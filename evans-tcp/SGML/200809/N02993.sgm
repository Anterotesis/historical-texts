<P>IT is no &s;mall Part of the Duty of Zion's Watch|men to ob&s;erve, and lead their People with them into a religious Improvement of Particu|lar Providences. And &s;ince the&s;e Days are very remarkable,&mdash;wherein the Heads of our Country are gone forth in &s;olemn Form to re|ceive and entertain the <HI>Me&s;&s;engers of the Nation</HI> in a Treaty with them on the very important Articles of Peace, and of their receiving the glorious Go&s;pel of Salvation; I have turned my Thoughts on this Subject as a proper Means of leading up our moved Affections to the pious Exerci&s;es that are proper on this great Occa&s;ion: Here every one, who con&s;idering the already di&s;tre&s;&s;ed State of the Land, and the many Evils that would attend a bloody War with the deceitful Heathen on our Borders &s;hall eagerly ask the important Que&s;tion, <HI>What &s;hall one then an&s;wer the Me&s;&s;engers of the Nation?</HI> Is furni&s;hed with an an&s;wer of Divine certainty, <HI>That the Lord hath founded Zion: and the Poor of his People &s;hall tru&s;t in it.</HI> The

Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> was &s;ent and continued by God to the back&s;liding <HI>Jews</HI> a very great while, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 1. 1. and the Subject of his large and excellent Prophe&s;y, be&s;ides that of it which relates to the Coming of Chri&s;t and Spreading of his Go&s;pel, is chiefly a Repre&s;enting to the Jews the great and dreadful Calamities which God would bring upon them for their Sins, and that by the <HI>A&s;&s;yrians, Chal|deans,</HI> &amp;c. And al&s;o his Re&s;toring them to Favour after a longtime; And puni&s;hing their Enemys in a mo&s;t fearful manner. God had nouri&s;hed up and increa&s;ed the Tribes of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> and <HI>Judah</HI> to be his own peculiar People, but they at length ba&s;ely for&s;ook the God of their Fathers, therefore he &s;tired up again&s;t them the Heathen that were round about them, and made them the Rod of his Anger, to puni&s;h that hypocritical Nation; But they, as is common in &s;uch Ca&s;es, went beyond their Commi&s;&s;ion as Executio|ners and lavi&s;h'd their own Rage and barbarous Cruelties upon the mi&s;erable People that were put into their Hands to be cha&s;ti&s;ed, (which temper it is likely made <HI>David</HI> avoid falling into the Hands of Men, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 24 14.) Therefore God would not leave them unpuni&s;hed, but by this Prophet fore|told their de&s;truction too. And among the&s;e Heathen E|nemys of the Lord's People, they who made no &s;mall Fi|gure were the <HI>Chaldeans</HI> on the North, who&s;e borders were va&s;tly extended, and their Metropolis was <HI>Babylon;</HI> And the <HI>Phili&s;tians</HI> on the South-we&s;t, and the De&s;olation of the&s;e two is foretold in the 13 &amp; 14 Chapters: And from the 28 ver&s;e of this chapter to that which I have named for my Text, is particularly exhibited the utter Downfall of the <HI>Phili&s;tians,</HI> who were &s;uch near and bad Neighbours and often &s;uch very cruel Enemies to the <HI>Jews.</HI> And it is very likely that they with the other neighbouring Na|tions might at that time look upon the Poverty of the <HI>Jews</HI> with Di&s;dain and enquire of them occa&s;ionally and tauntingly too, how they would e&s;cape being an ea&s;y Prey to their Enemies if there &s;hould be a War with them? And at the Conclu&s;ion of the&s;e Predictions, comes in my Text, which is an heroic Strain of the Prophet's Acknow|legement and Prai&s;e to the Sovereign Author of <HI>Juda'</HI>s Salvations, and a very pious Direction, &s;hewing how the Lord's defended People &s;hould improve &s;uch Favours.

The Am|ba&s;&s;adors of any People or Nation that &s;hould be &s;ent to the Jews on any Occa&s;ion what&s;oever: And of &s;uch Me&s;|&s;engers there is great and frequent Occa&s;ion in the Affairs of every Nation or People, to treat with one another on the important Bu&s;ine&s;s of Peace and War; to &s;ettle the limits of Trade and Commerce: Or to congratulate or condole with one another in particular Circum&s;tances, and the like.

<P>1. <HI>What is intended by Men's tru&s;ting in Zion, or the Church of God for Safety and Protection from their Ene|mies.</HI> 2. <HI>The Truth of the Doctrine</HI>&mdash;And 3. <HI>The Rea&s;on of the Doctrine as it relates to Men's Practice:</HI> Or <HI>the na|tural Connection that there is between Religion and temporal Safety</HI> To &s;hew,</P>

<HI>It &s;uppo&s;es their con&s;tant and indu&s;trious care in the ordi|nary Methods of Defence, hoping in and waiting for the ful|filment of Go&s;pel Promi&s;es in a way of careful and &s;incere O|bedience to the Rules of it.</HI> Such as expect the &s;pecial Ap|pearances of Providence to the obtaining for or &s;ecuring to them any Favour, mu&s;t carefully imploy all their own Powers in a regular way of obtaining that end for them|&s;elves, or el&s;e they expect that Favour in an unrea&s;onable way; for how can Men look that God &s;hould do any thing for them while they are either too lazy or too wil|ful to do what they can for them&s;elves? And this Argu|ment will appear in the mo&s;t convincing Light, if we con|&s;ider &s;uch Indolence, Wilfulne&s;s and Negligence, to be as they really are, a very great degree of di&s;obedience to and contempt of God, who has given them their Powers to be always u&s;ed in a rational Way. The impotent Man mu&s;t &s;trive to &s;tretch forth his hand at Chri&s;t's bidding, or el&s;e he could have had no hope of a Cure, <HI>Mat.</HI> 12. 13. And <HI>Gideon</HI> with his little Army mu&s;t go forth in Warlike Form again&s;t Midian, altho' God had determined to de|&s;troy tho&s;e Enemies miraculou&s;ly, <HI>Judg.</HI> 7. 15, &amp;c.</P>
<P>And having applied their own Care and Labour, they mu&s;t humbly look to God for the fulfilment of his Promi&s;es to them: And this naturally &s;uppo&s;es their pious Care to evidence, That they are indeed his People, for why el&s;e do they come to him? It mu&s;t be allowed by all, That they who expect the Favours of God's Church, mu&s;t be within its Walls, and this cannot be without obeying its Rules and Ordinances. And that Church or People who as a Body do yield a careful and &s;incere Obedience to the Rules of the Go&s;pel, do thereby di&s;|cover them&s;elves to be the Subjects and Servants of God, and may lay ju&s;t claim to his Patronage and Pro|tection, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 33 20, 22. And where this Obedience is wanting, they are the Enemies of God and may expect to be treated accordingly, what ever di&s;tingui&s;hing names of Virtue or Religion they may take to them&s;elves. While the Jews continued a pure Church, they al|ways had large experience of the Divine Honours and Protections &s;o be&s;towed on them, as that they knew it to be becau&s;e they were the Lord's People, and this
<PB N="5" REF="003587_0006_0FF878091A678D50">
mightily confirmed their Confidence &amp; Joy in God, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 62. 8. But at length they vainly run over to a carnal Con|fidence in the external part of their Church Privileges, while they &s;adly neglected the Spirit and Power of God|line&s;s. And God reproaches them for it, and profe&s;&s;es his de&s;ign to ca&s;t them off, altho' they were called by his Name, <HI>Jer.</HI> 7. <HI>begin</HI> to <HI>ver.</HI> 15. The Sum of all this is plain|ly &s;hewn in the Terms of that Covenant &s;tipulation, <HI>Jer.</HI> 7. 23. <HI>Obey my Voice and I will be your God, and ye &s;hall be my People, and walk ye in all the Ways that I have commanded you, that it may be well unto you</HI> Thus O|bedience is the only Evidence of our Subjection to God; and this Subjection is our only Title to Safety. <HI>Jotham'</HI>s Parable in <HI>Judg.</HI> 9. 15. in&s;tructs us here.</P>
<P>And then I come to &s;hew,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Truth of the Doctrine.</HI> And to render it plain and ea&s;y, I Premi&s;e,</P>
<P N="1">1. Re&s;pecting the Circum&s;tances of the People to be de|fended: <HI>That their greate&s;t Di&s;tre&s;s and Poverty, is no bar or difficulty in the way of their Protection, unle&s;s they have forfeited this by their di&s;obedience.</HI> So the Lord's People in the greate&s;t Di&s;tre&s;s and Poverty, are to tru&s;t in him, with whom it is equal to &s;ave by many or by few, by &s;trong or weak means. It was a time of &s;ore Affliction and Poverty in <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> which well might, and it is likely did make be|holders wonder, and enquire how they &s;hould be &s;ecured from becoming an ea&s;y prey to their neighbouring Enemies, unto which the An&s;wer in my Text refers, <HI>That the Lord hath founded Zion and the poor of his people &s;hall tru&s;t in it.</HI> And</P>
<P N="2">2. Re&s;pecting the extent of the temporal Protection of the Lord's People, exhibited in my Text and Doctrine: <HI>That altho' this is confirmed to them in the way of a Cove|nant,</HI> As 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 33. 7, 8. <HI>Jer.</HI> 7. 23, &amp; el&s;ewhere; <HI>O|bedience and Tru&s;t being the terms on their part, and Pro|tection and Safety the terms on God's part; and there|fore this is ju&s;tly to be looked upon as the determined and ordi|nary way in which God will deal with his People, and they may &s;afely depend upon it always: yet why may he not in his ab&s;olute Sovereignty &s;ometimes go out of this ordinary way, if he plea&s;es? But then it &s;hall always be for their extraordi|nary good:</HI> As in the ca&s;e of <HI>Job.</HI> Thus it is a Scripture
<PB N="6" REF="003587_0007_0FF8780AF6398FB0">
Rule, that all Men &s;hall dye: yet God &s;ometimes goes out of this ordinary way, by virtue of his own Royal Sovereign|ty: But then it is always better for them that are &s;o treated, then if they were dealt with in the ordinary way: As in the In&s;tances of <HI>Enoch</HI> and <HI>Elijah.</HI> And with con&s;tant re|&s;pect to the&s;e things premi&s;ed. I now proceed to &s;hew,</P>
<P><HI>The Truth of the Doctrine: That God hath &s;o e&s;tabli&s;hed his Church in the World, as that his people in their greate&s;t Poverty and Di&s;tre&s;s, may &s;afely tru&s;t therein for Protection from their Enemies.</HI> And this appears,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>From the Promi&s;es that God has made to his people, that it &s;hall be &s;o.</HI> As <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 132. 13, 14, &amp; 18. And God repeats His Promi&s;es of this kind to them in the Form of a Cove|nant, as <HI>Jer.</HI> 7. 23. And it is ju&s;tly reckoned among the grievous Aggravations of <HI>Mana&s;&s;eh'</HI>s &s;ins, that he &s;o ba&s;e|ly forfeited and de&s;pi&s;ed tho&s;e temporal Favours that were &s;o plainly made over to him in ca&s;e of his Obedience, 2 Chron. 33. 7, 8 <HI>And here I ob&s;erve; That tho' the&s;e Pro|mi&s;es were made directly to the Jews, yet being made to them as the Lord's People, they are to be applyed to all tho&s;e, to the end of the World, who can lay a ju&s;t claim to the Character of the Lord's People.</HI> Thus when the great charge &amp; bu&s;ine&s;s of conducting <HI>I&s;rael</HI> into the land of <HI>Canaan</HI> was laid upon <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> the Almighty to &s;upport and encourage him under that burden, made this Promi&s;e to him, Deut. 31. 8. <HI>And the Lord he it is that goeth before, he will be with thee, he will not fail thee, neither for&s;ake thee: Fear not</HI>&mdash;Which is applyed to all Chri&s;tians as an argument again&s;t Covete|ou&s;ne&s;s, and to promote our tru&s;t and dependance on Provi|dence, in the way of our Duty, Heb. 13. 5. 6.&mdash;<HI>For he hath &s;aid,</HI> (he &s;aid it to <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI>) <HI>I will never leave thee nor for|&s;ake thee, &s;o that we,</HI> we Chri&s;tians, unto the end of the World <HI>may boldly &s;ay; The Lord is my helper: And I will not fear what Man &s;hall do unto me.</HI> And the Truth of the Doctrine appears.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>From Scripture Hi&s;tory, wherein we &s;ee promi&s;ed delive|rance from their Enemies, con&s;tantly fulfilled for the Lord's Peo|ple, while they exerci&s;ed their dependance on him for it, evi|denced by their obedience.</HI> I might here mention a va&s;t &s;eries of great Salvations be&s;towed on <HI>I&s;rael</HI> on this &s;core, becau&s;e they were the Lord's People; and con&s;ider with what aw|ful

Terror and divine Maje&s;ty God him&s;elf was wont to come down to fight their Battles for them.

<P>&para; <HI>And God remarkably directed their Cour&s;e;</HI> for who can name any thing but even the miraculous Favours of Hea|ven that protected their Settlements when they came, full indeed of Faith and Good Works, but with their very &s;mall Numbers and very feeble Strength, into this va&s;t and cold Wilderne&s;s, full of the fierce Subjects of Satan, who gna&s;hed their Teeth and gaped upon them like voracious Dragons, and would have &s;wallowed them up alive as the Grave, and whole as tho&s;e that go down into the Pit: But the Lord blowed upon their frequent Attempts, and confounded their Coun&s;els when he remembred his Cove|nant for his Obedient People, who followed him into this de&s;ert Land: And he was not a Wilderne&s;s to them, or Land of Darkne&s;s, but gave them great Occa&s;ion to &s;ay as Hab. 3. 12. <HI>Thou did&s;t march through the Land in Indig|nation, thou did&s;t thre&s;h the Heathen in Anger.</HI> And &s;o vi|&s;ible was the hand of God in this Matter as to put that in|to their Mouth, P&s;al. 18. 29. <HI>For by thee I have run through a Troop.</HI> And Deut. 32. 30 <HI>How &s;hould one cha&s;e a thou|&s;and, and two put ten thou&s;and to flight.</HI>&mdash;Here we may en|numerate the frequent and fierce Sallies which the Hea|then with their cruel Multitudes made on them, but to their own &s;hame and damage, in the very early &s;ettling of the Country: And particularly the fir&s;t War which they formally made upon them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Pequot War</HI> Anno 1637.</NOTE> which though it was by the mo&s;t powerful, warlike, fierce and cruel of all the Tribes in the Land, who had of long time been a Terror to their neighbouring heathen Nations, and were then re&s;olved to blot out the New Engli&s;h Name in the Earth: Then the Sword of the Lord did &s;o vi&s;ibly pur&s;ue them, as to fini&s;h that War in a very few Months, and that with little Damage to the Engli&s;h, without the lo&s;s (I think) of one Life: But &s;uch fatal De&s;truction of the aggre&s;&s;ing Enemy, as hath &s;carce left the Name and Memory of them in the whole Earth.

<P>And it is very certain, that tho' every Town in the Land &s;hared very deeply in tho&s;e Calamities, yet <HI>the Manner in which they were then di&s;pen&s;ed to this Province, was very peculiar and very &s;trange.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The mo&s;t if not all of tho&s;e Towns in it, were &s;ingled out, which were Settled without the Go&s;pel, and (unle&s;s I mi&s;take the Hi&s;tory of the Country which I have diligently &s;earched) every one of them was broken up and utterly de&s;troyed<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">If any object here, the Towns in a neighbouring Province, which have &s;ometimes been all of the mo&s;t of them without the &s;ettled Ordinances of the Go&s;pel: It may be an&s;wered, That all tho&s;e erroneous Towns may be thought to have had the Go&s;pel preach|ed to them at that Day in a way which they &s;uppo&s;ed to be re|gular: And the erroneous in Religion are not to be reckoned in the Ca&s;e before us, with &s;uch as in a Land of Light do ca&s;t off the Form of Godline&s;s.

<P><HI>And again,</HI> It is con&s;tantly affirmed by all the Accounts that ever I could meet with, which &s;peak di&s;tinctly of the&s;e particular Settlements, <HI>That not one of all the many &s;mall and feeble Towns where the Ordinances of the Go&s;pel were &s;ettled, was de&s;troyed by them;</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The only Objection I ever met with again&s;t this Ob&s;ervation, is the Ca&s;e of <HI>Groton,</HI> who&s;e Inhabitants thought it be&s;t to draw off, and &s;tay till the War was over, which they did with their Goods, except one Garri&s;on which was kept there and never taken.

<P>The&s;e things I have ob&s;erved with great Admiration and Awe, in reading the Hi&s;tories of our Country; and I think
<PB N="15" REF="003587_0016_0FF833AB71429880">
it a pious Care to collect and &s;et them in order for the Ob|&s;ervation of others; I am &s;ure it will &s;tir up the Admira|tion of every con&s;iderate and the Care of every pious Mind. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 78. <HI>begin.</HI> And I am now to &s;hew,</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The Rea&s;on of the Doctrine as it relates to Men's Prac|tice:</HI> Or, <HI>The natural connection there is between Religion and Safety.</HI> And here I ob&s;erve, that all human Actions in this Life run into the&s;e two Channels; the &s;ervice of God, or of the Devil, for into the&s;e two &s;orts all mankind are devided; the Children and Servants of God, and of the Devil; and there is no middle State, <HI>Rom.</HI> 6 16.</P>
<P><HI>And</HI> as it is ea&s;y for every one to &s;ee how the Service of the Devil, naturally tends to make Men like him, deceit|ful, unju&s;t, cruel, contentious, and very mi&s;erable; for he would fain make all his followers like him&s;elf, both in Sin and Torment if he could; Hence &s;ome of them we &s;ee grow very near like him in many of his bad Qualities. From &s;uch as are then in his Service al&s;o, come all the Lies, Inju&s;tice, Treachery and Quarrels which are often nouri&s;h|ed up to fierce and cruel Words, Blood&s;hed and War. <HI>Jan.</HI> 4 <HI>begin.</HI></P>
<P><HI>So on the other hand,</HI> The Service of God marvelou&s;ly tends to de&s;troy this Image and work of the Devil, and to beautify Men with the likene&s;s of the mo&s;t glorious and excellent Being: It makes them knowing, wi&s;e, ju&s;t, kind, holy and happy; for Holine&s;s and Happine&s;s will certainly go together. It is a &s;ure Truth &amp; plain to human Rea&s;on if contemplated, that Virtue &amp; Vice have their natural ef|fect in Happine&s;s and Mi&s;ery by the eternal and unchange|able rea&s;on of things, &amp; it is impo&s;&s;ible it &s;hould be other|wi&s;e. And it would be a plea&s;ant task, were there time now, to &s;hew in particulars, how and wherein the Rules of the Go&s;pel do all of them naturally tend by promoting every virtue to advance the temporal Peace and Happine&s;s of every one that ob&s;erves them, and that in a plain and ea&s;y method: For be&s;ides the more &s;piritual Duties of Vir|tue and Godline&s;s, which the World can't &s;o well &s;ee into, they learn Men to live &s;oberly and righteou&s;ly, <HI>Tit.</HI> 2. 12. which if complied with, would take away all occa&s;ion of injury, contention &amp; figthing. Let any one view the mo&s;t difficult ca&s;es that are ever mentioned as the cau&s;e of War,
<PB N="16" REF="003587_0017_0FF833AE943A6010">
and &s;ee if a compliance in both parties with that Ju&s;tice, neighbourly Kindne&s;s and Charity, which the Go&s;pel re|quires, would not &s;peedily cure all, &amp; confirm their Peace and Friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>And if an unrighteous People &s;hould &s;eek occa&s;ion of War again&s;t their Neighbours when they had none ju&s;tly, yet if the injured party would be &s;o politic, as well as happy, as to treat them in every Article according to the temper of the Go&s;pel, they would thereby bring &s;uch a vi&s;ible and acknowledged guilt upon their aggre&s;&s;ing Adver&s;aries as would certainly render them &s;elf condemned, tho' they were the darke&s;t Heathen, <HI>Rom.</HI> 2. 15. And condemned in the Eyes of the re&s;t of the World; and how natural and great an effect this would have in disheartning them and incouraging and &s;ecuring the other party, let any one judge.</P>
<P><HI>And add to this,</HI> The regular claim that Innocence, Vir|tue and Religion enable Men to lay to the &s;pecial Protec|tion of that Providence which over-rules all things.</P>
<P><HI>And finally,</HI> The Covenant which God hath made with his People, exhibited in the plain and explicit Promi&s;es of the Go&s;pel, that their Obedience to, and tru&s;t in him, &s;hall intitle them to his Favour and Protection, do &s;ufficiently evidence the rea&s;on of my fir&s;t Doctrine, while they not only determine the&s;e to be the People of the Lord; But al&s;o, if they behave as herein before de&s;cribed, that their Enemies are the Enemies of the Lord too; and then it is ea&s;y to &s;ee their End. And &s;o I pa&s;s to con&s;ider,</P>
<P>Doct. 2. <HI>That it is the Duty of the Lord's People, very carefully to let others, and e&s;pecially the Heathen round about them know what their Dependance is.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>This di&s;covers their Humility and De&s;ire of giving to God the Glory and Prai&s;e of his Goodne&s;s unto them in their Pre&s;ervation.</HI> Both the&s;e are very nece&s;&s;ary Chri&s;tian Du|ties, and of near Relation to each other, for it is only the humble Man that can find in his Heart to <HI>give unto the Lord the Glory due unto his Name.</HI> And the contrary to this is a Sin very provoking to God and very plea&s;ing to proud Man; He would fain think much of him&s;elf; &amp; even good Men are &s;adly apt to be guilty this Way. This was doubt|le&s;s the &s;in of that great &amp; good King <HI>Hezekiah, I&s;a.</HI> 39 <HI>beg.</HI> He &s;hould have told tho&s;e Me&s;&s;engers of the King of Baby|lon,
<PB N="17" REF="003587_0018_0FF82C1A8D183410">
how God had brought his People I&s;rael into a &s;trange Land, and driven out the Heathen to make Room for them, that they might be his peculiar People; and that if they did continue clo&s;e in their obedience to him, he would al|ways defend them from their Enemies; and that this was their Strength, Refuge and Defence in Dangers. Such a &s;hew might have &s;tirred up tho&s;e Emba&s;&s;adors to enquire after I&s;rael's God, and come by degrees into Terms of O|bedience to him, for the &s;ake of his Protection; at lea&s;t it would have created great Thoughts of <HI>Jehovah</HI> in the Mind of the King of Babylon and of his Servants: But in&s;tead of this, the King &s;hewed them that which might make him&s;elf and his People appear Honourable, Magnificent and Terri|ble in their own Strength and Grandeur; &s;uch as his Build|ings, Wealth, Armour, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> And God was angry at it and &s;ent the Prophet to reprove him for it, &amp; to a&s;&s;ure him that all tho&s;e things which he had gloried in &s;hould be &s;o far from defending him, as that they &s;hould be carried away into Babylon, <HI>ver&s;e</HI> 5, &amp;<HI>c.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>This would have a natural tendency to bring others e&s;|pecially the Heathen, unto the &s;ame methods of Piety, and glo|rifying God.</HI> To &s;ee a flouri&s;hing People very careful and diligent in the ob&s;ervance of all Religious Duties, and o|penly profe&s;&s;ing that they did this in Obedience to that God who had exceedingly favoured them even in the eye of the World, and would certainly appear for their &s;afety and defence at all times, unle&s;s they for&s;ook him; would put others upon ob&s;erving them; and if they found &s;uch grave and &s;erious Profe&s;&s;ion and &s;teady Practice of pious Obedience con&s;tantly per&s;i&s;ted in, accompanied al&s;o with &s;ignal outward Favours beyond others, it mu&s;t needs pro|voke them to &s;eek terms of Communion with this God too. And this would e&s;pecially prevail on the Heathen who are wont to &s;erve Gods that are deceitful, fal&s;e and cruel to them, leading them into perplexities and &s;traits, and often de&s;troying their own mo&s;t obedient Servants.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>This method would powerfully tend to make good Neigh|bours of the mo&s;t dark</HI> &amp; <HI>barbarous Heathen.</HI> If they could once be learned to obey the Go&s;pel, it would be &s;afe living by them.

the Redeemer, who at his own expence &amp; labour bro't that Salvation to a dark and wretched World, which the Lord's People have all their dependence upon.</P>
<P><HI>And now to apply the&s;e things.</HI> Let us be put upon the utmo&s;t care and diligence to maintain the Character of the Lord's People, as the only, and a very &s;ure way of &s;afety here and hereafter.</P>
<P>Bear in mind always, that the very Foundation of the Country, &s;tands upon our carefully ob&s;erving and promo|ting the pure Ordinances of the Go&s;pel. For this being &s;o great a part of the avowed de&s;ign of the fir&s;t Settlers, and by them pleaded with God as a rea&s;on of his Protecting them. And &s;o wonderfully an&s;wered in the Divine Fa|vours more eminently be&s;towed on them, than on any other People did virtually e&s;tabli&s;h it into a Covenant, as <HI>Jer.</HI> 7. 23. We are therefore more obliged to ob&s;erve, in|courage and promote the Go&s;pel, than any People living; which I be&s;eech you always to remember, <HI>For it is not a vain thing for you: becau&s;e it is your Life; and through this thing ye &s;hall prolong your days in the land</HI>&mdash;Deut. 32. 47. And can we think that the jealous God will bear long with us, if we for&s;ake this tru&s;t? Would Men bear to be &s;o created?
