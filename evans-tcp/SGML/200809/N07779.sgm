<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE making any apology for the following pub|lication would be needle&s;s, the &s;ubjects of it are &s;o highly intere&s;ting and important, &s;hould they be &s;et in a clear and ju&s;t point of light: If they are not, no excu&s;e can ju&s;tifie the Author for medling with that he had better let alone. It mu&s;t be left with the reader to judge in this matter. In the mean time, I may &s;ay, in behalf of my &s;elf, that I have endeavoured, not without con&s;iderable pains, to collect from the &s;cripture what it &s;ays, in differ|ent places, concerning the &s;everal truths here treated on; and to place it in one connected view, and in as di&s;tinct and per&s;picuous a manner as I could. I have purpo&s;ely avoided all pomp of words, and all &s;hew of learned &s;ubtlety by the artful u&s;e of &s;chola&s;tic, &s;y&s;tema|tical, and metaphy&s;ical terms; &s;tudying to deliver my &s;elf &s;o as that I might be ea&s;ily under&s;tood. If I have wrote in a my&s;tical, perplexed, unintelligible way, I own it is a fault not to be overlooked; and
<PB N="ii" REF="009925_0003_0F7B388050F5FEC8">
am willing to &s;ubmit to de&s;erved cha&s;ti&s;ement: And the rather, as it is, with me, a &s;ettled point, that if a man writes &s;o as that it is difficult, if po&s;&s;ible, to under&s;tand, and a&s;certain, his real meaning, his thoughts are confu&s;ed and unconnected, as they lie in his mind; or he has been inexcu&s;ably carele&s;s in ranging and expre&s;&s;ing them; or, what is wor&s;e, he has &s;ome covered de&s;ign to &s;erve, by entrenching him&s;elf in darkne&s;s and ambiguity.</P>
<P>If any &s;hould think it worth while to read the&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es, I would advi&s;e them to receive nothing, they may meet with in them, as "the truth of God", till they have impartially examined what is offered in proof of it as &s;uch, from the &s;acred books; and are there|upon convinced, in their con&s;ciencies, that it really is &s;o. Their faith will now &s;tand on a &s;afe and &s;ure ba&s;is, the word of him, who&s;e &s;tile is that, "faithful and true". And this, I would add, is the only way in which we &s;hould always read the writings of others, upon the &s;acred doctrines of &s;cripture, however high an opinion we may have of their integrity, capacity, or &s;uperior knowledge in divine things. We &s;hall now u&s;e their labors as "helps", (which we rea&s;on|ably may) in order to our under&s;tanding the ju&s;t im|port of the &s;cripture; and &s;hall found our faith, not on what they &s;ay, but on what we are enabled, by their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to perceive to be the word and will of God.</P>
<P>It would be extraordinary, if, thro' carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, inattention, or the undue influence of &s;ome wrong bia&s;s or other, I have not been led into a mi&s;-con|ception of &s;ome of the "many texts", I have en|deavoured to explain: Tho' I am not &s;en&s;ible, that
<PB N="iii" REF="009925_0004_0F7B3940858325E8">
this is the ca&s;e. If I have been mi&s;taken, I have not knowingly been &s;o. It is owing to the want of more under&s;tanding, and a better judgment, rather than to any fault in my will. The <HI>HOLY BIBLE,</HI> and not any "human &s;y&s;tem", or "fallible compo|&s;ure", has been my governing rule, in what I have pre&s;ented to the view of others: Nor have I &s;aid any thing but as it appeared to me, upon a clo&s;e in|quiry, to agree with this <HI>ONLY TEST</HI> of revealed truth.</P>
<P>Po&s;&s;ibly, there are &s;ome, who, upon reading what is herewith emitted, &amp; perceiving its contrariety to their peculiar &s;entiments, may be in a temper of mind, at once, to &s;peak of me, in their zeal, as a perverter of the "truth as it is in Je&s;us", and to &s;uch a degree as to be in a &s;tate of wrath. Such cen&s;orious judg|ing will give me no di&s;turbance, &s;o long as tho&s;e words are to be found legibly wrote in the in&s;pired books, "who art thou that judge&s;t another man's &s;ervant? To his own ma&s;ter he &s;tandeth, or fall|eth.&mdash;Why do&s;t thou judge thy brother?&mdash;We &s;hall all &s;tand before the judgment-&s;eat of Chri&s;t". Men's a&s;&s;uming to them&s;elves a right to determine what is "truth", or "fal&s;ehood", and to a&s;certain the doom of others as they agree, or di&s;agree, with &s;uch deter|mination; e&s;pecially, if they do it with great po&s;i|tivene&s;s and a&s;&s;urance, as though they were divinely authori&s;ed, and infallible, judges in the ca&s;e, may &s;tartle weak minds, and powerfully tend to impre&s;s on them a wrong bia&s;s: But it can convey no light in|to the under&s;tandings of any. It may excite a various motion in the pa&s;&s;ions of tho&s;e, who de&s;pi&s;e &s;uch airs of &s;uperiority and importance; and &s;eldom fails of doing &s;o: But it can have no rational aptitude to
<PB N="iv" REF="009925_0005_0F7B394142B4EEA0">
rectifie their mi&s;takes, if they labor of any; or to effect an alteration, for the better, in their &s;enti|ments. It would argue a more manly, not to &s;ay chri&s;tian &s;pirit, to endeavour their conviction only by fair and ju&s;t rea&s;oning from the &s;criptures. This would be to apply to them as rea&s;onable creatures; and in no other way can we properly do &s;o.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only &s;ay further, the temper of my mind, re&s;pecting the following work, is &s;uch, that I find within my &s;elf a freedom as heartily to wi&s;h, on the one hand, that it may meet with no acceptance in the world, if fited "to deceive unwary &s;ouls, and turn them a&s;ide from the &s;implicity of the go&s;pel"; as, on the other, that it may be received with ap|probation, and admited into the hearts of all that &s;hall read it, if it &s;hould exhibit, as I tru&s;t it does, "the truth of the go&s;pel", by which we may be &s;aved.</P>

<HEAD>SERMON I. Ju&s;tification impo&s;&s;ible by the Works of the Law.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>GALATIANS II. 16.</BIBL>
<P>"Knowing that a man is not ju&s;tified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, even we have believed in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that we might be ju&s;tified by the faith of Chri&s;t, and not by the works of the law: For by the works of the law &s;hall no fle&s;h be ju&s;tified."</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE fir&s;t and la&s;t clau&s;e in this ver&s;e are expre&s;s in affirming negatively, that the method of ju&s;tification before God is not by "the works of the law". And the affirma|tion extends univer&s;ally; taking in one man as well as another, mankind without di&s;tinction or di&s;crimination. "Knowing that a man is not ju&s;tified by the works of the law". The words
<PB N="2" REF="009925_0007_0F7B3942848D0230">
are &s;poken, not of any particular man, but of man as &s;ignifying the whole &s;pecies, every individual that is of the rank we call men. So the Apo&s;tle explains him&s;elf in the other clau&s;e of the ver&s;e, "by the works of the law &s;hall no fle&s;h be ju&s;ti|fied"; that is, no partaker of human fle&s;h, no man, whether he be Jew or Gentile, no one of the race of Adam. In this &s;en&s;e preci&s;ely the phra&s;e, "no fle&s;h", is u&s;ed by this &s;ame Apo&s;tle, when &s;peak|ing, in the following chapter, ver. 11. upon this &s;ame &s;ubject. Says he, "no man is ju&s;tified by the law in the &s;ight of God". In agreement wherewith is that prayer of pious David, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm 143.2.</NOTE> "en|ter not into judgment with thy &s;ervant", as grounded upon this rea&s;on, "for in thy &s;ight &s;hall no man living be ju&s;tified".</P>
<P>IN further &s;peaking to the text it will be pro|per to explain the terms "ju&s;tifie", and "the works of the law". The way will then be clear to illu&s;trate the truth here affirmed, that "no fle&s;h", no man, "can be ju&s;tified by the&s;e works".</P>
<P>AS to the term "ju&s;tifie", it is not an original Engli&s;h word, but borrowed from a Latin one (ju&s;tificare): Neither is this latin word of anci|ent u&s;e among the be&s;t Roman writers; <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vid. Sir Charles Wol&s;eley, on ju&s;tification evan|gelical.</NOTE> but has been introduced &s;ince, by chri&s;tian divines, to expre&s;s the &s;en&s;e of a &s;cripture one, often to be met with, particularly in the Apo&s;tle Paul's epi|&s;tles, e&s;pecially his epi&s;tles to the Romans and the Galatians. It's meaning is not, to make ju&s;t; as
<PB N="3" REF="009925_0008_0F7B39438066DC08">
to &s;anctifie is to make holy. This may &s;eem to be the &s;en&s;e of the word, judging by its etymology. But its rarely, if ever, u&s;ed, in the in&s;pired pages, as carrying in it this meaning. Tis rather to be under&s;tood in a law-&s;en&s;e, alluding to the acquit|ance of an accu&s;ed per&s;on upon a legal proce&s;s, and his being accounted ju&s;t in oppo&s;ition to the charge that was exhibited again&s;t him. It ac|cordingly &s;ignifies to approve, accept, vindicate or adjudge as ju&s;t. We &s;hall exemplifie this in a few in&s;tances. The holy God is applied to in tho&s;e words, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Kin. 8.32.</NOTE> "hear thou in heaven, and judge thy &s;ervants; condemning the wicked, and ju&s;ti|fying the righteous". Where, "ju&s;tifying the righteous" does not &s;ignifie, the making them righteous; but appearing for them in judgment, and vindicating them as &s;uch. It is affirmed, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Prov. 17.5.</NOTE> "He that ju&s;tifieth the wicked is an abomination to the Lord". By "ju&s;tifying the wicked" is not meant, the making them qualitatively ju&s;t: This would be well-plea&s;ing to God: But it &s;ig|nifies a pleading for them, and defending them in judgment as ju&s;t, while, at the &s;ame time, they are wicked. Hence that threatning of the Pro|phet, <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. 5.21.23.</NOTE> "Wo unto them, who ju&s;tifie the wicked for a reward"; that is, vindicate them in judg|ment as righteous per&s;ons, when the rever&s;e is their true character. And the word is u&s;ed in this &s;ame &s;en&s;e in the New-te&s;tament. "Not the hearers of the law are ju&s;t before God, but the doers of the law &s;hall be ju&s;tified";<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Rom. 2.13.</NOTE> that is, &s;hall be accounted and declared ju&s;t in judgment. So tis &s;aid of the Publican, in the go&s;pel of Luke, <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Chap. 18.14.</NOTE>
<PB N="4" REF="009925_0009_0F7B394431B03318">
that he "went down to his hou&s;e ju&s;tified rather than the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hari&s;ee"; that is, approved by God, and accepted as ju&s;t. In like manner we read, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom&punc; 8.33, 34.</NOTE> "Who &s;hall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that ju&s;tifieth. Who is he that condemneth? It is Chri&s;t that died". By "God's ju&s;tifying", we are evidently to under&s;tand his ac|quiting and vindicating in judgment as ju&s;t; for it here &s;tands oppo&s;ed to condemnation.&mdash;But I need not multiply in&s;tances. Tis generally al|lowed, on all &s;ides, that the word, "ju&s;tifie", is u&s;ed in this judicial &s;en&s;e throughout the &s;crip|tures; at lea&s;t in a &s;en&s;e refering to this, and cor|re&s;ponding with it. Th&ocirc; it ought to be remem|ber'd, and heedfully remarked here, that no one can, in con&s;i&s;tency with truth, be judicially de|clared ju&s;t, unle&s;s he really is &s;o in the eye of that rule, whatever it is, by which he is tried; and, in con&s;equence of this, we may be &s;ure, that the righteous judge of all the earth will never approve of any man as ju&s;t, and pronounce him to be &s;o, if this be not the truth of his character, when com|pared with the mea&s;ure of judgment in his ca&s;e.</P>
<P>"WORKS of the law" are the other terms to be explained. Now, by "law", the Apo&s;tle &s;ome|times means law "in general", both the "law written in men's hearts", and in "the books of revelation". Sometimes he u&s;es the word more re&s;trainedly to &s;ignifie the "Mo&s;aic law" in &s;pecial. But whether he under&s;tands by it the "natural" or "revealed law", or law "including both", works done in conformity to it, when mentioned with reference to ju&s;tification, he always &s;ets a&s;ide
<PB N="5" REF="009925_0010_0F7B3946A364E9C0">
as totally in&s;ufficient for the procurement of it. Accordingly, when he affirms, that, "by the works of the law, no one &s;hall be ju&s;tified", the th&ocirc;t he would convey is obviou&s;ly this, that ju&s;tification is not obtainable "upon the foot of law", upon any claim grounded on works done in obedience to it. As if he had &s;aid, no man, whe|ther he be Jew or Gentile, naked law, law con|&s;idered &s;imply in it&s;elf, being the rule of judg|ment, can be accounted, accepted or vindicated as ju&s;t, upon the &s;core of any works he has per|formed in obedience to it: Neither the Jew, up|on works he has done in compliance with the law as publi&s;hed by Mo&s;es; nor the Gentile, upon the works he has done in obedience to the law of nature. And it may be added with equal truth, nei|ther can the chri&s;tian be ju&s;tified in the meer vir|tue of any works he has wro't in compliance with the law, as promulged in the go&s;pel by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and his apo&s;tles. In &s;hort, all works, whether of Jews, Pagans, or Chri&s;tians, are excluded from ju&s;tification, law, rigid law, being the rule of tryal. They are totally and ab&s;olutely in&s;ufficient to procure for any man living an acquitance in judgment, a vindication as ju&s;t and righteous.</P>
<P>AND this, the way being prepared for it, I now come to make evident to you: In the doing of which I &s;hall take the Apo&s;tle Paul for my in|&s;tructor and guide. He, of all the &s;acred writers, is the mo&s;t frequent and peremptory in affirming, that ju&s;tification is obtainable by no &s;on of Adam upon a plea of works, done in conformity to meer law. Nor does he barely a&s;&s;ert this, but greatly enlarges in the proof of it. I &s;hall make u&s;e of his
<PB N="6" REF="009925_0011_0F7B394729F414F0">
arguments upon this head, and endeavour to &s;et them in a point of light that may be convincing.</P>
<P>IN his epi&s;tle to the Romans, he has di&s;tinctly and largely proved, that mankind univer&s;ally are &s;inners, and therefore incapable of attaining to "the ju&s;tification of life" upon the terms of naked law. The proof he has exhibited of this is con|tained in the three fir&s;t chapters of this epi&s;tle; where we &s;hall find a very melancholy account of the degenerate &s;tate, the whole world, then con|&s;i&s;ting of Jews and Gentiles, had &s;unk into. It cannot indeed be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the character he here draws of the Jews &amp; Gentiles ju&s;tly belonged, in all its lineaments, to either of them INDIVI|DUALLY con&s;idered. There were, doubtle&s;s, a|mong the&s;e bodies of men a con&s;iderable number, who had "e&s;caped the pollutions" that were com|mon in that day "thr&ocirc; lu&s;t": Nay, there is no rea&s;on to think but that &s;ome, at lea&s;t, of the INDI|VIDUALS that con&s;tituted the&s;e collective bodies, were really good men, in the &s;en&s;e in which the in&s;pired Solomon &s;ays, "a good man obtaineth favor of the Lord". But &s;till, it was true of them all, that they "had gone out of the way": Not indeed equally, con&s;idered as INDIVIDUALS, but in various degrees; &s;ome in one degree, o|thers in another; but the generality in an high degree: in&s;omuch that the apo&s;tle might ju&s;tly de&s;cribe them, in the gro&s;s, as awfully corrupt. For this was the real truth of their character; tho' it might be &s;aid of &s;ome of them, in the <HI>indi|vidual</HI> &s;en&s;e, that they were &s;inners in that view only in which it is affirmed, "there is not a ju&s;t man that &s;inneth not".</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="009925_0012_0F7B3947E9A1C6A0">
AND that it was the intention of the apo&s;tle to give us to under&s;tand, that both Jews &amp; Gen|tiles, mankind in common, were &s;inners indivi|dually, as well as in a collective &s;en&s;e, would &s;eem evident beyond all rea&s;onable di&s;pute. Why el&s;e &s;hould he u&s;e the terms of univer&s;ality? Why the &s;tronge&s;t ones the language could furni&s;h him with? And why &s;hould he, as it were, heap them upon one another? He is not content with &s;ay|ing, "all have &s;inned"; but in&s;i&s;ts that "there is none righteous, no not one"; that "there is none that doth good, no not one"; and that "all are gone out of the way". Surely, the&s;e terms mu&s;t take in a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the individuals of the human kind without exception. Had it been his de&s;ign to include the whole world of men, he could not have expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in words more full to his purpo&s;e. Be&s;ides, the conclu&s;ion he introduces from the foregoing premi&s;es requires, that the terms u&s;ed in them &s;hould be explained in this univer&s;al &s;en&s;e. How el&s;e could he &s;ay, "we have before proved, that every mouth is &s;top|ped", and that "all the world are become guilty before God"? How el&s;e could he infer, "there|fore by the deeds of the law &s;hall no fle&s;h be ju&s;ti|fied in God's &s;ight"? And how el&s;e could he argue, that we are "ju&s;tified freely by his grace," that is, by an act of his meer favor, in oppo&s;ition to every plea as grounded on works done in obe|dience to the law, and to the utter exclu&s;ion of all boa&s;ting?</P>
<P>IT &s;hould &s;eem indubitably clear, that the Apo|&s;tle's aim was to prove the impo&s;&s;ibility of ju&s;ti|fication upon terms of law, and that his long thread
<PB N="8" REF="009925_0013_0F7B394885F636F0">
of rea&s;oning&punc; in the&s;e chapters, was principally intended to &s;ettle this important point. But if, in con&s;equence of what he has offered, it is not fact, that both Jews and Gentiles are &s;inners in the account of law, con&s;idered <HI>individually</HI> and <HI>univer&s;ally,</HI> there is no argumentative connection between the point in view, and the rea&s;oning u&s;ed to defend and &s;upport it. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ay, if it were true of ANY ONE INDIVIDUAL, whether in the Jewi&s;h or Gentile world, that he was not a &s;inner, judging of his character by meer law, the apo&s;tle has left his doctrine of the "unattainablene&s;s of ju&s;tifica|tion upon the foot of law" without any &s;olid proof; at lea&s;t in regard of that <HI>univer&s;ality,</HI> in which he has a&s;&s;erted, and endeavoured to maintain it. He can, in a word, be looked upon as a coherent con|clu&s;ive writer upon no other &s;cheme than this, that Jews and Gentiles, <HI>individually</HI> as well <HI>col|lectively</HI> con&s;idered, were &s;inners in the view of law, and therefore not within the po&s;&s;ibility of being ju&s;tified upon a tryal by &s;o &s;evere a rule.</P>
<P>I MAY not improperly remark here, that the apo&s;tle's rea&s;oning, with re&s;pect to the unattain|ablene&s;s of ju&s;tification upon the terms of law, ought to be con&s;idered, as refering, not only to mankind as they exi&s;ted at the time when he wrote, but in all after-ages of the world&punc; For the con&s;equence he deduces, from his method of rea&s;oning, is in tho&s;e &s;trong terms of univer&s;ality, "therefore, by the deeds of the law, there &s;hall no fle&s;h be ju&s;tified in his &s;ight". "No fle&s;h", that is, no &s;on of Adam, nor one of the human race. Nor, unle&s;s he is to be under&s;tood as tak|ing into his meaning mankind in all ages, have
<PB N="9" REF="009925_0014_0F7B3949418E4120">
we, in the&s;e days, any concern with his doctrine of "ju&s;tification without law": Whereas, he mo&s;t certainly wrote with a view to after-ages as well as that in which he lived; de&s;igning to affirm and prove, that no &s;on of man, in any age, till the end of time, could be ju&s;tified upon law-terms: be|cau&s;e, in the eye of law, they could not but be found guilty before God. And the plain truth is, his rea&s;oning, upon this head, is as applicable to mankind univer&s;ally in the&s;e days, as to man|kind at the time when he wrote his epi&s;tle. For it is as true now as it was then, and has all along been &s;o, that they have univer&s;ally &s;inned. Not that mankind, in all ages, have been &s;inners ju&s;t in the &s;ame degree as in the apo&s;tle's days: But they now are, and always have been, and always will be, &s;inners in &s;uch a &s;en&s;e as that tis impo&s;&s;i|ble they &s;hould be ju&s;tified by the rule of &s;trict law.</P>
<P>AND this account of his rea&s;oning, it is ob|&s;ervable, perfectly coincides with the repre&s;enta|tions that are every where el&s;e, in &s;cripture, given of this matter. Says the in&s;pired David,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. 130.2.</NOTE> "If thou, Lord, &s;houlde&s;t mark iniquities; O Lord, who &s;hall &s;tand"? And again,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. 143.2.</NOTE> "enter not into judg|ment with thy &s;ervant; for in thy &s;ight no man living &s;hall be ju&s;tified".

If he contend with him, he can|not an&s;wer him for one of a thou&s;and". To the &s;ame purpo&s;e &s;till are tho&s;e words of Solomon, <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Eccle&s;. 7.20.</NOTE> "There is not a ju&s;t man upon the earth that

doth good, and &s;inneth not". Agreable whereto the Apo&s;tle John a&s;&s;ures us, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Epi&s;t. 1.8.</NOTE> that "if we &s;ay we have no &s;in, we deceive our&s;elves, and the truth is not in us": Yea, he declares <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 10.</NOTE> that "if we &s;ay we have not &s;inned, we &s;hall make God a liar, and his word is not in us".</P>
<P>I MAY pertinently add here, this &s;criptural ac|count of our being univer&s;ally &s;inners, in the eye of law, mo&s;t evidently accords with the experience of every man living. Who can lay his hand upon his heart, and &s;ay, that it is clear of all &s;in? Who can look into his life, and declare with truth, that it has not, in a le&s;s or greater degree, been &s;tained with "the pollutions that are in the world thro' lu&s;t? If any are thus pure in heart, and have given proof of it by their "holine&s;s in all manner of conver&s;ation", they mu&s;t be tho&s;e good men, who, with pious David, "have walked in their integrity". And are there any among the&s;e who have never deviated from the path of duty? Not one. They "have all &s;inned, and come &s;hort of the glory of God". And they are deeply &s;en&s;i|ble of it, and herefrom in readine&s;s to exclaim with the P&s;almi&s;t, <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. 19.12.</NOTE> "Who can under&s;tand his errors"! and to join with him in the prayer to God which follows, "clean&s;e thou me from &s;ecret faults". Far from imagining that they are per|fect, and able, on account of their innocency, to &s;tand a tryal at the bar of &s;trict law, they adopt the words of upright Job, <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Job 9.20.</NOTE> humbly con|fe&s;&s;ing, "if we ju&s;tifie our&s;elves, our own mouths would condemn us: If we &s;hould &s;ay we are per|fect, it &s;hall al&s;o prove us perver&s;e".

<P>OR of what is expre&s;&s;ed in &s;till more &s;triking language by an in&s;pired pen, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. 7.15, 19.</NOTE> "What I would, that I do not; but what I hate, that I do. The good that I would, I do not; and the evil that I would not, that I do".</P>
<P>NOW, if all men are &s;inners, as having tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ed the law, how can they be ju&s;tified upon the foot of law? It is not po&s;&s;ible. Law, &s;trict law, being the rule by which they are tried, con|demnation, and that only, mu&s;t be the judicial re&s;ult of a procedure upon their ca&s;e. Should they be declared legally ju&s;t, the &s;entence would exhibit a manife&s;t fal&s;ehood; it would be the effect of perverted judgment. For nothing &s;hort of obedience without a failure, in any in&s;tance of duty, re&s;pecting either heart or life, could en|title them to an acquitance as righteous per&s;ons. Could it be pleaded in their favor, that they had in &s;ome in&s;tances yielded obedience to the law, this would be of no avail; becau&s;e, in other in|&s;tances, they had violated it, and the law de|manded
<PB N="12" REF="009925_0017_0F7B394DBB064E48">
obedience in the&s;e violated in&s;tances as truly as in the other. He that would be ju&s;ti|fied by his works, upon the terms of law, mu&s;t not have one bad work among them all; for one bad one only, tho' it &s;hould be attended with a great many good ones, would as certainly, if not in &s;o high a degree, expo&s;e him to a &s;entence of condemnation, as if his works were all bad, with the exception of one only that was good. Law, &s;imple naked law, &s;hews no favor. That is its language, "this do, and thou art righteous. If thou doe&s;t it not, thou art a &s;inner." The con|&s;equence wherefrom plainly is, that every man in the world, as he is a tran&s;gre&s;&s;or of the law, whe|ther he has tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed it in all in&s;tances or many, in a few or one only, is, on that account, in a &s;tate of guilt, in the eye of the law, and therefore incapable of being ju&s;tified by it. For tis a plain ca&s;e, the law can fa&s;ten guilt upon no man, and at the &s;ame time acquit him as inno|cent. Tis impo&s;&s;ible a &s;entence of approbation and condemnation &s;hould be the legal i&s;&s;ue of a proce&s;s upon the &s;ame law, at the &s;ame time. This would be a glaring contradiction.</P>
<P>THUS I have dilated upon, and explained at large, one of the arguments the apo&s;tle Paul has u&s;ed in proof of his a&s;&s;ertion, "that no fle&s;h", no man, "can be ju&s;tified by the works of the law". And it carries with it the &s;tronge&s;t conviction. Tis indeed an ab&s;olutely conclu&s;ive one; and the more clo&s;ely and &s;trictly it is examined, the more clearly it will appear to be &s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="009925_0018_0F7B394DC680CB80">
ANOTHER argument of this &s;ame Apo&s;tle, in proof of this &s;ame point, and coinciding with that we have been con&s;idering, is to be met with in his epi&s;tle to the Galatians. Says he,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. 3.10.</NOTE> "As many as are of the works of the law, are under the cur&s;e". As if he had &s;aid, they who expect to be ju&s;tified upon the foot of works done in con|formity to the law, be they as many as you will, they are all cur&s;ed by the law. And why? The rea&s;on follows in the next words, "for it is writ|ten, cur&s;ed is every one that continueth not in all things written in the book of the law to do them". As if he had &s;aid, the &s;cripture writes tho&s;e ac|cur&s;ed, in the e&s;timation of the law, who had not done, and gone on to do, all things that are enjoined by it. He does not proceed in a formal manner to prove, that no man has ever thus an&s;wered the requirements of the law; but leaves it with the con&s;cience of every man to de|clare to him the truth of this fact. And as every man has a witne&s;s within him&s;elf, that tells him this truth, he is con&s;tructively told likewi&s;e the con&s;equence from it, namely, that he is cur&s;ed by the law. And if the law cur&s;es him, it cannot ju&s;tifie him; if it convicts him of &s;in, it can't ac|quit him from guilt; if it condemns him as a tran&s;gre&s;&s;or, it can't vindicate him as a righteous per&s;on.</P>
<P>THE Apo&s;tle again argues, that we can't be "ju&s;tified by the law", or any works done in o|bedience to it, becau&s;e "by the law is the know|ledge of &s;in" <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.20.</NOTE> The law &s;ets before men's view, in a le&s;s or greater degree of light, what God
<PB N="14" REF="009925_0019_0F7B394E814AC3C8">
commands, and what he forbids; and every man, by comparing him&s;elf with the law, may know, and can't but know, that he has been a tran&s;|gre&s;&s;or of it, either by omitting what it required, or by commiting what it prohibited. Even tho&s;e, who have no law but that which is "written on their hearts", may know, if it be not their own fault, "that they have done tho&s;e things which are worthy of death". Much more is this the truth in regard of tho&s;e, who, in addition to this "natural law", have had the law "revealed to them from heaven". By this clearer di&s;covery of what is duty, and what is tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, they may be more fully convinced in their con&s;ciences that they are &s;inners in the eye of the law. And if they know by the law that they are &s;inners, they mu&s;t know al&s;o that, being &s;uch, they are by the law incapable of ju&s;tification. To &s;uppo&s;e that any man could be accounted and declared ju&s;t by that law, in the e&s;timation of which he is a &s;inner, is highly ab&s;urd. As certainly therefore as every man knows, or may know, by the law, that he is an offender, &s;o certainly does he know, or may know, that by the law it would be utterly vain to expect a vindication as righteous.</P>
<P>THE Apo&s;tle yet further argues again&s;t our be|ing ju&s;tified by the works of the law, from the ab&s;urd con&s;equences that would follow from &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ition: Two of which I &s;hall particularly mention; and the rather, as they are matters of &s;erious and great importance.</P>
<P>ONE is, that we &s;hould not be indebted to grace, if we were ju&s;tified by works. For "to
<PB N="15" REF="009925_0020_0F7B394F42C37948">
him that worketh", &s;o as to be entitled to ju&s;tifica|tion on the &s;core of his works, "the reward would be reckoned, not of grace, but of debt". <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. 4.4.</NOTE> And is this the &s;cripture-way of men's being ju&s;tified? No; &s;ays the apo&s;tle, "we are ju&s;tified freely by God's grace". <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. 4.24.</NOTE> And "if by grace, then not by works". <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 27, 28. Chap. 11.6.</NOTE> And of &s;uch con&s;equence is it, in the judgment of this apo&s;tle, that we &s;hould depend upon "grace", and not upon "works", in the affair of ju&s;tification, that he declares to the Ga|latians, <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Chap. 5.4.</NOTE> "Who&s;oever of you are ju&s;tified by the law, ye are fallen from grace". Ju&s;tification up|on a plea grounded on works done in obedience to the law, and ju&s;tification upon the foot of grace, the free favor of God, are &s;ubver&s;ive of each o|ther: In&s;omuch that if we are ju&s;tified by works, we cannot be ju&s;tified by grace; and if we are ju&s;tified by grace, we cannot be ju&s;tified by works.</P>
<P>THE other con&s;equence of our being ju&s;tified by works is, the di&s;honor it reflects on Chri&s;t. It renders his mediatorial interpo&s;ition a needle&s;s thing, counter-acts the de&s;ign of his coming into the world, and nullifies his death; making it of little or no importance in the bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;alvati|on. To this purpo&s;e the apo&s;tle rea&s;ons, <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Gal. 3.21.</NOTE> "If righteou&s;ne&s;s comes by the law, then Chri&s;t is dead in vain". Agreably whereto he again ar|gues, <NOTE N="&sect;&sect;" PLACE="foot">Rom. 4.14.</NOTE> "If they which are of the law are heirs, faith is made void, and the promi&s;e made of no effect". As if he had &s;aid, if they that will be ju&s;tified by works in obedience to the law, may
<PB N="16" REF="009925_0021_0F7B394FFB202F48">
obtain the heavenly inheritance, then faith in Chri&s;t as the end of the law for righteou&s;ne&s;s is needle&s;s, and the promi&s;e by grace thro' him is bro't to nought.</P>
<P>THESE are the genuine con&s;equences of the doctrine of ju&s;tification upon the terms of law, if we may tru&s;t to the rea&s;oning of the apo&s;tle Paul. And it was upon this account, principally, that he was &s;o frequent and zealous in his oppo&s;ition to it. He had been made to feel the ab&s;olute in|&s;ufficiency of law and works in the great affair of the &s;inner's ju&s;tification, and knew that it could be effected in no way but that "of grace thro' Chri&s;t". This therefore was the way he carefully pointed out both to Jews and Gentiles, that is, to mankind univer&s;ally. And he was abundant in his labors relative hereto; particularly in tak|ing men off from their dependance on the law, as knowing that, if they &s;ought to be ju&s;tified on the &s;core of their works in conformity to it, they would fru&s;trate the grace of God, and render the whole work of Chri&s;t a thing needle&s;s, and to no purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I HAVE now &s;aid what may be tho't &s;ufficient, without any further enlargement, to make it evi|dent, beyond all rea&s;onable di&s;pute, that "no fle&s;h", no man, "can be ju&s;tified by the works of the law".</P>
<P>BEFORE I proceed to make what has been di&s;cour&s;ed practically u&s;eful, I would interpo&s;e a remark, which I e&s;teem an important one. It is
<PB N="17" REF="009925_0022_0F7B395105F2A0F8">
this. The apo&s;tle Paul no where &s;ugge&s;ts, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tis true, he brings in Mo&s;es thus de&s;cribing the righ|teou&s;ne&s;s which is of the law, "the man that doth the&s;e things &s;hall live by them", Rom. 10.5. He does the &s;ame, Gal. 3.12. "the man that doth them &s;hall live in them". It may &s;eem, at fir&s;t &s;ight, as tho' the apo&s;tle &s;uppo&s;ed, in the&s;e texts, that the Jews might live upon the terms of their law, as a covenant of works; and that it was given them by God to this end. And in this &s;en&s;e he has &s;ometimes been inter|preted. The great Mr. Lock thus explains him, in his note upon Rom. 5.20. But we &s;hould make him flatly contradict him&s;elf, &s;hould we under&s;tand him as intending to &s;ay, that life might be obtained by the Mo&s;aic law, meerly as &s;uch. For he expre&s;ly declares, Rom. 4.13, 14. "that the promi&s;e was not to Abraham, or to his &s;eed, thro' the law, but thro' the righteou&s;|ne&s;s of faith. For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promi&s;e made of none effect". To the &s;ame purpo&s;e he teaches us, Gal. 2. ult, "if righteou&s;ne&s;s comes by the law, Chri&s;t is dead in vain". When therefore he &s;ays, in a way of rea&s;oning, "the man that doth them &s;hall live in them", he is to be con&s;idered as arguing with the Jews upon their own principles. Their law, as they inter|preted it, promi&s;ed life, life beyond the grave, eternal life in heaven, upon the SOLE CONSIDERATION of their obedience to it. The apo&s;tle, from this con|&s;truction which they, not he, put upon the Mo&s;aic law, points out to them the impo&s;&s;ibility of their obtaining life, by oppo&s;ing the cur&s;e to the promi&s;e, "cur&s;ed is every one that continueth not in all things written in book of the law to do them". It will be found, I be|lieve, upon the clo&s;e&s;t examination, a difficult, if not impo&s;&s;ible ta&s;k, to make this apo&s;tle a con&s;i&s;tent cohe|rent writer, upon any other &s;cheme of interpretation. I &s;hall add here, there is a &s;en&s;e, in which the words, "the man that doth them &s;hall live in them", is &s;trict|ly true; and this is, by viewing the law in its "&s;pirit", and not according to the "letter"; that is, as refering to the promi&s;e revealed to Adam, and afterwards re|peated to Abraham, and connected, in the divine intention, "with the gift thro' Chri&s;t". A man, in this &s;en&s;e of the law, might "live" in con&s;equence of his obedience to it; tho' tis impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould con|&s;idering it as naked "law". And this, in fact, was the way in which the pious Jews, all along under the Mo&s;aic di&s;pen&s;ation, obtained life. And, interpreting the law in this &s;en&s;e, that is, con&s;idering it in con|nection with grace and Chri&s;t, Mo&s;es and Ezekiel might with truth &s;ay to the Jews, "ye &s;hall keep my &s;tatutes, which if a man do he &s;hall live in them"; tho', perhaps, &s;uch declarations refer, not to "eternal life", but that "temporal one in Canaan", which, by a national covenant, was promi&s;ed to the Jews, and could be enjoyed by them, only upon the foot of their obedience.</NOTE> that meer law, law &s;eperated from grace and Chri&s;t, was
<PB N="18" REF="009925_0023_0F7B39517AAA1100">
ever &s;ince the lap&s;e, whatever it might be before,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Po&s;&s;ibly, the rule of tryal the fir&s;t father of men was under, in his innocent &s;tate, was a "covenant of grace, revealed by Chri&s;t", then in "the form of God", tho' when he appeared in our world, it was "in fa&s;hion as a man". Perhaps al&s;o, "faith in Chri&s;t", the re|vealer of this law of tryal, was the only &s;pring of con|duct upon which the life promi&s;ed could be obtained. But however this might be, which I only mention en pa&s;&s;ant, thus much &s;eems plain, that the original promi&s;e of life was not &s;u&s;pended upon "perfect obe|dience" to what is commonly called "the natural or moral law of God". In contradiction hereto, I know, tis &s;aid by mo&s;t chri&s;tian writers, that the fir&s;t man was &s;o placed under this law, as that he mu&s;t work his way to life by perfectly doing all things commanded by it; in&s;omuch that he could not have obtained it, but by per&s;evering obedience in every point of duty, without the lea&s;t failure. But this is &s;aid intirely with|out book. The &s;cripture no where in&s;inuates, that he was under "&s;uch a covenant of works". It &s;ugge&s;ts, on the contrary, that God, in favor to him, did not put him upon &s;o &s;evere a tryal for life. His tryal, if we may believe the &s;acred record of it, was in a "&s;in|gle in&s;tance", and this, not of doing, but of forbear|ing to do. Life and death were &s;u&s;pended upon his regard or di&s;regard to a <HI>divine re&s;traint</HI> laid upon him in one article only. This is the account the in&s;pired Mo&s;es has given of the matter; and he has done it in words too plain and expre&s;s to need any comment, or to admit of di&s;pute. Read Gen. 2.16, 17. Tis ob|&s;ervable, that which was made the te&s;t of Adam's &s;ub|jection to God, was a command, not of the moral, but po&s;itive kind; a command, not deducible from rea&s;on, but knowable only by revelation from heaven. It could not therefore be obeyed but from FAITH IN GOD, the revealer. Upon which it may, with all freedom, be affirmed, that our fir&s;t father, while innocent, as really as any of his po&s;terity, tho' not in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e, was to LIVE BY FAITH. And it was owing to his UN|BELIEF, however this was effected, that he "eat of the tree", concerning which God had &s;aid, "thou &s;halt not eat of it", thereupon incuring the threatned penalty "thou &s;hall &s;urely die". If Adam, from <HI>faith</HI> in the divine revelation, which put him upon a tryal for life, had ab&s;tained from eating of "the forbidden tree", he would, without all doubt, have had God for his in|&s;tructor, guide, and con&s;tant a&s;&s;i&s;tant, &s;o as that he would, in all in&s;tances, have obeyed "the natural moral law" as perfectly as one, of &s;o low an order in the &s;cale of being, can be &s;uppo&s;ed to have done. But his "thus obeying" was not the tryal God put him to f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> life, but a &s;pecial one by immediate revelation, in which FAITH was the only governing principle that could have &s;ecur'd him from death. It would be the exact truth, &s;hould I &s;ay, that the fir&s;t parents of men, while innocent, in common with their po&s;terity &s;ince the lap&s;e, could have obtained life in no way but that "of grace thro' faith". It is readily own'd, as the po&s;terity of the fir&s;t pair, in con&s;equence of the lap&s;e, are under a &s;entence which has doom'd them to death, there mu&s;t be the di&s;covery of "abounding grace" in delivering them from death, that they may live; and, as the life open'd to their view is not life in an earthly paradi&s;e, but in God's eternal kingdom, by a re&s;urrection that will make them incorrup<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ble and immortal, there mu&s;t be the di&s;play of "&s;uper-abounding grace": e&s;pe|cially, as this life is obtainable, notwith&s;tanding the "many offences", however aggravated, they may have been guilty of in their own per&s;ons. It is acknow|ledged al&s;o, that the "object" of their faith is differ|ent. They mu&s;t believe in God as "reconcilable to &s;inners thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t", and as "reconciling them to him&s;elf not imputing to them their tre&s;pa&s;&s;es". But &s;till, it was grace in God to man, while in his inno|cent &s;tate, to make the promi&s;e of life; and faith in God, as the revealer of this promi&s;e, was that alone upon the foot of which he could have obtained this ble&s;&s;ing. It may be worth remarking here, "the co|venant of works" contra&s;ted, in the &s;acred books, with "the covenant of grace", is not any covenant of works God ever made with Adam; but "the Sinai-cove|nant" made with the Jewi&s;h nation. This is accord|ingly the covenant always meant, when we read of the "old covenant", the "fir&s;t covenant", in oppo&s;i|tion to the "new covenant", the "&s;econd covenant", which ought to be heedfully minded in reading the &s;criptures; particularly the epi&s;tle to the Hebrews&punc;</NOTE> a divinely con&s;tituted method for the obtainment of life; or that life could be obtained upon the foot of law, in this &s;en&s;e, by any works done in

conformity to it, whether perfect, or imperfect. Far from &s;aying thus, he declares, with great pe|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">emptorine&s;s, that the &s;uppo&s;ition of coming to life by bare law would totally fru&s;trate the grace

of God, and nullifie the death of Chri&s;t. The ca&s;e was plainly this. The Jews, in his day, had e&s;&s;entially corrupted the Mo&s;aic law in their u&s;e of it with reference to eternal life. They con|&s;idered it as a "covenant of works", depending on
<PB N="21" REF="009925_0026_0F7B395545A78A50">
their legal ob&s;ervances, meerly as &s;uch, for a title to life. It was this fundamental mi&s;take of their's that gave ri&s;e to a great part of this Apo&s;tle's epi&s;tles to the Romans, and the Galatians; in which he labors to take them off from this u&s;e of the law, by &s;hewing the impo&s;&s;ibility of their ever being ju&s;tified in this way. And he &s;o manages his argument, as to make it equally conclu&s;ive, whether applied to Jews, or Gentiles. His rea|&s;oning, in its real force, and ju&s;t con&s;equence, ex|tends univer&s;ally; leaving every &s;on of Adam de&s;titute of any claim to life, as grounded on law only, or any works done in conformity to it. It was to illu&s;trate this grand point, (which may be worthy of our &s;pecial notice) that he introduces what he &s;ays upon the lap&s;e by the "one man" Adam, with it's con&s;equences relative to all his po&s;terity. And it gives his argument a mo&s;t &s;triking force. For if both Jews and Gentiles, mankind univer&s;ally, are &s;ubjected to "death" by means of the original lap&s;e, and, in con&s;equence of this &s;ubjection, are in &s;uch a &s;tate, as that they will certainly commit &s;in in violation of the law, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Subjection to death, and <HI>upon this</HI> &s;uch a liablene&s;s to commit &s;in, as is incon&s;i&s;tent with the obtainment of life by law, without grace and Chri&s;t, are the TWO GRAND THO'TS, the Apo&s;tle would communicate by tho&s;e words, Rom. 5.12. "Wherefore, as by one man &s;in entered into the world, and death by &s;in, and &s;o death pa&s;&s;ed upon all men, for that all have &s;inned". The lap&s;e of the "one man" Adam is here evidently repre&s;ented as the original &s;ource both of SIN and DEATH. The Apo&s;tle not only affirms, that "death", in con&s;equence of this lap&s;e, "pa&s;&s;ed upon all men", but that "all have &s;inned"; &s;peaking of that which certainly will be, as tho' it actually was: a mode of diction not unu&s;ual in the &s;cripture. So tis &s;aid concerning our Saviour, Heb. 2.8. "Thou ha&s;t put all things in &s;ubjection under his feet"; tho' it follows, in the latter part of the &s;ame ver&s;e, "we &s;ee not yet all things put under him". In like manner, tis here declared concerning the whole human race, tho' va&s;t multitudes of this race had not then come into exi&s;tence, that "death pa&s;&s;ed upon them", and that they "have all &s;inned". And tis with real truth the apo&s;tle thus &s;peaks, becau&s;e, in con&s;equence of the lap&s;e, both "death" and "&s;in", &s;in as well as death, will be certain fact with re&s;pect to them all. They will all; after they have been in being, fall by the &s;troke of death; and they will all as certainly, when they become capable of moral action, become charge|able with &s;in, &s;o as to be beyond the po&s;&s;ibility of ju&s;ti|cation upon the foot of law. Tis accordingly ob|&s;ervable, mankind, judging of their character by meer law, are ever con&s;idered by this apo&s;tle as "&s;inners". Hence that univer&s;al affirmation, Rom. 3.9. "all are under &s;in". And again, ver. 19. "all the world are become guilty before God". And yet again, ver. 23. "all have &s;inned". The apo&s;tle means preci&s;ely the &s;ame thing in the above-cited words, that he does in the pa&s;&s;age we are upon, "all have &s;inned". Only, he goes further here, and lets us into the true ri&s;e, the occa&s;ional cau&s;e, of this univer&s;al defection, namely, the lap&s;e of the "one man" Adam. But then, it &s;hould always be particularly minded, as "&s;in" and "death" are e&s;&s;entially different, the one being a na|tural, the other a moral evil, this lap&s;e of the fir&s;t man is to be con&s;idered as the &s;ource of the&s;e evils in differ|ent ways, corre&s;ponding to the difference in their na|tures. And this leads me to exhibit a ver&s;ion of the latter clau&s;e of this 12th ver. which, &s;hould it be new, may notwith&s;tanding &s;erve to convey clear and ju&s;t &s;entiments concerning this important matter. I would read the ver&s;e (droping its comparative form, that I may the more ea&s;ily be under&s;tood) after the following manner, "by one man &s;in entered into the world, and death by &s;in, and &s;o death pa&s;&s;ed upon all men, (<GAP DESC="foreign">) UPON WHICH all have &s;inned". As if the apo&s;tle had &s;aid, by the "one man" Adam, &s;in entered into the world, and death by his &s;in in eating of the forbidden tree; and thus, by this one offence of this one man, death, in the &s;en&s;e Mo&s;es has given of it, hath come upon all men, WHEREUPON, UPON WHICH, IN CON|SEQUENCE OF WHICH they have all &s;inned, &s;peaking of that which certainly will be, as tho' it now was. The apo&s;tle had it in his view, as I imagine, not only to repre&s;ent "death" and "&s;in", with re&s;pect to the whole human race, as taking ri&s;e from the lap&s;e of the one man Adam, but to &s;ugge&s;t the different ways in which this is done. The judicial &s;entence of God, occa&s;ioned by the one offence of this one man, is that which fa&s;tens "death", with all its natural cau&s;es and appendages, upon the human kind; and tis IN CON|SEQUENCE of this &s;entence, UPON men's coming into exi&s;tence under the di&s;advantages ari&s;ing from it, that they "&s;in" them&s;elves. Tis ob&s;ervable, the apo&s;tle having &s;aid, "by one man &s;in entered into the world, and death by &s;in", this &s;in of his, does not go on to &s;ay, "and &s;o death and &s;in have pa&s;&s;ed upon all men"; but "death", in this way, "pa&s;&s;ed upon all men", <GAP DESC="foreign">, UPON WHICH, IN CONSEQUENCE OF WHICH, they have &s;inned them&s;elves. It is with great exact|ne&s;s the apo&s;tle has here expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf. And he purpo&s;ely did it, as I conceive of the matter, to carry our tho'ts up to Adam as the true original &s;ource of SIN as well as DEATH; and to give us to under&s;tand, at the &s;ame time, that he is the &s;ource of the&s;e evils in different ways: Of "death", by the &s;entence of God, taking ri&s;e from the one offence of this one man; and of "&s;in", UPON or IN CONSEQUENCE of this, by rea|&s;on of that frail, mortal, unhappy &s;tate, to which we are &s;ubjected in this world of vanity, toil and &s;orrow. It would be ea&s;y to point out the way in which mankind become "&s;inners" UPON, or IN CONSEQUENCE OF, their &s;ubjection to death thro' the lap&s;e of their fir&s;t father, and to do this under the guidance of the Apo&s;tle Paul, who&s;e MODE OF DICTION, in numerous pa&s;&s;ages in his epi&s;tles, is emphatical upon the above interpre|tation of his words, but &s;carce intelligible upon any other &s;uppo&s;ition;&mdash;but to &s;ay any thing upon the&s;e points would oblige me to digre&s;s too far. I &s;hall only add, the prepo&s;ition, <GAP DESC="foreign">, joined with a dative ca&s;e, is &s;carce ever u&s;ed, in the new-te&s;tament, but in the &s;en&s;e I have given it.

Nor is it an ob|jection of any weight, that I don't make the relative <GAP DESC="foreign">, in my way of con&s;truction, to agree with either of the foregoing &s;ub&s;tantives, but take for its antecedent the immediately foregoing &s;entence.

And tis remarkable, the phra&s;e, <GAP DESC="foreign">, is u&s;ed by the Apo&s;tle Paul in three places be&s;ides this we have been illu&s;trating; and, in all of them, the prepo&s;ition, <GAP DESC="foreign">, has the &s;ame meaning I have given it here: And, what may be worthy of &s;pecial notice, the relative, <GAP DESC="foreign">, grammatically agrees, not with a preceding &s;ub&s;tan|tive, but &s;entence. The places I refer to, as in the original language, not in the engli&s;h tran&s;lation, are 2 Cor. 5.4 Philip. 3.12. and 4.10.

it is from hence demon&s;trable, that the doctrine of ju&s;tification, upon the foot of law, in oppo&s;iti|to grace and Chri&s;t, is an imaginary notion only. The great point in view with this Apo&s;tle was, to di&s;engage &s;inners from "working for life", as

And, in truth, had not the father of mercies intended to have dealt with the po&s;terity of Adam in a way of grace, or go&s;pel, he would not, I believe, have &s;uffered them to come into being&punc; He would rather have pre|vented this, by the execution of death upon the fir&s;t man, &s;o &s;oon after his lap&s;e as to have left no room for his having po&s;terity.

The Apo&s;tle Paul certainly viewed the matter in this light.

Tis nothing but the interpo&s;i|tion of grace can deliver them from the power of the grave. And as they &s;hall be thus delivered, and this univer&s;ally, tis as certain that they are herein dealt with upon the foot of grace, as that death pa&s;&s;es upon them, <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">If any &s;hould object and &s;ay, a re&s;urrection from the dead is no argument of grace in God, becau&s;e it will be, to many, "a re&s;urrection to damnation, and not &s;alvation"; the an&s;wer is obvious: Is it no favor to live under the light of the go&s;pel, rather than in pagan darkne&s;s, &s;ince many, thro' their abu&s;e of the go&s;pel, will be the more mi&s;erable in another world?

<P>THIS view of the &s;tate of Adam's po&s;terity at once cuts off all occa&s;ion for murmuring and complaint, tho' our condition is &s;uch, that if law &s;hould be the rule of our tryal, we mu&s;t unavoid|ably fall under a &s;entence of condemnation. For we may be "&s;aved by grace thro' Chri&s;t", tho' &s;al|vation is impo&s;&s;ible upon the foot of law. Shall we then any of us be &s;o unadvi&s;ed, as to &s;eek to be ju&s;tified by works done in conformity to the law? This has all along been the great folly of mankind. Tho' con&s;cious to them&s;elves that they are &s;inners, it has been their way to betake them|&s;elves to doings of their own, in one form or a|nother, to procure the favor of God, and their acceptance as righteous in his &s;ight. Tis &s;aid of the Jews, in the days of the Apo&s;tles, who "fol|lowed after the law of righteou&s;ne&s;s", that they "attained not to the law of righteou&s;ne&s;s". And why? The rea&s;on follows, "becau&s;e they &s;ought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law". <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. 9.31, 32.</NOTE> And it may, with equal truth, be &s;aid of mo&s;t chri&s;tians &s;o called, that neither have they "attained to a ju&s;tifying righteou&s;ne&s;s"; and for the like rea&s;on, "becau&s;e they have &s;ought for it in virtue of the deeds they have done in imagined conformity to the law." Law, as we have heard, is rigidly &s;evere; making no abate|ment, admitting of no excu&s;es, and &s;hewing no mercy. The man that fails in his compliance with its demands, tho' it &s;hould be in one article

only, in&s;tantly comes under condemnation. We can't therefore take a more effectual method to fa&s;ten ruin upon our&s;elves, than by &s;eeking to obtain deliverance from it upon the terms of law. Our ca&s;e indeed is ab&s;olutely de&s;perate, while law, or any works we have done in obedience to it, is what we depend upon for an acquitance in judg|ment. No &s;on of Adam, in any age, in any place, or under any di&s;pen&s;ation of God, was ever ju&s;ti|fied in this way, or could have been For, in the eye of law, "the whole world is guilty before God".

Surely, we have no cau&s;e of pride on account of our works of righteou&s;ne&s;s. They have been at|tended with &s;o much frailty and imperfection, even the be&s;t of them, that if God &s;hould examine them with rigor, we could not &s;tand &s;o &s;evere a tryal. Let us, with the Apo&s;tle Paul, "count all things but lo&s;s for the excellency of the know|ledge of Chri&s;t Je&s;us our Lord"; yea, let us "count them but dung that we may win Chri&s;t, and be found in him, not having our own righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, which is of the law; but that which is thro' the faith of Chri&s;t, the righteou&s;ne&s;s which is of God by faith". And we may now, upon a ju&s;t foundation, hope for acceptance with God here, and an acquitance at the bar of judgment hereafter; to be pronounced ble&s;&s;ed, and to be bid to enter into the joy of our Lord, which God grant, &amp;c.</P>

<P>IF it is impo&s;&s;ible, that any of the human race &s;hould be "ju&s;tified by the works of the law", as the Apo&s;tle Paul affirms in my text, and as we have abundantly proved in a former di&s;|cour&s;e from it, it may naturally be enquired,</P>
<P>WHY then was the law introduced among the Jews? What was the &s;pecial view of God in re|vealing it to them from Sinai, in the days of Mo&s;es? Nor may this be e&s;teemed a que&s;tion of trivial importance. The apo&s;tle Paul, having di&s;cour&s;ed to the Galatians upon the unatainable|ne&s;s

As if he had &s;aid, if it be true, as I have been proving it to be, that the Jews could not be acquited as righteous per&s;ons upon the &s;core of works done in obedience to the law, it may, with great pertinency, be a&s;kt, why was the law given to them? Why did God, in &s;o &s;olemn a manner, promulge it from heaven, and put them under the obligations of it? To this important que&s;tion the apo&s;tle has given a direct and po&s;itive an&s;wer. But, before I come to men|tion his an&s;wer, and dilate upon it &s;o as to make it ea&s;y and familiar, I would previou&s;ly remark,</P>
<P>THAT the po&s;terity of Abraham, 430 years before the giving of the law, were put, by God him&s;elf, into the way of "ju&s;tification without law", or in other words, upon the foot of "grace thro' the promi&s;ed &s;eed". This was the main thing intended, when he repeatedly &s;aid to Abra|ham, "I will be your God, and the God of your &s;eed. In thee &s;hall all nations of the earth be ble&s;&s;ed". The "go&s;pel" was now &s;ummarily preached to Abraham, as it had been before to Adam; that &s;ame go&s;pel which has &s;ince been particularly explained in the writings of the new-te&s;tament. And the "mercy" hereby promi&s;ed to him lay at the bottom, as the true and great ba&s;is of the whole &s;cheme of the divine conduct with reference to the jewi&s;h nation.

their fault in the days of the apo&s;tles: For which rea&s;on, even tho&s;e among them who pro|fe&s;&s;ed faith in Chri&s;t, contended earne&s;tly for an ad|herence to the law, as what was nece&s;&s;ary in order to their obtaining the favor of God. But they were herein egregiou&s;ly mi&s;taken. And it was this mi&s;take of their's that gave occa&s;ion for numerous pa&s;&s;ages in Paul's epi&s;tles, from which it may with certainty be collected, that ju&s;tification was ob|tainable even while the law &s;ub&s;i&s;ted. But how? Not "thro' the law", but in virtue of "the pro|mi&s;e founded in Chri&s;t", with which it was con|nected in the view of God. To this purpo&s;e he argues, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. 4.13.</NOTE> "The promi&s;e was not to Abraham, or to his &s;eed, thro' the law, but thro' the righte|ou&s;ne&s;s of faith". That is to &s;ay, the promi&s;ed grant of life was not made upon "terms of law", but in quite another method here &s;ignified by "the righteou&s;ne&s;s of faith". He adds, in the words that immediately follow, "if they which are of the law are heirs, faith is made void, and the promi&s;e made of no effect".

Tis abundant|ly evident from the&s;e texts, that "the ju&s;tification of life", tho' unattainable by the law, was yet at|tainable under the law, in virtue of the abrahamic covenant, which it neither did, nor could, &s;et a|&s;ide. It is evident al&s;o, that it was not the in|tention of the law to fru&s;trate, or, in any mea&s;ure, oppo&s;e, the operation of the promi&s;e, but that it was rather de&s;igned to promote it by its actings in &s;ub&s;erviency to it.</P>
<P>IT may, I think, be ju&s;tly collected from what has been thus previou&s;ly remarked, that the "Mo&s;aic law", meerly as &s;uch, was not intended by God as a "covenant of life". His view here|in was not to let the Jews, or any of the race of men, know, that perfect innocency was the way in which they were to obtain the favor of God to eternal life; or that, unle&s;s they were thus inno|cent, they &s;hould be "ca&s;t into pri&s;on till they had paid the utmo&s;t farthing". Had this been the de&s;ign of God in publi&s;hing his law from Sinai, it would have been ab&s;olutely incon&s;i&s;tent, not only with his promi&s;e to Abraham, "I will be your God, and the God of your &s;eed"; but with that more ancient one to the fir&s;t father of men,

"the &s;eed of the woman &s;hall brui&s;e the &s;erpent's head". The law of God, it is true, being a per|fect rule of righteou&s;ne&s;s, always did, and always mu&s;t, require perfect innocency. And God's &s;et|ting it before the world, as he does in the pro|mulgation of it, may powerfully tend to lead them into ju&s;t apprehen&s;ions of their duty, and convince them from thence of their unhappy condition, &s;hould they be dealt with according to the re|quirements of law: But it could not be de&s;igned to let them know, that they could find acceptance with heaven in no way but by "perfectly" keep|ing the law.

<P>AN obvious corollary now pre&s;ents it&s;elf. It is this. That &s;inners ought not to be told, that they mu&s;t be "perfect", <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This is what the author of the "letters on Theron and A&s;pa&s;io" tells tho&s;e, who, while de&s;titute of "the &s;alutary truth", would do any thing that they might obtain life. "If they attempt to do <HI>in any &s;en&s;e,</HI> they bind them&s;elves to do all". The requirement of them is, "<HI>every thing,</HI> or <HI>nothing</HI>", pag. 285. He accord|ingly &s;ums up what they have to do in the&s;e words, pag. 387. "Be perfect, keep the commandments, and thou &s;halt live. The obligation of the law is eternal, &s;o can never be loo&s;ed". If the "obligation of the law is thus indi&s;&s;oluble", why does he &s;peak of him|&s;elf, pag. 10. "as ready to &s;hew, that all objections and impediments have been, by a <HI>particular divine edict</HI> for the purpo&s;e, removed and di&s;pen&s;ed with in favor of all, who are &s;incerely di&s;po&s;ed, whenever they &s;hall be found"? Why does he bring in the ble&s;&s;ed God, pag. 90.
<Q>a&s;&s;uring every man, who &s;hall &s;incerely re|pent, or turn from his evil way, and do that which is lawful and right, that he &s;hall be happy [that is, as he means here, in the <HI>&s;ole virtue</HI> of his repentance and righteou&s;ne&s;s, without any view to Chri&s;t] and no mention made of his former faults; and con|firming all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">his by his oath, that there might be no remaining doubt or he&s;itation in the minds of men, about their acceptance with God, as &s;oon as they are reformed</Q>?
If our author can reconcile "this particular edict", and "a&s;&s;urance from the God of truth", with a "law-obligation that is eternally in|di&s;&s;oluble", he may claim the honor of doing that which no man has ever yet done, that is, of making both parts of a contradiction true. Be&s;ides, if the law requires perfect <HI>per&s;onal</HI> obedience, and "its obligation can never be loo&s;ed", how came Chri&s;t to be admitted to do &amp; &s;uffer in the &s;inner's &s;tead? This principle &s;trict|ly adhered to, will nullifie the whole &s;cheme of grace thro' Chri&s;t. It is indeed a flat contradiction to the revealed character of God. But to pa&s;s the&s;e things. If one &s;hould put the que&s;tion to our author, what law of heaven ever required men perfectly to keep the commandments IN ORDER TO LIFE? he would, per|haps, find him&s;elf greatly puzzled to give a ju&s;t an&s;wer. Was it the law man was placed under in paradi&s;e? Tis as evident as words can make it, that life, even in man's innocent &s;tate, was a matter of grace, and &s;u&s;pended upon a &s;ingle article of forbearing to do; and this, from a principle of faith in a revelation from God. See a preceding note, pag. 18, 19, 20.&mdash;Was it a law given to man immediately after the lap&s;e? The all-merciful God, even before he pronounced the &s;entence, dooming man to death, &s;ummarily revealed "the grand &s;alutary truth", by promi&s;ing, that "the &s;eed of the woman &s;hould brui&s;e the &s;erpent's head". And by promulging this promi&s;e, a con&s;titution of grace was erected, conformably to which eternal life became obtainable by Adam, and all his po&s;terity. How? Not by "perfectly doing"; but by "believ|ing in the &s;eed God had promi&s;ed". And as this method of grace was e&s;tabli&s;ht immediately upon the lap&s;e, it has all along been, now is, and always will be, the one only way to life for &s;inful man.&mdash;Was it the law publi&s;hed from Sinai? If we con&s;ider this law as a "national covenant", containing the terms upon which the Jews &s;hould hold the land of Canaan, and live in the quiet happy po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, no other people had any concern with it. Tho' it ought to remem|bered here, this law, &s;o far as its precepts were of a moral nature, being founded in rea&s;on, and not po&s;i|tive injunction, was obligatory upon all others as a rule of duty, wherein they might come to the knowledge of it. It ought al&s;o to be very heedfully minded, this political law, or national covenant, was &s;o con&s;tructed as to be, in the de&s;ign of God, a figure, type, or em|blematical repre&s;entation of that GOSPEL, which had been preached to Abraham, and has &s;ince been preach|ed to all the world, and is the only foundation upon which eternal life is obtainable. God has promi&s;ed it in no other way; and to go to work for it in any other way, whether by perfect or imperfect obedience, no matter which, would be, virtually and in reality of &s;en&s;e, to &s;et up a method for obtaining life in direct oppo&s;ition to that, which God has already e&s;tabli&s;hed. This was the great fault of the Jews, particularly in the times of Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles. They intirely mi&s;took the "true &s;pirit" of their law, as it related to eternal life. In their ob&s;ervance of it, they regarded the "letter only", overlooking its ultimate intention, which was its very "life and &s;oul". It accordingly became "a mini&s;tration of death" to them, and not "of life". And why? Not becau&s;e they did not per|fectly obey it; for if they had, according to "the letter", it would &s;till have been "the mini&s;tration of condemnation", becau&s;e their obedience would have been without "&s;pirit", that is, it would have been o|bedience detached from "go&s;pel", which was the "life and &s;pirit" of the law. No perfection, could we &s;up|po&s;e it angelic, &s;eparate from grace and Chri&s;t, could have given a Jew a ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e to life, becau&s;e that God, who&s;e gift it is, had not promi&s;ed it in that way.&mdash; There is no law now left that can require "perfect doing" IN ORDER TO LIFE, unle&s;s it be that which is commonly called, "the law of nature". But what law is this? Is it a law naturally imprinted on men's minds, which tells them, either directly, or by the ex|erci&s;e of the powers they are endowed with, what God's requirements are, at the &s;ame time ASSURING them, that, upon their compliance with them, they &s;hall LIVE FOREVER? Nothing is more certain, than &s;uch a law of nature never exi&s;ted but in imagination only.&mdash;Is this law that rule of right, which God knows to be the mea&s;ure of men's duty to him, and of what it is fit he &s;hould do for, or inflict upon, them, as they are either obedient, or di&s;obedient? There is, without all doubt, &s;uch a rule of men's duty towards God, and of God's conduct towards men in a way of reward, or puni&s;hment, according to their works. But yet, none of the &s;ons of Adam, by the mere exerci&s;e of their natural powers, ever yet attained to a perfect knowledge of this rule. Mo&s;t certainly, they are unable, after all their rea&s;onings, to &s;ay, what puni&s;hment, as to kind, or degree, or duration, would be their due in ca&s;e of &s;in, or what reward it would be proper for God to be&s;tow upon them in ca&s;e of obedience. God alone is ab&s;olutely &amp; fully acquainted with "this rule of right"; and we can be clearly and certainly acquainted with it only by revelation from him. And &s;uch revelation man has all along, from the beginning, in his innocent and lap&s;ed &s;tate, been favored with. This revealed law therefore is the only one we have any concern with AS THE WAY TO ETERNAL LIFE. In &s;hort, whatever law of nature be &s;uppo&s;ed, tis &s;uper&s;eded by revelation; which is the "only rule" God will ob&s;erve in the be&s;towment of life after death. And yet, our author, in&s;tead of di|recting men to exert them&s;elves, in the u&s;e of means, to obtain that "faith" in the revelation of God, with|out which tis impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould inherit life, points their endeavours another way, boldly telling them, if they will do any thing, they mu&s;t "be perfect". And why? Becau&s;e truly this they are obliged to by a &s;up|po&s;ed "law of nature, who&s;e obligation is eternal, and cannot be loo&s;ed". Tis upon this fond conceit of his, that he has, with &s;o much prophane levity, per|verted the &s;en&s;e of a great part of the bible; making the calls of God, which are all founded on the plan of grace thro' Chri&s;t, not calls of mercy, but to obey "his imaginary law"; hereby turning the grace of God, in reality of con&s;truction, into a wanton in&s;ult on his poor &s;inful creatures.</P>

If the calls, in the&s;e chapters, to "turn from their evil ways", and to "do that which is ju&s;t and right", are interpreted, as they ought to be, as &s;o many exhortations, upon the plan of grace thro' the promi&s;ed &s;eed, they would be at once intelli|gible in them&s;elves, and con&s;i&s;tent with the common language of the bible, and the grand &s;cheme the father of mercies has had in pro&s;ecution from the beginning of the world. But to explain them, as this author does, as commands, a compliance with which would, in its own virtue, give a claim to life; and to bring in the holy God &s;wearing to the truth of it, is at once to abu&s;e the &s;cripture, and impeach the divine veracity and purity. Will that God, who is as ju&s;t as he is good, admit &s;inners to his favor upon the <HI>&s;ole con&s;ideration,</HI> either of obedience or repentance, perfect or imperfect? What an a&s;pect has this upon the great atonement by the blood of Chri&s;t? How will it con&s;i&s;t with the character, under which God has all along revealed him&s;elf from the day of the lap&s;e? Is it in it&s;elf a truth, or fal&s;ehood, to &s;ay, that doing or repenting, &s;eparated from grace and Chri&s;t, will avail to give the &s;inner a title to eternal life? Surely, no one, knowing what he &s;ays, will affirm it to be a truth. Tis indeed im|po&s;&s;ible it &s;hould be, if what the in&s;pired writers uni|tedly declare, in the &s;acred books, may be tho't worthy of regard, And yet, our author makes the infinitely true God a voucher to its truth, and by a &s;olemn oath too. He will, perhaps, &s;ay, there is an IF in the ca&s;e. Life is connected with "doing or repenting", which will never come into event; becau&s;e no &s;inner can either do or repent in the &s;en&s;e intended. But what a pitiful &s;hift is this! How di&s;honorary to the father of mercies, and God of all &s;incerity! Notwith&s;tanding this IF, the &s;uppo&s;ition that is the ground of it, is a REAL FALSHOOD; becau&s;e a direct contradiction to the revealed method of God's admitting &s;inners to his favor. And &s;hall "the holy one of I&s;rael", who is infinitely removed from all guile, be introduced as connecting THIS FALSHOOD, ab&s;olutely &s;o in it&s;elf, with an IF, that it might not too vi&s;ibly carry with it the face of downright deceit? Far be it! The true purport of our author's comment on God's words, by the prophet Ezekiel, to the Jewi&s;h nation, and indeed to &s;inners in general, is plainly this, "tho' tis IM|POSSIBLE, as you are &s;inners, you &s;hould have a title to life, in the <HI>meer virtue,</HI> either of turning from your &s;ins, or doing righteou&s;ne&s;s; yet, I &s;olemnly &s;ay to you, and &s;wear by my life to the truth of what I &s;ay, this IMPOSSIBILITY notwith&s;tanding, if you will do ANOTHER, that is, thus turn from &s;in and do that which is right, which you can no more do than you can create a world, you &s;hall a&s;&s;uredly obtain life". I have not done the lea&s;t wrong to our author in this paraphra&s;e of his meaning. Tis the very thing he intends, however impious and ab&s;urd it may look, at the fir&s;t glance, thus &s;et in its true light. And his conduct hereupon, placed in the like point of clear view, will make the like appearance. Under the &s;pe|cious pretext of guarding &s;inners again&s;t the heinous crime of "&s;elf-ju&s;tifying labor", he zealou&s;ly di&s;|courages them, however di&s;tre&s;t about their &s;piritual &s;tate, from doing any thing, &s;ending up &s;o much as a cry, in the bitterne&s;s of their &s;ouls, to the God of all grace, in order to obtain "the &s;alutary truth"; tho' the obtainment of this truth, according to his own way of thinking, is that alone which is connected with life. And yet, he very loudly calls upon them to exert them|&s;elves with all their might in as truly "&s;elf-ju&s;tifying labor", by another &s;ort of doing and repenting, while he knows in his heart, at the &s;ame time, that neither their doing or repenting, in the &s;en&s;e he would urge them to it, will any more avail to their obtaining life, than if they &s;at &s;till and did nothing. That is, in plain words, he peremptorily forbids their making the lea&s;t attempt towards the obtainment of the only thing which can intere&s;t them in life; while yet, he would put them upon doing that, the doing of which would be as &s;ure a path to hell, as "that devout one" of the popular preachers, he &s;ometimes &s;peaks of. This is the plain engli&s;h of what he &s;ays. One can &s;carce think him &s;erious. If he is, he very &s;eriou&s;ly &s;ays a great deal to no purpo&s;e, unle&s;s to &s;et the &s;criptures in a ridiculous light: E&s;pecially, is there rea&s;on to think thus, as it is not his intention, by turning men to the law, to awaken in them a &s;en&s;e of &s;in and guilt, that, &s;eeing their danger, they may be in a more prepared frame of mind for the reception of "the &s;alutary truth".

What he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ans is, that the impious, profligate, hardned &s;inner, who has all his days lived in rioting and wantone&s;s, &s;tupidly tho'tle&s;s of God, and unconcerned about the requirements of religion, is as much in the way of obtaining mercy as the &s;in|ner, who, from a di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;en&s;e of the peri&s;hing need he &s;tands in of help, is rou&s;ed to the utmo&s;t diligence in "&s;eeking God, if perhaps he may be found of him". The "merciful truth", as he thinks, "needs no preparation for its reception".&mdash;It "prevents the mo&s;t harden'd rebels"; and they are in as fair a way to become po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it, as any &s;inners whatever. But the&s;e &s;entiments &s;tand in direct oppo&s;ition both to the letter and &s;pirit of numerous in&s;pired texts, which &s;peak of &s;inners as in "a better", or "wor&s;e &s;tate", with re&s;pect to their &s;alvation; as being in a "more" or "le&s;s likely way" to obtain the &s;alutary truth: As I &s;hall have occa&s;ion, particularly and largely to &s;hew, in a more proper place hereafter.

For he has deny'd all difference between &s;inners as to their finding "the &s;alutary truth"; very plainly in&s;inuating, that it is as likely it &s;hould be communicated to them while hardned in iniquity, as when awakened to a deep &s;en&s;e of their guilt and danger; while impiou&s;ly contemning God and &s;neering at religion, as when with the greate&s;t &s;ollicitude they are attending the in|&s;tituted means of grace: Nay, it &s;hould &s;eem, by what he has &s;ometimes &s;ugge&s;ted, as tho' the vile&s;t debauchees &s;tood, even, a better chance for the obtainment of the &s;aving truth, than tho&s;e who take care to e&s;cape the pol|lutions that are in the world thro' lu&s;t, and are &s;erious and earne&s;t in their u&s;e of the means of &s;alvation. He may think this a laudable zeal for the honor of free and &s;overeign grace; but tis, in reality of &s;en&s;e, "turning it into la&s;civiou&s;ne&s;s". I know of no man, who is more heinou&s;ly chargeable with "making Chri&s;t a mini&s;ter of &s;in", by u&s;ing him, and the grace of God thro' him, to encourage &s;inners, while "walking in the way of their own heart, and in the &s;ight of their eyes", to imagine they are in as fair a way to find the &s;aving truth, as when they are &s;eeking God for it in the be&s;t manner they are able.</NOTE> For he had, many hun|dreds

As if he had &s;aid, the law of Mo&s;es, in its complex view, made up of ceremonial in&s;titu|tions, and moral precepts, was added as an ap|pendix to the abrahamic covenant, "becau&s;e", or for the &s;ake, "of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions"; that is, either to prevent the commi&s;&s;ion of them, or, if they &s;hould be committed, to make them an occa&s;ion of &s;piritual &s;ervice.

tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. Hence tho&s;e words of the apo&s;tle Paul, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. 3.20.</NOTE> "by the law is the knowledge of &s;in"; that is, a more clear and certain knowledge of it, and, in &s;ome in&s;tances, a knowledge of it, when, had it not been for the revealed law, men would have been in total ignorance in this re&s;pect. To this purpo&s;e we read, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. 7.7.</NOTE> "I had not known &s;in but by the law", that is, I had not known it at all in &s;ome ca&s;es, and in none &s;o clearly and fully, had it not been for the revealed law.</P>
<P>"IT was added becau&s;e of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions", that is, that their malignant de&s;tructive nature and operation, as tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, might be more rea|dily &amp; fully apprehended. Hence that language of the apo&s;tle,<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. 7.9.</NOTE> "when the commandment came, I died".

And yet again, <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 11.</NOTE> "&s;in taking occa&s;ion from the com|mandment, &s;lew me".</P>
<P>IN fine, "it was added becau&s;e of tran&s;gre&s;&s;i|ons", that is, that the Jews, di&s;cerning more thorowly from the law, the criminous nature, and awful demerit, of their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, might be led into an affecting, convincing, con&s;train|ing apprehen&s;ion of the de&s;ireablene&s;s, greatne&s;s, and glory of divine grace in their pardon and &s;alvation. Hence the apo&s;tle Paul, after he had &s;aid, <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Rom. 5.20.</NOTE> "the law entered that &s;in might abound", immediately ob&s;erves, in the following words, "but where &s;in abounded, grace did much more abound" As if he had &s;aid, by how much more &s;in, in its evil nature, &amp; de&s;tructive tendency, is made to abound by the introduction of the law,
<PB N="52" REF="009925_0057_0F7B39732084AD30">
by &s;o much the more is grace rendered con&s;picuous and glorious in delivering from it. For &s;o it follows, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ver. 21.</NOTE> "that as &s;in hath reigned unto death, (that is, thro' the law, that being the &s;trength of &s;in, 1 Cor. 15.5, 6.) even &s;o might grace reign thro' righteou&s;ne&s;s unto eternal life by Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord". Tis certain, a clear and full view of the malignity and guilt of &s;in, as it is made to a|bound by the promulgated law of God, is power|fully adapted to &s;et off the riches of the glory of divine grace. And one of the chief things in|tended by God, in giving the law to the Jews was, that they might, in this way, be bro't to entertain in their minds exalted tho'ts of his grace, and be engaged to place all their dependance on it in the bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ine&s;s of &s;alvation. And it was happily &s;uited to &s;uch a purpo&s;e. They might, from the law, be ea&s;ily led to &s;ee, in a &s;trong and full light, their need of the mercy of God, the &s;upreme law-giver and king, and that they could be &s;aved in no way but that of grace, and the abounding of it towards them. Tis true, they did not generally make this u&s;e of the law; but the fault lay with them&s;elves, and not the divine law. This was very powerfully &s;uited to give them &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of &s;in and wrath as to put them upon flying to grace, as to that only which could give them hope of an acquitance before God, and coming to the enjoyment of him in a better &s;tate and world.</P>
<P>THE other rea&s;on, the apo&s;tle gives for the in|troduction of the law, among the Jews, is, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gal. 3.24.</NOTE> "that it might be their &s;chool-ma&s;ter to bring them to Chri&s;t, that they might be ju&s;tified by faith".
<PB N="53" REF="009925_0058_0F7B39738474BF40">
What he means is, that the law &s;tood connected, in the &s;cheme of God, with the promi&s;ed Me&s;&s;iah, and was a preparatory di&s;pen&s;ation for the more perfect &s;tate of things under the go&s;pel-oeconomy; as childhood is introductory to the more mature &s;tate of manhood, and a previous &s;ea&s;on &s;uitably making way for it by tuition and di&s;cipline. The apo&s;tle explains him&s;elf, upon this point, in the beginning of the next chapter, where he con&s;iders the Jews as "children under age", in compari&s;on with chri&s;tians under the go&s;pel; and "the law", as their "tutor and governor till the time ap|pointed of the father", that is, the more perfect &s;tate this was introductory to, in the times of Chri&s;t. And tis true of the "law", whether we con&s;ider it in regard of its "ceremonial in&s;tituti|ons", or "moral precepts", that it was de&s;igned by God as a kind of "&s;chool ma&s;ter to lead the Jews to Chri&s;t".</P>
<P>THE "law ceremonial" was introduced among them with this view; that is, it was a lower kind of &s;tate (like childhood in compare with manhood) appointed by God for their tuition &amp; in&s;truction, or to prepare them for, and &s;uitably inroduce them to, the more perfect &s;tate of things, which was to take place by the erection of the go&s;pel-di&s;pen&s;a|tion. This &s;eems to be the meaning of the apo&s;tle. The like account is given of this matter el&s;ewhere, in the new-te&s;tament-writings. Says this &s;ame apo&s;tle, &s;peaking of the Mo&s;aic ceremonial in&s;ti|tutions, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Col. 2.17.</NOTE> "which are a &s;hadow of good things to come, but the body is Chri&s;t"; that is, their &s;ub|&s;tance or reality is to be found in him. In like

manner, the law of rites is characteri&s;ed, in the epi&s;tle to the Hebrews, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. 10.1.</NOTE> as "having a &s;hadow of good things to come". It is indeed the main de|&s;ign of the writer of this epi&s;tle, to point out the analogy there is between the le&s;s perfect &s;tate of things under the law, &amp; the more perfect one un|der the go&s;pel, &amp; to lead us, at the &s;ame time, into the tho't, that the former of the&s;e &s;tates was, in the intention of God, emblematical of the latter, and preparatory to it. According to his &s;en&s;e of the matter, the temple, the holy of holies, the prie&s;thood, the &s;acrifices, and, in a word, the whole jewi&s;h ritual, were types or figures of &s;ome future aw&s;werable good things, de&s;igned for the in&s;truct|ion of the I&s;raelites, tho' in a lower degree, till the good things them&s;elves, which they repre|&s;ented, &s;hould take place in the times of Chri&s;t. It will, perhaps, be found impo&s;&s;ible to make a great part of this epi&s;tle intelligible, upon any &s;cheme of interpretation but that, which con&s;iders the jewi&s;h ceremonial as a pattern, type, or em|blematical repre&s;entation of that &s;tate of things, which was to be e&s;tabli&s;hed in the Go&s;pel-day.</P>
<P>I AM not in&s;en&s;ible, "the doctrine of types" has been abu&s;ed by &s;ome, and objected to, by o|thers, as unworthy of regard.</P>
<P>IT has been abu&s;ed by &s;ome, who have unhap|pily indulged to vain imaginations upon this &s;ub|ject; giving out their own fancies for the mean|ing of God's law.

The enemies of revelation have taken occa&s;ion herefrom to treat the things of God and religion with &s;neer and ridicule. But the doctrine of types ought not to be tho't the wor&s;e of upon this account. It may be the doctrine of &s;cripture, tho' men of &s;trong imaginations, and weak judg|ments, may have pointed out an analogy between the law and the go&s;pel, which never had exi&s;tence but in their own fancies; and tho' de&s;igning men may herefrom have taken occa&s;ion to &s;peak of &s;uch analogies with contempt. Both our Saviour him&s;elf, &amp; his apo&s;tles, do certainly con&s;ider many things under the jewi&s;h law, as prefigurations, &s;hadows, emblematical patterns of an&s;werable bet|ter things under the go&s;pel-di&s;pen&s;ation. There can be no rea&s;onable di&s;pute as to this. And if we take them for our guides, in&s;tead of giving an unre&s;trained &s;cope to imagination, there will be no danger of expo&s;ing religion by a meer fan|ciful application of the things contained in the writings of Mo&s;es and the Prophets.</P>
<P>THIS doctrine has al&s;o been objected to, as not worthy of regard; but upon rea&s;ons that are not convincing.</P>

The analogy between ancient things under the law, and an&s;werable events under the go&s;pel, is, in &s;o many in&s;tances, capable of being made out with &s;uch preci&s;ion &amp; certainty, as to exclude all probability of chance, and to render it highly rea|&s;onable to admit de&s;ign. That we may perceive this in a clear point of light, let us try to apply the &s;cripture types and prefigurations, as we call them, to other per&s;ons and events, than tho&s;e they are applied to in the new-te&s;tament. If de&s;ign be excluded, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Hartley, on man; who&s;e tho'ts on the Mo&s;aic types, are well worth reading.</NOTE>
<Q>the&s;e ought to be equally, or nearly &s;o, applicable to other per&s;ons &amp; events; which yet, I think, no &s;erious, con&s;iderate per|&s;on can affirm. Now, if chance be once ex|cluded, and the nece&s;&s;ity of having recour&s;e to de&s;ign be admitted, we &s;hall in&s;tantly be com|peled to acknowledge a contrivance greater than human, from the long di&s;tance of time in|tervening between the type, and the thing ty|pified, with other &s;uch-like rea&s;ons.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="009925_0062_0F7B39769C899290">IT is &s;aid again, the things which we call types had their "literal meaning", and "literal u&s;e", in ancient times; and tis unrea&s;onable to a&s;&s;ign to them a "double meaning and u&s;e". The re|ply is, if there really is an analogy between "jewi&s;h rites" and "go&s;pel-events", greater than can be &s;uppo&s;ed to re&s;ult from chance, or human fore|&s;ight, and &s;uch as obliges us to have recour&s;e to God; and this can be evidently made out in a good number of in&s;tances: Our being able to &s;hew, that the&s;e in&s;tituted rites had their "literal meaning and u&s;e", in former days, will be &s;o far from de&s;troying their nature as types or prefigu|rations, that it will rather argue the nece&s;&s;ity of a "double &s;en&s;e and u&s;e" of the&s;e things, and that it was in the actual view and de&s;ign of God in the in&s;titution of them.
<Q>All the works of God&mdash; (as Dr. Hartley expre&s;&s;es it) have various u&s;es and &s;ub&s;erviencies in re&s;pect of each other; and, if the &s;criptures are the word of God, analogy would lead one to expect &s;omething corre&s;pond|ing hereto in them.</Q></P>
<P>IN fine, it is &s;till objected, how was the law, when it refer'd to Chri&s;t, by the acknowledgment of all, only in a typical, figurative, emblematical way, a &s;uitable "&s;chool-ma&s;ter", or tutor, to lead the Jews into a true knowledge of him, or the go&s;pel-di&s;pen&s;ation that was to be erected by him? Did they under&s;tand the meaning of their "ritual in&s;titutions", con&s;idered in their typical reference? Did they u&s;e them with this refer|ence? Did they look beyond them to the things &s;aid to be repre&s;ented, or prefigured, by them? In an&s;wer whereto, I will not affirm, that the

Jews had, or that it was intended by God that they &s;hould have, a clear and full under&s;tanding of the things &s;hadowed forth, in their law, by types and emblematical figures. The &s;uppo&s;ition of &s;uch knowledge is incon&s;i&s;tent with that "mode of in&s;truction" they were under. As a late ex|cellent writer well ob&s;erves, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lowman, in his jewi&s;h ritual.</NOTE>
<Q>What was pre|figured of the times of the Me&s;&s;iah, either in the ancient prophets, or types of the "jewi&s;h ritual", was, in the apo&s;tle Peter's ju&s;t account of it,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Pet. 1.19.</NOTE> as a light that &s;hineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day-&s;tar ari&s;e in your hearts". Yet, dark as it was, it gave &s;ome light, and &s;uch as was of great advantage to the principal ends de&s;igned by it, and for which a fuller light was not nece&s;&s;ary. It will be lit|tle to our purpo&s;e to inquire, how far the Hebrew nation in general did actually under&s;tand their own ritual, and what it taught concerning the Me&s;&s;iah, his per&s;on, character and offices. It is more to the purpo&s;e to con&s;ider, how it might have been under&s;tood, if they had right|ly applied them&s;elves to the under&s;tanding of it.</Q>
And tho' we cannot &s;ay, particularly, how far their knowledge might have extended; yet we may &s;ay, in general, that they might have made con&s;iderable di&s;coveries of the more &s;ecret mean|ing, at lea&s;t, of their more important rites. As the la&s;t quoted author ob&s;erves,
<Q>The my&s;teries of Hieroglyphicks, and in&s;truction by &s;ymbols, in u&s;e among their neighbours, became a part of &s;tudy and &s;cience; and they learned many things by them, not obvious to common ob|&s;ervation.

The moral meaning of &s;acrifices, for in&s;tance, was of ea&s;y under&s;tanding. Why might not the Hebrews, from a general under|&s;tanding of that part of their ritual, be taught to expect a greater high-prie&s;t, better &s;acrifices, a better covenant, better promi&s;es and ble&s;&s;ings, in the times of the Me&s;&s;iah, who was to perfect all things wanting in their law?

<P>BUT of however &s;mall u&s;e, the "law ceremo|nial", in its typical &s;en&s;e, might be to the Jews BEFORE, it was highly &s;erviceable AT THE TIME OF THE COMING OF THE MESSIAH, to prepare their minds both for a more ready under&s;tanding of, and complying with, the method of &s;alvation thro' him.</P>
<P>IT was of great u&s;e, as a "&s;chool-ma&s;ter", to lead them more ea&s;ily into right conceptions of "the things pertaining to the kingdom of Chri&s;t". For, as it was a di&s;pen&s;ation, which really, tho' in figures and &s;hadows only, repre&s;ented the work and office of the Me&s;&s;iah, and that &s;alvation with which he was to "ble&s;s all nations of the earth", it could not but prepare their minds, unle&s;s they were &s;tupidly inattentive, the more readily to take in ju&s;t notions of the&s;e things, after his incarna|tion, death, re&s;urrection, and exaltation to heaven. However ob&s;cure their "ritual" might be, in for|mer days, as to its typical meaning, it was now opened and explained; in&s;omuch, that if they under&s;tood it formerly in no other than its "literal u&s;e and meaning", they would be <HI>now</HI> under ad|vantage

to under&s;tand the things that were figu|ratively &s;ignified by it. The plain truth is, "law" and "go&s;pel" mutually illu&s;trate each other. "By the go&s;pel it might be &s;een, that the law had a ty|pical reference; and by the law, the mind was prepared more readily &amp; ju&s;tly to conceive of the go&s;pel." The Jews, for in&s;tance, by having long &s;een and known the "literal" u&s;e and meaning of the "legal &s;acrifices", might more ea&s;ily have un|der&s;tood, by parity of rea&s;on, the nature, de&s;ign and efficacy, of the "one &s;acrifice", which Chri&s;t 'offer'd of him&s;elf to God", to "make reconciliation for iniquity"; arguing with them&s;elves,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. 9. 13, 14.</NOTE> "If the blood of bulls and of goats, and the a&s;hes of an heifer &s;prinkling the unclean, &s;anctified to the pu|rifying of the fle&s;h; how much more &s;hall the blood of Chri&s;t, who offered him&s;elf to God with|out &s;pot, purge your con&s;cience from dead works to &s;erve the living God"? In like manner, by their &s;eeing and knowing, that "the high-prie&s;t, once every year, entered into the holie&s;t of all, not without blood, both for him&s;elf and for the people", their minds were a&s;&s;i&s;ted to under&s;tand more ea&s;ily and clearly the things hereby meant, namely, "Chri&s;t's appearance for us in heaven", in virtue of "his blood &s;hed for us" on the earth.

<P>THE "law-moral" was, in like manner, "a &s;chool-ma&s;ter to bring the Jews to Chri&s;t". And, with great propriety, tis thus &s;poken of, as, by its prohibitions and threatnings, it was adapted to lead them into &s;uch a knowledge of &s;in, as had a powerful tendency to di&s;po&s;e and influence them to repair to "the mercy of the promi&s;e", and not to depend upon a claim to life founded on their own doings in conformity to law, &s;imply as &s;uch. It was well fitted, in this &s;en&s;e, to tutor and di&s;|cipline their minds. They could not, if they were faithful and impartial in comparing their hearts and lives with the demands of the law, but be con&s;cious to them&s;elves of many omi&s;&s;ions of duty and commi&s;&s;ions of &s;in; and when, with like faithfulne&s;s, they attended to the denuncia|tions of God again&s;t &s;in in every kind, they could not but be bro't to look upon them&s;elves as &s;tand|ing in ab&s;olute need of mercy, and under ab&s;o|lute obligations to fly to it by "faith", as ever they would entertain the lea&s;t hope of "ju&s;tifica|tion" in the &s;ight of that God, who&s;e law they had thus violated. It was "by the command|ment", as written in the divine law, "that &s;in became exceeding &s;inful" to the apo&s;tle Paul. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. 7.13.</NOTE> And it was by this &s;ight and apprehen&s;ion of &s;in, thro' the law, that the law became an <HI>in&s;tructor,

tutor,</HI> or <HI>&s;chool-ma&s;ter</HI> to him; teaching him not to depend on works in conformity to law, but to place his hope on the mercy of God thro' Je&s;us the redeemer. And the "law-moral" was given by God, to the Jews, that it might, in this way, be of &s;piritual &s;ervice to them. He intended it &s;hould be, as it were, "a &s;chool-ma&s;ter" to &s;hew them their de&s;erts by rea&s;on of &s;in, and in this way to di&s;engage them from tru&s;ting in their own doings for life, and put them upon repairing to "the promi&s;e" thro' the "&s;eed of Abraham". And it probably had this good effect upon mul|titudes of the Jews, in their &s;ucce&s;&s;ive generati|ons, from the days of Mo&s;es, till the coming of Chri&s;t, the promi&s;ed &s;eed.</P>
<P>AND now, from what has been di&s;cour&s;ed, we are naturally and obviou&s;ly led to entertain in our minds honorable tho'ts of the jewi&s;h law, in re|gard of its "ceremonial rites", as well as "moral precepts".</P>
<P>WE may, perhaps, have been ready to think contemptuou&s;ly of the jewi&s;h con&s;titution, on ac|count of tho&s;e "numerous rites" with which their wor&s;hip was encumbered. And, po&s;&s;ibly, what the &s;acred writers of the new-te&s;tament have &s;ometimes &s;aid, with reference to the&s;e "cere|monial ob&s;ervancies", may have led us into &s;uch tho'ts about them. But it ought always to be re|membered, that the&s;e "rites", however nu|merous, or burthen&s;ome, were appointed by the wi&s;dom and authority of God; who never would have appointed them, if it had not been rea&s;ona|ble, and, for the be&s;t, all things con&s;idered, that
<PB N="65" REF="009925_0070_0F7B397E0F628D88">
the Jews &s;hould be placed under &s;uch a religious con&s;titution. We may therefore be &s;ure, the in|&s;pired writers of the new-te&s;tament do never &s;peak contemptuou&s;ly of the&s;e "rites", or of the "jewi&s;h di&s;pen&s;ation," on account of them, but in a <HI>com|parative view</HI>; that is, &s;etting them in competi|tion with the better &s;tate of things under the go&s;|pel. In compare with the go&s;pel-in&s;titution, &s;ince the coming of Chri&s;t, the jewi&s;h con&s;titution was "weak, and beggerly, imperfect and unpro|fitable". And tis in this comparative &s;en&s;e, that it is thus &s;poken of in the new-te&s;tament-writings. It would be a di&s;honor to God, and a bare-fac'd reflection on his governing wi&s;dom, to &s;peak, in a contemptuous manner, of it in any other &s;en&s;e. For tho' it was not &s;o perfect an in&s;titution, as that which has been erected by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in the go&s;pel-day; yet, it was &s;uch an one as the wi&s;dom of God tho't be&s;t for that age of the world, and the circum&s;tances of the jewi&s;h nation. And, perhaps, it was as good and perfect an in&s;titution of religion as could have been contrived and e|rected, for that people, in that day. It was, as we have &s;een, well fitted to guard them again&s;t that "idolatrous wor&s;hip", which had corrupted the whole earth. And &s;o far as it was a &s;uitable means to an&s;wer &s;o good an end, there can be no rea&s;on|able room to complain, either of the wi&s;dom or goodne&s;s of God, tho' their ritual ob&s;ervances were many and burthen&s;ome; e&s;pecially if it be remembered, that he had it in view, by the&s;e Mo&s;aic ceremonies, to put them under tuition, that they might be prepared for higher expecta|tions, than they could rea&s;onably have from the law, &s;imply in it&s;elf. If when we have read the
<PB N="66" REF="009925_0071_0F7B397E7AFABD58">
&s;cripture-account of the numerous rites of the jewi&s;h &s;aw, we have confined our view to their meer "literal u&s;e and meaning", no wonder we have been di&s;pos'd to entertain an unbecoming notion of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he di&s;pen&s;ation they were placed under; imagining it &s;carce worthy of &s;o great and glorious an author, as the one true and living God. But our view has been too narrow and confin'd. The all-wi&s;e God appointed the u&s;e of the&s;e "ceremonial rites', as prefigurations, em|blematical de&s;criptions, of that only way to life, which has been clearly and fully opened, &s;ince the coming of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. And the jews, by means of tho&s;e "ritual in&s;titutions", as truly enjoy'd the GOSPEL in their day, as we do now; tho' more darkly- and ob&s;curely. Their &s;acrifices, their prie&s;ts, their temple, their whole manner of wor|&s;hip, were the go&s;pel in type and figure. And con&s;idering their circum&s;tances, together with the way in which it was determined Chri&s;t &s;hould come into the world, and accompli&s;h the work of man's redemption, this lower and more imperfect method of in&s;truction might be be&s;t &s;uited to an|&s;wer the purpo&s;es of God, and the good ends he had in pro&s;ecution. It might not be proper, they &s;hould know too much of the go&s;pel-plan; and this method of in&s;truction, by types and fi|gures, might be well adapted to let them into all the knowledge, it might be nece&s;&s;ary or proper they &s;hould then attain to. And the more piou&s;|ly con&s;iderate, among the Jews, might know more of the "typical &s;en&s;e" of the law, than we may be ready to imagine. I don't &s;ay, or think, that their knowle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ge, with re&s;pect to Chri&s;t and the go&s;pel, was any way to compare with our's, who&s;e

Mo&s;es him&s;elf, the jewi&s;h legi&s;lator, under God, "by faith" looked beyond the law to Chri&s;t, and beyond Canaan to heaven; and it was owing to this faith of his, that he was enabled to &s;urmount the difficulties he was called to meet with, "enduring affliction with the people of God, rather than enjoying the plea|&s;ures of &s;in for a &s;ea&s;on", <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. 11.25.</NOTE> as we read in the e|pi&s;tle to the Hebrews; where we are pre&s;ented with a long li&s;t of jewi&s;h worthies, after the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of the Mo&s;aic ritual, who, "by faith" looked beyond the "literal u&s;e of their law", and were influenced herefrom to behave &s;o as to ho|nor God, and be "accounted worthy of a better re&s;urrection", of the better things of the coming world. And the "ceremonial in&s;titutions" were all along, during the continuance of the Mo&s;aic dipen&s;ation, as a "&s;chool-ma&s;ter to the Jews; and the more &s;erious and inqui&s;itive among them were taught to expect &s;ome higher and better &s;tate of things; tho' they might not particularly know what it was, or how it would be accompli&s;h|ed. And the Jews, who lived when Chri&s;t made his appearence in the world, could &s;carce have had a better "&s;chool-ma&s;ter to bring them to him, that they might be ju&s;tified by faith", than the types and figures of the law.

What we are apt to a&s;cribe to the &s;ega|city and &s;trength of meer natural rea&s;on, may, po&s;|&s;ibly, with greater ju&s;tice, be attributed to the knowledge which learned men might have, in one way or another, of this Mo&s;aic delineation of the law of rea&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="009925_0074_0F7B3981DDBBD100">TO be &s;ure, we, who&s;e lot it is to live &s;ince the coming of Chri&s;t, and the explanation of the "Mo&s;aic moral precepts,", by him and his apo&s;|tles, and their adoption into the chri&s;tian &s;cheme, may reap all the advantages, it was propo&s;ed the Jews &s;hould reap by them; and in a much higher degree. The "law moral" is not turned out as a "&s;chool-ma&s;ter", but &s;till &s;u&s;tains this office, tho' Chri&s;t is come. Nay, &s;o far is the "moral law" from being u&s;ele&s;s, as a "&s;chool-ma&s;ter", under the go&s;pel-di&s;pen&s;ation, "to lead men to Chri&s;t, that they may be ju&s;tified by faith", that it is of &s;tronger influence to this purpo&s;e, than it was be|fore he came into the world "for the redempti|on of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors". For "this law", under the go&s;pel-di&s;pen&s;ation, and as introduced into it, more fully commands duty, and prohibits &s;in; and does both under the &s;anction of death, beyond the grave, more clearly and certainly revealed, in ca&s;e of &s;in. It is therefore more powerfully fitted to convince of &s;in and guilt, and &s;hew men that they mu&s;t die in their &s;ins, unle&s;s they repair, by faith to grace and go&s;pel, that they may be pardoned and &s;aved. For chri&s;tians can no more be ju&s;tified by law, than the Jews could of old. A &s;erious truth this! And we &s;hould all lay it to heart; making u&s;e of the law, even under the di&s;pen&s;a|tions of the go&s;pel, to di&s;cover &s;in, and learn our danger, that we may from hence be awakened to flee from law to grace; depending on Chri&s;t, and not upon law, for ju&s;tification in God's fight.</P>

<HEAD>SERMON III. The Nature of Faith, as ju&s;tifying, particularly a&s;certained.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>GALATIANS II. 16.</BIBL>
<P>"Knowing that a man is not ju&s;tified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, even we have believed in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that we might be ju&s;ti|fied by the faith of Chri&s;t".</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>TWO ways of ju&s;tification are here pointed out. One, "by the works of the law"; the other, "by the faith of Chri&s;t". The former i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> declared, not to be the go&s;pel-way of ju&s;tification; and we have, in a former di&s;cour&s;e, proved it to be impo&s;&s;ible, that &s;inners, as man|kind all are, &s;hould be ju&s;tified "by their works". The latter way of ju&s;tification, here &s;poken of, is "by the faith of Je&s;us Chri&s;t". And the apo&s;tle Paul accordingly &s;ays, with re&s;pect both to him|&s;elf, and the Galatians to whom he writes, that
<PB N="71" REF="009925_0076_0F7B3982FA721CC8">
they "had believed in Je&s;us Chri&s;t"; and to this end, that they "might be ju&s;tified by the faith of Chri&s;t". What therefore I have more e&s;pe|cially in view, from this text, at this time, is to point out to you, in as plain and ea&s;y a manner as I am able, the meaning of faith, as connected with ju&s;tification.</P>
<P>IN order whereto, I &s;hall neither trouble my|&s;elf, nor you, with tho&s;e di&s;criptions of this faith, which are to be &s;een in books wrote upon the &s;ubject. They a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e almo&s;t as numerous as the books that contain them And if one w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re to judge, from the differing accounts they give of this fir&s;t and great principle of chri&s;tianity, he would readily be led to imagine, it was as per|plext a point as any in religion. Whereas, if we con&s;ult the bible only, and take our idea of faith from this &s;acred book, we &s;hall meet with no difficulty. The preci&s;e meaning of this word, as u&s;ed in the new-te&s;tament, and connected with ju&s;tification, is ea&s;y to be under&s;tood; as indeed it might rea&s;onably be expected it &s;hould, faith being a matter not only of e&s;&s;ential, but univer|&s;al concern.</P>
<P>FAITH and knowledge, both agreeing in the a&s;&s;ent of the mind to apprehended truth, are &s;ome|times, le&s;s acurately &s;peaking, u&s;ed for one and the &s;ame thing: Whereas, they really differ The a&s;&s;ent of the mind, in faith, is gained one way; in knowledge, another. Faith is the mind's a&s;&s;ent upon te&s;timony; and upon the te&s;timony of God, if the faith is chri&s;tian. And tis this that di&s;tin|gui&s;hes faith from knowledge, which is an a&s;&s;ent
<PB N="72" REF="009925_0077_0F7B3984E98E59F8">
grounded on the perception of the bodily &s;en&s;es, or the operation of our rea&s;onable powers. Ex|ternal objects &s;trike our &s;en&s;es, and we at once know what impre&s;&s;ions we receive from them. And we have an ability of mind to rea&s;on upon things, comparing them together, deducing con|&s;equences from them, forming a judgment how far this or that is true or fal&s;e, and giving or with|holding our a&s;&s;ent accordingly. In this &s;en&s;e, there are many things, which, tho' invi&s;ible, lite|rally &s;peaking, may yet, in the language of the apo&s;tle Paul, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. 1.20.</NOTE> be &s;aid to be "clearly &s;een, being under&s;tood". We know them to be truths by our rea&s;onings, without information from others. But the faith we are treating of is not of this &s;ort. It "comes by hearing", as the &s;cripture-expre&s;&s;ion is. It is the a&s;&s;ent of our minds to what has been te&s;tified to. The ground of this a&s;&s;ent is not like that of knowledge, but herein differs from it, that tis bottom'd on "the witne&s;s of God". His word, and that only, in the final re&s;ult, is the proper ade|quate ground of our faith.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY, two things are to be con&s;ider|ed in the faith that is connected with ju&s;tification, "the object about which it is conver&s;ant", and "the per&s;ua&s;ion or a&s;&s;ent of the mind with refer|ence to this object.</P>
<P>AS to the "object" of faith;&mdash;this is the re|port of the go&s;pel, or, in other words, "the truth", as revealed by Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles. Hence that affirmation of our Lord, "he that believeth", that is, "the go&s;pel", he had commi&s;&s;ioned his
<PB N="73" REF="009925_0078_0F7B398597BF8F30">
apo&s;tles to preach, "&s;hall be &s;aved". <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mark 16.16.</NOTE> Hence al&s;o that pa&s;&s;age in one of Paul's epi&s;tles to the The&s;&s;alonians, where &s;peaking of their being "cho&s;en to &s;alvation", he immediately &s;ubjoins, "thro' belief of the truth", the truth "as it is in Je&s;us", the truth as contained in the apo&s;tolic writings. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 The&s;. 2.13.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE object of faith is often &s;ummarily ex|pre&s;&s;ed in &s;ome capital article only; &s;ometimes one, &s;ometimes another.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES the comprehen&s;ive object of faith is "God". So we read of Abraham, that he "be|lieved God, and his faith was counted to him for righteou&s;ne&s;s". <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gal. 3.6.</NOTE> And our Saviour affirms with a double vehemence, "verily, verily, he that be|lieveth on him that &s;ent me hath everla&s;ting life, and &s;hall not come into condemnation". <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Joh. 5.24.</NOTE> In like manner, the apo&s;tle Paul, &s;peaking of tho&s;e who were "ju&s;tified by grace, that they &s;hould be heirs according to the hope of eternal life", de&s;cribes them in that language, "they which have believ|ed in God". <NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">Tit. 3.7, 8.</NOTE></P>
<P>SOMETIMES "Chri&s;t" is the &s;pecified object of faith. Hence that apo&s;tolic direction to the trembling jailor, "believe on the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and thou &s;halt be &s;aved". <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Acts 16.31.</NOTE> Con|&s;onant whereto are tho&s;e words in my text, "Knowing that a man is ju&s;tified by the faith of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, even we have believed in Je&s;us Chri&s;t". Accordingly, the &s;um of Paul's preaching at Ephe|&s;us,
<PB N="74" REF="009925_0079_0F7B3986714524D8">
in which he had "kept nothing back that was profitable to them", is expre&s;&s;ed in tho&s;e words, "te&s;tifying both to the Jews, and al&s;o to the Greeks, repentance towards God, and faith towards our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t".<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts 20.21.</NOTE></P>
<P>SOMETIMES Chri&s;t viewed as the "Me&s;&s;iah", pointed out by Mo&s;es and the prophets, in the writings of the old-te&s;tament, is the object of faith. Hence that profe&s;&s;ion of Martha, "I be|lieve that thou art Chri&s;t that &s;hould come into the world". <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Joh. 11.27.</NOTE> Agreeable whereto is that noble confe&s;&s;ion of Simon Peter, in the name of the a|po&s;tles, "we believe and are &s;ure that thou art that Chri&s;t", <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Joh. 6.69.</NOTE></P>
<P>SOMETIMES Chri&s;t con&s;idered as the "Son of God" is the object of faith. Hence the grand di&s;criminating characteri&s;tic of one that is "born of God, and overcometh the world" is that, "he believeth that Je&s;us is the Son of God".<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">1 Joh. 5.5.</NOTE> And tis univer&s;ally affirmed of every one "that &s;hall con|fe&s;s that Je&s;us is the &s;on of God", that "God dwelleth in him, and he in God". <NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">1 Joh. 4.15.</NOTE> And, as our Lord him&s;elf &s;ays, "God gave his only begotten &s;on, that who&s;oever believeth in him &s;hould not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting life". <NOTE N="*&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Joh. 3.16.</NOTE> And John bapti&s;t declares, "he that believeth on the &s;on hath everla&s;ting life". <NOTE N="&dagger;&sect;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 36.</NOTE></P>
<P>SOMETIMES Chri&s;t, as "dying and &s;hedding his blood", is the object of faith. Hence the apo&s;tle Paul, &s;peaking of Chri&s;t, and redemption thro'
<PB N="75" REF="009925_0080_0F7B3986C226EF10">
him, &s;ays, "whom God hath &s;et forth to be a pro|pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ation thro' faith in his blood", that blood of his which is the great atonement, and was &s;hed for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. 3.25.</NOTE> And one &s;pecial arti|cle, this &s;ame apo&s;tle had preached to the Corinthi|ans, as that by which they &s;hould be &s;aved, and which he would have them keep in memory un|le&s;s they would believe in vain, was, "that Chri&s;t died for our &s;ins according to the &s;criptures". <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. 15. 1, 2, 3.</NOTE></P>
<P>SOMETIMES, in fine, Chri&s;t, as "ri&s;en from the dead", is the object of faith; as in that ob&s;erv|able pa&s;&s;age in Paul's epi&s;tle to the Romans "if thou &s;hal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> confe&s;s with thy mouth the Lord Je&s;us, and &s;halt believe in him that God hath rai&s;ed from the dead, thou &s;halt be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">" <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. 10.9.</NOTE> And well might this be reckoned among the capital articles; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or, as this &s;ame apo&s;tle argues, "if Chri&s;t be not ri&s;en, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is al&s;o vain, ye are yet in your &s;ins". <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. 15. 14, 17.</NOTE></P>
<P>IN the&s;e, and a great number of &s;imilar texts, I might ea&s;ily have turned you to, one point only is mentioned as comprehending the object of faith. But then it &s;hould be particularly mind|ed, whenever the truth to be believed is thus &s;um|marily expre&s;&s;ed it ought to be under&s;tood, not meerly in con&s;i&s;tency with other revealed truths, but rather as re&s;olving it&s;elf into them by fair im|plication and natural deduction. To believe that Je&s;us is the Chri&s;t, or that he died for our &s;ins, or that he ro&s;e again for our ju&s;tification, if be|lieved in their true &s;en&s;e, and ju&s;t latitude, will
<PB N="76" REF="009925_0081_0F7B39877B6D6CB8">
amount to the &s;ame thing with believing the whole doctrine of the go&s;pel; for the doctrine of the go&s;pel is really nothing more than the&s;e truths unfolded by Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles, and &s;et forth in a full point of view. Our faith therefore in the&s;e, or the like capital articles, can't be that which is connected with ju&s;tification, if we leave that out of their meaning, which &s;ubverts their true import; or mix that with them, which e&s;&s;en|tially counter-acts their proper de&s;ign, and genu|ine tendency. In either of the&s;e ca&s;es, we be|lieve a lie, in&s;tead of the truth; "wre&s;ting the &s;criptures to our own de&s;truction".</P>
<P>ONLY, it &s;hould be heedfully ob&s;erved here, if the faith of tho&s;e who profe&s;s them&s;elves chri&s;ti|ans has, in our apprehen&s;ion, no other e&s;&s;ential de|fect than an imagined mi&s;take, relative to the truth to be believed, great care &s;hould be taken that we don't too ha&s;tily, and peremptorily, heighten this mi&s;take into &s;uch an incon&s;i&s;tency with the go&s;pel, as &s;hall be &s;ubver&s;ive of it; ranking the per&s;ons, who are chargeable with it, among tho&s;e who "&s;hall be damned for not believing the truth, but having plea&s;ure in unrighteou&s;ne&s;s". For it is not every real error, in point of belief, that will give ju&s;t occa&s;ion for &s;o &s;evere a judg|ment. Who is there, among the profe&s;&s;ors of faith in Chri&s;t, that has in his mind an unerring perception of all the truths of the go&s;pel-revela|tion? Who, that does not labor of &s;ome po&s;itive unhappy mi&s;take, in this or the other in&s;tance? There is not a believer on this &s;ide heaven, who&s;e faith is perfectly pure, having no mixture of er|ror in it. Tis true, the error, if he is a ju&s;tified
<PB N="77" REF="009925_0082_0F7B39884676D0D0">
believer, can't &s;o oppo&s;e the mi&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t into the world to be the Saviour of it, either directly or by ju&s;t con&s;equence, as to nullifie his death, or make it of little or no importance. And when|ever the faith a man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es is of this &s;ort, tis e&s;&s;entially faulty, and &s;tands connected with con|demnation, rather than ju&s;tification. But then it &s;hould always be remembered, there is a great difference between its being thus connected, in the reality of the thing, and in our apprehen&s;ion of it. God only is the proper judge in this mat|ter, as he only is unerring in his judgment. No man living, be his abilities what they will, can form any other than a fallible judgment in the ca&s;e: For which rea&s;on, it may differ from the truth, and God's judgment with reference to it. God may &s;ee, in this and the other in&s;tance, where ignorance and error are mixed with truth, tho' men, who are partial in their views, may not, that neither the ignorance nor error are &s;uch, as will defeat its de&s;ign, or de&s;troy its operation to the ab&s;olutely needed purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>THE apo&s;tle Peter was doubtle&s;s in a ju&s;tified &s;tate, when he made that profe&s;&s;ion, "Thou art Chri&s;t, the &s;on or the living God" <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. 16.16.</NOTE> For our Lord's an&s;wer is, "ble&s;&s;ed art thou, Simon Bar|jona, for fle&s;h and blood hath not revealed it to thee, but my father which is in heaven". <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 17.</NOTE> And yet, at this time, he had no notion of Chri&s;t as "the propitiation for &s;in" Far from it, he even rebuked our Lord for "&s;hewing to his di&s;ciples, how that he mu&s;t go to Jeru&s;alem, and &s;uffer ma|ny things of the elders, and chief prie&s;ts, and

&s;cribes, and be killed and rai&s;ed again the third day". <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ver. 21, 22.</NOTE> And the other apo&s;tles, tho' in a ju&s;ti|fied &s;tate al&s;o, (Judas excepted) as believing that Je&s;us was the Chri&s;t, yet had no idea, any more than Peter, of the nece&s;&s;ity of his dying to make atonement for &s;in. For when our Lord told them, that he &s;hould be "delivered unto the Gentiles, to be mocked, &s;pitefully intreated, &s;pit upon, &s;courged and put to death, and that he &s;hould ri&s;e again the third day", what he &s;aid was &s;o re|mote from any apprehen&s;ions they had of this &s;ort, that "they under&s;tood none of the&s;e things, they were hid from them, neither knew they the things which were &s;poken". <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Luk. 18.31. to the 35th.</NOTE> Nay, &s;o de&s;titute was their faith in Chri&s;t of any imagined connection with his dying and ri&s;ing again, that they &s;eem, upon his death, to have given up all hope with reference to his being the promi&s;ed Me&s;&s;iah. Say they, "We tru&s;ted it had been he which &s;hould have redeemed I&s;rael".<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Luk. 24.21.</NOTE> And be&s;ides this igno|rance, relative to the great work of Chri&s;t as Sa|viour, their faith was mixt with po&s;itive error of no &s;mall importance. For they were full of the notion prevalent in that day, concerning the Me&s;&s;iah, that he was to be head and Lord of a kingdom in this world, and that one of the main de&s;igns of his coming was to &s;et up &s;uch a king|dom. It was, as influenced by this tho't, that they di&s;covered great vanity in their imaginations, and an undue temper of mind in regard of one another, while they were concerned who among them &s;hould be the greate&s;t mini&s;ter in this world|ly kingdom. <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">See the account at large in Matth. 20.20. to the 29th. Mark 10.35. to the 45th. Luk. 22.24. to the 30th.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="009925_0084_0F7B398AB70FB7E8">HAD our Lord been of the temper of &s;ome, who, we would hope, are his real di&s;ciples, he would have pronounced the faith of his apo&s;tles, at this time, an empty profe&s;&s;ion, as bewraying total ignorance of the true character, both of the fa|ther, and of him&s;elf: And he might the rather have been di&s;po&s;ed to this, as his &s;ufferings, death and re&s;urrection had all been foretold in the pro|phe&s;ies of the old-te&s;tament; and as be&s;ides, he had plainly and particularly &s;aid it him&s;elf, that "the &s;on of man ought, according to the &s;crip|tures, both to die and ri&s;e again". But, in&s;tead of telling them their faith was vain, and that they notwith&s;tanding all their profe&s;&s;ions of regard to him, were in a &s;tate of damnation, he meekly conde&s;cended to "expound to them the &s;crip|tures, concerning him&s;elf"; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luk. 24.27.</NOTE> and he did it with &s;uch light and love as to make "their hearts burn within them, while he talked with them in the way, and opened to them the &s;criptures."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 32.</NOTE> And in con&s;equence of the&s;e in&s;tructions, whereby "their under&s;tandings, as well as the &s;criptures, were opened",<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 45.</NOTE> a once dead, but afterwards ri&s;en, Je&s;us became the great object of their faith. Their faith, before, embraced all the truth that was ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, in their then circum&s;tances, in order to its being connected with a &s;tate of ju&s;ti|fication: But, being now differently &s;ituated, having the advantage of clearer light and more perfect in&s;truction, the object of their faith was enlarged. They not only believed in Chri&s;t, as fir&s;t crucified, and then glorified; but made this the delightful &s;ubject of their preaching, tho' it
<PB N="80" REF="009925_0085_0F7B398B5B5832C8">
was "to the Jews a &s;tumbling-block, and to the Gentiles fooli&s;hne&s;s".</P>
<P>WE cannot place before our view a better pat|tern of conduct towards tho&s;e, who&s;e faith in Chri&s;t, as we apprehend, is mixt with ignorance, or error, or both, however dangerous, &s;hould it be per&s;i&s;ted in, than this of our Saviour. In imi|tation of him, we &s;hould, with kindne&s;s and can|dor, make all rea&s;onable allowance for their &s;pe|cial &s;ituation in life, their temptations, di&s;advan|tages, yea, their prejudices, whether ari&s;ing from education, the books and company they have conver&s;ed with, or from whatever other cau&s;e; and in&s;tead of magi&s;terially pronouncing their faith a lie that is connected with damnation, we &s;hould rather endeavour, in all proper ways, within our &s;phere, to &s;et the truth before them in the &s;tronge&s;t point of light, that their under|&s;tandings being opened, they may renounce their errors, and "receive the truth in the love of it."</P>
<P>AND this, I may particularly &s;ugge&s;t here, is the proper office of chri&s;tian charity or love. And, if it reigns in our hearts, as it ought to do, it will put us upon exerting our&s;elves, as we have opportu|nity and ability, to enlighten our ignorant or mi&s;|taken brethren, and in proportion to the danger we think their ignorance or error are attended with: Whereas, it is no part of the duty of charity or love to do that, we are neither qualified for, nor authori&s;ed to, that is, to &s;it in judgment up|on our fellow-chri&s;tians, and determine, if they don't believe ju&s;t as we imagine they ought to do,
<PB N="81" REF="009925_0086_0F7B398C241BB6A0">
that damnation will be the con&s;equence. The apo&s;tle Paul, in his de&s;cription of charity or love, &s;ays, among other things, "charity vaunteth not it&s;elf, is not puffed up". <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. 13.4.</NOTE> It does not make men conceited and vain, fondly imagining, upon their believing the truth, as they think, that they are at once infallible, and properly qualified to judge the &s;piritual &s;tate of others.

It won't put a man upon a&s;&s;uming airs of &s;uperiority, as tho' he were an apo&s;tle of Chri&s;t, or rather Chri&s;t him&s;elf.

He can't, if he is a ju&s;tified believer, in contradiction to the light of his mind, oppo&s;e or deny any one thing, be it what it will, that has been taught and publi&s;hed in the revelations of God. Not but that he may fall into mi&s;takes, not apprehending the mind of Chri&s;t, &s;o as to admit that for a truth of his, in this and the other in&s;tance, which is really a fal&s;e|hood: Tho' it mu&s;t be &s;aid, at the &s;ame time, he can't &s;o far mi&s;apprehend tho&s;e truths, that are

<P>TIS ob&s;ervable, the &s;pecial rea&s;on, in all the&s;e in&s;tances, why the faith &s;poken of was e&s;&s;entially faulty, is fetched, not &s;o much from error cleav|ing to the object believed, as from the mind's per&s;ua&s;ion with reference to this object.</P>
<P>THERE is indeed nothing &s;aid concerning "the&s;e rulers", from whence we are led to think, that their faith, in their then circum&s;tances, was totally mi&s;placed in regard of its object. To be|&s;ure, it is not &s;ugge&s;ted, that they mixt &s;o much fal&s;ehood with the truth, as that the truth, by that mixture, was intirely &s;ubverted. The fault rather lay in the per&s;ua&s;ion of their mind, which was not &s;o rooted and enliven'd as to over-ballance the fear of man with the fear of God, and the prai&s;e of man with the prai&s;e of God. For &s;o our
<PB N="87" REF="009925_0092_0F7B399100484BD0">
Saviour's account of the matter runs. "Among the chief rulers al&s;o many believed on him; but, becau&s;e of the phari&s;ees, they did not con|fe&s;s him, le&s;t they &s;hould be put out of the &s;ynagogue: For they loved the prai&s;e of man more than the prai&s;e of God". They had been wro't upon, by what they had &s;een and heard of our Saviour, to a&s;&s;ent to it as true, that he was the promi&s;ed Me&s;&s;iah; but the fear of loo&s;ing honor from men, and expo&s;ing them|&s;elves to their di&s;plea&s;ure, over-powered the in|fluence of this per&s;ua&s;ion, it was &s;o poorly &s;et|tled in their minds.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame may be &s;aid of the "many at Jeru|&s;alem, that believed in his name". It does not ap|pear, that they erred concerning the object of faith; at lea&s;t, that they erred e&s;&s;entially. They were per&s;uaded, from the miracles which they &s;aw our Lord do, that he was the Chri&s;t. But this per|&s;ua&s;ion was &s;o feeble in their minds, that our Saviour, who "knew what was in man", knew that it was not &s;ufficiently powerful to make it &s;afe for him to commit him&s;elf to them. Had this truth &s;o firmly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed their hearts, as to engage them to adhere to him, in whom they had believed, in oppo&s;ition to all difficulties and haz|zards, our Lord, who "knew all men", would have readily "tru&s;ted him&s;elf with them". <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Our author &s;ays, pag. 302.
<Q>If any man's faith be found in&s;ufficient to &s;ave him, it is owing to this, that what he believed for truth was not the very &s;ame thing the apo&s;tles believed, but &s;ome lie connected with, or dre&s;&s;ed up in the form of truth. So this faith can do him no good, becau&s;e, however &s;eriou&s;ly and &s;incerely he believes, yet that which he believes is fal&s;e, and therefore it cannot &s;ave him.</Q>
It does not appear, that the above-mentioned chief rulers, and common Jews, did not believe the &s;ame truth the apo&s;tles them&s;elves, at that time, believed: Nor is there any thing &s;aid, with reference to them, from whence it can be collected, that their faith did them no good, ONLY becau&s;e what they believed was fal&s;e. What they believed concerning Chri&s;t was, no doubt, mixed with error; and &s;o was the faith even of the apo&s;tles, at that time. But this mixture of error was not the ONLY, or indeed the principal, defect of their faith. It rather lay, as has been &s;aid, in its not being an enlivened, firmly-e&s;tabli&s;ht &s;pring of action. They might, for aught any thing that is &s;aid to the con|trary, have had the &s;ame idea, e&s;&s;entially, with the apo&s;tles, of the Me&s;&s;iah-&s;hip of our Lord; which, by the way, was then a very poor, low and imperfect one, in compare with the truth. It may therefore be as nece&s;&s;ary to inquire, "how a man believes"? as "what he believes"? For &s;hould he believe the truth, unle&s;s he &s;o believed it, as that his faith would cer|tainly "work by love", that love which is "the ful|filling of the law", he would as &s;urely be in a &s;tate of wrath, notwith&s;tanding his faith, as if he "believed a lie in&s;tead of the truth". Our author further il|lu&s;trates what he had affirmed by &s;aying, pag. ibid.
<Q>The &s;aving truth which the apo&s;tles believed was, <HI>that Je&s;us is the Chri&s;t.</HI>" The apo&s;tles had one uni|form fixed &s;en&s;e to the&s;e words, and the whole new-te&s;tament is writ to a&s;certain to us in what &s;en&s;e they under&s;tood them. Every one who believes that <HI>Je&s;us is the Chri&s;t,</HI> in a different &s;en&s;e from the apo&s;tles, or who maintains any thing in connection with the&s;e words &s;ubver&s;ive of their real meaning, believes a fal&s;ehood; &s;o his faith cannot &s;ave him.</Q>
What is here offered is partly true, and partly fal&s;e. The apo&s;tles, far from having always had "one uni|form fixed &s;en&s;e" to this propo&s;ition, <HI>Je&s;us is the Chri&s;t,</HI> certainly entertained, in different periods of their a|po&s;tolic life, widely different tho'ts about it. As has been &s;aid, pag. 77, 78. before the death and re&s;urrection of our Lord, and yet after the apo&s;tles were ju&s;tified believers, the obedience of Chri&s;t to the death of the cro&s;s, as the great atonement for the &s;ins of men, was not included in their idea of his being <HI>the Chri&s;t.</HI> They had then no conception of him in this view of his character; which, I am ready to think, our author would make a damning fault in the belief of tho&s;e, who &s;hould now profe&s;s faith in him as <HI>the Chri&s;t,</HI> be|cau&s;e it would leave out of the&s;e words one of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential truths contained in them. Nay, after the death and re&s;urrection of our Lord, the meaning of this capital article, in its full latitude, was but gra|dually opened to them. Even Peter him&s;elf, a con|&s;iderable number of years after the de&s;cent of the Holy Gho&s;t upon the apo&s;tles, needed a vi&s;ion from heaven to in&s;truct him in this truth, that is now ea&s;ily under|&s;tood by every one, namely, that there is "no differ|ence in Chri&s;t Je&s;us between Jews and Gentiles", as by "his cro&s;s he has broken down the partition-wall", and placed mankind, without di&s;tinction, upon the &s;ame foot in point of acceptance with God. Without all doubt, the apo&s;tles them&s;elves, and other believers in their day, put more or le&s;s into the meaning of the above propo&s;ition, according to the mea&s;ure of their knowledge in the things pertaining to the kingdom of Chri&s;t. And believers, ju&s;tified ones I mean, have all along done &s;o; and they do the &s;ame now: Tho', I would add, it was certainly a truth in the apo&s;tles days, and in every age &s;ince, and always will be in ages yet to come, that who&s;oever mixes with the&s;e words, <HI>Je&s;us is the Chri&s;t,</HI> errors that are e&s;&s;en|tially de&s;tructive of the grand truth intended to be conveyed by them, believes with a faith that cannot &s;ave him. And the &s;ame may be &s;aid of tho&s;e al&s;o, who leave out of this propo&s;ition, in their conception of it, tho&s;e ideas, without which it would not include the truths, that are fundamentally nece&s;&s;ary to the ju&s;tification of life. But then, it &s;hould be remem|bered, neither our author, nor any other fallible man, however &s;elf-&s;ufficient, can run the line, with &s;uch preci&s;ion, between what may, and may not, be le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t out of the above grand article, as to &s;ay, with any manner of certainty, applying what he &s;ays to particular per|&s;ons, that they mu&s;t believe it in ju&s;t &s;uch a &s;en&s;e, or their faith will be a "lie", or "e&s;&s;entially mixed with fal&s;ehood", and "&s;o cannot &s;ave them". The omni&s;ci|ent God, who only knows men's capacities, &s;ituation in life, opportunities, advantages, and the like, which are infinitely various, is the alone infallible judge in this matter; and he ought accordingly to be con&s;idered as &s;uch: Nor &s;hould any pre&s;ume to take that work into their hands, which is properly his, and he only is fit for.</NOTE></P>

Their fault therefore was, not that they believed a lie, in&s;tead of the truth; but their per&s;ua&s;ion of the truth was &s;lighty and &s;uperfi|cial, and for this rea&s;on in&s;ufficient to bear the tryal of hard treatment for the truth's &s;ake. The &s;ame thing he &s;ays of the thorny ground-hearers: They al&s;o "received the &s;eed", that is, the pure word of God. What they believed was the truth; but their faith, not being a well-rooted and deeply fixed per|&s;ua&s;ion of mind, was over-powered by "the cares of the world, and the deceitfulne&s;s of riches". And tis ob|&s;ervable, the &s;pecial rea&s;on our Lord gives, why the good-ground-hearers bro't forth fruit, and in plenty, is, not meerly that they believed the truth, which the others did not; but, having "heard the word, they KEPT it"; that is, they retained the word, the truth, in their hearts by frequent recollection, and thorow con&s;ideration. In Matthew, the words are, "he that received the &s;eed into the good ground, is he that heareth the word, and under&s;tandeth it". Our author puts an empha&s;is upon this word UNDERSTANDETH, printing it in capitals, pag. 305. as tho' the rea&s;on of the fruitfulne&s;s of this kind of hearers, in oppo&s;ition to the unfruitfulne&s;s of the other, lay in this ONLY, that they UNDERSTOOD the truth, and preci&s;ely in the &s;en&s;e that he is plea&s;ed to put upon it too; while the other mi&s;took it, or &s;o corrupted it with fal&s;ehood, that they really believed a lie in&s;tead of the truth.

And this tran&s;lation is certainly the mo&s;t proper in the pa&s;&s;age we are upon, as Luke u&s;es another word, which very plainly a&s;certains the meaning of our Lord. "Hav|ing heard the word, they KEPT it"; which certainly implies recollection, attention, con&s;ideration: How otherwi&s;e was it morally po&s;&s;ible, the word &s;hould have been "kept", retained in their minds?</NOTE></P>

<P>WITH re&s;pect to this per&s;ua&s;ion, which is connected with a man's being in a &s;aved &s;tate, the "ground" or "rea&s;on" of it is the witne&s;s of God. He &s;ees God &s;peaking in the &s;acred &s;criptures, and admits the doctrines, there contained, into his mind, as undoubted ve|rities, becau&s;e te&s;tified to as &s;uch by the faithful God. Hence that de&s;cription of &s;aving faith, "he that receiveth his te&s;timony [the te&s;timony of Chri&s;t] hath &s;et to his &s;eal that God is true; for he, whom God hath &s;ent, &s;peaketh the words of God". <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Joh. 3.33, 34.</NOTE> Hence al&s;o the apo&s;tle Paul, giving an account of the faith of the The&s;&s;alonians, for which he "thanked God without cea&s;ing", does it in that language, "when ye received the word of God, which ye received of us, ye received it not as the word of man, but (as it is in truth) the word of God". <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 The&s;&s;. 2.13.</NOTE> When the faith men are the &s;ubjects of is ju&s;tifying, the true bottom of it is the te&s;timony of God. They have a view of God, as &s;peaking in the &s;acred books, different from what they had before. They don't now read the &s;criptures meerly as the writings of apo&s;tles, or prophets, but as the writings of God; and God

as truly appears to them in the&s;e writings, as tho' he &s;pake the things that are here wrote. And herein the per&s;ua&s;ion of believers, that are in Chri&s;t, differs from that of others, who are not. Others are per&s;uaded of the truth of chri&s;tianity, as the Mahomitans are per&s;uaded of the truth of the Alcoran: They were told it for truth by their fathers; it was &s;o handed down to them, by tradition: Or &s;hould their per&s;ua&s;ion be bet|ter grounded, as being the fruit of enquiry in|to the evidences upon which chri&s;tianity is e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, they may &s;till want that lively perception of God, as te&s;tifying to the truth of the go&s;pel, which is always the true rea&s;on of the faith of tho&s;e, who &s;hall be &s;aved. Perhaps, as Dr Owen repre&s;ents the matter, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I was at the pains, more than twenty years ago, to make a &s;ummary ab&s;tract of the Doctor's arguing up|on this point, as contained in a &s;hort treati&s;e of his, on "the authority or in&s;piration of the &s;criptures". It is in the following words. "The &s;acred &s;cripture carries with it its own evidence; and this, in &s;o clear and full a manner, that there is no need of any thing, be&s;ides the &s;cripture it&s;elf, to prove its divine original. It has &s;uch vi&s;ible &s;ignatures of a divine hand, that tis but looking into it, and we may be &s;ufficiently con|vinced, it had God for its author. Tis with the <HI>words of God,</HI> as with <HI>his works.</HI> There is no need of any foreign help, of any extraneous evidence, to prove that the <HI>works of God are his works.</HI> They carry along with them evident demon&s;trative marks of a divine hand. Tis but viewing them, and we may behold that in them, which will a&s;&s;ure us, they had God for their author. In like manner, it may &s;aid of the <HI>words of God</HI>; they carry along with them &s;uch evident traces of maje&s;ty, wi&s;dom, holine&s;s, ju&s;tice and goodne&s;s, that tis but con&s;idering them, and we &s;hall know they are not human, but divine. Not that all are able to &s;ee the marks of a divine hand in the holy &s;criptures. But then, this ari&s;es, not from their not being to be &s;een there; but from that igno|rance, with which "the god of this world has blinded men's minds"; as is &s;ometimes the ca&s;e, in regard of the <HI>works,</HI> as well as <HI>words</HI> of God. Some men have &s;o "darkened their hearts", that they can &s;ee nothing of God in any of his <HI>works,</HI> neither his wi&s;dom, nor power, nor goodne&s;s; tho' the&s;e things are &s;o plainly vi&s;ible, that tis, one would think impo&s;&s;ible, but they &s;hould be di&s;cerned by all: and the &s;ame perfections of God are &s;o fully manife&s;ted by his <HI>words,</HI> that if they can't be perceived, it mu&s;t be becau&s;e men have not eyes to &s;ee; or, "in &s;eeing, they will not perceive". The bible, wherever it goes, carries along with it, its own evidence. It has that in it, which will forever di&s;|criminate it from all human writings. So much of God is vi&s;ible in it, that whoever reads it, and is free from prejudice and pa&s;&s;ion, will and mu&s;t own it to <HI>be of God.</HI> As God, when he created the world, and the things that are therein, left &s;uch characters of "eternal power, and God-head" on them, as evidently point out their author; and &s;o &s;uited them to &s;trik conviction into the minds of all rational creatures, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hat, without any other te&s;timony from him&s;elf, or any thing el&s;e, under the naked con&s;ideration of what they are, they fully declare their creator; in&s;omuch that they are wholly without excu&s;e, who will not learn and know him from thence: So in giving out his <HI>word</HI> to be the ba&s;is of the new creation, he has, by his &s;pirit, implan|ted in it, and impre&s;&s;ed on it, &s;uch evident marks of the glories of his nature, that, without any other wit|ne&s;s, it declares it&s;elf, at all times, and in all places, to be his, and &s;o makes good its own divine authori|ty, as that the refu&s;al of it, upon <HI>its own evidence,</HI> brings unavoidable condemnation on the &s;ouls of men". This rea&s;oning of the Doctor will not appear triffling to con&s;iderate, well-di&s;po&s;ed per&s;ons. Per|haps, the more clo&s;ely it is attended to, the better fitted it will be found to &s;trike the mind with conviction. It perfectly falls in with the experience of tho&s;e, who are "believers unto life". They behold the &s;criptures in this light.</NOTE> God has impre&s;&s;ed on

<P><PB N="98" REF="009925_0103_0F7B38E133095690">THE next property of this per&s;ua&s;ion, which is connected with life, re&s;pects the "object believ|ed". And this appears in a peculiar light. Some, it may be, before they were the &s;ubjects of this per&s;ua&s;ion, had, by the help of rea&s;on and reve|lation, formed conceptions of the attributes of God that were right and ju&s;t; and had been led al&s;o into &s;entiments concerning the mediatorial undertaking of Chri&s;t, and the &s;everal offices he has &s;u&s;tained and executed as redeemer, that had no e&s;&s;ential mixture of fal&s;ehood with them. Tho&s;e, who&s;e belief of the go&s;pel is not ju&s;tify|ing, may yet be men of con&s;iderable attainments in chri&s;tian knowledge. They may be well ac|quainted with the doctrines of faith, and embrace them in their &s;implicity, as "once delivered to the &s;aints", at lea&s;t without con&s;truing them in a &s;en&s;e de&s;tructive of their real meaning. Doubtle&s;s, many among the ju&s;tified, before their being en|dowed with the faith by which they were ju&s;ti|fied,

were per&s;ons of this character. But they did not, till they were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this faith, ap|prehend the&s;e truths as they do now. They were then matters of &s;peculative opinion, rather than &s;olid belief; but now, they have a real and lively exi&s;tence in them. Light has &s;hone into their minds, and ca&s;t &s;uch a lu&s;tre on the&s;e truths, that they &s;ee them in their divinity, glory, and con&s;tituted connection with men's everla&s;ting well or ill being. They don't now entertain them in their tho'ts, as matters of &s;cience only, but truths of the neare&s;t and mo&s;t &s;olemn concern. They are ready to wonder they could be &s;o little influenced by them, they have now &s;o clear and full a view of their certain reality, and infinite importance: Or if their perception of the&s;e truths awakened their fears, or rai&s;ed their hopes, or put them upon religious endeavours, they were not &s;uch as gave them, what the &s;cripture calls, a "&s;piritual di&s;cerning of &s;piritual things".</P>
<P>AND this perception of go&s;pel-truths is, per|haps, the chief thing intended by that "illumi|nation of the &s;pirit", on account of which &s;inners are &s;aid, in the new-te&s;tament, to have their "un|der&s;tandings enlightened", their "eyes opened"; to be "turned from darkne&s;s to light", and the like.</P>
<P>THOSE indeed who were in heatheni&s;h dark|ne&s;s, when the go&s;pel was fir&s;t preached to them, (as was the ca&s;e of the greate&s;t part of the world, in the apo&s;tles days) might p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">operly enough be &s;aid to be "of the day, and not of the night", as the truths of the chri&s;tian religion, which they were before totally ignorant of, were now exter|nally

revealed to them. They might well be amazed to think of their former ignorance, in compari&s;on with their pre&s;ent knowledge; and tho&s;e who were thus "darkne&s;s", <HI>might,</HI> without a figure, be &s;aid to be "light in the Lord"; yea, to be "called out of darkne&s;s into marvellous light". But &s;till, in regard even of the&s;e hea|then, the truths of the go&s;pel, however manife&s;t|ed externally to them, were in&s;ufficient to their being "transformed by the renewing of their mind", but by their being accompanied with an internal influence of the &s;pirit, whereby their eyes were opened to &s;ee them in &s;uch a light as to convince their con&s;ciences, affect their hearts, a|waken their powers, and become a powerful prin|ciple of action in them.</P>
<P>AND this is that influence of the &s;pirit which is now principally needed, and wherein principally con&s;i&s;ts his work in enlightening the minds of &s;inners. It does not lie, as &s;ome may be ready to imagine, in giving them new revelations, in &s;ugge&s;ting to their tho'ts new truths, which the world knew nothing of before; but in &s;etting tho&s;e old truths, which are contained in that pub|lic, &s;tanding, authentic revelation of the divine mind, the holy bible, before their view, in &s;uch a convincing commanding light, as that they &s;ee them in their reality, and importance, and &s;o as to be powerfully excited by them. Thus it is with all ju&s;tified believers. They &s;ee the truth in this divine and &s;piritual light; which is not the ca&s;e with others, who&s;e faith comes &s;hort of that which is &s;aving.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="009925_0106_0F7B38E34001EC30">THE la&s;t property of this ju&s;tifying per&s;ua&s;ion re&s;pects its "influence," or "operation".<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Our author &s;ays, page 301. "the que&s;tion about faith mu&s;t be &s;et a&s;ide, where the inquiry turns upon, how a man is affected by a te&s;timony of what he believes"? Tis undoubtedly true, the effects of faith are not faith; and to move a que&s;tion that would turn upon this point, would be to a&s;k, whether the effect and the cau&s;e are the &s;ame thing? Which would be to invert the order of nature. But &s;till, it may be highly proper to inquire, how a man is affected by his faith? And this, in order to his knowing whether his faith is &s;aving. He cannot indeed, in any other way, attain to this knowledge. Our author very ju&s;tly ob&s;erves page 303. "that a difference often takes place between the con|fe&s;&s;ion of the mouth, and the belief of the heart, which time only can di&s;cover". He &s;ays again p. ibid. "what a man believes in his heart, will certainly influence his conduct in life. God bare witne&s;s to the apo&s;tles, as having unfeigned faith as influenced by the &s;pirit of it in their lives". It may therefore be affirmed, with the permi&s;&s;ion of this author, if he will be con&s;i&s;tent with him&s;elf, that that belief of the go&s;pel-report will not &s;ave a man, which will not influence his conduct in life. How then is it "to &s;et a&s;ide the que&s;tion about faith" to inquire, how a man is affected by what he believes? Mu&s;t he not thus inquire, if he would, up|on &s;olid grounds, be &s;atisfied, that his faith is unfeign|edly that, which the &s;cripture connects with the ju&s;tifi|cation of life? His faith may be this &s;aving one in the view of God, as it lies a naked per&s;ua&s;ion in his mind; but it mu&s;t &s;hew it&s;elf to be &s;uch by its effects, or the man him&s;elf can't ju&s;tly entertain this tho't of it. In de&s;cribing the faith therefore that is &s;aving, tis really nece&s;&s;ary to &s;peak of it, not only as a per|&s;ua&s;ion of the truth, but &s;uch a per&s;ua&s;ion of it as will &s;hew it&s;elf in works. This is the grand criterion of its nature as &s;aving; by this it is di&s;tingui&s;hed from all counterfeits. It is the root, &s;eed, or fir&s;t princi|ple, from whence proceeds all that a man ever is, as a chri&s;tian, in deed and in truth; and it ought therefore to be repre&s;ented, not meerly as a per&s;ua&s;ion of go&s;pel-truth, but a per&s;ua&s;ion of this &s;ort or kind.</NOTE> And
<PB N="102" REF="009925_0107_0F7B38E59AC70AA0">
this is of &s;uch a nature, as that the man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it will be quite altered from what he was. A new being is, as it were, given to him. He is furni&s;hed with new &s;prings of motion and action. He has that within him, which, with the concur|ing influence of the Spirit, always in readine&s;s to be afforded to him, will change the bent of his heart, give a new turn to his affections, and di&s;|po&s;e him to walk in newne&s;s of life. Nor will it fail of producing the&s;e effects. His faith in|deed is, &s;eminally and virtually, the "new man in Chri&s;t"; the "workman&s;hip of God, created again to good works". It is, in embrio, the "go&s;pel penitent"; the "chri&s;tian convert"; the "new-born creature"; the &s;inner "quickened, who was dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins"; the man "transformed by the renewing of the Holy Gho&s;t", &s;o as to be not "conformed to this evil world". It is, in one word, every thing in the root, prin|ciple, and fir&s;t beginning, that is any where con|nected, in the bible, with that eternal life, which is the great promi&s;e of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>IT may accordingly be ob&s;erved, this account of that per&s;ua&s;ion of the truth, which is connected with &s;alvation, perfectly coincides with the de&s;crip|tions that are frequently given of it in the &s;acred &s;criptures.

<P>IT will, perhaps, more &s;trikingly, and at the &s;ame time more familiarly, convey to you an idea of this per&s;ua&s;ion of mind, as a principle of the powerful influence we have de&s;cribed, &s;hould it be exemplified to you by &s;ome &s;ignal in&s;tances. The fir&s;t I would mention &s;hall be that of ABRA|HAM. And I the rather chu&s;e to begin with him, becau&s;e he is repre&s;ented by the apo&s;tle Paul, <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Rom. 4.11, 12.</NOTE> as "the father of all that believe", whe|ther under the jewi&s;h or chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation; that is, their father, &s;o as that they mu&s;t re&s;em|ble him in faith, in order to its being "imputed to them al&s;o for righteou&s;ne&s;s".</P>
<P>AND what is the idea the &s;cripture gives us of the faith of Abraham? Evidently this, that it was a practical principle, or, in other words, &s;uch
<PB N="104" REF="009925_0109_0F7B38E78EF711E8">
a per&s;ua&s;ion of the exi&s;tence, perfections, moral government and revelations of God, as di&s;po&s;ed and influenced him to honor the divine authori|ty, by chearfully complying with its commands, wherein they were made known, whatever diffi|culty might attend an obedient regard to them; illu&s;trious patterns of which are &s;et before our view, by the &s;acred pen-men.</P>
<P>HE received a command from heaven, in tho&s;e words, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. 12.1, 2.</NOTE> "get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's hou&s;e, unto a land which I will &s;hew thee. And I will make thee a great nation, and will ble&s;s thee, and thou &s;halt be a ble&s;&s;ing". Great things, it is acknow|ledged, were promi&s;ed to engage his obedience to the heavenly call; but &s;till he mu&s;t quit his country, for&s;ake his friends &amp; relatives, yea, and leave his father's hou&s;e, that he might go whither he knew not. We can't make his ca&s;e our own, and not perceive the difficulty of the tryal he was now put to. And what was the re&s;ult? Why, his faith in God inclined and enabled him to a ready &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the divine plea&s;ure. So we read, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heb. 11.8.</NOTE> "by faith Abraham, when he was called to go out unto a place, which he &s;hould after|ward receive for an inheritance, obeyed".</P>
<P>A LIKE, but far more &s;evere, command was that, <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gen. 22.2.</NOTE> "take now thy &s;on, thine only &s;on I&s;aac whom thou love&s;t, and get thee into the land of Moriah, and offer him there for a burnt-offering, upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of". What an amazing gradation is this! It &s;eems calculated, in its manner of delivery, to engage
<PB N="105" REF="009925_0110_0F7B38E7C58E9F68">
all the &s;ofter pa&s;&s;ions of the human mind, again&s;t a complyance with it. It mu&s;t be "his &s;on", his own fle&s;h and blood, him&s;elf exi&s;ting in the per|&s;on of his offspring. It mu&s;t be his "only &s;on I&s;aac". There is a &s;ingular empha&s;is in this. For "I&s;aac" was the &s;on given him in his old-age, beyond the ordinary cour&s;e of nature, and in ful|fillment of a divine promi&s;e. And it was this &s;on in &s;pecial, this &s;on only, thro' whom "his &s;eed", according to the expre&s;s word of God, "could be reckoned". This "&s;on I&s;aac" might well be the delight of his heart, the deare&s;t to him of any object in this world. Tis therefore &s;aid, "thine only &s;on I&s;aac whom thou love&s;t". And what was he to do with this &s;on of his love? It follows, "get thee into the land of Moriah, and offer him there for a burnt-offering". A mo&s;t extraordinary command! God never before called Abraham to &s;o &s;evere a tryal, and the like he has never &s;ince put any other man to. Twas not eno' that he mu&s;t part with this &s;on by death; twas not eno' that he mu&s;t part with him in a bloody manner: But he mu&s;t, in his own per&s;on, with his own hands, "&s;lay him for a &s;acrifice to the Lord"; yea, and after he had &s;lain him, he mu&s;t con&s;ume his body in the fire": Otherwi&s;e he could not have offered him for a "burnt-offer|ing", according to the command he had received from God. Let any man that is a father look within, and attend to the working of his own bowels, and this will tell him, beyond all lan|guage, the dreadful &s;everity of the &s;ervice Abra|ham was now called to. And what was the ef|fect? The account of it is given in the&s;e words,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ver. 3.</NOTE> "and Abraham ro&s;e up early in the morning,

and took I&s;aac his &s;on, and went to the place of which God had told him". Far from di&s;puting the will of God, he was in&s;tant in his obedience to it. He did not make excu&s;es, a variety of which were ready at hand; he did not put off the matter for the pre&s;ent; but takes the fir&s;t opportunity to fulfill the divine plea&s;ure. What a miracle of &s;elf-denied obedience was this! The ble&s;&s;ed God tho't fit to &s;ignifie his &s;pecial appro|bation of it, in tho&s;e words, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ver. 12.</NOTE> "I know that thou feare&s;t God, &s;eeing thou ha&s;t not with-held thy &s;on, thine only &s;on, from me". Now, all this reverence of the divine maje&s;ty, all this &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the divine government, was the fruit of faith. So we are taught to think of the matter, by the author of the epi&s;tle to the Hebrews. Says he, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chap. 11. ver. 17.</NOTE> "by faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up I&s;aac; and he that had received the promi&s;es, offered up his only begotten &s;on". To the like purpo&s;e, the apo&s;tle James, refering to this &s;ame affair of Abraham's "offering his &s;on I&s;aac upon the altar", makes that appeal, <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chap. ver. 22.</NOTE> "&s;ee&s;t thou how faith wro't with his works"? And its thus ope|rating, gave abundant proof, that it was a practi|cal principle, a per&s;ua&s;ion of &s;oul that powerfully influenced his whole inner and outer man.</P>
<P>SUCH was the faith of Abraham, that faith of his which was "counted to him for righteou&s;|ne&s;s". And it was the &s;ame kind of faith that was "counted" to his po&s;terity, under the Mo&s;aic di&s;pen&s;ation, "for righteou&s;ne&s;s" al&s;o. They could not have been believers, &s;o as that their faith would have been connected with ju&s;tification, un|le&s;s,
<PB N="107" REF="009925_0112_0F7B38E9BB514998">
like the faith of their father Abraham, it had been a powerful principle, habitually influencing their hearts and lives. For, as the apo&s;tle Paul ob&s;erves, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. 4.11.</NOTE> they only who "walked in the &s;teps of the faith of their father Abraham," could have "faith imputed to them for righteou&s;ne&s;s", as he had. Not that all&punc; under the law, who were in a &s;tate of ju&s;tification, as Abraham was, kept pace with him in his "walk of faith": But they were all, in a mea&s;ure, followers of him in the &s;ame way of faith. They all trod in his &s;teps, tho' not with equal exactne&s;s. To &s;peak plainly, they were all, like him, the &s;ubjects of an active faith; a faith that was an abiding principle, di&s;|po&s;ing and enabling them, as occa&s;ions were offer|ed therefor in providence, to like exerci&s;es of love to God, dependance on him, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his all-wi&s;e plea&s;ure, and obedience to his righ|teous commands; tho' not in the &s;ame emi|nent degree: Nor could they otherwi&s;e have been "of faith", &s;o as to be "ble&s;&s;ed with faith|ful Abraham". <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gal. 3.11.</NOTE> They could not have been his children, in the &s;piritual &s;en&s;e; for as our Savior ob&s;erved to them, <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Joh. 8.39.</NOTE> "if ye were Abraham's children, then would ye do the works of Abra|ham".</P>
<P>AND it was by this &s;ame faith, I have been de|&s;cribing, that all the Patriarchs, even from Adam to Abraham, were ju&s;tified and &s;aved. The wri|ter of the epi&s;tle to the Hebrews, has put this beyond all doubt.</P>
<P>SAYS he of Abel, one of the &s;ons of Adam, <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Gen. 11.4.</NOTE> "by faith he offered unto God a more excellent

&s;acrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witne&s;s that he was righteous, God te&s;tifying of his gifts". He believed in God, and, it may be, in the pro|mi&s;e of God, that "the &s;eed of the woman &s;hould brui&s;e the &s;erpent's head". And it was under the influence of this per&s;ua&s;ion, that he made choice of "the fatlings of his flock, and the fat thereof"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. 4.4.</NOTE> to offer in &s;acrifice to God; and when he offered the &s;acrifice, this &s;ame per&s;ua&s;ion put him upon yielding to God, together with the external offer|ing, the inward homage and devotion of his &s;oul, and, at the &s;ame time, his intire tru&s;t in the divine mercy for acceptance. It was owing to this faith of Abel, &s;hewing it&s;elf by works, that he "offer|ed a more excellent &s;acrifice than Cain", and "by it he obtained witne&s;s that he was righteous, God te&s;tifying of his gifts".</P>
<P>IN like manner, tis ob&s;erved of Enoch, the &s;e|venth from Adam, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 5.</NOTE> that "by faith he was tran&s;|lated, that he &s;hould not &s;ee death"; that is, by faith that was a powerful principle of action. For it wro't both on his heart and life, and in an un|common degree; making him an extraordinary in&s;tance of piety towards God, and righteou&s;ne&s;s and goodne&s;s towards men. Mo&s;es declares con|cerning him, <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gen. 5. 21, 22.</NOTE> that he "began early to walk with God", and that he "went on walking with him for three hundred years together". And it ap|pears, from the epi&s;tle to the Hebrews, that this was the fruit of a firm and un&s;haken faith. Both his entrance on a religious cour&s;e of life at fir&s;t, and his afterwards going on in it for &s;o long a &s;pace of time, was owing to his faith. This was the ruling principle of his life. In con&s;equence

of this faith, "he had, before his tran&s;lation, this te&s;timony, that he plea&s;ed God", and "by it" he was di&s;tingui&s;ht from the re&s;t of mankind, by being taken to the other world, without pa&s;&s;ing thro' death.</P>
<P>AND it was by the &s;ame kind of faith that Noah al&s;o, an antediluvian Patriarch "became heir of the righteou&s;ne&s;s which is by faith". <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. 11.7.</NOTE> He not only gave credit to the notice God had given him of an approaching deluge; he not only lookt up|on this event, tho' in futurity at pre&s;ent, and greatly di&s;tant too, as what would certainly, in time, be the truth of fact; but his faith, in this revealed truth, was an inward, powerful &s;pring of action. It had a ju&s;t and rea&s;onable influence both on his mind, and on his conduct. For, &s;ays the &s;cripture, "by faith, being warned of God, of things not &s;een as yet," he was "moved with fear", and &s;et him&s;elf "to prepare an ark".</P>
<P>HIS faith wro't upon his "fear". Not that he was in anxiety, le&s;t he &s;hould be involved in the general de&s;truction by water; for the &s;ame revelation that a&s;&s;ured him of this amazing judi|cial procedure of God, a&s;&s;ured him likewi&s;e that he &s;hould &s;uffer no harm by it. But his faith in God's re&s;olution to drown the world, awaken'd in him an holy awe of the divine ju&s;tice, holine&s;s and power, and &s;uch a reverential regard to the authority and government of God, as was a migh|ty re&s;traint to him from &s;in, and a powerful in|centive prompting him to the di&s;charge of duty and particularly that branch of it, "the building an ark", as God had commanded. The apo&s;tle

therefore ob&s;erves, after having &s;aid, "Noah was moved with fear", that he "prepared an ark for the &s;aving of his hou&s;e". He was &s;o per&s;waded of the truth of what God had &s;aid, notwith&s;tand|ing the contrary appearances of &s;econd cau&s;es, notwith&s;tanding the improbabilities ari&s;ing from the unlikelyhood of the thing in it&s;elf con&s;idered, that he began upon the work of "building the ark"; and he went on &s;teadily, and in an uniform cour&s;e, notwith&s;tanding the univer&s;al infidelity of the age in which he lived, and the ridicule of ma|ny an unbelieving &s;coffer, till he had fini&s;hed it; evidencing the reality and greatne&s;s of his faith by his punctual obedience to the will and plea|&s;ure of God. Such was the faith "by which he became heir of the righteou&s;ne&s;s which is by faith".</P>
<P>IN fine, it was this &s;ame kind of faith, that was "reckoned" to even Mo&s;es, the founder of the jew|i&s;h law, "for righteou&s;ne&s;s". For the faith he was happily the &s;ubject of inclined &amp; enabled him to prefer an "afflicted &s;tate with the people of God", before the honors and plea&s;ures of "Pharoah's court". <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. 11.25.</NOTE> It carried his views beyond this pre|&s;ent world, to the coming "recompence of re|ward", and influenced him to "e&s;teem the re|proach of Chri&s;t, greater riches than the trea&s;ures of Egypt". In a word, it was a per&s;ua&s;ion of &s;oul, that was &s;ufficiently powerful to take off his "af|fections from things on the earth", &amp; to fix them "on things that are above", and to engage him in a &s;teady care to approve him&s;elf, in his whole conduct, to the will of him, who is the &s;upreme "law-giver, king and judge".</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="009925_0116_0F7B38EF266DC8A8">YOU have now &s;een, that the faith of Abra|ham, and tho&s;e antient worthies, who lived and died in favour with God, was an inward, power|ful &s;pring of right affection, and right conduct, towards God and Man.

Our faith in God, and Chri&s;t, and the great truths revealed in the go&s;pel, mu&s;t have a governing influence on our hearts, and whole external behaviour of our&s;elves in the world. It mu&s;t "work by love", love to God, and Chri&s;t, and one another. It mu&s;t "&s;hew it&s;elf in works", in works of piety, in works of righteou&s;ne&s;s, in works of &s;obriety.

<P>NOR unle&s;s we explain this per&s;ua&s;ion of &s;oul, as thus virtually comprehending in it the whole chri&s;tian character, can it be the faith, in con&s;e|quence of which, a man may, with truth, be de|nominated a ju&s;tified believer. For it is to be re|membered, the ju&s;tified per&s;on is a pardoned one, if we may believe the apo&s;tle Paul, who introduces David, when de&s;cribing "the ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of the man to whom God imputeth righteou&s;ne&s;s with|out works", as &s;aying, "ble&s;&s;ed are they who&s;e iniquities are forgiven, and who&s;e &s;ins are covered.

<P>IN this view of the faith, that is connected with ju&s;tification, beauty, &s;trength and harmony, run thro' the whole new te&s;tament-writings, with re|ference to this important affair: Whereas, if we explain it in any other oppo&s;ite &s;en&s;e, we &s;hall make them perplext, I may &s;ay unintelligible, if not &s;elf-contradictory.</P>

But &s;uch a method of conduct is of no &s;ervice to reli|gion, or the &s;ouls of men; but a great hurt to both. If we keep more clo&s;ely to the &s;cripture, and pay le&s;s regard to metaphy&s;ical niceties, our notion of faith will not be involved in difficulty, nor &s;hall we be puzzled to under&s;tand that, which is &s;o clo&s;ely connected with our eternal well-being in the coming world. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It will, probably, be tho't by &s;ome, that I have been greatly deficient in not making the <HI>e&s;&s;ence</HI> of faith, as ju&s;tifying, to con&s;i&s;t in the &s;oul's relyance on Chri&s;t, or tru&s;ting in his righteou&s;ne&s;s, as the only pleadable title to life. This, with them, is the principal thing the &s;cripture means by the faith that ju&s;tifies. In an|&s;wer whereto I would &s;ay, I know of no text, in all the bible, that gives this idea of faith; and there is this good rea&s;on to think, there is no &s;uch text, namely, that tru&s;t in Chri&s;t, relyance on his righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, is always con&s;equent upon faith, and a fruit of it, as truly as love, repentance, humility, or any other chri&s;tian grace. Wherever there is faith, there will be this tru&s;t. They are in&s;eperable from each other. But then, this tru&s;t mu&s;t be con&s;idered, not as faith it&s;elf, but the effect of faith. And, in truth, how &s;hould a man tru&s;t in Chri&s;t for righteou&s;ne&s;s, before he believes he has wro't out an all-&s;ufficient righteou&s;ne&s;s for &s;inners? If he fir&s;t believes in Chri&s;t, as having "fini&s;hed tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and bro't in an ever|la&s;ting righteou&s;ne&s;s", he may, in con&s;equence of this faith, place his intire tru&s;t in him. His relyance on Chri&s;t, and the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, as con&s;equent upon faith, and one of its fruits, is perfectly agreeable to the order of nature; otherwi&s;e, an inver&s;ion of this order. Tis indeed impo&s;&s;ible, a rea&s;onable creature, acting rea&s;onably, &s;hould tru&s;t in Chri&s;t for righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, till he is fir&s;t per&s;uaded, upon the te&s;timony of God, that there is &s;uch a righteou&s;ne&s;s to tru&s;t in him for. Having faith in this righteou&s;ne&s;s, he may now place his intire dependance on it.

<P N="1">I. TIS quite ea&s;y to collect, from the account we have given of faith, that there is no contradiction, not the lea&s;t incon&s;i&s;tency, between the apo&s;tles, Paul and James, wherein they may &s;eem to oppo&s;e each other, with re&s;pect to the affair of ju&s;tification. The apo&s;tle Paul &s;ays, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. 3.28.</NOTE> "a man is ju&s;tified by faith, without the deeds (or works) of the law". The apo&s;tle James &s;ays, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chap. 2. ver. 24.</NOTE> "by works (or deeds) a man is ju&s;tified, and not by faith only". The apo&s;tle Paul &s;ays again, <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. 4.2.</NOTE> "Abraham was not ju&s;tified by works". The apo&s;tle James &s;ays, <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Chap. 2. ver. 21.</NOTE> "Abraham was ju&s;ti|fied by works". This &s;eeming contradiction be|tween the&s;e apo&s;tles, has &s;trangely puzzled expo&s;i|tors, and other chri&s;tian writers; many of whom have rather left their readers in confu&s;ion, than &s;atis|faction, notwith&s;tanding their learned and labori|ous di&s;qui&s;itions. It does not appear to me, to require any great degree of attention, to perceive, that the&s;e apo&s;tles were perfectly of the &s;ame mind, and &s;pake preci&s;ely the &s;ame thing, how|ever
<PB N="116" REF="009925_0121_0F7B38F30B26F330">
it may look, at the fir&s;t glance, as tho' they differed, not only in words, but in &s;entiment.</P>
<P>WHEN the apo&s;tle Paul &s;ays, "we are ju&s;tified by faith without works", he can't be &s;uppo&s;ed to mean, that we are ju&s;tified by a faith that will not be productive of works. Should we put &s;uch an interpretation on his words, we &s;hould make him contradict him&s;elf. For he el&s;ewhere affirms of the faith that ju&s;tifies, that it will "work by love", both to God and man; that is, in other words, that it will &s;hew it&s;elf by works. When the a|po&s;tle James &s;ays, on the other hand, "a man is ju&s;tified by works, and not by faith only", the idea he would communicate, is evidently this, that we are ju&s;tified, not by a "dead faith", but a faith that will be the &s;ource of evangelically good works. For this was the point he had in view to prove; and he accordingly illu&s;trates it by leting us know, that a "dead faith", a faith that is not followed "by works", would be of no more profit in the bui&s;ine&s;s of ju&s;tification, than good words would be to an "hungry and naked man", while we afforded him "no charitable relief". Hitherto the&s;e apo&s;tles, in&s;tead of contradicting, perfectly agree with each other, and indeed with all the &s;acred writers.</P>
<P>BUT the apo&s;tle James &s;ays, "Abraham was ju&s;tified by works"; whereas the apo&s;tle Paul &s;ays, "he was not ju&s;tified by works". Neither is there any contradiction between them here, un|le&s;s we attend to the found only of their words, and not the ideas intended to be conveyed by them. When the apo&s;tle Paul &s;ays, "Abraham was not ju&s;tified by works", what he intends is,
<PB N="117" REF="009925_0122_0F7B38F3C08FEFA8">
that he was not ju&s;tified upon the &s;core of works, in con&s;ideration of any thing he had done in con|formity to the divine law: In which &s;en&s;e, no man, any more than Abraham, was ever yet ju&s;ti|fied, or ever will be. And is he herein contra|dicted by the apo&s;tle James? Can it be &s;uppo&s;ed, when this apo&s;tle &s;ays, "Abraham was ju&s;tified by works", that he de&s;igned to affirm, that it was upon a plea grounded on their agreement with the law, as the rule of judgment? Had he meant to declare this, he mu&s;t have bewrayed ignorance of the whole go&s;pel-&s;cheme of redemption; yea, he mu&s;t, in true con&s;truction, have "made void the death of Chri&s;t". And yet, he mu&s;t be in|terpreted to mean this, to make out a contra|diction between him, and the apo&s;tle Paul. The exact truth is, the apo&s;tle James, in &s;aying, that "Abraham was ju&s;tified by works", really intends nothing more nor le&s;s, than this, that he was ju&s;ti|fied by a faith that was not "dead", but "&s;hew|ed it&s;elf by works". And herein he perfectly coincides with the apo&s;tle Paul, who&s;e doctrine, upon this head, is preci&s;ely the &s;ame.</P>
<P>IT may be worthy of &s;pecial remark here, both the apo&s;tles, Paul and James, argue from the ca&s;e of Abraham, in proof of the points they re&s;pect|ively had in view. And, by briefly con&s;idering what they &s;ay upon it, we &s;hall ea&s;ily be con|vinced, that their &s;entiments, upon the affair of ju&s;tification, were exactly the &s;ame.</P>
<P>THE apo&s;tle Paul proves, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. 4.2, 3.</NOTE> that "Abraham was not ju&s;tified by works", from that &s;cripture-declaration, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gen. 15.6.</NOTE> "Abraham believed God, and it
<PB N="118" REF="009925_0123_0F7B38F5D56A2998">
was counted to him for righteou&s;ne&s;s". As if he had &s;aid, &s;o far is it from being true, that Abraham was ju&s;tified for his works, upon the account of his good deeds, that the way in which he was ju&s;tified, was this; "he believed God", and God was plea&s;ed, upon the plan of grace thro' Chri&s;t, to accept of him as righteous. But then, it ought to be particularly rememered here, this faith, which was "counted to Abraham for righ|teou&s;ne&s;s", was not a "dead faith", but a "work|ing" one; that is to &s;ay, it was &s;uch a per&s;ua&s;ion concerning God, and the revelations of God, as was a powerful &s;pring of obedience to him, an inward principle that di&s;po&s;ed and enabled him to do, or &s;uffer, any thing at the divine call. Abra|ham was in fact the &s;ubject of &s;uch a faith as this; and this faith, thus influencing his heart, and op|erating in his life, was the very faith that God, in grace or favor, "counted to him for righte|ou&s;ne&s;s".</P>
<P>AND this is the very thing meant by the apo&s;tle James, when he &s;ays, "Abraham was ju&s;tified by works". He did not intend to &s;ugge&s;t, by the&s;e words, (as he mu&s;t have done to contradict the apo|&s;tle Paul) that "law" was the rule of Abraham's ju&s;tification, and that he was accordingly "ju&s;ti|fied by works", in conformity to this rule. No|thing could be more di&s;tant from his de&s;ign, thro' the whole cour&s;e of his rea&s;oning, in this chapter. He had been treating of "the faith" by which men, upon the go&s;pel-plan of mercy thro' Chri&s;t, are &s;aved, and &s;hewing that it was not an empty "dead faith", but a faith that di&s;covered its rea|lity in "works" of evangelical obedience. And, in order to illu&s;trate this great point he had in
<PB N="119" REF="009925_0124_0F7B38F65F5FD088">
view, he introduces the ca&s;e of Abraham, and &s;ays, ver. 21. "he was ju&s;tified by works"; that is, by a "working faith", not a fruitle&s;s one; by a faith that was not "dead" and "alone", but a|live, and accompanied with "<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">", in confor|mity to the divine will. The c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ection of the&s;e words, with the argument he is pur&s;uing, evident|ly determines this to be his meaning, and that he could have no other. And, that we may be con|vinced of it, I &s;hall place before your view, the whole paragraph here relating to Abraham. It &s;tands thus, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ver. 21, 22, 23, 24.</NOTE> "Was not Abraham our father ju&s;tified by works, when he offered I&s;aac his &s;on upon the altar? See&s;t thou how faith wro't with his works, and by works was faith made perfect? And the &s;cripture was fulfilled, which &s;aith, Abra|ham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteou&s;ne&s;s; and he was called the friend of God. Ye &s;ee then how by works a man is ju&s;ti|fied, and not by faith only". As if he had &s;aid, I have been &s;hewing you, that an empty faith, a faith that is "dead", and "alone", not operating in "works" of obedience to the go&s;pel, will never avail a man to &s;alvation. Let me illu&s;trate this important point, by bringing your view to the ca&s;e of Abraham, our father, according to the fle&s;h. Was he ju&s;tified by a "dead faith", a faith that did not "&s;hew it&s;elf by works"? Is not his offer|ing I&s;aac his &s;on, upon the altar, a plain proof of the contrary? Don't you perceive, by this illu&s;tri|ous "work", evidencing his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive obedience to the plea&s;ure of almighty God, that his faith, in&s;tead of being "dead", "wro't together with works"? Don't you perceive, that his faith, by its not being "alone", but thus operating in
<PB N="120" REF="009925_0125_0F7B38F76756DCA0">
"works", was compleatly fited to the purpo&s;e of his ju&s;tification? Don't you perceive, in this way of his ju&s;tification, thro' an operative faith, the fulfillment of that text of &s;cripture, which &s;ays, "Abraham believed God", and his "faith" in God, thus &s;hewing it&s;elf in "works" of obedience and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his governing authority, was "counted to him for righteou&s;ne&s;s", in con&s;e|quence whereof, he "became the friend of God"? You may then, my brethren, both ea&s;ily and plainly &s;ee, in this example of Abraham, I have &s;et before you, that "a man is ju&s;tified, not by faith only", not by a faith that is "dead", and "alone"; but by a faith that &s;hews it&s;elf in "works" of obedience, as occa&s;ions are offered therefor, in the providential government of God.</P>
<P>THIS explanation of the apo&s;tle James makes out a connection, and con&s;i&s;tency, in his whole di&s;cour&s;e, upon this head of faith and ju&s;tification. Upon this plan of interpretation, it runs &s;mooth and ea&s;y, and appears to be &s;trongly put toge|ther. And, taking this to be his &s;en&s;e, (as it un|que&s;tionably is) wherein does he differ from the apo&s;tle Paul? Far from contradicting what he &s;ays, he really means the &s;ame thing: Nor can his words be under&s;tood, &s;o as to oppo&s;e the a|po&s;tle Paul, unle&s;s they are interpreted in a &s;en&s;e that will de&s;troy the coherence of his di&s;cour&s;e, and make him a loo&s;e, weak and unconnected writer; which would be far from reflecting honor on him.</P>
<P>IT will, probably, be objected again&s;t this re|conciliation of the&s;e apo&s;tles, and indeed again&s;t the idea I have given of faith, that they &s;et up
<PB N="121" REF="009925_0126_0F7B38F7A39AE610">
"works" in the affair of ju&s;tification; for if we are ju&s;tified by faith, and faith i a work, we are then ju&s;tified by "a work of our own", and not by "the work of Chri&s;t". We &s;hall &s;ee at large, in the next di&s;cour&s;e, that this objection is a meer pretence, having no real &s;olidity in it. However, I would &s;o far prevent my&s;elf, as to &s;ay at pre|&s;ent; tho', in&s;tead of denying faith to be a work, I avow it to be one, yet I utterly deny, at the &s;ame time, that it is a work, in the &s;en&s;e in which works are any where, in the bible, excluded from ju&s;tification.</P>
<P>THAT faith &s;hould be viewed as a work, in the affair of the &s;inner's ju&s;tification, is vehemently oppo&s;ed by &s;ome; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Our author will tell us, that faith, in this view of it, is not "a work", but a meer "pa&s;&s;ive reception of the truth", in which there is no labor, not the lea&s;t activity of the human mind.

form? It would be highly ab&s;urd to make him &s;peak thus; e&s;pecially, as he has him&s;elf taught us to look upon faith, as "a required work", in tho&s;e words of his, in an&s;wer to a que&s;tion that was put to him by &s;ome of the Jews, "this is the work of God", the work God commands you to do, "that ye believe in him whom he hath &s;ent", John 6. 28. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Our author &s;ays upon this text, pag. 369. "The Jews were plainly inquiring, how they might be qua|lified to do the works God requires, in his law, in order to ju&s;tification. The an&s;wer of Je&s;us plainly imports, that they would be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the whole work God required, in knowing that God &s;ent him to work it, without their working more or le&s;s". It is allowed, Je&s;us was &s;ent to work the whole work that God required as the <HI>con&s;ideration</HI> upon which, that in the <HI>virtue</HI> of which, the &s;inner is ju&s;tified, "without his working more or le&s;s", in this view of working. But &s;till, the que&s;tion recurs with as much force as ever, did not Chri&s;t require the&s;e Jews to believe that God had &s;ent him thus to work? If he did, as the words directly affirm that he did, there is then &s;omething required, a duty commanded, with which they were obliged to comply. One can &s;carce read this text, and not be nece&s;&s;itated to think, that &s;ome work was here enjoined them. The Jews them&s;elves entertained this tho't of the matter. For they are introduced &s;till a&s;king, ver. 30. "what &s;ign &s;hewe&s;t thou, that we may &s;ee and believe thee? What do&s;t thou work"? That is, what evidence give&s;t thou of thy divine character, what miraculous work do&s;t thou do, that we may attend to it, and be per&s;uaded to believe that God &s;ent thee? Surely they imagined they had &s;omething to do, &s;ome work to perform, in con&s;equence of our Lord's direction: Nor can it be &s;uppo&s;ed, he would have directed them to the duty of believing in him, if no motion, action, or ex|erci&s;e of their &s;ouls were nece&s;&s;ary in order hereto; but the work was God's, to the exclu&s;ion of any exert|ments of their's, in any &s;ort or kind.</NOTE> Ob&s;ervable al&s;o to the

Do we believe in Je&s;us Chri&s;t? Our faith, if the authority of God is therein regarded, is a compliance with his com|mand, and, as &s;uch, "a work done", a duty per|formed, as truly as when we "love one another" in obedience to God, who has required us &s;o to do. It is not my bui&s;ine&s;s to inquire, at pre&s;ent, how we come by an ability to believe. Be this as it may. Whenever we do believe, if we therein have our eye to God (as we mu&s;t have, or our faith will be of no value) we pay religious honor to him, by doing a duty he has required of us; and, by thus doing a duty, we do that which is a work, and may, with as much propriety, be &s;o called, as any other act of obedience that we per|form. Nor can we indeed, as intelligent moral agents, believe in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, upon the te&s;timony of God, and in compliance with his command, but by the exerci&s;e of our rea&s;onable powers. The capital truth, comprehen&s;ive of the whole object of faith, is this, "Je&s;us, who is the Chri&s;t, died for our offences, and ro&s;e again for our ju&s;tifica|tion". I would hereupon a&s;k, can this truth ex|i&s;t in our minds, as a truth we give credit to, without the u&s;e of our intellectual capacities?

Mu&s;t we not know its ju&s;t im|port? that is, have in our minds di&s;tinct ideas of, at lea&s;t, all the e&s;&s;ential truths that are con|tained in it? Mu&s;t we not perceive the evidence upon which it comes te&s;tified to us? Mu&s;t we

not be &s;atisfied, that this evidence will ju&s;tifie us, as rea&s;onable creatures, in yeilding to it? In fine, mu&s;t we not have &s;uch a view of God, as, in our believing this truth, to do honor to his faithfull|ne&s;s and authority?

Nothing is more indub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tably clear and certain, than that faith partakes of all the properties of a work, and is as truly &s;uch, as love, humility, or any other chri&s;tian grace: Nor is it po&s;&s;ible it &s;hould be otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT then, it is utterly denied to be a work, in the &s;en&s;e in which works are excluded in the affair of ju&s;tification. For which rea&s;on there may be, and actually is, a perfect con&s;i&s;tency in &s;aying, that "no man can be ju&s;tified by works", and that "every man that is ju&s;tified is ju&s;tified by faith, which is a work"; becau&s;e faith, tho' a work, is not a work in that &s;en&s;e, in which works are excluded from ju&s;tification. It is an indi&s;|puted maxim, that, in explaining the &s;cripture, regard is always to be had to the MEANING of words, and not their meer &s;ound. Upon which, the que&s;tion is, what does the &s;cripture mean by "works", when it &s;ays, "no man can be ju&s;tified by works"? Look where you will, and you will always find, that it means works recured to as a title to ju&s;tification; works that ju&s;tifie in their own virtue; works that are the con&s;ideration up|on which ju&s;tification is claimed; works that are oppo&s;ed to grace and Chri&s;t, and depended on in&s;tead of the&s;e; in fine, works that give occa&s;ion for boa&s;ting in our&s;elves, rather than glorying in God thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t, when we are ju&s;tified.

This is the &s;cripture-meaning of works, when it declares, that "no fle&s;h can be ju&s;tified by them".<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In this view of works, tis ea&s;y to &s;ee there is no need to deny, that faith is a work, when we connect it with ju&s;tification. Nor will its being &s;poken of as a work, infer the lea&s;t incon&s;i&s;tency with tho&s;e words of the apo&s;tle Paul, which are bro't by our author to prove it to be &s;uch, "to him that worketh not, but believ|eth on him that ju&s;tifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteou&s;ne&s;s", Rom. 4.5. That we may have a clear under&s;tanding of the&s;e words, and their perfect con&s;i&s;tency with what has been &s;aid of faith as a work, let it be con&s;idered; the apo&s;tle, in the 2d ver. of this chapter, argues that Abraham was not ju&s;tified upon the foot of law, in con&s;ideration of works done in conformity to law, becau&s;e he would then have room for BOASTING; which he had not. His words are the&s;e, "If Abraham was ju&s;tified by works, he hath whereof to glory [boa&s;t]; but not before God". As if he had &s;aid, If Abraham had been ju&s;ti|fied upon a claim founded on works done in obedience to the law, he would have had matter of glorying, he might have boa&s;ted of his ju&s;tification, as what was his due; but before, or in the &s;ight of God, he had no &s;uch rea&s;on for boa&s;ting. And why? It follows, as an illu&s;tration of what he had thus argued, ver. 3, 4, 5. "What &s;aith the &s;cripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteou&s;ne&s;s. Now to him that worketh, is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt. But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that ju&s;tifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteou&s;ne&s;s". As if he had &s;aid, tis evident from the &s;cripture, that Abraham had no room for BOASTING in the affair of his ju&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fication, becau&s;e it a&s;&s;ures us, that "he believed God", and that God, of meer grace, "counted his faith to him for righteou&s;ne&s;s". Now there would have been no need of this "gracious counting", if, by his works, he had attained to righteo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ne&s;s in the e&s;teem of the law; for, when a per&s;on is righteous in the eye of the law, in con&s;ideration of the works of righteou&s;ne&s;s he hath done in conformity to it, "the reward is not counted a gift", but "adjudged to him as his due": Whereas, if he does not work at all, with a view to attain a righteou&s;ne&s;s, that will make him righteous, in the account of the law; but, in&s;tead of &s;uch working, believes in God, who, of his meer grace, ju&s;tifies tho&s;e, who, at the very time he ju&s;tifies them, are UNGODLY in the eye of the law, to him faith is "coun|ted for righteou&s;ne&s;s", &s;o as to remove away all ground of glorying or boa&s;ting. This, I am per&s;uaded, will be found, upon the &s;tricte&s;t examination, to be the real meaning of the apo&s;tle. The works, he here &s;peaks of, as giving occa&s;ion for boa&s;ting, and therefore ex|cludes from having any thing to do in the affair of ju&s;tification, are evidently &s;uch as are wro't to &s;upport a claim to the reward, in the eye of the law; they are &s;uch, as, when a man has performed them, places him beyond the need of grace, in order to his being "counted righteous"; they are &s;uch as he may pro|duce as his righteou&s;ne&s;s, and demand their being accep|ted, in this view, by the rule of law; they are &s;uch, in a word, as lay him under no bonds to "grace", in the affair or his ju&s;tification, but, in&s;tead of a&s;cribing it to "grace" that he is ju&s;tified, he may attribute it to "his own works", and "glory" in them, "boa&s;t" of them, as the ju&s;t ground and rea&s;on hereof. Need I now &s;ay, that faith, &s;hould it be con&s;idered as be&s;peak|ing the u&s;e of intellectual faculties, and the exerci&s;e or activity of the human mind, is yet far from being a work, in the &s;en&s;e that works are here excluded by the apo&s;tle? How &s;hould faith be a work to be glo|ried in, and boa&s;ted of, as tho', in its own virtue, it would give a title to ju&s;tification, when tis not po&s;&s;i|ble a man &s;hould have faith, and not &s;ee that he is ab&s;olutely undone without the interpo&s;ition of grace. The very &s;uppo&s;ition, that he may be ju&s;tified upon the foot of faith, eternally excludes all boa&s;ting; be|cau&s;e he could not be thus ju&s;tified, but of the free favor of God. He cannot indeed believe &s;o as to be ju&s;tified, without believing that he is UNGODLY, and a SINNER, in the eye of the law, and, as &s;uch, de|&s;erving of damnation, at the time when he is ju&s;tified. And will &s;uch a faith, whatever activity it may carry in it, afford the lea&s;t conceivable ground for boa&s;ting? Far from this, the more active and vigorous a man's faith is, the more effectually it will guard him again&s;t that glorying the apo&s;tle is &s;o jealous of.</P>
<P>Another text urged again&s;t faith's being con&s;idered as a work, is Rom. 11.6. "If by grace, then it is no more of works: Otherwi&s;e grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then it is no more grace: Other|wi&s;e work is no more work". But what has been above offered, is equally applicable here. I &s;hall therefore only add at pre&s;ent, that it concerns our author, and tho&s;e who think as he does, to reconcile the ju&s;t recited words of the apo&s;tle Paul, and tho&s;e al&s;o, Eph 2.8, 9. "By grace ye are &s;aved,&mdash;not of works, le&s;t any man &s;hould boa&s;t", with the doctrine they teach, pag. 356. that it &s;hall be rendered to be|lievers "according to their works"; yea, and that it is a "point of ju&s;tice", that it &s;hould be thus ren|dered to them. Perhaps, the reconciliation of their own doctrine, with the above texts, will enable others, in the &s;ame way, to reconcile their notion of faith, as a work, with the &s;ame in&s;pired words. I may venture to re&s;t the whole upon this i&s;&s;ue.</P></NOTE>

And according to this meaning of works, no man ever did, or ever will obtain "the ju&s;tification of life", in con&s;equence of his doing them.

<P N="2">II. TIS a ju&s;t remark, from what has been &s;aid of the "faith that ju&s;tifies", that the evidence in proof to a man, that he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it, can't be full and &s;trong, till his faith has "wro't by love, and di&s;covered it&s;elf to be of the right kind by its genuine fruits. His faith, previous to this, that is, before it had produced the meet effects, may be of the ju&s;tifying kind; and God may know it to be &s;o. For which rea&s;on, &s;hould he be called out of the world (as it is po&s;&s;ible he may) before he has had opportunity to "&s;hew his faith by his works", it would be no hindrance to his admi&s;&s;ion into the heavenly kingdom. For, be|ing po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of faith in its truth, God knows that he really is, in the fir&s;t rudiments, that penitent and convert, that new-man in Chri&s;t and par|taker of the divine holine&s;s, which the &s;cripture points out as the proper "meetne&s;s for the in|heritance of the &s;aints in light". We judge of the cau&s;e by the effects, of the &s;tate of men's minds, by the tenor of their actions: But God, who is "greater than our hearts, and knoweth all things", can judge of effects by their cau&s;e, and know what a man's temper and conduct will be, by the &s;prings and principles he is endowed with. Con&s;equently, as faith, when of the right &s;ort, is all and every thing, in the root or &s;eed, whoever is the &s;ubject of it, in the view of God, who&s;e judgment of it, while lying naked in the mind, is infallibly true, will be owned by him as one, marked out, in the go&s;pel-revelation, for the joys of his pre&s;ence. But this is not the way, in which we are to judge of the faith, we may

But this, as it re&s;pects the main thing in que&s;tion, is to di&s;tingui&s;h, and upon his own plan too, where there is really no material difference. For no man, according to him, can be a&s;&s;ured that his faith is ge|nuine, or, in words he will, perhaps, like better, that what he believes is the "&s;imple truth" that ju&s;tifies, but by its operation. And, if the fruit of faith mu&s;t be attended to, before a profe&s;&s;or of faith can know that his faith is of the right kind, it comes at la&s;t to the &s;ame thing, whether this a&s;&s;urance be called "the a&s;&s;urance of faith", or "the a&s;&s;urance of hope": To be &s;ure, he can't have "the a&s;&s;urance of hope", with|out having "the a&s;&s;urance of faith". He may be vainly confident, that he is in a &s;tate of acceptance with God, while yet he is not a&s;&s;ured, that the "&s;a|lutary truth" dwelleth in him. But he can't, upon &s;cripture-grounds, be a&s;&s;ured of his being in this ac|cepted &s;tate, any further than he is a&s;&s;ured, that he believes the truth; and of this latter he can be a&s;&s;ured in no way, but by the effects his faith produces. A man's hope therefore, mu&s;t keep pace exactly with his faith. If he han't "the a&s;&s;urance of faith", he can't have "the a&s;&s;urance of hope". His latter a&s;&s;urance mu&s;t always be proportioned to the former.&mdash;Our author &s;eems likewi&s;e to think, that "peace with God", and "rejoicing in Chri&s;t", as flowing, under the influence of the comforting &s;pirit, from &s;elf-deny'd obedience out of love to the truth, is one of the prin|cipal grounds of "the a&s;&s;urance of hope". The dif|ference here between him, and others, lies chiefly in a point of order; in which, as I apprehend, the mi&s;take is on his &s;ide. But be th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s as it may, the grand que&s;tion to be decided is, how &s;hall a man be a&s;&s;ured, that his joy is true, and not fal&s;e? Our author's way to an a&s;&s;urance of this is, when placed in a ju&s;t and clear light, much the &s;ame with their's, which he rejects: Nor is it either &s;horter, or le&s;s perplext. He mu&s;t have, according to his own way, if I may u&s;e the language he has done, without being tho't to &s;peak prophanely of a matter of &s;uch &s;erious importance, as "long-winded and dreary a &s;tory" to tell, as any of tho&s;e he oppo&s;es. For he can never know, according to his own principles, whether his joy is true or fal&s;e, genuine or counterfeit, but by examining, not only into his "&s;elf deny'd obedience", but "the love of the truth" it mu&s;t proceed from; and being thereupon a&s;&s;ured, that his obedience took ri&s;e from this &s;ource. Perhaps, upon tryal, this will be found as difficult and puzzling a bui&s;ine&s;s, as he has made it, upon the &s;cheme of the popular preachers. He &s;ays, pag. 395. "No profe&s;&s;or of the faith can form a proper judgment of his &s;tate, meerly by "poring on his own heart", and examining whether his religious tho'ts are of the right kind, or not; for, if he is not engaged in the practice of the peculiar precepts of chri&s;tianity, or in doing tho&s;e works which are the proper fruits of faith, he has no occa&s;ion for &s;elf-examination; as there is, in that ca&s;e, no room for any doubt concerning his &s;tate". I freely concur with him in what he here &s;ays; but then I would ob&s;erve, on the other hand, neither can he, upon his own &s;cheme, form a proper judgment of his &s;tate, mo&s;t certainly not an a&s;&s;ured one, meerly by examining whether he is "engaged in the practice of the peculiar precepts of chri&s;tianity"; for, as he &s;ays, pag. ibid. "men may be engaged in the practice of the &s;ame works. from VERY DIFFERENT MOTIVES, of which every man's own con&s;cience is be&s;t judge". And let it be remembered, the MOTIVE to practice, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, mu&s;t be found to be "the love of the &s;alutary truth". Belief of this truth mu&s;t in&s;pire love to it, and this love mu&s;t produce this obedience. This is a leading &s;entiment in this writer's plan. And are we not now unavoidably led to that "poring on the heart", which he &s;peaks of in &s;o &s;neering a way? "Love" is, mo&s;t certainly, an affection of the &s;oul. Con&s;equently, if we mu&s;t know that our religious practice flows from "love", and love to "the &s;imple truth", we mu&s;t look within, and very narrowly too, or we may place vain confidence, as thou&s;ands have done, in the room of go&s;pel-a&s;&s;urance. Tis a plain ca&s;e, our author, if he would, in his own way, attain to an a&s;&s;urance of his being in a good &s;tate towards God, mu&s;t repair to that &s;ame &s;ort of exerci&s;e he light|ly calls "heart-work", and be thorow in it too; o|therwi&s;e he may, as "the heart is deceitful", delude him&s;elf into ruin.&mdash;I &s;hall add here, faith, in his account, is a meer pretence, a vain profe&s;&s;ion, unle&s;s it is "a principle of life and action", producing, a|mong other things, "that change upon a man, which is called <HI>repentance unto life</HI>", pag. 408; "that change likewi&s;e which gets the name of <HI>&s;elf-denyal</HI>", pag. 409; "that change al&s;o which is called <HI>conver&s;ion, regene|ration, new-creation,</HI> or <HI>the new creature; putting off the old man with his deeds,</HI> and <HI>putting on the new-man; walking not after the fle&s;h, but after the &s;pirit</HI>", pag. 412. Now, if faith is &s;uch a principle as this, no man's joy, under the profe&s;&s;ion of faith, can be any other than "the joy of the hypocrite", unle&s;s it is productive of the&s;e fruits; and con&s;equently no man can be a&s;&s;ured, that his faith is genuine, till he finds, upon tryal, that it has actually bro't them forth. Upon which, I can't help admiring, that he &s;hould &s;peak, as he &s;ometimes does, with &s;uch an air of merriment, upon that change in men, which is &s;igni|fied by repentance, conver&s;ion, and the like. If &s;ome, thro' mi&s;take, have tho't, that this change is previous to faith, in the order of nature, tho' not of time; will &s;uch a &s;peculative error &s;ubvert the reality of the thing it&s;elf? May not a man be the &s;ubject of this change, tho' he &s;hould not think ju&s;t as our author does about the order, or way, in which he became po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it? Is it the manner of real chri&s;tians to make a &s;arce of &s;o &s;erious and intere&s;ting a matter, turning it into ridi|cule and banter? Does the language he has u&s;ed look like their's, who&s;e love of the truth has transformed them into new men in Chri&s;t? He would have acted more in character as a profe&s;&s;ed di&s;ciple of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and &s;erved his cau&s;e too much better, if he had &s;poke upon this head in words of &s;ober gravity. His man|ner of writing, it may be feared, has been the occa&s;ion of leading &s;ome "unwary &s;ouls" into contemptuous tho'ts of the <HI>moral-change,</HI> meant in &s;cripture, by CON|VERSION; which yet, is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary a one, that no man can enter into the holy heaven without it: Yea, &s;hould a man make the highe&s;t pretences to the a&s;&s;u|rance, both of faith and hope, he would, notwith|&s;tanding, if his faith did not operate to effect this CHANGE, be certainly bid, at the appearing of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to depart away from him, among the workers of iniquity, whom he knew not.</NOTE> upon ju&s;t grounds, that tis of the

But this does not argue, that we ought not to look to the workings of our hearts, and the actions of our lives, as produced by faith, in order to our enjoying that "peace of

And, con&s;equently, tis by the&s;e effects, that we attain to a &s;tate of &s;piritual peace and comfort. "Perceiving about us the&s;e fruits of faith", we ju&s;tly &amp; &s;trongly conclude from hence, that our faith is of the right kind; and, if of the right kind, connected, by the go&s;pel-plan, with "the ju&s;tification of life": And if we are "ju&s;ti|fied by faith", we may, upon the mo&s;t &s;olid foun|dation, enjoy "peace with God thro' our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t". It is Chri&s;t, or, what means the &s;ame thing, the work of Chri&s;t as the redeemer of &s;inners, that is ultimately the ground or rea|&s;on of this "peace"; but &s;till, the "working of faith", the fruits it produces, are the "medium" by which we come to the enjoyment of it: Nor can any man give a good &s;cripture-rea&s;on for his rejoicing in hope", but from his being able to "prove his faith by his works". For this is the only &s;trong and full evidence, that can be given in proof of its being of the right kind.

Thus &s;peaks our author with exact truth and ju&s;tice. I would add &s;till fur|ther, whatever illuminations and experiences, inter|nal feelings and religious motions, any may pretend to, wherein they are excited by, or take ri&s;e from, the "artful addre&s;s" of &s;ome admired &s;peaker, in&s;tead of the pure word of truth, they are not worthy of being &s;o much as mentioned in proof of the real being of faith: They ought rather to be looked upon as the operation of animal-nature. This is certainly the ca&s;e, when go&s;pel-truths have no power to excite the&s;e &s;en&s;ations, but as borrowed from the voice and action of &s;ome popular preacher. If per&s;ons have no reli&s;h for revealed truths, no di&s;po&s;ition to hearken to them; or if the&s;e truths are in&s;ufficient to move their hearts, touch their con&s;ciences, &s;et in motion their affections, and produce any good impre&s;&s;ions on them, unle&s;s they are enlivened by "the wi&s;dom of words", that is, the eloquence of man, it may be taken for granted, with|out further con&s;ideration, that &s;uch experience "&s;tands in the wi&s;dom of man", not "in the power of God". The word of the eternal God, &s;imply and nakedly propo&s;ed, is "able", under the influence of the divine &s;pirit, "to make men wi&s;e to &s;alvation". It needs no human art to give it force and energy. And if what men experience is the effect, not of the "word it&s;elf", but the "manner" in which it is di&s;|pen&s;ed, tis wholly a mechanical motion, and of no more profit, in the &s;piritual &s;en&s;e, than that which is cau&s;ed by the "&s;ounding of bra&s;s", or "the tinkling of a cymbal". It may be worthy of &s;pecial remark, the apo&s;tles "&s;ought not glory of men". They de|&s;pi&s;ed the tho't of gaining applau&s;e by artful ad|dre&s;&s;es, purpo&s;ely contrived to move their pa&s;&s;ions. Their manner was, by a &s;imple, plain "manife&s;ta|tion of the truth, to commend them&s;elves to every man's con&s;cience in the &s;ight of God". They knew, tho' their hearers gloried in them, they would reap no &s;aving good by their mini&s;trations, unle&s;s they "heard God &s;peaking" in the me&s;&s;ages they bro't to them. Their dependance therefore for &s;ucce&s;s was grounded on the "power of God's word, meerly as &s;uch", and not on the force or virtue they could give it by any art, or craft, they could u&s;e in the delivery of it. The latter might have &s;ecured votaries to them, and the profitable, as well as plea&s;ing advantages, con|nected with popular admiration and acceptance; but it would have been of no &s;piritual profit to their hearers: It might have tickled their fancies, but would not have &s;aved their &s;ouls. The apo&s;tle Paul, tho' learned in all the wi&s;dom of that day, that is, in all the arts that were fitted to gain admirers, by work|ing upon animal nature, e&s;teemed it a reproach to the infinitely intere&s;ting truths of the go&s;pel, to deliver them in a theatrical worldly-wi&s;e mann<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> tho' they needed human art and help to gain admitance into the minds of men.

Let us be more and more contented with the condition it &s;hall plea&s;e God to a lot to us, in the pre&s;ent world; finding no fault with him, tho' he &s;hould call us to conflict with tryals, grievous to bear; as knowing, that if we meet with evil things here, we &s;hall be comforted here|after. In a word, let us live above the world, having our heart in heaven, and "our conver&s;a|tion in heaven, from whence we look for the Savior, the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t", who, "when he appears a &s;econd time without &s;in unto &s;alvation", will "change our vile bodies, that they may be fa&s;hioned like to his glorious body": And we &s;hall then be ever happy with him, in the king|dom of his father.</P>
<P>IN fine, &s;ome of us, it may be, tho' we have tried our faith, and have &s;o done again and again, are yet full of fears and doubts, as not knowing, after all, whether it is of the right &s;ort. If we can't peremptorily determine, on the one hand, that we have no other faith than that which is common to tho&s;e profe&s;&s;ors of chri&s;tianity, to
<PB N="142" REF="009925_0147_0F7B390B0C451148">
whom our Lord will finally &s;ay, "I know you not, depart from me ye workers of iniquity"; &s;o neither, on the other hand, can we, with de|&s;ireable &s;atisfaction, &s;ay, that "we have believed in him that rai&s;ed Je&s;us from the dead", with a faith that has been "imputed to us for righte|ou&s;ne&s;s". And we accordingly live &s;ometimes hoping, &s;ometimes fearing; always doubting, but never rejoicing in an a&s;&s;ured hope of our being intere&s;ted, thro' faith, in the purcha&s;es of the re|deemer's cro&s;s. And this, perhaps, is the truth of fact, with re&s;pect to the generality of believers in Chri&s;t, tho&s;e of them, I mean, who&s;e faith is connected with that "eternal life", which is "the gift of God thro' our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t". It may &s;eem &s;trange it &s;hould be thus, when &s;o many, in the days of the apo&s;tles, were, in con|&s;equence of their faith, the happy &s;ubjects of "peace with God", and "rejoicing in Chri&s;t Je&s;us"; e&s;pecially, as the way to the&s;e "com|forts of the holy Gho&s;t" is the &s;ame now, that it was then; and chri&s;tians, in the&s;e days, are fa|vor'd with the &s;ame revealed means, and advan|tages, chri&s;tians were then, in order to their at|taining to the "joy of faith". But the principal rea&s;on of this is to be fetched, from the &s;lothful inactivity of the pre&s;ent chri&s;tians. They don't take due care to &s;hew to them&s;elves, any more than to others, that they have faith, by the exer|ci&s;e of tho&s;e graces, which, "by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, are to the prai&s;e and glory of God". If they are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the&s;e graces, they have made no great improvements in them. They have not "grown in grace, and in the knowledge of Chri&s;t", as might be expected and wi&s;hed. "The work of God may be begun in them"; but it has not
<PB N="143" REF="009925_0148_0F7B390D71B013D8">
been carried on, in any con&s;iderable degree. They have not attained to the "&s;tature of men in Chri&s;t"; but may rather be e&s;teemed "babes": And their exertments, in the chri&s;tian life, are ac|cordingly feeble and lanquid, and too often inter|rupted by the influence of temptation and cor|ruption. And what wonder is it, if they live in uncertainty about their &s;piritual &s;tate; and, in|&s;tead of enjoying true &s;erenity of &s;oul, are per|plext with fears and doubts.</P>
<P>WOULD we attain to "the full a&s;&s;urance of hope", and to "joy in God thro' our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t", in con&s;equence hereof, we mu&s;t, as the apo&s;tle Peter directs, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Pet. 1.5, 6, 7.</NOTE> "give all diligence to add to our faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, pa|tience, godline&s;s, brotherly-kindne&s;s, &amp; charity"; and not only &s;o, but "to abound in the&s;e things". The apo&s;tle's view is, to engage our zeal and care in attaining to the greate&s;t eminency in the&s;e graces, which at once "adorn" both the chri&s;ti|an's character, and "the doctrine of our Savior Je&s;us Chri&s;t". Nor can we take a more &s;criptu|ral, or effectual, method to "make our calling and election &s;ure". For it is by the graces o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> God's &s;pirit, thrown into exerci&s;e upon all proper occa&s;ions, that our faith is &s;hewn, not to be "dead", but to exi&s;t in us as a real principle of life. And the higher we ri&s;e in the actings of our love to God, tru&s;t in Chri&s;t, hatred of &s;in, weanedne&s;s from the world, and the like, the &s;tronger &amp; brighter will be the di&s;covery, our faith makes of its reality and power in us. It now &s;hews it&s;elf by its proper fruits; and by the&s;e, under the influence of the divine &s;pirit, we may
<PB N="144" REF="009925_0149_0F7B390E2A18EAA0">
certainly know, that it is the "faith, by which the ju&s;t do live": <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd in con&s;equence of this knowledge, we may, upon the mo&s;t &s;olid grounds, "joy in God thro' our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, by whom we have received the atonement".</P>
<P>THE be&s;t remedy, after all that can be &s;aid, again&s;t &s;piritual darkne&s;s and di&s;tre&s;s, and the be&s;t way to get &s;piritual peace and joy, is to rou&s;e our&s;elves up to tho&s;e "labors of love", which are the "work of faith"; to quicken our pace in the paths of righteou&s;ne&s;s; to be more earne&s;t in our cares, re&s;pecting our &s;ouls, and another world; to &s;trive more re&s;olutely again&s;t &s;in; to be more watchful again&s;t temptation; to love God more intirely; to pray to him more fervently; and to be more con&s;tant and devout in the &s;ervices of piety, and more circum&s;pect in ordering our conver&s;ation among men, that, "as we have received how we ought to walk and plea&s;e God, we may abound daily more and more".</P>
<P>OUR faith &s;hould be productive of good di&s;po&s;itions, and the&s;e &s;hould be continually &s;trengthened, till they become well e&s;tabli&s;hed principles of action. And &s;o &s;hall we find, from our own experience, that the wi&s;e man &s;pake the truth, when he &s;aid, "the path of the ju&s;t is as the &s;hining light, which &s;hineth more and more to the perfect day. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. 4.18.</NOTE> As we thus, by the operation of faith, under the ble&s;&s;ing of heaven, improve in holine&s;s, we &s;hall find our doubts and fears will di&s;per&s;e and vani&s;h, and our hope grow into a&s;&s;urance. We &s;hall know, by the
<PB N="145" REF="009925_0150_0F7B390EC594F098">
abounding fruits of our faith, that our &s;tate is &s;afe, as "there is no condemnation to us, being in Chri&s;t Je&s;us". And "the peace of God will now rule in our hearts". We &s;hall feel &s;erenity in our tho'ts, tranquility in our con&s;ciences, and joy in our brea&s;ts that is "un&s;peakable and full of glory". We may now &s;olace our&s;elves under the heavie&s;t weight of outward affliction; yea, we may "rejoice in tribulation", as we are cha&s;tened becau&s;e we are children, and under di&s;cipline for our &s;priritual and eternal profit,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To tho&s;e, who are "lovers of plea&s;ures more than lovers of God", it may be a paradox to &s;ay, that be|lievers may rejoice when called, in providence, to en|dure afflictive tryals; looking upon them as proofs of the love and kindne&s;s of their heavenly father, and his u&s;ing a wi&s;e and proper means with them to pro|mote their advantage. But this is a truth plainly and particularly revealed in the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t. Says the apo&s;tle James, chap. 5. ver. 11. "Behold, we count them happy which endure". And again, chap. 1. ver. 2. "Brethren, count it all joy, when ye fall into diver&s;e temptations". And why? The rea&s;on follows in the next words, "knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience"; and, as a|nother apo&s;tle expre&s;&s;es it, Rom. 5.4, 5. "patience, experience; and experience, hope: And hope maketh not a&s;hamed, becau&s;e the love of God is &s;hed abroad in your hearts by the holy Gho&s;t".&mdash;There is no &s;chool, like that of affliction, to train up chri&s;tians to a "meetne&s;s" for heavenly glory, in its highe&s;t degrees. And, among tho&s;e who "name the name of Chri&s;t", there are ordinarily none &s;o eminent for their meekne&s;s; patience; humility; contempt of the world; the lively actings of faith, hope, tru&s;t in God, and a profound &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of &s;oul to his alwi&s;e, righteous, holy and &s;overeign plea&s;ure, as tho&s;e who have pa&s;&s;ed thro' the heavie&s;t tryals. Twas with a &s;pecial view to their making eminent proficiency in the&s;e, and the like chri&s;tian graces, and to give oppor|tunity, and occa&s;ion, for throwing them out into ex|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mplary acts, that God, in order to their "greater reward in heaven", put them upon enduring the&s;e things, which, "for the pre&s;ent, were not joyous, but grievous". Tho&s;e good chri&s;tians, who &s;uffer mo&s;t here, are commonly tho&s;e, who &s;hall be mo&s;t happy hereafter. Not but that believers may "adorn" their profe&s;&s;ion, and "the doctrine of their Savior", in a pro&s;perous &s;tate. Hence that remark in the book of the Acts, chap. 9. ver. 31. "Then had the churches <HI>re&s;t,&mdash; and were edified, walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the holy Gho&s;t</HI>". Nei|ther the "truth of faith", nor "the comfort of it", are confined to a &s;uffering condition in this world: Tho' "&s;uffering with Chri&s;t" is the more common way to glory; and tho&s;e, who have been mo&s;t tried with &s;ufferings, are ordinarily tho&s;e who are be&s;t prepared for the brighte&s;t crown, in the heavenly and eternal world. Our author be&s;t knows, how far what is here &s;aid, will con&s;i&s;t with his notion of "the &s;ufferings, good chri&s;tians are called to pa&s;s thro'." I have given above, as I imagine, a true and ju&s;t repre&s;entation of the go&s;pel-account of them.</NOTE>

and may "know that all things &s;hall work to|gether for our good", as they do for their's who "love God, and are the called according to his purpo&s;e". In fine, we may now have confidence towards God in the hour of deaths, and triumph in the pro&s;pect of tho&s;e immortal joys, which the father of mercies has provided, and laid up in heaven, for all true believers in his &s;on.</P>
<P>GOD grant we may all &s;o "believe in him whom God hath &s;ent", as to enjoy inward ea&s;e &amp; peace while we live, and to be in the exerci&s;e of an a&s;&s;ured hope, when we are called to depart hence, of going to be eternally happy in the kingdom of God, and of Je&s;us Chri&s;t! AMEN.</P>

<HEAD>SERMON VI. The Place and U&s;e of Faith, in the Affair of Ju&s;tification.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>GALATIANS II. 16.</BIBL>
<P>"Knowing that a man is not ju&s;tified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, even we have believed in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that we might be ju&s;ti|fied by the faith of Chri&s;t"&mdash;.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>I HAVE already, in &s;everal di&s;cour&s;es from this text, endeavoured to let you into the true meaning of the faith that is connected with ju&s;tification. What I now principally de|&s;ign is, to point out to you the "rea&s;on" of this connection, or to lead you into the &s;cripture-notion of the proper "place", and "u&s;e", of faith in this bui&s;ine&s;s of infinite importance to us all.</P>
<P>IN order whereto, it will be needful to ob&s;erve, that &s;everal things are particularly mentioned, in the &s;acred books, as bearing their part in the
<PB N="148" REF="009925_0153_0F7B391372636DE8">
affair of the &s;inner's ju&s;tification; each of which have their "di&s;tinct u&s;e", and are, in their "pro|per place", ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in order to our partaking of this ble&s;&s;ed privilege. The fir&s;t, relates to "God"; the &s;econd, to "Chri&s;t"; and the third, to "our&s;elves".</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t thing to be con&s;idered in the affair of ju&s;tification, and that indeed which gave ri&s;e to it, is the "grace of God", his free favor, good will and kindne&s;s towards men. The infinitely benevolent being was not excited, either to pur|po&s;e, or contrive, or reveal, or execute the go&s;pel-plan of &s;alvation, by any motive extraneous to him&s;elf. Meer goodne&s;s was the &s;ource, and the only one, from whence it originated. Even the blood of Chri&s;t was of no con&s;ideration, in a way of motive or argument, to per&s;uade the ble&s;&s;ed God hereto. For the intervening mediation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and all that he did and &s;uffered on earth, or is now doing in heaven, are to be looked upon as <HI>means</HI> only in the execution of the pur|po&s;ed &s;cheme of redemption; not the incentive that prompted the all-merciful God to come into it. This is the point of view in which the &s;crip|ture repre&s;ents the matter. The gift of Chri&s;t to become incarnate, and humble him&s;elf to death, even the death of the cro&s;s, is &s;poken of as the great a&s;toni&s;hing in&s;tance of the moving of God's heart in compa&s;&s;ion towards &s;inners. To this it was owing, that he &s;ent his &s;on Je&s;us into our world, to &s;u&s;tain and execute the office of its Savior. The new-te&s;tament is particularly ex|pre&s;s upon this point. "In this was manife&s;ted the love of God towards us, becau&s;e that God &s;ent his only begotten &s;on into the world, that
<PB N="149" REF="009925_0154_0F7B39143398F430">
we might live thro' him". <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 John 4.9.</NOTE> And again, "God &s;o loved the world, that he gave his only begotten &s;on, that who&s;oever believeth on him, &s;hould not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting life". <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">John 3.16.</NOTE> The lan|guage, in the&s;e texts, is emphatically &s;trong, and does, in the fulle&s;t manner, expre&s;s the original e&s;&s;ential benevolence of God; a&s;cribing it to this, as the true and only &s;pring, that Chri&s;t was &s;ent into the world, "not to condemn the world, but that the world thro' him might be &s;aved". Had he not been moved by the infinite goodne&s;s of his own nature, he would neither have purpo&s;ed, or contrived this wonderful expedient for our ever|la&s;ting benefit: It proceded from love, antece|dently to all con&s;iderations whatever. And to the &s;ame love it was owing, that this &s;cheme, when purpo&s;ed and contrived, was revealed to Adam, to Abraham, to Mo&s;es, to the Prophets, and more fully, in the times of the go&s;pel, to the Apo&s;tles, and thro' them to the whole world. The in&s;pired Paul therefore &s;ays, "we are ju&s;ti|fied freely of God's grace". <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. 3.24.</NOTE> And, &s;peaking of ju&s;tification, he calls it a "free gift"; "the gift by grace"; "the gift" emphatically; and again, "the free gift". <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Rom. 5.15, 16.</NOTE> And he might, with all pro|priety, &s;peak of it in this language; for it is, in regard of its original &s;ource, an ab&s;olutely free favor. We were indeed, in the eye of God, "without &s;trength", "enemies", "ungodly", "&s;inners", when he purpo&s;ed and contrived the go&s;pel-method of ju&s;tification. Grace therefore, and that only, could be the excitement to it.</P>
<P>I NEED not now &s;ay, that faith, in this view of ju&s;tification, is of no u&s;e, of no influence, in any
<PB N="150" REF="009925_0155_0F7B3914C1DC49B0">
&s;en&s;e whatever. The part it has to act is &s;ub|&s;equent to, and wholly dependant on, the grace of God, that grace of his, which, previous to all con&s;ideration of faith, works, or worthine&s;s, in any kind or &s;hape, made this ble&s;&s;ed privilege an obtainable one; and this, for all &s;orts of &s;inners: for the openly prophane, the hypocritically de|vout, the &s;tupidly tho'tle&s;s, the hardened in infi|delity and an univer&s;al debauchery of manners, as well as others le&s;s odious and guilty. It was indeed, while viewing &s;inners in all their various degrees of &s;infulne&s;s and unworthine&s;s, that the infinitely good God found within him&s;elf an heart, di&s;po&s;ing him to purpo&s;e and reveal the merciful plan, in con&s;equence of which they might obtain the ju&s;tification of life.</P>
<P>THE next thing, in the affair of ju&s;tification, relates to "Chri&s;t". For the &s;cripture not only declares, that we are "ju&s;tified <HI>freely</HI> by God's grace", but "thro' the redemption that is in Je&s;us Chri&s;t".<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. 3.24.</NOTE> We are accordingly &s;aid to "have redemption thro' his blood, the forgivene&s;s of &s;ins"; <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eph. 1.7.</NOTE> and to be "ju&s;tified by his blood". <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. 5.9.</NOTE> And "his blood", which "declares God to be ju&s;t in being the ju&s;tifier of the &s;inner", is empha|tically mentioned as one of the great truths, which are the object of that faith that is accompanied with a ju&s;tified &s;tate. <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Rom. 3.25, 26.</NOTE> In agreement with the&s;e apo&s;tolic repre&s;entations, "the gift by grace" is &s;aid to be "by the one man, Je&s;us Chri&s;t".<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Rom. 5.15.</NOTE> And "by the righteou&s;ne&s;s of this one man, the free gift is come upon all men to the ju&s;tification of life".<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 18.</NOTE> &mdash;But I have no need to multiply texts.
<PB N="151" REF="009925_0156_0F7B3915D9F36308">
Tis abundantly evident, from the general run of the new-te&s;tament-writings, that our ble&s;&s;ed Savior Je&s;us Chri&s;t, while in our world, "in fa&s;hion as a man", and "form of a &s;ervant", both did and &s;uffered every thing that was nece&s;&s;ary in order to a WORTHINESS, a RIGHTEOUSNESS, on account of which God might, in con&s;i&s;tency with the honor of his perfections, and the authority of his law and government, manife&s;t his mercy to|wards &s;inners, even the chief of them, in &s;aving them from wrath, and admiting them to the joys of his pre&s;ence in the kingdom of heaven. Ac|cordingly, this righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, in the re|flection on which he could appeal to his heavenly father, &s;aying, "I have glorified thee on earth, I have fini&s;hed the work which thou gave&s;t me to do"; and thereupon pray, "now, O father, glorifie thou me with thine own &s;elf, with the glory which I had with thee before the world was": <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John 17.4, 5.</NOTE> I &s;ay, this fini&s;hed work of Chri&s;t is that, with a view to which, for the &s;ake of which, in con&s;ide|ration of which, the &s;inner is ju&s;tified and &s;aved. This is the expedient, this the moral mean, the wi&s;dom of God, excited by his infinite benevo|lence, has contrived for the righteous and holy di&s;play of his grace towards the &s;inful &s;ons of men, in di&s;charging them from the demands of his law and ju&s;tice. And whoever are made partakers of this grace, the obedience of Chri&s;t, and eminent|ly that fini&s;hing act of it, his willingly &s;ubmiting to die on the cro&s;s, is the only meritorious ground of its be&s;towment. Tis not for the &s;ake "of any thing the &s;inner has about him" that he is acquit|ed from guilt, and accepted into favor. This is done by grace, thro' the atoning blood of Je&s;us
<PB N="152" REF="009925_0157_0F7B391640623C70">
Chri&s;t. The true rea&s;on of it is to be fetched from that a&s;toni&s;hing love, which gave the only begotten &s;on of God, that &s;inful men might be &s;aved from peri&s;hing, and this in a way that would be honorary to that glorious being, who is as ju&s;t and holy, as he is good and merciful.</P>
<P>TIS now ea&s;y to &s;ee, that ju&s;tification, as it re|&s;pects Chri&s;t, who&s;e character was perfect, and the only one that was &s;o, and, as &s;uch, well plea&s;ing to God, excludes even faith, as well as works, from being, in whole, or in part, the CONSIDERA|TION upon which the &s;inner is freed from the cur&s;e of the law, and in&s;tated in a right to eternal life. Chri&s;t's work was fini&s;hed on the cro&s;s, and needed neither faith, or any thing el&s;e that could be found in, or done by, us, to render it more compleat, as a rea&s;on for ju&s;tifying the &s;inner, than it would be without them. Faith therefore, tho' nece&s;&s;ary in order to ju&s;tification, and tho' it operates to the obtainment of this privilege, is yet wholly u&s;ele&s;s, as the ground or rea&s;on of its be&s;towment. This is a ble&s;&s;ing, the grant of which was made &s;olely with a view to Chri&s;t, and upon the account of his obedience, the la&s;t and greate&s;t act of which was, his making his "&s;oul an offering for &s;in".</P>
<P>THE la&s;t thing relating to ju&s;tification is "faith", the &s;cripture-connection of which, with this go&s;pel privilege I am now naturally bro't to make ea&s;y and familiar to you.</P>
<P>AND, in general, its office, from what has been already &s;aid, mu&s;t be con&s;idered as not only &s;ub|&s;ervient to grace and Chri&s;t, but as grounded on

them, &s;ubordinated to them, and receiving its virtue from them, in its whole operation. It has a quite different u&s;e from that, which the in&s;pired writers a&s;&s;ign to the grace of God, and the atone|ment by Chri&s;t. For which rea&s;on, we &s;hall en|tertain wrong &s;entiments of its u&s;e, if we &s;ub&s;ti|tute it in the room of that which is alotted to either of the former; or &s;o mix its u&s;e with their's, as to a&s;cribe to it the part which belongs to them, and not it&s;elf. The &s;pecial operation of the&s;e &s;everal requi&s;ites are pre&s;erved di&s;tinct from each other, in the new-te&s;tament-books; which ever repre&s;ent them as jointly concuring in the affair of ju&s;tification, but yet in different and duly &s;ubordinated re&s;pects. The&s;e requi&s;ites mu&s;t not therefore be mi&s;placed in our tho'ts, or the u&s;e of any one of them &s;o confounded with the u&s;e of the other, as to break that harmonious wi&s;ely &s;ubordinated order, in which the &s;acred pen-men &s;peak of them as unitedly operating, tho' in different views, to the production of the &s;ame good effect. To be &s;ure, if we give faith the part of grace, or Chri&s;t; or &s;o mingle it's u&s;e with their's, as to de&s;troy its &s;ub&s;erviency to them, we &s;hall gro&s;ly mi&s;apprehend the matter, and in|cur the danger of transfering that glory to our|&s;elves, in the bui&s;ine&s;s of ju&s;tification, which is due only to God, and our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Faith, as well as works, may be oppo&s;ed to Chri&s;t in the affair of a &s;inner's being ju&s;tified; and &s;hould we view it as the con&s;ideration, in the virtue of which we are in&s;tated in this privilege, we &s;hould be ju&s;tly chargeable with that "e&s;tabli&s;hing our own righteou&s;ne&s;s", in oppo&s;ition to "the righ|teou&s;ne&s;s of God", which is &s;o frequently and pre&s;&s;ingly cautioned again&s;t by the apo&s;tle Paul.

For "if life could come by faith", in its own virtue, that is, as the con&s;ideration entitling here|to, then is the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t rendered needle&s;s, as truly as in the ca&s;e of works, and he "died in vain".&mdash;But to come more directly to the point.</P>
<P>FAITH is connected with, and operates towards, the ju&s;tification of life, as it is that character, mark, or qualification in us, without which we cannot, conformably to the go&s;pel-plan, be in|&s;tated in the enjoyment of this benefit. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">What is here offered directly oppo&s;es the doctrine taught by our author. He tells us, pag. 96, "that if we ima|gine we po&s;&s;e&s;s, or de&s;ire to attain to any REQUISITE to our acceptance with God, either a&s;ide from, or in connection with, THE BARE WORK OF CHRIST,&mdash; Chri&s;t is become of no effect to us,&mdash;Chri&s;t will pro|fit us nothing". This work of Chri&s;t, he accordingly calls "THE SOLE REQUISITE"; and gives it this name "with the more plea&s;ure, as it readily puts him in mind of that &s;ignificant &s;aying of Je&s;us, <HI>one thing is needful</HI>". This &s;ame tho't, in words of like import, he frequently, if not needle&s;ly, repeats in all his letters. Upon which I would ob&s;erve, by a REQUISITE, in order to ju&s;tification, may be meant the meritorious ground of its be&s;towment, the con&s;ideration upon which, for the &s;ake of which, the &s;inner becomes in|tere&s;ted in it. In this &s;en&s;e of the term, our author will not &s;ay, cannot with truth, or ju&s;tice, &s;ay, that tho&s;e, he writes again&s;t, deny "<HI>the work of Chri&s;t</HI>" to be the SOLE REQUISITE, THE ONE THING NEED|FUL, in order to acceptance with God. They have ever taught this doctrine, and are indeed earne&s;t ad|vocates for it, as one of the e&s;&s;ential articles of the chri&s;tian faith. By a REQUISITE, may be meant al&s;o &s;omething previous to the &s;inner's actual intere&s;t in that "ju&s;tification of life", which is the &s;ole procure|ment of Chri&s;t; &s;omething nece&s;&s;ary to its be&s;tow|ment on this man, in di&s;tinction from another; &s;ome|thing, without which it can no more be thus be&s;towed, than if it had not been purcha&s;ed. And this is the &s;en&s;e, in which our author mu&s;t under&s;tand the term REQUISITE, if there is any meaning in the charges he would fa&s;ten upon the popular preachers. Upon any other &s;uppo&s;ition, his invectives again&s;t them are nothing more than railings again&s;t a phantom of his own imagination. Now, under&s;tanding the term REQUISITE in this only &s;en&s;e, in which it was ever u&s;ed by tho&s;e our author complains of, he has him&s;elf very often, however incon&s;i&s;tently, joined with them in &s;peaking the real truth upon this head. Tho' he has peremptorily made "the bare work of Chri&s;t" the SOLE REQUISITE to ju&s;tification; yet, he has as pe|remptorily bro't in ANOTHER REQUISITE, that is, &s;omething, without which no man, notwith&s;tanding "the work of Chri&s;t", &s;hall ever be accepted of God. And he has often done this, and with as much freedom as tho&s;e he would repre&s;ent as enemies to "the fini&s;ht work of Chri&s;t". He has affirmed over and over a|gain, in one place and another throughout his letters, that "the &s;imple truth" (by which he means the &s;ame thing with "the bare work of Chri&s;t") mu&s;t be <HI>believed, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, become a truth to a man</HI>; mu&s;t be <HI>a truth that he knows,</HI> mu&s;t <HI>be found by him to be the truth:</HI> Otherwi&s;e, it will be <HI>no benefit to him, he can reap no comfort, no advantage from it.</HI> If now tis nece&s;&s;ary, we &s;hould believe the truth, admit it into our minds as the truth, before we can be ju&s;tified, this admi&s;&s;ion of the truth into the mind, is as real a REQUISITE, in the &s;en&s;e above explained, in order to ju&s;tification, as the truth it&s;elf: Nor can the &s;inner be ju&s;tified with|out the one, any more than without the other. And this indeed is the &s;cripture-account of the matter. Tis as true as the expre&s;s declaration of the &s;on of God can make it, "that he that believeth not", that ad|miteth not into his mind the go&s;pel as the truth of God, "&s;hall be damned": Nor will "the fini&s;ht work of Chri&s;t" prevent it. To common under&s;tand|ings, that, I am ready to think, will appear a <HI>requi&s;ite,</HI> without the actual being and exi&s;tence of which, dam|nation will be the re&s;ult. If every one will certainly peri&s;h, who don't believe the truth, in who&s;e mind it don't exi&s;t as the truth, tis impo&s;&s;ible "the truth &s;imply in it&s;elf", meerly as &s;uch, &s;hould be the SOLE REQUISITE in order to life. Our author, if he plea&s;es, may call it &s;o; but it will be a <HI>&s;ole requi&s;ite</HI> of &s;uch a peculiar &s;ort, as that, unle&s;s <HI>another</HI> is connected with it, we &s;hall &s;urely be made mi&s;erable in the hell that is provided for unbelievers.</NOTE> It is

For it is writ|ten, "he that believeth not, is condemned alrea|dy".<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John 3.18.</NOTE> And again, "he that believeth not the &s;on, &s;hall not &s;ee life, but the wrath of God abideth on him".<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 36.</NOTE> On the other hand, tis as clearly and peremptorily written, "who&s;oever believeth in the only begotten &s;on of God, &s;hall not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting life"; <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 16.</NOTE> yea, it is written again, "he that believeth the &s;on hath everla&s;ting life",<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 36.</NOTE> hath it in actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in the beginings of it. The &s;inners therefore that are in a ju&s;tified &s;tate are tho&s;e only, who are di&s;tingui&s;hed from others by being believers in Chri&s;t.

They are, notwith&s;tanding this character, as view|ed by the law, without relation to grace and Chri&s;t, in the &s;ame guilty undone condition with other &s;inners, having no claim to mercy any more than they: But, taking into our view the con|nection God has been plea&s;ed, upon the plan of manife&s;ting his grace thro' the redemption there is in Chri&s;t, to con&s;titute between this character, and a ju&s;tified &s;tate, it becomes a mo&s;t intere&s;ting one, and makes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he difference between the&s;e and other &s;inners as great, as the difference between a &s;tate of freedom from wrath, and one of conti|nual expo&s;edne&s;s to it.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="009925_0163_0F7B391D82A742A0">THE plain truth is, the ju&s;tification of life, tho' the gift of God's grace, and his gift thro' the obe|dience of Chri&s;t to death, is no where, in the &s;a|cred writings, &s;aid to be be&s;towed upon &s;inners in common: Neither are the &s;inners, upon whom it is be&s;towed, pointed out by their names; but by this grand characteri&s;tic, "faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t". They are di&s;tingui&s;hed from all others, by an appointed mark or &s;ign, "their believing in him whom God hath &s;ent". Upon whom&s;oever there|fore this character is not found, they are liable to the cur&s;e of the law, and the wrath of God, not|with&s;tanding the life and death of Je&s;us the Savior; and they will accordingly be pronounced cur&s;ed, in the day of the appearing of that man, whom God has ordained judge of the world: But on whom&s;oever it is found, it may be a&s;&s;uredly &s;aid of them, they are "the ble&s;&s;ed ones who&s;e &s;ins are forgiven, to whom the Lord imputeth not iniqui|ty"; and to whom the redeemer and judge of men will &s;ay, "when he comes in the glory of his father, with the holy angels, come, ye ble&s;&s;ed of my father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world". Not that they are thus favoured and di&s;tingui&s;hed, upon the &s;core of their faith, for the &s;ake of their character as believers; but, having this character, they have the divinely con&s;tituted mark, pointing them out as the per&s;ons, whom God has been plea&s;ed to declare, &s;hall reap the benefit of that deliverance from wrath, the &s;ource of which is his own free grace, and the rea&s;on of its be&s;towment, the wor|thine&s;s of Chri&s;t, his perfect character fini&s;hed on the cro&s;s.

and the virtue of what he has done and &s;uf|fered for &s;inners. God has appointed a con|nection between faith, and the benefit of the Sa|vior's obedience and blood; in&s;omuch, that what he has done and &s;uffered is placed to the account of believers. His righteou&s;ne&s;s is, to all &s;aving purpo&s;es, the &s;ame thing to them, as if they had wro't it out them&s;elves.</P>
<P>NOR was this con&s;tituted connection between faith, and the benefit of God's grace, thro' the atonement of Chri&s;t, an arbitrary appointment; but a wi&s;ely contrived part in the plan of re|demption.</P>
<P>THE apo&s;tle Paul, &s;peaking of this matter, &s;ays, "it is therefore of faith, that it might be by grace".<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. 4.16.</NOTE> And &s;o far is faith from counter-acting the grace of God, or the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, in the bui&s;ine&s;s of ju&s;tification, that it highly exalts them both; a&s;cribing the glory to them, and not taking it to it&s;elf. The believer in Chri&s;t a&s;&s;ents to it as true, that tis not for the &s;ake of any worthine&s;s he has about him, that he is ju&s;tified and &s;aved; but for the &s;ake of ano|ther, on account of the worthine&s;s of him, who has been "the propitiation for our &s;ins". He "re|ceives it as a faithful &s;aying, and accounts it worthy of all acceptation", that it was of grace that Chri&s;t was thus made a propitiation; as it was love, pure unmerited love, that &s;ent him into the world to do the work, which he fini&s;hed by dying on the cro&s;s. And it equally &s;tands true in his mind, that his faith is of no value in it&s;elf &s;imply con&s;i|dered, and that it derives all its virtue from the
<PB N="160" REF="009925_0165_0F7B392022304220">
appointment of heaven, which has made it a ne|ce&s;&s;ary qualification in him, in order to his partak|ing of the benefit of grace thro' Chri&s;t. And who|&s;oever believes thus, exalts the grace of God, and does honor to the redeemer's obedience and blood. His faith, tho' connected with life, totally excludes all boa&s;ting. And, in truth, the connection was purpo&s;ely made, that "no fle&s;h &s;hould glory in God's pre&s;ence"; but that "he that glorieth might glory in the Lord"; as all believers do, being, by means of their faith, "in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who of God is now made unto them, wi&s;dom, and righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;anctification and redemp|tion." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. 29, 30, 31.</NOTE></P>
<P>IT ought to be con&s;idered &s;till further, it was a fit, proper thing, in point of true wi&s;dom, that there &s;hould be a "&s;ubjective capacity" in the &s;in|ner, for the enjoyment of the ble&s;&s;edne&s;s he will have an immediate right to by being ju&s;tified, before he actually is &s;o. Tho&s;e who are ju&s;tified have an immediate actual right, not only to de|liverance from wrath, but to the joys of God's pre&s;ence; in&s;omuch that, &s;hould they be in&s;tantly called out of the world, they would be admited into heaven. But how incongruous would a right to heavenly happine&s;s be, where the temper and bent of the mind is &s;uch, that there would be a total incapacity for the enjoyment of it? And yet, this would be the ca&s;e, if faith was not previ|ou&s;ly nece&s;&s;ary to our being ve&s;ted with this right. Tis this that makes the grand &s;ubjective altera|tion in the &s;inner. He is no &s;ooner po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of faith, but he has that &s;eed of God in him, which contains in it, virtually, the whole chri&s;tian temper,
<PB N="161" REF="009925_0166_0F7B39215713BAE8">
which is the true &s;cripture capacity for all &s;pritual enjoyments and employments. He is now, in the fir&s;t rudiments, a man of that "pure heart", and tho&s;e "clean hands", which fit him "to a&s;cend into the hill of the Lord, and to &s;tand in his holy place", whether we mean hereby his &s;anctuary on earth, or pre&s;ence in heaven. There is, as the apo&s;tle &s;peaks, a "meetne&s;s for the inheritance of the &s;aints in light".<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Col. 1.12.</NOTE> And it would be to little purpo&s;e to have a right to this inheritance, if we were, at the &s;ame time, incapable of enjoying it; not having been fitted herefor in the frame of our hearts. Such a right ought not to be &s;uppo&s;ed. And this &s;hows the wi&s;dom of God in &s;o contriv|ing and revealing the method of ju&s;tification, as that this go&s;pel privilege cannot be had without "the faith by which the ju&s;t do live".</P>
<P>I MAY not impertinently add here, it is by faith, as enlivened and actuated by the holy Spirit, that "redemption thro' the blood of Chri&s;t, according to the riches of God's grace", is carried into effect. Faith, operating under the divine agency, forms the &s;inner at fir&s;t into "a babe in Chri&s;t"; and by the &s;ame faith, under the conduct of the &s;ame influ|ence, he gradually grows to "the fullne&s;s of the &s;tature of a perfect man in him". Says the apo|&s;tle, "of his own will begat he us with the word of truth". <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">James 1.18.</NOTE> Agreable whereto are tho&s;e words of another apo&s;tle, "being born again by the word of God". <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. 1.22.</NOTE> And this &s;ame word of truth, by which the &s;inner is "begot", and "born a|gain", is &s;till made u&s;e of in carrying on this new workman&s;hip of God, till it is "compleat in Chri&s;t". Says our Savior, "&s;anctifie them thro'
<PB N="162" REF="009925_0167_0F7B392185CE4848">
thy truth, thy word is truth". <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John 17.17.</NOTE> And the apo&s;tle Paul &s;ays of Chri&s;t, "he loved the church, and gave him&s;elf for it, that he might &s;anctifie it by the word,&mdash;and pre&s;ent it to him&s;elf a glorious church without &s;pot, or wrinkle, or any &s;uch thing". <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eph. 5.26, 27.</NOTE> You &s;ee it is by the truth, that the new creation is both begun, and carried on; be|gun in the new-birth, and carried on in pro|gre&s;&s;ive &s;anctification. But then it is to be re|membered, it is by the truth as exi&s;ting in the mind by faith. For if it lies in the bible only, and is not received into the heart, it can have no effect. By believing the truth, it has a real being in the chri&s;tian, and becomes capable of u&s;e as a principle of operation. And by the truth, thus exi&s;ting &amp; operating in him, he makes, under the guidance of the holy Gho&s;t, all his attainments, in conformity to the image, example, and will of Je&s;us Chri&s;t Of &s;uch importance and u&s;e is faith in the &s;cheme of redeeming grace, thro' the blood of Chri&s;t. And no wonder therefore it is di&s;tingui&s;hed, by being made the grand character|i&s;tic, without which we &s;hall have no benefit, ei|ther by the life or death of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>THE &s;hort of the matter is, we can't be too much concerned, that grace and Chri&s;t may have all due honor in the affair of the &s;inner's ju&s;tifica|tion; but, under the notion of magnifying grace, and exalting Chri&s;t, we mu&s;t take care we don't reproach that wi&s;dom of God, which has &s;o con|triv'd the plan of life, as to make faith in us a nece&s;&s;ary requi&s;ite in order hereto. Grace, Chri&s;t, and faith, are all nece&s;&s;ary; and the latter as truly &s;o, as the former, tho' in a different view. With|out
<PB N="163" REF="009925_0168_0F7B39226B3ED8B8">
grace, we &s;hould never have heard of this go&s;pel privilege; without the worthine&s;s of Chri&s;t, his fini&s;hed character, as having been obedient even to death, there would not have been an ad|equate moral ground for the be&s;towment of it; and without faith, we &s;hould be wanting in that character, qualification, or di&s;tinctive mark, which the all-wi&s;e appointment of God has &s;o connected with freedom from wrath, as that, while de&s;titute of it, he has mo&s;t &s;olemnly declared, that we are in a &s;tate of condemnation. Thus faith, tho' ne|ce&s;&s;ary, is made &s;o in due &s;ubordination to the grace of God, and the perfectly meritorious obe|dience and blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.

This obedience of Chri&s;t to death is eminently, <HI>the truth, the &s;imple truth, that ju&s;tifies.</HI></Q></P>
<P>IF I know my &s;elf, I would always be in a di&s;|po&s;ition to love and thank Chri&s;t, for the great and gloriou&s;ly benevolent work he fini&s;hed on the cro&s;s; and next to the grace of God, it is, with|out all doubt, the grand requi&s;ite to ju&s;tification: Nor can we be ju&s;tified without it. Tis an e&s;&s;en|tial part in the merciful plan God has laid to &s;ave &s;inners from the damnation of hell. And it would be ba&s;e ingratitude to the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us, to

&s;ay any thing that would take from the glory due to him, when he has done and &s;uffered &s;o much, that we might be ju&s;tified and &s;aved in a way that might be honorary to the perfections and govern|ment of God. But &s;till, no truth of God, how|ever great and important, ought to be explained &s;o as to &s;et a&s;ide any other truth of his. Perfect harmony &s;ub&s;i&s;ts among all divinely revealed truths. And if we interpret one, &s;o as to oppo&s;e another, we may di&s;cover zeal for God or Chri&s;t, but it will be zeal without &s;ufficient knowledge. We can't do too much honor to the redeemer's blood, while we view it in the true point of re|vealed light: But if we would put it to a u&s;e it was never intended for, in&s;tead of honoring, we &s;hall reproach it.</P>

<P>SHOULD it be &s;aid, faith indeed is nece&s;&s;ary; but then, by faith mu&s;t be under&s;tood "the truth believed". <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">This is the PROTON PSEUDOS, the capital mi&s;take, our author has unhappily fallen into. It runs thro' all his letters, and is mingled more or le&s;s with all that he &s;ays. Tis, to me, quite &s;trange, one of his di&s;cernment &s;hould not at once &s;ee, that he impo&s;ed on him&s;elf, and his readers, in &s;peaking of "the truth to be believed", and the "belief of this truth", as one and the &s;ame thing. Surely, there is a difference be|tween "light", and "&s;eeing" light. And the differ|ence is as real, and as obviou&s;ly to be perceived, be|tween the "object of faith", and the "mind's per|&s;ua&s;ion" with reference to this object. Tis readily acknowledged, when a man gives credit to the go&s;pel-report, he becomes "po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the truth"; yea, I will add, the truth he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, if he unerringly be|lieves, will lie in his mind ju&s;t as it &s;tands in the di|vine record. But, is the truth's lying in his mind by faith, and its lying in the divine rec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rd <HI>only,</HI> the &s;ame thing? There is an e&s;&s;ential difference here; in&s;o|much, that contradictory propo&s;itions, and the mo&s;t intere&s;ting ones too, may ju&s;tly be affirmed of the &s;ame truth, in the&s;e different views of it. Damnation, aggavated damnation, may &s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ow upon the "&s;alutary truth", &s;imply or meerly as &s;uch; that is, ab&s;tracted from the per&s;ua&s;ion of a man's mind, that tis the truth; whereas, who&s;oever believes the truth, or becomes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it by faith, &s;hall a&s;&s;uredly obtain "the ju&s;tification of life". What now &s;hould be the rea&s;on of this difference? The true and only rea&s;on is, be|cau&s;e the truth, as to its MODE OF EXISTENCE, if I may &s;o &s;peak, is e&s;&s;entially different from what it was. Before the &s;inner's belief of it, it was "meerly the propo&s;ed object of faith"; but it is now "this object admited into his mind". And in this view only of the truth, is it connected, in the bible, with any &s;av|ing benefit. Tis not the truth, in it&s;elf &s;imply con|&s;idered, but AS BELIEVED, received into the mind by faith, that will avail to acceptance with God. Faith therefore, or THE TRUTH ACTUALLY BELIEVED, is as real a requi&s;ite in order to life, as the TRUTH IT|SELF. They both bear their part, and unitedly con|cur, in the affair of the &s;inner's ju&s;tification. This way of &s;peaking, perfectly falls in with the whole tenor of the new-te&s;tament-writings, upon this head. What they &s;ay of faith, and its connection with life, thus con&s;idered, is intelligible in it&s;elf, and ea&s;y to be under&s;tood by any vulgar capacity: Whereas, "if we would enter into the &s;pirit of our author's writings, upon this head, or read them with any &s;atisfaction, we mu&s;t have a new dictionary for &s;ome of the mo&s;t nota|ble words of the new-te&s;tament"; as he expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf upon another occa&s;ion, pag. 377. And, even then, we &s;hould be at a lo&s;s to make out a con&s;i&s;tency in what he &s;ays. Sometimes tis <HI>the truth,</HI> the <HI>&s;imple truth,</HI> the <HI>&s;alutary truth,</HI> the <HI>&s;aving truth,</HI> that ju&s;tifies; at other times tis <HI>faith, belief,</HI> the <HI>belief of the truth,</HI> the <HI>knowledge of the truth,</HI> the <HI>knowledge of a righteou&s;|ne&s;s fini&s;hed in the days of Tiberius:</HI> By all which phra|&s;es, if he would not be at odds with him&s;elf, he mu&s;t mean one and the &s;ame thing. And yet, tis impo&s;&s;ible, according to any known rules of language, that the <HI>&s;imple truth,</HI> the <HI>&s;aving truth,</HI> without any adjunct, &s;hould be under&s;tood in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e preci&s;ely, with the &s;ame words joined with <HI>belief</HI> or <HI>knowledge.</HI> If the&s;e additional words &s;ignifie nothing, why are they u&s;ed? If they &s;ignifie any thing, why u&s;ed as tho' they meant nothing? The truth is, it was nece&s;&s;ary our author &s;hould, every now and then, bring in the words <HI>faith, belief of the truth, knowing the truth,</HI> and the like; becau&s;e, otherwi&s;e, he would too vi&s;ibly have thrown contempt on the &s;acred books, in which the u&s;e of them is both common, and infinitely intere&s;ting. But do they u&s;e them, in the &s;en&s;e he under&s;tands them? No: But as pointing out, and directly aiming to point out, a REAL AND ESSENTIAL DIFFERENCE between the truth con&s;idered "as the object of faith", and this object AS BELIEVED, actually admited into the mind. Nor is the new-te&s;tament doctrine, concerning faith, intelligible, upon any other plan of interpretation. It certainly is not upon our author's. I &s;hall briefly illu&s;trate this, by one or two in&s;tances.&mdash;The apo&s;tle Peter profe&s;&s;es, in the name of the other apo&s;tles, as well as his own, John 6.69. "we believe, and are &s;ure, that thou art Chri&s;t, the &s;on of the living God". The &s;cripture &s;imply affirms, "that Je&s;us is the Chri&s;t, the &s;on of the living God". I would now a&s;k, is there no difference between this profe&s;&s;ion, and affirmation? Tis obvious, at the fir&s;t glance, that the "affirma|tion" contains the truth "meerly as &s;uch", &amp; nothing el&s;e. And tis as plain, that the "profe&s;&s;ion", be|&s;ides this, takes in another idea quite di&s;tinct, &amp; differ|ent; and that is, the "exi&s;tence of this truth in the minds of the apo&s;tles". And I would add here, "the per&s;ua&s;ion of their minds", with reference to this truth, was as truly nece&s;&s;ary, tho' not in the &s;ame view, to denominate their profe&s;&s;ion acceptable in God's &s;ight, as "the truth it&s;elf" that was the object of this per|&s;ua&s;ion. They both concured in the matter; nor, without this concurence, would their profe&s;&s;ion have been of any &s;ignificancy to any &s;piritual purpo&s;e.&mdash; The &s;cripture declares, "that Chri&s;t is the only be|gotten &s;on of God, whom he &s;ent into the world that &s;inners might live, and not die". It declares likewi&s;e, "that WHOSOEVER BELIEVETH in God's only be|gotten &s;on, &s;hall not die, but live". Upon comparing the&s;e declarations, will any one deliberately &s;ay, that the "latter" means no more than the "former"? That they both convey, and were intended to convey, the &s;ame ideas? If an infinitely intere&s;ting difference can't be di&s;covered between them, it mu&s;t be owing to the want of &s;ight, and not becau&s;e it is not as clear|ly and di&s;tinctly expre&s;&s;ed, as words can do it. Upon our author's &s;cheme, no one can give a meaning to any of tho&s;e texts, which connect &s;alvation with faith. He is him&s;elf quite unequal to the difficult ta&s;k. He is accordingly led, whether &s;en&s;ible of it, or not, to confute him&s;elf, even while illu&s;trating his grand point, namely, that tis by "the &s;imple truth", the truth that is "the object of faith", and by nothing in connection with it, that the &s;inner is ju&s;tified. Says he, pag. 11.
<Q>what Chri&s;t hath done, is that which plea&s;eth God; what he hath done, is that which quiets the guilty con&s;cience, &s;o &s;oon as HE KNOWS IT: So that whenever he hears of it, he has no occa&s;ion for any other que&s;tion but this, is it true? IF HE FINDS IT TRUE, he is happy; if not, be can reap no comfort by it.</Q>
Tis at once obvious, that he here makes a DIFFERENCE between "what Chri&s;t hath done that is plea&s;ing to God", and a man's KNOWING or BE|LIEVING this; between "the truth it&s;elf", and HIS FINDING IT TO BE TRUE&punc; That is, in plain words, he would give us to under&s;tand, tho' tis true, that "what Chri&s;t has done, is plea&s;ing to God"; yet, if a man does not KNOW this to be true, if it is not A TRUTH TO HIM, as well as a truth in it&s;elf, he can reap no comfort by it. And what is this, in reality of &s;en&s;e, but to &s;ay, ju&s;t as others do, that what Chri&s;t did, however plea&s;ing to God, will be of no &s;aving advantage to any man, unle&s;s he has faith, that is, is per&s;uaded in his mind, that this which is &s;poken of, as truth, in the divine &s;ecord&punc; really is &s;o. There are many other pa&s;&s;ages, in which our author makes as great a DIFFERENCE between the truth "merely in it&s;elf", and "as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by faith", as others do; and this too, while he is proving there is no difference at all. In &s;hort, none have more gro&s;ly "put the change upon them&s;elves, by &s;hifting words and names, than he has done in this matter", if I may return him his own compliment.</NOTE> Tis nor our belief, but "what we

But whenever it is thus u&s;ed, tis in a figurative and le&s;s proper &s;en&s;e. Should we interpret &s;aith, or belief, as always &s;ignifying the object of faith, or, what our au|thor calls "the &s;imple truth", we &s;hould, at once, &s;trip a great number of texts of all meaning. I &s;hall briefly mention one or two by way of &s;pecimen. When our Savior preached, &s;aying, "believe the go&s;pel"; if, by believing is under&s;tood the object of faith, that is, "the go&s;pel", what imaginable &s;en&s;e can be put upon his words? I freely acknowledge my own incapacity to give them any: Whereas, if we explain them as a call to his hearers to a&s;&s;ent to "the go&s;pel" which he preached, to admit it into their minds as the truth of God, there is, at once, an ea&s;y and important mean|ing given to them. In like manner, when the apo|&s;tles preached, as they were commi&s;&s;ioned to do, "he that believeth &s;hall be &s;aved, but he that believeth not &s;hall be damned"; we &s;hall meet with the &s;ame diffi|culty, in affixing any &s;en&s;e to what they &s;aid. If belief &s;tands here to &s;ignifie preci&s;ely the &s;ame thing with "the &s;imple truth", the object of faith, no man alive can paraphra&s;e the words &s;o as to make them &s;peak &s;en&s;e. If it be &s;aid, the phra&s;es, "he that believ|eth", and "he that believeth not", are to be interpret|ed, as pointing out tho&s;e, who admit the object of faith, "the &s;imple truth", into their minds, and tho&s;e who do not; this, it is owned, gives a &s;en&s;e, and an highly important one, to them; and it is the very &s;en&s;e that is intended to be conveyed by them: But tis not po&s;&s;ible, this &s;en&s;e, or indeed any other, &s;hould be put upon them, if belief means exactly the &s;ame thing with "the truth &s;imply in it&s;elf". I &s;hall &s;ubjoin here, notwith&s;tanding what has been &s;aid above, perhaps, in mo&s;t of the places, if not in all, where we are &s;aid to be "ju&s;tified by faith", and not by "the works of the law", we are to under&s;tand by "faith", the "go&s;pel", in oppo&s;ition to "law". So, when we are &s;ometimes &s;aid to be "ju&s;tified by faith", where "law" is not particularly mentioned, the mean|ing may be the &s;ame, namely, that we are "ju&s;tified" upon the foot of "go&s;pel", upon the "&s;cheme of mercy revealed by Je&s;us Chri&s;t". But then it ought carefully to be minded, we cannot, in con&s;i&s;tency with many expre&s;s texts of &s;cripture, be "ju&s;tified upon the go&s;pel-plan", but by "believing" in the &s;trict pro|per &s;en&s;e of the word, that is, by admiting this plan into our minds as the truth of God. Tis as &s;ure a truth of "the faith of Je&s;us Chri&s;t", meaning hereby his go&s;pel, that we &s;hall be "damned if we don't be|lieve", as it is that "he died for our offences, and ro&s;e again for our ju&s;tification". The "truth as it is in Je&s;us" mu&s;t be admited into our minds, and ex|i&s;t a reality there, or we &s;hall receive no advantage either from his death, or re&s;urrection.</NOTE> that is, to be ju&s;tified

by faith is to be ju&s;tified by Chri&s;t's blood which is the truth": It would &s;ignifie nothing, I &s;ay, to argue thus, for tho' faith and the truth are &s;ometimes promi&s;cuou&s;ly u&s;ed, tis in the figura|tive &s;en&s;e, and not &s;trictly and properly. The a&s;&s;ent of a man's mind to revealed truth, is a
<PB N="171" REF="009925_0176_0F7B3929F60208D8">
quite different thing from the truth it&s;elf, that is the object of his a&s;&s;ent. It becomes indeed a truth to him by this a&s;&s;ent; but &s;till, the truth it&s;elf, and that per&s;ua&s;ion of mind, in con&s;equence of which it exi&s;ts in him, in this point of view, are di&s;tinct things. That Chri&s;t "died for &s;in, the ju&s;t for the unju&s;t", is a truth plainly te&s;ti|fied to in the &s;cripture, and will be a truth, whether it be admited into my mind as &s;uch, or not; but it mu&s;t be thus admited, it mu&s;t &s;tand true in my mind, or I can have no &s;aving benefit from it. That we are "ju&s;tified by Chri&s;t's blood", is one of the mo&s;t important revealed truths; but I mu&s;t believe it, it mu&s;t be a truth in my mind, before I can be ju&s;tified by it. To be "ju&s;tified by faith", and to be "ju&s;tified by Chri&s;t's blood", can't therefore mean preci&s;ely the &s;ame thing: Nor ought they ever to be &s;o explained; but as jointly concur|ing
<PB N="172" REF="009925_0177_0F7B392A7B3F2128">
with each other. On the one hand, to be "ju&s;tified by Chri&s;t's blood", if interpreted in con&s;i&s;tency with other &s;acred texts, will mean the &s;ame thing with being "ju&s;tified by faith in his blood", including both the truth, and our faith in it; for they are both nece&s;&s;ary. Both the blood of Chri&s;t, and its being true in the &s;in|ner's mind that he has &s;hed his blood, mu&s;t concur in order to his being ju&s;tified. On the other hand, "to be ju&s;tified by faith", if explain|ed in a ju&s;t con&s;i&s;tency with other in&s;pired texts, will mean, not only that the truth believed, Chri&s;t's blood, is nece&s;&s;ary to ju&s;tification, &s;o ne|ce&s;&s;ary that tis not obtainable without it; but that the per&s;ua&s;ion of mind with reference to this truth, &s;ignified by faith, has its u&s;e al&s;o; in&s;o|much, that where this is wanting, even the blood of Chri&s;t will not avail to &s;ave the &s;inner from going to hell. Says the apo&s;tle Paul, &s;peaking of him&s;elf, and other believers, "knowing that a man is not ju&s;tified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, even we have believed in Chri&s;t, that we might be ju&s;tified by the faith of Chri&s;t". Surely, his meaning, in the&s;e words, is not, that the object of faith only is nece&s;&s;ary in order to ju&s;tification. If faith, under&s;tanding by it, the mind's per&s;ua&s;ion with reference to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and his fini&s;hed work, was of no u&s;e, of no &s;ervice, in the bui&s;ine&s;s of the &s;inner's ju&s;tification, why does he &s;ay with &s;o much particularity, "we have believed that we might be ju&s;tified"? Their believing in Chri&s;t was a needle&s;s thing, to be &s;ure it was &s;o re&s;pecting their ju&s;tification, if they might have been ju&s;ti|fied without this belief.</P>

It may, under the influ|ence of the divine &s;pirit, operate to change his heart, to change the objects of his pa&s;&s;ions and affections, and to renew his whole inner and outer-man: But it can do nothing towards his ju&s;tification. For the change which ju&s;tifica|tion makes in the &s;inner is relative, not real. It changes him from an object of wrath to an object of God's favor.

obnoxious to death. And there is no way in which this can be done but by a divine con&s;titu|tion. And if, according to this con&s;titution, a belief of the truth is nece&s;&s;ary, then the truth &s;e|parate, or apart, from this belief, can't do it; but they do it in concurence with each other. So God has made the connection between believed truth, and a ju&s;tified &s;tate.

or character. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Our author will, doubtle&s;s, e&s;teem it highly heretical in any to &s;ay, that a real difference in men's character mu&s;t take place before they can be ju&s;tified; and that they are ju&s;tified in this point of view, that is, as being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a character which makes an e&s;&s;ential difference between them, and &s;inners in com|mon: But this is undoubtedly the truth; nor other|wi&s;e could they be ju&s;tified upon the go&s;pel-plan. If the expre&s;s words of revelation are worth minding, tis beyond all di&s;pute evident, that no man can be in a &s;tate of acceptance with God, till he is a BELIEVER. And it is as evident, if words are any thing more than unmeaning words, that a man's being a believer DISTINGUISHES him from all that are not, and fixes an ESSENTIAL DIFFERENCE between his character, and their's. Men's being believers, or unbelievers, is in|deed the GRAND DISTINCTION, the &s;cripture makes between them; and it is &s;o intere&s;ting, that &s;alvation or damnation depend upon it. Our author is plea&s;ed to &s;ay page 287. "that the go&s;pel con&s;iders all whom it relieves as guilty and unworthy, de&s;titute of righ|teou&s;ne&s;s and every qualification and recommendation, perfectly on a level with all their fellow-creatures, and &s;eeing no difference betwixt them&s;elves and tho&s;e that eternally peri&s;h &mdash;When it fir&s;t &s;peaks peace to them, it intimates no difference betwixt them and others". If he had been &s;peaking here of &s;inners, as they were viewed by God, when he purpo&s;ed, contri|ved and revealed the go&s;pel-method of life, tis readily own'd they were all de&s;titute of every qualification, and without di&s;tinction the children of wrath. It was "while they were &s;inners", and as &s;uch de|&s;erving death, that "God commended his love to|wards them", in opening the go&s;pel-&s;cheme of hope. But to &s;ay, that there is no difference between the <HI>character</HI> of "tho&s;e that eternally peri&s;h", &amp; tho&s;e that are "relieved by the go&s;pel", at the &s;ame time when "it &s;peaks peace to them", and that it "intimates no difference betwixt them", is gro&s;ly and boldly to con|tradict the &s;acred writers of the new-te&s;tament. Can a man, upon the foot of the go&s;pel-revelation, be re|lieved and comforted, while an unbeliever in Je&s;us Chri&s;t? If he can, he may have relief, and enjoy com|fort, at the very time he is actually in a &s;tate of dam|nation; for the &s;cripture directly affirms, John 3.36. "he that believeth not the &s;on,&mdash;the wrath of God abideth on him". But if tis nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould believe, before he can be relieved and comforted&punc; he mu&s;t then be a <HI>different</HI> man from what he was, and &s;o different as to differ from all unbelievers in the world. God views him in this light, when he &s;peaks peace to him; and he mu&s;t view him&s;elf as God does, or he can find no relief upon the foundation of Chri&s;t and the apo&s;tles. Tis true, a man, when he becomes a believer, will &s;ee his own unworthine&s;s and &s;inful|ne&s;s, in a far &s;tronger light than he did before; in&s;o|much that he will be filled with admiration at the in|finitely rich grace of God in contriving and revealing a way, wherein &s;uch a guilty unde&s;erving creature &s;hould be admited to mercy: and he will al&s;o &s;ee, in the like &s;trong point of light, that tis not in the vir|tue of his being a believer, that he may comfort him|&s;elf in hope: He will look beyond every thing in him|&s;elf, to "the work of Chri&s;t", as the true rea&s;on, the &s;ole meritorious ground, upon which he is accepted of God. But &s;till, he mu&s;t view him&s;elf, not &s;imply as a &s;inner, but a <HI>believing</HI> &s;inner, and in this re&s;pect <HI>different</HI> from &s;inners in common, or he can find no relief from the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t. It may argue our author's being gro&s;ly incon&s;i&s;tent with him&s;elf to &s;ay, that he no more than tho&s;e he treats with contempt, will allow any man to be relieved by the go&s;pel, till there is a wide difference between him and other &s;inners; and yet, this is the real truth. He &s;ays, page 286. "the &s;cripture will keep us in coun|tenance, if we &s;hould affirm, that no man <HI>before he believes</HI> can have any ground of hope, but what is fictitious and vain". And, in the next page, "there can be no true piety nor good hope, but what <HI>follows upon faith</HI>". Faith then, our author being judge, is previous to, and mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily go before, piety and hope, or they will both be fal&s;e and vain. And a man's relief from the go&s;pel will be like his piety and hope, a vain imagination, unle&s;s it is preceded by faith. And, as our author makes hope, comfort, and in|deed every thing, in real chri&s;tianity, to <HI>follow</HI> upon faith; &s;o does he make the man that has faith, a <HI>quite different</HI> man from what he was, and from all unbe|lievers whatever. According to his mode of &s;peaking, no man can be a believer, &s;o as to be &s;avingly relieved, to whom "the work of Chri&s;t" is not "the truth"; who don't "find it to be the truth"; who don't "po&s;&s;e&s;s, know and under&s;tand it": Nor can a man either po&s;&s;e&s;s, know, or under&s;tand it, if it don't in|&s;pire him "with love to it", a love that will &s;hew its reality in all in&s;tances of "&s;elf-deny'd obedience": Yea, no man can know the truth in whom it is not "a principle of life", analagous to that which deno|minated Lazarus one alive from the dead. If this is a ju&s;t account of one that is a believer, mu&s;t he not be a quite <HI>different</HI> man from what he was? Can it, with the lea&s;t &s;hadow of truth, be &s;aid, that there is no di&s;tinction between his character, and their's who will finally peri&s;h? Is there no difference between the man, "into who&s;e mind God has &s;hined with the light of his glory in the face of Je&s;us Chri&s;t", and tho&s;e blinded &s;inners, who &s;till "&s;it in darkne&s;s, and the region of the &s;hadow of death"? Is there no difference between the man, who has had planted in his heart, by the power of the holy Gho&s;t, "a prin|ciple of life", and tho&s;e, concerning whom the &s;crip|ture &s;ays, "they are dead while they live"? One mu&s;t put out his eyes not to &s;ee an e&s;&s;ential difference be|tween believers and others, as to their real character. Our author &s;ometimes plainly &s;aw, and as plainly de&s;cribed, this difference; tho', at other times, he keeps it out of &s;ight, and &s;peaks as tho' there was no differ|ence at all.</NOTE> This we have &s;een to be as evi|dent a truth as any in the &s;acred books of &s;crip|ture. And if God has revealed this as a go&s;pel-truth, for any to &s;ay, that di&s;honor is hereby reflected on the obedience and blood of Chri&s;t, is, in reality of con&s;truction, to reproach God.
<PB N="176" REF="009925_0181_0F7B392F46EE8D28">
And it would indeed be a reproach to Chri&s;t al&s;o, to introduce his blood as operating to the &s;inner's ju&s;tification, in a way that God has not appoint|ed. "The fooli&s;hne&s;s of God is wi&s;er than men"; and "the wi&s;dom of this world" is always found, in the end, to be fooli&s;hne&s;s with God". If God
<PB N="177" REF="009925_0182_0F7B392FCE5426E0">
has made it nece&s;&s;ary, that the &s;inner &s;hould be a believer, that is, a different man from what he was, and from what all other men are, before he &s;hall be ju&s;tified, or, what means the &s;ame thing, before he &s;hall reap &s;aving benefit by the obedi|ence and blood of Chri&s;t, we &s;hall give all due

honor to this "fini&s;hed work" of his, while we con&s;ider it as available to the ju&s;tification of the believing &s;inner only. We now give it its pro|per u&s;e, and &s;hould di&s;grace, rather than honor it, &s;hould we extend its u&s;e, and attribute a &s;uffi|ciency to it to a purpo&s;e God never de&s;igned it for.</P>
<P>THE plain truth is, God's making faith, in us, previou&s;ly nece&s;&s;ary to our receiving &s;aving bene|fit by Chri&s;t's obedience and blood, is the con|trivance of infinite wi&s;dom; and, far from eclip|&s;ing the glory due to Chri&s;t, it is the be&s;t con|ceivable method, by which he might have the whole glory a&s;cribed to him that is his due, in the great affair of the &s;inner's ju&s;tification. For let it be con&s;idered, it is by faith that the &s;inner beholds him&s;elf, in the &s;tronge&s;t point of light, as an undone wretch, unworthy of the divine
<PB N="179" REF="009925_0184_0F7B39329D05FE20">
notice, and a fit object of wrath. It is by faith, that the only way is opened to his view, wherein God may &s;hew mercy to him, and at the &s;ame time di&s;cover him&s;elf to be glorious, both in his holine&s;s and ju&s;tice. It is by faith, he is kept from a&s;cribing his deliverance from wrath and hell to his own de&s;erts, and is di&s;po&s;ed and in|fluenced to carry his tho'ts up to the riches of divine grace, as the true &s;ource of this ble&s;&s;ing, and the perfect character of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, compleated by his death, as the true rea&s;on of its be&s;towment. Tho' he is in a ju&s;tified &s;tate, his faith teaches him, with adoring humility and thankfulne&s;s, to acknowlege that he was bro't into it "freely of God's grace, thro' the redemp|tion there is in Chri&s;t". His faith won't &s;uffer him to look upon faith in any view, but that of a divinely appointed medium of putting him into the enjoyment of a ble&s;&s;ing, which was wholly owing to the grace of God, and the redeemer's worthine&s;s. His faith in&s;tructs and enables him to argue, I am, being a believer, an object of the divine favor; but I became &s;o, not in the virtue of this character, not for the &s;ake of it, but be|cau&s;e the good God was plea&s;ed of his meer grace to connect this character with the benefit of his &s;on's blood. His faith directs him, not|with&s;tanding his being a believer, to e&s;teem him|&s;elf, comparing him&s;elf with law and ju&s;tice, as a &s;inner in common with the re&s;t of mankind, and worthy of nothing but the divine wrath; and to attribute it to meer mercy, that his faith, by the go&s;pel-con&s;titution, intere&s;ts him in the everla&s;ting advantages that re&s;ult from the obe|dience of Chri&s;t to the death of the cro&s;s. This is the influence of faith. And wherein could
<PB N="180" REF="009925_0185_0F7B3933B9E56558">
God have contrived a more effectual method to &s;ecure to him&s;elf, the honor of his own grace; and to his &s;on Je&s;us Chri&s;t the honor of his work as redeemer, than by making it nece&s;&s;ary, that the &s;inner &s;hould be a believer, previous to his obtaining the ju&s;tification of life? The utmo&s;t care is taken by this method to "hide pride from man", by filling him with the deepe&s;t &s;en&s;e of his own unworthine&s;s, and the mo&s;t exalted ap|prehen&s;ions of God's grace, and the Savior's righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>SERMON VII. Human Endeavours, in the U&s;e of Means, the Way in which Faith is obtained.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>GALATIANS II. 16.</BIBL>
<P>"Knowing that a man is not ju&s;tified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, even we have believed in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that we might be ju&s;ti|fied by the faith of Chri&s;t"&mdash;.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE la&s;t time I &s;pake from the&s;e words, I opened to you the go&s;pel-connection be|tween the &s;inner's believing, and his being ju&s;tified. And it appeared, that they were in&s;epa|rably conjoin'd. There cannot be the one with|out the other. So &s;ure as a man becomes a be|liever, &s;o &s;ure is he put into a &s;tate of &s;afety, re|&s;pecting the eternal world; and &s;o &s;ure as he re|mains de&s;titute of faith, &s;o &s;ure is he liable to the cur&s;e of the law, and the wrath of God.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="009925_0187_0F7B3934FB95E030">THIS being the truth, a mo&s;t intere&s;ting que|&s;tion naturally ari&s;es from it, in regard of tho&s;e, who, thro' the want of faith, are in a &s;tate of ex|po&s;edne&s;s to the "&s;econd death". It is this.</P>
<P>HOW &s;hall we obtain faith? Are we to do any thing, or u&s;e any means, in order to the obtain|ment of it?</P>
<P>THE an&s;wer &s;ome would give is,
<Q>that faith comes not by any human endeavours, or the u&s;e of any means, even under the greate&s;t ad|vantages men enjoy; but God be&s;tows it with|out any exertments of our's, all which are u&s;e|le&s;s, and &s;erve rather to prevent, than promote, the obtainment of it.</Q></P>
<P>BUT, &s;urely, this is an an&s;wer that has no &s;olid foundation in the word of God. When Simon, the &s;orcerer, made it evident to the apo&s;tle Peter, that he was not a &s;ubject of the faith that is &s;av|ing, did he thereupon advi&s;e him to the u&s;e of no endeavours, no means, in order to his getting into a better &s;tate? Far from this, his direction is, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts 8.22.</NOTE> "repent, and pray God, if perhaps the tho't of thine heart may be forgiven thee". Would he have thus directed one, that was not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the "&s;aving truth", if he had nothing to do, in order to his becoming po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it? He mu&s;t have tho't it proper, that &s;inners, who, at pre&s;ent, are de&s;titute of &s;aving faith", &s;hould yet exert them&s;elves, in the u&s;e of means, in order to ob|tain it; or he would not have exhorted this &s;in|ner to the u&s;e of "prayer", and endeavours "to repent". If he could have done nothing towards
<PB N="183" REF="009925_0188_0F7B3935DF075818">
a compliance with this direction, or if what he could have done would have been of no u&s;e, to no purpo&s;e, as to any &s;piritual advantage, why was it given to him? It mu&s;t needs appear, in this view, little better than an officious imperti|nent application to him. And when the jailor fell down, in a trembling condition, before Paul and Silas, and inquired, "&s;irs, what mu&s;t I do to be &s;aved"? Did they tell him his concern was needle&s;s? His que&s;tion impertinent? He had nothing to do? No; but they an&s;wer in tho&s;e words, "believe in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and thou &s;halt be &s;aved".<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts 16.31.</NOTE> Without all doubt, they imagined he both could, and ought to, do &s;ome|thing, relative to this bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ine&s;s of faith: Other|wi&s;e, the direction they gave them can have no intelligible meaning.</P>
<P>NOR did our Savior ever teach men, that they could do nothing towards obtaining that faith which is unto life. He &s;ays indeed, "no man can come to me except the father, which hath &s;ent me, draw him". <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Joh. 6.44.</NOTE> And the apo&s;tle Paul &s;peaks of faith as "the gift of God". <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eph. 2.8.</NOTE> But nei|ther Chri&s;t, nor Paul, nor any of the Apo&s;tles, lead us to think, that faith is the be&s;towment of God, &s;o as to prevent all endeavours of our's; much le&s;s &s;o as to &s;et them a&s;ide as totally u&s;e|le&s;s and vain. The commands in the new-te&s;ta|ment to believe in Chri&s;t; the promi&s;es encou|raging men to do &s;o, and the threatnings denouncing damnation, aggravated damnation, again&s;t tho&s;e that will not be per&s;uaded to believe the truth, but go on to practice unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, are &s;o many evident proofs, that they are con&s;i|dered
<PB N="184" REF="009925_0189_0F7B39367ADEA5F0">
as agents, and accountable ones too, in the bui&s;ine&s;s of faith; which they could not be, if their own activity was wholly excluded, and God only, in oppo&s;ition to them, and all exert|ments of their's, was the giver of faith.</P>
<P>WHEN our Savior took occa&s;ion, from that exhortation, he had given his hearers "work (&s;o it is in the original) for the meat that endures to everla&s;ting life," <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John 6.27.</NOTE> and from the que&s;tion they thereupon a&s;kt him, "what &s;hall we do that we may work the works of God"? <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 28.</NOTE> I &s;ay, when he took occa&s;ion from hence to tell them? <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 29.</NOTE> "This is the work of God (the work God ex|pects and requires you &s;hould work,) that ye believe on him whom he hath &s;ent"; one would readily be inclined to &s;uppo&s;e, that they had &s;omething to do with reference to faith. It would be unnatural, to an high degree, to &s;ay, the purport of his direction to them was this, do nothing, &s;it &s;till, and wait, till it &s;hall plea&s;e God to work the work of faith in you. He mu&s;t do all in this matter, no exertments of your's are nece&s;&s;ary; they are rather u&s;ele&s;s and unprofita|ble. And yet, this mu&s;t be our Savior's mean|ing, in real implication, if there is no concurence of man in the be&s;towment of faith.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">See what is further &s;aid upon this text, under a note &s;ome pages forward.</NOTE></P>
<P>WHEN he preached, &s;aying, "repent ye, and believe the go&s;pel", <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Mark. 1.15.</NOTE> had he it in view to inform his hearers, that he neither required, or expect|ed, they &s;hould do any other than fold their

hands together, and quietly wait, till God, with|out any concern or care of their's, had wro't faith in their hearts? And yet, this mu&s;t be the true import of what he preached, if it be a doctrine of his, that God, in the be&s;towment of faith, prevents all endeavours of our's.</P>
<P>WHEN he commi&s;&s;ioned his apo&s;tles to "go into all the world, and preach, he that believeth &s;hall be &s;aved, but he that believeth not &s;hall be damned",<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 paragraph"></NOTE> was it his intention, that they &s;hould declare to mankind in his name, that if, while they carele&s;ly &s;at &s;till, doing nothing, God &s;hould be&s;tow upon them the gift of faith, they &s;hould be &s;aved; otherwi&s;e they &s;hould be damned? Would &s;uch a con&s;truction do honor to the com|mi&s;&s;ion, with which he charged his apo&s;tles? And yet, if all human endeavours to obtain faith are totally in&s;ignificant, and God gives it without them, or rather to the ca&s;ting contempt on them, this is, in reality of &s;en&s;e, the true meaning of the go&s;pel, he employed his apo&s;tles to preach to the world.</P>
<P>WHEN, in an&s;wer to John's que&s;tion, "art thou he that &s;hould come"? <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Matth. 11.3.</NOTE> he &s;aid to the two di&s;ciples that bro't it, <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 4, 5.</NOTE> "go and &s;hew John tho&s;e things which ye do &s;ee and hear; the blind re|ceive their &s;ight, and the lame walk, the lepers are clean&s;ed, and the deaf hear, the dead are rai|&s;ed up, and the poor have the go&s;pel preached to them": When, I &s;ay, he &s;ent this an&s;wer, did he mean to in&s;inuate, that neither John, nor his di&s;|ciples, had any bui&s;ine&s;s to con&s;ider this evidence of his being the Me&s;&s;iah, or to u&s;e any care or

And yet, this mu&s;t be the &s;en&s;e, if, in con&s;equence of the&s;e mighty works, nothing could be done, or was requi&s;ite to be done, towards this repentance, by either of the&s;e people; and God was to do all without them And when he goes on to &s;ay, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 21, 22.</NOTE> "wo unto you Chorazin, wo unto you Beth&s;aida, it &s;hall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment, than for you"; does he mean, that they de&s;erved for their infidelity, and would, on account of it, have inflicted on them, a heavier puni&s;hment than tho&s;e &s;inners, God tho't fit to de&s;troy by fire from heaven for their heinous crimes, when it was ab&s;olutely out of their

The "mi&s;&s;ion of a Savior", and the "providing the truth to be believ|ed", are every where repre&s;ented, in the &s;acred books, as the SOLE work of God, his work ABSOLUTELY, in oppo&s;ition to all &s;kill, will, and endeavours of men, in any view whatever. But tis quite otherwi&s;e in re|gard of believing. This is con&s;idered, in the in&s;pired writings, as a matter in which men are ACCOUNTA|BLE AGENTS; and may, as &s;uch, incur the charge of guilt, and become expo&s;ed to the "damnation of hell", in the mo&s;t heightened &s;en&s;e. But, with what propriety could men be con&s;idered as AGENTS in the affair of faith? Or with what face of ju&s;tice, or equity, could they be liable to the heavie&s;t damnation for the want of it, if their being endowed with it was the work of God, &s;o as to &s;et a&s;ide all tho't or care of their's, and all endeavours they could employ, in the u&s;e of any means, in order to the obtainment of it? Tis incredible, that men &s;hould undergo the fore&s;t puni&s;hment for their unbelief, if faith is of God as much without all human concurence, as his gracious purpo&s;e from eternity to provide a Savior to die for them. If this is true, they might as equitably and ju&s;tly be damned for not "providing a Savior" for them&s;elves, as for not believing in him now he is pro|vided, and revealed as an object to be believed on. The plain truth is, &s;o much of man mu&s;t be allowed in the acquirement of faith, as to give a real, as well as equitable and righteous, meaning to tho&s;e nume|rous &s;ayings, not only of the apo&s;tles, but of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which ca&s;t the blame upon men them&s;elves, if they remain in unbelief, and doom them to the hote&s;t place in hell for their wilful ob&s;tinacy hereby di&s;|covered. But this, mo&s;t certainly, is impo&s;&s;ible to be done, if all human tho't, care, and exertments in every view, are as much excluded from the acquirement of faith, and with as much truth, as from "providing and &s;ending Chri&s;t", thro' whom alone we can be &s;aved from peri&s;hing, and have everla&s;ting life. It would be &s;hockingly ab&s;urd to &s;ay, that men might be chargeable with &s;in for not "provi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng the grand thing to be believed"; or that they might be ju&s;tly damned for not doing it. And why? Becau&s;e this is the SOLE work of God, his work ab&s;olutely without man, in any &s;en&s;e whatever. And what &s;hould be the rea&s;on, that tis not equally ab&s;urd to &s;ay, that men may be chargeable with &s;in, and &s;o as to de&s;erve the heavie&s;t damnation, for not "believing the record God has given of his &s;on"? No conceivable rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;igned for this difference, but that they have "&s;omething to do" with reference to faith; whereas they had "nothing to do" as to providing the object to be believed. A pious zeal to exalt the grace of God, by &s;inking man into nothing, may be the pre|tence for making faith the work of God, to the exclu|&s;ion of "all human endeavours, or the u&s;e of any means, even under the greate&s;t advantages men can enjoy"; but it ought &s;eriou&s;ly to be con&s;idered, whe|ther if we reduce men to ab&s;olute nothings in the affair of faith, that is, if we repre&s;ent it to be God's work, &s;o as utterly to &s;et a&s;ide all tho't, or care, or endeavours of their's, of any &s;ort, or in any view what|ever, we &s;hall not, in true con&s;equence, nullifie all the &s;cripture-commands that require them to believe; rendering their unbelief an innocent thing, for which they ought not to be puni&s;ht, nor indeed can be, un|le&s;s that is done which is unfit and unrighteous. Can it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that men &s;hould be called upon by God to do that which is "his work", and in &s;uch a &s;en&s;e as that all doing of their's, with reference to it, in any &s;hape, would be impertinent? Can it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that they &s;hould be puni&s;hable for not doing that which is God's work, to the intire exclu&s;ion of every thing in them, relative to it, not excepting "the re|mote&s;t wi&s;h of their heart"? All I contend for is, that there may be &s;o much of man, in the bui&s;ine&s;s of faith, as to make &s;en&s;e of the &s;cripture, when it &s;peaks of UNBELIEF as a &s;in that &s;hall be more intolerably puni&s;ht, than the abominable uncleane&s;s of Sodom; and to ju&s;tifie the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God herein.</NOTE> Is it credible,

<P>I AM free to own, notwith&s;tanding all that has been &s;aid, that God is &s;ometimes "found of tho&s;e who &s;ought him not". <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I here u&s;e the&s;e words in the &s;en&s;e, in which our author would interpret them; tho', perhaps, it differs from that which is expre&s;&s;ive of the true meaning of the prophet I&s;aiah, (chap. 65.1.) from whom they are taken. Says the great Mr. How, in his "ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of the righteous", pag. 282.
<Q>The prophet is, in this text, foretelling the calling of the Gentiles; who, while they remained &s;uch, did not, tis true, enquire after God: But then, he expre&s;ly fir&s;t tells us, per|&s;onating God,
<Q>I am &s;ought of them that a&s;ked not for me,</Q>
that is, after the go&s;pel came among them: And then tis added,
<Q>I am found (<HI>upon this &s;eeking</HI> plainly) of them that &s;ought me not,</Q>
that is, of tho&s;e who once, in their former darkne&s;s, before I revealed my&s;elf in the go&s;pel-di&s;pen&s;ation to them, "&s;ought me not". As if he had &s;aid, I am now &s;ought of a people that lately &s;ought me not, nor a&s;ked of me; and I am found of them. But what is this to thy ca&s;e, whom God hath been, in the go&s;pel, earne&s;tly inviting to &s;eek after him, and thou, all this while, refu&s;e&s;t to comply with the invitation</Q>?</NOTE> So he is in the "king|dom of nature", and in the "kingdom of grace" al&s;o. There is, in this re&s;pect, an analogy in the divine conduct, in both the&s;e kingdoms. That providential government, which concerns it&s;elf particularly for man, &s;ometimes prevents all human &s;kill &amp; indu&s;try in tho&s;e di&s;coveries, which &s;erve for the accommodation of life.
<Q>The polar
<PB N="193" REF="009925_0198_0F7B393FFA3D7450">
direction of the magnet obtruded it&s;elf upon the fir&s;t di&s;coverer, when he was in que&s;t of no &s;uch thing, being occupied in &s;ome very differ|ent inquiry.</Q>
And it is &s;ometimes &s;een, that favorable turns in providence, unfore&s;een, un|tho't of, by the per&s;ons benefited by them, con|&s;titute the great difference there is between them, and others, as to their after-&s;ituation and circum|&s;tances in the world. And thus it is &s;ometimes in that &s;piritual government, which God exerci|&s;es over men. It was previous to any endea|vours of Saul, afterwards Paul, and indeed pre|ventive of any wi&s;h in his heart, that he was &s;uddenly and &s;urpri&s;ingly changed, from a per&s;e|cutor of Chri&s;t, into a believer in him. And there may have been in&s;tances of profligate and debauched &s;inners, who have as &s;uddenly (if not in the like &s;urpri&s;ing manner) been changed into good men, thro' faith in him whom God has &s;ent to be the Savior of a peri&s;hing world. But will any pretend, tis a needle&s;s u&s;ele&s;s thing for men to employ their tho'ts, or time, or hands, about temporal affairs, becau&s;e it &s;ometimes plea|&s;es God, without their &s;kill, indu&s;try, or will, to do that which greatly tends to their accommodation and benefit in life? Would a man be deemed to be in the regular exerci&s;e of his intellectual pow|ers, &s;hould he deliberately &s;it &s;till, and wait for &s;ome extraordinary di&s;covery from God, to &s;upply the place of that u&s;e of his own faculties, bodily and mental, in the u&s;e of which only he has rea|&s;on to expect, according to the e&s;tabli&s;ht cour&s;e of providence, that God will furni&s;h him with the good things his convenience or nece&s;&s;ity call for? It would be like folly, only heightened in degree,
<PB N="194" REF="009925_0199_0F7B38864CF8D0E8">
for per&s;ons, in the great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ffairs of &s;alvation and another world, to lay a&s;ide all tho't, care and pains of their own, waiting for God to prevent, &s;uper&s;ede, and ca&s;t contempt upon all human endeavours, by immediately di&s;covering the truth to them, &s;o as that they &s;hall believe it to the &s;aving of their &s;ouls. If God has &s;ometimes, in this way, made &s;uch di&s;coveries to &s;inners, he has herein acted be&s;ide his ordinary method in the kingdom of grace, as really as when, in the kingdom of pro|vidence, he has prevented men's indu&s;try, by interpo&s;ing his own wi&s;dom, without it, in be|&s;towing &s;ignal favors upon them. The go&s;pel-revelation every where proceeds upon this &s;up|po&s;ition. It &s;peaks of God, tis true, while acting in the kingdom of grace, as the "giver of faith"; and it &s;peaks of him al&s;o, while ruling in the kingdom of providence, as the "giver of outward good things". And why may not faith be his gift, as well as temporal pro&s;perity, in concurence with human endeavours, in the u&s;e of properly adapted means? Why may he not, by the inter|vention of men's faculties, &s;uitably employed, be the be&s;tower of &s;piritual, as well as temporal gifts? His agency in &s;piritual matters, tho' different from what it is in temporal ones, and exerted to a quite different purpo&s;e, may yet be adapted to the make and con&s;titution of men, and operate in concurence with their powers and endeavours. And this is the way in which God ordinarily be|&s;tows &s;piritual good things, and faith in par|ticular.</P>
<P>NOT but that he has done a great deal, in order to the be&s;towment of faith, without the
<PB N="195" REF="009925_0200_0F7B3885040AF150">
concurence of men, without the interv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion of human faculties, or endeavours, in any view what|ever. But &s;till, he no more ordinarily BEGINS, than carries on, the work of faith, as it re&s;pects it's exi&s;tence and operation in the hearts of &s;in|ners, without the concuring u&s;e of their powers and endeavours. A particular illu&s;tration of this matter may be of u&s;e. It is certainly of great importance to &s;inners to know, whether they have any thing to do towards the obtainment of faith; and wherein their care and labor may be of &s;er|vice, if they are at all needful.</P>
<P>IT &s;hall be my bui&s;ine&s;s to &s;et this whole affair in a clear and full point of light. In order whereto, I &s;hall be di&s;tinct in &s;hewing, what it is God does, relative to faith, preventive of all human endea|vours; what it is men may and ought to do them&s;elves, in dependence on God; and, finally, that it is ordinarily in concurence with the&s;e en|deavours of their's, that God BEGINS, as well as carries on, the work of faith in them.</P>
<P>AS to the fir&s;t;&mdash;it is readily and thankfully acknowledged, that God, in the riches of his grace, has done &s;ome things in order to faith pre|vious to, and preventive of, all human tho't, or labor in any kind.</P>
<P>THE truth to be believed, or, what means the &s;ame thing, the object of faith, is wholly of God. This can, in no &s;en&s;e, be &s;aid to be owing to, or dependent on, either the will of man, or any thing he was ever able to do. Tis the &s;ole work of God. Of his meer mercy he contrived, and then
<PB N="196" REF="009925_0201_0F7B3885826AD9C8">
revealed the truth to be believed. This he did, in a &s;ummary comprehen&s;ive way, to Adam; to Abraham; to the jewi&s;h nation by Mo&s;es, tho' not plainly, but under various types and figures; afterwards, to this &s;ame people by a &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of prophets, thro' a long &s;eries of time, but &s;till in a manner that left them much in the dark: And, la&s;t of all, by his &s;on Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and his apo&s;tles, who opened his everla&s;ting coun&s;els with reference to our apo&s;tate world, and the wonderful method his infinite wi&s;dom, moved by his boundle&s;s love and compa&s;&s;ion, was plea&s;ed to contrive and execute for the redemp|tion of &s;inners. This, in general, is the truth to be believed; and it is the gift of God, his free gift, preventive of all human tho't.</P>
<P>AND as the truth to be believed, &s;o the evi|dence in proof of its being the truth, is wholly of God. It mu&s;t be &s;o wherein the truth carries with it the &s;ignatures of God, and is evidential of its own divinity; becau&s;e it came &s;olely from him, previous to any &s;kill, or will of man. And it is &s;o al&s;o in regard of its external evidence. It was God that in&s;pired holy men, in old time, to fore|tell the coming of Chri&s;t to be the Savior, and to publi&s;h tho&s;e prophetic marks by which he might be di&s;tingui&s;hed from all pretenders, when he &s;hould come. It was God, dwelling in his &s;on, while he appeared in our fle&s;h, that did tho&s;e miracles, wonders and &s;igns, which gave credit to his character as an approved me&s;&s;enger from hea|ven. And it was God that wro't tho&s;e numerous and diver&s;ified wonderful works, (in the doing whereof the apo&s;tles were only in&s;truments) which
<PB N="197" REF="009925_0202_0F7B3887ADE48518">
are the public, &s;tanding and authentic proof of the divinity of the go&s;pel-doctrine. The&s;e are the te&s;timonies of God; and, by the&s;e, he has witne&s;&s;ed from heaven, that he &s;ent Chri&s;t, and his apo&s;tles; and that the word they preached was the truth. And in thus bearing witne&s;s to the truth, God is every thing, and man nothing. God only is the author of this ground or rea&s;on for faith, preventive of all human &s;kill, contriv|ance, or tho't.</P>
<P>THE &s;pecial part a&s;&s;igned to the holy Gho&s;t, in carrying the redemption by Chri&s;t into effect, is wholly of God likewi&s;e. This divine agent does nothing, in this great affair, but in con&s;e|quence of a con&s;titution, which took ri&s;e from God, without any thing of man. If he di&s;po&s;es and enables the &s;inner to believe the truth as it is in Je&s;us, he does it (whatever is the manner of his operation, which is not the thing we are now con&s;idering) as having been appointed and authori&s;ed hereto. And whatever he does in the kingdom of God, and Chri&s;t, whether in begin|ning, carrying on, or compleating, the work of faith, or any other good work, he does it as the con&s;tituted di&s;pen&s;er of divine grace. And this merciful e&s;tabli&s;hment of God, providing for the &s;inner's being endowed with faith, and every other &s;piritual quality, is intirely of him&s;elf, and was made previous to all &s;kill, will, or even the re|mote&s;t tho't of man. How far the divine Spirit may make u&s;e of human faculties and endeavours, in the execution of his office, will be con&s;idered afterwards; but his being ve&s;ted with his office, and deputed the grand agent in producing faith,
<PB N="198" REF="009925_0203_0F7B388833ADB0C8">
and other graces, in the hearts of the &s;inful &s;ons of Adam, was previous to all human doing, or thinking, with reference hereto. It was the &s;ole contrivance, and con&s;titution of God. There is nothing of man in it, in any view whatever.</P>
<P>THERE are yet other ways, in which God pre|vents men's endeavours, and &s;ometimes even their tho'ts, in order to their obtainment of faith. He has done this by &s;ending "the word of truth", un&s;ought, unlooked for, by them. An ob&s;erva|ble in&s;tance, in this kind, we have in the 16th chap. of the Acts, by con&s;ulting which you will find, that as Paul, with two of his fellow laborers in the Lord, had it in their hearts to preach the go&s;pel to &s;everal places, they imagined they &s;hould go thro' in their travels, they were "forbidden by the holy Gho&s;t", as the words are, in the 6th ver. "The Spirit &s;uffered them not", as it is otherwi&s;e expre&s;&s;ed, ver. 7. And while they were at Troas, Paul, in "a vi&s;ion of the night," &s;ees a man, having the garb and &s;peech of a Ma|cedonian, coming to, and addre&s;&s;ing, him in that affecting language, ver. 9. "come over into Mace|donia, and help us": Upon which it follows, ver. 10. "and after he had &s;een the vi&s;ion, immediately we endeavoured to go into Macedonia; a&s;&s;uredly gathering, that the Lord had called us to preach the go&s;pel to them". It was not therefore owing to any endeavours of the people of Macedonia, that the go&s;pel was bro't to them, but to the di|vine Spirit, directing the&s;e mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t to carry it to them. And in this &s;ame way was the truth made known, in the fir&s;t days of the go&s;pel, to the gentile nations. And this is the meaning,
<PB N="199" REF="009925_0204_0F7B388895236C38">
at lea&s;t in part, of tho&s;e words of I&s;aiah, which the apo&s;tle Paul applies to the&s;e nations, "I was found of them that &s;ought me not, I was made manife&s;t to them that a&s;ked not after me". <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. 10.20.</NOTE> And in tho&s;e places, where the go&s;pel has for many years been preached, and where there are great numbers of believers in Chri&s;t, as the Jews are in Mo&s;es, and the Turks in Mahomet, that is, by education &amp; cu&s;tom, and in this &s;en&s;e only, the fir&s;t thing giving ri&s;e to the obtainment of "like previous faith" with the primitive chri&s;tians, as to one and another of them, has &s;ometimes been preventive of all endeavours of their's. Some awakening providence has rou&s;ed their attention; or, without any fore&s;ight of their own, they have been in the way of &s;ome word of truth, &s;o adapted to their ca&s;e, and &s;o ob&s;ervably pointing out their character, and danger, that it has, under the di|vine influence, impre&s;&s;ed their hearts, and given &s;uch a turn to their tho'ts and pur&s;uits, as has ended in the &s;alvation of their &s;ouls. And there are few, perhaps, in chri&s;tian countries, e&s;pecially among tho&s;e who have for any time, after their arrival at maturity of years, "walkt in the way of their heart, and in the &s;ight of their eyes", but mu&s;t a&s;cribe their obtainment of faith, if they really po&s;&s;e&s;s it, to &s;omething or other in the pro|vidence, or word, of God, that fir&s;t awakened their con&s;ideration, and this without any previous foretho't, or endeavours of their own.</P>
<P>IN the&s;e and &s;uch like &s;en&s;es, God is before|hand with &s;inners. The truth to be believed is certainly provided by him, without all care or

tho't of their's; and &s;o is the &s;eal he has &s;et to it as his truth; and the agency likewi&s;e of the di|vine Spirit to give it an enlivened and efficacious virtue: Nor will it be denied, that he &s;ends the go&s;pel, where it is not, commonly un&s;ought for; or that he often prevents the &s;inners who already enjoy it, by &s;ome providential &s;troke, or word of truth, by which they are &s;et a thinking in good earne&s;t. But &s;till, the endeavours of &s;inners, in &s;ubordination to the agency of the divine Spirit, are far from being &s;uper&s;eded. Notwith&s;tanding all that God does without them, they will be al|together inexcu&s;able, if they &s;it idle as tho' they had nothing to do them&s;elves, and all doings of their's would be u&s;ele&s;s and vain.

<P>THE fir&s;t is; when I &s;ay, the &s;inner may do &s;ome things towards the obtainment of faith, I don't mean, that the things which he may do are acts or in&s;tances of the faith he is &s;eeking, not being as yet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it.

If therefore the &s;inner can do any thing in order to faith, what he does mu&s;t be con&s;idered as proceding, not from the faith he is endeavouring to obtain, but from &s;ome other principle of action. While men are de&s;titute of faith, tis a contradiction to &s;ay, that they can ei|ther think, &s;peak, or do any thing, as taking ri&s;e from this &s;pring of operation.

in it&s;elf a nullity; as truly &s;o as it would be to direct a blind man, or a deaf man, to perform &s;ome action that &s;uppo&s;ed the faculties of &s;eeing, or hearing, in order to their being endowed with them. The direction, in both the&s;e ca&s;es, would be equally de&s;tructive of it&s;elf. It could mean nothing, unle&s;s to in&s;ult tho&s;e to whom it was given.</P>
<P>I AM therefore free to own, that the endeavours of &s;inners, in order to &s;aving faith, are not to be looked upon as acts of that faith they are at pre|&s;ent de&s;titute of; nay, I am ready to allow, that none of their tho'ts, no motions of their hearts, no workings of their affections, no exertments of them&s;elves in wi&s;hes, or de&s;ires, ought to be con|&s;idered as exerci&s;es of this faith; but &s;o far as they may have experience of them, they are the effects of &s;ome other principles they are endowed with. If any popular preachers, or others of more &s;olid judgment, have expre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves &s;o as to lead one to think, it was their de&s;ign to put men up|on endeavours that &s;uppo&s;e faith, in order to their being endowed with it, they are, without all doubt, chargeable with great incon&s;i&s;tency: Tho' I would not charge them with the percep|tion of it; much le&s;s would I take occa&s;ion, from their being unwarily incon&s;i&s;tent with them&s;elves, to &s;peak of them as deceivers that are going them|&s;elves, and leading others, to the place of endle&s;s de&s;truction.</P>
<P>ANOTHER thing I de&s;ire may be previou&s;ly taken notice of is, that &s;inners, tho' de&s;titute of the faith that is ju&s;tifying, have yet other prin|ciples

in their nature, that are capable of giving ri&s;e to a great variety of actions, both inward and outward; and this, as it re&s;pects religion, and the &s;alvation of their &s;ouls. As intelligent moral beings, they are endowed not only with percep|tive powers, rendering them capable of admiting ideas into their minds, the original materials <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> all knowledge; they are endowed not only with the faculty of retaining the&s;e ideas there, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> tending to them, of comparing them one with another, of judging of their agreement or di&s;a|greement, and, in the&s;e ways, of di&s;covering a great variety of intere&s;ting truths: I &s;ay, not only are they endowed with the&s;e capacities, but with li|berty of choice, and a power, in con&s;equence hereof, of acting this way or that, without hind|rance or re&s;traint. Be&s;ides all which, a variety of different pa&s;&s;ions and affections are planted in their nature, rendering them capable of various and different emotions, both agreable and di&s;|agreable, and of being rou&s;ed, in con&s;equence of them, to determinations and pur&s;uits, as various and different, as the feelings in their minds that are the occa&s;ion of them. Nor has &s;in de&s;troyed any of the&s;e powers of human nature; tho' it has greatly di&s;turbed the regularity of their operati|ons. Sinners, notwith&s;tanding all their depravity and guilt, are &s;till capable of thinking, rea&s;oning, con&s;idering, reflecting; they are &s;till capable of chu&s;ing &s;ome things in preference to others, and of ordering their conduct conformably to &s;uch choice; they are &s;till &s;u&s;ceptible of all the emo|tions that are &s;ignified by love or hatred, joy or grief, hope or fear, or any other pa&s;&s;ion or af|fection; and of being variou&s;ly excited to action,

by means of them. A large fund, you &s;ee, is here opened for human endeavours, from other prin|ciples be&s;ides that of faith which is ju&s;tifying; and con&s;equently that &s;inners, who have not this faith, and can do nothing, not &s;o much as exert one wi&s;h, or tho't, from this principle, may yet do a great deal from other principles planted in their nature. And the&s;e are the doings that are meant by tho&s;e that are precedaneous to ju&s;tifying faith, and &s;poken of as performed in order to the obtainment of it.</P>
<P>THERE is yet another thing, I would de&s;ire might be previou&s;ly remembred, and this is, that, when I &s;peak of what &s;inners may do, in order to the obtainment of the faith that ju&s;tifies, I would not be under&s;tood to mean, much le&s;s to &s;ugge&s;t, as tho' they could do any thing, relative to this affair, without God. For as they derived all their powers of operation from him, &s;o are they ab&s;olutely dependant on him, not only for the continuance, but exerci&s;e, of them. "In him they live and move", as it was from him that they received their beings. Tis by his influence, &s;u&s;taining their powers, and concuring with them, that they are enabled both to think, will, &s;peak, and do: Nor without this influence could they exert any power, either of their &s;ouls, or bodies. But be&s;ides this general influence of the fir&s;t cau&s;e on all the doings of men, there is another &s;ort of influence of a &s;upe|rior kind, a &s;piritual one, that is afforded even to &s;inners, while in an unju&s;tified &s;tate, in relation to the affairs of religion and &s;alvation. It will not, I &s;uppo&s;e, be denied by any, who profe&s;s a regard to the &s;acred writings, that tho&s;e who will

finally peri&s;h may yet be favored with the common illuminations, and ordinary a&s;&s;i&s;tances, of the &s;pirit of grace. God &s;trove more than a hun|dred years by his Spirit with the old world; tho' he afterwards de&s;troyed them for corrupting them&s;elves, in oppo&s;ition to the &s;trivings of his Spirit with them. And there are thou&s;ands in the chri&s;tian world, who will be "hurt of the &s;econd death", notwith&s;tanding the &s;trivings of God's Spirit with them, in con&s;equence of which they may have been under convictions, awaken|ings, enlightnings, and perhaps imagined joys of the holy Gho&s;t. There is certainly a common influence of the Spirit of God, which &s;inners may be the &s;ubjects of, while de&s;titute of the faith that is &s;aving. Whenever therefore I &s;peak of what &s;inners may do in order to this faith, I would be under&s;tood to mean, not what they may do, in their own &s;trength, under the general concurence of God with their natural powers; but what they may do with the concuring influence of the Spirit of grace, which may be, and actually is, afforded to them. The&s;e are the doings I intend. Ac|cordingly, way being made herefor, I go on to declare what the&s;e doings are: Nor &s;hall I think it impertinent, if I am a little particular in point|ing them out. Let it then be &s;aid,</P>
<P>THEY may, by exerting their powers of rea&s;on and under&s;tanding, under the advantages they are favored with, be &s;o far per&s;uaded of the ex|i&s;tence and perfections of God, as to be left in|excu&s;eable if they don't do honor to him. Thus much we are taught by an in&s;pired apo&s;tle, who &s;ays, "that the invi&s;ible things of God, from the creation of the world, are clearly &s;een, being un|der&s;tood

<P>THEY may likewi&s;e &s;o employ their natural faculties as to di&s;cern a difference between moral good and evil; or, what means the &s;ame thing, be|tween virtue and vice, between what is commanded and what is forbidden by the natural law of God. This, the &s;ame divine writer very evidently inti|mates, when he &s;peaks of the Gentiles, "who have not the revealed law of God", as "doing by nature the things contained in this law", and as being "a law to them&s;elves", tho' they "have not this writ|ten law". <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. 2.14.</NOTE></P>
<P>AND as they may, by the exerci&s;e of their intel|lectual powers, perceive a real difference in the nature of actions as virtuous or vicious, &s;o may they, in like manner, become convinced in their con&s;ci|ences of the obligations they are under to chu&s;e and pur&s;ue the former, rather than the latter; and be bro't to view them&s;elves as liable to the righteous re&s;entments of God, wherein they fail of doing &s;o. To this purpo&s;e are tho&s;e words, in the epi&s;tle to the Romans, in which the apo&s;tle Paul, &s;peaking of the Gentiles, and their gro&s;s immoralities, in vio|lation of the law of nature, &s;ays, "they do them" them&s;elves, and take plea&s;ure in them that do them", while, at the &s;ame time, "they know the judgment of God, and that they that commit &s;uch things are worthy of death". <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Rom. 1.32.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="009925_0212_0F7B38924FE7A3D8">THEY may al&s;o, by u&s;ing their implanted powers, be led into a per&s;ua&s;ion of the immortality of their &s;ouls, a future &s;tate of retribution, and their ob|noxiou&s;ne&s;s to puni&s;hment in that &s;tate, having been &s;inners again&s;t the "law of their minds", which is the law of God; yea, in con&s;equence of this per|&s;ua&s;ion, they may, being moved with fear, earne&s;tly inquire, what they &s;hall do to e&s;cape this wrath of God, they are &s;en&s;ible they are expo&s;ed to? This is evident from the fore-bodings of vengeance in the con&s;ciences of many among the heathen, and the various methods they have taken to appea&s;e their gods, and avoid their angry re&s;entments.</P>
<P>AND as they may, by care, in the exerci&s;e of their rea&s;on, under the common ble&s;&s;ing of God, be per|&s;uaded of the truth of natural religion, &s;o may they, by like care, in the u&s;e of the &s;ame faculty, under the ordinary influence of heaven, become believers in revelation; what I here mean is, &s;uch believers as multitudes were, in the days of Mo&s;es and the prophets, of Je&s;us Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles; who, tho' they were really believers, and did a great deal from the faith they were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, were yet de&s;titute of that faith which is unto life. The evidences in proof of revelation lie open to in|quiry by all, who are favored with the knowledge of them. And &s;inners, who are thus favored, may, if they plea&s;e, attend to them, and examine them with a becoming care and diligence. And they will be under great advantage thus to do, if they have had excited in them a &s;en&s;e of guilt and danger, by the truths of natural religion. Their minds will now be prepared to take the&s;e proofs into their &s;erious con&s;ideration, and to deliberate upon them as mat|ters

in which they are nearly and awfully concern|ed. And if they thus attend to, and examine them, they may, under the illuminating influences of the Spirit that are common, become po&s;&s;e&s;t of a real faith in revelation, if it &s;hould not be the faith that is &s;aving; and it may di&s;cover its real being in them, by the influence it has upon them.

<P>They may, in con&s;equence of this faith, e&s;peci|ally in this awakened &s;tate of mind, heartily grieve for their pa&s;t commi&s;&s;ions of &s;in, and carefully en|deavour to be no more chargeable with &s;uch com|mi&s;&s;ions for the future.

<P>THEY may (to come to in&s;tances here) engage in the duty of reading God's word; and they may perform it daily, and with &s;uch care, diligence and attention, as to become po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a clear doctrinal knowledge of its truths; yea, they may attain to &s;uch a knowledge of the&s;e truths, as to have excited in them an earne&s;t &s;ollicitude to be formed by them, under the enlightening influen|ces of the good Spirit, to a meetne&s;s for the in|heritance of the &s;anctified by faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>

<P>THEY may, in &s;pecial, be much in prayer to the God and father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the father of mercies, and God of all grace; and they may pray to him, really believing that he may, thro' Chri&s;t, &s;hew favor to &s;uch &s;inners as they are, however unworthy of his notice, how|ever de&s;erving of his righteous di&s;plea&s;ure.

And, as the divine Spirit is the great agent in preparing &s;inners for the redemption by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, they may be humbly urgent in their application to the throne of mercy for the holy Gho&s;t, to give them that view of the truth in its divinity and glory, with|out which they will never be the &s;ubjects of the faith which is "unto life". And they may pray for this enlightening influence of the Spirit, as being deeply &s;en&s;ible of the need they &s;tand in of it, and that without it they &s;hall not &s;ee the truth &s;o as to believe it to &s;alvation.</P>
<P>THUS &s;inners, tho' de&s;titute, as yet, of &s;aving faith, may do a great many things in religion, from other, and lower principles.

<P>AND need I now &s;ay, that &s;inners ought to do the&s;e things? Their obligation is in&s;eperably connected with their capacity, and all along keeps pace with it. If they are capable of doing, they are bound to do, and in every in&s;tance to which their capacity extends. And herein indeed will lie their guilt, and the aggravation of it, if they continue in unbelief; not that they did not, by their own power, work faith in them&s;elves; but that they did not do what they might have done, were endowed with a capacity, and placed under advantages, to do. And in this view of their ca&s;e, they will be left without all excu&s;e.

<P>TIS true, they can neither ab&s;tain from &s;in, nor practi&s;e duty, from a principle of &s;aving faith, not being endowed with it; but, as they can do both, from other principles, tho' of an inferior kind, &s;hall they not do what they can do?

They are "rea&s;onable creatures", if they an't "true believers".

<P>IN the la&s;t place, that tis "ordinarily" in con|curence with "the&s;e endeavours" of &s;inners, that God be&s;tows his Spirit to "begin", as well as carry on, the work of faith in their hearts. He does not exert his influence to this &s;aving pur|po&s;e, &s;o as to &s;uper&s;ede, or &s;et a&s;ide, all previ|ous preparation, in the u&s;e of means and endea|vours. If he has done thus in here and there a &s;ingle in&s;tance, &s;uch rare ca&s;es ought not to be made the &s;tandard of his conduct in this matter. Tis not the way in which he "ordinarily" pro|ceeds.</P>
<P>AND for the proof of this, I may appeal to the experience of tho&s;e, who have "obtained like precious faith" with the primitive di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t, and are clearly &s;atisfied of it by its having formed them into new men, and di&s;po&s;ed and enabled them to all chri&s;tian labors of love, and works of piety and righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>SOME of you, it may be, were going on in a cour&s;e of &s;in, tho'tle&s;s of God, and unconcerned about the great affairs of religion and another

world, when, by &s;ome awakening providence, or &s;ea&s;onable word of truth, you were rou&s;ed to &s;eri|ous &s;elf-reflection. But, after this, and before you had rea&s;on to account your&s;elves believers unto life, were you not &s;orely pre&s;&s;ed in your minds, from a &s;en&s;e of &s;in and guilt? Were you not herefrom con&s;trained to come to a &s;top in this or the other vicious cour&s;e? Were you not ex|cited to take up the practice of this and that neg|lected duty? Could you be ea&s;y without &s;earch|ing the &s;criptures, in which you might find the words of eternal life? Could you let &s;lip favor|able opportunities for prayer to the God, who &s;eeth in &s;ecret? Could you avoid being pre&s;ent at tho&s;e places, where you might be in&s;tructed in the things pertaining to the kingdom of God, and of Chri&s;t?&mdash;And are you not able to &s;ay, at &s;uch or &s;uch a time, while con&s;ulting the &s;acred books of revelation, or pouring out your &s;ouls in fervent prayer to the God of all grace, or employ|ing your minds in meditation on the invi&s;ible ob|jects of the eternal world, or giving your earne&s;t attention to &s;ome &s;uitable truths bro't to you in the di&s;pen&s;ation of the word, you had &s;uch a view of God, of Chri&s;t, of your&s;elves; you had &s;uch a &s;ight of the divinity, the glory and importance of revealed truths, as leads you to think the work of faith was then wro't in you with power? E&s;pe|cially, as, from this time, you have been enabled to walk, in &s;ome good mea&s;ure, "worthy of the Lord Je&s;us unto all plea&s;ing", and of the God and father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who has thus called you into his kingdom.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="009925_0223_0F7B389A9B601A38">IT may be, as to others of you, the &s;ame work has been wro't in you, tho' not in the &s;ame per|ceptible way. You have been concerned about your &s;ouls, and their eternal well-being; you have &s;een your&s;elves to be &s;inners, and, as &s;uch, liable to divine wrath; you have &s;een that there is no help for you, but by grace thro' Chri&s;t; you have &s;ought the favor of God, thro' him who has been the "propitiation for &s;in", and have often done it, and with fervency and importunity; you have waited upon God in the u&s;e of all appointed means, and have waited upon him &s;eriou&s;ly and earne&s;tly; wi&s;hing and hoping for a ble&s;&s;ing: And you are at length able to &s;ay, one and ano|ther of you, "whereas I was once blind, I now &s;ee". The truths of revelation have appeared to me in &s;uch a light, have &s;o moved my heart, have &s;o influenced my con&s;cience, have &s;o bowed my will, have &s;o turned the current of my affections, and have become &s;uch a &s;pring of action in me, in conformity to the revealed rule of duty, that I can't but hope I am po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which will finally i&s;&s;ue in "&s;alvation with eternal glory".</P>
<P>I DOUBT not, I have here de&s;cribed "the way", in which &s;ome of you that hear me, &amp; many others, have, under the agency of the divine Spirit, been bro't into the life of God, and a &s;tate of accept|ance with him thro' Je&s;us the Savior. And tis the "common way" in which the work of God is begun in tho&s;e, who effectually believe; unle&s;s we &s;hould except &s;ome, who might have been &s;avingly taught of God &s;o early in life, that they know not how they became the &s;ubjects of "un|feigned

faith"; tho' they are well a&s;&s;ured it real|ly "dwells in them".</P>
<P>AND the &s;cripture accords with experience in pointing this out, as the "ordinary way" of the Spirit, in making men partakers of the grace of God in truth.</P>
<P>THE Elias, who&s;e coming was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cede the coming of the Me&s;&s;iah, is &s;poken of by the pro|phet Malachi, in tho&s;e words, "behold, I will &s;end my me&s;&s;enger, and he &s;hall prepare the way before me".<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mal. 3.1.</NOTE> John Bapti&s;t was "this Elias which was to come". <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Matth. 11.14.</NOTE> And our Savior, &s;peaking of him, calls him "a prophet, and more than a pro|phet"; adding this as the rea&s;on of &s;o honorable a te&s;timony concerning him, "for this is he of whom it is written, behold, I &s;end my me&s;&s;enger before my face, which &s;hall prepare thy way be|fore thee". <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Matth. 11.9, 10.</NOTE> The language here u&s;ed evidently alludes to Harbingers, and &s;uch other Me&s;&s;engers, as were employed, upon the journeyings of prin|ces, to take care to level the ways, and remove all ob&s;tructions that might incommode their pa&s;&s;ing along, or render it le&s;s convenient. In analogy herewith, John's bui&s;ine&s;s, as the Me&s;&s;iah's harbinger, was, not only to give notice of his ap|proaching advent, but to prepare the way for it by removing ob&s;tacles, and begeting in &s;inners a di&s;po&s;ition &s;uited to the de&s;ign of it, and that might tend to put them in a readine&s;s to hearken to his doctrine. And this he did, at lea&s;t in part, by rou&s;ing them to a &s;en&s;e of danger, that, being "moved with fear", they might endeavour to
<PB N="220" REF="009925_0225_0F7B389C0C94EE98">
avoid it. That was the &s;pirit of his preaching, at lea&s;t to &s;ome of his hearers, "who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Bring forth fruits meet for repentance.&mdash;The ax is laid to the root of the trees; therefore every tree, which bringeth not forth good fruit, is hewn down and ca&s;t into the fire. I indeed bapti&s;e you with water unto repentance; but he that cometh after me is mightier than I,&mdash;who&s;e fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into his garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire". <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. 3.7,&mdash;12.</NOTE> But, if all previous preparation was u&s;ele&s;s, why was John &s;ent to make it? If it were to no purpo&s;e, that &s;inners &s;hould feel their expo&s;edne&s;s to wrath, or endeavour to e&s;cape it, why was he &s;o earne&s;t in addre&s;&s;ing to their fears, and warning them to flee from it? If it were as likely they &s;hould ob|tain faith in Chri&s;t, without perceiving the mi&s;ery of their pre&s;ent condition, as by being in an a|wakened &s;tate of mind, di&s;covering to them their ab&s;olute need of a Savior, why all this expence of labor to excite in their minds a &s;en&s;e of &s;in and guilt? It mu&s;t &s;urely be of &s;ome &s;ervice, in order to faith in Chri&s;t, to have produced in us &s;uch a perception of our peri&s;hing circum&s;tances, as may di&s;po&s;e us to look out for help: Otherwi&s;e, it will be difficult to point out the &s;pecial pertinency of John's office, as God's me&s;&s;enger, "to prepare the way" for a reception of Chri&s;t as the Savior of &s;inners.</P>
<P>AND our Savior him&s;elf both began, and carri|ed on, his public mini&s;try, by u&s;ing "means" to
<PB N="221" REF="009925_0226_0F7B389CDAC94CC0">
prepare his hearers for, and per&s;uade them to, a cordial reception of "the truth". Tis according|ly ob&s;ervable, he did not think it enough "bare|ly to preach the go&s;pel", but called upon men to "believe it"; at the &s;ame time, exhibiting to their view "&s;uch evidence" of the divinity of his mi&s;&s;ion, and the truth of what he taught, as was naturally and powerfully adapted to awaken their attention, and di&s;po&s;e and engage them to give credit to the me&s;&s;ages he delivered to them. No one can rea&s;onably doubt of this, who has ever been at the pains to read the writings of the Evan|geli&s;ts. We are there told of the numerous mira|cles, which our Lord wro't upon the &s;ick, the lame, the dumb, the blind, the deaf, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the devil, yea, upon the dead in rai&s;ing them to life; and that he performed the&s;e miraculous works, that men might believe in him as the Me&s;&s;iah, the promi&s;ed Savior. But what occa&s;ion was there for the&s;e exertments of almighty power, if no means were to be u&s;ed with men in order to faith? Or if their attending to them was neither their duty, nor "the way", in which they might expect to be wro't upon to believe? Our Savior certainly had it in view, by "the miracles, won|ders and &s;igns, which he did in the mid&s;t of the Jews, to approve him&s;elf a man of God among them". And, if he did the&s;e works of wonder to give credit to his character as one &s;ent of God, it would be highly reproachful to him, either not to look upon them as a well-fited means to an&s;wer this end, or not to e&s;teem it the duty of tho&s;e, who were favor'd with them, to pay a due regard to them; endeavouring, in "this way", to be|come convinced of the truth of his preten&s;ions
<PB N="222" REF="009925_0227_0F7B389D87E2EFA8">
and doctrine. Had our Lord "barely declared the truth, leaving it wholly with God to make converts", it might have been tho't, that men had nothing to do but wait for the exertment of his power to work faith in them. But his conduct was quite the rever&s;e of this. Be&s;ides "declar|ing the truth", he offered &s;uch evidence to con|vince his hearers, that it was the truth, as left them not only inexcu&s;able, but expo&s;ed to a heavier damnation than other men, if they would not at|tend to it, that they might be convinced by it. So he told the people of Capernaum, who con|tinued in unbelief, notwith&s;tanding "the mighty works he had done among them" Says he, to them, "it &s;hall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom, in the day of judgment, than for you". <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. 11.24.</NOTE> With what pertinency, I may rather &s;ay, with what ju&s;tice, could our Lord thus addre&s;s to the&s;e people, if, after he had done &s;o many wondrous works among them, to engage their attention, and per&s;uade them to believe in him, it was not their duty to exert either their wills, under&s;tand|ings, or any power either of their &s;ouls or bodies, in order to faith? If it lay wholly with God, without the&s;e means, or any other, or any endea|vours of their's, to be&s;tow it on them? Was it true, that their u&s;ing care and diligence in &s;eri|ou&s;ly and thoroughly examining into the force of the&s;e proofs of our Lord's character, with earne&s;t prayer to the God of all grace that they might be led into a right judgment upon them, was not "the way" to obtain faith, any more than if they &s;at &s;till and did nothing, why are they blamed for their unbelief? What &s;hould make it a dam|ning
<PB N="223" REF="009925_0228_0F7B389E4D925D80">
&s;in in them? The&s;e are difficult que&s;tions, and, as I imagine, impo&s;&s;ible to be an&s;wered upon the impleaded &s;uppo&s;ition. The plain truth is, to &s;ay, that human endeavours, in the u&s;e of means, is not "the way", under the Spirit's in|fluence, in order to faith, is virtually, and in re|ality of &s;en&s;e, to &s;ay, that our Savior needle&s;ly u&s;ed means with men that they might become believ|ers; that they will not be blame-worthy, &s;hould they &s;tupidly neglect to give the&s;e means a &s;eri|ous con&s;ideration; and that they de&s;erve no puni&s;hment, much le&s;s an aggravated one, for any folly, or &s;in, they are hereby chargeable with. I &s;ee not, but the&s;e con&s;equences are &s;trictly ju&s;t; and that even the Scribes and Phari&s;ees of old mu&s;t &s;tand ju&s;tified in all their perver&s;e &s;tubborn|ne&s;s, in oppo&s;ition to Chri&s;t and his go&s;pel, if the "only way" to faith is to wait, without any en|deavours, in the u&s;e of any means, till we are made the &s;ubjects of it. The whole mini&s;try of our Savior certainly proceded upon the contrary &s;uppo&s;ition, that <HI>means</HI> are to be u&s;ed with men in order to faith, that men mu&s;t them&s;elves give "due attention" to the&s;e means, and that this is "the ordinary way", and the only one, in which they may rea&s;onably hope to become believers in chri&s;tianity, to the &s;aving of their &s;ouls.</P>
<P>AND the apo&s;tles contented them&s;elves, no more than their ma&s;ter and Lord, with laying before men the &s;imple truth of the go&s;pel", as "the only way" to faith. Be&s;ides "preaching the truth", they endeavoured to do that al&s;o which might have a natural aptitude, a rational tendency, under the divine ble&s;&s;ing, to beget faith in their
<PB N="224" REF="009925_0229_0F7B389F4E1D3860">
hearers. When the apo&s;tle Paul went into a &s;ynagogue at The&s;&s;alonica to preach to the Jews, he not only declared <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts 17.3.</NOTE> "that Je&s;us was the Chri&s;t", that he "had &s;uffered", and "ro&s;e again from the dead"; but "rea&s;oned with them out of the &s;criptures" upon the&s;e heads: "Opening", as well as "alledging, that Je&s;us was the Chri&s;t, and that he mu&s;t needs have &s;uffered, and ro&s;e again from the dead". <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> And this was "his manner", the method he u&s;ually took. And &s;urely, he hereby meant to u&s;e a proper and well &s;uited means to convince their under&s;tandings, and per|&s;uade them to believe the truth. But if it did not lie with them to attend to his rea&s;oning, and con&s;ider his arguments; or, if their doing this, in the be&s;t manner they could, had no tendency towards their becoming believers in Chri&s;t, he mo&s;t certainly took a great deal of pains for nothing. This conduct of this apo&s;tle very evidently &s;hows, that rea&s;oning with unbelievers is not only a pro|per, but the true "&s;cripture-way", in order to their having faith. And if &s;o, that con&s;ideration, attention, and a readine&s;s to receive conviction upon good evidence, are &s;uitable and fit, and in|deed "the way" in which the divine ble&s;&s;ing may be expected: Otherwi&s;e, 'twill be hard to account for this behavior of the apo&s;tle Paul.</P>
<P>And Philip, upon his being driven away from Jeru&s;alem, by rea&s;on of the per&s;ecution that had been rai&s;ed again&s;t the church there, not only "preached Chri&s;t" to the city of Samaria; <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts 8.5.</NOTE> but "ca&s;t out unclean &s;pirits out of many that were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with them, and healed many that had
<PB N="225" REF="009925_0230_0F7B389FDAA59820">
been taken with pal&s;ies, and were lame". <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ver. 7.</NOTE> And tis ob&s;erved, by the &s;acred hi&s;torian, "that the people, with one accord, gave heed to tho&s;e things which Philip &s;pake, <HI>hearing and &s;eeing the miracles which he did</HI>". <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 6.</NOTE> If the&s;e miracles had no rational tendency, no moral aptitude, to awaken the con|&s;ideration of the&s;e Samaritans, and di&s;po&s;e them, with greater readine&s;s, to hearken to what he &s;aid to them, why did he work them? And why is their attention attributed, under God, to their "&s;eeing and hearing them"? He certainly did more than "declare the &s;imple truth". And what he did was evidently de&s;igned, by God, to prepare their minds for the reception of the truth; which was altogether needle&s;s, if no previous pre|paration was in the lea&s;t u&s;eful, and it might as well have been expected, God &s;hould have given them faith without, as with it.</P>
<P>IN agreement with this conduct of Philip, tis ob&s;ervable, after the apo&s;tles had been com|mi&s;&s;ioned to "go into all the world, and preach the go&s;pel", that is, declare the &s;imple &s;aving truth, they received expre&s;s orders from Chri&s;t him&s;elf "to tarry at Jeru&s;alem until they were endued with power from on high",<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Luk 24.49.</NOTE> that is, with power from heaven to work miracles. They ac|cordingly tarried in the city of Jeru&s;alem; and, "on the day of Penteco&s;t", they were endued with this power: For they were "filled with the ho|ly Gho&s;t", and, in con&s;equence hereof, "began to &s;peak with other tongues", &s;o as that "devout men out of every nation under heaven heard them &s;peak every man in his own language". <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Acts 2.4, 5,6.</NOTE> And
<PB N="226" REF="009925_0231_0F7B38A08DBA09C0">
what was the effect? The minds of many were awakened to attention, and in "this way" pre|pared to hearken to what they had to &s;ay. Upon which, the apo&s;tle Peter preached a long &s;ermon to them, wherein he not only declared, that "that &s;ame Je&s;us whom they had crucified, was the Chri&s;t"; but endeavoured, by clear and &s;trong rea&s;oning, both from "prophe&s;ie" and "miri|cles", to make it beyond di&s;pute evident, that he really was &s;o; as may be &s;een at large in the &s;e|cond chapter of the Acts. More was here done than laying before the hearers "the &s;aving truth". Proper care was taken, and &s;uitable means u&s;ed, both to rou&s;e their attention, and &s;et the evidence of our Lord's character in a clear and convincing point of light. The apo&s;tles had it in their view to make believers of the&s;e Jews. And "the way" they took, in order to it, was not meerly to tell them, that "Je&s;us was the Me&s;&s;iah"; but to ex|hibit al&s;o &s;uch evidence in proof of it, as was wi&s;ely and powerfully adapted to produce in their minds a conviction of this truth. And it appears, from what follows, that they took the right method. For, upon their giving &s;uch undenia|ble proof, "that Je&s;us was both Chri&s;t &amp; Lord", great numbers were &s;o "pricked in their hearts", as to be put upon inquiring, with &s;ober &s;eriou&s;|ne&s;s, "what &s;hall we do"?</P>
<P>IT may be worth remarking here, tho' the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;tate of mind the&s;e hearers of Peter were now in, &s;ignified by their being "pricked in their hearts", was owing to the credit they gave to the "truth," as preached by this apo&s;tle, and confirmed with irrefragable evidence; yet no one
<PB N="227" REF="009925_0232_0F7B38A14DE38EA8">
knows, or is capable of knowing, that their faith <HI>now</HI> was of the ju&s;tifying kind. Tis true, "three thou&s;and" of the&s;e heare<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, upon being "added to the church, continued &s;tedfa&s;tly in the apo&s;tle's doctrine and fellow&s;hip, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers".<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts 2.41, 42.</NOTE> But this they might do, col|lectively con&s;idered; while yet, &s;peaking of each one individually, they might not. Or, &s;hould it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that every individual, con&s;tituting this collective body, "continued &s;tedfa&s;t", tis far from being certain, or indeed &s;o much as proba|ble, that their faith, when fir&s;t b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o't under di&s;|tre&s;s, was of the &s;aving kind. It might, under the influence of the Spirit, if not different from their's who peri&s;h, be productive of this convicti|on; they might al&s;o, in virtue of it, be "added to the church", and "have fellow&s;hip with the apo&s;tles in breaking of bread, and in prayers"; and further &s;till, this faith of their's, tho' &s;hort, at pre&s;ent, of that which is &s;aving, might after|wards, under the &s;pecial illuminations of the Spirit, in their u&s;e of the in&s;titutions of chri&s;tianity, be|come that "faith by which the ju&s;t do live", and are "continued &s;tedfa&s;t". And this, perhaps, was no uncommon ca&s;e in tho&s;e primitive times; nor has it been in other ages &s;ince. Upon which, it is natural to ob&s;erve the propriety of their join|ing in an attendance on the in&s;titutions of the chri&s;tian religion, who have &s;o much faith in its divine origin, as to be herefrom pierced in their minds from a &s;en&s;e of &s;in and guilt, and put upon inquiring, "what &s;hall we do"? They &s;hould, in conformity to the pattern here &s;et us by the apo|&s;tle, be directed to be "bapti&s;ed in the name of
<PB N="228" REF="009925_0233_0F7B38A205F4BC08">
Je&s;us Chri&s;t", if they have not been bapti&s;ed al|ready; and al&s;o to join in fellow&s;hip with chri|&s;tians "in breaking of bread, and in prayers", and in an attendance on all the duties of piety. If their faith is not as yet &s;aving, this is a proper means in order to its becoming &s;o, and, as I ima|gine, the be&s;t they can be advi&s;ed to.</P>
<P>I SHALL not think it a needle&s;s going out of my way, to take &s;ome notice here, be|fore I proceed, of the compa&s;&s;ion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t towards tho&s;e, who had &s;o much faith in natural, or revealed religion, or both, as to be in di&s;tre&s;s of &s;oul from a &s;en&s;e of &s;in and guilt. Do we ever find him telling this kind of per&s;ons, their anxiety was needle&s;s? There was no need of any &s;uch &s;ollicitude&mdash;It an&s;wered no purpo&s;e&mdash;They might as well be without it&mdash;There was no difference be|tween them, and the mo&s;t carele&s;s and &s;ecure &s;in|ners on this &s;ide hell, as to the likelihood of their finding the &s;aving truth. Far from giving any &s;uch in&s;inuations, he always treated them with &s;ingular tenderne&s;s; directing them, in the mo&s;t endearing manner, to the only way in which they could find relief.</P>
<P>TIS accordingly ob&s;ervable, tho&s;e who "labor, and are heavy-laden", are particularly told, by the merciful Je&s;us, where to go that they may "find re&s;t".<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. 11.28.</NOTE> It would give but a poor jejune &s;en&s;e to his words, &s;hould we explain them meerly, or on|ly, of a "re&s;t" by the go&s;pel from tho&s;e ceremo|nious rites, which were "a yoke" that neither the then Jews, nor their fathers, "were able to

bear". Tis more honorable to our Savior to &s;uppo&s;e, he is here principally &s;peaking of tho&s;e, who labor'd under a &s;en&s;e of guilt, &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of it as filled their minds with fears that were grievou&s;ly burden&s;ome. Sinners therefore, that have "only &s;o much faith" as to be awaken'd to &s;ee, and feel, the greatne&s;s of their guilt and dan|ger, are here called upon, as it were by name, to repair to Chri&s;t, in whom they may find ea&s;e, by being freed from their guilt, and put into a &s;tate of &s;afety re&s;pecting another world. And tis &s;ure|ly an advantage to be in this &s;tate of mind, ra|ther than in a &s;tupid and in&s;en&s;ible one, if tho&s;e, who have been bro't into it, are particularly taken notice of by the Savior of men, and invited to "go to him" that they may find re&s;t unto their &s;ouls".</P>
<P>THIS &s;ame kind of &s;inners, pointed out by ano|ther metaphor, are, in like manner, mercifully directed, by Chri&s;t him&s;elf, to go to him for the &s;upply of their &s;piritual wants. "In the la&s;t day, the great day of the fea&s;t, Je&s;us &s;tood and cried, &s;aying, If any man thir&s;t, let him come to me and drink". <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Joh. 7.37.</NOTE> "If any man thir&s;t". The per|&s;ons here de&s;cribed are tho&s;e, who are in pain and di&s;tre&s;s, thro' anxious tho'ts and cares about their condition in the future world. The de&s;cription is certainly applicable to &s;uch. Where there is the want of ju&s;tifying faith, there may be a "thir&s;t", and a very &s;evere one too; that is, an unea&s;y di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;tate of mind, re&s;embling that of the body when a man craves drink, and is greatly pained for want of it. And this kind of
<PB N="230" REF="009925_0235_0F7B38A381443FD0">
thir&s;t is more proper to &s;inners who are not be|lievers to &s;alvation, than to tho&s;e that are. Hence that remark of our Savior, "he that believeth on me &s;hall never thir&s;t".<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Joh. 6.35.</NOTE> And again, "who&s;oever drinketh of the water which I &s;hall give him, &s;hall never thir&s;t" <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chap. 4.14.</NOTE> This &s;piritual water, when &s;piritually drank off, quenches the flame which be|fore occa&s;ioned the thri&s;t Our Lord therefore pro|po&s;es to tho&s;e "who thir&s;t, to come to him, and drink", as that which would quench their thir&s;t, that is, remove their unea&s;ine&s;s by removing the cau&s;e of it.</P>

But if this &s;cribe, notwith&s;tanding his "di&s;creet an&s;wer", and the unprejudiced teachable di&s;po&s;ition thereby di&s;|covered, was at the SAME DISTANCE from the kingdom of God, he would have been, had he di&s;covered gro&s;s ignorance, prejudice and per|ver&s;ene&s;s, with what propriety could our Savior declare concerning him, that he "was not far from the kingdom of God". Surely, he does not mean by this &s;aying, that he was at as great a di&s;tance as any of the &s;cribes and phari&s;ees, in that day!

<P>THERE is another &s;aying of our Savior, of the like import with this we have been upon, and that may reflect &s;till more light upon it. Tis his declaration to a number of the jewi&s;h prie&s;ts and elders in the&s;e words, "verily, I &s;ay unto you, that the publicans, and the harlots, go into the kingdom of God before you". <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. 21.31.</NOTE> If, in order to that faith which admits into God's kingdom, the minds of &s;inners need no previous preparation, but this faith may be, and always is, be&s;towed &s;o as to &s;uper&s;ede any thing of this kind, the&s;e jewi&s;h prie&s;ts might as readily have gone into the king|dom of God, as the publicans and harlots: Nor would there have been any ju&s;t rea&s;on to &s;ugge&s;t, much le&s;s to &s;ay with &s;uch po&s;itive a&s;&s;everation, that the latter would go into it before the former.
<PB N="234" REF="009925_0239_0F7B38A68CEB0990">
One would naturally &s;uppo&s;e, from this &s;aying of our Lord, that the&s;e prie&s;ts &amp; elders were in a more blind, hardened and perver&s;e &s;tate of mind, than the publicans and harlots; and le&s;s fited, on this account, for a reception of the go&s;pel, in the "ordinary way" in which God enables per&s;ons to receive it. And from what follows, it very evi|dently appears, that this was the real truth of the ca&s;e. Our Lord goes on, "for John came unto you in the way of righteou&s;ne&s;s, and ye believed him not; but the publicans and harlots believed him: And ye, when ye had &s;een it, repented not after|ward that ye might believe him". <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ver. 32, 33</NOTE> This &s;ame tho't is expre&s;&s;ed more &s;trongly by the evangeli&s;t Luke. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Luk. 7.29, 30.</NOTE> "And the publicans ju&s;tified God, be|ing bapti&s;ed with the bapti&s;m of John; but the phari&s;ees and lawyers rejected the coun&s;el of God again&s;t them&s;elves, being not bapti&s;ed of him". The plain truth is, John, the me&s;&s;enger of God to prepare the way for the Me&s;&s;iah, had endea|voured to awaken the fears of the&s;e jewi&s;h rulers, and excite in them a di&s;po&s;ition that would render the coming of Chri&s;t acceptable to them; but he could make no impre&s;&s;ion on them, tho' what he &s;aid wro't powerfully upon the publicans and harlots. They were therefore more ob&s;tinate and perver&s;e, and for that rea&s;on le&s;s likely, in the "u&s;ual way" of God's dealing with &s;inners, to become the &s;ubjects of the Me&s;&s;iah's kingdom. And this our Lord very emphatically repre&s;ents in Luke 7, from the 31&s;t to the 35th ver. where he &s;eems to be at a lo&s;s to de&s;cribe their ob&s;tinacy, and &s;carcely to know by what compari&s;on to point out their perver&s;ene&s;s, in not being wro'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> upon by

As children in a froward peevi&s;h humor, when playing together, do every thing contrary to what their companions de&s;ire and expect: So they interpreted cro&s;ly every thing that was &s;aid or done, either by John the forerunner of Chri&s;t, or by Chri&s;t him&s;elf. No arguments could per&s;uade them, no manner of behavior remove their unju&s;t prejudices. Tis quite evident, from what our Lord has thus &s;aid of the ob&s;tinacy, in&s;en&s;ibility and perver&s;e &s;pirit of the&s;e jewi&s;h teachers, that they were, upon this account, le&s;s fited and prepared to be wro't upon to come into his kingdom, than the publicans and harlots, who, being not &s;o hardened, were more ea&s;ily &s;u&s;ceptible of good impre&s;&s;ions, and therefore more likely, according to the "common way" of God's dealing with &s;inners, to go into his kingdom before them.</P>
<P>AND the &s;cripture proceeds upon this &s;ame tho't, whenever it &s;peaks, as it often does, of a greater difficulty in the way of the conver&s;ion and &s;alvation of &s;ome &s;inners than of others.

And why? Surely, not for want of power, or mercy in God; power to &s;ubdue their ob&s;tinacy, or mercy to triumph over their unworthi|ne&s;s; nor yet, for want of merit in the atoning blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t: But becau&s;e they would, in this ca&s;e, with&s;tand the highe&s;t evidence, the wi&s;dom of God &s;aw fit to lay before them for their conviction; which evidence was "the way", and the "only one", by which, as a means, he would work the work of faith in them.

Upon their "believing in him whom God hath &s;ent", they &s;hall, be they who they will, or their former ob&s;tinacy in &s;in what it will, be in&s;tantly accepted of God, and with an equal welcome. There is no rea&s;onable room for di&s;pute as to this, tis &s;o evidently the truth of revelation. But where is it &s;aid, in the in&s;pired books, or &s;o much as in&s;inuated, that there is no difference between one &s;inner and another, as to "the probability" of their thus becoming believers? Where are we told, that &s;inners are "as much in the way to faith", while run|ning from God as fa&s;t as they can, as when they are endeavouring, in the u&s;e of means, to come to him? Where is it declared to be "as likely" they &s;hould meet with "the gift of grace", while going on &s;ecurely in a cour&s;e of the gro&s;&s;e&s;timpiety, unrighteou&s;ne&s;s and intem|perance, as if, being rou&s;ed to a &s;en&s;e of &s;in and danger, they &s;hould be earne&s;tly engaged in "inquiring after God that they might find him"? This is the doctrine of our author. But while he is &s;o &s;trenuous in teach|ing, that there is no difference between &s;inners, as to "the likelihood" of their becoming believers; but that the vile&s;t and mo&s;t abandoned wretches are in "as fair a way", as any &s;inners whatever, to meet with the &s;aving truth, he ought to know, that he herein oppo&s;es, not the popular preachers only, but Je&s;us Chri&s;t and his in&s;pired apo&s;tles. For this is certainly the truth, unle&s;s a man's being "not far from the kingdom of God" means the &s;ame thing with his be|ing "at the greate&s;t di&s;tance from it"; unle&s;s "his going into this kingdom before others" &s;ignifies, that tho&s;e others are "not at all behind him" as to this go&s;pel privilege; unle&s;s his being "in a wor&s;e &s;tate", re&s;pecting his obtainment of &s;aving mercy, "than he once was" imports, that he is in "as good a one as he ever was"; unle&s;s its "being difficult", next to "impo&s;&s;ible", that he &s;hould be "renew'd to repen|tance", if he relap&s;es after he has been illuminated and ta&s;ted of the good word, conveys this idea, that tis "as ea&s;ie and as likely he &s;hould be now bro't to re|pentance as it was at fir&s;t". What &s;ad work &s;hall we make of the &s;acred books, if we force them to &s;peak at this rate? And yet, thus our author mu&s;t make them &s;peak, or there will be a palpable contradiction between what he &s;ays, and what they &s;ay. He may po&s;&s;ibly imagine he is doing honor to God, by exalting the riches and freedom of his grace; but neither the one, nor the other, can be truly exalted, by telling men who are hardening them&s;elves in wicked|ne&s;s as much as they can, that they are "as much in the way" of the &s;aving truth, and "as likely" to find it, as the mo&s;t &s;erious, concerned and inqui&s;itive &s;eekers after it. If this is not that encouraging men "to continue in &s;in that grace may abound", which the apo&s;tle Paul repels with "a God forbid" tis not ea&s;ie to &s;ay what is.</NOTE></P>

concern about eternal life is pungent &amp; pre&s;&s;ing? Who earne&s;tly &s;eek God, if perhaps they may find him, and are importunate in their applicati|ons to him, night and day, to take pity on them? Can it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that &s;uch &s;inners as the&s;e are judicially given up of God to "hardne&s;s of heart", and "blindne&s;s of mind"? That he has "ca&s;t them away from his pre&s;ence, and taken his holy &s;pirit from them"? May it not rather be &s;aid, that the good Spirit is actually &s;triving with them? And that the &s;tate of mind they are in is the effect of his influence upon them? Cer|tainly, the&s;e are not the &s;inners that are given up of God, &s;o as that the "&s;aving truth" &s;hall not be communicated to them. They are tho&s;e, on the contrary, who are &s;ecurely impious and prophane, openly vile and wicked, or &s;ecretly &s;o under the cloke of religion; they are tho&s;e, who, not having the fear of God before their eyes, go on in a cour&s;e of mocking heaven by their religious hypocri&s;ie, or of trampling on the divine authority, by giving a loo&s;e to their lu&s;ts, commiting all manner of ini|quity with greedine&s;s Hence the many pa&s;&s;ages, in the &s;acred books, which caution &s;inners "not to grieve the Spirit"; not "to re&s;i&s;t the holy Gho&s;t"; not "to harden their hearts"; not to "depart from God", but to "take heed le&s;t they be hardened thro' the deceitfulne&s;s of &s;in". It is too evident, from &s;uch texts as the&s;e, to admit of a denyal, that there is a "difference" between &s;inners, as to the "probability" of their finding mercy; and that &s;ome are in a "more hopeful way" in order to it, than others. And tis, in con|&s;equence of the real and ju&s;t import of the &s;acred texts that have been mentioned, that &s;inners may,
<PB N="242" REF="009925_0247_0F7B38AC824ABB20">
with all propriety, be called upon, and exhorted, and in a pre&s;&s;ing manner too, in&s;tantly to come to a &s;top, and not proceed a &s;tep further in their evil ways, le&s;t there &s;hould be "le&s;s likelihood" afterwards, than there is at pre&s;ent, of their finding "the &s;alutary truth".</P>
<P>BESIDES what has been already &s;aid, I may pro|perly remind you of tho&s;e numerous pa&s;&s;ages, in the in&s;pired books, which expre&s;ly direct &s;inners to the diligent u&s;e of endeavours as "the way" to God's &s;aving mercy in Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>

They very &s;olemnly command their endeavours, in the u&s;e of means; and not only &s;o, but mo&s;t evidently point them out as "the way" in which the work of God is ordi|narily "begun", as well as carried on, in them: Nor can it be rea&s;onably tho't, that the in&s;pired writers, in all parts of the bible, in the new as well as old te&s;tament, would have thus commanded and urged men to exert them&s;elves, if all exert|ments of their's would be totally u&s;ele&s;s to any &s;aving good; as not falling in with "the way of God" in communicating the gift of faith It would be a di&s;honorable reflection on them to &s;up|po&s;e, they &s;hould be chargeable with &s;o gro&s;s an incon&s;i&s;tency.</P>
<P>TIS true, &s;inners cannot, in their own &s;trength, do any thing to purpo&s;e in the bui&s;ine&s;s of reli|gion; but, thro' Chri&s;t's "&s;trengthening them, they can do all things". And if the u&s;e of their endeavours is "the way", in which God is plea&s;ed

to communicate the aids of his Spirit, the&s;e en|deavours, however weak, in&s;ufficient and con|temptible in them&s;elves, become, in this view of them, greatly &s;erviceable; yea, they are of &s;uch nece&s;&s;ary importance, that &s;inners may peri&s;h without them: And &s;hould they peri&s;h, they mu&s;t ju&s;tifie God, and blame them&s;elves: Whereas, if God be&s;tows "&s;aving faith" without human en|deavours, and &s;o as to render them vain and u&s;e|le&s;s, it will be hard to point out the rea&s;onable|ne&s;s, or fitne&s;s, of the above numerous &s;cripture-exhortations and commands; and &s;till harder to reconcile them with the ju&s;tice of God, much more his goodne&s;s and mercy, in the aggravated damnation of impenitents under the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>I MAY go on, and &s;ay &s;till more particularly, that &s;inners are directed, in the &s;acred books, to the duty of "prayer"; and this, as "the way" to obtain &s;aving mercy. Simon Magus was, with|out all doubt, a &s;inner, and a very great one too. For the apo&s;tle Peter &s;aid to him, "I perceive thou art in the gall of bitterne&s;s, and in the bond of iniquity". <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts 8.23.</NOTE> And yet, he exhorts him to "pray God if perhaps the tho't of his heart might be forgiven him". <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 22.</NOTE> And &s;hall we &s;ay, an apo&s;tle of Chri&s;t would have put him upon doing that, which was perfectly u&s;ele&s;s, in regard of the main thing he had in view in giving him this direction? Surely, he would not have advi&s;ed him to "pray", if prayer had not been, in his apprehen&s;ion, "the way" in which God was wont to be&s;tow his mer|cy in Chri&s;t. The people of I&s;rael were in the like &s;inful &s;tate, when God was plea&s;ed to declare
<PB N="245" REF="009925_0250_0F7B38B4CD721BB0">
that to be his purpo&s;e concerning them, "a new heart will I give unto you, and a new &s;pirit will I put within you; and I will take away the &s;tony heart out of your fle&s;h, and I will give you an heart of fle&s;h". <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ezek. 36.26.</NOTE> But what follows? "Thus &s;aith the Lord God, I will yet for this be enquired of by the hou&s;e of I&s;rael to do it for them". <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver 37.</NOTE> It was in "the way" of prayer for a new heart, and a new &s;pirit, that God would be&s;tow the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings, and in no other. And prayer is a duty our Savior has directed to, as "the way" in which the divine Spirit is given to beget, as well as increa&s;e grace. In what other &s;en&s;e &s;hall we explain tho&s;e words of his? "A&s;k, and it &s;hall be given you; &s;eek, and ye &s;hall find; knock, and it &s;hall be opened to you". <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Matt. 7.7.</NOTE> Were they addre&s;&s;ed to tho&s;e only, who were the &s;ubjects of the "faith by which the ju&s;t do live"? Far from this; they were deliver|ed, together with the whole &s;ermon of which they are a part, to "great multitudes" (<GAP DESC="foreign">) that followed our Lord "from Galilee, De|capolis, Jeru&s;alem, Judea, and from beyond Jor|dan". So we are authori&s;ed to &s;ay from the 28th ver. of the 7th chap. of Matthew; where it is ex|pre&s;ly declared, that "when Je&s;us had ended the&s;e &s;ayings "the people (<GAP DESC="foreign">, the multitudes) were a&s;toni&s;hed at his doctrine", that is, the mul|titudes before-mentioned. It follows, in the next ver&s;e, "and he taught THEM", that is, by ne|ce&s;&s;ary grammatical con&s;truction, the&s;e "multi|tudes", who had flocked after him. from all parts of the country. It was therefore in the hearing of a mixt and great number of per&s;ons, from all parts, among whom, perhaps, there were few,
<PB N="246" REF="009925_0251_0F7B38B5F0666950">
who had obtained the ju&s;tification of life thro' faith, that our Lord &s;aid, "a&s;k, and it &s;hall be given you; &s;eek, and ye &s;hall find; knock, and it &s;hall be opened to you". And would he have thus preached to &s;uch an audience, if it had not been his intention to put tho&s;e, who had not &s;av|ing faith, as well as tho&s;e who had, upon apply|ing to God by prayer for the influences of his Spirit? The former to begin the work of faith in them; the latter, to maintain, and increa&s;e it in their hearts. It cannot rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed. His directing them to prayer is, indeed, in it&s;elf &s;imply con&s;idered, a good rea&s;on why prayer &s;hould be looked upon as "the way" of God in be&s;tow|ing his Spirit to the purpo&s;es of &s;aving good. He would not otherwi&s;e have given this direction. It &s;uppo&s;es the go&s;pel-plan of mercy, and that God may, in con&s;i&s;tency with the honor of his ju&s;tice, holine&s;s and wi&s;dom, be&s;tow that grace upon &s;inners they are directed to &s;eek to him for, notwith&s;tanding their &s;infulne&s;s and unworthine&s;s, however hainou&s;ly aggravated; yea, it &s;uppo&s;es God's readine&s;s, in "this way", to communicate his Spirit to all the valuable ends to which he is needed. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It will be ob&s;erved, by tho&s;e who are in any mea&s;ure critical, that I have all along &s;poken of the u&s;e of prayer and other means, as "the way" in which God is plea&s;ed "ordinarily" to communicate the grace that is &s;aving; purpo&s;ely avoiding to affirm, that he has, by "direct promi&s;e", con&s;tituted &s;uch a connecti|on between the "u&s;e of the&s;e means", and the "be|&s;towment of &s;aving grace", as that the latter &s;hall certainly take place upon the former. Perhaps, this is a real truth, and as plainly revealed, in the bible, as that God, by his "promi&s;e", has given believers unto life rea&s;on to hope, that they &s;hall be &s;till "&s;tronger in the grace which is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us", up|on their u&s;e of the means he has appointed to this end. But without in&s;i&s;ting upon this, (which I have accordingly waved, as tis a matter in di&s;pute among the be&s;t and greate&s;t of men) all rea&s;onable pretence for want of encouragement to human endeavours is &s;uper&s;eded, if the u&s;e of the&s;e is "the way" in which God "ordinarily" be&s;tows his &s;aving mercy in Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>The &s;inner, it may be, will plead, if God has not "oblig"d him&s;elf to &s;ucceed men's endeavours; if he has no where "promi&s;ed" that, if they exert them|&s;elves, as they may, in the u&s;e of means, he will cer|tainly reward their well-meant efforts with the com|munications of his grace; to what purpo&s;e &s;hould I attempt to do any thing in the affairs of religion? What encouragement have I to do &s;o? When I have done all I can, God may with-hold his graec; and then, I am but where I was, and may, notwith|&s;tanding all my endeavours, &s;uffer the pains of Hell.</P>
<P>Should this be &s;uppo&s;ed, would your puni&s;hment, in the place of "weeping and gna&s;hing of teeth", be equally dreadful, whether you did your be&s;t in the u&s;e of means, or went on in your &s;ins, throwing contempt on the authority and government of God? There is no room for di&s;pute as to this. You would certainly be more mi&s;erable beyond the grave, in proportion to your neglects of God, and the acts of your rebel|lion again&s;t him.</P>
<P>But (to expre&s;s my&s;elf in the words of the celebrated Mr. How.) "Why &s;houlde&s;t thou imagine &s;o &s;ad
<Q>an i&s;&s;ue, as that, after thine utmo&s;t endeavours, grace &s;hould be with-held, and leave thee to peri&s;h, becau&s;e God hath not bound him&s;elf by promi&s;e to thee? What promi&s;e have the ravens to be heard, when they cry? But thou art a &s;inner. True.&mdash; Yet experience tells the world, God's "unpromi|&s;ed" mercies freely flow every where. "The whole earth is full of his goodne&s;s". Yea; "but his &s;pecial grace is conveyed by promi&s;e only, and that only thro' Chri&s;t; and how can it be commu|nicated, thro' him, to any but tho&s;e that are in him"? What then: Is "the fir&s;t in-being in Chri&s;t no &s;pecial grace"? Or is there any "being in him" before the "fir&s;t", that &s;hould be the ground of that gracious communication? Things are plain enough, if we make them not intricate, or intangle our&s;elves by fooli&s;h &s;ubtilties.</Q>
&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>Poor &s;oul, thou neede&s;t not &s;tay to puzzle thy&s;elf about this matter. "God binds him&s;elf to do what he promi&s;es"; but hath he any where "bound him&s;elf, to do no more"? Did he promi&s;e thee thy being, or that thou &s;houlde&s;t live to this day? Did he promi&s;e thee the bread that &s;u&s;tains thee, the daily comforts of thy life? Yea, what is nearer the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, did he promi&s;e thee a &s;tation under the Go&s;pel? Or that thou &s;houlde&s;t ever hear the name of Chri&s;t? If ever his &s;pirit has, in any de|gree, moved upon thy heart, inclined thee at all &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider thy eternal concernments, did he before-hand make thee any promi&s;e of that?</Q></P>
<P><Q>My friend, con&s;ider a little, tis HOPE that is the great engine that moves the world, that keeps all &s;orts of men in action. Doth the hu&s;bandman "foreknow", when he plows and &s;ows, that the crop will an&s;wer his co&s;t and pains? Does the merchant "foreknow", when he imbarques his goods, he &s;hall have a &s;afe and gainful return? Do&s;t thou "foreknow", when thou eate&s;t, it &s;hall refre&s;h thee? When thou take&s;t phy&s;ick, that it &s;hall recover thy health, and &s;ave thy life? Yea further, can the covetous man pretend a "promi&s;e", that his unju&s;t practices &s;hall enrich him? The ambitious, that he &s;hall be great and honourable? The voluptuous, that his plea&s;ure &s;hall be always unmixt with gall and wormwood? Can any &s;ay, they ever had a "promi&s;e" to a&s;certain them, that prophane&s;s and &s;en&s;uality would bring them to Heaven? That an ungodly and di&s;&s;olute life would end in ble&s;&s;edne&s;s? Here the Lord knows, men can be confident and active enough, without a "pro|mi&s;e, and again&s;t many an expre&s;s threatning. Will thou not, upon the HOPE thou ha&s;t before thee, do as much for thy &s;oul, for eternal ble&s;&s;ed|ne&s;s, as men do for uncertain riches, &s;hort plea&s;ures, an airy &s;oon-bla&s;ted name? Yea, as much as men de&s;perably do to damn them&s;elves, and purcha&s;e their own &s;wift de&s;truction.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Or can'&s;t thou pretend, tho' thou ha&s;t no pre-a&s;&s;uring promi&s;e, thou ha&s;t no HOPE? Is it nothing to have heard &s;o much of God's gracious nature? Is it &s;uitable to the reports, and di&s;coveries he hath made of him&s;elf, to let a poor wretch peri&s;h at his feet, that lies pro&s;trate there, expecting his mercy? Did&s;t thou ever hear, he was &s;o little a lover of &s;ouls? Do his giving of his &s;on, his earne&s;t un|wearied &s;trivings with &s;inners, his long patience, the clear beams of go&s;pel-light, the amiable appear|ances of his grace, give ground for no better, no kinder tho'ts of him? Yea, hath he not expre&s;ly &s;tiled him&s;elf, "the God hearing prayer", taken a name on purpo&s;e to encourage "all fle&s;h to come. to him"? Wilt thou dare then to adopt tho&s;e pro|phane words, "what profit is there to pray to him"? and &s;ay, tis better &s;it &s;till, re&s;olving to peri&s;h, than addre&s;s to him, or &s;eek his favor, becau&s;e he hath not "by promi&s;e", a&s;&s;ured thee of the i&s;&s;ue, and that, if he &s;u&s;pends his grace, all thou do&s;t will be in vain?</Q></P>
<P><Q>How woulde&s;t thou judge of the like re&s;olution? If the hu&s;bandman &s;hould &s;ay, when I have &s;pent my pains and co&s;t in breaking up and preparing the earth, and ca&s;ting in my &s;eed; if the &s;un &s;hine not, and the rain fall not in &s;ea&s;on, if the influence of heaven be &s;u&s;pended, if he withold his ble&s;&s;ing, or if an invading enemy anticipate my harve&s;t, all I do and expend is to no purpo&s;e; and God hath not a&s;certained me of the contrary, by 'expre&s;s promi&s;e; tis as good therefore &s;it &s;till.

<HEAD>SERMON X.</HEAD>
<P>SEVERAL objections, and of &s;ome weight, may be made again&s;t what has been offered, in the preceding di&s;cour&s;es. My intention is, to propo&s;e the&s;e objections di&s;tinctly, and to give the proper an&s;wers to them: And, with the doing of this I &s;hall conclude this &s;ubject I have been &s;o long upon.</P>
<P>OBJ. I. THE fir&s;t objection is, faith is wro't by an immediate act of God's power, in which men are only the &s;ubjects of what he works in them. There is no more of man in the be&s;tow|ment of faith, than there was in bringing Chri&s;t from heaven to be "a propitiation for the &s;ins of the world".</P>
<P>I ANSWER. Should this be the truth; &s;hould it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that faith is a "gift of God", in which men are nothing more than the "pa&s;&s;ive recipients" of what he be&s;tows, it will not from hence follow, that human endeavours, in the &s;en&s;e we have explained them, are needle&s;s, as being of no u&s;e, or &s;ervice. For God may, if he plea&s;es, as well make awaken'd &s;eeking &s;inners,
<PB N="253" REF="009925_0258_0F7B38BC43327758">
the &s;ubjects of this gift, as the &s;tupidly tho'tle&s;s and &s;ecure; he may as well di&s;play his almighty power, in giving men to believe, while exerting their powers as rea&s;onable creatures, about their duty, as when they make no u&s;e of them, but are &s;hamefully carele&s;s and indolent. It lies with him to chu&s;e his own way to be&s;tow the gift of faith; and, if he chu&s;es to be&s;tow it, rather upon inquir|ing, &s;eeking &s;inners, than others; upon men, while acting like rea&s;onable creatures, rather than while they are &s;en&s;ele&s;ly &s;iting &s;till, and doing nothing, "who &s;hall &s;ay unto him, what doe&s;t thou"? Mo&s;t certainly God is ma&s;ter of his own gifts, and may be&s;tow them in what way he plea&s;es. And for any to di&s;pute this is, in reality of con&s;truction, to &s;ay, that God has no right to "do what he will with his own"; tis to oppo&s;e that "&s;overeignty", which, at other times, is &s;trenuou&s;ly pleaded for, as one of the di&s;tingui&s;h|ing glories of the &s;upreme being.</P>
<P>BUT &s;hould it turn out a truth, that, in the be&s;towment of faith, men are more than the pa&s;&s;ive &s;ubjects" of a gift; that God accom|pli&s;hes this part of his good plea&s;ure in them, by the u&s;e of means, and the concurring operation of the intellectual faculties with which he has en|dowed them, what has been di&s;cour&s;ed about human endeavours, in&s;tead of carrying with it the face of ab&s;urdity, will at once appear mo&s;t highly congruous. There is evidently, in this view of the matter, a natural aptitude in the pre&s;cribed means, and men's u&s;e of them, in order to the obtainment of faith. Tis in rea&s;on fit, they &s;hould exert them&s;elves in earne&s;t endeavours, if
<PB N="254" REF="009925_0259_0F7B38BD0DF499F0">
tis, by co-operating with tho&s;e endeavours, that God communicates the light and help, whereby faith is wro't in them. The work is now ac|compli&s;ht in a way accommodated to the human make. Men are dealt with as intelligent and moral agents. For tho' tis God principally that does the work; yet, in the doing of it, he con|&s;iders the con&s;titution of men, and operates by the intervention of their faculties, and in a way adapted to their proper nature.</P>
<P>AND this way of communicating the gift of faith appears, to me, to be mo&s;t rea&s;onable in it&s;elf, and mo&s;t con&s;onant to the &s;cripture-account of the matter.</P>
<P>IF we con&s;ult our own rea&s;on, it perfectly falls in with all we are able to collect from it, to &s;uppo&s;e, that God, in "drawing &s;inners to Chri&s;t", &s;hould do it "with the cords of a man, and the bands of love", that is, by co-operating with hu|man faculties, in the u&s;e of proper means. Tis true, had men's faculties been de&s;troyed by the original lap&s;e, or any thing con&s;equent thereupon, the&s;e faculties mu&s;t be re&s;tored, if at all re&s;tored, by an exertment of almighty power, without their doing any thing, in any kind whatever: But, as they &s;till exi&s;t men, endowed with intel|lectual and moral powers, and capable of u&s;ing them, it &s;hould &s;eem rea&s;onable to think, that God, when he works faith in them, &s;hould do it in a way adju&s;ted to their character; that is, by the intervention of their faculties, in the u&s;e of &s;uitably adapted means.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="009925_0260_0F7B38BE021A0278">AND this is evidently the way, the &s;cripture has pointed out. Why el&s;e has it made faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t a commanded duty? Why has it urged this duty, by declaring, that if we "believe we &s;hall be &s;aved", but if we "believe not we &s;hall be damned"? This does not look, as tho' faith was a work of God, &s;o as that men were only the "pa&s;&s;ive recipients" of it, as a gift from him. They are certainly con&s;idered as agents, and accountable ones too, in the bui&s;ine&s;s of faith. But where would be the propriety, or indeed con&s;i&s;tency, of their being viewed in this light, if faith was the work of God, &s;o as to &s;uper&s;ede the intervening operation of their faculties, in the u&s;e of means, and endeavours? Was this the way, in which faith was wro't, they might as well be commanded, upon pain of damnation, aggra|vated damnation, to bring that truth down from heaven, which is the object of faith, as to believe this truth now tis already bro't down, and reveal|ed in the &s;acred &s;criptures. Be&s;ides, if faith was the work of God, &s;o as that men are nothing more than the "pa&s;&s;ive &s;ubjects" of what he does, and all means and human endeavours, in the u&s;e of them are &s;et a&s;ide, as having no concurring influence, why were &s;o many miracles wro't by Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles, in confirmation of the truths they publi&s;hed to the world, as &s;ent from God? Why are men complained of, charged with guilt, and declared worthy of an aggravated puni&s;hment for not being wro't upon to believe, in con&s;equence of the&s;e atte&s;tations from heaven, in proof of the go&s;pel-revelation? Why are they applied to in all the ways that are rationally &s;uited to work upon moral and intelligent agents? It
<PB N="256" REF="009925_0261_0F7B38BE8FB76448">
would be gro&s;ly ab&s;urd thus to adre&s;s to them, if the "&s;alutary truth" was conveyed into them, without the concurrence of their faculties, in the u&s;e of means.</P>
<P>TIS ob&s;ervable, tho' God is &s;poken of, in the &s;cripture, as "the author of faith"; yet that is the inquiry of in&s;piration, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. 10.14, 15.</NOTE> "How &s;hall they call on him, in whom they have not believed? And how &s;hall they believe in him, of whom they have not heard? And how &s;hall they hear with|out a preacher"? And that is the apo&s;tolic con|clu&s;ion deduced herefrom, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 17.</NOTE> "So then, faith coming by hearing, and hearing by the word of God". You &s;ee, in order to believing, there mu&s;t be preaching, and this by per&s;ons duly au|thori&s;ed and &s;ent to preach; and the word preach|ed mu&s;t be heard, that is, heedfully, diligently, &s;eriou&s;ly attended to. Here then there is both room and opportunity for the exerci&s;e of human faculties; and tis by the exerci&s;e of them, that God, by his Spirit, concurs to the production of faith. Men are "workers together with God" in this chri&s;tian attainment; in&s;omuch, that if they neglect to exert their own powers, in the u&s;e of the means and advantages they are favoured with, they can reflect the blame no where, but on them&s;elves, if they are never made the &s;ub|jects of that faith, by which "the ju&s;t do live". This will be the true rea&s;on of their condemna|tion; and it will eternally ju&s;tifie God in it, before all angels and men.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="009925_0262_0F7B38BF404F9AE8">TIS a plain ca&s;e, the &s;cripture every where con&s;iders &s;inners, as beings that are endowed with intellectual and moral powers, and accordingly repre&s;ents God as FIRST BEGINNING, and then CARRYING ON, the work of faith, in a way anala|gous to their proper character as &s;uch, by making u&s;e of "means", and by requiring "their attenti|on" to them, and the "exertment" of all their powers, in &s;ubordination to him, and the concur|ring influences of his Spirit. He don't introduce faith into them, as into beings that are not agents; neither does he make them believers, by giving them new faculties, or by de&s;troying, or effecting any phy&s;ical change in, their old; but accompli&s;h|es his plea&s;ure in them, by accommodating his agency to their proper make and con&s;titution. The bible always con&s;iders the matter in this light. And it would, in truth, be quite unintelligible upon a contrary &s;cheme of tho't.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See what is more largely &s;aid, upon human endea|vours in the latter part of the 12th Sermon.</NOTE></P>
<P>OBJ. II. ANOTHER objection is, to urge men, before they have faith, that is, &s;aving faith, to religious doing, is to invert the &s;cripture-order. Tis to make that precede, which &s;hould follow after. Tis to put the effect before the cau&s;e. What more ab&s;urd, than to call upon men to work in order to faith, when they can really do no work at all, till they are the &s;ubjects of faith? The apo&s;tles did not proceed after this unnatural manner. They fir&s;t laid before men the &s;imple truth of the go&s;pel. Some believed.&mdash;And, up|on this, they put them upon endeavours to "walk in newne&s;s of life".</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="009925_0263_0F7B38C11C8329F0">HOW far any may have put men upon acting from faith before they had it, and in order to their having it, I will not, at pre&s;ent, take upon me to &s;ay; Tho' if they have really done thus, they are doubtle&s;s chargeable with great ab&s;urdity. For no man can do an action from a principle he is not endowed with, and to put him upon it is to put him upon doing that which is NATURALLY IMPOSSIBLE. But this is not the ca&s;e, as we have &s;tated it. We call no man to endeavours, that will argue his being a &s;ubject of &s;aving faith, in order to his becoming &s;o. We put him upon no exertments, but from principles he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of. And endeavours, from &s;uch principles, in order to his obtaining &s;till higher and more noble ones, are what he is capable of; yea, God re|quires them, and they are "the way" (as we have &s;een) in which he "ordinarily" be&s;tows his Spirit to the purpo&s;es of &s;aving and everla&s;ting good.</P>
<P>TIS true, upon men's obtaining faith, they be|come capable of acting from this principle; and there are many apo&s;tolic exhortations, per&s;ua&s;ions, and directions, given to them as believers. And it is thro' faith, under the influence of God's mighty power, that the &s;piritual life is nouri&s;hed in them, to their growing in grace, and a greater meetne&s;s for that life that is eternal in heaven. But tis, at the &s;ame time, far from being true, that there are no commands and exhortations given in &s;cripture to per&s;ons, while de&s;titute of ju&s;tifying faith. When our Savior preached, &s;ay|ing, "repent ye, and believe the go&s;pel", <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mark 1.15.</NOTE> his hearers, for the generality, were of this &s;ort.
<PB N="259" REF="009925_0264_0F7B38C1A7AD93D8" MS="y">
When he &s;aid, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John 6.29.</NOTE> "this is the work of God", the work God requires of you, "that ye believe in him whom he hath &s;ent", he &s;pake, to tho&s;e, who followed him "for the loaves", and not "the miracles" which he had wro't. And when the apo&s;tle Paul publi&s;hed it as the will of God, now the go&s;pel-di&s;pen&s;ation had taken place, "that all men every where &s;hould repent", <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts 17.30.</NOTE> he prin|cipally had in view the &s;inners we are &s;peaking of. And &s;inners, while viewed as de&s;titute of &s;av|ing faith, are, in innumerable places, in the &s;acred books, the immediate &s;ubjects of the divine ex|hortations and commands; <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">See the texts particularly mentioned, pag. 242.</NOTE> yea, and the&s;e are urged with every argument, that is &s;uited to work upon rea&s;onable creatures. Every power of the human mind is apply'd to, and every motive u&s;ed, that can be fetched, either from earth heaven, or hell.</P>
<P>NOR is it true, that the apo&s;tles took no other care of tho&s;e, who were believers, than to lay before them the &s;imple &s;aving truth of the go&s;|pel. They not only did this, but endeavoured to do that al&s;o, which might have a natural apti|tude, a rational tendency, under the divine ble&s;&s;ing, to beget faith in them. <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">See what is &s;aid upon this head, in pag. 224, 225, 226.</NOTE></P>
<P>IT may with propriety be added here, In the fir&s;t days of the go&s;pel (as has been the ca&s;e ever &s;ince) there were two &s;orts of believers; &s;uch as were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of faith, which, tho' real, was &s;hort of that which is ju&s;tifying; and &s;uch as were en|dowed
<PB N="260" REF="009925_0265_0F7B38C24F1B4770">
with the faith that is unto life. This is repre&s;ented by our Savior under a variety of &s;imi|litudes: by the ten virgins, five whereof were wi&s;e, and five fooli&s;h; and by the parables of the talents, of the pounds, of the wheat and tares, and of the &s;ower that &s;owed &s;eed in four &s;everal &s;orts of ground. And all the churches gather|ed by the apo&s;tles con&s;i&s;ted of the&s;e two &s;orts of believers. Some had faith in the &s;aving &s;en&s;e, others had only &s;uch a faith as might be the effect of the common illuminations and a&s;&s;i&s;tances of the Spirit. This now being a known truth, ma|ny of the commands, exhortations, per&s;ua&s;ions and encouragements, which were directed, by our Savior, to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ievers in general; and, by the apo&s;tles, to the churches as collective bodies, may rea&s;onably be looked upon as de&s;igned for the u&s;e and benefit of tho&s;e, who had not &s;aving faith, as well as tho&s;e who had it. When they are exhorted and per&s;uaded, not "to draw back"; to "hold fa&s;t the profe&s;&s;ion of their faith", to "labor that they may enter into re&s;t"; to be "circum&s;pect, watch and pray"; not to "harden their hearts"; not to "depart from the living God"; not to "grieve the holy Spirit"; not to "neglect the a&s;&s;embling them&s;elves together"; to "draw nigh to God"; to examine them&s;elves, &amp; to eat of that bread, and drink of that cup", and the like: The&s;e exhortations are equally proper to both the&s;e &s;orts of believers; and they might both of them, from the faith they were re&s;pective|ly the &s;ubjects of, exert them&s;elves in expre&s;&s;ing a regard to them. And, in truth, no good rea|&s;on can be given, why the means of grace, the advantages of the vi&s;ible kingdom of God, &s;hould
<PB N="261" REF="009925_0266_0F7B38C3075A9568">
not be intended for the &s;piritual advantage of believers in common; that is, of believers who are not as yet in a &s;tate of ju&s;tification, as well as tho&s;e who are. Tis certainly fact, that all who made a profe&s;&s;ion of faith, in the days of the apo&s;tles, whether their faith was of the "com|mon", or "&s;pecial" kind, were admitted to a participation in all vi&s;ible go&s;pel privileges; and the&s;e priveleges are, in their nature, happily cal|culated to promote the &s;piritual good of all that have faith, whether of the "common", or "&s;av|ing" &s;ort. Tis po&s;&s;ible in the moral, tho' not in the natural world, that "tares", by proper means and due culture, may, under the divine influence, be converted into good "wheat". And this was, doubtle&s;s, the ca&s;e oftentimes in the days of the apo&s;tles; as it may have been in all ages &s;ince. Nor unle&s;s we &s;uppo&s;e, that go&s;|pel-means may be u&s;ed by believers, who have not as yet attained to the faith that ju&s;tifies, &s;hall we find it an ea&s;ie matter to account for the conduct of the apo&s;tles, in "immediately" admiting per&s;ons to "bapti&s;m", and "fellow&s;hip in break|ing of bread", upon their profe&s;&s;ion of faith in Chri&s;t: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tis indubitably true, that the fir&s;t preachers of the religion of Je&s;us readily admitted all, who profe&s;&s;ed faith in him, to an attendance on go&s;pel-in&s;titutions, upon their bare profe&s;&s;ion, without waiting for proof that their faith was that by which "the ju&s;t do live". This appears from the ca&s;e of the Ethiopian eunuch, who&s;e conviction that Je&s;us was the Chri&s;t, confe&s;&s;ion of him as &s;uch, and bapti&s;m in his name, were all com|pleated within the &s;pace of a few hours only, Acts 8. from the 27th ver. The &s;ame thing is equally evi|dent from what is &s;aid of the Jailor, and tho&s;e that were in his hou&s;e. The apo&s;tles, Paul and Silas, had &s;carce done "&s;peaking the word of the Lord" to them, before they "bapti&s;ed" them all. They did it "&s;trait|way, the &s;ame hour of the night", Acts 16.33. In like manner, the "three thou&s;and", &s;poken of in the 2d chap, of this &s;ame book, were, within the &s;pace of a &s;ingle day, convinced that "Je&s;us who had been crucified was Lord and Chri&s;t, bapti&s;ed, added to the church", and admited to "fellow&s;hip with the apo&s;tles in breaking of bread, and in prayers". Nor do we read of any, who confe&s;&s;ed Chri&s;t, who&s;e bapti&s;m, or reception into chri&s;tian communion, were delayed by the apo&s;tles; but their manner was "immediately" to admit them as di&s;ciples barely upon this profe&s;&s;ion. Surely, they would not have been thus ha&s;ty in admit|ing per&s;ons to a participation in go&s;pel-ordinances, had they imagined, that chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ors might not "draw near to God", till the truth had been SAVING|LY received into their hearts. Had they tho't, with our author, that "all the exhortations, commands, and in&s;titutions of the go&s;pel, were directed to con&s;ci|ences endued with this new in&s;tinct", it can't be &s;up|po&s;ed, without reflecting di&s;honor on their character, that they would at once, without the lea&s;t delay, have admited all kinds of per&s;ons to fellow&s;hip with them in the kingdom of Chri&s;t. It might rather have been expected, that they would have taken time to in&s;truct, advi&s;e and guard their hearers; and have waited for credible evidence, in the judgment of charity, that they were believers in the SAVING &s;en&s;e, before they put them upon attending on the in&s;titutions of chri&s;tianity. Had they e&s;teemed it a truth, that the&s;e in&s;titutions were appointed for the ob&s;ervance of none but tho&s;e, who were in a "ju&s;tified &s;tate by faith", tis incredible they &s;hould have been active in encouraging &s;uch numbers to ob&s;erve them, upon a verbal profe&s;&s;ion only, before there had been opportunity for the tryal of their faith, or the exhibition of proper proof that it was of the SAVING &s;ort. And what makes this the more incredible is, that they had been &s;ufficiently taught by our Savior, before he left the world, that meerly a profe&s;&s;ion of faith was no good proof, in the ca&s;e of any, that they were SAVINGLY the &s;ubjects of it. Multitudes, in his day, &s;o believed on him, as, in tran&s;port of joy, to profe&s;s them&s;elves his di&s;ciples; and yet, after a while, they "went back", and &s;o totally as to "walk no more with him", Joh. 6.66. Great numbers flocked to the bapti&s;m of John; but it became matter of ob&s;ervation, yea, and of offence to the phari&s;ees, that "Je&s;us made more di&s;ciples" than his forerunner, permiting them al&s;o to be "bapti&s;ed", Joh. 4.1. And yet, the writer of the book of the Acts, &s;peaking of our Lord's di&s;ciples, ju&s;t after his re|&s;urrection, &s;ays, "the number of names together was a|bout an hundred and twenty", Acts 1.15. What an amazing falling away of Chri&s;t's di&s;ciples mu&s;t there have been, by this account! The apo&s;tles could not but know it. They knew al&s;o, that our Lord had &s;aid to tho&s;e, who had profe&s;&s;ed faith in him, Joh. 8.31. "if ye continue in my word, then are ye my di&s;ciples indeed": And in words &s;till more explicit, Matth. 7.21. "not every one that faith unto me, Lord, Lord, &s;hall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doth the will of my father which is in heaven". It ought not therefore to be &s;uppo&s;ed, when the apo&s;tles &s;o &s;uddenly admited per&s;ons to bapti&s;m, &amp; communion in go&s;pel-ordinances, upon a meer verbal profe&s;&s;ion of faith, that they ima|gined this profe&s;&s;ion gave credible proof that they were believers in the SAVING &s;en&s;e, or that they looked up|on them as &s;uch. Tis far more rea&s;onable to think, that they under&s;tood, by the faith men profe&s;&s;ed, no more than &s;uch a conviction that "Je&s;us was the Chri&s;t", as to be there-from di&s;po&s;ed and influenced to a readine&s;s to own him as their Savior and ma&s;ter; to put them&s;elves, as di&s;ciples, under his care, guidance and tuition; and to be found in the u&s;e of his appoint|ments, as the be&s;t method they could take to be further enlightened, in&s;tructed, improved, and "trained up in the way they &s;hould go", in order to their finding eter|nal life. If go&s;pel-in&s;titutions are con&s;idered as a means wi&s;ely fited to cultivate and make the be&s;t of &s;uch a faith as this, and as de&s;igned by God to be u&s;ed, by tho&s;e who have it, to this end; the conduct of the apo&s;tles will need nothing to be &s;aid in its vin|dication. It was ju&s;t &s;uch as it was fit and rea&s;onable it &s;hould be. Tis beyond doubt with me, that this was their &s;entiment concerning the&s;e in&s;titutions; and that this al&s;o was their view in admiting the&s;e profe&s;&s;ors to an attendance on them. Surely, they did not take them into their chri&s;tian fellow&s;hip, upon the pre&s;ump|tion that they were the &s;ubjects of a faith that was SAVING; for they had no credible evidence to ground &s;uch a pre&s;umption on, in the judgment of the large&s;t charity. They had rea&s;on rather for fear, lea&s;t the faith of, by far the greater part of them was no other, than that common one, which might con&s;i&s;t with their peri&s;hing beyond the grave. But &s;till, if go&s;pel-in&s;titutions were a &s;uitably adapted means to BEGET, as well as increa&s;e, SAVING &s;aith, they acted a wi&s;e and faithful part in "immediately" admiting the&s;e profe&s;&s;ors to the u&s;e of them; as hereby they put them into the "mo&s;t likely way" of becoming chri&s;tians formed to a "meetne&s;s for the inheritance of the &s;anctified by faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t". Unle&s;s the apo&s;tles acted upon this &s;uppo&s;ition, I confe&s;s my own inability to ju&s;tify the wi&s;dom of their conduct, or indeed its faithfulne&s;s either to God, or men.

I don't remember, that our author has particularly made this repre&s;enta|tion of them. But others, and of con&s;iderable reputa|tion in the learned world, have expre&s;ly con&s;idered them in this point of view; but without &s;ufficient warrant, as I imagine, either from rea&s;on, or &s;cripture. The late reverend Mr. Experience Mayhew, who was exceeded by few, if any, among us, in the &s;trength of his rea&s;oning powers, and might truly be called a great Divine, notwith&s;tanding his di&s;advantageous circum&s;tances for learned improvements; having &s;pent a long life in mini&s;terial &s;ervices, upon an unrea&s;onably &s;canty maintainance, to the Indian-natives, in &s;everal of their ob&s;cure villages: This gentleman, tho' a known, profe&s;&s;ed Calvini&s;t, even upon the &s;upra|lap&s;arian &s;cheme, in his book entitled, "Grace de|fended", has &s;o clearly and judiciou&s;ly handled this point, as to leave no rea&s;onable room for further di&s;|pute about it. See from page 148 to 153. I &s;hall only &s;elect a few of his thot's, in the following words.
<Q>Many of the materially good actions, which unre|generate per&s;ons perform, are the effects of the grace of God in and upon them; and therefore not &s;ins. I cannot think, that actions which men perform by the help, and influence, of the word, and Spirit of God, are well called &s;ins. God may be truly &s;aid to be the author of &s;uch actions. It is he, of his grace, who &s;tirs up, and excites, poor &s;inful creatures to perform the actions I &s;peak of. He enables them to hear, read, meditate, and pray; and he is the author of &s;uch faith as they have, who believe only for a while, as in Luk. 8.13. Or may it not be granted, that &s;uch faith, repentance, &amp;c. as the be&s;t, of which unregenerate per&s;ons are &s;ome|times the &s;ubjects, are effects of the grace of God, wro't by God's word and Spirit in their &s;ouls, and frequently called <HI>common grace?</HI> And are they, this notwith&s;tanding, all &s;in, abomination in God's &s;ight; and, as &s;ome &s;ay, contrary to &s;aving grace? I con|&s;tantly maintain, that there is a <HI>&s;pecifical</HI> difference between common grace, and that which is &s;pecial; but I &s;ee no rea&s;on to oppo&s;e them one to the other, as <HI>contraries</HI> are oppo&s;ed. Whether, by common grace, we under&s;tand tho&s;e gracious influences of God's Spirit, with which the unregenerate are &s;ome|times times favored, or the good effects produced in them by the&s;e gracious operations, I am not, for my part, willing to allow them to be &s;in.</Q>
Pag. 151. He &s;ays, in the next page,
<Q>If the be&s;t actions of the unregenerate be truly and properly &s;ins, I &s;ee no rea&s;on, for the pre&s;ent, but that it were better they were let alone than done. If it be &s;aid, tho' the doing of them be &s;in, yet it is a greater greater &s;in to omit them; I an&s;wer, that if they are properly &s;ins, I know not of any rule men have, of two &s;ins to chu&s;e the lea&s;t. I believe that neither the one, nor the other, ought to be cho&s;en; but that both ought to be abhorred. Indeed, of two things where one is le&s;s good than the other, if both cannot be done, the be&s;t ought to be made choice of; but where both the things in que&s;tion are properly &s;ins, this is not the ca&s;e.</Q>
He adds,
<Q>I believe, that if the be&s;t actions (if I may may &s;o &s;peak) of the unregenerate were really &s;ins, all the regenerate would be obliged to repent of all they did before their regeneration, and in order to it; as their reading, hearing, meditating, praying for converting grace, giving alms, &amp;c.. I confe&s;s, they ought to repent that they performed the&s;e things in no better a manner than they did; but not that they did them at all: Tho' they did them not in &s;uch a manner as the regenerate only can perform actions in re&s;pect of the matter, or general nature of them.</Q></NOTE> <HI>&s;hining &s;ins,</HI> than

<P><PB N="267" REF="009925_0272_0F7B38C906232AC0">I ANSWER. The que&s;tion is not, of what real value are the&s;e doings of &s;inners?

be&s;towments, whether to &s;aints, or &s;inners. And if, upon this foundation, God has directed to human endeavours as "the way" in which he chu&s;es to be&s;tow his &s;aving mercy, who &s;hall di&s;|pute his plea&s;ure? The only proper que&s;tion therefore here is, has God pointed out the&s;e en|deavours as "the way" in which he "ordinarily" di&s;pen&s;es his grace? If this is the truth, and ap|pears to be &s;o from the &s;acred &s;criptures, as well as experience, tis to no purpo&s;e to di&s;pute about their true moral intrin&s;ick worth. For whether they are of great, or little, or no value at all, in them&s;elves &s;imply con&s;idered; yet, if God re|quires them, and, in the u&s;e of them, effects the work of grace in the hearts of &s;inners, they be|come valuable in this relative view, yea, to an high degree important and nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>TIS true, when the performances of &s;inners in religion are nothing more than form and cere|mony; when their main view in what they do, is to be "&s;een of men, and to have glory from them"; when they "make long prayers" for a di&s;gui&s;e "to devour widow's hou&s;es, and appear to be righteous that they may, with greater ad|vantage, carry on &s;ome wicked de&s;ign: What they thus do, however &s;pecious it may &s;eem to men, is abomination to the Lord: Nor can &s;uch doings be well &s;poken of with too great &s;everity. But the &s;ame ought not to be &s;aid of the religious endeavours of awaken'd &s;inners, who tremble for fear of God, and the wrath to come; who are earne&s;t in their enquiries what they &s;hall do to be &s;aved, and do with their might whatever they apprehend to be their duty, and this with &s;eriou&s;|ne&s;s,

The difference between them is great and &s;triking. And that God, who&s;e eyes run too and fro thro' the whole earth, &s;ees the difference, and will accordingly make a different e&s;timate of them. He won't indeed e&s;teem the&s;e awaken'd per&s;ons to be gracious ones, as this may not be the truth of their character; but he may take occa&s;ion from the &s;tate of mind they are in, and the con&s;equent operation of it (in the production of which his own Spirit has had a great influence) to di&s;play his mercy in Je&s;us Chri&s;t towards them.

&s;ouls <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Our author, in order to counter-act "the large work that is cut out", by the popular preachers", for the pride of the devotees in this doctrine about convictions of guilt", introduces the following illu&s;tration, pag. 290.
<Q>If two men are led to execution for the &s;ame crime, the one over-whelm'd in &s;orrow, and the other ele|vated to noi&s;ie mirth by &s;trong drink, we ju&s;tly reckon the condition of the latter to be fully as mi&s;erable as the former; and if mercy re&s;pects meer mi&s;ery, wretchedne&s;s, and unworthine&s;s, it will certainly as readily regard the mi&s;erable per&s;on, as him who has the quicke&s;t feeling of what is before him: Otherwi&s;e it behoved to regard the one, as more worthy than his fellow; which would be in|con&s;i&s;tent with the nature of mercy, at lea&s;t that of divine mercy; for wherever the lea&s;t degree of worth appears, there the province of mercy cea&s;es, and that of ju&s;tice and equity takes place.</Q>
The ca&s;e, as here put, is far from being placed in a fair or ju&s;t point of light. Who ever &s;aid, or tho't, that a &s;inner, by being bro't under "a work of conviction", became a "worthy" object of the divine notice? Or that he now had that about him which made it a matter of "ju&s;tice", or "equity", in God to &s;hew regard to him? Sinners in common, whether &s;en&s;ible or in|&s;en&s;ible, were viewed by God, when he laid the plan of redeeming grace, in all their unworthine&s;s; and notwith&s;tanding their unworthine&s;s, whether more or le&s;s, he was plea&s;ed, in his &s;uper-abounding grace, equally to comprehend them all in the go&s;pel-procla|mation of mercy. But then, which &s;hould be heed|fully minded, not any of them &s;hall obtain this mercy, till they are wro't upon to become believers in Je&s;us Chri&s;t. A "conviction of guilt" is therefore urged, not as tho' it would make &s;inners the "worthy" ob|jects of the divine favor; but as it prepares their minds for that faith, without which they cannot be admitted to mercy. It's office wholly relates to the introducti|on on of faith, and mu&s;t therefore be determined to be u&s;eful, or u&s;ele&s;s, as it either has, or has not, a ten|dency towards the obtainment of it. And is an a|wakened &s;en&s;ibility of mind of no u&s;e, of not the lea&s;t &s;ervice, in order to faith? Is the &s;tupidly tho'tle&s;s and &s;ecure &s;inner under as great advantage to become a believer to life, as he that pre&s;&s;ingly feels his need of relief, and is therefrom excited to an earne&s;t care in inquiring, where, and how, he may find it? Is the hardened profligate, who &s;coffs at God, and every thing &s;erious and &s;acred, in as fair a way to come to the &s;aving knowledge of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as he that &s;o &s;ees and feels his need of this knowledge as to "cry after it", and "&s;eek for it as for hid trea&s;ure, watch|ing daily at wi&s;dom's gates, and waiting at the po&s;ts of her door"? One would think, there could be no room for debate in &s;o plain a point as this. The &s;crip|ture certainly &s;peaks of &s;inners, as being in a "better", or "wor&s;e" &s;tate of mind for the reception of faith; yea, it very evidently in&s;inuates, that they may &s;o harden them&s;elves in perver&s;e ob&s;tinacy, as to be be|yond any probable pro&s;pect of becoming the &s;ubjects of it. See pag. 235, to 242. I &s;hall illu&s;trate what has been above offered, in the following manner. A malefactor that goes to the gallows deeply &s;en&s;ible of his folly, and awaken'd therefrom to humble ardent &s;upplications for mercy, may not, upon this account, "de&s;erve" a pardon, or demand it as his right in point of "ju&s;tice" or "equity", any more than his com|panion that goes with him to the &s;ame puni&s;hment, for the &s;ame crime, in an unconcerned, light and merry frame of mind. But, had the earthly &s;overeign, in who&s;e power it was to grant a pardon, contrived and publi&s;hed a method, thro' the mediation of his own &s;on, conformably to which h&eacute; <HI>might,</HI> with honor and ju&s;tice to his government, &s;hew mercy to <HI>any criminal,</HI> in this &s;tate of condemnation; and <HI>certainly would to all,</HI> who &s;o believed in his mercy as, in the exerci&s;e of true penitence, to apply to him for it?&mdash;In this ca&s;e, the deeply concerned, and ardently &s;upplicating malefactor would act a wi&s;e and proper part; while the tho'tle&s;s, vain and jovial one would de&s;erve, could it be done, to be executed a &s;econd time for the ba&s;e|ne&s;s of his ingratitude, in reflecting &s;uch contempt upon that mercy of his &s;overeign, which would have &s;aved him, had it not been for his own &s;tupid folly. Tis ob&s;ervable, the &s;tory of the two malefactors, who were crucified with our Savior, exhibits a ca&s;e not unlike this I have put. It very &s;trikingly points out the difference our Lord made between "a carele&s;s and convicted &s;inner". Were both the&s;e criminals in the like hardened and in&s;en&s;ible &s;tate of mind? Tis as certain they were not, as words can make it. Of one of them tis &s;aid, that he "rebuked the other" for his prophane mockery of our Lord; that he expre&s;&s;ed a becoming &s;en&s;e of the heinous crime for which he was now &s;uffering; and that he acknowledged the ju&s;tice of his condemnation, profe&s;&s;ing that he therein received no more than "the due reward of his deeds": Be&s;ides all which, he was &s;o tho'tful of futurity, &s;o deeply concerned about what might follow upon the death of his body, and had &s;o much faith in Chri&s;t, as an almighty Savior, from what he had heard of him, as importunately to pray to him in tho&s;e moving words, "Lord, remember me when thou come&s;t into thy kingdom". Upon which, "Je&s;us &s;aid to him, verily I &s;ay unto thee, to day &s;halt thou be with me in paradi&s;e", Luk. 23. from the 39th to 44th ver. Had this malefactor, while hanging on the cro&s;s, been equally &s;tupid with his companion as to any &s;en&s;e of &s;in, or danger after death; and had he equally &s;ignified it by his &s;peech or behavior, reviling our Lord, in&s;tead of making application to him for &s;pi|ritual and eternal mercy, will any one &s;ay, he would have &s;hewed it to him? Tis evident, from the whole run of the &s;tory, that he was in a &s;erious, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, awakened &s;tate of mind. In "this frame of mind" he applied for mercy, and in "this way" he obtained it; while his unconcerned, in&s;en&s;ible and un&s;eeking companion was left to peri&s;h in his &s;ins. And this, I believe, is commonly the ca&s;e. In&s;en&s;ible, &s;ecure &s;inners &s;el|dom receive the "&s;aving truth", till they are previ|ou&s;ly awakened to &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of their need of it, as importunately to &s;eek to God for it.</NOTE> A &s;erious tho't this, and well worthy of our &s;erious con&s;ideration.</P>

<P><PB N="273" REF="009925_0278_0F7B38CDA06F0638">THE reply is obvious; If any &s;hould be &s;o un|advi&s;ed, as to put &s;inners upon exerting them&s;elves, in any way whatever, in order to atone for their guilt, or do that which was effected 1700 years ago, by the work of Chri&s;t fini&s;hed on the cro&s;s, they would, without all doubt, put them upon "e&s;tabli&s;hing a righteou&s;ne&s;s of their own", in oppo&s;ition to "the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God by faith". But this can, with no face of truth, or ju&s;tice, be charged upon tho&s;e endeavours, we have been recommending. Far from placing them in the room of Chri&s;t, we ground all the hope of &s;inners upon the perfection of his obedience, compleat|ed by his humiliation to death. We freely al|low, that their be&s;t doings are of no value, "as a righteou&s;ne&s;s" that will &s;upply the place of grace and Chri&s;t. They &s;uppo&s;e an atonement already made without them; and that, in con|&s;equence of it, God may &s;hew mercy to &s;inners, notwith&s;tanding the greate&s;t unworthine&s;s.

<PB N="274" REF="009925_0279_0F7B38CE720ECDD8">
it is in concurrence with &s;uch endeavours, that God "ordinarily" operates to form that character, without which none can, in con&s;i&s;tency with the go&s;pel, receive &s;aving advantage from the obe|dience and blood of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>MEN may, it is true, thro' ignorance and pride, expect that from their own endeavours, which they ought to expect, and can rea&s;onably expect, only from the doings and &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t. And this may be a fault too common, in a le&s;s or greater degree, among &s;aints as well as &s;in|ners, that is, tho&s;e who have &s;aving faith, as well as tho&s;e who have it not. All indeed are chargeable with it, who expect acceptance with God, in the virtue of any righteou&s;ne&s;s of their's, in&s;tead of the perfect work of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Such righteou&s;ne&s;s may properly be called "their own", as it is of "their own devi&s;ing", and not of God's appointing; and it will reflect di&s;honor on Chri&s;t, as con&s;tructively rendering his death a vain thing. But &s;hall men &s;et &s;till, and do nothing, becau&s;e they may ignorantly, or proud|ly, expect too much from what they do? They ought rather to be put upon their guard, and taught, how they may exert them&s;elves, and, at the &s;ame time, give due honor to Chri&s;t, by placing a ju&s;t dependance on what he has done. The &s;hort of the matter is, if God has required the endeavours of &s;inners, and "ordinarily" be|&s;tows his grace in the u&s;e of them, we may be &s;ure they may be &s;o u&s;ed, as not to be incon&s;i&s;t|ent with the doings of Chri&s;t. And to &s;ay, that they cannot, is, in reality of con&s;truction, to
<PB N="275" REF="009925_0280_0F7B38CF0010A1D0">
make our&s;elves wi&s;er than God; for he would never have required the&s;e endeavours, nor would he have ble&s;&s;ed them with the concurring influ|ences of his Spirit, if they had thrown contempt on Chri&s;t, and were incapable of being u&s;ed, but to the &s;ubver&s;ion of his work fini&s;hed on the cro&s;s.</P>
<P>WHAT remains then, as the conclu&s;ion of all, but that tho&s;e, who are de&s;titute of the faith that is ju&s;tifying, exert them&s;elves in the u&s;e of all proper means, that they may become the &s;ubjects of this grace.

And &s;hould this be the ca&s;e, who could you blame but your&s;elves? Your mouths would be &s;topt; you would not be able to &s;ay a word, unle&s;s to ju&s;tifie God, and con|demn your&s;elves.</P>
<P>YOU will certainly be chargeable with folly, the madne&s;s of folly, if you are thot'le&s;s and unconcerned, in this affair of infinite and ever|la&s;ting importance.

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>I HAVE cho&s;en this text, to take occa&s;ion from it, to di&s;cour&s;e to you upon that "illu|mination of the Spirit", without which we cannot be the &s;ubjects of the "faith by which the ju&s;t do live".</P>
<P>AND it may, perhaps, be of &s;ervice, in order to our conceiving ju&s;tly of its nature, to attend a while to the manner in which the apo&s;tle Paul expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf, with reference to it, in the text; "the eyes of your under&s;tanding being enlight|ened". The like figurative mode of &s;peech is
<PB N="278" REF="009925_0283_0F7B38D2CC025740">
frequently u&s;ed el&s;ewhere in &s;cripture. Says the in&s;pired David, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. 19.8.</NOTE> "the commandment of the Lord is pure,&mdash;enlightening the eyes". Says the evangelical prophet, de&s;cribing the office of Chri&s;t, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. 42.6, 7.</NOTE> "He is given a light to the Gentiles, to open the blind eyes". By "the blind eyes", he means preci&s;ely the &s;ame thing with what is called, in the new-te&s;tament, "the blind mind"; and the per&s;ons he would point out are tho&s;e, who&s;e character is that, <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eph. 4.19.</NOTE> "alienated from the life of God, thro' the ignorance that is in them, becau&s;e of the blindne&s;s of their hearts". The apo&s;tle Paul, in like language, &s;peaks of him&s;elf as "&s;ent to the Gentiles, to open their eyes" the eyes of their under&s;tanding, "and to turn them from darkne&s;s to light". <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Acts 26.18.</NOTE></P>
<P>TIS ob&s;ervable, in all the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, that "faculty of the &s;oul", by which we di&s;cern truth, is likened to the "bodily eye", by the help of which we di&s;cern the objects of &s;ight. And there is, in &s;ome &s;triking re&s;pects, an analogy between the bodily, and mental, faculty of &s;eeing. And tis in virtue of this analogy, that &s;eeing is &s;o commonly apply'd to the mind; and that we &s;o frequently read, and hear, of "the eyes of the under&s;tanding", as well as of the body.</P>
<P>I SHALL endeavour, not only to point out to you this analogy, but &s;o to do it as, at the &s;ame time, to illu&s;trate the doctrine of "divine illumi|nation"; the thing I principally have in view.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="279" REF="009925_0284_0F7B38D3AB567F68">1. IN the fir&s;t place, In order to men's being capable of &s;eeing, they mu&s;t be endow'd with tho&s;e bodily organs, which are naturally fited to the purpo&s;e. If they are de&s;titute of the&s;e; were born without them, or have &s;ince been deprived of them, it is impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould &s;ee. Their condition is &s;uch, that none of the objects of &s;ight can be perceived by them. Darkne&s;s and light are to them the &s;ame thing: They have no faculty by which they can di&s;cern the differ|ence between them. And if they were always without this faculty, they have no idea at all of light, or colours: Nor can it be communicated to them, conformably to the e&s;tabli&s;ht order of nature. They are incapable of &s;uch communi|cation, unle&s;s by a miraculous exertment of the power of the God of nature.</P>
<P>AND thus it is with re&s;pect to "mental &s;ight". The under&s;tanding is the &s;ame thing in relation to truth, that the bodily eye is with regard to the objects of &s;ight. If therefore men are not endow'd with an intellectual faculty, they can have no perception of truth of any &s;ort or kind. Their minds will be in as total darkne&s;s, as their bodies are when they have no eyes. No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> can the idea of truth, while they are de&s;titute of the under&s;tanding-faculty, be conveyed to them, any more than the idea of light to tho&s;e that never had the organs of &s;ight.</P>
<P>IN con&s;equence of this analogy between bodily and mental &s;ight, it may naturally be enquired, whether, in the work of "illumination", God creates the faculty by which men are made to
<PB N="280" REF="009925_0285_0F7B38D44EA7B968">
&s;ee, or effects a moral change only in the intel|lectual faculty they are already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of?</P>
<P>I SHOULD not have tho't, that there was any room for &s;uch an inquiry, had it not been for what &s;ome have &s;aid, it may be unwarily upon this &s;ubject. It &s;hould &s;eem pa&s;t all rea&s;onable di&s;pute, that, in enlightening men's minds, God con&s;iders them, and deals with them, as intelli|gent beings. Tis the truth of fact, that they are &s;o. They come into exi&s;tence endow'd with an under&s;tanding-faculty. Some indeed are born ideots, as there are others that are born blind. But for the generality, they are naturally endow'd with an intellectual capacity. Tis true, the entrance of &s;in into the world has greatly hurt this power of the mind; in&s;omuch that, if left to our&s;elves, and our own guidance, we &s;hall "dark|en our hearts" thro' prejudice and lu&s;t. But notwith&s;tanding the original lap&s;e, and all that has been con&s;equent upon it, the intellectual faculty it&s;elf remains in us. We &s;till exi&s;t intel|ligent creatures. There is therefore, in the "work of illumination", no infu&s;ion of any new faculty by the creating power of God. "The almighty in&s;pir'd us with under&s;tanding", the natural capa|city for it, when he gave us a being in the world. Whatever therefore is done, in the affair of illu|mination, is done upon a faculty we are previ|ou&s;ly the &s;ubjects of: Nor is there any change effected, when &s;inners are enlightened by the Spirit of God, but what is of the moral kind Their under&s;tandings may be a&s;&s;i&s;ted, &s;trengthened, enlarged, refined, and greatly alter'd for the bet|ter; but no new faculty is introduced into their
<PB N="281" REF="009925_0286_0F7B38D510D6C698">
nature. The &s;cripture no where &s;ugge&s;ts &s;uch a thing; but always &s;uppo&s;es, on the contrary, that men have under&s;tandings to enlighten; otherwi&s;e they could not be enlightened. There would be no foundation, in their make, for this work to be built upon.</P>
<P>IT will, perhaps, be &s;aid, tho&s;e that are en|lightened "di&s;cern &s;piritually" the things of the Spirit, which the "natural man" is not capable of doing: Nor can it be done, by any, without the introduction of &s;ome new faculty. If by a new faculty is meant, a faculty &s;o changed from what it was, that it may properly be called new in the moral &s;en&s;e, it is readily allowed. But this is a quite different thing from the formation of a ca|pacity, power, or faculty, in the &s;oul, that is phy&s;ically new. Their is no need of any new fa|culty, in this &s;en&s;e The natural one, made mo|rally new, will an&s;wer the end as well. Nothing more indeed is nece&s;&s;ary, in order to a "&s;piritu|al di&s;cerning of the things of the &s;pirit", than an ability to &s;ee them in a light that is new, and different from that in which they are &s;een by the under&s;tanding, con&s;idered in its meer "natural" &s;tate. And what is there in this, but the mind may be capable of, when it comes to be enlighten|ed by the Spirit of God? Tis ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;eable, that he may &s;o help men's under&s;tandings, as that they &s;hall be able to &s;ee the things of God in their true point of light, and &s;o as they never did, or could &s;ee them before.</P>
<P N="2">2. We cannot &s;ee, in the literal &s;en&s;e without light. This is the medium by which vi&s;ible ob|jects
<PB N="282" REF="009925_0287_0F7B38D5C1034700">
are made perceptible. Was the vi&s;ive facul|ty ever &s;o &s;ound and perfect, it would be intire|ly u&s;ele&s;s if there was no light. It is by the in|tervention of the rayes of the &s;un, or &s;ome other luminous body, that impre&s;&s;ions are made on the organs of &s;ight, and tho&s;e &s;en&s;ations cau&s;ed, which none are the capable &s;ubjects of, but tho&s;e who have eyes to &s;ee.</P>
<P>AND &s;omething analagous to this is true, in regard of the under&s;tanding-faculty. Ideas are the &s;ame thing to the intellectual eye, that the rayes of light are to the bodily eye. Were we void of ideas, we &s;hould be in total, mental darkne&s;s, and incapable of &s;eeing with the eye of the under&s;tanding, tho' it were ever &s;o bright and clear. There might, in this ca&s;e, be the faculty of intellectual &s;ight, but we &s;hould not be able to u&s;e it. It would be of no manner of &s;ervice: We might as well be without it.</P>
<P>THE "God of nature" has therefore, not only implanted in us an intellectual faculty, but taken care to provide for the introduction of ideas into our minds, that it might be u&s;eful to us. Im|pre&s;&s;ions from the material world, by the inter|vention of a variety of bodily organs, &s;uitably adapted to the purpo&s;e, affect the &s;oul, and, in time, conformably to a &s;ettled cour&s;e of nature, &s;tore it with ideas; which ideas, together with the perceptions we have of the operations of our mental powers, &s;erve as a light to our under|&s;tanding-faculty: And it is by this light, that we become capable of &s;eeing with it, that is, of perceiving tho&s;e innumerable "natural truths" that are the objects of this faculty.</P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="009925_0288_0F7B38D6C04872E0">BUT, be&s;ides this natural light, to come nearer to our point, the God of grace, that men's minds might be &s;uitably enlightened, has &s;uperadded the light of revelation; which light he intended, &s;hould be of like u&s;e to the eyes of their under|&s;tandings, with re&s;pect to the great things per|taining to &s;alvation, that the natural light is to the bodily eye, in regard of the common affairs of life. We are frequently led, by the &s;acred writers, to conceive thus of the matter. Says, the man after God's own heart, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. 19.8.</NOTE> "the command|ment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes". And again <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. 119.105.</NOTE> "thy word is a lamp to my feet, and a light to my path". To the like purpo&s;e are tho&s;e words of Solomon, <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Prov. 6.23.</NOTE> "the command|ment is a lamp, and the law is light". And Chri&s;t, Who&s;e character is that, "the &s;un of righ|teou&s;ne&s;s", is repre&s;ented to be of the &s;ame u&s;e to the intellectual &s;ight of men, that the &s;un in the heavens is to the bodily &s;ight. Hence he is &s;aid to have "come a light into the world". <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">John 8.12.</NOTE> Hence he is called "a light to lighten the Gentiles" <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Luk. 2.32.</NOTE> And hence the de&s;ign of his coming is &s;poken of in &s;uch language that, "to give light to them that &s;it in darkne&s;s, and in the &s;hadow of death". <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luk. 1.79.</NOTE> And the light he has given the world, in the revelations of &s;cripture, is that alone, by which we are let into the knowlege of the go&s;pel method of "redemption thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t". It lay "hid in God", till he was plea&s;ed "&s;upernaturally" to open the everla&s;ting de&s;igns of his grace to a peri&s;hing world. This he did to Adam, and Abraham, in a general &s;ummary
<PB N="284" REF="009925_0289_0F7B38D768286158">
way; and to the jewi&s;h nation, under the cover of types, figures and prophetic repre&s;entations; but never in a di&s;tinct and explicit manner, till the times of Chri&s;t, who came from the father, knew his mind, re&s;pecting the great affair of man's &s;alvation, and plainly declared it to the world.</P>
<P>TIS ob&s;ervable, the natural light, without which a being on the earth would be &s;carce de|&s;ireable, is the &s;ole contrivance, and effect, of the infinite wi&s;dom, power and goodne&s;s of God. He CREATED it. And he is, in like manner, the CREATOR of that light, which &s;hews men the way of &s;alvation thro' a redeemer. It came down &s;uper-naturally from above: Nor could we have had any idea of the truths it di&s;covers, had they not, in this way, been revealed to us. This re|vealed light is therefore the &s;ame thing, in the "new-creation", that the natural light is in the "old". And we are ab&s;olutely beholden to God for it. There is nothing of man in it, no will of his, not &s;o much as a wi&s;h, or tho't of his heart. Tis intirely the gift of heaven. And tis in this &s;en&s;e, with great propriety, that God is &s;aid to "enlighten our under&s;tandings"; for they have no light, nor was it po&s;&s;ible they &s;hould have any, with reference to the go&s;pel-plan of &s;alvation, but what God has been plea&s;ed freely to give them; and this, in a way preventive of any en|deavours of their's to procure this gift.</P>
<P>I SHALL not think it a digre&s;&s;ion to &s;ubjoin here, the bodily eye, and vi&s;ible objects, are &s;o fited to each other, by the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of God, as that plea&s;ure is connected with the ap|plication
<PB N="285" REF="009925_0290_0F7B38D802537580">
of the latter to the former. Not but that the impre&s;&s;ions made on the organs of &s;ight, by external objects, are &s;ometimes the occa&s;ion of unea&s;ine&s;s. It was de&s;igned they &s;hould be &s;o. And many wi&s;e and valuable ends are an&s;wered hereby. But &s;till, plea&s;ure is ordinarily con|joined with &s;eeing, according to that ob&s;ervation of the wi&s;e man, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eccle&s;. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">.7.</NOTE> "the light is &s;weet, and a plea&s;ant thing it is for the eye to behold the &s;un". And this is as true of the eye of the under&s;tanding, as of the body. The perception of truth is accom|panied with plea&s;ure, unle&s;s in tho&s;e in&s;tances wherein it is intended to excite aver&s;ion, and give anxiety. There is &s;uch a proportion, congruity, agreement, or whatever el&s;e any may plea&s;e to call it, between the intellectual faculty, and the objects that are fited to give it delight, that this, by an e&s;tabli&s;ht uniform cour&s;e of nature, is the re&s;ult of their meeting together. It not only perceives the&s;e objects, but perceives al&s;o, at the &s;ame time, a &s;weetne&s;s, beauty and excellency in them, greater or le&s;s, according to the nature of the object perceived, and the degree in which it is perceived. There are no intellectual objects, in them&s;elves beautiful and excellent, but the under&s;tanding is formed with a capacity, origi|nally greater in &s;ome, and le&s;s in others, to per|ceive the beauty and excellency there is in them, as truly as to perceive the objects them&s;elves: Nor has this capacity been de&s;troyed by &s;in, any more than the intellectual faculty it&s;elf. And it is, perhaps, impo&s;&s;ible it &s;hould be de&s;troyed, but by the de&s;truction of the faculty by which we perceive at all. Tis accordingly the truth of fact,
<PB N="286" REF="009925_0291_0F7B38D984002F68">
that men, who, by their per&s;onal folly, have awfully corrupted their under&s;tandings, and moral ta&s;te too, are yet capable of &s;eeing, and feeling, a beauty and glory in characters that are the re|ver&s;e of their own. When placed before their view, in a &s;trong point of light, they command their approbation; they can't but own their per|ception of an amiable glory in them;&mdash;tho', at the &s;ame time, they are a&s;hamed, they are not them&s;elves the &s;ubjects of this glory.</P>
<P>WHAT I aim at, in this additional tho't, is to &s;how, that, in the work of illumination, there is no "phy&s;ically new &s;en&s;e" implanted in the &s;in|ner, any more than a phy&s;ically new intellectual-faculty. If he had no intellectual capacity, it would be, not "morally" only, but "naturally", impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould under&s;tand; and it would be equally, and in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e, impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould perceive a beauty and excellency in any object of the mind, if he had no capacity in his nature for this perception. The idea of this beauty could not, in this ca&s;e, be communicated to him. A phy&s;ically new capacity mu&s;t be put into him, in order to it; that is to &s;ay, he mu&s;t be made a phy&s;ically different being from what he was, and from what others of his &s;pecies are. But the bible no where gives us rea&s;on to expect the implantation of any &s;uch new capacity: Nor in|deed is there any need of it. The moral change that is made in the under&s;tanding, by the illumi|nations of the Spirit of God, will, at the &s;ame time, introduce a proportionable ta&s;te, reli&s;h, or favour of divine and &s;piritual objects. This ta&s;te may be, and actually is, wanting in vitiated and
<PB N="287" REF="009925_0292_0F7B38DA4014A910">
corrupted minds; and &s;o is the ju&s;t perception of revealed truth al&s;o: And they bear an exact propor|tion to each other. But if the under&s;tanding is en|lightened in the things of the Spirit, a ta&s;te for them will be a natural concomitant. When the mind is illuminated, &s;o as to perceive revealed objects in their true point of light, it will perceive al&s;o a beauty and glory in them. The&s;e perceptions are, as I imagine, in&s;eperable from each other. The con&s;titution of man is &s;uch, that he can't &s;ee the truth as it is Je&s;us, and not perceive, at the &s;ame time, the excelling glory and importance of it. And if tis the ca&s;e of any, that they have no ta&s;te for &s;piritual and divine things, perceive no favour in them, it may with certainty be con|cluded, they have never been enlightened by the Spirit of God, &s;o as to &s;ee them in their ju&s;t and proper light.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE bodily eye, where there is a &s;ufficiency and clearne&s;s of external light, may yet be di&s;|abled from &s;eeing, at lea&s;t in a di&s;tinct and clear manner, by rea&s;on of natural or contracted weak|ne&s;s or di&s;order. This is no uncommon ca&s;e; tho' an unhappy one: Nor can it be remedied, but by a removal of the cau&s;e of it. Till this is done, the eye will not &s;ee clearly, tho' the rayes of the &s;un &s;hould be reflected from external objects with ever &s;o bright a lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>AND the &s;ame is true, with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;pect to the eye of the mind. Such is its weak and di&s;ordered &s;tate, &s;ince the introduction of &s;in into the world, that its &s;ight is ob&s;cured, in a le&s;s or greater de|gree, in regard of all mankind. There is no

man but has upon his mind &s;ome wrong bia&s;s or other, which is a like impediment to the eye of the under&s;tanding, that a film is to the eye of the body. We may be not &s;ufficiently aware of it, but tis a real truth, that prejudice, partiality, pa&s;&s;ion, pride, &s;en&s;ual and other lu&s;ts, are, as it were&punc; the cataracts of the mind; and, in proportion to their growth, will cloud its &s;ight; yea, they may prevail to &s;uch a degree of &s;trength as, in a great mea&s;ure, to put out the eyes of the under&s;tanding. And this in|deed has, in all ages, been the real truth of fact.</P>
<P>THE heathen world have ever &s;o poorly under|&s;tood, even, what they might have known of God, that they have all along lived in ignorance of him; nay, what is much wor&s;e, they have &s;o corrupted their under&s;tanding, that, in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ead of being their guide, it has proved their &s;educer; and in &s;o gro&s;s &s;en&s;e, that there are no ab&s;urdities in &s;peculation, nor abominations in practice, but they have been led into them. As the apo&s;tle &s;peaks, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. 1.25.</NOTE> "profe&s;&s;ing them&s;elves wi&s;e, they became fools; changing the truth of God into a lie, and &s;erving the creature more than the Creator, who is ble&s;&s;ed forever." Hence tho&s;e numerous pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, in which they are repre&s;ent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s having "darkened their hearts", and "blinded their minds"; yea, and as having done this to &s;o great a degree, as that they "could not &s;ee", tho' they had intel|lectual eyes for this purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>NOR is this blindne&s;s peculiar to the heathen world. Tis common to all the &s;ons of Adam, in a le&s;s or greater degree. Even the chri&s;tian world,
<PB N="289" REF="009925_0294_0F7B38DDDA283290">
who are favored with the light of the glorious Go&s;|pel, have &s;o blinded their minds as to grope in the dark, as it were, at noon day; admiting, for truths of God, the gro&s;&s;e&s;t ab&s;urdities. For &s;uch are &s;ome of the doctrines taught, and received, in the church of Rome; as the wor&s;hip of God by images; the u&s;e of living and dead &s;aints as mediators with hea|ven, particularly the Virgin Mary, who has far more re&s;pect paid her than even Chri&s;t him&s;elf; the conver&s;ion of the bread and wine, in the &s;acra|ment, into the real body and blood of Chri&s;t, and the like: Than which, more palpable ab&s;urdities were never introduced into any pagan religion. They are indeed as &s;hocking as were ever received for truths, unle&s;s we &s;hould except tho&s;e doctrines of this &s;ame church, which teach, that &s;he is infal|libly right in e&s;tabli&s;hing the&s;e mon&s;trous errors; and that &s;he takes a rational and chri&s;tian method to gain the a&s;&s;ent of men's minds to them, by in|flicting on them the &s;evere&s;t bodily tortures. The&s;e, it mu&s;t be owned, are &s;uch an affront to the human under&s;tanding, and &s;uch a defiance of common &s;en&s;e, as can &s;carce be matched with a parallel, in any part of the heathen world, however invelop't with darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>NOR can it be &s;aid, even of Prote&s;tants, that they han't betrayed a &s;trange blindne&s;s of mind, in the gro&s;s mi&s;takes which they have embraced for &s;acred truths. It is indeed acknowledged, the light of the reformation opened to their view the enor|mous folly of &s;ome of the popi&s;h tenets; which they have accordingly rejected: But they &s;till, many of them at lea&s;t, receive ab&s;urdities of another kind, and very great ones too. There are numbers,
<PB N="290" REF="009925_0295_0F7B38DE07D61E68">
even in the prote&s;tant world, who have &s;o &s;trangely lo&s;t &s;ight, both of human rea&s;on, and divine reve|lation, as that they are ready to place the &s;ub&s;tance of chri&s;tianity in any thing, rather than in what it ought to be placed. Nay, to &s;uch a degree have &s;ome been blinded, either by the god of this world, or their own vain imaginations, and fooli&s;h pre|judices, as that they have encouraged them&s;elves in a wicked life, even from the very overtures of that in&s;titution, which was purpo&s;ely &s;et on foot to de&s;troy men's lu&s;ts and vices; pretending, that, by their "continuing in &s;in", they &s;hould give occa&s;ion for the "greater illu&s;tration of the mercy of God" in their forgivene&s;s. Amazing infatuation! Their "fooli&s;h hearts" mu&s;t be extremely "darkened", or tis not po&s;&s;ible, they &s;hould have been led away by &s;o &s;en&s;ele&s;s a delu&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE eyes of men's under&s;tanding being thus di&s;ordered, the illuminating work of God's Spirit is de&s;igned for their help. And more a great deal is included in it, than meerly his giving them the ex|ternal light of revelation. This light, tis true, is nece&s;&s;ary. We can, in no other way, have an idea of God as "reconcilable to the world", and as "reconciling the world to him&s;elf by Je&s;us Chri&s;t". But tis, at the &s;ame time, true likewi&s;e, that we may enjoy this light, and not perceive the truths it would make manife&s;t, &s;o perceive them as to be &s;av|ingly wro't upon by them. Some &s;ecret powerful influence of the divine Spirit mu&s;t go along with it to effect this. Our "eyes mu&s;t be opened", or we &s;hall no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> "behold wondrous things out of God's law". Tis ob&s;ervable, many truths were "wrote in the law of Mo&s;es, in the Prophets, and in the

P&s;alms concerning Chri&s;t"; but even his di&s;ciples entertained wrong conceptions of them, till he "opened their under&s;tandings to under&s;tand the &s;criptures". <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luk. 24.44, 45.</NOTE> In like manner, "the hope of the chri&s;tian's calling, and the riches of the glory of the inheritance of the &s;aints", are externally revealed in the go&s;pel; but the apo&s;tle Paul knew, notwith|&s;tanding this, that the Ephe&s;ian believers needed to have "the eyes of their under&s;tanding enlightened", in order to their taking in a more clear and ju&s;t idea of the&s;e things. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eph. 1.17, 18.</NOTE> And if tho&s;e, who were believers already, needed further enlightening by the Spirit, in order to a more full pro&s;pect of the "glory of the hope that was &s;et before them", much more are his illuminating influences nece&s;&s;ary for others. The truth is, "the vail that is on the hearts of &s;inners mu&s;t be taken away", or they will never "behold with open face the glory of the Lord", &s;o as to be "changed by it into the &s;ame image from glory to glory"; that is to &s;ay, the impediments to their intellectual &s;ight, occa&s;ioned by the mi&s;ts of &s;in and lu&s;t, mu&s;t, in a good mea|&s;ure, be removed away, or they will be unable to &s;ee revealed truths &s;o as to be morally transformed by them. This calls for help, from the Spirit of God, beyond that which is afforded by the light of revelation, in it&s;elf &s;imply con&s;idered. And it is principally by means of this further help, that that effect is wro't in &s;inners, which is expre&s;&s;ed in the &s;acred writings by their "under&s;tandings being opened", by their being "called out of darkne&s;s", by their being "turned from darkne&s;s to light", and the like.</P>
<P><PB N="292" REF="009925_0297_0F7B38DF8488BC70">THE Spirit of God, as I imagine, ordinarily be|gins this part of his illuminating work, by rou&s;ing the con&s;ciences of &s;inners, and exciting in them an earne&s;t &s;ollicitude to become acquainted with the things that are connected with their everla&s;ting well|being. They were walking, it may be, "in the way of their own heart, and in the &s;ight of their their eyes", tho'tle&s;s of God, and unconcerned a|bout their &s;ouls, and the important affairs of &s;alva|tion. But, by &s;ome a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">arming providence, or &s;ea|&s;onable word of truth, &s;uitably impre&s;&s;ed on their minds by the influence of the Spirit, they are &s;o changed from what they were, as to become &s;eri|ou&s;ly tho'tful; and their tho'ts, in&s;tead of running upon the vanities and gaites of the world, or the gratifications of time and &s;en&s;e, are turned towards the infinitely greater concerns of eternal life. This is the natural effect of an awakened &s;tate of mind; and it &s;trongly tends to check the power of &s;in, and weaken the force of tho&s;e wrong bia&s;&s;es that darken the &s;ight of the mind. It is certainly a well adapted mean to this purpo&s;e; as truly &s;o as external ap|plications are to the bodily eye, to take off a film that hinde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> it from &s;eeing. A &s;en&s;e of &s;in and guilt is ever accompanied, more or le&s;s, with di&s;tre&s;&s;ing anxiety. This naturally puts the &s;inner upon looking out for help; and upon doing it, in a &s;ober, &s;erious and earne&s;t manner. Per&s;ons under awakenings by the Spirit of God, e&s;pecially if they are &s;trong, and of any long continuance, are always tho'tful, and religiou&s;ly &s;o: And they are, for this rea&s;on, from the very make of the human &s;oul, in a better di&s;po&s;ition, in a fiter temper, to be guided by the Spirit into the knowledge of the truth, as it is in Je&s;us, than when they were going on in their
<PB N="293" REF="009925_0298_0F7B38E0947B7438">
&s;ins, unconcerned about the affairs of religion and another world. Their minds are now, in a mea|&s;ure, prepared for tho&s;e higher illuminations of the Spirit, which we &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;peak of under the next head of analogy, to which I proceed.</P>
<P N="4">4. THE bodily eye is not able fully to take in, what vi&s;ible objects are fited to communicate, by a &s;udden tran&s;ient glance only. It mu&s;t be fixed on them, and view them with care and attention; or many things, both u&s;eful and important, will e&s;cape their notice, which yet they might have perceived, upon a more exact and clo&s;e examination of them.</P>
<P>AND the &s;ame is equally true, if not much more &s;o, in re&s;pect of the eye of the mind. It can't per|ceive truth, unle&s;s in a few &s;elf-evident in&s;tances, and not even in the&s;e at fir&s;t, by a &s;ingle ca&s;t of its di&s;cerning power. It mu&s;t view it with care, deliberation and attention; otherwi&s;e it will not &s;ee it: To be &s;ure, not &s;o as to be in any con&s;iderable mea&s;ure, impre&s;&s;ed and influenced by it. And to the want of this care and attention it is very much owing, that &s;o many truths are either wholly un|di&s;cerned by multitudes, or di&s;cerned only in an imperfect, partial and confu&s;ed manner. E&s;pecially is this the ca&s;e, in regard of religious truths; tho&s;e, I mean, which are not perceivable, but by the light of revelation. This light does not tran&s;mit, to tho&s;e who are favored with it, a conception of the truths, it would declare, either as to their evidence, mean|ing, u&s;efulne&s;s, or importance, whether they attend to them, or not. Tis indeed fited to convey into the mind this perception; and &s;o as to renew and transform it: But it does this in the u&s;e of con|&s;ideration
<PB N="294" REF="009925_0299_0F7B3BFE404DBE58">
and attention. Tis accordingly ob&s;erve|able, "the word" as "able to &s;ave the &s;oul", is &s;poken of as "an ingrafted word". How does the cyon turn the &s;ap of a &s;tock into its own nature, and cau&s;e it to bring forth good fruit, but by being fa&s;tened upon it, and let into it? "The word" turns the temper of the mind into its own nature, the &s;ame way, in the moral &s;en&s;e, that is, by &s;eri|ous con&s;ideration; which does, as it were, fa&s;ten the word to the mind, let the one into the other, and unite them together. In like manner, it was by this &s;ame con&s;ideration and attention that the "hearers of the word", re&s;embled, in the parable, by "&s;eed &s;owed in good ground, that bro't forth good fruit, and in plenty", are di&s;tingui&s;hed from the other hearers, re&s;embled by "&s;eed that was &s;owed, and came to nothing": Tis &s;aid of them, "having heard the word, they kept it", that is, they retained it in their hearts by &s;erious contemplation, by frequently employing their tho'ts on it; where|in they differed from the other hearers, who, for want of this con&s;ideration, &s;uffered the word to be "&s;natched away from them", or to "wither",
<Q>having nothing to give it "root"; or to be choked with the cares of the pre&s;ent life.</Q>
And the "doer of the word", who &s;hall be "ble&s;&s;ed in his deed", is di&s;tingui&s;hed from the "hearer of it only", by his "looking into the law of liberty; and continuing therein", that is, continuing to look therein. In other words, expre&s;&s;ive of the thing meant, he is one that does not, in a heedle&s;s, cur&s;ory way only, ca&s;t his eye upon the &s;acred books of re|velation, but looks into them with care &amp; attention; and he continues in the u&s;e of this care, "daily &s;earching the &s;criptures", if he may find in them
<PB N="295" REF="009925_0300_0F7B3A61BA1DD2A8">
"the words of eternal life". Hence the advice, "take heed how you hear". <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luk. 8.18.</NOTE> And again, "give the more earne&s;t heed to the things which you have heard, lea&s;t at any time you &s;hould let them &s;lip". <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heb. 2.1.</NOTE> Hence David "tho't on his ways", as a proper means "to turn his feet into the path of God's te&s;timonies". <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. 119.59.</NOTE> And hence al&s;o that &s;olemn prayer of his,<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">1 Cron. 29.18.</NOTE> "O Lord God of Abraham, of I&s;aac, and of I&s;rael, our fathers, keep this for ever in the ima|gination of the tho'ts of the heart of this people, and prepare their heart unto thee".</P>
<P>NOW the Spirit of God, in managing the work of illumination, fixes the tho'ts of &s;inners upon re|vealed objects, and &s;o governs their exerci&s;e, as that divine truths are &s;avingly opened to their view. I ob&s;erved, under the former head, that he ordinarily begins this work by awakening, in the minds of &s;inners, &s;uch a concern about their future ever|la&s;ting well-being, as turns their tho'ts from the things of this world, to the things of God and their &s;oul's &s;alvation. I would now &s;ay, having thus excited in them a di&s;po&s;ition to &s;ober, religious con|&s;ideration, he proceeds in the work, by calling their attention to divine and &s;piritual objects, and holding their tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ts to them, by frequent and clo&s;e contem|plation. So it was that he made David &s;piritually wi&s;er than his enemies. He did this, by keeping divine truths, and his mind together. That is, the account of the matter, "thou, thro' thy com|mandments, ha&s;t made wi&s;er than mine enemies; <HI>for they are ever with me</HI>".<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. 119.98.</NOTE> So he "opened the heart of Lydia, that &s;he attended to the things which

were &s;poken of Paul". <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts. 16.14.</NOTE> She "held her mind to them", kept it &s;taid upon them by clo&s;e con&s;idera|tion. And this &s;he did, as influenced hereto by the Spirit of God. He "opened her heart", &s;o as that &s;he "thus attended". And, in like manner, he opens the hearts of others, by his &s;ecret and pow|erful influences, to think of the great concerns of their &s;ouls and eternity, and to think of them with an attention &s;o earne&s;t and engaged, as that other tho'ts are excluded, at lea&s;t the force of them re|&s;trained within proper bounds and limits. They might before this have tho't of the great truths of re|ligion and &s;alvation, but their tho'ts of this kind were &s;udden in their ri&s;e, and &s;hort in their continuance. They were &s;oon "choked with the cares, or riches, or plea&s;ures of this life". But they have now a &s;ettled abode in them. They "meditate on them both in the day, and in the night". They are the princi|pal objects that employ their &s;erious con&s;ideration. And tis ordinarily in concurrence with this awaken'd, and engaged attention, that the divine Spirit "&s;hines into their hearts", &s;o as to "give them the light of the glory of God, in the face of Je&s;us Chri&s;t". Having excited in them a &s;erious, con&s;iderate di&s;po|&s;ition, he turns their tho'ts to the great doctrines of &s;alvation, a&s;&s;i&s;ts, &s;uperintends and conducts the ex|erci&s;e of them, and in this way opens their under|&s;tandings &s;o as to di&s;cover to them the truths of revelation in their divinity, reality, excellency, u&s;efulne&s;s and nece&s;&s;ity. And now it is, that they &s;ee divine objects in a different light from what they did before. They have now &s;uch a &s;ight of God, as that they love him with their whole &s;ouls, and are di&s;po&s;ed to make him the &s;upreme object of their
<PB N="297" REF="009925_0302_0F7B3C00CA3A9378">
hope, tru&s;t and confidence. They have now &s;uch a &s;ight of Chri&s;t, as one "able to &s;ave even to the uttermo&s;t, all that come to God by him", that they can readily venture their eternal concerns in his hands. They have now &s;uch a &s;ight of &s;in, in its odious nature, as well as ruinous tendency, as that they find within them&s;elves a heart to hate it, and to abhor them&s;elves for ever having had any love to it. They have now &s;uch a &s;ight of holine&s;s, in the excellency of its nature, as well as the u&s;efulne&s;s of its tendency, that they more heartily de&s;ire nothing, than that they may "be holy even as God is holy". In a word, they have now &s;uch a &s;ight of the wi&s;|dom, the holine&s;s, the righteou&s;ne&s;s and mercy of the go&s;pel &s;cheme of "redemption, thro' the blood of Chri&s;t", that they can intirely acquie&s;ce in it; neither expecting, nor de&s;iring to be &s;aved in any other way. They "count all things but lo&s;s for the excellency of the knowledge" they now have "of Chri&s;t Je&s;us their Lord".</P>
<P N="5">5. I HAVE yet to &s;ay, in the fifth and la&s;t place, the bodily eye may be &s;o circum&s;tanced, as to be incapable of &s;eeing di&s;tinctly and clearly, but by the intervention of foreign help. A common ca&s;e this. There are multitudes, e&s;pecially among tho&s;e in years, who&s;e eyes are in &s;uch a &s;tate, as that the objects of &s;ight appear as thro' a mi&s;t; and they &s;ee them in an indi&s;tinct, and confu&s;ed manner only: But, by the help of proper gla&s;&s;es, the rayes of light are &s;o collected, and thrown upon the eye, as that this ob&s;curity is taken away, and they are enabled to &s;ee with clearne&s;s and preci&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="009925_0303_0F7B3C017B6BA798">AND thus it is, in a great mea&s;ure, with the eye of the mind. It may not be able to di&s;cern truth, in a thou&s;and in&s;tances, with clearne&s;s and certainty, till, by foreign aid, it is placed before their view in a &s;pecial point of light. They can now readily perceive it to be truth, and &s;o per|ceive it too, as to feel the beauty and excellency of it; and the light may break in upon them with &s;o bright a lu&s;tre, as to occa&s;ion even their wonder, that they could not di&s;cern it before.</P>
<P>AND, perhaps, this is eminently one of the ways, in which the Spirit of God opens the eyes of men's under&s;tandings to &s;ee the truths of reve|lation, in their certainty, &s;weetne&s;s and infinite importance. He may &s;o &s;uperintend and govern the exerci&s;e of their tho'ts with reference to them; their ideas, under his guidance, may be &s;et in &s;uch order, and placed in &s;uch an ea&s;ie relation to each other, as that the mind &s;hall &s;ee things in a point of light it never did before, and never would, or could, have done, had it not been for this inter|vening help. By giving their tho'ts this &s;pecial direction, and connection, they may have the mo&s;t lively &s;ight of that, they could not di&s;cern before, or &s;aw only, as it were, in the dark, in a partial, indi&s;tinct and confu&s;ed manner. And let it not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">em &s;trange to any, that the Spirit of God &s;hould, in this way, &s;hine into men's hearts, "calling them out of darkne&s;s into marvellous light". He has in&s;pired &s;ome, even among the &s;ons of men, with &s;uch dexterity and &s;kill, that, by put|ting together, and placing in a proper point of light, the ideas that con&s;titute the&s;e and tho&s;e natural truths, they can ea&s;ily convey a percep|tion
<PB N="299" REF="009925_0304_0F7B3C0207E09618">
of them to others, and in ca&s;es too, in which, perhaps, they would never have had this percep|tion, had they been left to them&s;elves, and been the &s;ole guides of their own tho'ts. And &s;hall not the Spirit him&s;elf have an ability &s;o to place revealed objects before the view of men, as that they &s;hall be able to &s;ee them &s;o as they never did, or could, before? He mo&s;t certainly has this ability. And tho' he may, in the work of illumination, &s;o mix the exertments of it, with the actings of men's own faculties, as that they can't ea&s;ily, if at all, di&s;tingui&s;h the one from the other; yet, it is doubtle&s;s principally owing to this intervening influence of his, that they are enabled to &s;ee "&s;piritually" the things, he has "externally" revealed in the &s;acred books of &s;cripture.</P>
<P>THE influences of the Spirit, in helping men to this new and &s;piritual &s;ight of the things per|taining to &s;alvation, are &s;ometimes di&s;pen&s;ed in &s;uch a mea&s;ure, as that light breaks in upon their minds &s;uddenly and perceptibly; in&s;omuch that they are able to &s;ay, at &s;uch a time, "the eyes of my under&s;tanding were opened", I had then &s;uch a &s;ight of God, of Chri&s;t, of my &s;elf, and of the go&s;pel-way of &s;alvation, as gives me rea&s;on a&s;&s;ur|edly to think, the life of grace was now effectual|ly begun in me. But commonly the work of illumination is carried on, in a more gradual and le&s;s perceptible way. The &s;ubjects of it can only &s;ay in general, "whereas I was once blind, I now &s;ee". Their light, like the "morning dawn", gradually and indi&s;cernably "&s;hines more and more" till it increa&s;es "to perfect day".</P>
<P><PB N="300" REF="009925_0305_0F7B3C02D40FAA78">SOME, perhaps, may be di&s;po&s;ed to think, if not to &s;peak, contemptuou&s;ly of this influence of the Spirit, by which men's under&s;tandings are opened to &s;ee divine truths in a new and different light, becau&s;e tis, to them, inconceivable how he &s;hould operate on them, &s;o as to give them this perception. But the inconceivablene&s;s of the thing is no ju&s;t objection again&s;t the truth of it. Do tho&s;e who move this difficulty know, how the objects of bodily &s;ight affect the &s;oul, by intro|ducing into it tho&s;e &s;en&s;ations we have certain experience of? Can they de&s;cribe the modus of their operation, pointing out the way in which impre&s;&s;ions on the vi&s;ive organs convey percep|tions into the mind? Till they find them&s;elves able to do this, they can't, with any face of mode&s;ty or rea&s;on, object again&s;t the influence of God's Spirit upon the under&s;tandings of men, be|cau&s;e the manner of it may be &s;ecreted from us. Tis indeed an objection of no more weight again&s;t the Spirit's acting upon the minds of men, that we know not how he does it, than tis again&s;t the actings of external objects upon them by the in|tervention of the &s;en&s;es, that we are ignorant how this is done. The one is as ea&s;ie to conceive of as the other; or rather, they are both equally beyond human comprehen&s;ion. Nor is it at all incredible, that the God that made our &s;ouls, and is therefore intimately, and perfectly acquainted with them, and all the avenues into them, &s;hould be able to influence them in ways we are not formed with capacities to inve&s;tigate. It would be highly unrea&s;onable, I might &s;ay, gro&s;ly ab|&s;urd, to &s;uppo&s;e, he had not this ability: Tho', he ought always to be con&s;idered as exerting it,

not only in con&s;i&s;tency with the nature of men's faculties, but in concurrence with them, and &s;o as to pre&s;erve and promote, not &s;uper&s;ede, the proper u&s;e and employment of them. And in this way it is, as we have &s;een, that he both be|gins, and carries on, the work of illumination. He awakens men's con&s;ideration; he fixes it on the great things pertaining to &s;alvation, keeping the&s;e and their minds continually together; he directs and a&s;&s;i&s;ts the exerci&s;e of their tho'ts on them; and, in a word, &s;o conducts and governs this whole affair, as that the re&s;ult is, their &s;eeing revealed truths &s;o as to be no longer in the dark, but to become "the children of the day", and "to walk in light": All which is both ea&s;ily in|telligible, and highly rea&s;onable; tho' the modus of the Spirit's influence herein &s;hould be un|known, and not to be de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>A VARIETY of remarks might now ea&s;ily and naturally be deduced, from the preceeding di&s;|cour&s;e, which would further tend <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o illu&s;trate the doctrine of the "Spirit's illuminating work", as well as to correct &s;ome mi&s;taken notions about it; but I mu&s;t confine my&s;elf to two only, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ea&s;t I &s;hould put your patience to too long a tryal.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t is, that the divine Spirit, in enlighten|ing men's minds, lets them into the knowlege of no truths, but tho&s;e that are contained in the &s;acred books of &s;cripture. The&s;e were "wrote by holy men", as "moved and in&s;pired by the holy Gho&s;t"; and they exhibit the whole mind of God, &s;o far as he tho't it needful, or proper, to make a revelation of it. The de&s;ign therefore
<PB N="302" REF="009925_0307_0F7B3C046382A320">
of the Spirit, in his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">minating-work, is not to enlarge the object of faith, by revealing any new truths; but to &s;et tho&s;e that are already revealed in &s;uch a point of light before the minds of men, as that they &s;hall have a ju&s;t, &s;trong and lively perception of them, in their divinity, as well as excellency and importance. That light, which, under the influence of God's Spirit, gives life and vigor to the "new-creation", is "the light of the glory of God", as it is manife&s;ted in the &s;cripture. No other light is nece&s;&s;ary; no other is ever made u&s;e of by the holy Gho&s;t, in "enlightening the eyes of men's under&s;tanding". He conveys into their minds no light, no knowledge, no ideas whatever, but as derived from that old, publick, &s;tanding revelation of God, THE HOLY BIBLE. To &s;uppo&s;e otherwi&s;e would be, in true con&s;equence, to reflect di&s;honor on this &s;acred book, as tho' it did not exhibit the mind of God in all things nece&s;&s;ary, in order to man's &s;alvation. For if, in the work of illumination, new truths were di&s;co|vered, truths the &s;cripture had not before reveal|ed, it would be an incomplete, in&s;ufficient reve|lation; as needing to be &s;upply'd by new in&s;pi|ration from the holy Gho&s;t. It could not there|fore be ju&s;tly &s;aid of it, that it is "profitable", &s;o as that "the man of God might be perfect, throughly furni&s;hed unto all good works"; that it is "able to make men wi&s;e unto &s;alvation"; able to "&s;ave their &s;ouls"; and to "build them up, and give them an inheritance among all them that are &s;anctified"; all which is expre&s;ly affirm|ed of it, as let into men's minds, and actuated when there, by the influence of the Spirit of grace.</P>
<P><PB N="303" REF="009925_0308_0F7B3C04FB5B30C0">IT obviou&s;ly, and nece&s;&s;arily, follows from this remark, that tho&s;e are gro&s;ly deluded, not divine|ly illuminated, who imagine, that the "teachings of the Spirit", under the go&s;pel, are ever afforded to men, either "without" the revealed written word, or in "oppo&s;ition" to it. Would to God it were a fal&s;hood to affirm it of any, that they were thus deluded! But it has been, and now is, too common a ca&s;e in the chri&s;tian world; e&s;peci|ally among tho&s;e, who, under the influence of an over-heated imagination, have been able to &s;ee vi&s;ions; or to hear voices, audibly &s;peaking, or &s;oftly whi&s;pering in their ears; or to feel them|&s;elves &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed with this or that notion, or as &s;trongly impelled to this or that action.

In their own ap|prehen&s;ions, they are above in&s;truction from the oracles of God; as having a more &s;afe and &s;ure guide, even the Spirit of truth, who is their im|mediate director. Tis &s;trange, any &s;hould &s;o gro&s;ly deceive them&s;elves. For nothing is ever &s;ugge&s;ted to, or impre&s;&s;ed on, the minds of men, by the divine Spirit, but in perfect harmony with the revealed truths of &s;cripture: He makes no di&s;coveries of any kind, but from this &s;acred book.

convincing, commanding, &s;triking light, before the eye of the under&s;tanding, as that it may an|&s;wer the great and good purpo&s;es for which it was revealed. The "inward" teaching of the Spirit ought therefore, in no ca&s;e, upon no occa&s;ion, to be "oppo&s;ed" to what is "outwardly" taught in the revelations of &s;cripture. Tis impo&s;&s;ible, as "the &s;cripture was given by in&s;piration of God", that there &s;hould be any di&s;agreement be|tween what he "inwardly" teaches, and what he has cau&s;ed to be "externally" wrote. "What &s;aith the &s;cripture"? ought therefore to be the grand que&s;tion in all &s;uppo&s;ed illuminations, manife&s;tati|ons, &s;ugge&s;tions, and di&s;coveries from the Spirit. If they agree not with this infallible rule, they are not from him; and we may be as &s;ure of it, as that he is the revealer of the truths contained in the bible. There is indeed no delu&s;ion more dangerous than this, of depending upon the teaching, and gui|dance, of the Spirit, "without" the word, or in "oppo&s;ition" to it. Men have now a rule, that &s;uper&s;edes the bible, even the immediate dictates of the Spirit of God; and &s;o are prepared for whatever delu&s;ions a heated imagination, or &s;ub|tle devil, may &s;ugge&s;t to them, under the di&s;|gui&s;e of divine communications; and this, in oppo&s;ition to the cleare&s;t rea&s;on, as well as mo&s;t expre&s;s revelation. How many enthu&s;ia&s;ts, vain|ly conceiting they were extraordinarily illumina|ted by the Spirit, have proceeded from one ab&s;urdity to another, till they have run quite wild!

again&s;t any &s;uppo&s;ed influences, dictates, or mani|fe&s;tations from the Spirit, to the neglect of the &s;cripture, much more in contradiction to it. This has never yet failed of betraying men into folly; and the &s;ame effect may always be look't for from the &s;ame cau&s;e. To wait for the Spirit, and to depend on him, for teaching and guidance "with|out the word", or in "oppo&s;ition to it", is an endle&s;s path of error. As one expre&s;&s;es it, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John Stillingfleet, "his divine pre&s;ence in the places of religious wor&s;hip", pag. 222, 223.</NOTE> "If there be any delu&s;ions in the world, we mu&s;t own this as the BELZEEBUB among them.

<P>THE other remark, deducible from the pre|ceding di&s;cour&s;e, is, that God, in the work of illumination, con&s;iders men as endow'd with in|tellectual and moral powers, and conducts to|wards them as &s;uch, by influencing the exerci&s;e

of the&s;e powers &s;o as, in "this way", to effect the good plea&s;ure of his grace in them. Tis true, the light of truth held forth in the &s;acred books of &s;cripture, that light by which &s;inners are "turn|ed from darkne&s;s", and enabled to "behold the glory of the Lord", &s;o as to be "changed into the &s;ame image from glory to glory", is ab|&s;olutely the gift of God. He fir&s;t provided it, and then &s;upernaturally &s;ent it down from above. Tis no more owing to men, than the under&s;tand|ing faculty it&s;elf, they are the &s;ubjects of. Both the faculty, and the object, are wholly and equally of God; the latter, as really as the former, and as exclu&s;ively of all human &s;kill, will, or exert|ments of any kind whatever. The work of illu|mination therefore &s;uppo&s;es, both a "faculty" al|ready planted in men's nature, rendering them capable of being enlightened; and the exi&s;tence of "light", whereby it is made po&s;&s;ible this &s;hould be done: And it accordingly lies, not in the phy&s;ical infu&s;ion of any power or capacity, they were not before po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of; nor yet in the com|munication of any other light than that, which is already provided and revealed in the &s;cripture: I &s;ay, it con&s;i&s;ts in neither of the&s;e things, but in &s;uch influences of the Spirit, as are wi&s;ely and powerfully &s;uited, &s;o to bring together the "un|der&s;tanding-faculty" in men, and "go&s;pel-truth", its proper object, as that the latter &s;hall be per|ceived, believed and under&s;tood, to the purpo&s;es of &s;aving and everla&s;ting good. This is all that is wanted; this is all that the Spirit does in the affair of illumination; and this he effects&mdash;how? Not by conveying into men's minds the "&s;alutary truth", either in regard of its evidence, or ju&s;t

How &s;hould rea&s;onable creatures be bro't to perceive, and under&s;tand, the &s;acred truths of revelation, as to their evi|dence, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> meaning, but by the u&s;e of their intel|lectual powers? Why were the&s;e truths commit|ed to writing, under the guidance of the holy Gho&s;t? Why &s;olemnly atte&s;ted to from heaven, and tran&s;mited to after-ages, but that men might read, &s;tudy, believe and under&s;tand them? But how &s;hould they do this, unle&s;s by the exerci&s;e of their minds in thinking, con&s;idering, and rea&s;on|ing? Tis readily acknowledged, &s;in has "darken|ed men's hearts", and "blinded their eyes", the eyes of their under&s;tanding; in&s;omuch that they will never &s;ee "the truth as it is in Je&s;us", &s;o as to perceive its divinity and beauty, and feel its transforming power, unle&s;s by the influence of the illuminating Spirit.

wi&s;dom, or propriety, of a "written revelation", atte&s;ted to by God, and intended for univer&s;al and perpetual u&s;e. If the divine Spirit, in the "con|veyance of the &s;aving truth", does every thing without man, to the &s;etting a&s;ide of all motion, action, or exerci&s;e of the human &s;oul with refer|ence to it, he might directly reveal this truth from heaven to all, God ever intended &s;hould be the hap|py &s;ubjects of it, to the exclu&s;ion of the "written word", as well as the u&s;e of men's faculties: Nor can any good rea&s;on be given, why he don't thus reveal the truth to every man, but that the work of illumination is carried on by the intervening u&s;e of means, and the concurring exerci&s;e of hu|man faculties. And tis upon this &s;uppo&s;ition only, that tho&s;e, to whom the go&s;pel has been &s;ent, are capable of being blamed or puni&s;hed, for not admiting into their minds the truths it reveals. How otherwi&s;e could they, in rea&s;on, be accounted faulty? If men have nothing to do in any kind, with re&s;pect to the admitance of the &s;aving truth into their minds, but the Spirit of God does all, &s;o as intirely to exclude all exertments of their's, in the u&s;e of any means, with what equity could they be blamed or puni&s;hed, &s;hould it never be admited there? Will the righteous judge of all the earth account men &s;inners, and worthy of condemnation, for not being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that, in order to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of which they have nothing to do them&s;elves, and all doings of their's would be u&s;ele&s;s and impertinent? This would be, in reality of con&s;truction, to call them &s;inners, and to condemn them, for not taking God's work out of his hands, and doing that them&s;elves which it lay with him to do, ab&s;olutely without them.

The &s;cripture no where places this matter in a light thus injurious to the name, and di&s;honor|ary to the perfections and government of God. On the contrary, if men admit not the light of go&s;pel-truth into their minds, tis attributed to them&s;elves, the fault is charged upon them, and they are e&s;teemed worthy, on this account, of a heavier condemnation than other men. Says our Savior him&s;elf, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Joh. 3.19.</NOTE> "this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved dark|ne&s;s rather than light, becau&s;e their deeds were evil".

Luk. 13.34.</NOTE> Surely, the&s;e texts are incapable of any real meaning, if, in the work of illumination, the Spirit of God makes no u&s;e of man, of any of his faculties, or exertments, but conveys the &s;aving truth ab&s;o|lutely without him, and &s;o as to &s;et a&s;ide all means, and all endeavours that are human. How is it po&s;&s;ible, in this ca&s;e, that it &s;hould be the fault of men, if they are not the &s;ubjects of this truth?

<P>THE plain truth is, men are not only endow'd with intellectual &amp; moral powers, but charged by

their maker with the care, u&s;e &amp; exerci&s;e of them. And tis upon this foundation only, that they become ca|pable, in the nature of the thing, of moral govern|ment, and of being counted proper &s;ubjects, either of blame or puni&s;hment. And this is as true in re|gard of matters of pure reve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ation, as of meer rea|&s;on. Wherein men can u&s;e the faculties they are endow'd with, and are called of God to u&s;e them, but neglect to do &s;o; or, what is wor&s;e mi&s;u&s;e them to purpo&s;es for which they were not betru&s;ted with them, they are ju&s;tly charg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">able with guilt, and as ju&s;tly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e to puni&s;hment: But to &s;peak of them, as either blameable, or puni&s;hable, wherein they have nothing to do, wherein no exerci&s;e of any faculty they a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of is required, or expected, is, in reality of &s;en&s;e, to &s;ay, that they may be blamed, or puni&s;hed for nothing; which is, in it&s;elf, a downright moral contradiction.</P>
<P>THE re&s;ult from all which is, that the Spirit of God, in the work of illumination, &s;o manages his influ|ences, as that men, notwith&s;tanding what he does, have &s;o much to do them&s;elves that it will be proper|ly their fault, and ju&s;tly chargeable upon them as &s;uch, if they remain de&s;titute of the &s;aving truth. It would therefore be a vain thing in any to excu&s;e their ignorance, or unbelief, of revea|led truths, under the pretence, that the divine Spirit has not been plea&s;ed, as yet, &s;avingly to enlighten their minds. I &s;ee not, I own, but this would be a good excu&s;e, and &s;uch an one as could never be rea&s;onably &s;et a&s;ide, if the work of illumination was accompli&s;hed without any exerci&s;e, motion, or activity, of the human mind; if the Spirit of God was agent in this matter, &s;o
<PB N="311" REF="009925_0316_0F7B3C0F741AFD40">
as utterly to exclude all exertments of men in any &s;hape or form. But if the influences of the Spirit, in the performance of this work, are ac|commodated to the make of men; excite, a&s;&s;i&s;t, &s;uperintend and guide the exertments of their faculties; and co-operate with the&s;e exertments, there is no difficulty in the ca&s;e. All due honor is given to the divine Spirit, and men are agents, notwith&s;tanding his influence; and may ju&s;tly fall under blame, and become liable to puni&s;hment. This is certainly the light in which the &s;cripture always places this matter, and the light in which we mu&s;t view it, if we would entertain right con|ceptions of it.</P>
<P>LET us then, as the conclu&s;ion of all, con&s;ider the intellectual faculties, it has plea&s;ed God to implant in our natures, as betru&s;tments commit|ted to us for improvement. And let us make the be&s;t u&s;e of them we can; e&s;pecially, in order to our believing and knowing tho&s;e &s;acred truths of &s;cripture, which are connected with our eter|nal well-being in the future world. Let us dai|ly look into this book of God, and u&s;e the utmo&s;t care, caution, deliberation, diligence and attenti|on, that we may be, not only convinced by the evidence he has given, that it came from him, but let into the ju&s;t import of the great things contained in it. For, it was purpo&s;ely wrote by in&s;piration of God, to furni&s;h our minds with the knowledge, both of the evidence, and meaning, of tho&s;e truths which may be "&s;avingly" pro|fitable to us. Yet, let us not depend upon the exerci&s;e of our own powers, as tho' we needed no help, and could of our&s;elves, without a&s;&s;i&s;tance

from above, attain to &s;uch a faith in, and under|&s;tanding of, revealed truths, as would avail to our inheriting eternal life. This would be to deceive our&s;elves into ruin. For it ought to be &s;eriou&s;ly remembered, our thinking and rea&s;oning faculty is greatly weakened and di&s;ordered by means of &s;in. We have "darkened our hearts"; and are indeed &s;o under the government of pre|judice, pa&s;&s;ion, and diver&s;e lu&s;ts, both of the fle&s;h, and of the mind, that we &s;tand in ab&s;olute need of the influence and guidance of the Spirit of truth, that our under&s;tandings may be enlighten|ed in the knowledge of tho&s;e things that pertain to the kingdom of God, and of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Let it affect us to think, that God &s;hould &s;o pity us, in that &s;tate of ignorance and blindne&s;s we had bro't our&s;elves into by &s;in, as to make provi|&s;ion for our being enlightened in all &s;piritual knowledge &amp; under&s;tanding. Let us be thank|ful to him for the light of revelation, and for the holy Spirit to give us to &s;ee this light, and &s;o to &s;ee it as to be changed by it into the divine likene&s;s, from glory to glory. The&s;e are favors un&s;peakably great, and call for our humble and thankful adorations before the God of all grace. And let us expre&s;s our gratitude to him, not only by the words of our mouths, but by a &s;ui|table care to comport with the de&s;igns of his mercy, in thus contriving and opening a way for our knowing "the truth as it is in Je&s;us", &s;o knowing it as to be eternally &s;aved by it. Let us endeavour to get our hearts impre&s;&s;ed with a deep &s;en&s;e of the need we &s;tand in of the illumi|nating influences of the good Spirit. Let us importunably &s;eek to God for them. Let us do
<PB N="313" REF="009925_0318_0F7B3C105C8D3440">
nothing to "grieve the Spirit of God", and provoke him to depart away from us. Let us cheri&s;h his motions, and put our&s;elves under his guidance and direction: So may we hope that he will, by helping, and &s;uperintending the exer|ci&s;e of our faculties, "&s;hew us God's ways, teach us his paths", and give us &s;uch a view of the great truths of revelation, as that we &s;hall believe them, and &s;o feel the force of them, as to be form|ed by them to a meetne&s;s for heavenly glory.</P>
<P>AND if we have any of us been &s;o enlightened by the Spirit, as that we are the &s;ubjects of that faith in Chri&s;t, and knowledge in &s;piritual and divine things, which are connected with the "ju&s;tifica|tion of life", let us bow the knee in grateful ac|knowledgements of the rich grace of God, that has been manife&s;ted towards us. And let it be our daily care to grow in the knowledge of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and to get filled with all wi&s;dom and &s;pi|ritual under&s;tanding. Our own endeavours, in the u&s;e of proper means, are nece&s;&s;ary in order hereunto. We have no rea&s;on to expect the a&s;&s;i&s;tances of the divine Spirit in any other way. Tis accordingly &s;een in experience, that "grace", no more than nature, if neglected, and not wi&s;ely improved, will attain to any con&s;iderable degree of perfection. All our powers, at fir&s;t, are feeble and lanquid; and tis in a gradual way, under the divine ble&s;&s;ing, that they acquire &s;trength, and ri&s;e to any con&s;iderable height in glory. Tho', upon our coming into the world, we are endowed with all the powers which are proper to the human kind; yet, they are nothing more, in their ori|ginal implantation, than meer &s;imple capacities;

and it is by time and exerci&s;e, that they gradually dilate, expand, and grow to the maturity, they are fited to attain to. And this is very much the ca&s;e, with re&s;pect to our moral and &s;piritual pow|ers. They are &s;mall, and weak, in their begin|ning; but capable of growth, and naturally tend to it; and will, under the influence of heaven, continually increa&s;e in &s;trength, and go on to|wards perfection, if they are duly exerci&s;ed.

<P>THE &s;tory, of which my text is part, is an ob&s;ervable one, and would, if duly medi|tated on, naturally give ri&s;e to a variety of notes, "profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for in&s;truction in righteou&s;ne&s;s": But my pre&s;ent de&s;ign, and the limits of this di&s;cour&s;e, forbid my taking any further notice of it, than may be occa&s;ionally proper, in order to illu&s;trate the words I have &s;elected to engage your atten|tion, at this time.</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="009925_0323_0F7B3C14F023D658">THEY contain an addre&s;s to our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> way of inquiry, upon no le&s;s an affair than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of eternal life. And the following particu|lars are ob&s;ervable in it.</P>
<P>THE "per&s;on" making this inquiry; the "man|ner" in which he made it; and finally, "the enquiry it&s;elf".</P>
<P N="1">1. AS to the "per&s;on" making this inquiry, he is de&s;cribed, in the text, in a general way only. "Behold one came and &s;aid unto him". But, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the 20th ver&s;e, he is pointed out as a per&s;on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the prime and flower of life. "The young man &s;aith unto him". The evangeli&s;t Luke, in his narrative of this &s;tory, &s;peaks of him as a per|&s;on of figure, one cloathed with authority. "A certain ruler a&s;ked him". And all the evangeli&s;ts, who have related this &s;tory, unite in de&s;cribing him as wealthy, one that "had great po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions".</P>
<P>THESE are the particulars de&s;criptive of the per&s;on, who came to our Savior with the que&s;ti|on in my text. He had probably ju&s;t come to the age of man, and to have a large e&s;tate at his own di&s;po&s;al. And, being a young man of for|tune, and perhaps of &s;uperior accompli&s;hments, he was &s;oon taken notice of, and, while a youth, made a ruler among the Jews. He could &s;carce have been placed under circum&s;tances more like|ly to make him totally tho'tle&s;s of another life. And yet, in the height of youth, and all the en|&s;narements accompanying riches and honor, he extends his view beyond this pre&s;ent world, and inquires what he &s;hould do to obtain an inheri|tance in the better eternal world?</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="009925_0324_0F7B3C158B184948">AN in&s;tructive example this! And I may pertinently take occa&s;ion from it, to be&s;peak our young men of rank and fortune; putting them upon their guard, le&s;t they &s;hould live unmind|ful of their &s;ouls, and the &s;tate that is beyond the grave. Your danger, in this re&s;pect, is awfully great. You are now in that period of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, which is attended with peculiar temptation<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, as well as advantages; and the temptations, in regard of you, are much greater, and more numerous, than in regard of ordinary young people. O how common is it for young per&s;ons, in your circum|&s;tances, to abandon them&s;elves to levity and va|nity; "walking in the way of their own hearts, and in the &s;ight of their own eyes, not knowing", not con&s;idering, "that God will bring them into judgment for the&s;e things"! How common to pervert the de&s;ign of God's be&s;towments on them, by taking occa&s;ion from them to gratifie their lu&s;ts, whether of the fle&s;h, or mind! How common to give them&s;elves up to the enjoy|ments of time and &s;en&s;e; living in the world, as tho' they had no faith in God, no faith in re|velation, no &s;en&s;e of religion, no concern about their exi&s;tence beyond the grave! O take heed, that you al&s;o be not drawn a&s;ide, and enticed, by the amu&s;ements and plea&s;ures of this vain and evil world! And while &s;o many of your age, and circum&s;tances in life, are practically &s;aying to their &s;ouls, "take your ea&s;e, eat, drink, and be merry"; let it be your inquiry, "what &s;hall we do to inherit eternal life"? And be wanting in no labors, nor in the u&s;e of any proper means, that you may finally, of the mercy of God, thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t, come to the enjoyment of it Re|member,
<PB N="320" REF="009925_0325_0F7B3C1642D53458">
if you don't get into &s;uch a &s;tate in this world, as that, when you leave it, you may enter upon the happy life, that is the great promi&s;e of the go&s;pel, you mu&s;t &s;uffer the "&s;econd death": Nor will the di&s;tinction, in outward and civil re&s;pects, it has plea&s;ed God to make between you and others, &s;erve in the lea&s;t to &s;ecure you herefrom; it will rather be a means to render the pains of this death the more dreadful and in|tolerable.</P>
<P>BUT it &s;hould be the care, not only of young per&s;ons of figure &amp; fortune, but of every condition, to inquire "what they &s;hall do to inherit eternal life"? And to pur&s;ue this enquiry to effect. This is the "one thing needful". Nothing can be propo&s;ed to you of more &s;erious weight, and awful importance. Your everla&s;ting well-being is con|nected herewith. And what more proper &s;ea&s;on for the bui&s;ine&s;s of religion, and the concerns of the &s;oul and &s;alvation, than the age of youth? Now is eminently "the accepted time, and the day of &s;alvation". Now you are under the greate&s;t ad|vantages to &s;ecure the favor of God, and an intere&s;t in the only con&s;tituted redeemer of &s;inners. Now, if you &s;eek to God for his mercy, you will have the mo&s;t probable pro&s;pect of finding it: But if you lo&s;e this opportunity, you will never have a better, and you know not that you &s;hall have any other.

Beg of God to impre&s;s your minds with a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of the importance of &s;piritual and eternal concerns. And if &s;uch a &s;en&s;e has been excited in any of you, don't &s;uffer it to wear off; but let it quicken and

invigorate your endeavours, in the u&s;e of all appointed means, that you may be formed to a meetne&s;s for that life in heaven, which &s;hall never have an end.</P>
<P>THERE is yet another thing, in the character of this young man, worthy of notice; and that is, his regular life. He was no fornicator, nor adulterer, nor lyar, nor prophane &s;wearer; but &s;eems rather to have been a youth of a &s;ober, blamele&s;s conver|&s;ation. He therefore reply'd, when our Savior bid him "keep the commandments", as in the 20th ver. "ma&s;ter, all the&s;e have I ob&s;erved from my youth". And he probably &s;pake the truth, ac|cording to the &s;en&s;e, in which he had been in&s;truct|ed, by the jewi&s;h teachers, to under&s;tand the law. There is no rea&s;on to think, but he had ab&s;tained from tho&s;e follies, which too commonly pollute the lives of young people. And be&s;ides this, he had, in all likelihood, been externally devout; a wor|&s;hipper of the God of his fathers; an ob&s;erver of the &s;abbath, and the various rites of the Mo&s;aic di&s;|pen&s;ation; a man &s;trictly cha&s;te and temperate in his life; and, in a word, as "touching the righte|ou&s;ne&s;s that is of the law", externally "blamele&s;s". And it was much to his honor, that he had been &s;o far religious. Tis ob&s;erveable, it was more e&s;pe|cially upon the account of his blamele&s;s &s;ober life, that our Savior "loved him". So &s;peaks the evangeli&s;t Mark, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. 10. ver. 21.</NOTE> "THEN Je&s;us beholding him, loved him. THEN, that is, "when he had an&s;wer|ed, and &s;aid, all the&s;e have I ob&s;erved from my youth".</P>
<P><PB N="322" REF="009925_0327_0F7B3C18A265C170">I MAY properly take occa&s;ion from hence, to urge upon our young people a care to conform their external practice to the divine law. This, it is true, will not &s;uffice to con&s;titute you good men, in the e&s;timation either of the law, or go&s;pel. If you go no further, you will &s;till lack that which is ab&s;olutely needful. But for all this, a freedom from the outward acts of &s;in, is very commendable: Nor is it (as the times now are) a de&s;picable at|tainment. Would to God, it could be &s;aid with truth of all our youths, they are not given "to rioting and wontone&s;s"; they "have no fellow&s;hip with the unfruitful works of darkne&s;s"; they pro|phane neither the day, nor name of God; but are, to all appearance, virtuous and &s;ober! It would rejoice the hearts of many &s;ollicitous parents, and yield a comfortable pro&s;pect, with reference to the ri&s;ing generation. But alas! there are too many, among our young people, who give a loo&s;e to their &s;en&s;ual inclinations, and are even &s;candalous in their pur&s;uits of carnal plea&s;ures. And when &s;uch num|bers of young per&s;ons are &s;o &s;hamefully attached to the vanities of time and &s;en&s;e, denying them&s;elves &s;carce any thing their heart can wi&s;h, or their eyes look upon; how happily di&s;tingui&s;hed would you be, from the many of your age, &s;hou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d you "flee youth|ful lu&s;ts", and e&s;cape tho&s;e follies whereby their lives are polluted? Should you be cha&s;te and mo|de&s;t, &s;ober and temperate; in a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l things confor|ming your external behaviour to the divine law? Tis true indeed, as I ju&s;t now ob&s;erved, freedom from vice, and a meer external conformity to the law, won't argue that men are po&s;&s;e&s;t of the "real power of godline&s;s". There mu&s;t be a "heart purified by faith", as well as the outward appear|ance
<PB N="323" REF="009925_0328_0F7B3C19AE179368">
of virtue in the life. But this notwith&s;tand|ing, a freedom from &s;in, e&s;pecially in in&s;tances that are gro&s;s and hainous, is infinitely better than an allowed indulgence to vice and wickedne&s;s. And tis a glory to a young man, or woman, to be un|like to the multitudes of their age, who are &s;hame|fully debauched in their morals. Tis indeed an agreeable &s;ight to behold one and another, in the bloom of life, avoiding this and the other bad cour&s;e, ab&s;taining from this and the other corrupt cu&s;tom, and maintaining a care to be hone&s;t, &s;ober and cha&s;te; tho' they &s;hould not have attained &s;o high as to be "transformed in their minds by the renewing of the holy Gho&s;t". Our Savior loved the young man &s;poken of in my text, tho' he had no more religion than this comes to; and he will love you al&s;o with the &s;ame kind of love.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE next thing ob&s;ervable in my text, is the "manner" in which this young man inquired of our Savior, with reference to eternal life. And tis &s;ufficiently evident, that it was with a becoming decency. He appears to have been a well-bred youth, one who knew how to behave, and was di&s;|po&s;ed to behave, towards tho&s;e with whom he had occa&s;ion to conver&s;e, with re&s;pectful agreablene&s;s. We are told in the text, that, upon coming to our Lord for in&s;truction in the affairs of another life, he &s;aluted him in that &s;tile, "good ma&s;ter"! He calls him "ma&s;ter"; owning his authority as a teach|er, putting him&s;elf in the place of a learner, and tacitly &s;ugge&s;ting his readine&s;s to receive in&s;truction. He gives him the title of "good"; &s;ignifying the honorable opinion he had of him, as well as hope of being kindly an&s;wered, as concerning the &s;erious and important que&s;tion he had propo&s;ed to him.</P>
<P><PB N="324" REF="009925_0329_0F7B3C1A0534FE18">NOR was his language only re&s;pectful, but he treated our Savior with becoming decency in his behaviour; for, as the evangeli&s;t Mark ob&s;erves, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. 10. ver. 17.</NOTE> "he kneeled to him", no doubt in veneration of him as an extraordinary teacher, one far &s;uperior to the Scribes and Phari&s;ees, who &s;at in Mo&s;es's &s;eat Of all the per&s;ons, who addre&s;&s;ed to our Lord for religious in&s;truction, we read of none, who car|ried it towards him with greater external decorum. And it is the more ob&s;ervable in this young man, becau&s;e he was both rich and honorable. And riches and honor united in the &s;ame per&s;on, e&s;peci|ally when young, before he is arrived to maturity in judgment, and to have had experience of the world, is apt to elate his mind, puffing him up with a vain conceit of him&s;elf, and rendering him unfit to receive in&s;truction, or to treat tho&s;e with a becom|ing reverence, who are able to give it him. But it was not thus with this young man. Notwith|&s;tanding the elevation of his circum&s;tances in life, he appears to have been a mode&s;t youth of a &s;weet, agreable, endearing deportment. To be &s;ure, his behaviour towards Chri&s;t was decent and re&s;pectful.</P>
<P>YOUNG people &s;hould learn from, this example, a becoming, winning, re&s;pectful carriage, e&s;peci|ally towards their &s;uperiors. This will beautifie your character, and render you amiable in the eyes of all, who have opportunity to behold the decen|cy of your deportment: Whereas, if you are rude in your &s;peech and behaviour, you will appear with an ill grace, and make but a di&s;agreable figure.</P>
<P><PB N="325" REF="009925_0330_0F7B3C1AC170A700">I SHALL not think it a needle&s;s digre&s;&s;ion here to recommand this re&s;pectful carriage, in young per|&s;ons towards their &s;uperiors, in a few &s;pecial in&s;tan|ces. As thus,</P>
<P>CHILDREN &s;hould behave with all dutiful re|verence towards their parents Their &s;peech &s;hould be grave, mannerly, engaging; and their carriage &s;uch as may be expre&s;&s;ive of &s;uitable e&s;teem and honor. This is particularly required in the 5th commandment, which is, "thou &s;hal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> honor thy father, and thy mother" And what more agrea|ble, than to behold an habitual veneration in chil|dren towards t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eir parents, di&s;covered upon all proper occa&s;ions both in their &s;peech and behaviour? There is &s;carce a more plea&s;ant &s;ight. It recom|mends &s;uch children to the approbation of all, who have any notion, either of civil or religious decency, and propriety: Whereas on the contrary, what more grating than to hear children be&s;peaking their parents in terms of di&s;re&s;pect? Or to &s;ee them be|having towards them, in a rude and un&s;eemly manner?</P>
<P>IN like manner, tho&s;e young per&s;ons, who, by the authority of their parents, or guardians, and by their own con&s;ent, are fixed, in order to their future advantage, in the relation of &s;ervants to others, &s;hould behave towards them with all decent re&s;pect both in word and deed. They &s;hould not be&s;peak their ma&s;ters, as tho' they were their equals; much le&s;s &s;hould their carriage towards them be expre&s;&s;ive of the want of due ho|nor, and reverence. The apo&s;tle exhorts, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. 6.1.</NOTE> "Let as many &s;ervants as are under the yoke,
<PB N="326" REF="009925_0331_0F7B3C1BCDDC2050">
account their own ma&s;ters worthy of all honor, that the name of God, and his doctrine, be not bla&s;phe|med". It tends to the reproach of religion, and occa&s;ions unworthy reflections on the name of God, and his doctrine, when &s;ervants, in&s;tead of expre&s;&s;ing a ju&s;t e&s;teem and reverence of their ma&s;ters, carry it indecently towards them, whether in language, or behavior. The prophet therefore ob&s;erves, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mal. 1.6.</NOTE> "A &s;ervant honoreth his ma&s;ter". A good &s;ervant does &s;o, one who has upon his mind a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of his duty: Nor otherwi&s;e will he de&s;erve this character.</P>
<P>MOREOVER, young per&s;ons &s;hould carry it towards tho&s;e who are in age, with all &s;uitable de|ference. Their age gives them &s;uperiority, be their circum&s;tances, on other accounts, as they will; and makes a re&s;pectful deportment towards them, de|cent and proper. That therefore was a law in I&s;rael, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Levit. 19.32.</NOTE> "Thou &s;halt ri&s;e up before the hoary head, and honor the face of the old man". And tis peculiarly graceful, when children and young people treat their fathers in age, in a manner becom|ing their &s;uperiority in years. It di&s;covers a mode&s;ty of temper, an ingenuity of di&s;po&s;ition, which are highly recommending: Whereas, if the "child behaves him&s;elf proudly again&s;t the ancient"; if he carries it towards him with neglect, or de&s;pi&s;es him becau&s;e he is old, either in language or behaviour, it argues a bad turn of mind, and is offen&s;ive in the &s;ight both of God and man. But e&s;pecially ought young people to be cautious of every thing, that does not favour of a ju&s;t decorum towards tho&s;e, who&s;e "hoary heads are a crown of glory to them, being found in the way of righteou&s;ne&s;s".</P>
<P><PB N="327" REF="009925_0332_0F7B3C1C3B1A5F00">In the&s;e, and &s;uch like in&s;tances, &s;hould young per&s;ons endeavour to render them&s;elves agreable. They may, tis true, fall &s;hort of the power of reli|gion, tho they &s;hould behave towards their &s;uperi|ors, in this graceful manner we have de&s;cribed; but tis a de&s;irable conduct notwith&s;tanding. It render|ed the young man in my text lovely in the &s;ight of the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us. And tis in it&s;elf a lovely recom|mending circum&s;tance in the character of a young per&s;on of whatever condition in life. It di&s;co|vers a becoming &s;weetne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition, an agrea|ble mode&s;ty and obligingne&s;s of temper, which are highly ornamental, and appear &s;o in the eyes of the whole civili<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d, not to &s;ay, chri&s;tian world.</P>
<P>THERE is yet another thing, as to the "man|ner", in which this young man inquired about eter|nal life, well worthy of notice; and that is, the engagedne&s;s of heart with which he did it. It was indeed the &s;erious concern he had upon his mind about the affairs of another world, that bro't him to our Savior, and put him upon making the inqui|ry in my text. Some came to him to a&s;k him que&s;ti|ons, not from any &s;erious &s;en&s;e they had of religion, not with a view to receive in&s;truction; but that they might en&s;nare him in his di&s;cour&s;e. But this was not the temper of mind, with which this young man came to our Lord. He appears, from the general run of the &s;tory, to have been a tho'tful &s;e|rious young man; and he was probably, at this time, under an awaken'd concern about the great affair of eternal life. To be &s;ure, he appears like one, who&s;e heart was full of the matter. Hence the evangeli&s;t Mark ob&s;erves, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. 10. v. 17.</NOTE> that "he came run|ning"
<PB N="328" REF="009925_0333_0F7B3C1F10890458">
to our Lord. This denotes the engagedne&s;s of his heart. He was earne&s;t and eager to be re|&s;olv'd in the important que&s;tion he had to make, relative to eternal life.</P>
<P>AND he has herein &s;et an example, worthy of the imitation of young per&s;ons; yea, of all per&s;ons what&s;oever. What &s;hould engage our concern, if not an affair that relates to "our everla&s;ting well|being, in that world we mu&s;t go into, when we &s;hall no longer live in this? O the &s;tupidity of tho&s;e multitudes, who are &s;o concerned about the pre&s;ent life, that they have none at all about the other! One would think it impo&s;&s;ible, rea&s;onable creatures &s;hould be guily of &s;uch madne&s;s of folly! and yet, it is the very folly the generality of mankind run into. They run into it at their fir&s;t &s;etting out in the world, and too commonly continue in it as long as they live; as if their great and only bui&s;ine&s;s was, to pur&s;ue the profits, and plea&s;e them&s;elves with the amu&s;ements and vanities of this evil and tran|&s;itory world. The good Lord open our eyes to &s;ee our amazing folly, and awaken in us a &s;erious and deep concern about the affairs of religion and ano|ther world! This is the fir&s;t thing nece&s;&s;ary. Con|cern about any thing is the &s;pring of all endea|vours, with reference to it. We mu&s;t therefore be concerned about eternal life. And if this o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce comes to be our ca&s;e, and our concern is deep and thorow, we &s;hall be &s;eriou&s;ly inqui&s;itive, how we may obtain it; and our endeavours, con&s;equent hereupon, will be &s;uch, as that we &s;hall be in "a hopeful way" of being prepared in this world, for the enjoyment of eternal ble&s;&s;edne&s;s in the next.&mdash; But I mu&s;t now proceed to the&mdash;</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="329" REF="009925_0334_0F7B3C1FCDA875C0">3. THIRD thing ob&s;ervable in the text, and this is, "the inquiry it&s;elf", the young man propo|&s;es to our Savior; contained in tho&s;e words, "what good thing &s;hall I do, that I may have eternal life"?</P>
<P>HE here takes it for granted, that there is another life after the pre&s;ent is ended, and that it may be an eternally happy one. So that he had faith in this fir&s;t, and e&s;&s;ential article of all religion. And, probably, the foundation of it was, not the exerci&s;e of his rea&s;on upon meer na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ural principles, but upon the &s;criptures of the old-te&s;tament which, be|ing a Jew, he had in his hands, and looked upon as wrote by holy men in&s;pired by God. And it were to be wi&s;hed, that all who are favour'd with the writings of the new, as well as old te&s;tament, had the like faith. There are Saducees among chri&s;ti|ans, &s;o called, as there were among the Jews; that is, men of corrupt minds, who &s;ay there is "nei|ther angel, nor &s;pirit", nor future &s;tate of exi&s;tence, hereby era&s;ing the foundation of all religion For "he that cometh to God, mu&s;t believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently &s;eek him", as the author of the epi&s;tle to the Hebrews expre&s;&s;es it. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">11. Chap. 6th ver.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE young man, in my text, was not in this corrupt way of thinking. For he &s;uppo&s;es it a matter pa&s;t all di&s;pute, that there was &s;uch a thing as eternal life; and his inquiry accordingly is, not whether there was &s;uch a life? But "what he &s;hould do that he might have it"?</P>
<P><PB N="330" REF="009925_0335_0F7B3C2015012AB0">AND here it is apprehended by mo&s;t interpreters, that he di&s;covered his ignorance of the go&s;pel-method of &s;alvation by grace thro' Chri&s;t. And tis highly probable, being a Jew, and educated in the principles generally received in that day, his mind was leaven'd with the notion of obtaining life upon the foot of law. He doubtle&s;s imagin|ed, when he propo&s;ed the que&s;tion, in my text, that doing was the ground or rea&s;on upon which he might hope for life. Some good thing he &s;uppo&s;ed mu&s;t be done; and he de&s;ires to be in|&s;tructed, what this good thing was, that he might do it. And here lay his ultimate dependance. It was his doing this good thing he concluded would, in its own virtue, give him a right to eter|nal life: In which he was gro&s;ly mi&s;taken, and really "e&s;tabli&s;hed his own righteou&s;ne&s;s", in&s;tead of honoring Chri&s;t as "the end of the law for righteou&s;ne&s;s to every one that believeth".</P>
<P>YOU will then po&s;&s;ibly a&s;k, mu&s;t the concern|ed &s;inner &s;it &s;till, and do nothing in order to eter|nal life? Or, if he does any thing, will he be chargeable with "ignorance of God's righteou&s;|ne&s;s", and "e&s;tabli&s;hing his own"?</P>
<P>I ANSWER, this will by no means follow from what has been &s;aid, with reference to this young queri&s;t Tis true indeed, and readily acknow|ledged to be &s;o, that nothing ought to be done in the &s;en&s;e, in which he under&s;tood doing, in the que&s;tion he put to our Savior. For he undoubt|edly imagined, that doing was that, in the &s;ole virtue of which, upon the &s;ole account of which, he might obtain a right to eternal life: In which
<PB N="331" REF="009925_0336_0F7B3C20C663C5D0">
view of doing, nothing can be done by us; nor indeed ought we &s;o much as to attempt the doing of any thing; yea, &s;o far is doing, or any attempt towards it, in this &s;en&s;e, either nece&s;&s;ary, or fit, that it is, in reality of con&s;truction, and by ju&s;t con&s;equence, a &s;ubver&s;ion of grace and faith; for "if righteou&s;ne&s;s comes by the law, faith is made void, and Chri&s;t is dead in vain"; as the apo&s;tle Paul argues, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gal. 2.21.</NOTE> But &s;till, &s;inners in concern about eternal life, ought by no means to &s;it idle, as tho' they had nothing to do. For tho' they can do nothing, nor ought to do any thing, as the "con&s;ideration" upon which they may hope for the obtainment of life; yet, in &s;ub&s;erviency to Chri&s;t, and while their dependance is principally and ultimately on him, and not on the virtue o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> wo thine&s;s of their own doings, they may do all within the verge of their power. They may "a&s;k, &s;eek, knock"; they may "watch, pray, labor, &s;trive, wre&s;tle, fight", and, in a word, "do with their might what&s;oever their hands find to do", a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the &s;cripture expre&s;&s;ions are. And they ought, tis their undoubted duty, thus to exert them|&s;elves to the utmo&s;t: Nor will they, by &s;o doing, be ju&s;tly chargeable with "fru&s;trating" either "the grace of God", or that "righteou&s;ne&s;s of his which is by faith": Nay, tis only in this way of doing, that they may rea&s;onably hope for the obtainment of that "eternal life, which is the gift of God, thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord".</P>
<P>BUT as this is a matter of very con&s;iderable importance, I &s;hall not think it either unprofita|ble, or un&s;ea&s;onable, if I am at &s;ome pains to &s;et
<PB N="332" REF="009925_0337_0F7B3C2180238D90">
it in a more full and di&s;tinct light. In order whereto let it be remembered,</P>
<P>THERE are three things, with reference to the great affair of eternal life, which are worthy of &s;pecial note; namely, the ri&s;e or &s;ource of the divine plan, conformably to which it becomes obtainable; the moral ground or foundation, upon which it is obtained; and finally, the cha|racter of the per&s;ons who &s;hall actually obtain it.</P>
<P>JUST conceptions of the&s;e things will, if I mi&s;|take not, lead us into ju&s;t ideas of our own exert|ments. We &s;hall herefrom clearly perceive, not only its being fit and rea&s;onable, that we &s;hould be up and doing, but be in&s;tructed how to give what we do, its proper place, and due &s;ubordina|tion, in the bui&s;ine&s;s of eternal life.</P>
<P>AS to the fir&s;t of the&s;e things, the &s;ource of the plan, conformably to which eternal life becomes obtainable,&mdash;it is the free favor of God, his un|de&s;erved love and good-will. The excitement hereto was not from without, but lay wholly in his own brea&s;t. It proceded from the e&s;&s;ential, everla&s;ting, &s;upremely perfect benevolence of his nature. No fore&s;een doings of our's, in any &s;hape whatever, had the lea&s;t influence to per|&s;uade hereto. "He fir&s;t loved us". We were indeed "&s;inners" in the view of God, when he came into the go&s;pel-&s;cheme of be&s;towing life. Adorable grace therefore was that, and that only, which moved him hereto. It &s;prang from this &s;ource, antecedently to all other con&s;iderations whatever. Even the appointment of Chri&s;t, to
<PB N="333" REF="009925_0338_0F7B3C229C793328">
carry the plan of life into execution, was po&s;terior to, and con&s;equent upon, this love of God, and one of the amazingly glorious effects of it. "God &s;o loved the world, that he gave his only begot|ten &s;on, that we might have life thro' him".</P>
<P>NOW, the con&s;equence naturally and obviou&s;ly deducible from the&s;e premi&s;es is, that eternal life, in regard of its being an obtainable ble&s;&s;ing, has no connection with, or the lea&s;t dependance on, any thing we can do: Nor is it either nece&s;&s;ary, or fit, that we &s;hould do any thing, or attempt to do any thing, as tho' we could hereby move the heart of God to a willingne&s;s that life might be obtainable. This would be to &s;ub&s;titute works in the room of grace; taking that glory to our|&s;elves, which is due only to God: Whereas, that ab&s;olutely free favor, and unde&s;erved love of God, to which it is owing that life is attainable, &s;hould be the fir&s;t and great object of our depend|ance; and what we do, &s;hould be done in a be|coming &s;ub&s;erviency hereto Grace, in this way, will be principally honored, and not our &s;elves. And I may pertinently add, tis only this way of doing, that is adapted to give ea&s;e and quiet to the &s;inner's con&s;cience He might well be filled with de&s;ponding anxiety and fear, if his depend|ance was on his own worthle&s;s doings to move the h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">art of God towards him; but while he exerts him&s;elf, having his chief and ultimate dependance on that boundle&s;s grace of God, which, from everla&s;ting, gave ri&s;e to the plan of redemption, he may rea&s;onably take heart, and be of good courage. For, "if, while an enemy", the love of God was &s;uch, as to purpo&s;e and contrive a
<PB N="334" REF="009925_0339_0F7B3C2383415FC0">
way, wherein he might "be reconciled; how much more, being thus far reconciled", may he hope to obtain life?</P>
<P>THE next thing, in regard of eternal life, wor|thy of particular remark is, the moral ground or rea&s;on of its be&s;towment. And this is the meri|torious life and death of our ble&s;&s;ed Savior Je&s;us Chri&s;t. The in&s;pired writings, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the new-te&s;tament, every where lead us to think thus of the matter. I need not turn you to the texts. You are all, it may rea&s;onably be pre&s;umed, too well acquainted with them to be ignorant, that that glorious per&s;on, the only be|gotten &s;on of God, while in our world, a partaker of fle&s;h and blood, both did and &s;uffered every thing that was nece&s;&s;ary, in order to a righteou&s;|ne&s;s, on account of which God might, in con&s;i&s;t|ency with the honor of his perfections, and the authority of his law and government, make the grant of eternal life. Accordingly, this meritori|ous righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t is that, for the &s;ake of which, upon the account of which, this ble&s;&s;ing is confer'd. And on whom&s;oever it is confer'd, this is the true ground or rea&s;on of its be&s;tow|ment.</P>
<P>TIS ea&s;ie now to collect from this remark, that no doings of our's are to be look't upon, as the rea&s;on, or con&s;ideration, upon which the gift of life is made. In this &s;en&s;e, all works of righteou&s;ne&s;s, done by us, are totally u&s;ele&s;s&punc; yea, the doing of them would reflect di&s;honor on Chri&s;t, as tho' his worthine&s;s was an in&s;ufficient ground of dependance for life. The plain truth
<PB N="335" REF="009925_0340_0F7B3C23F1E29588">
is, the perfect righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t is the one only meritorious cau&s;e of eternal life. For which rea&s;on, we are to do nothing, it is not fit we &s;hould do any thing, we cannot indeed do any thing, in the virtue of which, upon the account of which, we may hope to obtain life. All doings of our's in this &s;en&s;e, would be that "e&s;tabli&s;hment of our own righteou&s;ne&s;s", in oppo&s;ition to "the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God by faith", which is &s;o often caution'd again&s;t by the apo&s;tle Paul. They are therefore, in this view of them, with great care, and particularity excluded, in his epi&s;tles, from having any, the lea&s;t hand in the affair of &s;alvation: And with the highe&s;t rea&s;on; for if life could be obtained in the virtue of any doings of our's, it would "come thro' the law, and not thro' the righteou&s;ne&s;s of faith"; which would "make faith void", and the life and death of Chri&s;t of none effect".</P>
<P>THE la&s;t thing to be taken notice of, with re|&s;pect to eternal life, is the per&s;ons upon whom it &s;hall actually be be&s;towed. And the&s;e are not &s;inners in common. For tho' eternal life, of the rich &s;uperabounding grace of God, is a ble&s;&s;ing obtainable by all without exception; and tho' the true rea&s;on of its be&s;towment, the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, is meritoriou&s;ly &s;ufficient for all: Yet, the actual be&s;towment of it is limited to &s;ome only, and the&s;e, of a certain character. Unbelieving impenitent &s;inners, &s;o living, and &s;o dying, in&s;tead of entering into life, &s;hall &s;uffer the "&s;econd death": Nor will the grace of God, or the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, be any &s;ecurity to them herefrom. The per&s;ons upon whom God
<PB N="336" REF="009925_0341_0F7B3C249CBD5C60">
will actually be&s;tow eternal life are tho&s;e, who &s;o believe in his &s;on Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as to be po&s;&s;e&s;t of a di&s;po&s;ition to true holine&s;s, that will throw it&s;elf out into &s;uitable corre&s;ponding acts, as occa|&s;ions are offered therefor in the providence of God. This is the "grand mark", by which they are de&s;cribed in the revelations of &s;cripture. And upon whom&s;oever it is found, whether they are Jews, or Gentiles; whether they be bond, or free; whether they are male or female; they are, in the go&s;pel e&s;timation, &s;ubjectively meet for the be&s;towment of life; and life &s;hall actually be be&s;towed upon them, of the rich grace of God, upon account of the meritorious righte|ou&s;ne&s;s of his &s;on Je&s;us Chri&s;t. And the&s;e are the only per&s;ons, upon whom he will be&s;tow it. As for all others, be they who they will, or their character what it will, their doom will be, to be "ca&s;t into outer darkne&s;s, where is weeping, and wailing, and gna&s;hing of teeth".</P>
<P>THIS remark now will clearly and di&s;tinctly point out to us the &s;uitablene&s;s of our own ex|ertions, with reference to eternal life; and, at the &s;ame time, a&s;certain their proper u&s;e, and place, in this momentous affair.</P>
<P>WE have &s;een, that eternal life will be be&s;tow|ed upon none but per&s;ons of "&s;uch a character", that is, upon none but tho&s;e, who are &s;ubjective|ly meet for it. What therefore we have to do, lies wholly in endeavours relating to this character, and this meetne&s;s. God, of his free favor, has ab&s;olutely made eternal life an obtainable ble&s;&s;ing. Here then we have nothing to do. All doings
<PB N="337" REF="009925_0342_0F7B3C254644B4B0">
of our's would be impertinent. Chri&s;t, by his me|ritorious righteou&s;ne&s;s, has furni&s;hed a compleat|ly perfect rea&s;on for the be&s;towment of it. Here al&s;o it would be highly ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e, we had any thing to do. This would be to place our own doings in the room of the perfect righteou&s;|ne&s;s of Chri&s;t; which is, con&s;tructively, a &s;ubver|&s;ion of the go&s;pel. All therefore that we have to do mu&s;t relate to that character, which the con&s;titution of the go&s;pel makes nece&s;&s;ary in order to the actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and enjoyment of that eter|nal life, which the free favor of God has made obtainable, and which he may honorably be&s;tow in con&s;ideration of his &s;on's meritorious righte|ou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>AND in this view of doing, there is both room for it, and an high degree of fitne&s;s in it, while we properly &s;ubordinate what we do to Chri&s;t and grace. For it is to be remembered, tho' God is the principal agent in the application of redemp|tion, or, what means the &s;ame thing, in forming the character, without which he will never be&s;tow eternal life; yet, in the doing of this, he con|&s;iders us as intelligent and moral agents, as be|ings endowed with the &s;everal powers of thinking, rea&s;oning, willing, choo&s;ing, refu&s;ing, de&s;iring, hop|ing, loving, fearing, hating, &amp; the like; and accord|ingly deals with us as &s;uch, by co-operating with the&s;e powers, in u&s;e of proper means, &s;uitably adju&s;t+ed to their nature. He don't make men believers, without the u&s;e of their own faculties; neither does he form them to this character, by giving them new faculties, or by de&s;troying, or making any phy&s;ical change, in their old ones; but ac|compli&s;hes
<PB N="338" REF="009925_0343_0F7B3C25FB0C4D70">
his plea&s;ure in them, by accommoda|ting his agency to their proper make and con&s;ti|tution. The bible always repre&s;ents the matter in this light. And this method of acting exhi|bits the true rea&s;on of the erection of God's vi&s;ible kingdom, under the admini&s;tration of his &s;on Je&s;us Chri&s;t, with all its means, privileges, mo|tives and ble&s;&s;ings. Of what &s;ignificancy would it be to place &s;inners under the go&s;pel-di&s;pen&s;a|tion, if they had nothing to do but to &s;it &s;till? In this view of the matter, of what u&s;e would the in&s;titutions of religion be to them? Of what &s;ervice, the in&s;tructions, calls, intreaties, coun&s;els, warnings and encouragements of God's word? To what purpo&s;e would it be to apply to them to enlighten their minds, to influence their wills, to alarm their con&s;ciences, to awaken their pa&s;&s;ions and affections? There would be no pro|priety, I might rather &s;ay, there would be a down|right impropriety and ab&s;urdity, in this method of dealing with them, if they had nothing to do but to wait till God, without any exertion of their's, &s;hould make them meet for eternal life.</P>
<P>TIS he indeed that forms men to this meet|ne&s;s; but he does it mediately, and in a way &s;uited to their nature as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;onable and moral beings. Tis therefore ob&s;ervable, faith, conver|&s;ion, the new man in Chri&s;t, which con&s;titute the character of tho&s;e who are "meet for the inheri|tance of the &s;aints in light", are not only &s;poken of, in the in&s;pired writings, as "the work of God", but a work that he begins, maintains, car|ries on, and compleats, with the "concurring agency of men them&s;elves", in the u&s;e of various
<PB N="339" REF="009925_0344_0F7B3C2787EE7CB0">
means wi&s;ely adapted to the purpo&s;e. Here therefore there is both room, and opportunity for the exertment of our rea&s;onable powers; and if we neglect to make the proper u&s;e of them, we can reflect the blame no where but on our&s;elves, if we are never made the &s;ubjects of that faith which is to &s;alvation.</P>
<P>THE plain truth is, God, man, and means, are all concerned in the formation of that character, without which we cannot inherit eternal life. They ought not therefore to be &s;et in oppo&s;ition to each other; but &s;hould be con&s;idered as jointly agree|ing, and concurring, in this great affair. And the &s;eparating the&s;e, or the oppo&s;ing them to one another, or the &s;etting a&s;ide any one of them in order to exalt the other, is a di&s;&s;ervice to religion, and dangerous to the &s;ouls of men. The order of the divine plan, and harmony of its parts, are hereby broke in upon, and tho&s;e things disjoin'd, and viewed as counter-acting each other, which the wi&s;dom of God has join'd together, and duely &s;ubordinated to each other.</P>
<P>IF, on the one hand, it would be extremely unrea&s;onable, and highly derogatory from the honor of God's grace, becau&s;e, in many texts of &s;cripture, we are called upon "to believe, repent, and be converted", to argue from hence, there is no need of the powerful operations of the divine Spirit to introduce that moral change which is &s;ignified by the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions: So would it, on the other hand, be extravagant and ab&s;urd, be|cau&s;e faith and conver&s;ion are a&s;cribed to the in|fluences of God's grace, to conclude herefrom,
<PB N="340" REF="009925_0345_0F7B3C284536AFB0">
that there is no propriety in the u&s;e of means; no need of preaching, or hearing, or praying; no need of in&s;tructions and motives, nor of the exerci&s;e of our own powers in attending to them; nor of any exertments of our's, that this work may be accompli&s;hed in us. Tis true, means, in them&s;elves &s;imply con&s;idered, will do nothing to any &s;aving purpo&s;e; but &s;till, God, by the pow|erful influences of his Spirit, can render them effectual; and with this dependance only &s;hould we u&s;e them. Tis true al&s;o, we are, in our pre|&s;ent fallen &s;tate, poor, weak, corrupt and &s;inful creatures; but however weak and corrupt we are, we yet retain the character of intelligent moral agents; and the grace of God does not &s;uper&s;ede our activity, neither does it de&s;troy our faculties as men, but &s;uppo&s;es the exertment of them; and by their exertment, duely &s;ubordinated to the influences of the divine Spirit, and concur|ring with them, that work of grace is wro't in us, whereby we are made meet for eternal life.</P>
<P>THE &s;hort of the matter is, the &s;cripture every where con&s;iders us as men, as moral and intelli|gent agents, and repre&s;ents God as beginning and carrying on the work of faith and conver&s;ion in a way analagous to our make as &s;uch, by mak|ing u&s;e of means, and requiring our attention to them, and the exertment of even all our pow|ers in &s;ubordination to him, and the all-powerful influences of his grace and Spirit. A great part of the bible would be unintelligible upon any other &s;cheme of tho't. If it did not lie with us to make u&s;e of our &s;everal faculties, whether in|tellectual or moral, why has God taken &s;uch care,
<PB N="341" REF="009925_0346_0F7B3C2904768C30">
in all &s;uitable ways, to apply to them to excite their exerci&s;e? Why has he offered &s;o much light to inform our under&s;tandings? Why, &s;o many motives to per&s;uade our wills? Why, &s;o many awakening con&s;iderations to alarm our con&s;cien|ces? Why &s;o many cur&s;es and ble&s;&s;ings to rou&s;e our fears, and animate our hopes? Surely, it is rea&s;onable and fit we &s;hould exert the&s;e powers of our nature, or &s;uch rea&s;ons to engage their exertment would never have been pre&s;ented to us. Shall God &s;et before our view his law, in all its &s;trictne&s;s and terror, on purpo&s;e that it might be a "&s;chool-ma&s;ter" to teach us our abound|ing &s;infulne&s;s and guilt, and &s;hew us the ab&s;olute need we &s;tand in of the Savior he has provided for us; and we, at the &s;ame time, take no care, make u&s;e of no endeavours to learn, from this in|&s;tructor, the undone &s;tate we are in as &s;inners, that we may be in a proper di&s;po&s;ition to look out for help in the mercy of God thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t? Shall God reveal to us the hope of the go&s;pel, the all-&s;ufficiency of Chri&s;t as a redeemer, the ful|ne&s;s of merit and grace there is in him, his ability and readine&s;s to &s;ave even the chief of &s;inners, and we remain unmoved under the&s;e amazing di&s;coveries of his love and pity, and &s;et down ea&s;ie without doing any thing at all that we may par|take of the benefits of redeeming grace? Shall God apply to every faculty he has endow'd us with, every principle of action in our nature; omiting nothing we can mention, nothing we can conceive of, that is adapted to work upon rea&s;on|able creatures, and we continue notwith&s;tanding indolent and inactive? Tis infinitely ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e it fit it &s;hould be &s;o. And, in truth, we are &s;o con&s;tituted, that it can't be &s;o; tis impo&s;&s;i|ble
<PB N="342" REF="009925_0347_0F7B3C2A14CDF938">
we &s;hould &s;it &s;till, and do nothing, unle&s;s we are &s;tupidly ignorant, or as &s;tupidly in&s;en&s;ible.</P>
<P>SOME, I know, under the pretence of being jealous for the honor of Chri&s;t and grace, have repre&s;ented all exertments of our's as hurtful, rather than u&s;eful; and in&s;tead of urging &s;inners to "&s;trive to enter in at the &s;trait gate", rather tell them their own endeavours are u&s;ele&s;s, and it better becomes them to wait inactive till God &s;hall plea&s;e powerfully to work the work of faith in them. But this is to run from one extreme to another, and to guard again&s;t one danger, by geting into another as truly fatal. We cannot be too much concern'd, that Chri&s;t and grace may have their due glory in the affair of our &s;al|vation; but under the notion of exalting Chri&s;t, and magnifying grace, we mu&s;t not reflect di&s;honor on the wi&s;dom of God, who has &s;o contrived the plan of life, as to make our exertments nece&s;&s;ary, tho' in the proper place of &s;ubordination. If there is danger, le&s;t, if men are put upon doing, they &s;hould tru&s;t to their doings to the di&s;honor of Chri&s;t; is there not danger likewi&s;e, if they are in&s;tructed to &s;it idle and do nothing, le&s;t they &s;hould mi&s;s of grace, die without an intere&s;t in Chri&s;t, and peri&s;h in another world? The pro|per method here is, not to &s;uppo&s;e that men mu&s;t be inactive, but to &s;hew them how their activity may be &s;o &s;ubordinated to the grace of God, &amp; the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, as that they may harmo|ni&s;e with each other in the great affair of eternal life; which is what I have endeavoured to do in the preceding di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="343" REF="009925_0348_0F7B3C2A810421C0">AND now, as the conclu&s;ion of what we have heard, let us endeavour to entertain in our minds ju&s;t conceptions of the &s;cheme of God, with refer|ence to eternal life. Let us adore and magnifie that unmerited love, and free favor of his, which have made it obtainable by the &s;inful &s;ons of men. Let us admire his wi&s;dom in contriving &s;o wonderful an expedient, for the be&s;towment of it in a way honorary to his perfections and go|vernment, as the meritorious righteou&s;ne&s;s of his &s;on Je&s;us Chri&s;t.

Nei|ther the grace of God, nor the merits of Chri&s;t, take away the nece&s;&s;ity, or the &s;uitablene&s;s, of our own exertions in the bu&s;ine&s;s of attaining to life; and tis &s;o far from honoring the grace of God, or the merits of the redeemer, to &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch a thing, that it really ca&s;ts reproach upon them both.

Men may, tis true, place their own doings in the room of Chri&s;t, or divine grace; and &s;o they may, under the notion of exalting Chri&s;t, and magnifying grace, reject all exertions of their's as u&s;ele&s;s, and to no purpo&s;e: But, in either of the&s;e ca&s;es, di&s;honor is done to the redeemer, &amp; that grace of God which can never be incon&s;i&s;tent with our own endea|vours, duly &s;ubordinated.

give God the glory of his grace, in making life at|tainable; and Chri&s;t, the glory of his worthine&s;s, in depending on that for the be&s;towment of it, let us labor and &s;trive, that we may be made meet for this great &amp; ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary ble&s;&s;ing; as firmly believing, we can have no good rea&s;on to expect to be made thus meet for it, if we &s;it &s;till and do nothing: Whereas, if we exert our|&s;elves with zeal and vigor, in the u&s;e of appoint|ed means, we may encourage our&s;elves to hope, that God, for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, will begin, maintain, and carry on that work of grace in our &s;ouls, which will finally end in that life of glory, in the heavenly world, which &s;hall be eternal. GOD grant this may be the happy portion of us all for his mercy's &s;ake, in Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord!</P>
