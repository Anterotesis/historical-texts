<HEAD><HI>IN CONGRESS, JULY 4, 1776.</HI> A <HI>DECLARATION</HI> by the <HI>REPRESENTATIVES</HI> of the <HI>UNITED STATES</HI> of <HI>AMERICA,</HI> in <HI>General Congre&s;s A&s;&s;embled.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHEN in the cour&s;e of human e|vents, it becomes nece&s;&s;ary for one people to di&s;&s;olve the politi|cal bands which have connected them with another, and to a&s;&s;ume among the powers of the earth, the &s;eparate and equal &s;tation to which the laws of nature and of nature's God entitle them, a decent re&s;pect to the o|pinions of mankind requires that they &s;hould declare the cau&s;es which impel them to the &s;eparation.</P>
<P>We hold the&s;e truths to be &s;elf-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalien|able rights, that among the&s;e are life, liberty and the pur&s;uit of happine&s;s.&mdash;That to &s;ecure the&s;e rights governments are in&s;tituted among men, deriving their ju&s;t powers from the
<PB N="4" REF="018828_0003_0FA81FAC8CA997A8">
con&s;ent of the governed, that whenever any form of government becomes de&s;tructive of the&s;e ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to aboli&s;h it, and to in&s;titute new government, laying its foundation on &s;uch principles, and organizing its powers in &s;uch form as to them &s;hall &s;eem mo&s;t likely to effect their &s;afety and happine&s;s. Prudence indeed will dictate, that governments long e&s;tabli&s;h|ed &s;hould not be changed for light and tran|&s;ient cau&s;es, and accordingly all experience hath &s;hewn, that mankind are more di&s;po&s;ed to &s;uffer, while evils are &s;ufferable, than to right them&s;elves by aboli&s;hing the forms to which they are accu&s;tomed. But when a long train of abu&s;es and u&s;urpations pur&s;uing in|variably the &s;ame object, evinces a de&s;ign to reduce them under ab&s;olute de&s;poti&s;m, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off &s;uch government, and to provide new guards for their future &s;ecurity. Such has been the pati|ent &s;ufferance of the colonies; and &s;uch is now the nece&s;&s;ity which con&s;trains them to alter their former &s;y&s;tem of government. The hi&s;tory of the pre&s;ent King of Great-Britain, is a hi&s;tory of repeated injuries and u&s;urpati|ons, all having in direct object, the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of an ab&s;olute tyranny over the&s;e &s;tates. To prove this let facts be &s;ubmitted to a can|did world.</P>
<P>He has refu&s;ed his a&s;&s;ent to laws, the mo&s;t
<PB N="5" REF="018828_0004_0FA81FAD4C498DB8">
whole&s;ome and nece&s;&s;ary for the public good.</P>
<P>He has forbidden his Governors to pa&s;s laws of immediate and pre&s;&s;ing importance, unle&s;s &s;u&s;pended in their operation till his a&s;|&s;ent &s;hould be obtained; and when &s;o &s;u&s;|pended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.</P>
<P>He has refu&s;ed to pa&s;s other laws for the accommodation of large di&s;tricts of people, unle&s;s tho&s;e people would relinqui&s;h the right of repre&s;entation in the legi&s;lature; a right ine&s;timable to them, and formidable to ty|rants only.</P>
<P>He has called together legi&s;lative bodies at places unu&s;ual, uncomfortable, and di&s;tant from the depo&s;itory of their public records, for the &s;ole purpo&s;e of fatiguing them in|to compliance with his mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>He has di&s;&s;olved repre&s;entative hou&s;es re|peatedly, for oppo&s;ing with manly firmne&s;s his inva&s;ions on the rights of the people.</P>
<P>He has refu&s;ed for a long time, after &s;uch di&s;&s;olutions, to cau&s;e others to be elected; whereby the legi&s;lative powers, incapable of annihilation, have returned to the people at large, for their exerci&s;e; the &s;tate remaining in the mean time expo&s;ed to all the dangers of inva&s;ion from without, and convul&s;ions within.</P>
<P>He has endeavoured to prevent the popu|lation of the&s;e States; for that purpo&s;e ob|&s;tructing
<PB N="6" REF="018828_0005_0FA81FAE1215DA30">
the laws for naturalization of fo|reigners; refu&s;ing to pa&s;s others to encourage their migrations hither, and rai&s;ing the con|ditions of new appropriations of lands.</P>
<P>He has ob&s;tructed the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, by refu&s;ing his a&s;&s;ent to laws for e|&s;tabli&s;hing judiciary powers.</P>
<P>He has made judges dependent on his will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their &s;alaries.</P>
<P>He has erected a multitude of new offices, and &s;ent hither &s;warms of officers to harra&s;s our people, and eat out their &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P>He has kept among us, in times of peace, &s;tanding armies, without the con&s;ent of our legi&s;latures.</P>
<P>He has affected to render the military in|dependent of, and &s;uperior to, the civil pow|er.</P>
<P>He has combined with others to &s;ubject us to a juri&s;diction foreign to our con&s;tituti|on, and unacknowledged by our laws; giv|ing his a&s;&s;ent to their acts of pretended legi&s;|lation,</P>
<P>For quartering large bodies of troops a|mong us:</P>
<P>For protecting them, by a mock trial, from puni&s;hment for any murders which they &s;hould commit on the inhabitants of the&s;e &s;tates:</P>
<P>For cutting off our trade with all parts of the world:</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="018828_0006_0FA81FAED2079DA8">For impo&s;ing taxes on us without our con|&s;ent:</P>
<P>For depriving us in many ca&s;es, of the be|nefits of trial by jury:</P>
<P>For tran&s;porting us beyond &s;eas to be tries for pretended offences:</P>
<P>For aboli&s;hing the free &s;y&s;tem of Engli&s;h laws in a neighbouring province, e&s;tabli&s;hing therein an arbitrary government, and en|larging its boundaries, &s;o as to render it at once an example and fit in&s;trument for intro|ducing the &s;ame ab&s;olute rule into the&s;e Co|lonies:</P>
<P>For taking away our Charters, aboli&s;h|ing our mo&s;t valuable laws, and altering fundamentally the forms of our govern|ments:</P>
<P>For &s;u&s;pending our own legi&s;latures, and declaring them&s;elves inve&s;ted with power to legi&s;late for us in all ca&s;es what&s;oever.</P>
<P>He has abdicated government here, by declaring us out of his protection, and wa|ging war again&s;t us.</P>
<P>He has plundered our &s;eas, ravaged our coa&s;ts, burnt our towns, and de&s;troyed the lives of our people.</P>
<P>He is, at this time, tran&s;porting large ar|mies of foreign mercenaries to compleat the works of death, de&s;olation and tyranny, al|ready begun with circum&s;tances of cruelty and perfidy, &s;carcely paralleled in the mo&s;t
<PB N="8" REF="018828_0007_0FA81FAFC1D16C70">
barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the head of a civilized nation.</P>
<P>He has con&s;trained our fellow citizens, taken captive on the high &s;eas, to bear arms again&s;t their country, to become the executioners of their friends and brethren, or to fall them&s;elves by their hands.</P>
<P>He has excited dome&s;tic in&s;urrections a|mong us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the mercile&s;s Indian &s;avages, who&s;e known rule of war|fare is an undi&s;tingui&s;hed de&s;truction, of all ages, &s;exes and conditions.</P>
<P>In every &s;tage of the&s;e oppre&s;&s;ions we have petitioned for redre&s;s, in the mo&s;t hum|ble terms: Our repeated petitions have been an&s;wered only by repeated injury. A Prince, who&s;e character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.</P>
<P>Nor have we been wanting in attentions to our Briti&s;h brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their le|gi&s;lature to extend an unwarrantable juris|diction over us. We have reminded them of the circum&s;tances of our emigration and &s;ettle|ment here. We have appealed to their na|tive ju&s;tice and magnanimity and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to di&s;avow the&s;e u&s;urpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connection
<PB N="9" REF="018828_0008_0FA81FB1399DE890">
and corre&s;pondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of ju&s;tice and of con&s;angui|nity. We mu&s;t, therefore, aquie&s;ce in the nece&s;&s;ity which denounces our &s;eparation, and hold them as we hold the re&s;t of man|kind, enemies in war; in peace, friends.</P>
<P>We, therefore, the Repre&s;entatives of the United States in General Congre&s;s a&s;&s;embled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the World, for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the name and by the authority of the good people of the&s;e colonies, &s;olemnly pub|li&s;h and declare, That the&s;e United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, FREE and INDEPENDENT STATES; that they are ab&s;ol|ved from all allegiance to the Briti&s;h crown, and that all political connection between them and the &s;tate of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally di&s;&s;olved; and that as free and Independent States, they have full pow|er to levy war, conclude peace, contract alli|ances, e&s;tabli&s;h commerce, and to do all o|ther acts and things which Independent States may of right do. And for the &s;up|port of this declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes, and our &s;acred honour.</P>

<P>THE Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King, and the Thirteen United States of North-America, to wit, New-Hamp&s;hire, Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, Rhode-I&s;land, Connecticut, New York, New-Jer|&s;ey, Penn&s;ylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North-Carolina, South-Carolina, and Georgia, willing to fix in an equitable and permanent manner, the rules which ought to be followed relative to the corre&s;pond|ence and commerce which the two parties de&s;ire to e&s;ta|bli&s;h between their re&s;pective countries, &s;tates and &s;ub|jects; his mo&s;t chri&s;tian maje&s;ty and the &s;aid united &s;tates have judged that the &s;aid end could not be better obtained, than by taking for the ba&s;is of their agreement, the mo&s;t perfect equality and reciprocity, and by care|fully avoiding all tho&s;e burthen&s;ome preferences which are u&s;ually &s;ources of debate, embarra&s;&s;ment and di&s;con|tent; by leaving al&s;o &s;uch party at liberty to make re|&s;pecting navigation and commerce, tho&s;e interior regula|tions

<P>THE Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King, and the Thirteen United States of North-America, to wit&punc; New-Hamp|&s;hire, Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay, Rhode-I&s;land, Connecticut, New-York, New-Jer&s;ey, Penn&s;ylvania, Delaware, Ma|ryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South-Carolina, and Georgia, having this day concluded a Treaty of Amity and Commerce, for the reciprocal advantage of their &s;ubjects and citizens, have thought it nece&s;&s;ary to take into con&s;ideration the means of &s;trengthening tho&s;e en|gagements, and of rendering them u&s;eful to the &s;afety and tranquility of the two parties; particularly in ca&s;e Great-Britain, in re&s;entment of that connection, and of the good corre&s;pondence which is the object of

And his Maje&s;ty and the &s;aid United States having re|&s;olved in that ca&s;e, to join their councils and efforts again&s;t the enterprizes of their common enemy.</P>
<P>The re&s;pective plenipotentiaries empowered to concert the clau&s;es and conditions proper to fulfil the &s;aid inten|tions, have, after the mo&s;t mature deliberation, conclud|ed and determined on the following articles:</P>
<P>ARTICLE I.</P>
<P>IF war &s;hould break out between France and Great-Britain, during the continuance of the pre&s;ent war between the United States and England, his Maje&s;ty and the &s;aid United States &s;hall make it a com|mon cau&s;e, and aid each other mutually with their good offices, their coun&s;els and their forces, according to the exigence of conjunctures, as becomes good and faith|ful allies.</P>
<P>Art. 2. The e&s;&s;ential and direct end of the pre&s;ent de|fen&s;ive alliance is, to maintain effectually the liberty, &s;overeignty and independence ab&s;olute and unlimited, of the &s;aid United States, as well in matters of government as of commerce.</P>
<P>Art. 3. The two contracting parties &s;hall, each on his own part, and in the manner it may judge mo&s;t pro|per, make all the efforts in its power again&s;t their com|mon enemy, in order to attain the end propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Art. 4. The contracting parties agree, that in ca&s;e either of them &s;hould form any particular enterprize in which the concurrence of the other may be de&s;ired, the party who&s;e concurrence is de&s;ired, &s;hall readily and with good faith join to act in concert for that purpo&s;e, as far as circum&s;tances and its own particular &s;ituation will per|mit, and in that ca&s;e, they &s;hall regulate by a particular convention, the quantity and kind of &s;uccour to be fur|ni&s;hed, and the time and manner of its being brought
<PB N="28" REF="018828_0027_0FA81FC30EE3EB90">
into action, as well as the advantages which are to be in compen&s;ation.</P>
<P>Art. 5. If the United States &s;hould think fit to at|tempt the reduction of the Briti&s;h power, remaining in the northern parts of America, or the i&s;lands of Ber|mudas, tho&s;e countries or i&s;lands, in ca&s;e of &s;ucce&s;s, &s;hall be confederated with, or dependent upon &s;aid Uni|ted States.</P>
<P>Art. 6. The Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King renounces forever the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the i&s;lands of Bermudas, as well as of any part of the continent of North-America, which be|fore the treaty of Paris, in 1763, or in virtue of that treaty, were acknowledged to belong to the crown of Great-Britain, or to the United States, heretofore cal|led Briti&s;h colonies, or which are at this time, or have lately been under the power of the King and Crown of Great Britain.</P>
<P>Art. 7. If his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty &s;hall think pro|per to attack any of the i&s;lands &s;ituated in the Gulph of Mexico, or near that Gulph, which are at pre&s;ent under the power of Great-Britain, all the &s;aid i&s;les, in ca&s;e of &s;ucce&s;s, &s;hall appertain to the crown of France.</P>
<P>Art. 8. Neither of the two parties &s;hall conclude ei|ther truce or peace with Great Britain, without the for|mal con&s;ent of the other fir&s;t obtained; and they mutu|ally engage not to lay down their arms, until the indpen|dence of the United States &s;hall have been formally or tacitly a&s;&s;ured, by the treaty or treaties that &s;hall termi|nate the war.</P>
<P>Art. 9. The contracting parties declare, that being re&s;olved to fulfil each on its own part, the clau&s;es and conditions of the pre&s;ent treaty of alliance, according to its own power and circum&s;tances, there &s;hall be no after claim of compen&s;ation, on one &s;ide or the other, what|ever may be the event of the war.</P>
<P>Art. 10. The Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King and the United States agree, to invite or admit other powers, who may have received injuries from England to make common cau&s;e with them, and to accede to the pre&s;ent alliance,
<PB N="29" REF="018828_0028_0FA81FC3D4596578">
under &s;uch conditions as &s;hall be freely agreed to, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">+tled between all the parties.</P>
<P>Art. 11. The two parties guarantee mutually from the pre&s;ent time and for ever, again&s;t all other powers, to wit, The United States to his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;|ty, the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the crown of France in America, as well as tho&s;e which it may acquire by the future treaty of peace; and his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty guarantees on his part to the United States, their liber|ty, &s;overeignty and independence, ab&s;olute and unlimit|ted, as well in matters of government as commerce, and al&s;o their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and the additions or conque&s;ts, that their confederation may obtain during the war, from any of the dominions now or heretofore po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by Great-Britain in North-America; conformable to the fifth and &s;ixth articles above written, the whole as their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion &s;hall be fixed and a&s;&s;ured to the &s;aid &s;tates, at the moment of the ce&s;&s;ation of their pre&s;ent war with England.</P>
<P>Art. 12. In order to fix more preci&s;ely the &s;en&s;e and application of the preceding article, the contracting par|ties declare, that in ca&s;e of a rupture between France and England, the reciprocal guarantee declared in the &s;aid article, &s;hall have its full force and effect, the mo|ment &s;uch war &s;hall break out; and if &s;uch rupture &s;hall not take place, the mutual obligations of the &s;aid gua|rantee, &s;hall not commence until the moment of the ce&s;|&s;ation of the pre&s;ent war, between the United States and England, &s;hall have a&s;certained their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>Art. 13. The pre&s;ent treaty &s;hall be ratified on both &s;ides, and the ratifications &s;hall be exchanged in the &s;pace of &s;ix months, or &s;ooner, if po&s;&s;ible.</P>

<P>ART. II. Upon con&s;ideration, however, that the payment of &s;o large a capital at one &s;tipulated period, namely, the 1&s;t of Janu|ary,
<PB N="35" REF="018828_0034_0FA81FCA8B7FC578">
1788, may be exceedingly inconvenient to the Finances of the Congre&s;s of the United States, and that it might perhaps be even im|practicable, it has plea&s;ed his Maje&s;ty on that account, to relea&s;e them from the tenor of tho&s;e receipts given by their Mini&s;ter for the eighteen millions of livres Tournois, mentioned in the preceding article; and he has con&s;ented that the reimbur&s;ement of the capital in ready money to his Royal Trea&s;u|ry, &s;hall be made in twelve equal payments, of 1,500,000 livres each, and in twelve years, to begin the third year after the peace.</P>

<P>ART. IV. The payment of the &s;aid 18,000,000 of livres &s;hall be made in ready

<P>ART. XIII. And that more effectual care may be taken for &s;ecurity of &s;ubjects and people of either party, that they do not &s;uffer mole&s;tation from the ve&s;&s;els of war, or privateers of the other party, it &s;hall be forbidden to all commanders of ve&s;&s;els of war, and other armed ve&s;&s;els of the &s;aid States-General of the United Netherlands, and the &s;aid United States of America, as well as to all their officers, &s;ubjects and people, to give any offence or do any damage to tho&s;e of the other party: and if they act to the contrary, they &s;hall be upon the fir&s;t complaint which &s;hall be made of it, being found guilty after a

<P>ART. XIV.

<P>Art. 11. In order to avoid and prevent on both &s;ides all di&s;putes and di&s;cords, it is agreed that in ca&s;e one of the parties &s;hall be engaged in a war, the &s;hips and ve&s;|&s;els belonging to the &s;ubjects or inhabitants of the other &s;hall be furni&s;hed with &s;ea-letters or pa&s;&s;ports, expre&s;&s;ing the name, property and port of the ve&s;&s;el, and al&s;o the name and place of abode of the ma&s;ter or commander of the &s;aid ve&s;&s;el, in order that it may thereby appear that the &s;aid ve&s;&s;el really and truly belongs to the &s;ubjects of the one or the other party.&mdash;The&s;e pa&s;&s;ports which &s;hall be drawn up in good and due form, &s;hall be renewed e|very time the ve&s;&s;el returns home in the cour&s;e of the year.

<P>Art. 12. Although the ve&s;&s;els of the one and the other party may navigate freely and with all &s;afety, as is explained in the 7th article, they &s;hall neverthele&s;s be bound at all times when required, to exhibit as well on the high &s;eas as in port, their pa&s;&s;ports and certificates a|bove-mentioned. And not having contraband merchan|dize on board for an enemy's port, they may freely and without hindrance pur&s;ue their voyage to the place of their de&s;tination.

<P><PB N="63" REF="018828_0062_0FA81FE65BBD2688">Art. 13. If on producing the &s;aid certificates, it be di&s;covered, that the ve&s;&s;el carries &s;ome of the goods which are declared to be prohibited or contraband, and which are con&s;igned to an enemy's port, it &s;hall not how|ever be lawful to break up the hatches of &s;uch &s;hips, not to open any che&s;t, coffers, packs, ca&s;ks or ve&s;&s;els, nor to remove the &s;malle&s;t part of the merchandizes, until the cargo has been landed in the pre&s;ence of officers appoint|ed for the purpo&s;e, and until an inventory thereof has been taken; nor &s;hall it be lawful to &s;ell, exchange or a|lienate the cargo or any part thereof, until legal proce&s;s &s;hall have been had again&s;t the prohibited merchandizes, and &s;entences &s;hall have pa&s;&s;ed, declaring them liable to confi&s;cation; &s;aving, neverthele&s;s, as well the &s;hips them|&s;elves, as the other merchandizes, which &s;hall have been found therein, which by virtue of this pre&s;ent treaty, are to be e&s;teemed free, and which are not to be detained on pretence of their having been loaded with prohibited merchandize, and much le&s;s confi&s;cated as lawful prize.

When a ve&s;&s;el is taken and brought into any of the ports of the contracting parties, if upon examination &s;he be found to be loaded only with merchandizes declared to be free, the owner or he who has made the prize &s;hall be bound to pay all co&s;ts and damages to the ma&s;ter of the ve&s;&s;el un|ju&s;tly detained.</P>
<P>Art. 14. It is likewi&s;e agreed that whatever &s;hall be found to be laden by the &s;ubjects of either of the two contracting parties on a &s;hip belonging to the enemies of the other party, the whole effects, although not of the number of tho&s;e declared contraband, &s;hall be confi&s;ca|ted as if they belonged to the enemy, excepting never|thele&s;s &s;uch goods and merchandizes as were put on board before the declaration of war, and even &s;ix months after

<P>Art. 18. If it &s;hould happen that the two contracting parties &s;hould be engaged in a war at the &s;ame time, with a common enemy, the following points &s;hall be ob&s;erved on both &s;ides.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. If the &s;hips of one of the two nations retaken by the privateers of the other, have not been in the power of the enemy more than twenty-four hours, they &s;hall be re&s;tored to the original owner on payment of one third of the value of the &s;hip and cargo. If on the contrary, the ve&s;&s;el retaken has been more than twenty-four hours in the power of the enemy, it &s;hall belong wholly to him who has retaken it.</P>
<P N="2">2d. In ca&s;e, during the interval of twenty-four hours, a ve&s;&s;el be retaken by a man of war of either of the two parties, it &s;hall be re&s;tored to the original owner on pay|ment of a thirtieth part of the value of the ve&s;&s;el and car|go,
<PB N="66" REF="018828_0065_0FA81FE88D2BE708">
and a tenth part of it has been retaken after the twen|ty-four hours, which &s;ums &s;hall be di&s;tributed as a grati|fication among the crew of the men of war that &s;hall have made the recapture.</P>
<P N="3">3d. The prizes made in manner above-mentioned, &s;hall be re&s;tored to the owners after proof made of the property, upon giving &s;ecurity for the part coming to him who has recovered the ve&s;&s;el from the hands of the enemy.</P>
<P N="4">4th. The men of war and privateers of the two nati|ons &s;hall reciprocally be admitted with their prizes into each others ports; but the prizes &s;hall not be unloaded or &s;old there until the legality of a prize made by Swe|di&s;h &s;hips &s;hall have been determined according to the laws and regulations e&s;tabli&s;hed in Sweden, as al&s;o that of the prizes made by American ve&s;&s;els, &s;hall have been determined according to the laws and regulations e&s;ta|bli&s;hed by the United States of America.</P>
<P N="5">5th.

<P>Art. 19.

<P>Art. 20. In ca&s;e any ve&s;&s;el belonging to either of the two States, or to their &s;ubjects, &s;hall be &s;tranded, &s;hip|wrecked, or &s;uffer any other damage on the coa&s;ts or un|to the dominion of either of the parties, all aid and a&s;|&s;i&s;tance

&s;hall be given to the per&s;ons &s;hipwrecked, or who may be in danger thereof, and pa&s;&s;ports &s;hall be granted to them to &s;ecure their return to their own country. The &s;hips and merchandizes wrecked, or their proceeds, if the effects have been &s;old, being claimed in a year and a day by the owners or their attorney, &s;hall be re&s;tored, on their paying the co&s;ts of &s;alvage, conformable to the laws and cu&s;toms of the two nations.</P>
<P>Art. 21. When the Subjects and inhabitants of the two parties, with their ve&s;&s;els, whether they be public and equipped for war, or private, employed in com|merce, &s;hall be forced by tempe&s;t, by pur&s;uit of priva|teers and of enemies, or by any other urgent nece&s;&s;ity, to retire and enter any of the rivers, bays, roads or ports of either of the two parties, they &s;hall be received and treat|ed with all humanity and politene&s;s, and they &s;hall en|joy all friend&s;hip, protection, and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and they &s;hall be at liberty to &s;upply them&s;elves with refre&s;h|ments, provi&s;ions, and every thing nece&s;&s;ary for their &s;u&s;tenance, for the repair of their ve&s;&s;els, and for con|tinuing their voyage; provided always, that they pay a rea&s;onable price, and they &s;hall not in any manner be detained or hindred from &s;ailing out of the &s;aid ports or roads, but they may retire and depart when and as they plea&s;e without any ob&s;tacle or hindrance.</P>
<P>Art. 22. In order to favour commerce on both &s;ides as much as po&s;&s;ible, it is agreed, that in ca&s;e a war &s;hould break out between the &s;aid two nations, which God for|bid, the term of nine months, after the declaration of war, &s;hall be allowed to the merchants and &s;ubjects re&s;|pectively on one &s;ide, and the other, in order that they may withdraw with their effects and moveables, which they &s;hall be at liberty to carry off or to &s;ell where they plea&s;e, without the lea&s;t ob&s;tacle; nor &s;hall any &s;eize their effects and much le&s;s their per&s;ons during the &s;aid nine months, but on the contrary, pa&s;&s;ports which &s;hall be valid for a time nece&s;&s;ary for their return, &s;hall be given them for their ve&s;&s;els and the effects which they &s;hall be willing to carry with them. And if any thing is taken from them, or if any injury is done to them by

one of the parties, their people and &s;ubjects, during the term above pre&s;cribed, full and entire &s;atisfaction &s;hall be made to them on that account.

<P>Art. 23. No &s;ubject of the King of Sweden &s;hall take a commi&s;&s;ion or letters of marque, for arming any ve&s;&s;el to act as a privateer again&s;t the United States of Ameri|ca, or any of them, or again&s;t the &s;ubjects, people or inhabitants of the &s;aid United States, or any of them, or again&s;t the property of the inhabitants of the &s;aid States, from any Prince or State whatever, with whom the &s;aid United States &s;hall be at war.

And if any per&s;on of either nation &s;hall take &s;uch commi&s;&s;ions or letters of marque, he &s;hall be puni&s;hed as a pirate.</P>
<P>Art. 24. The ve&s;&s;els of the &s;ubjects of either of the parties coming upon any of the coa&s;ts belonging to the other, but not willing to enter into part, or being en|tered into port, and not willing to unload their cargoes, or to break bulk, &s;hall not be obliged to do it, but on the contrary &s;hall enjoy all the franchi&s;es and exempti|ons which are granted by the rules &s;ub&s;i&s;ting with re&s;|pect to that object.</P>
<P>Art. 25. When a ve&s;&s;el belonging to the &s;ubjects and inhabitants of either of the parties, &s;ailing on the high &s;ea, &s;hall be met by a &s;hip of war or privateer of the other, the &s;aid &s;hip of war or privateer, to avoid all di&s;order, &s;hall remain out of cannon &s;hot, but may always &s;end their boat to the merchant &s;hip, and cau&s;e two or three men to go on board of her, to whom the ma&s;ter or com|mander of the &s;aid ve&s;&s;el &s;hall exhibit his pa&s;&s;port, &s;tat|ing the property of the ve&s;&s;el, and when the &s;aid ve&s;&s;el &s;hall have exhibited her pa&s;&s;port, &s;he &s;hall be at liberty

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE great object for which I had the honor to hold an appointment in the &s;ervice of my coun|try being accompli&s;hed, I am now preparing to re&s;ign it into the hands of Congre&s;s, and to return to that dome&s;tic retirement, which, it is well known, I left with the greate&s;t reluctance&mdash;a retirement for which I have never cea&s;ed to &s;igh, through a long and painful ab|&s;ence, and in which (remote from the noi&s;e and trouble of the world) I meditate to pa&s;s the remainder of life in a &s;tate of undi&s;turbed repo&s;e: But before I carry this re|&s;olution into effect, I think it a duty incumbent on me, to make this my la&s;t official communication&mdash;to con|gratulate you on the glorious events which Heaven has been plea&s;ed to produce in our favour; to offer my &s;en|timents re&s;pecting &s;ome important &s;ubjects, which appear to me to be intimately connected with the tranquility of the United States; to take my leave of your Excellency as a public character; and to give my final ble&s;&s;ing to that country, in who&s;e &s;ervice I have &s;pent the prime of my life; for who&s;e &s;ake I have con&s;umed &s;o many anxious days and watchful nights; and who&s;e happine&s;s being extremely dear to me, will always con&s;titute no incon&s;i|derable part of my own.</P>
<P>Impre&s;&s;ed with the livelie&s;t &s;en&s;ibility on this plea&s;ing occa&s;ion, I will claim the indulgence of dilating the more copiou&s;ly on the &s;ubject of our mutual felicitation. When
<PB N="86" REF="018828_0085_0FA81FFF1F6E8240">
we con&s;ider the magnitude of the prize we contended for, the doubtful nature of the conte&s;t, and the favour|able manner in which it has terminated, we &s;hall find the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible rea&s;on for gratitude and rejoicing: This is a theme that will afford infinite delight to every benevolent and liberal mind, whether the event in con|templation be con&s;idered as the &s;ource of pre&s;ent enjoy|ment, or the parent of future happine&s;s&mdash;and we &s;hall have equal occa&s;ion to felicitate our&s;elves on the lot which Providence has a&s;&s;igned us, whether we view it in a na|tural, political, or moral point of light.</P>
<P>The citizens of America, placed in the mo&s;t enviable condition, as the &s;ole lords and proprietors of a va&s;t tract of continent, comprehending all the various &s;oils and cli|mates of the world, and abounding with all the nece&s;&s;a|ries and conveniences of life, are now, by the late &s;atis|factory pacification, acknowledged to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of ab|&s;olute freedom and independency: They are from this period to be con&s;idered as the actors on a mo&s;t con&s;pi|cuous theatre, which &s;eems to be peculiarly de&s;ignated by Providence for the di&s;play of human greatne&s;s and fe|licity. Here they are not only &s;urrounded with every thing which can contribute to the completion of private and dome&s;tic enjoyment, but Heaven has crowned all its other ble&s;&s;ings by giving a fairer opportunity for political happine&s;s, than any other nation has ever been favoured with. Nothing can illu&s;trate the&s;e ob&s;ervations more forcibly, than a recollection of the happy conjuncture of times and circum&s;tances, under which our republic a&s;|&s;umed its rank among the nations. The foundation of our empire was not laid in the gloomy age of ignorance and &s;uper&s;tition, but at an epocha when the rights of mankind were better under&s;tood and more clearly defined than at any former period; the re&s;earches of the human mind, after &s;ocial happine&s;s have been carried to a great extent; the trea&s;ures of knowledge, acquired by the la|bours of Philo&s;ophers, Sages and Legi&s;lators, through a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of years, are laid open for our u&s;e, and their collected wi&s;dom may be happily applied in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of our forms of government; the free cul|tivation
<PB REF="018828_0086_0FA81FFFD07B48B8">
of letters, the unbounded exten&s;ion of commerce, the progre&s;&s;ive refinement of manners, the growing libe|rality of &s;entiment, and above all, the pure and benign light of revelation, have had a meliorating influence on mankind, and encrea&s;ed the ble&s;&s;ings of &s;ociety. At this au&s;picious period the United States came into exi&s;tence as a nation, and if their citizens &s;hould not be complete|ly free and happy, the fault will be entirely their own.</P>
<P>Such is our &s;ituation, and &s;uch are our pro&s;pects; but notwith&s;tanding the cup of ble&s;&s;ing is thus reached out to us; notwith&s;tanding happine&s;s is ours if we have a di&s;po&s;ition to &s;eize the occa&s;ion and make it our own; yet it appears to me, there is an option, &s;till left to the United States of America, that it is in their choice, and depends upon their conduct, whether they will be re|&s;pectable and pro&s;perous, or contemptible and mi&s;erable, as a nation. This is the time of their political probation; this is the moment when the eyes of the whole world are turned upon them: This is the moment to e&s;tabli&s;h or ruin their national character for ever; this is the fa|vourable moment to give &s;uch a tone to our foederal government as will enable it to an&s;wer the ends of its in&s;titution; or this may be the ill-fated moment for re|laxing the powers of the union, and annihilating the ce|ment of the confederation, and expo&s;ing us to become the &s;port of European politics, which may play one &s;tate again&s;t another to prevent their growing importance, and to &s;erve their own intere&s;ted purpo&s;es; for, accor|ding to the &s;y&s;tem of policy the &s;tates &s;hall adopt at this moment, they will &s;tand or fall; and by their con|firmation or lap&s;e it is yet to be decided, whether the revolution mu&s;t ultimately, be con&s;idered as a ble&s;&s;ing or a cur&s;e&mdash; a ble&s;&s;ing or a cur&s;e, not to the pre&s;ent age alone, for with our fate will the de&s;tiny of unborn mil|lions be involved.</P>
<P>With this conviction of the importance of the pre&s;ent cri&s;is, &s;ilence in me would be a crime; I will therefore &s;peak to your Excellency the language of freedom and of &s;incerity without di&s;gui&s;e; I am aware, however, that tho&s;e who differ from me in political &s;entiment may
<PB N="88" REF="018828_0087_0FA820008BAAE488">
perhaps remark, I am &s;tepping out of the proper line of my duty, and they may po&s;&s;ibly a&s;cribe to arrogance or o&s;tentation, what I know is alone the re&s;ult of the pure&s;t intention; but the rectitude of my own heart, which di&s;dains &s;uch unworthy motives, the part I have hither|to acted in life, the determination I have formed of not taking any &s;hare in public bu&s;ine&s;s hereafter, the ardent de&s;ire I feel, and &s;hall continue to manife&s;t, of quietly enjoying in private life, after all the toils of war, the benefits of a wi&s;e and liberal government, will, I flat|ter my&s;elf, &s;ooner or later convince my countrymen, that I could have no &s;ini&s;ter views in delivering, with &s;o little re&s;erve, the opinions contained in this addre&s;s.</P>
<P>There are four things which I humbly conceive are e&s;&s;ential to the well-being, I may even venture to &s;ay, to the exi&s;tence of the United States as an independent power,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. An indi&s;&s;oluble union of the States under one foede|ral head.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. A &s;acred regard to public ju&s;tice.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. The adoption of a proper peace e&s;tabli&s;hment. And,</P>
<P N="4">4thly. The prevalence of that pacific and friendly di&s;po&s;ition among the people of the United States, which will induce them to forget their local prejudices and po|licies, to make tho&s;e mutual conce&s;&s;ions which are re|qui&s;ite to general pro&s;perity, and in &s;ome in&s;tances, to &s;acrifice their individual advantages to the intere&s;t of the community.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the pillars on which the glorious fabric of our independency and national character mu&s;t be &s;up|ported: Liberty is the ba&s;is; and whoever would dare to &s;ap the foundation or overturn the &s;tructure, under whatever &s;pecious pretexts he may attempt it, will merit the bittere&s;t execrations and the &s;evere&s;t puni&s;hment which can be inflicted by his injured country.</P>
<P>On the three fir&s;t articles I will make a few ob&s;erva|tions, leaving the la&s;t to the good &s;en&s;e and &s;erious con|&s;ideration of tho&s;e immediately concerned.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="018828_0088_0FA8200199574248">Under the fir&s;t head, although it may not be nece&s;&s;a|ry or proper for me in this place to enter into a particu|lar di&s;qui&s;ition of the principles of the union, and to take up the great que&s;tion which hath been frequently agitated, whether it be expedient and requi&s;ite for the &s;tates to delegate a larger proportion of power to Con|gre&s;s, or not&mdash;yet it will be a part of my duty and that of every true patriot, to a&s;&s;ert without re&s;erve, and to in&s;i&s;t upon the following po&s;itions: That unle&s;s the &s;tates will &s;uffer Congre&s;s to exerci&s;e tho&s;e prerogatives they are undoubtedly inve&s;ted with by the con&s;titution, every thing mu&s;t very rapidly tend to anarchy and con|fu&s;ion: That it is indi&s;pen&s;able to the happine&s;s of the individual &s;tates, that there &s;hould be lodged &s;omewhere, a &s;upreme power, to regulate and govern the general concerns of the confederate republic, without which the union cannot be of long duration: That there mu&s;t be a faithful and pointed compliance on the part of every &s;tate, with the late propo&s;als and demands of Congre&s;s, or the mo&s;t fatal con&s;equences will en&s;ue: That what|ever mea&s;ures have a tendency to di&s;&s;olve the union, or contribute to violate or le&s;&s;en the &s;overeign authority, ought to be con&s;idered as ho&s;tile to the liberty and inde|pendency of America, and the authors of them treated accordingly: And La&s;tly, that unle&s;s we can be enabled by the concurrence of the States, to participate of the fruits of the revolution, and enjoy the e&s;&s;en|tial benefits of civil &s;ociety, under a form of govern|ment &s;o free and uncorrupted, &s;o happily guarded again&s;t the danger of oppre&s;&s;ion, as has been devi&s;ed and adopt|ed by the articles of confederation; that it will be a &s;ubject of regret that &s;o much blood and trea&s;ure have been lavi&s;hed for no purpo&s;e, that &s;o many &s;ufferings have been encountered without compen&s;ation, and that &s;o many &s;acrifices have been made in vain. Many other con&s;iderations might here be adduced to prove, that with|out an entire conformity to the &s;pirit of the union, we can|not exi&s;t as an independent power&mdash;it will be &s;ufficient for my purpo&s;e to mention but one or two, which &s;eem to me of the greate&s;t importance: It is only in our
<PB N="90" REF="018828_0089_0FA8200401D07E28">
united character as an empire, that our independence is acknowledged, that our power can be regarded, or our credit &s;upported among foreign nations. The treaties of the European powers with the United States of Ameri|ca, will have no validity on a di&s;&s;olution of the union &mdash;we &s;hall be left nearly in a &s;tate of nature; or we may find by our own unhappy experience, that there is a na|tural and nece&s;&s;ary progre&s;&s;ion from the extreme of anar|chy to the extreme, of tyranny, and that arbitrary power <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> mo&s;t ea&s;ily e&s;tabli&s;hed on the ruins of liberty abu&s;ed to licentiou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>As to the &s;econd article which re&s;pects the perfor|mance of public ju&s;tice, Congre&s;s have, in their late addre&s;s to the United States, almo&s;t exhau&s;ted the &s;ub|ject: &mdash;They have explained their ideas &s;o fully; and have enforced the obligations the &s;tates are under to ren|der compleat ju&s;tice to all the public creditors, with &s;o much dignity and energy, that in my opinion no real friend to the honor and independency of America, can he&s;itate a &s;ingle moment re&s;pecting the propriety of com|plying with the ju&s;t and honourable mea&s;ures propo&s;ed: If their arguments do not produce conviction, I know of nothing that will have a greater influence; e&s;pecially when we recollect that the &s;y&s;tem referred to, being the re&s;ult of the collected wi&s;dom of the continent, mu&s;t be e&s;teemed, if not perfect, certainly the lea&s;t objectionable of any that could be devi&s;ed, and that if it &s;hould not be carried into immediate execution, a national bankruptcy, with all its deplorable con&s;equences, will take place be|fore any different plan can po&s;&s;ibly be propo&s;ed and adopted. So pre&s;&s;ing are the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances! and &s;uch is the alternative now offered to the &s;tates!</P>
<P>The ability of the country to di&s;charge the debts which have been incurred in its defence, is not to be doubted&mdash;an inclination, I flatter my&s;elf, will not be wanting; the path of our duty is plain before us: Ho|ne&s;ty will be found, on every experiment, to be the be&s;t and only true policy; let us then as a nation be ju&s;t, let us fulfil the public contracts, which Congre&s;s had un|doubtedly a right to make for the purpo&s;e of carrying on
<PB N="91" REF="018828_0090_0FA82005844A4C10">
the war, with the &s;ame good faith we &s;uppo&s;e our&s;elves bound to perform our private engagements; in the mean time, let an attention to the cheerful performance of their proper bu&s;ine&s;s as individuals, and as members of &s;ociety, be earne&s;tly inculcated on the citizens of Ame|rica; then will they &s;trongthen the hands of government; and be happy under its protection; every one will reap the fruit of his labours; every one will enjoy his own acqui&s;itions without mole&s;tation and without danger.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate of ab&s;olute freedom and perfect &s;ecurity, who will grudge, to yield a very little of his property, to &s;upport the common intere&s;ts of &s;ociety, and en&s;ure the protection of government? Who does not remember the frequent declarations at the commencement of the war, that we &s;hould be compleatly &s;atisfied, if at the ex|pence of one half we could defend the remainder of our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; Where is the man to be found who wi&s;hes to remain indebted for the defence of his own per&s;on and property, to the exertions, the bravery and the blood of others, without making one generous effort to repay the debt of honor and of gratitude? In what part of the continent &s;hall we find any man, or body of men, who would not blu&s;h to &s;tand up and propo&s;e mea&s;ures purpo&s;ely calculated to rob the &s;oldier of his &s;tipend and the public creditor of his due? And were it po&s;&s;ible that &s;uch a flagrant in&s;tance of inju&s;tice could ever hap|pen, would it not excite the general indignation, and tend to bring down upon the authors of &s;uch mea&s;ures, the aggravated vengeance of Heaven? If after all, a &s;pi|rit of di&s;union or a temper of ob&s;tinacy and perver&s;ene&s;s &s;hould manife&s;t it&s;elf in any of the &s;tates; if &s;uch an un|gracious di&s;po&s;ition &s;hould attempt to fru&s;trate all the happy effects that might be expected to &s;low from the union; if there &s;hould be a refu&s;al to comply with the re|qui&s;itions for funds to di&s;charge the annual intere&s;t of the public debts; and if that refu&s;al &s;hould revive again all tho&s;e jealou&s;ies, and produce all tho&s;e evils which are now happily removed. Congre&s;s who have in all their tran&s;actions &s;hewn a great degree of magnanimity and ju&s;tice, will &s;tand ju&s;tified in the &s;ight of God and man;
<PB N="92" REF="018828_0091_0FA82005CEFBC120">
and the &s;tate alone which puts it&s;elf in oppo&s;ition to the aggregate wi&s;dom of the continent, and follows &s;uch mi&s;taken and pernicious councils, will be re&s;pon&s;ible for all the con&s;equences.</P>
<P>For my own part, con&s;cious of having acted, while a &s;ervant of the public, in the manner I conceived be&s;t &s;uited to promote the real intere&s;t of my country; having in con&s;equence of my fixed belief, in &s;ome mea&s;ure pledged my&s;elf to the army, that their country, would finally, do them compleat and ample ju&s;tice; and not wi&s;hing to conceal any in&s;tance of my official conduct from the eyes of the world, I have thought proper to tran&s;mit to your Excellency the enclo&s;ed collection of papers relative to the half-pay and commutation granted by Congre&s;s to the officers of the army; from the&s;e com|mutations, my decided &s;entiments will be clearly com|prehended, together with the conclu&s;ive rea&s;ons which induced me, at an early period, to recommend the adop|tion of this mea&s;ure in the mo&s;t earne&s;t and &s;erious man|ner. As the proceedings of Congre&s;s, the army and my|&s;elf, are open to all, and contain, in my opinion, &s;uf|ficient information to remove the prejudices and errors which may have been entertained by any, I think it un|nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay any thing more, than ju&s;t to ob&s;erve that the re&s;olutions of Congre&s;s now alluded to, are un|doubtedly as ab&s;olutely, binding upon the United States as the mo&s;t &s;olemn acts of confederation or legi&s;lation. As to the idea, which I am informed has in &s;ome in|&s;tances prevailed, that the half-pay and commutation are to be regarded merely in the odious light of a pen&s;ion; it ought to be exploded forever&mdash;that provi&s;ion &s;hould be viewed, as it really was, a rea&s;onable compen&s;ation offered by Congre&s;s, at a time when they had nothing el&s;e to give, to the officers of the army for &s;ervices then to be performed&mdash;it was the only means to prevent a total dereliction of the &s;ervice; it was a part of their hire; I may be allowed to &s;ay, it was the price of their blood and your independency; it is therefore more than a common debt: It is a debt of honor; it can never be
<PB N="93" REF="018828_0092_0FA8200693B4D0A8">
con&s;idered as a pen&s;ion or gratuity, nor can be cancelled until it is fairly di&s;charged.</P>
<P>With regard to a di&s;tinction between officers and &s;ol|diers, it is &s;ufficient that the uniform experience of every nation of the world, combined with our own, proves the utility and propriety of the di&s;crimination: Rewards in proportion to the aids the public derives from them, are unque&s;tionably due to all its &s;ervants. In &s;ome lines, the &s;oldiers perhaps have generally had as ample a compen|&s;ation for their &s;ervices, by the large bounties which have been paid to them, as their officers will receive in the propo&s;ed commutation: In others, if be&s;ides the donation of lands, the payment of arrearages of cloathing and wages (in which articles all the component parts of the army mu&s;t be put upon the &s;ame footing) we take into the e&s;timate the bounties many of the &s;oldiers have re|ceived, and the gratuity of one year's full pay, which is promi&s;ed to all, po&s;&s;ibly their &s;ituation (every circum|&s;tance being duly con&s;idered) will not be deemed le&s;s eli|gible than that of the officers; &s;hould a farther reward, however be judged equitable, I will venture to a&s;&s;ert, no one will enjoy greater &s;atisfaction than my&s;elf, on &s;eeing an exemption from taxes for a limited time (which had been petitioned for in &s;ome in&s;tances) or any other ade|quate immunity or compen&s;ation, granted to the brave defenders of their country's cau&s;e: But neither the adop|tion or rejection of this propo&s;ition will in any manner affect, much le&s;s militate again&s;t the act of Congre&s;s, by which they have offered five years full pay, in lieu of the half pay for life which had been before promi&s;ed to the officers of the army.</P>
<P>Before I conclude the &s;ubject of public ju&s;tice, I can|not omit to mention the obligations this country is under to that meritorious cla&s;s of veteran non-commi&s;&s;ioned of|ficers and privates, who have been di&s;charged for inability, in con&s;equence of the re&s;olution of Congre&s;s of the 23d of April, 1782, on an annual pen&s;ion for life; their pecu|liar &s;ufferings, their &s;ingular merits and claims to that provi&s;ion, need only be known, to intere&s;t all the feel|ings
<PB N="94" REF="018828_0093_0FA820074D2C3CF8">
of humanity in their behalf&mdash;nothing but a punctual payment of their annual allowance can re&s;cue them from the mo&s;t complicated mi&s;ery&mdash;and nothing could be a more melancholy and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;ight, than to behold tho&s;e who have &s;hed their blood, or lo&s;t their limbs in the &s;ervice of their country, without a &s;helter, without a friend, and without the means of obtaining any of the nece&s;&s;aries or comforts of life, compelled to beg their dai|ly bread from door to door; Suffer me to recommend tho&s;e of this de&s;cription, belonging to your &s;tate, to the warme&s;t patronage of your Excellency and your Legi&s;|lature.</P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay but a few words on the third to|pic which was propo&s;ed, and which regards particularly the defence of the republic: As there can be little doubt but Congre&s;s will recommend a proper peace e&s;tabli&s;h|ment for the United States, in which a due attention will be paid to the importance of placing the militia of the union upon a regular and re&s;pectable footing&mdash;if this &s;hould be the ca&s;e, I would beg leave to urge the great advantage of it in the &s;tronge&s;t terms: The militia of this county mu&s;t be con&s;idered as the palladium of our &s;ecu|rity, and the fir&s;t effectual re&s;ort in ca&s;e of ho&s;tility&mdash;it is e&s;&s;ential therefore, that the &s;ame &s;y&s;tem &s;hould pervade the whole; that the &s;ame formation and di&s;cipline of the militia of the continent &s;hould be ab&s;olutely uniform, and that the &s;ame &s;pecies of arms, accoutrements and mi|litary apparatus, &s;hould be introduced in every part of the United States: No one who has not learnt it from experience, can conceive the difficulty, expen&s;e and con|fu&s;ion, which re&s;ult from a contrary &s;y&s;tem, or the vague arrangements which have hitherto prevailed.</P>
<P>If in treating of political points, a greater latitude than u&s;ual has been taken in the cour&s;e of this addre&s;s, the importance of the cri&s;is and the magnitude of the object in di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, mu&s;t be my apology. It is, however, nei|ther my wi&s;h or expectation, that the preceding ob&s;erva|tions &s;hould claim any regard, except &s;o far as they &s;hall appear to be dictated by a good intention, con&s;onant to

the immutable rules of ju&s;tice, calculated to produce a liberal &s;y&s;tem of policy, and founded on whatever expe|rience may have been acquired, by a long and clo&s;e at|tention to public bu&s;ine&s;s: Here I might &s;peak with the more confidence from my actual ob&s;ervations, and if it would not &s;well this letter (already too prolix) beyond the bounds I had pre&s;cribed my&s;elf, I could demon&s;trate to every mind open to conviction, that in le&s;s time, and with much le&s;s expence than has been incurred, the war might have been brought to the &s;ame happy conclu&s;ion, if the re&s;ources of the continent could have been proper|ly brought forth; that the di&s;tre&s;&s;es and di&s;appointments which have very often occurred, have, in too many in|&s;tances, re&s;ulted more from a want of energy in the con|tinental government, than a deficiency of means in the particular &s;tates; that the inefficacy of mea&s;ures, ari&s;ing from the want of an adequate authority in the &s;upreme power, from a partial compliance with the requi&s;itions of Congre&s;s in &s;ome of the &s;tates, and from a failure of punctuality in others; while it tended to damp the zeal of tho&s;e which were more willing to exert them&s;elves, &s;erved al&s;o to accumulate the expences of the war, and to fru&s;trate the be&s;t concerted plans; and that the di&s;|couragement occa&s;ioned by the complicated difficulties and embarra&s;&s;ments, in which our affairs were by this means involved, would have long ago produced the di&s;|&s;olution of any army, le&s;s patient, le&s;s virtuous, and le&s;s per&s;evering, than that which I have had the honour to command: But while I mention the&s;e things, which are notorious facts, as the defects of our foederal con&s;titution, particularly in the pro&s;ecution of a war, I beg it may be under&s;tood, that as I have ever taken a plea&s;ure in grate|fully acknowledging the a&s;&s;i&s;tance and &s;upport I have de|rived from every cla&s;s of citizens, &s;o &s;hall I always be happy to do ju&s;tice to the unparalleled exertions of the individual States on many intere&s;ting occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>I have thus freely di&s;clo&s;ed what I wi&s;hed to make known before I &s;urrendered up my public tru&s;t to tho&s;e who committed it to me. The ta&s;k is now accompli&s;hed,

I now bid adieu to your Excellency as the chief magi|&s;trate of your State: At the &s;ame time I bid a la&s;t fare|wel to the cares of office and all the employments of pub|lic life. It remains then to be my final and only reque&s;t, that your Excellency will communicate the&s;e &s;entiments to your Legi&s;lature at their next meeting, and that they may be con&s;idered as the legacy of one who has ardently wi&s;hed, on all occa&s;ions, to be u&s;eful to his country, and who, even in the &s;hade of retirement, will not fail to im|plore the divine benediction upon it.</P>
<P>I now make it my earne&s;t prayer, that God would have you, and the State over which you pre&s;ide, in his holy protection; that he would incline the hearts of the citi|zens to cultivate a &s;pirit of &s;ubordination and obedience to government; to entertain a brotherly affection and love for one another, for their fellow citizens of the United States at large, and particularly for their brethren who have &s;uffered in the field; and finally, that he would mo&s;t graciou&s;ly be plea&s;ed to di&s;po&s;e us all, to do ju&s;tice, to love mercy, and to demean our&s;elves with that chari|ty, humility, and pacific temper of mind, which were the characteri&s;tics of the Divine Author of our ble&s;&s;ed re|ligion, and without an humble imitation of who&s;e exam|ple in the&s;e things, we can never hope to be a happy nation.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I have the honor to be, with e&s;teem and regard, Sir, Your Excellency's mo&s;t obedient &s;ervant, G. WASHINGTON</SIGNED></CLOSER>
