<P>YOU will not tax me with <HI>proclaiming my own Goodne&s;s,</HI> if I de|clare to you that I think, in this Day of Controver&s;y and Heat among us, I have both in my publick and private Conduct (for the general Tenor of it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>&s;tudy'd to do my own Bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI> and made it my Care to <HI>follow th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Things that make for Peace,</HI> with <HI>Edification.</HI> As &s;aith the Scripture, <HI>Therefore the Prudent &s;hall keep Silence in that Time; for it is an evil Time.</HI> Yet &s;aith the true Proverb, <HI>To every Thing there is a Sea&s;on, and a Time to every Purpo&s;e under the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">:</HI>&mdash;<HI>a Time to keep Silence, and a Time to &s;peak.</HI> And in the latter Sea&s;on, I think, none can ju&s;tly be blamed for <HI>&s;peaking,</HI> tho' with Openne&s;s and Freedom, provided they <HI>&s;peak the Words of Truth and Soberne&s;s;</HI> neither <HI>turning a&s;ide to vain Jangling</HI> and <HI>perver&s;e Di&s;puting,</HI> no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>bringing a railing Accu&s;ation,</HI> as the manner of &s;ome is, when two warmly engag'd, and over-eagerly pur&s;uing their Point.&mdash;I am deeply affected, to &s;ee the Spirit of <HI>Envying</HI> and <HI>Strife</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">which brings <HI>Confu|&s;ion and every evil Work<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> ri&s;en to &s;uch a dreadful Height, as at this Junc|ture: Nor would I willingly be the In&s;trument or Occa&s;ion of adding Fewel to this unhappy Fire of Contention, which has done us &s;uch un&s;peakable Mi&s;chief already, has &s;o retarded the &s;ucce&s;sful Progre&s;s of the <HI>glorious Go&s;|pel of the ble&s;&s;ed God,</HI> and given &s;o much <HI>Occa&s;ion to the Adver&s;ary to &s;peak reproachfully.</HI> Behold, <HI>The Tongue of Man is a Fire, a World of Iniquity: a little Member,</HI> yet <HI>an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Evil: The Tongue can no Man tame.</HI> But <HI>with GOD all Things are po&s;&s;ible;</HI> yea, <HI>He is able to &s;ubdue all Things to</HI> HIMSELF.

<P>I mu&s;t freely acknowledge, <HI>Sir,</HI> they were &s;uch Con&s;iderations as the&s;e, which have re&s;train'd me from bearing any Part in the <HI>Paper-War</HI> among us, of &s;o long Continuance. <HI>Nor am I for War,</HI> in my pre&s;ent Undertak|ing; but acted (as I tru&s;t) by the Principles of <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>brotherly Love,</HI> with a View in particular to the &s;atisfying and &s;ettling your Mind in the <HI>Truth,</HI> as well as to the vindicating Mr. <HI>Whitefield'</HI>s Name, in Relation to &s;ome Things &s;ugge&s;ted to his Prejudice, in the late <HI>anonymous</HI> LETTER to him; which, I perceiv'd by you, in our la&s;t Conver&s;ation, had made &s;ome Impre&s;&s;ions on you to his Di&s;advantage, and I &s;u&s;pect, to your own Hurt.&mdash;You may remember, in what Manner you expre&s;&s;ed your free Thoughts to me, concerning that Performance; <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> That the Author's <HI>Arguments</HI> are conclu&s;ive and unan&s;werable, if his <HI>Facts</HI> might be depended on, and the <HI>Grounds</HI> of his Rea&s;oning have no Fallacy attending them.&mdash;This (<HI>Sir</HI>) has put me upon a fre&s;h reading this <HI>Letter.</HI>&mdash;And I mu&s;t confe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s, when I reali&s;e the <HI>high Nature</HI> of the Accu&s;ations here in&s;inuated again&s;t Mr. <HI>W</HI>&mdash;<HI>d,</HI> and when I reflect on the <HI>popular</HI> Dre&s;s the Author appears in, together with the <HI>Effect</HI> his plau&s;ible Piece has already had on you, and the repeated <HI>Challenges</HI> I've heard made upon it, &s;ince I &s;aw you, as if it were the mo&s;t nervous Performance quite deci&s;ive, and not admitting of an An&s;wer; I incline to think an An&s;wer <HI>due</HI> to it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">more perhaps than to any other in the like Kind, that I have &s;een) e&s;pecially to tho&s;e <HI>Parts</HI> of it, that contain Matters not &s;o commonly objected, and which &s;eem to be the prin|cipal Difficulties, that have given Ri&s;e to your pre&s;ent Unea&s;ine&s;s, with re|gard to Mr. <HI>W</HI>&mdash;<HI>d.</HI></P>
<P>For I ob&s;erve, that all the more obvious Topicks of Objection and In|vective again&s;t him, in former U&s;e, being grown quite vulgar and trite, by &s;uch frequent Repetition, the <HI>Author</HI> of the LETTER has &s;truck up cer|tain New-Lights, and invented &s;ome &s;ingular Themes of Declamation, of a &s;pecious Appearance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> dwelling chiefly and fir&s;t upon the&s;e, but more cur&s;orily touching on the others in the Clo&s;e.

as what <HI>you</HI> want an An&s;wer to, I propo&s;e therefore at pre&s;ent to confine my Reflections to <HI>the&s;e;</HI> waving all Remarks on the concluding Pages, and pa&s;&s;ing over what may be exceptionable in the Author's Introduction.</P>
<P>The main Scope of his <HI>Letter</HI> is the Trial of Mr. <HI>Whitefield'</HI>s Spirit, in Point of <HI>Chri&s;tian Simplicity</HI> and <HI>moral Hone&s;ty;</HI> which our Author &s;eems to think not di&s;coverable in &s;ome Parts of his publick Conduct.&mdash;If I know my&s;elf, Sir, I would not be a blind Bigot to any Man, the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t upon Earth; or <HI>have his Per&s;on in Admiration, becau&s;e of Advantage,</HI> in any Re&s;pect: And as for Mr. <HI>W</HI>&mdash;<HI>d,</HI> I think I feel in me a proper Temper to &s;ee Mi&s;takes and Failings in <HI>him</HI> as &s;oon as in another.&mdash;Nor can I but highly approve every due Te&s;timony again&s;t all <HI>Di&s;&s;imulation,</HI> e&s;pecially in &s;acred Affairs; and ju&s;tify the contending for <HI>Simplicity and godly Sincerity,</HI> as an E&s;&s;ential in the Character of a <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> and eminent|ly of a <HI>Mini&s;ter,</HI> who ought to be an <HI>Example to the Flock.</HI> And I mu&s;t acknowledge, if our <HI>Author</HI> carries this Point again&s;t Mr. <HI>W</HI>&mdash;<HI>d,</HI> he will give the mo&s;t thorow Stab to his Name; and mu&s;t &s;hake, if not demo|li&s;h, his Intere&s;t with the unbias'd Part of Mankind.&mdash;But then the U&s;e we &s;hould make of this Reflection, is to treat a Point &s;o delicate, and of &s;uch Importance, with the utmo&s;t Caution to avoid <HI>evil Surmi&s;ings,</HI> and to exemplify that <HI>Charity</HI> which <HI>thinketh no Evil,</HI> which <HI>believeth all Things, hopeth all Things,</HI> for the be&s;t.&mdash;The <HI>Con&s;equence</HI> being &s;o va&s;t, we &s;hould well con&s;ider what <HI>Premi&s;&s;es</HI> we draw it from, that they be good and &s;ound and clear, a &s;ufficient Foundation to &s;upport the heavy Conclu&s;ion. And &s;urely in a Ca&s;e, of this critical Nature and of &s;o much Moment, nothing &s;hort of undoubted <HI>Law</HI> and <HI>Evidence,</HI> nothing &s;hort of inconte&s;tible <HI>Rule</HI> and <HI>Fact,</HI> view'd in the faire&s;t comparative Light, <HI>without Partiality, and without Hypocri&s;y,</HI> can be valid and ju&s;t Grounds to form our Judgment upon. How our <HI>Author</HI> has acquitted him&s;elf in his Trial of Mr. <HI>W</HI>&mdash;<HI>d'</HI>s Ca&s;e, you will know my Opinion by the Sequel of this Review.</P>
<P>The main Thing to be examin'd into, is the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the <HI>Clergy-Sub|&s;criptions</HI> and <HI>Promi&s;es</HI> (made at entring into holy Orders) compar'd with &s;ome late In&s;tances of Mr. <HI>Whitefield'</HI>s Conduct; wherein our <HI>Author</HI> &s;u&s;|pects him guilty of the mo&s;t culpable <HI>Incon&s;i&s;tence,</HI> &s;uch as bewrays <Q><HI>a wicked In&s;incerity,</HI> and <HI>aggravated Prevarication,</HI> to &s;ay no wor&s;e,</Q>&mdash;The&s;e were high Charges indeed, if brought in Form, and need very full and po&s;itive Evidence to gain them Credit with rea&s;onable and impartial Judges. <HI>Again&s;t an Elder receive not an Accu&s;ation, but before two or three Witne&s;&s;es.</HI>&mdash;Aware of this, our <HI>Author</HI> therefore deals little in formal and direct <HI>Accu&s;ations,</HI> but proceeds generally by Way of <HI>Inquiry</HI> and <HI>In&s;inua|tion:</HI> exhibiting his Grounds of <HI>Jealou&s;y,</HI> and calling upon Mr. <HI>W</HI>&mdash;<HI>d</HI> to <HI>clear up his Innocence,</HI> or el&s;e <HI>confe&s;s his Guilt;</HI> though, it appears plain up|on the Face of his Performance, he thinks it's the <HI>latter</HI> only, that he has any Rea&s;on to expect. Whereas, I am per&s;waded, the Gentleman would

<P>Our <HI>Author</HI> fir&s;t &s;ingles out the 26<HI>th</HI> of the 39 <HI>Articles</HI> of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> as what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e &s;hrewdly &s;u&s;pects Mr. <HI>W</HI>&mdash;<HI>d</HI> guilty of having <HI>contra|dicted,</HI> by &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages in one of his printed <HI>Journals,</HI> as recited in the <HI>Letter</HI> before us. And the Gentleman, "to give a <HI>clear View</HI> of the <HI>Difficulty</HI> which he wants to have &s;olv'd," contrives two di&s;tinct <HI>Columns,</HI> for the <HI>Ar|ticle</HI> and the <HI>Extract,</HI> &s;etting the one over again&s;t the other. And fancying (I &s;uppo&s;e) that he now had Mr. <HI>W</HI>&mdash;<HI>d</HI> fa&s;t, to be unavoidably ground as between <HI>two <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> tho' without any Attempt to put them in <HI>Mot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">on</HI>) he leaves him in this critical Situation, pre&s;ently pa&s;&s;ing over to a new Ca&s;e.

<P>I truly wi&s;h, that our <HI>Author</HI> would revi&s;e his <HI>two Columns,</HI> compare and &s;can them with his be&s;t Powers of Critici&s;m, and try if he can fairly make out the lea&s;t real <HI>Contradiction</HI> between them, in any Part, Paragraph, Sen|tence, Lin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, or Word. For my &s;elf, I have try'd all my Skill upon 'em, and am quite at a Lo&s;s where the <HI>Incon&s;i&s;tency</HI> lies.&mdash;Among which of the various <HI>Types</HI> in the <HI>Extract</HI> (or <HI>printed Words</HI> of Mr. <HI>W</HI>&mdash;<HI>d</HI>) we mu&s;t look to find a <HI>Contradiction</HI> to the <HI>Article,</HI> &s;et in Oppo&s;ition to it, the Author has not been &s;o kind as particularly to direct us.

<PB N="7" REF="005594_0006_1026A7E15CE15368">
puzzle a good Genius, to trace out any real <HI>Contradiction</HI> here. Our <HI>Author</HI> indeed &s;eems to draw our Eyes to this Part of the <HI>Extract,</HI> and to indigitate a &s;ingle Pa&s;&s;age, as the <HI>Capital</HI> one, by putting it in great Letters.

<P>You are &s;en&s;ible, Sir, that <HI>Rhetorical</HI> Figures and Flouri&s;hes are allow'd a candid Con&s;truction in all Authors, &s;acred or prophane.

<P>Nor can I look on our <HI>Author</HI> as acting the generous Part in pretending a <HI>Contradiction</HI> between Mr&punc; <HI>W</HI>&mdash;<HI>d'</HI>s Words and an <HI>Article</HI> of the Church, with a View to fa&s;ten upon him the odious Imputation of <HI>fal&s;ifying</HI> his &s;o|lemn <HI>Sub&s;cription,</HI>&mdash;without &s;o much as letting us know in <HI>what Light</HI> he took Things, and <HI>where</HI> he &s;aw the <HI>Contradiction.</HI> For this, I confe&s;s, does not &s;hew it &s;elf to <HI>me,</HI> after all my Searches and Re&s;earches, to find it.

<P>But not contenting my &s;elf to imitate our <HI>Author'</HI>s Example, I am will|ing, in the mo&s;t explicit Manner, to &s;hew the Grounds of my Opinion, by de&s;cending to Particulars, and entring into the very Bowels of each <HI>Column</HI> with my Examination.

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Jan.</HI> 8. 1744, 5.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS waits on you with &s;ome further Ob&s;ervations, on the late printed LETTER to Mr. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> objecting to &s;ome of his Mea&s;ures, and calling upon him to <HI>vindicate his Conduct, or confe&s;s his Faults.</HI> I have &s;poken &s;ufficiently to the fir&s;t Fact there alledged again&s;t him: And as there is nothing of Connection between that and the others, I have no Need of repeating any Thing already &s;aid, to introduce my Remarks on our <HI>Author'</HI>s &s;econd Objection.</P>
<P>In the next Place then, you ob&s;erve, Sir, he excepts again&s;t Mr. <HI>W</HI>&mdash;<HI>d'</HI>s Conduct in <HI>publickly praying, and admini&s;tring the Sacrament, without any Re|gard to the Form pre&s;cribed in the Book of Common-Prayer.</HI> Our Author &s;u&s;|pects him to be <HI>herein acting, not a con&s;i&s;tent,</HI> but <HI>a wicked in&s;incere Part;</HI> and fears, this <HI>his Practice</HI> is <HI>an open Violation of what he &s;ub&s;crib'd and promis'd at his Ordination,</HI> and afterwards <HI>&s;olemnly, and repeatedly &s;ealed his Approbation of at the ble&s;&s;ed Sacrament.</HI></P>
<P>But, my Friend, as you are not wont to be ea&s;ily impos'd upon with po|pular In&s;inuations, with meer Sophi&s;ms, or with Arguments more <HI>ad Pom|pam,</HI> than <HI>ad Pugnam:</HI> &s;o I &s;hall much wonder, if the Declamation upon this Head appears to you to have any real Weight in it, after it has pa&s;s'd a pro|per Examination. For as pathetick and peremptory as our Author is here, I very much doubt whether he has not mi&s;s'd the true Meaning of the <HI>Church-Clergy's Sub&s;cription</HI> and <HI>Declaration</HI> he talks &s;o much of,&mdash;as expounded e|ven by Them&s;elves; and whether he has &s;ufficiently con&s;ider'd the true Force and Extent of the <HI>Obligation</HI> re&s;ulting therefrom, in Relation to their <HI>approving the Common-Prayer-Book,</HI> and <HI>u&s;ing the Form in the &s;aid Book
<PB N="15" REF="005594_0014_1026A7F5B38D6EF8">
pre&s;cribed, in publick Prayer and Admini&s;tration of Sacraments,</HI> AND NONE OTHER.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Step nece&s;&s;ary to deciding any <HI>Que&s;tion,</HI> is to adju&s;t and &s;ettle the Meaning of the <HI>Terms.</HI> And po&s;&s;ibly, in the <HI>Sub&s;cription</HI> or <HI>Declaration</HI> above&s;aid, it may admit of &s;ome Debate, what is the genuine Import and In|tent of the concluding Words, NONE OTHER. I am confident, upon the &s;ure&s;t Grounds, this limiting Clau&s;e is not to be taken literally, in the Strictne&s;s of the Expre&s;&s;ion, as if the Clergy meant to oblige them&s;elves to the <HI>&s;ole</HI> U&s;e of that <HI>individual</HI> Form in the Prayer-Book, <HI>exclu&s;ive</HI> of all other Forms in every Ca&s;e. For this Con&s;truction is utterly forbidden by the&s;e two Con|&s;iderations. (1.) It is contrary to the common Practice of the <HI>Clergy,</HI> who in their <HI>Prayer before Sermon</HI> pay no Regard to the <HI>Form</HI> in that Ca&s;e pre|&s;cribed in the <HI>Canon;</HI> as I &s;hall have Occa&s;ion more particularly to remark hereafter.&mdash;And then (2.) It is contrary to the known Cu&s;tom of the <HI>Bi|&s;hops,</HI> in compo&s;ing <HI>new</HI> Offices and Forms of Devotion, on &s;ome &s;pecial Occa&s;ions. It has been a Thing frequent, on Occa&s;ion of a &s;pecial <HI>Thank&s;|giving</HI> or <HI>Fa&s;t,</HI> to have &s;pecial <HI>Forms</HI> or <HI>Offices</HI> printed before-hand and di&s;|tributed to every Pari&s;h, for publick U&s;e in the Church on &s;uch Days. I well remember, particularly in the late Queen <HI>ANNE'</HI>s Reign, as by Means of the <HI>then-War</HI> there were frequent Occa&s;ions of this Nature, I had the Sight of &s;ome of the <HI>Forms of Prayer</HI> &s;pecially provided in that Ca&s;e. And in them, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve by the Way, there were u&s;ually one or two Collects for <HI>the Reformed Churches abroad:</HI>&mdash;which you'll plea&s;e to bear in Mind for a future Occa&s;ion, in the Sequel of this Di&s;pute.&mdash;Now the&s;e Reflections make it evident, to a Demon&s;tration, that when the <HI>Clergy</HI> of the Church &s;ub&s;cribe to u&s;e the <HI>Common-Prayer-Form,</HI> AND NONE OTHER, this is not to be taken in the <HI>rigid</HI> Sen&s;e, as our Author under&s;tands it, ab&s;olutely ex|cluding all other Forms on every Occa&s;ion what&s;oever. No, but the Sen&s;e mu&s;t be <HI>temper'd</HI> &s;ome how, to reconcile it to the <HI>Cu&s;toms</HI> in the Church, as abovemention'd. I can readily think of but two Con|&s;tructions, to put upon the Words, that are <HI>con&s;i&s;tent. Ex. gr.</HI> Mu&s;t the Words, NONE OTHER, intend&mdash;none other <HI>&s;tatedly?</HI> This Con|&s;truction reconciles the Sen&s;e to the U&s;e of other <HI>occa&s;ional</HI> Forms, enjoin'd by lawful Authority, &s;uch as the <HI>new</HI> Compo&s;ures made by the Bi&s;hops, as above. But then I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, this Con&s;truction does not &s;o well &s;uit with the Practice of the Clergy in <HI>&s;tatedly</HI> praying <HI>before Sermon</HI> without <HI>u&s;ing the Form pre&s;cribed</HI> for the Pulpit-Prayer.&mdash;Shall we then &s;ay, the Words, NONE OTHER, mu&s;t intend NONE DIVERS <HI>in kind, None el&s;e e&s;&s;entially varying from it.</HI> The Word, <HI>Other,</HI> is u&s;ed either to denote a <HI>numerical</HI> Difference, or a <HI>&s;pecifical</HI> Difference. But if we con&s;true it here in the former Sen&s;e (i. e. None other &s;o much as <HI>numerically</HI> di&s;tingui&s;ht from the <HI>Common-Prayer</HI>) we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e the <HI>Clergy</HI> chain'd down by their Sub&s;cription to the U&s;e of the <HI>Form in the Book,</HI> invariably, only, and exclu|&s;ively of <HI>every Form</HI> not actually there written: which is a Sen&s;e evidently

<P>But further, let me ob&s;erve to you, <HI>Sir,</HI> if we &s;hould go into a critical Con&s;ideration of what mu&s;t be under&s;tood, by fair Con&s;truction, as inclu|ded in the Idea of PUBLICK PRAYER, according to the Idiom of <HI>Epi&s;copal</HI> Lan|guage, it would perhaps be no impo&s;&s;ible Attempt, to reconcile Mr. <HI>W</HI>&mdash;<HI>d'</HI>s <HI>Conduct</HI> abroad with his <HI>sub&s;cription</HI> and <HI>Declaration</HI> at home. Its well known, the PUBLICK MINISTERS (&s;o; called) in <HI>England</HI> are Mini&s;ters Epi&s;|copally ordered, in Conformity to the Book of Ordination: Such only are held <HI>Mini&s;ters in the Church of England.</HI>&mdash;So, the PUBLICK CHURCHES there, are the Cathedral and other Collegiate Churches, the Pari&s;h-Churches, and Chappels, con&s;ecrated to perform Divine Service in according to the Or|ders of the Church e&s;tabli&s;h'd by Law.&mdash;And thus, in the Sen&s;e of the Sub|&s;cription before us, PUBLICK PRAYER is "common and open Prayer" in the <HI>publick Churches,</HI> the Hou&s;es dedicated to the <HI>U&s;e</HI> of "mini&s;tring in the Congregation, by the pre&s;cript Form of Divine Service in the Church of <HI>England.</HI>" At lea&s;t this is the <HI>Canonical</HI> Sen&s;e of the Expre&s;&s;ion. For the <HI>Con&s;titutions</HI> and <HI>Canons</HI> of the Church of <HI>England</HI> know no &s;uch Think as PUBLICK Prayer done in <HI>"private Conventicles";</HI> or in "PRETENDED CHURCHES, which is the <HI>Canonical</HI> Denomination for all "<HI>Meetings A&s;&s;emblies, or Con|gregations (of the king's born Subjects) within this Realm,</HI>" OTHER than the Epi&s;|copal Congregations or A&s;&s;emblies, By <HI>Law</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hed.&mdash;Nor in Truth are any deem'd PUBLICK OFFICES in Religion, <HI>other</HI> than tho&s;e performed in the&s;e <HI>true</HI> and <HI>lawful</HI> A&s;&s;emblies, the only PUBLICK ASSEMBLIES in the Sen&s;e of the <HI>Canons.</HI>&mdash;Now, according to this View of the Ca&s;e, tho' &s;ome (ob|&s;olete) <HI>Canons</HI> of the Church may po&s;&s;ibly be alledg'd against Mr. <HI>W</HI>&mdash;<HI>d'</HI>s Conduct, in Point of frequenting <HI>Conventicles,</HI> or <HI>pretended Churches,</HI> and ad|mini&s;tring in <HI>private Meetings,</HI> as if the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> were <HI>true</HI> and <HI>lawful Churches;</HI> yet with Regard to not <HI>u&s;ing the Church-Liturgy in</HI> PUBLICK <HI>Prayer,</HI> I don't &s;ee he was either broken any Canon, or infring'd upon his Sub&s;cription. I que&s;tion indeed whether the Clergy of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> hold them|&s;elves
<PB N="17" REF="005594_0016_1026A7FCC9F02C98">
obliged by their <HI>Sub&s;cription</HI> to the like invariable U&s;e of the Com|mon-Prayer-Book in the <HI>private Offices</HI> of Devotion, as in <HI>Publick Prayer.</HI> And if the <HI>Nonconformable</HI> A&s;&s;emblies are reputed but <HI>private</HI> Meetings, a Church-Clergyman occa&s;ionally officiating in <HI>&s;uch</HI> Meetings may e&s;teem him&s;elf at Liberty to &s;u&s;pend the U&s;e of the Forms pre&s;cribed for <HI>Publick Prayer.</HI></P>
<P>But, <HI>Sir,</HI> if you judge this Argument turns upon too critical Di&s;tinctions, and are di&s;pos'd to allow, that the religious A&s;&s;emblies in <HI>New-England</HI> are properly, what our <HI>Author</HI> calls'em, <HI>Publick A&s;&s;emblies,</HI> not what the <HI>Church-Canons</HI> cen&s;ure by the Name of <HI>pretended Churches,</HI> or private Conventicles, and that therefore <HI>Prayer</HI> performed in &s;uch A&s;&s;emblies is in ju&s;t Con&s;truc|tion <HI>Publick Prayer,</HI>&mdash;I need not &s;tand to debate this Point with you at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Other Rea&s;ons I have &s;till, <HI>Sir,</HI> why I can by no Means concur with our <HI>Author,</HI> in thinking that Mr. W&mdash;d'<HI>s Sub&s;cription</HI> to the &s;pecial <HI>Article,</HI> re|fer'd to, obliges him &s;o indi&s;pen&s;ably to u&s;e the <HI>Common-Prayer-Forms,</HI> but that he may <HI>occa&s;ionally</HI> omit u&s;ing them, where he judges <HI>Free-praying</HI> mo&s;t expedient and eligible (all Circum&s;tances con&s;ider'd) as here in the <HI>New-England</HI> Congregations. For undoubtedly this particular <HI>Sub&s;cription</HI> to that &s;pecial <HI>Article</HI> about the U&s;e of the <HI>Common-Prayer,</HI> is not ju&s;tly to be &s;uppos'd of more <HI>exten&s;ive</HI> Obligation in Point of <HI>Place,</HI> than his general <HI>Sub&s;cription</HI> to the 39 <HI>Articles of Religion.</HI> And if we con&s;ult the <HI>Ratification</HI> at the End of the Book of <HI>Articles,</HI> this expre&s;ly tells us <HI>how f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">r</HI> they extend by Force of the <HI>Sub&s;cription,</HI> being only "<HI>approved and allowed to be holden and executed</HI> WITHIN THE REALM" of <HI>England;</HI> and here it &s;tops, with|out the Addition of <HI>"other Dominions,"</HI> as el&s;ewhere &s;ometimes. Now this <HI>Ratification</HI> is one Thing expre&s;ly included within the <HI>three parti|cular Articles,</HI> our Author refers to, as what the Church e&s;teems of great Importance; and I think, Mr. <HI>W&mdash;d</HI> has &s;ub&s;crib'd to the <HI>Ratification</HI> in the 3d <HI>Article,</HI> as well as to the <HI>U&s;e of the common Prayer</HI> in the <HI>&s;econd.</HI> By a fair Con&s;equence then, laying the&s;e Things together, and interpreting the 2d <HI>Article</HI> by the 3d, his <HI>Sub&s;cription</HI> to the <HI>U&s;e of the Form</HI> in <HI>the Common-Prayer-Book pre&s;cribed,</HI> AND NONE OTHER, mu&s;t in Rea&s;on be con&s;trued, at the mo&s;t; but only an Engagement to <HI>u&s;e</HI> that WITHIN THE REALM, where it is by publick Authority e&s;tabli&s;h'd; and not be &s;uppos'd to extend its Obligation indifferently <HI>all over the World,</HI> or even &s;o far as <HI>New England,</HI> which tho' belonging to the <HI>King's Dominions,</HI> yet is not WITHIN HIS REALM, but is included under the Name of FOREIGN PARTS, con&s;tantly &s;o apply'd even by the incorporated <HI>Society</HI> at home for <HI>propagating the Go&s;pel.</HI></P>
<P>And that the above Remark is not without very ju&s;t Foundation, it may further help to convince you, if you'll in&s;pect the <HI>Canon</HI> next to that our <HI>Author</HI> has alledg'd on this Occa&s;ion. The 37th <HI>Canon</HI> requir|ing the very &s;ame <HI>Sub&s;cription,</HI> in Ca&s;e of a <HI>licen&s;ed Mini&s;ter's coming to</HI> RESIDE IN ANY DIOCESS, &s;ays, <HI>He &s;hall not be permitted,</HI> THERE <HI>to preach,&mdash;

<P>Her 19th <HI>Article</HI> expre&s;&s;es no &s;uch Schi&s;matick Spirit; but frames the Defi|nition of a <HI>Church</HI> lawfully con&s;tituted, in &s;uch large and general Terms, as to comprehend all the <HI>Foreign</HI> Prote&s;tant Churches, as well as her&s;elf. Thus &s;ays the <HI>Article,&mdash;"A vi&s;ible Church of Chri&s;t is a Congregation of faithful Men, in the which the pure Word of God is preached, and the Sacraments be duly admini&s;tred ac|cording to Chri&s;t's Ordinance, in all tho&s;e Things that of Nece&s;&s;ity are requi&s;ite to the &s;ame."</HI> Bp.

The <HI>Bi&s;hop'</HI>s Expo&s;ition of this Article might be confirm'd, I doubt not, from the <HI>Homilies</HI> and <HI>Prayers</HI> of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and from the Writings of the Engli&s;h Bi&s;hops and Divines in the beginning of the Reformation, which are the be&s;t Commentaries on the <HI>Articles.</HI> Re|markable is that Pa&s;&s;age of the famous HOOKER, in his <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Polity</HI> (Lib. 3.

For In|&s;tance, the Interpo&s;ition of <HI>publick Authority</HI> may, in Things <HI>indifferent,</HI> very much alter a Ca&s;e, and make that a <HI>Duty,</HI> or <HI>expedient,</HI> which otherwi&s;e we might think to be not &s;o. At lea&s;t this is the Doctrine of the <HI>Church of England</HI> in her 30th <HI>Canon,</HI> which &s;ays, <Q><HI>Things of them&s;elves</HI> indifferent <HI>do in &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ort</HI> alter their Natures, <HI>when they are either</HI> commanded <HI>or</HI> forbidden <HI>by a lawful Magi&s;trate, and may not be</HI> omitted <HI>at every Man's Plea&s;ure, contrary to the Law, when they be</HI> com|manded, <HI>nor</HI> u&s;ed <HI>when they are</HI> prohibited.</Q>&mdash;I may ju&s;tly add upon it, That where they are neither <HI>commanded</HI> nor <HI>prohibited</HI> by Law, and &s;o are left in their native State of <HI>Indifference,</HI> here certainly it is at <HI>every Man's Plea&s;ure,</HI> either to <HI>u&s;e</HI> or to <HI>omit</HI> them, as he judges (upon Con&s;ideration of all Circum&s;tances) wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t expedient, both in Re|gard to his own private Benefit and the publick Good.&mdash;The Alteration of <HI>Place,</HI> in point of &s;ettled Abode, or occa&s;ional Re&s;idence, very often produces an Alteration in point of <HI>Duty.</HI> It's a Maxim founded in Rea|&s;on, that <HI>where</HI> the <HI>Grounds</HI> of any Duty no longer &s;ub&s;i&s;t, <HI>there</HI> the <HI>Ob|ligation</HI> is di&s;continu'd.

<P>But &s;till, upon a Review of this <HI>Promi&s;e,</HI> I find by the Tenor of it Room for another <HI>Re&s;triction,</HI> which reduces the Obligation of it within the narrow|e&s;t Limits, not exceeding the Bounds of even that &s;ingle <HI>Congregation,</HI> where he has <HI>Charge.</HI> Surely, His <HI>Promi&s;e</HI> in An&s;wer to the <HI>Que&s;tion</HI> put to him at Ordination, ought in all Rea&s;on to be interpreted as carrying an <HI>Analo|gy</HI> or <HI>Proportion</HI> with the <HI>Bi&s;hop'</HI>s Demand.

A Re&s;triction evidently cou|ched in his <HI>Promi&s;e,</HI> by the &s;tronge&s;t Implication. So that when in Provi|dence he is <HI>excentrical</HI> to his &s;tated <HI>Charge</HI> at any Time, he has a tempora|ry <HI>Relea&s;e</HI> from his <HI>Promi&s;e,</HI> &s;o far as relates to his <HI>mini&s;tring,</HI> or even to his <HI>giving Diligence</HI> to mini&s;ter, according to the <HI>Church Forms.</HI> Notwith|&s;tanding, for Argument's Sake, I will wave the Advantage of tho&s;e re&s;train|ing Words, and grant that by Parity of Rea&s;on his Promi&s;e may oblige him beyond the Limits of his own particular <HI>Charge:</HI> Yet it is po&s;&s;ible, in &s;ome Ca&s;es, he may be punctual to his <HI>promi&s;e</HI> afore&s;aid, tho' he actually <HI>mini&s;ter</HI> in the Congregation <HI>without</HI> u&s;ing the Epi&s;copal Forms.

<P>I have nothing at all to do here, but to con&s;ider this In&s;tance of Mr. <HI>W&mdash;d'</HI>s Conduct in point of <HI>Con&s;i&s;tency,</HI> which is the View under which our <HI>Author</HI> objects to it. The Scope (I think) of the Argument here again&s;t his <HI>Itinerancy</HI> is, that "<HI>the Authority,</HI> which Mr. <HI>W&mdash;d</HI> as a Mini&s;ter of the <HI>Church of England</HI> had given him by the <HI>Bi&s;hop,</HI>" was limited in the Exerci&s;e of it, to "the <HI>Congregation</HI> where he &s;hall be <HI>lawfully appointed</HI> thereto."&mdash;To which I &s;ay, if his <HI>Ordination Commi&s;|&s;ion</HI> did <HI>not</HI> give him <HI>Authority,</HI> as well to mini&s;ter <HI>out</HI> of his particular Charge, as <HI>in</HI> it, then we may rationally conclude, his <HI>Ordination-Promi&s;e</HI> with Relation to the <HI>Exerci&s;e</HI> of that Authority, in u&s;ing the <HI>Liturgy,</HI> re&s;pected him al&s;o only <HI>within</HI> his appointed Charge: and in this View of the Ca&s;e, not his <HI>Sub&s;cription,</HI> not the <HI>Articles,</HI> or <HI>Orders,</HI> or <HI>Canons</HI> of the Church, but his <HI>Commi&s;&s;ion</HI> ought to have been objected to him before, at lea&s;t to &s;horten the Di&s;pute: Methinks, this Argument &s;ingly might have &s;tood <HI>in&s;tar ominum.</HI>&mdash;Or, if his <HI>Commi&s;&s;ion</HI> (in its true Mean|ing)
<PB N="35" REF="005594_0034_10269163FAD130A0">
<HI>did</HI> empower him to mini&s;ter <HI>out</HI> of his particular <HI>Cure</HI> and <HI>Charge,</HI> then I think our <HI>Author's</HI> Argument from this <HI>Commi&s;&s;ion</HI> carries no Force with it to condemn his <HI>Itineration.</HI> An Argument which proves <HI>too much,</HI> proves <HI>too little.</HI> But if the Words of the <HI>Commi&s;&s;ion</HI> be taken exactly in the <HI>Letter,</HI> without allowing a Latitude of Sen&s;e, this would di&s;empower the Clergy &s;o much as to <HI>exchange Pulpits,</HI> or <HI>a&s;&s;i&s;t</HI> one a|nother occa&s;ionally; for <HI>this,</HI> by the fore&s;aid Rule of Interpretation, wou'd <HI>violate</HI> their <HI>Commi&s;&s;ion,</HI> as well as <HI>Itinerancy.</HI> Here's a <HI>Reductio ad ab&s;urdum,</HI> which I believe can't ea&s;ily be &s;urmounted: But our <HI>Author</HI> mu&s;t relinqui&s;h his Plea from the general <HI>Commi&s;&s;ion,</HI> and fly to a parti|cular <HI>Licence.</HI></P>
<P>And 'tis Fact, by the Conce&s;&s;ion of Epi&s;copal Writers, that the <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> (as al&s;o the two Univer&s;ities in <HI>England.</HI>) have the Power to grant <HI>Licences,</HI> of a wider Extent than the narrow Di&s;trict of a &s;ingle Congre|gation or Pari&s;h, even through the large&s;t City, or through a whole Dioce&s;s, and the <HI>Archbi&s;hops</HI> through a whole Province, if they plea&s;e, to any ordain'd Mini&s;ters they think fit; "who in Virtue of &s;uch Li|cence, may travel, if they will, from Place to Place, as <HI>Itinerants.</HI>" The &s;ending forth <HI>itinerant</HI> Preachers was a Practice in the <HI>Church of England</HI> at the Beginning of the Reformation; probably in &s;ome De|gree has been kept up all along; or if ob&s;olete for any Time, has re|markably been reviv'd of late Years, particularly with Relation to <HI>foreign Parts.</HI> Mr. <HI>W&mdash;d</HI> is not the only Epi&s;copal <HI>Itinerant</HI> in <HI>America.</HI> It's well known, that <HI>Itinerant</HI> Mini&s;ters (under this expre&s;s Denomination) are avow'd by the <HI>Society</HI> at home <HI>for propagating the Go&s;pel,</HI> who have at this very Time a Number on their Mi&s;&s;ion. Thus "Mr. <HI>Morris</HI> in the Ab&s;tract of their Proceedings, for 1743. is nam'd expre&s;ly ITINERANT Mi&s;&s;ionary in <HI>Connecticut;</HI> Mr. <HI>Punder&s;on,</HI> ITINERANT Mi&s;&s;ionary in <HI>New-England;</HI> Mr. <HI>Lind&s;ay,</HI> ITINERANT Mi&s;&s;ionary in <HI>Penn|&s;ylvania</HI> and <HI>New-Jer&s;ey,</HI>" with others.&mdash;In the general Notion then, Mini&s;ters of this <HI>Character</HI> be judg'd agreeable to the <HI>Con&s;titution of the Church of England,</HI> which our <HI>Author</HI> refers us to. We may well think, it's no <HI>Violation</HI> therefore of this original COMMISSION from the Bi&s;hop, to act beyond the Limits of a particular <HI>Cure</HI> or <HI>Charge,</HI> or even in the Character of an <HI>Itinerant.</HI> And with Regard to a &s;pecial LI|CENCE, I que&s;tion whether the <HI>Itinerant Mi&s;&s;ionaries</HI> above-mentioned have had this, any more than Mr. <HI>W&mdash;d.</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e they all have the common <HI>Letters of Orders</HI> from the Bi&s;hop: and why <HI>ordain'd</HI> Mini|&s;ters mayn't be thought &s;ufficiently authoriz'd to exerci&s;e their Office, without &s;pecial <HI>Letters of Licence</HI> &s;upervening, I cannot well under&s;tand. Nor does it appear to me a Breach of <HI>Canon,</HI> at lea&s;t no Infraction upon the <HI>Oath</HI> of Canonical Obedience, to act <HI>without</HI> &s;uch a Licence. For
<PB N="36" REF="005594_0035_1026A833CDC98E68">
the <HI>Oath</HI> is of Obedience to the <HI>Bi&s;hop;</HI> not directly to the <HI>Canons.</HI> The <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> mu&s;t interpo&s;e his Injunction, or Impo&s;ition, before the <HI>Canon</HI> becomes binding: and even in this Ca&s;e (as I have already re|mark'd) the <HI>Clergy</HI> apprehend them&s;elves &s;till in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a <HI>di&s;cre|tionary</HI> Power with Relation to their own Act of Submi&s;&s;ion and Obe|dience; the Tenor of the <HI>Oath</HI> being, to obey the Bi&s;hop only in <HI>omni|bus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">citis &amp; hone&s;tis.</HI>&mdash;I don't &s;ee then but that Mr. <HI>W&mdash;d,</HI> though acting in Character of an <HI>Itinerant,</HI> may &s;till be acting a <HI>con&s;i&s;tent Part as a Mini&s;ter of the Church of England;</HI> which is all our <HI>Author</HI> calls us to con&s;ider.</P>
<P>There's one Thing more &s;ugge&s;ted in his LETTER (<HI>pag.</HI> 5,) on this Head of <HI>Con&s;i&s;tency,</HI> which brings us back again to the <HI>Article</HI> about <HI>u&s;ing the Book of Common Prayer,</HI> which Mr. <HI>W&mdash;d &s;ub&s;crib'd</HI> to, and yet has &s;ince in a <HI>Journal</HI> made that Remark, "When the <HI>Spirit of Prayer</HI> began to be lo&s;t, then <HI>Forms of Prayer</HI> were invented;" and &s;eems by the Connection of what he &s;ays there, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hink "the <HI>Inventi|on</HI> of them <HI>"a &s;ad Symptom of the Decay of vital Religion,</HI> as much as even <HI>"Preaching by Notes.</HI>&mdash;Now, Sir, whether he was of this Senti|ment when he &s;ub&s;crib'd, or has &s;ince chang'd his Mind, I don't &s;ee that the <HI>Con&s;equences</HI> our <HI>Author</HI> infers, will in either View of the Ca&s;e, nece&s;&s;arily follow.</P>
<P>If Mr. <HI>W&mdash;d</HI> in fact has <HI>changed</HI> his Mind about <HI>Forms</HI> in Devo|tion, I think he may neverthele&s;s be <HI>con&s;i&s;tent</HI> in <HI>blaming</HI> the Church-Clergy for <HI>violating their Sub&s;cription</HI> to the 39 <HI>Articles:</HI> for the&s;e were de&s;ign'd to &s;ecure <HI>Unity</HI> or <HI>Con&s;ent of Faith;</HI> and the Clergy's <HI>Sub&s;crip|tion</HI> to the&s;e leaves them no Liberty to &s;peak or write contrary to what they've &s;ub&s;crib'd; and hence, if in Points of <HI>Faith</HI> they <HI>"change their Minds"</HI> and teach contrary to their <HI>Sub&s;cription,</HI> they are not <HI>"capable of being vindicated in the &s;ame Way,"</HI> as Mr. <HI>W&mdash;d is;</HI> unle&s;s it is not po&s;&s;ible for a Man with a &s;afe Con&s;cience &s;o much as occa&s;ionally to <HI>u&s;e</HI> any Forms of Prayer, while yet he has an unfavourable Opinion of the <HI>Ri&s;e</HI> of Forms. For it was only the <HI>U&s;e</HI> of the Forms, that is re&s;pected in the Sub&s;cripti|on, according to the Opinion of &s;ome of the be&s;t Defenders of the Church. According to their Sen&s;e of the Matter, Mr. <HI>W&mdash;d</HI> did not <HI>"&s;ub&s;cribe to the Book of Common Prayer",</HI> properly &s;peaking, i. e. did not (as our <HI>Author</HI> repre&s;ents it) "&s;ub&s;cribe to <HI>all Things con|tained in it."</HI> If you will read (Sir) the Controver&s;y between Dr.<HI>Cal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">|my</HI> and his Adver&s;aries about Conformity, you'll find they declare, the true Meaning of the <HI>Sub&s;cription is,</HI> not to <HI>give unfeigned A&s;&s;ent and Con|&s;ent</HI> to every Thing in the Common-prayer-book, but only to the <HI>U&s;e</HI> of the Forms therein pre&s;cribed: And that this implies in its Nature an Approbation even of the Forms them&s;elves (at the mo&s;t) in Relation

only to the <HI>U&s;e,</HI> not the <HI>Impo&s;ition</HI> of them. Mr. <HI>W&mdash;d</HI> therefore hav|ing &s;ub&s;crib'd only to the <HI>U&s;e</HI> of the Liturgy, might without <HI>violating</HI> his Sub&s;cription alter his Mind about the <HI>Ri&s;e</HI> of Forms, &s;o long as this Change of Sentiment does not affect the <HI>Article</HI> he &s;ub&s;crib'd to, and is not &s;uch in its Nature as to be incon&s;i&s;tent with all <HI>U&s;e</HI> of them, while he thinks the <HI>Matter</HI> of the Prayers <HI>agreeable to the Word of God,</HI> and the Ca&s;e &s;uch as makes Submi&s;&s;ion to the <HI>U&s;e</HI> of them expedient.&mdash;Whereas the Clergy's preaching contrary to, and condemning any of the 39 <HI>Articles,</HI> de&s;troys <HI>Con&s;ent of Faith,</HI> &s;ubverts the very End of their <HI>Sub&s;cription,</HI> is a di|rect Violation of their <HI>Sub&s;cription,</HI> and does not well con&s;i&s;t with their not renouncing it.</P>
<P>But indeed I &s;ee no Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uppo&s;ing a <HI>Change</HI> of Sentiment in Mr. <HI>W&mdash;d.</HI> For notwith&s;tanding an unfavourable Opinion about the <HI>Ri&s;e</HI> of Forms of Prayer, yet &s;o long as that Opinion was only &s;uch as might con&s;i&s;t with the lawful <HI>u&s;ing</HI> them, in &s;ome Circum&s;tances, he might look on him&s;elf at <HI>Liberty</HI> notwith&s;tanding, to <HI>&s;ub&s;cribe</HI> to the <HI>U&s;e</HI> of the Liturgy WITHIN THE CHURCH AND REALM, and might judge it <HI>expedient</HI> in his Ca&s;e. For, as he might po&s;&s;ibly be acted with a View to &s;ome peculiar <HI>Advantages</HI> (as he thought) to &s;erve the Ends of the Mini&s;try, within the Pale of the <HI>E&s;tabli&s;hment,</HI> Particularly in regard <HI>Epi&s;copal Orders</HI> might "render his Mini&s;try more currant &amp; indi&s;putable and accepta|ble among the Generality of the People of <HI>England:</HI>" So perhaps he was partly inclined to &s;eek Admi&s;&s;ion into <HI>publick Mini&s;try,</HI> upon Principle in Relation to <HI>Epi&s;copacy,</HI> which he might be &s;trongly attach'd to, more than to the <HI>Liturgy,</HI> and might at the &s;ame Time think his Sentiment about the <HI>Ri&s;e</HI> of Forms of Prayer not a &s;ufficient Ground of <HI>Separa|tion</HI> from the <HI>Church of England.</HI> The&s;e and other Con&s;iderations, of Weight with him to per&s;uade to his Continuance in the Communion of the <HI>Church,</HI> might more than counter balance his Opinion about the Occa&s;ion of <HI>Forms</HI> being <HI>invented:</HI> e&s;pecially when by his <HI>Sub&s;cription</HI> to the <HI>U&s;e</HI> of them in Publick Prayer, he would obtain the valuable Liberty (as he thought) of mini&s;tring in the <HI>Publick Churches,</HI> which he could not enjoy without complying with the Terms of the Legal E&s;ta|blishment; and e&s;pecially too when his <HI>Sub&s;cription</HI> intended nothing more than a Declaration of <HI>A&s;&s;ent</HI> and <HI>Con&s;ent</HI> to the <HI>U&s;e</HI> of the impos'd Forms, with an <HI>Approbation</HI> of them only in Relation to their <HI>Matter,</HI> and to their <HI>U&s;e</HI> in this Ca&s;e of their <HI>impo&s;ition.</HI> For thus &s;ays the learned Mr. O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e, in his Defence of Mini&s;terial Conformity. <Q><HI>Forms of Prayer</HI> have both their Commodities, and Di&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">commodities.&mdash;We don't de|clare for the <HI>impo&s;ing</HI> them, nor approve of it, or a&s;&s;ent and con&s;ent to it.&mdash;We are not at all concern'd in the <HI>impo&s;ing,</HI> nor are we bound to declare, that <HI>That</HI> was well done, either <HI>in it &s;elf,</HI> or <HI>in its Circum&s;tances.</HI>&mdash;
