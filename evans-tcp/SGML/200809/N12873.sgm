<P><HI>SINCE</HI> preaching this Sermon, I have been told that &s;ome in the mini&s;try, who heard it, have murmured again&s;t the doctrine.

<P>EVERY &s;tep of Chri&s;t's humiliation was at|tended with &s;ome di&s;coveries of his glory to ballance them; for even when he humbled him|&s;elf God did in &s;ome mea&s;ure exalt him, as an earne&s;t of his future exaltation. When wrapped in &s;waddling clothes, and laid in a manger, who could think him the Son of God? But &s;ee him now attended with a choir of angels, and we &s;hall &s;ay, &s;urely in can be no other but the Son of God; concerning whom it was &s;aid, when he was brought into the world, <HI>Let all the angels of God wor&s;hip him,</HI> Heb. i. 6. Our context acquaints us with the notice given of the arrival of this am|ba&s;&s;ador from Heaven, the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to certain &s;hepherds, by the angel of the Lord, at who&s;e pre&s;ence they were &s;ore afraid. But the
<PB N="4" REF="016277_0004_0F9C1BA419FD59D0">
angel giving fir&s;t a <HI>&s;upercedeas</HI> to their fears, fur|ni&s;heth them with abundant matter of joy. Con|text, ver. 10, <HI>Behold I bring you good tidings of great joy, which &s;hall be to you,</HI> and not to you only, <HI>but to all people, for to you,</HI> you men, <HI>is born this day in the City of David,</HI> the place foretold <HI>by the prophets, the Saviour even Chri&s;t the Lord; and as he is the &s;aviour of all, it is not to be kept &s;ecret, but publi&s;hed for the joy of all people.</HI> No &s;ooner had the angel delivered his me&s;&s;age, but &s;uddenly a multitude of the heavenly ho&s;ts appear to prai&s;e God, and congratulate men on this &s;o|lemn occa&s;ion, as in the text; they give God the glory of this work; for his kindne&s;s and love de|&s;igned it, and his wi&s;dom contrived it; his other works are for his glory, but the redemption of the world is for his glory in the highe&s;t, <HI>Glory to God in the highe&s;t!</HI> They congratulate men on this occa&s;ion, &s;ince by Chri&s;t, the enmity that &s;in had rai&s;ed between God and them was &s;lain, and a peaceable corre&s;pondence re&s;ettled; <HI>On earth peace, good-will to men.</HI> From the &s;acred text I &s;hall lay down the following doctrines to be con|&s;idered at this time, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>That God de&s;igned the mediation of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t for all men equally.</P>
<P>By the mediation of Chri&s;t, I mean, all that was incumbent on him to do and &s;uffer, as me|diator between God and man, in order to put all men into a capacity of being ju&s;tified, pardoned, reconciled to, and having peace with God, upon their conver&s;ion from &s;in, and turning to the Lord. So that all men may upon their fulfilling the con|ditions

to be performed on their part, have an ac|tual intere&s;t in the ble&s;&s;ing of a Saviour.</P>
<P>That God thus de&s;igned the mediation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t for all men equally, I &s;hall endeavour to prove at this time, and then &s;hut up the di&s;|cour&s;e by a practical improvement. And our doctrine will appear in a clear and &s;trong light from the following con&s;iderations, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. The frequent, clear and expre&s;s manner in which the &s;criptures teach us that God would have all men be &s;aved; <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">1. Tim. 2.4.</NOTE> and that he is the Saviour of all men; <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">1. Tim. 4.10.</NOTE> not willing that any &s;hould peri&s;h; <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">2. Pet. 3.<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> that by the righteou&s;ne&s;s of one, the free gift came upon all men to ju&s;tifi|cation of life; <NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">Rom. 5.18.</NOTE> that Chri&s;t gave him&s;elf a ran&s;om for all; <NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">1. Tim. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">.6.</NOTE> and by the favour of God ta&s;ted death for every man&punc; <NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">Heb. 2.9.</NOTE> The&s;e are but a few of the &s;cripture texts which expre&s;ly affirm God willing the &s;alvation of all men; yet there are tho&s;e that tell us, that God's willing the &s;al|vation of all, and Chri&s;t dying for all, intends no more, than that Chri&s;t died for &s;ome of all na|tions, and God wills that &s;ome of all nations &s;hould be &s;aved. Not con&s;idering that accord|ing to their limitation, it might be more truly and properly &s;aid, that God would have all men be damned, &s;ince according to them, he has already pa&s;&s;ed a decree which renders the damnation of the greate&s;t part of men unavoidable: And that Chri&s;t died for none, &s;ince according to them, tho&s;e for whom he died are none, compared with the
<PB N="6" REF="016277_0006_0F9C1BA903511B18">
greater number, for whom they &s;ay he did not die. If any &s;hould &s;ay, that Chri&s;t died for his friends and for his &s;heep, but all are not his friends or his &s;heep, therefore he died not for all: I an|&s;wer, it is no where &s;aid that Chri&s;t died only for his &s;heep and his friends; we may therefore retort the argument, and &s;ay, he that died for his friends and enemies, for the &s;heep that heard his voice, and for the lo&s;t &s;heep that did not hearken to his voice, died for all: But Chri&s;t died for friends and enemies, for when we were enemies Chri&s;t died for us; <NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">Rom. 5.8.</NOTE> and for his lo&s;t &s;heep, for he came to &s;eek and &s;ave that which was lo&s;t; therefore he died for all. <NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">Mat. 18.11.</NOTE></P>
<P N="2">II. The truth of our doctrine will further appear by tho&s;e numerous &s;criptures which re|pre&s;ent Chri&s;t the &s;aviour of the world&punc; Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the &s;in of the world; <NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">John 1.19.</NOTE> This is Chri&s;t the Saviour of the world; <NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">John 4.42.</NOTE> The bread of God is he which com|eth down from Heaven, and giveth life unto the world.

John <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">.2.</NOTE> Now it is a doctrine held by all Pro|te&s;tants, in oppo&s;ition to Papi&s;ts, that the &s;crip|tures are clear and ea&s;y to be under&s;tood, in all things nece&s;&s;ary to be believed. But if the&s;e places do not fully prove that Chri&s;t was given of God to be the Saviour of the whole world, there is no rea&s;on to &s;ay &s;o. But Papi&s;ts mu&s;t be in the right and Prote&s;tants in the wrong. It is truly &s;urpri&s;ing that any who call them&s;elves Prote&s;tants &s;hould tell us, that by the world, in the&s;e &s;criptures, we are to under&s;tand the world of the elect, who are but a &s;mall remnant. Since then it might be more truly and properly &s;aid, that God &s;o hated the world, as that he &s;ent not his &s;on into the world to &s;ave the world but to condemn it. Should any &s;ay that Chri&s;t prayed not for the world in 17th of John, but for the elect only, and there|fore he died not for the world but for the elect only, I would a&s;k, how Chri&s;t came to make it our duty to pray for all men, yea, for our very enemies, and he him&s;elf neglect to do it? Fur|ther, it is evident that that very prayer in the 17th of John, was made by Chri&s;t out of love to the world; for he prays for his apo&s;tles in particu|lar, for this declared end, that the world might know and believe in him. See ver. 21.<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">3. That Chri&s;t in that chapter as expre&s;sly prays for the world, as he does for his apo&s;tles.</P>
<P N="3">III. The mediation of Chri&s;t will appear to be univer&s;al, if we con&s;ider tho&s;e places of &s;crip|ture
<PB N="8" REF="016277_0008_0F9C1BABC192B1D8">
which either expre&s;ly &s;ay, or by plain con|&s;equence a&s;&s;ert, that Chri&s;t died for them that peri&s;h; for if he died for them that peri&s;h, and for them that do not peri&s;h, he doubtle&s;s died for all. That Chri&s;t died for them that do not peri&s;h will be granted, and that he died for &s;ome that peri&s;h is ea&s;ily proved from &s;cripture, which gives the &s;ame rea&s;on to affirm that he died for all that do &s;o. See the following &s;criptures. <HI>And through thy knowledge &s;hall thy weak brother peri&s;h for whom Chri&s;t died.</HI> <NOTE N="(r)" PLACE="foot">1. Cor. 8.11.</NOTE> <HI>De&s;troy not him with thy meat for whom Chri&s;t died.</HI> <NOTE N="(&s;)" PLACE="foot">Rom. 14.15.</NOTE> The author to the Hebrews tells us, that if we &s;in wilfully, there would remain no more &s;acrifice for &s;in; &s;eeing &s;uch would be guilty of trampling under foot the Son of God, and counting the blood of the covenant, by which they were &s;anctified, an unholy thing. <NOTE N="(t)" PLACE="foot">Heb. 10.26, 29&punc;</NOTE> But how could it be &s;aid that no further &s;acrifice for &s;in remains to them for whom no &s;acrifice was ever offered or intended? How were they &s;anctified by the blood of that covenant from which they were from the foun|dation of the world excluded? Or how can they neglect this great &s;alvation, for whom it never was intended? Furthermore, the apo&s;tle Peter tells us of &s;ome fal&s;e teachers who &s;hould bring in damnable here&s;ies, even denying the Lord that bought them. <NOTE N="(u)" PLACE="foot">2. Pet. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">.<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> Now from the&s;e &s;criptures it appears, that Chri&s;t died for them that peri&s;h&punc; for them that &s;hall be damned for abetting dam|nable here&s;ies, he therefore died for all, and his mediation mu&s;t be of univer&s;al extent.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="9" REF="016277_0009_0F9C1BAC581FB090">IV. Further to prove the extent of Chri&s;t's me|diation, I would propo&s;e to be con&s;idered; the obligation lying upon all to whom the go&s;pel comes to believe in Chri&s;t: For if it be true, that it is the duty not only of &s;ome few, but of all to whom the go&s;pel comes, to believe in Chri&s;t, and own him for their &s;aviour, it mu&s;t be true that he came into the world to be the &s;aviour of all men. But what &s;ay the &s;criptures? <HI>This is the work,</HI> i. e. <HI>the will of God, that you &s;hould believe in him whom he hath &s;ent</HI> <NOTE N="(w)" PLACE="foot">John 6.29.</NOTE>. <HI>If you believe not that I am he, you &s;hall die in your &s;ins</HI> <NOTE N="(x)" PLACE="foot">John 8.24.</NOTE>. <HI>He that believeth not is condemned already</HI> <NOTE N="(y)" PLACE="foot">John <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">.18.</NOTE>. <HI>The &s;ame came to bear witne&s;s of the light, that all men might believe in him</HI> <NOTE N="(z)" PLACE="foot">John 1.7.</NOTE>. <HI>He that believes not in him &s;hall not &s;ee life, but the wrath of God abid|eth on him</HI> <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">John 3.36.</NOTE>. <HI>And when he is come, he will con|vince the world of &s;in, becau&s;e they believe not on me</HI> <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">John <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">6.9.</NOTE>. <HI>Go into all the world, and preach the go&s;|pel to every creature, he that believeth and is bap|tized &s;hall be &s;aved; he that believeth not &s;hall be damned</HI> <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">Mark 16.15, 16.</NOTE>. The&s;e, are but a few of the many texts of &s;cripture, &s;hewing it the duty of all to be|lieve in Chri&s;t; all which are plainly incon&s;i&s;tent with the doctrine of a re&s;trained redemption to &s;ome few cho&s;en per&s;ons; for tho&s;e obliged to believe in Chri&s;t, are obliged to believe to the &s;aving of their &s;ouls, <HI>that believing they might have eternal life</HI> <NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">Heb. 10.39. and John <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">0.31.</NOTE>. But all to whom the go&s;pel comes are obliged to believe in Chri&s;t; either
<PB N="10" REF="016277_0010_0F9C1BAD1DE86AF8">
therefore, Chri&s;t has purcha&s;ed eternal life for all, or tho&s;e that peri&s;h are obliged to believe a lie: But to &s;ay that it is the will of God that any per|&s;on &s;hould believe a lie, or that the Holy Gho&s;t convinces men of &s;in, becau&s;e they believe not what is fal&s;e, is bla&s;phemy.</P>
<P>Now &s;ince the &s;criptures declare, that God would have all men be &s;aved, that Chri&s;t is the Saviour of the whole world, that he died for tho&s;e that peri&s;h, and that it is the duty of all to whom the go&s;pel comes to believe in him; our doctrine, viz. that God de&s;igned the mediation of Chri&s;t for all men equally, is well founded on the word of God, and mu&s;t &s;tand or tall with the &s;criptures.</P>
<P>But this doctrine will appear &s;till plainer, if we &s;pend a few moments in viewing the arguments from rea&s;on for this great go&s;pel truth.</P>
<P><HI>Argument</HI> 1. If God intended not the death of Chri&s;t for the &s;aving of any but the elect, then he never de&s;igned the &s;alvation of the far greater part of tho&s;e to whom the go&s;pel is revealed. But if &s;o, why is that time in which, by the revelation of the go&s;pel, this reprobating, this damning doc|rine was brought to light, &s;tiled the time when the goodne&s;s and love of God our &s;aviour appear|ed to mankind? Why, pray, do the angels &s;ing as in the text? Why is he &s;tiled a God rich in mercy? Why is it &s;aid that his tender mercies are over all his works? Why does the Apo&s;tle &s;ay, that God loved us fir&s;t, before we loved him; when according to this doctrine, God hated the greate&s;t part of us before we hated him, and pre|vented us, not with his ble&s;&s;ing, but with &s;ubjec|tion
<PB N="11" REF="016277_0011_0F9C1BAE59B71588">
to an eternal cur&s;e? Why does God &s;ay that he delights in mercy? Why is the day of judg|ment called a revelation of the righteous judg|ment of God? We appeal to all rea&s;onable be|ings, whether it be a righteous thing to condemn men to eternal mi&s;ery for that which it was ne|ver in their power to avoid?</P>
<P><HI>Argument</HI> 2. If Chri&s;t died for none but the elect, then he never intended to &s;ave any whom he doth not actually &s;ave. But why then does he &s;ay to the unbelieving Jews, <HI>How often would I have gathered you as a hen doth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not</HI>; and pathetically wi&s;h, that they had known in their day the things belonging to their peace. One may as well hope to reconcile light and darkne&s;s, as the&s;e words of Chri&s;t with his intention to die only for them who &s;hall actually be &s;aved.</P>
<P><HI>Argument</HI> 3. If Chri&s;t died for the elect on|ly, then the greate&s;t part of tho&s;e to whom the go&s;pel comes are not bound to believe in him; for had not the Saviour come into the world, they could not have been obliged to believe in him; but &s;urely, it is the &s;ame thing to have no Saviour come at all, as to have none for me.</P>
<P><HI>Argument</HI> 4. If Chri&s;t's mediation re&s;pects the elect only, then none can be condemned for unbelief, becau&s;e they tran&s;gre&s;s no law of God by their unbelief; for &s;urely none will &s;ay, that God commands men to believe in Chri&s;t for &s;al|vation, for whom he never intended &s;alvation by Chri&s;t. But why then does Chri&s;t tell the Jews, that if they did not believe he was the Chri&s;t they &s;hould die in their &s;ins?</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="016277_0012_0F9C1BAED93CB568"><HI>Argument</HI> 5. If Chri&s;t is a mediator for the elect only, then none can be rationally exhorted to believe in him. Not they who are not elect|ed, for Chri&s;t is no Saviour for them; not the elect, for he that knows him&s;elf to be one of that number, hath believed already, and if he does not know that he has believed, he cannot know that Chri&s;t died for him, or that it is his duty to be|lieve in Chri&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Argument</HI> 6. If Chri&s;t is not a mediator for all, then God has not provided means &s;ufficient for the &s;alvation of all; tho&s;e therefore that are condemned at la&s;t, will be condemned for that which is no &s;in: For &s;urely it is no &s;in in the creature, not to do that which none but God can do; but none but God can provide the means of &s;alvation, and &s;o every unbeliever will have a ju&s;t excu&s;e, and &s;ufficient plea why he &s;hould not be puni&s;hed, even becau&s;e he never had the means of faith. If any &s;hould &s;ay that we all had &s;trength &s;ufficient in <HI>Adam,</HI> and therefore may be dealt with as if we had it &s;till; I an&s;wer, it is fal&s;e to &s;ay, that <HI>Adam</HI> in innocency had power to repent of &s;in and believe in Chri&s;t; and what he had not he could not lo&s;e for him&s;elf or po&s;|terity. <HI>Adam</HI> had never any more power to be|lieve in Chri&s;t than we have.</P>
<P><HI>Argument</HI> 7. The doctrine that teaches that Chri&s;t died for the elect only, is de&s;tructive of al|mo&s;t all the acts of piety and virtue, and there|fore ought to be rejected with abhorrence by all that fear God. The apo&s;tle exhorts that &s;up|plications, prayers, interce&s;&s;ions, and giving of
<PB N="13" REF="016277_0013_0F9C1BB022577930">
thanks be made for all men: But if Chri&s;t did not die for all, and God would not have all men be &s;aved, the&s;e duties are ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible, nay, they would be very &s;inful. Again, it is &s;aid to be our duty to love the Lord our God; but what motive has a reprobate to love God, whom he has &s;hut out from his mercy, and left to pe|ri&s;h without remedy? And it is &s;aid to be our duty to fear God; but in order hereto, we mu&s;t be per&s;uaded that there is forgivene&s;s with him; without this there can be no religious fear of God.</P>
<P>It would be ea&s;y to enlarge, but I mu&s;t for|bear, and &s;hould now proceed to apply the &s;ub|ject, but it will perhaps be thought that &s;ome|thing further &s;hould be &s;aid in an&s;wer to the ar|guments brought by &s;ome again&s;t the doctrine of univer&s;al redemption, as I have &s;tated it in this di&s;cour&s;e. And the arguments again&s;t this doc|trine are of two kinds; fir&s;t from &s;cripture, and &s;econdly from rea&s;on <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">What is now offered under the&s;e two heads, was omitted when the &s;ermon was preached for want of time, but thought be&s;t that it &s;hould be added now.</NOTE>. As to tho&s;e pretended to be founded on &s;cripture, they are very few; and no wonder, as there is not a text in the Bi|ble, that &s;ays expre&s;sly or by nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence, that Chri&s;t died not for all, again&s;t tho&s;e many that affirm this in expre&s;s terms. But to &s;hew how vain their pretence to &s;cripture is, who deny the generality of Chri&s;t's mediation, I will brief|ly &s;tate tho&s;e their arguments that have not as yet been mentioned.</P>
<P N="1">1. They &s;ay, tho&s;e for whom Chri&s;t died may &s;ay, <HI>Who &s;hall condemn us?</HI> according to <HI>Rom.</HI> viii.

<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> There is no &s;uch propo&s;ition in the Bible as this, that all for whom Chri&s;t died may &s;ay <HI>who &s;hall condemn us,</HI> but only the per&s;ons there &s;poken of might &s;ay this, who were the &s;ons of God by adoption.</P>
<P N="2">2. They &s;ay, all tho&s;e for whom God deliver|ed up his &s;on, he together with him will freely give all things according to <HI>Rom.</HI> viii. 32. But there are many to whom God will not give all things; therefore, for none of the&s;e did God de|liver up his &s;on.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> There is no &s;uch propo&s;ition in &s;crip|ture as this, to all tho&s;e for whom God delivered up his &s;on, he will give all things; the text cited re&s;pects only us, <HI>i. e.</HI> the adopted &s;ons of God, who have the &s;pirit dwelling in them.</P>
<P N="3">3. They &s;ay, tho&s;e who by the death of Chri&s;t are reconciled to God, &s;hall be &s;aved by his life, according to <HI>Rom.</HI> v. 10. If therefore all men are reconciled to God by the death of Chri&s;t, all mu&s;t be &s;aved by his life; but all will not be &s;aved by him, therefore all are not reconciled to God.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> If it be allowed that all reconciled to God &s;hall be &s;aved, it is fal&s;e to &s;ay, that all for whom Chri&s;t died are reconciled to God, for Chri&s;t died for them when ungodly and enemies, that they might be reconciled to God: Chri&s;t did not purcha&s;e actual reconciliation for any, but conditionally for all.</P>
<P N="4">4. They &s;ay, tho&s;e for whom Chri&s;t died he loved with the greate&s;t love, this being a te&s;ti|mony
<PB N="15" REF="016277_0015_0F9C1BB18EAD9D38">
of the greate&s;t love, according to <HI>John</HI> xv. 13. but thus Chri&s;t loved not all, for he doth not apply the benefits of his death to all, therefore he died not for all.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> There is no &s;uch a&s;&s;ertion in the Bible, that tho&s;e for whom Chri&s;t died, he loved with the greate&s;t love: Chri&s;t only &s;aith, that one man &s;hews no greater love than this to another; but this he could not &s;ay of the love of his father, and of his own love to us, for God commended his love to us, in that <HI>when we were &s;inners Chri&s;t died for us, the ju&s;t for the unju&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>I have now con&s;idered all pretended from &s;crip|ture again&s;t our doctrine. I &s;hall next take a brief view of what is objected from rational accounts to the univer&s;ality of Chri&s;t's redemption.</P>
<P>Objection 1. <HI>It is not rea&s;onable to believe that Chri&s;t died in vain, but if he died for all he mu&s;t have died in vain with re&s;pect to mo&s;t.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> To &s;ay that Chri&s;t died to no purpo&s;e, or to no good end, is a great ab&s;urdity; but to &s;ay, he died in vain eventually for them who will not repent and believe in him, is none at all. For all tho&s;e acts of divine grace who&s;e efficacy de|pends on the will of man, are too often in vain through man's wickedne&s;s. <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> magnifies the divine goodne&s;s, in giving his word and ordi|nances to <HI>I&s;rael</HI>; and yet by <HI>Jeremiah</HI> God com|plains, <HI>in vain hath he made it, the pen of the &s;cribe is in vain.</HI> And again, <HI>In vain have I &s;mitten them, they have refu&s;ed to receive correction.</HI></P>
<P>Object. 2. <HI>But a general will that all men &s;hould be &s;aved, carries &s;ome marks of imperfection in it,
<PB N="16" REF="016277_0016_0F9C1BB3F7206188">
as it repre&s;ents God wi&s;hing &s;omething which he will not accompli&s;h; now an all-perfect being can wi&s;h nothing but what he can execute; and if it be fit for him to wi&s;h it, it mu&s;t be fit for him to exe|cute it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> Hark, what &s;ay the &s;criptures, for thi|ther we mu&s;t re&s;ort! <HI>Oh, that my people had hark|ened to me and I&s;rael had walked in my ways. O that thou had&s;t harkened to my commandments. Oh, that they were wi&s;e that they would con&s;ider their latter end! What could I have done more to my vineyard? How oft would I have gathered you as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings. Oh, that thou had&s;t known in this thy day the things that belong to thy peace.</HI> Will any now &s;ay, that God wills nothing but what he thinks fit to execute; the con&s;e|quence of which is, that there is no truth nor &s;in|cerity in the&s;e pathetic wi&s;hes, yea, that he is not willing any &s;hould obey his will, that do not o|bey it, that he is not unwilling tho&s;e &s;hould &s;in, whom he does not re&s;train therefrom; that he is not willing any &s;hould repent that do not repent, and that tho&s;e that die in their iniquity do nothing contrary to the will of God. Now, will any one that fears God make an objection, of which the&s;e are the plain but dreadful con&s;equences?</P>
<P>Object. 3. <HI>If Chri&s;t died for all men, and all are not &s;aved, the wi&s;dom of God mu&s;t be defective and imperfect; for to fall &s;hort of what a man in|tends, argues a deficiency in point of wi&s;dom.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> If God can intend nothing but what he performs, then when he forbid &s;in, he did not intend that any per&s;on &s;hould ab&s;tain from it who
<PB N="17" REF="016277_0017_0F9C1BB557DDBDC0">
doth not actually do &s;o: Or, when he commands repentance, holine&s;s and obedience, he does not intend that any per&s;on &s;hould repent, be holy or obedient, who is not actually &s;o: Surely men will never abide by &s;uch rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>Object. 4. <HI>If Chri&s;t died for all men, and all men are not &s;aved, then is not God omnipotent, &s;ince he could not apply to them the benefit he was willing &s;hould be procured for them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> Was it for want of power in Chri&s;t that he could do no mighty works in his own coun|try, or was it the unbelief of his countrymen? It is not for want of ability or will in God that men go without his grace, but wholly owing to the unwillingne&s;s of men to receive it. <HI>Ye will not come unto me that ye might have life. I would have purged Jeru&s;alem, but &s;he would not be purged.</HI></P>
<P>Object. 5. <HI>No man willingly pays a price of redemption for a captive, which he certainly knows the mi&s;erable man will never be the better for; Chri&s;t therefore paid no price of redemption for a|ny man, who will never be the better for it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> This objection depends entirely on this propo&s;ition, viz. that God and Chri&s;t never did, or could do, that to any per&s;ons which they knew they would never be the better for. But what can be &s;aid more openly fal&s;e than this? Did he not &s;end his &s;pirit to &s;trive with the old world, and allow them 120 years to repent in&punc; though he knew they would be no better for it? And does he not reveal his go&s;pel to men, and &s;end his amba&s;&s;adors to call them to faith and repentance, whom he knows will never be the
<PB N="18" REF="016277_0018_0F9C1BB6B2F958D0">
better for it? Is not the go&s;pel a &s;avour of death to many?</P>
<P>This is all that I have &s;een advanced again&s;t our doctrine, worth taking notice of; and from hence we may &s;ee how weak the attempt that is made again&s;t it.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now as propo&s;ed, &s;hut up the di&s;cour&s;e with a practical improvement; and this in way of addre&s;s to the re&s;pective characters in this a&s;|&s;embly. And fir&s;t to my brethren in the mini&s;try here pre&s;ent.</P>
<P><HI>Reverend Sirs,</HI> As God had no other prima|ry end in &s;ending his &s;on to be the &s;aviour of the world, or in giving him up to death, but the glorifying him&s;elf in the &s;alvation of men; &s;o in putting us into the mini&s;try, and making us his amba&s;&s;adors to a lo&s;t world, he had the &s;ame end; for we are to be workers together with him, and to this very end, that he may be glorified in the &s;alvation of tho&s;e to whom we come preach|ing the glad tidings of &s;alvation; to open to men the go&s;pel way of life, and bring them heartily to approve thereof, and yield them&s;elves unto the Lord; in a word, to per&s;uade them to re|nounce &s;in, Satan and the world, and chu&s;e God for their God, Chri&s;t for their Saviour, religion for their bu&s;ine&s;s, and Heaven for their home; is our work, and &s;hould be our great concern faithfully to do. Our own &s;alvation, certainly de|pends on our being faithful to him that has call|ed us, by exerting our&s;elves to the uttermo&s;t to glorify God; in promoting religion among men we &s;hall be &s;o, and if we are faithful, we &s;hall undoubtedly be in a mea&s;ure &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="016277_0019_0F9C1BB6CF500758">Now the doctrine we have been hearing will greatly a&s;&s;i&s;t us in our work of &s;aving men, while the contrary doctrine tends greatly to hinder, em|barra&s;s and &s;top us in this good work. This will fully appear if we con&s;ider a few things, as</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The doctrine of a general redemption layeth the greate&s;t obligations on men to fear and &s;erve the Lord; for if God thus loved us fir&s;t, &s;urely we are bound to love him; if Chri&s;t thus bought us with the price of his blood, we ought to glorify him with our &s;ouls and bodies which are his. God's mercifully providing a &s;aviour for all, a&s;&s;ures every one that there is forgivene&s;s with him, and this is the only foundation for religion among &s;inners, and affords the mo&s;t powerful argument for their yielding them&s;elves to him; of this St. Paul was aware, and therefore &s;ays, <HI>I be&s;eech you brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye pre&s;ent your bodies a living &s;acrifice holy, ac|ceptable unto God, which is your rea&s;onable &s;er|vice.</HI> But how can one be moved to &s;erve God in con&s;ideration of his great mercy to him, who may doubt whether ever God intended mercy for him? And if the redemption of Chri&s;t re&s;|pects only an elect remnant, may not the great|e&s;t part doubt of God's mercy and good will to them? Or how can we urge men from the con|&s;ideration of God's great mercy to them, to yield them&s;elves to him, if we may doubt whether e|ver God intended mercy for them? And doubt &s;o we mu&s;t, if Chri&s;t's redemption be not general.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The doctrine of univer&s;al redemption tends to promote the glory of God far beyond the
<PB N="20" REF="016277_0020_0F9C1BB7D3DB9E40">
contrary doctrine: For if to redeem any doth magnify his goodne&s;s, to redeem many doth in|crea&s;e it, but to redeem all doth advance it to the highe&s;t pitch. Therefore the angels &s;ing <HI>glory to God in the highe&s;t!</HI> The more are benefited the greater is the glory of the benefactor.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The doctrine of a general redemption doth be&s;t in&s;truct us how to imitate the divine goodne&s;s our&s;elves, in &s;eeking and procuring as much as in us lies the good of all men. We have men to deal with of very different characters and tempers, and in order to &s;ave men, we mu&s;t be|come all things to all men, plea&s;e all for their good, for edification, and often deny our&s;elves that we may &s;ave others. Now what &s;o powerful to excite us hereto, as to con&s;ider that Chri&s;t our ma&s;ter has ta&s;ted death for every man, and God our father mo&s;t earne&s;tly de&s;ires the &s;alvation of every man? Further, we are to teach and exhort all, to whom we come preaching the kingdom of God, <HI>to love their enemies, ble&s;s tho&s;e that cur&s;e them, do good to tho&s;e that hate them, and pray for tho&s;e who de&s;pitefully u&s;e them,</HI> &amp;c. that they may be the children of their heavenly father: But our doctrine furni&s;hes us with the mo&s;t powerful ar|guments to pre&s;s this exten&s;ive charity on our people; nor could we have a face to urge them to love all, if we thought the bowels of God's love and mercy were confined to a few, le&s;t they &s;hould exceed their pattern: For if God's love and mercy be as &s;ome pretend, limited to a few, then to love all, would not be to be like, but un|like to him.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="016277_0021_0F9C1BB91A78DEE8"><HI>Fourthly,</HI> Our doctrine is of great u&s;e to us in carrying on the Lord's work, as it admini&s;ters ju&s;t ground of comfort to the greate&s;t &s;inners when under awakenings. We have &s;ome times to deal with &s;inners who, under the terror of God's threatenings and the convictions of their own con&s;ciences, are crying out <HI>O mi&s;erable men that we are, what &s;hall we do?</HI> Would to God it were oftener the ca&s;e. Now when &s;uch as the&s;e apply to us, it would be but little comfort, or ra|ther none at all; to tell them that Chri&s;t died on|ly for the elect, and that God will only give grace and mercy to a &s;mall remnant of men; &s;ince then the odds again&s;t them would be great, that they are not of that little number, and &s;o their hope but little if any at all: But if we can a&s;&s;ure them that Chri&s;t ta&s;ted death for every man, is the pro|pitiation for the &s;ins of the whole world; that he is interceding now in heaven for them, that God will graciou&s;ly admit of the return of every pro|digal to him, and while a great way off, will, like the father of the prodigal, run to meet them with &s;upplies of grace and &s;trength; that he exceeding|ly rejoiceth at the return of every lo&s;t &s;heep, has told us as he lives he takes the greate&s;t plea&s;ure in it, and that he has been thus long &s;uffering to|wards them in particular, becau&s;e unwilling they &s;hould peri&s;h: How will this excite joy, grati|tude and prai&s;e in the poor trembling creatures, and &s;tir them up to follow on to know the Lord!</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> The doctrine of univer&s;al redemption gives life and energy to all our exhortations to &s;inners to turn and live, whereas the contrary per|&s;ua&s;ion
<PB N="22" REF="016277_0022_0F9C1BB9DD5B4628">
robs them of their &s;trength: For if God did not will the &s;alvation of all, if Chri&s;t did not die for all, our exhortations to our whole congre|gations to believe and repent would be vain and &s;inful; for then we &s;hould exhort many, perhaps mo&s;t, to do what God was not willing they &s;hould do, and &s;hould inform them that he wills what he doth not. We could not put the que&s;tion to them, <HI>Why will ye die?</HI> if we knew nothing to the contrary but that it is the will and decree of God that they &s;hould die; nor could we blame them for neglecting the great &s;alvation, if we had no a&s;&s;urance it was de&s;igned for them&punc; But our doctrine enables us, with a good face, to enquire of &s;inners, why they de&s;pi&s;e the riches of that goodne&s;s which was de&s;igned to lead them to re|pentance, why they will die when God is &s;o un|willing they &s;hould die. It would be ea&s;y to en|large, but I forbear, not being &s;o vain as to think of in&s;tructing you, Sirs, in any thing before un|known to you, but only to &s;tir you up, together with my&s;elf, to that faithfulne&s;s now in the Lord's work, which will be our comfort in the pre&s;ent time, and give us boldne&s;s in the day of Chri&s;t, for who&s;e coming let us be con&s;tantly looking, that he may appear to our &s;alvation.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now addre&s;s my&s;elf to him who is this day to be &s;eperated to the work of the Chri&s;tian mini&s;try in this place.</P>
<P><HI>Dear Sir,</HI> It is at your reque&s;t that I perform this public part to day, you will therefore excu&s;e a free addre&s;s. The important day, Sir, is now advanced, in which you are renewedly to give

And in the fir&s;t place, take heed to <HI>your&s;elf,</HI> look to the furniture of <HI>your own</HI> mind, and &s;ee that <HI>you</HI> have an inward &s;tore, are furni&s;hed with the gifts and graces of God's &s;pirit, and e&s;pecially that the &s;pirit of love dwells richly in <HI>you, love to God and love to men</HI>; this will be as oil to the wheels of <HI>obedience,</HI> this will make <HI>your work ea&s;y</HI> and <HI>plea&s;ant,</HI> and you <HI>may ta&s;te the comfort of your labours as you go along</HI>: But without this <HI>your work</HI> will be <HI>your burden,</HI> and you will <HI>drag on heavily</HI> in it: Nor can it be expected that you will be <HI>faithful in your work</HI> unle&s;s <HI>your heart</HI> is in it.

<P>Take heed al&s;o to this flock of which you are now to take the charge, feed them with the &s;incere milk of the word, go before them in a holy conver&s;ation, give them an example of love to God and man, of humility, fear and heavenly

When therefore he &s;ays unto the wicked; <HI>O wicked man thou &s;halt &s;urely die,</HI> do not be angry with him, for nece&s;&s;ity is laid upon him, and woe to him if he neglect to warn the wicked: When he tells <HI>prayerle&s;s families</HI> and <HI>prayerle&s;s per&s;ons,</HI> that God will pour out his wrath on them, believe it and reform, when he tells &s;uch as turn their backs on the Lord's table, that in &s;o doing they <HI>practi|cally deny Chri&s;t,</HI> believe him and do &s;o no more; when he tells &s;uch as neglect bapti&s;m for their children, that they are liable to be di&s;owned by Chri&s;t for want of his mark, and in danger of peri&s;hing with their hou&s;es for want of an ark, believe him and reform; when he tells you that you were <HI>every one</HI> bought with the precious blood of Chri&s;t, that you are not <HI>your own,</HI> but his that bought you, that you are bound to glorify and &s;erve him, and that your not doing &s;o, but living in &s;in, is again&s;t the will of God, who de|&s;ires the &s;alvation of <HI>every one of you,</HI> though you are trampling under foot the blood of his dear &s;on, which was &s;hed for all. Do not object hereto, tho&s;e popi&s;h opinions of the ab&s;olute elec|tion of a definite number to eternal life, and Chri&s;t's dying only for them. The&s;e are doctrines mid|wifed into the world by dreaming monks about the ninth century, and in their con&s;equences de|&s;tructive of all religion.</P>
