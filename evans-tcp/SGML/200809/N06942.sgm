<HEAD>A LETTER, TO THE Rev. Mr. DAVID BOSTWICK. At NEW-YORK.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Reverend and dear Brother,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MOST gladly I embrace the pre&s;ent Opportunity to an&s;wer you Reque&s;t, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> That I would give you a brief Account of the Rev. Mr. <HI>Occum'</HI>s Education, Character, and fitne&s;s for his de&s;igned Mi&s;&s;ion:&mdash;Mo&s;t gladly,&mdash;becau&s;e, I am not without Hope, that it may have &s;ome Influence, to promote one of the mo&s;t important and beneficent De&s;igns in the World: As I am well a&s;&s;ured it will, if by Means thereof, any well di&s;po&s;ed Per&s;ons &s;hall be excited to contribute the more liberally toward upholding and &s;up|porting Mr. <HI>Occum,</HI> in his Mi&s;&s;ion among the aboriginal Natives of <HI>America;</HI> and any of them by the Ble&s;&s;ing of God upon his Labours, for that Purpo&s;e &s;hould be truly evangelized.</P>
<P>To make U&s;e of Mr. <HI>Occum'</HI>s own Phra&s;eology, He was brought up a <HI>Heathen</HI> till he entered upon the eigh|teenth Year of his Age: At which Age, he began to &s;eek after an increa&s;ing Acquaintance with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tongue; and to labour after being indoctrinated in the Chri&s;tian Religion. But before the Expiration of this Year, (which he calls the Year of Salvation to him) he &s;ays, that he can but hope, "it plea&s;ed GOD to reveal his Son JESUS CHRIST, in him and to him," in a
<PB N="vi" REF="008808_0003_102FEF9716DCDFF0">
&s;piritual and &s;aving Manner. He had at this Time, a clear, powerful, and practical Conviction of the moral Pollution of his Nature, and of the great Defilement of his Life, by actual Sin; of his lo&s;t, mi&s;erable and undone State by Nature; of his utter Inability to liberate him&s;elf from this deplorable Condition; of his Unworthine&s;s to be help'd, and of the Ju&s;tice of GOD in his final and eternal Rejection. And having with deep Solicitude, and Anxiou&s;ne&s;s of Mind, turned every Stone, and tried every Expedient within the Compa&s;s of his Power, by the U&s;e of Means, in order to obtain Salvation, found thereupon, an ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of re&s;igning him&s;elf up to GOD, as rightful Lord, and an infinite Sovereign, who might &s;ave or de&s;troy him forever, as he plea&s;ed: And thus &s;ubmiting to GOD, as merciful, and could &s;ave, and ju&s;t if he ca&s;t off and de&s;troyed; at this &s;olemn Sea&s;on, he believes, the holy Spirit illuminated his Mind, and enabled him to behold the divinely glorious Objects of Faith, and inclined him to elect and choo&s;e GOD, as his la&s;t End, and chief Good, through the divine Mediator CHRIST JESUS. From which Time to the pre&s;ent, he &s;eriou&s;ly profe&s;&s;es, to have found a great Change wrought in the Temper, Bias, and Inclination of his Soul; turn|ing of it from Sin to Holine&s;s, from the Creature to GOD. He ob&s;erves, that among other Things, opening to View at this Time; he &s;aw in an affecting Light, the infinite Rea&s;onablene&s;s of dedicating him&s;elf, entirely and ab&s;olutely, to GOD the FATHER, SON and HOLY GHOST, as his Owner, to be di&s;po&s;ed of by him, as his Ruler, to obey him, as his Benefactor and chief Good, thankfully to depend on him, and love him, and live to him, as his ultimate End. And al&s;o, that while he looked upon his <HI>Kinsfolk,</HI> "as peri&s;hing for Lack of Vi&s;ion," he found within him&s;elf a bleeding Tenderne&s;s of Heart, and unut|terable Bowels of Compa&s;&s;ion toward them: Which excited in him, ardent De&s;ires after becoming under Advantage to promote their In&s;truction, in the Know|ledge of the Chri&s;tian Religion, and to befriend them with Regard to their eternal Salvation.&mdash;Hearing that

the Rev. Mr. <HI>Eleazar Wheelock,</HI> Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel at <HI>Lebanon,</HI> had a Number of Youth under his Care and Tuition, Mr. <HI>Occum,</HI> earne&s;tly reque&s;ted of him, the Favour of becoming one of the Number; which, after &s;ome Examination was readily granted. Mr. <HI>Occum,</HI> lived about three Years with the Rev. Mr. <HI>Wheelock,</HI> and one Year with the Rev. Mr. <HI>Pumroy,</HI> Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel at <HI>Hebron,</HI>&mdash;pro&s;ecuting the Study of the <HI>Engli&s;h, Latin</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI> Languages; and al&s;o con|tracted &s;ome Acquaintance with the <HI>Hebrew.</HI>&mdash;During this Time, Mr. <HI>Occum,</HI> made &s;uch Progre&s;s in Learning, that he was &s;o well fitted for Admittance into College, (which was de&s;igned) that he doubtle&s;s would have entered upon his &s;econd Year, at his fir&s;t Admi&s;&s;ion. But through inten&s;e Application to Study, he very much weakened his Eye-Sight, &s;o that 'twas judged prudent for him to de&s;i&s;t from &s;evere Study for a Time: After &s;ome Months Trial, finding his Eye-Sight &s;till remained &s;o weak as not to admit of hard Study, 'twas thought advi&s;eable, that he &s;hould enter upon the Bu&s;ine&s;s of keeping School: Which he accordingly did among the <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Montauk,</HI> who live upon the Ea&s;t End of this <HI>I&s;land,</HI> to whom he has been very beneficial, e&s;pe|cially to the Youth and Children <HI>there.</HI></P>
<P>ABOUT a Year and a Half before Mr. <HI>Occum'</HI>s Ordi|nation, the Reverend A&s;&s;ociation of <HI>Windham</HI> County, in the Colony of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> gave him a <HI>Licence</HI> to preach, as a Candidate for the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try, and referred him to <HI>our</HI> Pre&s;bytery for Ordination, in ca&s;e <HI>we</HI> thought proper. While the&s;e Things were tran&s;acting, &s;everal Letters came to Hand, from our worthy and dear Friend, the Rev. Mr. <HI>Davies,</HI> (&s;ince Pre&s;ident of <HI>New-Jer&s;ey</HI> College, and we tru&s;t now in Glory) warmly urging Mr. <HI>Occum'</HI>s Ordination, with a View to his going upon a Mi&s;&s;ion among the <HI>Cherokees;</HI> but they taking an unhappy Turn, and engaging in a War with us, that De&s;ign was ob&s;tructed. We received the Infor|mation of the perfidious Conduct of the <HI>Cherokee</HI> Nation, a few Days before the Time appointed by the Pre&s;bytery
<PB REF="008808_0005_102FEF9D73595ED8">
for Mr. <HI>Occum'</HI>s Ordination; neverthele&s;s, that was not preventive of it; for a Motion had been made for his entering upon a Mi&s;&s;ion among the <HI>Mohawks;</HI> and there are &s;everal Tribes of <HI>Indians</HI> on the Continent, and al&s;o upon this <HI>I&s;land,</HI> that he could mini&s;ter unto occa&s;ionally; and it was hoped that GOD in his Providence, in due Time, would open an effectual Door for his U&s;e|fulne&s;s, among them who dwell in the <HI>Wilderne&s;s.</HI>&mdash;Whereupon, the Pre&s;bytery finding of him, upon due Examination, po&s;&s;e&s;t of a hopeful Mea&s;ure of nece&s;&s;ary Qualifications therefor, proceeded to &s;eparate him to the Work of the &s;acred Mini&s;try, according to Go&s;pel-Rule and Order.</P>
<P>FROM which Time to the pre&s;ent, he has principally preached to the <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Montauk;</HI> who, I fear will &s;oon perceive &s;ome lamentable Effects of his Departure from them.</P>
<P>'TIS now eleven or twelve Year &s;ince Mr. <HI>Occum</HI> has officiated in the Quality of a School-Ma&s;ter; during which Time, he has been making Proficiency in the various Parts of Learning, which &s;erve to qualify, in their Place, for preaching the Go&s;pel, which all along he has had in View. But his Progre&s;s in Learning has been much retarded, and his U&s;efulne&s;s greatly embarra&s;&s;ed, for Want of due Support, and thereby Freedom from wordly Cares and Avocations; yet he has improved Time with &s;o much Vigilance and Indu&s;try, as to become po&s;&s;e&s;t of a good Degree of u&s;eful Learning; and has been improving to good Purpo&s;e in the Chri&s;tian Life. He is endued with no &s;mall Degree of Knowledge in the holy Scriptures; and in the whole of his Deportment, he exhibits ample Evidence, that he has a living Faith within, of divine Truths.</P>
<P>As a Preacher of the Go&s;pel, he &s;eems always to have before his Eye, the great End of the Mini&s;try, the Glory of GOD, and the Salvation of Men. As the Matter of his Sermons is de&s;igned for the good of Souls; &s;o his Way of Expre&s;&s;ion is proper to that End. He u&s;es great Plainne&s;s of Speech, and makes clo&s;e Application of Truth
<PB N="ix" REF="008808_0006_102FEFA00596BD88">
to the Con&s;cience; which you well know Sir, that although this is not &s;o agreeable to tho&s;e, who are loth to have their Minds impre&s;&s;ed with a ju&s;t Sen&s;e of the Weight of Things eternal; nor &s;o plea&s;ing to them who form a Ta&s;te rather for the Flowers of Oratory, than for the &s;ub&s;tantial Food of the Sanctuary; yet 'tis that Method of preaching which is be&s;t adapted to do good to the Souls of Men; and upon which, the LORD is plea&s;ed to command his Ble&s;&s;ing. Tho&s;e, who have had Oppor|tunity to ob&s;erve, take Notice, that his Manner of Expre&s;|&s;ion, when he preaches to the <HI>Indians,</HI> is va&s;tly more natural and free, clear and eloquent, quick and powerful, than 'tis wont to be, when he preaches to others. As an In&s;tructor of the <HI>Indians,</HI> he makes frequent U&s;e of apt and &s;ignificant Similitudes, to convey and illu&s;trate Truth: Such a Method of conveying <HI>Ideas,</HI> you know, Sir, is natural to <HI>Indians</HI> in general, and therefore, doubt|le&s;s, as plea&s;ing as 'tis natural.</P>
<P>IN Prayer, his Solemnity and Reverence are becoming one that beholds him who is invi&s;ible: He appears eminently enrich'd with a Spirit of Adoption; and &s;eems often indulged with much holy Freedom of Acce&s;s to the Throne of Grace. His Mind is chiefly intent upon, and his Heart much drawn forth, in De&s;ires after tho&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings which are infinitely the mo&s;t excellent and important.</P>
<P>HE adds Force to the Doctrines he preaches, by the prevailing Charms of an un&s;potted Life, and a Conver|&s;ation as becomes the Go&s;pel. From the Time that he hopefully experienced a &s;aving Change, to this very Day, he has been pre&s;erved from that Sin, which &s;eems to be the <HI>Indians' Con&s;titution Sin;</HI> and from every Sin, that is commonly called &s;candalous: In all Re&s;pects, he has a negative Goodne&s;s; and &s;hines in the po&s;itive Beauties of Holine&s;s. In &s;hort, he is an Ornament to the Chri&s;tian Religion, and the Glory of the <HI>Indian</HI> Nation,</P>
<P>MR. <HI>Occum</HI> is well acquainted with the Nature and E&s;&s;ence of Religion, as it eminently con&s;i&s;ts in a Confor|mity of the whole Soul to the moral Excellencies of GOD,
<PB N="x" REF="008808_0007_102FEFA2B6D50490">
and his Will. He is &s;ound in Principle, and well e&s;tabli&s;hed in the Belief of divine Truth; and is far from re&s;ting in a naked and cold A&s;&s;ent thereto, he labours after, and appears actually po&s;&s;e&s;t of a good Degree of the Life and power of Godline&s;s; as a Man, judiciou&s;ly zealous and happily free from an enthu&s;ia&s;tick Turn of Mind; an Attainment, we believe, Sir, as truly excellent as 'tis u&s;eful and r<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">e. He is indeed well plea&s;ed with rai&s;ed and holy religious Affections, as the Re&s;ult of a proportionable Degree of Illumination of Mind, and as they powerfully influence to practical Holine&s;s, and excite to a permanent Devotedne&s;s to the Service and Glory of GOD. There is therefore, ju&s;t Ground to believe, that as an In&s;tructor of the <HI>Heathen,</HI> he will teach them the Truth as it is in JESUS; that he will be far from re&s;ting of them in the <HI>Form</HI> of Knowledge, and mere external Reformation; without pre&s;&s;ing upon them the ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of Regeneration, by the holy Spirit's Opera|tion; and thereupon, the Fruits of evangelical and univer&s;al Holine&s;s.</P>
<P>AND now, Sir, from the&s;e broken Hints, and that agreeable per&s;onal Interview, I &s;uppo&s;e you will likely have with Mr. <HI>Occum,</HI> when the&s;e Lines come to Hand, you will no Doubt, judge for your&s;elf, as to his Qualifi|cations and Fitne&s;s for the Mi&s;&s;ion he is entering upon.</P>
<P>MY known Affection to Mr. <HI>Occum,</HI> may perhaps incline &s;ome to conclude, that I am prejudiced in his Favour, and therefore am exce&s;&s;ive in giving the&s;e Sketches of his Character: 'Tis true, that I am not a&s;hamed the World &s;hould know, that my Heart loves him; that I rejoice in the Grace of GOD conferred upon him; that I admire the Pearl of Go&s;pel Grace, that is <HI>&s;et,</HI> not in the Heart of a Nobleman, but in the Heart of an <HI>Indian,</HI> born a <HI>Pagan;</HI> where it di&s;plays a &s;prightly Beam, may be of &s;ignal Service, and afford a Fund of U&s;efulne&s;s; and that I &s;eek to promote his being under Advantage to do much Service in his Day, by what I now write; but then I ri&s;que my Character upon it with tho&s;e Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel, and private Chri&s;tians, who
<PB N="xi" REF="008808_0008_102FEFA5913A04D8">
are mo&s;t acquainted with Mr. <HI>Occum,</HI> that, (&s;o far as I know) I have written no more than what is ju&s;t, and the real Truth, with Re&s;pect to him.</P>
<P>I am apt to believe, Sir, that in the Reque&s;t you exhibit,&mdash;you &s;eek not &s;o much your own Satisfaction, (having before now heard &s;o much in Mr. <HI>Occum'</HI>s Favour) as the Information of tho&s;e, who would gladly be informed what Encouragement there is to promote him in his Mi&s;&s;ion, on Account of his Qualifications therefore: And that you propo&s;e as a &s;pecial End, an Incentive to the benevolent and truly generous Spirit of Chri&s;tianity, that nothing of an outward Nature may be wanting, which may be conducive to promote his impor|tant and glorious Emba&s;&s;y. This, Sir, I hope will &s;ufficiently ju&s;tify your Reque&s;t, and my Compliance, in giving &s;o much of the Character of a Man yet in the State of &s;o great Imperfection, and in a World of &s;o much Temptation, as this in which we at pre&s;ent live. We have, doubtle&s;s, often thought, when we have beheld for a Time, &s;hining Appearances, and hopeful re&s;plen|dent Virtues, at length overca&s;t with the di&s;mal Gloom of Error in Doctrine, or Scandal in Practice; that 'tis enough to &s;ay of the be&s;t Man upon Earth, by Way of Encomium, "All Things as yet appear well and excel|lent, and we have &s;ufficient Rea&s;on to hope they will do &s;o:" And thus much I may truly &s;ay, with Re&s;pect to our dear Brother Mr <HI>Occum.</HI> Amid&s;t all that Re&s;pect and Honour he receives from many, I am well a&s;&s;ured, that he has &s;ome particular Friends, who ob&s;erve to him the Danger he is in of receiving Injury by that bu&s;y Sin Pride; not becau&s;e they &s;ee the Appearance of it in him, but as &s;uppo&s;ing <HI>Satan</HI> very active in his Temptations, and that he would exert him&s;elf more to effect his falling into Sin, preventive of his U&s;efulne&s;s, than he would to procure the Fall of twenty other Chri&s;tians, not Half &s;o likely to act a Part de&s;tructive to his Kingdom. Mr. <HI>Occum,</HI> is not unapprehen&s;ive of Danger from this Quar|ter; he receives with becoming Re&s;pect, and retains with a watchful Eye, that needful Exhortation to all
<PB N="xii" REF="008808_0009_102FEFA718508490">
Chri&s;tians, "Let him that &s;tands take Heed lea&s;t he fall." His Heart &s;ays <HI>Amen,</HI> to that divine Sentence, &s;ummarily expre&s;&s;ive of the whole De&s;ign of the Go&s;pel, "Let him that glorieth, glory in the Lord." With Plea&s;ure he adapts that Declaration of the Apo&s;tle, &s;o de&s;criptive of Self-emptine&s;s,&mdash;"I am, what I am, by the Grace of GOD:" May &s;uch Grace-exalting Language ever have a genuine Flow, from his and our Hearts!</P>
<P>IT yet remains that I ob&s;erve, that Mr. <HI>Occum</HI> has a Family, con&s;i&s;ting of a Wife and &s;ix Children; he has one Son at School, under the Care and In&s;truction of the Rev. Mr. <HI>Wheelock:</HI> (who has a con&s;iderable Number of <HI>Indian</HI> Lads under his Tuition, that promi&s;e well for eminent U&s;efulne&s;s in their Day, by the Ble&s;&s;ing of GOD.) From the fir&s;t of Mr <HI>Occum'</HI>s coming to <HI>Montauk,</HI> he has been &s;o faithfully engaged in keeping School, that he has been able to do but little for the Support of his Family: He has indeed received about Twenty Pounds <HI>per Annum,</HI> from the Gentlemen Commi&s;&s;ioners in <HI>Bo&s;ton;</HI>&mdash;and a few private Donations, from particular Friends, all which, hath in no due Mea&s;ure been equal to the nece&s;&s;ary Expences of his Family; &s;o that in order to it's Support, he is become much involv'd in Debt; and therefore he &s;tands in Need of con&s;iderable charitable and liberal Donations, in order to the Di&s;charge of Debts already nece&s;&s;arily contracted, as well as for the pre&s;ent Support of his Family, and for his own Expences, while engaged in his Mi&s;&s;ion.&mdash;It verily &s;eems a Thou&s;and Pities, that Mr. <HI>Occum'</HI>s U&s;efulne&s;s &s;hould be flung away, for the Want of his due Support; e&s;pecially in this Day, in which a very glorious Pro&s;pect opens to View, for evangelizing Multitudes of the <HI>Heathen,</HI> and thereby, for his doing much for GOD's Honour, and Men's Salvation. While there are &s;o many Chri&s;tians, who daily ply the Throne of Grace, and pray for the magnificent Enlargement of the divine REDEEMER's Kingdom among Men; we hope, we mu&s;t in Charity hope, that their liberal Donations, to promote the Propagation of the joyful Tidings of Sal|vation among the Heathen, will agree and corre&s;pond with
<PB N="xiii" REF="008808_0010_102FEFA9964AD538">
their &s;olemn Prayers: Surely we need not he&s;itate a Moment, whether 'tis po&s;&s;ible to honour GOD, in a more excellent Way, with our worldly Sub&s;tance.&mdash;</P>
<P>AND now, my dear Sir, I can &s;carce lay my Pen a&s;ide, 'til I have taken the Liberty, and received the Plea&s;ure, of expre&s;&s;ing &s;ome of our joyous Pro&s;pects, our harmo|nizing Hopes, and our hearty Wi&s;hes. We receive the Information as well authenticated, that the <HI>Oneida Indians</HI> (to whom Mr. <HI>Occum</HI> is going) make the fir&s;t Motion them&s;elves, and earne&s;tly reque&s;t that a Go&s;pel Mini&s;ter may be &s;ent among them; they promi&s;e to receive him with Joy, to treat him with Re&s;pect, and to hear him with Candour. They have already collected two or three Hundred <HI>Dollars,</HI> which they De&s;ign, (with others to be collected) to improve for erecting a Meeting-Hou&s;e, that therein they may unite in the Wor&s;hip of the true and only GOD. They hope their Cou&s;ins the <HI>Tu&s;caroras</HI> will join with them in receiving the Go&s;pel: So that the Pro&s;pect is hopeful, that GOD has a De&s;ign of &s;pecial Mercy towards them. And upon the agreeable Suppo&s;ition, that the Go&s;pel &s;hould become the Power of GOD to their Salvation, 'tis quite hopeful the ble&s;&s;ed Leaven will &s;pread, and be diffu&s;ed far and wide among the <HI>Heathen</HI> Nations: And how "this Grain of Mu&s;tard-Seed may grow, and increa&s;e and &s;pread," GOD only knows. When we take a View of the &s;ignal Succe&s;&s;es the LORD OF HOSTS, hath given to <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> and <HI>American</HI> Forces, e&s;pecially when we call to Mind the moral Impediments that were in the Way thereof, and the Manner in which GOD hath wrought, the Wonder and the Pro&s;pect grows upon us; that he hath a De&s;ign at this Time, to &s;pread the the Name and Fame of the glorious and dear IMMANUEL among the <HI>Heathen,</HI> in the&s;e Ends of the Earth.</P>
<P>WE rejoice in Hope, that all tho&s;e who are repleni&s;h'd with generous and active Zeal for the Glory of GOD, the Honour of CHRIST, and the Salvation of Men, will &s;oon &s;hare in the &s;ublime Joy and Satisfaction of hearing, that they "who dwell in the Wilderne&s;s," hear of, tru&s;t in,
<PB N="xiv" REF="008808_0011_102FEFAC35352F70">
bow before, and yield unfeigned Subjection to the exalted King of <HI>Zion.</HI> And as conducive thereto, may we not hope, that a generous Scheme will &s;oon be &s;et on Foot, for forming a <HI>Society</HI> in the&s;e Parts, to receive Sub&s;crip|tions and Contributions, with De&s;ign to promote the Education of <HI>Indian</HI> Youth, the Support of School-Ma&s;ters among the <HI>Indians,</HI> the Di&s;tribution of u&s;eful Books, and in due Time Bibles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and e&s;pecially, with a De&s;ign to promote the Propagation of the Go&s;pel among the <HI>Heathen,</HI> by the due Support of well qualified <HI>Mi&s;&s;ionaries,</HI> for that beneficent and glorious Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>WHEN we recollect the tragic Scenes of Years pa&s;t, our Forts demoli&s;hed or burnt to A&s;hes, our Armies cut to Pieces, our Countrymen, in Numbers, butchered and mangled;&mdash;and call to Mind, how the Voice of Lamen|tation and Woe was heard in our Streets!

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>ALTHO' &s;oon after the Delivery of the en&s;uing Sermon, undeniable Importunity prevailed upon me to con&s;ent to its Publication by the <HI>Pre&s;s,</HI> yet I deferr'd for a Time, as hoping divine Pro|vidence would open a Door for Mr. <HI>Occum,</HI> to enter upon a Mi&s;&s;ion among the &s;avage Nations in the Wilderne&s;s: And that Hope not being in vain, the Sermon under Pro|mi&s;e, as now more fitly timed, comes to Hand from the <HI>Pre&s;s.</HI> Having a&s;&s;erted therein &s;ome Things diametri|cally oppo&s;ite to that Scheme of Principles which &s;ome Men embrace, I &s;hall meet with no Di&s;appointment, if I come under their Cen&s;ure. All Men don't &s;ee Things in the &s;ame Point of View; yet 'tis a common Profe&s;|&s;ion, we mu&s;t think for our&s;elves.
<Q><L><HI>Hanc venian petimu&s;que damu&s;que vici&s;&s;im.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>IN the following Sermon I have freely declared it as my Opinion, that Men who enter upon the holy Mini&s;try, ought to know the LORD JESUS CHRIST &s;avingly. If any &s;hould cen&s;ure me, as chargeable with Arrogancy, think that I a&s;&s;ert Points too boldly, and that I affect Singu|larity: I have this to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> in general, that had I aimed at being a Man-plea&s;er, I might have e&s;caped their Cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>I freely acknowledge, that many who agree with me in point of Principle, would doubtle&s;s have done far greater Ju&s;tice to the Subject, and have handled it to va&s;tly better Advantage, I &s;aid that Days &s;hould &s;peak, and multitude of Years &s;hould teach Knowledge. I found
<PB N="ii" REF="008808_0015_102FEFB93551EED0">
no An&s;wer; the Stage being clear, I &s;aid I would &s;hew mine Opinion.
<Q><L><HI>In publico di&s;crimine omnis Homo miles e&s;t.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>When I preach'd the Sermon, I had ju&s;t Rea&s;on to fear, that a Decay of the Life and Power of Godline&s;s among us, and the Prevalency of <HI>Arminian</HI> Principles in &s;ome Places, would unhappily prepare the Way for &s;ome Men to grow more bold than ever, in oppo&s;ing divine Truth, and experimental Religion; and as a native Con&s;equence, the next Thing would be their open and warm Oppo&s;ition to the Examination of Candidates for the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try, as to their experimental Acquain|tance with Religion. For if Men can once imagine, that the Go&s;pel does not require &s;aving Grace, or which is the &s;ame Thing, the &s;aving Knowledge of the LORD, as a nece&s;&s;ary Qualification in Candidates,&mdash;what &s;hould hin|der, but that, as <HI>Arminians,</HI> they drop all Pretence to the Examination of Candidates, upon the Point of their experimental Acquaintance with divine Truth, by effi|cacious and &s;overeign Grace. In the View of the&s;e, and &s;uch like Things (&s;adly ominious to the Church of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI>) I was, and am willing, according to my &s;mall Ability, and Sphere of Influence to give a Caveat again&s;t threatening Errors, to declare Truth for the E&s;tabli&s;h|ment of &s;ome, and to offer Matter of Conviction to others: And whether it be judged too a&s;&s;uming, or not, I am as yet apprehen&s;ive, that I did not fear where there is no Danger.</P>
<P>IF cen&s;ured as a&s;&s;erting this, and other Points too boldly, &s;mall Apology mu&s;t &s;uffice. I own real Mode&s;ty in a&s;&s;erting Points properly dubious, to be graceful; but fal&s;e Mode&s;ty, concealing or betraying the Truths of the Go&s;pel, is abominable. "I have believed," and a&s;&s;ign'd the Rea&s;ons why I thus believe, and have &s;poken plainly, and who&s;oever will, may call this &s;peaking boldly. As a Chri&s;tian Mini&s;ter, I think my&s;elf under the &s;tronge&s;t Obligations to &s;peak our my Principles openly, and &s;o hone&s;tly: And as a Believer to dec<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters"> the important
<PB N="iii" REF="008808_0016_102FEFBAC1E8EFF8">
Truths of the Go&s;pel of my LORD and SAVIOUR, boldly. Let him that he&s;itates, and cannot an&s;wer this Que&s;tion, "What is Truth?" Speak doubtfully. Let <HI>Arminians</HI> &s;culk and peep in the Dark, and as well as they can by un&s;anctified Rea&s;on, defend their unhallowed Principles, which cannot bear the glorious Light of Divine revealed Truth. Let Trimmers with the Times, ob&s;erve their needful Decorum, and be &s;ure to &s;peak mode&s;tly, and with a bright Eye watch narrowly, or they may lo&s;e their beloved Popularity. But let the Mini&s;ters of the enthron'd SAVIOUR CHRIST JESUS the LORD, who know Go&s;pel Truths in their Life-giving and transforming Power, as illuminated by the HOLY GHOST, "Preach the Kingdom of GOD, and teach tho&s;e Things which concern the LORD JESUS CHRIST with all Confidence." When pernicious Errors are advanced and di&s;puted for, and important Truths rejected and di&s;puted again&s;t; with Zeal awaken'd to Flame we will to &s;peak our Opinions, with the Rea&s;ons of them, with an undaunted Parrhe&s;ia, with a noble Boldne&s;s, whil&s;t we plead the precious Cau&s;e of GOD, and dear <HI>Zion.</HI> When Truths that greatly concern the Honour of GOD, the Glory of CHRIST, and the Salvation of Men, are concealed or betrayed, given up or oppo&s;e; can the Mini&s;ters of the living Word, appear as void of &s;acred Fervor, as lifele&s;s Statutes? Can they imagine that GOD or his Prophets, that CHRIST or his Apo&s;tles, in&s;tructed Men in the modi&s;h Art of keeping Silence? Or can they dream, that Love Divine &s;ent Preachers among Men to palliate Go&s;pel Truths? No; &s;urely. We have renounced the hidden Things of Di&s;hone&s;ty:&mdash;We &s;peak as in the Sight of GOD:&mdash;We have the Te&s;timony of JESUS to keep us in Countenance, and are not a&s;hamed of his Go&s;pel,&mdash;which giveth Bold|ne&s;s again&s;t that univer&s;al Fire, which &s;hall melt the Elements, and &s;hrivel up the Heavens like a Roll of Parchment.</P>
<P>IF cen&s;ured, as holding an Opinion for the &s;ake of Singularity, I di&s;card the Thought, as I do being a <HI>Lati|tudinarian,</HI> for the gain of Popularity. I am quite &s;ure,
<PB N="iv" REF="008808_0017_102FEFBC4722F338">
that in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, I am far from being &s;ingular in my Opinion: Many of my Fathers and Brethren, I well know, hold the &s;ame Principle. And all Men of any tolerable Reading in Divinity, know that numerous Divines, in various Ages, mo&s;t renowned for Wi&s;dom and Piety in the Church of GOD, have been of the &s;ame Opinion, I own indeed, that in the Compa&s;s of my &s;mall Reading, I have not, that I remember, &s;een the Point handled by way of methodical Argument, yet ca&s;ual Hints, and plain Declarations, in Authors, give us their Opinions: To quote, would be endle&s;s. If numerous Authorities may add Force, and &s;erve to confront Op|ponents, the Balance is in my Favour.
<Q><L><HI>Vis unitur fortior.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>IN Con&s;equence of the foregoing Principle; in my Ser|mon, I have in&s;i&s;ted upon the &s;trict Examination of Candidates,&mdash;as to their Acquaintance with experimental Religion: For 'tis quite beyond me to comprehend, how to &s;eperate here, with Con&s;i&s;tency. Neverthele&s;s, we find that Men will &s;ometimes make the Conce&s;&s;ion, that Candidates for the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try ought &s;avingly to know the LORD, and yet don't care to admit that they &s;hould pa&s;s an Examination, as to their experimental Religion. Here I would take the Liberty to ob&s;erve: That upon this Conce&s;&s;ion, that the Go&s;pel does require &s;aving Grace, as a nece&s;&s;ary Qualification in a Candidate for the Holy Mini&s;try, then he has not a &s;olid Founda|tion, of Right to engage therein, unle&s;s he is po&s;&s;e&s;t thereof. And of Con&s;equence, Mini&s;ters ought not to &s;eperate him to the Work of the Mini&s;try, without Evidence &s;ufficient to found a Judgment of Chri&s;tian Charity upon, that he is truly gracious: For Faithfulne&s;s to our LORD, does nece&s;&s;arily require, that we have all Rea&s;on to believe that the Candidate to whom we commit the Mini&s;try, is qualified as the Go&s;pel does injoin: And therefore we mu&s;t have all the moral Evidence, and Satisfaction, the Nature of the Ca&s;e will admit, that the Candidate is truly gracious. The Point then &s;eems to turn upon this
<PB N="v" REF="008808_0018_102FEFBDCE4DFCC0">
Hinge, or upon the Solution of this Que&s;tion, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> "How &s;hall we have all the Evidence the Nature of the Ca&s;e will admit, in order to exerci&s;e a Chri&s;tian Judg|ment of Charity, that the Candidate is truly gracious?" Now, for a Per&s;on to appear blamele&s;s, as touching the Law, as St. <HI>Paul</HI> tells us he did before Conver&s;ion, or as &s;trict a Legali&s;t as the the young Man in the Go&s;pel, who yet lacked the main Thing; will this, or in other Words, will an Appearance of outward Holine&s;s of Life, &s;uffi|cient for a King of mere negative Charity, afford all the Evidence for the Exerci&s;e of a Chri&s;tian Judgment of Charity, that a Per&s;on &s;avingly knows the LORD, that the Nature of the Ca&s;e will admit? If it will, nothing farther mu&s;t be &s;ought. But if the Nature of the Ca&s;e will admit, that a Profe&s;&s;ion of the E&s;&s;entials of Chri&s;tian Piety, or an hone&s;t Declaration of experimental Religion, as affording &s;ome Degree of Evidence, for the Exerci&s;e of a Chri&s;tian Judgment of Charity, that a Per&s;on &s;aving|ly knows the LORD; then, in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, &s;uch Pro|fe&s;&s;ion, or experimental Religion, mu&s;t be &s;ought. Now whether experimental Religion has in it, ordinarily, any Thing of the Nature of Evidence; and is of U&s;e, or u&s;e|le&s;s, as to a Judgment of Chri&s;tian Charity towards a Per|&s;on, let all judge who profe&s;s to believe there is &s;uch a Thing as experimental Religion, and that the Bible in|forms us what it is.</P>
<P>THAT I may be the better under&s;tood by my common Reader, I will &s;uppo&s;e, that he and I were Pre&s;ent the other Day, at a Se&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Presbytery,</HI> when the Can|didates <HI>Theodorus</HI> and <HI>Popularus</HI> were examined: We had &s;ome previous Knowledge of them both, &s;o as to have an equal negative Charity.&mdash;They were a&s;ked as to their Aims and Views;&mdash;As to what they had experienced of the Power of Divine Truth, convincing, &s;anctifing and comforting.&mdash;As to a Life of Faith, and Devotedne&s;s to GOD.&mdash;And, 'tis needle&s;s to repeat,&mdash;we remember Que&s;tions and An&s;wers.&mdash;To be &s;hort, &s;o far as we could judge, (and we could not help forming &s;ome Judgment) <HI>Theodorus</HI> gave an Account of his experimental Religion,
<PB N="vi" REF="008808_0019_102FEFC0D27FF640">
and a Life of Holine&s;s, as a Fruit of Faith in CHRIST, well agreeing with the Word of GOD: But <HI>Popularus</HI> could give no &s;uch Scriptural Account of experimental Religion and Holine&s;s, for he had none to give. Now if my Rea|der will acknowledge, that he has more Evidence for a Judgment of Charity, that <HI>Theodorus</HI> is truly gracious, than he has that <HI>Popularus</HI> is &s;o, I have gained the Point I have pur&s;ued.&mdash;'Tis not my De&s;ign at pre&s;ent to an&s;wer Objections; "What &s;aith the Law and the Te&s;|timonies?&mdash;However, as there is one that is Chief, and is thought by &s;ome unan&s;werable, and as bearing all, that can be &s;aid, down before it, it may not be improper here to give it a brief Con&s;ideration, The Objection is this, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> If &s;aving Grace is required in the Go&s;pel, as a nece&s;&s;ary Qualification in a Candidate for the Mini&s;try, the LORD CHRIST would have given &s;ome certain Rule, whereby Mini&s;ters might a&s;&s;uredly know whether they have &s;uch Grace, or not; but no &s;uch Rule is given, therefore the Go&s;pel does not require &s;uch Grace in the Candidate. Now, if there is any Strength in the Objec|tion, it lies in the Truth of his Propo&s;ition, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> That whatever Qualification the Go&s;pel requires in a Candidate, the LORD CHRIST has given &s;ome certain Rule, whereby Mini&s;ters may know whether he has &s;uch a Qualification, or not. If this Propo&s;ition is not true, than there is no Force at all in the Argument. But is there a Divine upon the Face of the Earth, that will a&s;&s;ert and &s;tand to it, that this Propo&s;ition is true? No; not one: For all will own that &s;ome internal Qualifications are required, &s;ome King of Faith and Sincerity, and all mu&s;t own they have no certain Rule whereby they can a&s;&s;uredly know the hid|den Things of the Heart: And this is to di&s;own the Pro|po&s;ition, as to its Truth, and con&s;equently to give up the Objection, or Argument. I &s;uppo&s;e all who make the above-mentioned Objection, again&s;t what I have a&s;&s;erted, are agreed, to a Man, that the Go&s;pel does re|quire in Candidates for the Mini&s;try, what they call moral Sincerity, moral Seriou&s;ne&s;s of Spirit, and &s;oundne&s;s in the Faith, as nece&s;&s;ary Qualifications. I will now &s;uppo&s;e,
<PB N="vii" REF="008808_0020_102FEFC539D50208">
that &s;ome one, lax in Principle, and rude in Speech, be|comes and Objector again&s;t my Objectors, &s;aying, Gentle|men, you hold a Set of rigid Principles indeed: You a&s;&s;ert that the Go&s;pel requires that Candidates for the Holy Mini&s;try, mu&s;t have the&s;e Qualifications, moral Seriou&s;ne&s;s of Spirit, and Soundne&s;s in the Faith: But the LORD CHRIST has given you no certain Rule, by which you can a&s;&s;uredly know that a Candidate has &s;uch Quali|fications; therefore the Go&s;pel does not require them. Now, what will my Objectors do? To profe&s;s they have &s;uch a Rule, they know they cannot; to &s;ay that CHRIST has been unfaithful to his Church they dare not; infalli|bility they have not; to give up their Principle they mu&s;t not, for the Go&s;pel expre&s;ly requires the&s;e Qualifications: What can they, what mu&s;t they do! There is but one Thing that can be done con&s;i&s;tent with common Sen&s;e, and that is to acknowledge, that their grand and beloved Objection, brought again&s;t the Truths I a&s;&s;ert, has no Force at all in it. Should they imagine any, it lies as much again&s;t them, as others: In &s;hort the Argument proves too much, if any Thing, and therefore nothing at all. I am quite &s;en&s;ible that the Things I a&s;&s;ert fall heavy upon tho&s;e Candidates, who are not what they ought to be, and di&s;like to be told what they &s;hould be:&mdash;I expect their Di&s;plea&s;ure, however, they have my Com|pa&s;&s;ion, and my Prayers. They no doubt greatly applaud the Conduct of tho&s;e Mini&s;ters who look upon it needle&s;s to examine Candidates for the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try, as to their experimental Acquaintance with Religion: Yet I take the Liberty to tell &s;uch Candidates, that if ever a Sovereign GOD is plea&s;ed to give them &s;anctifying Grace, and impre&s;&s;es their Hearts with a due Sen&s;e of his glorious Attributes, the Holine&s;s of his Law, the Purity of the Go&s;pel, the Weight of Things Eternal, and the immen&s;e Worth of Souls, they will then be very far from an Approbation of the Practice of &s;uch Mini&s;ters, upon the Point of which I &s;peak; (not to &s;ay of their experimental Religion al&s;o) or I am greatly mi&s;taken.</P>

<P>THE Glorious <HI>Immanuel,</HI> the Me&s;&s;enger of the Covenant, the everla&s;ting Covenant between the Per&s;ons of the holy Trinity, fir&s;t pro|claimed the eternal <HI>Secret</HI> of redeeming Coun|&s;el and Love, unto trembling Man in the Garden: This Revelation the Apo&s;tle remarkably termeth the glorious Go&s;pel.

<P>PREACHERS of the Go&s;pel, entru&s;ted with the Holy Mini&s;try, as a nece&s;&s;ary Qualification, ought to know the Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> not only by objective Light, or the external directive Light of Divine Revelation; but al&s;o by an internal, powerful and &s;aving Illumination of the Mind, by the Irradiation and Operation of the Holy Spirit. And &s;o to become po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of a Knowledge, that is not produced by the Power of human Rea&s;on, or the common Methods of Education or In&s;truction; and therefore a Knowledge not confin'd to the Head, but &s;eated in the Heart. An affectionate and fiducial Know|ledge; di&s;po&s;ing the happy Subject of it to an intire Reliance upon the Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> for Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Grace, and eternal Life; and to love Him &s;uperlatively, as di&s;cerning his incomparable Beauty, Glory, and Ex|cellency. A Knowledge that is Soul-humbling, Self-emptying, Soul-transforming, Chri&s;t-exalting; and pro|ductive of Hatred to all Sin, and of a &s;incere, cheerful, &s;olemn Con&s;ecration of the whole Man to the Service, Honour, and Glory of the Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> This is that Knowledge, which di&s;po&s;ed <HI>St. Paul</HI> to improve all his Abilities to holy Ends and Purpo&s;es; which put him upon &s;ubordinating all his natural and acquired, in|tellectual and moral Accompli&s;hments, unto the Glory of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and the Good of his Church: And according to the Mea&s;ure of it received, will always have an an|&s;werable Effect upon Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel. This is that Knowledge, which the Apo&s;tle in Di&s;tinction from

the Form of Knowledge, calls the Savour of Knowledge;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2. 14.</NOTE> and with Re&s;pect to which, he accounted all Things but Lo&s;s and Damage, as in the View of it's va&s;t Im|portance, and tran&s;cendent Excellence;<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Phil.</HI> 3. 8.</NOTE> and in Com|pari&s;on with which, he determined to know nothing, even in <HI>Corinth</HI> it&s;elf, the Seat of Learning and Polite|ne&s;s<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2. 2.</NOTE>.

<P>THUS the Apo&s;tle had <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> revealed in him, and &s;avingly manife&s;ted to him, before he preach'd Him to others: And this &s;upernatural, experimental, and practical Knowledge of the Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> every Man ought to be po&s;&s;e&s;t of, that enters upon the Evan|gelical Mini&s;try.</P>
<P>FOR, unle&s;s the Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t </HI> is thus revealed in, and &s;avingly manife&s;ted unto a Man, he cannot be qualified for the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try, as the Word of GOD does require; nor in any due Mea&s;ure an&s;wer the Characters and Epithets given to Go&s;pel Mini&s;ters, in the &s;acred Pages. The Word of GOD requires, that Men be Holy who are put into the Holy Mini&s;try;<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tit.</HI> 1. 7.</NOTE> and the Holine&s;s required is not meerly relative, but real, and injoined as a nece&s;&s;ary Qualification for a Go&s;pel Mini&s;ter. The Mini&s;ters of <HI>Chri&s;t'</HI>s Church, have a &s;acred Rule of Direction given them, that will abide tho' Heaven and Earth pa&s;s away; that they put <HI>faithful Men</HI> into the Mini&s;try:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2. 2.</NOTE> And 'tis required of Men in the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try, that they be <HI>faithful;</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 4. 2.</NOTE> and Faithfulne&s;s in this Ca&s;e, includes pure and &s;piritual Aims and Intentions for GOD; and nece&s;|&s;arily implies the &s;aving Knowledge of our Lord <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and the Derivation of Divine Grace from him.

greatly conformed in his Nature to the moral Excellencies of GOD, and in a &s;incere Manner devoted to his Service and Glory: And therefore implies &s;aving Illumination in the Knowledge of our Lord <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> The Holy Spirit gives the Character of Go&s;pel Mini&s;ters, and the Cha|racter of Men in a State of unrenewed Nature, as ex|tremely diver&s;e and exceeding oppo&s;ite, the one to the other. Men in a State of unrenewed Nature, and with|out the &s;aving Knowledge of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> He calls blind, dark, ignorant, ungodly, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> But a&s;cribes to Go&s;pel Mini|&s;ters the Titles and Epithets of Watchmen, Stars, Angels, Men of GOD, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> Now can there po&s;&s;ibly be a greater Soleci&s;m in Nature, a more ab&s;olute Incon&s;i&s;tency in Terms; than to &s;ay, a blind Watchman, a Star of Darkne&s;s, an ignorant Angel, an ungodly Man of GOD? Men, nor Angels, can't render the&s;e di&s;cordant, jarring Terms and Characters corre&s;pondent and harmonious. If without the &s;aving Knowledge of our Lord <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> Men can't be qualified for the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try, as the Word of GOD does expre&s;sly require; nor an&s;wer the Characters the Holy Gho&s;t gives to Go&s;pel Mini&s;ters.&mdash;The Con&s;equence is plain.&mdash;</P>
<P>I proceed, unle&s;s Men &s;avingly know the Lord, they can't covenant with Him, after the Manner He requires, at the Time of &s;olemn Separation to the Work of the Holy Mini&s;try, by Prayer, and the Impo&s;ition of the Hands of the Pre&s;bytery. At this Time, there is a Covenant enter'd into the GOD, call'd the Covenant of <HI>Levi;</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> the Per&s;on ordained vows and &s;wears Allegi|ance to the Lord, that he will be faithful in the Work now devolved upon him, as &s;incerely con&s;ecrated to the Service of GOD. Now, how can a Per&s;on thus declare before GOD, Angels, and Men, that he &s;incerely gives up him&s;elf to GOD, and promi&s;e all good Fidelity; when at the &s;ame Time he keeps back his Heart, and has not the lea&s;t Spark of Grace to enable him to be &s;incere and faithful? Nor does it avail here to &s;ugge&s;t, that altho' he has not gracious, yet he has moral Sincerity; for in this Covenant, GOD calls for the Heart, for Uprightne&s;s
<PB N="6" REF="008808_0027_102FEFD979CD60E8">
of Heart; and will accept of nothing &s;hort thereof. There is not one Word in all the <HI>Bible</HI> that tolerates us, in &s;ub&s;tituting moral Sincerity in the Place of gracious; nor that permits us to play the Hypocrite or Para&s;ite with GOD: The Con&s;equence again is plain.</P>
<P>MOREOVER, if Men who know not the Lord &s;avingly, enter upon the Work of the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try; they can|not perform the Duties of the &s;acred Function after the Manner he requires, nor meet with his Approbation or Acceptance therein. 'Tis often, and truly &s;aid, that not <HI>Nouns;</HI> but <HI>Adverbs</HI> make good Works; that 'tis not meerly doing <HI>Bonum</HI> a good Thing, but doing that good Thing <HI>Bene</HI> well, which is what the Apo&s;tle calls Well-doing. For a Work to be good, as to the Man|ner of Performance, and circum&s;tantially con&s;ider'd; it mu&s;t be done, not only according to the declared Will of GOD; but al&s;o mu&s;t proceed from the noble Evange|lical Principles of Faith and Love, and be perform'd with an ultimate View to the Glory of GOD: But this never can be, 'till a Per&s;on &s;avingly knows the Lord <HI>Chri&s;t;</HI> con&s;equently the Per&s;on de&s;titute of Evangelical Obedience, cannot meet with the Acceptance and Ap|probation of the infinite Maje&s;ty of all Worlds; and if not his Approbation, then of Con&s;equence di&s;approved by Him: A Thought infinitely &s;hocking! The Mini&s;ter who knows not the Lord &s;avingly, will nece&s;&s;arily and unavoidably &s;eek him&s;elf, &s;upremely and ultimately. He &s;ets up him&s;elf in the Room and Place of GOD; and the grand <HI>Idol Self,</HI> is prefered to the GOD of Heaven and Earth, and his Glory. He undertook the Mini&s;try under the Power of &s;elfi&s;h Views; and let him &s;tudy, try to pray, and preach; in all he does, the grand Object <HI>Self</HI> &s;till terminates his Views. He acts the Part of down right Rebellion, again&s;t his infinite SOVEREIGN; and, as it were, di&s;putes the Rights of God-Head with Him. Becomes guilty of a &s;acrilegious Robbing of GOD, and the vile&s;t Idolatry under the Sun; and the Violation of infinite Obligation to his glorious and dread Sovereign. Now, let tho&s;e who impartially read the <HI>ancient Go&s;pel,</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="008808_0028_102FEFDB3938E148">
judge, whether Men thus di&s;approved of GOD, and &s;uch Self-&s;eekers; can be Chri&s;t's duly qualified Mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>I go on to ob&s;erve, That the Nature and Rea&s;on of the Mini&s;terial Office, and Service, requires that Men engaged therein, &s;hould &s;avingly know the Lord. The Laws of God required the Prie&s;ts under the Law to be holy Per&s;ons, in the mo&s;t &s;trong and vehement Expre&s;|&s;ions, founded on the &s;pecial Relation they &s;tood in, to God; and the Nature and Rea&s;on of their Office, ab&s;o|lutely and repeatedly enjoining Holine&s;s upon them.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Lev.</HI> 21, 6, 7, 8,</NOTE> The Obligation is as expre&s;s and &s;trong under the Evan|gelical Di&s;pen&s;ation. Does it not appear rea&s;onable and fit in the Nature of Things, that they who are call'd to &s;erve the holy GOD, in a high and holy Station; to &s;tand before Him, to mini&s;ter in holy Things, for high and holy Purpo&s;es; &s;hould be truly Holy, his hearty Friends and Servants, wi&s;hing well to his Cau&s;e and Intere&s;t in the World? Are not known Enemies in Heart, to the Per&s;on and Intere&s;t of the Prince, unfit Per&s;ons to be entru&s;ted with negotiating the important Affairs of his Kingdom? There is no Man who is not either a true Subject to <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> or his Enemy. That Man who don't truly know <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and &s;ubmit to him as his King and Lord, by bearing true Faith and Allegiance to him; is the Enemy of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and his Kingdom.</P>
<P>DOES it not appear incon&s;i&s;tent in its own Nature, to be&s;eech others to become reconciled to God; and at the &s;ame Time to be irreconciled to God, and an Enemy to the exalted King of <HI>Zion?</HI> A Preacher going forth to evangelize others; and yet a Stranger to real Go&s;pel Holine&s;s, and incapable of performing any one Act of Duty evangelically? A Preacher of that Word which is pure and holy, of that Go&s;pel which is glorious in its Light, Life, and Power; him&s;elf unholy and impure, in Darkne&s;s, legally and &s;piritually dead? As a Mini&s;ter, the Servant of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> by Legation; and yet &s;eek|ing him&s;elf with a &s;upreme Affection? The <HI>Chariot</HI> and Hor&s;eman of <HI>I&s;rael;</HI> yet unable to promote the Pro|tection of God's People, by Zeal and fervent Prayer,
<PB N="8" REF="008808_0029_102FEFDCC5BAD3D0">
un&s;kilful in wielding the Sword of the Spirit, by which the <HI>Devil</HI> is not invulnerable? The Glory of <HI>Chri&s;t;</HI> yet him&s;elf in Darkne&s;s, and under the black Banner of Wrath Divine? The Salt of the Earth; yet un&s;avoury? The Light of the World in&s;trumentally; yet never truly illuminated by transforming Beams of Light from the Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s? I &s;ay, is there not an incon|gruity, and an unfitne&s;s in the&s;e Things, in their own Nature and Relation con&s;idered.</P>
<P>AND does it not appear as having a Sort of Impro|priety in it, that the Mini&s;ter who is the Mouth of the People to GOD in Prayer, leading the Devotion of the A&s;&s;embly, in which, we would charitably hope, there is ordinarily a Number of gracious Souls in a &s;piritual Frame, breathing forth a Spirit of Adoption; and the whole A&s;&s;embly greatly needing Ble&s;&s;ings for both Worlds, Ble&s;&s;ings to be given in An&s;wer to Prayer, "the inwrought Prayer of the righteous Man;" but the Mini&s;ter him&s;elf de&s;titute of a Spirit of true Devo|tion, a&s;&s;i&s;ting Grace, and real Adoption?</P>
<P>HOW many, and how various, are the Temptations, De&s;ertions, Trials, &s;piritual Conflicts, and Exerci&s;es of the People of GOD, in this twilight-State of the Imper|fection of Grace, and probation-Sea&s;on for Eternity? And how much in &s;uch Ca&s;es they need a &s;piritual &s;kilful Guide? Unexperienced Mini&s;ters will be mi&s;erable poor <HI>Ca&s;ui&s;ts,</HI> in &s;uch Ca&s;es. And al&s;o with Re&s;pect to Sin|ners; if by &s;ome Means, any are awaken'd, and &s;olicitous to know how they mu&s;t be &s;aved; now, now, for a Me&s;&s;enger of the Lord, one of a Thou&s;and, to &s;peak a Word in Sea&s;on. But the Mini&s;ter that knows not the Lord &s;avingly; in preaching, and in conver&s;e with &s;uch poor di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Souls; will mo&s;t likely place Duties, in the Room of <HI>Chri&s;t;</HI> and after all the Help he can ob|tain by Books and Reading, he will be a blind Leader of the Blind; and the Con&s;equence of &s;uch Conduct, our Lord has told us.</P>
<P>IF we ca&s;t an Eye upon the final Hour of Life, and behold the Sick and Dying, among a People profe&s;&s;ing

the Chri&s;tian Religion; we &s;hall &s;ee them, ordinarily now, very de&s;irous of the Pre&s;ence and Prayers of a Mini&s;ter: (peradventure in &s;ome In&s;tances before &s;lighted) The very Verge of Time is now come, the eternal Judgment is at the Door, unmea&s;urable Eternity opens with a growing View; the Exchange of Worlds appears an Affair of great, of &s;olemn, of infinite Weight; the Angel's dread Trumpet &s;ounds, "Time &s;hall be no more;" the immortal Spirit mu&s;t enter upon the unut|terable interminable Joys of Heaven, or be plunged into the intolerable eternal Torments of Hell In this final Hour, &s;ome few, a &s;pecial, little, happy Number; are highly favour'd of the Lord, with copious Mea&s;ures of divine Light; with the Triumphs of Faith, with the joyous pro&s;pect of the &s;ub&s;tantial, untarni&s;h'd Glories of the Sanctuary of Immortality: Altho' the&s;e do not &s;tand in &s;o much Need, yet they rejoice, greatly rejoice, in the Pre&s;ence, Conver&s;e, Prayers, and Prai&s;es "of the Man of GOD." Others who hopefully "have the Root of the Matter in them," have the Evidences of their gracious Sincerity much clouded over.&mdash;Some are terribly harra&s;&s;ed with Templations&mdash;Others are under the Power of Self-Flattery, and a vain Confidence; and need to have their Foundations &s;haken.&mdash;Some are awfully &s;ecure, and need an alarming Word.&mdash;Others are full of Anxiety, as perceiving them&s;elves tottering, not only upon the Verge of Life, but on the very Brink of Hell: Alas for them!

Now, altho' all real Sanctification, and Preparation for eternal Glory, depends upon the holy Spirit's Agency; yet as Means are the Appointment of Heaven, without an undue

Dependence upon them; the Pre&s;ence, &s;piritual Conver|&s;ation, Coun&s;el, and Prayers of "the Man of God," at &s;uch Times, and in &s;uch Ca&s;es, mu&s;t &s;urely be of no &s;mall Importance, and ought to be much de&s;ired and prized. And O! how &s;ad the Calamity, when the Mini&s;ter is unfit to deal with Per&s;ons <HI>under&s;tandingly</HI> in Soul-Ca&s;es, e&s;pecially at &s;uch a Time; as whatever Attempt he may make, is not able to offer up one Peti|tion to GOD, in a right Manner for them; having no &s;pecial Intere&s;t in the Redeemer, nor Acce&s;s to the Throne of Grace. In &s;hort, the more clo&s;ely we view the Nature and Rea&s;on of Mini&s;terial Office and Service, and the various Duties of the &s;acred Function; the more evident it will appear, that Men who enter upon the holy Mini&s;try, ought to be Men who have a &s;aving Knowledge of the Lord; and an experimental Acquain|tance, with the Power and purifying Influence of divine Truth upon their Hearts.</P>
<P>LASTLY <HI>here,</HI> tho&s;e, and only tho&s;e, who &s;avingly know the Lord <HI>Chri&s;t;</HI> have Warrant to expect his gra|cious &s;piritual Pre&s;ence with them in their Work. As Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> we can neither look for A&s;&s;i&s;tance in our Work, nor Succe&s;s unto it; but from the promi&s;ed Pre&s;ence, and &s;pecial Influence of the holy Spirit alone. The Go&s;pel is call'd "the Mini&s;try of the Spirit,"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3, 8.</NOTE> as it is that Mini&s;try which the Spirit makes effectual unto all the Ends of it; or becau&s;e 'tis that <HI>Mini&s;try</HI> whereby the Spirit, in his Gifts and Graces is communicated unto Men. The Kingdom of our Lord <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is &s;piritual, and the animating Principles of it invi&s;ible. If we fix our Minds only on outward Order, we lo&s;e the Ri&s;e and Power of the whole; 'tis not an outward "vi&s;ible Ordination by Men," tho' that is nece&s;&s;ary by Rule and Precept, but <HI>Chri&s;t'</HI>s Communi|cation of the Spirit according to Promi&s;e; that gives Being, Life, U&s;efulne&s;s, and Succe&s;s to the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try.

Pre&s;ence with them, and his Ble&s;&s;ing upon their Labours: To them He hath &s;aid,&mdash;"And lo, I am with you to the Con&s;ummation of all Things." Lo, I am with you, to qualify, protect, a&s;&s;i&s;t, and &s;ucceed you, by the Aids and Influences of the Holy Spirit. 'Tis a Point of Truth that may be evidenc'd, as Mr. <HI>Fleming</HI> ob&s;erves, That now under the <Q>New Te&s;tament, there are Mini&s;ters of the Spirit, and not of the dead Letter and empty Sound. That with the Word there goes a Mini&s;tration and Life. It is very di&s;cernable, what a great Difference, and another Appearance, there is both on Mini&s;ters and Chri&s;tians at one Time, from what they are at <HI>another,</HI> in the Di&s;charge of Duty, as if the&s;e were not the &s;ame Per&s;ons; which ap|peareth not only in the Enlargement, and &s;traitning of their Gifts, but al&s;o in Power and Life. Is it not &s;een, with what Liberty the&s;e do &s;ometimes <HI>pray,</HI> and are as a Ship with a full Gale before the Wind? That 'tis then ea&s;y to preach.</Q>&mdash;When Mini&s;ters have the Grace of GOD in them, and the &s;pecial Pre&s;ence of the Spirit of GOD with them, they are wont to preach &s;o as they could not if left to them&s;elves, de&s;titute of Divine Influence and A&s;&s;i&s;tance. We pretend not thereby to immediate Revelations and In&s;pirations of new Truths, no; there is an exact Agreement between the Works of the Spirit, and the Word of GOD; and therefore all Impul&s;es, Revelations, or pretended Ope|rations of the Spirit, which are contrary to, or have no Foundation in the Scriptures; are to be rejected as en|thu&s;ia&s;tic Fancies, or &s;atanical Delu&s;ions. But we &s;up|po&s;e, that the holy Spirit "takes of the Things of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and &s;hews them unto us;" illuminates our Minds, and helps us to di&s;cern the moral Beauty and Amiable|ne&s;s of Things Divine; draws forth our Graces into lively Exerci&s;e while we are preaching; increa&s;es our Views of the infinite Importance, as well as &s;urpa&s;&s;ing Excellence of Divine Truth; and thereby enlarges our Hearts, and helps us to &s;peak with Power and Freedom, concerning the Things of GOD. And I &s;ee not why,
<PB N="12" REF="008808_0033_102FEFE6E81BF1C0">
we may not freely own, that the holy Spirit frequently helps us, in the Time of preaching, to &s;ea&s;onable Thoughts, which upon a quick and due Scanning, we perceive to be important Truth, and pertinent to pre|&s;ent Purpo&s;e; and hereby we enlarge upon &s;ome Branch of our Di&s;cour&s;e, and urge &s;ome Points home upon the Con&s;ciences of our Hearers, beyond what we thought of in the Time of Compo&s;ition; and &s;o as to exceed what we have done at &s;ome other Times, when under the be&s;t Advantages by preparatory Thought. But this is not the Point I mean to pur&s;ue at pre&s;ent. That which we in&s;i&s;t upon to our pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e, is, That the a&s;&s;i&s;ting Influence of the holy Spirit in preaching the Go&s;pel, is a Ble&s;&s;ing of great Importance; and that or|dinarily the Lord works by, and improves tho&s;e Men, as In&s;truments for the Conver&s;ion of Sinners, and the progre&s;&s;ive Sanctification and Con&s;olation of his People; whom He hath qualified and fitted for his Service, by confering upon them, both the Gifts and Graces of his Spirit: And thereupon granting them pre&s;ent divine Influences, and crowning their Labours with his effica|cious Ble&s;&s;ing. Of this we are firmly a&s;&s;ured, from the Word of GOD; and as acce&s;&s;ory Evidence, from Church <HI>Hi&s;tory;</HI> and &s;ome Degree of Ob&s;ervation. At the &s;ame Time, we do not imagine, that the Efficacy of the Word di&s;pen&s;ed, depends upon the Worthine&s;s and Holine&s;s, or Good-will and Intention of him that &s;peaks, no; the Lord is an infinite Sovereign, He hath not limited him&s;elf, tho' He hath us: He may ble&s;s Truth by whom&s;oever &s;poken; and &s;ometimes di&s;plays his ab|&s;olute Sovereignty in this Re&s;pect. Neverthele&s;s, we in&s;i&s;t upon it, as a Point never to be given up; that Mini&s;ters eminently need the Spirit of the Lord with them, and in them; in order to preach, and to perform Mini&s;terial Duties, as they ought, and in a due Manner. By the Aids and Influences of the holy Spirit granted to Go&s;pel Mini&s;ters, they are endued with Zeal for God's Glory, the Honour of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and the Sal|vation of Souls; and are di&s;po&s;ed to &s;tudy and preach
<PB N="13" REF="008808_0034_102FEFE871679158">
&s;uch Things as do e&s;pecially tend to promote tho&s;e im|portant Purpo&s;es; thereby they are prepared to declare the Word of GOD powerfully and faithfully; are &s;aved from the en&s;naring Fear of Man, and the &s;uperficial downy Touch of Con&s;cience; now they become <HI>Boa|nerges,</HI> proclaiming the Terrors of <HI>Horeb'</HI>s <HI>fiery Law,</HI> in the &s;hocking Accents of <HI>Sina'</HI>s dreadful Thunder; they lift up the Voice like a <HI>Trumpet,</HI> and will not &s;pare to declare important Truth, whether People will hear or forbear; and <HI>Barnabas</HI> like, they &s;ound the jubilee Trumpet of the Go&s;pel; proclaiming Liberty to the Captives, and offering the Oil of Joy to the broken-hearted and di&s;con&s;olate Chri&s;tian; and hereby they be|come wi&s;e to win Souls to <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and to conduct them on their Way to eternal Glory. Now, when the Lord is thus pre&s;ent with his Mini&s;ters, and affords them &s;pe|cial A&s;&s;i&s;tance; He ordinarily a&s;&s;ociates the Influences of his Spirit with the Word preached, and makes it powerful to Salvation. But the Preacher that knows not the Lord &s;avingly, can lay no claim to his gracious Pre&s;ence, by any Word of Promi&s;e; nor has he any ju&s;t Ground to expect a Ble&s;&s;ing upon his Labours. The true State of the Ca&s;e is, the In&s;titution of the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try is eminently the Work of the Holy Gho&s;t; (I mean not exclu&s;ive of the Father and the Son, the Works of the Trinity, towards the Creatures, being un|divided) 'tis his Work to confer on Men Gifts and Graces, as nece&s;&s;ary Furniture for, and to put them into the Mini&s;try,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Acts</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> and to a&s;&s;i&s;t and &s;ucceed them therein; making them able Mini&s;ters of the New-Te&s;tament, and thereupon crowning their Labours with glorious Succe&s;s. Therefore, the Man that has not an experimental Know|ledge of the &s;anctifying Operations of the holy Spirit in and upon his Heart; cannot hone&s;tly, and with a well informed <HI>Con&s;cience,</HI> engage in the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try: If he does, he enters upon this arduous and difficult Work alone; and alas for him, abides in it alone! As he goes on therein without a &s;aving Knowledge of the Lord, he
<PB N="14" REF="008808_0035_102FEFEDEE9B3E70">
can't prove him&s;elf call'd of GOD to preach the Go&s;pel, nor can he in Faith pray for a Ble&s;&s;ing upon his Labours, having no Word of Promi&s;e for that Purpo&s;e, nor any ju&s;t Ground to expect the Lord's Ble&s;&s;ing.&mdash;And what|ever &s;hining Appearance he may make in his own Eye, and in the Judgment of <HI>&s;ome;</HI> there is great Deficiency in all his Performances, a main Excellency is wanting. We mu&s;t hence conclude, that if the gracious Pre&s;ence of GOD, the a&s;&s;i&s;ting Influence of his Spirit, and his Ble&s;&s;ing are important and excellent; that &s;uch Men, and only &s;uch, ought to engage in the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try, who &s;avingly know the Lord: And &s;urely we mu&s;t believe, that the Divine Influences to &s;anctify, a&s;&s;i&s;t, and ble&s;s; are of the la&s;t Importance, and highe&s;t Excellence. The whole Succe&s;s of the Mini&s;try in propagating the Go&s;pel in the World, and building up the Church; depends in|tirely upon the Mi&s;&s;ion, Pre&s;ence, A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and In|fluence of the Holy Spirit. Upon the whole then, if the Preacher who knows not the Lord &s;avingly, is thus left <HI>alone,</HI> without his A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Ble&s;&s;ing;&mdash;if the Nature and Rea&s;on of Mini&s;terial Office and Service, require that Men who enter upon the holy Mini&s;try, &s;hould truly know the Lord;&mdash;if they cannot &s;erve GOD aright, nor meet with his Approbation in their Work, unle&s;s they thus know Him;&mdash;if without &s;uch Knowledge of Him, they cannot tran&s;act a Covenant with Him, as He requires; if they cannot an&s;wer the Title and Cha|racters of a Go&s;pel-Mini&s;ter, nor be qualified for the Work of the holy Mini&s;try, as the Go&s;pel does expre&s;sly require;&mdash;we conclude thus, that Men who enter upon the holy Mini&s;try, ought to be Men who have had the Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> revealed in, and &s;avingly manife&s;ted to them.</P>

thus much in our Text. Altho' we find that Prophe|&s;ies and Promi&s;es, re&s;pecting this grand and marvellous Event, lie thick in the <HI>Old-Te&s;tament;</HI> yet in former Ages it was not &s;o clearly made known to the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Nation: The Time when, the Manner how, and Means by which, were not well under&s;tood, 'till now revealed by the Holy Gho&s;t. When GOD gave his Word to <HI>Jacob,</HI> and his Statutes to <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> "He dealt not &s;o with any other Nation;" other Nations were left to walk after their own Ways, but to them Him&s;elf came down, Angels attending Him, Clouds and Darkne&s;s covering the Place, Voices and Flames diffu&s;ing the Law and Authority of infinite Maje&s;ty. All along from that very Time, when GOD revealed that Promi&s;e, which was blooming Go&s;pel; that "the Seed of the Woman &s;hould break the Serpent's Head," 'till He came, who was the De&s;ire of all Nations; He was narrowing the Intere&s;t of Religion, by every new Di&s;pen&s;ation of the Covenant, 'till the Go&s;pel came to be preached in the la&s;t and be&s;t Edition. Every new Di&s;pen&s;ation, though it made the Covenant brighter, yet it made the Appli|cation of it &s;traiter. The Empire of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> for many Ages, for Thou&s;ands of Years, appear'd only in a nar|row Compa&s;s, as if He loved not a Diffu&s;ion, but a Confinement of his Kingdom and Glory; 'till by his <HI>Cro&s;s</HI> he broke down the Wall of Partition between <HI>Jew</HI> and <HI>Gentile,</HI> and broke up the Enclo&s;ures of his own making; and as Almighty Lord and Conqueror, aro&s;e from the State of the Dead, and thereupon gave Com|mi&s;&s;ion, and Orders to his Di&s;ciples, his flaming Mini|&s;ters, on this wi&s;e, Go, &s;aith He, and di&s;ciple all Nati|ons, preach the Go&s;pel to every Creature. From this Period of divine Mercy and eternal Wonder, according to ancient Prophecies, BEHOLD! "The Wilderne&s;s and the &s;olitary Place are glad, the De&s;ert rejoices and blo&s;|&s;oms as the Ro&s;e! The Gentiles &s;ee the Glory of the Lord, and the Excellency of the God of <HI>I&s;rael!</HI>" But why was GOD &s;o long &s;ilent to the Gentiles? And why did He &s;peak out at la&s;t? Whence was it, that the
<PB N="16" REF="008808_0037_102FEFF25040C440">
Love He u&s;ed to keep within Bounds, now &s;hone out at large, and became the Glory of the Univer&s;e? Even &s;o it &s;eem'd good in his Sight! The <HI>Jews</HI> train'd up for &s;o many Ages, and by all Kind or Preparations for a Redeemer, reject him; and the Gentiles who were no Way prepared, receive him; He who was the De&s;ire of all Nations, becomes the Contempt of his own.&mdash;Without any preparatory Dawn, the Light of the glo|rious Go&s;pel is darted among the Gentiles, like a &s;udden Ru&s;h of Light in a cloudy and dark Day. And among tho&s;e who have the Province of preaching <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> to the Heathen, a&s;&s;ign'd them, behold <HI>Paul!</HI> Who was <HI>Saul</HI> the Per&s;ecutor, apprehended by Grace Divine, when on the Brink of Hell, be-miracled with &s;overeign Mercy; <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is revealed in him, and he commences a Preacher of him to the Gentiles! In the View of the&s;e, and &s;uch like Things, no Marvel that <HI>St. Paul</HI> &s;o often, and with &s;o much &s;eraphic Prai&s;e, &s;peaks of the Preaching of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> to the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> as a my&s;terious Di&s;pen&s;ation of GOD: For verily it expre&s;&s;es his Wi&s;dom, his Sove|reignty, and univer&s;al Goodne&s;s; its full of his Glory, it bears his Image, its wondrous in our Eyes; 'tis rather to be admir'd than explain'd, we can neither leave the Subject with Indifference, nor comprehend it with Knowledge.</P>
<P>IN Pur&s;uance of the Method propo&s;ed, I would briefly ob&s;erve, that to preach <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> to the Gentiles, intends, that we make him the grand Subject of our preaching: That we declare him to be the only Media|tor between GOD and Man; and as Mediator, inve&s;ted with a prophetical, prie&s;tly, and kingly Office; and thoroughly furni&s;h'd for his Work of Mediation, as wanting nothing to render him &s;ucce&s;sful therein; that we repre&s;ent him as &s;ufficient to an&s;wer all the Danger our Souls are in, and all the Nece&s;&s;ities they labour un|der, both by Way of Atonement for them, and of Conque&s;t over them; that we proclaim his infinite Willingne&s;s, as well as Almighty Power to &s;ave; that we a&s;&s;ert his Authority over the whole Creation, and
<PB N="17" REF="008808_0038_102FEFF4E5AEF518">
e&s;pecially over the Churches. That we declare, that He of whom we a&s;&s;ert the&s;e Things, is by Nature GOD; e&s;&s;ential and eternal God, po&s;&s;e&s;t of all infinite Per|fections; and that as God-Man Mediator, having by his Obedience and Death purcha&s;ed Wi&s;dom, Righteou&s;|ne&s;s, Sanctification and Redemption; He mu&s;t certainly be a mo&s;t perfect and complete Redeemer. Thus the Go&s;pel exhibits Chri&s;t to our View, in his per&s;onal Glo|ries and mediatorial Fulne&s;s, and thus He is to be the main Subject of our preaching.</P>
<P>To preach Chri&s;t, is to preach the Go&s;pel, and to preach the Go&s;pel, is to preach tho&s;e Things declar'd in the Go&s;pel; there are tho&s;e Things which are proper and peculiar to the Go&s;pel, and are its own, and are no where el&s;e to be found. Of this Nature are all Things concerning the Love and Will of God in Je&s;us Chri&s;t; the Harmony and Glory of the divine Attributes, as mo&s;t con&s;picuous in the Per&s;on and Mediation of Chri&s;t; his Natures, Offices, and whole Mediation; of the Di&s;pen|&s;ation of the Spirit, and our Participation thereof, and Union with Chri&s;t thereby; our Adoption, Ju&s;tification, and effectual Sanctification thence proceeding. In brief, every Thing that appertains to the Purcha&s;e of Redemp|tion, and the effectual Application thereof as by the Holy Spirit. The&s;e Things are purely and properly evangelical, peculiar to the Go&s;pel alone. I add al&s;o, to preach the Go&s;pel, is to preach the Precepts and moral Duties, with their Sanctions therein declared and en|joined, with an evangelical and proper Reference to <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> The Go&s;pel fir&s;t propo&s;es and declares the Things which are properly its own, lays them as the Foundation of Faith and Obedience, and inlays them in the Mind, thereby conforms the whole Soul unto them; this Foundation being laid, it then grafts all Duties of moral Obedience on this Stock of Faith in <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us;</HI> directs unto a right Performance of them, from a right Principle, by a right Rule, and to a right End and Purpo&s;e; and by a Communication of the Spirit, if &s;upplies with Strength for their Performance,
<PB N="18" REF="008808_0039_102FEFF739E146A8">
in the Manner it pre&s;cribes; and &s;o to their Acceptance with GOD: Hereby the Go&s;pel gives them a new Na|ture, and turns <HI>moral Duties</HI> into <HI>evangelical Obedience.</HI> And this is <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Morality; a Morality &s;pringing from Faith in <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and animated by Go&s;pel-Principles and Incentives, governed by Go&s;pel Rules, and directed to Go&s;pel-Ends. The&s;e Things are the appropriate Glory of the Go&s;pel: And for a <HI>Mi&s;&s;ionary</HI> among the Heathen, thus to preach them, is for him to preach <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> to them. The Ca&s;e is ju&s;t the &s;ame, with Re&s;pect to <HI>us,</HI> who preach to tho&s;e that are apt to call them&s;elves <HI>go&s;pellized;</HI> to them we mu&s;t thus preach the Go&s;pel. We have no ju&s;t Warrant to look for the Pre&s;ence of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> with our Sermons, if <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> be not thus in our Sermons: "The Things that concern the Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI>" the Principles of his Religion, mu&s;t live upon our Lips, mu&s;t reign in our Sermons, or it can't be truly &s;aid, that we preach Chri&s;t; without which, we can't hope for a divine Ble&s;&s;ing to attend our preaching. This is the Way to pre&s;erve the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Religion in its full and evident Di&s;tinction, from every fal&s;e Religion; this is the Way to make Chri&s;t crucified appear "the Wi&s;dom and the Power of GOD;" this is the Way to keep Profe&s;&s;ors &s;ound in the Faith, and to make them obedient to the Faith; and this is the Way to advance the Kingdom of GOD, and to promote the true Knowledge of GOD, and of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> which is Life Eternal.</P>
<P>BY the Way, the&s;e Things pre&s;ent to our View, the main Difference between legal and evangelical Preaching. Men who have no true Knowledge of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and his Go&s;pel, in its Spirituallity; yet have &s;ome Notion about <HI>moral Duties,</HI> which have their Foundation in the Law and Light of Nature. The&s;e moral Duties taught in the Go&s;pel, the legal Preacher pretends to embrace, as e&s;teeming them full as good, or rather better, than <HI>Seneca'</HI>s Morals; and having his Mind principally fix'd upon them, he makes them the reigning Topicks of his Di&s;cour&s;e. He profe&s;&s;es indeed to admit the Go&s;pel
<PB N="19" REF="008808_0040_102FEFFA52A404B8">
Scheme of Doctrines, and re&s;olves to appear a warm Advocate for it's enjoin'd Duties; he thereupon cries up moral Duties, but alas, not in their proper Place, nor to their proper End! The&s;e he makes the Foundation, according to the Place they held in the Law of Nature, and the Covenant of Works; whereas the Go&s;pel allows them to be only nece&s;&s;ary Super&s;tructions on the <HI>Foun|dation.</HI> And by advancing Morality above the <HI>My&s;tery,</HI> and Grace of the Go&s;pel, thereby the Go&s;pel is rejected; and &s;trictly &s;peaking, Morality is de&s;troyed al&s;o; for take it from its proper Foundation, and it falls of Con|&s;equence. Such a Preacher, will &s;ometimes have a cold and ca&s;ual Hint relating to the Merits and Grace of <HI>Chri&s;t;</HI> but is evidently &s;o defective therein, that he can|not ju&s;tly e&s;cape the Compellation <HI>Arminian,</HI> or legal Preacher; tho' he may for the pre&s;ent, the more odious Epithet, <HI>Infidel.</HI> The evangelical Preacher dwells much upon tho&s;e very glorious Topicks, which are Matters of pure Revelation: He is indeed fully a&s;&s;ured, that the Scripture Doctrine of Salvation, by free and &s;overeign Grace, is a Doctrine according to Godline&s;s; he urges, he warmly urges, the Performance of all Duties enjoin'd in the Go&s;pel, and this in their proper Place, and to their proper End; always taking Care to have a beautiful Intertexture of References to <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> And thus to make <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> the Sum and Sub&s;tance, or &s;ubject Matter of our preaching, either directly or reductively, is that which is intended by preaching of Him to <HI>Jew</HI> or <HI>Gentile.</HI></P>
<P>I might al&s;o ob&s;erve, that to preach <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> to the <HI>Gen|tiles,</HI> intends that we make Him the End and De&s;ign of our preaching: That herein, we do not principally pro|po&s;e our own Honour and temporal Intere&s;t, but that we have in View the Honour and Glory of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> as our ultimate End; "Preaching not our&s;elves, but <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us</HI> the Lord."&mdash;But the Time would fail to enlarge here.</P>

<P>IT may help to lucidate and clear up a Call to engage in a <HI>Mi&s;&s;ion,</HI>&mdash;if tho&s;e who&s;e Work and Bu&s;ine&s;s it more e&s;pecially is&punc; to promote an Affair of this Kind, and who are proper Judges of meet Qualifications for a Work of this Nature, unitedly and warmly apply to a Man to engage therein;&mdash;If a more effectual Door &s;eems to open hereby for a Man's promoting the Redeemer's Kingdom, than he is under Advantage for, by his pre&s;ent Situation;

If a Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel is guilty of moral Scandal, or un&s;ound in Point of Doctrine; or but more rarely preaches upon the more important Doctrines of the Go&s;pel, and when he does, gives them but a &s;uperficial Handling; or is &s;ome how notoriou&s;ly deficient in his Work&punc; in &s;uch Ca&s;es, I will not deny, but People have Liberty to &s;eek a Redre&s;s of Grievance, according to the Method the Go&s;pel pre&s;cribes.&mdash;Nor will you &s;up|po&s;e, that I mean to in&s;inuate, that the Want of the &s;aving Knowledge of the Lord in a Mini&s;ter, ab&s;olutely invalidates his Admini&s;trations, and renders then un|lawful, and <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI> void; no, a Man being con&s;ti|tuted a Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel, according to the known and &s;tanding Laws of Chri&s;t's vi&s;ible Kingdom, found in his Word, and thus inve&s;ted with Office Power,

according to Go&s;pel Order; he has lawful Right and Authority to perform all Parts of the Mini&s;terial Work. But then, may I not here apply that Maxim, in u&s;e both by <HI>Civilians</HI> and <HI>Divines?</HI> "Quod factum fieri non debet, factum valet;" at lea&s;t &s;o far avails, that there is Validity in Ordinances admini&s;ter'd by &s;uch a Man; tho' it might have been well, if &s;uch a Man had not been permitted to enter into the holy Mini&s;try; for an unconverted Mini&s;try is one of the greate&s;t Calamities.</P>
<P>HAVING thus pre&s;umed upon your Candour and Judgment, I am apt to imagine you have gone before me, in drawing this native Inference, from what has now been &s;aid, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> That it greatly concerns us, to u&s;e utmo&s;t Care and Caution in putting Men into the Mini|&s;try, le&s;t we commit the holy Mini&s;try to &s;uch Men as known not the Lord &s;avingly. Our ble&s;&s;ed Lord and Ma&s;ter has charged us, not only to "lay Hands &s;ud|denly on no Man," but al&s;o "to commit the Mini&s;try to faithful Men." I am well a&s;&s;ured, that we are una|nimous in this Opinion, that Men ought &s;avingly to know the Lord, who engage in the holy Mini&s;try. We take the Liberty to think for our&s;elves, as well as others, who are not of the &s;ame Opinion: And 'tis at once con|ceded, that we have all the &s;ame Liberty of thinking for our&s;elves, yet no Man has Liberty to think contrary to Truth, be that what it will. As for tho&s;e who de|clare there is no &s;uch Thing as forming any Judgment about Men, whether they are truly gracious, or not; and think it needle&s;s to make any Inquiry after a Can|didate's Acquaintance with experimental Religion; as &s;uppo&s;ing, that if he has a compotent Mea&s;ure of <HI>Lite|rature,</HI> and is not gro&s;sly ignorant, or &s;candalou&s;ly pro|fane, he is fit to be put into the &s;acred Mini&s;try; upon their Principles, whole Clu&s;ters, of light, airy, gracele&s;s young Men; who are far from a &s;avoury Reli&s;h of the Things of GOD, and a &s;erious, &s;olemn Sen&s;e of Things Eternal; may be introduced into the holy Mini&s;try: Is not this to throw down the &s;acred Enclo&s;ure our Lord hath &s;et about his Vineyard, and to Act the Part of
<PB N="24" REF="008808_0045_102FF006F4FCCDD8">
Oppo&s;ition, to that &s;olemn Prohibition, "Lay Hands &s;uddenly on no Man?" Some there are who in Terms profe&s;s, that Candidates for the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try, ought to be godly or gracious Per&s;ons; and yet, when they explain their Profe&s;&s;ion, we find it does not amount to holding, that a Candidate ought to be gracious, or a real Convert, in order to give him Right to undertake the Work of the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try. Their Meaning &s;eems to be this, that they ought to be truly gracious; for &s;o ought all that hear, as well as all that preach the Go&s;pel; adding thus much, that renewing and &s;anctify|ing Grace, is a very u&s;eful Qualification in the Candi|date; but then tis not their Opinion, that it mu&s;t be in&s;i&s;ted upon as &s;uch a nece&s;&s;ary Qualification, as that the Want of it &s;hall be preventive of engaging in the holy Mini&s;try. They plead Nece&s;&s;ity, in Ju&s;tification of Principle; that there are a great many vacant Churches and Congregations, and perhaps more in Number, than there are truly godly young Men to afford a Supply; that that which is wanting can't be number'd, that they mu&s;t take up with &s;uch as they can get.&mdash;I would at pre&s;ent only ob&s;erve here, that what&s;oever the Circum|&s;tances of Chri&s;t's Church are, Men whom we &s;et apart to the Work of the holy Mini&s;try, &s;hould be &s;uch as his Go&s;pel does require them to be. The Que&s;tion in Debate, in plain Terms, is this, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> Does the Word of GOD &s;o require &s;anctifying Grace, in a Candidate for the holy Mini&s;try, as that being de&s;titute thereof, he has not a &s;olid Right of Foundation to engage therein? Now, if a Per&s;on who has not &s;anctifying Grace, or a &s;aving Knowledge of the Lord, cannot lawfully under|take the Work of the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try, as I have en|deavour'd to prove from the Word of GOD, and the Rea&s;on of Things; then Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel ought not to &s;eperate a Per&s;on to the Work of the holy Mini|&s;try, without having Evidence &s;ufficient to found a Judgment of Chri&s;tian Charity upon, that a Per&s;on does thus know the Lord: For Faithfulne&s;s to our Lord and Ma&s;ter, will not &s;uffer us to commit the holy Mini&s;try
<PB N="25" REF="008808_0046_102FF009951A67A0">
to a Per&s;on that we do not judge qualified therefor, as his Go&s;pel does require: Therefore, in putting Men into the Mini&s;try, we mu&s;t &s;eek all the Evidence that the Nature of the Ca&s;e will rea&s;onably admit, that Men &s;avingly know the Lord, and cautiou&s;ly avoid taking up with any Thing &s;hort of this.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Reverend and Dear Sirs,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU will allow me to &s;peak out our Opinion freely. In them whom we introduce into the Mini&s;try, we look for and expect to find, a Competency of natural Endow|ments, acquir'd Improvements, Orthodoxy, or Sound|ne&s;s in the Faith, vi&s;ible Holine&s;s of Life, as 'tis com|monly call'd, and that they give us &s;ome Account of their Acquaintance with experimental Religion, &s;uch as &s;hall appear to us &s;ufficient for the Exerci&s;e of a rational Judgment of Chri&s;tian Charity, that they &s;avingly know the Lord. We pretend not to immediate Revelation from Heaven, and Infallibility of Knowledge in this Ca&s;e, no; but we &s;eek &s;uch Evidence, as the Nature of the Ca&s;e will admit, and as Faithfulne&s;s does require. We are to form a Judgment of the &s;piritual State of our Fellow-Men, in the Ca&s;e before us, by what they pro|fe&s;s with the Mouth, and the Influence &s;uch a Profe&s;&s;ion has upon the Life. Men without an Intention to de|ceive, may impo&s;e upon them&s;elves, and upon us; yet this is no Argument again&s;t an Examination as to the&s;e Things; yea, tis an Argument that we &s;hould be the more &s;trict upon the Point of Examination. If we con&s;ider Faith as appearing in the Profe&s;&s;ion of it, we find the Apo&s;tle accounting the Influences of the holy Spirit, nece&s;&s;ary to enable a Man to make &s;uch a Pro|fe&s;&s;ion of the Faith, as was to be admitted by Chri&s;tians: "No Man can &s;ay that <HI>Je&s;us</HI> is Lord, but by the Holy Gho&s;t." A Man may &s;o explain him&s;elf about his Faith, and give &s;uch an Account of his experimental Religion, and his Faith may have &s;uch Influence upon his Conduct in Life, as to leave no rea&s;onable Ground to &s;u&s;pect but that he &s;avingly knows the Lord. For
<PB N="26" REF="008808_0047_102FF00E6D850BB0">
a Man to appear free from tho&s;e Sins, commonly called openly &s;candalous, and to have a Life &s;o harmle&s;s as to afford a Kind of meer negative Charity, is not enough in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e: We therefore &s;eek a Profe&s;&s;ion of Faith, expre&s;&s;ive of the E&s;&s;entials of real Piety, or that the Candidate give a rational, &s;criptural, and &s;atisfying Account of a &s;anctifying Work of God's Spirit upon his own Heart; and that his Belief, and Experience of the Power of Divine Truth, influences him to live the Truth, &s;o that his Light &s;hines before Men: The&s;e Things are included in the Nature of Evidence, in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, and therefore Mini&s;ters have full Authority, and ju&s;t Right to demand them, and are bound in Faith|fulne&s;s &s;o to do; and of Con&s;equence the Candidate is obliged to exhibit &s;uch Evidence, if 'tis in his Power hone&s;tly &s;o to do. Until we have &s;ought and found &s;uch Evidence, as now mentioned, we have not &s;atisfying Evidence that a Man is qualified for the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try, nor dare we &s;eperate him thereto. Let us then hear what the Candidate has to &s;ay for him&s;elf, as clearing up his Call to enter upon the Work of the Holy Mini&s;try? What his Views and Aims are? What his Faith, and experimental Acquaintance with Divine Truth, or Reli|gion: With Tenderne&s;s and Candour, we would gladly hear him upon the&s;e Points; and &s;eek Satisfaction, as to the Influence of his Faith upon his Conduct in Life.</P>
<P>'TIS verily to be fear'd, that many Candidates for the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try, were they to be duly and properly examined as to Qualifications therefor, &s;uch as the Go&s;pel doth require, would be found evidently deficient.</P>
<P>BUT we de&s;ire to ble&s;s the Lord, we &s;ometimes find a hopeful Mea&s;ure of all Go&s;pel Qualifications, in the Candidate under Examination; and thereupon, when called, with unutterable &s;olemn Plea&s;ure, proceed to &s;e|perate him to the Work of the evangelical Mini&s;try, according to Go&s;pel Order. Sometimes the Candidate appears po&s;&s;e&s;t of a Mea&s;ure of all nece&s;&s;ary Qualifica|tions, but 'tis dubious whether in a Degree equal to what ought to be judged &s;ufficient;&mdash;&s;ometimes there
<PB N="27" REF="008808_0048_102FF01014D5B1C8">
may appear great Deficiency as to &s;ome one Qualifica|tion, ex.&punc; gr. aptne&s;s to teach;&mdash;&s;ometimes we are greatly exerci&s;ed, as in Doubt, about the Reality of the Candidate's experimental Religion: It may be, he has more Confidence than Evidence, or hone&s;tly tells us, that he has near upon an equal Mea&s;ure of Fears and Hopes, as to his &s;aving Knowledge of the Lord&punc; and upon due Examination of him, with Re&s;pect thereto, 'tis much &s;o with us, &s;o that our judgment of Charity, &s;eems in a Mea&s;ure &s;u&s;pended. We are full of Tender|ne&s;s toward hopeful Youth, are unwilling to damp any agreeable Appearances, and to prevent U&s;efulne&s;s; at the &s;ame Time, fear to run before the Call of Provi|dence, tremble at the Thought of giving the <HI>Ark</HI> a wrong touch; and upon the Whole, are ready to &s;ay, we know not what to do! To which permit me to reply, That when we know not what to do, we mu&s;t not do we know not what. In the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, our Hopes mu&s;t exceed our Fears, or we can't proceed to promote the Candidate, with a good Con&s;cience. He who &s;uppo&s;es his Judgment in <HI>equi-librio,</HI> is in the Quality of a <HI>non Liquet,</HI> and nothing can be done by him actively: And &s;hould this be the Ca&s;e with the greater Part of the Examiners, the Candidate mu&s;t &s;tand by, 'till he becomes po&s;&s;e&s;t of brighter Evidence of Divine Grace. And now, where is the &s;eemingly great Difficulty and Perplexity? Does it not abate, or rather evani&s;h? Is not Duty plain before us? Does our Lord require more of us than is rea&s;onable? He neither re|quires, nor expects that we &s;hould be infallible Judges of the &s;piritual State of Men, but that we exerci&s;e a rational, Chri&s;tian Judgment, according to Light; and that we be faithful to the Tru&s;t depo&s;ited in us, keeping our Con&s;ciences void of Offence toward Him.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have &s;poken my Opinion the more freely, becau&s;e I am well a&s;&s;ured that &s;ome of my <HI>Co<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">al</HI> and younger Brethren, have been at Times greatly exerci&s;ed in Ca&s;es &s;imilar to the&s;e I have mentioned, and on the Account of the too frequent &s;uper|ficial Examination of Candidates, as in their Opinion; whil&s;t the Situation of &s;ome of them, as amid&s;t Diver&s;ity of Sentiment, renders the Temptation additionally &s;trong, not to act up to their Principles: I pray the Lord, that they may be found faithful, and enjoy Peace of Con&s;cience!

<PB N="28" REF="008808_0049_102FF012B824E108">

<P>To commit the Mini&s;try to an unconverted, an un|experienc'd Man, is to commit it to a Man that is not likely to an&s;wer the important and excellent De&s;igns and Purpo&s;es of the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try. A very &s;hocking Thought! He may indeed help to keep up the Form of Religion for a Time; but if Religion &s;hould revive and flouri&s;h, by the out-pouring of the holy Spirit from on high; partly through Ignorance and Enmity, and partly from Pride and Envy, (which breed a Hell in the Bo&s;om where they dwell) at the Succe&s;s of others; (unle&s;s he receive Conviction of his awful State) he is quite likely to oppo&s;e, not only &s;ome Imprudences, common in &s;uch a Day, but al&s;o the E&s;&s;entials of the Work of GOD.</P>
<P>HE will probably commit the Mini&s;try to others, like him&s;elf; and in Proce&s;s of Time, now unborn Ages may feel, forever feel, the Weight of that HAND, which we lay upon the Head of the Man that has an un&s;ancti|fied HEART. And how dangerous the Enterpri&s;e for the Man him&s;elf! Upon the dreadful Suppo&s;ition, that he &s;hould never be converted, what Tongue can expre&s;s, what Thoughts conceive the dreadful Aggravations that will attend his eternal Perdition! No Doubt, if Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel are finally found Chri&s;tle&s;s and Gracele&s;s, of all Men living they will be the mo&s;t mi&s;erable. What Horror, Tribulation, and Angui&s;h, will &s;eize upon their guilty Hearts? and what Shame and Confu&s;ion will cover their Faces, when the dreadful Judge &s;hall come in flaming Fire, to take Vengeance upon the Di&s;obedient, and the Blood of lo&s;t Souls &s;hall cry for Vengeance again&s;t them! In a Word, as we Regard the Lord's Honour, the Pro&s;perity of <HI>Zion,</HI> the Salvation of Men,
<PB N="29" REF="008808_0050_102FF0143B6D4D78">
and Peace of Con&s;cience; let us take Care that we com|mit the Mini&s;try to faithful Men.</P>
<P>AND let us al&s;o be often engaged in an accurate Exa|mination of our Knowledge of the Lord Chri&s;t, and &s;eek renew'd Manife&s;tations, and the fulle&s;t A&s;&s;urances thereof. And, oh! how importunate we &s;hould be in Prayer, for the gracious Pre&s;ence of the Lord with us, and for the divine Influences to accompany our Mini&s;trations. Let us labour to &s;ee and feel our&s;elves living in a State of con&s;tant Dependence upon the Lord Chri&s;t, for the Reception of &s;uitable, &s;ea&s;onable, and &s;ufficient Grace, for all pre&s;ent Needs and Duties. The Purpo&s;es we &s;erve are &s;o high and God-like, our Work &s;o important, &s;o &s;piritual, &s;o difficult, and &s;o much above our Strength; how is it po&s;&s;ible to go on in it, without much of the Pre&s;ence of the Lord with us? Mo&s;t of the Work al|lotted us, is with God and Souls; it's about what is my&s;terious and &s;upernatural; it's of va&s;t Compa&s;s and great Variety, and Eternity is concern'd in what we are about; we had need therefore to be fill'd with the Spirit of Grace and Holine&s;s, to have a double Portion of his Gifts and Graces, of his Aid and Influence. Thereupon we &s;hall become wi&s;e to win Souls, and hopefully &s;uc|ce&s;sful; and finally, &s;hine as the Stars yea, as the Sun, in the Kingdom of our GOD and Father, for ever and ever.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My young Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I always feel great Tenderne&s;s toward hopeful Youth, who have &s;erious Thoughts toward engaging in the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try; e&s;pecially toward you, who have mo&s;t of you, for a Time, &s;ojourned under my Roof, prin|cipally pur&s;uing <HI>Theological</HI> Studies. Suffer me therefore to addre&s;s you by Way of Exhortation, to &s;ee to it that you know the Lord JESUS &s;avingly. Pre&s;ume not to re&s;t in the charitable Opinion of others, as your Evi|dence, that you &s;avingly know the Lord: You may have the Sanction of the charitable Hope and Judgment of <HI>Pre&s;byteries,</HI> or <HI>A&s;&s;ociations,</HI> and yet be eternally rejected by the Lord. The eternal Judge, "who&s;e Eyes are as a Flame of Fire," and who&s;e Prerogative alone it is to &s;earch the Heart; will one Day &s;ay to many, to Multitudes, that have prophe&s;ied, that have preached in his Name, I approve you not, depart from me.&mdash;If they who have preach'd in his Name, may peri&s;h in his Wrath, how greatly it concerns them that preach, to have &s;atisfactory Evidence, by the Actings of Grace, that they truly know the Lord! To &s;ome, it may po&s;&s;ibly &s;eem a very bold A&s;&s;ertion, but I declare it in plain Terms, that no Man can ever prove to him&s;elf, that he was call'd of GOD, to engage in the holy Mini&s;try, who has never been effectually call'd by divine Grace, &s;o as to know the Lord &s;avingly. And unle&s;s you thus know the Lord, with what Heart, with what Confidence, can you enter upon the &s;acred Mini&s;try? If you &s;hould run the Ri&s;k, the awful Ri&s;k&punc; void of &s;uch Knowledge, what Comfort can you take therein? Or what of Succe&s;s can you expect thereupon? Without Controver&s;y, it will one Day be a Soul puzzling, Soul confounding Que&s;tion to many, "Man, who made you a Mini&s;ter?" Who gave the Commi&s;&s;ion to treat for <HI>Chri&s;t?</HI> And to whom, but them, who preach an unknown <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and and who run before they were &s;ent, as regardle&s;s of Go&s;pel Order? I be&s;eech you therefore, <HI>my young Friends,</HI> that in the fir&s;t Place you be well &s;atisfied that you
<PB N="34" REF="008808_0055_102FF02329204E18">
&s;avingly know the Lord. Ply, warmly ply the Throne of Grace, that you may become rich in Experience of divine Grace, and that you may enjoy copious Mea&s;ures of divine Influence. Go on indeed to &s;eek all u&s;eful and &s;uitable Furniture for the great Work you have in View, and never imagine you have come to a <HI>ne plus ultra.</HI> Amid&s;t other Parts of u&s;eful Learning, &s;tudy Oratory, and artful Method of Addre&s;s; but re&s;t not here. If you had all Knowledge, and under&s;tood all My&s;teries, and could u&s;e all the Force of Per&s;uation, and Charms of Eloquence; were you furni&s;h'd with all the flowing Oratory of <HI>Cicero,</HI> and all the Thunder of <HI>Demo&s;thenes;</HI> and could you employ them in every Sermon you preach; yet, without the gracious Pre&s;ence of the Lord with you, you would in Reality be but as the &s;ounding Bra&s;s and tinkling Cymbal, that makes an empty Noi&s;e and u&s;ele&s;s Mu&s;ick. I pray GOD, that the Day in which we live, may not be a Day in which the true <HI>Spirit</HI> of preaching becomes lo&s;t, for want of due Regard to the Influences of the holy Spirit. While the Study and U&s;e of fine Language and Oratory are &s;o much in Vogue among Preachers, and &s;o plea&s;ing to many Hearers, as at this Day, and tend &s;o much to recommend the Preacher, and to promote his Reputation, the Temptation, to the young Preacher e&s;pecially, is prodigiou&s;ly powerful to &s;ub&s;titute the&s;e Things in the Room of the Divine Pre|&s;ence and A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and to re&s;t in them. But alas, for us that preach! alas for them that hear, when it &s;hall become thus! In the Eye of a judicious &s;piritual Hearer, can it look like preaching the everla&s;ting Go&s;pel, and having to do with the eternal GOD, and immortal Souls, for Time and endle&s;s Worlds, to make the Pulpit a meer Stage, and ju&s;t to flouri&s;h out a pretty pert Har|rangue, top'd up with one or two general jejune Infe|rences? How much &s;oever this may plea&s;e the vitiated Ta&s;te and Humours of &s;ome, the two di&s;tant Poles are not more remote from each other, than &s;uch Manner of Pulpit Work from a genuine Aptitude and Tendency to
<PB N="35" REF="008808_0056_102FF02527523538">
pierce the Heart, to awaken the Con&s;cience, and to do good to the Souls of Men. 'Tis true indeed, Men have their various Gifts, Talents, and Turns of Mind; 'tis natural to &s;ome Men to communicate their Thoughts in a correct, ma&s;culine, nervous, &s;triking and charming Stile and Diction; as truly natural, it appears beautiful. Some &s;uch there are, who from the &s;piritual Frame of their Hearts, are zealous, lively and practical Preachers, and excel in making the mo&s;t warm Applications and earne&s;t Addre&s;&s;es to the Hearts and Con&s;ciences of them that hear. Their Delivery and Ge&s;tures are natural, grave and decent, Action is lively and &s;ignificant, void of Affectation; their Sermons are evidently calculated, not to gratify Men's Curio&s;ity with plea&s;ing Speculations, but to pierce their Hearts with pungent Convictions; not to plea&s;e their Fances, but to awaken their Con|&s;ciences, and to convert and &s;ave their Souls. They appear as Men who have been with GOD in private, and thereupon &s;peak by his &s;pecial A&s;&s;i&s;tance in publick; the&s;e are doubtle&s;s ju&s;tly celebrated Preachers of the Go&s;pel. If we would act the Orator, the Mini&s;ter, or the Chri&s;tian, we mu&s;t endeavour to know and to culti|vate the peculiar Turn of our own Mind, and not indulge a vain Affectation, nor Attempt a forced Imi|tation of any Man. It will appear unnatural and di&s;|agreeable to a judicious Hearer, when it becomes too evident, that the Preacher who has not a natural &s;pon|taneous flow of ready and elegant Expre&s;&s;ions, has la|bour'd hard to poli&s;h his little Compo&s;ition, by the con|&s;tant Glitter of &s;hining Phra&s;es, by arranging his Words, beautifying his Language, rounding his Periods, &s;o as really to &s;tiffen his Di&s;cour&s;e: When by minding little Things over much, he has betray'd the Want of a Heart deeply aw'd and impre&s;s's with a Sen&s;e of what he is about, and the Want of a due Regard to divine Influ|ences, and a pointed Form of Addre&s;s, &s;uch as is ge|nerally to be found in the Sermons which our Lord Chri&s;t preached. While loo&s;e and general Harangues
<PB N="36" REF="008808_0057_102FF027B3B00A58">
are now grown &s;o fa&s;hionable in Pulpits, that the true Spirit of evangelical Preaching may not be lo&s;t, let young Preachers learn true Oratory from <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> and &s;eek copious Mea&s;ures of his gracious, &s;piritual Pre&s;ence with them. That Preacher has hit upon the true Ma&s;ter-Key of &s;acred Eloquence, and obtain'd the be&s;t Part of a Pulpit Orator, who is Ma&s;ter of a good Di&s;cour&s;e, and is &s;kilful in applying of it, in its full Weight home upon the Con&s;ciences of Men, who knows how to lay open the human Heart, and trace it's Windings, it's Di&s;gui&s;es and Corruptions, and how to draw Voice and Pa&s;&s;ion from the Heart, &s;o that every one &s;hall hear, &s;ee, and recognize him&s;elf, and &s;tand acquitted or condemn'd in his own Brea&s;t, according as he de&s;erves one or the other: But no Man is like to do <HI>this</HI> to Purpo&s;e, unle&s;s the Lord is with him, and &s;peaks by him. Labour and Art may make a Man an elegant and correct Speaker, &s;o as to be much admir'd by him&s;elf, and by tho&s;e who &s;eek nothing farther; but I will be bold to &s;ay, that no Man can become a real powerful Chri&s;tian Orator, unle&s;s the Lord is with him, impre&s;&s;es divine Truth upon his Heart, and helps him in &s;ome good Mea&s;ure to preach as he ought, "even in Demon&s;tration of the Spirit and of Power." I be&s;eech you, <HI>Sirs,</HI> labour to be Ma&s;ter of the Subject you handle, to be full of it, to be tho|roughly enlighten'd and warm'd with it, to feel every Sentiment you deliver, and every Pa&s;&s;ion you mean to in&s;pire. Remember the Pulpit is a Place in which Men ordinarily affect to &s;hine, in Brightne&s;s of Sentiment, Finene&s;s of Compo&s;ition, and a Gracefulne&s;s of Elocu|tion; and if the Preacher does but think, (and 'tis a Wonder if he don't) that he has obtain'd the Reputation of a fine Speaker, great is the Force of Temptation, to bring him under the Power of Pride and Self-Admira|tion. And that he may now de&s;pi&s;e the Smiles, as well as Frowns of the People, and by Humility be kept &s;afe, as not forming big Ideas of his own Importance, and his own Performance; and that he may have a Mind

exalted in all Re&s;pects above this World, and above it|&s;elf how much he needs a Combination of grand and &s;olemn Views of divine Objects, and Things Eternal, by the gracious Pre&s;ence of the Lord with him? The Lord being thus with you, you will &s;ink into Nothing; feel le&s;s than an Attom, as &s;truck with the Maje&s;ty of his Perfections, and tran&s;ported with the Wonders of his Love: Now you will &s;ee the Beauty, Glory, and Excellence, now Ta&s;te the Sweetne&s;s, and feel the Power of divine Grace and Truth upon the Heart; and now you will be filled with Bowels of Compa&s;&s;ion and God|like Pity toward the Souls of Men: And now your Manner of Preaching, will nece&s;&s;arily be in&s;tructive, warm, ca&s;ui&s;tical and pathetical; addre&s;&s;ed often to the Con&s;ciences, and frequently to the Affections of your Hearers; the mo&s;t hopeful Method to enlighten and vivify others. After all, ever remember, that the &s;aving Efficacy of all Means, depends upon the Co-operation of the holy Spirit; powerful <HI>Paul</HI> may plant, and eloquent <HI>Apollos</HI> water, 'tis God giveth the Increa&s;e: Therefore you mu&s;t be very conver&s;ant with Heaven, importunate, ince&s;&s;ant at the Throne of Grace, praying the Lord to grant divine Influences to the People, as well as to your|&s;elves: And if he &s;o does, and works by you, a&s;cribe all the Glory to him, to his free and &s;overeign Grace. In fine, <HI>my dear Sirs,</HI> be &s;ure that you always give due Honours to the Aids and Influences of the holy Spirit; and thus, 'tis hopeful, you will become powerful and &s;uc|ce&s;sful Preachers of the Go&s;pel; and thus may the Lord be with you and ble&s;s you, and make you Ble&s;&s;ings in your Day, and finally Crown you with immortal Glory!</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly and la&s;tly, I turn the Addre&s;s, in few Words, to the Body of the People.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have heard what for Preachers Men ought to be; and thereby what for a Man you ought to choo&s;e, when Occa&s;ion calls for your choice, &s;uch a Man, who
<PB N="38" REF="008808_0059_102FF02D23A048F8">
in a Judgment of Charity &s;avingly knows the Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t:</HI> And does it not argue the Worth of your Souls, and the Importance of your Salvation, that Men mu&s;t be endued with &s;uch rich Furniture, in order to preach the Go&s;pel to you. As for tho&s;e of you, who &s;avingly know the Lord Chri&s;t, and thereby have the fir&s;t Dawn|ings and Pledges of an immortal Day of Glory, &s;hout forth the Prai&s;es of &s;overeign Grace, and labour to grow in the Knowledge of him, and thereby to increa&s;e in Holine&s;s and Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s. Ye that are &s;ecure in <HI>Zion,</HI> know ye, that to know the only true GOD, and <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> is eternal Life; and that to remain &s;ecure and ignorant, is eternal Death. Ye awaken'd Sinners, (for ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord there are &s;ome &s;uch) know ye, that the holy Spirit will &s;trive with you, but for a limitted Time; your eternal All depends upon his Influence and Agency, therefore grieve him not. You appear &s;olici|tous to know what you mu&s;t do to be &s;aved, know ye, that you mu&s;t believe in the Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> &s;o &s;hall ye be &s;aved.&mdash;In a Word, to conclude, may we All, Mini&s;ters, and People, old and young, high and low, rich and poor, Negroes and Indians together, One and All; account all Things but Lo&s;s and Damage, for the Excellency of the Knowledge of the Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t;</HI> and thus become truly ble&s;&s;ed now, and be inconceivably ble&s;&s;ed, through the unmea&s;urable Revolutions of Eter|nity; which GOD of his infinite Mercy grant! For the divine Mediator's Sake. AMEN, and AMEN.</P>
