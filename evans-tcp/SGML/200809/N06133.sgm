<L>Seiz'd on a Part of GEORGE's Land,</L>

<L>Our Hero, tho' aver&s;e to War,</L>

<L>That all he &s;aid on Self-Defence,</L>

<L>He hourly now impatient grows,</L>
<L>To meet the Foe&punc; and come to Blows.</L>
<L>But quite aver&s;e to &s;hedding Blood,</L>
<L>Our valiant Warrier held it good,</L>

<L>To take a more pacific Cour&s;e:</L>
<L>He therefore &s;ent a tru&s;ty Hand,</L>

<L>He freely would &s;ubmit his Ca&s;e,</L>

<L>And would abide the Judgment there.</L>
<L>But LEWIS of his Prowe&s;s vain,</L>
<L>Treated this Me&s;&s;age with Di&s;dain.</L>
<L>"Go back, <HI>Quoth he,</HI> and tell your Lord,</L>
<L>"That I try Titles by the Sword;</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>NO &s;ooner had the King of Day,</L>

</LG>

<L>This &s;aid they in&s;tantly engage,</L>
<L>With manly Strength, and martial Rage,</L>
<L>A bloody Combat long they held,</L>
<L>Each Side unknowing how to yield.</L>
<L>They &s;ought as brave, &s;ome Authors tell us,</L>
<L>As did fam'd <HI>Hector</HI> and <HI>Achilles;</HI></L>
<L>And a&s;king both the&s;e Heroes Pardon,</L>
<L>They laid each other full as hard on.</L>
<L>At length our Warrier fill'd with Shame,</L>
<L>Unto a clo&s;e Engagement came,</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="007788_0008_102D8B5F46B81F90">And &s;oon let LEWIS under&s;tand,</L>

<L>For, now, alas! the Crim&s;on Tide,</L>
<L>Flow'd freely from the Aggre&s;&s;or's Side;</L>
<L>And tho' he &s;carce his Sword could wield,</L>
<L>His Pride forbad his Heart to yield.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When GEORGE perceiving his Di&s;tre&s;s,</L>
<L>His haughty Foe did thus addre&s;s:</L>
<L>"LEWIS, <HI>Quoth he,</HI> let's end the Strife;</L>
<L>"Re&s;tore my Land, and take thy Life."</L>
<L><HI>Quoth</HI> LEWIS; "Know, that &s;till I live,</L>

<L>Thus he; when at our Warrier's Head,</L>
<L>With both his Hands a Blow he made;</L>
<L>But GEORGE, who kept a watchful Eye,</L>
<L>Perceiv'd the Stroke, and put it by,</L>
<L>And at this U&s;age quite enrag'd,</L>
<L>His Foe with double Force engag'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NOW LEWIS, when it was too late,</L>

<L><HI>Crying,</HI> Now all our Fears are fled,</L>

<L>May Heaven its choice&s;t Gifts be&s;tow,</L>
<L>Upon the Man that gave the Blow.</L>

<L>Nor could he &s;top the flowing Tears</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="007788_0009_102D8B6189DA4338">But &s;tood&punc; revolving in his Mind,</L>
