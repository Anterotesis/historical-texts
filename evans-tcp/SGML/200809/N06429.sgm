The Governor opened the Conferences with the following Ceremonies, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to all the Indians pre&s;ent, of every Nation.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<Q><P>IT gives me great Plea&s;ure to &s;ee &s;o many of you, and of &s;o many different Nations, at this Council Fire. I bid you heartily Welcome.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>With this String, I wipe the Sweat and Du&s;t out of your Eyes, that you may &s;ee your Brethren's Faces, and look chearful. With this String, I take all Bitterne&s;s out of your Brea&s;t, as well as every Thing di&s;agreeable that may have gathered there, in Order that you may &s;peak perfectly free and open to us. With this String, I gather the Blood, and take it away from the Council Seats, that your Cloaths may not be &s;tained, nor your Minds any ways di&s;turbed.</P></Q>
<P><HI>Three Strings.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Wei&s;er</HI> interpreted the Sub&s;tance of this Speech, and &s;aying, his Memory did not &s;erve him to remember the &s;everal Ceremonies in U&s;e on this Occa&s;ion, he de&s;ired <HI>Nichas,</HI> a <HI>Mohawk</HI> Chief, to do it for him; which he did; and all was afterwards interpreted by Captain <HI>Henry Montour,</HI> in the <HI>Delaware</HI> Language, to <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> and the <HI>Delawares.</HI></P>
<P>After a &s;hort Pau&s;e, <HI>Taga&s;hata,</HI> the <HI>Seneca</HI> Chief, ro&s;e up, and repeating, as u&s;ual, each Paragraph di&s;tinctly, as &s;poke by the Governor, he returned Thanks, and went through the &s;ame Ceremonies to the Governor, Council and People of the Province; adding on the la&s;t String, <Q>That their Great-Grand-Fathers had told them, that they had made a Road for them to travel to their Brethren the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and that whenever it &s;hould be &s;topped, they would become a poor People. They were very glad to find the Road open to their Brethren, and &s;hould take Care to pre&s;erve it &s;o on their Side.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Three Strings.</HI></P>
<P>After Mr&punc; <HI>Wei&s;er</HI> had delivered this in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and it was interpreted in the <HI>Delaware</HI> Language, by <HI>Mo&s;es Tetamy; Taga&s;hata</HI> proceeded:</P>
<Q><P><HI>Brother</HI> ONAS,</P>
<P>By this Belt you &s;ent an Invitation to us to come to <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> which reached our Towns about the Time that the Leaves put out la&s;t Spring; but we were then &s;o much alarmed by the <HI>French,</HI> who were near us, that we could not then leave our Country. Some little Time ago we received another Belt from Sir <HI>William John&s;on,</HI> which he informed us was &s;ent to him by you, to be forwarded to us, to enquire into the Rea&s;ons why we did not come to you, according to your fir&s;t Invitation; and Sir <HI>William John&s;on</HI> de&s;ired us to come here, to meet you in Council; upon which we immediately aro&s;e, and came as &s;oon as we could, to your Council Fire, and now we are here, as you &s;ee.</P></Q>
<P><HI>Two Belts.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<Q><P>Here is another Belt by which we were invited lately to come to a Council Fire that was kindled in an I&s;land near the Sea. This &s;urprized us, as we never heard of a Council Fire in an I&s;land. We know of no Council Fires, but the Old Council Fire at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> and the Great Council Fire in <HI>Albany.</HI></P></Q>
<P><HI>Here he laid the Belt on the Table.</HI></P>
<P>Then taking four other Strings of Wampum, he &s;aid, <Q>The&s;e were &s;ent by <HI>Nichas,</HI> the <HI>Mohawk</HI> Chief, with a Me&s;&s;age that he was arrived in this Province, and de&s;ired we would comply with the Invitation and come down.</Q> Here he laid the four Strings on the Table. <HI>Nichas</HI> having acknowledged the Me&s;&s;age, and taken up the Strings, <HI>Taga&s;hata</HI> concluded, &s;aying, <Q>The&s;e are your Belts, by which we were invited to come to this Council Fire; and as we are now come, we return them, and de&s;ire to &s;ee the Belts that were &s;ent by us, particularly one, on which were &s;everal Images of Men holding each other by the Hand.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="008157_0006_102E3E9F102481E0">
The Governor replied, that he would enquire for the Belts &s;ent by them, and they &s;hould be returned.</P>

Mr. <HI>Groghan</HI> reque&s;ted to know, if what he was going to &s;ay was the Re&s;ult of the <HI>Delaware</HI> Council, and if it was their De&s;ire it &s;hould be &s;poke fir&s;t; but no An&s;wer was given him as to this.</P>
<P>Governor BERNARD &s;ignifying his De&s;ire to bid the Indians welcome, and ju&s;t mention to them the Bu&s;ine&s;s he came upon, it was agreed he &s;hould &s;peak fir&s;t; which he did as follows.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<Q><P>I AM glad to &s;ee &s;o many of you met together, to cultivate Peace with your Brethren and old Friends the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> I heartily bid you welcome, and wi&s;h that the good Work for which you are now a&s;&s;embled, may pro&s;per in your Hands, and have that Succe&s;s, which your wi&s;e Men, and all that wi&s;h you well, mu&s;t de&s;ire as a Thing much to your Advantage.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="008157_0007_102E3EA28F7DCE18">
The Situation of the Province over which I pre&s;ide, and the Di&s;po&s;ition of it's People, have hitherto afforded very little Occa&s;ion for Treaties with the neighbouring Indians; but having &s;ome Months ago &s;ent a Me&s;&s;age to the <HI>Mini&s;inks,</HI> I received a Me&s;&s;age from our Brethren the <HI>Senecas</HI> and <HI>Cayugas,</HI> wherein they take upon them to an&s;wer my Me&s;&s;age to the <HI>Mini&s;inks,</HI> and de&s;ire that I would meet them at the Council Fire burning at this Place.</P>
<P>It is not u&s;ual for the King's Governors to go out of their Provinces to attend Treaties; but I am glad to have an Opportunity of &s;hewing my good Di&s;po&s;ition to e&s;tabli&s;h Peace and Friend&s;hip with my Neighbours, and therefore I have waved a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Forms, and am come here according to the Invitation I received at <HI>Burlington.</HI></P>
<P>To you therefore, our Brethren the <HI>Senecas</HI> and <HI>Cayugas,</HI> and your Nephews the <HI>Mini&s;inks,</HI> I now &s;peak, and de&s;ire that you would take into your mo&s;t &s;erious Con&s;idera|tion, my Me&s;&s;age to the <HI>Mini&s;inks,</HI> your Me&s;&s;age to me, and my An&s;wer thereto, and let me know what we are to expect from you.</P>
<P>What is pa&s;t we are willing to forget; but I mu&s;t remind you, that if you are di&s;|po&s;ed to be our Friends for the future, you &s;hou'd give us that Proof of your Sincerity which I have de&s;ired in my An&s;wer to your Me&s;&s;age, and return us the Captives that have been taken out of our Province, and are now within your Power: This &s;hould be one of the fir&s;t Steps, and will be the be&s;t that can be taken towards re&s;toring and con|firming that Brotherly Love and Friend&s;hip between us; which, I am convinced, will be for the mutual Benefit of all Parties.</P></Q>
<P>This was interpreted in the Six Nations Language, by Mr. <HI>Wei&s;er,</HI> and in the <HI>Dela|ware,</HI> by Mr. <HI>Stephen Calvin,</HI> the <HI>Indian</HI> Schoolma&s;ter in <HI>We&s;t Jer&s;ey.</HI></P>
<P>Then <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> &s;poke,</P>
<Q><P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I de&s;ire all of you who are pre&s;ent will give Ear to me. As you, my Brethren, de&s;ired me to call all the Nations who live back; I have done &s;o. Now if you have any Thing to &s;ay to them, or they to you, you mu&s;t &s;it and talk together.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I &s;it by, only to hear and &s;ee what you &s;ay to one another; for I have &s;aid what I have to &s;ay to the Governor of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> who &s;its here; he knows what has pa&s;&s;ed between us. I have made known to him the Rea&s;on why I &s;truck him. Now, I and the Governor have made up the&s;e Differences between him and me; and I think we have done it as far as we can, for our future Peace.</P></Q>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P>The above Speech was interpreted in the Six Nation Language.</P>
<P><HI>Taga&s;hata</HI> then ro&s;e up, and &s;poke,</P>
<P><HI>Brethren, the Governors, and your Councils,</HI></P>
<Q><P>IT has plea&s;ed the Mo&s;t High, that we meet together here with chearful Countenances, and a good Deal of Satisfaction: And as publick Bu&s;ine&s;s requires great Con&s;idera|tion, and the Day is almo&s;t &s;pent, I choo&s;e to &s;peak early To-morrow Morning.</P></Q>
<P>The Governors an&s;wer'd, That they &s;hould be glad to give all the Di&s;patch po&s;&s;ible to this good Work they were engaged in, and de&s;ired the Chiefs would fix the Time of Meeting; but they declined it, &s;aying, <Q>They were unacquainted with Hours, but would give Notice when they were ready.</Q></P>

<P><PB N="8" REF="008157_0008_102E3EA5646E9578">
<HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<Q><P>We approve of every Article mentioned to us Ye&s;terday, by the Governor of <HI>Jer&s;ey</HI>; all that he &s;aid is very good: We look upon his Me&s;&s;age to us, as a Com|mi&s;&s;ion and Reque&s;t from him, that we &s;hould bring Matters to a good Conclu&s;ion with our Cou&s;ins the <HI>Mini&s;inks.</HI> They them&s;elves &s;ent for us to do the &s;ame Thing, on their Behalf; and at their Reque&s;t we came here, have taken it in Hand, and will u&s;e our utmo&s;t Endeavours to bring about the good Work which Governor BERNARD de&s;ires, and do not doubt but it will be done to his entire Satisfaction.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I now &s;peak at the Reque&s;t of <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> and our Nephews the <HI>Delawares,</HI> living at <HI>Wyomink</HI> and on the Waters of the River <HI>Sa&s;quehannah.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>We now remove the Hatchet out of your Heads, that was &s;truck into it by our Cou&s;ins the <HI>Delawares:</HI> It was a <HI>French</HI> Hatchet that they unfortunately made u&s;e of, by the In&s;tigation of the <HI>French</HI>: We take it out of your Heads, and bury it under Ground, where it &s;hall always re&s;t and never be taken up again. Our Cou&s;ins the <HI>Delawares,</HI> have a&s;&s;ured us they will never think of War again&s;t their Brethren the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> any more, but employ their Thoughts about Peace, and cultivating Friend|&s;hip with them, and never &s;uffer Enmity again&s;t them to enter into their Minds again.</P></Q>
<P>The <HI>Delawares</HI> de&s;ired us to &s;ay this for them by this Belt.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<Q><P>Our Nephews the <HI>Mini&s;ink</HI> Indians, and three other different Tribes of that Nation, have, at la&s;t, li&s;tened to us, and taken our Advice, and laid down the Hatchet they had taken up again&s;t their Brethren the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> They told us they had received it from the <HI>French,</HI> but had already laid it down, and would return it to them again.</P>
<P>They a&s;&s;ured us, they would never u&s;e it any more again&s;t you, but would follow our Advice; and entreated us to u&s;e our utmo&s;t Endeavours to reconcile them to you their Brethren, declaring they were very &s;orry for what they had done, and de&s;ired it might be forgotten, and they would forever cultivate a good Friend&s;hip with you. The&s;e Declarations were made by the principal Warriors of four Tribes of the <HI>Mini&s;ink</HI> Indians, at giving us this Belt.</P></Q>

<P>A Road has been made from our Country to this Council Fire, that we might treat about Friend&s;hip; and as we came down the Road, we &s;aw, that by &s;ome Misfortune or other, Blood has lately been &s;pilt on it.

<P><HI>Here his Honour returned the Belt.</HI></P>
<Q><P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>

<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>By the&s;e Eight Strings of black Wampum, you, the <HI>Mohawks, Sonecas</HI> and <HI>Onon|dagas,</HI> told us, that you had not only brought about an Union with the <HI>Delawares</HI> and <HI>Mini&s;inks,</HI> on the Waters of the River <HI>Sa&s;quehannah,</HI> but had al&s;o &s;ent Me&s;&s;ages to the <HI>Indians</HI> now on the <HI>Ohio,</HI> as well tho&s;e of tho&s;e two Nations, as tho&s;e of the Six Nations under the <HI>French</HI> Influence, de&s;iring them to lay down the Hatchet, and enter again into Friend&s;hip with their Brethren the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>; and on their Behalf, you have taken the Hatchets out of our Heads, &s;o far as to lay a Foundation for a future Peace.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren, the</HI> Mohawks, Senecas <HI>and</HI> Onondagas,</P>
<P>This was a very friendly Part, and we flatter our&s;elves they will hearken to you, as there are now Deputies here from tho&s;e Indians on the <HI>Ohio,</HI> with Me&s;&s;ages to us, which will be delivered in Publick.</P>
<P>We accept your Strings, and approve your taking the Hatchet, on the Behalf of the <HI>Ohio</HI> Indians, out of our Heads, &s;o far as to make it the Foundation of a future Peace.</P>

<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>You may remember that the Day before Ye&s;terday, your Nephew <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> told me by this String, <Q>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> he had already &s;aid to me at our former Meetings every Thing he had to &s;ay, and had made me acquainted with the Cau&s;e why he had &s;truck us, and that I knew what had pa&s;&s;ed between us. That we had made up all Dif|ferences, and had done it as far as we could, for our future Peace.</Q></P>
<P><Q>That at my Reque&s;t he had given the Halloo, and brought down to this Place, you who heard him and are now pre&s;ent; and that he would &s;it by, and hear what we &s;aid together,</Q></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="008157_0011_102E3EAF4E3AB340">
<HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>As there are a great many of you here who were not pre&s;ent at our former Meetings, I think it proper for your Information, to give you a &s;hort Account of what has pa&s;&s;ed between your Nephews the <HI>Delawares</HI> and us.</P>
<P>About three Years ago, your Brethren the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> living on the Borders of this Province were &s;truck on a Sudden, at a Time when they were in profound Peace with you and following their Bu&s;ine&s;s &s;u&s;pecting no Danger: Many were killed, and others carried away Captive.</P>
<P>We were &s;urprized and did not know who &s;truck us, but &s;ent Me&s;&s;engers up the <HI>Su&s;quebannab,</HI> as far as the Country of the United Nations, to enquire whence the Blow came and for what Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>On the Return of the&s;e Me&s;&s;engers, we were informed that the Hatchet had been &s;truck into our Heads by our Countrymen the <HI>Delawares</HI> and <HI>Shawane&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Some Time after this Di&s;covery was made, a Ce&s;&s;ation of Ho&s;tilities was brought about by the United Nations, at our Reque&s;t made to them for that Purpo&s;e by Sir <HI>William John&s;on</HI>; and upon our Invitation, our Brother <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> came down with a Number of <HI>Delawares</HI> and other Indians to a Council Fire kindled at this Place, where we have &s;ince had &s;everal Meetings.</P>
<P>At one of the&s;e Meetings <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> told us that the Cau&s;e of the War was, that their fooli&s;h young Men had been per&s;uaded by the fal&s;e-hearted <HI>French</HI> King, to &s;trike their Brethren the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>; and one Rea&s;on why the Blow came harder was that the Pro|prietors of this Province had taken from them by Fraud, the Ground we now &s;tand on, and all the Lands lying between <HI>Tobiccon Creek</HI> and <HI>Wyomink,</HI> on the River <HI>Su&s;quebannab.</HI></P>
<P>At la&s;t all Blood was wiped away and buried under Ground; and Peace Belts were exchanged between us and our Brother <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> who then told us, he acted in Behalf of ten Nations, and promi&s;ed to bring in and re&s;tore to us all our fellow Subjects that had been carried off Pri&s;oners by them. For the Truth of this &s;hort Relation I refer you to our Brother <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> who will confirm it to you more particularly.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P></Q>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<Q><P>To continue our Friend&s;hip it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve Faith and keep the Promi&s;es we make with each other. I will &s;peak plainly to you and from the Bottom of my Heart, as one Friend ought to another, that Nothing may lie heavy on my Mind to di&s;turb me hereafter; and I expect the &s;ame Openne&s;s and Freedom on your Parts.</P>
<P>I de&s;ire therefore to know the true Rea&s;on, why our Fle&s;h and Blood who are in Captivity and in your Power have not been delivered to us, according to the Promi&s;e made us by our Brother <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> in Behalf of all the Indians he repre&s;ented; and what is become of tho&s;e Belts we gave him to confirm the Peace, and that Promi&s;e. For till that Promi&s;e is complied with, we can never &s;leep in Quiet or re&s;t &s;atisfy'd in the Friend&s;hip of tho&s;e who detain our Children and Re|lations from us.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P></Q>
<P>After the Governor had done &s;peaking, the United Nations, being eight in all, gave the u&s;ual Cry of Approbation with great Solemnity, each Chief according to his Rank, crying <HI>Yoban</HI>; which was an&s;wered by all the Indians pre&s;ent, in a &s;olemn, mu&s;ical and uni&s;onal Tone.</P>
<P>Then Goveror BERNARD delivered the Belts reque&s;ted by the <HI>Senecas, Cayugas</HI> and <HI>Mini&s;inks,</HI> and &s;poke as follows;</P>
<Q><P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>The Governor of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> has given a particular An&s;wer to what has been &s;aid to us both. So far as his An&s;wer relates to the Province over which I pre&s;ide, I confirm what has been &s;aid by this Belt.</P>

Previous to what follows, it is nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that <HI>Pi&s;quetomen</HI> and another <HI>Ohio</HI> Indian having come to <HI>Philadelphia</HI> la&s;t Summer, acquainted the Governor, that the Indians in tho&s;e Parts had not received any Account of the late Tran&s;actions with this Government nor any Me&s;&s;age from it; nor had any Thing been done that they might be per&s;uaded to lay down the Hatchet. The Governor therefore took that Opportunity to &s;end a friendly Me&s;&s;age to tho&s;e Indians by <HI>Pi&s;quetomen,</HI> and appointed Mr. <HI>Frederick Po&s;t,</HI> a <HI>German,</HI> who under&s;tood the <HI>Delaware</HI> Language, to attend him and acquaint the Indians at <HI>Ohio,</HI> of the Peace made by the <HI>Su&s;quebannab, Delawares</HI> and other Indians, and the Di&s;po&s;ition of this Government to forgive what was pa&s;t, if they wou'd return to their antient Alliance. This Me&s;&s;age was accordingly delivered, and an An&s;wer returned by <HI>Frederick Po&s;t, Pi&s;quetomen,</HI> and <HI>Thomas Hick|man,</HI> an <HI>Ohio</HI> Indian, who having come down together as far as <HI>Harri&s;s</HI>'s Ferty, <HI>Frederick Po&s;t</HI> went to wait on General <HI>Forbes,</HI> and left the two Indians to proceed with the Me&s;&s;age; who being now arrived at <HI>Ea&s;ton, Pi&s;quetomen,</HI> who had the particular Charge of it, introduced it as follows.</P>
<Q><P>BRETHREN,</P>
<P>WHEN I was at <HI>Allegbeny,</HI> the Chief Men &s;at together as we do here now. I was employed by the Governor, <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> and <HI>I&s;rael Pemberton,</HI> the&s;e three Men, pointing to them: And the Chief Men told me, that when I &s;hou'd come among the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Inhabitants, I mu&s;t &s;hake Hands for them with the Governor, <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> and <HI>I&s;rael Pemberton</HI>; [Here he &s;hook Hands with them] and that what they had to &s;ay, was written down in a Paper, which he then produced, and &s;aid they de&s;ired it might be read in Publick. Now, you Gentlemen, who are Head Men, &s;ent <HI>Frederick Po&s;t</HI> with me, de&s;iring me to take and carry him in my Bo&s;om there, and when I came there, to introduce him to the publick Council. I did this, and have brought him back &s;ate to you again.</P></Q>
<P>Then taking a Belt and three Strings of Wampum, which were deliver'd with the Paper, he &s;aid, he wou'd interpret them; but as all that was &s;aid was truly &s;et down in the Writing, it was not nece&s;&s;ary. Let it be read. Then <HI>Pi&s;quetomen</HI> delivered the Paper, with the Belt and three Strings of Wampum; and, on being a&s;ked afterwards to whom they were &s;ent, an&s;wered, one was &s;ent to the Governor, another to <HI>Teedyu&s;|cung,</HI> and another to <HI>I&s;rael Pemberton.</HI></P>
<P>The Me&s;&s;age was read in the&s;e Words.</P>

<P><HI>Brethren,</HI> When all the Nations join in this Friend&s;hip, then the Day will begin to &s;hine clear over us. When we once more hear of you and we join together, then the Day will be &s;till and no Wind or Storm will come over us to di&s;turb us.</P>
<P>Now <HI>Brethren,</HI> you know our Hearts, and what we have told you in this, all the Nations agree to join and what we have to &s;ay: Be &s;trong; if you do &s;o, every Thing will be well, and what we have told you in this, all the Nations agree to join.</P>

<Q><P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>WE thought proper to meet you here to have &s;ome private Di&s;cour&s;e about our Nephew <HI>Teedyu&s;cung.</HI></P>
<P>You all know, that he gives out, he is the Great Man and Chief of Ten Nations: This is his con&s;tant Di&s;cour&s;e. Now I, on Behalf of the <HI>Mohawks,</HI> &s;ay, we do not know he is &s;uch a great Man. If he is &s;uch a great Man, we de&s;ire to know who has made him &s;o. Perhaps you have; and if this be the Ca&s;e, tell us &s;o. It may be the <HI>French</HI> have made him &s;o. We want to enquire and know whence his Greatne&s;s aro&s;e,</P></Q>
<P><HI>Taga&s;hata,</HI> on the Behalf of the <HI>Senecas,</HI> &s;poke next.</P>
<Q><P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I, for my Nation, &s;ay the &s;ame that <HI>Nichas</HI> has &s;aid; I need not repeat it. I &s;ay we do not know who has made <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> this Great Man over ten Nations; and I want to know who made him &s;o.</P></Q>
<P><HI>A&s;&s;arandungas</HI> &s;poke next on Behalf of the <HI>Onondagas.</HI></P>
<Q><P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I am here to repre&s;ent the <HI>Onondagas,</HI> and I &s;ay for them, that I never heard before now, that <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> was &s;uch a Great Man, much le&s;s can I tell who made him &s;o. No &s;uch Thing was ever &s;aid in our Towns, as that <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> was &s;uch a Great Man.</P></Q>
<P><HI>Thomas King</HI> &s;poke,</P>
<Q><P><HI>Brethren, The Governors and all pr&eacute;&s;ent.</HI></P>
<P>Take notice that I &s;peak in Behalf of five Nations, who have their Deputies here pre&s;ent, <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>Oneidos, Cayugas, Tu&s;caroras, Nanticokes</HI> and <HI>Conoys,</HI> who have joined together and now make one Nation, and <HI>Tuteloes.</HI> We five are all connected together, and if any Thing is &s;aid to one of us, it is communicated to all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>On their Behalf I now tell you, we none of us know who has made <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> &s;uch a great Man. Perhaps the <HI>French</HI> have, or perhaps you have, or &s;ome among you, as you have different Governments, and are different People. We for our Parts entirely di&s;own that he has any Authority over us, and de&s;ire to know, from whence he derives his Authority</P>

<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<Q><P>I &s;peak to you, on Behalf of the Nations ju&s;t now mentioned. You may remem|ber, that you &s;aid the other Day, you cou'd not be ea&s;y without your Pri&s;oners were returned. We have con&s;idered this, and I now a&s;&s;ure you, that they &s;hall be returned.</P>
<P>We &s;peak from the Bottom of our Hearts; we will look carefully into all our Towns for them: You &s;hall have them all; we will keep none. If there be any of them that have gone down our Throats, we will throw them up again. You told us a tender Father, Hu&s;band, Wi&s;e, Brother or Si&s;ter, cou'd not &s;leep found, when they reflected that their Relations were Pri&s;oners. We know it is &s;o with us, and we will therefore u&s;e our Endeavours to make your Hearts ea&s;y, and we give you this Belt, as a Promi&s;e that we will perform our Words.</P></Q>

<Q><P>I &s;peak now in Behalf of my own Nation, and my two other Brethren, Deputies of the <HI>Senecas</HI> and <HI>Onondagas.</HI> We remember you de&s;ired us to leave Nothing in our Hearts, but &s;peak open on every Matter, and you &s;aid you wou'd do the &s;ame to us.</P>
<P>You told us that you cou'd not &s;leep found whil&s;t your Pri&s;oners were detained from you, nor cou'd you have any Confidence in the Friend&s;hip of tho&s;e who did detain them.</P>
<P>We of the&s;e Three Nations promi&s;e, that we will u&s;e our be&s;t Endeavours to make you ea&s;y. When we return, we will enquire of every Town for the Pri&s;oners.

<HEAD>At a Conference with the <HI>Indians,</HI> on the 16th of <HI>October,</HI> 1758.</HEAD>
<P>PRESENT, The Governors and Gentlemen of their Council, &amp;<HI>c.</HI></P>
<P>The Minutes of the preceding Conference were read, and approved.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e of Ye&s;terday's private Conference were read at the particular De&s;ire of the Chiefs of the united Nations, and interpreted to <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> and the <HI>Delawares,</HI> by Mr. <HI>Stephen Calvin.</HI></P>
<P>The Governors then &s;poke &s;eparately; Governor <HI>DENNY</HI> beginning as follows: <HI>Brethren,</HI> the <HI>Mohawks, Onondagas, Senecas, Oneidas, Cayugas, Tu&s;caroras, Naticokes</HI> and <HI>Tuteloes</HI>;</P>
<Q><P>IN a Conference held with you Ye&s;terday, you told me, that we know your Nephew <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> gives out, that he is the great Man, and Chief of Ten Nations, and that this was his con&s;tant Di&s;cour&s;e; by this Belt therefore you denied him to be &s;o great a Man, and de&s;ired to know of me who made him &s;o, or gave him any Autho|rity over you.</P></Q>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<Q><P>I will an&s;wer you truly, and tell you in a few Words, all that I know of the Matter; I have already informed you, that after the <HI>Delawares</HI> had &s;truck us, you, our good Friends, the United Nations, advi&s;ed them to &s;it &s;till and do us no more Mi&s;chief; and that &s;oon after this, we invited the <HI>Delawares</HI> to meet us at a Council Fire kindled at this Place.</P>
<P>We received an An&s;wer to our Me&s;&s;age from <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> as a Chief among the <HI>Delawares:</HI> At the Time appointed he came and told us that he repre&s;ented ten Nations, among&s;t which the United Nations were included; that he acted as a Chief Man for the <HI>Delawares,</HI> but only as a Me&s;&s;enger from the United Nations, who were his Uncles and Superiors, to whom he wou'd faithfully carry every Thing that &s;hou'd be tran&s;ac|ted between us, that they might do as they &s;aw Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>We believed what your Nephew told us; and therefore made him a Coun&s;ellor and Agent for us, and de&s;ired him to publi&s;h to all Nations of <HI>Indians</HI> what we did at our Council Fires, and to let them know we were &s;incerely di&s;po&s;ed to be at Peace with them.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I can only &s;peak for my&s;elf, and do a&s;&s;ure you, that I never made <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> this Great Man, nor ever pretended to give him any Authority over you; and I mu&s;t do him the Ju&s;tice to declare to you, that at our former publick Treaties, <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> never a&s;&s;umed any &s;uch Power, but on many Occa&s;ions, when he &s;poke of you, called you his Uncles and Superiors.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="008157_0016_102E3EBA149C4E60">
I never &s;hall attempt to nominate or impo&s;e a Chief on any Indian Tribe or Nation, but, on all Occa&s;ions, will pay due Regard to tho&s;e who are cho&s;en by their Country|men.</P>
<P>If any others have made <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> &s;o great a Man, as to &s;et him&s;elf above you, I am &s;orry for it. It is more than I know; and they who have done it, mu&s;t an&s;wer for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>I &s;hou'd be greatly concerned, that any Unea&s;ine&s;s &s;houd ari&s;e among you; and hope you will guard again&s;t it, and pre&s;erve that Harmony which ought to &s;ub&s;i&s;t between Friends and Relations.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>By this Belt and String, you promi&s;ed me, to make diligent Search in your Towns for our Fle&s;h and Blood, who are Pri&s;oners among you, and return them to us.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>We have always found you hone&s;t and punctual in the Performance of your Promi&s;es; your Words therefore give me great Comfort, and fill all our Hearts with Plea&s;ure. We rely upon you, that no Time may be lo&s;t in fulfilling an Engagement on which our Peace and Quiet &s;o greatly depend.</P></Q>
<P><HI>A Belt and String.</HI></P>
<P>Then Governor <HI>BERNARD</HI> &s;poke,</P>
<Q><P><HI>Brethren of all the confederated Nations,</HI></P>
<P>AS you propo&s;ed your Que&s;tions concerning <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> &s;eparately, I think it proper to give you a &s;eparate An&s;wer thereto.</P>
<P>I know not who made <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> &s;o great a Man; nor do I know that he is any greater than a Chief of the <HI>Delaware</HI> Indians &s;ettled at <HI>Wyomink.</HI> The Title of King cou'd not be given him by an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Governor; for we know very well, that there is no &s;uch Per&s;on among Indians, as what we call a King. And if we call him &s;o we mean no more than a <HI>Sachem,</HI> or Chief. I ob&s;erve in his Treaties which he has held with the Governor of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> [which I have peru&s;ed &s;ince our la&s;t Meeting] that he &s;ays he was a Woman, till you made him a Man, by putting a Tomhawk in his Hand; and thro' all of tho&s;e Treaties, e&s;pecially in the la&s;t, held at this Town, he calls you his Uncles, and profe&s;&s;es that he is dependent on you; and I know not that any Thing has &s;ince happened to alter his Relation to you. I therefore con&s;ider him to be &s;till your Nephew.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I am obliged to you for your kind Promi&s;es to return the Captives which have been taken from us. I hope you will not only do &s;o, but will al&s;o engage &s;uch of your Allies and Nephews, as have taken Captives from us, to do the &s;ame. That you may be mindful of this, I give you this Belt.</P></Q>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P>After the Governor had done &s;peaking, and their An&s;wers were interpreted in the United Nations and <HI>Delaware</HI> Languages, the Indian Chiefs were asked if they had any Thing more to &s;ay. On which <HI>Taga&s;hata</HI> aro&s;e, and made a Speech to his Cou&s;ins the <HI>Delaware</HI> and <HI>Mini&s;ink</HI> Indians, directing his Di&s;cour&s;e to <HI>Teedyu&s;cung.</HI></P>
<Q><P><HI>Nephews,</HI></P>
<P>YOU may remember all that pa&s;&s;ed at this Council Fire. The Governors who &s;it there have put you in Mind of what was agreed upon la&s;t Year: You both promi&s;ed to return the Pri&s;oners. We your Uncles, put you in Mind of this Promi&s;e, and de&s;ire you will perform it: You have promi&s;ed it, and mu&s;t perform it. We your Uncles, have promi&s;ed to return all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pri&s;oners among us, and therefore we expect that you our Cou&s;ins and Nephews will do the &s;ame. As &s;oon as you come home, we de&s;ire that you will &s;earch carefully in your Towns for all the Pri&s;oners among you that have been taken out of every Province, and cau&s;e them to be deliver'd up to your Brethren. You know that this is an Article of this Peace that was made between you and your Brethren: In Confirmation of which you received a large Peace Belt; of which Belt we de&s;ire you will give an Account, and let us know what is become of it, and how far you have proceeded in it.</P></Q>

<P><PB N="17" REF="008157_0017_102E3EBF0B185500">
After this was interpreted in the <HI>Delaware</HI> Language, it was ob&s;erved, that there were no <HI>Mini&s;ink</HI> Indians pre&s;ent; the Governors therefore de&s;ired, that Mr. <HI>Peters</HI> and Mr. <HI>Read</HI> would procure a Meeting of the Chiefs of the United Nations, <HI>Delawares</HI> and <HI>Mini&s;inks,</HI> and cau&s;e the Speech of <HI>Taga&s;hata</HI> to be interpreted to the <HI>Mini&s;inks</HI> in the Pre&s;ence of their Uncles.</P>
<P><HI>Robert White,</HI> the <HI>Nanticoke</HI> Chief, aro&s;e and &s;aid, he was going to &s;peak in Behalf of Seven Nations, and directing his Di&s;cour&s;e to the Governors, he delivered him&s;elf in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Language as follows,</P>
<Q><P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>It is now more than two Years &s;ince we heard of our Cou&s;ins the <HI>Delawares</HI> taking up the Hatchet again&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> At the fir&s;t, Sir <HI>William John&s;on</HI> &s;ent a Me&s;&s;age to the Head Nations, and when they received it, they &s;ent to us at <HI>Ot&s;aningo</HI>; telling us, that as we lived clo&s;e by our Cou&s;ins, they de&s;ired we wou'd invite them to meet at our Town, and accordingly we invited them, and they came to a great Meeting at our Town of <HI>Ot&s;aningo.</HI> We then gave our Cou&s;ins a Belt of a Fathom long, and Twenty-five Rows in Breadth, and de&s;ired them to lay down the Hatchet that they had taken up again&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and to be ea&s;y with them: And if they wou'd follow this Advice, we told them, that they wou'd live in Peace, untill their Heads were white with Age; otherwi&s;e, it might not be &s;o with them.</P>
<P>Not hearing from our Cou&s;ins for &s;ome Time, what they did in Con&s;equence of this Belt, we &s;ent to them two other Belts, one of Sixteen and the other of Twelve Rows, de&s;iring them once more to be ea&s;y with their Brethren the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and not to &s;trike them any more: But &s;till we heard nothing from them: Indeed &s;ome Time afterwards we under&s;tood the <HI>Delawares</HI> &s;hou'd &s;ay, that the Indians at <HI>Ot&s;aningo</HI> had grey Eyes, and were like the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and &s;hou'd be &s;erved as <HI>Engli&s;hm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI>; and we thought we &s;hou'd have had the Hatchet &s;truck into our Heads. We now want to know what is become of the&s;e Belts: May be they may be under Ground, or they have &s;wallowed them down their Throats.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>As our Cou&s;ins have been loath to give any An&s;wer to the&s;e Belts, we now de&s;ire they may let us know, in publick Conference, what they have done with them.</P></Q>

<HEAD>At a Conference held at <HI>Ea&s;ton</HI> the 18<HI>th October,</HI> 1758.</HEAD>
<P>PRESENT. The Governors, Council, Gentlemen and Indians, with the Interpreters: <HI>As afore&s;aid.</HI></P>
<P>MR. <HI>Peters</HI> and Mr. <HI>Read</HI> acquainted the Governors, <Q>That at a Meeting of the Chiefs of the older and younger Nations, with the &s;everal Tribes of the <HI>Delaware</HI> and <HI>Mini&s;ink</HI> Indians, on Monday Night, the Speech of <HI>Taga&s;hata,</HI> delivered that Morning in the publick Conference, re&s;pecting the giving up the Pri&s;oners, was interpreted in the <HI>Delaware</HI> Language by <HI>Stephen Calvin</HI>; and another Belt, on the Part of the Governors, being joined to <HI>Taga&s;hata's</HI> Belt, they were both deliver'd to the <HI>Delaware</HI> and <HI>Mini&s;ink</HI> Chiefs, to enforce the &s;ubject Matter. When this was done, <HI>Taga&s;hata</HI> &s;poke to the <HI>Mini&s;ink</HI> Chief <HI>Egotchowen,</HI> &s;aying, we were told by you, that you had delivered up the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pri&s;oners, and we believed you; but our Brethren have told us, that they were not delivered up, and therefore we earne&s;tly de&s;ire that they may be made ea&s;y on this Article. You know; Cou&s;ins, that their Hearts will always be in Grief, till they &s;ee again their Fle&s;h and Blood: It is natural that they &s;hou'd be &s;o: It wou'd be &s;o with us, if it was our Ca&s;e. We de&s;ire you will be <PB N="18" REF="008157_0018_102E3EC2ABE73260">extreamly careful to perform this Matter fully and &s;oon. Let there be perfect Peace over all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Country. And let it now be publi&s;hed, that we may all live in Peace, and with Satisfaction, now and for ever. I told you, <HI>Egotchowen,</HI> when you was in my Town, to bring with you the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pri&s;oners, and that our Brethren wou'd expect it. I wi&s;h you had done it. But however, do it now with all Speed, and it will be well.</Q></P>
<P>That <HI>Egotchowen</HI> an&s;wered, It is true, <Q>I was at my Uncles Fire, and I believe he de&s;ired me to bring the Pri&s;oners down; but I &s;uppo&s;e it was not interpreted to me; for I did not under&s;tand it clearly; but I now under&s;tand it.</Q></P>
<Q><P>That the <HI>Mini&s;ink</HI> and <HI>Delaware</HI> Indians were de&s;ired to collect all their Warriors together, and give them their Belts, and receive from them their An&s;wer, it being nece&s;&s;ary they &s;hou'd concur heartily in whatever &s;hou'd be concluded.</P></Q>
<P>Then <HI>Nichas,</HI> the <HI>Mohawk</HI> Chief acquainted the Governors, <Q>That, as Coun&s;ellors, they had fini&s;hed, having Nothing to propo&s;e at this pre&s;ent Meeting. The Warriors were to &s;peak now, and <HI>Thomas King</HI> was appointed to deliver their Words;</Q> who there|upon aro&s;e, and began <Q>with an Exhortation as well to all concerned in publick Affairs, Governors and their Councils, and Indian Chiefs and their Councils as to the Warriors of all Nations, White People and Indians, de&s;iring all pre&s;ent to attend carefully to what was going to be related, as Matters of great Con&s;equence, which wou'd &s;erve to regulate the Conduct of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> to each other. He added, that the Relation going to be made had taken a great deal of Trouble to put it into Order, and it was made on Infor|mation given by the &s;everal Indians now pre&s;ent, who were acquainted with the Facts.</Q></P>
<Q><P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>WE the Warriors have waited &s;ome Time, in Hopes our Coun&s;ellors wou'd have taken this Matter in Hand; but as they have not done it, we have, at their De&s;ire, undertaken it, and they have approved of every Thing. I &s;ay, the Coun&s;ellors of the five younger Nations, as well as the three older Nations, have approved of what the Warriors are going to relate; and take Notice that the Speech is not only the Speech of all the Warriors of the elder and younger Nations, but of our Cou&s;ins the <HI>Delawares</HI> and <HI>Mini&s;inks.</HI></P></Q>
<P>This was interpreted in the <HI>Delaware</HI> Language; and <HI>Thomas King</HI> then proceeded, directing his Speech to the Governors, and all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> upon the Continent.</P>
<Q><P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>YOU have been inqui&s;itive to know the Cau&s;e of this War; You have often enquired among us, but perhaps you did not find out the true Cau&s;e of the Bitterne&s;s of our Hearts, and may charge us wrongfully, and think that you were &s;truck without a Cau&s;e, by &s;ome of our own Warriors, and by our Cou&s;ins. But if you look a little about you, you will find, that you gave the fir&s;t Offence. For in Time of profound Peace, &s;ome of the <HI>Shawane&s;e,</HI> pa&s;&s;ing thro' <HI>South-Carolina</HI> to go to War with their Enemies, were taken up and put into Pri&s;on. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> knew they were going to War, and that they u&s;ed to do it every Year: And yet, after they had per&s;uaded them in a friendly Way into their Hou&s;es, they were taken up, and put into Pri&s;on; and one who was a head Man of that Nation lo&s;t his Life, and the others were &s;everely u&s;ed. This fir&s;t rai&s;ed Ill-will in the Minds of the <HI>Shawane&s;e,</HI> and as the <HI>French</HI> came a little after this happened to &s;ettle on the <HI>Ohio,</HI> the <HI>Shawane&s;e</HI> complained of it to them, and they made an artful U&s;e of it, &s;et them again&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and gave them the Hatchet. Being re&s;olved on Revenge, they accepted it, and likewi&s;e &s;poke to their Grand-Fathers the <HI>Delawares,</HI> &s;aying, Grand-Fathers, are not your Hearts &s;ore at our being u&s;ed &s;o ill, and at the Lo&s;s of one of our Chiefs? Will not you join us in revenging his Death? So by Degrees our young Men were brought over to act again&s;t you. On &s;earching Matters to the Bottom, you will find, that you in this Manner, gave the fir&s;t Offence. This we thought proper to let you know: It may be of Service for the future. You

may be induced by this, to take better Care in conducting your Council-Bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;o as to guard again&s;t the&s;e Breaches of Friend&s;hip, or as &s;oon as they happen, in corre&s;ponding immediately with one another, and with the Indian Nations, who are in any wi&s;e concerned on &s;uch Occa&s;ion.</P></Q>
<P><HI>Eight Strings of black Wampum.</HI></P>
<Q><P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>This was the Ca&s;e of the <HI>Shawane&s;e</HI> that I have ju&s;t now related. Another of the like Nature has &s;ince happened to the <HI>Senecas,</HI> who have &s;uffer'd in the &s;ame Manner.</P>
<P>About Three Years ago, eight <HI>Seneca</HI> Warriors were returning from War thro' <HI>Virginia,</HI> having &s;even Pri&s;oners and Scalps with them. At a Place called <HI>Green Briar,</HI> they met with a Party of Soldiers, not le&s;s than one Hundred and Fifty, who kindly invited them to come to a certain Store, and &s;aid they wou'd &s;upply them with Provi&s;ions: And ac|cordingly they travelled two Days with them, in a friendly Manner; and when they came to the Hou&s;e, they took their Arms from the <HI>Senecas</HI>: The head Man cried out, Here is Death, defend your&s;elves as well as you can;?? which they did, and Two of them were killed on the Spot; and one, a young Boy, was taken Pri&s;oner. This gave great Offence, and the more &s;o, as it was upon their Warriors Road, and we were in perfect Peace with our Brethren. It provoked us to &s;uch a Degree that we cou'd not get over it.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>You have ju&s;tly demanded your Pri&s;oners; it is right; and we have given you an An&s;wer: And therefore, as we think this young Boy is alive, and &s;omewhere among you, we de&s;ire you will enquire for him. If he be alive, return him; if you have &s;wallow'd him down your Throats, which perhaps may be the Ca&s;e, let us know it, and we will be content. His Name is <HI>Squi&s;&s;atego.</HI></P></Q>

<Q><P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>We have one Word more to mention of the &s;ame Nature, and which was the very Cau&s;e why the Indians at <HI>Ohio</HI> left you.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>When we fir&s;t heard of the <HI>French</HI> coming to <HI>Ohio,</HI> we immediately &s;ent Word to the Governors of <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI>; we de&s;ired them to come, and likewi&s;e to &s;upply us with &s;uch Things as were proper for War, intending to defend our Lands, and hinder the <HI>French</HI> from taking the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them: But the&s;e Governors did not attend to our Me&s;&s;age; perhaps they thought there was no Foundation for our In|telligence. The <HI>French,</HI> however came, and become our Neighbours; and you neither coming your&s;elves, nor a&s;&s;i&s;ting us with warlike Stores, our People of Nece&s;&s;ity were obliged to trade with them for what we wanted, as your Traders had left the Country. The Governor of <HI>Virginia</HI> took Care to &s;ettle on our Lands for his own Benefit; but when we wanted his A&s;&s;i&s;tance again&s;t the <HI>French,</HI> he di&s;regarded us.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>At this Treaty you ju&s;tly demanded to &s;ee your Fle&s;h and Blood. We have pre&s;&s;ed this on our Cou&s;ins the <HI>Mini&s;inks</HI>; and they by this String, de&s;ired us to a&s;&s;ure you, the Governors, that they wou'd make &s;trict Search in their Towns, and &s;incerely comply with your Reque&s;t, and return all the Pri&s;oners in their Power.</P></Q>
<P><HI>Two Strings of black and white Wampum.</HI></P>
<P>Then directing his Di&s;cour&s;e to the Governor of <HI>Jer&s;ey,</HI> he proceeded,</P>
<Q><P><HI>Brother, the Governor of</HI> Jer&s;ey.</P>
<P>Our Cou&s;ins the <HI>Mini&s;inks,</HI> tell us, they were wronged out of a great deal of Land, and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;ettling &s;o fa&s;t, they were pu&s;hed back, and cou'd not tell what Lands belonged to them. They &s;ay, if we have been drunk, tell us &s;o: We may have forgot what we &s;old; but we tru&s;t to you, the Governor of <HI>Jer&s;ey,</HI> to take our Cau&s;e in Hand, and &s;ee that we have Ju&s;tice done us. We &s;ay, that we have here and there Tracts of Land, that have never been &s;old. You deal hardly with us; you claim all the wild Creatures, and will not let us come on your Land to hunt after them. You will not <PB N="20" REF="008157_0020_102E3EC5B892B638">&s;o much as let us peel a &s;ingle Tree: This is hard, and has given us great Offence. The Cattle you rai&s;e are your own, but tho&s;e which are wild, are &s;till ours, or &s;hou'd be common to both; for when we &s;old the Land, we did not propo&s;e to deprive our&s;elves of hunting the wild Deer, or u&s;ing a Stick of Wood when we &s;hou'd have Occa&s;ion. We de&s;ire the Governor to take this Matter into his Care, and &s;ee that Ju&s;tice be done in it.</P>
<P><HI>Two Strings of white Wampum.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>All that has been &s;aid has been of one Nature, that is of Matters that are Subjects of Di&s;pute; this that I am now going to &s;peak upon, is of another Nature.</P></Q>
<P>Then directing him&s;elf to the Governor of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> he &s;aid:</P>
<Q><P>We mu&s;t put you in Mind, that four Years ago, you bought at <HI>Albany,</HI> a large Tract of Land over <HI>Su&s;quehannah,</HI> extending from the Mouth of <HI>John Penn</HI>'s Creek to the <HI>Ohio</HI>: The Proprietors Agents then paid One Thou&s;and Pieces of Eight for that Part which was &s;ettled by your People, that have been &s;ince driven off and killed. We acknowledge to have received Payment for tho&s;e Parts that were &s;ettled: But for the other Part that we have not received Payment for, that we reclaim. Our Warriors and Hunters, when they heard that we had &s;old &s;uch a large Tract, di&s;approved our Conduct in Council; &s;o now we acquaint you, that we are determined not to confirm any more than &s;uch of the Lands as the Con&s;ideration was paid for, and were then &s;ettled, though the others were included in the Deed; they are our hunting Grounds, and we de&s;ire this Reque&s;t may be granted, and Notice taken, that it was made in open Conference.</P></Q>
<P><HI>Three white Strings.</HI></P>
<P>Then <HI>Thomas King</HI> &s;at down.</P>
<P>The Confederate Chiefs, being a&s;ked if they had any Thing to &s;ay, an&s;wer'd, <Q>That they had done; and having ea&s;ed their Minds of all that lay heavy upon them, they wou'd return Home.</Q></P>
<P>The Governors promi&s;ed attentively to con&s;ider what was &s;aid, and give them an An&s;wer.</P>
<P><HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> then aro&s;e and &s;poke.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<Q><P>I SHOU'D have &s;aid &s;omething at the Time our Uncles laid before you their Grievances, or Cau&s;es of Complaint, in Behalf of my Countrymen, who lived near <HI>Go&s;hen.</HI> About three Years ago, nine of their People were killed at <HI>Go&s;hen,</HI> when they were in Peace. I will not take upon me to &s;ay, that the Land had never been &s;old; but there was no Di&s;pute about this at that Time: I verily believe, that they killed tho&s;e nine Indians for no other Rea&s;on, than becau&s;e they were hunting on that Land. I &s;peak to all the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> when I mention this, as what was very wrong.</P></Q>
<P><HI>Three white Strings.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<Q><P>One of the <HI>Waping</HI> Tribes, or <HI>Go&s;hen</HI> Indians, tells me, that, as &s;oon as tho&s;e nine Men were killed, he went with Three Belts and Tears in his Eyes, to <HI>George Vreeland,</HI> in order to have the Matter made up: But he never received any An&s;wer to this Day, though he told him, he wou'd &s;end the Belts to the Governor; and as &s;oon as he &s;hou'd receive his An&s;wer, he wou'd &s;end for him, and let him know. But he had never yet received any An&s;wer.</P></Q>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<Q><P>I give you this String, to enquire what became of the three Belts, and what An&s;wer was made to them.</P>
<P><HI>Three Strings of white Wampum.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>You may remember we made Peace la&s;t Year, and a Peace Belt was made a Fathom long, and of Fifteen Rows; Mr. <HI>Croghan</HI> was pre&s;ent, &s;o were &s;ome of my Uncles, and the <HI>Mini&s;inks</HI>; they all &s;aw it. You have a&s;ked me, what is become of that Belt, and <PB N="21" REF="008157_0021_102E3EC840B51378">how far it went. I will tell you: I &s;ent it up the <HI>Su&s;quebannah</HI> to <HI>Diabogo</HI>; from thence it went to <HI>A&s;&s;intzin</HI>; thence to <HI>Secaughkung.</HI> The chief Men there got together, to con&s;ider what was be&s;t to be done with it: They all concluded, that it &s;hou'd be &s;ent to our Uncle: He is a Man, and often told us, he ought to &s;ee Things fir&s;t, and con&s;ider what is to be done. The <HI>Senecas</HI> had the Belt fir&s;t; and then all the United Nations afterwards; they had it almo&s;t a Year. Now it is come back, and is in <HI>Lapachpeton</HI>'s Hand, who is one of the <HI>Delawares,</HI> and lives at <HI>Secaughkung.</HI> How far the Peace Belt went, I don't know; but I &s;uppo&s;e it went through all my Uncles: And I a&s;&s;ure you, I will do as my Uncle does. He has promi&s;ed you, he will deliver up all your Captives; and I a&s;&s;ure you, I will do &s;o, where&s;oever I find them, in all my Towns. Four Tribes, <HI>now pre&s;ent,</HI> have agreed to this, <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>Delawares, Unamies, Mohiccons</HI> and <HI>Wapings,</HI> who are &s;ettled as far as <HI>Secaughkung,</HI> This Belt confirms my Words.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother, the Governor of</HI> Penn&s;ylvania,</P>
<P>I did let you know formerly what my Grievance was. I told you, that from <HI>Tobiccon</HI> as far as the <HI>Delawares</HI> owned, the Proprietors had wronged me. Then you and I agreed, that it &s;hould be laid before the King of <HI>England:</HI> For you &s;aid he was our Father, and he &s;hou'd &s;ee what were our Differences; for, as you and I cou'd not decide it, he &s;hould do it. Let us not alter what you and I have agreed: And now, let me know, if King GEORGE has decided the Matter between you and me. I don't pretend to mention any of my Uncles Lands, I only mention what we, the <HI>Delawares,</HI> own as far as the Heads of <HI>Delaware.</HI> All the Lands lying on the Waters that fall into the <HI>Su&s;quebannah</HI> belong to our Uncles.</P></Q>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> then took up another Belt, de&s;igning to &s;peak to his Uncles the United Nations, but whil&s;t he was delivering the above, their Chiefs had one after another left the Council, &s;eeming much di&s;plea&s;ed: He therefore declined &s;peaking it.</P>

<P>The Governors being ready to give their An&s;wers, de&s;ired the Indians to meet; but they continued holding private Councils among them&s;elves all that Day, till late in the Afternoon: And, as the Governors were going to the Place of Conference, the Indians &s;ent Mr. <HI>Wei&s;er</HI> out of Council, to de&s;ire they wou'd defer meeting till the next Morning, their own private Bu&s;ine&s;s not being fini&s;hed.</P>

<P><PB N="23" REF="008157_0023_102E3ECE40FECE78">
<HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>The Proprietors of this Province, have on all Occa&s;ions manife&s;ted their par|ticular Regard for you: They prefer your Friend&s;hip and the publick Good to their own private Intere&s;t. Their former Conduct gives you no Room to doubt the Truth of this; what I am about to tell you is a further Confirmation of it: therefore give me your Attention, and li&s;ten to what I &s;hall &s;ay. You may remem|ber, that, at a Treaty you held with your good Friend Sir <HI>William John&s;on,</HI> three Years ago, &s;ome of your wi&s;e Men told him, that there were &s;ome among them who were di&s;&s;atisfied with the Sale of the above Lands, made by them at <HI>Albany,</HI> and were de&s;irous that Part of it &s;hould be re&s;erved for them; tho' the Proprie|tors had purcha&s;ed it fairly of them, and paid One Thou&s;and Pieces of Eight; which was all they were to receive, till our People &s;ettled to the We&s;tward of the <HI>Allegheny,</HI> or <HI>Apalachian</HI> Hills. Sir <HI>William John&s;on</HI> repre&s;ented this Matter to the Proprietors, in your Behalf: Whereupon they chearfully agreed to relea&s;e to you all that Part of the Purcha&s;e you have reclaimed, and by a Letter of Attorney, empowered <HI>Richard Peters</HI> and <HI>Conrad Wei&s;er,</HI> to execute a Deed to you for tho&s;e Lands, on your confirming to them the Re&s;idue of that Purcha&s;e. On this Sub|ject therefore you will plea&s;e to confer with them, and &s;ettle the Boundaries be|tween you, that they may relea&s;e the Lands to you accordingly, before you leave this Place, and &s;et your Minds at Ea&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I thank you for the Pains you have taken with your Nephews, to prevail with them, to return us &s;uch of our Brethren as are Pri&s;oners among them; and we depend on the &s;peedy Performance of their Promi&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I have &s;omething to &s;ay to you, which is of the utmo&s;t Importance to us all; it requires your particular Attention and Con&s;ideration. Providence has brought you and your Nephews together at this Meeting, Face to Face with us, that eve|ry Thing may be &s;ettled, and nothing remain, not &s;o much as a Doubt, to cre|ate any Unea&s;ine&s;s in our Hearts hereafter. You know, Brethren, that there is an old Agreement between the Proprietors and you, that you will not &s;ell any of the Lands lying within this Province to any one but them; and they never take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Lands till they have bought them of the <HI>Indians.</HI> You know al&s;o, that the United Nations have &s;old Lands to the Proprietors, which your Nephews the <HI>Delawares</HI> now claim as their Right. This is the Ca&s;e with regard to &s;ome Part of the Lands lying between <HI>Tobiccon</HI> Creek and the Head of <HI>Delaware</HI> River, which <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> it your Hearing the Day before Ye&s;terday, &s;aid the Proprietors had de|frauded him of. The Proprietors are de&s;irous to do &s;trict Ju&s;tice to all the Indi|ans; but it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed they can know in which of you the Right was ve&s;ted. It is a Matter that mu&s;t be &s;ettled among your&s;elves; till this is done, there will probably remain &s;ome Jealou&s;ly and Di&s;content among you, that may inter|rupt both your and our future Quiet, which we &s;hou'd guard again&s;t by all Means in our Power.</P>

And we can a&s;&s;ure you, that as a tender Father over all his Children, he will forgive what is pa&s;t, and receive you again into his Arms.</P>

<HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>If you are in E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ne&s;t to be reconciled to us, you will keep your young Men from attacking our Country, and killing, and carrying Captive our back Inhabitants; and will likewi&s;e give Orders, that your People may be kept at a Di&s;tance from Fort <HI>Duque&s;ne,</HI> that they may not be hurt by our Warriors, who are &s;ent by our King, to cha&s;ti&s;e the <HI>French,</HI> and not to hurt you. Con&s;ider the command|ing Officer of that Army treads heavy, and would be very &s;orry to hurt any of his Indian Brethren.</P>
<P><HI>A large Belt.</HI></P>
<P>And, <HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>The Chiefs of the United Nations, with their Cou&s;ins, our Brethren the <HI>Dela|wares</HI> and others now here, jointly with me, &s;end this Belt, which has upon it two Figures, that repre&s;ent all the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and all the Indians now pre&s;ent, taking Hands and delivering it to <HI>Pi&s;quetomen</HI>; and we de&s;ire it may be likewi&s;e &s;ent to the Indians who are named at the End of the&s;e Me&s;&s;ages; as they have all been formerly our very good Friends and Allies; and we de&s;ire, they will all go from among the <HI>French</HI> to their own Towns, and no longer help the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>If you take the Belts we ju&s;t now gave you, in which all here join, <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and Indians, as we don't doubt you will; then, by this Belt, I make a Road for you, and invite you to come to <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> to your fir&s;t old Council Fire, which was kindled when we fir&s;t &s;aw one another; which Fire we will kindle up again, and remove all Di&s;putes, and renew the old and fir&s;t Treaties of Friend&s;hip. There is a clear and open Road for you; fear therefore Nothing, and come to us, with as many as can be of the <HI>Delawares, Shawane&s;e,</HI> or of the Six Nation Indians. We will be glad to &s;ee you; we de&s;ire all Tribes and Nations of Indians, who are in Alliance with you, may come. As &s;oon as we hear of your coming, of which we de&s;ire you will give us timely Notice, we will lay up Provi&s;ions for you along the Road.</P>
<P><HI>A large white Belt, with the Figure of a Man at each End, and Streaks of Black, repre&s;enting the Road from the</HI> Ohio <HI>to</HI> Philadelphia.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>The Six Nation and <HI>Delaware</HI> Chiefs, join with me in tho&s;e Belts, which are tied together, to &s;ignify our Union and Friend&s;hip for each other; with them we jointly take the Tomhawk out of your Heads, and bury them under Ground.</P>
<P>We &s;peak loud, &s;o as you may hear us; you &s;ee we all &s;tand together joined Hand in Hand.</P></Q>
<P><HI>Two Belts tied together.</HI></P>
<P>The Indian Chiefs being a&s;ked, if it would not be proper to in&s;ert in the Me&s;|&s;age, an Account of the Situation of our Army to the We&s;tward, and de&s;ire them to join General FORBES again&s;t the <HI>French,</HI> replied, that they would by no Means advi&s;e this Government &s;o &s;oon to pre&s;s them to take up the Hatchet, becau&s;e their Wounds were not yet healed, nor Peace made, which mu&s;t fir&s;t be done. They &s;aid further, that as the <HI>French</HI> had many Indians fighting for them, and they by Intermarriages were related to the Indians who &s;ent the Me&s;&s;ages, it could not be expected they would ea&s;ily be per&s;uaded to join the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> le&s;t they &s;hould kill their own Fle&s;h and Blood; adding, that the only proper Mea&s;ure, that could now be taken, was to advi&s;e them to &s;it &s;till and keep out of the Way: And this Ad|vice they believed would be hearkened to.</P>
<P>They then de&s;ired, that, at lea&s;t two of our Inhabitants might accompany <HI>Pi&s;quetomen,</HI> and <HI>Thomas Hickman,</HI> the two Me&s;&s;engers to the <HI>Ohio.</HI> The Confederate Chiefs pro|mi&s;ed to &s;end two of their own People with them, and <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> &s;aid he would &s;end one, if not two <HI>Delawares.</HI></P>

</LIST></P>
<P>His Excellency informed them, that he met them to agree about a Con&s;ideration for the uncertain Claims of the <HI>Mini&s;inks, Wapings</HI> and other Indians, Claimants of Land in the Northern Parts of the Province of <HI>New-Jer&s;ey,</HI> and de&s;ired that it might be con&s;idered, that they knew not what they &s;old, and he knew not what he bought; therefore the Price ought not to be large.</P>
<P>That they might propo&s;e a Sum to him, or he would make an Offer to them; or it &s;hould be left to their Uncles to con&s;ider of a Price, as would plea&s;e them be&s;t.</P>
<P>The United Nations, by <HI>Thomas King,</HI> &s;aid, that they had no Claim to the Lands of the <HI>Mini&s;inks,</HI> or others their Nephews, on the Ea&s;t Side of <HI>Delaware,</HI> and &s;hould therefore leave the fixing a Price to them.</P>
<P>Then the <HI>Mini&s;inks</HI> and <HI>Wapings</HI> withdrew to con&s;ult upon it, and being returned, <HI>Egobobowen,</HI> the <HI>Mini&s;ink</HI> Chief, &s;aid, they would choo&s;e the Governor &s;hould make an Offer, as they might perhaps demand too much.</P>
<P>His Excellency having con&s;ulted the Commi&s;&s;ioners, offered them Eight Hun|dred Spani&s;h Dollars for their Claim in <HI>New-Jer&s;ey,</HI> as an extraordinary Price.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mini&s;inks</HI> &s;aid, they &s;hould be glad of the Opinion of their Uncles in the Matter.</P>
<P>The United Nations, by <HI>Thomas King,</HI> &s;aid, it was a fair and honourable Offer, and that, if it was their own Ca&s;e, they would chearfully accept of it: But, as there were a great many Per&s;ons to &s;hare in the Purcha&s;e Money, they recommended it to his Excellency, to add two Hundred Dollars more; and, if that was complied with, the Report of it would be carried to all the Nations, and would be a great Proof of the Affection and Genero&s;ity of their Brethren the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> on this Oc|ca&s;ion, and would be very agreeable to them.</P>
<P>His Excellency de&s;ired to know of the <HI>Mini&s;inks,</HI> and other Claimants, if they approved of the Propo&s;al of their Uncles; and they informed him, that they did.</P>
<P>The Governor after con&s;ulting the Commi&s;&s;ioners, &s;aid, it was more than he had intended to give; but as the United Nations had given them&s;elves the Trouble of being Mediators between them, he could not refu&s;e their Recommendations, and was glad of the Opportunity he had of &s;hewing his Regard to the United Nations, and his Benevolence to the <HI>Mini&s;ink</HI> and other Indians, who had re&s;ided in the Province where he pre&s;ided, and therefore complied with their Reque&s;t.</P>
<P>His Excellency then de&s;ired them to remember, that this Con&s;ideration Money, was to be in full for the Claims of all the <HI>Mini&s;ink</HI> and <HI>Waping</HI> Indians, and all others who claim any Lands, in a Map, which was laid before them at the &s;ame Time, which <PB N="27" REF="008157_0027_102E3ED97A3D7450">included all the Lands from the Line between the Provinces of <HI>New-York</HI> and <HI>New-Jer&s;ey,</HI> and down <HI>Hud&s;on</HI>'s River, to the Mouth of <HI>Rariton</HI> up the &s;ame to <HI>Ala|metung</HI> Falls, on the North Branch of <HI>Rariton</HI> River, thence on a &s;treight Line to <HI>Paoqualin</HI> Mountain, where it joins on <HI>Delaware</HI> River, and thence up the <HI>Delaware</HI> to <HI>Cu&s;bytunk</HI>; and recommended it to them to have Re&s;pect to this in the Divi|&s;ion of the Con&s;ideration Money.</P>
<P>Then <HI>Taga&s;hata,</HI> the <HI>Seneca</HI> Chief, aro&s;e, and addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the <HI>Mini&s;inks</HI> and other Indian Claimants, &s;poke as follows.</P>
<Q><P>My <HI>Nephews,</HI></P>
<P>I de&s;ire you will now give over all Thoughts of your Land, and that we may hear no more Complaints about it.</P>
<P>Now you mu&s;t remember the Friend&s;hip between you and your Brother, and tran|&s;mit to your Children, and make them acquainted with the Tran&s;actions of this Day. I recommend this to you, not from my Lips only, but from the Bottom of my Heart: I hope it will al&s;o make a deep Impre&s;&s;ion in your Hearts.</P>
<P>It &s;eems, as if your Grandfathers had not told you of the Treaties they u&s;ed to have with their Brethren, but carried them with them to the Grave. But we hope you will not do &s;o, but carefully inform your Children of your Agreements. We have given you this Advice, and hope you will follow it. We al&s;o expect you will take Care of your young Men, that they do no more Mi&s;chief to their Bre|thren the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P></Q>
<P><HI>Egohohowen,</HI> then addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the Governor, and de&s;ired to be heard.</P>
<Q><P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>We are now thoroughly &s;atisfied, and we &s;till retain a Friend&s;hip for our Bre|thren the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and we de&s;ire, that if we &s;hould come into your Province, to &s;ee our old Friends, and &s;hould have Occa&s;ion for the Bark of a Tree to cover a Cabbin, or a little Refre&s;hment, that we &s;hould not be denied, but be treated as Brethren: And that your People may not look on the wild Bea&s;ts of the Fore&s;t, or Fi&s;h of the Waters, as their &s;ole Property; but that we may be admitted to an equal U&s;e of them.</P></Q>
<P>The Governor an&s;wered, that, as &s;oon as he got Home, he &s;hould i&s;&s;ue a Proclama|tion, to notify to the People of his Province, that he had made a Peace with them, and to order, that, for the Future, they &s;hould be treated as Brethren, which he hoped would be done: But de&s;ired they would not go into tho&s;e Parts, where they had lately committed Ho&s;tilities, till the People's Pa&s;&s;ions were cooled; for he could not be an&s;werable for his People's Behaviour, whil&s;t their Lo&s;&s;es were fre&s;h upon their Minds.</P>

<Q><P><HI>Uncles,</HI></P>
<P>I de&s;ire you will hear me. We have gone &s;o far at this Treaty, as to talk of Lands, I therefore thought proper to meet you here, to let you know, that I have con&s;ulted with all my Brethren, your Cou&s;ins here pre&s;ent, about the Deed you, our Uncles, &s;igned to the Proprietors of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> &s;hewn to us Ye&s;terday, for the Lands beyond the <HI>Kittachtinny</HI> Hills.</P>
<P>We have &s;een the Deed, and know it well. <HI>Nutimus,</HI> one of our chief Men has &s;igned it, and here &s;its one of our Men, named <HI>Philip Compa&s;s,</HI> who was pre|&s;ent when the Sale was made, and remembers, that <HI>Nutimus</HI> our Chief received Forty-four Dollars, as his Part or Share of the Con&s;ideration Money. We agree to it, and acknowledge the Land was fairly &s;old. We give it up, and now con|firm it, that there may be no Difference, nor any Thing more &s;aid about it. This is not the Land I have di&s;puted with my Brethren the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> That Land lies between <HI>Tohiccon</HI> Creek and the <HI>Kittachtinny</HI> Hills.</P></Q>
<P><HI>Gave a String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tokaaio,</HI> the <HI>Cayuga</HI> Chief, &s;tood up and &s;poke as follows, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to <HI>Teedyu&s;cung.</HI></P>
<Q><P><HI>Cou&s;in,</HI></P>
<P>I thank you for your Opene&s;s and Hone&s;ty on this Occa&s;ion, freely to de|clare the Truth. We wi&s;h our Brethren the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> naming the Governors of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania, Virginia, Carolina</HI> and <HI>Jer&s;ey,</HI> were &s;o plain and preci&s;e. They have called us down to this Council Fire, which was kindled for Council Affairs, to renew Treaties of Friend&s;hip, and brighten the Chain of Friend&s;hip. But here we mu&s;t hear a Di&s;pute about Land, and our Time is taken up from Day to Day; but they do not come to the chief Point.</P>
<P>The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> fir&s;t began to do Mi&s;chief; we told them &s;o: They only thanked us for our Openne&s;s and Advice, and &s;aid they would take Care for the Future, but healed no Wounds. In &s;hort, when they &s;peak to us, they do it with a &s;horter Belt or String, than that which we &s;peak to them with; tho' they can make Wampum, and we cannot.</P>
<P>They ought not thus to treat with Indians on Council Affairs. Several of our Strings and Belts are lo&s;t in their Hands entirely. I fear they only &s;peak from their Mouth, and not from their Heart.</P></Q>
<P>On the &s;ame Day, P. M. <HI>Pi&s;quetomen</HI> and <HI>Thomas Hickman</HI> came to take their Leave of the Governor, accompanied with Captain <HI>Bull,</HI> jun. <HI>William Hayes,</HI> and <HI>I&s;aac Stille,</HI> the Per&s;ons appointed to attend them to the <HI>Ohio,</HI> who were particu|larly recommended to their Care and Protection, by a String of Wampum.</P>
<P>The Belts and Strings were numbered, as well in the written Paper containing the Me&s;&s;ages, as on Labels tied to each of them, and delivered to <HI>Pi&s;quetomen,</HI> and the written Me&s;&s;age was delivered with the Pa&s;&s;ports to Captain <HI>Bull.</HI></P>

<P>As they were &s;etting out, Mr. <HI>Frederick Po&s;t</HI> arrived with News from General <HI>Forbes,</HI> that a large Body of <HI>French</HI> and Indians, having attacked his advanced Po&s;t at <HI>Lloyal-Hanning,</HI> were repul&s;ed with great Lo&s;s on their Side; which News was communicated to the Indians.</P>

<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>Now we have healed your Wounds, we, by this Belt, renew all our Treaties; we brighten the Chain of Friend&s;hip; we return to our fir&s;t Affection; we confirm our antient Union; we put fre&s;h Earth to the Roots of the Tree of Peace, that it may bear up again&s;t every Storm that can blow, and live and flouri&s;h to the End of Time, whil&s;t the Sun &s;hines, and the Rivers run.

<P><HI>A large Peace Belt delivered by the two Governors to the confederate Chiefs, and by them banded round to all the Indians pre&s;ent.</HI></P>
<Q><P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>We now open a Road to the Old Council Fire, which was kindled by your and our Fathers in the City of <HI>Philadelphia:</HI> Be a&s;&s;ured, that you will always find this Road open, ea&s;y and plea&s;ant to travel in, and for the Future whenever Occa&s;ion calls, we &s;hall be glad to &s;ee you there.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren, of the United Nations, and all our other Brethren, your Cou&s;ins and Nephews.</HI></P>
<P>We thank you, for the Care and Diligence with which you have attended to the &s;everal Matters recommended to you in the&s;e Conferences, which have yielded us Abundance of Satisfaction. This Treaty will convince all our Enemies, that we are now united in the firme&s;t Band of Amity; and whil&s;t we join our Strength together, it will not be in their Power to hurt either you or us.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>As a Token of the Love we your Brethren of this Province bear you, I &s;hall make a Pre&s;ent of a Quantity of Goods, which we have prepared for you, and de&s;ire your Acceptance of them; &s;en&s;ible of the approaching Sea&s;on, and of the many Difficulties you live under, from the pre&s;ent War. We give them with an hearty good Will.</P></Q>
<P>Here his Honour delivered a Li&s;t of the Goods, and de&s;ired Mr. <HI>Wei&s;er</HI> and Mr. <HI>Montour</HI> wou'd interpret it to them at a proper Time.</P>
<P>Then <HI>Nichas,</HI> on the Behalf of the three elder Nations; <HI>Thomas King,</HI> on the Behalf of the five younger Nations, and <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> on the Behalf of the other Nations, gave the <HI>Yohan,</HI> and <HI>Conrad Wei&s;er</HI> returned it twice on the Behalf of the Governors: After which Governor DENNY &s;aid,</P>
<P><HI>Brother Teedyu&s;cung,</HI></P>
<Q><P>BY this Belt you put me in Mind, that we formerly referred our Di&s;pute about Lands to our Father King GEORGE, and you de&s;ired to know if he has decided it.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="008157_0030_102E3EDF57FD9DE8">
<HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>You &s;hou'd con&s;ider the Circum&s;tances of the Affairs of your Father King GEORGE: His Maje&s;ty lives at a very great Di&s;tance from us, is now engaged in a War with the <HI>French</HI>; and the Bu&s;ine&s;s of War takes up a great deal of Time and Attention: Be&s;ides, in Time of War, we have but few Opportunities of hearing from him.</P>
<P>As yet I have had no An&s;wer relative to your Affairs. You may depend upon it, as &s;oon as I receive one, it &s;hall be communicated to you. And I can a&s;&s;ure you, the Proprietors have pre&s;&s;ed Di&s;patch, and will do every Thing they can, to bring it to a &s;peedy Determination.</P></Q>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P>Then Governor BERNARD, reque&s;ting the Attention of the Indians, addre&s;&s;ed them as follows,</P>
<Q><P><HI>Brethren, of the United Nations,</HI></P>
<P>BY this String, you &s;poke on Behalf of our Brethren the <HI>Mini&s;inks,</HI> and &s;aid, "That they were wronged in their Lands; that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;ettled &s;o fa&s;t, they were continually pu&s;hing them back; and when they a&s;ked for their Lands, they were told that they had &s;old their Lands, and had got drunk and forgot it. If they had &s;wallow'd their Lands, they mu&s;t be content; but they did not believe that they had &s;wallow'd all, but that &s;ome was left. They de&s;ired, that I wou'd enquire after their Lands that were left, and to them Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I am glad I have an Opportunity, in the Pre&s;ence of &s;o many Nations, to expre&s;s the De&s;ire I have of doing Ju&s;tice to every one. The Throne of the Great King is founded on Ju&s;tice: And I &s;hou'd not be a faithful Servant to him, if I neglected to give Redre&s;s to all Per&s;ons, that have received Injuries from the People, over whom the Great King has placed me.</P>
<P>I have therefore had a Conference with the <HI>Mini&s;inks,</HI> in the Pre&s;ence of &s;ome of their Uncles; and have come to a full Agreement with them, the Proceedings of which are now ready to be read to you.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I have another Proof to give you of the Uprightne&s;s and Ju&s;tice of our Province. We have come to an Agreement with the <HI>Delawares,</HI> and other Indians for the un|certain Claims they had on the Southern Parts of our Province. I hereby produce the Deeds, that have been executed on this Occa&s;ion, that the Subject of them may be explained to you, and be had in perpetual Remembrance by all the Nations pre&s;ent: And I de&s;ire, that you may all remember, that, by the&s;e two Agreements, the Province of <HI>New-Jer&s;ey</HI> is entirely freed and di&s;charged from all Indian Claims. In Confirma|tion of which, I give you this Belt.</P></Q>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother Teedyu&s;cung,</HI></P>
<Q><P>By this String you tell me, that, after the Killing the nine Indians near <HI>E&s;opus,</HI> you carried three Belts to <HI>George Vreeland,</HI> who undertook to give them to the Gover|nor, and you a&s;k what is become of tho&s;e Belts.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I can only &s;ay, that I never heard of tho&s;e Belts before; nor do I know what Governor <HI>George Vreeland</HI> undertook to carry tho&s;e Belts to. The proper Governor was the Governor of <HI>New-York</HI>; for in his Province was this Mi&s;chief committed. And probably the Governor of <HI>New-York</HI> had the&s;e Belts; for I have heard that be i&s;&s;ued a Proclamation for apprehending the Perpetrators of this Fact. This Fact has been blamed by all good and wi&s;e Men; and I am glad it was not done by the People of my Province. I will acquaint the Governor of <HI>New-York</HI> with what you have &s;aid upon this Occa&s;ion, and I will enquire after tho&s;e Belts, and give you an An&s;wer.</P></Q>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P>Governor DENNY, being obliged to return to <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> on urgent Bu&s;ine&s;s, took his Leave of the Indians, &s;aying.</P>
<Q><P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>IT gives me great Plea&s;ure that the Bu&s;ine&s;s of this Treaty has been carried on with &s;o much Satisfaction.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="008157_0031_102E3EE2D21B8B38">
I am &s;orry, I am now to inform you, that I am obliged to leave you, having received la&s;t Night an Expre&s;s from General <HI>Forbes,</HI> who is now near the <HI>Ohio.</HI> My Bu&s;ine&s;s calls me to Town; I &s;hall therefore leave Mr. <HI>Logan</HI> and Mr. <HI>Peters</HI> to tran&s;act the Remainder of the Bu&s;ine&s;s, and doubt not but they will act to your Satisfaction. I a&s;&s;ure you of my Affection for you, and wi&s;h you all Manner of Happine&s;s.</P></Q>
<P><HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> aro&s;e, and de&s;ired to be heard on Behalf of the <HI>Wapings,</HI> living near <HI>AE&s;epus,</HI> and produced a &s;hort broad Belt of white Wampum, having in the Center, two Hearts of a reddi&s;h Colour, and in Figures 1745, wrote after the following Manner, 17 &hearts; &hearts; 45. The Belt had a round Circle Pendant, repre&s;enting the Sun: He then produced two Certificates, One from Governor CLINTON, and the other from Governor HARDY, both which were much in Favour of the <HI>Waping</HI> Indians. He &s;aid the Belt was given them by the Government of <HI>New-York,</HI> and repre&s;ented their Union, which was to la&s;t as long as the Sun &s;hould continue in the Firmament.</P>
<P><HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> addre&s;&s;ed Governor BERNARD, de&s;iring by a String of Wampum, that he would extend his Protection to the <HI>Wapings</HI>; and as their Chief was old and infirm, he reque&s;ted the Favour of a Hor&s;e to carry him Home; which was readily granted.</P>
<P><HI>Taga&s;hata</HI> made the &s;ame Reque&s;t to Governor DENNY, which was likewi&s;e granted.</P>
<P>The Six Nation Chiefs con&s;ulted together, and in a little Time, <HI>Nichas,</HI> in their Behalf, returned an An&s;wer to the Speeches of the Governors, laying the Belts and Strings upon the Table, in the Order they were delivered, and repeating di&s;tinctly what was &s;aid on each of them. At the End of every Article he returned Thanks, and expre&s;&s;ed the highe&s;t Satisfaction, particularly on the ratifying the Peace, and the large Belt given thereupon, which he &s;aid &s;hould be &s;ent to all the di&s;tant Nations of Indians, to whom it would be very agreeable; he likewi&s;e promi&s;ed, that every Thing tran&s;acted in the&s;e Conferences, which he again &s;aid had afforded them great Plea&s;ure, &s;hould be laid before the great Council at <HI>Onondaga,</HI> who&s;e An&s;wers &s;hould be carefully tran&s;mitted.</P>
<P>He thanked Governor BERNARD for making up all the Differences between that Government and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Mini&s;ink</HI> Indians &s;o much to their Satisfaction.</P>
<P>He made an Apology for the Want of Wampum, and the Exchange of other Belts to give in Confirmation of their Performance of the &s;everal Things mentioned in the Governors Speeches, agreeable to Indian Cu&s;toms. And then wi&s;hed Gover|nor DENNY a good Journey.</P>

<P>His Excellency Governor BERNARD produced the following Deeds: One Deed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> executed by five Indian Attornies, appointed by a Council of the <HI>Delaware</HI> Nations, for all the Lands lying in <HI>New-Jer&s;ey,</HI> South of a Line from <HI>Paoqualin</HI> Mountains at <HI>Delaware</HI> River, to the falls of <HI>Alamatung,</HI> on the North Branch of <HI>Rariton</HI> River, thence down that River to <HI>Sandy-Hook</HI>; dated the 12th of <HI>September</HI> la&s;t, with Endor&s;ements thereon, made by <HI>Teedyu&s;cung, Unwal|licon</HI> and <HI>Tepa&s;cawen,</HI> &s;ignifying their Agreement thereto, and Acknowledgment of their having received Satisfaction thereon; Witne&s;&s;ed by three Chiefs of the Six Nations, who in Behalf of the Six Nations, approved the Sale, and al&s;o by &s;everal <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Witne&s;&s;es.

<P>Which being intepreted in the <HI>Mingo</HI> and <HI>Delaware</HI> Languages; His Excellency addre&s;&s;ed the Indians, as follows.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<Q><P>I AM very glad this good Work has been &s;o happily fini&s;hed. I came among you wholly unacquainted with your Forms, and therefore, if I have omitted any Ceremonies, you will readily excu&s;e me. But in whatever I have been deficient, I am &s;ure, I have not wanted a good Heart towards you.</P>
<P>The Circum&s;tances of our Province, have hitherto rendered us unable to give you any great Proofs of our Regard for you. But I &s;hall endeavour to per&s;uade my People, to do you good Service for the future, by opening a Communication with you; which if rightly managed, will be much to the Advantage of both People. And for my own Part, I &s;hall be always ready to do you Ju&s;tice; and de&s;ire that whenever you have Cau&s;e of Complaint again&s;t my People, you will take care to &s;ignify it to me.</P></Q>
<P>A String.</P>
<P>The Five Nation Chiefs, laid all the Belts and Strings on the Table, that were delivered at this and the la&s;t Conference. <HI>Tokaaio,</HI> the <HI>Cayuga</HI> Chief, de&s;ired the Governor and all pre&s;ent, would take Notice of what <HI>Thomas King</HI> was going to &s;ay, on Behalf of the United Nations.</P>
<P>On which <HI>Thomas King</HI> aro&s;e, and taking up the fir&s;t Belt which was given by <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> when he reque&s;ted a Deed for the <HI>Wioming</HI> Lands, he addre&s;&s;ed the <HI>Delawares,</HI> (<HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> not being pre&s;ent) as follows.</P>
<Q><PB N="34" REF="008157_0034_102E3EEC600EAA40">
<P><HI>Cou&s;ins,</HI></P>
<P>By this Belt, <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> de&s;ired us to make you the Owners of the Lands at <HI>Wioming, Shamokin</HI> and other Places on the <HI>Su&s;quehannah</HI> River; in An&s;wer to which, we who are pre&s;ent &s;ay, That we have no Power to convey Lands to any one, but we will take your Reque&s;t to the Great Council Fire, for their Sentiments, as we never &s;ell or convey any Land, till it be agreed on at the Great Council of the United Nations. In the mean Time, you may make u&s;e of the&s;e Lands, in Conjunction with our People, and all the re&s;t of our Relations, the Indians of the different Nations in our Alliance.</P></Q>
<P>Which being interpreted into <HI>Delaware,</HI> the String of Wampum was given to <HI>Mo&s;es Tetamy</HI> and <HI>James Davis,</HI> to be delivered to <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> as he was not pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Then taking up each Belt and String in the Order it was delivered in this, and the la&s;t Conference, he proceeded to repeat di&s;tinctly, what had been &s;aid under each Article, returning Thanks for all tho&s;e good Speeches, which he &s;aid, were extreamly agreeable. He made particular Mention of the large Peace Belt, &s;aying, <Q>The Nations are greatly plea&s;ed, that all the antient Treaties made here, at <HI>Albany,</HI> and el&s;ewhere, are renewed, as well as that the Old Council Fire at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> is kindled again, and a good Road made to it, that may be travelled without any Danger: The&s;e in particular, as well as every other Matter tran&s;acted at the&s;e Conferences, we will make known to our own Nations, and to every other in Friend&s;hip and Alliance with us, and we are &s;ure they will be very well received.</Q></P>
<P>Then addre&s;&s;ing Governor BERNARD, he thanked him for his farewell Speech, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, <Q>It was a very kind one, and that they were much plea&s;ed with his having <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">een pre&s;ent, and given his A&s;&s;i&s;tance at this Treaty, which had given them an Op|portunity of gaining an Acquaintance with him, which they would ever remember with Plea&s;ure. After a Pau&s;e he de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed for mentioning &s;ome Thing that had been omitted by the Governors and their Councils.</Q></P>
<Q><P>They have forgot to bring with them Ammunition, of which we always u&s;ed to receive a &s;ufficient Quantity, not only to &s;erve us in our Journey, but to &s;upport us in our hunting Sea&s;on, that we might be enabled to make Provi&s;ion for our Families. They have given us Gunlocks without Guns, which are of no Manner of U&s;e to us; and therefore this mu&s;t have &s;urely been forgot, as it is impo&s;&s;ible for Indians to &s;ub&s;i&s;t without Guns, Powder and Lead, of which we have received none.</P>
<P>As many of us are old and infirm, we de&s;ire our Brethren, will be &s;o good as to furni&s;h us with a Number of Waggons, to convey &s;uch of us, as are not able to walk, and the Goods you have been plea&s;ed to give us, as far as <HI>Wioming,</HI> where we have left our Canoes, and then we will di&s;charge the Waggons, and they may come back again.</P>
<P>We further de&s;ire a Supply of Provi&s;ions may be put into the Waggons, enough to &s;erve us till we get to our re&s;pective Habitations.</P></Q>
<P>He then took up the Proprietary Relea&s;e, and returned Thanks for it. He &s;aid, <Q>When the United Nations fir&s;t made the Reque&s;t to Sir <HI>William John&s;on,</HI> to be tran|&s;mitted to <HI>Onas,</HI> they had no doubt but <HI>Onas</HI> would comply with it, having always found him ready to grant all their Reque&s;ts. With him we have never had any Difference, he has always &s;ettled our Affairs without giving us any Trouble, and to our Satisfaction. We heartily thank <HI>Onas</HI>; this Act confirms us in the good Opinion we always had of him.</Q></P>
<P>Then addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the <HI>Delawares,</HI> with a String of Wampum, he &s;poke as follows,</P>
<Q><PB N="35" REF="008157_0035_102E3EEEE05E9F00">
<P>This &s;erves to put <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> in mind of his Promi&s;es, to return the Pri&s;oners: Remember, Cou&s;ins, you have made this Promi&s;e in our Pre&s;ence; you did it indeed before, and you ought to have performed it: To tell Lies, does not become a Great Man: A Great Man always keeps his Word and performs his Promi&s;es. Cou&s;ins, You mu&s;t not now fail to keep your Word: We are all now one People, and we mu&s;t all be punctual in the Performance of our Engagements.</P></Q>
<P>This was interpreted into the <HI>Delaware</HI> Language, and the String was given to <HI>Mo&s;es Tetamy,</HI> to be delivered to <HI>Teedyu&s;cung.</HI></P>
<P>Then he &s;aid, the United Nations had fini&s;hed what they had to &s;ay.</P>
<P>Some Wine and Punch was called for, and mutual Healths were drank, and the Conferences were concluded with great Satisfaction.</P>
