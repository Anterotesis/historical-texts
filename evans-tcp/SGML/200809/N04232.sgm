<HEAD>THE TREATY, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE Deputies of the Six Nations having, at their la&s;t Vi&s;it, agreed to relea&s;e their Claim to all the Land on both Sides of the River <HI>Sa&s;quehanab,</HI> as far South as this Province extends, and to the Northward to tho&s;e called the <HI>Endle&s;s Mountains</HI> or <HI>Kittochtinny Hills</HI>; in Con&s;ideration whereof, they then received a large Quantity of valuable Indian Goods for the Lands &s;ituate on the Ea&s;tern Side of the &s;aid River, but declined at that Time to receive any for tho&s;e on the We&s;tern Side of the &s;aid River, chu&s;ing to defer the &s;ame till another Vi&s;it; A large Number arrived from the&s;e Nations at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> on <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> the 30<HI>th</HI> of <HI>June,</HI> with Depu|ties duly impowered to receive the &s;aid Goods; and acquainted the Gover|nor, that being weary from the Fatigue of their long Journey, they &s;hould crave three or four Days to re&s;t them&s;elves before they proceeded to their Bu|&s;ine&s;s: In the mean time they would wait on the Governor to di&s;cour&s;e, ac|cording to their u&s;ual Method, about News and other Occurrences; which the Governor readily agreed to, and a&s;k'd them when they would chu&s;e to pay their fir&s;t Vi&s;it; which they de&s;iring might be on <HI>Friday:</HI> the 2<HI>d</HI> of <HI>July</HI> in the Afternoon, the Council was accordingly &s;ummon'd, and met at Mr. <HI>Logan's</HI> Hou&s;e, where were</P>

<P>The Governor opened the Conference as follows.</P>
<Q><P><HI>BRETHREN,</HI></P>
<P>The Proprietor having purcha&s;ed certain Lands from your Nations about Six Years ago, a Moiety of what was agreed to be given in Con&s;ideration <PB N="4" REF="005216_0004_101714408A40B5C8">of that Purcha&s;e was at that Time delivered to them, and the other being at their own De&s;ire left in the Proprietor's Hands, He pre&s;&s;ed you by <HI>Shi|kalamy</HI> to &s;end la&s;t Year for it, and would have been glad to have &s;een you and taken you by the Hand before his Departure. But as the De&s;ign of this Meeting is to hear your News and conver&s;e together in a free and friend|ly Manner, I &s;hall &s;ay no more about the Goods than that they lye ready at the Proprietor's Hou&s;e, and will be delivered when you &s;hall have &s;uffici|ently re&s;ted from the Fatigue of your Journey.</P></Q>
<P>The Chief of the <HI>Onondagoes</HI> &s;poke</P>
<P><Q><HI>BRETHREN,</HI> We propo&s;e to re&s;t four Days, and then come to the main Bu&s;ine&s;s. At pre&s;ent we are at a private Conference about News, and have &s;omething of this Sort to mention to our Brother <HI>Onas.</HI></Q> And on the Governor's &s;ignify|ing they would be glad to know what it was, the Chief proceeded.</P>
<Q><P><HI>BRETHREN,</HI></P>
<P>It is our Way when we come to our Brethren, or any other Per&s;ons, whom we live in &s;trict Friend&s;hip with, to remove all Ob&s;tructions to a good Un|der&s;tanding; with this View we are to inform you of a Piece of di&s;a reta|ble News that happen'd in our Journey.&mdash;Some White People living at a Place called <HI>Conegocheegoe,</HI> who&s;e Names we cannot tell, nor whether they belong to this or the neighbouring Government, but one of them, as we heard, had his Hou&s;e burnt over his Head &s;ome Years ago, and he was brought down a Pri&s;oner and committed to the Goal of this City: The&s;e People lighting of our young Warriours, as they were hunting, made &s;ome Propo&s;als about the Purcha&s;ing of Land from them, and our young Men being indi&s;creet, and unacquainted with Publick Bu&s;ine&s;s, were fooli&s;h enough to hearken to them, and to receive five Duffil Strowds for two Plantations on the River <HI>Cohongoronto.</HI> A <HI>Cone&s;togoe</HI> Indian, and a <HI>French</HI> Indian, and &s;ome others that were in Company had three Duffil Strowds, and went a|way with them; and our young Men carried off the other two. As &s;oon as this came to our Knowledge, we &s;ent for our Warriours, and after examin|ing and rebuking them &s;everely, we took away their two Strowds, and publickly cen&s;ured them for expo&s;ing us to our Brethren of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> in doing a Thing &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent with our Engagements to them; <Q>You are, &s;aid we aloud, that all our People might hear and take Notice, to know and remember, that the Six Nations have obliged them&s;elves to &s;ell none of the Land that falls within the Province of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> to any other but our Brother <HI>Onas,</HI> and that to &s;ell Lands to any other is an high Breach of the League of Friend&s;hip.</Q> Brethren, this ra&s;h Proceeding of our young Men makes us a&s;hamed. We always mean well, and &s;hall perform faith|fully what we have promi&s;ed: And we a&s;&s;ure you, this Affair was tran&s;ac|ted in the Manner we have related, without our Privity or Con&s;ent. And that you may be fully convinced of this, and of the Sincerity of our Intenti|ons, we have brought you the&s;e Two Strowds [<HI>here be pre&s;ented two Red Strowds to the Governor</HI>] they are the very Strowds our fooli&s;h young Men received; we took them from them, and we give them to you to return to tho&s;e white People who made the Bargain, and de&s;ire when the Strowds
<PB N="5" REF="005216_0005_101714426DFC7600">
are returned to them, they may be told what we now &s;ay, and that we &s;hall not confirm &s;uch Bargains nor any other that may interfere with our En|gagements to our Brother <HI>Onas.</HI></P></Q>
<P>The Governor then &s;poke:</P>
<Q><P><HI>BRETHREN,</HI></P>
<P>I thank you for this Piece of News; you have taken this Matter perfect|ly right. All Bargaining for Land within this Province, is, to be &s;ure, a manife&s;t Breach of your Contract with the Proprietors, and what we know you will not countenance. We have hitherto found the <HI>Six Nations</HI> faith|ful to their Engagements, and this is a fre&s;h In&s;tance of their Punctuality. You could not help the&s;e Mi&s;takes of your young Men; they were not done in your Pre&s;ence: But as &s;everal Inconveniences may ari&s;e from the&s;e kind of clande&s;tine Sales, or from any &s;uch loo&s;e Sales of Land by your People, we de&s;ire you will, on your Return home, give publick Notice to all your Warriours not to bargain for any Land; o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> if they do, that you will not confirm &s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h Bargains; and that this very Affair, together with what you have done therein, may be particularly reported to all your Nation a&s;|&s;embled in Council.</P></Q>
<P>The <HI>Onondago</HI> Chief promi&s;ed to give &s;uch publick Notice; and de|&s;iring Liberty to mend his former Speech, he proceeded:</P>
<Q><P><HI>BRETHREN,</HI></P>
<P>I forgot one Circum&s;tance: Our People who pretended to &s;ell the Land, demanded a Belt of Wampum of the Buyers to carry to their Chiefs; and on their declaring they had no Wampum, our Warriours &s;aid, they would not an&s;wer that their Chiefs would confirm this Bargain, &s;ince they never did any thing of this Nature without Wampum.</P></Q>
<P>The Governor, after a &s;hort Pau&s;e, &s;poke:</P>
<Q><P><HI>BRETHREN of the Six Nations,</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall take this Opportunity to relate to you a Piece of di&s;agreeable News I re|ceived &s;ome Days ago in a Letter from <HI>Le Tort</HI> the Indian Trader, at <HI>Allegheny,</HI> who &s;ays, <Q>That in <HI>May</HI> la&s;t &s;ome Indians of the <HI>Taway</HI> Nation, &s;uppo&s;|ed by us to be the <HI>Twightwees,</HI> in their Return from War, called and &s;tay|ed &s;ome Time with the <HI>Shawane&s;e</HI>; who being a&s;ked, and denying they had brought either Scalps or Pri&s;oners, the <HI>Shawane&s;e</HI> &s;u&s;pecting them, had the Curio&s;ity to &s;earch their Bags, and finding two Scalps in them that by the Softne&s;s of the Hair did not feel like Indian Scalps, they wa&s;h'd them clean and found them to be the Scalps of &s;ome Chri&s;tians. On this Di&s;co|very, the <HI>Twightwees</HI> were &s;o much a&s;hamed, that they &s;tole away from their Town in the Night-time; and coming, as they afterwards un|der&s;tood, to a little Village belonging to the <HI>Shawane&s;e,</HI> they told our Peo|ple that their Hearts were full of Grief; for, as they came along the Road, they found it all bloody; and having good Cau&s;e to believe it was made bloody with the Blood of &s;ome of the White Brethren, they had very &s;orrowfully &s;wept the Road; and de&s;ired them to inform the Governor of <HI>Pen&s;ilvania</HI> of their (the <HI>Twightwees</HI>) Grief; and how they had &s;wept 
<PB N="6" REF="005216_0006_10171443F9F3C8F0">
the Road clean.</Q> <HI>Le Tort</HI> adds, on Behalf of the <HI>Shawane&s;e,</HI> <Q>That they were much troubled and grieved at this unfortunate Accident; and prayed, as they had no Concern in it, more than by being In&s;truments to di&s;cover it, their Brethren would not blame them, nor &s;uffer a Mi&s;under|&s;tanding to ari&s;e between them on this Account: They would &s;weep the Road clean, and wipe all the Blood away; and de&s;ired their Brethren would be &s;atisfied with this, and not weep too much for a Misfortune that might not happen again as long as the Sun and Moon &s;hone.</Q></P>
<P>The Per&s;on who delivered me <HI>Le Tort</HI>'s Letter, brought this Bundle of Skins as a Pre&s;ent to me; but I told the Me&s;&s;enger, I would not meddle with it; he might leave it if he plea&s;ed: The Affair appear'd to me in a bad Light, and I would repre&s;ent it to the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> who were expec|ted in Town every Day. This is the Fact as I have it from <HI>Le Tort:</HI> I de&s;ire to be inform'd if you know any thing of this Matter; and if you do not, that you will make diligent Enquiry who committed the Murder, and who are the unhappy Sufferers, and a&s;&s;i&s;t us to obtain Satisfaction, if it &s;hall appear to be any of our Fellow-Subjects that have been treated in this Manner.</P></Q>
<P><HI>To inforce this Reque&s;t, I pre&s;ent you with this String of Wampum.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Onondago</HI> Chief, in Reply, &s;aid:</P>
<Q><P><HI>BRETHREN,</HI></P>
<P>We take this Information kindly at your Hands; we will take this String of Wampum Home with us to our Lodgings, and there con&s;ult about the mo&s;t regular and proper Steps to be taken by us to an&s;wer your Expectations; and when we have duly con&s;idered the Matter, we will return you an An&s;wer.</P></Q>
<P>Upon this the Governor put an End to the Conference; and calling for Wine and other Liquors, according to the <HI>Indian</HI> Cu&s;tom, after a decent and chearful Entertainment, the <HI>Indians</HI> withdrew.</P>

Dinner was provided for their Chiefs; and after they had made an hearty Meal, and drank his Maje&s;ty's Health, the Proprietors, and the Health of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> the Chiefs gave the &s;olemn Cry, in Te&s;timony of their Thanks, for the Honour done them. And &s;oon after the Governor began, in a free Way, to enquire for what Rea&s;on the <HI>Senecas</HI> were not come down, &s;ince they had an equal Right to a Share of the Goods with the other Nations.&mdash;<HI>Cana&s;&s;ateego,</HI> their Speaker, &s;aid, <Q>The <HI>Senecas</HI> were in great Di&s;tre&s;s, on Account of a Famine that raged in their Country, which had reduced them to &s;uch Want, that a Father had been obliged to kill two of his Children to pre&s;erve his own and the re&s;t of his Family's Lives; and they could not now come down, but had given Directions about their Share of the Goods.</Q>&mdash;The Governor expre&s;s'd his Concern for the un|happy Circum&s;tances of their Brethren of the <HI>Seneca</HI> Nation; and, after a &s;hort Re&s;pite, enquired if any of their Deputies were then at <HI>Canada,</HI> and whether the <HI>French</HI> Governor was making any warlike Preparations. And on their an&s;wering, <HI>Yes</HI>; the Governor &s;aid, with a &s;miling, plea&s;ant Counte|nance, <Q>I &s;uppo&s;e if the <HI>French</HI> &s;hould go to War with us, you will join them.</Q> The <HI>Indians</HI> conferr'd together for &s;ome Time, and then <HI>Cana&s;&s;a|teego,</HI> in a chearful lively Manner, made An&s;wer.&mdash;<Q>We a&s;&s;ure you, the Governor of <HI>Canada</HI> pays our Nations great Court at this Time, well knowing of what Con&s;equence we are to the <HI>French</HI> Intere&s;t: He has al|ready told us, he was uncovering the Hatchet and &s;harpening it, and hoped, if he &s;hould be obliged to lift it up again&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> their Nations would remain neuter and a&s;&s;i&s;t neither Side.&mdash;But we will now &s;peak plainly to our Brethren: Why &s;hould we, who are one Fle&s;h with you, refu&s;e to help you, whenever you want our A&s;&s;i&s;tance?&mdash; We have continued a long Time in the &s;tricte&s;t League of Amity and Friend&s;hip with you, and we &s;hall always be faithful and true to you our old and good Allies.&mdash;The Governor of <HI>Canada</HI> talks a great deal, but ten of his Words do not go &s;o far as one of yours.&mdash;We do not look towards them; We look towards you; and you may depend on our A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</Q> Whil&s;t the <HI>Onondago</HI> Chief made this open and hearty Declaration, all the other <HI>Indians</HI> made frequently that particular Kind of Noi&s;e which is known to be a Mark of Approbation.&mdash;The Governor bid the Interpreter tell <HI>Ca|na&s;&s;ateego,</HI> <Q>He did not &s;et on foot this Enquiry from any Su&s;picion he had of the <HI>Six Nations</HI> wanting a due Regard for the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI>&mdash;Our Experi|ence of their Honour and Faith would not permit us to think any other of them than that they would e&s;teem our Friends their Friends, and our Enemies their Enemies, agreeable to the &s;trict Union which had ever &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted between us.&mdash;As to the Governor of <HI>Canada,</HI> they need not mind what he &s;aid.&mdash;The <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> on equal Terms, had beat the <HI>French,</HI> and could beat them again: And were they but to con&s;ider the Advantages which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> have, by po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;o many large and populous Countries and &s;o many good Ports on the Continent of <HI>America,</HI> they would &s;oon &s;ee who had mo&s;t Rea&s;on to fear a War, the <HI>French</HI> or the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Here the Conver&s;ation drop'd; and, after another Gla&s;s of Wine, the <HI>In|dians</HI> re&s;umed the Di&s;cour&s;e, by a&s;king whether their Brethren had not been for &s;ome time engaged in a War with the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and what Succe&s;&s;es they had met with.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="005216_0008_10171451A49C8B18">
The Governor told them, the King of <HI>Great Britain</HI> lived in an I&s;land, and being &s;urrounded with the Sea, his chief Strength lay in his Ships; in which he was &s;o much &s;uperior to his Enemies, that they were &s;eldom to be met with on the broad Ocean, but &s;culk'd and hid them&s;elves, only venturing out now and then; and whenever they did they were almo&s;t &s;ure to be ta|ken; and that the King of <HI>Great Britain</HI> had, with his Ships, beat down or taken &s;everal of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Great Forts in <HI>America.</HI>&mdash;The <HI>Indians</HI> &s;aid, they were plea&s;ed to hear their Brethren were an Over-match for their Ene|mies, and wi&s;h'd them good Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>The Governor then inquired into the State and Condition of the Nations to the We&s;tward of the Great Lakes, and whether they had any Warriours then in tho&s;e Countries? Whether they had concluded Peace with the Southern <HI>Indians?</HI> And whether they had heard what their Deputies had done at <HI>Albany?</HI></P>
<P>They made An&s;wer: That they had always Abundance of their Men out among&s;t the Nations &s;ituate to the We&s;t of their Lakes.&mdash;That they had kindled a Fire with a va&s;t many Nations, &s;ome whereof were Tributaries, and they had a good Under&s;tanding with all.&mdash;They &s;et out from their own Country in Company with two Sets of Deputies, one going to hold a Treaty with the Southern <HI>Indians,</HI> and they believed a Peace would be concluded: The other going to meet the Governor of <HI>New-York,</HI> at <HI>Albany</HI>; but they could not tell what had been done at either Place.&mdash;On their Return, they were to hold a General Council, and would inform their Brethren of the&s;e Particulars.</P>
<P>Then the Governor put an End to the Conference, by telling the <HI>Indians</HI> the Goods would be delivered to them at a Council to be held to morrow Afternoon at the Meeting-Hou&s;e.</P>

The Governor, having commanded Silence, &s;poke as follows:</P>
<Q><P><HI>Friends and Brethren of the Six Nations,</HI></P>
<P>Six Years ago a Number of your Chiefs obliged us with a Vi&s;it, when they agreed, on Behalf of your Nations, to the Relea&s;e of certain Lands on both Sides the River <HI>Sa&s;quehannah,</HI> to the Southward of the <HI>Endle&s;s|Mountains,</HI> and within the Limits and Bounds of the King's Grant of this Province. In Con&s;ideration of which, a certain Quantity of Goods was agreed on and delivered as a full Satisfaction for the &s;aid Lands lying on the Ea&s;tern Side of the &s;aid River: And for the Lands on the We&s;tern Side of the &s;aid River, you de&s;ired the Payment &s;hould be deferr'd &s;ill another Op|portunity. The&s;e Goods, which are exactly the &s;ame in Quantity as tho&s;e you received the la&s;t Time the Chiefs of your Nations were here, have been ready a con&s;iderable Time, and kept in Expectation of your Coming for them: And now you are come down fully impowered by your re&s;pective Councils to receive them, we are well plea&s;ed to deliver them: Leaving it to you to make a fair and equal Divi&s;ion of them among&s;t your&s;elves. We are &s;orry for the Ab&s;ence of our Brethren the <HI>Senecas,</HI> and much more &s;o that it &s;hould be owing to their Di&s;tre&s;s at Home by a Famine that rages in their Country:&mdash;A Famine &s;o great that you tell us a Father has been obliged to &s;acrifice one Part of his Family, even his own Children, for the Support and Pre&s;ervation of him&s;elf, and the other Part.&mdash;We heartily commi&s;erate their Condition, and do not doubt but you will do them fair and ample Ju&s;tice in the Di&s;po&s;al of their Part of the Goods in &s;uch Manner as they have in&s;tructed you. You &s;hall now hear the Li&s;t of the Goods read to you.</P></Q>
<P>Here, by the Governor's Order, the Li&s;t of the Goods was read over, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<P>Then the Governor told them that the Goods, of which the Particulars had been ju&s;t read to them, were in the Meeting-Hou&s;e, and would be &s;ent to whatever Place they would direct.</P>
<P>The Governor then proceeded:</P>
<Q><P><HI>BRETHREN,</HI></P>
<P>You have often heard of the Care that your great and good Friend and Brother <HI>William Penn</HI> took at all Times to cultivate a perfect good Har|mony with all the <HI>Indians:</HI> Of this your Nations have ever been fully &s;en|&s;ible; but more e&s;pecially a Number of your Chiefs, about ten Years ago,
<PB N="11" REF="005216_0011_101714584AEDAB20">
when, on the Arrival of a Son of your &s;aid great Friend <HI>William Penn,</HI> large and valuable Pre&s;ents were exchanged by us with you; a new Road was made and clear'd; a new Fire kindled; and the Chain of Friend&s;hip made &s;tronger &s;o as to la&s;t while the Sun and Moon endure.</P>
<P>And now we cannot but congratulate our&s;elves that your Coming &s;hould happen at a Time when we are in daily Expectation of a War being de|clared between the King of <HI>England,</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> King, well knowing that &s;hould &s;uch a War happen, it mu&s;t very &s;en&s;ibly affect you, con&s;idering your Situation in the Neighbourhood of <HI>Canada.</HI> Your Coming at this Juncture is particularly fortunate, &s;ince it gives us an Opportunity of mentioning &s;everal Things that may be nece&s;&s;ary to be &s;ettled between People &s;o &s;trictly and clo&s;ely united as we are.&mdash;An Union not to be ex|pre&s;s'd by any thing le&s;s than the affectionate Regards which Children of the &s;ame Parents bear for each other, as conceiving our&s;elves to be one Fle&s;h and one People.</P>
<P>The utmo&s;t Care therefore ought mutually to be taken by us on both Sides, that the Road between us be kept perfectly clear and open, and no Lets nor the lea&s;t Ob&s;truction be &s;uffered to lie in the Way; or if any &s;hould by Accident be found, that may hinder our free Intercour&s;e and Corre&s;pondence, it mu&s;t forthwith be removed.</P></Q>
<P>To inforce this, We lay down a String of Wampum.</P>
<Q><P>In next Place, We, on our Part, &s;hall inlarge our Fire that burns be|tween us. We &s;hall provide more Fewel to increa&s;e it and make it burn brighter and clearer, and give a &s;tronger and more la&s;ting Light and Warmth.</P></Q>
<P>In Evidence of our &s;incere Intentions, We lay down this Belt of Wampum.</P>
<Q><P>In the la&s;t Place, con&s;idering the Obligations we are mutually under by our &s;everal Treaties, "That we &s;hould hear with our Ears for you, and you hear with your Ears for us." We &s;hall at all Times very willingly give you the earlie&s;t and be&s;t Intelligence of any De&s;igns that may be form'd to your Di&s;advantage.&mdash;And if you di&s;cover any Preparations that can hurt us, we de&s;ire you will immediately di&s;patch &s;ome &s;uitable Per&s;on in whom we can place a Confidence, to give us a proper Information.</P></Q>
<P>To inforce this Reque&s;t, as well as to brighten the Chain, we lay down this other Belt of Wampum.</P>
<P>On the Governor's concluding the Speech, the &s;olemn Cry by way of Approbation was repeated by the <HI>Indians</HI> as many Times as there were Na|tions pre&s;ent; and then <HI>Cana&s;&s;ateego</HI> ro&s;e up and &s;poke.</P>
<Q><P>BRETHREN,</P>
<P>We thank you for your kind Speech: What you have &s;aid is very agree|able to us; and to-morrow when we have deliberated on the &s;everal Mat|ters recommended to us, we will give you our An&s;wer. We de&s;ire, as our Time will be wholly taken up in Council, you will order the Goods to be carried back to the Proprietaries to prevent their being lo&s;t, and that they may continue there till we call for them.</P></Q>

<P><HI>CANASSATEEGO</HI>'s Speech on Behalf of the <HI>Six Nations.</HI></P>
<Q><P>BRETHREN, the Governor and Council, and all pre&s;ent,</P>
<P>According to our Promi&s;e we now propo&s;e to return you an An&s;wer to the &s;everal Things mentioned to us Ye&s;terday, and &s;hall beg Leave to &s;peak to Publick Affairs fir&s;t, tho' they were what you &s;poke to la&s;t. On this Head you Ye&s;terday put us in Mind, fir&s;t, <Q>Of <HI>William Penn</HI>'s early and con&s;tant Care to cultivate Friend&s;hip with all the <HI>Indians</HI>; of the Treaty we held with one of his Sons, about ten Years ago; and of the Nece&s;&s;ity there is at this Time of keeping the Roads between us clear and free from all Ob&s;tructions.</Q> We are all very &s;en&s;ible of the kind Regard that good Man <HI>William Penn</HI> had for all the <HI>Indians,</HI> and cannot but be plea&s;ed to find that his Children have the &s;ame. We well remember the Treaty you mention held with his Son on his Arrival here, by which we confirmed our League of Friend&s;hip that is to la&s;t as long as the Sun and Moon endure: In Con&s;equence of this, We, on our Part, &s;hall pre&s;erve the Road free from all Incumbrances; in Confirmation whereof we lay down this String of Wampum.</P>
<P>You in the next Place &s;aid you would inlarge the Fire and make it burn brighter, which we are plea&s;ed to hear you mention; and a&s;&s;ure you, we &s;hall do the &s;ame, by adding to it more Fewel, that it may &s;till flame out more &s;trongly than ever: In the la&s;t Place, you were plea&s;ed to &s;ay that we are bound, by the &s;tricte&s;t Leagues, to watch for each others Pre&s;erva|tion; that we &s;hould hear with our Ears for you, and you hear with your Ears for us: This is equally agreeable to us; and we &s;hall not fail to give you early Intelligence whenever any thing of Con&s;equence comes to our Knowledge: And to encourage you to do the &s;ame, and to nouri&s;h in your Hearts what you have &s;poke to us with your Tongues, about the Renewal of our Amity and the Brightening of the Chain of Friend&s;hip; we confirm what we have &s;aid with another Belt of Wampum.</P>
<P>BRETHREN,</P>
<P>We received from the Proprietors, ye&s;terday, &s;ome Goods in Con&s;idera|tion of our Relea&s;e of the Lands on the We&s;t-Side of <HI>Sa&s;quehannah,</HI> It is true we have the full Quantity according to Agreement; but if the Pro|prietor had been here him&s;elf, we think, in Regard of our Numbers and Poverty, he would have made an Addition to them.&mdash;If the Goods were only to be divided among&s;t the <HI>Indians</HI> pre&s;ent, a &s;ingle Per&s;on would have but a &s;mall Portion; but if you con&s;ider what Numbers are left behind, equally entitled with us to a Share, there will be extremely little. We therefore de&s;ire, if you have the Keys of the Proprietor's Che&s;t, you will open it, and take out a little more for us.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="005216_0013_1017145C344C5610">
We know our Lands are now become more valuable: The white People think we do not know their Value; but we are &s;en&s;ible that the Land is everla&s;ting, and the few Goods we receive for it are &s;oon worn out and gone. For the Future we will &s;ell no Lands but when Brother <HI>Onas</HI> is in the Country; and we will know beforehand the Quantity of the Goods we are to receive. Be&s;ides, we are not well u&s;ed with re&s;pect to the Lands &s;till un&s;old by us. Your People daily &s;ettle on the&s;e Lands, and &s;poil our Hunting.&mdash;We mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t on your Removing them, as you know they have no Right to &s;ettle to the Northward of <HI>Kittochtinny-Hills.</HI>&mdash;In particular, we renew our Complaints again&s;t &s;ome People who are &s;ettled at <HI>Juniata,</HI> a Branch of <HI>Sa&s;quahannah,</HI> and all along the Banks of that River, as far as <HI>Mahaniay</HI>; and de&s;ire they may be forthwith made to go off the Land; for they do great Damage to our Cou&s;ins the <HI>Delawares.</HI></P>
<P>We have further to ob&s;erve, with re&s;pect to the Lands lying on the We&s;t Side of <HI>Sa&s;quahannah,</HI> that tho' Brother <HI>Onas</HI> (meaning the Proprietor) has paid us for what his People po&s;&s;e&s;s, yet &s;ome Parts of that Country have been taken up by Per&s;ons who&s;e Place of Re&s;idence is to the South of this Province, from whom we have never received any Con&s;ideration. This Affair was recommended to you by our Chiefs at our la&s;t Treaty; and you then, at our earne&s;t De&s;ire, promi&s;ed to write a Letter to that Per&s;on who has the Authority over tho&s;e People, and to procure us his An&s;wer: As we have never heard from you on this Head, we want to know what you have done in it. If you have not done any thing, we now renew our Reque&s;t, and de&s;ire you will inform the Per&s;on who&s;e People are &s;eated on our Lands, that that Country belongs to us, in Right of Conque&s;t; we having bought it with our Blood, and taken it from our Enemies in fair War; and we expect, as Owners of that Land, to receive &s;uch a Con&s;ideration for it as the Land is worth. We de&s;ire you will pre&s;s him to &s;end us a po&s;itive An&s;wer: Let him &s;ay <HI>Yes</HI> or <HI>No</HI>: If he &s;ays Yes, we we will treat with him; if No, we are able to do our&s;elves Ju&s;tice; and we will do it, by going to take Payment our&s;elves.</P>
<P>It is cu&s;tomary with us to make a Pre&s;ent of Skins whenever we renew our Treaties. We are a&s;hamed to offer our Brethren &s;o few; but your Hor&s;es and Cows have eat the Gra&s;s our Deer u&s;ed to feed on. This has made them &s;carce, and will, we hope, plead in Excu&s;e for our not bringing a larger Quantity: If we could have &s;pared more we would have given more; but we are really poor; and de&s;ire you'll not con&s;ider the Quantity, but, few as they are, accept them in Te&s;timony of our Regard.</P></Q>
<P>Here they gave the Governor a Bundle of Skins.</P>
<P>The Governor immediately replied:</P>
<Q><P>BRETHREN,</P>
<P>We thank you for the many Declarations of Re&s;pect you have given us in this &s;olemn Renewal of our Treaties: We receive, and &s;hall keep your String and Belts of Wampum, as Pledges of your Sincerity, and de&s;ire tho&s;e we gave you may be carefully pre&s;erved, as Te&s;timonies of ours.</P>
<P>In An&s;wer to what you &s;ay about the Proprietaries.&mdash;They are all ab|&s;ent, and have taken the Keys of their Che&s;t with them; &s;o that we can|not,
<PB N="14" REF="005216_0014_101714638CB40788">
on their Behalf, enlarge the Quantity of Goods: Were they here, they might, perhaps, be more generous; but we cannot be liberal for them.&mdash;The Government will, however, take your Reque&s;t into Con&s;ider|ation, and, in Regard to your Poverty, may perhaps make you a Pre&s;ent. I but ju&s;t mention this now, intending to refer this Part of your Speech to be an&s;wered at our next Meeting.</P>
<P>The Number of Guns, as well as every thing el&s;e, an&s;wers exactly with the Particulars &s;pecified in your Deed of Conveyance, which is more than was agreed to be given you. It was your own Sentiments, that the Lands on the We&s;t Side of <HI>Sa&s;quahannah</HI> were not &s;o valuable as tho&s;e on the Ea&s;t; and an Abatement was to be made, proportionable to the Difference in Value: But the Proprietor overlooked this, and ordered the &s;ull Quantity to be delivered, which you will look on as a Favour.</P>
<P>It is very true, that Lands are of late become more valuable; but what rai&s;es their Value? Is it not entirely owing to the Indu&s;try and La|bour u&s;ed by the white People in their Cultivation and Improvement? Had not they come among&s;t you, the&s;e Lands would have been of no U&s;e to you, any further than to maintain you. And is there not, now you have &s;old &s;o much, enough left for all the Purpo&s;es of Living?&mdash;What you &s;ay of the Goods, that they are &s;oon worn out, is applicable to every thing; but you know very well, that they co&s;t a great deal Money, and the Value of Land is no more than it is worth in Money.</P>
<P>On your former Complaints again&s;t People's Setling the Lands on <HI>Ju|niata,</HI> and from thence all along on the River <HI>Sa&s;quahannah</HI> as far as <HI>Ma|hania<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y,</HI> &s;ome Magi&s;trates were &s;ent expre&s;sly to remove them; and we thought no Per&s;ons would pre&s;ume to &s;tay after that.</P></Q>
<P>Here they interrupted the Governor, and &s;aid:&mdash;<Q>The&s;e Per&s;ons who were &s;ent did not do their Duty: So far from removing the People, they made Surveys for them&s;elves, and they are in League with the Tre&s;pa&s;&s;ers. We de&s;ire more effectual Methods may be u&s;ed, and hone&s;ter Per&s;ons imploy'd.</Q></P>
<P>Which the Governor promi&s;ed, and then proceeded:</P>
<Q><P>BRETHREN,</P>
<P>According to the Promi&s;e made at our la&s;t Treaty with you, Mr. <HI>Logan,</HI> who was at that Time Pre&s;ident, did write to the Governor of <HI>Maryland,</HI> that he might make you Satisfaction for &s;uch of your Lands as his People had taken up; but did not receive one Word from him upon that Head. I will write to him again, and endeavour to procure you a &s;atisfactory An&s;wer. We do not doubt but he will do you Ju&s;tice: But we exhort you to be careful not to exerci&s;e any Acts of Violence towards his People, as they likewi&s;e are our Brethren, and Subjects of the &s;ame Great King; and therefore Violence towards them mu&s;t be productive of very evil Con&s;equences.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude what I have to &s;ay at this Time with Acknowledgments for your Pre&s;ent; which is very agreeable to us, from the Expre&s;&s;ions of Regard u&s;ed by you in pre&s;enting it: Gifts of this Nature receiving their
<PB N="15" REF="005216_0015_10171468DF426548">
Value from the Affection of the Giver, and not from the Quantity or Price of the Thing given.</P></Q>

<P>The Governor informed the Board, that the <HI>Indian</HI> Chiefs dining with him Ye&s;terday, after Dinner delivered their An&s;wer to two Affairs of Con&s;equence;</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="005216_0016_1017146A6A04A720">
The fir&s;t related to the violent Battery committed on <HI>William Webb,</HI> in the Forks of <HI>Delaware,</HI> whereby his Jaw-Bone was broke, and his Life greatly endangered, by an unknown <HI>Indian. Cana&s;&s;atego</HI> repeating the Me&s;&s;age de|livered to the <HI>Six Nations</HI> by <HI>Shickcalamy,</HI> in the Year 1740, with a String of Wampum, &s;aid in An&s;wer: <Q>The <HI>Six Nations</HI> had made diligent Enquiry into the Affair, and had found out the <HI>Indian</HI> who had committed the Fact; he lived near <HI>A&s;opus,</HI> and had been examined and &s;everely reprov'd: And they hoped, as <HI>William Webb</HI> was recovered, the Governor would not expect any further Puni&s;hment; and therefore they returned the String of Wampum received from their Brethren, by the Hand of <HI>Shickcalamy,</HI> in Token that they had fully comply'd with their Reque&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>I thank'd them for their Care; but reminded them, that tho' the Man did not die, yet he lay a long Time in extreme Mi&s;ery, and would never re|cover the free U&s;e of his Speech, and was rendered le&s;s able to get his Live|lihood, and in &s;uch Ca&s;es the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Laws obliged the A&s;&s;ailant to make good all Damages, be&s;ides paying for the Pain endured. &mdash; But as the <HI>Indian</HI> was, in all Probability, poor and unable to make Satisfaction, I told them, that for their Sake I would forgive him; adding, had <HI>Webb</HI> died I make no Doubt but you would have put the <HI>Indian</HI> to Death, ju&s;t as we did two of our People who had killed an <HI>Indian</HI>; we cau&s;ed them to be hung on a Gal|lows, in the Pre&s;ence of many Hundreds of our People, to deter all others from doing the like. <HI>Cana&s;&s;atego</HI> made me this Reply: <Q>The <HI>Indians</HI> know no Puni&s;hment but Death; they have no &s;uch Thing as pecuniary Mulcts; if a Man be guilty of a Crime, he is either put to Death, or the Fault is overlook'd. We have often heard of your Hanging-up tho&s;e two Per&s;ons; but as none of our <HI>Indians</HI> &s;aw the Men die, many believe they were not hanged, but tran&s;ported to &s;ome other Colony: And it would be &s;atisfactory to the <HI>Indians,</HI> if, for the Future, &s;ome of them be &s;ent for, to be Wit|ne&s;&s;es of &s;uch Executions.</Q> I a&s;&s;ured them, that whoever gave them that Information, abu&s;ed them; for the Per&s;ons certainly &s;uffered Death, and in the Pre&s;ence of all the People.</P>
<P><HI>Cana&s;&s;atego</HI> then proceeded to give an An&s;wer to what was &s;aid to them the 2d In&s;tant relating to <HI>Le Tort</HI>'s Letter: <Q>That they had, in Council, con&s;i|dered in what Manner the Matter recommended to them ought to be con|ducted; and they were of Opinion, that as the <HI>Shawane&s;e,</HI> not the <HI>Twightwys</HI> (for they knew &s;o much of it that the People were of the <HI>Twightwy</HI> Na|tion in who&s;e Bags the Scalps were found) had &s;ent me a Pre&s;ent of Skins, I &s;hould, in return, &s;end them a Blanket or a Kettle, and with it a very &s;harp Me&s;&s;age, that tho' they had done well in &s;weeping the Road from Blood, yet that was but a &s;mall Part of their Duty; they ought not to have &s;uffered the <HI>Twightwys,</HI> after their Lie and the Di&s;covery of the Scalps, to have left them, 'til they had given a full and true Account how they came by them, who&s;e Scalps they were, and in what Place, and for what Rea|&s;on the Men were kill'd; and when they had been fully &s;atisfied of all the&s;e Particulars, then it was their Duty to have given Information to the Go|vernment where the white People lived, that the Murderers might be complained again&s;t, and puni&s;hed by the Nation they belong'd to: And as the <HI>Shawane&s;e</HI> had omitted to perform the Part of Brethren, that I &s;hould reprove them for it, and charge them to make Amends for their Neglect, by u&s;ing all po&s;&s;ible Expedition to come at the Knowledge of the&s;e Things, and to aid their Brethren the white People in obtaining Ju&s;tice.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="005216_0017_1017146D61985F50">
The Minutes of the preceding Council being read, Mr. <HI>Logan,</HI> in Pur&s;u|ance of the Board's Direction of Ye&s;terday, reported, on Behalf of him&s;elf and the other Gentlemen to whom it was recommended, that they had con|fer'd with Mr. <HI>Kin&s;ey,</HI> and reque&s;ted him to con&s;ult the other Members of the A&s;&s;embly concerning the making a Pre&s;ent to the <HI>Indians</HI>; and that Mr. <HI>Kin&s;ey</HI> having collected the Sentiments of &s;everal Members of the A&s;&s;embly in Town, whom he had confer'd with on that Subject, found them generally of Opinion, that a Pre&s;ent &s;hould at this Time be made; but that they had declined nominating any Sum: However, that Mr. <HI>Kin&s;ey</HI> had given it as his own Opinion, that the Governor and Council might go as far as <HI>Three Hundred Pounds.</HI></P>
<P>And accordingly it is refer'd to Mr. <HI>Logan,</HI> Mr. <HI>Pre&s;ton</HI> and Mr. <HI>Lawrence,</HI> to con&s;ider of and prepare a proper Li&s;t of the Goods whereof the Pre&s;ent &s;hould be compo&s;ed, to the Value of <HI>Three Hundred Pounds</HI> as afore&s;aid; ad|vi&s;ing with the Interpreter as to the Quantity and Quality.</P>

<P>The la&s;t Time the Chiefs of the <HI>Six Nations</HI> were here, they were informed, that your Cou&s;ins, a Branch of the <HI>Delawares,</HI> gave this Province &s;ome Di&s;turbance about the Lands the Proprietor purcha|&s;ed from them, and for which their Ance&s;tors had received a valuable Con&s;ideration above <HI>Fifty-five</HI> Years ago, as appears by a Deed now lying on the Table.&mdash;Sometime after this, <HI>Conrad Wei&s;er</HI> delivered to your Bro|ther <HI>Thomas Penn</HI> your Letter, wherein you reque&s;t of him and <HI>James Logan</HI> that they would not buy Land, &amp;c.&mdash;This has been &s;hewn to them and interpreted; notwith&s;tanding which they have continued their former Di&s;turbances, and have had the In&s;olence to write Letters to &s;ome of the Magi&s;trates of this Government, wherein they have abu&s;ed your good Brethren our worthy Proprietaries, and treated them with the utmo&s;t Rudene&s;s and Ill-Manners. Being loth, from our Regard to you, to puni&s;h them as they de&s;erve, I &s;ent two Me&s;&s;engers to inform them that you were expected here, and &s;hould be acquainted with their Behaviour.&mdash;As you,

on all Occa&s;ions, apply to us to remove all white People that are &s;ettled on Lands before they are purcha&s;ed from you, and we do our our Endeavours to turn &s;uch People off; we now expect from you, that you will cau&s;e the&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> to remove from the Lands in the Forks of <HI>Delaware,</HI> and not give any further Di&s;turbance to the Per&s;ons who are now in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P></Q>

<P>This Meeting will be &s;hort: It is in order to make you a Pre&s;ent from the Governor, the Council, the A&s;&s;embly, and all our People. <HI>William Penn</HI> was known to you to be a good and faithful Friend to all the <HI>In|dians:</HI> He made a League of Friend&s;hip with you, by which we became one People. This League has often &s;ince been renew'd by friendly Trea|ties; and as you have declared that the Friend&s;hip &s;hall always la&s;t on your Parts, &s;o we would have you believe that it &s;hall remain inviolable on ours while Sun and Moon endure.</P>
<P>I gave you &s;ome Expectation of a Pre&s;ent, and we have it now ready to deliver to you. This Pre&s;ent is made you by the Governor, Council, A&s;|&s;embly, and all our People, in Con&s;ideration of the great Mi&s;eries and Di&s;|tre&s;&s;es which you our good Friends have lately &s;uffered. This will be &s;ome Relief to you for the pre&s;ent, and it's to be hoped your own Indu&s;try will &s;oon retrieve your Circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>It has &s;ometimes happened, and may happen again, that idle and untrue Stories are carried to you concerning us your Brethren; but our De&s;ire is, and we expect it from you, that you will give no Credit to them; for we are, and always will be, your &s;teady and &s;incere Friends.</P>
<P>It is a Cu&s;tom when we renew our Treaties with our good Friends the <HI>Indians,</HI> to clear the Road and make our Fire burn bright: We have done &s;o upon this Occa&s;ion; and, in Token of our Sincerity, we deliver you, as

<P>The other Day you informed us of the Mi&s;behaviour of our Cou&s;ins the <HI>Delawares,</HI> with re&s;pect to their continuing to claim, and refu&s;ing to remove from &s;ome Land on the River <HI>Delaware,</HI> notwith&s;tanding their Ance&s;tors had &s;old it by a Deed under their Hands and Seals to the Pro|prietaries,
<PB N="21" REF="005216_0021_1017147AF1652828">
for a valuable Con&s;ideration, upwards of <HI>Fifty</HI> Years ago; and notwith&s;tanding that they them&s;elves had about <GAP DESC="blank"> Years ago, after a a long and full Examination, ratified that Deed of their Ance&s;tors, and given a fre&s;h one under their Hands and Seals; and then you reque&s;ted us to remove them, inforcing your Reque&s;t with a String of Wampum.&mdash;Af|terwards you laid on the Table our own Letters by <HI>Conrad Wei&s;er,</HI> &s;ome of our Cou&s;ins Letters, and the &s;everal Writings, to prove the Charge again&s;t our Cou&s;ins, with a Draught of the Land in Di&s;pute.&mdash;We now tell you, we have peru&s;ed all the&s;e &s;everal Papers: We &s;ee with our own Eyes, that they have been a very unruly People, and are altogether in the Wrong in their Dealings with you.&mdash;We have concluded to remove them, and oblige them to go over the River <HI>Delaware,</HI> and quit all Claim to any Lands on this Side for the Future, &s;ince they have received Pay for them, and it is gone thro' their Guts long ago.&mdash;To confirm to you that we will &s;ee your Reque&s;t executed, we lay down this String of Wampum in return for yours.</P></Q>
<P>Then turning to the <HI>Delawares,</HI> holding a Belt of Wampum in his Hand, he &s;poke to them as follows:</P>
<Q><P><HI>COUSINS,</HI></P>
<P>Let this Belt of Wampum &s;erve to cha&s;ti&s;e you. You ought to be taken by the Hair of the Head and &s;haked &s;everely, till you recover your Sen&s;es and become &s;ober. You don't know what Ground you &s;tand on, nor what you are doing. Our Brother <HI>Onas</HI>'s Cau&s;e is very ju&s;t and plain, and his Intentions to pre&s;erve Friend&s;hip. On the other Hand, Your Cau&s;e is bad; your Heart far from being upright; and you are maliciou&s;ly bent to break the Chain of Friend&s;hip with our Brother <HI>Onas</HI> and his People. We have &s;een with our Eyes a Deed &s;ign'd by nine of your Ance&s;tors above <HI>Fifty</HI> Years ago for this very Land, and a Relea&s;e &s;ign'd, not many Years &s;ince, by &s;ome of your&s;elves and Chiefs now living, to the Number of fifteen or upwards.&mdash;But how came you to take upon you to &s;ell Land at all: We conquered you; we made Women of you; you know you are Women, and can no more &s;ell Land than Women; nor is it fit you &s;hould have the Power of &s;elling Lands, &s;ince you would abu&s;e it. This Land that you claim is gone through your Guts; you have been furni&s;h'd with Cloaths, Meat and Drink, by the Goods paid you for it, and now you want it again, like Children as you are.&mdash;But what makes you &s;ell Land in the Dark. Did you ever tell us that you had &s;old this Land. Did we ever receive any Part, even the Value of a Pipe-Shank, from you for it. You have told us a blind Story, that you &s;ent a Me&s;&s;enger to us to inform us of the Sale, but he never came among&s;t us, nor we never heard any thing about it.&mdash;This is acting in the Dark, and very different from the Conduct our <HI>Six</HI> Nations ob&s;erve in their Sales of Land; on &s;uch Oc|ca&s;ions they give publick Notice, and invite all the <HI>Indians</HI> of their united Nations, and give them all a Share of the Pre&s;ent they receive for their Lands.&mdash;This is the Behaviour of the wi&s;e united Nations.&mdash;But we find you are none of our Blood: You act a di&s;hone&s;t Part, not only in this but in other Matters: Your Ears are ever open to &s;landerous Reports about
<PB N="22" REF="005216_0022_1017147F5BEF8128">
our Brethren; you receive them with as much Greedine&s;s as lewd Women receive the Embraces of bad Men. And for all the&s;e Rea&s;ons we charge you to remove in&s;tantly; we don't give you the Liberty to think about it. You are Women. Take the Advice of a wife Man, and remove immedi|ately. You may return to the other Side of <HI>Delaware</HI> where you came from: But we do not know whether, con&s;idering how you have demean'd your&s;elves, you will be permitted to live there; or whether you have not &s;wallowed that Land down your Throats as well as the Land on this Side. We therefore a&s;&s;ign you two Places to go, either to <HI>Wyomen or Shamokin.</HI> You may go to either of the&s;e Places, and then we &s;hall have you more under our Eye, and &s;hall &s;ee how you behave. Don't deliberate; but re|move away, and take this Belt of Wampum.</P></Q>
<P>This being interpreted by <HI>Conrad Wei&s;er</HI> into <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and by <HI>Cornelius Spring</HI> into the <HI>Delaware</HI> Language, <HI>Cana&s;&s;atego</HI> taking a String of Wampum, added further.</P>
<Q><P>After our ju&s;t Reproof, and ab&s;olute Order to depart from the Land, you are now to take Notice of what we have further to &s;ay to you. This String of Wampum &s;erves to forbid you, your Children and Grand-Chil|dren, to the late&s;t Po&s;terity forever, medling in Land-Affairs; neither you nor any who &s;hall de&s;cend from you, are ever hereafter to pre&s;ume to &s;ell any Land: For which P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rpo&s;e, you are to pre&s;erve this String, in Memory of what your Uncles have this Day given you in Charge.&mdash;We have &s;ome other Bu&s;ine&s;s to tran&s;act with our Brethren, and therefore depart the Council, and con&s;ider what has been &s;aid to you.</P></Q>
<P><HI>Cana&s;&s;atego</HI> then &s;poke to the Governor and Council:</P>
<Q><P><HI>BRETHREN,</HI></P>
<P>We called at our old Friend <HI>James Logan</HI>'s, in our Way to this City, and to our Grief we found him hid in the Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">es, and retired, thro' Infir|mities, from Publick Bu&s;ine&s;s. We pre&s;s'd him to leave his Retirement and prevailed with him to a&s;&s;i&s;t once more on our Account at your Councils. We hope, notwith&s;tanding his Age, and the Effects of a Fit of Sickne&s;s, which we under&s;tand has hurt his Con&s;titution, that he may yet continue a long Time to a&s;&s;i&s;t this Province with his Coun&s;els. He is a wife Man, and a fa&s;t Friend to the <HI>Indians.</HI> And we de&s;ire, when his Soul goes to GOD, you may chu&s;e in his Room ju&s;t &s;uch another Per&s;on, of the &s;ame Prudence and Ability in Coun&s;elling, and of the &s;ame tender Di&s;po&s;ition and Affection for the <HI>Indians.</HI> In Te&s;timony of our Gratitude for all his Services, and becau&s;e he was &s;o good as to leave his Country-Hou&s;e, and follow us to Town, and be at the Trouble, in this his advanced Age, to attend the Council; we pre&s;ent him with this Bundle of Skins.</P>
<P><HI>BRETHREN,</HI></P>
<P>It is always our Way, at the Conclu&s;ion of a Treaty, to de&s;ire you will u&s;e your Endeavours with the Traders, that they may &s;ell their Goods cheaper
<PB N="23" REF="005216_0023_10171482ACC0B210">
and give us a better Price for our Deer-Skins. Whenever any particular Sort of <HI>Indian</HI> Goods is &s;carce, they con&s;tantly make us pay the dearer on that Account. We mu&s;t now u&s;e the &s;ame Argument with them: Our Deer are killed in &s;uch Quantities, and our Hunting-Countries grown le&s;s every Day, by the Settlement of white People, that Game is now difficult to find, and we mu&s;t go a great Way in Que&s;t of it; they therefore ought to give us a better Price for our Skins; and we de&s;ire you would &s;peak to them to do &s;o. We have been &s;tinted in the Article of Rum in Town. We de&s;ire you will open the Rum-Bottle, and give it to us in greater Abundance on the Road.</P></Q>
<P><HI>To inforce our Reque&s;t, about the</HI> Indian <HI>Traders, we pre&s;ent you with this Bundle of Skins.</HI></P>
<Q><P><HI>BRETHREN,</HI></P>
<P>When we fir&s;t came to your Hou&s;es, we found them clean and in Order: But we have &s;taid &s;o long as to dirty them; which is to be imputed to our different Way of Living from the white People: And therefore, as we cannot but have been di&s;agreeable to you on this Account, we pre&s;ent you with &s;ome Skins to make your Hou&s;es clean, and put them into the &s;ame Condition they were in when we came among&s;t you.</P>
<P><HI>BRETHREN,</HI></P>
<P>The Bu&s;ine&s;s the <HI>Five</HI> Nations tran&s;act with you is of great Con&s;equence, and requires a &s;kilful and hone&s;t Per&s;on to go between us; one in whom both you and we can place a Confidence.&mdash;We e&s;teem our pre&s;ent Inter|preter to be &s;uch a Per&s;on, equally faithful in the Interpretation of what|ever is &s;aid to him by either of us, equally allied to both; he is of our Nation, and a Member of our Council as well as of yours. When we adopted him, we divided him into Two equal Parts: One we kept for our &s;elves, and one we left for you. He has had a great deal of Trouble with us, wore out his Shoes in our Me&s;&s;ages, and dirty'd his Cloaths by being among&s;t us, &s;o that he is become as na&s;ty as an <HI>Indian.</HI></P>
<P>In Return for the&s;e Services, we recommend him to your Genero&s;ity; and on our own Behalf, we give him <HI>Five Skins</HI> to buy him Clothes and Shoes with.</P>
<P><HI>BRETHREN,</HI></P>
<P>We have &s;till one more Favour to a&s;k. Our Treaty, and all we have to &s;ay about Publick Bu&s;ine&s;s, is now over, and to morrow we de&s;ign to leave you. We hope, as you have given us plenty of good Provi&s;ion whil&s;t in Town, that you will continue your Goodne&s;s &s;o far as to &s;upply us with a little more to &s;erve us on the Road. And we likewi&s;e de&s;ire you will provide us with Waggons, to carry our Goods to the Place where they are to be conveyed by Water.</P></Q>
<P><PB N="24" REF="005216_0024_1017148434E7BB50">
To the&s;e &s;everal Points the Governor made the following Reply.</P>
<Q><P><HI>BRETHREN of the Six Nations,</HI></P>
<P>The Judgment you have ju&s;t now pa&s;s'd on your Cou&s;ins the <HI>Dela|wares,</HI> confirms the high Opinion we have ever entertained of the Ju&s;tice of the <HI>Six Nations.</HI> This Part of your Character, for which you are de&s;ervedly famed, made us waive doing our &s;elves Ju&s;tice, in order to give you another Opportunity of convincing the World of your inviolable Attachment to your Engagements. The&s;e unhappy People might have always liv'd ea&s;y, having never receiv'd the lea&s;t Injury from us; but we believe &s;ome of our own People were bad enough to impo&s;e on their Credulity, and engage them in the&s;e wrong Mea&s;ures, which we with, for their Sakes, they had avoi|ded.</P>
<P>We hoped, from what we have con&s;tantly given in Charge to the Indian Traders, that they would have admini&s;tred no ju&s;t Cau&s;e of Complaint: If they do you Wrong, it is again&s;t our Inclinations, and contrary to our expre&s;s Directions. As you have exhibited no particular Charge again&s;t them, we &s;hall u&s;e our be&s;t Endeavours to per&s;uade them to give you as much for your Skins as they can po&s;&s;ibly afford; and to take Care that their Goods which they give in Exchange for Skins, be of the be&s;t Sort. We will likewi&s;e or|der you &s;ome Rum to &s;erve you on your Journey home, &s;ince you de&s;ire it.</P>
<P>We wi&s;h there had been more Room and better Hou&s;es pro|vided for your Entertainment; but not expecting &s;o many of you, we did the be&s;t we could. 'Tis true there are a great many Hou|&s;es in Town, but as they are the Property of other People, who have their own Families to take Care of, it is difficult to procure Lodgings for a large Number of People, e&s;pecially if they come un|expectedly.</P>
<P>We entertain the &s;ame Sentiments of the Abilities and Probity of the Interpreter as you have expre&s;s'd. We were induc'd at fir&s;t to make u&s;e of him in this important Tru&s;t, from his being known to be agreeable to you, and one who had lived among&s;t you for &s;ome Years, in good Credit and E&s;teem with all your Nations; and have ever found him equally faithful to both. We are pleas'd with the Notice you have taken of him, and think he richly de&s;erves it at your Hands. We &s;hall not be wanting to make him a &s;uitable Gra|tification, for the many good and faithful Services he hath done this Government.</P>
<P>We have already given Orders for Waggons to carry your Goods, and for a Supply of Provi&s;ions to &s;erve you on the Road in your Return home, where we heartily wi&s;h you may arrive in good Health.</P></Q>
<P><PB N="25" REF="005216_0025_10171485C2D09C90">
After the Governor had concluded, Mr. <HI>Logan</HI> return'd an An&s;wer to that Part of <HI>Cana&s;&s;ateego</HI>'s Speech which related to him, and &s;aid, <Q>That not only upon the Account of his Lamene&s;s, of which the Indians them&s;elves were Witne&s;&s;es; but on Account of another Indi&s;po&s;ition which about three Years &s;ince had laid him under an Incapacity of expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf with his former u&s;ual Freedom, he had been obliged to live retired in the Country. But that our fir&s;t Proprietor, the Honourable <HI>William Penn,</HI> who had ever been a Father and true Friend to all the Indians, having above Forty Years &s;ince recommended them to his particular Care, he had always, from his own Inclination as well as from that &s;trict Charge, en|deavoured to convince all the Indians, that He was their true Friend; and was now well plea&s;ed, that after a Tract of &s;o many Years, they were not in&s;en&s;ible of it. He thanked them kindly for their Pre&s;ent, and heartily joined with them in their De&s;ires, that this Government may always be furni&s;hed with Per&s;ons of equally good Inclinations, and not only with &s;uch, but al&s;o with better Abilities to &s;erve them.</Q></P>
<P>And then <HI>Cana&s;&s;atego</HI> &s;aid, he had forgot to mention, that <HI>Shickcalamy</HI> and <HI>Caxbayn</HI> had been employ'd on &s;everal Me&s;&s;ages to this Government, and de&s;ir'd they might be con&s;ider'd on that Account.</P>

<P>And the <HI>Indians</HI> having reque&s;ted that they might have a &s;mall Quantity of Rum, to be added to their Provi&s;ions, to comfort them on the Road: The Board is of Opinion, that there be added to the &s;aid E&s;timate for Twenty Gallons of Rum for the afore&s;aid U&s;e. And in Return for their Pre&s;ent of Skins, at Reque&s;ting that the Indian Traders be enjoyn'd to &s;ell their Goods cheaper, the Board directs that two Strouds be pre&s;ented. And that <HI>Five Pounds</HI> be given to <HI>Caxhayn</HI> on the Account of the Province, for his Services; and to <HI>Shickalamy</HI> the like Sum.</P>
