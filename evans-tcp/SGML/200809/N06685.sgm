<HEAD>THE INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>BY <HI>LIBERTY,</HI> I under&s;tand a Freedom of Spirit to act and &s;peak according to the Light and Conviction received, whether agreeably to the Cu&s;tom of the Land wherein we live, or not. By <HI>Bondage,</HI> I under&s;tand a Want of that Liberty, or a &s;ervile Subjection to the pre|vailing Fa&s;hions of the Times as &s;uch, even when either we believe them to be repugnant to Ju&s;tice and Truth, or neglect to enquire whether they be &s;o or not, altho' &s;trongly called on &s;o to do by the Examples and Precepts of our Forefathers, and the &s;ingular Education they have given us: And according to this Account, I apprehend that tho&s;e whom we commonly call <HI>Libertines</HI> in our Society, ought to be ranked among the <HI>Captives.</HI></P>
<P>In the&s;e Lands, indeed, we are favoured, far be|yond many of our Neighbours, with the Liberty of wor&s;hipping God according to our re&s;pective Per&s;ua&s;ions, and our civil Rights and Liberties are in a great Mea&s;ure &s;ecured to us, and many a|mong us profe&s;s great Zeal to maintain and pre|&s;erve the&s;e inviolable, who yet, in Reality, if they examine them&s;elves impartially, will be found not

a Whit better than <HI>Slaves</HI> to a certain mo&s;t potent Idol, who&s;e Sway is more de&s;potic and more uni|ver&s;al than that of any Monarch upon Earth; that is to &s;ay, the <HI>God or Spirit of this World.</HI></P>
<P>This Addre&s;s comes from one who has long groaned under the Bondage of this Spirit, and who con&s;equently is not void of a Sympathy with &s;uch as may be under the like Circum&s;tances, and wi&s;hes for them the like Redemption and Parti|cipation of the glorious <HI>Liberty of the Sons of God,</HI> after which he him&s;elf a&s;pires.</P>
<P>Now, in the Language of Scripture, <HI>the Spi|rit of this World</HI> is placed in Oppo&s;ition to the Spi|rit of GOD, as in the&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions of the Apo|&s;tle <HI>Paul:</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Cor.</HI> ii. 12.</NOTE> <HI>Now we have received not the Spi|rit of this World, but the Spirit which is of</HI> GOD, <HI>that we might know the Things that are freely given us of</HI> GOD: And again, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 <HI>Cor.</HI> iv 4.</NOTE> <HI>The God of this World blinded the Eyes of tho&s;e from whom the Light of the glorious Go&s;pel was hid</HI> formerly; and <HI>the Children of this World</HI> are di&s;tingui&s;hed from the <HI>Children of Light</HI> by the Lip of Truth <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Luke</HI> xvi. 8.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The View given in this little Tract of the pre|vailing Fa&s;hions of the Lands we live in, affords to me a &s;trong Evidence of the Corruption of the Heart of Man, and that amid&s;t all our Boa&s;ts of Liberty and Reformation, the World &s;till lies in Wickedne&s;s; that many &s;till continue to walk in the broad Way; and that but a Few have learned to walk in that &s;trait Path which leads to Life; and &s;o the Advice of the Apo&s;tle, <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rom.</HI> xii. 2.</NOTE> <HI>Be not con|formed

formed to this World, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your Mind,</HI> remains to be very whole|&s;ome and applicable to us at this Day.</P>
<P>The <HI>Jews</HI> of old boa&s;ted of their being <HI>Abra|ham</HI>'s Children, and in Bondage to no Man, but the Lip of Truth pronounced them Slaves to Sin; and indeed, altho' Chri&s;t our Lord was anointed to preach <HI>Deliverance to the Captives</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Luke</HI> iv.</NOTE>, it is to be doubted that but few who bear his Name have obtained the happy Experience of being entirely &s;et at Liberty from a Va&s;&s;alage to the Spirit of this World; on the contrary, that this Spirit hath captivated and blinded Multitudes of tho&s;e called Chri&s;tians, is too evident in our daily Conver&s;ation, from the enchanting or delu&s;ive Power of the pre|vailing Fa&s;hion of the Times, whereby it gives a fal&s;e Lu&s;tre to many ab&s;urd, hurtful and wicked Practices, and (even as &s;ome called <HI>Evil good</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>I&s;aiah</HI> v. 20.</NOTE>, <HI>and Good evil, and put Darkne&s;s for Light, and Light for Darkne&s;s,</HI> &s;o this) frequently repre&s;ents Wrong for Right, and Right for Wrong, and blinds Men both as to their temporal and &s;piritual Inter|e&s;t; and he that dares to be truly Wi&s;e and Vir|tuous, in Oppo&s;ition to the Torrent of the Times, is commonly the Object of Scorn; in order to a|void which, the Many run down with the Stream.</P>
<P>To &s;hew that this is the Ca&s;e in divers In&s;tan|ces peculiarly affecting our religious Society, is the De&s;ign of this Addre&s;s, and to repre&s;ent to tho&s;e who are proper Objects of this Admonition, the Mi&s;ery and Folly of their pre&s;ent State and Con|duct,

as being incon&s;i&s;tent not only with the Pre|cepts of Holy Scripture, but the Maxims of &s;ound Rea&s;on, and &s;uch as cla&s;h even with their temporal Intere&s;t, and to convince them that they are not only Slaves, but Fools al&s;o, even as long as they hug their Chains, and do not &s;igh and groan for Deliverance.</P>
<P>That there is a gro&s;s and palpable Declen&s;ion among the pre&s;ent Generation of the People cal|led <HI>Quakers,</HI> from the Spirit and Practices of their Predece&s;&s;ors, is abundantly manife&s;t in the &s;everal In&s;tances to be hereafter minutely &s;pecified: Nor indeed to tho&s;e who know how to trace Effects from their Cau&s;es, is this at all to be wondered at, the&s;e Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions being no other than the ge|nuine Productions of the native Soil, the Heart of Man, that hath not been &s;ubjected to the Di&s;|cipline of the Holy Cro&s;s.</P>
<P>To dare to oppo&s;e the modi&s;h Inundation of the Follies and Extravagancies of the Times, re|quires a Fortitude not born with us, but &s;uch as mu&s;t be acquired by no &s;mall Share of &s;piritual Indu&s;try, and indeed a Power more than human.</P>
<P>Wherefore I bow the Knee to the God and Father of Spirits, that he who is Omnipotent, Omnipre&s;ent, and infinitely good, may vouch|&s;afe &s;o far to co-operate with the&s;e my feeble En|deavours, as to enlighten the Under&s;tandings, and bend the Wills of tho&s;e poor Captives to the World's Spirit and Ways, who dare not do other|wi&s;e than run with the Multitude, and that he may influence them to a Way of thinking and acting agreeable to the Examples and Precepts of

their Fathers, even by the Operation of the &s;ame Power and Spirit which animated them in their Chri&s;tian Conflict, being well aware, that nothing &s;hort of the &s;ame Power which rai&s;ed up, can pre&s;erve us a Society to the Glory of GOD, who hath called us, as he did the primitive Chri&s;tians formerly, unto <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gal.</HI> v. 13.</NOTE> <HI>Liberty.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean time, as I am here treating with meer carnal Men, who are no otherwi&s;e <HI>Quakers</HI> than by meer Accident, and rather indeed by Re|luctance than Choice, who have little or no Re|li&s;h for the &s;ublime Truths of the Go&s;pel, who vainly flatter them&s;elves with the Conceit of Li|berty, good Sen&s;e, the free Exerci&s;e of their ra|tional Faculties, and ju&s;t Apprehen&s;ions of their own temporal Intere&s;t and Honour, I &s;hall en|deavour to rea&s;on with them upon their own Prin|ciples, even as Babes are to be fed with Milk, be|ing unable to bear &s;tronger Meat: For indeed, if one were to &s;peak to &s;uch meerly of Self-denial and Mortification, or of the glorious Privileges of the <HI>free</HI> Citizens of the <HI>New-Jeru&s;alem,</HI> or of the Vanity of all worldly Enjoyments, or of the Joys of Heaven, re&s;erved for tho&s;e who bear the Cro&s;s here; or were one to affirm, with great Truth, that this People with whom they profe&s;s Fellow&s;hip, are &s;ignalized by two &s;pecial Marks of the Favour of Divine Providence, <HI>viz.</HI> in the rai&s;ing up a Mini&s;try agreeable to Chri&s;t's own Ap|pointment, and in e&s;tabli&s;hing Chri&s;tian Di&s;cipline among us, it is very probable he might meet with no better Treatment than that which <HI>Felix</HI> the

<P>But if one &s;peak to them, of Liberty, and of temporal Honour and Intere&s;t, and of the Con|&s;i&s;tency of their Conduct with &s;ound Rea&s;on and good Sen&s;e, they may, perhaps, vouch&s;afe to lend an Ear; for which Rea&s;on the chief Tendency of this Work is to &s;hew them that their Conduct is neither con&s;i&s;tent with Liberty, &s;ound Policy and good Sen&s;e, nor with their own temporal Honour and Intere&s;t; and if once the &s;andy Foundation upon which they have been building comes to be &s;haken, they may po&s;&s;ibly think of digging deeper for a better, which is what hath been very fre|quently, earne&s;tly and ju&s;tly recommended to them by our Brethren of the Mini&s;try.</P>
<P>And indeed it mu&s;t be owned, that a meer Conformity to the Traditions of the Elders in ex|terior Matters, is far from entitling any Man to the Kingdom of Heaven, and &s;o is every Thing &s;hort of <HI>Regeneration</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>John</HI> iii.</NOTE>, according to our Lord's Doctrine, and be&s;ides a <HI>Non-conformity to this World,</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rom.</HI> xii. 2.</NOTE> we mu&s;t be <HI>transformed by the Renewing of our Mind,</HI> agreeably to the Precept of the Apo&s;tle.</P>
<P>In the mean time, it will abundantly appear in the Sequel, that our Ance&s;tors have pointed out to us the plain high Road to Health, Tran|quility of Mind, and the Pre&s;ervation, if not In|crea&s;e, of our outward E&s;tates.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="008486_0008_102F5B97DCA89BE0">It was not however the Policy of this World, or a meer Principle of Par&s;imony that led them into the&s;e Things, but a clear Illumination of Mind, by which they &s;aw the Vanity, Folly and Wickedne&s;s of the World in many of their Prac|tices, and therefore con&s;cientiou&s;ly declined them, and as now at length, thro' the per&s;evering Con|&s;tancy of the Faithful, thro' a con&s;iderable Se|ries of Time, the Prejudices of the People are in a great Mea&s;ure overcome, and many &s;ober Per|&s;ons of other Societies begin to be convinced of the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of many of our Practices, and even to recommend them as mo&s;t con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;tricte&s;t Ju&s;tice and Prudence, the pre&s;ent reigning Degeneracy of tho&s;e who are yet called by our Name, becomes very un&s;ea&s;onable, and, like the Conduct of the Spies of old, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Numbers</HI> xiii.</NOTE> who brought up an evil Report of the Land of <HI>Ca|naan,</HI> tends to di&s;courage the Progre&s;s of the Re|formation, or the Spreading of that Light and Truth which, thro' the Favour of Providence, hath dawned among us.</P>
<P>That Purity and Simplicity of Manners, con|&s;i&s;ting in the Renounciation of the Superfluities and Vanities of the World, by which our Elders were, and the Faithful &s;till are, di&s;tingui&s;hed, was no affected Singularity, nor was it any other than the Re&s;ult of a Conformity to the Doctrine and Precepts of Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles, and perfectly agreeable to the Idea given us in the New-Te&s;ta|ment, of the E&s;timate proper to be made of the State of Man in this World as a tran&s;ient Habita|tion,

<P>But, in the mean time, I do not apprehend that this di&s;charges either Parents from a Vigi|lance over their Children, or Elders from an O|ver&s;ight of the Flock, in re&s;pect to the&s;e exterior Matters.</P>
<P>As to the New Birth, and the Gift of Faith, it is not in the Power of the Parent to convey the&s;e to his Children, but yet this &s;hould not hinder him from conveying to them what he can.</P>

<P>Shall a Parent thus &s;ituated abandon his Off|&s;pring during a State of Minority, Ignorance and Weakne&s;s, to Nature, or to corrupt Company, and if viciou&s;ly inclined (as indeed the Seeds of

Evil &s;oon appear even in Children) put no Yoke, or lay no Re&s;traint, and exerci&s;e no Di&s;cipline on him in his Youth? This would be a Neglect con|demned by all wi&s;e Nations; and, on the contra|ry, it is allowed to be the indi&s;pen&s;ible Duty of Parents to train up their Children in the Way wherein they ought hereafter to walk, to recom|mend to them the Sweetne&s;s of Virtue, and keep them out of the Road to Vice as much as po&s;&s;i|ble, by In&s;tructions, by Example, by Encourage|ments, and Re&s;traints properly exerci&s;ed: By this Means, in the more tractable Di&s;po&s;itions, the Practice of Virtue will become familiar, or at lea&s;t good Habits will be contracted, and our Youth will be kept out of the Way of tho&s;e ma|ny Temptations which daily captivate the giddy Multitude, and they will be more capable of bet|ter and higher Impre&s;&s;ions, than if, by an early Indulgence of a Conformity to the modi&s;h Cor|ruptions of a degenerate Age, evil Habits had been contracted, very difficult to be afterwards o|vercome.</P>
<P>Now if &s;uch be the Duty of Parents with Re|gard to their Offspring, undoubtedly Mini&s;ters and Elders ought to countenance and co-operate with the&s;e Endeavours, tho&s;e e&s;pecially whom the <HI>Ho|ly Gho&s;t</HI> hath now, as formerly, made <HI>Over&s;eers,</HI> not neglecting to recommend higher and nobler Principles of Action than meer Education and Tradition; and when the Religion of our Edu|cation becomes the Religion of our Judgment and Choice; when we, and tho&s;e of the &s;ucceeding Ages, become thoroughly convinced that a faith|ful

<P>We are indeed &s;till di&s;tingui&s;hed from our Neighbours by a peculiar Simplicity in our Garb, but notwith&s;tanding all the Precepts that have been given forth to the contrary, an Affectation of the Ways of the World frequently betrays it&s;elf among many of our Profe&s;&s;ion: It is true, Gold and Silver Lace have not as yet found Admittance, but the &s;ame Thing cannot be affirmed of &s;plen|did Ribbons, and &s;ome other Things, which of

<P>Before I di&s;mi&s;s the Con&s;ideration of Superflu|ity in Apparel, I &s;hall con&s;ider one gro&s;s and pal|pable In&s;tance thereof, <HI>viz.</HI> that Di&s;tinction of Habit which is u&s;ed by &s;ome as a Token of <HI>Mourn|ing for the Dead,</HI> a Cu&s;tom of no more U&s;e to the Dead, than tho&s;e Garlands with which &s;ome affect to adorn their Graves, and a &s;uperfluous Expence and Burthen on the Living, even on &s;uch who dare not do otherwi&s;e than &s;ubmit to the Ordinances of that Idol, Fa&s;hion, although many of the thinking Part of them, would be very glad of &s;uch a Privilege of an Exemption from it as we by Virtue of our Education enjoy.</P>
<P>Wherefore, that any under our Profe&s;&s;ion &s;hould manife&s;t a &s;trong Di&s;po&s;ition to creep into this Practice; betrays both great Stupidity, and want of a Sen&s;e of the Value of the Liberty purcha&s;ed for them by their Ance&s;tors, and at the &s;ame time a &s;lavi&s;h Subjection to the Spirit of the World, the Folly of which is peculiarly aggravated by its being voluntary, and of their own choo&s;ing.</P>
<P>Such, who fall into this mean Compliance, dare not &s;ay, that it proceeds from a greater De|gree of Affection they have for their decea&s;ed Re|lations, than the&s;e had for theirs, whil&s;t they ne|ver wore this Mark of Sorrow: And if it be &s;up|po&s;ed

<P>It is, moreover, an Appearance at this Juncture particularly un&s;ea&s;onable, even when judicious Per&s;ons of other Societies are groaning under, and &s;ome of them ridiculing the vain and &s;uperfluous Pomps attending Funerals, and tends to era&s;e and de&s;troy the good Impre&s;&s;ions which, by our Means, might otherwi&s;e be made on the more thinking and impartial Ob&s;ervers, &s;o that &s;uch, who thus deviate from the Simplicity proper to their Profe&s;|&s;ion in this Re&s;pect, may be deemed a Kind of dark Lanthorns, tending to &s;top the Progre&s;s of the Light of Reformation: And this al&s;o, in com|mon with many other In&s;tances of Degeneracy from the primitive Example, tends to outward Poverty; and the&s;e Con&s;equences are chargeable chiefly on the Rich and Great, as Fa&s;hion-mak|ers, whom the lower Ranks are very prone blind|ly to follow, tho' in Oppo&s;ition to their own In|tere&s;t.</P>

<P>The above mentioned Author reprehends the modern Profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity, as widely de|viating from the Simplicity of the more early Ages, both among Jews, Heathens and Chri&s;tians, who were never wont to di&s;tingui&s;h their Saints and Heroes by the Title of Lord, as Lord <HI>Noah,</HI> Lord <HI>Daniel,</HI> Lord <HI>Peter,</HI> Lord <HI>Paul,</HI> Lord <HI>So|lon,</HI> Lord <HI>Cato, &amp;c.</HI> whil&s;t we are very lavi&s;h in be&s;towing not only the&s;e, but many other &s;plen|did Epithets, &s;uch as <HI>your Excellency,</HI> your <HI>Grace, Honourable,</HI> and <HI>Right Honourable, Wor&s;hipful, &amp;c.</HI> re&s;pectively appropriated to certain Per&s;ons among us by a licentious U&s;e of Speech, from no better Authority than that of the Cu&s;tom of the Coun|try, without con&s;idering whether the&s;e Titles be ju&s;tly given or no, or whether to Per&s;ons real|ly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the Qualities a&s;cribed to them, or not: And he that refu&s;eth to give the&s;e Titles is deemed &s;queami&s;h or &s;uper&s;titious, notwith&s;tand|ing that the inviolable Rules of &s;ound Morality, as well as the Precepts of Scripture <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ephe&s;.</HI> iv. 25.</NOTE>, enjoin eve|ry Man to <HI>put away Lying, and &s;peak the Truth to his Neighbour.</HI></P>

<P>In the&s;e Countries, indeed, Kings, and even Bi&s;hops, mu&s;t be approached on the Knee, which is no better than a confounding, or making no Difference between, the outward Marks of Re|verence paid unto mortal Man, and which were ever, both under the Old and New Te&s;tament, paid unto Almighty GOD, and who indeed hath expre&s;ly appropriated this outward Mark of Adora|tion and Submi&s;&s;ion to him&s;elf, in the following Texts: <HI>Unto me every Knee &s;hall bow</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>I&s;aiah</HI> xlv. 23.8, 10, 11.</NOTE>. <HI>As I</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rom.</HI> xiv, 11. <HI>Philip.</HI> ii. 5, 6&punc;</NOTE> <HI>live, &s;aith the Lord, every Knee &s;hall bow to me.

<P>The like may be &s;aid concerning <HI>uncovering the Head,</HI> in Te&s;timony of Re&s;pect to mortal Man, an Appearance ever deemed proper to the Exer|ci&s;e of public divine Wor&s;hip, or of the &s;piritu|al Gifts of Praying, [and Prophe&s;ying or Preach|ing in the Church] even from the Days of the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xi.</NOTE> unto this Time.</P>

<P>And &s;ince our Forefathers, by their Con&s;tancy and Per&s;everance in this In&s;tance of Self-denial, have &s;o far wearied out the Spirit of Oppo&s;ition and Per&s;ecution, which had been rai&s;ed on the&s;e Occa&s;ions, as to have rendered the &s;ame Sort of Conduct ea&s;y to us their Succe&s;&s;ors, what but a &s;lavi&s;h Subjection to the ill grounded Maxims and Spirit of this World, is the Cau&s;e that induces a|ny under our Denomination, who have been &s;o taught, and &s;o believed, to mean Compliances in the&s;e Re&s;pects?</P>
<P>But, to return to the U&s;e of <HI>flattering Titles;</HI> it &s;eems ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to take Notice of one of tho&s;e which is the mo&s;t common, and &s;uch as mo&s;t frequently occurs in the daily Addre&s;&s;es of almo&s;t all Mankind to one another in the&s;e Coun|tries, where Cu&s;tom has ordained that we mu&s;t not ordinarily acco&s;t, nor &s;peak of, or to, any one, whether he be our Superior, or our Equal, or perhaps our Inferior, by his di&s;tingui&s;hing Name of <HI>John, Thomas, &amp;c.</HI> without annexing to it &s;ome Title of Ma&s;ter&s;hip, Dominion or Lord&s;hip, <HI>viz.</HI> tho&s;e of <HI>Ma&s;ter, Mi&s;tre&s;s, Sir,</HI> or <HI>Madam,</HI>

or rather <HI>Ma Dame, i. e.</HI> My Lady, this la&s;t Term being borrowed from the <HI>French</HI> (a Nation far more di&s;tingui&s;hed by their Affectation of Compliments, than by their Sincerity) whom we are too fond of imitating; nor in Writing, con|clude our Letters, without &s;ub&s;cribing our&s;elves <HI>Humble Servants</HI> to the Per&s;on to whom we write; and indeed &s;uch is the enchanting Power of the Spirit of this World in this Ca&s;e, that it frequent|ly proves, in common Conver&s;ation, no &s;mall De|gree of Self-denial, to adhere to the Simplicity of calling every one by their di&s;tingui&s;hing Name, without annexing one of the&s;e flattering Epithets to it; and accordingly great Numbers of tho&s;e who bear our Name are daily, in this In&s;tance al|&s;o, betrayed and &s;hamed into mean Compliances; or, in other Terms, a &s;ervile Subjection to the Spi|rit and Maxims of a depraved Age.</P>
<P>For indeed, how minute and trivial &s;oever this Affair may appear to &s;ome, and how much &s;oe|ver long e&s;tabli&s;hed Cu&s;tom may &s;eem to have given a Sanction to this Licentiou&s;ne&s;s in Speech, Cu&s;tom can never alter the Nature of Things, or render that to be Truth which is Fal&s;hood, or make it ju&s;t to call him Ma&s;ter, who is not &s;uch.</P>

<P>The Conclu&s;ion therefore is clear, that when any of us (who are thus convinced, not by meer Tradition, but by the Rea&s;ons on which the Tra|dition is founded) fall into the Practice of the World in this Ca&s;e, it is an Evidence that our Souls are yet in Bondage to the Spirit of this World, who&s;e fal&s;e Maxims we want Courage and Hone&s;ty to contradict.</P>
<P>Another &s;trong In&s;tance of the de&s;potic Sway of that Idol, <HI>Fa&s;hion,</HI> and than which a &s;tronger can hardly be given, is that ab&s;urd Innovation in our Language, which now almo&s;t univer&s;ally pre|vails, <HI>viz.</HI> that no &s;ingle Per&s;on mu&s;t be acco&s;ted but by a Term originally and properly expre&s;&s;ive of more than One; &s;o that, as the Edicts of Princes are commonly given forth in the fir&s;t Per|&s;on plural, in the Terms, <HI>We</HI> command, and <HI>Our</HI> royal Plea&s;ure is, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the like Air of Grandeur mu&s;t al&s;o be transferred to private Per&s;ons, in the
<PB N="49" REF="008486_0047_102F5C0165712CB0">
U&s;e of the &s;econd Per&s;on plural, in&s;tead of the &s;econd Per&s;on &s;ingular; and &s;o far e&s;tabli&s;hed is this Cu&s;tom, in this Age of boa&s;ted Potitene&s;s, that he who dares to decline it, is liable to be deemed either a meer Clown, or ridiculou&s;ly &s;queami&s;h and &s;uper&s;titious.</P>
<P>And, indeed, I make no Scruple of acknow|ledging, that the Cu&s;tom of the Country we live in, where it neither cla&s;hes with the Rules of good Sen&s;e, nor Virtue, ought &s;carcely to be de|parted from, and that affected Singularities, in Speech or Manners, are rather an Evidence of Pride, than of Chri&s;tian Virtue; but if the Cu|&s;tom be &s;uch as does not an&s;wer the ju&s;t Ends of Speech, but tends to introduce Ambiguity or Con|fu&s;ion into our Language, or if it has been not only originally introduced, but is &s;till &s;upported by the Pride and Vanity of Man, then the declin|ing of &s;uch a Cu&s;tom, from &s;uch a Per&s;ua&s;ion, becomes an In&s;tance of Self-denial and Chri&s;tian Courage, even in daring to oppo&s;e the e&s;tabli&s;hed Fa&s;hion of a mi&s;taken and depraved Age.</P>
<P>Now, that this is really the Ca&s;e with re&s;pect to the U&s;e of the Word <HI>You,</HI> as applied to a &s;in|gle Per&s;on, is evident from the Confu&s;ion of the &s;ingular and plural Number thereby made, and its Tendency to rob our Language of the Pro|nouns <HI>Thou</HI> and <HI>Thee,</HI> peculiarly and di&s;tingui&s;h|ingly expre&s;&s;ive of the &s;ingular Number, whil&s;t the Word <HI>You</HI> is equivocal, and, according to the modern Corruption, equally applicable to <HI>One,</HI> and to more than one, a Licentiou&s;ne&s;s of Speech, in|con&s;i&s;tent with the De&s;ign thereof.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="008486_0048_102F5C06475F67C8">And moreover, that this Corruption of Speech hath been &s;upported by the Pride of vain Man, appears from the rough and harm Treatment our Forefathers at fir&s;t met with, on Account of their Adherence to the U&s;e of the Words <HI>Thou</HI> and <HI>Thee,</HI> whil&s;t at the &s;ame time it was univer&s;ally acknowledged, that the U&s;e of tho&s;e Words was mo&s;t con&s;i&s;tent with the awful Solemnity and Re|verence proper to our Addre&s;&s;es to Almighty GOD; and accordingly they are retained in the e&s;tabli&s;h|ed Forms of Prayer; and yet an Inferior, or a Beggar might be, and &s;till is, frequently thus ac|co&s;ted, but the acco&s;ting of an Equal or Superi|or in this Manner, was, and &s;till is, by many deemed Rudene&s;s, and accordingly was frequent|ly an&s;wered by contemptuous Speeches and Re|proaches, a &s;ure Te&s;t of that Pride and Vanity which ought not to be gratified, but humbled, and than which indeed &s;carce any Thing can be more ab&s;urd, even that Men &s;hould re&s;ent, as an Indignity, their being addre&s;&s;ed in that very Lan|guage, in which they them&s;elves addre&s;s the great Sovereign of the Univer&s;e.</P>
<P>Such were and are the Sentiments and De|meanour of our Ance&s;tors, and all their faithful Succe&s;&s;ors; and &s;uch are the Grounds of our Sin|gularity in this Ca&s;e: Wherefore, the mean Com|pliances which of later Days have greatly pre|vailed among tho&s;e who otherwi&s;e profe&s;s them|&s;elves to be of our Community, who vary their Language according to their Company, and are a&s;hamed to acco&s;t Strangers according to the pri|mitive Simplicity; are Evidences of a Servility

<P>Some, in Excu&s;e for the Prevalence of this Impropriety in Speech, have alledged, that it has been &s;o long e&s;tabli&s;hed by Cu&s;tom, and the Ex|ample of their Parents and A&s;&s;ociates, that &s;ome may be &s;uppo&s;ed not to know the Difference, which indeed is an Argument that a long conti|nued Cu&s;tom may e&s;tabli&s;h a Corruption in Speech; but that it ought &s;o to do, is utterly contrary to the whole Tenour of our Profe&s;&s;ion, in other ob|vious In&s;tances, as well as what we condemn in our Neighbours, in their U&s;e of the Word <HI>You,</HI> who therefore have accordingly retorted our Ar|gument upon us, <HI>viz.</HI> that we our&s;elves al&s;o are guilty of an equal Impropriety, in &s;ub&s;tituting <HI>Thee</HI> for <HI>Thou,</HI> and from the &s;ame Principle which we condemn in them, <HI>viz.</HI> an imaginary &s;uperi|or Softne&s;s of the Term <HI>Thee;</HI> and indeed I con|fe&s;s, I know of no effectual An&s;wer to this Ob|jection, but mending our Conduct accordingly.</P>
<P>But I cannot yet be per&s;uaded, that meer Ig|norance is the Cau&s;e of this Incon&s;i&s;tency of Speech peculiar to us; for even our Gramma|rians and Scholars (to their peculiar Shame be it &s;aid) are frequently as guilty of it, as tho&s;e who are ignorant of the Rules of Grammar; and, moreover, it is ob&s;ervable, that divers of tho&s;e, who decline the U&s;e of the Word <HI>Thou</HI> in their Conver&s;ation, do yet in their Letters and Writ|ings (where there is more Room for Delibera|tion, and le&s;s Shame of the Cro&s;s, than in Conver|&s;ation)
