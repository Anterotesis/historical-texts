<P><HI>THE Authors of the en&s;uing Di&s;cour&s;es think proper to ap|pri&s;e the world, that their appearance is in compliance with the de&s;ires of tho&s;e, to whom they could deny nothing of this na|ture. And as they contain nothing injurious to tho&s;e who&s;e concerns lie in</HI> peace <HI>and</HI> truth, <HI>they are the more readily prevailed upon to comply with their reque&s;t. How they may be received, they can|not &s;ay. They have no rea&s;on, however, con&s;idering the preju|dices of mankind, to expect that they will meet with general re|ception; much le&s;s, with general approbation. Should any be of|fended at their contents, they wi&s;h them to remember, that not the</HI> per&s;ons, <HI>but the</HI> ERRORS <HI>and</HI> INIQUITIES <HI>of men, are expo&s;ed. The Author of the former could have &s;aid much more upon the &s;ubject, but he forbore, (Jude</HI> 9.<HI>) for he is per&s;uaded more is &s;aid than will be well received.</HI>&mdash;<HI>The &s;ub&s;tance of both Di&s;cour&s;es is here exhibited. The Authors, however, think them&s;elves ju&s;tified, in &s;ometimes changing the phra&s;eology, and adding an illu&s;trative &s;entence; though this is but &s;paringly done, as tho&s;e who heard them attentively will find.</HI>&mdash;<HI>Should any find them&s;elves &s;timulated to take public notice of them, they need not expect the Authors to make any reply, except they advance &s;omething</HI> new <HI>upon the &s;ub|ject: for they are per&s;uaded, that the objections to the&s;e doctrines, that have hitherto tran&s;pired, have been &s;ufficiently refuted by learned and judicious pens. Con&s;cious of the pure&s;t motives&mdash;un|awed by the fear of being accounted &s;ingular, and prompted by a generous zeal for the honour of their</HI> GREAT REDEEMER <HI>and the intere&s;ts of his &s;piritual kingdom,</HI>&mdash;<HI>they chearfully commit the&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es to the in&s;pection of the Public.</HI></P>

<BIBL>JOHN xiv. 15.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>If ye love Me, keep my Commandments.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>"GOD is love."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 John iv. 8.</NOTE> From this inexhau&s;tible fountain, through the &s;acred channel of Emmanuel's mediati|on, are all the ble&s;&s;ings of our &s;alvation derived. And, "unto the place from whence the rivers" of &s;overeign mer|cy "come, thither they return,"<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eccl. i. 7.</NOTE> in all pure affections and holy obedience to the commandments of Zion's King. To keep his commandments, we are here informed, is the only evidence of our having partaken of his grace. To give this evidence, whatever difficulties may lie in the way, the lea&s;t of his &s;aints are required. And in the performance of it, whatever may be their inward weakne&s;s, and how formida|ble &s;o ever their external foes, yet are they not to be di&s;cou|raged. "The brui&s;ed reed he will not break, and the &s;moak|ing flax <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> not quench."<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Matt. xii. 20.</NOTE> For, when he &s;ends try|ing di&s;pen&s;ations to his dear children, he is plea&s;ed to favour them with grace to &s;u&s;tain the load. Yea, more, he takes them and all their concerns upon his Divine &s;houlders. "The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath thee are the everla&s;ting arms."<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Deut. xxxiii. 27.</NOTE> He is plea&s;ed, from time to time, to &s;mile upon them, and embraceth them with his mercy and goodne&s;s on every &s;ide. And thus, whil&s;t the God of their &s;alvation cau&s;es his face to &s;hine upon them, unbo&s;oms him|&s;elf to them, and opens unto them the inexhau&s;tible trea&s;ures of his grace, as their afflictions abound, their con&s;olations do much more abound. Forever ble&s;&s;ed be his glorious Name, he never leaves his people <HI>wholly</HI> comfortle&s;s.</P>
<P>And, O how ineffably delightful and reviving is it, to the truly gracious &s;oul, to hear the &s;ounding of his bowels, mer|cies, and marvellous loving kindne&s;s!&mdash;Then, O then, the
<PB N="8" REF="022146_0006_0FB6FCB4E9EFA438">
heart is pliant and flexible like melted wax, and its language is, "Speak, Lord, for thy &s;ervant heareth." "If ye love me," &s;ays Chri&s;t, "keep my commandments." The graci|ous &s;oul replies, 'Lord, thou knowe&s;t all things, thou know|e&s;t that I love thee, and being, by rich, free, and &s;overeign grace, one of tho&s;e redeemed by thy mo&s;t precious blood, and plucked as a brand out of the fire, I de&s;ire to be found among&s;t tho&s;e who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Je&s;us.'</P>
<P>The text I have &s;elected upon this occa&s;ion, is the words of King Je&s;us, our adorable Redeemer, which are a part of his divine, incomparable, and unparalleled <HI>Farewell-Sermon</HI> to his beloved di&s;ciples. What a holy flame of love mu&s;t have glowed in the hearts of this &s;elect company, when they were hanging upon their dear Redeemer's lips, and attending, with great eagerne&s;s, to the gracious accents, which &s;weetly dropped from the mouth of Him, "who &s;poke as never man &s;pake!"&mdash;and that at a period too, when he was going to leave, as to his bodily pre&s;ence, this little tender flock of his.</P>
<P>The Lord Je&s;us, the glorious King, &s;et upon the holy hill of Zion, fore&s;eeing, I apprehend, (for known unto God are all things from eternity) the various corruptions and inno|vations which would obtain, or take place in future times, embraceth this opportunity of inculcating a careful and uni|ver&s;al ob&s;ervation of his loving commands up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> his di&s;ciples, as the only evidence of love to his &s;acred per&s;on, as the di&s;|tingui&s;hing characteri&s;tic of true di&s;ciple&s;hip: That they be|ing now peculiarly affected with an account of his departure, might come from under his divine di&s;cour&s;e, like a &s;heet from the pre&s;s, with all the &s;tamps and lively impre&s;&s;ions of the truths they heard, and the commands enjoined them, deeply and <HI>indelibly</HI> engraven upon their hearts. And, doubt|le&s;s, all tho&s;e who love the Lord Je&s;us, in &s;incerity, will keep all his commandments, according to the mea&s;ure, not of gifts, but of grace received; for his "love con&s;traineth us." And love is a very powerful principle.</P>
<P>The words before us, naturally, re&s;olve them&s;elves into two branches:
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. A &s;uppo&s;ition, or hypothe&s;is,&mdash;"If ye love Me."</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. A loving command, or kind exhortation,&mdash;"Keep my commandments."</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Whil&s;t we are further meditating upon the&s;e words, pro|nounced by the gracious King of Zion, may we, under the
<PB N="6" REF="022146_0007_0FB6FCBDD6791128">
kind and powerful influences of his ble&s;&s;ed Spirit, experience our too contracted hearts expanding abundantly, in love to Chri&s;t; the breadth and length, and depth and height, of who&s;e amazing love to the children of Zion, &s;urpa&s;s their utmo&s;t knowledge; that we may be filled with all the ful|ne&s;s of God, and, having our hearts enlarged, may run the way of his commandments.</P>
<P>I. A &s;uppo&s;ition,&mdash;"If ye love me." We are not, I pre&s;ume, to under&s;tand our Redeemer, as que&s;tioning whe|ther, or not, his Apo&s;tles loved him. This he well knew. But he &s;peaks hypothetically here, in order to put them, and others, who con&s;ider them&s;elves as his di&s;ciples, upon &s;elf-examination&punc; that being a&s;&s;ured of this matter, they may be &s;timulated to ob&s;erve his precepts.</P>
<P>In order to perceive how far we are intere&s;ted in this mat|ter, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ider, who they are that love the Redeemer, and in what re&s;pects he is loved by them, and appears lovely in their eyes.</P>
<P>FIRST. Concerning tho&s;e who love the Redeemer. The Apo&s;tle declares, "If any man love not the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, let him be <HI>Anathema Maranatha.</HI>"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xvi. 22.</NOTE> What <HI>awful</HI> words are the&s;e! And yet, however &s;trange the a&s;&s;ertion may appear to &s;ome, it is an undeniable truth, that there is not, naturally, a &s;ingle &s;park of true love to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in any &s;oul born in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">orld. For, in con&s;equence of Adam's tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> whom we all &s;inned," every one comes into this vale of tears, carnal, yea wholly &s;o: "I was &s;hapen in iniquity, and in &s;in did my mother conceive me:"<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. li. 5.</NOTE> &s;o that "every imagination of the thoughts of man's heart is evil, only evil, and that continually." Now, "the carnal mind is enmity again&s;t God," yea, <HI>enmity it&s;elf</HI> again&s;t the Lord, and again&s;t his Anointed.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 7. <GAP DESC="foreign"> being an ab&s;tract, noun, is very emphatic.</NOTE> An awful picture this, indeed! and yet, who&s;oever thou art, that reade&s;t or heare&s;t the&s;e words, "Thou art (by nature) the <HI>very man.</HI>"</P>
<P>How then, is any &s;oul brought to love the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t? The Apo&s;tle &s;olves the que&s;tion at once. "We love him," &s;ays the beloved di&s;ciple, "becau&s;e he fir&s;t loved us."<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">1 John iv. 19.</NOTE> He loved his cho&s;en ones, from everla&s;ting, with a free and &s;overeign love; not on account of fore&s;een faith, holine&s;s, or good works,&mdash;for the&s;e are the <HI>effects,</HI> and not the
<PB N="10" REF="022146_0008_0FB6FCC0D18FA6B8">
<HI>cau&s;e,</HI> of his love: He pitched his love on whom he plea&s;ed, and the&s;e he loved, <HI>becau&s;e</HI> he <HI>would</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Deut. vii. 7,8.</NOTE> love them. Before the foundation of the world, Je&s;us, our Lord and our God, "was rejoicing in the habitable parts of the earth, and his delights were with the &s;ons of men." And, in the fulne&s;s of time, according to covenant tran&s;actions in the everla&s;t|ing council of peace, "having made peace by the blood of his cro&s;s," and &s;lain the law-enmity thereby; at the <HI>&s;et time</HI> to favour his cho&s;en, by his word and Spirit, he &s;lays the natural enmity of their minds, by manife&s;ting his love to them, and &s;hedding it abroad in their hearts, by the Holy Gho&s;t given unto them.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. v. 10.</NOTE> He wins them over to him&s;elf, by the power of divine grace. He overcomes them, as one beautifully expre&s;&s;eth it, 'by a &s;weet omnipotence and an omnipotent &s;weetne&s;s,' and makes them willing to come un|to him, in the day of his power. He draws and attracts them, magnet-like, in heart and affections, to his ble&s;&s;ed Self. Then the language of the heart is, "Draw me, O lovely Je&s;us, and we (the affections) will run after thee." This divine change taking place in the &s;oul, in regeneration, Chri&s;t, who, before, &s;eemed to have no form, beauty, or come|line&s;s, why he &s;hould be de&s;ired, becomes now the &s;upreme de&s;ire of his people's &s;ouls. "As the hart panteth after the water brooks" &s;o their &s;ouls pant after Chri&s;t, and his reviv|ing and &s;weetly refre&s;hing waters of life, joy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;olation.

H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ICCO MAMETTAKKIM; VECULLO MAHHA|MADDIM. It is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s the original con&s;truction, and &s;trength of &s;ignification.

Of &s;uch &s;ouls as the&s;e it may be truly &s;aid, "The darkne&s;s is pa&s;t, and the true light <HI>now</HI> &s;hineth. For God, who commanded the light to &s;hine out of darkne&s;s, hath &s;hined in <HI>their</HI> hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Je&s;us Chri&s;t." The "DAY-SPRING from on high hath vi&s;ited them," and they are made "light in the Lord."</P>
<P>Hence it appears, that they who love the Redeemer, are

&s;uch as are born again, called by divine grace, and captivated with his &s;acred excellencies.&mdash;They are the objects of his love, the purcha&s;e of his blood, and the workman&s;hip of his Spirit.&mdash;We come now,</P>
<P>SECONDLY. To enquire, in what point of view, and un|der what con&s;iderations, this glorious object of the &s;aints' e&s;teem, is &s;o lovely in their eyes. And</P>

<P>Having laid before you a little of the loveline&s;s of Je&s;us, in that point of view, in which he is loved by his di&s;ciples, I may, with &s;ingular propriety, adopt the language of Sheba's queen, when &s;he had been entertained with the wi&s;dom of I&s;rael's &s;apient king; Behold, the one half of his greatne&s;s, beauty, and loveline&s;s&punc; has not been told you; for he exceed|eth, yea, infinitely tran&s;cendeth, all that ever hath, or ever

<P>II. To con&s;ider the import of this &s;acred injunction, which is built upon the hypothe&s;is of love to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, "Keep my commandments."</P>

<P>Nor are the <HI>ten words,</HI> or commandments which God gave by Mo&s;es to the children of I&s;rael, commonly called the moral <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> intended.

The &s;oul that &s;inneth, it &s;hall die. The wages of &s;in is death." But be|lievers are delivered from the law as a covenant of works, having fled through divine grace to Chri&s;t, "who is the end,"&punc; the fulfilling end "of the law for righteou&s;ne&s;s to eve|ry one that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">lieveth."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gal. iii. 10.

<P N="5">5. The ordinance of the Lord's Supper, as admini&s;tered in this community, is liable to &s;imilar objections. For, 1. The per&s;ons admitted to the communion, are all the pari&s;h, who are required to communicate three times a-year.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rubric,</HI> end of the Common Service.</NOTE> And it is notorious to all &s;ober people, that the far greater part of the&s;e are incapable of di&s;cerning the Lord's body, and have neither part nor lot in this matter. And, &s;uppo&s;e a mini|&s;ter &s;hould deny the communion to a common drunkard, or a profane &s;wearer, he would find him&s;elf in a perilous ca&s;e.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Are there not &s;ome churches, at which many receive the com|munion, on Ea&s;ter-day, who will be drunk on the &s;ame day, and, perhaps quarrelling too, before they arrive at home?&mdash;<HI>Mon&s;trum! borrendum!</HI></NOTE>&mdash;2. It appears to be a &s;hameful profanation of this or|dinance,
<PB N="21" REF="022146_0019_0FB6FCE277CC5510">
to make it a te&s;t of obedience in civil things, and the receiving of it an indi&s;pen&s;able qualification for holding places under the government.&mdash;3. As it is an ordinance of a public nature, it &s;eems quite wroung to admini&s;ter it in private, to the &s;ick, after the popi&s;h manner, as if it were a <HI>viaticum,</HI> i. e. a pa&s;&s;port for Heaven.&mdash;4. As I embrace the doctrine of particular redemption, I cannot, in con&s;ci|ence, declare concerning every individual, that may be pre|&s;ent at this ordinance, "the body of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t&mdash;was given for <HI>thee,</HI>" &amp;c.&mdash;"The blood of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, was given for <HI>thee,</HI>" &amp;c. &s;ince many may come here, who are wholly <HI>de&s;titute</HI> of true faith, as well as licentious in their lives.</P>
<P N="6">6. In the churching of women, as it is called, there is no &s;ufficient ground, in the lives of many, to con&s;ider them as the &s;ervants of the Lord, in a &s;olemn addre&s;s to the Almigh|ty; nor can I &s;ee how bearing a child can con&s;titute a wo|man a proper &s;ubject for the Lord's Supper, as the rubric directs;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thank, of wom. &amp;c. and Rubric, in <HI>ult.</HI>&mdash;Credat Judaeus apella.

<P N="7">7. Once more: In the burial of the dead, I cannot &s;ee that Chri&s;tian charity will admit <HI>believing mini&s;ters and people,</HI> with pure con&s;ciences, to call every man or woman, <HI>our dear brother,</HI> or <HI>our dear &s;i&s;ter;</HI> &s;ince it is notorious that many who have lived the mo&s;t abandoned lives, die without any appearance of repentance. Nor can I think my&s;elf ju&s;tified in &s;aying any longer, of every individual, "we commit <HI>his</HI> body to the ground, in <HI>&s;ure</HI> and <HI>certain</HI> hope of the re&s;urrec|tion to eternal life. We meekly be&s;eech thee, O Father, to rai&s;e us from a death of &s;in unto a life of righteou&s;ne&s;s, that when we &s;hall depart this life, we may re&s;t in him 'as <HI>our hope</HI> is this <HI>our brother doth;</HI>" &s;ince I am fully a&s;&s;ured that there will be a re&s;urrection of the wicked to eternal damna|tion, as well as of the righteous to everla&s;ting life: and, tho' I &s;hould &s;u&s;pend my judgment, as becometh us, upon the final &s;tate of the vile&s;t &s;inner, that dies without any evidence of repentance, yet it is certainly very daring pre&s;umption to tell the Almighty, that we have <HI>&s;ure</HI> and <HI>certain</HI> hope of his being gone to glory.</P>

<P>A few words to the much de&s;pi&s;ed followers of a once crucified, but now exalted Je&s;us, &s;hall now clo&s;e the &s;ubject, and, therewith, all my mini&s;trations in the church of Eng|land.</P>
<P>Ye &s;ons and daughters of the Lord Almighty, who are princes in di&s;gui&s;e, though, in the e&s;teem of carnal men, you are the filth and off scouring of all! my &s;oul is troubled for you, not knowing into who&s;e hands you may <HI>now</HI> fall; whe|ther into theirs, who will feed you with the &s;incere milk of the word, or into theirs, who will "care for none of the&s;e things." Suffer, therefore, I be&s;eech you, the word of ex|hortation, from one who can truly &s;ay with the apo&s;tle, that he is le&s;s than the lea&s;t of all &s;aints, and the chief of &s;inners; but who, thro' free, rich, and &s;overeign grace, hath obtained mercy to be faithful.</P>
<P N="1">1. Flee from &s;in, every &s;in, as from the face of a &s;erpent; for, however &s;weet it may appear in the enjoyment, neverthe|le&s;s, afterwards, it bi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eth like a &s;erpent, and &s;tingeth like an adder. O what has God wrought for you and in you ac|cording to the riches of his grace! What manner of per&s;ons, then, ought <HI>we</HI> to be in all holy conver&s;ation and godline&s;s.</P>
<P N="2">2. Be ever coming unto Je&s;us, "in whom it hath plea&s;ed
<PB N="24" REF="022146_0022_0FB6FCF8ED122988">
the Father that all fulne&s;s &s;hould dwell," that you may re|ceive, out of his fulne&s;s, grace for grace, abundance of grace, grace for every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ne of need, which is every moment. Let it by your con&s;tant &s;tudy, under the influence of the divine Spirit, to live near unto him. Re&s;t not in any duties what|&s;oever. "There is a way (of external duties) that &s;eemeth right unto a man, but (O how awful!) the end thereof are the ways of death." Content not your&s;elves with ordinan|ces, without enjoying the &s;piritual and gracious pre&s;ence of the God of ordinances. True believers have real fellow&s;hip and &s;en&s;ible communion with the Father and his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t, at which golden &s;ea&s;ons they rejoice with joy un|&s;peakable and full of glory. Be often viewing, by the eye of faith, our dear Lord groveling in Geth&s;emene and bleeding on mount Calvary, and your &s;ouls &s;hall pro&s;per.</P>
<P N="3">3. Whatever it co&s;t you, never part with the&s;e &s;acred truths, "knowing of whom you received them," and that they contain the &s;alvation of your &s;ouls. Never yield up your faith, nor part with a good con&s;cience, at any rate. "For we are made partakers of Chri&s;t, if we hold the be|ginning of our confidence, &s;tedfa&s;t unto the end." If you &s;hould be called to it, rather than part with it, take "joy|fully the &s;poiling of your goods, knowing in your&s;elves that ye have in heaven a better and enduring &s;ub&s;tance." And never repine, though you be "poor in this world," whil&s;t you are but "rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom,"&mdash;and of &s;uch a glorious kingdom too!</P>
<P N="4">4. Be much employed in prayer and reading the holy &s;crip|tures. Pray for your&s;elves, for one another, and for me al&s;o. Pray frequently and fervently; "for the effectual fer|vent prayer of a righteous man availeth much." Read the &s;acred &s;criptures with care and attention, accompanied with fervent prayer and ardent &s;upplication. Inexhau&s;tible trea|&s;ures of divine wi&s;dom are contained in them. "They are more to be de&s;ired than gold, yea, than much fine gold: &s;weeter al&s;o than honey, or the honey-comb." Here are the many "exceedingly great and precious promi&s;es, which in chri&s;t are all yea, and in him amen, unto the glory of God," and the comfort and everla&s;ting &s;alvation of his people.</P>
<P N="5">5. Keep the commandments of your dear Redeemer.&mdash;Enquire into the nature of his po&s;itive in&s;titutions bapti&s;m and the Lord's &s;upper. Follow the word of God in this matter&mdash;judge impartially&mdash;and act faithfully. Love one

None but the rege|nerated have the lea&s;t &s;park of it And, whoever is a &s;ubject of it, "is pa&s;&s;ed from death unto life."

Watch over one another with circum&s;pection, &s;ympathy, and tenderne&s;s. Forbear one another, and forgive one another, even as God for Chri&s;t's &s;ake hath forgiven you. Let each e&s;teem an|other better than him&s;elf. Seek the peace and pro&s;perity of the Lord's go&s;pel Zion; "for they &s;hall pro&s;per that love her." And con&s;ider the trials, temptations, tempers, and di&s;po&s;itions of one another, that ye may provoke one an|other unto love and good works.</P>
<P N="6">6. And, la&s;tly, be looking for and ha&s;tening unto the coming of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. For, yet a little while, and he that &s;hall come will come, and will not tarry. He &s;hall come to be glorified in his &s;aints, and admired in all them that believe. This will bear you up in every moment of adver&s;ity.

"Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life,"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. ii. 10.</NOTE>&mdash;eternal life, in the kingdom of glory!</P>
<P>And thus, with this glorious pro&s;pect in view, and with the te&s;timony of a good con&s;cience, being &s;prinkled and pur|ged by the blood of Je&s;us, I &s;hall now bid you all&mdash;Fare|well. May the Lord have mercy upon you, lead you into all the truth as it is in Je&s;us, and give us a happy meeting before his <HI>awful throne.</HI> Henceforward I am re&s;olved, thro' divine grace, to go forth unto him without the camp, bear|ing his reproach, choo&s;ing rather to &s;uffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the plea&s;ures of &s;in for a &s;ea|&s;on; e&s;teeming the reproach of Chri&s;t (or <HI>for</HI> Chri&s;t) greater riches than all the trea&s;ures and temporalities of the church of England.&mdash;FARE YE WELL!</P>
<P>Now, unto Him that loved us, and wa&s;hed us from our &s;ins in his own blood, and hath made us kings and prie&s;ts unto God and his Father; to Him be glory and domi|nion, forever and ever. AMEN.</P>

<P>THIS part of &s;acred hi&s;tory, from whence my text is taken, contains, the famous defence of the great apo&s;tle of the Gentiles, in the pre&s;ence, and with the licence of Claudius Ly&s;ius, commander in chief of the Roman band, who had re&s;cued him from the hands of a furious populace. In this noble &s;peech, replete with true eloquence, divine wi&s;dom, and fervent piety, he informs the a&s;&s;embly of his birth, education, and zealous attachment to the Jewi&s;h reli|gion, and of his cruel hatred, and virulent, per&s;ecution, in the days of his ignorance, of the Chri&s;tian, religion and the profe&s;&s;ors of it; how the glorious Redeemer appeared unto him <HI>graciou&s;ly,</HI> and converted him <HI>effectually</HI> unto him&s;elf.&mdash;In particular, he relates the ble&s;&s;ed me&s;&s;age with which Ana|nias was &s;ent unto him from the Lord, to comfort him in his great di&s;tre&s;s; which is concluded with this expo&s;tulatory reprehen&s;ion, and pathetic exhortation: "And, now, why tarrie&s;t thou? Ari&s;e, and be baptized," &amp;c.</P>
<P>What an amazing change is here! what an illu&s;trious di&s;|play of omnipotent power, of everla&s;ting love, and &s;ove|reign grace!&mdash;Behold the young Phari&s;ee, who thought him&s;elf blamele&s;s in the &s;ight of God, yet filled with pride, involved in gro&s;s ignorance, and in a &s;tate o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the vile&s;t en|mity and rebellion again&s;t the Lord and his Anointed!

<HI>breathes out</HI> threatenings and &s;laughter again&s;t the di&s;ciples of the Lord! All the blood that had been &s;hed in Jeru&s;alem, was &s;o far from &s;atisfying his lu&s;t, that it only makes him thir&s;t after blood more greedily. His heart is meditating fre&s;h &s;laughter, and his feet run &s;wiftly to &s;hed blood. His throat is an open &s;epulchre. He &s;preads deva&s;tation where|ever he comes. Commi&s;&s;ioned from the high prie&s;t, he re|&s;olves to vi&s;it Dama&s;cus. In his journey, he is &s;uffered to proceed until he comes <HI>near</HI> the city. But, oh! amazing grace! this poor &s;inner is <HI>a cho&s;en ve&s;&s;el!</HI> Electing love now di&s;plays her &s;tores! Emmanuel claims the purcha&s;e of his blood! The &s;hining maje&s;ty and powerful voice of Je&s;us &s;urrounds him, awakens him, quickens and confounds him! He is humbled for his &s;ins, obtains mercy, and is filled with the graces, comforts and gifts of the Holy Gho&s;t? He is qualified for the &s;ervice of the church, and called unto it; that he may feed her whom he &s;o lately hated; watch over, plant and build, what he &s;o lately made havock of, and with &s;uch fury de&s;troyed! From &s;uch a <HI>&s;ingular pattern,</HI> or exam|ple of mercy and grace, let us be encouraged to pray for the conver&s;ion of the vile&s;t and mo&s;t bloody per&s;ecutors of the church of God. And, &s;ince he obtained mercy, let the vile&s;t &s;inner, the mo&s;t abandoned profligate, and the proude&s;t Pha|ri&s;ee, being humbled for &s;in, be encouraged to hope in, to depend upon, and wait for the mercy of the Lord. At the &s;ame time, let no licentious profe&s;&s;or, nor abandoned back|&s;lider pre&s;ume, but remember, that what he did was in ig|norance and unbelief.</P>
<P>But to return unto my text. It naturally divides it&s;elf in|to two parts.</P>
<P N="1">1. An expo&s;tulatory reprehen&s;ion, for the delaying of bap|ti&s;m; <HI>Why tarrie&s;t thou?</HI> which is aggravated by the pre&s;ent di&s;covery of mercy: <HI>and now</HI> why tarrie&s;t thou? when thou ha&s;t been &s;o highly favoured of thy much-injured Lord, who hath laid thee under &s;uch obligations to love and obedience, by the illu&s;trious di&s;plays of &s;uperabounding grace in thy fa|vour? Delays are always dangerous in every line of life; mo&s;t of all in religion, becau&s;e of all other things it is of the greate&s;t moment; and mo&s;t inexcu&s;able in tho&s;e, who&s;e peace and comfort is connected with obedience, and who are in|debted unto the rich grace and &s;overeign mercy of God, for the whole of their &s;alvation.</P>
<P N="2">2. An exhortation is &s;ubjoined to this reprehen&s;ion, which
<PB N="31" REF="022146_0027_0FB6FD037869F888">
requires an immediate &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the in&s;titutions of the Lord: <HI>ari&s;e, and be baptized.</HI> Unto this he is encouraged from the ble&s;&s;ings of purification and forgivene&s;s, that in a certain &s;en&s;e are connected with this holy ordinance, and fre|quently enjoyed in it, and by it: <HI>and wa&s;h away thy &s;ins.</HI>&mdash;And, &s;ince the enjoyment of the gracious pre&s;ence of the Lord, in the ble&s;&s;ings of his love, is to be &s;ought for, by fer|vent prayer, in his in&s;titutions, it is further added, <HI>calling up|on the name of the Lord.</HI> Which words not only expre&s;s the duty of prayer in bapti&s;m, but al&s;o the proper Deity of the Lord Je&s;us, whom we are here directed to wor&s;hip and a|dore.</P>
<P>In attempting a further improvement of this &s;acred pa&s;&s;age, I propo&s;e to lay before you:
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. A brief account of the nature and ends of this in&s;titu|tion.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. The proper &s;ubjects of it; who without delay are ex|horted to &s;ubmit unto it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. The &s;en&s;e in which &s;in is wa&s;hed away by it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. The devotion required in it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>V. The mo&s;t popular objections, and their futility, for the delaying of it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>VI. The danger and folly of per&s;i&s;ting in &s;uch a conduct.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I. The &s;acred in&s;titution referred to in my text, to which the apo&s;tle is exhorted to &s;ubmit, is bapti&s;m. In order to obtain ju&s;t notions concerning it, we mu&s;t enquire more par|ticularly,</P>
<P>FIRST. Into the true nature of it. And, as it is an or|dinance of divine revelation, we mu&s;t confine our enquiries purely to that &s;acred volume. For, from whence can we obtain ju&s;t ideas of an in&s;titution, but from the records which enjoin it, and explain the nature of it? From hence</P>

<PB N="34" REF="022146_0030_0FB6FD14BA1F70B8">
whereby this controver&s;y can be decided, and they are all in our favour.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) The radical meaning of the word <HI>baptize,</HI> mu&s;t af|ford &s;ingular light in this matter. It is, as all know, a Greek word, which our venerable tran&s;lators, for rea&s;ons be&s;t known to them&s;elves, left untra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="5 letters">ed.

<P N="2">(2.) The admini&s;trations of this ordinance, which are par|ticularly recorded, manife&s;tly &s;how this to be the proper mode. "And they were <HI>baptized</HI> of him (<HI>dipped by him) in Jordan,</HI> confe&s;&s;ing their &s;ins."

<P N="3">(3.) The things alluded unto, and figured forth by this or|dinance, will agree with no other mode of admini&s;tration. The&s;e are, a burial and a re&s;urrection. "Therefore, we <HI>are buried</HI> with him by bapti&s;m into death; that like as Chri&s;t was rai&s;ed up from the dead, by the glory of the Father, even &s;o we al&s;o &s;hould walk in newne&s;s of life.

No &s;ooner did Peter's audience enquire about &s;alvation, than he exhorts them "to repent and be baptized." In one word, all who believe in the Son of God for &s;alvation, are indi&s;pen&s;ably obliged to &s;ubmit unto this ordinance. It is not a thing they may do, or not do, with|out incurring the Redeemer's di&s;plea&s;ure. They cannot ne|glect it, but at the expence of their own peace and comfort, and at the ri&s;que of di&s;plea&s;ing God.</P>
<P>SECONDLY. From this &s;hort, view of the nature of this ordinance, the ends of it are ea&s;ily gathered.&mdash;They are &s;u|preme and &s;ubordinate.</P>
<P N="1">1. The &s;upreme end of this ordinance, is, the glory of God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. x. 11</NOTE> It is a branch of the <HI>divine coun&s;el,</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Luke vii. 30.</NOTE> which di&s;plays the holine&s;s and &s;uperabound|ing grace of the Father, in the redemption and &s;alvation of his cho&s;en, by the death and re&s;urrection of his Son. Nor is the grace, wi&s;dom, power, and maje&s;ty of his Son le&s;s con&s;picuous herein. They &s;hine forth in his regal power, who in&s;tituted it; they are di&s;played in tho&s;e la&s;t &s;teps of his deep aba&s;ement, and fir&s;t in&s;tance of his high exaltation, which are &s;hadowed forth hereby; and they are &s;weetly en|joyed, and delightfully beheld by all the faithful herein. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of the eternal Spirit. His glory appears in his fitting us for, di&s;po&s;ing us unto, ble&s;&s;ing us in, and en|abling

<P N="2">2. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> ends of this ordinance, are,</P>
<P N="1">(1.) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> e&s;tabli&s;hment, and edification. All the&s;e may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> are, the portion of the admini&s;trator, and other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.

He is here led to &s;ee how Chri&s;t was baptized in his bloody pa&s;&s;ion, to obtain the &s;alvation of his people. He beholds him not only brought into the du&s;t of death, but rai&s;ed from it, having put away &s;in by the &s;acrifice of him&s;elf. And, while he thus has fellow&s;hip with his dear Redeemer in his &s;ufferings, the be|nign influence of his ble&s;&s;ed Spirit gives him a &s;weet di&s;covery of pardon and ju&s;tification, of peace and &s;alvation herein; and not only makes him to know the power of his re&s;urrec|tion, and experience conformity unto his death, but often affords, or &s;eals &s;uch a knowledge of intere&s;t in him, and all divine ble&s;&s;ings through him, as makes him "rejoice with joy un&s;peakable and full of glory." Pardon of &s;in, an in|crea&s;e of all grace, are ble&s;&s;ing clo&s;ely connected with this holy ordinance. What a &s;oul-comforting, what a faith-e&s;tabli&s;hing, what an edifying ordinance, then, mu&s;t this be!</P>
<P N="2">(2.) Another end hereof, is, that the &s;ubject may honour the Redeemer in a confe&s;&s;ion of his name, own his kingly power, behold the obligations he is under to obedience, claim a regular entrance into his church, enjoy the privileges con|nected with it in an honourable way, and &s;olemnly devote him&s;elf unto his &s;ervice. This is the initiating ordinance in|to the &s;ervice of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. He redeemed us by his blood, that "we might be holy, and &s;erve him without fear, in ho|line&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s before him, all our days."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke i. 74,75.</NOTE> Herein

For their own welfare, we wi&s;h them duly to con&s;ider this matter,&mdash;le&s;t it be found out another day, "that they have tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the laws, and changed the ordinances" of the Lord's hou&s;e.</P>
<P>In the mean time we conclude from the preceding in&s;tan|ces of bapti&s;m, and from Chri&s;t's commi&s;&s;ion, wherein they who are taught, or made di&s;ciples by teaching, are comman|ded to be baptized; that the <HI>only proper &s;ubjects</HI> of this ordi|nance are &s;uch per&s;ons as profe&s;s "repentance towards God, and faith towards our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t." The&s;e ought to &s;ubmit, without delay, to the &s;ame. And the Lord requires it of &s;uch.&mdash;The words of our text are expre&s;s: "Ari&s;e and be baptized, and wa&s;h away thy &s;ins." This brings me,</P>
<P>III. To &s;hew, in what &s;en&s;e &s;in is wa&s;hed away by bap|ti&s;m, or <HI>in</HI> it. For the words do not &s;uppo&s;e that &s;in is wa&s;hed away by any virtue in the ordinance; but only that purification from &s;in is enjoyed from God <HI>in</HI> and <HI>through it.</HI> But more of this afterwards. It is to be ob&s;erved,</P>
<P>FIRST. That &s;in is a pollution or defilement. This, the very idea of wa&s;hing it away &s;uppo&s;es and implies. The lu&s;ts of the fle&s;h in their various diver&s;ifications, idolatry, and profanation of the &s;abbaths and ordinances of God, are more e&s;pecially repre&s;ented under the idea of pollution and defile|ment, in the &s;acred &s;criptures; tho' it is applied unto all &s;in whatever. It is all a defilement, and of a defiling nature. There is no touching the accur&s;ed unhallowed thing, but it will &s;tain and pollute us. Concerning &s;in, under this idea, we may ob&s;erve:</P>
<P N="1">1. That it is a pollution of a moral nature. All natural defilements are the dire effects of moral pollution. Sin is the very rever&s;e of righteou&s;ne&s;s and morality. And &s;inful pollution is the moral depravity of the heart, the under&s;tan|ding will, affections, and all the powers of the mind. It
<PB N="40" REF="022146_0036_0FB6FD2C0709C200">
is this which makes &s;in, all &s;in, an abomination in the &s;ight of God. He is "of purer eyes than to behold evil, and can|not look on iniquity," but with great abhorrence and dete&s;|tation.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hab. i. 13.</NOTE></P>
<P N="2">2. Sin is a general, epidemical pollution. Neither age, nor &s;ex, are exempted from it. "All have &s;inned, and come &s;hort of the glory of God."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. iii. 21.</NOTE> Some are more polluted with the gro&s;s defilements of &s;in than others, yet all are polluted with it; are e&s;tranged from God by it; and pollute all they engage in with it. The dire ferment hath leavened our whole nature. The animal de&s;ires are deeply tinctured with it. Not only are their &s;treams polluted, but in &s;ome their very current is <HI>changed,</HI> and they, &s;hocking to mention, becau&s;e &s;o &s;inful, run even <HI>again&s;t nature!</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. i. 26, 27.</NOTE>&mdash;In others they are &s;wel|led to &s;uch a height as to break down all the fences, which nature, rea&s;on, and all human and divine laws have erected, to direct and keep them in proper bounds. Every power and pa&s;&s;ion of the &s;oul is defiled by &s;in The under&s;tanding is become the &s;eat of darkne&s;s, error, and deception. The will is in a &s;tate of open rebellion again&s;t the laws, govern|ment, and grace of the Mo&s;t High. The affections are a fountain of impurity, enmity, and irregular de&s;ires. The con&s;cience is even polluted and defiled, and often becomes &s;o &s;eared as to be pa&s;t all feeling. What an epidemical de|filement then mu&s;t &s;in be!</P>
<P N="3">3. This dreadful di&s;order is truly loath&s;ome and di&s;agree|able. Tho&s;e who labour under its power, and are &s;ubject unto its prevalence, are in love with it. They take plea&s;ure in "fulfilling the de&s;ires of the fle&s;h and of the carnal mind, &s;porting them&s;elves with their own deceivings"<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Eph. ii. 4. 2 Pet. ii. 13.</NOTE> Nay, &s;ome there are, "who knowing the judgment of God, that they who commit &s;uch things are worthy of death, not only do the &s;ame, but have plea&s;ure in them that do them."<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Rom. i. ult.</NOTE> But in the &s;ight of God, it is loath&s;ome and abominable. He invariably hates it, and will never be reconciled unto the vile turpitude of it: in all its va&s;t extent, he is perfectly acquain|ted with, and therefore he loaths and dete&s;ts it, and will by no means let it go unpuni&s;hed. And of every true penitent it may be truly &s;aid, that iniquity is loathed by him. "My wounds &s;tink and are corrupt," &s;ays David, "becau&s;e of my

Nay, whatever we may e&s;teem in religion, will be of no account, if we have any fellow&s;hip with the throne of iniquity, which frameth mi&s;chief by a law.</P>
<P N="4">4. This is a di&s;ea&s;e equally &s;hameful and di&s;honourable. Of all our native original rectitude and true honour, &s;in has bereaved us. Nor can there ever be true honour enjoyed in connection with it. How many have had an honourable character deeply &s;tained by it? Neither prince nor pea&s;ant, prie&s;t nor people can have honour by it. "Righteou&s;ne&s;s exalteth a nation, but &s;in is a reproach to <HI>any people."</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Prov. xiv. 34.</NOTE>&mdash;And tho there are &s;ome &s;inner hardy enough to glory in their &s;hame, yet all who have believed thro' grace are greatly a|&s;hamed of it. "What fruit then had you in the&s;e things whereof you are now a&s;hamed."<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. vi. 21.</NOTE> God e&s;tabli&s;hed his cove|nant with, and grants all the ble&s;&s;ings of it unto his cho&s;en for this end: "That thou maye&s;t remember and be con|founded," &s;ays he to Jeru&s;alem, "and never open thy mouth any more becau&s;e of thy &s;hame, when I am pacified toward thee, after all that thou ha&s;t done, &s;aith the LORD GOD."<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Exek. xvi. <HI>ult.</HI></NOTE> And as for tho&s;e enemies of the Lord, who live without fear, and die without &s;hame or remor&s;e for &s;in, he "will clothe them with &s;hame," and everla&s;ting confu&s;ion.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">P&s; cxxxii. <HI>ult.</HI></NOTE> Sin is the &s;ource of &s;hame, and where <HI>that</HI> is not, you need fear no &s;hame.</P>
<P N="5">5. It is a pollution of a dangerous and deadly nature. It is dangerous to a man's be&s;t intere&s;ts. It expo&s;es him to the wrath of God Almighty. And therefore, of every &s;inner, who willingly per&s;i&s;ts in, and labours under this dreadful de|filement, it may be truly &s;aid, "De&s;truction and mi&s;ery are in his ways.<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">Rom. iii.</NOTE> For lu&s;t, when it is conceived, bringeth forth &s;in, and &s;in, when it is fini&s;hed, bringeth forth death."<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">James i. 15.</NOTE> In vain have &s;ome di&s;tingui&s;hed between <HI>venial</HI> and <HI>mortal</HI> &s;in.

"The wages of &s;in is death"<NOTE N="&Dagger; &Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. vi. <HI>ult.</HI></NOTE> Neither is there any forgivene&s;s of it, but through the blood of Chri&s;t. And therefore,</P>
<P N="6">6. It is a pollution, which none but God can clean&s;e from, and a defilement which nothing but the blood of Chri&s;t
<PB N="42" REF="022146_0038_0FB6FD355C897350">
can purge away. Every other expedient applied unto it hath failed. "For tho' thou wa&s;h thee with nitre and take thee much &s;oap, yet thine iniquity is marked before me, &s;aith the Lord God." Jer. ii 22. But many are they who have en|joyed healing and &s;alvation from it, in the atonement and righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Lord Je&s;us. "Neither is there &s;alvation in any other: for there is no other name under Heaven gi|ven among men whereby we may be &s;aved" from the dead|ly &s;tains of this direful pollution, Acts iv. 12. The faithful in all ages have experienced, and have been enabled to &s;ay, "If we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fel|low&s;hip one with another, and the blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t his Son clean&s;eth us from all &s;in. Unto him that loved us and wa&s;hed us from our &s;ins in his own blood."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 John. 1. 7. Rev. i. 5.</NOTE> But,</P>
<P>SECONDLY. The apo&s;tle is commanded to "ari&s;e and be baptized, and wa&s;h away his &s;ins." And as it is the blood of Chri&s;t, which alone has procured pardon, and clean&s;eth the guilty con&s;cience, and the influence of the Holy Gho&s;t, which applies this to the believer, leadeth him to it, and clean&s;eth him by it; &s;o bapti&s;m cannot be &s;aid to clean&s;e us from &s;in, either <HI>meritoriou&s;ly</HI> or <HI>influentially.</HI> Therefore, &s;ome other &s;en&s;e or &s;en&s;es, mu&s;t be &s;ought for; and which I appre|hend are the following:</P>
<P N="1">1. In bapti&s;m there is a figurative wa&s;hing away of &s;in.&mdash;The apo&s;tle Peter &s;ays that <HI>bapti&s;m &s;aveth us,</HI> as it is the <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>antitype</HI> or <HI>corre&s;ponding figure</HI> of the &s;alvation of Noah and his family in the ark, by the waters of the flood. The ark, and not the waters, being a type of Chri&s;t, was the principal mean in the &s;alvation of Noah and his family. And &s;o, in like manner, not the waters of bapti&s;m, but Chri&s;t, the ark of the covenant, the author of bapti&s;m, is the &s;alvation of believers.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. iii. 21.</NOTE> His death, burial, and re&s;urrection, are figured forth in a very lively manner in this ordinance. The waters repre&s;ent the free grace and love of God, from whence &s;alvation &s;prings, frequently compared to water in the &s;acred &s;criptures; as al&s;o, the tempe&s;tuous waves and flowing billows of divine wrath and di&s;plea&s;ure, into which our glorious Redeemer was plunged, when he obtained eter|nal redemption for us.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al lxix. 15.&mdash;xlii. 7.</NOTE></P>
<P>In going down into the water, being overwhelmed in it, and coming up out of it, we have a figurative view of Chri&s;t's
<PB N="43" REF="022146_0039_0FB6FD37F9EDAE70">
voluntary &s;ufferings and deep aba&s;ement; of his burying our &s;ins in oblivion, and &s;weetening the grave for us; of his ri&s;ing from the dead, and triumphing over all the powers of darkne&s;s; and of our communion and fellow&s;hip with him herein, and conformity unto him, in con&s;equence thereof. In re&s;pect of all which we behold in bapti&s;m a figure of our clean&s;ing from &s;in in different ways.</P>
<P N="2">2. Bapti&s;m wa&s;heth away the defilements of &s;in profe&s;|&s;ionally. Every &s;ubject of this ordinance profe&s;&s;eth faith in Chri&s;t, as his Saviour and Redeemer, who&s;e blood clean&s;eth from all &s;in, and by who&s;e obedience the church is redeemed. He profe&s;&s;eth to for&s;ake &s;in, to clean&s;e him&s;elf from all filthi|ne&s;s of the fle&s;h and &s;pirit, and to pur&s;ue perfect holine&s;s in the fear of the Lord. Hence we are &s;aid to be "buried with him by bapti&s;m unto death: that, like as Chri&s;t was rai&s;ed up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even &s;o we would walk in newne&s;s of life." Hence many of the an|cients were wont to &s;peak of being clean&s;ed from &s;ins in this ordinance: "We go down into the water," &s;ays St. Bar|nabas,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">BARNAB. Epi&s;t. Cap. 2. Edit. 1724. Am&s;tel.</NOTE> who lived in the fir&s;t century, "full of &s;ins and de|filements, and come up out of it, bringing forth fruit in our hearts, and having fear and hope in Je&s;us in our &s;pirits."&mdash;And in the vi&s;ion of St. Hermas, tho&s;e per&s;ons who heard the word of God, and were willing to be baptized, until they were informed that bapti&s;m requireth a per&s;on to part with and for&s;ake all his &s;ins, are thus &s;poken of:&mdash;"But what are the re&s;t which fell nigh to the waters, and could not be rolled into the waters? They are &s;uch as have heard the word, and were willing to be baptized in the name of the Lord, but when it comes into their minds what &s;anc|tity the profe&s;&s;ion of truth requireth, they withdraw them|&s;elves, and walk again according to their own wicked de|&s;ires."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">"Caeteri vero qui cadebant juxta aquas, et non poterant volvi in aquas, qui &s;unt? ii &s;unt, qui verbum audierunt, volentes baptizari in nomine Domini, quibus cum venit in memoriam &s;anctitas veritatis, retrah<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nt &s;e, ambulantque rur&s;us po&s;t de&s;ideria &s;ua &s;cele&s;ta."&mdash;SANCT.

<P N="3">3. Above all, baptizing may be &s;aid to wa&s;h away &s;in, in&s;trumentally, or &s;acramentally, as &s;ome per&s;ons &s;peak, it being a mean of directing our &s;ouls to look by faith unto the per&s;on, blood, and righteou&s;ne&s;s of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t,
<PB N="44" REF="022146_0040_0FB6FD398664BBE8">
for peace, pardon, and purity; and an ordinance, in which the influence of the Holy Gho&s;t, with an increa&s;e of his gifts, graces, and con&s;olations, are enjoyed: hence the apo&s;tle Pe|ter commanded his newly awakened hearers, who were cry|ing out for &s;alvation, to "repent and be baptized for the re|mi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins, and ye &s;hall receive," &s;ays he, "the gift of the Holy Gho&s;t." Many <HI>poor &s;pirited</HI> di&s;ciples have been &s;weetly comforted in this ordinance, and have had gracious di&s;coveries, of pardoning mercy, increa&s;e of grace and con&s;o|lation, with the ble&s;&s;ed &s;ealings of the Holy Gho&s;t, whereby their doubts have been removed, and their intere&s;t in all di|vine things, graciou&s;ly evidenced. And therefore, &s;uch as are &s;eeking the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings, ought not to be di&s;couraged, but confe&s;s their &s;ins, profe&s;s their <HI>little faith,</HI> and wait upon God herein. Nor can I doubt but Ananias had a &s;pecial re&s;pect to this wa&s;hing away of &s;in in my text. The apo&s;tle was but newly converted. His eyes were opened, and &s;ome rays of comfort, &s;pread through his mind. But he wanted &s;piritual &s;trength and clearer di&s;coveries of purification from &s;in. And what mean could be more proper to direct him thereto than this; wherein the Redeemer and his grace are &s;o fully repre&s;ented? "Ari&s;e and be baptized, and wa&s;h away thy &s;ins." q. d. 'The Lord hath graciou&s;ly met with thee, appeared for thee, and de&s;igns thee for his &s;ervice; and though thou labour under much weakne&s;s and many fearful apprehen&s;ions, yet as he hath opened thine eyes, and &s;ent me to inform thee of his gracious de&s;igns, follow him with|out delay in all his appointed in&s;titutions; e&s;pecially be baptized in his name, for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins, expecting his pre&s;ence and the application of pardoning mercy, while thou viewe&s;t him by faith in the &s;ufferings of his death, and the triumphs of his re&s;urrection.' This brings me to ob|&s;erve,</P>
<P>IV. That devotion is required in this ordinance, and real|ly mu&s;t take place, if we enjoy and purification from &s;in by it. The apo&s;tle is required to "call upon the name of the Lord."</P>
<P>FIRST. The object of this devotion is THE LORD. This phra&s;e, <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>the name of the Lord,</HI> is evidently expre&s;&s;ive of <HI>the per&s;on of our Lord Je&s;us,</HI> in which &s;en&s;e the
<PB N="45" REF="022146_0041_0FB6FD3B7818BF90">
term (<GAP DESC="foreign">) <HI>the name</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">So in the Old Te&s;tament, SHEM JEHOVAH, i. e. THE NAME OF JEHOVAH, i. e. I&s;. xxx. 27. and other places; and &s;ometimes only SHEM <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ev. xxiv. 11, 16. is a title of our ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer. Hence, with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, when it is &s;aid, <HI>as huchal likero be Shem Jehovah,</HI> Gen, iv. ult. "Then men began to call in the name of Jehovah," does it not imply, that Seth, Enos, and their po&s;terity, publicly invoked the divine Redeemer, the promi&s;ed &s;eed, and, in him, all that in wor|&s;hipped and called God? See Exod. xxiii. 21.</NOTE> is often u&s;ed, particularly in Matt. vi. 9. where it is applied to the Almighty. His divinity, in the &s;tronge&s;t terms, is hereby expre&s;&s;ed; for he certainly mu&s;t be the <HI>true God,</HI> as our Redeemer is el&s;ewhere called,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 John v. 20.</NOTE>, whom Ananias directed this young convert to wor&s;hip and adore. At the &s;ame time it is evident, that all that which is called DIVINE, is included in the glorious object: for whoever wor&s;hippeth the Lord Je&s;us aright, draws near the triune God through his mediation, wor&s;hippeth and adoreth his &s;acred Maje&s;ty in this Ble&s;&s;ed Mediator. "I AM <HI>in</HI> THE FATHER <HI>and</HI> THE FATHER <HI>in</HI> ME." "I <HI>and</HI> THE FA|THER <HI>are</HI> ONE<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">John xiv. 2&mdash;x. 30.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>SECONDLY. The &s;ubject of this devotion is the &s;ubject of the ordinance. The admini&s;trator of it, and tho&s;e who are &s;pectators thereof, are to unite in pious addre&s;&s;es unto God; but the immediate &s;ubject is here required, in a &s;pecial man|ner, to call upon the name of the Lord. How&s;oever exact, as to the external form of an in&s;titution we may be, yet without true devotion in it, neither the glory of God, nor our own comfort and con&s;olation can be promoted by it. If we expect our &s;ouls to enjoy purification from &s;in, in bap|ti&s;m, we mu&s;t, after the glorious example of the Lord Je|&s;us,<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Luke iii. 21.</NOTE> and in obedience to my text, be engaged, fervently engaged, in &s;piritual devotion.</P>
<P>THIRDLY. The &s;ubject matter of this devotion, or the devotion it&s;elf, is prayer, "calling upon the name of the Lord." Prayer is not only an ordinance it&s;elf, but an at|tendant upon all others, and is that which in a &s;pecial man|ner denotes them to be religious and divine. This duty be|ing required, includes the whole of inward devotion, faith, hope, love, and all tho&s;e holy affections, which ought ever to accompany this, and all divine ordinances. And it &s;up|po&s;es the proper &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m to be believers in Chri&s;t.
<PB N="46" REF="022146_0042_0FB6FD4036293430">
For, "How &s;hall they call on him <HI>in whom</HI> they have not believed<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. x. 14.</NOTE>"? as without faith, no acceptable prayer can be made to God, &s;o the per&s;on who lives without prayer, hath no rea&s;on to conclude him&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of true faith. But Saul was now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;pirit of prayer. The Lord &s;aid to Ananias when he &s;ent him to Saul, "Behold he pray|eth:<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts ix. 11.</NOTE>" which expre&s;&s;es the merciful regard, which the Lord had to his cries, and the &s;pirituality and fervency of his prayers, in contradi&s;tinction to his former Phari&s;aical le|gal &s;ervices, which were no prayers in God's account; as al&s;o, the efficacious power of &s;overeign grace, in enabling, teaching, and con&s;training &s;uch a per&s;on to pray. Grace is not more illu&s;triou&s;ly di&s;played, in bringing an abandoned profligate to pray, than in bringing <HI>a formal devotioni&s;t</HI> to the throne of grace. Upon the whole, it evidently appears, that devotion in the &s;ubject of this ordinance is required by the Lord, which is another, tho' collateral proof, that not in|fants, but profe&s;&s;ing believers, are the only proper &s;ubjects of it. I come now,</P>
<P>V. To &s;hew the weakne&s;s and in&s;ufficiency of the mo&s;t popular objections that are made, again&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to this in&s;titution. Under this head, however, I mu&s;t recede from the method preceding; and in&s;tead of taking our account from the Bible, attend unto the mo&s;t common arguments, under which I have heard pious per&s;ons &s;heltering them&s;elves from conviction of their duty.</P>
<P>FIRST. I have known &s;ome, who have acknowledged bapti&s;m to be a divine ordinance, binding on all Chri&s;t's di&s;|ciples to the end of the world, and yet have lived in the ne|glect of it, though they profe&s;&s;ed to believe in Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and gave this, as a rea&s;on of their conduct, that they did not &s;ee it to be <HI>their duty in particular.</HI> The foundation of this objection, if I am not far deceived, ari&s;es from a very dread|ful mi&s;take in the very fundamental of true godline&s;s, name|ly, that we ought, by the &s;udden &s;ugge&s;tion, or powerful application of &s;ome pa&s;&s;age of &s;cripture, to be <HI>particularly per|&s;uaded,</HI> that it is our <HI>particular duty</HI> to be baptized, &amp;c. Whatever others may do, I freely own that it is with unea|&s;ine&s;s I expo&s;e the enthu&s;ia&s;m and delu&s;ion of the human
<PB N="47" REF="022146_0043_0FB6FD4CB4748B08">
mind; of which I take this to be a real in&s;tance. That the divine &s;pirit doth open the &s;criptures to believers, bring them to their remembrance, &s;how to them the things of Chri&s;t thereby, and produce &s;alutary effects in their &s;ouls through the&s;e means, is an undoubted &s;oul-refre&s;hing truth: but to &s;ay, that when we are brought to place all our hope and de|pendence upon the Redeemer for &s;alvation,&mdash;we ought &s;till to wait for &s;uch impul&s;es as the above, to point out our du|ty in this ordinance, is certainly to &s;peak deceitfully in the matters of the Lord. Can you expect your duty more clearly &s;tated than in the &s;acred page? What other authority would you have than the&s;e words of the Lord, "Repent and be baptized; he that believeth and is baptized, &s;hall be &s;aved"? What other, what better encouragement would you have than this, "If thou believe&s;t with all thy heart, thou maye&s;t?" If you are of tho&s;e who <HI>tremble at the word of God,</HI> you will duly re|gard the &s;acred text and obey it, without expecting to be <HI>thunder&s;truck from heaven</HI> upon the occa&s;ion. As the devil is capable of bringing pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture to the mind, as well as the Holy Spirit, ought we not to fear, le&s;t we &s;light the authority of King Je&s;us in the &s;acred records, and follow the delu&s;ions of that lying &s;pirit, who ever lieth in wait to de|ceive? and in&s;tead of obeying the Prince of Life, be honour|ing <HI>his greate&s;t foe?</HI> As you tender your &s;oul's welfare and the honour of our Lord Je&s;us, let me be&s;eech you to beware of &s;uch delu&s;ions as the&s;e.

<P>SECONDLY. Others there are who neglect this holy ordi|nance, and church communion, on account of their doubts and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ears concerning their &s;tate and condition before God. The&s;e are the doubtful, who are afraid le&s;t they pre&s;ume. They are ready to think it would be daring boldne&s;s in them, under all their unworthine&s;s, &s;o attended with doubts and op|pre&s;&s;ed with fears, to confe&s;s Chri&s;t, and follow him in this and other &s;acred in&s;titutions. Had they but &s;uch comforts, and &s;o many promi&s;es as they have heard of &s;ome per&s;ons en|joying, they could take encouragement. But alas! as for them, it is quite otherwi&s;e. They are weak and feeble; have had no promi&s;e, at lea&s;t abiding ones, and conclude that their profe&s;&s;ion would only terminate in the di&s;honour of the Redeemer's cau&s;e. But how weak and futile are &s;uch objec|tions
<PB N="48" REF="022146_0044_0FB6FD5190127C98">
as the&s;e? How are we to expect a removal of our doubts and fears but by an augmentation of our &s;piritual light and &s;trength in the ways of obedience, according to his pro|mi&s;e? "They that wait upon the Lord &s;hall renew their &s;trength.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. ix. ult.</NOTE>" In this way did the apo&s;tle Paul enjoy &s;trength and comfort. In this way did Peter direct his newly-awaken|ed, &s;in-convinced, &s;oul-converted, hearers, to look for it<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts ix. and ii.</NOTE> Though I would &s;u&s;pect that faith which is never combated with doubts and fears, yet remember they are directly oppo|&s;ite unto true faith, and, if encouraged, de&s;tructive of all true peace. Therefore, oppo&s;e them continually, and give no place to them. "Fear not, only believe<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lu. viii. 50.</NOTE>" With regard unto your comfort from the promi&s;es of God, give me leave to warn you again&s;t a common, but dangerous mi&s;take. Think not, that your right to the promi&s;es, and comfort from them, depend in any wi&s;e on <HI>the manner</HI> in which they are brought into your minds. Your right to them depends upon the free grace of God&mdash;your liberty to apply them, on his free declaration, and your firm belief of them&mdash;and your comfort from them lieth in the glorious grace contained in them in conjunction with the veracity, faithfulne&s;s, and power of God to fulfil them. If you under&s;tand this &s;ubject aright, and firmly believe the &s;acred promi&s;es of the Lord, whatever doubts and fears you labour under, or are attended with, you never will have occa&s;ion to &s;ay, "I have no promi&s;e&mdash;once I had a promi&s;e, but now it is taken away&mdash;<HI>doth his pro|mi&s;e fail for evermore</HI><NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">P&s;. lxxvii.</NOTE>?" As to your fears, le&s;t a profe&s;&s;ion of the Redeemer &s;hould terminate in the di&s;honour of his name, how&s;oever plau&s;ible they may appear, they are no better founded than the other.&mdash;True it is, that many have di&s;honoured Chri&s;t by their apo&s;tacy, error, and licentiou&s;ne&s;s who have made a profe&s;&s;ion of him. But in&s;tances like the&s;e are not to di&s;courage, but to caution you. You know who hath promi&s;ed, "As the day is, &s;o &s;hall thy &s;trength be<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Deut. xxx. 25.</NOTE>." Is he not able to keep and pre&s;erve you under a religious profe&s;&s;ion, and at la&s;t pre&s;ent you faultle&s;s before the throne? And with|out he keep you, tho' you &s;hould not profe&s;s his name, into what &s;hame and di&s;honour would you be daily plunged?&mdash;Let me be&s;eech you no more to take &s;helter beneath &s;uch a covering as this, le&s;t you repent it in the end. The only
<PB N="49" REF="022146_0045_0FB6FD530342F9E8">
way to be delivered from your fears, to obtain evidence of intere&s;t in Chri&s;t, and to be pre&s;erved from di&s;honouring his name, is to ca&s;t your care, and roll all your burdens upon the Lord&mdash;to receive his word, and to follow him in this and all other Divine ordinances. "Repent and be baptized for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins. and ye &s;hall receive the gift of the Holy Gho&s;t."</P>
<P>THIRDLY. Another objection I have met with, is, that bapti&s;m, not being e&s;&s;ential to &s;alvation, may be di&s;pen&s;ed with on that account. This objection is big with ab&s;urdity. We are far from a&s;&s;erting that it is any way meritorious, or pro|curative of the ble&s;&s;ings of &s;alvation. Yet, we have &s;hown how the enjoyment of the ble&s;&s;ings of &s;alvation &s;tand clo&s;ely connected with a proper &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to it. It is <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> to a holy profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t, and a regular admi&s;&s;ion into Zion. And, I mu&s;t own, that to me it appears charging God with folly, to &s;ay, that any thing he had revealed, or any ordi|nance he has in&s;tituted, <HI>is not e&s;&s;ential.</HI> Tho' not e&s;&s;ential to the &s;alvation of &s;inners, which is obtained by the blood of his Son; yet <HI>every truth</HI> he hath thought proper to reveal, and <HI>every ordinance</HI> his wi&s;dom hath ordained, are <HI>all e&s;&s;ential</HI> to &s;ome great and glorious end, worthy of their divine Au|thor. Be&s;ides, the very &s;ame objection lieth with equal &s;trength again&s;t every other divine ordinance, and again&s;t every branch of moral conver&s;ation. It di&s;covereth no &s;mall degree of ingratitude again&s;t the Redeemer, when we can ne|glect his in&s;titutions, becau&s;e we are &s;aved by grace. And it manife&s;teth a legal, unfilial &s;pirit, to intimate that any ordi|nance is procurative of &s;alvation. And I will venture to a&s;|&s;ert, that tho&s;e &s;lothful &s;ervants, who never perform the du|ties of religion but with an eye to their being &s;aved by them, will find them&s;elves, notwith&s;tanding their mercenary, fini|&s;ter doings, expo&s;ed to everla&s;ting condemnation for their fol|ly.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. vii. 22, 23.&mdash;xxiii. 5, 14.</NOTE> Let us hear no more of &s;uch an ab&s;urd objection as this. But, on the contrary, be &s;timulated to ob&s;erve this di|vine ordinance, as well as all others, not becau&s;e we are &s;a|ved by it, but by the &s;overeign mercy and grace of God in his dear Son, have a promi&s;e of enjoying the ble&s;&s;ings of &s;al|vation in it, and are informed of its being <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> to our com|fort, reputable and orderly admi&s;&s;ion into Zion, and to the glory of God. "He that believeth and is baptized, &s;hall be &s;aved: he that believeth not, &s;hall be damned."</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="022146_0046_0FB6FD554436FAC0">
FOURTHLY. Another very formidable objection in &s;ome people's e&s;teem, is that by being baptized, they mu&s;t break their religious connections, and &s;o prevent their greater &s;er|vice and utility in the kingdom of Chri&s;t. To this I an&s;wer, that it appears at fir&s;t view, that there is a great defection in &s;uch connections as cannot be reconciled to the obedience of faith. And tho' no one more regardeth the <HI>external order</HI> of the kingdom of Chri&s;t than my&s;elf, yet I am certain that a practical &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to a divine in&s;titution, can never be &s;ub|ver&s;ive of it: tho' it may break our rank in the <HI>worldly &s;anc|tuary,</HI> it is the only way to render us <HI>orderly</HI> in the Redeem|er's <HI>&s;piritual kingdom.</HI> Tho' it may <HI>dive&s;t us of that populari|ty,</HI> which a <HI>popular connection</HI> hath inve&s;ted us with, yet it will be the way to <HI>clothe us with that applau&s;e</HI> which is truly honourable in the &s;ight of God. And, as to a &s;uppo&s;ition of its preventing our <HI>greater u&s;efulne&s;s,</HI> it be&s;peaketh a con&s;i|derable degree of pride, vanity, and &s;elf-&s;ufficiency. No doubt, but the God of wi&s;dom will make his cho&s;en &s;aints and &s;ervants u&s;eful, more or le&s;s, in every connection: but to think, or &s;ay, that in the&s;e connections in which they cannot keep his commandments, but mu&s;t often offend again&s;t their con&s;ciences, they are like to be more u&s;eful, is to e&s;tabli&s;h that dangerous, antinomian, damnable po&s;ition, &s;o greatly dete&s;ted by the apo&s;tle, that we may do evil and neglect to do good, that good may come.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. iii. 8.</NOTE>&mdash;Does not all our <HI>real u&s;efulne&s;s,</HI> in every connection, depend upon the ble&s;&s;ing of God? Are we of <HI>&s;uch con&s;ideration,</HI> that his work cannot be done without us? Are we likely to do more for him, where <HI>we</HI> choo&s;e to <HI>&s;tand,</HI> or to <HI>bow,</HI> than in the <HI>good old way,</HI> in which he biddeth us go?<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Jer. vi. 16.</NOTE> Are we more likely to have his ble&s;&s;ing in walking after the traditions of men, than in the &s;acred in&s;titutions of his word? Surely we mu&s;t be highly elevated in our own e&s;teem, if after the con&s;idera|tion of the&s;e things, we can be prevailed upon to offend our con&s;ciences and neglect the in&s;titutions of the Lord, in order to pre&s;erve popular connections, and be more u&s;eful in the kingdom of Chri&s;t. Obedience to his revealed will is infi|nitely preferable in the divine e&s;teem, to all the &s;acrifices of intere&s;t, human tradition, and popular applau&s;e that you can offer him; and to hearken with a filial ear to his coun&s;els, is more acceptable than the fat of rams, than the mo&s;t delecta|ble
<PB N="51" REF="022146_0047_0FB6FD56B60F5EE8">

<P>FIFTHLY. The fear of offending their friends and relati|ons, is a &s;tumbling block to &s;ome, and an objection to their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to this ordinance. This is &s;o weak and trifling, that one would think &s;uch are either not &s;erious in religion, or that they have never read the&s;e awful words of the Lord: "If any man come to me, and hate not father and mother, and wife and children, and brethren and &s;i&s;ters, yea and his own life al&s;o, he cannot be my di&s;ciple."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Luke xiv. 26.</NOTE> If therefore, we can prefer the plea&s;ing of any relation upon earth unto our duty towards God, we have no evidence of being Chri&s;t's di&s;ciples: may, he declares expre&s;sly, that <HI>we cannot</HI> be his di&s;ciples. Con&s;ider this matter well, ye who are ob&s;tructed in your duty by the&s;e fears. Will your relations an&s;wer for you at <HI>the judgment &s;eat of Chri&s;t?</HI> Will they be able to ex|cu&s;e you in the day of the Lord? Are they the Lords of your con&s;ciences? Have they redeemed your &s;ouls? Alas! Alas! you know the contrary full well. Therefore, comply with your duty. Their hearts, their hands, and all they have, are in the hands of the Lord, and he can turn them as he will, and into what channel is be&s;t for you too. Be not therefore di&s;mayed. If father and mother for&s;ake you, re|ject, and di&s;inherit yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, for di&s;charging a good con&s;cience, yet the Lord will take you up."<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. xxviii. 10.</NOTE> "Whether it be right in the &s;ight of God, to hearken to them more than unto God, judge ye."</P>
<P>SIXTHLY. Others are kept back and overawed from their duty in this matter, on account of the &s;hame and reproach that attend it. Few, indeed, care to expre&s;s them&s;elves ex|plicitly on this head, becau&s;e it is &s;o <HI>exceedingly weak</HI> and <HI>cow|ardly;</HI> yet from the tenor of their conduct, it evidently ap|peareth, that they are afraid of bearing the reproach. But
<PB N="52" REF="022146_0048_0FB6FD58436727A0">
what are ye afraid of? The reproaches and revilings of men? The &s;inful breath of tho&s;e vile wretches who bla&s;pheme their Maker's name from day to day? Why, do you not know that the &s;potle&s;s immaculate Saviour, was not only reproach|ed, made the drunkard's &s;ong, and &s;cornfully treated, as a madman, and a devil, by the proud, &s;elf-righteous phari&s;ees; but that he chearfully endured all the &s;ufferings of the cro&s;s, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> de&s;pi&s;ed the &s;hame, which our &s;ins expo&s;ed him unto, in order to obtain our &s;alvation? Why are you afraid of &s;uffering reproach, &s;ince that is your greate&s;t honour?&mdash;And why &s;hould you be a&s;hamed of the be&s;t of all intere&s;ts? You can &s;uffer neither &s;hame nor reproach for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, but he &s;uffereth with you. In his cau&s;e you can &s;u&s;tain no lo&s;&s;es, but he will repay them. "There is no man that hath left hou&s;e, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God's &s;ake, who &s;hall not receive mani|fold more in this pre&s;ent life, and in the world to come life everla&s;ting."&mdash;And how will ye be able to face him ano|ther day? Have ye not ju&s;t rea&s;on to fear, that he will then be a&s;hamed of you, and reject you? Trifle no longer, I be|&s;eech you, with fle&s;h and blood. "Fear ye not the reproach|es of men, neither be afraid of their revilings. Let us go forth therefore unto him, without the camp, bearing his re|proach."</P>
<P>SEVENTHLY. The only remaining objection de&s;erving any notice, that I have heard of, is, that &s;ome per&s;ons, not hav|ing any pro&s;pect of church fellow&s;hip, at lea&s;t &s;uch as is or|derly, think them&s;elves ju&s;tified in neglecting it, on this ac|count. But how trifling and weak is &s;uch an objection as this?&mdash;Are we ju&s;tified in neglecting one branch of the di|vine will, becau&s;e we have not an opportunity of regarding another? Certainly we are not: but, on the contrary, ought with all readine&s;s, to make the be&s;t u&s;e of &s;uch ordinances as we have the privilege of ob&s;erving. The eunuch, trea&s;urer of Candace, the Ethiopian queen, had no pro&s;pect of church fellow&s;hip in his own country, whither he was going; and yet he never made the lea&s;t he&s;itation upon this head. He &s;ubmitted unto bapti&s;m the very fir&s;t opportunity. For when Philip and he were in the chariot di&s;cour&s;ing upon divine &s;ub|jects, "as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water. And the eunuch &s;aid, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?" No &s;ooner had he profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf a believer in the Son of God, than "they went
<PB N="53" REF="022146_0049_0FB6FD59CF8D3F38">
both down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him." Here is a ble&s;&s;ed example, worthy of our imitation! This eunuch is &s;aid to have &s;pread the go&s;pel in &s;everal parts. And how do you know but your &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the Redeemer may be a mean of &s;preading the know|ledge of his name? Be&s;ides, this objection has le&s;s weight in it, when we remember, that there are few counties in England, in which there is not an opportunity for &s;uch to join with per&s;ons of their own per&s;ua&s;ion. All the&s;e things con&s;idered, I hope none that fear the Lord will any longer be prevailed upon to neglect their duty, and live &s;hort of their privileges. "And <HI>now,</HI> why tarrie&s;t thou? Ari&s;e, and be baptized, and wa&s;h away thy &s;ins, calling upon the name of the Lord." I come now,</P>
<P>VI. To point forth the folly and danger of neglecting this in&s;titution, that none may remain ignorant of the dan|gerous con&s;equences of their conduct.</P>
<P>FIRST. The folly of &s;uch a conduct is very con&s;picuous in every point of light, more e&s;pecially if we con&s;ider,&mdash;1. That it is our intere&s;t and real welfare which we are neglect|ing herein. To neglect the Redeemer's po&s;itive in&s;titution, is to di&s;regard his authority, and to &s;in again&s;t him. And he a&s;&s;ures us, that &s;uch per&s;ons really injure them&s;elves: "He that &s;inneth again&s;t me, <HI>wrongeth</HI> his own &s;oul." What <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ol|ly is it to wrong our own &s;ouls, to deprive them of the be|nefit, comfort, and con&s;olation admini&s;tered in the ordinan|ces of God's hou&s;e!&mdash;2. The folly of &s;uch a conduct is mo&s;t of all declared, ina&s;much as &s;uch per&s;ons reject the coun&s;el of God. "But the &s;cribes and phari&s;ees <HI>rejected the coun&s;el of God</HI> again&s;t them&s;elves, not being <HI>baptized</HI> of him." What folly to reject the coun&s;el of God, of which bapti&s;m is a part? to de&s;pi&s;e, or treat with contempt, the wi&s;dom, power, maje&s;ty, and holine&s;s of God, which &s;hine forth herein? All &s;inners act a fooli&s;h part, in their wild rebellion again&s;t the Lord and his Anointed; and certain it is, that the neglecters of the Redeemer's in&s;titutions, fall under the &s;ame predicament.&mdash;Nor is this folly of a &s;imple nature. It is big with mi&s;chiefs of a perilous kind. This brings me,</P>
<P>SECONDLY. To point forth the danger of it. I &s;carce need remind you, that all di&s;obedience whatever, the neglect of po&s;itive in&s;titutions not excepted, is &s;urrounded with dan|ger.
<PB N="54" REF="022146_0050_0FB6FD5C14DF6A10">
On what&s;oever &s;ide we turn our eyes, perils encompa&s;s it around. But, in particular&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">(1.) The danger of delaying bapti&s;m appeareth in our &s;lighting the communion of &s;aints, in order to which, this ordinance is to be previou&s;ly embraced. In the&s;e days of coldne&s;s, error, and lukewarmne&s;s, the communion of &s;aints, is but little e&s;teemed. It is, however, the greate&s;t privilege of a &s;ocial nature, that we can enjoy here on earth. "One day in thy courts, is better than a thou&s;and" el&s;e|where. Of what a dangerous con&s;equence may it be to ne|glect the&s;e things? It will be well if &s;uch per&s;ons be not debarred the fellow&s;hip of the &s;aints in glory, who neglect it in the militant &s;tate. They who are not numbered with them, <HI>now,</HI> have no ju&s;t grounds to expect they will a&s;&s;oci|ate with them <HI>hereafter.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P N="2">(2.) The danger of this delay appears, in expo&s;ing us to the painful reflections of our own con&s;ciences. No wi&s;e man would choo&s;e to feel the bitter, the painful &s;tings of an accu&s;ing con&s;cience, in his la&s;t &s;tage. And yet there are &s;ome who have felt it. A multitude of other things, carnal rea|&s;onings, and an encouraged indifference hereto, may &s;tifle conviction <HI>now;</HI> but depend upon it, your con&s;ciences will &s;peak our <HI>another day.</HI> What pain and angui&s;h mu&s;t it occa|&s;ion <HI>then,</HI> to be reminded, that <HI>when</HI> health and opportunity were pre&s;ent, the&s;e duties and privileges were fooli&s;hly ne|glected, which we &s;hall have no more opportunity to regard! Surely, if you have ever felt the augui&s;h of <HI>a wounded con&s;ci|ence,</HI> you will dread the danger of being expo&s;ed to her ac|cu&s;ations again.&mdash;</P>
<P N="3">(3.) Is it not a dangerous thing to live without practical evidence of our being related to Je&s;us Chri&s;t? Certainly it is: But if in bapti&s;m there be a putting on of Je&s;us Chri&s;t,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gal. iii. 27.</NOTE> as there really is, then it undoubtedly follows, that where bapti&s;m is not regarded, there is no profe&s;&s;ional, practical evidence or relation to him. It will be an awful thing ano|ther day not to be found in Chri&s;t; and I mu&s;t own, that we appear to have a deceitful confidence about this important &s;ubject, if we do not practically and profe&s;&s;ionally put him on.&mdash;</P>
<P N="4">(4.) It is certainly a dangerous thing to &s;in again&s;t the Sa|viour of &s;inners. If they who de&s;pi&s;ed the law of Mo&s;es,
<PB N="55" REF="022146_0051_0FB6FD5EF8E62D68">
e&s;caped not without puni&s;hment, &s;hall the neglecters of the Redeemer's holy in&s;titutions pa&s;s with impunity?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. x. 28.</NOTE> How then will you account for your conduct, or how can you think your&s;elves &s;ecure from his frowns, in the daily neglect of his ordinances?&mdash;You have no rea&s;on to expect the gracious protection of this glorious King, who are not found in the ob&s;ervation of his commandments; nor to expect his &s;acred pre&s;ence and his &s;weet con&s;olations, who neglect to appear among his &s;aints, before him, in Zion. On the contrary, you certainly have ju&s;t cau&s;e for fear, le&s;t, knowing the will of the Lord, and not performing it, ye be beaten with many &s;tripes.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Luke xii. 47.</NOTE>&mdash;</P>
<P N="5">(5.) The danger of neglecting this, and other divine ordinances, appears in this, that it is grieving the Holy Spirit. Of old, "I&s;rael rebelled again&s;t the Lord," among other things, by for&s;aking the Lord's in&s;titutions, and going in the ways of the heathen, whereby they vexed "his holy &s;pirit." But what did they get by it? Why, the Spirit, in|&s;tead of conforting, leading, and &s;upporting them, "was turned to be their enemy, and fought again&s;t them.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;. lxiii. 10.</NOTE>" It is awful enough to have the painful reflections of an accu&s;ing con&s;cience; but to have the Holy Gho&s;t to be our enemy, is awful indeed! Do we not continually &s;tand in need of his benign influence and gracious leadings? How then do we expect to bear his frown?&mdash;There are &s;everal who have laboured under the&s;e, and it is to be feared that many &s;till do. The decrea&s;e of &s;piritual gifts, the bondage of mind, and the leanne&s;s of &s;oul, under which many labour, mini&s;ters perhaps as well as people, are palpable evidences of the Spirit being grieved. It is a dangerous ca&s;e. Beware of continuing in it. Take heed, le&s;t by trifling thus in di|vine things, you provoke the Lord to give you up to a mind void of judgment. Be hone&s;t, and, without any he&s;itation, act according to the light you have. "Grieve not the Ho|ly Spirit of God, whereby ye are &s;ealed unto the day of re|demption."</P>
<P N="6">(6.) The only thing I &s;hall further notice in this affair, is, that by per&s;i&s;ting in &s;uch a conduct, we &s;hall expo&s;e our|&s;elves to the force of the&s;e words, in the day of judgment: "For who&s;oever &s;hall be a&s;hamed of me and of my words, of him the Son of Man &s;hall be a&s;hamed, when he &s;hall
<PB N="56" REF="022146_0052_0FB6FD67097EE0B0">
come in his own glory, and in his Father's, and of the holy angels<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke ix. 26.</NOTE>. But who&s;oever &s;hall deny me before men, him will I deny before my Father who is in Heaven<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Matt. x. 33.</NOTE>." From the force of the&s;e words we may now defend our&s;elves; but in the day of judgment, tho&s;e artful turns, tho&s;e flim&s;y &s;hields, will be of no avail. From the Redeemer's two-edged &s;word, brandi&s;hed with a holy indignation, they cannot pre|&s;erve us. His words will then be explained in their proper &s;en&s;e, appear in all their maje&s;ty, power, and importance, and be directed again&s;t their proper objects with that irre&s;i&s;t|able force, and demon&s;tration, which will &s;pread horror, di&s;|may, and confu&s;ion, around all that fall under their con|demnation. What a dangerous, what an awful thing then mu&s;t it be to neglect his in&s;titutions, and expo&s;e our&s;elves to the &s;word of the Spirit, which is the word of God? Surely, no per&s;on that regardeth the words of our Lord Je&s;us, will any longer per&s;i&s;t in a line of conduct &s;o fooli&s;h, &s;o dan|gerous, &s;o fatal, to their peace, comfort, and pro&s;perity,&mdash;&s;o grieving to the Spirit,&mdash;and &s;o offen&s;ive to the Redeemer!</P>
<P>Having gone through the plan propo&s;ed, though I have already tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed upon your time, yet I cannot conclude without a reflection or two in the method of improvement.</P>
<P N="1">1. Let tho&s;e of you who are wallowing in &s;in, and lying under the guilt and pollution of it, remember what an aw|ful &s;tate you are in. You are enemies to God, and expo&s;ed to his wrath and di&s;plea&s;ure. If you die in that &s;tate, you mu&s;t be as &s;urely damned, as you &s;tand or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">it there to-day. Let me be&s;eech you to for&s;ake &s;in, to repent of it, and to turn to God.&mdash;"Repent ye, therefore, and be converted, that your &s;ins may be blotted out. Except ye repent, ye &s;hall all likewi&s;e peri&s;h." O then, "labour, not for the bread that peri&s;heth, but for that which endureth to everla&s;ting life." You have the privilege of hearing the word of God, almo&s;t daily; how great will your condemnation be, if in the end you are found unbelievers! Nor will any thing &s;hort of an entire change &s;erve to &s;ecure you from eternal mi&s;ery. Sin mu&s;t not only be left in practice, but your hearts formed a|new to hate it. An inward reformation, as well as an out|ward one, mu&s;t have place, or you cannot be &s;aved. Your &s;ins mu&s;t be pardoned, your per&s;ons ju&s;tified and your &s;ouls
<PB N="57" REF="022146_0053_0FB6FD67F907F9C0">
&s;anctified, or you can never enter into kingdom of God. The&s;e are things that none but Jehovah can do. This ought to make you tremble, &s;inners, when you hear it. Salvation is not a work within the compa&s;s of human power. O then I be&s;eech you, no m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> trifle with this matter. The Lord Je&s;us, in all his fulne&s;s, grace, and glory, is preached unto you. Receive this ble&s;&s;ed me&s;&s;age. Search into the in&s;pired volume. Vile and ignorant as you are, he is able to &s;ave you. But if you continue to de&s;pi&s;e and reject him, you mu&s;t pe|ri&s;h in your folly. "How &s;hall we e&s;cape, if we neglect &s;o great &s;alvation?"</P>
<P N="2">2. Let all penitent tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, how&s;oever burdened, roll all their burdens upon the Lord, and follow him in the obe|dience of faith. Your weakne&s;&s;es, doubts and fears, are no &s;ufficient objection. Take heed that, by poring upon the&s;e, you are not lo&s;ing &s;ight of the Saviour of &s;inners. Is he not <HI>able to &s;ave</HI> you? Is he not <HI>willing to &s;ave</HI> you? He is. Why then are you di&s;couraged in following him? How do you expect comfort and peace, but in &s;o doing? The pe|nitent in my text delayed but a little, a very little, in com|pari&s;on of what you have done, and yet he met with a cutting rebuke:&mdash;"And <HI>now</HI> why tarrie&s;t thou?" With how much greater propriety, if &s;o I may &s;peak, may this be applied to many now? No longer indulge your&s;elves in neglecting his commands.&mdash;"Ari&s;e and be baptized, and wa&s;h away your &s;ins, calling upon the name of the Lord." Give your|&s;elves up to him and his people, to walk with them in all the order of his go&s;pel, "in a perpetual covenant, never to be forgotten."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah i. 5.</NOTE></P>
<P N="3">3. Let all who have been baptized, remember the ends of this in&s;titution, and &s;hew them forth. You have profe&s;&s;ed repentance towards God, and faith in our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Does it appear that your repentance is genuine, your faith unfeigned? You have been buried with Chri&s;t; but, what will this avail any of you, if you are now alive to this world, in love with it, &s;unk in the lu&s;ts and plea&s;ures of it, and walking <HI>again</HI> according to the cour&s;e of it?&mdash;Alas! alas! how often has it happened, in every age of the church, unto a race of licentious profe&s;&s;ors, "The dog is turned to his vomit again, and the &s;ow that was wa&s;hed, to her wallowing in the mire?" If any &s;uch back&s;liders hears me to-day, I in|treat
<PB N="58" REF="022146_0054_0FB6FD6A5CBA89B8">
you to remember from whence you are fallen, to repent and do your fir&s;t works. "Awake to righteou&s;ne&s;s and &s;in not." You may attempt to cover your folly, but God will not &s;uffer it long to remain hid. You may attempt the recon|ciliation of your e&s;tate with a &s;tate of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ce; but without re|pentance, it will be all in vain. Without repentance for your folly and back&s;liding you will prove hypocrites and de|ceivers in the end, who &s;hall receive the greater damnation. "Return, return, thou back&s;liding I&s;rael, faith the Lord; and I will not cau&s;e my anger to fall upon you; for I am merciful, faith the Lord, and I will not keep anger forever."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jer. ii. 12.</NOTE></P>
<P>As for you who have bravely with&s;tood, hitherto, the al|lurements of the world, &s;ee that ye continue &s;o to do. Walk clo&s;e with your dear Redeemer. Fill up your place in the hou&s;e of God with reputation and u&s;efulne&s;s. Set your affec|tions on things above. Remember what obligation your bap|ti&s;m lays you under, to walk in newne&s;s of life. O! that you a few names even in Sardis, which have not defiled their garments; and they &s;hall walk with me in white, for they are worthy."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rev. iii. 4.</NOTE></P>
<P N="4">4. A few words to you, my dear brother, the immediate &s;ubject of this ordinance, &s;hall clo&s;e my di&s;cour&s;e at this time. you have re&s;igned a place in a popular connection, merely from a con&s;cientious regard to the order and in&s;titutions of the Lord's hou&s;e. You have known that neither a liberal education nor a &s;acred office, with the pro&s;pects of prefer|ments, in a worldly &s;anctuary, are &s;ufficient to excu&s;e us in acting contrary to the will of God and our own con&s;ciences. Your conduct in this affair will be condemned by all the wor&s;hippers of mammon; nor will the &s;ober evangelical part of the clergy, in general, look upon your proceeding in any very favourable light; for this very rea&s;on, that by your doing &s;o, they are reproached. However, all tho&s;e who make the Bible the <HI>&s;ole rule</HI> of their faith, will applaud you. And, what is infinitely more, I believe the MOST HIGH will ap|prove of it. Such a &s;ingular event as this, generally excites popular admiration. But, with all due re&s;pect to you, Sir, give me leave to ob&s;erve, that it is your future conduct, which will reflect the greate&s;t honour upon this day's tran&s;ac|tions; and your pre&s;ent devotion, which will render it mo&s;t
<PB N="59" REF="022146_0055_0FB6FD75E58E74C8">
honourable to your heavenly Father, and, through his grace, comfortable to your&s;elf. The &s;olemn profe&s;&s;ion that you are now making, will engage the attention of many, and their oppo&s;ition to it, will prompt them to &s;crutinize every branch of your conduct, with more abundant exactne&s;s, than other|wi&s;e they would have done. Nor will the grand enemy of our &s;alvation be le&s;s vigilant in tempting and &s;ifting you, &s;o far as he is permitted. Peculiar watchfulne&s;s and circum|&s;pection are therefore highly needful, with a humble depen|dence upon the keeper and pre&s;erver of I&s;rael. Be firm and immoveable in adhering unto the truths of the go&s;pel. To that con&s;iderable acqui&s;ition of cla&s;&s;ical learning, which you have already obtained, be daily making &s;ome addition, more e&s;pecially in divine &s;cience, and her kindred ones; but at the &s;ame time be humble, depending upon your Redeemer, and looking unto him for divine &s;trength, all needful gifts for his &s;ervice, and grace to make a proper u&s;e of them. In this line of conduct a man will become <HI>great</HI> in the &s;ight of the Lord and his people, but <HI>low</HI> and <HI>mean</HI> in his own; he will be ho|nourable and u&s;eful;&mdash;but whatever attainments in the &s;ciences he may acquire, if he be puffed up with them, become le&s;s dependent on the Redeemer and his grace, and indifferent about the gifts and influences of the Ble&s;&s;ed Spirit, he may be a&s;&s;ured that his acquirements are a &s;nare to him, that he is entangled therein, and, without &s;peedy repentance, will be|come, in the end, contemptible, both in the eyes of God, and of all good men. To the&s;e things, I hope, dear &s;ir, you will ever have a due regard, &s;ince the glory of our God and King, your u&s;efulne&s;s and reputation, as well as the credit of the intere&s;t you now e&s;pou&s;e, are involved therein.&mdash;In order to your pre&s;ent comfort in this ble&s;&s;ed in&s;titution, you are now immediately going to &s;ubmit to, have your eyes unto the Holy One of I&s;rael. In fervent addre&s;&s;es unto the God of mercy, I now expect your concurrence. In the or|dinance it&s;elf, properly &s;o called, be meditating upon the <HI>do|ings, &s;ufferings, death, burial,</HI> and <HI>re&s;urrection,</HI> of our dear Redeemer, accompanied with <HI>calling upon his name.</HI> In go|ing down into the water, reflect upon his voluntary engage|ments, his wonderful incarnation, and his deep aba&s;ement. In pa&s;&s;ing through it, call to mind what amazing &s;ufferings he underwent; how he was <HI>baptized in blood,</HI> that we might be <HI>&s;aved from the fire:</HI> look to him as your Surety and Savi|our, your Ju&s;tifier and Sanctifier,&mdash;through who&s;e obedience

unto death the waters of divine grace i&s;&s;ue forth in rich abun|dance unto the everla&s;ting &s;alvation of all true believers&mdash;With a humble recumbency upon him, you will then emerge from the water, viewing your dear Redemer, as having bu|ried your &s;ins, overcome death, wor&s;ted the devil, &s;weetened the grave, brought life and immortality to light, and go on your way triumphing in his glorious re&s;urrection. In every branch of your conduct pur&s;ue the grand ends of this in&s;titu|tion, mentioned already, and you may be a&s;&s;ured that "the Lord of all peace him&s;elf" will "give you peace always by all means,"&mdash;in life, in death, and to all eternity.</P>
<Q><P>Now unto Him that is able to keep you from falling, and to pre&s;ent you faultle&s;s before the pre&s;ence of his glory with exceeding joy&mdash;</P>
