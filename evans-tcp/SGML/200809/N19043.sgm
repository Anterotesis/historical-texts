<HEAD>THE MODERN QUAKER.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>A comparative view of the PRIMITIVE and PRESENT &s;tate of the Society of FRIENDS, particularly addre&s;&s;ed to the Youth. Written in ENGLAND by an Ob&s;erver, and pre&s;ented to FRIENDS' Children.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<LG>
<L>THY daughters, FOX, in former days</L>
<L>When they de&s;erv'd, contemn'd all prai&s;e;</L>
<L>But with a &s;elf-approving mind,</L>
<L>No charms in human prai&s;e they find;</L>
<L>Yet let my mu&s;e their virtues trace,</L>
<L>And dwell with joy on ev'ry grace:</L>
<L>The lovely portrait hung on high,</L>
<L>Perhaps may &s;trike &s;ome fair one's eye;</L>
<L>Its charms &s;hall touch the <HI>modern</HI> dame,</L>
<L>And flu&s;h her cheek with con&s;cious &s;hame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No co&s;tly robes, no broider'd hair,</L>
<L>No &s;ilks adorn'd the mode&s;t fair:</L>
<L>Di&s;tended hoops would &s;hock the eye&mdash;</L>
<L>A naked brea&s;t would terrify!</L>
<L>They held that wanton, gay attire,</L>
<L>Was fuel for la&s;civious fire,</L>
<L>And valu'd more St. Paul's advice,</L>
<L>Which bade them &s;eek the <HI>pearl of price.</HI></L>
<L>And why &s;hould dre&s;s, our parents &s;hame,</L>
<L>Their daughters brea&s;ts with pride inflame?</L>
<L>But tho' in &s;imple robes array'd,</L>
<L>Behold what beauties grace the maid.</L>

Upon her lip &s;its &s;acred truth,</L>
<L>Temp'rance gives the bloom of youth;</L>
<L>Within her brea&s;t dwells tranquil peace,</L>
<L>With mode&s;t blu&s;hes in her face;</L>
<L>Love &s;parkles in her dove-like eyes,</L>
<L>For innocence needs no di&s;gui&s;e,</L>
<L>But prudence on her brow enthron'd</L>
<L>Commands re&s;pect from all around.</L>
<L>Fair Cha&s;tity her &s;oul in&s;pires,</L>

<L>No vain romance, or wanton play,</L>
<L>Could wa&s;te a moment of the day,</L>
<L>But oft with deep, attentive thought,</L>
<L>They read the book with wi&s;dom fraught.</L>
<L>They could employ their vacant hours,</L>
<L>Extracting health from herbs and flow'rs,</L>
<L>Which freely on the waters ca&s;t,</L>
<L>They doubt not will return at la&s;t.</L>
<L>But &s;ee them now in crouds repair,</L>

<L>That would a&s;cend from whence it came&punc;</L>
<L>Now ev'ry human care re&s;ign'd,</L>
<L>Deep &s;ilence fills th' adoring mind;</L>
<L>Patient they wait th' in&s;piring breath,</L>
<L>Which bade them ri&s;e to life from death;</L>
<L>That flame cele&s;tial, which in&s;pires</L>

<P>The following prayer was penned by a Black Man, a &s;lave, in the lower part of Virginia, and was pre|&s;ented by him to his ma&s;ter, which &s;truck him with admiration, and &s;urpri&s;e, as he acknowledged to a Friend.&mdash;Written in 1790.</P>

<L>And if we beg, we meet a &s;cold;</L>
<L>And after all the tedious round,</L>
<L>At night to &s;tretch upon the ground.</L>
<L>Has heaven decreed that negroes mu&s;t</L>

<L>Forever drag the galling chain,</L>

<P>Shall we, then, be indu&s;trious to &s;horten what is no longer than a &s;pan, or to quicken the pace of what is ever on the wing? Shall we &s;quander away what is unutterably important, while it la&s;ts; and when once departed, is altogether irrecoverable? Forbear the folly, forbear the de&s;perate extrava|gance. Shall we chide, as a loiterer, the arrow that boundeth from the &s;tring; or &s;weep away dia|monds, as the refu&s;e of our hou&s;es? How par&s;imo|nious &s;hould we be of our days; how carefully hu&s;band our precious hours! They go indi&s;&s;olubly connected with happine&s;s or mi&s;ery. Improved, they are a &s;ure pledge of everla&s;ting glory; wa&s;ted, they are a &s;ad preface to never-ending confu&s;ion and angui&s;h. On the&s;e, therefore, our eternal all de|pends. And will an affair of &s;uch un&s;peakable weight, admit of a moment's delay, or con&s;i&s;t with the lea&s;t remi&s;&s;ne&s;s?&mdash;E&s;pecially &s;ince much of our

appointed time is already elap&s;ed, and the remainder is all uncertainty.</P>
<P>But, &s;uppo&s;e we had made a covenant with the grave, and were a&s;&s;ured of reaching the age of Me|thu&s;elah, how &s;oon would even &s;uch a lea&s;e expire! Let it be extended yet farther, and made co-exi&s;tent with nature it&s;elf; yet, how &s;peedily will the con|&s;ummation of all things commence! For, yet a lit|tle while, and the commi&s;&s;ioned archangel will lift his hand to heaven, and &s;wear by the Almighty name, "That time &s;hall be no longer." The abu|&s;ed opportunities will never return, and new oppor|tunities will never more be afforded. Then, &s;hould negligent mortals wi&s;h ever &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately, for a few moments only to be thrown back from opening eternity, thou&s;ands of worlds would not be able to procure the grant.</P>
<P>What inexpre&s;&s;ible con&s;ternation mu&s;t overwhelm unthinking mortals, who have &s;quandered their time in vice, when the general conflagration commences! That dreadful day will &s;oon approach, "in which the heavens &s;hall pa&s;s away with a great noi&s;e, and the elements &s;hall melt with fervent heat; the earth al&s;o, and all the works that are therein, &s;hall be burnt up." That mighty hand, which once opened the windows from on high, and broke up the fountains of the great deep, will then unlock all the magazines of fire, and pour out a &s;econd deluge upon the earth. The vengeful flames, kin|dled by the breath of the Almighty, will &s;pread them&s;elves from the center to the circumference; nothing will with&s;tand their impetuo&s;ity, nothing

e&s;cape their rage. Magnificent palaces and &s;olemn temples will be laid in a&s;hes: Spacious cities and impregnable towers buried in one &s;moaking ma&s;s. Not only the productions of human art, but the works of almighty power, will be fuel for the de|vouring element. The mountains will melt, like the &s;nows which cover their &s;ummits; and even the va&s;t oceans &s;erve only to augment the inconceivable rapidity and fury of the blaze.</P>
<P>The&s;e are events, the greatne&s;s of which nothing finite can mea&s;ure. Such, as will cau&s;e whatever is con&s;iderable, or momentous, in the annals of all generations, to &s;ink into littlene&s;s and nothing. Events, big with the everla&s;ting fates of all the liv|ing and all the dead. We mu&s;t &s;ee the graves cleaving, the &s;ea teeming, and &s;warms un&s;u&s;pected, crowds unnumbered, yea, multitudes of thronging nations ri&s;ing from both. We mu&s;t &s;ee the world in flames; mu&s;t &s;tand at the di&s;&s;olution of all ter|re&s;trial things, and be attendants on the burial of nature. We mu&s;t &s;ee the va&s;t expan&s;e of the &s;ky wrapped up like a &s;croll, and the incarnate God i&s;&s;uing from light inacce&s;&s;ible, with ten thou&s;and times ten thou&s;and angels, to judge both men and devils.

<HEAD>ON THE WORLD.</HEAD>
<P>THIS World is like a Lottery, in which we mu&s;t expect to meet with many unlucky chances.</P>
<P>It is fancy, not the rea&s;on of things, that makes life &s;o unea&s;y to us as we find it. It is not the place, or the condition, but the mind alone, that can make any body happy or mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>When our e&s;tate in this world is perplexed and uncertain, we &s;hould be more than ordinarily con|cerned to make &s;ure of &s;omething, that we may not be mi&s;erable in both worlds.</P>
<P>A man cannot be truly happy here, without a well-grounded hope of being happy hereafter.</P>
<P>A firm tru&s;t in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of an Almighty Being, naturally produces patience, cheerfulne&s;s, and all other di&s;po&s;itions of mind, that alleviate tho&s;e calamities which we are not able to remove.</P>
<P>None &s;hould de&s;pair, becau&s;e God can help them; and none &s;hould pre&s;ume, becau&s;e God can cro&s;s them.</P>
<P>Exce&s;s of &s;orrow is as fooli&s;h as profu&s;e laugh|ter. Loud mirth, or immoderate &s;orrow; inequa|lity of behaviour, either in pro&s;perity or adver&s;ity, are alike di&s;graceful in a man that is born to die.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="024777_0063_0FC87DC666979F98">
As there is no pro&s;perous &s;tate of life, with|out its calamities; &s;o there is no adver&s;ity without its benefits. A&s;k the great and powerful, if they do not feel the pangs of envy and ambition? En|quire of the poor and needy, if they have not ta&s;ted the &s;weets of quiet and contentment? Even under the pains of body, the infidelity of friends, or the mi&s;con&s;tructions put upon our laudable ac|tions, our minds (when for &s;ome time accu&s;tomed to the&s;e pre&s;&s;ures) are &s;en&s;ible of &s;ecret flowings of comfort, the pre&s;ent reward of a pious re&s;ig|nation. The evils of life appear like rocks and precipices, rugged and barren at a di&s;tance, but at our nearer approach, we find little fruitful &s;pots, and refre&s;hing &s;prings, mixed with the har&s;hne&s;s and deformity of nature.</P>
<P>It may boldly be affirmed, that good men gene|rally reap more &s;ub&s;tantial benefit from their afflic|tions, than bad men do from their pro&s;perities; and what they lo&s;e in wealth, plea&s;ure, or honor, they gain with va&s;t advantage in wi&s;dom, goodne&s;s, and tranquility of mind.</P>
<P>Afflicton is &s;piritual phy&s;ic for the &s;oul. It is compared to a furnace; for as gold is tried and purified therein, &s;o men are proved, and either pu|rified from their dro&s;s, and fitted for good u&s;es, or entirely burnt up and undone for ever.</P>
<P>Happy are they who, laboring under any kind of affliction, can &s;ay with Job, "When he hath tried me, I &s;hall come forth as gold."</P>

cannot pray nor meditate, nor keep his heart fixed upon &s;piritual things; but let God &s;mite him in his child, health, or e&s;tate, now he can find his tongue and affections again; now he awakes, and falls to his duty in earne&s;t; now God has twice as much honor from him, as he had before. "Now, &s;aith God, this amendment plea&s;eth me; this rod was well be&s;towed; I have di&s;appointed him to his great benefit and advantage."

<P>THERE is not a greater inlet to mi&s;ery and vices of all kinds, than the not knowing how to pa&s;s our vacant hours. For what remains to be done, when the fir&s;t part of their lives, who are not brought up to any manual employment, is &s;lipt away without an acquired reli&s;h for reading, or ta&s;te for other rational &s;atisfactions?

to deceive the time, or, to &s;peak more properly, to deceive them&s;elves, the length of a day will &s;eem tedious to them, who, perhaps, have the unrea&s;on|ablene&s;s to complain of the &s;hortne&s;s of life in ge|neral. When the former part of our life has been nothing but vanity, the latter end of it can be no|thing but vexation. In &s;hort, we mu&s;t be mi&s;erable, without &s;ome employment to fix, or &s;ome amu&s;e|ment to di&s;&s;ipate our thoughts: The latter we can|not command in all places, nor reli&s;h at all times; and therefore there is an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity for the former. We may pur&s;ue this or that new plea&s;ure; we may be fond for a while of a new acqui&s;ition; but when the graces of novelty are worn off, the bri&s;kne&s;s of our fir&s;t de&s;ire is over, the tran&s;ition is very quick and &s;udden, from an eager fondne&s;s to a cool indifference. Hence there is a re&s;tle&s;s agita|tion in our minds, &s;till craving &s;omething new, &s;till un&s;atisfied with it, when po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; till melancholy increa&s;es, as we advance in years, like &s;hadows lengthening towards the clo&s;e of day.</P>
<P>Hence it is, that men of this &s;tamp are continu|ally complaining that the times are altered for the wor&s;e: Becau&s;e the &s;prightline&s;s of their youth re|pre&s;ented every thing in the mo&s;t engaging light; and when men are in high good humour with them&s;elves, they are apt to be &s;o with all around: The face of nature brightens up, and the &s;un &s;hines with a more agreeable lu&s;tre: But when old age has cut them off from the enjoyment of fal&s;e plea&s;ures, and habitual vice has given them a di&s;ta&s;te for the only true and la&s;ting delights; when a retro&s;pect of

of a benevolent heart are apt to be exceeding|ly agitated.</P>
<P>Man is born unto trouble, as the &s;parks fly up|ward; he cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down; he flouri&s;hes in health and vigour, but con|tinueth not; his days pa&s;s like a &s;hadow, and he is gone; he eateth in darkne&s;s, hath much &s;orrow, and returneth to his original du&s;t, and no further remembrance of him remains.</P>
<P>Death is the law of our nature, the debt which all mu&s;t pay, and there is no di&s;charge in that war. The works of nature wax old and decay: the lofti|e&s;t monuments of human art, pyramids, cities, &s;tates and empires, have their periods, beyond which they will not endure. All things have a tendency to change; and man, among&s;t the re&s;t of the cre|ation, when called by Providence, mu&s;t &s;ubmit to part with the life which was given him. The great and the good, the wi&s;e and the prudent, the learn|ed and the ignorant, the renowned and the ob|&s;cure, the prince and the pea&s;ant, are all travelling the road which leads to the grave.</P>
<P>The time of our departure is utterly uncertain, and the accidents which may deprive us of life are innumerable. An unexpected brui&s;e, an unde&s;ign|ed blow, a fall from a hor&s;e, the &s;cratch of a pin, the pairing of a nail, or the du&s;t of a wall, may be made the in&s;truments of immediate death: thus An|acreon, the poet, was choaked with a grape-&s;tone; Fabius, the Roman Senator, was &s;uffocated with a &s;ingle hair in a draught of milk; Pope Alexander with a fly, which &s;lew accidentally into his mouth;

<P>Di&s;ea&s;es and deaths, &s;ays an ingenious author, are &s;ecretly lurking every where; they are in our bo&s;oms, in our bowels, in every thing we ta&s;te, in every thing we enjoy. We have death dwelling with us in our hou&s;es, walking with us in the fields, lying down with us in our beds, and wrapped about us in our very clothes, always ready, at the Divine command, to give the fatal blow. If Heaven per|mits, Benhadad is &s;lain in his bed, and Ammon at his table; Bel&s;hazzar in his cups, the Egyptian fir&s;t|born in their &s;leep; Saul in the field; Cae&s;ar in the Senate; Caligula in the theatre; Antiochus in his coach; Zechariah in the temple, and Pope Victor at the &s;acrament.</P>
<P>To exclude from our thoughts that which can|not be avoided, betokens a weakne&s;s and timidity, which a wi&s;e and prudent man, who de&s;ires to act his part with propriety, would not indulge. Medi|tation on death, which terminates every &s;cene of the &s;hort period of exi&s;tence allotted to man in this tran&s;itory &s;tate, though gloomy, is intere&s;ting, and may be highly beneficial; it induces us to enquire, wherefore we were made, to a&s;certain the duties in|cumbent upon us, and to a &s;erious and attentive practice of them. No event is more &s;olemn and important, than that which is to clo&s;e the connec|tions of life. To prepare for this la&s;t hour is a mo|mentous object: to be able to meet it with a ration|al compo&s;ure and dignity, calmne&s;s and fortitude,

<HEAD>AN ADDRESS TO YOUTH.</HEAD>
<P>FINE parts, learning, or rank in life, without Virtue, are not &s;ufficient qualifications in a man whom you admit to your intimacy and friend|&s;hip. You will derive more &s;olid advantage, and profitable in&s;truction, from one hour's conver&s;e with a man of &s;obriety and virtue, than from a year's intimacy with one of more &s;hining talents, if joined with profligate principles, and a licentious conduct.</P>
<P>The greater a bad man's accompli&s;hments are, the more dangerous he is to &s;ociety, and the le&s;s fit for a companion. Vice, in a plea&s;ing garb, is mo&s;t likely to prove de&s;tructive.</P>
<P>Reject the fir&s;t intru&s;ions of <HI>pride;</HI> "it was not made for man," and very ill becomes him. <HI>Pride</HI> is a <HI>Proteus,</HI> which, the more ea&s;ily to gain admi&s;|&s;ion in the mind, a&s;&s;umes innumerable forms; but there is one certain te&s;t, whereby it may always be di&s;covered: all its &s;ecret &s;ugge&s;tions centre in the
<PB N="70" REF="024777_0073_0FC87DE44FFA7828">
exaltation of &s;elf, and a comparative depreciation of others. At fir&s;t a <HI>Pigmy,</HI> it &s;ecretly &s;olicits an entrance into the mind; when once admitted, it will enlarge to a <HI>Mon&s;ter,</HI> and u&s;urp &s;ole dominion there. What, alas! has vain man to be proud of? If he be wi&s;e, wealthy, comely, and honorable, the&s;e are not &s;elf-acquired accompli&s;hments, but the gracious gifts of his Creator, for which hum|ble thank&s;giving is due. To whatever attainments he arrives, whatever excellencies he may po&s;&s;e&s;s, they all proceed from the bounty of that Being, who can dive&s;t him of them all in a moment, and leave him an idiot.</P>

<P>If we con&s;ider life in the contracted view of the&s;e murmurers, and make it con&s;i&s;t only in &s;o ridicu|lous a rotation, life would indeed become a burthen; but if we employ the nobler powers we have, in con&s;idering what life is, and act in con&s;equence of &s;uch knowledge, we &s;hall find a &s;cene of &s;o exalted and dignified a nature, that we &s;hall be apt to think the &s;pectacle Providence has introduced us to, by ve&s;ting us with human faculties, &s;o noble, that we &s;hould &s;tand indebted only for one day's acquaint|ance with it.</P>
<P>Life, properly under&s;tood, offers to the human creature an unlimited &s;cene of plea&s;ure: but if he will confine his own &s;phere of action in a narrower compa&s;s than his powers extend, whom can he blame? If, in&s;tead of employing his rea&s;on in con|&s;idering the various parts of the univer&s;e, and ac|quiring a knowledge productive of the noble&s;t hap|pine&s;s, he will make no manner of u&s;e of tho&s;e fa|culties he is ma&s;ter of, but bury his &s;en&s;es in the gro&s;&s;er part of him&s;elf, it is no wonder if he finds the enjoyments of life trivial, few, and not worth living for. A man who makes no other u&s;e of life than what his animal frame points to, mu&s;t of cour&s;e find a void in happine&s;s; &s;ince the &s;en&s;es gratified, the little rea&s;on he has is ju&s;t enough to make him feel a want, and that want to make him

<HEAD>ON REPROOF.</HEAD>
<P>NOTHING is more common than to give re|proof to others; nothing more di&s;plea&s;ing to many than to receive it them&s;elves. In&s;tructions flatter the &s;elf-love of him who gives them, and de|note his &s;uperiority over him who is in&s;tructed: he is plea&s;ed at thinking him&s;elf wi&s;e enough to direct the conduct of another, and yet has not the power to follow his own good coun&s;els. To receive advice gives us di&s;plea&s;ure, as it &s;hews us our folly or our vices are known to the world: and however weak or vicious men may be, few but have &s;uch an opi|nion of their wi&s;dom, or are not &s;o far pa&s;t &s;hame, but it gives them &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s to be found out.</P>
<P>The cen&s;uring of faults in our friends has been attributed, and not unju&s;tly, more to pride than love or charity, as we endeavour not &s;o much to correct, as to make them believe we are without them our&s;elves. Such a reproof is only a cover to our own hypocri&s;y.</P>
<P><HI>Reproof,</HI> as Wycherly &s;omewhere ob&s;erves, <HI>is often to the weak mind what phy&s;ic is to the weak body</HI>&mdash;<HI>which either, not timed &s;ea&s;onably, or given in too great a quantity, makes the remedy wor&s;e than the di&s;ea&s;e.</HI> Nothing requires more care, experience and knowledge, than the office of a reprover. He who would correct his friend mu&s;t do it with cau|tion, and make a nice choice of a convenient time and place: he &s;hould be free al&s;o from prejudice, pa&s;&s;ion and invective, and con&s;ult the temper of him to whom he &s;peaks, that he may talk to him in that
<PB N="78" REF="024777_0081_0FC87DFB27546F88">
manner which is mo&s;t &s;uitable to it.&mdash;To do all this is not &s;o ea&s;y a ta&s;k.</P>
<P>Though there are many ab&s;urdities in giving re|proof, there are &s;ome al&s;o in receiving it. To re|prove a &s;elf-opinioni&s;t, though with ever &s;o much caution and friend&s;hip, as it calls his own conduct in que&s;tion, will be only affronting him; he cannot bear to think he has acted fooli&s;hly, or at lea&s;t that any one has perceived it. Many receive the reproof of their friends according to the dignity of the re|prover; they have a pride in being in&s;tructed by &s;ome one above them, but cannot bear advice from an equal.</P>
<P>No one is either too wi&s;e or too good to be re|proved: therefore when reproof is ju&s;t and gentle, it &s;hould be e&s;teemed as the kinde&s;t office of a friend. To give reproof is the mo&s;t difficult. He who &s;ets up for a reformer of others, ought always to watch over him&s;elf; for &s;hould he happen to fall into the frailty he condemns, he affords a public &s;cene of laughter and ridicule.</P>
