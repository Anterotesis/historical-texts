<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF THE SUFFERINGS OF <HI>RICHARD SELLER.</HI></HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The&s;e are <HI>(&s;ays the Writer)</HI> the very words that proceeded from him, who &s;at before me weep|ing, <HI>which are as follows,</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>I WAS pre&s;&s;ed in <HI>Scarborough-Piers,</HI> and refu&s;ing to go on board the Ketch, they beat me very &s;ore on the &s;and, and I refu&s;ing to go on board, they hoi&s;ed me in with a tackle, on board of the Ketch that pre&s;&s;ed for the &s;hip called the <HI>Royal-Prince,</HI> and they bunched me with their feet, that I fell into a tub, and was &s;o maimed, that they were forced to &s;waddle me up with clothes: From thence we &s;ailed into <HI>Brid|lington-Bay,</HI> where <HI>Thomas Swailes</HI> and <HI>Mary Stranger</HI> hearing of me, &s;ent me victuals on board of the Ketch; then we &s;ailed to the <HI>Buoy</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="012556_0003_0F8AD91FE06A7640">
and <HI>Nore,</HI> where they hauled me in at a gun-port, on board of the &s;hip called the <HI>Royal-Prince.</HI> The 1&s;t day of the third month they commanded me to go to work at the Cap&s;tane; I refu&s;ed, and told them, that <HI>As I was not free to do the King's work, I would not live at his charge for victuals?</HI> then the Boat&s;wain's mate beat me &s;ore, and thru&s;ting me about with the cap&s;tane till he was weary. Then the Captain &s;ent for me upon the quarter-deck, and a&s;ked me, <HI>Why I refu&s;ed to fight for the King, and why I re|fu&s;ed to eat of his victuals?</HI> I told him, <HI>I was afraid to offend God, for my warfare was Spiri|tual, therefore I dur&s;t not fight with carnal wea|pons.</HI> Then he fell upon me and beat me with his &s;mall cane, then called for his great cane, and beat me &s;ore, and felled me down to the deck three or four times, and beat me as long as his &s;trength continued. Then came one <HI>Thomas Horner,</HI> (who was brought up at <HI>Ea&s;ington</HI>) and &s;aid, <HI>I pray you,</HI> Noble Cap|tain, <HI>be merciful, for I know him to be an ho|ne&s;t man, and a good man,</HI> Then &s;aid the Captain, <HI>He is a</HI> Quaker, <HI>I will beat his brains out;</HI> then falling on me again, he beat me till he was weary; then called &s;ome to help him, <HI>for,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>I am not able to beat him enough to make him willing to do the King's &s;ervice.</HI> Then came out the Commander's Je&s;ter, and told the Captain, <HI>He would lay a guinea with him that he would make me work,
<PB N="5" REF="012556_0003_0F8AD91FE06A7640">
and hale the King's ropes,</HI> and told the Cap|tain, <HI>he was a fool;</HI> &s;o two guineas were thrown down upon the deck, then the Je&s;|ter called for two &s;eamen, and made them make two ropes fa&s;t to the wri&s;ts of my arms, and reeved the ropes through two blocks in the mizen-&s;hrouds, on the &s;tar|board-&s;ide, and hoi&s;ed me up aloft, and made the ropes fa&s;t to the gunnel of the &s;hip, and I hung &s;ome time; then the Je&s;ter cal|led the &s;hip's company to <HI>behold, and bear him witne&s;s, that he made the</HI> Quaker <HI>hale the King's ropes;</HI> &s;o veering the ropes, they lowered me half way down, then made me fa&s;t again: <HI>Now,</HI> &s;aid the Je&s;ter, <HI>Noble Cap|tain, you and the company &s;ee that the</HI> Quaker <HI>haleth the King's ropes,</HI> and with that he commanded them to <HI>let fly the ropes loo&s;e,</HI> where I fell upon the deck: <HI>Now,</HI> &s;aid the Je&s;ter, <HI>Noble Captain, the wager is won, he haled the ropes to the deck, and you can hale them no farther, nor any man el&s;e.</HI> Then the Captain called the Boat&s;wain's mate, and bid him take the <HI>Quakerly-dog</HI> away, and put him to the cap&s;tane, and make him work, and beat him and &s;pare him not. So the Boat&s;wain's mate had me down to the geer-cap&s;tane, and thru&s;t me about with the men at the cap&s;tane, and beat me withal, when he could get time; then he went and &s;at him down upon a che&s;t-lid, and I went and &s;at down upon another che&s;t-lid be&s;ide him,
<PB N="6" REF="012556_0004_0F8AD920846FF898">
then he fell on me and beat me again, then called his boy to bring his two &s;eizings, and he &s;eized my arms to the cap&s;tane's bars, and cau&s;ed the men to heave the cap&s;tane about, and in three or four times pa&s;&s;ing about, the &s;eizings were loo&s;ed, no man knew how, nor when, nor could they ever be found, al|though they &s;ought them with lighted can|dles: Then the Boat&s;wain's mate, &s;eeing what was done, cau&s;ed all the men to come from the cap&s;tane, and took a Bible, and commanded them all to &s;wear, that they nei|ther loo&s;ed me, nor knew how I came loo&s;e, (they all being willing to &s;wear) he then &s;earched their pockets for the &s;eizings, but could find none, &s;o he let them go; then he called them all again to him, and &s;aid, <HI>Hear what I &s;hall &s;ay to you; you &s;ee this is a wonder|ful thing, which is done by an invi&s;ible hand, which loo&s;ed him, for none of you could &s;ee his hands loo&s;ed, that were &s;o near him: I &s;uppo&s;e this man,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>is called a</HI> Quaker, <HI>and for con&s;cience-&s;ake refu&s;eth to act, therefore I am af|flicted, and do promi&s;e before God and man, that I will never beat, nor cau&s;e to be beaten, either</HI> Quaker, <HI>or any other man that doth re|fu&s;e for con&s;cience-&s;ake to act for the King; if I do, I wi&s;h I may lo&s;e my right hand.</HI></P>
<P>Then on the third day came the Admiral, Sir <HI>Edward Spragg,</HI> on board of his own &s;hip, called the <HI>Royal-Prince,</HI> and hearing of a man that was pre&s;&s;ed on board, that was
<PB N="7" REF="012556_0004_0F8AD920846FF898">
called a <HI>Quaker;</HI> al&s;o hearing that the Boat|&s;wain's mate had beaten me much, and had given me over, and had denied to beat me any more, he was therefore called to come before the Admiral, to an&s;wer for him&s;elf, why he would not beat the <HI>Quaker?</HI> He &s;aid, <HI>I have beat him very &s;ore, and I &s;ei&s;ed his arms to the cap&s;tane's bars, and forced them to heave him about, and beat him, and then &s;at down, and in three or four times of the cap&s;tane's going about, the &s;eizings were loo&s;ed, and he came and &s;at down by me; then I called the men from the cap&s;tane, and took them &s;worn, whether they had loo&s;ed him or no, but they all denied that they either loo&s;ed him, or knew by what means he was loo&s;ed, neither could the &s;eizings ever be found; therefore I did, and do believe that it was an invi&s;ible Power that &s;et him at liberty, and I did promi&s;e before God and the company, that I would never beat a</HI> Quaker <HI>again, nor any man el&s;e for con&s;cience &s;ake.</HI> The Admiral told him, <HI>he mu&s;t lo&s;e his cane:</HI> He willingly yielded it, and told him, <HI>he mu&s;t al&s;o lo&s;e his place:</HI> He was willing. He al&s;o told him, <HI>he mu&s;t lo&s;e his right hand:</HI> He held it out and &s;aid, <HI>Take it from me if you plea&s;e.</HI> So they took his cane from him, and di&s;placed him. So the Commander gave order to the &s;even yeomen, to beat me where ever they met me, for &s;even days and nights, and make me work: They being called to an account, what they had made me do? told
<PB N="8" REF="012556_0005_0F8AD92144AADAD0">
the Commander, that <HI>they were weary, and could not make me work,</HI> &s;o they de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed. Then the eighth yeoman was call|ed, who promi&s;ed he would beat me, and make me work; and he did beat me for a day and a night, when he met with me, and be being weary, he de&s;ired to be ex|cu&s;ed. Then the Commander &s;ent for me upon the quarter-deck before him, and cau&s;ed my clothes to be &s;tript off, &s;hirt and all, from my wai&s;t downward, then he took a view of my body to &s;ee what wounds and brui&s;es I had, but he could find none, no not &s;o much as a blue &s;pot in my &s;kin. Then the Commander was angry with them for not beating me enough: Then Captain <HI>Fow|ler</HI> an&s;wered him and &s;aid, <HI>I have beat him&s;elf as much as would have killed an ox.</HI> The je&s;ter &s;aid, <HI>he had me hung a great while by the arms up aloft in the &s;hrouds.</HI> The men &s;aid, <HI>They al&s;o had beat me very &s;ore, and they might as well beat the main-ma&s;t.</HI> Then &s;aid the Commander, <HI>I will cau&s;e irons to be laid upon him during the King's plea&s;ure and mine.</HI> Then the Boat&s;wain was called, and commanded to call the &s;hip's company together, and make ready the irons: The Commander, Sir <HI>Edward Spragg,</HI> &s;aid, <HI>You Gentlemen &s;ail|ors and &s;oldiers, who&s;oever &s;erves here under me for the King, on board his Maje&s;ty's &s;hip called the</HI> Royal-Prince, <HI>the Admiral of the blue, you are to take notice, that there is a man on board,
<PB N="9" REF="012556_0005_0F8AD92144AADAD0">
called a</HI> Quaker, <HI>he is to be laid in irons during the King's plea&s;ure and mine, for refu&s;ing to fight and eat the King's victuals, therefore I charge you all and every man, that none of you give or &s;ell him any victuals, meat, drink, or water, for if you do, you &s;hall have the &s;ame puni&s;hment that he hath.</HI> So this being called three times over, he commanded the Boat&s;wain to take me away and put me in irons. So I being kept in irons &s;ix days and nights, and falling &s;ick of a <HI>fever,</HI> I grew very weak, in&s;omuch that when I was &s;et out to ea&s;e my&s;elf, (which was but once in twenty four hours) I could neither &s;tand nor go: So the officers that let me out, called &s;ome of my country|men to carry me into the &s;hip's head to ea&s;e my&s;elf, and bring me back again to the irons. Then the officer took pity of me, and bid me lay down upon the bilboes that night, and he would hap me with a coverlid, &s;o I lay there that night, and next day till even|ing; then the officer de&s;ired me to go by the way a little, &s;eeing all was quiet, and &s;ee if I could get a little re&s;t: So I being lame of a leg with the irons, was creeping over the larboard-&s;ide of the &s;hip, the Lieutenant coming down, &s;aid, <HI>Thou damn'd rogue,</HI> (and many other wicked words) <HI>ha&s;t thou broken the irons?</HI> and with that drew his rapier, and &s;wore he would &s;tab me, and &s;o drove me back again to the irons, and called the yeo|men, and would have known <HI>who let me out,</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="012556_0006_0F8AD922704043B0">
and &s;aid <HI>he &s;hould be puni&s;hed,</HI> and I would not tell him; but the &s;ame yeoman came in the crowd, and I put my hand out to him, and he locked it, and none knew how: I then being the King's pri&s;oner, I bid them <HI>be gone, they had nothing to do with me:</HI> So I remained in irons &s;ix days more, and reco|vered very well of my weakne&s;s: Then on the &s;eventh day at night, &s;everal, all &s;eamen, fell to drinking of brandy, and playing at cards, and became very loud, the Boat|&s;wain's mate hearing of them, came down, and de&s;ired them to leave; they being full of drink, would not, &s;o a quarrel aro&s;e, and the Boat&s;wain's mate cried out <HI>Murder,</HI> and immediately there came a&s;&s;i&s;tance to him, but the men ran away and hid them&s;elves, only two were taken, and put in irons with me.</P>
<P>Now I &s;hall &s;peak a little of the Carpenter's mate's kindne&s;s to me; when I had been in irons &s;ome days, and my food being taken from me, which was three day's victuals, that I had left of that which <HI>Thomas Swales</HI> and <HI>Mary Stranger</HI> &s;ent me in <HI>Bridlington</HI> Bay, he came in the crowd, and joined him&s;elf &s;o near me, that he put about a pint of brandy into my pocket, and no man knew; like|wi&s;e &s;ome meat, and none knew; and told me he would &s;upply me daily; <HI>for,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>I have meat of my own, which is not at the King's charge;</HI> and &s;aid further, that <HI>he had a &s;trict
<PB N="11" REF="012556_0006_0F8AD922704043B0">
charge given him by his wife and his mother, be|fore he came on board, that if any</HI> Quaker <HI>came on board with him, he &s;hould be kind to him;</HI> and that he had lately received a letter from them, wherein they charged him <HI>to remem|ber his promi&s;e, and be kind to</HI> Quakers, <HI>if any were on board:</HI> But there being &s;ome occa&s;i|on more than ordinary, he was taken off on board, and I had nothing for three days and three nights, and the two men before &s;poken of, that were in irons with me, while the Com|mander was with us, the men would lie no where but upon me, and as &s;oon as he was gone, they laid off me, and gave me brandy to drink, and promi&s;ed me they would not hurt me: Then the Lieutenant came at the middle of the night, and found them lying upon me, he a&s;ked <HI>Why they did lie upon me?</HI> They &s;aid, <HI>You would have him kill'd, &s;o now we will kill him for you;</HI> then he came down the third time in the morning, and found them lying upon me, for they &s;et one to watch his coming, and he found them lying very clo&s;e upon me, &s;o that he could &s;ee nothing but my feet, I being &s;o pre&s;&s;ed and weak, that he could &s;carce hear my voice.</P>
<P>Then the Lieutenant went to Sir <HI>Edward</HI>'s cabbin door, and knocked; the boy an&s;wer|ed, <HI>Who was there?</HI> He told them, <HI>It was the Lieutenant that would &s;peak to Sir</HI> Edward, <HI>for there had been a mutiny in the &s;hip by &s;ome men playing cards, and they had beat the Boat|&s;wain's
<PB N="12" REF="012556_0007_0F8AD922EBBFCC70">
mate:</HI> He told him, <HI>he &s;hould have laid them in irons, and not called on him.</HI> He &s;aid, They are already in the bilboes. He al&s;o &s;aid, <HI>If it plea&s;e your Highne&s;s Sir</HI> Edward, <HI>to remember, that there is a poor</HI> Quaker <HI>in yet, that was laid in two weeks &s;ince, and they will lie no where but upon him, and they will kill him for us.</HI> He bid him <HI>go to the yeomen that had the keys, and take him out of the bilboes, and put up a flag at the mizen-ma&s;t's head, and call a council of war;</HI> which was done: Then the Captains of the other &s;hips all came on board to an&s;wer the council of war, before eight o'clock in the morning, (it being the fir&s;t day of the week) &s;o I being brought before the council of war, the Commander a&s;ked me, <HI>If I would go on board of an hoy that was a tender, and had &s;ix guns?</HI> I refu&s;ed, and de|&s;ired to &s;tay on board, and bear the puni&s;h|ment that I had to abide. Then he bid the council of war go on with their bu&s;ine&s;s; &s;o they did proceed, and I being &s;et on a bulk|head, being &s;o lame with the irons that I could not &s;tand, and hearing them pa&s;s &s;en|tence of condemnation upon me. The Judge was a <HI>Papi&s;t,</HI> being governor of <HI>Dover</HI> ca&s;tle, and went to &s;ea on plea&s;ure. So they could not tell at pre&s;ent what death to put me to: The Judge &s;aid, <HI>I &s;hould be put into a bar|rel or ca&s;k driven full of nails, with their points inwards, and &s;o roll'd to death.</HI> But the coun|cil of war taking it into con&s;ideration,
<PB N="13" REF="012556_0007_0F8AD922EBBFCC70">
thought it too terrible a death, and too much unchri&s;tian-like, &s;o they agreed to hang me: And I hearing them &s;peak &s;everal things again&s;t me, which I was clear of, had a de|&s;ire to ari&s;e from my knees where I was &s;et to an&s;wer for my&s;elf, but I had not any power to ari&s;e or open my mouth, but was condemned within my&s;elf, in&s;omuch that I had not power to breathe unto God; prof|fering to ri&s;e again the &s;econd time, there came a motion within me, and bid me <HI>Be &s;till, Be &s;till, Be &s;till,</HI> three times, which I o|beyed, and was comforted; then I believed God would ari&s;e: and when they had done &s;peaking, then God did ari&s;e, and I was fil|led with the power of God, and my &s;pirit lifted up above all earthly things, and won|derful &s;trength was given me to my limbs, and my heart full of the power and wi&s;dom of God, and with glad tidings my mouth was opened to declare to the people the things that God had made manife&s;t to me: With &s;weat running down, and tears trick|ling from my eyes, I told them,
<Q>The hearts of Kings were in the hand of the Lord, and &s;o are both yours and mine, and I do not value what you can do to this body, for I am at peace with God and all men, and you my adver&s;aries; for if I might have an hundred and thirty years longer, I can never die in a better condition, for the Lord hath &s;atisfied me,
<PB N="14" REF="012556_0008_0F8AD924E5580F00">
that he hath forgiven me all things in this world, and I am glad through his mercy, that he hath made me willing to &s;uffer for his name's &s;ake; and not only &s;o, but I am heartily glad, and do really rejoice, and with a &s;eal in my heart to the &s;ame.</Q>
Then there came a man and laid his hand upon my &s;houlder, and &s;aid, <HI>Where are all thy accu&s;ers?</HI> Then my eyes were opened, and I looked about me, and they were all gone; and one &s;aid, <HI>There goeth thy chief friend, the judge:</HI> Then it aro&s;e in my heart, that I had news for him from the power of God, and I &s;aid, <HI>Man, come back, I have news for thee better than ever thou heard&s;t in any Cof|fee-hou&s;e, or el&s;ewhere; and an&s;wer for what thou ha&s;t done.</HI> Then came a Lieutenant, and &s;aid, Sir Edward, <HI>this is an hypocrite</HI> Quaker. I &s;aid, <HI>Commander, I intreat thee to look upon me a little,</HI> &s;o I loo&s;ed my knee-&s;tring and put down my &s;tockings, and let him &s;ee how the blood and rotten &s;tuff ran down my leg round about; he &s;aid, <HI>put up thy &s;tocking, there is enough.</HI> Then pre&s;ently came an antient &s;oldier, and loo&s;ed down his knee-&s;trings, and put down his &s;tockings, put his cap un|der his knees, and begged his pardon three times: Then &s;aid he, <HI>Ari&s;e up &s;oldier, and &s;peak;</HI> and he intreated him and &s;aid,
<Q>No|ble Sir Edward, you know that I have &s;erved his Maje&s;ty under you many years, both in this nation and other nations by
<PB N="15" REF="012556_0008_0F8AD924E5580F00">
the &s;ea, and you were always a merciful man; therefore I do intreat you in all kindne&s;s, to be merciful to this poor man, who is condemned to die to-morrow, and only for denying your order, for fear of offending God, and for con&s;cience &s;ake; and we have but one man on board out of nine hundred and fifty, but one which doth refu&s;e for con&s;cience-&s;ake, and &s;hall we take his life away? Nay, God forbid: for he hath already declared, that if we take his life away, there &s;hall a judgment appear upon &s;ome on board within eight and forty hours, and to me it hath ap|peared, therefore I am forced to come up|on the quarter-deck before you, and my &s;pirit is one with his; and therefore I de|&s;ire you in all kindne&s;s, when you take his life away, to give me the liberty to go off on board, for I &s;hall not be willing to &s;erve his Maje&s;ty longer on board of &s;hip: So I do intreat you once more, to be mer|ciful to this poor man: So God ble&s;s you, Sir Edward, I have no more to &s;ay to you.</Q></P>
<P>Then came the chief Gunner, that had been a Captain, and loo&s;ed down his knee-&s;trings, and did beg his pardon three times, being upon his but knees before Sir Ed|ward: Then he &s;aid, <HI>Ari&s;e up Gunner and &s;peak.</HI> So he &s;aid,
<Q>If it plea&s;e your Wor|&s;hip, Sir Edward, We know you are a merciful man, and therefore I intreat you
<PB N="16" REF="012556_0009_0F8AD9250BF1D898">
in all kindne&s;s, to be merciful to this poor man, in whom there remains &s;ome|thing more than fle&s;h and blood, therefore I intreat you, let us not de&s;troy that which is alive, neither endeavour to do it: And &s;o God ble&s;s you Sir Edward, I have no more to &s;ay to you.</Q>
Then he went away. Then the Commander de&s;ired me to go down and <HI>take my leave of my friends</HI> (this day) <HI>that were on board;</HI> &s;o he gave order, that <HI>any that had a mind to give me victuals might, and that I might eat and drink with whom I plea&s;ed, and that none &s;hould mole&s;t me that day.</HI> Then came the Lieutenant, and &s;at down by me while they were at their wor&s;hip, and he would have given me brandy, but I refu&s;ed: Then the dinner came up to be &s;erved, and &s;everal gave me victuals to eat, and I did eat freely, and was kindly entertained that day; then the night being come, a man kindly proffered me his hammock to lie in that night, becau&s;e I had lain long in irons, and I accepted of his kindne&s;s, and laid me down, and &s;lept well that night. The next morning being come, it being the &s;econd day of the week, on which I was to be executed, about eight of the clock in the morning, the rope being reeved upon the mizen-yard's arm, and the boy ready to turn me off, and boats having come on board with Captains of other &s;hips that were of the council of war, who came on

purpo&s;e to &s;ee me executed; I was thereupon called to come to be executed, then I com|ing to the execution place, the Commander a&s;ked the council, <HI>How their judgment did &s;tand?</HI> So mo&s;t of them did con&s;ent, and &s;ome of them were &s;ilent. Then he de&s;ired me <HI>freely to &s;peak my mind, if I had any thing to &s;ay before I was executed:</HI> I told him, <HI>I had little at pre&s;ent to &s;peak.</HI> So there came a man and bid me go forward to be executed, &s;o I &s;tepped upon the gunnel to go towards the rope; the Commander bid me <HI>&s;top there if I had any thing to &s;ay.</HI> Then &s;pake the judge, and &s;aid, Sir Edward is a merciful man, that puts that <HI>Heretick</HI> to no wor&s;e death than hanging. Sir Edward turned him a|bout to the Judge, and &s;aid, What &s;aid&s;t thou? I &s;ay, replied he, you are a merciful man, that puts him to no wor&s;e death than hanging. But, &s;aid he, what is the other word that thou &s;aid&s;t, that <HI>Heretick:</HI> I &s;ay, &s;aid the Commander, he is more a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> than thy&s;elf; for I do believe thou would&s;t hang me, if it were in thy power. Then &s;aid the Commander unto me,
<Q>Come down again, I will not hurt an hair of thine head, for I cannot make one hair grow.</Q>
Then he cried, <HI>Silence all men,</HI> and proclaimed it three times over, that
<Q>if any man or men on board of the &s;hip would come and give evidence, that I had done any thing that I de&s;erved death for, I &s;hould have it, pro|vided
<PB N="18" REF="012556_0010_0F8AD925C6625A88">
they were credible per&s;ons.</Q>
But no body came, neither opened a mouth a|gain&s;t me then. So he cried again, <HI>Silence all men, and hear me &s;peak:</HI> Then he pro|claimed, that the "Quaker" was as free a man as any on board the &s;hip was. So the men heaved up their hats, and with a loud voice cried, God ble&s;s Sir Edward, he is a merciful man: The &s;hrouds, and tops, and decks being full of men, &s;everal of their hats flew over board, and were lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Then I had great kindne&s;s &s;hewed me by all men on board, but the great kindne&s;s of the Lord exceeded all, for the day I was condemned to die on, was the mo&s;t joyful day that ever I had in my life-time, and &s;o remained exceeding joyful, until the very time that I was proclaimed a free man. But &s;oon after troubles came upon me again, for I being laid upon the deck one night, as it was my u&s;ual lodging-place, there was &s;ome|thing appeared to me, and &s;truck me as it were dead, and I being in great dread and fear, believed our &s;hip was to engage &s;uch a day of the month, with the wind at <HI>South-Ea&s;t,</HI> then appeared al&s;o a &s;mall cloud to me about as big as an hat; after being engaged, the &s;ame cloud &s;pread and became a great one, in&s;omuch that it darkened part of the &s;hip, then I &s;tepped over on the &s;tarboard|&s;ide of the &s;hip, into the &s;hrouds, and looked aft, and I &s;aw a thick water ari&s;ing in the
<PB N="19" REF="012556_0010_0F8AD925C6625A88">
wake of the rudder, then I feared the &s;hip was near ground. This appeared to me three times that night, and I would gladly have put it from me, but I could not: Then I did believe, and was &s;atisfied of the truth of it, then I was at peace and quiet in my mind, but then I was to make it known to the pilot, and I did believe it was death by law to di&s;courage them; &s;o I thought, then I &s;hould give them an occa&s;ion that they &s;hould take away my life; but I could not re&s;t, eat, drink, or &s;leep, until I had declared it; &s;o I breathed unto God, and de&s;ired that he would find me a way to reveal it, &s;o it remaining with me two days and two nights, and being walking upon the deck, and tak|ing notice of the chief Gunner of the &s;hip, I was ordered to go to him, and walk with him; very &s;olitary were both of us, and he perceived I had &s;omething to &s;ay to him, of &s;ome weighty matter, &s;o he de&s;ired me to &s;peak my mind to him, and I told him, I had &s;uch a weighty matter to declare, that it was death by the law to declare it, I de&s;ired that he would &s;tand true to me in that re|&s;pect, and he promi&s;ed me fidelity in the pre|&s;ence of God, before whom we were, that he would be true to me in all re&s;pects, and if one &s;uffered, both &s;hould &s;uffer. Then we e&s;pied the mate of the &s;hip walking, he being a &s;ober man, we drew near to him, and he perceived we were both afflicted, and de|&s;ired
<PB N="20" REF="012556_0011_0F8AD9284EA5F060">
to know what was the matter? So we told him, We had a weighty matter, and if he would be as faithful to us, as we were one to another, we would declare it to him: &s;o he promi&s;ed to be faithful to us, for he did believe it did concern him: Then we told him the matter, and he was fully &s;atisfied of the truth of it; but, &s;aid he, it doth belong mo&s;t of all to the pilot; &s;o we mu&s;t &s;peak to him, and he being &s;uch a brickle, high-&s;pi|rited man, we &s;carce knew how to &s;peak to him, but calling him to us, and walking with him, he took notice of our heavine&s;s, and a&s;ked our bu&s;ine&s;s with him; we told him, we had a matter to declare to him of great concern, therefore we de&s;ired him to be faithful to us, and we would declare the matter to him, and he promi&s;ed to be as faith|ful to us, as he &s;uppo&s;ed we were one to a|nother; &s;o they told him the matter, then he a&s;ked, Who &s;aw it? I told him, I &s;ee it. Then he fell into a rage, and &s;eemed to fly from his promi&s;e, and &s;aid, he would go and tell the Commander, &s;o away he went, and &s;aid, he would have me executed &s;peed|ily: I &s;aid, let him go, better I die, than the whole company peri&s;h; but they &s;aid, if thou die, we will all die. Then he came to us again near weeping, and told us, that when he came before the Commander, his mouth was &s;topt, that he could not &s;peak a word good or bad: He was very tender,
<PB N="21" REF="012556_0011_0F8AD9284EA5F060">
and prai&s;ed God that he had &s;uch a me&s;&s;en|ger. Then he took me by the hand, and de&s;ired me to tell him the name of the &s;and, I told him, I did not know, I never came there, but at that time I looked up with my Eyes, and told him where-abouts the &s;and laid; &s;o he de&s;ired me to go to the Compa&s;s, and he a&s;ked me, if I knew the Compa&s;s? I told him, very well; &s;o I &s;hewed him upon what point of the compa&s;s the &s;aid &s;and laid, and he took a book out of his pocket, and found the &s;and, and the name of it. Some days after we were engaged on that very point with the Hollanders, and as &s;oon as we were engaged, the cloud appeared to me, and came and darkened the &s;hip, then I &s;tept in|to the main-&s;hrouds, and I &s;aw the thick water, then I &s;hewed the pilot it, and he called two of the be&s;t men to the lead, they cried five fathom and a quarter; then the pilot cried, Starboard your helm; then the Commander cried, Larboard your helm, and bring her too; the pilot &s;aid, he would bring the King's &s;hip no nearer, he would give over his charge: The Commander cried, Bring her too. The pilot cried to the Lead|men, Sing aloud that Sir Edward may hear, (for the outery was very great among&s;t the officers and &s;eamen, becau&s;e the &s;hip was &s;o near a ground, and the enemies upon them) &s;o they cried, a quarter le&s;s five: The Com|mander cried, we &s;hall have our Royal-Prince
<PB N="22" REF="012556_0012_0F8AD92912DD0A60">
on ground, take up your charge, pi|lot. Then he cried hard, Starboard your helm, and &s;ee how our &s;hip will veer; &s;o &s;he did bear round up: The men at the lead cried, five fathom and a better depth; then the Commander cried, God pre&s;erve the Royal-Prince: Then the pilot cried, be of good cheer, Commander: They cried &s;ix fathom, then nine fathom, then fifteen fa|thom, then &s;ixteen fathom. The Hollanders then &s;houted, and cried. Sir Edward runs. Then he cried, Bring her too again, and the fight continued till the middle of the day was over, and it fell calm: And the &s;hips being engaged on head of us, we could &s;ee nothing but fire and &s;moke; &s;o out of that &s;moke I e&s;pied a fire-&s;hip de&s;igned to lay us on board of the larboard-bow: then I cried to the chief gunner to come to me quickly, and I &s;hewed him the fire-&s;hip coming to board us on the larboard-bow: Then he fired a cha&s;e gun with a ball in her, and as &s;oon as the &s;moke was gone from the gun, we e&s;|pied the fire-&s;hip all on a fire, blown up, and what remained of her &s;allied on board of the Cambridge, and only burned her antient. The fight continued, and my employ was to carry down the wounded men, and look out for fire-&s;hips, and the Commander was mightily plea&s;ed with my &s;ervice, and &s;aid,
<Q>It would have been a great pity that my life &s;hould have been taken away be|fore
<PB N="23" REF="012556_0012_0F8AD92912DD0A60">
the engagement, and the chief Gun|ner &s;aid, I was in&s;trumental, through mercy, not only for giving notice of the &s;hip coming on ground upon the &s;and, but al&s;o for preventing of the fire-&s;hip that was near to board us, who gave me the fir&s;t notice, whereof I am witne&s;s.</Q>
And the Lieutenant &s;aid to the Commander, that there was not a more undaunted man on board except his Highne&s;s.</P>
<P>Eight days after, we were engaged again with the Hollanders, and the officers &s;ent for me upon the Quarter-deck, and a&s;ked me what I would do that day? I told them, I was willing to do as I had done before; they de&s;ired I would do that &s;ervice, and take that care upon me, only to look out for fire &s;hips coming on board: I told them, I was free to do it, likewi&s;e to carry down the wounded men if there was occa&s;ion; &s;o pre&s;ently we engaged, but not one fire-&s;hip troubled us that day, but we lo&s;t about two hundred men. The Lieutenant meeting me, he a&s;ked me, If I had received any wounds? I told him, I had received none, but was well. He a&s;ked me, How came I to be &s;o bloody? Then I told him, It was with carrying down wounded men. So he took me in his arms, and ki&s;&s;ed me, and that was the &s;ame Lieu|tenant that per&s;ecuted me &s;o with irons at the fir&s;t. Then we came to the <HI>Buoy</HI> and <HI>Nore</HI> again, and then went up near <HI>Chatham,</HI> and
<PB N="24" REF="012556_0013_0F8AD929855BD768">
the King coming on board, the Lieutenant de&s;ired me to go and walk upon the deck with him in &s;ight of the King, that haply &s;ome might give him notice of me, hoping I might be brought to a trial, and have my liberty; but I did not under&s;tand that he had any intelligence of me. The next day the &s;ame Lieutenant came to me, and de&s;ired me to walk along with him upon the quar|ter-deck: I being &s;omewhat unwilling, told him, I did not u&s;e to go upon the quarter-deck, unle&s;s I was called by the officers: He &s;aid, my uncle hath much bu&s;ine&s;s, and doth forget you, &s;o walk along with me, I de&s;ire you: And I did as he de&s;ired me, and he being with me, walked away and left me alone; the Commander being there, and &s;e|veral Captains with him, he came from his company to me, and laid his hand upon my head and &s;aid,
<Q>Thou ha&s;t done well, and very well too:</Q>
So he walked by me and I blu&s;hed; then he a&s;ked me, Why I blu&s;h|ed? I told him I de&s;ired to know wherein I had done &s;o well: He &s;aid, by encouraging them which &s;hould have encouraged both thee and me. Then &s;aid he, Thou &s;halt have thy liberty to go on &s;hore. I a&s;ked him, If I might go on &s;hore to recruit, or go to my own Being? He &s;aid, I &s;hould chu&s;e whether I would. I told him, I had rather go to my own Being: He &s;aid, I &s;hould do &s;o. Then I told him, There was one thing that I re|que&s;ted
<PB N="25" REF="012556_0013_0F8AD929855BD768">
of him yet, that he would be plea&s;ed to give me a <HI>Certificate</HI> under his hand, to cer|tify that I am not run away: He &s;aid, Thou &s;halt have one to keep thee clear at home, and al&s;o in thy fi&s;hing; for he knew I was a Fi&s;herman. So he called the Captain, and ordered him to write me a <HI>Certificate,</HI> and bring it to him; which he did with &s;peed, but he did not like it, but flung it him a|gain, and ordered him to make me one more legible; then he brought another, and he &s;igned it and gave it me, <HI>and wi&s;hed me well,</HI> and &s;aid, <HI>he de&s;ired to hear from me if I got well home,</HI> and I told him, <HI>I would &s;end him a letter,</HI> and &s;o I did: But &s;oon after I got into <HI>Lon|don,</HI> two pre&s;s-crews came to me, and &s;aid, <HI>This is Sir</HI> Edward's Quaker; <HI>you are welcome to &s;hore, will you plea&s;e to go to the Tavern with us?</HI> I told them, <HI>I would not go, nor drink any thing:</HI> Then they <HI>wi&s;hed me well home.</HI></P>
<P>Al&s;o they proffered me my pay, before I came off on board, and &s;aid, <HI>I de&s;erved it as well as any man on board;</HI> but I refu&s;ed, and told them, <HI>I had of my own, that I hoped would &s;erve me home.</HI> And the Lieutenant was troubled becau&s;e I would take nothing; he would have given me twenty &s;hillings, but I would not take it,"</P>
<P>Thus ends the <HI>remarkable Narrative</HI> of the Sufferings of this <HI>faithful &s;ailor,</HI> who rather than violate his con&s;cience by being in&s;tru|mental to de&s;troy other men's lives, endured
<PB N="26" REF="012556_0014_0F8AD92A452828F0">
with much patience many and &s;ore trials, per&s;evering faithful in his te&s;timony again&s;t <HI>War</HI> and <HI>Fighting,</HI> even to death; to which he was wholly re&s;igned, and from which he was pre&s;erved by a &s;ingular providence at|tending him, in tho&s;e moments of time which he thought would have been his la&s;t. But the virulence of the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Judge again&s;t him as an <HI>Heretick,</HI> gave the Commander, Sir <HI>Edward Spragg,</HI> who profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf a <HI>Prote&s;tant,</HI> &s;uch di&s;gu&s;t, that &s;corning to be made a tool to execute the vengeance of a <HI>Papi&s;t</HI> in this Ca&s;e, he delivered the innocent man from the death he was condemned to: Being thus pre&s;erved alive, he was made in|&s;trumental to the &s;aving of the &s;hip, and the lives of many therein: and by the exerci&s;e of an undaunted <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> courage and con|&s;tancy, triumphed over the malice of his ad|ver&s;aries, who, con&s;cience of his innocence, at length became his friends and favourers.</P>
