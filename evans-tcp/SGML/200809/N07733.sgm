<HEAD><HI>The Plain Dealer,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>_FOR &s;everal years I have been a &s;ilent &s;pectator of the political conduct of a particular faction in this province; I have ob&s;erv'd how they have ruled in mo&s;t public tran&s;actions; have handled the pub|lic money, and di&s;po&s;ed of our lives and fortunes at plea&s;ure: I have &s;een this very faction rai&s;e the hue and cry about liberty, while they were &s;tealing the poor remains of liberty from the mi|&s;erable inhabitants of the province: And I have now ob&s;erv'd, that while the injur'd and di&s;tre&s;&s;|ed are crying for redre&s;s, they are endeavouring to plunge us into new &s;chemes, in order to amu&s;e us; tho' the wound is &s;till bleeding of which we have complain'd. In &s;uch a &s;ituation, &s;ilence would no longer become a friend of liberty and his country. And as our repre&s;entatives are gone home to con&s;ult with their con&s;tituents, what is to be done in this conjuncture, I think we are now in a particular manner call'd upon to &s;peak out, and tell what we take to be the origin of all our troubles, and what is the be&s;t way to cure them. For my part, I am clearly per&s;uaded that Quaker politicks, and a Quaker faction,
<PB N="4" REF="009875_0003_0F7AD24D8783D018">
have involv'd this province into almo&s;t all the contentions, and all the mi&s;eries under which we have &s;o long &s;truggled.</P>
<P>There can never be a greater cau&s;e, perhaps no other cau&s;e of tumults and complaints in any government, than the people conceiving that un|ju&s;t laws are impo&s;ed on them, and that mea|&s;ures are pur&s;ued to which they did not con&s;ent. This is the very ca&s;e with the majority of this pro|vince. They are depriv'd of their &s;hare in le|gi&s;lation; laws are made and impos'd on them, and mea&s;ures are taken which they do not ap|prove, and yet cannot prevent, becau&s;e they are not fairly repre&s;ented in A&s;&s;embly. This would be in any view, an intolerable grievance, as it deprives us of liberty; but that grievance is doubled, when we con&s;ider that it is contrary to an expre&s;s &s;tipulation in Charter, for which we left our native country, and came to this. howl|ing wilderne&s;s.&mdash;This grievance is the founda|tion of all our trouble, and has its origin from Quakers. You, Gentlemen, &s;oon perceiv'd that the majority of your people were come over at fir&s;t, and that all future increa&s;e of this province would be of other denominations. The govern|ment was in your hands, and that you might never loo&s;e it, you re&s;olv'd to deprive all new Counties of their rights as Engli&s;hmen, and their rights by the Proprietor's charter: And you have &s;o contrived it, that three Quaker counties may give laws to all the province, altho' it &s;hould
<PB N="5" REF="009875_0004_0F7AD24E08445928">
contain fifteen counties. If you had not form'd new counties, the people now in tho&s;e counties mu&s;t have voted among&s;t you, and might have turn'd you out of power; but now you have made blanks of them for ever; and by this &s;cheme they mu&s;t ever wear &s;uch a yoke as a Quaker may plea&s;e to &s;hape for them. If the province is to be protected, the principal of Non-Re&s;i&s;tance takes place, and we mu&s;t protect your lives; but if money is to be rais'd, a very different principal takes place, and you will take care of our money. In this ble&s;&s;ed &s;ituation we have jogg'd on, and call'd our &s;elves Freemen. The poor &s;un-burned African comes to a more de&s;i|rable &s;lavery in this province than we; for his ma&s;ter is at lea&s;t careful of his life; but ours diligently pur&s;ue &s;uch practices as bring us to de|&s;truction.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the la&s;t French war, you would not grant &s;o much as &pound;. 10,000 for his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice; you had not &s;tarted your quarrel with the Proprietor then, but you plead con&s;cience, and that did as well. On account of &s;uch conduct the Engli&s;h parliament had like to've turn'd you out of the A&s;&s;embly for ever; but your Friends in London interceded, and come over to per&s;uade you to re&s;ign; and re&s;ign you did with great reluctance, ju&s;t &s;o as to make a &s;ham majority of other denominations in the Hou&s;e: But &s;ome of the gentlemen that you cho&s;e would not go heartily into your mea&s;ures,
<PB N="6" REF="009875_0005_0F7AD24ECE19C978">
&s;o you turned them out, and have put a great majority of Quakers in the A&s;&s;embly again.<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Viz. 22 out of 36.</NOTE> However tho', with much trouble his Maje&s;ty obtained &s;upplies; yet, like good engineers, you found a way to counter-plot him. It may not indeed become us who are &s;laves, to &s;ay this; but we may tell you, that his Maje&s;ty's Ge|neral,<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Lord L&mdash;n.</NOTE> his Governor,<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">Gr.

Soon as war was proclaim'd with the Indians,<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">By Gr.

them that they were cheated; and that was the proper way to make them kill the people: You attended at public treaties; procured a &s;e|cretary of &s;tate<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">C&mdash;s T&mdash;n.</NOTE> for your Indian King, and furni&s;h'd him with whatever was nece&s;&s;ary for his purpo&s;es and your's. When the Governor complain'd of this trea&s;onable tampering and treating with Indians, you mode&s;tly told him that you would do it whether he was pleas'd with it or not; for you did not chu&s;e to leave the Go|vernor and King's agent to manage the bu&s;ine&s;s without you.<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">This was done in an addre&s;s to the Governor, 1757.</NOTE> We need not tell what blood this has co&s;t our province: The mi&s;erable Dutch and Iri&s;h on the frontiers have felt your &s;courge, and the groans of many a thou&s;and widows and fatherle&s;s children which daily pierce the hea|vens, will tell it, as far as the Quaker-govern|ment in Penn&s;ylvania &s;hall be known.</P>
<P>In order yet to prove that you have abus'd the province, need I mention how the public money has been &s;quandered away? You rais'd large &s;ums, but always granted them too late, as tho' on purpo&s;e that little might be done. Was ever half a million of money &s;o con&s;umed as it has been in this province? It was not with our many troops; for a New-England colony has rais'd three times the number of troops, and yet never &s;pent &s;uch &s;ums of money. Does any man a&s;k
<PB N="8" REF="009875_0007_0F7AD25052753840">
what is become of this money? Many a thou|&s;and pounds were &s;pent in debating with the Go|vernor about things that you knew he could not grant; many thou&s;ands as bribes to G&mdash;r D&mdash;, to obtain iniquitous laws, and to pervert ju&s;tice; many a thou&s;and to &s;upport your friends, in order to maintain your faction; many a thou|&s;and to murtherers, and his Maje&s;ty's enemies; and a great many thou&s;ands where Quakers alone can tell, tho' it may not &s;uit them to tell: But hardly ever was a farthing given to &s;upport the naked and peri&s;hing frontier inhabitants; to whom the Indians that you fed, had left nothing but the mi&s;erable life. And in this pre&s;ent In|dian war, it is notorious, that great &s;ums of mo|ney were &s;pent la&s;t &s;ummer, while the mo&s;t ef|fectual endeavours were u&s;ed to order matters &s;o as to render no effectual &s;ervice to the poor and defencele&s;s inhabitants. It is no wonder, as a Prime Mini&s;ter lately informed us, that
<Q>His Maje&s;ty &s;ees through &s;uch artifices.</Q> <NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">See Lord EG&mdash;T's <HI>Letter.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>In this manner you have tyranniz'd over the good people on the frontiers of this province.&mdash; If you might avail your &s;elves of a friend&s;hip and trade with the Indians, no matter what mi|&s;eries we &s;uffer'd; if you might help the Indians to recover their lands from the Proprietor, no matter what became of the people who lived on tho&s;e lands: And &s;uffer me to ob&s;erve, this con|duct
<PB N="9" REF="009875_0008_0F7AD2518D83DE90">
of yours, and not the price of lands, was the true cau&s;e of thou&s;ands leaving this province. The Scots and Iri&s;h were rode by main force; and the unhappy Germans, being ignorant of our con&s;titution, have been blindly led into your &s;chemes, and patiently groan'd under the bur|then, while their wives, their children, and all were peri&s;hing by fire and hatchet.</P>
<P>But when you find that the province is to be en&s;lav'd no longer; the frontier counties, almo&s;t to a man, in&s;i&s;t on having ju&s;tice done them; the Hibernian winches beneath his yoke; the German, having lo&s;t every thing el&s;e, begins to pray that you would &s;pare his life:&mdash; In &s;hort, the voice of mi&s;ery and di&s;tre&s;s is no longer to be &s;tifled, now you propo&s;e to lead us another dance.</P>
<P>The Proprietor is no more; by 26 very de|cent and very mode&s;t Re&s;olves of the Hou&s;e, you conceive him as dead as Harry the Eighth. So the helm mu&s;t be clap'd hard to lee, and we &s;hall be about in a jerk. Nothing el&s;e than a King's government will now &s;uit the &s;tomach of a Quaker politician: Not that you all love his Maje&s;ty neither, for &s;ome of you would not wil|lingly give &s;ix-pence to &s;upport his cau&s;e; many who now pu&s;h for a King's government, have never paid a farthing of a tax for the King's u&s;e, but as their goods have been de&s;train'd. You would not take up arms for him, when his do|minions were at &s;take; not becau&s;e you are
<PB N="10" REF="009875_0009_0F7AD251F0DA3DA8">
mightily aver&s;e from &s;hedding blood; for we ne|ver &s;aw people have a better Go&ucirc; for that bu&s;i|ne&s;s than &s;ome of you had, when his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects were like to come in your way. But whether it proceeds from a love to his Maje&s;ty, from a hatred of the Proprietor, from &s;ome hopes of keeping the people under a Quaker-yoke for ever by this &s;cheme, or from a de&s;ire to throw down the whole fabric together, if you mu&s;t fall,&mdash;whatever is the motive,&mdash;you are de|termin'd on having a King's government.</P>
<P>But as our A&s;&s;embly adjourn'd without grant|ing any &s;upplies, in order to con&s;ult their con|&s;tituents (of whom you are at pre&s;ent no incon|&s;iderable part) whether we &s;hall petition his Maje&s;ty to take this government under his im|mediate care, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And as we find you are for|warding this petition with great vigour, we would humbly beg to know whether it might not be con&s;i&s;tent with Quaker politicks, to in|&s;truct your Repre&s;entatives to prepare the Supply Bill fir&s;t, &s;o that it may pa&s;s; and petition af|terwards, if nece&s;&s;ary. If the Bill be unju&s;t, they may prote&s;t again&s;t the oppre&s;&s;ion, and give the Proprietor as many &s;ur-names as they plea&s;e; but at the &s;ame time rai&s;e troops for the &s;ecurity of the mi&s;erable inhabitants; his Maje&s;ty will not be the lea&s;t more unwilling to take care of us, upon hearing that we have rais'd money for the &s;upport of his &s;ubjects, tho' we &s;hould do it un|der oppre&s;&s;ive circum&s;tances; I &s;hould think that
<PB N="11" REF="009875_0010_0F7AD252A4A1FDA0">
&s;uch an action would rather recommend us to his Maje&s;ty; unle&s;s perhaps he might think that while we were acting wi&s;ely, we had no occa&s;ion for new Governors. For my part, I can &s;ee but one objection to pa&s;&s;ing the Supply Bill, under tho&s;e circum&s;tances, and that is, the extraordi|nary expence to which it will put the province.&mdash; If the Proprietor's located uncultivated lands be taxed at only &pound;. 5 <HI>per</HI> hundred acres, it will re|duce his &s;hare of the pre&s;ent &s;upply about &pound;. 110 lower than it &s;hould be, according to the A&s;&s;em|bly's plan: That whole &s;um will fall upon the inhabitants of the province, which will be almo&s;t the third part of a farthing for every inhabitant, and all we &s;hould get in return for this great ex|pence, would be protecting the lives and fortunes of the frontier inhabitants: For, &s;uppo&s;e we &s;hould grant no &s;upplies during the &s;ea&s;on, we may compute that the Indians would kill about 900; make &s;laves of about 1100; and, wound, bani&s;h, and reduce to beggary about 13000:&mdash; So you &s;ee all that we get by the extra expence of &pound;. 110, is the pro&s;pect of &s;aving fifteen thou|&s;and of his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects from beggary, cap|tivity and death; which would make each one of them co&s;t us about &s;even farthings. But it may be a que&s;tion with &s;ome, whether the life of a Dutch or Iri&s;h man, be worth &s;o much?&mdash;</P>
<P>But if you will not urge the A&s;&s;embly to pa&s;s the Supply Bill, I beg that you would at lea&s;t &s;end another me&s;&s;enger to the Indians; acquaint
<PB N="12" REF="009875_0011_0F7AD253457A05F8">
them that we hope by next winter to import a new Governor, and then we &s;hall look them in the face; but in the mean time, as we are not in tune for making any defence, it will not be fair to meddle with us; but if they in&s;i&s;t on conti|nuing the murther and ravages which they began a few days ago, tell them that we have computed their chance, and on the condition that they will not wound, plunder and bani&s;h any more for the &s;ea&s;on, we &s;hall agree quietly to give up 3000 frontier inhabitants, whom they may kill, and eat if they plea&s;e; for &s;ome of your writers <NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot">See the Letter that Chief Ju&s;tice R&mdash;D &s;igned.</NOTE> have made it plain, that it's no matter what the Indians do with a man after they have kill'd him.&mdash;By this bargain with the Indians, you will &s;ave from bani&s;hment, and perhaps dying with hunger, about 13000 innocent people; which, we apprehend, would be as great a proof of your loyalty, as you have given for many years.&mdash;The thing is practicable enough; there are Indians in town, whom you may &s;end on this me&s;&s;age; and if the Governor &s;hould not ap|prove of it, you may &s;end without his approba|tion, as 'tis &s;aid you lately did.</P>
<P>We are all this time taking it for granted, that the Proprietor is to be kick'd off the Stage; but let us now &s;ee what has been his fault: He de&s;ires that his located, uncultivated lands, be tax'd at five per cent: And is there not a very expre&s;s decree to that purpo&s;e? It &s;eems unac|countable
<PB N="13" REF="009875_0012_0F7AD254F3C94F18">
to me, why the Proprietor &s;hould be blamed for what the King in Council has done; and &s;till more &s;urpri&s;ing, that we &s;hould abu&s;e him for a thing that we have already approv'd by our Agent; if the decree was unju&s;t, &s;hould not we have complained then; have repre&s;ented the great Difference of the Prices of Land, and the &s;ingular goodne&s;s of the Proprietor's Land? It is &s;trange that we &s;hould have to quarrel in this province, at the expence of &s;o much Mo|ney, and danger of &s;o many lives, about a Thing that &s;hould have been &s;ettled in England long ago. We conceive that we have &s;pent about ten thou&s;and pounds already, upon an emba&s;&s;y to London; but if that &s;um was not enough to get bu&s;ine&s;s well done, let us &s;end again, and &s;pend three times as much: We &s;eem to be pre|paring for it; but in the mean Time, don't let us avenge our blunders on the Proprietor. Sup|po&s;e that he has done wrong, in &s;elling his Lands too dear, or in re&s;erving &s;ome of the be&s;t to him&s;elf, how will the Matter be mended by geting a King's Governor? Shall we then make laws to force the Proprietor to take up the wor&s;t Land? (for he has a right to &s;ome) Or &s;hall we force him to &s;ell his property at whatever price we choo&s;e to give? Shall we prevent him from leting his friends have land? Or, &s;hall we force him to refund the four&s;core thou&s;and pounds which we gave to his Governors? Is he al&s;o to refund the thou&s;ands which Governor D&mdash; re|ceiv'd
<PB N="14" REF="009875_0013_0F7AD255AC5430B8">
as bribes, to injure the Proprietor? And be&s;ides that, is the new Governor, and all the retinue and dependants that may follow him, to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ed upon the air? If this be the &s;cheme, pur|&s;ue it on; but if the&s;e things be impracticable, I cannot &s;ee how we &s;hall get our pre&s;ent condi|tion mended.</P>
<P>I expect to be told, I am not well affected to his Maje&s;ty, as you &s;aid of &s;ome Pre&s;byterians t'other day at the State-Hou&s;e, becau&s;e they would not plunge them&s;elves blindly into your mea&s;ures: I &s;uppo&s;e, however, they are very in|different about &s;uch malicious accu&s;ations. In &s;pite of all you can &s;ay, his Maje&s;ty will judge of your loyalty, and theirs, according to the <HI>&s;ub|&s;tantial</HI> proofs you give of it, in time of danger; and not by your idle ga&s;conade at a State-hou&s;e. What under the heavens did your &s;peaker mean, by telling us that the Proprietor has made us all &s;laves, and will pre&s;ently bring our heads to the block? Can the Proprietor take away our lives, or our liberties? Have we not got a valuable Charter? Don't we make our own laws, and &s;it as juries to determine upon life and pro|perty, according to the&s;e laws? The danger is from another quarter; you are the per&s;ons that have made us &s;laves; you have depriv'd us of charter-privileges; have made laws for us, and have offer'd to deprive us of juries, &s;o that you might have the power to &s;pare our lives, or take them away, at plea&s;ure. Did the Proprietor
<PB N="15" REF="009875_0014_0F7AD2565E36C590">
ever attempt &s;uch a thing? You a&s;cribe all our contentions and trouble to the Proprietor, with the &s;ame ju&s;tice that you do our &s;lavery: Your non-re&s;i&s;ting principle began our troubles, and your ob&s;tinacy continued them. You refus'd to grant his Maje&s;ty &s;upplies in Governor THOMAS's time, but the Governor was obliged to take the men; and through ob&s;tinacy you &s;unk ten or twelve thou&s;and pounds. What &s;hare of blame had the Proprietor in that affair? When you had lo&s;t your hold in the corporation of this city, the Governor would not a&s;&s;i&s;t you to be aveng'd of your &s;ucce&s;&s;ors; for which you never forgave him. Was the Proprietor to be blam'd for that quarrel? In the beginning of the late French war, you plead con&s;cience, or unbelief, or &s;omething wor&s;e, and would grant no &s;up|plies. Was the Proprietor to blame there?&mdash; But the Proprietor urged you then &s;o hard, to come into &s;ome mea&s;ures of defence, that you never forgave him &s;ince. And as you were af|terwards obliged to grant &s;upplies, you re&s;olv'd to manage your cards &s;o as to give him but little ea&s;e.</P>
<P>And we contend, that if our A&s;&s;embly had, ten years ago, con&s;i&s;ted of men &s;incerely di&s;|po&s;ed to &s;erve his Maje&s;ty and their country, by defen&s;ive mea&s;ures, we might have avoided mo&s;t of all our quarrels with the Governor; and &s;hould at the &s;ame time have &s;av'd this province one hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds, at lea&s;t, and many thou&s;and lives.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="009875_0015_0F7AD2571467D8B0">How many thou&s;and pounds did it co&s;t us to get the Indians to charge the Proprietor with all our trouble?

<P>Sir W&mdash;M J&mdash;N, in his report of the&s;e proceedings, mentions &s;everal Quakers who had corre&s;ponded with the Indians, and been guilty of &s;everal &s;editious and trea&s;onable practices: Yet you are &s;till di&s;po&s;ed to fling all our calami|ties on the Proprietor. It is notorious that the Pro|prietor loo&s;es greatly by the depopulation and &s;lavery of the frontier counties; but you are the per&s;ons who gain by it; for the fewer the new counties are, the more likely the Quakers are to hold their power in this province.

It is a pity the change were not ea&s;y, from Quaker-Slavery to Briti&s;h-Liber|ty. For my part, I cannot &s;ee what you mean, by talking as if we were not already under his Maje&s;ty's government:&mdash; We conceive that we are under it; and are ready to &s;pend the la&s;t drop of blood, rather than &s;ubmit to any other Sovereign: That's more than you can &s;ay.&mdash;

The Proprietor is our Governor under the King, and he nominates a Lieutenant-Governor for his Maje&s;ty's approbation. Can this circum&s;tance ever be mended? It is impo&s;&s;ible his Maje&s;ty &s;hould be acquainted with the many thou&s;and of|ficers who are in his &s;ervice. Even in a King's government we mu&s;t expect to have a Governor whom &s;ome body has recommended to his Ma|je&s;ty. My Lord Some-body has a friend, who has a cou&s;in, who needs a place, or &s;tands in &s;ome other body's way: Him he recommends to the prime mini&s;ter, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and &s;o we may come by a Governor. And the que&s;tion now is, Who &s;hall recommend our Governor to his Maje&s;ty; &s;hall the Proprietor? who mu&s;t naturally be de|&s;irous of the growth of this province; or mu&s;t &s;ome Nobleman or other? who, perhaps, knows and cares little about it.</P>
<P>We have had one trial already of a Governor the Proprietor did not chu&s;e to recommend, <HI>i. e.</HI> Governor D&mdash;Y. We know he oblig'd you much: And a few &s;uch Governors would do for us all.&mdash;But the change of a Governor is not the only thing we are to expect; if we mu&s;t have a change, we &s;hall have a thorough one. For if we get a new government, the Parliament mu&s;t alter our Charter fir&s;t, and then we &s;hall have new privileges and new laws. We know what we have, and we can hardly get better, but we may get wor&s;e, when it will be too late to repent. It is very probable that we &s;hall &s;oon have &s;tamp-offices,

cu&s;toms, exci&s;es and duties enough to pay, we don't want to pay tythes into the bar|gain. &mdash;Our pre&s;ent Charter is a very good one, if you would &s;uffer the people to enjoy it: But you &s;eem re&s;olv'd to en&s;lave us, either in one go|vernment or another. You privately in&s;tructed your Agent in England, to make terms for you. You were preparing, like the <HI>unju&s;t &s;teward,</HI> that in ca&s;e you &s;hould be turn'd out of power in this government, you might immediately plunge us into a new government, where you &s;hould reign again: And doubtle&s;s a Quaker's finger would then be heavier than his loins have been hitherto. The an&s;wer that you got from Eng|land, was that you might be able to get the go|vernment changed,
<Q>The Quakers &s;till retain|ing their power.</Q>
A very comfortable an|&s;wer! &mdash;But if the people of this province &s;uf|fer you thus to lead them blind-fold into a new &s;y&s;tem, they will very well de&s;erve to be rid.&mdash; You have the power at pre&s;ent of making any laws for us that you plea&s;e, and you would re|tain the &s;ame power in the new government, for your &s;cheme is not to grant the frontier-counties any Repre&s;entatives before this change. Thus, bound hand and feet, we are to be delivered up!</P>
<P>If you are really de&s;irous to do this province a &s;ervice and make the people happy, your only way is to grant them their privileges, let them be fairly repre&s;ented in A&s;&s;embly; and then when they are free men, if they de&s;ire a change

of government, let them petition; but &s;ooner by no means.&mdash; Suffer me to &s;ay, that when there are petitions before the A&s;&s;embly from two or three thou&s;and frontier inhabitants, and more daily coming in, praying for redre&s;s of grievan|ces, that at &s;uch a time to pu&s;h for a new go|vernment, in&s;tead of letting the people be re|dre&s;s'd; &s;uch conduct, I &s;ay, and at &s;uch a time, will admit of con&s;tructions very di&s;honorable to your &s;ociety.</P>
<P>It is cruel to deprive people of their liberties, and when they cry for ju&s;tice, immediately to rai&s;e a counter-cry, and &s;et the province in a ferment about another affair, le&s;t the groans of the injur'd &s;hould be heard. Therefore, in&s;tead of li&s;tening to new &s;chemes, I am re&s;olv'd, and hope that every lover of this province and of liberty, will re&s;olve to li&s;ten to no propo&s;als for a change of government, until ju&s;tice is done to the in|jur'd, the oppre&s;s'd and groaning inhabitants of our frontier-counties.&mdash;</P>
