<P>The indictment charges the pri&s;oners a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the bar with the murder of <HI>William Little,</HI> and it is my duty to &s;tate to you, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;hall do to you as briefly as is con&s;i&s;tent with per&s;pecuity, the circum&s;tances and facts at|tending this ca&s;e, as we purpo&s;e to lay them before you in evidence. The unfortunate per&s;on, who&s;e death is the &s;ubject of the pre|&s;ent enquiry, was ma&s;ter of an American ve&s;|&s;el, called the <HI>Eagle,</HI> which &s;et off the 15th of September, in the la&s;t year, with a cargo of tobacco, bound for France; the &s;hip's com|pany at that time, con&s;i&s;ted of Capt. <HI>William Little,</HI> the decea&s;ed, and ten other per&s;ons, of whom three died, very &s;hortly after the ve&s;|&s;el quitted the harbour; there were left on board the ma&s;ter, and &s;even other per&s;ons, the two pri&s;oners at the bar, the two Span|iards,

whom you have &s;een produced at the bar, and three other per&s;ons, who will be produced to you as witne&s;&s;es, in &s;upport of this pro&s;ecution. Gentlemen, nothing mat|erial occured, in the pro&s;ecution of this vo|yage till on the 27th of October la&s;t; when at twelve o'clock at night, <HI>Little,</HI> the ma&s;ter, and three other per&s;ons on board, that will be produced as witne&s;&s;es, went below to &s;leep; on being relieved from their watch by the two pri&s;oners at the bar, and the two Spaniards. Gentlemen, on that night we charge that the de&s;truction of this unfortu|nate per&s;on, was effected, in the manner de|&s;cribed in the indictment; and we charge the pri&s;oner at the bar, Cole, with being the hand employed in this murder; and the pri&s;oner, Colley, with being the direc|tor, and the chief actor in this mur|derous con&s;piracy again&s;t him, and the two Spaniards with being aiding, abetting, a&s;&s;i&s;ting, comforting, and maintaining, the &s;aid Cole and Colley, to commit the &s;aid murder.

this bu&s;ine&s;s are tried &s;eparately.

<P>What did you under&s;tand by that?&mdash;I do not know; I did not know what it was; I thought we had ju&s;t &s;truck &s;oundings, and he had fallen off deck. Then I heard the captain &s;ay, "I am not dead, tho' you think I be."</P>
