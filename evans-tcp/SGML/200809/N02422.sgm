<P>THE &s;pecial Occa&s;ion that turn'd my Thoughts to this &s;ingular Text, mu&s;t be obvious to every one, acquainted with the pre&s;ent Situation of Affairs in this Flock: And to &s;uch, it's pre&s;um'd, I need make no Apology for being on &s;o peculiar a Subject to day.</P>
<P>The Con&s;ideration of this hi&s;torical Pa&s;&s;age might be introduc'd by &s;ome Remarks on the Context and
<PB N="2" REF="002871_0004_0FE67E8B16D34AD0">
Story it belongs to. But all I &s;hall ob&s;erve, is only this; That there being a Vacancy in the College of the Apo&s;tles, and &s;everal Candidates (called the one <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> or <HI>Bar&s;abas</HI>; the other <HI>Matthias</HI>) being &s;ingled out by the Church and nominated for that important Po&s;t, they refer'd it to the Determination of Heaven, by the &s;acred method of a Lot, which of them &s;hould be the Man to fill up that &s;uperior Station. An Expo&s;itor on the place ob&s;erves, <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mr.</HI> Henry.</NOTE> <Q>They were both &s;uch worthy Men, and &s;o well qualify'd, that none cou'd tell which of them was fitte&s;t, but all agreed it mu&s;t be one of them: Yet they did not propo&s;e them&s;elves, nor <HI>&s;trive</HI> for the place, but humbly &s;at &s;till, and were appointed to it.</Q> The Church having cho&s;en out and &s;et up the&s;e as Candidates, they carry'd the matter to the Throne of Grace, &s;preading the Ca&s;e before the Lord in Prayer, and then unanimou&s;ly appealing to Him by a Lot for Determination. The Sum of the Prayer upon this great Occa&s;ion, we have on Record in the Text, &mdash; <HI>They prayed and &s;aid, Thou Lord who knowe&s;t the hearts of all Men, &s;hew whether of tho&s;e two thou ha&s;t cho&s;en; that he may take part of this Mini&s;try.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall di&s;cour&s;e to the Words, under the&s;e Ob|&s;ervations.</P>
<P N="1">1. When &s;ome one is needed to fill up a Vacan|cy in the Mini&s;try, it &s;hou'd be the Care &amp; De&s;ire of all concerned, That the LORD JESUS CHRIST wou'd <HI>&s;hew whom He hath cho&s;en.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Application &s;hou'd be made to Him by <HI>earne&s;t Prayer</HI> in this important Ca&s;e.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="3" REF="002871_0005_0FE67E8C6A0B3AB8">3. CHRIST is to be con&s;ider'd by us at all times and in all matters, but e&s;pecially in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, <HI>as the Lord, who knows the Hearts of all Men.</HI></P>
<P>Finally, I might ob&s;erve, from the Intere&s;t the Eleven <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> had in the Appointment of one to fill up their Number, &amp; the Pattern they have left of a ju&s;t Concern and Forwardne&s;s before, and Satis|faction after the Choice; That it is a very de&s;irable thing to a faithful Mini&s;ter to have an agreeable <HI>Colleague,</HI> to be <HI>a Partner</HI> and <HI>Fellow-helper</HI> with him in his Charge: And that he will be di&s;pos'd glad|ly to <HI>receive</HI> &s;uch an one as a Brother, whom <HI>the Lord &s;heweth he has cho&s;en.</HI> &mdash; But I &s;hall di&s;mi&s;s this la&s;t Remark with barely mentioning it, and only in&s;i&s;t on the three former.</P>
<P><HI>DOCT. I.</HI> When &s;ome one is needed to be put into the Mini&s;try, and fill up a Vacancy in this Eccle&s;i|a&s;tical Order, it &s;hou'd be the Care and De&s;ire of all concern'd, <HI>That the LORD JESUS CHRIST wou'd &s;hew whom HE hath cho&s;en.</HI></P>
<P><HI>THOU Lord, &s;hew whether of the&s;e thou ha&s;t cho&s;en.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Per&s;on</HI> immediately addre&s;&s;ed to was mo&s;t probably the LORD JESUS CHRIST, who is Lord of all, and Head of the Church; who&s;e Prerogative it was to make Apo&s;tles, and who had before his A&s;cen&s;ion per&s;onally cho&s;en and appointed the Eleven.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mini&s;try</HI> intended in our Text, was more e&s;pecially the Apo&s;tle&s;hip; which is therefore added in the Text, &mdash; <HI>This Mini&s;try and Apo&s;tle&s;hip.</HI> &mdash; It hints to us this ju&s;t and u&s;eful Thought, (which in|deed might have been mention'd fir&s;t as a di&s;tinct Doctrine) That <HI>every Office in the Church of CHRIST is a Mini&s;try</HI>; the Apo&s;tle&s;hip it &s;elf was &s;o. Even CHRIST the Son of GOD, came to mini&s;ter: And
<PB N="4" REF="002871_0006_0FE67E8C912F5A60">
&s;hall the Servant be above his Lord? The Apo&s;tle &s;ays to Chri&s;tians, We preach JESUS CHRIST the LORD, and <HI>our &s;elves your Servants</HI> for JESUS &s;ake. And if the Apo&s;tles, who were extraordinary Men of God, &s;tiled their Work a Mini&s;try; much more may the Pa&s;toral Office be &s;o called, which is in its Nature ordinary, and in dignity inferior to the Apo&s;tolate.</P>
<P>The Mini&s;try is a common Name, which takes in all Offices in the Church, ordinary and extraordina|ry, higher or lower. It is particularly very often apply'd to ordinary <HI>Pa&s;tors</HI> and <HI>Teachers</HI>; and is grown by Cu&s;tom very much their &s;pecial Character and Denomination. They are &s;et in the Church for the work of the Mini&s;try: They are called to mini&s;|ter about holy things; are &s;eparated to the Mini&s;try of the Word; appointed to mini&s;ter the Go&s;pel of Salvation. Their Office indeed, as it is a Mini&s;try, relates more directly and properly to CHRIST, their only Lord and Ma&s;ter. However, in a Sen&s;e, they are Servants of the Church; as Magi&s;trates are Ser|vants of the Commonwealth, or as Angels are called mini&s;tring Spirits, &s;ent forth to mini&s;ter unto the Heirs of Salvation. Yet &s;uffer me to ob&s;erve, they are not &s;o the Church's Servants, as to be oblig'd only to obey their Orders, and execute their Votes and Decrees. But are call'd <HI>Guides</HI> and <HI>Over&s;eers</HI> of the Flock, and &s;aid to have <HI>the Rule</HI> over them. Not that they have Dominion <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> your Faith, or Power to tyranni&s;e over Con&s;cience, by human Im|po&s;itions, as Lords over God's Heritage; but are de|&s;ign'd to be En&s;amples to the Flock, and Helpers of your Joy, by a&s;&s;i&s;ting your Walk in the Faith and Order of the Go&s;pel: and &s;hou'd de&s;ire only by ma|nife&s;tation of the Truth, and humble Exerci&s;es of the Power which CHRIST has given them for Edification,
<PB N="5" REF="002871_0007_0FE67E92E62F15E0">
and not for De&s;truction, to commend them&s;elves to every Man's Con&s;cience in the &s;ight of GOD.</P>
<P>IT is only a <HI>Mini&s;terial</HI> and Stewardly Power, that is ve&s;ted in them; to be regulated in all its Operations, by the &s;acred Rules and In&s;tructions given in the Word of CHRIST. <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>N. B.</HI> The greate&s;t part of what is premis'd here, was for brevity omitted in the Pulpit; tho' its thought fit to in&s;ert it in the Print.</NOTE> From hence they mu&s;t learn how they ought to behave them&s;elves in the hou&s;e of GOD, and to govern their re&s;pective Charges; expecting no other Subjection and Obedience, from their People, than what it is the Will of CHRIST his Churches &s;hou'd render to &s;uch as have the Over|&s;ight of them. Altho' they &s;hou'd take Care not to betray the Authority of the Elder&s;hip; but be ju&s;t to their Commi&s;&s;ion, true to their Ma&s;ter, and &s;peak boldly in his name, according to his Word, teaching and warning every man, and as there is occa&s;ion, re|buking &s;ome &s;harply: Yet they mu&s;t take heed on the other hand, they don't make unju&s;t Encroach|ments on the Privileges of the Fraternity, but allow them their full Power of Con&s;ent and Liberty of Judgment, in Church-Admini&s;trations; in things proper taking their Concurrence, and ever u&s;ing the utmo&s;t Care to give no offence in any thing, that the Mini&s;try be not blamed. In particular they &s;hou'd beware of an unconde&s;cending Spirit, an unhappy Stiffne&s;s of Opinion, and re&s;olute Oppo&s;ition to the Brethren, in Ca&s;es of le&s;&s;er Importance, where (what|ever is pretended) Humour will &s;eem to govern them, more than Con&s;cience. It's true that by the Con&s;titution of the&s;e Churches a con&s;iderable Power is lodg'd in the Elders, in&s;omuch that it &s;eems they can put a <HI>Negative</HI> (for weighty Rea&s;ons) upon any Vote of the Fraternity, whether concerning Admi&s;&s;ions,

Di&s;mi&s;&s;ions, Cen&s;ures, or the like. For &s;o runs the la&s;t Paragraph in the tenth Chapter of our <HI>Platform</HI> of Church-Di&s;cipline; <Q>The ordinary Power of Government belonging only to the Elders, and the Power of Privilege remaining with the Bro|therhood, &mdash; It followeth, that in an organick Church, <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>By</HI> an organick Church, <HI>is meant (as our Synod in 62 have defin'd it, under Que&s;t. II.)</HI> A particular Congregation of vi&s;ible Saints in Go&s;pel-Order, furni&s;hed with a Presbytery, at lea&s;t with a teach|ing Elder, and walking together in Truth and Peace.</NOTE> and right Admini&s;tration, all Church-Acts proceed after the manner of a mixt Admi|ni&s;tration, &s;o as NO Church-Act CAN be con|&s;ummated or perfected without the Con&s;ent of <HI>Both.</HI></Q> &mdash; By which it appears, that as according to our Principles, the Elders are not to exerci&s;e Church-Power, but by the Con&s;ent of the Brethren; So neither is there any Church-Act in ordinary ca&s;es valid without the Sanction of the Elder&s;hip: And indeed the <HI>Platform</HI> &s;ays, in &s;o many words, <Q>That what the Churches are to act and do in the&s;e mat|ters, they <HI>are</HI> to do in a way of Obedience &mdash; to the Direction &mdash; of the Elders. <HI>Heb.</HI> 13.17. <HI>Obey them that have the Rule over you, and &s;ubmit your &s;elves</HI> &amp;c.</Q> Further, the eighth Paragraph is expre&s;s, <Q>Nor may they oppo&s;e and contradict the Judgment or Sentence of the Elders, without &s;ufficient and weighty Cau&s;e; becau&s;e &s;uch Practices are mani|fe&s;tly contrary unto Order and Government, and Inlets of Di&s;turbances, and tend to Confu&s;ion.</Q> And, as our famous Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> (one of the Fathers of <HI>New-England,</HI> and fir&s;t Teacher of this Church) has expounded our Platform in his celebrated Book of the <HI>Keys</HI>; the Power and Influence of the Pre&s;|bytery, both in the Church and in Synods or Coun|cils, &s;eems to me carry'd up to a greater Height con|&s;iderably,
<PB N="7" REF="002871_0009_0FE67E9611D041C8">
than is either u&s;ually practi&s;ed by Elders, or in fact allowed by the Brethren. However, it behoves them, as Mini&s;ters of the meek and lowly JESUS, as much as po&s;&s;ible, to deny them&s;elves; to deny their own Opinions, and Wills, and Rights, and &s;toop to the Infirmities of Men, and &s;ubmit to Things difficult enough to be borne, in many ca&s;es; upon the excellent Principles and Views that acted the fir&s;t Mini&s;ters of CHRIST, (2 <HI>The&s;&s;.</HI> 3.9.) <HI>Not becau&s;e we have not Power, but to make our &s;elves an En&s;ample unto you to follow us.</HI> &mdash; So 1 Cor. 9.12. <HI>We have not u&s;ed this Power, but &s;uffer all things, le&s;t we &s;hould hinder the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t.</HI> And 2 Cor. 6. <HI>In all things approving our &s;elves as the Mini&s;ters of GOD, in much Patience, in Afflictions, in Nece&s;&s;ities, in Tumults, under Honour and Di&s;honour, evil Report and good Report</HI> &amp;c. &mdash; They are not indeed to be the Servants of <HI>Men,</HI> &s;o as tamely and &s;ervilely to pro&s;titute their Authority to popular Humours, or Traditions of Fathers: Yet they mu&s;t let their Moderation be known to all Men, while they faith|fully execute the Commi&s;&s;ion they have receiv'd from CHRIST; and labour to be Examples of Meekne&s;s, Prudence and Conde&s;cention; becoming all things to all Men; plea&s;ing them for their Good to Edifi|cation; not &s;eeking their own Profit, but the Profit of Many, that they may be &s;aved; watching for Souls, as tho&s;e that mu&s;t give an Account, and con|&s;ider they are Stewards of the My&s;teries of GOD.</P>
<P>But I proceed to ob&s;erve as a further Preliminary. This Mini&s;terial Tru&s;t is peculiar to a <HI>di&s;tinct Order</HI> of Men, in&s;tituted by CHRIST and of &s;tanding U&s;e and Obligation.</P>
<P>The Mini&s;try was originally <HI>appointed</HI> by CHRIST; and de&s;ign'd, not for the Apo&s;tolick Age only, but to continue in the Church throughout all Ages; as
<PB N="8" REF="002871_0010_0FE67E9633ABD050">
might be argu'd, in that the Rea&s;ons of the In&s;titution are of a moral nature, and perpetual continuance; and al&s;o from tho&s;e Scriptures, which tell us, That CHRIST has &s;et Pa&s;tors and Teachers in his Church for the Work of the Mini&s;try, till we all come to a perfect Man; &mdash; That in the Lord's-Supper (the Admini&s;tration of which is their peculiar Province) CHRIST's Death mu&s;t &s;hewed forth until He come a|gain; &mdash; And that He has left a Promi&s;e to <HI>be with</HI> his Mini&s;ters (teaching and bapti&s;ing in his name) to the End of the World &amp;c.</P>
<P>And it is an Office peculiar to a <HI>di&s;tinct Order</HI> of Men. 'Tis a &s;acred Inclo&s;ure, &amp; do's not lie in Com|mon, for every one that plea&s;es, to invade and oc|cupy. All publick and &s;pecial Offices in the State are limited to particular Subjects: So is the Mini&s;try of the Go&s;pel. This Honour no Man taketh to him|&s;elf, but he that is called of GOD. A liberty of pro|phe&s;ying, as held by &s;ome, appears to me but an unlawful Licence, and tends to unhappy Con&s;equen|ces. The LORD is a GOD of Order, and not the Author of Confu&s;ion, but of Peace: and wou'd have all things done decently and in order, in all the Churches of the Saints. 'Tis &s;aid indeed, <HI>Covet to prophe&s;y, and forbid not to &s;peak with Tongues:</HI> If a Man be in&s;pir'd with miraculous Gifts, let him &s;peak. But otherwi&s;e let him be orderly call'd and &s;eparated to the Work. In ordinary Ca&s;es, a regular Election and &s;olemn Inve&s;titure into the Office are requir'd to the Exerci&s;e of it: So that without the&s;e Praerequi|&s;ites, even the preaching of the Word in a public and &s;tated manner (without de&s;ign or de&s;ire of engaging in the Mini&s;try, when call'd to Office) and much more the Admini&s;tration of Sacraments, mu&s;t be look'd upon as no &s;mall Irregularities. Not that the Power (&s;trictly &s;peaking) comes by Election, or Or|dination
<PB N="9" REF="002871_0011_0FE67EA016BA86F8">
of Men, but by a Charter or Commi&s;&s;ion from CHRIST open'd in the Go&s;pel: Yet tho&s;e human Actions are generally nece&s;&s;ary to the <HI>orderly exerci&s;e</HI> of Mini&s;terial Authority. A Power, and the Right to <HI>exerci&s;e</HI> that Power, are two things very di&s;tin|gui&s;hable: The former u&s;ually deriv'd by Commi&s;&s;i|on from &s;ome &s;uperior Authority; but the latter by a &s;olemn Inve&s;titure, done in many ca&s;es by Equals or Inferiors. 'Tis the Charter of a City or Laws of a Coun|try, that appoints all Offices, and their &s;everal Pow|ers and Bu&s;ine&s;&s;es: Yet that alone do's not intitle any individual Per&s;on to this or that Office, one more than another. But there is &s;omething further requir'd to put any into Place, and authori&s;e their a&s;&s;uming and exerci&s;ing public Tru&s;ts. Thus, in &s;ome ca&s;es, there mu&s;t be a particular Commi&s;&s;ion from the Government, and in others Election by the People: And in all ca&s;es there's u&s;ually a &s;olemn Oath admi|ni&s;ter'd to the Party cho&s;en or appointed, which is a nece&s;&s;ary introductive to the authentic performance of his Office. A Coun&s;ellour elect, tho' approv'd by the Chair, &s;its not at the Board, till he has accepted the Place, and taken the Oath of Fidelity. A Ju&s;tice, or other civil Officer, can't u&s;e his Power, till he's &s;worn in &s;olemn Form. The Commi&s;&s;ion or Election indi|gitates the Per&s;ons to whom the Law or Charter gives this or that Power: But it's his taking the Oath appointed, that properly inve&s;ts him in his Office, or introduces him into the public Exerci&s;e of it.</P>
<P>Even &s;o, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, The Power of a Go&s;|pel-Mini&s;ter originates and is founded intirely in the <HI>In&s;titution</HI> of &s;uch an Order of Per&s;ons, which our Lord was pleas'd to make, and has reveal'd in the Go&s;pel: Where He &s;tates their Duty, limits their Authority, and fixes their proper Character; which it is not left to the uncertain Humours of Men to vary
<PB N="10" REF="002871_0012_0FE67EA0357618A0">
from, add to, or dimini&s;h. So that to in&s;titute new Offices in the Church, or alter Offices divinely in&s;ti|tuted, by increa&s;ing or le&s;&s;ening their proper Powers, Qualifications, and Employments, is nothing &s;hort of a bold U&s;urpation of CHRIST's Prerogative, and a rude Reflection upon his governing Wi&s;dom, Good|ne&s;s and Fidelity.</P>
<P>Yet the In&s;titution requires &s;ome things preparato|ry to the <HI>Exerci&s;e</HI> of the Office: And in ordinary ca&s;es (whatever may be allow'd for ca&s;es of Nece&s;|&s;ity, which &s;eem to carry a &s;ufficient Warrant in them&s;elves) it mu&s;t be held contrary to Go&s;pel-Or|der, for any to exerci&s;e the Pa&s;toral Power (or any branch of the Mini&s;terial Office, except as Candidates or Probationers, occa&s;ionally) until &s;olemnly inve&s;ted with that Authority, and &s;eparated to that Work: Which is partly done by Election of the Church, and Laying on of the Hands of the Presbytery, and part|ly by a voluntary devout Self-con&s;ecration.</P>
<P>Now (to come to the Bu&s;ine&s;s before us) when the Appointment and Inve&s;titure of &s;ome one into the mini&s;terial Office is propos'd by a People, it &s;hou'd be the Care and De&s;ire of all concern'd, That the LORD JESUS CHRIST would <HI>&s;hew whom HE hath cho&s;en.</HI></P>
<P>In &s;peaking to this point, &s;everal Things may be briefly attempted. As (1.) to con&s;ider <HI>who</HI> is intend|ed by the Per&s;on whom CHRIST has <HI>cho&s;en.</HI> (2.) To inquire <HI>how</HI> or in what <HI>ways</HI> He doth <HI>&s;hew</HI> whom he has cho&s;en. (3.) To give the <HI>Rea&s;ons</HI> why it &s;hou'd be the <HI>Care</HI> and <HI>De&s;ire</HI> of a People, that CHRIST would &s;hew whom He hath cho&s;en.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>I am to con&s;ider</HI> Who <HI>is meant by the Per&s;on whom CHIRST has</HI> cho&s;en.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="002871_0013_0FE67EA15DAEA200">And here,</P>
<P N="1">1. It means in general one whom He <HI>approves</HI> as &s;utably qualify'd for the Mini&s;try, and in particular the Per&s;on whom He judges <HI>fitte&s;t</HI> for this place and people, and will <HI>own</HI> and <HI>ble&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>When we read of the <HI>Fa&s;t,</HI> which GOD hath <HI>cho|&s;en,</HI> it means &s;uch an one as He de&s;ires, approves of, and takes plea&s;ure in. When we read of the <HI>cho&s;en</HI> Men of I&s;rael, it means the <HI>Choice&s;t</HI> of their Tribes, the mightie&s;t and be&s;t Men they had. So a <HI>cho&s;en</HI> Generation, means an excellent Generation, the Lord's peculiar Trea&s;ure, a Generation of his Prai&s;e. &mdash; <HI>Mo|&s;es</HI> his <HI>Cho&s;en,</HI> is <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> his Beloved, in whom is an excellent Spirit, and in whom is his Delight. When we read <HI>Mat.</HI> 22.14. Many are called, <HI>but few are cho&s;en</HI>; it may be expounded by <HI>ver.</HI> 8. <HI>They which were bidden, were not worthy.</HI> So 1 Pet. 2.6. <HI>Behold, I lay in Zion a chief Corner-&s;tone, Elect, Precious</HI>:&mdash;(ver. 5.)

<P>The Word of the LORD a&s;&s;ures us, that Men are prede&s;tinated according to the Purpo&s;e of Him, who worketh all things after the coun&s;el of his own Will.

<P>And here it may be ob&s;erved; He &s;hews this &s;ometimes in extraordinary ways, and &s;ometimes by more ordinary means.</P>
<P N="1">I. He has &s;ometimes &s;hewn it in an <HI>extraordinary</HI> manner, by an <HI>immediate</HI> Call.</P>
<P>Thus, <HI>Aaron</HI> was made a Prie&s;t by the expre&s;s De&s;ignation of GOD him&s;elf. <HI>Samuel</HI> and the Pro|phets in old time, were call'd in uncommon ways, by heavenly Vi&s;ions and In&s;pirations. &mdash; So the Apo&s;tles under the Go&s;pel-Di&s;pen&s;ation. Our LORD in the days of his fle&s;h, per&s;onally nominated his fir&s;t Mini&s;|ters, and orally &s;hew'd whom he had cho&s;en. See <HI>Mark</HI> 3.13, 14. &mdash; Again, When he ro&s;e from the Dead, he renew'd his Commi&s;&s;ion to the Apo&s;tles, and after his A&s;cen&s;ion confirm'd their Call in an extra|ordinary manner, when they <HI>receiv'd Power from on high,</HI> as we read <HI>Acts</HI> 3. &mdash; So He appear'd to <HI>Saul</HI> in a miraculous Vi&s;ion, to make him a Mini&s;ter, and call'd him by a Voice from the excellent glory; as in <HI>Acts</HI> 26.13 &mdash;</P>
<P>And be&s;ides the Apo&s;tles, many in the Apo&s;tolic Age, receiv'd immediate Calls to the Mini&s;try; among whom were in&s;pired Prophets and Evangeli&s;ts. And perhaps oftentimes the Humane Call and the Divine Call, both met in one. It &s;hou'd &s;eem, <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> were In&s;tances of this. See <HI>Acts</HI> 13.2. and 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4.14.</P>
<P>But we are not now-a-days to look for extraordina|ry Calls: be&s;ure not &s;uch as are <HI>neither of Men, nor by Men.</HI> If any pretend to an immediate Mi&s;&s;ion from Heaven, let them confirm their Pretences, by evident Miracles and Prophecies; or we can't think they come with &s;ufficient Credentials.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="14" REF="002871_0016_0FE67EAA469A98F8">2. The LORD u&s;ually &s;hews whom He hath cho&s;en in more <HI>ordinary</HI> ways, by a <HI>mediate</HI> Call.</P>
<P>He &s;hews it by the voice of his Providence and Spirit, in more common methods of di&s;covery.</P>
<P>Under the old Te&s;tament, Men were in&s;tated in the Prie&s;thood by <HI>a Law of carnal Generation.</HI> GOD appointed the Po&s;terity of <HI>Aaron</HI> to this Office, and the Succe&s;&s;ion went by natural Birth.</P>

They are not confin'd to one particular Tribe or Family; but may <HI>chu&s;e out of all the People.</HI></P>
<P>Here I &s;hall &s;ay di&s;tinctly, (1.) The Matter is u&s;u|ally to be referr'd to a voluntary Election by <HI>Vote,</HI> or Human Agreement. Yet (2.) in &s;ome ca&s;es, it may be determin'd by the &s;pecial medium of a Divine <HI>Lot.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. The Matter is u&s;ually refer'd to voluntary <HI>Elec|tion,</HI> and Determination by VOTE: And when &s;o, there mu&s;t be &s;uch a Concurrence of Circum&s;tances, as to render the Call plain and clear, if we would know <HI>whom CHRIST has cho&s;en.</HI></P>
<P>I might premi&s;e here, It is a principle profe&s;&s;ed among us, that the Churches of CHRIST have in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e a power of Election; the Liberty to vote for their own Officers. In defence of which it's urg'd that the very Apo&s;tles wou'd not appoint &s;o much <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Deacons, to &s;erve Tables, without the expre&s;s Suffrage of the People. (See <HI>Acts</HI> 6. <HI>begin.)</HI> And it's argu'd, from <HI>Acts</HI> 14.23. Where we are told, <HI>They ordained them Elders in every Church</HI>; That the Di&s;ciples were allow'd the &s;ame Liberty and Privilege in the Choice of their Pa&s;tors: The original word for <HI>ordained,</HI> &s;ig|nifying in its fir&s;t political u&s;e, to de&s;ign or con&s;titute any Per&s;on an Officer by common Con&s;ent, which was u&s;ually expre&s;s'd by lifting up the hand. <Q>The

word is but once more u&s;ed in the New Te&s;ta|ment, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 8.19. where it plainly &s;ignifies Elec|tion to an Employment.</Q> &mdash; Speaking of &s;ome very worthy and famous Mini&s;ter, the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, <HI>Who was</HI> cho&s;en <HI>of the Churches to travel with us.</HI> But not to dwell upon this Argument; it is undi&s;|puted, that even in the Choice of an <HI>Apo&s;tle,</HI> to fill up the Twelve, the Di&s;ciples (being in number about 120 met together in one Body) were allow'd to come &s;o near as to <HI>appoint</HI> the Candidates; any <HI>two</HI> from among them&s;elves, whom they judg'd meete&s;t for the place; and then they (together with the Apo&s;tles pre&s;ent) having fir&s;t pray'd, <HI>gave forth their Lots</HI> for the particular Per&s;on.

But We have no Lei&s;ure at pre&s;ent to recite what is &s;aid on the&s;e &s;everal heads.</P>
<P>All I have further to do here, is to limit and qua|lify the method in common u&s;e among us: And wou'd &s;ay, In order to a di&s;covery of the Mind of CHRIST, or knowing whom the LORD has cho&s;en, a People mu&s;t &s;ee to it that their <HI>Election he regulat|ed
<PB N="16" REF="002871_0018_0FE67EAE4879C4F0">
according to his revealed Will, and the Call plain and clear, fair and orderly.</HI></P>
<P>Now to this End,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Some things are requir'd on the part of the <HI>Electing</HI> Body or Fraternity.</P>
<P>For In&s;tance, This mu&s;t be rightly <HI>con&s;tituted</HI>; con|&s;i&s;ting of Per&s;ons duly qualify'd to act in the affair. They that chu&s;e mu&s;t be rightful <HI>Members</HI> of the Church of CHRIST. This is made nece&s;&s;ary, by <HI>our</HI> Scheme of Church-Order, to qualify Per&s;ons to vote in chu&s;ing a Mini&s;ter: And for it, we have the Countenance of Scripture, particularly in the famous Example before us. They that <HI>appointed the Two,</HI> as Candidates for the Choice in our Text, were all <HI>Di&s;|ciples</HI>: By which Name the Body of Believers in that day were commonly call'd, in di&s;tinction from the Twelve. The <HI>Two</HI> were cho&s;en, as the <HI>Seven</HI> are &s;aid to be, by <HI>the multitude of the Di&s;ciples.</HI> And we are told how many were pre&s;ent at the Choice of <HI>Matthias:&mdash; The number of the Names were about an hundred and twenty:</HI> who are de&s;crib'd as <HI>Men which had a&s;&s;ociated with the Apo&s;tles, all the time that the Lord</HI> JESUS <HI>went in and out among them.</HI> They were open and known Di&s;ciples of CHRIST, who had confe&s;&s;ed Him before the World, and communicated in the &s;pecial Ordinances of his Kingdom. They are repre&s;ented afterwards (together with others ad|ded to them) as <HI>continuing in the Apo&s;tles Doctrine and Fellow&s;hip, and in breaking of Bread</HI>&mdash;. It &s;eems they were all in full Communion, and approv'd Chri&s;|tians: Not any Per&s;ons among them, of a &s;candalous Character, or an incomplete Profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Now, from this leading Example, it's thought, we may learn who are proper Subjects of the Liberty and Power of Election in the Cafe before us; Name|ly, the avow'd Members of a Go&s;pel-Church, &s;tated|ly a&s;&s;ociating therewith in all public Wor&s;hip and
<PB N="17" REF="002871_0019_0FE67EB8228C0268">
Ordinances. &mdash; And indeed it's judg'd &s;carce ratio|nal, that any &s;hou'd be admitted to vote in a Com|munity, or confederate Body, of which they are not orderly and confe&s;&s;ed Members. Hence if there be any &s;uch di&s;tinct Society as a congregational Church, in&s;tituted in Scripture, it's thought a Principle found|ed in Rea&s;on and the Nature of things, That none but approv'd Members of this particular Body, have a ju&s;t Right to vote in their Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Affairs, e&s;pecially in a ca&s;e of &s;uch peculiar Con|cern and Importance to the Peace, Purity, and Wel|fare of the Church, as that of chu&s;ing a Pa&s;tor to watch over their Souls, and break the Bread of Life to them. It's pleaded by our Divines, that if we ex|tend the Privilege beyond tho&s;e Limits, we &s;hall not ea&s;ily know where to &s;top: Whether in re&s;pect of the Per&s;ons who mu&s;t be admitted to this Privilege, or of other Privileges that &s;uch Per&s;ons may as rea&s;onably lay Claim to. And it is ob&s;erved, That &s;ome of the main Arguments for &s;tretching this Liberty further (and in particular, that of contributing to the Mi|ni&s;ter's Maintenance) will if pur&s;u'd in their ge|nuine Con&s;equences, carry the thing to a Length, that few, even of them who di&s;like the Limi|tation among us, will care to have it brought to. Now it's a known Maxim, That Argument that proves too much, proves e'en nothing to the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>To proceed,</P>
<P><HI>Another</HI> thing is, The Church mu&s;t &s;ee to it, that there be a due <HI>Examination</HI> and <HI>Trial</HI> had of the Candidates for Office among them. It is expre&s;ly requir'd in the ca&s;e of a Deacon, that the Per&s;on be <HI>fir&s;t proved</HI> (try'd and approbated) <HI>then let him u&s;e the Office.</HI> (1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.10.) Now &s;urely it's of great|er Con&s;equence, that Elders and Teachers pa&s;s under a proper Trial: &amp; this not only with regard to their gene|ral Qualifications for the Mini&s;try, but e&s;pecially as
<PB N="18" REF="002871_0020_0FE67EB845B326F8">
to their Fitne&s;s and Accommodation unto this Church and Place in particular. It &s;eems rea&s;onable that Chri&s;tians &s;hou'd judge for them&s;elves, in this ca&s;e. And who ordinarily are like to pa&s;s a better Judgment than the Church concern'd? They that were able in the Apo&s;tles day to <HI>look out</HI> among them&s;elves, for the Deacons Office, Men of <HI>hone&s;t Re|port, full of the holy Gho&s;t, and of Wi&s;dom,</HI> &s;eem to me &s;ufficiently capable of judging upon the Meetne&s;s of Per&s;ons for the Pa&s;toral Care al&s;o. And are they not in many Places of Scripture expre&s;ly directed and ex|horted to <HI>try the Spirits,</HI> whether they are of GOD; to <HI>beware of fal&s;e Prophets,</HI> that come to them in Sheeps clothing, but inwardly are ravening Wolves, whom they &s;hou'd know by their fruits; and if any Man preach <HI>any other Go&s;pel</HI> unto them, than they have re|ceiv'd, to hold him <HI>accur&s;ed.</HI> If there come any unto you, and bring not <HI>this Doctrine</HI> (&s;aith the Apo&s;tle) receive him not into your hou&s;e, neither bid him <HI>GOD &s;peed.</HI> It's ob&s;ervable, the <HI>Bereans</HI> are com|mended for trying of <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Silas</HI>'s Doctrine by the Scriptures. And the Church of <HI>Ephe&s;us</HI> is com|mended for <HI>trying them which &s;aid they were Apo&s;tles.</HI> The&s;e Scriptures (together with the Rea&s;on of the thing) appear to me a &s;ufficient foundation for the common Cu&s;tom among us of a popular Trial of Candidates. And if be&s;ides the u&s;ual Probation by public Preaching (which is more &s;ubject to Mi&s;takes) there were al&s;o private inquiries, e&s;pecially by per|&s;onal Conference, it might be of great U&s;e and Be|nefit: Though this kind of Exploration &s;eems to be|long more particularly to the Presbytery of the Church, if there be any &s;uch before in&s;tated.

For as the Prophet &s;peaks, <HI>Can two walk together, except they be agreed?</HI> &mdash; It is ob&s;ervable, the Vote and Lot in the De&s;ignati|on of <HI>Matthias</HI> were manag'd in the Pre&s;ence and under the Conduct of the Apo&s;tles.

But whether this be a &s;tanding Right of the Elder&s;hip, or whether they have no more than the Liberty of common Suffrage, I li&s;t not to di&s;pute.

If they love one another, and agree well together, they will &s;trengthen one ano|ther in their Work: But if they di&s;agree, this will tend to weaken their Hands, and di&s;courage their Hearts more than a little. "Churches therefore ought, what in them lies, to &s;uit their Neighbor|ing Mini&s;ters and Churches, in the Choice of a Mini&s;ter: Remembring they are not only to chu&s;e an Officer for them&s;elves, but a Neighbour for Them.</P>
<P>And certainly then it is advi&s;eable that the <HI>Congre|gation</HI> (as we di&s;tingui&s;h) or Body of Noncommu|nicants (being baptis'd Profe&s;&s;ors, a&s;&s;ociating con|&s;tantly in the Word and Prayer, with the Church concern'd) &s;hou'd have &s;ome Regard &s;hewn to them in this Affair; &s;urely at lea&s;t, as much as is due to any Chri&s;tian Neighbours.

<P>But however the&s;e things be, &s;urely a <HI>Trial</HI> ought to be made, by one means or other, &s;ufficient for the Church more immediately concern'd, to form a ma|ture Judgment upon; that there may be no place for <HI>Jude</HI>'s Complaint, <HI>There are certain Men</HI> (fal&s;e Teach|ers) <HI>crept in unawares.</HI> It behoves them to <HI>take Coun&s;el together,</HI> for imparting Light to one another, in a way free from all Party-De&s;igns and Artifices;

<P>And the Re&s;ult mu&s;t be a <HI>general</HI> Union of Hearts in a <HI>free</HI> and <HI>voluntary</HI> Choice, made without any Collu&s;ion or Con&s;traint; without all deceitful or vio|lent Mea&s;ures, to flatter or force on a Vote for any<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;tories inform (as one ob&s;erves) That in ancient Times the Choo&s;ers of Over&s;eers (or Pa&s;tors) gave with their Voice &s;olemn A&s;&s;everation or Oath, that their Choice was wholly free, and not the fruit of undue Influence.</NOTE>. A willing Concurrence of the Majority of the Church is nece&s;&s;ary, by all the Rules of Society, to a deter|mining Vote: And the more of Unanimity, the clearer Di&s;covery is made of CHRIST's Mind and Will; e&s;pecially when Per&s;ons of Eminence and Di&s;|tinction (for their Gifts and Graces, rather than worldly Abilities) are concurring in the Choice.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> There are &s;ome things requir'd on the part of the <HI>Candidates</HI> in view, to make them capable Subjects of an Election. There are certain Qualifi|cations, indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary to this End, to be re&s;pected by the Chu&s;ers.</P>

the Mini&s;try, a general De&s;ignation of the Per&s;ons to be called to it, is made by CHRIST him&s;elf: But where this is <HI>wholly</HI> wanting (&s;ays One <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dr.</HI> Owen.</NOTE>) it is not in the Power of any Church under Heaven, by virtue of any outward Order or Act, to com|municate Pa&s;toral or Mini&s;terial Power unto any Per&s;on whatever.</Q> So on the other hand, Per&s;ons may have a competent portion of Mini&s;terial Gifts; and yet being habitually aver&s;e to the Work, and re&s;olutely engag'd for &s;ome other Employment, or di&s;pos'd to this only for worldly Ends, if the&s;e things be known, it can't be proper to chu&s;e any &s;uch: And in either ca&s;e the Call is not clear. Something like the Spirit of the old Prophets, to whom <HI>the Word of the</HI> LORD, <HI>came</HI> and was in their Hearts <HI>as a burn|ing Fire,</HI> begetting an ardent Thir&s;t after the Glory of GOD, and good of Souls, is one con&s;iderable &s;tep towards a Divine Call.

For as the LORD looketh on the <HI>Heart</HI>: So mu&s;t we, as far as it is di&s;coverable; though &s;till we mu&s;t beware of uncharitable evil Surmi&s;ings. But if a Man plain|ly di&s;covers a &s;trong Bent to any civil or &s;ecular Employment, it is unadvi&s;ed to make Choice of &s;uch an one for the Mini&s;try.

I may add, if one in general &s;incerely inclin'd, is invited to this or that particular Station in the Mini&s;try, and cannot find a Heart (even after &s;erious Inquiry and humble Prayer) to comply, I &s;ee not that the Call of any

<P>And when there is thus a Sufficiency of Gifts and Qualifications, and a &s;utable Inclination in the Can|didate, concurring with an unanimous or general Agreement of a Chri&s;tian People (both Fraternity and Presbytery) in the Election and Approbation of him; e&s;pecially if al&s;o there be the Concurrence of Neighbour-Elders &amp; Churches; here's &s;uch an a&s;&s;em|blage or conjunction of happy Circum&s;tances, as ren|ders the Call &s;trong and valid, and &s;eems clearly to point out the Per&s;on <HI>whom CHRIST has cho&s;en.</HI> In ordinary ca&s;es, the regular Vote of a Church (en|forc'd by &s;uch a general De&s;ire and Agreement on all &s;ides) is look'd upon as the Voice of GOD, by which He calls Men forth to Service in his Church.

Sen&s;e, for any kind of <HI>Reference</HI> made to GOD, though in a way that implies the Contrivance and Activity of Men, and requires only a Divine Influ|ence to direct their Thoughts and Powers, in order to the Event. In which &s;en&s;e the <HI>Vote</HI> of any Body of Men, may be call'd a Lot. But yet &s;trictly &s;peak|ing, the Lot is an awful Appeal to Heaven, in &s;uch a way and manner as &s;huts out human Coun&s;el and Influence, and depends on a &s;pecial Agency of Di|vine Providence, for the actual determining of an Event. <HI>Prov.</HI> 16.33. <HI>The Lot is ca&s;t into the Lap; but the whole Di&s;po&s;ing thereof is of the</HI> LORD. The Judg|ment's the LORD's. "The Event, though ca&s;ual to Men, is directed and determin'd by GOD's Coun&s;el and Providence", which controuls and governs in all Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>The Lot was an Ordinance of GOD much in U&s;e under the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Di&s;pen&s;ation, for Deci&s;ion of Right in uncertain ca&s;es, and putting an I&s;&s;ue to weighty Matters depending, which were not with facility de|terminable in any other way. Thus the Land of <HI>Ca|naan</HI> was divided to the &s;everal Tribes by Lot. (<HI>Numb.</HI> 26.55, 56.) The Scape-goat was cho&s;en by Lot. <HI>(Lev.</HI> 16.7.) The Lot was made u&s;e of, in de|tecting of &s;ecret Criminals: as in the ca&s;e of <HI>Achan</HI> (<HI>Jo&s;h.</HI> 7.16.) And of <HI>Jonah</HI> (<HI>Jon.</HI> 1.7.) And of <HI>Jonathan</HI> (1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 14.42.) The Method of a Lot was taken to determine the Time, when each Family &s;hould bring in their <HI>Quota</HI> of Wood for the Service of the Temple, after the <HI>Jews</HI> Return from their Captivity: And who of the People &s;hou'd go up out of the Villages and Cities of <HI>Judah,</HI> to dwell at <HI>Jeru|&s;alem,</HI> where the Rulers re&s;ided, and the Hou&s;e of GOD was in building, and where they wou'd be mo&s;t expos'd to the Malice and Envy of their Ad|ver&s;aries: It's &s;aid, <HI>The People ca&s;t Lots, to bring one of Ten, to dwell there.

<P><PB N="26" REF="002871_0028_0FE67EC94D7177A0">In a word, this Method was us'd in the Election of Per&s;ons to Office; as in the ca&s;e of <HI>Saul</HI> cho&s;en King of <HI>I&s;rael.</HI> (1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 10.19 &mdash;) So of the <HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Leontes,</HI> whom King <HI>David</HI> di&s;tributed in|to many di&s;tinct Companies or Cour&s;es (as well as the <HI>Militia</HI> of the Kingdom.) <HI>They ca&s;t Lots</HI> for every Po&s;t and Service, as well the &s;mall as the great, ac|cording to the hou&s;e of their Fathers; as you have the Account at large in 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 24<HI>th</HI> Chapter and onwards. &mdash;</P>
<P>And it's remarkable, the fir&s;t Election of any Per|&s;on into Office in the Chri&s;tian Church (wherein there was any thing of the ordinary Acting or Influ|ence of Men) <HI>viz.</HI> that which our Text relates to, was con&s;ummated or perfected by a Lot. Indeed there was a previous Nomination of Two, by Suffrage or Vote of the whole Multitude: But the Determi|nation of the particular Per&s;on <HI>(whether of the&s;e two)</HI> they for very good Rea&s;ons put upon a different I&s;|&s;ue, and appealed to Heaven by a &s;olemn Lot.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Manner</HI> of this Lot, we are left at an uncertainty: Though &s;ome tell us <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vid. <HI>Whirby</HI> in loc.</NOTE> "They put two Lots into two Urns, or Ballot-boxes; the one con|taining the two Names of <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> and <HI>Matthias,</HI> the other the Name of an <HI>Apo&s;tle,</HI> and a Blank or void Lot; and then drawing forth the Name of <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> out of one Urn, and the void Lot out of t' her, they knew that the Lot remaining with the Name of an <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> upon it, belong'd to <HI>Matthias.</HI></P>
<P>As to the <HI>Rea&s;ons</HI> or &s;pecial Grounds of their ca&s;t|ing the Lot in this ca&s;e, neither are we particularly inform'd of them.

<PB N="27" REF="002871_0029_0FE67ECBD327CF00">
immediate Di&s;po&s;ition of him into his Office, by GOD, was nece&s;&s;ary to give him Apo&s;tolical Authority: or whether it was done upon no other than the com|mon moral Rea&s;ons, which influenced in the ca&s;es above-mention'd, in old Te&s;tament-times; I &s;hall not enter into any Debate.</P>
<P>The late excellent Mr. <HI>Henry</HI> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Vid. <HI>Expo&s;.</HI> 1 Chro. 24.</NOTE> &s;eems to have been of the Judgment, that the Lot in the&s;e ca&s;es was <HI>pre|&s;idential.</HI></P>
<P>So the memorable Mr. <HI>Baxter,</HI> who&s;e Words up|on the place <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vid.</HI> Paraphr.</NOTE> are; <Q>I know no Rea&s;on why the&mdash; Pa&s;tors of the Church (at lea&s;t in ca&s;es of doubt) &s;hou'd not now be <HI>&s;o</HI> cho&s;en,</Q> i. e. by Lot.</P>
<P>What the Judgment and Practice of Antiquity was, I have not had Lei&s;ure particularly to inform my &s;elf. Only I'll give you a Pa&s;&s;age out of <HI>The Order of the Go&s;pel</HI> (by the late venerable Dr. <HI>Mather</HI>) where he has the following words: <Q>Nothing is more evident than that in the fir&s;t Ages of the Church, Pa&s;tors were cho&s;en by all and on|ly their Flocks: In chu&s;ing a Mini&s;ter, they did <HI>Clerozein,</HI> that is, Chu&s;e him by <HI>Lot</HI>; from whence it was that Mini&s;ters had the Name of <HI>Clergy</HI> given to them<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Page 69.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>All I would &s;ay upon the Lot in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, give me Leave to offer in the following Hints. And allow me the freedom of young <HI>Elihu,</HI> in &s;aying <HI>Hearken to me, I al&s;o will &s;hew my Opinion.</HI></P>
<P>As to the <HI>Lawfulne&s;s</HI> of a Lot, for determining in this Ca&s;e, if under a ju&s;t Regulation, I pre&s;ume no one will di&s;pute it, that doth allow of the practice in civil Ca&s;es. "And it is hardly imaginable that GOD &s;hou'd not have left that lawful, which is &s;o evidently nece&s;&s;ary to the Peace and Security of Mankind, and which
<PB N="28" REF="002871_0030_0FE67ECC01A1FBE8">
the unavoidable Condition of human Affairs makes of &s;uch great and eminent U&s;e to the World."</P>
<P>And now for the <HI>Expediency</HI> of it in Ca&s;es &s;acred, particularly in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, under &s;ome &s;pe|cial Circum&s;tances, which frequently happen, I &s;up|po&s;e much might be ea&s;ily &s;aid, and &s;trongly argu'd.</P>
<P>In general, it is a Ca&s;e of no little <HI>Importance;</HI> &s;uch as will bear us out in applying &s;o awful a Me|thod for Determination. The Lot is a thing <HI>holy</HI> and <HI>reverend</HI>: and to u&s;e it in a ludicrous or wanton manner, about Trifles, and Matters of &s;mall moment, is a Folly in I&s;rael, judg'd to be no le&s;s than <HI>taking the Name of the</HI> LORD <HI>in vain.</HI> But the ca&s;e before us is of va&s;t weight and &s;olemn con&s;ideration: &s;uch as calls for the mo&s;t &s;erious Treatment from Men; and wherein, if in any matter at all (the Honour of CHRIST being &s;o nearly concern'd in it) we may hope that the Lord will own and accept the Appeal made to Him, and give an an&s;wer of Peace.</P>
<P>Moreover, It's often a <HI>doubtful</HI> Ca&s;e, and attended with no &s;mall degree of Uncertainty. Many times the ca&s;e is like that in the Story of our Text: Se|veral Candidates pre&s;ent, who are very worthy and de&s;irable for their Accompli&s;hments, and &s;o recom|mend them&s;elves by their public Performances, as well as private Conver&s;ation, that a People are will|ing it &s;hou'd be either of them, and agree it &s;hall be one, or at lea&s;t &s;uppo&s;e it will, and yet &s;carce know where (many of them) to pitch their ultimate Choice. Now in doubtful ca&s;es, what more proper method for Determination than a religious Lot? Indeed in things already determin'd by a clear Revelation of the Mind of CHRIST in holy Scripture, or very appa|rent to human Rea&s;on, and capable of being ea&s;ily determin'd by a little &s;erious and impartial Con&s;ide|ration; here there's no occa&s;ion for &s;uch an extraor|dinary
<PB N="29" REF="002871_0031_0FE67ED2F66775B0">
method: And if there be no occa&s;ion, it will be judg'd but profane trifling with the Name of CHRIST, to appeal to him by a Lot.&mdash;But where there is real Uncertainty, and &s;ober Doubt, or a Variety of Apprehen&s;ions among the Parties concern'd in an important Ca&s;e (important whether in regard of its Nature, or its Con&s;equences) and there be little Pro|bability of a peaceable I&s;&s;ue by any other means; then ca&s;t the Lot, for a Re&s;olution of the Doubt.</P>
<P>In fine, the ca&s;e before us is many times attend|ed with a great deal of <HI>Difficulty</HI>; and the divid|ed Sentiments among a People do too often, for want of &s;ome happy means of Accommodation, at la&s;t throw them into great Contentions and Di&s;orders.</P>
<P>Among a number of Candidates, there's generally &s;een a Diver&s;ity of Gifts and Talents: And hence, a|mong a People, as there is a variety of Ta&s;tes and Judgments, &s;o in con&s;equence hereof, there's u&s;ually a difference of Choice and Inclination; one being determin'd for this, and another for that &mdash;. And now as Men are commonly very much di&s;pos'd to be fond of their own Opinion or Fancy; &s;o this by a natural efficacy makes them the more wedded in their Affections, and re&s;olv'd in their Choice; that they can't tell how to brook a Di&s;appointment. Hence they are too often put upon &s;ini&s;ter Methods to ob|tain their Ends: or if balk'd of their Expectations, are carry'd into inordinate Re&s;entments and conten|tious Mea&s;ures. Such is the remaining Infirmity in the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t of Men, and &s;uch the Subtilty and Power of our grand Adver&s;ary the Devil (who goes about, as a roaring Lion, to devour and to di&s;|turb) That through the ju&s;t Judgment and Permi&s;&s;i|on of Providence, the Peace of the Churches is oft-times mi&s;erably broken, in pur&s;uit of unrea&s;onable Prejudices on the one hand, or of a fond Opinion and extravagant Affection on the other; while <HI>they

For want of a wi&s;e Conduct, popular Votes and Choices are too often attended with ungodly Strifes and Emulations. Now as the Apo&s;tle ob&s;erves, Where <HI>Envying and Strife</HI> prevail, there is <HI>Confu&s;ion</HI> and <HI>every evil work.</HI> And then &s;uch Divi&s;ions are difficult to be heal'd.

We may apply here that of <HI>Solomon, &mdash; A Brother offended, is harder to be won than a &s;irong City, and their Contentions are like the Bars of a Ca&s;tle.</HI> Hence then in this critical ca&s;e it greatly behoves a People to <HI>&s;tudy</HI> for Quietne&s;s, to <HI>follow</HI> the Things that make for <HI>Peace</HI>; and if it be po&s;&s;ible, manage &s;o as to &s;ecure this. <HI>The beginning of Strife, is as when one letteth out Water</HI>: When it has got &s;ome little Vent, it will it &s;elf widen the Breach, and in a little time grow irre&s;i&s;tible, if &s;peedy care be not taken to put a &s;top to it. <HI>Therefore</HI> &s;ays the wi&s;e Man, <HI>leave off Contention before it be meddled with.</HI></P>
<P>Now, what more effectual Method to this End, (that is, to leave off Contention <HI>before</HI> it be meddled with) can be us'd, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, than that of a religious <HI>Lot?</HI> The Lot, every one that has any thing in him &s;erious, looks upon as &s;acred and vene|rable.

<P>The Apo&s;tle ob&s;erves, <HI>An Oath</HI> for Confirmation, is to Men an <HI>End of all Strife.</HI> And agreeable is that Remark of <HI>Solomon,</HI> Prov. 18.18. <HI>The</HI> Lot <HI>cau&s;|eth Contentions to cea&s;e,</HI> and <HI>parteth between the mighty.</HI> Here the Wi&s;e Man hints the <HI>right</HI> application of the Lot, <HI>viz.</HI> In difficult and doubtful Ca&s;es, to pre|vent or end Contentions. <Q>By telling us what <HI>is</HI>

If either of the Per&s;ons propos'd are known to be di&s;|qualify'd by any e&s;&s;ential Defects, whether in point of Knowledge, Faith, or Morals; it is but a profane mocking and tempting of CHRIST, to draw the Lot:
<PB N="33" REF="002871_0035_0FE67EDC81607290">
and therefore unlawful to put the Matter to &s;uch an I&s;&s;ue. It is but as <HI>Haman</HI>'s Lot for the chu&s;ing &s;ome lucky day to accompli&s;h a wicked De&s;ign: Or as the <HI>Soldiers</HI> impious Lot for our SAVIOUR's &s;eamle&s;s Coat (&s;o fam'd for its miraculous Virtue) which cou'd give none of them a ju&s;t Propriety.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Lot mu&s;t be employ'd in a <HI>&s;olemn</HI> and <HI>re|ligious</HI> manner.</P>
<P>Being a practical Appeal to Heaven, it's but fit the Matter &s;hou'd be tran&s;acted in a &s;erious frame, <HI>after a godly &s;ort.</HI> The Lot is too awful a thing to be dally'd with. It mu&s;t not be us'd ra&s;hly, and in a light and lu&s;ory way; but with Deliberation, Seri|ou&s;ne&s;s, and Solemnity. And 'tis highly fitting this &s;acred Tran&s;action &s;hou'd be accompany'd with de|vout <HI>Prayer</HI>; at lea&s;t Ejaculatory, and in &s;uch Ca&s;es of Importance as that before us, with more &s;olemn Sup|plications. At the Divi&s;ion of the Land among the Children of I&s;rael, it's ob&s;erv'd, <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> ca&s;t Lots for them in <HI>Shiloh, before the Lord</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Jo&s;h. 18.10.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>And now if the Lot be thus regulated, the Succe&s;s may (I think) in Faith be committed to Divine Providence: And the Event may well be look'd up|on as an inconte&s;tible Di&s;covery of the Mind of CHRIST; <HI>&s;hewing</HI> hereby <HI>whether of the&s;e He hath cho|&s;en.</HI> I cou'd never yet &s;ee why in &s;uch a Ca&s;e we mayn't now-a-days, as they did in old time, expect the &s;pecial Interpo&s;ition of Heaven, to <HI>give a perfect Lot</HI>: As King <HI>Saul</HI> pray'd to the LORD GOD of I&s;rael, in the Ca&s;e depending between Him and his Son on one &s;ide, and the People on the other<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Sam. 14.41.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Indeed the Religious Lot is grown much out of Cu&s;tom; though the Civil be retain'd and in fre|quent U&s;e: yet the Divi&s;ory Lot, more than the
<PB N="34" REF="002871_0036_0FE67EDCA0097638">
Elective. But why the Lot is &s;o di&s;us'd in matters &s;pi|ritual and eccle&s;ia&s;tical, I can at pre&s;ent think of no better or truer Rea&s;on than the common Abu&s;es and Profanations of it in other ca&s;es. It is generally own'd, The Lot may lawfully be us'd about <HI>civil</HI> Concerns, where weighty Con&s;equences are in pro&s;pect, and where unhappy Differences can't well be prevented or i&s;&s;u'd any other way. Yet even here, what&s;oever is more than this, <HI>comes of Evil.</HI> The Lot is a virtu|al Calling upon GOD the LORD, to direct and de|termine us: And therefore to employ this religious Rite, in ca&s;es that are plain and clear, beyond all rational Di&s;pute, or in frivolous, much more in &s;portive Matters, is by Divines judg'd unlawful, as making too bold with Providence. And the cu&s;to|mary unhallow'd u&s;e of it in trivial Plays and Pas|times (with the too un&s;erious, and perhaps often un|nece&s;&s;ary Application of it in many Affairs of Life) appears to me the mo&s;t obvious Rea&s;on why it is fallen into Di&s;u&s;e in &s;acred Things. 'Tis owing to the Subtilty and Influence of an Helli&s;h Tempter, that the Lot is &s;o de&s;ecrated and perverted, in a &s;en|&s;ual &s;portful World. As one ob&s;erves; <Q>GOD hath his Ordinances: the Devil has his. GOD hath Sacraments for his People: the Devil has his. Is the <HI>Oath</HI> GOD's Ordinance? In Affront to this, the Devil &s;et up profane Swearing, to le&s;|&s;en the Authority and Veneration of a &s;acred Oath. So is the <HI>Lot</HI> GOD's Ordinance? Herein al&s;o the Enemy &s;ows his Tares: and to affront GOD in this Ordinance of his, he has his gaming and &s;portive Lotteries. That there may be no Religion in the u&s;e of Lots [and that the Lot mayn't be apply'd to the Service of Religion] the Devil has turn'd them all into Play</Q> and Di|ver&s;ion, or a method of Gain and Profit, or into Su|per&s;tition, Bible-Lottery (as it is call'd) and Sorcery
<PB N="35" REF="002871_0037_0FE67EDE0D0F9508">
or Divination. However, the frequent <HI>Abu&s;e</HI> and Mi&s;application of a thing, capable of being directed to &s;o excellent purpo&s;es, as the Lot is, doth not at all forbid the <HI>regular</HI> Improvement of it: And I can't &s;ee why it mayn't be as &s;afely and profitably em|ploy'd in &s;acred Ca&s;es (where it &s;eems indeed the mo&s;t proper and needful) now as ever. Nor can I &s;ee why the <HI>Lot</HI> &s;hou'd be laid a&s;ide, on the Account of vulgar Abu&s;es, any more than the <HI>Oath</HI>; which though as much pro&s;tituted and as often violated, is notwith&s;tanding made u&s;e of &s;till, without any Scruple, and with good Succe&s;s, as <HI>an End of Strife.</HI></P>
<P>You may ob&s;erve, I go very much on rational Grounds; and build not upon Scripture only: Tho' if this directs to a Lot, in any Ca&s;e, I think it is &s;ufficient Authority, were there no &s;uch evident Grounds in Rea&s;on for it. But I have enlarg'd here, on a too uncultivated Subject, much further than was at fir&s;t intended. I &s;hut up this head with that free Addre&s;s of <HI>Elihu</HI> to his worthy Fathers, the three Friends of <HI>Job</HI>; &mdash; <HI>Hear, O ye wi&s;e Men, and give Ear, ye that have Knowledge. For the Ear trieth Words, as the Mouth ta&s;teth Meat. Let us chu&s;e to us Judgment: let us know among our &s;elves what is good.</HI></P>
<P>I ha&s;ten now to the la&s;t thing under the Doctrine, which is &mdash;</P>
<P N="3">III. To &s;ay <HI>Why</HI> it ought to be the <HI>Care</HI> and <HI>De|&s;ire</HI> of a People, in the Ca&s;e before us, that CHRIST wou'd <HI>&s;hew</HI> whom He hath cho&s;en.</P>
<P>And here I &s;hall only hint,</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, It's but <HI>fit</HI> and <HI>rea&s;onable,</HI> that He &s;hou'd have the Chu&s;ing of his own Servants; and is <HI>de&s;irable</HI> that Such &s;hou'd be put into the Mini&s;try, whom <HI>he approves,</HI> and will own and ble&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="002871_0038_0FE67EDE2F5C92A0">He is the Fountain of all Power: and may lodge it in who&s;e hands he plea&s;eth. He has in&s;tituted the &s;everal Offices in the Church: And 'tis his Pro|vince, as Head and Lord, to fill them with his Ser|vants; whom, and in what way he plea&s;eth.</P>
<P><Q>As the <HI>Ordinances</HI> mu&s;t be only &s;uch as are of <HI>his</HI> In&s;titution: So the <HI>Di&s;pen&s;ers</HI> of them mu&s;t be &s;uch as are of his De&s;ignation; el&s;e they can't expect his Pre&s;ence to be with them. The LORD once complain'd of &s;ome Prophets, That <HI>they ran,</HI> and <HI>He did not &s;end them:</HI> Of whom He declares (which is threatning enough) That therefore <HI>they &s;hould not profit the People at all,</HI> Jer. 23.21, 32.</Q> It is a dreadful thing to &s;it under the Preaching and Admini&s;trations of a Man, whom we can't &s;ee CHRIST bearing Te&s;timony to, by a &s;pecial Ble&s;&s;ing on his Labours, or any vi&s;ible Tokens of his &s;piritual Pre|&s;ence with him.</P>
<P>Hence it's a very rea&s;onable Care, when a People are concern'd and de&s;irous, that CHRIST wou'd &s;hew whom He has cho&s;en. It's fit his Will &s;hou'd be done, his Coun&s;el take place; and to be de&s;ir'd that his good Plea&s;ure may be known.</P>
<P>Again, Con&s;ider, CHRIST is infinitely <HI>Wi&s;e,</HI> and a|ble to make the <HI>be&s;t</HI> Choice for a People. We may imagine him looking upon them, and &s;aying (as in <HI>Jer.</HI> 49.19.) <HI>Who is a cho&s;en Man that I may ap|point over</HI> them? <HI>For who is like Me?</HI> &mdash; Who's like Me, for chu&s;ing the fitte&s;t In&s;truments, and &s;piriting them for their Work? &mdash; We may allude to <HI>Rev.</HI> 17.14. <HI>He is LORD of Lords; and they that are with Him, are called, and cho&s;en, and faithful.</HI> As He will accept none but &s;uch as are of his own Ap|pointment: So He perfectly foreknows whom He will own and ble&s;s. <HI>Job.</HI> 13.18. <HI>I know whom I have cho&s;en.</HI> Hence He &s;aid to <HI>Ananias</HI> concerning <HI>Saul,</HI> again&s;t whom that Di&s;ciple had entertained very

great (and once ju&s;t) Prejudices, as you read, <HI>Acts</HI> 9.13 &amp;c. <HI>Ananias</HI> objected, <HI>Lord, I have heard by many of this Man, how much Evil he hath done</HI> &amp;c. <HI>But the Lord &s;aid unto him, Go thy way; for he is a cho&s;en Ve&s;&s;el unto me to bear my Name before the</HI> Gen|tiles. We may be apt to throw a&s;ide this or t'other, as a <HI>de&s;pi&s;ed Lamp</HI>; when to the LORD he may be a <HI>Cho&s;en Ve&s;&s;el.</HI> We &s;hou'd gladly therefore refer it to his Wi&s;dom, to determine for us; and be &s;ollici|tous that he wou'd &s;hew whom He has cho&s;en. Thus we &s;hall put Honour on his wi&s;e and &s;overeign Providence.</P>
<P>In a word, Thus we &s;hall con&s;ult <HI>our own Intere&s;t and Peace.</HI> For a People will be more di&s;pos'd to re|ceive Such in the Lord with all gladne&s;s, and hold them in Reputation, whom they &s;ee CHRIST &s;hewing He hath cho&s;en. Whatever Objections <HI>Ananias</HI> had again&s;t <HI>Saul</HI>; yet when he heard tho&s;e Words, <HI>He is a cho&s;en Ve&s;&s;el unto me,</HI> the good Man in&s;tantly embrac'd him as a <HI>Brother,</HI> with great Affection. And this will have a natural and (by the Divine Ble&s;&s;ing) a powerful Tendency to a People's profit|ing by the Mini&s;try of &s;uch an one. &mdash; And then this will afford no &s;mall Con&s;olation to the People of GOD, as it is to them an evident Token of Salvation; a happy &s;ign of the Lord's Pre&s;ence with them; that his Spirit remains among them, and that his King|dom &s;hall be &s;till upheld in the mid&s;t of them. <HI>Ezek.</HI> 34.29, 30. <HI>I will rai&s;e up for them a Plant of Renown. Thus &s;hall they know, that I the</HI> LORD <HI>their GOD am with them; and that they, even the hou&s;e of</HI> I&s;rael, <HI>are my People, &s;aith the</HI> LORD <HI>GOD.</HI></P>
<P>For the&s;e and other Rea&s;ons, it &s;hou'd be the Care and Concern of a People, who have before them the Choice of a Mini&s;ter; That the LORD wou'd <HI>&s;hew whom He hath cho&s;en,</HI> whom he hath appointed, and will approve. This was the Sollicitude and De|&s;ire

<P><PB N="39" REF="002871_0041_0FE67EE68CBA1E20">So in our Text, <HI>They prayed and &s;aid</HI> &mdash;</P>
<P>Prayer is a devout offering up of our regular De&s;ires to the Throne of Grace. It &s;hou'd not only be our <HI>Hearts De&s;ire,</HI> but our <HI>Prayer</HI> al&s;o, That CHRIST wou'd &s;hew us whom He hath cho&s;en.</P>
<P>Here we might ob&s;erve,</P>
<P>The LORD JESUS CHRIST (the Son of GOD) is together with the FATHER and HOLY GHOST, the pro|per Object of religious Wor&s;hip. He has all tho&s;e Divine Perfections, and &s;u&s;tains all tho&s;e Divine Re|lations, Titles and Characters, which proclaim him the worthy Object of our Faith, Love, Prayer and Prai&s;e, in their mo&s;t exalted Sen&s;e, and highe&s;t Ex|erci&s;es. And to Him &s;hould our Prayers &s;ometimes be <HI>immediately</HI> directed; if we wou'd honour the SON, even as we honour the FATHER. The Protomartyr <HI>Stephen</HI> in his dying moments pray'd to <HI>the Lord JESUS.</HI> And in our Text, we have the Apo&s;tles and an A&s;&s;embly of the fir&s;t Di&s;ciples, uniting their &s;olemn Supplications to Him. &mdash; The Title, LORD, is the &s;pecial Title of CHRIST; his con&s;tant Style, throughout the New Te&s;tament. And it was cu&s;toma|ry among the primitive Chri&s;tians to make their reli|gious Addre&s;&s;es unto Him; in&s;omuch that they were characteris'd, and di&s;tingui&s;h'd from <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Hea|then,</HI> by their <HI>Calling upon the Name of the</HI> LORD JESUS<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Act. 9.14. Rom. 10.12. 1 Cor. 1.2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome &s;pecial Ca&s;es, wherein it &s;eems pe|culiarly proper and congruous, di&s;tinctly to invocate the LORD JESUS CHRIST. Thus, particularly in the Admini&s;tration of the LORD's <HI>Supper,</HI> which is of his In&s;titution, and bears his Name, and the primary De|&s;ign whereof is to do honour to his Memory, by a grateful Celebration of his redeeming Love. So in the <HI>Election</HI> (as well as in the <HI>Ordination</HI>) of Per|&s;ons,
<PB N="40" REF="002871_0042_0FE67EE6AEE1A5E0">
to &s;erve CHRIST in the Mini&s;try, it &s;eems equal|ly proper, that the Name of the LORD JESUS &s;hou'd be expre&s;ly and immediately call'd upon.</P>
<P>Now, if you ask <HI>What</HI> is to be reque&s;ted of Him, in &s;uch a Ca&s;e; I an&s;wer in general, as in our Text, <HI>That He would &s;hew whom He hath cho&s;en:</HI> &mdash; (Imply|ing) That he wou'd chu&s;e for us in great Mercy, and that he wou'd di&s;cover his Mind and Will to us, in tho&s;e ways in which it may be expected: That he wou'd pre&s;ide and govern in the Choice propos'd by us; influence our Views and Re&s;olutions, and cau&s;e a Coincidence of all things to the accompli&s;h|ment of his own Coun&s;el), and bringing the Affair to a happy Re&s;ult: That all matters of Controver&s;y be|tween Him and us may be remov'd, and no Ob&s;truc|tions lie in the way to hinder a Ble&s;&s;ing from being be&s;tow'd upon us: That when the Lot is ca&s;t into the Lap, there may be a gracious Di&s;po&s;al thereof, by his Power and Wi&s;dom; that the Lot may fall upon One, who &s;hall be a Pa&s;tor <HI>according to his Heart</HI>; One whom He hath <HI>called by his Grace,</HI> and will delight to ble&s;s and pro&s;per. &mdash; This may be the Tenour and Scope of our Prayers on &s;uch an Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>And if you ask <HI>Why</HI> we &s;hou'd thus employ Pray|er in the Ca&s;e? I an&s;wer,</P>
<P N="1">1. Our LORD him&s;elf has <HI>directed</HI> us to this Method. Be&s;ides that Prayer is the appointed way for obtain|ing all the Benefits we de&s;ire. It's particularly pre|&s;crib'd in the Ca&s;e before us; 'Tis imply'd in that direction to the Di&s;ciples, <HI>Mat.</HI> 9.38. <HI>Pray ye the Lord of the Harve&s;t, that He will &s;end forth Labourers into his Harve&s;t.</HI> &mdash; It is ob&s;ervable, the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> frequently and pathetically de&s;ir'd the Prayers of this and the other Church whom he purpos'd to vi&s;it;

As the bad Actions of Men are related in Scripture-Story, for our Admonition and Warning: So the good and laudable Actions of the Saints are &s;tory'd, not only for their Commendation, but for our Imita|tion and Learning. Hence we are exhorted to be <HI>Followers of them who through faith and patience inhe|rit the Promi&s;es.</HI> Heb. 6.12.</P>

Such Gifts CHRIST has receiv'd, to be be&s;tow'd on his Church and People, as the vi&s;ible Signs and Means of his gracious Pre&s;ence in the mid&s;t of them. This affords one advantageous Plea.

<P>Hence, it will be our Wi&s;dom to put the Affair under our LORD's Conduct; and not lean to our own Under&s;tandings, nor tru&s;t in our own Hearts. <HI>Commit thy Works to the Lord: So &s;hall thy thoughts be e&s;tabli&s;hed.</HI> Make thy Prayer unto Him, and He will hear thee: Thou &s;halt al&s;o decree a thing, and it &s;hall be e&s;tabli&s;h'd unto thee; and the <HI>light &s;hall &s;hine upon thy ways.</HI></P>

<P N="1">I. A due con&s;ideration of CHRIST as the LORD, may be of very profitable Con&s;equence, in the ma|nagement of the Affair before us.</P>
<P>To give a few hints here di&s;tinctly.</P>
<P N="1">1. This will teach us, from a <HI>Reverence to the Office</HI> of the Mini&s;try, as the In&s;titution of CHRIST our Glo|rious LORD, to treat the Affair of chu&s;ing and calling a Per&s;on to that Office, with a becoming <HI>Seriou&s;ne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Solemnity.</HI></P>

<P N="2">2. The &s;erious Con&s;ideration of CHRIST as LORD, will help to <HI>regulate</HI> our <HI>Aims,</HI> and <HI>guide</HI> our <HI>Choice.</HI></P>

<P>It will lead us to con&s;ult the Scriptures for Direc|tion, and to take Coun&s;el from them, in managing this Affair of CHRIST's Kingdom.

The Eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding the Evil and the Good<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Pro. 15.2, 11.</NOTE>. Hell and De&s;truction are before the Lord: how much more then the Hearts of the Chil|dren of Men? Verily to his piercing Eye every Bo&s;om is tran&s;parent, and all things there appear in the mo&s;t open Light to Him, which are beyond the Reach of all human Di&s;covery. And this Thought is capable of an application to very good Purpo&s;es, both by way of Direction and Incentive; as in the common Con|cerns of the Chri&s;tian Life, &s;o particularly in the extraordinary Affair before us.</P>
<P>To illu&s;trate this, let me &s;ugge&s;t a few particulars.</P>
<P>For In&s;tance,</P>
<P N="1">I. The Con&s;ideration of CHRIST's knowing the Hearts of all Men, as in our Text apply'd to the pre&s;ent Affair, may be u&s;eful to <HI>direct</HI> us in our Choice, what to <HI>aim at,</HI> and what regards to be influenced by.</P>
<P>It was a Reproof the Apo&s;tle gave to &s;ome in the Church of <HI>Corinth,</HI> who indulg'd &s;uch a &s;pirit of E|mulation about their Teachers (2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10.7.) <HI>Do ye look on things after the outward appearance?</HI> This is a common Rule of judging: but a fal&s;e Rule, at lea&s;t a very imperfect and in&s;ufficient One. It &s;hou'd

&s;eem, that &s;ome boa&s;ted mighty things of them&s;elves, and affected to make a fair Shew in the fle&s;h, but they boa&s;ted of things without mea&s;ure, and by fair Speeches deceived the Hearts of the Simple. We often &s;uffer our Views only to glide upon the Super|ficies of Men and Things, and take no pains to enter into their Realities and true Characters. We are either ea&s;ily impos'd upon by deceiving Appearances, and draw up a ha&s;ty Judgment. Or el&s;e we are led away with Mi&s;takes about the Nature of Things, and con&s;ider not where true Excellency lies. Agreeably, things of comparatively le&s;s Significancy, often have the preference with us: the things of the Body, to the things of the Soul: So again the things of the Mind, to the things of the Heart; intellectual Ac|compli&s;hments, to &s;piritual Graces and moral Virtues: Which is the mo&s;t perver&s;e Judgment in the World. And to act under the Influence of &s;uch a fal&s;e View of things in the Affair before us, mu&s;t needs be of dangerous Tendency.</P>
<P>But here our <HI>Text</HI> may &s;et us right; which intimates that the Di&s;ciples looked chiefly at the <HI>Heart,</HI> in the Choice before them; and that CHRIST looketh at the Hearts of Men, in chu&s;ing Pa&s;tors for his Church. We are apt to look chiefly at the Head, and external Appear|ance, an happy Utterance, bright Gifts, the Powers of Rea&s;on, the Beauties of Language, or the like: but verily the Lord looketh at the Heart. The Lord weigheth the Spirits; and he e&s;timates us by our inner Man. To be renew'd in the &s;pirit of our Minds, after the Image of Him that created us in Righteou&s;ne&s;s and true Holine&s;s, this is our high|e&s;t Glory; and is the mo&s;t exalted Character of a Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel: Who&s;e Adorning, let it not be that outward Adorning of Eloquence, Beauty, or worldly Pomp: but let it be the hidden Man of the Heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the Or|nament

<P>His Knowledge of the Hearts of Men argues his Ability to prepare and di&s;po&s;e Men's Hearts aright: And if he does not find them at pre&s;ent fit for his purpo&s;e (as in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Saul,</HI> who from a Bla&s;phemer and Per&s;ecutor, was chang'd into a Preacher and Apo&s;tle of JESUS CHRIST) he has power to <HI>enable them</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. 1.12.</NOTE>, to furni&s;h and &s;pirit them to their Work.

<P>In a word, Con&s;ider, He who &s;earcheth the Reins, can govern <HI>your</HI> Hearts, as he plea&s;eth, and can unite you in your Judgments and Inclinations, <HI>The hand of GOD may be to give you one Heart.</HI> So that you &s;hall be perfectly joined together in the &s;ame Mind, and with one Mouth glorify GOD, in the unanimous Choice of &s;ome meet and worthy Per&s;on.

<P>This Reflection duly entertained, will be a <HI>Motive</HI> and <HI>Help</HI> to Sincerity: will tend to rectify our Aims; to make us keep our Hearts with all Diligence, and &s;tudy to &s;hew our &s;elves approved unto Him, who

<P>It will promote Sincerity in our <HI>De&s;ires</HI> and <HI>Prayers,</HI> that CHRIST wou'd &s;hew us whom He hath cho&s;en: and therefore will make us beware that no Idol of Jealou&s;y have harbour in our Bo&s;oms; which will provoke the Lord to pa&s;s that Doom upon us, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 14. <HI>The&s;e Men have &s;et up their Idols in their Heart;&mdash;&s;hould I at all be inquired of by them?</HI> &mdash; Surely <HI>I the LORD will an&s;wer them by my &s;elf, and will &s;et my Face again&s;t them.</HI> &mdash; The Scripture has put tho&s;e &s;olemn Words of prayer into our Mouths, 1 Kin. 8.39. <HI>Then hear thou in Heaven thy Dwelling place, and give to every one according to his Ways, who&s;e Heart Thou knowe&s;t.</HI> But how &s;hall we dare to pray in &s;uch awful Language, without a mo&s;t &s;ollicitous Care to avoid Hypocri&s;y; and to &s;eek the Lord with our whole De&s;ire, lifting up holy Hands, and drawing nigh to Him with a true Heart: Who&s;e penetrating Eye has an immediate Acce&s;s to the Mind, and a di&s;tict Pro&s;pect of all the &s;e|cret Motions in every Brea&s;t, through all po&s;&s;ible Masks and Di&s;gui&s;es!</P>

<P>And it will mini&s;ter to our Con&s;olation under any Di&s;appointment we may meet with, if we can appeal to the Searcher of Hearts, as witne&s;s to our Sincerity. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 142.2. <HI>When my &s;pirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewe&s;t my Path.</HI> Yea, if the Lot of any be involuntarily ca&s;t under an unfaithful Mini&s;try, and they have born due Te&s;timony again&s;t the &s;ame, it may be con&s;olatory to them to think that CHRIST <HI>knows their Works and their Patience, and how they can|not bear them which are evil, and have tried them which &s;ay they are Apo&s;tles and are not.</HI> (See <HI>Rev.</HI> 2.2.)</P>
<P>So under invidious Characters, hard Speeches and Reproaches of Men, who may tax us with Partiality, carnal Policy, &s;ecret Intreagues and fraudulent Prac|tices, or with &s;ini&s;ter Re&s;pects, and unju&s;t Prejudices, or the like; here a View to the future Account, and the Thought of CHRIST's all-&s;eeing Eye, may &s;up|port and comfort us, if we are really con&s;cious to our Integrity and Innocence. We may appeal to Hea|ven, and &s;ay as the Prophet (<HI>Jer.</HI> 20.12.) <HI>O Lord of Ho&s;ts, that trie&s;t the Righteous, and &s;ee&s;t the Reins and Heart, &mdash; unto Thee have I opened my Cau&s;e.</HI> We may humbly hope that <HI>GOD which knoweth the Hearts, will bear us Witne&s;s.</HI> (<HI>Acts</HI> 15.8.) And may learn to de&s;pi&s;e the uncharitable Cen&s;ures of Men, when they &s;peak Evil of the things which they know not. Hence that of the Apo&s;tle, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4. &mdash; <HI>It is required in Stewards, that a Man be found faithful. But with me it is a</HI> VERY SMALL <HI>thing that I &s;hould be judged of you, or of Man's Judgment. But he that judgeth is the Lord. Therefore judge nothing before the Time, until the Lord come, who will bring to Light the hidden things of Darkne&s;s, and will make manife&s;t

the Coun&s;els of the Heart: And then &s;hall every man have Prai&s;e of GOD</HI>; every Man who has walked in his Uprightne&s;s.</P>
<P>In a word, The thought of CHRIST's In&s;pection of us, and our Accountablene&s;s to Him, will tend to prevent all unchri&s;tian Heats and Animo&s;ities; to allay and hu&s;h Men's Pa&s;&s;ions, &s;o apt to be unquiet and impetuous, when cro&s;s'd in their particular Views. It will teach us all to watch again&s;t uncharitable Thoughts, and <HI>evil Surmi&s;ings,</HI> contrary to the Love which &s;hou'd be among Brethren: and will teach us to take heed to our Ways, that we offend not with our Tongues: will teach us to forbear all Clamour, and Wrath, and Evil-&s;peaking, Impatience, unrea&s;o|nable Humour, and Self-willedne&s;s: And on the contrary will teach us to deny our &s;elves, to be kind|ly affectioned one to another with brotherly Love, in honour preferring one another, being &s;wift to hear, &s;low to &s;peak: Not to mind high things, but to con|de&s;cend unto Men of low E&s;tate, and every one plea&s;e his Neighbour for his Good, to Edification: To be of a yielding Temper, <HI>&s;tudying</HI> to be quiet; and <HI>if it be po&s;&s;ible,</HI> as much as lieth in us, endea|vouring to live peaceably. To this End is that Ex|hortation, <HI>Col.</HI> 4.6. <HI>Let your Speech be alway with grace, &s;ea&s;oned with Salt, that ye may know how ye ought to an&s;wer every Man.</HI> And hence tho&s;e Intreaties, <HI>Phil.</HI> 4.1, 2, 5. <HI>Therefore my Brethren, dearly beloved, and longed for, my Joy and Crown, &s;o &s;tand fa&s;t my dearly beloved. I be&s;eech</HI> Euodias, <HI>and be&s;eech</HI> Syntiche, <HI>that they be of the &s;ame Mind in the LORD. &mdash; Let your Moderation be known to all Men.</HI> THE LORD IS AT HAND. And agreeable are tho&s;e Coun&s;els of the Apo&s;tle <HI>James</HI>: My Brethren have not the Faith of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, the LORD of Glory, with Re&s;pect of Per&s;ons. &mdash; So &s;peak ye, and &s;o do, <HI>as they that &s;hall be judged</HI> by the Law of Liberty. &mdash; My Brethren <HI>be

not many Ma&s;ters</HI>; knowing that ye &s;hall receive the greater Condemnation. &mdash; Do ye think that the Scrip|ture &s;aith in vain. <HI>The Spirit that dwelleth in us lu&s;teth to Envy?</HI> But &s;ubmit your &s;elves to GOD: Re&s;i&s;t the Devil; and grudge not one again&s;t another, Bre|thren, le&s;t ye be condemned: <HI>Behold, the Judge &s;tand|eth before the Door.</HI></P>
<P>I conclude with tho&s;e Apo&s;tical Benedictions and Apologies, in <HI>Rom.</HI> 15.</P>
<P>Now the GOD of Patience and Con&s;olation grant that you be <HI>like-minded</HI> one towards another, accord|ing to CHRIST JESUS. That ye may with <HI>one Mind</HI> and <HI>one Mouth</HI> glorify GOD. &mdash; The GOD of Hope fill you with all Joy and Peace in believing, that ye may abound in Hope through the power of the HOLY GHOST. And I my &s;elf am per&s;uaded of you, my Bre|thren, that ye are full of Goodne&s;s, filled with all Knowledge, able al&s;o to admoni&s;h one another. Ne|verthele&s;s, Brethren, I have written the more boldly unto you, in &s;ome &s;ort, as putting you in Mind; be|cau&s;e of the Grace that is given me of GOD, that I &s;hould be the Mini&s;ter of JESUS CHRIST <HI>unto you.</HI> Now therefore I be&s;eech you, Brethren, for the LORD JESUS CHRIST's &s;ake, &amp; for the Love of the Spirit, that ye &s;trive together with me in Prayers to GOD for me, that I may with you be refre&s;hed. And now the GOD of Peace be with you all. Amen.</P>
