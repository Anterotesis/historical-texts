<P><HI>THE</HI> following Charges and Proofs re&s;pecting the Conduct of <HI>PETER LANDAIS,</HI> when he commanded the Frigate Alliance while joined with the Squadron that was, by his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty &s;upported in Europe in the late war, under the Flag and Commi&s;&s;ion of the United States, were officially tran&s;mitted to this country (&s;oon after the date) in order to be laid before the Sovereignty. But as he <HI>(PETER LANDAIS)</HI> was broke at Bo&s;ton, and ren|dered incapable of public &s;ervice by a Court Martial, for matters totally different, and of a <HI>&s;ub&s;equent date,</HI> it is to be pre&s;umed that the Beard of Admiralty had not, at that time, received the Proofs now in que&s;tion. They were lodged for &s;afety, by the owner, in the Office of Foreign Affairs, where they &s;till remain, in original. They would have been buried in oblivion, if he <HI>(PETER LANDAIS)</HI> had not publi&s;hed in the New-York papers of the <HI>31</HI>&s;t October, <HI>1787,</HI> that their exi&s;tence was <HI>"AN UNTRUTH."</HI> They are now made public, that the world may judge re&s;pecting his Character, and what Credit may be given to his a&s;&s;ertions.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>(COPY.)</HEAD>
<P>WE, the Officers, &amp;c. of the Ameri|can &s;quadron now at the Texel, this 30th day of October, 1779, do atte&s;t and declare, upon our words of honor, as gentlemen, that all the following Articles, which we &s;ub&s;cribe, re&s;pecting the con|duct of PETER LANDAIS, Captain of the frigate Alliance, are really and truly mat|ters of fact. In Witne&s;s whereof, we hereunto &s;ign our names and qualities; and will, at any time hereafter, be ready to prove the &s;ame upon oath, if required.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Captain of the Alliance did not take the &s;teps in his power, to prevent his &s;hip from getting foul of the Bon Homme Richard, in the Bay of Bi&s;cay; for, in|&s;tead of putting his helm a-weather and bearing up, to make way for his Com|manding Officer (which was his duty), he left the deck to load his pi&s;tols.</P>
<P N="2">2. When in chace of a &s;hip (&s;uppo&s;ed an Engli&s;h Ea&s;t-Indiaman), on the &mdash; day of Augu&s;t, 1779, Captain Landais did not do his utmo&s;t to overtake that &s;hip, which he might ea&s;ily have done before night; but put his helm a-weather, and bore away &s;everal times in the day, after the Alliance had gained the wake of the chace, and was overtaking her very fa&s;t.</P>
<P N="3">3. Captain Landais behaved with di&s;|re&s;pect and impertinence towards the Commander in Chief of the &s;quadron, on frequent occa&s;ions.</P>
<P N="4">4. He di&s;obeyed his &s;ignals.</P>
<P N="5">5. He very &s;eldom an&s;wered any of them.</P>
<P N="6">6. He expre&s;&s;ed his fears and appre|hen&s;ions of being taken on the coa&s;t of Ireland; and in&s;i&s;ted on leaving &s;ight of it immediately, when we had crui&s;ed there only two days.</P>
<P N="7">7. His &s;eparation from the &s;quadron, the fir&s;t time, mu&s;t have happened either through ignorance or de&s;ign; becau&s;e tho' he di&s;tinctly &s;aw the &s;ignal for the cour&s;e before night, yet he altered it, fir&s;t two, and then four points of the compa&s;s be|fore morning.</P>
<P N="8">8. His &s;eparation from the &s;quadron, the &s;econd time, mu&s;t al&s;o have happened through ignorance or de&s;ign; becau&s;e, the wind being at N. W. and the other &s;hips, to <HI>his knowledge,</HI> lying to, and being a&s;tern of the Alliance, what le&s;s than &s;eparation could be the con&s;equence of his ob&s;tinacy, in ordering the weather main brace to be hauled in, and the &s;hip to be &s;teered S. W. and S. W. by S. in the trough of the &s;ea; which was done from ten at night 'till morning: and he would not then permit the &s;hip to be tacked, in order to rejoin the &s;quadron, as was propo&s;ed to him by the officers.</P>
<P N="9">9. On the morning of the 23d Sept. when the Bon Homme Richard, after be|ing off the Spurn, came in &s;ight of the Alliance and Pallas, off Flamborough Head, Captain Landais di&s;tinctly told Captain Cottineau, that if it was, as it ap|peared, a fifty-gun &s;hip, they mu&s;t run a|way; altho' he mu&s;t have been &s;ure that the Pallas, <HI>from her heavy &s;ailing,</HI> mu&s;t have fallen a &s;acrifice.</P>
<P N="10"><PB N="6" REF="020436_0004_0FAF0BDB21B95CA0">10. In the afternoon of the &s;ame day, Captain Landais paid no attention to &s;ig|nals, particularly the &s;ignal of preparation and for the line, which was made with great care, and very di&s;tinctly, on board the Bon Homme Richard.</P>
<P N="11">11. Altho' the Alliance was a long way ahead of the Bon Homme Richard, when bearing down on the Baltic fleet, yet Cap|tain Landais lay out of gun-&s;hot to wind|ward, until the Bon Homme Richard had pa&s;&s;ed by and clo&s;ely engaged the Serapis; and then, in&s;tead of coming to clo&s;e acti|on with the Counte&s;s of Scarborough, the Alliance fired at very long &s;hot.</P>
<P N="12">12. He continued to windward, and, a con&s;iderable time after the action began, fell a&s;tern and &s;poke the Pallas; leaving the Counte&s;s of Scarborough in the wake of the &s;hips engaged, and at free liberty to rake the Bon Homme Richard.</P>
<P N="13">13. After the Bon Homme Richard and Serapis were made fa&s;t along-&s;ide of each other, as in the margin, (which was not done till an hour after the engagement began) Captain Landais, <HI>out of mu&s;ket-&s;hot,</HI> raked the Bon Homme Richard with cro&s;s|bar and grape &s;hot, &amp;c. which killed a number of men, di&s;mounted &s;undry guns, put out the &s;ide-lights, and &s;ilenced all the twelve-pounders.</P>
<P N="14">14. The Alliance then ran down to|wards the Pallas and Counte&s;s of Scarbo|rough, that were, at the time, engaged at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance to leeward of the Bon Homme Richard and Serapis, and Captain Landais hovered about there out of gun-&s;hot, and without firing, 'till &s;ome time after the Counte&s;s of Scarborough had &s;truck; and then bore down, under his top-&s;ails, and &s;poke, fir&s;t the prize, and then the Pallas, a&s;king a number of que&s;ti|ons.</P>
<P N="15">15. At la&s;t Captain Landais made &s;ail, under his top-&s;ails, to work up to wind|ward, but made tacks before he (being within the range of grape &s;hot, and, <HI>at the longe&s;t,</HI> three quarters of an hour before the Serapis &s;truck) fired a &s;econd broad|&s;ide into the Bon Homme Richard's lar|board quarter, the latter part whereof was fired when the Alliance was not more than three points aba&s;t the Bon Homme Rich|ard's beam, altho' many tongues had cried from the Bon Homme Richard, that Cap|tain Landais was firing into the wrong &s;hip, and prayed him to lay the enemy along-&s;ide. Three large &s;ignal lanthorns, with proper &s;ignal wax candles in them, and well lighted, had al&s;o, previou&s;ly to his firing, been hung over the bow, quarter and wai&s;t of the Bon Homme Richard, in a horizontal line, which was the &s;ignal of reconnoi&s;ance; and the &s;hips, the one hav|ing a high poop, and being all black, the other having a low &s;tern, with yellow &s;ides&punc; were ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hable, it being full moon.</P>
<P N="16">16. The Alliance then pa&s;&s;ed at a very con&s;iderable di&s;tance along the larboard or off-&s;ide of the Bon Homme Richard, and having tacked and gained the wind, ran down again to leeward, and, in cro&s;&s;ing the Bon Homme Richard's bow, Captain Landais raked her with a third broad&s;ide, after being con&s;tantly called to from the Bon Homme Richard, not to fire, but to lay the enemy along-&s;ide.</P>
<P N="17">17. Sundry men were killed and wounded by the broad&s;ides mentioned in the two la&s;t articles.</P>
<P N="18">18. Captain Landais never pa&s;&s;ed on the off-&s;ide of the Serapis, nor could that &s;hip ever bring a gun to bear on the Alli|ance at any time during the engagement.</P>
<P N="19">19. The leaks of the Bon Homme Richard increa&s;ed much after being fired upon by the Alliance; and as the mo&s;t dan|gerous &s;hot which the Bon Homme Rich|ard received under the water, were under the larboard bow and quarter, they mu&s;t
<PB N="7" REF="020436_0005_0FAF0BDBD513C468">
have come from the Alliance, for the Sera|pis was on the other &s;ide.</P>
<P N="20">20. Several people on board the Alli|ance told Captain Landais, at different times, that he fired upon the wrong &s;hip; others refu&s;ed to fire.</P>
<P N="21">21. The Alliance only fired three broad&s;ides while within gun-&s;hot of the Bon Homme Richard and Serapis.</P>
<P N="22">22. The morning after the engage|ment, Captain Landais acknowledged on board the Serapis, that he raked each time with grape-&s;hot, which he knew would &s;catter.</P>
<P N="23">23. Captain Landais has acknowledged &s;ince the action, that he would have thought it no harm if the Bon Homme Richard had &s;truck, for it would have given him an op|portunity to re-take her, and to take the Serapis.</P>
<P N="24">24. He has frequently declared that he was the only American in the Squadron, and that he was not under the orders of Captain Jones.</P>
<P N="25">25. In coming into the Texel, he de|clared that if Captain Jones &s;hould hoi&s;t a broad pendant, he would, <HI>to vex him,</HI> hoi&s;t another.</P>

<P>I THE under-&s;igned Philip Ricot, Captain of a ve&s;&s;el in the &s;ervice of the United States of America, and Command|er of the Tender Vengeance, in confor|mity to the reque&s;t of Commodore Paul Jones, my Commander, do communicate to him, and affirm to the different circum|&s;tances hereafter declared; in which M. Landais, Captain of the frigate Alliance, has, in this cruize, appeared to have devi|ated from that &s;ubordination which the &s;er|vice requires.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erved, that, on the 31&s;t of Augu&s;t, at half pa&s;t four in the afternoon, a &s;ignal was made him by the Commodore to chace a &s;ail in &s;ight, which M. Landais did not obey.</P>
<P>The next day, Sept. 1&s;t, the Commo|dore made him a &s;ignal to come under his &s;tern, that he might &s;peak with him: this M. Landais did not do.</P>
<P>The 5th of Sept. the Captains of the divi&s;ion being on board the Commodore, according to his orders, M. Landais was the only one who refu&s;ed to go; and al|tho' Me&s;&s;rs. de Chamillard and Cottineau went on board the Alliance, to per&s;uade him to it, he per&s;i&s;ted in his refu&s;al.</P>
<P>That, in the night of the 23d and 24th of &s;aid month, during the engagement be|tween the Bon Homme Richard and the Serapis, the Alliance remained within can|non-&s;hot of the enemy's &s;hip, from about half after eight till ten o'clock, without my having &s;een her fire. I &s;hall add, that, Oct. 1&s;t, at eight at night, I received or|ders from the Commodore to go and tell M. Landais, who was to windward, to take po&s;t a-&s;tern of him; to which I re|ceived

<P>THESE are to certify, that I, Henry Lunt, Second Lieut. of the American &s;hip of war, the late Bon Homme Richard, but now of the Serapis, commanded by the Honorable John Paul Jones, having, on the 23d day of Sept, 1779, been ordered in a pilot-boat, with a party of men, after a brig; but, &s;ome time after I &s;et out from along-&s;ide, a &s;ignal was made for me to return back to the Bon Homme Richard, &s;he being then in chace of two Briti&s;h &s;hips of war, the Serapis and Counte&s;s of Scar|borough; and before I could get on board the Bon Homme Richard, &s;he commenced engagement with the Briti&s;h &s;hip of war Serapis. It being night, I thought it not prudent to go along-&s;ide in the time of ac|tion. Being in this boat near, I had an opportunity of &s;eeing &s;ome part of the Alliance's behaviour, above three quarters of an hour after the action began with the Richard and Serapis. The Alliance was to windward of them, and appeared to be lying to, about one mile di&s;tance. At the &s;ame time, the Pallas was engaging the Counte&s;s of Scarborough to leeward of the Alliance, out of my &s;ight. Pre&s;ently, af|ter the Pallas and Counte&s;s of Scarborough had cea&s;ed firing, the Alliance bore down for them, and di&s;appeared out of my &s;ight. What &s;he did there, I can't tell; but &s;he was gone, as near as I can judge, one hour and three-quarters, and then appeared to me to be going up to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Bon Homme Richard, but was half-an-hour from that time before &s;he fired; and, after &s;he got up to the Richard and Serapis, &s;he fired, and then &s;tood off from them to the Ea&s;t|ward &s;ome ways and, as near as I can judge, was gone better than half an hour, then returned back to the Richard and Se|rapis, and fired again.</P>

the Alliance begin the engagement, either with the Serapis or the Counte&s;s of Scar|borough; having remarked, ju&s;t before I went to the main-top (where I command|ed a detachment during the action), that &s;he appeared to me to be very near them. M. Landais had pre&s;&s;ed &s;ail, during the whole afternoon, without orders. M. Cottineau hailed us, and a&s;ked what &s;tation he &s;hould take during the action, and com|plained to M. Jones, that M. Landais, in&s;tead of forming the rear, as it had been agreed, took the van, which was his (M. Cottineau's), from him. M. Jones, how|ever, made the &s;ignal for forming the line; and I well recollect that he cau&s;ed a ma|noeuvre to be made, in order that the Al|liance might clearly &s;ee his &s;ignal; but M. Landais, <HI>as u&s;ual,</HI> paid no attention to it; and we all thought the Alliance engaged a long time before us.</P>
<P>After taking my &s;tation in the main-top, I thought no more of the Alliance, be|cau&s;e the main-top-&s;ail hid her from me. A little while after the Serapis hailed us, and I then perceived the Serapis and the Counte&s;s of Scarborough pretty nigh each other. We immediately began the en|gagement with the Serapis, and I did not perceive the Alliance till about two hours afterwards, when I &s;aw her rake us with her whole broad&s;ide, a little to larboard of us; and, at the &s;ame time, I heard a hundred voices hailing the Alliance, and telling them, that it was on board the Bon Homme Richard that &s;he was firing; a moment afterwards &s;he pa&s;&s;ed us on our larboard &s;ide, and it was with difficulty, that I hindered the people whom I com|manded from firing on her. I hailed M. Landais as loud as I could, &s;aying to him, "I beg you will not &s;ink us." I at the &s;ame time thought that M. Landais was taking the advantage of our circum&s;tances to de&s;troy M. Jones, and thereby &s;ave him&s;elf the trouble he mu&s;t have expected for having di&s;obeyed M. Jones, in cha&s;ing without orders, and in edging off, to &s;hape a contrary cour&s;e, when the &s;ignal was made to cha&s;e; and on &s;everal other occa|&s;ions, &s;uch as refu&s;ing to come on board the Bon Homme Richard to con&s;ult on the nece&s;&s;ary operations, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Alliance then came athwart our bow, and began afre&s;h to cannonade us ve|ry &s;martly; I then had not the lea&s;t doubt of his intention to &s;ink us, and &s;hould have fired on the Alliance, in preference to the Serapis, but that the main-top-&s;ail and o|ther &s;ails concealed her from us. At the in&s;tant when they cried that the Serapis had &s;truck, I came down, and was inform|ed that the Alliance had killed us a number of people, and, among&s;t others, an Offi|cer who was on the foreca&s;tle. In my o|pinion, there was not a &s;oul on board the Bon Homme Richard, who did not believe that M. Landais knew us before he fired, as we were higher out of water than the Se|rapis; that it was moon-light, and that we had made the &s;ignal by which we mu&s;t have been known, during the action.</P>
<P>The Fir&s;t Lieutenant of the Counte&s;s of Scarborough told me, &s;ome days &s;ince, that he had remarked, during the action with the Pallas, that the Alliance was for &s;ome time athwart and to windward of them; that as &s;oon as the Scarborough had &s;truck, the Alliance came and hailed them, and a&s;ked them, what ve&s;&s;el that was, which was engaged? He was an&s;wered, that it was the Serapis. He a&s;ked her force, but they would not tell him; he then tacked and &s;haped his cour&s;e, under his top-&s;ails <HI>only,</HI> to join us.</P>

<P>WHEREAS &s;ince the campaign of 1779, there have been various and partial reports &s;ecretly &s;pread again&s;t the private and &s;ocial character of Commodore Paul Jones, formerly commanding the &s;quadron of the Bon Homme Richard; and as, among other hear&s;ays and groundle&s;s &s;to|ries, I have &s;ometimes heard that the a|bove-mentioned Officer had formally giv|en the Lie to M. Landais, formerly Cap|tain of the Alliance, relating to the lo&s;s of a boat in &s;ight of the coa&s;t of Ireland:&mdash; Therefore, I declare and affirm, that the afore&s;aid Commodore did not &s;ay to M. Landais, "You Lie," but no more than the&s;e very words, "It is an untruth;" which M. Landais was plea&s;ed to interpret as a <HI>formal giving the Lie;</HI> who was never able to overcome his peevi&s;h, ob&s;tinate, turbulent and ungovernable temper, which he con&s;tantly &s;hewed during the whole of the campaign. Moreover, I certify, that Commodore Paul Jones, far from com|manding with haughtine&s;s or brutality, as certain per&s;ons have endeavored to circu|late, was always (tho' very &s;trict and &s;harp in the &s;ervice) affable, genteel, and very indulgent, not only towards his Officers, but likewi&s;e towards the &s;ailors and &s;oldi|ers, whom he ever treated with humanity. &mdash;As I was a witne&s;s to the above-menti|oned quarrel, I mu&s;t in con&s;cience confe&s;s, that M. Landais gave, at the time, great cau&s;e for it, by the arrogant manner which he a&s;&s;umed towards his Commander, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">n an&s;wer to the peaceable, good and fair <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ea&s;ons, to which he would never yield; <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">o far to the contrary, that he (M.

The whole of the afore&s;aid quarrel happened in the round-hou&s;e of the Bonne Homme Richard, the 23d or 25th of Augu&s;t, in the above-mentioned year. I conclude by &s;aying, that M. Landais ac|companied or affirmed his offen&s;ive and ve|ry &s;candalous di&s;cour&s;e, by the mo&s;t pro|voking ge&s;tures.</P>

<P>The &s;hip in que&s;tion was the <HI>Indien,</HI> then on the &s;tocks at Am&s;terdam, belonging to the United States. But this having been di&s;covered to the Briti&s;h Mini&s;ter by &s;ome of Mr. Arthur Lee's papers, of which they had got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion ju&s;t before Mr. Paul Jones arrived at Paris, and the Trea|ty of Alliance being on the point to be concluded, he con&s;ented to their a&s;&s;igning over the property of that &s;hip to the King of France. Among the political rea&s;ons which operated this arrangement, was the great oppo&s;ition made to the equipment of the Indien, by the Briti&s;h Amba&s;&s;ador in Holland. The command of the Indien was, however, re&s;erved for Mr. Paul Jones, till (&s;ub&s;equent to his campaign of 1779) he had made an arrangement of a plan with the Count de Maurepas, which promi&s;ed much greater importance to the common cau&s;e, and required his immediate return to America. After this, his Maje&s;ty lent the u&s;e of the Indien to the Prince de Luxembourg for three years, and the Prince <HI>chartered her,</HI> for the term pre|&s;cribed, to Mr. Gillon, of South-Caroli|na, under the commi&s;&s;ion of that State.

This Ship then di&s;appeared, and did not return until an hour and a half; as &s;oon as &s;he was di&s;|covered, Captain Jones ordered the &s;ignal lanthorns of reconnoi&s;&s;ance to be placed at proper di&s;tances from each other, on the larboard &s;ide, which order was obeyed by the Ma&s;ter, notwith&s;tanding, &s;he came up to our larboard quarter and fired into us, then &s;hot a-head and &s;tood athwart our bow, when I hailed, by order from Cap|tain Jones, to lay the enemy on board, to which no an&s;wer was made: Mr. Coram al&s;o repeated the &s;ame order, then a&s;ked them if they heard us, their reply was ay, ay, the in&s;tant after, &s;he raked without apparently drawing any nearer the di&s;tance than being only within the range of grape &s;hot, and the two &s;hips lying parallel with their &s;ides touching each other, &s;everal of his &s;hot were drove into the Bon Homme Richard.

<P>CAPTAIN Landais has oftentimes, in my pre&s;ence, &s;poken di&s;re&s;pectfully and even impudently of Captain Jones. On one occa&s;ion, about the beginning of Sep|tember la&s;t, on the coa&s;t of Scotland, I went on board the Alliance frigate, by de|&s;ire of Captain Jones, and told Captain Landais, that he reque&s;ted of him to be furni&s;hed with the names of the Officers and men he had, a day or two before that, put on board the prize &s;hip the Union, Cap|tain John&s;ton, that he (Captain Jones) might be enabled to di&s;patch her; or to be informed what directions he had given, if any, as well with re&s;pect to that ve&s;&s;el, as al&s;o with re&s;pect to the prize &s;hip, the Bet&s;ey, Captain Fi&s;her, which al&s;o had been manned from the Alliance. Captain Lan|dais, in reply, told me very pertly, that Captain Jones had no bu&s;ine&s;s at all to give orders, or to concern him&s;elf with any of tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els, for that both of them had al|ready received proper in&s;tructions from him; and that the orders he had given were agreeable to the direction he had received from Captain Jones. I told him
<PB N="16" REF="020436_0014_0FAF0BE26BBDC4E8">
I was of opinion no Commander in the &s;quadron, except Captain Jones, was au|thori&s;ed to &s;end away a prize, or other|wi&s;e di&s;po&s;e of her, when in his pre&s;ence, but by virtue of particular orders obtain|ed from him for that purpo&s;e. Captain Landais, in a <HI>&s;neering</HI> manner, again re|plied, that he would let Captain Jones know, that he had as good a right to di&s;|patch prizes as he had; that they were Captains of equal rank; and that the only difference between them was &s;eniority on the part of Captain Jones, which he held of little con&s;ideration: and at la&s;t Colonel Wibert, who had accompanied me on board, and my&s;elf returned on board the Bon Homme Richard, totally unable to in|form Captain Jones what Captain Landais had ordered with re&s;pect to tho&s;e two &s;hips. A &s;hort time after this, a &s;ignal was made on board the Commodore's &s;hip, for the Captains of the &s;quadron to come on board. Captain Cottineau and Captain Ricot accordingly came on board. Captain Landais not obeying, Captain Jones de&s;ired me to go again on board the Alliance, and deliver Captain Landais a letter which he then handed to me, and which I under&s;tood contained an order for him to come imme|diately on board; accordingly I went on board the Alliance, and delivered Captain Landais the letter, which he took with him to the cabin, and in a few minutes returned and delivered me another for Captain Jones: this I brought in&s;tantly on board, and delivered to him. It contained a &s;e|cond refu&s;al on the part of Captain Lan|dais, and very much offended the gentle|men who had politely obeyed the &s;ignal, and were then waiting for him. Captain Jones, chagrined by the ob&s;tinacy or that Officer, would have proceeded to the bu&s;i|ne&s;s he had in view, without paying any fur|ther attention to him; but being &s;till anxi|ous to have his opinion on and approbation of the mea&s;ure, conjointly with the other Officers of the &s;quadron, a further at|tempt to obtain his company was re&s;olved on; for this purpo&s;e (at the de&s;ire of Captain Jones) Captain Cottineau, Mr. Chamillard and my&s;elf went on board the Alliance, to try the effect of per&s;ua&s;ion upon Captain Landais; but in vain did tho&s;e gentlemen repre&s;ent to him the ab|&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity there was for his joining in con&s;ultation with his brother Officers; that the good of the &s;ervice demanded his com|pliance, as an enterprize of &s;ome moment was to be deliberated on; but, alas! in vain did they wa&s;te an hour and more in arguments to this end; in vain did they at|tempt to per&s;uade him; in vain did they entreat him; in vain did they tell him what he had to dread from the con&s;equen|ces of his ob&s;tinately per&s;i&s;ting to di&s;obey the orders of his Commanding Officer. In|&s;tead of paying polite attention to the ad|vice given him, he, on the contrary, not only di&s;regarded it, but gave him&s;elf the liberty to &s;peak of Captain Jones in terms highly di&s;re&s;pectful and in&s;olent, and &s;aid he would &s;ee him on &s;hore, when they mu&s;t kill one or other, &amp;c.</P>
<P>On the 23d September la&s;t, when the &s;ignal for a general cha&s;e was given to pur|&s;ue the Baltic fleet, the Alliance Frigate was the headmo&s;t &s;hip of our &s;quadron, and continued to keep a-head until &s;he began to near the enemy, when Captain Landais very unexpectedly and agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed Capt. Jones by hauling his &s;hip's wind, thereby politely leaving room for his com|mander to approach the large&s;t &s;hip, which he in&s;tantly engaged; Capt. Landais &s;till keeping at a re&s;pectful di&s;tance from his commander, which re&s;pect he however continued to pre&s;erve, mal-a-propos, until very late in the engagement. The action had la&s;ted more than an hour, and the Se|rapis and Bon Homme Richard had been made fa&s;t along-&s;ide each other by Captain Jones, head and &s;tern together, for &s;ome time before I received the wound which obliged me to quit the deck, at which time the Bon Homme Richard &s;till continued a|lone with a force much &s;uperior to her&s;elf; and altho' &s;he had been mo&s;t &s;everely treat|ed by her enemy, &s;he neverthele&s;s conti|nued to hug her in clo&s;e embrace. The
<PB N="17" REF="020436_0015_0FAF0BE358A288A8">
behaviour of our con&s;orts upon this day was very my&s;terious, but that of Captain Landais was of &s;uch a ca&s;t, as, in my opini|on, mu&s;t unavoidably announce him to the public a man devoid of conduct&mdash;a man of infamous principles&mdash;or, a rank coward.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>MATTHEW MEASE. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Mea&s;e, of Philadelphia, was a gen|tleman of a worthy character. He was not bred a &s;eaman, but had many times cro&s;&s;ed the ocean, being a merchant and owner of &s;hips. His love for America (his country) induced him to embark in the Bon Homme Richard, and, the other offices being previou&s;|ly filled, he accepted the place of Pur&s;er. In the engagement with the Serapis, he com|manded the quarter-deck guns of the Bon Homme Richard, and behaved with di&s;tin|gui&s;hed coolne&s;s and intrepidity, 'till he was dangerou&s;ly wounded in the head by a grape &s;hot. The next day his &s;kull was trepanned in &s;ix or &s;even places; but, immediately af|ter the Surgeon had tied up his head in the action, which la&s;ted three hours after his misfortune, he returned again upon deck, and was witne&s;s to all the conduct of the Alliance.</NOTE></SIGNED>

<P>[N. B. The Alliance having received no &s;hot from the enemy, her Captain had the <HI>advantage</HI> to have none of his men ei|ther killed or wounded during the whole engagement. And it is highly worthy of remark, that before the Alliance raked the Bon Homme Richard by firing alternately into her head and &s;tern, the enemy had been di&s;lodged and driven from the tops and quarter-deck of the Serapis to her fir&s;t and &s;econd batteries, where they were under cover; whereas, the di&s;charge of the &s;e|cond battery afore&s;aid having beaten in one &s;ide of the Bon Homme Richard and blown out the other, &s;o as to make a breach from before the main-ma&s;t to the &s;tern, inclu&s;ive of the &s;tern-po&s;t and rudder, which were cut off, had ferreted out and di&s;lodged all the per&s;ons who had been there &s;kulking: They had taken a new po&s;t for &s;afety, on the foreca&s;tle of the Bon Homme Richard, where they could not be fired upon from the Serapis, but were expo&s;ed to the fire of the Alliance, as well as the officers and men who had behaved gallantly from the beginning.]</P>

<P>The following extract of a Letter from Dr. Franklin to Capt. Landais, dated Pa&s;&s;y, March 12, 1780, and which he has publi&s;hed, will &s;erve to give a further in&s;ight into his character:</P>
<P><Q>NO one has ever learned the opi|nion I formed of you from the enquiry made into your conduct&mdash;I kept it en|tirely to my&s;elf&mdash;I have not even hint|ed it in my letters to America, becau&s;e I would not hazard giving to any one a bias to your prejudice. By communi|cating <HI>a part of that opinion</HI> privately to you, I can do no harm, for you may burn it. I &s;hould not give you the pain of reading it, if your demand did not make it nece&s;&s;ary: I think you then &s;o imprudent, &s;o litigious and quarrel|&s;ome a man, even with your be&s;t friends, that peace and good order, and con&s;e|quently the quiet and regular &s;ubordi|nation &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ucce&s;s, are, where you pre&s;ide, impo&s;&s;ible; the&s;e are with|in my ob&s;ervation and apprehen&s;ion:&mdash; Your military operations I leave to more capable judges. If, therefore, I had twenty &s;hips of war in my di&s;po&s;iti|on, I &s;hould not give one of them to Captain Landais: The &s;ame temper which <HI>excluded</HI> him from the French marine <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">He impo&s;ed him&s;elf on America as having been Captain of a &s;hip of the line, in the navy of France; but the fact ra|ther appears to be, that having been placed under the Capitaine du Port, or Ma&s;ter Attendant of the Port of Bre&s;t, he was not in the line of promotion of the corps of Officers of the marine, (Capitaine de Bru|lot, and &s;everal other &s;ubaltern grades, ha|ving no affinity to the re&s;pective duty re|quired of tho&s;e under officers in that &s;er|vice, are in the &s;ame predicament) and therefore he never had, and could not have attained the rank of <HI>Lieutenant de Vai&s;&s;eau,</HI> or even En&s;ign in the Royal Na|vy. After he had given ten years trial of his <HI>temper</HI> and <HI>talents,</HI> he had been di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed from the &s;ervice of France without honors or a pen&s;ion; and was adrift for &s;everal years, when, in the year 1777, he prevailed on Mr. Deane, by con&s;tant ap|plication, to take him into the &s;ervice of America. He told Mr. Deane he had been formerly appointed Captain of a &s;hip of the line, and had been <HI>&s;acrificed</HI> by jea|lou&s;y. But this pretended <HI>line of battle &s;hip</HI> was nothing but an old tran&s;port ve&s;|&s;el that had been condemned and di&s;arm|ed, as unfit for war. Mr. Landais was employed to bring a tran&s;port ve&s;&s;el from France to America, with a brevet of Cap|tain in the American navy, and an extra gratification of twelve thou&s;and livres&mdash; he arrived in America about the time when the alliance was concluded with France; and Congre&s;s not only confirmed his brevet, but al&s;o appointed him Captain of the be&s;t fri|gate in their &s;ervice, then ju&s;t launched, and named her the ALLIANCE. This was in|tended as a compliment to his Mo&s;t Chri&s;|tian Maje&s;ty, therefore Congre&s;s had been gro&s;sly impo&s;ed upon. Since he has been turned out of the American &s;ervice, it is &s;aid, and believed, he has been con&s;tantly complaining, abu&s;ing the mo&s;t re&s;pectable characters, and &s;aying he has been again <HI>"&s;acrificed"</HI> by a general combination; beginning with Dr. Franklin. He has at|tacked the ju&s;tice of Congre&s;s, and of all per&s;ons in authority under the &s;overeignty: Yet his pecuniary advantages have not been le&s;s con&s;iderable (exclu&s;ive of the twelve thou&s;and livres gratuity) than if he had left the &s;ervice of his own accord, and with honor.</NOTE> would weigh equally with me; of cour&s;e I &s;hall not replace him in the Alliance.</Q></P>
