<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>THE valuable writings of that pious chri&s;tian, <HI>William Penn,</HI> of which I am a great admirer, as they appear to be written from the heart, with a view to promote the happine&s;s of mankind in general; I therefore &s;incerely wi&s;h they were more gene|rally read and attended to than I believe they are.&mdash; But being &s;en&s;ible that many are deprived of the advan|tage of his writings, from their inability to purcha&s;e them (being compri&s;ed in two large and expen&s;ive volumes)&mdash;I have thought it my duty to get this &s;hort Extract printed, (containing a very intere&s;ting Summons, &amp;c. to the World) in a &s;mall pamphlet, for the benefit of &s;uch who are not able to purcha&s;e his works, as well as the Public in general; to whom I beg leave to recommend it as what is of infinite concern to them.&mdash; I &s;ub&s;cribe my&s;elf a well-wi&s;her to the happine&s;s of mankind in general.</P>

The faces of nations &s;hall gather palene&s;s, and their knees &s;mite together, becau&s;e of the anger of <HI>God,</HI> that is kindling again&s;t them, and his fierce wrath, that is revealing from heaven again&s;t all the ungodly, but more e&s;pecially again&s;t the children of the <HI>my&s;tery</HI> of <HI>iniquity:</HI> 'Tis in this day that the kindreds of the earth &s;hall mourn with a great lamentation.</P>

Does he rule there? Then have you eternal life abiding in you: If not, you are not <HI>true Chri&s;tians.</HI> The <HI>&s;pirit</HI> of <HI>truth</HI> leadeth into all <HI>truth;</HI> and the <HI>children of God</HI> are born of it, and led by it. But are you led into all the holy <HI>ways</HI> of <HI>truth,</HI> born of this eternal &s;pirit?

<P>O you, that are called <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> give ear a little unto me, for I am pre&s;t in &s;pirit to write to you: Read with patience, and con&s;ider my words; for behold, what I have to &s;ay to you concerneth your eternal good.</P>

They are blind to the things of God's kingdom, and un&s;en&s;ible of true and &s;piritual <HI>life,</HI> and <HI>motion,</HI> what it is to live to God: And in that &s;tate, are alienated from God, without true judgment and living knowledge; and under the cur&s;e. For in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the <HI>light</HI> of the <HI>world,</HI> are hid all the trea&s;ures of wi&s;dom and knowledge, redemption and glory; they are hid from the <HI>worldly chri&s;tian,</HI> from all that are captivated by the &s;pirit and lu&s;ts of the world: And whoever would &s;ee them, (for therein con&s;i&s;t the things, that belong to their eternal peace) mu&s;t come to Chri&s;t Je&s;us the true <HI>light</HI> in their con&s;ciences, bring their deeds to him, love him and obey him; whom God hath ordained a <HI>light to lighten the Gentiles, and for his Sal|vation to the ends of the earth.

<P>But this is the great <HI>condemnation</HI> of the <HI>world</HI> at this day, that though <HI>God</HI> hath &s;ent his <HI>&s;on</HI> a <HI>light</HI> into the hearts of all men and women, to manife&s;t and reprove their evil deeds, and to &s;ave them; yet they love <HI>darkne&s;s,</HI> they love the lu&s;ts and imagina|tions of their vain hearts, better than this holy <HI>light,</HI> that is given unto them for <HI>&s;alvation:</HI> They chu&s;e <HI>Barabbas</HI> rather than <HI>Je&s;us.</HI> Yea they have &s;et up other <HI>lights,</HI> than Chri&s;t Je&s;us, <HI>God's</HI> great <HI>light;</HI> and other <HI>prophets</HI> than <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> God's great <HI>prophet;</HI> and other <HI>prie&s;ts</HI> than <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> the <HI>High-Prie&s;t</HI> of the new covenant: But they are <HI>dark lights, fal&s;e prophets,</HI> and <HI>blind prie&s;ts. All that came before me,</HI> &s;aith Chri&s;t, <HI>are thieves and robbers:</HI> And all that pray, preach, &s;ing, wor&s;hip, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and not by the <HI>light</HI> and <HI>&s;pirit</HI> of Je&s;us, they go before Chri&s;t, before Chri&s;t cometh, before he prepareth their hearts, and toucheth their lips with a coal, from his heavenly altar; and perform wor&s;hip in their own will, time and power, and &s;tay not for his leadings. And therefore all &s;uch rob <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> of his <HI>office,</HI> who is the <HI>leader</HI> of the true <HI>chri&s;tians,</HI> their heavenly <HI>High-Prie&s;t,</HI> to anoint them, and offer up their &s;acrifice to God for them; and <HI>prophet,</HI> to let them &s;ee and know by his <HI>light,</HI> in

<P>Now this is the que&s;tion to the whole world called Chri&s;tians: <HI>Do you &s;ee with this divine light? Have you &s;earched your hearts with it?

And doth he order your minds, and rule your affections? If not, you are <HI>thieves</HI> and <HI>robbers;</HI> for you rob <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> of his <HI>office.</HI> For God hath appointed him to be the <HI>leader</HI> and <HI>ruler</HI> of all people; yea, 'tis God's decree; and tho&s;e that he leadeth not in their thoughts, words, and works, &s;hall never come to God: For all mu&s;t come to God by him, that is, by his <HI>light,</HI> and <HI>&s;pirit</HI> ruling in their hearts, which &s;anctifieth, regenerateth, and converteth the &s;oul to God.</P>
