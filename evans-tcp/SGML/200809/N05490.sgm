<HEAD>The Servant ready and waiting for the Coming of his LORD.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>LUK. XII.35, 36, 37.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Let your Loins be girded about, and your Lights burning: and ye your &s;elves like unto Men, that wait for their Lord, when he will return from the Wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh they may open to him immedi|ately. Ble&s;&s;ed are tho&s;e Servants, whom the Lord when he cometh &s;hall find watching.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_WATCHFULNESS is the great Duty which our Lord is here pre&s;&s;ing upon his Di&s;ci|ples; that they might be in actual Rea|dine&s;s for his Coming, at what Time &s;o|ever it &s;hall be, whether &s;ooner or later; <HI>at the &s;econd or third Watch of the Night,</HI> &vers;. 38. And here our Saviour con&s;iders them as Servants, and from thence argues their Obligation to Watchfulne&s;s, and a con&s;tant Readine&s;s for his Coming. And he takes the Argument from the Cu&s;tom of Servants (that is faith|ful Servants) watching and waiting for the coming home of their Ma&s;ters, when gone Abroad, e&s;pecially to a Wed|ding, when it was very uncertain at what Hour of the Night they would come Home. Now in &s;uch Ca&s;es, the
<PB N="2" REF="006956_0003_102AC4B1079A5D88">
Ma&s;ter required, &amp; expected, and the good Servant would, accordingly be in Readine&s;s to open to his Ma&s;ter and let him in, whenever he knocked at the Door. The good Servant in&s;tead of being a&s;leep, and all in the Dark, when his Ma&s;ter came home, tho' late at Night; would be a|wake, with his loo&s;e Garment girt about his Loins, that it might not be in the Way to hinder or retard him in run|ning and opening to his Ma&s;ter immediately. But then, it being in the Night, Lights would be nece&s;&s;ary for the Reception of his Ma&s;ter: Accordingly the watchful &s;er|vant will take Care not only to have Candles or Lamps, with Oil, in the Room, but to have them lighted, &amp; actu|ally burning; that he might not have the lea&s;t Thing to hinder him; but &s;o &s;oon as ever he heard his Ma&s;ter's Knock he might open to him immediately, and his Ma&s;ter find every Thing in readine&s;s.</P>
<P>And now from this Cu&s;tom our Saviour takes Occa&s;ion to recommend the &s;ame Watchfulne&s;s, and actual Readi|ne&s;s to his Di&s;ciples for his Coming, how &s;oon or &s;udden &s;oever it &s;hall be. <HI>Let your Loins be girded about, and your Lights burning, and ye your &s;elves like unto Men that wait for their Lord &amp;c.</HI> And &s;o our Saviour explains him&s;elf, &vers;. 40. <HI>Be ye therefore ready al&s;o, for the Son of Man cometh in an Hour when ye think not.</HI> If Chri&s;t's Coming here, has a primary Reference to his coming to judge the Jews in the De&s;truction of Jeru&s;alem, and Di&s;&s;olution of the Jewi&s;h State; yet it may refer to his coming to particular Per|&s;ons at Death; and his coming to judge the World at the la&s;t Day: of which the De&s;truction of Jeru&s;alem may be con&s;idered as an eminent Type, or lively Emblem. And if we con&s;ider his coming at Death, or at the Judgment; they are both utterly uncertain as to the Time. We know neither the Day, and much le&s;s the Hour, when the Son of Man &s;hall come. As to his coming by Death, we know in general, that it cannot be far off: But whether he will come early in the Evening, or in the &s;econd Watch, or in the third Watch of the Night, even to advanced old Age, who can &s;ay, before it comes to pa&s;s? &mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="006956_0004_102AC4B348B435E0">And now, as I have already ob&s;erved, that the&s;e Words have an Eye to the Manner of a faithful Servant, who ex|pecting his Ma&s;ter to come Home: But not knowing at what Hour, endeavours to have every Thing in actual Readine&s;s; that whether he comes &s;ooner or later, he may open to him immediately: So I &s;hall carry on this Similitude thro' my Di&s;cour&s;e, as what may afford many in&s;tructive Thoughts to us.</P>
<P>Accordingly, what I propo&s;e is,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. To con&s;ider this Direction of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, to <HI>have our Loins girded about.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. What it is to have <HI>our Lights burning.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Agreable hereto, I &s;hall de&s;cribe the Man, the Chri&s;ti|an, who is thus <HI>waiting for the Coming of his Lord.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>4. I &s;hall then con&s;ider <HI>the Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s</HI> of all who are in &s;uch a watching, waiting Frame.</ITEM>

</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. Let us con&s;ider this Direction of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord: <HI>Let your Loins be girded about.</HI></P>
<P>Now this, as I hinted, has Reference to the Manner of tho&s;e Nations, who were wont to wear long &amp; loo&s;e Gar|ments, which they were obliged to gird or tuck up, when they engaged in any Bu&s;ine&s;s, that they might not be in their Way to fetter, intangle or hinder them. And thus Servants to be ready to wait upon their Ma&s;ters at their coming home, girded their Garments about their Loins: And would not have &s;o much as this to do, when their Ma&s;ter knocked: And would be thus girded up all the Evening; and to the &s;econd, and third, and fourth Watch of the Night, if their Ma&s;ters tarried &s;o long.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="006956_0005_102AC4B5CF05B7E8"><HI>Que&s;t.</HI> And now, <HI>What Instruction does this afford to Chri&s;tians: what would Chri&s;t have his Servants do, corre&s;|ponding with this</HI>?</P>
<P>An&s;. 1. <HI>It is a Call to Chri&s;tians to &s;hake off all their Sleep and Drow&s;ine&s;s, and be in a wakeful Frame.</HI></P>
<P>The Servant's girding up his Loins to be ready for his Ma&s;ter's coming, &s;uppo&s;es him to be awake, and ready for Bu&s;ine&s;s. So when Chri&s;t &s;ays to his Di&s;ciples, Gird up your Loins; it is as much as to &s;ay, Chri&s;tians mu&s;t &s;hake off all their Dulne&s;s, Drow&s;ine&s;s, and Sloth, and get and keep in a wakeful watchful Frame.&mdash; As for Sinners, they are in a Sleep, in a Sort of dead Sleep, and the Call of the Go&s;pel to &s;uch is that, in Eph. v.14. <HI>Awake thou that &s;leepest, and ari&s;e from the Dead, and Chri&s;t &s;hall give thee Life.</HI> And as for real Chri&s;tians, they are exceeding apt to be drow&s;y and &s;leepy in the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Religion, and Service of Chri&s;t. The Things of Time and Sen&s;e lull them a&s;leep. In the Parable of the Virgins, the wi&s;e are repre&s;ented as &s;lumbring as well as the fooli&s;h, Matth. 25.5. <HI>While the Bridegroom tarried, they all &s;lumbred and &s;lept.</HI> But now, when Chri&s;t &s;ays to Chri&s;tians, <HI>Let your Loins be girded about</HI>; it is as much as to &s;ay, Awake out of all your Slumbers, row&s;e up and be&s;tir your &s;elves in the Service of Chri&s;t and of your Souls. &mdash; And &s;urely con&s;idering we know not when our Lord will come, it concerns us to &s;hake off all our Drow&s;ine&s;s, le&s;t coming he find us &s;leeping. And this is to have all our Powers awake; and we ready to every Duty and Service God calls us unto.&mdash;It is a&s;toni&s;hing to think, what dull drow&s;y and &s;lothful Frames Chri&s;tians fall into, con&s;idering we know not but the Lord is at Hand, that He the Judge is before the Door; and may knock by the Me&s;&s;enger of Death this very Night. Wherefore when Chri&s;t &s;ays in the Text, <HI>Let your Loins be girded about</HI>; you mu&s;t con&s;i|der him &s;peaking to them, as in Rom. 13.11. <HI>And that knowing the Time, that it is high Time to awake out of Sleep; for now is your Salvation nearer than when you at fir&s;t be|lieved.</HI> And in 1 The&s;. v.6. <HI>Therefore let us not &s;leep as do others, but let us watch and be &s;ober.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="006956_0006_102AC4B93A676698">An&s;. 2. <HI>It intends the laying a&s;ide every Thing that would fetter, clogg or hinder us in any of the Duty and Service that Chri&s;t our Lord calls us unto.</HI></P>
<P>The Servant was to gird his Garment about his Loins, that it might not hang in his Way, when he was waiting upon his Ma&s;ter. And the good and watchful Servant who expected his Ma&s;ter to knock at the Door, in&s;tead of having his Garment hang loo&s;e, girded it about him, that he might run without any Delay to open unto him. And be&s;ides, he knew not what his Ma&s;ter might have for him to do when he came in: and therefore would have his Garment girded about him, &s;o as to be no Ob&s;truction to him. Accordingly, when Chri&s;t calls upon us Chri&s;tians to have our Loins girded about; it intends that we &s;hould as much as po&s;&s;ible get every Thing out of the Way, that would hinder us in our Chri&s;tian Cour&s;e, or keep us in an un&s;uitable Frame for the Coming of Chri&s;t at Death. It intends that we lay a&s;ide every Thing that would put us into an unfit Po&s;ture for Death to meet us in.</P>
<P>Here then, as Sin and Corruption working in our Hearts, would be very un&s;uitable, and very much indi&s;po&s;e &amp; hinder us from a due Attendance upon Chri&s;t at Death; &s;o to gird our Loins, is to get rid as much as po&s;&s;ible of the Workings of Sin &amp; Corruption within us. While Lu&s;ts of any Kind prevail, a Man is as unprepared for the Coming of Chri&s;t by Death, as the Servant is to run and wait upon his Ma&s;ter, with all his Garments hanging loo&s;e about him. So that to gird up your Loins, &amp; be in a wait|ing Po&s;ture for your Lord, is to be getting rid of every vicious Habit, with all your Might, &s;triving again&s;t corrupt Nature, and all the out-breakings of it: calling in the Aids of the divine Spirit to &s;ubdue it for you. Whatever Lu&s;t you find begins to work within you, it mu&s;t be op|po&s;ed with all your Might, con&s;idering how un&s;uitable it will be for you to be intangled with any Lu&s;t, when Chri&s;t the Lord &s;hall knock at the Door by the Me&s;&s;enger of Death.&mdash; And therefore, when Pride, or Pa&s;&s;ion, or Cove|teou&s;ne&s;s, or Carnality, begin to work in your Hearts; then con&s;ider with your &s;elves, and &s;ay, Is this a proper
<PB N="6" REF="006956_0007_102AC4BB76E694A8">
Po&s;ture for Death to find me in? Is this a fit Frame for a dying Man? If Chri&s;t my Lord &s;hould now come and call for me, is this a fit Temper to meet him in? Now &s;uch like Reflections would put us upon girding up our Loins. And Oh! what Strength would it give us to re|&s;i&s;t and repel a Temptation to Sin, to con&s;ider and &s;ay within our &s;elves, that for aught we know, Chri&s;t our Lord and Ma&s;ter may be at the Door ready to call for us; and how &s;hall we, while under the Power of Sin and Cor|ruption, be ready to meet him, or even to look him in the Face?</P>
<P>An&s;. 3. <HI>But then this girding up the Loins may more e&s;pecially intend the laying a&s;ide the Sin that mo&s;t ea&s;ily be&s;ets us; and which we are mo&s;t liable to fall into.</HI></P>
<P>The Sins which Chri&s;tians are more particularly addict|ed to, are like long loo&s;e Garments that are always in the Way, hindring from many good Things, that otherwi&s;e might be done by us. There is nothing that &s;o much comes in the Way, and hinders a Man in running the Chri&s;tian Race, &amp; from preparing for the Coming of Chri&s;t by Death and Judgment, as his own particular Sin, his Con&s;titution Sin, or the Sin he has been long accu&s;tomed to; or that to which he is peculiarly expo&s;ed, by his Call|ing, by his Place, and Station in the World, by the Com|pany he is in the Way of, and the Examples and Entice|ments of Sinners, that he is unavoidably expo&s;ed unto. The&s;e, I &s;ay, are the Sins that fetter us, and hinder us from being in a due Preparation for the Coming of Chri&s;t. Accordingly, the Apo&s;tle lets the Chri&s;tian Hebrews know, that as ever they would run the Chri&s;tian Race &s;et before them, <HI>they must lay a&s;ide the Sin that ea&s;ily be&s;ets them,</HI> Heb. xii.1. The Sin that encompa&s;&s;es, that cla&s;ps, or clings round about them; as their long Garments did, to which the Apo&s;tle &s;eems to refer. And therefore, as tho&s;e Gar|ments were to be laid a&s;ide, or girded up before they were fit for Bu&s;ine&s;s; &s;o tho&s;e Sins that cla&s;p, and cling round about us, &s;o as to fetter and intangle us in running the Chri&s;tian Race, mu&s;t be put out of the Way. Whether our particular Sin be Pride, or Pa&s;&s;ionatene&s;s, or Envy, or
<PB N="7" REF="006956_0008_102AC4BF03845848">
Malice: whether it be Unbelief, or Di&s;tru&s;t, or Di&s;con|tent: Whether it be Worldly-mindedne&s;s, or Carnality: Whether it be Idlene&s;s, or Sloth, or Voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, or In|temperance. I &s;ay, whatever it be, we mu&s;t with all our Might labour to get rid of it, as ever we would be ready to meet Chri&s;t at his Coming. &mdash; For con&s;ider, I be&s;eech you, how unfit you will be for the Coming of the Son of Man, while you are intangled with any of the&s;e Lu&s;ts? Who can think him&s;elf in a fit Po&s;ture to meet Chri&s;t at Death, and at the Judgment, with his Mind puffed up with Pride and Vanity? or his Spirit broiling with angry Pa&s;&s;ions, and breathing out Threatnings and Revenges? or who has his Heart &s;wallowed up with worldly Cares, and earthly Affections; or is wallowing in &s;inful Plea&s;ures? Surely this, to keep to the Similitude before us, would be as improper, and as unbecoming, as it would be for a Ser|vant who is ordered to wait for his Ma&s;ter's com|ing home, to have all his Cloaths hanging &s;o about him, and be &s;o intangled with them, that he could not &s;o much as ari&s;e and open the Door to him.&mdash;And this may &s;uffice to &s;hew what our Saviour means, when he calls upon his Di&s;ciples to have their <HI>Loins girded about.</HI> &mdash; It is to rou&s;e up out of all our Sleepine&s;s and Dulne&s;s, and exert our &s;elves with Life, Spirit and Activity, in the Service of Chri&s;t; and to lay a&s;ide every Sin, and e&s;pecially every Sin that does mo&s;t ea&s;ily be&s;et us, as what will hinder us from being in a &s;uitable Readine&s;s for the Coming of our Lord.</P>
<P N="2">II. I proceed now to con&s;ider the next Word of Ad|vice, viz. <HI>And your Lights burning.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>And this I &s;aid, refers al&s;o to the Manner of Servants waiting for their Ma&s;ter's coming home in the Night, let it be what Hour of the Night it would; whether early or late, the Servant took Care not only to have Candles or Lamps, and Oil in them, ready to light: but had his Lamps actually lighted, and burning, that when the Ma&s;ter knocked at the Door, he might not then have the Lamps
<PB N="8" REF="006956_0009_102AC4C1B1CDEC78">
to light up; but being already lighted, might go imme|diately, and open to him, and light him into the Room, where the Lights were burning, and all Things ready to receive him.</P>
<P>Que&s;t. And now, <HI>What are we to understand by our Saviour's calling upon his Servants, thus to have their Lights burning?</HI></P>
<P>An&s;w. in General, <HI>It intends, that Chri&s;tians &s;hould &s;ee to it, that they have all Things in actual Readine&s;s for the Com|ing of the Son of Man at Death.</HI></P>
<P>The Servant mu&s;t have not only &s;ome Lamps and Ap|pearance of what afforded Light; but there mu&s;t be Oil in the Lamps; and not only Oil in the Lamps, but they mu&s;t be actually lighted up, and burning. Agreable to this, there mu&s;t be in Chri&s;tians, not only an outward Shew and Appearance of Readine&s;s; but there mu&s;t be a real habitual Readine&s;s: and not only &s;o, but an actual Readine&s;s for the Coming of Chri&s;t. &mdash; So then, to keep to the Similitude of my Text, let me &s;ay&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>If you would be in Readine&s;s for the Coming of the Son of Man, you mu&s;t have at lea&s;t a Lamp of outward Profe&s;&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>A Lamp is the Emblem of an outward Profe&s;&s;ion. So our Saviour is under&s;tood in his Parable of the ten Vir|gins, Matth. xxv.1. <HI>The Kingdom of Heaven is likened unto ten Virgins who took their Lamps, and went forth to meet the Bridegroom.</HI> &vers;. 3. <HI>They that were fooli&s;h took their Lamps; but took no Oil with them.</HI> Which is univer&s;ally interpre|ted of the Profe&s;&s;ion which they made. And a Lamp is a fit Emblem of an outward Profe&s;&s;ion; as might ea&s;ily be &s;hewn. And now, it is the Duty of all under the Go&s;|pel to have a Lamp of a fair Profe&s;&s;ion. That Servant who has not &s;o much as a Lamp, is not in any Readine&s;s for his Ma&s;ter's coming home in the Night: No more are Per&s;ons under the Go&s;pel prepared for the Coming of Chri&s;t, without a free, fair, and open Profe&s;&s;ion of him. The Servant was to have his Lamps, the Form and Ap|pearance of Light; &s;o you mu&s;t have the Form and Ap|pearance of Religion. Not that this will by any Means
<PB N="9" REF="006956_0010_102AC4C33662BAC0">
an&s;wer the End of it &s;elf, any more than an empty Lamp would an&s;wer the End to give Light: But as a Lamp is nece&s;&s;ary to contain that which affords the Light; &s;o a Profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t is nece&s;&s;ary to our being Chri&s;tians. Altho' many Profe&s;&s;ors will be di&s;owned and rejected of Chri&s;t hereafter; yet if we don't profe&s;s him to be our Lord, and freely acknowledge him before Men, he will finally di&s;own and reject us. Matth. x.32.33. <HI>Who&s;oever therefore &s;hall confe&s;s me before Men, him will I confe&s;s before my Father which is in Heaven. But who&s;oever &s;hall deny me before Men, him will I deny before my Father which is in Heaven.</HI> So that the denying Chri&s;t, or neglecting and re|fu&s;ing to own him (which is a Sort of denying him) is not &s;o light a Thing as &s;ome People imagine; but it is highly requi&s;ite to our being ready for the Coming of the Son of Man, that we make an open Profe&s;&s;ion of him.</P>
<P>That Servant would be look'd upon as very far from being ready for his Ma&s;ter's coming home in the Night, who had not &s;o much as a Lamp or Candle in the Hou&s;e. And let me tell you, that if you have not &s;o much as the Lamp of a Chri&s;tian Profe&s;&s;ion, you are as far from being prepared for the Coming of Chri&s;t at Death or the Judg|ment.</P>
<P>Indeed there are Degrees of Profe&s;&s;ion; but we &s;hould labour to &s;tand compleat in our Chri&s;tian Profe&s;&s;ion, and to walk in all the Commandments, &amp; come up to all the Ordi|nances of the Lord. And as for &s;uch, who thro' Carele&s;ne&s;s or indulged Sloth, or Ba&s;hfulne&s;s, neglect to make a full Pro|fe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t, or to come up to his holy Ordinances; they are in a very poor Readine&s;s for Death or Judgment. For &s;uppo&s;ing that Chri&s;t the Ma&s;ter &s;hould knock at your Door by the Me&s;&s;enger of Death; and after that, you &s;hould be called to Judgment, what Excu&s;e could you make to the Ma&s;ter, that you had not &s;o much as owned him, or openly profe&s;&s;ed him to be your Lord?</P>
<P>Wherefore let all &s;uch who are unbaptized; or being come to Years of Di&s;cretion, neglect to renew their bapti&s;|mal Covenant, and to take the Bonds thereof upon them|&s;elves, or to &s;eal the &s;ame at the holy Sacrament of the Supper:
<PB N="10" REF="006956_0011_102AC4C4B7D165F0">
And when the Neglect hereof is thro' Carele&s;ne&s;s &amp; a Spirit of Indifferency, or thro' Ba&s;hfulne&s;s, and a being a&s;hamed to make &s;uch a publick Appearance, con&s;ider tho&s;e awful, and very awakening Words of our Saviour, Matth. viii.38. <HI>Who&s;oever therefore &s;hall be a&s;hamed of me and of my Words in this adulterous and &s;inful Generation, of him al&s;o &s;hall the Son of Man be a&s;hamed when he cometh in the Glory of the Father with his holy Angels.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>If we would be in Readine&s;s for the Coming of Chri&s;t, we must have not only the Lamp of a fair Profe&s;&s;ion; but the Oil of true Grace in the Heart.</HI></P>
<P>The Servant who waits for the coming home of his Ma&s;ter, don't content him&s;elf with having a Number of empty Lamps hanging about in the Room, or in the En|try; but he &s;ees that there be Oil in them, that will burn and afford Light unto his Ma&s;ter.&mdash; So what Chri&s;t re|quires of us as ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to our being in Readi|ne&s;s for his Comng, is the Oil of true Grace in the Heart. There is no Man is or can be in Readine&s;s for the Coming of the Son of Man, without this. For altho', a publick Profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t, and of his holy Religion, be our in|di&s;pen&s;ible Duty; yet a bare empty Profe&s;&s;ion will not an&s;wer the End, any more than empty Lamps will &s;erve to give Light in the Room. A Soul empty of true Grace, is like an empty Lamp, and is utterly unprepared for the Coming of Chri&s;t by Death, or to the Judgment.&mdash;There mu&s;t be a gracious Change wrought in Mens Hearts by the Spirit of God: There mu&s;t be the Seeds and Princi|ples of every Grace, and &s;o that which is called the Habit of Grace: And if Chri&s;t &s;hould come to any by Death before they are thus endowed with the Grace of God, alas for &s;uch poor Souls! they will be lo&s;t &amp; undone for ever. There mu&s;t be the Habit of Faith, true Faith; <HI>for without Faith it is impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e God; and he who believes not &s;hall be damned.</HI> Mar. xvi.16. There mu&s;t be the Grace of true Repentance towards God, as well as Faith in our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t: <HI>For unle&s;s we repent, we &s;hall all likewi&s;e peri&s;h,</HI> Luk. xiii.3. There mu&s;t be a Principle of Holi|ne&s;s
<PB N="11" REF="006956_0012_102AC4CACFB74508">
in the Heart, and the Practice of it in the Life: For <HI>without Holine&s;s no Man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord,</HI> Heb. xii.14. And the &s;ame may be &s;aid as to the Love of God, and as to the Love of our Neighbour, and to Humility, and Patience, Self-denial, and every other Grace. For this Habit of Grace in the Soul, is the very Thing that prepares for the Coming, and Pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t. Let a Man have every Thing el&s;e; yet if this one Thing be lacking, he cannot be ready for the Coming of Chri&s;t. Let a Man make never &s;o high a Profe&s;&s;ion, and appear never &s;o reli|gious, and be never &s;o confident about him&s;elf, and his own Readine&s;s for Death and Judgment: Let him &s;ay never &s;o much of his waiting and longing for his Di&s;&s;olu|tion and Departure, in the confident Expectation or A&s;&s;u|rance of his going to be with Chri&s;t; yet if the Habit of true Grace be wanting, he is by no Means fit for that awful Change: And if Chri&s;t &s;hould come to him while in &s;uch a gracele&s;s State, all his confident Boa&s;ts, and high Expectations will only expo&s;e him to a greater Di&s;ap|pointment. "For what is the Hope of the Hypocrite, tho' he hath gained, when God taketh away his Soul?" The deplorable Ca&s;e of &s;uch is repre&s;ented by the fooli&s;h Vir|gins in the Parable, who had Lamps, but no Oil to keep them burning: and while they were running about &s;eek|ing and begging for Oil, <HI>Behold the Bridegroom came, and they that were ready went in with him to the Marriage; and the Door was &s;hut:</HI> And when they came and cried, <HI>&s;aying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; He an&s;wered and &s;aid, Verily, I know you not,</HI> Matth. xxv. at the Beginning.</P>
<P N="3">3. If we would be in all due Readine&s;s for the Coming of Chri&s;t by Death, we mu&s;t have not only the Lamp of a fair Profe&s;&s;ion, and the Oil of true Grace in the Heart; <HI>but the Lamp mu&s;t be lighted, and actually burning</HI>; i. e. <HI>this true Grace must be in lively Exerci&s;e:</HI> &mdash; And <HI>your Lights burning,</HI> is the Direction of the Text. The Servant who waited for the coming of his Ma&s;ter, kept his Lights burn|ing all the Evening, even to the third or fourth Watch of the Night, if his Ma&s;ter did not come before. And this
<PB N="12" REF="006956_0013_102AC4CC55A62128">
Advice to the Chri&s;tian, is to have his Graces in lively and vigorous Exerci&s;e. What Chri&s;t here recommends to his Di&s;ciples, is not only an habitual, but an actual Readi|ne&s;s for his Coming; and in Order to it, recommends not only the Habit, but the lively Exerci&s;e of Grace. &mdash; As for the Habit of Grace, it belongs to every true Chri|&s;tian; for it is the gracious Habit that makes the true Chri&s;tian. But this Habit, when it is not in lively Exer|ci&s;e, is like Oil in the Lamp, but not lighted up, or only &s;o lighted as that it &s;carce affords any Light at all, and is &s;o dim, that it can hardly be di&s;cerned: or &s;o poor a Light, that it &s;eems to be ju&s;t going out. But now, the Direction of our Lord is to have our Lights burning; that is, burning bright &amp; &s;trong; which is to have Grace in lively Exerci&s;e, as the be&s;t Preparative for his certain and &s;udden Coming by Death and Judgment.</P>
<P>Thus we may not content our &s;elves with a &s;uppo&s;ed Principle of Faith or of Repentance: But there mu&s;t be the Exerci&s;e, the lively Exerci&s;e of Repentance towards God, and of Faith in our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. And as there mu&s;t be the Principle or Habit of Love to God, &s;o there mu&s;t be the Exerci&s;e of it: The Heart mu&s;t be filled with the highe&s;t E&s;teem of him, and carried out in mo&s;t ardent De&s;ires after him, and in the highe&s;t Delight and Satisfaction in him, which mu&s;t &s;weetly but power|fully carry us on in a Cour&s;e of &s;incere and chearful Obe|dience to him: <HI>For this is the Love of God that we keep his Commandments; and his Commandments are not grievous.</HI>&mdash; So again, there mu&s;t be not only the Habit of true Love and Charity to our Neighbour; but the Soul mu&s;t be actually going forth in &s;incere Wi&s;hes and &s;ervent Prayers for their Welfare; and we mu&s;t be much in Acts of real Goodne&s;s and Kindne&s;s to them, as we have Ability and Opportunity for it. So again, there mu&s;t be not only the Principle of Humility; but we mu&s;t be cloathed with Humility; and we mu&s;t walk humbly with our God: and there mu&s;t be a conde&s;cending to Men, even to Men of low Degree. Again, as there mu&s;t be the Habit of Patience, &s;o this mu&s;t be put forth in a patient bearing
<PB N="13" REF="006956_0014_102AC4CEC05D98F0">
every Evil we meet withal. And then there mu&s;t be not only a &s;elf-denying Spirit; but there mu&s;t be an actual denying our &s;elves: there mu&s;t be a denying our Self-Will, our Self-Humour, or Self-Honour, or Self-Ea&s;e, or Self-Intere&s;t, as the Cau&s;e of God, and the real Good of others, calls for it. And now to have Grace thus in Exerci&s;e, is to have our Lights burning.</P>
<P>And here I would further &s;ay, that for Per&s;ons to ima|gine they have the Principle of Grace in their Hearts; and yet not to Exerci&s;e it in their Lives, is a &s;ad Sign that they are ignorant of them&s;elves, and think them|&s;elves &s;omething, when indeed they are nothing; for Grace in the Heart will &s;ome how or other manife&s;t it&s;elf in the Life, Matth. xii.35. <HI>A good Man out of the good Trea&s;ure of his Heart bringeth forth good Things.</HI></P>
<P>I don't &s;ay, that wherever there is a Principle of Grace, there is always the di&s;cernable Exerci&s;e of it; for by &s;ome Means or other; e&s;pecially by Means of remaining Cor|ruption; and &s;ome pre&s;ent powerful Temptation; the gracious Principle may be ob&s;tructed in its Operation; and &s;o may be buried up for the pre&s;ent as it were like Fire covered over with A&s;hes, as not to be di&s;cerned. And as to &s;ome particular Graces or Vertues, there may not be at all Times Occa&s;ion for the Exerci&s;e of them. But unle&s;s there be a prevailing Inclination to exerci&s;e every Grace and Vertue, as there is Occa&s;ion: And if there be not &s;ome Exerci&s;e thereof generally as Occa&s;ions call for it, there is Rea&s;on to fear, that the Principle it &s;elf is wanting:&mdash;for, to keep to the Similitude of the Text; &s;hould we not be ready to conclude there was no Oil, or no good Oil in a Lamp, when upon no Occa&s;ion we could light it, and &s;et it a burning? A Principle of true Grace is powerful, and active: and therefore where|ever it is found, it will have a general Influence upon Mens Lives: And therefore when we &s;ee no &s;uch graci|ous Influence upon Mens Lives, it is ju&s;tly to be feared the Habit it &s;elf is wanting.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="006956_0015_102AC4D3DCD59780">I in&s;i&s;t the more upon this Point, to &s;tave People off from that Self-Flattering, &amp; Deceiving, that is common among Men, whereby they fancy they have true Grace in their Hearts, when there appears nothing of it in their Lives; and &s;o vainly conclude they are ready for Death, and for the Coming of the Son of Man: when alas, they have nothing in Readine&s;s for &s;uch an awful Change; and would be put to as great a Plunge, and meet with the &s;ame dreadful Di&s;appointment as the fooli&s;h Virgins.</P>
<P>I would not therefore have any of you think, that you are prepared, much le&s;s that you are waiting for the Com|ing of our Lord, from a vain Conceit, that there is the Principle of Grace within, when there is no Exerci&s;e of it. <HI>What doth it profit my Brethren, if a Man &s;ay he hath Faith, and hath not Works? Can Faith &s;ave him</HI>? Jam. ii.14. It is not the &s;aying, We have Faith, that will &s;ave us: nor will the having &s;uch a Faith, as is without Works; yea, tho' it &s;hould &s;well up into a pre&s;umptuous Confi|dence or A&s;&s;urance, prepare for the Coming of Chri&s;t. So then, to fini&s;h this Head, and to conclude at pre&s;ent: To have <HI>our Lights burning,</HI> is not to have Grace only ope|rating in the Soul, in the hidden Man of the Heart, that is &s;een only to God: but it is that which operates al&s;o in the Life and Conver&s;ation, and in all our Concerns with Men; &s;o as to appear to Men. Accordingly, our Savi|our directs us in Matth. v.16. <HI>Let your Lights &s;hine before Men, that they may &s;ee your good Works, and glorify your Father which is in Heaven.</HI> And truly Grace in lively vigorous Exerci&s;e cannot be hid long; but it will break forth as the Light. True Grace is true Wi&s;dom, and that <HI>will make a Man's Face to &s;hine,</HI> Eccl. viii.1. Yea, as the &s;ame in&s;pired Preacher tells us, Prov. iv.18. and with which I now conclude; <HI>The Path of the Just is as the &s;hin|ing Light, that &s;hineth more and more unto the perfect Day.</HI></P>

<HEAD>SERMON II.</HEAD>
<P N="3">III. I Now proceed, as I propo&s;ed, <HI>more particularly to de&s;cribe the gracious Saint, that is thus waiting for the Coming of his Lord: Who has his Loins girded about, his Lights burning, and &s;o is like unto them who wait for their Lord, when he &s;hall return from the Wedding.</HI></P>
<P>And here,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>He is &s;trong in the Faith as to his Lord's Coming, at Death, and the Judgment.</HI></P>
<P>As for the Di&s;&s;olution of Nature by Death, all Men, whether good or bad, believe they &s;hall come to it. <HI>The Living know that they &s;hall die,</HI> becau&s;e they &s;ee People dying continually; and all the pa&s;t Generations gone off the Stage. But then, the true Saint not only believes that it is appointed for all Men once to die; but that after Death is the Judgment: A Day <HI>in which God has appointed to judge the World in Righteou&s;ne&s;s by that Man Chri&s;t Je&s;us whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given A&s;&s;urance to all Men, in that he hath rai&s;ed him from the Dead,</HI> Act. xvii.31. And now the watching waiting Chri&s;tian, not only gives his general A&s;&s;ent to the&s;e Things, that he &s;hall die, and that there will be a Re&s;urrection and a Judgment to come, when he, and all Mankind, mu&s;t give an Account of them&s;elves to God; but he has a realizing Sen&s;e of the&s;e Things. He &s;ees the&s;e Things in their Reality, and in their Nearne&s;s. As the watchful Servant, who is waiting for the Coming of his Lord, with his Loins girt and his Lights burning, has not only a general di&s;tant Thought, that his Lord may come &s;ome Time or other; but he has
<PB N="16" REF="006956_0017_102AC4D6F9F927F0">
realizing Apprehen&s;ions, that he will certainly come, and knows not, but that he may this very Minute knock at the Door.&mdash;Thus the true Chri&s;tian, who has his Grace in lively Exerci&s;e, not only realizes Death, as what will mo&s;t certainly come; but as what is ha&s;t'ning on apace to him. He always endeavours to keep up a lively Sen&s;e of the utter uncertainty of the Time when his Lord &s;hall come by Death, whether at Evening, or at Cock-crowing, or in the Morning.&mdash;Is the watchful Chri&s;tian in his Youth, he don't &s;et Death at forty or fifty Years di&s;tance; for he is &s;en&s;ible that youthful Vigour, is no Security again&s;t the Arre&s;ts of Death, becau&s;e Multitudes die in Youth, while their <HI>Brea&s;ts are full of Milk, and their Bones moi&s;tened with Marrow: They come forth like Flowers, and are cut down.</HI> And as he &s;ees &s;ome dying in every Age, he looks upon him&s;elf liable every Day and Hour of his Life to the fa|tal Stroke. And if God &s;pares his Life from Year to Year, even till old Age; yet the watchful Chri&s;tian all that while looks upon him&s;elf in this State of utter Uncer|tainty as to the Time when his Lord &s;hall call for him; and accordingly pa&s;&s;es the whole Time of his &s;ojourning here in the lively realizing Apprehen&s;ion of this, that for aught he knows, Death may be at the Door. The watch|ful waiting Chri&s;tian, in the mid&s;t of Health and Vigour won't <HI>boast &s;o much as of a To-morrow,</HI> becau&s;e <HI>he knows not what a Day may bring forth.</HI>&mdash; In &s;hort, the Chri&s;tian who is in a waiting Po&s;ture, keeps Death &amp; Judgment always in his View, as what are certain, as what are near, and for aught he knows, at the very Door: And if he in his Mind &s;tretches Life to the longe&s;t Period, and thinks of arriving to a great old Age; yet even then he con&s;iders with what &s;wift Wings Time pa&s;&s;es away; and that his Years &s;pend as fa&s;t as Days and Nights can roll over: and that even four&s;core Years, are but as a Tale that is told, they are &s;oon cut off, and he flees away. And the Thought hereof greatly affects him, and has a powerful and happy Influ|ence upon him. For,</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="17" REF="006956_0018_102A7BF6DA6EF7C0">2. <HI>The waiting Chri&s;tian is above all concerned to be pre|pared for the Coming of his Lord.</HI></P>
<P>He views Death and Judgment in their infinite Impor|tance, as well as great Reality. His Heart is deeply affected with the Thoughts of dying, and of appearing before the Judgment-Seat of Chri&s;t, to give Account of all Things done in the Body. Death and Judgment appear awful to him. Every Time he thinks of them (which is very frequent) it gives a Solemnity of Spirit; and fills him with Concern, that he may be prepared for &s;uch an awful Hour as <HI>that,</HI> when he &s;hall pa&s;s out of Time into Eternity, and appear before his Judge, and have his eternal State determined. He is &s;o far from making light of Death, that he ever thinks and &s;peaks of it with Seriou&s;ne&s;s. He con&s;iders it as the grand deci&s;ive Hour, which fixes his State for Eternity, either in Happine&s;s or Mi&s;ery. The great Concern therefore of his whole Life, is to prepare for Death: and he looks upon his Life &s;pent to good Purpo&s;e, only when it is in Preparation for Death and Judgment. His Heart is very &s;en&s;ibly affected with the Thought of dying in his Sins&punc; in as much as then there will be no Hope, or Help for him: that then the Day of Grace will be over, and the Door of Mercy will be &s;hut; and there will remain, nothing but a fearful look|ing for of Judgment, and fiery Indignation to devour him: The Thought of which fills him with Amazement.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, he has the mo&s;t plea&s;ing View of the Happine&s;s of all tho&s;e who are well prepared for their great Change. And Oh! what a plea&s;ing Sen&s;ation has he of tho&s;e Words! Rev. xiv.13. <HI>And I heard a Voice from Heaven, &s;aying to me, write, Ble&s;&s;ed are the Dead who die in the Lord, from henceforth; Yea, &s;aith the Spirit, that they may re&s;t from their Labours, and their Works do follow them.</HI> Accordingly, the De&s;ire of his Soul is, that he may die in the Lord; that he may die the Death of the Righteous. But then, he don't content him&s;elf with the bare De&s;ire of this, like <HI>Balaam</HI> of old; but his Concern is &s;uch, as puts him upon giving all Diligence, that he may be prepared for the awful Change; and that he may be found of his Judge in Peace.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="006956_0019_102AC4DAB64F4A30">Accordingly,</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>He who is waiting for the Coming of his Lord, is above all concerned that he may be found in him, and intere&s;ted in the Redemption he has wrought out for us.</HI></P>
<P>He has a lively Sen&s;e of his own Sin and Corruption; and plainly &s;ees, that if God &s;hould &s;trictly mark his Ini|quity again&s;t him, he &s;hould not be able to &s;tand in the Judgment; and that if he was to an&s;wer per&s;onally at the Bar of God, for his own Defects and Failings, and for his gro&s;&s;er Sins, he mu&s;t be condemned: And that if he be found only with his own imperfect Righteou&s;ne&s;s, he could never be ju&s;tified. Con&s;idering therefore that Death is ha&s;tning, and that Judgment follows upon it; the great Concern of his Soul is, that he may be found in Chri&s;t; becau&s;e there is no Condemnation to them who are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us. His Concern is to receive him as he is offered to him in the Go&s;pel; &s;o as to be intere&s;ted in him, and in his meritorious Obedience and Death, to be cloathed with the white Raiment of his Righteou&s;ne&s;s, that the Shame of his own Nakedne&s;s may not appear. His Con|cern is with the Apo&s;tle, that he may at that Day be found in Chri&s;t; <HI>not having on his own Righteou&s;ne&s;s which is of the Law, but that which is thro' the Faith of Chri&s;t, the Righteou&s;ne&s;s which is of God by Faith,</HI> Phil. iii.9. He has too great a Sen&s;e of his own Sins &amp; Failings, to expect a legal Ju&s;tification before God; and therefore he is con|cerned to obtain it in the Way of the Go&s;pel, even by Faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t; a <HI>Faith that is made perfect by Works.</HI> Accordingly he looks to Chri&s;t for Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Strength, tru&s;ting to be a&s;&s;i&s;ted, pardoned, and accepted only for his Sake&punc; building all his Hopes of Heaven and Happine&s;s, upon the Covenant of Grace, that is e&s;tabli&s;h|ed in his Blood.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>He watches, prays, and strives against every Thing that would render him unfit to meet his Lord.</HI></P>
<P>Having a con&s;tant realizing Sen&s;e of his Lord's Com|ing, he is very much concerned lea&s;t he &s;hould come and
<PB N="19" REF="006956_0020_102AC4DE78799888">
find him unprepared. And he is &s;en&s;ible that Sin is the Thing that mo&s;t of all di&s;qualifies him for meeting Chri&s;t at Death or Judgment. This is therefore what the watch|ful Chri&s;tian is mo&s;t afraid of; and what he is above all concerned to be delivered from. The workings of Sin within him, and the out-breakings of it, in his Words and Actions, are the Burden of his Soul, and what he groans to be delivered from; for he finds how they break in up|on him, and di&s;compo&s;e and ruffle, and &s;o unfit him for the Coming of Chri&s;t. Whenever therefore he feels cor|rupt Nature ri&s;ing, and he him&s;elf giving Way to Pride or Pa&s;&s;ion, or Envy, or Di&s;content, or Worldly-minded|ne&s;s, or Filthine&s;s, he rouzes him&s;elf out of &s;uch a Frame, with the Thought, that the Ma&s;ter is coming, and how &s;hall I look him in the Face with &s;uch filthy Lu&s;ts as the&s;e upon me! He therefore re&s;i&s;ts and oppo&s;es them; and&punc; calling in the Help of the divine Spirit, gets the Ma&s;tery of them: &s;o as to <HI>put off the old Man which is corrupt according to deceitful Lu&s;ts</HI>; and to be dying to Sin every Day.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>The waiting Christian diligently attends every Duty God calls him unto, doing whatever his Hands find to do with his Might, con&s;idering there is no Work nor Device, nor Know|ledge, nor Wi&s;dom, in the Grave whither he is going.</HI></P>
<P>The Servant who would be ready for his Lord's Com|ing, con&s;iders what his Lord has given him to do, before he comes and calls him to an Account: and this he &s;ets him&s;elf about immediately, and without any Delay, lea&s;t his Lord &s;hould come before it be done. He don't leave Things to be done next Year or next Month, or &s;o much as till to Morrow, that can as well be done to Day: For, for aught he knows his Soul may be this Night required of him. He is ambitious of being able to &s;ay at the Com|ing of his Lord, in &s;ome good Mea&s;ure as Chri&s;t him&s;elf did, when he was about to leave the World, Joh. xvii.4. <HI>I have glorified thee on Earth, and fini&s;hed the Work which thou gave&s;t me to do.</HI> Accordingly, he con&s;iders what Work God has given him to do, in and by which he
<PB N="20" REF="006956_0021_102AC4E1060D83C8">
might &s;erve and glorify him. That is, he con&s;iders his general and his particular Calling, and the Duties that re&s;ult therefrom; and attends the &s;ame with all Diligence.</P>
<P>Thus the watching waiting Chri&s;tian attends diligently the Duty of his general Calling.&mdash;That is, at he is call|ed to be a Saint, to be a Chri&s;tian, he endeavours to be &s;uch an one. He endeavours, that the Life he lives here in the Fle&s;h, be by the Faith of the Son of God, who loved us and gave him&s;elf for us; and is concerned to live in all Things as the Grace of God teaches him; <HI>which is to live &s;oberly and righteou&s;ly and godly in the pre&s;ent World:</HI> And the Way he takes to make his Calling and Election &s;ure, is to give Diligence to grow in all the Graces and Virtues of the Chri&s;tian Life, adding to Faith, Vertue, to Vertue, Knowledge, Temperance, Patience, Godline&s;s, Brotherly-kindne&s;s, and Charity.</P>
<P>But then, the Chri&s;tian who would be ready for his Lord's Coming, diligently attends the Bu&s;ine&s;s of his par|ticular Calling.&mdash;He is not carried away with &s;uch a mi&s;taken Notion, that he mu&s;t lay a&s;ide his worldly Bu|&s;ine&s;s and Concerns to prepare for Death and Eternity: but rather endeavours to do it after &s;uch a Manner, that may forward rather than ob&s;truct his Preparations for the &s;ame. Accordingly, he will be diligent in his worldly bu&s;ine&s;s; but will take Care not to be too much cumbred therewith. Altho' he &s;ees he mu&s;t have his Head and his Hands in the World, the one to project, and the other to perform the Bu&s;ine&s;s thereof; yet he endeavours as much as po&s;&s;ible to keep his Heart out of it. He endea|vours to do the Bu&s;ine&s;s of his Calling, not from an inor|dinate Love of the World; but from a Sen&s;e of Duty, and in Subordination to his &s;piritual Intere&s;t, and in &s;uch a godly Sort, as to be ready for his Lord's Coming, even altho' he &s;hould be found in his Shop, or in his Field, or in any lawful Bu&s;ine&s;s what&s;oever.</P>
<P>Moreover, the Chri&s;tian who would be always ready and even waiting for the Coming of his Lord, will con&s;ider
<PB N="21" REF="006956_0022_102AC4E3BAF38D80">
the &s;everal Stations &amp; Relations he &s;tands in to his Fellow-Creatures, and the various Duties that re&s;ult therefrom; and is concerned to be con&s;tantly and faithfully di&s;charging the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Thus, if he be a Ruler, he rules in the Fear of God, con&s;idering he him&s;elf, is &s;ubject and accountable to the great Ruler of the Univer&s;e. If he be among the ruled, he &s;ubmits to every Ordinance of Man for the Lord's Sake, leading a quiet and peceable Life in all Godline&s;s and Hone&s;ty.&mdash;Is he a Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel, and the Pa&s;tor of a Flock? out of Love to Chri&s;t, and out of Love to precious Souls, he feeds the Sheep, and feeds the Lambs, with Knowledge and Under&s;tanding, with all Diligence and Faithfulne&s;s, as One who mu&s;t give an Account.&mdash; Or does he belong to the Flock? he will e&s;teem his faithful Mini&s;ter very highly in Love for his Works Sake; will duly attend his Mini&s;trations, and hearken to the Coun&s;els of God that &s;hall be brought to him. And while his Mini&s;ter freely &s;ows to him &s;piritual Things, he will not think it a great Thing if he &s;hall reap or receive of his carnal Things.&mdash; Again, is he an Hou&s;holder? he will walk in his Hou&s;e wi&s;ely and in a perfect Way, maintaining Religion, good Order and Go|vernment in his Family, re&s;olving with <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> and taking Care, that <HI>as for him and his Hou&s;e they will &s;erve the Lord.</HI> Is he a Parent? he is careful to in&s;truct his Children, and <HI>bring them up in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord.</HI> Is he a Child? he <HI>honours his Father and his Mother</HI> &mdash; Is he a Ma&s;ter? he <HI>renders to his Servants that which is ju&s;t and equal, knowing that he al&s;o has a Ma&s;ter in Heaven,</HI> that he expects will quickly call for him.&mdash;Is he a Servant? he obeys his Ma&s;ter in all lawful Things; <HI>not with Eye-&s;ervice as Men plea&s;ers, but in Singlene&s;s of Heart fearing God, and doing all as unto Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Again, is the waiting Chri&s;tian rich in this World? he <HI>don't trust in the&s;e uncertain Riches, but in the living God</HI>; and is <HI>rich in good Works; laying up in Store a good Foun|dation against the Time to come.</HI>&mdash;Is he Poor? he is content, tru&s;ting in God, and ca&s;ting all his Cares upon him; en|deavouring
<PB N="22" REF="006956_0023_102AC4E61DD469E0">
that he may be rich in Faith, and &s;o an Heir of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>Finally, under this Head; Is there any Thing to be &s;aid, te&s;tified, or done by him, nece&s;&s;ary for perpetuating the Memory of Things, or for the Pre&s;ervation of Peace among Brethren, and Neighbours, or for the preventing any Inju&s;tice after his Decea&s;e? he will take effectual Care to have it done without Delay. And be &s;ure the Chri&s;tian that is in a proper waiting Po&s;ture will &s;et his own Hou&s;e, and all his outward Affairs in Order, making &s;uch Di&s;tri|butions and Settlements of his worldly Goods, as he &s;ees nece&s;&s;ary to do Ju&s;tice to his Family &amp; Friends, and to all with whom he is concerned: And won't leave &s;uch an important Affair as that of making his Will, to be done, even when his Lord actually knocks at the Door, and calls him away immediately. &mdash; Thus the watching waiting Chri&s;tian, is for having every Thing done, that his Lord expects or requires &s;hould be done again&s;t his Coming.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>The waiting Chri&s;tian &s;ets more and more loo&s;e from the World, and all Things in it; which he expects &s;peedily to take an everla&s;ting Farewell of.</HI></P>
<P>The realizing Views of Death, Judgment and the World to come, give the Chri&s;tian a lively Sen&s;e of the Vanity of the World, and of all earthly Enjoyments, and begets an holy Indifferency in the Soul to all Things here below.&mdash;He con&s;iders, that whenever the Ma&s;ter &s;hall knock by his Me&s;&s;enger Death, he mu&s;t leave all behind him; and the Places which now know him, &s;hall know him no more: And that he mu&s;t go as naked out of the World, as he came into it. And therefore as the Chri&s;tian is in certain Expectation of this in a little Time, his Affections all cool to the World, and the Things which are in it. If Riches increa&s;e, he don't &s;et his Heart upon them; becau&s;e he con&s;iders they are uncertain at be&s;t; and that in a little Time he mu&s;t certainly leave them. And on the other Hand, if he meets with Poverty, Di&s;appointments and Afflictions in the World, he bears them with Patience, and Contentment, con&s;idering the Time is &s;hort, and that his
<PB N="23" REF="006956_0024_102AC4E86EB1FEA8">
Redemption draweth near.&mdash;In &s;hort, the waiting Chri&s;tian &s;o realizes the Brevity and Uncertainty of humane Life, that he looks upon him&s;elf but as in a &s;ojourning State, travelling thro' this World as fa&s;t as the Wings of Time can carry him; and looks upon his Hou&s;e not as his Home, but only as an Inn, for a Way-faring Man to lodge in, as it were for a Night: And what Conveniences, and Comforts he finds, he accepts them thankfully at the Hands of a kind Providence. And whatever Inconveni|ences or Troubles he meets with, he &s;ubmits quietly to them; hoping in a little Time to get to his Journey's End, to his heavenly Father's Hou&s;e, where he &s;hall meet with all, that he can de&s;ire.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Accordingly the waiting Christian has his Affections more and more &s;et upon God and Chri&s;t, and Things above.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>His Trea&s;ure is in Heaven, and his Heart is there al&s;o: yea, his Conver&s;ation is in Heaven, from <HI>whence he looks for the Saviour, which is Chri&s;t Je&s;us the Lord.</HI> He con&s;i|ders Chri&s;t is coming: And this draws forth his Soul in longing De&s;ires after him; &s;aying with the P&s;almi&s;t, P&s;al. xl.2. <HI>My Soul thirsteth for God, for the living God, when &s;hall I come and appear before him</HI>? Moreover, he thinks of Heaven, and this puts him into an heavenly Frame. He loves to contemplate the Glories of Heaven, and he loves to &s;peak of Heaven, where he hopes to be in a little Time, with all the Saints that are gone before: And this puts him upon labouring more and more after the heavenly Temper. Having the Promi&s;es, and &s;o the realizing Views of this ble&s;&s;ed and glorious State, he is for <HI>clean&s;ing him&s;elf yet more and more from all Filthine&s;s of Fle&s;h and Spirit, perfecting Holine&s;s in the Fear of God.</HI> And the nearer he draws to the heavenly World, the more of Holine&s;s, Humility, Love and Charity, appear in him, &s;o that Heaven &s;eems to be begun in his Soul, and &s;ome Rays of the heavenly Light and Glory begin to dawn upon him.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="006956_0025_102AC4EAB4B3B300">Thus I have given you &s;ome De&s;cription of the Saint who has his <HI>Loins girded,</HI> his <HI>Lights burning</HI>; and is as a Man that <HI>waiteth</HI> for the Coming of his Lord.</P>
<P N="4">IV. I now proceed, as I propo&s;ed, briefly to &s;et forth the <HI>Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of that Servant who is in &s;uch a watching waiting Frame for the Coming of his Lord.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ble&s;&s;ed is that Servant whom his Lord when he cometh &s;hall find watching.</HI> And &s;urely of all the Men in the World, the&s;e are the ble&s;&s;ed Men: And to &s;et forth the Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of &s;uch, let me &s;ay,&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Such are in high Favour with God.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e are the ble&s;&s;ed Ones, who&s;e Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions are for|given, and who&s;e Sins are done away in the Blood of Chri&s;t; &s;o that they are ju&s;tified freely by God's Grace, thro' the Redemption there is in him: And they are ac|cepted in the dearly beloved Son of God. God the Father is their Friend &amp; Father: Je&s;us Chri&s;t is their Redeemer and Saviour: and the Holy Gho&s;t is their Sanctifier, Guide and Comforter. But then, as I am &s;peaking, not only of true Chri&s;tians in general (of which this is their happy State) but of fir&s;t-rate Chri&s;tians more e&s;pecially, even of &s;uch, who in&s;tead of &s;lumbring and &s;leeping, as even the wi&s;e Virgins did; are watching and waiting for their Lord's Coming: So the&s;e, we may con&s;ider as intitled to &s;ome di&s;tingui&s;hing Marks of Favour. The&s;e are the Servants of the mo&s;t high God, that he delights to honour. The&s;e are his Jewels, and his Trea&s;ure: The&s;e are the Saints in the Earth and the excellent Ones, in whom is his De|light. And God oftentimes confers many Marks of his &s;pecial Favour upon them in this Life, if not always in Temporals, yet in &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings: <HI>They have Life,</HI> &s;piritual Life: yea, <HI>they have it more abundantly,</HI> Joh. x.10.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are &s;uch watching waiting Chri&s;tians, as they are in the mo&s;t de&s;irable Frame to live in, let it be never &s;o long.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="006956_0026_102AC4EE565D43F8">It may &s;eem a Paradox to &s;ome, to tell them it is a ble&s;&s;ed Thing to be always tho'tful of Death, and a ble&s;&s;ed State, and to be con&s;tantly looking and waiting for that great Change. Some Per&s;ons are &s;o far from thinking it a ble&s;&s;ed State, that they look upon it as a very unea&s;y Po&s;ture to be in, &amp; &s;trive all they can, by Company, Diver&s;ions, or Bu&s;i|ne&s;s, to croud &s;uch gloomy melancholy Thoughts out of their Minds. And as to &s;ome, it is a con&s;tant Burden upon their Spirits; and the &s;ervile Fear hereof takes away all the Comforts of Life. Hence we read, Heb. ii.15. of tho&s;e, <HI>who thro' Fear of Death, were all their Life-time &s;ubject to Bondage.</HI> But he who will &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider of the Matter, will find that the Thoughts of Death, and being in a wachful Frame, getting ready for the Coming of Chri&s;t, is the mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed Frame we can be in, during the whole Cour&s;e of Life, &s;tretched out to the longe&s;t Pe|riod. If a Man &s;hould live Three&s;core Years and ten, yea, if by Rea&s;on of Strength, he &s;hould attain to Four|&s;core Years; yet the mo&s;t de&s;ireable Way of Living for that Man from his Youth-up, would be to have <HI>his Loins girded, and his Lights burning, and he as one waiting for the Coming of his Lord</HI>; and to be in Readine&s;s for him, as if he was actually at the Door. Never does a Man live to &s;o good Purpo&s;e. as when he is in actual as well as habitual Readine&s;s for the Coming of Chri&s;t. And Oh! what a ble&s;&s;ed Frame would People be in, did they live always in the near Views of Death, Judgment, and Eter|nity! And he who lives in the neare&s;t &amp; mo&s;t realizing Views hereof, is the mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed Man, as he is in the mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed Way of living. For,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>He lives mo&s;t to the Glory of God.</HI></P>
<P>He walks the clo&s;e&s;t with God, and lives the neare&s;t to him. He has the mo&s;t tender Concern for his Honour, and the Intere&s;t of Chri&s;t, and is mo&s;t careful to live up to his Chri&s;tian Character. Such Men who are in a watching waiting Po&s;ture, are the Men who&s;e Con&s;ciences are tender, and are very fearful of every Thing that is offen&s;ive to God, or would bring Di&s;honour to his Name:
<PB N="26" REF="006956_0027_102AC4EFD933C840">
They live the mo&s;t remote from Sin of any; and mo&s;t careful to ob&s;erve the divine Precepts; yea, and to a|bound in the Fruits of Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Holine&s;s, <HI>which are by Je&s;us Christ to the Prai&s;e and Glory of God.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Such Men live more to the Good and Benefit of others.</HI></P>
<P>According to the near and realizing Views Men have of the Coming of Chri&s;t, will their Tempers towards one another be corrected. How does Pride and Envy, Wrath and Hatred &s;ub&s;ide, and Clamour &amp; Evil-&s;peaking grow &s;ilent, when Chri&s;t our Lord by the Me&s;&s;enger of Death appears to be at the Door? And how does Love and Good-will to all Men begin to ri&s;e and glow in the Hearts of Saints, when they by &s;ome evident Tokens &s;ee Death ha&s;tning upon them? And what a forgiving, and a&s;king Forgivene&s;s? And what a Care to repair every Injury they have done, and to give all Chri&s;tian Satis|faction, where they have given Offence; when in the near Views of Death and Judgment? Which &s;hews, that if Chri&s;tians were always in &s;uch a waiting Po&s;ture, they would live more up to the Chri&s;tian Law of Love to one another. Then Chri&s;tians would have a &s;tricter Regard to Truth and Ju&s;tice in all their Concerns one with ano|ther, and abound in all Acts of Kindne&s;s and Charity to the proper Objects thereof; and endeavour to be of all the Benefit to Mankind they can, by their Coun&s;els and In&s;tructions, and Prayers, and every kind Office. And in &s;hort, will at &s;uch a Time exhibit a bright Example of all Chri&s;tian Graces and Vertues; and &s;et forth the Beau|ties and Glories of Religion, &s;o as to recommend the &s;ame to the E&s;teem and Choice of others. When does Religion appear &s;o amiable and excellent, as in a Servant waiting for the Coming of his Lord, full of Faith, full of Love to God, and Charity to Men, &amp; with an Heart emptied of the World; but full of God and Chri&s;t, full of Heaven, and heavenly Conver&s;ation: And at the &s;ame Time acting with Dili|gence, Care and Fidelity in every Station and Relation of Life? In&s;omuch that if it was not for the horrible Cor|ruptions &amp; Prejudices of Mens Hearts again&s;t the true
<PB N="27" REF="006956_0028_102AC4F36423C520">
Religion of Chri&s;t, every one would be enamoured by his Example. Chri&s;tians in a truly watching &amp; waiting Frame, will &s;o <HI>cau&s;e their Light to &s;hine before Men, that others &s;eeing their good Works, will be &s;trongly induced to glo|rify our Father which is in Heaven.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Such a watching waiting Frame is much for their own Peace and Comfort.</HI></P>
<P>The Loins girded about, and the Lights burning, what is it, but Grace in the &s;everal Branches of it, in lively Exerci&s;e? And &s;urely there is nothing that affords &s;uch true Peace, &s;uch real Plea&s;ure, and &s;olid Satisfaction to the Soul, as this. <HI>Her Ways are Ways of Plea&s;antne&s;s, and all her Paths are Peace. She is a Tree of Life to them that lay hold upon her, and happy is every one that retaineth her,</HI> Prov. iii.17, 18. Whatever the vain, carnal, thoughtle&s;s World may think of it; yet it is certain, that no Men do &s;o ef|fectually con&s;ult their own Peace and Comfort in this World, as they who are in a watching waiting Frame for the Coming of Chri&s;t, and have every Thing ready for his mo&s;t &s;udden Appearance. When does the Man live &s;o near to God; when does he live &s;o like to God, or en|joy &s;uch Communion with him, as when Faith, and Hope, and Charity, are drawn forth into lively Exerci&s;e? More|over in &s;uch a Way, the Chri&s;tian is mo&s;t likely to &s;ee God's reconciled Face, and to enjoy the Evidences of his Love; Yea, and to walk up &amp; down in the Light of his Countenance, <HI>which puts more Gladne&s;s in the Heart, than when Corn and Wine and Oil are increa&s;ed.</HI> P&s;al. iv.6, 7.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Such watching waiting Servants are ble&s;&s;ed as they are in the Way to a peaceable and quiet, and &s;ometimes to a joy|ful Death.</HI></P>
<P>The Saint by realizing Death, by bringing it near and preparing for it; gets at length reconciled to it: &s;o that the Terror of it vani&s;hes: for as to all &s;uch, the Sting of Death, which is Sin, is taken away; and being thus di&s;armed, it cea&s;es to terrify them. The&s;e watching Chri&s;tians are the perfect, and the Upright in the Earth:
<PB N="28" REF="006956_0029_102AC4F5EB1D7DA8">
and <HI>mark the perfect Man, and behold the Upright, for the End of that Man is Peace,</HI> P&s;al. xxxvii.37. Chri&s;tians, who are waiting and in actual Readine&s;s for the Coming of Chri&s;t, when he knocks at the Door, they will not be &s;urprized, nor put into any hurrying Confu&s;ion; but will with all Calmne&s;s receive the Me&s;&s;age. Such are willing to wait all the Days of their appointed Time till their Change &s;hall come: But when it actually comes, they are ready to &s;ay with good <HI>Simeon</HI> of old, <HI>Now, Lord, lette&s;t thou thy Servant depart in Peace, according to thy Word, for mine Eyes have &s;een thy Salvation,</HI> Luk. xxix.29, 30. Ac|cordingly, &s;uch are enabled with an holy Serenity, as well as Stedfa&s;tne&s;s of Faith, to commend their Spirits into the Hands of God who gave them; and into the Hands of Chri&s;t, who redeems and &s;aves them, &s;aying with holy <HI>Stephen, Lord Je&s;us receive my Spirit.</HI> Yea, &s;ometimes at the near Approach of Death, they are filled with Joy, and are enabled in holy Triumph to &s;ay, with the Apo&s;tle, 1 <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> 55, 56, 57. <HI>O Death, where is thy Sting! O Grave, where is thy Victory! the Sting of Death is Sin, and the Strength of Sin is the Law; but Thanks be to God that giveth us the Victory thro' our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Such are ble&s;&s;ed as they are in the Way not only of being received to Heaven; but of receiving distingui&s;hing Marks of Honour from their Lord.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are tho&s;e Servants whom the Lord when he cometh &s;hall find watching: Verily, I &s;ay unto you, that he &s;hall gird him&s;elf, and make them &s;et down at Meat and will come forth and &s;erve them.</HI> As my Text goes on. What a wonder|ful, and even a&s;honi&s;hing Repre&s;entation is this of the conde&s;cending Favour of Chri&s;t, and of the very di&s;tin|gui&s;hing Honour he will do to &s;uch watchful waiting Chri&s;tians! How &s;urprizing would it be to a faithful humble Servant, to &s;ee his Ma&s;ter upon his coming home, &s;o plea&s;ed with the Faithfulne&s;s and Care of his Servant, in having all Things in &s;uch Readine&s;s again&s;t his coming; as to gird him&s;elf, his Cloaths about him, and cau&s;e his Servant to &s;it down to Meat, and he the Ma&s;ter, to come
<PB N="29" REF="006956_0030_102AC4F90CF87AF8">
forth and &s;erve him, and wait upon him? And yet, by &s;uch a Similitude, our ble&s;&s;ed Lord is plea&s;ed to repre&s;ent the di&s;tingui&s;hing Favour he will &s;hew to &s;uch Servants, &s;uch Chri&s;tians, as are in all Readine&s;s for his Coming. All true Chri&s;tians &s;hall be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the re&s;t of the World at Death: For their Souls &s;hall no &s;ooner leave their Bodies&punc; than they &s;hall be conducted by Angels to <HI>Abraham</HI>'s Bo&s;om, to the Paradice of God. And altho' their Bodies, like the Bodies of other Men, &s;hall lie down in the Grave and &s;ee Corruption; yet here is the ble&s;&s;ed Difference, that while others &s;hall <HI>ri&s;e to Shame and ever|lasting Contempt,</HI> the&s;e <HI>&s;hall ri&s;e to Life,</HI> glorious and im|mortal: their <HI>Bodies fa&s;hioned like unto Christ's glorious Body.</HI> And how ble&s;&s;ed will they be at the Judgment, when Chri&s;t their Lord and Judge &s;hall place them at his Right Hand, and then pronounce the ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Euge, Well done, good and faithful Servant,</HI> upon each of them, &s;aying, <HI>Thou hast been faithful in a few Things, I will make thee Ruler over many Things, enter thou into the Joy of thy Lord,</HI> Matth. xxv.21. Ob&s;erve, it is not &s;aid, the Joy of thy Lord enter into you, but <HI>enter ye into the Joy.</HI> The Joy is too great to enter into them, and therefore they are to enter into that, &s;o as to be even &s;wallowed up in an Ocean of Joy. Ac|cordingly, they &s;hall a&s;cend with Chri&s;t to Heaven, and be received to the ble&s;&s;ed Man&s;ions he has there prepared for them: <HI>In who&s;e Pre&s;ence is fulne&s;s of Joys, and at who&s;e Right Hand are Plea&s;ures for evermore.</HI></P>
<P>But as I am &s;peaking more e&s;pecially of fir&s;t Rate Chri&s;tians, who are eminent for their Watchfulne&s;s, and Readine&s;s for the Coming of Chri&s;t; &s;o we may con&s;ider &s;uch, as receiving higher Marks of Favour than other Saints. They &s;hall be not only barely admitted into Hea|ven: but &s;hall have an Entrance mini&s;tred to them <HI>abun|dantly</HI> into the Everla&s;ting Kingdom. They &s;hall not &s;queeze thro' the Gates into the Cele&s;tial City; but they &s;hall have an <HI>open</HI> Entrance, and this mini&s;tred to them <HI>abundantly:</HI> And they, in&s;tead of &s;ome of the lower Seats, &s;hall be advanced to the higher Man&s;ions. Such Di&s;tinction

And then Chri&s;t their Lord, will as it were make them to &s;it down to Meat, and &s;erve them: for he will make mo&s;t free and full Com|munications of him&s;elf, and of the Tokens of his Love unto them, far beyond all that we can de&s;cribe. "For Eye hath not &s;een, nor Ear heard, neither hath it &s;o much as entred into the Heart of Man to conceive, what glorious Things are prepared and laid up for &s;uch:" And &s;o I forbear. And what has been &s;aid, is abundantly &s;ufficient to &s;et forth the Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of every watching and waiting Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>And thus I have fini&s;hed the &s;everal Things I propo&s;ed to con&s;ider in the Text. I have told you, what it is to have your <HI>Loins girded,</HI> and your <HI>Lights burning</HI>; and de&s;cribed the Servant who is thus <HI>waiting for the Coming of his Lord:</HI> And have hinted &s;omething at the Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of &s;uch Servants.

<P>And now, altho' the Subject affords many u&s;eful Heads by Way of Application; yet the Time and Sea&s;on will not allow it: But Oh! may the divine Spirit apply what has been &s;aid to your Hearts and mine: That we may be found among tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ed Servants, whom the Lord when he cometh &s;hall find thus watching.

<P>He had an uncommon vivacity of Spirit, that made him diligent, active and chearful, and ready to every good Work, that God called him unto.&mdash;He was early in the Morning, and early in the Week, at his Studies, and in his Preparations for the Sabbath; in which he made it ap|pear that he gave Attendance to Reading, and Medita|tion, by the &s;ound Doctrines, the wi&s;e Coun&s;els, and the moving Exhortations, with which he entertained you, from Sabbath to Sabbath: In which, he &s;hewed him&s;elf a ready Scribe, well in&s;tructed to the Kingdom of Heaven, bringing out of his Trea&s;ure, like the good Hou&s;holder, Things new and old.</P>
<P>And by his diligent and early Application to his Studies, he redeemed Time for many other u&s;eful Services, both of a private and publick Nature. You your &s;elves, and your Fathers, who are dead and gone, if they were here, could te&s;tify how much Time he has employed, how much Evil he has prevented, and how much Good he has done, by his &s;ea&s;onable, cautious, and wi&s;e Coun&s;els, in your
<PB N="32" REF="006956_0033_102AC4FFE5DC17C8">
Town Affairs; and in your Dome&s;tick and Family Con|cerns.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible he was a great Lover of Peace, and a wi&s;e Coun&s;ellour of Peace: and having an uncom|mon Sagacity and Penetration, &s;aw when the Cloud of Contentions fir&s;t began to ari&s;e, even altho' it was no big|ger than a Man's Hand; and by his wi&s;e pacifick and &s;ea&s;onable Interpo&s;itions, would di&s;per&s;e the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Few Mini&s;ters who have been &s;o much concerned in the various Affairs of their People, as he was in your's; and yet I never heard him taxed of being in the lea&s;t Mea&s;ure a faulty bu&s;y Body in other Mens Matters; for you your &s;elves were &s;o &s;en&s;ible of his Wi&s;dom and Good|ne&s;s, of his Capacity and Readine&s;s to direct and advi&s;e you that, as I have under&s;tood, you &s;eldom or never en|gaged in any important or difficult Affair, without con|&s;ulting him upon it.</P>
<P>And Oh! what a happy Talent had he to prevent Quarrels and Differences among you: to reconcile Diffe|rences when begun; and to root out the Seeds of Di&s;|cord when &s;own among Brethren and Neighbours!</P>
<P>That facetious Temper, and Turn of Wit, which was natural to him, and which altho' &s;ome People of a diffe|rent Make, might think at &s;ome Times, abounded; yet, this mu&s;t be &s;aid, that he made a very good U&s;e of it in general; and that it &s;erved for many valuable Purpo&s;es. How did it &s;erve to &s;catter the Clouds of Melancholy that hung upon People's Spirits, and &s;tir up a plea&s;ant Chearfulne&s;s in them? How did he hereby &s;often Mens Tempers, and correct their ill Humours, and bring the Fretful, the Angry, and the Revengeful, into a calm, peaceable and forgiving Frame?</P>
<P>And as you have had the Character of a peaceable Peo|ple, I believe you will readily grant, that it has been very much owing to the plea&s;ant, prudent, and pacifick Coun|&s;els of your decea&s;ed Pa&s;tor: And if you &s;hould now fall into unhappy Contentions, you will abundantly confirm the &s;ame: But I pray God you may &s;how your &s;elves to be &s;till under the happy Influence of his Coun&s;els, and

Example, by continuing in Peace, and pre&s;erving your Character.</P>
<P>But then, the very u&s;eful Talents of this decea&s;ed Ser|vant of the Lord, were not confined to the Church and Town of <HI>Lexington</HI>; for many Towns and Churches un|der their Difficulties, have been well in&s;tructed, greatly a&s;&s;i&s;ted, and comforted by him. Great Re&s;ort has been to him for Coun&s;el and A&s;&s;i&s;tance; &s;o that <HI>the Care of the</HI> Neighbouring <HI>Churches</HI> in a Manner <HI>came upon him.</HI> But few Mini&s;ters have been &s;o much employed in Eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal Councils as he was; and e&s;pecially in Ordination Councils: For having been the Senior Mini&s;ter of this County for near thirty Years, he has been even as a Bi&s;hop among us; and pre&s;ided in mo&s;t of the Ordina|tion Councils for a great Number of Years. Upon how many he has laid his Hands in the &s;olemn Seperation of them to the Work of the Mini&s;try, I know not; but I under&s;tand, that he him&s;elf, a few Days before his Death, ob&s;erved, that he had given the &s;olemn Charge to twenty one Mini&s;ters; which I believe no Mini&s;ter in this Coun|try be&s;ides has been able to &s;ay.</P>
<P>And he was greatly beloved and honoured by his Bre|thren, &amp; Sons in the Mini&s;try; being a Lover of Ho&s;pitality, and a Lover of good Men, there was great Re&s;ort to his Hou&s;e, by People of various Characters; where they met with hearty Welcomes: and &s;carce ever went away with|out &s;ome in&s;tructive, as well as exhilerating Ob&s;ervations; &s;o that Mini&s;ters of every Age loved his Company, and &s;ought to him for Advice.&mdash;And &s;uch was the Goodne&s;s of God to him, and to his Family, as well as unto you, that altho' he lived to a great Age; yet he did not out-live his U&s;efulne&s;s: For he retained his Spirits, and the Powers of his Mind, with uncommon Vivacity &amp; Vigour, even to the la&s;t.</P>
<P>In le&s;s than a Fortnight before his Death, he gave the &s;olemn Charge to a young Mini&s;ter in a Neighbouring Town,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Rev.

And altho' the Har|bingers of Death took him in his bodily Sleep; and he was little more than waked out of that Sleep by Extremity of Pain, before the Sleep of Death came upon him; yet we tru&s;t he was ready for &s;uch a &s;udden Call; and is gone to receieve the Reward of a faithful Servant; <HI>I heard a Voice from Heaven, &s;aying unto me, write, Ble&s;&s;ed are the Dead which die in the Lord, from henceforth; yea, &s;aith the Spirit, that they may re&s;t from their Labours, and their Works do follow them,</HI> Rev. xiv.13.</P>

Well, remember how you have received and heard, and hold fa&s;t, and repent! Oh! remember the many faith|ful Coun&s;els, and pathetick Exhortations, which he has delivered to you in the Name of the Lord from this De&s;k; as well as in a more private Manner. And may the Thought of his &s;udden Death, and that he can call upon you no more, &s;erve to bring many Things to your Minds, which he has &s;aid to you, and impre&s;s them more deeply upon your Hearts than ever: by which Means, tho' he be dead, it may be &s;aid, that he &s;till &s;peaketh unto you.</P>
<P>And now, &s;ince God has made &s;uch a Breach upon you, you will be ready to &s;ay, What &s;hall we do? and how &s;hall the Breach be repaired? Why, you mu&s;t remem|ber, that he who has made this Breach upon you, is &s;tiled, the <HI>Repairer of Breaches, the Re&s;torer of Paths to dwell in,</HI> I&s;ai. lviii.12.

Well, you have taken up the Body of your decea&s;ed Pa&s;tor, and buried it: and the next Thing is, to go and tell Je&s;us; tell him, that your Pa&s;tor is dead, and that you are as Sheep without a Shepherd; and beg of him to take the Pa&s;toral Care of you, and guide you in every Step towards a future Settle|ment; and that he would pre&s;erve you in Peace, and not &s;uffer you to fall out by the Way.</P>
<P>And here, let me tell you; that hearkening to the Ad|vice of the Text will wonderfully &s;erve to prevent the out-breakings of a contentious Spirit, and pre&s;erve you in Peace. If your Loins be girded, and your Lights burn|ing, and you waiting for the Coming of your Lord, Oh! how would every Thing that is Contentious or Unpeacea|ble in your Tempers, &s;ub&s;ide! Surely, he who con&s;iders
<PB N="38" REF="006956_0039_102AC50ED50CA048">
the Lord is at Hand, will be peaceable and quiet, and ex|erci&s;e a Moderation that &s;hall be known unto all Men.</P>
<P>So that the Advice of the Text is the be&s;t for you: And as it was what Chri&s;t gave to his Di&s;ciples <HI>then</HI>; &s;o he gives to you, and to all of us, <HI>now. What I &s;ay unto you, I &s;ay, unto all, Watch,</HI> Matth. xiii.37. And as it is the Voice of Chri&s;t's Word, &s;o is it of his Providence. The Voice of your decea&s;ed Pa&s;tor's &s;udden Death, to you is, <HI>Be ye al&s;o ready, for in &s;uch an Hour as ye think not, the Son of Man cometh,</HI> Matth. 24.44.</P>
<P>This then is the Exhortation that &s;peaketh to every Age: To tho&s;e who are Young, or in the middle of their Days: But it &s;peaks mo&s;t loudly to tho&s;e who are advanced in Years; to have your Loins girded, your Lights burning, and you all to be in a waiting Po&s;ture for the Coming of your Lord.</P>
<P>The faithful Servant, who is waiting for his Ma&s;ter to come Home; the later it is at Night, the more &s;trongly does he look for him, and the more careful is he to be in actual Readine&s;s for his Coming; that nothing might be lacking, that is nece&s;&s;ary for the due Reception of his Ma&s;ter, whom he expects every Minute to knock at the Door. Well, Decays of Nature, Infirmities of Age, as well as daily Ob&s;ervation, tell you, that your Time is &s;hort, and that Chri&s;t by his Me&s;&s;enger Death, is ju&s;t at Hand. How then does it concern you to be ready, and even waiting for his Coming. And you &s;hould now &s;ee that Nothing be left undone any longer, that is nece&s;&s;ary to be done by you before his Coming. If you have any worldly Con|cerns un&s;ettled, delay them no longer. But above all, &s;ee that you &s;ettle all Affairs &s;o far as po&s;&s;ible between God, and your own Souls. Examine your &s;elves afre&s;h, whe|ther ye be in the Faith; prove and try your &s;elves, over and over again: and cry mightily to God, to &s;earch and try you. And Oh! ye elderly People! &s;ee that your Lights be burning. Labour to &s;hine bright in Faith, in Humility, in Meekne&s;s, in Peaceablene&s;s, in Love and Charity. Let an heavenly Temper, in a heavenly Conver&s;a|tion, &s;hine brighter in you than ever! which may give
<PB N="39" REF="006956_0040_102AC511E5872998">
the be&s;t Evidence to your &s;elves, and to others, that you are really going to that ble&s;&s;ed Place.</P>
<P>And now, to move Young and Old, and People of every Age, to be thus really, habitually, and actually rea|dy for the Coming, the &s;udden Coming of Chri&s;t, I think I have &s;aid enough: And I will only add by Way of Re|collection.</P>
<P>That our Lord will certainly come &s;ooner or later, to every one of us; and it is of infinite Importance to be rea|dy for his Coming, our eternal Salvation depends upon it. If we be ready when Chri&s;t comes, we &s;hall enter with him into the Marriage Chamber, and &s;hall be for|ever with the Lord: But if not ready at that Time, we are undone to all Eternity. <HI>When once the Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e is ri&s;en up, and hath &s;hut to the Door, and ye begin to &s;tand without and to knock at the Door, &s;aying, Lord, Lord, open unto us: he &s;hall an&s;wer and &s;ay unto you, I know you not whence ye are,</HI> Luk. xiii.25. Well, none of us can tell how &s;oon or &s;uddenly he may come to us. But if he &s;hould tarry never &s;o long, let me tell you, that we can never live to &s;o good Purpo&s;e, as when in actual Readi|ne&s;s for the Coming of the Son of Man. It is then, my Brethren, that we live mo&s;t to the Glory of God, to the Honour of Chri&s;t, to the Intere&s;t of Religion, and to the Safety, Peace, and Comfort of our own Souls. &mdash; More|over, this is the Way to prevent our being &s;urprized at the Approach of Death; and is the mo&s;t likely Way to enjoy a ble&s;&s;ed Calm, yea, and an holy Joy in <HI>that</HI> awful Hour.</P>
<P>Finally, This is the Way to be commended, and abun|dantly rewarded by our Lord and Ma&s;ter, when he com|eth. I conclude all, with his own gracious Words, Matth. xxiv.46. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed is that Servant whom his Lord when he cometh &s;hall find &s;o doing.</HI> And &vers;. 38. of the Context. <HI>And if he &s;hall come in the &s;econd Watch; or come in the third Watch, and find them &s;o, ble&s;&s;ed are tho&s;e Servants.</HI></P>
