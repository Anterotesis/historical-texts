<Q>I therefore, Pri&s;oner of the Lord, be&s;eech you, that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called: with all lowline&s;s and meekne&s;s, with long &s;uffering, forbearing one another in love. Endeavouring to keep the unity of the &s;pirit in the bond of peace. There is one body, and one &s;pirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling; One Lord, one faith, one bapti&s;m: One God and Father of all: who is above all, and through all, and in you all.</Q>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ephe&s;. iv. 1&mdash;6.</NOTE>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE words, or nearly the&s;e, were the expre&s;&s;ions of one of the Apo&s;tles, which have taken hold of my mind &s;ince I la&s;t &s;at down, and they have brought with them the remembrance of the unwearied labours of the pri|mitive believers for the pre&s;ervation of the unity of &s;pirit in the bond of peace; that there might be no rents or &s;chi&s;ms found among us, and that being called with the &s;ame hope as they were called, we all might be found one in him in whom they have believed. And I believe, my friends, that it ought to be the concern of every Go&s;pel Mini&s;ter this day. Indeed I can &s;ay when my mind is mo&s;t encoura|ged with hopes; the mo&s;t ardent de&s;ire that I feel is, that notwith&s;tanding there have many divi&s;ions taken place, yet the Lord may again &s;o reveal him&s;elf to his profe&s;&s;ing vi&s;i|ble Church, as to bring us all back into Unity of Spirit in the bonds of un&s;peakable peace. And I have no doubt at all in my mind, but that every jot and tittle of the pro|phetic declaration of the Lord's Servant will in due time be fulfilled; that the Church will at length be one, and her name one; they will all &s;peak the &s;ame language, and the watchmen will all &s;ee eye to eye.</P>
<P>And it may, my friends, be brought about by a variety of circum&s;tances, unfathomable to human wi&s;dom; for in|deed all human wi&s;dom is confounded in &s;earching the things of God. But the glorious di&s;pen&s;ation wherein we
<PB N="4" REF="032807_0003_0FF529174874B028">
live, whenever and wherever it is &s;ubmitted to, produces the &s;ame effect as it did in the beginning, it confounds the wi&s;dom of the wi&s;e; it brings to nought the under&s;tanding of the prudent; &s;o that no fle&s;h &s;hall glory in the Lord's pre&s;ence; that no man might &s;ay that others teach him; but that, by God's holy &s;pirit, he was enabled to &s;earch the deep things of the my&s;tery of his glorious kingdom.</P>
<P>This is my faith; and it remains to be very evidently &s;o. Human wi&s;dom is &s;ufficient in many re&s;pect for our ac|commodations through this temporary abode; it may keep us in &s;ome degree of rectitude; and among&s;t men it may al&s;o conduce greatly to the happine&s;s of individuals; and if clo&s;ely attended to, it may be of &s;ervice to nations and kingdoms. But when we &s;peak of it, as fathoming the everla&s;ting my&s;tery of God's kingdom, I believe we &s;hall always be &s;hort.</P>
<P>It is not&mdash;it cannot be, that through the fallen wi&s;dom of man, he can take in the knowledge of things divine and &s;piritual. It was not &s;o in the primitive Church, though Paul was a great man, who was brought up at the feet of Gamaliel; and was &s;kilful in all the learning of his times; it was not this learning that made him a mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel; for by this, and while he continued merely &s;ubject to, and under the dominion of this wi&s;dom, he was a per&s;ecutor of tho&s;e that preached, and lived in the faith, as it is in Je&s;us Chri&s;t. And what made him a mi|ni&s;ter then? Why; when it plea&s;ed GOD, &s;aid he, in re|vealing his Son, Je&s;us Chri&s;t, he was not di&s;obedient, he was not gain&s;aying to the will of God; but when he believ|ed him&s;elf called in this manner, he went forth, but not with the enticing words of man's wi&s;dom; but in the fool|i&s;hne&s;s of the Cro&s;s. For though he was a great and learned man, he was fir&s;t, before he could be a great man in the promoting of the truth of the go&s;pel upon earth, he was fir&s;t to be reduced, he was fir&s;t alarmed; and the fir&s;t le&s;&s;on which all ought to learn is, If any man will be wi&s;e, let
<PB N="5" REF="032807_0004_0FF528E4B05590D0">
him fir&s;t become a fool. If any man believe, or &s;ay, that he knows any thing, he knows nothing as he ought to know; for &s;o &s;ays the Apo&s;tle.</P>
<P>Now, my friends, it may appear very extraordinary doctrine, at this time of day, but it was &s;uch as the apo&s;tles preached, &s;uch as they had approved, and by means of which they obtained the mini&s;try of reconciliation, which they had received, and fir&s;t were taught; that no man could know of the things that God had &s;ent, but by the &s;pirit of God, who revealed it to them; this was the foundation of their learning in the School of Chri&s;t, and <HI>other foundation can no man lay than that which has been already laid.</HI> This I am per&s;uaded of in my own mind, that we mu&s;t all, not only the mini&s;ters, but all tho&s;e that would have a part in Chri&s;t, that would indeed enjoy an inheritance with him &mdash;they mu&s;t all be taught of him and learn of him; they mu&s;t lean upon his arm, the glorious and ble&s;&s;ed deliverer of his people; they mu&s;t have their exalted imaginations ca&s;t down; they mu&s;t know and feel the power of his word, to bring them into humility, that they may be taught of him. And I believe there is an a&s;&s;ent to the truth of this in many &s;olid &s;eeking minds that are now pre&s;ent. Though human learning and &s;cience in it&s;elf, when properly applied for the purpo&s;es which it is fitted and de&s;igned for, are by no means to be de&s;pi&s;ed; nay when tho&s;e who are qualified with what is called a liberal education, are, by the influence of the &s;pirit of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, brought down into a true Chri&s;tian &s;tate, they may be eminently qualified for the promoting of truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s in their day. So that I would not have you mi&s;take. We make a di&s;tinc|tion it is true: but when the Lord unites them, when he lays his hand upon tho&s;e that have many advantages in the world, he may make them greater in&s;truments in his hand. But I may al&s;o &s;ay, that &s;ome of the greate&s;t ornaments that ever I have known in the church of Chri&s;t, who I believe were qualified for the preaching of the go&s;pel in the de||mon&s;tration
<PB N="6" REF="032807_0005_0FF528F34A3EF490">
of the &s;pirit and of power, have been even among tho&s;e that have had little advantages of this kind. As it was in the beginning, the &s;ame eternal power reigns; the God that commanded light to &s;hine out of darkne&s;s having &s;hone in their hearts, they dwelled and abode in tho&s;e vocations wherewith they were called, and they have become ornaments in the church, and dignified mini|&s;ters of Chri&s;t. But, my friends, what I mo&s;t want is, to &s;ee the people brought back again in e&s;&s;ential matters; (I be|lieve that many of all denominations believe in the revela|tion of the &s;pirit of the God of peace) and to in&s;truct them in the way to everla&s;ting peace, and to wait for it, and to re|ceive it. There are many &s;heep, as Chri&s;t &s;aid, who hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me, though they may be little known of the world. "My &s;heep they hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me; and I will give them eternal life, and none &s;hall be able to pluck them out of my hands. My father who gave them to me, is greater than all, and none &s;hall be able to pluck them out of my heavenly father's hands." O! that you my dear fel|low pilgrims and chri&s;tians of every rank, and of every name, may experimentally know that you have need of Chri&s;t, then though you may be hidden from the world, yet the Lord knoweth, the Lord heareth your prayers, the Lord will magnify his power for your redemption and deli|verance; and no other arm can deliver you from the power of death and hell. This I believe: and let us, my friends, be laying a&s;ide all controver&s;ies about tho&s;e things which have &s;o long oppre&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tianity by contention, needle&s;s and unprofitable contention. I think you will unite with me in &s;aying this has been the ca&s;e. O! how much need|le&s;s and unprofitable contention there has been in the church of Chri&s;t, in the profe&s;&s;ing church of Chri&s;t; for if it had been true and &s;olid&mdash;the foundation in Chri&s;t&mdash;there would have been no &s;uch contention; this is my faith; they would have been united in the bonds of peace and union for ever; they would have harmonized; the &s;ame divine &s;pirit would
<PB N="7" REF="032807_0006_0FF528D4AC12DE10">
have &s;poken nearly the &s;ame language in all; there would have been no room for contention; there would have been no nece&s;&s;ity for contention, if the Church of Chri&s;t had kept hold of the foundation which God laid in Sion; and if they had remembered the rock upon which he decla|red he would build his Church, there would have been a different appearance. Now I believe the &s;ame divine Lord is offering, in everla&s;ting mercy to all men, to bring them back again into this bond of fellow&s;hip, to put an end to all rents and divi&s;ions, to all contradiction, and per&s;ecutions to the end of the world. And what I de&s;ire very much, is, that all people may have faith in God, and in the revelation of his &s;pirit, &s;o as not to let us depart from the ancient doctrine. It is here the Church of Chri&s;t has been erring; by departing from this ancient doctrine which never was, by all that we can find in the whole New Te&s;tament, de|&s;igned to be changed. There never was to be another way, nor another di&s;pen&s;ation to after ages, than was granted and given to the primitive believers. This I am bold to declare.</P>
<P>There was to be no new way into the &s;heep-fold, but that way Chri&s;t him&s;elf declared. "I am the door into the &s;heep|fold. By me, if any man enter, he &s;hall go in and out and find pa&s;ture." Well then, it is for this we &s;it down and wait in &s;ilence, that we may know the promi&s;es which are yea and amen for ever; that we may know the fulfilling of that which Chri&s;t has promi&s;ed; to be with his church to the end of the world. "Lo I am with you alway&mdash;to the end of the world." And for the fulfilment of this promi&s;e there are many, I am per&s;uaded, that not only wait &s;eriou&s;ly in &s;ilence, but are waiting and meditating upon God, and that be of the &s;ame opinion that I am, it being the way, the mo&s;t effectual way, to be taught of this glorious my&s;te|ry, which God, in the riches of his mercy, teaches to all tho&s;e that love him. But men are carried away too much with practices they have been long accu&s;tomed to; we
<PB N="8" REF="032807_0007_0FF528A68FC67B90">
are more filled with prejudices; and we have a great deal le&s;s charity about us than &s;ome would &s;uppo&s;e them|&s;elves to have. We do not judge with that candour and impartiality we ought; nor think of things even of the highe&s;t importance as we ought to do; as wi&s;e men and wi&s;e women, as heirs of immortality and eternal life. Now I believe here is a large number pre&s;ent, who really are en|quiring after the truth, and who are &s;olicitous that they may know the truth and be e&s;tabli&s;hed in it, more than they are to be of any names or forms.</P>
<P>Well, I believe there are tho&s;e who are God's favourite children, under a variety of forms and ob&s;ervations, that I for my own part feel by no means to be e&s;&s;entially nece&s;|&s;ary to believe of any importance, nor po&s;itively com|manded to be continued. For when the &s;oul is in love with God, has found the living and eternal &s;ub&s;tance of all the &s;hadows, and all the figures that ever were in the world, it has no need of elementary things; why, my friends, there were many types and figures in former di&s;|pen&s;ations that were commanded for a time, and they are &s;aid to be a &s;choolma&s;ter to bring to Chri&s;t, who nailed the hand-writing of ordinances to the Cro&s;s.</P>
<P>But let every man be per&s;uaded in his own mind; let every man attend to the light of Chri&s;t in his con&s;cience; and follow the dictates of it fully and faithfully. If thou believe&s;t with all thine heart that it is thy duty in the &s;ight of GOD to be plunged into water in the name of the Father, Son and holy Gho&s;t, according to thy faith &s;o be it to thee, let no man condemn thee. Neverthele&s;s, I believe that when the &s;ub&s;tance of all types is fully found and felt, when he reigns in his kingdom of the heart, when he &s;eats him|&s;elf there, and when we have to partake of that bread which came down from heaven, we have no need of elementary things; for that is &s;ufficient for the &s;oul to nouri&s;h it up to eternal life.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="032807_0008_0FF528FB30EECF48">There were in the beginning many of the primitive be|lievers who continued for a &s;ea&s;on in abundance of ob&s;er|vations; they were even loth to renounce the di&s;pen&s;ations that were pa&s;&s;ed away by the coming of Chri&s;t; and even when Chri&s;t's Kingdom was come into the hearts of them that received it, and when he had fini&s;hed his work his Father had given him to do, and brought in the glorious di&s;pen&s;ation, by which men might draw nigh to God; even then, there were &s;ome of the Apo&s;tles that thought it was nece&s;&s;ary to u&s;e circumci&s;ion; they could not leave off education, they could not leave all at once tho&s;e forms they had been accu&s;tomed to. Not &s;o when it was brought to the Council at Jeru&s;alem; they, according as they felt and under&s;tood matters, rea&s;oned concerning them; they heard one another in the great council of Jeru&s;alem. But what was the re&s;ult of this council? why it clearly came to almo&s;t an end of all the&s;e things; and the day of Chri&s;t, it appeared, was advanced; they did not think the&s;e things nece&s;&s;ary. They &s;aid, it &s;eemeth good to lay upon you no greater burden than that ye ab&s;tain from fornication, from things offered to idols, from things &s;trangled, and from blood; the&s;e were all the council at Jeru&s;alem laid upon believers&mdash;to ob&s;erve no greater burden; and &s;ome of which at this day are not accounted to be any more nece&s;&s;ary than the wa&s;hing of one another's feet was; though our Saviour did do this to manife&s;t though he was Lord of all, he was even in the form of a Servant of all, and conde&s;cended in the depth of humility to wa&s;h his di&s;ciples feet. Here was a great example and pattern. "And he commanded them &s;trictly (if we literally take the expre&s;&s;ions of Scripture,) as I your Lord and Ma&s;ter have wa&s;hed your feet, &s;o wa&s;h ye one another's feet."</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, I believe the&s;e were outward &s;igns, and manife&s;ted Chri&s;t's humility, which he wi&s;hed them to pat|tern after in the whole of their conduct, and tenor of their lives; not confined to wa&s;hing of feet only, but that they
<PB N="10" REF="032807_0009_0FF528B49C8E41C8">
might be &s;ervants one to another. "Let him that will be great among&s;t you be the &s;ervant of all." O that ye, my friends, may &s;et a&s;ide all the contentions concerning the&s;e things; let every man be per&s;uaded in his own mind. But let us come to e&s;&s;ential things, tho&s;e things without which no man can be &s;aved; let us &s;earch more after things that are certain, great, and fundamental points of doctrine, which I believe not only tho&s;e that profe&s;s a faith in Chri&s;t, but that all men, of all nations, of every kingdom, tongue, and people&mdash;people that have the fewe&s;t advantages among&s;t the race of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">, yet they have had this one advantage. The Lord has written his Law in their hearts, he has fulfilled his promi&s;e that he declared to his prophet, "I will write my law in their hearts, I will place it in their inward parts;" &s;o that when we talk of men as of different nations, we &s;hall find that they all agree, if they are men really &s;eeking after the truth, and after that foundation which will bear them out when they come to put off mortality.</P>
<P>All men will acknowledge that the work of righteou&s;ne&s;s is peace, and the effect of righteou&s;ne&s;s, is quietne&s;s to the &s;oul, and a&s;&s;urance for ever. <HI>All men acknowledge this.</HI> I have been among&s;t &s;ome men that have been called the mo&s;t barbarous names, as &s;avages. I have &s;pent a great deal of time with them; aye, <HI>&s;ome months,</HI> and I found they had not been in&s;tructed, they had not had the great advantage that we have. The preaching of the Go&s;pel was little known among&s;t them; yet clear outlines of what the Go&s;|pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t requires, were written upon their hearts; they could &s;ay in terms of equal importance, verily there is a reward to the righteous, verily there is a God that judg|eth in the earth, verily we are accountable beings, verily there is a &s;tate of immortality; there is a ble&s;&s;ed and happy one for tho&s;e that, according to the be&s;t of their knowledge, &s;erve the great Spirit in this world; who do no wrong to their neighbour, who live in God's fear, who lift up their
<PB N="11" REF="032807_0010_0FF528D64509F290">
hearts to him and implore his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The&s;e are the &s;entiments the wild inhabitants of America are taught, whom we are plea&s;ed to call barbarians: &s;o that (I believe) if men would keep to the foundation, if they would not &s;catter hither and thither after a variety of non-e&s;&s;ential things, they would &s;ooner be brought into greater harmony and union. For there is but one GOD over all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all? Aye, may &s;ome &s;ay, is he in us all? Why, there is nothing more con|tinually enforced upon us, in all the Doctrine of the New Te&s;tament than God and Chri&s;t in us the hope of Glory; and I believe this is not a time for tho&s;e who have the benefit of reading the Scriptures to deny this; it is a great benefit, a peculiar advantage which God has favoured us with, who profe&s;s the name of Chri&s;t; it would be a great advantage to &s;ome of you, my young friends, were you more acquainted therewith, if there was more delight in reading the Scriptures than there is in the pre&s;ent generation, and le&s;s delight in reading tho&s;e things that make a je&s;t of hea|ven and hell, of GOD, and all things &s;erious; I believe it would be a great advantage to many of the ri&s;ing youth.</P>
<P>I know that I for many years &s;o abu&s;ed my time in read|ing novels, romances, plays, and a variety of trumpery of this kind, that I had no reli&s;h for the Scriptures; and when I was brought to read the words, they were a &s;ealed book to me; I &s;aw nothing in them, I had no delight in them; I would take them up and lay them down, and knew nothing of their value.&mdash;So it is with many; it it &s;o with an abundance, both in Europe and America; much time is &s;pent upon trifles; upon tho&s;e things that, in&s;tead of giving any real &s;olid enjoyment, only tend to bani&s;h all tho&s;e rational and well-founded plea&s;ures and enjoyments which the Chri&s;tian experiences.</P>
<P>This is my te&s;timony, becau&s;e I <HI>know</HI> what I <HI>&s;ay.</HI> I was for a number of years a &s;lave to them: I know where they led me <HI>to,</HI> and I know where they led me <HI>from.</HI> But
<PB N="12" REF="032807_0011_0FF528BFC5F5D160">
thanks be to God, there is &s;omething which all men may experience, that will &s;et their &s;ouls at re&s;t; that will re|lieve them from an anxiety after every burden of the pa&s;|&s;ing hour.</P>
<P>A man that loves to contemplate, (and it is truly con|&s;i&s;tent with the dignity of a rational being, that is here for a few years, and pre&s;ently makes his exit and is &s;een no more) a man that can devote his lei&s;ure hours, to con|template the nobility of his rank in creation, the maje&s;ty and greatne&s;s of that adorable Being who created all things by the word of his power, and who can contemplate that glorious &s;cene that awaits the righteous, has more real en|joyment than all the plea&s;ures u&s;hered into the world. And this I am per&s;uaded of, that a private &s;ober meditation, and an evening's walk of a wi&s;e man, thus informed, is indeed the highe&s;t gratification that noble and rational beings, as we are, can enjoy. And that in wherein I want you, my young friends, to &s;et out right. In the early part of your youth, Search the Scriptures; they are books of ine&s;timable value. One of the great men of this nation, who &s;ome ages ago was preparing to die, when he came to lay down his head upon his bed of &s;ickne&s;s, and &s;aw the awful hour of death was come&mdash;What were his lamentations and expre&s;&s;ions? Why he &s;aid, O! that I had &s;erved my GOD as faithful as I have &s;erved my king; it would have been better for me now! He had been a great and famous &s;tate&s;man. Now, my friends, this was his expe|rience, and it may not be incompatible with the Chri&s;tian. Another of the &s;ame kind, whom I do not now recollect, but it was another man of eminence, that &s;aid, if he had his time to go over again in this world, he would &s;pend much of it in reading David's P&s;alms and Paul's Epi&s;tles. And I wi&s;h you, my young friends, in this employ. Then you would find for your&s;elves that the doctrine therein contained would lead you to God's kingdom. You would find indeed that God was <HI>nigh</HI> unto you. He is not, "&s;ays
<PB N="13" REF="032807_0012_0FF5291148F04CB0">
Paul, afar off from any one of you, for in him ye move and have your being." This was their con&s;tant te&s;timony. Nay, before the coming of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, they acknow|ledged his divinity. And &s;hall we go back and &s;ay it is no &s;uch thing?&mdash;Did not Socrates and Seneca, and many others, acknowledge the divinity was he that led them, that &s;hewed them that they were immortal, and cau&s;ed them to a&s;pire after tho&s;e things that would recommend them to the notice of God, and to great and everla&s;ting peace? O! my friends, there are a cloud of witne&s;&s;es from genera|tion to generation that the Lord has rai&s;ed up in this man|ner to declare to the people, that He it was, and He it is, who is the true teacher of all wi&s;dom, of all that wi&s;dom which cometh down from him, which is pure, peaceable, gentle, and ea&s;y to be entreated, full of mercy, full of good fruit; and it is by this wi&s;dom that we &s;hould be brought into the harmony that I have been &s;peaking of. O! that men would wait for it, that they would a&s;k for it, and that there were more who practi&s;ed retirement in the world, and more &s;incerity of heart even in our prayers! for what is it to be &s;aying, "Lord, Lord," from the cradle to the grave? If we are not de&s;irous to be taught of him, and to do his will, what will it &s;ignify? Many in the hurry of life do not con&s;ider him &s;ufficiently, but when they are brought to lay down upon a &s;ick bed; O! how changed do things appear, in how different a point of view. I have been be|fore many at death; I have vi&s;ited the chambers of tho&s;e that have been penitent; I have heard their expre&s;&s;ions; many a time have I &s;een the work of the Lord upon them: How it hath changed them! One of the brighte&s;t young men that ever I knew, I may &s;ay, the delight of his ac|quaintance; yea the pride of all gay company, who was the life, or as &s;ome &s;ay, the &s;oul of every place he vi&s;ited; for his gaiety, humour, and wit&mdash;O! the Lord in his wi&s;|dom did not &s;uffer him to remain in this way, but laid his hand upon him; and laid him upon a &s;ick bed, and when he was there, &s;uch was the &s;tate of this bright young man,
<PB N="14" REF="032807_0013_0FF528C15B5102F0">
that, when he was brought to &s;ee that he had not many days to continue in this &s;tage, he required to &s;ee &s;ome whom he thought were Religious, and when he &s;aw them, O! how his heart was tortured! and what were his expre&s;&s;ions? why upon this wi&s;e, "I, (&s;ays he) have &s;een abundance; I know men and things, I have pa&s;&s;ed through and been at different Courts, I have ta&s;ted a great deal of what the world calls enjoyments in this earth; I have been educated in &s;ome religious principles; but I &s;aw that they were too narrow for me, they confined me too much, there was not room and liberty enough for me; I read BOLINGBROKE, HUME, and PAINE, and I had almo&s;t encouraged my&s;elf therein. But now it has plea&s;ed the Lord to bring me upon this bed of &s;ickne&s;s; I know I have a Phy&s;ician, but no medical aid can help me now, my friends." I went to him, I found him wet with tears; he told me his former companions neglected him; and he &s;aid, if they had not neglected me, they would have yield|ed me no comfort; they would have been &s;tings to my con&s;cience, and as daggers to my heart, becau&s;e I have been in their &s;tate. Now, &s;aid he, what would you have me do in this &s;ituation? O, &s;aid he, I want to believe, but I have been &s;o dark, and encouraged the&s;e principles &s;o long, that I cannot believe as I ought to do. Well, this was truly a &s;orrowful and affecting &s;cene to me, and &s;o it would have been to many if they had been pre&s;ent. The Lord, no doubt, is rich in mercy, and I tru&s;t he vi&s;ited his &s;oul, even the la&s;t few days of his life; and to him I com|mit it. I cannot &s;ay that infinite Love did not even at that late hour accept him. But O! my friends, let us, while we have &s;trength and liberty, let us with all our hearts apply them to tho&s;e things which will be &s;omething to lean upon in &s;uch an hour! For this indeed is the end of all Religion, talk of it as long as we may; &s;o to live as not to be afraid to die; that we may &s;o die when it &s;hall plea&s;e the Lord to &s;eparate us from this body that we may live before him for ever!</P>

<HEAD>The &s;econd Di&s;cour&s;e of W. Savery.</HEAD>
<P>There are certain obligations that are the &s;ame in all Na|tions and Countries; and I would not have you believe, my friends, that when I &s;poke of the outward and typical things, &s;uch as wa&s;hing, &s;uch as ab&s;taining from blood and things &s;trangled, which are not ob&s;erved in the pre&s;ent day by a large number of Chri&s;tians, that I meant to cen&s;ure any part of the moral Law. No: I believe it never can be di&s;pen&s;ed with; but the whole of tho&s;e things that the councils of Jeru&s;alem forbad, are forbidden in all nations as an eternal decree. I thought I might &s;o far explain upon this head, as I do not know, my dear friends, when it may plea&s;e the Lord to bring me with you again. I feel my heart bound in affection to many of the Citizens of London, I wi&s;h their everla&s;ting welfare; I &s;eek not you, nor any thing that is yours to my&s;elf; but all men and my own &s;oul al&s;o, to God; that we may with reverence of &s;oul &s;eek him if happily we may find him; that tho&s;e that are convinced by the light of Chri&s;t in their con&s;ciences, of what their duty is to God, may, with child-like &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and obe|dience to his holy will, conform to it in all things; for if it has plea&s;ed God to enlighten thee in any matter or thing, as &s;oon as he is plea&s;ed to &s;hew thee what thou oughte&s;t to do, and thou neglecte&s;t thy duty therein, then thou be|come&s;t condemnable before him; no man will be condemn|ed for that which God hath not &s;hewn him; but I believe it is po&s;&s;ible for men to neglect the means of obtaining the knowledge of the will of God. Not being &s;erious enough, not &s;eeking it in the way it is to be found. Not a&s;king wi&s;|dom of him who gives liberally to all men and upbraideth none. Our all is at &s;take. If I am an enthu&s;ia&s;t in the&s;e things, the Lord pre&s;erve me an enthu&s;ia&s;t to the end of my days. I believe that the whole world, and all the ad|vantages that any can obtain, will be indeed as the &s;malle&s;t du&s;t in the balance again&s;t the &s;alvation of the immortal foul: therefore it is that I am &s;erious, and concerned for my

own &s;oul and for tho&s;e of others. And I believe that if tho&s;e who are convinced of the ways of Truth and Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, if they with &s;implicity of &s;oul acknowledge the truth, and live in the truth of the divine law, they will not only have a gladdening hope of a glorious immortality in the world to come; but they will al&s;o be favoured with an hundred fold of peace and joy in this life. I think I know it from &s;ome degree of experience, I never knew what true and real enjoyment was in the Lord's temporal ble&s;&s;ings, till it plea&s;ed him to touch my heart and bring me to a &s;en&s;e of my &s;tate, and of obedience to him. I am firmly per&s;uaded that the way the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t has ca&s;t up for tho&s;e that will finally be heirs of his kingdom, is neither gloomy, nor improper for a rea&s;onable, &s;en&s;ible, dignify'd mind to walk in; there is liberty enough, there is room enough; we do not want to rob you of any thing; nei|ther did your Redeemer and Saviour, that was truly valuable even in the enjoyment of the pre&s;ent world, not of any tem|poral ble&s;&s;ing which God has granted; the true and &s;olid enjoyment of them is found only by a truly religious mind. O! the glorious liberty there is in the truth as it is in <HI>Je&s;us!</HI> What are all the opinions of men in compari&s;on of it? how trifling, how light, their &s;en&s;ele&s;s contradictions; they are ever changing! There is, my friends, a glorious and ble&s;&s;|ed liberty in the truth as it is in Je&s;us, that I would to God all men might enjoy; that &s;o his Church might once more put on her beautiful garments: that all tho&s;e uncharitable di&s;po&s;itions which are harboured by &s;ome, though I hope in this enlightened day, not by a great many, may be removed; God is doing them away, &s;eeking thus his own work; he is aboli&s;hing tho&s;e things which kept us &s;o long at a di&s;tance &s;ecretly, and will bring them to nought; this is my opini|on; and more and more charity will prevail: let us cheri&s;h, let us with one accord be willing to live in it, and to die in it; then indeed &s;hall we embrace one another as brethren. There will be no &s;uch thing as hurting, or doing one ano|ther an injury: the peaceable kingdom of Je&s;us Chri&s;t our

Saviour, being e&s;tabli&s;hed and &s;et up in the hearts of men, would put an end to WAR, and all the horrors append|ing to it in the world. O! that men might once more embrace one another as brethren, and enjoy the glorious liberty of children of one common family.</P>

<P>I hope it will not le&s;&s;en the Solemnity, which is ma|nife&s;t in this meeting, by expre&s;&s;ing the de&s;ire which attends my mind upon the behalf of vi&s;ited minds that are pre&s;ent; which is, that they may bear in remembrance the declaration of an experienced &s;ervant of Chri&s;t; that, that which is to be known of God, is manife&s;ted in man; for God hath &s;hewed it unto him. Now this, according to my apprehen&s;ion, points to the nece&s;&s;ity of withdrawing our dependance from all inferiour objects, and waiting upon God, that we al&s;o may attain to the experience of being in&s;tructed by him. And the more we become in&s;tructed of him; the more we &s;hall be guarded again&s;t tho&s;e, and looking after tho&s;e, again&s;t whom our ble&s;&s;ed Lord for|merly cautioned his vi&s;ited followers; when he declares that many would come in his name, calling their attention outward; "lo, (&s;ays he) I have told you before, many &s;hould come in my name, and &s;ay, lo here is Chri&s;t: and others, lo there is Chri&s;t: but I &s;ay unto you, Go not forth after them." Here is doctrine, my friends, do not look <HI>out</HI> for that which is to be known <HI>within.</HI> "Go not forth after them;" for, (&s;ays he) "the kingdom of God is with|in you." Now here is a number pre&s;ent, I have no doubt, who are often addre&s;&s;ing him in words, and repeating over and over again, "Thy kingdom come:"&mdash;But where are we, my dear friends, looking for his kingdom? Cannot you believe him who has thus declared, "The Kingdom of God is within you?" It con&s;i&s;ts in the government of his Spirit. And therefore when ye &s;ay, "Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done upon earth, as it is in heaven," are ye &s;incerely
<PB N="18" REF="032807_0017_0FF529580958FD78">
de&s;irous of having your minds and affections brought under the government of his holy Spirit? Do not you remember, when he was about to be taken away from his di&s;ciples and followers, in the time of his outward appearance, where he &s;ays, "If I go not away the comforter will not come; but if I go away, I pray unto the Father, and he &s;hall &s;end another comforter, even the &s;pirit of Truth. And when that &s;pirit &s;hall come, he &s;hall reprove the world of &s;in, and of righteou&s;ne&s;s and of judgment." Now this is what we wait for in our times of retirement, "When he the &s;pirit of truth &s;hall come, he &s;hall bring all things that I have told you to your remembrance; and will lead you and guide you into all truth." Now my dear friends, look at the&s;e things, and bear them in remembrance in your hours of retirement, when &s;eparated one from another. Do not look outward: remember that which is to be known of God is manife&s;ted in man: for there God will reveal it to you in his own way and in his own time. And let your obedience keep pace with your knowledge; for the kingdom of God con&s;i&s;ts not in meats and drinks, and in outward ordinances, but in righteou&s;ne&s;s, and peace, and joy in the Holy Gho&s;t; for the work of righteou&s;ne&s;s is peace, and the effect of it will be at la&s;t quietne&s;s and a&s;&s;urance with God for ever.</P>

<P>THE pre&s;ent is an age of many uncommon events, and the curious ob&s;erver will not be inattentive to what they tend; and indeed many are filled with conjectures where the&s;e things will end. It is a day al&s;o, wherein men of &s;cience have been exceedingly curious in their re|&s;earches; they have brought up &s;ome new and before unheard of things to view: and probably &s;ome of them may be turned to advantage to their country, in ages to come, though they are not now altogether u&s;efully employed in the world.</P>
<P>But I have been thinking, my friends, of one Science worth them all; for if men were even to po&s;&s;e&s;s the power of counting all the luminaries of heaven, and to mea&s;ure the magnitude of all the heavenly bodies, even of tho&s;e that lay beyond the reach of the pre&s;ent ob&s;ervers; if they knew all the hidden arcana of nature, what would it avail, if they were de&s;titute of the knowledge of God and them&s;elves?</P>
<Q>Know ye not your own &s;elves<NOTE PLACE="foot">2 Corinthians, xiii. 5.</NOTE>?</Q>
<P>So &s;aid the Apo&s;tle. A great le&s;&s;on: One of a later time had this reflection upon it,
<Q>"Man know thy&s;elf, enough for man to know."</Q></P>
<P>Now I conceive, my friends, here is a wide field unex|plained by many; and wherein I am convinced the riche&s;t trea&s;ure is to be found; the mo&s;t worthy of all knowledge; viz. the knowledge of God and our&s;elves. Yea "to know Thee the only true God and Je&s;us Chri&s;t whom thou ha&s;t &s;ent, is life eternal." Je&s;us the Son and Sent of GOD. Well, my friends, there is no doubt but that there are a number pre&s;ent, who at times have been employed in this mo&s;t im|portant and &s;erious enquiry. But there are many men who can &s;pend day after day, and year after year, in labour and &s;earch almo&s;t indefatigable, without being weary, in things that concern only this &s;hort and uncertain &s;tate of
<PB N="22" REF="032807_0020_0FF52918E21A2210">
being; who are not patient enough, to devote the &s;ame time, the &s;ame attention, the &s;ame dedication of their fa|culties and powers which God has given them to the mo&s;t important and enriching of all &s;ciences.</P>
<P>And this is, my friends, what I have been lamenting both in my own country and in this. For I believe, as &s;urely as the great Creator and Ruler of the univer&s;e has granted us powers and talents for the mo&s;t glorious and dignified pur|po&s;es, &s;o, I believe, that one day all men will be brought to an account of their &s;teward&s;hip. The infidel in time of health &s;miles at this! "But, (this I acknowledge) though men may live fools, yet fools they cannot die." Men, while they are diverting them&s;elves, in the pa&s;&s;ing enjoyments of the pre&s;ent life, however vain and little, and below the dig|nity of their nature, may be &s;o amu&s;ed, and &s;uffer them &s;o to take up their faculties and powers, that they may never be in a capacity to think and feel &s;ufficiently after the mo&s;t &s;olid and important thing. Certainly, my friends, this is a cau&s;e of &s;orrow to every thinking mind; and I know that it is, and ever mu&s;t be, a cau&s;e of real affliction to every go&s;pel mini&s;ter; who believes in the &s;acred and unchangeable truths which have every confirmation, that rea&s;onable minds could dare to a&s;k, or that was nece&s;&s;ary for the wi&s;e and beneficent GOD to give. (this is my faith) Thus mini&s;ters, I am per&s;uaded, under every name, pro|fe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tianity, mu&s;t behold with &s;orrow their fellow pilgrims travelling towards an endle&s;s eternity; involved in things below, and unfit for tho&s;e that they ought to be employed in, laying up a foundation again&s;t the time to come; that &s;o they may lay hold of eternal Life. For I conceive there are very few, perhaps none at all, that could entertain a belief that they are not immortal.
<Q>"If Man is not immortal, GOD'S unju&s;t,"</Q>
&s;o &s;aid one, a pious writer, "to &s;end him in this world in the condition that we &s;ee him, even in his be&s;t e&s;tate." For verily, as &s;aid one of the ancient Scripture
<PB N="23" REF="032807_0021_0FF528C2F1CE7148">
writers, "Every man in his be&s;t e&s;tate is vanity," take him in what&s;oever condition of life you may. Tho&s;e that are in the enjoyment of &s;o much of this world's goods that they can compa&s;s every plea&s;ure (fal&s;ely &s;o called) that the world and all its auxiliaries can give, know they no moments of &s;adne&s;s? my per&s;ua&s;ion is they have many. A man of <HI>plea&s;ure</HI> is a man of <HI>pain:</HI> this may appear a paradox, but it is no more than true. Tho&s;e that are lovers of plea|&s;ure, more than lovers of God, are in every condition of human life, men of pain. The infirmity of a man's body the &s;pirit of a man can bear, but a wounded &s;pirit who can bear? There are many who can &s;upport with much fortitude and patience, lingering pain of body; they can meet death with &s;ome apparent degree of compo&s;ure and fortitude, provided always that the &s;ting of death be drawn, not el&s;e; if a man is in his rational under&s;tanding. For the common infirmities of a man, the &s;pirit of a man can bear; but a wounded &s;pirit who can bear?</P>
<P>Well, my friends, it is in great mercy that the Lord wounds us: it is not thou that wounde&s;t thy&s;elf. An hou&s;e divided again&s;t it&s;elf can never &s;tand. Do&s;t thou thine own &s;elf condemn thy&s;elf? No: it is as clear as any axiom in Eu|clid; it cannot be, it is impo&s;&s;ible; an hou&s;e divided again&s;t it&s;elf can never &s;tand. What is it that condemns, what is it that di&s;quiets, what is it that un&s;ettles and confu&s;es the mind of tho&s;e that have been guilty of enormous crimes? What is it that cau&s;es the murderer to fly from country to country, and find no re&s;ting place for the &s;ole of his feet; no bed &s;oft enough for him to repo&s;e upon? I &s;ay it is <HI>Con|&s;cience.</HI> What is CONSCIENCE? The voice of GOD, I &s;ay, in thy &s;oul: this is con&s;cience.&mdash;The &s;ame voice that called to Adam, when he had tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the commandment of his Creator; "Adam, where art thou?" Adam was weak enough to conceive he could conceal him&s;elf from Him that had even made the earth, the &s;ea, and the fountains of waters! "Adam, where art thou?" Why be knew that
<PB N="24" REF="032807_0022_0FF528F99C82B8A8">
he had tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the command of God, and he was afraid: "I heard thy voice, and was afraid." Well, &s;o may every &s;inner, great or little; and know this is the cau&s;e of their fears: "I heard thy voice and was afraid." It is in vain, I conceive, for men to talk of the principles of their education; tho&s;e things are as women's tales; they are old as the creation of the world we live in; and will remain, I believe, until the firmament &s;hall be di&s;&s;olved as with fer|vent heat, and earth and all that are therein again di&s;&s;olve. This is my faith: and all the wi&s;e and all the good have borne te&s;timony &s;imilar to this; that have written, and that have &s;poken in the various ages of mankind; they have borne te&s;timony to the Law of God written in their hearts. How futile, how weak for men to talk of divi&s;ions and &s;ub|divi&s;ions in the&s;e things! to &s;peak of natural con&s;cience; and the &s;ame futility in their arguments, in their le&s;&s;ons, and in tho&s;e convul&s;ions that there are when we &s;ee the great, awful and tremendous works of God that appear in the earth; to &s;ay it is Nature!&mdash;</P>
<P>How futile, for men not to look up through nature to na|ture's GOD, to confu&s;e and confound them&s;elves and one another. This is my faith, and I do not want you to re|ceive it any further than it may coincide with the be&s;t light and knowledge which God in his mercy has granted you. I do not want you to pin your faith upon mine. No: we &s;eek not man's &s;ilver, nor gold, nor applau&s;e, nor any thing that is their's: we call not the people together to amu&s;e them with fine words, and fine &s;peeches, but with that phi|lanthrophy which ever ought and ever mu&s;t accompany the mind of a true go&s;pel mini&s;ter; and will induce him (if he has really been benefited by the knowledge of GOD him&s;elf) to de&s;ire with ardour of &s;oul that all men may come to the &s;ame experience. I have rea&s;on to &s;ay, God be thank|ed, for me who was in darkne&s;s as thick as any of my con|temporaries, concerning God, and the things of God, &s;wallowed up in inticing plea&s;ures, and vanities of this life,
<PB N="25" REF="032807_0023_0FF528A4B594F6F8">
as much as many of you, and perhaps mo&s;t of you, and as far from the knowledge of that peace which pa&s;&s;es all natu|ral rea&s;on and under&s;tanding of men, as any could be. Thanks be to God, who is wi&s;e, who never leaves any of us in this &s;tate, without compunction of &s;oul, from &s;ea&s;on to &s;ea&s;on: who follows us in the night revels, who follows us into the halls of licentiou&s;ne&s;s, who follows us in the mid&s;t of our gay career with our companions, and wounds our mo&s;t joyful &s;cenes&mdash;this I am clear of: &s;o that in the mid&s;t of laughter I can freely acknowledge, I have been &s;till &s;ad &mdash;becau&s;e my heart was &s;ad. "I heard thy voice and was afraid."</P>
<P>Well, my friends, there is a great deal &s;aid about religion in the world; men have (&s;hall I &s;ay) hewn out a variety of &s;y&s;tems, that have been &s;trong in their inventions, and various in the powers which God has given them, to rea&s;on upon, each one upon their own &s;y&s;tem. It is not &s;y&s;tems nor opinions&mdash;It is neither high church nor low church that I am &s;peaking about now. There is but one true and living church, the whole world over. Men may call them&s;elves what they plea&s;e: the world calls me a <HI>Quaker</HI>&mdash;and thee a <HI>Di&s;&s;enter</HI> in another form&mdash;and thee a member of the <HI>E&s;tabli&s;hed Church</HI>&mdash;But what is all this? My friends, the&s;e are names, they are di&s;tinctions among&s;t men: but are they di&s;tinctions with God? Does he know <HI>high</HI> church, and <HI>low</HI> church? Does he de&s;cend to inquire whether thou art a <HI>methodi&s;t</HI> or a <HI>pre&s;byterian,</HI> thou a <HI>bapti&s;t,</HI> thou a <HI>roman catholic?</HI> No: But is thy <HI>heart</HI> right? Art thou &s;incere in thy de&s;ires to know him and to &s;erve him? This is the great point: to know him, and to know thine own&s;elf; the &s;ituation in which he has placed thee, who is the Author of thy being; the rea&s;on he has given to thee that <HI>Being,</HI> and the glory which he propo&s;es to crown it with, if thou wilt, with &s;implicity of heart, live in his coun&s;el, and in his fear, and avoid tho&s;e things that are repugnant to God's purity, with
<PB N="26" REF="032807_0024_0FF5293EA4892A28">
a pure and truly enlightened mind. Men have too long been to&s;&s;ed about tho&s;e things, I am per&s;uaded of it; and a day, I am glad to hope, is &s;peedily advancing, when there &s;hall be little heard of it in the world. The &s;word of per|&s;ecution is in a great mea&s;ure (through the Lord's mercy) &s;taid; and yet there is room for it to be more clo&s;ely &s;heathed. I believe men are coming back to think for them&s;elves; to feel for them&s;elves as they ought to do; to inquire after the truth; not of leaders of &s;ects or parties, and of men ap|pointed for to lead them in a certain way&mdash;but to inquire after it wi&s;ely&mdash;independant one upon another&mdash;and de|pendant only, in this point, upon God, the fountain of all wi&s;dom and knowledge. (This is my belief.)</P>
<P>So that, my friends, as I &s;aid before, I am not come among you to gather you to <HI>my</HI> party; but that all men may become &s;o inqui&s;itive for them&s;elves, that they may be joined to GOD and CHRIST in their part. For there are, I am per&s;uaded in my own experience, men that I have found both in this country and in my own country, (where all men are free to po&s;&s;e&s;s and believe whatever they plea&s;e, as to opinions of religion) I &s;ay there are tho&s;e among the various profe&s;&s;ors, whom I can embrace as children of one great and univer&s;al Parent, in the truth, as it is in Je&s;us.</P>
<P>So that it cannot be&mdash;it would be contrary to charity that I &s;hould &s;eem to be bigoted to any party upon earth; but I want that all men &s;hould &s;earch and &s;ee for them|&s;elves! "Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh unto you as he did in the primitive ages to the primitive be|lievers. He was known of the patriarchs; He was known of the prophets; He was known of the apo&s;tles; they knew that He was in them; they knew His power created all things; they knew He filled all things; "He is not far (&s;ays the learned Paul) from any of you, for in Him ye live, move, and have your being." But He perceived the learned Athenians, who were exceeding wi&s;e in their day, he per|ceived that when he pa&s;&s;ed by their altar how dark they
<PB N="27" REF="032807_0025_0FF528BE2C44BF98">
were in the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential of all &s;ciences. "For (&s;ays he) I perceive that in all things ye are too &s;uper&s;titious:" for as I pa&s;&s;ed by your altar, I &s;aw this in&s;cription upon it&mdash; "TO THE UNKNOWN GOD"&mdash;and "that God, whom ye ignorantly wor&s;hip, declare I unto you." This was the bu&s;ine&s;s of the apo&s;tle among&s;t both Jew and Gentile; they were not a&s;hamed to confe&s;s their opinion, yea even in the Athenian courts among the great philo&s;ophers. Yea many philo&s;ophers, even before the coming of Je&s;us Chri&s;t in the world, declared to the &s;ame divine principle, that I believe would unite all men in the ground and bottom of one &s;ub&s;tantial ever-enduring felicity.&mdash;They declared (we may read divers of them)&mdash;they &s;poke of the Divinity that there was ONE that enlightened their minds to know good from evil, and that in&s;pired them to do things that were worthy of their dignity as men and immortals.&mdash;They frequently te&s;tified to that holy principle, which, after all, is the ground-work of all religion in every &s;ort of people; even in idolatrous nations. For JESUS CHRIST came not par|tially to enlighten one, and no other part: He was "The Word that was in the beginning; that was with God, and that was God"&mdash;and that was afterwards made fle&s;h, ac|cording to the will of the father, who could as ea&s;ily have &s;ent him in that body to every corner of the world (we may readily &s;uppo&s;e) and a thou&s;and times more &s;o to na|tural conceptions, for all things are ea&s;y to him as the Creator of the world, and all things that are therein. But I &s;ay he came to enlighten the world with a greater degree of light than ever was before&mdash;to bring light and immor|tality more abundantly to life in the world. And a great and e&s;pecial favour I account it to be. And I believe the more we are acquainted with the Scriptures, the more we &s;hall all be made to acknowledge, they are a &s;pecial favour of God to mankind: containing, in the &s;implicity of their doctrine, the mo&s;t deep and heavenly my&s;teries; and &s;ublime beyond all the writings of any philo&s;ophers in the world, be they ever &s;o great; or any that are called divines: yea,
<PB N="28" REF="032807_0026_0FF5292B008A7168">
they are &s;imply, and virtually in their doctrines, truly &s;ub|lime beyond all the &s;oaring opinions of men! I want the pre&s;ent generation therefore to read for them&s;elves. Search the Scriptures for your&s;elves: let no man come unto you, and &s;ay, "I have &s;tudied them for many years&mdash;I have &s;een them in many languages&mdash;and I can in&s;truct you better than you can be otherwi&s;e in&s;tructed;" for depend upon it, they have &s;ome end to an&s;wer, let them come and &s;ay what they may. Becau&s;e the &s;ame eternal Spirit that gave all the my&s;teries that ever were revealed to mankind, to the prophets or the apo&s;tles, or any of the mini&s;ters whatever, remains to be re&s;orted to this day, the &s;ame as in that day; and the &s;ame eternal Spirit mu&s;t open the Scriptures that gave them: for nothing inferior to the power that gave the glorious and ble&s;&s;ed doctrine of the New Te&s;tament, can reveal and open them to thy under&s;tanding and mine; not all the men of &s;cience in the world, I am per&s;uaded: for we &s;ee it really and truly fulfilled, the Lord has confounded the wi&s;dom of the wi&s;e, and brought to nought the under&s;tanding of the prudent, when they have meddled with the&s;e things. One &s;aying, this is the true interpretation; and another &s;aying, that is the true interpretation; and another &s;aying as it were, I am wi&s;er than thou. Oh, what confu&s;ion has happened among&s;t the poor profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity, wherever this has been the ca&s;e! Now here are &s;ome with the Scriptures in their hands (and, indeed, there is one got over into my nation, where I live, that is leading the people by the ear, with the Scripture in his hand, endeavouring to prove things diametrically incon&s;i&s;tent with the very book that he holds forth!) My friends, how is it, or where &s;hall we find TRUTH? I &s;ee the people are &s;cattered exceedingly by it; &s;ome run for a &s;ea&s;on after one man, and they &s;ay, "This is the man; and now (&s;ay they) I have found him; I never heard one before like this man:" and in a few months (they being un&s;table as water) they are ca&s;t another way:&mdash;and then another comes and &s;ays abundance of fine things, who is very learned and very ele|gant,
<PB N="29" REF="032807_0027_0FF529295F2ABAB0">
and they &s;ay, "This man is come to this place, we will go and hear him." Alas, alas! how this is de&s;cending from the dignity in which we were created, and from the re&s;ource which God has granted; for "God is Light, and in him is no darkne&s;s at all;" he is the light of the world, and the life of men; the light that has enlightened, and will enlighten, every man and woman that cometh into the world." So that the prophets before the coming of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, could &s;ay in confidence, beholding the glorious days in which we live, and which &s;ome of them de&s;ired to &s;ee, for many prophets and righteous men have de&s;ired to &s;ee one of the&s;e days which ye &s;ee, but could not; yet with an eye of faith they beheld it afar off: "Abraham &s;aw my day (&s;ays Chri&s;t) and rejoiced:" Why, how could Abraham &s;ee his day, but through the in&s;hining of that glorious light which gave him to &s;ee the things which God, in the riches of his mercy and wi&s;dom, was de&s;igning to do in the earth? This is the &s;pirit of prophecy.</P>
<P>Well, my friends, have we all received a mea&s;ure of this light? "If any man &s;ays that he has not the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t, then he is none of his. That which is to be known of God is manife&s;ted in man," &s;ays the apo&s;tle.</P>
<P>How plain, how &s;imple are the&s;e doctrines! Is it any wonder that the prophets and the apo&s;tles, who were in&s;pir|ed of God, &s;hould &s;peak in this manner of the go&s;pel day: That we have no need that any man teach us&mdash;that "we have no need that any man &s;hould &s;ay to his brother, or to his neighbour, know thou the Lord; for all men &s;hall know HIM from the lea&s;t to the greate&s;t of them." For "I will write my law in their hearts, I will place it in their inward parts; they &s;hall be my people, and I will be their GOD."</P>
<P>Now this is the doctrine, my friends, which the apo&s;tles preached&mdash;and it is the faith which we contend for. We have no new doctrine to preach unto the world, but the
<PB N="30" REF="032807_0028_0FF52882DBC563E8">
&s;ame that has pa&s;&s;ed the te&s;t of many ages, the &s;ame that the holy men of God continued to declare both before and after the apo&s;tles, and that has been confirmed throughout all the Scripture. This is the faith that the apo&s;tle &s;poke of, when he made mention what faith it was that he con|tended for. He &s;aid he had no need to &s;ay, "who &s;hall a&s;cend up into heaven, that is, to bring Chri&s;t down from thence, or who &s;hall de&s;cend into the depth, that is, to bring up Chri&s;t again from the dead. The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: and this is the word of faith that we preach;" and no other word of faith can ever be preached con&s;i&s;tent with the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t; and this adhered to, my friends, would be &s;ufficient to re|concile all the contradictory differences that are in the world. They would be taught one and the &s;ame thing&mdash; it would put an end to all evil cen&s;uring one another. It would put an end to all per&s;ecutions; to all prejudices one again&s;t another; to all boa&s;ting one again&s;t another, as though I was more holy than thou; as if my &s;y&s;tem was better than thine, and I was nearer the kingdom of heaven than thou art&mdash;all being taught of this divine, eternal, all-&s;ufficient WORD. The people would &s;peak the &s;ame lan|guage: this I am per&s;uaded of. But while they remain to be in the manner that many are, &s;aying, "I am for Paul, I am for Apollos, and I am for Cephas," and are not wil|ling to be gathered to be of Chri&s;t&mdash;for, as &s;aid the apo&s;tle, "Was Paul crucified for you?&mdash;Is Chri&s;t divided?" Can there be any divi&s;ions in his church? No; I conceive not. There can be no rents and &s;chi&s;ms; Chri&s;t and his church being united, they are one in him. And where they are one in him, a glorious and ble&s;&s;ed unity will &s;ub&s;i&s;t, for "one is your ma&s;ter, and all ye are brethren."&mdash;Then there would be no contention for &s;uperiority in the church: no &s;uch thing; it would be impo&s;&s;ible. For if any one of you would be the greate&s;t of all, let him become the &s;ervant of all. This would be the way to be great in the church of Chri&s;t. For it remains to be the &s;ame now that it was in
<PB N="31" REF="032807_0029_0FF5287DD28EABE0">
the days of Chri&s;t's fle&s;h; the way to be the greate&s;t is to be the mo&s;t humble; to be the mo&s;t virtuous; to be full of love and charity towards our fellow-creatures and our fellow-probationers. I &s;ay, this is the only true way to &s;eek dignity in the Church. There would be no a&s;piring after great places and employments in it. Though I have charity to believe that even &s;ome who have been called dig|nitaries of the Church (for indeed the Lord bears with many of our weakne&s;&s;es and infirmities) have been zealous and hone&s;t contenders for the Faith, as far as it plea&s;ed HIM to enlighten them. But I am confident of this in my mind, that the day is ha&s;tening, wherein there will be one Shepherd, and one Sheepfold, the whole world over. For this is the true nature of the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation. But, oh, alas! what does it appear to be in this day?&mdash;How different from the primitive &s;tate, when it was declared, that, "By this &s;hall all men know that ye are my di&s;ciples, <HI>if ye have love one to another."</HI> Well, look over Chri&s;tendom at this day: Does the Mahometan behold our light as it &s;hines? When they take the Te&s;tament in their own hands, they are as wi&s;e to di&s;cern as we are; they are men of the &s;ame powers, and po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;ame faculties to com|pare things as we do. Well, what would an hone&s;t Ma|hometan &s;ay? "Thou endeavoure&s;t to convert me to be a Chri&s;tian: but for what purpo&s;e? Are the Chri&s;tians wi&s;er&mdash;Are they better&mdash;Are they more virtuous than an hone&s;t Mu&s;&s;ulman? Give me an in&s;tance of it. Do they love one another better than the Mahometans?"</P>
<P>Well, my friends, do not be afraid of this inquiry, it is the way to truth; it is the way we mu&s;t examine things; and, as I &s;aid before, it is a day of inquiry: let us not be afraid of inquiry. Men have been afraid of bringing things to the te&s;t. But I believe it will not be &s;ufficient to think &s;o long: and I invite you that are men of freedom, of independent minds, &s;earch for the truth for your&s;elves. Let no man lead you in tho&s;e things which God is &s;ufficient to
<PB N="32" REF="032807_0030_0FF5288D8DA506D8">
direct and lead you into him&s;elf, who is the Fountain of all wi&s;dom and knowledge; who has given thee powers and fa|culties to di&s;cern thy way, and to judge what he has called thee into exi&s;tence for; what is thy bu&s;ine&s;s in thy pa&s;&s;ing through the pre&s;ent tran&s;ient &s;tate of being, &s;o that thou maye&s;t inherit eternal life.</P>
<P>O Chri&s;tendom! thou oughte&s;t to be a light to enlighten the Heathen, and a glory; aye, the glory of GOD, to the ends of the earth! How they mu&s;t look upon us! For even the Mahometans, having the New Te&s;tament in their hands, how mu&s;t they &s;tand amazed, when they come to compare the&s;e things with that our great Leader &s;aid: "By this &s;hall all men know that ye are my di&s;ciples, becau&s;e ye love one another." And are there any people more at di&s;|cord?&mdash;Are there any more at variance either in a private or in a publick national capacity?&mdash;O! how this has wound|ed me!&mdash;bear with me, my friends, I do not wi&s;h to hurt any mind pre&s;ent by any means whatever. If thou thinke&s;t not as I think, thou wilt not be judged by my con&s;cience; but by the light thou ha&s;t received thy&s;elf. And if thine heart condemn thee not, then wilt thou have faith and hope towards God; and I condemn thee not neither: but while we are endeavouring to &s;eek after truth, do not let us be afraid of coming to the knowledge of it.</P>
<P>But, my friends, let us &s;ee whereabouts we are&mdash;If the foundation of God &s;tands where it u&s;ed to be; whether <HI>we</HI> are really upon the &s;ame unchangeable foundation which the apo&s;tles were? And if we are, then we may be in the &s;ame glorious and holy confidence which they were; we may rejoice with a hope that will not fail us in the hour of death; and that we &s;hall receive a crown of immortality, if we are building as they built; and if we are adhering to the &s;ame ground of faith which they did. Well then, &s;ome may &s;ay, they have examined the&s;e things. It will not do us any hurt to examine them over and over again. TRUTH is precious, and no matter how much time is &s;pent
<PB N="33" REF="032807_0031_0FF52892ACDD36D8">
in inve&s;tigating of it. For, &s;ure I am, if the go&s;pel &s;pirit had been continued to this day, thou&s;ands and ten thou&s;ands that have fell in the field of battle would not have died in that way, and the carnage and deva&s;tation that de&s;olated &s;o many parts of Europe would have been prevented. O the cry of the widows and the tender orphans in the &s;everal countries of Europe! Ought this to have been? Or would it ever have been, if men had kept to the principle which taught them not only to love their brethren, but to love their <HI>enemies;</HI> to do good to them that per&s;ecuted them, and that de&s;pitefully u&s;ed them; that &s;o they might be the children of their heavenly Father, who cau&s;eth the rain to de&s;cend, and the &s;un to &s;hine, both upon the ju&s;t and the unju&s;t.</P>
<P>"Why (&s;ome may &s;ay) Do not talk of things impo&s;&s;i|ble. Is it po&s;&s;ible for a man to be brought into &s;uch a condition as not to revenge injuries and in&s;ults?" I be|lieve it is; and that it is the di&s;po&s;ition that every Chri&s;tian ought to be brought into&mdash;not to revenge injuries and in|&s;ults, but to bear them with patience.</P>
<P>Some may here &s;ay, "What would&s;t thou have us to be <HI>cowards?"</HI> No; but <HI>heroes</HI> in the LAMB'S army. And who is there that needs be a&s;hamed to be in the LAMB'S army, to gain the victory? It would be a thou&s;and times more magnanimous indeed to put up with little injuries, one with another, than to re&s;ent them in anger; it &s;hows a low and little mind to do that; great minds are above it. And the Chri&s;tian &s;ees a &s;tate exalted far beyond this, and that we are even called to it, the very form of our prayer te&s;tifies: "If thou forgive&s;t not tho&s;e that tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t thee, (our ble&s;&s;ed Lord &s;aid) neither will thy Father which is in heaven forgive thee." The&s;e are &s;olid and un&s;haken Truths, that all the &s;ophi&s;try of men will never be able to invalidate.&mdash;<HI>"Forgive us our tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, as we forgive them that tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t us"</HI>&mdash;Who then can &s;ay this prayer, and &s;till continue in a &s;pirit of revenge; and &s;ay to his brother, an eye
<PB N="34" REF="032807_0032_0FF5296239297FC8">
for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth; thou ha&s;t injured me, and I will injure thee? Well, then tho&s;e ought to be care|ful upon what terms they lay their &s;alvation; for the Lord is here pre&s;cribing the very terms in his excellent prayer, "Forgive us our tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, only as we forgive them that tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t us: this is the true meaning of the prayer. No further praye&s;t thou when thou u&s;e&s;t the prayer given by our ble&s;&s;ed Lord him&s;elf. But, my friends, though I do not want to enlarge a great deal, I want to &s;ee the peaceable &s;tan|dard of righteou&s;ne&s;s exalted, both in this nation and in all the nations of the earth; and that the &s;pirit of per&s;ecution and de&s;troying of one another might be entirely done away, by all being brought down into the meek &s;pirit of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and be, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, as he was, when he was per&s;ecuted even to death on the cro&s;s. (O how meekly he bore it for our &s;ake!&mdash;And &s;hall we not bear with one another? I tru&s;t all will confe&s;s we ought to do.) He &s;aid in the depth of his agony, "Father forgive them:" though he could have called down legions of Angels to tho&s;e corrupt and wicked men; yet he &s;aid in meekne&s;s (which I believe many have partook of, in a mea&s;ure, &s;ince this day) "Father forgive them, for they know not what they do." And the next martyr, Stephen, when he was brought to the gates of the city, and was &s;toned to death, he followed his Lord in the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition; he kneeled down when in the mid&s;t of them, and &s;aid, "Lord lay not this &s;in to their charge." Having lifted up his eyes to heaven, and peti|tioned his Saviour to receive his &s;oul, he at la&s;t &s;aid, "Lord lay not this &s;in to their charge:" and &s;o &s;aying, he fell a&s;leep in the arms, no doubt, of his glorious Lord and Ma&s;ter, whom he followed even to death.</P>
<P>Now, my friends, there is no new law; there is no new di&s;pen&s;ation. Many of the martyrs were of the &s;ame faith, which they had attained through God's mercy, and the in|fluence of his Spirit upon theirs; and the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition of mind al&s;o. So that when they were led forth in the
<PB N="35" REF="032807_0033_0FF5288F256516F0">
days of per&s;ecution, which the church was per&s;ecuted with, O how meek did &s;ome of them deliver up their &s;ouls to God, and their bodies into the hands of their wretched per&s;ecu|tors! There were &s;ome hundreds of them fell a &s;acrifice for their faith and belief in God. How pious, how calm did they go out of the world! Not reviling becau&s;e they were reviled: By no means. Not giving abu&s;e for abu&s;e, but contrariwi&s;e, ble&s;&s;ing their per&s;ecutors. This was the condition of tho&s;e, knowing (as the apo&s;tle &s;aid) they were thereunto called, that they might al&s;o inherit a ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>Well, my friends, the&s;e are &s;o many monuments of God's adorable mercy and power: and the &s;ame God reigneth over all in this day; and he is as able to &s;upport us in the faith once delivered to the Saints, as he was in that day: and I tru&s;t tho&s;e that are earne&s;tly concerned to inquire after it, will know it to their comfort, without the aid or a&s;&s;i&s;tance of any man whatever. GOD is as &s;ufficient for the&s;e things now as he was in all the generations that are pa&s;t. It only wants application of mind&mdash;Serious &s;olemn meditation, and contemplation upon the things of God; then all would know the Truth, and abiding in it, they would all be made preachers of Right|eou&s;ne&s;s in their &s;everal &s;ituations in the world. Aye, one of tho&s;e that was per&s;ecuted, when &s;he was brought before her per&s;ecutors to an&s;wer for her faith, was neverthele&s;s furni&s;hed with that wi&s;dom which confounded the wi&s;dom of the wi&s;e that was among&s;t her per&s;ecutors; &s;o that they thought &s;he had an&s;wered wi&s;er than them all. And a cer|tain little maid, when many were brought forth to the &s;take, was brought before her per&s;ecutors, they &s;aid to her, "And what can you &s;ay, my little maid, for your faith?" Why, &s;aid &s;he, "I am not able to contend for CHRIST; but I am able to do more: I am able to &s;uffer for Chri&s;t." Now, my friends, I am per&s;uaded this would be the con|dition of all of us; by inward, &s;olid, reverent inquiry after
<PB N="36" REF="032807_0034_0FF529704016DF78">
it. Then you would not be a&s;toni&s;hed to &s;ee people &s;it down in &s;ilence, either in their own hou&s;es, or in the A&s;&s;embly of God's people; &s;o that God would conde&s;cend to be with them, and enlighten their minds. For "if any man lack wi&s;dom, let him a&s;k of God, who giveth liberally, and up|braideth none." O may the God of all mercy, wi&s;dom, and power, ha&s;ten this day; enlarge the love of profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity one towards another: throw down all the walls of oppo&s;ition, which were built up in the day of departure from the fountain of living water; and bring us again to drink at Shiloh's &s;tream; that all the heritage may drink at the fountain it&s;elf; and the world once more rejoice in knowing him to reign and to rule over all; who&s;e right it is, and ever will remain.</P>

<HEAD>The Prayer before the Sermon.</HEAD>
<P>O THOU great adorable Being, who art exalted in Goodne&s;s, and Maje&s;ty, and in Power, beyond all finite comprehen&s;ion, who dwelle&s;t in the light where|unto none can approach thee, but as thou art plea&s;ed in thine adorable mercy to open an acce&s;s to us; and though Heaven is thy Throne, O God, and Earth is thy foot&s;tool, yet we remember that thou ha&s;t promi&s;ed that thou wilt conde&s;cend to look down upon the poor, and upon the contrite, and tho&s;e that tremble at thy word.</P>
<P>O Thou, un&s;earchable in holine&s;s, and glorious in power, we pray thee to look down upon the pre&s;ent congregation this evening, with an eye of compa&s;&s;ion and divine pity. Thou beholde&s;t all men where&s;oever they are &s;cattered upon the face of the whole earth, with an equal eye of mercy, and thou heare&s;t the prayers of all tho&s;e who draw nigh unto thee with &s;incerity. Be plea&s;ed, O God, to cau&s;e thy animating pre&s;ence to be with us, to bring the minds of all the people into an holy &s;olemnity before thee. We know, O God, that no man can promote thy glorious Cau&s;e of Truth and Righteou&s;ne&s;s in the earth, but as thou art plea&s;ed to be with him, and to furni&s;h him with the nece&s;&s;ary qualifications for the great and important work whereunto thou art calling thy &s;ervants and mini&s;ters. O ble&s;&s;ed Father, for&s;ake them not, but be plea&s;ed, as in generations that are pa&s;t, to pour forth thy Spirit upon thy mini&s;ters, that, in that wi&s;dom which thou art plea&s;ed to grant from &s;ea&s;on to &s;ea&s;on, they may go forth in thy name, with the Word of Reconciliation and Faith.</P>
<P>O Lord, Thou ha&s;t many &s;ouls that are wandering up and down this great and populous country, who are &s;eek|ing after thy glorious and ble&s;&s;ed re&s;t, which thou alone can&s;t lead them into the enjoyment of. We humbly and
<PB N="40" REF="032807_0037_0FF5296473158B90">
reverently pray thee, O God, to draw the minds of the people more and more off from thy mini&s;ters to thy&s;elf. O gracious God, un&s;eal the fountain whereat thy prophets, thy apo&s;tles, thy &s;ervants, in all generations, have &s;o freely drank and been filled. Cau&s;e tho&s;e that hunger and thir&s;t after righteou&s;ne&s;s to be more and more filled at thy boun|tiful table; that &s;o, Father, there may be among all ranks of the people more of the knowledge of thee, and more of an increa&s;e in following after thee in the way to everla&s;ting re&s;t.</P>
<P>O God, thou &s;ee&s;t how weak we are; how &s;urrounded with infirmities, how blinded with prejudices, how turned a&s;ide by a variety of fluctuating opinions; cau&s;e, we pray thee, thy holy uniting Word to be read more and more in the hearts of the people. Sound the alarm, we pray thee, yet louder and louder to them that are at ea&s;e and forgetful of thee: that &s;o, Father, there may be many more brought to drink at the fountain of thy Goodne&s;s and Mercy, and with reverence of &s;oul to acknowledge that thou art good, and worthy to be wor&s;hipped here, and to be obeyed and &s;erved by all the workman&s;hip of thy hands. O gracious Father, proclaim a &s;ign in this a&s;&s;embly, while with one accord, in humility of &s;oul, which thou ha&s;t granted us, we may draw nigh unto thee, and offer up at this time for all thy former mercies, and for thy pre&s;ent mercies; and gather us together in this manner, O Father, a&s;cribing unto thee glory and honour, thank&s;giving and prai&s;e, which are thy due, both now and for evermore.</P>

<P>THERE are &s;ome weighty and intere&s;ting expre&s;&s;ions which we find in the Revelation of John<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Revelations xiv. 7, 8.</NOTE>, that appear to be my duty, &s;ince I la&s;t took my &s;eat, to mention in this a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P><Q>And I (John) &s;aw another angel fly in the mid&s;t of heaven, having the everla&s;ting go&s;pel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, &s;aying with a loud voice, <HI>"Fear GOD</HI> and give glory to Him; for the hour of His judgment is come; and wor&s;hip Him that made heaven and earth, and the &s;ea, and the fountains of waters.</Q></P>
<P>Now John, we find, calls this <HI>the everla&s;ting go&s;pel;</HI> which &s;eems to be compri&s;ed in a very &s;hort and compendious manner; which no man in all this congregation, I tru&s;t, can be at a lo&s;s to under&s;tand. And though, my friends, we may he &s;omething various in our opinions concerning modes, manner and forms of wor&s;hip, yet I believe there are very few of God's rational creation any where, either among&s;t tho&s;e who are profe&s;&s;ing the name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, or tho&s;e that have not been favoured to be acquainted with the go&s;pel as we are, but are &s;en&s;ible that To God belongs glory, honour, and wor&s;hip; who behold him as the great and univer&s;al parent, the glorious, ble&s;&s;ed and all-wi&s;e Ar|chitect of the univer&s;e, and all things that are therein, and that &s;u&s;tains all things by the word of his invincible power; for the &s;ame almighty creating word that brought all things into the glorious order in which we &s;ee them, that &s;aid, let there be light, and there was light&mdash;No man can di&s;pute but he at his plea&s;ure al&s;o could again &s;ay, let there be darkne&s;s, and there would have been darkne&s;s: Again, let the heavenly luminaries depart from their appointed &s;pheres,
<PB N="42" REF="032807_0039_0FF52890BB4DF9F0">
and let all things re&s;ort to their primitive re&s;t, and it would undoubtedly have been done. So that he is not only the cau&s;e of all things, but the gracious &s;upporter, daily and hourly &s;u&s;tainer of all that he has made, without who&s;e ble&s;&s;ed providence there is not an ear of corn or blade of gra&s;s could po&s;&s;ibly be produced. So that, my friends, a daily dependance upon that GOD who created us&mdash; all his creation calls for, and with every &s;olid and re|flecting mind it will naturally produce, an offering of wor|&s;hip, adoration, and prai&s;e; and I am glad in believing, my friends, that here are in this large multitude a con|&s;iderable number who wor&s;hip GOD in &s;pirit and in truth; though differently educated, and of various opinions in things of little importance, but in the great, important, and e&s;&s;ential point of every man's duty, &s;peak the &s;ame lan|guage; and I believe, my friends, this is the ca&s;e both with the nations that are called <HI>refined,</HI> and with tho&s;e that are termed <HI>barbarians.</HI> GOD has placed his law in the hearts of all men; he has written there the great and e&s;&s;ential duty which he requires at our hands, and under every name and in every nation <HI>"they that fear God and work righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> (&s;o &s;aid the apo&s;tle) <HI>are accepted of him."</HI> So that, my friends, he makes no &s;uch di&s;tinctions as many of us poor, finite and weak creatures are apt to make; he does not confine acceptable wor&s;hip to this nation, to this particular &s;ect or opinion, nor to this particular I&s;land: but I believe there are prayers a&s;cend to him as &s;weet incen&s;e before his Holy Altar, both in the wilderne&s;s of America, and in the dark abodes of Africa, and in all the corners of the earth, wherever there are &s;incere and upright &s;ouls.</P>
<P>Well, my friends, this mu&s;t certainly ari&s;e from &s;ome exten&s;ively and univer&s;ally diffu&s;ed principle in the &s;ouls of men, that with one common con&s;ent they agree in the great fundamentals of all Religion; this mu&s;t be &s;omething more &mdash;even the infidel, if he con&s;iders, mu&s;t allow it is &s;ome|thing more&mdash;than human policy. Well, what is it then?
<PB N="43" REF="032807_0040_0FF528B16AD220B0">
What is it that prepareth the heart thus acceptably to offer unto GOD!&mdash;What is it that teacheth all men that HE ought to be wor&s;hipped? Why, it is nothing more, nor any thing le&s;s than the &s;ame eternal all-creating word, who fil|leth all things, and is as intimately near to and independent of us as the very air we breathe; "for, (&s;aid the apo&s;tle) He is not far off any one of you; neither can he be; for in him we live, move, and have our being." Therefore it was that he exhorted them to <HI>"&s;eek the Lord, if haply they might find him."</HI> Well, my friends, this is the great bu&s;ine&s;s of every Go&s;pel mini&s;ter; to labour to bring people here&mdash;to &s;eek for them&s;elves; to &s;eek the Lord, if haply they may find HIM&mdash;Who is not far off any one of you; who is both with you, and in you, and without who&s;e animating power thou could&s;t not exi&s;t one moment; neither could any man think a good thought or do a good action, except the Lord be with him. This is my faith. So that, my friends, it has taught me to get rid of all tho&s;e narrow di&s;tinctions which many have been making, and which &s;ome are yet indu&s;triou&s;ly endeavouring to build up between even the followers of the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us; who ought always to be unit|ed &mdash;always in harmony&mdash;always ONE, IN HIM. But, for my own part, having now for a number of years endea|voured to &s;eek the Lord impartially for my&s;elf, I have known him in this way; I have learned the Go&s;pel in this way. For I have been clear in my opinion that all the in|ventions and works of men, by their fallen wi&s;dom, have only &s;cattered the &s;piritual &s;heep in Jacob and divided them in I&s;rael; and have &s;plit the chri&s;tian church into &s;o great a variety of names, and &s;o great a variety of forms. For indeed we find many of them are rooted in prejudice one again&s;t another, Therefore the inquiry of this day &s;eems to be, not &s;o much, is it THE TRUTH that the&s;e men hold; but is he of <HI>my</HI> name?&mdash;or what <HI>name</HI> does he hold? this &s;eems to be the fooli&s;h inquiry of many who can accept little or nothing except it comes from tho&s;e who are e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in the &s;ame opinion, and within the bounds which
<PB N="44" REF="032807_0041_0FF5289E68616AE8">
<HI>they</HI> have built, and called after their own name among men. But, my friends, my belief is, that the Lord is ari&s;|ing in the earth to put an end to the&s;e divi&s;ions and di&s;trac|tions in his church; to bring down all tho&s;e who have been exalted in their imaginations in &s;uppo&s;ing that they <HI>only</HI> were the people of GOD, in <HI>their form</HI> and in <HI>their manner,</HI> and reject all others.</P>
<P>O! how far off from that benevolence of &s;oul which the chri&s;tian religion in&s;pires, appears faith of this kind!&mdash; And yet there are &s;ome remaining even in this enlightened day, who &s;uppo&s;e and believe that without the pale of their particular church there can no man be &s;aved.</P>
<P>But whence come the&s;e opinions? why I believe the Lord originally &s;owed good feed in his church, but while men have &s;lept in carnal ea&s;e and &s;ecurity, an enemy has entered, &s;cattered and divided them; and &s;own tares among them. Now, for my own part, it appears to me to be the great work of every diligent &s;hep&s;herd of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t to labour to bring all men back to the foundation&mdash; to the one true and overla&s;ting fold. To remove all tho&s;e opinions that have kept the world at variance &s;o long&mdash;even in tho&s;e that have loved God with &s;incerity of heart in their different profe&s;&s;ions among chri&s;tians. O! how &s;hy they have been of one another&mdash;how afraid of coming into the company of one another&mdash;how they have &s;hunned one ano|ther! Aye, my friends, can this be agreeable to the glori|ous and dignified go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t that we profe&s;s? No: I tru&s;t no man will believe it can. Well then, the <HI>great</HI> inquiry ought to be, is there not one univer&s;al guide &mdash;one holy, divine, and unchangeable principle, by which we may all again be gathered into unity? Is there no &s;uch thing as TRUTH in the earth? I believe there is; and that all men may find it too, who are &s;tudiou&s;ly de&s;irous &s;o to do &mdash;who prefer the knowledge of the truth to all things el&s;e&mdash; who are making every &s;econdary con&s;ideration give way to their obtaining it; and when they have found it, to live in
<PB N="45" REF="032807_0042_0FF528B305E46088">
obedience to it. This is the &s;incere heart's enquiry among all the various names; that GOD will be plea&s;ed to teach them the way of TRUTH, and e&s;tabli&s;h them in it. So that they &s;hall all &s;peak the fame language, that there may be no diver&s;ity of opinion in the ground and foundation of their belief. For this holy principle is <HI>one</HI>&mdash;it teaches plain, &s;imple, and ea&s;y doctrine; compri&s;ed within a narrow compa&s;s, it does not confound and confu&s;e the world with variety of my&s;tical opinions, which are hard, or which if is impo&s;&s;ible to comprehend. But the TRUTH upon which glory, immortality, and eternal life depend, is plain, free, and &s;imple: <HI>"To know</HI> THEE <HI>the only true God, and</HI> JESUS CHRIST <HI>whom thou ha&s;t &s;ent, is life eternal."</HI></P>
<P>Well, my friends, how &s;hall we know this?&mdash;where &s;hall we find it?&mdash;how &s;hall we be a&s;&s;ured that we are really in this knowledge&mdash;and in this faith? why, I think, if men&mdash;I &s;peak now in much charity, for I do not boa&s;t of my own attainments, but what I feel and believe to be true from my own experience, and which appears to me to be con&s;i&s;tent with the doctrines both of the Old and New Te&s;tament, that I am not a&s;hamed to declare, though it were to thou|&s;ands and ten thou&s;ands; for I &s;ay from the very beginning there was an ETERNAL PRINCIPLE&mdash;there was an holy un|flattering and unchangeable GUIDE placed in the &s;ouls of men, which if they had attended to, all men would have been led &s;afe. "It is &s;hewn to thee, (&s;ays the prophet) O man, what thou &s;hould&s;t do, and what the Lord thy God requireth at thy hands; to do ju&s;tice, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God."&mdash;It is &s;hewn to thee what is good.&mdash;The&s;e are the forcible expre&s;&s;ions&mdash;to "DO JUS|TICE, to LOVE MARCY, to WALK HUMBLY WITH THE GOD."</P>
<P>And here I believe is the ground work and foundation of all religion. Can any man &s;ay it is not &s;hewn to him, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of mini&s;ters, or any human learning, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of men learned in the &s;chools, men of
<PB N="46" REF="032807_0043_0FF528D1DED9E360">
&s;cience, men of many languages, or men of profound edu|cation &mdash;we can attain the knowledge of the&s;e &s;aving truths, which are &s;o e&s;&s;ential for us to know, believe and practi&s;e? So that no man has any occa&s;ion, by any means whatever, to go inquire of his neighbour, or of his brother, concerning the&s;e things. So that, my friends, though indeed we have invited you here, and are glad of your company to &s;it down in this manner, we &s;eek not any thing that is yours, but <HI>you</HI> only; to GOD, not to our&s;elves&mdash;not to this and that opinion; but that all men may come to the divine, eternal, and unchangeable <HI>principle</HI> in <HI>them&s;elves,</HI> that would teach us in all things, the &s;ame that is &s;poken of in a variety of pa&s;&s;ages in Scripture; and yet in this day &s;o much neglected; the &s;ame that our Saviour promi&s;ed &s;hould be with his followers to the end of the world; even his own eternal Spirit, the Spirit of GOD and of CHRIST. This is the Ruler, the Director, the glorious and ble&s;&s;ed Regulator of all things. Without it the Scriptures could never have been given. Becau&s;e by it all the men of God were in|&s;pired to behold the light God had granted them concerning the things thereof; and by it all men are enlightened, more or le&s;s. For JESUS CHRIST is "the true LIGHT that en|lighteneth," not only tho&s;e that have read the hi&s;tory of his life, death, and &s;ufferings; his glorious and unparal|lelled Miracles and divine doctrines; but al&s;o tho&s;e that have never heard of the name of CHRIST.</P>
<P>So enlarged is my opinion concerning the equality of God's ways. And the Scripture amply and fully ju&s;tifies this opinion; for Chri&s;t is called, not only the <HI>light</HI> of his own followers who believed on him, but the <HI>true</HI> "light, that enlighteneth every man that cometh into the world;" be they of what name, of what di&s;tinction, or nation they may. And this <HI>light,</HI> (&s;ays the Evangeli&s;t John) is come into the world: But the rea&s;on why men continue under condemnation is this, (&s;ays he) <HI>"light</HI> is come into the world, but men love darkne&s;s rather than light, becau&s;e
<PB N="47" REF="032807_0044_0FF52915A1B2EC30">
their deeds are evil:" they are not willing to bring their deeds to this glorious touch-&s;tone, this te&s;t that would try all manner of actions&mdash;Chri&s;t IN you, the hope of everla&s;t|ing glory; in which the primitive believers were &s;ettled, and found here their re&s;t.</P>
<P>Here, from the beginning, the Church of Chri&s;t was built; upon this Holy of Holies, and everla&s;ting word of Chri&s;t and of God; &s;peaking, directing, teaching, and leading them, where&s;oever they &s;hould go. And if men had abode under this, it would have taught them all the &s;ame thing; it would have pre&s;erved tho&s;e that have called them&s;elves Chri&s;tians, as well as all other men, in harmony and unity. It could have made neither rents nor divi&s;ions. No; no &s;uch thing: It would not have told thee one thing, and me another. By no means. But this is the language it would have proclaimed in thy heart and in mine, that "The work of Righteou&s;ne&s;s is peace, and the effect thereof is quietne&s;s and a&s;&s;urance for ever." Now is not this written upon every man's con&s;cience? Yes, I am per|&s;uaded it is. And I have heard the wild inhabitants of America declare this was <HI>the truth;</HI> and they found it in&s;crib|ed upon their hearts (according to their own expre&s;&s;ions) by the finger of God's &s;pirit him&s;elf, namely, that the work of Righteou&s;ne&s;s is peace, and the way to be happy in this pre&s;ent life, and to be eternally happy in the world to come, is, to obey his voice; to work Righteou&s;ne&s;s; to be upright in heart; to do tho&s;e things which, by his law written in them, he had made known to them they ought to do: and this divine principle I want more to come unto. But men have been too long bewildered in following one another in darkne&s;s and confu&s;ion: this is my faith, and I believe no man among us can &s;ay but this is the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t (if ever we are brought back) come to the foundation and corner-&s;tone whereon the fir&s;t Church was built. We mu&s;t go to Chri&s;t; we mu&s;t leave our depend|ance upon man, and come to the <HI>Fountain.</HI> For the &s;ame
<PB N="48" REF="032807_0045_0FF52881424705E8">
declaration may indeed be put to thee, and the expre&s;&s;ion will hold good with re&s;pect to far too many in this day, that was expre&s;&s;ed concerning the Jews,&mdash;"My people have committed two great evils, they have for&s;aken me the foun|tain of living waters, and they have hewn out to them&s;elves broken ci&s;terns that can hold no water." Well, my friends, I am a&s;&s;ured that many of you a&s;&s;ent to this, that of all the &s;y&s;tems and inventions of men, be they ever &s;o &s;pecious, or maintained with ever &s;o much pomp or elo|quence, the&s;e do not nor cannot bring one &s;oul to Chri&s;t. It mu&s;t be &s;omething beyond all the powers of men; it mu&s;t be by his own eternal power, if ever we are brought to experience the glorious and ble&s;&s;ed re&s;t prepared for tho&s;e that love him. For no man can come to the Father but by Chri&s;t; and "no man (&s;aid he) can come to me except my Father draw him." If Noah, Job, and Daniel were here, they could &s;ave neither &s;on nor daughter's life; they could only, through God's grace, and attention to his in|&s;peaking word, be in&s;trumental to &s;ave their own &s;ouls.</P>
<P>For no man can either do the work for another, or by any means direct him after &s;afety, but this holy, internal, unchangeable guide alone. Are there any per&s;ons pre&s;ent who &s;ay, "this is &s;trange doctrine?" Well, my friends, if it is &s;trange doctrine, it has this to recommend it at lea&s;t, that it is not <HI>new;</HI> it is as old as the Apo&s;tles days, and as old as the Prophets days, in former di&s;pen&s;ations. But I be|lieve life and immortality were in a more marvellous manner brought to light by the revelation of God, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Therefore we need go no further back than the New Te&s;tament; for by the doctrine therein contained, we hope and believe we are to be &s;aved. Is not this the ca&s;e? Yes, I believe it is. Well then, my friends, let us &s;ee whether we live up to this doctrine. Let us &s;ee whether we really are what the primitive churches were. Let us find whether our belief is rightly founded, or whether we depend merely upon hear-&s;ay. 'Tis not upon the
<PB N="49" REF="032807_0046_0FF5287FA8049930">
<HI>hear-&s;ay</HI> opinions of men; 'tis not from the works of the learned, nor from the &s;peeches of eloquence, but upon &s;omething that we feel within. For I believe this mu&s;t fi|nally be the ca&s;e, if ever we are prepared to join the ho&s;t of heaven, the redeemed and &s;aved of God. We mu&s;t know the truth in our&s;elves. Chri&s;t is the way, the truth, and the life; and he told us this before he left the world. He told us plainly that he that is with you &s;hall be in you. Is there any doctrine more clear than this. "He that is with you &s;hall be in you: and lo I am with you to the end of the world. And if I go away, I will pray the Father, and he &s;hall &s;end another comforter:" that is, in another form, He &s;hall &s;end the Spirit of Truth, who &s;hall lead and guide you into all truth. Well, here is a &s;afe direction, and an unchangeable directory too. He &s;hall &s;end you another comforter, even the &s;pirit of truth; who &s;hall lead and guide you into all truth; who &s;hall take from me, and &s;hew it to you, and &s;hall bring all things to your remembrance. Can there be any plainer doctrine than this? I believe many of you, my friends, a&s;&s;ent to the truth of this, and that this is the way in which we ought to inquire after the Truth as it is in Je&s;us; we ought to come to Him him&s;elf: we ought to retire to that holy uniting Word which we have received: (for as &s;aid the Apo&s;tle) ye have no need that any man teach you. Why then are there &s;o many teachers in the world; and maintained at &s;o va&s;t an expen&s;e? Why do &s;o many take &s;o much pains to qualify them&s;elves to be teachers of the flock of Chri&s;t, if this is really the ca&s;e? And I tru&s;t, my friends, you will be candid enough to &s;ay, Certainly it is. You have no need that any man teach you, but as this &s;ame uniting Word teaches you, which is truth. I tru&s;t I am &s;urrounded with many tender hearts, and many charitable Chri&s;tians, who have been &s;eeking the truth for many years; why then, my friends, you mu&s;t come to this divine teacher before ever you can be favoured with the knowledge of the truth.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="032807_0047_0FF528E2E686C330">I verily believe no man will ever come to the knowledge of the truth in any other way. Thou may'&s;t explore volumes after volumes, and &s;pend much time in reading of many pi|ous books, and experiences of many favourite men of God. I do not de&s;pi&s;e inferior helps. The Scriptures are ex|cellent: they are much more &s;o, and worthier to be held in greater e&s;timation than all the books in the world. But the Scriptures point only to that holy all-powerful Word which indeed gave all the Scripture. The whole tenor of the Go&s;pel doctrine is to bring men there&mdash;to &s;ettle them upon that foundation; where they may build with &s;afety&mdash; to the teachings of the holy and ble&s;&s;ed &s;pirit of God within them. I know this is a doctrine too much exploded. How unju&s;t! how derogatory to the goodne&s;s and mercy of God, to &s;end thou&s;ands and millions of thou&s;ands into this world, with powers and faculties to conceive that there is immor|tality, and to believe that there are glorious rewards in the world to come, if he had left us no other guide to go by.</P>
<P>Now &s;ome will &s;ay, "We have the Scriptures to go by." Do we not &s;ee enough of this? Truly the Scriptures do direct us to this glorious principle within us, yet how do men turn them to every purpo&s;e! one learned man &s;tarts up in one quarter of the nation, and he &s;ays, "here is a por|tion of Scripture, and I a&s;&s;ure you it means &s;o and &s;o;"&mdash; and another declares with equal learning, with a great deal of &s;tudy, and with abundance of eloquence, "my friends, it is &s;o and &s;o, this way you mu&s;t believe:" and there is one even gone over to the country of my nativity, who with the New Te&s;tament in his hands, is laying the axe by his arguments as much as is in his power to the very root of the Chri&s;tian Religion. This is my faith, that he is de&s;troying the foundation whereon it is built, and yet pretending to bring his doctrine from the Scripture. But what will not &s;ophi&s;try do?&mdash;What has it not done?&mdash;O! the evils it has produced in the world. But I tru&s;t neither this man, leaned and wi&s;e as he may be in the world's e&s;ti|mation,

nor any other, will ever be able to &s;ap that foun|dation which God has laid in Sion, nor to rob you or my own &s;oul of that glorious hope and ble&s;&s;ed con&s;olation in the redemption and mediation of our dear Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t,&mdash;God forbid it &s;hould: and I tru&s;t it will not. &mdash;The Lord will by his own light and power di&s;pel every cloud and darkne&s;s that &s;hall ari&s;e to ca&s;t up a mi&s;t before the eyes of the profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>But to return. I want you, my friends, it is my mo&s;t earne&s;t labour where&s;oever it may plea&s;e God to take me, throughout his vineyard, to get people if po&s;&s;ible to build upon a foundation that tho&s;e various opinions of men will not be able to &s;hake. I know that there is a foundation where all tho&s;e various and contradictory opini|ons of men may butt again&s;t the hone&s;t and &s;incere-hearted pilgrim's dwelling, and not be able to &s;hake it. This I am per&s;uaded of. Verily there is a Re&s;t for the people of God; there is &s;omething whereon we may build &s;afe; that is, in Chri&s;t: "CHRIST IN YOU the hope of glory." O! that you may &s;eek to him! God is no re&s;pecter of per&s;ons: He will teach all men him&s;elf; he will manife&s;t his mercy equally to all men: he rejects none: he makes none of the di&s;tinctions of high and low, rich and poor, that we poor weak beings do. No: he is equal in his ways and ju&s;t in all his doings: and tho&s;e that come to him he will in no wi&s;e ca&s;t out. For "there is no difference (&s;ays the Apo&s;tle) between the Jew and Greek; for one God over all, is rich unto all that come unto him;" rich to all that &s;eek him; and &s;o he remains to be.</P>
<P>O my friends, were you to adhere to the&s;e plain and &s;im|ple truths, it would prevent a great deal of confu&s;ion in the world; it would bring about a different face and ap|pearance among the profe&s;&s;ors of chri&s;tianity, from what we now behold in Europe; it would put an end to all di&s;|&s;en&s;ions; it would put an end to all envying one another; to all fal&s;e, to all evil &s;peaking, and even evil thinking
<PB N="52" REF="032807_0049_0FF528EFD20071B8">
one of another. This I am confident of, if it was adhered to. For Chri&s;t and his glorious di&s;pen&s;ation, is not a di&s;|pen&s;ation of &s;trife and di&s;pute: for when he came, there was even uttered by the Songs of Angels, <HI>"Peace on Earth, and Good-will to Men."</HI> And he declared that, "By this &s;hould all men know that ye are my di&s;ciples&mdash;if ye love one another." And &s;o we may as rea&s;onably conclude, that by this &s;hall all men know that ye are not Chri&s;t's di&s;|ciples, ye if hate, devour, and de&s;troy one another. It is as clear to me as the Sun that &s;hines in the firmament. He was the Prince of Peace; of who&s;e Government the Prophet I&s;aiah declares there never &s;hould be an end. O my fellow Chri&s;tians, let us with all our &s;ouls draw nigh unto, and &s;eek for his holy power to influence our hearts; that he may bring us into the bond of chri&s;tian charity, and of holy and ble&s;&s;ed union one with another; that He may de&s;troy all that &s;eeks to blow up nations and kingdoms into confu&s;ion&mdash;and that &s;eeks to bring di&s;tre&s;s upon individuals, nations and countries! Do not we behold the ravages of WAR? what has it done even in this nation, where the &s;ound of WAR has only been heard, how many weeping widows? how many tender parents has it lately deprived of their &s;upport. It never would have been &s;o, I am per&s;uaded, if the profe&s;&s;ors of chri&s;tianity had kept to their fir&s;t principle. No man can believe it, I think, with the Bible in his hand: which forbids in our Lord's expre&s;s words our &s;aying in this glorious day, "An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth." Yet alas! Is it not the language too much u&s;ed among us?&mdash;"Thou ha&s;t injured me and therefore I will injure thee:&mdash;thou ha&s;t &s;poken evil of me and I will &s;peak evil al&s;o of thee." But ought it to be &s;o? &mdash;Ought we not rather to &s;uffer injuries, as the primitive believers did, without murmuring; without complaining? They received them all with meekne&s;s, as their holy and ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer did before them; who even when he was about to quit the body by the hands of cruel men, did not he &s;et us a glorious example, even towards his la&s;t moments, "Father, forgive them, &s;ays he, for they know not what
<PB N="53" REF="032807_0050_0FF529483822AAA0">
they do!" He that had power to call legions of angels at his command, meekly in this manner addre&s;&s;ed his father."</P>
<P>"Well: (but &s;ome may &s;ay) Is it really po&s;&s;ible to come into this &s;pirit of forgiving of injuries&mdash;to bear in|&s;ults, without even returning and retorting again?" Why yes: I verily believe the Go&s;pel Spirit would lead us into all this. "Why then, (&s;ome may &s;ay) Would&s;t thou have men to be cowards?" No, by no means. Cowards where they ought to be cowards, to be &s;ure&mdash;afraid to do evil; but magnanimous heroes, under the &s;ervice and in the &s;ervice of the glorious King, the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t! Becau&s;e the LAMB and his followers will finally obtain the victory. O then, my friends, let us with one accord add to our faith, works. It is a glorious and ble&s;&s;ed faith: But if thou add not to thy faith, works, is there a probability that thou wilt reap the glorious reward? O what is it that our ble&s;&s;ed Lord pronounced to tho&s;e that di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves with works of mercy, with works of benevo|lence, and works of peace, who lived in the peace of his divine and holy religion, which he had given them to ob|&s;erve, "Come, ye ble&s;&s;ed of my Father, inherit the king|dom prepared for you before the foundation of the world. I was &s;ick, and in pri&s;on, and ye vi&s;ited me. I was hun|gry, and ye fed me. I was naked, and ye clothed me. I was a &s;tranger, and ye took me in, to comfort me. Come, ye ble&s;&s;ed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you, from the foundation of the world."</P>
<P>Now it is this kingdom that I want you, my friends, all to inherit. To be &s;o prepared again&s;t the awful &s;ummons, which is approaching to us all, that we may look forward without di&s;may; that we may be favoured with that hope, which will be as an anchor to the &s;oul, both &s;ure and &s;tead|fa&s;t, for whatever we may have promi&s;ed to our&s;elves, in a moment that thou knowe&s;t not, "the Son of man cometh;" thy days here may be few; <HI>"du&s;t thou art, and to du&s;t thou &s;halt return!"</HI></P>
<Q><L>Earth's highe&s;t &s;tation ends in, "here he lies:"</L>
<L>And, "du&s;t to du&s;t" concludes her noble&s;t &s;ong.</L></Q>

<HEAD>The Second Di&s;cour&s;e of W. Savery.</HEAD>
<P>MY Religion teaches me this&mdash;and it is the grand ruling and fundamental point upon which I de&s;ire to re&s;t my &s;alvation: that is, to endeavour to have <HI>"a con|&s;cience void of offence, both towards God and Man."</HI></P>
<P>I de&s;ire not to offend any of my fellow-travellers in the way to the kingdom; far be it from me. I know that there is great indulgence nece&s;&s;ary one towards another. We have been variou&s;ly educated, we have had various pre|judices in our minds, and nothing but the divine illumina|ting power can make them &s;ub&s;ide &s;o as we might have charity one towards another. I believe there are &s;ome of the Lord's true Church in every name and among every nation; and that there are not only the&s;e who are profe&s;&s;ing the &s;ame faith with me, and who wor&s;hip God in &s;ilence as I do, but al&s;o in other profe&s;&s;ions there are tho&s;e who in &s;incerity of &s;oul offer up their prayers to God. This I de|&s;ire to believe wherever I may be.</P>
<P>I am here in this I&s;land at pre&s;ent: but am going to the continent of Europe. I &s;eek not my own, the Lord know|eth; nor the applau&s;e of men, nor any thing that they can give; but a quiet and peaceful con&s;cience: and that I may be made in &s;ome &s;mall degree in&s;trumental to induce &s;ome to enter into that holy bond of everla&s;ting union and har|mony which &s;hall go with us beyond the grave. This is the great and mo&s;t important work that I have now to do among you&mdash;aye, it is all&mdash;and for which I have left my peaceful home, and my endeared connections&mdash;that &s;o if po&s;&s;ible I might be an in&s;trument of uniting my fellow pro|fe&s;&s;ors. O! then, that we may look upon one another with that charity which ever ought to di&s;tingui&s;h all the followers of Chri&s;t: for I believe there may be followers of HIM in many forms that I have not particularly heard of at pre&s;ent. But through the divine mercy I believe I have found him who was typified by all the types and figures
<PB N="55" REF="032807_0052_0FF52946A3D86440">
that went before HIM, Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the Son and Sent of God: and that all men may find him to their comfort here, their peace, their &s;ettlement of mind, and their ever|la&s;ting rejoicing in the world to come.</P>
<P>Seek him then my friends impartially: enter into your clo&s;ets: do as the noble Bereans did, when they heard the doctrine which the &s;ervant of Je&s;us Chri&s;t delivered to them, they &s;earched the Scriptures diligently to &s;ee whether the&s;e things were &s;o; and the apo&s;tle &s;aid "the&s;e were more noble than tho&s;e of The&s;&s;alonica, becau&s;e when they heard the truths of the Go&s;pel they &s;earched diligently;" they did not let them pa&s;s by unnoticed, as it were in at one ear and out of the other, but &s;earched diligently to &s;ee whether the&s;e things were &s;o.</P>
<P>I believe that if this were the ca&s;e with &s;ome that are now pre&s;ent, they would indeed be made wi&s;er than &s;ome of their teachers: though I believe I have fellow-labourers in the go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, among the various profe&s;&s;ors, under every chri&s;tian name, yet I believe, and with all the charity I can attain, that there are far too many who have entered into Chri&s;t's church with &s;ini&s;ter views; that are making it a living and a competency for &s;upport in this life, more than preaching the Go&s;pel for Je&s;us Chri&s;t's &s;ake. Yet I &s;ay, I believe I have &s;ome faithful brethren in the mini&s;try, who labour with all their powers to exalt the glory of God upon the earth; and to bring people into that condition whereon they may lay hold of the kingdom of God.</P>
<P>Therefore, my friends, let no man judge me as a &s;ectarian. I wi&s;h your everla&s;ting happine&s;s: I wi&s;h all our increa&s;e in that wi&s;dom which is from above; that &s;o as we advance in years and the time draws nigh wherein we mu&s;t lay down this mortal and peri&s;hing body, we may through the mercy of God be gathered to him&s;elf, and through his love which is un&s;peakable, be with the Saints and Angels, glorifying and prai&s;ing his Name, for ever and ever, world without end.</P>
