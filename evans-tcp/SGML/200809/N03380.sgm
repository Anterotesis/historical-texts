<HEAD>THE PREFACE</HEAD>
<P>IT may po&s;&s;ibly be deemed by &s;ome, a very unaccountable Procedure for &s;uch a Junior, in this Publick Manner, to trou|ble the World with any of my Performan|ces. I confe&s;s, the Con&s;ideration of my Youth (upon which account, that may be looked upon as Arrogance in Me, which wou'd be well accepted of in another, who&s;e Time and Experience in the World had given him a greater Liberty) has been the greate&s;t Stumbling Block to my &s;elf in the Way of this Publication. But I think it ought to be remembred, that where Recommending Age is wanting, the U&s;e|fulne&s;s and Importance of the Subject offer'd to the Publick, is a &s;ufficient Pa&s;s|port, and may pa&s;s for a tolerable <HI>Impri|mature</HI>: Likewi&s;e, my Publick and Sacred Character, as a Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, may allow me, at lea&s;t, the Liberty

of being as exten&s;ively U&s;eful as I can, of pur&s;uing &s;uch Methods as have a Ra|tional Tendency to promote Mens Spiri|tual Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>But I pre&s;ume, a true Account of the Rea&s;ons of the Publication, and my Prin|cipal De&s;ign in it, will be its be&s;t Vindi|cation. It is not only de&s;igned for the benefit of &s;uch as I have no other Way of acce&s;s to, and are de&s;titute of better Helps for their In&s;truction in the&s;e great Truths of the Go&s;pel, but cheifly for the Benefit of &s;uch as are my ordinary Hearers: and &s;ure, any Mini&s;ter may endea|vour the good of tho&s;e he is related to in that Capacity, in any Method conducive thereto, without a Criminal Imputation.</P>
<P>The Di&s;cour&s;es here pre&s;ented to your View, as the Title-page informs you, are Sermons which I had before preached at <HI>Middletown,</HI> a part of my pre&s;ent charge; After I had preached them, con&s;idering the great Weight and Importance of the Doctrines contained in them, the Advan|tage and Nece&s;&s;ity of being acquainted with

And <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> Negatively, the meaning is not that he has di&s;anulled, abrogated and taken away the Law, &s;o as Believers are rendred Lawle&s;s, and no more bound to Obedience; For &s;ays the &s;ame Apo&s;tle, <HI>Chap.</HI> 3.31. <HI>Do we then make void the Law thro' faith</HI>? God forbid: yea, <HI>We e&s;tabli&s;h the Law.</HI> It's true, <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> in this &s;en&s;e, was the End of the Ceremonial Law con&s;i&s;ting of Sacrifices, Offerings, &amp;c. But the Apo&s;tle here &s;peaks of the Law in general, e&s;pecially of the Moral Law, comprized in the ten Com|mandments, and under&s;tands the <HI>End of the Law,</HI> in another &s;en&s;e, when he &s;ays, <HI>he is the End of the Law for Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI>; That is, he is &s;o the End of it as to furni&s;h the Sinner with a Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s &s;ufficient to an&s;wer the Demands of it for his Ju&s;tification This way he is the End of it; which is quite another Thing than the Aboli&s;hing of it. This <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s further evident from the Apo&s;tle's limitation, <HI>to them that believe</HI>; for n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ither B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lievers nor Unbelievers, &s;ince <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, are under any Obligation to the Ceremo|nial

Law. Again, it is plain, that the Law which the Apo&s;tle here &s;peaks of, is that Law by the obeying of which the Unbelieving <HI>Jews,</HI> in the former Ver&s;e, looked to be ju&s;tified, which was the Moral as well as the Ceremonial Law. I am not &s;aying, that the Ceremonial Law is not here at all intended, but that it is not only intended; and that <HI>by the End of it,</HI> is not meant its abrogation, otherwi&s;e than by a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence. And therefore in the next Place, po&s;itively, <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is &s;aid to be the <HI>End of the Law for Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> in re&s;pect of the Cere|monial Law, as it was in&s;tituted and de&s;igned for the End, to typifie and prefigure him in his Mediatorial Office. As his Mediatorial Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s was the End which the Wa&s;hings, Sacrifices and Incen&s;e of the Ceremonial Law pointed at and held forth. This was the mi&s;e|rable Blindne&s;s of the Unbelieving <HI>Jews,</HI> that they lean'd upon their Ceremonial Ob&s;ervances as proper Atonements for their Sins in them|&s;elves, and that their Guilt was thereby taken away. And the Apo&s;tle here Informs them, that the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is that alone by which a Sinner can be ju&s;tified, which all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he Ceremonial Blood and Incen&s;e, with many other Things of that Law only &s;ignified and pointed at. They were never de&s;igned for the Ju&s;tifi|cation of Sinners by any proper Virtue of their own, but to &s;hadow forth the great Ato|ning Sacrifice of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t: For it is not po&s;&s;ible that the blood of B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lls and of Goats &s;hould take away

Sins, Heb.</HI> 10 4. In Chri&s;t only is that Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s which can deliver the Soul from the Guilt and Condemnation of Sin, and whereby all that truly believe in him are ju&s;tified: It was not in all the Ceremonial Services of the Law; they only pointed at and referred to it in him; and thus he is the End of the Ceremonial Law for Righteou&s;ne&s;s to every one that belie|veth.</P>
<P>And then as to the Law in general, <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> may be &s;aid to be <HI>the End of the Law for Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> in two re&s;pects, 1<HI>&s;t.</HI> By an&s;wering the End for which the Law was given, by fullfilling it, and &s;o working out a Righteou&s;ne&s;s for the Ju&s;tification of tho&s;e who had broken it. The Law was given for that End, that it &s;hould be obeyed, and that Man by obeying it, &s;hould have everla&s;ting Life; Now <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;ubmitted him&s;elf to the Law, and perfectly obeyed it in what it required of the Sinner, both as to its Precept and Penalty; and by that Obedience has wrought a &s;ufficient Righteou&s;ne&s;s for Believers to obtain Eternal Life by. And &s;o when <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is &s;aid to be the <HI>End of the Law for Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> in this &s;en&s;e the meaning is, that by his Obedience which he has yielded to it, he has obtained for Sinners that End for which the Law was given, and which they &s;hould have attained by it, had man never &s;inned, but per|fectly fulfilled it, <HI>viz.</HI> Everla&s;ting Life and Happine&s;s, This is the Language and Tenor of the Law, <HI>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> man which doth the&s;e Things &s;hall

So that the End which the Law propo&s;ed to the &s;ubjects to ob|tain by it, was Eternal Life and Happine&s;s: And the Righteou&s;ne&s;s which it required, for the obtaining of this End, was a perfect obedience to it, upon the lea&s;t defect it lays the Per&s;on under condemnation, <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.10. But all mankind have wofully broken the Law of <HI>GOD</HI>; either, repre&s;entatively, in their fir&s;t Parent, or both repre&s;entatively, in him, and Per&s;onally them&s;elves; and therefore can never obtain Happine&s;s by the Law, that is, upon the Law's terms of an ab&s;olutely Perfect and Per&s;onal Obedience. Now the Lord <HI>JES&V;S</HI> has perfectly obeyed the Law, in the utmo&s;t of its demands upon the Sinner, which Obedi|ence is, by God's appointment, for a Ju&s;tifying Righteou&s;ne&s;s to tho&s;e who by Faith receive him, &s;o that thereby they obtain that Life and Happine&s;s which was at fir&s;t propo&s;ed upon the terms of the Law, but is now utterly Un|attainable that way.

<P N="2">2<HI>dly,</HI> Con&s;ider, in the Law there are two parts, <HI>viz.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s Precept, whereby it requires Obedience, and its Penalty, whereby it requires Puni&s;hment for Di&s;obedience. Now tho' <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is not the End of the Precept of the Law, &s;o as to take away the Believers Obligation to Obedience; yet, he is the End of the Penalty, Malediction and Cur&s;e of the Law, &s;o as to take

away their Obligation to puni&s;hment. He takes away the Law's Proce&s;s again&s;t them; So that it no longer requires Puni&s;hment or Satis|faction of them, he having &s;atisfied and under|gone the Penalty of the Law in their Room, and thereby furni&s;hed them with a &s;ufficient Righteou&s;ne&s;s to an&s;wer all the Charges and <HI>demands</HI> which the <HI>law</HI> has to lay in again&s;t them, as Bars in their Way to Happine&s;s and Glory. The Laws Penalty has no more to require of them; according to <HI>Gal,</HI> 3.13. <HI>Chri&s;t has redeemed us from the Cur&s;e of the Law, being made a Cur&s;e for us.</HI> And tho' the Law, as to its Precept, remains an unalterable Rule of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;o requires Obedience from Believers; yet, it is not required as the Term or Condition of their Ju&s;tification before GOD Their Ju&s;tifica|tion is put altogether upon another Foot, than it was in the Law, or Covenant of Works: The Spotle&s;s Obedience which the <HI>Lord JES&V;S</HI> paid to the Precept of the Law being accepted in the Room and Place of the Obedience requi|red by that Covenant in the ca&s;e of Ju&s;tification.</P>
<P>And thus is he the End of the Law for Righteou&s;ne&s;s to every one that believeth And here it is to be ob&s;erved, that in all the&s;e Sen&s;es, the general Scope and de&s;ign of the Words is the &s;ame, <HI>viz</HI> That the Righteou&s;|ne&s;s whereby a Sinner can only be Ju&s;tified and delivered from the Condemnation of the Law, is in <HI>JES&V;S CHRIST.</HI> To him alone the Sinner mu&s;t come for it, or be forever undone</P>

thro' <HI>the Redemption that is in JES&V;S CHRIST.</HI> 2<HI>dly</HI> God requires that Sinners comply with that Way which him&s;elf has appointed, believe in it, and depend upon it; otherwi&s;e they can|not be Ju&s;tified by it.

<P>Now, this Ignorance is &s;o de&s;tructive and pernicious upon two Accounts, 1<HI>&s;t.</HI> As it is a Crime that de&s;erves Damnation, But here you mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that this is peculiar to tho&s;e who live under the Go&s;pel, enjoying the means of Knowledge.

It is diffi|cult to &s;uch Earthly Thoughtle&s;s Souls as have never made Religion much of their &s;tudy; and yet the&s;e Per&s;ons, as if they had diligently look'd into all the Doctrines of the Go&s;pel with an Angel's Eye, pre&s;ently di&s;regard any thing they don't under&s;tand at the fir&s;t hearing.

<PB N="68" REF="004117_0078_1003B36A050B0400">
Sermon which I delivered here, I &s;how'd you that condemned State which Mankind have brought them&s;elves into by &s;in, with a particu|lar Application to Unbelievers, as their pre&s;ent State, which they &s;till continue in, while &s;uch. I &s;how'd you how they came into it, by which it is clearly evident, that all Mankind were equally under the &s;ame Condemnation, having broken God's Righteous Law, which, without re&s;pect of Per&s;ons, condemns the Breakers of it. And my de&s;ign now, from this Pa&s;&s;age of holy Scripture, is to &s;how you, the Way whereby Sinners can only be delivered out of this deplorable E&s;tate. The Method which God has provided and e&s;tabli&s;hed for that end. Now as the inherent Depravity and Wicked|ne&s;s of the Soul, the corrupt Quality and Di&s;|po&s;ition of the Sinner is Remedied by Sanctifi|cation, &s;o his Condemned State is Remedied by Ju&s;tification. It is the delivering of the Sinner from his Condemnation to Hell, and en|titling him, upon the contrary, to the Happi|ne&s;s of Heaven. I &s;hall endeavour to give you a ju&s;t View of it under this Definition, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ju&s;tification is a Judicial Act of GOD, wherein he acquits the Sinner of his Guilt, and gives him a Title to Eternal Happin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>In this Definition you may e&s;pecially ob&s;erve two things concerning Ju&s;tification. 1<HI>&s;t.</HI> The parts of it, which are Two; or, there are two
<PB N="69" REF="004117_0079_1003CFB0883DECA0">
things done for the Per&s;on in Ju&s;tification; He is freed from Guilt, and entitled to Glory. By <HI>Guilt</HI> under&s;tand the Sinner's Obligation to the Puni&s;hment of Hell, which comes by the Condemning Sentence of the Law, which he is fallen under. Now in <HI>Ju&s;tification</HI> this <HI>Condem|ning Sentence</HI> is taken off and &s;o his Liablene&s;s and Obligation to Puni&s;hment. According to <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.1. <HI>There is now no Condemnation to them that are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI> So that when a Sinner is &s;aid to be acquitted of his Guilt, ab&s;olved or deliver|ed from it, the meaning is, that the Condemning Sentence of the Law which he was under, is taken off, and he is &s;ecured again&s;t the danger of Hell's Puni&s;hment, which before he was bound over to. The Go&s;pel &s;upper&s;edes the Law, and over-rules it, as it were, &s;o as it pronounces the Per&s;on Free, who by the Law was &s;entenced to Death; thus &s;ays, the Apo&s;tle, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.2. <HI>The Law of the Spirit of Life in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, hath made me Free from the Law of Sin, and Death.</HI> And yet the Law and Go&s;pel do not oppo&s;e each other; For none are acquited by the Go&s;pel until the Laws Demands upon them, are an&s;wered; as you &s;hall farther hear, <HI>viz.</HI> by <HI>JES&V;S CHRIST</HI> for them.</P>
<P>The other part of Ju&s;tification, is the giving to the Sinner a Title and Claim to Eternal Happine&s;s. This is done for him in his Ju&s;tifi|cation; for Eternal Happine&s;s, in the Glorious Enjoyment of <HI>GOD,</HI> was at fir&s;t promi&s;ed to Man upon the Terms of the Law, the terms
<PB N="70" REF="004117_0080_1003CFB2EF782920">
of Perfect Per&s;onal Obedience, <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.5. And therefore, a Title to Life being once granted in the fir&s;t Covenant, it mu&s;t be again re&s;tored to t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e Sinner in the very Act of Ju&s;tification; becau&s;e it is a pronouncing him Free from all the Changes and Accu&s;ations of the Law, which it has to lay in again&s;t him, as Bars to the En|joyment of that happy and Eternal Life which it fir&s;t promi&s;ed. Had the Condition of the Law or fir&s;t Covenant been fulfilled, Eternal Life had thereby been obtained; and therefore, nothing can hinder any Man from the Enjoy|ment of it but the Laws objecting again&s;t him, as not having fulfilled the Condition upon which it was promi&s;ed; and &s;o, when all the Objecti|ons of the Law are an&s;wered, and the Sinner is freed from them, as fully as if he had perfor|med the Condition of the Law, a Title to Life mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be again re&s;tored.</P>
<P>In tho&s;e two things con&s;i&s;ts what is done for the Sinner in his Ju&s;tification. And hence you may ea&s;ily under&s;tand what is meant by the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages of Scripture which &s;peak of the For|givene&s;s and Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins, the blotting out of Iniquity, the covering of Sin, and the like: All which belong to the head of Ju&s;tification. The meaning is, that the Lord will look over the Sinner<HI>'s</HI> Sin, in his way of dealing with him, as to his Eternal State, as if it had never been; as if he had perf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ctly fulfilled the Law, deliver|ing him from that Puni&s;hment which his Sin expo&s;ed him to, and giving him that Titdle to
<PB N="71" REF="004117_0081_1003CFB4741CE1A0">
Life and Happine&s;s which his Sin had forfeited. From what has been &s;aid, you may al&s;o ob&s;erve, that Ju&s;tification does not con&s;i&s;t in any thing that is wrought in the Sinner, as to his Di&s;po|&s;ition and Quality; that belongs to Sanctification, but in what is done for him, re&s;pecting his State, which is what is cheifly intended when it is cal|led an Act, rather than a Work of <HI>GOD.</HI> It is nece&s;&s;ary that you con&s;ider this, and under&s;tand Wherein Ju&s;tification con&s;i&s;ts, and &s;o carry a right Notion of it along with you, through the whole of this Di&s;cour&s;e; otherwi&s;e it will be no wonder if you don't under&s;tand what may be &s;poken of it.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly.</HI> In the Definition you have the general Nature of Ju&s;tification; when it is called a <HI>Judicial Act of GOD</HI>: whereby is &s;ignified, that God proceeds in it as a Judge, pa&s;&s;ing this Ab&s;olving Sentence upon Trial, when the Per|&s;on is fir&s;t acquitted by the Law. In Ju&s;tifying a Sinner, The Lord has regard to his own Law; he will &s;ee that all the Demands which the Law has upon him, are an&s;wered, before, he will, or can Ju&s;tifie him, ju&s;tly, con&s;i&s;tently with his own Law, According to that, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.25, 26. <HI>whom GOD hath &s;et forth to be a Propitia|tion, thro' Faith in his Blood, to declare his Righteou&s;|ne&s;s for the Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins &mdash; to declare,</HI> I &s;ay, at this time, <HI>his Righteou&s;ne&s;s, that he might be ju&s;t, and the Ju&s;tifier of him that believeth in JES&V;S.</HI> In the&s;e Words the Apo&s;tle ob&s;erves the nece&s;|&s;ity of Chri&s;t<HI>'s</HI> Death for a Sinner's Ju&s;tification,

to maintain and manife&s;t God's Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Ju&s;tice, as well as his other Perfections therein: &s;o, clearly intimating, that he could not be ju&s;t in ju&s;tifying a Sinner, unle&s;s the Law had been thus &s;atisfied. God at fir&s;t conditionally annex|ed a Penalty to his Law; that in ca&s;e &s;in &s;hould be committed, it &s;hould infallibly be pu|ni&s;hed; that the Sinner &s;hould not be relieved unle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s the Penalty were fully &s;u&s;tained: This was the Method which God determined, and engaged him&s;elf to pro&s;ecute &s;in in; and there|fore, he cannot Ju&s;tifie a Sinner, ju&s;tly, without Acting contrary to his own Appointment and e&s;tabli&s;h a Law, unle&s;s the Penalty be under|gone in his behalf, by an Undertaker for him.

So that you &s;ee, all the claims of the Law mu&s;t be an&s;wered to the extent, before a Sinner can be ju&s;tified. Hence that <HI>Matt.</HI> 5, 18. <HI>Till Heaven and Earth pa&s;s, one Jot or one Tittle &s;hall in no wi&s;e pa&s;s from the Law, till all be fulfilled.</HI> The Law will not abate one jot or its Demands, but all mu&s;t be fulfilled.

<P N="2">2<HI>dly.</HI> Having &s;et before you a breif and ju&s;t View of the Nature of Ju&s;tification, I come now to &s;how you what that Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t is, thro' which alone this great Benefit can be obtained, as the Material and Meritorious Cau&s;e of it. And,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t, Negatively,</HI> It is not the e&s;&s;ential Righteou&s;ne&s;s of his Nature, whereby he is eternally Righteous, &amp; Holy. Neither, 2<HI>dly,</HI> His Righteou&s;ne&s;s in the Admini&s;tration of his e&s;&s;en|tial or Mediatorial Government which he daily exerci&s;es in the World. Nor yet, 3<HI>dly,</HI> Is it the Inherent Righteou&s;ne&s;s or Sanctification of Be|livers, which he works in them by his <HI>holy Spirit.</HI> This Righteou&s;ne&s;s indeed, is in all tho&s;e that are Ju&s;tified, &s;o as none are Ju&s;tified but they are al&s;o Sanctified and Holy: But yet their Holine&s;s and inherent Goodne&s;s is not that Righteou&s;ne&s;s by which they are ju&s;tified. It is rather the Fruit than the Cau&s;e of their Ju&s;tifica|tion. None are truly Sanctified before they are ju&s;tified: Ju&s;tification and the New Nature always go together, and its di&s;covering it &s;elf in its proper Acts immediately follows the Per|&s;on's Ju&s;tification. Hence <HI>Rom.</HI> 4.5. In Ju&s;ti|fying, God is &s;aid to Ju&s;tifie the Ungodly. A Believers Inherent Righteou&s;ne&s;s can never an&s;wer the Demands of the Law for him, and

therefore, cannot be his ju&s;tifying Righteou&s;ne&s;s. It is nece&s;&s;ary to take away the Power and Dominion of Sin in the Heart; But can never take away the Guilt of Sin.

There are &s;ome that will &s;peak very plau&s;ibly of Ju&s;tification by the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t only, but when they fully explain them&s;elves, they mean nothing el&s;e but the inherent Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Godly, which Chri&s;t works in them, upon which ac|count they call it his Righteou&s;ne&s;s: which bewrays a very great Ignorance of the Nature of Ju&s;tification.</P>

But, ala&s;s, Mankind have univer&s;ally failed in the Performance of this Condition; <HI>for all have &s;inned, and come &s;hort of the Glory of GOD, Rom.</HI> 3.23. And the Law &s;till objects again&s;t the Sinner, and holds him de&s;ti|tute of any Claim to happine&s;s, or intere&s;t in it, nay, lays an infallible Bar in the way, while its Condition is not fulfilled. Our ble&s;&s;ed Lord Je&s;us has perfectly fulfilled it, in the Di&s;charge of his Mediatorial Undertaking; and hence it is the Believers are entitled to Glory; thro' his performing the Condition of the Law, his Obedience being accepted for them: <HI>Therefore,</HI> &s;ays the Apo&s;tle, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.19. <HI>As by one Mans Di&s;obedience many were made Sinners; So by the Obedience of One &s;hall many</HI> be made Righteous, As by <HI>Adam's</HI> di&s;obedience all his Po&s;terity were look'd upon as Sinners, and &s;o deprived of all Tittle to the promi&s;ed Life; So by Chri&s;t's Obedience all Believers are look'd upon as Righteous, as if they had fulfilled the Condi|tion of the Law; and &s;o are entitled to eternal Life. Chri&s;t has an&s;wered the Condition of

the Law for them; were it not &s;o, we &s;hould all be mo&s;t undone Creatures: We &s;hould never &s;ee the Face of God in Peace. Thus I have &s;hown you that Righteou&s;ne&s;s of <HI>JES&V;S Chri&s;t,</HI> whereby he is the End of the Law, to every one that believeth. I have &s;et it before you in both its parts, an&s;wering to the two parts of a Sinner's Ju&s;tification; and pointed out to you, particularly, how the one an&s;wers the other.</P>
<P>And now I am advanced to the <HI>Third General Head propo&s;ed,</HI> which was to confirm the Truth of the Doctrine, and prove, <HI>That the only Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s which God has e&s;tabli&s;hed for the Ju&s;tifica|tion of a Condemned Sinner, is this Righteou&s;ne&s;s of his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>The Truth of this &s;ufficiently appears from what has been already &s;aid under the fore|going Head; but for the fuller Confirmation of it, I &s;hall take the Proof of it under a par|ticular Con&s;ideration by it &s;elf.</P>
<P>And to this purpo&s;e you my ob&s;erve, That the whole current of the Scripture runs this way. The whole New-Te&s;tament, wherein God has clearly revealed the Go&s;pel-Method of Salvation, very evidently flows in this Channel, attributing a Sinner's Deliverance from Con|demnation and Wrath, and his Title to Glory and Happine&s;s to the Obedience and Suffer|ings of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t alone, as the &s;ole Cau&s;e thereof. It cannot be more fully and plainly expre&s;&s;ed, than it is <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.24, 25. <HI>Be|ing

<P>Again, I &s;hall further confirm this Truth by the following Induction, <HI>viz.</HI> A Sinner

mu&s;t be ju&s;tified, either without any Con&s;ider|ation at all, to an&s;wer the Law as a Satisfaction to Ju&s;tice, or by <HI>his own Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> his Works of Obedience to the Law, or by <HI>his own Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s</HI> in Conjunction with the <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of Chri&s;t</HI>; Or by the <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t alone</HI>; But by neither of the former, therefore by the the latter.

<P><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> A Sinner cannot be ju&s;tified without any Ju&s;tification made to the Law. For, 1<HI>&s;t,</HI> That would be contrary to Gods own E&s;tabli&s;h|ment, as you have heard.

Chri&s;t to have laid down his Life, and bore &s;uch a load of Sufferings, if the great end of it could have as well been obtained without it?

<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> We can never be ju&s;tified by our own Righteou&s;ne&s;s by our exacte&s;t Obedi|ence to the divine Law.

it is evident. <HI>For the Ju&s;t &s;hall live by Faith; And the Law is not of Faith: but the Man that doth them &s;hall live in them; Chri&s;t hath redeemed us from the Cur&s;e of the Law, being made a Cur&s;e for us.</HI> How fully does the h. <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> di&s;claim all Depen|dance upon his own Righteou&s;ne&s;s, <HI>Phil.</HI> 3.8.9. when he counts all things but <HI>Dung that he might win Chri&s;t, not having his own Righteou&s;ne&s;s which is of the Law, but that which is by the Faith of Chri&s;t, the Righteou&s;ne&s;s which is of God by faith.</HI> That is, the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, which is received and depended upon by Faith.</P>

<P N="2">2<HI>dly.</HI> Altho' our obedience to God is not the Procuring Cau&s;e of our Ju&s;tification, yet it is the Way which God has appointed to &s;eek for an intere&s;t in Chri&s;t's Ju&s;tifying Righteou&s;|ne&s;s in. It is the only Way in which God has given any encouragement to Sinners to obtain Ju&s;tification, thro' the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> &s;o as that while they continue in a cour&s;e of Di&s;o|bedience, and do not humbly and heartily &s;eek for an Intere&s;t in Chri&s;t, in the Way of his Commands, they may &s;urely expect to come &s;hort of it; and &s;o peri&s;h in their Sins, It is morally impo&s;&s;ible that a Sinner &s;hould be unit|ed to Chri&s;t (without which he cannot be ju&s;tified by him) while he goes on in a cour&s;e of Oppo&s;ition to him. A Sinners Humble, Hearty and Per&s;evering Application to GOD, with a due &s;en&s;e of his pre&s;ent Undone Con|dition, for the divine Mercy thro' the Redee|mer, is the Way to come to Chri&s;t, and get an intere&s;t in his Righteou&s;ne&s;s for his Ju&s;tification: So that it is a fal&s;e Con&s;equence from the Doctrine I am confirming, <HI>That our earne&s;t Endeavour

to &s;eek God and &s;erve him, are Needle&s;s and to no Purpo&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>But further, Con&s;ider, <HI>Thirdly</HI> That all tho&s;e who are united to Chri&s;t by Faith and &s;o Ju&s;ti|fied by his Righteou&s;ne&s;s have a new Nature implanted in them, whereby they make holine&s;s their choice; their Hearts in freely and &s;weetly determined for it, and &s;et upon it, they have a very dear love for the Lord JESUS, on whom their Eyes are fixed for their Salvation; So that they want above all things to Plea&s;e and &s;erve him. Thus, the Principle and Spring of their Obedience is not a blind Expectation of procuring their Ju&s;tification by it, tho' they don't allowedly put any tru&s;t in it for that End; yet they yield to God a more full and free Obedience, from the purer Principle of a &s;incere Love which is the only true Obedience that is plea&s;ing to God: and indeed, no Per&s;on is ever truly Holy until he rejects all dependance upon his own Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and leans on Chri&s;t alone: His Obedience is never &s;incere till then; but flows from ba&s;e and &s;elfi&s;h Prin|ciples altogether. It is plain, that &s;uch as make u&s;e of the Objections I am &s;peaking to, and think they would be at no pains to &s;erve God, if thereby they could not, at le&s;t in part, be Ju&s;tified, it is plain, (I &s;ay) that they are only obeying for their own Ends, from a Principle of Self-love, and not from any Affectionate Regard or pure love to God; and &s;o their Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, which they are &s;o highly concerted

<P>Thus you &s;ee, that the Doctrine of a <HI>Sinner's Ju&s;tification thro' the Merits of JES&V;S CHRIST, and the impo&s;&s;ibility of it by his own Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> is no enemy to the practice of Holine&s;s; but is that which only advances it.</P>
<P>Again, it may be objected, that David <HI>expre&s;&s;es great Confidence in his own Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and attributes much to it, P&s;.</HI> 7.8. <HI>Judge me, O Lord, according to my Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and According to mine Integrity that is in me,</HI> And P&s;. 18.20, <HI>The LORD rewar|ded me according to my Righteou&s;ne&s;s, according to the cleanne&s;s of my Hands hath he recompen&s;ed me.</HI> But <HI>David</HI> in the&s;e Places is not &s;peaking of the Ju&s;tification of his Per&s;on before God, as it that were the Effect of his Righteou&s;ne&s;s; but of God's Kindne&s;&s;es to him in the cour&s;e of his Providence; e&s;pecially, in delivering him from his unju&s;t Enemies, and exalting him above them. This is what he means by <HI>being rewarded according to his Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> And by <HI>his Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s</HI> he, particularly, means his Righteou&s;ne&s;s in the cau&s;e between him and his Enemies, that he had given them no ju&s;t Provocation, and in a meek becoming manner he had bore all their unju&s;t and cruel Treatment. And &s;o, in the 7<HI>th P&s;alm</HI> (which was compo&s;ed on the account of the wicked Words of <HI>Cu&s;h</HI> the <HI>Benjaminites</HI> again&s;t him, as you may &s;ee in the Title pre|fixed to the <HI>P&s;alm</HI>) he prays that God would, Judicially, in a way of Ju&s;tice interpo&s;e between

all his Hope, and the Foundation of his Confi|dence towards God.</P>
<P>From tho&s;e Things you may &s;ee the Rea&s;on, why this Grace is &s;o frequently in Scripture expre&s;&s;ed by the terms of <HI>Knowing, believing,</HI> and ordinarily by this Name of <HI>Faith,</HI> which properly &s;ignifies the <HI>Believing of &s;ome Doctrinal Propo&s;ition</HI>; and not only by the terms of, <HI>leaning, depending, tru&s;ting,</HI> &amp;c. The Rea&s;on is, becau&s;e it con&s;i&s;ts in a knowing and certain Belief of the Go&s;pel-Revelation of the Way of Salvation thro' Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;ne&s;s, together with the Souls free and affectionate Compliance with it's And in this Faith, the Soul nece&s;&s;arily receives Chri&s;t for his Saviour, and re&s;ts upon him.</P>
<P>Hence al&s;o, you may &s;ee, that &s;uch as are not firmly per&s;waded of the Truth of the great Foundation Truths of the Go&s;pel (particularly, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e which I have &s;how'd you, the Soul, in believing, gives its hearty a&s;&s;ent to) much more &s;uch as po&s;itively deny and misbelieve them, have no true Faith in Chri&s;t; for it is by the Believing of tho&s;e that the Soul comes to clo&s;e wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h the Lord JESUS, and to put a &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ng Tru&s;t and Affiance in him; and without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> he cannot, it is impo&s;&s;ible.

be far from venturing to lay down their Lives upon the Truth of them. It is evident that the Faith of &s;uch Per&s;ons is nothing el&s;e but a doubtful Opinion: whereas the Language of true.

<P N="2">2<HI>dly.</HI> Having thus far opened the Nature of Saving Faith, I am next to &s;how you, that this is the true Notion of it taught in the holy Scriptures; that this is the Faith which GOD requires in his Word.

And this is &s;aving Faith, called, the <HI>Faith of Adherence</HI> or <HI>Dependance only,</HI> being &s;hort of a bright and full A&s;&s;urance; yet it has very precious and &s;weet Effects: It cau&s;es the Soul to dart out the beams of a pure and tran&s;cendant Love to the Glorious God: It Introduces a &s;weet Joy into the Soul, and brings a balmy Peace to the wounded Con&s;cience, in proportion to the degree of Faith and Tru&s;t which the Soul re|po&s;es in Je&s;us Chri&s;t.

<P>Thus, I have laid before you the Nature of a true and &s;aving Faith: and from what has been &s;aid upon it, you may conceive how humble, low and ba&s;e in his own &s;ight a true Believer is: How deeply &s;en&s;ible of his Wretchedne&s;s and Poverty in him&s;elf.

<P><PB N="110" REF="004117_0122_1003D05607F51818">2<HI>dly.</HI> I proceed to &s;how you the nece&s;&s;ity of faith in Chri&s;t, in order to Ju&s;tification thro' his Righteou&s;ne&s;s. That it is indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;|&s;ary to this End, is beyond di&s;pute with all that under&s;tand and believe the Scriptures. But I am to con&s;ider upon what account it is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary: what is the concern which it has in the Ju&s;tifi|cation of a Sinner, upon the account of which he cannot be ju&s;tified without it. Here then you mu&s;t know that Faith is not concerned in Ju&s;tification, as a Qualification that is any Way meritorious of it: Nothing has any Hand or part in Ju&s;tification, as a Merit or Price, but the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Lord JESUS, as I have &s;ufficiently made arpear, which is &s;o full and &s;ufficient that nothing el&s;e is nece&s;&s;ary this way. To Chri&s;t belongs the whole honour and prai&s;e of the Purcha&s;e of Salvation. But Faith is concerned in Ju&s;tification, as the Hand or In|&s;trument which receives the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, and applies it to the Soul, according to the wi&s;e Con&s;titution and Appointment of God in the Go&s;pel. Upon this account it is &s;o ne|ce&s;&s;ary to Ju&s;tification. By Faith the Soul lays hold on Chri&s;t for its Saviour; and as the Belie|ver receives Chri&s;t and depends upon his Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, the Lord then imputes his Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s him; that is, he receives it for him, and accepts him upon the account of it, as fully as if he had produced a Righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;ufficient of his own. The Lord now looks upon it as the Believer's Righ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eou&s;ne&s;s, he having laid

And indeed, it can|not in rea&s;on be expected that any &s;hould be benefited by the Go&s;pel-Method of Grace and Salvation without their hearty Compliance with it: The Lord will &s;ave none in any way again&s;t their Wills; and none do con&s;ent and agree to this Way of Salvation thro' Chri&s;t, which God has appointed, until they embrace Chri&s;t, and clo&s;e with him by Faith, but are &s;till for being &s;aved &s;ome other Way&punc; But, <HI>O Sirs,</HI> there is no other Way in which you can be &s;aved; and therefore, if you agree not unfeignedly to this, you are eternally Undone.

And as upon con&s;ideration of the bare non-performance of the Condition of Life, Man is &s;hut out of Heaven, and deprived of a a glorious Immortality by this fir&s;t Covenant; &s;o, upon con&s;ideration of his tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the Law of GOD, he is by the Law, according to the tenor of this Covenant, condemned to that po&s;itive Puni&s;hment which his Sin de&s;erves, which is very dreadful and un&s;peakable, and which mu&s;t be &s;u&s;tained. Now Man is utterly incapable to an&s;wer the&s;e Demands of the Law for his Recovery; and there is no other Creature able to an&s;wer the Law for him, nor willing to undertake it: Which Way then &s;hall the Law be an&s;wered, and yet the Sinner relieved? He can not an&s;wer it him&s;elf any other Way

than by &s;uffering Eternally: And &s;uppo&s;ing he could in a limited duration bear all that po&s;itive Puni&s;hment which the Law doomed him to, for his Sin, yet he could have no acce&s;s to the glorious everla&s;ting Enjoyment of GOD; becau&s;e he had failed in his Obedience, and not fulfilled the Condition upon which this happi|ne&s;s was promi&s;ed: O then how &s;hall both the Law be an&s;wered, and the poor Sinner &s;aved! Would not this one Que&s;tion have put the whole Creation to &s;ilence? and eternally Non-plus'd the highe&s;t reach of Creature-Thought? The Re&s;olution of it exceeds the utmo&s;t bounds of all Creature-Invention. It would appear utterly impo&s;&s;ible that the Law could be an&s;wered any other way than by the Sinners falling a Sacrifice to vindictive Ju&s;tice. But, <HI>O Sirs,</HI> behold and admire the a&s;toni&s;hing Wi&s;dom of <HI>Jehovah,</HI> whereby he has made fooli&s;h the Wi&s;dom of the World: The Second Per&s;on in the glorious Godhead, the eternal Son of God, who is God equal with the Father, takes upon him our Nature, a human body and Soul into a Per&s;onal Union with him&s;el<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and thereby becomes capable of fulfilling the Law which Sinners had broken, and bearing its awful Penalty; and the infinite Dignity of his Per&s;on adds an infinite Value to his Mediation; So that the Law is fully an&s;wered in the utmo&s;t of its Demands, and a door of Hope opened for Guilty and Wretched Creatures.

Again, the un&s;potted Holine&s;s and inflexible Ju&s;tice of God are clearly manife&s;ted in this Method of Salvation: Therein he has te&s;tified the dreadful de&s;ert of Sin, and his infinite Abhorrence of it; rather than it &s;hould go unpuni&s;hed, he would puni&s;h it in his own dear Son; &amp; &s;o he has main|tained the Honour and awful Re&s;pect due to his Royal Law.
