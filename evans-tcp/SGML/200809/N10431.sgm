<OPENER><SALUTE>Friends, Countrymen, and Fellow-Subjects!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"OUR civil government (&s;ays an excellent Engli&s;h Writer) is happily placed be|tween the two extremes of <HI>de&s;potic pow|er</HI> and <HI>popular licentiou&s;ne&s;s:</HI> it is wi&s;ely compo&s;ed of &s;uch a due mixture of the &s;everal &s;imple forms of go|vernment, tho&s;e of one, of a few, and of many, as to retain as far as po&s;&s;ible the advantages, and to ex|clude the inconveniencies, peculiar to each; and the parts are &s;o nicely combined and adju&s;ted, that the &s;everal powers co-operate and move on together in concert and agreement, mutually tempering, limiting, and re&s;training, yet at the &s;ame time aiding, &s;upport|ing, and &s;trengthening each other."</P>
<P>This frame of government, for the admirable wi&s;|dom of its &s;tructure, has always been the wonder of the world; and under its protection and mild influ|ence, the &s;ubjects of Great Britain are the happie&s;t people on earth. But of all the &s;ubjects of Great Britain, tho&s;e who re&s;ide in the American Colonies have been, and, were they &s;en&s;ible of their own ad|vantages, might &s;till be, by far the happie&s;t: &s;ur|rounded with the ble&s;&s;ings of peace, health, and ne|ver-failing plenty&mdash;enjoying the benefits of an equi|table and free con&s;titution&mdash;&s;ecured by the protec|tion and patronage of the greate&s;t maritime power in the world&mdash;and contributing, in but a &s;mall propor|tion, to the &s;upport of the nece&s;&s;ary public expences.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="013224_0003_0F8FB55A2C6D13D0" MS="y">Under the&s;e advantages, the colonies have hither|to flouri&s;hed beyond example. They have become populous, both by natural increa&s;e, and the yearly influx of foreigners, the &s;ure indications of a happy country; and they have become rich, by practicing, at their ea&s;e, the peaceful arts of agriculture and commerce. And were they to pur&s;ue the &s;ame path which has brought them thus far, there is no doubt but they would go on to flouri&s;h and pro&s;per in the &s;ame proportion, till, in proce&s;s of time, they would exite either the admiration or envy of the whole hu|man race. The advice therefore of MOSES to a peo|ple highly favoured of Heaven, is ju&s;tly applicable to them; and nothing could be wanting to their hap|pine&s;s, but hearts to follow it,
<Q>Only <HI>take heed to thy&s;elf,</HI> &s;ays he, and keep thy &s;oul diligently, le&s;t thou forget the things which thine eyes have &s;een, and le&s;t they depart from thine heart, all the days of thy life.</Q></P>
<P>But a far different pro&s;pect, at this time, pre&s;ents it|&s;elf to view. The darkne&s;s of a ri&s;ing tempe&s;t is be|ginning to over&s;pread our land. The thunder roars at a di&s;tance, and appears to be &s;wiftly approaching. It is high time therefore to awaken the thoughtle&s;s to a &s;en&s;e of their danger, and to think of providing for our common &s;afety.</P>
<P>There is, there can be, but one way to prevent the ruin that threatens us. Our own mi&s;conduct has brought it forward; and our immediate reformation mu&s;t &s;top it progre&s;s. He mu&s;t be blind, that is not convinced of this; and he mu&s;t be infatuated, that will pur&s;ue the road, which evidently terminates in darkne&s;s and de&s;truction.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="013224_0004_0F8FB55B2BDD2428">Whether the Briti&s;h Parliament has been right or wrong in its late proceedings, towards the Colonies; our behaviour has been &s;uch as every government mu&s;t and will think intolerable. If the &s;upreme power of any kingdom or &s;tate, through want of due information or attention, &s;hould adopt mea&s;ures that are wrong or oppre&s;&s;ive, the &s;ubjects may complain and remon&s;trate again&s;t them in a re&s;pectful manner; but they are bound, by the laws of Heaven and Earth, not to behave undutifully, much more not to behave in&s;olently and rebelliou&s;ly. The bands of &s;ociety would be di&s;&s;olved, the harmony of the world con|founded, and the order of nature &s;ubverted, if re|verence, re&s;pect, and obedience, might be refu&s;ed to tho&s;e whom the con&s;titution has ve&s;ted with the high|e&s;t authority. The ill con&s;equences of open di&s;re|&s;pect to government are &s;o great, that no mi&s;conduct of the admini&s;tration can ju&s;tify or excu&s;e it. The guilt of it is &s;o aggravated, that Chri&s;tians are requir|ed, under the heavie&s;t penalty to avoid it, and to be <HI>&s;ubject to the higher powers,</HI> of whatever character, <HI>for con&s;cience's &s;ake.</HI> No tyrant was ever more de&s;potic and cruel, than <HI>Nero,</HI> and no Court ever more cor|rupted than his; and yet to the government of this cruel and de&s;potic tyrant, and his corrupt mini&s;try, peaceable &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion was enjoined by an Apo&s;tle, who had a due regard for the rights and liberties of mankind. To di&s;turb or threaten an e&s;tabli&s;hed go|vernment, by popular in&s;urrections and tumults, has always been con&s;idered and treated, in every age and nation of the world, as an unpardonable crime: and were we the &s;ubjects of the <HI>Grand Turk,</HI> it is as cer|tain that we ought not to encourage &s;uch practices, as that St. Paul and St. Peter, who condemned them, were in&s;pired men.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="013224_0005_0F90450F560252B8">But my de&s;ign is not to con&s;ider, how far the con|duct of the Colonies is, or is not, conformable to the rules and precepts of the Chri&s;tian religion; but, how far it is to be condemned or ju&s;tified by the maxims of &s;ound policy and prudence. Our tem|poral intere&s;t and &s;afety are con&s;iderations which all will regard, how much &s;oever they may &s;light or de|&s;pi&s;e the obligations of religion.</P>
<P>The voice of complaint, to call it no wor&s;e, is now heard through every corner of our land; and we are daily exhorted to prepare for the defence of our li|berties, and all that is &s;acred, with united efforts.&mdash; But before we proceed, it concerns us to be well in|formed, both as to our real danger, and the &s;teps proper to be taken</P>
<P>Were the Americans actually in a &s;tate of oppre&s;|&s;ion, it would &s;hew their wi&s;dom and prudence, to &s;ubmit with patience to their pre&s;ent condition, rather than to provoke the power that oppre&s;&s;es them, without &s;ome fair pro&s;pect of obtaining relief. One degree of di&s;tre&s;s, in con&s;equence of the weight of illegal power, is a grievance; ten degrees of di&s;tre&s;s are proportionably a greater evil; but bad as it is, he mu&s;t be an idiot or a madman, who would not prefer them to twenty. But it appears to me that, of all people under heaven, the King's &s;ubjects in America, have hitherto had the lea&s;t ground for com|plaint; and that the pre&s;ent confu&s;ion of the Colo|nies has been occa&s;ioned by mi&s;informations and fal&s;e alarms. If none of our <HI>legal</HI> rights have been invad|ed, no injury has been done us; if we have not been injured, we have no room for complaint; and we can never be ju&s;tified in re&s;enting that, which it would be unrea&s;onable to complain of.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="013224_0006_0F8FB55F0C4962C0" MS="y">My <HI>Friends, Countrymen, and Fellow Subjects!</HI> &s;uffer, for a few minutes, an American, one who has often gloried in the title, who loves his country as much, and has as great a regard for its honour, as any of you, to rea&s;on and expo&s;tulate with you, in plain language, on a &s;ubject now of the highe&s;t im|portance, both to you and him.</P>
<P>You are taught to exclaim loudly again&s;t
<Q>the arbitrary proceedings of the Briti&s;h Parliament.</Q>
But con&s;ider; wherein have they been arbitrary, and in what do you &s;uffer? Why, it &s;eems,
<Q>a duty of three pence a pound, has been laid, by Parliament, upon their teas exported to America; and we can|not purcha&s;e the tea, without paying the duty.</Q>
But if this may be called a burden, &s;o may the weight of an atom on the &s;houlders of a giant: be&s;ides, this burden may be ea&s;ily avoided; for we have no occa|&s;ion to purcha&s;e the tea, and unle&s;s we purcha&s;e it, we are under no obligations to pay the duty.</P>
<P>You will &s;ay:
<Q>the Parliament had <HI>no right</HI> to lay the duty.</Q>
But I &s;uppo&s;e we are, mo&s;t of us, but indifferent judges of the rights of Parliament; or however, the Parliament mu&s;t act according to their own judgment, and not according to ours, if it be different from theirs. They a&s;&s;ert, and believe, that they have the right in que&s;tion; and we have never proved that they have not. Nay, we our&s;elves have always believed and allowed that they have it, till the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion. I might add, that we have always allowed that they had a right to regulate not only the trade, but all concerns of the Colonies; &s;uch a power they have always exerci&s;ed, and we have &s;ubmitted to their acts. Thus, for in&s;tance, we have paid a duty on wine and mola&s;&s;es, in obedience to Parliament, and without prote&s;tations or remon&s;tran|ces; and, for the &s;ame rea&s;ons, we are as much ob|liged
<PB N="8" REF="013224_0007_0F8FB55FD5BA7830">
to pay the duty on tea. If we would act con|&s;i&s;tently, we &s;hould either refu&s;e to pay the duty on wine and mola&s;&s;es, or con&s;ent to pay it on tea; for it is, in both ca&s;es, impo&s;ed from the &s;ame principle, and has the &s;ame effect.</P>
<P>Perhaps it will be replied,
<Q>The&s;e and all other duties ought to be rejected, becau&s;e they are <HI>pre|cedents,</HI> and intended to prepare the way for high|er demands; and if Parliament has a right to take from us one penny, without our con&s;ent, it has a right to &s;trip us of our whole property, and to make us ab&s;olute &s;laves.</Q></P>
<P>This, I believe, is the fir&s;t time that a &s;overeign power has been in want of <HI>precedents,</HI> to ju&s;tify its making laws to govern any part of its dominions. It is a contradiction in the nature of things, and as ab&s;urd as that a part &s;hould be greater than the whole, to &s;uppo&s;e that the &s;upreme legi&s;lative power of any Kingdom does not extend to the utmo&s;t bounds of that kingdom. If the&s;e Colonies, which originally belonged to <HI>England,</HI> are not now to be regulated and governed by the authority of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> then the con&s;equences are plain; they are not dependant upon <HI>Great Britain</HI>&mdash;they are not included within its territories&mdash;they are no part of its dominions&mdash; the inhabitants are not Engli&s;h, they can have no claim to the privileges of Engli&s;hmen; they are, with regard to <HI>England,</HI> foreigners and aliens; nay, wor&s;e, as they have never been legally di&s;charged from the duty they owed it, they are rebels and apo|&s;tates. On the above &s;uppo&s;ition, they are, at be&s;t; as much the dominions of <HI>Denmark</HI> or <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia,</HI> as of <HI>Great Britain</HI>; for there can be no difference in this ca&s;e, unle&s;s one has an authority over them, which the others have not. But if <HI>Great Britain</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es
<PB N="9" REF="013224_0008_0F8FB56045C3CCB0">
a &s;overeignty over the Colonies, &s;he certainly has a right, at lea&s;t, to regulate our commerce; and e&s;pe|cially to regulate the importation of &s;uch articles of mere luxury, as we can choo&s;e whether we will be concerned with, or not, with but little inconvenience to our&s;elves. Now the pre&s;ent duty on tea is exactly &s;uch a regulation.</P>
<P>You allow that this duty is a thing that is but trifl|ing in it&s;elf; but then you conceit that you ought to oppo&s;e it, becau&s;e it is a <HI>precedent,</HI> which hereafter may be u&s;ed to your di&s;advantage. I am &s;orry to &s;ee that men can be &s;o ea&s;ily deluded by &s;uch &s;ophi&s;try. Can you imagine that Parliament will not do what|ever they think right to be done by them, without waiting for <HI>Precedents?</HI> Yet precedents of their own for regulating the trade of the Colonies, are not wanting. Every reign, &s;ince the &s;ettlement of the Colonies has produced them; in con&s;equence of which you are daily paying duties that, in every view, are as liable to exception, as the duty on tea. From hence it is evident, that you your&s;elves have no incli|nation to be governed by precedent, whatever regard the Parliament may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have for them.</P>
<P>As to the argument that,
<Q>If Parliament has a right to take from us one penny, without our con|&s;ent, it has a right to &s;trip us of our whole pro|perty;</Q>
altho' &s;o great a man as Mr. LOCKE was the father of it, it appears to me to be weak and &s;ophi&s;|tical. A right to do what is rea&s;onable, implies not a right to do what is unrea&s;onable. A father may have a right over his &s;on, &s;o far as to &s;end him on an errand, or upon any rea&s;onable &s;ervice, without hav|ing &s;uch an ab&s;olute authority as can oblige him to throw him&s;elf down a precipice, or to hang him&s;elf. In like manner, ca&s;es may happen, in which it would
<PB N="10" REF="013224_0009_0F8FB560F67A26D8">
be rea&s;onable for Parliament to take from us &s;ome &s;mall matter, though we were unwilling to part with it; but the ca&s;e can hardly be &s;uppo&s;ed, in which it would be rea&s;onable to take from us every thing, unle&s;s we &s;hould have forfeited it. Every &s;ociety has a right to make a moderate u&s;e of its power over its own members, but not to abu&s;e it. There can be no right to do what is unque&s;tionably <HI>wrong.</HI></P>
<P>But you will &s;ay, it is <HI>wrong</HI> to tax us at all, <HI>with|out our con&s;ent.</HI> But the duty on tea, which has oc|ca&s;ioned all our confu&s;ions, is not &s;uch a tax; for unle&s;s you con&s;ent to the tax, you are not to pay the duty. You may refu&s;e it, if you plea&s;e, without in|curring any penalty, or con&s;iderable inconvenience. As to &s;uch taxes as ari&s;e from the general regulation of American commerce, they mu&s;t be impo&s;ed with|out our formal con&s;ent, if they are impo&s;ed at all. For if all the Colonies mu&s;t be con&s;ulted, and all mu&s;t agree, before &s;uch a regulation can take place; it is ea&s;y to fore&s;ee, that nothing of this kind can be e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, as nothing can be propo&s;ed, in which all the Colonies, having each its peculiar views and intere&s;ts, would be likely to agree. Therefore <HI>Great Britain</HI> mu&s;t either impo&s;e &s;uch duties upon our imports and exports, as may be thought proper for the good of the whole community, without our con&s;ent, or &s;he mu&s;t not attempt to regulate our trade; and if &s;he is not to &s;uperintend and regulate our trade, &s;he had better relingui&s;h at once her claim of authority over her colonies; after which they cannot expect to en|joy her protection.</P>
<P>But you further object, that
<Q>if we are to be bound by laws to which we have never con&s;ented, we have not the rights of Engli&s;hmen.</Q>
In an&s;wer
<PB N="11" REF="013224_0010_0F8FB561B074B578">
to this, let me remind you, fir&s;t of all, that it never was, nor can it be, the right of Engli&s;hmen to be ex|empted from the authority of an Engli&s;h or Briti&s;h Parliament. It is not a <HI>proper</HI> con&s;ent to the laws enacted by the Briti&s;h Parliament, but the being <HI>bound</HI> by tho&s;e laws, that di&s;tingui&s;hes a Briti&s;h &s;ub|ject from a foreigner. So long as a man re&s;ides with|in any dominions, he is a &s;ubject of it, and is oblig|ed to &s;ubmit to its laws, as far as they concern him, whether he approves of them or not. There are many people in England, who are natives of the country, that do not con&s;ent to acts of Parliament that are pa&s;&s;ed, unle&s;s by a bare <HI>fiction of the law</HI>; which can make a <HI>nominal</HI> con&s;ent, but <HI>not a real</HI> one. This is always the ca&s;e of the Minority, where there is a divi&s;ion, who&s;e votes are over-ruled by the major part; for the law nece&s;&s;arily pa&s;&s;es, not only with|out, but contrary to, their con&s;ent.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, there are millions of people re&s;iding in <HI>England,</HI> who have no votes in elections, and are ne|ver con&s;ulted about the expediency of laws. I hope the&s;e are all Engli&s;hmen, although they give no other con&s;ent to acts of Parliament, to which they are bound to &s;ubmit, than what is implied in their freely re&s;iding within the juri&s;diction and protection of Parliament. In this &s;en&s;e, the Americans, by fixing them&s;elves, and continuing to re&s;ide, within the Bri|ti&s;h dominions, con&s;ent to be governed by the Briti&s;h laws. When the Coloni&s;ts fir&s;t &s;ettled on Engli&s;h American ground, they well knew that the authority of Parliament was not to be &s;u&s;pended or withdrawn, in their favour; and they knew too, that they had no power of &s;ending repre&s;entatives to Parliament of their own choo&s;ing. <HI>On the&s;e terms</HI> they willingly &s;ettled here; and they have always enjoyed every
<PB N="12" REF="013224_0011_0F8FB5628D5AC320">
advantage which they originally expected to receive, and which was contracted for in their &s;tipulation with the Crown, and they can have no ju&s;t rea&s;on to complain on this account. Yet notwith&s;tanding all this, they have been lately told by their agents, who had it from the be&s;t authority, that if they cho&s;e to &s;end over per&s;ons to repre&s;ent them in Parliament, they &s;hould be admitted to &s;eats in the Hou&s;e. In my opinion, they have done wi&s;ely in not accepting of the offer; but after refu&s;ing it, they have &s;urely no rea&s;on to complain, that they have no repre&s;entatives in the Parliament that mu&s;t govern them.</P>
<P>It has been frequently a&s;&s;erted, in ju&s;tification of your claim, that,
<Q>as the charters granted by the Crown, have allowed a legi&s;lative authority to the &s;everal Colonies, the inhabitants are to be bound by no laws, but what are made by their re&s;pective provincial legi&s;latures, to which they con&s;ent by repre&s;entation.</Q>
With regard to this doctrine, I beg leave only to a&s;k a few que&s;tions. Can you be made to believe, that it was ever the intention of the Crown, to e&s;tabli&s;h by charter a power of legi&s;lation, in any of the Colonies, that is &s;overeign, independent, and incontrolable by the &s;upreme authority of the nation? Can you imagine, that in any in&s;tance, more than a <HI>&s;ubordinate</HI> right of juri&s;diction was meant, for the internal regulation of the di&s;trict mentioned in the charter; or conceive that &s;uch a grant can place you beyond the reach of parliamentary autho|rity? Would not the arguments that perhaps have deceived you, prove as &s;trongly, that the charter of the city of <HI>Albany,</HI> granting a power to make laws for its internal regulation, <HI>provided they are not con|trary to the laws of the Province,</HI> places the inhabi|tants of that city beyond the reach of laws made by the a&s;&s;embly of <HI>New-York?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="013224_0012_0F8FB563E0388518">You, one and all, talk of your rights by charter: but are not &s;ome of the Colonies without charters? And do all the charters convey exactly the &s;ame privileges and rights? Do any of them &s;ay, that you &s;hall not be bound by laws made in Great Britain? Nay, does not the charter of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> &s;ay ex|pre&s;sly, that <HI>taxes</HI> may be laid upon the inhabitants <HI>by act of Parliament?</HI> None therefore have a right to plead their charters, in the pre&s;ent controver&s;y, with the mother country, who re&s;ide in the colonies that are without charters, or in Penn&s;ylvania; and it is high time for tho&s;e who re&s;ide in the other colo|nies, to furni&s;h &s;ome kind of evidence, that their charters give <HI>them</HI> the right for which they contend. They have not yet done this; they have not attempted to do it; I &s;u&s;pect they never will attempt it; and I challenge them to do it if they can. You may have heard &s;ome of them <HI>declaim</HI> on this topic, and you may hear them again; but, if you expect the <HI>proof</HI> called for, you will be di&s;appointed.</P>
<P>What has been offered is in order to &s;hew, that, in reality, no proper <HI>right</HI> of the colonies is infringed by the late act of Parliament, that impo&s;es a &s;mall duty on the teas exported to America. And here it is worthy of notice, and we ought to attend to it all along as we proceed, that the colonies of <HI>Rhode-I&s;land, Connecticut, New-York, New-Jer&s;ey, Penn&s;yl|vania, Maryland, Virginia,</HI> the <HI>Carolinas</HI> and <HI>Georgia,</HI> are not affected by any other of the late acts of Parliament; and have no di&s;pute of their own with the mother country, but what ari&s;es from the tea-act.</P>
<P>But let us now <HI>&s;uppo&s;e,</HI> that we have been really injured by this act; and that our paying the duty would be dangerous to our con&s;titutional liberties.
<PB N="14" REF="013224_0013_0F8FB563F1E65290" MS="y">
On this &s;uppo&s;ition, which the Americans in general &s;eem to have adopted as the true &s;tate of the ca&s;e, the great que&s;tion is,&mdash;<HI>What method the colonies ought in wi&s;dom to pur&s;ue, in order to get rid of the duty?</HI></P>
<P>Different mea&s;ures have been already taken, in the different colonies, to avoid the operation of the act. In <HI>South-Carolina,</HI> the obnoxious tea was landed; but the inhabitants formed a re&s;olution, to which they have the virtue punctually to adhere, not to pur|cha&s;e it. Happy would it have been for the colo|nies, if this mea&s;ure had been univer&s;ally taken! In that ca&s;e, we &s;hould &s;till have enjoyed tranquility, uninterrupted by &s;editious alarms; and the black cloud, charged with &s;torm and thunder, that now darkens our land, would not have collected.</P>
<P>In mo&s;t of the other colonies, the tea was not &s;uffered to enter their ports; but it was &s;ent back unhurt. This indeed, in all its circum&s;tances, mu&s;t be con&s;idered as a kind of in&s;ult upon government; but yet it was &s;uch a &s;pecies of mi&s;behaviour, as, in all probability, the nation would have overlooked, and many of the friends of America would have thought worthy of commendation. But, as the evil genius of the colonies would have it, the tea that was &s;ent to <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> was neither &s;tored, nor &s;ent back, but outrageou&s;ly de&s;troyed by the hands of violence.</P>
<P>Whatever may be thought of con&s;igning, or &s;ending back the tea, there are but few people &s;o abandoned to all &s;entiments of fitne&s;s, propriety, and ju&s;tice, as to think the de&s;truction of it excu&s;e|able; and the government at home, as all govern|ments would in the like ca&s;e, thought it un&s;uffera|ble.&mdash;It was &s;oon determined, to inflict an exemplary puni&s;hment upon the town that was guilty of &s;uch
<PB N="15" REF="013224_0014_0F8FB564AB27F558">
&s;hameful and flagrant inju&s;tice; and an act was pa&s;&s;ed, for &s;hutting up the port of <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> till pro|per &s;atisfaction &s;hould be made for &s;o provoking an outrage.</P>
<P>It is certain, that all the Americans are out of the reach of this act; that it was not intended to affect them; and therefore that they have nothing immediately to do with it, excepting the inhabitants of <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> them&s;elves. Accordingly I &s;hould have pa&s;&s;ed it by, as foreign from <HI>our</HI> part of the di&s;pute, had it not been voted by all our county and provin|cial COMMITTEES, to be <HI>dangerous to the liberties of the Briti&s;h colonies.</HI> For this rea&s;on I &s;hall offer &s;ome ob&s;ervations on what appears to have been the policy of the act; which I &s;hall addre&s;s to tho&s;e only, who are &s;o rea&s;onable and mode&s;t as to allow, that the tea ought not to have been de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>If the conduct of the Bo&s;tonians, in de&s;troying the tea, was criminal, it de&s;erved puni&s;hment; and puni&s;hments &s;hould always be regulated by the na|ture and degree of the crimes for which they are inflicted, and the circum&s;tances that attended the commi&s;&s;ion of them. Now the crime of the Bo&s;to|nians was a compound of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t injury and in&s;ult. It was an act of the highe&s;t in&s;olence to|wards government; &s;uch as mildne&s;s it&s;elf cannot overlook or forgive. The inju&s;tice of the deed was al&s;o mo&s;t atrocious: as it was the de&s;truction of pro|perty to a va&s;t amount, when it was known that the nation was obliged in honour to protect it. At the &s;ame time it was very notorious, that the inten|tion of the perpetrators was, by this example, to lead and excite others, when the expected opportu|nity &s;hould pre&s;ent, to the &s;ame wanton exce&s;s of riot and licentiou&s;ne&s;s. Under the&s;e circum&s;tances,
<PB N="16" REF="013224_0015_0F8FB5671624DE78">
&s;ound policy was thought to require, that both a &s;evere and a &s;peedy puni&s;hment &s;hould be inflicted&mdash; &s;evere, that it might bear &s;ome proportion to the guilt; and &s;peedy, that it might prevent the like mi&s;chief in other in&s;tances.</P>
<P>Many, I know, who admit that Bo&s;ton ought to have been puni&s;hed, yet exclaim loudly again&s;t the puni&s;hment decreed by Parliament, as being too &s;evere in its manner: And if any other puni&s;hment had been inflicted, many of them, I dare &s;ay, would have exclaimed &s;till. For when people are once di&s;affected towards an admini&s;tration, whether with or without ju&s;t rea&s;on, they will always find &s;ome pretence for blaming any mea&s;ure that can be taken by it.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>&s;everity</HI> of the puni&s;hment in que&s;tion, it was no more than &s;hutting up a port, till &s;ati&s;|faction &s;hould be made for a flagrant injury and in&s;ult, of which it had been guilty. While this re|&s;traint was laid, a free u&s;e of all the neighbouring ports was allowed; &s;o that no people but the inha|bitants of the town of <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> were intended to be puni&s;hed by this act; and a &s;ufficient time was in|dulged <HI>them</HI> to remove all their ve&s;&s;els out of their harbour, that they might be u&s;efully employed dur|ing the re&s;traint of their port. And as &s;oon as compen&s;ation &s;hould be made for the injury done, and a proper acknowledgment of the offence com|mitted, every appearance &s;hews that government intended to be &s;atisfied, and to remove the puni&s;h|ment. For provi&s;ion was made, that, on &s;uch an event, the King might immediately &s;u&s;pend the ope|ration of the act, without waiting for the meeting, or the formal proceedings of the Parliament, which might require time. Surely none, who have as high
<PB N="17" REF="013224_0016_0F8FB567DCCDA840">
a &s;en&s;e of public guilt, as of private, can think this puni&s;hment too &s;evere for the crime, con&s;idered under all its aggravations. For, no people are en|titled to the u&s;e of any advantage, which they wan|tonly abu&s;e to the injury of others.</P>
<P>An outcry is al&s;o made, that
<Q>the puni&s;hment of the <HI>Bo&s;tonians</HI> was ha&s;ty and precipitant, offering no alternative, and not &s;uffering the party to be heard.</Q>
It is freely confe&s;&s;ed that, in common ca&s;es, none ought to be puni&s;hed without a regular trial and conviction. But here the ca&s;e was uncom|mon and extraordinary. The mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential rights of government were audaciou&s;ly invaded&mdash;the crime was notorious and unque&s;tionable&mdash;a regular trial mu&s;t have been the work of time&mdash;and while this would be depending, it was imagined the evil would &s;pread. Both the letter and &s;pirit of the law had been openly in&s;ulted and defied, by the people in Bo&s;ton; and, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, the <HI>forms</HI> of the law, in bringing them back to a &s;en&s;e of their duty, when it was apprehended that the delay of puni&s;hment would be dangerous to the community, were thought to be di&s;pen&s;ible. Such con&s;iderations indeed will not authori&s;e a judge, or any court of ju&s;tice, to pro|ceed in this compendious manner; but when a ca&s;e comes before the whole legi&s;lative body, they have always the power to di&s;pen&s;e with the ordinary forms, and to do what is conceived to be mo&s;t conducive to the public &s;afety. For, to u&s;e the words of the ju&s;tly celebrated Dr. BLACKSTONE,
<Q>The bare idea of a &s;tate, without a power, &s;omewhere ve&s;ted, to alter every part of its laws, is the height of poli|tical ab&s;urdity.</Q></P>
<P>It is moreover objected, that
<Q>&s;uch a mode of puni&s;hment involves the innocent in the &s;ame cala|mity
<PB N="18" REF="013224_0017_0F904510412F2960" MS="y">
with the guilty.</Q>
In an&s;wer to which, it is &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that this inconvenience mu&s;t always attend all puni&s;hments inflicted on a people, whether by God or man, and nece&s;&s;arily ari&s;es from the condition of the world. There is no body of people &s;o bad, but many innocent per|&s;ons are intermixed with them. At the very wor&s;t, there is always a number of innocent children, who are connected with, and dependent upon, the proper delinquents. The con&s;equence of which is, that no people, and commonly no individual, can po&s;&s;i|bly be puni&s;hed, without hurting &s;ome innocent per&s;ons. The objection therefore, if it has any weight, will hold good again&s;t all public, and mo&s;t private puni&s;hments, of what kind &s;oever. In the town of <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> there are many innocent, worthy and re&s;pectable per&s;ons (many more than is commonly imagined) who are as free from the public guilt, and hold it in as much abomination, as any men within his Maje&s;ty's dominions. For their &s;ake, more e&s;pe|cially, tho&s;e who have the greate&s;t regard for the ho|nour of government, wi&s;h that the puni&s;hment could have been avoided. But as this was politically im|po&s;&s;ible, they mu&s;t bear their own &s;hare, with pru|dence and patience, as well as they can,&mdash;enjoying a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of their own innocence,&mdash;maintaining their integrity,
<Q>in the mid&s;t of a crooked and per|ver&s;e generation</Q>
&mdash;and looking forward to that time, which I hope is not di&s;tant, when they may expect to be di&s;tingui&s;hed with &s;uch favours as the public can give.</P>
<P>The <HI>re&s;olves</HI> of the above-mentioned <HI>committees</HI> al&s;o expre&s;s, their brethren in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> meaning the offenders again&s;t government, are to be con&s;idered
<Q>as &s;uffering in the common cau&s;e of American
<PB N="19" REF="013224_0018_0F8FB56872319818">
liberty.</Q>
But I hope the <HI>licentiou&s;ne&s;s</HI> of their be|haviour, is not avowed to be any part of the &s;y&s;tem of <HI>American liberty</HI>; and I &s;hould be extremely &s;orry to find, that the <HI>common cau&s;e of the colonies</HI> requires &s;uch defences as theirs. If a raving enthu&s;ia&s;t, in order to promote the cau&s;e of American liberty, &s;hould take it in his head to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate his Prince, and afterwards &s;hould be puni&s;hed for his trea&s;on; he might with equal propriety, be con&s;idered as &s;uf|fering in the cau&s;e of American liberty. But, in that ca&s;e, I believe no &s;ober Americans would think them&s;elves bound to abet the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination; and for the &s;ame rea&s;ons, we are under no obligations to abet the de&s;tructive violence of the people in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> or to endeavour to &s;kreen it from public ju&s;tice. So far as they meant well, they ought to be commended; but &s;o far as they did wrong, they ought to be con|demned. And we both expo&s;e our&s;elves, and injure our cau&s;e, by appearing to countenance their lawle&s;s and unwarrantable proceedings.</P>
<P>The &s;ame <HI>re&s;olves</HI> al&s;o condemn, <HI>as oppre&s;&s;ive and dangerous,</HI> the other <HI>act</HI> for altering the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice in the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay</HI>; and it has been u&s;ed as an in&s;trument, in the hands of our popular incendiaries, for farther enflaming the minds of the Americans again&s;t the King and his Mini&s;ters. But it de&s;erves notice, that the alteration made by the act, is rather an imaginary than a real evil. For it introduces into that province a regulation, which is far from being incon&s;i&s;tent with the happine&s;s of the people; as it only reduces them to a form of pro|ceedings, under which the inhabitants of <HI>New-York</HI> and <HI>New-Jer&s;ey</HI> have been as happy as any people in <HI>America.</HI> Indeed it abridges them of &s;ome privi|leges that had been granted by charter. But no pri|vileges
<PB N="20" REF="013224_0019_0F8FB5693B1A3020">
are curtailed by the act, but &s;uch as had been abu&s;ed and forfeited over and over, and &s;uch as probably would continue to be abu&s;ed, to the great injury and di&s;turbance of that province, as well as to the di&s;honour and reproach of the nation&middot; It is the opinion of the be&s;t friends to the rights of man|kind, that charters <HI>may</HI> be forfeited; and, it is a proof of the mildne&s;s, not of the rigour, of the admini&s;tration, that the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> charter, after &s;o many abu&s;es and provocations, has not been to|tally vacated, rather than abridged.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the two la&s;t-mentioned acts, there is a third, for &s;ettling <HI>the government of Quebec,</HI> which has been as &s;ucce&s;sfully applied to the &s;ame noble purpo&s;e of enraging the Americans again&s;t the mea&s;ures of government; and more lies and mi&s;re|pre&s;entations concerning this act have been circulated, than one would think malice and fal&s;ehood could invent. It is po&s;itively a&s;&s;erted, and generally be|lieved, on the evidence of po&s;itive a&s;&s;ertions, that by this act the Popi&s;h religion is <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hed,</HI> through|out the va&s;t extent of country now &s;ubject to the government of <HI>Quebec</HI>; and that the Prote&s;tant re|ligion is there obliged to &s;kulk in corners, not daring to lift up its head. Whereas, if we have recour&s;e to the words of the act, we &s;hall &s;ee, that the Popi&s;h religion is no more than <HI>tolerated</HI> within that domi|nion; which was one of the conditions on which the country &s;urrendered it&s;elf to the crown of Great Britain; and that a proper foundation is laid for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Prote&s;tant religion, which is meant to take place. Tithes, which are the property of the tolerated Romi&s;h church in all the pari&s;hes, are indeed ordered to be paid, as formerly, to the mini&s;ter of the pari&s;h; but the very moment a man
<PB N="21" REF="013224_0020_0F8FB56A1226F900">
declares him&s;elf a Prote&s;tant, he is freed, by the act, from the obligation to pay tithes to the Popi&s;h in|cumbent. In that ca&s;e, it is provided, that
<Q>his Maje&s;ty, his heirs or &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, may make &s;uch provi&s;ion out of the&mdash;accu&s;tomed dues and rights, for the encouragement of the <HI>Prote&s;tant religion,</HI> and for the maintenance of a <HI>Prote&s;tant clergy</HI> within the &s;aid province, <HI>as he or they &s;hall, from time to time, think nece&s;&s;ary and expedient.</HI></Q>
It is true, the Papi&s;ts in <HI>Canada</HI> might have had a tole|ration le&s;s generous than is granted them, without the Parliament's allowing to the clergy their tithes, or to the pari&s;hes their churches. But &s;uch a tolera|tion, although it might have fulfilled the letter of the articles of the treaty, would not have an&s;wered their expectations, nor have left upon their minds favourable impre&s;&s;ions of the Briti&s;h ju&s;tice and honour. If we had taken from them their churches, or &s;tripped the clergy of their tithes, which might have been done with equal propriety, it would pro|bably have encrea&s;ed the number of his Maje&s;ty's di&s;affected American &s;ubjects; which appears to be too great without them. And as to <HI>trials by juries,</HI> they are affirmed to be excluded by the act; but the a&s;&s;ertion is groundle&s;s and fal&s;e. Juries are no more excluded from <HI>Canada,</HI> than they are excluded from the other American colonies. They have never been e&s;tabli&s;hed by act of Parliament in any of the colo|nies, excepting the late act for the regulation of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay.</HI> They owe their being in <HI>America</HI> to acts of our provincial A&s;&s;emblies, confirmed at home; and the provincial legi&s;lature of <HI>Canada</HI> may introduce them as &s;oon as they plea&s;e, and it is ex|pected that they will, as &s;oon as the inhabitants de|&s;ire

them, or the &s;tate of the country will admit of them.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See this point cleared up, in a candid and &s;atisfactory man|ner, in a pamphlet entitled, <HI>The Ju&s;tice and Policy of the Act of Parliament, for making more effectual Provi&s;ion for the Govern|ment of Quebec,</HI> which has been lately reprinted by Mr. GAINE. See al&s;o a defence of the general policy of this act, in <HI>A Letter (&s;aid to be wrote by Lord Lyttelton) to the Earl of Chatham,</HI> re|printed by Mr. RIVINGTON.</NOTE></P>
<P>I have taken this notice of the three la&s;t acts re|lating to the colonies, in order to &s;hew, that in them|&s;elves they are not of &s;o alarming a nature as has been repre&s;ented, and that they wear not that tre|mendous a&s;pect which our wild imaginations have given them. Two of them were meant as puni&s;h|ments for crimes again&s;t the &s;tate, and to make ex|amples of tho&s;e who were con&s;idered as the greate&s;t offenders, and from who&s;e republican &s;pirit a general mi&s;chief was apprehended. The de&s;ign of the other act was to &s;ecure to a new colony the religious tole|ration it had a <HI>right</HI> to demand, and otherwi&s;e to ea&s;e the minds of a numerous body of people, who&s;e behaviour towards government had been decent and unexceptionable &s;ince they owed it allegiance, and who were likely to prove his Maje&s;ty's <HI>mo&s;t loyal and faithful &s;ubjects</HI> in his American dominions.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all that has been &s;ugge&s;ted, and in &s;pite of all that can be &s;aid, I am aware our poli|tical incendiaries will go on in their own way, and &s;till contend, that the&s;e acts are tyrannical and arbi|trary, and threaten the de&s;truction of American liberty. But if we would recollect our&s;elves, and attend a moment to the conduct and characters of the&s;e men, we &s;hould be convinced that no repre&s;en|tations
<PB N="23" REF="013224_0022_0F8FB56B737C86D8" MS="y">
of theirs are worthy of regard. For, in all their motions, they di&s;cover them&s;elves to be under the undue influence of prejudice and pa&s;&s;ion. Thro' this dark and mi&s;ty medium every object appears to them under a violent di&s;tortion; and as thus di&s;torted, they mu&s;t a&s;cribe it to others. No wonder then, that they put the very wor&s;t con&s;tructions upon, and a&s;&s;ign the very wor&s;t motives for, all the proceed|ings of the Briti&s;h Parliament.</P>
<P>However, let us now &s;uppo&s;e the truth and reality of the facts as &s;tated by them; yet the inferences they intend, will by no means follow. Suppo&s;ing Popery were actually <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hed</HI> in <HI>Canada,</HI> on the reque&s;t of the inhabitants; would it follow, that it was de&s;igned al&s;o to e&s;tabli&s;h it in the other colonies, where the inhabitants are aver&s;e to it? Can any man, in his &s;en&s;es, believe this to be the de&s;ign of Parlia|ment? Again: &s;uppo&s;ing the puni&s;hment inflicted on the Bo&s;tonians to be arbitrary and &s;evere; yet tho&s;e who are free from their guilt, and mean not to contract it, have no rea&s;on to fear the like puni&s;h|ment.
<Q>For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? Do that which is good, and thou &s;halt have prai&s;e of the &s;ame: for he is the mini|&s;ter of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the &s;word in vain; for he is the mini&s;ter of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evil.</Q>
So far as we are innocent, we are &s;afe; but if we undertake to ju&s;tify or abet the crimes of others, we &s;hare in their guilt; and particularly, if we are fomenters of the &s;edition that rages in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> we mu&s;t take the con&s;equence.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="013224_0023_0F8FB56C2FA9C458">But the Bo&s;tonians, you &s;ay, are <HI>over-puni&s;hed.</HI> If that be the ca&s;e, they are entitled to our pity, and to our influence in obtaining a mitigation of their pu|ni&s;hment. But this can be no rea&s;on, for our put|ing our&s;elves in the &s;ame predicament with them, for making our&s;elves partners in their guilt, or for bringing upon our&s;elves a &s;imilar puni&s;hment. We mu&s;t be fools to think of doing this; and if they de&s;ire us to do it, their mode&s;ty is like that of <HI>the fox in the fable,</HI> who, becau&s;e he happened to have lo&s;t his own tail, reque&s;ted of his brother foxes, that they would all &s;uffer their tails to be cut off too.

<P>The proper di&s;pute &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between Great Bri|tain and any of her colonies, excepting that of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay,</HI> is only <HI>de Lana Caprina,</HI> about an act impo&s;ing a duty of <HI>three pence a pound</HI> upon tea.

Can &s;uch behaviour on &s;o &s;light a provocation, proceed from <HI>dutiful and loyal &s;ubjects?</HI> No; it is impo&s;&s;ible.

Ever &s;ince the reduction of <HI>Canada,</HI> we have been bloated with a vain opinion of our own power and importance. Our ca&s;e has pro|duced pride and wantonne&s;s. We have been intoxi|cated with &s;uch draughts of liberty, as our con&s;ti|tutions would not bear; and under this intoxication, we have conceited that all the privileges indulged us were the effects of fear.

<P>Yet whatever <HI>time</HI> may produce, at pre&s;ent the petty i&s;land of <HI>Britain</HI> is able to govern ten &s;uch <HI>Americas</HI> as this, if &s;he will exert her power.

We &s;hould be fully con|vinced of this, were it not for our ignorance, and want of con&s;ideration; and willing to confe&s;s it, were it not for our pride.

<Q>Notwith&s;tanding all that can be &s;aid of the naval &s;trength of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> it is a&s;&s;erted by our patriotic leaders, and we have rea&s;on to think, that the&s;e colonies, of them&s;elves, are able to with&s;tand all her force.</Q>
The judgment of Hea|ven vi&s;ibly appears in this dreadful infatuation. It was but a few years ago, that we believed, and found by experience, that the colonies were unable to with|&s;tand the militia of <HI>Canada,</HI> &s;upported by a few regiments of regular troops from <HI>France.</HI> That this was the general opinion, mo&s;t of us may remember; and it is evident from the me&s;&s;ages that pa&s;&s;ed between Governor SHIRLEY and the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;enta|tives of <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> from the addre&s;s of the a&s;&s;embly of <HI>Virginia</HI> to the King at the beginning of the late war,
<PB N="27" REF="013224_0026_0F8FB5700E7FEDE8">
and from many other authentic documents of that period. The Colonies then humbly and ardently implored that <HI>Great-Britain</HI> would &s;peedily &s;tep in to their re&s;cue, and pre&s;erve them from a de&s;truction that threatened to overwhelm them. Their prayers were &s;oon heard; and what was the con&s;equence we all know. The &s;trong bulwarks and fortre&s;&s;es of <HI>Canada</HI> were &s;tormed, and the country conquered by the di&s;cipline and invincible bravery of but a &s;mall part of the Briti&s;h troops.</P>
<P>There is no room to doubt but &s;uch an army as was employed in the reduction of <HI>Canada</HI> would be more than &s;ufficient for the conque&s;t of all the di&s;|affected American Colonies, &s;hould &s;uch a re&s;olution become nece&s;&s;ary in order to reduce them to obedience. For they are open and acce&s;&s;ible on every quarter, and have not a &s;ingle fortre&s;s to cover them, nor one regiment of regular troops to defend them; and they are without military &s;tores, without magazines, and without the &s;kill that is nece&s;&s;ary for &s;upporting an army. Under &s;uch circum&s;tances what would the boa&s;ted numbers of our inhabitants avail us again&s;t an attack from <HI>Great-Britain?</HI> If an army was &s;ent in upon us, which a body of forty thou&s;and of our militia was unable to with&s;tand (for it is impo&s;&s;ible that a greater number of undi&s;ciplined men could act to advantage) it would be able to carry de&s;olation through the whole country; and all the men in the Colonies were they firmly united, would not be able to oppo&s;e it. But yet if the army here &s;uppo&s;ed, &s;hould be found unequal to the de&s;ign of reducing the Colonies, <HI>Great-Britain</HI> could &s;end of her own troops a &s;econd, of equal &s;trength to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the fir&s;t; to the&s;e &s;he could add a third of <HI>He&s;&s;ians,</HI> a fourth of <HI>Hanoverians,</HI> and &s;o on till the work were

compleated. She could ea&s;ily take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all our &s;ea-coa&s;ts where our wealth is principally &s;eated, and force us to fly into the back parts of the country for immediate &s;afety. There an army of <HI>Canadians</HI> might be ordered to meet us, and unnumbered tribes of <HI>&s;avages</HI> might be let loo&s;e upon us at the &s;ame time, while our lands would he uncultivated, our &s;tores exhau&s;ted, our families un&s;heltered, and tho&s;e that happened to e&s;cape the &s;word, glittering and flaming both in the front and rear of our &s;ettlements, would &s;oon peri&s;h by &s;ickne&s;s or famine.</P>
<P>All that is here mentioned <HI>Great-Britain</HI> is able to do; and all this I believe &s;he <HI>would</HI> do, &s;hould &s;he be obliged to enter into a war with the Colonies&mdash; provided the Americans had re&s;olution and <HI>firmne&s;s</HI> enough (for &s;o &s;ome would call it) to hold out to &s;uch extremity. But I am too well acquainted with their character to expect that they would prove thus <HI>ob&s;tinate</HI> in the day of trial. When they come to find that on their &s;ide there can be no pro&s;pect of victory, but that every day mu&s;t deepen their di&s;tre&s;s and render their condition wor&s;e and wor&s;e; their natural under&s;tandings will return to them, and ir|re&s;i&s;tibly plead the nece&s;&s;ity of a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. In that ca&s;e happy would it be for them, if they could be con&s;idered only as conquered enemies; but alas! they mu&s;t be viewed in the light of <HI>van|qui&s;hed rebels,</HI> and treated accordingly. Their leaders mu&s;t be given up into the executioner's hands, con|fi&s;cations of their e&s;tates forfeited by rebellion, mu&s;t follow, and all mu&s;t be left at the mercy of their vanqui&s;hers. When one people is conquered by another in war, private property is re&s;tored to its former po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors; but when rebellions are cru&s;hed, the mo&s;t to be expected is, that the lives of tho&s;e that belong to the lower cla&s;&s;es will be &s;pared.</P>

But in <HI>New-England</HI> I conceive, the real &s;entiments of the people are of a <HI>peculiar</HI> complexion. Many of the fir&s;t &s;ettlers imported with them an aver&s;ion to the <HI>regal</HI> part of our Con&s;titution, and were thorough-paced <HI>Republicans.</HI> To every &s;pecies of monarchy they were as inveterate enemies as any of their brethren, whom they left behind them in <HI>England</HI>; &s;ome of whom could not bear to read the word <HI>King</HI> in their <HI>Bibles,</HI> but wherever it occurred they &s;ub&s;tituted <HI>Civil Magi&s;trate</HI> in its place. It is well known that even good old father BAXTER was a remarkable in&s;tance of this nature.

<P>Although many of their de&s;cendants have acquired liberal &s;entiments, and have renounced the bigotry and prejudices of their well-meaning fore-fathers, whether relating to matters of religion or government; yet this is by no means the ca&s;e with regard to the body of the people. They &s;till retain an hereditary aver&s;ion to the frame of the Engli&s;h Con&s;titution, and to the controll of monarchy; and this aver&s;ion has been from time to time, occa&s;ionally animated and inflamed by a &s;et of <HI>Pulpit-Incendiaries,</HI> for which that part of the country has been ever famous.

<P>The confu&s;ions of the pre&s;ent time have been thought to afford a favorable opportunity, for putting their de&s;ign in exe|cution.

<P>But another &s;cheme is propo&s;ed, at fir&s;t view le&s;s &s;hocking, which al&s;o appears to be recommended by the <HI>Congre&s;s,</HI> and which many at pre&s;ent are inclined to adopt; I mean, <HI>a general non-importation agreement</HI> throughout the Colonies. Again&s;t a propo&s;al of this nature I have two objections to offer: Namely, that it will greatly di&s;tre&s;s a country which I love; and that it will not an&s;wer the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>In order (N. B.) to get rid of a duty of <HI>three pence a pound on tea,</HI> it is propo&s;ed to &s;top all importation from <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and even from the <HI>We&s;t-India I&s;lands,</HI> till the act impo&s;ing it &s;hall be repealed. But a remedy of this kind is ten thou&s;and times wor&s;e than the di&s;ea&s;e. It is, for the wi&s;dom of it, like cutting off an arm, in order to get rid of a &s;mall &s;ore in one of the fingers.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="013224_0037_0F8FB57B2C78A4C0">On a late trial of non-importation from <HI>Great-Britain</HI> only, as &s;oon as the &s;tores of Engli&s;h goods began to be exhau&s;ted, every family among us ex|perienced &s;uch inconveniences and difficulties, as produced a general murmur and complaint. For although the articles imported from <HI>England</HI> are not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport <HI>animal</HI> life; yet it was found that the <HI>civilized</HI> life we had been u&s;ed to, and which is nece&s;&s;ary to the happine&s;s of all but &s;avages, depended, in no &s;mall degree, upon our importations from <HI>Great-Britain.</HI> And had the non-importation continued much longer, it would have excited in&s;ur|rections in mo&s;t parts of the country.</P>
<P>But a non-importation from the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> would &s;till more tenderly affect us. For to &s;ay nothing of <HI>Rum,</HI> or of <HI>Mola&s;&s;es</HI> for the u&s;e of our di&s;tilleries, without which more than a hundred thou&s;and Ame|rican dram-drinkers would &s;oon be clamorous; the want of the &s;ingle article <HI>Sugar</HI> would di&s;tre&s;s every family upon this Continent. For this, in the quantity that is nece&s;&s;ary, we could find no &s;ufficient &s;ub&s;titute: the hardened juice of our <HI>Maple,</HI> where it could be had, would be but a forty one; and as to <HI>Honey,</HI> we all know its u&s;e; and were our &s;tock of it ever &s;o large, it would prove but a bad &s;weetner of the bitter draught of a non-importation.</P>
<P>Here then it is propo&s;ed, that, to the non-importa|tion which we have experienced and could hardly bear, another &s;hould be added, that would affect us &s;till wor&s;e; and that a double weight &s;hould be fa&s;tened upon tho&s;e &s;houlders, which were ready to give way under a &s;ingle one. But this is not the wor&s;t of the ca&s;e. It is generally believed, and inti|mations from <HI>England</HI> have confirmed the opinion, that if the Colonies &s;hould re&s;olve to import nothing
<PB N="39" REF="013224_0038_0F8FB57BFAFD2688">
from <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> they will not be &s;uffered to import from any other quarter&mdash;not, even the &s;alt that is nece&s;&s;ary to cure their winter's provi&s;ions, or to &s;ea&s;on their porridge: And be&s;ides this, that an ab&s;olute <HI>non-exportation</HI> will be ordered, and not a &s;ingle ve&s;&s;el &s;uffered to go out of our harb|ours. Such an order, we know, can effectually be executed, with the greate&s;t ea&s;e. It is but command|ing the &s;everal Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;es to grant no clear|ances; and then every ve&s;&s;el that offered to &s;ail, would be a lawful &s;eizure. A few of the King's frigates would be &s;ufficient to do the bu&s;ine&s;s, for all the Co|lonies on the Continent. Two or three of them &s;ta|tioned at the <HI>Capes of Virginia,</HI> would command every ve&s;&s;el belonging to the Ports, and to the fine navig|able rivers, of <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Maryland.</HI> As many &s;ta|tioned at the <HI>Capes of Delaware,</HI> would &s;ecure <HI>Penn|&s;ylvania</HI> and <HI>We&s;t-Jer&s;ey</HI>&mdash;and &s;o of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Now a total &s;tagnation of all foreign commerce, would at once place us in a glorious and ble&s;&s;ed &s;tate. In the fir&s;t place, all that live by this commerce would be thrown out of employ. Our <HI>&s;ailors</HI> would be turned a&s;hore; our &s;hips would rot in our harbours; and our e&s;tates, which con&s;i&s;t of wharfs or ware|hou&s;es, would become as worthle&s;s, as tho&s;e of the &s;ame nature are at pre&s;ent in the town of <HI>Bo&s;ton.</HI> Our <HI>&s;hip-builders,</HI> and their attendants, their <HI>&s;miths, car men &amp;c.</HI> with all that are employed in the bu&s;ine&s;s of cordage and rigging, mu&s;t be immediately di&s;charged. The numerous body of <HI>pilots</HI> and <HI>boatmen</HI> mu&s;t be turned adrift. Nor would it fare much better with our <HI>&s;hop-keepers</HI> and <HI>merchants,</HI> who&s;e families are &s;upported by the profits ari&s;ing from their re&s;pective occupations. The expen&s;ive bu&s;ine&s;s of all our <HI>iron|works</HI> mu&s;t &s;top; and the many thou&s;ands which they
<PB N="40" REF="013224_0039_0F904510BAE76C08" MS="y">
provide for, mu&s;t, unprincipled as tho&s;e wretches commonly are, be let loo&s;e upon the country, to get their living as they can.</P>
<P>Now all the&s;e cla&s;&s;es of people, and many others which I have not enumerated, mu&s;t have a &s;upport, and but few of them will be able to &s;upport them|&s;elves; and if their poverty is not relieved to their &s;atisfaction, they will &s;oon learn to carve for them|&s;elves. There are but few pari&s;hes and counties among us, which have not complained of the burthen of their own poor. But what will they &s;ay, when the burthen comes to be encrea&s;ed an hundred-fold, as it nece&s;&s;arily mu&s;t, when a general non-importation and non-exportation take place; and all their wanted re&s;ources fail them at the &s;ame time. The want of the money, of which we have been lately drained, in order to pamper the Bo&s;ton fanaticks, will then be &s;everely felt: Nor can we expect any return of a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance in our di&s;tre&s;s from that Province, as their &s;ufferings will be much greater than ours.</P>
<P>In the Province of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay,</HI> there is a large number of populous &s;ea-port towns, which have no other &s;upport than their fi&s;hery. The town of <HI>Glouce&s;ter</HI> has three hundred &s;chooners employed in that &s;ervice, with a proportionable number of hands. In the town of <HI>Marblehead</HI> there are &s;uppo&s;ed to be near four thou&s;and men, and many of them with families, that know of no other means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence than the cod-fi&s;hery. I might mention <HI>Plymouth, Salem, Beverly</HI> and a number of other towns, that are nearly in the &s;ame &s;ituation. Now, when all the&s;e fi&s;hermen are turned a&s;hore, and their ve&s;&s;els become u&s;ele&s;s; they mu&s;t, with their unprovided families, di&s;per&s;e them&s;elves among&s;t the inhabitants, and while the country affords any thing to eat, they will not &s;tarve.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="013224_0040_0F904511792015A0">But to return to the&s;e Colonies. I have mentioned the di&s;tre&s;s that mu&s;t immediately overwhelm many orders of people, on a general &s;tagnation of com|merce; but have &s;aid nothing of our Farmers, or tho&s;e that live by the cultivation of their lands.&mdash; The&s;e may think them&s;elves a kind of <HI>privileged</HI> per|&s;ons, and imagine that &s;uch a revolution of affairs will affect them but little; yet a very &s;hort experience will open their eyes, and convince them of the con|trary. It is their farms, as all other re&s;ources will fail, that mu&s;t &s;upport all the abovementioned thou|&s;ands of di&s;tre&s;&s;ed people. Who mu&s;t furni&s;h them with food? None can do it, but, THE FARMERS. Who mu&s;t &s;upply them with cloathing? THE FAR|MERS. Who mu&s;t &s;helter many of them in their hou&s;es? THE FARMERS. And can they expect pay for all this? Alas! tho&s;e poor creatures will have nothing to make payment with. And if they are employed as labourers, they are all unacquainted with the bu&s;ine&s;s; and their labour will turn to but little account. Indeed, were the markets abroad open, the farmer might &s;omewhat increa&s;e the quan|tity of his beef, his wheat and other produce, by their means, &s;o that his bargain would be le&s;s into|lerable. But the foreign con&s;umption, on which he is now growing rich, will entirely cea&s;e; and there will be no demand for his beef, and his wheat and other produce. All that he rai&s;es mu&s;t peri&s;h on his hands, except what he expends in his own family, and on the poor that will be pre&s;&s;ing upon him.</P>
<P>When all people are thus di&s;tre&s;&s;ed; when every mind is unea&s;y and di&s;contented; it will be natural for them to fall to reproaching one another, with be|ing the authors of this general calamity. This will be productive of eternal quarrels, and riots, and di&s;|turbances,
<PB N="42" REF="013224_0041_0F90451254E240A0">
and acts of violence, among&s;t our&s;elves; and then our mi&s;ery will be compleat.</P>
<P>Yet after all, were it likely that the&s;e political ago|nies and convul&s;ions would produce a repeal of the act in di&s;pute, it would be <HI>&s;ome</HI> alleviation of our misfortunes to con&s;ider, that we &s;hould gain by them <HI>Three pence a pound,</HI> on all the tea we &s;hould have occa&s;ion to purcha&s;e. But my <HI>&s;econd</HI> objection again&s;t a general non-importation agreement is, that it will not an&s;wer the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>After what has been &s;aid and done by the Colonies, a general non-importation agreement will be con&s;idered by <HI>Great Britain</HI> as an act of ho&s;tility, intended to <HI>compel</HI> her to relinqui&s;h her claim; and &s;he will not &s;ubmit to be conquered by <HI>&s;uch</HI> weapons, any more than by force of arms. It is not pretended that &s;he is altogether invulnerable in this part. The blow would reach her, and be felt by her; but the wound would not be mortal. The &s;trength and vigour of her con&s;titution would bear much more, than we are able to inflict. But&mdash;the &s;haft, ungraciou&s;ly aimed at the vitals of our Mother, on the rebound may prove fatal to our&s;elves.</P>
<P>A total &s;tagnation of commerce would affect <HI>Great Britain,</HI> in much the &s;ame manner, that it would affect her colonies, or any other commercial people; that is, it would rob her of her &s;ub&s;i&s;tance. But a partial &s;tagnation could not affect her in the &s;ame manner that we &s;hould be affected by a total &s;tag|nation. Now, the non-importation in que&s;tion, while it would cau&s;e a total &s;tagnation of our com|merce, would produce no more than a partial &s;tag|nation of hers; and con&s;equently would not place her in a &s;ituation &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, as it would place us. Her trade is not confined to her American Colonies.
<PB N="43" REF="013224_0042_0F904513017B45C0">
She has &s;hips and factories in every quarter of the globe; and the trea&s;ures of the Ea&s;t and We&s;t are perpetually flowing in upon her. She receives no nece&s;&s;ary or u&s;eful articles from the&s;e Colonies, but what &s;he formerly received, and may at any time be &s;upplied with, from foreign nations. Her manufac|tures that are con&s;umed in the Colonies, &s;he can &s;hortly find ways to di&s;po&s;e of at other markets.</P>
<P>There is one branch of this hopeful project, that will contribute immediately and directly to the ad|vantage of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> almo&s;t in the &s;ame propor|tion that it will di&s;tre&s;s our&s;elves. The Reader &s;carcely needs to be told, that what is here meant, is the &s;topping all intercour&s;e and communication be|tween the Colonies and the <HI>We&s;t-Indies.</HI> As &s;oon as this takes place, the markets of Great Britain will be &s;upplied, not only with the quantity of goods from the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> which they have formerly received, but with the addition of all that is now con&s;umed in the American Colonies. The Briti&s;h merchants will likewi&s;e have the advantage of &s;upplying the I&s;lands with many articles, which at pre&s;ent are not &s;cored in any of their invoices.</P>
<P>The We&s;t-Indians them&s;elves indeed may be &s;ome|what injured and di&s;concerted at fir&s;t, by the execu|tion of this part of the plan; but far le&s;s, than &s;eems to be generally expected and intended by us. The I&s;land of <HI>Jamaica</HI> can &s;upply her Planters with all kinds of provi&s;ions, but butter and flour; and with all the lumber that may be required, for a hundred years to come, excepting &s;taves and heading for their <HI>Rum Puncheons.</HI> The&s;e &s;he has often received from <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> from whence &s;he might receive them again. But there will be no occa&s;ion for &s;ending &s;o far. <HI>Ca|nada</HI> can &s;upply her, and all the other i&s;lands, with
<PB N="44" REF="013224_0043_0F904515A2630638">
the&s;e articles, as well as with flour, in any quantity that may be ordered; to &s;ay nothing of Georgia and the two Floridas, which abound in common lumber, at the &s;ervice of the <HI>Windward, Leeward,</HI> and <HI>Caribbee</HI> I&s;lands. So that after the fir&s;t year, new channels may be opened, plans formed, and corre&s;pondences &s;ettled, in &s;uch a manner, that the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> may be nearly as well &s;upplied without our a&s;&s;i&s;tance, as they now are with it; and with &s;ome articles, perhaps better.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;ing the contrary; yet what &s;hould we gain by this curious bargain? Why, the ill-will and re&s;entment of all the We&s;t-Indians. For &s;ome years pa&s;t, they have cultivated a peculiar friend&s;hip with the North-American Colonies, and propo&s;ed to them|&s;elves much happine&s;s from a clo&s;er alliance.</P>
<P>They have &s;ent hither their children, in large numbers, for their education: and many of them have brought over their families, and liberally &s;pent the incomes of their e&s;tates among us. But when they find that, we can &s;o ingeniou&s;ly contrive &s;chemes to di&s;tre&s;s them without benefiting our&s;elves; as they are generally not wanting in &s;pirit, they will be apt to re&s;ent &s;uch ill u&s;age, by withdrawing their &s;ons and their families from among us, and perhaps by breaking off all further connexion with us in the way of commerce.</P>
<P>From what has been &s;aid, it will naturally be con|cluded, that by a general non-importation agreement we &s;hall carry on a very unequal warfare with Great Britain; which will much &s;ooner compel us to yield, than her to comply. The want of her North-Ame|rican trade may hurt her, but it will not reduce her to extremity; and, if I may judge from my own feel|ings, nothing but the utmo&s;t extremity will induce
<PB N="45" REF="013224_0044_0F904516FAE85E38">
her, where &s;he believes &s;he has right of her &s;ide, and where her honour is deeply at &s;take, to give up the point in di&s;pute.</P>
<P>At the time of our former non-importation, the ca&s;e was materially different. The <HI>Stamp-act</HI> was &s;o contrary to all our ideas of American rights, and &s;o much was offered again&s;t the policy of the act, both here and at home, that there was no difficulty in re|pealing it. Afterwards when we exclaimed again&s;t the duties impo&s;ed upon paper, gla&s;s, &amp;c. and agreed not to import the &s;everal articles loaded with duties; our views were comparatively moderate, and we had a large body of friends in England to &s;upport us. And were the propo&s;ition now only not to import, or to con&s;ume, the tea that is charged with the duty; the ca&s;e would be the &s;ame that it was then&mdash;we &s;hould have the &s;ame friends that we then had&mdash;and the duty would probably be removed, on the &s;ame principle that tho&s;e duties then were. But our con|duct now is &s;o wild and di&s;tracted&mdash;our tumults and di&s;orders are carried to &s;o unrea&s;onable and unwar|rantable a length&mdash;nay, &s;uch a &s;pirit of rebellion has broke forth among us, and &s;uch a determined enmity again&s;t the <HI>&s;upremacy</HI> of <HI>Great Britain</HI> now predomi|nates in the Colonies, that we have hardly a &s;ingle friend remaining in <HI>England.</HI> Even the Manufactu|rers join with all other orders of people, in condem|ning our extravagance; and, which is &s;till more, the Writers and Speakers again&s;t the King's mini&s;try allow that it is inexcu&s;able.</P>
<P>It appears, therefore, that nothing will be likely to procure a repeal of the <HI>Tea-act,</HI> or the removal of any other grievance of the like kind, but, the re&s;to|ration of peace and order among&s;t our&s;elves&mdash; a can|did acknowledgment of our political errors and of|fences
<PB N="46" REF="013224_0045_0F9045181AD191F0">
&mdash;a formal allowance of the rightful &s;upremacy in general, of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> over the American Co|lonies&mdash;a declaration of our aver&s;ion to a &s;tate of in|dependency, with a <HI>corre&s;ponding behaviour</HI>&mdash;a re&s;pect|ful remon&s;trance on the &s;ubject of taxation&mdash;an a&s;|&s;urance of our willingne&s;s to contribute, in &s;ome equitable proportion, towards defraying the public expences&mdash;and the propo&s;al of a rea&s;onable plan for a general American con&s;titution. This, it is hum|bly conceived, was to have been the bu&s;ine&s;s of the <HI>Congre&s;s</HI>; and if they had acted upon the&s;e principles, and with &s;uch views, not only the pre&s;ent, but all future generations, would <HI>call them ble&s;&s;ed.</HI></P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all unfavorable &s;ymptoms and appearances, I would not pre&s;ume to form a final judgment of the <HI>Congre&s;s,</HI> till their whole plan of proceedings &s;hall be known. It is po&s;&s;ible, that all that has been wrong may be rectified in the end; and that moderate and wi&s;e mea&s;ures, tending to re&s;tore the tranquility, the happine&s;s, the honour and &s;afety of the Colonies, may at la&s;t be concerted. Should this appear, in the general re&s;ult of their councils, the members will be entitled to the grateful re&s;pect of every American, and the mi&s;takes made in the former part of their proceedings ought never to be mentioned to their di&s;advantage. But, on the other hand, &s;hould it appear, that they mean to encourage acts of ho&s;tility again&s;t Great Britain, or to &s;upport the madmen of <HI>New-England</HI> in their &s;cheme of an <HI>Independent Republic:</HI> in that ca&s;e, I affirm, that the <HI>Original Contract</HI> between them and the <HI>mo&s;t re&s;pectable</HI> part of their con&s;tituents will be <HI>di&s;&s;olved</HI>&mdash;that we &s;hall be at full liberty to con&s;ult our own &s;afety, in the manner we &s;hall think mo&s;t conducive to that end&mdash; and that we &s;hall owe them no greater re&s;pect and
<PB N="47" REF="013224_0046_0F9045183B4D4A28">
obedience, than they them&s;elves pay to the Briti&s;h Parliament.</P>
<P>The foregoing con&s;iderations are addre&s;&s;ed&mdash;not to tho&s;e ob&s;tinate, hot-headed Zealots, who are at the bottom of all our confu&s;ions; for arguments would be as much wa&s;ted upon them, as upon men that are intoxicated with liquor&mdash;but to <HI>all rea&s;onable Americans,</HI> to tho&s;e who are &s;till in the exerci&s;e of their under&s;tandings, and who&s;e minds are open to convic|tion. People of this character, it is pre&s;umed, will &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of giving up the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem of American politics, as e&s;&s;entially wrong and de&s;truc|tive; and of entering unanimou&s;ly upon moderate and conciliating mea&s;ures, as they regard the re&s;tora|tion of peace and tranquility in this, heretofore, hap|py country.</P>
<P>The great object in view, &s;hould be a general <HI>American Con&s;titution,</HI> on a free and generous Plan, worthy of <HI>Great Britain</HI> to give, and of the colonies to receive. This is now become nece&s;&s;ary to the mutual intere&s;t and honour, both of the Parent Kingdom and its American offspring. Such an e&s;tabli&s;hment is only to be obtained by decent, can|did and re&s;pectful application; and not by compul|&s;ion or threatening. To think of &s;ucceeding by force of arms, or by &s;tarving the nation into compliance, is a proof of &s;hameful ignorance, pride and &s;tupidi|ty. All &s;uch projects mu&s;t operate ten times more forceably again&s;t our&s;elves, than again&s;t <HI>Great Britain.</HI> They are, at be&s;t, but <HI>Penny wi&s;e,</HI> and <HI>Pound fooli&s;h</HI>; and therefore incon&s;i&s;tent with every maxim of &s;ound wi&s;dom and genuine Patrioti&s;m.</P>
<P>All violent oppo&s;ition to lawful authority partakes of the nature of rebellion; and a rebellion of the Co|lonies, whether it &s;hould prove &s;ucce&s;sful or un&s;uc|ce&s;sful,

would nece&s;&s;arily terminate in ruin and de|&s;truction.

things are widely and e&s;&s;entially different; and if we mi&s;take one for the other, the con&s;equence may be fatal.</P>
<P>It has been fully &s;hewn, that a rebellion of the colonies can have no rea&s;onable pro&s;pect of &s;ucceeding; and that it mu&s;t prove the de&s;truction of all that are concerned in it. But &s;up|po&s;ing that it were likely to &s;ucceed, it is of the utmo&s;t impor|tance to con&s;ider, what we &s;hould gain by it; which would be, after the de&s;olation of our country, and the &s;acrifice of thou|&s;ands of lives, an exemption from the authority of the Briti&s;h Parliament, and &s;ubjection to the authority of an American re|public. A ble&s;&s;ed exchange this! e&s;pecially if we take into the account the character of our future ma&s;ters. The principal conductors of the rebellion, would naturally have the principal authority in the republic; and the&s;e are men, who&s;e tyrannical u&s;urpation would be more oppre&s;&s;ive, than the &s;corpion power of the mo&s;t de&s;potic Prince in Europe. There would be no peace in the colonies, till we all &s;ubmitted to the republican zealots and bigots of New-England; who&s;e tender mercies, when they had power in their hands, have been ever cruel, towards all that pre&s;umed to differ from them in matters either of religion or government.</P>
<P>As &s;oon therefore, as people of this &s;tamp come to be in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of an e&s;tabli&s;hed authority, which would be the ca&s;e &s;hould the rebellion &s;ucceed, the dire effects of their per&s;ecuting, and intolerant &s;pirit will be di&s;mally felt by all that &s;hall have cou|rage to <HI>di&s;&s;ent</HI>; particularly, the members of the Church of England, the Friends or people called Quakers, the Bapti&s;ts, tho&s;e that belong to the German and Dutch Churches, and the moderate and candid part of the Pre&s;byterians them&s;elves. All the&s;e cla&s;&s;es of people then, by promoting the pre&s;ent &s;cheme for an independent government, are ab&s;urdly acting again&s;t their own intere&s;t and honour, and contributing to prepare yokes for their own necks.</P>
<P>O my infatuated Countrymen! My deluded Fellow-Subjects, and Fellow-Chri&s;tians! Open your eyes, I entreat you; awake from your dreams, and regard your own &s;afety!</P>
<P>As to you, who are members of the <HI>Church of England</HI>; it is amazing, that any of you &s;hould be &s;o blind to your own in|tere&s;ts, and &s;uch apo&s;tates from common &s;en&s;e, as to counte|nance and co-operate with a plan of procceedings, which, if it &s;ucceeds, will at once di&s;tre&s;s and di&s;grace you. You are en|deavouring to provide arms for your enemies, and to put power into the hands of tho&s;e who will u&s;e it again&s;t you. You are &s;etting up a &s;ort of people for your ma&s;ters, who&s;e principles you de&s;pi&s;e, and who were always fond of &s;ubduing by the iron

or become victims of their intolerance. Indeed it mu&s;t be con|fe&s;&s;ed, and I am &s;orry to &s;ay, that many of you appear already to have renounced one half of your principles; or you could not proceed, as you do, in direct oppo&s;ition to the e&s;tabli&s;hed rules and doctrines of the Church. The principles of &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion and obedience to lawful authority, are as in&s;eparable from <HI>a &s;ound, genuine member</HI> of the Church of England, as any reli|gious principles whatever. This Church has always been famed and re&s;pected for its <HI>loyalty,</HI> and its regard to order and government. Its annals have been never &s;tained with the hi&s;tory of plots and con&s;piracies, trea&s;ons and rebellions. Its members are in&s;tructed in their duty to government, by Three <HI>Homilies</HI> on <HI>Obedience,</HI> and &s;ix again&s;t <HI>Rebellion,</HI> which are &s;o many &s;tanding le&s;&s;ons to &s;ecure their fidelity. They are al&s;o taught to pray in the Litany, that the Almighty would pre&s;erve them, "from all &s;edition, privy con&s;piracy and rebellion." And more than one &s;olemn office is provided, for the annual commemoration of former deliverances from the power of tho&s;e, whether Papi&s;ts or Prote&s;tants,
<Q>who turn religion into rebel|lion, and faith into faction.</Q>
But if you regard none of the&s;e things, you are untoward, undutiful, and degenerate &s;ons of the Church; and &s;he will be a&s;hamed to own you for her children.</P>
<P>However, even tho&s;e of you who are but half-principled in the doctrines of the Church, will be looked upon with an evil eye, under the intended republic; and they mu&s;t give up the other moiety of their principles, before they can be &s;ecure again&s;t harm or mole&s;tation. The Church of England has always been the great ob&s;tacle in the way of tho&s;e republican fanaticks; and when once they are e&s;tabli&s;hed, no appearance of a Church|man will e&s;cape their re&s;entment, or be tolerated among them.</P>
<P>Nor will it fare better with the <HI>Friends,</HI> or people called <HI>Quakers</HI>; however peaceable in their di&s;po&s;ition, or however u&s;e|ful members of &s;ociety. What they formerly &s;uffered in <HI>New-England</HI> under the &s;ame &s;ort of men that mu&s;t and will govern this country, if it &s;hould be withdrawn from the juri&s;diction of the Briti&s;h parliament, is too well known, and can never be forgotten. You, my re&s;pected friends, have experienced the genuine &s;pirit and temper of their authority; and you can never wi&s;h to have your necks again encumbered with that <HI>Pre&s;byte|rian</HI> yoke of bondage, which neither you nor your fathers were able to bear. On the other hand, you have the &s;en&s;e to &s;ee, and the gratitude to confe&s;s, that you have been happy un|der the relief and protection afforded you by the King and Par|liament, in common with other good &s;ubjects. You will there|fore

<HI>remember</HI> (to u&s;e your own expre&s;&s;ive language) "that, as under divine Providence, you are indebted to the King and his royal ance&s;tors, for the continued favour of enjoying your religious liberties, you are under deep obligations (on <HI>this</HI> oc|ca&s;ion) to manife&s;t your loyalty and fidelity; and to di&s;cou|rage every attempt which may be made by any, to excite di&s;|affection, or di&s;re&s;pect to him."</P>
<P>The <HI>Bapti&s;ts</HI> have never had fair quarter allowed them by the demagogues of <HI>New-England</HI>; and they are perpetually complaining, from year to year, of the acts of oppre&s;&s;ion and violence with which they are hara&s;&s;ed by them. Now if the people of <HI>New-England</HI> have been thus intolerant, towards tho&s;e that differed from them only with regard to the ca&s;e of bapti&s;m, while they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an authority that was &s;ubordi|nate to the Briti&s;h Parliament; what cruelty, towards all that di&s;&s;ent from them, may be expected, &s;hould they be armed with ab&s;olute and incontrolable power?</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Germans</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> to who&s;e indu&s;try and good behaviour the Colonies are greatly indebted; if they &s;hould be|come &s;ubject to the juri&s;diction abovementioned, they will be con&s;idered as per&s;ons, not only of a different religion, but of different nations and languages, from whom they have &s;uch an aver&s;ion, that they have never admitted them to &s;ettle in <HI>New-England</HI>; and con&s;equently all the Coloni&s;ts who are of a <HI>foreign</HI> growth or extraction, mu&s;t expect to meet with a double portion of rancour and &s;everity from their new ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>Nor can the moderate part of the <HI>Pre&s;byterians,</HI> and <HI>Congrega|tionali&s;ts</HI> them&s;elves, have any pro&s;pect of continuing free from mole&s;tation under their government. Nothing can be more odious to bigots, than genero&s;ity and candour; or more intole|rable in the opinion of the furious, than moderation and meek|ne&s;s. This a&s;&s;ertion might be &s;upported by the hi&s;tory of all ages and nations; but we need not go far for a confirmation of it. For among the Pre&s;byterians and Independents in the Co|lonies, when the meek and the moderate, the candid and gene|rous have been brought before the tribunals of the bigotted and furious, as has frequently happened; they have been treated with as much unrelenting rancour and roughne&s;s, as if they had been Mahometans and Heathens. So that there is no chance or pro|bability, if the latter &s;hould come to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of de&s;potic power, which is the aim of the revolution they propo&s;e; that their di&s;pen&s;ations towards the former, would be le&s;s cruel than they commonly have been.</P>

<P>I Have &s;aid [&s;ee page 20.] that the Popi&s;h religion is not e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in <HI>Canada</HI> by the late act, but <HI>only tolerated</HI>; and that this was one of the <HI>conditions</HI> on which the country &s;urrender|ed to the crown of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> Since the greate&s;t part of this <HI>Addre&s;s</HI> was printed off, the papers publi&s;hed by the <HI>Con|gre&s;s</HI> have come to hand; in which they &s;ay, that

<Q>His Britannic Maje&s;ty on his &s;ide, agrees to grant the liberty of the catholic religion to the inhabitants of <HI>Canada.</HI> He will con|&s;equently give the mo&s;t effectual orders, that his new Roman catholic &s;ubjects may profe&s;s the wor&s;hip of their religion, ac|cording to the rites of the Romi&s;h church, as far as the laws of <HI>Great Britain</HI> permit.</Q></P>

<P><Q>And for the more perfect &s;ecurity and ea&s;e of the minds of the inhabitants of the &s;aid province, it is hereby declared, that his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects profe&s;&s;ing the religion of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> of and in the province of <HI>Quebec, may</HI> have, hold and enjoy the free exerci&s;e of the religion of the Church of <HI>Rome, &s;ubject to the King's &s;upremacy,</HI> declared and e&s;tabli&s;hed by an act made in the fir&s;t year of the reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> over all the dominions and countries which then did, or thereafter &s;hould belong, to the Imperial Crown of this realm; and that the clergy of the &s;aid Church <HI>may</HI> hold, receive and enjoy, their accu&s;tomed dues and rights, <HI>with re&s;pect to &s;uch per&s;ons only,</HI> as &s;hall profe&s;s the &s;aid religion.</Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>Provided neverthele&s;s,</HI> that it &s;hall be lawful for his Maje&s;ty, his heirs and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, to make &s;uch provi&s;ion out of the re&s;t of the &s;aid accu&s;tomed dues and rights, for the <HI>encouragement</HI> of the <HI>Prote&s;tant Religion,</HI> and for the <HI>maintenance</HI> and <HI>&s;upport</HI> of a <HI>Prote&s;tant Clergy</HI> within the &s;aid province, as he or they &s;hall, from time to time, think nece&s;&s;ary and expedient.</Q></P>
<P>The next clau&s;e of the act provides an oath of allegiance, to be taken by the Canadian Papi&s;ts, in&s;tead of the oath required by the 1&s;t <HI>Elizabeth.</HI> The &s;ucceeding clau&s;e enacts,
<Q>that all his Maje&s;ty's Canadian &s;ubjects, within the province of <HI>Quebec, the religious orders and communities only excepted,</HI> may al&s;o hold and enjoy their property and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions,</Q>
&amp;c. The la&s;t clau&s;e provides, that the King &s;hall have the power of

<P>Thus we &s;ee in what manner the toleration of the Popi&s;h re|ligion was &s;ecured to the Canadians by treaty; and the act of Parliament allows them no more than, <HI>the free exerci&s;e of their religion, without being mole&s;ted,</HI> in the public u&s;e of it, and that <HI>entire liberty</HI> in religious matters, for which they had &s;tipulated.</P>
<P>Indeed the parochial Clergy, are permitted to enjoy tho&s;e <HI>tithes,</HI> by which they had been always &s;upported. This was propo&s;ed in the treaty; but in was neither granted, nor rejected,

by the Briti&s;h General, who left it to depend upon the King's plea&s;ure. After thirteen years experience of the dutiful, peace|able and good behaviour of his Canadian &s;ubjects, and at a time when his other American &s;ubjects were become turbulent, licen|tious, and refractory, the King, to who&s;e goodne&s;s the matter had been referred, thought proper, with the approbation and con&s;ent of Parliament, to comply with the rea&s;onable expecta|tions and reque&s;ts of the Canadians, in allowing the clergy to enjoy their wonted &s;upport, under certain re&s;trictions and limita|tions. But this indulgence by no means converts the &s;tipulated toleration into an e&s;tabli&s;hment, as the Gentlemen of the Con|gre&s;s are plea&s;ed to a&s;&s;ert.</P>
<P><HI>Tithes</HI> in <HI>Canada</HI> are the <HI>property</HI> of the Remi&s;h church; and permitting a tolerated church to enjoy its own property, is far &s;hort of the idea of an e&s;tabli&s;hment. If the city of New-York &s;hould be conquered by the Papi&s;ts from <HI>France,</HI> or the Independ|ents from <HI>New-England,</HI> (which I believe in my con&s;cience would be much the wor&s;t event of the two) and at the time of its &s;urrender, the corporation of <HI>Trinity-Church</HI> &s;hould contract for the <HI>free exerci&s;e of their religion,</HI> &amp;c. the confirmation of this liberty, with a permi&s;&s;ion &s;till to enjoy the e&s;tate that belongs to them, (upon which &s;ome people have long ca&s;t an envious and wi&s;hful eye) would not amount to what is commonly under&s;tood by a religious e&s;tabli&s;hment. An e&s;tabli&s;hed religion, is a reli|gion which the civil authority engages, not only to protect, but to &s;upport; and a religion that is not provided for by the civil authority, but which is left to provide for it&s;elf, or to &s;ub&s;i&s;t on the provi&s;ion it has already made, can be no more than a tole|rated religion.</P>
<P>Now the Popi&s;h religion in <HI>Canada</HI> the Government is un|der no engagement to provide for; it is only allowed to enjoy &s;uch provi&s;ion as it has made for it&s;elf, in a general way; and when this propo&s;ition is curtailed, whenever a Papi&s;t embraces the Prote&s;tant religion; and the various religious orders and communities are entirely di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of their re&s;pective effects. But it evidently appears from the act, that it is the object of Go|vernment to make provi&s;ion, as fa&s;t as the &s;tate of the country will admit of it,
<Q>for the <HI>encouragement</HI> of the <HI>Prote&s;tant religion,</HI> and for the <HI>maintenance and &s;upport</HI> of a <HI>Pro&s;te&s;tant Clergy.</HI></Q></P>
<P>From what has been offered, the inference is clear, that the Popi&s;h religion is only tolerated in <HI>Canada</HI>; and that it is meant to e&s;tabli&s;h the Prote&s;tant religion in that colony. If, after all, men will confound the meaning of words, and make no di&s;tinction between <HI>toleration</HI> and <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hment,</HI> they degrade them&s;elves in|to the rank of quibblers and praters, and it is lo&s;s of time to di&s;|pute with them.</P>
