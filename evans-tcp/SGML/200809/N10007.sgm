<Q><BIBL>FROM ACTS 4.32.</BIBL>
<P>WHEREIN it is &s;hown, that chri&s;tian churches, in their character as &s;uch, are &s;trongly obliged to evidence the re|ality of their chri&s;tian love, though not by <HI>having all things in common,</HI> yet by making &s;uch provi&s;ion, accord|ing to their ability, for their members in a &s;tate of penury, as that none of them may &s;uffer through want of the things needful for the body; and that DEACONS are officers appointed by Chri&s;t to take care of his poor &s;aints, making all proper di&s;tributions to them in his name, and as enabled hereto by the churches to which they re&s;pectively belong.</P></Q>

<P>THE following &s;ermon is printed at the de&s;ire of &s;ome that heard it preached; thinking it might happily tend to revive in <HI>our churches that &s;pirit of love towards the poor in communion with them,</HI> which was the di&s;tingui&s;hing characteri&s;tic of <HI>chri&s;tian churches</HI> in the fir&s;t age of the go&s;pel. They al&s;o hop|ed, that a publication of this nature might lead DEACONS into clear and ju&s;t &s;entiments of the <HI>nature</HI> and <HI>importance</HI> of their office, and churches into as ju&s;t ones re&s;pecting their obligations to fill their hands for di&s;tributions to Chri&s;t's poor, as they are able, and there may be calls for it in the go|verning providence of God.</P>
<P>THEY, accordingly, recommend it to the &s;erious peru&s;al, e&s;pecially, of <HI>Deacons,</HI> and the <HI>Churches</HI> to which they are re|lated; humbly leaving it with the "God of love" to give it de&s;ired Succe&s;s.</P>

<Q><BIBL><HI>ACTS 4.32.</HI></BIBL>
<P>"And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart, and of one &s;oul: neither &s;aid any of them, that ought of the things which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed were his own; but they had all things in common."</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THERE is no need&punc; in order to introduce a di&s;cour&s;e on the&s;e words, to take into previous con|&s;ideration either the preceeding, or following context. They are an independent &s;entence, containing an account of the temper and conduct of the chri&s;tian church at Jeru&s;alem, in the beginning of the apo&s;tolic times. Says the in&s;pired writer, they "were of one heart, and of one &s;oul, and had all things in common".</P>
<P>WHAT I propo&s;e is, to dilate upon the&s;e words, that we may be let in a clear and ju&s;t under&s;tanding of them; and, as I go along, to make the proper
<PB N="6" REF="012717_0005_0F8BC3238B838A50">
reflections upon what may be exhibited as their real truth.</P>
<P>THEY begin, "and the multitude of them that believed".&mdash;The per&s;ons here &s;poken of were "believers"; that is, converts to the chri&s;tian faith. And they were converts from <HI>Judai&s;m.</HI> For the go&s;pel had not as yet been preached to the Gentile nations. The apo&s;tles, it is true, had, before this time, been commi&s;&s;ioned by their Lord "to preach, in his name, repentance, and remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins, among ALL NATIONS," as we read in Luk. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">4.47: But they were expre&s;sly ordered, in the words that immediately follow, to begin their mini&s;try, in execution of their commi&s;&s;ion, "at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI>; and to tarry there until they had been endued with power from on high"; that is, with miraculous power from the Holy Gho&s;t.</P>
<P>WHY our Lord confined the labours of his apo&s;tles, for a while, within &s;o narrow a compa&s;s as the city of Jeru&s;alem, after he had commi&s;&s;ioned them to preach the go&s;pel to all the world, may be difficult to &s;ay. But could nothing el&s;e be &s;aid, it would be abundantly &s;ufficient, at lea&s;t to us who call our &s;elves chri&s;tians, to &s;ay, "So it &s;eemed good in his &s;ight".</P>
<P>I MAY, with propriety, add here, it was an ho|nor, a &s;ignal honor, to the city of Jeru&s;alem, and to the Jewi&s;h nation in common, that the fir&s;t chri&s;tian church &s;hould con&s;i&s;t of <HI>Jews,</HI> and be ga|thered at <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI> And, at the &s;ame time, it illu&s;trates that interrogatory appeal of the apo&s;tle Paul, in the fir&s;t ver. of the 11th chapter of his epi&s;tle to the Romans, "hath God ca&s;t away his
<PB N="7" REF="012717_0006_0F8BC3244300C898">
people"? Upon which he adds, "God forbid"! As if he had &s;aid, God hath not <HI>wholly</HI> "ca&s;t away his people". No; a number of them were believers in Chri&s;t, the promi&s;ed Me&s;&s;iah, and &s;o con&s;idera|ble a number, that they might be called "a multi|tude". So &s;peaks the text.</P>
<P>"THE <HI>multitude</HI> of them that believed". And it is with great propriety that they are thus deno|minated. "About an hundred and twenty" only, it is true, was the number at fir&s;t, as we read in the 1&s;t chapter of the Acts; but, after the de|&s;cent of the holy Gho&s;t upon the apo&s;tles, in mira|culous gifts, they were greatly increa&s;ed. "Three thou&s;and were added to them", in con&s;equence of one &s;ermon, preached by the apo&s;tle Peter, the re|cord of which we have in the 2d chapter of Acts. In the chapter in which is my text, ver. 4, their number is &s;aid to be "about five thou&s;and". And in the next chapter, v. 14, we read, that "believers were added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women". This increa&s;e of believers was at Jeru&s;alem, and of tho&s;e who were converted from Judai&s;m.</P>
<P>I MAY properly take occa&s;ion here to reflect with grief upon the &s;tate of the church of Chri&s;t at pre&s;ent, with re&s;pect to the additions that are made to it of tho&s;e that "believe," &s;o believe as that they "&s;hall be &s;aved". It cannot be now &s;aid, as in my text, "the multitude of them that believed". Ble&s;&s;ed be God, there is yet a church of Chri&s;t, and there are in it believers in truth, believers unto life; and this, whether we con&s;ider the church in general, or as con&s;tituted of particular individual
<PB N="8" REF="012717_0007_0F8BC3250AFC35C8">
churches&punc; But the increa&s;e of converts is not now as it was when the apo&s;tles went forth in the power of the Spirit of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. There is at this day, and has been for a long time, yea for ages, an awful withdraw of that &s;ucce&s;s, which, in the apo&s;tolic days, attended the preaching of the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t. Notwith&s;tanding the revivals of the &s;pirit of chri&s;tia|nity at particular times, and in &s;ome particular places, the cau&s;e, in general, has been long langui&s;hing, and is, at pre&s;ent, in a &s;ad, decaying, and almo&s;t dead condition.</P>
<P>IT certainly is &s;o in this Town and Land.&mdash; How &s;mall is the number of tho&s;e, who give them|&s;elves up to God in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to walk in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord, with a becoming care of being blamele&s;s? We are vi&s;ibly under great decays as to the life of religion. With what little &s;ucce&s;s are the means of grace ac|companied? What an awful unconcernedne&s;s does there appear in all &s;orts of per&s;ons about their &s;ouls, and the concerns of another world? How great is the luke-warmne&s;s and indifferency, even of chri&s;|tian profe&s;&s;ors? How general their &s;piritual &s;loth and negligence? And how many, what va&s;t multi|tudes among us, are &s;ecure in their &s;ins, unmindful of God, thoughtle&s;s of Chri&s;t, allowing them&s;elves to "walk in the way of their own heart, and in the &s;ight of their eyes"? Let us not be in&s;en&s;ible of the lamentably bad &s;tate of religion among us. Let us be humble herefor, and &s;eek to God to "pour out his &s;pirit" upon us, to "revive the things that remain, and are ready to die" We cannot unite in a more &s;ea&s;onable, pertinent prayer to the
<PB N="9" REF="012717_0008_0F8BC32607368308">
God of all grace than that, "Turn thou us again, O Lord God of ho&s;ts, cau&s;e thy face to &s;hine, and we &s;hall be &s;aved".</P>
<P>THE text goes on, "they were of one heart, and of one &s;oul". This may re&s;pect their unity in <HI>&s;entiment</HI> as well as <HI>affection.</HI> Such was their faith and &s;uch their love, that it might be &s;aid, they, had, as it were, "one &s;oul". There were no di&s;pu|tings among them, no &s;trife, no animo&s;ity. And, in&s;tead of hatred, they were filled with good will towards each other, &s;hewing its reality in all the genuine exerci&s;es of chri&s;tian kindne&s;s. They were in judgment, and affection, the &s;ame as if they had been animated with one common &s;pirit.</P>
<P>THEY were one in <HI>&s;entiment,</HI> that is, with re&s;pect to the divine mi&s;&s;ion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, his being the Me&s;&s;iah, and the only Saviour of men. This was the grand truth the apo&s;tles in&s;i&s;ted on in their preaching, particularly in my context; and this, accordingly, was the great object of the faith of this "multitude". They embraced it as a &s;ure truth, that Je&s;us who "had been crucified, and was rai&s;ed from the dead", was "the Son of God"; and they were as "one" in this faith.</P>
<P>HAPPY this fir&s;t chri&s;tian church, &s;o united in that faith which is the grand foundation of the reli|gion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t! Happy, that they &s;hould, as "one" build, as the language of my context is, upon "the &s;tone &s;et at nought" by &s;o many of the jewi&s;h builders, and that God had made the head of the corner; in whom there "is &s;alvation, and in no other".</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="012717_0009_0F8BC32A788E8FB8">THIS is the great band of chri&s;tian union, that "unity in faith", which is recommended in the new-te&s;tament writings, and which was exemplified by the fir&s;t chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>It were to be wi&s;hed, tho&s;e who profe&s;s them|&s;elves chri&s;tians, would pre&s;erve this unity in the bond of peace. Then would they cea&s;e from for|ming them&s;elves into &s;eparate communities, on account of tho&s;e differences in opinion which enter not into the e&s;&s;ence of chri&s;tianity, but are rather points of doubtful di&s;putation. Then would the church of Chri&s;t be no longer a collection of contend|ing &s;ects, and party combinations, but "one body", cemented together, and united, not in the &s;ame &s;entiments about tything mint, annice, and cum|ming, or any other matters of comparatively &s;mall importance; but in that faith without which no man can be a chri&s;tian, a chri&s;tian in &s;uch a &s;en&s;e as that he may have good hope of entering into life eternal. This is the unity in &s;entiment, the onene&s;s in faith, that is worthy to be de&s;ired, pray|ed for, and &s;ought after, by all that are the friends of Chri&s;t, and the intere&s;t of his religion.</P>
<P>THIS multitude of primitive believers, were not only "one" in &s;entiment, but "one" in <HI>affection</HI> al&s;o. With re&s;pect to love, it might be &s;aid of them, they had, as it were, but "one heart, and one &s;oul". They loved one another as they loved them&s;elves; "yea, as Chri&s;t loved them". Their love was without di&s;&s;imulation. It was not a pretence only, a meer empty verbal compliment; but a noble reality, appearing to be &s;o by its operation in all the fruits of true chri&s;tian benevolence. They "walked in love, even as Chri&s;t Je&s;us al&s;o walked".
<PB N="11" REF="012717_0010_0F8BC32B50689B78">
They "abounded in love", both as an inward af|fection, and in all tho&s;e outward acts that are the proper di&s;coveries of &s;uch an affection. And it was eminently in this way that the&s;e fir&s;t believers, and others al&s;o in after days, drew the attention, and excited the admiration, even of tho&s;e who were unbelievers: for they have been heard to &s;ay, as their words are recorded by one and another of the ancient writers, "Behold, how the chri&s;tians love one another! How chearfully, how liberally, they do good to one another"!</P>
<P>AN example this, highly worthy of the imitati|on of all who would be owned, another day, as the followers of tho&s;e who inherited that &s;pirit, which was the peculiar glory of our common Ma&s;ter and Saviour. The law of love is eminently the law of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and we are obliged as chri&s;tians to nothing, if we are not under &s;olemn bonds to love one another. Love, in the fir&s;t times of the go&s;pel, was wrought into the very frame of the &s;ouls of believers; and this they evidenced by their readine&s;s to all the offices of chri&s;tian kindne&s;s to|wards each other.&mdash;How different are mo&s;t chri&s;tians now from what they were then! Can it be &s;aid, even of tho&s;e of the &s;ame communion, that they are as "one" in affection? May we not rather take to our &s;elves words, and lament the flight of that &s;pirit of love, which was once the di&s;tingui&s;hing mark of tho&s;e who were believers in Chri&s;t!</P>
<P>IT is further added in my text, "neither &s;aid any of them that ought of the things which he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed was his own; but they had all things in common". The things here &s;aid to be "had in common" mu&s;t not be under&s;tood as extending to
<PB N="12" REF="012717_0011_0F8BC32BBA40AC88">
a community in every thing. Such an explanation of the words would be an ab&s;urdity in rea&s;on, and a direct contradiction to the precepts of revelation. They ought therefore to be limited to &s;uch things only as might, in con&s;i&s;tency with the rule of duty, be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed and enjoyed in common. The in&s;pired writer of my text has accordingly taken care to &s;picify particularly "the things they had in com|mon". Says he, in the following 34th and 3<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">th ver&s;es, "as many as were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of lands, or hou&s;es, &s;old them, and brought the prices of the things that were &s;old, and laid them down at the apo&s;tles feet; and di&s;tribution was made to every man according as he had need". To the like pur|po&s;e, having &s;aid, in the 2d chapter of this &s;ame book of the Acts, ver. 4<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">, "all that believed had all things in common", he goes on, in the next ver. to give us a di&s;tinct and full account of "the thing" he had &s;aid "believers had in common". His words are, "and &s;old their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and goods; and parted them to all men, as every man had need". It was therefore the worldly e&s;tate, the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed hou&s;es and lands, of the&s;e believers, turned into money, that they all had the benefit of in com|mon. There is nothing &s;aid, from whence it can be collected, that the&s;e believers enjoyed, or countenanc|ed the enjoyment of any thing in common, that would infer a violation of the bonds tho&s;e are under, who, as the &s;cripture &s;peaks, are no longer "twain, but my&s;tically one in the Lord". Some may have in|terpreted this example of the&s;e fir&s;t chri&s;tians in &s;uch a latitude. But it may, without the lea&s;t he|&s;itation, be &s;aid, it was never &s;o interpreted, unle&s;s
<PB N="13" REF="012717_0012_0F8BC32C8766B2F8">
by tho&s;e, who&s;e eyes were blinded by the ri&s;e of im|pure mi&s;ts from a gro&s;ly carnalized heart.</P>
<P>THE only que&s;tion of any importance here is, were chri&s;tians, from the beginning, and all along to this day, obliged, in virtue of this example of the believers at Jeru&s;alem, to &s;ell their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and put all in one &s;tock for the common benefit of all? Some have imagined, that an affirmative an|&s;wer to this que&s;tion is the true one; but upon in|&s;ufficient rea&s;on. And this I &s;hall endeavour, in as conci&s;e a manner as I can, to make evident to you. In order whereto let it be ob&s;erved,</P>
<P>THESE believers, con&s;tituting the church at Je|ru&s;alem, were not obliged, in con&s;equence of any apo&s;tolic command, to make &s;ale of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|ons, that they might have all things in common. We have no account of &s;uch a command. And &s;hould any affirm there was one, they would only declare their own imagination, not what is any where wrote in the in&s;pired books. Nay, in&s;tead of being divinely taught, that the&s;e believers were commanded to &s;ell their e&s;tates, that they might all live in common upon one &s;tock, we are obviou&s;ly led to think, that they were every one left at liber|ty to do in this matter as they judged to be right and fit. To this purpo&s;e are tho&s;e words of the apo&s;tle Peter, in the chapter following my text, ver. 4, which he &s;pake to Ananias with a direct re|ference to the &s;ale he had made of his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; "while it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was &s;old, was it not in thy own power"? Surely, he would not have &s;aid this, he could not have &s;aid it with propriety, or truth, if Ananias had been under the obligation of a command from Chri&s;t,
<PB N="14" REF="012717_0013_0F8BC32D40D4C0D8">
conveyed by his apo&s;tles, to part with his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and put the price into the common &s;tock. Upon this &s;uppo&s;ition, how could his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion be &s;o cal|led "his own" as that he might not have &s;old it? and when he had &s;old it, how could the price of it be &s;aid to have been "in his own power"? It &s;hould &s;eem demon&s;trable, from this application of the apo&s;tle Peter to Ananias, that the &s;ale which the&s;e believers at Jeru&s;alem made of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, was a matter of their own free choice, not what they were ab&s;olutely bound to do in virtue of any require|ment of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>AND we may the rather be &s;atisfied of this, as we no where read, in the new-te&s;tament, of any chri&s;tian church, who "had all things in common", conformable to the example of the church at Jeru|&s;alem. And what is more, we no where, in the in&s;pired books, find a <HI>command,</HI> directed to any chri&s;tian church, or to any member belonging to it, obliging them to &s;ell their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, that the whole community might be &s;upported out of one common &s;tock; which cannot be accounted for, had it been the will of Chri&s;t, that no one of his di&s;ciples &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s, as his own property, either hou&s;e or land; but that every one, who profe&s;&s;ed faith in him, &s;hould, without the exception of a &s;ingle per&s;on, &s;ell his e&s;tate for the advantage of all in common.</P>
<P>IT may be further worthy of notice, the new-te&s;ta|ment-writers are &s;o far from reducing all chri&s;tians to a level, by putting them upon having all things in common, that they obviou&s;ly &s;uppo&s;e there actu|ally was, and would be, a difference between them in point of outward circum&s;tances. Hence they often &s;peak of the members of this, and the other chri&s;tian
<PB N="15" REF="012717_0014_0F8BC32DF9708F30">
church under the characters of <HI>rich</HI> and <HI>poor</HI>; which would have been altogether improper, if chri&s;tianity had de&s;troyed this di&s;tinction, by obliging all that were believers to have all things in common. And not only do the apo&s;tolic writers &s;peak of <HI>rich</HI> and <HI>poor</HI> in the chri&s;tian church, but graft many of their in&s;tructions upon this difference there was in the worldly circum&s;tances of its members. The <HI>rich,</HI> particularly, are applied to as &s;uch, and minded of the duty they are obliged to in this capacity. Says the apo&s;tle Paul, directing Timothy how to manage in his office as a go&s;pel-mini&s;ter, 1 Tim. 6.<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">7. "charge them that are <HI>rich</HI> in this world that they tru&s;t not in certain riches, but in the living God&mdash; that they do good, and be rich in good works". Where would be the pertinency of this charge to Timothy, if the &s;uppo&s;ition of rich men in the church of Chri&s;t was a contradiction to the go&s;pel e&s;tabli&s;h|ment? In this ca&s;e, the direction to him mu&s;t have been, &s;ay to &s;uch as are rich, &s;ell your po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and cea&s;e being rich. But not a word to this pur|po&s;e do we meet with here, or in any pa&s;&s;age of &s;cripture, in what is &s;aid to them that were rich.</P>
<P>IT is &s;till further ob&s;ervable, the apo&s;tle Paul, in writing to the Corinthian church, as "touching the mini&s;tring to the &s;aints", gives them this in&s;tructi|on, 2. Cor. 9 7. "Every man according as he purpo&s;eth in his heart, &s;o let him give; not grud|gingly, or of nece&s;&s;ity; for God loveth a chearful giver". Is this an injunction that will, in the lea&s;t, comport with the &s;uppo&s;ition, that the individuals of this church had nothing of their own, but had all things in common? Every man, you &s;ee, is left

<P>YOU will, perhaps, a&s;k, if the practice of this fir&s;t chri&s;tian church at Jeru&s;alem, in &s;elling their po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions, and having all things in common, was not intended as an example obligatory on all other chri&s;tian &s;ocieties, why was it recorded? And why &s;o recorded as to lead us into an opinion of their con|duct as truly noble and benevolent?</P>
<P>THE an&s;wer is at once obvious, and I hope &s;atis|factory. It is as follows. This fir&s;t church, at the time when they came into this practice, were pecu|liarly &s;ituated. Perhaps, no church, from that day to this, has been in like circum&s;tances. For it is to be ob&s;erved, though, from the evidence that had been held out to their view, they admitted it into their hearts as a truth, that Je&s;us was the Son of God, and Saviour of the world, that he died, ro&s;e again, a&s;cended up to heaven, and will come in the end of time to confer eternal life upon all his faith|ful followers; and though, in the e&s;teem of the apo&s;tles, they were qualified, in con&s;equence of this

faith, and a profe&s;&s;ion of it, for bapti&s;m, and fellow|&s;hip with believers in all acts of chri&s;tian communi|on; yet it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed, but that, in this beginning of their faith, they &s;hould be imperfectly in&s;tructed in the nature, doctrines, and precepts of the go&s;pel kingdom. Further teaching; yea, a &s;e|ries of it was yet needful. They needed particu|larly to be guarded again&s;t the prejudices, errors, and corruptions of their former unconverted &s;tate, and to be more fully indoctrinated in the things per|taining to the kingdom of God, and Je&s;us Chri&s;t. And this, until a more regular &s;tate of things could be accompli&s;hed, it is at once evident, would take time, and bear hard upon tho&s;e who had nothing to depend upon for a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence but the labor of their hands. Now, in &s;uch a &s;ituation of things, what more nobly benevolent than this conduct of the fir&s;t believers, in having all things in common? E&s;pecially, if it be remembered, as it ought to be, that this church was con&s;tituted chiefly of Jews that were not inhabitants at Jeru&s;alem, but occa&s;ional comers there from a great variety of di&s;tant pla|ces. Hence we read, in the forecited 2d of the Acts, that, among the three thou&s;and Jews, who were added to the church, at this time, there were Par|thians, Medes, Elamites, dwellers in Me&s;opotamia, Judea, Pontus, A&s;ia, and other places. And being thus occa&s;ionally at Jeru&s;alem on the day of Pente|co&s;t, when the holy Gho&s;t made his de&s;cent on the apo&s;|tles, they were eye-witne&s;&s;es of its marvellous effects, and had the opportunity of hearing the &s;ermon then preached by the apo&s;tle Peter, under the in&s;piration of the Spirit; upon which they were &s;truck with
<PB N="18" REF="012717_0017_0F8BC33225174128">
conviction, profe&s;&s;ed faith in Chri&s;t, and were ad|mitted, to fellow&s;hip, as di&s;ciples, in all acts of chri&s;ti|an communion. But being at a great di&s;tance from their proper homes, they were incapable of providing for their own &s;upport, &s;hould they con|tinue at Jeru&s;alem; and yet, it cannot be &s;uppo|&s;ed but that, upon their becoming converts to the faith of Chri&s;t, they &s;hould be de&s;irous of tarrying here, as it was highly proper, if not ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary, they &s;hould, that they might be more ful|ly in&s;tructed in the way of &s;alvation through Je&s;us who was crucified. Be&s;ides, they might, by di|rection from the Holy Gho&s;t, be influenced to con|tinue here, that, being under the tuition of the apo&s;|tles, and enjoying the advantage of chri&s;tian com|munion in go&s;pel ordinances, they might be formed for preachers to carry the glad tidings of &s;alvation to the &s;everal nations from whence they came, and in this way be in&s;trumental in propaga|ting the religion of Je&s;us. In this &s;ituation of things, wherein could the believers at Jeru&s;alem have more nobly manife&s;ted the warmth of their love to Chri&s;t, and the greatne&s;s of their affection for each other, than by &s;aying, as in my text, that "nought of the things which they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed were their own, but that all things &s;hould be had in com|mon"? In like circum&s;tances, the like conduct would be generous and noble, and would be the conduct of chri&s;tians, if actuated by that benevolent principle, which reigned in the&s;e fir&s;t believers, ma|king them all of "one heart, and of one &s;oul". But for any to plead, that this practice of tho&s;e primitive chri&s;tians &s;hould form a law, an e&s;tabli&s;hed
<PB N="19" REF="012717_0018_0F8BC332B5FF3A18">
rule, obligatory upon all chri&s;tians, in all ages, how|ever differently circum&s;tanced, would be highly ab|&s;urd, and greatly hurtful in its tendency and ope|ration.</P>
<P>NEVERTHELESS, this example of their unfeign|edly generous love is very in&s;tructive to chri&s;tians, con&s;idered both <HI>individually,</HI> and as united in <HI>parti|cular &s;ocieties.</HI> It is in this latter view of chri&s;tians, only I &s;hall con&s;ider the example in my text, as eminently in&s;tructive.</P>
<P>AND the in&s;truction they are taught from it is, to take all due care, that &s;uch among them as are in nece&s;&s;itous circum&s;tances, may be &s;o far provided for, as to be pre&s;erved from &s;uffering through want. Though no particular &s;ocieties of chri&s;tians are obli|ged, after the pattern of the church at Jeru&s;alem, to &s;ell what they po&s;&s;e&s;s, and throw all into one &s;tock for the common &s;upport; yet they are, with|out all doubt, bound by their example to do their utmo&s;t, that none of their brethren in Chri&s;t, e&s;pe|cially of the &s;ame community with them&s;elves, may be &s;uffered to drag on life unrelieved under the &s;traits, di&s;tre&s;&s;es&punc; and mi&s;eries of unavoidable pover|ty. And the obligation, from this example, is the more binding, as it co-incides with the known practice of all chri&s;tian churches in apo&s;tolic times. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid.

the&s;e in&s;pired teachers of the will of Chri&s;t. The practice of the&s;e primitive churches, thus circum|&s;tanced, is therefore obligatory upon all after chur|ches; and while they copy after it, they may be a&s;&s;ured, they will fall in with the mind of Chri&s;t, as their practice was founded on apo&s;tolic directi|on, which was infalibly right; becau&s;e they were under the immediate guidance of the Spirit of truth.</P>
<P>The churches of Chri&s;t, it is acknowledged, were differently &s;ituated in that day from what they are in this. They were then the objects of the hatred and contempt of the civil magi&s;trate, not of his paternal care and protection: Whereas the civil powers, in many places at lea&s;t, are now on the &s;ide of chri&s;tian communities, and profe&s;s a re|gard for them, and readine&s;s to afford them their help.</P>
<P>THIS difference between the &s;tate of chri&s;tians now, and in the times of the apo&s;tles, it mu&s;t be owned, is a very great one in favor of chri&s;tian churches at this day. But what is the natural, ob|vious deduction herefrom? Surely, it will not fol|low, that chri&s;tian churches, becau&s;e they are under a chri&s;tian civil magi&s;tracy, are di&s;charged from their obligations to chri&s;tian charity. As our Savior has &s;aid, Mat. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">6.11, "The poor ye have always with you", that is, to furni&s;h occa&s;ions for the ex|erci&s;e of charity, and to call to it. The nece&s;&s;ities of tho&s;e, who are of "the hou&s;hold of faith", may not at all times, and in all places, &s;o loudly call for equally large di&s;tributions in order to their relief: But in all ages, and in all the churches of the &s;aints, there will be a number, more or le&s;s, of helple&s;s

orphans, widows, and poor people, who mu&s;t be provided for, or &s;ubjected to all the mi&s;eries of a de&s;titute condition in life.</P>
<P>BESIDES what has been offered, it may be wor|thy of &s;pecial notice, the apo&s;tles of our Lord, un|der the extraordinary guidance of the Holy Gho&s;t, appointed officers in the chri&s;tian churches they founded, who&s;e &s;pecial bu&s;ine&s;s it was to take care of the charity of the churches they were re&s;pective|ly related to, and to make di&s;tribution of it ac|cording to the various wants of their &s;everal mem|bers. The&s;e officers are called, in the apo&s;tolic writings, DEACONS, and they have been di&s;tingui&s;h|ed by this name from that day to this.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t deacons were con&s;tituted at Jeru&s;alem, and the work a&s;&s;igned them was in part <HI>extraordina|ry,</HI> being adju&s;ted to the <HI>extraordinary circum&s;tances</HI> of the church there. This church, at this time, had one common &s;tock, out of which they were all &s;upplied. Deacons were accordingly appointed to "&s;erve tables" <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See the account at large in the 6th Chapter of the Acts.</NOTE> or, in other words, to make u&s;e of the churches money, which was depo&s;ited in their hands, not only in providing for the <HI>Lord's table,</HI> but &s;uch <HI>other tables</HI> as were nece&s;&s;ary for the com|mon &s;upport.: A work that required great wi&s;dom, impartiality, candor, as well as labor, in order to a right and commendable di&s;charge of it.</P>
<P>That which was <HI>extraordinary</HI> in the work of the&s;e deacons, the &s;upport of all out of one common &s;tock, &s;oon cea&s;ed; but taking care of the helple&s;s poor members of Chri&s;t &s;till continued the duty of every church, and will continue to be their duty to the end of the world. And, upon this
<PB N="22" REF="012717_0021_0F8BC33885729B88">
foundation, the deacon's office became a <HI>perpetual</HI> one in the church. All the churches, in apo&s;tolic times, that were &s;et in order, were furni&s;hed with <HI>Deacons,</HI> as well as Pa&s;tors. Hence the apo&s;tle Paul in&s;cribes his epi&s;tle to the Philippians in that &s;tile, "to all the &s;aints in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, with the Bi|&s;hops&punc; or Pa&s;tors, and <HI>Deacons</HI>". And in his fir&s;t epi&s;tle to Timothy, which was intended for the direc|tion of all churches, in all ages, he particularly &s;pecifies the qualifications of tho&s;e who are fit to be <HI>Deacons,</HI> and gives direction that &s;uch only &s;hould be put into office.</P>
<P>IT is from hence evident, that the Deacon's&punc; office is a <HI>perpetual</HI> one, and that all the churches of Chri&s;t, in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion thro' all ages, &s;hould be furni&s;hed with them. And why? Principally, and above all, that, as tru&s;tees of the churches, and as officers of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, they might employ them|&s;elves in mini&s;tring to the poor &s;aints. But how &s;hould they do this, unle&s;s they be enabled to it? And how &s;hould they be enabled, but from the charitable di&s;tributions of the churches who&s;e offi|cers they re&s;pectively are, under Chri&s;t, the great head over all? The appointment of Deacons to take care, that the poor &s;aints be relieved and helped, is, in true con&s;truction, a &s;olemn law of Chri&s;t, obliging the churches who chu&s;e them to put it in their power, as God &s;hall give ability, to an&s;wer this charitable intention of their office. Surely, this office in the church would not have been con&s;tituted, if it had been a needle&s;s, u&s;ele&s;s one! And u&s;ele&s;s, as to the main end of its in&s;titution, it mu&s;t certainly be, if the churches are not bound, by the authority of
<PB N="23" REF="012717_0022_0F8BC3393B7FFEA0">
Chri&s;t, to a due care to fill their hands for di&s;tri|bution to charitable and pious purpo&s;es. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">My late worthy colleague, the Rev. Mr. Foxcroft, in his &s;ermon preached at the ordination of a Deacon, though dead yet &s;peaks to you, in the following very pertinent words.
<Q>This officer (meaning the Deacon) &s;tands in the hou&s;e of God a con&s;tant monitor to the a&s;&s;embly, of their duty to honour the Lord with their &s;ub&s;tance. And the church, that elect him, do hereby practically contract with him, that they will own him in the execution of his office, find him &s;uitable employment in his &s;tation, and &s;upply him, as they are able, for a liberal di&s;tribution to the nece&s;&s;ities of &s;aints. I cannot but look on it a gro&s;s incongruity, not to &s;ay a trifling formality, and mockery of a divine in&s;titution, to put men, by a &s;olemn church-vote, in the name of God, under the character of <HI>Deacons,</HI> and yet not appoint them over their proper bu&s;ine&s;s", nor take the nece&s;&s;ary methods to furni&s;h them for u&s;ing their office well.</Q>
&mdash;He adds a little onwards
<Q>If the church did their duty "concerning the collection for the &s;aints, every one contributing as God hath pro&s;pered them", there would be a &s;ufficiency of work for the officers Chri&s;t has in&s;tituted to "&s;erve tables." None, methinks, could then, with any colour of rea&s;on, &s;cruple the propriety of a &s;o|lemn ordination of them. And as for them, how would it encourage their hearts, to &s;ee the churches, they re&s;pectively &s;erve, taking a proper care, that they may be "thoroughly furni&s;hed unto all good works" for the hou&s;e of their God, and the offices thereof! How gladly would they receive the gift, and take upon them the fellow&s;hip of mini&s;tring unto the &s;aints!</Q>
&mdash;Thus he.</NOTE></P>
<P>IN &s;hort, either the Deacon's office is an ordi|nance of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, or it is not. If it is not, why do our churches, in &s;olemn form, chu&s;e men out of their number to take upon them this office? They mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to e&s;teem <HI>Deacons,</HI> officers of divine appointment, or they prophanely mock God when they elect them as &s;uch. If they are
<PB N="24" REF="012717_0023_0F8BC33A1BA0FB98">
officers of Chri&s;t's appointment, the churches who chu&s;e them are mo&s;t certainly obliged to acknow|ledge them in this character, by enabling them, as they have ability, to afford all needed help to "the &s;aints that are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us". This is the great end of their appointment; this is the bu&s;ine&s;s in &s;pecial they are &s;et over: And for churches to elect them to manage this bu&s;ine&s;s, and carry into exe|cution this great and good end of their office, and, at the &s;ame time, to take little or no care to furni&s;h them with ability herefor, is an incon&s;i&s;tency in conduct that cannot ea&s;ily be acccounted for. And yet, this incon&s;i&s;tency mo&s;t of our churches are ju&s;tly chargeable with.</P>
<P>IT is I &s;uppo&s;e, the truth, in regard of all our churches, that they have <HI>Deacons,</HI> and of their own election; and this, when &s;olemnly met together in the name of the Lord. And is it not as real a truth, with re&s;pect to the mo&s;t of them, that their <HI>Deacons</HI> &s;u&s;tain rather the <HI>name</HI> of their office, than the thing it&s;elf; having little or nothing to do that is proper to the principal end of their in&s;titution by Chri&s;t? May it not be ju&s;tly &s;aid, that too generally, through|out the land, their main bu&s;ine&s;s is to provide for, and &s;erve at, the &s;acramental table? As for Chri&s;t's poor, they are no more enabled, by the churches they are related to, to make di&s;tributions for their relief, than if they &s;u&s;tained no office in the church of God. Is this as it ought to be? May it not ra|ther be &s;aid, that &s;uch churches are gro&s;ly wanting in tho&s;e di&s;coveries of chri&s;tian affection, which were &s;o con&s;picuous in the church at Jeru&s;alam, and all the other churches we read of in the new-te&s;tament-books.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="012717_0024_0F8BC33ACC443E58">IT will, perhaps, be pleaded here, our civil ru|lers have empowered the &s;everal Towns, within their juri&s;diction, to rai&s;e &s;uch moneys as may be judged nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;upport of the poor, and to appoint per&s;ons to take care, that the&s;e moneys be di&s;po&s;ed of, &s;o as to an&s;wer the good end for which they are rai&s;ed; in con&s;ideration whereof, the churches are excu&s;ed from tho&s;e charities, which would enable their <HI>Deacons</HI> to do that which is done in other ways.</P>
<P>THE an&s;wer is at once obvious. The laws im|powering our &s;everal towns to provide for the &s;up|port of the poor, re&s;pect the <HI>poor in common,</HI> of what|ever denomination, be their character as it may; not di&s;tingui&s;hing any on account of their <HI>member&s;hip in the church of Christ</HI>: Whereas, it is the require|ment of the go&s;pel of the ble&s;&s;ed God, that chri&s;ti|an churches particularly regard the <HI>poor &s;aints</HI>; taking all due care, that tho&s;e, who are members of the &s;ame my&s;tical body with them&s;elves, &s;hould be &s;o far helped as not to live in &s;uffering circum&s;tan|ces, through want of the things that are needful for the body.

the obligations of the churches to make pro|vi&s;ion for <HI>tho&s;e of their own body,</HI> who are in nece&s;&s;i|tous circum&s;tances, it totally &s;ets a&s;ide the <HI>Deacon's office,</HI> though an apo&s;tolic appointment in the name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. What need of <HI>Deacons</HI> in the church of God, if Chri&s;t's poor are not to be the &s;pecial objects of their care? Why &s;hould the churches chu&s;e them into office, if they are excu|&s;ed from putting any thing into their hands for a di&s;tribution for the relief of the <HI>&s;aints</HI>? The plain truth is, no civil con&s;titution can vacate an in&s;ti|tution of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. And as <HI>Deacons</HI> are officers of his appointment, and cho&s;en by the churches as &s;uch, they are &s;olemnly bound, and by their own choice too, in compliance with what they profe&s;&s;ed|led e&s;teem the will of Chri&s;t, to own them in the bu&s;ine&s;s they are called to, and &s;et over, namely, that of mini&s;tring to the wants of tho&s;e, <HI>in &s;pecial,</HI> who are of "the hou&s;hold of faith". And that they may be properly &s;upplied, as officers in the kingdom of Chri&s;t, and in his name, for the exe|cution of the benevolent tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them, it is, without all doubt, the incumbant duty of the churches of which they are re&s;pectively Deacons, to endeavour, as they have ability, to put it in their power to relieve their poor members, as there may be occa&s;ion for, and calls to it, in the alwi&s;e, righ|teous government of providence.</P>
<P>SOME of our churches, thanks be to God, have &s;omething of a &s;tock, or fund, owing to the pious and charitable legacies of tho&s;e, who were con|cerned that the <HI>poor di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t</HI> might, in <HI>his name,</HI> and by <HI>his officers</HI> in the church, be taken

care of. But it will not be pretended, that any fund, in any of our churches, will afford that which is &s;ufficient for the relief of all belonging to them, that are needy and de&s;titute: And what is lacking, this way, ought to be made up in &s;ome other; or even the&s;e churches will fall greatly &s;hort of their duty, and leave their Deacons unable to an&s;wer, in a commendable mea&s;ure, the good intention of their office.</P>
<P>WHAT &s;ome individuals in our churches have done, or may &s;till do, in charities to the poor in ge|neral, or the poor of tho&s;e chri&s;tian communities of which they them&s;elves are a part, is known to God, and their own con&s;ciences. But may it not be ju&s;t|ly que&s;tioned, whether any of our churches, AS SUCH, have taken that care to enable their Deacons, as Chri&s;t's officers, and in his behalf, to make tho&s;e communications to his needy di&s;ciples, as they had ability to do, and ought to have done? Had the con&s;tituent members of our &s;everal churches been as ready to communicate, that their brethren in Chri&s;t, conflicting with the mi&s;eries of poverty, might be relieved and helped, as they have been to expend their money for that which profiteth not, would &s;o many of them have &s;o often been pinch|ed with hunger, and cold, and &s;uffered to groan under di&s;tre&s;s, through want, I do not &s;ay of the conveniences and comforts, but of even the nece&s;&s;a|ries of life? Should I not &s;peak the truth, if I &s;hould affirm, that no vi&s;ible &s;aint, no member in any of our churches, would &s;uffer for want of what is needful for the body, if we &s;pared for their relief a &s;mall part only of that which is laid out for rich

furniture for our hou&s;es, in co&s;tly apparel to deck our bodies, and in luxurious variety to cover our ta|bles? Should each one that is a member of the church of Chri&s;t lay his hand upon his heart, and declare the genuine dictates of con&s;cience, would he not be obliged to own, that he had needle&s;sly, might I not &s;ay &s;infully, &s;pent that, which, if he had laid up in &s;tore for the purpo&s;es of charity and pie|ty, would have made the hearts of many to &s;ing for joy, who have been oppre&s;&s;ed, and over-burden|ed with the weight of difficulties and &s;traits, ari&s;ing from the poverty of their condition? Our chur|ches, my brethren, have lo&s;t, in a great mea&s;ure, the &s;pirit of the primitive churches of Chri&s;t; their &s;pirit of love, operating in all the offices of chari|table goodne&s;s, which di&s;tingui&s;hed them from other men, and were as a mark, or badge, by which they were known to be believers in him whom God has &s;ent to be the Savior of the world. We are too generally become lovers of our&s;elves, lovers of the gaities, the vanities, the amu&s;ements, and fa&s;hiona|ble follies of the degenerate age we live in. The very be&s;t of us are too much conformed to this pre|&s;ent evil world, and &s;uffer it &s;o to engro&s;s our affec|tion, as that we have but little, very little, left to &s;hew it &s;elf in chri&s;tian acts of kindne&s;s and benefi|cence to the &s;aints that are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</P>
<P>IT were to be wi&s;hed our churches were now, as they were in the apo&s;tles days, "one in heart and affection", churches towards each other, and every church towards every member belonging to it. And that we may be "provoked" to this union in love, evidencing its reality in works of kindne&s;s

and charity, as their may be occa&s;ion, I &s;hall briefly propo&s;e to your con&s;ideration the following things, with the mentioning of which I &s;hall conclude the pre&s;ent di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t thing worthy of &s;pecial notice is, that the faith which con&s;titutes men chri&s;tians in truth, and love to their fellow-brethren in Chri&s;t, not the pretence of love, but its reality, are &s;o far con|nected together in the &s;acred books, as to lead us mo&s;t obviou&s;ly into the thought, that they are, and ought always to be, in&s;eperable concomitants. Turn to what Paul &s;ays to the church in Ephe&s;us, 1&s;t chap. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> ver. To the like purpo&s;e he writes to the church at Colo&s;&s;, 1&s;t chap. 4th ver. The &s;ame connection of love we find, in his 1&s;t Epi&s;. to the The&s;&s;alonians 1&s;t chap. 3 ver. So in his 2d epi&s;t. 1 chap. 3d ver. I might refer you to a great number of other texts, in which faith in Chri&s;t, and love to the brethren, the &s;aints, the hou&s;hold of faith, are linked together, as though they could not be disjoined, but would ever accompany each other. And, in truth, it is of the very e&s;&s;ence of faith, that faith by which "the ju&s;t do live", to &s;hew it&s;elf in love, not only to God, and Chri&s;t, but to the chri&s;tian brotherhood, not in word only, but in true genuine deeds of unfeigned hearty affecti|on; in&s;omuch, that we may a&s;&s;ure our&s;elves, if our faith is not accompanied with this practical love, it is nothing better than that empty dead faith, of which the apo&s;tle James &s;ays, "it profiteth not".</P>
<P>IT may be again worthy of con&s;ideration, the apo&s;|tolical writers pre&s;ent to the view of believers in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, &s;uch an idea of their relation to each
<PB N="30" REF="012717_0029_0F8BC34453CC34F0">
other as mu&s;t powerfully tend to excite and draw forth their love to one another, if their faith is of the right &s;ort, and in exerci&s;e. As the apo&s;tle Paul, in the 2d chap of his epi&s;t. to the Ephe&s;. repre&s;ents the matter, we have "one Lord, one faith, one bap|ti&s;m, one God and father of all, who is above all, and thro' all, and in all" that are di&s;ciples in truth. We have all been "called to one hope", we are "one my&s;tical body", and are actuated by one and the &s;ame &s;pirit, the Spirit of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. We are all "heirs according to the hope of eternal life, heirs of God, and joint heirs with Chri&s;t to the in|corruptible inheritance in heaven". We expect to be a&s;&s;ociated in another world, and to live there, in one grand community, united in love to one another; and eternally joining as one in "a&s;crib|ing ble&s;&s;ing and honor to him that &s;itteth on the throne, and to the Lamb". Can we have a reali&s;ing faith in the&s;e truths of God, as we mu&s;t have to denominate us chri&s;tians, and not feel in our hearts the working of affection towards each other; affection that will &s;hew it&s;elf in all chri&s;tian offices of charitable kindne&s;s? It is impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>IT may be &s;aid yet farther, the go&s;pel-motives to chri&s;tian love, in practice, as well as principle, are &s;uch as cannot ea&s;ily be with&s;tood, where there is the ex|erci&s;e of faith in a &s;uitable degree. We are called to no act of love and goodne&s;s to the di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t, but what we &s;hall be abundantly rewarded for in the coming world. A cup of cold water only given to a di&s;ciple, in the name of a di&s;ciple, and from love to Chri&s;t, and in obedience to him, &s;hall in no wi&s;e lo&s;e its reward. The more
<PB N="31" REF="012717_0030_0F8BC34477B323D8">
bountifully we &s;ow, the more bountifully we &s;hall reap.&mdash;What better u&s;e, what higher in|tere&s;t, can we put our money to, than by lend|ing it to the Lord, for the u&s;e of his poor? It is the intire want of faith, or the weakne&s;s of it, or the not allowing it its proper exerci&s;e, that &s;huts our hands from the mo&s;t liberal di&s;tributions to the purpo&s;es of chri&s;tian charity. Could we be wan|ting upon this head, if we really and fully believed, that the good God would amply repay us whatever we &s;hould advance for the help of the &s;aints, if not in this world, mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly in that which is to come.</P>
<P>ANOTHER mo&s;t powerfully affecting con&s;ide|ration to engage our practical love towards our brethren in Chri&s;t is, that he will e&s;teem what we do to them as if done to him&s;elf. For they are members of that very body of which he is the Head; they are my&s;tically one with him. It is in con&s;ideration of this union, that he &s;ays, as in the 24th of Matthew, "ina&s;|much as ye have done it to one of the lea&s;t of the&s;e my brethren ye have done it to me". Do we really believe, that, if we charitably re|lieve a brother in Chri&s;t, he will accept the kindne&s;s as done to him&s;elf? It is difficult to conceive, how we &s;hould, in this ca&s;e, refrain our|&s;elves herefrom. Our faith in this amazing truth mu&s;t be weak, or rather not in pre&s;ent exerci&s;e, or it would open both our hearts and hands in comuni|cations of chri&s;tian kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>I SHALL only &s;ay further, deeds of cha|ritable goodne&s;s to the poor &s;uffering members

of the church of Chri&s;t, are mentioned by name in the account the &s;cripture gives us of the proce&s;s of the great and general judgment; and tho&s;e only are pronounced "ble&s;&s;ed, and bid to inherit the kingdom prepared before the foun|dation of the world, who have given meat to the hungry, and drink to the thir&s;ty, cloaths to the naked, and help to the &s;ick, and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed". If then we would hope to be acquitted at the bar of the future judgment, and have entrance mini&s;tred to us into the kingdom of Chri&s;t that is above, we mu&s;t put on bowels of mercy, be kind to one another, tender-hearted, ever being in readine&s;s, according to our ability, to do good to "the hou&s;hold of faith": So &s;hall we, of the mercy of God, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, be crowned with immortality and honour in the coming world.</P>
