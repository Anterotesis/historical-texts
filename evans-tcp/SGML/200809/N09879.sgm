<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>I HAD not well arrived in <HI>America,</HI> when ca&s;ting my eyes on &s;o many Black Slaves, I immediately found a warm incli|nation ari&s;e in my brea&s;t, to do my endeavours for relieving them by publi&s;hing to the world my &s;entiments upon their &s;tate.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="012572_0008_0F8B147B29B46828">SCARCE had I time to draw a breath of this air, before I imme|diately applied my&s;elf to enquire into the &s;tate of this <HI>Slavery,</HI> and the con&s;titution upon which it is founded, and having met with proper preliminaries by way of foundation for a &s;mall Treati&s;e, I &s;et my&s;elf to work in forming, and in &s;hort fini&s;hed this Pamphlet.</P>
<P>FROM the con&s;ideration of the &s;mallne&s;s of this production, and my inability to treat the &s;ubject properly, I was nigh re&s;olving not to prefix my name hereto: But thinking again, &s;ome oppo&s;ite par|ty might take hold of that, I thought it mo&s;t proper to &s;hew my common &s;ignature, knowing
<PB N="xi" REF="012572_0009_0F8B147BF40634F0">
the cau&s;e I defend is good and well founded.</P>
<P>SOME will no doubt be &s;urpri&s;ed that I have wrote this Di&s;&s;ua&s;ion after the form of a Sermon: It is ea&s;ily accounted for. A Sermon being <HI>a di&s;cour&s;e of in&s;truction pro|nounced by a Divine for the edifica|tion of the people.</HI> I am no Divine nor ever expect to be; but I hope that is no rea&s;on why the&s;e &s;heets &s;hould not be of publick benefit, as my de&s;ign was for that end; I cho&s;e to write it in this form, as being the true&s;t way to di&s;play with per&s;picuity and plainne&s;s the unlawfulne&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of the Slave Trade, for which purpo&s;e I have attempted it in different heads and branches, in &s;ome of which
<PB N="xii" REF="012572_0010_0F8B147CCBA0A388">
are contained many pertinent re|marks or ob&s;ervations on this in|human Commerce; and I thought further, it was the ea&s;ie&s;t method for my&s;elf, and plaine&s;t for my Readers; it being intended for the weake&s;t and highe&s;t capacities.</P>
<P>IT may be objected by &s;ome, that the writings on this &s;ubject are too numerous already. I an&s;wer, that however many there may be ex|tant, (although I could find but very few) yet there are none &s;o full as not to admit of amendments or improvements: If &s;o, and that the&s;e may not altogether be of incon&s;iderable u&s;e to man|kind, why may not I make them? and why may they not be tran&s;|mitted to mankind?</P>
<P><PB N="xiii" REF="012572_0011_0F8B147D799180C8">A TREATISE of this kind may not be unnece&s;&s;ary, notwith&s;tand|ing many Books, Pamphlets, and Letters have been publi&s;hed on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>BUT however ineffectual this Treati&s;e may prove hereafter a|mong men, this I comfort my&s;elf with, it is as full, con&s;idering the largene&s;s, as any upon the &s;ub|ject which I have &s;een; and there are few arguments that po&s;&s;ibly could be advanced, or citations drawn from Scripture concerning man-&s;elling, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that have e&s;caped, in trying to wean men from this ba&s;e and inhuman trade. And in fine, if this Work meets with encou|ragement equal to the Author's care and endeavours to make it
<PB N="xiv" REF="012572_0012_0F8B147E2F488DA0">
the mo&s;t u&s;eful of the kind, by having the de&s;ired effect he &s;hall e&s;teem him&s;elf &s;ufficiently re|warded.</P>
<P>WITH regard to the Di&s;&s;ua&s;ion, I leave the Reader to judge, after having read it over cooly and im|partially, whether it ought to be approved or di&s;approved; if the former, it will no doubt meet with his protection in publick. But I have &s;omething to a&s;k, which I beg may not be refu&s;ed, and that is, if you have not a fund of pa|tience laid up in &s;tore, before you begin to peru&s;e it, you are reque&s;t|ed to lay it a&s;ide, until you have.</P>
<P>THERE is one &s;mall part of it taken from <HI>Po&s;tlethwayt</HI>'s Dictio|nary

of Commerce. Another part from <HI>A. Benezett</HI>'s Caution to <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and her Colonies, both which Authors I am very glad were born before me, they having a&s;&s;i&s;ted me &s;o far. And with regard to the remaining part, I can tell where it came from.</P>
<P>AS it is nece&s;&s;ary in order to bring about a change in any, par|ticularly a publick affair, to touch the minds of the people with a ju&s;t and true &s;en&s;e of the unlaw|fulne&s;s of the thing wanted to be removed, that to the end they may be unanimous in the abo|li&s;hment thereof; this Di&s;&s;ua|&s;ion I am convinced you will find upon peru&s;al, is calculated for that purpo&s;e, and am very &s;en&s;i|ble,
<PB N="xvi" REF="012572_0014_0F8B14811242CE00">
that it alone never can &s;trike the great blow without the legi&s;|lative force added to it.</P>
<P>I WILL detain you no longer; indeed I have almo&s;t run into an Introduction amid&s;t this Preface: But it could not well be other|wi&s;e, the connexion between them was &s;o great, and had I &s;e|parated them, I &s;hould have in|curred your di&s;plea&s;ure, by in|crea&s;ing the Prolegomenas to a degree larger than the Di&s;&s;ua&s;ion it&s;elf.</P>

<HEAD>A DISSUASION, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE &s;ubject of which the&s;e few &s;heets treat, would have been one of the la&s;t I &s;hould have ventured upon, had not the delu&s;ion of the men who are concerned in en&s;laving the people called <HI>Negroes</HI> appeared &s;o glaring, and the con|tradiction that the <HI>Slave Trade</HI> bears to Chri&s;tianity, prompted me to it.</P>
<P>I SHALL be as cool and impartial in treating of this matter, as any Briti&s;h &s;ubject or Chri&s;tian can: But why do I &s;ay cool? It is impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hould &s;peak cooly of &s;uch ba&s;e, unchri&s;tian, and inhuman practices, in a land of Liberty and Chri&s;tianity: However, in ca&s;e any thing &s;hould be mentioned in the &s;equel that may give unintended offence to any per&s;on, I hope the tender feelings for the&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Captives, with which I am po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and the warmth that is in my brea&s;t, to have this Trade aboli&s;hed, will be &s;ufficient excu&s;e.</P>
<P>I PROPOSE dividing the following Trea|ti&s;e into the&s;e different heads.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="18" REF="012572_0016_0F8B14829EFC76F0">I. SHEW, that this cu&s;tom of making Slaves of our fellow-men, is expre&s;&s;ly again&s;t the revealed laws of God.</P>
<P N="2">II. THAT it is likewi&s;e again&s;t the law of nature, and the Charter of this Province.</P>
<P N="3">III. The di&s;advantages ari&s;ing from this ba&s;e Trade.</P>
<P N="4">IV. THE advantages ari&s;ing from aboli&s;hing it. And,</P>
<P N="5">V. CONCLUDE with a &s;hort admoni|tion to tho&s;e concerned, and a method to put the Trade to <HI>Africa</HI> on a ju&s;t and lawful footing.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t-head was, That the cu&s;tom of making Slaves of our fellow creatures, is expre&s;&s;ly again&s;t the revealed laws of GOD. And in treating of this part, I &s;hall divide it into the following branch|es. 1&s;t. By the laws of GOD, <HI>He that &s;teal|eth and &s;elleth a man, &s;hall be put to death.</HI> 2d. <HI>He in who&s;e hands he &s;hall be found, &s;hall be put to death,</HI> by the &s;ame laws. 3d. <HI>He that buyeth a Servant and &s;erveth him &s;ix years, &s;hall &s;et him free the &s;e|venth, and furni&s;h him liberally with what he hath.</HI> And 4th. <HI>If thy Brother,</HI> that is, your fellow-creature, <HI>be &s;old
<PB N="19" REF="012572_0017_0F8B1482C5891570">
unto thee, thou &s;hall not compel him to &s;erve as a Bond-man; but as an hired Servant.</HI></P>
<P>THE fir&s;t branch under this head is, <HI>He that &s;tealeth and &s;elleth a man, &s;hall be put to death.</HI> This is one of the mo&s;t expre&s;s laws of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> as you may &s;ee in <HI>Exod.</HI> xxi. 16, two fir&s;t, and la&s;t clau&s;es of the ver&s;e, there mentioned in the mo&s;t peremptory words; <HI>And he that &s;tealeth a man, and &s;elleth him, &s;hall &s;urely be put to death.</HI> It certainly can be looked upon in no other light in the Merchants and Ship-ma&s;ters who are in this Trade to <HI>Africa,</HI> than &s;tealing of men, being acce&s;&s;ary to, and aiding in inciting them to war one with another, and for this purpo&s;e, &s;upplying them with prodigious quantities of arms and ammunition, whereby they are hurried in|to confu&s;ion, blood&s;hed, and all the ex|tremities of temporal mi&s;ery, which mu&s;t con&s;equently beget in their minds &s;uch a general dete&s;tation and &s;corn of the Chri&s;tian name, as may deeply affect, if not wholly preclude, their belief of the great truths of our holy religion. Thus an in&s;atiable de&s;ire of gain prevails with their Kings, who, in&s;tead of being protectors of their people, for this alluring

bait laid before them, by the <HI>European</HI> and <HI>American</HI> Factors, or Ship-ma&s;ters, invade the Liberties of the&s;e unhappy people, and occa&s;ion their opre&s;&s;ion. The&s;e Kings, whenever they want goods &s;end to the Ship-ma&s;ters, acquainting them they have Negroes, and &s;ometimes the Factors and Ship-ma&s;ters &s;end to ac|quaint them, that they have a quanti|ty of goods, and want Slaves for the &s;ame. The&s;e Chiefs, whether they have Slaves then or not, agree, and immedi|ately go to war with their neighbours, and in procuring three or four hundred pri&s;oners, burn five or &s;ix towns, as appears by the following extract from a Surgeon's Journal in a <HI>Liverpool</HI> ve&s;&s;el.</P>

<P>HERE follows another relation taken from an original Journal of a Surgeon who &s;ailed out of <HI>New-York,</HI>
<Q>Being on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Guinea</HI> at a place called <HI>Ba&s;alia,</HI> the Commander of the ve&s;&s;el, according to cu&s;tom, &s;ent a per&s;on on &s;hore, with a pre&s;ent to the King, acquainting him with his arrival, and informing him they wanted a cargo of Slaves. The King promi&s;ed to furni&s;h them, and in order to do it, &s;et out to war again&s;t his enemies; de&s;igning al&s;o to &s;urpri&s;e &s;ome town, and take all

the people pri&s;oners: Some time af|ter, the King &s;ent them word, he had not yet met with the de&s;ired &s;ucce&s;s, having been twice repul&s;ed in at|tempting to break up two towns; but that he &s;till hoped to procure a number of Slaves for them, and in this de&s;ign per&s;i&s;ted, until he met his enemies in the field, where a battle was fought, which la&s;ted three days, dur|ing which time, the engagement was &s;o bloody that four thou&s;and five hun|dred men were &s;lain on the &s;pot. Think (&s;ays he) what a pitiful &s;ight it was to &s;ee the Widows weeping over their lo&s;t Hu&s;bands, Orphans deploring the lo&s;s of their Fathers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q>
Oh! &s;hock|ing &s;pectacles! to &s;ee four or five towns burnt, and four thou&s;and five hundred people killed, for the &s;ake of taking three or four hundred, and you! you! Mer|chants, Ship-ma&s;ters and Factors the cau&s;e of it all! Think you ever to get the crime of &s;pilling &s;o much blood repented of?</P>
<P>IT is a known cu&s;tom among the Fac|tors who re&s;ide in <HI>Africa,</HI> and the Ship-ma&s;ters who trade there, to corrupt many Negroes on the &s;ea coa&s;t, who &s;top at no act of cruelty for gain. They
<PB N="23" REF="012572_0021_0F8B1488AEC7AD70">
make it a practice, to &s;teal abundance of little Blacks of both &s;exes, when found on the roads, or in the fields, where their Parents keep them all day to watch the corn, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Can it be denied that the <HI>Africans</HI> are <HI>&s;tolen</HI> after &s;o many proofs of it, and if it is not direct &s;tealth in the Ship-ma&s;ters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> yet it is the &s;ame in effect; for if they did not go there and en|tice the Chiefs with money or goods, there would be no wars, as is the ca&s;e at pre&s;ent; and there would be none &s;tolen if the &s;tealers were not bribed by the Fac|tors or Ship-ma&s;ters; and not only tho&s;e that are made Slaves of, there would &s;till be ten thou&s;and others who are killed in the broils, that would be &s;aved, were they to di&s;continue this ba&s;e Trade.</P>
<P>THUS far I have &s;hewn that they are &s;tolen. They may &s;ay they pay for them. I an&s;wer, they give money or goods by way of price to &s;ome of the Princes and Negroes, who, for the &s;ake of lucre, take them pri&s;oners by war or &s;tealth, &s;o that what money they give the&s;e &s;coun|drels, (forgive me the expre&s;&s;ion; for, what name can a man expect who would take his Father or Brother and &s;ell them for gain?) who take them in the&s;e ways
<PB N="24" REF="012572_0022_0F8B148975329B48">
cannot be looked upon as a price paid in lieu, for the Negroes them&s;elves never conde&s;cend to be mancipated, as they get none of the money that is pretend|edly given for them. They at length arrive at the port, the Ship-ma&s;ter &s;ell them at a mo&s;t exorbitant profit, and in a few voyages he makes what he calls his fortune; this is all he aimed at and wi&s;hed for; and what follows, &s;ecures his eternal de&s;truction, unle&s;s timely re|pented of: For the truth of this, I could mention very &s;triking in&s;tances of men, who I &s;ee almo&s;t every day; but do not chu&s;e mentioning names, for fear of &s;eeing them contemned and de&s;pi&s;ed by every well thinking per&s;on.</P>
<P>I NEED add no more on this branch, it being clear that they are &s;tolen in every &s;en&s;e it can be taken; they, the Ship-ma&s;ters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> being the &s;ole cau&s;e of the many wars and broils that are among&s;t the Negro Princes and Chiefs, con&s;e|quently the cau&s;e of the&s;e poor creatures being taken and made Slaves of, and of the many thou&s;ands that are killed in the wars: Be&s;ides, it is not, nor can be denied, that they &s;ell them, &s;o that they who practi&s;e this branch of Man-&s;teal|ing

and &s;elling can expect nothing but the penalties of GOD's laws, which he, in his own time, will inflict, &s;ince man! indolent man! will not puni&s;h them with death, as warranted &s;ufficiently by the above cited pa&s;&s;age in holy writ.</P>
<P>BEFORE I leave this branch it may not he improper to give my Readers a &s;hort &s;ketch of the barbarous u&s;age the&s;e unhappy people meet with from the Ship-ma&s;ters in their pa&s;&s;age from <HI>Af|rica.</HI> After they have got them on board &s;hackled two and two together, they keep them confined below all the pa&s;&s;age, ne|ver permitting more than two on deck at a time to take one breath of fre&s;h air, the mo&s;t common ble&s;&s;ing we enjoy, con&s;cious that they are doing wrong to the&s;e people, and not certain but GOD might rai&s;e them again&s;t the Ship-ma&s;ter and his crew, if they had the lea&s;t op|portunity to &s;tir up an in&s;urrection in the &s;hip, to retrieve their Liberty which they had in their own country, and which then ought to enjoy by the laws of GOD, of <HI>Britain,</HI> and the Plantations.</P>
<P>FOR the Reader's true &s;atisfaction as to this inhuman and unchri&s;tian u&s;age, which could be expected of no other

<Q>Of one <HI>Harding,</HI> Ma&s;|ter of a ve&s;&s;el, in which &s;everal of the Men-&s;laves and a Woman-&s;lave had attempted to ri&s;e in order to recover their Liberty; &s;ome of whom the Ma&s;ter of his own authority &s;entenced to cruel deaths, making them fir&s;t eat the hearts and liver of one of tho&s;e he killed. The woman he hoi&s;ted by the thumbs, whiped, and &s;la&s;hed with knives before other Slaves, until &s;he died.</Q>
Oh unparralelled cruelty!</P>
<P>NEXT is an account given by a Ship-ma&s;ter who brought a Cargo of Slaves to <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> upon an enquiry what had been the &s;ucce&s;s of the voyage, he an|&s;wered,
<Q>That he had found it a difficult matter to &s;et the Negroes a fighting with each other in order to procure the number he wanted.</Q>
This &s;hews, Reader, what methods they practi&s;e to obtain the&s;e Slaves, <HI>by &s;etting them a fight|ing with each other.</HI>
<Q>But when he had
<PB N="27" REF="012572_0025_0F8B148BAB3ECD00">
obtained his end, having filled his ve&s;&s;el with Slaves, a new difficulty aro&s;e from their refu&s;al to take food: Tho&s;e de&s;perate creatures chu&s;ing rather to die with hunger than to be carried from their native country.</Q>
Upon a further enquiry how he got them to forego this de&s;perate re&s;olution, he an&s;wered,
<Q>That he obliged all the Negroes to come on deck, where they per&s;i&s;ting in their re&s;olution of not taking food, he cau|&s;ed his &s;ailors to lay hold on one of the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate, who chopped the poor creature into &s;mall pieces, forcing &s;ome of the others to eat a part of the man|gled body; &s;wearing to the &s;urvivors, that he would u&s;e them all one after the other in the &s;ame manner if they did not con&s;ent to eat.</Q>
This horrid execution he applauded as a good act, it having had the de&s;ired effect in cau|&s;ing them to take food.</P>
<P>"AS dete&s;table and &s;hocking as the&s;e u&s;ages to the poor Negroes may appear to &s;uch who&s;e hearts are not yet hardened by the practi&s;e of that cruelty which the love of wealth by degrees introduceth in|to the human mind, it will not be &s;trange to tho&s;e who have been concerned or em|ployed in the Trade."</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="012572_0026_0F8B148C6C825D08">THE &s;econd branch was, <HI>If he be found in his hands, he &s;urely &s;hall be put to death.</HI> This is the third and fourth clau&s;e of the before cited ver&s;e in <HI>Exod. If he be found in his hands.</HI> This is to be under&s;tood in two &s;en&s;es, either found in the Ship-ma&s;ter's hands who &s;tole him, or bought, as he &s;ay, or in the per|&s;on's hands who purcha&s;es him. As to the fir&s;t of the&s;e &s;en&s;es in which this pa&s;&s;age may be taken, if the laws of GOD, yea, even of man, were to be put into execution, he, the &s;tealer, or even the buyer, would be puni&s;hed with death, for it is clear as to Man-&s;tealing, that it de&s;erves death, by the above pa&s;&s;age of Scripture, and it is no le&s;s with regard to buying: But why do I &s;ay buying? For no money can be equal to the worth of a man: Buying, I admit that word becau&s;e Ship-ma&s;ters and others in this Trade, &s;ay, for their ju&s;tification that they purcha&s;ed the Negroes, but as there are no laws, either of GOD or man, for the buying and &s;tealing of <HI>Africans,</HI> I am inclined to think it cannot be &s;uppo|&s;ed, but they ju&s;tly de&s;erve death. And in the &s;econd &s;en&s;e, the man who buys the <HI>Africans</HI> or Negroes is full as culpable as the &s;tealer, and liable to the &s;ame
<PB N="29" REF="012572_0027_0F8B148D749015D0">
puni&s;hment, for Scripture does not point out particularly either of them, but only ju&s;t, <HI>If he be found in his hands,</HI> that is, in any man's hands, &s;o that it can be proved he &s;tole or bought him, <HI>he &s;urely &s;hall be put to death.</HI></P>
<P>THE third part was, <HI>He that buyeth a Servant and &s;erveth him &s;ix years, &s;hall &s;et him free the &s;eventh, and furni&s;h him libe|rally with what he hath.</HI> The fir&s;t part of this branch is proved in three different texts, <HI>viz. Exod.</HI> xxi. 2. <HI>Deut.</HI> xv. 12. and <HI>Jer.</HI> xxxiv. 14. In all which parts it is expre&s;&s;ly mentioned, <HI>That if an</HI> He|brew <HI>Servant be &s;old unto thee,</HI> or if you buy him he <HI>&s;hall &s;erve thee &s;ix years, and the &s;eventh, thou &s;hall let him go free from thee,</HI> that is, he &s;hall pay nothing for his Liberty.</P>
<P>SOME per&s;ons for argument &s;ake may object to this, &s;aying, the&s;e people are not <HI>Hebrews,</HI> as mentioned in the&s;e texts of Scripture, but <HI>Heathens.</HI> This may be difficult enough to determine. How|ever, admit they are <HI>Heathens,</HI> (although it is well known they are not) it mu&s;t be owned by tho&s;e who know them, that the natives of <HI>Africa</HI> have exalted notions of a Deity. It is an odd method the&s;e
<PB N="30" REF="012572_0028_0F8B148DE97D27A0">
Traders take to civilize and teach them the Chri&s;tian religion, by importing one hundred thou&s;and of them yearly into <HI>Virginia</HI> and other Southern Provinces, to|gether with the <HI>We&s;t-Indi</HI> i&s;lands, where they are kept in greater darkne&s;s than before, as they are not allowed to wor|&s;hip GOD on the Sabbath; but are em|ployed in worldly bu&s;ine&s;s on that day, which is a &s;candal to the Rulers of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Colonies and I&s;lands where &s;uch things are practi&s;ed. It is &s;ubver&s;ive of the Chri&s;tian religion not to allow tho&s;e ignorant people the benefit of it, who make up more than two thirds of the inhabitants of the before mentioned pla|ces. It is expre&s;&s;ly again&s;t the laws of GOD; for he gave <HI>Paul</HI> and other Apo&s;tles commi&s;&s;ion to go and preach the go&s;pel to every nation, kindred, and tongue; but in&s;tead of that, where the go&s;pel is preached throughout the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Colonies, and where the&s;e people might expect to receive the light of it; I &s;ay, in&s;tead of that, they are kept from divine wor&s;hip on Sundays, and never once in their lifetime admitted to church, but obliged to cultivate their &s;mall piece of ground allowed them by their Ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>THE la&s;t part of the ver&s;e runs thus,

<HI>And &s;hall furni&s;h him liberally with what he hath.</HI> That is, when the Servant hath &s;erved thee &s;ix years, as expre&s;&s;ed in <HI>Exod.</HI> xxi. 2, and <HI>Deut.</HI> xv. 12. <HI>Then in the &s;eventh year you &s;hall let him go free from you;</HI> and in ver. 13. <HI>Thou &s;hall not let him go away empty.</HI> Ver. 14. <HI>Thou &s;hall furni&s;h him liberally out of thy flock, and out of thy floor, and out of thy wine pre&s;s; of that wherewith the</HI> LORD <HI>thy</HI> GOD <HI>hath ble&s;&s;ed thee, thou &s;halt, give him.

chap. After enjoining that it may not &s;eem hard unto you in &s;ending away this Servant, as he hath been worth a double hired one, in &s;erving thee &s;ix years, he &s;ays, <HI>and the</HI> LORD <HI>thy</HI> GOD <HI>&s;hall ble&s;s thee in all that thou doe&s;t.</HI> Sweet encou|ragement for poor &s;inful &s;ouls!

This charming pro|mi&s;e of a ble&s;&s;ing in all that thou doe&s;t, and the dreadful events that may take place in contradicting the command of GOD, I hope will make &s;uch impre&s;&s;ions upon the minds of men, that they will not bind Servant to &s;erve above &s;ix years; but will &s;et him at liberty in the &s;eventh year, and give him liberally of what the LORD hath ble&s;&s;ed them with, as requir|ed in the above cited text.

<P>THE fourth and la&s;t &s;ection on this head, <HI>If thy Brother be &s;old unto thee, thou &s;hall not compel him to &s;erve as a Bond-man; but as an hired Servant.</HI> This is proved by <HI>Lev.</HI> xxv. 39, 40. where it is &s;aid, <HI>If thy

Brother that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor, and be &s;old unto thee, thou &s;halt not compel him to &s;erve as a Bond-&s;ervant.</HI> This is expre&s;&s;ly again&s;t making Slaves of any of our poor Brethren, or compeling them to &s;erve as Bond-&s;ervants. <HI>If thy Bro|ther that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor,</HI> are the words of the ver&s;e; the poor <HI>Afri|cans</HI> who fall into the hands of the Men|wolves that prowl on their coa&s;ts, are obli|ged to &s;erve their lifetime, and their chil|dren after them: This is being Bond-men with a witne&s;s, and as we have great rea|&s;on to believe they are poor enough when they &s;teal them, they are kept &s;o forever after, not having means to make a penny them&s;elves. The <HI>Africans</HI> will be under&s;tood, if not primarily intended, to be the people mentioned in this text! It is &s;aid, <HI>Thy Brother who dwelleth by thee:</HI> When they are in <HI>Afri|ca</HI> it is certain they are at a great di&s;tance; but when they come to <HI>America</HI> or the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> they then dwell <HI>by us;</HI> therefore I think, from the above citations, no per&s;on can buy the&s;e people, and oblige them and their children to &s;erve as Slaves, without incur|ing the di&s;plea&s;ure of GOD and his pu|ni&s;hments for di&s;obeying his ju&s;t commands.</P>
<P>IT may be added, as in v. 42d of the &s;ame chap. <HI>For they are my &s;ervants, which I brought
<PB N="34" REF="012572_0032_0F8B1493822DF008">
forth out of</HI> Eygpt; <HI>they &s;hall not be &s;old as Bond-men.</HI> The la&s;t part of this ver&s;e is ex|pre&s;&s;ly again&s;t <HI>&s;elling</HI> them as Bond-men. Should it be objected, that the <HI>Africans</HI> were not <HI>brought forth out of the land of</HI> Egypt, it would not affect the controver&s;y. I would &s;incerely advi&s;e every man who is in this abominable Trade not to per&s;i&s;t in it, &s;eeing the many threats and commands again&s;t him in GOD's laws, and the ble&s;|&s;ings that are promi&s;ed if he does not.</P>
<P>THE IId General Head propo&s;ed, is, That this practi&s;e of making Slaves of our Brethren is likewi&s;e again&s;t the law of nature, and the Charter of this Province. The fir&s;t part of this head, may be ea|&s;ily proved by the following texts of Scrip|ture; <HI>Matt.</HI> vii. 12. <HI>Therefore all things what&s;oever ye would that men &s;hould do to you, do ye even &s;o to them. Luke</HI> vi. 31. <HI>And as you would that men &s;hould do to you, do ye &s;o to them likewi&s;e.</HI> Who is that proud one that will not receive the&s;e in&s;tructions? And who is that man that will do unto any per&s;on, either white or black, Chri&s;tian or Savage, contrary to what he would that he &s;hould do to him? This would be acting contrary to rea&s;on and common &s;en&s;e. Would any per&s;on con&s;ent to have him&s;elf torn from his friends and native country, and be
<PB N="35" REF="012572_0033_0F8B1493F0BAAF88">
made a Slave for life, and to have his dear, dear little children continue in the &s;ame condition from one generation to another? No; &s;urely no per&s;on would agree to that. Well then, it certainly mu&s;t be contrary to the laws of nature, chri&s;tianity, and &s;ub|ver&s;ive of the texts ju&s;t quoted, which were wrote for our direction and guidance in this world. It is likewi&s;e certain, that tho&s;e who carry on this Trade, do not unto men as they would men &s;hould do to them; for if the&s;e poor people which they, the Ship-ma&s;ters take from their own Coun|try and then &s;ell for Slaves, were doing to them as they are done to, they would (were it in their power, which &s;eldom is the ca&s;e, the owners being con&s;cious of the wrong they are doing, and dreading what naturally would follow) revenge the injury they re|ceive in being made Slaves, and re&s;ume that Liberty again, which was wrongful-taken from them; I &s;ay, they would often revenge the injury offered them by killing the Captain of the &s;hip who had taken them to be mancipated for life, and would &s;erve in the &s;ame manner the Owners of the ve&s;&s;el if they could get them, who are no better than the Ma&s;ters, in putting them into &s;uch employ. Who could find fault with them? No per&s;on, They were only

retrieving the mo&s;t common ble&s;&s;ing we enjoy, Liberty, and in&s;tead of being puni&s;hed, the law would protect them in &s;o noble an action. But,</P>
<P>READERS, before I leave this, let me beg you to "bring the matter home to your|&s;elves, and think whether any condition in life can be more completely mi&s;erable than that of tho&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Captives. On reflecting, that each of them had &s;ome ten|der attachments which were broke by the cruel &s;eparation! Some Parent or Wife who had not an opportunity of mingling tears in a parting embrace! Perhaps &s;ome In|fant or aged Parent whom his labour was to feed, and vigilance protect! and him|&s;elf under the dreadful apprehen&s;ions of perpetual Slavery."</P>
<P>TO inforce this part of the head, allow me, Reader, to intrude a little upon your time, by giving you a &s;hort account of the barbarous u&s;age the&s;e poor Negroes meet with from their Ma&s;ters in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> and Southern Provinces of <HI>North-America;</HI> on reading of which, you will not he long in concluding, that they do not in this ca&s;e ob&s;erve the golden rule.</P>
<P>THE crimes attending the Slave Trade are

greatly aggravated by the extreme cruel u&s;age the Negroes meet with in the Plan|tations, as well with regard to food and cloa|thing as the hard and unrea&s;onable labour that is exacted from them, and what cannot be forgot, the &s;evere cha&s;ti&s;ements they frequently &s;uffer, which is bounded by the wrath and plea&s;ure of their hard ta&s;k-ma&s;ters. 1&s;t.

<Q>The ta&s;k-ma&s;ters, by their inhuman u&s;age and unrelenting &s;courges have ploughed their backs and made long furrows, and at length brought them even to death.</Q>
This is the fate which great numbers in the i&s;lands and Southern Provinces meet with. When &s;peak|ing of their cloathing and food, he adds,
<Q>When pa&s;&s;ing along, I have viewed your plantations cleared and cultivated, many &s;pacious hou&s;es built, and the Owners of them faring &s;umptuou&s;ly every day. My blood has frequently run cold with|in me to con&s;ider how many of your Slaves had neither convenient food to eat or proper raiment to put on, notwith&s;tand|ing many of the comforts you enjoy were &s;olely owing to their indefatigable la|bours.</Q>

What more could be done to a brute bea&s;t, who was brought up and de&s;igned for the yoke? Oh! how long will you continue in this delu&s;ion and horrid abu&s;e of the prin|cipal workman&s;hip of GOD.

a few ob&s;ervations which Mr. <HI>Po&s;|tlethwayt</HI> makes upon the great qualities which this country abound with. "Its &s;ituation for commerce is certainly be|yond any of the other quarters of the world, for it &s;tands in the center be|tween the other three, and has thereby a much nearer communication with <HI>Europe, A&s;ia,</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> than any other quarter has with the re&s;t. It is wonderfully accom|modated for commerce by the interpo&s;i|on of i&s;lands, and more particularly by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the trade winds, which render the navigation &s;afe, ea&s;y, and con&s;tant. It is furni&s;hed with the greate&s;t and mo&s;t convenient navigable rivers, and perhaps with as many of them as any other of the chief parts of the world: Such are the <HI>Nile, Nubia, Niger, Natal,</HI> which are ri|vers of the fir&s;t magnitude; be&s;ides the&s;e there are innumerable others, though not equal to the former, are yet very excellent &s;treams, &s;ituated for navigation and com|merce, and which by their noble cour&s;es penetrate far inland; if the <HI>Europeans, &amp;c.</HI> would cultivate a human and Chri&s;|tian like commerce with the <HI>Africans,</HI> they might through the&s;e rivers become the medium of an endle&s;s beneficial commerce. The country is populous beyond credibi|lity,

the &s;oil fruitful, the &s;ea&s;on for the greate&s;t part mild and clement, and the air &s;alubrious." I mu&s;t &s;top in the mid&s;t of this agreeable de&s;cription, being afraid of leading my&s;elf into an undue length in this narrative of the beautious perfection of that rich and fruitful part of the world.</P>
<P>I SHALL now con&s;ider the di&s;advantages to <HI>Africa</HI> in taking &s;o many of its natives away yearly. But it needle&s;s to &s;peak much on this head, as mo&s;t of my Readers will perceive the prejudices to <HI>Africa</HI> in thus drain|ing it of the inhabitants yearly in the man|ner <HI>Britain</HI> and the Plantations do. I &s;hall mention a few of them. 1&s;t. There can be no lo&s;s to any country (particularly to one like <HI>Africa</HI> that is yet mo&s;tly to cultivate) equal to that of depopulating it. 2d. It prevents the inland country, where the in|ce&s;&s;ant broils are carried on, from defend|ing them&s;elves again&s;t the attacks and en|croachments made on their properties by the Kings and Chiefs, whereby many thou|&s;ands of their &s;ubjects being taken pri&s;on|ers, are &s;old to the Coa&s;ters, they being nouri&s;hed and care&s;&s;ed by the <HI>Europeans,</HI> particularly by <HI>Britain</HI> and the Colonies, in doing &s;o, for the &s;ake of the Slave Trade to <HI>America,</HI> and the <HI>We&s;t-Indies;</HI> and further, in con&s;equence of this depriving
<PB N="47" REF="012572_0045_0F8B149F332070A0">
them of defending them&s;elves again&s;t the&s;e ba&s;e a&s;&s;aults, it prevents them entirely from cultivating and manuring that fruitful and rich country, to the degree it is capable of. 3d. It ever ob&s;tructs the civilizing of tho&s;e people, and con&s;equently of propaga|ting among&s;t them the Chri&s;tian religion, and extending the Trade into the bowels of <HI>Africa,</HI> which by contrary means might be ea&s;ily practicable. 4th. That whil&s;t the &s;laving Trade of tho&s;e people, continue to be the great object of the powers that trade there it is to be feared it will ever, as it does at pre&s;ent &s;pirit up wars and ho&s;ti|lities among&s;t the Negro Princes and Chiefs, for the &s;ake of making captives of each other for &s;ale. And 5th. The greate&s;t di&s;|advantage to <HI>Africa,</HI> by thus draining it of the inhabitants is, that it prevents them from cultivating and peopling that great fertile country, of introducing <HI>European</HI> arts and &s;ciences among&s;t them, and of car|rying on a friendly, civil, and chri&s;tian Com|merce with them into the heart of their region.</P>
<P>The &s;econd branch alluding to the third head was, to treat of the prejudice to <HI>Africa,</HI> and its trade with <HI>Europe.</HI> It is an ab&s;olute fact, that the&s;e people are ince&s;&s;ently at war with their neighbouring
<PB N="48" REF="012572_0046_0F8B149FEBFB3F30">
Princes &s;o that they cannot get their bu&s;i|ne&s;s looked into or followed, and con&s;e|quently a great hinderance to the manu|facturing &s;uch quantities of their country's produce of every kind, to &s;end to <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>America, &amp;c.</HI> as they might do, were this Slave Trade aboli&s;hed, and the Rulers in amity, friend&s;hip, and concord, one with another.</P>
<P>It is further a hurt to the <HI>African</HI> trade with <HI>Europe,</HI> for the Slave Trade has &s;o gained upon the minds of tho&s;e men that traffick to <HI>Africa,</HI> that they never once think of the other commodities, at lea&s;t in &s;uch quantities as <HI>Europe</HI> might con&s;ume were the attention nece&s;&s;ary paid to it by making this the only object of the tra|ders notice, I believe it would turn out much more profitable to keep wholly to the produce of this country, <HI>viz.</HI> gums, ivory, gold and &s;ilver du&s;t, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and to re&s;ign that ba&s;e unchri&s;tian Trade of Man-&s;elling.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, on this head, To &s;hew the di&s;ad|vantages to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Plantations in <HI>Ame|rica, &amp;c.</HI> in bringing Black people into them. This will be made very ea&s;ily ap|pear when you con&s;ider, that the&s;e nume|rous Black People, which are yearly brought
<PB N="49" REF="012572_0047_0F8B14A0AF3A2A08">
into the &s;outhern-mo&s;t parts of <HI>North-Ame|rica</HI> and the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> were very poor at that time, not having a penny to command, and never &s;o much as once in their lifetime had it in their power to make one half that &s;um for them&s;elves, &s;o that the different Provinces in the Continent, and the I&s;lands in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> are filled with the&s;e nece&s;|&s;itous Black People, and mu&s;t be put upon the town&s;hips to which they belong, in ca&s;e this en&s;laving them be ever aboli&s;hed, which I flatter my&s;elf, and I hope not vainly, will be done in time, and that with effect. Further, why do they fill their Plantations with Black People, &s;o unnatural to the Whites, the Proprietors of the different Colonies, when it &s;eems no way difficult to obtain White People to &s;erve free in their &s;tead? <HI>Europe</HI> in general affords numbers of poor and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed objects for that pur|po&s;e, find if the&s;e were not overworked, as the Negroes generally are, they would make as good Servants for the <HI>Ame|rican</HI> and <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> Plantations as the Blacks do. And if the <HI>Europeans</HI> were up|on a level with regard to the price of labour, in their Colonies, I cannot but think they would reap great advantage in laying a&s;ide the Slave Trade, and cultivate a friendly and civilized Commerce with the <HI>Africans.</HI>
<PB N="50" REF="012572_0048_0F8B14A1EDF34E40">
Until this is done it does not &s;eem po&s;&s;ible that the inland trade of that country &s;hould ever be extended to the degree it is capable of; for while the &s;pirit of <HI>Butchery</HI> and making Slaves of each other, is promoted by the <HI>Europeans, Americans, &amp;c.</HI> among&s;t tho&s;e people, they will never be able to travel with &s;afety into the heart of the coun|try, or to cement &s;uch commercial friend|&s;hip and alliance with them, as will actually introduce our arts and manufactures.</P>
<P>THE IVth General Head was, To &s;hew the advantages ari&s;ing from aboli&s;hing this ba&s;e cu&s;tom. This Head I propo&s;e divi|ding into two parts, 1&s;t. The advantages to <HI>Africa,</HI> and 2d. The advantages to <HI>Europe</HI> particularly to <HI>Britain</HI> and the Plan|tations in <HI>America</HI> and the <HI>We&s;t-Indies.</HI></P>
<P>FIRST to <HI>Africa.</HI> The advantages that would ari&s;e to it, in aboli&s;hing this ba&s;e and unchri&s;tian-like Commerce are nume|rous, &s;ome of which may be compre|hended under the following. 1&s;t. The aboli&s;hing this Trade may be a means of peopling this country, and of cultivating it in the &s;ame manner with any other coun|try in <HI>Europe</HI> or <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> &s;o as to render it capa|ble of bearing in as great abundance as the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> &s;pices of equal quality to tho&s;e
<PB N="51" REF="012572_0049_0F8B14A24B8E7730">
of <HI>Banda, Ternate,</HI> and <HI>Amboyna;</HI> I &s;ay, the like &s;pices might be produced on the rich and fruitful &s;hores of <HI>Melinda</HI> on the ea&s;t &s;ide, or of the &s;lave coa&s;t on the we&s;t &s;ide of <HI>Africa,</HI> and that as ea&s;y and to as great advantage, as where they are now rai&s;ed, the latitude being the &s;ame, and &s;oil not unlike; and, in &s;hort, cinnamon and all others, the production of <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and <HI>We&s;t-In|dies,</HI> by proper management might be rai&s;ed here as well as in tho&s;e parts. 2d. It would introduce the Chri&s;tian religion among them, which is a &s;hame to the&s;e nations who pretend to hold fa&s;t the principles of Chri&s;tianity, to keep &s;o long hid, and of con&s;equence, be a means of bringing among them the more civilized arts and &s;ciences. 3d. It will recommend the <HI>Eu|ropean</HI> dre&s;s, and introduce their cu&s;toms among the natives, and of cour&s;e civilize them like other Chri&s;tian nations. La&s;tly. It will be a means of bringing this country to as great perfection in trade, riches, and grandeur, as any in <HI>Europe,</HI> it being a much more fertile and plentious &s;oil for many valuable productions.</P>
<P>MUCH more could I &s;ay upon the nu|merous advantages ari&s;ing to this excel|lent country: But let what has been &s;aid &s;uffice, I leave the re&s;t to the Reader's own
<PB N="52" REF="012572_0050_0F8B14A469845F48">
feeling, if he has any for this poor di&s;tre&s;|&s;ed <HI>Africa</HI> which groans under a heavy load of oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE next thing in cour&s;e is, the advan|tages that would ari&s;e to <HI>Europe</HI> in thus carrying on a Chri&s;tian-like Commerce with <HI>Africa.</HI> This trade even in its pre&s;ent &s;tate, excluding that of the Slaves, is as advan|tageous as any that is now followed; and what will it be when a friendly traf|fick is carried on? It is as it were all profit, the fir&s;t co&s;t being &s;ome things of <HI>European,</HI> particularly of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> manufac|tures, and others generally purcha&s;ed with them; for which there is in return, gold, elephant's-teeth, wax, gums, cotton-wool, divers dying-woods, and Slaves: But this la&s;t piece of Commerce, <HI>viz.</HI> Man-&s;laving, I am far from making a part of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> trade, and I dare &s;ay every humane per|&s;on will be likeminded. The&s;e are articles which the country abound in, and would be &s;till cheaper to an immen&s;e degree, were the inland parts &s;ettled with their own peo|ple; but in&s;tead of that, a hundred thou|&s;and are yearly carried away. <HI>Britain</HI> pays but little for the commodities it exports to <HI>Africa,</HI> being mo&s;tly, as ob&s;erved before, its own produce, &s;uch as wor&s;ted and con|ton cloths of all kinds, bra&s;s, iron, and cop|per
<PB N="53" REF="012572_0051_0F8B14A528A5D2A0">
work of every &s;ort, particularly large quantities of all kinds of defen&s;ive arms, with powder and &s;hot in proportion; <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> goods, every kind of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> manufac|tures, and a good deal of <HI>American</HI> and <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> rum, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It is not ea&s;y to &s;ay what va&s;t quantities of the above <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> and <HI>American</HI> productions would be ex|hau&s;ted yearly among &s;o great a people, and in &s;o very exten&s;ive a country, were the Slave Trade &s;topped. It is the intere&s;t of every Merchant in <HI>Britain</HI> and the Plantations who are now concerned in traffick to <HI>Africa,</HI> to cultivate the inland commerce in its utmo&s;t extent, as having no manner of con|cern with the Slave Trade, there being the greate&s;t rea&s;on to believe, that where they now export twenty &s;hillings worth of com|modities thither, they would then export an hundred pound; and I am inclined to think when the trade comes to be extend|ed to the degree it will admit of, notwith|&s;tanding tho&s;e goods that are imported from <HI>Africa,</HI> there will &s;till be di&s;covered an infi|nite variety of trafficable articles, with which the pre&s;ent Traders are totally unacquaint|ed, and this Trade become the mo&s;t benefi|cial to <HI>Britain, America,</HI> and the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> of any that is at pre&s;ent on foot, as it is common to every individual, and of

which the government has taken much notice, by granting an annual &s;um of ten thou&s;and pounds &s;terling for the main|taining and upholding the forts and ca&s;tles in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Settlements in <HI>Africa,</HI> &s;o that they are entirely defended again&s;t the at|tacks of any enemy, and their Trade and Colonies &s;ecured by irre&s;i&s;tible &s;trength of forts and ca&s;tles.</P>
<P>A GREAT deal more could be mentioned on the thou&s;ands of advantages that may ari&s;e to the intere&s;t of <HI>Britain</HI> and the Plan|tations in aboli&s;hing this wicked Trade: However, I &s;hall detain my Readers no longer on this head, but as propo&s;ed,</P>
<P>CONCLUDE the whole with &s;ome &s;hort admonitions to tho&s;e concerned, and a me|thod to put this Trade to <HI>Africa</HI> upon a ju&s;t and lawful footing.

What arguments or rea&s;on, pray, can be advanced for his ju&s;tification, when he &s;ees &s;uch threats and cur&s;es again&s;t him, particularly mentioned in the fir&s;t head?

<P>I WOULD add one nece&s;&s;ary query more, to tho&s;e who hold the &s;word of ju&s;tice, and who mu&s;t account to GOD for the u&s;e they make of it. Since the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Law is &s;o truly valuable for its ju&s;tice, how can they overlook the barbarous deaths and wrong|ful Slavery of the unhappy <HI>Africans,</HI> with|out trial or proof of being guilty of crimes adequate to their puni&s;hments? Why are tho&s;e Ma&s;ters of ve&s;&s;els (who are not the mo&s;t con&s;iderate of men) &s;uf|fered to be &s;overeign arbiters of the lives of the&s;e mi&s;erable Negroes in their pa&s;&s;age, and allowed with impunity to de&s;troy, may I not &s;ay murder their fellow crea|tures in a manner &s;o cruel as can never be related but with &s;hame and horror? An&s;wer me this, ye pretended Judges and Governors in the different Colonies where &s;uch prac|tices are u&s;ed, and not be &s;hocked at the negligence you have &s;leeped in. Since you are put in remembrance of it now, I hope and &s;incerely with, I, or any other per&s;on may not have occa&s;ion to remind you of the &s;ame again, but that you will puni&s;h with

equity all tho&s;e who import Negroes; there being hundreds of poor <HI>Europeans</HI> that would be glad to come and &s;erve in any of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Plantations, and tho&s;e that could not pay a pa&s;&s;age doubtle&s;s would &s;ell part of their time for it; and this I make no doubt, con&s;idering they have not the charge of their funeral and death-bed ex|pences and &s;undry other things to pay, will come nigh if not full as cheap as buying and keeping Negroes; and it will be attended with this advantage, that the&s;e White people when they have &s;erved &s;ome years in the lowe&s;t capacities turn out up|on the wa&s;te land, marry, and in a few years we &s;ee a town well &s;ettled, and in le&s;s than fifty years there will be an increa&s;e of fourfold; by this means the country will fill up and we become re&s;pectable and &s;e|cure from an enemy, and furni&s;hed with every conveniency of life.

management. Now give me leave to pro|ceed</P>
<P>IN a method to put this Trade to <HI>Af|rica</HI> on a ju&s;t and lawful footing. Fir&s;t, in order to this, it is my humble opinion, if I may be allowed to give it, that there be a number of men who may chu&s;e to venture in this Trade, both in <HI>Britain</HI> and the Colo|nies, that &s;hall be incorporated into &s;eparate bodies by the name of <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> or <HI>Briti&s;h; American,</HI> or <HI>New England African</HI> companies, or by the denomination of other Provinces in <HI>America,</HI> or Plantations in the <HI>We&s;t-In|dies;</HI> and the&s;e companies &s;hall equip and rig out as many ve&s;&s;els as they think pro|per, loading them with <HI>Briti&s;h America, Ea&s;t</HI> and <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> goods, and bring back in return, the rich and plentiful produce of <HI>Af|rica.</HI> But before I go any further into this point it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, there is one real hinderance in the way which mu&s;t be re|moved, or el&s;e no man or company need ever think of penetrating into the heart of this country, but ju&s;t content them|&s;elves with taking the &s;kim of this Trade, leting the body &s;tand, and that is, the Slave Trade; this mu&s;t be entirely renoun|ced and given up by the <HI>Europeans,</HI> par|ticularly by <HI>Britain</HI> and the Colonies;
<PB N="64" REF="012572_0062_0F8B14B08A7231C0">
then we may with a good face and con&s;ci|ence travel into the heart of <HI>Africa,</HI> and meet with a friendly and hearty re|ception from the natives, who will trade with us, and give in exchange their valua|ble productions for our goods which are generally exported thither.</P>
<P>WHEN that great, that only chief ob&s;ta|cle, the Slave Trade is removed, then <HI>Bri|tain</HI> and the Colonies will flouri&s;h by &s;o great and profitable a Commerce. Think what a great addition it will make to their traffick, the furni&s;hing a hundred thou&s;and people annually, more than are at pre&s;ent with cloathing, powder, &s;hot, and warlike arms, and many more things needle&s;s here to enumerate out of England; rum, and &s;undry other articles out of <HI>America</HI> and the <HI>We&s;t-Indies.</HI> It is &s;uppo&s;ed that the above ex|traordinary number of Blacks are taken out of <HI>Africa</HI> yearly, and either murdered or made Slaves of, by the &s;hips that go there out of <HI>Bo&s;ton, &amp;c.</HI> and what advantages may ari&s;e to the inhabitants in peopling, and con|&s;equently of cultivating and manuring their ground, and of bringing their rich trade to the perfection it is capable of, with <HI>Britain, &amp;c.</HI> is hard to &s;ay, when the innermo&s;t parts of that great and fruitful country is &s;ettled,
<PB N="65" REF="012572_0063_0F8B14B139F73FA8">
and a free and happy trade carried into the heart of it: But thus far I will venture to &s;ay, as I have done already, that where twenty &s;hillings worth of commodities is at pre&s;ent exported an hundred pound will be, when a friendly Commerce is carried on with the natives.</P>
<P>THESE companies may &s;ay, that if once this trade is &s;et on foot, other <HI>European</HI> pow|ers, who have Settlements in <HI>Africa</HI> will invade them whenever they begin to thrive by not having &s;ufficient funds for the keep|ing in good defence the forts, &amp;c. on the Settlements. As to this I an&s;wer, that tho&s;e companies have a &s;um of ten thou|&s;and pounds &s;terling annually, from the Crown of <HI>Britain,</HI> for maintaining and up|holding the forts and ca&s;tles that are built upon the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Colonies, which with the duties ari&s;ing from the Trade will be &s;ufficient to maintain, uphold, and defend them with &s;trength &s;uperior to the &s;trong|e&s;t enemy.</P>
<P>THUS far I hope I have removed your fears of inability in &s;upporting and conti|nuing this Trade, and likewi&s;e have mov|ed ways and means to put the &s;ame on a ju&s;t and lawful footing. Now let me,

patient Reader, conclude with a &s;hort Ex|hortation to the Ship-ma&s;ters and Mer|chants concerned in this Trade, in part of which I have had recour&s;e again to my good old Friend Mr. <HI>Benezet.</HI></P>
<P>I BEG you all would fly from the oppre&s;&s;ion and Bondage to which the poor <HI>Africans</HI> are &s;ubjected, loo&s;e the bonds from off their necks, and thereby extri|cate your&s;elves from a cu&s;tom which is per|nicious to your welfare here and hereafter; and as you are &s;en&s;ible mo&s;t men have ob|jections to this ba&s;e, unlawful Trade, you ought to vindicate your&s;elves to the world, upon principles of rea&s;on, hone&s;ty, and hu|manity, and then you will not attack the per&s;ons, or invade the rights of the&s;e people. I believe tho&s;e who are concerned in this Trade will be at a lo&s;s to make this ju&s;tifi|cation but upon motives &s;o weak and un|rea&s;onable, that I do not think any of them which have been advanced for their defence worthy of notice; and if they are un|de&s;erving of that, they certainly are below regard; therefore I think <HI>you &s;hould forever lay it a&s;ide.</HI> This is the be&s;t and &s;horte&s;t way; for <HI>there &s;hould be no trade carried on,</HI> it being a national and provincial con|cern, <HI>but &s;uch as is ju&s;tifiable both to</HI> GOD
<PB N="67" REF="012572_0065_0F8B14B2B0F98D48">
<HI>and man,</HI> and this is in direct oppo&s;ition to both. But laying man's re&s;entment a&s;ide, which is of little moment in compari|&s;on with that of the Almighty's, I coun&s;el you once more to think of a future reck|oning, con&s;ider what rea&s;ons you will be able to produce at the great and la&s;t day. You now accumulate riches and live in plea&s;ure; but what will you do in the end, and that will be but &s;hort? What if you &s;hould be called hence and hurried out of this world under the va&s;t load of blood guiltine&s;s that is now lying on your &s;ouls? How many thou&s;ands have you been the i&s;truments to, and primary cau&s;e of being killed in the wars and broils, with the <HI>African</HI> Chiefs, wanting to obtain your number to en&s;lave; and how many have you killed in the pa&s;&s;age, when the&s;e poor Creatures were trying to retrieve their Li|berty which they had in their own coun|try, and which you unju&s;tly take from them, or rather chu&s;ing to die than take food to nouri&s;h and pre&s;erve them&s;elves for being mancipated with their children after them?</P>

Can you think that GOD will hear your prayers, receive your &s;upplications, or grant your de&s;ires, while you act thus gro&s;&s;ly and openly again&s;t his divine revealed will and plea|&s;ure? And do you &s;uppo&s;e that he who is the Parent of all nations, the Protector of

<P>PERMIT your&s;elves for a moment to re|flect equitably and deliberately upon the nature of this horrid, dete&s;table, vile, and abominable Man Trade, and your hearts mu&s;t certainly relent, if you have not lo&s;t all &s;en&s;e of benevolence, all &s;ympathy and compa&s;&s;ion towards tho&s;e of your Brethren who have the &s;ame capacities, under&s;tand|ings and &s;ouls, and who were born to in|herit the &s;ame &s;alvation with you; I &s;ay, if you are not callous to every Chri&s;tian, hu|mane, and manly &s;en&s;ibility, you certainly mu&s;t feel compa&s;&s;ion for tho&s;e extremely oppre&s;&s;ed people, when you think what mi&s;eries, what deva&s;tations and ma&s;&s;acres among them you have been the author of, and all for filthy lucre's &s;ake.
