<SPEAKER>Loron,</SPEAKER>
<P>As your Excellency was mentioning, That GOD was pleas'd to grant you a &s;afe Arrival, it was very agreable to us, that GOD was pleas'd to pre|&s;erve your Lives when in Danger, and land you in Safety.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron;</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI> We are in good Health this Morning; and rejoice that your Excellency and the Gentlemen are all well al&s;o this Morning.</P>
<P>And as your Excellency de&s;ir'd Ye&s;terday that we may &s;peak freely, we de|clare we now de&s;ire to renew the Treaty made in the Year 1727.</P>
<P>Which Treaty your Excellency has by you; and is the &s;ame we now mean. This is really the fir&s;t Treaty, and tho&s;e that were at the Treaty then, and their Children and Grand Children are obliged to ob&s;erve it.</P>
<P>This is what we depend upon; and if any Thing &s;hould fall out contrary thereto, that Treaty is to be con&s;ulted, and both Sides to be judg'd by it.</P>
<P>The Treaty we have &s;afe by us here; and though we don't under&s;tand Writing, the Treaty will &s;peak for it &s;elf.</P>
<P>The Article of Trade is the chief and mo&s;t material Thing; therefore is fir&s;t to be con&s;idered. Some Time after the beginning of which Treaty, in 1726, the Trade was altered: And at the Conclu&s;ion of the Treaty afterwards, it was promis'd, That the Trade &s;hould be better regulated for the future: And it was further told us, if any Body &s;hould &s;ell cheaper than the Engli&s;h, this Govern|ment, would go beyond them, particularly the French, who were poorer than the Engli&s;h, and could not afford to &s;ell cheaper. That at the fir&s;t beginning of Trade a Stroud Blanket was <HI>Thirty Shillings</HI>: Corn was <HI>Seven Shillings</HI> per Bu&s;hel: Powder was <HI>Four Shillings</HI> per Pound: Shot at <HI>Ten Pence</HI> per Pound: And a &s;trip'd Blanket was <HI>Twenty Shillings.</HI> And for all other little Things, which can't at pre&s;ent be enumerated, they were &s;old for a le&s;s Price at that Time than at this.</P>
<P>What is now &s;aid is the Truth concerning the Trade; which we are very unea&s;y under, that all Things &s;hould grow dearer every Year.</P>
<P>And as your Excellency de&s;ired us to &s;peak the Truth, we &s;hall be very free and open, and &s;peak the whole Truth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="004976_0006_100E4F0F4098D500">
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>That is my de&s;ire that you &s;hould u&s;e the greate&s;t Freedom and Liberty; it being the End of our Meeting, that we &s;hould have a right Under|&s;tanding of each other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron,</SPEAKER>
<P>The rea&s;on of our mentioning the Affair of Trade, is becau&s;e that Matter is the chief Band of our Peace and Friend&s;hip, and therefore &s;hould be well &s;etled and concluded.</P>
<P>The Trade is not well furni&s;hed; and Things are not &s;uitable as formerly, which will &s;lacken Love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>If you can mention any other Particulars concerning the Trade which you have not &s;poken of, endeavour to recollect them, and enumerate them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron,</SPEAKER>
<P>At the Treaty in 1727, Governour DUMMER told us, he could &s;upply us much cheaper than the French, who us'd yearly to make us a Pre&s;ent of Powder and Shot, which the Engli&s;h could better a f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ord than they.</P>
<P>Which Pre&s;ent we never have had, though we are daily looking out for it.</P>
<P>And as to the Truck-Hou&s;e here, it is always wanting Provi&s;ions, Tobacco, and many other nece&s;&s;ary Things.</P>
<P>As for a Hundred Bu&s;hels of Corn, it is nothing; for it will not Supply a Bu&s;hel a Man when we come to Trade. Nay, Two Hundred Bu&s;hels is really nothing when we come to Trade, being &s;o very little and in&s;ufficient that we are forc'd to divide it.</P>
<P>We de&s;ire there may be &s;o much that every Man may have what he can pur|cha&s;e, which will then be enough.</P>
<P>And we de&s;ire that a Li&s;t of the Prizes of the Goods may be po&s;ted up here; and that Two Men may be cho&s;en with an Interpreter to view the Truck-Hou&s;es, Spring and Fall by the Government to &s;ee that nothing be wanting therein.</P>
<P>Another Grievance is, That it was &s;aid, none of your young Men, &s;hould go into our Woods to Hunt; but &s;hould continue by the Water-Side, which is not comply'd withal.</P>
<P>The Rea&s;on of our mentioning it is, If they kill our hunting Game, we have nothing el&s;e to live upon; whereas the Engli&s;h till the Ground, and have other Ways to &s;upport them&s;elves. This Practice if continued, will de&s;troy our Livelihood.</P>
<P>Now we come to another Head, and &s;peak for our Tribes in general, That <HI>Jabez Bradbury</HI> may be our Truck Ma&s;ter here at St. <HI>George</HI>'s.</P>
<P>The Rea&s;on thereof is; <HI>Jabez</HI> can under&s;tand us, and we him; and it is very difficult for one that don't under&s;tand the Language to Trade with us.</P>
<P>When we begun to trade, it us'd to be the Cu&s;tom to give Money for Peltry, but now we can't under&s;tand Cyphering; and they tell us, Your Peltry comes to &s;o much; by which as we don't under&s;tand it, we are cheated, being obliged to depend upon the Word of the Truck-Ma&s;ter for the Weight by which we often &s;uffer.</P>
<P>We have done concerning the Trade.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="004976_0007_100E4F10D05F5C48">
What we have now repeated was engag'd in Governour DUMMER's Treaty; and we de&s;ire tho&s;e Things may now be remembred and agreed to that we may Live in Love and Peace.</P>
<P>As I was the Chief in that Day, and was the Cau&s;e of our Tribes complying with that Treaty; they de&s;ire me now to &s;trengthen my &s;elf and have it con|firm'd.</P>
<P>This is all we have to &s;ay at pre&s;ent.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron,</SPEAKER>
<P>We have one Article more to mention, It was &s;aid in the Time of Governour <HI>DUMMER's</HI> Treaty, the Engli&s;h de&s;ir'd to go no further than the Salt|Water reli&s;h'd. The Engli&s;h then told us, they would not &s;tep a Foot over that Li&s;le. It is a very long Foot that reaches from that Line to the Place from whence we came.</P>
<P>This is all we have to &s;ay at pre&s;ent; and we have here the Treaty which we de&s;ire your Excellency to look over, and then return it to us again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>We have Governour <HI>DUMMER</HI>'s Treaty in the &s;ame manner you have, which we brought with us, and we will compare that with your's, and &s;ee that it be &s;ame, and then will make u&s;e of our own.</P>
<P>Which was accordingly done to the Satisfaction of the Tribes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>The Engli&s;h Government think as well as you, that they ought to regulate them&s;elves by Governour <HI>DUMMER</HI>'s Treaty, and that it is binding on our Children and Grand Children, as you have &s;aid. And we are glad you have de&s;ired to walk by Governour <HI>DUMMER</HI>'s Treaty, that we may determine Things by it: And I will look over that Treaty and con&s;ider of it; and of every Thing el&s;e you have &s;aid. And I de&s;ire you would with Openne&s;s and Freedom declare any Thing el&s;e you have to &s;ay now, becau&s;e the great Council of <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> is near at Hand, and we mu&s;t &s;oon go there; And I de&s;ire that we may fini&s;h &s;o that we may have an Opportunity to dine together before our Return to <HI>Bo&s;ton.</HI></P>

<P>I have con&s;idered what Sachem Loron &s;aid Ye&s;terday and what the other Chiefs have now &s;aid, and &s;hall give you an An&s;wer with all Freedom and Sincerity.</P>
<P>The Government of this Province is de&s;irous as well as you, to renew the Treaty made and concluded by Governour <HI>DUMMER</HI> in the Year 1727, at <HI>Ca&s;co-Bay.</HI></P>
<P>We think with you, that we and you, with our and your Children and Grand|Children are bound and obliged to ob&s;erve and perform it.</P>
<P>And you rightly ob&s;erve the &s;aid Treaty to be in writing and <HI>mu&s;t &s;peak for it&s;elf.</HI> And that as you &s;ay, It mu&s;t be con&s;ulted by us both and we mu&s;t be judged and concluded by it.</P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;peak fir&s;t of Trade, becau&s;e you mention'd it fir&s;t.</P>
<P>And it is truly, as you &s;ay, the chief Tye of Friend&s;hip and Union between us and your Tribes.</P>
<P>It is true, That in Governour <HI>DUMMER</HI>'s Treaty you were told, the Engli&s;h would &s;upply you cheaper than any other Nation what&s;oever, in which the <HI>French</HI> mu&s;t be included. And you will find by what I am now going to &s;ay, the Engli&s;h have performed their Agreement with you in that Re&s;pect. The Ju&s;tice of this Government towards you will appear in tho&s;e very Articles you mention'd.</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday you ob&s;erv'd, That in the Year 1727, when Governour <HI>DUMMER</HI>'s Treaty was made, that &s;troud Blankets were 30&s; a piece. Corn 7&s; pr. Bu&s;hel, Powder 4&s;. pr. Pound, Shot at 10<HI>d.</HI> pr. Pound, &s;trip'd Blankets at 20&s; a peice. And I would ob&s;erve to you, that at that Time a Pound of your Bever was &s;old at 9&s;. pr. Pound, and other Peltry in proportion.</P>
<P>We are &s;en&s;ible, that Strouds are now &s;old at the Truck-Hou&s;e from 45&s;. to 50&s;. a piece, Corn is now &s;old at 10&s;. pr. Bu&s;hel, Powder at 7&s;. Shot at 19<HI>d.</HI> &s;trip'd Blankets at 38&s;. Now the &s;ame Strouds which are &s;old to you at <HI>St. George</HI>'s Fort from 45&s;. to 50&s;. a piece, are &s;old at <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> to the Engli&s;h for 52&s;. a piece, Corn is &s;old at <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> from 12&s;. to 16&s;. a Bu&s;hel, Powder at <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> is &s;old for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">. pr.

<P><PB N="11" REF="004976_0011_100E4F1906AB4A68">
I will endeavour to explain to you the Rea&s;on of the Difference between the Prices of the&s;e Goods at the Time of Governour <HI>DUMMER</HI>'s Treaty, and the pre&s;ent Prices.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, It was expre&s;ly told you by Governour <HI>DUMMER</HI> that the Prices of Goods would be &s;ometimes higher and &s;ometimes lower, according to the Plenty or Scarcity of them.</P>
<P>In the next Place the 30&s;. which you ob&s;erve the &s;troud Blankets were &s;old for at the Time of that Treaty was 30&s;. Paper Money. And I would ob&s;erve to you, that the Paper Money &s;ince that Time has &s;unk &s;o much in value, that 55&s;. of it now is worth no more than 30&s;. was then; &s;o that the Blankets which you now give from 45&s;. to 50&s;. for, are not &s;o dear as the Blankets at 30&s;. in the time of Gover|nour <HI>DUMMER</HI>'s Treaty.</P>
<P>To make this Matter &s;till more plain, A Pound of your Bever which the Eng|li&s;h then gave 9&s;. for, they now give 16&s;. for; and yet we do not complain, tho' the Price of your Bever has ro&s;e more upon us, than the Price of our Provi&s;ions upon you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron,</SPEAKER>
<P>As to the Price of Bever that is nothing to the purpo&s;e, for every Thing is at a &s;tand. The Price of Bever and the Goods now are the &s;ame as then.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>To explain this yet further.</P>
<P>A le&s;s Quantity of Bever will purcha&s;e a &s;troud Blanket at this time, than what would purcha&s;e one in Governour <HI>DUMMER</HI>'s time. And it is a Demon&s;tration of the Ju&s;tice of this Government to you, that you have the Goods at the Truck Hou&s;es at a more moderate Price than the Engli&s;h have at <HI>Bo&s;ton.</HI></P>
<P>Another Rea&s;on of the Advance of the Price of our Goods is, that the War with <HI>Spain</HI> and all Parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> at this Time, makes the Powder much dearer than it would otherwi&s;e be, as al&s;o all &s;orts of Provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>And another Proof of our Ju&s;tice and Friend&s;hip is, that the Government lo&s;e con&s;iderably every Year by letting you have their Goods at &s;uch low Prizes, which they do purely out of Friend&s;hip and Kindne&s;s to you.</P>
<P>What is now &s;aid concerns the Ju&s;tice of the Government only.</P>
<P>If you are ever impos'd upon by the Truck Ma&s;ters it's a great Fault, which the Government don't allow of; and when they know it, will always endeavour to prevent.</P>
<P>I don't like that Practice of the Truck-Ma&s;ters which you mention, their tell|ing you what your Bever and Peltry comes to, in the Lump, without giving you a particular Account of it; and then delivering you Goods in exchange for it after the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">me Manner.</P>
<P>This is &s;uch a Method as &s;eems to me to give the Truck-Ma&s;ters room to blind both You and the Government, if they think &s;it.</P>
<P>To prevent this for the future, I &s;hall take care that the Weight of your Bever and Peltry &s;mall be marked down by the Truck-Ma&s;ter; and he &s;hall deliver. you a Bill of Parcels of the quantity and price of Bever, and the Goods p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in exchange for them.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="004976_0012_100E4F1A8E274E68">
By this Means you will have a Paper delivered to you containing the quanti|ty and price of your Bever, and the particulars and price of the Goods delivered to you in exchange for them; and by means of that Paper you will &s;ee whether you are impos'd upon; and if you will complain to the Government you &s;hall always have &s;trict Ju&s;tice done you.</P>
<P>And I will order an Account of the &s;everal Prices of your Peltry andour Goods to be po&s;ted up in the Truck-Hou&s;es, that you may be inform'd of the Prices of both.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. Lewis,</SPEAKER>
<P>That is very well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>This is what Iat pre&s;ent think of; and if the Government at any Time, &s;hall find out other or better Methods to prevent your being impos'dup|on by the Truck-Ma&s;ters, they will do it.</P>
<P>I think it is very rea&s;onable, &s;ince you depend upon &s;upplying your &s;elves at our Truck-Hou&s;es with Provi&s;ions and other Nece&s;&s;aries, that they &s;hould be &s;ufficiently &s;tored with them for your Wants and Demands; therefore the Go|vernment will take Care it &s;hall be done; and will provide &s;ufficient Stores for every particular Per&s;on as they &s;hall want.</P>
<P>And as you have de&s;ired, I will take Care that the Government &s;hall appoint two fit Per&s;ons in the Spring and Fall, with an Interpreter, to view the Truck|Hou&s;es; and you &s;hall have &s;ea&s;onable Notice of it, that if you have any thing to complain of, you may have an Opportunity to be heard by the Per&s;ons &s;o ap|pointed.</P>
<P>As to Mr. <HI>Bradbury</HI> and Mr. <HI>Wood</HI>'s being appointed Truck-Ma&s;ters at <HI>George</HI>'s and <HI>Richmond</HI> Forts, the great Council of the Province which chu&s;e tho&s;e Officers, will always chu&s;e &s;uitable Per&s;ons for that Service. Since you de&s;ire to have Mr. <HI>Bradbury</HI> for your Truck-Ma&s;ter at <HI>St. George</HI>'s, I will recommend him to the great Council.</P>
<P>I think his under&s;tanding your Language is a con&s;iderable Qualification for a Truck-Ma&s;ter; which I doubt not will have it's Weight with them.</P>
<P>I don't find by the Treaty, that Governour <HI>DUMMER</HI> ever promis'd that the Government would (as the <HI>French</HI> did) every Year make you a Pre&s;ent of Pow|der and Shot.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron,</SPEAKER>
<P>It may not be wrote; but it was told us &s;o then.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>As the Treaty is in Writing, we mu&s;t re&s;ort to that for the Truth of Things.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding you never were Friends to the Engli&s;h, as you have been to the French in Time of War, yet this Government have frequently made you con&s;iderable Pre&s;ents; and the Genero&s;ity of the Government will always be proportion'd to your Friend&s;hip to the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>We &s;hall always treat you with Kindne&s;s; but our Pre&s;ents mu&s;t be the Effect of our Friend&s;hip and Genero&s;ity; and not of any Terms of Agreement to make them to you at certain Times and Sea&s;ons.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="004976_0013_100E4F1D340E0108">
The Engli&s;h Government have always look'd upon it as their Honour to treat their Friends with Genero&s;ity.</P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible you &s;upport your &s;elves by hunting in your Woods, and not by Tillage of your Lands as you have ob&s;erv'd.</P>
<P>I therefore think if any of our young Men hunt on your Grounds, it's a great Piece of Inju&s;tice done you; and I &s;hall always look upon it as &s;uch.</P>
<P>And I will recommend it to the great Council to prevent &s;uch Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es be|ing made upon you; and to oblige the young Men for all &s;uch Offences to pay double Damages.</P>
<P>As to the Settlements of Lands, as you ob&s;erv'd Ye&s;terday, Governour <HI>DUM|MER</HI>'s Treaty mu&s;t <HI>judge</HI> between us and decide that Matter.</P>

<P>You have had &s;ome doubt whether <HI>Medockawando</HI> was ever the Sachem of the <HI>Penob&s;cot</HI> Tribe. We find about Fifty four Years ago in our Hi&s;tory and Re|cords that He was your Sachem.</P>
</SP>

<P>One of our old Men, who is now with us here on the Spot was pre&s;ent when <HI>Madockawando</HI> &s;igned the Deed of this Land where the Fort &s;tands, and above a Hundred Indians mo&s;t of whom were of the <HI>Penob&s;cot</HI> Tribe were pre&s;ent and con&s;enting to that Grant and &s;aw the Money paid for the Land, a Hatt-full of Pieces of Eight, and &s;undry Blankets.</P>

<P>As this Government will always be careful that King <HI>GEORGE</HI>'s Subjects &s;hall not take away an Inch of Land from you, &s;o they will always &s;up|port them in their Settlement of Lands to which they have a ju&s;t Right and Pre|ten&s;ion; which you mu&s;t acknowledge to be rea&s;onable, for we &s;hall always keep our Agreements with you, and expect you to keep your Agreements with all King <HI>GEORGE</HI>'s Subjects, both with re&s;pect to Lands and all other Matters.</P>
<P>As to your young Men killing the Hor&s;es; we as well as you are &s;orry for it. Your killing our Cattle does our Inhabitants as much Injury as our taking away your Bever and Guns; they being as nece&s;&s;ary for our Support, as Hunting for yours.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h have always expected, and you have always acknowledged, that when the young Men commit &s;uch Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, they &s;hould make Reparation for &s;uch Damage done. If we &s;hould uphold and countenance our young Men, or you countenance yours in &s;uch Matters, it would &s;oon break all Friend&s;hip be|tween us. It is therefore nece&s;&s;ary for us, when our young Men commit Tre&s;|pa&s;&s;es that they &s;hould be obliged to make Re&s;titution And it is as nece&s;&s;ary that your young Men &s;hould be obliged to do the &s;ame in &s;uch Ca&s;es.</P>

<P>But be&s;ides the Hor&s;es, one Mr. <HI>Kogg</HI> lo&s;t an Ox, which <HI>Ackumbuett's</HI> Sons own, they had killed before Witne&s;&s;es. Another Ox was kili'd which Col. <HI>Lewis</HI> &s;aw the Bones and Hoofs of, (two Engli&s;h Men being pre&s;ent.) As to our young Men making them&s;elves Satisfaction for their Hor&s;es which were killed by taking away your Guns, we don't like it; becau&s;e when either Side pretend to take their own Satisfaction, it will create Quarrels, and break Friend&s;hip; there|fore the Method mu&s;t be to complain to the Government, and leave to them to order proper Satisfaction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Moxus,</SPEAKER>
<P>As for two of the Cattle kill'd by <HI>Ackumbuett's</HI> Son, and my Son; they were in Liquor, and hardly know what they did; when I came to know it I paid 25 &s;. for them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>That Money was paid for a Hor&s;e and Steer that I have not mentioned.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Moxus,</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true. I am mi&s;taken.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>As to the two Oxen which you acknowledge were killed, what Satisfaction do you propo&s;e to make for them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron,</SPEAKER>
<P>As for them, we believe our young Men killed them; and when we return, we &s;hall have a Meeting, and &s;ee that they be paid for.</P>
<P>As to the Hor&s;es, the Guns we think may &s;atisfy for them, and we &s;hould be glad to hear no more about that Matter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>I have appointed two Gentlemen on Oath to apprize the value of the Oxen; and they have valued them at 40 <HI>l.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. Lewis</SPEAKER>
<P>, As to the Oxen I view'd the Bones; and don't think they were &s;o big as Oxen's Bones, and therefore not worth &s;o much.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron,</SPEAKER>
<P>There was a Sloop come in here and &s;he run aground: Two Canoes were coming along and the Sloop Men de&s;ired the Indians to help them, which they did; and for a Reward the Sloop Men made them drunk, put them on the Beach, and before they got &s;ober they loft their Canoes and three Guns.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>We are inform'd, That the Indians came on board of their own accord; and would not leave the Ve&s;&s;el, though often de&s;ired, till they were Drunk; therefore ought to charge their Lo&s;s to their own Folly in drinking too much.</P>

<SPEAKER>Loron,</SPEAKER>
<P>We have been inform'd as I have &s;aid, and thought it true.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>I have many &s;uch Informations, even to the Amount of above three Hundred Pounds; but take no Notice of them becau&s;e they are not &s;uffi|ciently proved.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron,</SPEAKER>
<P>As to the&s;e Things you have mentioned them; and they may be &s;ettled between two or three. And we de&s;ire to mention Things that may con|tinue Friend&s;hip: And for the future, that &s;trict Charges may be given on both Sides to the young Men to do &s;o no more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>The Inhabitants complain, that &s;ometimes your young Men &s;top the Oxen and prevent their bringing Home their Hay.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron,</SPEAKER>
<P>We are old Men, and can't have our Eyes every where.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>You ought to do all you can, to re&s;train your young Men.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron,</SPEAKER>
<P>We are loth to enter into little Complaints, about the Engli&s;h killing our Dogs, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> But are re&s;olved on our Part to endeavour to prevent &s;uch Things for the future. You have an Advantage with regard to re&s;training your young Men, having better Government than we. But we will do what we can in the&s;e Matters.</P>
<P>There was &s;omething forgot about the Truck-Trade Ye&s;terday. One Thing is, that the little Skins call'd Sable-Skins us'd to be &s;old for 10&s;.; but now for 8&s;. We de&s;ire they may be at the fir&s;t Price.</P>
<P>Another about Bear-Skins, they grow &s;carce, and we can't afford to bring them at the cu&s;tomary Price.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>As to the Sable-Skins, we did give 10&s;. a piece for, two Years ago, and &s;old them for 8&s;.; and now we can't get but 8&s;. Therefore as you have our Goods at the &s;ame or le&s;s Price than the People at <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI>; &s;o we ought to give no more for your Peltry than we can get for it there.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron,</SPEAKER>
<P>The Mu&s;quo&s;h Skins &s;ell but for 9<HI>d.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>We wi&s;h they would &s;erch more with us, but they don't.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron,</SPEAKER>
<P>As to what we have &s;aid, your Excellency can't certainly determine with re&s;pect to the Truck-Ma&s;ters, and the Men to view the Truck-Hou&s;es and the Interpreters. However, We hope you will appoint good Men.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>We will do that for our own &s;akes, as well as your's, it being of equal Service to us both.</P>
