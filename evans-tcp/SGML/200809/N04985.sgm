<P>I BEG Leave to offer the following <HI>Reply</HI> to you in par|ticular, and humbly a&s;k your kind <HI>Acceptanc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> of it: I may truly &s;ay, that the being engag'd in a <HI>Controver&s;y</HI> of this Kind, is one of the mo&s;t unexpected <HI>Events</HI> to me that ever I met with: 'Tis not long &s;ince that I had almo&s;t come to a full <HI>Re&s;olution,</HI> never more to offer any <HI>Production</HI> of mine to <HI>publick View;</HI> being &s;omewhat &s;en&s;ible of my <HI>Unfitne&s;s</HI> for Things of that <HI>Nature,</HI> and likewi&s;e de&s;irous of <HI>Peace!</HI></P>

<P>My appearing in Publick, by the fir&s;t <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e</HI> upon <HI>Defen|&s;ive War,</HI> which &s;ome of you were plea&s;ed to <HI>honour</HI> by your <HI>Pre&s;ence,</HI> was not of my own <HI>Motion</HI> or Seeking, but what a little before I had almo&s;t determined again&s;t; having an Aver|&s;ion to <HI>Controver&s;y,</HI> which I knew not but it might occa&s;ion: In the mean Time, you are &s;en&s;ible <HI>Sirs,</HI> that in the afore&s;aid <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e,</HI> I endeavour'd carefully to <HI>guard</HI> again&s;t giving <HI>Cau&s;e</HI> of <HI>Offence</HI> to particular <HI>Per&s;ons</HI> or <HI>Societies,</HI> that were of dif|ferent <HI>Sentiments;</HI> and only offered &s;ome of the <HI>Rea&s;ons</HI> of my <HI>Opinion,</HI> together with an <HI>An&s;wer</HI> to &s;ome Objections.</P>

<P>The INTRODUCTION.</P>
<P>PREVIOUS to my Entrance upon the <HI>Vindication</HI> it&s;elf, I would ob&s;erve, that I have credible Information, that that <HI>Perfor|mance</HI> is highly recommended by many; and has had, a few Days after the fir&s;t, a &s;econd <HI>Edition.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Gentleman</HI> who is the <HI>Author</HI> thereof, is wel|come to examine my Sermon with the &s;evere&s;t <HI>Scrutiny.</HI></P>
<P>If I am mi&s;taken in any Particular in it, I am willing to receive better <HI>Light</HI> and Information from any <HI>Quarter,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fas e&s;t, et ab ho&s;te deceri.</NOTE> and to alter my <HI>Opinion</HI> upon Con|viction by <HI>Scripture</HI> and <HI>Rea&s;on;</HI> for it is TRUTH and the PUBLICK SAFETY, and not <HI>Victory,</HI> I &s;eek.</P>
<P>And doubtle&s;s, the afore&s;aid <HI>Gentleman</HI> has a Right to expre&s;s his Sentiments as well as any others: Nor can I think that <HI>Truth</HI> will lo&s;e Ground by proper <HI>Enquiries;</HI> we are all <HI>Men,</HI> and therefore <HI>fallible Creatures,</HI> liable to manifold Mi&s;takes<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Homo &s;um, et humanum nil a me alienum puto.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the mean Time I can't but admire at the Title of his <HI>Performance!</HI> He is pleas'd to call it, <HI>A Vin|dication of the Doctrine of Chri&s;tianity; as held by the People called</HI> QUAKERS; which &s;eems to in&s;inu|ate, that I had attack'd that <HI>Society</HI> in particular in my Sermon, which I have not done, nor any other.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="006247_0006_10281FE9B5B40FE8">I had no <HI>Party-View</HI> in that <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e:</HI> No! my <HI>De&s;ign</HI> was, and &s;till is <HI>Catholick;</HI> namely, to pro|mote, according to my Capacity, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pro viribus.</NOTE> the common <HI>Safety</HI> of all the <HI>Societies</HI> in the <HI>Colony;</HI> and there|fore I will not intermeddle with <HI>Party-Di&s;putes</HI> in the Cour&s;e of this Debate, any farther than I judge nece&s;&s;ary to open the <HI>Cau&s;e</HI> in <HI>Controver&s;y,</HI> whatever Provocation has been given thereto notwith&s;tand|ing: No! I re&s;olve to keep to the generous <HI>Plan</HI> upon which I have embark'd, and to contend by <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> and <HI>Argument,</HI> for the <HI>Protection</HI> of our <HI>Author,</HI> and the <HI>Society</HI> to which he belongs, as well as others, how di&s;pleas'd &s;oever perhaps he is, or may be, with my <HI>Concern</HI> and <HI>Endeavours</HI> that Way!</P>
<P>Surely this <HI>Gentleman</HI> mu&s;t needs know, that there are divers Per&s;ons in this <HI>Colony,</HI> and that of vari|ous <HI>Denominations,</HI> be&s;ides the <HI>Quakers,</HI> who are a|gain&s;t <HI>Defen&s;ive War,</HI> as well as many of them? Why therefore &s;hould he apply the Sermon to them parti|cularly, more than to others of the &s;ame Way of thinking in that Point?</P>
<P>When I think it my <HI>Duty</HI> to attack any <HI>Society</HI> in particular about their <HI>Principles,</HI> I will endeavour to defend my <HI>Charge</HI> as well as I can; but till then, I de&s;ire to be excus'd.</P>
<P>As to this <HI>Gentleman</HI>'s Intention in the Perfor|mance afore&s;aid, I charitably hope it is as he expre&s;|&s;es it in his Preface. God forbid that I &s;hould con|demn the <HI>States</HI> and <HI>De&s;igns</HI> of tho&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that differ from me in the <HI>Point</HI> under <HI>Debate;</HI> &s;uch as are <HI>truly Re|ligious,</HI> may, I believe, differ in <HI>Principles</HI> that more deeply affect the <HI>Doctrines</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> and yet be &s;incere!</P>
<P>However, I confe&s;s, that the <HI>Time</HI> he chu&s;es for his publick <HI>Animad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er&s;ions</HI> upon a Catholick <HI>Sermon,</HI> calculated to promote the publick <HI>Safety,</HI> is &s;o peril|ous,
<PB N="3" REF="006247_0007_10281FEBD75870C0">
and the <HI>Manner</HI> of his <HI>Management,</HI> in &s;ome In&s;tances, &s;o extraordinary (as I &s;hall afterwards en|deavour to evince) that it is &s;omewhat difficult to reconcile the&s;e Things to his good <HI>Intentions!</HI></P>
<P>One wou'd think that if he didn't believe it to be his Duty to do any Thing of an encouraging Ten|dency towards the noble <HI>De&s;ign</HI> of the ASSOCI|ATION him&s;elf, he might at lea&s;t &s;uffer others unoppos'd, to u&s;e Means for the <HI>Protection</HI> of <HI>him</HI> and the <HI>Society</HI> to which he belongs, among others; and for a longer Time at lea&s;t, agreeable to the <HI>Ro|man</HI> Proverb <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Fe&s;tina leute;</HI> ha&s;ten &s;lowly&punc;</NOTE> have &s;u&s;pended his entering into an <HI>offen&s;ive War</HI>&mdash;Yet &s;till I hope the be&s;t of him, and a&s;cribe his odd Management rather to the <HI>Difficulty</HI> of &s;upporting his <HI>Cau&s;e,</HI> and the Warmth of his <HI>Zeal</HI> for it, than to any bad <HI>De&s;ign!</HI></P>
<P>My Purpo&s;e at pre&s;ent is to enquire into the Me|rits of the Cau&s;e in Controver&s;y, and to reflect no more upon our <HI>Author</HI>'s Management of it (and that with <HI>Reluctance</HI> and Regret) than <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> to the afore&s;aid important <HI>Cau&s;e</HI> nece&s;&s;arily requires.</P>
<P>Per&s;onal Reflections are certainly of little Mo|ment in Controver&s;y: <HI>Truth</HI> &s;hould be received for its own &s;ake, with <HI>Candour</HI> and Readine&s;s, by whom&s;oever it is propo&s;ed, let their <HI>Denomination</HI> and <HI>Character</HI> be what it will, &s;eeing the Qualities of the Per&s;on &s;peaking or writing, cannot enter in|to the Nature of the <HI>Truths</HI> they communicate, or in the lea&s;t alter them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Method</HI> I propo&s;e for my <HI>Reply,</HI> is ju&s;t to examine the <HI>Force</HI> of the <HI>Objections</HI> offered again&s;t the <HI>Arguments</HI> of my Sermon.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Author</HI> begins his <HI>Animadver&s;ions,</HI> by ob&s;er|ving that the Deliverance to which my <HI>Text</HI> refers, was <HI>miraculous</HI>&mdash;wrought without any human Con|trivance or Force.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="006247_0008_10281FF0C2B95788"><HI>An&s;.</HI> Who has &s;aid any Thing to the Contrary? It was not from any Suppo&s;ition of <HI>I&s;rael</HI>'s fighting, at that Time (tho' they were prepared for it, and under Arms) that I drew any Inference in Favour of my Sentiment; but from the FIGHTING of <HI>I&s;rael</HI>'s GOD, and the ju&s;t TITLE a&s;crib'd to him on that Occa&s;ion, <HI>The</HI> LORD <HI>is a</HI> MAN <HI>of</HI> WAR.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Author</HI> again ob&s;erves very ju&s;tly, that the Command to <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> when clo&s;ely pur&s;ued by their Enemies, was, <HI>Fear ye not, &s;tand &s;till, and &s;ee the Salvation of God, the Lord &s;hall fight for you:</HI> But wasn't there good Rea&s;on for their Standing &s;till, when God promi&s;ed to fight for them in a miracu|lous Manner? Mr. <HI>Poole</HI> ob&s;erves, that the Com|mand of &s;tanding &s;till, denotes the calm Po&s;ture of their <HI>Minds,</HI> and not of their Bodies <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Vid. <HI>Poole</HI>'s Annotat. in Loc.</NOTE>: But if any incline to extend the Sen&s;e further, even to the Bo|dy, I &s;hall not contend; no, tho' they them&s;elves &s;hould conform thereto in their own Practice, pro|vided they can get a Promi&s;e from God, that he will fight miraculou&s;ly for them.</P>
<P>But by the by, I confe&s;s I am &s;urpriz'd! that a|ny of the Children of Men, &s;hould be &s;o bold, as to repre&s;ent that to be <HI>Evil</HI> in it&s;elf, and ab&s;olutely for|bid by the <HI>Doctrines</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> which they may ea&s;i|ly perceive God him&s;elf has done, <HI>The Lord &s;hall fight for you, Exod.</HI> xiv. 13. as if it was wicked and contrary to the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> to be like <HI>God;</HI> O &s;trange unaccountable Notion! I forbear to give it the Name, which, in my Opinion, it really de&s;erves!</P>
<P>But our <HI>Author</HI> proceeds to &s;ay, <Q>Tho' &s;ome Wars were commanded of God, under that Di&s;|pen&s;ation, and therefore the&s;e Appellations, <HI>A Man of War, the Lord of Ho&s;ts,</HI> &amp;c. were then &s;uit|able and proper, yet I cannot, &s;aith he, perceive that they di&s;cover any Approbation <HI>of War, be|gun
<PB N="5" REF="006247_0009_10281FF5D290D2A8">
and carried on at the mere Will and Plea&s;ure of Men,</HI> I rather take them to denote the <HI>Great|ne&s;s of his Power and Superiority,</HI> and therefore the <HI>Ju&s;tne&s;s</HI> and Propriety of an <HI>entire Dependance upon God.</HI></Q> And then the Ca&s;e of <HI>Gideon</HI> is intro|duced, who at the Command of God, reduced his Army from 32,000 to 300, and put the mighty <HI>Ho&s;t</HI> of the <HI>Midianites</HI> to Flight; <Q>Here (&s;ays our Author) tho' the U&s;e of outward Means was per|mitted, a &s;trong and entire Dependance upon God was required, even in that Day: Can &s;uch a Dependance be le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary in a Day of Go&s;pel Light?</Q></P>

<P><HI>Query</HI> 1, Can it be rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;ed that the Almighty can command at any Time what is contra|ry to his Nature or Approbation?</P>
<P><HI>Query</HI> 2. Is the Almighty God changed now in his <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Properties,</HI> from what he was under the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Di&s;pen&s;ation?

And if it be, how &s;hocking is the Doc|trine our Author advances? For if <HI>God</HI> changes in his <HI>Nature,</HI> he mu&s;t grow better or wor&s;e; if better, he was imperfect before the Change; if wor&s;e, he is imperfect after it; and con&s;equently either Way he cannot be God!.</P>
<P><HI>Query</HI> 4. How comes our Author to pa&s;s by in entire Silence the Argument I advanced in the Ser|mon he oppo&s;es, to prove that <HI>War</HI> is approved of by the Almighty, which is this (Page 6) <Q>And can we think Sirs, that the Almighty would ac|cept of a Name contrary to his Nature, or &s;uffer him&s;elf to be called by any Thing he di&s;likes or dete&s;ts?</Q> If our Author thinks that <HI>Defen&s;ive War</HI> is contrary to the Divine Nature, why didn't he an&s;wer that Que&s;tion in the Negative, and &s;peak out fairly?</P>
<P><HI>Query</HI> 5.

<P><PB N="7" REF="006247_0011_10281FFAF7E96A60"><HI>Query</HI> 6. Why does our <HI>Author,</HI> in the afore&s;aid Paragraph, in order to remove the Force of my Argument from the afore&s;aid Appellation (mention'd to prove God's Approbation of War) in&s;inuate &s;ome <HI>Contrariety</HI> between God's <HI>Approbation</HI> of <HI>War,</HI> and his <HI>Greatne&s;s, Power, Superiority, Sufficiency,</HI> and our <HI>Dependance</HI> on him: If &s;uch a Contrariety be not in|&s;inuated, how is his Glo&s;s &s;upported?

<P><HI>Query</HI> 7. What does our <HI>Author</HI> bring the In|&s;tance of <HI>Gideon</HI> for? Is it to prove what no Body denies, namely, the Almighty <HI>Power</HI> of God; the Nece&s;&s;ity of entire <HI>Dependance</HI> on God, in the U&s;e of <HI>Means;</HI> if &s;o, it is impertinent to the Point in Debate, and unkind Dealing; for it in&s;inuates, that &s;uch as are now for <HI>Defen&s;ive War,</HI> que&s;tion the <HI>Pow|er</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> and oppo&s;e an entire <HI>Dependance</HI> upon his <HI>Providence.</HI> This In&s;inuation he farther manife&s;ts in the Clo&s;e of the afore&s;aid Paragraph, in the&s;e Words, <Q>Can &s;uch a Dependance be le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary in a Day of Go&s;pel-Light?</Q></P>
<P>Now that &s;uch an In&s;inuation is unrea&s;onable, ap|pears from his own Conce&s;&s;ion beforementioned, whereby he acknowledges a <HI>Permi&s;&s;ion</HI> of the out|ward Means (<HI>viz.</HI> of War) and yet that a &s;trong and entire Dependance upon God was at the &s;ame Time requir'd. Well, if both the&s;e Things were requir'd and con&s;i&s;tent then, why not now?</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="006247_0012_10281FFC853D6E40">Farther: That the afore&s;aid In&s;inuation is unju&s;t, appears from the following Paragraph of the Sermon which he oppo&s;es, <HI>Page</HI> 39; <Q>But, <HI>Sirs,</HI> allow me to ob&s;erve, that tho' outward <HI>Means</HI> are nece&s;&s;ary and excellent in their Place, yet they are not like to be crown'd with <HI>Succe&s;s,</HI> except we look above them to <HI>God</HI> for <HI>Direction</HI> and <HI>A&s;&s;i&s;tance;</HI> except we <HI>repent</HI> of our <HI>Sins,</HI> and <HI>reform</HI> our <HI>Lives!</HI></Q></P>
<P>But if our Author brings the In&s;tance of <HI>Gideon</HI> to prove that the <HI>Mean</HI> of <HI>War</HI> is not at Times ne|ce&s;&s;ary or requir'd by the <HI>Almighty,</HI> he contradicts what he acknowledges, and oppo&s;es the In&s;tance he produces: For tho' <HI>Gideon,</HI> by God's Command, reduc'd his <HI>Army</HI> to a &s;mall Number, yet i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> didn't reduce the Number to nothing; and with that &s;mall Number that remain'd, he us'd diver&s;e <HI>Stratagems</HI> to obtain <HI>Victory;</HI> he divided it into three <HI>Battalions</HI> to make the greater Appearance; made his De&s;cent in the <HI>Night,</HI> when he was lea&s;t expected, in order to put the Enemy into Con&s;ternation!

<P><HI>Query</HI> 8. Why does our Author, in the In&s;tance of <HI>Gideon,</HI> at fir&s;t &s;peak of God's commanding and directing him, and his obeying; and yet a Line or two afterwards, when he comes to make mention of the U&s;e of outward Means, Why does he change the Form of Expre&s;&s;ion into the &s;oft Word <HI>permit|ted?</HI> 'Tho' the U&s;e of outward Means was <HI>permit|ted.</HI>' Had he no De&s;ign in this?</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t ha&s;ten to the next Paragraph, which &s;peaks of God's prohibiting <HI>David</HI>'s building the <HI>Temple.</HI> For An&s;wer to this Objection I refer the

Reader to two Sermons upon <HI>Exodus</HI> xv. 3. now in Mr. <HI>Bradford</HI>'s Pre&s;s, and &s;hall only add a little by Way of <HI>Reply,</HI> to two Particulars in the latter Part of the afore&s;aid Paragraph, (V. P. 5,) where our Author,</P>

<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> A Freedom from the Di&s;turbances and Injuries con&s;equent upon <HI>offen&s;ive War,</HI> is, no doubt, a valuable Priviledge in many Re&s;pects; and what therefore we &s;hould not only de&s;ire after, but labour for, by oppo&s;ing with all our Might, under <HI>God,</HI> the cruel <HI>Cau&s;e</HI> of tho&s;e <HI>Mi&s;eries (viz. offen&s;ive War.)</HI> I therefore commend our Author's <HI>Zeal,</HI> in taking Pains to write again&s;t that <HI>great Iniquity</HI> (tho' I cou'd wi&s;h he had done it with more Di&s;tinctne&s;s, and then the Trouble of a <HI>Reply</HI> wou'd have been prevented.)

<P><HI>Query</HI> 1. Was not God repre&s;ented as full of Mercy under the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Di&s;pen&s;ation? See <HI>Exod.</HI> xxxiv. 6, 7. <HI>And the Lord pa&s;&s;ed by before him, and

<P><HI>Query</HI> 2. Is not JUSTICE the Foundation of DE|FENSIVE WAR? And isn't God invariably ju&s;t, as well as merciful, in his <HI>Nature?</HI> Is not <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> one of his e&s;&s;ential <HI>Attributes?</HI> And if &s;o, will it not follow, that he is, and always will be inclined to ap|prove of <HI>Defen&s;ive War,</HI> when there is a Nece&s;&s;ity of it, &s;o long as he retains the &s;ame <HI>Nature?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Query</HI> 3. Is there not a perfect and perpe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ual <HI>Har|mony</HI> between the <HI>Mercy</HI> and <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> of <HI>God?</HI> What is his <HI>Mercy</HI> or <HI>Love,</HI> but a <HI>Property</HI> of his <HI>Nature,</HI> inclining him to vouch&s;afe Kindne&s;&s;es upon his peni|tent and believing Creatures?

<P>Now, tho' there be a Difference in the <HI>Objects</HI> up|on which tho&s;e divine <HI>Perfections</HI> terminate in their outward Acts; yet there is none in the <HI>Principle</HI> of them; no! it is the &s;ame divine <HI>Nature,</HI> producing wi&s;ely and voluntarily various <HI>Effects</HI> upon different <HI>Objects,</HI> &s;uitable to the different <HI>Occa&s;ions</HI> that pre|&s;ent them&s;elves, and in &s;uch a <HI>Way</HI> as &s;erves to an|&s;wer

<P N="1">1. That what was <HI>moral,</HI> or, in other Words, a|greeable in it&s;elf to the divine <HI>Nature</HI> then, is &s;o now; and con&s;equently <HI>Defen&s;ive War</HI> is lawful. Or,</P>

<P>Now, &s;eeing that from <HI>Truth</HI> nothing but <HI>Truth</HI> will flow<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">It is a Maxim in Philo&s;ophy, <HI>Quod ex veris nil ni&s;i verum.</HI></NOTE>, it is therefore evident, that the <HI>Princi|ple</HI> from which tho&s;e <HI>Ab&s;urdities</HI> do naturally and freely proceed, mu&s;t needs be fal&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> The De|nial of the Lawfulne&s;s of <HI>Defen&s;ive War.</HI></P>

<P><PB N="12" REF="006247_0016_1028200C440CF4F0">Our Author ob&s;erves upon the afore&s;aid Words as follows, in his V.

<P>To which I an&s;wer, that the Sen&s;e our Author puts upon my Words (The only Mean) is forced, as may appear from the very Paragraph of the Ser|mon that immediately precedes what he has cited, (except one) in which I &s;peak thus: <Q><HI>War</HI> is no doubt lawful, and con&s;equently approved by God, when undertaken by the <HI>Magi&s;trate</HI> for the Pu|ni&s;hment of &s;ome great <HI>Injury</HI> or Wrong, which much affects the <HI>Credit</HI> and <HI>Intere&s;t</HI> of a Nation or People, after all &s;ofter Means fail of Succe&s;s;</Q>
<HI>i. e.</HI> All human <HI>outward Means;</HI> this Sen&s;e the Se|ries of the Sermon naturally leads to. Now, there being a Connection between this and the other Para|graph, the Sen&s;e of the Words (Only Mean) mu&s;t be the &s;ame, <HI>viz.</HI> The only <HI>human</HI> or outward <HI>Mean;</HI> it was about &s;uch, and &s;uch only, that I was rea&s;oning, and therefore it was a Force upon the Words to put that Sen&s;e upon them, which our Au|thor has done. This will appear more plainly from what I have &s;aid in the Improvement of the Sub|ject (S. p. 39) where it was proper that I &s;hould &s;peak of <HI>&s;piritual Means;</HI> the Words are the&s;e;</P>
<P><Q>But Sirs allow me to ob&s;erve, that tho' <HI>out|ward Means</HI> are nece&s;&s;ary and excellent in their Place, yet they are not like to be crowned with <HI>Succe&s;s,</HI> except we look above them to God for Direction and A&s;&s;i&s;tance; except we repent of our Sins, and reform our Lives.</Q> Here I plainly di|&s;tingui&s;h between outward and &s;piritual Means, a&s;|&s;ert a Nece&s;&s;ity of, and yet an In&s;ufficiency in both,

without the Concurrence of Providence, to an&s;wer the End de&s;ign'd.</P>
<P>Yet our Author is plea&s;ed to put a hard Sen&s;e upon the Words afore&s;aid, and thence takes Occa|&s;ion to que&s;tion my Belief of an overruling, omni|pre&s;ent Providence, and &s;o gravely &s;ets about the Proof of it for my Conviction <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Calumniare fortiter, &amp; aliquid adherebit.</NOTE>.

<P>The next Objection, which is <HI>Vind. p.</HI> 8. Here our Author cites Mr. <HI>Poole</HI>'s Annotations on <HI>Sam.</HI> xxx. 7. and labours to make that learned and con&s;i|&s;tent Man's Writings &s;erve a Purpo&s;e contrary to his profe&s;&s;ed Sentiments, but in vain: All that can be rea&s;onably inferred from Mr. <HI>Poole</HI>'s Glo&s;s is this. That it was their Duty under that Di&s;pen&s;ation to con&s;ult the <HI>Urim</HI> and <HI>Thummim</HI> upon the High-prie&s;t's <HI>Brea&s;tplate,</HI> for immediate Information and Direction in &s;ome difficult Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>Upon the afore&s;aid In&s;tance our Author &s;peaks thus, <HI>p.</HI> 8. <Q>If then it had been an Error, not to have enquired of God, in &s;o pinching a Ca&s;e as this, the Con&s;equence fairly deducible is, That &s;hould we be in the like Circum&s;tances, we mu&s;t make the like Enquiry, and receive the divine Per|mi&s;&s;ion and Command, otherwi&s;e <HI>David</HI>'s Exam|ple will not be wholly followed.</Q></P>
<P>I an&s;wer, That if we were under the &s;ame <HI>Di&s;|pen&s;ation</HI> with <HI>David,</HI> the Con&s;equence would be
<PB N="14" REF="006247_0018_10282012593C9240">
ju&s;t and fair, that in the &s;ame Circum&s;tances we &s;hould make the like Enquiry; but otherwi&s;e the Con&s;equence is not fair; from different Premi&s;es the &s;ame Conclu&s;ion cannot flow, and &s;o the Ca&s;e is here.</P>
<P>In this <HI>Di&s;pen&s;ation</HI> we have no temporal <HI>High-prie&s;t,</HI> with the <HI>Urim</HI> and <HI>Thummim</HI> upon his <HI>Brea&s;t|plate,</HI> from whom we may expect immediate and o|racular An&s;wers about Things to come; and there|fore it is not po&s;&s;ible for us, in this State of Things, <HI>wholly to follow</HI> David's <HI>Example.</HI></P>
<P>Nor have we any Nece&s;&s;ity for, or Promi&s;e of immediate objective <HI>Revelation,</HI> in place of the <HI>Jewi&s;h Urim,</HI> in the ordinary Times of the Go&s;pel, from Chri&s;t our <HI>High-prie&s;t,</HI> in any Matters what|&s;oever, whether temporal or &s;piritual, by <HI>Vi&s;ions, Voices,</HI> &amp;c. &s;eeing <HI>the Prophecy is &s;ealed,</HI> the <HI>Ca|non</HI> of <HI>Scriptures</HI> is compleated, and <HI>able to make the Man of God perfect, and thoroughly furni&s;hed to eve|ry good Work.</HI></P>
<P>It is enough, that we have in place of the <HI>Urim</HI> a greater Mea&s;ure of the Influences of the holy Spirit than the pious <HI>Jews</HI> ordinarily enjoyed, enlightening our Minds in the U&s;e of appointed Means, to the right under&s;tanding of the Meaning of the holy Scriptures, and enabling us to believe their divine Authority; and &s;o impre&s;&s;ing the Truths contained in them upon our <HI>Hearts,</HI> as to transform them in|to the divine <HI>Image,</HI> and reform our Practice, a|greeable to the divine <HI>Law:</HI> This I call <HI>&s;ubjective Revelation,</HI> which is nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation.</P>
<P>It is true, the Apo&s;tles were immediately in&s;pired, or had an <HI>objective,</HI> infallible <HI>Revelation</HI> of new <HI>Truths,</HI> in the &s;ame extraordinary Manner which the Prophets of old had; and it was nece&s;&s;ary it &s;hould be &s;o in the Beginning of the Chri&s;tian <HI>In&s;titution,</HI> &s;eeing they were to commit to Writing a <HI>Rule</HI> to di|rect

<P>But in the ordinary Times of the Go&s;pel, after the <HI>Doctrines</HI> of Religion were &s;ufficiently confirm|ed by miraculous Works, and the <HI>Rule</HI> of <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Practice</HI> fully committed to Writing, there is no Need of extraordinary <HI>In&s;piration,</HI> or miraculous <HI>Works,</HI> the holy <HI>Scriptures,</HI> the &s;anctifying Influ|ences of the ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Spirit,</HI> the Di&s;pen&s;ations of di|vine <HI>Providence,</HI> together with the &s;ober U&s;e of our own <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> are &s;ufficient to direct us in every Du|ty we owe to <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Man.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover it may be ob&s;erved, that <HI>David</HI> did not in the afore&s;aid In&s;tance, con&s;ult the <HI>Ephod,</HI> whether it was lawful to go to War in general, but whether it was expedient for him to pur&s;ue the <HI>Amalekites</HI> at that Time in particular, and what would be the <HI>I&s;&s;ue</HI> of it, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> xxx. 8.

<P>Nor do we find that the <HI>Jews</HI> always con&s;ulted the <HI>Urim,</HI> re&s;pecting every of their Battles; and we know not that <HI>Abraham</HI> had any to con&s;ult a|bout his famous Fight with <HI>Chederla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mer</HI>&mdash;Yet he was at no Lo&s;s about his Duty, in that Affair, but directly obey'd the Call of Providence.</P>
<P>Our Author &s;ilently pa&s;&s;es over what I have &s;aid in the 9 <HI>p.</HI> of the <HI>Ser.</HI> re&s;pecting the prudential Care that People take, in &s;ecuring of their temporal Goods; and the Advice of King <HI>A&s;a</HI> to fortify their Cities, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as well as the Inference drawn from it, of pre&s;erving our Lives, which are a more valu|able Depo&s;itum (<HI>S. p.</HI> 10) and proceeds to confute my Argument from the <HI>Light</HI> of <HI>Nature,</HI> which he has tho't proper not to mention, and only finds Fault with my &s;aying, that it was from God; and then labours to remove the Force of the Argument, by a Di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>Now in order to have a ju&s;t View of this Matter, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to cite my Argument and his An|&s;wer, and then propo&s;e a few Queries.</P>
<P>The Argument in the Sermnon, is as follows (<HI>p.</HI> 10) <Q>It is true, Man was originally created for the maintaining of Peace with his Fellows, and to this all the Laws of Nature, re&s;pecting others, have a primary Regard; yet when milder Mea&s;ures can|not

&s;creen us from intollerable Injuries, the <HI>Light</HI> of <HI>Nature</HI> directs to fly to Force as the la&s;t Reme|dy, the la&s;t Re&s;ource; for the <HI>Obligation</HI> to the Offices of <HI>Peace</HI> is mutual, and binds all alike. Nature hath given no Man a Priviledge of break|ing her Laws at Plea&s;ure towards others, and yet obliged them to maintain the <HI>Peace</HI> towards him: No; the Duty being mutual, &s;hould be mutual|ly performed; and he that violates the Laws of Peace, and &s;eeks another's De&s;truction, may im|pute to his own Wickedne&s;s, all the Mi&s;ery which another is nece&s;&s;itated in his own Defence, and in Pur&s;uit of the Principle of it, to inflict upon him.</Q></P>
<P>Our Author's An&s;wer is expre&s;&s;ed thus, <Q>The fir&s;t Proof propo&s;ed in the Sermon, that War in the foregoing In&s;tances is lawful, is from the Light of Nature; and I &s;hould not have attack'd the Arguments drawn from thence, had not the Wri|ter thereof a&s;ked, <HI>"Who is the Author thereof but God him&s;elf?"</HI> The following Di&s;tinction &s;eems therefore nece&s;&s;ary to be made: God crea|ted Man good, upright and holy, and had he con|tinued in this State, there never would have been <HI>any War, and con&s;equently no Need of Self-de|fence:</HI> But Man falling, thro' Di&s;obedience, his Nature became corrupted, his Faculties depraved, and the whole intellectual Sy&s;tem di&s;ordered; thus began &s;hedding of Blood, and the Earth was early filled with Violence. This was the unhap|py Con&s;equence of Sin. I hope this Writer will not venture to &s;ay, that God was the Author of Nature thus corrupted; the Nature, and the Light of Nature, that he was Author of, was ho|ly, <HI>innocent</HI> and <HI>perfect;</HI> but the Corruption in Nature, from whence proceeded Violence and Blood&s;hed, was occa&s;ioned by adhering to the Voice of <HI>Satan.</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="006247_0022_102820229FC0BD08">To which I reply, as follows; Is it &s;o, accord+ing to our Author's Acknowledgment, that had Man continued in his primitive, good, upright and holy State, there never would have been any <HI>War,</HI> and con&s;equently NO NEED OF SELF-DEFENCE; then it naturally follows, from his own Method of Rea&s;oning, that there is now Need of SELF-DE|FENCE: Seeing, as he ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, Man is fallen and corrupted. By War, our Author &s;eems here plainly to mean <HI>Offen&s;ive War,</HI> and gives a brief, but &s;ub&s;tantial Hint of the Nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>Self-defence</HI> (and con&s;equently of <HI>Defen&s;ive War,</HI> which is the &s;ame) again&s;t it. This is whol&s;ome Doctrine in|deed, and the very Sum of all that I have been con|tending for in the Sermon; the natural and ea&s;y Sen&s;e of the Words afore&s;aid, is this; If innocent Man had continued in his original Integrity, there would have been no Violence committed, and con|&s;equently no Need of Defence again&s;t it; but now Man is fallen, degenerate and corrupted, inclin'd to commit Acts of Violence, and to &s;hed Blood, and therefore there is a Nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>Self-defence,</HI> to &s;creen us from that Violence; and thus our Author indeed rea&s;ons well in that Particular, but in the mean time gives up his Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>But this Con&s;equence he &s;eems to oppo&s;e, by ob|&s;erving what confirms it, namely, That Violence proceeded from the Corruption of Nature, and was occa&s;ioned by adhering to the Voice of Satan; very true, all unju&s;t Violence, or <HI>Offen&s;ive War</HI> (which is the &s;ame Thing in other Words) proceeds from tho&s;e criminal Cau&s;es, and therefore there is a Ne|ce&s;&s;ity of <HI>Self-defence,</HI> or of <HI>Defen&s;ive War,</HI> to op|po&s;e and &s;uppre&s;s that <HI>Violence,</HI> that Iniquity: Now ina&s;much as <HI>Self-defence</HI> does oppo&s;e and tends to &s;ubdue it, it mu&s;t needs proceed from a contrary, and therefore a good Cau&s;e; unle&s;s our Author &s;up|po&s;es
<PB N="19" REF="006247_0023_10282025C59B5D20">
that the &s;ame Cau&s;e will produce contrary Ef|fects, which is ab&s;urd and impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Our Author is plea&s;ed to expre&s;s &s;ome Charity to|wards me, in the afore&s;aid Paragraph, by &s;aying that he hopes I will not venture to &s;ay, that God was the Author of Nature thus corrupted; after ac|knowledging my Obligations to the Gentleman, for his charitable Sentime<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ts,</P>
<P>I An&s;wer, That Nature, and the Corruption of Nature, are two di&s;tinct and different Things; GOD is the Author of the former, but by no Means of the latter: By <HI>Nature</HI> I under&s;tand our very BE|INGS; and by the Corruption of Nature, any Di&s;|conformity to the moral Law of <HI>God,</HI> that cleaves to them in Man's fallen <HI>State.</HI></P>
<P>There is likewi&s;e a great Difference between the Light of Nature, even in Man's fallen State, and the corrupt Inclinations of Nature; the&s;e often op|po&s;e each other in Things moral, and therefore can|not be the &s;ame; this inward <HI>Conflict</HI> between <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Lu&s;t,</HI> divers <HI>Pagans</HI> perceived and lamented<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Video meliora proboque, deteriora Sequer.

<P>But to make this Matter &s;till more plain, and ea&s;y to be under&s;tood, let it be ob&s;erved, that I &s;hewed in the Sermon what I meant by the Law of Nature (which this Gentleman has taken no Notice of) namely, &s;omething that was &s;ub&s;tantially the &s;ame with the Moral Law, <HI>p.</HI> 14.</P>
<P>It plea&s;ed GOD when he made Man, to impre&s;s upon his Mind, a Knowledge of the <HI>Offices</HI> which it was proper for him to perform towards GOD, his <HI>Neighbour</HI> and <HI>him&s;elf;</HI> this Knowledge was doubt|le&s;s

impair'd by Man's Apo&s;tacy, yet there are &s;till &s;uch Remains of it in the human Mind, as &s;hew (if &s;uitably attended to and improved) the principal moral Duties required of us; this I conceive the A|po&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> confirms, <HI>Rom.</HI> ii. 14, 15. <HI>For when the Gentiles which have not the Law, do by Nature the Things contained in the Law (i. e.</HI> the moral Law revealed in the Scriptures) <HI>were a Law unto them&s;elves, which &s;hew the Work of the Law writ|ten in their Hearts,</HI> or &s;ome remaining Notices of it engraven upon their rational Nature; <HI>Their Con&s;ci|ences bearing Witne&s;s, and their Thoughts the mean while accu&s;ing or excu&s;ing one another.</HI></P>
<P>Now tho' this Light of Nature be in a fallen corrupted Creature, yet it came originally from GOD, who is <HI>the Author of every good Gift;</HI> and hence <HI>Solomon</HI> calls the <HI>Spirit of Man the Candle of the Lord:</HI> It is true it is le&s;s in Degree and Influence than that which <HI>Adam</HI> enjoyed, yet it is and mu&s;t be of the &s;ame Kind, ina&s;much as it oppo&s;es the &s;ame moral Evils, and directs to the &s;ame moral Good, as far as it reaches.</P>
<P>It is called the Light and Law of Nature in a good Sen&s;e (which the Word Nature is capable of, as well as a bad) becau&s;e the fir&s;t Man received it together with his Nature or Being in Perfection, and we the <HI>Remains</HI> of it with ours.

<P>The Light of Nature directs to <HI>Health</HI> in the fir&s;t Place, by the U&s;e of all proper Means, and chu&s;es it as the mo&s;t agreeable State; but in Ca&s;e of Sick|ne&s;s, pre&s;cribes the U&s;e of Phy&s;ick, tho' di&s;agreeable to our Inclinations, becau&s;e medicinal and nece&s;&s;ary for the Recovery of our <HI>Health.</HI></P>
<P>And thus, undoubtedly, the &s;ame Light and Law of Nature directs to pur&s;ue Peace with our <HI>Neighbours</HI> in the fir&s;t Place, and chu&s;es it as the mo&s;t de&s;irable Condition; but when this is lo&s;t, thro' the <HI>Inju&s;tice</HI> of others, in important <HI>In&s;tances,</HI> and cannot be recovered by gentle <HI>Methods,</HI> the Light of Nature directs to the U&s;e of Force to obtain it, ei|ther by the Civil Law, or by <HI>Self-defence,</HI> and <HI>War</HI> as the la&s;t <HI>Remedy,</HI> which we are drove to with <HI>Reluctance,</HI> and by extream <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity.</HI></P>
<P>But to proceed, our <HI>Author</HI> ob&s;erves in the afore|&s;aid Paragraph, <Q>That the Light of Nature which God was the Author of, was <HI>holy</HI> and <HI>innocent:</HI></Q> Which implies, that the <HI>Light</HI> of <HI>Nature</HI> in Man's fallen State, is &s;inful and guilty; and this he con|firms in the following Words; <Q>For it is not from the <HI>degenerate fallen Light of Nature,</HI> that Argu|ments are to be drawn, for the Formation of Chri&s;tian Principles, neither are any from it of any Weight in Oppo&s;ition thereto.</Q></P>

<P><Q>He that &s;uffers his Life to be taken from him, by One that hath no Authority for that Purpo&s;e, when he might pre&s;erve it by Defence, incurs the Guilt of <HI>Self-murder:</HI> Since <HI>God</HI> hath enjoined him to &s;eek the Continuance of his <HI>Life,</HI> and <HI>Na|ture</HI> it&s;elf teaches every Creature to defend it&s;elf when a&s;&s;aulted: In Particular, Nature hath not only given to Man a quick Sen&s;e of <HI>Injuries,</HI> that he might not &s;uffer him&s;elf to be oppre&s;&s;ed and in|&s;ulted, but &s;he hath al&s;o <HI>armed</HI> him with <HI>Strength</HI> and Ability of <HI>Body,</HI> that he &s;hould not be forced tamely and &s;ordidly to &s;ubmit!

<P N="5">5. That he who &s;uffers &s;uch, whom he has Rea|&s;on to conclude have a murderous Intention to a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;inate him, and con&s;equently without <HI>Re&s;i&s;tance</HI> to kill him, may be &s;aid <HI>interpretatively</HI> to con&s;ent to their murderous <HI>De&s;ign;</HI> becau&s;e he oppo&s;es not, by all proper <HI>Means</HI> in his <HI>Power,</HI> the Execution of it.

<P>The &s;econd Exception of our <HI>Author</HI> again&s;t the Charge afore&s;aid, is his Rea&s;oning from the De&s;crip|tion of Murder already mentioned, in the following Manner, <HI>namely,</HI>
<Q>That the Ca&s;e in the Sermon does not reach the afore&s;aid De&s;cription, unle&s;s we can &s;uppo&s;e, he who does not endeavour to de|fend him&s;elf, is unactive, from a wilful and deli|berate De&s;ire of being killed.</Q></P>

In the mean time, as the Prophet <HI>Ezekiel</HI> informs us, <HI>Who|&s;oever

<P>Suppo&s;ing a pious Per&s;on ab&s;tains totally from <HI>Food,</HI> with a religious De&s;ign, to be conformed to the <HI>Example</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s <HI>Fa&s;ting,</HI> and pre&s;umptuou&s;|ly expecting to be miraculou&s;ly &s;upported without <HI>Food</HI> for Forty Days, dies in that Space, woudn't he be guilty of <HI>Self-murder</HI> in &s;ome Degree, tho' his Crime is not &s;o heinous and aggravated, as if he de|&s;igned his own <HI>Death?</HI> But I proceed to the third Exception, which is this: <Q>It is without doubt, &s;ays our <HI>Author,</HI> every Man's <HI>Duty</HI> to u&s;e proper <HI>Means</HI> for the Pre&s;ervation of <HI>Life;</HI> but if any Man thinks that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> hath forbidden him the U&s;e of <HI>military Preparations,</HI> and yet will u&s;e them, they are to him very improper <HI>Means.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Here ob&s;erve, that in the afore&s;aid Paragraph our <HI>Author tacitly</HI> acknowledges the Lawfulne&s;s of <HI>mili|tary Preparations</HI> in them&s;elves, as <HI>Means</HI> to pre|&s;erve Life; and that it is every Man's Duty to u&s;e them, who reckons them lawful; which is indeed a giving up of his whole <HI>Cau&s;e.</HI> Great is the Power of <HI>Truth</HI>

<P>This Notion likewi&s;e ju&s;tifies all the <HI>Per&s;ecutions,</HI> or <HI>Sufferings</HI> upon a <HI>religious Account,</HI> which the <HI>Quakers</HI> have endured, at any Time or Place, &s;ince they have appeared in the World; in ca&s;e that tho&s;e who oppre&s;&s;ed them, tho't it their <HI>Duty</HI> &s;o to do, which Charity obliges us to hope they did, at lea&s;t &s;ome of them.</P>
<P>Now why does our Author appear as an <HI>Advo|cate</HI> for the <HI>Quakers</HI> unattack'd, and yet in the mean Time, hold a <HI>Principle,</HI> that in its natural Con&s;e|quences, ju&s;tifies all their unrea&s;onable Sufferings? Is this rational? Is this con&s;i&s;tent?</P>
<P>Our Author takes Notice of another Pa&s;&s;age in the Sermon, <HI>p.</HI> 13. <HI>viz.</HI> this, <Q>Well, if <HI>Self-mur|der</HI> be a heinous Sin, it will follow by the Law of Contraries, that Self-defence is an important Duty: Surely he who is unju&s;tly attacked, and does not endeavour by &s;uitable Means to pre&s;erve his Life, e&s;pecially if there be any probability of Succe&s;s, in &s;o doing betrays it, and &s;o is guilty of <HI>Suicide;</HI> a Crime of the fir&s;t Magnitude and deepe&s;t Dye!</Q></P>
<P><Q>Upon this Pa&s;&s;age (faith our Author) I would

<P><Q>Where there is one (&s;aith our Author, <HI>V. p.</HI> 16) who take it in its fir&s;t Sen&s;e (<HI>i. e.</HI> the Sixth Command as forbidding War) &s;lain, are there not many Thou&s;ands of the latter killed in the Prac|tice of Fighting?</Q></P>
<P>I An&s;wer, It may be &s;o; but in the mean Time, if tho&s;e that hold the Doctrine of ab&s;olute Non-Re|&s;i&s;tance, are not &s;lain, they have Rea&s;on to thank tho&s;e under GOD for their <HI>Protection,</HI> who hold <HI>Defen&s;ive War,</HI> and therefore &s;hou'dn't &s;light them, and condemn them upon that Account!</P>

<P>I An&s;wer, They are, in my Opinion, alike; for he that rightly prepares for <HI>Defence,</HI> provides a <HI>Hiding-place</HI> from the Enemy, a <HI>Fort</HI> and In&s;tru|ments of <HI>War,</HI> to &s;creen him from their <HI>Vengeance;</HI> and are not the&s;e Things the Intention of a <HI>Hiding-place,</HI> viz. to <HI>conceal</HI> and <HI>protect?</HI></P>

<P><Q>Now if the Almighty has approved of War formerly, and there is &s;till the &s;ame Nece&s;&s;ity of it, under the Go&s;pel-Di&s;pen&s;ation as before, it will follow, that it is equally lawful now: It is ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e, that the ble&s;&s;ed God, who is infinite in Wi&s;dom, and unalterable in his Nature, would determine contrarily at different Periods of

Time, concerning a Ca&s;e that is &s;ub&s;tantially the &s;ame!</Q></P>
<P>Upon which our Author remarks as follows, <Q>If this Manner of Arguing proves any Thing, it proves Offen&s;ive War, as lawful as De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ive. God approved of the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> taking away the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of many Nations: He commanded them to de&s;troy &s;ome utterly; is it therefore e|qually lawful to do &s;o now, whether we have this Command or not?</Q></P>
<P>To which I reply, That Almighty GOD never commanded <HI>Offen&s;ive War</HI> (properly and &s;trictly &s;o called) Perhaps this may be reckoned by &s;ome a <HI>Paradox;</HI> but I think it is a plain Truth; the afore&s;aid In&s;tances are not <HI>Offen&s;ive War,</HI> which is the unju&s;t <HI>Inva&s;ion</HI> of another's <HI>Right;</HI> for the ble&s;&s;ed God, who is the ab&s;olute and original <HI>Pro|prietor</HI> of all, transferred the civil <HI>Right</HI> of tho&s;e Nations, which they forfeited by Sin, to the Peo|ple of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> previous to, or before their taking Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion thereof; and, as ab&s;olute <HI>Lord</HI> of <HI>Life,</HI> and a righteous <HI>Governor</HI> and <HI>Judge,</HI> for their ex|traordinary <HI>Wickedne&s;s,</HI> gave his People <HI>I&s;rael</HI> Au|thority and Commi&s;&s;ion to puni&s;h them, and put them to Death. In the former In&s;tance, they did but take forcible Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their own Country and Goods; and in the latter, they were but <HI>Executio|ners</HI> of <HI>judicial Puni&s;hment</HI> under a proper <HI>Authori|ty,</HI> and therefore there was nothing of <HI>Offen&s;ive War</HI> in tho&s;e Things.</P>
<P>The <HI>Almighty</HI> never did, nor, to &s;peak with Re|verence, ever can, in a Con&s;i&s;tency with the <HI>Purity</HI> and Perfection of his <HI>Nature,</HI> enjoin &s;uch a <HI>wicked</HI> and abominable Thing as <HI>Offen&s;ive War!</HI></P>
<P>It is true the Manner of conveying the afore&s;aid <HI>civil Right,</HI> and <HI>penal Authority,</HI> was extraordinary and immediate, peculiarly &s;uited to that Di&s;pen&s;a|tion,
<PB N="49" REF="006247_0053_1028208D1834F9C8">
which was a <HI>Theocracy, God</HI> him&s;elf being their <HI>King,</HI> in an extraordinary and immediate Way; a Priviledge which no other Nation ever had, or, &s;o far as we know, are like to have.</P>
<P>And therefore not only <HI>civil Rights,</HI> and <HI>judicial Power</HI> and Authority, are conveyed always <HI>mediate|ly</HI> to other Nations, by ordinary human <HI>Means,</HI> ac|cording to the different <HI>Laws,</HI> Con&s;titutions and Cu&s;toms of Countries; but al&s;o the claiming the afore|&s;aid <HI>Rights,</HI> and exerci&s;ing the afore&s;aid <HI>Authority,</HI> mu&s;t be <HI>mediate</HI> al&s;o, regulated by human <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> agreeable to the <HI>Laws</HI> of different <HI>States</HI> and <HI>King|doms.</HI></P>
<P>Hence if the <HI>Almighty</HI> &s;hould in an extraordinary and immediate Manner, give to any a <HI>Right</HI> to o|thers <HI>Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions,</HI> there wou'd be Need of infallible and immediate <HI>Revelation,</HI> to a&s;&s;ure us of this Mat|ter; nor could we &s;afely act before it, in either of of the above In&s;tances.</P>
<P>But there is no Need of immediate Revelation, to inform or a&s;&s;ure us of the&s;e <HI>civil Rights,</HI> or <HI>civil Authority,</HI> which are convey'd to us in an ordinary <HI>Channel,</HI> we are apt to know them full well with|out.</P>
<P>Nor need we any new <HI>Revelation</HI> to inform us of a <HI>Truth</HI> that is engraven with indelible Charac|ters upon our rational Natures, as with the Point of a <HI>Diamond,</HI> and written with a <HI>Sun-beam</HI> upon a great Variety of Pages in the &s;acred Volume; namely, That we &s;hould <HI>defend</HI> our&s;elves and <HI>Properties.</HI></P>
<P>Nor do we need a new <HI>Revelation</HI> to in&s;truct us, when to prepare for, and endeavour the afore&s;aid <HI>Defence,</HI> the <HI>Providence</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> together with our own <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> will ea&s;ily, when attended to, point out the <HI>Time,</HI> as they do in other temporal Ca&s;es.</P>

<P><Q>It is &s;trange to think, and hard to reconcile it with any ju&s;t Notion of divine Goodne&s;s, that Almighty God, &s;hou'd under this la&s;t and brighte&s;t Di&s;pen&s;ation of his Grace towards the Children of Men, in&s;tead of enlarging dimini&s;h our <HI>Priviledges,</HI> and that in &s;o tender and impor|tant a Point!

<P N="3">3.

<P N="1">1. That our <HI>Author begs the Que&s;tion</HI> in <HI>Debate; namely,</HI> That not any Part of the <HI>moral Law</HI> en|joins <HI>War.</HI> Whether a <HI>Defen&s;ive War</HI> be not implied

<P N="2">2. My <HI>Opponent,</HI> in the afore&s;aid Paragraph, re|ally, as I conceive, gives up the <HI>Cau&s;e</HI> for which he contends; for he acknowledges that this is proved by the <HI>Parallel</HI> of <HI>Meroz,</HI> namely, <Q>That it is a Sin to neglect going to War in the Cau&s;e of God, when he calls to it.</Q></P>
<P>And only endeavours to &s;creen him&s;elf from the Con&s;equence of the afore&s;aid Conce&s;&s;ion, by this &s;lender Pretext, <HI>namely,</HI>
<Q>This cannot at all operate again&s;t tho&s;e that refu&s;e fighting, becau&s;e they ap|prehend God hath forbidden it.</Q> This Argument I have before con&s;idered&mdash;to which I refer the Read|er, and &s;hall only add a few Words, together with the Sentiment of <HI>Grotius</HI> upon this Head.</P>
<P>The afore&s;aid Pretext or Apology, directly tends, &s;o far as I can &s;ee, intirely to overthrow all the in|trin&s;ick or <HI>inward Goodne&s;s</HI> or <HI>Badne&s;s</HI> of <HI>human Ac|tions,</HI> and con&s;equently to make both <HI>Scripture</HI> and <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> a mere <HI>No&s;e</HI> of <HI>Wax!</HI></P>

<P>I do declare, that I had it not in the Thoughts of my <HI>Heart,</HI> to offer any <HI>Charge</HI> again&s;t the People of his <HI>Profe&s;&s;ion</HI> about <HI>Cowardice,</HI> and therefore was not a little &s;urprized to meet with our Author's <HI>Animad|ver&s;ions</HI> upon this Head!</P>

<P>And pray, have not divers of both our <HI>Profe&s;|&s;ions</HI> actually done &s;o (for Sub&s;tance) at the Time of the fir&s;t Settlement of this Country?

<P>Is this In&s;tance of our Author's Conduct calm and con&s;i&s;tent? I will a&s;&s;ure him, that the <HI>Sermon</HI> he is di&s;plea&s;ed with, was not framed to &s;erve the narrow and comparatively mean <HI>De&s;igns</HI> of a <HI>Party,</HI> but to promote the common <HI>Benefit</HI> of all the <HI>Societies</HI> of the <HI>Province,</HI> in their <HI>Protection</HI> from impending <HI>Danger</HI> and <HI>Calamity!</HI></P>
<P>But to proceed: Our Author, in order to recon|cile <HI>God</HI>'s commanding <HI>War,</HI> under the Old Te&s;ta|ment, to his (&s;uppo&s;ed) prohibiting it now, propo&s;es this Expedient, <HI>Vind. p.</HI> 20.21. <HI>namely,</HI> he <Q>be|&s;eeches his Readers to remember, that <HI>he &s;uffered and required many Things of the</HI> Jews, <HI>becau&s;e of the Hardne&s;s of their Hearts,</HI> which was not to continue in his Church, after the bright Di&s;covery of his <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> was manife&s;ted.&mdash;Is it therefore rea|&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that this univer&s;al, glorious De|&s;ign, admits of War and Fighting, e&s;pecially be|tween &s;uch Nations as profe&s;s to be under the Go|vernment of the &s;ame Lord and Lawgiver?</Q></P>
<P>Now, in order to &s;hew that the afore&s;aid <HI>Expedi|ent</HI> will not an&s;wer his <HI>De&s;ign,</HI> I &s;hall fir&s;t mention Mr. <HI>Poole</HI>'s Interpretation of the Place of Scripture
<PB N="56" REF="006247_0060_102820A457A43B18">
his Words refer to, <HI>namely, Mat.</HI> xix. 8. where Chri&s;t &s;aith, <HI>Mo&s;es, becau&s;e of the Hardne&s;s of your Hearts, &s;uffered you to put away your Wives, but from the Beginning it was not &s;o.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Poole</HI> ob&s;erves thus upon the afore&s;aid Words: <Q>The Sub&s;tance of our Saviour's An&s;wer &s;eemeth to be this, <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> gave you no po&s;itive <HI>Command</HI> in the Ca&s;e, he could not make a <HI>Law</HI> directly oppo&s;ite to the Law of my <HI>Father.</HI> But <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> &s;aw the Wantonne&s;s and Wickedne&s;s of your Hearts, that you wou'd turn away your <HI>Wives</HI> without any ju&s;t or warrantable Cau&s;e; and to re&s;train your Extravagance of <HI>Cruelty</HI> to your <HI>Wives,</HI> or di&s;or|derly turning of them off, upon any Occa&s;ion, he made a Law that none &s;hould put away his Wife, but upon a legal Cognizance of the Cau&s;e, and gi|ving her a Bill of Divorce: And you by your <HI>Traditions</HI> have expounded that Law beyond <HI>Mo|&s;es</HI> his Intention, and made a Bill of Divorce, grantable in Ca&s;es which he never tho't of, nor in|tended in that Law: But the <HI>Mea&s;ures</HI> of <HI>Law|fulne&s;s,</HI> are neither to be taken from <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> his temporary <HI>Toleration,</HI> and much le&s;s from your <HI>Traditions</HI> and Expo&s;itions of the Law of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> but from the original In&s;titution of Marriage, and from God's original Law in Relation to it.</Q> The above Expo&s;ition of the Place, I apprehend to be ju&s;t and genuine.</P>
<P>I wou'd therefore ob&s;erve, that the <HI>Author</HI> of the <HI>V.</HI> goes upon a wrong <HI>Foundation</HI> in the afore&s;aid Paragraph; and hence his Super&s;tructure cannot be good<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Stabit opus melius, &s;i bene fixa ba&s;is, i. e.</HI> If the Foundation be well laid, the Super&s;tructure will &s;tand the better; but on the Contrary, <HI>Debile fundamentum fallit opus.</HI> A weak Foun|dation ruins the Fabrick.</NOTE>.

of the Paragraph, <HI>&s;uffered and required many Things;</HI> but <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;aith it was <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> that <HI>&s;uffered,</HI> not <HI>requi|red,</HI> the <HI>Jews to put away their Wives,</HI> which was but one Thing; this is a &s;trange complicated Mi&s;|take.</P>
<P>It is admirable that our <HI>Author</HI> &s;hou'd a&s;cribe to <HI>God</HI> by Way of <HI>Command</HI> (for does'nt the Word <HI>Required</HI> &s;ignify as much) what was only a tempo|rary <HI>Permi&s;&s;ion</HI> of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and thus contradict our <HI>Saviour</HI>'s expre&s;s <HI>Declaration,</HI> in no le&s;s than three Particulars at one <HI>Da&s;h;</HI> but I hope it was thro' Inadvertency that our <HI>Author</HI> fell into this unhappy <HI>Mi&s;take,</HI> and that when he con&s;iders the Matter far|ther, he will correct it.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, can it be tho't, with the lea&s;t Shadow of Rea&s;on, that from &s;uch a <HI>Foundation,</HI> any good <HI>Conclu&s;ion</HI> can be drawn again&s;t <HI>Defen&s;ive War,</HI> which GOD the Father, and GOD the Son, repeatedly commanded, approved of, and encou|raged with their <HI>Pre&s;ence</HI> and <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">See the Sermons upon <HI>Exodus</HI> xv. 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is likewi&s;e probable that our <HI>Author</HI> meant al|&s;o the <HI>Jewi&s;h Ceremonies,</HI> but the&s;e Things being <HI>Shadows</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> mu&s;t of Con&s;equence expire and evani&s;h, when the <HI>Sun</HI> the <HI>Sub&s;tance</HI> came; but where is there any Ground to believe, that <HI>War</HI> is a <HI>Type</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t;</HI> and if &s;o, wou'dn't it conclude what my Opponent doesn't like, namely, that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is an eminent <HI>Warrior,</HI> &s;eeing that the <HI>Type</HI> is eminently included in the <HI>Antitype.</HI></P>
<P>Farther, the <HI>Jewi&s;h Sacrifices</HI> and <HI>Ceremonies,</HI> were Things in them&s;elves indifferent and innocent, antecedent to, or before the divine <HI>Precepts</HI> concern|ing them, and therefore might by divine <HI>Sovereignty</HI> be for a Time enjoined, without any Contradiction to the <HI>Purity</HI> and other <HI>moral Perfections</HI> of the divine <HI>Nature;</HI> but the Ca&s;e is not &s;o as to War, it can be

no Matter of Indifferency in it&s;elf, for it con&s;i&s;ts not in the &s;hedding the <HI>Blood</HI> of <HI>Bea&s;ts,</HI> but of <HI>Men;</HI> and therefore if it be not <HI>morally Good,</HI> it is <HI>morally</HI> EVIL in it&s;elf, before the divine <HI>Precept</HI> re&s;pecting it: El&s;e there is no &s;uch Thing in any In&s;tance, and all <HI>Virtue</HI> and <HI>Vice</HI> are empty <HI>Names,</HI> and meer <HI>Cyphers,</HI> that have no Foundation in the <HI>Nature</HI> of <HI>Things;</HI> and thus the very <HI>Ba&s;is</HI> of all <HI>Virtue</HI> and <HI>Religion</HI> is &s;app'd: A doleful Stroke indeed!</P>
<P>For what can more deeply concern the Manners of Men, than the taking away the <HI>human Life?</HI> Which puts a final <HI>Period</HI> to our State of <HI>Trial,</HI> and fixes unalterably our everla&s;ting <HI>Condition:</HI> Hence one of the&s;e two Things follows, either that <HI>God</HI> Almighty commanded, encouraged and ap|proved of frequently, what is in it&s;elf <HI>morally Evil,</HI> or el&s;e that <HI>Defen&s;ive War</HI> is in its own <HI>Nature, mo|rally Good,</HI> and con&s;equently lawful now.</P>
<P>As to the latter Part of the afore&s;aid Paragraph, I an&s;wer in the Affirmative; that it is, in my Appre|hen&s;ion, rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that the univer&s;al glorious <HI>De&s;ign</HI> of the <HI>Go&s;pel-Di&s;pen&s;ation</HI> admits of <HI>Defen&s;ive War</HI> and <HI>Fighting,</HI> when Nece&s;&s;ity requires, even between <HI>Nations</HI> that profe&s;s to be under the <HI>Government</HI> of the &s;ame <HI>Lord</HI> and Lawgiver, for the&s;e Rea&s;ons;</P>
<P N="1">1. Becau&s;e it is under the afore&s;aid Limitations <HI>morally Good,</HI> as, I hope, appears from what has been already &s;aid. And,</P>
<P N="2">2. Becau&s;e being &s;o, it cannot of it&s;elf have a Tendency to Contention or Confu&s;ion, or any Thing that is <HI>Evil;</HI> what is Good, cannot in it&s;elf tend to what is bad; except it be &s;uppo&s;ed that a <HI>Cau&s;e</HI> produces <HI>Effects</HI> contrary in <HI>Kind</HI> to it&s;elf; which is ab&s;urd, and contrary to the very <HI>Nature</HI> of Things! For thus, upon this <HI>Hypothe&s;is,

Light</HI> would produce <HI>Darkne&s;s,</HI> and Darkne&s;s Light.</P>
<P>Nay, it is &s;o far from this, that the Doctrine of <HI>Defen&s;ive War</HI> directly tends to keep the wor&s;t of Men from <HI>Inju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>Violence,</HI> by affecting their <HI>Fear,</HI> with a <HI>View</HI> of the <HI>Penalties</HI> they are like to incur thereby; this tends to teach Men <HI>Wi&s;dom,</HI> as pious <HI>Gideon</HI> taught the Men of <HI>Succoth,</HI> with the <HI>Briars</HI> and <HI>Thorns</HI> of the <HI>Wilderne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>Whereas the contrary Opinion, by removing the Arguments of <HI>Fear</HI> and Terror from the Impeni|tent, which generally have the mo&s;t Influence to re|&s;train them from the <HI>Evils</HI> they <HI>love,</HI> tends to give an ungovernable <HI>Loo&s;e</HI> to their <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions</HI> and <HI>Appe|tites,</HI> and &s;o opens a <HI>Door</HI> to Violence and Confu&s;i|on, and every evil Work, and therefore in the pre|&s;ent degenerate <HI>State</HI> of Mankind, it is of dangerous and pernicious Con&s;equence!</P>
<P>Not to add that this Method of affecting the <HI>Fear</HI> of Men, by the threatning of <HI>Puni&s;hment</HI> again&s;t Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, proportioned to their Crimes, and of inflicting it when there is Occa&s;ion, and in this Way endeavouring to deter them from Iniquity; I &s;ay this is the very Method which the ble&s;&s;ed <HI>God</HI> him&s;elf takes with Mankind, in his <HI>Word</HI> written, and by his <HI>Providence,</HI> of which there are innume|rable In&s;tances; Doesn't the Almighty <HI>hedge up</HI> frequently <HI>the Way of Sinners with Thorns,</HI> to keep them within proper Bounds? Does'n't the allwi&s;e <HI>God</HI> in the holy Scriptures denounce <HI>Threatnings</HI> of temporal Puni&s;hments, again&s;t Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors? And doesn't he at Times inflict them, and therefore from hence, may he not be ju&s;tly called even now, <HI>A Man of War?</HI> And does it not ea&s;ily follow, from what has been &s;aid under this Head, that all &s;uch who oppo&s;e <HI>a ju&s;t War</HI> as unlawful under the <HI>Go&s;|pel,</HI> do con&s;equently (tho' I tru&s;t not de&s;ignedly)

<P><Q>Can we think, my Brethren, that <HI>God</HI> would enjoin and approve of any Practice formerly, that was contrary to the <HI>moral Law</HI> and <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> which the <HI>Jews</HI> enjoy'd? Surely No! That is contrary to his unalterable <HI>Purity,</HI> of which the <HI>moral Law</HI> is a legible <HI>Copy</HI> and <HI>Exemplar.</HI> Well, if a ju&s;t <HI>War</HI> was not contrary to the <HI>moral Law</HI> under the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Di&s;pen&s;ation, and before it, why &s;hould it be &s;o now, in the like Circum&s;tances of <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity?</HI> And if it be not contrary to the <HI>moral Law,</HI> the &s;tanding and unalterable <HI>Rule</HI> of our <HI>Conduct,</HI> why &s;hould any &s;cruple it, or oppo&s;e it now?</Q></P>

prevent our being impo&s;ed upon, by a meer Sound of <HI>har&s;h Words.</HI></P>
<P>Our Author next proceeds to a Paragraph in the <HI>Sermon, p.</HI> 20. with which the 18 and 19 <HI>p.</HI> have a Connection, which &s;eeing he has tho't proper, per|haps for prudential Rea&s;ons, to give but a brief Hint of, I will take the Liberty to cite more large|ly, as follows:</P>
<P><Q>And &s;hould not the <HI>Magi&s;trate</HI> protect his <HI>Subjects</HI> from unju&s;t <HI>Violence?</HI> Is not this the <HI>De&s;ign</HI> of their <HI>Office, that under them we may live quiet Lives,</HI> and that they may be to us a <HI>Hiding-place from the Wind, and a Covert from the Tempe&s;t</HI> of Op|pre&s;&s;ion! Why el&s;e is the <HI>Sword</HI> committed to them, and can they always <HI>protect</HI> us without <HI>War,</HI> with|out oppo&s;ing Force to Force? No &s;urely!</Q></P>
<P><Q>Now unle&s;s the <HI>Magi&s;trate</HI> puni&s;hes <HI>Criminals</HI> in his own <HI>Community,</HI> and &s;creens his <HI>Subjects</HI> from a <HI>foreign Force,</HI> what is his <HI>Office</HI> but an empty <HI>Name,</HI> a meer <HI>Cypher,</HI> of no Moment and Con&s;equence to <HI>Society?</HI> Nor is it rea&s;onable he &s;hould expect <HI>Support, Honour</HI> and <HI>Obedience,</HI> from his <HI>Subjects,</HI> if they in Con&s;equence hereof, do not obtain <HI>Pro|tection</HI> from him. In the mean Time it &s;hould be carefully ob&s;erved, that the <HI>Magi&s;trate's Office,</HI> and con&s;equently the <HI>Duties</HI> of it, does not belong to the <HI>political Laws</HI> of the <HI>Jews,</HI> which were alterable, but to the <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rel,</HI> which was invariable and per|petual. Surely by the Word PARENT in the Fifth COMMAND, we are not only to under&s;tand natu|ral, but political Parents; the MAGISTRATE is the FATHER of his COUNTRY by OFFICE, and then only indeed does he merit that honourable <HI>Character,</HI> and act up to it, when by forming and executing whol&s;ome penal <HI>Laws,</HI> he &s;uppre&s;|&s;es <HI>Inju&s;tice</HI> among his <HI>Children,</HI> when by prudent and nece&s;&s;ary Preparations, and when Nece&s;&s;ity

May he according to the expre&s;s Word of God, puni&s;h <HI>his criminal Subjects</HI> with <HI>Death,</HI> in &s;ome Ca&s;es, agreeable to that famous Scripture, <HI>He that &s;heds Man's Blood, by Man &s;hall his Blood be &s;hed;</HI> and &s;hall he not inflict it upon others equal|ly guilty, e&s;pecially when this becomes nece&s;&s;ary to <HI>defend him&s;elf</HI> and his <HI>Country</HI> from <HI>De&s;olation</HI> and <HI>Ruin?</HI> Can it be rea&s;onably imagined, that a <HI>Magi&s;trate</HI> &s;hould &s;hew greater <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Cle|mency</HI> to Foreigners and <HI>Strangers,</HI> than to his own <HI>Sons</HI> and <HI>Subjects,</HI> to whom he is under pe|culiar <HI>Obligations,</HI> both natural and political?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Nor has our Lord Je&s;us, in the New-Te&s;ta|ment, di&s;anulled the Magi&s;trate's <HI>Office,</HI> which is &s;o needful to <HI>Society;</HI> No! But on the contrary honoured and e&s;tabli&s;h'd it, by his <HI>Doctrine</HI> and <HI>Example;</HI> he enjoined his Di&s;ciples, <HI>To give to Cae&s;ar the Things that are Cae&s;ar's, to give Honour to whom Honour is due, and Tribute to whom Tribute; to be &s;ubject to the higher Powers, and that for this Rea&s;on, becau&s;e there is no Power but of God, and the Powers that be, are ordained of God;</HI> and he him&s;elf paid <HI>Tribute,</HI> yea rather than this important <HI>Duty</HI> &s;hould be neglected, he procured <HI>Money</HI> by a <HI>Miracle.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Now let us hear how our <HI>Author</HI> an&s;wers to the afore&s;aid <HI>Argument,</HI> which I look upon to be the Chief that I have offered, upon which the whole

Cau&s;e very much re&s;ts; his An&s;wer is as follows (<HI>V. p.</HI> 22, 23)</P>
<P><Q><HI>Upon which I remark, that whenever</HI> the Ma|gi&s;trate is convinced that the Doctrines of Chri&s;t forbid War, it will be as much his Duty, as any other Man's, to render Obedience to tho&s;e Doc|trines. However the People called Quakers, do not undertake to condemn their Superiors engaging in War, in the pre&s;ent unhappy State of human Af|fairs: <HI>We rather</HI> think it probable, <HI>that as they have &s;hewn a noble and Chri&s;tian Di&s;po&s;ition, in granting Liberty and Protection to &s;uch as are of tender Con&s;ciences,</HI> it may plea&s;e God to ble&s;s their Arms with Succe&s;s, <HI>and reward them for their Kindne&s;s to his People, who de&s;ire to live in Obe|dience to the inward Appearance of his Spirit, which leads to</HI> Purity <HI>and</HI> Perfection: <HI>And agree|able to the Advice of the Apo&s;tle</HI> Paul, <HI>we find it our</HI> Duty, to put up Prayers for Kings, and them that are in Authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable Life, in all Godline&s;s and Hone&s;ty, <HI>1</HI> Tim. <HI>ii. 1, 2.</HI></Q></P>
<P>To which I reply,</P>
<P N="1">1. That if it be the <HI>Magi&s;trate</HI>'s <HI>Duty,</HI> to <HI>render Obedience</HI> to the <HI>Doctrines</HI> that <HI>forbid War,</HI> when <HI>convinced,</HI> then he mu&s;t either quit his <HI>Office,</HI> or bear the <HI>Sword,</HI> the <HI>En&s;ign</HI> of it, in vain; for in this Way, the <HI>End</HI> of that <HI>In&s;titution</HI> cannot be an&s;wered; but the latter is ab&s;urd; namely, to carry an empty Title, a <HI>Name</HI> without the <HI>Thing,</HI> and therefore the former mu&s;t take Place; and hence it follows, That if all <HI>Magi&s;trates</HI> were con|vinced as afore&s;aid, they mu&s;t all, wou'd they act with Decency and Con&s;i&s;tency, quit their <HI>Places,</HI> and then there wou'd be no <HI>Government</HI> at all! Doesn't therefore this <HI>Doctrine</HI> of <HI>ab&s;olute Non-Re|&s;i&s;tance</HI> de&s;troy <HI>Magi&s;tracy</HI> at a <HI>Stroke?</HI> And thus this

Is it the <HI>Magi&s;trate</HI>'s <HI>Duty</HI> to <HI>protect</HI> his <HI>Subjects</HI> or not? If nay, then his <HI>Of|fice</HI> is a meer <HI>Bubble,</HI> which only de&s;erves to be laugh'd at; if yea, then <HI>Defen&s;ive War</HI> is included in the <HI>moral Law,</HI> and con&s;equently is lawful now; unle&s;s it be &s;uppos'd, that the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> oppo&s;es and de&s;troys the <HI>moral Law,</HI> which as it is contrary to the expre&s;s <HI>Declaration</HI> of Chri&s;t him&s;elf, el&s;ewhere cited in this <HI>Reply,</HI> &s;o it tends to tear up by the <HI>Roots</HI> all <HI>Virtue</HI> and <HI>Religion,</HI> at one di&s;mal <HI>Da&s;h!</HI></P>
<P>If our Author had faulted any Part of the prece|ding <HI>Train</HI> of <HI>Rea&s;onings</HI> about the <HI>Magi&s;tracy,</HI> he &s;hould have declared it; but &s;eeing he has not, his Silence gives Con&s;ent to the whole, which therefore concludes to the <HI>Overthrow</HI> of his <HI>Cau&s;e!</HI></P>

<P>Well, if they don't condemn them, they ju&s;tify them; for there is no <HI>Medium,</HI> unle&s;s the Mind be in Su&s;pence and undetermin'd on which Side of the Que&s;tion <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Duty</HI> lies; and if they ju&s;tify their <HI>Superiors</HI> engaging in <HI>War,</HI> they cannot con&s;i&s;t|ently condemn <HI>Inferiors</HI> that war under them, &s;ee|ing that <HI>Princes</HI> cannot <HI>war</HI> without <HI>Soldiers.</HI> But our Author proceeds to inform us,</P>

Then how comes our <HI>Author,</HI> who ap|pears under the <HI>Character</HI> of their <HI>Apologi&s;t</HI> (before an <HI>Attack</HI>) to contradict them &s;o much in his pre|&s;ent Performance? In his Preface he declares, that <HI>War</HI> is <HI>ab&s;olutely forbid</HI> by the <HI>Doctrines</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t;</HI>
<Q>I thought, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> the Sermon was to prove that agreeable to the Doctrines of Chri&s;t, which is ab&s;o|lutely forbid thereby.</Q> Now, what was the <HI>Scheme</HI> of the <HI>Sermon</HI> to prove but <HI>Defen&s;ive War?</HI> The <HI>Title</HI> and whole <HI>Frame</HI> of it &s;hew this.

<P>Yea, &s;o great is the <HI>Evil</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed to be, that our Author informs us, <HI>Vind. p.</HI> 3. That &s;uch who hold it <HI>doctrinally,</HI> are to be excluded from <HI>Church Fellow&s;hip;</HI>

<P><HI>Query</HI> 4. Is there no Appearance (at lea&s;t) of great <HI>Uncharitablene&s;s</HI> in the afore&s;aid Paragraph, in confining Per&s;ons of <HI>tender Con&s;ciences,</HI> and <HI>true Chri&s;tianity,</HI> to the narrow Pale of the <HI>Quaker So|ciety,</HI> or peculiar Principles? <HI>To his People, who de|&s;ire to live in Obedience to the inward Appearance of his Spirit, which leads to Purity and Perfection?</HI> Now, who can we under&s;tand by tho&s;e Terms a|greeable to our Author's <HI>Vind.</HI> but &s;uch as are for immediate <HI>In&s;piration,</HI> and again&s;t <HI>Defen&s;ive War?</HI> Isn't Gratitude expre&s;&s;ed for <HI>Liberty</HI> granted to tho&s;e, and to no others; and a <HI>Hope</HI> of <HI>Succe&s;s</HI> upon our <HI>So|vereign</HI>'s <HI>Arms,</HI> grounded alone upon that <HI>Founda|tion?</HI> Isn't this &s;trange and hard to account for?</P>
<P>But, ble&s;&s;ed be <HI>God,</HI> whatever our Author may imagine to the contrary, <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s <HI>Sheep</HI> are not cooped up in one <HI>Fold,</HI> but &s;cattered in many; we have Rea&s;on to rejoice that the Lord is to be our Judge, and not &s;hort &s;ighted Creatures.</P>
<P>Here I would beg Leave to tran&s;cribe the Senti|ment of the learned <HI>Grotius</HI> upon that famous <HI>Scrip|ture</HI> cited by our <HI>Author,</HI> 1 Tim. ii. 1, 2, 3. <HI>I ex|hort therefore, that fir&s;t of all Supplications, Pray|ers, Interce&s;&s;ions, be made for all Men; for Kings, and all in Authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable Life in all Godline&s;s and Hone&s;ty.

<Q>We are taught three Things; 1. That it is plea&s;ing to God that <HI>Kings</HI> &s;hould become <HI>Chri&s;tians.</HI> 2.

<P>The next Particular taken notice of by my <HI>Oppo|nent,</HI> Mr. <HI>S.</HI> is what I have &s;aid upon the Coun&s;el of <HI>John the Bapti&s;t</HI> to the Soldiers, S. p. 20. the Force of which he endeavours to evade by three Ex|ceptions. 1. He &s;ays, 'They were <HI>Roman Soldiers.</HI>' An&s;wer, What then? Should not they be told their Duty for that Rea&s;on? 2. <Q>If ab&s;taining from War be the <HI>Perfection</HI> of the <HI>Chri&s;tian Religion</HI> (&s;ays Mr. <HI>S. V.</HI> p. 23) that is a Point the mo&s;t dif|cult to be learnt, is it likely or rea&s;onable to ex|pect that <HI>John,</HI> upon the Pagan Soldiers fir&s;t Ap|plcation, &s;hould declare that to them?</Q></P>
<P>An&s;wer, Here our <HI>Author,</HI> as u&s;ual, begs the <HI>Que&s;tion</HI> in <HI>Di&s;pute.</HI> I deny ab&s;taining from War totally to be any <HI>Point</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI> at all; it is &s;o far from a <HI>Perfection</HI> in it.</P>
<P N="3">3. Mr. <HI>S.</HI> tells us what he would do. An&s;wer, What is that to the Purpo&s;e? It is what he &s;hould do we enquire after, and not the other. If he would not reprove Men for what he reckons &s;inful, who can help that? Farther, he enquires, towards the Clo&s;e of his Paragraph, p. 24. Can War &s;ub&s;i&s;t

without Violence? An&s;wer, Yes, without private Violence or Ravages. The <HI>Roman</HI> Laws, tho' they allowed <HI>Soldiers</HI> to take Prey from Enemies, yet did not permit the lea&s;t Injury to Friends <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vid. Annot. Bez. &amp; Calv. in Loc.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>If the&s;e Words, <HI>do Violence to no Man,</HI> be con|&s;idered in a con&s;i&s;tent View with the other Part of the Advice, <HI>to be content with their Wages,</HI> it can rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed to mean no more, than to ab&s;tain from <HI>private Plunders</HI> and <HI>Ravages,</HI> an <HI>E|vil</HI> which <HI>Soldiers</HI> are at Times under &s;trong Temp|tations to!</P>
<P>Or that they &s;hould beware of engaging in an <HI>un|ju&s;t War,</HI> or of exerci&s;ing Inhumanity and Cruelty towards tho&s;e they conquered by a ju&s;t One, &s;eeing his advi&s;ing them to be content with their Wages, is a tacite Approbation of that Work for which they received them.</P>
<P>The Abu&s;es of War by &s;ome can be no ju&s;t Ar|gument again&s;t the regular U&s;e of it. It is true, it is attended with di&s;tre&s;&s;ing Circum&s;tances; but it is as true, that the utter Rejection of it, and being in|tirely <HI>pa&s;&s;ive</HI> under the <HI>Rage</HI> and <HI>Ravages</HI> of aban|doned <HI>Banditti,</HI> is much more &s;o; and indeed this makes us <HI>criminal,</HI> as well as <HI>mi&s;erable!</HI></P>
<P>Our <HI>Author</HI> next attacks my Argument from the In&s;tance of the <HI>Centurion,</HI> S. p. 21. This he en|deavours to confute, <HI>V. p.</HI> 24, 25. The Grounds he goes upon are two, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. His u&s;ual <HI>begging</HI> of the <HI>Que&s;tion</HI> in <HI>Controver|&s;y,</HI> he takes it for granted, that the Denial of every kind of War is a Point of <HI>Perfection</HI> in <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> which I ab&s;olutely deny; and upon this <HI>Foundation,</HI> which he has offered no Arguments in his whole <HI>Performance</HI> to e&s;tabli&s;h, he proceeds farther to ob|&s;erve, that our Lord knew the be&s;t Method to deal
<PB N="75" REF="006247_0079_102820EDCEBE3F08">
with frail Mortals, was to lead them by Degrees to <HI>Perfection.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer;</HI> This is not applicable to his <HI>Argument,</HI> unle&s;s he had fir&s;t proved, that the rejecting of <HI>De|fen&s;ive War</HI> was a <HI>Point</HI> of <HI>Perfection.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. He labours to divert the Force of my Argu|ment, by ob&s;erving, that if the <HI>Sermon-writer</HI> could have proved, that after this Miracle, which our Lord wrought, that if the <HI>Centurion</HI> had retained his <HI>military Employ,</HI> there would have been &s;ome Foun|dation for my Argument.</P>
<P>I reply, it is a <HI>Mi&s;take;</HI> an Argument of Right is va&s;tly better than from <HI>Fact,</HI> in fallible, imperfect <HI>Creatures:</HI> I enquired what was his Duty to do, and not what he did; it is not by the <HI>Examples</HI> of <HI>Men,</HI> but by the <HI>Laws</HI> of God, that we &s;hould re|gulate our Conduct!</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, &s;eeing our Author's <HI>Opinion</HI> &s;uppo&s;es the <HI>Repeal</HI> of an e&s;tabli&s;hed <HI>Practice,</HI> it is his Bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;hew, that the Centurion did not retain his <HI>mili|tary Office:</HI> We do not find that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;aid a Word again&s;t his Continuance in it; No! but on the con|trary, he el&s;ewhere <HI>commands to render to Ce&s;ar the Things that are Ce&s;ar's;</HI> among which was the TRI|BUTE MONEY, wherewith the SOLDIERS were SUP|PORTED. Now, if this had been &s;imply unlawful, would CHRIST have enjoined it for that End, with|out <HI>Reproof,</HI> yea, and paid the <HI>Tribute Him&s;elf?</HI> Doesn't CHRIST'S PRECEPTS and PRACTICE, re|&s;pecting the TRIBUTE MONEY, plainly imply his <HI>Approbation</HI> of a ju&s;t or <HI>Defen&s;ive War?</HI></P>
<P>My <HI>Argument</HI> is not drawn from the <HI>Centuri|on</HI>'s not laying down his <HI>Office,</HI> but from Chri&s;t's not enjoining him &s;o to do.</P>
<P>The next Argument in the <HI>Sermon</HI> that Mr. <HI>S.</HI> is plea&s;ed to animadvert upon, is that from <HI>John</HI> xviii. 36. <HI>My Kingdom is not of this World, el&s;e
<PB N="76" REF="006247_0080_102820F1E73B8C70">
would my Servants fight, that I &s;hould not be deliver|ed to the Jews,</HI> S. p. 22.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Author,</HI> to compa&s;s his End, cites Mr. <HI>Poole</HI>'s Annotations on the Place; which, tho' they &s;hew that it was not the <HI>Duty</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s <HI>Di&s;ciples</HI> to <HI>fight</HI> for his <HI>Protection,</HI> in his pre&s;ent extraordinary <HI>Situation,</HI> or to promote his <HI>&s;piritual Kingdom;</HI> yet they confirm the Point I had in View in my Ar|gument in the&s;e Words, <HI>viz.</HI>
<Q>For was there ever an earthly Prince apprehended and bound, for whom none of his <HI>Servants</HI> would take up <HI>Arms?</HI></Q></P>
<P>But Mr. <HI>S.</HI> de&s;ires me to con&s;ider, whether Chri&s;t's directing us to <HI>pray, That his Will may be done in Earth, as it is in Heaven, does not much more clearly expre&s;s an Injunction to live in Love and Peace?</HI> I an&s;wer, <HI>Defen&s;ive War</HI> is con&s;i&s;tent with <HI>Love,</HI> as I have before &s;hewn; if not, what be|comes of the Magi&s;trate? See this Matter opened in the Sermon, p. 31, 32. which it &s;eems our Au|thor thought it prudent to pa&s;s over in Silence;&mdash;and is it not the De&s;ign of <HI>Defen&s;ive War</HI> to procure <HI>Peace</HI> by <HI>Con&s;traint?</HI> Moreover, the <HI>Angels</HI> in <HI>Hea|ven</HI> are Warriors, as appears from the preceding Sermons!</P>
<P><HI>Religion</HI> is one Thing, and human <HI>Society</HI> is ano|ther; the former is &s;piritual, the latter temporal; and therefore &s;piritual Weapons are &s;uited in Nature and Kind to the one, and temporal to the other: How unrea&s;onable is it therefore to &s;uppo&s;e, that be|cau&s;e Chri&s;t's <HI>Reign</HI> in the Soul, which is a &s;piritual Thing, cannot be promoted or maintained by <HI>tem|poral Means</HI> (directly or immediately) that therefore a <HI>temporal Kingdom</HI> cannot, or &s;hould not be pro|moted, or pre&s;erved by them, under God, which are of the &s;ame Kind with it, and &s;uited to it! This is ju&s;t, in other Words, to &s;ay, Becau&s;e that un&s;uit|able Means will not an&s;wer the End, therefore &s;uit|able
<PB N="77" REF="006247_0081_102820F369F0D100">
will not! According to the afore&s;aid plain <HI>Con|ce&s;&s;ion</HI> of our Lord, the <HI>Subjects</HI> of a <HI>temporal King</HI> may, and ought to fight, in the Defence of their <HI>King,</HI> their <HI>Country,</HI> and <HI>civil Privileges;</HI> and that for this <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> becau&s;e that <HI>Mean</HI> is &s;uited to the <HI>End.</HI></P>
<P>But to open this Matter a little more, let it be ob|&s;erved, that there are two notable <HI>Societies</HI> among Men, namely, <HI>Civil</HI> and <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tical;</HI> which, tho' they appear mixed and confu&s;ed, becau&s;e the &s;ame Per&s;ons are frequently Members of both, are not|with&s;tanding di&s;tinct and different from each other; they tend to different <HI>Ends</HI> by different <HI>Means,</HI> and have re&s;pectively different <HI>Kinds</HI> of <HI>Power.</HI> The <HI>End</HI> of eccle&s;ia&s;tical or religious <HI>Society,</HI> is everla&s;t|ing <HI>Happine&s;s;</HI> but the End of civil <HI>Society,</HI> is the Peace and Safety of the <HI>State:</HI> The&s;e <HI>Ends</HI> being very different, it is no Wonder if the <HI>Means</HI> condu|cing to them be &s;o likewi&s;e. To eternal Happine&s;s none can come, except by an uncon&s;trained and &s;in|cere Obedience to the divine Precepts, i&s;&s;uing from Faith and Love, which it is the great Bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Religion</HI> to promote: But, on the other hand, it is no Matter to the <HI>State,</HI> whether its <HI>Laws</HI> are o|bey'd <HI>freely</HI> or not; if they be but <HI>obey'd</HI> outwardly, it is enough; this <HI>Obedience</HI> it is their proper <HI>Bu&s;i|ne&s;s</HI> to procure, which may be effected by the <HI>Fear</HI> of <HI>Puni&s;hment</HI> and <HI>Death.</HI> In &s;hort, the <HI>Power</HI> of the <HI>State</HI> extends to Mens <HI>Bodies,</HI> but that of the <HI>Church</HI> re&s;pects the Soul: The former may, and therefore ought to be compelled to <HI>Obedience,</HI> thro' a Dread of Puni&s;hment and Death; but the latter cannot be forced by outward <HI>Violence;</HI> and therefore the <HI>Church</HI> can have no Power over it, nor reclaim Delinquents any other Way, but by <HI>Reproof, Coun&s;el, Entreaty,</HI> and in ca&s;e of per&s;evering <HI>Ob&s;tinacy,</HI> de|clare them unworthy of their <HI>Communion.</HI> The <HI>Laws</HI>

of civil <HI>Society</HI> re&s;pect the <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Good</HI> of the <HI>Commonwealth;</HI> but the <HI>Canons</HI> of Churches are de|&s;igned to promote and pre&s;erve <HI>Purity</HI> of <HI>Doctrine,</HI> and <HI>Piety</HI> of <HI>Di&s;cipline.</HI> From the&s;e <HI>Principles</HI> it ea&s;ily and clearly follows, that the <HI>Power</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> is only &s;piritual, and the <HI>Power</HI> of the <HI>State</HI> only temporal.</P>

<P>An&s;wer, No! I offered no &s;uch Argument, and therefore his Query is impertinent, but &s;eems artful, and calculated to turn my <HI>Argument</HI> out of its pro|per <HI>Channel.</HI></P>

<P>Whether he continued in his <HI>Office</HI> or not, is of little Con&s;equence to this Argument, becau&s;e that is a Matter of <HI>Fact</HI> of an imperfect Creature; but it is concerning <HI>Right</HI> we are to enquire, namely, whe|ther he cou'd, con&s;i&s;tent with <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> continue in that <HI>Office!</HI> If his <HI>Office</HI> was <HI>&s;inful,</HI> it was <HI>Peter</HI>'s <HI>Duty</HI> to in&s;truct him better, and more e&s;pecially, &s;eeing he came to vi&s;it him upon that De&s;ign; but not a Word of this, tho' that Apo&s;tle was free e|nough to &s;peak his Mind upon other Occa&s;ions.</P>

<P>In the mean time, I am credibly informed, that the good Under&s;tanding which this Province has had, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> has been only with the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> with which the other <HI>American</HI> Colonies have had Peace likewi&s;e; &s;o that there is nothing extraordina|ry in the Matter.</P>
<P>Not to &s;ay that the afore&s;aid good Under&s;tanding has been doubtle&s;s maintained by the U&s;e of out|ward Means, &s;uch as <HI>Treaties,</HI> and repeated Dona|tions: But now I am told that the <HI>State</HI> of our Af|fairs with &s;ome of the <HI>Indian Tribes</HI> is <HI>dark</HI> and <HI>du|bious,</HI>

<P>But tho' the Practice of <HI>Humility, Meekne&s;s, Benefi|cence,</HI> &amp;c. are very good to continue <HI>Peace</HI> where it is; what &s;hall be done to procure it where it is lo&s;t, if <HI>Defen&s;ive War</HI> be denied?

<P>But our <HI>Author</HI> proceeds to enquire, <HI>V. p.</HI> 33. <Q>Is it not more con&s;i&s;tent with the <HI>Duty</HI> of a <HI>Mini|&s;ter</HI> of the Meek, Self-denying <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> to recommend Piety and Prayers, as the only acceptable <HI>Means</HI> ne|ce&s;&s;ary to obtain the Protection of <HI>Heaven?</HI></Q></P>
<P>I an&s;wer in the Negative, No! a Mini&s;ter of <HI>Je|&s;us</HI> &s;hould tell the Truth, and <HI>deliver the whole Coun|cil of God.</HI> A <HI>Watchman, when he &s;ees the Sword coming upon a Land, &s;hould blow the Trumpet, and warn the People, otherwi&s;e their Blood will be requi|red at his Hand!</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>S.</HI> proceeds next to con&s;ider what I have &s;aid upon the Prophecy of <HI>I&s;aiah,</HI> ii. 4. upon which he &s;pends &s;everal Pages, <HI>V.</HI> 33, 34, 35, 36, 37. He cen&s;ures my Interpretation of the Prophecy, and thinks it was de&s;igned to &s;ignify an utter Exclu&s;ion of all <HI>War</HI> of every Kind; and therefore concludes it &s;inful for pious People to be concerned in <HI>War</HI> at all; this I take to be the Sub&s;tance of what he has &s;aid. I have in the Sermon a&s;&s;erted, that the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> inclines all that receive it in Truth, <HI>to live as much as is po&s;&s;ible in Peace with all Men:</HI> That it is at|tended with an <HI>internal Peace,</HI> and that probably there will be a <HI>Time,</HI> before the End of the World, when the Power of <HI>Religion</HI> &s;hall prevail more ge|nerally

than at pre&s;ent, and outward Peace flouri&s;h, as the Con&s;equent of it. <HI>See S. p.</HI> 26, 27.</P>
<P>The Difference then between us lies in this &s;ingle Point, of the Lawfulne&s;s of u&s;ing <HI>Defen&s;ive War,</HI> till that Time comes when there will be no Occa&s;ion for it; I a&s;&s;ert this, and he denies it; let me there|fore examine the Grounds of his <HI>Negative.</HI> And,</P>
<P N="1">1. <Q>The <HI>Cau&s;e,</HI> &s;aith our Author, is the judging of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> internally in Individuals, and the <HI>Effect,</HI> that wherever this judging is experienced, there is &s;uch a Ce&s;&s;ation from all War, <HI>A good Tree bring|eth not forth corrupt Fruit,</HI> Luke vi. 43. But <HI>War</HI> is a corrupt Fruit, becau&s;e it hath Lu&s;t for its Original.</Q></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Very true, <HI>Offen&s;ive War</HI> is &s;o; and there|fore tho&s;e that are pious will not bring forth &s;uch Fruit; as our Author well ob&s;erves; No! but op|po&s;e it; and this, methinks, &s;hould be in <HI>Works,</HI> as well as in <HI>Words.</HI> I am &s;o far from a De&s;ire of le&s;|&s;ening our Author's <HI>Oppo&s;ition</HI> to <HI>&s;inful War,</HI> name|ly, <HI>Offen&s;ive,</HI> that I heartily wi&s;h it was much <HI>&s;trong|er,</HI> and that he might get &s;uch Light, as to concur with others in Preparation to cru&s;h that <HI>Cockatrice,</HI> under God, by main <HI>Force,</HI> if milder Mea&s;ures will not do, which we &s;hould be glad they would, and &s;o prevent the Nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>&s;hedding human Blood;</HI> this is a Di&s;po&s;ition truly &s;ublime, as he ju&s;tly ob|&s;erves!</P>
<P N="2">2. Our <HI>Author</HI> offers the <HI>Jewi&s;h Objection</HI> again&s;t my <HI>Opinion, V. p.</HI> 35. which he is plea&s;ed to intro|duce with an Air of <HI>Di&s;dain;</HI> how will our <HI>mighty Pleader</HI> for <HI>War</HI> an&s;wer this Objection? Mr. <HI>S.</HI> has to Appearance u&s;ed &s;lighting <HI>Terms</HI> in &s;everal Parts of his Performance, this <HI>Sermon-writer,</HI> &amp;c. not con&s;idering, perhaps, that he is guilty likewi&s;e of that <HI>awful Crime</HI> as well as me, &s;ince he has enter'd into an <HI>Offen&s;ive War</HI> again&s;t me; and in this Place, by

the Figure <HI>Antiphra&s;is,</HI> he repre&s;ents me as very weak!</P>
<P>Well, I own the <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> of his <HI>Charge,</HI> and there|fore any <HI>Defects</HI> that may attend this <HI>E&s;&s;ay,</HI> are to be a&s;cribed thereto; and if there be any thing of a different <HI>Kind,</HI> it is to be a&s;cribed to the Kindne&s;s of a gracious <HI>God,</HI> and the goodne&s;s of my <HI>Cau&s;e,</HI> that have helped a <HI>weak In&s;trument!</HI></P>
<P>In the mean time, as to the <HI>Jewi&s;h Objection,</HI> &s;o far as I can &s;ee, his Opinion does not in the lea&s;t weaken it, for as much as the Prophecy re&s;pects a <HI>national Peace,</HI> which does not obtain; and therefore what becomes of the <HI>Truth</HI> of the <HI>Prophecy,</HI> if it certainly intends an external as well as internal Peace, as an immediate Con&s;equent of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI>'s coming?</P>
<P N="3">3. Our <HI>Author</HI> finds Fault, <HI>V. p.</HI> 35. with my &s;aying that the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> &s;ubdues Mens Corruptions in a <HI>Mea&s;ure;</HI> he would have had me to have omitted the&s;e Words, in a <HI>Mea&s;ure;</HI> but I a&s;&s;ure him, that I don't know how to leave them out, nor does he do &s;o, as to him&s;elf, in his <HI>Preface.</HI></P>
<P><Q>For Humility and Meekne&s;s, &s;aith he, are quite oppo&s;ite to <HI>War</HI> and <HI>Fighting,</HI> which pro|ceed from Pride and Covetou&s;ne&s;s.</Q></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> Very ju&s;t, and therefore we ought to &s;up|pre&s;s in others, that Mon&s;ter, <HI>Offen&s;ive War;</HI> on|ly our <HI>Author,</HI> as I conceive, doesn't oppo&s;e e|nough in <HI>Degree;</HI> there &s;eems to be his great <HI>De|fect.</HI>'</P>
<P>But our <HI>Author</HI> is plea&s;ed to query, Does not the Intimation, that the <HI>Go&s;pel received in the Love of it,</HI> only in a <HI>Mea&s;ure</HI> &s;ubdues Mens Corruptions, <HI>imply a Deficiency in the Power?</HI> And can it be con&s;i&s;tent with our Lord's Doctrine, <HI>Except a Man be born again, he cannot &s;ee the Kingdom of God?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> To the former Que&s;tion, No! I'll make bold to take him&s;elf for an In&s;tance. In his <HI>Pre|face</HI>
<PB N="93" REF="006247_0097_1028212D44C79E18">
he acknowledges <HI>that he has not yet attained, nor is already perfect:</HI> I am apt to think our Author &s;peaks the <HI>Truth</HI> here, and that his pre&s;ent <HI>Perfor|mance</HI> is a Proof thereof. Now, one of the&s;e two Things follows from the&s;e two Pa&s;&s;ages of our <HI>Au|thor;</HI> either that he has not received the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> in the <HI>Love</HI> of it; or that his Imperfection argues no Deficiency of Power in <HI>God</HI> or his <HI>Go&s;pel.</HI></P>
<P>No! the Wi&s;dom of <HI>God</HI> appears in &s;uffering our pre&s;ent State to be attended with <HI>Defects;</HI> hereby con&s;tant Occa&s;ion is given for Self-aba&s;ement, prizing of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and continual <HI>Dependence</HI> upon him, as well as longing for that Time and Place, when and where <HI>that</HI> WHICH IS PERFECT SHALL COME, <HI>and that which is in Part, &s;hall be done away.</HI></P>
<P>Bringing in <HI>Poole</HI>'s Annotations, to patronize the Doctrine of <HI>Perfection,</HI> is no Argument that our Author has attain'd it him&s;elf; for it is an <HI>Attempt</HI> to make him &s;peak contrary to his real <HI>Sentiments</HI>
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>See his Annotations upon 1 <HI>John</HI> xviii. <HI>If we &s;ay that we have no Sin, we deceive our&s;elves, and the Truth is not in us.</HI>

<P>Give me leave to offer a Word to our Author, by Way of Query, re&s;pecting divers uncharitable Sentences in his <HI>Vindication,</HI> SOME of which I have mentioned in this <HI>Reply.</HI></P>
<P>Pray, <HI>Sir,</HI> Isn't judging the <HI>States</HI> of others, on Account of a &s;uppos'd or real <HI>Mi&s;take</HI> in <HI>Principle,</HI> re&s;pecting Things not <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> to <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Sal|vation,</HI> contrary to the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI>'s <HI>Chain</HI> of Rea&s;on|ings, in the 14th Chapter of his <HI>Epi&s;tle</HI> to the <HI>Ro|mans;</HI> and in very Deed, a <HI>Degree</HI> of real <HI>Per&s;ecu|tion</HI> for <HI>Religion?</HI> And does this <HI>Per&s;ecution</HI> con&s;i&s;t well with <HI>pa&s;&s;ive Principles?</HI></P>
<P>And &s;eeing that va&s;tly the greater Part of the Chri&s;tian <HI>World</HI> are for <HI>Defen&s;ive War,</HI> and many of them live &s;ober and regular Lives, and are ac|quainted with experimental <HI>Religion,</HI> and con&s;ider|ing that they have herein the Concurrence of all the Re&s;t of <HI>Mankind,</HI> does it look &s;o decent and hum|ble like as cou'd be wi&s;hed, to treat them with an Appearance of <HI>Slight,</HI> and to condemn their <HI>States?</HI></P>
<P>It is no Doubt a great Duty to depend on divine <HI>Providence,</HI> in the regular U&s;e of all appointed Means; but if we may, without <HI>Pre&s;umption</HI> and Impunity, depend in the Neglect of one Mean,

may we not, by a Parity of Rea&s;on, in the Neglect of more, and con&s;equently of all, and thus become intirely unactive, when we come to the <HI>Perfection</HI> of <HI>Virtue;</HI> a &s;trange Sort of Perfection indeed, a Per|fection of <HI>Sloth</HI> and Indolence!</P>
<P>But before I conclude this <HI>Reply,</HI> I think it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to con&s;ider tho&s;e <HI>In&s;tances</HI> which our <HI>Author</HI> has brought from <HI>Antiquity,</HI> for the Confirmation of his <HI>Opinion,</HI> and that with a &s;ufficient Degree of <HI>Confidence,</HI> that the <HI>primitive Church</HI> was upon his Side of the Que&s;tion.</P>
<P>Before I enter upon this Point, I would ob&s;erve, that I had not meddled with the <HI>Fathers,</HI> in the <HI>Sermon</HI> he is plea&s;ed to animadvert upon, as be|lieving that the <HI>Merit</HI> of the <HI>Cau&s;e</HI> in Controver&s;y, does not depend upon their <HI>Te&s;timony,</HI> but upon the Suffrage of <HI>Scripture</HI> and <HI>Rea&s;on:</HI> They were fal|lible Men as well as others, and had no other <HI>Rule</HI> to direct their Sentiments and Conduct, but what we have; no <HI>Antiquity,</HI> or human <HI>Authority,</HI> can alter the Nature and Rea&s;on of Things; or ju&s;tly commend to our E&s;teem and Acceptance, what is erroneus or ab&s;urd!</P>
<P>I have not mentioned the&s;e Things from any Diffidence re&s;pecting the <HI>Fathers,</HI> as tho' they were not for <HI>Defen&s;ive War,</HI> No! But to fix the <HI>Stre&s;s</HI> of the <HI>Controver&s;y</HI> upon its proper <HI>Ba&s;is.</HI></P>
<P>At the Beginning of the <HI>Reformation</HI> (if I remem|ber right) in the <HI>Di&s;putes</HI> between the <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> and <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> the latter often urged, that the <HI>Fathers,</HI> together with the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> &s;hou'd be appeal'd to as determining <HI>Judges</HI> thereof, but the former ju&s;t|ly rejected the Propo&s;al.</P>
<P>After &s;ome Enquiry, I cannot yet find, that our <HI>Author</HI> had any Ground of <HI>Triumph,</HI> in Re&s;pect of the <HI>Fathers:</HI> However, after having offered my Rea&s;ons, I freely leave this Point to the Judgment of

<P>Having premi&s;ed &s;uch Con&s;iderations as I tho't nece&s;&s;ary, to enlighten the labouring Subject; I proceed to con&s;ider the particular In&s;tances, that our Author has adduced in Favour of his Senti|ments. The</P>

<P>I An&s;wer, that what <HI>Socrates</HI> &s;ays, is very ju&s;t and true: Private <HI>Revenge</HI> in <HI>Society,</HI> in ordinary Ca&s;es, or repelling Force by Force, is irregular and unju&s;t, as I have before ob&s;erved; and therefore this In&s;tance is quite be&s;ide the Point in Di&s;pute.</P>
<P>Isn't it &s;omething &s;trange, that our Author &s;hou'd bring in a Sentence of that eminent <HI>Pagan,</HI> to condemn his known <HI>Practice;</HI> and u&s;e the Gen|tleman's <HI>Magazine</HI> as his Voucher to this Pur|po&s;e. The</P>

<P N="3">3.

<P N="4">4th In&s;tance that our <HI>Author</HI> advances, is that of <HI>Athenagoras, V. p.</HI> 42, 43. who in his <HI>Apology</HI> to the <HI>Roman Emperors, M. Aurelius Antoninus,</HI> and <HI>M. Aurelius Commodus,</HI> declares,
<Q>That they made the&s;e Words of our Saviour their <HI>Rules</HI> and <HI>Dog|ma</HI>'s, namely. <HI>To love their Enemies, ble&s;s them that cur&s;e you, pray for them that per&s;ecute you, &amp;c.</HI> Agreeable hereto he ob&s;erves, That the Chri&s;tians of that Day, lov'd their Neighbours, and exercis'd Innocence and Purity of Life, a&s;&s;u|ring them, that they cou'd &s;uffer no Evil of their Per&s;ecutors, tho' it were to the Lo&s;s of their Lives, which cou'd be of any Value, when com|par'd to that exceeding great Reward, which God wou'd give them hereafter.</Q></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> This Speech of <HI>Athenagoras,</HI> is very &s;ound and whole&s;ome, and perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with our defen&s;ive Principles.

<P><HI>Query</HI> 1. Is it then the chief Force of Chri&s;t's <HI>Precepts</HI> to ab&s;tain from <HI>Defen&s;ive War?</HI> But where are the&s;e Precepts to be found?</P>
<P><HI>Query</HI> 2. Where is the <HI>Self-denial</HI> and <HI>Cro&s;s</HI> in be|ing freed from the <HI>Labour</HI> and <HI>Expence</HI> of preparing for the Defence of our Country?</P>
<P><HI>Query</HI> 3. If the Chief Force of Chri&s;t's <HI>Precepts,</HI> the chief Weight of his <HI>Cro&s;s,</HI> and of <HI>Self-denial,</HI> con&s;i&s;t in being freed as afore&s;aid from <HI>Charge</HI> and <HI>Fatigue;</HI> then are not the Difficulties of Religion as light as a <HI>Feather,</HI> and very agreeable to the corrupt Inclinations of Nature, which verge to <HI>Money</HI> and <HI>Ea&s;e?</HI></P>
<P>In the mean Time, we heartily forgive our Au|thor's <HI>Invective,</HI> and pray God to pardon his <HI>Uncha|ritablene&s;s</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ecution,</HI> and ble&s;s him with a found Mind, and all other needful Mercies, for Time and Eternity.</P>
<P>Now ina&s;much as the afore&s;aid In&s;tance of <HI>Athe|nagoras,</HI> expre&s;ly re&s;pects <HI>Per&s;ecution,</HI> it is quite be|&s;ide the Point in Que&s;tion, and therefore de&s;erves no more Notice; however, I &s;hall beg leave to add a few Words.</P>
<P><Q>He complains, &s;ays Mon&s;ieur <HI>Fleury,</HI> to the two <HI>Emperors, Marcus Aurelius,</HI> and <HI>Lucius Ve|rus,</HI> that the Chri&s;tians are the only People whom they <HI>per&s;ecute,</HI> on Account of their <HI>Name,</HI> whil&s;t all others are permitted to live according to their <HI>Laws</HI> and <HI>Religion.</HI></Q> <Q>Our <HI>Per&s;ecutors,</HI> &s;aith he, are not contented with depriving us of our Goods and Honour, and whatever el&s;e the Generality of Mankind look upon as valuable, for we de&s;pi&s;e it all&mdash;But they attack our <HI>Per&s;ons</HI> and our <HI>Lives;</HI> &mdash;It depends upon you, mo&s;t great and wi&s;e <HI>Prin|ces,</HI> to defend us by the <HI>Laws</HI> <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Vid.

<P><HI>Query</HI> 3. Whether <HI>Uncharitablene&s;s</HI> be a good

Sign of a <HI>peaceable Temper,</HI> and of great Attain|ments in Spirituality?</P>
<P><HI>Query</HI> 4. Was it not a <HI>Blot</HI> in <HI>Tertullian</HI>'s <HI>E&s;|cutcheon,</HI> that when he fell into the <HI>Errors</HI> of <HI>Monta|nus,</HI> he had no Charity for any but his enthu&s;ia&s;tical Followers; and therefore wrote again&s;t the Catho|lick Church, under the Character of natural or gracele&s;s Per&s;ons?</P>
<P>I mu&s;t freely declare, that upon a farther <HI>Inquiry</HI> into the <HI>Subject</HI> of this <HI>Debate,</HI> occa&s;ion'd by Mr. <HI>Smith</HI>'s Annimadver&s;ions, I am more confirm'd in my <HI>Opinion</HI> than before; and cannot find any Thing in <HI>Scripture, Rea&s;on,</HI> or <HI>Antiquity,</HI> to coun|tenance the contrary.</P>
<P>It is true divers <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> of a private <HI>Character</HI> declin'd <HI>War</HI> in the primitive Times; but this is no Wonder at all, con&s;idering the <HI>idolatrous Terms</HI> im|pos'd upon <HI>Soldiers</HI> by the Pagan <HI>Emperors;</HI> nor is it any Prejudice in the lea&s;t Degree to the Cau&s;e I defend.</P>
<P>Yet I know of none of any Note in the Chri&s;tian Church, for the Space of Fifteen Hundred Years after <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> that was of our <HI>Author</HI>'s <HI>Opinion, viz.</HI> That <HI>War</HI> of every Kind is in it&s;elf a great <HI>Evil;</HI> yea, as much greater than private <HI>Revenge,</HI> as a <HI>Camel</HI> is to a <HI>Gnat.</HI> See <HI>V. p.</HI> 39, 40. and el&s;e|where.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;ing &s;ome few might be found, of a &s;ingular and whim&s;ical <HI>Ca&s;t</HI> of <HI>Mind,</HI> and perhaps <HI>Self-contradictory,</HI> who were of our <HI>Author</HI>'s <HI>Opini|on;</HI> can the&s;e turn the <HI>Stream</HI> of <HI>Antiquity</HI> retro|grade, or di&s;annul the <HI>Judgment</HI> of the <HI>Body</HI> of the Chri&s;tian <HI>Church?</HI> No, by no Means!</P>
<P>And now to u&s;e Mr. <HI>Smith</HI>'s Words, may I not &s;ay, that I have gone thro' the Arguments us'd in his <HI>Vindication,</HI> to prove the <HI>Unlawfulne&s;s</HI> of <HI>War?</HI>
