<HEAD>A RECOMMENDATION, By the Reverend Mr. MICHAEL BOSTON, The Author's Grand&s;on:</HEAD>
<P>HUMAN NATURE in its FOURFOLD STATE, was the fir&s;t production of my venerable An|ce&s;tor, introduced to the Public. It made its fir&s;t appearance in the year 1720. Since that period, it has undergone at an average, One complete Edition every two years. Twenty thou&s;and Copies of it have been exported to America, from one &s;ingle City in Scotland, be&s;ides tho&s;e that have been &s;ent to the Continent from England and Ireland. The rapid &s;ale of the Book upon its fir&s;t Publica|tion, is a demon&s;trative proof of the e&s;teem in which it was then held: and the uninterrupted demand for it &s;till, &s;hows that the Principles it inculcates, are yet held in repute. All that I need further to add, is, That the pre&s;ent Edition is printed from that one Revi&s;ed and Corrected by the Author him|&s;elf, and may therefore be e&s;teemed correct.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IT is a maxim among wi&s;e men, That the knowledge of per&s;ons is of as great u&s;e in the conduct of human life, as the knowledge of things: and it is mo&s;t certain, that he who knows the various tempers, humours, and di&s;po&s;itions of men, who can find out their turn of thought, and penetrate into the &s;ecret &s;prings and principles of their actings, will not be at a lo&s;s to find out proper means for compa&s;&s;ing his aims, will ea&s;ily pre&s;erve him&s;elf from &s;nares, and either evite or overcome difficulties. But the knowledge of human nature, morally con&s;idered, or, in other words of the temper and di&s;po&s;ition of the &s;oul in its moral powers, is of much greater value; as it is of u&s;e in the concerns of an unchangeable life and world: he who is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;o valuable a branch of knowledge, is thereby cap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ated to judge aright of him&s;elf, to under&s;tand true Chri&s;tianity, and to conceive ju&s;tly of perfect happine&s;s, and con&s;ummate mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>The depravity of human nature is &s;o plainly taught, yea inculcated in &s;acred Scripture, and is &s;o obvious to every thinking man's ob&s;er|vation, who &s;earches his own brea&s;t, and reflects duly on his temper and actings, that it is &s;urprizingly &s;trange and wonderful&punc; how it comes to pa&s;s, that this important truth is &s;o little under&s;tood&punc; yea &s;o much di&s;believed, by men who bear the name of go&s;pel Mini&s;ters Are there not per&s;ons to be found in a neighbouring nation, in the cha|racter of preachers, appearing daily in pulpits, who are &s;o unacquanted with their Bibles and them&s;elves, that they ridicule the doctrine of original &s;in as unintelligible jargon? If they are per&s;ons of a moral life and conver&s;ation, they &s;eem to imagine, they cannot become better than they are; if they are immoral. they &s;eem to indulge a conceit, that they can become virtuous, yea religious, when they plea&s;e. The&s;e are the men who talk of the dignity of human nature, of greatne&s;s of mind, noblene&s;s of &s;oul, and genero&s;ity of &s;pirit: as if they intended to per&s;uade them&s;elves and others, that pride is a good principle, and do not know, that pride and &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s are the bane of mankind, pro|ductive of all the wickedne&s;s, and much of the mi&s;ery to be found in this and in the other world; and is indeed that, wherein the depra|vity of human nature properly con&s;i&s;ts.</P>
<P>Upright <HI>Adam's</HI> nature faintly adumbrated the divine, in a mode|rate s;elf-e&s;teem, in an adequate &s;elf-love and delightful reflexion on his own borrowed excellency, regulated by a ju&s;t e&s;teem of, and &s;upreme love to his adored Creator: whence a peaceful &s;erenity of mind, a loving, compa&s;&s;ionate and benevolent di&s;po&s;ition of &s;oul, a depth of thought and brightne&s;s of imagination, delightfully employed in the rapturous contemplation of his beloved Maker's infinite perfections thus bearing the divine image, and re&s;embling GOD that made him&punc; But no &s;ooner did he di&s;obey the divine probatory command, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">les were ca&s;t, his moderate &s;elf-e&s;teem degenerated into pride, his adequate &s;elf-love &s;hrunk into mere &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, and his delightful reflections on his own excellency, varied into the trickling plea&s;ures of vanity and conceit: he lo&s;t view of the Author of his being<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and thenceforth, in&s;tead of delighting in him, fir&s;t dreaded, and then de&s;|pi&s;ed him.</P>
<P>The mode&s;t, and therefore hitherto anonymous author of the fol|lowing di&s;cour&s;es, Mr. <HI>Thomas Bo&s;ton,</HI> having handled this &s;ubject, in preaching to his own ob&s;cure parochial congregation of Etterick, in the &s;heriffdom of <HI>Selkirk,</HI> had a particular view to their benefit&punc; in printing and publi&s;hing them; and therefore the &s;tile and method is plain and &s;imple, and the fir&s;t edition printed on coar&s;e paper; but the &s;ubject is &s;o comprehen&s;ive and important, &s;o well managed, and the book has been &s;o well received, that it now appears in the world more embelli&s;hed as well as better corrected than formerly.</P>
<P>Let it &s;uffice to recommend it to tho&s;e who have a right ta&s;te of genuine Chri&s;tianity, that all the Author's notions flow &s;o directly from the &s;acred fountain, that it is to be doubted, if he has had much recour&s;e to any other help that his Bible and his GOD for a&s;&s;i&s;tance: Mean time, I am aware of an exception from the&s;e who rank them|&s;elves among the polite part of mankind, as that there is the &s;ame har&s;h peculiarity of dialect in it, which is commonly to be found in books of practical divinity. But I beg leave to ob&s;erve, That the dia|lect they except again&s;t, is borrowed from &s;acred &s;cripture; and like|-as <HI>it has plea&s;ed</HI> GOD, <HI>by the fooli&s;hne&s;s of preaching, to &s;ave them that believe;</HI> &s;o al&s;o to countenance what they are di&s;plea&s;ed with, by the opperations of his Spirit on the minds of true Chri&s;tians as their com|mon experience witne&s;&s;eth. However, I heartily wi&s;h, the exception were altogether removed, by &s;ome per&s;ons dige&s;ting into a methodical treati&s;e, the views of human nature in its primitive perfection, in its depraved condition, and in its retrieved &s;tate, who is ma&s;ter of modern &s;tile, and throughly under&s;tands the &s;ubjects di&s;cour&s;ed in this book, that by becoming all things to all men, Some, <HI>viz.</HI> Of all ranks and kinds of men, may be gained.</P>
<P>I am not declaim at large in favours of religion; this were to write a book by way of preface. Many able pens have been employed in recommending it to the world, by &s;trong arguments drawn from its u&s;efulne&s;s to &s;ociety, its &s;uitablene&s;s to the dignity of the rational na|ture, and the advantages ari&s;ing to men from it in this and the other world. But, after all, may not one be allowed to doubt, if religion be rightly under&s;tood by all its patrons? may not the beauties and excellencies of a precious gem be elegantly de&s;cribed by a naturali&s;t, or jeweller, who never &s;aw the particular one he talked of, and knows little of its nature, le&s;s of the con&s;truction of its parts, and nothing of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> proper u&s;e? Are there not men of bright parts, who rea&s;on finely in defence of religion, and yet are &s;o much &s;trangers to it, that they brand the per&s;ons who are &s;o happy as to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of
<PB N="vii" REF="045042_0005_101F7C70F275A9E0">
it, with the hard name of &s;pirituali&s;ts, reckoning them a kind of <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;ts,</HI> unworthy of their regard. The truth is, Chri&s;tianity is a my&s;tery, mere rea&s;on does not comprehend it There is a &s;piritual di&s;cerning nece&s;&s;ary to its being rightly under&s;tood&punc; whence it comes to pa&s;s that men of great learning and abilities, tho' they read the Scriptures with attention, and comment learnedly upon them; yet do not, yea cannot, enter into the vein of thought peculiar to the in&s;pired penman, becau&s;e they &s;hare not of the &s;ame Spirit: wherefore it is, that the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> a&s;&s;erts, the natural, that is, unregenerate man, not to <HI>know the things of God, neither indeed to be capable of knowing them, becau&s;e they are &s;piritually di&s;cerned.</HI></P>
<P>From what has been &s;aid, it is ea&s;y to conclude. That no pedantic apology on the part of the Author, for appearing in print, or fawning compliments to the courteous reader, on the part of the prefacer, are to be expected The truth is, both the one and the other are rather little arts, vailing pedantry and conceit, than evidences of mode&s;ty and good-&s;en&s;e. It is of more u&s;e to recommend the peru&s;al of the book to per&s;ons of all ranks and degrees, from a few &s;uitable topicks, than to &s;hew wherein this Edition differs from the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>That all mankind, however differenced by their rank and &s;tation in the world, have an equal concern in what is revealed concerning an|other and future world, will be readily owned; and it mu&s;t be as readily granted, that however allowable it may be for men of learn|ing and parts, to plea&s;e them&s;elves with finene&s;s of language, fullne&s;s of thought, and exact connection in writings upon other &s;ubjects; yet they ought not to indulge them&s;elves in the &s;ame ta&s;te in di&s;cour&s;es on divine things, le&s;t they expo&s;e them&s;elves to the ju&s;t cen&s;ure of acting with the &s;ame indi&s;cretion, as a per&s;on in danger of fami&s;hing by hun|ger, would be guilty of, if he perver&s;ly rejected plain whol&s;ome food, when offered to him, for no other rea&s;on than the want of palatable &s;auce, or order and &s;plendor in &s;erving it up.</P>
<P>The &s;acred book we call the Bible, has a peculiar &s;ublimity in it, vailed with unu&s;ual dialect and &s;eeming inconnection: but it is not therefore to be rejected by men who bear the name of Chri&s;tians, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> uncouth or unintelligible; true wi&s;dom dictates quite another thing, it coun&s;els us, by frequent reading, to acquaint our&s;elves well with it, become accu&s;tomed to its peculiar phra&s;es, and &s;earch into its &s;ubli|mities: upon this ground, that the matters contained in it, are of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence to us, and when rightly under&s;tood, yield a refined delight, much &s;uperior to what is to be found in reading the be&s;t writ|ten books on the mo&s;t entertaining &s;ubjects. What pleads for the parent is a plea for the progeny; practical di&s;cour&s;es upon divine &s;ub|jects are the genuine offspring of the &s;acred text, and ought therefore to be read carefully and with attention, by per&s;ons of all ranks and degrees, though they are indeed calculated for, and peculiarly adapted to &s;uch as move in low &s;pheres of life.</P>
<P>Let it, however, be a prevailing argument with per&s;ons of all de|nominations,
<PB N="viii" REF="045042_0006_101F7C740425D038">
carefully to read books of practical divinity, That many of them are not written on the &s;ame motives and principles as other books are; the authors have often a peculiar divine call to publi&s;h them, and well founded hope of their being u&s;eful to advance Chri&s;tianity in the world In con&s;equence whereof it is, that great numbers have reaped benefit by reading them, e&s;pecially in childhood and youth; many have been converted by them; and it may be que&s;tioned, if ever there was a true Chri&s;tian, &s;ince the art of printing made the&s;e books common, who has not, in &s;ome &s;tage of life, reaped con&s;iderable ad|vantage from them. This book recommends it&s;elf in a particular man|ner, by its being a &s;hort &s;ub&s;tantial &s;y&s;tem of practical divinity, in &s;o much, that it may with truth be a&s;&s;erted, That a per&s;on who is throughly acquainted with all that is here taught, may, without dan|ger to his eternal intere&s;t, remain ignorant of other things, which pertain to the &s;cience called divinity. It is therefore earne&s;tly recom|mended to the &s;erious and frequent peru&s;al of all, but e&s;pecially of &s;uch as are in that &s;tage of life called youth, and are &s;o &s;tationed in the world, as not to be frequently opportuned to hear &s;ermons, and read comm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">taries on the &s;acred text.</P>
<P>It is doubtle&s;s incumbent on ma&s;ters of families to make &s;ome pro|vi&s;ion of &s;piritual as well as bodily food, for their children and &s;ervants; this is effectually done by putting practical books in their hands: and therefore this book is humbly and earne&s;tly recommended as a family|-book, which all the members of it are not only allowed, but de&s;ired to peru&s;e.</P>
<P>As to the difference betwixt this and the former edition, which gives it preference, it lies chiefly in the Author's not only having revi&s;ed the &s;tile, but the thought in many places, and corrected both, &s;o as to &s;et &s;everal important truths in a clearer light, and make the &s;tile of the book now uniform, which formerly was not &s;o, becau&s;e of the expli|cations of peculiar words and phra&s;es in u&s;e among&s;t practical divines, e&s;pecially of the church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which were inter&s;per&s;ed through|out the former edition, and introduced by another hand, for the &s;ake of &s;uch per&s;ons as are not accu&s;tomed to them. It remains, that the pre|facer not only &s;ubjoin his name, which was concealed in the fir&s;t edi|tion, as a te&s;timony that he e&s;teems the Author, and values the book, but that he may thereby recommend it in a particular manner to the peru&s;al of per&s;ons of his own acquaintance If in his a&s;&s;i&s;ting towards its being publi&s;hed, and in prefacing both editions, he has not run un|feat, he has what will bear him up under all cen&s;ures; the charitable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">till thank no evil, and others will do as they plea&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>STATE I. NAMELY, The State of INNOCENCE, or Primitive Integrity, in which Man was created.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>ECCLES. vii. 29.</BIBL>
<P>Lo! this only have I found, That GOD hath made Man upright: But they have &s;ought out many Inventions.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THERE are four things very nece&s;&s;ary to be known by all that would &s;ee Heaven: <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> What Man was in the &s;tate of innocence, as GOD made him. <HI>Secondly,</HI> What he is in the &s;tate of corrupt nature, as he hath unmade him&s;elf. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> What he mu&s;t be in the &s;tate of grace, as created in Chri&s;t Je&s;us unto good works, if ever he be made a partaker of the inheritance of the &s;aints in light And, <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> What he &s;hall be in his eternal &s;tate, as made by the Judge of all, either perfectly happy, or compleatly mi&s;erable, and that forever. The&s;e are weighty points, that touch the vitals of practical godline&s;s, from which mo&s;t men, and even many pro|fe&s;&s;ors, in the&s;e dregs of time, are quite e&s;tranged. I de&s;ign therefore, under the divine conduct, to open up the&s;e things, and apply them.</P>
<P>I begin with the fir&s;t of them, namely, The &s;tate of Innocence: that beholding man poli&s;hed after the &s;imilitude of a palace&punc; the ruins <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the more affect us; we may the more prize that matchle&s;s Per&s;on, whom the Father has appointed the repairer of the breach; and that we may, with fixed re&s;olves, betake our&s;elves to that way which leadeth to the city that hath unmoveable foundations. In the text we have three things.</P>
<P N="1">1. The &s;tate of Innocence wherein man was created, <HI>God hath made man upright.</HI> By Man here, we are to under&s;tand our fir&s;t Parents; the archetypal pair, the root of mankind, the compendized world, and the fountain from whence all generations have &s;treamed; as may appear by comparing Gen. v. 1, 2. <HI>In the day that God created man, in the likene&s;s of God made he him, male and female created he them, and ble&s;&s;ed them,</HI> (as the root of mankind,) <HI>and called their name Adam.</HI> The original words is the &s;ame in our text, in this &s;en&s;e, man was made right, (agreeable to the nature of God, who&s;e work is perfect) without any imperfection, corruption, or principle of corruption in his body or &s;oul. He was made upright; that is, &s;traight with the will and law of God, without any irregularity in his &s;oul. By the &s;et it
<PB N="18" REF="045042_0015_101F7C9CF2238688">
got in its creation, it directly pointed towards God, as his chief end; which &s;traight inclination was repre&s;ented as in an emblem, by the erect figure of his body a figure that no other living creature partakes of. What David was in a go&s;pel &s;en&s;e, that was he in a legal &s;en&s;e, one according to God's own heart&punc; altogether righteous, pure and holy. God made him thus: he did not fir&s;t make him, and then make him righteous; but in the very making of him, he made him righteous. Original righteou&s;ne&s;s was concreated with him; &s;o that in the &s;ame moment he was a man, he was a righteous man, morally good; with the &s;ame breath that God breathed in him a living &s;oul, he breathed in him a righteous &s;oul</P>

<HEAD>Of <HI>MAN's</HI> Original Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HEAD>
<P>FIRST, As to the righteou&s;ne&s;s of this &s;tate, con&s;ider, that as uncreated righteou&s;ne&s;s, the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God is the &s;upreme rule; &s;o all created righteou&s;ne&s;s, whether of men or angels, hath re&s;pect to a law as its rule, and is a conformity thereunto A creature can no more be morally independent on God&punc; in it's actions and powers, than it can be naturally independent on him. A creature, as a crea|ture, mu&s;t acknowledge the Creator's will as it's &s;upreme law for as it cannot be without him, &s;o it mu&s;t not be but for him, and ac|cording to his will: yet no law obliges, until it be revealed And hence it follows, that there was a law which man, as a rational crea|ture, was &s;ubjected to in his creation; and that this law was revealed to him. <HI>God made man upright,</HI> &s;ays the text This pre&s;uppo&s;eth a law to which he was conformed in his creation; as when any thing is made regular, or according to rule, of nece&s;&s;ity the rule it&s;elf is pre&s;uppo&s;ed. Whence we may gather, that this law was no other than the eternal, indi&s;pen&s;ible law of righteou&s;ne&s;s, ob&s;erved in all points by the &s;econd Adam, oppo&s;ed by the carnal mind, &s;ome notions of which remain yet among the Pagans, who, <HI>having not the law, are a law unto them&s;elves,</HI> Rom. ii. 15. In a word, this law is the very &s;ame which was afterwards &s;ummed up in the Ten Commandments, and promulgate on Mount Sinai to the I&s;raelites, called by us the Moral Law: and man's righteou&s;ne&s;s con&s;i&s;ted in conformity to this law or rule. More particularly, there is a two fold conformity required of a man; a conformity of the powers of his &s;oul to the law, which you may call habitual righteou&s;ne&s;s; and a conformity of all his actions to it, which is actual righteou&s;ne&s;s. Now, God made man habitually righteous; man was to make him&s;elf actually righteous: the former was the &s;tock God put into his hand; the latter, the improvement he &s;hould have made of it. The &s;um of what I have &s;aid, is, that the righteou&s;ne&s;s wherein man was created, was the conformity of all the faculties and powers of his &s;oul to the moral law. This is what we call original righteou&s;ne&s;s, which man was originally endued with. We may take it up in the&s;e three things.</P>
<P>FIRST, Man's under&s;tanding was a lamp of light. He had perfect knowledge of the law, and of his duty accordingly: he was made after God's image, and con&s;equently could not want knowledge, which is a part thereof, Col. iii. 10. <HI>The new Man is renewed in knowledge, after the image of him that created him.</HI> And indeed this was nece&s;&s;ary, to fit him for univer&s;al obedience, &s;eeing no obedience can be according to the law, unle&s;s it proceed from a &s;en&s;e of the commandment of God requiring it. 'Tis true, Adam had not the
<PB N="20" REF="045042_0017_101F7CA1EED401B0">
law written upon tables of &s;tone, but it was written upon his mind, the knowledge thereof being concreated with him. God impre&s;&s;ed it upon his &s;oul, and made him a law to him&s;elf, as the remains of it among the heathers do te&s;tify, Rom. ii. 14, 15. And &s;eeing man was made to be the mouth of the creation, to glorify God in his works; we have ground to believe he had naturally an exqui&s;ite knowledge of the works of God. We have a proof of this, in his giving names to the bea&s;ts of the field, and the fowls of the air, and the&s;e &s;uch as expre&s;s their nature: <HI>What&s;oever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof,</HI> Gen. ii. 19. And the dominion which God gave him over the creatures, &s;oberly to u&s;e and di&s;po&s;e of them according to his will (&s;till in &s;ubordination to the will of God) &s;eems to require no le&s;s than a knowledge of their natures. And be&s;ides all this, his perfect knowledge of the law, proves his knowledge in the management of civil affairs, which, in re&s;pect of the law of God, <HI>a good man will guide with di&s;cretion,</HI> P&s;al. cxii. 5.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, His will lay &s;traight with the will of God, Eph. iv. 24. There was no corruption in his will, no bent nor inclination to evil; for that is &s;in properly and truly &s;o called: hence the apo&s;tle &s;ays, Rom. vii. 7. <HI>I had not known &s;in, but by the law; for I had not known lu&s;t, except the law had &s;aid, Thou &s;halt not covet.</HI> An inclination to evil, is really a fountain of &s;in, and therefore incon&s;i&s;tent with that rectitude and uprightne&s;s which the text expre&s;ly &s;ays he was endued with at his creation. The will of man then was directed, and naturally inclined to God and goodne&s;s, tho' mutably. It was di&s;|po&s;ed, by its original make, to follow the Creator's will, as the &s;hadow does the body; and was not left in an equal ballance to good and evil: for at that rate he had not been upright, nor habitually conform to the law, which in no moment can allow the creature not to be inclined towards God as his chief end, more than it can allow man to be a god to him&s;elf. The law was impre&s;&s;ed upon Adam's &s;oul: now this according to the new covenant, by which the image of God is repaired, con&s;i&s;ts in two things: 1. Putting the law into the mind, denoting the knowledge of it: 2. Writing it in the heart, denoting inclinations in the will, an&s;werable to the commands of the law, Heb. viii. 10. So that, as the will, when we con&s;ider it as renewed by grace, is by that grace natively inclined to the &s;ame holi|ne&s;s in all it's parts which the law requires; &s;o was the will of man (when we con&s;ider him as God made him at fir&s;t) endued with natural inclinations to every thing commanded by the law. For if the regenerate are partakers of the divine nature, as undoubtedly they are, for &s;o &s;ays the Scripture, 2 Pet. i. 4. And if this divine nature can import no le&s;s than inclinations of the heart to holine&s;s; then, &s;urely Adam's will could not want this inclination; for in him the image of God was perfect. It is true, 'tis &s;aid, Rom. ii<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">5. That <HI>the Gentiles &s;hew the work of the law written in their hearts</HI>&punc; but this denotes only their knowledge of that law, &s;uch as it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">; that the
<PB N="21" REF="045042_0018_101F7CA3B41000C0">
Apo&s;tle to the Hebrews, in the text cited, takes the word <HI>heart,</HI> in another &s;en&s;e, di&s;tingui&s;hing it plainly from the mind. And it mu&s;t be granted, that, when God promi&s;eth in the new covenant, to write his law in the hearts of his people, it imports quite another thing than what Heathens have: for tho' they have notions of it in their mind, yet their hearts go another way; their will has got a &s;et and a bla&s;s quite contrary to that law; and therefore, the expre&s;&s;ion &s;uitable to the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, mu&s;t needs import, be&s;ides the&s;e notions of the <HI>mind,</HI> inclinations of the <HI>will</HI> going along therewith; which inclinati|ons, tho' mixed with corruption in the regenerate, were pure and un|mixed in upright Adam In a word as Adam knew his Ma&s;ter's plea&s;ure in the matter of duty &s;o his <HI>will</HI> &s;tood inclined to what he know.</P>
<P>THIRDLY, His affections were orderly, pure and holy; which is a nece&s;&s;ary part of that uprightne&s;s wherein man was created. The Apo&s;tle has a po&s;ition, 2 The&s;&s; iii. 5. <HI>The Lord direct your hearts into the love of God:</HI> that is, <HI>The Lord &s;traighten your hearts,</HI> or make them ly &s;traight to the love of God: and our text tells us, man was thus made &s;traight. <HI>The new man is created in righteou&s;ne&s;s and true holine&s;s,</HI> Eph. iv. 24 Now this holine&s;s as it is di&s;tingui&s;hed from righteou&s;ne&s;s, may import the purity and orderline&s;s of the affections. And thus the Apo&s;tle&punc; 1 Tim. ii. 8. will have men to pray, <HI>Lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting:</HI> becau&s;e, as troubled water is unfit to receive the image of the &s;un; &s;o the heart, filled with impure and di&s;orderly affections, is not fit for divine communications. Man's &s;en&s;itive appetite was indeed naturally carried out towards objects grateful to the &s;en&s;es. For &s;eeing man was made up of body and &s;oul, and God made this man to glorify and enjoy him; and for this end to u&s;e his good creatures in &s;ubordination to him&s;elf: it is plain that man was naturally inclined both to &s;piritual and &s;en&s;ible good; yet to &s;piritual good, the chief good as his ultimate end. And there|fore his &s;en&s;itive motions and inclinations, were &s;ubordinate to his rea&s;on and will, which lay &s;traight with the will of God, and were not, in the lea&s;t, contrary to the &s;ame. Otherwi&s;e he &s;hould have been made up of contradictions; his &s;oul being naturally inclined to God as the chief end, in the &s;uperior part thereof, and the &s;ame &s;oul inclined to the creature as the chief end in the inferior part thereof, as they call it&punc; which is impo&s;&s;ible; for man, at the &s;ame in&s;tant, cannot have two chief ends. Man's affections them in his primitive &s;tate, were pure from all defilement, free from all di&s;order and di&s;temper, becau&s;e in all their motions they were duly &s;ubjected to his clear rea&s;on, and his holy will. He had al&s;o an executive power an&s;werable to his will; a power to do the good which he knew &s;hould be done, and which he inclined to do, even &s;o fulfil the whole law of God. If it had not been &s;o, God would not have required of him perfect obedience; for to &s;ay that <HI>the Lord gathereth where he hath not &s;trawed,</HI> is but the bla&s;phemy of a wicked heart, again&s;t a good and bountiful God, Mat. xxv. 24.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="045042_0019_101F7CA5DEA82118">From what has been &s;aid, it may be gathered, that the original righteou&s;ne&s;s explained was univer&s;al and natural; yet mutable.</P>
<P>FIRST, It was univer&s;al; both with re&s;pect to the &s;ubject of it, the whole man; and the object of it, the whole law. Univer&s;al I &s;ay, with re&s;pect to the &s;ubject of it; for this righteou&s;ne&s;s was diffu&s;ed through the whole man; it was a ble&s;&s;ed leaven that leavened the whole lump. There was not one wrong pin in the tabernacle of human nature, when God &s;et it up, however &s;hattered it is now. Man was then holy in &s;oul, body, and &s;pirit: while the &s;oul remained untainted, it's lodging was kept pure and undefiled: the members of the body were con&s;ecrated ve&s;&s;els, and in&s;truments of righteou&s;ne&s;s, A combat betwixt fle&s;h and &s;pirit, rea&s;on and appetite; nay the lea&s;t inclination to &s;in, lu&s;t of the fle&s;h in the inferior part of the &s;oul, was utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with this uprightne&s;s, in which man was created: and as been invented to vail the corruption of man's nature, and to ob&s;cure the grace of God in Je&s;us Chri&s;t: it looks very like the language of fallen Adam, laying his own &s;in at his Maker's door, Gen. iii. 12. <HI>The woman whom thou gave&s;t to be with me, &s;he gave me of the tree, and I did eat:</HI> But as this righteou&s;ne&s;s was univer&s;al in re&s;pect of the &s;ubject, becau&s;e it &s;pread through the whole man, &s;o al&s;o it was univer&s;al, in re&s;pect of the object, the holy law: There was nothing in the law, but what was agreeable to his rea&s;on and will, as God made him: tho' &s;in hath now &s;et him at odds with it: his &s;oul was &s;hapen out, in length and breadth to the commandment, tho' exceeding broad: &s;o that this original righteou&s;ne&s;s was not only perfect in parts, but in degrees.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, As it was univer&s;al, &s;o it was natural to him, and not &s;upernatural in that &s;tate. Not that it was e&s;&s;ential to man, as man; for then he could not have lo&s;t it, without the lo&s;s of his very being; but it was con-natural to him: He was created with it, and it was nece&s;&s;ary to the perfection of man, as he came out of the hand of God: nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;titute him in a &s;tate of integrity. Yet,</P>
<P>THIRDLY, It was mutable; it was a righteou&s;ne&s;s that might be lo&s;t, as is manife&s;ted by the doleful event: His will was not ab&s;o|lutely indifferent to good or evil; God &s;et it towards good only; yet he did not &s;o fix and confirm it's inclinations, that it could not alter. No, it was moveable to evil: and that only by man him&s;elf, God having given him a &s;ufficient power to &s;tand in this integrity, if he had plea&s;ed: Let no man quarrel God's works in this; for if Adam had been unchangeably righteous, he behoved to have been &s;o either by nature, or by free gift: by nature he could not be &s;o, for that is proper to God, and incommunicable to any creature: if by free gift, then no wrong was done him, in with-holding of what he could not crave. Confirmation in a righteous &s;tate, is a reward of grace, given upon continuing righteous, thro' the &s;tate of trial; and would have been given to Adam, if he had &s;tood out the time appointed for probation by the Creator; and accordingly is given to the &s;aints,
<PB N="23" REF="045042_0020_101F7CAC871AF458">
upon the account of the merits of Chri&s;t, who was obedient even to the death And herein believers have the advantage of Adam, that they can never totally nor finally fall away from grace.</P>
<P>Thus was man made originally righteous, being created in God's own image, Gen. i. 27. which con&s;i&s;ts in the po&s;itive qualities of knowledge, righteou&s;ne&s;s and holine&s;s, Col. iii. 10. Eph. iv. 24. All that God made was very good, according to their &s;everal natures, Gen. i. 31. And &s;o was man morally good, being made after the image of Him, who is <HI>good and upright,</HI> P&s;al. xxv. 8 Without this, he could not have an&s;wered the great end of his creation, which was to know, love, and &s;erve his God, according to his will. Nay, he could not be created otherwi&s;e: for he behoved either to be conform to the law, in his powers, principles, and inclinations, or not: if he was, then he was righteous: and if not, he was a &s;inner, which is ab&s;urd and horrible to imagine</P>

<HEAD>Of <HI>MAN'S</HI> Original Happine&s;s.</HEAD>
<P>SECONDLY, I &s;hall lay before you &s;ome of those things which did accompany or flow from the righteou&s;ne&s;s of man's primitive &s;tate: Happine&s;s is the re&s;ult of holine&s;s; and as it was an holy, &s;o it was an happy &s;tate.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Man was then a very glorious creature. We have rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, that as Mo&s;es' face &s;hone when he came down from the mount, &s;o man had a very light&s;ome and plea&s;ant countenance, and beautiful body, while as yet there was no darkne&s;s of &s;in in him at all. But &s;eeing God him&s;elf is glorious in holine&s;s, (Exod. xv. 11.) &s;urely that &s;piritual comeline&s;s the Lord put upon man at his creation, made him a very glorious creature. O! how did light &s;hine in his holy conver&s;ation, to the glory of the Creator! while every action was but the darting forth of a ray and beam of that glorious, unmixed light&punc; which God had &s;et up in his &s;oul; while that lamp of love, lighted from Heaven, continued burning in his heart, as in the holy place; and the law of the Lord, put in his inward parts by the finger of God, was kept by him there, as in the mo&s;t holy: There was no impurity to be &s;een without; no &s;quint look in the eyes, after any unclean thing; the tongue &s;poke nothing but the language of Heaven: And, in a word, <HI>The King's &s;on was all glorious within, and his clothing of wrought gold.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> He was the favourite of Heaven: He &s;hone brightly in the image of God. who cannot but love his own image, where-ever it appears. While he was alone in the world, he was not alone, for God was with him: His communion and fellow&s;hip was with his Creator, and that immediately; for as yet there was nothing to turn away the face of God from the work of his own hands; &s;eeing &s;in had not as yet entered, which alone could make the breach.</P>
<P>By the favour of God, he was advanced to be confederate with Heaven, in the fir&s;t Covenant, called, The Covenant of Works. God reduced the Law, which he gave in his creation, into the form
<PB N="24" REF="045042_0021_101F7CAE0F1C5CC8">
of a Covenant, whereof perfect obedience was the condition: life was the thing promi&s;ed, and death the penalty. As for the condition, one great branch of the natural Law was, that man believe what&s;o|ever God &s;hall reveal, and do what&s;oever he &s;hall command: Accord|ingly God making this Covenant with man, extended his duty to the not eating of the tree of knowledge of good and evil; and the law thus extended, was the rule of man's covenant-obedience. How ea&s;y were the&s;e terms to him, who had the natural law written on his heart; and that inclining him to obey this po&s;itive Law, revealed to him, it &s;eems, by an audible voice, (Gen. ii. 16.) the matter whereof was &s;o very ea&s;y ? And indeed it was highly rea&s;onable that the rule and matter of his covenant-obedience &s;hould be thus ex|tended: that which was added, being a thing in it&s;elf indifferent, where his obedience was to turn upon the preci&s;e point of the will of God, the plaine&s;t evidence of true obedience, and it being in an external thing, wherein his obedience or di&s;obedience would be mo&s;t clear and con&s;picuous.</P>
<P>Now, upon this condition, God promi&s;ed him life, the continuance of natural life in the union of &s;oul and body; and of &s;piritual life in the favour of his Creator: he promi&s;ed him al&s;o eternal life in heaven, to have been entered into, when he &s;hould have pa&s;&s;ed the time of his trial upon earth, and the Lord &s;hould &s;ee meet to tran&s;port him into the upper Paradi&s;e. This promi&s;e of life was included in the threatning of death mentioned, Gen. ii. l7. For while God &s;ays, <HI>In the day thou eate&s;t thereof, thou &s;halt &s;urely die;</HI> it is in effect, <HI>If thou do not eat of it, thou &s;halt &s;urely live:</HI> And this was &s;acramentally confirmed by another tree in the garden, called therefore, <HI>the Tree of Life,</HI> which he was debarred from, when he had &s;inned, Gen. iii. 22, 23. &mdash;<HI>Le&s;t he put forth his hand, and take al&s;o of the Tree of Life, and eat, and live for ever. Therefore the Lord God &s;ent him forth from the garden of Eden.</HI> Yet it is not to be thought, that man's life and death did hang only on this matter of the forbidden fruit, but on the whole Law; for &s;o &s;ays the Apo&s;tle, Gal. iii. 10. <HI>It is written, Cur&s;ed is every one that continueth not in all things, which are written in the Book of the Law, to do them.</HI> That of the forbidden fruit, was a revealed part of Adam's religion; and &s;o behoved expre&s;ly to be laid before him: but as to the natural Law, he naturally knew death to be the reward of di&s;obedience; for the very Heathens were not ignorant of this: <HI>Knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit &s;uch things are worthy of death,</HI> Rom. i. 32. And moreover, the promi&s;e included in the threatning, &s;ecured Adam's life according to the Covenant, as long as he obeyed the natural Law with the addition of that po&s;itive command; &s;o that he needed nothing to be expre&s;&s;ed to him in the Covenant, but what concerned the eating of the forbidden fruit: That eternal life in heaven was promi&s;ed in this Covenant, is plain from this, that the threatning was of eternal death in hell; to which when man had made him&s;elf liable, Chri&s;t was promi&s;ed, by his death to purcha&s;e
<PB N="25" REF="045042_0022_101F7CB26430F038">
eternal life: and Chri&s;t him&s;elf expounds the promi&s;e of the Cove|nant of Works of eternal life, while he promi&s;eth the condition of that Covenant, to a proud young man, who tho' he had not Adam's &s;tock, yet would needs enter into life in the way of working, as Adam was to have done under this covenant, Matth. xix. 17. <HI>If thou wilt enter into life,</HI> (viz. eternal life, by doing, ver. 16.) <HI>keep the Commandments.</HI></P>
<P>The penalty was death, Gen. ii. 17 <HI>In the day that thou eate&s;t thereof, thou &s;halt &s;urely die:</HI> The death threatned was &s;uch, as the life promi&s;ed was; and that mo&s;t ju&s;tly, to wit, temporal, &s;piritual, and eternal death. The event is a commentary on this: for that very day he did eat thereof, he was a dead man in law; but the execution was &s;topped, becau&s;e of his po&s;terity then in his loins; and another Covenant was prepared; however, that day his body got it's death-wound, and became mortal. Death al&s;o &s;eized his &s;oul: he lo&s;t his original righteou&s;ne&s;s and the favour of God; witne&s;s the gripes and throws of con&s;cience, which made him hide him&s;elf from God. And he became liable to eternal death, which would have actually followed of cour&s;e, if a Mediator had not been provided, who found him bound with the cords of death, as a malefactor ready to be led to execution. Thus you have a &s;hort de&s;cription of the Covenant into which the Lord brought man, in the e&s;tate of innocence.</P>
<P>And &s;eemeth it a &s;mall thing unto you, that earth was thus con|federate with heaven? This could have been done to none but him, whom the King of heaven delighted to honour. It was an act of grace worthy of the gracious God who&s;e favourite he was; for there was grace and free favour in the fir&s;t covenant, tho' <HI>the exceeding riches of grace,</HI> (as the Apo&s;tle calls it, Eph. ii 7.) was re&s;erved for the &s;econd. It was certainly an act of grace, favour, and admirable conde&s;cen&s;ion in God, to enter into a covenant, and &s;uch a covenant with his own creature. Man was not at his own, but at God's di&s;po&s;al: Nor had he any thing to work with, but what he had received from God. There was no proportion betwixt the work and the promi&s;ed reward. Before that covenant, man was bound to perfect obedience, in virtue of his natural dependence on God: and death was naturally the wages of &s;in; which the ju&s;tice of God could and would have required, tho' there had never been any covenant betwixt God and man: but God was free; man could never have required eternal life as the reward of his work, if there had not been &s;uch a Covenant. God was free to have di&s;po&s;ed of his creature as he &s;aw meet: and if he had &s;tood in his integrity as long as the world &s;hould &s;tand, and there had been no Covenant promi&s;ing eternal life to him upon his obedience; God might have withdrawn his &s;upport|ing hand at la&s;t, and &s;o made him creep back into the womb of nothing, whence almighty power had drawn him out: And what wrong could there have been in this, while God &s;hould have taken back what he freely gave? But now the Covenant being made, God becomes debtor to his own faithfulne&s;s: if man will work, he may

crave the reward on the ground of the Covenant: Well might the angels then, upon his being rai&s;ed to this dignity, have given him that &s;alutation, <HI>Hail thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> God made him lord of the world, prince of the inferior creatures, univer&s;al lord and emperor of the whole earth. His Creator gave him dominion over the fi&s;h of the &s;ea, and over the fowls of the air, over all the earth; yea, and every living thing that liveth upon the earth: <HI>He put all things under his feet,</HI> P&s;al. viii. 6, 7, 8. He gave him a power &s;oberly to u&s;e and di&s;po&s;e of the creatures in the earth, &s;ea, and air. Thus man was God's depute-governor in the lower world; and this his dominion was an image of God's &s;overeignty. This was common to the man and the woman; but the man had one thing peculiar to him, to wit, that he had dominion ever the woman al&s;o, 1 Cor. xi. 7. Behold how the creatures came to him, to own their &s;ubjection, and to do him homage as their lord; and quietly &s;tood before him, till he put names on them as his own, Gen. ii. 10. Man's face &s;truck an awe upon them; the &s;toute&s;t creatures &s;tood a&s;toni&s;hed, tamely and quietly adoring him as their lord and ruler. Thus was man <HI>crowned with glory and honour,</HI> P&s;al. viii. 5. The Lord dealt mo&s;t liberally and bountifully with him, <HI>put all things under his feet;</HI> only he kept one thing, one tree in the garden out of his hands, even the tree of knowledge of good and evil.</P>
<P>But you may &s;ay, And did he grudge him this? I an&s;wer, Nay; but when he had made him thus holy and happy, he graciou&s;ly gave him this re&s;triction, which was in it's own nature, a prop and &s;tay to keep him from falling. And this I &s;ay, upon the&s;e three grounds. (1) As it was mo&s;t proper for the honour of God, who had made man lord of the lower world, to a&s;&s;ert his &s;overeign dominion over all, by &s;ome particular vi&s;ible &s;ign; &s;o it was mo&s;t proper for man's &s;afety. Man being &s;et down in a beautiful paradi&s;e, it was an act of infinite wi&s;dom, and of grace too, to keep from him one &s;ingle tree, as a vi&s;ible te&s;timony, that he mu&s;t hold all of his Creator, as his great Landlord; that &s;o, while he &s;aw him&s;elf lord of the creatures, he might not forget that he was &s;till God's &s;ubject. (2.) This was a memorial of his mutable &s;tate given in to him from heaven, to be laid up by him for his great caution: For man was created with a free will to good, which the Tree of Life was an evidence of: but his will was al&s;o free to evil, and the Forbidden Tree was to him a memorial thereof. It was, in a manner, a continual watch-word to him again&s;t evil, a beacon &s;et up before him, to bid him beware of da&s;hing him&s;elf to pieces, on the rock of &s;in. (3.) God made man upright, directed towards God as the chief end. He &s;et him like Mo&s;es, on the top of the hill, holding up his hands to heaven: and as Aaron and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r &s;tayed up Mo&s;es' hands, Exod. xv. 10, 11, 12. &s;o God gave man an erect figure of body, and forbid him the eating of this tree; to keep him in that po&s;ture of uprightne&s;s, wherein he was created. God made the bea&s;ts looking down towards the earth, to
<PB N="27" REF="045042_0024_101F7CB8ECC891B0">
&s;hew that their &s;atisfaction might be brought from thence; and ac|cordingly it does afford them what is commen&s;urable to their appetite: but the erect figure of man's body, which looketh upward, &s;hewed him, that his happine&s;s lay above him in God; and that he was to expect it from heaven, and not from earth. Now this fair Tree, of which he was forbidden to eat, taught him the &s;ame le&s;&s;on; that his happine&s;s lay not in enjoyment of the creatures, for there was a want even in Paradi&s;e: &s;o that the forbidden Tree was in effect the hand of all the creatures, pointing man away from them&s;elves to God for happine&s;s: It was a &s;ign of emptine&s;s hung before the door of the creation, with that in&s;cription, <HI>This is not your re&s;t.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> As he had a perfect tranquillity within his own brea&s;t, &s;o he had a perfect calm without: His heart had nothing to reproach him with; con&s;cience then had nothing to do, but to direct, approve and fea&s;t him: and without, there was nothing to annoy him: The happy pair lived in perfect amity; and tho' their knowledge was va&s;t, true and clear, they knew no &s;hame: Tho' they were naked, there were no blu&s;hes in their faces; for &s;in, the &s;eed of &s;hame was not yet &s;own, Gen. ii. 25. and their beautiful bodies were not capable of injuries from the air; &s;o they had no need of clothes, which are origi|nally the badges of our &s;hame: They were liable to no di&s;ea&s;es, nor pains; and tho' they were not to live idle; yet toil, wearine&s;s, and &s;weat of the brows, were not known in this &s;tate.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> Man had a life of pure delight, and undreggy plea&s;ure in this &s;tate: Rivers of pure plea&s;ures run through it: The earth, with the product thereof, was now in its glory; nothing had yet come in, to mar the beauty of the creatures. God &s;et him down, not in a common place of the earth; but in <HI>Eden,</HI> a place eminent for plea&s;ant|ne&s;s, as the name of it imports: nay, not only in <HI>Eden,</HI> but in the <HI>garden of Eden;</HI> the mo&s;t plea&s;ant &s;pot of that plea&s;ant place: a garden planted by God him&s;elf, to be the man&s;ion-hou&s;e of this his favourite. As, when God made the other living creatures, he &s;aid, <HI>Let the water bring forth the moving creature,</HI> Gen i. 20. And, <HI>Let the earth bring firt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the living creature,</HI> ver. 24. But when man was to be made, he &s;aid, <HI>Let us make man,</HI> ver. 20. So, when the re&s;t of the earth was to be furni&s;hed with herbs and trees, God &s;aid, <HI>Let the earth bring forth gra&s;s, and the fruit-tree,</HI> Gen. i. 11. But of paradi&s;e it is &s;aid, <HI>God planted it,</HI> chap. ii. 8. which cannot but denote a &s;ingular excellency in that garden, beyond all other parts of the th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> beautiful earth. There he wanted neither for nece&s;&s;ity nor delight: for there was <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ry tree that is plea&s;ant to the &s;ight, and good for food,</HI> ver. 9. He know not the&s;e delights which luxury has invented for the gratifying of lu&s;ts: but his delights were &s;uch as came out of the hand of God; without pa&s;&s;ing thro' &s;inful hands, which readily leave marks of im|purity on what they touch. So his delights were pure, his plea&s;ures refined. And yet may <HI>I now &s;hew you a more excellent way: wi&s;dom had entered into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">is heart:</HI> &s;urely then knowledge was plea&s;ant unto
<PB N="28" REF="045042_0025_101F7CBBD6AC8120">
his &s;oul. What delight do &s;ome find in their di&s;coveries of the works of nature, by the &s;crapes of knowledge they have gathered! but how much more exqui&s;ite plea&s;ure had <HI>Adam,</HI> while his piercing eyes read the book of God's works, which God laid before him, to the end he might glorify him in the &s;ame; and therefore he had &s;urely &s;itted him for the work! but above all, his knowledge of God, and that as his God, and the communion he had with him, could not but afford him the mo&s;t refined and exqui&s;ite plea&s;ure in the innermo&s;t rece&s;&s;es of his heart. Great is that delight which the &s;aints find in the&s;e views of the glory of God, that their &s;ouls are &s;ometimes let into, while they are compa&s;&s;ed about with many infirmities; but much more may well be allowed to &s;inle&s;s <HI>Adam;</HI> no doubt he reli&s;hed the&s;e plea&s;ures at another rate</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> He was immortal. He would never have died, if he had not &s;inned; it was in ca&s;e of &s;in that death was threatned, Gen. ii 17. which &s;hews it to be the con&s;equent of &s;in, and not of the &s;inle&s;s human nature. The perfect con&s;titution of his body, which came out of God's hand very good; and the righteou&s;ne&s;s and holine&s;s of his &s;oul, removed all inward cau&s;es of death: nothing being prepared for the grave's devouring mouth, but the vile body, Philip iii 21. And <HI>tho&s;e who have &s;inned,</HI> Job xxiv. 19. And God's &s;pecial care of his innocent creature, &s;ecured him again&s;t outward violence. The apo&s;tle's te&s;timony is expre&s;s, Rom. v. 12. <HI>By one man &s;in entered into the world, and death by &s;in.</HI> Behold the door by which death came in! Satan wrought with his lies till he got it opened, and &s;o death entred; and therefore is he &s;aid to have been <HI>a murderer from the beginning</HI> John viii. 44.</P>
<P>Thus have I &s;hown you the holine&s;s and happine&s;s of man in this &s;tate. If any &s;hall &s;ay, What's all this to us, who never ta&s;ted of that holy and happy &s;tate? They mu&s;t know it nearly concerns us, in &s;o far as <HI>Adam</HI> was the root of all mankind, our common head and repre&s;entative; who received from God our inheritance and &s;tock to keep it for him&s;elf and his children, and to convey it to them. The Lord put all mankind's &s;tock (as it were) in one &s;hip: and, as we our&s;elves &s;hould have done, he made our common father the pilot. He put a ble&s;&s;ing in the root, to have been, if rightly managed, diffu&s;ed into all the branches. According to our text, making <HI>Adam</HI> upright, he made man upright; and all mankind had that upright|ne&s;s in him; for, <HI>if the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oot be holy, &s;o are the branches.</HI> But more of this afterwards. Had <HI>Adam</HI> &s;tood, none would have quarrelled the repre&s;entation.</P>
<P>USE I. For <HI>Information.</HI> This &s;hews us, (1) That not God, but man him&s;elf was the cau&s;e of his ruin. God made him upright: his Creator &s;et him up, but he threw him&s;elf down. Was the Lord's directing and inclining him to good the rea&s;on of his woful choice? Or did heaven deal &s;o &s;paringly with him, that his pre&s;&s;ing wants &s;ent him to hell to &s;eek &s;upply? Nay, man was, and is, the cau&s;e of
<PB N="29" REF="045042_0026_101F7CC1EF27BF30">
his own ruin. (2.) God may mo&s;t ju&s;tly require of men perfect obedience to his law, and condemn them for their not obeying it perfectly, tho' now they have no ability to keep it. In &s;o doing, <HI>he gathers</HI> but <HI>where he has &s;trawed.</HI> He gave man ability to keep the whole law; man has lo&s;t it by his own fault: but his &s;in could never take away that right which God hath to exact perfect obedience of his creature, and to puni&s;h in ca&s;e of di&s;obedience. (3.) Behold here the infinite obligation we ly under&punc; to Je&s;us Chri&s;t the &s;econd <HI>Adam;</HI> who with his own precious blood has bought our e&s;cheat. and freely makes offer of it again to us, Ho&s; xiii. 9. and that with the advantage of everla&s;ting &s;ecurity, that it can never be altogether lo&s;t any more, John x. 28, 29. Free grace will fix tho&s;e, whom free-will &s;hook down into a gulf of mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>USE II. This reacheth a reproof to three &s;orts of per&s;ons. (1.) To the&s;e, who hate religion in the power of it, where-ever it appears; and can take plea&s;ure in nothing, but in the world and their lu&s;ts. Surely tho&s;e men are far from righteou&s;ne&s;s; they are <HI>haters of God,</HI> Rom. i 30. for they are haters of his image. Upright <HI>Adam</HI> in Paradi&s;e, would have been a great eye-&s;ore to all &s;uch per&s;ons; as he was to the &s;erpent, who&s;e &s;eed they prove them&s;elves to be, by their malignity. (2.) It reproves tho&s;e who put religion to &s;hame, and tho&s;e who are a&s;hamed of religion, before a gracele&s;s world. There is a generation who make &s;o bold with the God that made them, and can in a moment cru&s;h them, that they ridicule piety, and make a mock of &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s. <HI>Again&s;t whom do ye &s;port your &s;elves? Again&s;t whom make ye a wide mouth, and draw out the tongue?</HI> I&s;a. lvii. 4. Is it not again&s;t God him&s;elf, who&s;e image, in &s;ome mea&s;ure repaired on &s;ome of his creatures, makes them fools in your eyes? But <HI>be ye not mockers, le&s;t your bands be made &s;trong,</HI> I&s;a. xxviii. 22. Holine&s;s was the glory God put on man, when he made him: but now &s;ons of men turn that glory into frame, becau&s;e they them&s;elves glory in their &s;hame &mdash; There are others that &s;ecretly approve of religion, and in religious company will profe&s;s it: who at other times, to be neighbour-like are a&s;hamed to own it&punc; &s;o weak are they, that they are blown over with the wind of the wicked's mouth. A broad laughter, an impious je&s;t, a &s;illy gibe out of a prophane mouth, is to many an unan&s;werable argument again&s;t religion and &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s; for in the cau&s;e of religion, they are <HI>as &s;illy doves without heart.</HI> O that &s;uch would con&s;ider that weighty word! Mark viii 38. <HI>Who&s;oever therefore &s;hall be a&s;hamed of me, and of my words, in this adulterous and &s;inful gene|ration; of him al&s;o &s;hall the Son of man be a&s;hamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.</HI> (3.) It reproves the proud &s;elf-conceited profe&s;&s;or, who admires him&s;elf in a garment he hath patched together of rags. There are many, who, when once they have gathered &s;ome &s;crapes of knowledge of religion, and have at|tained to &s;ome reformation of life, do &s;well big with conceit of them|&s;elves; a &s;ad &s;ign that the effects of the fall ly &s;o heavy upon them,
<PB N="30" REF="045042_0027_101F7CC404764DB0">
that they have not as yet come to them&s;elves, Luke xv. 17. They have eyes behind, to &s;ee their attainments; but no eyes within, no eyes before, to &s;ee their wants, which would &s;urely humble them: for true knowledge makes men to &s;ee, both what once they were, and what they are at pre&s;ent; and &s;o is humbling, and will not &s;uffer them to be content with any mea&s;ure of grace attained; but puts them on to pre&s;s forward, <HI>forgetting the things that are behind,</HI> Philip. iii. 13, 14. But tho&s;e men are &s;uch a &s;pectacle of commi&s;eration, as one would be, that had &s;et his palace on fire, and were glorifying in a cottage he had built for him&s;elf out of the rubbi&s;h, tho' &s;o very weak, that it could not &s;tand again&s;t a &s;torm.</P>
<P>USE III Of <HI>lamentation.</HI> Here was a &s;tately building, man carved like a fair palace, but now lying in a&s;hes: let us &s;tand and look on the ruins, and drop a tear. This is a lamentation, and &s;hall be for a lamentation. Could we chu&s;e but to weep, if we &s;aw our country ruined, and turned by the enemy into a wilderne&s;s? If we &s;aw our hou&s;es on fire, and our hou&s;holds peri&s;hing in the flames? But all this comes far &s;hort of the di&s;mal &s;ight, <HI>man fallen as a &s;tar from heaven!</HI> Ah! may not we now &s;ay, <HI>O that we were as in months pa&s;t,</HI> when there were no &s;tains in our nature, no clouds on our minds, no pollu|tion in our hearts. Had we never been in better ca&s;e, the matter had been le&s;s: but <HI>they that were brought up in &s;carlet,</HI> do now <HI>embrace dung-hills.</HI> Where is our primitive glory now! Once no darkne&s;s in the mind, no rebellion in the will, no di&s;order in the affections. But, ah! <HI>How is the faithful city become an harlot? Righteou&s;ne&s;s lodged in it; but now murderers. Our &s;ilver is become dro&s;s, our wine mixed with water.</HI> That heart which was once the temple of God, is now turned into a den of thieves. Let our name be <HI>Ichabod,</HI> for the glory is departed. Happy wa&s;t tho O man, who was like unto thee! No pain or &s;ickne&s;s could affect thee, no death could approach thee, no &s;igh was heard from thee, till the&s;e bitter fruits were plucked off the forbidden tree. Heaven &s;hone upon thee, and earth &s;miled: thou wa&s;t: the companion of angels, and the envy of devils. But how low is he now laid, who was created for dominion, and made lord of the world! <HI>The crown is fallen from our head: wo unto us that we have &s;inned.</HI> The creatures that waited to do him &s;ervice, are now, &s;ince the fall, &s;et in battle-array again&s;t him; and the lea&s;t of them having commi&s;&s;ion proves too hard for him. Waters overflow the old world, fire con&s;umes <HI>Sodom;</HI> the &s;tars in their cour&s;es fight again&s;t <HI>Si&s;era;</HI> frogs, flies, lice, <HI>&amp;c</HI> turn executioners to <HI>Pharaoh</HI> and his <HI>Egyptians;</HI> worms eat up <HI>Herod:</HI> yea, man needs a league with the bea&s;ts, yea, with the very <HI>&s;tones of the field,</HI> Job. v. 13. having rea&s;on to fear, that every one that findeth him will &s;lay him. Alas! how are we fallen? How are we plunged into a gulf of mi&s;ery! The &s;un has come down on us, death has come in at our windows; our enemies have put out our two eyes, and &s;port them&s;elves with our mi&s;eries.

<P>WE have &s;een what man was, as God made him, a lovely and happy creature: let us view him now as he hath unmade him&s;elf: and we &s;hall &s;ee him a &s;inful and mi&s;erable creature. This is the &s;ad &s;tate we were brought into by the fall: a &s;tate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> black and doleful as the former was glorious; and this we commonly call <HI>The &s;tate of nature,</HI> or <HI>Man's natural &s;tate,</HI> according to that of the apo&s;tle, Eph ii. 2. <HI>And were by nature the children of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> even as others.</HI> And herein two things are to be con&s;idered; 1<HI>&s;t,</HI> The <HI>&s;infulne&s;s;</HI> 2<HI>dly,</HI> The <HI>mi&s;ery</HI> of this &s;tate, in which all the unregene|rate do live.

<P>The &s;cope and de&s;ign of the&s;e words is, to clear God's ju&s;tice, in bringing the flood on the old world. There are two particular cau&s;es of it taken notice of in the preceeding ver&s;es. (1.) Mixt marriages, ver. 2. <HI>The &s;ons of God,</HI> the po&s;terity of <HI>Seth</HI> and <HI>Enos,</HI> profe&s;&s;ors of the true religion, married with the daughters of men, the profane, cur&s;ed race of <HI>Cain.</HI> They did not carry the matter before the Lord, that he might <HI>chu&s;e for them,</HI> P&s;al. xlviii. 14. But without any re&s;pect to the <HI>will</HI> of God, they cho&s;e; not according to the rules of their faith, but of their fancy: <HI>they &s;aw that they were fair<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI>
<PB N="32" REF="045042_0029_101F7CCE0AF1DD58">
and their marriage with them, occa&s;ioned their divorce from God. This was one of the cau&s;es of the deluge, which &s;wept away the old world. Would to God all profe&s;&s;ors in our day, could plead not guilty: but tho' that &s;in brought on the deluge, yet the deluge hath not &s;wept away that &s;in; which, as of old, &s;o in our day, may ju&s;tly be looked upon, as one of the cau&s;es of the decay of religion. It was an ordinary thing among the <HI>Pagans,</HI> to change their gods, as they changed their condition into a married lot: and many &s;ad in&s;tances the Chri&s;tian world affords of the &s;ame, as if people were of <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s opinion, That religion is only for tho&s;e that have no other care upon their heads, Exod. v. 17. (2.) Great oppre&s;&s;ion, ver. 4. <HI>There was giants in the earth in tho&s;e days,</HI> men of great &s;tature, great &s;trength, and mon&s;trous wickedne&s;s, <HI>filling the earth with violence,</HI> ver. 11. But neither their &s;trength nor trea&s;ures of wickedne&s;s, could profit them in the day of wrath. Yet the gain of oppre&s;&s;ion &s;till carries many over the terror of this dreadful example. Thus much for the connexion, and what particular crimes that generation was guilty of. But every per&s;on that was &s;wept away with the flood could not be guilty of the&s;e things, and <HI>&s;hall not the Judge of all the earth do right?</HI> Therefore, in my text, there is a general indictment drawn up agai&s;t them all, <HI>The wickedne&s;s of man was great in the earth,</HI> &amp;c. And this is well in&s;tructed, for <HI>God &s;aw it.</HI> Two things are laid to their charge here.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Corruption of life, wickedne&s;s, great wickedne&s;s. I under|&s;tand this of the wickedne&s;s of their lives; for it is plainly di&s;tingui&s;hed from the wickedne&s;s of their hearts. The &s;ins of their outward con|ver&s;ation, were great in the nature of them, and greatly aggravated by their attending circum&s;tances: and this not only among tho&s;e of the race of cur&s;ed <HI>Cain,</HI> but tho&s;e of holy <HI>Seth:</HI> the wickedne&s;s of man was great. And then it is added, <HI>in the earth.</HI> (1.) To vin|dicate God's &s;everity, in that he not only cut off &s;inners, but defaced the beauty of the earth; and &s;wept off the brute creatures from it, by the deluge; that as men had &s;et the marks of their impiety, God might &s;et the marks of his indignation, <HI>on the earth.</HI> (2.) To &s;hew the heinou&s;ne&s;s of their &s;in, in making the earth, which God had &s;o adorned for the u&s;e of man, a &s;ink of &s;in, and a &s;tage whereon to act their wickedne&s;s, in defiance of heaven. God &s;aw this corruption of life, he not only knew it, and took notice of it, but he made them to know, that he did take notice of it; and that he had not for&s;aken the cur&s;t, tho' they had for&s;aken heaven.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Corruption of nature. <HI>Every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.</HI> All their wicked practices are here traced to the fountain and &s;pring-head; a corrupt heart was the &s;ource of all. The &s;oul which was made upright in all its faculties, is now wholly di&s;ordered. The heart, that was made according to God's own heart, is now the rever&s;e of it, a forge of evil imaginations, a &s;ink of inordinate affections, and a &s;tore-hou&s;e of all impiety,

Mark vii. 21, 22. Behold the heart of the natural man, as it is opened in our text. The mind is defiled; the thoughts of the heart are evil; the will and affections are defiled: the imagination of the thoughts of the heart, (<HI>i e.</HI> what&s;oever the heart frameth within it&s;elf by think|ing, &s;uch as judgment. choice, purpo&s;es, devices, de&s;ires, every inward motion); or rather, the frame of thoughts of the heart (namely, the frame, make, or mould, of the&s;e, 1 Chron. xxix. 18.) is evil. Yea, and <HI>every imagination, every frame,</HI> of his thoughts, is &s;o. The heart is ever framing &s;omething; but never one right thing: the frame of thoughts, in the heart of man, is exceeding various: yet are they never ca&s;t into a right frame: But is there not, at lea&s;t, a mixture of good in them? <HI>No,</HI> they are only evil, there is nothing in them truly good and acceptable to God: nor can any thing be &s;o that comes out of that forge: where not the Spirit of God, but <HI>the prince of the power of the air worketh,</HI> Eph. ii. 2. Whatever changes may be found in them, are only from evil to evil: for the imagination of the heart, or frame of thoughts in natural men, is evil continually, or every day: From the fir&s;t day, to the la&s;t day in this &s;tate, they are in midnight darkne&s;s; there is not a glimmering of the light of holi|ne&s;s in them; not one holy thought can ever be produced by the unholy heart. O what a vile heart is this! O what a corrupt nature is this! the tree that always brings forth fruit, but never good fruit, whatever &s;oil it be &s;et in, whatever pains be taken on it, mu&s;t natu|rally be an evil tree: and what can that heart be, whereof every imagination, every &s;et of thoughts, is only evil, and that continually? Surely that corruption is ingrained in our hearts, interwoven with our very natures, has &s;unk into the marrow of our &s;ouls; and will never be cured, but by a miracle of grace. Now &s;uch is man's heart, &s;uch is his nature, till regenerating grace change it. God that &s;earcheth the heart &s;aw man's heart was &s;o, he took &s;pecial notice of it: and the faithful and true witne&s;s cannot mi&s;take our ca&s;e; tho' we are mo&s;t apt to mi&s;take our&s;elves in this point, and generally do overlook it.</P>
<P>Beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart &s;aying. What is that to us? Let that generation, of whom the text <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;ee to that. For the Lord has left the ca&s;e of that generation on record, to be a looking gla&s;s to all after-generations; wherein they may &s;ee their own corruption of heart, and what their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> would be too, if he re&s;trained them not; for <HI>as in water face an&s;wereth to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;o the heart of man to man,</HI> Prov xxvii. 19. <HI>Adam's</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> has tra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> all men's hearts alike in this matter, Hence the apo&s;tle, Rom iii. 10. proves the corruption of the nature, hearts, and lives, of all men, from what the P&s;almi&s;t &s;ays of the wicked in his day, P&s;al. xiv. 1, 2, 3.

and all the world may become guilty before God.</HI> Had the hi&s;tory of the deluge been tran&s;mitted unto us, without the rea&s;on thereof in the text, we might thence have gathered the corruption and total depravation of man's nature: for what other quarrel could a holy and ju&s;t God have with the infants that were de&s;troyed by the flood, &s;eeing they had no actual &s;in? If we &s;aw a wi&s;e man, who having made a curious piece of work, and heartily approved of it when he gave it out of his hand, as fit for the u&s;e it was de&s;igned for ri&s;e up in wrath and break it all in pieces, when he looked on it afterwards; would we not thence conclude the frame of it had been quite marred, &s;ince it went out of his hand, and that it does not &s;erve for that u&s;e it was at fir&s;t de&s;igned for? How much more, when we &s;ee the holy and wi&s;e God, de&s;troying the work of his own hands, once &s;olemnly pro|nounced by him very good, may we conclude that the original frame thereof is utterly marred, that it cannot be mended, but it mu&s;t needs be new made, or lo&s;t altogether? Gen. vi 6, 7. <HI>And it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> him at his heart: and the Lord &s;aid, I will de&s;troy man,</HI> or blot him out, as a man doth a &s;entence out of a book, that cannot be corrected, by cutting off &s;ome letters, &s;yllables, or words, and interlining others here and there; but mu&s;t needs be wholly new framed. But did the deluge carry off this corruption of man's nature? Did it mend the matter? No it did not. God, in his holy providence, <HI>That every mouth may be &s;topped, and all the new world may become guilty before God,</HI> as well as the old, permits that corruption of nature to break out in <HI>Noah,</HI> the father of the new world, after the deluge was over. Behold him as another <HI>Adam,</HI> firming in the fruit of a tree. Gen. ix. 20, 21. He <HI>planted a vineyard, and he drank of the wine, and was drunken, and he was uncovered within his tent.</HI> More than that, God gives the &s;ame rea&s;on again&s;t a new deluge, which he gives in our text for bringing that on the world: <HI>I will not,</HI> (&s;aith he&punc;) <HI>again cur&s;e the ground any more for man's &s;ake, for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth.</HI> Gen. viii. 21. Whereby it is intimated, that there is no mending of the matter by this means; and that if he would always take the &s;ame cour&s;e with men that he had done, he would be always &s;ending deluges on the earth, &s;eeing the corruption of man's nature remains &s;till. But tho' the flood could not carry off the corruption of nature, yet it pointed at the way how it is to be done; <HI>to wit,</HI> That men mu&s;t be born of water and of the Spirit, rai&s;ed from &s;piritual death in &s;in, by the grace of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who <HI>came by water and blood;</HI> out of which a <HI>new world</HI> of &s;aints ari&s;e in regeneration&punc; even as the new <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rid of &s;inners out of the waters, where they had long lain buried (as it were) in the ark.

From the text thus explained, ari&s;eth this weighty point of DOCTRINE, which he that runs may read in it, viz <HI>That Man's nature is now wholly corrupted.</HI> Now is there a &s;ad alteration, a wonderful over|turn, in the nature of man: where, at fir&s;t, there was nothing evil; now there is nothing good.

<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Shew you how man's nature comes to be thus corrupted.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> Make application.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>That Man's Nature is corrupted.</HEAD>
<P>FIRST, I am to confirm the doctrine of the corruption of nature: to hold the gla&s;s to your eyes, wherein you may &s;ee your &s;inful nature: which, tho' God takes particular notice of it, many do quite overlook. And here we &s;hall con&s;ult, 1. <HI>God's word.</HI> 2. <HI>Men's experience</HI> and <HI>ob&s;ervation</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. For &s;cripture-proof, let us con&s;ider,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> How the &s;cripture takes particular notice of fallen <HI>Adam</HI>'s communicating his image to his po&s;terity, Gen, v. 3. <HI>Adam begat a &s;on in his own likene&s;s, after his image, and called his name Seth.</HI> Compare with this, ver 1. of that chapter, <HI>In the day that God created man, in the likene&s;s of God made be him.</HI> Behold here, how the image after which man was made, and the image after which he is begotten, are oppo&s;ed. Man was made in the likene&s;s of God: that is, a holy and righteous God made a holy and righteous creature: but fallen <HI>Adam</HI> begat a &s;on, not in the likene&s;s of God, but in his own likene&s;s; that is, corrupt &s;inful <HI>Adam</HI> begat a corrupt &s;inful &s;on. For as the image of God bore righteou&s;ne&s;s and immortality in it, as was cleared before, &s;o this image of fallen <HI>Adam</HI> bore corruption and death in it, 1 Cor. xv. 49 50. compare ver. 22. <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> in that fifth chapter of <HI>Gene&s;is,</HI> being to give us the fir&s;t bill of mortality, that ever was in the world, u&s;hers it in with this, that dying <HI>Adam</HI> begat mortals. Having &s;inned, he became mortal, according to the threat|ning; and &s;o he begat a &s;on, in his own likene&s;s, &s;inful, and therefore mortal: thus &s;in and death pa&s;&s;ed on all. Doubtle&s;s, he begat both <HI>Cain</HI> and <HI>Abel</HI> in his own likene&s;s, as well as <HI>Seth.</HI> But it is not recorded of <HI>Abel;</HI> becau&s;e he left no i&s;&s;ue behind him, and his falling the fir&s;t &s;acrifice to death in the world, was a &s;ufficient document of it: nor of <HI>Cain,</HI> to whom it might have been thought peculiar, be|cau&s;e of his mon&s;trous wickedne&s;s; and be&s;ides, all his po&s;terity was drowned in the flood: but it is recorded of <HI>Seth,</HI> becau&s;e he was the father of the holy &s;eed; and from him all mankind, &s;ince the flood, has de&s;cended, and fallen <HI>Adam</HI>'s own likene&s;s with them.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="045042_0033_101F7CDC69A03C18"><HI>Secondly,</HI> It appears from that &s;cripture text, Job xiv. 4. <HI>Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? Not one.</HI> Our fir&s;t parents were unclean, how then can we be clean? How could our immediate parents be clean? Or, how &s;hall our children be &s;o? The unclean|ne&s;s here aimed at is a &s;inful uncleanne&s;s; for it is &s;uch as makes man's days full of trouble: and it is natural, being derived from un|clean parents: <HI>Man is born of a woman,</HI> ver. 1. <HI>And how can he be clean that is born of a woman?</HI> Job xxxv. 4. An omnipotent God who&s;e power is not here challenged, could bring a clean thing out of an unclean; and did &s;o, in the ca&s;e of the Man CHRIST; but no other can. Every per&s;on that is born according to the cour&s;e of nature, is born unclean. If the root be corrupt, &s;o mu&s;t the branches be. Neither is the matter mended, tho' the parents be &s;anctified ones: for they are but holy in part, and that by grace, not by nature; and they beget their children as men, not as holy men. Wherefore, as the circumci&s;ed parent begets an uncircumci&s;ed child, and after the pure&s;t grain is &s;own, we reap corn with the chaff; &s;o the holie&s;t parents beget unholy children, and cannot communicate their grace to them, as they do their nature; which many godly parents find true, in their &s;ad experience.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Con&s;ider the confe&s;&s;ion of the P&s;almi&s;t <HI>David,</HI> P&s;al. li. 6. <HI>Behold I was &s;hapen in iniquity, and in &s;in did my mother conceive me.</HI> Here he a&s;cends from his actual &s;in, to the fountain of it, namely, corrupt nature. He was a man according to God's own heart; but from the beginning it was not &s;o with him. He was begotten in lawful marriage; but when the lump was &s;hapen in the womb, it was a &s;inful lump. Hence the corruption of nature is called <HI>the old man;</HI> being as old as our&s;elves, older than grace, even in tho&s;e that are &s;anctified from the womb.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> Hear our Lord's determination of the point, John iii. 5. <HI>That which is born of the fle&s;h, is fle&s;h.</HI> Behold the univer&s;al cor|ruption of mankind, all are fle&s;h. Not that all are frail, tho' that is a &s;ad truth too; yea, and our natural frailty is an evidence of our natural corruption; but that is not the &s;en&s;e of this text: but here is the meaning of it, all are corrupt and &s;inful, and that naturally: hence our Lord argues here, that becau&s;e they are fle&s;h, therefore they mu&s;t be born again, or el&s;e they <HI>cannot enter into the kingdom of God,</HI> ver. 3, 5. And as the corruption of our nature evidenceth the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of regeneration; &s;o the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of regeneration plainly proves the corruption of our nature: for why &s;hould a man need a &s;econd birth, if his nature were not quite marred in the fir&s;t birth? Infants mu&s;t be born again, for that is an <HI>except</HI> (John iii. 3) which admits of no conception. And therefore, they were circumci&s;ed under the Old Te&s;tament, as having <HI>the body of the &s;ins of the fle&s;h,</HI> (which is conveyed to them by natural generation) to put off, Col. ii. 11. And now by the appointment of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, they are to be baptized; which &s;ays they are unclean, and that there
<PB N="37" REF="045042_0034_101F7CDF8F74F090">
is no &s;alvation for them, but by the <HI>wa&s;hing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> Tit. iii. 5.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly</HI>&punc; Man certainly is &s;unk very low now, in compari&s;on of what he once was: God made him but a <HI>little lower than the angels:</HI> but now we find him likened to the bea&s;ts that peri&s;h. He hearkened to a brute, and is now become like one of them. Like <HI>Nebuchadnezzar,</HI> his portion (in his natural &s;tate) is with the bea&s;ts, <HI>minding only earthly things,</HI> Philip. iii. 19. Nay, brutes, in &s;ome &s;ort, have the advantage of the natural man, who is &s;unk a degree below them. He is more witle&s;s, in what concerns him mo&s;t, than the &s;tork, or the turtle, or the crane, or the &s;wallow, in what is for their intere&s;t, Jer. viii. 7. He is more &s;tupid than the ox or a&s;s. I&s;a. i. 3. I find him &s;ent to &s;chool, to learn of the ant or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">not, which having no guide, or leader to go before her; no over&s;eer or officer to compel or &s;tir her up to work; no ruler, but may do as &s;he li&s;ts, being under the do|minion of none; yet <HI>provideth her meat in the &s;ummer and harve&s;t,</HI> Prov. vi 6, 7, 8 while the natural man has all the&s;e, and yet ex|po&s;eth him&s;elf to eternal &s;tarving. Nay, more than all this, the &s;cripture holds out the natural man, not only as wanting the good qualities of tho&s;e creatures; but as a compound of the evil qualities of the wor&s;t of the creatures, in which do concenter the fiercene&s;s of the lion, the craft of the fox, the unteachablene&s;s of the wild a&s;s, the filthine&s;s of the dog and &s;wine, the poi&s;on of the a&s;p, and &s;uch like. Truth it&s;elf calls them <HI>&s;erpents, a generation of vipers;</HI> yea more, even <HI>children of the devil,</HI> Mat. iii. 7. John viii. 44. Surely then, man's nature is mi&s;erably corrupted.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, <HI>We are by nature children of wrath,</HI> Eph. ii. 3. We are worthy of, and liable to the wrath of God; and this by nature: and therefore, doubtle&s;s, we are by nature &s;inful creatures. We are condemned before we have done good or evil; under the cur&s;e, ere we know what it is. <HI>But will a lion roar in the fore&s;t while he hath no prey?</HI> Amos iii. 4. that is, Will a holy and ju&s;t God roar in his wrath again&s;t man, if he be not, by his &s;in, made a prey for wrath? No, he will not, he cannot. Let us conclude, then, that according to the word of God man's nature is a corrupt nature.</P>
<P N="2">II. If we con&s;ult experience, and ob&s;erve the ca&s;e of the world in the&s;e things that are obvious to any per&s;on that will not &s;hut his eye, again&s;t clear light; we will quickly perceive &s;uch fruits, as di&s;cover this root of bitterne&s;s: I &s;hall propo&s;e a few things, that may &s;erve to convince us in this point.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Who &s;ees not a flood of mi&s;eries overflowing the world? and whether can a man go, where he &s;hall not dip his foot, if he go not over head and ears is it? Every one at home and abroad, in city and country, in palaces, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> cottages, is groaning under &s;ome one thing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> other, ungrateful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> him.

No man's condition is

&s;o &s;oft, but there is &s;ome thorn of unea&s;ine&s;s in it. And at length death the wages of &s;in, comes after the&s;e its harbingers, and &s;weeps all away. Now, what but &s;in has opened the &s;luice? There is not a complaint nor &s;igh heard in the world, nor a tear that falls from our eye, but it is an evidence that man is fallen as a &s;tar from heaven; for <HI>God di&s;tributeth &s;orrow in his anger,</HI> Job xxi. 17 This is a plain proof of the corruption of nature: fora&s;much as tho&s;e that have not yet actually &s;inned, have their &s;hare of the&s;e &s;orrows; yea, and draw their fir&s;t breath in the world weeping, as if they knew this world, at fir&s;t &s;ight, to be a <HI>Dochim,</HI> the place of weepers. There are graves of the &s;malle&s;t, as well as of the large&s;t &s;ize, in the church-yard; and there are never wanting &s;ome in the world, who like Rachel, <HI>are weeping for their children, becau&s;e they are not,</HI> Mat. ii. 18.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Ob&s;erve how early this <HI>corruption of nature</HI> begins to appear in young ones: <HI>Solomon</HI> ob&s;erves, that <HI>even a child is known by his doings,</HI> Prov. xx. 11. It may &s;oon be di&s;cerned, what way the bias of the heart lies. Do not the children of &s;allen <HI>Adam,</HI> before they can go alone, follow their father's foot&s;teps? What a va&s;t deal of little pride, ambition, curio&s;ity, vanity, wilfulne&s;s, and aver&s;ene&s;s to good appears in them: And when they creep out of infancy, there is a nece&s;&s;ity of u&s;ing <HI>the rod of correction to drive away the fooli&s;hne&s;s that's bound in their heart,</HI> Prov. xxii 15. Which &s;hews, that if grace prevail not, the child will be as I&s;hmael, <HI>a wild a&s;s man,</HI> as the word is, Gen. xvi. 13</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Take a view of the manifold gro&s;s out-breakings of &s;in, in the world. <HI>The wickedne&s;s of man is yet great in the earth.</HI> Behold the bitter fruits of the corruption of our nature, Ho&s;. iv. 2. <HI>By &s;wearing and lying, and killing and &s;tealing, and commiting adultery, they break out,</HI> (like the breaking forth of water) <HI>and blood toucheth blood.</HI> The world is filled with filthine&s;s, and all manner of lewdne&s;s, wickedne&s;s, and profanity. Whence is this deluge of &s;in on the earth, but from the breaking up of the fountains of <HI>the great deep,</HI> the heart of man; <HI>out of which proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders, thefts. covetou&s;ne&s;s, wickedne&s;s,</HI> &amp;c. Mark vii, 21, 22. Ye will, it may be, thank God with a whole heart, that ye are not like the&s;e other men: and indeed ye have better rea&s;on for it than, I fear, ye are aware of; for, <HI>as in water, face an&s;wereth to face, &s;o the heart of man to man,</HI> Prov. xxvii. 19. As looking into clear water, ye &s;ee your own face; &s;o looking into your heart, ye may &s;ee other men's there: and looking into other men's, in them ye may &s;ee your own. So that the mo&s;t vile and profane wretches that are in the world &s;hould &s;erve you for a looking gla&s;s; in which you ought to di&s;cern the corruption of your own nature: and if you do &s;o, ye would, with a heart truly touched, thank God, and not your&s;elves, indeed, that ye are <HI>not as other men,</HI> in your lives; &s;eeing the corruption of nature is the &s;ame in you, as in them.</P>

The world is a wilder|ne&s;s, where the cleare&s;t fire men can carry about with them, will not fright away the wild bea&s;ts that inhabit it, (and that becau&s;e they are men, and not brutes) but one way or other they will be wounded. Since <HI>Cain</HI> &s;hed the blood of <HI>Abel,</HI> the earth has been turned into a &s;laughter-hou&s;e; and the chace has been continued &s;ince <HI>Nimrod</HI> began his hunting; on the earth, as in the &s;ea, the greater &s;till devouring the le&s;&s;er.

The&s;e violent heats among <HI>Adam</HI>'s &s;ons, &s;peak the whole body to be di&s;tempered, the whole head to be &s;ick, and the whole heart faint. They &s;urely proceed from an inward cau&s;e, James vi. 1. <HI>Lu&s;ts that war in our members.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> Con&s;ider the nece&s;&s;ity of human laws, fenced with terrors and &s;everities; to which we may apply what the apo&s;tle &s;ays, 1 Tim. i. 9. That <HI>the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawle&s;s and di&s;obedient, for the ungodly and for &s;inners,</HI> &amp;c. Man was made for &s;ociety: and God him&s;elf &s;aid of the fir&s;t man, when he had created him, that it was <HI>not meet that he &s;hould be alone:</HI> yet the ca&s;e is &s;uch now, that, in &s;ociety, he mu&s;t be hedged in with thorns. And that from hence we may the better &s;ee the corruption of man's nature, con&s;ider, (1.) Every man naturally loves to be at full liberty him&s;elf; to have his own will for his law; and if he would follow his natural inclinations, would vote him&s;elf out of the reach of all laws, divine and human. And hence &s;ome (the power of who&s;e hands has been an&s;werable to their natural inclination) have indeed made them&s;elves ab&s;olute, and above laws; agreeable to man's mon&s;trous de&s;ign at fir&s;t, to be as gods, Gen. iii. 5. Yet, (2.) There is no man that would willingly adventure to live in a lawle&s;s &s;ociety: and therefore, even pirates and robbers have laws among them&s;elves, tho' the whole &s;ociety ca&s;t off all re&s;pect to law and right. Thus men di&s;cover them&s;elves to be con&s;cious of the corruption of nature; not daring to tru&s;t one another, but upon &s;ecurity. (3.) How dangerous &s;oever it is to break thro' the hedge: yet the violence of lu&s;t makes many adventure daily to run the ri&s;k. They will not only &s;acrifice their credit and con&s;cience, which la&s;t is highly e&s;teem'd in the world; but for the plea&s;ure of a few moments, immediately &s;ucceeded with terror from within, they will lay them&s;elves open to a violent death by the laws of the land wherein they live. (4.) The laws are often made to yield to men's lu&s;ts. Sometimes whole &s;ocieties run into &s;uch ex|travagancies, that like a company of pri&s;oners, they break off their fetters, and put their guards to flight; and the voice of laws cannot be heard for the noi&s;e of arms. And &s;eldom is there a time wherein
<PB N="40" REF="045042_0037_101F7CEA8C33BFB0">
there are not &s;ome per&s;ons &s;o great and daring, that the laws dare not look their impetuous lu&s;ts in the face; which made <HI>David</HI> &s;ay in the ca&s;e of <HI>Joab,</HI> who had murdered <HI>Abner, Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e men, the &s;on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of</HI> Zeruiah, <HI>be too hard for me,</HI> 2 Sam iii. 39 Lu&s;ts &s;ometimes grow too &s;trong for laws, &s;o that the law is &s;lacked, as the pul&s;e of a dying man, Hab. i. 3, 4. (5.) Con&s;ider what nece&s;&s;ity often appears of ammending old laws, and making new ones; which have their ri&s;e from new crimes that man's nature is very fruitful of. There would be no need of mending the hedge, if men were not like unruly bea&s;ts, &s;till breaking it down. It is a&s;toni&s;hing to &s;ee&punc; what figure the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> who were &s;eparated unto God, from among all the nations of the earth do make in their hi&s;tory; what horrible confu&s;ions were among them, when there was no king in <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> as you may &s;ee, in the xviii. xix. xx. and xxi. chapters of <HI>Judges:</HI> how hard it was to reform them, when they had the be&s;t of magi&s;trates: and how quickly they turned a&s;ide again, when they got wicked rulers. I cannot but think, that one grand de&s;ign of that &s;acred hi&s;tory, was to di&s;cover the corruption of man's nature, the ab&s;olute need of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> and his grace: and that we ought in the reading of it, to improve it to that end. How cutting is that word, the Lord has to <HI>Samuel,</HI> concerning <HI>Saul,</HI> 1 Sam. ix. 17. <HI>The &s;ame &s;hall reign over</HI> (or, as the word is, <HI>&s;hall re&s;train) my people.</HI> O the corruption of man's nature! the awe and dread of the God of heaven re&s;trains them not: but they mu&s;t have gods on the earth to do it <HI>to put them to &s;hame,</HI> Judges xviii. 7.</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly,</HI> Con&s;ider the remains of that natural corruption in the &s;aints. Tho' grace has entered, yet corruption is not quite expelled: tho' they have got the new creature, yet much of the old corrupt nature remains: and the&s;e &s;truggle together within them, as the twins in <HI>Rebekah</HI>'s womb, Gal. v. 17. They &s;aid it pre&s;ent with them at all times, and in all places, even in the mo&s;t retired corners. If a man have an ill neighbour, he may remove; if he have an ill &s;ervant, he may put him away at the term: if a bad yoke fellow, he may &s;ometimes leave the hou&s;e, and be free of mole&s;tation that way. But &s;hould the &s;aint go into a wilderne&s;s, or &s;et up his tent in &s;ome remote rock in the &s;ea, where never foot of man, bea&s;t, nor fowl had touched, there will it be with him. Should he be, with <HI>Paul,</HI> caught up to the third heavens, it &s;hall come back with him, 2 Cor xii. 7. It followeth him as the &s;hadow doth the body: it makes a blot in the faire&s;t line he can draw. It is like the fig-tree in the wall, which, how nearly &s;oever it was cut, yet &s;till grow till the wall was thrown down; for the roots of it are fixed in the heart, while the &s;aint is in the world, as with bands of iron and bra&s;s. It is e&s;pecially active when he would do good, Rom. vii. 21. then the fowls come down upon the carca&s;es. Hence often in holy duties, the &s;pirit even of a &s;aint (as it were) evaporates: and he is lef<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ere he is aware, like <HI>Michael,</HI> with an image in the bed, in&s;tead of an hu&s;band. I need not &s;tand to prove th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

remains of the corruption of nature in the godly, to them&s;elves; for they groan under it; and to prove it to them, were to hold out a candle to let men &s;ee the &s;un: and as for the wicked, they are ready to account mole-hills in the &s;aint, as big as mountains; if not to reckon them all hypocrites. But con&s;ider the&s;e few things on this head. (1.) <HI>If it be thus in the green tree, how mu&s;t it be in the dry?</HI> The &s;aints are not born &s;aints; but made &s;o by the power of regenerat|i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> grace. Have they got a new nature, and yet &s;o much of the old remains with them? How great mu&s;t that corruption be in others, where it is altogether unmixed with grace? (2.) The &s;aints groan under the remains of it as a heavy burden? hear the Apo&s;tle, Rom. vii. 24. <HI>O wretched man that I am! Who &s;hall deliver me from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of this death?</HI> What tho' the carnal man lives at ea&s;e and quiet, and the corruption of nature is not his burden: is he therefore free from it? No, no; only he is dead, and feels not the &s;inking weight. Many a groan is heard from a &s;ick bed; but never one from a grave. In the &s;aint, as in the &s;ick man, there is a mighty &s;truggle; life and death &s;triving for the ma&s;tery: but in the natural man, as in the dead corp&s;e, there is no noi&s;e; becau&s;e death bears full &s;way. (3.) The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> man re&s;i&s;ts the old corrupt nature: he &s;trives to mortify it, yet it remains: he endeavours to &s;tarve it, and by that means to weaken it; yet it is active: how mu&s;t it &s;pread then, and &s;trengthen it&s;elf in that &s;oul, where it is not &s;tarved but fed? And this is the ca&s;e of all unregenerate, who <HI>make provi&s;ion for the fle&s;h, to fulfil the lu&s;ts thereof.</HI> If the garden of the diligent afford him new work daily, in cutting off and rooting up; &s;urely that of the &s;luggard mu&s;t needs be all grown over with thorns.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> I &s;hall add but one ob&s;erve more, and that is, That in every m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n naturally the image of fallen <HI>Adam</HI> does appear. Some children, by their features and lineaments of their face, do, as it were, father them&s;elves: and thus we do re&s;emble our fir&s;t parents. Every one of us bear the image and impre&s;s of their fall upon him: and to evince the truth of this, I do appeal to the con&s;ciences of all, in the&s;e following particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>&s;t,</HI> Is not a &s;inful curio&s;ity natural to us? And is not this a print of <HI>Adam</HI>'s image? Gen. iii. 6. Is not men naturally much more de&s;irous to know new things, than to practi&s;e old known truths? How like to old <HI>Adam</HI> do we look in this, itching after novelties, and di&s;|reli&s;hing old &s;olid doctrines? We &s;eek after knowledge rather than holine&s;s; and &s;tudy mo&s;t to know the&s;e things, which are lea&s;t edify|ing. Our wild and roving fancies need a bridle to curb them, while good &s;olid affections mu&s;t be quickened and &s;purred up</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly,</HI> If the LORD, by his holy law and wi&s;e providence do put a re&s;traint upon us, to keep us back from any thing&punc; doth not that re&s;traint whet the edge of our natural inclinations, and make us &s;o much the keener in our de&s;ires: And in this do we not betray it plainly that we are <HI>Adam</HI>'s children. Gen. iii. 2, 3, 6. I think this
<PB N="42" REF="045042_0039_101F7CEE0BC33EE8">
cannot be denied: for daily ob&s;ervation evinceth, that it is a natural principle; that <HI>&s;tolen waters are &s;weet, and bread eaten in &s;ecret, is plea&s;ant.</HI> Prov. ix. 17. The very heathens are convinced, that man was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with this &s;pirit of contradiction, tho' they knew not the &s;pring of it. How often do men give them&s;elves the loo&s;e in the&s;e things, in which, if God had left them at liberty, they would have bound up them&s;elves! but corrupt nature takes a plea&s;ure in the very jumping over the hedge. And is it not a repeating of our father's folly, that men will rather climb for forbidden fruit, than gather what is &s;haken off the true of good providence to them, when they have God's expre&s;s allowance for it!</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly,</HI> Which of all the children of <HI>Adam</HI> is not naturally di&s;po&s;ed to hear the <HI>in&s;truction that cau&s;eth to err?</HI> And was not this the rock our fir&s;t parents &s;plit upon? Gen. iii. 4, 6.

<P N="4">4<HI>thly,</HI> Do not the eyes in our head often blind the eyes of the mind? And was not this the very ca&s;e of our fir&s;t parents? Gen iii. 6. Man is never more blind than when he is looking on the objects that are plea&s;ant to &s;en&s;e. Since the eyes of our fir&s;t parents were opened to the forbidden fruit, men's eyes have been the gates of de&s;truction to their &s;ouls; at which impure imaginations and &s;inful de&s;ires have entred the heart, to the wounding of the &s;oul, wa&s;ting of the con&s;ci|ence, and bringing di&s;mal effects &s;ometimes on whole &s;ocieties, as in <HI>Achan</HI>'s ca&s;e, <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> vii. 21. Holy <HI>Job</HI> was aware of this danger, from the&s;e two little rowling bodies, which a very &s;mall &s;plinter of wood will make u&s;ele&s;s; &s;o as (with that King who dur&s;t not, with his ten thou&s;and, meet him that came with twenty thou&s;and again&s;t him, Luke xiv. 31, 32.) he &s;endeth and de&s;ireth conditions of peace, Job xxxi. 1. <HI>I have made a covenant with mine eyes,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="5">5<HI>thly,</HI> Is it not natural for us, to care for the body, even at the expence of the &s;oul? This was one ingredient in the &s;in of our fir&s;t parents, Gen. iii. 6. O how happy might we be, if we were but at half the pains about our &s;ouls, that we be&s;tow upon our bodies! if that que&s;tion, <HI>What mu&s;t I do to be &s;aved?</HI> (Acts xvi. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">0.) did run but near as oft through our minds, as tho&s;e other que&s;tions do, <HI>What &s;hall we eat? What &s;hall we drink? Wherewithal &s;hall we be clothed?</HI> Mat. vi. 21. many a (now) hopele&s;s ca&s;e would turn very hopeful.

ver. 13. If the con&s;ent of the fle&s;h be got to an action the con&s;ent of the con&s;cience is rarely waited for: yea, the body is often &s;erved, when the con&s;cience has entred a di&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P N="6">6<HI>thly,</HI> Is not every one by nature di&s;content with his pre&s;ent lot in the world; or with &s;ome one thing or other in it? This al&s;o was <HI>Adam</HI>'s ca&s;e, Gen. iii. 5, 6. Some one thing is always mi&s;&s;ing; &s;o that man is a creature given to changes. And if any doubt of this, let them look over all their enjoyments; and after a review of them, li&s;ten to their own hearts, and they will hear a &s;ecret murmuring for want of &s;omething: tho' perhaps, if they con&s;idered the matter aright, they would &s;ee that it is better for them, to want, than to have that &s;omething. Since the hearts of our fir&s;t parents flew out at their eyes, on the forbidden fruit, and a night of darkne&s;s was thereby brought on the world; their po&s;terity have a natural di&s;ea&s;e, which <HI>Solomon</HI> calls, <HI>The wandring of the de&s;ires,</HI> (or, as the word is, <HI>The walking of the &s;oul,</HI>) Eccl. vi 9. This is a &s;ort of a diabolical trance, wherein the &s;oul traver&s;eth the world; feeds it&s;elf with a thou&s;and airy nothings: &s;natcheth at this and the other created excellency, in imagination and de&s;ire: goes here and there, and every-where, except where it &s;hould go. And the &s;oul is never cured of this di&s;ea&s;e, till overcoming grace bring it back, to take up its everla&s;ting re&s;t in God thro' Chri&s;t: but till this be, if man were &s;et again in paradi&s;e, the garden of the Lord; all the plea&s;ures there would not keep him from looking, yea, and leaping over the hedge a &s;econd time.</P>
<P N="7">7<HI>thly,</HI> Are we not far more ea&s;ily impre&s;&s;ed and influenced by evil coun&s;els and examples, than by tho&s;e that are good? You will &s;ee this was the ruin of <HI>Adam,</HI> Gen iii. 6 Evil example, to this day, is one of <HI>Satan</HI>'s ma&s;ter devices to ruin men. And tho' we have by nature, more of the fox than of the lamb; yet that ill property &s;ome ob&s;erve in this creature, <HI>viz.</HI> That if one lamb &s;kip into a water, the re&s;t that are near will &s;uddenly follow, may be ob&s;erved al&s;o in the di&s;po&s;ition of the children of men; to whom it is very natural to embrace an evil way, becau&s;e they &s;ee others upon it before them. Ill example has frequently the force of a violent &s;tream to carry us over plain duty: but e&s;pecia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y, if the example be given by tho&s;e we bear a great affection to; our affection, in that ca&s;e blinds our judgment; and what we would abhor in others, is complied with to humour them. And nothing is more plain, than that generally men chu&s;e rather to do what the mo&s;t do, than what the be&s;t do.</P>
<P N="8">8<HI>thly,</HI> Who of all <HI>Adam</HI>'s &s;ons needs be taught the art of <HI>&s;owing fig-leaves together,</HI> to cover their nakedne&s;s? Gen. iii. 7. When we have ruined our&s;elves, and made our&s;elves naked, to our &s;hame; we naturally &s;eek to help our&s;elves by our&s;elves: and many poor &s;hifts are fallen upon, as &s;illy and in&s;ignificant as <HI>Adam</HI>'s fig-leaves. What pains are men at, to cover their &s;in from their own con&s;ciences, and draw all the fair colours upon it that they can? And when once con|victions are fa&s;tened upon them, &s;o that they cannot but &s;ee them&s;elves
<PB N="44" REF="045042_0041_101F7CF75BE0AC48">
naked; it is as natural for them to attempt to &s;pin a cover to it out of their own bowels, as for fi&s;hes to &s;wim in the waters, or birds to fly in the air. Therefore, the fir&s;t que&s;tion of the convinced is, <HI>What &s;hall we do?</HI> Acts ii. 27. How &s;hall we qualify our&s;elves? What &s;hall we perform? Not minding that the new creature is God's own workman&s;hip (or deed, Eph. ii. 10.) more than <HI>Adam</HI> thought of being clothed with &s;kins of &s;acrifices, Gen. iii. 21.</P>
<P N="9">9<HI>thly,</HI> Do not <HI>Adam</HI>'s children naturally follow his foot&s;teps, in hiding them&s;elves from the pre&s;ence of the LORD, Gen. iii. 8. We are every whit as blind in this matter as he was, who thought to hide him&s;elf from the pre&s;ence of God among the &s;hady trees of the garden. We are very apt to promi&s;e our&s;elves more &s;ecurity in a &s;ecret &s;in, than in one that is openly committed. <HI>The eye of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, &s;aying, No eye &s;hall &s;ee me,</HI> Job xxiv. 15. And men will freely do that in &s;ecret, which they would be a&s;hamed to do in the pre&s;ence of a child; as if darkne&s;s could hide from an all-&s;eeing God. Are we not naturally carele&s;s of communion with God; ay, and aver&s;e to it? Never was there any communion betwixt God and <HI>Adam</HI>'s children&punc; where the Lord him&s;elf had not the fir&s;t word. If he would let them alone, they would never inquire after him. I&s;a. lvii. 16. <HI>I hide me.</HI>&mdash;Did he &s;eek after a hiding God? Very far from it.&mdash;<HI>He went on in the way of his heart.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10<HI>thly,</HI> How loath are men to confe&s;s &s;in, to take guilt and &s;hame to them&s;elves? And was it not thus in the ca&s;e before us? Gen. iii. 10. <HI>Adam</HI> confe&s;&s;eth his nakedne&s;s, which he could not get denied; but not one word he &s;ays of his &s;ins: here was the rea&s;on of it, he would fain have hid it if he could. It is as natural for us to hide &s;in, as to commit it. Many &s;ad in&s;tances thereof we have in this world; but a far clearer proof of it we &s;hall get at the day of judgment, the day in which <HI>God will judge the &s;ecrets of men,</HI> Rom. ii. 16. Many a foul mouth will then be &s;een, which is now <HI>wiped, and &s;aith, I have done no wickedne&s;s,</HI> Prov. xxx. 20.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> Is it not natural for us to extenuate our &s;in, and transfer the guilt upon others? And when God examined our guilty fir&s;t parents, did not <HI>Adam</HI> lay the blame on the woman? And did not the woman lay the blame on the &s;erpent? Gen. iii. 12, 13. Now <HI>Adam</HI>'s children need not be taught this helli&s;h policy; for before they can well &s;peak, (if they cannot get the fact denied) they will cunningly li&s;pout &s;omething to le&s;&s;en their fault, and lay the blame upon another. Nay, &s;o natural is this to men, that in the greate&s;t of &s;ins, they will lay the fault upon God him&s;elf; they will bla&s;pheme his holy providence, under the mi&s;taken name of misfortune or ill luck, and thereby lay the blame of their &s;in at heaven's door. And was not this one of <HI>Adam</HI>'s tricks after his fall? Gen. iii. 12. <HI>And the man &s;aid, the woman whom thou ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;t to be with me, &s;he gave me of the tree, and I did eat.</HI> Ob&s;erve the order of the &s;peech.

This looks as if <HI>Adam</HI> would have fathered an ill de&s;ign upon the Lord, in giving him this gift. And after all, there is a new demon&s;trative here, before the &s;entence is compleat: he &s;ays not, <HI>The woman gave me,</HI> but <HI>the woman &s;he gave me,</HI> emphatically, as if he had &s;aid, <HI>She, even She gave me of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">.</HI> This much for his apology. But his con|fe&s;&s;ion is quickly over, in one word, (is he &s;poke it) <HI>and I did eat.</HI> And there is nothing here to point to him&s;elf, and as little to &s;hew what he had eaten. How natural is his black art to <HI>Adam</HI>'s po&s;terity? He that runs may read it. So univer&s;ally does <HI>Solomon</HI>'s ob&s;erve hold true, Prov. xvii. 3. <HI>The fooli&s;hne&s;s of men perverteth his ways, and his heart fretteth again&s;t the Lord</HI> Let us then call fallen Adam, <HI>father;</HI> let us not deny the relation, &s;eeing we bear his image.</P>
<P>And now to &s;hut up this point, &s;ufficiently confirmed by concurring evidence from the Lord's word, our own experience and ob&s;ervation; let us be per&s;uaded to believe the doctrine of the corruption of our nature: and to look to the &s;acred <HI>Adam,</HI> the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, for the application of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> blood, to remove the guilt of this &s;in; and for the efficacy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> his holy Spirit, to make us new creatures, knowing that <HI>except we be born <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gain, we cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Of the Corruption of the Under&s;tanding.</HEAD>
<P>SECONDLY, I proceed to inquire into the corruption of nature, in the &s;everal parts thereof. But who can comprehend it? Who can take the exact dimen&s;ion of it, in its breadth, length, height, and depth? <HI>The heart is deceitful above all things, and de&s;perately wicked: Who can kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w it?</HI> Jer. xiii. 9. However, we may quickly perceive as much of it, as may be matter of deepe&s;t humiliation, and may di&s;|cover to us the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of regeneration. Man in his natu|ral &s;tate is altogether corrupt. Both &s;oul and body are polluted, as the apo&s;tle proves at large, Rom. iii. 10,&mdash;18. As for the &s;oul, the natural corruption has &s;pread it&s;elf through all the faculties thereof&punc; and is to be found in the <HI>under&s;tanding,</HI> the <HI>will,</HI> the <HI>affections,</HI> the <HI>con&s;cience,</HI> and the <HI>memory.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. The <HI>Under&s;tanding,</HI> that leading faculty, is de&s;poiled of it's primitive glory, and covered over with confu&s;ion. We have fallen

into the hands of our grand adver&s;ary, as <HI>Sam&s;on</HI> into the hands of the <HI>Phili&s;tines,</HI> and are deprived of our two eyes. <HI>There is none that under&s;tandeth,</HI> Rom. iii. 11. <HI>Mind and con&s;cience are defiled,</HI> Tit. i. 15. The natural man's apprehen&s;ion of divine things is corrupt, P&s;al. l. 21. <HI>Thou thoughte&s;t that I was altogether &s;uch an one as thy&s;elf.</HI> His judg|ment is corrupt, and cannot be otherways, &s;eeing his eye is evil: and therefore the &s;criptures, that &s;hew that men did all wrong, &s;ays, <HI>Every one did that which was right in his own eyes,</HI> Judges xvii. 7. and xxi. 25. And his imaginations, or rea&s;onings mu&s;t be ca&s;t down, by the power of the word, being of a piece with his judgment, 2 Cor. x. 5 But to point out this <HI>corruption</HI> of the <HI>mind</HI> or <HI>under&s;tanding</HI> more particularly, let the&s;e following things be con&s;idered.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> There is a natural weakne&s;s in the minds of men, with re&s;pect to &s;piritual things. The apo&s;tle determines concerning every one that is not endued with the graces of the Spirit, <HI>That he is blind, and cannot &s;ee afar off,</HI> 2 Pet. i. 9. Hence the Spirit of God in the &s;crip|tures, clothes, as it were, divine truths with earthly figures, even as parents teach their children, u&s;ing &s;imilitudes, Ho&s;. xii. 10. Which, tho' it doth not cure, yet doth evidence this natural weakne&s;s in the minds of men. But we want not plain proofs of it from experience. As, (1.) How hard a ta&s;k is it to teach many people the common principles of our holy religion, and to make truths &s;o plain as they may under&s;tand them? Here there mu&s;t be <HI>precept upon precept, precept upon precept, line upon line, line upon line,</HI> I&s;a. xxviii. 9. Try the &s;ame per&s;ons in other things, they &s;hall be found <HI>wi&s;er in their generation than the children of light.</HI> They under&s;tand their work and bu&s;ine&s;s in the world, as well as their neighbours; tho' they be very &s;tupid and unteachable in the matters of God. Tell them how they may advance their worldly wealth, or how they may gratify their lu&s;ts, and they will quickly under&s;tand the&s;e things; tho' it is very hard to make them know how their &s;ouls may be &s;aved; or how their hearts may find re&s;t in Je&s;us Chri&s;t. (2.) Con&s;ider the&s;e who have many advantages, beyond the common gang of mankind; who have had the benefit of good education and in&s;truction; yea, and are ble&s;t with the light of grace in that mea&s;ure, wherein it is di&s;tributed to the &s;aints on earth: yet how &s;mall a portion have they of the knowledge of divine things! What ignorance and confu&s;ion do &s;till remain in their minds! How often are they mired, even in the matter of practical truths, and &s;peak as a child in the&s;e things. It is a pitiful weakne&s;s that we cannot perceive the things which God has revealed to us: and it mu&s;t needs be a &s;inful weakne&s;s, &s;ince the law of God requires us to know and believe them. (3.) What dangerous mi&s;takes are to be found among&s;t men, in their concerns of greate&s;t weight! what woful delu&s;ions prevail over them! do we not often &s;ee tho&s;e, who otherwi&s;e, are the wi&s;e&s;t of men, the mo&s;t notorious fools, with re&s;pect to their &s;oul's intere&s;t, Matth. xi. 25. <HI>Thou ha&s;t hid the&s;e things from the wi&s;e and prudent.</HI> Many that are eagle-eyed in the
<PB N="47" REF="045042_0044_101F7D00F3D7FCE8">
trifles of time, are like owls and bats in the light of life. Nay truly, the life of every natural man is but one continued dream and delu&s;ion: out of which he never awakes, till either by a new light darted from heaven into his &s;oul, he come to him&s;elf, Luke xv. 17. or, <HI>in hell he lift up his eyes,</HI> chap. xvi 24. And therefore in &s;cripture account, be he never &s;o wi&s;e, he is a fool and a &s;imple one.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Man's under&s;tanding is naturally overwhelmed with gro&s;s darkne&s;s in &s;piritual things. Man, at the in&s;tigation of the devil, attempting to break out a new light in his mind, (Gen. iii. 5.) in&s;tead of that, br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ke up the doors of the bottomle&s;s pit: &s;o, as by the &s;moak thereof, he was buried in darkne&s;s. When God at fir&s;t had made man, his mind was a lamp of light: but now when he comes to make him over again in regeneration, he finds it darkne&s;s, Eph. v. 8. <HI>Ye were &s;ometimes darkne&s;s.</HI> Sin has clo&s;ed the windows of the &s;oul, darkne&s;s is over all that region. It is the land of darkne&s;s and &s;hadow of death, where the light is as darkne&s;s. The prince of darkne&s;s reigns there, and nothing but the works of darkne&s;s are framed there. We are both &s;piritually blind, and cannot be re&s;tored without a miracle of grace. This is thy ca&s;e, who&s;oever thou art, if thou art not born again. And that you may be convinced in this matter, take tho&s;e following evidences of it.</P>
<P><HI>Evidence</HI> 1. The darkne&s;s that was upon the face of the world before, and at the time when Chri&s;t came, ari&s;ing as <HI>the &s;un of righte|ou&s;ne&s;s</HI> upon the earth. When <HI>Adam</HI> by his &s;in had lo&s;t that primitive light wherewith he was endued in his creation, it plea&s;ed God to make a gracious revelation of his mind and will to him, touching the way of &s;alvation, Gen iii. 15. This was handed down by him, and other godly fathers, before the flood: yet the natural darkne&s;s of the mind of man prevailed &s;o far again&s;t that revelation, as to carry off all &s;en&s;e of true religion from the old world, except what remained in <HI>Noah</HI>'s family, which was pre&s;erved in the ark. After the flood, as men multiplied on the earth, the natural darkne&s;s of mind prevails again, and the light decays, till it died out among the generality of mankind, and is pre&s;erved only among the po&s;terity of <HI>Shem.</HI> And even with them it was well near its &s;etting, when God called <HI>Abraham</HI> from <HI>&s;erving other gods,</HI> Jo&s;h. xxiv. 15. God gives <HI>Abraham</HI> a more clear and full revelation, and he communicates the &s;ame to his family, Gen. xvii. 19. yet the natural darkne&s;s wears it out at length, &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e that it was pre&s;erved among the po&s;terity of <HI>Jacob.</HI> They being carried down into <HI>Egypt,</HI> that darkne&s;s prevailed &s;o, as to leave them very little &s;en&s;e of true religion: and a new revelation behoved to be made them in the wilderne&s;s. And many a cloud of darkne&s;s got above that, now and then, during the time from <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> to CHRIST. When CHRIST came, the world was divided into <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles.</HI> The <HI>Jews,</HI> and the true light with them, were within an inclo&s;ure, P&s;al. cxliii. 19, 20. Betwixt them and the <HI>Gentile</HI> world, there was a partition wall of GOD's making, namely, the ceremonial law; and
<PB N="48" REF="045042_0045_101F7D02C4404990">
upon that there was reared up another of man's own making, namely, a rooted enmity betwixt the parties, Eph ii. 14, 15. If we look abroad without the inclo&s;ure, (and except tho&s;e pro&s;elytes of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> who, by means of &s;ome rays of light breaking forth unto them from within the inclo&s;ure, having renounced idolatry, wor&s;hipped the true God, but did not conform to the <HI>Mo&s;aical</HI> rites) we &s;ee noth|ing but <HI>dark places of the earth, full of the habitations of cru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lty,</HI> P&s;al. lxxiv. 20. Gro&s;s darkne&s;s covered the face of the <HI>Gentile</HI> world; and the way of &s;alvation was utterly unknown among them. They were drowned in &s;uper&s;tition and idolatry; and had multiplied their idols to &s;uch a va&s;t number, that above thirty thou&s;and are reckoned to have been wor&s;hipped by tho&s;e of <HI>Europe</HI> alone. Whatever wi&s;dom was among their Philo&s;ophers, <HI>the world by</HI> that <HI>wi&s;dom knew not God,</HI> 1 Cor. 1 21. and all their re&s;earches in religion were but groping in the dark, Acts x<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">. 27. If we look within the inclo&s;ure, and, except a few that were groaning and waiting for the Con&s;olation of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> we will &s;ee a gro&s;s darkne&s;s on the face of that gene|ration. Tho' <HI>to them were committed the oracles of God;</HI> yet they were mo&s;t corrupt in their doctrine Their traditions were multi|plied; but the knowledge of the&s;e things wherein the life of re|ligion lies, was lo&s;t: <HI>Ma&s;ters of I&s;rael</HI> knew not the nature and nece&s;&s;ity of regeneration, John iii. 10. Their religion was to build on their birth privilege, as children of <HI>Abraham,</HI> Matth. iii. 9. to glory in their circumci&s;ion, and other external ordinances, Philip. iii. 2, 3. And to re&s;t in the law, (Rom. ii. 17.) after they had, by their fal&s;e glo&s;&s;es, cut it &s;o &s;hort, as they might go well near to the fulfilling of it, Matth. v.</P>
<P>Thus was darkne&s;s over the face of the world, when CHRIST <HI>the true Light</HI> came into it: and &s;o is darkne&s;s over every &s;oul, till he, as the <HI>Day-&s;tar,</HI> ari&s;e in the heart. The former is an evidence of the latter. What, but the natural darkne&s;s of men's minds, could &s;till thus wear out the light of external revelation in a matter upon which eternal happine&s;s did depend? Men did not forget the way of pre&s;erving their lives: but how quickly did they lo&s;e the knowledge of the way of &s;alvation of their &s;ouls; which are of infinite more weight and worth! when patriarchs and prophets teaching was ineffectual, men behoved to be taught of GOD him&s;elf; who alone can open the eyes of the under&s;tanding. But, that it might appear, that the corruption of man's mind lay deeper than to be cured by mere external revelation; there were but very few converted by CHRIST's preaching, <HI>who &s;poke as never man &s;pok<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> John xii. 37, 38. The great cure on the generation re|mained to be performed, by the Spirit accompanying the preaching of the apo&s;tles; who, according to the promi&s;e, (John xlv. 12.) were to do great works. And if we look to the miracles wrought by our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, we will find, that by applying the remedy to the &s;oul, for the cure of bodily di&s;tempers, (as in the ca&s;e of
<PB N="49" REF="045042_0046_101F7D06E2E8B0F8">
<HI>the man &s;ick of the pal&s;y,</HI> Matth. ix. 2.) he plainly di&s;covered, that it was his main errand into the world to cur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the di&s;ea&s;es of the &s;oul. I find a miracle wrought upon one that was born <HI>blind,</HI> performed in &s;uch a way, as &s;eems to have been de&s;igned to let the world &s;ee in it, as in a gla&s;s, their ca&s;e and cure, John ix. 6. <HI>He made clay, and anointed the eyes of the blind man, with the clay.</HI> What could more fitly repre&s;ent the blindne&s;s of men's minds, than eyes clo&s;ed up with earth? I&s;a vi. 1 <HI>&s;hut their eyes;</HI> &s;hut them up by anointing or <HI>ca&s;ting them with mortar,</HI> as the word would bear. And Chap. xliv. 18. <HI>he hath &s;hut their eyes;</HI> the word properly &s;ignifies, <HI>he hath plai&s;tered their eyes;</HI> as the hou&s;e in which the lepro&s;y had been, was to be plai&s;tered, Lev. xiv. 42. Thus the Lord's word di&s;covers the de&s;ign of that &s;trange work; and by it &s;hews us, that the eyes of our under|&s;tanding are naturally &s;hut. Then the blind man mu&s;t go and wa&s;h off this clay in the pool of <HI>Siloam;</HI> no other water will &s;erve this purpo&s;e. If that pool had not repre&s;ented him, whom the Father &s;ent into the world, <HI>to open the blind eyes,</HI> (I&s;a. xlii. 7.) I think the Evangeli&s;t had not given us the interpretation of the name, which he &s;ays, &s;ignifies, <HI>&s;ent,</HI> John ix. 7. And &s;o we may conclude, that the natural darkne&s;s of our minds is &s;uch, as there is no cure for; but from the blood and Spirit of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who&s;e eye-&s;alve, only can make us &s;ee, Rev. iii. 18.</P>
<P><HI>Evid.</HI> 2. Every natural man's heart and life is a ma&s;s of darkne&s;s, di&s;order and confu&s;ion; how refined &s;oever he appear in the &s;ight of men. <HI>For we our&s;elves al&s;o,</HI> &s;aith the apo&s;tle Paul, <HI>were &s;ometimes fooli&s;h, di&s;obedient, deceived, &s;erving divers lu&s;ts and plea&s;ures,</HI> Tit. iii. 3. and yet at that time, which this text looks to, he was <HI>blamele&s;s, touch|ing the righteou&s;ne&s;s which is in the law,</HI> Phil. iii. 6. This is a plain evidence that <HI>the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ye is evil, the whole body being full of darkne&s;s,</HI> Mat. vi. 23. The unrenewed part of mankind is rambling through the world. like &s;o many blind men; who will neither take a guide, nor can guide them&s;elves; and therefore are falling over this and the other precipice, into de&s;truction. Some are running after their covet|iou&s;ne&s;s, till they be pierced through with many &s;orrows; &s;ome &s;tick|ing in the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re of &s;en&s;uality; others da&s;hing them&s;elves on the rock of pride and &s;elf-conceit; every one &s;tumbling on &s;ome one &s;tone of &s;tumbling or other: all of them are running them&s;elves upon the &s;word-point of ju&s;tice, while they eagerly follow, whither their un|mortified pa&s;&s;ions and affections lead them; and while &s;ome are lying alone in the way, others are coming up, and falling headlong over them. And therefore, <HI>Wo unto the</HI> (blind) <HI>world becau&s;e of offences,</HI> Matth. xviii. 7.

men, touching the way to happine&s;s, there are almo&s;t as many opinions as there are men; they being <HI>turned every one to his own way,</HI> I&s;a. liii. 6. They are like the blind <HI>Sodomites</HI> about <HI>Lot</HI>'s hou&s;e, all were &s;eeking to find the door, &s;ome grope one part of the wall for it, &s;ome another; but none of them could certainly &s;ay, he had found it: and &s;o the natural man may &s;tumble on any good but the chief good.

<P><HI>Evid.</HI> 4. The natural man is void of the &s;aving knowledge of &s;piritual things. He knows not what a God he has to deal with; he is unacquainted with Chri&s;t; and knows not what &s;in is. The greate&s;t gracele&s;s wits are blind as moles in the&s;e things. Ay, but &s;ome &s;uch can &s;peak of them to good purpo&s;e: and &s;o might the&s;e <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> of the temptations, &s;igns and miracles, their eyes had &s;een, (Deut. xxix. 3.) to whom neverthele&s;s the Lord had not <HI>given an heart to perceive, and eyes to &s;ee, and ears to hear, unto that day,</HI> ver. 4. Many a man that bears the name of a Chri&s;tian, may make <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s confe&s;&s;ion of &s;aith, Exod. v. 2. <HI>I know not the Lord, neither will</HI> they <HI>let go</HI> when he commands them to part with. God is with them as a prince in di&s;gui&s;e among his &s;ubjects, who meets with no better treat|ment from them, than if they were his fellows, P&s;al. l. 21. Do they know Chri&s;t, or &s;ee his glory, and any beauty in him for which he is to be de&s;ired? if they did, they would not &s;light him as they do: a view of his glory would &s;o darken all created excellency, that they would take him for, and in&s;tead of all, and gladly clo&s;e with him, as he offereth him&s;elf in the go&s;pel, John iv. 10. P&s;al ix. 10. Matth. xiii. 44, 45, 59. Do they know what &s;in is, who hug the &s;erpent in their bo&s;om, hold fa&s;t deceit, and refu&s;e to let it go? I own indeed they may have a natural knowledge of tho&s;e things, as the unbelieving <HI>Jews</HI> had or Chri&s;t, whom they &s;aw and conver&s;ed with: but there was &s;piritual glory in him, perceived by believers only, Joh i. 14 and in re&s;pect of that glory, <HI>the</HI> (unbelieving) <HI>world knew him not,</HI> ver. 10. But the &s;piritual knowledge of them they cannot have; it is above the reach of the carnal mind, 1 Cor. ii. 14. <HI>The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are fooli&s;hne&s;s unto him: neither can he know them, for they are &s;pirit|ually di&s;cerned.</HI> He may indeed di&s;cour&s;e of them; but no other

way than one can talk of honey or vinegar, who never ta&s;ted the &s;weetne&s;s of the one, nor the &s;ourne&s;s of the other. He has &s;ome notions of &s;piritual truths, but &s;ees not the things them&s;elves, that are wrapt up in the words of truth, 1 Tim. i. 7. <HI>Under&s;tanding neither what they &s;ay, nor whereof they affirm.</HI> In a word natural men fear, &s;eek, confe&s;s, they know not what. Thus may you &s;ee man's under|&s;tanding naturally is overwhelmed with gro&s;s darkne&s;s in &s;piritual things.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> There is in the mind of man a natural bias to evil, where|by it comes to pa&s;s, that whatever difficulties it finds, while occupied about things truly good, it acts with a great deal of ea&s;e in evil; as being in that ca&s;e, in its own element, Jer. iv. 22. The carnal mind drives heavily in the thoughts of good; but furiou&s;ly in the thoughts of evil. While holine&s;s is before it, fetters are upon it: but when once it has got over the hedge, it is a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the bird got out of the cage, and becomes a free-thinker indeed. Let us reflect a little on the apprehen&s;ion and imagination of the carnal mind; and we &s;hall find unconte&s;tible evidence of this woful bias to evil.</P>
<P><HI>Evidence</HI> 1. As when a man, by a violent &s;troke on the head, lo&s;eth his &s;ight, there ari&s;eth to him a kind of fal&s;e light, whereby he per|ceiveth a thou&s;and airy nothings; &s;o man being &s;truck blind to all that is truly good, and for his eternal intere&s;t, has a light of another &s;ort brought into his mind; his eyes are opened, knowing evil, and &s;o are the words of the tempter verified, Gen. iii. 5. The words of the Prophet are plain, <HI>They are wi&s;e to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge,</HI> Jer. iv. 22. The mind of man has a natural dexterity to devi&s;e mi&s;chief: none are &s;o &s;imple, as to want &s;kill to contrive ways to gratify their lu&s;ts, and ruin their &s;ouls: tho' the power of every one's hand cannot reach to put their devi&s;es in execution. None needs to be taught this black art; but as weeds grow up, of their c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">cord in the neglected ground, &s;o doth this wi&s;dom (which is <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">thly, &s;en&s;ual, devili&s;h,</HI> James iii. 15) grow up in the minds of men, by virtue of the corruption of their nature. Why &s;hould we be &s;urpri&s;ed with the product of corrupt wits: their cunning devices to afront heaven, to oppo&s;e and run down truth and holine&s;s, and to gratify their own and other men's lu&s;t? They row with the &s;tream; no wonder they make great progre&s;s: their &s;tock is within them, and increa&s;eth by u&s;ing of it: and the works of darkne&s;s are contrived with the greater advantage, that the mind is wholly de&s;titute of &s;piritual light, which, if it were in them, in any mea&s;ure, would &s;o far mar the work, 1 John iii. 9. <HI>Who&s;oever is born of God, doth not commit &s;in;</HI> he does it not as by art, for <HI>his &s;eed remaineth in him.</HI> But on the other hand, <HI>It is a &s;port for a &s;oul to do mi&s;chief: but a man of under&s;tanding hath wi&s;dom,</HI> Prov. x. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. <HI>To do with wickedne&s;s nicely,</HI> as the word imports, is as a &s;port, or a play to a fool; it comes off with him ea&s;ily; and why, but becau&s;e he is a fool, and hath not wi&s;dom; which would mar the contrivances of darkne&s;s? The more natural a thing is, it is done the more ea&s;ily.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="045042_0049_101F7D10B76BCE20"><HI>Evid.</HI> 2. Let the corrupt mind have but the advantage of one's being employed in, or pre&s;ent at &s;ome piece of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">vice to God; that &s;o the device, if not in it&s;elf &s;inful, yet may become &s;inful, by its un&s;ea&s;onablene&s;s; it &s;hall quickly fall on &s;ome device or expedient, by its &s;tarting a&s;ide; which deliberation, in &s;ea&s;on, could not produce. Thus <HI>Saul,</HI> who wi&s;t not what to do, before the prie&s;t began to con|&s;ult God, is quickly determined when once the prie&s;t's hand was in: his own heart then gave him an an&s;wer, and would not allow him to wait an an&s;wer from the Lord, 1 Sam. xiv. 18, 19. Such a devili&s;h dexterity hath the carnal mind, in deviling what may mo&s;t effectually divert men from their duty to God.</P>
<P><HI>Evid.</HI> 3. Doth not the carnal mind naturally &s;trive to gra&s;p &s;piritual things in imagination; as if the &s;oul were quite immer&s;ed in fle&s;h and blood, and would turn every thing into its own &s;hape? Let men who are u&s;ed to the forming of the mo&s;t ab&s;tracted notion, look into their own &s;ouls, and they &s;hall find this bias in their minds: whereof the idolatry, which did of old, and &s;till doth, &s;o much prevail in the world, is an unconte&s;table evidence. For it plainly di&s;covers, that men na|turally would have a vi&s;ible deity, and &s;ee what they wor&s;hip: and therefore they <HI>changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image,</HI> Rom. i. 23. The reformation of the&s;e nations (ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord for it) hath bani&s;hed idolatry, and images too, out of our churches: but heart-reformation only can break down mental idolatry, and bani&s;h the more &s;ubtile and refined image-wor&s;hip, and repre&s;entation of the Deity, out of the minds of men. The world, in the time of its darkne&s;s, was never more prone to the former, than the un&s;anctified mind is to the latter. And hence are horrible, mon&s;trous, and mi|&s;hapen thoughts of God, Chri&s;t, the glory above, and all &s;piritual things.</P>
<P><HI>Evid.</HI> 4. What a difficult ta&s;k is it to detain the carnal mind before the Lord! how aver&s;e is it to the entertaining of good thoughts, and dwelling in the meditation of &s;piritual things! if one be driven, at any time, to think of the great concerns of his &s;oul, it is no harder work to hold in an unruly hungry bea&s;t, than to hedge in the carnal mind, that it get not away to the vanities of the world again. When God is &s;peaking to men by his word, or they are &s;peaking to him in prayer, doth not the mind often leave them before the Lord, like &s;o many <HI>idols that have eyes, but &s;ee not; and ears, but hear not?</HI> The carca&s;e is laid down before God, but the world gets away the heart: tho' the eyes be clo&s;ed, the man &s;ees a thou&s;and vanities: the mind, in the mean time, is like a bird got loo&s;e out of the cage, &s;kipping from bu&s;h to bu&s;h; &s;o that, in effect, the man never comes to him&s;elf, till he be <HI>gone from the pre&s;ence of the Lord.</HI> Say not, it is impo&s;&s;ible to get the mind fixed. It is hard indeed, but not impo&s;&s;ible. Grace from the Lord can do it, P&s;al. cviii. 1. Agreeable objections will do it. A plea&s;ant &s;peculation will arre&s;t the minds of the inqui&s;itive: the worldly man's mind is in little hazard of wandering, when he is contriving of bu&s;ine&s;s, ca&s;ting up his accounts, or telling his money:
<PB N="53" REF="045042_0050_101F7D1295E19000">
if he an&s;wer you not at fir&s;t, he tells you, he did not hear you, he was bu&s;y; his mind was fixed. Were we admitted into the pre&s;ence of a king to petition for our lives, we would be in no hazard of gazing through the chamber of pre&s;ence: But here lies the ca&s;e, the carnal mind, employed about any &s;piritual good, is out of its element, and therefore cannot fix.</P>
<P><HI>Evid.</HI> 5 But however hard it is to keep the mind on good thoughts, it &s;ticks as glue to what is evil and corrupt like it&s;elf! 2 Pet. ii. 14. <HI>Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cea&s;e from &s;in.</HI> Their eyes cannot cea&s;e from &s;in; (&s;o the words are con&s;tructed) that is, their hearts and minds venting by the eyes, what is within, are like a furious bea&s;t, which cannot be held in, when once it has got out its head. Let the corrupt imagination once be let loo&s;e on its proper object; it will be found hard work to call it back again, tho' both rea&s;on and <HI>will</HI> be for its retreat. For then it is in its own element; and to draw it off from its impurities, is as the drawing of a fi&s;h out of the water, or the renting of a limb from a man. It runs like fire &s;et to a train of powder, that re&s;teth not till it can get no further.</P>
<P><HI>Evid.</HI> 6. Con&s;ider how the carnal imagination &s;upplies the want of real objects to the corrupt heart; that it may make &s;inners happy, at lea&s;t, in the imaginary enjoyment of their lu&s;ts. Thus the corrupt heart feeds it&s;elf with imagination-&s;ins: the unclean per&s;on is filled with &s;peculative impurities, having eyes full of adultery; the covet|ous man fills his heart with the world, tho' he cannot get his hands full of it; the malicious per&s;on, with delight, acts his revenge within his own brea&s;t) the envious man, within his own narrow &s;oul, beholds, with &s;atisfaction, his neighbour laid low enough; and every lu&s;t finds the corrupt imagination a friend to it in time of need. And this it doth, not only when people are awake, but &s;ometimes even when they are a&s;leep; whereby it comes to pa&s;s, that the&s;e &s;ins are acted in dreams, which their hearts were carried out after, while they were awake. I know &s;ome do que&s;tion the &s;infulne&s;s of the&s;e things: But can it be thought they are con&s;i&s;tent with that holy nature and frame of &s;pirit, which was in innocent <HI>Adam,</HI> and in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and &s;hould be in every man? It is the corruption of nature then, that makes filthy dreamers condemned, Jude 8. <HI>Solomon</HI> had experience of the exerci&s;e of grace in &s;leep: in a dream he prayed, in a dream he made the be&s;t choice; both were accepted of God, 1 Kings iii. 5,&mdash; 15. And if a man may, in his &s;leep, do what is good and acceptable to God, why may he not al&s;o, when a&s;leep, do that which is evil and di&s;plea&s;ing to God? The &s;ame <HI>Solomon</HI> would have men aware of this; and pre&s;cribes the be&s;t remedy again&s;t it, namely, <HI>The law upon the heart,</HI> Prov. vi. 20, 21. <HI>When thou &s;leepe&s;t,</HI> (&s;ays he, ver. 22.) <HI>it &s;hall keep thee,</HI> to wit, from the &s;inning in thy &s;leep; that is, from &s;inful dreams: For one's being kept from &s;in, (not his being kept from affliction) is the immediate proper effect of the law of God im|pre&s;t upon the heart, P&s;al. cxix. 11. And thus the whole ver&s;e is
<PB N="54" REF="045042_0051_101F7D14A6027418">
to be under&s;tood, as appears from ver&s;e 23. <HI>For the commandment is a lamp, and the law is light, and reproofs of in&s;truction are the way of life.</HI> Now the law is a lamp of light, as it guides in the way of duty; and in&s;tructing reproofs from the law, are the way of life, as they keep from &s;in: neither do they guide into the way of peace, but as they lead into the way of duty; nor do they keep a man out of trouble, but as they keep him from &s;in. And remarkable is the particular in which <HI>Solomon</HI> in&s;tanceth, namely, the &s;in of uncleanne&s;s, <HI>to keep thee from the evil woman:</HI> and ver. 24. which is to be joined with ver&s;e 22. inclo&s;ing the 23d in a parenthe&s;is, as &s;ome ver&s;ions have it. The&s;e things may &s;uffice to convince us of the natural bias of the mind to evil.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> There is in the carnal mind, an oppo&s;ition to &s;piritual truths, and an aver&s;ion to the receiving of them. It is as little a friend to divine truths, as it is to holine&s;s. The truths of natural religion, which do, as it were, force their entry into the minds of natural men, they hold pri&s;oners in unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, Rom. i. 18. And as for the truths of revealed religion, there is <HI>an evil heart of unbelief</HI> in them, which oppo&s;eth their entry; and there is an armed force&mdash;nece&s;&s;ary to captivate the mind to the belief of them, 2 Cor. x 4, 5. God has made a revelation of his mind and will to &s;inners, touching the way of &s;alvation: he has given us the doctrine of his holy word: but do natural men believe it indeed? No, they do not; <HI>for he that believeth not on the Son of God, believeth not God,</HI> as is plain from 1 John v. 10. They believe not the promi&s;es of the word: they look on them, in effect, only as fair words; for the&s;e that receive them, are thereby made <HI>partakers of the divine nature,</HI> 2 Pet. i. 4. The promi&s;es are as &s;ilver cords let down from heaven to draw &s;inners unto God, and to waft them over into the promi&s;ed land; but they ca&s;t them from them. They believe not the threatnings of the word. As men travelling in defarts carry fire about with them, to fright away wild bea&s;ts: &s;o God has made his law a firey law, Deut. xxxiii. 2. hedging it about with threats of wrath: But men naturally are more bruti&s;h than bea&s;ts them&s;elves; and will needs touch the firey &s;moak|ing mountain, tho' they &s;hould <HI>be thru&s;t through with a dart.</HI> I doubt not, but mo&s;t, if not all of you, who are yet in the black &s;tate of nature will here plead, <HI>Not guilty&punc;</HI> But remember the carnal <HI>Jews</HI> in Chri&s;t's time, were as confident as you are, and they believed <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> John ix. 23, 29. But he confutes their confidence, roundly telling them, John v. 46. <HI>Had ye believed Mo&s;es, ye would have believed me.</HI> Did ye believe the truths of God, ye dur&s;t not reject, as ye do, Him who is truth it&s;elf. The very difficulty you find in a&s;&s;enting to this truth, bewrays that unbelief I am charging you with. Has it not proceeded &s;o far with &s;ome at this day, that it has &s;teeled their fore-heads with the impudence and impiety, openly to reject all revealed religion? Surely it is <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of the heart their mouth &s;peaketh.</HI> But tho' ye &s;et not your mouths again&s;t the heavens, as they do, the &s;ame
<PB N="55" REF="045042_0052_101F7D1C70A31490">
bitter root of unbelief is in all men by nature, and reigns in you, and will reign, till overcoming grace captivate your minds to the belief of the truth. To convince you in this point, con&s;ider the&s;e three things.</P>
<P><HI>Evidence</HI> 1. How few are there who have been ble&s;t with an in|ward illumination, by the &s;pecial operation of the Spirit of Chri&s;t, letting them into a view of divine truths in their &s;piritual and heavenly lu&s;tre! How have you learned the truths of religion, which ye pre|tended to believe! Ye have them merely by the benefit of external revelation, and of your education; &s;o that you are Chri&s;tians, ju&s;t becau&s;e you were not born and bred in a Pagan, but in a Chri&s;tian country. Ye are &s;trangers to the inward work of the holy Spirit, bearing witne&s;s by, and with the word in your hearts; and &s;o you cannot have the a&s;&s;urance of faith, with re&s;pect to that outward divine revelation made in the word, 1 Cor. ii. 10, 11, 12. And therefore ye are &s;till unbelievers. <HI>It is written in the prophets, And they &s;hall be all taught of God&mdash;Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me,</HI> &s;ays our Lord, John vi. 45. Now ye have not come to Chri&s;t, therefore ye have not been <HI>taught of God;</HI> ye have not been &s;o taught, and therefore ye have not come; ye believe not. Behold the revelation from which the faith even of the fundamental principles in religion doth &s;pring, Matth. xvi. 17, 18. <HI>Thou art Chri&s;t, the Son of the living God&mdash;Ble&s;&s;ed art thou Simon Barjona; for fle&s;h and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.</HI> If ever the Spirit of the LORD take a dealing with thee, to work in thee that faith, which is of the <HI>operation of God;</HI> it may be, as much time will be &s;pent in razing the old foundation, as will make thee find a nece&s;&s;ity of the <HI>working of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ghty power,</HI> and to enable thee to believe the very foundation principles, which now thou thinke&s;t thou make&s;t no doubt of, Eph. i. 19.</P>
<P><HI>Evid.</HI> 2. How many profe&s;&s;ors have made &s;hipwreck of their faith (&s;uch as it was) in time of temptation and trial! See how they fall, like &s;tars from heaven, when Antichri&s;t prevails, 2 The&s;&s;. ii 11, 12. <HI>God &s;hall &s;end them &s;trong delu&s;ions, that they &s;hould believe a lie, that they all might be damned, who believed not the truth.</HI> They fall into damning delu&s;ions: becau&s;e they never really believed the truth, tho' they them&s;elves and others too thought they did believe it. That hou&s;e is built upon the &s;and, and that faith is but ill-founded, that cannot bear out, but is quite overthrown, when the &s;torm <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">omes.</P>
<P><HI>Evid.</HI> 3. Con&s;ider the utter incon&s;i&s;tency of mo&s;t men's lives, with the principles of religion which they profe&s;s; ye may as &s;oon bring ea&s;t and we&s;t together, as their principles and practice. Men believe that fire will burn them, and therefore they will not throw them&s;elves into it: but the truth is, mo&s;t men live as if they thought the go&s;pel a mere fable, and the wrath of God revealed in his word again&s;t their unrighteou&s;ne&s;s and ungodline&s;s, a mere &s;care-crow. If ye believe the doctrines of the word, how is it that ye are &s;o unconcerned about the &s;tate of your &s;ouls before the LORD? How is it that you are &s;o
<PB N="56" REF="045042_0053_101F7D1E2EFE3E30">
little concerned with that weighty point, whether ye be born again or not? Many live as they were born, and are like to die as they live, and yet live in peace. Do &s;uch believe the &s;infulne&s;s and mi&s;ery of a natural &s;tate? Do they believe they are <HI>children of wrath?</HI> Do they believe there is no &s;alvation without regeneration? and no regenera|tion but what makes man a new creature? If you believe the promi&s;es of the word, why do you not embrace them, and labour to enter into the promi&s;ed re&s;t? What &s;luggard would not dig for a hid trea&s;ure, if he really believed he might &s;o obtain it? Men will work and &s;weat for a maintenance; becau&s;e they believe that by &s;o doing they will get it: yet they will be at no tolerable pains for <HI>the eternal weight of glory:</HI> why, but becau&s;e they do not believe the word of promi&s;e? Heb. iv. 1, 2. If ye believe the threatnings, how is it that you live in your &s;ins, live out of Chri&s;t, and yet hope for mercy? Do &s;uch believe God to be the holy and ju&s;t One, who <HI>will by no means clear the guilty?</HI> No, no, none believe, <HI>None</HI> (or next to none) <HI>believe what a ju&s;t GOD the LORD is, and how &s;everely he puni&s;heth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> There is in the mind of man a natural <HI>pronene&s;s to lies and fal&s;hood,</HI> which make for the &s;afety of lu&s;ts. <HI>They go a&s;tray as &s;oon as they be born, &s;peaking lies,</HI> P&s;al. lvii. 3. We have this with the re&s;t of the corruption of our nature, from our fir&s;t parents. God revealed the truth to them; but through the &s;olicitation of the temp|ter, they fir&s;t doubted of it; they di&s;believed it, and embraced a lie in&s;tead of it. And for an unconte&s;tible evidence hereof, we may &s;ee that fir&s;t article of the devil's creed, <HI>ye &s;hall not &s;urely die,</HI> Gen. iii. 4. which was obtruded by him on our fir&s;t parents, and by them re|ceived; naturally embraced by their po&s;terity, and held fa&s;t, till a light from heaven oblige them to quit it. It &s;preads it&s;elf through the lives of natural men; who, till their con&s;ciences be awakened, walk after their own lu&s;ts: &s;till retaining the principle, <HI>That they &s;hall not &s;urely die.</HI> And this is often improved to that perfection, that the man can &s;ay, over the belly of the denounced cur&s;e, <HI>I &s;hall have peace, tho' I walk in the imagination of mine heart, to add drunken|ne&s;s to thir&s;t,</HI> Deut. xxix. 19. Whatever advantage the truths of God have over error, by means of education, or otherwi&s;e; error has always, with the natural man, this advantge again&s;t truth, namely, That there is &s;omething within him, which &s;ays, <HI>O that it were true;</HI> &s;o that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> mind lies fair for a&s;&s;enting to it. And here is the rea&s;on of it. The true doctrine is, <HI>the doctrine that is according to godline&s;s,</HI> 1 Tim vi. 3. and <HI>the truth which is after godline&s;s,</HI> Tit. i, 1. Error, is the doctrine which is according to ungodline&s;s; for there is never an error in the mind, nor an untruth vented in the world, (in matters of religion) but what has an affinity with one corruption of the heart or other: according to that of the apo&s;tle, 2 The&s;&s; ii. 21 <HI>They believed not the truth, but had plea&s;ure in unrighteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> So that truth and error being otherwi&s;e attended with equal advantages for their reception, error, by this means, has mo&s;t ready acce&s;s into the minds
<PB N="57" REF="045042_0054_101F7D1FF84BFCC0">
of men in their natural &s;tate. Wherefore, it is nothing &s;trange that men reject the &s;implicity of go&s;pel truths and in&s;titutions, and greedily embrace error and external pomp in religion; &s;eeing they are &s;o agreeable to the lu&s;ts of the heart, and the vanity of the mind of the natural man. And from hence al&s;o it is, that &s;o many embrace athei&s;tical principles; for none do it but in compliance with their irregular pa&s;&s;ions: none but the&s;e, who&s;e advantage it would be that there was no God.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> Man is naturally high minded; for when the go&s;pel comes in power to him, it is employed in <HI>ca&s;ting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth it&s;elf again&s;t the knowledge of God,</HI> 2 Cor x. 5. Lowline&s;s of mind is not a flower that grows in the field of nature; but is planted by the finger of God in a renewed heart, and learned of the lowly Je&s;us. It is natural to man to think highly of him&s;elf, and what is his own; for the &s;troke he has got by his fall in <HI>Adam,</HI> has produced a fal&s;e light, whereby <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ole hills about him appear like mountains; and a thou&s;and airy beauties pre&s;ent them&s;elves to his deluded fancy. <HI>Vain man would be wi&s;e,</HI> (&s;o he accounts him&s;elf, and &s;o he would be accounted of by others) <HI>though man be born like a wild o&s;s's colt.</HI> Job xi. 12. His ways is right becau&s;e it is his own: for <HI>every way of a man is right in his own eyes,</HI> Prov. xxi. 2. His &s;tate is good, becau&s;e he knows no better: he is alive without the law, Rom. vii. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. and therefore his hope is &s;trong, and his confidence firm. It is another tower of <HI>Babel</HI> reared up again&s;t heaven; and &s;hall not fall while the power of darkne&s;s can hold it up. The word batters it, yet it &s;tands; one while breaches are made in it, but they are quickly repaired; at another time, it is all made to &s;hake; but &s;till it keeps up; till either God him&s;elf, by his Spirit, rai&s;e an heart-quake within the man, which tumbles it down; and leaves not one &s;tone upon another, (2 Cor. x. 41, 45.) or death batter it down and raze the foundations of it, Luke xvi. 23. And as the natural man thinks highly of him&s;elf, &s;o he thinks meanly of God, whatever he pretends, P&s;al. l. 21. <HI>Thou thoughte&s;t that I was altogether &s;uch an one as thy&s;elf.</HI> The doctrine of the go&s;pel, and the my&s;tery of Chri&s;t are fooli&s;hne&s;s to him; and in his practice he treats them as &s;uch, 1 Cor. i. 13. and ii. 14. He brings the word and the works of God in the government of the world, before the bar of his carnal rea&s;on; and there they are pre&s;umptuou&s;ly cen&s;ured and condemned, Ho&s;. xiv. 9. Sometimes the ordinary re&s;traint of providence is taken off, and <HI>Satan</HI> is permitted to &s;tir up the carnal mind; and in that ca&s;e it is like an ant's ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t, uncovered and di&s;turbed; doubts, denials, and helli&s;h rea&s;ons crowd in it, and cannot be laid by all the arguments brought again&s;t them, till a power from on high captivate the mind, and &s;till the mutiny of the corrupt principles.</P>
<P>Thus much of the <HI>corruption</HI> of the <HI>under&s;tanding:</HI> which, altho the half be not told, may di&s;cover to you the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of regenerating grace. Call the <HI>under&s;tanding</HI> now <HI>Ichabed;</HI> for the

glory is departed from it. Con&s;ider this, ye that are yet in the &s;tate of nature, and groan ye out your ca&s;e before the Lord, that the Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s may ari&s;e upon you, before you be &s;hut up in ever|la&s;ting darkne&s;s. What avails your worldly wi&s;dom?

<P N="2">II. The <HI>will,</HI> that commanding faculty, (which &s;ometimes was faithful, and ruled with God) is now turned traitor, and rules with, and for the devil. God plan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed it in man wholly a right &s;eed; but now it is <HI>turned into the degenerate plant of a &s;trange vine.</HI> It was originally placed in a due &s;ubordination to the <HI>will</HI> of God, as was &s;hewn before, but now it is gone wholly a&s;ide. However &s;ome do magnify the power of free-will, a view of the &s;pirituality of the law, to which acts of moral di&s;cipline do in no ways an&s;wer; and a deep in&s;ight into the corruption of nature, given by the inward operation of the Spirit, convincing of &s;in, righteou&s;ne&s;s and judgment, would make men find an ab&s;olute need of the power of free-grace, to remove the bands of wickedne&s;s from off the free-will. To open up this plague of the heart, I offer the&s;e following things to be con&s;idered.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> There is, in the unrenewed <HI>will,</HI> an utter inability for what is truly good and acceptable in the &s;ight of God: The natural man's <HI>will</HI> is in <HI>Satan</HI>'s fetters; hemmed in, within the circle of evil, and cannot move beyond it, more than a dead man can rai&s;e him&s;elf out of his grave, Eph. ii. 1. We deny him not a power to chu&s;e, pur&s;ue and act, what, on the matter, is good: but though he can <HI>will</HI> what is good and right, he can <HI>will</HI> nothing aright and well. John xv. 5. <HI>Without me,</HI> i. e &s;eparate from me, as a branch from the &s;tock, (as both the word and context do carry it) <HI>ye can do nothing;</HI> to wit, nothing truly and &s;piritually good His very choice and de&s;ire of &s;piritual things is carnal and &s;elfi&s;h, John vi. 26. <HI>Ye &s;eek me becau&s;e ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled.</HI> He not only comes to Chri&s;t, but he cannot come. John vi. 44. And what can one do acceptable to God, who believeth not on him whom the Father hath &s;ent? To evidence this inability for good in the unregenerate, con&s;ider the&s;e two things.</P>
<P><HI>Evidence</HI> 1. How often does the light &s;o &s;hine before men's eyes: that they cannot but &s;ee the good they &s;hould chu&s;e, and the evil they &s;hould refu&s;e; and yet their hearts have no more power to comply with that light than if they were arre&s;ted by &s;ome invi&s;ible hand? They &s;ee what is right; yet they follow, and cannot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="59" REF="045042_0056_101F7D23C9D3F208">
follow, what is wrong. Their con&s;ciences tells them the right way, and approves of it too; yet cannot their <HI>will</HI> be brought up to it: their corruption &s;o chains them, that they cannot embrace it; &s;o they &s;igh, and go backward, over the belly of their light. And if it be not thus, how is it that the word, and way of holine&s;s meets with &s;uch entertainment in the world? How is it that clear arguments and rea&s;on on the &s;ide of piety and a holy life, which bear in them&s;elves even on the carnal mind, do not bring men over to that &s;ide? Altho' the being of a heaven and a hell, were but a <HI>may be,</HI> it were &s;ufficient to determine the will to the choice of holine&s;s, were it capable to be determined thereto by mere rea&s;on: but men, knowing the judgment of God, (that they which commit &s;uch things are worthy of death) not only do the &s;ame, but have plea&s;ure in them that do them, Rom. i 32. And how is it that the&s;e who magnify the power of free-will do not confirm their opinion before the world, by an ocular demon|&s;tration, in a practice as far above others in holine&s;s, as the opinion of their natural ability is above others? Or is it maintained only for the protection of lu&s;ts, which men may hold fa&s;t as long as they plea&s;e; and when they have no more u&s;e for them, can throw them off in a moment, and leap out of <HI>Delilah</HI>'s lap into <HI>Abraham</HI>'s bo&s;om? What|ever u&s;e &s;ome make of that principle: it does of it&s;elf, and in its own nature, ca&s;t a broad &s;hadow for a &s;helter to wickedne&s;s of heart and life. And it may be ob&s;erved, that the generality of the hearers of the go&s;pel, of all denominations are plagued with it: for it is a root of bitterne&s;s, natural to all men; from whence do &s;pring &s;o much fearle&s;&s;ne&s;s about the &s;oul's eternal &s;tate; &s;o many delays and off-puts in that weighty matter, whereby much work is laid up for a death-bed by &s;ome; while others are ruined by a legal walk, and unacquainted with the life of faith, and the making u&s;e of Chri&s;t for &s;anctification; all flowing from the per&s;ua&s;ion of &s;ufficient natural abilities. So agreeable is it to corrupt nature.</P>
<P><HI>Evid.</HI> 2. Let tho&s;e, who, by the power of the &s;pirit of bondage, having had the law laid out before them, in its &s;pirituality, for their conviction &s;peak and tell, if they found them&s;elves able to incline their hearts towards it, in that ca&s;e; nay, if the more that light &s;hone into their &s;ouls, they did not find their hearts more and more unable to comply with it. There are &s;ome, who have been brought unto the place of the breaking forth, who are yet in the devil's camp, that from their experience can tell, light let into the mind, cannot give life to the will, to enable it to comply therewith: and could give their te&s;timony here, if they would. But take <HI>Paul</HI>'s te&s;timony concerning it, who, in his unconverted &s;tate, was far from believing his utter inability for good; but learned it by experience, Rom. vi.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> 9.10, 11, 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. I own, the natural man may have a kind of love to the law: but here lies the &s;tre&s;s of the matter, he looks on the holy law in a carnal dre&s;s: and &s;o, while he hugs a creature of his own fancy, he thinks he has the law, but in very deed he is without the
<PB N="60" REF="045042_0057_101F7D2BAF9F0270">
law: for as yet he &s;ees it not in its &s;pirituality: if he did, he would find it the very rever&s;e of his own nature, and what his will could not fall in with, till changed by the power of grace.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> There is in the unrenewed <HI>will</HI> an aver&s;ene&s;s to good. Sin is the natural man's element; he is loath to part with it, as the fi&s;hes are to come out of the water into dry land. He not only cannot come to Chri&s;t, but he will not come, John v. 40. He is polluted, and hates to be wa&s;hen, Jer. xiii. 27 <HI>Wilt thou not be made clean? When &s;hall it once be?</HI> He is &s;ick, but utterly aver&s;e to the remedy: he loves his di&s;ea&s;e &s;o, that he loaths the Phy&s;ician. He is a captive, a pri&s;oner, and a &s;lave; but he loves his conqueror, his jailor and ma&s;ter: he is fond of his fetters, pri&s;on and drudgery; and has no liking to his liberty. For evidence of this aver&s;ene&s;s to good, in the will of man, I &s;hall in&s;tance in &s;ome particulars.</P>
<P><HI>Evidence</HI> 1. The untowardne&s;s of children. Do we not &s;ee them naturally, lovers of &s;inful liberty! How unwilling are they to be hedged in? How aver&s;e to re&s;traint? The world can bear witne&s;s, that they are, <HI>as bullocks unaccu&s;tomed to the yoke;</HI> and more, that it is far ea&s;ier to bring young bullocks tamely to bear the yoke; than to bring young children under di&s;cipline, and make them tamely &s;ub|mit to the re&s;traint of &s;inful liberty. Every body may &s;ee in this, as in a gla&s;s, that man is naturally wild and wilful, according to <HI>Zophar</HI>'s ob&s;erve, Job xi. 12. that <HI>man is born like a wild a&s;s</HI>'s <HI>colt.</HI> What can be &s;aid more? He is like a colt, the colt of an a&s;s, the colt of a wild a&s;s Compare Jer. ii. 24. <HI>A wild a&s;s u&s;ed to the wilderne&s;s, that &s;nuffeth up the wind at her plea&s;ure, in her occa&s;ion who can turn her away?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Evid.</HI> 2. What pain and difficulty do men often find in bringing their hearts to religious duties? And what a ta&s;k is it to the carnal heart to abide at them? It is a pain to it, to leave the world but a little, to conver&s;e with God. It is not ea&s;y to borrow time from the many things, to be&s;tow it upon the <HI>one thing needful.</HI> Men often go to God in duties, with their faces towards the world; and when their bodies are on the mount of ordinances, their hearts will be found at the foot of the hill, <HI>going after their covetou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> Ezek. xxxiii. 31. They are &s;oon wearied of well-doing; for holy duties are not agreeable to their corrupt nature. Take notice of them at their worldly bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;et them down with their carnal company, or let them be &s;ucking the brea&s;ts of a lu&s;t; time &s;eems to them to fly, and drive furiou&s;ly, &s;o that it is gone ere they are aware. But how heavily does it drive, while a prayer, a &s;ermon, or a &s;abbath la&s;ts? The Lord's day is the longe&s;t day of all the week with many; and therefore they mu&s;t &s;leep longer that morning, and go &s;ooner to bed that night, than ordinarily they do; that the day may be made of a tolerable length: for their hearts &s;ay within them, <HI>when will the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bbath be gone?</HI> Amos viii. 5. The hours of wor&s;hip are the longe&s;t hours of that day: hence when duty is over, they are like men ea&s;ed of a burden; and when &s;ermon is ended, many have neither t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="61" REF="045042_0058_101F7D2D659E4790">
grace nor the good manners to &s;tay till the ble&s;&s;ing be pronounced, but like the bea&s;ts, their head is away as &s;oon as one puts his hand to loo&s;e them; why, but becau&s;e while they are at ordinances, they are, as Doeg, <HI>detained before the Lord,</HI> 1 Sam. xxii. 7.</P>
<P><HI>Evid.</HI> 3. Con&s;ider how the <HI>will</HI> of the natural man doth <HI>rebel again&s;t the light,</HI> Job xxiv. 13. Light &s;ometimes entreth in, becau&s;e he is not able to hold it out: but he loveth darkne&s;s rather than light. Sometimes by the force of truth, the outer door of under&s;tanding is broken up; but the inner door of the <HI>will</HI> remains fa&s;t bolted. Then lu&s;ts ri&s;e again&s;t light; corruption and con&s;cience encounter, and fight as in the field of battle; till corruption getting the upper hand, con|&s;cience is forced to give back: convictions are murdered: and truth is made and held pri&s;oner, &s;o that it can create no more di&s;turbance. While the word is preached or read, or the rod of God is upon the natural man, &s;ometimes convictions are darted in on him, and his &s;pirit is wounded, in greater or le&s;&s;er mea&s;ure: but the&s;e convictions not being able to make him fall, he runs away with the arrows &s;ticking in his con&s;cience; and at length, one way or other, gets them out, and licks him&s;elf whole again. Thus, while the light &s;hines, men, naturally aver&s;e to it, wilfully &s;hut their eyes; till God is provoked to blind them judicially, and they become proof again&s;t the, word and providences too: &s;o they may go where they will, they can &s;it at ea&s;e; there is never a word from heaven to them, that goeth deeper than into their ears, Ho&s; iv. 17. <HI>Ephraim is joined to idols, let him alone.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Evid.</HI> 4. Let us ob&s;erve the re&s;i&s;tance made by elect &s;ouls, when the Spirit of the Lord is at work, to bring them from <HI>the power of Satan unto God. Zion</HI>'s King gets no &s;ubjects but by &s;troke of &s;word, <HI>in the day of his power,</HI> P&s;al. cx. 2, 3. None come to him, but &s;uch as are drawn by a divine hand, John vi. 44. When the Lord comes to the &s;oul, he finds the &s;trong man keeping the hou&s;e, and a deep peace and &s;ecurity there, while the &s;oul is fa&s;t a&s;leep in the devil's arms. But <HI>the prey mu&s;t be taken from the mighty, and the captive delivered.</HI> Therefore the Lord awakens the &s;inner, opens his eyes, and &s;trikes him with terror, while the clouds are black above his head, and the &s;word of vengeance is held to his brea&s;t. Now he is at no &s;mall pains to put a fair face on a black heart; to &s;hake off his fears, to make head again&s;t them, and to divert him&s;elf from thinking on the unplea&s;ant and ungrateful &s;ubject of his &s;oul's ca&s;e. If he cannot &s;o rid him&s;elf from them, carnal rea&s;on is called in to help, and urgeth that there is no ground for &s;o great fear; all may be well enough yet: and if it be ill with him, it will be ill with many. When the &s;inner is beat from this, and &s;ees no advantage of going to hell with com|pany, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e re&s;olves to leave his &s;ins, but cannot think of breaking off &s;o &s;oon; there is time enough, and he will do it afterwards. Con&s;cience &s;ays, <HI>To-day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts:</HI> but he cries, <HI>To-morrow, Lord, to-morrow, Lord;</HI> and <HI>ju&s;t now Lord,</HI> till that now is never like to come. And thus, many times, he comes from
<PB N="62" REF="045042_0059_101F7D2F49A9C528">
his prayers and confe&s;&s;ions, with nothing, but a brea&s;t full of &s;harper convictions; for the heart doth not always ca&s;t up the &s;weet mor&s;el, as &s;oon as confe&s;&s;ion is made with the mouth, Judges x. 10.&mdash;16. And when con&s;cience obligeth them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o part with &s;ome lu&s;ts, others are kept as right eyes and right hands; and there are rueful looks after tho&s;e that are put away, as it was with the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> who, with bitter hearts, did remember <HI>the fifth they did eat in Egypt freely,</HI> Num. xi. 5. Nay, when he is &s;o pre&s;&s;ed, that he mu&s;t needs &s;ay before the Lord, that he is content to part with all his idols; the heart will be giving the tongue the lie. In a word, the &s;oul, in this ca&s;e, will &s;hift from one thing to another; like a fish with the hook in his jaws, till it can do no more, and power come to make it &s;uccumb, as <HI>the wild a&s;s in her month,</HI> Jer. ii. 24.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> There is in the will of man a natural pronene&s;s to evil, a woful bent towards &s;in. Men naturally are <HI>bent to back&s;liding from God,</HI> Ho&s;. ii 7. They hang (as the word is) towards back&s;liding; even as a hanging wall, who&s;e <HI>breaking cometh &s;uddenly at an in&s;tant.</HI> Set holine&s;s and life upon the one &s;ide, &s;in and death upon the other; leave the unrenewed will to it&s;elf, it will chu&s;e &s;in, and reject holine&s;s. This is no more to be doubted, than that water, poured on the &s;ide of a hill, will run downward but not upward, or that a flame will a&s;cend and not de&s;cend.</P>
<P><HI>Evidence</HI> 1. Is not the way of evil the fir&s;t way the children of men do go! Do not their inclinations plainly appear on the wrong &s;ide, while yet they have no cunning to hide them? In the fir&s;t opening of our eyes in the world, we look a-&s;quint, hell-ward, not heaven-ward. As &s;oon as it appears we are rea&s;onable creatures, it appears we are &s;inful creatures, P&s;al. lviii. 3. <HI>The wicked are e&s;tranged from the womb: they go a&s;tray as &s;oon as they be born.</HI> Prov. xxii. 15. <HI>Fooli&s;hne&s;s is b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d in the heart of a child: but the rod of correction &s;hall drive it far from him.</HI> Folly is bound in the heart, it is woven into our very nature. The knot will not loo&s;e, they mu&s;t be broken a&s;under by &s;trokes. Words will not do it, the rod mu&s;t be taken to drive it away: and if it be not driven far away, the heart and it will meet and knit again. Not that the rod of it&s;elf will do this: the &s;ad experience of many parents te&s;tifies the contrary: and <HI>Solomon</HI> him&s;elf tells you, Prov. xxvii. 22. <HI>Though thou &s;hould&s;t bray a fool in a mortar, among wheat, with a pe&s;tle, yet will not his fooli&s;hne&s;s depart from him.</HI> It is &s;o bound in his heart. But the rod is an ordinance of God, appointed for that end; which, like the word, is made effectual, by the Spirit's accompanying his own ordinance. And this, by the way, &s;hews that parents, in admini&s;tring correction to their children, have need, fir&s;t of all to correct their own irregular pa&s;&s;ions and look upon it as a matter of awful &s;olemnity, &s;etting about it with much depend|ence on the Lord, and following it with prayer for the ble&s;&s;ing, they would have it effectual.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="045042_0060_101F7D3174809128"><HI>Evid.</HI> 2. How ea&s;ily are men led a&s;ide to &s;in! The children, who are not per&s;uaded to good; are otherways &s;imple ones; ea&s;ily wrought upon; tho&s;e whom the word cannot draw to holine&s;s, are <HI>led by Satan at his plea&s;ure.</HI> Profane <HI>E&s;au,</HI> that cunning man, Gen. xxv. 27. was as ea&s;ily cheated of the ble&s;&s;ing, as if he had been a fool or an ideot. The more natural a thing is, it is the more ea&s;y: &s;o Chri&s;t's yoke is ea&s;y to the &s;aints, in &s;o far as they are <HI>partakers of the divine nature:</HI> and &s;in is ea&s;y to the unrenewed man; but to learn to do good, as difficult as for the <HI>Ethi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pian to change his &s;kin;</HI> becau&s;e the <HI>will</HI> natu|rally hangs towards evil; but is aver&s;e to good. A child can cau&s;e a round thing to run, while he cannot move a &s;quare thing of the &s;ame weight; for the roundne&s;s makes it fit for motion, &s;o that it goes with a touch. Even &s;o, when men find the heare ea&s;ily carried towards &s;in, while it is as a dead weight in the way of holine&s;s; we mu&s;t bring the rea&s;on of this from the natural &s;et and di&s;po&s;ition of the heart, whereby it is prone and bent to evil. Were man's <HI>will</HI> naturally, but in an equal balance to good and evil, the one might be embraced with as little difficulty as the other; but experience te&s;tifies, it is not &s;o. In the &s;acred hi&s;tory of the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> e&s;pecially in the book of <HI>Judges,</HI> how often do we find them for&s;aking JEHOVAH, the mighty GOD, and doting upon the idols of the nations about them? But did ever one of the&s;e nations grow &s;ond of <HI>I&s;rael</HI>'s GOD, and for&s;ake their own idols? No, no; tho' man is naturally given to changes, it is but from evil to evil, not from evil to good, Jer. ii 10, 11. <HI>Hath a nation changed their gods, which yet are no gods? But my p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ople have changed their glory, for that which doth not profit.</HI> Surely the <HI>will</HI> of man &s;tands not in equal balance, but has a ca&s;t to the wrong &s;ide.</P>
<P><HI>Evid.</HI> 3. Con&s;ider how men go on &s;till in the way of &s;in, till they meet with a &s;top, and that from another hand than their own; I&s;a. lvii. 17. <HI>I hid me, and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart.</HI> If God withdraw his re&s;training hand, and lay the reins on the &s;inner's neck, he is in no doubt what way to choo&s;e; for (ob&s;erve it) the way of &s;in is the way of his heart; his heart naturally lies that way; it hath a natural propen&s;ity to &s;in. As long as God &s;uffereth them, they walk in their own way, Acts xiv. 16 The natural man is &s;o fixed in his woful choice, that there needs no more to &s;hew he is oft from God's way, but to tell he is upon his own.</P>
<P><HI>Evid.</HI> 4. Whatever good impre&s;&s;ions are made upon him they do not la&s;t. Tho' his heart be firm as a &s;tone, yea, harder than the nether mill-&s;tone, in point of receiving of them; it is otherwi&s;e un&s;table as water, and cannot keep them. It works again&s;t the receiving of them; and, when they are made, it works them off, and returns to its natural bias; Ho&s;. vi. 4. <HI>Your goodne&s;s is as the morn|ing cloud, and as the early dew, it goeth away.</HI> The morning cloud promi&s;eth a hearty &s;hower; but, when the &s;un ari&s;eth, it evani&s;heth: the &s;un beats upon the early dew, and it evaporates; &s;o the hu&s;band|man's expectation is di&s;appointed.

They need to watch, and keep their hearts with all diligence: and their &s;ad experience toucheth them, that, <HI>He that tru&s;teth in his own heart is a fool,</HI> Prov. xxviii. 26.

<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> There is a natural contrariety, direct oppo&s;ition and enmity, in the <HI>will</HI> of man, to God him&s;elf, and his holy <HI>will,</HI> Rom. viii. 7. <HI>The carnal mind is enmity again&s;t God, for it is not &s;ubject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.</HI> The will was once God's dep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t&punc; in the &s;oul, &s;et to command there for him; but now it is &s;et up again&s;t him.

<P>I have a charge again&s;t every unregenerate man and woman, young or old, to be verified by the te&s;timonies of the &s;criptures of truth, and the te&s;timony of their own con&s;ciences; namely, that whether they be profe&s;&s;ors or prophane, whether they be, &s;eeing they are not born again, they are heart-enemies to God: to the <HI>Son of God;</HI> to the <HI>Spirit of God:</HI> and to the law of God.

<P N="1">1<HI>&s;t,</HI> Ye are <HI>enemies to God in your minds,</HI> Col. i. 21. Ye are not as yet reconciled to him, the natural enmity is not as yet &s;lain, tho' perhaps it lies hid, and ye do not perceive it. (1.) Ye are enemies to the very being of God, P&s;al. xv. 1. <HI>The fool hath &s;aid in his heart, there is no God.</HI> The proud man would that none were above him&s;elf: the rebel, that there were no king; and the unrenewed man, who is a ma&s;s of pride and rebellion, that there were no God. He &s;aith it in his heart, he wi&s;heth it were &s;o, tho' he be a&s;hamed and afraid to &s;peak it out. And that all natural men are &s;uch fools, appears from the Apo&s;tle's quoting a part of this p&s;alm, <HI>That every mouth may be &s;topped,</HI> Rom. iii. 10, 11, 12, 19. I own indeed, that while the natural man looks on God as the Creator and Pre&s;erver of the world; becau&s;e he loves his own &s;elf, therefore his heart ri&s;eth not again&s;t the being of his Benefactor: but this enmity will quickly appear, when he looks on God, as the Rector and Judge of the world, bind|ing him, under the pain of the cur&s;e, to exact holine&s;s, and girding him with the cords of death, becau&s;e of his &s;in. Li&s;ten, in this ca&s;e, to the voice of the heart, and then will find it to be <HI>no God.</HI> (2.)

<P>Now upon this, I would, for your conviction, propo&s;e to your con&s;ciences a few queries, (1.) <HI>How &s;tand your hearts affected to the infinite purity and holine&s;s of God?</HI> Con&s;cience will give an an&s;wer to this, which the tongue will not &s;peak out, If ye be not partakers of his holine&s;s, ye cannot be reconciled to it. The <HI>Pagans</HI> finding they could not be like God in holine&s;s, made their gods like them&s;elves in filthine&s;s: and thereby di&s;covered what &s;ort of a god the natural man would have. God is holy; can an unholy creature love his un&s;potted holine&s;s? Nay, it is the righteous only that can <HI>give thanks at the remembrance of his holine&s;s,</HI> P&s;al. lxxxvii. 12. God is light; can creatures of darkne&s;s rejoice therein? Nay, <HI>every one that doth evil hateth the light,</HI> John iii. 29. For, <HI>what communion hath light with darkne&s;s?</HI> 2 Cor. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i. 14. (2.) <HI>How &s;tand your hearts affected to the ju&s;tice of God?</HI> There is not a man, who is wedded to his lu&s;ts, as all the unregenerate are, but would be-content, with the blood of his body, to blot that letter out of the name of God, Can the male factor love his condemning judge? Or an unju&s;tified &s;inner, a ju&s;t God? No, he cannot, Luke vii. 47. <HI>To whom little is forgiven, the &s;ame loveth little.</HI> Hence &s;eeing men cannot get the doctrine of his Ju&s;tice blotted out of the Bible; yet it is &s;uch an eye-&s;ore to them, that they &s;trive to blot it out of their minds. And they ruin them&s;elves by pre&s;uming on his mercy; while they are not careful to get a righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, wherein they may &s;tand before his Ju&s;tice; but <HI>&s;ay in their heart, The Lord will not do good; neither will he do evil,</HI> Zeph. i. 12. (3.) <HI>How &s;tand ye affected to the Omni&s;cience and Omnipre&s;ence of God?</HI> Men naturally would rather have a blind idol, than an all-&s;eeing God; and therefore do what they can, as Adam did, to hide them&s;elves from the pre&s;ence of the Lord. They no more love an all-&s;eeing, every-where-pre&s;ent God, than the thief loves to have the judge witne&s;s to his evil deeds.

There are thou&s;ands who hear the go&s;pel, that hope to be &s;aved, and think all &s;afe with them for eternity, who never had any experience of the new birth, nor do at all concern them&s;elves in that que&s;tion, <HI>Whether they are burn

<P N="2">2<HI>dly,</HI> Ye are enemies to the <HI>Son of God</HI> That enmity to Chri&s;t is in your hearts, which would have made you join the hu&s;bandmen, who <HI>killed the heir, and ca&s;t him out of the vineyard:</HI> If ye had been be&s;et with their temptations, and no more re&s;trained than they were <HI>Am I a d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g,</HI> you will &s;ay, to have &s;o treated my &s;weet Saviour? &s;o &s;aid <HI>Hazael</HI> in another ca&s;e; but when he had the temptation, he was a dog to do it.

Alas! it is but a mi&s;taken Chri&s;t that is &s;weet to you, who&s;e &s;ouls lothe that Chri&s;t, who <HI>is the brightne&s;s of the Father's glory, and the expre&s;s image of his per&s;on.</HI> It is with you as it was in the carnal <HI>Jews,</HI> who delighted in him while they mi&s;took his errand into the world, fancying that he would be a temporal deliverer to them, Mal. iii. 1 But when he was come, and <HI>&s;at as a refiner and purifier of &s;ilver,</HI> ver&s;e 2, 3. and ca&s;t them as reprobate &s;ilver, who thought to have had no &s;mall honour in the kingdom of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI>; his doctrine galled their con&s;ciences, and they re&s;ted not till they imbrued their hands in his blood. To open your eyes in this point, which ye are &s;o loth to believe, I will lay before you, <HI>the enmity of your hearts</HI> again&s;t Chri&s;t and all his offices.</P>
<P N="1">1. Every unregenerate man is an enemy to Chri&s;t in his Prophetical Office. He is appointed of the Father, the great Prophet and Teacher; but not upon the world's call, who, in their natural &s;tate, would have unanimou&s;ly voted again&s;t him: And therefore, when he came, he was condemned as a &s;educer and bla&s;phemer.

<P><HI>Evidence</HI> 1. Con&s;ider the entertainment he meets with, when he comes to teach &s;ouls inwardly by his Spirit. Men do what they can to &s;top their ears, like the deaf adder that they may not hear his voice.

<P><HI>Evid.</HI> 2. Con&s;ider the entertainment he meets with, when he comes to teach men outwardly by his word.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) His written word, the Bible, is &s;lighted; Chri&s;t hath left it to us, as the book of our in&s;tructions, to &s;how us what way we mu&s;t &s;teer our cour&s;e, if we would come to <HI>Emmanuel</HI>'s land. It is a lamp to light us through a dark world to eternal light. And he hath left it upon us, to &s;earch it with that diligence, wherewith men dig into mines for &s;ilver and gold. John v. 39 But ah! how is this &s;acred trea&s;ure profaned by many! They ridicule the holy word, by which they mu&s;t be judged at the la&s;t day; and will rather lo&s;e their &s;ouls than their je&s;t, dre&s;&s;ing up the conceit of their wanton wits in &s;cripture phra&s;es; in which they act as mad a part, as one who would dig into a mine to procure metal to melt and pour down his own and his neighbour's throat. Many exhau&s;t their &s;pirits in reading romances, and their minds pur&s;ue them, as the &s;ame doth the dry &s;tubble; while they have no heart for, nor reli&s;h of the holy word, and therefore &s;eldom take a Bible in their hands. What is agreeable to the vanity of their minds, is plea&s;ant and taking; but what recommends holine&s;s to their unholy hearts, makes their &s;pirits dull and flat. What plea&s;ure will they find in reading of a profane ballad, or &s;tory book, to whom the <HI>Bible</HI> is ta&s;tele&s;s, as the white of an egg! Many lay by their Bibles with their Sabbath day's clothes; and whatever u&s;e they have for their clothes, they have none for their Bibles, till the return of the Sabbath. Alas! the du&s;t or finery about your Bibles is a witne&s;s now, and will, at the la&s;t day, be a witne&s;s of the enmity of your hearts again&s;t Chri&s;t, as a <HI>Prophet.</HI> Be&s;ides all this, among the&s;e who ordi|narily read the &s;criptures, how few are there that read it as the word of the Lord to their &s;ouls, and keep communion with him in it. They do not make his &s;tatutes their coun&s;ellors, nor doth their particular ca&s;e &s;end them to their Bibles. They are &s;trangers to the &s;olid <HI>comfort of the &s;criptures.</HI> And if at any time they be dejected, it is &s;omething el&s;e than the word that revives them: as <HI>Ahab</HI> was cured of his &s;ullen &s;it, by the &s;ecuring of <HI>Naboth</HI>'s vineyard for him.</P>

Such is the enmity of the hearts of men again&s;t Chri&s;t, in his prophetical office.</P>
<P N="2">2. The natural man is an enemy to Chri&s;t in his prie&s;tly office. He is appointed of the Father <HI>a Prie&s;t for ever:</HI> that, by his alone &s;acrifice and interce&s;&s;ion, &s;inners may have peace with, and acce&s;s to God; but Chri&s;t crucified is a &s;tumbling block, and fooli&s;hne&s;s to the unrenewed part of mankind, to whom he is preached, 1 Cor. i 23. They are not for him, as the <HI>new and living way.</HI> Nor is he by the voice of the world, <HI>an High Prie&s;t over the hou&s;e of God.</HI> Corrupt nature goes quite another way to work.</P>
<P><HI>Evidence</HI> 1. None of <HI>Adam</HI>'s children naturally incline to receive the ble&s;&s;ing in borrowed robes; but would always, according to the &s;pider's motto, <HI>owe all to them&s;elves;</HI> and &s;o climb up to heaven on a thread &s;pun out of their own bowels. For they <HI>de&s;ire to be under the law,</HI> Gal. iv. 24. And <HI>go about to e&s;tabli&s;h their own righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> Rom. x. 3. Man, naturally, looks on GOD as a great Ma&s;ter; and
<PB N="70" REF="045042_0067_101F7D4AACC94178">
him&s;elf as his &s;ervant, that mu&s;t work and win heaven as his wages. Hence, when con&s;cience is awakened, he thinks that, to the end he may be &s;aved, he mu&s;t an&s;wer the demands of the law; &s;erve God <HI>as well as he can,</HI> and pray for mercy wherein he comes &s;hort. And thus many come to duties, that never come out of them to Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Evid.</HI> 2. As men, naturally, think highly of their duties, that &s;eem to them, to be well done; &s;o they look for acceptance with God ac|cording <HI>as their work is done,</HI> not <HI>according to the &s;hare they have in the blood of Chri&s;t. Wherefore have we fa&s;ted, &s;ay they, and thou &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t not?</HI> They'll value them&s;elves on their performances and attainments: yea, their very opinions in religion, (Philip. iii 4, 5, 6, 7.) taking to them&s;elves, what they rob from Chri&s;t the great High-prie&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Evid.</HI> 3. The natural man going to God, in duties, will always be found, either to go without a mediator, or with more than the only Mediator JESUS CHRIST. Nature is blind, and therefore venturous: it &s;ets a man a going immediately to God without Chri&s;t; to ru&s;h into his pre&s;ence, and put their petitions in his hand, without being introduced by the Secretary of heaven, or putting their reque&s;ts into his hand. So fixed is this di&s;po&s;ition in the unrenewed heart, that when many hearers of the go&s;pel are conver&s;ed with upon the point of their hopes of &s;alvation, the name of Chri&s;t will &s;carcely be heard from their mouths. A&s;k them how they think to obtain the pardon of &s;in? they will tell you, they beg and look for mercy, becau&s;e God is a merciful God; and that is all they have to confide in. Others look for mercy for Chri&s;t's &s;ake; but how do they know that Chri&s;t will take their plea in hand. Why, as the Papi&s;ts have their mediators with the Mediator, &s;o have they. They know he cannot but do it; for they pray, confe&s;s, mourn, and have great de&s;ires, and the like; and &s;o have &s;omething of their own to commend them unto him: they were never made poor in &s;pirit, and brought empty-handed to Chri&s;t, to lay the &s;tre&s;s of all on his atoning blood.</P>
<P N="3">3. The natural man is an enemy to Chri&s;t in his kingly office. The Father has appointed the Mediator King in Zion, P&s;al. ii. 6. And all to whom the go&s;pel comes, are commanded, on their highe&s;t peril, to <HI>ki&s;s the Son,</HI> and &s;ubmit them&s;elves unto him, ver. 12. But the natural voice of mankind is, <HI>Away with him;</HI> as you may &s;ee, ver. 2, 3. They will not have him to reign over them, Luke xix. 14.</P>
<P><HI>Evidence</HI> 1. The workings of corrupt nature to wre&s;t the govern|ment out of his hands. No &s;ooner was he born, but being <HI>born a King,</HI> Herod per&s;ecuted him, Matth. ii. And when he was crucified, they &s;et up over his head his accu&s;ation written, <HI>This is Je&s;us, the King of the Jews,</HI> Matth. xxvii. 37. Though his kingdom be a &s;piritual kingdom, and not of this world; yet they cannot allow him a kingdom within a kingdom, which acknowledgeth no other head or &s;upreme, but the royal Mediator. They make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> with his royal prerogatives, changing his laws, in&s;titutions and ordinances, modelling his wor&s;hip according to the devices of their own hearts; introducing new offices

and officers into his kingdom, not to be found in <HI>the book of the manner</HI> of his kingdom, di&s;po&s;ing of the external government thereof, as may be&s;t &s;uit their carnal de&s;igns. Such is the enmity of the hearts of men again&s;t Zion's KING.</P>
<P><HI>Evid</HI> 2 How unwilling are men, naturally to &s;ubmit unto, and be hedged in by the laws and di&s;cipline of his Kingdom! As a King, he is a Law-giver, (I&s;a. xxxiii 22.) and has appointed an external government, di&s;cipline and cen&s;ors, to controul the unruly, and to keep his profe&s;&s;ed &s;ubjects in order, to be exerci&s;ed by officers of his own appointment, Matth. xviii. 17, 18 1 Cor. xii. 28. 1 Tim. v. 17. Heb. xiii 17. But the&s;e are the great eye-&s;ores of the carnal world, who love &s;inful liberty, and therefore cry out, <HI>Let us break their bands a&s;under, and ca&s;t away their cords from us,</HI> P&s;al. ii. 3. Hence this work is found to be, in a &s;pecial manner, a &s;triving again&s;t the &s;tream of corrupt nature, which, for the mo&s;t part, puts &s;uch a face on the church, as if there were <HI>no King in I&s;rael,</HI> every one doing that which is <HI>right in his own eyes.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Evid.</HI> 3. However natural men may be brought to feign &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the King of &s;aints, yet lu&s;ts always retain the throne and dominion in their hearts, and they are &s;erving <HI>divers lu&s;ts and plea&s;ures,</HI> Tit. iii. 3. None but the&s;e in whom Chri&s;t is formed, do really put the crown on his head, and receive the kingdom of Chri&s;t within them. His crown is <HI>the crown wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of his e&s;pou&s;als.</HI> Who are they, whom the power of grace has not &s;ub|dued, that will allow him to &s;et up, and to put down, in their &s;ouls, as he will? Nay, as for others, any lord &s;hall &s;ooner get the rule over them, than <HI>the Lord of glory:</HI> they kindly entertain his enemies, and will never ab&s;olutely re&s;ign them&s;elves to his government, till con|quered in a day of power. Thus ye may &s;ee that the natural man is an enemy to Je&s;us Chri&s;t in all his offices.</P>
<P>But O! how hard is it to convince men in this point! They are very loth to take with it. And in a &s;pecial manner, the enmity of the heart again&s;t Chri&s;t in his prie&s;tly office, &s;eems to be hid from the view of mo&s;t of the hearers of the go&s;pel. Yet there appears to be a peculiar malignity in corrupt nature again&s;t that office of his. It may be ob&s;erved, that the <HI>Socinians,</HI> the&s;e enemies of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, allow him to be properly a <HI>Prophet</HI> and a <HI>King,</HI> but deny him to be properly a <HI>Prie&s;t.</HI> And this is agreeable enough to the corruption of our nature; for under the covenant of works, the Lord was known as a <HI>Prophet</HI> or <HI>Teacher,</HI> and al&s;o as a <HI>King</HI> or <HI>Ruler;</HI> but not at all as a <HI>Prie&s;t:</HI> &s;o man knows nothing of the my&s;tery of Chri&s;t, as <HI>the way to the Father,</HI> till it be revealed to him. And when it is revealed, the will ri&s;eth up again&s;t it; for corrupt nature lies cro&s;s to the my&s;tery of Chri&s;t, and the great contrivance of &s;alvation, through a crucified Saviour, revealed in the go&s;pel. For clearing of which weighty truth, let the&s;e four things be con&s;idered.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="045042_0069_101F7D4EF0AA4468"><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The &s;oul's falling in with the grand device of &s;alvation by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and &s;etting the matters of &s;alvation on that footing be|fore the Lord, is declared by the &s;criptures of truth to be an undoubt|ed mark of a real &s;aint, who is happy here, and &s;hall be happy here|after. Matth. xi. 6. <HI>And ble&s;&s;ed is he, who&s;oever &s;hall not be offended in me.</HI> 1 Cor. i. 23, 24. <HI>But we preach Chri&s;t crucified, unto the Jews a &s;tumbling block, and unto the Greeks fooli&s;hne&s;s: but unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Chri&s;t, the power of God, and the wi&s;dom of God.</HI> Philip iii. 3. <HI>For we are the circumci&s;ion which wor&s;hip God in the Spirit, and rejoice in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and have no confi|dence in the fle&s;h.</HI> Now how could this be, if nature could comply with that grand device.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Corrupt nature is the very rever&s;e of the go&s;pel contriv|ance. In the go&s;pel, God promi&s;eth Je&s;us Chri&s;t as the great means of re-uniting man to him&s;elf: he has named him as the Mediator, one <HI>in whom he is well plea&s;ed,</HI> and will have none but him, Matth. xvii. 5. But nature <HI>will have none of him,</HI> P&s;al lxxxi. 11 God appointed the place of meeting for the reconciliation, namely, <HI>the fle&s;h of Chri&s;t;</HI> accordingly, <HI>God was in Chri&s;t,</HI> (2 Cor. v. 29.) as the tabernacle of meeting, to make up the peace with &s;inners; but natural men, tho' they &s;hould die for ever, will not come thither John v. 40. <HI>And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.</HI> In the way of the go&s;pel, the &s;inner mu&s;t &s;tand before the Lord in an imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">d righteou&s;ne&s;s: but corrupt nature is for an inherent righteou&s;ne&s;s: and therefore, &s;o far as natural men follow after righteou&s;ne&s;s, they follow after the law of righteou&s;ne&s;s, Rom. ix 31, 32. and not after <HI>the Lord our righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Nature is always for building up it&s;elf, and to have &s;ome grounds for boa&s;ting: but the great de&s;ign of the go&s;pel is to exalt grace, to depre&s;s nature, and exclude boa&s;ting, Rom. iii 27. The &s;um of our natural religion is, to do good from and for our&s;elves, John v. 44. The &s;um of the go&s;pel religion is, to deny our&s;elves and to do good from and for Chri&s;t, Philip i. 21.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Every thing in nature is again&s;t believing in Je&s;us Chri&s;t. What beauty can the blind man di&s;cern in a crucified Saviour, for which he is to be de&s;ired? How can the will, naturally impotent, yea and aver&s;e to good, make choice of him? Well may the &s;oul then &s;ay to him in the day of the &s;piritual &s;iege, as the <HI>Jebu&s;ites</HI> &s;aid to <HI>David</HI> in another ca&s;e, <HI>Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou &s;halt not come in hither,</HI> 2 Sam. v. 6. The way of nature is to go into one's &s;elf for all; according to the fundamental maxim of un&s;anctified morality, <HI>That a man &s;hould tru&s;t in him&s;elf;</HI> which according to the doctrine of faith, is mere fooli&s;hne&s;s; for &s;o it is determined, Prov. xviii. 26. <HI>He that tru&s;teth in his own heart is a fool.</HI> Now faith is the &s;oul's going out of it&s;elf for all: and this nature, on the other hand, determines to be fooli&s;hne&s;s, 1 Cor. i. 18, 23. Wherefore there is need of the working of mighty power, to cau&s;e &s;inners to believe, Eph. i. 19. I&s;a. liii. 1. We &s;ee promi&s;es of welcome to &s;inners, in

the go&s;pel-covenant, are ample, large and free, clogg'd with no conditions, I&s;a. lv. 1. Rev. xxii. 17. If they cannot believe his bare word, he has given them his oath upon it, Ezek. xxxiii. 11. And for their greater a&s;&s;urance, he has appended &s;eals to his &s;worn covenant, namely, the holy &s;acraments. So that no more could be demanded of the mo&s;t faithle&s;s per&s;on in the world, to make us believe him, than the Lord hath conde&s;cended to give us, to make us believe him&s;elf. This plainly &s;peaks nature to be again&s;t believing, and the&s;e who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lee to Chri&s;t for refuge, to have need of &s;trong con&s;olation. (Heb vi. 18.) to blame their &s;trong doubts, and propen&s;ity to unbelief. Farther, al&s;o it may be ob&s;erved, how, in the word &s;ent to a &s;ecure, gracele&s;s generation, their objections are an&s;wered aforehand; and words of grace are heaped one upon another, as ye may read, I&s;a. lv. 7, 8, 9. Joel ii. 13. Why? Becau&s;e the Lord knows, that when the&s;e &s;ecure &s;inners are throughly wakned, doubts, fears, and carnal rea&s;onings again&s;t believing, will be going within their brea&s;ts, as thick as du&s;t in a hou&s;e, rai&s;ed by &s;weeping a dry floor.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">rupt nature is bent towards the way of the law, or covenant of works; and every natural man, &s;o far as he &s;ets him&s;elf to &s;eek after &s;alvation, is engaged in that way; and will not quit it, till beat from it by divine power. Now the way of &s;alvation by works, and that of free grace in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, are incon&s;i&s;tent, Rom. xi. 6. <HI>And if by grace; then it is no more of works; otherwi&s;e grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then it is no more grace; other|wi&s;e work is no more work.</HI> Gal. iii. 13. <HI>And the law is not of FAITH; but the man that DOTH them &s;hall live in them</HI> Wherefore, if the will of man naturally incline to the way of &s;alvation by the law; it lies cro&s;s to the go&s;pel contrivance. And that &s;uch is the natural bent of our hearts, will appear, if the&s;e following things be con&s;idered.</P>
<P N="1">1. The law was <HI>Adam</HI>'s covenant; and he knew no other, as he was the head and repre&s;entative of all mankind, that were brought into it with him, and le&s;t under it by him, tho' without &s;trength to perform the condition thereof. Hence, this covenant is ingrained in our nature: and tho' we have lo&s;t our father's &s;trength&punc; yet we &s;till incline to the way he was &s;et upon as our head and repre&s;entative in that covenant; that is, by doing to live.

grace and favour from heaven, whether to nations or particular per|&s;ons, have &s;till had &s;omething about them proclaiming a freedom of grace; as in the very fir&s;t &s;eparation made by the divine favour, <HI>Cain</HI> the elder brother is rejected, and <HI>Abel</HI> the younger accepted. This &s;hines through the whole hi&s;tory of the Bible: but as true as it is, this has been the point principally oppo&s;ed by corrupt nature. One may well &s;ay, that of all errors in religion, &s;ince Chri&s;t, the Seed of the woman was preached, this of works, in oppo&s;ition to free grace in him, was the fir&s;t that lived; and it is likely to be the la&s;t that dies. There have been va&s;t numbers of errors, which &s;prung up one after another, whereof, at length, the world became a&s;hamed and weary; &s;o that they died out. But this has continued, from <HI>Cain</HI> the fir&s;t author of this here&s;y, unto this day; and never wanted &s;ome that clave to it, even in the times of greate&s;t light. I do not without ground, call <HI>Cain</HI> the author of it; when <HI>Abel</HI> brought the &s;acrifice of atonement, a bloody offering of the fir&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ings of his flock, (like the Publican, <HI>&s;mit|ing on his brea&s;t,</HI> and &s;aying, <HI>God b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> merciful to me a &s;inner) Cain</HI> ad|vanced with his thank-offering <HI>of the fir&s;t fruit of the ground,</HI> (Gen. iv. 3, 4.) like the proud <HI>Phari&s;ee,</HI> with his <HI>God I thank thee.</HI> For what was the cau&s;e of <HI>Cain</HI>'s wrath, and of his murdering of <HI>Abel?</HI> Was it not that he was accepted of God for his work? Gen. iv. 4, 5. <HI>And wherefore &s;lew he him? Becau&s;e his own works were evil, and his brother</HI>'s <HI>righteous,</HI> (1 John iii. 22) that is, done in faith and accepted, when his were done without faith, and therefore rejected, as the Apo&s;tle teacheth, Heb. xi. 4. And &s;o he wrote his indignation again&s;t ju&s;ti|fication and acceptance with God, through faith, in oppo&s;ition to works, in the blood of his brother, to convey it down to pe&s;terity. And &s;ince that time, the unbloody &s;acrifice has often &s;wimmed in the blood of tho&s;e that rejected it. The promi&s;e made to <HI>Abraham</HI> of the Seed in which all nations &s;hould be ble&s;&s;ed, was &s;o overclouded among his po&s;terity in <HI>Egypt,</HI> that the generality of them &s;aw no need of that way of obtaining the ble&s;&s;ing, till God him&s;elf confuted their error, by a fiery law from Mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> which <HI>was added becau&s;e of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, till the Seed &s;hould come,</HI> Gal iii. 19.

of the pure&s;t liquor put into it, &s;o the natural man turns the very go&s;pel into law; and transforms the covenant of grace into a covenant of works The ceremonial law was to the <HI>Jews</HI> a real go&s;pel; which held blood, death, and tran&s;lation of guilt before their eyes continually, as the only way of &s;alvation: yet their very table (<HI>i e.</HI> their altar, with the &s;everal ordinances pertaining thereto, Mal i. 12) was <HI>a &s;nare unto them,</HI> Rom. ii. 9. while they u&s;e it to make up the defects in their obedience to the moral law, and clave to it &s;o, as to reject him whom the altar and &s;acrifices pointed them to, as the &s;ub&s;tance of all: even as <HI>Hagar,</HI> who&s;e it was only to &s;erve, was by their father brought into her mi&s;tre&s;s's bed; nor without a my&s;tery in the purpo&s;e of God, <HI>for the&s;e are the two covenants,</HI> Gal. iv. 24.

<HEAD>The Corruption of the Affections, the Con&s;cience and the Memory. The Body partaker of this corruption.</HEAD>
<P N="3">III. The <HI>Affections</HI> are corrupted. The unrenewed man's affec|tions are wholly di&s;ordered and di&s;tempered: they are as the unruly hor&s;e, that either will not receive, or violently runs away with the rider. So man's heart naturally is a mother of abominations. Mark vii. 21, 22. <HI>For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders, thefts, covetou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> &amp;c. The natural man's affections are wretchedly mi&s;placed; he is a &s;piritual mon&s;ter. His heart is there, where his feet &s;hould be, fixed on the earth; his heels are lifted up again&s;t heaven, which his heart &s;hould be &s;et on, Acts ix. 5. His face is towards hell, his back towards heaven; and therefore God calls him to turn. He loves what he &s;hould hate, and hates what he &s;hould love&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in what he ought to mourn for, and mourns for what he &s;hould rejoice in: glorieth in his &s;hame, and is a&s;hamed of his glory; abhors what he &s;hould de&s;ire, and de&s;ires what he &s;hould abhor, Prov. ii. 13.14.15. They hit the point indeed, (as <HI>Caiaphus</HI> did in another ca&s;e) who cried out on the apo&s;tles as men that <HI>turned the world up&s;ide-down,</HI> Acts xvii. 6. for that is the work the go&s;pel has has to do in the world, where &s;in has put all things &s;o out of order, that heaven lies under, and earth a-top. If the unre|newed man's affections be &s;et on lawful objects, then they are either exce&s;&s;ive, or defective. Lawful enjoyments of the world Love &s;ome|times

<P>Now, here is a three-fold cord again&s;t heaven and holine&s;s, not ea&s;ily broken; a blind mind, a perver&s;e will, and di&s;orderly di&s;tem|pered affections.

Thus the poor creature &s;tands out again&s;t God and goodne&s;s; till a day of power come, in which he is made a new creature</P>
<P N="4">IV. The <HI>Con&s;cience</HI> is corrupt and defiled, Tit i. 15. It is an evil eye, that fills one's conver&s;ation with much darkne&s;s and confu&s;ion; being naturally unable to do its office; till the Lord, by letting in a new light to the &s;oul, awaken the con&s;cience; it remains &s;leepy and unactive. Con&s;cience can never do its work, but according to the light it hath to work by. Wherefore &s;eeing the natural man cannot &s;pirit|ually di&s;cern &s;piritual things, (1 Cor. ii. 14.) the con&s;cience naturally is quite u&s;ele&s;s in that point: being ca&s;t into &s;uch a deep &s;leep, that nothing but a &s;aving illuminations from the Lord, can &s;et it on work in that matter. The light of the natural con&s;cience in good and evil, &s;in and duty, is very defective; therefore tho' it may check for gro&s;&s;er &s;ins; yet as to the more &s;ubtile workings of &s;in, it cannot check for them, becau&s;e it di&s;cerns them not. Thus con&s;cience will fly in the face of many, if at any time they be drunk, &s;wear, neglect prayer, or be guilty of any gro&s;s &s;in; who otherwi&s;e have a profound peace; tho' they live in the &s;in of unbelief, are &s;trangers to &s;piritual wor&s;hip, and the life of faith. And natural light being but faint and langui&s;hing in many things which it doth reach, con&s;cience in that ca&s;e &s;hoots like a &s;titch in one's &s;ide, which quickly goes off; its incitements to duty, and checks for and &s;truggles again&s;t &s;in, are very remi&s;s, which the natural man ea&s;ily gets over. But becau&s;e there is a fal&s;e light in the dark mind, the natural con&s;cience following the &s;ame will call <HI>evil good, and good evil,</HI> I&s;a. v. 20. And &s;o it is often found like a blind and furious hor&s;e, which doth violently run down him&s;elf, his rider, and all that doth come in his way, John xvi. 2. <HI>Who&s;oever kill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th you, will think that he doth God &s;ervice.</HI> When the natural con&s;cience is awak|ened by the Spirit of conviction, it will indeed rage and rore, and put the whole man in a dreadful con&s;ternation, awfully &s;ummon all the powers of the &s;oul to help in a &s;trait; make the &s;tiff heart to tremble, and the knees to bow; &s;et the eyes a-weeping, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;|ing; and oblige the man to ca&s;t out the goods into the &s;ea, which it apprehends are like to &s;ink the &s;hip of the &s;oul, tho' the heart <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> goes after them. But yet it is an evil con&s;cience, which natively leads to de&s;pair, and will do it effectually, as in <HI>Judas</HI>'s ca&s;e; unle&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> or lu&s;ts prevail over it, to lull it a&s;leep, as in the ca&s;e of <HI>Felix,</HI> Acts. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">v. 25.

or the Blood of CHRIST prevail over it, &s;prinkling and purging it from dead works, as in the ca&s;e of all true converts, Heb. ix. 14. &amp; x. 23.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> Even the <HI>Memory</HI> bears evident marks of this corruption. What is good and worthy to be minded, as it makes but &s;lender im|pre&s;&s;ion, &s;o that impre&s;&s;ion ea&s;ily wears off; the memory, as a leaking ve&s;&s;el, lets it &s;lip, Heb. ii. 1. As a &s;ieve that is full, when in the water, lets all go when it is taken out; &s;o is the memory, with re|&s;pect to &s;piritual things. But how does it retain what ought to be forgotten? Naughty things &s;o bear in them&s;elves upon it, that though men would fain have them out of mind, yet they &s;tick there like giue. However forgetful men be in in other things, it is hard to forget an injury. So the memory often furni&s;hes new fuel to old lu&s;ts; makes men in old age to re-act the &s;ins of their youth, while it pre&s;ents them again to the mind with delight, which thereupon licks up the former vomit. And thus it is like the riddle, that lets through the pure grain, and keeps the refu&s;e. Thus far of the corruption of the &s;oul.</P>
<P>The <HI>Body</HI> it&s;elf al&s;o is partaker of this corruption and defilement, &s;o far as it is capable thereof. Wherefore the Scripture calls it <HI>&s;inful fle&s;h,</HI> Rom. viii. 3. We may take this up in two things. (1.) The natural temper, or rather di&s;temper of the bodies of <HI>Adam</HI>'s children, as it is an effect of original &s;in; &s;o it hath a native tendency to &s;in, incites to &s;in, leads the &s;oul into &s;nares, yea, is it&s;elf a &s;nare to the &s;oul. The body is a furious bea&s;t, of &s;uch metal, that if it be not beat down, kept under, and brought into &s;ubjection, it will ca&s;t the &s;oul into much &s;in and mi&s;ery, 1 Cor. ix. 27. There's a vilene&s;s in the body, (Phil. iii. 21.) which, as to the &s;aints, will never be removed, until it be melted down in a grave, and ca&s;t into a new mould, at the re&s;urrection to come forth a &s;piritual body: and will never be carried off from the bodies of tho&s;e, who are not partakers of the re&s;urrection to life. (2.) It &s;erves the &s;oul in many &s;ins. Its members are in|&s;truments or weapons of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, whereby men fight again&s;t God, Rom. vi. 13. The eyes and ears are open doors, by which impure motions and &s;inful de&s;ires enter the &s;oul; <HI>the tongue is a world of iniquity;</HI> James iii. 6. <HI>an unruly evil, full of deadly poi&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n,</HI> ver. 8. By it the impure heart vents a great deal of its filthine&s;s. <HI>The throat is an open &s;epulchre,</HI> Rom. iii. 13. The feet run the devil's errands, ver. 15. The belly is made a god, Philip, iii. 19. Not only by drunkards and riotous livers, but by every natural man, Zech. vii. 6. So the body naturally is an agent for the devil; and a magazine of armour again&s;t the Lord.</P>
<P>To conclude, man by nature is wholly corrupted: <HI>From the &s;ole of the foot, even unto the head, there is no &s;oundne&s;s in him.</HI> And as in a dunghill, every part contributes to the corruption of the whole; &s;o the natural man, while in that &s;tate, grows &s;till wor&s;e and wor&s;e. The &s;oul is made wor&s;e by the body, and the body by the &s;oul: and every faculty of the &s;oul &s;erves to corrupt another more and more. Thus much for the &s;econd general Head.</P>

<HEAD>How Man's Nature was corrupted.</HEAD>
<P>THIRDLY, I &s;hall &s;hew how man's nature comes to be thus cor|rupted. The heathens perceived that man's nature was corrupted: but how &s;in had entred, they could not tell. But the Scripture is very plain in that point, Rom. v. 12. <HI>By one man &s;in entered into the world.</HI> Ver. 19. <HI>By one man</HI>'s <HI>di&s;obedience, many were made &s;inners. Adam</HI>'s &s;in corrupted man's nature, and leavened the whole lump of mankind. We putrified in <HI>Adam,</HI> as our root. The root was poi&s;|oned, and &s;o the branches were envenomed; the vine turned the <HI>vine of Sodom,</HI> and &s;o the grapes became <HI>grapes of gall. Adam,</HI> by his &s;in, became not only guilty, but corrupt; and &s;o tran&s;mits guilt and cor|ruption to his po&s;terity, Gen. v. 3. Job xiv. 4. By his &s;in he &s;tript him&s;elf of his original righteou&s;ne&s;s, and corrupted him&s;elf: we were in him repre&s;entatively, being repre&s;ented by him, as our moral head, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n the covenant of works; we were in him &s;eminally, as our natural head; hence we fell in him, and by his di&s;obedience, were made &s;inners, as <HI>Levi,</HI> in the loins of <HI>Abraham</HI> paid tithes, Heb. vii. 9, 10. His fir&s;t &s;in is imputed to us; therefore ju&s;tly are we left under the want of his original righteou&s;ne&s;s, which, being given to him as a common per&s;on, he ca&s;t off, by his &s;in; and this is nece&s;&s;arily followed, in him and us, by the corruption of the whole nature; righteou&s;ne&s;s and corruption being two contraries, one of which mu&s;t needs always be in man, as a &s;ubject capable thereof. And <HI>Adam</HI> our common father being corrupt, we are &s;o too; for <HI>who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?</HI></P>
<P>Although it is &s;ufficient to evince <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> righteou&s;ne&s;s of this di&s;pen|&s;ation, that it was from the Lord, who doth all things well; yet to &s;ilence the murmurings of proud nature, let the&s;e few things further be con&s;idered, (1.) In the covenant wherein <HI>Adam</HI> repre&s;ented us, eternal happine&s;s was promi&s;ed to him and his po&s;terity upon condi|tion of his, that is, <HI>Adam</HI>'s perfect obedience, as the repre&s;entative for all mankind: whereas, if there had been no covenant, they could not have pleaded eternal life, upon their mo&s;t perfect obedience, but might have be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, after all, reduced to nothing, notwith&s;tanding, by natural ju&s;tice, they would have been liable to God's eternal wrath, in ca&s;e of &s;in. Who in that ca&s;e would not have con&s;ented to that repre&s;en|tation? (2.) <HI>Adam</HI> had a power to &s;tand given him, being made up|right. He was as capable to &s;tand for him&s;elf, and all his po&s;terity, as any after him could be for them&s;elves. This trial of mankind, in their head, would &s;oon have been over, and the crown won to them all, had he &s;tood; whereas, had his po&s;terity been independent on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, and every one left to act for him&s;elf, the trial would have been continually a carrying on, as men came into the world. (3.) He had natural affections the &s;tronge&s;t to engage him, being our common <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ather. (4.) His own &s;tock was in the &s;hip, his all lay at &s;take as well

as ours. He had no &s;eparate intere&s;t from ours; but if he forgot ours, he behoved to have forgot ours, he behoved to have forgot his own. (5.) If he had &s;tood, we &s;hould have had the light of his mind, the righteou&s;ne&s;s of his will, and holine&s;s of his affections, with entire purity tran&s;mitted unto us; we could not have fallen; the crown of glory, by his obedience, would have been for ever &s;ecured to him and his. This is evident from the nature of a federal repre&s;entation; and no rea&s;on can be given why, &s;eeing we are lo&s;t by <HI>Adam</HI>'s &s;in, we &s;hould not have been &s;aved by his obedience. On the other hand, it is rea&s;onable, that he falling, we &s;hould, with him, bear the lo&s;s. <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> Such as quarrel this di&s;pen&s;ation, mu&s;t renounce their part in Chri&s;t; for we are no otherwi&s;e made &s;inners by <HI>Adam,</HI> than we are made righteous by Chri&s;t; from whom we have both imputed and inherent righteou&s;ne&s;s. We no more made choice of the &s;econd <HI>Adam,</HI> for our head and repre&s;entative in the &s;econd covenant; than we did of the fir&s;t <HI>Adam</HI> in the fir&s;t covenant.</P>
<P>Let none wonder that &s;uch an horrible change would be brought on by one &s;in of our fir&s;t parents, for thereby they turned away from God, as their chief end, which nece&s;&s;arily infers an univer&s;al deprava|tion. Their &s;in was a complication of evils, a total apo&s;ta&s;y from God, a violation of the whole law. By it they broke all the ten commands at once. (1.) They cho&s;e new gods. They made their belly their god, by their &s;en&s;uality: &s;elf their god, by their ambition; yea, and the devil their god, believing him, and di&s;believing their Maker. (2.) Tho' they received, yet they ob&s;erved not that ordinance of God, about the forbidden fruit. They contemned that ordinance &s;o plainly enjoined them, and would needs carve out to them&s;elves, how to &s;erve the Lord. (3.) They took the name of the Lord their God in vain: de&s;pi&s;ing his attributes, his ju&s;tice, truth, power, &amp;c. They gro&s;ly profaned that &s;acramental tree; abu&s;ed his word, by not giving credit to it; abu&s;ed that creature of his, which they &s;hould not have touched, and violently mi&s;con&s;trued his providence; as if God, by forbidding them that tree, had been &s;tanding in the way of their happine&s;s; and therefore he &s;uffered them not to e&s;cape his righteous judgment. (4.) They remembered not the Sabbath to keep it holy, but put them&s;elves out of a condition to &s;erve God aright on his own day. Neither kept they that &s;tate of holy re&s;t, wherein God had put them. (5.) They ca&s;t off their relative duties. <HI>Eve</HI> forgets her&s;elf, and acts without advice of her hu&s;band, to the ruin of both; <HI>Adam</HI> in&s;tead of admoni&s;hing her to repent, yields to the temptation, and confirms her in her wickedne&s;s. They forgot all duty to their po&s;terity. They honoured not their Father in heaven; and therefore their days were not long in the land which the Lord their God gave them. (6.) They ruined them&s;elves, and all their po&s;terity. (7.) Gave up them&s;elves to luxury and &s;en&s;uality (8.) Took away what was not their own, again&s;t the expre&s;s will of the great Owner. (9.) They bore fal&s;e witne&s;s, and lied again&s;t

the Lord, before angels, devils, and one another; in effect giving out that they were hardly dealt by, and that heaven grudged their hap|pine&s;s. (10.) They were di&s;content with their lot, and coveted an evil covetou&s;ne&s;s to their hou&s;e; which ruined both them and theirs. Thus was the image of God on man defaced all at once.</P>

<HEAD>The Doctrine of the Corruption of Nature applied.</HEAD>
<P>USE I. For <HI>Information.</HI> Is man's nature wholly corrupted? Then,</P>
<P N="1">1. No wonder the grave open it's devouring mouth for us, as &s;oon as the womb hath ca&s;t us forth; and that the cradle be turned into a coffin, to receive the corrupt lump: for we are all, in a &s;piritual &s;en&s;e, dead born; yea, and filthy, (P&s;al. xiv. 3.) noi&s;ome, rank, and &s;tinking as a corrupt thing, as the word imports. Let us not complain of the mi&s;eries we are expo&s;ed to, at our entrance, nor of the continuance of them, while we are in the world. Here is the venom that has poi&s;oned all the &s;prings of earthly enjoyments we have to drink of. It is the corruption of man's nature, that brings forth all the mi&s;eries of human life in churches, &s;tates, families: in men's &s;ouls and bodies.</P>
<P N="2">2. Behold here, as in a gla&s;s, the &s;pring of all the wickedne&s;s, profanity, and formality in the world; the &s;ource of all the di&s;orders in thy own heart and life. Every thing acts like it&s;elf, agreeable to its own nature; and &s;o corrupt man acts corruptly. You need not wonder at the &s;infulne&s;s of your own heart and life, nor at the &s;inful|ne&s;s and perver&s;ene&s;s of others: if a man be crooked, he cannot but halt; and if the clock be &s;et wrong, how can it point the hour right.</P>
<P N="3">3. See here, why &s;in is &s;o plea&s;ant, and religion &s;uch a burden to carnal &s;pirits: &s;in is natural, holine&s;s not &s;o. Oxen cannot feed in the &s;ea, nor fi&s;hes in the fruitful fields. A &s;wine brought into a palace, would get away again, to wallow in the mire. A corrupt nature tends ever to impurity.</P>
<P N="4">4. Learn from this, the nature and nece&s;&s;ity of regeneration. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> This di&s;covers the nature of regeneration in the&s;e two things, (1.) It is not a partial, but a total change, tho' imperfect in this life. Thy whole nature is corrupted, and therefore the cure mu&s;t go thro' every part. Regeneration makes not only a new head for knowledge, but a new heart, and new affections for holine&s;s. <HI>All things become new,</HI> 2 Cor. v. 17. If one who has received many wounds, &s;hould be cured of them all, &s;ave one only, he might bleed to death, by that one, as well as a thou&s;and. So if the change go not through the whole man, it is naught. (2.) It is not a change made by human indu&s;try, but by the mighty power of the Spirit of God. A man mu&s;t be <HI>born of the Spirit,</HI> John iii. 5 Accidental di&s;ea&s;es may be cured by men, but the&s;e which are natural, not without a miracle, John ix. 22. The change wrought upon men, by good education, or forced upon them, by a natural con&s;cience, tho' it may pa&s;s among men for a &s;av<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing
<PB N="85" REF="045042_0082_101F7D823749B3A8">
change, it is not &s;o; for our nature is corrupt, and none but the God of nature can change it. Tho' a gardiner, ingrafting a pear branch into an apple tree, may make the apple-tree bear pears; yet the art of man cannot change the nature of the apple-tree: &s;o one may pin a new life to his old heart, but he can never change the heart. <HI>Secondly,</HI> This al&s;o &s;hews the nece&s;&s;ity of regeneration. It is ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary in order to &s;alvation, John iii. 3 <HI>Except a man be born again, he cannot &s;ee the kingdom of God.</HI> No unclean thing can enter the new <HI>Jeru&s;alem:</HI> but thou art wholly unclean, while in thy natural &s;tate. If every member of thy body were disjointed, each joint behoved to be loo&s;ed, ere the members could be &s;et aright again. This is the ca&s;e of thy &s;oul, as thou ha&s;t heard: and therefore thou mu&s;t be <HI>born again;</HI> el&s;e thou &s;halt never &s;ee heaven, unle&s;s it be far off, as the rich man in hell did. Deceive not thy&s;elf: no Mercy of GOD, no Blood of CHRIST will bring thee to heaven, in thy unre|generate &s;tate: for God will never open a fountain of mercy, to wa&s;h away his own holine&s;s and truth: nor did Chri&s;t &s;hed his precious <HI>blood,</HI> to blot out the truths of God, or to overturn God's mea&s;ures about the &s;alvation of &s;inners. Heaven! What would you do there, that are not <HI>born again?</HI> Ye that are no ways fitting for Chri&s;t the head. That would be a &s;trange &s;ight, a holy head, and members <HI>wholly corrupt!</HI> a head full of trea&s;ures of grace, members wherein are nothing but trea&s;ures of wickedne&s;s! a head obedient to death, and heels kicking again&s;t heaven! Ye are no ways adapted to the &s;ociety above, more than bea&s;ts for conver&s;e with men. Thou art a hater of true holine&s;s: and at the fir&s;t &s;ight of a &s;aint there, would cry out, <HI>Ha&s;t thou found me, O mine enemy!</HI> Nay, the unrenewed man, if it were po&s;&s;ible he could go to heaven, in that &s;tate, he would no otherwi&s;e go to it, than now he comes to the duties of holine&s;s, that is, leaving his heart behind him.</P>
<P>USE II. For <HI>Lamentation.</HI> Well may we lament thy ca&s;e, O na|tural man, for it is the &s;adde&s;t ca&s;e one can be in, out of hell. It is time to lament for thee; for thou art dead already, dead whil&s;t thou live&s;t; thou carrie&s;t about with thee a dead &s;oul in a living body: and becau&s;e thou art dead, thou can&s;t not lament thy own ca&s;e. Thou art loath&s;ome in the &s;ight of God; for thou art altogether corrupt. Thou <HI>ha&s;t no good</HI> in thee; thy &s;oul is a ma&s;s of darkne&s;s, rebellion, and vilene&s;s before the Lord. Thou thinke&s;t, perhaps, that thou ha&s;t a good heart to God, good inclinations, and good de&s;ires: but God knows there is nothing good in thee, but <HI>every imagination of thine heart is only evil.</HI> Thou <HI>can&s;t do no good;</HI> thou can&s;t do nothing but &s;in. For,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Thou art <HI>the &s;ervant of &s;in,</HI> Rom. vi. 17. and therefore <HI>free from righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> ver. 20. Whatever righteou&s;ne&s;s be, (poor &s;oul) thou art free of it; thou do&s;t not, thou can&s;t not meddle with it. Thou art under the dominion of &s;in, a dominion where righteou&s;ne&s;s can have no place. Thou art a child and &s;ervant of the devil, tho'
<PB N="86" REF="045042_0083_101F443D01BA6DB8">
thou be neither wizzard nor witch: &s;eeing thou art yet in the &s;tate of nature, John viii. 44 <HI>Ye are of your father the devil.</HI> And to prevent any mi&s;take, con&s;ider, that &s;in and Satan have two &s;orts of &s;ervants, (1.) There are &s;ome employed, as it were, in coar&s;er work: tho&s;e bear the devil's mark in their fore-heads, having no form of godline&s;s; but are profane, gro&s;ly ignorant, mere morali&s;ts, not &s;o much as performing the external duties of religion, but living to the view of the world; as &s;ons of earth, only <HI>minding earthly things,</HI> Philip. iii. 19. (2) There are &s;ome employed in a more refined &s;ort of &s;ervice to &s;in, who carry the devil's mark in their right hand; which they can, and do hide from the view of the world. The&s;e are clo&s;s hypocrites, who &s;acrifice as much to the corrupt mind, as the other to the fle&s;h, Eph. ii. 3. The&s;e are ruined by a more un|di&s;cernable trade of &s;in: pride, unbelief, &s;elf-&s;eeking, and the like, &s;warm in, and prey upon their corrupted, wholly corrupted &s;ouls. Both are &s;ervants of the &s;ame hou&s;e; the latter as far as the former from righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> How is it po&s;&s;ible thou &s;hould&s;t be able to do any good, thou who&s;e nature is wholly corrupt? Can fruit grow where there is no root? Or, can there be an effect without a cau&s;e? <HI>Can the fig-tree bear olive berries? Either a vine figs?</HI> If thy nature be wholly corrupt, as indeed it is, all thou do&s;t is certainly &s;o too; for no effect can ex|ceed the virtue of its cau&s;e. <HI>Can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit?</HI> Matth. vii. 18.</P>
<P>Ah! What a mi&s;erable &s;pectacle is he that can do nothing but &s;in? Thou art the man, who&s;oever thou art, that art yet in thy natural &s;tate. Hear, O &s;inner, what is thy ca&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Innumerable &s;ins compa&s;s thee about. Mountains of guilt are lying upon thee. Floods of impurities overwhelm thee. Living lu&s;ts of all &s;orts roll up and down in the dead &s;ea of thy &s;oul; where no good can breathe, becau&s;e of the corruption there. Thy lips are unclean: the opening of thy mouth is as the opening of an unripe grave, full of &s;tench and rottenne&s;s, Rom. iii. 13. <HI>Their throat is an open &s;epulchre.</HI> Thy natural actions are &s;in, for <HI>when ye did eat, and when ye did drink, did not ye eat for your&s;elves; and drink for your&s;elves?</HI> Zech. vii. 6. Thy civil actions are &s;in, Prov. xxi. 4. <HI>The plowing of the wicked is &s;in.</HI> Thy religious actions are &s;in, Prov. xv. 8. <HI>The &s;acrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord.</HI> The thoughts and imaginations of thy heart, are only evil. A deed may be &s;oon done, a word &s;oon &s;poken, a thought &s;wiftly pa&s;&s;eth through the heart: but each of the&s;e is an Item in thy accounts. O &s;ad reckoning! as many thoughts, words, actions; as many &s;ins. The longer thou live&s;t, thy accounts &s;well the more. Should a tear be dropt for every &s;in, thine head behoved to be waters, and thine <HI>eyes a fountain of tears;</HI> for nothing but &s;in comes from thee. Thy heart frames nothing but <HI>evil imaginations;</HI> there is nothing in thy life, but what is framed by thine heart; and therefore there is nothing in thy heart or life but evil.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="045042_0084_101F7D852077BCB0"><HI>Secondly,</HI> All thy religion, if thou ha&s;t any, is lo&s;t labour; as to acceptance with God, or any &s;aving effect to thy&s;elf. Art thou yet in thy natural &s;tate? Truly then thy duties are &s;ins, as was ju&s;t now hinted. Would not the be&s;t wine be loth&s;ome in a <HI>ve&s;&s;el wherein there is no plea&s;ure?</HI> So is the religion of an unregenerate man. Under the law: the garment which the fle&s;h of the &s;acrifice was car|ried in, tho' it touched other things, did not make them holy: but he that was unclean touching any thing, whether common or &s;acred, made it unclean. Even &s;o thy duties cannot make thy corrupt &s;oul holy, tho' they in them&s;elves be good; but thy corrupt heart defiles them, and makes them unclean, Hag. ii. 12, 13, 14. Thou wa&s;t went to divide thy works into two &s;orts; &s;ome good, &s;ome evil; but th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u mu&s;t count again and put them all under one head; for God writes on them all, <HI>only evil.</HI> This is lamentable: It will be no wonder to &s;ee tho&s;e beg in harve&s;t, who fold their hands to &s;leep in &s;eed time: but to be labouring with others in the &s;pring, and yet have nothing to reap when the harve&s;t comes, is a very &s;ad ca&s;e; and will be the ca&s;e of all profe&s;&s;ors living and dying in their natural &s;tate.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> Thou can&s;t not help thy&s;elf. What can&s;t thou do to take away thy &s;in, who art wholly corrupt? Nothing truly but &s;in. If a natural man begin to relent, drop a tear for his &s;in and reform, pre|&s;ently the corrupt heart apprehends, at lea&s;t, a merit of congruity: he has done much him&s;elf, (he thinks) and God cannot but do more for him on that account. In the mean time he does nothing but &s;in: &s;o that the congruous merit is the leper that mu&s;t be put out of the camp; the dead &s;oul buried out of &s;ight: and the corrupt lump ca&s;t into the pit. How can&s;t thou think to recover thy&s;elf by any thing thou can&s;t do? Will mud and filth wa&s;h out filthine&s;s? and wilt thou purge out &s;in by &s;inning? <HI>Job</HI> took a pot&s;herd to &s;crape him&s;elf, becau&s;e his hands were as full of boils as his body. This is the ca&s;e of thy corrupt &s;oul: not to be recovered but by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who&s;e &s;trength was dried up like a pot&s;herd, P&s;al. xxii. 15. Thou art poor indeed, extremely mi&s;erable and poor, Rev. iii. 17. Thou ha&s;t no &s;halter but a refuge of lies; no garment for thy &s;oul, but filthy rags; nothing to nouri&s;h it but hu&s;ks that cannot &s;atisfy. More than that, thou ha&s;t got &s;uch a brui&s;e in the loins of <HI>Adam,</HI> which is not yet cured, that thou art without &s;trength, Rom. v 6. unable to do or work for thy&s;elf; nay, more than all this, thou can&s;t not &s;o much as &s;eek aright, but lie&s;t helple&s;s, as an infant expo&s;ed in the open field, Ezek. xvi. 5.</P>
<P>USE III. I exhort you to believe this &s;ad truth. Alas! it is evident, it is very little believed in the world. Few are concerned to get their corrupt conver&s;ation changed; but fewer, by far, to get their nature changed: Mo&s;t men know not what they are, nor what &s;pirits they are of: they are as the eye, which &s;eeing many things, never &s;ees it&s;elf. But until ye know, every one the plague of his own heart, there is no hope of your recovery. Why will you not believe it? Ye have plain &s;cripture-te&s;timony for it; but you are loth to entertain

&s;uch an ill opinion of your&s;elves. Alas! that is the nature of your di&s;ea&s;e, Rev. iii. 17. <HI>Thou&mdash;knowe&s;t not that thou art wretched, and mi&s;erable, and poor, and blind, and naked.</HI> Lord open their eyes to &s;ee it, before they die of it; and in hell lift up their eyes, and &s;ee what they will not &s;ee now.</P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;hut up this weighty point of the corruption of man's nature, with a few words to another doctrine from the text.</P>
<P>DOCTRINE <HI>God takes &s;pecial notice of our natural corruption, or the &s;in of our nature.</HI> This he te&s;tifies two ways, 1. By his word, as in the text. <HI>God &s;aw&mdash;that every imagination of the thoughts of man's heart was enly evil continually</HI>&punc; See P&s;al xiv. 2, 3&punc; 2. By his works. God writes his particular notice of it, and di&s;plea&s;ure with it, as in many of his works, &s;o e&s;pecially in the&s;e two:</P>
<P N="1">(1.) In the death of the infant children of men. Many mi&s;eries they have been expo&s;ed to: they were drowned in the deluge, con|&s;umed in <HI>Sodom</HI> by fire and brim&s;tone; they have been &s;lain with the &s;word, da&s;hed again&s;t the &s;tones, and are &s;till dying ordinary deaths. What is the true cau&s;e of this? On what ground doth a holy God thus pur&s;ue them? Is it the &s;in of their parents? That may be the occa&s;ion of the Lord's rai&s;ing the proce&s;s again&s;t them: but it mu&s;t be their own &s;in that is the ground of the &s;entence pa&s;&s;ing on them: for <HI>the &s;oul that &s;inneth, it &s;hall die,</HI> &s;aith God, Ezek. xviii. 4. Is it their own actual &s;in? They have none. But as men do with toads and &s;erpents, which they kill at fir&s;t &s;ight, before they have done any hurt, becau&s;e of their venomous nature, &s;o is it in this ca&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">(2) In the birth of the elect children of God. When the Lord is about to change their nature, he makes the &s;in of their nature ly heavy on their &s;pirits. When he mind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to let out the corruption, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> gets full depth in their &s;ouls, reaching to the root of &s;in, Rom. vii. 7, 8, 9. The fle&s;h, or corruption of nature is pierced, being crucified, as well as the affections and lu&s;ts, Gal v. 24</P>
<P>USE. Let us then have a &s;pecial eye upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> corruption and &s;in of our nature. God &s;ees it: O that we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, and that &s;in were ever before us!

Turn your eyes inward to the &s;in of your nature. It is to be feared, many have this work to begin yet; that they have &s;hut the door, while the grand thief is yet in the hou&s;e undi&s;covered. This is a weighty point; and in the handling of it,</P>
<P N="1">I. I &s;hall, for conviction, point at &s;ome evidences of men's over|looking the &s;in of their nature, which yet the Lord takes particular notice of, (1.)

(3.) There are not a few, who, if they be kept from affliction in worldly things, and from gro&s;s out-breakings in their conver&s;ation, know not what it is to have a &s;ad heart. If they meet with a cro&s;s, which their proud hearts cannot &s;toop to bear, they will be ready to &s;ay, O to be gone: but the corruption of their nature never makes them long for heaven. Lu&s;ts &s;candalou&s;ly breaking out at a time, will mar their peace: but the &s;in of their nature never makes them a heavy heart. (4.) Delaying of repentance, in hopes to &s;et about it afterwards. Many have their own appointed time for repentance and reformation: as if they were &s;uch complete ma&s;ters over their lu&s;ts, that they can allow them to gather more &s;trength, and yet over|come them. They take up re&s;olutions to amend, without an eye to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, union with him, and &s;trength from him; a plain evidence they are &s;trangers to them&s;elves; and &s;o they are left to them&s;elves, and their flouri&s;hing re&s;olutions wither; for as they &s;ee not the ne|ce&s;&s;ity, &s;o they get not the benefit of the dew from heaven to water them. (5.) Men's venturing frankly on temptations and promi&s;ing liberally on their own heads. They ca&s;t them&s;elves fearle&s;ly into temptation, in confidence of their coming off fairly: but were they &s;en&s;ible of the corruption of their nature, they would beware of en|tering on the devil's ground: as one girt about with bag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of gun-powder, would be loth to walk where &s;parks of fire are flying, le&s;t he &s;hould be blown up.

The bias of the heart to the way of the covenant of works, is a hidden plague of the heart to many. All the difficulty they find is, in getting up their hearts to duties: they find no difficulty in getting their hearts off them, and over them to Je&s;us Chri&s;t. How hard is it to &s;tave men off from their own righteou&s;ne&s;s? Yet it is very hard to convince them of their leaning to it at all. <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> Pride and &s;elf-conceit. A view of the <HI>corruption of nature</HI> would be very humbling; and oblige him that has it, to reckon him&s;elf the <HI>chief of &s;inners.</HI> Under the greate&s;t attainments and enlargements, it would be balla&s;t to his heart, and <HI>hide pride from his eyes.</HI> The want of thorough humiliation, piercing to the &s;in of one's nature, is the ruin of many profe&s;&s;ors: for digging deep makes great difference betwixt wi&s;e and fooli&s;h builders, Luke vi. 48, 49.</P>
<P N="2">II. I will lay before you a few things, in which ye &s;hould have a &s;pecial eye to the &s;in of your nature. (1.) Have a &s;pecial eye to it in your application to Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Do you find any need of Chri&s;t, which &s;ends you to him as the Phy&s;ician of &s;ouls? O forget not your di&s;ea&s;e when you are with the Phy&s;ician. They never yet knew well their errand to Chri&s;t, that went not to him for the &s;in of their nature: for his blood to take away the guilt of it, and his Spirit to break the power of it. Tho' in the bitterne&s;s of your &s;ouls, you &s;hould lay before him a catalogue of your &s;ins of ommi&s;&s;ion and com|mi&s;&s;ion, which might reach from earth to heaven; yet if the &s;in of your nature were wanting in it, a&s;&s;ure your&s;elves, you have forgot the be&s;t part of the errand a poor &s;inner has to the Phy&s;ician of &s;ouls. What would it have availed the people of <HI>Jericho,</HI> to have &s;et before <HI>Eli&s;ha</HI> all the ve&s;&s;els in their city full of <HI>the water that was naught,</HI> if they had not led him forth to the &s;pring, to ca&s;t in the &s;alt there? 2 Kings ii. 19.20, 21. The application is ea&s;y. (2.) Have a &s;pecial eye towards it in your repentance, whether initial or progre&s;&s;ive, in your fir&s;t repentance, and in the renewing of your repentance, after|wards. Tho' a man be &s;ick, there is no fear of death, if the &s;ickne&s;s &s;trike not his heart; and there is as little fear of the death of &s;in, as long as the &s;in of our nature is not touched. But if ye would repent indeed, let the &s;treams lead you up to the fountain; and mourn over your corrupt nature, as the cau&s;e of all &s;in, in heart, lip, and life. P&s;al. li. 4, 5. <HI>Again&s;t thee, thee only have I &s;inned, and none this evil in thy &s;ight &mdash; Behold, I was &s;hapen in iniquity, and in &s;in did my mother conceive me.</HI> (4.) Have a &s;pecial eye upon it, in your mortification. Gal. v. 24. <HI>And they that are Chri&s;t's have crucified the fle&s;h.</HI> It is the root of bitterne&s;s, that mu&s;t be &s;truck at, which the ax of mortifi|cation mu&s;t be laid to; el&s;e we labour in vain. In vain do men go
<PB N="91" REF="045042_0088_101F7D9632DBAF10">
about to purge the &s;treams, while they are at no pains about the muddy fountain: It is vain religion to attempt to make the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> truly good, while the corruption of nature retains its ancient vigour, and the power of it is not broken. <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> Ye are to eye it in your daily walk. He that would walk aright, mu&s;t have one eye upwards to Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and another inward to the corruption of his own nature. It is not enough that we look about us, we mu&s;t al&s;o look within us. There the wall is weake&s;t: there our greate&s;t enemy lies; and there are grounds for daily watching and mourning.</P>
<P N="3">III. I &s;hall offer &s;ome rea&s;ons, why we &s;hould e&s;pecially notice the &s;in of our nature.</P>
<P N="1">1. Becau&s;e of all &s;ins it is the mo&s;t exten&s;ive and diffu&s;ive. It goes through the whole man, and &s;poils all. Other &s;ins mar particular parts of the image of God; but this doth at once deface the whole. A di&s;ea&s;e affecting any particular member of the body is ill; but that which affects the whole is wor&s;e. The corruption of nature is the poi&s;on of the old &s;erpent, ca&s;t into the fountain of action: and &s;o infects every action, every breathing of the &s;oul.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is the cau&s;e of all particular lu&s;ts, and actual &s;ins, in our hearts and lives. It is the &s;pawn which the great <HI>Leviathan</HI> has left in the &s;ouls of men; from whence comes all the fry of actual &s;ins and abo|minations. Mark vii. 21. <HI>Out of the heart of men proceed evil thoughts, adulteries,</HI> &amp;c. It is the bitter fountain: particular lu&s;ts are but rivulets running from it: which bring forth into the life, a part only, and not the whole of what is within. Now the fountain is &s;till above the &s;treams: &s;o where the water is good, it is be&s;t in the fountain&punc; where it is ill, it is wor&s;t there. The corruption of nature being that which defiles all, it&s;elf mu&s;t needs be the mo&s;t abominable thing.</P>
<P N="3">3. It Is virtually all &s;in: for it is the &s;eed of all &s;ins which want but the occa&s;ion to &s;et up their heads: being in the corruption of nature, as the effect in the virtue of its cau&s;e. Hence it is called <HI>a body of death,</HI> (Rom. vii. 24) as con&s;i&s;ting of the &s;everal members, belonging to &s;uch <HI>a body of &s;ins,</HI> (Col ii 11.) who&s;e life lies in &s;piritual death. It is the cur&s;ed ground, fit to bring forth all manner of noxi|ous weeds. As the whole ne&s;t of venemous creatures mu&s;t needs be more dreadful, than any few of them that come creeping forth; &s;o the &s;in of thy nature, that mother of abominations mu&s;t be wor&s;e than any particular lu&s;ts, that appear &s;tirring in thy heart and life. Never did every &s;in appear in the conver&s;ation of the vile&s;t wretch that ever lived; but look thou into thy corrupt nature, and there thou maye&s;t &s;ee all and every &s;in in the &s;eed and root thereof. There is a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">lne&s;s of all unrighteou&s;ne&s;s there, Rom. i.29. There is athei&s;m, idolatry, bla&s;phemy, murder, adultery, and what&s;oever is vile. Po&s;&s;ibly none of the&s;e appear to thee in thy heart: but there is more in that un|fathomable depth of wickedne&s;s, than thou knowe&s;t. Thy corrupt heart is like an ant's ne&s;t, on which, while the &s;tone lieth, none of them appear: but take off the &s;tone, &s;tir them up, but with the point
<PB N="92" REF="045042_0089_101F7D9932125FE8">
of a &s;traw, you will &s;ee what a &s;warm is there, and how lively they be Ju&s;t &s;uch a &s;ight would thy heart afford thee, did the Lord but withdraw the re&s;traint he has upon it, and &s;uffer Satan to &s;tir it up by temptation.</P>
<P N="4">4.The &s;in of our nature is, of all &s;ins, the mo&s;t fixed and abiding. Sinful actions, tho' the guilt and &s;tain of them may remain, yet in them&s;elves they are pa&s;&s;ing. The drunkard is not always at his cup, nor the unclean per&s;on always acting lewdne&s;s. But the corruption of nature is an abiding &s;in: it remains with men in its full power by night and by day, at all times, fixed as with bands of iron and bra&s;s: till their nature be changed by converting grace; and the remains of it continue with the godly, until the death of the body. Pride, envy, covetou&s;ne&s;s, and the like, are not always &s;tirring in thee. But the proud, envious, carnal nature is &s;till with thee: even as the clock that is wrong, is not always &s;triking wrong; but the wrong &s;et continues with it, without great intermi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P N="5">5. It is the great reigning &s;in, Rom. vi. 12. <HI>Let not &s;in therefore reign in your mortal body, that you &s;hould obey it in the lu&s;ts thereof.</HI> There are three things you may ob&s;erve in the corrupt heart. (1.) There is the corrupt nature; the corrupt &s;et of the heart whereby men are unapt for all good, and fitted for all evil. This the apo&s;tle here calls, &s;in which reigns. (2.) There are particular lu&s;ts, or di&s;po&s;itions of that corrupt nature, which the Apo&s;tle calls the lu&s;ts thereof; &s;uch as pride, covetou&s;ne&s;s, <HI>&amp;c</HI> (3.) There is one among the&s;e, which is (like <HI>Saul</HI> among&s;t the people) higher by far than the re&s;t, namely, <HI>the &s;in which doth &s;o ea&s;ily be&s;et us,</HI> Heb. xii. 1. This we u&s;ually call the predominate &s;in, becau&s;e it doth, as it were, reign over other particular lu&s;ts; &s;o that other lu&s;ts mu&s;t yield to it. The&s;e three are like a river which divides it&s;elf into many &s;treams, whereof one is greater than the re&s;t. The corruption of nature is the river-head, which has many particular lu&s;ts, in which it runs: but it mainly di&s;burdens it&s;elf into what is commonly called one's predo|minate &s;in. Now all of the&s;e being fed by the &s;in of our nature; it is evident that &s;in is the great reigning &s;in, which never lo&s;eth its &s;uperiority over particular lu&s;ts, that live and die with it, and by it. But as in &s;ome rivers, the main &s;tream runs not always in one and the &s;ame channel: &s;o particular predominants may be changed, as lu&s;ts in youth may be &s;ucceeded by covetou&s;ne&s;s in old age. Now, what doth it avail to reform in other &s;ins, while the great reigning &s;in remains in its full power? What tho' &s;ome particular lu&s;t be broken? If that &s;in, the &s;in of our nature keep the throne, it will &s;et up another in its &s;tead: as when a water-cour&s;e is &s;topt in one place, while the fountain is not dammed up, it will &s;tream forth another way. And thus &s;ome ca&s;t off their prodigality, but covetou&s;ne&s;s comes up in its &s;tead: &s;ome ca&s;t away their profanity, and the corruption of nature &s;ends not its main &s;tream that way as before: but it rans in another channel, namely, in that of a <HI>legal di&s;po&s;ition, &s;elf-righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> or the like, &s;o
<PB N="93" REF="045042_0090_101F4439B26B8438">
that people are ruined by their not eying the &s;in of their nature.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> It is an hereditary evil, P&s;al. li. 5. <HI>In &s;in did my mother conceive me.</HI> Particular lu&s;ts are not &s;o, but in the virtue of their cau&s;e. A prodigal father may have a frugal &s;on: but this di&s;ea&s;e is nece&s;&s;arily propagated in nature, and therefore harde&s;t to cure. Surely then the word &s;hould be given out again&s;t this &s;in, as again&s;t the King of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> 1 Kings xxii. 31. <HI>Fight neither with &s;mall nor great, &s;ave only with this:</HI> for this &s;in being broke, all other &s;ins are broken with it; and while it &s;tands entire, there is no victory.</P>
<P N="4">IV. That ye may get a view of the corruption of your nature, I would recommend to you three things (1.) Study to know the &s;pirituality and extent of the law of God, for that is the gla&s;s wherein you may &s;ee your&s;elves (2.) Ob&s;erve your hearts at all times, but e&s;pecially under temptation. Temptation is a fire that brings up the &s;cum of the vile heart: do ye carefully mark the fir&s;t ri&s;ings of cor|ruption. <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> Go to God through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for illumination by his Spirit. Lay out your &s;oul before the Lord, as willing to know the vilene&s;s of your nature: &s;ay unto him, <HI>That which I know not, teach thou m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">:</HI> and be willing to take in light from the word. Believe, and you &s;hall &s;ee. It is by the word the Spirit teacheth, but, without the Spirit's teaching, all other teaching will be to little purpo&s;e. Tho' the go&s;pel &s;hould &s;hine about you, like the &s;un at noon-day; and this great truth be never &s;o plainly preached: you will never &s;ee your&s;elves aright, until the Spirit of the Lord light his candle within your brea&s;t: the fulne&s;s and glory of Chri&s;t, the corruption and vilene&s;s of our nature, are never rightly learned, but where the Spirit of Chri&s;t is the teacher.</P>
<P>And now to &s;hut up this weighty point, let the con&s;ideration of what is &s;aid, commend Chri&s;t to you all. Ye that are brought out of your natural &s;tate of corruption unto Chri&s;t, be humble; &s;till coming to Chri&s;t, and improving your union with him, to the further weak|ning of the remains of this natural corruption. Is your nature changed? It is but in part &s;o. The day was, ye could not &s;tir; now ye are cured: but remember the cure is not yet perfected, ye &s;till go halting. And tho' it were better with you than it is; the remembrance of what you were by nature, &s;hould keep you low. Ye that are yet in your natural &s;tate, take with it: believe the corruption of your nature: and let Chri&s;t and his grace be precious in your eyes. O that ye would at length be &s;erious about the &s;tate of your &s;ouls! What mind ye to do? Ye mu&s;t die; ye mu&s;t appear before the judgment &s;eat of God. Will ye ly down, and &s;leep another night at ea&s;e, in this ca&s;e? Do it not: for before another day you may be &s;i&s;ted before God's dreadful tri|bunal, in the grave cloaths of your corrupt &s;tate; and your vile &s;ouls ca&s;t into the pit of de&s;truction, as a corrupt lump, to be for ever buried out of God's &s;ight. For I te&s;tify unto you all, there is no peace with God, no pardon, no heaven for you, in this &s;tate: there is but a &s;tep betwixt you and eternal de&s;truction from the pre&s;ence of the Lord:
<PB N="94" REF="045042_0091_101F7DA2424ED200">
if the brittle thread of your life, which may be broke with a touch, ere you are aware, be indeed broken while you are in this &s;tate; you are ruined for ever, and without remedy.

<P>We&mdash;were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>HAVING &s;hewed you the &s;infulne&s;s of man's natural &s;tate, I come now to lay before you the mi&s;ery of it. A &s;inful &s;tate cannot be but a mi&s;erable &s;tate. If &s;in go before, wrath follows of cour&s;e. Corruption and de&s;truction are &s;o knit together, that the Holy Gho&s;t calls de&s;truction, even eternal de&s;truction, <HI>corruption,</HI> Gal. vi. 8. <HI>He that &s;oweth to his fle&s;h,&s;hall of the fle&s;h reap corruption,</HI> that is, everla&s;ting de&s;truction; as is clear from its being oppo&s;ed to life everla&s;ting, in the following clau&s;e. And &s;o the Apo&s;tle having &s;hown the <HI>Ephe&s;ians</HI> their real &s;tate by nature, <HI>to wit,</HI> that they were dead in &s;ins and tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, altogether corrupt; he tells them in the words of the text, their relative &s;tate, namely, that the pit was digged for them, while in that &s;tate of corruption: being dead in &s;ins, they were by nature children of wrath, even as others.</P>
<P>In the words we have four things,</P>
<P N="1">1. The mi&s;ery of a natural &s;tate; it is a &s;tate of wrath, as well as a &s;tate of &s;in. <HI>We were,</HI> &s;ays the Apo&s;tle, <HI>children of wrath,</HI> bound over, and liable to the wrath of God; under wrath in &s;ome mea&s;ure; and, in wrath, bound over to more, even the full mea&s;ure of it in hell, where the floods of it go over the pri&s;oners for ever. Thus <HI>Saul,</HI> in his wrath, adjudging <HI>David</HI> to die, (1 Sam. xx. 31.) and <HI>David,</HI> in his wrath, pa&s;&s;ing &s;entence of death again&s;t the man in the parable, (2 Sam. xii. 5.) &s;ay each of them, of his &s;uppo&s;ed criminal, <HI>He &s;hall &s;urely die:</HI> or, as the words in the fir&s;t language are, <HI>he is a &s;on of death.</HI> So the natural man is a child of wrath, a &s;on of death. He is a malefactor dead in law, lying in chains of guilt: a criminal held fa&s;t in his &s;etters, till the day of execution: which will not fail, unle&s;s a pardon be obtained from his God, who is his judge and party too. By that means, indeed, children of wrath may become children of the kingdom. The phra&s;e in the text, however common it is in holy
<PB N="95" REF="045042_0092_101F7DA5A8435B98">
language, is very &s;ignificant. And as it is evident, that the Apo&s;tle calling natural men, <HI>the children of di&s;obedience,</HI> (ver. 2) means more, than that they were di&s;obedient children; for &s;uch may the Lord's own children be: &s;o to be children of wrath, is more than &s;imply to be liable to, or under wrath. Je&s;us Chri&s;t was liable to, and under wrath: but I doubt we have any warrant to &s;ay, he was a child of wrath. The phra&s;e &s;eems to intimate, that men are, what&s;oever they are in their natural &s;tate, under the wrath of God; that they are wholly under wrath: wrath is, as it were, woven into their very nature, and mixeth it&s;elf with the whole of the man; who is (if I may &s;o &s;peak) a very lump of wrath, a child of hell, as the iron in the fire is all fire, For men naturally are children of wrath, come forth, &s;o to &s;peak, out of the womb of wrath; <HI>Jonah</HI>'s gourd was the &s;on of a night, (which we render <HI>came up in a night,</HI> Jonah iv. 10.) as if it had come out of the womb of the night; (as we read of the womb of the morning, P&s;al. cx. 3.) and &s;o, the birth following the belly whence it came, was &s;oon gone. The &s;parks of fire are called &s;ons of the burning coal, Job v. 7. marg. I&s;a. xxi. 10. <HI>O my thre&s;hing, and the corn</HI> (or <HI>&s;on) of my floor,</HI> thre&s;hen in the floor of wrath, and, as it were brought forth by it. Thus the natural man is a child of wrath: <HI>it comes into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones,</HI> P&s;al. cix. 18. For, tho' <HI>Judas</HI> was the only &s;on of perdition among&s;t the Apo&s;tles; yet all men, by nature, are of the &s;ame family.</P>
<P N="2">2. There is the ri&s;e of this mi&s;ery: men have it by nature. They owe it to their nature: not to their &s;ub&s;tance or offence: for that neither is nor was &s;in, and therefore cannot make them children of wrath; tho' for &s;in it may be under wrath: not to their nature as qualified, at man's creation, by his Maker: but to their nature as vitiated and corrupted by the fall. To the vicious quality, or cor|ruption of their nature, (whereof before) which is their principle of action, and cea&s;ing from action, the only principle is an unregenerate &s;tate. Now by this nature, men are children of wrath; as in time of pe&s;tilential infection, one draws in death together with the di&s;ea&s;e then raging. Wherefore &s;eeing from our fir&s;t being, as children of <HI>Adam,</HI> we be corrupt children, &s;hapen in iniquity, conceived in &s;in; we are al&s;o, from that moment, children of wrath.</P>
<P N="3">3. The univer&s;ity of this mi&s;ery. All are by nature children of wrath; <HI>We,</HI> &s;aith the Apo&s;tle, <HI>even as others; Jews</HI> as well as <HI>Gentiles.</HI> Tho&s;e that are now, by grace, the children of God, were, by nature, in no better ca&s;e, than tho&s;e that are &s;till in their natural &s;tate.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> There is a glorious and happy change intimated here; we were children of wrath, but are not &s;o now; grace has brought us out of that fearful &s;tate. This the Apo&s;tle &s;ays of him&s;elf and other believers. And thus, it well becomes the people of God to be often &s;tanding on the &s;hore looking back to the red-&s;ea of the &s;tate of wrath, they were &s;ometimes weltering in, even as others.</P>

<HEAD>Man's natural State, a State of Wrath.</HEAD>
<P>DOCTRINE, <HI>The &s;tate of nature is a &s;tate of wrath.</HI> Every one in a natural unregenerate &s;tate, is in a &s;tate of wrath. We are born <HI>children of wrath;</HI> and continue &s;o, until we be born again. Nay, as &s;oon as we were children of <HI>Adam,</HI> we were children of wrath.</P>
<P>I &s;hall u&s;her in what I am to &s;ay on this point, with a few ob&s;erves touching the univer&s;ality of this <HI>&s;tate of wrath;</HI> which may &s;erve to prepare the way of the word into your con&s;ciences.</P>
<P>Wrath has gone as wide as ever &s;in went. When angels &s;inned, the wrath of God brake in upon them as a flood; <HI>God &s;pared not the angels that &s;inned, but ca&s;t them down to hell,</HI> 2 Pet. ii. 4. And thereby it was demon&s;trated, that no natural excellency in the creature will &s;hield it from the wrath of God; if once it becomes a &s;inful creature. The fine&s;t and the nice&s;t piece of the workman&s;hip of heaven, if once the Creator's image upon it be defaced by &s;in, God can and will da&s;h it in pieces, in his wrath; unle&s;s &s;atisfaction be made to ju&s;tice, and that image be repaired; neither of which the &s;inner him&s;elf can do. <HI>Adam</HI> &s;inned; and the whole lump of mankind was leavened, and bound over to the fiery oven of God's wrath. And from the text ye may learn, (1.) That ignorance of that &s;tate cannot free men from it; the <HI>Gentiles</HI> that knew not God, <HI>were by nature children of wrath, even as others.</HI> A man's hou&s;e may be on fire, his wife and children peri&s;hing in the flames; while he knows nothing of it, and therefore is not concerned about it. Such is your ca&s;e, O ye that are ignorant of the&s;e things! wrath is &s;ilently &s;inking into your &s;ouls, while you are ble&s;&s;ing your&s;elves, &s;aying, <HI>Ye &s;hall have peace.</HI> Ye need not a more certain token, that ye are <HI>children of wrath,</HI> than that ye never yet &s;aw your&s;elves &s;uch. Ye cannot be the children of God, that never yet &s;aw your&s;elves children of the devil. Ye cannot be in the way to heaven, that never &s;aw your&s;elves by nature in the high road to hell. Ye are gro&s;ly ignorant of your &s;tate by nature; and &s;o ignorant of God, and of Chri&s;t, and your need of him: and tho' ye look on your ignorance as a covert from wrath; yet take it out of the mouth of God him&s;elf, that it will ruin you if it be not removed, I&s;a. xxvii. 11. <HI>It is a people of no under&s;tanding: therefore he that made them will not have mercy on them.</HI> See 2 The&s;&s;. i. 8. Ho&s;. iv. 6. (2.) No outward privileges can exempt men from this &s;tate of wrath; for the <HI>Jews,</HI> the children of the kingdom, God's peculiar people, were <HI>children of wrath even as others.</HI> Tho' ye be church-members, partakers of all church privileges; tho' you be de&s;cended of godly parents, of great and honourable families; be what ye will, ye are by nature, heirs of hell, <HI>children of wrath.</HI> (3.) No profe&s;&s;ion, nor attainments in a profe&s;&s;ion of religion, do or can exempt a man from this &s;tate of wrath. <HI>Paul</HI> was one of the &s;traite&s;t &s;ect of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> religion, Acts xxvi. 5, yet a <HI>child of wrath, even as others,</HI> till he was
<PB N="97" REF="045042_0094_101F7DA93431CD18">
converted. The clo&s;e hypocrite, and the profane, are alike as to their &s;tate; however different their conver&s;ations be: and they will be alike in their fatal end, P&s;al. cxxv. 5. <HI>As for &s;uch as turn a&s;ide unto their crooked ways, the Lord &s;hall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity.</HI> (4.) Young ones that are yet but &s;etting out into the world, have not that to do, to make them&s;elves <HI>children of wrath,</HI> by follow|ing the gracele&s;s multitude. They are <HI>children of wrath by nature:</HI> &s;o it is done already: they were born heirs of hell; they will indeed make them&s;elves more &s;o, if they do not, while they are young, flee from the wrath they were born to, by fleeing to Je&s;us Chri&s;t.&mdash; <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> Whatever men are now by grace, they were even as others, by nature. And this may be a &s;ad meditation to them, that have been at ea&s;e from their youth, and have had no changes.</P>
<P>Now, the&s;e things being premi&s;ed, I &s;hall, in the fir&s;t place, &s;hew what this &s;tate of wrath is; next, confirm the doctrine; and then apply it.</P>
<P N="1">I. I am to &s;hew what this &s;tate of wrath is. But who can fully de&s;cribe the wrath of an angry God? None can do it. Yet &s;o much of it mu&s;t be di&s;covered, as may &s;erve to convince men of the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of fleeing to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, out of that <HI>&s;tate of wrath.</HI> Anger in men is a pa&s;&s;ion, and commotion of the &s;pirit for an injury received, with a de&s;ire to re&s;ent the &s;ame. When it comes to a height, and is fixed in one's &s;pirit, it is called wrath. Now there are no pa&s;&s;ions in God, properly &s;peaking: they are incon&s;i&s;tent with his ab&s;olute uuchangeablene&s;s, and independency; and therefore <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> (to remove the mi&s;take of the <HI>Lycaonians,</HI> who thought they were gods) tell them, they were <HI>men of like pa&s;&s;ions</HI> with them&s;elves, Acts xiv. 15. Wrath then is attributed to God, not in re&s;pect of the affection of wrath, but the effects thereof. Wrath is a fire in the bowels of a man, tormenting the man him&s;elf: but there is no per|turbation in God. His wrath does not in the lea&s;t mar that infinite rep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e and happine&s;s, which he hath in him&s;elf. It is a mo&s;t pure undi&s;turbed act of his will producing dreadful effects again&s;t the &s;inner. It is little we know of an infinite God: but conde&s;cending to our weak|ne&s;s, he is plea&s;ed to &s;peak of him&s;elf to us, after the manner of men. Let us therefore notice man's wrath, but remove every thing in our con&s;ideration of the wrath of God, that argues imperfection: and &s;o we may attain to &s;ome view of it, however &s;canty. By this means we are led to take up the wrath of God again&s;t the natural man in the&s;e three.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> There is wrath in the heart of God again&s;t him. The Lord approves him not, but is di&s;plea&s;ed with him. Every natural man lies under the di&s;plea&s;ure of God; and that is heavier than mountains of bra&s;s, Altho' he be plea&s;ed with him&s;elf, and others be plea&s;ed with him too; yet God looks down on him, as di&s;plea&s;ed. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> His per&s;on is under God's di&s;plea&s;ure: <HI>Thou hate&s;t all workers of iniquity,</HI> P&s;al. v. 5. A godly man's &s;in is di&s;plea&s;ing to God, yet his per&s;on is
<PB N="98" REF="045042_0095_101F7DADC921CC90">
&s;till <HI>accepted in the Beloved,</HI> Eph. i. 6, But <HI>God is angry with the wicked every day,</HI> P&s;al. vii. 11. There is a fire of wrath burns con|tinually again&s;t him, in the heart of God. They are as dogs and &s;wine, mo&s;t abominable creatures in the &s;ight of God. Tho' their natural &s;tate be gilded over with a &s;hining profe&s;&s;ion, yet they are abhorred of God: they are to him as <HI>&s;moke in his no&s;e,</HI> I&s;a. lxv. 5. and lukewarm water, to be <HI>&s;pewed out of his mouth,</HI> Rev, iii. 16. <HI>whited &s;epulchres,</HI> Matth. xxiii. 27. <HI>a generation of vipers,</HI> Matth. xii. 34. and a <HI>people of his wrath,</HI> I&s;a. x. 6.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> He is di&s;plea&s;ed with all they do: It is impo&s;&s;ible for them to plea&s;e him, being unbelievers, Heb. xi. 6. He hates their per&s;ons: and &s;o hath no plea&s;ure in, but is di&s;plea&s;ed with their be&s;t works, I&s;a lvi. 3. <HI>He that &s;acrificeth a lamb, as if he cut off a dog's neck,</HI> &amp;c. Their duty, as done by them, is <HI>an abomination to the Lord,</HI> Prov xv. 8. And as men turn their back upon them whom they are angry with; &s;o the Lord's refu&s;ing communion with the natural man in his duties, is a plain indication of this wrath.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> There is wrath in the word of God again&s;t him. When wrath is in the heart, it &s;eeks a vent by the lips: &s;o God fights again&s;t the natural man with <HI>the &s;word of his mouth,</HI> Rev ii. 16. The Lord's word never &s;peaks good of him, but always cur&s;eth or condemneth him. Hence it is, that when he is awakened, the word read or preached often increa&s;eth his horror. <HI>Firs;t,</HI> It condemns all his actions, together with his corrupt nature. There is nothing he does, but the law declares it to be &s;in. It is a rule of perfect obedience, from which he always in all things, declines; and &s;o it rejects every thing he doth as &s;in. <HI>Secondly,</HI> It pronounceth his doom, and de|nounceth God's cur&s;e again&s;t him, Gal. iii. 10. <HI>For as many as are of the works of the law, are under the cur&s;e: for it is written, Cur&s;ed is every one that continueth not in all things, which are written in the book of law, to do them.</HI> Be he never &s;o well in the world, it pronoun|ceth a woe from heaven again&s;t him, I&s;a.iii. 11. The Bible is a quiver filled with arrows of wrath again&s;t him, ready to be poured in on his &s;oul. God's threatnings in his word, hang over his head as a black cloud, ready to &s;hower down on him every moment. The word is indeed the &s;aint's &s;ecurity again&s;t wrath, but it binds the natural man's &s;in and wrath together, as a certain pledge of his ruin, if he continue in that &s;tate. So the con&s;cience being awakened, and per|ceiving this tie made by the law, the man is filled with terrors in his &s;oul.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> There is wrath in the hand of God again&s;t the natural man. He is under heavy &s;trokes of wrath already, and is liable to more.</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>&s;t,</HI> There is wrath on his body. It is a piece of cur&s;ed day, which wrath is &s;inking into by virtue of the threatning of the fir&s;t covenant, Gen. ii. 17. <HI>In the day that thou eate&s;t thereof, thou &s;halt &s;urely die.</HI> There is never a di&s;ea&s;e, gripe nor &s;titch, that affects him, but it comes on him with the &s;ting of God's indignation in it. They are all cords of death, &s;ent before to bind the pri&s;oner.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="99" REF="045042_0096_101F7DB0D04976D0">2<HI>dly,</HI> There is wrath upon his &s;oul. (1.) He can have no com|munion with God; he is <HI>fooli&s;h, and &s;hall not &s;tand in God's &s;ight,</HI> P&s;al v. 5. When <HI>Adam</HI> &s;inned, God turned him out of paradi&s;e: and natural men are, as <HI>Adam</HI> left them, bani&s;hed from the gracious pre&s;ence of the Lord; and can have no acce&s;s to him in that &s;tate. There is war betwixt heaven and them: and &s;o all commerce is cut off. <HI>They are without God in the world,</HI> Eph. ii. 12. The &s;un is gone down on them, and there is not the lea&s;t glimp&s;e of favour towards them from heaven. (2) Hence the &s;oul is left to pine away in its iniquity. The natural darkne&s;s of their minds, the aver&s;ene&s;s to good in their wills, the di&s;order of their a&s;&s;ertions, and di&s;temper of their con&s;ciences, and all their natural plagues, we left upon them in a penal way; and being &s;o left, increa&s;e daily. God ca&s;ts a portion of worldly goods to them, more or le&s;s; as a bone is thrown to a dog: but alas! his wrath again&s;t them appears, in that they get no grace. The Phy&s;ician of &s;ouls comes by them, and goes by them, and cures others be&s;ide them; while they are con&s;uming away in their iniquity, and ripning daily for utter de&s;truction. (3.) They ly open to fearful additional plagues on their &s;ouls, even in this life. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Sometimes they meet with deadning &s;trokes; &s;ilent blows from the hand of an angry God; arrows of wrath that enter into their &s;ouls without noi&s;e, I&s;a. vi. 10. <HI>Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and &s;hut their eyes, le&s;t they &s;ee with their eyes,</HI> &amp;c. God &s;trives with them for a while, and convictions enter their con&s;ciences; but they rebel again&s;t the light: and by a &s;ecret judgment, they are knocked on the head; &s;o that, from that time, they do as it were, live and rot above ground. Their hearts are deadned; their affections withered; their con&s;ciences &s;tupified; and their whole &s;ouls bla&s;ted; <HI>ca&s;t forth as a branch, and withered,</HI> John xv. 16. They are plagued with judicial blindne&s;s. They &s;hut their eyes again&s;t the light, and they are given over to the devil, the god of this world, to be blinded more, 2 Cor. iv. 4. Yea, <HI>God &s;ends them &s;trong delu&s;ions, that they &s;hould believe a lie,</HI> 2 The&s;&s;. ii. 11. <HI>even con&s;cience,</HI> like a &s;elf light on the &s;hore leads them upon rocks; by which they are broken in pieces. They harden them&s;elves again&s;t God; and he gives up with them, and leaves them to Satan and their own hearts, whereby they are hardned more and more. They are often given up unto <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e affections, Rom. i. 26. The reins are laid on their necks; and they are left to run into all exce&s;s, as their furious lu&s;ts draw them. <HI>Secondly,</HI> Sometimes they meet with quickning &s;trokes, whereby their &s;ouls become <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> mount <HI>Sinai;</HI> where nothing is &s;een, but fire and &s;moak: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> heard, but the thunder of God's wrath, and the voice of the trumpet of a broken law, waxing louder and louder&punc; which makes them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Pa&s;tner,</HI> (Jer. xx. 4.) <HI>A terror to them&s;elves.</HI> God takes the filthy garments of their &s;ins, which they were wont to &s;leep in &s;ecurely; overlays them with brim&s;tone, and &s;ets them on fire about their ears: &s;o they have a hell within them.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="100" REF="045042_0097_101F7EF82C2E2670">3<HI>dly,</HI> There is wrath on the natural man's enjoyments. What|ever be wanting in his hou&s;e, there is one thing that is never wanting there, Prov. iii. 33. <HI>The cur&s;e of the Lord is in the hou&s;e of the wicked.</HI> Wrath is on all that he has; on the bread that he eats, the liquor he drinks, and clothes which he wears. <HI>His ba&s;ket and &s;tore are cur&s;ed,</HI> Deut. xxviii. 17. Some things fall wrong with him; and that comes to pa&s;s by virtue of his wrath; other things go according to his wi&s;h, and there is wrath in that too; for it is a &s;nare to his &s;oul, Prov. i 32. <HI>The pro&s;perity of fools &s;hall de&s;troy them.</HI> This wrath turns his ble&s;&s;|ings into cur&s;es, Mal ii. 2. <HI>I will cur&s;e your ble&s;&s;ings: yea, I have cur&s;ed them already.</HI> The holy law is a killing letter to him, 2 Cor. iii. 6. The mini&s;try of the go&s;pel, <HI>a &s;avour of death unto death,</HI> chap. ii. 15. In the &s;acrament of the Lord's &s;upper, <HI>he eateth and drinketh damnation to him&s;elf,</HI> 1 Cor xi. 29. Nay, more than all that, Chri&s;t him&s;elf is to him, <HI>a &s;tone of &s;tumbling, and a rock of offence,</HI> 1 Pet. ii. 8. Thus wrath follows the natural man, as his &s;hadow doth his body.</P>
<P N="4">4<HI>thly,</HI> He is under the power of Satan, Acts xxvi. 18. The devil has overcome him, &s;o he is his by conque&s;t; his lawful captive, I&s;a. xlix. 24. The natural man is condemned already, John iii. 18. and therefore under the heavy hand of <HI>him that hath the power of death, that is the devil.</HI> And he keeps his pri&s;oner, in the pri&s;on of a natural &s;tate, bound hand and foot, I&s;a. lxi 1. <HI>Laden with divers lu&s;ts,</HI> as chains wherewith he holds them fa&s;t. Thou neede&s;t not, as many do, call on the devil to take thee; for he has a fa&s;t hold of thee already, as a child of wrath.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> The natural man has no &s;ecurity for a moment's &s;afety from the wrath of God its coming on him to the uttermo&s;t. The cur&s;e of the law denounced again&s;t him, has already tied him to the &s;take: &s;o that the arrows of ju&s;tice may pierce his &s;oul; and in him may meet all the mi&s;eries and plagues that flow from the avenging wrath of God. See how he is &s;et as a mark to the arrows of wrath, P&s;al. vii. 11, 12, 13. <HI>God is angry with the wicked every day. If he turn not, he will whet his &s;word: he hath bent his bow, and made it ready; he hath al&s;o prepared for him the in&s;truments of death.</HI> Doth he ly down to &s;leep? There is not a promi&s;e, he knows of, or can know, to &s;ecure him that he &s;hall not be in hell ere he awake. Ju&s;tice is pur&s;uing, and cries for vengeance on the &s;inner: the law ca&s;ts the fire balls of its cur&s;es continually upon him: wa&s;ted and long tired pati|ence is that which keeps in his life: he walks amid&s;t enemies armed again&s;t him: his name may be <HI>Magor Mi&s;&s;abib,</HI> i. e. <HI>terror round about,</HI> Jer. xx. 3. Angels, devils, men, bea&s;ts, &s;tones, heaven, and earth, are in readine&s;s, on a word of command <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rom the Lord, to ruin him.</P>
<P>Thus the natural man lives, but he mu&s;t die too; and death is a dreadful me&s;&s;enger to him It comes upon him armed with wrath, and puts three &s;ad charges in his hand (1) Death chargeth him to bid an eternal farewell to all things in this world; to leave it, and make away to another world. Ah! what a dredful charge mu&s;t this
<PB N="101" REF="045042_0098_101F7DB79E3BBF00">
be to a child of wrath! He can have no comfort from heaven; for God is his enemy: and as for the things of the world, and the enjoy|ment of his lu&s;ts, which were the only &s;prings of his comfort; the&s;e are in a moment dried up to him for ever. He is not ready for another world: he was not thinking of removing &s;o &s;oon: or if he was, yet he has no portion &s;ecured to him in another world, but that which he was born to, and was increa&s;ing all his days, namely, <HI>a trea&s;ure of wrath.</HI> But go he mu&s;t; his clay god, the world, mu&s;t be parted with, and <HI>what has he more?</HI> There was never a glimmering of light, or favour from heaven, to his &s;oul: and now the wrath that did hang in the threatning as <HI>a cloud like a man's hand,</HI> is darkning the face of the whole heaven above him: and if he <HI>look unto the earth,</HI> (from whence all his light was wont to come) <HI>behold trouble and darkne&s;s, dirtne&s;s of angui&s;h; and he &s;hall be driven to darkne&s;s,</HI> I&s;a. viii 22. (2) Death chargeth &s;oul and body to part till the great day&punc; His &s;oul is required of him, Luke xii 20. O what a mi&s;erable parting mu&s;t this be to a child of wrath! care was indeed taken to provide for the body things nece&s;&s;ary for this life&punc; but alas! there is nothing laid up for another life to it; nothing to be a &s;eed of glorious re&s;ur|rection: as it lived, &s;o it mu&s;t die, and ri&s;e again &s;inful fle&s;h; fuel for the fire of God's wrath. As for the &s;oul, he was never &s;olicitous to provide for it. It lay in the body, dead to God&punc; and all things truly good; and &s;o mu&s;t be carried out into the pit, in the grave cloths of its natural &s;tate: for now that death comes, the companions in &s;in mu&s;t part. (3.) Death chargeth the &s;oul to compear before the tribunal of God, while the body lies to be carried to the grave, Eccle&s;. xii. 7. <HI>The &s;pirit &s;hall return unto God who gave it.</HI> Heb. ix 2, 7. <HI>It is ap|pointed unto all men once to die, but after this the judgment.</HI> Well were it for the &s;inful &s;oul if it might be buried together with the body. But that cannot be: it mu&s;t go and receive its &s;entence; and &s;hall be &s;hut up in the pri&s;on of hell, while the cur&s;ed body lies impri&s;oned in the grave, till the day of the general judgment.</P>
<P>When the end of the world, appointed of God, is come; the trumpet &s;hall &s;ound, and the dead ari&s;e. Then &s;hall the weary earth, at the command of the Judge, ca&s;t forth the bodies; the cur&s;ed bodies of the&s;e that lived and died in their natural &s;tate: <HI>The &s;ea, death, and hell, &s;hall deliver up their dead,</HI> Rev. xx. 13.

They &s;hall be eternally &s;hut up in hell, never to get the lea&s;t drop of comfort, nor the lea&s;t ea&s;e of their torment.

God &s;hall, thro' all eternity, hold them up with the one hand, and pour the full vials of wrath into them with the other.</P>
<P>This is that &s;tate of wrath natural men live in; being under much of the wrath of God, and liable to more. But for a further view of it, let us con&s;ider the qualities of that wrath (1.) It is irre&s;i&s;tible, there is no &s;tanding before it. <HI>Who may &s;tand in thy &s;ight, when once thou art angry?</HI> P&s;al. lxxxvi. 7. Can the worm, or the moth, defend it&s;elf again&s;t him that de&s;igns to cru&s;h it? As little can worm man &s;tand before an angry God Fooli&s;h man indeed practically bids a defiance to heaven: but the Lord often, even in this world, opens &s;uch &s;luices of wrath upon them, as all their might cannot &s;top; but they are carried away thereby, as with a flood. How much more will it be &s;o in hell? (2.) It is un&s;upportable. What one cannot re&s;i&s;t, he will &s;et him&s;elf to bear: but, <HI>Who &s;hall dwell with devouring fire? Who &s;hall dwell with everla&s;ting burnings?</HI> God's wrath is a weight that will &s;ink men into the lowe&s;t hell. It is a burden no man is able to &s;tand under. <HI>A wounded &s;pirit who can bear it?</HI> Prov. xviii. 14. (3.) It is unavoidable to &s;uch as will go on impenitently in their &s;in|ful cour&s;e. <HI>He that being often reproved, hardneth his neck, &s;hall &s;ud|denly be de&s;troyed, and that without remedy,</HI> Prov. xxix 1. We may now fly from it indeed, by flying to Je&s;us Chri&s;t: but &s;uch as fly from Chri&s;t, &s;hall never be able to avoid it. Whither can men fly from an avenging God? Where will they find a &s;helter? The hills will not hear them; the mountains will be deaf to their loude&s;t cries; when they cry to them, to <HI>hide them from the wrath of the Lamb.</HI> (4.) It is <HI>powerful and fierce wrath,</HI> P&s;al. xc. 11. <HI>Who knoweth the power of thine anger? Even according to thy fean, &s;o is thy wrath.</HI> We are apt to fear the wrath of man more than we ought: but no man can appre|hend the wrath of God to be more dreadful than it really is: the power of it can never be known to the utmo&s;t; &s;eeing it is infinite, and (properly &s;peaking) has no utmo&s;t: how fierce &s;oever it be, either on earth, or in hell, God can &s;till carry it further. Every thing in God is mo&s;t perfect in its kind; and therefore no wrath is &s;o fierce as his. O &s;inner, how wilt thou be able to endure that wrath, which will <HI>tear thee in pieces,</HI> P&s;al. l. 22. and <HI>grind thee to powder,</HI> Luke xx 18. The hi&s;tory of the two &s;he bears, that tare the children of <HI>Bethel,</HI> is an awful on, 2 Kings ii. 23, 24. But the united force of the rage of lions, leopards, and &s;he bears bereaved of their whelps, is not &s;ufficient to give us even a &s;canty view of the power of the wrath of God, Ho&s;. xiii. 7, 8. <HI>Therefore I will be unto them as a lion; as a leopard by the way will I ob&s;erve them. I will meet them as a bear that is bereaved of her whelps, and will rent the caul of their heart,</HI> &amp;c. (5) It is penetrating and piercing wrath. It is burning wrath, and

firey indignation. There is no pain more exqui&s;ite, than that which is cau&s;ed by fire; and no fire &s;o piercing as the fire of God's indigna|tion, that <HI>burns into the lowe&s;t hell,</HI> Deut. xxxii. 22. The arrows of men's wrath can pierce fle&s;h, blood and bones: but cannot reach the &s;oul: but the wrath of God will &s;ink into the &s;oul, and &s;o pierce a man in the mo&s;t tender part. Like as, when a per&s;on is thunder-&s;truck, oft-times there is not a wound to be &s;een in the &s;kin; yet life is gone, and the bones are, as it were, melted: &s;o God's wrath can penetrate into, and melt one's &s;oul within him, when his earthly comforts &s;tand about him entire, and untouched as in <HI>Bel&s;hazzar</HI>'s ca&s;e, Dan. v. 6. (6.) It is con&s;tant wrath, running parallel with the man's continuance in an unregenerate &s;tate; con&s;tantly attending him, from the womb to the grave. There are few &s;o dark days, but the &s;un &s;ometimes looketh out from under the clouds: but the wrath of God, is an abiding cloud on the &s;ubjects of it, John iii 36. <HI>The wrath of God abideth on him</HI> that believes not. (7.) It is eternal. O mi&s;er|able &s;oul! If thou fly not from this wrath unto Je&s;us Chri&s;t, thy mi&s;ery had a beginning, but it &s;hall never have an end. Should devouring death wholly &s;wallow thee up, and for ever hold thee fa&s;t in a grave; it would be kind, but thou mu&s;t live again, and never die; that thou may&s;t be ever dying, <HI>in the hands of the living God.</HI> Cold death will quench the flame of man's wrath again&s;t us, if nothing el&s;e do it: but God's wrath, when it has come on the &s;inner, millions of ages will &s;till be <HI>the wrath to come,</HI> Matth. iii. 7. 1 The&s;&s;. i. 10. As the water of a river is &s;till coming, how much &s;oever of it has pa&s;&s;ed. While God is, he will pur&s;ue the quarrel. <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> How&s;oever dreadful it is, and tho' it be eternal, yet it is mo&s;t ju&s;t wrath: it is a clear fire, without the lea&s;t &s;moak of unju&s;tice. The &s;ea of wrath raging with greate&s;t fury again&s;t the &s;inner, is clear as chry&s;tal. The Judge of all the earth can do no wrong. He knows no tran&s;ports of pa&s;&s;ion, for they are incon&s;i&s;tent with the perfection of his nature. <HI>Is God un|righteous, who taketh vengeance?

<HEAD>The Doctrine of the State of Wrath confirmed and vindicated.</HEAD>
<P N="2">II. I &s;hall confirm the doctrine. Con&s;ider, (1.) How peremptory the threatning of the fir&s;t covenant is; <HI>In the day thou eate&s;t thereof, thou &s;halt &s;urely die,</HI> Gen. ii. 17. Hereby &s;in and puni&s;hment being connected, the veracity of God a&s;certains the execution of the threat|ning.

iniquity,</HI> P&s;al. v. 6. (3.) The horrors of a natural con&s;cience prove this. There is a con&s;cience in the brea&s;ts of men, which can tell them, they are &s;inners; and therefore liable to the wrath of God. Let men, at any time, &s;oberly commune with them&s;elves, and they will find they have the witne&s;s in them&s;elves, <HI>knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit &s;uch things, are worthy of death,</HI> Rom. i. 32. (4) The pangs of the new birth, the work of the &s;pirit of bondage on elect &s;ouls, in order to their conver&s;ion, demon&s;trate this. Hereby their natural &s;infulne&s;s and mi&s;ery, as liable to the wrath of God, are plainly taught them, filling their hearts with fear of that wrath. Now that this &s;pirit of bondage is no other than the Spirit of God, who&s;e work is to convince of &s;in, righteou&s;ne&s;s, and judg|ment, (John xvi. 8.) this te&s;timony mu&s;t needs be true; for the Spirit of truth cannot witne&s;s an untruth. Mean while, true be|lievers being freed from the &s;tate of wrath, <HI>receive not the &s;pirit of bondage again to fear, but receive the Spirit of adoption,</HI> Rom. iii. 15. And therefore, if fears of that nature do ari&s;e, after the &s;oul's union with Chri&s;t: they come from the &s;aint's own &s;pirit, or from a wor&s;e. <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> The &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t plainly prove this doctrine. Where|fore was the Son of God, a Son under wrath, but becau&s;e the child|ren of men were children of wrath? He &s;uffered the wrath of God, not for him&s;elf, but for tho&s;e that were liable to it in their own per&s;ons. Nay, this not only &s;peaks us to have been liable to wrath; but al&s;o that wrath mu&s;t have a vent, in the puni&s;hing of &s;in. If this was done in the green tree, what will become of the dry? What a mi&s;erable ca&s;e mu&s;t a &s;inner be in that is out of Chri&s;t; that is not vitally united to Chri&s;t, and partakes not of his Spirit? God, who &s;pared not his own Son, &s;urely will not &s;pare &s;uch an one.</P>
<P>But the unregenerate man, who has no great value for the honour of God, will be apt to ri&s;e up again&s;t his Judge, and in his own heart condemn his procedure. Neverthele&s;s the Judge being infinitely ju&s;t, the &s;entence mu&s;t be righteous. And therefore, to &s;top thy mouth, O proud &s;inner, and to &s;till thy clamour again&s;t the righteous Judge, con&s;ider, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Thou art a &s;inner by nature, and it is highly rea&s;on|able that guilt and wrath be as old as &s;in. Why &s;hould not God begin to vindicate his honour, as &s;oon as vile worms begin to impare it? Why &s;hall not a &s;erpent bite the thief, as &s;oon as he leaps over the hedge? Why &s;hould not the threatning take hold of the &s;inner, as &s;oon as he ca&s;ts away the command? The poi&s;onous nature of the &s;erpent affords a man &s;ufficient ground to kill it, as &s;oon as ever he can reach it; and, by this time thou may&s;t be convinced, that thy nature is a very compound of enmity again&s;t God. <HI>Secondly,</HI> Thou ha&s;t not only an enmity again&s;t God, in thy nature; but ha&s;t di&s;covered it, by actual &s;ins, which are in his eye acts of ho&s;tility. Thou has brought forth thy lu&s;t into the field of battle again&s;t thy Sovereign LORD. And now, that thou art &s;uch a criminal, thy condemnation is ju&s;t: for, be&s;ides the &s;in of thy nature, thou ha&s;t done that again&s;t heaven, which

where were the proportion? Moreover, &s;in de&s;erves the mi&s;ery, but our be&s;t works do not de&s;erve the happine&s;s: yet both are &s;et before us; &s;in and mi&s;ery, holine&s;s and happine&s;s What rea&s;on is there then to complain? (2.) How &s;evere &s;oever the threatnings be, yet all has enough ado to reach the end of the law. <HI>Fear him,</HI> &s;ays our LORD, <HI>which, after he hath killed, hath power to ca&s;t into hell; yea, I &s;ay unto you, fear him,</HI> Luke xii. 5. This be&s;peaks our dread of divine power and maje&s;ty; but yet how few fear him indeed! The LORD knows the &s;inner's heart to be exceedingly intent upon fulfilling their lu&s;ts: they cleave &s;o fondly to tho&s;e ful&s;ome brea&s;ts, that a &s;mall force does not &s;uffice to draw them from them. They that travel through de&s;arts, where they are in hazard from wild bea&s;ts, have need to carry fire along with them: and they have need of a hard wedge that have knotty timber to cleave; &s;o a holy law mu&s;t be fenced with a dreadful wrath, in a world lying in wickedne&s;s. But who are they that com|plain of that wrath as too great&punc; but tho&s;e to whom it is too little to draw them off from their &s;inful cour&s;es? It was the man who pretended to fear his Lord, becau&s;e he was an au&s;tere man, that kept his <HI>pound laid up in a napkin:</HI> and &s;o he was <HI>condemned out of his own mouth,</HI> Luke xix. 20, 21.22. Thou art that man, even thou who&s;e objection I am an&s;wering. How can the wrath thou art under, and liable to, be too great, while yet it is not &s;ufficient to awaken thee to fly from it? Is it time to relax the penalties of the law, when men are tramp|ling the commands of it under foot? (3.) Con&s;ider how God dealt with his own Son, whom <HI>he &s;pared not,</HI> Rom. viii. 32. The wrath of God &s;eized on his &s;oul and body both, and brought him into the du&s;t of death. That his &s;ufferings were not eternal, flowed from the quality of the &s;ufferer, who was infinite; and therefore able to bear at once, the whole load of wrath: and upon that account, his &s;ufferings were infinite in value. But in value, they mu&s;t be protracted to an eternity. And what confidence can a rebel &s;ubject have to quarrel (for his part) a puni&s;hment execute on the King's Son? (4.) The &s;inner doth again&s;t God what he can. <HI>Behold thou ha&s;t done evil things as thou could&s;t,</HI> Jer. iii. 5. That thou ha&s;t not done more, and wor&s;e; thanks to him who re&s;trained thee; to the chain which the wolf was kept in by, not to thy&s;elf. No wonder God &s;hew his power on the &s;inner, who puts forth his power again&s;t God, as far as it will reach. The unregenerate man puts no period to his &s;inful cour&s;e; and would put no bounds to it neither, if he were not re&s;trained by divine power for wi&s;e ends: and therefore it is ju&s;t he be for ever under wrath. (5.) It is infinite maje&s;ty &s;in &s;trikes again&s;t; and &s;o it is, in &s;ome &s;ort, an infinite evil. Sin ri&s;eth in its demerit, according to the quality of the party offended. If a man wound his neighbour, his goods mu&s;t go for it; but if he wound his prince, his life mu&s;t go to make amends for that The infinity of God makes infinite wrath the ju&s;t demerit of &s;in. God is infinitely di&s;plea&s;ed with &s;in: and when he acts, he mu&s;t act like him&s;elf, and &s;hew his di&s;plea&s;ure by proportionable means.

<P N="1">I. To you that are yet in an unregenerate &s;tate, I would &s;ound the alarm, and warn you to &s;ee to your&s;elves, while yet there is hope. O ye children of wrath, take no re&s;t in this di&s;mal &s;tate; but flee to Je&s;us Chri&s;t the only refuge. Ha&s;te and make your e&s;cape thither. The &s;tate of wrath is too hot a climate for you to live in, Micah ii. 10. <HI>Ari&s;e ye and depart, for this is not your re&s;t.</HI> O &s;inner knowe&s;t thou where thou art?

If there were no hope of your recovery, we &s;hould be &s;ilent, and would not torment you before the time: but tho' ye be lo&s;t and undone, there is hope in <HI>I&s;rael</HI> concerning this thing.

better be a &s;lave to the <HI>Turks,</HI> condemned to the galleys, or under <HI>Egyptian</HI> bondage, than be under the covenant of works now. All mankind were brought under it in <HI>Adam,</HI> as we heard before: and thou in thy unregenerate &s;tate, are &s;till where <HI>Adam</HI> left thee. It is true, there is another covenant brought in: but what is that to thee, who art not brought into it? Thou mu&s;t needs be under one of the two covenants; either under the law, or under grace. That thou art not <HI>under grace, the dominion of &s;in</HI> over thee, manife&s;tly evinceth; therefore thou art under the law, Rom. vi. 14. Do not think God has laid a&s;ide the fir&s;t covenant, Matth. v. 17, 18. Gal. iii. 10. No, he will <HI>magnify the law, and make it honourable.</HI> It is broken indeed on thy part: but it is ab&s;urd to think, that therefore your obligation is di&s;&s;olved. Nay, thou mu&s;t &s;tand and fall by it, till thou can&s;t pro|duce thy di&s;charge from God him&s;elf, who is thy party in that cove|nant; and this thou can&s;t not pretend to, &s;eeing thou art not in Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Now, to give you a view of your mi&s;ery, in this re&s;pect, con&s;ider the&s;e following things, (1.) Hereby ye are bound over to death, in virtue of the threatning of death in that covenant, Gen. ii. 17. The condition being broken, ye fall under the penalty. So it concludes you under wrath. (2) There is no &s;alvation for you under this covenant, but on a condition impo&s;&s;ible to be performed by you. The ju&s;tice of God mu&s;t be &s;ati&s;fied for the wrong you have done already. God hath written this truth in characters of the blood of his own Son. Yea, and you mu&s;t perfectly obey the law for the time to come. So &s;aith the law, Gal. iii. 12. <HI>The man that doth them, &s;hall live in them.</HI> Come then, O &s;inner, &s;ee if thou can&s;t make a ladder, whereby thou may&s;t reach the throne of God; &s;tretch forth thine arms, and try, if thou can&s;t fly on the wings of the wind, catch hold of the clouds, and pierce through the&s;e vi&s;ible heavens; and then either climb over, or break through the ja&s;per walls of the city above. The&s;e things &s;halt thou do, as &s;oon as thou &s;halt reach heaven in thy natural &s;tate, or under this covenant. (3.) There is no pardon under this covenant. Pardon is the benefit of another covenant, with which thou ha&s;t noth|ing to do, Acts xiii. 9. <HI>And by him all that believe are ju&s;tified from all things, from which ye could not be ju&s;tified by the law of Mo&s;es.</HI> As for thee, thou art in the hand of a mercile&s;s creditor, which will take thee by the throat, &s;aying, <HI>Pay what thou owe&s;t;</HI> and ca&s;t thee into pri&s;on, there to remain, till thou ha&s;t paid the utmo&s;t farthing: unle&s;s thou bee&s;t &s;o wi&s;e as to get a cautioner in time, who is able to an&s;wer for all thy debt, and get up thy di&s;charge. This Je&s;us Chri&s;t alone can do. Thou abide&s;t under this covenant, and pleade&s;t mercy: but what is thy plea founded on? There is not one promi&s;e of mercy or pardon in that covenant. Do&s;t thou plead mercy, for mercy's &s;ake? Ju&s;tice will &s;tep in betwixt it and thee; and plead God's covenant threatning, which he cannot deny. (4) There's no place for repentance in this covenant &s;o as the &s;inner can be helped by it. For as &s;oon as ever thou &s;inne&s;t, the law lays its cur&s;e on thee, which is a dead weight

thou can&s;t by no means throw off; no, not tho' thine <HI>head were waters, and thine eyes a fountain of tears, to weep day and night</HI> for thy &s;in.

Now thou art another profane <HI>E&s;au,</HI> that hath &s;old the ble&s;&s;ing; and there is no place for repentance tho' thou &s;eeke&s;t it carefully with tears, while under that covenant. (5.) There is no accepting of the <HI>will</HI> for the <HI>deed</HI> under this covenant, which was not made for <HI>good will,</HI> but <HI>good works.</HI> The mi&s;take in this point ruins many. They are not in Chri&s;t, but &s;tand under the fir&s;t covenant; and yet they will plead this privilege. This is ju&s;t as if one having made a fea&s;t for tho&s;e of his own family, when they &s;it down at table, another man's &s;ervant that has run away from his ma&s;ter, &s;hould pre&s;umptuou&s;ly come forward and &s;it down among them: would not the ma&s;ter of the fea&s;t give &s;uch a &s;tranger that check, <HI>Friend, how came&s;t thou in hither?</HI> And &s;ince he is none of his family, command him to be gone quickly. Tho' a ma&s;ter accept the <HI>good will</HI> of his own child for the <HI>dead,</HI> can a hired &s;ervant expect that privilege? (6.) Ye have nothing to do with Chri&s;t, while under this covenant. By the law of God a woman cannot be married to two hu&s;bands at once: either death or divorce mu&s;t di&s;&s;olve the fir&s;t marriage, ere &s;he can marry another. So we mu&s;t fir&s;t be dead to the law, ere we can be married to Chri&s;t, Rom. vii. 4. The law is the fir&s;t hu&s;band; Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who rai&s;eth the dead, marries the widow, that was heart-broken, and &s;lain by the fir&s;t hu&s;band. But while the &s;oul is in the hou&s;e with the fir&s;t hu&s;band, it cannot plead a marriage-relation to Chri&s;t; nor the benefits of a marriage-covenant, which is not yet entered into, Gal. v. 4. <HI>Chri&s;t is become of no effect to you; who&s;oever of you are ju&s;tified by the law, ye are fallen from grace.</HI> Peace, pardon, and &s;uch like benefits are all benefits of the covenant of grace. And ye mu&s;t not think to &s;tand off from Chri&s;t, and the marriage-covenant with him, and yet plead the&s;e benefits; more than one man's wife can plead the benefit of a contract of marriage pa&s;t betwixt another man and his own wife. <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> See the bill of exclu&s;ion, pa&s;t in the court of heaven, again&s;t all under the covenant of works, Gal. iv. 30. <HI>The &s;on of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nd-woman &s;hall not be heir.</HI> compare ver. 24. Heirs of wrath mu&s;t not be heirs of glory. Whom the fir&s;t covenant hath power to exclude out of heaven, the &s;econd covenant cannot bring into it.</P>
<P><HI>Objection.</HI> Then it is impo&s;&s;ible for us to be &s;aved. <HI>An&s;wer,</HI> It is &s;o, while you are in that &s;tate. But if you would be out of that dreadful condition, ha&s;ten out of that &s;tate. If a murderer be under &s;entence of death, &s;o long as he lives within the kingdom, the laws will reach his life; but if he can make his e&s;cape, and get over the &s;ea, into the dominions of another prince, our laws cannot reach him there This is what we would have you to do: flee out of the king|dom of darkne&s;s, into <HI>the kingdom of God s dear Son;</HI> out of the do|minion of the law, into the dominion of grace; then all the cur&s;es of the law, or covenant of works, &s;hall never be able to reach you.</P>

Even in this world, many have been &s;et up as monuments of divine vengeance; that others might fear. Wrath has &s;wept away multitudes, who have fallen together by the hand of an angry God. Con&s;ider how the Lord <HI>&s;pared not the old world, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly: and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into a&s;hes, condemned them with an overthrow, making them an example unto tho&s;e that after &s;hould live ungodly,</HI> 2 Pet. ii. 5, 6.

Con&s;ider how wrath fell upon the fallen angels, who&s;e ca&s;e is ab&s;olutely hopele&s;s. They were the fir&s;t that ventured to break the hedge of the divine law; and God &s;et them up as monuments of his wrath again&s;t &s;in. They once left their own habitation, and were never allowed to look in again at the hole of the door; but they are <HI>re&s;erved in everla&s;ting chains under darkne&s;s, unto the judgment of the great day,</HI> Jude 6. <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> Behold how an angry God dealt with his own Son, &s;tanding in the room of elect &s;inners, Rom viii. 32. <HI>God &s;pared not his own Son.</HI> Sparing mercy might have been expected, if any at all. If any per&s;on could have obtained it &s;urely his own Son would have go it; but he &s;pared him not. The Father's delight is made a man of &s;orrows: he who is the wi&s;dom of God, becomes &s;ore amazed&punc; ready to faint away with a fit of horror.

and wi&s;dom; &s;o that none of thy &s;ins, however &s;ecret, can be hid from him. He infallibly finds out all means whereby wrath may be executed, toward the &s;atisfying of ju&s;tice. He is of infinite power, and &s;o can do what he will again&s;t the &s;inner. How heavy mu&s;t the &s;trokes of wrath be, which are laid on by an omnipotent hand! infinite power can make the &s;inner pri&s;oner, even when he is in his greate&s;t rage again&s;t heaven. It can bring again the &s;everal parcels of du&s;t, out of the grave; put them together again, reunite the &s;oul and the body, &s;i&s;t them before the tribunal, hurry them away to the pit, and hold them up with the one hand thro' eternity, while they are la&s;hed with the other. He is infinitely ju&s;t, and therefore mu&s;t puni&s;h; it were acting contrary to his nature to &s;uffer the &s;inner to e&s;cape wrath. Hence the executing of this wrath is plea&s;ing to him; for tho' the Lord hath no delight in the death of the &s;inner, as it is the de&s;truction of his own creature, yet he delights in it, as it is the execution of ju&s;tice. <HI>Upon the wicked he &s;hall rain &s;nares, fire and brim&s;tone, and an horrible tempe&s;t.</HI> Mark the rea&s;on, <HI>For the righteous Lord loveth righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> P&s;al. xi. 6, 7. <HI>I will cau&s;e my fury to re&s;t upon them, and I will be comforted,</HI> Ezek. v. 13. <HI>I al&s;o will laugh at your calamity,</HI> Prov. i. 26. <HI>Finally,</HI> He lives for ever, to pur&s;ue the quarrel.

<P>Be awakened then, O young &s;inner; be awakened, O old &s;inner, who art yet in the &s;tate thou wa&s;t born in. Your &s;ecurity is none of God's allowance, it is the &s;leep of death: ri&s;e out of it ere the pit clo&s;e its mouth on you. It is true, you may put on a brea&s;t-plate of iron, make your bow bra&s;s, and your hearts as an adamant: who can help it? But God will break that brazen bow, and make that adaman|tine heart, at la&s;t, to fly into a thou&s;and pieces. Ye may, if ye will, labour to put tho&s;e things out of your heads, that ye may yet &s;leep in a &s;ound &s;kin, tho' in a &s;tate of wrath. Ye may run away with the arrows &s;ticking in your con&s;ciences to your work, to work them away; or to your beds, to &s;leep them out; or to company, to &s;port and laugh them away: but convictions &s;o &s;tifled, will have a fearful re&s;urrection: and the day is coming, when the arrows of wrath &s;hall &s;o &s;tick in thy &s;oul, as thou &s;halt never be able to pluck them out thro' the ages of eternity, unle&s;s thou take warning in time.</P>

to ju&s;tify God in this matter. To quarrel with God about it, and to rage like a wild bull in a net, will but fix you the more in it. Humi|liation of &s;oul, before the Lord, is nece&s;&s;ary for an e&s;cape. God will not &s;ell deliverance, but freely gives it to tho&s;e, who &s;ee them&s;elves altogether unworthy of his favour. <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> Turn your eyes, O pri&s;oners of hope, towards the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and embrace him as he offereth him&s;elf, in the go&s;pel. <HI>There is no &s;alvation in any other,</HI> Acts iv. 12. God is a con&s;uming fire; ye are children of wrath: if the Mediator interpo&s;e not betwixt him and you, ye are undone for ever. If ye would be &s;afe, come under his &s;hadow: one drop of that wrath cannot fall there, for he <HI>delivereth us from the wrath to come,</HI> 1 The&s;&s;. i 10. Accept of him in his covenant, wherein he offereth him&s;elf to thee: and &s;o thou &s;halt, as the captive woman, redeem thy life, by marrying the Conqueror.

<P N="2">II. I &s;hall drop a few words to the &s;aints.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Remember, <HI>that at that time,</HI> (namely, when ye were in your natural &s;tate) <HI>ye were without Chri&s;t&mdash;having no hope, and without God in the world</HI> Call to mind that &s;tate, ye were in formerly; and re|view the mi&s;ery of it. There are five memorials, I may thence give in to the whole a&s;&s;embly of the &s;aints, who are no more children of wrath: but heirs of God, and joint heirs with Chri&s;t, tho as yet in their minority. (1) Remember, that in the day our Lord took you by the hand, ye were in no better condition than others? O what moved him to take you, when he pa&s;t by your neighbours! he found you children of wrath, even as others; but he did not leave you &s;o. He came into the common pri&s;on, where you lay in your fetters, even as others: and from among&s;t the multitude of condemned malefactors, he picked out you, commanded your fetters to be taken off, put a pardon in your hand, and brought you into the glorious liberty of the children of God; while he left others in the devil's fetters. (2) Re|member there was nothing in you to engage him to love you, in the day he fir&s;t appeared for your deliverance Ye were children of wrath, even as others, fit for hell, and altogether unfit for heaven: yet the King brought you into the palace: the King's Son made love to you a condemned criminal, and e&s;pou&s;ed you to him&s;elf, on the day in which ye might have had been led forth to execution. <HI>Even &s;o, Father, for &s;o it &s;eemeth good in the &s;ight,</HI> Matth ix. 26. (3) Remember, ye were fitter to be lothed than loved in that day. Wonder, that when he &s;aw you in your blood, he looked not at you with abhorrence, and pa&s;&s;ed by you. Wonder that ever &s;uch a time could be <HI>a time of love,</HI> Ezek xvi. 8. (4.) Remember, ye are decked with borrowed feathers. It is his comeline&s;s, which is upon you, ver 14. It was he that took off your pri&s;on garments, and clothed you with robes of righteou&s;ne&s;s, garments of &s;alvation garments where with ye are arrayed as the lilies, which toil not, neither do they &s;pin. He took the child<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> from off your
<PB N="116" REF="045042_0113_101F7DEB21341F40">
arms, the rope from about your neck; put you in &s;uch a dre&s;s as ye might be fit for the court of heaven, even to eat at the King's table. (5.) <HI>Remember your faults this day;</HI> as <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s butler, who had forgotten <HI>Jo&s;eph.</HI> Mind how you have forgotten, and how unkindly you have treated him, who remembred you in your low e&s;tate. <HI>Is this your kindne&s;s to your friend?</HI> In the day of your deliverance, did ye think, ye could have thus required him, your Lord?</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Pity the children of wrath, the world that lies in wicked|ne&s;s. Can ye be unconcerned for them, ye who were once in the &s;ame condition? Ye have got a&s;hore indeed, but your fellows are yet in hazard of peri&s;hing; and will not ye make them all po&s;&s;ible help for their deliverance? What they are, ye &s;ometimes were This may draw pity from you, and engage you to u&s;e all means for their recovery. See Tit. iii. 1, 2, 3.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Admire that matchle&s;s love, which brought you out of the &s;tate of wrath Chri&s;t's love was active love, he <HI>loved thy &s;oul from the pit of corruption.</HI> It was no ea&s;y work to purcha&s;e the life of the condemned &s;inner? but he gave his life for thy life. He gave his precious blood to quench that flame of wrath, which otherwi&s;e would have burnt thee up. Men get the be&s;t view of the &s;tars, from the bottom of a deep pit: from this pit of mi&s;ery into which thou wa&s;t ca&s;t by the fir&s;t <HI>Adam,</HI> thou may&s;t get the be&s;t view of the Sun of righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, in all its dimen&s;ions. He is the &s;econd <HI>Adam,</HI> who took thee out of the horrible pit, and out of the miry clay. How broad were the &s;kirts of that love, which covered &s;uch a multitude of &s;ins! behold the length of it, reaching <HI>from everla&s;ting to everla&s;ting,</HI> P&s;al. ciii 17. The depth of it, going &s;o low as to deliver thee <HI>from the lowe&s;t hell,</HI> P&s;al. lxxxvi. 13. The height of it, in rai&s;ing thee up to <HI>&s;it in heavenly places,</HI> Eph. ii. 6.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> Be humble, carry low &s;ails, walk &s;oftly all your years&punc; Be not proud of your gifts, graces, privileges, or attainments: but remember ye were children of wrath, even as others. The peacock walks &s;lowly, hangs down his &s;tarry feathers, while he looks to his black feet. <HI>Look ye to the hole of the pit, whence ye are digged,</HI> and walk humbly as it becomes free grace's debtors.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> Be wholly for your Lord. Every wife is obliged to be dutiful to her hu&s;band; but double <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">es lie upon her who was taken from a pri&s;on or a dunghill. If your Lord has delivered you from wrath, ye ought, upon that very account, to be wholly his: to act for him, to &s;uffer for him and to do whatever he calls you to. The &s;aints have no rea&s;on to complain of their lot in the world, whatever it be. Well may they bear the cro&s;s for him, by whom the cur&s;e was born away from them. Well may they bear the wrath of men, in his cau&s;e, who has freed them from the wrath of God; and chearfully go to a fire for him, by whom hell-fire is quenched to them. Soul and body, and all thou had&s;t in the world, were &s;ometimes under wrath: he has removed that wrath, had not all the&s;e be at his &s;ervice&punc; That
<PB N="117" REF="045042_0114_101F7DECCAFDE760">
thy &s;oul is not overwhelmed with the wrath of God, is owing purely to Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and &s;hall it not then be a temple for his Spirit? That thy heart is not filled with horror and de&s;pair, is owing to him only; to whom then &s;hould it be devoted but to him alone? That thine eyes are not blinded with the &s;moak of the pit, thy hands are not fertered with chains of darkne&s;s, thy tongue is not broiling in the fire of hell, and thy feet are not &s;tanding in that lake that burns with fire and brim&s;tone, is owing purely to Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and &s;hall not the&s;e eyes be employed for him, the&s;e hands act for him, that tongue &s;peak for him, and the&s;e feet &s;peedily run his errands? To him who believes that he was a child of wrath, even as others, but is now delivered by the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us; nothing will appear too much, to do or &s;uffer for his deliverer, when he has a fair call to it.</P>
<P N="3">III. To conclude with a word to all; let no man think lightly of &s;in, which lays the &s;inner open to the wrath of God. Let not the &s;in of our nature, which wreaths the yoke of God's wrath, &s;o early, about our necks, &s;eem a &s;mall thing in our eyes. Fear the Lord, be|cau&s;e of his dreadful wrath. Tremble at the thought of &s;in, again&s;t which God has &s;uch fiery indignation. Look on his wrath, and &s;tand in awe, and &s;in not. Do you think this is to pre&s;s you to &s;lavi&s;h fear? If it were &s;o, one had better be a &s;lave to God with a trembling heart; than a free man to the devil, with a feared con&s;cience and a heart of adamant. But it is not &s;o, you may love him, and thus fear him too; yea, ye ought to do it, though ye were &s;aints of the fir&s;t magnitude. See P&s;al. cxix. 10. Matth. x. 28. Luke xii. 5. Heb. xii 28, 29. Altho' ye have pa&s;t the gulf of wrath, being in <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> yet it is but rea&s;onable, your hearts &s;hiver, when ye look back to it. Your &s;in &s;till de&s;erves wrath even as the &s;ins of others: and it would be terrible to be in a fiery furnace; altho' by a miracle, we were &s;o fenced again&s;t it, as that it could not harm us.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WE have now had a view of the total corruption of man's nature, and that load of wrath which lies on him, that gulf of mi&s;ery he is plunged into in his natural &s;tate. But there's one part of his mi&s;ery that de&s;erves particular con&s;ideration; namely, his utter inabi|lity to recover him&s;elf, the knowledge of which is nece&s;&s;ary for the
<PB N="118" REF="045042_0115_101F7DF347EF8268">
due humiliation of a &s;inner. What I de&s;ign here is, only to propo&s;e a few things, whereby to convince the unregenerate man of this his inability; that he may &s;ee an ab&s;olute need of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and of the power of his grace.</P>
<P>As a man that is fallen into a pit, cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to help him|&s;elf out of it, but by one of two ways; either by doing all him&s;elf alone, or taking hold of, and improving the help offered him by others: &s;o an unconverted man cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to help him&s;elf out of that &s;tate, but either in the way of the law, or covenant of warks, by doing all him&s;elf without Chri&s;t: or el&s;e in the way of the go&s;pel, or cove|nant of grace, by exerting his own &s;trength to lay hold upon, and to make u&s;e of the help offered him by a Saviour. But alas! the un|converted man is dead in the pit, and cannot help him&s;elf, either of the&s;e ways. Not the fir&s;t way: for the fir&s;t text tells us, that when our Lord came to help us, <HI>we were without &s;trength,</HI> unable to recover our&s;elves. We were ungodly; therefore under a burden of guilt and wrath; yet without &s;trength, unable to &s;tand under it: and un|able to throw it off, or get from under it: &s;o that all mankind had undoubtedly peri&s;hed, had not Chri&s;t died for the ungodly, and brought help to them who could never have recovered them&s;elves But when Chri&s;t comes, and offereth help to &s;inners, cannot they take it? Cannot they improve help when it comes to their hands? No, the &s;econd text tells us, they cannot: <HI>No man can come unto me, (i e.</HI> believe in me, John vi. 35.) <HI>except the Father draw him.</HI> This is a drawing which enables them to come who till then could not come; and therefore could not help them&s;elves, by improving the help offered It is a drawing, which is always effectual; for it can be no le&s;s than hearing and learning of the Father, which who&s;o partakes of, cometh to Chri&s;t, ver 25 Therefore, it is not drawing in the way of mere moral &s;ua&s;ion, which may be, yea, and always is ineffectual: but it is draw|ing by mighty power, Ephe&s;. i. 19 ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for them that have no power in them&s;elves, to come and take hold of the offered help.</P>
<P>Hearken then, O unregenerate man, and be convinced, that as thou art in a mo&s;t mi&s;erable &s;tate by nature; &s;o thou art utterly unable to recover thy&s;elf, any manner of way. Thou art ruined; and what way wilt thou go to work, to recover thy&s;elf? Which of the&s;e two ways wilt thou chu&s;e? Wilt thou try it alone? Or wilt thou make u&s;e of help? Wilt thou fall on the way of works, or on the way of the go&s;pel? I know very well, thou wilt not &s;o much as try the way of the go&s;pel, till once thou ha&s;t found the recovery impracticable, in the way of the law. Therefore we &s;hall begin, where corrupt nature teaches men to begin, <HI>viz.</HI> at the way of the law of works.</P>
<P N="1">I. Sinner, I would have thee believe that thy working will never effect it. Work and do thy be&s;t; thou &s;halt never be able to work thy&s;elf out of this &s;tate of corruption and wrath. Thou mu&s;t have Chri&s;t, el&s;e thou &s;halt peri&s;h eternally. It is only Chri&s;t in you, can be the hope of glory. But if thou wilt needs try it; then I mu&s;t lay
<PB N="119" REF="045042_0116_101F7DF6DAA63460">
before thee, from the unalterable word of the living God, two things which thou mu&s;t do for thy&s;elf. And if thou can&s;t do them: it mu&s;t be yielded, that thou art able to recover thy&s;elf; but if not, then thou can&s;t do nothing this way, for thy recovery.</P>
<P>FIRST, <HI>If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments,</HI> Matth. xix. 17. That is, if thou wilt by doing, enter into life, then perfectly keep the ten commands. For the &s;cope of the&s;e words is, to beat down the pride of man's heart; and to let him &s;ee the ab&s;olute need of a Saviour, from the impo&s;&s;ibility of keeping the law. The an&s;wer is given, &s;uitable to the addre&s;s. Our Lord checks him for his com|pliment, <HI>Good Ma&s;ter,</HI> ver. 16. telling him, <HI>There is none good, but One, that is God,</HI> ver. 17. As if he had &s;aid, you think your&s;elf a good man, and me another? but where goodne&s;s is &s;poken of, men and angels may vail their faces before the good God. And as to his que&s;tion, wherein he di&s;covered his legal di&s;po&s;ition, Chri&s;t does not an&s;wer him, &s;aying, <HI>Believe and thou &s;halt be &s;aved;</HI> that would not have been &s;o &s;ea&s;onable in the ca&s;e of one, who thought he could do well enough for him&s;elf, if he but knew, what good things he &s;hould do; but, &s;uit|able to the humour the man was in, he bid him <HI>keep the commandments;</HI> keep them nicely and accurately, as tho&s;e that watch malefactors in pri&s;on, le&s;t any of them e&s;cape, and their life go for their's. See then, O unregenerate man, what can&s;t thou do in this matter; for if thou wilt recover thy&s;elf in this way, thou mu&s;t perfectly keep the commandments of God.</P>
<P>And, (1.) Thy obedience mu&s;t be perfect, in re&s;pect of the prin|ciple of it; that is, thy &s;oul, the principle of action, mu&s;t be per|fectly pure, and altogether without &s;in. For the law requires all moral perfection; not only actual, but habitual, and &s;o condemns original &s;in; impurity of nature, as well as of actions. Now, if thou can&s;t bring this to pa&s;s; thou &s;halt be able to an&s;wer that que&s;tion of Solomon's, &s;o, as never one of Adam's po&s;terity could yet an&s;wer it, Prov. xx 9 <HI>Who can &s;ay, I have made my heart clean?</HI> But if thou can&s;t not, the very want of this perfection is a &s;in; and &s;o lays thee open to the cur&s;e, and cuts thee off from life. Yea, it makes all thine actions, even thy be&s;t actions &s;inful, <HI>for who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?</HI> Job xiv. 4. And do&s;t thou think by &s;in, to help thy&s;elf out of &s;in and mi&s;ery? (2.) Thy obedience mu&s;t al&s;o be perfect in parts. It mu&s;t be as broad as the whole law of God: if thou lacke&s;t one thing, thou art undone; for the law de|nounceth the cur&s;e on him that continueth not in every thing written therein, Gal. iii. 10. Thou mu&s;t give internal and external obedi|ence to the whole law; keep all the commands, in heart and life. If thou breake&s;t any one of them, that will in&s;ure thy ruin. A vain thought, or idle word, will &s;till &s;hut thee up under the cur&s;e. (3.) It mu&s;t be perfect in re&s;pect of degrees; as was the obedience of <HI>Adam,</HI> while he &s;tood in his innocence. This the law requires, and will ac|cept of no le&s;s, Mat. xxii. 37. <HI>Thou &s;halt love the Lord thy God, with
<PB N="120" REF="045042_0117_101F7DFA9AC55908">
all thy heart, and with all thy &s;oul, and with all thy mind.</HI> If one de|gree of that love required by the law, be wanting; if each part of thy obedience be not &s;crewed up to the greate&s;t height commanded; that want is a breach of the law, and &s;o leaves thee &s;till under the cur&s;e. One may bring as many buckets of water to a hou&s;e that is on fire, as he is able to carry, and yet it may be con&s;umed; and will be &s;o, if he bring not as many as will quench the fire. Even &s;o, al|though thou &s;hould&s;t do what thou art able, in keeping the commands; if thou fail in the lea&s;t degree of obedience which the law enjoins, thou art certainly ruined for ever; unle&s;s thou take hold of Chri&s;t, renoun|cing all thy righteou&s;ne&s;s as filthy rags. See Rom. x. 5. Gal. iii. 10. <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> It mu&s;t be perpetual, as the man Chri&s;t's obedience was, who always did the things that plea&s;ed the Father; for the tenor of the law is, <HI>Cur&s;ed is he that continueth not in all things written in the law, to do them.</HI> Hence, tho' <HI>Adam</HI>'s obedience was for a while ab&s;olutely perfect; yet becau&s;e at length he tripped in one point, <HI>viz.</HI> in eating the forbidden fruit, he fell under the cur&s;e of the law. If one &s;hould live a dutiful &s;ubject to his prince, till the clo&s;e of his days, and then con&s;pire again&s;t him; he mu&s;t die for his trea&s;on. Even &s;o, tho' thou &s;hould&s;t, all the time of thy life, live in perfect obedience to the law of God; and only, at the hour of death, entertain a vain thought, or pronounce an idle word: that idle word, or vain thought, would blot out all thy former righteou&s;ne&s;s, and ruin thee; namely, in this way, in which thou art &s;eeking to recover thy&s;elf.</P>
<P>Now &s;uch is the obedience thou mu&s;t perform, if thou would&s;t re|cover thy&s;elf in the way of the law. But tho' thou &s;hould&s;t thus obey: the law &s;takes thee down in the &s;tate of wrath, till another demand of it be &s;atisfied, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>SECONDLY, Thou mu&s;t pay what thou owe&s;t It is undeniable thou art a &s;inner; and whatever thou maye&s;t be in time to come, ju&s;tice mu&s;t be &s;atisfied for thy &s;in already committed. The honour of the law mu&s;t be maintained, by thy &s;uffering the denounced wrath. It may be thou ha&s;t changed thy cour&s;e of life, or art now re&s;olved to do it, and &s;et about the keeping of the commands of God: but what ha&s;t thou done, or what wilt thou do, with the old debt? Your obe|dience to God, tho' it were perfect, is a debt due to him, for the time wherein it is performed; and can no more &s;atisfy for former &s;ins, than a tenant's paying the current year's rent, can &s;atisfy the ma&s;ter for all bygones. Can the paying of new debts acquit a man from old ac|counts? Nay, deceive not your&s;elves, you will find the&s;e laid up in &s;tore with God, <HI>and &s;ealed up among his trea&s;ures,</HI> Deut. xxxii. 34. It remains then, that either thou mu&s;t bear that wrath, to which, for thy &s;in, thou art liable according to the law; or el&s;e, thou mu&s;t acknow|ledge thou can&s;t not bear it, and thereupon have recour&s;e to the &s;ure|ty, the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t: Let me now a&s;k thee, art thou able to &s;atisfy the ju&s;tice of God? Can&s;t thou pay thy own debt? Surely not: for, &s;eeing he is an infinite God, whom thou ha&s;t offended; the
<PB N="121" REF="045042_0118_101F7E00C2646188">
puni&s;hment, being &s;uited to the quality of the offence, mu&s;t be infinite. But &s;o it is, thy puni&s;hment, or &s;ufferings for &s;in, cannot be infinite in value, &s;eeing thou art a finite creature: therefore they mu&s;t be in|finite in duration or continuance; that is, they mu&s;t be eternal. And &s;o all thy &s;ufferings in this world, are but an earne&s;t of what thou mu&s;t &s;uffer in the world to come.</P>
<P>Now, &s;inner, if thou can&s;t an&s;wer the&s;e demands, thou may&s;t re|cover thy&s;elf in the way of the law. But art thou not con&s;cious of thy inability to do any of the&s;e things, much more to do them all? Yet if thou do not all, thou do&s;t nothing. Turn then to what cour&s;e of life thou wilt, thou art &s;till in a &s;tate of wrath. Screw up thy obe|dience to the greate&s;t height thou can&s;t; &s;uffer what God lays upon thee, yea add, if thou wilt to the burden, and walk under all, without the lea&s;t impatience: yet all this will not &s;atisfy the demands of the law; and therefore thou art &s;till a ruined creature. Alas! &s;inner, what art thou doing, while thou &s;trive&s;t to help thy&s;elf; but do&s;t not receive and unite with <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t?</HI> Thou art labouring in the fire, wearying thy&s;elf for very vanity; labouring to enter into heaven by the door, which <HI>Adam</HI>'s &s;in &s;o bolted, as neither he, nor any of his lo&s;t po&s;terity can ever enter by it. Do&s;t thou not &s;ee the flaming &s;word of ju&s;tice keeping thee off from the tree of life? Do&s;t thou not hear the law denouncing a cur&s;e on thee for all thou art doing; even for thy obedience, thy prayers, thy tears, thy reformation of life, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> becau&s;e being under the law's dominion, thy be&s;t works are not &s;o good, as it requires them to be, under the pain of the cur&s;e? Believe it, &s;irs, if you live and die out of Chri&s;t, without being actually united to him as the &s;econd <HI>Adam,</HI> a life-giving Spirit, and without coming under the covert of his atoning blood; though you &s;hould do the utmo&s;t that any man on earth can do, in keeping the commands of GOD, ye &s;hall never &s;ee the face of GOD in peace.

<HI>An&s;.</HI> (1.) Though thou art able to do many things, thou art not able to do one thing aright: thou can&s;t do nothing acceptable to God, be|ing out of Chri&s;t, John xv. 5. <HI>Without me ye can do nothing.</HI> An un|renewed man, as thou art, can do nothing but &s;in; as we have already evinced. Thy be&s;t actions are &s;in, and &s;o they increa&s;e thy debt to ju&s;tice; how then can it be expected they &s;hould le&s;&s;en it? (2) If God &s;hould offer to &s;ave men upon condition that they did all they could do, in obedience to his commands: we have ground to think, that the&s;e who would betake them&s;elves to that way, &s;hould never be &s;aved. For where is the man, that does <HI>as well as he can?</HI> Who &s;ees not many fal&s;e &s;teps he has made, which he might have evited? There are &s;o many things to be done, &s;o many temptations to carry us out of the road of duty, and our nature is &s;o very apt to be &s;et on fire of hell; that we would &s;urely fail, even in &s;ome point, that is within the compa&s;s of our natural abilities. But (3.) Though thou &s;hould&s;t do all thou art able to do, in vain do&s;t thou hope to be &s;aved in that way. What word of God is this hope of thine founded on? It is neither founded on law nor go&s;pel, and therefore it is but a delu&s;ion. It is not founded on the go&s;pel; for the go&s;pel leads the &s;oul out of it&s;elf, to Je&s;us Chri&s;t for all: and it <HI>e&s;tabli&s;heth the law,</HI> Rom. iii. 31. whereas this hope of yours cannot be e&s;tabli&s;hed, but on the ruin of the law, which God will <HI>magnify and make honourable.</HI> And hence it appears, that it is not founded on the law neither. When God &s;et <HI>Adam</HI> a working for happine&s;s to him&s;elf, and his po&s;terity, perfect obedience was the condition required of him; and a cur&s;e was de|nounced in ca&s;e of di&s;obedience. The law being broken by him, he and his po&s;terity were &s;ubjected to the penalty, for &s;in committed; and withal &s;till bound to perfect obedience: for it is ab&s;urd to think that man's &s;inning and &s;uffering for his &s;in, &s;hould free him from his duty of obedience to his Creator. When Chri&s;t came in the room of the elect, to purcha&s;e their &s;alvation, the &s;ame were the terms. Ju&s;tice had the elect under arre&s;t: if he minds to deliver them, the terms are known. He mu&s;t &s;atisfy for their &s;in, by &s;uffering the puni&s;hment due to it; he mu&s;t do what they cannot do, viz. <HI>obey</HI> the law perfectly, and &s;o fulfil all righteou&s;ne&s;s. Accordingly, all this he did, and &s;o became <HI>the end of the law for righteou&s;ne&s;s to every one that believeth,</HI> Rom x. 4. And now do&s;t thou think God will abate of the&s;e terms to thee, when his own Son got no abatement of them? Expect it not, though thou &s;hould&s;t beg it with tears of blood; for if they prevailed, they behoved to prevail again&s;t the truth, ju&s;tice and honour of God, Gal. iii. 10. <HI>Cur&s;ed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of the law, to do them.</HI> Ver. 22. <HI>And the law is not of faith, but the man that doth them, &s;hall live in them.</HI> It is true, that God is merciful&punc; he cannot but be merciful, unle&s;s he &s;ave you in a way that is neither con&s;i&s;tent with his law nor go&s;pel? Hath not his goodne&s;s and mercy &s;ufficiently appeared, in &s;ending the Son of his love, to do <HI>what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the

fle&s;h?</HI> He has provided help for them that cannot help them&s;elves: but thou, in&s;en&s;ible of thine own weakne&s;s, wilt needs think to recover thy&s;elf by thine own works; while thou art no more able to do it, than to remove mountains of bra&s;s out of their place</P>
<P>Wherefore I conclude thou art utterly unable to recover thy&s;elf, by the way of works, or of the law. O that thou would&s;t conclude the &s;ame concerning thy&s;elf!</P>
<P N="2">II. Let us try next, what the &s;inner can do to recover him&s;elf, in the way of the go&s;pel: It is likely, thou thinke&s;t, that howbeit thou can&s;t not do all, by thy&s;elf alone; yet Je&s;us Chri&s;t offering thee help, thou can&s;t of thy&s;elf embrace it, and u&s;e it to thy recovery. But, O &s;inner, be convinced of thine ab&s;olute need of the grace of Chri&s;t, for truly there is help offered, but thou can&s;t not accept of it: there is a rope ca&s;t out to hale &s;hip-wrecked &s;inners to land: but alas! they have no hands to catch hold of it. They are like infants expo&s;ed in the open field, that mu&s;t &s;tarve, tho' their food be lying by them, unle&s;s one put it into their mouths. To convince natural men of this, let it be con&s;idered,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That although Chri&s;t is offered in the go&s;pel, yet they cannot believe in him. Saving faith is <HI>the faith of God's elect;</HI> the &s;pecial gift of God to them, wrought in them by his Spirit. Salvation is offered to them that will believe in Chri&s;t; but how can ye believe? John v. 44. It is offered to the&s;e that will come to Chri&s;t; but <HI>no man can come unto him, except the Father draw him.</HI> It is offered to them that will look to him, as lifted up on the pole of the go&s;pel, I&s;a. xiv 22. but the natural man is &s;piritually blind. Rev iii. 17. and as to the things of the Spirit of God, he cannot know them, for they are &s;piritually di&s;cerned, 1 Cor. ii. 14. Nay, who&s;oever will, he is welcome; let him come. Rev. xxii. 17. But there mu&s;t be a day of power on the &s;inner, before he will be willing, P&s;al cx. 3.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Man naturally has nothing, wherewithal to improve, to his recovery, the help brought in by the go&s;pel. He is ca&s;t away in a &s;tate of wrath; but is bound hand and foot, &s;o that he cannot lay hold of the cords of love, thrown out to him in the go&s;pel. The mo&s;t &s;kilful artificer cannot work without in&s;truments, nor can the mo&s;t cunning mu&s;ician play well on an in&s;trument that is out of tune. How can one believe, how can he repent, who&s;e under&s;tanding is darkne&s;s, Eph. v 8 who&s;e heart is a &s;tony heart, inflexible, in&s;en&s;ible, Ezek. xxxvi. 26. who&s;e affections are wholly di&s;ordered and d&s;tem|pered; who is aver&s;e to good, and bent to evil? The arms of natural abilities are too &s;hort to reach &s;upernatural help: hence tho&s;e who mo&s;t excel in them, are oft times mo&s;t e&s;tranged from &s;piritual things, Matth. xi 24 <HI>Thou ha&s;t hid the&s;e things from the wi&s;e and prudent.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Man cannot work a &s;aving change on him&s;elf: but &s;o changed he mu&s;t be, el&s;e he can neither believe nor repent, nor ever &s;ee heaven No action can be without a &s;uitable principle. Believing, repenting, and the like, are the product of the new nature; and can

never be produced by the old corrupt nature. Now, what can the natural man do in this matter? He mu&s;t be regenerate, <HI>begotten again into a bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">:</HI> but as the child cannot be active in his own genera|tion; &s;o a man cannot be active but pa&s;&s;ive only, in his own regene|ration. The heart is &s;hut again&s;t Chri&s;t: man cannot open it, only God can do it by his grace, Acts xvi. 14. He is dead in &s;in: he mu&s;t be quickned rai&s;ed out of his grave: who can do this but God him&s;elf? Eph. ii 1, 5. Nay, he mu&s;t be <HI>created in Chri&s;t Je&s;us unto good works,</HI> Eph ii. 10. The&s;e are works of omnipotency, and can be done by no le&s;s power.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> Man, in his depraved &s;tate, is under an utter inability to do any thing truly good as was cleared before at large: how then can he obey the go&s;pel? His nature is the very rever&s;e of the go&s;pel: how can he, of him&s;elf, fall in with that device of &s;alvation, and accept the offered remedy? The corruption of man's nature infallibly concludes his utter inability to recover him&s;elf any manner of way: and who&s;o is convinced of the one, mu&s;t needs admit the other; for they &s;tand and fall together. Were all the purcha&s;e of Chri&s;t offered to the un|regenerate man, for one good thought, he cannot command it, 2 Cor. iii. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. <HI>Not that we are &s;ufficient of our&s;elves, to think any thing as of our|&s;elves.</HI> Were it offered on condition of a good word, yet <HI>how can ye, being evil, &s;peak good things?</HI> Matth xii. 35. Nay, were it left to your&s;elves, to chu&s;e what is ea&s;ie&s;t; Chri&s;t him&s;elf tells you, John xv. 5. <HI>Without me, ye can do nothing.</HI></P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> The natural man cannot but re&s;i&s;t the Lord, offering to help him; howbeit that re&s;i&s;tance is infallibly overcome in the elect, by converting grace. Can the &s;tony heart chu&s;e but re&s;i&s;t the &s;troke? There is not only an inability, but an enmity and ob&s;tinacy in man's <HI>will</HI> by nature. God knows, natural man, (whether thou knowe&s;t it or not) that <HI>thou art ob&s;tinate, and thy neck is an iron &s;inew, and thy brow bra&s;s,</HI> I&s;a. xlviii. 4. and cannot be overcome, but by him, who hath <HI>broken the gates of bra&s;s, and cut the bars of iron in &s;und<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r.</HI> Hence is there &s;uch hard work in converting a &s;inner Sometimes he &s;eems to be caught in the net of the go&s;pel; yet quickly he &s;lips away again. The hook catcheth hold of him: but he &s;truggles, till getting free of it, he makes away with a bleeding wound. When good hopes are conceived of him, by the&s;e that travel in birth, for the forming of of Chri&s;t in him; there is oft-times nothing brought forth but wind. The deceitful heart makes many a &s;hift to avoid a Saviour, and to cheat the man of his eternal happine&s;s. Thus the natural man lies &s;unk in a &s;tate of &s;in and wrath, utterly unable to recover him&s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> (1.) If we be under an utter inability to do any good, how <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">an God require us to do it? <HI>An&s;.</HI> God making man upright, Eccle&s;. vii. 29. gave him a power to do every thing he &s;hould require of him: this power, man lo&s;t by his own fault. We were bound to &s;erve God, and to do what&s;oever he commanded us, as being his creatures; and al&s;o, we were under the &s;uperadded tye of a covenant, for that

effect. Now, we having, by our own fault, di&s;abled our&s;elves; &s;hall God lo&s;e his right of requiring our ta&s;k, becau&s;e we have thrown away the &s;trength he gave us, wherewithal to perform it? Has the creditor no right to require payment of his money, becau&s;e the debitor has &s;quandered it away, and is not able to pay him? Truly, if God can require no more of us than we are able to do; we need no more to &s;ave us from wrath, but to make our&s;elves unable for every duty, and to incapacitate our&s;elves for &s;erving of God any manner of way, as profane men frequently do: and &s;o the deeper one is immer&s;ed in &s;in, he will be the more &s;ecure from wrath; for where God can re|quire no duty of us, we do not &s;in in omitting it; and where there is no &s;in, there can be no wrath. (As to what may be urged by the unhumbled &s;oul, again&s;t the putting of our &s;tock in <HI>Adam</HI>'s hand; the righteou&s;ne&s;s of that di&s;pen&s;ation was cleared before.) But more|over, the unrenewed man is daily throwing away the very remains of natural abilities; that light and &s;trength which are to be found among&s;t the ruins of mankind. Nay, farther, he will not believe his own utter inability to help him&s;elf; &s;o that out of his own mouth he will be condemned. Even tho&s;e who make their natural impotency to good, a cover to their &s;loth, do, with others, delay the work of turning to God from time to time; under convictions, make large promi&s;es of reformation, which afterward they never regard; and delay their repentance to a death-bed, as if they could help them&s;elves in a mo|ment; which &s;peaks them to be far from a due &s;en&s;e of their natural inability, whatever they pretend.</P>
<P>Now, if God can require of men, the duty they are not able to do; he can, in ju&s;tice, puni&s;h them for their not doing it, notwith&s;tanding of their inability. If he have power to exact the debt of obedience, he has al&s;o power to ca&s;t the in&s;olvent debtor in his pri&s;on, for his not paying it. Further, tho' unregenerate men have no gracious abilities; yet they want not natural abilities, which neverthele&s;s they will not improve. There are many things they can do, which they do not, they will not do them; and therefore, their damnation will be ju&s;t, Nay, all their inability to good is voluntary; they will not come to Chri&s;t, John v. 40. They will not repent, they will die, Ezek. xviii. 51. So they will be ju&s;tly condemned: becau&s;e they will not turn to God, nor come to Chri&s;t; but love their chains better than their liberty, and darkne&s;s rather than light, John iii. 10.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> (2.) Why do you then preach Chri&s;t to us; call us to come to him, to believe, repent, and u&s;e the means of &s;alvation? <HI>An&s;</HI> Becau&s;e it is your duty &s;o to do. It is your duty to accept of Chri&s;t as he is offered in the go&s;pel; to repent of your &s;ins, and to be holy in all manner of conver&s;ation: the&s;e things are commanded you of God; and his command, not your ability, is the mea&s;ure of your duty. Moreover, the&s;e calls and exhortations, are the means that God is plea&s;ed to make u&s;e of, for converting his elect, and working grace in their hearts: to them, <HI>faith cometh by hearing,</HI> Rom. x. 17. while they
<PB N="126" REF="045042_0123_101F7E11EA66B4B0">
are as unable to help them&s;elves as the re&s;t of mankind are. Upon very good grounds may we, at the command of God, <HI>who rai&s;eth the dead,</HI> go to their graves, and cry in his name, <HI>awake thou that &s;leepe&s;t, and ri&s;e from the dead, and Chri&s;t &s;hall give thee light,</HI> Eph. v. 14. And &s;eeing the elect are not to be known, and di&s;tingui&s;hed from others before conver&s;ion: as the &s;un &s;hines on the blind man's face, and the rain falls on the rocks as well as on the fruitful plains; &s;o we preach Chri&s;t to all, and &s;hoot the arrow at a venture, which God him&s;elf directs as he &s;ees meet. Moreover the&s;e calls and exhortati|ons are not altogether in vain, even to tho&s;e that are not converted by them. Such per&s;ons may be convinced, tho' they be not converted: altho' they be not &s;anctified by the&s;e means; yet they may be re&s;trained by them, from running into that exce&s;s of wickedne&s;s, which other|wi&s;e they would arrive at. The means of grace &s;erve, as it were, to embalm many dead &s;ouls, which are never quickned by them; tho' they do not re&s;tore them to life; yet they keep them from &s;melling &s;o rank as otherwi&s;e they would do. <HI>Finally,</HI> Tho' ye cannot recover your&s;elves; nor take hold of the &s;aving help offered to you in the go&s;pel: yet even by the power of nature, ye may u&s;e the outward and ordinary means, whereby Chri&s;t communicates the benefits of redemp|tion to ruined &s;inners, who are utterly unable to recover them&s;elves out of the &s;tate of &s;in and wrath. Ye may, and can, if ye plea&s;e, do many things, that would &s;et you in a fair way for help from the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Ye may go &s;o far on, as to be not far from the king|dom of God, as the di&s;creet &s;cribe had done, Mark xii. 34. tho' (it would &s;eem) he was de&s;titute of &s;upernatural abilities. Tho' ye cannot cure your&s;elves; yet ye may come to the pool, where many &s;uch di&s;ea&s;ed per&s;ons as ye are, have been cured: ye have none to put you into it, yet ye may ly at the &s;ide of it: and <HI>who knows but the Lord may return, and leave a ble&s;&s;ing behind him,</HI> as in the ca&s;e of the impotent man, recorded, John v 5, 6, 7, 8. I hope Satan does not chain you to your hou&s;es, nor &s;take you down in your fields on the Lord's day; but ye are at liberty, and can wait at the po&s;ts of wi&s;dom's door, if ye will. And when ye come thither, he doth not beat drums at your ears, that ye cannot hear what is &s;aid: there is no force upon you obliging you to apply all you hear to others; ye may apply to your&s;elves what belongs to your &s;tate and condition: and when you go home, you are not fettered in your hou&s;es, where perhaps no re|ligious di&s;cour&s;e is to be heard; but ye may retire to &s;ome &s;eparate place, where ye can meditate, and po&s;e your con&s;cience with pertinent que&s;tions, upon what ye have heard. Ye are not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a dumb devil, that ye cannot get your mouths opened in prayer to God. Ye are not &s;o driven out of your beds to your worldly bu&s;ine&s;s, and from your worldly bu&s;ine&s;s to your beds again; but ye might, if ye would, be&s;tow &s;ome prayers to God upon the ca&s;e of your peri&s;hing &s;ouls. Ye may examine your&s;elves, as to the &s;tate of your &s;ouls, in a &s;olemn manner, as in the pre&s;ence of God; ye may di&s;cern that ye

have no grace, and that ye are lo&s;t and undone without it; and may cry unto God for it. The&s;e things are within the compa&s;s of natural abilities, and may be practi&s;ed where there is no grace. It mu&s;t ag|gravate your guilt, that you will not be at &s;o much pains about the &s;tate and ca&s;e of your precious &s;ouls.

If ye do thus, ye are &s;o far in the road of your duty; and ye are u&s;ing the means, which the Lord is wont to ble&s;s, for men's &s;piritual recovery: ye lay your&s;elves in the way of the great Phy&s;ician; and &s;o it is probable ye may be healed. <HI>Lydia</HI> went, with others, to the place <HI>where prayer was wont to be made;</HI> and <HI>the Lord opened her heart,</HI> Acts xvi. 13, 14. Ye plow and &s;ow, tho' no-body can tell you for certain, that ye will get &s;o much as your &s;eed again: Ye u&s;e means for the recovery of your health, tho' ye are not &s;ure they will &s;ucceed. In the&s;e ca&s;es, probability determines you; and why not in this al&s;o? Importunity, we &s;ee, doe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> very much with men: therefore pray, meditate, de&s;ire help of God; be much at the throne of grace, &s;upplicating for grace; and do not faint. Tho' God regard not you, who, in your pre&s;ent &s;tate, are but one ma&s;s of &s;in; univer&s;ally depraved, and vitiated in all the powers of your &s;oul: yet he may regard his own ordinance. Tho' he re|gards not your prayers, your meditations, &amp;c. yet he may regard prayer, meditation, and the like means of his own appointment, and &s;o ble&s;s them to you. Wherefore, if ye will not do what ye can: ye are not only dead, but you declare your&s;elves unworthy of eternal life.</P>
<P>To conclude, let the &s;aints admire the freedom and power of grace, which came to them in their helple&s;s condition, made their chains fall off, the iron gate to open to them, rai&s;ed the fallen creatures; and brought them out of the &s;tate of &s;in and wrath, wherein they would have lain and peri&s;hed, had they not been mercifully vi&s;ited. Let the natural man be &s;en&s;ible of his utter inability to recover him&s;elf. Know thou art without &s;trength; and can&s;t not come to Chri&s;t, till thou be drawn. Thou art lo&s;t, and can&s;t not help thy&s;elf. This may &s;hake the foundation of thy nopes, who never &s;awe&s;t thy ab&s;olute need of Chri&s;t and his grace; but thinke&s;t to &s;hift for thy&s;elf, by thy civility, morality, drow&s;y wi&s;hes and duties; and by a faith and repentance, which have &s;prung up out of thy natural powers, without the power and efficacy of the grace of Chri&s;t. O be convinced of thy ab&s;olute need of Chri&s;t, and his overcoming grace; believe thy utter inability to recover thy&s;elf: and &s;o thou may&s;t be humbled, &s;haken out of thy &s;elf-confidence, and ly down in du&s;t and a&s;hes, groaning out thy mi&s;er|able ca&s;e before the Lord: A kindly &s;en&s;e of thy natural impotency, the impotency of depraved human nature, would be a &s;tep towards a delivery.</P>

<P>WE proceed now to the &s;tate of grace, the &s;tate of begun recovery of human nature, into which, all that &s;hall partake of eternal happine&s;s, are tran&s;lated, &s;ooner, or later, while in this world. It is the re&s;ult of a gracious change, made upon the&s;e who &s;hall inherit eternal life; which change may be taken up in the&s;e two, (1.) In oppo&s;ition to their natural real &s;tate, the &s;tate of corruption, there is a change made upon them in regeneration; whereby their nature is changed. (2.) In oppo&s;ition to their natural relative &s;tate, the &s;tate of wrath, there is a change made upon them, in their union with the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; by which they are &s;et beyond the reach of con|demnation. The&s;e therefore, namely, regeneration, and union with Chri&s;t, I de&s;ign to handle, as the great and comprehen&s;ive changes on a &s;inner, con&s;tituting him in the &s;tate of grace.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e we have in the text, together with the outward and ordinary means, by which it is brought about. The apo&s;tle here, to excite the &s;aints to the &s;tudy of holine&s;s, and particularly of bro|therly love, put them in mind of their &s;piritual original. He tells them they were born again; and that of incorruptible &s;eed, <HI>the word of God.</HI> This &s;peaks them to be brethren, partakers of the &s;ame new nature; which is the root from which holine&s;s, and particularly bro|therly love, doth &s;pring. We are once &s;inners; we mu&s;t be born again, that we may be &s;aints. The &s;imple word &s;ignifies <HI>to be begotten;</HI> and &s;o it may be read, Matth. xi. 11. <HI>to be conceived,</HI> Matth. i. 20 and <HI>to be born,</HI> Matth ii. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. According, the compound word u&s;ed in the text, may be taken in its full latitude, the la&s;t notion pre&s;uppo&s;ing the two former: and &s;o regeneration is a &s;upernatural real change on the whole man, fitly compared to natural or corporal generation, as will afterward appear. The ordinary means of regeneration called

<HI>the &s;eed,</HI> whereof the new creature is formed, is not corruptible &s;eed.

<HEAD>Of the Nature of Regeneration.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. For the better under&s;tanding of the nature of regeneration, take this along with you in the fir&s;t place. That as there are fal&s;e con|ceptions in nature, &s;o there are al&s;o in grace: and by the&s;e many are deluded, mi&s;taking &s;ome partial changes made upon them, for this great and thorough change. To remove &s;uch mi&s;takes, let the&s;e few things be con&s;idered. (1.) Many call the church their mother, whom God will not own to be his children, Cant. i. 6. <HI>My mother s children (i. e.</HI> fal&s;e brethren) <HI>were angry with me.</HI> All that are baptized are not born again. <HI>Simon</HI> was baptized, yet &s;till <HI>in the gall of bitterne&s;s, and in the bond of iniquity,</HI> Acts viii. 13, 23. Where Chri&s;tianity is the religion of the country, many will be called by the name of Chri&s;t, who have no more of him, but the name: and no wonder, &s;eeing the devil had his goats among Chri&s;t's &s;heep, in the&s;e places, where but few profe&s;&s;ed the Chri&s;tian religion, 1 John ii. 19. <HI>They went out from us, but they were not of us.</HI> (2) Good education is not regeneration. Education may chain up men's lu&s;ts, but cannot change their hearts. A wolf is &s;till a ravenous bea&s;t, though it be in chains. <HI>Joa&s;h</HI> was very devout during the life of his good tutor <HI>Jehoiada;</HI> but afterwards he quickly &s;hewed what &s;pirit he was of, by his &s;udden apo&s;ta&s;y, 2 Chron. xxiv. 2, 17, 18. Good example is of mighty influence to change the outward man; but that change often goes off, when one changes his company; of which the world affords many &s;ad in&s;tances. (3.) A turning from open profanity, to civility and &s;obriety, falls &s;hort of this &s;aving change. Some are, for a while, very loo&s;e, e&s;pecially in their younger years; but at length they reform, and leave their profane <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ur&s;es Here is a change, yet but &s;uch an one, as may be found in them, utterly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of the grace of God and who&s;e righteou&s;ne&s;s is &s;o far from exceeding, that it doth not come up to the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the <HI>Suri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ri&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es.</HI> (4.) One may engage in all the outward duties of religion, and yet not be born again. Tho' lead be ca&s;t into
<PB N="131" REF="045042_0128_101F7E23DF8F6820">
various &s;hapes, it remains &s;till but a ba&s;e metal. Men may e&s;cape the pollutions of the world, and yet be but dogs and &s;wine, 2 Pet. ii 20, 22. All the external acts of religion are within the compa&s; o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> natural abilities. Yea, hypocrites may have the counterfeit of all the graces of the Spirit: for we read of <HI>true holine&s;s,</HI> Eph. iv 23. and <HI>faith unfeigned,</HI> 1 Tim i 5. which &s;hews us, that there is a counterfeit holine&s;s, and a feigned faith. (5.) Men may advance to a great deal of &s;trictne&s;s in their own way of religion; and yet be &s;trangers to the new birth, Acts xxxvi. 5. <HI>After the mo&s;t &s;tricte&s;t &s;ect of our religion, I lived a Phari&s;ee.</HI> Nature has its own un&s;anctified &s;trictne&s;s in religion. The <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> had &s;o much of it, that they looked on Chri&s;t as little better than a mere libertine. A man who&s;e con&s;cience hath been awakened, and who lives under the felt influence of the covenant of works, what will he not do, that is within the compa&s;s of natural abilities? It was a truth, tho' it came out of a helli&s;h mouth, that <HI>&s;kin for &s;kin, all that a man hath will he give for his life,</HI> Job ii. 4. (6.) One may have &s;harp &s;oul-exerci&s;es and pangs, and yet die in the birth. Many have been in pain, that have but as it were brought forth wind. There may be &s;ore pangs and throws of con&s;cience, which turn to nothing at la&s;t. <HI>Pharaoh</HI> and <HI>Simon Magus</HI> had &s;uch convictions, as made them de&s;ire the prayers of others for them. <HI>Judas repented him&s;elf;</HI> and under terrors of con&s;cience, gave back his ill-gotten pieces of &s;ilver. All is not gold that gli&s;ters. Trees may blo&s;&s;om fairly in the &s;pring, on which no fruit is to be found in the harve&s;t: and &s;ome have &s;harp &s;oul-exerci&s;es, which are nothing but foreta&s;tes of hell.</P>
<P>The new birth, however in appearance hopefully begun, may be marred two ways. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Some, like <HI>Zarah,</HI> Gen. xxxviii 28, 29 are brought to the birth, but go back again. They have &s;harp convictions for a while: but the&s;e go off, and they turn as carele&s;s about their &s;alvation, as profane as ever: and u&s;ually wor&s;e than ever, <HI>their la&s;t &s;tate is wor&s;e than their fir&s;t,</HI> Mat. xii. 45. They get awakening grace, but not converting grace; and that goes off by degrees, as the light of the declining day, till it i&s;&s;ue in midnight darkne&s;s. <HI>Secondly</HI> Some like <HI>I&s;hmael,</HI> come forth too &s;oon; they are born before the time of the promi&s;e, Gen xvi. 1, 2. compare Gal. iv. 22. and down|ward. They take up with a mere law-work, and &s;tay not till the time of the promi&s;e of the go&s;pel. They &s;natch at con&s;olation, not waiting till it be given them; and fooli&s;hly draw their comfort <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the law that wounded them. They apply the healing plu&s;ter to them&s;elves, before their wound be &s;ufficiently &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rched.

of the affections, in &s;ouls that are not at all touched with regenerating grace Where there is no grace, there may, notwith&s;tanding, be a flood of tears as in <HI>E&s;au, who found no place of repentance, tho' he &s;ought it carefully with tears,</HI> Heb xii. 17. There may be great fla&s;hes of joy; as in the hearers of the word, repre&s;ented in the parable by the &s;tony ground, who anon with <HI>joy receive it,</HI> Matth. xiii. 20. There may al&s;o be great de&s;ire after good things, and great delight in them too; as in the&s;e hypocrites de&s;cribed, I&s;a lviii. 2. <HI>Yet they &s;eek me daily, and delight to know my ways.&mdash;They take delight in approaching unto God.</HI> See how high they may &s;ometimes &s;tand, who yet fall away, Heb. vi. 4, 5, 6 They may be <HI>enlightned, ta&s;te of the heavenly gift, be partakers of the holy Gho&s;t, ta&s;te the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come</HI> Common operations of the divine Spirit, like a land flood, make a &s;trange turning of things up-&s;ide-down. And when they are over, all runs again in the ordinary channel. All the&s;e things may be, where the &s;anctifying Spirit of Chri&s;t never re&s;ts upon the &s;oul, but the &s;tony heart &s;till remains; and in that ca&s;e, the&s;e affections cannot but <HI>wither becau&s;e they have no root.</HI></P>
<P>But regeneration is a real thorough change, whereby the man is made a new creature, 2 Cor. v. 17. The Lord God makes the creature a new creature, as the gold&s;mith melts down the ve&s;&s;el of di&s;honour and makes it a ve&s;&s;el of honour. Man is, in re&s;pect of his natural &s;tate, altogether disjointed by the fall; every faculty of the &s;oul is, as it were, di&s;locate: in regeneration the Lord loo&s;eth every joint, and &s;ets it right again. Now this change made in regeneration is,</P>
<P N="1">1. A change of qualities or di&s;po&s;itions: it is not a change of the &s;ub&s;tance, but of the qualities of the &s;oul. Vicious qualities are re|moved, and the contrary di&s;po&s;itions are brought in, in their room. <HI>The old man is put off,</HI> Eph. iv. 22. <HI>the n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w man put on,</HI> ver. 24. Man lo&s;t none of the rational faculties of his &s;oul by &s;in; he had an under|&s;tanding &s;till, but it was darkened; he had &s;till a will, but it was contrary to the will of God. So in regeneration there is not a new &s;ub&s;tance created, but new qualities are infu&s;ed; light in&s;tead of dark|ne&s;s, righteou&s;ne&s;s in&s;tead of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is a &s;upernatural change; he that is born again, is born of the Spirit, John iii 5. Great changes may be made by the power of nature, e&s;pecially when a&s;&s;i&s;ted by external revelation. And nature may be &s;o elevated by the common influences of the Spirit, that one may thereby be turned into another man, (as <HI>Soul</HI> was, 1 Sam. x 6.) who yet never becomes a new man. But in regeneration nature it&s;elf is changed, and we become partakers of the divine nature; and this mu&s;t needs be a &s;upernatural change. How can we that are dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins, renew our&s;elves, more than a dead man can rai&s;e him&s;elf out of his grave? Who, but the &s;anctifying Spirit of Chri&s;t, can form Chri&s;t in a &s;oul, changing it into the &s;ame image? Who, but the Spirit of &s;anctification can give the new heart? Well may we &s;ay, when we &s;ee a man thus changed, <HI>This is the finger of God.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="133" REF="045042_0130_101F7E2DC7D3E030">3. It is a change into the likene&s;s of God, 2 Cor iii. 18. <HI>We&mdash; beholding as in a gla&s;s the glory of the Lord, are changed into the &s;ame image.</HI> Every thing that generates, generates its like: the child bears the image of the parent; and they that are born of God, bear God's image. Man a&s;piring to be as God, made him&s;elf like the devil. In his natural &s;tate he re&s;embles the devil, as a child doth the father, John viii 44. <HI>Ye are of your father the devil.</HI> But when this happy change comes, the image of Satan is defaced, and the image of God re&s;tored. Chri&s;t him&s;elf, who <HI>is the brightne&s;s of his Father's glory,</HI> is the pattern, after which the new creature is made, Rom. viii 29. <HI>For whom he did for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">know, he al&s;o did prede&s;tinate to be conformed to the image of his Son</HI> Hence he is &s;aid to be conformed in the regenerate, Gal. iv. 19.</P>
<P N="4">4 It is an univer&s;al change; all things become new, 2 Cor. vi. 17. It is a ble&s;t leaven that leavens the whole lump, the whole &s;pirit, and &s;oul and body. Original &s;in infects the whole man; and regenerating grace, which is the &s;alve, goes as far as the &s;ore. This fruit of the Spirit is in all goodne&s;s; goodne&s;s of the mind, goodne&s;s of the will, goodne&s;s of the affections, goodne&s;s of the whole man One gets not only a new head to know religion, or a new tongue to talk of it; but a new heart to love and embrace it, in the whole of his conver&s;ation. When the Lord opens the &s;luice of grace on the &s;oul's new birth|day, the waters run through the whole man, to purify and make him fruitful. In the&s;e natural changes &s;poken of before, there are, as it were, pieces of new cloth put into an old garment; a new life &s;ewed to an old heart: but the gracious change is a thorough change, a change both of heart and life.</P>
<P N="5">5. Yet it is but an imperfect change. Tho' every part of the man is renewed, there is no part of him perfectly renewed. As an infant has all the parts of a man, but none of them are come to their perfect growth; &s;o regeneration brings a perfection of parts, to be brought forward in the gradual advances of &s;anctification, 1 Pet ii. 2. <HI>As new born babes de&s;ire the &s;incere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby.</HI> Although in regeneration there is a heavenly light let into the mind; yet there is &s;till &s;ome darkne&s;s there: tho' the will is renewed, it is not perfectly renewed; there is &s;till &s;ome of the old inclination to &s;in remaining: and thus it will be till that which is in part be done away, and the light of glory come <HI>Adam</HI> was created at his full &s;tature; but they that are born, mu&s;t have their time to grow up; &s;o the&s;e that are born again, do come forth into the new world of grace, but imperfectly holy; though <HI>Adam,</HI> being created upright, was at the &s;ame time perfectly righteous, without the lea&s;t mixture of &s;inful imperfection</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> Neverthele&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a la&s;ting change, which never goes off. The &s;eed is incorruptible &s;aith the text; and &s;o is the creature that is formed of it.

<P>But to come to particulars.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> In regeneration the mind is &s;avingly enlightned. There is a new light let into the under&s;tanding, &s;o that they who were <HI>&s;ome|times darkne&s;s, are now light in the Lord,</HI> Eph. v 8. The beams of the light of life make their way into the dark dungeon of the heart: then night is over, and the morning-light is come, which will &s;hine more and more unto the perfect day. Now the man is illuminated,</P>
<P N="1">1. In the knowledge of God. He has far other thoughts of God, than ever he had before, Ho&s;. ii. 20. <HI>I will even betrothe thee unto me in faithfulne&s;s, and thou &s;halt know the Lord.</HI> The Spirit of the Lord brings him back to that que&s;tion, <HI>What is God?</HI> And catechi&s;eth him anew upon that grand point, &s;o as he is made to &s;ay, <HI>I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eyes &s;eeth thee,</HI> Job xlii. 5. The &s;potle&s;s purity of God, his exact ju&s;tice, his all-&s;ufficiency, and other glorious perfections revealed in his word, are, by this new light, di&s;covered to the &s;oul, with a plainne&s;s and certainty that doth as far exceed the knowledge it had of the&s;e things before, as ocular demon|&s;tration exceeds common fame. For now he &s;ees what he only heard of before.</P>
<P N="2">2. He is enlightned in the knowledge of &s;in. He hath other thoughts of it, than he was wont to have. Formerly his &s;ight could not pierce thro' the cover Satan laid over it: but now the Spirit of God &s;trips it before him, wipes off the paint and fairding; and he &s;ees it in its native colours, as the wor&s;t of evils: exceeding &s;inful, Rom. vii. 12. O what deformed mon&s;ters do formerly beloved lu&s;ts appear! were they right eyes, he would pluck them out: were they right hands, he would con&s;ent to their cutting off. He &s;ees how offen&s;ive &s;in is to God, how de&s;tructive it is to the &s;oul; and calls him&s;elf fool, for fighting &s;o long again&s;t the Lord, and harbouring that de&s;troyer as a bo&s;om friend.</P>

He is enlightned in the knowledge of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, 1 Cor. i. 23, 24. <HI>But we preach Chri&s;t crucified, unto the Jews a &s;tumbling block, and unto the Greeks fooli&s;hne&s;s: but unto them that are called, both Jews and Greeks, Chri&s;t, the power of God, and the wi&s;dom of God.</HI> The truth is, unregenerate men, tho' capable of preaching Chri&s;t, have not (properly &s;peaking) the knowledge of him, but only an opinion, a good opinion of him; as one has of many controverted points of doctrine, wherein he is far from certainty. As when ye meet with a &s;tranger upon the road, he behaving him&s;elf di&s;creetly, ye conceive a good opinion of him; and therefore willingly conver&s;e with him; but yet ye will not commit your money to him; becau&s;e, tho' you have a good opinion of the man, he is a &s;tranger to you, ye do not know him. So many, they think well of Chri&s;t; but they will never commit them&s;elves to him; &s;eeing they know him not. But &s;aving illumination carries the &s;oul beyond opinion, to the certain knowledge of Chri&s;t and his excellency, 1 The&s;&s;. i. 5. <HI>For our go&s;pel came not unto you in word only, but al&s;o in power, and in the holy Gho&s;t, and in much a&s;&s;urance.</HI> The light of grace thus di&s;covers the &s;uitablene&s;s of the my&s;tery of Chri&s;t, to the divine perfections, and to the &s;inner's ca&s;e. Hence the regenerate admire the glorious plan of &s;alvation through Chri&s;t crucified, lay their whole weight upon it, and heartily acquie&s;ce therein: for whatever he be to others, he is to them <HI>Chri&s;t the power of God, and the wi&s;dom of God.</HI> But unrenewed men, not &s;eeing this, are offended in him; they will not venture their &s;ouls in that bottom, but betake them&s;elves to the broken boards of their own righteou&s;|ne&s;s. The &s;ame light convincingly di&s;covers a &s;uperlative worth, a tran&s;cendant glory and excellency in Chri&s;t; which darken all created excellencies, as the ri&s;ing &s;un makes the &s;tars to hide their heads: and &s;o it engages <HI>the merchant-man to &s;ell all that he hath, to buy the one pearl of great price,</HI> Matth. xiii. 45, 46. makes the &s;oul well content, to take Chri&s;t for all, and in&s;tead of all. Even as an un&s;kilful merchant, to whom one offereth a pearl of great price, for all his petty wares, dares not venture on the bargain; for tho' he thinks, that one pearl may be more worth than all he has, yet he is not &s;ure of it: but when a jeweller comes to him, and a&s;&s;ures him, it is worth double all his wares; he then greedily embraceth the bargain, and chearfully parts with all that he has for that pearl. <HI>Finally,</HI> This illumination in the knowledge of Chri&s;t, convincingly di&s;covereth to men a fulne&s;s in him, &s;ufficient for the &s;upply of all their wants; enough to &s;atisfy the boundle&s;s de&s;ires of an immortal &s;oul They are per&s;uaded &s;uch ful|ne&s;s is in him, and that in order to be communicate: they depend upon it, as a certain truth; and therefore their &s;ouls take up their eternal re&s;t in him.</P>

thing; even as heaven appeared before, while the &s;oul was immer&s;ed in the earth. Grace brings a man into a new world; while this world is reputed but a &s;tage of vanity, an howling wilderne&s;s, a valley of tears. God hath hung the &s;ign of vanity at the door of all created enjoyments; yet how do men throng into the hou&s;e, calling and look|ing for &s;omewhat that is &s;atisfying; even after it has been a thou&s;and times told them, there is no &s;uch thing in it, it is not to be got there, I&s;a. lvi. 10. <HI>Thou art wearied in the greatne&s;s of thy ways; yet &s;aid&s;t thou not, There is no hope.</HI> Why are men &s;o fooli&s;h? The truth of the matter lies here, they do not &s;ee by the light of grace, they do not &s;piritually di&s;cern, that &s;ign of vanity They have often indeed made a rational di&s;covery of it: but can that truly wean the heart from the world? Nay, no more than painted fire can burn off the pri&s;oner's bands. But the light of grace is the light of life, powerful and efficacious</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> (To &s;um up all in one word) In regenerationthe mind is enlightned in the knowledge of &s;piritual things, 1 John ii 20 <HI>Ye have an unction from the holy One</HI> (that is, from Je&s;us Chri&s;t, Rev. iii 18. It is an allu&s;ion to the &s;anctuary, whence the holy oil was brought to anoint the prie&s;ts) <HI>and ye know all things,</HI> viz nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation. Tho' men be not book-learned, if they be born again, they are Spirit-learned; for all &s;uch are taught of God, John vi. 45. The Spirit of regeneration teacheth them what they knew not before; and what they did know, as by the ear only, he teacheth them over again as by the eye. The light of grace is an overcoming light, determining men to a&s;&s;ent to divine truths on the mere te&s;timony of God. It is no ea&s;y thing for the mind of man, to acquie&s;ce in divine revelation. Many pretend great re&s;pect to the &s;criptures, whom, neverthele&s;s, the clear &s;cripture-te&s;timony will not divorce from their pre-conceived opinions. But this illumination will make men's minds run, as captives, after Chri&s;t's chariot-wheels; which, for their part, &s;hall be allowed to drive over, and ca&s;t down their own <HI>imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth it&s;elf again&s;t the knowledge of God.</HI> 2 Cor. x 5. It will make them <HI>receive the kingdom of God as a little child,</HI> Mark x. 15. who thinks he has &s;ufficient ground to believe any thing, if his father do but &s;ay it is &s;o.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The <HI>will</HI> is renewed. The Lord takes away the &s;tony heart, and gives a heart of fle&s;h, Ezek. xxxvi 26. And &s;o, of &s;tones rai&s;eth up children to <HI>Abraham.</HI> Regenerating grace is powerful and efficacious, and gives the <HI>will</HI> a new &s;et It does not indeed force it: but &s;weetly, yet powerfully draws it, &s;o that <HI>his people are willing in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ay of his power,</HI> P&s;al. cx. 3. There is heavenly oratory in the Mediator's lips, to per&s;uade &s;inners, P&s;al. xlv. 2 <HI>Grace is poured into thy lips.</HI> There are cords of a man, and bands of love in his hands, to draw them after him, Ho&s; xi. 4. Love makes a net for elect &s;ouls, which will infallibly catch them, and hale them to land. The cords of Chri&s;t's love are &s;trong cords: and they need to be &s;o; for every
<PB N="137" REF="045042_0134_101F7E3AA29BCD60">
&s;inner is heavier than a mountain of bra&s;s: and Satan, together with the heart it&s;elf, draw the contrary way But love is &s;trong as death; and the Lord's love to the &s;oul he died for, is &s;tronge&s;t love; which acts &s;o powerfully, that it mu&s;t come off victorious.</P>
<P N="1">I. The <HI>will</HI> is cured of its utter inability to will what is good. While the opening of the pri&s;on to them that are bound is proclaimed in the go&s;pel: The Spirit of God comes to the pri&s;on door, opens it, goe to the pri&s;oner; and by the power of his grace makes his chains fall off; breaks the bond of iniquity, wherewith he was held in &s;in, &s;o as he could neither will nor do any thing truly good; brings him forth into a large place, <HI>Working in him both to will and to do, of his good plea&s;ure,</HI> Phil ii. 13. Then it is that the &s;oul, that was fixed to the earth, can move heavenward; the withered hand is re&s;tored, and can be &s;tretched out.</P>
<P N="2">2. There is wrought in the <HI>will</HI> a fixed aver&s;ion to evil. In re|generation, a man gets a <HI>new &s;pirit put within him,</HI> Ezek. xxxvi. 26. and that <HI>&s;pirit lu&s;teth again&s;t the fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;h,</HI> Gal. v. 17. The &s;weet mor&s;el of &s;in, &s;o greedily &s;wallowed down, he now lothes, and would fain be rid of it; even as willingly as one, that had drunk a cup of poi&s;on, would throw it up again. When the &s;pring is &s;topt, the mud lies in the well unmoved: but when once the &s;pring is cleared, the waters &s;pringing up, will work the mud away by degrees Even &s;o, while a man continues in an unregenerate &s;tate, &s;in lies at ea&s;e in the heart: but as &s;oon as the Lord &s;trikes the rocky heart, with the rod of his &s;trength in the day of conver&s;ion, grace is in <HI>him a well of water, &s;pringing up into everla&s;ting life,</HI> John iv. working away natural cor|ruption, and gradually purifying the heart, Acts xv. 9. The renewed <HI>will</HI> ri&s;eth up again&s;t &s;in, &s;trikes at the root thereof, and the branches too. Lu&s;ts are now grievous, and the &s;oul endeavours to &s;tarve them: the corrupt nature is the &s;ource of all evil, and therefore the &s;oul will be often laying it before the great Phy&s;ician. O what &s;orrow, &s;hame and &s;elf-loathing fill the heart, in the day that grace makes its triumph|ant entrance into it? For now the madman is come to him&s;elf, and the remembrance of his follies cannot but cut him to the heart.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> The <HI>will</HI> is endued with an inclination, bent, and propen&s;ity to good In its depraved &s;tate, it lay quite another way; being prone and bent to evil only: but now, by a pull of the omnipotent, all-conquering arm, it is drawn from evil to good, and gets another &s;et. And as the former &s;et was natural; &s;o this is natural too, in re&s;pect of the new nature given in regeneration which has its own holy lu&s;tings, as well as the corrupt old nature hath its &s;inful lu&s;tings, Gal. v. 17. The <HI>will,</HI> as renewed, inclines and points towards God and godline&s;s. When God made man, his <HI>will,</HI> in re&s;pect of its in|tention, was directed towards God, as his chief end; in re&s;pect of its choice, it pointed towards that which God willed. When man un|made him&s;elf, his <HI>will</HI> was framed into the very rever&s;e hereof: he made him&s;elf his chief end, and his own <HI>will</HI> his law. But when man
<PB N="138" REF="045042_0135_101F7E3F2631C560">
is new made, in regeneration, grace rectifies this di&s;order in &s;ome mea&s;ure, tho' not perfectly indeed; becau&s;e we are but renewed in part, while in this world. It brings back the &s;inner, out of him&s;elf, to God as his chief end, truly, tho' not perfectly, P&s;al. lxxiii. 25. <HI>Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I de&s;ire be&s;ides thee.</HI> Philip. i. 21. <HI>For to me to live is Chri&s;t.</HI> It makes him to deny him&s;elf, and whatever way he turns, to point habitually towards God; who is the center of the gracious &s;oul, its home, its dwelling-place in all generations, P&s;al. xc. 1. By regenerating grace, the <HI>will</HI> is framed into a conformity to the <HI>will</HI> of God. It is con|formed to his preceptive <HI>will,</HI> being endued with holy inclinations, agreeable to every one of his commands. The whole law is impre&s;&s;ed on the gracious &s;oul: every part of it is written over on the renewed heart. And altho' remaining corruption makes &s;uch blots in the writing, that oft-times the man him&s;elf cannot read it: yet he that wrote it can read it at all times; it is never quite blotted out, nor can be. What he has written, he has written, it &s;hall &s;tand: <HI>For this is the covenant, &mdash; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts,</HI> Heb. viii. 10. And it is a covenant of &s;alt, a perpetual covenant. It is al&s;o conformed to his providential <HI>will;</HI> &s;o that the man will no more be ma&s;ter of his own proce&s;s; nor carve out his lot for him&s;elf. He learns to &s;ay, from his heart, <HI>The will of the Lord be done,&mdash;he &s;hall chu&s;e our inheritance for us,</HI> P&s;al. xlvii. 4. Thus the <HI>will</HI> is di&s;po&s;ed to fall in with tho&s;e things, which, in its depraved &s;tate, it could never be reconciled to.</P>
<P>Particularly, (1.) The Lord is reconciled to the covenant of peace. The Lord God promi&s;eth a covenant of peace to &s;inners; a covenant which he him&s;elf hath framed, and regi&s;trated in the Bible: but they are not plea&s;ed with it; nay, an unrenewed heart cannot be plea&s;ed with it. Were it put into their hands, to frame it according to their mind; they would blot many things out of it, which God has put in; and put in many things, God has kept out. But the renewed heart is entirely &s;atisfied with the covenant, 2 Sam. xxiii. 5. <HI>He hath made with me an everla&s;ting covenant, ordered in all things and &s;ure; this is all my &s;alvation, and all my de&s;ire.</HI> Tho' the covenant could not be brought down to their depraved <HI>will,</HI> their <HI>will</HI> is, by grace, brought up to the covenant; they are well-plea&s;ed with it: there is nothing in it they would have out; nor is any thing left out of it, which they would have in. (2.) Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>will</HI> is di&s;po&s;ed to receive Chri&s;t Je&s;us the Lord. The &s;oul is content to &s;ubmit to him. Regenerating grace undermines, and brings down the tow'ring imaginations of the heart, rai&s;ed up again&s;t its rightful lord: it breaks the iron &s;inew, which kept the &s;inner from bowing to him, and di&s;po&s;ed him to be no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>&s;tiff|necked, but to yield to him&s;elf.</HI> He is willing to take on the yoke of Chri&s;t's commands, to take up the cro&s;s and to follow h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> He is content to take Chri&s;t on any terms, P&s;al. xc. 3. <HI>Thy people &s;hall be willing in the day of thy power.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="045042_0136_101F7E422C1965F0">Now, the <HI>mind</HI> being &s;avingly enlightened, and the <HI>will</HI> renewed; the &s;inner is thereby determined and enabled to an&s;wer the go&s;pel-call. So the main work in regeneration is done; the fort of the heart is taken: there is room made for the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in the inner|mo&s;t parts of the &s;oul; the outer-door of the <HI>will</HI> being now opened to him, as well as the inner-door of the <HI>under&s;tanding.</HI> In one word, Chri&s;t is pa&s;&s;ively received into the heart; he is come into the &s;oul by his quickning &s;pirit, whereby &s;piritual life is given to the man, who in him&s;elf was dead to &s;in.

<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> In regeneration; there is a happy change made on the affections; they are both rectified and regulated.</P>
<P N="1">1. This change rectifies the affections, placing them on &s;uitable objects, 2 The&s;&s;. iii. 5. <HI>The Lord direct your hearts into the love of God.</HI> The regenerate man's de&s;ires are rectified; they are &s;et on God him&s;elf, and the things above. He who before, cried with the world, <HI>Who will &s;hew us any good?</HI> he changes his note, and &s;ays, <HI>Lord lift up the light of thy countenance upon us,</HI> P&s;al. iv. Sometimes he &s;aw no beauty in Chri&s;t, for which he was to be de&s;ired; but now he is all de&s;ires, he is <HI>altogether lovely,</HI> Cant. v. 16.

He de&s;ires to be holy, as well as to be happy; and rather to be gracious than great. His hopes, which before were low, and &s;taked down to things on earth, are now rai&s;ed, and &s;et on the glory which is to be revealed. He entertains the hope of eternal life, founded on the word of promi&s;e, Tit. i. 2. <HI>Which hope</HI> he has, <HI>as an anchor of the &s;oul,</HI> fixing the heart under trials, Heb. vi. 18.

are called, 1 Pet. i. 10. He loves God for him&s;elf, and what is God's, for his &s;ake. Yea, as being a child of God, he loves his own enemies. His heavenly Father is compa&s;&s;ionate and benevolent: he maketh his &s;un to ri&s;e on the evil and the good, <HI>and &s;endeth rain on the ju&s;t, and on the unju&s;t:</HI> and therefore he is in the like manner di&s;po&s;ed, Matth. v. 44, 45.

Who &s;hall deliver me from the body of this death?</HI> His joys and delights are in God the Lord, in the light of his countenance, in his law, and in his people; becau&s;e they are like him. Sin is what he chiefly fears; it is a fountain of &s;orrow to him now, tho' formerly a &s;pring of plea&s;ure.</P>
<P N="2">2. It regulates the affections placed on &s;uitable objects. Our af|fections, when placed on the creature, are naturally exorbitant: when we joy in it, we are apt to over-joy; and when we &s;orrow, we are ready to &s;orrow over-much: but grace bridles the&s;e affections, clips their wings, and keeps them within bounds, that they overflow not at all their banks. It makes a man <HI>hate his father and mother, and wife and children,&mdash;yea, and his own life al&s;o,</HI> comparatively; that is, to love them le&s;s than he loves God, Luke xiv. 26. It al&s;o &s;anctifies lawful affections; bringing them forth from right principles, and directing them to right ends. There may be unholy de&s;ires after Chri&s;t and his grace; as when men de&s;ire Chri&s;t, not from any love to him, but merely out of love to them&s;elves. <HI>Give us of your oil,</HI> &s;aid the fooli&s;h virgins, <HI>for our lamps are gone out,</HI> Matth. xxv. 8. There may be an un&s;anctified &s;orrow for &s;in; as when one &s;orroweth for it, not becau&s;e it is di&s;plea&s;ing to God, but, only becau&s;e of the wrath annexed to it, as did <HI>Pharaoh, Judas,</HI> and others. So a man may love his father and mother, from more natural principles, without any re&s;pect to the command of God binding him thereto. But grace &s;anctifies the affections in &s;uch ca&s;es, making them to run in a new channel of love to God, re&s;pect to his commands, and regard to his glory. Again, grace &s;crews up the affections where they are too low: It gives the chief &s;eat in them to God: and pulls down all other rivals, whether per&s;ons or things, making them ly at his feet, P&s;al. lxxiii. 25. <HI>Whom have I in heaven, but thee? And there is none upon earth, that I de&s;ire be&s;ide thee.</HI> He is loved for him&s;elf: and other per&s;ons or things, for his &s;ake. What is lovely in them, to the re|newed heart, is &s;ome ray of the divine goodne&s;s appearing in them: for unto gracious &s;ouls they &s;hine only by borrowed light. This ac|counts for the &s;aints loving all men, and yet hating tho&s;e that hate God, and contemning the wicked as vile per&s;ons They h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e and contemn them for their wickedne&s;s: there is nothing of God in that, and therefore nothing lovely or honourable in it: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ut they love them for their commendable qualities, or perfections, whether natural or moral; becau&s;e, in whom&s;oever the&s;e are, they are from God, and
<PB N="141" REF="045042_0138_101F7E4BD2EABA48">
can be traced to him as their fountain. <HI>Finally,</HI> Regenerating grace &s;ets the affections &s;o firmly on God, that the man is di&s;po&s;ed, at God's command, to quit his hold of every thing el&s;e, in order to keep his hold of Chri&s;t; to <HI>hate father and mother,</HI> in compari&s;on with Chri&s;t, Luke xiv 20. It makes even lawful enjoyments like <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI>'s mantle, to hang loo&s;e about a man; that he may quit them when he is in hazard to be en&s;nared by holding them.</P>
<P>If the &s;tream of our affections was never thus turned; we are, doubtle&s;s, going down the &s;tream into the pit. If <HI>the lu&s;t of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ye, the lu&s;t of the fle&s;h, and the pride of life,</HI> have the throne in our hearts, which &s;hould be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Father, Son, and holy Gho&s;t; if we never had &s;o much love to God, as to our&s;elves; if &s;in has been &s;omewhat bitter to us, but never &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ter as &s;uffering, never &s;o bitter as the pain of being weaned from it: truly we are &s;trangers to this &s;aving change For grace turns the affections up&s;ide-down, when|ever it comes into the heart.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> The <HI>con&s;cience</HI> is renewed. Now, that a new light is &s;et up in the &s;oul in regeneration; <HI>con&s;cience</HI> is enlightned&punc; in&s;tructed, and informed That <HI>candle of the Lord,</HI> (Prov xx. 27) is now &s;nuffed and brightned; &s;o as it &s;hines, and &s;ends forth its light into the mo&s;t retired corners of the heart; di&s;covering &s;ins which the &s;oul was not aware of before: and, in a &s;pecial manner, di&s;covering the corruption or depravity of nature, that &s;eed and &s;pawn whence all actual &s;ins proceed This produces the new complaint, Rom vii 24. <HI>O wretched man that I am! who &s;hall deliver m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> from the body of this death?</HI> That con&s;cience, which lay &s;leeping in the man's bo&s;om before, is now awakened, and makes its voice to be heard through the whole &s;oul: and therefore there is no more re&s;t for him in the &s;luggard's bed; he mu&s;t get up and be doing, ari&s;e, <HI>ha&s;te and e&s;cape for his life.</HI> It powerfully incites to obedience; even in the mo&s;t &s;piritual acts, which lay not within the view of the natural con&s;cience; and powerfully re&s;trains from &s;in, even from the&s;e &s;ins which do not ly open to the ob&s;ervation of the world. It urgeth the &s;overeign authority of God, to which the heart is now reconciled and which it willingly acknow|ledges: and &s;o it engageth the man to his duty, whatever be the hazard from the world; for it fills the heart &s;o with the fear of God, that the force of the fear of man is broken. This hath engaged many to <HI>put their life&punc; in their hand,</HI> and follow the cau&s;e of religion they once contemned, and re&s;olutely walk in the path they formerly abhorred, Gal. i. 23 <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e which per&s;ecuted us in &s;in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> pa&s;t, now preacheth the faith which one&punc; he de&s;troyed.</HI> Guilt now makes the con&s;cience to &s;mart It hath bitter remor&s;e for &s;ins pa&s;t, which fills the &s;oul with anxiety, &s;orrow and &s;elf loathing. And every new reflexion on the&s;e &s;ins, is apt to affect, and make its wounds breed afre&s;h with regret. It is made tender, in point of &s;in and duty, for the time to come; being once burnt, it dreads the fire; and f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r to break the hedge, where it was formerly bit by the &s;erpent. <HI>Totally</HI>&punc; The renewed con&s;cience
<PB N="142" REF="045042_0139_101F7E4F15125920">
drives the &s;inner to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as the only phy&s;ician that can draw out the &s;ting of guilt; and who&s;e blood alone can <HI>purge the con&s;cience from dead works,</HI> Heb. ix. 14. refu&s;ing all ea&s;e offered to it from any other hand. And this is an evidence, that the con&s;cience is not only fired, as it may be in an unregenerate &s;tate; but oiled al&s;o with regenerating grace.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> As the <HI>Memory</HI> wanted not its &s;hare of depravity, it is al&s;o bettered by regenerating grace. The <HI>memory</HI> is weakned with re|&s;pect to tho&s;e things that are not worth their room therein; and men are taught to forget injuries, and drop their re&s;entments, Mat. v. 44, 45. <HI>Do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which de&s;pitefully u&s;e you,&mdash;That ye may be (i. e.</HI> appear to be) <HI>the children of your Father which is in heaven.</HI> It is &s;trengthned for &s;piritual things. We have <HI>Solomon</HI>'s receipt for an ill memory, Prov. iii. 1. <HI>My &s;on,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>forget not my law.</HI> But how &s;hall it be kept in mind? <HI>Let thine heart keep my commandments.</HI> Grace makes a heart-memory, even where there is no good head-memory, P&s;al. cxix. 11. <HI>Thy word have I hid in mine heart.</HI> The heart truly touched with the powerful &s;weetne&s;s of truth, will help the memory to retain what is &s;o reli&s;hed. Did divine truths make deeper impre&s;&s;ions on our hearts, they would thereby impre&s;s them&s;elves with more force on our memories, P&s;al. cxix. 93. <HI>I will never forget thy precepts, for with them thou ha&s;t quickned me.</HI> Grace &s;anctifies the memory. Many have large, but un&s;anctified memories; which &s;erve only to gather knowledge, whereby to aggra|vate their condemnation; but the renewed memory &s;erves to <HI>remem|ber his commandments to do them,</HI> P&s;al. ciii. 18. It is a &s;acred &s;tore|hou&s;e, from whence a Chri&s;tian is furni&s;hed in his way to <HI>Zion</HI>: for faith and hope are often &s;upplied out of it, in a dark hour. It is the &s;tore-hou&s;e of former experiences; and the&s;e are the believer's way-marks, by noticing of which he comes to know where he is, even in a dark time, P&s;al. xlii 6. <HI>O my God, my &s;oul is ca&s;t down within me: therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan,</HI> &amp;c. It al&s;o helps the &s;oul to godly &s;orrow and &s;elf-loathing, pre&s;enting old guilt anew before the con&s;cience: and making it bleed afre&s;h, tho' the &s;in be already pardoned, P&s;al. xxv. 7. <HI>Remember not the &s;ins of my youth.</HI> And where unpardoned guilt is lying on the &s;leeping con&s;cience, it is often employed to bring in a word, which in a moment &s;ets the whole &s;oul a&s;&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">: as when <HI>Peter remembered the words of Je&s;us,&mdash;be went out and wept bitterly,</HI> Matth. xxvi. 75. The word of God laid up in a &s;anctified memory, &s;erves a man to re&s;i&s;t temptations, puts the &s;word in his hand again&s;t the &s;piritual enemies, and is a light to direct his &s;teps in the way of religion and righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly,</HI> There is a change made on the <HI>Body,</HI> and the members thereof, in re&s;pect of their u&s;e: they are con&s;ecrated to the Lord. <HI>Even the Body is&mdash;for the Lord,</HI> 1 Cor. vi. 13. It is the temple of the holy Gho&s;t, ver. 19. The members thereof, that were formerly in|&s;truments of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s unto &s;in, become in&s;truments of righte|ou&s;ne&s;s
<PB N="143" REF="045042_0140_101F7E53EDAC4A90">
unto God, Rom. vi. 13. Servants to righteou&s;ne&s;s unto holi|ne&s;s, ver. 19. The eye that conveyed &s;inful imaginations into the heart, is under a covenant, Job xxxi. to do &s;o no more; but to &s;erve the &s;oul in viewing the works, and reading the word of God. The ear that had often been death's porter to let in &s;in, is turned to be the gate of life, by which the word of life enters the &s;oul. The tongue that &s;et on fire the whole cour&s;e of nature, is re&s;tored to the office it was de&s;igned for by the Creator; namely, to be an in&s;trument of glorifying him, and &s;etting forth his prai&s;e. In a word, the whole man is for God, in &s;oul and body, which by this ble&s;&s;ed change are made his.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> This gracious change &s;hines forth in the conver&s;ation. Even the outward man is renewed A new heart makes newne&s;s of life. When the King's daughter is all glorious within, her cloathing is of wrought gold, P&s;al. xlv. 13. The &s;ingle eye makes the whole body full of light, Matth. vi. 22. This change will appear in every part of one's conver&s;ation, particularly in the&s;e following things.</P>
<P N="1">I. In the change of his company. Tho' &s;ometime he de&s;pi&s;ed the company of the &s;aints, now they are the excellent in whom is all his delight, P&s;al. xvi. 3. <HI>I am a companion of all that fear thee,</HI> &s;aith the royal P&s;almi&s;t, P&s;al. cxix. 63. A renewed man joins him&s;elf with the &s;aints: for he and they are like minded, in that which is their main work and bu&s;ine&s;s; they have all one new nature; they are travelling to <HI>Immanuel</HI>'s land, and conver&s;e together in the language of <HI>Canaan.</HI> In vain do men pretend to religion, while ungodly company is their choice; for <HI>a companions of fools &s;hall be de&s;troyed,</HI> Prov. xiii. 20. Religion will make a man &s;hy of throwing him&s;elf into an ungodly family, or any unnece&s;&s;ary familiarity with wicked men; as one that is clean, will beware of going into an infected hou&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. In his relative capacity, he will be a new man. Grace makes men gracious in their &s;everal relations, and natively leads them to the con&s;cientious performance of relative duties. It does not only make good men, and good women; but makes good &s;ubjects, good hu&s;|bands, good wives, children, &s;ervants, and in a word, good relatives in the church, common-wealth, and family. It is a ju&s;t exception made again&s;t the religion of many; namely, that they are bad rela|tives, they are ill hu&s;bands, wives, ma&s;ters, &s;ervants, &amp;c. How will we prove our&s;elves to be new creatures, if we be &s;till ju&s;t &s;uch as we were before, in our &s;everal relations, 2 Cor. v. 17. <HI>Therefore if any man be in Chri&s;t, he is a new creature: old things are pa&s;&s;ed away; behold all things are become new.</HI> Real godline&s;s will gain a te&s;timony to a man, from the con&s;ciences of his neare&s;t relations, tho' they know more of his &s;inful infirmities, than others do; as we &s;ee in that ca&s;e. 2 Kings iv. 2. <HI>Thy &s;ervant, my hu&s;band, is dead, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> knowe&s;t that thy &s;ervant did fear the Lord.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. In the way of his following his worldly bu&s;ine&s;s, there is a great change. It appears to be no more his all, as &s;ome time it was. Tho'
<PB N="144" REF="045042_0141_101F7E56023A5FA0">
&s;aints apply them&s;elves to worldly bu&s;ine&s;s, as well as others; yet their hearts are not &s;wallowed up in it. It is evident they are carry|ing on a trade with heaven, as well as a trade with earth, Philip. iii 20. <HI>For our conver&s;ation is in heaven.</HI> And they go about their employ|ment in the world as a duty laid upon them by the Lord of all; doing their lawful bu&s;ine&s;s, as the will of God, Eph vi. 7. working, becau&s;e he has &s;aid, <HI>Thou &s;halt not &s;teal.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. They have a &s;pecial concern for the advancement of the king|dom of Chri&s;t in the world: they e&s;pou&s;e the intere&s;ts of religion, and <HI>prefer Jeru&s;alem above their chief joy,</HI> P&s;al. cxxxvii 6. How privately &s;oever they live, grace makes them of a public &s;pirit, which will concern it&s;elf in the ark and work of God; in the go&s;pel of God; and in the people of God; even the&s;e of them whom they never &s;aw in the face. As children of God, they naturally care for the&s;e things. They have a new and unwonted concern for the &s;piritual good of others. And no &s;ooner do they ta&s;te of the power of grace them&s;elves, but they are inclined to &s;et up to be agents for Chri&s;t and holine&s;s, in this world; as appears in the ca&s;e of the woman of <HI>Samaria,</HI> who, when Chri&s;t had manife&s;ted him&s;elf to her, <HI>went her way into the city, and &s;aith unto the men, Come, &s;ee a man which told me all things that ever I did! Is not this the Chri&s;t?</HI> John iv. 28, 29. They have &s;een and felt the evil of &s;in, and therefore pity, the world lying in wicked|ne&s;s. They would fain pluck the brands out of the fire, remembring that they them&s;elves were plucked out of it. They will labour to commend religion to others, both by word and example; and rather deny them&s;elves their liberty in indifferent things, than by the un|charitable u&s;e of it, de&s;troy others, 1 Cor. viii. 13 <HI>Wherefore, if m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">at make my brother to offend, I will eat no fle&s;h while the world &s;tandeth, le&s;t I make my brother to offend</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. In their u&s;e of lawful comforts, there is a great change They re&s;t not in them, as their end; but u&s;e them, as means to help them in their way. They draw their &s;atisfaction from the higher &s;prings, even while the lower &s;prings are running. Thus <HI>Hannah</HI> having obtained a &s;on, rejoiced not &s;o much in the gift, as in the giver, 1 Sam. ii. 1 <HI>And Hann<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h prayed, and &s;aid, My heart rejoiceth in the Lord.</HI> Yea, when the comforts of life are gone, they can &s;ub&s;i&s;t without them, and <HI>rejoice in the Lord, altho' the fig-tree do not blo&s;&s;om,</HI> Hab. iii. 17, 18. Grace teacheth to u&s;e the conveniences of a pre&s;ent life pa&s;&s;ingly; and to &s;hew a holy moderation in all things. The heart, which formerly immer&s;ed it&s;elf in the&s;e things without fear, is now &s;hy of being over-much plea&s;ed with them; and being apprehen&s;ive of danger, u&s;es them warily: as the dogs of <HI>Eg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> run while they lap their water out of the river <HI>Nile,</HI> for fear of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> that are in it.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> This change &s;hines forth in the man's performance of re|ligions duties. He who lived in the neglect of them, will do &s;o no more, if once the grace of God enter into his heart. If a man be new-born, he will de&s;ire the &s;incere milk of the word; 1 Pet ii 2.

<P N="2">II. I come to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> generation, a being born again. It is &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> of the re&s;emblance betwixt natu|ral and &s;piritual generation, which he in the following pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">iculars.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Natural generation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y&s;terie is thing: and &s;o is &s;piritual generation.

A new light is let into the <HI>mind,</HI> and the <HI>will</HI> is renowed; but how that light is conveyed thither, how the <HI>will</HI> is fettered with cords of love, and how the rebel is made a willing captive, we can no more tell, than we can tell, <HI>how the bones do grow in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of her that is with child,</HI> Eccle&s;. xi 5. As a man hears the &s;ound of the wind, and finds it &s;tirring; but knows not where i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gins, and where it ends; &s;o is every one that is born of the &s;pirits <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> finds the change that is made upon him, but how it is produced, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> not. One thing he may know, that whereas he was blind, now he &s;eeth: but the &s;eed of grace doth <HI>&s;pring and grow up, he knoweth not how,</HI> Mark iv. 26, 27.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> In both, the creature comes to a being, it had not before. The child is not, till he be generate; and a man has no gracious being, no being in grace, till he be regenerate. Regeneration is not &s;o much the curing of a &s;ick man, as <HI>the quickning of a dead man,</HI> Eph. ii. 1, 5. Man in his depraved &s;tate i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a mere non-entity in grace: and is brought into a new being, by the power of him, <HI>who calleth things that be not, as though they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">;</HI> being <HI>created in Je&s;us Chri&s;t unto good works,</HI> Eph. ii. 10.

<P><PB N="146" REF="045042_0143_101F7E5D98600168"><HI>Thirdly,</HI> As the child is merely pa&s;&s;ive in generation, &s;o is the child of God in regeneration. The one contributes nothing to its own generation; neither does the other contribute any thing, by way of efficiency, to its own regeneration: for tho' a man may lay him&s;elf down at the pool: yet he hath no hand in moving of the water, n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> efficacy in performing of the cure. One is born the child of a king, another the child of a beggar: the child has no hand at all in this difference. God leaves &s;ome in their depraved &s;tate; others he brings into a &s;tate of grace or regeneracy. If thou be thus honoured, no thanks to thee; for <HI>who maketh thee to differ from another?</HI> 1 Cor. iv. 7.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> There is a wonderful contexture of parts in both births. Admirable is the &s;tructure of man's body, in which there is &s;uch a variety of organs: nothing wanting, nothing &s;uperfluous. The P&s;almi&s;t con&s;idering his own body, looks on it as a piece of marvellous work: <HI>I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> fearfully and wonderfully made,</HI> &s;aith he, P&s;al. cxxxix. 14. <HI>and curiou&s;ly wrought in the lower parts of the earth,</HI> ver. 15. That is, in the womb, where I know not how the bones do grow, more than I know what is a-doing in the lowe&s;t parts of the earth. In natural generation, we are curiou&s;ly wrought, as a piece of needle-work; as the word imports: even &s;o it is in regeneration, P&s;al. xlv. 14. <HI>She &s;hall be brought unto the King, in raiment of needle-work, raiment curiou&s;ly wrought.</HI> It is the &s;ame word in both texts. And what that raiment is, the Apo&s;tle tells us, Eph. iv. 24. It is <HI>the new man, which, after God, is created in righteou&s;ne&s;s and true h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">line&s;s.</HI> That is the raiment, he &s;aith, in the &s;ame place, we mu&s;t <HI>put on;</HI> not excluding the im|puted righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t. Both are curiou&s;ly wrought, as ma&s;ter-pieces of the manifold wi&s;dom of God. O the wonderful con|texture of graces in the new creature! O glorious creature, new-made, after the image of God! It is grace for grace in Chri&s;t, which makes up the new man, John i 16. Even as in bodily generation, the child has member for member in the parent; has every member the parent has, in a certain proportion.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> All this, in both ca&s;es, hath its ri&s;e from that which is in it&s;elf very &s;mall and incon&s;iderable. O the power of God, in making &s;uch a creature of the corruptible &s;eed! and much more in bringing forth the new creature from &s;o &s;mall beginnings: it is as <HI>the little cloud like a man's hand,</HI> which &s;pread till heaven <HI>was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain,</HI> 1 Kings xiii 44, 45. A man gets a word at a &s;ermon, which hundreds be&s;ide him hear and let &s;lip: but it remains with him, works in him, and never leaves him, till the little word be turned up &s;ide-down by it; that is, till he become a new man. It is like the vapour that got up into <HI>Aba&s;uerus</HI>'s head, and cut off &s;leep from his eyes, E&s;ther vi 1. which proved a &s;pring of &s;uch motions, as never cea&s;ed, until <HI>Mordecai,</HI> in royal pomp, was brought on hor&s;e-back through the &s;treet, proud <HI>Haman</HI> trudging at his foot; the &s;ame <HI>Haman</HI> afterwards hanged, <HI>Mordecai</HI> advanced, and the church delivered from <HI>Haman</HI>'s helli&s;h <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. <HI>The grain of mu&s;tard-&s;eed

&mdash;becometh a tree,</HI> Matth. xiii. 21, 22. God loves to bring great things out of &s;mall beginnings.</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly,</HI> Natural generation is carried on by degrees, Job x. 10. <HI>Ha&s;t thou not poured me out as milk, and cruddled me like chee&s;e?</HI> So is regeneration. It is with the &s;oul, ordinarily, in regeneration, as with the blind man cured by our Lord, who fir&s;t <HI>&s;aw men as trees walking,</HI> afterwards &s;aw <HI>every man clearly,</HI> Matth. viii. 23, 24, 25. It is true, regeneration being, &s;trictly &s;peaking, a pa&s;&s;ing from death to life, the &s;oul is quickned in a moment: like as, when the embryo is brought to perfection in the womb, the &s;oul is infu&s;ed into the life|le&s;s lump. Neverthele&s;s, we may imagine &s;omewhat like conception in &s;piritual generation, whereby the &s;oul is prepared for quickening: and the new creature is capable of growth, 1 Pet. ii. 2. and of <HI>life more abundantly,</HI> John x. 10.</P>
<P><HI>Seventhly,</HI> In both there are new relations. The regenerate may call GOD, Father: for they are his children, John i. 12, 13. <HI>begotten of him,</HI> 1 Pet. i. 3. The bride, the <HI>Lamb</HI>'s <HI>wife,</HI> (that is the church) is <HI>their mother,</HI> Gal. iv. 27. They are related, as brethren, as &s;i&s;ters, to angels and glorified &s;aints, <HI>the family of heaven.</HI> They are of the heavenly &s;tock: and the meane&s;t of them, <HI>the ba&s;e things of the world,</HI> 1 Cor. i. 28. the kinle&s;s things, as the word imports, who cannot boo&s;t of the blood that runs in their veins, are yet, by their new birth, near of kin with the excellent of the earth.</P>
<P><HI>Eighthly,</HI> There is a likene&s;s betwixt the parent and the child. Every thing that generates, generates its like; and the regenerate are <HI>partakers of the divine nature,</HI> 2 Pet i. 4. the moral perfections of the divine nature are in mea&s;ure and degree communicated <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> renewed &s;oul, and thus the divine image is retrieved; &s;o that, as the child re&s;embles the father, the new creature re&s;embles God him&s;elf, being <HI>holy as he is holy.</HI></P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> As there is no birth without pain, both to the mother and to the child; &s;o there is great pain in bringing forth the new creature. The children have more or le&s;s of the&s;e birth-pains, whereby they are pricked in their heart, Acts ii. 37. The &s;oul has &s;ore pains when under conviction and humiliation, <HI>A wounded &s;pirit who can bear?</HI> The mother is pained, <HI>Zion travails,</HI> I&s;a. lxvi. 8. &s;he &s;ighs, groans, crieth, and hath hard labour, in her mini&s;ters and members, to bring <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">orth children to her Lord, Gal. iv. 10. <HI>My little children, of whom I travail in birth again, until Chri&s;t be formed in you.</HI> And never was a mother more feelingly touched with <HI>joy, that a man-child was born into the world,</HI> than &s;he is upon the new birth of her children. But w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> is more remarkable than all this, we read, not only of our Lord <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Chri&s;t's travail, (or toil of &s;oul) I&s;a. liii. 11. but (what l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ore directly to our purpo&s;e) of his pains, or pangs, as of one travelling in child birth; &s;o the word u&s;ed Acts ii. 24. properly &s;ignifies. Well may he call the new creature, as <HI>Rachel</HI> called her dear-bought &s;on, <HI>Benoni,</HI> i. e. <HI>The &s;on of my &s;orrow:</HI> and, as &s;he called another, <HI>Naphtali,</HI>

<P>USE I. By what is &s;aid, you may try whether you are in the &s;tate of grace or not. If ye be brought out of the &s;tate of wrath or ruin, into the &s;tate of grace or &s;alvation; ye are new creatures, ye are born again. But ye will &s;ay, "How &s;hall we know whether "we be born again or not?" <HI>An&s;.</HI> Do you a&s;k me, if the &s;un were ri&s;en, and how you &s;hould know, whether it were ri&s;en, or not? I would bid you look up to the heavens, and &s;ee it with your eyes. And would you know if the light be ri&s;en in your heart? Look in, and &s;ee. Grace is light, and di&s;covers it&s;elf. Look into thy mind, &s;ee if it has been illuminate in the knowledge of God. Ha&s;t thou been inwardly taught what God is? Were thine eyes ever turned inward to &s;ee thy&s;elf, the &s;infulne&s;s of thy depraved &s;tate; the corruption of thy nature; the &s;ins of thy heart and life? Wa&s;t thou ever let into a view of the exceeding &s;infulne&s;s of &s;in? Have thine eyes &s;een King <HI>Je&s;us</HI> in his beauty; the manifold wi&s;dom of God in him, his tran&s;cendent excellency, and ab&s;olute fulne&s;s and &s;ufficiency, with the vanity and emptine&s;s of all things el&s;e? Next, What change is there on thy will? Are the &s;etters taken off, wherewith it was &s;ometimes bound up from moving heaven|wards? And has thy will got a new &s;et? Do&s;t thou find an aver|&s;ion to &s;in, and a pronene&s;s to good wrought in thy heart? Is thy &s;oul turned towards God as thy chief end; is thy will new-molded, into &s;ome mea&s;ure of conformity to the preceptive and providen|tial will of God: Art thou heartily reconciled to the covenant of peace, and &s;ixedly di&s;po&s;ed to the receiving of Chri&s;t&punc; as he is offered in the go&s;pel? And as to a change on your affections, are they rectified, and placed on right objects? Are your de&s;ires going on after God? Are they "to his name, and remembrance of him?" I&s;a. xxvi. 8. Are your hopes in him? Is your love &s;et upon him, and your hatred &s;et again&s;t &s;in? Does your offending a good God affect your heart with &s;orrow, and do you fear &s;in more than &s;uffer|ing? Are your affections regulated? Are they, with re&s;pect to created comforts brought down, as being too high: and with re|&s;pect to God in Chri&s;t, &s;crewed up, as being too low? Has he the chief &s;eat in your heart? And are all your lawful worldly comforts and enjoyments laid at his feet? Has thy con&s;cience been enlight|ned and awakened, refu&s;ing all ea&s;e, but from the application of the blood of a Redeemer? Is thy memory &s;anctified, thy body con&s;ecrated to the &s;ervice of God? And art thou now walking in newne&s;s of life? Thus ye may di&s;cover, whether, ye are born again or not.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="045042_0146_101F7E67B633BF68">But, for your further help in this matter, I will di&s;cour&s;e a little of another &s;ign of regeneration, namely, <HI>The love of the brethren;</HI> an evidence whereby the weake&s;t and mo&s;t timorous &s;aints have often had comfort, when they could have little or no con&s;olation from other marks propo&s;ed to them. This the Apo&s;tle lays down, 1 John iii. 14. <Q>We know that we have pa&s;&s;ed from death unto life, becau&s;e we love the brethren.</Q>
It is not to be thought, that the Apo&s;tle, by <HI>the brethren</HI> in this place, means brethren by a common relation to the fir&s;t <HI>Adam,</HI> but to the &s;econd <HI>Adam,</HI> Chri&s;t Je&s;us: becau&s;e, however true it is, that univer&s;al benevolence, a good-will to the whole race of mankind, takes place in the renewed &s;oul, as being a lively lineament of the divine image; yet the whole context &s;peaks of tho&s;e that are the &s;ons of God, ver. 1, 2. children of God, ver. 10. born of God, ver. 9. di&s;tingui&s;hing betwixt the children of God, and the children of the devil, ver. 10. betwixt the&s;e that are of the devil, ver. 8, 12. and the&s;e that are of God, ver. 10. And the text it&s;elf comes in as a rea&s;on why we &s;hould not marvel that the world hates the brethren, the children of God, ver. 13. How can we marvel at it, &s;eeing the love of the brethren is an evidence of one's having pa&s;&s;ed from death to life? And therefore it were ab&s;urd to look for that love among&s;t the men of the world, whe are dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;in. They cannot love the brethren: no marvel then that they hate them. Wherefore it is plain, that by <HI>brethren</HI> here, are meant brethren by regeneration.</P>
<P>Now, in order to &s;et this mark of regeneration in a true light, con&s;ider the&s;e three things. (1.) This love to the brethren, is a love to them as &s;uch. Then do we love them in the &s;en&s;e of the text, when the grace, or image of God in them, is the chief motive of our love to them. When we love the godly for their godline&s;s, the &s;aints for their &s;anctity or holine&s;s: then we love God in them, and &s;o may conclude, we are born of God; for <HI>every one that loveth him that begat, loveth him al&s;o that is begotten of him,</HI> 1 John v. 1. Hypocrites may love &s;aints, on account of a civil relation to them; becau&s;e of their obliging conver&s;ation; for their being of the &s;ame opinion with them&s;elves in religious matters: and on many other &s;uch like accounts, whereby wicked men may be induced to love the godly. But happy they, who can love them for naked grace in them; for their heaven-born temper and di&s;po&s;ition; who can pick this pearl out of a dunghill of infirmities in, and about them; lay hold on it, and love them for it. (2.) It is a love that will be given to all, in whom the grace of God appears. They that love one &s;aint, becau&s;e he is a &s;aint, will have love to all the &s;aints, Eph. i. 15. They will love all, who to their di&s;cerning, bear the image of God. They that cannot love a gracious per&s;on in rags, but confine their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ove to the&s;e of them who wear gay cloathing, have not this love to the brethren in them. There who can con|f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ne their love to a party, to whom God has not confined his grace, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> too narrow to be put among the children. In what
<PB N="150" REF="045042_0147_101F7E6C1C14B880">
points &s;oever men differ from us, in their judgment or way: yet if they appear to agree with us, in love to God, and our Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and in bearing his image; we will love them as brethren, if we our&s;elves be of the heavenly family And, (3.) If this love be in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">che more grace any per&s;on appear to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, he will be the more beloved by us. The more vehemently the holy fire of grace doth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lame in any, the hearts of true Chri&s;tians will be the more warmed in love to them It is not with the &s;aints as with many other men, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> them&s;elves the &s;tandard for others: and love them &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> they think they are like them|&s;elves. But, if they &s;eem to out-mine, and larken them, their love is turned to hatred and envy; and they endeavour to detract from the du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> prai&s;e of their exemplary piety; becau&s;e nothing reli&s;heth with them in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> practice of religion, that goes beyond their own mea&s;ure; what of the life and power of religion appears in others, &s;erves only to rai&s;e the &s;erpentine grudge in their <HI>Phari&s;aical</HI> hearts. But, as for them that are born again; their love and affection to the brethren, bears proportion to the degrees of the divine image they di&s;cern in them.</P>
<P>Now, if ye would improve the&s;e things to the knowledge of your &s;tate, I would advi&s;e you, (1.) To &s;et apart &s;ome time, when ye are at home, for a review of your ca&s;e, and try your &s;tate, by what has been &s;aid. Many have comfort and clearne&s;s as to their &s;tate, at a &s;ermon; who in a little time lo&s;e it again: becau&s;e, while they hear the word preached, they make application of it; but do not con&s;ider of the&s;e things more deliberately and lei&s;urely when alone. The action is too &s;udden and &s;hort, to give la&s;ting comfort. And it is often &s;o indeliberate, that it has bad con&s;e|quences. Therefore, &s;et about this work at home, after earne&s;t and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> prayer to God for his help in it. Complain not of your want <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> while the night follows the bu&s;y day; or of place, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> and out-hou&s;es are to be got. (2.) Renew your repentance before the Lord. Guilt lying on the con&s;cience, un|repented of, may darken all your evidences and marks of grace. It provokes the Spirit of grace to depart; and when he goes, our light cea&s;es. It is not &s;it time for a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to read his evidences, when the candle is blown out by &s;ome con&s;cience-wounding guilt. <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> Exert the powers of the new nature; let the graces of the divine Spirit in you, di&s;cover them&s;elves by action. If ye would know whether there is a &s;acred fire in your brea&s;t, or not, ye mu&s;t blow the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">al: for altho' it be, and be a live-coal; yet if it be under the a&s;hes, it will give you no light. Settle in your hearts a firm purpo&s;e, thro' the grace that is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, to comply with every known duty, and watch again&s;t every known &s;in; hav|ing a readine&s;s of mind, to be in&s;tructed in what ye know not. If gracious &s;ouls would thus manage their inquiries into their &s;tate; it is likely, they would have a comfortable i&s;&s;ue. And if others w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d take &s;uch a &s;olemn review and make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rial of their &s;tate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m|partially,

The &s;trength of our affections is to be mea&s;ured by the firmne&s;s and fixedne&s;s of the root: not by the violence of their actings. Suppo&s;e a per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on meeting with a friend w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o has been long abroad, finds his affection more vehe|mently acting toward his friend on that occa&s;ion, than towards his own wife and children; will he therefore &s;ay that he loves his friend more than them? Surely no. Even &s;o, although the Chri&s;|tian may find him&s;elf more moved in his love to the creature, than in his love to God; yet he is not therefore to be &s;aid to love the creature more than God; &s;eeing love to God is always more firmly rooted in a gracious heart, than love to any created enjoyment what&s;oever: as appears when competition ari&s;es in &s;uch a manner, that the one or the other is to be forgone. Would you then know your ca&s;e? Retire into your own hearts, and there lay the two in the balance, and try which of them weighs down the other. A&s;k thy&s;elf, as in the &s;ight of God, whether thou would&s;t part with Chri&s;t for the creature, or part with the creature for Chri&s;t, if thou were left to thy choice in the matter? If you find your heart di&s;po&s;ed to part with what is deare&s;t to you in the world for Chri&s;t, at his call: you have no rea&s;on to conclude you love the creature more than God; but on the contrary, that you love God more than the creature; albeit you do not feel &s;uch v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> motions in the love of God, as in the love of &s;ome created thing, Matt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> x. 37. <HI>He that loveth father or mother more than me, is not worthy of me.</HI> Luke xiv. 26. <HI>If any man come to me, and hate not his father and mother,&mdash;he cannot be my di&s;ciple.</HI> From which texts compared, we may infer, that he who hates, <HI>i. e.</HI> is rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y to part with father and mother for Chri&s;t, is, in our Lord's account, one that loves them le&s;s than him; and not one who loves father and mother more than him.

While the fire-edge is upon the young convert, be looks upon others, reputed to be godly, and not finding them in &s;uch a temper and di&s;po&s;ition as him&s;elf, he is ready to cen&s;ure them; and think there is far le&s;s religion in the world, than indeed there is. But when his own cup comes to &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> below the brim, and he finds that in him&s;elf, which made him que&s;tion the &s;tate of others, he is more humbled, and feels more and more the nece&s;&s;ity of daily recour&s;e to the blood of Chri&s;t for pardon, and to the Spirit of Chri&s;t for &s;anctification; and thus grows downwards in humiliation; &s;elf-loathing, and &s;elf-denial. (2.) There is a rational love to Chri&s;t, which, without the&s;e &s;en&s;ible emotions felt in the former ca&s;e, evidences it&s;elf by a dutiful regard to the divine authority and command. When one bears &s;uch a love to Chri&s;t, tho' the vehement &s;tirrings of affection be wanting, yet he is truly tender of offending a gracious God; endeavours to walk before him <HI>unto all plea&s;ing;</HI> and grieved at the heart, for what is di&s;plea&s;ing unto him, 1 John v. 3. <HI>For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments.</HI> Now, although that &s;en&s;ible love doth not always continue with you: yet ye have no rea&s;on to account it a hypocritical fit, while the rational love remains with you, more than a faithful and loving wife needs que&s;tion her love to her hu&s;band, when her fondne&s;s is abated.</P>
<P>CASE V.
<Q>The attainments of hypocrites and apo&s;tates are a terror to me, and come like a &s;haking &s;to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> on me, when I am about to conclude from the marks of grace which I &s;eem to find in my&s;elf, that I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the &s;tate of grace.</Q>

Sirs, ye &s;ee the out&s;ide of hypocrites, their duties, their gifts, their tears, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but ye &s;ee not their in&s;ide; ye do not di&s;cern their hearts, the bias of their &s;pirits. Upon what ye &s;ee of them, ye found a judgment of charity, as to their &s;tate; and ye do well to judge charitably in &s;uch a ca&s;e, becau&s;e ye cannot know the &s;ecret &s;prings of their actings: But ye are &s;peaking, and ought to have a judgment of certainty, as to your own &s;tate; and therefore are to look in to that part of religion, which none in the world but your&s;elves can di&s;cern in you; and which ye can as little &s;ee in others. An hypocrite's religion may appear far greater than that of a &s;incere &s;oul: but, that which makes the greate&s;t figure in the eyes of men, is often lea&s;t worth before God. I would rather utter one of the&s;e groans the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks of, Rom. viii. 26. than &s;hed <HI>E&s;au</HI>'s tears, have <HI>Balaam</HI>'s prophetic &s;pirit, or the joy of the &s;tony-ground hearers. The fire that &s;hall try every man's work, will try, not of what bulk it is, but of what &s;ort it is, 1 Cor. iii. 13. Now, ye may know what bulk of religion another has: and what tho' it be more bulky than your own? God doth not regard that: Why then do you make &s;uch a matter of it? It is impo&s;&s;ible for you, without divine revelation, certainly to know of what &s;ort another man's

religion is: but ye may certainly know what &s;ort your own is of, with|out extraordinary revelation; otherwi&s;e the Apo&s;tle would not exhort the &s;aints to give diligence to make their calling and election &s;ure, 2 Pet i. 10. Therefore, the attainments of hypo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rites and apo&s;tates &s;hould not di&s;turb you in your &s;erious inquiry into your own &s;tate. But I'll tell you two things wherein the meane&s;t &s;aints go beyond the mo&s;t refined hypocrites. (1) In denying them&s;elves, renouncing all confidence in them&s;elves, and their own works, acquie&s;cing in, being well-plea&s;ed with, and venturing their &s;ouls upon God's plan of &s;al|vation thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t, Matth. v. 3. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are the poor in &s;pirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</HI> And chap. xi. 6. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed is he who&s;oever &s;hall not be offended in me.</HI> Philip. iii. 3. <HI>We are the circum|ci&s;ion which wor&s;hip God in the &s;pirit, and rejoice in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and have no confidence in the fle&s;h.</HI> (2.) In a real hatred of all &s;in; being willing to part with every lu&s;t, without exception, and comply with every duty the Lord makes, or &s;hall make known to them: P&s;al. cxix 6. <HI>Then &s;hall I not be a&s;hamed, when I have re&s;pect unto all thy commandments.</HI> Try your&s;elves by the&s;e.</P>
<P>CASE VI.
<Q>I &s;ee my&s;elf fall &s;o far &s;hort of the &s;aints mentioned in the &s;criptures, and of &s;everal excellent per&s;ons of my own ac|quaintance; that, when I look on them, I can hardly look on my|&s;elf as one of the &s;ame family with them.</Q>
<HI>An&s;.</HI> It is indeed matter of humiliation, that we get not forward to that mea&s;ure of grace and holine&s;s, which we &s;ee is attainable in this life. This &s;hould make us more vigorou&s;ly pre&s;s towards the mark: But &s;urely it is from the devil, that weak Chri&s;tians make a rack for them&s;elves of the attain|ments of the &s;trong. And to yield to this temptation, is as unrea&s;on|able, as for a child to di&s;pute away his relation to his father, becau&s;e he is not of the &s;ame &s;tature with his elder brethren. There are &s;aints of &s;everal &s;izes in Chri&s;t's family: &s;ome fathers, &s;ome young men, and &s;ome little children, 1 John ii. 13, 14.</P>
<P>CASE VII.
<Q>I never read in the word of God, nor did I ever know of a child of God &s;o tempted, and &s;o left of God as I am; and therefore no &s;aint's ca&s;e being like mine, I cannot <HI>but conclude I am none of their number.</HI></Q>
<HI>An&s;.</HI> This objection ari&s;es to &s;ome from their unacquaintedne&s;s with the &s;criptures, and with experienced Chri&s;tians. It is profitable in this ca&s;e, to impart the matter to &s;ome experienced Chri&s;tian friend, or to &s;ome godly mini&s;ter. This has been a ble&s;&s;ed mean of peace to &s;ome per&s;ons; while their ca&s;e, which appeared to them to be &s;ingular, has been evinced to have been the ca&s;e of other &s;aints. The &s;cripture give in&s;tances of very horrid temptations, wherewith the &s;aints have been a&s;&s;aulted: <HI>Job</HI> was temp|ted to <HI>bla&s;pheme;</HI> this was the great thing the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">vil aimed at, in the ca&s;e of that g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">t &s;aint, Job i. 11. <HI>He will cur&s;e thee to thy f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e.</HI> Chap. ii. 9. <HI>Cur&s;e God and die, A&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ph</HI> was tempted to think, it was in vain to be religious; which was in effect to throw <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> religion, P&s;al lxx<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ii. 13. <HI>Verily I have clean&s;ed my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in vain.</HI> Ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, Chri&s;t

him&s;elf was tempted <HI>to ca&s;t him&s;elf down from a pinacle of the temple,</HI> and to wor&s;hip the devil, Matth iv. 6, 9. And many of the children of God have not only been attacked with, but have actually yielded to very gro&s;s temptations for a time. <HI>Peter</HI> denied CHRIST, and cur&s;ed and &s;wore that he know him not. Mark xiv. 71. <HI>Paul,</HI> when a per|&s;ecuter, compelled even &s;aints to bla&s;pheme, Acts xxvi. 10, 11. Many of the &s;aints can, from their &s;ad experience, bear witne&s;s to very gro&s;s temptations, which have a&s;toni&s;hed their &s;pirits, made their very fle&s;h to tremble, and &s;ickened their bodies. Satan's fiery darts make ter|rible work; and will co&s;t pains to quench them, by a vigorous manag|ing of the &s;hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ld of faith, Ephe&s;. vi 16. Sometimes, he makes &s;uch de&s;perate attacks, that never was one more put to it, in running to and fro, without intermi&s;&s;ion to quench the fire-balls ince&s;&s;antly thrown into his hou&s;e by an enemy de&s;igning to burn the hou&s;e about him; than the poor tempted &s;aint is, to repel &s;atanical injections. But the&s;e injections, the&s;e horrid temptations, though they are a dreadful afflic|tion, they are not the &s;ins of the tempted, unle&s;s they make them theirs by con&s;enting to them. They will be charged upon the tempter alone, if they be not con&s;ented to; and will no more be laid to the charge of the tempted party, than a ba&s;tard's being laid down at the cha&s;te man's door, will fix guilt upon him. But, &s;uppo&s;e neither mini&s;ter nor private Chri&s;tian, to whom you go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> can tell you of any who has been in your ca&s;e; yet you ought not thence to infer, that your ca&s;e certainly is &s;ingular, far le&s;s to give over hopes: for it is not to be thought, that every godly mini&s;ter, or private Chri&s;tian, has had the experience of all the ca&s;es a child of God may be in. And we need not doubt but &s;ome have had di&s;tre&s;&s;es known only to God, and their own con&s;ciences; and, &s;o, to others the&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;es are as if they had never been. Yea, and though the &s;cripture do contain &s;uitable directions for every ca&s;e a child of God can be in; and the&s;e illu&s;trated with a &s;ufficient number of examples: yet it is not to be imagined, that there are in the &s;criptures perfect in&s;tances of every particular ca&s;e incident to the &s;aints. Therefore, howbeit you cannot find an in&s;tance of your ca&s;e in the &s;cripture; yet bring your ca&s;e to it, and you &s;hall find &s;uitable remedies pre&s;cribed there for it And &s;tudy rather to make u&s;e of Chri&s;t for your ca&s;e, who has &s;alve for all &s;ores; than to know if ever any was in your ca&s;e Tho' one &s;hould &s;hew you an in&s;tance of your ca&s;e, in an undoubted &s;aint; yet none could promi&s;e it would certainly give you ea&s;e: for a &s;crupulous con&s;cience would readily find out &s;ome difference. And if nothing but a perfect conformity of another's ca&s;e to yours, will &s;atisfy, it will be hard, if not impo&s;&s;ible to &s;atisfy you. For it is with people's ca&s;es, as with their natural faces: though faces of all men are of one make; and &s;ome are &s;o very like others, that, at fir&s;t view we are ready to take them for the &s;ame: yet if you view them more accurately, you will &s;ee &s;omething in every face, di&s;tingui&s;hing it from all others: though po&s;&s;ibly you cannot tell what it is; wherefore I conclude, that if you

can find in your&s;elves the marks of regeneration, propo&s;ed to you from the word; you ought to conclude, you are in the &s;tate of grace, though your ca&s;e were &s;ingular, which is indeed unlikely.</P>
<P>CASE <HI>la&s;t,</HI> <Q>The afflictions I meet with are &s;trange and unu&s;ual. I doubt if ever a child of God was try&s;ted with &s;uch di&s;pen&s;ations of providence as I am</Q>

Sometimes we travel in ways, where we cannot perceive the prints of the foot of man or bea&s;t; yet we cannot from thence conclude, that there was never any there before us: &s;o, albeit thou can&s;t not per|ceive the foot&s;teps of the flock in the way of thine affliction; thou mu&s;t not therefore conclude, thou art the fir&s;t that ever travelled that road. But, what, if it were &s;o, that thou wert indeed the fir&s;t? Some one &s;aint or other behoved to be the fir&s;t, in drinking of each bitter cup the re&s;t have drunk of.

ri&s;e of that difference; without which never one would have received him. He tells us, that as many as received him, were the&s;e which were born&mdash;of God, John i. 11, 12, 13. Unregenerate men may pre&s;ume; but true faith they cannot have. Faith is a flower, that grows not in the field of nature. As the tree cannot grow without a root, neither can a man believe without the new nature, whereof the principle of believing is a part. (2.) Without regene|ration a man's works are dead works. As is the principle, &s;o mu&s;t the effects be: if the lungs be rotten, the breath will be un&s;avoury; and he who at be&s;t is dead in &s;in, his works at be&s;t will be but dead works. <HI>Unto them that are defiled and unbelieving, is nothing pure&mdash; being abominable, and di&s;obedient, and unto every good work, reprobate,</HI> Tit i. 15, 16. Could we &s;ay of a man, that he is more blamele&s;s in his life, than any other in the world; that he macerates his body with fa&s;ting; and has made his knees as horns with continual praying; but he is not born again: that exception would mar all. And if one &s;hould &s;ay, there is a well-proportioned body, but the &s;oul is gone, it is but a dead lump.

<P>If thou art not born again, (1.) All thy reformation is naught in the &s;ight of God. Thou ha&s;t &s;hut the door, but the thief is &s;till in the hou&s;e.

(2.) Thy prayers <HI>are an abomination to the Lord,</HI> Prov xv. 8. It may be, others admire thy &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s; thou crie&s;t as for thy life: but God accounts of the opening of thy mouth, as one would account of the opening of a grave full of rottenne&s;s, Rom. iii. 13. <HI>Their throat is an open &s;epulchre.</HI> Others are affected with thy prayers; which &s;eem to them, as if thy would rend the heavens: but God accounts them as the howling of a dog: <HI>They have not cried unto me with their heart, when they howled upon their beds,</HI> Ho&s;. vii. 14. Others take thee for a wre&s;tler and prevailer with God; but he can take no delight with thee, nor thy prayers neither, I&s;a. lxvi. 3. <HI>He that killeth an ox, is as if he &s;lew a man: he that &s;acrificeth a lamb, is as if he cut off a dog's neck,&mdash;he that burneth incen&s;e, as if he ble&s;&s;ed an idol.</HI> Why not?

It may be, thou art zealous again&s;t &s;in in others, and do&s;t admoni&s;h them to their duty, and reprove them for their &s;in; and they hate thee, becau&s;e thou do&s;t thy duty. But I mu&s;t tell thee, God hates thee too, becau&s;e thou do&s;t it not in a right manner; and that thou can&s;t never do, whil&s;t thou art not born again. <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> All thy &s;truggles again&s;t &s;in, in thine own heart and life, are naught. The proud <HI>Phari&s;ee</HI> afflicted his body with fa&s;ting, and God &s;truck his &s;oul in the mean time with a &s;entence of condemnation, Luke xviii. <HI>Balaam</HI> &s;truggled with his covetous temper to that degree, that though he loved the wages of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, yet he would not win them by cur&s;ing <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> but he died the death of the wicked, Numb. xxxi. 8. All thou do&s;t while in an unregenerate &s;tate is for thy&s;elf: and therefore it will fare with thee, as with a &s;ubject, who having reduced the rebels, put the crown on his own head; and therefore lo&s;eth all his good &s;ervice, and his head too.</P>

But there is a mids betwixt omitting of duty, and the doing of it as th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u do&s;t it. A man ordereth ma&s;ons to build a hou&s;e: if they quite neglect the work, that will not be accepted; if they fall on, and build upon the old rotten foundation, neither will that plea&s;e; but they mu&s;t raze the old foundation, and build on firm ground <HI>Go thou and do likewi&s;e.</HI> In the mean time, it is not in vain for thee, even for thee, to &s;eek the Lord: for tho' he regards thee not, yet he may have re&s;pect to his own ordinance, and do thee good thereby, as was &s;aid before.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Without regeneration there is no communion with God. There is a &s;ociety on earth, who&s;e <HI>fellow&s;hip is with the Father, and with the Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> 1 John i. 3. But out of that &s;ociety all the unregenerate are excluded; for they are all enemies to God, as ye heard before at large. Now, <HI>can two walk together, except they be agreed?</HI> Amos iii. 3. They are all unholy: and <HI>what communion hath light with darkne&s;s&mdash;Chri&s;t with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">lial?</HI> 2 Cor. vi. 14, 15. They may have a &s;hew and &s;emblance of holine&s;s, but they are &s;trangers to true holine&s;s, and therefore without God in the world. How &s;ad is this ca&s;e, to be imployed in religious duties, but to have no fellow&s;hip
<PB N="160" REF="045042_0157_101F7E87E467A808">
with God in them! ye would not be content with your meat, unle&s;s it fed you; nor with your clothes, unle&s;s they kept you warm: and and how can you &s;atisfy your&s;elves with your duties, while they are not effectual to your communion with God?</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Regeneration is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to qualify you for heaven. None go to heaven but they that are made meet for it, Col. i. 12. As it was with <HI>Solomon</HI>'s temple, 1 Kings vi 7. &s;o it is with the temple above: <HI>It is built of &s;tone made ready before it is brought thither;</HI> namely, of lively &s;tones, 1 Pet ii. 5 <HI>wrought for the &s;ame thing,</HI> 2 Cor. v 5. for they cannot be laid in that glorious build|ing, ju&s;t as they came out of the quarry of depraved nature: Jewels of gold are not meet for &s;wine, and far le&s;s jewels of glory for unre|newed &s;inners. Beggars in their rags are not meet for king's hou&s;es; nor &s;inners to enter into the king's palace, without the raiment of needle-work, P&s;al. xlv 14, 15. What wi&s;e man would bring fi&s;hes out of the water to feed in his meadow? or &s;end his oxen to feed in the &s;ea? Even as little are the unregenerate meet for heaven, or is heaven meet for them It would never be liked of by them.</P>
<P>The unregenerate would find f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ult with heaven on &s;everal accounts. As (1.) That it is a &s;trange country. Heaven is the renewed man's native country: his Father is in heaven; his mother is Jeru&s;alem, which is above, Gal. iv 26 He is <HI>born from above,</HI> John iii 3. Heaven is his home, 2 Cor. v. 1. Therefore he looks on him&s;elf as a &s;tranger on this earth, and his head is homeward, Heb. xi. 16 <HI>They de&s;ire a better country, that is, an heavenly.</HI> But the unregenerate man is the man of the earth, P&s;al. x. 18. <HI>written in the earth,</HI> Jer. xvii 13. Now, <HI>home is home, be it never &s;o homely,</HI> therefore he <HI>minds earthly things,</HI> Philip. iii. 19. There is a peculiar &s;weetne&s;s in our native &s;oil; and hardly are men drawn to leave it, and dwell in a &s;trange country. In no ca&s;e does that prevail more, than in this; for unrenewed men would quit their preten&s;ions to heaven, were it not that they &s;ee they cannot make a better of it. (2.) There is nothing thereof what they delight mo&s;t in, as mo&s;t agreeable to the carnal heart, Rev. xxi. 27. <HI>And there &s;hall in no wi&s;e enter into it, any thing that d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fileth.</HI> When <HI>Mahomet</HI> gave out paradi&s;e to be a place of &s;en&s;ual delights, his religion was greedily embraced: for that is the heaven men naturally chu&s;e. If the covetous man could get bags full of gold there, and the voluptuous man can promi&s;e him&s;elf his &s;en&s;ual delights there; they might be reconciled to heaven, and meet for it too: but &s;ince it is not &s;o, tho' they may utter fair words about it, truly it has little of their hearts. (3.) Ever<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> corner there is filled with that, which of all things they have the lea&s;t liking of: and that is holine&s;s, true holine&s;s, perfect holine&s;s Were one that abhors &s;wine's fle&s;h, bidden to a fea&s;t, where all the di&s;hes were of that &s;ort of meat, but variou&s;ly prepared; he would find fault with every di&s;h at the table, notwith&s;tanding all the art u&s;ed to make them palatable. It is true, there is joys in heaven, but it is holy joy: there are plea|&s;ures
<PB N="161" REF="045042_0158_101F7E8F75448538">
in heaven, but they are holy plea&s;ures: there are places to &s;tand by in heaven, but it is holy ground. That holine&s;s that ca&s;ts up in every place, and in every thing there, would mar all to the unre|generate (4.) Were they carried thither, they would not only change their place, which would be a great heart break to them: but they would change their company too. Truly they would never like the company there, who care not for communion with God here; nor value the fellow&s;hip of his people, at lea&s;t in the vitals of practical godline&s;s. Many indeed mix them&s;elves with the godly on earth, to procure a name to them&s;elves, and to cover the naughtine&s;s of their hearts: but that trade could not be managed there. (5.) They would never like the employment of heaven, they care &s;o little for it now. The bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;aints there, would be an intolerable burden to them, &s;eeing it is not agreeable to their nature To be taken up in beholding, admiring, and prai&s;ing of <HI>him that &s;itteth upon the throne, and of the Lamb,</HI> would be work un&s;uitable, and therefore un&s;avoury to an unrenewed &s;oul. <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> They would find this fault with it, that the whole is of everla&s;ting continuance. This would be a killing ingredient in it, to them. How would &s;uch as now account the Sabbath-day a burden, brook the celebrating of an everla&s;ting Sabbath in the heavens?</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> Regeneration is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to your being admitted into heaven, John iii. 3. No heaven without it Tho' carnal men could dige&s;t all the&s;e things, which make heaven &s;o un&s;uitable for them; yet God will never &s;uffer them to come thither Therefore born again ye mu&s;t be: el&s;e ye &s;hall never &s;ee heaven, ye &s;hall peri&s;h eternally. For, (1.) There is a bill of exclu&s;ion again&s;t you in the court of heaven, and again&s;t all your &s;ort: <HI>Except a man be born again, he cannot &s;ee the kingdom of God,</HI> John iii. 3. Here is a bar before you, that men and angels cannot remove. And to hope for heaven, over the belly of this peremptory &s;entence, is to hope that God will recal his word, and &s;acrifice his truth and faithfulne&s;s to your &s;afety; which is infinitely more than to hope <HI>the earth &s;hall be for&s;aken for you, and the rock removed out of his place</HI> (2) There is no holine&s;s without regeneration. It is the new man, which is <HI>created in true holine&s;s,</HI> Eph. iv. 24. And no heaven without holine&s;s; for <HI>without holine&s;s no man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord,</HI> Heb. xii. 14 Will the gates of pearl be opened, to let in dogs and &s;wine? No; their place is without, Rev. xxii. 15. God will not admit &s;uch into the holy place of com|munion with him here; and will he admit them into the holie&s;t of all hereafter? Will he take the children of the devil, and give them to &s;it with him in his throne? Or will he bring the unclean into the city, who&s;e &s;treet is pure gold? Be not deceived, grace and glory are but two links of one chain, which God has joined, and no man &s;hall put a&s;under. None are tran&s;planted into the paradi&s;e above, but out of the nur&s;ery of grace below. If ye be unholy while in this world, ye will be for ever mi&s;erable in the world to come. (3.) All the

unregenerate are without Chri&s;t, and therefore having no hope while in that ca&s;e, Eph. ii. 12. Will Chri&s;t prepare man&s;ions of glory for them, that refu&s;e to receive him into their hearts? Nay; rather, will he not <HI>laugh at their calamity,</HI> who now <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">et at nought all his coun&s;el?</HI> Prov. i. 25, 26. <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> There is an infallible connection betwixt a finally unregenerate &s;tate and damnation, ri&s;ing from the nature of the things them&s;elves: and from the decree of heaven, which is fixed and unmoveable as mountains of bra&s;s, John iii. 3. Rom. viii. 6. <HI>To be carnally minded is death.</HI> An unregenerate &s;tate is hell in the bud. It is eternal de&s;truction in embryo; growing daily, tho' thou do&s;t not di&s;cern it. Death is painted on many a fair face, in this life. Depraved nature makes men meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the damned, in utter darkne&s;s. (1.) The heart of &s;tone within thee, is a &s;inking weight, as a &s;tone naturally goes downward; &s;o the hard &s;tony heart tends downward to the bottomle&s;s pit. Ye are hardned again&s;t reproof: though ye are told your danger; yet you will not &s;ee it, ye will not believe it. But remember, that the con&s;cience its being now feared with a hot iron, is a &s;ad pre&s;age of everla&s;ting burnings. (2.) Your unfruitfulne&s;s under the means of grace, fits you for the ax of God's judgments, Matth. iii. 10. <HI>Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit, is hewn down, and ca&s;t into the fire.</HI> The withered branch is fuel for the fire, John xv. 6. Tremble at this ye de&s;pi&s;ers of the go&s;pel: if ye be not thereby made meet for heaven, ye will be like the barren ground, bearing briers and thorns, nigh <HI>unto cur&s;ing, who&s;e end is to be burned,</HI> Heb. vi. 8. (3.) The helli&s;h di&s;po&s;ition of mind, which di&s;cover them&s;elves in profanity of life, fit the guilty for the regions of horror. A profane life will have a mi&s;er|able end. <HI>They which do &s;uch things &s;hall not inherit the kingdom of God,</HI> Gal. v. 19, 20, 21. Think on this, ye prayerle&s;s per&s;ons, ye mockers of religion, ye cur&s;ers and &s;wearers, ye unclean, and unju&s;t per&s;ons, who have not &s;o much as moral hone&s;ty to keep you from lying, cheating and &s;tealing. What &s;ort of a tree think ye it to be, upon which the&s;e fruits grow? Is it a tree of righteou&s;ne&s;s, which the Lord hath planted? Or is it &s;uch an one as cumbers the ground, which God will pluck up for fuel to the fire of his wrath? (4.) Your being dead in &s;in makes you meet to be wrapt in flames of brim&s;tone, as a winding &s;heet; and to be buried in the bottomle&s;s pit, as in a grave. Great was the cry in <HI>Egypt,</HI> when the fir&s;t-born in each family was dead; but are there not many families, where all are dead together? Nay, many there are, who are <HI>twice dead, plucked up by the roots.</HI> Sometime, in their life, they have been rouzed by apprehen|&s;ions of death, and its con&s;equences; but now they are &s;o far on in their way to the land of darkne&s;s, that they hardly ever have the lea&s;t glimmering of light from heaven. (5.) The darkne&s;s of your minds pre&s;ageth eternal darkne&s;s O the horrible ignorance &s;ome are plagued with while others who have got &s;ome rays of morning light into their heads; are utterly void of &s;piritual light in their hearts! If

ye knew your ca&s;e, ye would cry out, Oh! darkne&s;s! darkne&s;s! dark|ne&s;s making way for the blackne&s;s of darkne&s;s for ever! The face-covering is upon you already, as condemned per&s;ons; &s;o near are ye to everla&s;ting darkne&s;s. It is only Je&s;us Chri&s;t who can &s;top the execution, pull the napkin off the face of the condemned malefactor, and put a pardon in his hand, I&s;a. xxv. 7. <HI>And he will de&s;troy in this mountain, the face of the covering ca&s;t over all people,</HI> i e. The face-covering ca&s;t over the condemned, as in <HI>Haman</HI>'s ca&s;e, E&s;ther vii. 8. <HI>As the word went out of the king</HI>'s <HI>mouth, they covered Human</HI>'s <HI>face.

Sometimes their con&s;ciences &s;tir within them, and they begin to think of amending their ways. But alas! they are in chains, they cannot do it. They are chained by the heart; their lu&s;ts cleave &s;o fa&s;t to them, that they cannot, nay, they will not, &s;hake them off. Thus you &s;ee what affinity there is betwixt an unregenerate &s;tate, and the &s;tate of the damned, the &s;tate of ab&s;o|&s;olute and irretrievable mi&s;ery; be convinced then, that ye mu&s;t be born again; put a high value on the new birth, and eagerly de&s;ire it.</P>
<P>The text tells you, that <HI>the word is the &s;eed,</HI> whereof the new creature is formed: therefore take heed to it, and entertain it, for it is your life. Apply your&s;elves to the reading of the Scripture. Ye that cannot read, cau&s;e others read it to you. Wait diligently on the preaching of the word, as by divine appointment, the &s;pecial mean of conver&s;ion: <HI>for&mdash;it plea&s;ed God by the fooli&s;hne&s;s of preaching to &s;ave them that believe,</HI> 1 Cor. i. 21. Wherefore ca&s;t not your&s;elves out of Chri&s;t's way; reject not the means of grace, le&s;t ye be found to judge your&s;elves unworthy of eternal life. Attend carefully to the word preached. Hear every &s;ermon, as if you were hearing for eternity: and take heed, the fowls of the air pick not up this &s;eed from you as it is &s;own. Give thy&s;elf wholly to it, 1 Tim iv 15. Receive it not as the word of men, but (as it is in truth) the word of God, 1 The&s;&s; ii. 13. And hear it with application, looking on it as a me&s;&s;age &s;ent from heaven, to you in particular tho' not to you only, Rev iii. 22 <HI>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit &s;aith unto the churches</HI> Lay it up in your hearts, meditate upon it: and be not as the unclean bea&s;ts, that chew not the cud. But by earne&s;t prayer beg the dew of heaven may fall on thy heart, that the &s;eed may &s;pring up there.</P>
<P>More particularly, (1.) Receive the te&s;timony of the word of God, concerning the mi&s;ery of an unregenerate &s;tate, the &s;infulne&s;s thereof, and the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of regeneration. (2.) Receive its te&s;timony concerning God, what a holy and ju&s;t one he is. (3.) Examine thy ways by it; namely, the thoughts of thy heart, the expre&s;&s;ions of thy lips, and the tenor of thy life Look back through the &s;everal periods of thy life, and &s;ee thy &s;ins from the precepts of the word; and learn from its threatnings, what thou art liable to, on the account of

the&s;e &s;ins. (4.) View the corruption of thy nature, by the help of the &s;ame word of God; as a gla&s;s which repre&s;ents our ugly face in a lively manner.

<HEAD>HEAD II. The MYSTICAL UNION betwixt CHRIST and Believers.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>JOHN xv. 5.</BIBL>
<P>I am the Vine, ye are the Branches.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>HAVING &s;poken of the change, made by regeneration on all tho&s;e that &s;hall inherit eternal life, in oppo&s;ition to their natural real &s;tate, the &s;tate of degeneracy; I proceed to &s;peak of the change made upon them, in their union with the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in oppo&s;ition to their natural relative &s;tate, the &s;tate of mi&s;ery. The doctrine of the &s;aints union with Chri&s;t is very plainly and fully in|&s;i&s;ted on, from the beginning of the 12th ver&s;e of this chapter; which is a part of our Lord's fare-well &s;ermon to his di&s;ciples. Sorrow had now filled their hearts; they were apt to &s;ay,
<Q>Alas! What will become of us, when our Ma&s;ter is taken trom our head? Who will then in&s;truct us? Who will &s;olve our doubts? How will we be &s;upported under our difficulties and di&s;couragements? How will we be able to live without our wonted communications with him?</Q>
Wherefore our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;ea&s;onably teaches them the my&s;tery of their union with him, comparing him&s;elf to the vine-&s;tock, and them to the branches.</P>
<P>He compares, I &s;ay, (1.) Him&s;elf to a vine &s;tock: <HI>I am the Vine:</HI> He had been celebrating, with his di&s;ciples, the Sacrament of his Supper, that &s;ign and &s;eal of his people's union with him&s;elf; and
<PB N="165" REF="045042_0162_101F7E9BA382AED8">
had told them, he would <HI>drink no more of the fruit of the vine, till</HI> he &s;hould <HI>drink it new with</HI> them <HI>in</HI> his <HI>Father</HI>'s <HI>kingdom:</HI> and now he &s;hews him&s;elf to be the Vine, from whence the wine of their con&s;o|lation &s;hould come. The vine hath le&s;s beauty than many other trees: but is exceeding fruitful; fitly repre&s;enting the low condition our Lord was then in, yet bringing many &s;ons to glory. But that which is chiefly aimed at, in his comparing him&s;elf to a vine, is to repre&s;ent him&s;elf as the &s;upporter and nouri&s;her of his people, in whom they live, and bring forth fruit. (2.) He compares them to the branches, <HI>ye are the branches</HI> of that Vine. Ye are the branches knit to, and growing on this &s;tock: drawing all your life and &s;ap from it. It is a beautiful compari&s;on; as if he had &s;aid, <HI>I am as a Vine, ye are as the branche<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of that Vine.</HI> Now there are two &s;orts of branches: (1.) Natural branches, which at fir&s;t &s;pring out of the &s;tock: the&s;e are the branches that are in the tree, and were never out of it. (2) There are ingrafted branches, which are branches broken off from the tree that fir&s;t gave their life; and put into ano|ther to grow upon it. Thus branches come to be on a tree, which originally were not on it. The branches mentioned in the text, are of the latter &s;ort; <HI>branches broken off,</HI> (as the word in the original language denotes) namely, from the tree that fir&s;t gave them life. None of the children of men are natural branches of the &s;econd <HI>Adam, viz.</HI> Je&s;us Chri&s;t the true Vine; they are all the natural branches of the fir&s;t <HI>Adam,</HI> that degenerate vine; but the elect are all of them &s;ooner or later broken off from the natural &s;tock, and ingrafted into Chri&s;t the true Vine.</P>
<P>DOCT. <HI>They who are in the &s;tate of grace, are ingrafted in, and united to, the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> They are taken out of their natural &s;tock, cut off from it; and are now ingrafted into Chri&s;t as the new &s;tock. In handling of this, I &s;hall &s;peak to the <HI>My&s;tical Union,</HI> (1.) More generally. (2.) More particularly.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>A general View of the My&s;tical Union.</HEAD>
<P>FIRST, In the general, for under&s;tanding the union betwixt the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and his elect, who believe in him, and on him.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is a &s;piritual union. Man and wife, by their marriage-union, become one fle&s;h: Chri&s;t and true believers, by this union, become <HI>one &s;pirit,</HI> 2 Cor. vi. 17. As one &s;oul or &s;pirit actuates both the head, and the members, in the natural body; &s;o the one Spirit of God dwells in Chri&s;t and the Chri&s;tian; for, <HI>If any man have not the Spirit of Chri&s;t, he is none of his,</HI> Rom viii. 9. Corporal union is made by contract; &s;o the &s;tones in a building are united: but this is an union of another nature. Were it po&s;&s;ible we could eat the fle&s;h, and drink the blood of Chri&s;t, in a corporal and carnal manner; it would profit nothing, John vi. 63. It was not <HI>Mary</HI>'s bearing him in her womb, but her believing on him, that made her a &s;aint, Luke xi. 27, 28.

<P N="2">2. It is a real union. Such is our weakne&s;s in our pre&s;ent &s;tate, &s;o much are we immer&s;ed in &s;in, that we are prone to form in our fancy an image of every thing propo&s;ed to us; and as to what&s;oever is denied us, we are apt to &s;u&s;pect it to be but a fiction, or what has no reality. But nothing is more real, than what is &s;piritual; as ap|proaching neare&s;t to the nature of Him who is the fountain of all reality, namely, God him&s;elf. We do not &s;ee with our eyes the union betwixt our own &s;oul and body; neither can we repre&s;ent it to our&s;elves truly, by imagination, as we do &s;en&s;ible things: yet the reality of it is not to be doubted. Faith is no fancy, but the &s;ub&s;tance of things hoped for, Heb xi. Neither is the union thereby made betwixt Chri&s;t and believers, imaginary, but mo&s;t real: <HI>for we are members of his body, of his fle&s;h, and of his bones,</HI> Eph v. 30.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is a mo&s;t clo&s;e and intimate union. Believers, regenerate per&s;ons, who fiduciou&s;ly credit him and rely on him, have put on Chri&s;t, Gal. iii 27. If that be not enough, he is in them, John xvii. 23. formed in them, as the child in the mother's belly, Gal. iv. 19. He is the foundation, 1Cor iii 11. They are the lively &s;tones built upon him, 1 Pet ii. 5. He is the Head, and they the body, Eph. i. 22, 23. Nay, he liveth in them, as their very &s;ouls in their bodies, Gal. ii. 30. And, what is more than all this, they are one in the Father, and the Son, as the Father is in Chri&s;t, and Chri&s;t in the Father, John xvii 21. <HI>That they all may be one, as thou the Father art in me, and I in thee, they al&s;o may be one in us.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Though it is not a mere legal union, yet it is an union &s;u&s;tained in law. Chri&s;t as the cautioner, the Chri&s;tians as the principal debtors, are one, in the eye of the law. When the elect had run them&s;elves, with the re&s;t of mankind, in debt to the ju&s;tice of God; Chri&s;t became &s;urety for them, and paid the debt. When they believe on him, they are united to him in a &s;piritual marriage-union; which takes effect &s;o far, that what he did and &s;uffered for them, is reckoned in law, as if they had done and &s;uffered for them&s;elves. Hence they are &s;aid to be crucified with Je&s;us, Gal. ii. 20. Buried with him, Col. ii 12. Yea, rai&s;ed up together, (namely, with Chri&s;t) <HI>and made to &s;it together in heavenly places in Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</HI> Eph. ii. 6. In which places, &s;aints on earth, of whom the Apo&s;tle there &s;peaks, cannot be &s;aid to be &s;itting, but in the way of law-reckoning.</P>
<P N="5">5. It is an indi&s;&s;oluble union. Once in Chri&s;t, ever in him. Having taken up his habitation in the heart, he never removes. None can untie this happy knot. Who will di&s;&s;olve this union? Will he him&s;elf o it? No, he will not; we have his word for it: <HI>I will not turn away from them,</HI> Jer. xxxii. 40. But perhaps the &s;inner will do this mi&s;chief for him&s;elf; no, he &s;hall not, <HI>They &s;hall not depart from me, &s;aith their God,</HI> ibid. Can devils do it? No, unle&s;s they be &s;tronger

than Chri&s;t, and his Father too: <HI>Neither &s;hall any man pluck them out of my hand,</HI> &s;aith our Lord, John x. 28. <HI>And none is able to pluck them out of my Father</HI>'s <HI>hand,</HI> ver. 39. But, what &s;ay you of death, which parts hu&s;band and wife; yea, &s;eparates the &s;oul from the body? Will not death do it? No; the Apo&s;tle, Rom. viii. 38 39. is per|&s;uaded that neither death, (as terrible is it is) nor life, (as de&s;irable as it is) nor devils, tho&s;e evil angels, nor the devil's per&s;ecuting agents, tho' they be principalities or powers on earth; nor evil things pre&s;ent, already lying on us, nor evil things to come on us; nor the height of worldly felicity, nor depth of worldly mi&s;ery; nor any other creature, good or ill, <HI>&s;hall be able to &s;eparate us from the love of God, which is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us our Lord</HI> As death &s;eparated Chri&s;t's &s;oul from his body, but could not &s;eparate either his &s;oul or body from his divine nature; &s;o, tho' the &s;aints &s;hould be &s;eparated from their neare&s;t relations in the world, and from all their earthly enjoyments; yea, tho' their &s;ouls &s;hould be &s;eparate from their bodies, and their bodies &s;eparate in a thou&s;and pieces, their bones &s;cattered, as when one cutteth or cleaveth wood: yet &s;oul and body, and every piece of the body, the &s;malle&s;t du&s;t of it &s;hall remain united to the Lord Chri&s;t: for even in death, <HI>they &s;leep in Je&s;us,</HI> 1 The&s;&s;. iv. 14 And, <HI>he keepeth all their bones,</HI> P&s;al. xxxiv. 20 Union with Chri&s;t, is <HI>the grace wherein we &s;tand,</HI> firm and &s;table, <HI>as mount Zion, which cannot be removed.</HI></P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> It is a my&s;terious union. The go&s;pel is a doctrine of my&s;teries. It di&s;covers to us the &s;ub&s;tantial union of the three Per&s;ons in one Godhead, 1 John v 7. <HI>The&s;e three are one:</HI> the hypo&s;tatical union of the divine and human natures, in the per&s;on of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, 1 Tim iii. 16. <HI>God was manife&s;t in the fle&s;h:</HI> and the my&s;tical union, betwixt Chri&s;t and believers; this is a great my&s;tery al&s;o, Eph. v. 32. O what my&s;teries are here! the head in heaven, the members on earth, yet really united! Chri&s;t in the believer, living in him, walking in him: and the believer dwelling in God, putting on the Lord Je&s;us, eating his fle&s;h, and drinking his blood? this makes the &s;aints a my&s;tery to the world; yea, a my&s;tery to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>SECONDLY I come now more particularly to &s;peak of this union with, and ingrafting into Je&s;us Chri&s;t. And, (1.) I &s;hall con&s;ider the natural &s;tock, which the branches are taken out of (2.) The &s;upernatural &s;tock, they are ingrafted into. (3) What branches are cut off the old &s;tock, and put into the new. (4) How it is done. And, <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> The benefits flowing from this union and ingrafting.</P>

<P N="1">I. Let us take a view of the &s;tock, which the branches are taken out of. The two <HI>Adams,</HI> that is <HI>Adam</HI> and CHRIST, are the two &s;tocks: for the &s;cripture &s;peaks of the&s;e two, as if there had never been more men in the world than they, 1 Cor. xv. 45. <HI>The fir&s;t man
<PB N="168" REF="045042_0165_101F7EA6ABA1E818">
Adam was made a living &s;oul, the la&s;t Adam was made a quickning Spirit.</HI> Ver. 47. <HI>The fir&s;t man is of the earth, earthy: the &s;econd man is the Lord from heaven.</HI> And the rea&s;on is, there were never any, that were not branches of one of the&s;e two; all men being either in the one &s;tock or in the other; for in the&s;e two &s;orts all mankind &s;tands divided: Ver. 48. <HI>As is the earthy, &s;uch are they al&s;o that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> are they al&s;o that are heavenly.</HI> The fir&s;t <HI>Adam</HI> then is the natural &s;tock: on this &s;tock are the branches found growing at fir&s;t; which are afterwards cut off, and ingrafted into Chri&s;t. As for the fallen angels, as they had no relation to the fir&s;t <HI>Adam,</HI> &s;o they have none to &s;econd.</P>
<P>There are four things to be remembered here, (1.) That all mankind (the man Chri&s;t excepted) are naturally branches of the fir&s;t <HI>Adam,</HI> Rom. v. 12. <HI>By one man &s;in entered into the world, and death by &s;in: and &s;o death pa&s;&s;ed upon all men.</HI> (2.) The bond which knit us unto the natural &s;tock, was the covenant of works. <HI>Adam</HI> being our natural root, was made the moral root al&s;o; bearing all his po&s;te|rity as repre&s;enting them in the covenant of works. For, <HI>by one man</HI>'s <HI>di&s;obedience many were made &s;inners,</HI> Rom. v. 19 Now, there behoved to be a peculiar relation betwixt that one man and the many, as a foundation for imputing his &s;in to them. This relation did not ari&s;e from the mere natural bond betwixt him and us, as a father to his children; for &s;o we are related to our immediate parents, who&s;e &s;ins are not thereupon imputed to us as <HI>Adam</HI>'s &s;in is. It behoved then to ari&s;e from a moral bond betwixt <HI>Adam</HI> and us; the bond of a covenant, which could be no other than the covenant of works, wherein we were united to him as branches to a &s;tock. Hence Je&s;us Chri&s;t, though a &s;on of <HI>Adam,</HI> Luke iii 23, 38. was none of the&s;e branches; for &s;eeing he came not of <HI>Adam,</HI> in virtue of the ble&s;&s;ing of marriage, which was given before the fall, (Gen. i 28. <HI>Be fruitful and multiply,</HI> &amp;c.) but in virtue of a &s;pecial promi&s;e made after the fall, (Gen. iii. 15. <HI>The &s;eed of the woman &s;hall brui&s;e the &s;erpent</HI>'s <HI>head.) Adam</HI> could not repre&s;ent him in a covenant made before his fall. (3.) As it is impo&s;&s;ible for a branch to be in two &s;tocks at once; &s;o no man can be, at one and the &s;ame time, both in the fir&s;t and &s;econd <HI>Adam.</HI> (4) Hence it evidently follows, that all who are not ingrafted in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, are yet branches of the old &s;tock; and &s;o partake of the nature of the &s;ame. Now, as to the fir&s;t <HI>Adam,</HI> our natural &s;tock: Con&s;ider,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> What a &s;tock he was originally. He was a vine of the Lord's planting, a choice vine, a noble vine wholly a right &s;eed There was a con&s;ultation of the Trinity, at the planting of this vine, Gen. i. 26. <HI>Let us make man in our own image, often our own likene&s;s.</HI> There was no rottenne&s;s, at the heart of it. There was &s;ap and juice enough in it, to have nouri&s;hed all the branches, to bring forth fruit unto God. My meaning is, <HI>Adam</HI> was made able perfectly to keep the command|ments of God, which would have procured eternal life to him&s;elf, and
<PB N="169" REF="045042_0166_101F7EA998152170">
to all his po&s;terity; for &s;eeing all die by <HI>Adam</HI>'s di&s;obedience; all &s;hould have had life, by his obedience, if he had &s;tood. Con&s;ider,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> What that &s;tock now is: ah! mo&s;t unlike to what it was, when planted by the Author and Fountain of all good. A bla&s;t from hell, and a bite with the venomous teeth of the old &s;erpent, have made it a degenerate &s;tock, a dead &s;tock; nay, a killing &s;tock.</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>&s;t,</HI> It is a degenerate naughty &s;tock. <HI>Therefore the Lord God &s;aid to Adam,</HI> in that di&s;mal day, <HI>Where art thou?</HI> Gen iii 9. In what condition art thou now? How art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a &s;trange vine, unto me? Or, <HI>where wa&s;t thou?</HI> Why not in the place of meeting with me? Why &s;o long a-coming? What meaneth this fearful change, this hiding of thy&s;elf from me? Alas! the &s;tock is degenerate, quite &s;poiled, become altogether naught, and brings forth wild grapes. Conver&s;e with the devil is preferred to communion with God Satan is believed; and God, who is truth it&s;elf, di&s;believed. He who was the friend of God, is now in con&s;pi|racy again&s;t him. Darkne&s;s is come into the room of light: ignorance prevails in the mind, where divine knowledge &s;hone: the <HI>will,</HI> &s;ome|time righteous or regular, is now turned rebel again&s;t its Lord: and the whole man is in dreadful di&s;order.</P>
<P>Before I go further, let me &s;top and ob&s;erve, Here is a mirror both for &s;aints and &s;inners. Sinners, &s;tand here and con&s;ider, what you are: and &s;aints learn ye, what on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e ye were. Ye, &s;inners, are branches of a degenerate &s;tock. Fruit you may bear indeed; but now that your vine is the vine of <HI>Sodom,</HI> your grapes mu&s;t, of cour&s;e, be grapes of gall, Deut. xxxii. 32. The Scripture &s;peaks of two &s;orts of fruit, which grow on the branches upon the natural &s;tock: and it is plain enough, they are of the nature of their degenerate &s;tock. (1.) The <HI>wild grapes of wickedne&s;s,</HI> I&s;a. v. 2. The&s;e grow in abundance by influence from hell. See Gal. v. 19, 20, 21. At their gates are all manner of the&s;e fruits, both new and old. Storms come from heaven to put them back; but they &s;till grow. They are &s;truck at with the &s;word of the Spirit, the word of God: con&s;cience gives them many a &s;ecret blow: yet they thrive. (2) <HI>Fruit to them&s;elves,</HI> Ho&s;. x. 1. What el&s;e are all the unrenewed man's acts of obedience, his refor|mation, &s;ober deportment, his prayers, and good works? They are all done, chiefly, for him&s;elf, not for the glory of God. The&s;e fruits are like the apples of <HI>Sodom,</HI> fair to look at, but fall to a&s;hes, when handled and tried. Ye think ye have not only the leaves of a pro|fe&s;&s;ion, but the fruits of a holy practice too; but, if ye be not broken off from the old &s;tock, and ingrafted in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, God accepts not, nor regards your fruits.</P>
<P>Here I mu&s;t take occa&s;ion to tell you, there are five faults will be found in heaven, with your be&s;t fruits. (1.) Their bitterne&s;s; <HI>your clu&s;ters <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> bitter,</HI> Deut. xxxii. 32. There is a &s;pirit of bitterne&s;s, where with &s;ome come before the Lord, in religious duties, living in malice and envy; and which &s;ome profe&s;&s;ors entertain again&s;t others,
<PB N="170" REF="045042_0167_101F7EAB1ADA4868">
becau&s;e they out-&s;hine them, by holine&s;s of life, or becau&s;e they are not of their opinion or way. This, where&s;oever it reigns, is a fearful &s;ymptom of an unregenerate &s;tate. But, I do not &s;o much mean this, as that which is common to all the branches of the old &s;tock; namely, <HI>the leaven of hypocri&s;y,</HI> Luke xii. 1. which &s;owers and embitters every duty they perform. The wi&s;dom that is full of good fruits, is <HI>without hypocri&s;y,</HI> James iii. 17. (2.) Their ill &s;avour. Their works are abominable, for them&s;elves are corrupt, P&s;al. xiv. 1. They all &s;avour of the old &s;tock, not of the new; it is the peculiar priviledge of the &s;aints, that they are <HI>unto God a &s;weet &s;avour of Chri&s;t,</HI> 2 Cor. ii. 15. The unregenerate man's fruits &s;avour not of love to Chri&s;t&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of the blood of Chri&s;t, nor of the incen&s;e of his interce&s;&s;ion; and therefore will never be accepted of in heaven. (3.) Their unr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pene&s;s. <HI>Their grape is an unripe grape,</HI> Job xv. 33. There is no influence on them from the Sun of Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, to bring them to perfection. They have the &s;hape of fruit, but no more. The matter of duty is in them; but they want right principles and ends: their works are not wrought in God, John iii. 21. Their prayers drop from their lips, before their hearts be impregnate with the vital &s;ap of the Spirit of &s;up|plication: their tears fall from their eyes, ere their hearts be truly &s;oftened: their feet turn to new paths, and their way is altered; while yet their nature is not changed. (4.) Their lightne&s;s. Being weighed in the balances, they are found wanting, Dan. v. 27. For evidence whereof, you may ob&s;erve, they do not humble the &s;oul, but lift it up in prid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. The good fruits of holine&s;s bear down the branches they grow upon, making them to &s;alute the ground. 1 Cor. xv. 10 <HI>I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.</HI> But the bla&s;ted fruits of un|renewed men's performance, hang lightly on branches towering up to heaven, J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> xvii. 13. <HI>Now know I, that the Lord will do me good, &s;eeing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> to my prie&s;t.</HI> They look indeed &s;o high, that God cannot b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">id them: <HI>Wherefore have we fa&s;ted, &s;ay they, and thou &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t not?</HI> I&s;a. lviii. 3.

one word, their fruits are fruits of an ill tree, that cannot be accepted in heaven.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly,</HI> Our natural &s;tock is a dead &s;tock, according to the threat|ning, Gen. ii. 17 <HI>in the day thou eate&s;t thereof, thou &s;halt &s;urely die.</HI> Our root now is rottenne&s;s, no marvel the blo&s;&s;om go up as du&s;t. The &s;troke is gone to the heart; the &s;ap is let out, and the tree is withered. The cur&s;e of the fir&s;t covenant, like a hot thunder|bolt from heaven has lighted on it, and ruined it. It is cur&s;ed now as the fig-tree, Matth. xxi. 19. <HI>Let no fruit grow on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, henceforth for ever.</HI> Now it is good for nothing, but to cumber the ground, and furni&s;h fuel for <HI>Tophet.</HI></P>
<P>Let me enlarge a little here al&s;o. Every unrenewed man is a branch of a dead &s;tock. When thou &s;ee&s;t, O &s;inner, a dead &s;tock of a tree, exhau&s;ted of all its &s;ap, having branches on it in the &s;ame condition; look on it as a lively repre&s;entation of thy &s;oul's &s;tate. (1.) Where the &s;tock is dead, the branches mu&s;t needs be barren. Alas! the barrenne&s;s of many profe&s;&s;ors plainly di&s;covers on what &s;tock they are growing. It is ea&s;y to pretend to faith, but &s;hew me thy faith without thy works, if thou can&s;t, James ii. 17. (2.) A dead &s;tock can convey no &s;ap to the branches, to make them bring forth fruit. The covenant of works was the bond of our union with the natural &s;tock; but now it is become weak through the fle&s;h; that is, through the degeneracy and depravity of human nature, Rom vii. 3. It is &s;trong enough to command, and to bind heavy burdens on the &s;houlders of tho&s;e who are not in Chri&s;t; but it affords no &s;trength to bear them. The &s;ap that was once in the root, is now gone: and the law, like a mercile&s;s creditor, apprehends <HI>Adam</HI>'s heirs, &s;aying, <HI>Pay what thou owe&s;t;</HI> when, alas! his effects are riotou&s;ly &s;pent (3.) All pains and co&s;t are lo&s;t on the tree, who&s;e life is gone. In vain do men labour to get fruit on the branches, when there is no &s;ap in the root. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The gardiner's pains are lo&s;t: mini&s;ters lo&s;e their labour on the branches of the old &s;tock, while they continue in it. Many &s;ermons are preached to no purpo&s;e; becau&s;e there is no life to give &s;en&s;ation. Sleeping men may be awakened; but the dead cannot be rai&s;ed without a miracle: even &s;o, the dead &s;inner mu&s;t remain &s;o, if he be not re&s;tored to life, by a miracle of grace.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The influences of heaven are lo&s;t on &s;uch a tree: in vain doth the rain fall upon it: in vain is it laid open to the winter-cold and fro&s;ts. The Lord of the vineyard digs about many a dead &s;oul, but it is not bettered. <HI>Brui&s;e the fool in a mortar, his folly will not depart.</HI> Tho' he meets with many cro&s;&s;es, yet he retains his lu&s;ts: let him be laid on a &s;ick-bed, he will there ly like a &s;ick bea&s;t, groaning under his pain; but not mourning for, nor turning from his &s;in. Let death it&s;elf &s;tare him in the face; he will pre&s;umptuou&s;ly maintain his hope, as if he would look the grim me&s;&s;enger out of countenance. Sometimes there are common operations of the divine Spirit performed on him: he is &s;ent home
<PB N="172" REF="045042_0169_101F7EAE6E79EF18">
with a trembling heart; and with arrows of conviction &s;ticking in his &s;oul; but at length he prevails again&s;t the&s;e things, and turns as &s;ecure as ever. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> Summer and winter are alike to the branches of the dead &s;tock. When others about them are budding, blo&s;&s;oming, and bringing forth fruit; there is no change on them; the dead &s;tock has no growing time at all. Perhaps it may be difficult to know, in the winter, what trees are <HI>dead,</HI> and what are <HI>alive</HI>; but the &s;pring plainly di&s;covers it. There are &s;ome &s;ea&s;ons, wherein there is little life to be perceived, even among &s;aints; yet times of reviving come at length. But even when <HI>the vine flouri&s;heth, and the pomegranates bud forth</HI> (when &s;aving grace is di&s;covering it&s;elf, by its lively actings, where&s;oever it is) the branches on the old &s;tock are &s;till <HI>withered:</HI> when the <HI>dry bones</HI> are coming together, bone to bone, among&s;t &s;aints; the &s;inners bones are &s;till lying about the grave's mouth. They are trees that <HI>cumber the ground,</HI> are near to be cut down: and will be cut down for the fire, if God in mercy prevent it not by cutting them off from that &s;tock, and ingrafting them into another.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, Our natural &s;tock is a killing &s;tock. If the &s;tock die, how can the branches live?

<P>Know then, that every natural man is a branch of a <HI>killing</HI> &s;tock. Our natural root not only gives us not life, but it has a killing power reaching all the branches thereof. There are four things, which the fir&s;t <HI>Adam</HI> conveys to all his branches; and they are abiding in, and lying on, &s;uch of them as are not ingrafted to Chri&s;t. <HI>Fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t.</HI> A corrupt nature.

The &s;tock, as the &s;tock, (for I &s;peak not of <HI>Adam</HI> in his per&s;onal and private capacity) being cur&s;ed; &s;o are the branches.

by the cur&s;e. His <HI>pro&s;perity</HI> in the world <HI>de&s;troys him,</HI> Prov. i. 32. The mini&s;try of the go&s;pel is a <HI>&s;avour of death unto death,</HI> to him, 2 Cor. ii. 16. His &s;eeming attainments in religion are cur&s;ed to him: his knowledge &s;erves but to puff him up, and his duties to keep him back from Chri&s;t. (2.)

He teareth their enjoy|ments from them in his wrath, pur&s;ueth them with terrors, rents their &s;ouls from their bodies, and throws the deadhed branch into the fire. Thus the cur&s;e devours like fire, which none can quench. <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> This killing &s;tock tran&s;mits death to the branches upon it. <HI>Adam</HI> took the poi&s;onous cup, and drunk it off: this occa&s;ioned death to him&s;elf and us. We came into the world &s;piritually dead, thereby obnoxious to eternal death, and ab&s;olutely liable to tem|poral death. This root is to us like the <HI>Scythian</HI> river, which, they &s;ay, brings forth little bladders every day, out of which come certain &s;mall flies, which are bred in the morning, winged at noon, and dead at night: a very lively emblem of our mortal &s;tate.</P>
<P>Now, Sirs, is it not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to be <HI>broken off</HI> from this our <HI>natural</HI> &s;tock? What will our fair leaves of a profe&s;&s;ion, or our fruits of duties avail, if we be &s;till <HI>branches</HI> of the <HI>degenerate, dead</HI> and <HI>killing</HI> &s;tock? But, alas! among the many que&s;tions to&s;&s;ed among us, few are taken up about the&s;e,
<Q>Whether am I broken off from the old &s;tock, or not? Whether am I ingrafted in Chri&s;t, or not?</Q>
Ah! wherefore all this wa&s;te! Why is there &s;o much noi&s;e about religion among&s;t many, who can give no good account of their having laid a good foundation, being mere &s;tran|gers to <HI>experimental</HI> religion? I fear, if God do not, in mercy, timeou&s;ly undermine the religion of many of us, and let us &s;ee we have <HI>none</HI> at all; our root will be found rottenne&s;s, and our blo&s;&s;om go up as du&s;t, in a dying hour. Therefore, let us look to our <HI>&s;tate,</HI> that we be not found <HI>fools</HI> in our latter end.</P>
<P N="2">II. Let us now view the <HI>&s;upernatural</HI> &s;tock in which the branches, cut off from the <HI>natural &s;tock,</HI> are ingrafted. Je&s;us Chri&s;t is &s;ome|times called <HI>the branch,</HI> Zech. ii. 8. So he is, in re&s;pect of his human nature; being a branch, and the top branch of the hou&s;e of <HI>David.</HI> Sometimes he is called <HI>a root,</HI> I&s;a. xi. 10. we have both together, Rev. xxii. 16. <HI>I am the root, and the off-&s;pring of David</HI>: David's <HI>root,</HI> as God; and his <HI>off-&s;pring,</HI> as man. The text tells, that he is <HI>the Vine</HI>: he, as Mediator, is the <HI>vine-&s;tock,</HI> whereof believers
<PB N="174" REF="045042_0171_101F7EB48ADA4E18">
are the branches. As the &s;ap comes from the earth into the root and &s;tock, and from thence is diffu&s;ed into the branches; &s;o by Chri&s;t, as Mediator, divine life is conveyed from the fountain unto the&s;e who are united to him by faith, John vi 57 <HI>As the living Father hath &s;ent me, and I live by the Father: &s;o he that eateth me, even he &s;hall live by me.</HI> Now Chri&s;t is Mediator, not as God only, as &s;ome have a&s;&s;erted: nor yet as man only, as the Papi&s;ts gene|rally hold: but he is Mediator as God-man, Acts xx. 28 &mdash;<HI>The church of God, which he hath purcha&s;ed with his blood.</HI> Heb. ix 14. <HI>Chri&s;t, who, through the eternal Spirit, offered him&s;elf without &s;pot to God.</HI> The divine and human natures have their di&s;tinct actings, yet a joint operation in this, di&s;charging the office of a Mediator. This is illu&s;trated by the &s;imilitude of a fiery &s;word, which at once cuts and burns: cutting it burneth, and burning it cutteth; the &s;teel cuts, and the fire burns. Wherefore Chri&s;t, God-man, is the &s;tock, whereof believers are the branches: and they are united to whole Chri&s;t. They are united to him in his <HI>human nature,</HI> as be|ing <HI>members of his body, of his fle&s;h, and of his bones,</HI> Eph v. 30. and they are united to him in his <HI>divine nature;</HI> for &s;o the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks of this union, Col. i. 27. <HI>Chri&s;t, in you, the hope of glory.</HI> And by him they are united to the Father, and to the Holy Gho&s;t, 1 John iv. 15. <HI>Who&s;oever &s;hall confe&s;s that Je&s;us is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.</HI> Faith, the bond of this union, receives whole Chri&s;t, God-man: and &s;o unites us to him as &s;uch.</P>
<P>Behold here, O believers, your high privilege Ye were once branches of a <HI>degenerate</HI> &s;tock, even as others: but ye are, by grace, become branches of <HI>the true Vine,</HI> John xv. 1. Ye are cut out of a <HI>dead</HI> and <HI>killing</HI> &s;tock; and ingrafted <HI>in the la&s;t Adam, who was made a quickning Spirit,</HI> 1 Cor. xv. 45. Your lo&s;s by the fir&s;t <HI>Adam</HI> is made up, with great advantage, by your union with the &s;econd. <HI>Adam,</HI> at his be&s;t e&s;tate, was but a &s;hrub, in compari&s;on with Chri&s;t the tree of life. He was but a &s;ervant, Chri&s;t is the Son, the Heir, and Lord of all things, <HI>the Lord from heaven.</HI> It cannot be denied, that <HI>grace</HI> was &s;hown in the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> covenant: but it is as far exceeded by the grace of the <HI>&s;econd</HI> covenant, as the twilight is, by the light of the mid-day.</P>
<P N="3">III. What branches are taken out of the <HI>natural &s;tock,</HI> and grafted into this <HI>Vine? An&s;</HI> The&s;e are the elect, and none other. They, and they only, are <HI>grafted</HI> into <HI>Chri&s;t;</HI> and con&s;equently none but they are <HI>cut off</HI> from the <HI>killing</HI> &s;tock. For them <HI>alone</HI> he interceeds, <HI>that they may be one in him, and his Father,</HI> John xvii. 9, 23. Faith, the bond of this union, is given to none el&s;e: it is <HI>the faith of God</HI>'s <HI>elect,</HI> Tit. i. 1. The Lord pa&s;&s;ed by many branches growing on the natural &s;tock, and cuts off only here one, and there one, and grafts them into <HI>the true Vine,</HI> according as free love hath determined. Oft does he pitch upon the mo&s;t unlikely branch, leaving the top-boughs; pa&s;&s;ing by <HI>the mighty,</HI> and <HI>the

<HEAD>How the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ranches are taken out of the natural Stock, and ingrafted into the &s;upernatural Stock.</HEAD>
<P N="4">IV. I am to &s;hew how the branches are <HI>cut off</HI> from the natural &s;tock, the fir&s;t <HI>Adam,</HI> and grafted into <HI>the true Vine,</HI> the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Thanks to the hu&s;bandman, not to the branch, that it is cut off from its natural &s;tock, and ingrafted into a new one. The &s;inner, in his coming off from the fir&s;t &s;tock, is pa&s;&s;ive; and neither can nor will come off from it of his own accord; but clings to it, till almighty <HI>power</HI> make him to fall off, John vi 44. <HI>No man can come unto me, except the Father which hath &s;ent me, draw him.</HI> And chap. v. 40. <HI>Ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.</HI> The ingrafted branches are <HI>God's hu&s;bandry,</HI> 1 Cor. iii. 9 <HI>The planting of the Lord,</HI> I&s;a. lxi. 3. The ordinary means he makes u&s;e of in this work, is the mini&s;try of the word, 1 Cor. iii 9 <HI>We are labourers together with God.</HI> But the efficacy thereof is wholly from him, whatever the mini&s;ter's part or piety be, ver. 7. <HI>Neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth: but God that giveth the increa&s;e.</HI> The Apo&s;tle preached to the <HI>Jews,</HI> yet the body of that people remained in infidelity, Rom. x. 16. <HI>Who hath believed our report?</HI> Yea, Chri&s;t him&s;elf, who &s;poke as never man &s;poke, &s;aith concerning the &s;ucce&s;s of his own mini&s;try, <HI>I have laboured in vain, I have &s;pent my &s;trength for nought,</HI> I&s;a xlix. The branches may be hacked by the preaching of the word: but the &s;troke will never go through, till it be carried home on them, by an omnipo|tent arm. However God's ordinary way is, <HI>by the fooli&s;hne&s;s of preaching to &s;ave them that believe,</HI> 1 Cor i. 21.</P>
<P>The <HI>cutting off</HI> of the branch from the natural &s;tock, is performed by the prunning knife of the <HI>law,</HI> in the hand of the <HI>Spirit</HI> of God, Gal. ii. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">9. <HI>For I, through the law, am dead to the law.</HI> It is by the bond of the covenant of works, as I &s;aid before, that we are knit to our natural &s;tock: and therefore, as a wife, unwilling to be put away, plead<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and hangs by the marriage tie; &s;o do men by the
<PB N="176" REF="045042_0173_101F7EBC4454BFD8">
covenant of works. They hold by it, like the man who held the &s;hip with his hands; and when one hand was cut off, held it with the other; and when both were cut off, held it with his teeth This will appear from a di&s;tinct view of the Lord's work on men, in bring|ing them off from the old &s;tock&punc; which I now offer in the&s;e following particulars.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> When the Spirit of the Lord comes to deal with a per&s;on, to bring him to Chri&s;t; he finds him the <HI>Laodlee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI>'s ca&s;e, in a &s;ound &s;leep of &s;ecurity, dreaming of heaven and the favour of God tho' <HI>full of &s;in again&s;t the holy One of I&s;rael.</HI> Rev. iii 17. <HI>Thou know &s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> no that thou art wretched, and mi&s;erable, and poor, and blind, and naked.</HI> And therefore he darts in &s;ome beams of light into the dark &s;oul; and lets the man &s;ee he is a lo&s;t man, if he turn not over a new leaf, and betake him&s;elf to a new cour&s;e of life. Thus by the Spirit of the Lord, acting as a <HI>&s;pirit of bondage,</HI> there is a criminal court erected in the man's brea&s;t; where he is arraigned, accu&s;ed, and condemned for breaking the law of God, <HI>convinced of &s;in and judgment,</HI> John xvi. 8. And now he can no longer &s;leep &s;ecurely in his former cour&s;e of life. This is the fir&s;t &s;troke the branch gets, in order to cutting off.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Hereupon the man for&s;ake his former profane cour&s;es; his lying, &s;wearing, Sabbath-breaking, &s;tealing, and &s;uch like practices, though they be dear to him as right eyes, he will rather quit them, than ruin his &s;oul. The &s;hip is like to &s;ink, and therefore he throweth his goods over-board, that he him&s;elf may not peri&s;h. And now he begins to ble&s;s him&s;elf in his heart, and look joyfully on his evidences for heaven; thinking him&s;elf a better &s;ervant to God than many others, Luke xviii. 11. <HI>God, I thank that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unju&s;t, adulterers,</HI> &amp;c. But he &s;oon gets another &s;troke with the ax of the law, &s;hewing him that it is only he that <HI>doth</HI> what is written in the law, who can be &s;aved by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">; and that his negative holine&s;s is too &s;canty a cover from the &s;torm of God's wrath. And thus, although his &s;ins of commi&s;&s;ion only were heavy on him before: his &s;ins of <HI>omi&s;&s;ion</HI> now crowd into his thought<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, attended with a train of law-cur&s;es and vengeance. And c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the ter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> commands di&s;charges thunder-claps of wrath again&s;t him, for his <HI>omitting</HI> re|quired duties.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Upon this he turns to a po&s;itively holy cour&s;e of life. He not only is not profane, but he performs religious duties: he prays, &s;eeks the knowledge of the principles of religion, &s;trictly ob&s;erves the Lord's day, and, like <HI>Herod, does away things, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ars</HI> &s;ermons <HI>gladly.</HI> In one word, there is a great conformity in his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ard conver&s;ation, to the letter of both tables of the law. And now there is a mighty change upon the man, that his neighbours cannot mi&s;s to take notice of. Hence he is cheerfully admitted by the godly into their &s;ociety, as a praying per&s;on, and can confer with them about religious matters, yea, and about <HI>&s;oul-exerci&s;e,</HI> which &s;ome are not acquainted with. And their good opinion of him confirms his good
<PB N="177" REF="045042_0174_101F7EC094655040">
opinion of him&s;elf. This &s;tep in religion is fatal to many, who never get beyond it. But here the Lord reacheth the elect-branch a farther &s;troke. Con&s;cience flies in the man's face, for &s;ome wrong &s;teps in his conver&s;ation: the neglect of &s;ome duty, or commi&s;&s;ion of &s;ome &s;in, which is a blot in his conver&s;ation: and then the flaming &s;word of the law appears again over his head: and the cur&s;e rings in his ears, for <HI>cur&s;ed is he that continueth not in all things written in the law to do them,</HI> Gal. iii. 10.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> On this account he is obliged to &s;eek another &s;alve for his &s;ore. He goes to God, confe&s;&s;eth his &s;in; &s;eeks the pardon of it, promi&s;ing to watch again&s;t it for the time to come; and &s;o finds ea&s;e, and thinks he may very well take it, &s;eeing the &s;cripture &s;aith, <HI>If we confe&s;s our &s;ins&punc; he is faithful and ju&s;t to forgive us our &s;ins,</HI> 1 John i. 9. not con&s;idering that he gra&s;ps at a privilege, which is theirs only who are ingrafted into Chri&s;t, and under the covenant of grace; and which the branches yet growing on the old &s;tock cannot plead. And here &s;ometimes there are formal and expre&s;s vows made again&s;t &s;uch and &s;uch &s;ins, and binding to &s;uch and &s;uch duties. Thus many go on all their days; knowing no other religion but to do duties, and to confe&s;s, and pray for pardon of that wherein they fail; pro|mi&s;ing them&s;elves eternal happine&s;s, though they are utter &s;trangers to Chri&s;t. Here many elect ones have been ca&s;t down wounded, and many reprobates have been &s;lain; while the wounds of neither of them have been deep enough, to cut them off from their natural &s;tock. But the Spirit of the Lord gives yet a deeper &s;troke to the branch which is to be cut off; &s;hewing him, that, as yet, he is but an <HI>out-&s;ide &s;aint;</HI> and di&s;covering to him the filthy lu&s;ts lodged in his heart, which he took no notice of before, Rom vii. 9. <HI>When the commandment came, &s;in revived, and I died.</HI> Then he &s;ees his heart a dung-hill of helli&s;h lu&s;ts; filled with covetou&s;ne&s;s, pride, malice, filthine&s;s, and the like. Now, as &s;oon as the door of <HI>the chambers of his imagery</HI> is thus opened to him, and he &s;ees what <HI>they do there in the dark,</HI> his <HI>out-&s;ide</HI> religion is blown up as in&s;ufficient; and he learns a new le&s;&s;on in religion; namely, <HI>That he is not a Jew which is one outwardly,</HI> Rom. ii. 28.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> Upon this he goes further, even to <HI>in &s;ide</HI> religion; &s;ets to work more vigorou&s;ly than ever, mourns over the evils of his heart, and &s;trives to bear down the weeds he finds growing in that neglected garden. He labours to curb his pride and pa&s;&s;ion; and to bani&s;h &s;peculative impurities; prays more fervently, hears attentively, and &s;trives to get his heart affected in every religious duty he performs; and thus he comes to think him&s;elf not only an out&s;ide, but an <HI>in-&s;ide</HI> Chri&s;tian. Wonder not at this: for there is nothing in it beyond the power of nature, or what one may attain to under a vigorous in|fluence of the covenant of works. Therefore another yet deeper &s;troke is reached. The law chargeth home on the man's con&s;cience, thal he was a <HI>tran&s;gre&s;&s;or from the womb;</HI> that he came into the world a guilty creature: and that, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ints of his ignorance, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="178" REF="045042_0175_101F7EC3826C8B60">
even &s;ince his eyes were opened, he has been guilty of many actual &s;ins, either altogether overlooked by him, or not &s;ufficiently mourned over: (For &s;piritual &s;ores, not healed by the blood of Chri&s;t, but &s;kinned over &s;ome other way, are ea&s;ily ruffled, and as &s;oon break out again.) And therefore the law takes him by the throat, &s;aying, <HI>Pay what thou owe&s;t.</HI></P>

He renews his repentance, &s;uch as it is; bears patiently the afflictions laid upon him; yea, he afflicts him&s;elf, denies him&s;elf the u&s;e of his lawful comforts, &s;ighs deeply, mourns bitterly, cries with tears for a pardon, till he hath wrought up his heart to a conceit of having obtained it; having thus done pen|ance for what is <HI>pa&s;t,</HI> and re&s;olving to be a good &s;ervant to God, and to hold on in outward and inward obedience, for the time to <HI>come.</HI> But the &s;troke mu&s;t go nearer the heart yet, ere the branch fall off. The Lord di&s;covers to him, in the gla&s;s of the law, how he &s;inneth in all he does, even when he does the be&s;t he can; and therefore the dreadful &s;ound returns to his ears, Gal. iii. 10. <HI>Cur&s;ed is every one that continueth not in all things,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>When ye fa&s;ted and mourned,</HI> &s;aith the Lord, <HI>Did ye at all fa&s;t unto me, even to me?</HI> Will muddy water make clean clothes? Will you &s;atisfy for one &s;in with another? Did not your thoughts wander in &s;uch a duty? Were not your affec|tions flat in another? Did not your heart give a whori&s;h look to &s;uch an idol? And did it not ri&s;e in a fit of impatience under &s;uch an afflic|tion? <HI>Should I accept this of your hands? Cur&s;ed be the deceiver, which &s;acrificeth to the Lord a corrupt thing,</HI> Mal. i. 13, 14. And thus he becomes &s;o far broke off, that he &s;ees he is not able to <HI>&s;atisfy</HI> the demands of the law.</P>
<P><HI>Seventhly,</HI> Hence, like a broken man, who finds he is not able to pay all his debts, he goes about to compound with his creditor. And being in pur&s;uit of ea&s;e and comfort, he does what he can to fulfil the law; and wherein he fails, he looks that God will accept the <HI>will</HI> for the <HI>deed.</HI> Thus doing his duty, and having a will to do better, he cheats him&s;elf in a per&s;ua&s;ion of the goodne&s;s of his &s;tate: and hereby thou&s;ands are ruined. But the elect get another &s;troke, which loo&s;eth their hold in this ca&s;e. The doctrine of the law is born in on their con&s;ciences; demon&s;trating to them, that exact and perfect obedience is required by it, under pain of the cur&s;e: and that it is <HI>doing,</HI> and not <HI>wi&s;hing</HI> to do, which will avail. <HI>Wi&s;hing</HI> to do better will not an&s;wer the law's demands: and therefore the cur&s;e &s;ounds again, <HI>Cur&s;ed is every one that continueth not</HI>&mdash;to do <HI>them;</HI> that is, actually to <HI>do them.</HI> In vain is wi&s;hing then.</P>
<P><HI>Eighthly,</HI> Being broken off from hopes of compounding with the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w, he falls a <HI>borrowing.</HI> He &s;ees that all he can <HI>do</HI> to obey the law, and all his de&s;ires to <HI>be,</HI> and to <HI>do</HI> better, will not &s;ave his &s;oul: therefore he goes to Chri&s;t, intreating, that his righteou&s;ne&s;s may

make up what is wanting in his own, and cover all the defects of his doings and &s;ufferings; that &s;o God, for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, may accept them, and thereupon be reconciled. Thus doing what he can to fulfil the law, and looking to Chri&s;t to make up all his <HI>defects,</HI> he comes at length, again to &s;leep in a &s;ound &s;kin. Many per&s;ons are ruined this way. This was the error of the <HI>Galatians,</HI> which <HI>Paul,</HI> in his epi&s;tle to them, di&s;putes again&s;t. But the Spirit of God breaks off the &s;inner from this hold al&s;o: by bearing in on his con&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ience that great truth, Gal. iii. 12. <HI>The law is not of faith; but the man that doth them &s;hall live in them.</HI> There is no mixing of the law and faith in this bu&s;ine&s;s; the &s;inner mu&s;t hold by one of them, and let the other go: the way of the law, and the way of faith, are &s;o far different, that it is not po&s;&s;ible for a &s;inner to walk in the one, but he mu&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e off from the other: and if he be for <HI>doing,</HI> he mu&s;t <HI>do all alone;</HI> Chri&s;t will not do a <HI>part</HI> for him, if he do not all. A garment pieced up of &s;undry &s;orts of righteou&s;ne&s;s, is not a garment meet for the court of heaven. Thus the man, who was in a dream, and thought he was eating, is awakened by the &s;troke, and behold his &s;oul is faint; his heart &s;inks in him like a &s;tone; while he finds he can neither bear his burden him&s;elf alone, nor can he get help under it.</P>
<P><HI>Ninthly,</HI> What can one do, who mu&s;t needs pay, and yet neither has as much of his own as will bring him out of debt, nor can he get as much to borrow; and <HI>to beg he is a&s;hamed?</HI> What can &s;uch a one do, I &s;ay, but <HI>&s;ell him&s;elf,</HI> as the man under the law, that was <HI>waxen poor?</HI> Lev. xxv. 47. Therefore the &s;inner beat off from &s;o many holds, goes about to make a bargain with Chri&s;t, and to <HI>&s;ell him&s;elf</HI> to the Son of God, (if I may &s;o &s;peak) &s;olemnly promi&s;ing and vowing, that he will be a &s;ervant to Chri&s;t, as long as he lives, if <HI>he</HI> will &s;ave his &s;oul. And here oft-times the &s;inner makes a per&s;onal covenant with Chri&s;t, re&s;igning him&s;elf to him on the&s;e terms; yea, and takes the &s;acrament, to make the bargain &s;ure. Hereupon the man's great care is, how to obey Chri&s;t, keep his commands, and &s;o fulfil his bargain. And, in this the &s;oul finds a fal&s;e, unfound peace, for a while; till the Spirit of the Lord fetch another &s;troke, to cut off the man from this refuge of lies likewi&s;e. And that happens in this manner: When he fails of the duties he engaged to, and falls again into the &s;in he covenanted again&s;t; it is powerfully carried home on his con&s;cience, that his covenant is broken: &s;o all his comfort goes, and terrors afre&s;h &s;eize on his &s;oul, as one that has broken covenant with Chri&s;t, and commonly the man, to help him&s;elf, renews his covenant but breaks again as before. And how is it po&s;&s;ible it &s;hould be otherwi&s;e, &s;eeing he is &s;till upon the old &s;tock? Thus the work of many, all their days, as to their &s;ouls, is nothing but a making and breaking &s;uch covenants, over and over again.</P>

See I&s;a. lxi. 1, 2, 3. The go&s;pel is the &s;ilver cord let down from heaven, to draw peri&s;hing &s;inners to land. And, tho' the preaching of the <HI>law</HI> prepares the way of the Lord; yet it is in the word of the <HI>go&s;pel,</HI> that Chri&s;t and a &s;inner meet. Now, as in the natural grafting, the branch being <HI>taken up</HI> is <HI>put into</HI> the &s;tock; and being put into it, <HI>takes with</HI> it; and &s;o they are united: even &s;o in the &s;piritual ingrafting, Chri&s;t <HI>apprehends the &s;inner;</HI> and the &s;inner being apprehended of Chri&s;t, <HI>apprehends him;</HI> and &s;o they become one, Philip. iii. 12.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Chri&s;t <HI>apprehends</HI> the &s;inner by his <HI>Spirit,</HI> and draws him to him&s;elf, 1 Cor. xii 13. <HI>For by one Spirit, we are all baptized into one body.</HI> The &s;ame Spirit, which is in the Mediator him&s;elf, he com|municates to his elect in due time; never to depart from them, but to abide in them, as a principle of life. Thus, he takes hold of them, by his own Spirit <HI>put</HI> into them; and &s;o the withered branch gets <HI>life.</HI> The &s;oul is now in the hands of the <HI>Lord of life,</HI> and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the <HI>Spirit of life:</HI> how then can it but <HI>live?</HI> The man gets a ravi&s;hing light of Chri&s;t's excellency, in the gla&s;s of the go&s;pel: he &s;ees him a full, &s;uitable, and willing Saviour; and gets a heart to take him for, and in&s;tead of <HI>all.</HI> The <HI>&s;pirit of faith</HI> furni&s;heth him with feet to <HI>come</HI> to Chri&s;t, and hands to <HI>receive</HI> him. What by nature he could not do, by grace he can; the Holy Spirit working in him <HI>the work of faith with power.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The Sinner, thus apprehended, <HI>apprehends</HI> Chri&s;t by <HI>faith,</HI> and &s;o <HI>takes with</HI> the ble&s;&s;ed &s;tock, Eph. iii. 17. <HI>That Chri&s;t may dwell in your hearts by faith.</HI> The &s;oul that before tried many ways of e&s;cape, but all in vain, doth now <HI>look again,</HI> with the eye of faith, which proves the healing look. As <HI>Aaron's rod,</HI> laid up in <HI>the taber|nacle, budded, and brought forth buds,</HI> Numb. xvii. 8. So the dead branch <HI>apprehended</HI> by the Lord of life, <HI>put</HI> into, and <HI>bound</HI> up with, the glorious <HI>quickning &s;tock,</HI> by the <HI>Spirit</HI> of life, buds forth in actual <HI>believing on</HI> Je&s;us Chri&s;t, whereby this union is completed. <HI>We having the &s;ame &s;pirit of faith&mdash;believe,</HI> 2 Cor. iv. 13. Thus the &s;tock and the graft are united, Chri&s;t and the Chri&s;tian are <HI>married:</HI> faith being the &s;oul's con&s;ent to the &s;piritual marriage covenant, which, as it is pro|po&s;ed in the go&s;pel to mankind &s;inners indefinitely, &s;o it is demon|&s;trated, atte&s;ted, and brought home, to the man in particular, by the Holy Spirit: and &s;o be, being <HI>joined to the Lord, is one Spirit</HI> with him.

<P>USE From what is &s;aid, we may draw the&s;e following <HI>inferences:</HI></P>
<P N="1">1 The preaching of the <HI>law</HI> is mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary. He that would ingraft, mu&s;t needs u&s;e the &s;nedding knife. Sinners have many &s;hifts to keep them from Chri&s;t; many things by which they keep their hold of the <HI>natural &s;tock:</HI> therefore, they have need to be clo&s;ely pur&s;ued, and hunted out of their &s;culking holes, and refuge of lies.</P>
<P N="2">2. Yet it is the go&s;pel that crowns the work: <HI>the law makes nothing perfect<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"></HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he law lays open the wound, but it is the go&s;pel that heals. The law <HI>&s;trips a man, wounds him, and leaves him half-dead:</HI> the go&s;pel <HI>binds up his wounds, pouring in wine and oil,</HI> to heal them. By the law we are broken off: but, it is by the go&s;pel we are taken up, and implanted in Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>If any man have not the Spirit of Chri&s;t, he is none of his,</HI> Rom. viii 9. We are told of a mon&s;ter in nature, having two bodies differently <HI>animated,</HI> as appeared from contrary affections at one and the &s;ame time; but &s;o united, that they were &s;erved with the &s;elf|&s;ame legs Even &s;o, however men may cleave to Chri&s;t, <HI>call them|&s;elves of the holy city, and &s;tay them&s;elves upon the God of I&s;rael,</HI> I&s;a. xlvii 2. And they may be bound up as <HI>branches in him,</HI> John xv. 2. by the outward ties of &s;acraments: yet, if the <HI>Spirit</HI> that dwells in Chri&s;t, dwell not in them they are not one with him. There is a great difference betwixt <HI>adhe&s;ion</HI> and ingrafting. The <HI>ivy</HI> cla&s;ps and twi&s;ts it&s;elf about the oak; but it is not one with it, for it &s;till grows on its own root: &s;o, to alled<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> I&s;a. iv. 1. many profe&s;&s;ors <HI>take hold</HI> of Chri&s;t, <HI>and eat their own bread, and wear their own appar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l, only they are called by his name.</HI> They &s;tay them&s;elves upon him, but grow upon their own root: they take <HI>him</HI> to &s;upport their hopes, but their delights are el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P N="4">4. The union betwixt Chri&s;t and his my&s;tical members, is firm and indi&s;&s;oluble Were it &s;o that the believer only apprehended Chri&s;t, but Chri&s;t apprehended <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ot him: we could promi&s;e little on the &s;tabi|lity of &s;uch an union; it might quickly be di&s;&s;olved: but, as the believer apprehends Chri&s;t by faith; &s;o Chri&s;t apprehends him by his Spirit and none <HI>&s;hall pluck him out of his hand.</HI> Did the child only keep hold of the nur&s;e, it might at length weary and let go its hold, and &s;o fall away: but if &s;he have her arms about the child, it is in no hazard of falling away, even though it be not actually holden by her:
<PB N="186" REF="045042_0183_101F7EDF34A76A78">
&s;o, whatever &s;inful intermi&s;&s;ions may happen in the exerci&s;e of faith, yet the <HI>union</HI> remains &s;ure, by rea&s;on of the con&s;tant <HI>indwelling</HI> of the <HI>Spirit.</HI> Ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us! <HI>All his &s;aints are in thy hand,</HI> Deut. xxxiii. 3. It is ob&s;erved by &s;ome, that the word <HI>Abba,</HI> is the &s;ame, whether you read it forward or backward! whatever the believer's ca&s;e be, the Lord is &s;till to him <HI>Abba, Father.</HI></P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> They have an un&s;ure hold of Chri&s;t, whom he has not apprehended by his <HI>Spirit.</HI> There are many half-marriages here, where the &s;oul apprehends Chri&s;t, but is not apprehended of him. Hence many fall away, and never ri&s;e again: they let go their hold of Chri&s;t; and when that is gone, all is gone. The&s;e are <HI>the branches in Chri&s;t, that bear not fruit, which the hu&s;band-man taketh away,</HI> John xv. 2. <HI>Que&s;t.</HI> How can that be? <HI>An&s;.</HI> The&s;e branches are &s;et in the &s;tock, by a profe&s;&s;ion, or an un&s;ound hypocritical faith; they are bound up with it, in the external u&s;e of the &s;acraments: but the &s;tock and they are never knit; therefore they cannot <HI>bear fruit.</HI> And they need not be <HI>cut off,</HI> nor <HI>broken off;</HI> they are by the hu&s;band|man only <HI>taken away,</HI> or, (as the word primarily &s;ignifies) <HI>lifted up;</HI> and &s;o taken away, becau&s;e there is nothing to hold them: they are indeed bound up with the &s;tock; but they have never united with it.</P>
<P>Que&s;t, <HI>How &s;hall I know if I am apprehended of Chri&s;t? An&s;.</HI> You may be &s;atisfied in this inquiry, if you con&s;ider and apply the&s;e two things.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> When Chri&s;t apprehends a man by his Spirit, he is &s;o <HI>drawn,</HI> that he comes away to Chri&s;t with his <HI>whole heart:</HI> for true believing is <HI>believing with all the heart,</HI> Acts viii. 37. Our Lord's followers are like the&s;e who followed <HI>Saul</HI> at fir&s;t, <HI>men who&s;e hearts God has touched,</HI> 1 Sam. x. 26. When the Spirit <HI>pours in</HI> overcoming grace, they <HI>pour out their hearts like water before him,</HI> P&s;al. lxii. 8.

It is with the &s;oul, as with <HI>Noah</HI>'s dove; &s;he was forced back again to the <HI>ark,</HI> becau&s;e &s;he could find nothing el&s;e to re&s;t upon: but when &s;he did return, &s;he would have re&s;ted on the out &s;ide of it, if <HI>Noah</HI> had not <HI>put forth his hand, and pulled her in,</HI> Gen. viii. 9. The Lord &s;ends the avenger of blood in pur&s;uit of the criminal; and he, with a &s;ad heart, leaves his own city; and, with tears in his eyes, parts with his old acquaintance, becau&s;e he dare not &s;tay with them: and he frees for his life to the city of refuge. This is not at all his choice, it is forced work; <HI>nece&s;&s;ity has no law.</HI> But, when he comes to the gates, and &s;ees the beauty of the place, the excellency and love|line&s;s of it charms him; and then he enters it with heart and <HI>good|will,</HI> &s;aying, <HI>This is my re&s;t, and here I will &s;tay</HI>; and, as one &s;aid in another ca&s;e, <HI>I had peri&s;hed unle&s;s I had p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ri&s;hed.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> When Chri&s;t <HI>apprehends</HI> a &s;oul, the heart is di&s;engaged from, and turned again&s;t, <HI>&s;in.</HI> As in <HI>cutting off</HI> the branch from the old &s;tock, the great idol <HI>&s;elf</HI> is brought down, the man is powerfully taught to <HI>deny him&s;elf:</HI> &s;o, in the <HI>apprehending</HI> of the &s;inner by his Spirit, that union is di&s;&s;olved, which was betwixt the man and his lu&s;ts, while he was <HI>in the fle&s;h,</HI> as the Apo&s;tle expre&s;&s;es it. Rom. viii. 5. his heart is loo&s;ed from them, though formerly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s dear to him, as the members of his body; as his eyes, legs, or arms; and, in&s;tead of taking plea&s;ure in them as &s;ome time he did; he longs to be rid of them.

comprehends all the re&s;t as <HI>mediate</HI> ones.

<P>The <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> particular benefit that a &s;inner hath by his <HI>union</HI> with Chri&s;t is <HI>Ju&s;tification;</HI> for being united to Chri&s;t, he hath communion with him in his <HI>righte u&s;ne&s;s,</HI> 1 Cor. i. 30.

<P>Thus the per&s;on <HI>united</HI> to Chri&s;t, is ju&s;tified. You may conceive of the whole proceeding herein, in this manner.

<P>The <HI>&s;econd</HI> benefit flowing from the &s;ame &s;pring of <HI>union</HI> with Chri&s;t, and coming by the way of ju&s;tification, is <HI>Peace;</HI> peace with God, and peace of con&s;cience, according to the mea&s;ure of the &s;en&s;e the ju&s;tified have of their peace with God, Rom. v. 1.
<Q>Therefore being ju&s;tified by faith, we have peace with God.</Q>
Chap xiv. 27.
<Q>For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace, and joy in the Holy Gho&s;t.</Q>
Whereas God was their enemy before, now he is <HI>reconciled</HI> to them in Chri&s;t; they are in a covenant of peace with him; and as <HI>Abraham</HI> was, &s;o they are the <HI>friends</HI> of God. He is well-plea&s;ed with them, in his beloved Son. His word, which &s;poke terror to them formerly, now &s;peaks peace, if they rightly take up its language. And there is love in all his di&s;pen|&s;ations toward them, which makes all work together for their good: Their con&s;ciences are <HI>purg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d</HI> of that guilt and filthine&s;s that &s;ometime lay upon them: his con&s;cience purifying blood &s;treams through their &s;ouls, by virtue of their union with him, Heb. ix. 14.
<Q>How much more &s;hall the blood of Chri&s;t&mdash;purge your con&s;cience from dead works, to &s;erve the living God?</Q>
The bonds laid on their con|&s;ciences, by the Spirit of God, acting as the &s;pirit of bondage, are taken off, never more to be laid on by that hand, Rom. vii. 15.
<Q>For ye have not received the &s;pirit of bondage again to fear.</Q>
Hereby the con&s;cience is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> as &s;oon as the &s;oul becomes con&s;cious of the application of that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> which falls out &s;ooner or later, according to the trea&s;ure of faith, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the only wi&s;e God &s;ees meet to time it.

When the evil &s;pirit came upon <HI>Saul,</HI> he calls not for his Bible, nor for the prie&s;ts to conver&s;e with him about his ca&s;e; but for mu&s;ick, to play it away. So many, when their con&s;ci|ences begin to be unea&s;y, they fill their heads and hands with bu&s;ine&s;s, to divert them&s;elves, and to regain ea&s;e at any rate. Yea, &s;ome will &s;in over the belly of their convictions, and &s;o &s;ome get ea&s;e to their con&s;ciences, as <HI>Hazael</HI> gave to his ma&s;ter, by <HI>&s;tiffling</HI> him Again the performing of <HI>duties</HI> may give &s;ome ea&s;e to a di&s;quieted con&s;cience; and this is all that legal profe&s;&s;ors have recour&s;e to, for quieting of their con&s;ciences. When con&s;cience is wounded; they will pray, confe&s;s, mourn, and re&s;olve to do &s;o no more: and &s;o they become whole again, without any application of the <HI>blood</HI> of Chri&s;t, by <HI>faith.</HI> But they, who&s;e con&s;ciences are rightly quieted: come for <HI>peace</HI> and <HI>purging</HI> to <HI>the blood of &s;prinkling.</HI> Sin is a &s;weet mor&s;el, that makes God's elect &s;ick &s;ouls, ere they get it vomited up.

<P><HI>Elihu</HI> &s;hews us both the ca&s;e and cure, Job xxxiii. Behold the ca&s;e one may be in, whom God has thoughts of love to. He darteth convictions into his con&s;cience; and makes them &s;tick &s;o fa&s;t, that he cannot rid him&s;elf of them, ver. 16.

And thus Chri&s;t is &s;aid to declare God's name, P&s;al. xxii. 22. and to preach righteou&s;|ne&s;s, P&s;al. xl. 9. The phra&s;e is remarkable: it is not to &s;hew unto <HI>the man,</HI> but <HI>unto man,</HI> his righteou&s;ne&s;s; which not ob&s;curely inti|mates, that he is more than a man, who <HI>&s;hews;</HI> or <HI>declareth</HI> this righteou&s;ne&s;s.

<Q>He that formeth the mountains, and created the wind, and declareth unto man what is his thought.</Q>
There &s;eems to be in it a &s;weet allu&s;ion to the fir&s;t <HI>declaration</HI> of this righteou&s;ne&s;s <HI>unto man,</HI> or as the word is, <HI>unto Adam</HI> after the fall, while he lay under terror from apprehen&s;ions of the wrath of God: which declaration was made by the Me&s;&s;enger, the Interpreter, namely, the eternal word of the Son of God, called <HI>The voice of the Lord God,</HI> Gen. iii. 8. and by him appearing probably in human &s;hape.

<P>A <HI>Third</HI> benefit flowing from union with Chri&s;t, is <HI>Adoption.</HI> Believers, being united to Chri&s;t, become children of God, and mem|bers of the family of heaven. By their union with him, who is the Son of God by nature, they become the &s;ons of God by grace, John i. 12. As when a branch is cut off from one tree, and grafted in the branch of another; the ingrafted branch, by means of its union with the adopting branch (as &s;ome not unfitly have called it) is made a branch of the &s;ame &s;tock, with that into which it is ingrafted: &s;o &s;inners being ingrafted into Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who&s;e name is the <HI>Branch,</HI> his Father is their Father, his God their God, John xx. 17. And thus they, who are by nature children of the devil, become the children of God. They have the Spirit of adoption, Rom. viii. 15. namely, <HI>the Spirit of his Son,</HI> which bring them to God, as children to a father; to pour out their complaints in his bo&s;om, and to &s;eek nece&s;&s;ary &s;upply, Gal. iv. 6.
<Q>Becau&s;e ye are &s;ons, God hath &s;ent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.</Q>
Under all their weakne&s;&s;es, they have <HI>fatherly pity,</HI> and compa&s;&s;ion &s;hewn them, P&s;al. ciii. 13. <HI>Like as a father pitieth his children: &s;o the Lord pitieth them that fear him.</HI> Altho' they were but foundlings, <HI>found in a de&s;art land;</HI> yet now that to them belongs the adoption, <HI>he keeps them as the apple of his eye,</HI> Deut. xxxii. 10. Who&s;oever pur&s;ue them, they have a <HI>refuge,</HI> Prov. xiv. 26. <HI>His children &s;hall have a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of refuge.</HI> In a time of common calamity, they have chambers for <HI>protection,</HI> where they may be <HI>hid, until the indignation be overpa&s;s,</HI> I&s;a. xxvi. 20. And he is not only their refuge for <HI>protection,</HI> but their portion for provi&s;ion, in that refuge; P&s;al. cxlii. 5.
<Q>Thou art my refuge and my portion in the land of the living.</Q>
They are provided for, for eternity, Heb. xi. 16. <HI>He hath prepared for them a city</HI> And what he &s;ees they have need of for time, they &s;hall not want, Matth. vi. 31, 32.
<Q>Take no thought, &s;aying, What &s;hall we eat? Or, what &s;hall we drink? Or, wherewithal &s;hall we be clothed? For your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all the&s;e things.</Q>
<HI>Sea&s;onable correction</HI> is likewi&s;e their <HI>privilege as &s;ons:</HI> &s;o they are not &s;uffered to pa&s;s with their faults, as happens to others who are not children, but &s;ervants of the family, and will be turned out of doors for their mi&s;carriages at length Heb. xii. 7

<Q>But of him are ye in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who of God is made unto us wi&s;dom and righteou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;anctification.</Q>
Being united to Chri&s;t, they partake of his Spirit, which is <HI>the Spirit of holine&s;s.</HI> There is a <HI>fulne&s;s</HI> of the <HI>Spirit</HI> in Chri&s;t, and it is not like the fulne&s;s of a ve&s;&s;el, which only retains what is poured into it; but it is the ful|ne&s;s of a fountain for diffu&s;ion and communication, which is always &s;ending forth its water, and yet is always full. The Spirit of Chri&s;t, that &s;piritual &s;ap, which is in the &s;tock, and from thence is communicate to the branches, is <HI>the Spirit of grace,</HI> Zec. xii. 10: And where the Spirit of grace dwells, there will be found a com|plication of all graces. <HI>Holine&s;s</HI> is not one grace only, but all the graces of the Spirit: it is a con&s;tellation of graces; it is all the graces in their &s;eed and root. And as the &s;ap conveyed from the &s;tock into the branch, goes thro' it, and thro' every part of it; &s;o the Spirit of God &s;anctifies the <HI>whole man.</HI> The poi&s;on of &s;in was diffu&s;ed through the <HI>whole &s;pirit, &s;oul and body of the man;</HI> and &s;anctifying grace pur&s;ues it into every corner, 1 The&s;&s;. v. 23. Every <HI>part</HI> of the man is &s;anctified, though no part is perfectly &s;o. The truth we are &s;anctified by, is not <HI>held</HI> in the head, as in a pri&s;on: but runs, with its &s;anctifying influences, through <HI>heart</HI> and <HI>life.</HI> There are indeed &s;ome graces in every believer, which appear as top-branches above the re&s;t: as meekne&s;s in <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> patience in <HI>Job:</HI> but &s;eeing there is in every child of God, a holy principle going along with the holy law, in all the parts thereof, loving, liking, and approving of it; as appears from their <HI>univer&s;al</HI> re&s;pect to the commands of God: it is evident they are endued with <HI>all</HI> the graces of the Spirit; becau&s;e there can be no more in the effect, than there was in the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Now, this &s;anctifying Spirit, whereof believers partake, is unto them, (1.) A Spirit of <HI>mortification.</HI>
<Q>Through the Spirit they mortify the deeds of the body,</Q>
Rom. viii. 13. Sin is <HI>crucified</HI> in them, Gal v. 24.

Rom. vi. 5. At Chri&s;t's re&s;urrection, when his &s;oul was re-united with his body, every member of that ble&s;&s;ed body was enabled again to perform the actions of life: &s;o, the &s;oul being influenced by the &s;anctifying Spirit of Chri&s;t, is enabled more and more to perform all the actions of &s;piritual life. And as the whole of the law, and not &s;ome &s;craps of it only, is written on the holy heart; &s;o believers are enabled to tran&s;cribe that law in their conver&s;ation. And, although they cannot write one line of it without blots; yet God, for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, accepts of the performances, in point of &s;anctifi|cation: they being di&s;ciples to his own Son, and led by his own Spirit.</P>
<P>This &s;anctifying Spirit, communicated by the Lord Je&s;us to his members, is the &s;piritual nouri&s;hment the branches have from the Stock into which they are ingrafted; whereby the life of grace, given them in regeneration, is pre&s;erved, continued and actuated. It is the nouri&s;hment whereby the new creature liveth, and is <HI>nouri&s;hed</HI> up towards perfection. Spiritual life needs to be &s;ed, and mu&s;t have &s;upply of nouri&s;hment: and believers derive the &s;ame from Chri&s;t their head, whom the Father has con&s;tituted the head of influences to all his members, Col ii. 19.

Now, this &s;upply is, "the &s;upply of the Spirit of Je&s;us Chri&s;t," Phil i 19. The &s;aints &s;eed richly, eating Chri&s;t's fle&s;h, and drinking his blood, for their &s;piritual nouri&s;hment: yet our Lord him&s;elf teacheth us, that <Q>it is the Spirit that quickneth,</Q>
even <HI>that</HI> Spirit who dwells in that ble&s;&s;ed body, John vi 63. The <HI>human nature</HI> is united to the <HI>divine nature</HI>&punc; in the per&s;on of the Son, and &s;o (like the <HI>bowl</HI> in <HI>Zechariah</HI>'s candle&s;tick&punc; Zech. iv.) lies at the <HI>fountain-head,</HI> as the glorious means of conveyance of influences, from the fountain of the Deity; and receives not <HI>the Spirit by mea&s;ure,</HI> but ever hath a fulne&s;s of the Spirit, by rea&s;on of that <HI>per&s;onal union.</HI> Hence, believer being united to the man Chri&s;t, (as the <HI>&s;even lamps</HI> to <HI>the bowl,</HI> by their <HI>&s;even pipes,</HI> Zech. iv. 2.) his <HI>fle&s;h</HI> is to them <HI>meat indeed,</HI> and his <HI>blood drink indeed:</HI> for, feeding on that ble&s;&s;ed <HI>body</HI> (i.e. effectually app<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing Chri&s;t to their &s;ouls by faith) they partake more and more of that Spirit, who dwelleth therein, to their &s;piritual <HI>nouri&s;hment.</HI> The holine&s;s of God could never admit of an <HI>immediate</HI>

But the members of Chri&s;t on earth, are united to their head in heaven, by the invi&s;ible bond of the &s;elf-&s;ame <HI>Spirit</HI> dwelling in both: in him as the head, and in them as the members, even, as <HI>the wheels,</HI> in <HI>Ezeckiel</HI>'s vi&s;ion, were not <HI>contiguous to the living creatures,</HI> yet were united to them, by an invi&s;ible bond of one <HI>&s;pirit</HI> in both; &s;o that

<Q>The righteous &s;hall flouri&s;h like the palm-tree, he &s;hall grow like a Cedar in Lebanon,</Q>

Though the holy man be at fir&s;t a <HI>little child</HI> in grace, yet at length he becomes a <HI>young man, a father,</HI> 1 John ii. 13.

If a branch grafted into a &s;tock never grows, it is a plain evidence of its not having knit with the &s;tock.</P>
<P>But &s;ome may perhaps &s;ay, "If all true Chri&s;tians be growing ones, what &s;hall be &s;aid of the&s;e, who in&s;tead of growing, are going back?" I an&s;wer, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> There is a great difference between the Chri&s;tian's <HI>growing</HI> &s;imply, and his growing <HI>at all times.</HI> All true Chri&s;tians do grow, but I do not &s;ay, they grow at <HI>all times.</HI> A tree that has life and nouri&s;hment, <HI>grows</HI> to its perfection, yet it is not always growing; it grows not in the winter. Chri&s;tians al&s;o have their winters where|in the influences of grace, nece&s;&s;ary for growth, are cea&s;ed, Cant. v. 2. <HI>I &s;leep.</HI> It is by <HI>faith,</HI> the believer derives gracious influence from Je&s;us Chri&s;t; likeas each lamp in the candle&s;tick received oil from the bowl, by the <HI>pipe</HI> going betwixt them, Zech iv. 2. Now, if that pipe be &s;topt, if the &s;aints faithly dormant and unactive; then all the re&s;t of the graces will become dim, and &s;eem ready to be extingui&s;hed. In con&s;equence whereof, depraved nature will gather &s;trength, and become active. What then will become of the &s;oul? Why, there is &s;till one &s;ure ground of hope. The &s;aint's faith is not as the hypo|crite's, like a pipe laid &s;hort of the fountain, whereby there can be no conveyance: it &s;till remains a bond of <HI>union</HI> betwixt Chri&s;t and the &s;oul; and therefore, becau&s;e <HI>Chri&s;t lives,</HI> the believer <HI>&s;hall live al&s;o,</HI> John xiv. 19. The Lord Je&s;us <HI>puts in his hand by the hole of the door,</HI> and clears the means of conveyance: and their influences for growth flow and the believer's graces look fre&s;h and green again, Ho&s;. xiv. 7.
<Q><PB N="198" REF="045042_0195_101F7F01A69672D0">They that dwell under his &s;hadow &s;hall return: they &s;hall revive as the corn, and grow as the vine.</Q>
In the wor&s;t of times, the &s;aints have a <HI>principle</HI> of <HI>growth</HI> in them, 1 John iii. 9. <HI>His &s;eed re|maineth in him.</HI> And therefore after decays they revive again: namely when the winter is over, and <HI>the Sun of righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> returns to them with his warm influences.

(1.) By judging of their ca&s;e according to their pre&s;ent <HI>feeling.</HI> They ob&s;erve them&s;elves, and cannot perceive them&s;elves to be growing: but there is no rea&s;on thence to conclude they are not growing, Mark iv. 27.
<Q>The &s;eed &s;prings and grows up, he knoweth not how.</Q>
Should one fix his eye ever &s;o &s;tedfa&s;tly, on the &s;un running his race, or on a growing tree; he would not <HI>p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rceive</HI> the &s;un <HI>moving,</HI> or the tree <HI>growing:</HI> but, if he compare the tree as it now is, with what it was &s;ome years ago; and con&s;ider the place in the heavens, where the &s;un was in the morning; he will certainly perceive the tree has grown, and the &s;un has moved. In like manner may the Chri&s;tian know, whether he be in a growing or declining &s;tate, by comparing his pre&s;ent with his former condition (2) Chri&s;tians may mi&s;take their ca&s;e, by mea&s;ur|ing their growth by the advances of the top only, not of the root. Though a man be not growing taller, he may be growing &s;tronger. If a tree be taking with the ground, fixing it&s;elf in the earth, and &s;preading out its roots; it is certainly growing, although it be nothing taller than formerly. So, albeit a Chri&s;tian may want the &s;weet con&s;olation and fla&s;hes of affection, which &s;ometimes he has had; yet if he be growing in humility, &s;elf-denial, and &s;en&s;e of needy depend|ence on Je&s;us Chri&s;t, he is a growing Chri&s;tian, Ho&s;. xiv. 5.
<Q>I will be as the dew unto I&s;rael, he &s;hall ca&s;t forth his roots as Lebanon.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Que&s;t.</HI> <Q>But do hypocrites grow at all? And if &s;o, how &s;hall we di&s;tingui&s;h betwixt their growth, and true Chri&s;tian growth?</Q>
<HI>An&s;.</HI> To the fir&s;t part of the que&s;tion, hypocrites do grow. The <HI>tares</HI> have their growth, as well as the wheat: and the &s;eed that fell among thorns did <HI>&s;pring up,</HI> Luke viii. 7. only it did <HI>bring no fruit to perfection,</HI> ver. 14 Yea, a true Chri&s;tian may have a fal&s;e growth. <HI>James</HI> and <HI>John</HI> &s;eemed to grow in the <HI>grace of holy zeal,</HI> when their &s;pirits grew &s;o hot in the cau&s;e of Chri&s;t, that they would have fired whole villages, for not receiving their Lord and Ma&s;ter, Luke ix. 54
<Q>They &s;aid, Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, to con&s;ume them, even as Elias did?</Q>
But it was indeed no &s;uch thing; and therefore he turned and rebuked them, ver. 55.
<Q>and &s;aid, Ye know not what manner of &s;pirit ye are of.</Q>
To the &s;econd part of the que&s;tion, it is an&s;wered, that there is a peculiar beauty in <HI>true Chri&s;tian growth,</HI> di&s;tingui&s;hing it from all fal&s;e growth: it is univer&s;al, regular, proportionable. It is a
<Q>growing up to him in all things, which is the head,</Q>
Eph. iv. 15. The growing
<PB N="199" REF="045042_0196_101F7F0336BE8AA8">
Chri&s;tian grows proportionably in all the parts of the new man. Under the kindly influences of "the Sun of righteou&s;ne&s;s, believers "grow up as calves in the &s;tall, Mal. iv. 2. Ye would think it a mon&s;truous growth, in the&s;e creatures, if ye &s;aw their heads grow, and not their bodies, or if ye &s;aw one leg grow, and another not: if all the parts do not grow proportionably Ay, but &s;uch is the growth of many, in religion. They grow like rickety children, who have a big head, but a &s;lender body: they get more knowledge into their heads, but no more holine&s;s into their hearts and lives: They grow very hot outwardly, but very cold inwardly; like men in a fit of the ague. They are more taken up about the <HI>externals</HI> of religion, than formerly; yet as great &s;trangers to the power of godline&s;s as ever. If a garden is watered with the hand, &s;ome of the plants will readily get much &s;ome little, and &s;ome no water at all; and therefore &s;ome wither, while others are coming forward: but after a &s;hower from the clouds, <HI>all</HI> come forward together. In like manner all the graces of the Spirit grow proportionably, by the &s;pecial influences of divine grace. The branches ingrafted in Chri&s;t, growing aright, do grow in all the &s;everal ways of growth at once. They grow <HI>inward,</HI> growing <HI>into Chri&s;t,</HI> (Eph. iv. 15) uniting more clo&s;ely with him; and cleaving more firmly to him, as the head of influences, which is the &s;pring of all other true Chri&s;tian growth. They grow <HI>outward,</HI> in good works in their life and conver&s;ation. They not only, with <HI>Naphtali,</HI> give <HI>goodly words;</HI> but, like <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> they are <HI>fruitful bought.</HI> They grow <HI>upward</HI> in heavenly-mindedne&s;s, and contempt of the world; for their <HI>conver&s;ation is in heaven,</HI> Philip. iii 20. And finally, they grow <HI>downward</HI> in humility and &s;elf-lothing. The branches of the large&s;t growth in Chri&s;t, are in their own eyes, <HI>le&s;s than the lea&s;t of all &s;aints,</HI> Eph. iii. 8. <HI>The chief of &s;inners,</HI> 1 Tim i 15. <HI>More bruti&s;h than any man,</HI> Prov. xxx. 2. They &s;ee, they can do nothing, no not &s;o much as <HI>to think any thing, as of them&s;elves,</HI> 2 Cor iii 5 that they de&s;erve nothing, being

<P>A <HI>Sixth</HI> benefit is <HI>Fruitfulne&s;s.</HI> The branch ingrafted into Chri&s;t, is not barren, but brings forth fruit. John xv. 5.
<Q>He that abideth in me, and I in him, the &s;ame bringeth forth much fruit.</Q>
For that very end are &s;ouls <HI>married</HI> to Chri&s;t, that they may

Who&s;oever are united to Chri&s;t, bring forth the fruits of <HI>go&s;pel-obedience</HI> and true <HI>holine&s;s.

<P>If you a&s;k me, <HI>How your nouri&s;hment, growth and fruitfulne&s;s may be forwarded?</HI> I offer the&s;e few advices (1.) Make &s;ure work, as to your knitting with the &s;tock, by <HI>faith</HI> unfeigned; and beware of hypocri&s;y: a branch that is not found at the heart, will certainly wither. The trees of the Lord's planting are <HI>trees of righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> I&s;a. lxi. 3. So when others fade, they bring forth fruit. <HI>Hypocri&s;y</HI> is a di&s;ea&s;e in the <HI>vitals</HI> of religion, which will con&s;ume all at length. It is a leak in the &s;hip, that will certainly &s;ink it. <HI>Sincerity</HI> of grace will make it la&s;ting, be it never &s;o <HI>weak:</HI> as the &s;malle&s;t twig, that is found at the heart, will draw nouri&s;hment from the &s;tock, and grow, while the greate&s;t bough<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that is rotten, can never recover, becau&s;e it receives no nouri&s;hment. (2.) Labour to be &s;tedfa&s;t in the truths and way of God. An un&s;ettled and wavering judgment is a great enemy to Chri&s;tian growth and fruitfulne&s;s, as the Apo&s;|tle teaches, Eph. iv. 14, 15.
<Q>That we henceforth be no more children, to&s;&s;ed to and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine. But &s;peaking the truth in love, may grow up unto him in all things, which is the head, even Chri&s;t.</Q>
A rolling &s;tone gathers no fog, and a wavering judgment makes a fruitle&s;s life. Though a tree be never &s;o &s;ound, yet how can it grow, or be fruitful if ye be &s;till removing it out of one &s;oil into another? (3.) Endeavour to cut off the &s;uckers, as gardeners do that their trees may thrive. The&s;e are unmortified lu&s;ts. Therefore
<Q>mor|tify your members that are upon the earth,</Q>

<P>A <HI>&s;eventh</HI> benfit is, The <HI>acceptance</HI> of their fruits of holine&s;s be|fore the Lord. Though they be very imperfect they are <HI>accepted,</HI> becau&s;e they &s;avour of Chri&s;t the ble&s;&s;ed &s;tock, which the branches grow upon; while the fruits of others are rejected of God, Gen. ii. 4, 5.
<Q>And the Lord had re&s;pect unto Abel, and to his offering: But unto Cain and his offering he had not re&s;pect.</Q>

<Q>By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent &s;acrifice than Cain.</Q>
O how <HI>defective</HI> are the &s;aints <HI>duties</HI> in the eye of the law! The believer him&s;elf e&s;pies many faults in his be&s;t performances; yet the Lord graciou&s;ly receives them There is no grace planted in the heart, but there is a weed of corruption hard by its &s;ide, while the &s;aints are in this lower world. Their very <HI>&s;incerity</HI> is not without mixture of <HI>di&s;&s;imulation</HI> or <HI>hypocri&s;y,</HI> Gal. ii. 13. Hence there are defects in the exerci&s;e of <HI>every</HI> grace; in the performance of <HI>every</HI> duty: depraved nature always drops &s;omething to &s;tain their be&s;t works. There is &s;till a mixture of darkne&s;s with their cleare&s;t light. Yet this does not mar their acceptance, Cant. vi. 10.
<Q>Who is &s;he that looketh forth as the morning? <HI>or</HI> as the dawning?</Q>
Behold how Chri&s;t's &s;pou&s;e is e&s;teemed and accepted of her Lord, even when &s;he looks forth as the <HI>morning,</HI> who&s;e beauty is mixed with the <HI>blackne&s;s</HI> of the night! <HI>When the morning was looking out,</HI> as the word is, Judges xix. 26. <HI>i. e. in the dawning of the day,</HI> as we read it. So the very dawning of grace, and good-will to Chri&s;t, grace peeping out from under a ma&s;s of darkne&s;s in believers, is plea&s;ant and acceptable to him, as the break of day is to the weary traveller. Though the remains of unbelief make their hand of <HI>faith</HI> to &s;hake and tremble; yet the Lord is &s;o well plea&s;ed with it, that he employs it to carry away pardons and &s;upplies of grace, from the throne of grace, and the fountain of grace. His faith was effectual, who

Mark ix. 24. Tho' the remains of &s;en&s;ual affections make the flame of their love weak and &s;moaky; he turns his eyes from the &s;moak, and beholds the flame, how fair it is, Cant. iv. 10.
<Q>How fair is thy love, my &s;i&s;ter, my &s;pou&s;e! The &s;mell of their <HI>under</HI> garments <HI>of inherent holine&s;s, as imperfect as it is,</HI> is like the &s;mell of Lebanon,</Q>

A very ordinary work done <HI>in</HI> faith, and <HI>from</HI> faith, if it were but the building of a wall about the holy city, is <HI>a great work,</HI> Neh. vi. 3.

<Q>a cup of cold water only given to one of Chri&s;t's little ones, in the name of a di&s;ciple, &s;hall be rewarded,</Q>
Matth. x. 42. Nay, not a <HI>good word</HI> for Chri&s;t, &s;hall drop from their mouths but it &s;hall be regi&s;tred in God's <HI>book of remembrance,</HI> Mal. iii. 16.

<Q>For if there be fir&s;t a willing mind, it is accept|ed according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.</Q>
Their <HI>groanings,</HI> when they cannot well word their de&s;ires, are heard in heaven; the meaning of the&s;e groans is well known there, and they will be returned like <HI>the dove</HI> with an <HI>olive branch</HI> of peace in her mouth. See Rom. viii. 26, 27. Their mites are better than other mens talents. Their li&s;ping and broken &s;en|tences are more plea&s;ant to their Father in heaven, than the mo&s;t fluent and flouri&s;hing &s;peeches of tho&s;e that are not in Chri&s;t. Their <HI>voice is &s;weet,</HI> even when they are a&s;hamed it &s;hould be heard; their <HI>countenance is comely</HI> even when they blu&s;h, and draw a vail over it, Cant. ii. 14. The Mediator takes their petitions, blots out &s;ome parts, rectifies others, and then pre&s;ents them to the Father, in con&s;equence whereof they pa&s;s in the court of heaven.</P>
<P>Every true Chri&s;tian is a temple to God. If ye look for <HI>&s;acri|fices,</HI> they are not wanting there; they <HI>offer the &s;acrifice of prai&s;e,</HI> and they "do good; with &s;uch &s;acrifices God is well plea&s;ed," Heb. xiii. 15, 16. Chri&s;t him&s;elf is the <HI>altar</HI> that &s;anctifies the gift, ver. 10. But what comes of the &s;kins and dung of their &s;acrifices? They are carried away without the camp. If we look for incen&s;e, it is there too. The graces of the Spirit are found in their hearts: and the Spirit of a crucified Chri&s;t, fires them and puts them in exerci&s;e; likeas the fire was brought from the altar of burnt-offering, to &s;et the incen&s;e on flame: then they mount heaven-ward, <HI>like pillars of &s;moke,</HI> Cant. iii. 6. But the be&s;t of in|cen&s;e will leave a&s;hes behind it: yes indeed; but as the prie&s;t took away the a&s;hes of the incen&s;e in a golden di&s;h, and threw them out; &s;o our great High-prie&s;t takes away the a&s;hes and refu&s;e of all the &s;aints &s;ervices, by his mediation in their behalf.</P>

Indeed if a branch do not knit with the
<PB N="204" REF="045042_0201_101F7F0FCC6E4BF8">
&s;tock, it will fall away when &s;haking winds ari&s;e: but the branch knit to the &s;tock &s;tands fa&s;t, whatever winds blows. Sometimes a &s;tormy wind of <HI>temptation</HI> blows from hell, and to&s;&s;eth the branches in Chri&s;t the <HI>true vine:</HI> but their union with him, is their &s;ecurity; <HI>moved</HI> they may be, but <HI>removed</HI> they never can be. The Lord "will with the temptation al&s;o make a way to e&s;cape," 1 Cor. x. 13. Calms are never of any continuance: there is almo&s;t always &s;ome wind blowing; and therefore branches are rarely altogether at re&s;t. But &s;ometimes violent winds ari&s;e, which threaten to rend them from off their &s;tock. Even &s;o it is with &s;aints; they are daily put to it, to keep their ground again&s;t temptation: but &s;ometimes the wind from hell ri&s;eth &s;o high, and bloweth &s;o furi|ou&s;ly, that it makes even top-branches to &s;weep the ground; yet being knit to Chri&s;t their &s;tock, they get up again, in &s;pite of the mo&s;t violent efforts of the <HI>prince of the power of the air,</HI> P&s;al. xciv. 18. "When I &s;aid my foot &s;lippeth, thy mercy, O Lord, held me up." But the Chri&s;tian improves by this trial; and is &s;o far from being damaged, that he is benefited by it, in &s;o far as it di&s;covers what hold the &s;oul has of Chri&s;t, and what hold Chri&s;t has of the &s;oul. And lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k as the wind in the billows, which would blow out the candle, blows up the <HI>fire:</HI> even &s;o it often comes to pa&s;s that &s;uch temptations do enliven the true Chri&s;tian, awakening the graces of the Spirit in him; and by that means, di&s;cover both the <HI>reality,</HI> and the <HI>&s;trength</HI> of grace in him. And hence, as <HI>Luther,</HI> that great man of God, &s;aith,
<Q>One Chri&s;tian who hath had ex|perience of temptation, is worth a thou&s;and others</Q></P>
<P>Sometimes a &s;tormy wind of <HI>trouble</HI> and <HI>per&s;ecution</HI> from the men of the world, blows upon <HI>the vine, i. e</HI> my&s;tical Chri&s;t: but union with the &s;tock is a &s;ufficient &s;ecurity to the branches. In a time of the church's peace and outward pro&s;perity, while <HI>the ang<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ls hold the winds that they blow not,</HI> there are a great many branches taken up, and put into the &s;tock, which never <HI>knit</HI> with it, nor live by it, though they be bound up with it, by the bonds of external ordinances. Now the&s;e may &s;tand a while on the &s;tock; and &s;tand with great ea&s;e, while the calm la&s;ts. But when once the &s;torms ari&s;e, and the winds blow; they will begin to fall off, one after another: and the higher the wind ri&s;eth, the greater will the number be that falls. Yea &s;ome &s;trong boughs of that &s;ort, when they fall, will, by their weight, carry others of their own kind, quite down to the <HI>earth</HI> with them; and will brui&s;e and pre&s;s down &s;ome true branches in &s;uch a manner, that they would al&s;o fall off, were it not for their being <HI>knit</HI> to the &s;tock; in virtue whereof they get up their heads again, and cannot fall off&punc; becau&s;e of that fa&s;t hold the &s;tock has of them. Then it is that many bran|ches, &s;ometime high and eminent, are found lying on the earth wi|thered, and fit to be gathered up and ca&s;t into the fire, Matth. xiii. 6.</P>

<Q>When thou pa&s;&s;e&s;t through the waters, I will be with thee: and through the rivers, they &s;hall not overflow thee.</Q>
See how <HI>David</HI> was &s;upported under a heavy load, 1 Sam. xxx. 6. His city <HI>Ziklag</HI> was burnt, his wives were taken captives, his men &s;poke of &s;toning him; nothing was left him but his God and his faith; but by his faith he encouraged him&s;elf in his God. The Lord comes and lays his cro&s;s on his people's &s;houlders; it pre&s;&s;eth them down; they are like to &s;ink under it, and therefore cry, "Ma&s;ter, &s;ave us, we peri&s;h:" but he <HI>&s;upports</HI> them under their burden; he bears <HI>them</HI> up, and they bear their <HI>cro&s;s.</HI> Thus the Chri&s;tian having a weight of outward troubles upon him, goes lightly under his burden, having withal the
<Q>everla&s;ting arms underneath him.</Q>
The Chri&s;tian has a &s;pring of comfort, which he cannot lo&s;e; and therefore never wants &s;omething to &s;upport him. If one have all his riches in money, robbers may take the&s;e away; and then <HI>what has he more?</HI> But though the landed man be robbed of his <HI>money,</HI> yet his lands remain for his &s;upport. They that build their comfort on worldly goods, may quickly be comfortle&s;s: but they that are united to Chri&s;t, &s;hall find comfort when all the &s;treams of worldly enjoyments are dried up, Job vi. 13.

<P N="2">2<HI>dly,</HI> Chri&s;t &s;upports his people under a <HI>weight</HI> of inward troubles and di&s;couragements. Many times "heart and fle&s;h fail them," but then, "God is the &s;trength of their heart," P&s;al. lxxiii. 26. They may have <HI>a weight of guilt</HI> pre&s;&s;ing them. This is a load that will make their back to &s;toop, and the &s;pirits to &s;ink: but he takes it off, and puts a pardon in their hand, while they ca&s;t their burden over upon him. Chri&s;t takes the &s;oul, as one marries a widow, under a burden of debt: and &s;o when the creditors come to Chri&s;t's &s;pou&s;e, &s;he carries them to her hu&s;band, confe&s;&s;eth the debt, declares &s;he is not able to pay, and lays all over upon him. The Chri&s;tian &s;ome|times, through carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, lo&s;eth his di&s;charge; he cannot find it,
<PB N="207" REF="045042_0204_101F7F1920F56C78">
however he &s;earch for it. The law takes that opportunity; and bends up a proce&s;s again&s;t him for a debt paid already. God hides his face, and the &s;oul is di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. Many arrows go through the heart now; many long accounts are laid before the man, which he reads and acknowledges. Often does he &s;ee the officers coming to apprehend him, and the pri&s;on door open to receive him. What el&s;e keeps him from &s;inking utterly under di&s;couragements in this ca&s;e, but that the everla&s;ting arms of a Mediator are underneath him, and that he relies upon the great Cautioner? Further, they may have a weight of &s;trong lu&s;ts pre&s;&s;ing them. They have a body of death upon them. Death is a weight that pre&s;&s;eth the &s;oul out of the body. A leg or an arm of death (if I may &s;o &s;peak) would be a terrible load. (One lively lu&s;t will &s;ometimes ly &s;o heavy on a child of God, that he can no more remove it, than a child could throw a giant from off him.) How then are they &s;upported under a whole body of death? Why, their &s;upport is from the root that bears them, from the everla&s;ting arm that is underneath them. His grace is &s;ufficient for them, 2 Cor. xiii. 9. The great &s;tay of the believer is not the grace of God <HI>within him,</HI> that is a well, who&s;e &s;treams &s;ometimes run dry: but it is the grace of God <HI>without him,</HI> the grace that is in Je&s;us Chri&s;t; which is an ever-flowing fountain, to which the believer can never come ami&s;s. For the Apo&s;tle tells us in the &s;ame ver&s;e, it is the power of Chri&s;t. "Mo&s;t gladly therefore," &s;aith he,
<Q>will I rather glory in my in|infirmities, that the power of Chri&s;t may re&s;t upon me, or taber|nacle above me,</Q>
as the cloud of glory did on the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> which God &s;pread for a covering, or &s;helter to them in the wilderne&s;s, P&s;al. cv. 39. compare I&s;a. iv. 5, 6. So that the believer in this combat, like the eagle, fir&s;t flies aloft (by faith) and then comes down on the prey, P&s;al. xxxiv. 5.
<Q>They looked to him, and were lightened.</Q>
And finally, they have <Q>a weight of weakne&s;s and wants upon them,</Q>
but they
<Q>ca&s;t over that burden on the Lord their &s;trength, and he &s;u&s;tains them,</Q>
P&s;al. lv. 22. With all their wants and weakne&s;&s;es, they are ca&s;t upon him; as the poor, weak and naked babe, coming out of the womb, is ca&s;t into the lap of one appointed to take care of it, P&s;al. xxii. 10. Though they be de&s;titute (as a &s;hrub in the wilderne&s;s, which the foot of every bea&s;t may tread down) the Lord will regard them, P&s;al. cii. 17. It is no marvel, the weake&s;t plant may be &s;afe in a garden: but our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t is a hedge for protection to his weak and de&s;titute ones, even in a wilderne&s;s.</P>

<Q>But if the &s;aints be &s;upported, how is it that they fall &s;o often under temptation and di&s;couragements?</Q>
<HI>An&s;.</HI> (1.) How long &s;oever they fall at any time, they never <HI>fall off;</HI> and that is a great matter. They "are kept by the power of of God through faith unto &s;alvation," 1 Pet. i. 5. Hypocrites may &s;o fall, &s;o as to fall off, and fall into the pit, as a bucket falls into a well when the chain breaks. But though the child of God may fall, and that &s;o

low, as <HI>the water goes over his head;</HI> yet there is &s;till a bond of union betwixt Chri&s;t and him: the cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n is not broken: he will not go to the ground: he will be drawn up again, Luke xxii. 31, 32.
<Q>And the Lord &s;aid, Simon, Simon, Satan hath de&s;ired to have you, that he may &s;ift you as wheat; but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not.</Q>
(2.) The falls of the &s;aints flow from their not improving their union with Chri&s;t, their not making u&s;e of him by faith, for &s;taying or bearing them up, P&s;al. xxvi. 13. "I had fainted, unle&s;s I had believed." While the nur&s;e holds the child in her arms, it cannot fall to the ground: yet if the unwary child hold not by her, it may fall backwards in her arms to its great hurt. Thus <HI>David</HI>'s fall broke his <HI>bones</HI>&punc; P&s;al. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> 8. but it did not break the bond of union betwixt Chri&s;t and him: The <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> the bond of that union, was <HI>not taken</HI> from him, ver. 11.</P>
<P>The <HI>La&s;t</HI> benefit I &s;hall name, is, <HI>The &s;pecial care of the hu&s;band|man,</HI> John xv. 1, 2.
<Q>I am the true vine, and my Father is the hu&s;bandman.&mdash;Every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.</Q>
Believers, by virtue of their union with Chri&s;t, are the object of God's &s;pecial care and provi|dence. My&s;tical Chri&s;t is God's <HI>vine,</HI> other &s;ocieties in the world are but <HI>wild olive trees.</HI> The men of the world are but God's out|field; the &s;aints are his <HI>vineyard,</HI> which he has a &s;pecial propriety in, and a &s;pecial concern for, Cant. viii. 12.
<Q>My vineyard, which is mine, is before me.</Q>
He that &s;lumbers not, nor &s;leeps, is the keeper of it, he
<Q>does keep it le&s;t any hurt it, he will keep it night and day:</Q>
he in who&s;e hand is the dew of heaven,
<Q>will water it every moment,</Q>
I&s;a. xxvii. 3. He dre&s;&s;eth and <HI>purgeth it,</HI> in order to further fruitfulne&s;s, John xv. 2. He cuts off the luxuri|ant twigs that mar the fruitfulne&s;s of the branch. This is done, e&s;pcially by the <HI>word,</HI> and by the <HI>cro&s;s</HI> of afflictions. The &s;aints need the mini&s;try of the word, as much as the vineyard needeth one to dre&s;s and prune the vines, 1 Cor. iii. 9.
<Q>We are labour|ers togethers with God: ye are God's hu&s;bandry, ye are God's building.</Q>
And they <HI>need</HI> the cro&s;s too, 1 Pet. i. 6.</P>
<P>And therefore, if we &s;hould reckon the <HI>cro&s;s</HI> among&s;t the <HI>benefits</HI> flowing to believers from their union with Chri&s;t. I judge, we &s;hould not reckon it ami&s;s. Sure I am. in their &s;ufferings they <HI>&s;uffer with him,</HI> Rom. viii. 17. And the a&s;&s;urances they have of the cro&s;s, have rather the nature of a <HI>promi&s;e,</HI> as of a <HI>threatning,</HI> P&s;al. lxxxix. 30.31.32.33.
<Q>If his children for&s;ake my law,&mdash;then will I vi&s;it their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion with the rod, and their iniquity with &s;tripes. Neverthele&s;s, my loving kindne&s;s will I not ut|terly take from him: nor &s;uffer thy faithfulne&s;s to fail.</Q>
This looks like a tutor's engaging to a dying father, to take care of the children left upon him; and to give them both nurture and admo|nition, for their good. The covenant of grace does truly beat <HI>the &s;pears</HI> of affliction into <HI>pruning hooks,</HI> to them that are in Chri&s;t,

<Q>That no hi&s;tory makes mention of any man, who hath been made better by riches.</Q>
I doubt if our modern hi&s;tories can &s;upply the defect of ancient hi&s;tories in this point. But &s;ure I am many have been the wor&s;e of riches: thou&s;ands have been hugged to death, in the embraces of a &s;miling world; and many good men have got wounds from outward pro&s;perity, that behoved to be cured by the cro&s;s. I remember to have read of one, who having an impo&s;thume in his brea&s;t, had in vain u&s;ed the help of phy&s;icians: but being wound|ed with a &s;word, the impo&s;thume broke; and his life was &s;aved by that accident, which threatned immediate death.

<Q><BIBL>JOB xxx. 23.</BIBL>
<P>For I know that thou wilt bring me to Death, and to the Hou&s;e appointed for all Living.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>I Come now to di&s;cour&s;e of man's eternal <HI>&s;tate,</HI> into which he enters by <HI>death.</HI> Of this entrance, <HI>Job</HI> takes a &s;olemn &s;erious view, in the words of the text; which contain a general truth, and a particular application of it. The general truth is &s;uppo&s;ed; namely, that all men mu&s;t, by <HI>death,</HI> remove out of this world: they mu&s;t die. But, whither mu&s;t they go? They mu&s;t go <HI>to the hou&s;e appointed for all living:</HI> to the grave, that dark&s;ome, gloomy, &s;olitary hou&s;e, in the land of forgetfulne&s;s. Where&s;oever the body is laid up, till the re&s;urrection; thither, as to a <HI>dwelling-hou&s;e,</HI> death brings us home. While we are in the body, we are but in a <HI>lodging-hou&s;e:</HI> in an inn, on our way home-ward. When we come to our grave, we come to our <HI>home,</HI> our <HI>long-home,</HI> Eccle&s;. xii. 5. <HI>All living</HI> mu&s;t be inhabi|tants of this hou&s;e, good and bad, old and young. Man's life is a &s;tream, running into death's devouring deeps. They, who now live in palaces, mu&s;t quit them, and go home to this <HI>hou&s;e;</HI> and they, who have not where to lay their heads, &s;hall thus have a <HI>hou&s;e</HI> at length. It is <HI>appointed for all</HI> by him, who&s;e coun&s;el &s;hall &s;tand This ap|pointment cannot be &s;hifted; it is a law, which mortals cannot tran&s;|gre&s;s. <HI>Job</HI>'s application of this general truth to him&s;elf, is expre&s;&s;ed in the&s;e words: <HI>I know that thou wilt bring me to death,</HI> &amp;c He knew, that he behoved to meet with death; that his &s;oul and body behoved to part; that, God, who had &s;et the try&s;t, would certainly &s;ee it kept. Sometimes <HI>Job</HI> was inviting death to come to him, and carry him home to his hou&s;e; yea, he was in hazard of <HI>running</HI> to it

Whereby he &s;eems to intimate, that we have no life in this world, but as runaways from death, which &s;tretcheth out its cold arms, to receive us from the womb; but though we do then narrowly e&s;cape its clutches, we cannot e&s;cape long; we will be <HI>brought back again</HI> to it. <HI>Job</HI> knew this, he had laid his account with it, and was looking for it.</P>

There is no <HI>peradventure</HI> in it; <HI>we mu&s;t needs die,</HI> 2 Sam. xiv. 14. Though &s;ome men will not <HI>hear</HI> of death, yet every man mu&s;t <HI>&s;ee death,</HI> P&s;al. lxxxix. 48.

Though the lamp of our life be not violently blown out; yet the flame mo&s;t go out at length, for want of oil.

Howbeit, &s;ome are &s;natched away in a moment, without being warned by &s;ickne&s;s or di&s;ea&s;e. <HI>Fourthly,</HI> We have <HI>&s;inful</HI> &s;ouls, and therefore have <HI>dying</HI> bodies: death fol|lows &s;in, as the &s;hadow follows the body. The wicked mu&s;t die, by virtue of the threatning of the covenant of works, Gen. ii. 17. "In the day that thou eate&s;t thereof, thou &s;halt &s;urely die." And the godly mu&s;t die too; that, as death entered by &s;in, &s;in may go out by death. Chri&s;t has taken away the <HI>&s;ting</HI> of death, as to them; albeit he has not as yet removed death it&s;elf.

&s;u&s;pect afflicted <HI>Job</HI> of partiality in this matter, hear the wi&s;e and pro&s;perous <HI>Solomon's</HI> character of the days of his life, Eccle&s; viii. 15. <HI>All things have I &s;een in the days of my vanity,</HI> i. e. <HI>my vain days. Mo&s;es,</HI> who was a very active man compares our days to <HI>a &s;leep,</HI> P&s;al. xc. 5 <HI>They are as a &s;leep,</HI> which is not noticed, till it be ended. The re&s;emblance is pat: few men have right apprehen&s;ions of life, until death awaken them; then we begin to know we <HI>were</HI> living. <HI>We &s;pend our years as a tale that is told,</HI> ver. 9 When an idle tale is a-telling, it may affect a little; but when it is ended, it is forgot: and &s;o is man forgotten, when the fable of his life is ended. It is as <HI>a dream,</HI> or <HI>vi&s;ion of the night,</HI> in which there is nothing &s;olid: when one awakes, all evani&s;heth, Job xx. 8.
<Q>He &s;hall fly away as a dream, and &s;hall not be found; yea he &s;hall be cha&s;ed away as a vi&s;ion of the night.</Q>
It is but a vain &s;how or <HI>image,</HI> P&s;al. xxxix. 6 "Surely every man walketh in a vain &s;how," Man in this world, is but, as it were, <HI>a walking &s;tatue:</HI> his life is but <HI>an image of life;</HI> there is &s;o much of death in it.</P>
<P>If we look on our life, in the &s;everal periods of it, we will find it a heap of vanities. <HI>Childhood and youth are vanity,</HI> Eccle&s; xi. 10. We come into the world, the mo&s;t helple&s;s of all animals: young birds and bea&s;ts can do &s;omething for them&s;elves, but infant man is altogether unable to help him&s;elf. Our <HI>childhood</HI> is &s;pent in piti|ful trifling plea&s;ures, which become the &s;corn of our own after-thoughts <HI>Youth</HI> is a flower that &s;oon withereth; a blo&s;&s;om that quickly falls off; it is a &s;pace of time in which we are ra&s;h, fooli&s;h, and incon&s;iderate, plea&s;ing our&s;elves with a variety of vanities, and &s;wimming, as it were, through a flo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d of them. But ere we are aware, <HI>it</HI> is <HI>pa&s;t,</HI> and we are in <HI>middle age,</HI> encompa&s;&s;ed with a thick cloud of cares, through which we mu&s;t grope; and finding our&s;elves be&s;et with pricking thorns of difficulties; through them we mu&s;t force our way, to accompli&s;h the projects and contrivances of our riper thoughts. And the more we &s;olace our&s;elves in any earthly enjoyment we attain to, the more bitterne&s;s do we find in parting with it. Then comes <HI>old age,</HI> attended with its own train of infirmities, <HI>labour and &s;orrow,</HI> P&s;al xc 10 and &s;ets us down next door to the grave. In a word, <HI>All fle&s;h is gra&s;s,</HI> I&s;a. xl 6. Every &s;tage, or period in life, is <HI>vanity. Man at his be&s;t &s;tate</HI> (middle age, when the heat of youth is &s;pent, and the &s;orrow old age have not yet overtaken him) <HI>is altogether vanity,</HI> P&s;al. xxxix 5 Death carries off &s;ome in the <HI>bud</HI> of childhood, others in the <HI>blo&s;&s;om</HI> of youth, and others when they are come to their <HI>fruit:</HI> few are left &s;tanding, till, like <HI>ripe corn,</HI> they for&s;ake the ground: all <HI>die</HI> one time or other.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Man's life is a &s;hort thing: it is not only <HI>a vanity</HI> but <HI>a &s;hort-lived vanity.</HI> Con&s;ider, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> How the life of man is reck|oned in the &s;cripture. It was indeed &s;ometimes reckoned by <HI>hun|dreds of years:</HI> but no man ever arrived at a thou&s;and, which yet

bears no proportion to eternity. Now, <HI>hundreds</HI> are brought down to <HI>&s;cores, three&s;core and ten,</HI> or <HI>four&s;core</HI> is its utmo&s;t length, P&s;al. xc 10. But few men arrive at that length of life. Death does but rarely wait, till men be bowing down, by rea&s;on of age, to meet the grave. Yet, as if <HI>years</HI> were too big a word, for &s;uch a &s;mall thing as the life of man on earth; we find it counted by months, Job xiv 5 "The number of his months are with thee." Our cour&s;e, like that of the moon, is run in a little time; we are always waxing or waneing, till we di&s;appear. But frequently it is reckoned by days; and the&s;e but few, Job xiv 1.
<Q>Man that is born of a woman is of few days.</Q>
Nay, it is but <HI>one day</HI> in &s;cripture ac|count; and that <HI>a hireling's day,</HI> who will preci&s;ely ob&s;erve when his day ends, and give over his work, ver. 6.
<Q>Till he &s;hall ac|compli&s;h as an hireling his day.</Q>
Yea, the &s;cripture brings it down to the &s;horte&s;t &s;pace of time, and calls it <HI>a moment,</HI> 2 Cor. iv. 17. <HI>Our light afflion</HI> (though it la&s;t all our life long) <HI>is but for a moment.</HI> But el&s;ewhere it is brought down to yet a lower pitch, farther than which one cannot carry it, P&s;al xxxix. 5. <HI>Mine age is nothing before thee.</HI> Agreeable to this, <HI>Solomon</HI> tells us, Eccle&s;. iii. 2. There is <HI>a time to be born, and a time to die</HI>; but makes no mention of <HI>a time to live,</HI> as if our life were but <HI>a &s;kip from the womb to the grave. Secondly,</HI> Con&s;ider the various &s;imilitudes by which the &s;cripture repre&s;ents <HI>the &s;hortne&s;s</HI> of man's life. Hear <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> I&s;a. xxxviii. 12. "Mine age is departed, and is removed from me as a &s;hepherd's tent; I have cut off, like a weaver, my life." The &s;hepherd's tent is &s;oon <HI>removed;</HI> for the flocks mu&s;t not feed long in one place: &s;uch is a man's life on earth, quickly gone. It is a <HI>web,</HI> he is ince&s;&s;antly working; he is not idle &s;o much as one mo|ment, in a &s;hort time it is <HI>wrought,</HI> and then it is <HI>cut off.</HI> Every breathing is a thread in this <HI>web,</HI> when the la&s;t breath is drawn, the web is woven out, he expires and then it is <HI>cut off,</HI> he breathes no more. Man is like <HI>gra&s;s</HI> and like a <HI>flower,</HI> I&s;a. xl. 6
<Q>All fle&s;h (even the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t healthy fle&s;h) is gra&s;s, and all the godline&s;s thereof is as the flower of the field.</Q>
The gra&s;s is flouri&s;hing in the morning; but, in the evening, being cut down by the mowers, it is withered: &s;o man &s;ometimes is walking up and down at ea&s;e in the morning; and in the evening, is lying a corp&s;e, being knocked down by a &s;udden &s;troke, with one or other of death's weapons. <HI>The flower,</HI> at be&s;t, is but a weak and tender thing, of &s;hort continuance, where-ever it growes: but (ob&s;erve) man is not compared to the flower of <HI>the garden;</HI> but to the flower of <HI>the field,</HI> which the foot of every bea&s;t may tread down at any time. Thus is our life liable to a thou&s;and accidents, every day; any of which may cut us off. But though we &s;hould e&s;cape all the&s;e, yet at length this <HI>gra&s;s</HI> withereth, this <HI>flower</HI> fadeth of it&s;elf. It is carried off, "as the clouds is con&s;umed and vani&s;heth away." Job vii. 9 It looks big as the morning cloud, which promi&s;eth

great things, and rai&s;eth the expectations of the hu&s;bandman; but the &s;un ri&s;eth, and the cloud is &s;cattered; death comes, and man evani&s;heth. The Apo&s;tle <HI>James</HI> propo&s;eth the que&s;tion,
<Q>What is your life?</Q>
chap. iv. 14. Hear his own an&s;wer,
<Q>It is even a vapour that appeareth for a little time, and then vani&s;heth away.</Q>
It is frail, uncertain, and la&s;teth not. It is <HI>&s;moak,</HI> which goes out of the chimney, as if it would darken the face of the hea|vens; but quickly is &s;cattered, and appears no more: thus goeth man's life, and <HI>where is he?</HI> It is a <HI>wind,</HI> Job vii. 7.
<Q>O remember that my life is wind&middot;</Q>
It is but a pa&s;&s;ing bla&s;t, a &s;hort puff,
<Q>a wind that pa&s;&s;eth away and cometh not again,</Q>
P&s;al lxxviii. 39. Our breath is <HI>in our no&s;trils,</HI> as it were always upon the wind to depart; ever pa&s;&s;ing and repa&s;&s;ing like a traveller; until it go away for good and all, not to return, till the heavens be no more.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> Man's life is a <HI>&s;wift</HI> thing; not only a pa&s;&s;ing, but a <HI>flying</HI> vanity. Have you not ob&s;erved how &s;wiftly <HI>a &s;hadow</HI> hath run along the ground, in a cloudy and windy day, &s;uddenly darken|ing the places beautified before with the beams of the &s;un, but as &s;uddenly di&s;appearing? Such is the life of man on the earth, for "he fleeth as a &s;hadow, and continueth not," Job xiv 2. A wea|er's <HI>&s;huttle</HI> is very &s;wift in its motion; in a moment it is thrown from one &s;ide of the web to the other: yet
<Q>our days are &s;wifter than a weaver's &s;huttle,</Q>
chap. vii 6 How quickly is man to&s;&s;ed through time into eternity! See how <HI>Job</HI> de&s;cribes the <HI>&s;wiftne&s;s</HI> of the time of life, chap. ix 25.
<Q>Now my days are &s;wifter than a po&s;t: they flee away, they &s;ee no good.</Q>
ver 26
<Q>They are ha&s;ted away as the &s;wift &s;hips; as the eagle that ha&s;teth to the prey.</Q>
He compares his days with <HI>a po&s;t,</HI> a foot po&s;t; <HI>a run|ner,</HI> who runs &s;peedily to carry tidings, and will make no &s;tay. But, though the po&s;t were like <HI>Ah<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">naaz,</HI> who over-run <HI>Cu&s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> our days would be &s;wifter than he, for they <HI>flee away,</HI> like a m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n fleeing for his life, before the pur&s;uing enemy; he runs with his utmo&s;t vigour, yet our days run as fa&s;t as he. Howbeit, that is not all. Even he who is <HI>fleeing</HI> for his life, cannot run always; he mu&s;t needs &s;ometimes &s;tand &s;till, ly down, or run in &s;omewhere, as <HI>Si&s;era</HI> did into <HI>Jael's</HI> tent, to refre&s;h him&s;elf; but our time never halts. Therefore it is compared to <HI>&s;hips,</HI> which can &s;ail night and day without intermi&s;&s;ion, till they be at their port; and <HI>&s;wift &s;hips, &s;hips of de&s;ire,</HI> in which men quickly arrive at the de&s;ired haven; or, <HI>&s;hips of plea&s;ure,</HI> that &s;ail more &s;wiftly than &s;hips of burden. Yet the wind failing, the &s;hips cour&s;e is marred: but our time al|ways runs with a rapid cour&s;e. Therefore it is compared to <HI>the eagle</HI> flying: not with his ordinary flight, for that is not &s;ufficient to repre&s;ent the &s;wiftne&s;s of our days; but when he flies upon his <HI>prey,</HI> which is with an extraordinary &s;wiftne&s;s. And thus, even thus, our days fly away.</P>

Riches and all worldly things are but a fair <HI>nothing;</HI> they are <HI>that which is not.</HI> They are not what they <HI>&s;eem</HI> to be: they are all but gilded vanities, that deceive the eye. Comparatively <HI>they are not</HI> there is infinitely more of nothingne&s;s and not being, than of being and reality, in the be&s;t of them. What is the world, and all that is in it, but a <HI>fa&s;hion,</HI> or fair &s;how, &s;uch as men make on a &s;tage, a <HI>pa&s;&s;ing</HI> &s;how? 1 Cor. vii. 31. Royal <HI>pomp</HI> is but a gaudy &s;how, or appearance, in God's account, Acts xxv. 23. The be&s;t name they get, is <HI>good things:</HI> but, ob&s;erve it, they are only the wicked man's <HI>good things,</HI> Luke xvi. 25
<Q>Thou in thy life-time received&s;t thy good things,</Q>
&s;ays <HI>Abraham,</HI> in the parable, to the rich man in hell And well may the <HI>m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n of the world</HI> call the&s;e things their <HI>goods:</HI> for there is no other <HI>good</HI> in them, about them, nor attending them. Now <HI>wilt thou &s;et thine eyes</HI> upon empty &s;hows and fancies? Wilt thou <HI>cau&s;e thine eyes to fly on them,</HI> as the word is? Shall men's hearts fly out at their eyes upon them, as a ravenous bird on its prey? If they do, let them know, that, at length the&s;e &s;hall fly as fa&s;t away from them, as ever their eyes flew upon them: like a flock of fair feathered birds, that &s;ettle on a fool's ground; the which, when he runs to catch them as his own, do immediately take wing, fly away, and, &s;itting down on his neighbour's ground, elude his expectation, Luke xii. 20.
<Q>Thou fool, this night thy &s;oul &s;hall be required of thee: then who&s;e &s;hall the&s;e things be?</Q>
Tho' you do not <HI>make wings</HI> to them, as many do; they <HI>make them&s;elves wings,</HI> and <HI>fly away;</HI> not as a tame hou&s;e-bird, which may be catched again; nor as an hawk, that will &s;how where &s;he is by her bells, and be called again with the lure: but as <HI>an eagle,</HI> which quickly flies out of &s;ight, and cannot be recalled. Forbear thou to behold the&s;e things, O martal! there is ho rea&s;on. thou &s;hould&s;t <HI>&s;et thine eyes upon them.</HI> This world is a great inn, in the road to eternity, to which thou art travelling. Thou art <HI>attended</HI> by the&s;e things, as &s;ervants belonging to the inn, where thou lodge&s;t, they wait upon thee, while thou art there; and when thou goe&s;t away, they will convoy thee to the door. But they are not <HI>thine,</HI> they will not go away with thee; but return to wait on other &s;trangers, as they did on thee.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> It may &s;erve as a <HI>&s;pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng of Chri&s;tian re&s;olution,</HI> to cleave to Chri&s;t, adhere to his truths, and continue in his ways; whatever he may &s;uffer for &s;o doing. It would much allay the fear of man, that bringeth a &s;hare.
<Q>Who art thou, that thou &s;hould&s;t be afraid of a man that &s;hall die?</Q>I&s;a. li 12. Look on per&s;ecutors as pieces of brittle clay, that &s;hall be da&s;hed to pieces: for then &s;hall ye de&s;pi&s;e them as &s;oes, that are mortal: who&s;e terrors to others in the land of the living, &s;hall quickly die with them&s;elves. The &s;erious con&s;idera|tion of the <HI>&s;hortne&s;s</HI> of our time, and the <HI>certainty of death,</HI> will teach us, that all the advantage we can make by our apo&s;tacy, in time of trial, is not worth the while; it is not worth going out of the way to get it; and what we refu&s;e to forego for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, may quickly be
<PB N="225" REF="045042_0222_101F7F52F468C368">
taken from us by death. But, we can never lo&s;e it &s;o honourably, as for the cau&s;e of Chri&s;t and his go&s;pel: for, <HI>what glory is it</HI> that ye give up what ye have in the world, when God takes it away from you by death, whether you will or not? This con&s;ideration may teach us to undervalue life it&s;elf, and chu&s;e to forego it, rather than to &s;in. The wor&s;t that men can do, is to take away that life which we cannot long keep, tho' all the world &s;hould con&s;pire to help us to <HI>retain the Spirit.</HI> And if we refu&s;e to offer it up to God, when he calls for it in defence of his honour, he can take it from us another away; as it fared with him, who could not burn for Chri&s;t, but was afterwards burnt by an accidental fire in his hou&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> It may &s;erve for <HI>a &s;pur,</HI> to incite us to prepare for death. Con&s;ider, (1.) Your eternal &s;tate will be according to the &s;tate in which you die: death will open the doors of heaven, or hell to you. As the tree falls. &s;o it &s;hall ly thro' eternity. If the infant be dead-born, the whole world will not rai&s;e it to life again: and if one die out of Chri&s;t, in an unregenerate &s;tate, there is no more hope of him for ever. (2.) Seriou&s;ly con&s;ider, what it is to go into another world; a world of &s;pirits, wherewith we are not acquainted. How frightful is conver&s;e with &s;pirits to poor mortals in this life! and, how dreadful is the ca&s;e, when men are hurried away into another world, not knowing but devils may be their companions for ever! let us then give all diligence to make, and advance, our acquaintance with the Lord of that world. (3.) It is but a &s;hort time ye have to prepare for death, therefore, now or never; &s;eeing the time a&s;&s;igned for preparation will &s;oon be over, Eccle&s;. ix. 10.
<Q>What&s;oever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wi&s;dom in the grave, whither thou goe&s;t.</Q>
How can we be idle, having &s;o great a work to do, and &s;o little time to do it in? But if the time be &s;hort&punc; the work of preparation for death, though hard work, will not la&s;t long. The &s;hadows of the evening make the labourer work chearfully; knowing the time to be at hand, when he &s;hall be called in from his labour. (4.) Much of our &s;hort time is over already; and the younge&s;t of us all cannot a&s;&s;ure him&s;elf, that there is as much of his time to come, as is pa&s;t. Our life in the world is but a &s;hort preface to long eternity; and much of <HI>the tale</HI> is told. Oh! &s;hall we not double our diligence, when &s;o much of our time is &s;pent, and &s;o little of our great work is done? (5.) The <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> time is flying away <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd we cannot bring back time pa&s;t, it hath taken an eternal farewel <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> us: there is no kindling the fire again that is burnt to a&s;hes. The time to <HI>come</HI> is not ours: and we have no a&s;&s;urance of a &s;hare in it, when it comes. We have nothing we can call ours, but the pre&s;ent moment; and that is flying away: how &s;oon our time may be at an end we know not. Die we mu&s;t, but who can tell us, when? If death kept one &s;et time for all, we were in no hazard of a &s;urpri&s;e: but daily ob&s;ervation &s;hews us, there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> no &s;uch thing. Now the flying &s;hadow of our life allows no time for loitering.

<Q><BIBL>PROVERBS xiv. 32.</BIBL>
<P>The Wicked is driven away in his Wickedne&s;s: But the Righteous hath hope in his Death.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS text looks like the cloud betwixt the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> and <HI>Egyptians,</HI> having a dark &s;ide towards the latter, and a bright &s;ide to|wards the former. It repre&s;ents death like <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s jaylor, brining the chief butler and the chief baker out of one pri&s;on; the one to be re&s;tored to his office, and the other to be led to execution. It &s;hows the difference betwixt the godly and ungodly in their death; who, as they act a very different part in life; &s;o, in death, have a va&s;tly different exit.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> As to the death of a wicked m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n: here is, (1) The <HI>manner</HI> of his pa&s;&s;ing out of the world, He is <HI>driven away;</HI> namely, <HI>in his death,</HI> as is clear from the oppo&s;ite clau&s;e. He is forcibly thru&s;t out of his place in this world; <HI>driven away</HI> as chaff before the wind. (2) The <HI>&s;tate</HI> he pa&s;&s;eth away in.

&s;hall ly wrapt up for ever. <HI>Secondly,</HI> In a hopele&s;s &s;tate; <HI>but the righteous hath hope in his death:</HI> which plainly imports the <HI>hopele&s;ne&s;s</HI> of the <HI>wicked</HI> in their death. Whereby is not meant, that no wicked man &s;hall have any hope at all, when he is a-dying; but &s;hall die in de&s;pair. No: &s;ometimes it is &s;o indeed; but frequently it is other|wi&s;e: fooli&s;h virgins may, and often do hope to the la&s;t breath. But the wicked man has no <HI>&s;olid</HI> hope: and as for the <HI>delu&s;ive</HI> hopes he entertains him&s;elf with, death will root them up, and he &s;hall be for ever irretrievably mi&s;erable.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> As to the death of a <HI>righteous</HI> man; he <HI>hath hope</HI> in his death. This is u&s;hered in with a <HI>but,</HI> importing a removal of the&s;e dreadful circum&s;tances, with which the wicked man is attended, who is driven away in his wickedne&s;s: but the godly <HI>are not &s;o.</HI> Not &s;o, (1.) In the <HI>manner</HI> of their pa&s;&s;ing out of the world. The righteous is not <HI>driven away</HI> as chaff before the wind; but led away as a bride to the marriage-chamber, carried <HI>away</HI> by the angels into <HI>Abraham</HI>'s bo&s;om, Luke xvi. 22. (2.) Not &s;o as to their <HI>&s;tate,</HI> when pa&s;&s;ing out of this life. The righteous man dies, (1.) Not in a <HI>&s;inful,</HI> but in a holy &s;tate. He goes not away <HI>in</HI> his &s;in, but <HI>out</HI> of it. In his life he was <HI>putting off the old man,</HI> changing his pri&s;on-garments: and now the remaining rags of them are removed, and he is adorned with robes of glory. (2.) Not in a <HI>hopele&s;s,</HI> but a <HI>hopeful</HI> &s;tate. He <HI>hath hope in his death:</HI> he has the grace of hope, and the well-&s;ounded expectation of better things, than ever he had in this world: and tho' the &s;tream of his hope at death may run &s;hallow; yet he has &s;till as much of it, as makes him <HI>venture</HI> his eternal intere&s;ts upon the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>

<PB N="228" REF="045042_0225_101F7F59D18BA748">
and the wicked</HI>; and ye will &s;ee the &s;ame thing in that other text, Mal. iii. 18.
<Q>Then &s;hall ye return, and di&s;cern between the righ|teous and the wicked</Q>
Wherefore, if ye be not <HI>righteous,</HI> ye are <HI>wicked.</HI> If ye have not an <HI>imputed</HI> righteou&s;ne&s;s, and an <HI>im|planted</HI> righteou&s;ne&s;s, or <HI>holine&s;s;</HI> if ye be yet in your <HI>natural &s;tate</HI> unregenerated, not united to Chri&s;t by faith: how&s;oever <HI>moral,</HI> and <HI>blamele&s;s</HI> in the eyes of men, your conver&s;ation may be; ye are the wicked, who &s;hall be driven away in their <HI>wickedne&s;s,</HI> if death find you in that &s;tate. Now,</P>
<P>FIRST, As to the meaning of this phra&s;e <HI>driven away;</HI> there are three things in it: the wicked &s;hall be taken away <HI>&s;uddenly, violently,</HI> and <HI>irre&s;i&s;tibly.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Unrenewed men &s;hall be taken away <HI>&s;uddenly</HI> at death. Not that all wicked men die &s;uddenly; nor that they are all wicked who die &s;o, God forbid! But, (1.) Death commonly comes upon them unexpected, and &s;o &s;urpri&s;eth them; as the deluge came &s;ur|pri&s;ingly on the old world, tho' they were forewarned of it long before it came: as <HI>travail cometh on a woman with child,</HI> with &s;ur|pri&s;ing &s;uddenne&s;s; although looked for and expected, 1 The&s;&s;. v. 3. Death <HI>&s;eizeth</HI> them, as a creditor doth his debtor, to hale him to pri&s;on, P&s;al. lv. 15. And that when they are not aware. Death comes in, as a thief&punc; at the window, and finds them full of bu&s;y <HI>thoughts</HI> about this life, which <HI>that very day peri&s;h.</HI> (2.) Death al|ways &s;eizeth them <HI>unprepared</HI> for it: the old hou&s;e falls down about their ears, before they have another provided. When death ca&s;ts them to the door, they have not where to lay their heads; unle&s;s it be on a bed of fire and brime&s;tone. The &s;oul and body are as it were hugging one another in mutual embraces: when death comes like a whirlwind, and &s;epartes them. (3.) Death hurries them away in a moment to de&s;truction, and makes a mo&s;t di&s;mal change: the man, for the mo&s;t part, never knows where he is, till <HI>in hell he lift up his eyes,</HI> Luke xvi. 23. The floods of wrath &s;uddenly overwhelm his &s;oul; and ere he is aware, he is plunged in the bottomle&s;s pit.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The unrenewed man is taken away out of the world <HI>violently</HI> Driving is a violent action: he is <HI>cho&s;ed out of the world,</HI> Job xviii 18. Fain would he &s;tay if he could: but death drags him away like a malefactor to the execution He <HI>&s;ought</HI> no other por|tion, than the profits and plea&s;ures of this world; he <HI>hath</HI> no other; he really <HI>de&s;ires</HI> no other: how can he then go away out of it, if he were not driven?</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;t.</HI> "But may not a wicked man be willing to die? <HI>An&s;.</HI> He may indeed be willing to die; but (ob&s;erve) it is only in one of three ca&s;es. (1.) In a fit of <HI>pa&s;&s;ion,</HI> by rea&s;on of &s;ome trouble that he is impatient to be rid of. Thus many per&s;ons, when their pa&s;|&s;ion has got the better of their rea&s;on, and when, on that account, they are mo&s;t unfit to die, will be ready to cry, <HI>O to be gone!</HI> but &s;hould their de&s;ire be granted, and death come at their call, they
<PB N="229" REF="045042_0226_101F7F5FF6F9BEE8">
would quickly &s;hew they were not in earne&s;t; and that if they go, they mu&s;t be <HI>driven</HI> away again&s;t their wills. (2) When they are brim-full of <HI>de&s;pair,</HI> they may be willing to die. Thus <HI>Saul</HI> mur|dered him&s;elf: and <HI>Spira</HI> wi&s;hed to be in hell, that he might know the uttermo&s;t of what he believed he was to &s;uffer. In this manner men may &s;eek after death, while it flies from them. But fearful is the <HI>violence</HI> the&s;e do undergo, whom the terrors of God do thus <HI>drive.</HI> (3.) When they are dreaming of <HI>happine&s;s</HI> after death. Fooli&s;h virgins, under the power of <HI>delu&s;ion,</HI> as to their <HI>&s;tate,</HI> may be willing to die, having no fear of lying down in &s;orrow. How many are there, who can give no &s;cripture ground for their <HI>hope,</HI> who yet have no bands in their death! Many are driven to dark|ne&s;s &s;leeping; they go off like lambs, who would rore like lions, did they but know what place they are going to: though the cha|riot, in which they are, drive furiou&s;ly to the depths of hell; yet they fear not, becau&s;e they are fa&s;t a&s;leep.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> The unregenerate man is taken away <HI>irre&s;i&s;tibly.</HI> He mu&s;t go, though &s;ore again&s;t his <HI>will.</HI> Death will take no refu&s;al, nor admit of any delay; tho' the man has not lived half his days, according to his own computation. If he will not <HI>bow,</HI> it will <HI>break</HI> him. If he will not come forth, it will pull the hou&s;e down about his ears; for there he mu&s;t not &s;tay Although the phy&s;ician help, friends groan, the wife and children cry, and the man him&s;elf u&s;e his utmo&s;t efforts to retain the Spirit, his &s;oul is required of him; yield he mu&s;t, and go where he &s;hall never more &s;ee light.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, Let us con&s;ider, <HI>whence</HI> they are driven, and <HI>whither.</HI> When the wicked die, (1.) They are driven out of <HI>this</HI> world, where they &s;inned; into the <HI>other</HI> world, where they mu&s;t be judged, and receive their particular &s;entences, Heb ix.
<Q>It is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment.</Q>
They &s;hall no more return to their beloved earth. Tho' their hearts are wedded to their earthly enjoyments, they mu&s;t leave them; they can carry nothing hence. How &s;orrowful mu&s;t their departure be, when they have nothing in view, &s;o good as that which they leave behind them! (2) They are driven out of the &s;ociety of the <HI>&s;aints</HI> on earth, into the &s;ociety of the <HI>damned</HI> in hell, Luke xvi 22. "The rich man al&s;o died and was buried." ver. 23. "And in hell he lift up his eyes." What a multitude of the devil's <HI>goats</HI> do now take place among Chri&s;t's <HI>&s;heep!</HI> but at death they &s;hall be <HI>led forth with the workers of iniquity,</HI> P&s;al. cxxv.5. There is a mixed multitude in this world, but no mixture in the other; each party is there &s;et by them&s;elves. Though hypocrites grow here as <HI>tares</HI> among the <HI>wheat,</HI> death will root them up&punc; and they &s;hall be bound in bundles for the fire.&mdash; (3.) They are driven out of <HI>time</HI> into <HI>eternity.</HI> While time la&s;ts with them, there is hope; but when time goes, all hope goes with it. Precious time is now lavi&s;hly &s;pent: it lies &s;o heavy upon the
<PB N="230" REF="045042_0227_101F7F61CCF07060">
hands of many, that they think them&s;elves obliged to take &s;everal ways to <HI>drive away time.</HI> But beware of being at a lo&s;s what to do in life: improve time for eternity, whil&s;t you have it: for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re long death will drive it from you, and you from it, &s;o as ye &s;hall never meet again. (4.) They are driven out of their &s;pecious pre|tences to piety. Death &s;trips them of the &s;plended robes of a fair profe&s;&s;ion, with which &s;ome of them were adorned; and turns them off the &s;tage, in the rags of a wicked heart and life. The word <HI>hypocrite</HI> properly &s;ignifies a &s;tage player, who appears to be what indeed he is not. This world is the &s;tage on which the&s;e children of the devil per&s;onate the children of God. Their &s;hew of religion is the player's coat, <HI>under</HI> which one mu&s;t look, who will <HI>judge</HI> of them aright. Now death turns them out of their coat, and then they appear in their native dre&s;s: it unveils them, and takes off their ma&s;k. There are none in the other world, who pretend to be better than they really are. Depraved nature acts in the regions of horror, unallayed, and undi&s;gui&s;ed. <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> They are driven away from all <HI>means of grace:</HI> and are &s;et beyond the line, quite out of all pro&s;pect of mercy. There is no more an opportunity to buy oil for the lamp; it is <HI>gone out</HI> at death, and can never be lighted again. There may be offers of mercy and peace made after they are gone; but they are to <HI>others,</HI> not to <HI>them;</HI> there are no &s;uch offers in the place, to which they are driven; the&s;e offers are only made in that place, <HI>from</HI> which they are driven away.</P>
<P>LASTLY, In what re&s;pect may they be &s;aid to be driven away <HI>in their wickedne&s;s? An&s;.</HI> (1.) In re&s;pect of their being driven away in their <HI>&s;inful unconverted &s;tate.</HI> Having <HI>lived</HI> enemies to God, they <HI>die</HI> in a &s;tate of enmity to him: for none are brought into the eternal &s;tate of con&s;ummate happine&s;s, but by the way of the &s;tate of grace, or begun recovery in this life. The child that is dead in the womb, is born dead, and is ca&s;t out of the womb into the grave: &s;o he who is <HI>dead, while he liveth,</HI> or is &s;piritually dead, is ca&s;t forth of the womb of time, in the &s;ame &s;tate of death, into the pit of utter mi&s;ery. O mi&s;erable death, to die in the gall of bitterne&s;s and bond of iniquity! it had been incomparably better for &s;uch as die thus, that they had never been born. (2.) In regard they die <HI>&s;inning,</HI> acting wickedly again&s;t God. in contradiction to the divine law: for they can do nothing but <HI>&s;in</HI> while they live. So death takes them in the very <HI>act</HI> of &s;inning; violently draws them from the embraces of their lu&s;ts, and drives them away to the tri|bunal to receive their &s;entence. It is a remarkable expre&s;&s;ion, Job xxxvi. 14. <HI>They <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in youth:</HI> the marginal reading <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, <HI>their &s;oul dieth in youth;</HI> their lu&s;ts being lively their de&s;ires vigorous, and expec|tations big, as is common in youth. <HI>And their life is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> un|clean:</HI> or, <HI>and the company</HI> (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r herd) <HI>of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> dieth <HI>among the</HI> Sodo|mites, <HI>i. e.</HI> is taken away in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of their &s;in and wickedne&s;s&punc; as the <HI>Sodomites</HI> were, Gen. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">x.

But all hope being cut off, and the&s;e gifts withdrawn, the wickedne&s;s of the wicked will then arrive at its perfection. As the &s;eeds of grace &s;own in the hearts of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, come to their full maturity at death: &s;o wicked and helli&s;h di&s;po&s;itions in the repro|bate come then to their highe&s;t pitch.

<P>If, I &s;hall di&s;cover the <HI>hopele&s;ne&s;s</HI> of the &s;tate of unrenewed men, at death. It appears to be very hopele&s;s, if we con&s;ider the&s;e four things:</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Death cuts off all their hopes and pro&s;pects of peace and plea&s;ure in this life, Luke xii. 19.
<Q>Soul, thou ha&s;t much goods laid up for many years, take thine ea&s;e, eat, drink and be merry. Ver. 20. But God &s;aid unto him. Thou fool, this night thy &s;oul &s;hall be required of thee; then who&s;e &s;hall tho&s;e things be, which thou ha&s;t provided?</Q>
They look for great matters in this world, they hope to increa&s;e their wealth, to &s;ee their families pro&s;per, and to live at ea&s;e; but death comes like a &s;tormy wind, and &s;hakes off all their fond hopes, like green fruit from off a tree.
<Q>When he is about to fill his belly, God &s;hall ca&s;t the fury of his wrath upon him?</Q>
Job xx. 23. He may begin a web of contrivances, for advancing his worldly intere&s;t: but before he gets it wrought out, death comes and cuts it out.
<Q>His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth: in that very day his thoughts peri&s;h,</Q>
P&s;al. cxlvi. 4.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> When death comes, they have no &s;olid grounds to hope for eternal happine&s;s.
<Q>For what is the hope of the hypocrite, tho' he hath gamed, when God taketh away his &s;oul?</Q>
Job xxvii. 8. Whatever hopes they fondly entertain, they are not founded on God's <HI>word,</HI> which is the only &s;ure ground of hope: if they knew their own ca&s;e, they would &s;ee them&s;elves only happy in a dream. And indeed
<PB N="232" REF="045042_0229_101F7F6BB1399000">
what hope can they have? The law is plain again&s;t them, and con|demns them. The cur&s;es of it (the&s;e cords of death) are about them already. The Saviour, whom they &s;lighted, is <HI>now</HI> their Judge; and their Judge is their enemy. How then can they hope? They have bolted the door of mercy again&s;t them&s;elves by their unbelief. They have de&s;pi&s;ed the remedy, and therefore mu&s;t die without mercy. They have no &s;aving intere&s;t in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the only channel of conveyance, in which mercy flows; and therefore they can never ta&s;te of it. The &s;word of ju&s;tice guards the door of mercy, &s;o as none can enter in, but the members of the my&s;tical body of Chri&s;t over who&s;e heads is a covert of atoning blood the Mediator's blood. The&s;e indeed may pa&s;s without harm, for ju&s;tice has nothing to require of them. But others cannot pa&s;s, &s;ince they are not <HI>in Chri&s;t:</HI> death comes to them with the <HI>&s;ting</HI> in it&punc; the &s;ting of unpardoned guilt. It is armed again&s;t them with all the force the &s;anction of a holy law can give it, 1 Cor. xv. 56.
<Q>The &s;ting of death is &s;in, and the &s;trength of &s;in is the law.</Q>
When that law was given on <HI>Sinai,</HI>
<Q>the whole mount quaked greatly,</Q>
Exod. xix. 18. When the Redeemer was making &s;atisfaction for the elect's breaking of it,
<Q>the earth did quake, and the rocks rent,</Q>
Matth. xxvii. 51. What po&s;&s;ible ground of hope then is there to the wicked man, when death comes upon him armed with the force of this law? How can he e&s;cape that fire, which "burnt unto the mid&s;t of heaven?" Deut. iv 11. How &s;hall he be able to &s;tand in that &s;moke, that "a&s;cended as the &s;moak of a furnace?' Exod. xix. 18. How will be endure the terrible
<Q>thunders and lightnings,</Q>
ver. 16. and dwell in
<Q>the darkne&s;s, clouds and thick darkne&s;s?</Q>
Deut. iv. 11. All the&s;e re&s;emblances heaped together, do but faintly repre&s;ent the fearful tempe&s;t of wrath and indignation, which &s;hall pur&s;ue the wicked to the lowe&s;t hell: and for ever abide on them, who are <HI>driven to darkne&s;s</HI> at death.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Death roots up their <HI>delu&s;ive hopes</HI> of eternal happine&s;s: then it is their covenant with death, and agreement with hell is broken. They are awakned out of their golden dreams, and at length lift up their eyes: Job viii. 14.
<Q>Who&s;e hope &s;hall be cut off, and who&s;e tru&s;t &s;hall be a &s;pider's web.</Q>
They tru&s;t all &s;hall be well with them after death: but this their <HI>tru&s;t</HI> is but a <HI>web</HI> woven out of their own bowels, with a great deal of art and indu&s;try. They wrap them&s;elves up in this their hope, as the &s;pider wraps her&s;elf in her web. But it is but a weak and &s;lender defence; for however it may with&s;tand the threatnings of the word of God; death, that <HI>be&s;om of de&s;truction,</HI> will &s;weep <HI>them</HI> and <HI>it</HI> both away, &s;o as there &s;hall not be the lea&s;t &s;hred of it left them; but he, who this moment will not let his hope go, &s;hall next moment be utterly hopele&s;s Death overturns the hou&s;e built on the &s;and: it leaves no man under the power of delu&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> Death makes their &s;tate <HI>ab&s;olutely,</HI> and for <HI>ever</HI> hopele&s;s. Matters cannot be retrieved and amended after death. For (1.) Time once gone can never be recalled. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f cries or tears&punc; price or pains,

could bring time back again; the wicked man might <HI>have hope in his death.</HI> But tears of blood will not prevail; nor will his roaring for millions of ages, cau&s;e it to return. The &s;un will not &s;tand &s;till until the &s;luggard awake, and enter on his journey; and when once it is gone down, he needs not expect the night to be turned into day <HI>for his &s;ake;</HI> he mu&s;t lodge thro' the long night of eternity, where his time left him. (2.) There is no returning to this life, to amend what is ami&s;s: it is a &s;tate of probation and trial, which terminates at death; and therefore we cannot return to it again: it is but once we thus live, and once we die. Death carries the wicked man to <HI>his own place,</HI> Acts i. 25. This life is our working day: death clo&s;eth our day and our work together. We may readily imagine the wicked might have &s;ome hope in their death; if, after death has opened their eyes, they could return to life, and have but the trial of one Sabbath, one offer of Chri&s;t, one day, or but one hour more, to make up their peace with God: but,
<Q>man lieth down, and ri&s;eth not till the heavens be no more; they &s;hall not awake, nor be rai&s;ed out of their &s;leep,</Q>
Job xiv. 12. <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> In the other world, men have no acce&s;s to get their ruined &s;tate and condition retrieved, if they never &s;o fain would.
<Q>For there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wi&s;dom in the grave, whither thou goe&s;t,</Q>
Eccle&s;. ix. 10. Now, a man may flee from the wrath to come; now he may get into a refuge: but when once death has done its work, the <HI>door is &s;hut:</HI> there are no more offers of mercy, no more pardons: where the tree is fallen, there it mu&s;t ly.</P>
<P>Let what has been &s;aid, be carefully pondered, and that it may be of u&s;e, let me exhort you,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> To take heed that ye entertain no hopes of heaven, but what are built on a &s;olid foundation: tremble to think what fair <HI>hopes</HI> of happine&s;s death &s;weeps away like cobweb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">: how the hopes of many are cut off, when they &s;eem to them&s;elves to be on the very thre&s;hold of heaven; how, in the moment they expected to be carried by angels into <HI>Abraham</HI>'s bo&s;om, into the regions of bli&s;s and peace, they are carried by devils into the &s;ociety of the damned in hell, into the place of torment, and regions of horror. I be&s;eech you to beware, (1.) Of a hope built up, where the ground was never cleared. The wi&s;e builder <HI>digged deep,</HI> Luke vi. 48. Were your hopes of heaven never &s;haken; but ye have had good hopes all your days? Alas for it; you may &s;ee the my&s;tery of your ca&s;e explained, Luke xi. 21.
<Q>When a &s;trong man armed keepeth his place, his goods are in peace.</Q>
But if they have been &s;haken; take heed le&s;t there have only &s;ome breaches been made in the old building which you have got repaired again, by ways and means of your own I a&s;&s;ure you your hope (how&s;oever fair a building it is) is not to tru&s;t to; unle&s;s your old hopes have been razed, and you have built on a foundation quite new (2) Beware of that hope which looks bri&s;k in the dark; but lo&s;eth all its lu&s;tre, when it is &s;et in the light of God's word, when it is

examined and tried by the touch&s;tone of divine revelation, John iii 20.
<Q>For every one that doth evil, hatcth the light, neither cometh to the light, le&s;t his deeds &s;hould be reproved. Ver. 21. But he that doth the truth, cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made mani|fe&s;t, that they are wrought in God.</Q>
That hope, which cannot abide &s;cripture-trial, but &s;inks when &s;earched into by &s;acred truth, is a delu|&s;ion, and not a true hope: for God's word is always a friend to the graces of God's Spirit, and an enemy to delu&s;ion. (3.) Beware of that hope, which &s;tands without being &s;upported by &s;cripture-evidences. Alas! many are big with hopes, who cannot give, becau&s;e they really have not any &s;cripture-grounds for them. Thou hope&s;t that all &s;hall be well with thee after death: but what word of God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s it, on which thou ha&s;t <HI>own cau&s;ed to hope?</HI> P&s;al. cxix. 49.

Numbers of men are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> with &s;uch hopes as &s;tand un&s;upported by &s;cripture-evidence. Men are fond and tenacious of the&s;e hopes; but death will throw them down and leave the &s;elf-deceiver hopele&s;s. <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> Beware of that hope of heaven, which doth not prepare and di&s;po&s;e you for heaven, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er makes your &s;oul more holy, 1 John iii. 3.
<Q>Every man that hath this hope in him, purifieth him&s;elf, even as he is pure</Q>
The hope of the mo&s;t part of men is, rather a hope to be free of <HI>pain</HI> and <HI>torment</HI> in another life; than a hope of <HI>true happine&s;s,</HI> the nature whereof is not under&s;tood and di&s;cerned: and therefore it &s;takes down in &s;loth and indolence, and does not excite to mortification and a hea|venly life.. So far are they from hoping <HI>aright</HI> for heaven; that they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> own, if they &s;peak their genuine &s;entiments, removing out of this world into <HI>any</HI> other place what&s;oever, is rather their <HI>fear</HI> than their <HI>hope.</HI> The glory of the heavenly city does not at all draw their hearts <HI>upwards</HI> towards it; nor do they lift up their heads with joy, in the pro&s;pect of arriving at it. If they had the true hope of the marriage-day, they would, as the birde, <HI>the Lamb's wife,</HI> be <HI>making them&s;elves ready for it,</HI> Rev xix. 7. But their hopes are produced by their &s;loth, and their &s;loth is nouri&s;hed by their hopes Oh! Sirs, as ye would not be driven away hopele&s;s in your death, beware of the&s;e hopes. Raze them now, and build on a new foundation; le&s;t death leave not one &s;tone of them upon another, and ye never be able to hope any more.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Ha&s;ten, O &s;inners, out of your wickedne&s;s, out of your &s;inful &s;tate, and out of your wicked life: if ye would not at death be driven away in your wickedne&s;s. Remember the fatal end of the wicked man, as the text repre&s;ents it. I know there is a great dif|ference in the death of the wicked, in re&s;pect of &s;ome circum&s;tances: but all of them, in their death, agree in this, that they are <HI>driven away in their wickedne&s;s.</HI> Some of them die <HI>re&s;olutely,</HI> as if they

&s;corned to be <HI>afraid.</HI> Some in <HI>raging de&s;pair,</HI> &s;o filled with horror, that they cry out, as if they were already in hell: others in <HI>&s;ullen de&s;pondency,</HI> oppre&s;t with fears, in&s;omuch, that their hearts are &s;unk within him, upon the remembrance of mi&s;-&s;pent time, and the view they have of eternity; having neither head nor heart to do any thing for their own relief.

<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> O be concerned for others, e&s;pecially for your relations, that they may not continue in their &s;inful natural &s;tate, but be brought into a &s;tate of &s;alvation; le&s;t they be driven away in their wickedne&s;s at death What would ye not do to prevent any of your friends dying an untimely and violent death? But alas! do not ye &s;ee them in hazard of being driven away in their wickedne&s;s? Is not death approaching them, even the younge&s;t of them?

<HEAD><HI>DOCTRINE II.</HI> The State of the Godly in Death, is a hopeful State.</HEAD>
<P>We have &s;een the dark &s;ide of the cloud looking towards ungodly men, pa&s;&s;ing out of the world: let us now take a view of the bright &s;ide of it, &s;hining on the godly, as they are entring upon their eternal &s;tate. In di&s;cour&s;ing this &s;ubject, I &s;hall confirm this doctrine, an&s;wer an objection again&s;t it, and then make &s;ome practical improvement of the whole.</P>
<P>For <HI>confirmation,</HI> let it be ob&s;erved, That although the pa&s;&s;age out of this world by death, have a frightful a&s;pect to poor mortals; and to mi&s;carry in it mu&s;t needs be of fatal con&s;equence; yet the following circum&s;tances make the &s;tate of the godly in their death, <HI>happy</HI> and <HI>hopeful.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> They have a tru&s;ty good <HI>friend</HI> before them in the other world; Je&s;us Chri&s;t their be&s;t friend, is Lord of that land to which death carries them. When <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> &s;ent for his father to come down to him to <HI>Egypt,</HI> telling him, <HI>God had made him Lord over all Egypt,</HI> Gen. xlv. 9. and <HI>when Jacob &s;aw the waggons Jo&s;eph had &s;ent to carry him, the &s;pirit of Jacob revived,</HI> ver. 27. He frankly re&s;olves to un|dertake the journey. I think, when the Lord calls a godly man, out of this world, he &s;ends him &s;uch glad tidings, and &s;uch a kind invitation into the other world; that if he had faith to believe it, his &s;pirit mu&s;t <HI>revive,</HI> when he &s;ees the waggon of death, which comes to carry him thither. It is true indeed, he has a weighty trial to undergo; <HI>after death the judgment.</HI> But the ca&s;e of the godly is altogether hopeful; for the <HI>Lord of the land</HI> is their <HI>hu&s;band,</HI> and their <HI>hu&s;band</HI> is their <HI>Judge: The Father hath committed all judgment unto the Son,</HI> John v. 22. And &s;urely the ca&s;e of the wife is hopeful, when her own hu&s;band is her judge; even &s;uch a hu&s;band as hates putting away. No hu&s;band is &s;o loving and &s;o tender of his &s;pou&s;e, as the Lord Chri&s;t is of his. One would think, it would be a very bad land, which a wife would not willingly go to, where her <HI>hu&s;band</HI> is the <HI>ruler</HI> and <HI>judge.</HI> Moreover, their <HI>Judge</HI> is the <HI>Advocate,</HI> 1 John ii. 1.
<Q>We have an Advocate with the Father, Je&s;us Chri&s;t the righteous.</Q>
And therefore they need not fear their being put back, and falling into condemnation. What can be more favourable? Can they think, that he who pleads their cau&s;e, will him&s;elf pa&s;s &s;entence again&s;t them: Yet further, their <HI>Advocate</HI> is the <HI>Redeemer;</HI> they are <Q>redeemed with the prcious blood of Chri&s;t,</Q>
1 Pet. i. 18, 19. So when he pleads for them, he is pleading his own cau&s;e. Though an advocate may be carele&s;s of the intere&s;t of one who employs him; &s;urely he will do his utmo&s;t to defend his own right, which he hath purcha&s;ed with his money: and &s;hall not their Advocate defend the purcha&s;e of his own <HI>blood?</HI> But more than all that, their Redeemer is their <HI>head,</HI>

<P>Death can do them no harm. It cannot even hurt their bodies: for tho' it &s;eparate the &s;oul from the body, it cannot &s;eparate the body from the Lord Chri&s;t.

The &s;oul and life of it is gone: it is but a walking <HI>&s;hade</HI> that may <HI>fright,</HI> but cannot <HI>hurt</HI> &s;aints; it is only <HI>the &s;hadow of death to them;</HI> it is not the thing it&s;elf: their dying is but <HI>as dying,</HI> or &s;omewhat like dying.

Certainly the nature of death is quite changed with re&s;pect to the &s;aints. It is not to them, what it was to Je&s;us Chri&s;t their head: It is not the invenomed ruinating thing, wrapt up in the &s;anction of the fir&s;t covenant, Gen ii. 19. <HI>In the day thou eate&s;t thereof thou &s;halt &s;urely die.</HI> It comes to the godly without its &s;ting: they may meet it with that &s;alutation, <HI>O death, where is thy &s;ting?</HI> is this <HI>Mara?</HI> Is this bitter death? It <HI>went out full</HI> into the world, when the fir&s;t <HI>Adam</HI> opened the door to it: but the &s;econd <HI>Adam hath brought</HI> it <HI>again empty</HI> to his own people.

If death arre&s;t the &s;aint, and carry him before the Judge, to an&s;wer for the debt he contracted, the debt will be &s;ound paid by the glorious Cautio|ner: and he has the di&s;charge to &s;how. The thorn of guilt is pulled out of the man's con&s;cience; and his name is blotted out of the black roll, and written among the <HI>living in Jeru&s;alem.</HI> It is true, it is a great journey to go through the valley of the &s;hadow of death: but the &s;aint's burden is <HI>taken away</HI> from off his back, his iniquity is pardoned, he may walk at ca&s;e; <HI>no lion &s;hall be there, nor any ravenous bea&s;t:</HI> the redeemed may walk at lei&s;ure there, free from all apprehen&s;ions of danger.</P>

Some were wont to <HI>mourn</HI> at births, and <HI>rejoice</HI> at burials. But the practice of &s;ome <HI>Indian nations</HI> is yet more &s;trange. of whom it is reported, that upon the hu&s;band's decea&s;e, his &s;everal wives were it u&s;e to con|tend, before the judges, which of them was the be&s;t beloved wife: and &s;he, in who&s;e favours it was determined, with a chearful coun|tenance, threw her&s;elf into the flames prepared for her hu&s;band's corp&s;e, was burned with it, and reckoned happy, while the re&s;t lived in grief, and were accounted mi&s;erable. But, how&s;oever lame notions of a future &s;tate, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by pride, affectation of applau&s;e, apprehen&s;ions of difficulties in this life, and &s;uch like principles, proper to depraved human nature, may influence rude, unculti|vated minds, when &s;trengthned by the arts of hell: O! what &s;olid joy and con&s;olation may they have who are <HI>true</HI> Chri&s;tians, being <HI>in Chri&s;t,</HI> who <HI>hath brought life and immortality to light by the go&s;pel!</HI> 2 Tim. i. 10. Death is one of the&s;e <HI>all things,</HI> that <HI>work together for good, to them that love God,</HI> Rom. viii. 28. When the body dies, the &s;oul is perfected: the body of death goes off at the death of the body. What harm did the jaylor to <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s butler, when he opened the pri&s;on door to him, and let him out? Is the bird in wor&s;e ca&s;e, when at liberty, than when confined in a cage? Thus, and no wor&s;e, are the <HI>&s;ouls</HI> of the &s;aints treated by death.

ANSW. It mu&s;t be own|ed, that &s;aints do not all die in one and the &s;ame manner; there is a diver&s;ity among them, as well as among the wicked; yet the wor&s;t ca&s;e of a dying &s;aint is indeed a hopeful one. Some die <HI>trium|phantly,</HI> in a full a&s;&s;urance of faith. 2 Tim. iv. 6.
<Q>The time of my departure is at hand. ver. 7. I have fought a good fight, I have fini&s;hed my cour&s;e, I have kept the faith. ver. 8. Hence|forth there is laid up for me a crown of righteou&s;ne&s;s.</Q>
They get a ta&s;te of the joys of heaven, while here on earth; and begin the &s;ongs of <HI>Zion,</HI> while yet in a &s;trange land. Others die in a &s;olid <HI>fiducial dependence</HI> on their Lord and Saviour: though they cannot <HI>&s;ing</HI> triumphantly, yet they can and will <HI>&s;ay</HI> confidently, <HI>The Lord is their God.</HI> Though they cannot triumph over death, with old <HI>Simeon,</HI> having Chri&s;t in his arms, and &s;aying,
<Q>Lord, now lette&s;t thou thy &s;ervant depart in peace, according to thy word. For mine eyes have &s;een thy &s;alvation,</Q>
Luke ii. 29, 30. yet they can &s;ay with dying <HI>Jacob,</HI> 'I have waited for thy &s;alvation, O Lord.' Gen. xlix. 18. His left hand is under their head to &s;upport them; though his right hand doth not embrace them: they firmly <HI>believe,</HI> though they are not filled with <HI>joy</HI> in believing. They can plead the <HI>covenant,</HI> and hang by the promi&s;e, <HI>although their hou&s;e is not &s;o with God,</HI> as they could wi&s;h. But the dying-day of &s;ome &s;aints may be like that day mentioned. Zech. xiv. 7. <HI>Not day, nor night.</HI> They may die under great doubts and fears; &s;etting as it were, in a cloud, and going to heaven in a mi&s;t. They may go mourning with|out the &s;un, and never put off their <HI>&s;pirit of heavine&s;s,</HI> till death &s;trip them of it. They may be carried to heaven through the con|fines of hell; and may be pur&s;ued by the devouring lion, even to the very gates of the new <HI>Jeru&s;alem;</HI> and may be compared to a &s;hip almo&s;t wrecked in &s;ight of the harbour, which yet gets &s;afe into her port, 1 Cor. iii. 15.
<Q>If any man's works &s;hall be burnt, he &s;hall &s;uffer lo&s;s: but he him&s;elf &s;hall be &s;aved, yet &s;o as by fire.</Q>
There is &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ty amid&s;t their fears, but danger in the wicked's &s;tronge&s;t confidence; and there is a ble&s;&s;ed &s;eed of gladne&s;s in their greate&s;t &s;orrows,

P&s;al. xcvii. 11.</P>
<P>Now, &s;aints are liable to &s;uch perplexity in their death, becau&s;e, though they be Chri&s;tians indeed, yet they are <HI>men of alike pa&s;&s;ions</HI> with others; and death is a frightful object in it&s;elf, whatever dre&s;s it appear in: the &s;tern countenance, with which it looks at mortals, can hardly mi&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of cau&s;ing them &s;hrink. Moreover, the &s;aints are of all men the mo&s;t <HI>jealous</HI> of them&s;elves. They think of eternity, and of a tribunal, more deeply than others do: with them, it is a more &s;erious thing to die than the re&s;t of mankind are aware of. They know the <HI>deceits</HI> of the heart, the &s;ubtilities of depraved human nature, better than others do. And therefore they may have much ado<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> keep up hope on a death-bed: while others pa&s;s off quietly, like <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">

By his being in the &s;tate of grace <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> indeed always <HI>habitually prepared</HI> for death, and his <HI>dying <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"></HI> is in&s;ured; but there is more requi&s;ite to his <HI>actual preparation,</HI> and dying <HI>comfortably;</HI> his &s;pirit mu&s;t be in good <HI>condition</HI> too.</P>
<P>Wherefore, there are three ca&s;es, in which death cannot but be very uncomfortable to a <HI>child of God.</HI> (1.) If it &s;eize him at a time when the <HI>guilt</HI> of &s;ome particular &s;in unrepented of, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> lying on his <HI>con&s;cience;</HI> and death comes on that very account, to take him out of the land of the living; as was the cau&s;e of many of the <HI>Corinthian</HI> believers, 1 Cor. xi. 30.
<Q>For this cau&s;e (namely, of unworthy communicating) many are weak and &s;ickly among you, and many &s;leep.</Q>
If a per&s;on is &s;urpri&s;ed with the approach of death, while lying under the guilt of &s;ome unpardoned &s;in, it cannot but cau&s;e a mighty con&s;ternation. (2) When death catches him <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pping.</HI> The mighty cry mu&s;t be frightful to &s;leeping virgins. The man who lies in a ruinous hou&s;e, and awakens not till the timber begins to crack, and the &s;tones to drop down about his ears, may indeed get out of it &s;afely, but not without fears of being cru&s;hed by its fall. When a Chri&s;tian has been going on in a cour&s;e of &s;ecurity and back&s;liding, and awakens not till death comes to his bed-&s;ide; it is no marvel if he get a fearful awakening. <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> When he has lo&s;t &s;ight of his &s;aving intere&s;t in Chri&s;t, and cannot produce evidences of his title to heaven. It is hard to meet death without &s;ome evidence of a tittle to eternal life at hand: hard to go through the dark valley without the candle of the Lord &s;hining upon the head. It is a terrible adventure to lau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h out into eternity, when a man can make no better of it, than a leap in the dark, not knowing where he &s;hall light, whether in heaven or hell.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, the &s;tate of the &s;aints, in their death, is always in it|&s;elf hopeful. The pre&s;umptuous hopes of the ungodly, in their death, cannot make their &s;tate <HI>hopeful;</HI> neither can the hopele&s;ne&s;s of a &s;aint make his &s;tate <HI>hopele&s;s:</HI> for God judgeth according to the truth of the thing, not according to men's opinions about it. Howbeit the &s;aints can no more be altogether without hope, than they can be altogether without <HI>faith.</HI> Their faith may be very weak, but it <HI>fails not;</HI> and their hope very low, yet they will; and do, <HI>hope to the end.</HI> Even while the godly &s;eem to be carried away with the &s;treams of doubts and fears; there remains &s;till as much <HI>hope</HI> as determines them to lay hold on the tree of life, that grows on the banks of the river. Jonah ii. 4.
<Q>Then I &s;aid, I am ca&s;t out of thy &s;ight: yet I will look again towards thy holy temple.</Q></P>

The world can bear witne&s;s of &s;ignal &s;ettlements made upon <HI>the children of providence;</HI> &s;uch as by their pious parents have been ca&s;t upon God's providential care.

<Q>I am under a &s;ad decay, in re&s;pect of my &s;piritual condition.</Q>
ANSW. Bodily con&s;umptions may make death ea&s;y, but it is not &s;o in &s;piritual decays. I will not &s;ay, that a godly man cannot be in &s;uch a ca&s;e, when he dies; but I believe it is rarely &s;o. Ordinarily (I &s;uppo&s;e) a cry comes to awaken &s;leepy virgins before death come. <HI>Sam&s;on</HI> is &s;et to grind in the pri&s;on, until his locks grow again. <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Solomon</HI> fell under great &s;piritual decays: but, before they died, they recovered their &s;piritual &s;trength and vigour. However, be&s;tir ye your&s;elves without delay, to <HI>&s;trengthen the things that remain:</HI> your fright will be the le&s;s, that ye awake from &s;piritual &s;leep, ere death come to your bed-&s;ide: and you ought to lo&s;e no time, &s;eeing you know not how &s;oon death may &s;eize you.</P>
<P>CASE V.
<Q>It is terrible to think of the other world, that world of &s;pirits which I have &s;o little acquaintance with.</Q>
ANSW. Thy be&s;t friend is Lord of that other world. <HI>Abraham</HI>'s <HI>bo&s;om</HI> is kindly, even to the&s;e who never &s;aw his fac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; After death thy &s;oul becomes capable of conver&s;e with the ble&s;&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> inhabitants of that other world. <HI>The &s;pirits of ju&s;t men made perfect</HI> were once &s;uch as thy &s;pirit now is. And as for the angels, how&s;oever they be of a &s;uperior nature in the rank of beings, yet our nature is dignified above theirs, in the man Chri&s;t: and they are, all of them, thy Lord's &s;ervants, and &s;o thy fellow-&s;ervants.</P>
<P>CASE VI. "The pangs of death are terrible." ANSW. Yet not &s;o terrible as pangs of con&s;cience, cau&s;ed by a piercing &s;en&s;e of guilt, and apprehen&s;ions of divine wrath, with which, I &s;uppo&s;e thee to be not altogether unacquainted. But who would not endure bodily &s;ickne&s;s, that the &s;oul may become &s;ound, and every whit whole? Each pang of death will &s;et &s;in a &s;tep nearer the door; and with the la&s;t breath, the <HI>body of &s;in</HI> will breath out its la&s;t. The pains of death will not la&s;t long; and the Lord thy God will not leave, but &s;upport thee, under them.</P>
<P>CASE VII. "But I am like to be cut off in the mid&s;t of my days." ANSW. Do not complain, you will be the &s;ooner at home: you have
<PB N="244" REF="045042_0241_101F7F94B3EA7760">
thereby the advantage of your fellow-labourers, who were at work before you in the vineyard. God, in the cour&s;e of his providences, hides &s;ome of his &s;aints early in the grave, that they may be taken away from the evil to come. An early removal out of this world prevents much &s;in and mi&s;ery: and they have no ground of complaint, who get <HI>the re&s;idue of their years</HI> in Immanuel's land. Surely thou &s;halt live as long as thou ha&s;t work cut out for thee, by the great Ma&s;ter, to be done for him in this world; and when that is at an end, it is high time to be gone.</P>
<P>CASE VIII. "I am afraid of &s;udden death." ANSW. Thou may indeed die &s;o. Good <HI>Eli</HI> died &s;uddenly, 1 Sam. iv. 18. Yet death found him watching, ver. 12.
<Q>Watch therefore, for ye know not what hour the Lord doth come,</Q>
Matth. xxiv. 42. But be not afraid, it is an unexpre&s;&s;ible comfort, that death, come when it will, can never catch thee out of Chri&s;t; and therefore can never &s;eize thee, as a jailor, to hurry thee into the pri&s;on of hell. Sudden death may ha&s;ten and facilitate thy pa&s;&s;age to heaven, but can do thee no prejudice.</P>
<P>CASE IX.
<Q>I am afraid it may be my lot to die wanting the exerci&s;e of rea&s;on.</Q>
ANSW. I make no que&s;tion but a child of God, a true Chri&s;tian, may die in this ca&s;e. But what harm? There is no hazard in it, as to his eternal &s;tate: a di&s;ea&s;e, at death, may dive&s;t him of his rea&s;on, but not of his religion. When a man going a long voyage, has put his affairs in order, and put all his goods aboard; he him&s;elf may be carried aboard the &s;hip &s;leeping: all is &s;afe with him, although he knows not where he is, till he awaken in the &s;hip. Even &s;o the godly man, who dies in this ca&s;e, may die un|comfortably but not <HI>un&s;afely.</HI></P>
<P>CASE <HI>la&s;t.</HI>
<Q>I am naturally timorous, and the very thoughts of death are terrible to me.</Q>
ANSW. The le&s;s you think on death, the thoughts of it will be the more frightful: but make it familiar to you by frequent meditations upon it, and you may thereby allay your fears. Look at the white and bright &s;ide of the cloud: take faith's view of the <HI>city that hath foundations:</HI> &s;o &s;hall you &s;ee <HI>hope in your death.</HI> Be duly affected with the body of &s;in and death, and frequent interruptions of your communion with God, and with the glory which dwells on the other &s;ide death: this will contribute much to remove &s;lavi&s;h fear.</P>
<P>It is pity &s;aints &s;hould be &s;o fond of life as they often are: they ought always to be in good terms with death. When matters are duly con&s;idered, it might well be expected every child of God, every regenerate man, &s;hould generou&s;ly profe&s;s concerning this life, what <HI>Job</HI> did, chap. vii. 16. <HI>I lothe it, I would not live always.</HI> In order to gain their hearts to this de&s;irable temper, I offer the following additional con&s;iderations.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Con&s;ider <HI>the &s;infulne&s;s</HI> that attends life in this world&punc; While ye live here, ye &s;in, and &s;ee others &s;inning. Ye brea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

infectious air. Ye live in a pe&s;t hou&s;e. Is it at all &s;trange to lothe &s;uch a life? (1.) Your <HI>own pilgrim's &s;ores</HI> are running on you. Doth not the &s;in of your nature make you groan daily? Are you not &s;en&s;ible, that though the cure be begun, it is yet far from being perfected? Has not the lepro&s;y got into the walls of the hou&s;e, which cannot be removed without pulling it down? Is not your nature &s;o vitiate, that no le&s;s than the &s;eparation of the &s;oul from the body can root out the di&s;ea&s;e? Have you not your &s;ores <HI>with|out,</HI> as well as your &s;ickne&s;s <HI>within?</HI> Do ye not leave marks of your pollution, on what&s;oever pa&s;&s;es through your hands? Are not all your actions tainted and blemi&s;hed with defects and imperfections? Who el&s;e then &s;hould be much in love with life, but &s;uch who&s;e &s;ickne&s;s is their health, and who <HI>glory in their &s;hame?</HI> (2.) The loath&s;ome <HI>&s;ores of others</HI> are always before your eyes, go where you will. The follies and wickedne&s;s of men are every where con&s;pi|cuous, and make but an unplea&s;ant &s;cene. The &s;inful world is but an un&s;ightly company, a di&s;agreeable croud, in which the mo&s;t loath|&s;ome are the mo&s;t numerous. (3.) Are not your own &s;ores oft|times <HI>breaking out again,</HI> after hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing? Frequent relap&s;es may well cau&s;e us remit of our fondne&s;s for this life. To be ever &s;truggling, and anon falling into the mire again, makes weary work. Do ye never <HI>wi&s;h</HI> for cold death, thereby effectually to cool the heat of the&s;e lu&s;ts, which &s;o often take fire again; even after a flood of godly &s;orrow has gone over them? (4.) Do not ye &s;ometimes <HI>infect others,</HI> and others <HI>infect you?</HI> There is no &s;ociety in the world, in which every member of it doth not &s;ometimes lay a &s;tumbling-block before the re&s;t. The be&s;t carry about with them the <HI>tinder</HI> of a corrupt nature, which they cannot be rid of while they live, and which is liable to be <HI>kindled</HI> at all <HI>times,</HI> and in all <HI>places;</HI> yea, they are apt to <HI>inflame</HI> others, and become the <HI>occa&s;ions</HI> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ning. Certainly the&s;e things are apt to imbitter this life to the &s;aints.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Con&s;ider the <HI>mi&s;ery</HI> and <HI>trouble</HI> that attend it. Re&s;t is de&s;irable, but it is not to be found on this &s;ide of the grave. Worldly troubles attend <HI>all</HI> men in this life. This world is a &s;ea of trouble, where one wave rolls upon another. They, who fancy them&s;elves beyond the reach of trouble, are mi&s;taken: no &s;tate, no &s;tage of life, is exempted from it. The crowned head is &s;urrounded with thorny cares. Honour many times paves the way to deep di&s;grace: riches, for the mo&s;t part, are kept to the hurt of the owners. The faire&s;t ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e wants not prickles; and the heavie&s;t cro&s;s is &s;ometimes found wrapt up in the greate&s;t earthly comfort. Spiritual troubles attend the <HI>&s;aints</HI> in this life. They are like travellers in a cloudy night, in which the moon &s;ometimes breaks out from under one cloud, but quickly hides her head again under another: no wonder they long to be at their journey's end. The &s;udden alterations the be&s;t frame of &s;pirit is liable to, the perplexing doubts, confound|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g fears, &s;hort-liv'd joys, and long-running &s;orrows, which have
<PB N="246" REF="045042_0243_101F7F97C7875288">
a certain affinity with the pre&s;ent life, mu&s;t needs create in the &s;aints a de&s;ire to be with Chri&s;t, which is be&s;t of all.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> Con&s;ider the great <HI>imperfections</HI> attending this life. While the &s;oul is lodged in this cottage of <HI>clay,</HI> the nece&s;&s;ities of the body are many; it is always craving. The mud-walls mu&s;t be repaired and patched up daily, till the clay-cottage fall down for good and all. Eating, drinking, &s;leeping, and the like, are, in them&s;elves, but mean employments for a rational creature; and will be reputed &s;uch by the heaven-born &s;oul. They are badges of <HI>imperfection,</HI> and, as &s;uch, unplea&s;ant to the mind, a&s;piring unto that life and im|mortality, which is brought to light through the go&s;pel: and would be very grievous, if this &s;tate of things were of long con|tinuance. Doth not the gracious &s;oul often find it&s;elf yoked with the <HI>body,</HI> as with a companion in travel, unable to keep pace with it? When the &s;pirit is willing, the fle&s;h is weak. When the &s;oul would mount upward, the body is as a clog upon it, and as a &s;tone tied to the foot of a bird attempting to fly. The truth is, O belie|ver! thy &s;oul in this body is, at be&s;t, but like a diamond in a ring, where much of it is ob&s;cured: it is far &s;unk in <HI>the vile clay,</HI> till re|lieved by death.</P>
<P>I conclude this &s;ubject with a few <HI>directions</HI> how to <HI>prepare</HI> for death, &s;o as we may die <HI>comfortably.</HI> I &s;peak not here of <HI>habitual preparation</HI> for death, which a true Chri&s;tian, in virtue of his gra|cious <HI>&s;tate,</HI> never wants, from the time he is born again and united to Chri&s;t; but of <HI>actual preparation</HI> or <HI>readine&s;s</HI> in re&s;pect of his cir|cum&s;tantiate ca&s;e, frame, and di&s;po&s;ition of mind and &s;pirit; the want of which makes even a &s;aint very <HI>unfit</HI> to die.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Let it be your con&s;tant care to keep a <HI>clean</HI> con&s;cience, <HI>a con&s;cience void of offence toward God, and toward man,</HI> Acts xxiv. 17. Beware of a &s;tanding controver&s;y betwixt God and you, on the account of &s;ome iniquity regarded in the heart. When an hone&s;t man is about to leave his country, and not to return, he &s;ettles accompts with tho&s;e he had dealings with, and lays down methods for paying his debts timeou&s;ly; le&s;t he be reckoned a bankrupt, and be attacked by an officer, when he is going off. Guilt lying on the con&s;cience is a fountain of fears; and will readily &s;ting &s;everely, when death &s;tares the criminal in the face. Hence it is, that many, even of God's children, when a dying, are made to wi&s;h pa&s;&s;ion|ately, and de&s;ire eagerly that they may live to do, what they ought to have done, before that time. Wherefore, walk clo&s;ely with God, be diligent, &s;trict and exact in your cour&s;e; beware of a loo&s;e, carele&s;s, and irregular conver&s;ation: as ye would not lay up for your&s;elves, angui&s;h and bitterne&s;s of &s;pirit, in a dying hour. And becau&s;e, through the infirmity cleaving to us, in our pre&s;ent &s;tate of imperfection, <HI>in many things we offend all,</HI> renew your repentance daily, and be ever wa&s;hing in the Redeemer's blood. As long as ye are in the world, ye will need <HI>to wa&s;h your feet,</HI> John xiii. 10.
<PB N="247" REF="045042_0244_101F7F9972CF0CB0">
that is, to make application to the blood of Chri&s;t, anew, for purg|ing your con&s;ciences from the guilt of daily mi&s;carriages. Let death find you at the fountain; and if &s;o, it will find you ready to an&s;wer its call.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Be always watchful, waiting for your change,
<Q>Like unto men that wait for their Lord, that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open unto him immediately.</Q>
Luke xxi. 36. Beware of <HI>&s;lumbering and &s;leeping, while the bridegroom tarries.</HI> To be awakened out of &s;piritual &s;lumber, by a &s;urprizing call to pa&s;s into a another world, is a very fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ghtful thing: but he who is daily <HI>for the coming of his Lord,</HI> &s;hall comfortably receive the grim me&s;&s;enger, while he beholds him u&s;hering in Him, of whom he may confidently &s;ay, <HI>This is my God, and I have waited for him.</HI> The way to die comfortable, is to <HI>die daily.</HI> Be often e&s;&s;aying (as it were) to die. Bring your&s;elves familiarly acquainted with death, by making many vi&s;its to the grave, in &s;erious meditations upon it. This was <HI>Job's</HI> practice, chap. xvii. 13, 14. <HI>I have made my bed in the darkne&s;s.</HI> Go thou, and do likewi&s;e; and when death comes, thou &s;halt have nothing ado but to ly down <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> "I have &s;aid to corruption, thou art my father; to the worm, thou art my mother and my &s;i&s;ter." Do thou &s;ay &s;o too; and thou wilt be the fitter to go home to their hou&s;e. Be frequently reflecting upon your conduct, and con&s;ider|ing what cour&s;e of life you wi&s;h to be found in when death arre&s;ts you: and act accordingly. When you do the duties of your &s;tation in life, or are employed in acts of wor&s;hip, think with your&s;elves, that, it may be, this is the la&s;t oppertunity: and therefore act as if you was never to do more of that kind. When you ly down at night, compo&s;e your &s;pirits as if you was not to awake till the heavens be no more. And when you awake in the morning, con|&s;ider that new day as your la&s;t, and live accordingly. Surely that night cometh, of which you will never &s;ee the morning; or that morning, of which you will never &s;ee the night. But which of your mornings or nights, will be &s;uch, you know not.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Employ your&s;elves much in <HI>weaning</HI> your hearts from the world. The man who is making ready to go abroad, bu&s;ies him&s;elf in taking leave of his friends. Let the mantle of earthly enjoyments hang loo&s;e about you, that it may be ea&s;ily dropt, when death comes to carry you away into another world. Moderate your affections towards your lawful comforts of life: and let not your hearts be too much taken with them. The traveller acts un|wi&s;ely, who &s;uffers him&s;elf to be &s;o allured with the conveniencies of the inn where he lodgeth, as to make his nece&s;&s;ary departure from it grievous. Feed with fear, and walk thro' the world as pilgrims and &s;trangers. Likeas, when the corn is for&s;aking the ground, it is ready for the &s;ickle: when the fruit is ripe, it falls off the tree ea&s;ily: &s;o, when a Chri&s;tian's heart is truly weaned from the world, he is prepared for death, and it will be the more
<PB N="248" REF="045042_0245_101F7FA0A561B7A8">
ea&s;y to him. A heart di&s;engaged from the world is an heavenly one: and then are we ready for heaven, when <HI>our heart is there</HI> before us, Matth. vi. 21.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> Be diligent in gathering and laying up <HI>evidences</HI> of your title to heaven, for your &s;upport and comfort at the hour of death. The neglect hereof mars the joy and con&s;olation which &s;ome Chri&s;|tians might otherwi&s;e have at their death. Wherefore examine your&s;elves frequently, as to your &s;piritual &s;tate; that evidences, which ly hid and unob&s;erved, may be brought to light and taken notice of. And if you would manage this work &s;ucce&s;sfully, make &s;olemn &s;erious work of it. Set apart &s;ome time for it. And, after earne&s;t prayer to God, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for the enlightning influences of the Holy Spirit, whereby ye may be enabled to un|der&s;tand his own <HI>word,</HI> to di&s;cern his own <HI>work</HI> in your &s;ouls; &s;i&s;t your&s;elves before the tribunal of your con&s;ciences, that ye may judge your&s;elves in this weighty matter.</P>
<P>And in the fir&s;t place, Let the marks of a regenerate &s;tate be fixed, from the Lord's word: and have recour&s;e to &s;ome particu|lar text for that purpo&s;e; &s;uch as Prov. viii. 17. "I love them that love me." Compare Luke xiv. 26. "If any man come to me, and hate not his father and mother, and wife and children, and brethren and &s;i&s;ters, yea, and his own life al&s;o, he cannot be my di&s;ciple." P&s;al. cxix. 6.
<Q>Then &s;hall I not be a&s;hamed, when I have re&s;pect unto all thy commandments. P&s;al. xviii. 23. I was al&s;o upright before him: and I kept my&s;elf from mine iniquity.</Q>
Compare Rom. vii. 22, 23.
<Q>For I delight in the law of God, after the in|wardman: but I &s;ee another law in my members warring again&s;t the law of my mind, &amp;c. 1 John iii. 3. And every man that hath this hope in him, purifieth him&s;elf, even as he is pure, Matth. v. 3. Ble&s;&s;ed are the poor in &s;pirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Phil. iii. 3. For we are the circumci&s;ion which wor&s;hip (<HI>or</HI> &s;erve) God in the &s;pirit, and rejoice in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and have no confidence in the fle&s;h.</Q>
The &s;um of the evidence ari&s;ing from the&s;e texts, lies here. A real Chri&s;tian is one who loves God for him&s;elf, as well as for his benefits: and that with a &s;upreme love, above all per&s;ons and all things: he has an awful and impartial re|gard to God's commands: he oppo&s;eth and wre&s;tleth again&s;t that &s;in, which of all others mo&s;t ea&s;ily be&s;ets him: he approveth and loveth the holy law, even in that very point, wherein it &s;trikes again&s;t his mo&s;t beloved lu&s;t: his hope of heaven engageth him in the &s;tudy of univer&s;al holine&s;s; in the which he aims at perfection, though he cannot reach it in this life: he &s;erves the Lord, not only in acts of wor&s;hip, but in the whole of his conver&s;ation; and as to both, is &s;piritual in the principle, motives, aims, and ends of his &s;ervice: yet he &s;ees nothing in him&s;elf to tru&s;t to before the Lord: Chri&s;t and his fulne&s;s is the &s;tay of his &s;oul: and his confi|dence is cut off from all that is not Chri&s;t, or in Chri&s;t, in point

On this occa&s;ion he profe&s;&s;eth him&s;elf not only Lord of the <HI>Sabbath,</HI> but al&s;o Lord of life and death; declaring in the words of the text, the <HI>re&s;urrection</HI> of the <HI>dead</HI> to be brought to pa&s;s by his power. This he introduceth with the&s;e words, as with a &s;olemn preface: <HI>Marvel not at this: i. e</HI> at this &s;trange di&s;cour&s;e of mine: do not wonder to hear me, who&s;e appear|ance is &s;o very mean in your eyes, talk at this rate: for the day is coming, in which the <HI>dead</HI> &s;hall be <HI>rai&s;ed</HI> by my power.</P>

It was to &s;pare you, that I neglected opportunities of making peace with God, loitered away &s;abbaths, lived in the neglect of prayer, went to the hou&s;e of mirth, rather than to the hou&s;e of mourning; and that I chu&s;ed to deny Chri&s;t, and for&s;ake his cau&s;e and intere&s;ts in the world; and &s;o am fallen a &s;acrifice to your cur&s;ed ea&s;e.

<Q>The Lord of heaven doth now, in mercy, hold back the face of his throne, and &s;preadeth his cloud upon it;</Q>
that mortals may not be confounded with the rays of glory, which &s;hine forth from it, Job xxvi 9. But then the vail &s;hall be removed, and they made able to behold it, to their un&s;peakable joy.

<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> They &s;hall be <HI>&s;piritual</HI> bodies.

There will be no need to <HI>beat it down,</HI> nor to drag it to the &s;ervice of God. The &s;oul, in this life, is &s;o much influenced by the body, that in Scripture-&s;tyle, it is &s;aid to be <HI>carnal:</HI> but then, the body &s;hall be <HI>&s;piritual,</HI> readily &s;erving the &s;oul in the bu&s;ine&s;s of heaven; and in that only, as if it had no more relation of earth, than a &s;pirit.

<P>As to the <HI>qualities</HI> of the bodies of the <HI>wicked,</HI> at the re&s;urrection, I find the Scripture &s;peaks but little of them.

Their &s;hame will be too deep for blu&s;hes but "all faces &s;hall gather black|ne&s;s," at that day, when they &s;hall go forth of their graves, as male|factors out of their pri&s;ons to execution; for their re&s;urrection is the re&s;urrection of <HI>damnation.</HI> The greate&s;t beauties, who now pride them&s;elves in their comeline&s;s of body not regarding their deformed &s;ouls, will then appear with gha&s;tly countenances, a grim and death-like vi&s;age. Their looks will be frightful, and they will be horrible &s;pectacles, coming forth of their graves like infernal furies out of the pit. They &s;hall ri&s;e al&s;o to <HI>everla&s;ting contempt.</HI> They &s;hall then be the mo&s;t contemptible creatures, filled with contempt from God&punc; as <HI>ve&s;&s;els of di&s;honour:</HI> whatever honourable u&s;es they have been em|ployed to, in this world; and filled al&s;o with contempt from men.

It was crackt, it was polluted; and therefore it behoved to be melted down that it may be refined and fa&s;hioned more gloriou&s;ly. Do but wait a while, and you &s;hall &s;ee it come forth out of the <HI>furnace of earth,</HI> vying with the &s;tars in brightne&s;s; nay, <HI>as the &s;un when he goeth forth in his might.</HI> Have you laid your <HI>infant</HI> children in the grave? You will &s;ee them again. Your God calls him&s;elf <HI>the God of your &s;eed;</HI> which, according to our Saviour's expo&s;ition, &s;ecures the glorious <HI>re&s;urrection</HI> of the body. Where|fore let the covenant you embraced, for your&s;elf, and your babes now in the du&s;t, comfort your hearts, in the joyful expectation, that, by virtue thereof, they &s;hall be rai&s;ed up in glory; and that, as being no more <HI>infants of days,</HI> but brought to a full and perfect &s;tature, as is generally &s;uppo&s;ed.

<P>USE II. Of <HI>terror</HI> to all unregenerate men. Ye who are yet in your natural &s;tate, look at this piece of the eternal &s;tate; and con|&s;ider what will be your part in it, if ye be not in time brought into the &s;tate of grace. Think, O &s;inner, on that day, when the trum|pet &s;hall &s;ound, at the voice of which, the bars of the pit &s;hall be broken a&s;under, the doors of the grave &s;hall fly open, the devour|ing depths of the &s;ea &s;hall throw up their dead, the earth ca&s;t forth hers; and death every where in the exce&s;s of a&s;toni&s;hment, &s;hall let go its pri&s;oners; and thy wretched &s;oul and body &s;hall be re-united, to be &s;i&s;ted before the tribunal of God. Then, if thou had&s;t a thou|&s;and worlds at thy di&s;po&s;al, thou would&s;t gladly give them all away, upon condition thou mighte&s;t ly &s;till in thy grave, with the hund|redth part of that ea&s;e, wherewith thou ha&s;t &s;ometimes lain at home, on the Lord's day: or (if that cannot be obtained) that thou might|e&s;t be but a &s;pectator of the tran&s;actions of that day; as thou ha&s;t been at &s;ome &s;olemn occa&s;ions, and rich go&s;pel fea&s;ts: or (if even that is not to be purcha&s;ed) that a mountain or a rock might fall on thee, and cover thee from the face of the Lamb. Ah! how are men bewitched, thus to trifle away the precious time of life, in (almo&s;t) as little concern about death, as if they were like the bea&s;ts that peri&s;h! &s;ome will be telling where their corp&s;e mu&s;t be laid; while yet they have not &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;idered, whether their graves &s;hall be their beds, where they &s;hall awake with joy in the morn|ing of the re&s;urrection; or their pri&s;ons, out of which they &s;hall be brought to receive the fearful &s;entence. Remember, now is your &s;eed-time; and as ye &s;ow, ye &s;hall reap. God's &s;eed-time begins at death; and at the re&s;urrection, the bodies of the wicked, that were &s;own <HI>full of &s;ins, that ly down with them in the du&s;t,</HI> (Job xx 11.) &s;hall &s;pring up again, &s;inful, wretched, and vile. Your bo|dies, which are now in&s;truments of &s;in, the Lord will lay a&s;ide for
<PB N="266" REF="045042_0263_101F7FD89E7F7AD8">
the fire, at death; and bring them forth for the fire, at the re&s;ur|rection. That body, which is not now employed in God's &s;ervice, but is abu&s;ed by uncleanne&s;s and la&s;civiou&s;ne&s;s, will then be brought forth in all its vilene&s;s, thenceforth to lodge with unclean &s;pirits. The body of the drunkard &s;hall then &s;tagger by rea&s;on of the wine of the wrath of God, poured out to him, and poured into him, without mixture. The&s;e, who now plea&s;e them&s;elves in their revellings, will reel to and fro at another rate; when, in&s;tead of their &s;ongs and mu&s;ick, they &s;hall hear the &s;ound of the la&s;t trumpet. Many toil their bodies for worldly gain, who will be loth to di&s;tre&s;s them for the benefit of their &s;ouls; by labour, unrea&s;onably hard, they will quite disfit them for the &s;ervice of God; and, when they have done, will reckon it a very good rea&s;on for &s;hifting duty, that they are already tired out with other bu&s;ine&s;s: but the day cometh, when they will be made to abide a yet greater &s;tre&s;s. They will go &s;everal miles for back and belley, who will not go half the way for the good of their immortal &s;ouls; they will be &s;ickly and unable on the Lord's day, who will be tolerably well all the re&s;t of the week. But when that trumpet &s;ounds, the dead &s;hall find their feet, and none &s;hall be mi&s;&s;ing in that great congregation. When the bodies of the &s;aints &s;hine as the &s;un, fearful will the looks of their <HI>per&s;ecutors</HI> be. Fearful will their condition be, who &s;ometimes &s;hut up the &s;aints in na&s;ty pri&s;ons, &s;tigmatized, burned them to a&s;hes, hanged them, and &s;tuck up their heads and hands in publick places, to fright others from the ways of righteou&s;ne&s;s, which they &s;uf|fered for. Many faces now fair, will then <HI>gather blackne&s;s.</HI> They &s;hall be no more admired and care&s;&s;ed for that beauty, which has a worm at the root, that will cau&s;e it to i&s;&s;ue in loth&s;omne&s;s and deformity. Ah! what is that <HI>beauty,</HI> under which there lurks a mon&s;truous, deformed, and gracele&s;s heart? What but a &s;orry paint, a &s;light varni&s;h; which will leave the body &s;o much the more ugly, before that <HI>flaming-fire,</HI> in which the Judge &s;hall be <HI>revealed from heaven, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the go&s;pel,</HI> 2 The&s;&s;. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. 7, 8. They &s;hall be &s;tript of all their ornaments, and not have a rag to cover their nakedne&s;s: but their carca&s;es &s;hall be <HI>an abhorring</HI> to all fle&s;h, and &s;erve as a foil to &s;et off the beauty and glory of the righteous, and make it appear the brighter.</P>
<P>Now is the time to &s;ecure, for your&s;elves, a part in the re&s;ur|rection of the ju&s;t. The which if ye would do, unite with Je&s;us Chri&s;t by faith, ri&s;ing &s;piritually from &s;in, and glorifying God with your bodies He is <HI>the re&s;urrection and the life,</HI> John xi. 25. If your bodies be members of Chri&s;t, <HI>temples of the Holy Gho&s;t;</HI> they &s;hall certainly ari&s;e in glory. Get into this ark now, and ye &s;hall come forth with joy into the new world. Ri&s;e from your &s;ins: ca&s;t away the&s;e grave-clothes, putting off your former lu&s;ts. How can one imagine, that the&s;e, who continue <HI>dead while they live,</HI> &s;hall <HI>come forth,</HI> at the la&s;t day, <HI>unto the re&s;urrection of life?</HI> But that will be
<PB N="267" REF="045042_0264_101F7FDA70302E80">
the privilege of all tho&s;e, who having fir&s;t con&s;ecrated their &s;ouls and bodies to the Lord by faith, do glorify him with their bodies, as well as their &s;ouls; living and acting to him, and for him, yea, and &s;uffering for him too, when he calls them to it.</P>

<P>THE dead being <HI>rai&s;ed,</HI> and the&s;e found alive at the coming of the Judge, <HI>changed,</HI> follows the <HI>General Judgment,</HI> plainly and awfully de&s;cribed in this portion of Scripture; in which we &s;hall take notice of the following particulars. (1.) The coming of the Judge, <HI>When the Son of man &s;hall come in his glory,</HI> &amp;c. The Judge is Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>the Son of man;</HI> the &s;ame, by who&s;e almighty power, as he is God, the dead will be rai&s;ed. He is al&s;o called <HI>the King,</HI> ver. 34. The judging of the world being an act of the Royal Mediator's kingly office. He will come <HI>in glory;</HI> glorious in his own Per&s;on, and having a glorious retinue, even <HI>all the holy angels with him,</HI> to mini&s;ter unto him at this great &s;olemnity. (2.) The Judge's mounting the tribunal. He is a King, and therefore it is a throne, a glorious throne, <HI>&s;hall &s;it upon the throne of his glory,</HI> ver. 31. (3.) The compearance of the parties. The&s;e are <HI>all nations;</HI> all and every one, &s;ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l and great, of what&s;oever nation, who ever were, are, or &s;hall be on the face of

the earth; all &s;hall be <HI>gathered before him;</HI> &s;i&s;ted before his tribunal. (4.) The &s;orting of them: <HI>He &s;hall &s;eparate</HI> the elect <HI>Sheep,</HI> and reprobate <HI>goats,</HI> &s;etting each party by them&s;elves: as a <HI>Shepherd</HI> who feeds his &s;heep and goats together all the day, &s;eparates them at night, ver. 32. The godly he will &s;et <HI>on his right hand,</HI> as the mo&s;t hon|ourable place; the wicked <HI>on the left,</HI> ver 33. Yet &s;o as they &s;hall be both <HI>before him,</HI> ver. 32. It &s;eems to be an allu&s;ion to a cu&s;tom in the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> courts, in which, one &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t at the right hand of the Judge, who wrote the &s;entence of ab&s;olution; another at their left, who wrote the &s;entence of condemnation. (5) The &s;entencing of the parties, and that according to their works; the righteous being ab|&s;olved, and the wicked condemned, ver 34, 41. <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> The exe|cution of both &s;entences, in the driving away of the wicked into hell, and carrying the godly to heaven, ver. 49.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD><HI>DOCTRINE.</HI> There &s;hall be a general Judgment.</HEAD>
<P>This doctrine I &s;hall, (1.) confirm, (2.) explain: and (3.) apply.</P>
<P N="1">I. For confirmation of this great truth, that there &s;hall be a general judgment.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> It is evident from plain Scripture-te&s;timonies. The world has, in all ages been told of it. <HI>Enoch,</HI> before the flood, taught it in his prophecy, related Jude, ver. 14, 15.
<Q>Behold the Lord cometh with ten thou&s;and of his &s;aints, to execute judgment upon all,</Q>
&amp;c. <HI>Daniel</HI> de&s;cribes it, chap. vii. 9, 10.
<Q>I beheld till the thrones were ca&s;t down, and the Ancient of days did &s;it, who&s;e garments was white as &s;now, and the hair of his head like pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire. A fiery &s;tream i&s;&s;ued and came forth from before him: thou&s;and thou&s;ands &s;tood before him: the judgment was &s;et, and the books were opened.</Q>
The Apo&s;tle is very expre&s;s, Acts xvii. 31.
<Q>He hath appointed a day in the which he will judge the world in righteou&s;|ne&s;s, by that Man whom he hath ordained.</Q>
See Matth xvi. 27. 2 Cor. v. 10. 2 The&s;&s;. i 7, 8, 9, 10. Rev. xx. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. God has not only &s;aid it, but he has &s;worn it, Rom. xiv. 10, 11.
<Q>We mu&s;t all &s;tand before the judgment-&s;eat of Chri&s;t: For it is written, As I live, &s;aith the Lord, every knee &s;hall bow to me, and every tongue &s;hall confe&s;s to God.</Q>
So that the truth of God is mo&s;t &s;olemnly plighted for it.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The rectoral ju&s;tice and goodne&s;s of God, the &s;overeign Ruler of the world, do nece&s;&s;arily require it, ina&s;much as they require its being well with the righteous, and ill with the wicked. Howbeit, we often now &s;ee wickedne&s;s exalted&punc; while truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s fall in the &s;treets; piety oppre&s;&s;ed, while profanity and irrelig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n do triumph. This is &s;o very ordinary, that every one, who &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cerely
<PB N="269" REF="045042_0266_101F7FE34E4B9390">
embraceth the way of holine&s;s, mu&s;t, and doth lay his account with the lo&s;s of all he has, which the world can take away from him. Luke xiv. 26.
<Q>If any man come to me, and hate not his father and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and &s;i&s;ters, yea, and his own life al&s;o, he cannot be my di&s;ciple.</Q>
But it is con&s;i&s;tent with the ju&s;tice and goodne&s;s of God, that the affairs of men &s;hould always cuntinue in this &s;tate, which they appear in, from one genera|tion to another; but that every man be rewarded according to his works: and &s;ince that is not done in this life, there mu&s;t be a judg|ment to come:
<Q>Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recom|pence tribulation to them that trouble you: and to you who are troubled, re&s;t with us, when the Lord Je&s;us &s;hall be revealed from heaven,</Q>
2 The&s;&s;. i. 6, 7. There will be a day, in which the tables will be turned; and the wicked &s;hall be called to an account for all their &s;ins, and &s;uffer the due puni&s;hment of them; and the pious &s;hall be the pro&s;perous; for, as the Apo&s;tle argues for the happy re&s;urrection of the &s;aints,
<Q>If in this life only we have hope in Chri&s;t, we are of all men mo&s;t mi&s;erable,</Q>
1 Cor xv. 19. It is true, God &s;ometimes puni&s;heth the wicked, in this life; that men may know,
<Q>he is a God that judgeth in the earth:</Q>
but yet much wickedne&s;s remains un|puni&s;hed, and undi&s;covered; to be a <HI>pledge</HI> of the judgment to come. If <HI>none</HI> of the wicked were puni&s;hed here, they would conclude that God had utterly for&s;aken the earth; if all of them were puni&s;hed in this life, men would be apt to think, there is no after-reckoning. Therefore, in the wi&s;dom of God, &s;ome are puni&s;hed now, and &s;ome not. Sometimes the Lord &s;mites &s;inners, in the very act of &s;in; to &s;hew unto the world, that he is witne&s;s to all their wickedne&s;s&punc; and will call him to an account for it. Sometimes he delays long, ere he &s;trike; that he may di&s;cover to the world, that he forgets not men<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ill deeds, though he does not pre&s;ently puni&s;h them. Be&s;ides all this, the &s;ins of many do <HI>out live</HI> them; and the impure fountain, by them opened, runs long after they are dead and gone. As in the ca&s;e of <HI>Jeroboam</HI> the fir&s;t king of the ten tribes; who&s;e &s;in did run on all along unto the end of that unhappy kingdom, 2 Kings xvii. 22.
<Q>The children of I&s;rael walked in all the &s;ins of Jeroboam, which he did; they departed not from them: Ver. 23. Until the Lord removed I&s;rael out of his &s;ight.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t is a certain proof, that there &s;hall be a day of judgment. This argument <HI>Paul</HI> u&s;eth, to con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ince the <HI>Atheniens:</HI> &s;ays he,
<Q>He hath given a&s;&s;urance to all men, in that he hath rai&s;ed him from the dead,</Q>
Acts xvii. 31. The Judge is already named, his patent written and &s;ealed, yea, and rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> before all men, in his ri&s;ing again from the dead. Hereby God hath given <HI>a&s;&s;urance</HI> of it. (or <HI>offered faith,</HI> Marg.) He hath, by rai&s;ing Chri&s;t from the dead, <HI>exhibited his credentials</HI> as Judge of the world. When, in the days of his humiliation, he was &s;ifted before a tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> arraigned, accu&s;ed and condemned of men; he plainly told them of thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>judgment,</HI>
<PB N="270" REF="045042_0267_101F7FE658C68398">
and that he him&s;elf would be the Judge. Matth xxvi. 64.
<Q>Hereafter &s;hall ye &s;ee the Son of man &s;itting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</Q>
And now that he was rai&s;ed from the dead, tho' condemned as a bla&s;phemer on this very head; is it not an undeniable proof, from heaven, of the truth of what he a&s;&s;erted? Moreover, this was one of the great ends of Chri&s;t's death and re&s;urrection:
<Q>For to this end Chri&s;t both died and ro&s;e, and revived, that he might be the Lord (i.e. <HI>The Lord Judge,</HI> as is evident from the context) both of the dead and of the living,</Q>
Rom. xiv. 9.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> Every man bears about with him a witne&s;s to this within his own brea&s;t, Rom. ii. 15.
<Q>Which &s;hew the work of the law written in their hearts, their con&s;cience al&s;o bearing witne&s;s, and their thoughts the mean while accu&s;ing, or el&s;e excu&s;ing one another.</Q>
There is a tribunal erected within every man, where con&s;cience is accu&s;er, witne&s;s, and judge, binding over the &s;inner to the judgment of God. This fills the mo&s;t profligate wretches with horror, and inwardly &s;tings them, upon the commi&s;&s;ion of &s;ome atroci|ous crime; in effect &s;ummoning them to an&s;wer for it, before the the Judge of the quick and dead. And this it doth, even when the crime is <HI>&s;ecret,</HI> and hid from the eyes of the world It reacheth tho&s;e whom the laws of men cannot reach, becau&s;e of their power or craft. When men have fled from the judgment of their fellow-creatures; yet, go where they will, <HI>con&s;cience,</HI> as the &s;upreme Judge's officer, &s;till keeps hold of them, re&s;erving them in its chains to the judgment of the great day. And whether they e&s;cape puni&s;hment from men, or fall by the hand of public ju&s;tice, when they perceive death's ap|proach, they hear from within, of this after-reckoning; being con|&s;trained to hearken thereto, in the&s;e the mo&s;t &s;erious minutes of their life. If there be &s;ome, in whom nothing of this doth appear, we have no more ground thence to conclude again&s;t it, than we have to conclude, that becau&s;e &s;ome men do not groan, therefore they have no pain; or that dying is a mere je&s;t, becau&s;e there have been, who have &s;eemed to make little el&s;e of it. A good face may be put upon an ill con&s;cience: and the more hopele&s;s men's ca&s;e is, they reckon it the more their intere&s;t to make no reflections on their &s;tate and ca&s;e. But every one, who will con&s;ult him&s;elf &s;eriou&s;ly, &s;hall find in him&s;elf the witne&s;s to the judgment to come. Even the heathens wanted not a notion of it, though mixed with fictions of their own. Hence, though &s;ome of the <HI>Athenians, when they heard of the re&s;urrection of the dead, mocked,</HI> Acts xvii. 32. yet there is no account of their mocking, when they heard of the <HI>general judgment,</HI> ver 31.</P>
<P N="2">II. For explication, the following particulars may &s;erve to give &s;ome view of the nature and tran&s;actions of that great day.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> God &s;hall judge the world by Je&s;us Chri&s;t. <HI>He will judge the world in righteou&s;ne&s;s, by that Man whom he hath ordained,</HI> Acts xvii. 31. The P&s;almi&s;t tells us, that <HI>God is judge him&s;elf,</HI> P&s;al. I. 6.

The judgment &s;hall be exerci&s;ed or performed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> as the Royal Mediator; for he has a delegated power of judgment from the Father, as his &s;ervant, <HI>his King,</HI> whom he hath <HI>&s;et upon the holy hill of Zion,</HI> (P&s;al. ii 6.) and to whom he <HI>hath com|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> all judgment,</HI> John v. 22. This is a part of the Mediator's exaltation, given him, in con&s;equence of his voluntary humiliation, Philip ii. 8, 9, 10. <HI>He humbled him&s;elf, and become obedient unto death, even the death of the cro&s;s. Wherefore God hath al&s;o highly exalted him, and given him a name, which is above every name, (i.e.)</HI> power and authority over all, to wit) <HI>That at (or in) the name of Je&s;us</HI> (not, the name of Je&s;us; that is not the name above every name, being common to others, as to <HI>Ju&s;tus,</HI> Col. iv. 11. and <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> Heb iv. 8) <HI>every knee &s;hall how.</HI> The which is explained by the Apo&s;tle him&s;elf, of <HI>&s;tanding before the judgment-&s;eat of Chri&s;t,</HI> Rom. xiv.10, 11. So he who was judged and condemned of men, &s;hall be the <HI>Judge</HI> of men and angels.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Je&s;us Chri&s;t the Judge, de&s;cending from heaven into the air, (1 The&s;&s;. iv. 16, 17) &s;hall <HI>come in the clouds of heaven, with power and great glory,</HI> Matth. xxiv. 30. This his coming will be a mighty &s;urprize to the world, which will be found in deep &s;ecurity: fool<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;h virgins &s;leeping, and the wi&s;e &s;lumbering. There will then be much luxury and debauchery in the world, little &s;obriety and watchfulne&s;s; a great throng of bu&s;ine&s;s, but a great &s;carcity of faith and holine&s;s.
<Q>As it was in the days of Noah, &s;o al&s;o &s;hall it be in days of the Son of man. They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark: and the flood came and de&s;troyed them all. Likewi&s;e al&s;o as it was in the days of Lot: they did eat, they drank, they bought, they &s;old, they planted, they builded.&mdash;Even thus &s;hall it be in the day, when the Son of man is revealed.</Q>
Luke xvii. 26, 27, 28, 30. The coming of the Judge will &s;urpri&s;e &s;ome at markets, buying and &s;elling; others at table, eating and drinking, and making merry: others bu&s;y with their new plantings; &s;ome building new hou&s;es; nay, &s;ome's wedding-day will be their own, and the world's judgment-day. But the Judge cometh! the markets are marred; the buyer throws away what he has bought; the &s;eller ca&s;ts down his money: they are rai&s;ed from the table, and their mirth is extingui&s;hed in a moment; tho' the tree be &s;et in the earth, the gardner may not &s;tay to ca&s;t the earth about it; the workmen throw away their tools, when the hou&s;e is half built, and the owner regards it no more; the bridegroom, bride, and gue&s;ts mu&s;t leave the wedding-fea&s;t, and appear before the tribunal: for, <HI>Behold he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">eth with clouds, and every eye &s;hall &s;ee him,</HI> Rev. i. 7. He &s;hall come mo&s;t gloriou&s;ly: for he will <HI>come
<PB N="272" REF="045042_0269_101F7FECB29F7CE8">
in the glory of his Father, with the holy angels,</HI> Mark viii. 38. When he came in the fle&s;h, to die for &s;inners, he laid a&s;ide the robes of his glory, and was de&s;pi&s;ed and rejected of men: but when he comes again, to judge the world, &s;uch &s;hall be his vi&s;ible glory and maje&s;ty, that it &s;hall ca&s;t an eternal vail over all earthly glory, and fill his greate&s;t enemies with fear and dread. Never had prince, or poten|tate in the world, &s;uch a glorious train, as will accompany this Judge: all the holy angels &s;hall come with him, for his honour and &s;ervice. Then he, who was led to the cro&s;s with a band of &s;oldiers, will be gloriou&s;ly attended to the place of judgment, by <HI>(not a mul|titude of the heavenly ho&s;t,</HI> but) the whole ho&s;t of angels; <HI>all his holy angels,</HI> &s;ay the text.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> At the coming of the Judge, the <HI>&s;ummons</HI> are given to the parties, by the &s;ound of the la&s;t trumpet; at which the dead are rai&s;ed, and the&s;e found alive changed; of which before, 1 The&s;&s;. iv. 16, 17. O loud trumpet, that &s;hall be heard at once, in all cor|ners of the earth, and of the &s;ea? O wonderful voice, that will not only di&s;turb tho&s;e who &s;leep in the du&s;t; but effectually awaken, rouze them out of their &s;leep, and rai&s;e them from death! Were trumpets &s;ounding now, drums beating, furious &s;oldiers crying and killing men, women and children running and &s;hrieking, the wounded groaning and dying; tho&s;e who are in the graves, would have no more di&s;turbance, than if the world were in mo&s;t profound peace. Yea, were &s;tormy winds ca&s;ting down the lofty oaks, the the &s;eas roaring and &s;wallowing up the &s;hips, the mo&s;t dreadful thunders going along the heavens, lightnings every-where fla&s;hing, the earth quaking, trembling, opening, and &s;wallowing up whole cities, and burying multitudes at once; the dead would &s;till enjoy a perfect repo&s;e, and &s;leep &s;oundly in the du&s;t; though their own du&s;t &s;hould be thrown out of its place. But at the &s;ound of this trumpet they &s;hall all awake. The morning is come, they can &s;leep no longer; the time of the dead, that they mu&s;t be judged: they mu&s;t get out of their graves, and appear before the Judge.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> The Judge &s;hall &s;it down on the <HI>tribunal;</HI> he <HI>&s;hall &s;it on the throne of his glory.</HI> Sometime he &s;tood before a tribunal on earth, and was condemned as a malefactor: then &s;hall he &s;it on his own tribunal, and judge the world. Sometime he hung upon the cro&s;s, covered with &s;hame: then he &s;hall &s;it on a throne of glory. What this <HI>throne</HI> &s;hall be, whether a bright cloud, or what el&s;e, I &s;hall not inquire. Our eyes will give an an&s;wer to that que&s;tion at length. John <HI>&s;aw a great white throne,</HI> Rev. xx. 11. <HI>His throne</HI> (&s;ays <HI>Daniel) was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire,</HI> chap. vii. 9. Whatever it be, doubtle&s;s it &s;hall be a throne <HI>glorious</HI> beyond expre&s;&s;ion; and, in compari&s;on with which, the mo&s;t glori|ous throne on the earth is but a &s;eat on a dunghill; and the &s;ight of it will equally &s;urpri&s;e kings, who &s;it on thrones in this life, and beggars, who &s;at in dunghills. It will be a throne, for &s;tateline&s;s

and glory, &s;uited to the quality of him who &s;hall &s;it on it Never had a judge &s;uch a throne, and never had a throne &s;uch a judge on it.</P>
<P>Leaving the di&s;covery of the nature of the throne until <HI>that day,</HI> it concerns us more nearly to con&s;ider what a <HI>Judge</HI> will &s;it upon it; a point in which we are not left to uncertain conj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ctures. The Judge on the throne will be (1.) <HI>A vi&s;ible Judge,</HI> vi&s;ible to our bodily eyes, Rev. i. 7. <HI>Every eye &s;hall &s;ee him</HI> When God give the law on m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n at <HI>Sinai,</HI> the people <HI>&s;aw no &s;imilitude, only they heard a voice:</HI> but when he calls the world to an account, how they have ob&s;erved his law; the man Chri&s;t being Judge, we &s;hall &s;ee our Judge with our eyes, either to our eternal comfort or confu&s;ion; according to the entertainment we give him now. That very body which was crucified without the gates of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> betwixt two thieves, &s;hall then be &s;een on the throne, &s;hining in glory. We now &s;ee him &s;ymbolically in the &s;acrament of his &s;upper: the &s;aints &s;ee him by the eye of faith: then, all &s;hall &s;ee him with the&s;e eyes now in their heads. (2) <HI>A Judge having full authority and power,</HI> to render unto every one according to his works. Chri&s;t, as God, hath au|thority of him&s;elf; and as Mediator, he hath a judicial power and authority, which his Father has inve&s;ted him with, according to the covenant betwixt the Father and the Son, for the redemption of &s;inners. And his divine glory will be a light, by which all men &s;hall &s;ee clearly to read his commi&s;&s;ion for this great and honourable employment. <HI>All power is given unto him in heaven and in earth,</HI> Matth. xxviii 18. He hath <HI>the keys of hell and of death,</HI> Rev. i. 18. There can be no appeal from his tribunal: &s;entence once, pa&s;t there, mu&s;t &s;tand for ever; there is no rever&s;ing of it. All appeals are from an inferior court to a &s;uperior one; but when God gives &s;entence again&s;t a man, where can he find a higher court to bring his proce&s;s too? This judgment is the Mediator's judgment; and therefore the <HI>la&s;t</HI> judgment. If the Interce&s;&s;or be again&s;t us, who can be for us? If Chri&s;t condemn us, who will ab&s;olve us? (3.) <HI>A Judge of infinite wi&s;dom.</HI> His eyes will pierce <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and ci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y di&s;|cern, the mo&s;t intricate ca&s;es.

the poor; but ju&s;t judgment &s;hall go forth in every one's cau&s;e. <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> An <HI>omnipotent Judge,</HI> able to put his &s;entence in execution. The united force of devils and wicked men will be altogether un|able to with&s;tand him. They cannot retard the execution of the &s;entence again&s;t them, one moment; far le&s;s can they &s;top it alto|gether, <HI>Thou&s;and thou&s;ands</HI> (of angels) <HI>mini&s;ter unto him,</HI> Dan. vii. 10. And, by the breath of his mouth, he can drive the cur&s;ed herd whither he plea&s;eth.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> The parties &s;hall <HI>compear.</HI> The&s;e are <HI>men</HI> and <HI>devils.</HI> Although the&s;e la&s;t, the fallen angels, were, from the fir&s;t moment of their &s;inning, &s;ubjected to the wrath of God, and were <HI>ca&s;t down to hell;</HI> and where&s;oever they go, they carry their hell about with them: yet, it is evident, that they are <HI>re&s;erved unto judgment,</HI> (2 Pet. ii. 14.) namely, <HI>unto the judgment of the great day,</HI> Jude 6. And then they &s;hall be &s;olemnly and publickly judged, 1 Cor vi. 3. <HI>Know ye not that we &s;hall judge angels?</HI> At that day they &s;hall an&s;wer for their trade of &s;inning and tempting to &s;in, which they have been carrying on <HI>from the beginning.</HI> Then many a helli&s;h brat, which Satan has laid down at the &s;aints door, but not adopted by them, &s;hall be laid at the door of the true father of it, that is, the devil. And he &s;hall receive the due reward of all the di&s;honour he has done to God, and of all the mi&s;chief he has done to men. Tho&s;e wicked &s;pirits now <HI>in chains</HI> (though not in &s;uch &s;trait cu&s;tody, but that they go about like roaring lions, &s;eeking whom they may devour) &s;hall then receive their final &s;entence, and be &s;hut up in their den, namely, in the pri&s;on of hell; where they &s;hall be held in extreme and un&s;peakable torment through all eternity, Rev.xx. 10.
<Q>And the devil that decieved them, was ca&s;t into the lake of fire and brim&s;tone, where the bea&s;t and the fal&s;e prophet are, and &s;hall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.</Q>
In pro&s;pect of which, the devils &s;aid to Chri&s;t, <HI>Art thou come hither to torment us before the time?</HI> Matth. viii. 29.</P>
<P>But what we are chiefly concerned to take notice of, is the ca&s;e of <HI>men</HI> at that day. All men mu&s;t compear before this tribunal. All of each &s;ex, and of every age, quality and condition; the great and &s;mall, noble and ignoble; none are excepted. <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve,</HI> with all their &s;ons and daughters; every one who has had, or, to the end of the world, &s;hall have a living &s;oul united to a body; will make up this great congregation. Even tho&s;e, who refu&s;ed to come to the throne of grace, &s;hall be forced to the bar of <HI>ju&s;tice:</HI> for there can be no <HI>hiding</HI> from the all-&s;eeing Judge, no <HI>flying</HI> from him who is pre&s;ent every-where, no <HI>re&s;i&s;ting</HI> of him who is armed with almighty power. <HI>We mu&s;t all &s;tand before the judgment &s;eat of Chri&s;t,</HI> 2 Cor v. 10. <HI>Before him &s;hall be gathered all nations,</HI> &s;ays the text. This is to be done by the mini&s;try of angels. By them &s;hall the elect be gathered, Mark xiii. 27.
<Q>Then &s;hall he &s;end his angels, and &s;hall gather toge|ther his elect from the four winds.</Q>
And they al&s;o &s;hall gather the reprobate, Matth. xiii. 40, 41

From all corners of the world &s;hall the inhabitants thereof be gathered into the place where he &s;hall &s;et his throne for judgment.</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly,</HI> There &s;hall be a <HI>&s;eparation</HI> made betwixt the righteous and the wicked; the fair company of the elect &s;heep being &s;et on Chri&s;t's right hand, and the reprobate goats on his left. There is no nece&s;&s;ity to wait for this &s;eparation, till the trial be over; &s;ince the parties do ri&s;e out of their graves, with plain outward marks of di&s;tinc|tion, as was cleared before The &s;eparation &s;eems to be effected by that double gathering before mentioned; the one of the <HI>elect,</HI> Mark xiii. 27. the other of <HI>them that do iniquity,</HI> Matth. xiii. 41. The elect, being <HI>caught up together in the clouds, meet the Lord in the air,</HI> (1 The&s;&s; iv. 17.) and &s;o are &s;et on his right hand: and the reprobate <HI>left</HI> on the earth (Matth. xxv. 40) upon the Judge's left hand Here is now a total &s;eparation of two parties, who were always oppo&s;ite to each other, in their principles, aims, and manner of life; who, when together, were a burden the one to the other, under which the one groaned, and the other raged: but now they are freely parted, never to come together any more. The <HI>iron</HI> and <HI>clay (allude to Daniel</HI> ii. 41, 43.) which could never <HI>mix,</HI> are quite &s;eparated: the one being drawn up into the air, by the attractive virtue of <HI>the &s;tone cut out of the mountain,</HI> namely, Je&s;us Chri&s;t: the other left upon its earth, to be trod under foot.</P>
<P>Now let us look to the right hand, and there we will &s;ee a glorious company of &s;aints, &s;hining as &s;o many &s;tars in their orbs: and with a chearful countenance beholding him, who &s;itteth upon the throne. Here will be two wonderful &s;ights, which the world u&s;ed not to &s;ee. (1.) <HI>A great congregation of &s;aints, in which not &s;o much as one hypocrite,</HI> There was a bloody <HI>Cain</HI> in <HI>Adam</HI>'s family, a cur&s;ed <HI>Ham</HI> in <HI>Noah</HI>'s family, in the ark; a treacherous <HI>Judas,</HI> in Chri&s;t's own family: but in that company &s;hall be none but &s;ealed ones, members of Chri&s;t, having all one Father. And this is a &s;ight re&s;erved for that day. (2.) <HI>All the godly upon one &s;ide.</HI> Seldom or never do the &s;aints on earth make &s;uch a harmony, but there are &s;ome jarring &s;trings among them. It is not to be expected, that men who &s;ee but in part, though they be all going to one city, will agree as to every &s;tep in the way: no, we need not look for it in this &s;tate of imperfection. But at that day, <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> &s;hall meet in peace and unity, though once <HI>the contention was &s;o &s;harp between them, that they departed a&s;under, the one from the other.</HI> Acts xv. 39. There &s;hall be no more divi&s;ions, no more &s;epa|rate &s;tanding, among&s;t tho&s;e who belong to Chri&s;t. All the godly of the different parties &s;hall then be upon one &s;ide; &s;eeing, whatever were their differences in le&s;&s;er things, while in the world, yet, even then, they met and concentred all in <HI>one Lord</HI> Je&s;us Chri&s;t, by a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and lively <HI>faith,</HI> and in the one way of <HI>holine&s;s or</HI> practical godline&s;s.

Then will many actions, commended and applauded of men, as good and ju&s;t, be di&s;covered to have been evil and abominable, in the &s;ight of God: and many works, now condemned by the world, will be approven and commended by the great Judge, as good and ju&s;t. Secret things will be brought to light: and what was hid from the view of the world, &s;hall be laid open. Wickedne&s;s, which hath kept its lurking-place in &s;pite of all human &s;earch, will then be brought forth to the glory of God, and the confu&s;ion of impenitent &s;inners who hid it. The world appears now very vile, in the eyes of tho&s;e who are exerci&s;ed to godline&s;s: but it will then appear a thou&s;and times more vile, when that, which is <HI>done</HI> of men <HI>in &s;ecret,</HI> comes to be di&s;covered. Every good action &s;hall then be remembred; and the hidden religion and good works, mo&s;t indu&s;triou&s;ly concealed by the &s;aints, from the eyes of men, &s;hall no more ly hid: for though the Lord will not allow men to <HI>proclaim every man his own goodne&s;s;</HI> yet he him&s;elf will do it in due time. <HI>Secondly,</HI> Their <HI>words</HI> &s;hall be judged, Matth. xii. 37.
<Q>For by thy words thou &s;halt be ju&s;tified, and by thy words thou &s;halt be con|demned.</Q>
Not a word &s;poken for God, and his cau&s;e in the world, from love to him&s;elf, &s;hall be forgotten. They are all kept in re|membrance, and &s;hall be brought forth as evidences of faith, and of an intere&s;t in Chri&s;t, Mal. iii. 16.
<Q>Then they that feared the Lord, &s;pake often one to another, and the Lord hearkned and heard it: and a book of remembrance was written before him. Ver. 17. And they &s;hall be mine, &s;aith the Lord of ho&s;ts, in that day when I make up my jewels.</Q>
And the tongue, which did run at random, &s;hall then confe&s;s to God: and the &s;peaker &s;hall find it to have been followed, and every word noted that dropped from his un&s;ancti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ied lips.
<Q>Every idle word that men &s;hall &s;peak, they &s;hall give account thereof in the day of judgment,</Q>
Matth. xii. 36. And if they &s;hall give account of <HI>idle words,</HI> that is, words &s;poken to no good purpo&s;e, neither to God's glory, one's own, or one's neighbour's good: how much more &s;hall men's <HI>wicked words,</HI> their &s;inful oaths, cur&s;es, lies, filthy communications, and bitter words be called over again, that day? The <HI>tongues</HI> of many &s;hall then <HI>fall upon them&s;elves,</HI> and ruin them. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> Men's <HI>thoughts</HI> &s;hall be brought into judgment: the Judge "will make manife&s;t the coun&s;el of the hearts," 1 Cor. iv. 5. Thoughts go free from man's judgment, but not from the judgment of the heart-&s;earching God, who knows men's thoughts, without the help of &s;igns to di&s;cern them by. The &s;ecret &s;prings of men's actions will then be brought to light; and the &s;ins, that never came further than the heart, will then be laid open. O what a figure will man's corrupt nature make, when his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> is turned out, and all his &s;peculative
<PB N="278" REF="045042_0275_101F800158D92138">
impurities are expo&s;ed! the rottenne&s;s that is within many a whited &s;epulchre, the &s;peculative filthine&s;s and wantonne&s;s, murder and ma|lignity, now lurking in the hearts of men, as in <HI>the chamber of imagery,</HI> will then be di&s;covered; and what good was in the hearts of any, &s;hall no more lie concealed. If it was in their hearts <HI>to build a hou&s;e to the Lord,</HI> they &s;hall hear, that <HI>they did well that it was in their heart.</HI></P>
<P>This trial will be righteous and impartial, accurate and &s;earching, clear and evident. The Judge is <HI>the righteous Judge,</HI> and he will do <HI>right</HI> to every one. He has a ju&s;t balance for good and evil actions, and for hone&s;t and fal&s;e hearts. The fig-leave cover of hypocri&s;y will then be <HI>blown</HI> a&s;ide, and the hypocrite's nakedne&s;s will appear; as when the Lord came to judge <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve, in the cool</HI> (or, as the word is, <HI>in the wind</HI>) <HI>of the day,</HI> Gen. iii.8. <HI>The fire</HI> (which tries things mo&s;t exqui&s;itely) <HI>&s;hall try every man's work, of what &s;ort it is,</HI> 1 Cor. iii 13. Man's judgment is oft-times perplexed and confu&s;ed; but here the whole proce&s;s &s;hall be clear and evident, as written with a &s;un-beam. It &s;hall be clear to the <HI>Judge,</HI> to whom no ca&s;e can be intricate; to the <HI>parties,</HI> who &s;hall be <HI>convinced,</HI> Jude 15. And the multitudes on both &s;ides, &s;hall &s;ee the judge is clear when he judgeth: for then <HI>the heavens &s;hall declare his righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> in the audience of all the world; and &s;o it &s;hall be univer&s;ally known, P&s;al. l. 6.</P>
<P>On the&s;e accounts it is, that this <HI>trial</HI> is held out in the &s;cripture under the notion of <HI>opening of books;</HI> and men are &s;aid to be <HI>judged out of tho&s;e things written in the books,</HI> Rev. xx 12. The Judge of the world, who infallibly knoweth all things, hath no need of <HI>books</HI> to be laid before him, to prevent mi&s;take in any point of law or fact: but the expre&s;&s;ion points at his proceeding, as mo&s;t nice, accu|rate, ju&s;t, and well grounded, in every &s;tep of it. Now, there are four <HI>books</HI> that &s;hall be opened in that day.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The book of God's <HI>remembrance</HI> or omni&s;cience, Mal. iii. 19. This is an exact record of every man's &s;tate, thoughts, words, and deeds, good or evil: it is, as it were, a day-book, in which the Lord puts down all that pa&s;&s;eth in mens hearts, lips, and lives, and it is a-filling up every day that one lives. In it are recorded mens &s;ins and good works, &s;ecret and open, with all their circum&s;tances. Here are regi&s;tred all their privileges, mercies temporal and &s;pi|ritual, &s;ome-time laid to their hand; the checks, admonitions, and rebukes, given by teachers, neighbours, afflictions, and mens own con&s;ciences; every thing in its due order. This book will &s;erve only as a libel in re&s;pect of the ungodly; but it will be for another u&s;e in re&s;pect of godly, namely, for a <HI>memorial</HI> of their good. The opening of it is the Judge's bringing to light what is written in it; the reading as it were, of the libel and memorial, re&s;pectively, in their hearing.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The book of <HI>con&s;cience</HI> will be opened, and &s;hall be at a thou&s;and witne&s;&s;es to prove the fact, Rom. ii. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. <HI>Which &s;hew the
<PB N="279" REF="045042_0276_101F800549E23A48">
work of the law written in their hearts, their con&s;cience al&s;o bearing witne&s;s.</HI> Con&s;cience is a cen&s;or going with every man whither&s;o|ever he goes, taking an account of his deeds done in the body, and, as it were noting them in a book; the which being opened, will be found a double of the former, &s;o far as it relates to one's own &s;tate and ca&s;e Much is written in it, which cannot be read now; the writing of con&s;cience being in many ca&s;es, like to that which is made with the juice of lemons, not to be read, till it be held be|fore the fire: but <HI>then</HI> men &s;hall read it clearly and di&s;tinctly: the fire which is to try every man's work, will m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ke the book of con|&s;cience legible in every point. Tho' the book be &s;ealed now (the con&s;cience blind, dumb and deaf) the &s;eals will then be broken, and the book opened. There &s;hall be no more a weak or mi&s;informed con&s;cience among tho&s;e on the right hand, or the&s;e on the left. There &s;hall not be a <HI>&s;ilent</HI> con&s;cience, and far le&s;s a <HI>&s;cared</HI> con&s;ci|ence among&s;t all the ungodly crew: but their con&s;ciences &s;hall be mo&s;t quick-&s;ighted, and mo&s;t lively, in that day. None &s;hall then call good evil, or evil good. Ignorance of what <HI>&s;in</HI> is, and what things are <HI>&s;ins,</HI> will have no place among them: and the &s;ubtle rea&s;onings of men, in favour of their lu&s;ts, will then be for ever baffled by their own con&s;ciences. None &s;hall have the favour (if I may &s;o &s;peak) of lying under the &s;oft cover of delu&s;ion: but they &s;hall all be <HI>convicted by their con&s;cience.</HI> Nill they, will they, they &s;hall look on this book, read and be confounded, and <HI>&s;tand &s;peech|le&s;s,</HI> knowing that nothing is charged upon them by mi&s;take; &s;ince this is a book, which was always in their own cu&s;tody. Thus &s;hall the Judge make every man &s;ee him&s;elf, in the gla&s;s of his own <HI>con|&s;cience,</HI> which will make quick work.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The book of <HI>the Law</HI> &s;hall be opened. This book is the &s;tandard and rule, by which is known what i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> right, and what is wrong; as al&s;o, what &s;entence is to be pa&s;&s;ed accordinly, on the&s;e who are under it. As to the opening of this book, in its <HI>&s;tatutory</HI> part, which &s;hews what is &s;in, and what is duty; it falls in with the opening of the book of con&s;cience. For con&s;cience is &s;et, by the Sovereign Lawgiver, in every man's brea&s;t, to be his private teacher, to &s;hew him the law, and his private pa&s;tor, to make ap|plication of the &s;ame; and, at that day, it will be perfectly fit for its office; &s;o that the con&s;cience, which is mo&s;t &s;tupid now, &s;hall then read to the man, mo&s;t accurate, but dreadful lectures, on the law. But what &s;eems (mainly at lea&s;t) pointed at, by the opening of this book, is the opening of that part of it, which determines the reward of mens works. Now, the law promi&s;eth life, upon perfect obedience: but none can be found on the right hand, or on the left, who will pretend to that, when once the book of con&s;ci|ence is opened, it threatneth death upon di&s;obedience, and will ef|fectually bring it upon all under its dominion. And this part of the book of the law, determining the reward of mens works, is
<PB N="280" REF="045042_0277_101F800B14940548">
opened, only to &s;hew what mu&s;t be the portion of the ungodly, and that there they may read their &s;entence before it be pronounced. But it is not opened for the &s;entence of the &s;aints; for no &s;entence ab|&s;olving a &s;inner could ever be drawn out of it. The law promi&s;eth life, not as it is a rule of actions, but as a covenant of works: And therefore innocent man could not have demanded life upon his obedience, till the law was reduced into the form of a cove|nant; as was &s;hewn before. But the &s;aints having been, in this life, brought under a new covenant, namely, the covenant of grace, were <HI>dead to the law,</HI> as a covenant of works, and it was dead to them. Wherefore, as they &s;hall not have any fears of death from it, &s;o they can have no hopes of life from it, &s;ince <HI>they are not un|der the law, but under grace,</HI> Rom. vi. 14 But, for their &s;entence, <HI>another book is opened;</HI> of which in the next place.</P>
<P>Thus the book of the law is opened, for the &s;entence again&s;t all tho&s;e on the left hand: and by it they will clearly &s;ee the ju&s;tice of the judgment again&s;t them, and how the Judge proceeds there|in according to <HI>law.</HI> Neverthele&s;s, there will be this difference, namely, that the&s;e who had only the <HI>natural law,</HI> and lived not under any &s;pecial revelation, &s;hall be judged by that law of nature they had in their hearts: which law bears, <HI>that they who commit &s;uch things</HI> (as they will &s;tand convicted of) <HI>are worthy of death,</HI> Rom. i. 32. But the&s;e, who had the <HI>written law,</HI> to whom the word of God came, as it has &s;ounded in the vi&s;ible church, &s;hall be judged by that written law. So &s;ays the Apo&s;tle, Rom. ii. 12. <HI>For as many as have &s;inned without</HI> (the written) <HI>law, &s;hall peri&s;h without</HI> (the written) <HI>law: and as many as have &s;inned in the law (i e.</HI> under the written law) <HI>&s;hall be judged by the</HI> (written) <HI>law.</HI></P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly, Another book</HI> &s;hall be <HI>opened, which is the book of life,</HI> Rev. xx. 12. In this, the names of all the elect are written, as Chri&s;t &s;aid to his di&s;ciples, Luke x. 20 <HI>Your names are written in heaven.</HI> This book contains God's gracious and unchangeable purpo&s;e, to bring all the elect to eteral life; and that, in order thereto, they be redeemed by the blood of his Son, effectually called, ju&s;tified, adopted, &s;anctified, and rai&s;ed up by him at the la&s;t day without &s;in. It is now lodged in the Mediator's hand, as the book of <HI>the manner of the kingdom;</HI> and having perfected the work the Father gave them to do; he &s;hall, on the great day produce, and open the book, and <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> the per&s;ons therein named, <HI>faultle&s;s before the pre&s;ence of his glory,</HI> Jude 24. <HI>Not having &s;pot or wrinkle, or any &s;uch thing,</HI> Eph. v. 27. None of them all, who are named in the book, &s;hall be mi&s;&s;ing. They &s;hall be found qualified, according to the order of the book, redeemed, called, ju&s;tified, &s;anctified, rai&s;ed up without &s;pot: what remains then, but that, according to the &s;ame book, they obtain the great end, namely, everla&s;ting life. This may be gathered from that precious promi&s;e, Rev. iii. 5.
<Q>He that overcometh, the &s;ame &s;hall be clothed in white raiment,
<PB N="281" REF="045042_0278_101F800CBB04BFD8">
(being rai&s;ed in glory) and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life. But I will confe&s;s his name (it &s;hall be, as it were, read out among the re&s;t of God's elect) before my Father, and before his angels.</Q>
Here is now the ground of the &s;aints' ab&s;ol|viture, the ground of the ble&s;&s;ed &s;entence they &s;hall receive The book of life being opened, it will be known to all, who are elected, and who are not. Thus far of the <HI>trial</HI> of the parties.</P>
<P><HI>Eightly,</HI> Then &s;hall the Judge pronounce that ble&s;&s;ed <HI>&s;entence</HI> on the &s;aints,
<Q>Come ye ble&s;&s;ed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world,</Q>
Matth xxv 34. It is mo&s;t probable, the Man CHRIST will pronounce it with an audi|ble voice; which not only all the &s;aints, but all the wicked likewi&s;e, &s;hall hear and under&s;tand. Who can conceive the inexpre&s;&s;ible joy, with which the&s;e happy ones &s;hall hear the&s;e words? Who can ima|gine that fulne&s;s of joy, which &s;hall be poured into their hearts, with the&s;e words reaching their ears? And who can conceive how much of hell &s;hall break into the hearts of all the ungodly crew, by the&s;e words of heaven? It is certain this &s;entence &s;hall be pronounced before the &s;entence of damnation, Matth. xxv. 34.
<Q>Then &s;hall the King &s;ay unto them on his right hand, Come ye ble&s;&s;ed&punc; &amp;c. Ver 41. Then &s;hall he &s;ay al&s;o to them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cur&s;ed, &amp;c.</Q>
There is no need of this order, that the &s;aints may, without fear or a&s;toni&s;hment, hear the other &s;entence on the reprobate: they who are rai&s;ed in glory, caught up to meet the Lord in the air, pre&s;ented without &s;pot, and who&s;e &s;ouls (for the far greater part of them) have been &s;o long in heaven before, &s;hall not be capable of any &s;uch <HI>fear.</HI> But hereby they will be orderly brought in, to &s;it in judgment, as Chri&s;t's <HI>a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors,</HI> again&s;t the ungodly: who&s;e torment will be aggravated by it. It will be a hell to them, to be kept out of hell, till they &s;ee the doors of heaven opened to receive the &s;aints, who once dwelt in the &s;ame world with them; and perhaps in the &s;ame country, pari&s;h, or town, and &s;at under the &s;ame mini&s;try with them&s;elves. Thus will they &s;ee heaven afar off, to make their hell the hotter. Like that unbelieving lord, 2 Kings vii. 19, 20. They "&s;hall &s;ee the plenty with their eyes&punc; but &s;hall not eat thereof." Every word of the ble&s;&s;ed &s;entence &s;hall be like an envenomed arrow &s;hot into their hearts, while they &s;ee what they have lo&s;t, and from thence gather what they are to expect</P>
<P>This &s;entence pa&s;&s;eth on the &s;aints <HI>according to their works,</HI> Rev xx 12 But not <HI>for</HI> their <HI>works,</HI> nor <HI>f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r</HI> their <HI>faith</HI> neither, as if eternal life were merited by them The &s;entence it&s;elf overthrows this ab&s;urd conceit. The kingdom they are called to, was "prepared for them, from the foundation of the world;" not left to be merited by them&s;elves, who were but <HI>of ye&s;terday.</HI> They <HI>inherit</HI> it as <HI>&s;ons,</HI> but procure it not to them&s;elves, as <HI>&s;ervants</HI> do the reward of their work. They were redeemed by the blood of Chri&s;t, and clothed with his &s;potle&s;s righteou&s;ne&s;s, which is the proper cau&s;e of the &s;entence.
<PB N="282" REF="045042_0279_101F800FB2B78158">
They were al&s;o qualified for heaven, by the &s;anctification of his Spirit; and hence it is <HI>according to their works;</HI> &s;o that the ungodly world &s;hall &s;ee now, that the Judge of the quick and dead does <HI>good</HI> to them who were <HI>good.</HI> Therefore it is added to the &s;entence,
<Q>For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat, &amp;c.</Q>
Ver. 35, 36. which doth not denote the <HI>ground,</HI> but the <HI>evidence</HI> of their right to heaven; as if a judge &s;hould &s;ay, he ab&s;olves a man pur&s;ued for debt; <HI>for the witne&s;&s;es depone. that it is paid already.</HI> So the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, 1 Cor x. 5. "But with many of them God was not well plea&s;ed, for they were overthrown in the wilderne&s;s." Their overthrow in the wilderne&s;s was not the ground of God's di&s;plea&s;ure with them, but it was an evidence of it. And thus our Lord teacheth us the nece&s;&s;ary <HI>connexion</HI> betwixt <HI>glory</HI> and <HI>good works,</HI> namely, works <HI>evangelically</HI> good; works having a re&s;pect to <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> and done out of <HI>faith</HI> in him, and <HI>love</HI> to him, without which they will not be regarded in that day And the &s;aints will &s;o far be judged <HI>according</HI> to <HI>&s;uch</HI> works, that the degrees of glory among&s;t them &s;hall be accord|ing to the&s;e works: for it is an eternal truth,

<P>Thus &s;hall the <HI>good works</HI> of the godly have a glorious, not a gratuitous reward; a reward of grace, not of debt, which will fill them with wonder at the riches of free grace, and the Lord's con|de&s;cending to take any notice, e&s;pecially &s;uch public notice, of their poor worthle&s;s works.

Ver. 45. O meat and drink unhappily &s;pared, when a member of Chri&s;t was in need of it!

Men will be condemned for not cloathing them, when naked: then, how heavy mu&s;t the &s;entence of tho&s;e be, who have &s;tript them, and made them go without cloathing?

Further, it is re|markable, in the execution of the &s;entence Rev. xx. 14, 15. that not only the reprobate are <HI>ca&s;t into the lake,</HI> but <HI>death and hell</HI> are ca&s;t into it likewi&s;e: all effects of &s;in, and of the cur&s;e, are removed out of the world, (for which very cau&s;e &s;hall the conflagration be) and they are confined to the place of the damned Be&s;ides all this, it is evident the end of the world is by the conflagration: and the Apo&s;tle tells us, (1 Cor. xv. 24, 25.) that
<Q>Then cometh the end, when he &s;hall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father: when he &s;hall have put down all rule, and all authority, and power. For he mu&s;t reign, till he hath put all enemies un|der his feet.</Q>
The which la&s;t, as it mu&s;t be done before the end: &s;o it &s;eems not to be done, but by putting the &s;entence in execu|tion, pa&s;t in the day of judgment, again&s;t the wicked.</P>
<P>Now if the burning of <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gommorrah,</HI> that are <HI>&s;et forth for an example,</HI> (Jude 7.) was &s;o dreadful: how terrible will that day, be, when the whole world &s;hall be at once in flames! how will wretched worldlings look, when their darling world &s;hall be all on fire? Then &s;hall &s;trong ca&s;tles, and towering palaces, with all their rich furniture, go up together in one flame with the lowe&s;t cottages.

<Q>It is not for you to know the times or the &s;ea|&s;ons, which the Father has put in his own power.</Q>

Neverthele&s;s, &s;ome in &s;everal ages, have made very bold with the time; and &s;everal particular years, which are now pa&s;t, have been given out to the world, for the time of the end, by men who have pried into the &s;ecrets of God.

Let us re&s;t in that <HI>he cometh.</HI> God hath kept the day hid from us, that we may be every day <HI>ready</HI> for it, Matth. xxv. 13.
<Q>Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour, wherein the Son of man cometh.</Q>
And let us remember, that the la&s;t day of our life will determine our &s;tate in the la&s;t day of the world: and as we die &s;o &s;hall we be judged.</P>

Though the world <HI>reproach,</HI> judge and condemn you; the Judge will, at that day, ab&s;olve you, and <HI>bring forth your righteou&s;ne&s;s as the light.</HI> The world's fools will then appear to have been the only wi&s;e men who were in it. Though the <HI>cro&s;s</HI> be heavy, you may well bear it in expectation of the crown of righteou&s;ne&s;s, which the righteous Judge will then give you.

This may &s;erve to awaken a &s;ecure generation, a world lying in wickedne&s;s, as if they were never to be called to an account for it; and &s;lighting the Mediator, as if he were not to judge them.

But O! con&s;ider the day that is approaching, in which Chri&s;t &s;hall come to judgment; the world &s;hall be &s;ummoned, by the &s;ound of the la&s;t trumpet, to compear before his tribunal.

<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> Be <HI>exhorted</HI> to believe this great truth; and believe it &s;o as you may prepare for the judgment betimes.

Make the Judge your friend in time, by clo&s;ing with him in the offer of the go&s;pel; and give all diligence, that ye may be found in Chri&s;t, at that day Ca&s;t off the works of darkne&s;s, and live, as believing you are, at all times, and in all places, under the eye of your Judge, who will <HI>bring every work into judgment, with every &s;ecret thing.</HI> Be fruitful in good works, knowing that as ye &s;ow, ye &s;hall reap. Study piety towards God, righteou&s;ne&s;s and charity towards men. Lay up in &s;tore plenty of works of charity and mercy, towards them who are in di&s;tre&s;s, e&s;pecially &s;uch as are <HI>of the hou&s;hold of faith,</HI> that they may be produced that day as evidences, that ye belong to Chri&s;t. Shut not up your bowels of mercy, now, towards the needy; le&s;t ye, then, find no mercy. Take heed, that in all your works, ye be &s;ingle and &s;incere; aim|ing, in them all, at the glory of your Lord, a te&s;timony of your love to him, and obedience to his command. Leave it to hypocrites, who <HI>have their reward,</HI> to proclaim every man his own goodne&s;s, and <HI>to &s;ound a trumpet,</HI> when they do their alms. It is a ba&s;e and unchri&s;tian &s;pirit, which cannot have &s;atisfaction in a good work, unle&s;s it be expo&s;ed to the view of others: it is utterly unworthy of one, who believes that the la&s;t trumpet &s;hall call together the whole world; before whom the Judge him&s;elf &s;hall publi&s;h works truly good, how &s;ecretly &s;oever they were done. Live in a believ|ing expectation of the coming of the Lord.

<P>The Lord is plea&s;ed often to repre&s;ent unto us the glorious &s;tate of the &s;aints, under the notion of their being clothed in <HI>white garment&s;.</HI> It is promi&s;ed to the overcomer, that he &s;hall be <HI>clothed in white raiment,</HI> Rev. iii. 5. The elders about the throne are <HI>clothed in white raiment,</HI> chap. iv. 4. The multitude before the throne are <HI>clothed with white robes,</HI> chap. vii. 9 <HI>arrayed in white robes,</HI> ver. 13. <HI>made white in the blood of the Lamb,</HI> ver. 14. I own the la&s;t two te&s;timonies adduced, do re&s;pect the &s;tate of the &s;aints on earth: but withal the terms are borrowed from the &s;tate of the church in heaven. All garments, properly &s;o called, being badges of &s;in and &s;hame, &s;hall be laid a&s;ide by the &s;aints, when they come to their &s;tate of glory. But if we con&s;ider on what occa&s;ions white garments were wont to be put on, we &s;hall find much of heaven under them.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The <HI>Romans</HI> when they manumitted their bond-&s;ervants, gave them a white garment, as a badge of their freedom. So &s;hall the &s;aints that day get on their <HI>white</HI> robes; for it is the day of <HI>the glorious li|berty of the children of God,</HI> (Rom. viii. 21.) the day of <HI>the redempti|on of their body,</HI> ver. 23. They &s;hall no more &s;ee the hou&s;e of bondage, nor ly any more among the pots. If we compare the &s;tate of the &s;aints on earth with that of the wicked, it is indeed a &s;tate of <HI>freedom;</HI> wheras the other is a &s;tate of &s;lavery: but in compari&s;on with their &s;tate in heaven, it is but a <HI>&s;ervitude.</HI> A &s;aint on earth is indeed a young prince, and heir to the crown; but his motto may be, <HI>I &s;erve,</HI> for "<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he differeth nothing from a &s;ervant, though he be lord of all," Gal. iv. 1. What are the groans of a &s;aint, the &s;ordid and ba&s;e work he is &s;ometimes found employed in, the black and tattered garments he walks in, but badges of this <HI>comparative &s;ervitude?</HI> But from the day the &s;aints come to the crown, they receive their compleat freedom, and &s;erve no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ore. They &s;hall be fully freed from <HI>&s;in,</HI> which of all evils is the wor&s;t, both in it&s;elf, and in their apprehen&s;ion too: how great then mu&s;t that freedom be, when the&s;e <HI>Egyptians whom they &s;ee to|day,</HI> they <HI>&s;hall &s;ee them again no more for ever?</HI> They &s;hall be free from all <HI>temptation</HI> to &s;in: Satan can have no acce&s;s to temptation, any more, by him&s;elf, nor by his agents. A full an&s;wer will then be given to that petition, they have &s;o often repeated, <HI>Lead us not into temptation.</HI> No hi&s;&s;ing &s;erpent can come into the paradi&s;e above: no &s;nare nor trap can be laid there, to catch the feet of the &s;aints: they may walk there fearle&s;ly, for they can be in no hazard: there are no <HI>lions dens,</HI> no <HI>mountains of the leopards,</HI> in the promi&s;ed land. Nay, they &s;hall be &s;et beyond the <HI>po&s;&s;ibility of &s;inning,</HI> for they &s;hall be con|firmed in goodne&s;s. It will be the con&s;umminate freedom of their will, to be for ever unalterably determined to good. And they &s;hall be freed from all the <HI>effects</HI> of &s;in;

xxx. 4: What kingdom is like unto this? Death makes its way now into a palace, as ea&s;ily as into a cottage: <HI>&s;orrow</HI> fills the heart of one who wears a crown on his <HI>head,</HI> royal robes are no fence again&s;t <HI>pain,</HI> and <HI>crying</HI> by rea&s;on of pain. But in this kingdom no mi&s;ery can have place. All reproaches &s;hall be wiped off; and never &s;hall a <HI>tear</HI> drop any more from their eyes They &s;hall not complain of <HI>de&s;ertions</HI> again; the Lord will never hide his face from them: but the Sun of righte|ou&s;ne&s;s &s;hining upon them in his meridian-brightne&s;s, will di&s;pel all clouds, and give them an everla&s;ting day, without the lea&s;t mixture of darkne&s;s. A deluge of wrath, after a fearful thunder-clap from the throne, will &s;weep away the wicked from before the judgment-&s;eat, into the lake of fire: but they are, in the fir&s;t place, like <HI>Noah</HI> brought into the ark, and out of harm's way.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> White raiment hath been a token of <HI>purity,</HI> Therefore <HI>the Lamb's wi&s;e</HI> is <HI>arrayed in fine linen, clean and white,</HI> Rev xix. 8. And tho&s;e who &s;tood before the throne <HI>wa&s;hed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb,</HI> chap. vii. 14. The &s;aints &s;hall then put on the robes of <HI>perfect purity,</HI> and &s;hine in &s;potle&s;s holine&s;s, like the &s;un in his &s;trength, without the lea&s;t cloud to intercept his light. Ab&s;olute innocence &s;hall then be re&s;tored, and every appear|ance of &s;in bani&s;hed far from his kingdom The <HI>guilt</HI> of &s;in, and <HI>reign|ing</HI> power of it, are now taken away in the &s;aints; neverthele&s;s &s;in dwelleth in them, Rom. vii. 20. But then it &s;hall be no more in them: the corrupt nature will be quite removed, that root of bitterne&s;s will be plucked up, and no ve&s;tiges of it left in their &s;ouls: their <HI>nature</HI> &s;hall be altogether pure and &s;inle&s;s. There &s;hall be no darkne&s;s in their minds; but the <HI>under&s;tanding</HI> of every &s;aint, when he is come to his kingdom, will be as a globe of pure and unmixed light. There &s;hall not be the lea&s;t aver&s;ion to good, or inclination to evil, in their <HI>wills:</HI> but they will be brought to a perfect conformity to the will of God; ble&s;t with angelical purity, and &s;ixed therein Their <HI>affections</HI> &s;hall not be liable to the lea&s;t di&s;order or irregularity: it will co&s;t them no trouble to keep them right: they will get &s;uch a &s;et of purity, as they can never lo&s;e. They will be &s;o refined from all earthly dro&s;s, as never to &s;avour more of any thing but heaven. Were it po&s;&s;ible they &s;hould be &s;et again amid&s;t the en&s;naring objects of an evil world, they &s;hould walk among them without the lea&s;t defilement; as the &s;un &s;hines on the dunghill, yet untainted, and as the angels pre&s;erved their purity in the mid&s;t of <HI>Sodom.</HI> Their <HI>graces</HI> &s;hall then be perfected; and all the imperfections now cleaving to them, done away. There will be no more ground of complaints of weakne&s;s of grace: none in that kingdom &s;hall complain of an ill heart, or a corrupt nature. <HI>It doth not y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t appear what we &s;hall be, but&mdash;when he &s;hall appear, we &s;hall be like him.</HI> 1 John iii. 2.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Among the Jews, the&s;e who de&s;ired to be admitted into the prie&s;tly office, being tried, and found to be of the prie&s;t's line, and without blemi&s;h, were clothed in <HI>white,</HI> and enrolled among the
<PB N="297" REF="045042_0294_101F8043D9F75AA8">
prie&s;ts. This &s;eems to be alluded to, Rev. iii. 5.
<Q>He that over|cometh&mdash;the &s;aints &s;hall be clothed in white raiment, and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life.</Q>
So the &s;aints &s;hall not be kings only, but prie&s;ts withal; for they are <HI>a Royal Prie&s;thood,</HI> 1 Pet. ii. 9. They will be <HI>prie&s;ts</HI> upon their thrones. They are judi|cially found de&s;cended from the great High-Prie&s;t of their profe&s;&s;ion, begotten of him by his Spirit, of the incorruptible &s;eed of the word, and without blemi&s;h: &s;o the trial being over, they are admitted to be <HI>prie&s;ts</HI> in the <HI>temple</HI> above, that they may dwell in the hou&s;e of the Lord for ever. There is nothing upon earth more glorious than a <HI>kingdom,</HI> nothing more venerable than the <HI>prie&s;thood:</HI> and both meet together in the glorified &s;tate of the &s;aints. <HI>The general a&s;&s;embly of the fir&s;t-born,</HI> (Heb. xii. 23.) who&s;e is the <HI>prie&s;thood</HI> the <HI>double portion,</HI> appearing in their <HI>white robes</HI> of glory, will be a reverend and glori|ous company. That day will &s;hew them to be the per&s;ons, whom the Lord has cho&s;en out of all the tribes of the earth, to be near unto him, and to enter into his temple, even into his holy place. Their <HI>prie&s;thood,</HI> begun on earth, &s;hall be brought to its perfection, while they &s;hall be employed in offering the &s;acrifice of prai&s;e to God and the Lamb, for ever and ever. They got not their portion, in the earth, with the re&s;t of the tribes: but the Lord him&s;elf was their portion, and will be their double portion, through the ages of eternity.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> They were wont to wear white raiment, in a time of <HI>triumph;</HI> to the which al&s;o there &s;eems to be an allu&s;ion, Rev. iii. 5. "He that overcometh, the &s;ame &s;hall be clothed in white raiment." And what is heaven but an everla&s;ting triumph! None get thither, but &s;uch as fight, and overcome too. Though <HI>Canaan</HI> was given to the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> an <HI>inheritance:</HI> they behoved to conquer it, ere they could be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of it. The &s;aints, in this world, are in the field of battle; often in <HI>red garments,</HI> garments rolled in blood: but the day approacheth, in which they &s;hall <HI>&s;tand before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands,</HI> (Rev. vii. 9.) having obtained a compleat victory over all their enemies. The <HI>palm</HI> was u&s;ed as a &s;ign of victory; becau&s;e that tree, oppre&s;&s;ed with weights, yieldeth not, but rather &s;hooteth upwards. And palm-trees were carved on the doors of the mo&s;t holy place, (1 Kings vi. 32.) which was a &s;pecial type of heaven; for heaven is the place, which the &s;aints are received into, as <HI>conquerors.</HI></P>
<P>Behold the <HI>joy</HI> and <HI>peace</HI> of the &s;aints in their white robes. The joys ari&s;ing from the view of pa&s;t dangers, and of riches and honours gained at the very door of death, do mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly touch one's heart: and this will be an ingredient in the everla&s;ting happine&s;s of the &s;aints, which could have had no place, in the heaven of innocent <HI>Adam,</HI> and his &s;inle&s;s offspring, &s;uppo&s;ing him to have &s;tood Surely the glorified &s;aints will not forget the entertainment they met with in the world: it will be for the glory of God to remember it, and al&s;o for the height|ening of their joy. The <HI>Sicilian</HI> king, by birth the &s;on of a <HI>potter,</HI>
<PB N="298" REF="045042_0295_101F80470A94B998">
acted a wi&s;e part, in that he would be &s;erved at his table, with <HI>earthen</HI> ve&s;&s;els: the which could not but put an additional &s;weetne&s;s in his meals, not to be reli&s;hed by one born heir to the crown. Can ever meat be &s;o &s;weet to any, as to the hungry man! Or can any have &s;uch a reli&s;h of plenty, as he who has been under pinching &s;traits: The more difficulties the &s;aints have pa&s;&s;ed through, in their way to heaven, the place will be the &s;weeter to them, when they come at it. Every happy &s;troke, &s;truck in the &s;piritual warfare, will be a jewel in their crown of glory. Each victory obtained again&s;t &s;in, Satan and the world, will rai&s;e their triumphant joy the higher. The remem|brance of the cro&s;s will &s;weeten the crown: and the memory of their travel through the wilderne&s;s, will put an additional verdure on the fields of glory; while they walk through them, minding the day, when they went <HI>mourning without the &s;un.</HI></P>
<P>And now that they appear <HI>triumphing</HI> in <HI>white robes,</HI> it is a &s;ign they have obtained an honourable <HI>place;</HI> &s;uch a peace as their enemies can di&s;turb no more. So every thing peculiarly adapted to their <HI>mili|tant</HI> condition is laid a&s;ide. The &s;word is laid down; and they betake them&s;elves to <HI>the pen of a ready writer,</HI> to commemorate the prai&s;es of him, by whom they overcame. Public ordinances, preaching, &s;acra|ments, &s;hall be honourably laid a&s;ide; there is <HI>no temple there,</HI> Rev. xxi&punc; 22. Sometimes the&s;e were &s;weet to them: but the travellers be|ing all got home, the inns, appointed for their entertainment by the way, are &s;hut up; the candles are put out, when the &s;un is ri&s;en; and the tabernacle u&s;ed in the wilderne&s;s is folded up, when the temple of glory is come in its room. Many of the &s;aints duties will then be laid a&s;ide; as one gives his &s;taff out of his hand, when he is come to the end of his journey. <HI>Praying</HI> &s;hall then be turned to prai&s;ing: and, there being no &s;in to confe&s;s, no wants to &s;eek the &s;upply of; <HI>confe&s;|&s;ion</HI> and <HI>petition</HI> &s;hall be &s;wallowed up in everla&s;ting <HI>thank&s;giving.</HI> There will be no <HI>mourning,</HI> in heaven: they have &s;own in tears, the reaping time of joy is come, <HI>and God &s;hall wipe away all tears from their eyes,</HI> Rev. xxi. 4. No need of <HI>mortification</HI> there; and <HI>&s;elf-ex|amination</HI> is then at an end. They will not need to <HI>watch</HI> any more; the danger is over. <HI>Patience</HI> has had its perfect work, and there is no u&s;e for it there. <HI>Faith</HI> is turned into &s;ight, and <HI>hope</HI> is &s;wallowed up in the ocean of &s;en&s;ible and full enjoyment. All the rebels are &s;ubdued, the &s;aints quietly &s;et on their throne: and &s;o the forces, needful in the time of the &s;piritual warfare, are di&s;banded; and they carry on their triumph in profounde&s;t peace.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> White garments were worn, on <HI>fe&s;tival days,</HI> in token of <HI>joy.</HI> And &s;o &s;hall the &s;aints be clothed in white raiment; for they &s;hall keep an everla&s;ting &s;abbath to the Lord, Heb. iv. 9. <HI>There remaineth therefore a re&s;t</HI> (or <HI>keeping of a &s;abbath) to the people of God.</HI> The &s;abbath, in the e&s;teem of &s;aints, is the queen of days: and they &s;hall have an endle&s;s <HI>sabbati&s;m</HI> in the kingdom of heaven; &s;o &s;hall their garments be always white. They will have an eternal <HI>re&s;t,</HI> with an uninterrupted joy:
<PB N="299" REF="045042_0296_101F804A2598F060">
for heaven is not a re&s;ting place, where men may &s;leep out an eternity; (there they re&s;t not day nor night) but their work is their re&s;t and continual recreation, and toil and wearine&s;s have no place there. They re&s;t there in God, who is the centre of their &s;ouls. Here they find the complement, or &s;atisfaction of all their de&s;ires; having the full enjoyment of God, and uninterrupted communion with him. This is the point, unto the which till the &s;oul come, it will al|ways be re&s;tle&s;s: but, that point reached, it re&s;ts; for he is the la&s;t end, and the &s;oul can go no farther. It cannot under&s;tand, will, nor de&s;ire more; but in him it has what is commen&s;urable to its boundle&s;s de&s;ires. This is the happy end of all the labours of the &s;aints; their toil and &s;orrows i&s;&s;ue in a joyful re&s;t. The <HI>Chaldeans</HI> mea&s;uring the na|tural day, put the day fir&s;t, and the night la&s;t: but the Jews counted the night fir&s;t, and the day la&s;t. Even &s;o, the wicked begin with a day of re&s;t and plea&s;ure, but end with a night of everla&s;ting toil and &s;orrow: but God's people have their gloomy night fir&s;t, and then comes their day of eternal re&s;t. The which <HI>Abraham,</HI> in the parable, ob&s;erved to the rich man in hell, Luke xvi. 25.
<Q>Son, remember that thou in thy life-time received&s;t thy good things, and likewi&s;e Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.</Q></P>
<P N="3">III. If one enquires <HI>where</HI> the kingdom of the &s;aints lies? It is not in this world; it lies in a <HI>better country, that is, an heavenly,</HI> (Heb. xi. 16.) a country better than the be&s;t of this world; name|ly, the heavenly <HI>Canaan, Immanuel</HI>'s land, where nothing is want|ing to complete the happine&s;s of the inhabitants. This is the happy <HI>country,</HI> ble&s;t with a perpetual &s;pring, and which yieldeth all things for nece&s;&s;ity, conveniency, and delight. There men &s;hall cat angels food; they &s;hall be entertained with <HI>the hidden manna,</HI> (Rev. ii. 17) without being &s;et to the painful gathering of it: they will be fed to the full, with the product of the land falling into their mouths, without the lea&s;t toil to them. That land enjoys an everla&s;ting day, for there is <HI>no night there,</HI> Rev. xxi. 25. An eternal &s;un-&s;hine beautifies this <HI>better country,</HI> but there is no &s;corching heat there: No clouds &s;hall be &s;een there for ever: yet it is not a land of drought; the trees of the Lord's planting are &s;et by the rivers of water, and &s;hall never want moi&s;ture, for they will have an eter|nal &s;upply of the Spirit, by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, from his Father. This is the country from whence our Lord came, and whither he is gone again: the country which all the holy patriarchs and pro|phets had their eye upon, while on earth; and which all the &s;aints, who have gone before us, have fought their way to; and unto which, the martyrs have joyfully &s;wimmed, through a &s;ea of blood. This earth is the place of the &s;aints pilgrimage: that is, their coun|try, where they find their everla&s;ting re&s;t.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The <HI>royal city is that great city, the holy Jeru&s;alem,</HI> de&s;cribed, at large, Rev. xxi. 10 to the end of the chapter. (It is true, &s;ome learned divines place this city in the earth: but the particulars of
<PB N="300" REF="045042_0297_101F80C9793AFC58">
the de&s;cription &s;eem to me to favour tho&s;e mo&s;t, who point us to the other world for it.) The &s;aints &s;hall reign in that city, who&s;e <HI>wall</HI> is of <HI>ja&s;per,</HI> (ver. 16) and <HI>the foundations of the wall garni&s;hed with all manner of precious &s;tones,</HI> (ver. 19.) and <HI>the &s;treets of pure gold,</HI> (ver. 20) &s;o that their feet &s;hall be &s;et on that, which the men of this world &s;et their hearts upon. This is the <HI>city God hath pre|pared for them,</HI> Heb. xi. 16. <HI>A city that hath foundations,</HI> (ver. 10.) <HI>A continuing city,</HI> (chap xiii. 14.) which &s;hall &s;tand and flouri&s;h, when all the cities of the world are laid in a&s;hes; and which &s;hall not be moved, when the foundations of the world are overturned. It is a city that never changeth its inhabitants: none of them &s;hall ever be removed out of it: for life and immortality reign there, and no death can enter into it. It is ble&s;&s;ed with a perfect and per|petual peace, and can never be in the lea&s;t di&s;turbed. Nothing from without can annoy it; <HI>the gates</HI> therefore are <HI>not &s;hut at all by day,</HI> and there is no night there, Rev. xxi. 25. There can no|thing from within trouble it. No want of provi&s;ion there; no &s;car|city; no di&s;cord among&s;t the inhabitants. Whatever contentions are among&s;t the &s;aints now; no ve&s;tige of their former jarrings &s;hall remain there. Love to God, and to one another, &s;hall be per|fected: and the&s;e of them, who &s;tood at greater di&s;tance here, will joyfully embrace and delight in one another there.</P>
<P N="5">V. The <HI>royal palace</HI> is Chri&s;t's <HI>Father's hou&s;e,</HI> in which <HI>are many man&s;ions,</HI> John xiv. 2. There &s;hall the &s;aints dwell for ever. That is the hou&s;e prepared for all the heirs of glory, even the&s;e of them who dwell in the meane&s;t cottage now, or have not where to lay their heads. As our Lord calls his &s;aints to a <HI>kingdom</HI>; he will pro|vide them a hou&s;e &s;uitable to the dignity he puts upon them. Heaven will be a convenient, &s;pacious, and glorious hou&s;e, for tho&s;e whom the King delighteth to honour. Never was a hou&s;e purcha&s;ed, at &s;o dear a rate as this, being the purcha&s;e of the Me|diator's blood; and no le&s;s could it be afforded for to them: never was there &s;o much ado, to fit inhabitants for a hou&s;e. The &s;aints were, by nature, utterly unfit for this hou&s;e, and human art and indu&s;try could not make them <HI>meet</HI> for it. But the Father gives the de&s;igned inhabitants to his Son, to be by him redeemed: the Son pays the price of their redemption, even his own precious blood; that, with the allowance of ju&s;tice, they may have acce&s;s to <HI>the hou&s;e:</HI> and the holy Spirit &s;anctifies them by his grace; that they may be <HI>meet</HI> to come in thither, where no unclean thing can enter. And no marvel, for it is <HI>the King's palace, they enter</HI> into, (P&s;al. xlv. 15.) The hou&s;e of the kingdom, where the great King keeps his court, where he has his throne, and &s;hews forth his glory, in a &s;ingular manner beyond what mortals can conceive.</P>

<P N="7">VII. They &s;hall have <HI>royal trea&s;ures,</HI> &s;ufficient to &s;upport the dignity they are advanced unto.

<P N="9">IX. <HI>The Society</HI> in this kingdom. What would royal power and authority, en&s;igns of royalty, riche&s;t trea&s;ures, and all other ad|vantages of a kingdom, avail without comfortable <HI>&s;ociety?</HI> Some crowned heads have had but a &s;orry life through the want of it: their palaces have been but unto them as pri&s;ons, and their badges of honour as chains on a pri&s;oner: while hated of all, they had none they could tru&s;t in, or whom they could have comfortable fellow&s;hip with. But the chief part of heaven's happine&s;s lies in the ble&s;&s;ed <HI>&s;ociety</HI> the &s;aints &s;hall have there. For clearing of which, con&s;ider the&s;e few things:</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The &s;ociety of the <HI>&s;aints,</HI> among them&s;elves, will be no &s;mall part of heaven's happine&s;s. The <HI>communion of &s;aints</HI> on earth is highly prized by all the&s;e who are travelling through the world unto <HI>Zion</HI>; and companions in &s;in can never have &s;uch true plea|&s;ure and delight in one another, as &s;ometime the Lord's people have in praying together, and conver&s;ing about the&s;e things which the world is a &s;tranger to. Here the &s;aints are but few in company, at be&s;t: and &s;ome of them are &s;o po&s;ted, as they &s;eem to them&s;elves to <HI>dwell alone:</HI> having no acce&s;s to &s;uch, as they could freely un|bo&s;om them&s;elves to, in the matter of their &s;piritual ca&s;e. They &s;igh and &s;ay,
<Q>Wo is me, for I am as when they have gathered the &s;ummer fruits&mdash;there is no clu&s;ter to eat&mdash;the good man is peri|&s;hed out of the earth,</Q>
Mic. vii 1, 2. But in <HI>the general a&s;&s;embly of the fir&s;t-born</HI> in heaven, none of all the &s;aints, who ever were, or will be on the earth, &s;hall be mi&s;&s;ing. They will be all of them together in one place, all po&s;&s;e&s;s one kingdom, and all &s;it down to|gether to the marriage-&s;upper of the Lamb. Here the be&s;t of the &s;aints want not their &s;inful imperfections, making their &s;ociety le&s;s comfortable: but there they &s;hall be perfect, without <HI>&s;pot or wrinkle, or any &s;uch thing,</HI> Eph. v. 27.

<Q>&s;hall &s;hine as the bright|ne&s;s of the firmament,</Q>
Dan. xii. 3</P>
<P>There we will &s;ee <HI>Adam and Eve</HI> in the heavenly paradi&s;e, freely eating of the tree of life; <HI>Abraham, I&s;aac</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI> and all the holy patriarchs, no more wandering from land to land, but come to their everla&s;ting re&s;t; all the prophets feeding their eyes on the glory of him, of who&s;e coming they prophe&s;ied; the twelve Apo&s;|tles of the Lamb, &s;itting on their twelve thrones; all the holy mar|tyrs in their long white robes, with their crowns on their heads the godly kings advanced to a kingdom which cannot be moved; and them <HI>that turn many to righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> &s;hining <HI>as the &s;tars for ever and ever.</HI> There will we &s;ee our godly friends, relations and ac|quaintances, <HI>pillars in the temple of temple of God,</HI> to <HI>go no more out</HI> from us. And it is more than probable, that the &s;aints will know one another in heaven: that, at lea&s;t, they will know their friends, relatives, and the&s;e they were acquainted with on earth, and &s;uch as have been mo&s;t eminent in the church: howbeit that knowledge will be purged from all earthly thoughts and affections. This &s;eems to be included in that perfection of happine&s;s to which the &s;aints &s;hall be advanced there. If <HI>Adam</HI> knew who and what <HI>Eve</HI> was at fir&s;t &s;ight, when the Lord God brought her to him, (Gen. ii. 23, 24) why &s;hould one que&s;tion, but hu&s;bands and wives, parents and chil|dren, will know each other in glory? if the <HI>The&s;&s;alonians,</HI> convert|ed by <HI>Paul</HI>'s mini&s;try, &s;hall be his <HI>crown of rejoicing, in the pre&s;ence of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, at his coming,</HI> (1 The&s;&s;. ii 19.) Why may not one conclude, that mini&s;ters &s;hall know their people, and people their mini&s;ters in heaven? And if the di&s;ciples, on the mount of transfiguration, knew <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Elias,</HI> whom they had never &s;een before, (Matth. ii. 19) we have ground to think, we &s;hall know them too, and &s;uch as they, when we come to heaven. The com|munion of &s;aints &s;hall be mo&s;t intimate there; <HI>they &s;hall &s;it down with</HI> Abraham, I&s;aac, <HI>and</HI> Jacob, <HI>in the kingdom of heaven,</HI> Matth. viii. 11. <HI>Lazarus</HI> was carried by the angels into <HI>Abraham's bo&s;om,</HI> (Luke xvi. 23) which denotes mo&s;t intimate and familiar &s;ociety. And though diver&s;ity of <HI>tongues &s;hall cea&s;e,</HI> (1 Cor. xiii. 8.) I make no que&s;tion, but there will be an u&s;e of &s;peech in heaven; and that the &s;aints will glorify God in their bodies there, as well as in their &s;pirits, &s;peaking forth his prai&s;es with an audible voice. (As for the language, we &s;hall under&s;tand, what it is, when we come thi|ther.) When <HI>Paul</HI> was caught up to the third heaven, the &s;eat of the ble&s;&s;ed, he <HI>heard</HI> there <HI>un&s;peakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter,</HI> 2 Cor. xii. 4. <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Elias,</HI> on the mount with Chri&s;t, <HI>talked with him,</HI> Matth. xvii. 3. and <HI>&s;pake of his di&s;ea&s;e which he &s;hould accompli&s;h at Jeru&s;alem,</HI> Luke ix. 31.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The &s;aints will have the &s;ociety of all the holy angels there. <HI>And aumerable company of angels</HI> &s;hall be companions to them in their glorified &s;tate. Happy were the &s;hepherds, who heard the

&s;ong of the heavenly ho&s;t, when Chri&s;t was born, but thrice happy they, who &s;hall join their voices with theirs, in the choir of &s;aints and angels in heaven, when he &s;hall be glorified in all, who &s;hall be about him there. Then &s;hall we be brought acquainted with the ble&s;&s;ed &s;pirits, who never &s;inned. How bright will the&s;e morning-&s;tars &s;hine in the holy place! they were mini&s;tring &s;pirits to the heirs of &s;alvation, loved them for their Lord and Ma&s;ter's &s;ake; encamped round about them, to pre&s;erve them from danger; how joyfully will they welcome them to their everla&s;ting habitations; and rejoice to &s;ee them come at length to their kingdom, as the tutor doth in the pro&s;perity of his pupils! The &s;aints &s;hall be no more afraid of them, as &s;ometime they were wont to be: they &s;hall then have put off mortality, and infirmities of the fle&s;h, and be them&s;elves, <HI>as the an|gels of God,</HI> fit to entertain communion and fellow&s;hip with the&s;e &s;hin|ing ones. And both being brought under one head, the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; they &s;hall join in the prai&s;es of God, and of the Lamb, <HI>&s;aying, with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was &s;lain,</HI> &amp;c. Rev. v. 11, 12. Whether the angels &s;ha]l (as &s;ome think) a&s;&s;ume airy bodies, that they may be &s;een by the bodily eyes of the &s;aints, and be in nearer capacity to conver&s;e with them, I know not: but as they want not ways of conver&s;e among&s;t them&s;elves, we have rea&s;on to think, that conver&s;ation, betwixt them and the &s;aints, &s;hall not be for ever block|ed up.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> They &s;hall have &s;ociety with the <HI>Lord</HI> him&s;elf in heaven, glorious communion with <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> which is the perfection of happine&s;s. I chu&s;e to &s;peak of communion with God, and the man Chri&s;t together; becau&s;e as we derive our grace from the Lamb, &s;o we will derive our glory from him too; the man Chri&s;t being (if I may be allowed the expre&s;&s;ion) the centre of the divine glory in heaven, from whence it is diffu&s;ed unto all the &s;aints. This &s;eems to be taught us by the&s;e &s;criptures, which expre&s;s heaven's happine&s;s by <HI>being with Chri&s;t,</HI> Luke xxiii. 43. <HI>This day &s;halt thou be with me in paradi&s;e,</HI> John xxvii. 24. <HI>Father I will that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e al&s;o, whom thou ha&s;t given me, be with me.</HI> (And remarkable to this purpo&s;e is what follows, <HI>that they may behold my glory.</HI>) 1 The&s;&s;. iv. 17. <HI>So &s;hall we ever be with the Lord,</HI> to wit, the Lord Chri&s;t, whom we &s;hall meet in the air. This al&s;o &s;eems to be the import of the&s;e &s;criptures, wherein <HI>God</HI> and the <HI>Lamb,</HI> the &s;lain Saviour, are jointly &s;poken of, in the point of the happine&s;s of the &s;aints in heaven, Rev. vii. 17.
<Q>For the Lamb which is in the mid&s;t of the throne, &s;hall feed them, and &s;hall lead them unto living foun|tains of waters: and God &s;hall wipe away all tears from their eyes,</Q>

Here lies the chief happine&s;s of the &s;aints in heaven, that without which they could never be happy, though lodged in that glorious

There they are brought near to the throne of the great King, and &s;tand before him, where he &s;hews his inconceivable glory. There they have <HI>the taber|nacle of God,</HI> on which the cloud of glory re&s;ts, the all glorious human nature of Chri&s;t, wherein the fulne&s;s of the Godhead dwells, not vailed as in the days of his humiliation, but &s;hining through that ble&s;&s;ed fle&s;h, (that all the &s;aints may behold <HI>his glory</HI>) and making that body more glorious than a thou&s;and &s;ons: &s;o that the city has no need of the &s;un, nor of the moon, but <HI>the glory of God doth lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof,</HI> (properly, <HI>the candle thereof</HI>) Rev xxi 23. <HI>i. e.</HI> The Lamb is the <HI>luminary,</HI> or luminous body, which gives light to the city; as the &s;un and moon now give light to the world, or as a candle lightens a dark room: and the <HI>light</HI> proceeding from that glorious luminary, for the city is the <HI>glory</HI> of God.

It was &s;ometimes laid a&s;ide, as a &s;tone di&s;allowed of the build|ers: but now it is, and for ever will be, the <HI>light</HI> or luminary of that city; and that, <HI>like unto a &s;tone mo&s;t precious, even like a ja&s;per &s;tone clear as cry&s;tal,</HI> ver. 11.</P>
<P>Who can conceive the happine&s;s of the &s;aints, in the pre&s;ence|-chamber of the great King, where he &s;its in his chair of &s;tate, making his glory eminently to appear in the <HI>man Chri&s;t?</HI> His gracious pre|&s;ence makes a mighty change upon the &s;aints in this world: his glo|rious pre&s;ence in heaven then mu&s;t needs &s;crew up their graces to their perfection, and elevate their capacities. The &s;aints do experience, that the pre&s;ence of God now with them in his <HI>grace,</HI> can make a little heaven of a &s;ort of hell: how great then mu&s;t the glory of heaven be, by his pre&s;ence there in his <HI>glory!</HI> If a candle, in &s;ome &s;ort, beauti|fies a cottage or pri&s;on, how will the &s;hining &s;un beautify a palace or paradi&s;e!

This glorious pre&s;ence of God in heaven will put a glory on the &s;aints them&s;elves.

<P N="2">2<HI>dly,</HI> The &s;aints in heaven &s;hall have the full <HI>enjoyment</HI> of God and of the Lamb. This is it that perfectly <HI>&s;atisfies</HI> the rational creature; and here is the &s;aints everla&s;ting re&s;t. This will make up all their wants, and fill the de&s;ires of their &s;ouls, which after all here obtained, &s;till cry, <HI>Give give,</HI> not without &s;ome anxiety; becau&s;e though they do enjoy God, yet they do not enjoy him fully. As to the way and manner of this enjoyment, our Lord tells us, John xvii. 3.
<Q>This is life eternal, that they may know thee the only true God, and Je&s;us Chri&s;t whom thou ha&s;t &s;ent.</Q>
Now there are two ways, how a de&s;irable object is known mo&s;t perfectly and &s;atisfyingly; the one is by <HI>&s;ight,</HI> the other by <HI>experience:</HI> &s;ight &s;atisfies the under&s;tanding, and experience &s;atisfies the will. Accordingly one may &s;ay, that the &s;aints enjoy God and the Lamb in heaven, (1.) By an intuitive knowledge. (2.) By an experimental knowledge, both of them perfect, I mean, in re&s;pect of the capacity of the creature; for otherwi&s;e a creature's perfect knowledge of an infinite Being is impo&s;&s;ible. The &s;aints below enjoy God, in that knowledge they have of him by <HI>report,</HI> from his his holy word which they believe; they &s;ee him likewi&s;e darkly <HI>in the gla&s;s</HI> of ordinances, which do, as it were, repre&s;ent the bridegroom's picture, or &s;hadow, while he is ab&s;ent: they have al&s;o &s;ome experimental knowledge of him, they <HI>ta&s;te that God is good,</HI> and <HI>that the Lord is gracious.</HI> But the &s;aints above &s;hall not need a good report of the King, they &s;hall &s;ee him&s;elf; therefore faith cea&s;eth: they will behold his own face; therefore ordinances are no more; there is no need of a gla&s;s: they &s;hall drink, and drink abundantly of that whereof they have ta&s;ted; and &s;o hope cea&s;eth, for they are at the utmo&s;t bounds of their de&s;ires.</P>
<P N="1">1. The &s;aints in heaven &s;hall <HI>enjoy</HI> God and the Lamb, by <HI>&s;ight,</HI> and that in a mo&s;t perfect manner, 1 Cor. xiii. 12. <HI>For now we &s;ee through a gla&s;s darkly; but then face to face.</HI> Here our &s;ight is but mediate, as by a gla&s;s, in which we &s;ee not things them&s;elves, but the images of things: but there we &s;hall have an immediate view of God and the Lamb.

The Lord doth now con|ver&s;e with his &s;aints, through the latte&s;&s;es of ordinances: but then &s;hall they be in the pre&s;ence-chamber with him. There is a vail now on the glorious face as to us: but when we come to the upper hou&s;e, that vail, through which &s;ome rays of beauty are now darted, will be found entirely taken off; and then &s;hall glorious excellencies and per|fections, not &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">am by mortals, be clearly di&s;covered, for we &s;hall <HI>&s;ee his face,</HI> Rev. xxii. 4.

For &s;ince the union betwixt Chri&s;t and the &s;aints is never di&s;&s;olved but they continue his members for ever; and the members cannot draw their life, but from their Head; &s;eeing that which is dependent on the head, as to the vital influence, is no member: there|fore Je&s;us Chri&s;t will remain the everla&s;ting <HI>bond</HI> of <HI>union</HI> betwixt God and the &s;aints; from whence their eternal life &s;hall &s;pring, John xvii. 2, 3.
<Q>Thou ha&s;t given him power overall fle&s;h, that he &s;hould give eternal life to as many as thou ha&s;t given him. And this is life eter|nal, that they might know thee the only true God, &amp;c. Ver. 22, 23. And the glory which thou gave&s;t me, I have given them, that they may be one, even as we are one: I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one.</Q>
Wherefore the <HI>immediate</HI> enjoyment of God in heaven is to be under&s;tood, in re&s;pect of the laying a&s;ide of word and &s;acraments, and &s;uch external means, as we enjoy God by in this world; but not, as if the &s;aints &s;hould then ca&s;t off their dependence on their Head for vital influences: nay,
<Q>the Lamb which is in the mid&s;t of the throne, &s;hall feed them, and &s;hall lead them unto living fountains of waters,</Q>

<P>Now when we &s;hall behold him, who died for us, that we might live for evermore, who&s;e matchle&s;s love made him &s;wim through the

Red-&s;ea, of God's wrath, to make a path in the mid&s;t of it for us, by which we might pa&s;s &s;afely to <HI>Canaan's</HI> land: then we will &s;ee what a glorious One he was, who &s;uffered all this for us; what entertain|ment he had in the upper-hou&s;e; what hallelujahs of angels could not hinder him to hear the groans of a per&s;hing multitude on earth, and to come down for their help: and what a glory he laid a&s;ide for us. Then will we be more
<Q>able to comprehend with all &s;aints, what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and heighth: and to know the love of Chri&s;t, which pa&s;&s;eth knowledge,</Q>
Eph. iii. 19 When the &s;aints &s;hall remember, that the waters of wrath he was plunged into, are the wells of &s;alvation from whence they draw all their joy; that they have got the cup of &s;alvation, in exchange of the cup of wrath his Father gave him to drink, which his &s;inle&s;s human nature &s;hivered at: how will their hearts leap within them, burn with &s;eraphick love, like coals of juniper, and the arch of heaven ring with their &s;ongs of &s;al|vation? The <HI>Jews</HI> celebrating the fea&s;t of tabernacles, (which was the mo&s;t joyful of all their fea&s;ts, and la&s;ted &s;even days) went once every day about the altar, &s;inging ho&s;anna, with their myrtle, palm and willow-branches in their hand, (the two former &s;igns of victory, the la&s;t of cha&s;tity) in the mean time bending their boughs towards the altar. When the &s;aints are pre&s;ented <HI>as a cha&s;te virgin to Chri&s;t,</HI> and as conquerors have got their <HI>palms in their hands,</HI> how joyfully will they compa&s;s the altar evermore; and &s;ing their ho&s;annas, (or rather their hallelujahs) about it, bending their palms towards it, ac|knowledging them&s;elves to owe all unto the Lamb that was &s;lain, and redeemed them with his blood! and to this agrees what <HI>John</HI> &s;aw, Rev. vii 9, 10.
<Q>A great multitude&mdash;&s;tood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands: and cried with a loud voice, &s;aying, Salvation to our God which &s;itteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.</Q></P>
<P N="2">(2.) They &s;hall <HI>&s;ee God,</HI> Matth. v. 8. They will be happy in &s;eeing the Father, Son, and holy Gho&s;t (not with their bodily eyes, in re&s;pect of which God is <HI>invi&s;ible</HI> 1 Tim i 17. but) with the eyes of their un|der&s;tanding; being ble&s;t with the mo&s;t perfect, full, and clear know|ledge of God and divine things, which the creature is capable of. This is called <HI>the beatifick vi&s;ion,</HI> and is the perfection of the <HI>under&s;tanding,</HI> the utmo&s;t term thereof. It is but an ob&s;cure delineation of the glory of God, that mortals can have on earth; a &s;ight, as it were of his <HI>back part,</HI> Exod. xxxiii. 23. But there they will &s;ee his <HI>face,</HI> Rev. xxii. 4. They &s;hall &s;ee him in the fulne&s;s of his glory, and behold him <HI>fixedly;</HI> whereas it is but a <HI>pa&s;&s;ing</HI> view they can have of him here, Exod. xxxiv. 6. There is a va&s;t difference betwixt the &s;ight of a king in his night-clothes, quickly pa&s;&s;ing by us; and a fixed lei&s;ure view of him &s;itting on his throne in his royal robes, his crown on his head, and his &s;eptre in his hand: &s;uch a difference will there be, between the greate&s;t manife&s;tation of God that ever a &s;aint had on earth; and the di&s;play of his glory that &s;hall be &s;een in heaven. There the &s;aints
<PB N="309" REF="045042_0306_101F806159A5CBC0">
&s;hall eternally, without interruption, feed their eyes upon him, and be ever viewing his glorious perfections. And as their bodily eyes &s;hall be &s;trengthened and fitted, to behold the glorious maje&s;ty of the man Chri&s;t; as eagles gaze on the &s;un, without being blinded thereby: &s;o their <HI>minds</HI> &s;hall have &s;uch an elevation, as will fit them to &s;ee God in his glory <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> capacities &s;hall be enlarged, according to the mea&s;ure in which he &s;hall be plea&s;ed to communicate him&s;elf unto them for their compleat happine&s;s.</P>
<P>This bli&s;sful &s;ight of God, being quite above our pre&s;ent capacities, we mu&s;t needs be much in the dark about it. But it &s;eems to be &s;omething el&s;e, than the fight of that <HI>glory,</HI> which we will &s;ee with our bodily eyes, in the &s;aints and in the man Chri&s;t, or any other &s;plendor or refulgence from the Godhead what&s;oever&punc; for no created thing can be our chief good and happine&s;s, nor fully &s;atisfy our &s;ouls; and it is plain, that the&s;e things are &s;omewhat different from God him&s;elf. Therefore I conceive, that the &s;ouls of the &s;aints &s;hall &s;ee God him|&s;elf: &s;o the &s;criptures teach us, that we &s;hall <HI>&s;ee face to face, and know even as we are known,</HI> 1 Cor xiii 12. And that <HI>we &s;hall &s;ee him as he is,</HI> 1 John iii. 12. Howbeit the &s;aints can never have an adequate con|ception of God; they cannot comprehend that which is infinite. They may touch the mountain, but cannot gra&s;p it in their arms They cannot with one glance of their eye, behold what grows on every &s;ide: but the divine perfections will be an unbounded field, in which the glorified &s;hall walk eternally, &s;eeing more and more of <HI>God:</HI> &s;ince they can never come to the end of that which is infinite. They may bring their ve&s;&s;els to this ocean every moment, and fill them with new waters. What a ravi&s;hing &s;ight would it be, to &s;ee all the per|fections, and lovely qualities, that are &s;cattered here and there among the creatures, gathered together into one! but even &s;uch a &s;ight would be infinitely below this bli&s;sful &s;ight the &s;aints &s;hall have in heaven. For they &s;hall &s;ee God, in whom all the&s;e perfections &s;hall eminently appear, with infinitely more; whereof there is no ve&s;tige to be found in the creature. In him &s;hall they &s;ee every thing de&s;ira|ble, and nothing but what is de&s;irable.</P>
<P>Then &s;hall they be perfectly &s;atisfied, as to the love of God towards them, which they are now ready to que&s;tion on every turn. They will be no more &s;et to per&s;uade them&s;elves of it, by marks, &s;igns, and te&s;timonies: they will have an <HI>intuitive</HI> knowledge of it. They &s;hall (with the profounde&s;t reverence be it &s;poken) look into the heart of God, and there &s;ee the love he bore to them from all eternity, and the love and good-will he will bear to them for evermore. The glorified &s;hall have a mo&s;t clear and di&s;tinct under&s;tanding of <HI>divine truths,</HI> for <HI>in his light we &s;hall &s;ee light,</HI> P&s;al. xxxvi. 9. The light of glory will be a compleat commentary on the <HI>Bible,</HI> and loo&s;e all the hard and knotty que&s;tions in divinity. There is no joy on earth, com|parable to that which ari&s;eth from the di&s;covery of truth; no di&s;co|very of truth comparable to the di&s;covery of <HI>&s;cripture-truth,</HI> made by

the Spirit of the Lord unto the &s;oul. <HI>I rejoice at thy word,</HI> &s;ays the P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>as one that findeth great &s;poil,</HI> P&s;al. cxix. 162. Yet it is but an imperfect di&s;covery we have of it while here. How ravi&s;hing then will it be, to &s;ee the opening of the whole trea&s;ure, hid in that field! they &s;hall al&s;o be let into the under&s;tanding of <HI>the works of God.</HI> The beauty in the works of creation and providence will then be &s;et in a due light. Natural knowledge will be brought to perfection by the light of glory. The web of providence concerning the church, and all men what&s;oever, will then be cut out, and laid before the eyes of the &s;aints, and it will appear a mo&s;t beautiful mixture; &s;o as they &s;hall &s;ay together, on the view of it, <HI>he hath done all things well.</HI> But, in a &s;pecial manner, the work of redemption &s;hall be the eternal won|der of the &s;aints, and they will admire and prai&s;e the glorious con|trivance for ever. Then &s;hall they get a full view of its &s;uitablene&s;s to the divine perfections, and to the ca&s;e of &s;inners: and clearly read the covenant, that pa&s;t betwixt the Father and the Son, from all eternity, touching their &s;alvation. They &s;hall for ever wonder and prai&s;e, and prai&s;e and wonder at the my&s;teries of wi&s;dom and love, goodne&s;s and holine&s;s, mercy and ju&s;tice, appearing in the glorious device. Their &s;ouls &s;hall be eternally &s;atisfied with the <HI>fight</HI> of God him&s;elf, and of their <HI>election</HI> by the Father, their <HI>re|demption</HI> by the Son, and <HI>application</HI> thereof to them by the Holy Spirit.</P>
<P N="2">2. The &s;aints in heaven &s;hall enjoy God in Chri&s;t by <HI>experimen|tal knowledge,</HI> which is, when the object it&s;elf is given and po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed. This is the participation of the divine <HI>goodne&s;s</HI> in full mea&s;ure; which is the perfection of the <HI>will,</HI> and utmo&s;t term thereof. <HI>The Lamb &s;hall lead them unto living fountains of waters,</HI> Rev. vii. 17. The&s;e are no other but God him&s;elf, <HI>the fountain of living waters,</HI> who will fully and freely communicate him&s;elf unto them. He will pour out of his goodne&s;s eternally into their &s;ouls: and then &s;hall they have a mo&s;t lively &s;en&s;ation, in the innermo&s;t part of their &s;ouls, of all that goodne&s;s they heard of, and believed to be in him; and of what they &s;ee in him by the light of glory. This will be an everla&s;ting practical expo&s;ition of that word, which men and angels cannot &s;ufficiently unfold, to wit, God him&s;elf &s;hall&mdash;<HI>be their God,</HI> Rev. xi. 3. God will communicate him&s;elf unto them <HI>fully:</HI> they will no more be &s;et to ta&s;te of the <HI>&s;treams</HI> of divine goodne&s;s in ordinances, as they were wont, but &s;hall drink at the <HI>fountain-head.</HI> They will be no more entertained with &s;ips and drops, but filled with all the fulne&s;s of God. And this will be the entertainment of <HI>every</HI> &s;aint: for though in created things, what is given to one, is withheld from another; yet an infinite good can fully communicate it&s;elf to all, and fill all. The&s;e who are <HI>heirs of God,</HI> the great heritage, &s;hall then enter into a full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their inheritances: and the Lord will open his trea&s;ures of <HI>goodne&s;s</HI> unto them, that their enjoyment may be full. They &s;hall not be &s;tinted to any

mea&s;ure: but the enjoyment &s;hall go as far as their enlarged capa|cities can reach. As a narrow ve&s;&s;el cannot contain the ocean, to neither can the finite creature comprehend an infinite good: but no mea&s;ure &s;hall be &s;et to the enjoyment, but what ari&s;eth from the capacity of the creature. So that, although there be degrees of glory, yet all &s;hall be filled, and have what they can <HI>hold;</HI> tho' &s;ome would be capable to hold <HI>more</HI> than others, there will be no <HI>want</HI> to any of them, all &s;hall be fully &s;atisfied, and perfectly ble&s;|&s;ed in the full enjoyment of divine goodne&s;s, according to their enlarged capacities. As when bottles of different &s;izes are filled, &s;ome contain more, others le&s;s; yet all of them have what they can contain. The glorified &s;hall have <HI>all,</HI> in God, for the &s;atisfaction of all their de&s;ires. No created thing can afford &s;atisfaction to <HI>all</HI> our de&s;ires: clothes may warm us, but they cannot feed us; the light is comfortable, but cannot nouri&s;h us. But in God we &s;hall have all our de&s;ires, and we &s;hall de&s;ire nothing <HI>without</HI> him. They &s;hall be the happy ones, that de&s;ire nothing but what is truly de&s;irable; and withal have all they de&s;ire. God will be <HI>all in all</HI> to the &s;aints; he will be their life, health, riches, honour, peace, and all good things. He will communicate him&s;elf <HI>freely</HI> to them: the door of acce&s;s to him &s;hall never be &s;hut again, for one moment. They may, when they will, take of the fruits of the tree of life, for they will find it on each &s;ide the river, Rev. xxii. 2. There will be no vail betwixt God and them, to be drawn a&s;ide; but his ful|ne&s;s &s;hall ever &s;tand open to them. No door to knock at, in heaven; no a&s;king to go before receiving; the Lord will allow his people an unre&s;trained familiarity with him&s;elf there.</P>
<P>Now they are in part made <HI>partakers of the divine nature:</HI> but then they &s;hall perfectly partake of it; that is to &s;ay, God will communicate to them his own image, make all his goodne&s;s not only <HI>pa&s;s before them,</HI> but pa&s;s into them, and &s;tamp the image of all his own perfections upon them, &s;o far as the creature is capable to receive the &s;ame; from whence &s;hall re&s;ult a perfect <HI>likene&s;s</HI> to him, in all things in or about them, which completes the <HI>happine&s;s</HI> of the creature. And this is what the P&s;almi&s;t &s;eems to have had in view, P&s;al. xvii. 15. <HI>I &s;hall be &s;atisfied when I awake, with thy likene&s;s</HI>; the perfection of God's image, following upon the beati|fick vi&s;ion. And &s;o &s;ays <HI>John,</HI> 1 John iii 2 <HI>We &s;hall be like him; for we &s;hall &s;ee him as he is.</HI> Hence there &s;hall be a mo&s;t clo&s;e and in|timate union betwixt God and the &s;aints: God &s;hall be in them, and they in God, in the way of a mo&s;t glorious and perfect union; for then &s;hall they dwell in love made perfect. <HI>God is love, and he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him,</HI> 1 John iv. 16. How will the &s;aints knit with God, and he with them; when he &s;hall &s;ee nothing in them but his own image; when their love &s;hall arrive at its perfection, no nature, but the divine nature, being left in them, and all imperfection &s;wallowed up in that glorious tran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">for|mation

<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> From this glorious <HI>pre&s;ence</HI> and <HI>enjoyment</HI> &s;hall ari&s;e an un&s;peakable <HI>joy,</HI> which the &s;aints &s;hall be filled with. <HI>In thy pre|&s;ence is fulne&s;s of joy,</HI> P&s;al. xvi. 11.

are they going? But &s;tay a little. O fooli&s;h world! From the &s;ame mouth, whence they had the call they are now following, another call &s;hall come which will make amends for all, <HI>Come, ye ble&s;&s;ed of my Father, inherit the heaven.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;aints &s;hall find an expre&s;&s;ible &s;weetne&s;s in this call, to <HI>come.</HI> (1.) Hereby Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;hews his <HI>de&s;ire</HI> of their <HI>&s;ociety</HI> in the up|per hou&s;e, that they may be ever with him there. Thus he will open his heart unto them, as &s;ometimes he did to his Father con|cerning them, &s;aying, <HI>Father, I will that they&mdash;be with me, where I am,</HI> John xvii. 24. Now <HI>the travel of his &s;oul</HI> &s;tands before the throne, not only the &s;ouls, but the bodies he has redeemed: and they mu&s;t <HI>come,</HI> for he mu&s;t be compleatly &s;atisfied. (2.) Hereby they are &s;olemnly <HI>invited</HI> to the marriage &s;upper of the Lamb. They were invited to the lower table, by the voice of the &s;ervants, and the &s;ecret workings of the Spirit within them; and they came, and did partake of the fea&s;t of divine communications in the lower hou&s;e: but Je&s;us Chri&s;t in per&s;on &s;hall invite them, before all the world, to the higher table. (3.) By this he <HI>admits</HI> them into the <HI>man&s;ions</HI> of glory. The keys of heaven hang at the girdle of our royal Mediator: <HI>All power in heaven</HI> is given to him, (Mat. xxvii. 18.) and none get in thither, but whom he admits. When they were living on earth, with the re&s;t of the world, he opened the everla&s;ting doors of their hearts, entred into them him&s;elf, and &s;hut them again; &s;o as &s;in could never re-enter, to reign there as formerly: and now he opens heaven's doors to them, draws his doves into the ark, and &s;huts them in there; &s;o as the law, death and hell, can never get them out again. The &s;aints in this life were &s;till <HI>labouring to enter into that re&s;t:</HI> but Satan was always pulling them back, their corruption always drawing them down; in &s;o much that they have &s;ometimes been left to hang by a hair of a promi&s;e, (if I may be allowed the expre&s;&s;ion) not without fears of falling into the lake of fire: but now Chri&s;t gives the word for their admi&s;&s;ion; they are brought in, and put beyond all hazard. <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> Thus he &s;peaks to them, as the per&s;on <HI>introducing</HI> them in|to the kingdom, into the pre&s;ence-chamber of the Great King, and unto the throne. JESUS CHRIST is the Great Secretary of heaven, who&s;e it is to bring the &s;aints into the gracious pre&s;ence of God: and to whom alone it belongs to bring them into the glorious pre|&s;ence of God in heaven. Truly heaven would be a &s;trange place to them, if Je&s;us was not there: but the Son will introduce his brethren into his Father's kingdom; they &s;hall go in <HI>with him to the marriage,</HI> Matth. xxv. 10.</P>
<P N="2">II. Let us con&s;ider in what <HI>quality</HI> they are introduced by him.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> He brings them in as <HI>the ble&s;&s;ed of his Father:</HI> &s;o runs the call from the throne, <HI>Come ye ble&s;&s;ed of my Father,</HI> &amp;c. It is <HI>Chri&s;t's Father's hou&s;e</HI> they are to <HI>come</HI> into: therefore he puts them in mind, that they are ble&s;&s;ed of his Father; dear to the Father, as
<PB N="315" REF="045042_0312_101F807090F5CFE8">
well as to him&s;elf. This is it that makes heaven <HI>home</HI> to them; namely, that it is Chri&s;t's Father's hou&s;e, where we may be a&s;&s;ured of welcome, being married to the Son, and being his Father's choice for that very end. He brings them in for <HI>his Father's &s;ake,</HI> as well as for his own: they are the ble&s;&s;ed of his Father; who, as he is the fountain of the Deity, is al&s;o the fountain of all ble&s;&s;ings conferred on the children of men. They are the&s;e to whom God <HI>de&s;igned well</HI> from eternity. They were ble&s;&s;ed in the eternal pur|po&s;e of God, being elected to everla&s;ting life: at the opening of the book of life, their names are found written therein. So that, bringing them to the kingdom, he doth but bring them to what the Father, from all eternity, de&s;igned for them; being &s;aved by the Son, they are <HI>&s;aved according to his (i. e.</HI> the Father's) <HI>purpo&s;e,</HI> 2 Tim. i. 9. They are the&s;e to whom the Father has <HI>&s;poken well.</HI> He &s;pake well to them in his word, which mu&s;t now receive its full accompli&s;h|ment. They had his promi&s;e of the kingdom, lived and died in the faith of it: and now they come to receive the thing promi&s;ed, Unto them he has <HI>done well.</HI> A gift is often in &s;cripture called <HI>a ble&s;&s;ing:</HI> and God's ble&s;&s;ing is ever real, like <HI>I&s;aac</HI>'s ble&s;&s;ing, by which <HI>Jacob</HI> became his heir: they were all by grace ju&s;tified, &s;anctified, and made to per&s;evere unto the end; now they are rai&s;ed up in glory, and being tried, &s;tand in the judgment: what remains then, but that God crown his own work of grace in them, in giving them their kingdom, in the full <HI>enjoyment</HI> of him&s;elf for ever? <HI>Finally,</HI> They are the&s;e whom God has <HI>con&s;ecrated:</HI> the which al&s;o is a &s;cripture notion of <HI>ble&s;&s;ing,</HI> 1 Cor. x. 16. God &s;et them apart for him&s;elf, to be kings and prie&s;ts unto him; and the Mediator intro|duceth them as &s;uch to their kingdom and prie&s;thood.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Chri&s;t introduceth them as <HI>heirs of the kingdom</HI> to the actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. <HI>Come, ye ble&s;&s;ed, inherit the kingdom.</HI> They are the children of God, by regeneration and adoption: <HI>And if children, then heirs, heirs of God, and joint heirs with Chri&s;t,</HI> Rom. viii. 17. Now is the general a&s;&s;embly of the fir&s;t-born before the throne: their minority is overpa&s;t, and the time appointed of the Father for their receiving of their inheritance is come. The Mediator <HI>purcha&s;ed</HI> the inheritance for them with his own blood; their rights and evidences were drawn long ago, and regi&s;tred in the Bible; nay, they had <HI>in&s;oftment</HI> of their inheritance in the per|&s;on of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as their proxy, when he a&s;cended into heaven, <HI>whither the forerunner is, for us, entered,</HI> Heb. vi. 20. Nothing remain|eth, but that they enter into per&s;onal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion thereof, which begun at death, is perfected at the la&s;t day: when the &s;aints, in their bodies as well as their &s;ouls, go into their <HI>kingdom.</HI></P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> They are introduced to it, as <HI>the&s;e it was prepared for from the foundation of the world.</HI> The kingdom was prepared for them in the eternal purpo&s;e of God, before they or any of them had a being, which &s;hews it to be a gift of free grace to them. It was.

from eternity the divine purpo&s;e, that there &s;hould be &s;uch a king|dom for the elect; and that all impediments which might mar their acce&s;s to it, &s;hould be removed out of the way; and withal, by the &s;ame eternal decree, every one's place in it was determined and &s;et apart, to be re&s;erved for him, that each of the children coming home at length into their Father's hou&s;e, might find his own place awaiting him and ready for him; as at <HI>Saul</HI>'s table <HI>David</HI>'s <HI>place was empty,</HI> when he was not there to occupy it him&s;elf, 1 Sam. xx. 25. And now that the appointed time is come, they are brought in to take their &s;everal places in glory, &s;et apart and re&s;erved for them, till they &s;hould come at them.</P>
<P>USE. I &s;hall &s;hut up my di&s;cour&s;e on this &s;ubject, with a word of <HI>application,</HI> (1.) To all who claim a right to this kingdom, (2.) To the&s;e who have indeed a right to it. (3.) To the&s;e who have not a right thereto.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Since it is evident, there is no promi&s;cuous <HI>admi&s;&s;ion</HI> into the kingdom of heaven, and none do obtain it, but the&s;e who&s;e <HI>claim</HI> to it is &s;olemnly tried by the great Judge, and, after trial, &s;u&s;tained as good and valid; it is nece&s;&s;ary that all of us impartially <HI>try</HI> and examine, whether, according to the laws of the kingdom, contained in the holy &s;criptures, we can verify and make good our <HI>claim</HI> to this <HI>kingdom?</HI> The hopes of heaven, which mo&s;t men have, are built on &s;uch &s;andy foundations, as can never abide the trial; having no ground in the word, but in their own deluded fancy: &s;uch hopes will leave tho&s;e who entertain them, mi&s;erably di&s;ap|pointed at la&s;t. Wherefore it is not only our duty, but our in|tere&s;t, to put the matter to a fair trail, in time. If we find, we have no right to heaven indeed, we are yet in the way; and what we have not, we may obtain: but if we find we have a right to it, we will then have the comfort of a happy pro&s;pect into eter|nity; which is the greate&s;t comfort one is capable of in the world. If ye enquire, <HI>How ye may know whither ye have a right to heaven, or not?</HI> I an&s;wer, ye mu&s;t know that by the <HI>&s;tate</HI> ye are now in. If ye are yet in your natural &s;tate, ye are children of wrath, and not children of this kingdom: for that &s;tate, to them who live and die in it, i&s;&s;ues in eternal mi&s;ery. If you be brought into the <HI>&s;tate of grace,</HI> you have a ju&s;t claim to the &s;tate of glory; for grace will certainly i&s;&s;ue in glory at length. This kingdom is an <HI>inheritance,</HI> which none but the <HI>children</HI> of God can ju&s;tly claim: now we be|come the children of God, by <HI>regeneration</HI> and <HI>union with Chri&s;t</HI> his Son; <HI>and if children, then heirs, heirs of God, and joint heirs with Chri&s;t,</HI> Rom viii. 17. The&s;e then are the great points, upon which one's evidences for the &s;tate of glory do depend. And therefore I refer you to what is &s;aid on the &s;tate of grace, for clearing of you as to your right to glory.</P>
<P>If you be heirs of glory, <HI>the kingdom of God is within you,</HI> by virtue of your regeneration and union with Chri&s;t. (1.) <HI>The king|dom

of heaven</HI> has the throne in thy heart, if thou ha&s;t a right to that kingdom: Chri&s;t is <HI>in</HI> thee: and God is <HI>in</HI> thee; and having cho&s;en him for thy portion, thy &s;oul has taken up its everla&s;ting re&s;t in him, and gets no kindly re&s;t but in him; as the dove, until &s;he came into the ark. To him the &s;oul habitually inclines, by virtue of the new nature, the divine nature, which the heirs of glory are partakers of, P&s;al lxxiii. 25. "Whom ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e I in heaven but thee." "And there is none upon earth that I de&s;ire be&s;ides thee," (2.) <HI>The laws of hea|ven</HI> are in thy heart, if thou art an heir of heaven, Heb. viii. 10.
<Q>I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts.</Q>
Thy <HI>mind</HI> is <HI>enlightened</HI> in the knowledge of the laws of the king|dom, by the Spirit of the Lord, the in&s;tructor of all the heirs of glory: for whoever may want in&s;truction, &s;ure an heir to a crown &s;hall not want it.
<Q>It is written in the prophets; and they &s;hall all be taught of God.</Q>
John vi. 45. Therefore though father and mother leave them early, or be in no concern about their Chri&s;tian education, and they be &s;oon put to work for their daily bread; yet they &s;hall not lack teaching. Withal thy <HI>heart</HI> is <HI>charged,</HI> and thou beare&s;t God's image, which con&s;i&s;ts in <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s and true holine&s;s,</HI> Eph. iv. 24. Thy &s;oul is reconciled to the whole <HI>law</HI> of God, and at war with all known &s;in. In vain do they pretend to the holy kindgom, who are not holy in heart and life; for <HI>without holine&s;s no man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord,</HI> Heb. xii. 14. If heaven is a re&s;t, it is for &s;piritual labourers, and not for loiterers. If it is an eternal triumph, they are not in the way to it, who avoid the &s;piritual warfare, and are in no care to &s;ubdue corrup|tion, re&s;i&s;t temptation, and to cut their way to it, through the oppo&s;i|tion made by the devil, the world, and the fle&s;h. (3.) <HI>The trea&s;ure in heaven</HI> is the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hief in thy e&s;teem and de&s;ire, for it is <HI>your</HI> trea&s;ure, and <HI>where your trea&s;ure is, there will your heart be al&s;o,</HI> Marth. vi. 21. If it is not the things that are &s;een, but the things that are not &s;een, which thy heart is in greate&s;t care and concern to abtain; if thou art driving a trade with heaven, and thy chief bu&s;ine&s;s lies there; it is a &s;ign thy trea&s;ure is there, for thy heart is there. But if thou art of the&s;e, who wonder why &s;o much ado about heaven and eternal life, as if le&s;s might &s;erve the turn: thou art like to have nothing ado with it at all. Carnal men value them&s;elves mo&s;t on their <HI>trea&s;ures upon earth;</HI> with them, the things that are not &s;een, are weighed down by the things that are &s;een, and no lo&s;&s;es do &s;o much affect them as earthly lo&s;&s;es: but the heirs of the crown of glory will value them&s;elves mo&s;t on their <HI>trea&s;ures in heaven,</HI> and will not put their private e&s;tate in the balance with their kingdom: nor will the lo&s;s of the former go &s;o near their hearts, as the thoughts of the lo&s;s of the latter. Where the&s;e fir&s;t-fruits of heaven are to be found, the eternal weight of glory will &s;urely follow after; while the want of them mu&s;t be admit|ted, according to the word, to be an unconte&s;tible evidence of an heir of wrath.</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="045042_0315_101F807C98528060"><HI>Secondly,</HI> Let the heirs of the kingdom behave them&s;elves &s;uitable to their character and dignity.

This world is but the country, through which lies your road to <HI>Immanuel</HI>'s land; therefore pa&s;s through it as pilgrims and &s;trangers; and dip not into the incumbrances of it, &s;o as to retard you in your journey. It is unworthy of one born to a palace, to &s;et his heart on a cottage, to dwell there: and of one running for a prize of gold, to go off his way, to gather the &s;tones of the brook: but much more is it unworthy of an heir of the kingdom of heaven, to be hid among the &s;tuff of this world, when he &s;hould be going on to rece<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> his crown.

In a common inn, &s;trangers (perhaps) fare better than the children: but here lies the difference, the children are to pay nothing for what they have got; but the &s;trangers get their bill and mu&s;t pay compleatly for all they have had. Did we con&s;ider the wicked's after-reckoning for all the &s;miles of common providence they meet with in the world, we would not grudge them <HI>their good things</HI> here; nor take it ami&s;s that God keeps our be&s;t things la&s;t.

The&s;e riches and honours, profits and plea&s;ures, that mu&s;t be buried with us, and cannot accompany us into another world, are but a wretched portion, and will leave men comfortle&s;s at long run. Ah! why are men &s;o fond, <HI>in their life-time to receive their good things!</HI> why are they not rather in care, to &s;ecure an intere&s;t in the kingdom of heaven, which would never be taken from them, but afford them a portion, to make them happy through the ages of eternity! if you de&s;ire <HI>honour,</HI> there you may have the highe&s;t honour, and which will la&s;t, when the world's honours are laid in the du&s;t; if <HI>riches,</HI> heaven will yield you a trea&s;ure; and, there are <HI>plea&s;ures</HI> for evermore.

(1.) They are <HI>ready</HI> for them, they are not to expect a moment's re&s;pite. The fire is <HI>prepared,</HI> and ready to catch hold of tho&s;e who are thrown into it. (2.) They will have the &s;ociety of <HI>devils</HI> in their torments, being &s;hut up with them in hell. They mu&s;t depart into the &s;ame <HI>fire prepared for</HI> Beelzebub the prince of devils, <HI>and his angels;</HI> namely, other re|probate angels who fell with him, and became devils. It is &s;aid to be prepared <HI>for them;</HI> becau&s;e they &s;inned, and were condemned to hell, before man &s;inned. This &s;peaks further terror to the damned, that they mu&s;t go into the &s;ame torments, and place of torment with the

devil and his angels. They hearkned to his temptations, and they mu&s;t partake in his torments: <HI>his works</HI> they would do, and they mu&s;t re|ceive <HI>the wages,</HI> which is death. In this life they joined with devil in enmity again&s;t God and Chri&s;t, and the way of holine&s;s; and in the other they mu&s;t lodge with them.

<HEAD><HI>DOCTRINE.</HI> The wicked &s;hall be &s;hut up under the cur&s;e of God, in everla&s;ting Mi&s;ery, with the Devils in Hell.</HEAD>
<P>After having evinced that there &s;hall be a <HI>re&s;urrection</HI> of the body, and a general <HI>judgment,</HI> I think it not needful to in&s;i&s;t to prove the truth of future puni&s;hments. The &s;ame con&s;cience there is in men of a future judgment, bears witne&s;s al&s;o of the truth of future puni&s;h|ment. (And that the puni&s;hment of the damned &s;hall not be <HI>annihi|lation,</HI> or a reducing them to nothing, will be clear in the progre&s;s of our di&s;cour&s;e.) In treating of this awful &s;ubject, I &s;hall inquire into the&s;e four things. (1.) The <HI>cur&s;e</HI> under which the damned &s;hall be &s;hut up. (2) Their <HI>mi&s;ery</HI> under that cur&s;e. (3.) Their &s;ociety with devils in this mi&s;erable &s;tate. (4.) The <HI>eternity</HI> of the whole.</P>
<P N="1">I. As to the <HI>cur&s;e</HI> under which the damned &s;hall be &s;hut up in hell; it is the terrible &s;entence of the law, by which they are bound over to the wrath of God, as tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors. This cur&s;e does not fir&s;t &s;eize them, when, &s;tanding before the tribunal, they receive their &s;entence: but they were born under it, they led their life under it in this world, they died under it, ro&s;e with it out of their graves; and the Judge finding it upon them, &s;ends them away with it, into the pit; where it &s;hall ly on them through all the ages of eternity. By nature all men are under the cur&s;e; but it is removed from the elect, by virtue of their union with Chri&s;t. It abides on the re&s;t of &s;inful mankind, and by it they are devoted to de&s;truction, <HI>&s;eparated to evil,</HI> as one may de|&s;cribe the <HI>cur&s;e</HI> from Deut. xxix. 21. <HI>And the Lord &s;hall &s;eparate him unto evil.</HI> Thus &s;hall the damned, for ever, be per&s;ons <HI>devoted to de|&s;truction:</HI> &s;eparate and &s;et apart from among the re&s;t of mankind, unto evil, as ve&s;&s;els of wrath, &s;et up for marks to the arrows of divine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">th; and made the common receptacle and &s;hore of vengeance.</P>
<P>This cur&s;e hath its <HI>fir&s;t fruits</HI> on earth, which are a pledge of the whole <HI>lump</HI> that is to follow. And hence it is, that as temporal and external benefits are bound up together, under the &s;ame expre&s;&s;ions
<PB N="322" REF="045042_0319_101F808A12B34EC8">
in the <HI>promi&s;e</HI> to the Lord's people, as I&s;a xxxv. 10. <HI>And the ran&s;o|med of the Lord &s;hall return, and come to Zion,</HI> &amp;c. relating both to the return from <HI>Babylon,</HI> and to the &s;aints going to their eternal re&s;t in heaven: even &s;o temporal and eternal mi&s;eries, on the enemies of God, are &s;ometimes wrapt up under one and the &s;ame expre&s;&s;ion in the threatning, as I&s;a. xxx. 33.
<Q>For Tophet is ordained of old: yea, for the King it is prepared, he hath made it deep and large; the pile thereof is fire and much wood, the breath of the Lord, like a &s;tream of brim&s;tone, doth kindle it.</Q>
Which relates both to the temporal and eternal de&s;truction of the <HI>A&s;&s;yrians,</HI> who fell by the hand of the angel before <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI> See al&s;o I&s;a lxvi. 24. What is that judicial blindne&s;s to which many are given up <HI>in whom the God of this world hath blinded their eyes,</HI> (2 Cor iv. 4.) but the fir&s;t fruits of hell and of the cur&s;e? Their &s;un is going down at noon day; their dark|ne&s;s increa&s;ing as if it would not &s;top, till it i&s;&s;ue in utter darkne&s;s. Many a la&s;h, in the dark, doth con&s;cience give the wicked, which the world doth not hear of: and what is that, but that the never-dying worm is already begun to gnaw them? And there is not one of the&s;e, but they may call it <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> for <HI>the Lord &s;hall add another;</HI> or rather <HI>God,</HI> for <HI>a troup cometh.</HI> The&s;e drops of wrath are terrible forebod|ings of the full &s;hower which is to follow. Sometimes they are given up to their <HI>vile affections,</HI> that they have no more command over them, Rom. i. 26. So their lu&s;ts grow up more and more towards perfecti|on, if I may &s;o &s;peak. As in heaven grace comes to its perfection, &s;o in hell &s;in arrives at its hige&s;t pitch; and as &s;in is thus advancing upon the man, he is the nearer and the liker to hell. There are three things that have a fearful a&s;pect here. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> When every thing that might do good to mens &s;ouls, is bla&s;ted to them; &s;o that their <HI>ble&s;&s;ings</HI> are <HI>cur&s;ed,</HI> (Mal. ii. 2) &s;ermons, prayers, admonitions, and reproofs, which are powerful towards others, are quite inefficacious to them. 2<HI>dly,</HI> When men go on &s;inning &s;till, in the face of plain rebukes from the Lord, in ordinances and providences: God meets them with rods in the way of their &s;in, as it were &s;triking them back; yet they ru&s;h forward. What can be more like hell, where the Lord is always &s;miting, and the damned always &s;inning again&s;t him? <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> When every thing in one's lot is turned into fuel to one's lu&s;ts. Thus adver|&s;ity and pro&s;perity, poverty and wealth, the want of ordinances and the enjoyment of them, do all but nouri&s;h the corruptions of many. Their vicious &s;tomachs corrupt what&s;oever they receive, and all does but increa&s;e noxious humours.</P>
<P>But the <HI>&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> harve&s;t</HI> follows in that mi&s;ery which they &s;hall for ever ly under in hell; that wrath, which, by virtue of the cur&s;e, &s;hall <HI>come upon them to the uttermo&s;t:</HI> the which is the cur&s;e fully executed. This black cloud opens upon them, and the terrible thunder-bolt &s;trikes them, by that dreadful voice from the throne, <HI>Depart from me, ye cur&s;ed,</HI> &amp;c.

<P><HI>Fir&s;t, The puni&s;hment of lo&s;s,</HI> which the damned &s;hall undergo, is <HI>&s;eparation from the Lord,</HI> as we learn from the text, <HI>Depart from me, ye cur&s;ed.</HI> This will be a &s;tone upon their grave's mouth, as <HI>the talent of lead,</HI> Zech. v. 7, 8. that will hold them down for ever.

They will be <HI>locally &s;epa|rated</HI> from the Man Chri&s;t, and &s;hall never come into the &s;eat of the ble&s;&s;ed, where he appears in his glory, but be ca&s;t out into <HI>utter darkne&s;s,</HI> Matth. xxii. 13. They cannot indeed be <HI>locally &s;eparated</HI> from God, they cannot be in a place where he is not, &s;ince he is, and will be pre&s;ent every-where:
<Q>If I make my bed in hell,</Q>
&s;ays the P&s;almi&s;t, "behold thou art there," P&s;al. cxxxix 8. But they &s;hall be mi&s;erable beyond expre&s;&s;ion, in a <HI>relative &s;eparation</HI> from God. Though he will be pre&s;ent in the very center of their &s;ouls, (if I may &s;o expre&s;s it) while they are wrapt up in fiery flames, in <HI>utter darkne&s;s,</HI> it &s;hall not only be to feed them with the vinegar of his wrath, to entertain them with the emanations of his revenging ju&s;tice; but they &s;hall never ta&s;te more of his goodne&s;s and bounty, nor have the lea&s;t glimp&s;e of hope from him. They will &s;ee his heart to be ab&s;olutely alienated from them, and that it cannot be towards them; but that they are the party again&s;t whom the Lord will have an indignation for ever. They &s;hall be deprived of the glorious pre&s;ence and enjoy|ment of God: they &s;hall have no part in the beati&s;ick vi&s;ion, nor &s;ee any thing in God towards them, but one wave of wrath roll|ing at the back of another. This will bring upon them over|whelming floods of &s;orrows for evermore. They &s;hall never ta&s;te of the rivers of plea&s;ures the &s;aints in heaven enjoy; but &s;hall have an everla&s;ting winter, and a perpetual night, becau&s;e the <HI>Sun of righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> has departed from them, and &s;o they are left in utter darkne&s;s. So great as heaven's happine&s;s is, &s;o great will their lo&s;s be; for they can have none of it for ever.</P>
<P>This &s;eparation of the wicked from God will be, (1.) an <HI>invo|luntary &s;eparation.</HI> Now they depart from him, they will not come to him, though they are called, intreated, and obte&s;ted to

<Q>What is thy beloved more than another beloved?</Q>

(2) It will al&s;o be a <HI>total</HI> and <HI>utter &s;eparation.</HI> Albeit the wicked are in this life &s;eparated from God, yet there is a kind of intercour&s;e betwixt them: he gives them many good gifts, and they give him, at lea&s;t, &s;ome good words: &s;o that the peace is not altogether hopele&s;s. But then there &s;hall be a <HI>total &s;eparation,</HI> the damned being <HI>ca&s;t into utter darkne&s;s,</HI> where there will not be the lea&s;t gleam of light or favour from the Lord; the which will put an end unto all their fair words to him. <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> It &s;hall be <HI>a final &s;eparation:</HI> they will part with him, never more to meet, being &s;hut up under everla&s;ting horror and de&s;pair. The match betwixt Je&s;us Chri&s;t and unbelievers, which has &s;o often been carried forward, and put back again, &s;hall then be broken up for ever: and never &s;hall one me&s;&s;age of favour or good-will go betwixt the parties any more.</P>
<P>This puni&s;hment of <HI>lo&s;s,</HI> in a <HI>total</HI> and <HI>final</HI> &s;eparation from God, is a mi&s;ery beyond what mortals can conceive, and which the dreadful experience of the damned can only &s;ufficiently unfold. But that we may have &s;ome conception of the <HI>horror</HI> of it, let the following things be con&s;idered.</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>&s;t,</HI> God is the chief good, and therefore to be <HI>&s;eparated</HI> from <HI>him,</HI> mu&s;t be the <HI>chief evil.</HI> Our native country, our relations, and our life, are good: and therefore, to be deprived of them, we reckon a great evil: and the better any thing is, &s;o much the greater evil is the lo&s;s of it: wherefore God being the chief good, and no good comparable to him, there can be no lo&s;s &s;o great as the lo&s;s of <HI>God.</HI> The full enjoyment of him is the highe&s;t pinacle of happine&s;s the creature is capable of arriving at: to be fully and finally &s;eparated from him mu&s;t then be the lowe&s;t &s;tep of mi&s;ery which the rational creature mu&s;t be reduced to. To be ca&s;t off by men, by good men, by the be&s;t of men, is heavy: what mu&s;t it then be, to be rejected of God, of goodne&s;s it&s;elf!</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly,</HI> God is the fountain of all goodne&s;s, from which all goodne&s;s flows unto the creatures, and by which it is continued in them, and to them. Whatever goodne&s;s or perfection, natural as well as moral, is in any creature, it is from God, and depends upon him, as the light is from, and depends on the &s;un: for every created being, as &s;uch, is a dependent one. Wherefore a total &s;eparation from God, wherein all comfortable communication betwixt God and a rational creature is ab|&s;olutely blocked up, mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity bring along with it a <HI>total eclip&s;e</HI> of all light of comfort and ea&s;e what&s;oever. If there is but one win|dow, or open place, in a hou&s;e, and that be quite &s;hut up; it is evident

there can be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">thing but darkne&s;s in that hou&s;e. Our Lord tells us, (Matth. xix. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> is none good but one, that is God.</HI> Nothing good or comfortable is <HI>originally</HI> from the creature: whatever good or comfortable thing one finds in one's &s;elf, as health of body, peace of mind; whatever &s;weetne&s;s, re&s;t, plea&s;ure, or delight, one finds in other creatures, as in meat, drink, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and &s;ciences; all the&s;e are but &s;ome faint rays of the divine perfections, communicate from God unto the creature, and depending on a con&s;tant influence from him, for their conver&s;ation, which failing they would immediately be gone; for it is impo&s;&s;ible that any created thing can be to us more or better than what God make it to be. All the rivulets of comfort we drink of, within or without our&s;elves, come from God as their &s;pring head: the cour&s;e of which toward us being &s;topt, of nece&s;&s;ity they mu&s;t all dry up.

Ye will find no pity from any in heaven: neither &s;aints nor angels will pity them whom God has utterly ca&s;t off: none will pity you in hell, where there is no love but lothing; all being lothed of God, lothing him, and lothing one another. This is a day of lo&s;&s;es and fears.

than any fire we on earth are acquainted with; as will appear by the following con&s;iderations.</P>
<P N="1">1. As in heaven grace being brought to its perfection, profit and plea&s;ure do al&s;o arrive at their height there; &s;o &s;in being come to its height in hell, the evil of puni&s;hment doth al&s;o arrive at its <HI>perfection</HI> there.

<P N="2">2. Why are the things of the other world repre&s;ented to us, in an earthly dre&s;s, in the word; but that the weakne&s;s of our capa|cities in &s;uch matters (which the Lord is plea&s;ed to conde&s;cend unto) does require it; it being always &s;uppo&s;ed, that the&s;e things of the other world are in their kind more perfect, than that by which they are repre&s;ented? When heaven is repre&s;ented to us under the notion of a city, with gates of pearl, and the &s;treet of gold; we look not to find gold and pearls there, which are &s;o mightily prized on earth, but &s;omething more excellent than the&s;e fine&s;t and mo&s;t precious things in the world: when therefore we hear of <HI>hell-fire,</HI> it is nece&s;&s;ary we under&s;tand by it &s;omething more vehement, piercing, and tormenting, than any fire ever &s;een by our eyes, And here it is worth con&s;idering, that the torments of hell are held forth under &s;everal other notions than that of <HI>fire</HI> &s;imply: and the rea&s;on of it is plain; namely, that hereby, what of <HI>horror</HI> is wanting in one notion of hell, is &s;upplied by another. Why is heaven's happine&s;s repre&s;ented under the various notions of <HI>a trea&s;ure, a paradi&s;e, a fea&s;t, a re&s;t,</HI> &amp;c. but that there is not one of the&s;e things &s;ufficient to expre&s;s it? Even &s;o hell-torments are repre&s;ented under the notion of fire: which the damned are ca&s;t into. A dreadful repre&s;entation indeed! yet not &s;ufficient to expre&s;s the mi&s;ery of the &s;tate of &s;inners in them. Wherefore we hear al&s;o of <HI>the &s;econd death,</HI> (Rev. xx. 6.) for the damned in hell &s;hall be ever dying: of "the wine-pre&s;s of the wrath of God," (chap. xiv. 19.) wherein they will be
<Q>trodden in anger, trampled in the Lord's fury,</Q>
(I&s;a. lxiii. 3.) pre&s;&s;ed, broken, and brui&s;ed, without end: <HI>the worm that dieth not,</HI> (Mark ix. 44.) which &s;hall eternally gnaw them: <HI>a bottomle&s;s pit,</HI> where they will be ever &s;inking, Rev. xx. 3. It is not &s;imply called <HI>a fire,</HI> but
<Q>the lake of fire and brim&s;tone,</Q>
(ver. 19)
<Q>a lake of fire burning with brim&s;tone,</Q>
(chap xix 20) than which, one can imagine nothing more dreadful.

Our fire cannot affect a &s;pirit, but by way of &s;ympathy with the body, to which it is united; but hell fire will not only pierce into the bodies, but directly into the <HI>&s;ouls</HI> of the damned; for it is <HI>prepared for the devil and his angels,</HI> the&s;e wicked &s;pirits, whom no fire on earth can hurt. <HI>Job</HI> complains heavily under the cha&s;ti&s;e-men: of God's <HI>fatherly</HI> hand, &s;aying, <Q>The arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poi&s;on whereof drinketh up my &s;pirit,</Q>

<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> The <HI>preparation</HI> of this fire evinceth the inexpre&s;&s;ible vehemency and dreadfulne&s;s of it.

So the damned &s;hall find in hell a prepared fire, the like to which was never prepared by human art; it is a fire of God's own preparing, the product of infinite wi&s;dom on a particular de&s;ign, to demon|&s;trate the mo&s;t &s;trict and &s;evere <HI>divine ju&s;tice</HI> again&s;t &s;in; which may &s;ufficiently evidence to us the unconceivable exqui&s;itene&s;s thereof.

<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> If I could, I &s;hould &s;hew <HI>what eternity is,</HI> I mean, the crea|ture's eternity. But who can mea&s;ure the waters of the occean, or who can tell you the days, years, and ages of eternity, which are in|finitely more than the drops of the occean? None can comprehend eternity, but the eternal God. Eternity is an occean, whereof we will never &s;ee the &s;hore; it is a deep, where we can find no bottom; a labyrinth, from whence we cannot extricate our&s;elves, and where we &s;hall ever lo&s;e the door. There are two things one may &s;ay of it, (1.) <HI>It has a beginning.</HI> God's eternity has no beginning, but the creature's eternity has. Sometime there was no lake of fire; and tho&s;e who have been there, for &s;ome thou&s;and of years, were once, in time, as we now are. But (2.) <HI>It &s;hall never have an end.</HI> The fir&s;t who entered into the eternity of woe, is as far from the end of it, as the la&s;t, who &s;hall go thither, will be at his entry. They who have laun|ched out furthe&s;t into that occean, are as far from land, as they were the fir&s;t moment they went into it: and thou&s;ands of ages after this, they will be as far from it as ever: Wherefore, <HI>eternity,</HI> which is be|fore us, is a duration that hath a beginning, but no end. It is a begin|ning without a middle, a beginning without an end. After millions of years pa&s;t in it, &s;till it is <HI>a beginning.</HI> God's wrath in hell, will ever be <HI>the wrath to come.</HI> But there is <HI>no middle</HI> in eternity. When millions of ages are pa&s;t in eternity, what is pa&s;t bears no proportion of what is to come; no not &s;o much as one drop of water, falling from the tip of one's finger, bears to all the waters of the occean. There is <HI>no end</HI> of it&punc; while God is, it &s;hall be. It is an entry without an out-gate, a continual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ages, a gla&s;s always running, which &s;hall never run out.</P>

then the damned mu&s;t <HI>depart,</HI> as <HI>cur&s;ed</HI> ones, into everla&s;ting fire, it is evidence that,</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>&s;t,</HI> The <HI>damned</HI> them&s;elves &s;hall be eternal: they will have a being for ever, and will never be &s;ub&s;tantially de&s;troyed, or annihilated. To what end is the fire eternal; if the&s;e who are ca&s;t into it, be not eter|nally in it! It is plain, the everla&s;ting continuance of the fire, is an aggravation of the mi&s;ery of the damned: but &s;urely, if they be anni|hilated, or &s;ub&s;tantially de&s;troyed, it is all a ca&s;e to them, whether the fire be everla&s;ting, or not. Nay, but they depart into everla&s;ting fire, to be everla&s;tingly puni&s;hed in it; Matth xxv. 46. <HI>They &s;hall go away into everla&s;ting puni&s;hment.</HI> Thus the execution of the &s;entence, is a certain di&s;covery of the meaning of it. <HI>The worm,</HI> that <HI>dieth not,</HI> mu&s;t have a &s;ubject to live in: they, who &s;hall have <HI>no re&s;t, day nor night,</HI> (Rev. xiv. 11.) but &s;hall be <HI>tormented day and night for ever and ever,</HI> (chap. xx. 10) will certainly have a <HI>being</HI> for ever and ever, and not be brought into a &s;tate of eternal re&s;t in annihilation De&s;troy|ed indeed they &s;hall be: but their de&s;truction will be an <HI>everla&s;ting de&s;truction,</HI> (2 The&s;&s;. i 9.) a de&s;truction of their <HI>well-being,</HI> but not of their <HI>being.</HI> What is de&s;troyed, is not therefore annihilated; <HI>Art thou come to de&s;troy us?</HI> &s;aid the devil unto Je&s;us Chri&s;t, Luke iv. 34. Howbeit the devils are afraid of <HI>torment,</HI> not of annihilation, Matth. viii. 29. <HI>Art thou come hither to torment us before the time?</HI> The &s;tate of the damned is indeed a &s;tate of <HI>death:</HI> but &s;uch a death it is, as is oppo&s;ite only to a <HI>happy life;</HI> as is clear from other notions of their &s;tate, which nece&s;&s;arily include an <HI>eternal exi&s;tence,</HI> of which before. As they, who are dead in &s;in, are dead to God and holine&s;s, yet live to &s;in: &s;o dying in hell, they live, but &s;eparated from God, and his <HI>favour,</HI> in which <HI>life</HI> lies, P&s;al. xxx 5. They &s;hall ever be under the pang of death; ever dying, but never dead, or ab&s;olutely void of life. How de&s;irable would &s;uch a death be to them! but it will fly from them for ever. Could each one kill another there or could they, with their own hands, rent them&s;elves into lifele&s;s pieces their mi&s;ery would quickly be at an end: but there they mu&s;t live, who cho&s;ed death and refu&s;ed life; for there death lives, and the end ever begins.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly,</HI> The <HI>cur&s;e</HI> &s;hall fly upon them eternally, as the everla&s;ting chain, to hold them in the everla&s;ting fire; a chain that &s;hall never be loo&s;ed, being fixed for ever about them, by the dreadful &s;entence of the <HI>eternal judgment.</HI> This chain, which &s;purns the united force of devils held fa&s;t by it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s too &s;trong to be broken by men, who being &s;olemnly anathematized, and devoted to de&s;truction, can never be re|covered to any other u&s;e.</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly,</HI> Their <HI>puni&s;hment</HI> &s;hall be eternal; Matth. xxv. 46. <HI>They &s;hall go away into everla&s;ting puni&s;hment.</HI> They will be, for ever, &s;e|parate from God and Chri&s;t, and from the &s;ociety of the holy angels and &s;aints; between whom and them an impa&s;&s;ible gulf will be fixed, Luke xvi. 26. <HI>Between us and you,</HI> (&s;ays <HI>Abraham,</HI> in the parable, to the rich man in hell) <HI>there is a great g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">f fixed, &s;o that they which would

pa&s;s from hence to you, cannot: neither can they pa&s;s to us, that would come from thence.</HI> They &s;hall for ever, have the horrible &s;ociety of the devil and his angels. There will be no change of company for evermore, in that region of darkne&s;s Their torment in the fire will be everla&s;ting: they mu&s;t live for ever in it. Several authors both an|cient and modern, tell us of earthen flax, or <HI>Salamander</HI>'s hair; that cloth made of it, being ca&s;t into the fire, is &s;o far from being burnt or con&s;umed, that it is only made clean thereby, as other things are by wa&s;hing But, however that is, it is certain, the damned &s;hall be <HI>tor|mented for ever and ever</HI> in hell fire, and not &s;ub&s;tantially de&s;troyed, Rev xx. 10. And indeed nothing is annihilated by fire, but only di&s;|&s;olved. Of what nature &s;oever hell-fire is, no que&s;tion, the &s;ame God who kept the bodies of the <HI>three children</HI> from burning in <HI>Nebuchad|nezzar's</HI> fiery furnace, can al&s;o keep the bodies of the damned from any &s;uch di&s;&s;olution by hell-fire, as may infer privation of life.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> Their <HI>knowledge</HI> and <HI>&s;en&s;e</HI> of their mi&s;ery &s;hall be eternal, and they &s;hall a&s;&s;uredly know that it will be eternal. How de&s;irable would it be in them, to have their &s;en&s;es for ever locked up, and to lo&s;e the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of their own mi&s;ery; as one may rationally &s;up|po&s;e it to fare at length with &s;ome, in the puni&s;hment of death inflicted on them on earth, and as it is with &s;ome mad people in their mi&s;erable ca&s;e! but that agrees not with the notion of <HI>torment for ever and ever,</HI> nor <HI>the worm that dieth not.</HI> Nay, they will ever have a lively feel|ing of their mi&s;ery, and &s;tronge&s;t impre&s;&s;ions of the wrath of God again&s;t them. And that dreadful intimation of the eternity of their puni&s;hment, made to them, by the Judge, in their &s;entence, will fix &s;uch impre&s;&s;ions of the <HI>eternity</HI> of their mi&s;erable &s;tate upon their minds, as they will never be able to lay a&s;ide, but will continue with them evermore, to complete their mi&s;ery. This will fill them with <HI>everla&s;ting de&s;pair,</HI> a mo&s;t tormenting pa&s;&s;ion, which will continually rent their hearts, as it were in a thou&s;and pieces. To &s;ee floods of wrath <HI>ever</HI> coming, and <HI>never</HI> to cea&s;e; to be ever in torment, and withal to know there &s;hall <HI>never, never,</HI> be a relea&s;e, will be the cape-&s;tone put on the mi&s;ery of the damned, If <HI>hope deferred, maketh the heart &s;ick,</HI> (Prov xiii. 12.) how killing will be, hope rooted up, &s;lain out|right, and buried for ever out of the creature's &s;ight! this will fill them with hatred and rage again&s;t God, their known irreconcileable enemy; and under it, they will roar for ever like wild bulls in a net, and fill the pit with bla&s;phemies evermore.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> I might here &s;hew the <HI>rea&s;onablene&s;s</HI> of the <HI>eternity</HI> of the puni&s;hment of the damned; but having already &s;poke of it in vindicat|ing the ju&s;tice of God, in his &s;ubjecting men in their natural &s;tate to eternal wrath, I only remind you of three things, (1.) The infinite <HI>dignity</HI> of the party offended by &s;in, requires an infinite <HI>puni&s;hment</HI> to be inflicted for the vindication of his honour: &s;ince the demerit of &s;in ri&s;eth according to the dignity and excellency of the per&s;on again&s;t whom it is committed. The party offended is the great God, the chief
<PB N="341" REF="045042_0338_101F80CB41AF1B48">
good: the offender, a vile worm; in re&s;pect of perfection infinitely di&s;tant from God, to whom he is indebted for all that ever he had, implying any good, or perfection what&s;oever. This then requires an infinite puni&s;hment to be inflicted on the &s;inner, the which, &s;ince it cannot&punc; in him, be infinite in <HI>value,</HI> mu&s;t needs be infinite in <HI>duration,</HI> that is to &s;ay, <HI>eternal.</HI> Sin is a kind of infinite evil, as it wrongs an infinite God; and the gult and defilement thereof is <HI>never</HI> taken away, but endures for ever, unle&s;s the Lord him&s;elf in mercy do remove it God, who is offended, is <HI>eternal,</HI> his being never comes to an end, the &s;inful &s;oul is <HI>immortal,</HI> and the man &s;hall live for ever: the &s;inner being <HI>without &s;trength,</HI> (Rom. v 6.) to expiate his gult, can never put away the offence; therefore it ever remains, unle&s;s the Lord do put it away him|&s;elf, as in the elect, by his Son's blood. Wherefore the party offend|ed, the offender, and the offence, ever remaining, the puni&s;hment cannot but be eternal (2.) The &s;inner <HI>would</HI> have continued the cour&s;e of his provocations again&s;t God, for ever without end, if God had not put a check to it by death As long as they were capable to act again&s;t him, in this world, they did it; and therefore ju&s;tly he will act again&s;t them, while he is; that is, for ever. God who judgeth of the will, intents, and inclinations of the heart may ju&s;tly do again&s;t &s;inners, in puni&s;hing, as they <HI>would</HI> have done again&s;t him, in &s;inning. <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> (though I put not the &s;tre&s;s of the matter here, yet) it is ju&s;t and rea&s;onable the damned &s;uffer eternally, &s;ince they will &s;in eter|nally in hell, <HI>gna&s;hing their teeth</HI> (Matth viii. 12.) under their pain, in rage, envy, and grudge, (compare Acts vii. 54. P&s;al. cxii. 10. Luke xiii. 28.) and <HI>bla&s;pheming God</HI> there, (Rev. xvi. 21.) whither they are <HI>driven away in their wickedne&s;s,</HI> Prov. xiv. 42. That the wicked be puni&s;hed for their wickedne&s;s, is ju&s;t: and it is noways incon&s;i&s;tent with ju&s;tice, that the being of the creature be continued for ever: wherefore, it is ju&s;t, that the damned, continuing wicked eternally, do &s;uffer eternally for their wickedne&s;s. The mi&s;ery, under which they &s;in, can neither free them from the debt of obedience, nor excu&s;e their &s;inning, and make it blamele&s;s. The creature, as a creature, is bound unto obedience to his Creator, and no puni&s;hment, inflicted on him&punc; can free him from it, more than the malefactor's pri&s;ons, irons, whipping, and the like, do &s;et him at liberty, to commit anew the crimes for which he is impri&s;oned, or whipt. Neither can the tor|ments of the damned excu&s;e or make blamele&s;s their horrible &s;inning under them, more than exqui&s;ite pains, inflicted upon men on earth, can excu&s;e their murmuring, fretting, and bla&s;pheming again&s;t God under them: for it is not the wrath of God, but their own wicked nature, that is the true cau&s;e of their &s;inning under it: and &s;o the holy Je&s;us bore the wrath of God, without &s;o much as one unbecom|ing thought of God, and far le&s;s any one unbecoming word.</P>
<P>USE I. Here is <HI>a mea&s;uring reed:</HI> O! that men would apply it. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Apply it to your <HI>time</HI> in this world, and you will find your time to be <HI>very &s;hort.</HI> A pro&s;pect of much time to come, proves the ruin of
<PB N="342" REF="045042_0339_101F80CD18085FD0">
many &s;ouls. Men will be reckoning their time by years, (like that rich man, Luke xii. 19, 20) when it may be, there are not many hours of it to run But reckon as you will, laying your time to the mea&s;uring reed of eternity, you will &s;ee your age is as nothing. What a &s;mall and incon&s;iderable point is &s;ixty, eighty, or a hundred years, in re&s;pect of eternity? Compared with eternity, there is a greater di&s;proportion, than between a hair's breadth and the cir|cumference of the whole earth. Why do we &s;leep then in &s;uch a &s;hort day, while we are in hazard of lo&s;ing re&s;t through the long night of eternity? 2dly, Apply it to your endeavours for &s;alvation, and they will be found very &s;canty. When men are pre&s;&s;ed to diligence in their &s;alvation-work, they are ready to &s;ay, "To what purpo&s;e is this wa&s;te?" Alas! if it were to be judged by our diligence, what is it that we have in view, as to the mo&s;t part of us, no man could thereby conjecture, that we have eternity in view. If we duly con&s;idered eternity, we could not but conclude, that, to leave no means appointed of God une&s;&s;ayed, till we get our &s;alvation &s;ecured; to re|fu&s;e re&s;t or comfort in any thing, till we are &s;heltered under the wings of the Mediator; to pur&s;ue our great intere&s;t with the utmo&s;t vigour, to cut off lu&s;ts dear as right hands and right eyes, to &s;et our faces re&s;olutely again&s;t all difficulties, and fight our way through all the oppo&s;ition made by the devil, the world, and the fle&s;h; are, all of them together, little enough for eternity.</P>
<P>USE II. Here is a balance of the &s;anctuary, by which one may under&s;tand the lightne&s;s of what is fal&s;ly thought weighty; and the weight of &s;ome things, by many reckoned to be very light.</P>
<P>FIRST, Some things &s;eem very weighty, which weighed in this balance, will be found very light. (1.) Weigh the
<Q>world, and all that is in it&punc; the lu&s;t of the fle&s;h, the lu&s;t of the eyes, and the pride of life,</Q>
and the whole will be found light in the balance of eternity. Weigh herein all worldly pro|fits, gains and advantages; and you will quickly &s;ee, that a thou&s;and worlds will not quit the co&s;t of the eternity of woe.
<Q>For what is a man profited, if he &s;hall gain the whole world, and lo&s;e his own &s;oul?</Q>
Matth. xvi. 26. Weigh the plea&s;ures of &s;in, which are but for a &s;ea&s;on, with the fire that is everla&s;ting, and you mu&s;t account your&s;elves fools and madmen, to run the hazard of the one for the other. (2.) Weigh your afflictions in this balance, and you will find the heavie&s;t of them very right, in re&s;pect of the weight of eternal angui&s;h. Impatience under affliction, e&s;pecially when worldly trou|bles do &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">itter mens &s;pirits, that they cannot reli&s;h the glad tidings of the go&s;pel, &s;peaks great regardle&s;sne&s;s of eternity. As a &s;mall and incon&s;iderable lo&s;s will be very little at heart with him, who &s;ees him&s;elf in hazard of lo&s;ing his whole e&s;tate &s;o troubles in the world will appear but light to him, who has a lively view of eternity. Such a one will &s;toop, and take up his cro&s;s, whatever it be, thinking it enough to e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ape eternal d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ath. (3) Weigh the mo&s;t difficult and unea&s;y duties of religion here, and you will no more reckon the yoke of Chri&s;t un&s;upportable. Repentance and bitter mourning for &s;in on earth, are very light in compari&s;on of eternal weeping, wailing, and gna&s;hing of teeth in hell. To wre&s;tle with God in prayer, weeping and mak|ing &s;upplication for the ble&s;&s;ing in time is far ea&s;ier than to ly under the cur&s;e through all eternity. Mor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">fication of the mo&s;t beloved lu&s;t is a light thing in compari&s;on with the &s;econd death in hell LASTLY, Weigh your convictions in this balance O! how heavy do the&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> upon many, till they get them &s;haken off! They are not di&s;po&s;ed to f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> them, bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;trive to get clear of them, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> mig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y burden. But the w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rm of an ill con&s;ci|ence, will neither die nor &s;l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ep in hel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, though <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> it a&s;leep <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">

a time. And certainly it is ea&s;ier to entertain the &s;harpe&s;t convictions in this life, &s;o as they may lead one to Chri&s;t, than to have them fixed for ever in the con&s;cience, while in hell one is totally and finally &s;eparated from him.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, But on the other hand, (1.) Weigh &s;in in this balance; and, though now it &s;eems but a light thing to you, ye will find it a weight &s;uffi|cient to turn up an eternal weight of wrath upon you. Even idle words, vain thoughts, and unprofitable actions, weighed in this ballance, and con|&s;idered as following the &s;inner into eternity, will each of them be heavier than the &s;and of the &s;ea: time idly &s;pent will make a weary eternity. Now is your &s;eed-time; thoughts, words and actions are the &s;eed &s;own; eternity is the harve&s;t: though the &s;eed now lies under the clod, unregarded by mo&s;t men, even the lea&s;t grain &s;hall &s;pring up at length; and the fruit will be ac|cording to the &s;eed, Gal. vi. 8
<Q>For he that &s;oweth to his fle&s;h, &s;hall of the fle&s;h reap corruption (i. e. de&s;truction;) but he that &s;oweth to the Spirit, &s;hall of the Spirit reap life everla&s;ting.</Q>
(2.) Weigh in this balance your time, and opportunities of grace and &s;alvation, and you will find them very weighty. Precious time and &s;ea&s;ons of grace, &s;abbaths, communions, prayers, &s;ermons, and the like, are by many now a-days made light of: but the day is coming, when one of the&s;e will be reckoned more valuable than a thou&s;and worlds, by tho&s;e who now have the lea&s;t value for them. When they are gone for ever, and the lo&s;s cannot be retrieved; the&s;e will &s;ee the worth of them, who will not now &s;ee it.</P>
<P>USE III. and LAST, Be warned and &s;tirred up to flee from the wrath to come. Mind eternity, and clo&s;ely ply the work of your &s;alvation. What are you doing&punc; while you are not &s;o doing? Is heaven a fable, or hell a mere &s;care|crow? Mu&s;t we live eternally, and will we be at no more pains to e&s;cape ever|la&s;ting mi&s;ery? Will faint wi&s;hes take the kingdom of heaven by force? And will &s;uch drow&s;y endeavours, as mo&s;t men &s;ati&s;fy them&s;elves with, be ac|counted flying from the wrath to come? Ye who have already fled to Chri&s;t, up, and be doing: ye have begun the work; go on, loiter not, but
<Q>work out your &s;alvation with fear and trembling,</Q>
Philip. ii 12.
<Q>Fear him which is able to de&s;troy both body and &s;oul in hell,</Q>
Matth. x. 28. Re|member, ye are not yet a&s;cended into heaven: ye are but in your middle &s;tate: The everla&s;ting arms have drawn you out of the gulf of wrath ye were plunged into, in your natural &s;tate; they are &s;till underneath you, that ye can never fall down into it again: neverthele&s;s, ye have not yet got up to the top of the rock; the deep below you is frightful; look at it, and ha&s;ten your a&s;cent. Ye who are yet in your natural &s;tate, lift up your eyes, and take a view of the eternal &s;tate. Ari&s;e, ye profane per&s;ons, ye ignorant ones, ye formal hypocrites, &s;trangers to the power of godline&s;s, flee from the wrath to come. Let not the young adventure to delay a moment longer, nor the old put off this work any more.
<Q>To-day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts;</Q>
le&s;t he &s;wear in his wrath, that ye &s;hall never enter into his re&s;t. It is no time to linger in a &s;tate of &s;in, as in Sodom, when fire and brim&s;tone are coming down on it from the Lord. Take warning in time: they who are in hell, are not troubled with &s;uch warnings; but are inraged again&s;t them&s;elves for that they &s;lighted the warning, when they had it.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider, I pray you, (1.) How unea&s;y it is to ly one whole night or a &s;oft bed, in perfect health, when one very fain would have &s;leep, but cannot get it; &s;leep being departed from him How often will one in that ca&s;e wi&s;h for re&s;t! How full of to&s;&s;ings to and fro! But ah! how dreadful mu&s;t it then be to ly in &s;orrow, wrapt up in &s;corching flames through long eternity, in
<PB N="344" REF="045042_0341_101F80D4E6EB8FE0">
that place where they have no re&s;t day nor night! (2.) How terrib<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> would it be to live under violent pains of the cholic or gravel, for forty or &s;ixty years together, without any intermi&s;&s;ion! Yet that is but a very &s;mall thing in compari&s;on of eternal &s;eparation from God, the worm that never d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and the fire that is never quenched. (3.) Eternity is an awful thought; O long, long, endle&s;s eternity! But will not every moment, in eternity of woe, &s;eem a month, and every hour a year, in that mo&s;t wretched and de&s;perate condition? Hence ever and ever, as it were a double eternity. The &s;ick man in the night, to&s;&s;ing to and fro on his bed, &s;ays, it will never be day, com|plains that his pain ever continues, never, never abates. Are the&s;e petty time-eternities, which men form to them&s;elves, in their own imaginations, &s;o very grievous? Alas! then how grievous, how utterly un&s;upportable mu&s;t real eternity of woe, and all manner of mi&s;eries be! LASTLY, There will be &s;pace enough there, to reflect on all the ills of one's heart and life, which one cannot get time to think of now; and to &s;ee that all that was &s;aid of the impenitent &s;inner's hazard, was true, and that the half was not told. There will be &s;pace enough in eternity to think on delayed repentance, to rue one's fol|lies, when it is too late; and in a &s;tate pa&s;t remedy, to &s;peak forth their fruitle&s;s wi&s;hes:
<Q>O that I had never been born! That the womb had been my grave, and I had never &s;een the &s;un! O that I had taken warning in time, and fled from his wrath, while the door of mercy was &s;tanding open to me! O that I had never heard the go&s;pel, that I had lived in &s;ome cor|ner of the world, where a Saviour and the great &s;alvation were not once named!</Q>
But all in vain. What is done cannot be undone; the opportu|nity is lo&s;t, and can never be retrieved; time is gone, and cannot be recalled. Wherefore improve time, while you have it, and do not wilfully ruin your|&s;elves, by &s;topping your ear to the go&s;pel-call.</P>
<P>And now if ye would be &s;aved from the wrath to come, and never go in|to this place of torment, take no re&s;t in your natural &s;tate; believe the &s;in|fulne&s;s and mi&s;ery of it, and labour to get it out quickly, fleeing unto Je&s;us Chri&s;t by faith. Sin in you is the &s;eed of hell: and, if the guilt and reigning power of it be not removed in time, they will bring you to the &s;econd death in eternity. There is no way to get them removed, but by receiving of Chri&s;t, as he is offered in the go&s;pel, for ju&s;tification and &s;anctification: and he is now offered to you with all his &s;alvation, Rev. xxii. 12.17.
<Q>And behold. I come quickly, and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work &s;hall be. And the Spirit and the bride &s;ay, Come. And let him that heareth, &s;ay, Come. And let him that is a-thri&s;t. Come. And who|&s;oever will, let him take the water of life freely.</Q>
Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the Me|diator of peace, and the Fountain of holine&s;s: he it is who
<Q>delivereth us from the wrath to come.</Q>
<Q>There is no condemnation to them which are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who walk not after the fle&s;h, but after the Spirit,</Q>
Rom. viii 1. And the terrors of hell, as well as the joys of heaven, are &s;et before you, to &s;tirr you up to a cordial receiving of him with all his &s;alvation; and to determine you unto the way of faith and holine&s;s, in which alone you can e&s;cape the everla&s;ting fire. May the Lord him&s;elf make them effectual to that end.</P>
<P>Thus far of Man's ETERNAL STATE; the which, becau&s;e it is eternal, admits no &s;ucceeding one for ever.</P>
