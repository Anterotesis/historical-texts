<Q><P>THE words I would prefix to the following di&s;cour&s;e, as a proper MOTTO, are tho&s;e in&s;pired ones of the apo&s;tle PAUL,</P>

<P>THE honorable judge DUDLEY
<Q>e&s;|teem'd the method of ordination, as practi&s;ed in Scotland, at Gene|va, among the di&s;&s;enters in England, and in the churches in this country, to be &s;afe, &s;criptural and valid.</Q>
And he firm|ly believed,
<Q>that the great head of the church, by his ble&s;&s;ed &s;pirit, had own'd, &s;anctified and ble&s;t the admini&s;tration of go&s;pel ordinances by per&s;ons ordained in this way; and that he would continue &s;o to do to the end of the world.</Q>
It
<PB N="6" REF="009089_0004_10311C45ECF4AEA8">
was accordingly his intention, that the di&s;|cour&s;e at this lecture &s;hould be adapted to the purpo&s;e of "explaining and maintain|ing" this kind of ordination. Not that he que&s;tioned "the validity of what is commonly called epi&s;copal ordination, as performed in the church of England," or had it in his heart to encourage the &s;aying any thing that would in&s;inuate as tho' God had not ble&s;t, and would not go on to ble&s;s, the mini&s;try of tho&s;e who were thus or|dained. Had none of the friends to eccle&s;i|a&s;tical &s;uperiorities, according to the pre&s;ent epi&s;copal form, been le&s;s wanting in candor and charity towards tho&s;e who differ from them, we &s;hould never have heard of this lecture. It took ri&s;e, in the honorable founder's mind, from the narrow principles of tho&s;e anathamati&s;ing zealots, who would confine &s;alvation to their own church, by confining the validity of go&s;pel ordinances to the admini&s;tration of them by per&s;ons, upon whom the hands of a bi&s;hop, in their &s;en&s;e of the word, have been impo&s;ed. And he wi&s;ely ordered the preaching of it in this place, that our &s;ons, who are &s;ent here, from all parts of the land, to be trained up for public &s;ervice, might be under advan|tage to hear and know the rea&s;ons, upon which they may, with all good con&s;cience, join in communion with the&s;e churches,
<PB N="7" REF="009089_0005_10311C48C9635200">
and officiate as pa&s;tors in them, &s;hould they, when fitted for it, be called thereto in the providence of God.</P>
<P>YOU are, by this time, at no lo&s;s to know the de&s;ign of the pre&s;ent di&s;cour&s;e; that it is to vindicate the New-England churches in their method of ordination by pre&s;byters: or, in other words, to a&s;&s;ert and maintain the &s;afety and validity of what is commonly called pre&s;byterian ordination, to the pur|po&s;es of the go&s;pel mini&s;try.</P>
<P>ONLY, before I come to the argument upon this head, it may not be ami&s;s to men|tion a few things, in which we agree with our opponents.</P>
<P>WE agree with them, it is the will of Chri&s;t there &s;hould be officers in his church to preach the word, to admini&s;ter the &s;acra|ments, to exerci&s;e di&s;cipline, and to com|mit the&s;e powers to other faithful men; and that this will of his extends to all ages, till time &s;hall be no more. "Lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the world." Whether it be his will, made known in the new-te&s;tament-revelation, or el&s;e-where, that this work of the &s;acred mini&s;try &s;hould be divided, and differently lodged in the hands of two di&s;tinct orders of men, the
<PB N="8" REF="009089_0006_10311C4D9FDC3830">
one &s;uperior, the other inferior, we &s;hall hear afterwards.</P>
<P>WE agree with them, that none &s;hould take upon them the mini&s;terial office, unle&s;s they are qualified for it conformably to the apo&s;tolic directions in the epi&s;tles to Timo|thy and Titus; and, if they are thus quali|fied, that they have no right to officiate as pa&s;tors in the church of Chri&s;t, till they are called hereto. "No man taketh this ho|nor to him&s;elf, but he that is called of God as was Aaron." This call, in the opinion of the church of England, includes not on|ly an ability given by God for the work of the mini&s;try, but the excitement of an ac|tual readine&s;s in the per&s;ons who have it freely to devote them&s;elves to the go&s;pel &s;ervice. We go farther, and add hereto, the voice of the church. And herein the advantage lies undeniably on our &s;ide, whe|ther an appeal be made to &s;cripture, or pri|mitive antiquity. Even after the di&s;tinction between bi&s;hops and pre&s;byters took place, it was by the &s;uffrage of the people that this or that per&s;on was &s;elected for this or the other cure. In this way, Alexander was cho&s;en bi&s;hop of Jeru&s;alem <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eu&s;eb.

as was al&s;o his &s;ucce&s;&s;or Cornelius <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Cyprian.

Epi&s;. 55.40.</NOTE> that Cyprian was elected bi&s;hop of Carthage. &mdash; But in&s;tead of mi&s;pending the time to prove that which is &s;o well known to all, in any mea&s;ure acquainted with an|tiquity, it may rather be lamented, that the churches of Chri&s;t have &s;o generally had wre&s;ted from them, in one way or another, this invaluable privilege. The people, con|&s;tituting the epi&s;copal church at home, &s;carce know what it is to have pa&s;tors of their own chu&s;ing. And the ca&s;e is much the &s;ame with mo&s;t of the prote&s;tant chur|ches in Europe. The right of nomination is almo&s;t univer&s;ally lodged, not with the people, but with princes or patrons, either clerical or &s;ecular, in con&s;equence whereof their mini&s;ters are not of their own chu&s;ing, but &s;uch as others chu&s;e for them. The New-England churches, ble&s;&s;ed be God, po&s;&s;e&s;s and exerci&s;e the right of electing their pa&s;tors in the mo&s;t ample manner of any in the whole chri&s;tian world. May they ever "&s;tand fa&s;t in this liberty" where|with he who is "head over all things," has "made them free"! And may their glory, in this re&s;pect, be never taken from them!</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="009089_0008_10311C51028CEC70">WE agree with them, that, be&s;ides the call to, their mu&s;t be an inve&s;titure in, the mini&s;terial office, before per&s;ons may, in or|dinary ca&s;es, regularly undertake to do the work that is proper to it: And we are fur|ther agreed, that ordination, meaning here|by impo&s;ition of hands with &s;olemn prayer, is the &s;cripture-mode of this inve&s;titure. By the u&s;e of this rite, with prayer, Paul and Barnabas were &s;eparated to the work to which God had called them. So was Ti|mothy; and &s;o were tho&s;e &s;eperated by him to the like work. And this has been the rite of mini&s;terial inve&s;titure in u&s;e in the church all along from the beginning to this day.</P>
<P>ONLY, let it be remembered here, if, by ordination, our opponents &s;uppo&s;e any moral gift, or &s;piritual power, inherent in the ordainers, is conveyed from them to the per&s;ons upon whom they lay their hands, we beg leave to di&s;&s;ent from them in this: Apprehending, and, as we judge, upon good grounds, that the authority of go&s;pel mini&s;ters comes &s;olely from Chri&s;t; while the ordainers are nothing more than his &s;er|vants in in&s;tating the per&s;ons they ordain in the regular exerci&s;e of this authority. As in the ca&s;e of the mayor of a city, the king&punc; charter of incorporation grants the power;
<PB N="11" REF="009089_0009_10311C53784F8700">
the burge&s;&s;es and recorder only indigitate the proper recipient of it, and put him legally into the execution of his office. So here, Chri&s;t, in the go&s;pel-charter, gives the power to act as his mini&s;ters; it only be|longs to the ordainers to point out the per|&s;ons with whom this power is intru&s;ted, and regularly admit them to the exerci&s;e of it. The ordainers are to be con&s;idered, not as granting this power, but as acting mi|ni&s;terially in introducing capable per&s;ons, according to go&s;pel-order, into the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion and u&s;e of it; the power it&s;elf having already been granted by Chri&s;t, the alone fountain of all power in the church, which is properly jure divino.</P>
<P>IT follows from hence, as we judge, very obviou&s;ly and ju&s;tly, that tho&s;e who are re|gularly ve&s;ted with the mini&s;terial office may fairly claim, and warrantably exerci&s;e, all the power that belongs to it, be the words of their inve&s;titure, or the intention of their ordainers, what they will. For as their office is from Chri&s;t his in&s;tituting will, not the intention or words of their ordain|ers, mu&s;t be the true and only mea&s;ure of their power.</P>
<P>IN fine, we agree with our opponents, that the inve&s;titure by ordination mu&s;t be
<PB N="12" REF="009089_0010_10311C55EC500268">
the act of tho&s;e, and only the&s;e, who are authori&s;ed to perform it. It is not left, in the &s;acred &s;criptures, a work common to all, and that may be done by any; but is the appropriate tru&s;t of &s;ome, in di&s;tinction from others. The brethren may not impo&s;e hands in con&s;ecrations to the go&s;pel-mini|&s;try. Nothing occurs in the new-te&s;tament that can be con&s;trued to countenance &s;uch a practice. The bu&s;ine&s;s belongs to tho&s;e only who are officers in the church of Chri&s;t; tho' not to the&s;e indi&s;criminately. For dea|cons, no more than more brethren, may be allowed to lay on hands in ordination. The go&s;pel officers who may do this are only tho&s;e, who are authori&s;ed hereto; that is to &s;ay, they are only tho&s;e who&s;e office contains in it this, among other mini&s;terial powers.</P>
<P>BUT who are tho&s;e officers? This is the grand que&s;tion: And the true an&s;wer to it will be deci&s;ive in the pre&s;ent di&s;pute.</P>
<P>OUR opponents &s;ay, bi&s;hops, con&s;idered as an order of men di&s;tinct from, and &s;u|perior to, pre&s;byters, are the only church-officers, who are ve&s;ted with a right to ordain.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="009089_0011_10311C595A037068">WE &s;ay, on the contrary, the &s;cripture knows of no &s;uch order of officers in the church; and that go&s;pel-pre&s;byters, or &s;uch mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t as are allowed to have a right to preach the word, and admini&s;ter the &s;acraments, are true &s;cripture bi&s;hops, and cloathed with authority to do every thing that is to be done in the bu&s;ine&s;s of ordination.</P>
<P>AND this is the point I am to make evi|dent to you. In order whereto I might call your attention to tho&s;e various argu|ments which have commonly been made u&s;e of upon like occa&s;ions with this: but, as I am confined within too narrow limits to do them proper ju&s;tice, I &s;hall wholly pa&s;s them over, though they carry in them, as I imagine, conclu&s;ive force, that I may leave room to enlarge on the following con&s;iderations, namely,</P>
<P>THAT the apo&s;tles of Chri&s;t, in &s;ettling the churches, con&s;tituted (be&s;ides the order of deacons) no more than one order of &s;tanding pa&s;tors; That the&s;e pa&s;tors, in their day, were called &s;ometimes bi&s;hops, &s;ometimes pre&s;byters, and promi&s;cuou&s;ly pointed out by either of the&s;e names; and finally, that the&s;e bi&s;hops or pre&s;byters were endowed with all the ordinary powers that
<PB N="14" REF="009089_0012_10311C5BD28FE460">
were to be exerci&s;ed in the church of Chri&s;t, particularly with that of ordination.</P>
<P>THESE premi&s;es will, if &s;et in a ju&s;t point of light, unavoidably ju&s;tify us in concluding, that pre&s;byterian ordination, or, as it might with equal propriety be called, ordination by &s;cripture-bi&s;hops, is &s;afe and valid.</P>
<P>IT &s;carce needs to be previou&s;ly remark'd here, that the apo&s;tles, con&s;idered as &s;uch, were immediately &s;ent by God, and this under the infallible guidance of in&s;piration, to preach the go&s;pel to Gentiles as well as Jews, to gather churches in all parts of the world, and to appoint the officers, both for in&s;truction and government, which were to be perpetuated in them for their edification in faith and holine&s;s, till the time of the appearing of our Saviour to put an end to the pre&s;ent go&s;pel-oeconomy. This being taken for granted, I proceed to &s;ay,</P>
<P>THAT the apo&s;tles, in virtue of this plenitude of power, which they received immediately from Chri&s;t, con&s;tituted no more (be&s;ides the order of deacons, with which we have nothing to do at pre&s;ent) than one order of &s;tanding officers in the go&s;pel-church. It is not my bu&s;ine&s;s, in
<PB N="15" REF="009089_0013_10311C5D5AFD4570">
this part of the di&s;cour&s;e, to &s;ay who the&s;e officers are: This will be done afterwards. At pre&s;ent I am concerned only with the fact it&s;elf; the proof of which is to be fetched from the &s;acred writings. And the proof from hence is as full as could rea&s;on|ably be de&s;ired.</P>
<P>NEITHER Chri&s;t nor his apo&s;tles have any where given in&s;tructions, de&s;criptive of the per&s;ons fit for the work of the mini&s;try, that are adapted to the &s;uppo&s;ition of a dif|ference of order in the pa&s;toral office. Had there been &s;uch a difference, different qua|lifications would have been requi&s;ite to the &s;uitable di&s;charge of the different tru&s;ts ari|&s;ing therefrom; and it might ju&s;tly have been expected, that the &s;criptures would have di&s;tingui&s;hed between the qualificati|ons re&s;pectively proper for the manage|ment of each of the&s;e tru&s;ts. But they no where thus di&s;tingui&s;h. They no where intimate, that &s;uch different endowments were nece&s;&s;ary. Far from this, they have &s;pecified the qualifications of one order of pa&s;tors only; as may be &s;een at large in the epi&s;tles to Timothy and Titus. And what is &s;trange, they have been very particular in di&s;cribing the qua|lifications of this one order, while they are totally &s;ilent with re&s;pect to the other that
<PB N="16" REF="009089_0014_10311C5FD4BC1330">
is pleaded for, tho' that other is &s;aid to be by much the mo&s;t honorable and important of the two.</P>
<P>IN like manner, no rules are any where laid down for the guidance of ordainers in ve&s;ting ordinary mini&s;ters with different degrees of honor and power. They are no where told of the in&s;titution of two di&s;tinct orders of &s;tanding pa&s;tors; they are no where in&s;tructed to exerci&s;e their ordaining right conformably to this di&s;tinction, by placing &s;ome in an higher, others in a lower rank in the church. The &s;acred writings of the apo&s;tles &s;ay nothing to &s;uch a pur|po&s;e as this. On the contrary, they pre&s;ent to our view a very full and explicit directo|ry for the ordination of one order only of &s;tanding pa&s;tors. This we have in the Pauline in&s;truction, referring to the &s;ettle|ment of the churches in Crete. The great apo&s;tle of the Gentiles gives it in charge to Titus, whom he left in this i&s;land with a direct view "to &s;et in order the things that were wanting," to ordain fixed pa&s;tors in the &s;everal churches there. But what pa&s;|tors were they? Of a different rank, &s;ome &s;uperior, others inferior? Not a word leading to &s;uch a tho't is to be found thro'|out his whole epi&s;tle. No; but the pa&s;tors he directs &s;hould be ordained were preci&s;ely
<PB N="17" REF="009089_0015_10311C634BF8FCB8">
of the &s;ame rank or degree: Nor did Titus ordain any other. He could not indeed have done it, unle&s;s he had acted counter to the direction he had received from the in&s;pired Paul.</P>
<P>THE plea here is, Titus was him&s;elf, at this time, the &s;ole bi&s;hop of Crete, and as &s;uch entru&s;ted with the power of ordaining inferior pa&s;tors. But this is a plea that can't be &s;upported upon ju&s;t and &s;olid rea&s;ons; as we &s;hall have occa&s;ion, by and by, to make plain to you. In the mean time, we go on and &s;ay further,</P>
<P>THAT, in the churches &s;ettled in apo&s;|tolic times, no ordinary go&s;pel-mini&s;ters are to be found but of one order only. No o|ther were in Ly&s;tra, Iconium and Anti|och. The apo&s;tle Paul, with Barnabas, con&s;tituted &s;uch pa&s;tors in all the churches in the&s;e places, but no other. Tis &s;aid, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts, xiv. 23.</NOTE> "they ordained elders," officers of one and the &s;ame rank, "in every city." Should the words, <GAP DESC="foreign">, be rendered, not, "when they had ordain|ed them elders in every city"; but, accord|ing to Dr. Hammond's <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vid. Hammond in loc.</NOTE> mind, "when they had ordain'd them elders church by church"; meaning, that a plurality of elders was con&s;tituted in the&s;e churches collectively
<PB N="18" REF="009089_0016_10311C66196C7410">
taken, not that there was this plurality in each individual church: I &s;ay, &s;hould this be allowed to be the &s;en&s;e of the words, it would notwith&s;tanding remain the truth of fact, that one order of officers only was here &s;poken of; which is all I am at pre|&s;ent proving from this text. Tho' I &s;ee not but a plurality of elders might be ordained "from church to church," in one church after another, and &s;o in every church, as well as a &s;ingle one in each church. And this is undoubtedly the true &s;en&s;e of the place, as it be&s;t accords with what was ac|tually done in other churches.</P>
<P>AT Ephe&s;us, as in the place we have ju&s;t been con&s;idering, no pa&s;tors had been &s;ettled but of equal degree. No other are mentioned by the apo&s;tle Paul, when he &s;ent from Miletus to Ephe&s;us to call to him the pa&s;tors of that church. He &s;peaks of them in the &s;tile of elders, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts, 20. 17.</NOTE> evidently de|&s;cribing them as officers of one and the &s;ame rank. Had there been a bi&s;hop in this church, a &s;ingle per&s;on of a &s;uperior or|der, to whom the&s;e elders were in &s;ubjecti|on, 'tis &s;trange he did not &s;end for him like|wi&s;e. Or if, at this time, he had been &s;o far di&s;tant from his cure as not to be with|in call, it is equally &s;trange he &s;hould &s;ay nothing relative to him; e&s;pecially, as he
<PB N="19" REF="009089_0017_10311C679F9B4B18">
was now to take his final leave of this church, <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Acts xx. Ver. 38.</NOTE> "knowing that they &s;hould &s;ee his face no more." This, if ever, was a fit &s;ea&s;on to mind them of their duty to their principal pa&s;tor. And it might the rather have been expected now, as he &s;peaks of it as a thing known to him, "that after his departure, grievous wolves would enter in among them, not &s;paring the flock." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ver. 29.</NOTE> Who &s;o proper to have received in&s;tructions, in this ca&s;e, as the chief &s;hepherd? He tells them al&s;o, "that of their own &s;elves men &s;hould ari&s;e, &s;peaking perver&s;e things to draw away di&s;ciples after them." <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver 3<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"></NOTE> And who &s;o &s;uitable to be charged with the care of with&s;tanding the&s;e men as the bi&s;hop? And yet, the whole care of this church, now the apo&s;tle was going from them to return no more, he devolves on the elders; and this, tho' he knew they would be ex|po&s;ed to hazards, both from within them|&s;elves, and from abroad. This conduct is &s;o unlike to the manner of after times, when bi&s;hops were advanced to &s;uperior dig|nity and power, that it mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed, either that the church of Ephe&s;us had no &s;uch bi&s;hop, or that the apo&s;tle was &s;trange|ly forgetful of him. Ignatius, a primitive father, who lived in this &s;ame century, if his epi&s;tles are genuine, as they are &s;aid to
<PB N="20" REF="009089_0018_10311C6A13D247A0">
be by our opponents, did not treat the bi|&s;hop of this, or any other of the churches he wrote to, with &s;uch neglect. He rather e&s;teemed them officers &s;o highly important as to make obedience to them an article worthy of his inculcation repeated to di&s;gu&s;t. If the apo&s;tle Paul had been of the like &s;pi|rit, he could not have omitted mentioning the bi&s;hop of Ephe&s;us, if there had been one in the church there, in his day.</P>
<P>AT Philippi likewi&s;e there were no fixt pa&s;tors but of one order. Very ob&s;ervable to this purpo&s;e is the in&s;cription of the epi&s;tle to the church there.

And the &s;ame &s;i|lence runs thro' the epi&s;tle it&s;elf. The&s;e pa&s;tors, 'tis true, are called bi&s;hops; but they were bi&s;hops of the &s;ame cla&s;s with the el|der at Ly&s;tra, Iconium, Antioch and E|phe&s;us. To be &s;ure, they were not bi&s;hops in the &s;en&s;e of the church of England; and for this very good rea&s;on, becau&s;e there was a plurality of them in this church at the &s;ame time; which flatly contradicts that e&s;&s;ential article in the epi&s;copal &s;cheme, "one church one bi&s;hop."</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="009089_0019_10311C6D82990DE8">NO pains have been wanting to evade this difficulty. Some, in order to it, have adopted the &s;en&s;e, the counterfeit Ambro&s;e, but the true Hilary, would put upon the in&s;cription, and read it thus, "Paul and Timothy, with the bi&s;hops and deacons, to the &s;aints at Philippi." Should this con|&s;truction be allowed to be ju&s;t it would not &s;olve the difficulty. For it would &s;till remain true, that there was a plurality of bi&s;hops in this church, unle&s;s it &s;hould be &s;aid, that the&s;e were the bi&s;hops, not of the church of Philippi, but of other churches happening to be there at this time; which is a meer random-conjecture, arbitrarily made without the lea&s;t proof. But the con|&s;truction it&s;elf is forc'd, and incapable of being ju&s;tified. Should the in&s;criptions prefixt to the two epi&s;tles to the Corinthians be thus read and interpreted, no epi&s;copa|rian, however zealous, would venture to &s;ay, we &s;hould have the true &s;en&s;e.

This is fairly and freely &s;aid.</P>
<P>I SHALL only add here, the apo&s;tle is as forgetful of the bi&s;hop of this church, as he was of the bi&s;hop of Ephe&s;us; for he takes no notice of any &s;ingle pa&s;tor &s;uperior in rank to the other pa&s;tors. And the &s;ame &s;ilence is ob&s;ervable in Polycarp's epi&s;tle to this church a few years after. Will any pretend, that non-re&s;idency was a common cu&s;tom in tho&s;e primitive times?

<P>THERE is yet further evidence, that pa&s;tors of one order only were &s;ettled in the churches, in the fir&s;t times of the go&s;pel, from the apo&s;tle Peter's fir&s;t epi&s;tle, which he directs to the chri&s;tians <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> "&s;cattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, A&s;ia, and Bythinia."

But, in&s;tead of this, he mentions only &s;uch pa&s;|tors as were of equal rank; and the&s;e, while &s;ilent about others, he is expre&s;s in urging to the faithful di&s;charge of their duty as officers in the church of Chri&s;t.

<P>IT is &s;ufficiently evident, I would hope, from what has been offered, that the apo&s;|tles of our Lord con&s;tituted no more than one order of &s;tanding pa&s;tors in the go&s;pel-church. And &s;o the way is prepared to &s;how,</P>

<P>IT may not be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve here, for the &s;ake of tho&s;e who are &s;o apt, in this di&s;pute, to recur to antiquity, that both the greek and latin fathers, if we may believe

to this, we &s;hall go on to the la&s;t branch of the pre&s;ent argument, and &s;ay,</P>
<P>THAT the&s;e officers of equal rank, who are promi&s;cuou&s;ly called either bi&s;hops or pre&s;byters, were endowed with all the or|dinary powers proper to be exerci&s;ed in the church of Chri&s;t, with that of ordination, as well as tho&s;e of teaching, bapti&s;ing and admini&s;tering the Lord's &s;upper.</P>
<P>THAT they were authori&s;ed to preach and admini&s;ter the &s;acraments, our opponents do freely allow. And from hence it might be con&s;equentially argued, &aacute; fortiori, that they were empowered al&s;o to ordain. For the&s;e are mini&s;terial acts more excellent and important in their nature, than that of or|dination. &mdash; But the limits to which I am confined oblige me to pa&s;s over this argu|ment.</P>
<P>IT is al&s;o allowed, and even in&s;i&s;ted on, by epi&s;copal writers, that the &s;ame per&s;ons who are authori&s;ed to govern, are in like manner, empowered to ordain. Now, it were ea&s;y to &s;how, from the &s;crip|tures, that the former of the&s;e powers was given to pre&s;byters; from whence it might be inferred, that they were ve&s;ted with the latter. But this argument al&s;o I &s;hall di&s;|mi&s;s,
<PB N="30" REF="009089_0028_103119CAD8FF46D8">
that I may have time more fully to lay before you the direct proof we have, that the power of ordination was lodged with ordinary pa&s;tors or pre&s;byters.</P>
<P>AND we prove this from &s;cripture-in&s;tan|ces of this kind of ordination.</P>
<P>IF the &s;acred books of the new-te&s;tament pre&s;ent to our view examples of ordination by pre&s;byters, we &s;hall take it for granted, this will be e&s;teemed a good rea&s;on why we &s;hould think, they were ve&s;ted with ordaining power; and that pre&s;byters now will act warrantably, while they copy after the pattern that is &s;et them in the in&s;pired writings. It only remains therefore to pro|duce the&s;e in&s;tances.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t is that of the &s;eparation of Barnabas and Paul to the work to which God had called them; the account whereof is recorded <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> in the&s;e words, "There were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers.&mdash;As they mini&s;tered to the Lord, and fa&s;ted, the holy Gho&s;t &s;aid, &s;eparate me Barnabas and Paul to the work whereunto I have called them. And when they had fa&s;ted and prayed, and laid hands on them, they &s;ent them away." This is the mo&s;t circum&s;tantial account
<PB N="31" REF="009089_0029_103119CDD84C2378">
given in &s;cripture of an ordination. The per&s;ons ordained were previou&s;ly called of God; they were &s;et apart to the &s;pecial work to which they had been called; all the mini&s;terial acts any where mentioned, in the new-te&s;tament, as accompanying the &s;eparation of per&s;ons to the &s;ervice of the church of Chri&s;t, were performed, impo&s;iti|on of hands, fa&s;ting and prayer; and what is more directly to our purpo&s;e, the ordainers were "the prophets and teachers" of the church at Antioch. The&s;e teachers were its ordinary pa&s;tors, the &s;ame officers that are el&s;ewhere promi&s;cuou&s;ly called bi&s;hops or pre&s;byters. Mo&s;t certainly, they could not be bi&s;hops, in the &s;en&s;e of the church of England, becau&s;e there was a plurality of them in this church. What more can be wanting to make this a compleat in&s;tance in our favor?</P>
<P>THE objections again&s;t it only &s;erve as &s;o many occa&s;ions to place it in a &s;tronger point of light.</P>
<P>'TIS &s;aid, by Turrianus, bi&s;hop Bil&s;on&punc; and &s;ome others, that this &s;eparation of Barnabas and Paul was the act, not of the teachers, but of the prophets (extraordinary officers) who impo&s;ed hands with them. But this is only &s;aid not proved; nor can
<PB N="32" REF="009089_0030_103119CFE9E98DA0">
it be proved. The divine order, "&s;eparate me Barnabas and Paul," was as truly di|rected to the&s;e teachers, as to the prophets; they as certainly laid hands on the&s;e per&s;ons; and prayed over them, in &s;eparating them to their work: and as much is attributed to them, relative to their &s;eparation, as to the prophets. And con&s;equently, if it can be argued, from any thing that is here &s;aid to the&s;e prophets, or that is &s;poken of as done by them, that they were ve&s;ted with the power of ordination; it may, in the &s;ame way, and with equal &s;trength, be argued, that the teachers al&s;o were endowed with the &s;ame power; for there is nothing &s;aid to the prophets, but what is equally &s;aid to the teachers; nor was any thing done by the former but the &s;ame was done by the letter.</P>
<P>IT is pleaded, by the whole body of epi&s;copal writers&punc; that Barnabas and Paul were, before this, commi&s;&s;ioned mini&s;ters of Chri&s;ts and that their pre&s;ent &s;eparation was only to a &s;pecial &s;ervice among the Gentiles. It is acknowledged; but, at the &s;ame time, denied that this makes any real alteration in the ca&s;e. For it is to be re|membered, the thing intended by ordina|tion is not, that the ordainers &s;hould com|mi&s;&s;ion per&s;ons to do the work of the mini|&s;try.
<PB N="33" REF="009089_0031_103119D2E97BF308">
This is done by Chri&s;t. It only be|longs to them to declare who the&s;e per&s;ons are, and &s;eparate them to the work to which Chri&s;t has commi&s;&s;ioned them. They don't make them mini&s;ters; but, being authori&s;ed hereto, give them an authentic character as &s;uch in the eye of the world. They don't confer upon them their authority in the go&s;pel-kingdom; but let them into the exerci&s;e of the authority proper to their of|fice, with the &s;olemnity the &s;cripture e&s;teems regular and decent. And it might &s;eem good to the holy Gho&s;t to order, that Bar|nabas and Paul, tho' before commi&s;&s;ioned and &s;ent by Chri&s;t, &s;hould yet, at this time, be &s;eparated to their work by man, in the common and ordinary way. Neither of them, from any thing &s;aid of the matter in the &s;acred books, appear to have been thus &s;eparated before now; and as they were now &s;eparated to the work to which they had been called by impo&s;ition of hands, with fa&s;ting and prayer, it may with all rea&s;on be affirmed, that this &s;eparation was a true &s;cripture-ordination. All the out|ward actions common to an ordination were performed upon this occa&s;ion, and particularly that of laying on of hands. They were, in a word, &s;eparated to the &s;ervice a&s;&s;igned them in the &s;ame way that Timothy was &s;eparated to the mini&s;terial
<PB N="34" REF="009089_0032_103119D8F7DD6FF8">
work, and afterwards &s;eparated others to it; in the &s;ame way Titus was directed to ordain elders in the churches at Crete; yea, in the &s;ame way they them&s;elves ordained elders at Ly&s;tra, Iconium, and Antioch in Pi&s;idia, and this, while upon the very &s;er|vice they were now &s;eparated to. And why their &s;eparation, at this time, &s;hould not be e&s;teemed as proper a &s;cripture-ordination as their's, which was effected by the per|formance of the &s;ame outward actions, no better rea&s;on can be given, than that it will not fall in with the &s;cheme of our opponents.</P>
<P>IT is further objected, this &s;eparation of Barnabas and Paul was in con&s;equence of an immediate order from the holy Gho&s;t, and therefore a precedent not pleadable but in like circum&s;tances. The an&s;wer is ob|vious. Both Timothy and Titus were im|mediately directed by an apo&s;tle of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, &s;peaking to them under the in&s;pira|tion of the holy Gho&s;t, to ordain pa&s;tors at Ephe&s;us and Crete; and yet, the objectors them&s;elves plead the&s;e in&s;tances in &s;upport of the right of bi&s;hops, in their &s;en&s;e of the word, to ordain; and this, to the exclu&s;ion of pre&s;byters. And if the plea is good on their &s;ide, it is equally &s;o on our's. I would &s;ay further, this objection, in&s;tead of &s;etting a&s;ide the in&s;tance before us as a precedent,
<PB N="35" REF="009089_0033_103119DA84C344D0">
makes it the more &s;trongly valid. For it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed, if ordinary teachers were un&s;uitable church-officers to perform the bu&s;ine&s;s of ordination, that the holy Gho&s;t would have ordered them to do it. And, by his committing this work to them, we have an authentic precept, as well as example, for ordination by common tea|chers, &s;tanding ordinary pa&s;tors of the churches. And let me add here, it is high|ly probable, this direction from the holy Gho&s;t, giving ri&s;e to this in&s;tance of ordi|nation by ordinary teachers, was intended for a precedent to the Gentile churches in all after times. This was the judgment of the learned Dr. Lightfoot.

<P>ANOTHER in&s;tance to our purpo&s;e we have in the ca&s;e of Timothy, who was &s;e|parated to the go&s;pel-mini&s;try with the lay|ing on of the hands of the pre&s;bytery; as is evident from that exhortation of the apo&s;tle Paul addre&s;&s;ed to him, in my text, "Neg|lect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the pre&s;bytery:" The
<PB N="36" REF="009089_0034_103119DC1287E580">
meaning of which words, compared with what is &s;aid upon the matter in 2 Tim. i. 6. may, I think, be fully expre&s;&s;ed in the fol|lowing paraphra&s;e, "Improve the gift of the holy Gho&s;t, which I imparted to you in an extraordinary mea&s;ure, according to the prophe&s;ies which went before concern|ing you, when you was &s;eparated to the work of the mini&s;try with the laying on of the hands of the con&s;i&s;tory of pre&s;byters."</P>
<P>YOU ob&s;erve, I do not interpret the gift here &s;aid to be in Timothy of his office as a mini&s;ter, but of the communication of the holy Gho&s;t, in an extraordinary man|ner qualifying him for it; which appears to me the mo&s;t ea&s;y and natural &s;en&s;e. You ob&s;erve likewi&s;e, I &s;peak of this gift of the holy Gho&s;t as imparted to Timothy, thro' the hands of the apo&s;tle Paul, not the hands of the pre&s;bytery. There is no certain ex|ample of &s;uch a communication to be met with in the new-te&s;tament. Perhaps, the holy Gho&s;t, in the days of the apo&s;tles, was never imparted thro' any hands but tho&s;e of an apo&s;tle. But &s;hould it have been o|therwi&s;e, this was the way of communi|cation in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. For the apo&s;tle Paul expre&s;sly &s;peaks of this gift <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. i. 6.</NOTE> as a gift that was in Timothy "by the putting on of his hands." The&s;e pre&s;byters therefore did
<PB N="37" REF="009089_0035_103119DD9D2BA2D8">
not impo&s;e hands on Timothy with a view to communicate to him this gift. It was imparted wholly thro' the hands of the a|po&s;tle Paul. And yet, the presbytery as certainly impo&s;ed their hands on Timothy as Paul impo&s;ed his. And why? No good rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;igned for it but this, that they might &s;eparate him to the go&s;pel-mi|ni&s;try in the ordinary way, by u&s;ing the &s;cripture-rite common upon &s;uch an occa|&s;ion. And if it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that this gift of the holy Gho&s;t was imparted to Timothy thro' the hands of Paul, about the time that he was &s;eparated to the mini&s;try by the laying on of the hands of the conce&s;&s;us of pre&s;byters, we &s;hall have an ea&s;y and con&s;i&s;tent &s;en&s;e of this whole affair.</P>
<P>THE truth of the ca&s;e &s;eems plainly to be this. The apo&s;tle Paul impo&s;ed his hands on Timothy to communicate to him the gift of the holy Gho&s;t; and either with the apo&s;tle, or, as I rather think, afterwards, the council of pre&s;byters laid on their's, &s;eparating him, by this rite, to his work, as Paul him&s;elf, with Barnabas, &s;ome time before, had been &s;eparated to their's. And very ob&s;ervable, it may be proper to re|mark here, is the analogy between this &s;e|paration of Timothy, and that of Paul and Barnabas. They were &s;eparated by expre&s;s
<PB N="38" REF="009089_0036_103119E0AAA9C0C0">
direction from the holy Gho&s;t; &s;o was Timothy, for he was pointed out by prophecy, that is, by holy men propheti|cally &s;peaking of him by in&s;piration of the holy Gho&s;t, as a fit per&s;on to be employed in the &s;ervice of the go&s;pel. And it was probably owing to this, that he was &s;o &s;oon &s;eparated to this work, being, at this time, a very young man, and in danger, on that account, of being de&s;pi&s;ed. They were &s;eperated al&s;o by the laying on of the hands of the prophets and teachers, that is, the ordinary pa&s;tors of the church at Anti|och; &s;o was Timothy, by the laying on of the hands of the company of pre&s;byters, re&s;iding where he now was.</P>
<P>BUT the pertinency of this in&s;tance will appear with a brighter lu&s;tre, by con&s;ider|ing the objections that are made to it; as, by this means, we &s;hall have an opportuni|ty of going more critically into the exami|nation of it.</P>
<P>IT is objected, the word pre&s;bytery, <GAP DESC="foreign">, here u&s;ed, means the office ordained to, not the con&s;i&s;tory of ordaining pre&s;byters. This was Calvin's interpreta|tion, when he wrote his in&s;titutions <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Says he, "Quod de impo&s;itione manuum pre&s;byterii dicitur, non ita accipio qua&s;i Paulus de &s;eniorum collegio loquatur; &s;ed hoc nomine ordinationem ip&s;am intelligo" &mdash;.</P>

tho' afterwards, in his commentary upon this text, having attained to greater matu|rity of judgment, he fell in with the com|monly received &s;en&s;e <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>"Pre&s;byterium] Qui hic collectivum nomen e&s;&s;e putant, pro collegio pre&s;byterorum po&s;itum, recte &s;entiunt meo judicio."</P> <BIBL>In loc</BIBL></NOTE>.

But this grammatical tran&s;po&s;ition is arbi|trary beyond all rea&s;onable bounds. And &s;hould the like liberty be taken in other ca&s;es, we might make the &s;cripture &s;peak, in any place, ju&s;t what we plea&s;e. Be&s;ides, the word <GAP DESC="foreign"> is never u&s;ed in this &s;en&s;e in the new-te&s;tament; but always as &s;ignifying "conce&s;&s;us, &s;enatus pre&s;bytero+rum."

<P><PB N="40" REF="009089_0038_103119E9438A8650">BUT &s;hould we allow this pretended &s;en&s;e of the word to be the true one, and, in con|&s;equence hereof, that Timothy was ordain|ed, not by an a&s;&s;embly of pre&s;byters, but to the degree of the pre&s;byterate; in&s;tead of helping the cau&s;e of our opponents, it would, unluckily for them, very much &s;erve our's. For Timothy, according to this interpreta|tion, was, at the time, when this epi&s;tle was wrote, nothing more than a pre&s;byter, whatever he might be afterwards: And yet, he is particularly apply'd to, in the epi&s;tle it&s;elf, as one intru&s;ted with the power of ordination, and accordingly in&s;tructed to u&s;e caution and prudence in the management of this tru&s;t, "not &s;uddenly laying hands on any man." And if Timothy, while a meer pre&s;byter, was &s;poken of, by an in&s;pir|ed apo&s;tle, as one ve&s;ted with ordaining power, it is as good a proof of the power we are e&s;tabli&s;hing, as if he was ordained by a con&s;i&s;tory of pre&s;byters.</P>
<P>'TIS again &s;aid, by the pre&s;bytery here is intended, not an a&s;&s;embly of presby|ters, but the college of apo&s;tles. So &s;peak Chry&s;o&s;tom, Theophilus, Theodoret, Oe|cumenius, and after them &s;uch learned men as Dr. Hammond, Mr. Drury, and &s;ome others; but, as we imagine, without any &s;ufficient rea&s;on to &s;upport this &s;en&s;e of the
<PB N="41" REF="009089_0039_103119EC3A2646B8">
word. It is indeed a &s;en&s;e that carries with it not the lea&s;t probability of truth. The apo&s;tle Peter, 'tis true, introduces an ex|hortation to Pre&s;byters, by taking to him|&s;elf the &s;tile of a fellow-pre&s;byter, <GAP DESC="foreign"> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. v. 1.</NOTE>; but the apo&s;tles, in a collective view, are never once &s;poken of, in the new-te&s;tament, as a pre&s;bytery; nor is the word, <GAP DESC="foreign">, ever u&s;ed by any ancient writer (as Mr. Boy&s;e ob&s;erves) to &s;ignify the bench of apo&s;tles. Far from this, when met together in council at Jeru&s;alem, upon a &s;pecial occa&s;ion, with the elders, they are carefully and particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed from them, every time they are mentioned.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts xvth chap.</NOTE> Nor can it well be imagined, if the other apo&s;tles had joined with Paul in laying their hands on Timothy, either for imparting the holy Gho&s;t, or &s;eparating him to the go&s;pel-mini&s;try, that this humble apo&s;tle would have omitted mentioning their names, &s;ince he &s;o expre&s;sly mentions his own. Be&s;ides, there is not the lea&s;t rea&s;on to think, that either all, or mo&s;t, or any con&s;iderable number of the apo&s;tles were together at this time. 'Tis far more likely, from the hi&s;tory we have in the acts of their travels, and di&s;per&s;ions from each other, that Paul only was now pre&s;ent, and that the pre&s;|bytery that laid their hands on Timothy was not the company of apo&s;tles, but &s;uch
<PB N="42" REF="009089_0040_103119F0024C68D0">
presbyters as they had con&s;tituted in the &s;e|veral churches.</P>
<P>BUT &s;hould it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the apo&s;|tles were now together, and that this pre&s;|bytery was the a&s;&s;embly of apo&s;tles, it would be of no real &s;ervice to the epi&s;copal cau&s;e. For 'tis plain, they acted not, in their apo&s;tolical character, but as presbyters. Why el&s;e are they called a presbytery? It cannot rea&s;onably be thought, if the holy Gho&s;t intended to declare, in this text, that Timothy was ordained by apo&s;tolical au|thority, and not that which is ve&s;ted in pre&s;|byters, he would &s;o expre&s;sly have &s;poken of the apo&s;tles as acting in this affair as a presbytery. It &s;hould rather &s;eem evident from hence, that the work they now did was common and ordinary, and &s;uch as might be done by the&s;e officers, under who&s;e &s;tyle they are repre&s;ented as perform|ing this action.</P>
<P>FINALLY, it is pleaded, that Timothy was ve&s;ted with his office by the laying on of the apo&s;tle Paul's hands, while the con|&s;i&s;tory of presbyters, by impo&s;ing their's, only gave their concurring approbation. And for the proof of this we are turned to 2 Tim. i. 6. where Paul, calling upon Ti|mothy "to &s;tir up the gift that was in him,"
<PB N="43" REF="009089_0041_103119F271B95EC0">
adds, "which is in thee by the putting on of my hands."</P>
<P>THE an&s;wer is ea&s;y. This &s;ame apo&s;tle attributes as much to the hands of the pre&s;|bytery in 1 Tim. 4.14. as he does to his own hands in the place referred to in his &s;econd epi&s;tle; and con&s;equently there is ju&s;t the &s;ame rea&s;on to &s;ay, that the pre&s;|bytery ordained Timothy, as that Paul or|dained him. Be&s;ides, it cannot be rea&s;o|nably &s;uppo&s;ed, that an in&s;pired apo&s;tle &s;hould permit a number of presbyters to join with him in the &s;acred &s;olemnity of impo&s;ing hands, if they had not a right, as officers in the church of Chri&s;t, to perform this action; and their performing it is a &s;ure argument of their right to do the thing intended by it, that is, to &s;eparate a per&s;on to the work of the go&s;pel-mini&s;try: As they that have a right to apply water in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the holy Gho&s;t, have a right to bapti&s;e; and they that have a right to &s;et apart bread and wine, and di&s;tribute it to the people, have a right to admini&s;ter the Lord's &s;upper.</P>
<P>BUT the truth of the matter is, it is far from being evident, that Paul impo&s;ed hands with the presbytery in Timothy's ordination; and I am &s;trongly inclined to
<PB N="44" REF="009089_0042_103119F3FA2E7860">
think he did not. The gift the apo&s;tle &s;peaks of, in his &s;econd epi&s;tle to Timothy, which, &s;ays he, "is in thee by the putting on of my hands," was undoubtedly the gift of the holy Gho&s;t in miraculous powers; but whatever the gift was, it was imparted by the apo&s;tle's own hands. Not a word is &s;aid of the presbytery, or any per&s;on whatever, as joining with him, not &s;o much as in a way of concurring approba|tion. Whereas, in the pa&s;&s;age we are now con&s;idering, recorded in the fir&s;t epi&s;tle, the thing that was done, whatever it was, was done with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery. Their hands only are mentioned, not a word is drop'd in&s;inuating that Paul's hands were joined with theirs. It is therefore highly probable, if not cer|tain, that Paul impo&s;ed hands on Timothy to confer the gift of the holy Gho&s;t, which was u&s;ually, if not always, done by &s;ome apo&s;tle in this way; and that the presbytery afterwards laid on their hands for another purpo&s;e, that of &s;eparating him to the work of the mini&s;try, which al&s;o was u&s;ually done in this way.</P>
<P>OR if it &s;hould be &s;till &s;aid, that Paul laid hands on Timothy at the &s;ame time the presbytery impo&s;ed their's, he did it prin|cipally that through his hands, being an apo&s;tle, the holy Gho&s;t might be imparted
<PB N="45" REF="009089_0043_103119F67287CE68">
to him; they, that he might, in the ordi|nary method, be &s;eparated to the go&s;pel-mini&s;try. So that, in either of the&s;e ways, we have an evident in&s;tance of ordination by presbyters. In the former, they were &s;ole ordainers; in the latter, ordainers in partner&s;hip with the apo&s;tle Paul.</P>
<P>I CAN'T help &s;aying here, if, in&s;tead of, "the laying on of the hands of the pre&s;|bytery," it had been wrote, "the lay|ing on of the hands of the epi&s;copate," our opponents would have triumphed in having an unexceptionable in&s;tance of epi&s;copal ordination. But this occa&s;ion of glorying is happily taken away. And it is remarkable, tho' we have examples, in &s;cripture, of ordination by both extraor|dinary and ordinary officers, by apo&s;tles, by prophets, by evangeli&s;ts, by teachers or common pa&s;tors and presbyters; yet we no where read of an ordination by any per&s;on under the name of a bi&s;hop. There is a total &s;ilence throughout the new-te&s;ta|ment upon this head. This ob&s;ervation, to u&s;e the words of your worthy Divinity-profe&s;&s;or, in a book of his, relative to this controver&s;y, wrote near 40 years ago, enti|tled, "&s;ober remarks," and which I would recommend to your diligent peru&s;al, "This ob&s;ervation, &s;ays he, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 115.</NOTE>

&s;ome weak per&s;ons into doubts about the validity of epi&s;copal ordination.&mdash;But the truth of the ca&s;e is, that bi&s;hops and presbyters are one and the &s;ame order by divine in&s;titution; and that they &s;ucceed the apo&s;tles, in all their ordinary powers, of which that of ordination is one; which is warrant enough for ordi|nation by presbyters, and the very &s;ame warrant which tho&s;e have for it, who are now, by cu&s;tom and human con&s;ti|tution, dignified and di&s;tingui&s;hed with the title of bi&s;hops.</Q></P>
<P>I HAVE now con&s;idered the argument at fir&s;t propo&s;ed, in all its parts. And the &s;um of what has been &s;aid, that we may have it in one view, is this; that the apo&s;|tles of Chri&s;t, in con&s;equence of their com|mi&s;&s;ion from him, and as acting under the in&s;piration of the holy Gho&s;t, con&s;tituted and &s;ettled in the church, be&s;ides the order of deacons, no more than one order of fixed pa&s;tors; that they promi&s;cuou&s;ly point out the pa&s;tors of this one order by the names bi&s;hop and presbyter, &s;ometimes u&s;ing the former, &s;ometimes the latter, and meaning by either preci&s;ely the&s;e pa&s;tors of one and the &s;ame order; and finally that they give us abundant rea&s;on to believe, that the&s;e pa&s;tors of this one order were
<PB N="47" REF="009089_0045_103119FC8E2886E8">
endowed particularly with the power of ordination, in&s;tances whereof they have left upon &s;acred record. The conclu&s;ion from which premi&s;es, if they have been clearly and fully evidenced to be true, as I tru&s;t they have, is unque&s;tionably this, that ordination by presbyters, according to the u&s;ual method in the&s;e churches, is &s;afe and valid, becau&s;e agreeable to the holy &s;criptures, and warranted by them.</P>
<P>BUT notwith&s;tanding all that has been offered in proof of the point we have been upon, it ought not, it is acknowledged, to be received as truth, unle&s;s the contrary evidence can fairly be &s;et a&s;ide. This therefore makes it nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ider what is pleaded on the other &s;ide of the que&s;tion. And this I &s;hall now do, giving what is &s;aid its full &s;trength, &s;o far as I am able. For if the counter-evidence, in it's full weight, will not admit of a ju&s;t and &s;olid an&s;wer, we ought, in all rea&s;on, to e&s;teem the above proof to be defective, how plau&s;ible &s;oever it may appear in a &s;eparate view.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t thing &s;aid in favor of the &s;upe|riority of bi&s;hops to presbyters, and in vin|dication of their claim to the powers of ordination and government is, that they
<PB N="48" REF="009089_0046_103119FE44B2C628">
are &s;ucce&s;&s;ors to the apo&s;tles, and derive from them this &s;uperiority of order and power.</P>
<P>THE an&s;wer is ready. The apo&s;tles, as &s;uch, were extraordinary officers, and had no &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. They received their commi&s;&s;ion immediately from Chri&s;t, their charge was unlimited, their province the whole world. They were, by office, the teachers of all nations, had power to gather churches every where, to &s;ettle them with proper officers, to in&s;pect over them, and give binding rules and orders for the good government of them; and all this, under the infallible guidance of the holy Gho&s;t. It will not be pretended, I tru&s;t, that bi|&s;hops, in the&s;e re&s;pects, are &s;ucce&s;&s;ors to the apo&s;tles. In their proper apo&s;tolic cha|racter, they were far exalted above all bi|&s;hops. As the great Dr. Barrow expre&s;&s;es it, (to adapt his words to the pre&s;ent ca&s;e)
<Q>It would be a di&s;paragement to an apo&s;|tle to take upon him the bi&s;hoprick of Rome; as it would be to the king, to become mayor of London; or to the bi|&s;hop of London, to become vicar of Pan|cra&s;s.</Q>
The apo&s;tolic office, as &s;uch, was per&s;onal and temporary; not &s;ucce&s;|&s;ive and communicable: Neither did the apo&s;tles communicate it. Tho&s;e parts in|deed
<PB N="49" REF="009089_0047_103119FFCAD3ED48">
of their office which were ordinary, and intended for perpetual u&s;e, &s;uch as feeding the church of God with the word and &s;acraments, and re&s;training them within the rules of good order, were communica|ted from them to others. We have accor|dingly &s;een, that they appointed &s;tanding pa&s;tors in the churches, ve&s;ting them with all the powers proper for the work of the mini&s;try, for the edifying the body of Chri&s;t. And in a lax &s;en&s;e, the&s;e may be called &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors to the apo&s;tles, as having derived their power from them in Chri&s;t's name. And in this loo&s;e &s;en&s;e only may bi&s;hops be &s;aid to be &s;ucce&s;&s;ors to the apo&s;tles. They certainly do not &s;ucceed them in their office, con&s;idered as apo&s;tolic; but in &s;uch powers of it only as are ordinary and communica|ble. And here they are perfectly upon a par with common pa&s;tors or pre&s;byters, unle&s;s it can be proved, that the apo&s;tles in communicating the&s;e powers, made a dif|ference, committing &s;ome to a &s;uperior or|der called bi&s;hops, and others to an inferior one de&s;cribed by the name of pre&s;byters. This is what we may rea&s;onably expect to &s;ee evidenced. The new-te&s;tament is o|pen. If it contains any &s;uch evidence, let it be produced. We imagine it contains clear evidence of the contrary, and that we have given &s;uch evidence. Meerly the cal|ling

bi&s;hops &s;ucce&s;&s;ors to the apo&s;tles won't prove their &s;uperiority; tho', by the way, they are never &s;o called in the &s;acred books. And &s;hould it be allowed, that the fathers, in after times, &s;peak of them in this &s;tile, it can be in a loo&s;e &s;en&s;e only; meaning, that apo&s;tolic power had been communica|ted to them, tho' what that power was, can never be determined meerly by their being called the apo&s;tles &s;ucce&s;&s;ors.

<P>IT is further &s;aid, in defence of the epi&s;|copal &s;cheme, that Timothy and Titus were bi&s;hops, the one of Ephe&s;us, the other of Crete, meaning hereby officers of a rank &s;uperior to the other pa&s;tors of the churches in tho&s;e places, with whom, as &s;uch, were lodged the powers of ordination and juri&s;|diction.</P>
<P>'TIS reply'd, they are neither of them called bi&s;hops any where in the new-te&s;ta|ment. This name, 'tis true, is given them in the po&s;t&s;cripts to the epi&s;tles that are di|rected to them.

the one of Ephe&s;us, the other of Crete, by the fathers; but not by the more primitive ones.

And the &s;uffrage of the&s;e cen|turies is the le&s;s to be regarded, in this par|ticular, becau&s;e it does not agree with the &s;cripture-account of Timothy and Titus. Timothy is expre&s;sly called "an evangeli&s;t," 2 Tim. iv. 6. And his work, as &s;uch, was in|con&s;i&s;tent with his being the bi&s;hop of Ephe|&s;us, or any other church. The bu&s;ine&s;s of

an evangeli&s;t, as Eu&s;ebius <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lib. III. cap. 37.</NOTE> ju&s;tly repre&s;ents it, was,
<Q>to lay the foundation of faith in &s;trange nations, to con&s;titute them pa&s;tors; and, having committed to them the cul|tivating tho&s;e new plantations, to pa&s;s on to other countries and nations.</Q>
And this de&s;cription of evangeli&s;ts perfectly a|grees with what the &s;cripture &s;ays both of Timothy and Titus. They evidently ap|pear to have been itinerant mi&s;&s;ionaries, not &s;ettled pa&s;tors. To be &s;ure, they &s;u&s;tained no fixed relation to the churches of Ephe&s;us and Crete, and con&s;equently were not the bi&s;hops of them; for they continually went about from place to place, as the &s;ervice of the churches made it nece&s;&s;ary, and were as long, and it may be longer, in other churches than tho&s;e that are &s;aid to be their &s;ettled charge. And would any man, as Mr. Boy&s;e expre&s;&s;es it,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">"Account of the ancient epi&s;copacy," page 331.</NOTE> "call him the fixt bi&s;hop of London that &s;hould only perform the epi&s;copal functions there for a year or two, but for twenty or thirty years is found to perform the &s;ame epi&s;copal functions in mo&s;t other dioce&s;es of England, nay in ma|ny dioce&s;es in France, Spain and Italy?" Can &s;uch an itinerary mini&s;try as this con|&s;i&s;t with a man's fixt relation to a particu|lar church, which enjoys no more of his labors and care than twenty or thirty churches more?</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="009089_0051_10311A0C74C5CBD0">BUT the &s;trength of the argument from Timothy and Titus chiefly lies in this, that they were charged with the management of ordination at Ephe&s;us and Crete. Titus particularly was left in Crete with a profe&s;|&s;ed view to his ordaining elders in the cities there. The an&s;wer is, it will not from hence follow, that they were ve&s;ted with an exclu&s;ive power of ordination. I argue upon the matter thus; either elders had been &s;ettled before this in the churches at Ephe&s;us and Crete, or they had not; and whether our opponents proceed upon the former, or latter of the&s;e &s;uppo&s;itions, their rea&s;oning is inconclu&s;ive.</P>
<P>IF elders had been &s;ettled in the&s;e chur|ches, the con&s;equence is far from being ju&s;t, Timothy and Titus were particularly en|tru&s;ted with the affair of ordination in the&s;e churches, therefore the power was in them exclu&s;ive of the &s;tanding pa&s;tors. By this way of arguing, they mu&s;t have been &s;ole preachers, as well as ordainers; for they are as particularly charged to do the work of preaching, as that of ordaining. And by this &s;ame method of rea&s;oning, the church of Rome mu&s;t be ju&s;tified in their plea for Peter's &s;upremacy; for there are not wanting texts of &s;cripture, in which he is particularly apply'd to, and charged with
<PB N="54" REF="009089_0052_10311A102C81FF48">
in&s;tructions and orders without mentioning the other apo&s;tles. The plain truth is, as the&s;e evangeli&s;ts were a&s;&s;i&s;tants to the a|po&s;tles, and left in tho&s;e churches extraor|dinarily qualified to &s;upply their place, it was proper they &s;hould have particularly committed to them the chief management of ordination, and all other affairs pertain|ing to the kingdom of Chri&s;t, while they continued among them. But how does this prove, that, when they were gone, as was &s;oon the ca&s;e, this &s;ame work might not be done by the &s;tanding pa&s;tors? Or that the &s;tanding pa&s;tors might not, or that they did not, join with them in doing it, while they were actually pre&s;ent? 'Tis far more probable that they did, than that they did not. Timothy's ordination by the con&s;i&s;tory of presbyters would natural|ly put him upon going into the like prac|tice. To be &s;ure, &s;ome po&s;itive good evi|dence ought to be given, that he did not, and that the power of ordination was &s;olely and exclu&s;ively ve&s;ted in him.</P>
<P>THE other &s;uppo&s;ition was that of there being no &s;ettled pa&s;tors in the&s;e churches, when the&s;e in&s;tructions were given to Ti|mothy and Titus. And in this view of the fact, I &s;ee not but the di&s;pute mu&s;t be at <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> ended; for their being directed to or|dain
<PB N="55" REF="009089_0053_10311A11B1FDDDE8">
pa&s;tors in churches that as yet had none, can't po&s;&s;ibly prove, that the&s;e pa&s;|tors, when ordained, might not ordain o|thers al&s;o. And perhaps this is the real truth of the ca&s;e. I am well a&s;&s;ured, it will be found, upon trial, to be an in&s;upe|rable ta&s;k to make it appear, that either of the&s;e churches, at this time, were &s;ettled with pa&s;tors. They were, mo&s;t probably, in the &s;ame imperfect &s;tate with the chur|ches of Ly&s;tra, Iconium, and Antioch, be|fore Barnabas and Paul, upon their return to them, ordained them elders. And, it may be, as Dr. Ben&s;on well ob&s;erves, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">E&s;&s;ay at the end of his paraphra&s;e and note on the epi&s;tle of Paul to Timothy, page 8<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> mo&s;t of the churches the apo&s;tle Paul writes to were in the &s;ame imperfect un&s;ettled &s;tate, at the time when he wrote to them.</P>
<P>I SHALL only add here, as Timothy and Titus were evangeli&s;ts, they had no &s;ucce&s;|&s;ors; or if they had, fixed bi&s;hops could not be their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. Nor will it follow, be|cau&s;e the&s;e evangeli&s;ts were left at Ephe&s;us and Crete to manage the affair of ordination, that therefore bi&s;hops, any more than pre&s;|byters, have this power. It mu&s;t fir&s;t be proved, and upon the foot of good evidence, that bi&s;hops, meaning hereby officers in the church &s;uperior to presbyters, were fix|ed
<PB N="56" REF="009089_0054_10311A148280ABB8">
in tho&s;e places, and that the ordaining power was lodged with them, to the exclu|&s;ion of presbyters; which has never yet been done, and I am fully per&s;uaded never will.</P>
<P>IT is pleaded yet further, that the angels of the &s;even A&s;ian churches, in the book of the Revelation, were bi&s;hops; that is, &s;uch bi&s;hops as the pre&s;ent argument is con|cerned with, or they are mentioned to no purpo&s;e. But how does it appear, that the&s;e angels were bi&s;hops in this &s;en&s;e? If the word is here u&s;ed collectively, meaning the pa&s;tors of the&s;e churches, and not a &s;ingle one in each church, the argument is at once &s;uper&s;eded. And it ought to be thus under&s;tood. Such an expo&s;ition be&s;t agrees with the manner of &s;peaking thro'|out this whole book, in which like words are commonly u&s;ed in this collective &s;en&s;e. Nor, unle&s;s the word is thus interpreted, will the other pa&s;tors of the&s;e churches have any concern in the me&s;&s;ages that are &s;ent to the churches, which it would be highly unrea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e. But, if every one of the&s;e angels &s;hould be allowed to mean a &s;ingle per&s;on, how will it follow here|from, that they were bi&s;hops ve&s;ted with the &s;ole power of ordination and govern|ment in the&s;e churches? The word angel
<PB N="57" REF="009089_0055_10311A170126EC00">
carries in it's meaning nothing that im|ports this; nor is there any thing &s;aid, in the epi&s;tles them&s;elves, from whence it can be deduced. The argument therefore mu&s;t be wholly grounded on this, that the&s;e an|gels are &s;ingled out, and particularly wrote to. But this they might be, &s;uppo&s;ing there was no greater di&s;tinction between them and the other pa&s;tors, than between Peter and the other apo&s;tles; between rec|tors and curates; between an a&s;&s;embly of equal mini&s;ters and their prae&s;es. In &s;hort, it mu&s;t be proved by other evidence than what is contained in the word angel, or the application of this word to a &s;ingle per&s;on, if proved at all, that bi&s;hops were hereby intended, meaning by bi&s;hops of|ficers in the&s;e churches endowed with the &s;ole power of ordination and govern|ment; which evidence has never yet been produced.</P>
<P>THE la&s;t plea, and that which is trium|phed in as deci&s;ive, is the &s;uffrage of all antiquity in favor of bi&s;hops, as an order of men in the church &s;uperior to presbyters, to whom belonged the powers of ordina|tion and government.</P>
<P>BUT, before I come to this plea, it may be proper ju&s;t to ob&s;erve, that we are now
<PB N="58" REF="009089_0056_10311A1A6D686F78">
di&s;puting again&s;t the epi&s;copal &s;cheme, and particularly that branch of it, the confining ordination to bi&s;hops, not as a meer eccle|&s;ia&s;tical appointment, a prudential expe|dient; but as an in&s;titution of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and an in&s;titution of his e&s;&s;entially connec|ted with the validity of go&s;pel-admini&s;tra|tions. And in this view of the matter, the demand, we imagine, is highly rea&s;onable, "what &s;aith the &s;cripture?" It is to little purpo&s;e to tell us of the fathers, and that it is uninterruptedly handed down from them as a fact, that bi&s;hops were &s;uperior to pre&s;|byters, and had the &s;ole right of ordination. This cannot make epi&s;copal-ordination ne|ce&s;&s;ary to the validity of go&s;pel-ordinances. It mu&s;t be con&s;tituted nece&s;&s;ary, if &s;o at all, by the revelations of God, and in fair and legible characters too. We may, with all rea&s;on, expect to find both the con&s;titution it&s;elf, and it's nece&s;&s;ity, delivered in the &s;acred books, not by innuendoes, far-fetch'd arguments, or probable conjectures; but with &s;o much po&s;itive clearne&s;s, and expre&s;s affirmation, as to leave no rea&s;onable room for doubt. And there would now be no need of te&s;timonies from the fathers. It would indeed be di&s;honorary to the &s;acred &s;criptures, and a gro&s;s reflection on them as not being a perfect and &s;ufficient rule, if we might not, without traditionary helps from

the elders, depend on them for the e&s;&s;en|tials of &s;alvation. And, con&s;idering the &s;entiments of our Saviour concerning the traditions handed down to the Jews from their elders, this kind of tradition &s;eems to be one of the la&s;t things &s;uitable to be re|curred to, in order to our knowing what is nece&s;&s;arily connected with true chri&s;tia|nity.</P>

So that here are two points to which they bear witne&s;s, that this was the government of the church in their days, and that it was of apo&s;tolical in&s;ti|tution. And in the&s;e there is &s;uch a con|&s;tancy, and unanimity, that even St. Je|rome him&s;elf (who was born near 250 years after the apo&s;tles, and is the chief per&s;on in all that time whom the pre&s;by|terians cite for any purpo&s;e of their's) traces up epi&s;copacy to the very apo&s;tles, and makes it of their in&s;titution; and in the very place where he mo&s;t exalts pre&s;|byters, he excepts ordination as a work always peculiar to bi&s;hops.</Q>

<P>HAD I met with this repre&s;entation of ancient te&s;timony in a declamatory &s;econd|hand writer, who knew little him&s;elf, and only retailed, in a flouri&s;hing manner, what he had heard from this and the other party-zealot, it would not have been &s;urpri&s;ing; but it really was &s;o, to find a truly great and de&s;ervedly renowned author bringing in the ancient fathers, univer&s;ally, unani|mou&s;ly, and con&s;tantly affirming it to be fact, and this in all ages from the apo&s;tles, that "the government of the church was epi&s;copal," and "of apo&s;tolical in&s;titution;" yea, and that it was "of apo&s;tolical in&s;ti|tution too, that one per&s;on &s;hould ordain and govern pre&s;byters within a certain di&s;|trict." One would imagine, from this re|pre&s;entation, that, if the writings of the fathers were con&s;ulted, epi&s;copacy, both the thing, and the divine in&s;titution of it, would &s;o glaringly appear to have been

<P>A DISTINCTION ought always to be made between the two fir&s;t centuries, and the &s;ucceeding ones for the difference be|tween the writers in the&s;e centuries, as witne&s;&s;es in the pre&s;ent cau&s;e, is both obviou&s;ly and certainly very great. Per|haps, due attention has not been given to this di&s;tinction by the di&s;putants on either &s;ide of the que&s;tion in debate. Sir Peter King's "account of the primitive church," is, it may be, as impartial an one as any extant; but it would, as I apprehend, have been le&s;s faulty, and more perfect, if he had kept in his eye this di&s;tinction thro' the whole of his work. Nor have any of the writers on our &s;ide of the di&s;pute, &s;o far as I have had opportunity to read them, ma|naged the cau&s;e with the advantage they might have done, if they had particularly pointed out the difference between the two fir&s;t and following centuries, and made the u&s;e of it they might have done to their purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="009089_0062_10311A29626FEB00">IT is readily acknowledged, the name bi&s;hop, towards the clo&s;e of the &s;econd cen|tury began to be an appropriated term; &s;ignifying &s;omething more than the word pre&s;byter.

Bi&s;hop and pre&s;byter pointed out officers in the church di&s;tinct from each other; tho' to &s;ay preci&s;ely what, and how great, this di&s;tinction was, will, I believe, be found to be exceeding difficult. It was undoubtedly &s;mall at fir&s;t. The bi&s;hop was no more than "primus interpares," the "head-pre&s;byter," the "prae&s;es" of the con&s;i&s;tory.

<P>IT is indeed beyond di&s;pute, that the e|pi&s;copal form of government was &s;ettled, at the reformation, upon a very different foot from that of a jus divinum. How el&s;e can it be accounted for, that not only in king Henry the eighth's reign, but likewi&s;e in king Edward the &s;ixth's, the bi&s;hops took out commi&s;&s;ions from the crown, by which they were to hold their bi&s;hopricks only during the king's plea&s;ure, and were im|powered

<P>THE truth is, &s;ays Mr. Owen, this notion of the jus divinum of epi&s;copacy, as a &s;u|perior order, was fir&s;t promoted in the church of England by arch-bi&s;hop Land. Dr. Holland, the king's profe&s;&s;or of divinity in Oxon, was much offended with him, for a&s;&s;erting it in a di&s;putation for his de|grees. He checked him publicly, and told him, "he went about to make a divi&s;ion between the Engli&s;h, and the other refor|med churches." <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">"Plea for &s;cripture-ordination," page 115.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="009089_0083_10311A62D4A7B070">AND it was in this archbi&s;hop's time, that the point of re-ordination began to be urged.

But the old church of England did not re|quire or practi&s;e re-ordination. In king Edward the &s;ixth's time, Peter Martyr, Mar|tin Bucer, and P.

Before their con&s;e|cration, Dr. Andrews, bi&s;hop of Ely, moved the que&s;tion, "whether they &s;hould not be fir&s;t epi&s;copally ordained pre&s;byters, that they might be capable of being ad|mitted into the order of bi&s;hops?" Upon which arch-bi&s;hop Bancroft (a mo&s;t rigid a&s;&s;ertor of epi&s;copacy) an&s;wered, "there

was no need of it, &s;ince ordination by pre&s;|byters was valid." The bi&s;hop of Ely yeilded; and without repeating their or|dination as pre&s;byters, they were con&s;ecra|ted bi&s;hops. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pierce's vindication, part I. page 167.</NOTE></P>
<P>HOW far this practice, in the epi&s;copal church, at home, in tho&s;e days, would be countenanced at pre&s;ent, I don't pretend to determine; but thus much has been &s;aid by your highly e&s;teemed divinity-profe&s;&s;or, upon a proper occa&s;ion; who&s;e words are well worth tran&s;cribing here,
<Q>I cannot learn, whether there has been even in England, to this very day, properly any public and expre&s;s a&s;&s;ertion of the "di|vine right" of prelacy, either by parlia|ment, or convocation. I think no &s;uch thing can be found in the thirty-nine ar|ticles, or in the homilies, or in the form of ordination, or in the common prayer-book, &amp;c. Unle&s;s it may be thought con|tained in the preface to the book of ordi|nation, where there is a hint that &s;eems to carry &s;uch an a&s;pect; but, I believe, will appear too &s;lender a foundation to build upon, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e; e&s;pecial|ly if we remember who were the chief compilers of that book; and what rea|&s;on we have to conclude, they were of the judgment, that "prie&s;ts and bi&s;hops
<PB N="87" REF="009089_0085_10311A69B232C4E0">
are, by God's law, one and the &s;ame"; and that the epi&s;copal dignity is rather by cu&s;tom, than by divine in&s;titution.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Sober remarks," page 11.</NOTE></P>
<P>WHAT has been offered will, I believe, be tho't &s;ufficent to make it evident, that ordination by presbyters is no new thing under the &s;un, a &s;ingularity peculiar to the New-England churches; &s;ince we have &s;een it approved by &s;o many of the prote|&s;tant reformed churches, and by the church of England it&s;elf, at lea&s;t in its fir&s;t prote&s;|tant and reformed &s;tate, and for a con&s;idera|ble time afterwards. And had there been an e&s;tabli&s;hment, in tho&s;e days, putting the power of ordination into the hands of pre&s;|byters, it would have been, according to the then general opinion, as agreeable to &s;cripture, as that which put it into the hands of bi&s;hops. Po&s;&s;ibly, the latter would not have been the e&s;tabli&s;hment, had it not been for eccle&s;ia&s;tical dignities and reve|nues; which enter not into the jus divinum of the thing.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX, GIVING a brief hi&s;torical account of the epi&s;tles a&s;cribed to IGNATIUS; and exhibiting &s;ome of the many rea&s;ons, why they ought not to be depended on as his uncorrupted works.</HEAD>
<P>IF we form our judgment of Ignatius from the accounts that are given of him by &s;ome mo|dern authors, we mu&s;t conceive of him as FIRST among the oriental worthies, not only in eccle&s;ia&s;tical dignity, but in piety, learning, and every other endowment, whether natural or &s;piri|tual. And, po&s;&s;ibly, &s;uch &s;entiments concerning him may be ju&s;t; tho' there is no way in which, at pre&s;ent, we can know them to be &s;o. The fa|thers, who lived in the two or three fir&s;t centuries, &s;ay but little about him. They don't &s;o much as tell us, where he was born, how educated, when brought over to the chri&s;tian faith, or by the in&s;tru|mentality of what per&s;ons or means They have indeed left nothing upon record, &s;ave the manner of his going out of the world, from whence his character, as di&s;tingui&s;hed from that of others of the &s;ame age, can be particularly drawn.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="009089_0090_10311A7608413860">HE is &s;poken of, in after-times, as bi&s;hop of Antioch. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">ORIGEN, a writer in the third century, is the fir&s;t that mentions him under this character. He is herein followed by the &s;ucceeding fathers: Tho' they differ in the place they give him in the line of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; &s;ome putting <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">uodius be|fore him, and others Ignatius next to the apo&s;tle Peter, or Paul, or both. This makes a difficulty not unlike to that of Clement's &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the &s;ee of Rome. The epi&s;coparians take different methods to &s;olve it; which it is not my bu&s;ine&s;s, at pre&s;ent, to examine.</NOTE> But it would lead us into wrong tho'ts of this &s;tile, &s;hould we take our idea of it from that &s;uperiority to which bi&s;hops were then exalted. 'Tis probable, the fathers, who call him bi&s;hop, e&s;teemed him &s;uch in the &s;en&s;e the word was under|&s;tood in their day; but as the &s;en&s;e of this word was different then from what it was in the age in which Ignatius flouri&s;hed, they might take more into it's meaning, than it at fir&s;t intended. Prime-pa&s;tor, head-pre&s;byter, is the mo&s;t that was meant by his being bi&s;hop of Antioch, at the time when he &s;u&s;tained this relation to that church.</P>
<P>IF there is no room to que&s;tion his dying a mar|tyr, the manner and circum&s;tances of the fact, as they are related in "the acts of his martyrdom," may rea&s;onably be di&s;puted. The &s;tory of Trajan's &s;ending him to Rome, after his condemnation at Antioch, that he "might be thrown to wild bea&s;ts," does not &s;eem, however defended with his epi&s;tles, to be any of the mo&s;t probable. "For wherefore &s;hould Ignatius of all others be brought to Rome to &s;uffer, when the "Procon&s;uls," and the "Prae|&s;ides provinciarum," did every where, in time of per&s;ecution, execute their power in puni&s;hing chri|&s;tians at their own tribunals, without &s;ending them
<PB N="93" REF="009089_0091_10311A7900A57378">
&s;o long a journey to Rome, to be martyr'd there. And how came Ignatius to make &s;o many, and &s;uch &s;trange, excur&s;ions as he did, by the &s;tory, if the &s;oldiers that were his guard were &s;o cruel to him, as he complains they were." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Iren." pag. 298.</NOTE></P>
<P>BUT however it might be as to circum&s;tances, the thing it&s;elf, his dying for the &s;ake of Chri&s;t, is not denied; tho' the year of his martyrdom can|not be certainly fix'd. Ba&s;nage ranks it among the ob&s;curities of chronology.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Annal. 107.</NOTE> Bi&s;hop Pear&s;on, bi&s;hop Loyd, Pagi, LeClerc and Fabricius place it A. D. 115 or 116. But Du Pin, Tillemont, and Dr. Cave, in the 10th of Trajan, 107. Perhaps, this la&s;t period is by far the more probable.</P>
<P>AS to the epi&s;tles that have been a&s;cribed to this primitive father, and given ri&s;e to &s;o much di&s;pute in the prote&s;tant world, the mo&s;t perfect account of them, I have been able to collect, is briefly this.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t edition of them came out in the year 1494 or 5; containing only three latin epi&s;tles, one to "the Virgin Mary," the other two to "St. John." A. D. 1497 or 8, Faber Stapulen&s;is publi&s;hed ele|ven more latin epi&s;tles, which were &s;everal times reprinted at Strat&s;burg, and once at Ba&s;il. Cham|perius afterwards impre&s;&s;ed the above three and eleven epi&s;tles, with the addition of another "ad Mariam Ca&s;&s;abolitam." This was done at Cologn in 1536, and made in all fifteen epi&s;tles. They were as yet extant only in latin, and thus they re|mained, in &s;till repeated impre&s;&s;ions, till 1557, when Pacaeus printed them in greek, with the latin tran&s;lation of Perionius. The following year Ge&s;ner
<PB N="94" REF="009089_0092_10311A7D8660C830">
publi&s;hed them in greek likewi&s;e, with the ver&s;ion of Brunnerus. This Ge&s;ner a&s;&s;umed the honor of being the fir&s;t, who had made the&s;e epi&s;tles public in greek. But Pacaeus is allowed, both by DuPin, and bi&s;hop Pear&s;on, to have been the fir&s;t editor of them in this language. [N. B. The&s;e greek editions contain only twelve of the fifteen epi&s;tles.] In the year 1608, the edition of Me&s;traeus came forth; and finally that of Vedelius in 1623, with large commentaries.</P>
<P>THIS was the &s;tate of the "Ignatian epi&s;tles," when arch-bi&s;hop U&s;her fir&s;t &s;aw them. Upon reading them, he took notice, that three ancient Engli&s;h divines <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wodeford, Robert Lincolnien&s;is, and Ti&s;&s;ington. "Hammond's an&s;w. to animadver. on his defence," pag. 5</NOTE> had formerly quoted a pa&s;&s;age from them in the very &s;ame words, in which it had been quoted by Theodoret, which words were not to be found in the pre&s;ent editions, either greek or latin; and from hence he concluded, there mu&s;t be &s;ome manu&s;cript-copy of the&s;e epi&s;tles in England. He made diligent &s;earch, and at length found two copies, one at Cambridge in the library of Caius college, the other in the private library of bi&s;hop Montague; containing an ancient ver&s;ion different from the vulgar. He compared it with the pa&s;&s;ages cited by the fathers, and, finding a good agree|ment between them, tho't fit to put out an edition of "the Ignatian epi&s;tles," from this ver&s;ion; which was printed in 1644. Not long after this, the learned Vo&s;&s;ius found, in the duke of Tu&s;cany's library at Florence, a greek manu&s;cript, containing &s;ix of the&s;e epi&s;tles, &s;uppo&s;ed to be the &s;ame that are mentioned by Eu&s;ebius and Jerom; which,
<PB N="95" REF="009089_0093_10311A80C8CAEA60">
agreeing with arch-bi&s;hop U&s;her's copies, he pub|li&s;hed at Am&s;terdam in 1646, with the addition of a &s;eventh, that to "the Romans," much amended from the latin ver&s;ion. This la&s;t epi&s;tle, in 1684, was publi&s;hed at Paris, by Mr. Ruinart, from a &s;uppo&s;ed uninterpolated copy.</P>
<P>FROM this account of the epi&s;tles that go under the name of Ignatius, 'tis obvious to divide them into three cla&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t contains tho&s;e three that are extant only in latin, in&s;cribed to "the Virgin Mary," and "St. John." But they are of &s;o little impor|tance, that learned men &s;carce think it worth while to be at the pains to prove them &s;purious.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd comprehends the epi&s;tles that are printed in greek, but not mentioned by Eu&s;ebius, or Jerom. And the&s;e are five in number. The fir&s;t, to "Mary Ca&s;&s;abolita;" the &s;econd, to "the inhabitants of Tar&s;us;" the third, to "the Antiochians;" the fourth, to "Hero the deacon of Antioch;" the fifth, to "the Philippians." Bellarmine, Baronius, Pa&s;&s;evin, and a few others, give credit to the&s;e epi&s;tles as the real works of Ig|natius; but they are herein oppo&s;ed by almo&s;t the whole body, e&s;pecially, of prote&s;tant writers, who look upon them to be evidently &s;uppo&s;ititious.</P>
<P>IN the third cla&s;s are compri&s;ed the &s;even epi&s;tles, which are &s;uppo&s;ed to be mentioned by Eu&s;ebius and Jerom; which are as follow. The fir&s;t, to "the Ephe&s;ians; the &s;econd, to "the Magne&s;ians;" the third, to "the Trallians;" the fourth, to
<PB N="96" REF="009089_0094_10311A82516C3098">
"the Romans;" the fifth, to "the Philadelphi|ans"; the &s;ixth, to "the Smyrnaeans"; the &s;eventh, "to Polycarp." It may be ob&s;erved here, arch-bi&s;hop U&s;her, and others after him, reject this la&s;t; looking upon the &s;ix former as the only ones com|memorated by Eu&s;ebius: Tho' there are tho&s;e, on the contrary, who, perhaps not with &s;o much rea|&s;on, conclude he takes notice of the whole &s;even.</P>
<P>AS for the &s;even greek epi&s;tles, in this la&s;t cla&s;s, they may be con&s;idered as extant in the editions of them before, or &s;ince, the days of U&s;her and Vo&s;&s;ius.</P>
<P>IN the former con&s;ideration of them, they are &s;tiled "the larger epi&s;tles," and generally di&s;|carded as unworthy of &s;o primitive a father as Ig|natius. Calvin, the Century-writers, Whittaker, Parker, Scultet, Rivet, and others, always de|clared this to be their opinion of them: Tho' the advocates for prelacy, &s;uch as Whitgift, Bil&s;on, Dounam, Heylyn, Taylor, and others, profe&s;&s;ed a belief of them as truly genuine. And as &s;uch they were, in tho&s;e days, appealed to, in the cau&s;e of epi&s;copacy, with as much zeal and frequency as they have been &s;ince. But the&s;e "larger epi&s;tles" are now, I may &s;ay, univer&s;ally given up as inca|pable of defence. The learned bi&s;hop Pear&s;on freely owns, that they are corrupted and interpo|lated: And tho' he commends the indu&s;try of Vedelius in what he has done to di&s;tingui&s;h between what is genuine, and interpolated, in them; yet he thinks, at the &s;ame time, that he has not &s;ufficiently done it; and, in a word, does not undertake their defence, in the&s;e editions of them.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="009089_0095_10311A854ABAF6A8">THESE epi&s;tles, con&s;idered in the latter view, as publi&s;hed from the "Cantabrigian" and "Flo|rentine" copies, are called the "&s;horter ones," and repre&s;ented by the epi&s;coparians to be the un|corrupted works of Ignatius; and, as &s;uch, we are turned to them, upon all occa&s;ions, as containing full evidence of the &s;uperiority of bi&s;hops to pre&s;|byters in order and power.</P>
<P>UPON which, I can't but put you upon minding the conduct of, at lea&s;t, &s;ome of our opponents. The "larger epi&s;tles" of Ignatius they once ear|ne&s;tly contended for again&s;t all that oppo&s;ed them, and con&s;tantly repaired to them as the great &s;upport of their cau&s;e. But now they are willing to throw them by as u&s;ele&s;s; the "&s;horter editions" of U&s;her and Vo&s;&s;ius being the only ones to be de|pended on. They could not be prevailed with, by any methods of rea&s;oning, to give up Ignatius in the "former editions," till they had got others, from other copies, to &s;upply their place. And now they readily &s;ee the force of the arguments, they before e&s;teemed as nothing better than meer cavils. It certainly looks as tho' they imagined their cau&s;e &s;tood in ab&s;olute need of Ignatius, and were will|ing to part with him in "former editions," only becau&s;e they have others to &s;ub&s;titute in their room, that they can better manage: Nor can one well for|bear thinking, if "other editions," from &s;till other manu&s;cripts, &s;hould come forth, more defen|&s;ible than the&s;e they now have, they would as readily quit "the&s;e," and cry up "them.".</P>
<P>BUT however uncorrupt the "&s;horter Ignatian epi&s;tles" are &s;aid to be, there are &s;ome, and of
<PB N="98" REF="009089_0096_10311A8932BE99C0">
the fir&s;t rank too for learning, who have openly declared their opinion of them as &s;purious; and a &s;till greater number look upon them as interpolated, and to a degree that renders them unfit to be re|paired to, in order to know the mind of the true Ignatius.</P>
<P>THE &s;trange &s;ilence of primitive antiquity con|cerning epi&s;tles under the name of Ignatius is given, by the learned Daille, as a good rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, that he never wrote any. There is no controver&s;y about the fact it&s;elf, namely, that none of the wri|ters, who&s;e works are &s;till remaining, mention e|pi&s;tles wrote by Ignatius, either a le&s;s or greater number, till we come into the fourth century, three only excepted. And 'tis really a di&s;putable point, to &s;ay the lea&s;t, whether any of the&s;e three, all cir|cum&s;tances con&s;idered, are to be looked upon as proper vouchers in the ca&s;e. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Polycarp, Irenaeus, and Origen, are the three fathers, who are &s;aid to mention epi&s;tles wrote by Ignatius. The &s;entence in Polycarp, which takes notice of the&s;e epi&s;tles, is that which concludes his own epi&s;tle. 'Tis an independant paragraph, and may be con&s;idered, either as an original part of the epi&s;tle, or an after-addition without the lea&s;t damage to its connection or &s;en&s;e. In this view of it, Daille and L'arroque look upon it as an interpolation; and for this rea|&s;on, becau&s;e it &s;peaks of Ignatius as yet alive, and not come to his la&s;t &s;ufferings; while, in the ninth &s;ection, he is di|rectly mentioned as dead, and gone to the Lord; which, as they argue, is an incon&s;i&s;tency, it would be a di&s;honor to charge upon Polycarp. So far as I am able to judge, neither bi&s;hop Pear&s;on, nor arch-bi&s;hop Wake have &s;aid that which is &s;ufficient to take off the force of this arguing. As for Ire|naeus, the manner of his introducing what he gives us from Ignatius is this, "quemadmodum quidam de no&s;tris dixit," as one from among us &s;aid; which is as properly applicable to a VERBAL, as WRITTEN &s;aying: For which rea&s;on I can't but think, notwith&s;tanding all that has been offered in favor of this te&s;timony, that Mr. Lardner &s;peaks the exact truth, when he &s;ays, "'Tis di&s;putable, whether he cites a pa&s;&s;age of a WRITING, or only mentions &s;ome WORDS or EX|PRESSIONS of Ignatius, which might be &s;poken by him upon the near view of his martyrdom." The te&s;timonies from Origen (who by the way, was a writer in the third century) are two. The fir&s;t is taken from "the prologue to the com|mentaries on Canticles," that goes under his name. If he was the real author, (which is tho't que&s;tionable) we have it only in the ver&s;ion of Ruffin, who is repre&s;ented as taking a &s;hameful liberty in all his tran&s;lations of Origen, to alter, add or dimini&s;h; in&s;omuch that there is no knowing what is his, and what is Origen's. 'Tis, I conclude, for this rea&s;on, that neither arch bi&s;hop U&s;her nor Dr. Hammond do make u&s;e of this Origenical te&s;timony in the evidence they exhibit in favor of the "Ignatian epi&s;tles." The other te&s;timony is cited from "his homily on Luke." This al&s;o is &s;u&s;pected to be the work of &s;ome latin author; but if Origen really wrote it, 'tis extant only in latin: And if it was tran&s;lated by Jerom, as is pretended, there is no knowing what is truly Origen's. DuPin &s;ays, the ver&s;ions of Jerom are not more exact than Ruffin's. And Ruffin complains of the liberty Jerom took in his tran&s;lations, as Jerom complains, in like manner, of him. And certainly no great credit ought to be given to tran&s;lations which were done with unbounded licence. I may pertinently as here, 'tis a &s;hrewd circum&s;tance, giving rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that Origen never mentioned the "Ignatian epi&s;tles" in his writings that he is &s;ilently pa&s;&s;ed over by Eu&s;ebius. For no one was a greater admirer of Origen, nor was any one more particularly ver&s;ed in his writings. And as he expre&s;sly re|fers to the above pa&s;&s;ages in Polycarp and Irenaeus, 'tis &s;trange he &s;hould take no notice of tho&s;e in Origen, if they had, in his day, been contained in his writings.</NOTE> But &s;hould they be

allowed to be &s;o, 'tis notwith&s;tanding an unaccount|able thing, that, for the full &s;pace of two hundred years, no more notice &s;hould be taken of the wri|tings of this primitive father, if he left any. For let it be con&s;idered,</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="009089_0098_10311A8E92EDA460">IGNATIUS was a per&s;on that lived in the fir&s;t age of chri&s;tianity; was per&s;onally known to, and ac|quainted with, at lea&s;t, &s;ome of the apo&s;tles, and many of tho&s;e who had been conver&s;ant with them; and he was (as is generally &s;uppo&s;ed) fixed, by the apo&s;tle Peter, or Paul, or both, in the pa&s;toral office at Antioch, a noted city in it&s;elf, and the more &s;o on account of its being the place, where believers were fir&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of chri&s;tians. The&s;e are con&s;iderations that open to us &s;o much of the character of this ancient father, as to leave it pa&s;t doubt, that he was not &s;o ob&s;cure a per&s;on as to be unknown in tho&s;e days. Be&s;ides, he was a glorious martyr for the cau&s;e of Chri&s;t; and, if he really wrote the&s;e epi&s;tles, the circum|&s;tances of his martyrdom were more &s;ignally illu&s;|trious, than ever attended any other martyrdom before, or &s;ince, that we have any record of. For he was condemned at Antioch to die at Rome; and, in order to the execution of this &s;entence, was conveyed by a band of &s;oldiers, as a pri&s;oner of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, through all the go&s;peli&s;ed places, that lay between the&s;e two greatly di&s;tant cities. Such circum&s;tances could not well fail of &s;preading his fame, and occa&s;ioning his being univer&s;ally known, and talk'd of, among chri&s;tians. A primitive fa|ther, and fir&s;t-pa&s;tor of one of the mo&s;t celebrated chri&s;tian churches, to be carried, as it were, thro' the world, in bonds for the name of Chri&s;t; &mdash; it could not but be taken notice of, by all the chur|ches, as he pa&s;&s;ed along: Nor is it conceivable, but that his name upon this account, &s;hould be had in remembrance. If he had been an ob&s;cure per&s;on before, the&s;e ob&s;ervables would have "&s;et him on a hill," and put him under an advantage, beyond
<PB N="101" REF="009089_0099_10311A910E9788E0">
any of the fathers of the &s;ame age, of being com|memorated in after-writings. Such are the circum|&s;tances under which we are to conceive of the &s;up|po&s;ed author of the&s;e epi&s;tles.</P>
<P>AND extraordinary ones attend the epi&s;tles them|&s;elves. For they were wrote, if at all wrote by Ignatius, in the capacity of a "pri&s;oner of death," and while actually on his journey to be "devoured by wild bea&s;ts": Nor were they wrote to a parti|cular friend, upon &s;ome private concern; nor yet to here and there an ob&s;cure church, but to as noted ones as had then been formed; and this, if we may credit the epi&s;coparians, upon matters of the greate&s;t importance: Which are con&s;iderations that won't &s;uffer us to think, that "the&s;e epi&s;tles" were ei|ther unknown to the world, or e&s;teemed worthy of no notice. Six epi&s;tles wrote and &s;ent to as many famous churches, by the head-pa&s;tor of Antioch, upon the mo&s;t momentous affairs, and at &s;o &s;olemn a time as that of his being about to die for the &s;ake of Chri&s;t, could not but have occa&s;ioned great talk in the chri&s;tian world; not is there room to doubt, that they would have had a very di&s;tingui&s;hing value put upon them: Nay, they mu&s;t have been e&s;teem|ed the mo&s;t celebrated monuments of all unin&s;pired antiquity, and as &s;uch have been univer&s;ally known and regarded, e&s;pecially by the learned writers in tho&s;e times. And 'tis really a &s;urpri&s;ing thing, that &s;o little re&s;pect &s;hould be paid to them for the full &s;pace of 200 years, after their compo&s;ure; and what makes the matter &s;till more &s;trange is, that the writings of others of the &s;ame age are particu|larly named, or quoted. And why &s;hould the writings of Ignatius, the mo&s;t famous of them all,
<PB N="102" REF="009089_0100_10311A94D1AD3CF0">
be treated with &s;uch unbecoming neglect?&mdash;There is certainly &s;ome rea&s;on, from the&s;e hints, to &s;u&s;pect, whether Ignatius was the real author of the&s;e epi&s;tles.</P>
<P>'TIS urged, if be did not pen them, they were forged before the days of Eu&s;ebius, that is, between the beginning of the &s;econd, and the coming in of the fourth century; which is repre&s;ented as a thing altogether incredible. 'Tis readily acknowledged, this religious knavery was practi&s;ed, if at all, within the time &s;pecified. And I freely own for my&s;elf &s;till further, that I really tho't it an incredible thing, it &s;hould be practi&s;ed within this period, till, by better acquaintance with antiquity, I was fully con|vinced I had been under a great mi&s;take. Perhaps, the knavi&s;h forgeries, within this term, were as numerous as they have ever been &s;ince, in the &s;ame &s;pace of time. Scarce one of the apo&s;tles, or fir&s;t mo&s;t eminent fathers, have e&s;caped being per&s;ona|ted by &s;ome wretched impo&s;tor, in &s;ome piece or other, they have palmed on the world under their name. Nay, our ble&s;&s;ed Lord him&s;elf has been thus ba&s;ely u&s;ed. And there is no one tolerably ver&s;ed in the ancient writings, but knows this to be true. Hege&s;ippus, (contemporary with Ju&s;tin Martyr, who flouri&s;hed about the year 150) di&s;|cour&s;ing of "apocryphal books," &s;ays, at lea&s;t, of &s;ome of them, that they <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eu&s;eb. lib.

I. cap xvii.</NOTE> "the heretics in his day had an innumerable multi|tude of &s;purious and apocryphal books, which they had forged to delude the more weak and ignorant &s;ort of per&s;ons." Origen, Jerom, Epiphanius,
<PB N="103" REF="009089_0101_10311A97A15399D8">
Ambro&s;e, and others, tell us of great numbers of the&s;e books made u&s;e of by the heretics in their times. Of the&s;e books, &s;ome are quite lo&s;t, not &s;o much as the names, or the lea&s;t part of them, remaining. Of others, there are &s;ome few frag|ments in the writings of the fathers, without men|tioning the books from whence they were taken. Of others, there are undoubted fragments, with the names of the books out of which they are cited. Others are &s;till extant, at lea&s;t, in part. The rea|der may &s;ee a &s;urpri&s;ingly large catalogue of the&s;e forged books, in DuPin's "eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory;" and a much larger one &s;till in Mr. Jones's "method of &s;ettling the canon of the new-te&s;tament": From both which authors, he may meet with what will abundantly &s;atisfy him, that they are indeed forge|ries, and were impo&s;ed on the world long before the days of Eu&s;ebius.</P>
<P>AND not only were books forged under the name of in&s;pired per&s;ons, but of &s;ome of the mo&s;t famous primitive fathers. Such are the "Recognitions" fathered on Clement of Rome; the "Clementines," as al&s;o the "Epitome of the Clementine acts of Peter"; not to &s;ay any thing of the pretended "apo&s;tolical con&s;titutions and canons," &s;aid to be penned by Clement. Such are Polycarp's "let|ter to Diony&s;ius the Areopagite," and his "di&s;cour&s;e on St. John's death". The&s;e are all of them evi|dently &s;purious pieces, and mo&s;t of them univer&s;ally owned to be &s;o. And yet, they were forged before the fourth century. So that, be our opinion of the times before Eu&s;ebius as it will, &s;ome there were, even in tho&s;e times, who were both impudent and knavi&s;h enough to be guilty of &s;uch a fraud, as that
<PB N="104" REF="009089_0102_10311A9967EA6240">
we &s;uppo&s;e might have been practi&s;ed, under the name of Ignatius: And the &s;uppo&s;ition of his being thus fraudulently dealt by is &s;o far from being an in|credible thing, that it only adds one to the many religious frauds, which were committed in tho&s;e days, and under the names of much better men than he can be pretended to be.&mdash;</P>
<P>AFTER all, 'tis po&s;&s;ible, I own, Ignatius might be the writer of the&s;e epi&s;tles: Nor will I pretend to determine, that he was not: Tho' I am inclined to think, mo&s;t unprejudiced per&s;ons, from what has been offered, will be di&s;po&s;ed to que&s;tion, whe|ther they are &s;o certainly his, as to leave no rea&s;onable room for, at lea&s;t, &s;ome doubt in the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT &s;hould it be conceded, that the&s;e epi&s;tles were certainly wrote by Ignatius, we &s;hall, notwith|&s;tanding, hope to be excu&s;ed, if we lay no great weight upon what is cited from them; and for this very good rea&s;on, becau&s;e we judge they are &s;o interlarded with corrupt mixtures, as not fairly to exhibit the real &s;entiments of the primitive father, who&s;e name they bear. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">IT &s;hould be remembred here 'tis not only the truth of fact, that Ignatius has been ba&s;ely and fraudulently dealt with, no le&s;s than eight of the fifteen epi&s;tles that bear his name being FORGERIES, and owned to be &s;o; but 'tis fact likewi&s;e, and acknowledged as &s;uch, that the other &s;even, in all the editions of them, before U&s;her and Vo&s;&s;ius, have been so CORRUPTED by &s;ome knavi&s;h interpolator, as that they ought not to be received as his genuine works. We don't argue from hence, that the "later editions" mu&s;t be corrupted al&s;o; but thus much is obviou&s;ly and certainly deducible herefrom, that they MAY be &s;o; that the &s;uppo&s;i|tion is quite ea&s;y and natural, as falling in with what has al|ready been practi&s;ed upon the&s;e epi&s;tles.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="009089_0103_10311A9AF44F0D60">WHAT we have to offer in &s;upport of this judge|ment, takes in &s;o many particulars, that it would require a va&s;t deal more room than can at pre&s;ent be &s;pared to con&s;ider them. I &s;hall therefore wholly pa&s;s them over, and confine my&s;elf to one thing only, viz. what is here &s;aid concerning the officers of the churches he writes to. And I the rather pitch upon this, becau&s;e the di&s;cour&s;e upon this head &s;o runs through all the epi&s;tles, (one only excepted, the epi&s;tle to the "Romans" <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">'TIS ob&s;ervable, this epi&s;tle is the only one that is perfectly u&s;ele&s;s to the epi&s;copal cau&s;e. For it differs from all the re&s;t in this, that it don't once di&s;tingui&s;h bi&s;hops from pre&s;byters; and, if I don't mi&s;remember, the word bi&s;hop is but once u&s;ed throughout the whole epi&s;tle.</NOTE>) bears &s;o great a part in them, and is &s;o mingled with al|mo&s;t every paragraph, that if what is offered upon this point is not worthy of the true Ignatius, or evi|dently exhibits the marks of an age POSTERIOR to that in which he lived, they will have fa&s;tened on them the charge of corruption, unfitting them to be depended on in the pre&s;ent, or indeed any other, debate.</P>
<P>THREE things I have here to &s;ay, which I e&s;teem worthy of particular notice, and &s;hall di&s;tinctly mention.</P>
<P N="1">I. THERE is va&s;tly more &s;aid upon the head of church-officers, than might be expected from the true Ignatius. The &s;even epi&s;tles, in the tran&s;lation of arch-bi&s;hop Wake, take up about 50 pages in octavo; and the extracts I have made from them, as they relate only to bi&s;hops and pre&s;byters, will fill at lea&s;t ten; tho' they are made from but &s;ix
<PB N="106" REF="009089_0104_10311AA2327A68B8">
of the &s;even epi&s;tles. Now, con&s;idering the cir|cum&s;tances of Ignatius, when he wrote the&s;e epi&s;tles, 'tis highly improbable, he &s;hould have his heart &s;o much &s;et upon the honor and power of the clergy, as, in all of them, to be &s;o very lavi&s;h in his di&s;|cour&s;e upon this point. He was now a "pri&s;oner of death," and on "his journey to the place of execution": And if he found within him&s;elf a di&s;|po&s;ition to write to the &s;everal churches, as he went along, 'tis really &s;trange, he &s;hould be &s;o large in his encomiums, exhortations, directions, cautions, and in&s;inuations, all tending to exalt the clergy, and be&s;peak for them the highe&s;t reverence, and mo&s;t profound &s;ubjection. Had he thus wrote in one or two only of his letters, the &s;pecial cir|cum&s;tances of the churches to whom he wrote might, perhaps, be pleaded in his excu&s;e: But it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed, &s;o many churches &s;hould be &s;o ignorant of their own con&s;titution, or of the duty they owed to the officers &s;et-over them; or that they had been &s;o faulty in their behaviour to|wards the clergy, as to make it proper for a con|demned pa&s;tor, ju&s;t going out of the world, &s;o to write to them, as if the main thing &s;uitable to be &s;aid was, "that they had very worthy, and God-becoming bi&s;hops and pre&s;byters, whom they ought to revere and honor as God the Father, and his &s;on Je&s;us Chri&s;t." There is plainly much more &s;poken upon the &s;ubject of the clergy, and their rights, than upon any other, tho' of the mo&s;t fundamental importance; which looks very &s;trange. It would certainly do &s;o in epi&s;tles, wrote at pre&s;ent, under like circum&s;tances; and the rather, as the &s;ame things are not only mentioned in all the epi&s;tles, but in mo&s;t of them needle&s;sly repeated,
<PB N="107" REF="009089_0105_10311AA41A283678">
and in &s;ome of them repeated over and over again &s;o as to be quite ful&s;ome. Should a bi&s;hop, at this day, while in the near view of death for religion's &s;ake, write epi&s;tles to the churches after this pattern, I &s;cruple not to give it as my opinion, that the ge|neral thought of the world concerning him, in this day of chri&s;tian liberty, would be, that over-heated zeal for clerical honor and power had put him out of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of him&s;elf. This leads</P>
<P N="2">II. TO the next con&s;ideration, namely, the "lofty de&s;criptions" that are given, in the&s;e epi&s;tles, of the officers of the chri&s;tian church, with the "exorbitant claims of power and dominion" made on their behalf. The language to this purpo&s;e is truly extraordinary, not at all con&s;onant to the age of the true Ignatius, nor indeed worthy of &s;o pri|mitive a father and martyr. What other thought can we entertain of tho&s;e numerous expre&s;&s;ions, which repre&s;ent bi&s;hops as "pre&s;iding in the place of God": which compare them to "God the Father, and to Je&s;us Chri&s;t the &s;on of the Father": which declare it our duty to "receive them as the Lord, to reverence them as Je&s;us Chri&s;t," yea, "to follow them even as Chri&s;t does the Father": which caution again&s;t "re&s;i&s;ting the bi&s;hop, le&s;t we &s;hould di&s;obey God": which command us "&s;o to obey the bi&s;hop, and &s;ubject our&s;elves to him, as to do nothing without him": which, "without the bi&s;hop", deem it "unlawful either to bapti&s;e, or celebrate the &s;acrament, or indeed do any thing, however rea&s;onable it may appear to us": which exhort to be "&s;o one with the bi&s;hop, as Chri&s;t is one with the Father; and &s;o to do nothing without him, as Chri&s;t did nothing without the Father":
<PB N="108" REF="009089_0106_10311AA5B2A92978">
which make &s;o great account of "obedience and &s;ubjection to the bi&s;hop," that they who "do any thing without him" are e&s;teemed "doing the devil a &s;ervice"; and "tho&s;e that remain with him" are, upon this account only, thought worthy of the character "of belonging to Chri&s;t"; and are re|pre&s;ented "as walking not as men, but according to Chri&s;t": Yea, in &s;o high e&s;timation is obedience to the officers of the church, with the author of the&s;e epi&s;tles, that he even "pawns his &s;oul for tho&s;e who obey the bi&s;hop, pre&s;byters and deacons," and de&s;ires "his portion in God may be with &s;uch."</P>
<P>THESE, and like, expre&s;&s;ions, &s;o frequently to be met with in the&s;e epi&s;tles, can't ea&s;ily be &s;uppo|&s;ed to have been penned by the true Ignatius. In their literal &s;trict &s;en&s;e, they are unworthy of any pious writer; much more of the celebrated father, to whom they are a&s;cribed: Nor can it be denied, that they aggrandi&s;e bi&s;hops beyond all rea&s;onable bounds, and plead for the mo&s;t blind, implicit and ab&s;olute obedience, as that which is properly due to them. And, in a qualified &s;en&s;e, they are &s;ome of them very unguarded; others &s;carce capable of being at all ju&s;tified; and, in general, all of them do much rather &s;avour of the language and &s;pirit "of after times," than of the age in which Ignatius is known to have lived.</P>
<P>THERE is, perhaps, no fact more notoriou&s;ly evident, than that none of the &s;acred writers, nor primitive fathers, either of the &s;ame age, or near the &s;ame age, in which Ignatius flouri&s;hed, do hold the lea&s;t affinity with him, in his &s;trange talk (if it be his) about the officers of the chri&s;tian church.

If we look into the "Pa&s;tor of Hermas," the "epi&s;tle of Polycarp," or any other genuine piece, near the time in which the&s;e epi&s;tles are &s;aid to be wrote, we &s;hall find in them all the di&s;coveries of a quite different &s;pirit. The&s;e unitedly concur in the like plain language; &s;peaking of the officers of the church in a manner becoming the &s;implicity of the go&s;pel, and the purity and humility of tho&s;e early days: Whereas, when we turn to the "Ignatian epi&s;tles," the rever&s;e is clearly vi&s;ible through them all; little being here to be &s;een but &s;uch high &s;trains of language, as are evidently adapted, if not pur|po&s;ely contrived, to exalt the clergy, and &s;ecure to them all power, reverence and &s;ubjection. And how &s;hall this be accounted for? Why &s;hould there be &s;uch a &s;ignal difference between the manner of writing in the&s;e epi&s;tles, and all the other extant books of the &s;ame age?</P>
<P>TO this it is &s;aid, that the &s;tile of authors is very different, and the turn of expre&s;&s;ion, in every writer, as peculiar to him, as his countenance or gate: For which rea&s;on, its thought to be no ways &s;trange, that the manner of Ignatius's writing is not like that of his contemporaries.</P>
<P>IT is readily acknowledged, that the particular turn of language, in different authors, is different, as is pleaded; but at the &s;ame time, denied, that this at all removes the difficulty. For a number of authors, writing upon the &s;ame &s;ubject, may each of them write in his own peculiar &s;tile, and yet a|gree in exhibiting the like account. The &s;tile of Hermas widely differs from that of Clement, as Clement's does from that of Polycarp; and yet,
<PB N="110" REF="009089_0108_10311AAC5D9A3388">
they all lead us to think much the &s;ame thing about the clergy; and this, very evidently, notwith|&s;tanding they &s;everally expre&s;s them&s;elves in a turn peculiar each one to him&s;elf. And why might not Ignatius, with the re&s;t of his contemporaries, have wrote in his own &s;tile, and yet have concurred with them in a like account of the officers of the church? 'Tis certain he might. And it mu&s;t be a&s;cribed, not to meer difference of &s;tile, but to &s;ome other cau&s;e, that he &s;o &s;trangely differs from them.</P>
<P>IT is therefore further pleaded, Ignatius was a SYRIAN, and its no other than might be expected to find him writing in a "&s;welling turgid &s;tile." To which it is ea&s;y to reply,</P>
<P>HIS being a SYRIAN may po&s;&s;ibly account for his &s;ometimes barbarous Greek, as well as uncouth compound words peculiar to him&s;elf; but how it &s;hould account for his &s;entiments concerning the clergy, as differing from tho&s;e of his contempora|ries, is not &s;o ea&s;y to &s;ay. For not only is the high language in the&s;e epi&s;tles, but the thing intend|ed by it, quite different from that which is contain|ed in the other writings about the &s;ame age. Ig|natius is alone, not in &s;tile only, but in real mean|ing. Unclothe the metaphors, qualify the hyper|boles, bring down the rhetorical &s;trains u&s;ed in the&s;e writings, and put them into &s;imple language, and their true &s;pirit, their genuine intendment, will car|ry the honor and power of the clergy much higher, than it is carried by all the phra&s;es of all the con|temporary writers united together: Nor can a per|&s;on, who reads the epi&s;tles of Ignatius, help having excited in his mind a far more exalted idea of pre&s;|byters
<PB N="111" REF="009089_0109_10311AAF82269D08">
as well as bi&s;hops, than by reading all the other writers, till we come to the third and fourth centuries.</P>
<P>THE plain truth is, there is &s;o little re&s;emblance between the&s;e epi&s;tles, upon the head under con&s;i|deration, and the other writings of the &s;ame age; and, I may add, &s;o great a re&s;emblance between them, and the writings of a POSTERIOR DATE, that one can &s;carce help thinking, the real author of them was alive in the world, long after the death of the truly primitive Ignatius.</P>
<P>HOWEVER the di&s;pute about the &s;uperiority of bi&s;hops to pre&s;byters be determined, nothing is more evident, than that the language relative to the clergy, be&s;peaking the reverence and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion due to them, was very different after the &s;econd century, from what it was before. And as the language, in the "Ignatian epi&s;tles," is quite dif|ferent, upon this head, from the language of the age in which this father lived; &s;o it well agrees with that, which was in fact u&s;ed afterwards.</P>
<P>THIS is particularly obvious, upon a compari&s;on between the books that go under the name of the "apo&s;tolical con&s;titutions, and canons," and "the&s;e epi&s;tles." Before their appearance in the editions of U&s;her and Vo&s;&s;ius, the agreement between them, not in &s;pirit only, but in words and phra&s;es, was &s;o ob&s;ervable, that &s;ome have not &s;crupled to &s;ay, that they had both one author. That great anti|quary, the arch-bi&s;hop of Armagh, was clearly of the opinion, that the &s;ame hand interpolated the Ignatian epi&s;tles, that interpolated the apo&s;tolical
<PB N="112" REF="009089_0110_10311AB1238CEFD8">
con&s;titutions; and is &s;omewhat large in offering the rea&s;ons of his entertaining &s;uch a thought. And &s;ince the publication of the new, and (as is tho't) very much purged editions, the re&s;emblance is &s;till vi&s;ible; &s;o clearly &s;o, that I can't &s;uppo&s;e, but prejudice it&s;elf will own, there is a much greater analogy between them, in their high de&s;criptions of bi&s;hops, and the honor and obedience due to them, than between the&s;e epi&s;tles, and any other piece that is not of a much later date.</P>
<P>AND what &s;hould be the rea&s;on of this? Why &s;hould the Ignatian epi&s;tles be thus different from all the contemporary writings, and &s;o much like tho&s;e which did not appear till many years after his death? Why &s;hould they be wrote with a &s;pirit, and in language, that are well &s;uited to the claims made by the clergy, and the honor and obedience that were in fact yielded to them, not at the time when they were wrote, but LONG AFTER the &s;up|po&s;ed author of them was gone out of the world? This &s;urely looks &s;u&s;picious, and is a &s;hrewd &s;ign of unfair dealing &s;ome how or other.&mdash;To proceed,</P>
<P N="3">III. THE mo&s;t weighty con&s;ideration of all is, the APPROPRIATION of the names, bi&s;hop and pre&s;byter, &s;o commonly and certainly to be met with in the&s;e epi&s;tles. The learned Daille di&s;tin|gui&s;hes this from all his other arguments, calling it "argumentum palmarium"; as well he might, it being an argument that is founded on one of the be&s;t and &s;ure&s;t rules in critici&s;m, evidencing a pre|tended genuine writing to be &s;purious, or corrupted; namely, it's u&s;ing words in an APPROPRIATED &s;en&s;e, which words were not &s;o u&s;ed at the time
<PB N="113" REF="009089_0111_10311AB2AAB190C0">
when this writing is known to have been penned, but were &s;o u&s;ed in AFTER-AGES. The greate&s;t critics ever recur to this as the &s;ure&s;t te&s;t: Nor is its &s;ufficiency, as &s;uch, in matters of this nature, di&s;puted by any. In applying therefore this te&s;t to the point in hand, let it be ob&s;erved,</P>
<P>THE words, bi&s;hop and pre&s;byter, are, in the "Ignatian epi&s;tles", APPROPRIATED terms; not u&s;ed in a loo&s;e and promi&s;cuous manner, but in a &s;en&s;e particularly a&s;certained and fixed. Bi&s;hops are not here called pre&s;byters, nor are pre&s;byters called bi&s;hops; but the officers, &s;tiled bi&s;hops, are di&s;tingui&s;hed from tho&s;e that are &s;tiled pre&s;byters, and, on the other hand, tho&s;e that are &s;tiled pre&s;|byters are, in like manner, di&s;tingui&s;hed from tho&s;e that are &s;tiled bi&s;hops. And the terms, bi&s;hop and pre&s;byter, are the APPROPRIATED ones, pointing out the&s;e different church-officers. And this appro|priation of the words is not accidental, but runs thro' all the epi&s;tles, and all the editions of them, the U&s;herian and Vo&s;&s;ian, as well as tho&s;e that pre|ceded them. And 'tis &s;o &s;acred and inviolable, that, in no ca&s;e, at no time, upon no occa&s;ion, is this u&s;e of the words departed from. Not an in|&s;tance is to be met with, where the word bi&s;hop is confounded with the word pre&s;byter; or the word pre&s;byter, with the word bi&s;hop: But the&s;e terms are accurately and religiou&s;ly applied to different per&s;ons, in a fixed and appropriated &s;en&s;e. That is the manner of diction in the&s;e epi&s;tles, "obey your bi&s;hop, and the pre&s;bytery." &mdash; "I have been judged worthy to &s;ee you by Damas, your bi&s;hop; and your pre&s;byters, Ba&s;&s;us and Apollonius."&mdash; "The bi&s;hop pre&s;iding in the place of God, your
<PB N="114" REF="009089_0112_10311AB532D30838">
pre&s;byters in the place of the council of the apo&s;tles." &mdash; "Let all reverence the bi&s;hop as the Father, and the pre&s;byters as the Sanhedrim of God." &mdash; "Attend to the bi&s;hop, and the pre&s;bytery." &mdash; But I have no need to multiply citations here. 'Tis the very thing pleaded, in favor of epi&s;copacy, that Ignatius ever di&s;tingui&s;hes bi&s;hops from pre&s;|byters. This he has been &s;aid to do (if my me|mory don't fail me) thirty-&s;ix times: Which, I am &s;ati&s;fied, is not an enlargement; tho', I mu&s;t con|fe&s;s, I have not been &s;o curious as to adju&s;t the preci&s;e number.</P>
<P>WHAT agreement now is there between the &s;up|po&s;ed Ignatius, and his contemporaries, upon this head? Do they likewi&s;e u&s;e the words, bi&s;hop and pre&s;byter, in an appropriated fixed &s;en&s;e? The plain an&s;wer is, they do not. Far from &s;o doing, they differ as much from him in their u&s;e of the&s;e terms, as they do from any of the writers of the third or fourth centuries: Nor is there an author extant, that wrote either before Ignatius, or at the time when he wrote, or even afterwards till we are got into the third century and onwards, that u&s;es the&s;e words as he does, in a &s;en&s;e &s;o certainly, &s;o commonly, and &s;o invariably fixed and determined.</P>
<P>IT is plain, there is no manner of affinity be|tween the apo&s;tolic, and Ignatian u&s;e of the&s;e words; tho' Ignatius was per&s;onally known to, at lea&s;t, &s;ome of the apo&s;tles. With HIM they are always appropriated terms; but with THEM, they are promi&s;cuou&s;ly u&s;ed, as may be &s;een in the forego|ing di&s;cour&s;e. It evidently appears from hence, that bi&s;hop and pre&s;byter were not yet &s;ettled
<PB N="115" REF="009089_0113_10311ABA57ACDA20">
names, &s;ignifying di&s;tinct officers. And this, as Daille &s;ays, was the unanimous opinion of the an|cient fathers, who &s;peak of the u&s;e of the&s;e words in this primitive age. And Dr. Whitby, an epi&s;co|pal writer, affirms the &s;ame thing; as was ob&s;erved in the di&s;cour&s;e to which this is annexed. Nay, Bellarmine him&s;elf, a Roman-catholic-writer, re|pre&s;enting the &s;en&s;e of the fathers upon this point, &s;ays, as he is quoted by Daille, "In the apo&s;tolic times, the names, bi&s;hop and pre&s;byter, were com|mon to all the prie&s;ts, both to the greater, whom we now call bi&s;hops; and to the le&s;s, whom we call pre&s;byters." I don't bring the&s;e te&s;timonies by way of proof, that the&s;e names were thus u&s;ed in the fir&s;t age; but only to &s;how, that this tho't of the matter is not confined to tho&s;e, who live in the&s;e latter days, and may be &s;u&s;pected of prejudice again&s;t the order of bi&s;hops; but that it was the opinion of the ancient fathers them&s;elves, even tho&s;e of them who flouri&s;hed after epi&s;copacy took place, and were hearty friends to this kind of go|vernment in the church.</P>
<P>AND as the&s;e names are promi&s;cuou&s;ly applied in the apo&s;tolic writings, &s;o are they in the other writings before tho&s;e of Ignatius. In Hermas's "Pa&s;tor" the word, bi&s;hops, is explained to &s;ig|nify <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Apud "Apo&s;t. Pat. Coteler." pag. 123. Simil. ix. cap. xxvii.</NOTE> "tho&s;e that pre&s;ide in the church", and tho&s;e that pre&s;ide in the church are the <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. pag. 78. Vi&s;i. II. cap. iv.</NOTE> "pre&s;by|ters that pre&s;ide in the church." And in Clement's "epi&s;tle to the Corinthians," the &s;ame officers that are called "pre&s;byters," are expre&s;sly &s;poken of as "ca&s;t out of their epi&s;copacy." <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. pag. 173. cap. xliv.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="009089_0114_10311ABBE225CA70">AND if we turn to Polycarp, the &s;uppo&s;ed col|lector of the "Ignatian epi&s;tles," and the next and neare&s;t writer to him, he &s;ays nothing from whence it can be gathered, that bi&s;hop and pre&s;by|ter were, in his day, appropriated terms, and ap|plied, as &s;uch, to di&s;tinct officers in the church. Pre&s;byters and deacons are the only officers he &s;peaks of; and he undoubtedly means by them the &s;ame church-officers that are called by Clement, and by the apo&s;tle Paul, in his epi&s;tle to this &s;ame church, bi&s;hops and deacons. And 'tis remarkable, Polycarp no where u&s;es the word bi&s;hop, nor does he &s;ay a word of the bi&s;hop of Philippi, much le&s;s of his di&s;tinction from the pre&s;byters of this church: Wherein he widely differs from Ignatius; which is really unaccountable, con&s;idering how lately Igna|tius, under very extraordinary circum&s;tances, had wrote his epi&s;tles, and how particularly acquainted Polycarp (as is pretended) was with them; e&s;pe|cially con&s;idering &s;till further, that Ignatius had wrote one epi&s;tle to Polycarp him&s;elf, and another to his church at Smyrna, in one of which he "pawns his &s;oul for them that were obedient to the bi&s;hop and the other clergy"; and, in the other, makes the bi&s;hop &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, "that no admini&s;tration could be valid without him, but whatever he &s;hould approve would be plea&s;ing to God."</P>
<P>NO more is to be &s;een of an appropriated u&s;e of the terms bi&s;hop and pre&s;byter in Ju&s;tin Martyr, than in Polycarp. Irenaeus frequently u&s;es the&s;e terms, but in the loo&s;e and promi&s;cuous &s;en&s;e; as is well known to all who have read him: Nor do the terms appear to be appropriated ones, till to|wards the clo&s;e of the &s;econd century; and even
<PB N="117" REF="009089_0115_10311ABD6A5C6FC8">
then the appropriation (as was ob&s;erved in the fore|going di&s;cour&s;e) was not &s;teadily fixed. We mu&s;t get into the third century, and the middle of it too, before we &s;hall find it, after the manner of Ignatius, &s;acred and inviolable.</P>
<P>UPON which the enquiry is obvious and ju&s;t, how comes it to pa&s;s, that Ignatius &s;hould CON|STANTLY u&s;e the terms, bi&s;hop and pre&s;byter, not in the &s;en&s;e, in which they were u&s;ed, in the age in which he wrote, but in the &s;en&s;e in which they were u&s;ed in OTHER AGES, LONG AFTER HIS DEATH? This ought certainly to excite our jealou&s;y, and put us upon caution le&s;t we &s;hould take &s;ome knavi&s;h impo&s;tor for the worthy and primitive Ignatius. Words, we know, often vary in their meaning; and &s;ometimes particular words are as &s;ure marks of &s;uch a particular age, as particular garbs or fa|&s;hions. And this is the ca&s;e here. Before the days of Ignatius, about the time of his flouri&s;hing and dying, and for &s;ome con&s;iderable time afterwards, the words, bi&s;hop and pre&s;byter, were UNAPPRO|PRIATED terms, and promi&s;cuou&s;ly applied to the &s;ame per&s;ons: Whereas, towards the going out of the age in which he lived, or rather the coming in of the next, they lo&s;t their promi&s;cuous u&s;e, and became APPROPRIATED terms, and were as &s;uch applied to different per&s;ons, who were accordingly now di&s;tingui&s;hed from each other by being &s;poken of under the&s;e names. And as the&s;e names, in the epi&s;tles a&s;cribed to Ignatius, in their pure&s;t editions, are ever u&s;ed in the APPROPRIATED &s;en&s;e, di&s;tin|gui&s;hing bi&s;hops from pre&s;byters, we are pre&s;ented with a mo&s;t evident mark of time POSTERIOR to that, in which the true Ignatius is known to have lived.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="009089_0116_10311AC030564098">ENOUGH, I tru&s;t, has now been &s;aid to an&s;wer the de&s;ign I had in view, which was to ju&s;tify tho&s;e who pay no great regard to what is bro't from the "Ignatian epi&s;tles," in &s;upport of epi&s;copacy. And I would flatter my&s;elf, that even our opponents, while they judge impartially, will not think, we herein act as tho' we had nothing to &s;ay in vindica|tion of our&s;elves. Bigotry it&s;elf mu&s;t confe&s;s there is good rea&s;on, at lea&s;t the plau&s;ible appearance of it, to &s;uppo&s;e, either that Ignatius did not write the epi&s;tles that are a&s;cribed to him; or, if he did write them, that they are handed down to us so MINGLED WITH CORRUPTION, as not to de&s;erve a reception as his genuine works.</P>
