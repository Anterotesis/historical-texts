<P>THE late Rebellion in the back Inhabitants has been the Occa&s;ion of a Number of Pamphlets being wrote and &s;pread in this Colony, &s;ome of which I have &s;een; the fir&s;t was the <HI>Narrative;</HI> which I'll venture to &s;ay is a good Thing.

<P>ALTHOUGH I am not one of that Society my&s;elf yet I have a Love for them as I have for all other good People that were &s;o well adorned with Chri&s;+tian Zeal and Piety towards GOD; to join as one Man in defence of his righteous Law'; which for+bids the &s;hedding of Innocent Blood.&mdash;Becau&s;e e+very Per&s;on is deemed innocent in the Eye of the Law&punc; untill he is proved Guilty.</P>

And when the&s;e Judges were &s;eated in the Hall of Judgment, they could not pa&s;s Sentence

<Q>thou &s;hallt neither vex a Stranger nor oppre&s;s him:</Q> And conceive to give it the greater Cen&s;ure on their Minds; the Lord tells them:

Time or indeed ever has been: But what has had &s;omething of divine Law impre&s;t upon their Minds in &s;uch &s;trong Terms, that they have fell upon Mea&s;ures of &s;ome Sort to deter every Per|&s;on from the executing that horrid Crime; but if perpetrated to puni&s;h the Criminal even with Death.&mdash;Cain Cryed out my puni&s;hment is greater than I can bare,&mdash;There was no out|ward Law to puni&s;h him,&mdash;What then?

We read no outward Law at that Time, it being (if the Word may be allowed) in the Infancy of Time before the civil Power was &s;o well e&s;tabli&s;hed as afterwards. The <HI>Apo&s;tle Paul</HI> tells us, that there was &s;ome of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> who had not the Law, were a Law unto them&s;elves,&mdash;But why don't every Chri&s;tian believe it? if he de&s;erves that Name, for my part, I am confident in that Be|lief: &mdash;And I likewi&s;e believe, that where the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> is &s;peaking of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> being endow|ed with the Spirit of Grace, that they by &s;trictly adhering to that in them&s;elves, walked as order|ly

But tho&s;e People, al+though, they have for&s;aken the Gifts of Grace they cannot fly from a guilty Con&s;cience, they have broken the Law of God, their Puni&s;hment is &s;uch, that they cannot give them&s;elves Ea&s;e&punc; neither can they receive it from another, there is a continual Knawing, as though their Bowels were rent in pieces, with Sights of Sorrow, and perpetual Griefs, that cannot be uttered: A woe|ful Feeling of the Pains of Hell, and no Relief to be had, but by delivering them&s;elves up to Ju&s;tice, and praying to God for Mercy, de&s;ir|ing that he in his Goodne&s;s would admit of that Sacrifice: And make it acceptable to him, <HI>viz.</HI> The Life of the Body as an Attonement for the Sins of the Soul. <HI>For Blood it defileth the Land and the Land cannot be clean&s;ed of the Blood that

I an&s;wer, they were innocent, for they had never been convicted by the Laws of God or Man, nor I be|lieve &s;u&s;pected by their Neighbours. They had a ju&s;t Right to all the Privileges and Advantages nece&s;&s;ary to their Occa&s;ions. Why not, they were certainly our Neighbours dwelling on Lands of their own: But if only Sojourners, we live enjoined by the Royal Law, to take nece&s;&s;ary Care that they are not Sufferers by us, and that they receive no ill at our Hands, but mu&s;t love them as our&s;elves.

<L>I' d'e rather be a Servant to the brave,</L>

<L>To put a &s;top to the &s;hedding of Man's blood,</L>

<L>My fellow Subjects let us join and pray,</L>
<L>Unto that GOD that Rules both Night and Day,</L>
<L>That he be pleas'd to put away the Cau&s;e,</L>
<L>Why wicked Men do break his Righteous Laws,</L>
<L>And give Repentance to the Sinner great,</L>
<L>That doth his Laws and ble&s;&s;ed Statutes break,</L>
<L>That in this World they may Repentance find,</L>
<L>And not hereafter be to Hell re&s;ign'd.</L>
