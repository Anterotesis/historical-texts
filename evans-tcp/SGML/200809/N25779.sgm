<HEAD>THE <HI>AUTHOR</HI>'s APOLOGY.</HEAD>
<P>SEEING this &s;ubject has employed the pens of &s;ome of the mo&s;t learned, wi&s;e, and be&s;t of men, it may be enquired why I have written, and what need there is of publi&s;hing again on this &s;ubject?</P>
<P>ANSWER. Fir&s;t. Many may read this, who never have read, and probably never will read what has been written by others.</P>
<P>SECOND. It is po&s;&s;ible that I may make &s;ome improvement on the &s;ubject in the view of &s;ome: But,</P>
<P>THIRD. If I have added nothing to the &s;ub|ject, yet my method of writing may &s;trike the minds of &s;ome, and do them good, when another's would not: Therefore,</P>
<P>FOURTHLY. It is po&s;&s;ible, through Divine Grace, it may convince &s;ome per&s;ons of the&s;e im|portant truths, and be a mean of &s;aving their &s;ouls.</P>
<P>FIFTHLY. Another rea&s;on why I publi&s;h this di&s;cour&s;e is, that hereby I may &s;peak, preach, and do good when I am dead. "He being dead, yet &s;peaketh."</P>
<P>SIXTHLY. Some have reque&s;ted that it might be publi&s;hed, and I cannot deny them.&mdash; For the&s;e rea&s;ons, I pray thee have me excu&s;ed.</P>

<P>"No man can come to me, except the FATHER, which hath &s;ent me, draw him." "And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life."</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WITHOUT any introduction, we may proceed from the&s;e important pa&s;&s;ages before us, to make this doctrinal ob&s;ervation, viz.</P>
<P><HI>THAT it is utterly impo&s;&s;ible for any of man|kind to come to CHRIST, and receive that life and &s;alvation, which he offers them as a free gift, without the almighty drawing of GOD the FA|THER.</HI></P>
<P>BEFORE I proceed to the proof of this doctrine, I would a little explain it, and the text out of which it naturally ari&s;es.</P>
<P>THIS inability, and impo&s;&s;ibility of coming to CHRIST, &s;eems to be fully contained in our text.</P>
<P>"NO man can come," implies impo&s;&s;ibil|ity that any &s;hould come to CHRIST by any means &s;hort of the Almighty drawing of the FATHER.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="034258_0004_0FFC3CD272BB7128">FOR there is no propriety in adopting the term <HI>cannot,</HI> or the phra&s;e "No man can come," if the ob&s;truction could be removed by any means &s;hort of a new creation. Or, in other words: If mankind could be made able or willing to come to Chri&s;t, by any means &s;hort of Almighty power, exerted in drawing &s;inners to Chri&s;t, it would not be proper to &s;ay, <HI>they cannot come.</HI></P>
<P>THEREFORE, when the term <HI>cannot</HI> is u&s;ed with propriety, it always means impo&s;&s;ibility, either through want of a natural power to do &s;omething that we may be willing to do; or el&s;e becau&s;e we are wholly unwilling, &s;o as to render it impo&s;&s;ible to do the thing propo&s;ed, unle&s;s the unwillingne&s;s be removed by Almigh|ty power&mdash;by a new creation.</P>
<P>THE inability which mankind labor under of coming to Chri&s;t, is one of the two now mentioned: It is either natural or moral ina|bility.</P>
<P>BY natural inability, we mean &s;uch a want of natural power and &s;trength, as renders it impo&s;&s;ible to come to Chri&s;t or to do any thing el&s;e, although the mind were willing.</P>
<P>BY moral inability, we mean &s;uch a degree of unwillingne&s;s to improve our natural abilities in coming to Chri&s;t, or doing any other thing required, as renders the doing of it impo&s;&s;ible, unle&s;s that unwillingne&s;s be removed by Al|mighty power.</P>
<P>THESE two kinds of inability are often and with propriety expre&s;&s;ed by the term <HI>can|not,</HI> both in the &s;criptures and in common lan|guage.
<PB N="5" REF="034258_0005_0FFC3CD0E4609F40">
And the one, or the other, of the&s;e two kinds of inability, is undoubtedly referred to in our text: "<HI>No man can come to me,</HI>" &amp;c.</P>
<P>AND now, that we may under&s;tand the nature of this inability, and &s;earch after all tho&s;e important truths contained in our text, we &s;hall pur&s;ue the following method:
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. SHOW what it it is to come to CHRIST.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. SHOW in what &s;en&s;e mankind are un|able to come to CHRIST, or the true rea&s;on why no man can come to him, except the FATHER draw him.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. CONCLUDE the &s;ubject by inferences, remarks, and exhortation.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">I. WE are to &s;how what is implied in coming to CHRIST.</P>
<P>AND, it implies all the following par|ticulars:</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> NOT motion of the body, or moving from one place to another; but an exerci&s;e of the heart, in which the &s;oul unites to CHTIST by love. We went away from GOD by &s;in, and en|mity of heart again&s;t him; and we can return to him, or come to CHRIST, only in the exerci&s;e of love. When one &s;tands at a di&s;tance from another, and &s;ays come to me, he enjoins upon him bodily motion, that he move from one place to another. But not &s;o here. You may come to CHRIST in the fulle&s;t &s;en&s;e of the term, and remain in the &s;eats where you are. For when Chri&s;t &s;ays, "Come unto me," he calls upon us to love him with the heart&mdash;to receive him by true love. And all that we can do, in exter|nal reformation and amendment of life, while
<PB N="6" REF="034258_0006_0FFC3CCEA058DA70">
de&s;titute of love, is not coming to CHRIST, nor taking one &s;tep towards him. And the mo&s;t awakened, convicted, and reformed &s;inner, while de&s;titute of love, is not a coming &s;inner, as &s;ome have &s;uppo&s;ed. But all &s;uch are running away from CHRIST, as fa&s;t as ever, and will not re|ceive, nor come to him. And no one ever does come to him, nor towards him, but in the exer|ci&s;e of true love. It implies too, that you love CHRIST &s;upremely&mdash;above all&mdash;more than fa|ther or mother, brothers or &s;i&s;ters, wife or chil|dren, hou&s;es or lands; and that you view CHRIST as altogether lovely, the pearl of great price, &s;o that you can &s;ell and for&s;ake all that you have for him. No one can come to CHRIST, nor be his di&s;ciple, nor love him at all, without &s;uch &s;u|preme love as this. For thus it is written: "So likewi&s;e, who&s;oever he be of you, that for|&s;aketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my di&s;|ciple."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke xiv. 33.</NOTE> And, "He that loveth father or moth|er more than me, is not worthy of me."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mat. x. 37.</NOTE> And again "If any man come to me, and hateth not," that is, does not love me, more than "his father, or mother, or wife, or children, yea, and his own life al&s;o, he cannot be my di&s;ciple,"<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Luke xiv. 26.</NOTE> or truly come to me. This coming to CHRIST there|fore implies, that we give up our vain excu&s;es: "I have bought a piece of ground, and I mu&s;t needs go and &s;ee it: I pray thee have me excu&s;|ed." "I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them: I pray thee have me excu&s;|ed." "I have married a wife, and therefore I
<PB N="7" REF="034258_0007_0FFC3CCB908C3C90">
<HI>cannot</HI> come."<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Luke xiv. 17, 81, 19, 20.</NOTE> But when the &s;oul does come to CHRIST, he gives up all the&s;e excu&s;es, as fruit|le&s;s and vain. And nothing appears to be im|portant enough to detain him a moment longer, from coming to CHRIST, and to his glorious fea&s;t of go&s;pel grace: But he for&s;akes his farm, his merchandize, his father and mother, his wife and children, yea, and all that he hath; and &s;o comes to CHRIST in the exerci&s;e of &s;piritual life and love.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> COMING to CHRIST implies be|lieving on him&mdash;that you receive his te&s;timony, and &s;et to your &s;eal that GOD is true."<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">John iii. 33.</NOTE> Com|ing to CHRIST, receiving him, and believing on him, or receiving his te&s;timony, are terms much of the &s;ame import. As it is written: "But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the &s;ons of GOD, even to them that believe on his name."<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">John i. 12.</NOTE> His name is the LORD JESUS CHRIST. And all &s;uch as heartily be|lieve in this name, "That JESUS is the CHRIST," the anointed of GOD the FATHER; "That he will &s;ave his people from their &s;ins;" That he is the "LORD GOD," and owner of all things, and thus receive his te&s;timony in favor of GOD, and again&s;t them&s;elves; do by this believing, <HI>Come to CHRIST.</HI> "Unto you therefore which believe, he is precious."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1. Pet. ii. 7.</NOTE> And when you be|lieve, and by believing, come unto CHRIST, you receive him, unite and become one with him, as the branch is one with the vine.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="034258_0008_0FFC3CC953A8C6A0"><HI>Thirdly.</HI> COMING to CHRIST implies obe|dience.&mdash;It is obeying the go&s;pel of our LORD JESUS CHRIST. The go&s;pel &s;ays, "Come:" and he that does come, obeys the go&s;pel; and that obeying the go&s;pel, is coming to CHRIST.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly.</HI> COMING to CHRIST implies hu|mility&mdash;that we become poor in &s;pirit. The proud and unhumbled, will not, and do not come to Chri&s;t for life. They feel too rich and important. For the go&s;pel &s;alvation re&s;pects mankind, as poor, in di&s;tre&s;s, in debt, and per|i&s;hing with hunger. "The poor have the go&s;|pel preached to them."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mat. xi. 5.</NOTE> "Bring in hither the poor, the maimed, and the halt, and the blind&middot;"<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Luke xiv. 21.</NOTE> All who are heartily &s;en&s;ible, that this is their lo&s;t peri&s;hing &s;tate by nature, and are thus poor in &s;pirit, will come to CHRIST for life; and none others will come. Therefore,</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly.</HI> COMING to CHRIST implies a praying &s;pirit&mdash;that you are humble enough to become beggars, and to a&s;k for mercy, with the publican: "God be merciful to me a &s;inner."<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Luke xviii. 13.</NOTE> And this brings &s;uch into the condition of the promi&s;e: "A&s;k, and it &s;hall be given you; &s;eek, and ye &s;hall find; knock, and it &s;hall be opened unto you. For every one that a&s;keth receiveth."<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Mat. xii. 7.8.</NOTE> But, "The wicked thro the pride of his countenance, will not &s;eek after GOD,"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm x. 4.</NOTE> nor come to CHRIST.</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly.</HI> COMING to CHRIST implies a willingne&s;s to be &s;aved by &s;overeign grace, thro
<PB N="9" REF="034258_0009_0FFC3CC70E8B4058">
the merits of JESUS CHRIST, and to give GOD all the glory. "Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but to thy name give glory."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm cxv. 1.</NOTE> Thus, he who comes to CHRIST, gives up the idea of e&s;|tabli&s;hing his own righteou&s;ne&s;s, and ca&s;ts away this garment that he has made, as filthy rags, that he may receive CHRIST as his righteou&s;ne&s;s, and be &s;aved by grace alone. As it is written; "By grace are ye &s;aved, through faith, and that not of your&s;elves, it is the gift of GOD."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eph. ii. 8.</NOTE> But,</P>
<P><HI>Seventhly,</HI> and <HI>La&s;tly.</HI> COMING to CHRIST implies true repentance, and hatred of &s;in. And in that very act, by which men repent of, hate, and for&s;ake their &s;ins, they do come to CHRIST. "For he &s;hall &s;ave his people from their &s;ins." And all who hate &s;in, will love &s;uch a SAVIOUR, and come to him for life. In a word, he that comes to Chri&s;t, has the &s;pirit of CHRIST dwel|ling in him. And in the exerci&s;e of this &s;pirit, he does ju&s;tly, loves mercy, and walks humbly with GOD. And thus in leaving his &s;ins, he comes to Chri&s;t. All the&s;e things, and many more, which might be mentioned, are implied in coming to Chri&s;t. We now proceed,</P>
<P N="2">II. To &s;how, in what &s;en&s;e men are una|ble, and it is impo&s;&s;ible for any one, thus to come unto Chri&s;t; and the true and only rea&s;on why the drawings of the Father are nece&s;&s;ary. And,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> WE &s;hall &s;how negatively, what is not the inability of &s;inners in coming to Chri&s;t, and then po&s;itively what it is.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="034258_0010_0FFC3CC586574698">We &s;hall all agree in this, that the inabili|ty of &s;inners in coming to Chri&s;t, is not &s;uch as to render them excu&s;able for not coming. Therefore,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;tly.</HI> It is not for want of a natural pow|er&punc; When doing a thing is connected with a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> to do it, or he could do it if he be willing, then he has natural power to do it. And when a man is willing to do a thing, and yet cannot, we call this natural inabil|ity. But this is not the inability of &s;inners to come to Chri&s;t. They could come, if they were willing. Therefore, the impo&s;&s;ibility there is of &s;inners coming to Chri&s;t, is not want of natural power and ability. If this were the ca&s;e, men could not be &s;inners, or blame worthy for not coming. But they are not required to "A&s;cend into heaven, that is, to bring Chri&s;t down from above; or to de&s;cend into the deep, that is, to bring up Chri&s;t again from the dead. But what &s;aith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart; that is, the word of faith which we preach; that if thou &s;halt confe&s;s with thy mouth the Lord Je&s;us, &amp; &s;halt believe in thine heart, that GOD hath rai&s;ed him from the dead, thou &s;halt be &s;aved."<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Rom. x. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.</NOTE> This &s;hows in the cleare&s;t light, that Chri&s;t and his &s;alvation are brought near to mankind, and offered on the mo&s;t ea&s;y terms. They are not left in heaven, in the deep, nor any where out of our reach; but are brought near to us, and offered as a free gift. "Behold I bring near my righteou&s;ne&s;s; it &s;hall not be
<PB N="11" REF="034258_0011_0FFC3CC28B7578C0">
far off; and I will place &s;alvation in Zion, for I&s;|rael my glory."<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">I&s;ai. xlvi. 12, 13.</NOTE> And, "The gift of GOD is eternal life through Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. vi. 33.</NOTE>&mdash; Thus, when &s;alvation is brought within our reach, and offered as a gift to all who are will|ing to take it; then there can be no natural inability or impo&s;&s;ibility in the way of our re|ceiving it. If Chri&s;t and his &s;alvation be "nigh thee, even in thy heart and in thy mouth," and nothing is required as a condition of enjoying this &s;alvation, but to confe&s;s with the mouth the Lord Je&s;us, and to believe in the heart that God hath rai&s;ed him from the dead; then &s;alvation is offered on the mo&s;t ea&s;y terms, and there can be no natural inability in the way of receivivg it. This appears mo&s;t evident, when we con|&s;ider, that there is no u&s;e of any natural abilities required in confe&s;&s;ing and believing, but tho&s;e <HI>only</HI> which are actually employed in denying, rejecting, and di&s;believing the Lord Je&s;us: And we have as much natural power to come unto Chri&s;t, by believing on him, as we have to re|ject and deny him by unbelief. That is, by na|tural powers and faculties, we are fitted for moral exerci&s;e; and we actually have moral exerci&s;e continually, either in loving or hating; and we are as capable of coming to Chri&s;t by love, as we are of departing from him by hatred. And this appears yet more evident, and is put beyond all di&s;pute, when we con&s;ider, that in &s;inners being made able to come to Chri&s;t, and when they actually do come, there is no new
<PB N="12" REF="034258_0012_0FFC3CC04C91B660">
natural abilities given, but only a di&s;po&s;ition to improve aright tho&s;e natural abilities which they before had.</P>
<P>THEREFORE, natural inability is not the rea&s;on why &s;inners cannot come to Chri&s;t: For they actually have natural ability, and all the natural ability which they have when they actu|ally do come.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> THE rea&s;on why it is impo&s;&s;ible for &s;inners to come to Chri&s;t, is not that he is not a proper object of love. No, for he is "Al|together lovely"&mdash;"The chiefe&s;t among ten thou&s;and."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sol. Song. v. 10.</NOTE> If this were not &s;o, and there were really no beauty in Chri&s;t, that we &s;hould de&s;ire him, and we could not love him on this account, then we could not be blame-worthy. But Chri&s;t Je&s;us has every lovely qualification; and yet, no man can love him, nor come to him, without the drawing of the Father.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly.</HI> THE rea&s;on why &s;inners cannot believe and come to Chri&s;t, is not want of evi|dence to ground faith upon; not for want of evidence of the real loveline&s;s of Chri&s;t, and the certainty of tho&s;e truths he requires us to be|lieve. No, for the loveline&s;s of Chri&s;t's char|acter, and the unque&s;tionable truth of his te&s;ti|mony, and all he requires us to believe, is held up to view in the cleare&s;t light. So that he is really "The light of the world."<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">John viii. 12.</NOTE> Sometimes we cannot love a per&s;on for want of evidence that he is lovely, nor believe in him for want of evidence that he &s;peaks the truth. In &s;uch
<PB N="13" REF="034258_0013_0FFC3CBEC5B10030">
a ca&s;e, there is no blame: But not &s;o in this ca&s;e. "For there are three that bear record in heaven; and there are three that bear witne&s;s in earth," in favor of Chri&s;t, and of the truth of all his te&s;timony. Yet, it is impo&s;&s;ible for &s;inners to believe in him, or come to him, ex|cept the Father draw them. But,</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly.</HI> THIS inability does not con&s;i&s;t in want of conviction that Chri&s;t is thus a proper object of love; and of the truth, reality, and importance of his te&s;timony, and of &s;piritual and divine things. Many, at lea&s;t, thro conviction of con&s;cience, or judgment, have thot that the te&s;timony of Chri&s;t is true, and that he is worthy to be loved by all men; and yet, no man can love him, nor come to him, except he is drawn by God the Father.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> THE ground of this inability is not want of motives to per&s;uade men to come to Chri&s;t. But there are the mo&s;t powerful motives or rea&s;ons held up to the view of &s;inners to engage them to come unto Chri&s;t and be &s;aved.</P>
<P>ALL the inexpre&s;&s;ible joys of heaven, and all the dreadful torments of hell, are holden up to their view; and by the voice of the Almighty, are made to thunder in their ears to give them warning, that they &s;hould come to Chri&s;t for life, and flee from the wrath to come. And there is no proper motive, or argument, but what is con|tained in the word and providence of God, and there held up to the view of &s;inners, to come to Chri&s;t. Yet, there is a cannot, which will eter|nally hinder them from coming to Chri&s;t, "Ex|cept the Father draw them."</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="034258_0014_0FFC3CBC707B58B0"><HI>Sixthly.</HI> ALTHOUGH &s;inners cannot come to Chri&s;t; It is not becau&s;e that &s;atan, or any other being overpowers them, &s;o as to hinder them from coming, contrary to their inclinations. Satan has no power to hinder any one from com|ing to Chri&s;t, only by his artful devices, in per|&s;uading, flattering, and deceiving. He promi&s;|es all the riches and honors of this world, which he has no power to give, if men will wor&s;hip him, continue in his &s;ervice, and neglect to come to Chri&s;t, and receive his great &s;alvation. But he has no power to force men, contrary to their wills, to pur&s;ue after the riches, honors, and plea&s;|ures of the world, and hereby to neglect coming to Chri&s;t, and receiving his free &s;alvation.</P>
<P><HI>Seventhly.</HI> THE rea&s;on why &s;inners cannot come to Chri&s;t, is not that more plea&s;ure and happine&s;s are to be enjoyed in &s;in, and in the &s;er|vice of &s;atan than in coming to Chri&s;t, and enter|ing into the &s;ervice of God. Satan tries to keep people in his &s;ervice, and is &s;ucce&s;sful in it, by per&s;uading them to believe, that if they leave his &s;ervice and become the &s;ervants of God, they will loo&s;e all their plea&s;ure and happi|ne&s;s. Yet, this is &s;o far from being true, that all the real happine&s;s there is in the univer&s;e, among creatures, is in the love and &s;ervice of God. And "Wi&s;dom's ways are ways of plea&s;|antne&s;s, and all her paths are peace."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Prov. iii. 17.</NOTE> And &s;inners have conviction that this is the ca&s;e, even while they greedily pur&s;ue the plea&s;ures of &s;in, and cannot leave them to come to Chri&s;t, and enjoy the mo&s;t refined plea&s;ures of religion. But,</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="034258_0015_0FFC3CB970DA0AE0"><HI>Eigthly, and La&s;tly.</HI> The rea&s;on why no man can come to Chri&s;t, except the Father draw him; is not that Chri&s;t, is not willing to receive all that will come to him. For, he &s;ays, "come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you re&s;t." And again "Him that cometh unto me, I will in no wi&s;e ca&s;t out."</P>
<P>Thus, we have been &s;earching on every &s;ide, to find what the inability of mankind in coming to Chri&s;t, does not con&s;i&s;t in. And we now come to &s;how po&s;itively, what that inability real|ly is, which hinders &s;uch multitudes from com|ing to Chri&s;t, and renders it impo&s;&s;ible for any man to come, except the Father draw him. And,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;tly.</HI> WHEN we read the latter part of our text, it is evident, beyond all di&s;pute, what that inability is, which is &s;poken of in the former part; that it con&s;i&s;ts, wholly con&s;i&s;ts, in an ob|&s;tinate and perver&s;e <HI>will. "And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life."</HI></P>
<P>But why is the will thus oppo&s;ed, and men &s;o wholly unwilling to come to Chri&s;t, and re|ceive life at his hand?</P>
<P>Becau&s;e we have &s;et up for independency on God. And Chri&s;t has come to re-e&s;tabli&s;h God's authority over us; and claims to be a King. But, "<HI>We will not have this man to reign over us.</HI>"<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Luke xix. 14.</NOTE> Therefore, we connot come to him, nor receive him, as our Lord and King. "Art thou a King then?" "We have no King, but Ce&s;ar." "Who is Lord over us?"</P>
<P>Not only this; but Chri&s;t claims to be a prophet al&s;o; and we do not like his in&s;tructions,
<PB N="16" REF="034258_0016_0FFC3CB72B189F90">
we do not agree with him in &s;entiment. He de|clares the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God, and te&s;tifies of the world that the works thereof are evil; that we are of our father the devil, and his lu&s;ts we will do: He declares him&s;elf to be the bread of life; and that except we eat his fle&s;h and drink his blood, we have no life in us. But we are rea|dy to adopt the language of the unbelieving Jews: "How can this man give us his fle&s;h to eat?" This is an hard &s;aying, who can hear it?"<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">John vi.</NOTE> We cannot, we will not come to, nor receive &s;uch a prophet as this to teach us. No, for we "Say to the &s;eers, &s;ee not; and to the prophets prophe&s;y not unto us right things; &s;peak unto us &s;mooth things, prophe&s;y deceits, get you out of the way, turn a&s;ide out of the path; cau&s;e the holy one of I&s;rael to cea&s;e from before us." <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah xxx. 8.9.10.11.</NOTE> We cannot en|dure that &s;uch a God as this, &s;hould be held up to our view. "Away with him, away with him," for we will not have &s;uch a teacher as this.</P>
<P>And be&s;ides; Chri&s;t claims to be a prie&s;t, to make atonement for us. This repre&s;ents, that we have committed &s;ins for which we can make no atonement our&s;elves, and for which we de&s;erve to die. Therefore, we cannot, we will not receive &s;uch a prie&s;t as this.</P>
<P>Moreover; &s;uch an atonement as Chri&s;t has made, by his death and &s;ufferings, as an high prie&s;t, and the go&s;pel which he preaches, repre&s;ent us, as "Wretched, and mi&s;erable, and poor, and blind, and naked," lo&s;t and un|done. But we do not feel this to be our ca&s;e; therefore we <HI>cannot,</HI> that is, we <HI>will not</HI> come to

Therefore, you cannot, you will not come to Chri&s;t that you might have life. You want life, but while you do not believe with the prodigal &s;on, that you are peri&s;hing with hunger, and are not "<HI>Poor in &s;pirit,</HI>" you will not have this want &s;upplied. Your feeling rich in &s;pirit, your pride, will not &s;uffer you to come to Chri&s;t, that you might have life; and receive it of his hand, as a free gift, to a poor beggar.</P>
<P>AND be&s;ides all this; we are &s;upremely in love with the world. "I have bought a piece of ground, and I mu&s;t needs go and &s;ee it&punc;" I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I mu&s;t go to prove them: I pray thee have me excu&s;ed." I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come," "<HI>No man can come,</HI>" becau&s;e he loves his farm, his merchandi&s;e, his wife, or &s;omething in the world above Chri&s;t. And by cleaving to the&s;e things, all make light of the invitations of the go&s;pel; and no man can for&s;ake them, and come to Chri&s;t. "<HI>And they would not come.</HI>"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mat. xxii. 3,</NOTE> "And how can ye believe which receive honor one of another, and &s;eek not the honor which cometh from God only?" Ye cannot.</P>
<P>AGAIN; the will is thus, oppo&s;ed, &s;o that "No man can come to Chri&s;t except the Father draw him," becau&s;e all are &s;inners; wholly in|clined to &s;in, and unwilling to be &s;aved from their &s;ins. &s;o that "In them, there dwells no
<PB N="18" REF="034258_0018_0FFC3CB35CBA08D0">
good thing." Hence no man can come, and no man will come to Chri&s;t, becau&s;e he "Saves his people <HI>from</HI> their &s;ins," and will not &s;ave them <HI>in</HI> their &s;ins. If Chri&s;t would &s;ave people in their &s;ins; all &s;inners would be able, and wil|ling to come to him, upon the fir&s;t invitation, without any drawing, be&s;ides their own inclina|tions. But now, they connot come to Chri&s;t, becau&s;e they will not leave their &s;ins, nor con&s;ent to be &s;aved from them. And if there were any good thing in them; any thing but &s;in; or the lea&s;t &s;park of virtue, and moral goodne&s;s; it would lead them to Chri&s;t&mdash;they could, and would then come to him.</P>
<P>BUT becau&s;e there is nothing in man by na|ture, that is morally good, any more than there is in the devils and damned in hell; and becau&s;e they are, "Of their father the devil," therefore they <HI>cannot,</HI> they <HI>will</HI> not come to Chri&s;t. This, and this only, is the great inability, which ren|ders it impo&s;&s;ible for &s;inners to come to Chri&s;t, "Except the Father draw them."</P>
<P>AND now, as a further proof, that this is the inability of &s;inners, and the true rea&s;on why they connot come to Chri&s;t; the following things are ob&s;erved.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;tly.</HI> WHEN &s;inners are drawn to Chri&s;t by the Father, and actually do come, nothing is done to them, but to make them willing. As it is written: "Thy people &s;hall be willing in the day of thy power."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm cx. 3.</NOTE> The power of God is ex|erted <HI>only</HI> on the <HI>will,</HI> in drawing &s;inners to Chri&s;t. Before this, "They would not come." But
<PB N="19" REF="034258_0019_0FFC3CB02845A588">
now they are willing, and do come. For, being willing, is coming. And all inability is now re|moved, when the will is bowed.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> ALL the offers of Chri&s;t and his &s;alvation are made to all who are willing. "The &s;pirit and the bride &s;ay come, and who&s;oever will, let him take the water of life freely." "If there be fir&s;t a willing mind, it is accepted, accor|ding to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not." "If ye be willing and obe|dient, ye &s;hall eat the good of the land, but if ye refu&s;e and rebel, ye &s;hall be devoured; for the mouth of the Lord hath &s;poken it."</P>
<P>THIS &s;hows very plainly, that &s;alvation is &s;e|cured to all tho&s;e, who are willing to take it; and that there can be no inability in the way of enjoying it, but an <HI>unwilling,</HI> and di&s;obedient mind. If there were, or could be any other in|ability, there would be no propriety in offering &s;alvation to all, who are willing to take it, with|out mentioning the other ob&s;truction that might be in the way.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly.</HI> THAT good, which the go&s;pel of|fers, is promi&s;ed to every one, who will a&s;k for it. "A&s;k, and ye &s;hall receive." This &s;hows, that there can be nothing to hinder the enjoy|ment of Chri&s;t, and his &s;alvation, except that di&s;|like of the heart, and oppo&s;ition of the will, by which we refu&s;e to a&s;k, and receive. "For ev|ery one that wills or de&s;ires this &s;alvation, does a&s;k for it, and receives it. Hence, there can be no ob&s;truction in the way of a&s;king &s;alvation by Chri&s;t, but the di&s;like of the heart, or oppo&s;ition of the will.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="034258_0020_0FFC3CADEACC7778"><HI>Fourthly.</HI> SINNERS being invited, and com|manded to come to Chri&s;t, and obey the go&s;pel, implies that they have natural ability to come, and there can be no inability, to come, except a rebellious will. Otherwi&s;e,</P>
<P>GOD would require according to what men have not: He would require obedience, where he has not given natural power to obey; which would be unrea&s;onable; and is contrary to what God &s;ays he doth, in requiring only according to "That a man hath:" This is, according to his natural abilities, and talents.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly.</HI> MEN's not coming to Chri&s;t, is repre&s;ented as di&s;obeying the go&s;pel. But, if &s;inners labored under any other inability of com|ing to Chri&s;t be&s;ides a &s;tubborn will; then, their not coming, could not be called di&s;obedi|ence to the go&s;pel.</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly.</HI> THOSE who do not come to Chri&s;t, are repre&s;ented in &s;cripture, as neglecting his "Great &s;alvation."<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Heb. ii. 3.</NOTE> But this <HI>neglect,</HI> nece&s;&s;a|rily implies contempt, making light of, and refu|&s;ing Chri&s;t and his great &s;alvation, when it is brought within our reach, and all other ob&s;truc|tions are removed out of the way, except this un|willing mind, by which the &s;alvation is con|temned and refu&s;ed.</P>
<P><HI>Seventhly.</HI> AN everla&s;ting cur&s;e is denoun|ced in the &s;criptures again&s;t every one who does not come to Chri&s;t, by true love. "If any man love not the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, let him be an athema, maranatha."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1. Cor. xvi. 22.</NOTE> But this cur&s;e would be very unrea&s;onable, if men labored under any
<PB REF="034258_0021_0FFC3CAC597F9298">
inability of coming to Chri&s;t by love, except their voluntary oppo&s;ition to him; and hating him with all their heart. "Ye have both &s;een and hated, both me and my Father." And there|fore you cannot, you "Will not come to me that ye might have life." <HI>This cannot,</HI> and this <HI>will not,</HI> imply the <HI>&s;ame</HI> kind and degree of in|ability. And the only rea&s;on why "No man can come to Chri&s;t, except the Father draw him," is that the unwillingne&s;s is &s;o great, that nothing le&s;s than the drawing of the Father, in the day of his almighty power, can conquer and make &s;inners willing to come unto Chri&s;t, and receive life through him. "And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life."</P>
<P>THUS, if all that is done to &s;inners in draw|ing them to Chri&s;t, is making them willing; and when they are willing, they do come: then all their inability lies in a &s;tubborn will.</P>
<P>AND if all the offers of Chri&s;t and his &s;alva|tion, are made to all who are willing to receive them; and when any are willing, they do re|ceive them; then all inability lies in the will.</P>
<P>AND if the go&s;pel &s;alvation is promi&s;ed to every one, who will a&s;k for it, and all who are willing, do a&s;k, and receive; then all inability of receiving this &s;alvation lies in the will.</P>
<P>AND if the invitations of the go&s;pel nece&s;&s;a|rily imply, that there is no natural inability in the way of receiving; then they certainly imply, that nothing is in the way of enjoyment, except unwillingne&s;s to receive.</P>
<P>AND if our not coming to Chri&s;t, to the go&s;pel fea&s;t, is di&s;obeying the go&s;pel; then all
<PB REF="034258_0022_0FFC3CAA14C1A8E0">
inability to come, lies in a perver&s;e will; for any other inability, could not properly be term|ed di&s;obedience.</P>
<P>AND if tho&s;e, who do not come to Chri&s;t, are neglecters of his great &s;alvation, and make light of it; then certainly it is brought within their reach, within the compa&s;s of their natural abilities, and nothing in them prevents enjoy|ment, but a contemning, proud, and unwilling mind. They &s;corn the thing. They make light of it, and neglect a great &s;alvation, which is brot nigh to them, and offered to their choice.</P>
<P>AND if an everla&s;ting cur&s;e is fa&s;tened on every one who does not come to Chri&s;t, by true faith and love; and if this cur&s;e can ju&s;tly be inflicted, then there can be no inability of com|ing to Chri&s;t, by true faith and love, except a wicked and rebellious will.</P>
<P>THUS, we have found the Achan in the camp&mdash;that &s;inners <HI>cannot come to Chri&s;t,</HI> becau&s;e they <HI>will not come,</HI> except they are drawn, or made willing by God the Father, in the day of his almighty power.</P>
<P>AND now, if the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t ju&s;tly &s;u&s;tains the office of a King, then all are under obligation to obey him. And if our wills are thus oppo&s;ed to him, as we have proved, &s;o that we cannot receive him, and "Will not have this man to reign over us," then we violate our obligation, and are without excu&s;e.</P>
<P>AND if Chri&s;t ju&s;tly &s;u&s;tains the office of a prophet to teach us, of a prie&s;t to atone for us, and a phy&s;ician to heal us; then all men are un|der obligations to receive him in the&s;e offices;
<PB REF="034258_0023_0FFC3CA6F3762608">
and if our wills are &s;o oppo&s;ed, that we cannot; then, why is not this inability mo&s;t criminal and wicked?</P>
<P>AND if the te&s;timony of Chri&s;t, as a proph|et was righteous and good; then all are under obligation to receive it, and &s;et to their &s;eal that God is true. And if our wills are thus oppo&s;ed to this te&s;timony, becau&s;e it is good, and no man receiveth it, nor can receive it; then, why are we not guilty?</P>
<P>AND if Chri&s;t was holy, harmle&s;s, and un|defiled, &s;eparate from &s;inners, made higher than the heavens, and was God; then all are under infinite obligations to come to him, to receive him, to love him with all the heart, and to obey him as Lord and King. And if no man can come to him, nor receive him becau&s;e he is thus holy, and they are unholy; even to &s;uch a degree, that they will not have this man, this King, this God, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> reign over them; then, their inability, their cannot, which all centers in a rebellious will, mu&s;t be an infinite crime, and no excu&s;e.

And, "Then &s;hall ye under&s;tand the fear of the Lord, and find the knowledge of God, when thou &s;eeke&s;t her as &s;ilver, and &s;earche&s;t for her, as for hid trea&s;ure." But how do men &s;eek &s;il|ver? They &s;eek it with love, and earne&s;t de&s;ire after it. Their wills are in this pur&s;uit. Hence &s;ays the apo&s;tle, "They that <HI>will</HI> be rich," &amp;c.
<PB N="25" REF="034258_0025_0FFC3CA2F4A07538">
But the natural man, who cannot know the things of the &s;pirit of God, nor under&s;tand the fear of the Lord, does not thus &s;eek after it, as men &s;eek &s;ilver. His will is to oppo&s;ed to it. And he is "Willingly ignorant;" and "Does not like to retain God in his knowledge." In this view it is written, "How long ye &s;imple ones will ye love &s;implicity, and the &s;corners delight in their &s;corning, and fools hate knowledge?"<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Prov. i. 22.</NOTE></P>
<P>THUS, all the ignorance and want of un|der&s;tanding there is in the "Natural man," is becau&s;e of this blindne&s;s of the heart, by which mankind will not acquaint them&s;elves with God, nor come to Chri&s;t, as a prophet to teach them. And therefore it is, that among natural men, or tho&s;e in a &s;tate of nature, "There is none that <HI>under&s;tandeth,</HI> there is none that &s;eeketh after God." And, <HI>when</HI> the heart is &s;et right, and becomes &s;piritual, then the under&s;tanding is en|lightened, in the knowledge of God, and the things; of the &s;pirit of God; which things, the natural man cannot under&s;tand; becau&s;e they are &s;piritually di&s;cerned. "But he that is &s;pir|itual, judgeth all things." Now, he under&s;tands the fear of the Lord, and finds the knowl|edge of God. And &s;o far as the hearts of men are &s;et right with God, and they are willing to under&s;tand and do their duty; &s;o far, they are as capable of under&s;tanding the things of the &s;pirit of God, as they are to under&s;tand the arts and &s;ciences, or any natural things. The&s;e men <HI>can</HI> under&s;tand; even while their hearts are full of wickedne&s;s. Let all the blindne&s;s in man be
<PB N="26" REF="034258_0026_0FFC3CA0C066F378">
removed, which is occa&s;ioned by an evil heart; or, let their hearts be wholly &s;et right with God, and made &s;piritual; then all inability to under|&s;tand &s;piritual things, would be removed, and the under&s;tanding in men, be as good, as that of Adam in innocency. Therefore, this want of under&s;tanding in men, and the ignorance in them being occa&s;ioned by the blindne&s;s of the heart, is no proof of any inability in them be&s;ides an evil heart, or a rebellious will. But it is a far|ther proof, that all the inability of &s;inners, in coming to Chri&s;t, lies <HI>in an evil and wicked heart,</HI> or, a <HI>rebellious will</HI>; by rea&s;on of which, "There is none that under&s;tandeth, there is none that &s;eeketh after God," and no man can come to Chri&s;t, "Except the Father draw him." Hav|ing thus endeavored to &s;how as clearly as po&s;&s;i|ble, what it is to come to Chri&s;t, and the true rea&s;on why no man can come to Chri&s;t without the almighty drawing of God the Father, we now proceed,</P>
<P N="3">III. To conclude the &s;ubject, by a few in|ferences, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;tly.</HI> We &s;ee the propriety of u&s;ing the word <HI>cannot,</HI> to expre&s;s <HI>moral inability,</HI> or unwil|lingne&s;s. It is certainly u&s;ed &s;o in our text. "No man can come to me," certainly means, that men are wholly unwilling; and is expre&s;|&s;ive of moral character, even the total depravity, and wickedne&s;s of the hearts of all men, by na|ture. If there were only &s;ome degree of unwil|lingne&s;s in &s;inners to come to Chri&s;t; which might be removed by &s;ome means &s;hort of a new creation, then it would not be proper to &s;ay they
<PB N="27" REF="034258_0027_0FFC3C9DCF5FC2B0">
<HI>cannot</HI> come. But when the hearts of men are "Full of evil," and in their fle&s;hly mind there "Dwells no good thing," &s;o that through the total wickedne&s;s of the heart, their wills are wholly oppo&s;ed to coming unto Chri&s;t; and they will not come, by any means that can be u&s;ed with them &s;hort of a new creation, or the drawing of the Father; then, with great propri|ety, we may &s;ay, <HI>they cannot come.</HI> Can we come, or do any thing what&s;oever, when the will is wholly oppo&s;ed? E&s;pecially, if willing to come to Chri&s;t, is coming, can we then come while we will not? No, for this unwillingne&s;s implies that we do not come; or it will as certainly prevent our coming, or doing any thing el&s;e, as if we had no natural power; and is as properly expre&s;&s;ed by the term <HI>connot.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> We &s;ee the propriety of exhort|ing men to do that which they cannot do, in this &s;en&s;e. Natural inability in coming to Chri&s;t, or to do any thing el&s;e, would excu&s;e them, and render it improper to exhort them to come. But when we have natural ability to come; and no inability be&s;ides unwillingne&s;s; then we are proper &s;ubjects of command and exhortation; even altho it be impo&s;&s;ible to obey, while thus unwilling, and by rea&s;on of this unwillingne&s;s. No parent would ever excu&s;e his child, or ne|glect to command him, becau&s;e he could not, or it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to obey, only by rea|&s;on of a &s;tubborn will. When the child &s;ays, I cannot do this, or that, which the parent knows he has natural power to do, or that his <HI>cannot</HI> con&s;i&s;ts wholly in unwillingne&s;s; he then re|peats
<PB N="28" REF="034258_0028_0FFC3C9B884BE2D8">
his commands, and adds his threatnings. And is there no propriety in this conduct? Yet, there are &s;ome, who complain of preachers at this day, &s;aying; they will preach in the fore|noon that men &s;hould come to Chri&s;t, to the go&s;|pel fea&s;t; but tell them in the afternoon, that they cannot come Well, is not Chri&s;t &s;uch a preacher? He invites them to come to him, and in the &s;ame &s;ermon, he tells them they cannot come, and they will not come to him, "That they might have life." And if all the inability, the <HI>cannot,</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in a perver&s;e will, as we have &s;een; then, with the greate&s;t propriety he may invite, exhort, and command &s;uch impotent, un|able, or unwilling &s;inners to come to him; and threaten them with eternal death, if they do not obey. And all this, whether you view it con&s;i&s;t|ent or not, is in fact done by Chri&s;t. He in|vites, and commands all to come to him; he &s;ays, "No man can come to me, except the Fa|ther draw him;" and yet threatens them with eternal death, who cannot, and who do not come to him, by faith and love. "He that be|lieveth &s;hall be &s;aved; but he that believeth not &s;hall be damned. Again: "If any man love not the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, let him be accur&s;ed." All this appears perfectly con&s;i&s;tent, when we admit the evidence exhibited from &s;cripture, that this inability is found only in &s;inners, and con&s;i&s;ts wholly in &s;in, in the total depravity of the human heart; in its being de&s;titute of every thing that it morally good, and wholly under the influence of a &s;tubborn, perver&s;e, and wicked will. "And ye will not come to me, that ye

might have life." In this view of things, min|i&s;ters may, with the greate&s;t propriety preach to &s;inners as Chri&s;t did; and urge upon them the moving invitations of the go&s;pel; the impo&s;&s;i|bility there is that they &s;hould obey it, and come to Chri&s;t, "Except it were given them from above," and yet pre&s;s upon them their inexcu|&s;able obligations to obey the go&s;pel, and come to Chri&s;t, on pain of death; even the &s;econd death. As it is written; "The Lord Je&s;us &s;hall be re|vealed from heaven, with his mighty angels, in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the go&s;pel of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t: Who &s;hall be puni&s;hed with everla&s;ting de&s;truction from the pre&s;ence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power; when he &s;hall come to be glorified in his &s;aints, and to be admired in all them that believe."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2. The&s;s. i. 7.8.9.10.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly.</HI> From what has been &s;aid, it ap|pears evident, that the only ground of the nece&s;&s;i|ty of regeneration, or of almighty power to draw men to Chri&s;t, lies in the total depravity of their heart, &s;o that in them, "There dwells no good thing;" not the lea&s;t degree of willingne&s;s to re|ceive, and come to Chri&s;t. Hence the power of God, in regeneration, is exerted <HI>only</HI> on the <HI>will</HI>; in forming that to repentance, love and obedience; or, in making men willing to receive Chri&s;t and his great &s;alvation. "Thy people &s;hall be willing in the day of thy power."</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly.</HI> We learn, that as the inability of &s;inners con&s;i&s;ts in their &s;infulne&s;s, it can afford them no excu&s;e; but renders them altogether
<PB N="30" REF="034258_0030_0FFA6B52AB127570">
criminal, and inexcu&s;able. And the more un|able men are to come to Chri&s;t, by rea&s;on of un|willingne&s;s, the greater is their criminality. And the greater power it requires to make men wil|ling and obedient, or to draw them to Chri&s;t, argues, and proves, &s;o much greater &s;trength of unwillingne&s;s and &s;in. And if it requires an al|mighty, creative power, even a new creation, to reconcile &s;inners to God, and make, them come to Chri&s;t; it proves that their hearts are <HI>full of evil,</HI> nothing but &s;in.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly.</HI> A wrong view of the inability of &s;inners, is one principal ground of their &s;ecurity in &s;in. Many &s;eem to make their inability to come to Chri&s;t, a cloak for their great &s;in of unbelief. Hence they often a&s;k, "If I cannot come to Chri&s;t why am I blame-worthy?" Let me vary the que&s;tion a little. If I am &s;o unwil|ling, and &s;o wicked, that I cannot love Chri&s;t, nor come to him, why am I wicked at all? Or why am I to be blamed for that in which all my blame-worthine&s;s and wickedne&s;s con&s;i&s;ts? or for having &s;uch hatred to Chri&s;t, the be&s;t of be|ings, that I cannot receive him? This que&s;tion may be an&s;wered thus: If I cannot come to Chri&s;t becau&s;e I will not; then I am to blame for this very rea&s;on, <HI>becau&s;e I cannot.</HI> But if I cannot come when I am willing, becau&s;e I have not natural power, how am I then to be blamed? We an&s;wer, you are not: And if you are wil|ling, you have come already. But there is no &s;uch inability in any man to free him from blame. Yet, this natural inability is that for which ma|ny plead, and by which they mean to excu&s;e
<PB N="31" REF="034258_0031_0FFC3C97B12CAB38">
them&s;elves from blame. Hence it is often &s;aid, I &s;hould be glad to come to Chri&s;t, if I could, but I cannot. This implies, that the inability in the will is actually removed, and there is yet an inability, which does both keep them from Chri&s;t, and free them from blame. But this is a wrong view of inability; and &s;erves only to keep &s;in|ners at ea&s;e in their &s;ins. Such therefore, as do not come to Chri&s;t by faith and love; and yet imagine that they are willing to come, but can|not, are &s;tupid, unconvicted &s;inners, and never knew the plague of their own hearts. And whenever they are made to &s;ee the plague of the heart, they will change their voice, and &s;ay, we could come to Chri&s;t if we would, but the will not. That is, we are now convicted that nothing is in the way of coming to Chri&s;t, but an ob&s;tinate and perver&s;e will; which leaves us without any excu&s;e, or cloak for our &s;in. As Chri&s;t &s;ays, "If I had not come, and &s;poken to them, they had not had &s;in, but now, they have no cloak for their &s;in." If &s;inners really believ|ed this, and had thorough conviction of con|&s;cience, that their inability was their crime, and no excu&s;e, it would put an utter end to &s;ecurity, and make them cry out with the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Jail- "What mu&s;t I do to be &s;aved?"</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly.</HI> All pleas in favor of any inabilty to come to Chri&s;t, which do not con&s;i&s;t in a &s;in|ful unwillingne&s;s, betray the deceitfulne&s;s, and great wickedne&s;s of our hearts. The language of all &s;uch pleas, are in favor of independence, and &s;how that we are determined to maintain it &mdash;that being unable to come to Chri&s;t, believe,
<PB N="32" REF="034258_0032_0FFC3C94889EAA40">
and obey the go&s;pel, we are under no obliga|tions&mdash;and, that neither the law, nor the go&s;pel can bind us to obedience, when we "Cannot come," nor obey. Hence we are all excu&s;ed, becau&s;e we cannot come to Chri&s;t, and obey the law, nor the go&s;pel. And here, we may re&s;t &s;e|cure, until God &s;hall draw, and make us able, or willing to come.</P>
<P>Thus &s;inners in their own imaginations, have made the law void and of none effect, and brot down all God's commands in the law, and go&s;pel too, on a level with their di&s;po&s;itions; &s;o, that unle&s;s God make them willing, they are un|der no obligation to obey. And here they re&s;t; crying "Peace, peace, when there is no peace;" but they are every moment expo&s;ed to be "Suddenly de&s;troyed, and that without rem|edy."<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxix. 1.</NOTE> And this de&s;truction, "From the pre&s;|ence of the Lord, and from the glory of his pow|er," is coming upon them, for that very inabil|ity, which is the ground of their &s;ecurity: or becau&s;e they "Cannot come to Chri&s;t," and "Obey not the go&s;pel of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; they &s;hall be puni&s;hed with everla&s;ting de&s;truc|tion," &amp;c. How little ground is there then, or rather, there is no ju&s;t grounds, for this &s;ecurity of unbelieving &s;inners, on account of their ina|bility to repent and believe the go&s;pel; or on any account what&s;oever. Therefore,</P>
<P><HI>Seventhly.</HI> We &s;ee, "That God's law, and his right to command, remain in full force," as &s;ome ju&s;tly ob&s;erve,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I here refer my readers to Mr. We&s;t, Mr. Smalley, and Mr. Spalding, on this &s;ubject of inability.</NOTE> and as is fully expre&s;&s;|ed

in the &s;criptures of truth, notwith&s;tanding all the inability of &s;inners to obey. God doth not give up his right to command, nor le&s;&s;en his commands, either in the law, or go&s;pel, in the lea&s;t degree, on account of any inability in men to obey them. But all that was required of Ad|am in innocency, is now required of all his po&s;|terity&mdash;that all &s;hould "Love the Lord their God, with all their heart, and their neighbor as them&s;elves." And that they &s;hould be perfect, even as God is perfect. All this appears perfect|ly rea&s;onable, when we con&s;ider, that by the fall, men lo&s;t no <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ability to obey, <HI>except a willing mind.</HI> In all other re&s;pects, &s;inners are as able to keep the law perfectly, as Adam was in inno|cency.

And gives no hope, that this cur&s;e will ever be taken off, but only by hearty obedience to the go&s;pel, in coming to Chri&s;t for life; which &s;inners thro unwillingne&s;s, never can do, "Except the Fa|ther draw them." Notwith&s;tanding the fall, &s;inners &s;till maintain their natural abilities to do well, to obey the law, and the go&s;pel; and it is &s;till required of them to do it, by all the autho|rity of God. Yet being prone to evil, as the &s;parks are to fly upward, &amp; wholly indi&s;po&s;ed to do well; they can do evil, are "Wi&s;e to do it; but to do good they have no might," "No man can come to me," &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Eighthly.</HI> If the inability of mankind to be holy, or to come to Chri&s;t in the exerci&s;e of

faith and love, con&s;i&s;teth in the ob&s;tinacy of their will; then, it is manife&s;t, that there is no good rea&s;on, why they &s;hould not be called upon, to come immediately to Chri&s;t, in the exerci&s;e of true repentance and faith.

"And they went out and preached that men &s;hould repent."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mark vi. 12. and Acts xx. 21.</NOTE></P>
<P>Such preachers therefore, and many &s;uch there are, who, on account of &s;inners' inability to come to Chri&s;t immediately, in the exerci&s;e of holy faith and love, are directing them to impen|itent prayers and doings, in order to obtain of God repentance and faith, in this way of du|ty, as they call it: Such I &s;ay, "Yet not I, but the Lord," are "Teaching for doctrines the commandments of men," and making "Void the commandments of God," by &s;uch vain tra|ditions. For, &s;uch directions as the&s;e, which can be obeyed without, and <HI>only</HI> without repent|ance, are not found in the word of God. The&s;e commands to impenitent doings, on account of inability to repent and believe <HI>now,</HI> are taught <HI>only</HI> by the "Precepts of men;" and they do not hang on tho&s;e two commands, of love to God, and our neighbor; as do all the com|mands in the law, and the prophets.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mat. xxii. 40.</NOTE> For the&s;e directions, which we are &s;peaking again&s;t, are to be performed <HI>without</HI> love, <HI>without</HI> repentance and faith; on account of &s;ome inability in &s;in|ners, to love and believe immediately. And is
<PB N="35" REF="034258_0035_0FFC3C8E8719EAB8">
it not mo&s;t evident that &s;uch preaching has a direct tendency to confirm &s;inners in a belief, that their inability is not their crime, but does really excu&s;e them from obligation to repent and obey the go&s;pel, as &s;oon as they hear it, or with|out delay? In this view, and in this only, are impenitent &s;inners plea&s;ed with &s;uch directions. For they feel, and they know, that all directions to impenitent prayers and doings, are founded on their inability to be holy <HI>now,</HI> and have a di|rect tendency to keep their obligation to immed|iate repentance and faith out of view; and do confirm them in their vain excu&s;e.</P>
<P>Such preaching therefore, has no tendency to awaken, convict, and convert &s;inners; but di|rectly the rever&s;e. It tends to &s;trip the minds of &s;inners, of all true conviction of their &s;inful|ne&s;s; and to &s;trengthen the "Hands of the wick|ed, that he &s;hould not return from his wicked way."<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Ezek. xiii. 22.</NOTE> It tends to confirm &s;inners in a belief, that they are able and willing to do their duty, and that in &s;ome good mea&s;ure they perform it, even while they are unable to repent and believe the go&s;pel. And thus, &s;inners are encouraged in believing a lie, that they can plea&s;e God, and have their prayers heard and an&s;wered without faith. And al&s;o, by &s;uch preaching, men are en|couraged to go about to e&s;tabli&s;h their own right|eou&s;ne&s;s, until they drop into hell. And &s;o long as &s;inners believe &s;uch preaching as this, it is impo&s;&s;ible for them to feel their need of the atonement and interce&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t, or the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of praying by faith in his name, in order to
<PB REF="034258_0036_0FFC3C8B8C0F6AE8">
have their prayers heard, and graciou&s;ly an&s;wer|ed for his &s;ake. For certainly, impenitent, unbe|lieving &s;inners do not pray in the name of Chri&s;t, to whom they will not come. And if, neverthe|le&s;s, they can have their prayers heard, and a gracious an&s;wer to them, even with the gift of repentance and faith; then Chri&s;t is dead in vain, and his interce&s;&s;ion is of no value. There|fore, all &s;uch directions to any prayers, or to any doings, otherwi&s;e than in the exerci&s;e of faith, and all encouragement that &s;uch faithle&s;s prayers will meet with acceptance, and a gra|cious an&s;wer from God, are directly again&s;t Chri&s;t, and tend to de&s;troy his kingdom and the &s;ouls of men. But, you will a&s;k; mu&s;t not im|penitent &s;inners be directed to pray? They cer|tainly mu&s;t. "I will that men pray every where;" that is, all men &s;hould pray. But how? "Lifting up holy hands without wrath and doubting." "Repent"&mdash;"and pray," &s;ays Peter, to Simon the &s;orcerer, who was in the bonds of iniquity. And there is no &s;uch thing as praying in truth and reality, or according to directions in &s;cripture, but in the exerci&s;e of true repentance and faith. And as the &s;criptures di|rect &s;inners to make no other prayers than &s;uch as are of faith; &s;o, it gives no encouragement that any other prayers will be heard and accept|ed of God. "If I regard iniquity in my heart," as all impenitent &s;inners do, "The Lord will not hear me." "But let him a&s;k in faith, nothing wavering," or doubting. And he who does not thus a&s;k in faith, "Let not that man think that he &s;hall receive any thing of the Lord."</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="034258_0037_0FFC3C8939619EF8">Thus, "<HI>The end of the commandment,</HI>" even of all the commandments in the law and prophets, whether to pray or to do any other thing, "<HI>is cha|rity,</HI>" or love.

<P>And thus, all the prophets, apo&s;tles, and faithful mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t; "They went out and preached that men &s;hould repent."

He &s;ays, "Ye have not cho|&s;en me, but I have cho&s;en you, and ordained you, that you &s;hould go, and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit &s;hould remain." How then can any expect to be &s;aved, unle&s;s they are fir&s;t cho|&s;en by Chri&s;t, &s;ince they have not cho&s;en him? And, if &s;inners are fir&s;t cho&s;en by, and in Chri&s;t,

they were "Cho&s;en in him before the foundation of the world." But, "If I am not one of the elect, then I cannot be &s;aved." No, if you will not choo&s;e Chri&s;t, nor come to him; and, if he has not cho&s;en you, there can be no hope. If all &s;inners refu&s;e, and none have cho&s;en Chri&s;t, nor ever will come to him except the Father draw them, then all the hope there is, that any will ever come, and be &s;aved, is from God's eternal, electing love, by which he has determined to draw and &s;ave &s;ome.

<PB N="42" REF="034258_0042_0FFC3C7CA92B98B8">
him&s;elf enquire in the words of the Apo&s;tle, "Who maketh" me "To differ?" and you may each one an&s;wer, with the &s;ame Apo&s;tle, "By the grace of God I am what I am." You may a&s;cribe it all to &s;overeign grace. God &s;ays by his Prophet: "I have loved thee with an ever|la&s;ting love, therefore with loving kindne&s;s have I drawn thee." You love him, and come to Chri&s;t, becau&s;e he fir&s;t loved you; as he did Ja|cob, with an eternal, electing love: or, "Ac|cording to the election of grace." "By grace are ye &s;aved, through faith, and that not of your|&s;elves, it is the gift of God. Not of works, left any man &s;hould boa&s;t." You have nothing to boa&s;t of, except the grace of God, which alone has made you to differ from others, and kindly drawn you home to God, in Chri&s;t, by bowing your &s;tubborn will. In the day of God's gra|cious power; you have become his willing peo|ple, and actually come to Chri&s;t, to his glorious fea&s;t of go&s;pel grace.</P>
<P>Therefore, be humble, and learn to pity others, who yet remain unwilling, and boa&s;t not again&s;t them. And if they &s;trive again&s;t that election of grace, which you now believe in, and which hath made you to differ; then remember, that you mu&s;t not &s;trive with them. "The &s;er|vant of the Lord mu&s;t not &s;trive, but be gentle; in meekne&s;s in&s;tructing tho&s;e that oppo&s;e them|&s;elves, if God peradventure will give them re|pentance, to the acknowledgment of the truth."</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> Let &s;uch as yet remain unwilling, and cannot come to Chri&s;t, accept the word of exhortation.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="034258_0043_0FFC3C7955452CD8">You have heard what is implied in coming to Chri&s;t; and the rea&s;on why "No man can come except the Father draw him;" and the remark which have been made on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Let us now pray, and be&s;eech you, and "As tho God did be&s;eech you by us, we pray you in Chri&s;t's &s;tead," &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider, and lay the&s;e things to heart, and to be "Reconcil|ed to God," in coming to Chri&s;t his Son. Be entreated to enquire, like the noble Bereans, "Whether the&s;e things are &s;o." For, if indeed they are &s;o, then tho&s;e, who cannot come to Chri&s;t, are involved in the mo&s;t dreadful and ruined &s;tate and condition. They cannot come to Chri&s;t, becau&s;e of a &s;tubborn will, which ren|ders them as wicked as devils. And although our not coming to Chri&s;t is by rea&s;on of a rebel|lious will, which renders us as full of &s;in as the devils; yet we a&s;k, why are we to blame? Thus you plead the greatne&s;s, and &s;trength of your wickedne&s;s as an excu&s;e, and argument, that you are not blame-worthy. Yet you are creatures, wholly dependent on God, and in every re&s;pect under obligations to him, and to his law; which like him&s;elf, is holy, ju&s;t, and good: And which binds all creatures to love him &s;upremely; and cur&s;es every one that continues not in all things written in the book of the law to do them."</P>
<P>Yet, know O &s;inners, who cannot come to Chri&s;t, that your carnal minds are enmity again&s;t this glorious God; they are not &s;ubject to his law, neither indeed <HI>can be.</HI> And your carnal minds render you &s;o &s;tubborn and rebellious, that when Chri&s;t has come, and in obedience to this
<PB N="44" REF="034258_0044_0FFC3C77CD3009A0">
holy law of God, rendered him&s;elf a proper object of your love and choice; yet, you hate both him, and his Father, to &s;uch a degree, that you will not come to him, except the Fath|er draw you, by his Almighty power, in &s;ubduing your will. Yet you &s;ay, why am I to blame? But I a&s;k, why are you not to blame, or blame-worthy? Your own con&s;ciences tell you, as well as the &s;criptures, that your inability to repent and come to Chri&s;t, is not &s;uch as to render you excu&s;able for not coming.</P>
<P>It is not want of natural power, as we have &s;een; for this would excu&s;e you. It is not becau&s;e Chri&s;t is not a pro|per object of love; for he is altogether lovely. If he were not, you would be blamele&s;s in not receiving him.</P>
<P>Your inability is not want of evidence to ground your &s;aith and love upon. It is not want of conviction of con&s;ci|ence of the truth of tho&s;e things you are required to believe, or that Chri&s;t is thus a proper object of love. For your con|&s;ciences tell you that he is, and that his te&s;timony is true. It is not want of motives, or arguments, to per&s;uade you, even the mo&s;t powerful motives, that you do not come to Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>It is not becau&s;e that &s;atan overpowers you, &s;o as to lead you to pur&s;ue after the riches, honors, and plea&s;ures of the world contrary to your wills. If &s;o you are not blame-wor|thy. But you are willing captives to &s;atan, the God of this world. Your inability is not becau&s;e there is more plea&s;ure and happine&s;s in the &s;ervice of &s;in and &s;atan, than in the &s;er|vice of God. For your con&s;ciences tell you, as do the &s;crip|tures al&s;o, that Wi&s;dom's ways are ways of plea&s;antne&s;s; <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> that in "Keeping God's commands there is great reward." But, in &s;in, "Even in laughter the heart is &s;orrowful." Nei|ther is your inability found in the unwillingne&s;s of Chri&s;t to receive you, even all who are willing to come to him. But, it is found only in your own unwillingne&s;s to come to him&mdash; it is found only in &s;inners, and in tho&s;e who are full of evil, nothing but &s;in, in whom "Dwells no good thing." "And ye will not come to me that ye might have life." "He is de&s;pi&s;ed and rejected of men." "And when we &s;hall &s;ee him, there is no beauty in him that we &s;hould de&s;ire him."</P>
<P>And now, is not this the real, and only inability of &s;in|ners in coming to Chri&s;t? If &s;o, why are they not to be blamed? And where can blame be found, if not in tho&s;e who are &s;o full of contempt, and hatred again&s;t Chri&s;t, the be&s;t of beings, that they will not receive him, and <HI>cannot</HI> come to him, by rea&s;on of unwillingne&s;s; not ever be made willing, but by a new creation, by the drawing of the Father&punc;</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="034258_0045_0FFC3C75526BCA30">Be per&s;uaded then to receive conviction, that the ina|bility of &s;inners to repent, believe, and come to Chri&s;t by love, is found only in their own &s;inful and perver&s;e wills. By this, they not only refu&s;e Chri&s;t, "And have not cho&s;en him," but even hate the doctrine, that he has cho&s;en them; or that God has di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;ome of mankind from others, by <HI>eternal election.</HI> Thus &s;inners, in their di&s;traction, not only neglect the great &s;alvation; but they hate that doctrine of God's electing love, by which he has determined to make &s;ome willing to enjoy it, and which affords the only ground to hope, that the inability of any one will ever be removed; or that any will ever come to Chri&s;t and be &s;aved. And all tho&s;e, who cannot come to Chri&s;t, or have not cho&s;en him, will be equally oppo&s;ed to his choo&s;ing them; that is, to the doctrine of election by grace. But, &s;ays the objector, you have mi&s;taken our meaning. We do not object again&s;t God's choo&s;ing &s;ome to &s;alvation; but that he &s;hould choo&s;e a part, and not the whole. This looks like partiality; and makes God a re&s;pec|ter of per&s;ons. An&s;wer. This objection &s;hows your hearts very plainly; and makes it evident, that all oppo&s;ition to particular and per&s;onal election, is founded in a belief of the doctrine of univer&s;al &s;alvation&mdash;that God will, or ought to &s;ave all men: And that if God has determined to &s;ave but a "remnant, according to the election of grace;" this, makes him a re&s;pecter of per&s;ons, and is derogatory to his charac|ter. Hence, it is often &s;aid, I had rather be an univer&s;ali&s;t, than to believe the doctrine of particular, and per&s;onal election.</P>
<P>And indeed, you are an univer&s;ali&s;t, if you do not be|lieve in particular election. For certainly, God has prede|termined to &s;ave a part, and only a part of mankind; or el&s;e the whole. And it is impo&s;&s;ible to oppo&s;e the doctrine of per|&s;onal election, but only in a belief of univer&s;al &s;alvation&mdash; that God will, or ought to &s;ave, not a remnant only, but the whole of mankind. Hence it is, that the &s;ame texts of Scripture are commonly urged again&s;t particular election, which the univer&s;ali&s;ts improve to &s;upport the doctrine of univer&s;al &s;alvation, viz. &s;uch as the&s;e: "As I live, &s;aith the Lord God, I have no plea&s;ure in the death of the wicked." And again: "Who will have all men to be &s;aved, and come to the knowledge of the truth," &amp;c. Yet, in perfect con&s;i&s;t|ance with the&s;e, and all other pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, God &s;ays, "Altho the number of the children of I&s;rael be as the &s;and of
<PB N="46" REF="034258_0046_0FFC3C73A1C2F5A8">
the &s;ea, yet a remnant &s;hall be &s;aved." "And even at this pre&s;ent time al&s;o, there is a remnant according to the election of grace." And "Many are called, but few cho&s;en." And in all this, "I perceive that God is no re&s;pecter of per|&s;ons: But in every nation, he that feareth God, and worketh righteou&s;ne&s;s is accepted of him." Thus the doctrine of elec|tion &s;till appears to be &s;criptural and good, and all oppo&s;ition to it involves the doctrine of univer&s;al &s;alvation. For, if <HI>election</HI> be true; then, the doctrine of univer&s;al &s;alvation is not. And we oppo&s;e the fir&s;t, <HI>only</HI> to e&s;tabli&s;h the &s;econd.</P>
<P>But, &s;ome may &s;till object, and &s;ay; if this doctrine be true, then, if I am not elected, I cannot be &s;aved, although I &s;hould do well, and live a good and holy life, and commit no &s;in all my days: And if I am elected I &s;hall be &s;aved, let me do what I will, or if I do nothing.</P>
<P>An&s;wer. If you thus live a good and holy life &amp; com|mit no &s;in; but "Fear God and work righteou&s;ne&s;s," then you will be accepted of him; and want of election will not exclude you from &s;alvation. For, by the&s;e holy exerci&s;es and for&s;aking &s;in, you will come to Chri&s;t; and hereby make your calling and election &s;ure. But, the&s;e good works you will never do, unle&s;s God has "Before ordained, that you &s;hould walk in them," and thus draws you by his "Everla&s;t|ing" and electing love. And if you do nothing, or do not walk in the&s;e good works, then you cannot make your calling and election &s;ure; nor ever be &s;aved. For "He that be|lieveth &s;hall be &s;aved, but he that believeth not &s;hall be damn|ed." And he that doeth nothing, will be damned al&s;o: For &s;uch an one does not believe, and cannot come to Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>But, you will &s;ay, we do not yet &s;ee the propriety of u&s;ing the word <HI>cannot,</HI> to expre&s;s unwillingne&s;s, and blame.</P>
<P>An&s;wer. If holy beings "<HI>cannot do evil,</HI>" becau&s;e they <HI>are holy</HI>; then, it is equally proper to &s;ay, that <HI>unholy</HI> be|ings cannot do good becau&s;e they are unholy &amp; blame-worthy.</P>
<P>If it be expre&s;&s;ive of the infinite holine&s;s and perfection of God, that he "<HI>cannot lie</HI>" and it be <HI>impo&s;&s;ible for God to lie;</HI> then it is equally expre&s;&s;ive of the highe&s;t degree of wicked|ne&s;s in men, that they <HI>cannot</HI> &s;peak the truth, nor love the truth; or that they <HI>cannot come to Chri&s;t,</HI> who is "the <HI>way,</HI> the <HI>truth,</HI> and the <HI>life.</HI>" And if he, who is born of God <HI>&s;inneth not,</HI> &amp; he <HI>cannot &s;in,</HI> becau&s;e he is born of God; and if this <HI>cannot</HI> is expre&s;&s;ive of an <HI>holy, virtuous,</HI> and prai&s;e-wor|thy character; then, it is equally expre&s;&s;ive of a totally &s;in|ful
<PB N="47" REF="034258_0047_0FFC3C7218CD3288">
character, when it is &s;aid, the wicked "<HI>cannot cea&s;e from &s;in,</HI>" and <HI>cannot</HI> come to Chri&s;t, who will &s;ave them from their &s;ins. For, they love their &s;ins, &s;o that they cannot for&s;ake them. And they hate Chri&s;t, &s;o that they <HI>cannot come to him.</HI></P>
<P>Truly, "Ye cannot &s;erve the Lord." But why? "For he is an holy God," and ye are unholy. If ye were not, ye could, and ye would &s;erve the Lord, and come unto Chri&s;t. You cannot come to him, receive him, nor love him, becau&s;e he is "holy, harmle&s;s, and undefiled; &s;eparate from &s;inners." But you are unholy, defiled, &s;eparated <HI>from</HI> Chri&s;t, <HI>with</HI> &s;in|ners; and <HI>only by &s;in.</HI></P>
<P>"Behold, their ear is uncircumci&s;ed, and they <HI>cannot</HI> hearken." But why? "Behold, the word of the Lord is unto them a reproach; they have no delight in it. He feed|eth of a&s;hes; a deceived heart hath turned him a&s;ide, &s;o that he <HI>cannot</HI> deliver his own &s;oul, nor &s;ay, is there not a lie in my right hand?" "Ye &s;tiff-necked, and uncircumci&s;ed in heart and ears; ye do always re&s;i&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t; as your fathers did, &s;o do ye." Why then will you any longer plead <HI>not guilty</HI>? And &s;ay if I <HI>cannot</HI> come to Chri&s;t, why am I blamed? Do you not &s;ee, that God views you altogether &s;inful, and blame worthy, that you cannot &s;erve the Lord, that you cannot hearken, that you cannot deliver your own &s;ouls; and that you cannot come to Chri&s;t? All this inability is contained in a deceived heart, which hath turned you a&s;ide, &s;o that you cannot deliver your own &s;ouls, nor &s;ay, is there not a lie in my right hand? You cannot come to Chri&s;t, be|cau&s;e you are &s;tiff necked, and uncircumci&s;ed in heart, and ears; and hereby ye do always re&s;i&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t, and will not come to Chri&s;t. Ye cannot, ye will not come, be|cau&s;e you are earthly, &s;en&s;ual, devili&s;h. In this view of ina|bility, how is it po&s;&s;ible for any to &s;ay, "I am not polluted," I have not &s;inned; when this totally &s;inful character contains all our inability; and is the whole rea&s;on on our part, why we cannot this day leave our &s;ins, and come to Chri&s;t by faith. And in this view, we &s;ee the propriety of Chri&s;t's looking round on the unbelieving Jews, with anger; being grieved for the hardne&s;s of their hearts: And that God &s;hould be "angry with the wicked every day;" and threaten them with everla&s;ting de&s;truction for unbelief. Your inability is ju&s;t the &s;ame as that of the Jews. They could not come to Chri&s;t; they would not receive him. "He came to his own, and his own received him not." And, becau&s;e they could
<PB N="48" REF="034258_0048_0FFC3C709156E760">
not receive him, the things of their peace are now hidden from their eyes; and they are going down to de&s;truction, from one generation to another, continually. All this is come upon them, becau&s;e, when Chri&s;t would have gathered them, &amp; &s;aved them, they would not. "Ye will not come to me, that ye might have life." This had a primary reference to the Jews, altho it is equally true of all men, both Jews, and Gentiles, who are under &s;in. "No man can," becau&s;e no man will, "Come to me, except the Father, which hath &s;ent me, draw him." Now therefore, let us all receive con|viction, that our inability to be holy, to for&s;ake our &s;ins, and come to chri&s;t by faith, centers in a rebellious will, and makes it evident that all, who cannot come to him, by faith and love, are "Without excu&s;e;" and "Have no cloak for their &s;in." And as you have heard what it is to come unto Chri&s;t; let all be exhorted, and per&s;uaded to accept of his kind invitations, and come unto him: For he &s;ays, "Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and ye &s;hall find re&s;t to your &s;ouls." "And the &s;pirit and the bride &s;ay come. And let him that heareth, &s;ay come. And let him that is athir&s;t come. And who&s;oever will, let him take the water of life freely." And who&s;oever "Cannot come," and does not accept of this moving invitation, let him know &amp; be a&s;&s;ured, &amp; remember, that he is of that number who are characteri&s;ed in our text, as unwilling, rebellions, and &s;elf-de&s;troying &s;inners. "And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life." "They would not come." And there|fore, <HI>I cannot come.</HI></P>
