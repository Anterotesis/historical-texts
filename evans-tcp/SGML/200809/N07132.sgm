<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>GENESIS XXII. 18.</BIBL>
<P>"AND in thy &s;eed &s;hall all nations of the earth be ble&s;&s;ed."&mdash;</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THESE words, with the im|mediately foregoing ones, exhibit an account of the promi&s;e which God made, more than three thou&s;and years ago, to the memo|rable Patriarch, who is &s;et forth as a pat|tern of faith to all after-generations of men: And it &s;ummarily contains the whole &s;cheme of the divine conduct, re|&s;pecting both the nation of the Jews, and the other nations of the earth.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="009088_0012_1030328802D4EA20">IT is obviou&s;ly divi&s;ible into two parts. The former relates to Abraham him&s;elf, and his natural po&s;terity thro' I&s;aac and Jacob; and may ju&s;tly be e|&s;teemed the true ba&s;is of the Jewi&s;h church, and of all the means, privileges, dignities and prerogatives, they were favoured with, di&s;tingui&s;hing them from every other people. The latter re&s;pects the nations in common; pointing our view to Chri&s;t, and to the enlargement of God's kingdom under his admini&s;tration, when there &s;hould be no more any difference between "Jew and Greek," but all kindreds, lan|guages and people under the whole hea|ven, upon their faith in the promi&s;ed &s;eed, &s;hould make one body, be fellow|heirs, and partakers in common of the &s;ame go&s;pel-&s;alvation.</P>
<P>THIS latter part of the promi&s;e, which concerns the nations of the world in ge|neral, is comprehended in the words I have &s;elected to employ our thoughts at this time,
<Q>In thy &s;eed &s;hall all nations of the earth be ble&s;&s;ed.</Q>
An intere&s;ting promi&s;e! No one in the &s;acred books is more &s;o. It was accordingly, upon &s;e|veral occa&s;ions be&s;ides that in my con|text, expre&s;sly made to Abraham by name;
<PB N="3" REF="009088_0013_10311BC330E05828">
and afterwards, in like explicit form, re|newed both to I&s;aac and Jacob: Nor is there a promi&s;e of God more frequently refered to by the in&s;pired writers. This is the promi&s;e, in &s;pecial, which the a|po&s;tle Paul &s;o often takes ri&s;e from in his rea&s;onings, particularly, in favor of the Gentile nations.</P>
<P>WHAT I have in view, at pre&s;ent, is to let you into a clear conception of the meaning, importance and extent of this divine promi&s;e; the doing of which will very obviou&s;ly prepare the way for the reflections that are proper upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion as this.</P>
<P>THE following things then are to be con&s;idered and explained, the <HI>&s;eed</HI> in whom this promi&s;e is made; the ju&s;t import of the <HI>ble&s;&s;ing</HI> promi&s;ed; and final|ly, the <HI>extent</HI> of the object of the promi&s;e.</P>
<P>AS to the fir&s;t of the&s;e particulars, the <HI>&s;eed</HI> in whom the promi&s;e is made, 'tis evident we are to under&s;tand by it, not the po&s;terity of Abraham in general, ei|ther by I&s;aac or Jacob; but a SINGLE PERSON proceeding from him thro' them. The word "&s;eed" is not u&s;ed here as a
<PB N="4" REF="009088_0014_10311BC4B975D2D8">
name of multitude; but as denoting ONE, by whom, as de&s;cending from Abraham, the ble&s;&s;ing &s;hould be conveyed. Thus the promi&s;e &s;eems to have been under|&s;tood by Abraham him&s;elf. How el&s;e &s;hall we explain that addre&s;s of our Lord to the Jews, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John VIII.56.</NOTE> "Your father Abraham rejoiced to &s;ee my day, and &s;aw it, and was glad?" It was in the lively exerci&s;e of faith and hope, as grounded on the "&s;eed" promi&s;ed in my text, that he was filled with holy joy, while he looked for|ward to the time, when this glorious Sa|viour would appear in the world to be a ble&s;&s;ing to it. And this &s;ame promi&s;ed "&s;eed" was ultimately the ground of the univer&s;al expectation there was among the Jews, particularly about the time of our Saviour's manife&s;tation in human fle&s;h, that a "deliverer would come out of Zion," as proceeding from Abraham.&mdash; They entertain'd, 'tis true, wrong noti|ons of this deliverer, and of the &s;alvation he would effect: But they rightly con|&s;trued the promi&s;e &s;o far as they were led, in virtue of it, to expect, that &s;ome extraordinary per&s;on would, in God's time, come into the world under the character of a mighty Redeemer. To be &s;ure, this is the con&s;truction the new-te&s;|tament-writers
<PB N="5" REF="009088_0015_10311BC733605BE8">
put upon the word, "&s;eed," in the promi&s;e to Abraham. The apo&s;tle Paul, while treating upon this matter ex profe&s;&s;o, has thus explained the term in Gal. 3.16. His words are, "He &s;aith not," that is, God, in the promi&s;es he made to Abraham, &s;aith not, "and to &s;eeds, as of many; but as of one, to thy &s;eed; which &s;eed (as he goes on to a&s;&s;ure us) is Chri&s;t." He accordingly, in the following 19th v. u&s;es the word, &s;eed, in this per&s;onal &s;en&s;e. For, &s;peaking there of the law that was given by Mo&s;es, he &s;ays, "it was added becau&s;e of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, till the &s;eed &s;hould come," that is, till the appearing of Chri&s;t, the &s;eed it was promi&s;ed &s;hould come. In agreement with this interpre|tation, Chri&s;t is repre&s;ented <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heb. II.16.</NOTE> as having "took on him the &s;eed of Abraham."&mdash; And his birth into the world is &s;poken of <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Luke I.75.</NOTE> as "the mercy promi&s;ed in the cove|nant, the oath which God &s;ware to A|braham," that is, the promi&s;e he &s;olemn|ly made to him, and confirmed by his oath, in the words of my text. The &s;hort of the matter is, the &s;eed here promi&s;ed to Abraham is the &s;ame &s;eed that was pro|mi&s;ed to Adam &s;oon after his fall; meaning Chri&s;t, the Saviour it plea&s;ed the all-mer|ciful God early to provide for a peri&s;hing
<PB N="6" REF="009088_0016_10311BCB8A889FF0">
world, thro' whom alone any of the race of men could be delivered from &s;in and wrath, and obtain &s;alvation with eternal glory. And 'tis accordingly the truth of fact, that Chri&s;t is the glorious per&s;on, to who&s;e mediatory undertaking, in our nature, it is every where a&s;cribed, in the in&s;pired writings of the new-te&s;tament, "that the &s;erpent's head has been brui&s;ed;" or, what means preci&s;ely the &s;ame thing, that "the nations of the earth" have been, and "&s;hall be ble&s;&s;ed."</P>
<P>THUS the "&s;eed," promi&s;ed in my text, means a &s;ingle per&s;on, one only, even Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the alone con&s;tituted &s;aviour of men; and &s;o I gone on, as was nextly propo&s;ed,</P>
<P>TO a&s;certain the &s;en&s;e in which we are to under&s;tand the <HI>ble&s;&s;ing</HI> that is promi&s;ed thro' him.</P>
<P>AND it means, without all doubt, the &s;ame thing with go&s;pel-&s;alvation. Abraham entertained this thought of it. I don't &s;ay, that he had &s;o full and di&s;tinct an idea of the &s;alvation by Chri&s;t as we have, who&s;e lot it is to live in the world &s;ince the incarnation of the &s;on of God,
<PB N="7" REF="009088_0017_10311BCD1209F738">
and the clear di&s;covery he has made of the coun&s;els of heaven with reference to the great affair of man's redemption, as grounded on the merit of his life and death: But he was led, in con&s;equence of this promi&s;e, into an expectation of good things far more excellent than temporal ones, and as de&s;igned for other nations be&s;ides the Jewi&s;h, who could boa&s;t of having him for their head and father ac|cording to the fle&s;h. Hence our Saviour &s;peaks of him <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">John VIII.56.</NOTE> as having by faith, "&s;een his day," the day of his appearing, the go&s;|pel day. And hence the author of the epi|&s;tle to the Hebrews declares, <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heb. IX.10.</NOTE> that Abra|ham "looked for a city which hath foun|dations, who&s;e builder and maker is God." The &s;ame city is here meant which the apo&s;tle John calls "the new Jeru&s;alem," and &s;aw in his vi&s;ions, "coming down from God out of heaven." Nor could Abraham have looked for &s;uch a city as this in any way but that of faith, taking ri&s;e from the promi&s;e God had now made to him.</P>
<P>AND 'tis abundantly evident, that the new-te&s;tament writings do every where under&s;tand this BLESSING, which was to be conveyed thro' the &s;eed of Abraham,
<PB N="8" REF="009088_0018_10311BCE96BC28F0">
in the above &s;piritual &s;en&s;e. Hence Zacharias, in his prophetic &s;ong, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke I. 69th to the 75th.</NOTE> makes "God's granting to us to &s;erve him in holine&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s" one thing in|cluded in "the mercy promi&s;ed in the covenant with Abraham." Hence the apo&s;tle Peter tells the Jews, <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Acts III.25.26.</NOTE> that "the mi&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t to ble&s;s them by turning them from their iniquities," was compre|hended in tho&s;e words of God to Abra|ham of old, "in thy &s;eed &s;hall all the kin|dreds of the earth be ble&s;&s;ed." Hence the apo&s;tle Paul declares, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gal. III.8.</NOTE> that "the go&s;pel was preached to Abraham," when it was &s;aid to him, "in thee &s;hall all nations be ble&s;&s;ed;" and again, <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">v. 18.</NOTE> that "the inheri|tance," the incorruptible, undefiled and eternal inheritance, as it is &s;ometimes cal|led, was "given to Abraham by promi&s;e," that is, the promi&s;e in my text. Hence the author of the epi&s;tle to the Hebrews &s;peaks of God <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Heb. IX.16.</NOTE> as "not a&s;hamed to be called their God," the God of Abraham, of I&s;aac, and of Jacob, "becau&s;e he hath prepared for them a city," the &s;ame city of which he had before <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">v. 10.</NOTE> &s;aid, "who&s;e builder and maker is God." In fine, it was becau&s;e this, and the &s;imilar promi&s;es, looked beyond the pre&s;ent world, enga|ging
<PB N="9" REF="009088_0019_10311BD12B4299A8">
ble&s;&s;edne&s;s in &s;ome future one, that our Saviour argues therefrom in proof of the re&s;urrection from the dead. His words are, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke XX 37.</NOTE> "that the dead &s;hall be rai|&s;ed, even Mo&s;es &s;hewed at the bu&s;h, when he called the Lord, the God of Abraham, and the God of I&s;aac, and the God of Jacob. For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living." 'Tis certain, from the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, if we may rely on the au|thority of the new-te&s;tament writers, that the <HI>ble&s;&s;ing</HI> promi&s;ed through the &s;eed of Abraham was virtually, &s;eminally and implicitly, that &s;ame &s;alvation which has &s;ince, as the apo&s;tle Paul &s;peaks, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. XVI.26.</NOTE> "been made known, according to the command|ment of the everla&s;ting God, to all nations for the obedience of faith."</P>
<P>BUT be&s;ides this &s;alvation, wherein the ble&s;&s;ing promi&s;ed principally con&s;i&s;ts, the way and means of its be&s;towment are included al&s;o; &s;uch as the manife&s;tation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t in our fle&s;h, as proceeding from Abraham; his &s;ufferings and death; his re&s;urrection from the dead; a&s;cention to heaven, and exaltation at the right hand of God; and that &s;ettlement of God's vi&s;ible kingdom, in con&s;equence hereof, which now takes place in the world, with
<PB N="10" REF="009088_0020_10311BD4904BC890">
him at it's head. Not that Abraham, or any of his po&s;terity in former ages, were led, by the&s;e general words, "in thy &s;eed &s;hall all nations be ble&s;&s;ed," into a parti|cular knowledge of the&s;e things. 'Tis probable, neither he, nor they, under|&s;tood any more by them than this, that &s;ome glorious per&s;onage, &s;pringing from him, &s;hould, in God's time, in ways un|tho't of by them, be the in&s;trument in &s;piritually "ble&s;&s;ing all nations of the earth." But &s;till, the whole work of Chri&s;t, as Saviour of the world, was virtu|ally contained in this promi&s;e, that is to &s;ay, all that he was to be, to do, and to &s;uffer, while on earth; and, all that he was afterwards to tran&s;act in heaven, in order to his bringing into effect the de|&s;ign of his mediatory undertaking for &s;in|ners. The in&s;pired writers certainly teach us to conceive thus of the matter. Hence they &s;peak of the incarnation of Chri&s;t, which was an e&s;&s;ential preparative in the plan of God in order to the &s;alvation of men, as an accompli&s;hment, in part, of this ble&s;&s;ing promi&s;ed in the covenant with Abraham. Thus Mary, the mother of our Lord, is introduced in her prophe|tic &s;ong. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke I.54, 55.</NOTE> as "rejoicing in God" upon his birth into the world, and for this &s;pe|cial
<PB N="11" REF="009088_0021_10311BD75C040EE0">
rea&s;on, "becau&s;e he had helped his &s;ervant I&s;rael, in remembrance of his mer|cy, as he &s;pake to our fathers, to Abra|ham, and to his &s;eed forever." And Ze|charias, upon this &s;ame occa&s;ion, being "filled with the Holy Gho&s;t" is brought in opening his lips in tho&s;e words of prai&s;e, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Luke I.6<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">, 72, 73.</NOTE> "ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord God of I&s;rael, for he hath vi&s;ited and redeemed his people, and rai&s;ed up an horn of &s;alvation for us, in the hou&s;e of his &s;ervant David,&mdash;to perform the mercy promi&s;ed to our fa|thers, and to remember his holy covenant, the oath which he &s;wear to our father Abraham." And as the incarnation of Chri&s;t, &s;o his obedience in our nature even to the death of the cro&s;s, which ought always to be e&s;teemed the true and only moral ground of the be&s;towment of &s;piritual and heavenly ble&s;&s;ings, is parti|cularly and expre&s;sly repre&s;ented as that by which al&s;o the promi&s;e to Abraham was in part fulfilled. Hence that pa&s;&s;age in the apo&s;tle Paul's epi&s;tle to the Gala|tions, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gal. III.13, 14.</NOTE> "Chri&s;t hath redeemed us from the cur&s;e of the law, being made a cur&s;e for us, &mdash; that the ble&s;&s;ing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t." In like manner, the re&s;urrection of our Lord, the fir&s;t &s;tep to his exalted
<PB N="12" REF="009088_0022_10311BD8E2F975F0">
&s;tate in heaven, and &s;ometimes put in &s;cripture for the whole of it, is directly mentioned as effected to make good the promi&s;e to Abraham. Hence tho&s;e words in Paul's &s;peech to the men of Antioch, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts XIII. 32, 33.</NOTE> "We declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promi&s;e, which was made unto the fathers, God hath fulfilled the &s;ame unto us their children, in that he hath rai&s;ed up Je&s;us again." In fine, that ad|vantageous &s;tate of things, under the go&s;pel-di&s;pen&s;ation, which was &s;et up by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and has him for its &s;upreme director and Lord, was likewi&s;e included in this promi&s;e: So tho't the great apo&s;tle of the Gentiles; for one of the main things he had in view, e&s;pecially in his epi&s;tles to the Romans, Galatians, and Ephe&s;ians, was to illu&s;trate and prove this point.</P>

Such an interpre|tation would be contrary to the truth of fact, as well as &s;cripture: But the mean|ing is, that in Chri&s;t, the promi&s;ed &s;eed, there is no difference between Jew and Gentile; between one nation and ano|ther; but in every nation under the whole heaven, whoe&s;over believe in the only begotten Son of God, they are "heirs of the promi&s;e, and &s;hall be &s;avingly "ble&s;&s;ed with faithful Abraham."</P>

<P>THE Jewi&s;h nation, 'tis true, were to have the precedence. The go&s;pel was fir&s;t to be preached to them; but not to the exclu&s;ion of the other nations. They al&s;o were comprehended, yea, expre&s;sly mentioned, in the promi&s;e to Abraham: And, in fulfilment of this promi&s;e, the go&s;pel ought to be, and actually was, preached to them. A &s;pecimen of this we meet with immediately upon the Spi|rit's being poured out upon the apo&s;tles on the day of Penteco&s;t; for "devout men, out of every nation under heaven," being now at Jeru&s;alem, the "ble&s;&s;ing," contained in the "promi&s;e to Abraham," was offered to them in the name of Je&s;us

Chri&s;t. And it is evident, from the preaching, e&s;pecially of the apo&s;tle Paul, that no di&s;tinction was made between one nation and another, between one man and another; but in all places, and to all per&s;ons, as there was opportunity, the way to &s;alvation by Je&s;us Chri&s;t was impartially made known.</P>
<P>THE language, in which the <HI>actually ble&s;&s;ed</HI> by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the promi&s;ed &s;eed, are &s;poken of in &s;cripture, is a further ob|&s;ervable proof, that the nations, in all cor|ners of the earth, in all ages, without di&s;|tinction or limitation, are the object of the promi&s;e in my text. They are intro|duced in the book of the Revelation,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev.

And no wonder this is the repre&s;entation; for the "ble&s;&s;ed in Je&s;us Chri&s;t," in the coming &s;tate, will be a collection of all &s;orts and conditions of men, out of all nations, in all parts and ages of the world, even from the days of Adam, till time &s;hall be no more. It is accordingly to be remarked here, the "ble&s;&s;ing" promi&s;ed to "all nations" looks backwards as well as forwards; ta|king in all believers, like Abraham, from the beginning of the world to that day, as well as from that day to the end of the world.

<P>I HAVE now &s;aid what may be tho't &s;ufficient to illu&s;trate the promi&s;e in my text. It remains to make what has been offered u&s;eful, by calling your attention to &s;ome &s;uitable reflections. And,</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t thing obviou&s;ly perceivable is, that the ble&s;&s;ing mankind in Je&s;us Chri&s;t was the aim of God, and what he has been pro&s;ecuting, all along from the beginning of the world. This was at fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;ted only in general promi&s;es and predictions, and the&s;e &s;o worded as that Adam, Abraham, Mo&s;es, David, and the Prophets, had not a clear and comprehen|&s;ive under&s;tanding of the things virtually and really intended by them. And, per|haps, it would not have con&s;i&s;ted with the grand intermediate &s;tep in the affair of man's &s;alvation, the &s;ufferings and death of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to have &s;poken more ex|plicitly upon the matter, till this had been accompli&s;hed. But &s;till, &s;o much was
<PB N="19" REF="009088_0029_10311BEB94E1EAB0">
&s;aid in the promi&s;es of God to Adam and Abraham, and in the prophe&s;ies he in&s;pi|red his prophets to deliver, that it was known in general, that &s;ome great de&s;ign of mercy, by &s;ome extraordinary per&s;on that &s;hould be born of a woman, and pro|ceed from Abraham, was in pro&s;ecution; tho' they could not particularly &s;ay, what this mercy was, or how it would be ac|compli&s;hed thro' this "&s;eed of the wo|man," and "of Abraham." The clear and full knowledge of the&s;e things was re&s;erved to after-times, and has according|ly been revealed in the&s;e "la&s;t days." And to us, who are able to view the &s;cheme of God, as it has been explained by the birth, life, death, re&s;urrection and exaltation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and the &s;ettle|ment of the go&s;pel-kingdom in the world, with its means, motives, and advantages, in order to effect men's &s;alvation, it very evidently appears to be one uniform con|&s;i&s;tent de&s;ign, begun in the days of Adam, and carried on thro' the times of Abraham, Mo&s;es, and the prophets, till the coming of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; who, in con&s;equence of his humiliation to death, went up to heaven, and &s;ets there at the right hand of God, cloathed with all power, that he might fini&s;h this plan, and finally bring it into
<PB N="20" REF="009088_0030_10311BED1B490410">
effect. And it is, with me, one of the &s;tronge&s;t evidences of the truth of the go&s;pel, and the revelation contained in it, that the promi&s;e to Abraham, as well as that to Adam, and the other &s;imilar pro|mi&s;es and predictions, are &s;o expre&s;&s;ed as that the &s;cheme of &s;alvation by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as unfolded in the new-te&s;tament writings, is very obviou&s;ly, however &s;ummarily, pointed out in them; in&s;o|much that a &s;ober enquirer can &s;carce fail of being &s;atisfied, that one and the &s;ame plan has been in pro&s;ecution from the beginning; which plan, however dark to former ages, as to it's particulars, is now, in the times of the go&s;pel, made &s;ufficiently manife&s;t to all men.</P>
<P>IT is likewi&s;e natural to expect, from what has been &s;aid, that great multitudes will be ble&s;&s;ed in Je&s;us Chri&s;t. For the ble&s;&s;ing thro' him is promi&s;ed to "all na|tions and families of the earth." And can it be &s;uppo&s;ed, when the promi&s;e is thus gloriou&s;ly exten&s;ive, as to its object, that a few only will be ble&s;&s;ed in con&s;e|quence of it?</P>
<P>WHETHER we under&s;tand by this ble&s;&s;ing, go&s;pel means and advantages,

<P>THE go&s;pel has already been preached to, and the kingdom of the Son of God in fact &s;ettled among, a great many na|tions of the earth: in&s;omuch that if we reckon the individuals that now con&s;titute the&s;e collective bodies of men, and have been their con&s;tituent parts thro' the &s;e|veral &s;ucce&s;&s;ive ages, &s;ince Chri&s;t was made known to them, they will be va&s;tly numerous: And the account will &s;till in|crea&s;e, and ri&s;e almo&s;t beyond imagina|tion, if we carry our thoughts to tho&s;e numberle&s;s individuals who may yet be brought into exi&s;tence, and form the&s;e communities in all future ages.</P>

of the &s;alvation by Je&s;us Chri&s;t.&mdash;This &s;al|vation is the &s;ubject-matter of my text, the ble&s;&s;ing it promi&s;es; and it is ju&s;tly applicable to the&s;e tribes of men. As they are comprehended in the "all nati|ons" who &s;hall be "ble&s;&s;ed in the &s;eed of Abraham," they con&s;titute a part of the OBJECT of this divine engagement, and as truely &s;o as any other communities of the human race. And, it may be, they were particularly ranked, in the coun&s;els of God, among the nations that &s;hould eventually be ble&s;&s;ed thro' the &s;eed here promi&s;ed; though it was not till after-ages that they were bro't into actual exi&s;tence. We have &s;uch an ob&s;ervable pa&s;&s;age as that in the book of P&s;alms, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm LXXIV.20.</NOTE> "Have re&s;pect unto the covenant; for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty." The words may be looked upon as a prophetic prayer, looking forward to the times of Chri&s;t, when the covenant-promi&s;e to Abraham &s;hould be fulfilled: And the argument enforcing the prayer is, that there were places in "the earth covered with dark|ne&s;s," who&s;e inhabitants were, in a &s;ingu|lar &s;en&s;e, "barbarous and cruel." Per|haps, no places in the earth were ever more dark, and at the &s;ame time more

given to cruelty, than the&s;e American regions, as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the ab-originals. The Spirit who &s;pake thro' David might have in view the nations in the&s;e parts of the earth, and, upon the fore&s;ight of their deplorably &s;ad condition, pray God to "re&s;pect the covenant," his covenant with Abraham, which promi&s;ed a ble&s;&s;ing to the&s;e, among the other nations; a ble&s;&s;ing that would "turn them from darkne&s;s to light," and of &s;avage and cru|el, make them the peaceable, kind and tender-hearted di&s;ciples of the meek and compa&s;&s;ionate Je&s;us.

The co&s;t of bringing them would be very con&s;iderable; and they mu&s;t be permitted every now-and-then to make a vi&s;it to their parents and friends, which would be a great additional charge. They mu&s;t al&s;o be boarded and clothed, which would run the expence very high. Whereas, if they were taught where they now live, they might be maintained by their parents; and the only charge worth mention|ing would be that of &s;upporting &s;chool-ma&s;ters. More, it may be, would be required for the &s;upport of in&s;truc|tors among the Indians, than among our&s;elves; but this greater charge would be &s;mall in compari&s;on with me charge the other way. And the children might, in their own towns, as conveniently come to &s;chool, as if they were among us; for the Indian wigwams are every where nearer to one another, than the Engli&s;h hou&s;es in any of our villages. One &s;chool in a town would therefore very well an&s;wer all the ends we have in view, as none of the towns are &s;o large, but the chil|dren in all of them might ea&s;ily meet together every day for in&s;truction.

<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">We have not encouraged the &s;ending the&s;e boys; and, as we imagine, for very good rea&s;ons.

Indians, though fitted, in a good mea&s;ure, for the&s;e em|ployments, will not have that honor in their own coun|try, and among their own people, which is highly ex|pedient in order to their being u&s;eful; nor can they with de&s;irable confidence be relied on.

<P>THE &s;ervice you are going upon is dif|ficult.

But you have no rea&s;on to be di&s;couraged. The cau&s;e you are engaged in is nobly great and good. It is the cau&s;e of God; it is the cau&s;e of Chri&s;t; it is the cau&s;e, the promoting of which lies in "&s;hewing men the way of &s;alvation," through the atoning blood of the once crucified, but now exalted and glorified Je&s;us. The de&s;ign of your mi&s;&s;ion nearly re&s;embles that of the apo&s;tles of our Lord. You are "&s;et," as they were, "a light to the "Gentiles, that thou &s;houlde&s;t be for &s;alvation to the ends of the earth;" you are to go, as they did, to nations who&s;e "minds the god of this world hath blind|ed, that the light of the glorious go&s;pel of

And you may hum|bly hope, Chri&s;t will be with you, as he was with them, by the &s;pecial influences of his Spirit, to comfort your heart, to invigorate your faith, to animate your zeal, to &s;trengthen your re&s;olution, and, in a word, to enable you to &s;urmount all the difficulties that may attend the execu|tion of the tru&s;t to be committed to you.</P>
<P>LET your dependance be on Chri&s;t.&mdash; Seek to him, in the ways of his appoint|ment, for tho&s;e mea&s;ures of knowledge, prudence, fortitude, and all that grace and &s;trength, the &s;ervice you are called to may make nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>AND you &s;hould be encouraged to tru&s;t in him both for help and &s;ucce&s;s, when you remember and con&s;ider, that the <HI>tribes of men</HI> you are going to, make a part of "the nations," concerning whom the divine promi&s;e is, that they "&s;hall be ble&s;&s;ed in the &s;eed of Abraham," our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. And as the chief de|&s;ign of your mi&s;&s;ion is, that "this ble&s;&s;ing" may be extended to the&s;e people, in ac|compli&s;hment of the promi&s;e of God, will he be wanting in any thing proper, on his part, in order to your being &s;ucceeded

Had we, in times pa&s;t, been at the ex|pence that was nece&s;&s;ary in order to their in&s;truction in the things of God and Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in&s;tead of "&s;nares and traps to us, &s;courges in our &s;ides and thorns in our eyes," they might have been our fa&s;t friends, and maintained a corre&s;pondence with us to our advantage as well as their own. The French nation have taught us this to our &s;orrow as well as co&s;t.&mdash; They have all along made it a point to &s;upport mi&s;&s;ionaries among the Indians, wherever they could; and to this chiefly it is owing, that they have had &s;uch pow|er over them. By the pains they have
<PB N="46" REF="009088_0056_10311C2FA8AB3588">
taken to convert them, not to the faith of Chri&s;t, but to the religion of Rome, they have been able to u&s;e them as in|&s;truments in bringing into effect their mi&s;|chievous de&s;igns again&s;t us; and by them they have committed tho&s;e barbarities we &s;hould never have felt, could they not have excu&s;ed them&s;elves by transferring the &s;hame of them to the&s;e &s;avages in al|liance with them. And as there are nu|merous tribes of them untainted as yet with Romi&s;h &s;uper&s;tition, would it not be wi&s;e policy to u&s;e all proper endeavours to bring them to the faith, not "of a lie," but "of the truth as it is in Je&s;us?" Would not this, in the end, be the lea&s;t expen&s;ive method to make and keep them our good friends and peaceable neighbours?</P>
<P>BUT there are much higher motives to excite in us a zeal to promote the intere&s;t of Chri&s;t among the Indian tribes, and much nobler principles to act from in the charitable expre&s;&s;ions of it. &mdash; We &s;hould be con&s;trained from gratitude to God; that God, who, by crowning the Briti&s;h arms, in the&s;e American lands, with &s;uc|ce&s;s beyond even our bigge&s;t expectations, has opened a wide door for &s;ending the go&s;pel to the Gentiles inhabiting here. And in what more proper way can we

manife&s;t the &s;en&s;e we have of our obliga|tions to the &s;upreme Ruler, than by taking occa&s;ion from the &s;ignal victories he has given us to contribute to the enlargement of the kingdom of his &s;on Je&s;us Chri&s;t? If our MOTHER-COUNTY, and HE THAT SWAYS THE SCEPTRE THERE, &s;hould, by pious donations, encourage &s;uch mea&s;ures as are wi&s;ely concerted to &s;pread the religion of Je&s;us in the&s;e di&s;tant and dark corners of the world, would it be an un&s;uitable acknowledgment to "the King of Kings" for the great things he has done for them, as well as us? May we not rather &s;ay, thus "to do good and communicate" would be "an odour of a &s;weet &s;mell, a &s;acrifice acceptable, well-plea&s;ing to God"?&mdash;Love to Chri&s;t &s;hould likewi&s;e open our hearts and hands upon this occa&s;ion. 'Tis in his cau&s;e, and to promote the honor of his name, that we are urged to bountifulne&s;s: And how powerfully is this motive adapted to work upon us? Shall we pretend an affection to the Saviour of men, and not exert our|&s;elves, as we are able, and have oppor|tunity, to &s;pread the knowledge of his religion, and extend the borders of his kingdom? If we hang back, or di&s;cover a niggardly di&s;po&s;ition, "how dwelleth the love of Chri&s;t in us"? It may be

Who among the &s;ons of Adam are more proper objects of our chri&s;tian compa&s;&s;ion? And how &s;hould it operate, if not in charitable endeavours, that they may be "tran&s;la|ted into the light of the glorious go&s;pel"? With what face of truth can we profe&s;s religious kindne&s;s towards them, if we cannot find without our&s;elves a di&s;po&s;ition to be at &s;ome &s;mall expence to encourage the u&s;e of means to prevent their being "hurt of the &s;econd death"?</P>
<P>THERE are, I tru&s;t, a good number here pre&s;ent, who "love Chri&s;t that fir&s;t loved them," and tho&s;e al&s;o who are "ungodly and without &s;trength," as they were them&s;elves when Chri&s;t died "for them." And will &s;uch be &s;traitned in their own bowels, when they have a fair opportunity to a&s;&s;i&s;t in enlarging the in|tere&s;t of Chri&s;t, and &s;aving the &s;ouls of tho&s;e who are in a lo&s;t condition? They will rather exert them&s;elves with all chear|fulne&s;s and liberality in carrying &s;o noble a de&s;ign into execution.</P>

They would not then &s;pend their money in that furniture for their hou&s;es, or attendance on their per&s;ons, or ornament to their bodies, which the di&s;tinction God has made between them and others does not call for, but is the fruit of pride and vain-glory: they would not &s;pend it in &s;upporting criminal amu&s;e|ments and inglorious pa&s;times, which di&s;|&s;ipate the mind, and indi&s;po&s;e it to the ex|erci&s;es of piety and devotion; and are be|&s;ides greatly hurtful to &s;ociety: much le&s;s would they &s;pend it in that luxurious in|temperate way of living, which tends to pamper lu&s;t, and render it head&s;trong and impetuous.
