<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>_AFter the late In&s;urrection was quelled, it was hoped that unanimity and concord would again have taken place among the good People of this Province: And as the lenity of the Go|vernment was &s;o great as to pardon the Offenders, it was expected that not even their abettors would again attempt to rekindle the coals of &s;trife and jealou&s;y in the brea&s;ts of the ra&s;h and incon&s;iderate.</P>
<P>But unhappily for Penn&s;ylvania, there &s;eems to be &s;ome of its Inhabitants that are re&s;olved to leave no &s;tone un|turned till they can hit upon the means that will force a la&s;ting breach among their Fellow-Countrymen. In this Cla&s;s of Men appears the Author of the Piece under pre|&s;ent con&s;ideration; called <HI>The Quaker Unma&s;k'd; or, Plain Truth.</HI> Which, as he a&s;&s;erts to be matter of fact, it may be expedient to canva&s;s its pages, and &s;ee if it be the &s;pirit of Truth that breathes through it, or a wilful Mi&s;repre|&s;entation: In the di&s;qui&s;ition of which, we &s;hall endeavour, as much as po&s;&s;ible, to avoid railing, and only &s;tick to the argument.</P>
<P>The Unma&s;ker &s;ays, "He thinks it a Duty incum|bent on every good &s;ubject to make diligent &s;earch, in or|der to find out the aggre&s;&s;ors, and then to inform the Public how he has found matters".&mdash;Let us &s;ee how con|&s;i&s;tent he pro&s;ecutes this de&s;ign: Fir&s;t then, without give|ing the lea&s;t proof of it, he roundly a&s;&s;erts, that "The&s;e Incendiaries (the Quakers) have wrote and publi&s;hed &s;e|veral inflamatory Pamphlets with a de&s;ign to enrage the Populace". Surely, our Unma&s;ker never could have made "diligent Search", or he would not have begun with &s;o great a mi&s;take; the Quakers Addre&s;s to the Governor being the &s;ole Piece they have publi&s;hed, vindicating
<PB N="4" REF="009805_0003_0F7A55032B0E56C0">
them&s;elves from the invidious reflections of the <HI>Declara|tion</HI> and <HI>Remon&s;trance.</HI></P>
<P>How unfair does this Unma&s;ker proceed in the next paragraph, "The Savage Indian Butchers&mdash;who&s;e cau&s;e and intere&s;t Quakers &s;o warmly e&s;pou&s;e". Do the Qua|kers, or any one el&s;e, e&s;pou&s;e the cau&s;e of &s;uch? Did not &s;everal of the Rioters examine all the Indians at the Bar|racks that the City has protected? and didn't they ac|knowledge that they knew not one of them? then how groundle&s;s is this A&s;&s;ertion!&mdash;</P>
<P>Again, "Terrible! indeed beyond De&s;cription, are the Cruelties daily practi&s;ed by tho&s;e Savages on our Fellow-Subjects, while Pri&s;oners among&s;t them! But where are the Quakers who have taken up arms to defend them"? Defend who? &mdash; What, defend tho&s;e that are pri&s;oners? &mdash; Have not the Quakers bore their burden of taxes equal with others? and what other way has any in|terior part of the Province defended its Frontiers?</P>
<P>The Unma&s;ker now opens a paragraph as angry as it is gro&s;sly fallacious; "When the Indian incur&s;ions la&s;t &s;ummer laid wa&s;te a con&s;iderable part of our Frontier, how did the&s;e meek Quakers behave on &s;o melancholy an occa&s;ion; to their immortal Infamy be it known that they would not grant a &s;ingle farthing (as a Society) for the relief of their poor Fellow-Subjects". A great defi|ciency appears here in his "diligent Search": The Qua|kers (or Incendiaries, as he hand&s;omely calls them) did make a Collection as a Society, but withheld it for a while, as there were generous Contributions &s;ent to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Frontier-Inhabitants, by &s;everal other Societies in Town; thinking, that, when tho&s;e Monies had been nigh exhau&s;ted, their Sub&s;criptions might be of greater u&s;e. Accordingly &s;ome Gentlemen of their Society (with whom the Money was depo&s;ited) wrote &s;everal times to a Clergyman in one of the Frontier-Town&s;hips, de&s;iring him to take upon him the di&s;tribution of their Money, as he was be&s;t acquainted with the circum&s;tances of tho&s;e
<PB N="5" REF="009805_0004_0F7A5503EBF6F588">
about him;&mdash;and he as often refu&s;ed: alledging that their a&s;&s;i&s;tance was not wanted.&mdash;This they did as a Society.&mdash; And at the &s;ame time many Individuals mo&s;t freely opened their pur&s;es, and joined in private Collections.&mdash;So that we &s;ee, this vehement outcry "of immortal Infamy" means nothing.&mdash;</P>
<P>But, &s;ays the Unma&s;ker, "When their good Brethren the Indians (<HI>&s;ome</HI> of <HI>whom</HI> were <HI>well known</HI> by Officers now in this City, to have been in the battle again&s;t Colo|nel Bouquet, and others at the &s;iege of Fort Pitt, during the &s;ummer) &s;eemed in danger of receiving their <HI>Ju&s;t</HI> de|&s;erts, &amp;c. no toils are thought too great&mdash;to protect the&s;e <HI>Bo&s;om-friends".</HI> The Officer who was charged with &s;ay|ing he knew them, declared in divers public Companies that it was an ab&s;olute fal&s;ehood, and that he had never uttered &s;uch a thing. Is it likely that in the hurry and confu&s;ion of a battle, or at the irregular &s;iege of Fort Pitt, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See 12th Page of <HI>Q&mdash;r U&mdash;'d.</HI></NOTE> "the red, blue, or any other colour painted" Indians &s;een there, &s;hould be <HI>well known,</HI> when &s;een again in Philadelphia in their natural colour?&mdash;Or were it po&s;|&s;ible that that &s;hould be the ca&s;e, is it to be thought that tho&s;e Gentlemen Officers would not have informed the Ci|vil Magi&s;trates of &s;o e&s;&s;ential a truth? On the contrary did they not all (the Officer in particular who was charged with &s;aying be knew them) expre&s;s the greate&s;t abhor|rence of the intended Ma&s;&s;acre, and willingne&s;s (as well as the Citizens) to protect the Indians? But the Un|ma&s;ker, we &s;ee, unma&s;ks him&s;elf with all his circum&s;pec|tion: In the fir&s;t page he &s;ays, "&s;hall we attempt to vin|dicate their killing Indians under the protection of the Government? By no means". But here we &s;ee he thinks it would have been <HI>"Ju&s;t".</HI> And in the next paragraph he acknowledges "the Paxton People's coming down in a <HI>&s;eemingly</HI> ho&s;tile manner, is <HI>ju&s;tly</HI> to be condemned". What a &s;trange contradiction is here! But this will be
<PB N="6" REF="009805_0005_0F7A5504D2186E58">
always the ca&s;e, when men under the Veil of Truth, endeavour to hide <HI>the bittere&s;t Rancour and Ill-will.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>But let us further li&s;ten to what is &s;aid in behalf of the Rioters:&mdash;"They had long before," &s;ays their Cham|pion, "&s;ent &s;everal Petitions to the Governor and A&s;&s;em|bly, which, it's <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed,</HI> have been concealed by &s;ome ill-de&s;igning per&s;ons; his Honour never having received the&s;e Remon&s;trances, &mdash; and they looked upon them&s;elves as neglected by the Government". Is it not &s;urprizing that if the&s;e People had done &s;o, they &s;hould not have availed them&s;elves of &s;o &s;trong a Plea in their Declara|tion and Remon&s;trance? where not a word like it is men|tioned. And are tho&s;e that they &s;ent &s;uch <HI>Petitions</HI> to (whom we may &s;uppo&s;e their unque&s;tionable Friends) &s;o neglectful of their cau&s;e and intere&s;t, as to conceal &s;uch important Papers? But this Writer has made &s;o bold with Truth in &s;everal other places, that he has given us rea&s;on to doubt the verity of this a&s;&s;ertion. But admitting that to be the ca&s;e, why are the poor Quakers to be &s;o egre|giously reviled? Is it to be thought that <HI>they</HI> either con|cealed the Petitions, or bribed others to do it?</P>
<P>In the next paragraph he owns, the Paxton People are "mad", but &s;ays it is owing to their "Oppre&s;&s;ion". For, &s;ays he, "have not all Nations and Generations found it &s;o? Nay, is not the happy and glorious <HI>Revolution,</HI> by which our Civil and Religious Rights, as <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> and <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> were &s;ecured on their pre&s;ent footing, a <HI>&s;triking In&s;tance</HI> of this Truth"? that is, were not the renowned <HI>Na&s;&s;au,</HI> and all tho&s;e <HI>Worthies,</HI> that a&s;&s;i&s;ted in e&s;tabli&s;hing the ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Revolution,</HI> "mad", like the Pr&mdash;&s;t. enflamed Rioters of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania?</HI> Noble compari&s;on! thrice pui&s;&s;ant Advocate! &mdash; And how can the Quakers help their "madne&s;s" and "de&s;peration"? But here we have a Clue to the whole Scheme of Philopatrius, which accounts for the great zeal and warmth he has &s;hewn on this occa&s;ion; it is a <HI>Revolution</HI> then that he is hankering after, and prompts him, thus, by way of &s;imile,
<PB N="7" REF="009805_0006_0F7A550566CA2D00">
openly to pro&s;titute one of the mo&s;t au&s;picious Events in the Briti&s;h Annals to his low and illiberal purpo&s;es. But let the Caballers have a care that they dont fare like the Dog in the Fable, and loo&s;e the Sub&s;tance by gra&s;ping at the Shadow.</P>
<P>"What the&s;e People intended by their coming down <HI>armed",</HI> &s;ays he, "let them&s;elves declare". This is no bad in&s;tance of Philopatrius's mode&s;ty, as we &s;ee he is a&s;hamed to mention their intention, for it would be too ridiculous to &s;uppo&s;e he could feign ignorance of it &s;o late in the day; more e&s;pecially as, he &s;ays, they &s;ent
"&s;e|veral Petitions",
which not being mention'd in the Declaration, &amp;c. mu&s;t be a piece of private intelligence which he was let into. But the &s;tyle of both the&s;e Pieces is &s;o wonderfully &s;imilar, that it is more than po&s;&s;ible the &s;ame Lucina u&s;hered them into the world.</P>
<P>To elucidate this matter, let us &s;ee what rea&s;on the Citizens of Philadelphia (including the few armed Qua|kers) had to put them&s;elves in a defen&s;ive po&s;ture: &mdash; News was brought to them of a great Number of armed Men being on their way towards the City; their de&s;ign being, as they gave out, to kill all tho&s;e Indians (Friends of this Province) in the Barracks, Men, Women and Children, that were under the Protection of the Govern|ment, and to force their way through all oppo&s;ition, or die in the attempt; and likewi&s;e threatened what they would do to &s;everal of the Citizens. The Inhabitants therefore, (&s;hocked at &s;o inhuman and illegal a project) entered into an A&s;&s;ociation, at the reque&s;t of the Go|vernor, to &s;trengthen the hands of Magi&s;tracy, and op|po&s;e the extravagant de&s;igns of the Rioters, few of whom were Freeholders or Men of Property, the majority of them being people the Caballers had in pay. But the Ci|tizens of Philadelphia had no de&s;ign to offer them the lea&s;t injury, unle&s;s they &s;hould u&s;e violence; which evi|dently appears from the mea&s;ures they entered into with them.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="009805_0007_0F7A550627BB66E8">However, Philopatrius "<HI>only</HI> ob&s;erves that their be|haviour did them <HI>honour,</HI> as it &s;hewed them to be <HI>brave, loyal,</HI> and <HI>di&s;creet".</HI> I would a&s;k this Gentleman, in what Nation was it ever counted <HI>"brave",</HI> to de&s;ire to attack a defencele&s;s confin'd body of people, with a re&s;olution, in cool blood, to kill them all, Men, Women and Chil|dren? In what State or Government was it ever thought <HI>"loyal",</HI> to fly in the face of Authority, and trample down the Laws of their Country? In what Realm or Re|gion was it ever deemed <HI>"di&s;creet",</HI> for a Man to come with a Petition in one hand, and a loaded Mu&s;ket in the other. The Unma&s;ker may think as he plea&s;es, but I am &s;ure this is not PLAIN TRUTH.</P>
<P>"They &s;ent in a Memorial", &s;ays this Writer, "to the Governor; letting his Honour know that by &s;uch a time they would be at Germantown, and there halt till he was plea&s;ed to give them an an&s;wer". If they did &s;end in their Petition before they came to Germantown, it was &s;o far commendable, and &s;poke more in their favour than their preceding conduct. But it has been ob&s;erved that it was by no means dictated in the petitory manner; a &s;mall quotation will evince the truth of this remark, where, &s;peaking of killing the Indians in the Barracks, they &s;ay, "It is this we DESIGN, it is this we are RESOLVED to PROSECUTE".</P>
<P>"Some of the People called Quakers", &s;ays the Un|ma&s;ker, "&s;aid that they had force &s;ufficient to kill the whole", and "it was better &s;o, than conde&s;cend to treat with &s;uch a Banditti". It is impo&s;&s;ible in an an&s;wer of this kind to decide what "&s;ome of the People" might &s;ay. However, had any Quakers of note made &s;uch a propo|&s;ition, why did he not mention their names? Certainly, he does not want good-will enough to expo&s;e them. But as he only a&s;&s;erts it without proof, I mu&s;t u&s;e the freedom of &s;u&s;pending my a&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P>"Neverthele&s;s", &s;ays he, "tho&s;e Gentlemen, who were more aver&s;e to the &s;hedding of the blood of their Fellow-Subjects,
<PB N="9" REF="009805_0008_0F7A5507BA507F50">
than the meek, peaceful, in&s;pired Quakers, did prevail". Here we have another in&s;tance of our Au|thor's fair and ingenuous way of arguing. Even admit|ting (tho' with little rea&s;on) that &s;ome called Quakers might have been of that opinion, does it infer that the Quakers (i. e. the Society) approved of &s;uch &s;entiments. Let us reduce the &s;en&s;e of this to the &s;chola&s;tick way of rea&s;oning, and &s;ee what a pretty &s;yllogi&s;m it will make.</P>
<P>If <HI>&s;ome</HI> called Quakers would have fought the Paxton People, had they come to Philadelphia, it means the <HI>meek, peaceful, in&s;pired</HI> Quakers would.</P>
<P>But &s;ome <HI>called</HI> Quakers would have fought, had they come to Philadelphia;</P>
<P>Erg&ograve;, the "<HI>meek, peaceful, in&s;pired</HI> Quakers wanted to &s;hed the blood of their Fellow-Subjects."</P>
<P>What a curious Logic is here! And yet this would be the Unma&s;ker's inference.</P>
<P>"They were willing," &s;ays he, "to di&s;per&s;e and re|turn to their re&s;pective homes, which was accordingly agreed to". (Tho' by the by, it is conceived from an other rea&s;on than that alledged; to wit) "on provi&s;o they might have a fair hearing", "and they di&s;per&s;ed without doing any <HI>Mi&s;chief".</HI> Then their de&s;ign was mi&s;chievous? "They (the Paxton People) have charged the Quakers with gro&s;s partiality to Indians, and their being unfit for Government, nay, a&s;cribe the <HI>greate&s;t</HI> part of their &s;ufferings to them ALONE". This is not &s;o "glaring a Fact" neither, as the Unma&s;ker would make it out. That the Quakers have had more trouble, and been at more expence than any other Society in the Province, in endeavouring to bring the Indians over to the Engli&s;h Intere&s;t, ever &s;ince the commencement of la&s;t War, is a truth that all the impartial will acknow|ledge. If they have not been &s;o fortunate as to accom|pli&s;h their de&s;ign, and have &s;hewn too much lenity to|wards them, would it not be more becoming an unpre|judiced, candid per&s;on, to attribute &s;uch errors to a fai|lure <PB N="10" REF="009805_0009_0F7A5508B07AA500">
in judgment, rather than a de&s;ign in the Quakers to have our bleeding Borders infe&s;ted with the cruel Bar|barians of the Wilderne&s;s? Indeed our Frontier-Inhabitants have been &s;trangely deluded and abu&s;ed concerning the character, that has been handed to them, of this People. "They do &s;ympathize" (mo&s;t &s;incerely) "with them", and unfeignedly "pity their di&s;tre&s;&s;es". But they have Enemies in Philadelphia, that are determined, if it lays in their power, to make the Frontier-Inhabitants ever|la&s;tingly hate them. &mdash;The re&s;t of this paragraph contains &s;ome <HI>low</HI> invectives, quite foreign to PLAIN TRUTH, and are too <HI>mean</HI> to de&s;erve any further notice.</P>
<P>"Let us next con&s;ider Quakers with re&s;pect to Go|vernment"; &s;ays the Unma&s;ker, "Can it be con&s;i&s;tent that a Per&s;on who declares that his con&s;cience forbids him to take up Arms, &s;hould be a Repre&s;entative for a warlike People? By no means: Neither is it an "<HI>inex|pre&s;&s;ible ab&s;urdity"</HI> that a man who communes with the Quakers may not make a good Repre&s;entative even "in time of war". You &s;tare at this, Sir, as militating again&s;t it&s;elf; but let us examine, look into any Set of Chri&s;tians, and you may find &s;ome of its Members that don't agree in every Article of its Believe, and yet com|mune with that Society which they have been educated among. Nor is this, I conceive, at all prepo&s;terous or hypocritical. The Father in&s;tructs his Son in what he thinks is truth, and during the &s;on's minority the father endeavours to implant his own opinions into the bo&s;om of his child, but when the &s;on arrives to years of under|&s;tanding, it is his peculiar privilege to judge for him&s;elf; (and he is accountable to GOD only, the Author of his being, for his thoughts) and then, as men vary &s;o much in their &s;entiments, how common is it for people to re|cede from their primary in&s;tructions in &s;ome particulars, and yet hold in the main with the Chri&s;tian Sy&s;tem in which they have been educated? nor was this ever thought duplicity, or counted a di&s;&s;embling part, by &s;en&s;ible
<PB N="11" REF="009805_0010_0F7A5509438EB888">
and thinking men. Thus, we have had &s;everal in&s;tances, at divers times, of men who have been educated Qua|kers, (unexceptionable, moral men) who have thought it no Crime to defend their King and Country, their Laws and Immunities again&s;t the violence of a foreign, or dome&s;tic enemy. Non-re&s;i&s;tance, therefore, is not "a <HI>fundamental Principle"</HI> univer&s;al among Quakers. But if it is &s;o "inexpre&s;&s;ibly ab&s;urd" for a Quaker to be an A&s;&s;emblyman, why in the name of &s;en&s;e are they not left out at the annual <HI>Elections?</HI> How few Quakers to Members of other Societies is there, in the Counties of Lanca&s;ter and York! and yet we find Quaker A&s;|&s;emblymen even in tho&s;e places: What can be the rea|&s;on of this? Is it that the people really think them the &s;uitable&s;t men, or are their Con&s;tituents under an "in|fatuation"? as the Declaration civily expre&s;&s;es it.</P>
<P>"Here", the Unma&s;ker "ob&s;erves, that the peo|ple whom the Quakers took up arms to <HI>de&s;troy"</HI> (might not the Quakers, with equal ju&s;tice, rejoin, the people that &s;aid they'd &s;calp them) "were tho&s;e who pre&s;erved them from feeling the <HI>Severities</HI> and <HI>Contrivances</HI> of <HI>In|dian Cruelty?</HI> "'Tis owing", &s;ays he, "to the brave &s;tand which the&s;e unrequited Voluntiers have made again&s;t the inroads of Savages, that the Quakers are now able to treat their Protectors with &s;uch ingratitude." (Is that really the ca&s;e then? God ble&s;s them for it! and may their King and Country amply reward them!)&mdash;Can the Unma&s;ker &s;eriou&s;ly think that the Paxton Volun|tiers expedition to the Great I&s;land was the means of Phi|ladelphia's not being laid wa&s;te by Savages, and its Inha|bitants butchered? If this is not his meaning "feeling the <HI>Severities</HI> and <HI>Contrivances</HI> of <HI>Indian Cruelty,"</HI> mu&s;t be idle words. (That Expedition was unque&s;tionably prai&s;e-worthy) but &s;urely the Unma&s;ker mu&s;t be dreaming, or only means this for a flouri&s;h. Were the Quakers the only people that armed on the late occa&s;ion? Were there not Churchmen, <HI>Pre&s;byterians,</HI> Roman Catholicks, &amp;c
<PB N="12" REF="009805_0011_0F7A5509F24F68E8">
in &s;hort did not all good and hone&s;t men approve of the oppo&s;ition? But the Quakers mu&s;t be made odious at any rate.</P>
<P>"Behold the Meeting-Hou&s;e", &s;ays he, "converted into a place of Arms". One of the days that the City was under arms happened to be Meeting-Day, and the Meeting-Hou&s;e was opened at the u&s;ual hour for the re|ception of its Members, but before they came, a Com|pany of the A&s;&s;ociation had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it to &s;hel|ter them&s;elves from the inclemency of the weather, it being a rainy day, and there remained till evening; from thence, he &s;ays, the Quakers have converted it into "a place of Arms".</P>
<P>"Whil&s;t &s;ome of their <HI>Preachers</HI> are bu&s;ied in procure|ing Powder and Shot, others are employed in refre&s;hing the &s;pirit or their brave Soldiers with Wine and other Liquors." Amazing Fal&s;ehood! and is this his Addre&s;s to the Public of <HI>Plain Truth?</HI>&mdash;De&s;picable Scribbler! thus to violate the &s;acred name of <HI>Truth</HI> with &s;uch bare|faced Fictions.</P>
<P>The Unma&s;ker here gives way to his depraved fancy once more, and, to make u&s;e of a peculiar expre&s;&s;ion of his, "&s;addles" the Quakers with a malicious invention of his own, in&s;tead of proving matters of fact; &mdash; wretched &s;uccedaneum!&mdash; in which among other things, equally kind, he puts this into the mouth of a Quaker, "nay <HI>we &s;ecretly rejoice</HI> when we hear of <HI>whole Settle|ments</HI> MURDERED and DESTROYED". Sure this un|happy man's &s;en&s;es mu&s;t be &s;teep'd in gall, and his heart da&s;h'd with wormwood, to utter &s;uch dete&s;table calumny.</P>
<P>"But it may be asked", &s;ays the Unma&s;ker, "why all this <HI>Clamour</HI> again&s;t Quakers? ay! and with the greate&s;t rea&s;on! but Philopatrius &s;eems to be &s;en&s;ible at la&s;t, that he is gro&s;sly abu&s;ing a Society of People, on little or no grounds. This Writer &s;ays, "to talk again&s;t Pre&s;byterians as &s;uch, is the effect either of party-&s;pirit, malice or non&s;en&s;e." I agree with him with
<PB N="13" REF="009805_0012_0F7A550AAA822FD8">
all my heart; and think likewi&s;e that to talk again&s;t Quakers as &s;uch, is equally the effect either of malice and party-&s;pirit or non&s;en&s;e. To confine virtue or vice to any particular &s;ect or &s;et of men, &s;hews little know|ledge in human nature and a mo&s;t uncharitable narrow|ne&s;s of &s;pirit; human nature being all formed out of the &s;ame e&s;&s;ence, and only di&s;per&s;ed in different degrees to different men; every Society, therefore, has its knaves and hone&s;t men; and that the Quakers have their <HI>Modi|cum</HI> of the later, with other Communities, I mu&s;t in charity believe.</P>
<P>In the next paragraph we have an ob&s;ervation of the father of Con&s;tantine the Great, that, "they who were fal&s;e to their God, would never be true to their Prince." Which he &s;eems to in&s;inuate is applicable to the Qua|kers; and that they are like "the Pagans, ready to embrace any religion indifferently", and of cour&s;e &s;hould be "di&s;carded," and, "the Chri&s;tians", that is, Paxton people, "be employed, who firmly adhere to their pro|fe&s;&s;ion." I would not invidiou&s;ly pervert any man's meaning, but I can put no other &s;en&s;e on this paragraph.</P>
<P>"Let us look round", &s;ays the Unmasker, "and &s;ee who are tho&s;e who enjoy the Places of Profit and Tru&s;t in this Province; (<HI>a very few</HI> excepted) are they not Qua|kers or Quakers <HI>Creatures?"</HI> are all tho&s;e Gentlemen then, of other Societies in the Province, (<HI>a very few</HI> ex|cepted,) that bear public Offices, Quakers <HI>Creatures?</HI>&mdash; abu&s;ive man!&mdash;to let his factious zeal carry him to &s;uch lengths of vile defamation.</P>
<P>"It has been argued", &s;ays he, "if the Indians are guilty let their accu&s;ers appear, and not put them to death without a fair trial"? and doubtle&s;s a very up|right and Chri&s;tian argument it is: but becau&s;e "it is a hard matter to prove Indians guilty,&mdash;that are not guilty&mdash;"put them to death without a fair trial."</P>
<P>Again, "But it <HI>has been proved</HI> by <HI>a very circum&s;tan|tial Oath</HI> of a young man (who has &s;ince very unac|countably
<PB N="14" REF="009805_0013_0F7A550B8F362A40">
di&s;appeared) that the Quakers, or Per&s;ons who appeared to be &s;uch, have convey'd off and con|cealed the&s;e (Indians) that were mo&s;t &s;u&s;pected". It is &s;aid in the Scriptures, that there be &s;ome men who will deba&s;e them&s;elves even to Hell: what a marvellous de|gree of turpitude does this Writer here di&s;cover! and what a malignant heart mu&s;t &s;uch a man have! to men|tion a mo&s;t infamous Forgery, as&mdash;<HI>"a very circum&s;tan|tial Oath"?</HI> and to &s;ay the a&s;&s;ertion <HI>"has been proved":</HI> a perjury that had been plotted with a de&s;ign to &s;canda|lize and vilify the King's Officers, (that had orders from the General to guard the Indians) and the Society of Quakers; the Per&s;on who took the qualification, having ab&s;conded, and the Magi&s;trate, who gave the Oath, being afterwards of opinion that he was perjur'd.</P>
<P>I have now gone thro' the task I impo&s;ed on my&s;elf; to wit, a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of "THE QUAKER UNMASK'D", or PLAIN TRUTH": and from what the Unmasker has &s;aid, "I hope my Countrymen will coolly con&s;ider", whether or no, in his "diligent Search after Aggre&s;&s;ors", he has hit upon "PLAIN TRUTH"? and whether it is ap|parent that the Quakers have &s;hewn any favour to our <HI>Savage Enemies,</HI> or attempted to &s;creen one of them from Ju&s;tice? and whether &s;ome Members of that Communi|ty's joining their Fellow-Citizens to protect the <HI>Innocent</HI> from the bloody violence of a deluded people can be called &s;o? And la&s;tly, that this did not proceed from any prejudice to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Frontier-Inhabitants, or the want of generous &s;ympathizing hearts, but from a noble regard to ju&s;tice, and the pre&s;ervation of the Laws of their Country, is it not equally clear?</P>
<P>And now, my Countrymen, if this is the ca&s;e, and I believe all the impartial will acknowledge it is, what mu&s;t we think of a Writer who without any provocation could thus attempt to bla&s;t the reputation of &s;o large a Body of People, many of whom are valuable Members of Society? What mu&s;t we think of a man who could
<PB N="15" REF="009805_0014_0F7A550C42F49780">
treat his neighbour with &s;uch &s;currility&punc; who could pu|bli&s;h &s;uch ba&s;e fal&s;ehoods, under the mask of truth? It &s;urely could not ari&s;e from a zeal, as he pretended, "that Peace might again be re&s;tored among us?" No: Such a &s;uppo&s;ition would imply greater &s;tupidity than belongs to his character. Let me &s;peak with boldne&s;s what rea&s;on and truth con&s;pire to dictate. We mu&s;t than conclude that our <HI>Unma&s;ker</HI> had no other de&s;ign but to vindicate the conduct of <HI>Rioters,</HI> and be&s;patter as much as po&s;&s;ible the name of a <HI>Quaker,</HI> no matter with how little ju&s;tice or decency; to impo&s;e on the ignorant, in|flame the giddy, and to prolong the alienation (unhap|py circum&s;tance!) which has already taken place. Judge then, my Fellow-Countrymen, whether &s;uch a man's opinion &s;hould determine you in your choice of Repre&s;entatives?&mdash;</P>
<P>But I ha&s;ten to conclude, in the &s;entiment of a noble Lord, upon another occa&s;ion; Whatever factions may ari&s;e, and however loud the Drummers of faction may &s;ound their noi&s;y alarms; however they may attempt to drown the voice of rea&s;on and truth by their clamour; let the <HI>Friends of Penn&s;ylvania</HI> lay a&s;ide the animo&s;ities which have been rai&s;ed and maintained by the wicked and by the weak; let them hold fa&s;t their integrity, and &s;up|port with &s;pirit the Cau&s;e of their Country and its Laws, and they will confirm the good, reclaim the bad, van|qui&s;h the incorrigible, and Peace again &s;hall be re&s;tored among us.</P>

<P>I cannot withhold expre&s;&s;ing the plea&s;ure I have, in &s;eeing the happy fruits of having Indian Allies in the pro&s;ecution of an Indian War; and therefore &s;hall make no apology for annexing the following paragraph out of the Public Papers; which I humbly conceive is not foreign to the nature of this Pamphlet.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="article">
<HEAD>NEW-YORK, <HI>March</HI> 12.</HEAD>
<P>"Our advices from the Frontiers of this Province, received by way of Expre&s;s on Thur&s;day la&s;t, and by the Albany Po&s;t on Saturday, are of as indubitable authority and credit, as the Ex|tract we gave in our la&s;t relating to the march of 200 Indians &s;ent out by Sir <HI>William John&s;on,</HI> again&s;t the Indian village of Kane&s;tio.&mdash;" The&s;e advices are, that on the 2d in&s;tant, at night, Sir <HI>William</HI> received an Expre&s;s by an Indian and a white Man, from the above party, importing, "That on the even|ing of the 26th of February, they had reached the main branch of the river Su&s;quehanna, on their way we&s;tward, when they re|ceived private advices, that a large body of Delawares, our Enemies, were at a &s;mall di&s;tance, de&s;tined again&s;t &s;ome of our &s;ettlements; upon which intelligence our party immediately made all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch to &s;urprize them, which they happily effected, by &s;urrounding them in their encampment at the dawn of day on the 27th. Their approach was &s;o &s;udden, that our Enemies could make no defence, and were made pri&s;oners to the number of 41, with their Chief Capt. BULL (an Indian) &s;on of Teedyu&s;cung, a per&s;on who has been in Arms again&s;t the Eng|li&s;h, during all the late ho&s;tilities, having headed many parties, and di&s;covered great inveteracy again&s;t us. Our Indians imme|diately bound the pri&s;oners, and &s;ent them under a &s;trong e&s;cort to Sir <HI>William,</HI> where they were expected a day or two after the 3d in&s;tant." <HI>(We tru&s;t this good beginning will be followed by &s;ome other &s;ucce&s;&s;es, and &s;ufficiently prove the IMPORTANCE they are of in an Indian War, as well as the Judgment of the pre|&s;ent General, who has made u&s;e of their Services.)</HI> Penn&s;ylvania Gazette, Numb. 1838.</P>
