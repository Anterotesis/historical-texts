<HEAD>The Preface, To the candid and unprejudiced Reader.</HEAD>
<P>AS Mr. WHITEFIELD's gro&s;s Mi&s;repre&s;entations of the following Sermons have obliged me to publi&s;h them, I mu&s;t give &s;ome Account of his Con|duct whil&s;t: in this Place. I know let me be never &s;o careful to avoid per&s;onal Reflections, and to re|pre&s;ent his darling Doctrines and ra&s;h Cen&s;ures in the true&s;t Light and tendere&s;t Manner; yet &s;hall I hardly e&s;cape the Reproaches of &s;ome&mdash;. But the rude&s;t Clamours will give me no unea&s;ine&s;s; for my Con&s;cience bears me Witne&s;s, that I am doing my Duty; that my De&s;igns are fair and hone&s;t: I am not &s;o much Concerned for my own Vindication, as for the Credit of our <HI>holy and rea&s;onable Religion,</HI> and for the Reputation of our <HI>Mother Church</HI> under God, the Bulwark of the Reformation, and of her able&s;t Champions indu&s;triou&s;ly abu&s;ed and de&s;amed of late.</P>
<P>When Mr, WHITEFIELD arrived here la&s;t Year, I gave him at fir&s;t the u&s;e of our Church; and looked upon him at fir&s;t as a well-meaning tho' <HI>ra&s;h</HI> Young Man, who had imbibed &s;ome mi&s;taken Notions of
<PB N="iv" REF="004499_0003_100D5ADD777F6D90">
Religion; for which rea&s;on I advi&s;ed him, in the mo&s;t &s;erious and tender Manner I could, to examine the Principles he went upon with greater Delibera|tion; adding; that I was &s;orry he had lo&s;t the e&s;teem of the <HI>Clergy</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> whom even their Enemies allowed to be generally eminent for Learning and Lenity. However, could he happily get over his Prejudices, he might, through God's Ble&s;&s;ing, do much good in <HI>America,</HI> by means of his agreeable Voice and &s;erious Manner, &amp;c. I farther promi&s;ed, according to his Behaviour, to u&s;e my Intere&s;t with my Brethren on the Continent, to recommend him to the favour of the Clergy, upon his return to his Native Country.</P>
<P>But I &s;oon perceived him Proof again&s;t any &s;uch Advice; for &s;ome few Days after, both from our Pulpit and in his <HI>Street-Preaching</HI> he ra&s;hly accu&s;ed the Clergy in general of <Q><HI>Hypocri&s;y</HI> and <HI>fal&s;e Doctrine</HI>; of &s;ub&s;cribing without believirg their <HI>Articles,</HI> in order to get into Preferment; and that when once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of their Churches, they locked the Doors and put the Keys into their Pockets,</Q> &amp;c. When I expo&s;tulated the Matter with him, ju&s;tly ob&s;erving how unju&s;t, ra&s;h and uncharitable &s;uch a Charge was again&s;t a Body of Men, of whom perhaps he knew not one in a Thou&s;and; all the An&s;wer he made was, that he did not mean them all, only the Generality of them.</P>
<P>Soon after I &s;aw, with <HI>his Name</HI> to it, an abu&s;ive An&s;wer to the <HI>Bi&s;hop of London's</HI> late Pa&s;toral Letter,
<PB N="v" REF="004499_0004_100D5ADF47CD5C38">
wherein his <HI>Lord&s;hip</HI> &s;eriou&s;ly and &s;ea&s;onably cautions the People of his <HI>Dioce&s;s,</HI> again&s;t the two dangerous Extremes of <HI>Lukewarmne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m.</HI> The Letter is wrote with that &s;trength of Rea&s;on and good Sen&s;e, with that Per&s;picuity and Gravity, which &s;eems natural to our pious and prudent Dioce&s;an; with that Chri&s;tian Calmne&s;s and true Z a&s;, which di&s;covers his real Concern for &s;acred Truth, and his tender regard for the good of Souls, in danger of being deluded and mi&s;lead.</P>
<P>His three Letters in Oppo&s;ition to <HI>Infidelity</HI> were wrote, &s;ome Years agone, with the &s;ame Candid and Chri&s;tian Spirit; containing Arguments in a manner Demon&s;trative, and yet &s;o admirably fitted to all Capacities, that, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, they proved an excellent <HI>Antidote</HI> againg the <HI>Poi&s;on</HI> &s;o indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;pread at that Time. Had Mr.
WH&mdash;D &s;eriou&s;ly peru&s;ed them, e&s;pecially the 2d Letter; the &s;hort View there di&s;play'd of the Chri&s;tian In&s;titution, would have in&s;tructed him in the true &s;criptural Sen&s;e of our <HI>Articles,</HI> concerning Ju&s;tification through Chri&s;t Je&s;us. For tho' we are ju&s;tified freely through his <Q>Grace; yet the Go&s;pel Account is as full and expre&s;s, as Words can make it, on the one Hand, that Faith in Chri&s;t is the Foundation of a Chri&s;tians Title to Heaven; and on the other Hand, that Repentance and good Works are nece&s;&s;ary Conditions of obtain|ing it.</Q></P>
<P>The Di&s;tinction between good Works being the <HI>Fruits,</HI> but not the <HI>Condition</HI> of Ju&s;tification is meerly
<PB N="vi" REF="004499_0005_100D5AE151A59400">
eva&s;ive and trifling; &s;eeing Ju&s;tifying Faith and good Works cannot be &s;eperated, cannot be oppo&s;ed One to another, without rendering both u&s;ele&s;s and ineffectual: For in the plain Sen&s;e of Scripture, with|out holine&s;s no man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord, or without good Works be finally ju&s;tified in his &s;ight. And according to the 12<HI>th Article</HI> of our Church <HI>they are plea&s;ing &amp; acceptable to God in Chri&s;t.</HI> Nay this is the meaning of the 11<HI>th. Article,</HI> on which Mr. WH&mdash;D magi&s;terially impo&s;es his own Sen&s;e, and &s;pitefully cen&s;urs the Clergy for not implicitely recei|ving his indige&s;ted Notions; For when 'tis a&s;&s;erted, <Q>that we are accounted righteous before God, only for the merit of our Lord &amp; Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t, by Faith, and not for our own Works (<HI>viz.</HI> without Faith.)</Q> <HI>By Faith only</HI> an Evangelical Faith is mo&s;t certainly to be under&s;tood ; which always includes &s;incere, tho' not perfect, un&s;inning Obedience; as appears plain from the whole Tenour of the Go&s;pel. And farther our Church di&s;tinctly points out, in what Sen&s;e we are to under&s;tand all her Doctrines, in the 6<HI>th Article,</HI> <Q>Holy Scripture containeth all things nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation, So that what&s;oever is not read therein, nor may be proved thereby, is not to be required of any Man, that it &s;hould be believed as an Article of Faith, or be thought requi&s;ite or necce&s;&s;ary to Salvation.</Q></P>
<P>The pious &amp; learned Dr. <HI>Bull</HI> late <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> of <HI>St. Davids,</HI> in his <HI>Harmonia Apo&s;tolica,</HI> has fully proved that by the Word of the 11<HI>th Article,</HI> there is not attributed any Efficacy or Dignity to <HI>Faith,</HI> more
<PB N="vii" REF="004499_0006_100D5AE4DD85D4B0">
than to other great Go&s;pel Virtues, in the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Ju&s;tification; and has confirmed the &s;ame by the Suffrages of all the eminent Fathers of the primitive Church. And yet becau&s;e the <HI>Bi&s;hop of London</HI> re|commends this true, genuine, &s;criptural &amp; intelligible Notion of Faith; Mr. WH&mdash;D, with equal Truth &amp; Decency, calls him a <HI>Doctrinal-Papi&s;t,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Wh&mdash;d'<HI>s late Letter to the Religious Societies</HI></NOTE> (with this malicious <HI>Sneer</HI> and &s;landerous <HI>Accu&s;ation</HI> again&s;t every <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> in <HI>England</HI>) <Q>though One of the mo&s;t Orthodox Prelates in the Kingdom.</Q></P>
<P>To make preaching up the nece&s;&s;ity of good Works the Character of a <HI>Papi&s;t,</HI> mu&s;t proceed from very pernicious De&s;igns, or el&s;e be owing to gro&s;s Ig|norance both of the <HI>Prote&s;tant &amp; Popi&s;h</HI> Doctrines. Our <HI>Church</HI> both in her <HI>Articles &amp; Homilies</HI> a&s;&s;erts the <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of good Works, but renounces the <HI>Merit</HI> of them. The <HI>Church of Rome</HI> claims <HI>Merit</HI> by them, as appears from their Doctrine concerning Works of <HI>Supererogation.</HI> And yet by other Super|&s;titious Ceremonies, by Pardons &amp; Indulgences, and by one Device or another has enervated the Chri&s;tian Religion to that Degree, that it has lo&s;t its Virtue &amp; Efficacy upon the Minds &amp; Lives of men.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><HI>See Archbp.</HI> Tillot&s;ons <HI>Sermon</HI> 154. <HI>Vol.</HI> 3.</NOTE></P>
<P>The <HI>Church of Rome</HI> (&s;ays <HI>Dr. Bull</HI> Ser. I, Vol. I.) teacheth &amp; avoweth &s;uch Doctrine, as evidently &amp; utterly de&s;troyes the Nece&s;&s;ity of a holy

Life, &amp; encourageth Men to hope they &s;hall reap in Mercy, though they &s;ow not to them&s;elves in righte|ou&s;ne&s;s. Such is that Doctrine of theirs, That a Man by <HI>Attrition,</HI> or &s;uch a Sorrow for Sin, as ari&s;eth only from Fear, &amp; is void of Charity &amp; the Love of God above all things, with the help of the Sacrament of <HI>Penance,</HI> i. e. of Confe&s;&s;ion to, and Ab&s;olution from a Prie&s;t, may obtain the Pardon of his Sins, Ju&s;tification and eternal Life. <HI>Council</HI> of <HI>Trent Chap.</HI> 14 <HI>Se&s;&s;ion</HI> 14. He adds, that it may be truly affirmed, that there is no Society of Chri&s;tians in the World, where <HI>Antinomiani&s;m</HI> and <HI>Libertini&s;m</HI> more reign than among the <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> into who&s;e Faith they are interwoven, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Are not they then rather to be reckoned <HI>Doctri|nal Papi&s;ts,</HI> who zealou&s;ly decry Morality and the nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>good Works,</HI> who con&s;tantly pronounce <HI>Damnation</HI> again&s;t all that differ from them in Opi|nions; who maintain the Doctrine of private <HI>Au|ricular Confe&s;&s;ion</HI>; who pretend to <HI>infalibility,</HI> to be certainly &s;ure of their own Salvation, and to know the Hearts of others; or who are, and who are not <HI>regenerated</HI>; who decry <HI>Learning</HI> and the u&s;e of <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> and con&s;equently promote <HI>Ignorance</HI> and en|courage an <HI>Implicit Faith</HI>; who di&s;credit and run down the be&s;t <HI>Prote&s;tant Authors</HI> that have wrote with the greate&s;t Learning and Succe&s;s, again&s;t the Errors of the <HI>Church of Rome</HI>? I could mention o|ther Tenets and Practices of the like nature. But</P>
<P>I proceed to ob&s;erve, that Mr. <HI>W&mdash;d's</HI> Charge again&s;t; the Clergy, as a&s;&s;erting we are ju&s;tified by
<PB N="ix" REF="004499_0008_100D5AE81B0509B8">
<HI>Works only,</HI> is ab&s;olutely and &s;candalou&s;ly fal&s;e E|ven that great and good Man <HI>Arch Bi&s;hop Tillot&s;on</HI> (whom he has mo&s;t gro&s;ly abu&s;ed in this, as well as in other re&s;pects) in&s;i&s;ts upon it, that <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> and no other, has merited the Ble&s;&s;ings of Ju&s;tifica|tion and Salvation for us; that we our&s;elves can do nothing, whereby we can merit the&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings at Gods Hands; nay farther that all our Obedience is imperfect, and &s;o far from meriting, that it &s;tands in need of Pardon. See his 174th Sermon Vol. 3d.</P>
<P>The Author of the <HI>Whole Duty of Man</HI> (tho' as pious and u&s;eful a Book as ever was wrote, yet con|demned and de&s;troyed by Mr. <HI>W&mdash;d's</HI> Orders) &s;peaks fully to Chri&s;ts meriting in our behalf, by &s;atisfying the Divine Ju&s;tice for <HI>actual</HI> as well as <HI>original</HI> Sin, and purcha&s;ing an eternal and glori|ous Inheritance for all that repent, believe and faith|fully obey him, through the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of his holy Spirit.</P>
<P>But Mr. <HI>W&mdash;d</HI>'s Scheme of Chri&s;tianity ad|mits nothing to be required of us. I have heard him in <HI>expre&s;s Words</HI> declare, that good Works will not recommend us to God's Favour, nor will evil Works;, even all the Sins that ever were committed in the World, though center'd in one Soul, for one Mo|ment hinder its Ju&s;tification and Salvation. That we have free Will only to do evil, nay are meer Machines, and therefore cannot do any thing; or &s;hould we attempt to do any thing for our&s;elves, we thereby make our&s;elves half Saviours, and in
<PB N="x" REF="004499_0009_100D5AEA507E9C48">
that Ca&s;e &s;hould never be &s;aved through Chri&s;ts Me|rits. That Chri&s;t by his Obedience hath every Way fulfilled the Law for us, and God will not de&s;ire to be paid twice. That God will have no regard to Works pa&s;t, pre&s;ent or to come.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See his Letter to the Societies.</NOTE> That no Purity nor Impurity, no Fitne&s;s nor Unfitne&s;s are con&s;idered by him; That no Conditons are re|quired, and that the only Qualification is to be a Sinner; and the greater the Sinner, the better Saint he will make &amp;c.</P>
<P>What wild, di&s;tracted Notions are the&s;e? Into what dangerous Mazes may they lead well-meaning credulous Souls? I know &s;ome are willing to put ano|ther Meaning, on the&s;e, and the like irrational and un&s;criptural Po&s;itions, than what is plain and obvious. But' tis impo&s;&s;ible, by any Shifts and Eva&s;ions, to elude the evil tendency of them. Tho&s;e who fir&s;t taught the&s;e pernicious Doctrines, were called <HI>Anti|nomians</HI>; the name is now become odious and there|fore di&s;owned; but what &s;ignifies de&s;claiming the De|&s;ignation, it Men e&s;pou&s;e and propagate their di&s;tin|gui&s;hing Per&s;ua&s;ions, and darling Tenets? Tenets, by which the Grace of God may be, <HI>upon Principle,</HI> turned into wantone&s;s and Chri&s;tian Liberty be made a Cloak for all &s;orts of Sins, even the mo&s;t heinous Enormities. God, &s;avs, St <HI>Paul</HI> Rom. 2. 6. <HI>will render to every Man according to his Deeds.</HI> Tho' our good Works are not required to make
<PB N="xi" REF="004499_0010_100D5AEE36A96880">
us capable of meriting Heaven, (that being impo&s;&s;i|ble for frail, &s;inful Creatures) yet are they ab&s;olute|ly nece&s;&s;ary to make us fit Objects, for the infinite Mercy of God in Chri&s;t to be&s;tow Heaven, on; or to u&s;e St. <HI>Pauls</HI> elegant Expre&s;&s;ion. <HI>Col.</HI> I. 12. <HI>To make us meet to be partakers of the Inheritance of the Saints in Light.</HI> Know ye not &s;ays the &s;ame Apo&s;t.1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6. 9. <HI>That the Unrighteous &s;hall not inherit the King|dom of God?</HI> This is &s;o often and &s;o plainly incul|cated in the new Te&s;tament that he who runs, may read it; and they who know not this, know nothing of Chri&s;tianity, as they ought to know it.</P>
<P>To caution my Hearers again&s;t the Danger of mi&s;|taken Notions in this important Doctrine, was the End I chiefly propo&s;ed in the following Di&s;cour&s;es; which were ha&s;tily put togother, and are printed as they were preached; except &s;ome few Sentences in the afternoon Sermon purpo&s;ely pa&s;&s;ed over in the Delivery, which yet are nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve the Connexion. Mr. <HI>W&mdash;d</HI> heard them both; and from Church repaired to <HI>Society Hill,</HI> attended with great Numbers of every Per&s;ua&s;ion; where, after naming the &s;ame Text, your Preacher to day, &s;aid he, from the&s;e Words, &amp;c. And &s;o went on contra|dicting and preverting the Doctrines I had deliver'd, without any regard to Decency, or our ble&s;&s;ed Lords Precept <HI>Mat.</HI> 18. 15. And in direct Contempt of the 53d <HI>Cannon</HI> of our <HI>Church,</HI> whereby publick Oppo&s;ition between Preachers is &s;trictly forbidden; becau&s;e thereby may grow much Offence and Di&s;|quietne&s;s to the People. As actually happen'd in
<PB N="xii" REF="004499_0011_100D5AEFC207B6E0">
this particular In&s;tance; For &s;ome have ra&s;hly de|&s;erted the Communion of the Church implicitly o|beying his Schi&s;matical Advice <HI>viz.</HI> That they &s;hould follow &s;ome rigid Itinerant Di&s;tenters, whom he named, as the only Preachers of the <HI>true Go&s;pel</HI> in the&s;e Parts. He peremtorily a&s;&s;erted (and, it I am not mi&s;informed, backed the A&s;&s;ertion with his fa|miliar, tho' dreadful Imprecations again&s;t him&s;elf, if what he &s;aid was not &s;trictly true) that I had preached up the &s;ufficiency of an <HI>Hi&s;torical Faith</HI>; and had taught <HI>Ju&s;tification by Works only,</HI> And then very pathetically exhorted the People not to fol|low or li&s;ten to &s;uch Preachers. They teach, &s;aid he, the Doctrine of Devils; vile Doctrine that leads to the Gates of Hell and De&s;truction.</P>
<P>And &s;oon after in his Declamations, on the a|fore&s;aid <HI>Hill,</HI> to a numerous Audience, he confi|dently affirmed; That the <HI>Bi&s;hop of London</HI> and his <HI>Commi&s;&s;aries,</HI> and the pre&s;ent &s;et of <HI>Clergy</HI> neither under&s;tand nor believe their <HI>Articles</HI>; Do not ye therefore believe them; for they are <HI>Simon Magu&s;es.</HI> They are <HI>Sorcerers, Emi&s;&s;aries</HI> of the Devil; They are <HI>rotten Pillars,</HI> and have for the&s;e hundred Years pa&s;t, been pulling down the <HI>Church of England</HI> with their unhallowed Hands.</P>
<P>Now was this rude Language, this low Scurrility, this fal&s;e Accu&s;ation the Dictates of the <HI>holy and infallible Sprit,</HI> or of the <HI>Spirit that worketh in the Children of Di&s;obedience</HI>? Sure not of the former. Such vile and &s;landerous Invectives are <HI>Crimes</HI> doubt|le&s;s,

<HI>to be puni&s;h'd by the Judges</HI> being incon&s;i&s;tent with the <HI>Peace of Society</HI>; a notorious Breach of the <HI>ninth Commandment,</HI> and of his &s;olemn Engagement at his <HI>Ordination.</HI> The true Religion of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> teaches Men to live without Di&s;turbance, in that Society of which they are Members; to be o|bedient to its Con&s;titutions, and to be <HI>&s;ubject, for Con&s;cience &s;ake, to tho&s;e that have the Rule over them.</HI> St. <HI>Jude</HI> &s;everely cen&s;ures the <HI>Gno&s;ticks,</HI> (a Sect extraordinarily in&s;pired by their vain Pretences; but very profligate and irregular in their Practices) for their <HI>de&s;pi&s;ing Dominions, and &s;peaking evil of Dignities.</HI></P>
<P>It has always been the Method of Deceivers, to inveigh again&s;t received and orthodox Principles, and the Pa&s;tors that are regularly appointed to teach and maintain them: And 'tis a va&s;t advantage they gain over any People, when they can by art and Elocution re&s;train them from a rational Enquiry in|to the Doctrines, they pretend to deliver by In&s;pi|ration; and from li&s;tning to the In&s;tructions of their <HI>lawful Guides</HI>; whom they will labour hard to make them undervalue by &s;ecret Surmi&s;es, injurious A&s;per|&s;ions and unde&s;erved Reflexions.</P>
<P>As to the abu&s;ive Mi&s;repre&s;entation of me, or my Doctrine by Mr. <HI>W&mdash;d</HI>; Let his and my Superiors, and every impartial Man judge of it. I freely for|give him, and pray <HI>God</HI> forgive him, and re&s;tore him to a &s;ound Mind and regular Conduct. No|thing could have prevail'd with me, to have taken

this publick Notice of one capable of acting &s;o much out of Character; had it not been ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, in the con&s;cientious Di&s;charge of the Du|ty of my pre&s;ent Station, to caution the &s;erious and well-meaning, again&s;t being impo&s;ed upon and lead a&s;tray by tho&s;e, who are confident and ra&s;h, becau&s;e they are not rational: and &s;upply with Grimace, Noi&s;e and Pa&s;&s;ion, what they are known to want in Sen&s;e and Under&s;tanding; not to mention <HI>Learn|ing,</HI> that is at pre&s;ent, it &s;eems, an attainment de&s;|picable, if not dangerous to the owners.</P>
<P>However, Religious Truths are always be&s;t con|veyed by calmne&s;s of Rea&s;oning, and clearne&s;s of Argument. And it mu&s;t be owing to the want of due and &s;erious Attention, if Men do rot receive the mo&s;t u&s;eful and la&s;ting Edification, from Di&s;cour|&s;es calculated chiefly to inform their Under&s;tand|ings, and convince their Judgments. But &s;uch Di&s;|cour&s;es, to &s;ome even well meaning Hearers appear flat and un&s;avoury, and to have nothing in them of <HI>Life and Power.</HI> They can reli&s;h nothing, but what is delivered with eagerne&s;s and vehemence; what rai&s;es Tempe&s;ts and Earthquakes in their Brea&s;ts, like the <HI>Thunder and Lightning from Mount Sinai.</HI> They think them&s;elves better edified, when their Pa&s;&s;ions are only affected, and their Imagination heated by the moving Voice or Ge&s;ture of the Speak|er.

<Q>Yea a Man may &s;ay, Thou ha&s;t Faith, and I have Works; &s;hew me thy Faith without thy Works, and I will &s;hew thee my Faith by my Works.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Apo&s;tle &s;eems here to introduce, as it were, two Chri&s;tians; the one he &s;uppo&s;es to be <HI>Weak</HI> and <HI>Erroneous,</HI> the other <HI>Orthodox</HI> and <HI>well In|&s;tructed,</HI> and to repre&s;ent them as warmly engaged in &s;erious Di&s;cour&s;e concerning &s;ome fundamental points of Religion, particularly the Nature of <HI>Ju&s;tification</HI> &amp; the Means of obtaining it: The weak Chri&s;tian looks upon <HI>Faith</HI> alone as the only Means, and argues for the Sufficiency of it, tho' he &s;hould neglect to do <HI>Works</HI> an&s;werable and &s;uitable to his <HI>Faith</HI>: But the better in&s;tructed Chri&s;tian doth not think <HI>Faith</HI> alone Sufficient, if it be not accompanied with a &s;uitable Life and Conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>Both of them no doubt di&s;claim'd all pretence of <HI>Merit</HI> either in <HI>Faith</HI> or <HI>Works,</HI> and attributed (as we mu&s;t always do) the whole of our Salvation to the precious Death and meritorious Satisfaction of the holy <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> the Author and Fini&s;her of our <HI>Faith.</HI> Both of them were likewi&s;e agreed, that <HI>Faith</HI> was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation; but then, as I hinted ju&s;t now, they differed very much in their
Sentiments concerning the Nature and Sufficiency of it; for one thought <HI>Faith</HI> alone ab&s;olutely full, compleat and &s;ufficient; and on that account ima|gin'd

he might &s;afely &s;uper&s;ede his concern about maintaining <HI>Good Works,</HI> and proceeding daily in all holy Conver&s;ation and virtuous Actions; where|as the other rea&s;oning more ju&s;tly, was firmly per|&s;uaded that <HI>Faith</HI> could not be of a true and &s;aving Nature, could not be manife&s;ted in a right Manner, but by <HI>Good Works</HI> the genuine Fruits and Effects thereof.</P>
<P>This may &s;erve to repre&s;ent to us the very Ca&s;e of &s;ome zealous Profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity among our&s;elves; who, though they readily acknowledge and inculcate the nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>Faith</HI> and that they are under &s;trict Obligations to live and die therein, &s;eem notwith|&s;tanding, with the erroneous Chri&s;tian, to lay too great Stre&s;s upon their <HI>Faith</HI>; thinking, nay boa&s;ting, that they will be thereby &s;aved; tho' their Tempers be <HI>Uncharitable,</HI> and their Behaviour, in many re|&s;pects, <HI>Irregular</HI>; as if Speculative and bare Per|&s;ua&s;ion could &s;ave Chri&s;tians, without obeying the Evangelical Precepts.</P>
<P><HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Obedience</HI> are firmly joined together, and in&s;eperably connected by a moral efficiency, and have the Sanction from a divine Command; and 'tis therefore pre&s;umptuou&s;ly vain, extremely dangerous for any Man to flatter him&s;elf or &s;educe others into a fond Per&s;ua&s;ion, that ju&s;t, or even <HI>in&s;pired</HI> Notions of Religion, will avail them in the Sight of God, will ju&s;tify them according to the Terms of the Go&s;pel; whil&s;t they indulge them&s;elves in vice, are

ungodly, and walk di&s;orderly. Would Men but once &s;trive with a true and holy Zeal, who &s;hould be the be&s;t Chri&s;tian, who &s;hould keep at the greate&s;t di&s;tance from Sin and every appearance of evil, and who &s;hould &s;quare his Life mo&s;t exactly according to our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour's pure Precepts and holy Exam|ple: There would then be little room left, and le&s;s if any Inclination in the Minds of &s;erious Chri&s;tians, for the&s;e needle&s;s Controver&s;ies and unrea&s;onable Divi&s;ions with relation to <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Ju&s;tification, Free-Will</HI> and <HI>Free-Grace,</HI> which prevail too much at pre&s;ent, as they did in the <HI>la&s;t Century,</HI> to the di&s;|credit of <HI>true Religion</HI> and di&s;turbance of Society: Such Di&s;putes are too dry and intricate for u&s;eful In&s;truction; their natural tendency is to render Men confident and trouble&s;ome, proud and uncharitable; but never to make them either wi&s;er or better.</P>
<P>As Matters therefore &s;tand, we &s;hould look di|rectly to the End of <HI>Faith,</HI> that by it we may be partakers of the Benefits of Chri&s;ts Death and Imi|tatours of the Virtues of his Life. The be&s;t Ser|vice and Credit we can do our holy Religion is to give the World living Proofs of its Truth and Ex|cellency, and to defend and adorn it with a good, peaceable and exemplary Practice; for an inoffen&s;ive Demeanour, a Life of true Virtue and unaffected Piety will always have its effects; will in Time &s;top the Mouths of Gain-&s;ayers and conciliate the Opi|nions and Affections of Men even di&s;affected: For as the Apo&s;tle St. <HI>Peter</HI> ob&s;erves, <HI>we may by well-doing</HI>

<P>Having premi&s;ed this in order to explain my <HI>Text,</HI> I propo&s;e in my following Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>

<P>This may appear very plain, if we only con&s;ider, That <HI>Faith</HI> is the very Foundation of a religious and devout frame of Soul, the fir&s;t Principle of the Chri&s;tian Life, and the Ma&s;ter-Spring that excites and guides our &s;piritual Motions; without which no Man can be truly and &s;incerely Religious; <HI>For with|out Faith,</HI> &s;ays the Apo&s;tle to the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> 11 Ch. 6 ver.

of them <HI>that diligently &s;eek him.</HI> Now the&s;e two Expre&s;&s;ions, <HI>plea&s;ing God</HI> &amp; <HI>&s;eeking him,</HI> are plain|ly of the &s;ame Importance, and both of them &s;ignify Religion or the Wor&s;hip and Service of God; which doth antecedently &s;uppo&s;e our firm Belief and Per&s;ua&s;ion of tho&s;e two fundamental Principles of all Religion, whether natural or revealed, <HI>viz.</HI> that there is a <HI>God,</HI> and that he will Protect and Reward tho&s;e that faithfully Serve and Obey him, becau&s;e without Mens fir&s;t Believing the&s;e, there would be neither Ground nor Encouragement for any &s;uch thing as Religion. Hence the Apo&s;tle to the <HI>Cor.</HI> 13. 5. requires us <HI>to examine our&s;elves if we be in the Faith</HI>; we mu&s;t not be carele&s;s and indifferent in a Matter of &s;o great Weight and Moment, and that &s;o nearly concerns our eternal Intere&s;t and Welfare: For according to our <HI>Saviour's</HI> expre&s;s Declaration, <HI>Mark</HI> 16. 16. <HI>He that believeth and is baptized, &s;hall be &s;aved; but he that believeth not &s;hall be damned.</HI> And <HI>John</HI> 8. 24. <HI>If ye believe not that I am He</HI> (<HI>viz.</HI> the promi&s;ed Me&s;iah and Saviour of the World) <HI>ye &s;hall die in your Sins.</HI> It being the principle Act of this <HI>Faith,</HI> to believe that <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> is the Son of <HI>God,</HI> and the <HI>Saviour</HI> of Mankind; con&s;equently we mu&s;t e&s;teem his Doctrine to be pure, true and &s;acred; we mu&s;t receive it as &s;uch, and endeavour by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Gods Grace (which he has promi&s;ed to all them that ask it in Sincerity and Truth) to fulfil his holy Will and obey his Commandments; and he that thus <HI>Believeth on the Son of God, hath everla&s;ting Life, and he that

Believeth not the Son, &s;hall not &s;ee Life, but the wrath of God abideth on him, John</HI> 3. 18 and 36. And St. <HI>Paul</HI> tells us (2. <HI>The&s;&s;.</HI> 1. 8.) <HI>That God will take Vengeance on them that know him not, and that obey not the Go&s;pel of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> From hence appears both the Nece&s;&s;ity and Nature of <HI>Chri&s;tian Faith,</HI> which in&s;tructs us not only to be|lieve in <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> but al&s;o obliges us to embrace and obey that pure and undefiled Religion taught and in&s;tituted by him in the holy Go&s;pel. Any other Sen&s;e of <HI>believing in Chri&s;t</HI> mu&s;t needs be lame and imperfect, for what can it &s;ignify or avail to believe in him, if we flight the Religion of which he is the Author, and di&s;regard tho&s;e in&s;pir'd and faithful Re|cords of his Life and Rules of this Doctrine? The holy Scriptures were given for our Learning and written for our In&s;truction; and in the due u&s;e of Means, the <HI>Spirit of Truth</HI> will guide us into the &s;aving knowledge of what God has thought fit to re|veal, what he commands us to do, what he promi&s;es to the Obedient and threatens again&s;t the Negligent; that thereby we may be induced &s;eriou&s;ly to deny all ungodline&s;s and worldly Lu&s;ts, and to live <HI>righteou&s;ly, &s;oberly and godly in this pre&s;ent World.</HI></P>
<P>This is a true De&s;cription of that <HI>Faith,</HI> which is required by the perfect Revelation of Gods Will, and approves it&s;elf to the Rea&s;on of Mankind; tho' there are &s;ome who labour to render it ob&s;cure and unin|telligible.

which the Scripture requires, and in this Sen&s;e we mu&s;t under&s;tand the&s;e Phra&s;es, when we apply them to this Matter. This is the <HI>Faith</HI> which is nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation, in all that live under the Sun&s;hine of the Go&s;pel. As to tho&s;e who have not had it re|veal'd unto them, it would be ra&s;h and ill become us to pronounce any thing peremptorily concerning them; we mu&s;t not affect to be <HI>wi&s;e above what is written</HI>: However we may on the charitable, and therefore the &s;afe&s;t &s;ide, &s;uppo&s;e that God, who&s;e Goodne&s;s is over all his Works, may apply his <HI>un|covenanted Mercy</HI> unto them; and that tho' they do not believe in <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> of whom they have not heard, he may reckon them excu&s;able; the want of Op|portunity and external Revelation being a good Apo|logy in their behalf. But as to tho&s;e who have heard the glad Tidings of Salvation, who live where the Go&s;pel is taught in Purity and Truth, where the Evidences of Chri&s;tianity, and Motives to believe, ly &s;o open to the general Apprehen&s;ion of Mankind.

Among the Chri&s;tians he wrote to, were many <HI>Libertines</HI> who denied the nece&s;&s;ity of a Godly Life; and maintained that a bare Speculative <HI>Faith</HI> was enough to &s;ave them; and very probably had perverted &s;ome difficult Pa&s;&s;ages in St <HI>Pauls</HI> Epi&s;tles, to countenance &amp; &s;upport that their erroneous Doctrine; a Doctrine which St <HI>Paul</HI> him&s;elf decries in many Places, particularly telling the <HI>Corinthians</HI> (I Ep. 7. 19.) <HI>That nothing would avail then, but keeping the Commandments of God</HI>; and &s;aving of him&s;elf (1 <HI>Cor</HI> 13. 2.) <HI>Tho' I have all Faith&mdash;and have not Clarity I am nothing</HI>; and a Doctrine that flatly contradicts what our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour affirms concern|ing the de&s;ign of his appearance in the World, (Mat. 5. 17.) viz. <HI>That he came not to de&s;troy the Law,</HI> (the Moral Law) <HI>but to fulfil it</HI>; and accord|ingly when One asked him, <HI>What he &s;hould do to ob|tain eternal Life</HI>? his An&s;wer was, <HI>if thou wilt enter into Life, keep the Commandments.</HI> So that if we

will take the true Scheme and principle De&s;ign of Chri&s;tianity from <HI>him</HI> who fir&s;t in&s;tituted and be&s;t under&s;tood it; 'tis a <HI>practical</HI> not a bare <HI>Specula|tive Science,</HI> 'tis a &s;trict <HI>In&s;titution</HI> which, tho' it offers Pardon for what is pa&s;t, yet requires us to en|deavour after all purity of Heart and holine&s;s of Life for the future. <HI>It does not make void but e&s;tabli&s;hes the Law</HI>; and is &s;o far from di&s;pen&s;ing with Morality, that it has advanced it to the highe&s;t improvement, So groundle&s;s and ab&s;urd was the Opinion of tho&s;e <HI>Licentious Men</HI> who e&s;teemed them&s;elves exempted and di&s;charged through <HI>Faith,</HI> from the Practice of <HI>moral Duties.</HI> In Oppo&s;ition to this dangerous and wild Conceit, St <HI>James</HI> goes on to prove, that <HI>Faith</HI> when it doth not produce <HI>good Works</HI> is dead, lifele&s;s and unactive; and by nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equence is in|&s;ufficient to <HI>Ju&s;tification</HI> and <HI>Salvation.</HI> For this purpo&s;e he offers <HI>three</HI> or <HI>four</HI> plain and undeniable Arguments, in the Chapter of which my Text is a Part; <HI>viz.</HI> He &s;hews that <HI>Faith without Works is a dead Faith</HI>; because I&s;t, &s;uch a <HI>Faith</HI> is u&s;ele&s;s and and unprofitable: from the 14, to v. 18. Where he compares this kind of <HI>Faith</HI> to a Man, that fees his Neighbour nece&s;&s;itous and de&s;titute of daily Food; but tho' he is able, yet doth not afford him Things needful for his pre&s;ent relief, putting him off with a few formal good Wi&s;hes: In this Ca&s;e the poor Suppliant would receive no real Relief from his rich Neighbour. Even &s;o the Man that has <HI>Faith,</HI> and is not careful to <HI>maintain good Works,</HI> his <HI>Faith</HI> in the i&s;&s;ue can be no more profitable to him, than a few
<PB N="14" REF="004499_0029_100D5B1805184E58">
good Words from a rich uncharitable Man can be helpful to his poor, fami&s;hing Neighbour. For what can it benefit a Man to believe in <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> unle&s;s he lives and behaves him&s;elf as every &s;incere Chri&s;tian ought to do. The Act of <HI>Faith</HI> is, no doubt, good in it&s;elf; but if the Man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it, does no more good through its Influence than if he had it not; he may be &s;aid to have a good Gift, but is ne|ver the better for it: 'Tis like a Trea&s;ure which a Man hides in the Earth and there lets it remain, with|out ever u&s;eing it; and &s;o the Man reaps no more real good from it, than if he actually had it not. Such a <HI>Faith</HI> therefore as is not accompanied with <HI>good Works</HI> is no better than a <HI>dead Faith,</HI> becau&s;e it is u&s;ele&s;s and unprofitable.</P>
<P>The Doctrine of our <HI>final Ju&s;tification by Faith only,</HI> and by <HI>imputed Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> &s;o gro&s;sly explain'd, as to &s;uper&s;ede all our own Endeavours to obey Gods Laws, through Chri&s;t who &s;trengthens us; however comfortable it may be to &s;uch as are re&s;olved to live wickedly, and yet intend to get to Heaven at la&s;t, in a &s;horter and ea&s;ier Way than the true Go&s;pel-Scheme of Salvation has laid down; yet &s;ure I am, the Hopes of &s;uch <HI>Hypocrites will peri&s;h</HI>; for our ble&s;|&s;ed Saviour, who taught all nece&s;&s;ary Truth, &s;peaks no &s;uch comfort in his Sermons to <HI>impenitent Sin|ners</HI>; no, on the contrary he &s;everely threatens tho&s;e who continue in any known Sin, and break the lea&s;t of his Commandments; that they &s;hall <HI>not enter in|to the Kingdom of Heaven,</HI> Should the <HI>Solifidian</HI>

<HI>Scheme</HI> be embraced with all the ab&s;urd Con&s;equen|ces, as 'tis inculcated by <HI>Some</HI>; it could not fail (ac|cording to its natural tendency) to have a bad Effect upon Men's Manners: It would make them di&s;pa|rage <HI>virtuous Actions,</HI> and di&s;regard Morality, even <HI>Chri&s;tian Morality,</HI> as a mean and low attainment. This mu&s;t in &s;ome Degree ob&s;truct the <HI>Propagation of the Go&s;pel</HI>: and be an Ob&s;tacle to the Conver&s;ion of &s;en&s;ible and under&s;tanding Men either <HI>Jews</HI> or <HI>Heathens.</HI> How could we demon&s;trate to them the excellency of <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> or &s;hew them the advantage of it, or prevail with them to embrace it, if they mu&s;t renounce their <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> and part with their <HI>Mo|rality</HI> in the Exchange? This would de&s;ervedly re|nder it to <HI>the Jews a Stumbling Block, and to the Greeks Fooli&s;hne&s;s.</HI> This is moreover a rejecting the Commands of God (for which our Lord &s;everely re|prov'd the Phari&s;ees, <HI>Mark</HI> 7. 9.) that Men may <HI>keep their own Traditions,</HI> i.e. may &s;trictly adhere to the Prejudices and di&s;tingui&s;hing however un&s;crip|tural or unrea&s;onable Tenets of a Party. This is certainly in the mo&s;t obvious Sen&s;e <HI>to make void the Law of Faith,</HI> which is the Rule and Mea&s;ure whereby our Lives are to be reform'd and governed; becau&s;e if good Works are not nece&s;&s;ary to our Par|don and ju&s;tification, for what are they nece&s;&s;ary? And if they are not for our acceptance with God, or at all nece&s;&s;ary; what rea&s;on has any Man to concern or trouble him&s;elf about them? St <HI>Paul</HI> him|&s;elf rejects this wild Hypothe&s;is with great and ju&s;t abhorrence; <HI>Rom.</HI> 3. 31. <HI>Do we then make void</HI>

<HI>the Law thro' Faith? God forbid.</HI> God forbid in|deed that the Statutes of the Lord, which are right, pure and rejoice the Heart, &s;hould be abrogated and made void, and that too by <HI>Faith</HI>; by the Faith of the glorious Go&s;pel, that noble and excellent In&s;ti|tution for the Promotion of holine&s;s and happine&s;s among Men; that la&s;t and mo&s;t perfect Application of the <HI>Divine Phy&s;ician</HI> for the recovery and Re&s;to|ration of a &s;inful and degenerate World.</P>
<P>Again Ildly St <HI>James</HI> argues that <HI>Faith</HI> without Works is but a dead Faith, becau&s;e it cannot be &s;howen. It has no Proofs, no Evidences, is like a Cau&s;e without Effects; and for any thing that ap|pears, is as it were not exi&s;tent. This much the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> intimates in the Words of my Text, Saving <HI>&s;hew me thy</HI> Faith <HI>without thy Works; and I will &s;how thee my</HI> Faith <HI>by my Works.</HI> By which manner or Ex|pre&s;&s;ion 'tis manife&s;tly implied, that true <HI>Faith</HI> may be known by <HI>good Works,</HI> as a <HI>good Tree is known by good Fruits,</HI> but cannot without them. For in the Name of Goodne&s;s, how can he, that doth not practice according to his Profe&s;&s;ion, make it ap|pear that he believes what he pretends to be per&s;waded of? Is it not commonly ob&s;erved that Men act, even in their worldly Affairs, according to their real Per&s;ua&s;ions? Thus if any prudent Per&s;on firmly believes, that &s;ome particular acquaintance of his own will prove a good Friend, an u&s;eful Bene|factor to him; he will by all proper Means &s;eek to in|gratiate him&s;elf more &amp; more, &amp; to court and &s;ecure
<PB N="17" REF="004499_0032_100D5B1DF077AF30">
his Countenance and Favour. Or if one &s;hould be really per&s;waded, that at &s;uch a Time and &s;uch a Place, he &s;hall reap &s;ome con&s;iderable Benefit and Advantage, he will be &s;ure to give his punctual at|tendance, for fear of lo&s;ing &s;o fair an Opportunity; and &s;o it is in many other Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>If therefore Men pretend to be <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> and yet do not live as becomes the Di&s;ciples of the meek and holy <HI>Je&s;us.</HI> It they profe&s;s to believe the holy Scriptures, and yet do not ob&s;erve what they plain|ly teach and enjoin; if they are a&s;hamed of found religious Principles, becau&s;e they are run down by Numbers &amp; will not turn to pre&s;ent Account. Why, the&s;e are &s;hrew'd, nay certain Signs that they do not truely and really believe what they pretend, &s;o that <HI>Faith</HI> in this re&s;pect al&s;o is but a <HI>dead Faith</HI>; it brings forth no Fruit, has no proper Evidences to prove it; nay the want of good Works rather proves it to be only a fal&s;e, pretended and hypocritical <HI>Faith</HI>: For that Faith is only Fancy which thinks to be crown'd without Obedience. If our Principles and Practices be not of a Piece, if they do not mutu|ally &s;upport and adorn each other, we are not <HI>rai|&s;ed to newne&s;s of Life, but are &s;till dead in our Sins.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall only add at pre&s;ent, that without all doubt, our <HI>Ju&s;tification</HI> in this Life mu&s;t, proceed by the ve|ry &s;ame Mea&s;ures, that it will do at the <HI>la&s;t Day,</HI> when we &s;hall publickly receive it from the Mouth of our Supreme Judge; who hath before hand told

<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>JAMES II. 18.</BIBL>
<Q>Yea a Man may &s;ay, thou ha&s;t <HI>Faith</HI> and I have <HI>Works,</HI> &s;hew me thy <HI>Faith</HI> without thy <HI>Works,</HI> and I will &s;hew the my Faith by my <HI>Works.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AFter I had this Morning explain'd the&s;e Words, I &s;hew'd in the <HI>I&s;t Place,</HI> that <HI>Faith was ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation</HI>; becau&s;e it is the very Foundation of a religious and devout frame of Soul; the fir&s;t Principle of the Chri&s;tian Life, and the Ma&s;ter Spring that excites and guides our &s;piritual Motions, towards the attainment of everla&s;ting Sal|vation: For according to our <HI>ble&s;&s;ed Saviours</HI> expre&s;s Declaration, <HI>He that believeth and is baptized &s;hall be &s;aved; and if ye believe not that I am he,</HI> (<HI>viz.</HI> the promi&s;ed Me&s;&s;iah) <HI>ye &s;hall die in your Sins.</HI> Un|belief affronts <HI>God,</HI> and is a manife&s;t Contempt of our <HI>Saviours</HI> Goodne&s;s, and does what it can to defeat his gracious De&s;igns to &s;ave Man|kind.</P>
<P>In the <HI>IId Place</HI> I propo&s;ed to &s;hew, that <HI>Faith alone</HI> is not &s;ufficient unto Salvation unle&s;s it be ac|companied with <HI>good Works</HI>; &s;uch Works as the precepts of the Go&s;pel enjoin and require, when St. <HI>Paul</HI> affirms <HI>we are ju&s;tified by Faith,</HI> he means an
<PB N="20" REF="004499_0035_100D5AA29048CED8">
active and lively Faith, which approves it&s;elf by a &s;incere Obedience, and that too rendered ea&s;y and practicable by the Succours of Heaven, by the Grace and Strength of our <HI>Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> The A|po&s;tle St. <HI>James</HI> proves in this Chapter, that <HI>Faith</HI> when it does not produce <HI>good Works,</HI> is dead, life|le&s;s and unactive, and by a nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equence is in&s;ufficient to <HI>Ju&s;tification</HI> and <HI>Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t Argument which he makes u&s;e of to this purpo&s;e is ver. 14. The <HI>Faith</HI> that Ju&s;tifies mu&s;t not only be a bare A&s;&s;ent of the Under&s;tanding to the Go&s;pel, but mu&s;t include Obedience to the Com|mands thereof; and if it does not, it no more de|&s;erves the Name of <HI>Faith,</HI> than good Words to a Man in want de&s;erves the Name of <HI>Charity.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>IId Argument</HI> is contain'd in my <HI>Text,</HI> which proves that <HI>Faith may he &s;hew'd by good Works, but cannot without them.</HI> A Man may pretend that he believes; but if his Practice be di&s;greble to his Profe&s;&s;ion, 'tis the &s;hrewde&s;t Sign in the World, that he does not believe what he pretends. If our Prin|ciples and Practices do not mutually &s;upport and a|dorn each other, we are not rai&s;ed to newne&s;s of Life, but are &s;till dead in our Sins. But to pro|ceed,</P>
<P>A <HI>IIId Argument</HI> is advanced in the Context, to prove that <HI>Faith without Works is but a dead Faith</HI>; becau&s;e it is no more, nor nothing better, than what even <HI>Devils</HI> them&s;elves have. This St. <HI>James</HI>
<PB N="21" REF="004499_0036_100D310354E34A40">
plainly intimates in the 19, and 20 ver.&mdash;<HI>Thou be|lieve&s;t,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>that there is one God, thou do'&s;t well; the Devils al&s;o believe and tremble.</HI> Are the&s;e wick|ed and unclean Spirits not de&s;titute of Faith; what a woeful and de&s;perate Condition then mu&s;t &s;uch a|monq Chri&s;tians be in, who continue in a State of gro&s;s or affected Infidelity; not only void of Faith, but Oppo&s;ers of it too? Seeing in this Ca&s;e, they not only fall &s;hort of the Attainments of <HI>Devils</HI>; but al&s;o go as great, if not greater, lengths in their Enmity to <HI>Faith</HI> the Faith of the Go&s;pel; for the <HI>Devils both believe and tremble.</HI> We read in the Oracles of &s;acred Truth, that the&s;e evil Spirits have &s;everal Times made open Confe&s;&s;ion of &s;ome of the prime Articles of the Chri&s;tian Faith; Thus <HI>Mark</HI> 1. 24. <HI>the unclean Spirits its fell down before</HI> Chri&s;t, <HI>and confe&s;&s;ed him to be</HI> Je&s;us <HI>of</HI> Nazareth, <HI>the holy One of God.</HI> And Ch. 5. 7. The Legion of Devils which entred into the Herd of Swine, acknowledged that <HI>Je&s;us was the Son of the mo&s;t high God.</HI> Thus likewi&s;e the Dam&s;el, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a Spirit of Di|vination, told the People of St. <HI>Paul</HI> and his Com|panions; that <HI>the&s;e Men were the Servants of the mo&s;t high God, which &s;hew unto us the way of Salva|tion,</HI> Acts 16. 17.</P>
<P>From all which it undeniably appears, that the Devils are not de&s;titute of Faith, &s;ince they have confe&s;&s;ed that Chri&s;t is the Son of God; and that his Go&s;pel and the Doctrine of the Apo&s;tles in&s;truct us how to walk in the Paths of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, that lead directly to the Gates of Heaven. The&s;e are
<PB N="22" REF="004499_0037_100D31056598F830">
<HI>prime Articles</HI> of the Chri&s;tian Faith: But can any Man be &s;o ab&s;urd, as to think he can be <HI>ju&s;tified and &s;aved,</HI> whil&s;t he has nothing more to qualify him for, or to intitle him to Salvation, than tho&s;e impure Spi|rits have? Can any Man be &s;o unrea&s;onable, as to imagine, <HI>that Faith</HI> wil be &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify him before God, which carries him no greater length than what the&s;e accur&s;ed Spirits have attain'd to? They have Faith, but want obedience; they can be|lieve, it &s;eems, but cannot do well; whereas Men, by Gods preventing and a&s;&s;i&s;ting Grace, can both believe and do well, if they be not wanting to them|&s;elves in the u&s;e of the nece&s;&s;ary and appointed Means. And therefore if, when God enables them, they re|&s;i&s;t his Spirit, and will not endeavour to do more than Devils; what are they better, I had almo&s;t &s;aid how much wor&s;e are they than the&s;e?</P>
<P>The <HI>IVth Argument</HI> urged by St. <HI>James,</HI> to prove; that <HI>Faith alone is not &s;ufficient to Salvation</HI>; is, be|cau&s;e 'tis different from, and unlike to that <HI>Faith,</HI> which God approved in his Saints and faithful Ser|vants of old. Thus he in&s;tances in <HI>Abraham</HI> and <HI>Rahab,</HI> (ver. 21 and 25.) who were approved of, and rewarded by God, for &s;hewing their Faith by their Works. As to <HI>Abraham,</HI> was not he, &s;ays the Apo&s;tle, <HI>ju&s;tified by works</HI> (proceeding from his Faith) he believed God, &s;hew'd his Faith, very great Faith in Gods Power and Promi&s;es, by leaving his Country and Friends, by offering his Son, his <HI>only Son I&s;aac,</HI> and paying an entire Obedience to God's Commands, however &s;eemingly &s;evere they
<PB N="23" REF="004499_0038_100D5A7A90CB6870">
were. The <HI>Faith which produced the&s;e good Works was imputed to him for Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI>; and upon that account he was called the Friend of God.</P>
<P>And as to <HI>Rahab,</HI> was not &s;he, &s;ays St. <HI>James, ju&s;tified by Works</HI> (proceeding from her Faith) <HI>when &s;he had received the Me&s;&s;engers and &s;ent them out a|nother way.</HI> That &s;he had a &s;trong Faith in God, the Apo&s;tle to the <HI>Hebr.</HI> 11. 31. te&s;tifies, and &s;he her&s;elf declared it &s;aying, Jo&s;h. 2. 11. <HI>The Lord your God, he is God in Heaven above and in Earth beneath</HI>; and becau&s;e &s;he believed that God would give the Land of <HI>Canaan</HI> to his peculiar People the I&s;ralites, &s;he therefore acted according to her belief, and receiv'd into her Hou&s;e the Men that were &s;ent to &s;py out the Land; where &s;he concealed them from their Enemies, and &s;aved them from falling into their Hands; and by &s;o doing pre&s;erved her&s;elf and Fa|mily from the De&s;truction that fell upon the City of <HI>Jericho,</HI> where &s;he dwelt.</P>
<P>Now if our Faith were like theirs as lively, &s;trong and vigorous; the Effects of it too would be as great, vi&s;ible and con&s;picuous, had we the like Occa&s;ion to &s;hew it. Were we thoroughly and habitually pe&s;|&s;uaded that all the precepts of our Religion are the expre&s;s Laws of the ever-living Sin-revenging God; and that all the Promi&s;es and Threatnings of the Go&s;pel will one Day be verified and made good; what manner of Per&s;ons would we &s;trive to be in <HI>all holy Con&s;ervation and Godline&s;s</HI>? How would the lively Hopes of another World rai&s;e us above the
<PB N="24" REF="004499_0039_100D5A7C518C6E80">
Vanities of this pre&s;ent Life; and &s;et us out of the reach of the mo&s;t powerful Temptations, that this World can a&s;&s;ault us withal: Such a Faith would certainly induce us to do all things with a view to Eternity, with a due Regard to that &s;olemn and aw|ful Account we mu&s;t all one Day make to the Sovereign Judge of the whole Univer&s;e. Such a Faith would never &s;uffer us to be bia&s;ed by worldly Intere&s;t or &s;elf|i&s;h Views, in Oppo&s;ition to &s;acred Truth, to Chri&s;tian Unity, and to the Dictates of a well-inform'd Con|&s;cience, that faithful Monitor and Gods Vicegerent within us. <HI>Abrahams</HI>'s outward Actions declared his inward Principles; his Obedience was proportioned to his Faith; becau&s;e the one was &s;trong and lively, the other was con&s;tant and uniform; becau&s;e his Faith was not &s;taggered, he was called the <HI>Father of the Faithful</HI>; and became an illu&s;trious Example to o|thers of &s;incere per&s;evering Obedience in the mo&s;t difficult In&s;tance. <HI>Now,</HI> faith the Lord, <HI>I know that thou love&s;t me: becau&s;e thou ha&s;t not witheld thy Son, thine only Son from me.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides this Example, in the 11th Ch. to the <HI>Hebr.</HI> there is recorded a large Catalogue of Saints, who &s;hew'd their Faith by their Works. <HI>Abel</HI> the fir&s;t that &s;uffered for Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Piety towards God, <HI>by Faith offered a more excellent and acceptable sacrifice. Enoch</HI>'s Faith had &s;o good an influence on his Life, that by a virtuous Conver&s;ation he <HI>plea&s;ed God, and was tran&s;lated into Heaven.</HI> By Faith <HI>Noah</HI> was preserved from two general Deluges, the one of Sin, the other of Water overflowing the
