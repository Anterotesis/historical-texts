<HEAD>A LETTER To the REVEREND Mr. <HI>James Davenport, Pa&s;tor</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> of CHRIST, in SOUTH-HOLD, on LONG-ISLAND, now in BOSTON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Reverend Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR coming to BOSTON, under the influence of <HI>impul&s;es</HI> and <HI>impre&s;&s;ions,</HI> taking them for a <HI>call</HI> from GOD; and your manner of conduct &s;ince you have been in town, (conformable in &s;ome mea&s;ure to what it has been in other places) was the oc|ca&s;ion of my &s;tudying, and preaching, and afterwards giving way to the publication of the following <HI>Sermon:</HI> And, as I think, there is that in it, which may be a <HI>word in &s;ea&s;on</HI> to a gentleman of your ca&s;t of mind, I herewith make a pre&s;ent of it to you; and &s;hall be glad, if it may be of &s;ervice to you, as I hope it will to others, guarding them again&s;t the wilds of a heated imagination.</P>
<P>When you came to my hou&s;e, &s;ome days ago, to in|quire into the <HI>rea&s;on of the hope that was in me,</HI> my in|tention was, to deal plainly and faithfully with you:
<PB N="ii" REF="004912_0004_100E192A0BAAF040">
And I believe, you do not think, I was wanting upon that head. Whether you heard what I then &s;aid with <HI>pity towards me,</HI> or becoming <HI>reflections on your &s;elf,</HI> I know not: Time may di&s;cover which. But whatever the working of your mind was, I am abundantly con|firm'd in it, that your <HI>real</HI> character was fairly laid open before you.</P>
<P>I doubt not, you verily think, GOD &s;ent you hither; and that your preaching here is by <HI>immediate</HI> commi&s;|&s;ion from <HI>him</HI>: But others mu&s;t be excus'd, if they han't the &s;ame tho't of the matter. They are in the opinion, <HI>your own &s;tock</HI> is <HI>your proper charge</HI>; and can't ea&s;ily be bro't to believe, that GOD would <HI>call</HI> you to leave them, without making way for their &s;upply in the mean time. This, you may think, <HI>he</HI> has done: But others are of a different mind; tho&s;e, to be &s;ure, are &s;o, who know what a <HI>weak, raw, illiterate, young man,</HI> you have &s;ent to them; one, who lived in the&s;e parts, and gave &s;uffi|cient proof of his <HI>ignorance,</HI> and <HI>ra&s;hne&s;s,</HI> and <HI>unskillfull|ne&s;s,</HI> as well as other things, I &s;han't here mention.</P>
<P>But that, more e&s;pecially, which &s;ati&s;fies me, as well as many others, that you are mi&s;led in the tho't of being &s;ent by GOD, in an <HI>extraordinary</HI> manner, to this place, is, the <HI>mi&s;chief</HI> you are like to do here. What good you may have been the means of el&s;ewhere; I know not: But I am well a&s;&s;ured, in&s;tead of <HI>good,</HI> you will be the <HI>occa&s;ion</HI> of much <HI>hurt,</HI> to the intere&s;t of religion in the&s;e churches. Your <HI>manner</HI> in &s;peaking, as well as <HI>what you &s;ay,</HI> &s;eems rather calculated, at lea&s;t at &s;ome times, to di&s;turb the <HI>imagination,</HI> than inform the <HI>judgment</HI>: And I am fully per&s;waded, you too often mi&s;take the <HI>mechanical</HI> operations of <HI>violent voice</HI> and <HI>action,</HI> for im|pre&s;&s;ions of another kind. Some are not without fear, lea&s;t by your imprudencies, you &s;hould do much to|wards bringing <HI>conver&s;ion,</HI> the very <HI>name</HI> of it, into contempt. 'Tis certain, many good people are offend|ed; and tho&s;e, who have no &s;erious concern about re|ligion, are in danger of throwing it off, as a wild, di&s;or|derly, imaginary bu&s;ine&s;s. And if, by your extravagant conduct, you &s;hould excite &s;uch prejudices in the minds of people again&s;t chri&s;tianity, as &s;hould unhappily prove
<PB N="iii" REF="004912_0005_100E1958EB72B610">
the <HI>occa&s;ion</HI> of their ruin, would it not afford ju&s;t ground of the mo&s;t &s;evere reflections on your &s;elf?</P>
<P>The preaching of CHRIST <HI>crucified,</HI> may be, 'tis true, <HI>a &s;tumbling-block</HI> to &s;ome, and <HI>fooli&s;hne&s;s</HI> to others; and the <HI>preachers,</HI> at the &s;ame time, <HI>a &s;weet &s;avour to</HI> GOD, even <HI>in them that peri&s;h.</HI> But how will this ju&s;tify <HI>real weakne&s;&s;es,</HI> and <HI>ju&s;t occa&s;ions of offence?</HI> If, under the no|tion of <HI>preaching</HI> CHRIST, men will run into open im|prudencies, and &s;et religion in &s;uch an <HI>ugly light</HI> by their <HI>unguarded conduct,</HI> as eventually i&s;&s;ues in great damage to men's <HI>&s;ouls,</HI> they are certainly chargeable with it; and to a greater degree of guilt, than they may be &s;uffi|ciently aware of. <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;tic wildne&s;s has &s;lain its thou&s;ands.</HI> This, Sir, de&s;erves your mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;i|deration. And while you are &s;o ready to fa&s;ten on o|thers the guilt of the <HI>blood of &s;ouls,</HI> it would not be ami&s;s, if you were a little more critical in examining, how far you may, <HI>your &s;elf,</HI> be guilty in the like kind. This is a momentous affair. And <HI>&s;elf-deceit</HI> will be no more ex|cu&s;able in you, than in others. <HI>Be not high-minded, but fear.</HI> Encourage a jealou&s;y of your &s;elf, at lea&s;t, &s;o far as to look over your conduct, and compare it faithfully with that <HI>grand rule</HI> of trial, the <HI>word of</HI> GOD. <HI>I bear you record, you have a zeal of</HI> GOD; but if, in any great in|&s;tances, 'tis a zeal not governed by <HI>knowledge,</HI> or not tempered with <HI>prudence,</HI> or not accompanied with <HI>charity,</HI> you may, be you ever &s;o confident you are in the right, bring guilt upon your &s;elf, as well as do hurt to others.</P>
<P>Your de&s;ign, in going thro' the <HI>town,</HI> from one mi|ni&s;ter to another, to examine into their <HI>religious expe|riences,</HI> you have begun to open. You have not in|deed, as yet, <HI>particularly</HI> pronounced &s;entence, and call'd upon people, (as has been your u&s;ual way) to <HI>&s;e|perate</HI> from <HI>this</HI> and the <HI>other</HI> mini&s;ter, as being in a <HI>carnal</HI> &s;tate; tho', if I have been rightly inform'd, you have, in general, <HI>addre&s;s'd to</HI> GOD <HI>in prayer,</HI> as to him <HI>who knew, that the greate&s;t part of the mini&s;ters in town were unconverted.</HI> How far this may tend to prejudice people again&s;t their <HI>mini&s;try,</HI> I can't certainly &s;ay; but I have no &s;uch apprehen&s;ion of your importance, as to be afraid of any great inconvenience ari&s;ing herefrom.
<PB N="iv" REF="004912_0006_100E192B8DD84BD8">
Some over zealous per&s;ons may be made &s;till more un|charitable; but by far the better part of the town, both for <HI>number,</HI> and <HI>&s;olid piety,</HI> are aware of this <HI>device of &s;atan</HI>; and, I tru&s;t, upon their guard again&s;t any bad impre&s;&s;ions from it. I am therefore more concern'd for <HI>you,</HI> than in fear of any hurt you are capable of doing the <HI>mini&s;ters.</HI> You are certainly in a wrong way of thinking, or you would not be able, with the name of GOD in your mouth, to violate that &s;olemn &s;tatute of heaven, JUDGE NOT.</P>
<P>Suffer me, <HI>Sir,</HI> to take this opportunity, to be&s;eech you in the bowels of CHRIST JESUS, and as you re|gard your own &s;oul, to review your conduct in this matter of <HI>ra&s;h, and uncharitable judging</HI> You know, how ma|ny <HI>worthy mini&s;ters</HI> you have publickly condemned, as <HI>carnal</HI> and <HI>unconverted</HI>; tho', &s;o far as is vi&s;ible, they have been <HI>an example of the believers, in word, in con|ver&s;ation, in charity, in &s;pirit, in faith, in purity</HI>: And you know al&s;o, how, by this means, you have ob&s;tructed their u&s;efulne&s;s; alienated the hearts of their people from them; and encouraged heats and animo&s;ities, which have ari&s;en, in &s;ome places, to open divi&s;ions and &s;epa|rations. And can you reflect upon this, and be ea&s;y in your mind? Have you had no mi&s;givings of heart? No in<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">rd relentings? No &s;ecret twinges of con&s;cience? <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">an't but think, this has been, at times, the ca&s;e with you. I am &s;ure, if you han't been in trouble of &s;oul, 'tis not becau&s;e you han't had ju&s;t rea&s;on to be &s;o: And I believe, if ever GOD gives you a <HI>&s;ound mind,</HI> you will <HI>cry to him from the deeps,</HI> for this &s;trange conduct you have unhappily fallen into.</P>
<P>You will doubtle&s;s &s;ay, you are in the right; you are &s;ure of it: Your mind has been <HI>impre&s;&s;ed</HI> by the DI|VINE SPIRIT; and you act in this matter, under his <HI>&s;pecial influence.</HI> But is this any more than every <HI>en|thu&s;ia&s;t</HI> may plead in vindication of his conduct, be it e|ver &s;o wild? What &s;ays the apo&s;tle PAUL, who &s;pake under the <HI>in&s;piration of</HI> GOD? Does he not bring the pretences of every man, who calls him&s;elf SPIRITUAL, he pretends to a <HI>more than ordinary guidance</HI> of the SPIRIT, to the &s;tandard of <HI>&s;cripture,</HI> to be tried by that
<PB N="v" REF="004912_0007_100E195AA601C068">
<HI>unerring rule?</HI> And are you able to &s;tead the tryal by <HI>this book</HI> of God? What is there, in the &s;acred volumes, that will ju&s;tify your going about, from one part of the country to another, enquiring into the &s;tate of the &s;ouls, particularly, of <HI>mini&s;ters,</HI> and declaring them, mo&s;t com|monly, unconverted; Tho' they don't open their <HI>hearts</HI> to you, and their <HI>lives</HI> give credit to their profe&s;&s;ion? What is <HI>judging another man's &s;ervant,</HI> if this is not? And how can you be &s;aid, while you act thus, to be in the exerci&s;e of <HI>charity,</HI> that <HI>charity</HI> which <HI>thinketh no evil, believeth all things, hopeth all things?</HI> Is there any meaning to the&s;e texts? Can per&s;ons be at all guilty of the &s;in of uncharitable judging? 'Tis hard to &s;ay, where|in they can be guilty, if you are not.</P>
<P>You may, perhaps, plead the danger of an <HI>unconver|ted mini&s;try</HI> to the &s;ouls of men. But be the danger of this as great as it will, it can never be a good rea&s;on, why you &s;hould a&s;&s;ume a <HI>divine prerogative,</HI> and act as tho' you were the <HI>con&s;tituted judge</HI> of your brethren. 'Tis true, where mini&s;ters make a di&s;covery of a <HI>bad heart,</HI> by that which is <HI>outwardly bad,</HI> they may ju&s;tly be condemned: But in no other ca&s;e; to be &s;ure, not <HI>pub|lickly.</HI> We have no way of judging but by what is <HI>outward</HI> and <HI>vi&s;ible</HI>: Nor are we capable of judging any other way. And to leave this way, and go into that of judging from <HI>men's hearts</HI>; it tends to nothing, in the nature of things, but to de&s;troy the peace of churches, and fill the world with contention and confu&s;ion: And of this you have had proof in your own conduct; &s;ufficient, if you will &s;uitably attend to it, to work conviction in you.</P>
<P>But this you cannot do, while you give heed to <HI>im|pul&s;es,</HI> and guide your &s;elf by them, taking them for di&s;coveries of the will of GOD. Your <HI>grand error</HI> lies here: And 'tis a more dangerous one, than you may be ready to imagine. There is nothing, while in this &s;tate of mind, but you may be bro't to: And how far GOD may &s;uffer you to be led a&s;ide, is known only to him&s;elf. Others, who have appear'd as zealous for CHRIST as you have done, have been as bold and da|ring in judging their neighbours, as much under an <HI>ima|ginary</HI> divine conduct in every thing, and as &s;ure of it
<PB N="vi" REF="004912_0008_100E192E660A6F10">
as you have been, have at length run into all the wilds of delu&s;ion. I beg, <HI>Sir,</HI> you would take warning! Whatever you may think of your &s;elf, you have cer|tainly a <HI>heated imagination.</HI> 'Tis too evident to be de|nied, that you too often take the <HI>motions of your own mind,</HI> for <HI>divine communications.</HI> A flagrant in&s;tance of this, you gave your hearers not long &s;ince, when you told them, it was <HI>impre&s;&s;ed upon your mind,</HI> that the <HI>day of judgment was at the door,</HI> and you were as <HI>&s;ure of it</HI> as of &s;ome things you then &s;aw with your eyes. A <HI>thou|&s;and enthu&s;ia&s;ts</HI> have deluded them&s;elves and others with the <HI>&s;ame impre&s;&s;ion,</HI> looking upon it as a <HI>revelation</HI> from GOD: And you might have known it to have been a <HI>vain imagination,</HI> if you had only con&s;idered, that the <HI>knowledge</HI> of the <HI>time</HI> of the <HI>judgment</HI> is a <HI>&s;ecret,</HI> the FATHER hath &s;o re&s;erved in <HI>his own brea&s;t,</HI> as that the SON HIMSELF, as <HI>man,</HI> was <HI>ignorant</HI> of it: And if this day is to come <HI>unawares,</HI> and as a <HI>thief in the night,</HI> you could never be <HI>called</HI> of GOD to give warning of the <HI>time</HI> of <HI>its approach.</HI> To be &s;ure, if your <HI>impre&s;&s;ion</HI> about the <HI>nearne&s;s</HI> of the <HI>judgment</HI> was from GOD, your <HI>propo&s;al</HI> &s;oon after it, to <HI>rai&s;e monies</HI> for the building a <HI>&s;chool,</HI> or <HI>college,</HI> under the name of a <HI>Shepherd's Tent,</HI> that the churches might be &s;upplied with <HI>converted mi|ni&s;ters,</HI> mu&s;t be own'd to have had its ri&s;e from <HI>meer fancy</HI>: And this, no doubt, will generally be the tho't of the <HI>town</HI> upon it; e&s;pecially, if what is commonly &s;aid, be true, that one of the per&s;ons to be concern'd in the management of this affair, is a gentleman that has been lately <HI>turn'd out of the mini&s;try,</HI> becau&s;e among o|ther things, he &s;pake mo&s;t contemptuou&s;ly of the <HI>holy &s;criptures.</HI>&mdash;But I mu&s;t not be too long.</P>
<P>And now, having &s;poken my mind &s;o freely, if you deal with me as you have done with much better men, I may expect to be called a poor, carnal, unconverted wretch. But I a&s;&s;ure you beforehand, I e&s;teem it a <HI>very &s;mall thing to be judged by your Judgment</HI>; and the ra|ther, becau&s;e I <HI>certainly know,</HI> you are ignorant of my &s;tate towards GOD.</P>
<P>But however you act towards me, I pre&s;ume not to <HI>judge you. To your own ma&s;ter you &s;tand, or fall.</HI> I have
<PB N="vii" REF="004912_0009_100E195D14CBCE88">
taken notice only of <HI>that</HI> in you, which is <HI>vi&s;ible</HI> to the world; And tho' I have, and do condemn it, as what is oppo&s;ite to the plain laws of GOD; yet, I pronounce no &s;entence re&s;pecting <HI>your &s;tate.</HI> GOD knows how far you may be under the power of a <HI>di&s;turbed imagination,</HI> and will make all the favourable allowances your ca&s;e will admit of: I de&s;ire to do &s;o al&s;o, and would hope the be&s;t concerning you.</P>
<P>I &s;hall add no more but a couple of pa&s;&s;ages, I think well worthy your &s;erious con&s;ideration. One is from Mon&s;ieur BANAGE, in his <HI>La Communion Sainte,</HI> page 554, 555. Where &s;peaking of a &s;ett of men in <HI>France,</HI> he &s;ays, <Q>They look upon their neighbours to be more wicked than they really are, and think them&s;elves better than they really are.

One would think GOD had committed his ju&s;tice into the hands of the&s;e rigo|rous &s;piritual men, who are oftentimes more melan|choly than holy, that &s;o they might exerci&s;e it with &s;upreme authority. Were it even true, that you were the depo&s;itaries of divine ju&s;tice, don't you know that this depo&s;itum were dangerous in your hands? Wo to him that abu&s;es it, that acts by pa&s;&s;ion, or that judges with ra&s;hne&s;s. <HI>Judge not,</HI> &s;ays the SAVIOUR of the world; for <HI>with what judgment ye judge ye &s;hall be judged.</HI> By what right do you violate the law of your ma&s;ter? And why do you judge, when it is forbidden?</Q></P>
<P>The other pa&s;&s;age is from the famous Mr. JOHN DA|VEN PORT, my <HI>predece&s;&s;or,</HI> and your <HI>great-grand-father.</HI> In a <HI>manu&s;cript &s;ermon</HI> of his, having admoni&s;hed the church of GOD, under trouble&s;ome exerci&s;es, he goes on in the&s;e words, &mdash;&mdash;<Q>But then, would you prevent &s;uch exerci&s;es for the future, know your duties and do them; neither <HI>out-running your calling by an inordinate zeal,</HI> nor being too &s;low in di&s;charging the duties of it.

&s;hew of them. From this vain glorious tem|per proceeded the forwardne&s;s of tho&s;e that had the <HI>gift</HI> of <HI>tongues,</HI> to &s;peak in languages which others did not under&s;tand, to the di&s;turbance, rather than edification of the church: And from the &s;ame principle it aro&s;e, that they &s;pake not by turns, but &s;everal at once, in the &s;ame place of wor&s;hip, to the introducing &s;uch confu&s;ion, that they were in danger of being tho't mad.</P>
<P>Nor were they without &s;ome pretence to ju&s;tify the&s;e di&s;orders. Their great plea was, that in the&s;e things they were guided by the Spirit, acted under his imme|diate influence and direction. This &s;eems plainly in&s;i|nuated in the words I have read to you. <HI>If any man think him&s;elf to be a prophet, or &s;piritual, let him acknow|ledge that the things that I write unto you are the com|mandments of the Lord.</HI> As if the apo&s;tle had &s;aid, you may imagine your &s;elves to be <HI>&s;piritual</HI> men, to be un|der a divine afflatus in what you do; but 'tis all ima|gination, meer pretence, unle&s;s you pay a due regard to the <HI>commandments</HI> I have here <HI>wrote to you</HI>; receiv|ing them not as the <HI>word of man, but of</HI> GOD. Make trial of your &s;piritual pretences by this rule: If you can &s;ubmit to it, and will order your conduct by it, well; otherwi&s;e you only cheat your&s;elves, while you think your&s;elves to be <HI>&s;piritual</HI> men, or <HI>prophets</HI>: You are nothing better than <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;ts</HI>; your being acted by the SPIRIT, immediately guided and influenced by him, is meer pretence; you have no good rea&s;on to believe any &s;uch thing.</P>
<P>From the words thus explained, I &s;hall take occa&s;ion to di&s;cour&s;e to you upon the following Particulars.</P>
<P N="1">I. I &s;hall give you &s;ome account of <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m,</HI> in its <HI>nature</HI> and <HI>influence.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. Point you to a rule by which you may judge of per&s;ons, whether they are under the influence of <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. Say what may be proper to guard you again&s;t this unhappy turn of mind.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="004912_0013_100E19612B7411B8">The whole will then be follow'd with &s;ome &s;uitable Application.</P>
<P N="1">I. I am in the fir&s;t place, to give you &s;ome account of <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m.</HI> And as this is a thing much talk'd of at pre&s;ent, more perhaps than at any other time that has pa&s;s'd over us, it will not be tho't unrea&s;onable, if I take &s;ome pains to let you into a true under&s;tanding of it.</P>
<P>The word, from it's Etymology, carries in it a good meaning, as &s;ignifying <HI>in&s;piration from</HI> GOD: in which &s;en&s;e, the prophets under the old te&s;tament, and the a|po&s;tles under the new, might properly be called <HI>Enthu|&s;ia&s;ts.</HI> For they were under a divine influence, &s;pake as moved by the HOLY GHOST, and did &s;uch things as can be accounted for in no way, but by recurring to an immediate extraordinary power, pre&s;ent with them.</P>
<P>But the word is more commonly u&s;ed in a bad &s;en&s;e, as intending an <HI>imaginary,</HI> not a <HI>real</HI> in&s;piration: accor|ding to which &s;en&s;e, the <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;t</HI> is one, who has a conceit of him&s;elf as a per&s;on favoured with the extra|ordinary pre&s;ence of the <HI>Deity.</HI> He mi&s;takes the work|ings of his own pa&s;&s;ions for divine communications, and fancies him&s;elf immediately in&s;pired by the SPIRIT of GOD, when all the while, he is under no other influence than that of an over-heated imagination.</P>
<P>The cau&s;e of this <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;m</HI> is a bad temperament of the blood and &s;pirits; 'tis properly a di&s;ea&s;e, a &s;ort of mad|ne&s;s: And there are few; perhaps, none at all, but are &s;ubject to it; tho' none are &s;o much in danger of it as tho&s;e, in whom <HI>melancholy</HI> is the prevailing ingredient in their con&s;titution. In the&s;e it often reigns; and &s;ome|times to &s;o great a degree, that they are really be&s;ide them&s;elves, acting as truly by the blind impetus of a wild fancy, as tho' they had neither rea&s;on nor under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>And various are the ways in which their <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;m</HI> di&s;covers it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Sometimes, it may be &s;een in their countenance. A certain wildne&s;s is di&s;cernable in their general look and
<PB N="4" REF="004912_0014_100E1934E436D408">
air; e&s;pecially when their imaginations are mov'd and fired.</P>
<P>Sometimes, it &s;trangely loo&s;ens their tongues, and gives them &s;uch an energy, as well as fluency and volu|bility in &s;peaking, as they them&s;elves, by their utmo&s;t efforts, can't &s;o much as imitate, when they are not un|der the enthu&s;ia&s;tick influence.</P>
<P>Sometimes, it affects their bodies, throws them into convul&s;ions and di&s;tortions, into quakings and tremblings. This was formerly common among the people called <HI>Quakers.</HI> I was my&s;elf, when a Lad, an eye-witne&s;s to &s;uch violent agitations and foamings, in a boi&s;terous fe|male &s;peaker, as I could not behold but with &s;urprize and wonder.</P>
<P>Sometimes, it will unaccountably mix it&s;elf with their conduct, and give it &s;uch a tincture of that which is freaki&s;h or furious, as none can have an idea of, but tho&s;e who have &s;een the behaviour of a per&s;on in a phrenzy.</P>
<P>Sometimes, it appears in their imaginary peculiar inti|macy with heaven. They are, in their own opinion, the &s;pecial favourites of GOD, have more familiar con|ver&s;e with him than other good men, and receive immediate, extraordinary communications from him. The tho'ts, which &s;uddenly ri&s;e up in their minds, they take for &s;ugge&s;tions of the SPIRIT; their very fancies are divine illuminations; nor are they &s;trongly inclin'd to any thing, but 'tis an impul&s;e from GOD, a plain re|velation of his will.</P>
<P>And what extravagances, in this temper of mind, are they not capable of, and under the &s;pecious pretext too of paying obedience to the authority of GOD? Many have fancied them&s;elves acting by immediate warrant from heaven, while they have been committing the mo&s;t undoubted wickedne&s;s. There is indeed &s;carce any thing &s;o wild, either in <HI>&s;peculation</HI> or <HI>practice,</HI> but they have given unto it: They have, in many in&s;tances,
<PB N="5" REF="004912_0015_100E196409171E30">
been bla&s;phemers of GOD, and open di&s;turbers of the peace of the world.</P>
<P>But in nothing does the <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;m</HI> of the&s;e per&s;ons di&s;cover it &s;elf more, than in the di&s;regard they expre&s;s to the Dictates of <HI>rea&s;on.</HI> They are above the force of argument, beyond conviction from a calm and &s;ober ad|dre&s;s to their under&s;tandings. As for them, they are di&s;tingui&s;h'd per&s;ons; GOD him&s;elf &s;peaks inwardly and immediately to their &s;ouls. <Q>They &s;ee the light infu|&s;ed into their under&s;tandings, and cannot be mi&s;taken; 'tis clear and vi&s;ible there, like the light of bright &s;un|&s;hine; &s;hews it &s;elf and needs no other proof but its own evidence. They feel the hand of GOD moving them within, and the impul&s;es of his SPIRIT; and cannot be mi&s;taken in what they feel. Thus they &s;upport them&s;elves, and are &s;ure rea&s;on hath nothing to do with what they &s;ee and feel. What they have a &s;en&s;ible experience of, admits no doubt, needs no probation</Q>. And in vain will you endeavour to con|vince &s;uch per&s;ons of any mi&s;takes they are fallen into. They are certainly in the right; and know them&s;elves to be &s;o. They have the SPIRIT opening their under|&s;tandings and revealing the truth to them. They be|lieve only as he has taught them: and to &s;u&s;pect they are in the wrong is to do di&s;honour to the SPIRIT; 'tis to oppo&s;e his dictates, to &s;et up their own wi&s;dom in oppo&s;ition to his, and &s;hut their eyes again&s;t that light with which he has &s;hined into their &s;ouls. They are not therefore capable of being argued with; you had as good rea&s;on with the wind.</P>
<P>And as the natural con&s;equence of their being thus &s;ure of every thing, they are not only infinitely &s;tiff and tenacious, but impatient of contradiction, cen&s;o|rious and uncharitable: they encourage a good opinion of none but &s;uch as are in their way of thinking and &s;peaking. Tho&s;e, to be &s;ure, who venture to debate with them about their errors and mi&s;takes, their weak|ne&s;&s;es and indi&s;cretions, run the hazard of being &s;tig|matiz'd by them as poor unconverted wretches, with|out the SPIRIT, under the government of carnal rea&s;on, enemies to GOD and religion, and in the broad way to hell.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="004912_0016_100E1936DABD90D8">They are likewi&s;e po&s;itive and dogmatical, vainly fond of their own imaginations, and invincibly &s;et up|on propagating them: And in the doing of this, their Powers being awakened, and pu<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> as it were, upon the &s;tretch, from the &s;trong impre&s;&s;ions they are under, that they are authorized by the immediate command of GOD him&s;elf, they &s;ometimes exert them&s;elves with a &s;ort of <HI>extatic</HI> violence: And 'tis this that gives them the advantage, among the le&s;s knowing and judicious, of tho&s;e who are mode&s;t, &s;u&s;picious of them&s;elves, and not too a&s;&s;uming in matters of con&s;cience and &s;alvation. The extraordinary fervour of their minds, accompanied with uncommon bodily motions, and an exce&s;&s;ive con|fidence and a&s;&s;urance, gains them great reputation a|mong the populace; who &s;peak of them as <HI>men of GOD</HI> in di&s;tinction from all others, and too commonly heark|en to, and revere their dictates, as tho' they really were, as they pretend, immediately communicated to them from the DIVINE SPIRIT.</P>
<P>This is the nature of <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m,</HI> and this its opera|tion, in a le&s;s or greater degree, in all who are under the influence of it. 'Tis a kind of religious Phrenzy, and evidently di&s;covers it &s;elf to be &s;o, whenever it ri&s;es to any great height.</P>
<P>And much to be pitied are the per&s;ons who are &s;eiz|ed with it. Our compa&s;&s;ion commonly works towards tho&s;e, who, while under di&s;traction, fondly imagine them&s;elves to be Kings and Emperors: And the like pity is really due to tho&s;e, who, under the power of <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;m,</HI> fancy them&s;elves to be <HI>prophets; in&s;pired of God,</HI> and <HI>immediately called</HI> and <HI>commi&s;&s;ioned by him to deliver his me&s;&s;ages to the world:</HI> And tho' they &s;hould run into di&s;orders, and act in a manner that cannot but be condemned, they &s;hould notwith&s;tanding be treated with tenderne&s;s and lenity; and the rather, becau&s;e they don't commonly act &s;o much under the influence of a <HI>bad mind,</HI> as a <HI>deluded imagination.</HI> And who more worthy of chri&s;tian pity than tho&s;e, who, under the notion of &s;erving GOD and the intere&s;t of religion, are filled with zeal, and exert them&s;elves to the utmo&s;t, while all the time they are hurting and
<PB N="7" REF="004912_0017_100DEFCD43C55118">
wounding the very cau&s;e they take &s;o much pains to ad|vance. 'Tis really a pitiable ca&s;e: And tho' the hone&s;ty of their intentions won't legitimate their bad actions, yet it very much alleviates their guilt: We &s;hould think as favourably of them as may be, and be di&s;pos'd to judge with mercy, as we would hope to obtain mercy.</P>
<P>But I come</P>
<P N="2">II In the &s;econd place, to point you to a <HI>rule</HI> by which you may judge of per&s;ons, whether they are <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;ts,</HI> meer pretenders to the immediate guidance and influence of the SPIRIT. And this is, in general, <HI>a regard to the bible, an acknowledgment that the things therein contained are the commandments of GOD.</HI> This is the rule in the text. And 'tis an infallible rule of tryal in this matter: We need not fear judging ami&s;s, while we keep clo&s;ely to it.</P>
<P>'Tis true, it wont certainly follow, that a man, pre|tending to be a <HI>prophet,</HI> or <HI>&s;piritual,</HI> really is &s;o, if he owns the <HI>bible,</HI> and receives the truths therein reveal|ed as the mind of GOD: But the conclu&s;ion, on the other hand, is clear and certain; if he pretends to be conducted by the SPIRIT, and di&s;regards the &s;cripture, pays no due reverence to <HI>the things there delivered as the commandments of GOD,</HI> he is a meer pretender, be his pretences ever &s;o bold and confident, or made with ever &s;o much &s;eeming &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, gravity, or &s;olem|nity.</P>
<P>And the rea&s;on of this is obvious; viz that the things contained in the &s;cripture were wrote by holy men as they were moved by the HOLY GHOST: they were received from GOD, and committed to writing under his immediate, extraordinary influence and gui|dance. And the divine, ever-ble&s;&s;ed SPIRIT is con|&s;i&s;tent with him&s;elf. He cannot be &s;uppos'd to be the author of any <HI>private</HI> revelations that are contradictory to the <HI>public &s;tanding</HI> ones, which he has pre&s;erved in the world to this day. This would be to &s;et the SPI|RIT of truth at variance with him&s;elf; than which a greater reproach can't be ca&s;t upon him. 'Tis there|fore as true, that tho&s;e are <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;tical,</HI> who pretend
<PB N="8" REF="004912_0018_100E193A67EC4E70">
to the SPIRIT, and at the &s;ame time expre&s;s a di&s;regard to the &s;cripture, as that the SPIRIT is the great revealer of the things therein declared to us. And we may de|pend upon the certainty of this conclusion. We have warrant to do &s;o from the <HI>in&s;pired Paul</HI>; and we have the more rea&s;on to rely upon the rule he has given us, as he has made it evident to the world, that he was a <HI>prophet,</HI> and <HI>&s;piritual,</HI> by &s;igns and wonders which he did before the people, by the power of the SPIRIT of GOD.</P>
<P>But the <HI>rule</HI> in the text is yet more particular. It refers e&s;pecially to <HI>the things wrote by the apo&s;tle</HI> PAUL, and which he wrote to the <HI>church</HI> of <HI>Corinth,</HI> to rectify the <HI>di&s;orders</HI> that had crept in among them. And who|ever the per&s;on be, that pretends to be <HI>&s;piritual,</HI> to be under the extraordinary guidance of the SPIRIT, and yet acts in contradiction to what the apo&s;tle has here wrote, he vainly imagines him&s;elf to be under the &s;pe|cial guidance of the SPIRIT; he is a downright <HI>enthu|&s;ia&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>And here &s;uffer me to make particular mention of &s;ome of the things, the apo&s;tle has wrote in <HI>this Epi&s;tle,</HI> which, whoever will not acknowledge, in <HI>deed</HI> as well as <HI>word,</HI> to be the <HI>commandments of GOD,</HI> they are not guided by the SPIRIT, but vainly pretend to be &s;o.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing, in this kind, I would mention, is that which relates to <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI>; condemning an undue preference of one to another, the holding one in &s;uch admiration as to reflect di&s;grace on another. This was one of the di&s;orders the Apo&s;tle takes notice of, as pre|vailing in the <HI>church</HI> of <HI>Corinth</HI>; and he is particular in his care to give check to this unchri&s;tian &s;pirit, which had crumbled them into parties, and introduced among them faction and contention.</P>
<P>Now, whoever, under the pretence of being guided by the &s;pirit, &s;et up one mini&s;ter in oppo&s;ition to ano|ther glory in this mini&s;ter to the throwing undue con|tempt on that, thereby ob&s;tructing his u&s;efulne&s;s, and making way for &s;trife and divi&s;ions, they are not really
<PB N="9" REF="004912_0019_100E196908A6EF70">
acted by the SPIRIT, whatever they may pretend. For they evidently contradict what the apo&s;tle has wrote upon this very head: And if <HI>he</HI> was in&s;pired, the &s;pirit <HI>they</HI> are influenced by, cannot be the SPIRIT of <HI>GOD.</HI></P>
<P>Not that one mini&s;ter may not be preferr'd to ano|ther; this is rea&s;onable: But no mini&s;ter ought to be regarded, as tho' he was the author of our faith; nor, let his gifts and graces be what they will, is he to be &s;o e&s;teemed, as that others mu&s;t be neglected, or treated in an unbecoming manner. But I &s;hall not enlarge here, having &s;poken fully to this point, in a Sermon you may, &s;ome of you, have in your hands.</P>
<P>Another thing the apo&s;tle is particular in writing up|on, is the <HI>commandment</HI> of <HI>charity.</HI> And this he de|clares to be a matter of &s;uch e&s;&s;ential importance in true chri&s;tianity, that if a man is really de&s;titute of it, he is nothing in the &s;ight of GOD: Nay, tho' his pretences, his attainments, his gifts, be ever &s;o extraordinary or miraculous; &s;till, if he is without charity he will cetainly be rejected of GOD and the LORD JESUS CHRIST. This is beautifully repre&s;ented in the three fir&s;t ver&s;es of the 13th chapter of this Epi&s;tle, in &s;ome of the bolde&s;t figures. "Tho' I &s;peak, &s;ays the apo|&s;tle&punc; with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as &s;ounding bra&s;s, or a tink|ling cymbal. And tho' I have the gift of prophecy, and under&s;tand all my&s;teries and all knowledge; and tho' I have all faith, &s;o that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. And tho' I be&s;tow all my goods to feed the poor, and tho' I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me no|thing." As if the apo&s;tle had &s;aid, tho' a man had the languages of all nations, and could &s;peak with the elo|quence of angels; tho', like an in&s;pired prophet, he had under&s;tanding in the deep coun&s;els of GOD, and knew even all things &s;acred and divine; tho' he had the faith of miracles, and could do impo&s;&s;ibilities; tho' he had the zeal of a martyr, and &s;hould give his body to be burned; tho' he had a di&s;po&s;ition to alms-giving, and &s;hould be&s;tow upon the poor his whole &s;ub&s;tance;
<PB N="10" REF="004912_0020_100E193CD80742A8">
&s;till, if he was without charity, "that charity which &s;uffereth long, and is kind; that charity which envyeth not, vaunteth not it &s;elf, is not puffed up; that charity which behaveth not it &s;elf un&s;eemly, &s;eeketh not her own, is not ea&s;ily provoked, thinketh no evil, rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; that charity, in fine, which beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things"; I &s;ay, if he was without this charity, this love of his neighbour, the&s;e things would be all nothing; he would notwith|&s;tanding be out of favour with GOD, without any inte|re&s;t in CHRIST&punc; and in &s;uch circum&s;tances, as that un|le&s;s there was a change in them, he would certainly peri&s;h.</P>
<P>This, in &s;um, is what the apo&s;tle has, in a di&s;tinct and peremptory manner, delivered concerning charity.</P>
<P>And in vain may any pretend to be under the ex|traordinary guidance of the SPIRIT, while in their practice they trample upon this law of chri&s;tian love. Men may talk of their <HI>impul&s;es</HI> and <HI>impre&s;&s;ions,</HI> con|ceive of them as the call of GOD, and go about, as moved by them, from place to place, imagining they are &s;ent of GOD, and immediately commi&s;&s;ioned by him: But if they are cen&s;orious and uncharitable; if they harbour in their minds evil &s;urmi&s;ings of their bre|thren; if they &s;lander and reproach them; if they claim a rights to look into their hearts, make it their bu&s;ine&s;s to judge of their &s;tate, and proclaim them hy|pocrites, carnal unregenerate &s;inners, when at the &s;ame time they are vi&s;ibly of a good conver&s;ation in CHRIST; I &s;ay, when this is the practice of any, they do not acknowledge what the in&s;pired PAUL has here <HI>wrote as the commandment of GOD</HI>: They are not therefore acted by the &s;ame SPIRIT with which he &s;pake; but are evidently under a &s;pirit of delu&s;ion: And this is &s;o obviou&s;ly the ca&s;e, that there is no rea&s;onable room to doubt upon the matter.</P>
<P>Charity, my brethren, is the commandment of the go&s;pel by way of eminence. 'Tis the grand mark by which chri&s;tians are to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves from all
<PB N="11" REF="004912_0021_100E196C4B733E70">
others. <HI>By this,</HI> &s;ays our SAVIOUR<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John 13.35.</NOTE>, <HI>&s;hall all men know that ye are my di&s;ciples, if ye have love to one another:</HI> Yea, this is the grand criterion by which we are to judge, whither GOD <HI>dwelleth in us by his SPIRIT. If we love one another, GOD dwelleth in us</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">1 John 4.12.</NOTE>. And in the following Ver&s;e, <HI>Hereby,</HI> i e. by our loving one another, <HI>we know that we dwell in him, and he in us, becau&s;e he hath given us of his SPIRIT.</HI> To pretend therefore that we are led by the SPIRIT, and are un|der his extraordinary influence, when, in contradicti|on to the plain laws of JESUS CHRIST, revealed by the SPIRIT, we <HI>judge our brother,</HI> and <HI>&s;et at naught our brother,</HI> and plead a right to do &s;o, and are in a di&s;po&s;i|tion TO THANK GOD, THAT WE ARE ENABLED TO DO SO; there is not a more &s;ure mark, in all the revelations of GOD, of a BAD HEART, or a DISTEM|PERED MIND. If any thing will evidence a man to be a <HI>prophet</HI> and <HI>&s;piritual,</HI> only in his own conceit, this mu&s;t do it: And if this is not allow'd to be &s;ufficient proof, there is no knowing, when a man is under the influence of <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;tick</HI> heat and zeal.</P>
<P>Another thing the apo&s;tle be&s;peaks this church upon, is that <HI>&s;elf-conceit</HI> which appear'd among them in the exerci&s;e of <HI>&s;piritual gifts</HI>: And 'tis more than probable, there were tho&s;e among them, who being vainly puffed up in their minds, behaved as tho' they were <HI>apo&s;tles,</HI> or <HI>prophets,</HI> or <HI>teachers</HI>; leaving their own &s;tation, and do|ing the work that was proper to others. It was to rectify &s;uch di&s;orders, that the apo&s;tle, in the 12th chapter, addre&s;&s;es to them in that language, v. 29. <HI>Are all apo&s;tles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers?</HI> The que&s;tion carries with it it's own an&s;wer, and means the &s;ame thing, as when he affirms in the foregoing ver&s;e <HI>God hath &s;et &s;ome in the church, fir&s;t apo&s;tles, &s;econdarily prophets, thirdly teachers,</HI> and &s;o on. 'Tis evident from what the apo&s;tle here writes, and indeed from the cur|rent &s;train of this whole chapter, that there is in the body of CHRIST, the Church, a di&s;tinction of members; &s;ome intended for one u&s;e, others for another; and that it would bring confu&s;ion into the <HI>body my&s;tical,</HI> for one
<PB N="12" REF="004912_0022_100E193EB414A828">
member to be employed in that &s;ervice which is adapt|ed to another, and is its proper bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>'Tis not therefore the pretence of being moved by the SPIRIT, that will ju&s;tify <HI>private chri&s;tians</HI> in quit|ing their own proper &s;tation, to act in that which be|longs to another.

<P>I might go on and warn you from the danger of it to your&s;elves. If you &s;hould once come under the influ|ence of it, none can tell whither it would carry you.

<P>But as the mo&s;t &s;uitable guard again&s;t the fir&s;t tenden|cies towards <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;m,</HI> let me recommend to you the following words of coun&s;el.</P>
<P N="1">1. Get a true under&s;tanding of the <HI>proper work of the</HI> SPIRIT; and don't place it in tho&s;e things wherein the go&s;pel does not make it to con&s;i&s;t. The work of the SPI|RIT is different now from what it was in the fir&s;t days of chri&s;tianity. Men were then favoured with the extra|ordinary pre&s;ence of the SPIRIT. He came upon them in miraculous gifts and powers; as a &s;pirit of prophecy, of knowledge, of revelation, of tongue, of miracles: But the SPIRIT is not now to be expected in the&s;e ways. His grand bu&s;ine&s;s lies in preparing men's minds for the grace of GOD, by true <HI>humiliation,</HI> from an apprehen&s;ion of &s;in, and the nece&s;&s;ity of a <HI>Saviour</HI>; then in working in them <HI>faith</HI> and <HI>repentance,</HI> and &s;uch a <HI>change</HI> as &s;hall <HI>turn them from the power of &s;in and &s;atan unto</HI> GOD; and in fine, by carrying on the good work he has begun in them; a&s;&s;i&s;ting them in duty, &s;trengthening them again&s;t temp|tation, and in a word, pre&s;erving them blamele&s;s thro' faith unto &s;alvation: And all this he does by the <HI>word</HI> and <HI>paayer,</HI> as the great means in the accompli&s;hment of the&s;e purpo&s;es of mercy.</P>
<P>Herein, in general, con&s;i&s;ts the work of the SPIRIT. It does not lie in giving men <HI>private revelations,</HI> but in opening their minds to under&s;tand the <HI>publick ones</HI> con|tained in the &s;cripture. It does not lie in <HI>&s;udden impul|&s;es</HI> and <HI>impre&s;&s;ions,</HI> in <HI>immediate calls</HI> and <HI>extraordinary mi&s;&s;ions.</HI> Men mi&s;take the bu&s;ine&s;s of the SPIRIT, if
<PB N="17" REF="004912_0027_100E197152B2DD80">
they under&s;tand by it &s;uch things as the&s;e. And 'tis, probably, from &s;uch unhappy mi&s;takes, that they are at fir&s;t betrayed into <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;m.</HI> Having a wrong notion of the <HI>work of</HI> the SPIRIT, 'tis no wonder if they take the uncommon &s;allies of their own minds for his influences.</P>
<P>You cannot, my brethren, be too well acquainted with what the <HI>bible</HI> makes the <HI>work</HI> of the HOLY GHOST, in the affair of &s;alvation: And if you have upon your minds a clear and di&s;tinct under&s;tanding of this, it will be a powerful guard to you again&s;t all <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;tical im|pre&s;&s;ions.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Keep clo&s;e to the <HI>Scripture,</HI> and admit of nothing for an impre&s;&s;ion of the SPIRIT, but what agrees with that unerring rule. Fix it in your minds as a truth you will invariably abide by, that the <HI>bible</HI> is the grand te&s;t, by which every thing in religion is to be tried; and that you can, at no time, nor in any in&s;tance, be under the guidance of the SPIRIT of GOD, much le&s;s his <HI>extraordinary</HI> guidance, if what you are led to, is in|con&s;i&s;tent with the things there revealed, either in point of <HI>faith</HI> or <HI>practice.</HI> And let it be your care to com|pare the motions of your minds, and the workings of your imaginations and pa&s;&s;ions, with the <HI>rule</HI> of GOD's <HI>word.</HI> And &s;ee to it, that you be impartial in this matter: Don't make the rule bend to your pre-conceiv'd no|tions and inclinations; but repair to the <HI>bible,</HI> with a mind di&s;pos'd, as much as may be, to know the truth as it lies nakedly and plainly in the <HI>&s;cripture</HI> it &s;elf. And whatever you are moved to, reject the motion, e|&s;teem it as nothing more than a vain fancy, if it puts you upon any method of <HI>thinking,</HI> or <HI>acting,</HI> that can't be evidently reconcil'd with the <HI>revelations</HI> of GOD in <HI>his word.</HI></P>
<P>This adherence to the bible, my brethren, is one of the be&s;t pre&s;ervatives again&s;t <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;m.</HI> If you will but expre&s;s a due reverence to this <HI>book</HI> of GOD, making it the great rule of judgment, even in re&s;pect of the SPIRIT's <HI>influences</HI> and <HI>operations,</HI> you will not be in much danger of being led into delu&s;ion. Let that be your inquiry under all &s;uppos'd <HI>impul&s;es</HI> from the SPI|RIT,
<PB N="18" REF="004912_0028_100E1945714D79A8">
<HI>What &s;alth the &s;cripture? To the law, and to the te&s;timony:</HI> If your impre&s;&s;ions, and imagined &s;piritual motions agree not therewith, 'tis becau&s;e there is no hand of the SPIRIT of GOD in them: They are only the workings of your own imaginations, or &s;omething wor&s;e; and mu&s;t at once, without any more ado, be rejected as &s;uch.</P>
<P N="3">3. Make u&s;e of the <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> and <HI>Under&s;tanding</HI> GOD has given you. This may be tho't an ill-advis'd direction, but 'tis as nece&s;&s;ary as either of the former. Next to the <HI>Scripture,</HI> there is no greater enemy to <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;m,</HI> than <HI>rea&s;on.</HI> 'Tis indeed impo&s;&s;ible a man &s;hou'd be an <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;t,</HI> who is in the ju&s;t exerci&s;e of his under&s;tanding; and 'tis becau&s;e men don't pay a due regard to the &s;ober dictates of a well inform'd mind, that they are led a&s;ide by the delu&s;ions of a vain imagination. Be advi&s;ed then to &s;hew your&s;elves men, to make u&s;e of your rea&s;onable powers; and not act as the <HI>hor&s;e</HI> or <HI>mule,</HI> as tho' you had no under|&s;tanding.</P>
<P>'Tis true, you mu&s;t not go about to &s;et up your own <HI>rea&s;on</HI> in <HI>oppo&s;ition</HI> to <HI>revelation</HI>: Nor may you enter|tain a tho't of making <HI>rea&s;on</HI> your <HI>rule</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>&s;cripture.</HI> The <HI>bible,</HI> as I &s;aid before, is the <HI>great rule</HI> of religion, the grand te&s;t in matters of &s;alvation: But then, you mu&s;t u&s;e your rea&s;on in order to under&s;tand the <HI>bible:</HI> Nor is there any other po&s;&s;ible way, in which, as a rea&s;onable creature, you &s;hou'd come to an under|&s;tanding of it.</P>
<P>You are, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, in a corrupt &s;tate. The fall has introduc'd great weakne&s;s into your rea|&s;onable nature. You can't be too &s;en&s;ible of this; nor of the danger you are in of making a wrong judgment, thro' prejudice, carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, and the undue influence of &s;in and lu&s;t. And to prevent this, you can't be too &s;ol|licitous to get your <HI>nature &s;anctified</HI>: Nor can you de|pend too &s;trongly upon the divine grace to a&s;&s;i&s;t you in your &s;earch after truth: And 'tis in the way of due dependance on GOD, and the influences of his SPIRIT, that I advi&s;e you to the u&s;e of your rea&s;on: And in this way, you mu&s;t make u&s;e of it. How el&s;e will you
<PB N="19" REF="004912_0029_100E19749AA0CD90">
know what is a revelation from GOD? What &s;hou'd hinder your entertaining the &s;ame tho't of a <HI>pretended</HI> revelation, as of a <HI>real</HI> one, but your rea&s;on di&s;covering the fal&s;hood of the one, and the truth of the other? And when in the enjoyment of an undoubted revela|tion from GOD, as in the ca&s;e of the <HI>&s;cripture,</HI> How will you under&s;tand its meaning, if you throw by your rea&s;on? How will you determine, that this, and not that, is its true &s;en&s;e, in this and the other place? Nay, if no rea&s;oning is to be made u&s;e of, are not all the &s;en&s;es that can be put on &s;cripture equally proper? Yea, may not the mo&s;t contrary &s;en&s;es be receiv'd at the &s;ame time &s;ince rea&s;on only can point out the incon|&s;i&s;tency between them? And what will be &s;ufficient to guard you again&s;t the mo&s;t mon&s;trous extravagan|cies, in <HI>principle</HI> as well as <HI>practice,</HI> if you give up your under&s;tandings? What have you left, in this ca&s;e, to be a check to the wantone&s;s of your imaginations? What &s;hou'd hinder your following every idle fancy, 'till you have lo&s;t your&s;elves in the wilds of fal&s;hood and incon&s;i&s;tency?</P>
<P>You may, it is true, mi&s;u&s;e your rea&s;on: And this is a con&s;ideration that &s;hou'd put you upon a due care, that you may u&s;e it well; but no argument why you &s;hou'd not u&s;e it at all: And indeed, if you &s;hou'd throw by your rea&s;on as a u&s;ele&s;s thing, you would at once put your &s;elves in the way of all manner of de|lu&s;ion.</P>
<P>But, it may be, you will &s;ay, you have committed your&s;elves to the <HI>guidance</HI> of the SPIRIT; which is the be&s;t pre&s;ervative. Herein you have done well; no|thing can be objected again&s;t this method of conduct: Only take heed of mi&s;takes, touching the SPIRIT's <HI>guidance.</HI> Let me enquire of you, how is it the SPIRIT pre&s;erves from delu&s;ion? Is it not by opening the under&s;tanding, and enabling the man, in the due u&s;e of his rea&s;on, to perceive the truth of the things of GOD and religion? Mo&s;t certainly: And, if you think of being led by the SPIRIT without under&s;tanding, or in oppo&s;ition to it, you deceive your&s;elves. The SPIRIT of GOD deals with men as <HI>rea&s;onable</HI> creatures: And
<PB N="20" REF="004912_0030_100E1947F2732558">
they ought to deal with them&s;elves in like manner And while they do thus, making is wi&s;e and good u&s;e of the under&s;tanding, GOD has given them, they will take a proper means to prevent their falling into de|lu&s;ions; nor will there be much danger of their being led a&s;ide by <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;tic</HI> heat and imagination.</P>
<P N="4">4. You mu&s;t not lay too great &s;tre&s;s upon the <HI>work|ings</HI> of your <HI>pa&s;&s;ions</HI> and <HI>affections.</HI> The&s;e will be exci|ted, in a le&s;s or greater degree, in the bu&s;ine&s;s of religion: And 'tis proper they &s;hou'd. The pa&s;&s;ions, when &s;uitably mov'd, tend mightily to awaken the <HI>rea&s;onable powers,</HI> and put them upon a lively and vi|gorous exerci&s;e. And this is their proper u&s;e: And when addre&s;s'd to, and excited to this purpo&s;e, they may be of good &s;ervice: whereas we &s;hall mi&s;take the right u&s;e of the pa&s;&s;ions, if we place our religion <HI>only</HI> or <HI>chiefly,</HI> in the heat and fervour of them. The <HI>&s;oul</HI> is the <HI>man</HI>: And unle&s;s the <HI>rea&s;onable nature</HI> is &s;uitably wro't upon, the <HI>under&s;tanding</HI> enlightned, the <HI>judgment</HI> convinc'd, the <HI>will</HI> per&s;waded, and the <HI>mind</HI> intirely chang'd, it will avail but to little purpo&s;e; tho' the pa&s;|&s;ions &s;hou'd be &s;et all in a blaze. This therefore you &s;hou'd be mo&s;t concern'd about. And if while you are &s;ollicitous that you may be in tran&s;ports of affecti|on, you neglect your more noble part, your rea&s;on and judgment, you will be in great danger of being carried away by your imaginations. This indeed leads directly to <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m</HI>: And you will in vain, endeavour to pre|&s;erve your&s;elves from the influence of it, if you a'nt duly careful to keep your pa&s;&s;ions in their proper place, under the government of a well inform'd under&s;tanding. While the pa&s;&s;ions are uppermo&s;t, and bear the chief &s;way over a man, he is in an un&s;afe &s;tate: None knows what he may be bro't to. You can't therefore be too careful to keep your pa&s;&s;ions under the regimen of a <HI>&s;ober judgment.</HI> 'Tis indeed a matter of nece&s;&s;ity, as you would not be led a&s;ide by delu&s;ion and fancy.</P>
<P N="5">5. In the la&s;t place here, you mu&s;t not forget to go to GOD by <HI>prayer.</HI> This is a duty in all ca&s;es, but in none more than the pre&s;ent. If left to your|&s;elves, your own wi&s;dom and &s;trength, you will be in|&s;ufficient

You mu&s;t daily commit the keeping of your &s;oul to him; and this you mu&s;t particularly be careful to do in times of more &s;pecial hazard; humbly hoping in GOD to be your help: And if he &s;hall plea&s;e to undertake for you, no delu&s;ion &s;hall ever have power over you, to &s;educe you; but, po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ing a &s;ound mind, you &s;hall go on in the uniform, &s;teady &s;ervice of your maker and generation, till of the mercy of GOD, thro' the merits of the REDEEMER, you are crowned with eternal life.</P>
<P>But I &s;hall now draw towards a clo&s;e, by making &s;ome &s;uitable <HI>application</HI> of what has been &s;aid, And,</P>
<P N="1">1. Let us beware of charging GOD <HI>fooli&s;hly,</HI> from what we have heard of the <HI>nature,</HI> and <HI>influence</HI> of <HI>en|thu&s;ia&s;m.</HI> This may appear a dark article in GOD's government of the world; but it &s;tands upon the &s;ame foot with his permi&s;&s;ion of other evils, whether <HI>natural</HI> or <HI>moral.</HI> And, if we &s;hou'd not be able to &s;ee perfect|ly into the rea&s;on of this di&s;pen&s;ation, we &s;hou'd ra|ther attribute it to our own ignorance, than reply a|gain&s;t GOD. We may a&s;&s;ure our&s;elves, a wi&s;e, and good, and holy GOD, would not have &s;uffered it thus to be, if there were not &s;ome great and valuable ends to be hereby an&s;wered.</P>
<P>Greater advantages may, in the end, accrue to true religion, by the &s;ufferance of an <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;tic</HI> &s;pirit, and the prevalence of it, at certain times, than we may be capable of di&s;cerning at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="004912_0032_100E194AD95F0E60">It may furni&s;h both opportunity and occa&s;ion for the trial of tho&s;e, who call them&s;elves chri&s;tians; whe|ther they have ju&s;t notions of religion, and courage and faithfulne&s;s to &s;tand up for <HI>real</HI> truths, again&s;t meer <HI>imaginary</HI> ones.&mdash;It may &s;erve as a foil to &s;et off the beauty and glory of true, genuine chri&s;tianity.&mdash;It may tend to the encouragement of rea&s;onable and &s;olid re|ligion; and, in the run of things, recommend it, in the mo&s;t effectual manner, to men's choice and practice.&mdash; In a word, It may put men upon a more thorough ex|amination into the grounds of the chri&s;tian religion, and be the means of their being, more generally, e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in its truth, upon the be&s;t and mo&s;t rea&s;onable evidence.</P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;ome of the ends capable of being an&s;wer|ed by the permi&s;&s;ion of a <HI>&s;pirit of enthu&s;ia&s;m,</HI> and the prevalence of it, for a while. And as to the per&s;ons them&s;elves led a&s;ide by it, it is, in the &s;ame way to be reconcil'd with the general goodne&s;s of GOD towards men, as in the ca&s;e of <HI>di&s;traction,</HI> and the evil ef|fects con&s;equent theruepon. The per&s;ons, heated with <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;tic</HI> imaginations, are either, in a faulty &s;en&s;e, acce&s;&s;ary to this unhappy turn of mind, or they are not: If the <HI>latter,</HI> they may depend upon the pity and mercy of GOD, notwith&s;tanding the extravagancies they may run into; yea, if they are good men, as is, doubtle&s;s, &s;ometimes the ca&s;e, it may be hoped, that this evil which has happened to them, will, after the manner of other &s;ufferings, work together for good to them: But if thro' the pride of their hearts, a vain|glorious temper, accompanied with ra&s;hne&s;s and arro|gance, or the like, they are really acce&s;&s;ary to their own delu&s;ion, and mad conduct following therefrom, let them not think to ca&s;t the blame on GOD: They do but reap the fruit of what they them&s;elves have &s;own. And if they &s;hou'd be totally delivered up, as has &s;ometimes been the ca&s;e, to the devices of their own hearts, and the <HI>lying in&s;pirations</HI> of <HI>wicked &s;pirits,</HI> they can fault no body but them&s;elves. GOD is ju&s;t while he makes them an example for the warning of others, le&s;t they al&s;o be given up to believe lies. And he is <HI>good</HI> as well as ju&s;t; good to others, in put|ting them hereby upon their guard, tho' he is &s;evere towards <HI>them.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="23" REF="004912_0033_100E1978E87ACB00">2. Let none, from what has been offered, entertain prejudices in their minds again&s;t the <HI>operations</HI> of the SPIRIT. There is &s;uch a thing as his influence upon the hearts of men. No con&s;i&s;tent &s;en&s;e can be put upon a great part of the <HI>bible,</HI> unle&s;s this be acknow|ledged for a truth: Nor is it any objection again&s;t its being &s;o, that there has been a great deal of <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;m</HI> in the world, many who have mi&s;taken the motions of their own pa&s;&s;ions for divine operations. This, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, &s;hou'd make us cautious; put|ting us upon a careful examination of whatever offers it&s;elf, as a communication from the SPIRIT, that we deceive not our&s;elves: But its no argument, why we &s;hou'd conceive a &s;lighty tho't, either of the SPIRIT, or his influences, really made upon the minds of men. Much le&s;s is it a ju&s;t ground of exception again&s;t the SPIRIT's <HI>operations,</HI> that they may be counterfeited; that men may make an appearance, as if they were acted by the SPIRIT, when, all the while, they have no o|ther view in their pretences, but to &s;erve them&s;elves. This has often been the ca&s;e; and points it out as a matter of nece&s;&s;ity, that we take heed to our&s;elves, if we would not be impos'd upon by a <HI>fair &s;hew,</HI> and <HI>good words:</HI> But at the &s;ame time, 'tis no rea&s;on, why we &s;hou'd think the wor&s;e of the ble&s;&s;ed SPIRIT, or of tho&s;e influences that are really <HI>his.</HI></P>
<P>Let us be upon our guard as to this matter. Many, from what they have &s;een or heard of the &s;trange con|duct of men, pretending to be under <HI>divine impre&s;&s;ions,</HI> have had their minds in&s;en&s;ibly leaven'd with prejudices again&s;t the things of the SPIRIT. O let it be our care, that we be not thus wro't upon! And the rather, lea&s;t it &s;hou'd prove the ruin of our &s;ouls. This, perhaps, we may not be afraid of: But the danger is great, if we take up wrong notions of the SPIRIT, or encourage an unbecomming tho't of his influences in the bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;alvation, lea&s;t we &s;hou'd grieve the <HI>good</HI> SPI|RIT, and he &s;hou'd leave us to peri&s;h in a &s;tate of a|lianation from GOD, and true holine&s;s.</P>
<P>'Tis worthy our particular remark, it is by the pow|erful operation of the holy SPIRIT on the hearts of
<PB N="24" REF="004912_0034_100E194D659FE5A0">
men, that they are chang'd from the love and prac|tice of &s;in, to the love and practice of holine&s;s; and have tho&s;e tempers form'd in them, whereby they are made meet for the glory to be hereafter revealed: Nor can this be done, in any way, without the <HI>&s;pe|cial influence</HI> of the ble&s;&s;ed SPIRIT.</P>
<P>And is it likely, <HI>He</HI> &s;hou'd be pre&s;ent with men to &s;uch gracious purpo&s;es, if they &s;uffer their minds to be impre&s;&s;ed with contemptuous tho'ts of him? If they begin to call in que&s;tion his <HI>office,</HI> as the <HI>great di&s;|pen&s;er of divine grace,</HI> or look upon his operations as all delu&s;ion and imagination.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t have upon our minds a ju&s;t tho't of the good SPIRIT, and of his <HI>influences.</HI> This is a matter of nece&s;&s;ity. O let us encourage a &s;teady faith in him, as that glorious per&s;on, by whom, and by whom a|lone, we can be prepared in this world, for happine&s;s in the world that is come. And let nothing, no wild|ne&s;s of enthu&s;ia&s;m, ever be al&s;o to tempt us to call this in que&s;tion. And let us &s;o believe in the HOLY GHOST, as to put our&s;elves under his guidance; and let our dependance be on him for grace to help us in every time of need.</P>
<P>Only let us look to it, that we take no <HI>impre&s;&s;ions</HI> for his but &s;uch as really are &s;o: And let us not be &s;atisfied, 'till we experience within our&s;elves the <HI>real effects</HI> of the SPIRIT's operations; &s;uch as are com|mon to all that are in CHRIST JESUS; and always have been, and always will be, accompanied with a <HI>holy frame of &s;oul,</HI> and a <HI>conver&s;ation becoming the Go&s;|pel.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Let not any think <HI>ill</HI> of religion, becau&s;e of the <HI>ill</HI> repre&s;entation that is made of it by <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;ts.</HI> There may be danger of this; e&s;pecially, in regard of tho&s;e who have not upon their minds a &s;erious &s;en&s;e of GOD and the things of another world. They may be ready to judge of religion from the <HI>copy</HI> gi|ven them of it, by tho&s;e who are too much led by their fancies; and to condemn it, in the gro&s;s, as a
<PB N="25" REF="004912_0035_100E197A8268D628">
wild, imaginary, incon&s;i&s;tent thing. But this is to judge too ha&s;tily and ra&s;hly. Religion ought not to &s;uffer in the opinion of any, becau&s;e of the imprudencies or extra|vagancies of tho&s;e, who call them&s;elves the friends of it. Any thing may be abu&s;ed: Nor is there any thing but has actually been abu&s;ed. And why &s;hou'd any think the wor&s;e of religion, becau&s;e &s;ome who make more than ordinary pretences to it, &s;et it forth in an ugly light by their conduct relative to it?</P>
<P>There is &s;uch a thing as real religion, let the conduct of men be what it will; and 'tis, in it's nature, a &s;ober, calm, rea&s;onable thing: Nor is it an objection of any weight again&s;t the &s;obriety or rea&s;onablene&s;s of it, that there have been <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;ts,</HI> who have acted as tho' it was a wild, imaginary bu&s;ine&s;s. We &s;hould not make our e&s;timate of religion as exhibited in the behaviour of men of a <HI>fanciful</HI> mind; to be &s;ure, we &s;hould not take up an ill opinion of it, becau&s;e in the example they give of it, it don't appear &s;o amiable as we might expect. This is unfair. We &s;hou'd rather judge of it from the conduct of men of a <HI>&s;ound judgment</HI>; who&s;e lives have been &s;uch a uniform, beautiful tran&s;cript of that which is ju&s;t and good, that we can't but think well of religion, as di&s;play'd in their example.</P>
<P>But however religion may appear as viewed in the lives, even of the be&s;t men, 'tis a lovely thing, as requir|ed by GOD, and pourtrayed in the bible. We &s;hou'd take our &s;entiments of it from this <HI>book of</HI> GOD; and this, in the calm and &s;ober exerci&s;e of our under&s;tandings: And if we view it, as 'tis here delineated, we can't but ap|prove of it, the <HI>doctrines</HI> it teaches, and the <HI>duties</HI> it re|quires, whether they relate to GOD, our &s;elves, or our neighbour; they are all &s;o rea&s;onable in them&s;elves, and worthy of the GOD, the &s;tamp of who&s;e authority they bear.</P>
<P>Let us fetch our notions of religion from the &s;cripture: And if men, in their practice, &s;et it in a di&s;advantageous light, let us be upon our guard, that we don't take up prejudices again&s;t it. This will blind our eyes, and may, by degrees, prepare the way to our throwing off all con|cern
<PB N="26" REF="004912_0036_100E194FCAFD33B0">
about religion; yea, we may be bro't to treat e|ven with contempt; than which, nothing can be more dangerous, or put our &s;alvation to a greater ri&s;que.</P>
<P N="4">4. Let us e&s;teem tho&s;e as <HI>friends</HI> to religion, and not <HI>enemies,</HI> who warn us of the danger of <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;m,</HI> and would put us upon our guard, that we be not led a&s;ide by it. As the times are, they run the hazard of being call'd <HI>enemies</HI> to the <HI>holy</HI> SPIRIT, and may expect to be ill-&s;po|ken of by many, and loaded with names of reproach: But they are notwith&s;tanding the be&s;t friends to religion; and it may be, it will more and more appear, that they have all along been &s;o. They have been &s;tigmati&s;ed as OPPOSERS of the WORK OF GOD; but 'tis a great mer|cy of GOD, there have been &s;uch OPPOSERS: This land had, in all probability, been over-run with confu&s;ion and di&s;traction, if they had acted under the influence of the &s;ame <HI>heat</HI> and <HI>zeal,</HI> which &s;ome others have been famous for.</P>
<P>'Tis really be&s;t, people &s;hou'd know there is &s;uch a thing as <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;m,</HI> and that it has been, in all ages, one of the mo&s;t dangerous enemies to the church of GOD, and has done a world of mi&s;chief: And 'tis a kindne&s;s to them to be warn'd again&s;t it, and directed to the proper me|thods to be pre&s;erved from it. 'Tis indeed, one of the be&s;t ways of doing &s;ervice to <HI>real</HI> religion, to di&s;tingui&s;h it from that which is <HI>imaginary</HI>: Nor &s;hou'd mini&s;ters be di&s;couraged from endeavouring this, tho' they &s;hou'd be ill-tho't, or evil-&s;poken of. They &s;hou'd beware of be|ing too much under the influence of that <HI>fear of man, which bringeth a &s;nare</HI>; which is evidently the ca&s;e, where they are either &s;ilent, or dare not &s;peak out faith|fully and plainly, le&s;t they &s;hou'd be called PHARISEES or HYPOCRITES, and charged with LEADING SOULS TO THE DEVIL. 'Tis a <HI>&s;mall matter</HI> to be thus <HI>judged</HI> and <HI>reviled</HI>; and we &s;hou'd be above being affrighted from duty by this, which is nothing more than the <HI>breath</HI> of poor, ignorant, frail man.</P>
<P>There is, I doubt not, a great deal of <HI>real, &s;ub&s;tantial</HI> religion in the land. The SPIRIT of GOD has wro't ef|fectually on the hearts of many, from one time to another:
<PB N="27" REF="004912_0037_100E197DDD91E2A0">
And I make no que&s;tion he has done &s;o of late, in more numerous in&s;tances, it may be, than u&s;ual. But this, notwith&s;tanding, there is, without di&s;pute, a <HI>&s;pirit of en|thu&s;ia&s;m,</HI> appearing in one place and another. There are tho&s;e, who make great pretences to the SPIRIT, who are carried away with their imaginations: And &s;ome, it may be, take them&s;elves to be <HI>immediately and wonder|fully conducted by him</HI>; while they are led only by their own fancies.</P>
<P>Thus it has been in other parts of the world. <HI>Enthu&s;i|a&s;m,</HI> in all the <HI>wildne&s;s,</HI> and <HI>fury,</HI> and <HI>extravagance</HI> of it, has been among them, and &s;ometimes had a mo&s;t dreadfully exten&s;ive &s;pread. <HI>Ten thou&s;and</HI> wild <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;ts</HI> have appear'd in arms, at the &s;ame time; and this too, in defence of <HI>gro&s;s opinions,</HI> as well as <HI>enormous actions.</HI> The fir&s;t di&s;covery therefore of &s;uch a &s;pirit, unle&s;s due care is taken to give check to its growth and progre&s;s, is much to be feared; for there is no knowing, how high it may ri&s;e, nor what it may end in.&mdash;</P>
<P>The good LORD give us all wi&s;dom; and courage, and conduct, in &s;uch a Day as this! And may both <HI>mini&s;ters</HI> and <HI>people</HI> behave after &s;uch a manner, as that religion may not &s;uffer; but in the end, gain advantage, and be &s;till more univer&s;ally e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>And, may that grace of GOD, which has appeared to all men, bringing &s;alvation, teach us effectually, to deny ungodline&s;s and worldly lu&s;ts, and to live &s;oberly, and righteou&s;ly, and godlily in the world: &s;o may we look with comfort for the appearing of our SAVIOUR JESUS CHRIST: And when he &s;hall appear in the glory of his FATHER, and with his holy angels, we al&s;o &s;hall appear with him, and go away into everla&s;ting life: Which GOD, of his infinite mercy grant may be the portion of us all; for the &s;ake of CHRIST JESUS.</P>
