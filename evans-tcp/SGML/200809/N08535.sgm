<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>CANDID READER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WERE it not apprehended by me a duty, thus to offer to thy &s;e|rious peru&s;al the following plain and experimental ob&s;ervations upon various &s;ubjects, thou had&s;t not heard from me in this way.</P>
<P>I have often, with many brethren and &s;i&s;ters in the truth, been deeply affected in viewing the great danger Chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ors are expo&s;ed to through a prevailing indifference of mind. For when a lethargic &s;tupefac|tion hath gained the a&s;cendancy, reli|gion in notion, and fruitle&s;s &s;peculati|on, &s;atisfy a mind &s;o depraved. A re|novation of heart, without which none can be truly religious, hath not been &s;ought after. Plea&s;ed with the &s;hell or form only, &s;uch have not been &s;en|&s;ible they wanted the &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P><PB REF="010917_0003_0F8529CD1A16D540">When the &s;ubtil adver&s;ary finds men in this kind of &s;leep or &s;tupefaction, it is then his opportunity for &s;owing the tares among&s;t the wheat: by &s;uch means the field of the Chri&s;tian church became in proce&s;s of time covered therewith. That which came neare&s;t to my heart, and mo&s;t earne&s;tly en|gaged my attention towards the pre|&s;ent undertaking (not without ardent de&s;ires for the la&s;ting advantage of Chri&s;tians of all denominations) was, that the de&s;cendants of a people, who a little above a century ago were very marvellou&s;ly brought out of, and re|deemed from, all lifele&s;s &s;hadows, and empty forms of religion, to enjoy and be grounded in the ble&s;&s;ed power and life thereof, might be pre&s;erved truly &s;en&s;ible of the way and means where|by our worthy predece&s;&s;ors obtained a firm e&s;tabli&s;hment in the truth, as it is Chri&s;t Je&s;us: for it is evident, where the means are neglected, the end can|not be attained.</P>
<P><PB REF="010917_0004_0F8529CDD5873718">That many of the&s;e de&s;cendants in this day of outward peace and plenty, inclining to fal&s;e liberty and ea&s;e, do &s;hun the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, which would crucify them to the world, is a mourn|ful truth, too obvious to be denied. In con&s;ideration hereof, I found a concern to throw a few ob&s;ervations before them, as near as I could, &s;uited to the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things; endea|vouring, in &s;ome degree, to offer to the view of the pre&s;ent and &s;ucceed|ing generations, by what means our worthy predece&s;&s;ors became &s;uch a living honourable body of people; that the nece&s;&s;ity may fully appear of the &s;ame ble&s;&s;ed power operating upon their minds, in order to qualify all, that they may rightly &s;ucceed tho&s;e valiants in maintaining the cau&s;e of God.</P>
<P>The objection which ca&s;t &s;ome di&s;|couragement in my way, may al&s;o oc|cur to &s;ome readers, viz. that the &s;ub|jects treated of in this &s;mall tract have
<PB REF="010917_0005_0F8529CECFBE0B68">
been divers times heretofore judiciou&s;ly wrote upon by different authors. This is no more than may be &s;aid of mo&s;t other religious &s;ubjects as well as the&s;e. Divine Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s hath &s;een meet to receive the &s;ame truths, by different in&s;truments from genera|tion to generation; the Lord's &s;ervants &s;peaking the &s;ame thing, as with one mouth. Herein God's gracious con|de&s;cen&s;ion to human frailty is very con|&s;picuous and wonderful, by cau&s;ing tho&s;e excellent truths, &s;o e&s;&s;ential to be received that man's &s;oul may be &s;av|ed, to be frequently revived and incul|cated, &s;eeing he is &s;o liable to forget God, and his rea&s;onable duty to him.</P>
<P>Having no de&s;ire to enlarge, I &s;hall only add my earne&s;t prayer to the God and Father of all &s;ure mercies, that this mite of &s;imple experimental truths, which I have ca&s;t into the trea&s;ury, may meet the &s;erious reader, of what|ever denomination, with the divine ble&s;&s;ing in it! If that graciou&s;ly attend,

though what is here offered may be ju&s;tly accounted as the barley-loaves, the hungry &s;oul may receive &s;ome &s;trength and refre&s;hment thereby.</P>

<HEAD>SOME BRIEF REMARKS UPON Sundry Important Subjects.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER I. Containing tender ADVICE, CAUTION and COUNSEL tO PARENTS and CHILDREN.</HEAD>
<P>FIRST to parents. Very much depends upon a right education of children. I there|fore find it in my mind to make a few ob&s;ervations thereon, as it &s;hall plea&s;e the Lord to open my under&s;tanding; without who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and ble&s;&s;ing upon our labours, they prove altogether fruitle&s;s.</P>
<P>The children of I&s;rael were &s;trictly enjoined to make the training up their children in the law of God their con&s;tant care; viz.
<Q>Hear, O I&s;rael, the Lord our God is one Lord; and thou &s;halt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy &s;oul, and with all thy might. And the&s;e words which I command thee this day,
<PB N="2" REF="010917_0009_0F8529D34CE452D0">
&s;hall be in thine heart, and thou &s;halt teach them diligently unto thy children, and &s;halt talk of them when thou &s;itte&s;t in thine hou&s;e, and when thou walke&s;t by the way, and when thou lie&s;t down, and when thou ri&s;e&s;t up.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Deut. vi. 4, 5, 6, 7.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>Exceeding great is the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in parents and heads of families. It certainly lies upon them an indi&s;pen&s;able duty, as much as they can, both by precept and example, to form the tender minds of their offspring to virtue, as &s;aith the apo&s;tle,
<Q>And ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eph. vi. 4.</NOTE></Q>
And,
<Q>Train up a child in the way he &s;hould go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxii. 6.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>Parents mu&s;t fir&s;t be well acquainted with the way of truth, and the nurture and admonition of the Lord them&s;elves, before they can train up their children therein. That which is likely to have the greate&s;t influence upon their tender minds, is a &s;teady circum&s;pect example, in a &s;elf-denying conduct before them; which will beget reverence, and honourable thoughts in children, and &s;ervants too, concerning tho&s;e whom Providence hath placed over them.</P>
<P>Great care &s;hould dwell upon the minds of parents, to make it fully evident to their chil|dren that they are much more de&s;irous they &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s an heavenly than an earthly inheritance; that they are more concerned their &s;ouls may be adorned with the graces of the Holy Spirit, than that their bodies &s;hould appear finely decked with outward ornaments.</P>
<P>Children will be very likely to value that which they &s;ee is preferred by their parents, whether it
<PB N="3" REF="010917_0010_0F8529D42CB54830">
be the things of the world, or religion. If this be really the ca&s;e, which I think will be allowed by con&s;iderate per&s;ons, O then! how much de|pends upon them for the promotion of truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s on the earth, both in regard to the pre&s;ent time, and generations to come. This yet more fully appears by the Lord's te&s;timony con|cerning <HI>Abraham.</HI>
<Q>And the Lord &s;aid, Shall I hide from <HI>Abraham</HI> that thing which I do? &s;eeing that <HI>Abraham</HI> &s;hall &s;urely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth &s;hall be ble&s;&s;ed in him. For I know him, that he will command his children, and his hou&s;hold after him, and they &s;hall keep the way of the Lord, to do ju&s;tice and judgment; that the Lord may bring upon <HI>Abraham</HI> that which he hath &s;poken of him.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. xviii. 17, 18, 19.</NOTE></Q>
In chap. xvii. ver. 18. his godly concern appears earne&s;t, even for the child of the bond-woman; <HI>viz.</HI>
<Q>And <HI>Abraham</HI> &s;aid unto God, Oh! that <HI>I&s;hmael</HI> might live be|fore thee.</Q>
Which petition was an&s;wered.</P>
<P>Con&s;tant and warm endeavours, with &s;ecret cries to God that his ble&s;&s;ing may attend them, may prove effectual to the pre&s;ervation of children. This &s;hould begin very early, even as &s;oon as they are capable to di&s;tingui&s;h what plea&s;es, or what di&s;plea&s;es their parents. A &s;elf-willed perver&s;e di&s;|po&s;ition may &s;oon be di&s;covered in children (more e&s;pecially in &s;ome) which is very earne&s;t to have its own way, before they can judge what is be&s;t for them&s;elves. This &s;hould con&s;tantly be &s;ubjected to tho&s;e that are to judge for them. They &s;hould never be &s;uffered to prevail by an untoward fretful temper, not even when what they crave is &s;uitable for them to receive, were they in a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive di&s;|po&s;ition;
<PB N="4" REF="010917_0011_0F8529D495136A90">
that they may clearly &s;ee (which they &s;oon will) it is more to their benefit and comfort to yield an entire &s;ubjection to their providers, and that nothing is to be got by a fretful &s;elf-willed temper. This &s;hould be done by a con&s;tant &s;teady hand, and it will make the work of parents abun|dantly ea&s;ier in the government of their children, and may prove a great ea&s;e to tho&s;e concerned with them, perhaps through the whole cour&s;e of their lives; &s;ince by cru&s;hing their perver&s;ene&s;s in the fir&s;t buddings, it may &s;o die away, as never more to gain the pre-eminence. This would be a won|derful ble&s;&s;ing, and they would owe their watchful parents more for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing that, and other per|nicious buds in them, than for a large patrimony or outward inheritance. Indeed every thing of an evil nature &s;hould be kept down in them by &s;uch careful ready means. Oh! what a fine hopeful generation of youths &s;hould we have, were parents in general to exerci&s;e this prudent care in all things! I verily believe, in&s;tead of &s;ober virtuous youth be|ing as &s;peckled birds among&s;t others, the rebellious, di&s;obedient, and froward would be &s;o; and this would bring judgment over them.</P>
<P>A con&s;cientious di&s;charge of this great duty would bring an ample reward to &s;uch parents, as have no greater joy than to &s;ee their children walk|ing in the truth: and if they &s;hould prove un&s;uc|ce&s;sful, as it &s;ometimes hath happened, they will be clear of their childrens blood in God's &s;ight, which is a very great thing; &s;o that though the rebellion and evil conduct of their offspring may be their &s;orrow, it will not be their &s;in.</P>
<P>I have &s;ometimes been much grieved, when I have &s;een youth in the way of being ruined by the very imprudent indulgence of their parents,
<PB N="5" REF="010917_0012_0F8529D6079D43B8">
e&s;pecially mothers; making them&s;elves and others mere &s;laves to the perver&s;e humours of their chil|dren; taking abundance of pains to extingui&s;h the flame of their untoward tempers, by &s;uch means as add fewel to the fire; inverting the order of nature, by becoming &s;ubject to tho&s;e who &s;hould &s;ubmit to them, by an&s;wering their unrea&s;onable <HI>cravings;</HI> making them&s;elves more work (and that too of a very di&s;agreeable nature) to educate one, than, were they to follow the method before hinted, it would require to educate a number, and in the end not &s;o well done neither. Parents, who are &s;o very imprudent, have le&s;s rea&s;on to reflect upon their children for being &s;elf-willed, and not &s;ubject to them when they grow up: &s;eeing they them|&s;elves have cheri&s;hed, fed, and &s;upported that tem|per in them from their cradles; whereby, unle&s;s religion lays deep hold of them, and changes the &s;tate of their minds, they are unfitted to be a comfort either to them&s;elves or others; not being formed for good &s;ervants, hu&s;bands, wives, or members of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Alas! when I take a view of the world, and re|flect how it wallows in abundance of wickedne&s;s and corruption, which mankind po&s;&s;e&s;s in a kind of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion from parents to children, like out|ward inheritances; I have no words &s;ufficient to &s;et forth to the full &s;o deplorable a ca&s;e. How &s;orrowful it is to ob&s;erve even children, by the power of example, become as grown men in wick|edne&s;s and hardne&s;s of heart! Cu&s;tom and general practice hath, as it were, changed the nature of &s;ome gro&s;s evils, &s;o that there appears very little remor&s;e in the almo&s;t con&s;tant practice of them. Many children are brought up, like their parents, much &s;trangers to their duty both to God and
<PB N="6" REF="010917_0013_0F8529D61FCEF990">
man. This almo&s;t univer&s;al infection of evil, for|getfulne&s;s of God, and of many or mo&s;t relative duties, by a con&s;tantly wallowing in the pollutions of this world, are very alarming, and call loudly for a reformation, le&s;t the Lord break forth in judgment upon the nations, as the breach of wa|ters. It is indeed a painful ta&s;k for godly parents, amid&s;t &s;o general a depravity, to educate their children without receiving &s;ome tincture from this pollution, which runs down like a &s;trong torrent. The &s;afe&s;t way is, with great &s;trictne&s;s to keep them out of &s;uch company; though an inconve|niency may attend that in &s;ome outward re&s;pects, But oh! the &s;ouls are the mo&s;t precious part of them, which parents, above all other con&s;idera|tions, ought to be concerned to pre&s;erve untainted with the defilements of this world.</P>
<P>There is no better rule to proceed and act by in this important ta&s;k, than the Spirit of truth, pro|mi&s;ed to lead us into all truth. If we mind this, we &s;hall not indulge our children in any individual thing which that te&s;tifies again&s;t in our&s;elves. We &s;hall be far from pleading, that becau&s;e they are young, &s;ome greater liberties may be allowed them in dre&s;s or otherwi&s;e; but as they are a part of our|&s;elves, the &s;ame divine law &s;hould be a &s;tanding rule for the whole.</P>
<P>I have taken notice, that divers parents, who, as to their outward appearance, &s;eem to have learned, in degree, the le&s;&s;on of humility and &s;elf-denial, however as far as could be di&s;covered by their dre&s;s and addre&s;s, yet &s;eem to have no aver|&s;ion to their children's making a different appear|ance; nay, &s;ome will even introduce them into it them&s;elves whil&s;t very young; by which it is plain
<PB N="7" REF="010917_0014_0F8529D6D87DAB28">
they have a pride in &s;eeing them &s;o, and cannot help (notwith&s;tanding their outward &s;hew) di&s;co|vering great un&s;oundne&s;s, and that they them&s;elves are not what they would pa&s;s for. I &s;incerely wi&s;h that parents, who are apt to indulge wrong liber|ties in their children, by &s;uffering them to deviate from that pure &s;implicity and &s;elf-denial Truth led our ance&s;tors, and &s;till leads tho&s;e who follow it into, would con&s;ider, in the fir&s;t place, the injury their children &s;u&s;tain thereby, by being placed in a difficult and dangerous &s;ituation with re&s;pect to temptations, which may be pre&s;ented to them by the children of the land, or of the world: for doubtle&s;s the more like them they appear, the more free and intimate will &s;uch make them&s;elves with them, that they may be drawn out into undue liberties; whereas, did they make an appearance quite con&s;i&s;tent with their plain &s;elf-denying pro|fe&s;&s;ion, that &s;ort would be more backward to at|tempt an acce&s;s to them.</P>
<P>There is no doubt with me, but this has opened a way for many under our profe&s;&s;ion to ruin them|&s;elves, by going out in marriage; and their parents have been, by their imprudent indulgence, the original cau&s;e thereof. For &s;uffering them to be &s;o much like the world, and &s;o little like what Truth leads into, they are put out of the way of the be&s;t connexions in marriage among&s;t us, <HI>viz.</HI> the mo&s;t religious; as &s;uch dare not &s;eek to, nor join with, tho&s;e who give way to undue liberties: I mean &s;uch as Truth doth not allow us, as people who ought in all things to hold up a true &s;tandard to the nations, to continue in. Here incon&s;iderate tender youth, through their aptne&s;s to crave the glittering gaiety of the world, and their much more imprudent parents indulging them therein,
<PB N="8" REF="010917_0015_0F8529DB528B67F0">
are, as it were, prepared for ruin, unle&s;s divine mercy interpo&s;e; and are al&s;o removed out of the way of the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing that can be enjoyed in the things of this life; <HI>viz.</HI> a truly religious hu&s;|band or wife.</P>
<P>Some parents have been pierced through with much &s;orrow by &s;uch means, and have had great cau&s;e to repent when it was too late, and there hath been rea&s;on to fear that the blood of their children would be required at their hands. Oh! how di&s;|honourably have &s;ome leaned to un&s;uitable con|nexions for their children, when there hath been a large outward pro&s;pect! It is to be feared divers parents have looked at little el&s;e. This hath &s;ome|times appeared to have been the ca&s;e, by the &s;light put upon the offers of tho&s;e, who have wanted nothing to recommend them but wealth; the want of which, in the eye of &s;uch, has proved &s;o of|fen&s;ive, that they &s;eem to have been rejected on that account. This is very wrong, and ought ne|ver to have entrance among&s;t any profe&s;&s;ing the Chri&s;tian name;
<Q>For the earth is the Lord's, and the fulne&s;s thereof.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e hints are not intended to encourage any to a&s;pire after great things; but that all &s;hould, with a &s;ingle eye, ear|ne&s;tly &s;eek for divine coun&s;el, both in making and accepting offers for marriage.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>Some perhaps may think I am very clo&s;e and &s;evere upon parents; that it is not always their fault when children take undue liberties; (which I have already granted) that they are frequently very &s;elf-willed and ungovernable. This is indeed &s;aying &s;omething, when children become their own rulers by age, or otherwi&s;e, and have to cloath and pro|vide for them&s;elves; but I think it has little weight whil&s;t their parents provide for them, who have
<PB N="9" REF="010917_0016_0F8529DC0A8E50F8">
not only power to advi&s;e and per&s;uade, but al&s;o to command and re&s;train. They certainly may and ought to be ab&s;olute, in ca&s;es where the te&s;ti|mony of truth is in danger of &s;uffering.</P>
<P>It is very ob&s;ervable, that <HI>Eli</HI> was greatly blamed, becau&s;e he, having power, did not re&s;train his wicked &s;ons; though it plainly appears he much di&s;approved of their practices, and expo&s;tulated with them on that account, and laid before them the pernicious con&s;equences of their evil conduct. Oh! how very affecting it is, to con&s;ider the fearful calamities which came upon that hou&s;e; and al&s;o upon <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> probably in &s;ome mea&s;ure on the &s;ame account.</P>
<P>The neglect and imprudent indulgence of pa|rents in the training up their children, is al&s;o a painful lo&s;s to the &s;ociety, as the con&s;equence thereof tends greatly to ob&s;truct the progre&s;s of truth, by &s;tanding in the way of &s;erious enquirers as &s;tumbling-blocks; when it is &s;een by &s;uch, that the &s;ame undue liberties they are called out of, are indulged among&s;t us, they are offended. Oh! that parents, children, and all who are unfaithful, and who ea&s;ily &s;uffer the important branches of our Chri&s;tian te&s;timony to fall (as indeed they would all appear, if they were &s;een in a true light) would deeply con&s;ider the mournful con&s;equence thereof, by retarding the progre&s;s of truth, and grievou&s;ly eclip&s;ing the beauty of <HI>Sion!</HI> Then I greatly hope a more lively zeal and holy ardour would prevail, and that the carele&s;s &s;ons and daughters thereof would ari&s;e, and &s;hake them|&s;elves from the du&s;t of the earth, putting on the beautiful garment of holine&s;s and truth, that &s;he might become more and more a prai&s;e in the earth.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="010917_0017_0F8529DC2C9A7CD0">Having offered a few remarks concerning the important duty of parents, it now remains to do the &s;ame re&s;pecting the indi&s;pen&s;ible duty of chil|dren to <HI>honour and obey their parents in the Lord,</HI> which is &s;trongly enjoined in the holy &s;criptures, and, in the nature of things, of la&s;ting and in|di&s;pen&s;ible obligation.</P>
<P>The command is,
<Q>Honour thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long upon the Land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Exod. xx. 12.</NOTE></Q>
Read <HI>Matt.</HI> xv. 4. <HI>Mark</HI> vii. 10. <HI>Luke</HI> xviii. 20. <HI>Eph.</HI> vi. 2.3. In that which is con&s;i&s;tent with the law of God, no children can &s;tand acquitted before the &s;upreme Judge, for di&s;obeying or di&s;|honouring their parents. This Obedience and honour not only extend to the yielding to what they enjoin or direct, but al&s;o to the pre&s;ervation of a reverent awe, and honourable e&s;teem in the heart, ari&s;ing from a bottom of love, which would on all ju&s;t occa&s;ions cheri&s;h and protect them. It is a &s;in of a deep dye to di&s;regard and &s;light pa|rents, as appears by <HI>Deut.</HI> xxvii. 16.

<P>On the other hand, very memorable was the kind and watchful Providence which attended &s;uch as feared the Lord, and tho&s;e who loved,
<PB N="11" REF="010917_0018_0F8529DDAA4BD9B0">
honoured, and obeyed their parents; as <HI>Jacob, Jo&s;eph, Ruth, Samuel,</HI> and <HI>David;</HI> al&s;o the <HI>Re|chabites.</HI> Read the account concerning them, <HI>Jer.</HI> xxxv. Re&s;pecting &s;uch as lived in the fear of the Lord, let me recommend the ca&s;e of <HI>Daniel,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dan. iii.</NOTE> and the three children, who, becau&s;e of their faith|fulne&s;s to God, were pre&s;erved unhurt, when by their adver&s;aries expo&s;ed to the greate&s;t torment and danger.</P>
<P>It would far exceed the bounds of my intention to particularize all tho&s;e excellent patterns and examples we are favoured with the account of, which are wonderfully adapted to in&s;truct, encou|rage, and improve the youth, as well as others. There are al&s;o, for caution and warning, examples and very affecting in&s;tances of fearful judgments and dreadful calamities, which fell upon the rebel|lious and gain&s;ayers. May the tender minds of youth, by reading the&s;e things, (as recorded in the holy &s;criptures and other good books) be deeply impre&s;&s;ed with proper &s;entiments concerning good and evil, and the very different rewards of virtue and vice, both in this world, and in the world to come.</P>
<P>It is a very commendable, as well as a very pro|fitable thing, to be conver&s;ant in tho&s;e &s;acred writ|ings. Remember what <HI>Paul</HI> &s;aid of his beloved &s;on <HI>Timothy, viz.</HI>
<Q>From a child thou ha&s;t known the holy &s;criptures, which are able to make thee wi&s;e unto &s;alvation, through faith which is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us. All &s;cripture given by in&s;piration of God, is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for in&s;truction in righteou&s;ne&s;s; that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furni&s;hed unto all good works.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. iii. 15, 16, 17.</NOTE></Q>
But let the
<PB N="12" REF="010917_0019_0F8529DE5F0C5570">
youth and all duly con&s;ider, that the profiting by the&s;e &s;acred writings entirely depends upon the holy living powerful faith of Chri&s;t, which worketh by love, purifying the heart; and whereby we come to &s;ee him who is invi&s;ible, and con&s;equently to under&s;tand the precious my&s;teries of his king|dom, as far as is proper and nece&s;&s;ary for us to know them, which is all that is lawful for us to de&s;ire. There are many other good and profitable books, but none in which is contained &s;uch a &s;tore of rich trea&s;ure, and &s;ublime heavenly my&s;teries, wonderfully wrapped up, and entirely concealed from earthly wi&s;dom and carnal policy. For none can know the things of God without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Spirit, as appears by 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> ii. 10. to 15. and in many other places too tedious to enu|merate.</P>
<P>Great hath been the concern of the church in its large&s;t collective body; as appears by frequent and very pre&s;&s;ing affectionate advice, caution, and coun&s;el to the youth, to read the holy &s;criptures, and other profitable books, carefully to refrain from all &s;uch which may have the lea&s;t tendency to alienate their minds from the holy fear of God, and a &s;ober virtuous cour&s;e of life, or which are barely for amu&s;ement, being unprofitable; whereas time is very precious, &s;hort, and uncertain; there|fore it &s;hould be carefully improved to the &s;oul's everla&s;ting advantage. Moreover, that the youth do yield &s;trict and careful obedience to the Divine Monitor within, to parents, and all tho&s;e who have the rule over them without, carefully to &s;hun the vain unprofitable amu&s;ements, as well as the cor|rupt conver&s;ation of the world: earne&s;tly admo|ni&s;hing all, to avoid every thing in their dre&s;s and addre&s;s, which might have the lea&s;t tendency to

render them &s;uitable for an intercour&s;e, league, or amity with the children of the land; or of a de|praved degenerate world, that wallows in pollution and great defilements, le&s;t they &s;hould be drawn a&s;ide, as <HI>Dinah</HI> was, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. xxxiv. 1.</NOTE> by going out to &s;ee the daugh|ters of the land; and as the children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> were, by their woeful intimacy with the daughters of <HI>Moab</HI> and <HI>Midian.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Numb. xxv.</NOTE> Read the whole chapter; not forgetting the dreadful fall of <HI>Solomon,</HI> the wi&s;e&s;t king, who, by contracting intimacy with tho&s;e that were &s;trangers to God, and his holy covenant, came to have his heart drawn away from the living and true God, who had appeared to him in <HI>Gibeon;</HI> and &s;o greatly deba&s;ed him&s;elf, as to bow down to their paltry dumb idols. Time would fail to re|capitulate one half of the mournful in&s;tances re|corded in the holy &s;criptures, and other authentick accounts, concerning the hurtful con&s;equences of God's people mixing and joining with the nations.

<P>Our youth have been al&s;o highly favoured with a living powerful mini&s;try, which hath often reached the <HI>Witne&s;s of God in their hearts.</HI> What a won|derful favour is this! when we con&s;ider that the greate&s;t part of <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> almo&s;t ever &s;ince the apo&s;tles days, have deprived them&s;elves thereof, by &s;ub&s;tituting human wi&s;dom and learning in its place; &s;o that the panting thir&s;ty &s;oul could meet with little from their mini&s;ters, but the muddy nau&s;eous waters of <HI>Babylon</HI> to drink; neither could they direct to the pa&s;tures of Chri&s;t's flock; but coun&s;el was darkened by a multitude of words without knowledge, and the commandments of God made void by the precepts, inventions, and injunctions of men. What a ble&s;&s;ed time is your
<PB N="14" REF="010917_0021_0F8529E02250CE28">
lot ca&s;t in, even when evangelical Light and Truth hath di&s;covered it&s;elf in perfect purity! Oh! that our youth would con&s;ider and deeply ponder in their hearts, that notwith&s;tanding the great and earne&s;t labours many ways be&s;towed in godly love and zeal for the whole &s;ociety's pre&s;ervation in the way of truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s, yet very &s;orrowful and obvious hath been the declen&s;ion in practice of many among&s;t us. A mournful inundation of undue liberties has flowed in; many have made grievous advances in tho&s;e corrupt peri&s;hing plea|&s;ures, and trifling amu&s;ements, which our truly pious predece&s;&s;ors wholly denied, and turned their backs upon, and have left us large and lively te&s;ti|monies, by way of warning and caution, carefully to avoid being entangled with &s;uch yokes of bon|dage. All the&s;e things have prevailed for want of abiding in the fear of God, and duly con&s;idering that he is ever pre&s;ent, beholding all our words and actions, be they ever &s;o much concealed from the view of mortals; yet he knows them alto|gether. When the mind is &s;uffered to turn to his pure Witne&s;s in the heart, we find reproof, cor|rection, and judgment, for giving way to wrong things: and as the youth abide in &s;ubjection there|unto, they will be afraid to tran&s;gre&s;s its pure law in the mind; which they will find agree exactly with the precepts and injunctions recorded in holy writ, re&s;pecting their duty to God, to their pa|rents, and all mankind.</P>
<P>The rea&s;on why many, who &s;ee their duty, fail in the performance, is their departing from the perfect law of liberty, and of the Spirit of life in their minds. They may be informed concern|ing their duty by outward means and law: but the ability is only to be &s;ound ari&s;ing from the in|ward law, agreeable to <HI>Rom.</HI> viii. 3.
<Q>For the
<PB N="15" REF="010917_0022_0F8529E0C4C89FE8">
law of the Spirit of life in Chri&s;t Je&s;us hath made me free from the law of &s;in and death.</Q>
In obedience and humble &s;ubjection to this holy law, youth would enjoy that pure peace, heavenly &s;erenity, and &s;weet con&s;olation of &s;oul, which in|finitely &s;urpa&s;&s;eth all the trea&s;ures and plea&s;ures of the earth; and would have a well-grounded hope of a happy eternity. It is the adver&s;ary that leads to that obduracy and &s;elf-willed rebellious &s;tate of mind, to be ob&s;erved in &s;ome of the youth, who, by their uncontroulable di&s;po&s;itions, admini&s;ter great &s;orrow and anxiety to their parents and friends, being puffed up with vain conceits in their unex|perienced minds, that they are more capable of judging for them&s;elves, than tho&s;e of greater ex|perience are for them; by rea&s;on whereof too many, it is to be feared, have ru&s;hed on to the ruin of body and &s;oul.</P>
<P>Very great is the danger when the young and unexperienced are proud and opinionated. This naturally rai&s;es above in&s;truction, putting them out of the way of being truly profitable, either to them&s;elves or others. Such, unle&s;s their hearts are mercifully turned by a &s;upernatural power, are never likely to be fit for governing families, or to act as members in the church of God. Seeing, unle&s;s their unmortified wills and tempers are &s;ub|mitted to (however unrea&s;onable) they will break the peace of &s;ociety, and violate the whole&s;ome or|der thereof, being like the un&s;ubjected bulls of <HI>Ba&s;han.</HI></P>
<P>When any a&s;&s;ume the outward form of religion, and take upon them to be active members, with|out a change of heart, they prove a painful burthen to living members; neither can &s;uch make &s;uitable help-mates as hu&s;bands or wives; nor can they in

that &s;tate rightly fill up the honourable &s;tations of parents, ma&s;ters and mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, friends, neighbours, or trade&s;men. I do therefore, in much affection, and de&s;ire for the welfare of tender youth, caution and warn them carefully to avoid the company and conver&s;ation of &s;uch, though under the &s;ame profe&s;&s;ion; who di&s;regard their parents, and tho&s;e who have the rule over them; who &s;light or &s;peak contemptuou&s;ly of their betters, &s;uch as mini&s;ters and elders, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or of the Chri&s;tian advice fre|quently given forth by the yearly and other meet|ings, or of the whole&s;ome di&s;cipline e&s;tabli&s;hed among&s;t us as a people in the wi&s;dom of truth: do not join &s;uch in marriage, however great the outward pro&s;pect may appear; for tender religious minds cannot be happy with &s;uch in that con|nection. And as the fear of the Lord is the be|ginning of wi&s;dom, and that which makes and keeps the heart clean, learn it in tender age; by it you will be taught to remember your Creator in the days of your youth, and, agreeable to the injunction of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, to &s;eek fir&s;t the kingdom of God, and his righteou&s;ne&s;s, and all things nece&s;&s;ary here will be added. Divine wi&s;|dom, as it is regarded, will direct your &s;teps in the cour&s;e of this &s;hort pilgrimage, in the choice of proper help-mates, and all other affairs of con|&s;equence. The &s;ame watchful Providence will be over you in care, guidance, and protection, if you look to it, which attended tho&s;e who lived in his fear, as you may read in the holy &s;criptures.</P>
<P>It greatly behoves you to look diligently to the foot-&s;teps of Chri&s;t's companions, who walked with him through many tribulations, having wa&s;hed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. Be truly contented with that low,
<PB N="17" REF="010917_0024_0F8529E2277C5278">
humble, &s;elf-denying way which you &s;ee they walked in; you can never mend it. If you &s;eek more liberty than that allows of, it will only bring upon you darkne&s;s, pain, and vexation of &s;pirit. Take notice of friends writings in early times, and for a con&s;iderable number of years, how won|derfully the power and love of God was with them and how marvellou&s;ly they were protected amid&s;t the raging foaming waves of earthly powers, com|bined, to lay wa&s;te the heritage. What encou|raging and excellent accounts had they to leave upon record for us, concerning the mighty powerful over&s;hadowing of the canopy of heavenly love and life in their religious a&s;&s;emblies, and of the glory of God &s;hining forth among&s;t them! This, through the mercy of God, is not departed; though there have been &s;ome removes thereof.</P>
<P>Dearly beloved youth: Lay to heart, the great &s;lackne&s;s of zeal which appears in too many; the dimne&s;s, flatne&s;s, and the painful gloomine&s;s, which &s;preads it&s;elf over our a&s;&s;emblies in this our day, hard to break through, many times depriving us of the heavenly places in Chri&s;t Je&s;us our Lord! It is not of Him we are in this condition, but it certainly is our own fault, becau&s;e wrong things are &s;uffered to prevail. Oh! that our youth may be &s;tirred up in a godly zeal to cry out fervently with the prophet <HI>Eli&s;ha,</HI>
<Q>Where is the Lord God of <HI>Elijah?</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Kings ii. 14.</NOTE></Q>

May it be very precious in your eyes from gene|ration to generation, until time &s;hall be no more! Tho&s;e who otherwi&s;e e&s;teem it, turning their backs thereupon, violating the ble&s;&s;ed te&s;timony thereof in its &s;everal branches, will (unle&s;s they repent) be wholly rejected and ca&s;t off, as being unworthy of &s;o great an honour, as that of holding forth a &s;tandard of truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s to the nations; and others will be called and cho&s;en for that great and glorious work: yea, the Lord is able to rai&s;e up of tho&s;e who may be compared to the &s;tones, and to make them <HI>Abraham</HI>'s children, by doing his works; while tho&s;e, who might have been the children of the kingdom, may by di&s;obedience pro|voke him to exclude them.</P>

That which alone can lay a &s;ure foundation for happine&s;s, both in time and eternity, is hardly thought of by many with de&s;ire, or even with any degree of &s;eriou&s;|ne&s;s; unle&s;s it be to &s;hun and evade the force of that power, which thereby would &s;eparate them from their beloved lu&s;ts and fle&s;hly gratifications. In order to effect this, many and exceedingly ab|&s;urd have been the conjectures and dreams of a great part of mankind; but all to &s;hun the cro&s;s; that corrupt &s;elf, with all its &s;eeming rich trea&s;ure and adorning, might be &s;aved. This &s;elf, in many, has been more fond of a religious kind of orna|ment and trea&s;ure, than tho&s;e of any other &s;ort; towards whom the &s;ubtile transformer hath not been wanting plentifully to furni&s;h all tho&s;e minds who have a religious turn. Antichri&s;t, as an emi|nent

<P>But &s;ome are apt to doubt whether &s;uch a thing as an infallible evidence of our adoption is attain|able here; though &s;o fully a&s;&s;erted in the holy &s;crip|tures. This is not to be wondered at, with re&s;pect to tho&s;e who are in the natural, unrenewed &s;tate; &s;eeing the natural man, according to <HI>Paul</HI>'s doc|trine,
<Q>under&s;tandeth not the things of the Spirit of God, neither indeed can he know them, becau&s;e they are &s;piritually di&s;cerned.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. ii. 14.</NOTE></Q>
But I am per&s;uaded none, who have really experienced the new birth, remain doubtful or &s;crupulous con|cerning this important truth. It &s;eems to me altogether unrea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e Infinite Good|ne&s;s, who knows the fallibility and great weak|ne&s;s of his creature man, &s;hould leave any, who&s;e hearts are fully devoted to yield obedience to his will, in a &s;tate liable to mi&s;take the &s;ame, or in any wi&s;e ignorant of his divine approbation, upon a careful di&s;charge of their duty to him. This holy evidence in faithful &s;ouls is indeed the white &s;tone, and in it a new name written, which none know &s;ave tho&s;e who receive it; being an a&s;&s;urance that their names are written in heaven: from whence ari&s;es a joy, which is un&s;peakable and full of glory.</P>
<P>A &s;en&s;e of the wrath of God again&s;t evil, doth often make deep impre&s;&s;ions upon the minds of many; &s;o that they in painful remor&s;e are ready to cry out for mercy and forgivene&s;s of their &s;ins.
<PB N="21" REF="010917_0028_0F8529E52B3036A0">
And &s;eeing this &s;en&s;ibility upon the mind of man, that he hath di&s;plea&s;ed his Creator, neither doth nor can proceed from any thing in man, but the pure witne&s;s of God placed there; &s;o it is quite rea|&s;onable to conclude, that this divine Witne&s;s, upon our faithfully di&s;charging the duty we owe to God, according to its di&s;coveries, will impre&s;s our minds with a &s;weet &s;en&s;e of divine approbation, agreeable to <HI>Rom.</HI> viii. 16.
<Q>The Spirit it&s;elf beareth wit|ne&s;s with our &s;pirit, that we are the children of God.</Q>
With many other pa&s;&s;ages in holy writ of like import.</P>
<P>When any are really di&s;po&s;ed to be religious, great care &s;hould be taken in their fir&s;t &s;etting out. Many have been marred upon the wheel, for want of patience to endure proper tempering; endea|vouring to be formed into ve&s;&s;els, before they have pa&s;&s;ed through the nece&s;&s;ary operation. This has been for want of thoroughly knowing them|&s;elves. For every thing that appertains to the crea|turely will, and forwardne&s;s of de&s;ire to chu&s;e and act for it&s;elf, mu&s;t die upon the cro&s;s, therefore there mu&s;t be a remaining as a chaos without form and void, to endure all &s;orts of &s;torms and tem|pe&s;ts, until the effective Word &s;aith, <HI>Let there be light!</HI> making by his own power a perfect &s;eparation between the light and darkne&s;s in the little world, (<HI>viz.</HI> man) as he did in the great world. Until this is really experienced, man is not in a condition to be placed upon the wheel, to be formed into a ve&s;&s;el of honour. But there mu&s;t be a time for drying, and enduring the furnace.</P>
<P>The&s;e wonderful operations, which I have, in an allegorical way, only ju&s;t touched upon, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily make very deep and la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ions upon all, who have been &s;o happy as &s;o far to
<PB N="22" REF="010917_0029_0F8529E5D96F1008">
experience the nature of that regeneration, with|out which none can &s;ee the kingdom of God. When any are come thus far, there will be no oc|ca&s;ion to make u&s;e of dreams and uncertain con|jectures in forming a judgment concerning their adoption. That divine birth which is rai&s;ed in them, naturally cries, Abba, Father! leaving them no room to doubt, when he is plea&s;ed to appear (which they are taught to wait in the patience for) of their having pa&s;&s;ed from death unto life; or being tran&s;lated from under the power of darkne&s;s into the kingdom of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; which con&s;i&s;teth in righteou&s;ne&s;s, and peace, and joy in the Holy Gho&s;t.</P>
<P>The great danger of man's being deceived lies in the my&s;terious workings of Satan, who has a &s;trong hold in tho&s;e, who, upon their fir&s;t awaken|ing by the call of Chri&s;t, have not &s;uffered his power &s;o far to prevail, as to make them willing to part with all for his &s;ake. There is &s;omething exceedingly reluctant in the &s;trong &s;pirit and will of man, to the falling into nothingne&s;s of &s;elf, and be wholly given up to be guided and upheld by another. This in part ari&s;es from the excel|lency of his frame, and nobility of his under&s;tand|ing, who finds him&s;elf in naturals capable of ef|fecting great things, and knows not, till his eyes are opened and enlightened from above, but that he is equally capable of comprehending what re|lates to him concerning the world to come. In|&s;tead therefore of wholly cea&s;ing from his own will, and relying altogether upon the guidance of the Holy Spirit, he is very apt to be active, and imagines God will be plea&s;ed with his diligence, in the performance of what he apprehends to be religious duties; &s;uch as praying, &s;inging, preach|ing,

<P>Yet &s;ome perhaps, by way of excu&s;e for their not being influenced by the Spirit of Truth in their religion, are ready to call it enthu&s;ia&s;m and pre|&s;umption in tho&s;e who a&s;&s;ert the nece&s;&s;ity thereof, &s;eeming to imagine there is no &s;uch thing in our time to be relied upon; yet they will readily own it was &s;o in the apo&s;tles days.

<P>I have, by experience from my childhood, found two &s;pirits or &s;eeds &s;triving in me for ma&s;tery or rule: I have di&s;covered them to be irreconcileable enemies one to the other; and that I could not &s;erve them both at the &s;ame time. I had an un|der&s;tanding given me, whereby I knew one of tho&s;e &s;eeds was a mea&s;ure of the All-powerful In|exhau&s;tible Source of Goodne&s;s; and the other, which had indeed in a manner leavened the whole lump, was of a wicked and diabolical nature. By means of this corrupt leaven, I had a &s;trong bias to evil of many kinds; neverthele&s;s, I often found the good &s;triking at the evil, as an ax laid to the root thereof, agreeable to <HI>Matth.</HI> iii. 10. in order to de&s;troy that which deprived the Heir of all things of his inheritance. I was long in a kind of &s;u&s;pence, unre&s;olved which to join with; yet &s;aw all depended upon my determination, and that I had full power of choice. On the one hand, when the awakening vi&s;itations of God's Spirit were upon me, it appeared very dreadful to provoke an Omnipotent Being, of unmerited kindne&s;s and mercy, to ca&s;t my &s;oul into ever|la&s;ting perdition. On the other hand, e&s;pecially when tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ed impre&s;&s;ions were &s;omewhat worn off, it was next to death it&s;elf to yield up all my &s;en&s;ual gratifications, and to expo&s;e my&s;elf to the &s;corn and contempt of the world. However, in proce&s;s of time, the Lord in gracious conde&s;cen|&s;ion broke in upon my &s;oul, by his judgments mixed with mercy, in &s;uch a powerful manner, as that I was made willing to yield up thereunto, come life or death. For indeed I looked for

nothing el&s;e at that time, but really expected my frail body would &s;ink down under the weight of that un&s;peakable di&s;tre&s;s which was upon me, and that my &s;inful &s;oul mu&s;t be centered in a &s;tate of everla&s;ting mi&s;ery. Now the cry was with <HI>Saul,</HI> afterwards <HI>Paul,</HI> with trembling and a&s;toni&s;hment, "Lord! what wilt thou have me to do?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts ix. 6.</NOTE>" There was no holding back, or &s;ecret re&s;erve then, but whatever was called for was given up with all rea|dine&s;s: this being all I could then do. As to per|forming religious duties, I had them all to learn, though I had been trained up from my infancy in a &s;trict religious way by godly parents. But the very be&s;t outward helps, and the mo&s;t con&s;i&s;tent &s;et of religious principles, only profe&s;&s;ed, cannot at all enrich the &s;oul with heavenly grace.</P>
<P>By carefully enquiring as above, I &s;oon clearly perceived my bu&s;ine&s;s was to watch and pray con|tinually; to commune with mine own heart, or the Witne&s;s of God therein, that I might receive fre&s;h in&s;truction and help as I had need. Self-denial, and taking up the cro&s;s daily, was to be my con&s;tant employ; in the doing whereof I had much inward peace and comfort, and a well-grounded hope that I &s;hould thereby find, in the Lord's time, the body of &s;in &s;o weakened, as that the yoke of Chri&s;t would become ea&s;y, and his burthen light.</P>
<P>In order to a happy progre&s;s in the life of re|ligion, the great thing is, by abiding in the Divine Light, to pre&s;erve a clear and di&s;tingui&s;hing &s;en|&s;ibility between the fle&s;h and the Spirit. There is no doing this without great care and &s;teady atten|tion of mind upon the Divine Gift. If the eye goes from this, it is blinded by the darkne&s;s; then

the man is liable to be mi&s;led by a counterfeit light, and various re&s;emblances, which Satan will ca&s;t in his way for guidance and in&s;truction, per&s;uading him all is well and right. To be &s;o mi&s;led, and therein e&s;tabli&s;hed, is a truly deplorable &s;tate; it being very unlikely &s;uch &s;hould ever be per&s;uaded to believe they are mi&s;taken, as they often deride whatever appears doubtful concerning their reli|gion and wor&s;hip. This was evidently the ca&s;e with a &s;et of profe&s;&s;ors of uncommon outward &s;anctity and punctual exactne&s;s in the exteriors of their religion, in the time of our Saviour's per|&s;onal appearance upon earth; notwith&s;tanding which, the&s;e very people appeared to be the mo&s;t inveterate enemies he had among&s;t mankind. See|ing therefore frail mortals are liable to &s;uch dan|gerous mi&s;takes, how exceedingly circum&s;pect and watchful ought all to be! and what frequent and &s;trict &s;crutinies ought they to make into the &s;tate of their own hearts! which can be known no otherwi&s;e by any, but as the Lord is plea&s;ed to &s;end forth his heart-&s;earching light. This is a high favour, which none receive but tho&s;e who are turned from the darkne&s;s, and are fervently con|cerned to put away all the works thereof. Very gro&s;s is the deception of tho&s;e, who imagine the work of their conver&s;ion to be an in&s;tantaneous work. This can be nothing el&s;e but a delu&s;ion of Satan, to &s;ettle people at re&s;t in a &s;tate of &s;elf-&s;ecurity as &s;oon as he can. Oh! what a length of time it takes, to work out that rebellious, &s;tiff-necked, back&s;liding nature, which was born in <HI>Egypt,</HI> before the new generation is rai&s;ed up, that is fit to enter the promi&s;ed land!</P>
<P>From what is before hinted, it may be under|&s;tood, that the Good Seed, or Heavenly Principle,

ari&s;ing into a&s;cendancy in us over the evil &s;eed or principle, and leavening the three mea&s;ures of meal into its own nature, is e&s;&s;entially a being born again, or with water and the Spirit, or being baptized with the Holy Gho&s;t and fire; or man's enduring the operation of the refiner's fire, fuller's &s;oap, and being purified as &s;ilver; all which me|taphors &s;ignify to us, in a very in&s;tructive manner, the different operations of the Holy Spirit; which is to the willing &s;oul &s;ometimes as water, to wa&s;h and bathe in, and al&s;o to drink of freely; at other times as a refiner's fire, to purge away the filth and dro&s;s, that man may be as pure gold, pre|pared to receive the image and &s;uper&s;cription of the King of Heaven; that &s;o, where-ever he goes, or whatever he doth, all who have their eyes opened may &s;ee who&s;e &s;ubject he is.</P>
<P>It is very ob&s;ervable, that the prophet <HI>Malachi,</HI> when he had elegantly &s;et forth the nature of the new birth, breaks out in the forth ver&s;e of the third chapter on this wi&s;e:
<Q>Then &s;hall the of|ferings of <HI>Judah</HI> and <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> be plea&s;ant unto the Lord, as in the days of old, and as in former years;</Q>
which clearly implies man's un|acceptable &s;tate with his Maker in any religious performances, until he hath previou&s;ly known the clean&s;ing and refining operations before-mentioned. What then will become of tho&s;e who have intruded them&s;elves into religious &s;ervices, and among&s;t his faithful followers, not having on the wedding-garment! who would pa&s;s for his people, yet can|not find, by examining the &s;tate of their minds re&s;pecting religion, that they have trod the path of regeneration, nor pa&s;&s;ed through the many and various pangs of the new birth.</P>
<P>When man hath, through the powerful pre|valence of the Divine Principle, obtained victory

in a good degree over evil, his &s;oul abounds with evidence and tokens of his happy attainments, through the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; to whom with the Father, through the influence of the Holy Spirit, prai&s;e, adoration, and thank&s;giving, are offered up as incen&s;e with acceptance; he enjoys an abundant flow of heavenly love, to tho&s;e e&s;pecially of the &s;ame lineage, begotten of the &s;ame Everla&s;ting Father, agreeable to 1 <HI>John</HI> iii. 14.

It is then become as his meat and drink to do the will of God; he looks with indifference upon worldly enjoyment, when compared with religion and the weighty con|cerns thereof; his body, &s;oul, and outward &s;ub|&s;tance are offered up to the Great Giver; being given up to &s;pend and to be &s;pent for the promo|tion of truth, according to the degree of its re|quirings; careful that all he doth may tend to God's glory. The&s;e particulars, and much more than I can &s;et forth, are done from a mature re|&s;ult of a well-informed under&s;tanding and &s;ound judgment, which cannot fail of producing great peace and heavenly &s;olace, whereby he is mightily encouraged to per&s;evere.</P>
<P>Oh! that mankind would but come clearly to &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of beginning in the Spirit, and walking therein, agreeable to the advice and prac|tice of the primitive Chri&s;tians! then they would not fulfil the lu&s;ts of the fle&s;h.

<P>From the&s;e eva&s;ions it appears man hates death to &s;elf, and had rather look any way than that which is likely to &s;trip him of all his beloved trea|&s;ure; though if he was not very blind and ignorant concerning his true intere&s;t, he would ea&s;ily &s;ee that his &s;uppo&s;ed lo&s;s would make way for his greate&s;t gain. However, this unhappy reluctance in man to the true way, has put him upon &s;train|ing his invention, to find an ea&s;ier way to the kingdom of felicity, of becoming heir of two kingdoms; of &s;erving God and mammon, though we are a&s;&s;ured that is impo&s;&s;ible.

Some, who do not fall in with this opinion, but believe they mu&s;t repent, and that they ought to experience the evil purged out by the &s;pirit of judgment and burning, do yet put off this great work, re&s;ting with a kind of hope, that they &s;hall be fitted for everla&s;ting happine&s;s thereby &s;ome time before they go hence; and build much upon the great mercy and long-&s;uffering of the Almighty, catch|ing eagerly at the &s;udden conver&s;ion of <HI>Paul,</HI> and of the thief upon the cro&s;s.

Others there be, who imagine conver&s;ion is effected in an in|&s;tant; and in order that their deception may be effectual, the fal&s;e prophet cau&s;es fire to come down as from heaven in their &s;ight; he that is prince in the airy region, rai&s;es vehement heats and agitations upon their pa&s;&s;ions. This they call the workings of the Spirit upon them for their conver&s;ion; immediately after which a kind of heaven is formed, wherein they take their re&s;t with a &s;eeming &s;ecurity, erroneou&s;ly &s;uppo&s;ing their calling and election are made &s;ure, and that they can never fall from &s;aving grace, which they doubt not of having in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.

<P>Much more might be written concerning the many fal&s;e re&s;ts and vi&s;ionary heavens which poor mortals, through the &s;ubtlety of Satan, and their own inattention, are deluded to repo&s;e them&s;elves

His regenerate ones, though often tried with great poverty of &s;pirit, dare not &s;teal; know|ing nothing will find acceptance with the Source of Infinite Goodne&s;s, but that which is of his own immediate begetting. He will &s;mell a &s;weet &s;avour from that, although it be but a &s;igh or a groan; which may be compared with the acceptable offer|ing of the poor under the law, of a pair of turtle doves, or two young pigeons; and with the wi|dow's two mites ca&s;t into the trea&s;ury, taken notice of by our Lord.* Tho&s;e poor humble dependant ones, who are made perfectly hone&s;t by the ju&s;t and upright principle prevailing in them, and waiting the Lord's time, may be, and often are furni&s;hed with larger offerings, and do greatly in|crea&s;e with the increa&s;e of God.</P>

<Q>Thy kingdom come, and thy will be done on earth, as it is done in heaven.</Q>
This bent of heart, through the grace of God, is a &s;ufficient guard or defence again&s;t all the &s;ubtle attempts of Satan to beguile and de|ceive, and nothing el&s;e. The mo&s;t crafty devices of the adver&s;ary can never prevail to pluck &s;uch an one out of the Almighty's hands; and by abiding therein, he is created anew in Chri&s;t Je&s;us unto good works, having &s;piritual &s;en&s;es given, that he may continually exerci&s;e them in di&s;cerning be|tween good and evil. His heart being made pure in a good degree by the &s;prinkling of the mo&s;t precious blood of Chri&s;t, his con&s;tant care is, through Divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to pre&s;erve it &s;o, that he may be plea&s;ed to tabernacle with him, on whom help is laid; who is made of God, to &s;uch pa&s;&s;ive upright &s;ouls, their wi&s;dom, righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;anctification, and redemption. They receive from him tho&s;e qualifications, which enable them to co-work with the Spirit, and perfectly to under|&s;tand the proper bu&s;ine&s;s of their day, both in the world as &s;trangers and pilgrims, and in the church of Chri&s;t, as living members thereof.</P>

<P>It is clearly to be under&s;tood, by what our Lord &s;aid to the woman of <HI>Samaria</HI> before-mentioned, that acceptable wor&s;hip is not to be confined to any particular place, mode, form, or ceremony what&s;oever; which was a deception mankind had too generally fallen into, and greatly wanted to be drawn from, being then, as well as now, too apt to re&s;t &s;atisfied with exterior performances; which altho' &s;ome of them once were to the Jews in con|de&s;cen&s;ion di&s;pen&s;ed, yet not even then &s;ub&s;tituted in the place of &s;piritual wor&s;hip, nor at all accept|able without the bowing of the &s;oul as above. But now our Lord &s;hews the outward was to be laid a&s;ide, and not to continue in his glorious &s;pi|ritual di&s;pen&s;ation any longer; a dangerous &s;nare for man to plea&s;e him&s;elf with and re&s;t in. But it could hardly be expected that &s;o much, or &s;o great a ma&s;s of outward ob&s;ervations could be ca&s;t off all at once; yet in the apo&s;tles days the church was wonderfully (for the time) brought out of them, as appears by tho&s;e few things laid upon the <HI>Gentiles.</HI>* But alas! the Chri&s;tian church (&s;o called) in&s;tead of leaving all, and becoming purely &s;piritual, gradually decayed as to life and power, and increa&s;ed in ceremonies and outward ob&s;erva|tions, until &s;he became as full of them as ever the Jewi&s;h church was.

Then evangelical light and truth ap|peared, without the blending of ceremonies and outward ob&s;ervations. When the Lord, by his over-ruling power, had erected this ble&s;&s;ed &s;tandard of &s;imple truth, and pure righteou&s;ne&s;s, many thou|&s;ands flocked to it, and &s;poke the language, in a con&s;iderable degree, &s;et forth by way of enquiry, <HI>Cant.</HI> vi. 10.

There is no liberty here to retain a few ceremonies for decency's &s;ake, and to invite the Papi&s;ts over, as pretended by Prote&s;tants; but all are to embrace the &s;ub&s;tance, not daring any more to touch the beggarly elements, &s;o much pro<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">+tuted and defiled during the whole night of apo&s;ta&s;y.

<P>Having offered a few general ob&s;ervations upon the &s;tate of things, it now remains to make &s;ome further remarks upon tho&s;e people &s;o remarkably rai&s;ed, as before hinted, in the la&s;t century, in this our native land: for their beginning and fir&s;t progre&s;s was here, tho' many other lands were al&s;o &s;harers in the brightne&s;s of truth's ari&s;ing in them; and it may without vanity be &s;aid, that through them a light hath extended, or at lea&s;t glanced, over a great part of <HI>Chri&s;tendom</HI> (&s;o called) which hath di&s;covered the hidden my&s;tery of the fal&s;e church more clearly than heretofore, and given a great &s;hake to the long-continued kingdom of antichri&s;t. They have been, through Divine Wi&s;dom, e&s;tabli&s;hed into a firm body, among&s;t whom &s;ub&s;i&s;ts the comely order of the go&s;pel, as an hedge, by divine appointment, for their &s;afety and pre&s;ervation from the de&s;troyer, and out of the polluting defilements of a greatly corrupted world. Notwith&s;tanding which, their pre&s;ervation doth, and always will, much depend upon their diligently &s;eeking unto, and waiting &s;ingly and carefully for a daily renewing of &s;trength and wi&s;|dom from above, whereby alone all things mu&s;t
<PB N="42" REF="010917_0049_0F8529F7DA571A60">
be directed and ordered for their &s;afety and per|&s;everance.</P>
<P>It hath been often accounted by me a great favour and ble&s;&s;ing, that my lot was ca&s;t in a time when primitive Chri&s;tianity, in its power and pu|rity, was re&s;tored in the world; and that I was &s;o happy as to have my birth and education among&s;t the before-mentioned people: for tho' that did not make me a real and living member of their body, yet it happily put me more in the way of being &s;o, than if my lot had fallen in &s;ome of the foregoing dark ages, and afforded me greater means of re&s;toration, than if I had been educated among&s;t &s;uper&s;titious bigots; for which favour, enjoyed by me and many others, there mu&s;t be proportionable returns of thankfulne&s;s and obedience, or it will &s;urely add to our condemnation: for where much is given, much will be required.</P>
<P>Before I had quite arrived to man's e&s;tate, I was, through merciful goodne&s;s operating upon my &s;oul, brought into a better knowledge of, and a nearer intimacy and fellow&s;hip with, the&s;e people in a &s;piritual &s;en&s;e, than before, to my unutterable con&s;olation: for I found the glorious Lord was their king and law-giver, and that he was in|deed become to them a place of broad rivers and &s;treams; and that man's &s;plendid inventions, &s;uch as a galley with oars, and gallant &s;hip, could not pa&s;s among&s;t them:
<Q>For the Lord is our judge, the Lord is our law-giver, the Lord is our king, he will &s;ave us.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. xxxiii. 21. Ver. 22.</NOTE></Q>
This was the ble&s;&s;ed language &s;ounded within their borders. My &s;pirit hath many times been reverently bowed, and awfully pro|&s;trated before the Lord, in beholding the come|line&s;s,
<PB N="43" REF="010917_0050_0F8529F8B08C7B68">
beautiful &s;ituation, and &s;afety of the&s;e his people; in an humble &s;en&s;e whereof I have been ready to &s;ay,
<Q>Happy art thou, O <HI>I&s;rael!</HI> who is like unto thee, O people &s;aved of the Lord! the &s;hield of thy help, and who is the &s;word of thy excellency! and thine enemies &s;hall be found liars unto thee, and thou &s;halt tread upon their high places!</Q></P>
<P>It may be objected that the foregoing contains high encomiums on a people, among&s;t whom we cannot di&s;cover the&s;e excellencies, but have looked upon them as a mean contemptible body, who affect a kind of aukward &s;ingularity; and we ob|&s;erve many among&s;t them as eager after the world, and who love it as well as any people whatever; and others, who take undue liberties, are as deeply involved in the plea&s;ures and gaieties of life, and as much &s;trangers to &s;elf-denial, as people of other per&s;ua&s;ions. And it is further to be noted, that when we go to their places of wor&s;hip, and ob&s;erve the manner of their &s;itting in &s;ilence, a <HI>Laodicean</HI> lukewarmne&s;s is very apparent in many of them, by the ea&s;y, carele&s;s condition they &s;eem to &s;it in, at the &s;ame time they profe&s;s to be waiting in &s;ilence of body, and &s;tillne&s;s of &s;oul, for the de|&s;cending of the Holy Gho&s;t, that their &s;piritual &s;trength may be renewed. Surely, If this is not really &s;o, it mu&s;t be a mockery and deception of the mo&s;t contemptible and provoking nature in the &s;ight of an All-&s;eeing Eye.</P>
<P>In order a little to open the &s;tate of the ca&s;e, and to an&s;wer the foregoing objections, I &s;hall now make &s;ome ob&s;ervations upon the defection in prac|tice that is to be found among&s;t us as a people, e&s;pe|cially of late years, which hath cau&s;ed abundance of pain and heart-aching di&s;tre&s;s to the living body,

who fervently travail that Chri&s;t may be formed in tho&s;e who have a natural birth-righ in the &s;oci|ety, which at pre&s;ent &s;eems to be all the title &s;ome have to be accounted of us. As to the foregoing part of the objection, this people have been indi&s;|criminately viewed in that light by carnal profe&s;&s;ors from their fir&s;t ri&s;e, which di&s;covers the fame undi&s;tingui&s;hing blindne&s;s, as always hath de|prived the children of this world of &s;eeing any beauty or comeline&s;s in the children of light. I have before noted, that I tho' educated in the &s;ame profe&s;&s;ion) did not &s;ee the Lord was among&s;t them, in &s;uch a manner, until he was plea&s;ed to open mine eyes, agreeable to <HI>Matth.</HI> xvi. 16.17. where our Lord pronounces <HI>Peter</HI> ble&s;&s;ed, in that the Father had revealed the Son to him. Chap. xiii. 16. he &s;aid to his di&s;ciples,
<Q>Ble&s;&s;ed are your eyes, for they &s;ee; and your ears, for they hear.</Q>
It is through the &s;ame ble&s;&s;ing mine eyes are yet pre|&s;erved open to &s;ee, that notwith&s;tanding the great declen&s;ion in practice, which hath prevailed over many of us as a people, the glory is not departed from among&s;t us: the King is known by the up|right-hearted in his beauty, &s;till reigning. Princes do yet rule in the &s;pirit of judgment given them of God. My faith is, at times, greatly &s;trengthened to believe it will never cea&s;e to be &s;o among&s;t this people, but that they will be pre&s;erved by the Al|mighty power, through all generations, a living body; and that the principles of truth, as held by them, will yet &s;pread far and wide in the kingdoms of the earth. This, I believe, was the ble&s;&s;ed end for which they were fir&s;t rai&s;ed, and marvelou&s;ly &s;upported: this glorious work hath been in degree going on, tho' very much impeded by the unfaith|fulne&s;s of many among&s;t us, who, like the fooli&s;h

woman, are in &s;ome mea&s;ure pulling down what the wi&s;e woman hath built up. Oh! that all who take upon them our holy profe&s;&s;ion of the un|changeable truth, would deeply con&s;ider the weight of that obligation which they take upon them&s;elves thereby! It is far, O very far! from being a light ea&s;y thing; as it may, in a proper &s;en&s;e, be e&s;teemed an entering into the &s;olemn covenant tho&s;e people are bound to by their God, of holding up a &s;tandard of truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s, altogether meet and &s;uitable for the nations, with &s;afety and well-grounded confidence to draw unto; &s;o that none among&s;t us need be a&s;hamed to call unto mankind thus; <HI>viz. Look upon Sion,</HI> the city of our &s;olem|nity! Oh! it is a lovely &s;ight to behold her walls and bulwarks all &s;alvation, and her gates prai&s;e; when none of her &s;takes are broken down, nor any of her cords loo&s;ened; being indeed the Lord's habitation, as &s;et forth <HI>P&s;a.</HI> cxxxii. 13, 14, 15, 16.
<Q>For the Lord hath cho&s;en <HI>Sion:</HI> he hath de&s;ired it for his habitation. He &s;aith, This is my re&s;t for ever: here will I dwell, for I have de&s;ired it.

<P>Many under our religious profe&s;&s;ion di&s;regarding or lightly e&s;teeming this &s;olemn covenant, and re&s;ting in the profe&s;&s;ion only, is the principal rea&s;on that we find divers under our name more in&s;en&s;ible, harder to be reached unto and awakened by a living powerful mini&s;try, than people of other religious per&s;ua&s;ions. This may &s;eem &s;trange to &s;ome, but I know it is lamentably true; having frequently felt it &s;o in my go&s;pel labours. To me this doth not appear hard to account for, when it
<PB N="46" REF="010917_0053_0F8529FDF566BEF0">
is con&s;idered, that among&s;t us there hath been di&s;pen&s;ed greater abundance of &s;piritual favours, of various kinds, than among&s;t any &s;ociety of people that I know of: which hath not proceeded from any partial regard in the Almighty towards us more than others, but the better to enable us to keep our covenant with him, in the di&s;charge of that great work he hath called us to. Where any are &s;o incon&s;iderate as to di&s;regard and neglect &s;uch wonderful opportunities of la&s;ting benefit and improvement, they become more hardened and impenitent than tho&s;e who have been more out of the way of receiving heavenly impre&s;&s;ions. The portion of &s;uch, unle&s;s they in time embrace the grace of repentance, is very di&s;mal to think of, as in <HI>Prov.</HI> xxix. 1.
<Q>He that being often re|proved, hardeneth his neck, &s;hall &s;uddenly be de&s;troyed, and that without remedy.</Q>
And <HI>Heb.</HI> vi. 7, 8.
<Q>For the earth that drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dre&s;&s;ed, re|ceiveth ble&s;&s;ing from God: but that which beareth thorns and briars is rejected, and is nigh unto cur&s;ing: who&s;e end is to be burned.</Q></P>
<P>Great indeed hath been the bounty of heaven to us as a people, both immediately, by the &s;o|lacing influences and guidance of the Holy Spirit to all that would receive it, and al&s;o by the abun|dant flowing of a truly evangelical mini&s;try, rai&s;ed up and continued for the greate&s;t part of this la&s;t hundred years. But now the &s;ociety is much &s;tript of a living &s;kilful mini&s;try; yet not, nor I hope ever will be, wholly de&s;titute. This, through the divine ble&s;&s;ing, hath been a great means of our being gathered into and pre&s;erved a people! but many among&s;t us have leaned and depended there|upon;
<PB N="47" REF="010917_0054_0F8529FF5BAD01B8">
and therefore it may be, and I believe it is, con&s;i&s;tent with Divine Wi&s;dom, to try how the &s;ociety will &s;tand without &s;o much outward help in that way; tho' perhaps more may be afforded, in rai&s;ing up a &s;pirit for promoting found di&s;cipline and good order, which will prove a ble&s;&s;ed means of its pre&s;ervation. And this mu&s;t be proceeded in by the help and holy influences of the &s;ame Spirit, which furni&s;hes the be&s;t mini&s;try. It looks as if the Lord was about to make his people &s;till more inward and &s;piritual, &s;hewing them plainly, that go&s;pel-wor&s;hip does not depend upon outward means.</P>
<P>It is quite obvious that abundant preaching, praying, and &s;inging, doth not bring a great part of mankind a whit nearer to heaven, nor more acquainted with God and them&s;elves, than they would be without it. So that it may be truly &s;aid, and indeed lamented, that they &s;pend their money for that which is not bread, and be&s;tow much labour without real profit to them&s;elves. With re&s;pect to us, the mini&s;try approved hath abounded with heavenly bread, and refre&s;hing &s;treams of living water have flowed through the conduits and water-&s;pouts to the plantation of God; and altho' many have not improved thereby, yet &s;ome have grown and flouri&s;hed. But the Lord of the vine|yard cannot be confined to any particular means for the help and pre&s;ervation of his church, tho' perhaps &s;uch as he has made u&s;e of in time pa&s;t; &s;eeing he can make other means, unthought of by &s;hort-&s;ighted mortals, as effectual. We may &s;ee he made u&s;e of the people of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> to fight his battles, wherein they &s;eemed, in &s;ome &s;ort, to have been the cau&s;e and in&s;truments of their <HI>own deliverance and pre&s;ervation:</HI> yet it was not always

&s;o; for there are divers in&s;tances of his de&s;troying his enemies, and working the deliverance of his people immediately by his own power. This ap|peared more marvellous and a&s;toni&s;hing, both to his people and their enemies, than the ordinary means u&s;ually employed. Upon the whole, altho' it appears to me &s;omething like a cha&s;ti&s;ement, that &s;o many worthy valiants have been removed, and few rai&s;ed up in the mini&s;try to &s;ucceed them with equal brightne&s;s, this may prove a trial, which, to di&s;cerning eyes, may fully di&s;tingui&s;h between the profe&s;&s;or and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or in religion; yet I believe the true church will grow under this di&s;pen&s;ation of God's dealing with his people. She will be more grounded and &s;ettled in that which is within the veil, <HI>viz.</HI> the holy &s;anctuary and hou&s;e of prayer. There is her place of &s;afety, quite out of the reach of Satan's transformations.</P>
<P>An holy, awful, &s;ilent waiting before God, is &s;piritual <HI>I&s;rael</HI>'s abiding in their tent, where no divination nor enchantment can prevail again&s;t them.

Oh! what wonderful encouragement have the Lord's cho&s;en people, to abide faithful in that &s;tation wherein he hath placed them, whether in &s;ilence or &s;peaking, doing or &s;uffering, pro&s;perity or adver&s;ity. There is not the lea&s;t occa&s;ion to be

a&s;hamed of &s;ilent wor&s;hip, unle&s;s we are &s;o naked, as to be void of a right &s;en&s;e of what true wor&s;hip is. Then indeed it is exceedingly contemptible, and cannot fail of rendering us more de&s;picable in the eyes of mankind, than &s;uch are who have a form, ornamented with man's curious invention and adorning. This mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity center all that are &s;o unhappy in that &s;tate, &s;et forth by our Lord under the metaphor of,
<Q>Salt that hath lo&s;t its &s;avour, which is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be ca&s;t out, and trodden under the feet of men.</Q>
Therefore all profe&s;&s;ors of &s;piritual wor&s;hip &s;hould greatly fear being found in this dreadful &s;tate, of the form truth leads into with|out the life and power: if that is with them, it will rai&s;e them above contempt.</P>
<P>In my travels for the promotion of truth, ac|cording to ability received, which I have been engaged in through mo&s;t parts of our &s;ociety, I have &s;een and painfully felt much of this &s;orrowful idlene&s;s and in&s;en&s;ibility, which has cau&s;ed me many days and nights of morning with &s;ackcloth as it were underneath. I have &s;een that it pro|ceeds from various cau&s;es, but principally from an over-anxiou&s;ne&s;s in &s;eeking after earthly things, lawful in them&s;elves, but direct idolatry when they have the chief place in the mind, and are made the principal trea&s;ure thereof; which they certainly are, when mo&s;t delighted in and thought upon. Then how can it be &s;uppo&s;ed that idolaters can wor&s;hip the true and living God, any otherwi&s;e than in a mere form? With &s;uch the &s;everal branches of our Chri&s;tian te&s;timony are no other|wi&s;e regarded than for outward decency's &s;ake, to keep up the form in the &s;ight of men. So there is a dead form, and an in&s;ipid fruitle&s;s bear|ing

of our te&s;timonies, which can never beget to God, tho' perhaps it may &s;ometimes beget into the form. But this brings no increa&s;e to the Lord's people, except of pain and di&s;tre&s;s. Vi&s;ible di&s;|orders and immoral practices in particulars have often wounded us, and hurt the cau&s;e of truth; but not in &s;uch a dangerous manner; becau&s;e, where &s;ound judgment and the Spirit of whole&s;ome di&s;cipline have been pre&s;erved, the&s;e Things have been judged and ca&s;t out of the Camp. But the greate&s;t wounds we have received have been in the hou&s;e of our &s;eeming friends, by their endeavours to maintain our principles (or at lea&s;t what they liked of them) wor&s;hip, mini&s;try, and di&s;cipline, all in that form only, which the faithful have been, and now are, livingly led into. Antichri&s;t has always made more havock by transforming him&s;elf, than by direct Violence and oppo&s;ition. Let it be ever remembered what <HI>Paul</HI> &s;aith,
<Q>For he is not a Jew which is one outwardly; neither is that Circumci&s;ion which is outward in the fle&s;h: but he is a Jew which is one inwardly; and circumci&s;ion is that of the heart, in the &s;pirit, and not in the letter; who&s;e prai&s;e is not of men, but of God.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. ii. 28, 29.</NOTE></Q>
None, I think, dare deny but it would be equally true, if the word <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> was &s;ub&s;tituted in the room of the word <HI>Jew:</HI> if &s;o, the form, appearance, and character may be attained without the heart-work. We read of &s;ome who had the form even of godline&s;s, yet denied the power, tho' perhaps not in words; for to me it appears the mo&s;t emphatical denial of it, to live and act in the form without it; as this may &s;eem by practice, which &s;peaks louder than Words, to declare to mankind there is no need of the

<HEAD>CHAPTER IV. Containing Short Remarks upon the TRUE and the FALSE MINISTRY.</HEAD>
<P>THE prophet <HI>Joel,</HI> in a remarkable and ex|cellent manner, &s;ets forth the nature of go&s;pel-mini&s;try.

<Q>He that pro|phe&s;ieth, &s;peaketh unto men, to edification, and exhortation, and comfort.</Q>
Indeed great part of this chapter is excellently employed in &s;etting forth go&s;pel-mini&s;try, and the Chri&s;tian liberty all have to exerci&s;e a right call thereunto. But let it be ob&s;erved, the daughters were to be engaged therein, as well as the &s;ons, by go&s;pel law and rule; which was accordingly allowed and practi&s;ed in the apo&s;tolic church. But where the learning and wi&s;dom of man hath been introduced in the place of go&s;pel-mini&s;try, it has, directly contrary to Chri&s;tian liberty, wholly excluded women there|from. What pride and arrogance mu&s;t &s;uch men have, who exclude all from the mini&s;try but them|&s;elves, for filthy lucre's &s;ake! a&s;&s;uming to them|&s;elves the name clergy, calling others laity; a di&s;tinction the true church and the holy &s;criptures

<P>Here is the precious comfortable language of truth indeed, and perfect go&s;pel liberty, which ex|cludes none who have received a gift; that is, who are immediately called of God thereunto, as was <HI>Aaron.</HI>&dagger; <HI>Exod.</HI> xxviii. 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> xxiii. 13. &s;hews at large how <HI>Aaron</HI> was called, and, with his po&s;terity, &s;eparated by the immediate appointment of God him&s;elf. The manner of their qualification, and how they &s;hould conduct them&s;elves in the prie&s;t's office during that di&s;pen&s;ation, are all recorded with that exact clearne&s;s and punctuality, always u&s;ed by the Almighty towards his poor dependent creature man, when he is plea&s;ed to enjoin him the ob&s;ervance of any law or ordinance. Therefore no man ought to receive any thing as an ordinance of God, unle&s;s it appears indi&s;putably clear that he has commanded it; nor yet receive tho&s;e men who have engro&s;&s;ed the mini&s;try to them&s;elves, unle&s;s they appear to have better authority for their undertaking, than their being taught by human means at &s;chools and colleges.</P>
<P>But, alas! the powers of the earth enable many &s;uch to take the fleece, whether they feed the flock or no: Having learned this trade, they appear as anxious how to make the mo&s;t of it as any others.

But through the breaking forth and ari&s;ing of the Light of Truth, they have it not in their power to make &s;uch drudges of magi&s;trates in ge|neral as heretofore. Neither do I think the gene|rality are &s;o much inclined to per&s;ecution them|&s;elves, e&s;pecially among Prote&s;tants, as in time pa&s;t; but do really believe many or mo&s;t of them abhor the &s;evere&s;t part of it, and are men of mode|rate principles.

But mercenary preachers do not receive their Mini&s;try freely; for they alledge, it is attended with great charge to be properly qualified for it; and therefore they mu&s;t make an Intere&s;t of it again, or they &s;hould be great lo&s;ers. The plain truth is, they do not re|ceive their mini&s;try from Je&s;us Chri&s;t; neither can they produce any evidence to prove that they have received a commi&s;&s;ion from him for what they take upon them. Their u&s;ing the Words of Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles affords them no Authority from him; for the very wor&s;t of men, yea the devils them|&s;elves, may do the &s;ame. Oh! what pity it is they &s;hould pretend to be &s;ent of God, amba&s;&s;adors of Chri&s;t, and the apo&s;tles &s;ucce&s;&s;ors! when they re|ally are &s;o manife&s;tly unlike him and them; and have evidently the marks of the fal&s;e prophets and hirelings we read of in the holy &s;criptures, as hath been fully proved again&s;t them by authors of good Account.</P>
<P>Now let us take notice what <HI>Paul</HI> the great apo&s;tle of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> &s;aith upon this &s;ubject,

This plainly &s;heweth, that mini&s;ters in the go&s;pel-times were to convey the quickening Spirit of living and heavenly virtue to mankind; agreeable to <HI>Matth.</HI> xxviii. 19.
<Q>Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in (or into) the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Gho&s;t.</Q>
Ver&s;e 20.
<Q>Lo, I am with you always to the end of the World.</Q>
That this baptizing-teaching with the Holy Gho&s;t was that practi&s;ed in the primitive Church, appears by many pa&s;&s;ages in holy writ; particularly <HI>Acts</HI> x. 44.
<Q>While <HI>Peter</HI> &s;pake the&s;e words, the Holy Gho&s;t fell on all them which heard the word.</Q>
Chap. xi. ver. 15, 16. And (&s;aid <HI>Peter</HI>) as I began to

And &s;eeing the di&s;pen|&s;ation or God to man is the very &s;ame now as it was then, mankind as much involved in &s;in, and e&s;tranged from God as they were then, and the Lord hath graciou&s;ly promi&s;ed to be with his mini&s;ters always to the end of the world, no good rea&s;ons can po&s;&s;ibly be given, why the &s;ame pow|erful efficacious means are not now as e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary for man's recovery, as at that time. There can be no ground for a denial of this truth, unle&s;s a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s in &s;ome that they have not the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Spirit in their mini&s;try; there|fore it &s;eems for their intere&s;t, and for the main|taining

of their credit, to per&s;uade mankind there is no &s;uch thing to be attained now This, with many other in&s;tances which might be produced, plainly &s;hews them to be no other than mini&s;ters of the letter; and that, we read, only kills, when the quickening Spirit doth not accompany the preaching of it.</P>
<P>Very judicious are the di&s;tinctions made by <HI>William Dell</HI> (in his Trial of Spirits both in teach|ers and hearers) between mini&s;ters of the letter, and mini&s;ters of the Spirit; he being him&s;elf a man of literature, and well acquainted with the nature of univer&s;ity Education, as he was ma&s;ter of <HI>Gonville</HI> and <HI>Caius</HI> college in <HI>Cambridge.</HI> I &s;hall ju&s;t make a few quotations from him, and recom|mend that tract, and his excellent treati&s;e on bap|ti&s;m, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to the reader's &s;erious peru&s;al.</P>
<P><Q>And fir&s;t, let me note an Objection, <HI>viz.</HI> but &s;ome will object here, If a man preach the word in the letter, even good, &s;ound, and or|thodox doctrine, no doubt but &s;uch a man is to be heard, and he may do much good in the church, tho' he want Chri&s;t's Spirit: This (&s;aith he) I have heard from very many who have thought they have &s;aid &s;omething. But to this I an&s;wer, That they who want Chri&s;t's Spirit, which is the Spirit of prophecy, tho' they preach the exact letter of the word, yet are fal&s;e pro|phets, and not to be heard by the &s;heep." Again, "They that preach only the outward letter of the Word without the Spirit, make all things out|ward in the Church: whereas in the true king|dom of Chri&s;t all things are inward and &s;piri|tual, and all the true religion of Chri&s;t is written in the &s;oul and &s;pirit of man by the Spirit of God; and the Believer is the only book in which

He further &s;aith,
<Q>They that preach the outward letter without the Spirit, can, notwith&s;tanding that, both live them&s;elves in all the inward evils of corrupted nature, and allow others to do &s;o too. Wherefore, to conclude (&s;aith he) let us know that that church that hath the word, if it wants the Spirit, is antichri&s;t's church; and that mini&s;try that u&s;eth the word, and wants the Spi|rit, is antichri&s;t's mini&s;try; and that all works, duties, prayings, preachings, fa&s;tings, thank&s;|givings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> without Chri&s;t's Spirit, are nothing but the very kingdom of antichri&s;t, and the abo|mination of <HI>de&s;olation.</HI></Q>

<Q>So that true preaching, comes from true &s;ending and this comes from the Grace of God.</Q>
Not, &s;ay I, from the &s;ending of univer&s;ities, bi&s;hops, pre&s;byters, or any other man or &s;et of men what|ever, or from man's intruding him&s;elf thereinto in his own will without a proper call; but from the con&s;training power of the everla&s;ting word of God laying a nece&s;&s;ity, as expre&s;&s;ed by <HI>Paul,</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> ix. 16.
<Q>For tho' I preach the Go&s;pel, I have nothing to glory of: for nece&s;&s;ity is laid upon me, yea, woe is unto me if I preach not the go&s;pel.</Q></P>
<P>It is of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence, towards pro|moting truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s upon the earth, that the mini&s;try be pre&s;erved according to its ori|ginal in&s;titution, <HI>viz.</HI> under the immediate direc|tion

<P>Man &s;hould be &s;o far from proceeding upon cor|rupt motives, for outward gain or advantage, in this important work, that even tho' good-will to man|kind, flowing from the love of God &s;hed abroad in the heart, in which &s;trong de&s;ires may ari&s;e to do good, free from lucrative views of all kinds, and much beautiful go&s;pel-doctrine al&s;o may open very &s;uitable, as the party may think, for the help and edification of his or her fellow-mortals, yet all this is not &s;ufficient to proceed upon, without the call and real gift in this &s;o awful an undertaking; it being no more at the be&s;t than the natural con&s;equence of the operation of that pure love in the &s;aints minds, even in &s;uch as never had a call to the mini&s;try: yet to &s;ome the&s;e ble&s;&s;ed operations, influences, and openings, may be given, in order to prepare them for that Work which they &s;hould wait pa|tiently under, until the full time comes: this will be clearly &s;een, as the eye is &s;ingle.

<P>Incon&s;iderate weak per&s;ons have intruded them|&s;elves into this great work; who not duly waiting for judgment to try the &s;pirits, and what pre&s;ents to their minds, have been beguiled by transformations to go out in a fal&s;e heat; and for want of the holy dread and fear upon their hearts, they have catched hold of the go&s;pel liberty again re&s;tored, (which mu&s;t be pre&s;erved open, le&s;t the Holy Spirit be quenched) <HI>viz.</HI> that all who are called to the work of the mi|ni&s;try, whether male or female, may prophe&s;y or preach one by one, that all may be edified.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. 14.31.</NOTE></P>

Cer|tainly the church hath power to order and regulate her own members; and doubtle&s;s &s;he may wholly

refu&s;e and reject a mini&s;try, which, upon trial, &s;he has in truth no unity with; and even &s;ub&s;tantial members in their private capacity, who have &s;tood their ground well, and have large experience of the Lord's dealings, whether mini&s;ters or others, ought, in rea&s;on and the nature of things, to have great weight with &s;uch who have not yet made full proof of their mini&s;try, nor given &s;atisfaction to their friends in general, as well as to them&s;elves, and perhaps a few others of little judgment. Neither ought any to go abroad to exerci&s;e their mini&s;try, until they know there is a general &s;atisfaction at home therewith; not even to adjacent meetings. Some &s;uch have been very po&s;itive and re&s;olute, hard to be convinced of their mi&s;takes, and cen|&s;orious upon tho&s;e of deeper experience, but too much like that &s;ign of great depravity &s;et forth by <HI>I&s;a.</HI> iii. 5.
<Q>The child &s;hall behave him&s;elf proudly again&s;t the ancient, and the ba&s;e a|gain&s;t the honourable.</Q></P>
<P>Great order and decency is to be pre&s;erved in the church of God, e&s;pecially among the leading members, as way-marks to all. The rea&s;on and nature of the thing demands a proper regard and preference to age, gifts, growth, and experience; which will be always &s;trictly ob&s;erved and paid by tho&s;e of right &s;pirits. When it is otherwi&s;e, it is a &s;ure token of a fal&s;e birth, and that pernicious &s;elf is not &s;lain. Where that predominates, it can|not fail of mixing with their religious &s;ervices.</P>
<P>That the hearers have a right to judge, appears from 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xiv. 29.
<Q>Let the prophets &s;peak two or three, and let the other judge.</Q>
There|fore it is very pre&s;uming for any to take upon them the &s;ole right of &s;peaking and judging too; or to impo&s;e that upon an auditory or church,
<PB N="62" REF="010917_0069_0F852A1386092E68">
which they are not edified with, nor believe to proceed from the right &s;pring; for the word preached doth not profit, unle&s;s it be mixed with faith in tho&s;e that hear it.</P>
<P>I know no way to evade the force and weight of what is above ob&s;erved, unle&s;s it be &s;uppo&s;ed the auditory in general are &s;o void of &s;piritual under&s;tanding, as not to be capable of judging; which would di&s;cover great uncharitablene&s;s, and &s;avour too much of arrogance. I am fully per|&s;uaded, if mini&s;try doth not reach the Divine Witne&s;s in the hearts of the hearers, and cau&s;e them to a&s;&s;ent thereunto in &s;ome mea&s;ure, it will never profit them. The right mini&s;ters have a witne&s;s to the truth of their mini&s;try in the minds of even the rebellious; how much more &s;o then in tho&s;e of the hone&s;t-hearted?</P>
<P>The danger which there is rea&s;on to apprehend from the low, languid, un&s;kilful &s;tate of many in our &s;ociety, hath induced me (and feeling my mind in degree warmed thereunto) to write the more clo&s;ely concerning the nature and pernicious con&s;equence of a fal&s;e mini&s;try, being fully per|&s;uaded, that the more formal and &s;uperficial we as a people become, the more abundant danger there is of &s;uch a mini&s;try ri&s;ing, and finding en|couragement to grow and prevail; for the lifele&s;s, formal profe&s;&s;ors had rather have almo&s;t any kind of mini&s;try than all &s;ilence. And on the other hand, a right mini&s;try cannot have a free cour&s;e, nor be exalted, where there is nothing but worldly &s;pirits, clothed with a form of religion. But true mini&s;ters mu&s;t be like the holy prophet <HI>Ezekiel:</HI>
<Q>And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou &s;halt be dumb, and &s;halt not be to them a reprover; for they are

<P>Having made &s;ome Remarks upon the fal&s;e, as well as the forward and un&s;kilful mini&s;try, which, tho' plain and clo&s;e, I hope will admini&s;ter no hurt or di&s;couragement to any truly concerned in this important work, they may (if duly ob&s;erved) be le&s;&s;ons of caution and in&s;truction to tho&s;e for whom they are intended; and I hope al&s;o a &s;trength to the painfully exerci&s;ed under the cau&s;es of unea&s;i|ne&s;s given by un&s;kilful intruders into the work, whether through weakne&s;s or wilfulne&s;s, that they may not be &s;lack in their endeavours to regulate the &s;ame by plain-dealing, yet with true judgment, love, and tenderne&s;s; all ju&s;tly applied where they &s;everally belong. Their ta&s;k may &s;ometimes be heavy and di&s;couraging, as it is hard to turn tho&s;e who have taken a wrong cour&s;e, and imagine them|&s;elves right, when it is really otherwi&s;e; for tho&s;e have been ob&s;erved to be the mo&s;t po&s;itive of any of their pretended &s;ight and &s;en&s;e, yet let the weight of the &s;en&s;e of truth, which is &s;tronge&s;t of all, be laid upon them from time to time, that the church may not &s;uffer hurt and lo&s;s by the omi&s;&s;ion of its &s;en&s;ible members; which cannot fail of weakening and hindering the growth of &s;uch members al&s;o in an individual capacity. I know it mu&s;t be tho&s;e alive in the truth, of good under&s;tanding and judg|ment therein (and no other) that are qualified to help and direct tho&s;e who have mi&s;&s;ed their way in a religious &s;en&s;e; agreeable to <HI>Gal.</HI> vi. 1.
<Q>Bre|thren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are &s;piritual re&s;tore &s;uch an one in the &s;pirit of meekne&s;s, con&s;idering thy&s;elf, le&s;t thou al&s;o be tempted;</Q>

worldly-wi&s;e; for they have nothing to do to act in the church of Chri&s;t, until they are fir&s;t &s;ub|jected to and taught of the Lord them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The main point, in my apprehen&s;ion, is to be able to form a true judgment of the &s;ource or &s;pring from whence mini&s;try proceeds; and if found to be right in the ground, a great deal of tenderne&s;s is to be u&s;ed, and much childi&s;h weak|ne&s;s is to be patiently borne with. For altho' &s;ome through fear, and a deep &s;en&s;e of the weight of &s;o important an undertaking, may (at fir&s;t) &s;peak very &s;tammeringly, and with con&s;iderable perturbation, yet the &s;weet efficacy of the quick|ening powerful Spirit, which is felt with them in their &s;ervice (by tho&s;e who are circumci&s;ed in heart and ear) far exceeds the fine&s;t eloquence without it. Such &s;hould be prudently encouraged, yet &s;uffered to feel their own feet. There are but few children, however hopeful, that can bear much nur&s;ing and applau&s;e. Oh! the great hurt which hath been done by the forward affectionate part in &s;ome, labouring to bring forth divers before the right time, and by pu&s;hing on others too fa&s;t, who in their beginning were lively and very hopeful, to their great hurt and lo&s;s. Oh! then, what cau|tion and care &s;hould be exerci&s;ed, clearly to &s;ee in the true light what to lay hold of, and what to di&s;|courage in this important re&s;pect.</P>
<P>I now intend to conclude this head with &s;ome plain hone&s;t hints, which have ari&s;en from mine own experience and ob&s;ervation concerning the true mini&s;try, as it hath been re&s;tored again through divine mercy for about this la&s;t hundred years, in greater &s;implicity and purity than has been known (as I apprehend) &s;ince the apo&s;tles days. This hath not been conducted with the inticing words

of man's wi&s;dom, but in &s;uch a demon&s;tration of the Spirit and Power of God, as hath (tho' much de&s;pi&s;ed by the learned Rabbies) been a great ble&s;&s;ing to this and other nations; many thou&s;ands having been thereby turned to Chri&s;t their true and &s;aving teacher, whom they embraced joyfully, as the alone beloved of their &s;ouls. A great number of Churches were gathered to &s;it down as under the &s;hadow of the wings of the prince of Peace. Great was the Lord their God in the mid&s;t of them; their mini&s;ters were clothed with &s;alvation, and their feet &s;hod with the preparation of the go&s;pel of peace. Many then ran to and fro, and the true knowledge of God was increa&s;ed. The Lord gave the word, and many, both male and female, were the publi&s;hers of it. And through divine mercy it may yet be &s;aid tho' the declen&s;ion in practice is great in many) that there is a con|&s;iderable body pre&s;erved, to bear the ark of the te&s;timony of the Lord their God as upon their &s;houlders, in the &s;ight of the people, with their feet as in the bottom of <HI>Jordan;</HI> and a living powerful mini&s;try is yet continued, tho' far &s;hort of the number formerly engaged in that work. For many have grown up among&s;t us, who be|came more &s;uperficial and ea&s;y about po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the &s;ub&s;tance of religion than their ance&s;tors were. Such have relied too much on the mini&s;try, and have not profited in religion thereby. But they have greatly declined in practice, under abundant favours of this kind, the mini&s;try becoming to many as a plea&s;ant &s;ong. They hear the words with plea&s;ure, but do them not; their heart going &s;till after their covetou&s;ne&s;s of one kind or another. Therefore the Lord hath &s;een meet to &s;trip the &s;ociety very much in that re&s;pect; and al&s;o to en|gage

<P>ON every glory there &s;hall be a defence&mdash; That God intended to e&s;tabli&s;h an excellent government, order, and di&s;cipline in the church, under the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation, appears from divers pa&s;&s;ages of the prophets in the Old Te&s;tament, who &s;aw into and wonderfully de&s;cribed the Chri|&s;tian

Chap. xxxiii. 5, 6.
<Q>The Lord is exalted: for he dwell|eth on high, he hath filled <HI>Zion</HI> with judgment and righteou&s;ne&s;s; and wi&s;dom and knowledge &s;hall be the &s;tability of thy times, and &s;trength of &s;alvation.</Q>
Chap. xxviii. 5, 6.
<Q>In that day &s;hall the Lord of ho&s;ts be for a crown of glory, and for a diadem of beauty unto the re|&s;idue of his people: and for a &s;pirit of judg|ment to him that &s;itteth in judgment, and for &s;trength to them that turn the battle to the gate.</Q>
Our Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>Matth.</HI> xviii. 15, 16, 17, 18. clearly directs his followers how to proceed in the exerci&s;e of di&s;ci|pline and good order, both with re&s;pect to indi|viduals, and to the church; he a&s;&s;ured them, that what&s;oever of this kind is done <HI>under divine direc|tion</HI> upon earth, &s;hall be ratified and confirmed in heaven, Chap. xix. 28. he promi&s;es &s;uch who have followed him in the regeneration, that they &s;hall be exalted in his Kingdom, &s;itting upon thrones to judge and govern his people. We find among the eminent gifts of the Spirit, <HI>Paul</HI> reckons <HI>helps in government,</HI> 1 Cor. xii. 28. In chap. the 5th, he blames that church very highly for their neglect of practi&s;ing &s;ound judgment in the way of di&s;cipline, &s;hewing them the nece&s;&s;ity of putting tho&s;e guilty of corrupt practices out of the community, le&s;t as a leaven they &s;hould affect the whole lump. Ver&s;. 11. he points out how un&s;afe it was for the Lord's people to have any &s;ociety with the workers of iniquity. Ver&s;. 12, and 13. that it is the church's duty to judge tho&s;e that are within, <HI>viz.</HI> her own members, leaving the judging of tho&s;e that are
<PB N="68" REF="010917_0075_0F852A1760A6DF18">
without to God. In chap. the 6th, he blames them as &s;harply for going to law one with another before the unju&s;t, &s;hewing that it would have been better they had &s;uffered them&s;elves to have been defrauded, and that every matter of difference or controver&s;y &s;hould be judged and determined by the church, in regard to its own members.</P>
<P>A religious &s;ociety, gathered by God's power, who have received diver&s;ities of gifts and quali|fications, are con&s;idered as a body properly tem|pered by their holy head (who is perfect in wi&s;dom) that it may well exi&s;t by pure laws, rules, and comely orders, both within and without; for the maintaining whereof every member hath its pro|per office and &s;tation wherein it is to act, yet <HI>only by the guidance of the Holy Head,</HI> who is known ever to pre&s;ide over his humble dependent people, a pre&s;ent help in the needful time, &s;upplying all their wants, as they wait his time.</P>
<P>Pertinent to this is <HI>Eph.</HI> iv. 15, 16.
<Q>But &s;peak|ing the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Chri&s;t, from whom the whole body fitly joined together, and compacted by that which every joint &s;upplieth, according to the effectual working in the mea|&s;ure of every part, maketh increa&s;e of the body, unto the edifying of it&s;elf in love.</Q></P>
<P>The apo&s;tle, in 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xii. with great &s;trength of rea&s;on and per&s;picuity, &s;heweth the diver&s;ities of gifts, differences of admini&s;trations and opera|tions, all by the &s;ame Spirit, who worketh in all as he will; that notwith&s;tanding this variety, all, and of all &s;orts, are baptized into one body, and made to drink into one Spirit; he &s;ays, ver&s;. 14. "For the body is not one member, but many;" and &s;heweth they are all u&s;eful to and dependent

upon one another, therefore none have a right to apprehend &s;uch a &s;elf-&s;ufficiency, as to be inde|pendent of other members; nay, that tho&s;e mem|bers of the body, which &s;eem to be more feeble, are u&s;eful. The near union, harmony, and &s;ym|pathy of this glorious body, is &s;et forth in ver&s;e 26.
<Q>And whether one member &s;uffer, all the members &s;uffer with it; or one member be ho|noured, all the members rejoice with it.</Q></P>
<P>For brevity's &s;ake, I forbear at pre&s;ent making more quotations on this &s;ubject. The&s;e are &s;uf|ficient to demon&s;trate fully the &s;trong obligation all baptized members are under, rightly to under|&s;tand their places in the body, and to come up in a faithful di&s;charge of their duty therein, as in the &s;ight of God, to whom they mu&s;t be accountable. And it likewi&s;e appears that every member, en|tered as &s;uch by his or her voluntary con&s;ent, is &s;trictly bound to keep and maintain the e&s;tabli&s;hed rules of that body; the breach of which not only renders him or her guilty in God's &s;ight, but al&s;o accountable to the body. It al&s;o behoves this body, immediately upon the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of its rules and orders, to exert it&s;elf in dealing with tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, and to admini&s;ter &s;ound judgment, in order to re&s;tore them; or, on failure of &s;ucce&s;s in that, to di&s;own or refu&s;e to have unity with &s;uch, and to let the world know they are not of their body; that the reputation thereof may be pre|&s;erved among&s;t tho&s;e which are without, as well as for its own peace and &s;afety within; &s;eeing by a neglect hereof, others may be infected by the cor|rupt member, and his evil may &s;pread in the body like a lepro&s;y; but that which is the mo&s;t affecting, the Lord may be provoked to withdraw from that body which neglects the exerci&s;e of true judgment

<P>When at any time invited to publick &s;olemnities, as marriages and the like, the prudence of the church thought fit to lay re&s;traints upon them, and to forbid them light and ludicrous actions, as leaping and dancing; but that they &s;hould dine and &s;up gravely and mode&s;tly, as becomes Chri|&s;tians; for which he quotes a council of <HI>Laodicea,</HI> 2d part, p. 73.</P>
<P>They took notice of all offences again&s;t the Chri&s;tian law, any vice or immorality that was either publick in it&s;elf, or made known and made good to the church.

For this rea&s;on they watched over one another, told them privately of their faults and failures, and when that would not do, brought them before the cognizance of the church.

<P><HI>Cave</HI> relates, upon the authority of <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar,</HI> that this manner of di&s;cipline was commonly prac|ti&s;ed among&s;t the ancient Druids, who, when any of the people became irregular and di&s;orderly, they pre&s;ently &s;u&s;pended them from their &s;acrifices; and tho&s;e thus &s;u&s;pended were accounted in the number of the mo&s;t impious and execrable per&s;ons: all men &s;tood off from them, &s;hunned their company and conver&s;e as an infection and plague, p. 411.</P>

and therefore without this neither riches nor ho|nour would procure any admi&s;&s;ion into the church: a remarkable in&s;tance whereof was in the emperor <HI>Theodo&s;ius</HI> the Great, who, for his bloody and bar|barous &s;laughter of the <HI>The&s;&s;alonians,</HI> was by <HI>Am|bro&s;e</HI> bi&s;hop of <HI>Milan</HI> &s;u&s;pended, brought to pub|lick confe&s;&s;ion, and forced to undergo a &s;evere cour&s;e of penance for eight months together; at length, after he had pa&s;&s;ed through abundance of

&s;orrow, with tears and great lamentation for his &s;in, he was admitted into fellow&s;hip again, p. 418, 419. So wi&s;ely (&s;ays <HI>Cave</HI>) did the prudence and piety of tho&s;e times deal with offenders, neither lettting the reins &s;o loo&s;e, as to patronize pre&s;umption, or en|courage any to &s;in; nor yet holding them &s;o &s;trait, as to drive men into de&s;pair, p. 429.</P>
<P>Very forward and active have profe&s;&s;ors been, and &s;till are, in heaping up offerings, by perform|ing what they call religious duties, whil&s;t practical virtue has been &s;hamefully neglected. Multitudes profe&s;&s;ing faith in Chri&s;t, and accounted members of his church, are &s;uffered to remain without con|troul or rebuke in various &s;ins and pollutions, to the great &s;candal of the Chri&s;tian name; &s;o that it may be &s;aid iniquity runs down among&s;t them like a mighty &s;tream or torrent, carrying all in a manner before it. What painful apprehen&s;ions mu&s;t fill the minds of thoughtful parents re&s;pect|ing their offspring, when, morally &s;peaking, no other can be expected than that they will be carried away thereby to everla&s;ting de&s;truction! Oh! that it were rightly con&s;idered by all Chri&s;tian pro|fe&s;&s;ors, that obedience is better than &s;acrifices or offerings, and to hearken unto the voice of God, in putting away the evil of their doings from before his eyes, is better than the fat of rams. To what purpo&s;e is the multitude of their &s;acrifices or of|ferings, whil&s;t the mo&s;t weighty matters of the law of God are neglected? <HI>viz.</HI> judgment, mercy, and faith; even that faith which is productive of good works. Let them carefully ponder in their hearts what the Lord by his prophet hath declared, <HI>Amos</HI> v. 21, 22, 23, 24.
<Q>I hate, I de&s;pi&s;e your fea&s;t-days, and I will not &s;mell in your &s;olemn a&s;&s;emblies. Tho' ye offer me burnt-offerings,
<PB N="74" REF="010917_0081_0F852A1BD7965098">
and your meat-offerings, I will not accept them: neither will I regard the peace-offerings of your fat bea&s;ts. Take thou away from me the noi&s;e of thy &s;ongs, for I will not hear the melody of thy viols. But let judgment run down as waters, and righteou&s;ne&s;s as a mighty &s;tream.</Q>
Man is apt to begin at the wrong end, or where he &s;hould fini&s;h; pre&s;uming to perform wor&s;hip and &s;ervice to his Maker before he is in a fit condition to be accepted; as a Being of infinite purity will not &s;o much as look towards him in that &s;en&s;e, whil&s;t he hath any fellow&s;hip with the unfruitful works of darkne&s;s, either in him&s;elf or others. For the Lord will be &s;anctified in all them that come nigh him. He is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity with any a&s;&s;ent or approbation. The contrary of which would be implied, if man was &s;uffered to pre&s;ent his offerings whil&s;t in a defiled &s;tate. The &s;ame that I have here &s;aid con|cerning the acceptance or non-acceptance of indi|viduals, is true, and will hold good, in regard to churches, and countries or nations. Oh, then! how greatly it behoves all who would &s;tand ap|proved in God's &s;ight, to exert their utmo&s;t care and diligence in judging, condemning, and &s;up|pre&s;&s;ing evil of all kinds, fir&s;t in them&s;elves, and then in every branch of the community, as far as lies in their power.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now proceed to &s;hew, that when the Lord was plea&s;ed to re&s;tore Chri&s;tianity in its pri|mitive purity and power, which was in the la&s;t century, church-government, good order, and whole&s;ome di&s;cipline was al&s;o re&s;tored among&s;t an humble, &s;elf-denying people, who were, as God's people in all ages have been, much de&s;pi&s;ed, re|viled, and per&s;ecuted. Yet, through all the hea|theni&s;h

rage of their adver&s;aries, the ri&s;ing up of the rulers of the earth again&s;t them, and the people imagining vain things concerning them, their bands were not broken, nor their cords ca&s;t away. They &s;aw holine&s;s was the Lord's delight, and promoted it with all diligence among&s;t mankind in general, but more e&s;pecially among&s;t them&s;elves. The Lord, who at fir&s;t rai&s;ed cho&s;en in&s;truments, and &s;ent them forth into the world, which was as a briary thorny wilderne&s;s, wonderfully ble&s;&s;ed their ardent labours with increa&s;e, &s;o that in a few years a large number of churches were planted (even amid&s;t all the rage and fury before-mentioned) and quietly &s;et|tled and e&s;tabli&s;hed under the teachings of his Spirit in their hearts. Hereby they grew up in wi&s;dom and &s;tature, and in proce&s;s of time clearly &s;aw, in the Divine Light, that they mu&s;t form them&s;elves into an orderly body, to be governed under &s;uch regu|lations as would put them in the be&s;t capacity, as a religious &s;ociety, of glorifying God, and being the mo&s;t u&s;eful to one another, as members of the &s;ame body; and that al&s;o, by being embodied and di&s;ciplined as an army with banners, they might make a firm &s;tand again&s;t every appearance of evil, with their united &s;trength, under the Captain of their &s;alvation.</P>
<P>Divine wi&s;dom was wonderfully with tho&s;e wor|thies fir&s;t &s;ent and engaged in this ble&s;&s;ed work, di|recting their &s;teps with true judgment, as well as opening the minds of a numerous people, of various growths, to receive the manner and form of govern|ment and order, which tho&s;e of the cleare&s;t &s;ight di&s;|covered, in the Light of Truth, to be be&s;t adapted to promote the glory of God, and the pre&s;ervation of his church and people. Yet there were &s;ome op|po&s;ers (as in the primitive times) even of their own

But the Lord, who knows how to put a &s;top to the rage and cunning devices of the enemies of his church, brought a bla&s;t upon them, which hath expo&s;ed the names of the leaders, and will continue to expo&s;e them through ages and generations to come. Thus the faithful were en|abled to carry on this great work, de&s;igned for the defence and pre&s;ervation of God's people, in defiance of all tho&s;e <HI>Sanballats, Tobiahs,</HI> and <HI>Ge|&s;hems,</HI> which were permitted to ri&s;e up again&s;t them and their godly undertaking.</P>
<P>Great wi&s;dom may be di&s;cerned by tho&s;e eyes only which the Lord hath opened, in his thus rank|ing and placing his people, that they might &s;tand in &s;uch a &s;ituation as to be really true help-mates in Chri&s;t Je&s;us our Lord and holy head; the &s;trong bearing and helping the infirmities of the weak, &s;upporting one another in that which is good, judg|ing down all of a contrary nature to it, in every rank and &s;tation; none daring to be above admo|nition, but rather e&s;teeming it a mark of love and &s;incere regard, that others extend care over them; agreeable to 1 <HI>The&s;&s;.</HI> v. 12, 13, 14.

<P>What an inexpre&s;&s;ible favour it is to be even one of the lea&s;t members of this body, or branch of the heavenly Father's family, where &s;o great help and

On the other hand, what high &s;atisfaction it affords the fathers and mothers in <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> to &s;ee the children and weaklings of the flock of teachable di&s;po&s;itions, and carefully endeavouring to walk according to the truth.

<P>Elders ruling thus in the church are indeed wor|thy of double honour, whether they labour in the word and doctrine or not; being &s;uch as, agreeable to <HI>Peter</HI>'s advice, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> v. 2, 3, 4.
<Q>Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the over&s;ight thereof, not by con&s;traint, but willing|ly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind; neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being en&s;amples to the flock. And when the chief &s;hepherd &s;hall appear, ye &s;hall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.</Q></P>
<P>It is of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence, that the members, who con&s;titute the church of Chri&s;t, be thoroughly acquainted with the true &s;pring of motion and action therein, le&s;t any &s;hould pre&s;umptuou&s;ly conceive

<P>To be capable of acting rightly in the di&s;cipline of the church, man mu&s;t be born of the Spirit, or from above, and receive a qualification from the Ho|ly Gho&s;t for that work.

<P>Nothing can more afflict the &s;ouls of &s;uch, than the darkening coun&s;el by a multitude of words with|out knowledge. We may &s;ee none were properly qualified to judge and govern outward <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> unle&s;s gifted of God for that purpo&s;e. We find they were

There has been no lack of any good thing in the camp of God. The glorious Lord hath been indeed as places of broad rivers and &s;treams, where can no galley with oars, neither &s;hall gallant &s;hip pa&s;s thereby. For the Lord was our judge, the Lord was our law-giver, the Lord was our king, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> xxxiii. 21, 22. and therefore all the &s;plendid art and invention of man in re|ligion, was to be wholly laid a&s;ide, as <HI>Saul</HI>'s ar|mour was by <HI>David,</HI> being concerned to go as he did, in the name (<HI>viz.</HI> the power and dread) of the mo&s;t High. When I did thus &s;tand &s;till, looking upon <HI>Sion,</HI> viewing her beauty and excellency, I have &s;een great things done by mean in&s;truments going forth again&s;t their enemies in the name of the Lord only; which hath cau&s;ed my &s;oul to be knit unto them, and I loved them as mine own &s;oul. This &s;ight and &s;en&s;e of things made me exceeding awful in my mind, afraid to &s;peak and act, unle&s;s I found a well-grounded a&s;&s;urance that the Lord
<PB N="83" REF="010917_0090_0F852A25A322B0A0">
required it of me; by feeling the weight of his divine power upon my &s;pirit, opening my under|&s;tanding, and guiding my judgment, that I might clearly know what when, and how to &s;peak in the awful pre&s;ence of God, and before the princes of his people, who&s;e words I ob&s;erved, were as goads, and as nails fa&s;tened by the ma&s;ter of our a&s;&s;emblies, which are given from one &s;hepherd.</P>
<P>Very pertinent to what I am now upon is <HI>Eccle&s;.</HI> v. 1, 2, 3. and what indeed ought to take deep impre&s;&s;ion on all tho&s;e concerned, <HI>viz.</HI>
<Q>Keep thy foot when thou goe&s;t to the hou&s;e of God, and be more ready to hear than to give the &s;a|crifice of fools: for they con&s;ider not that they do evil. Be not ra&s;h with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be ha&s;ty to utter any thing be|fore God: for God is in heaven, and thou art upon earth, therefore let thy words be few. For a dream cometh through a multitude of bu&s;ine&s;s, and a fool's voice is known by mul|titude of words.</Q>
It is plain from what is be|fore noted, and much more in holy writ, that all the power and wi&s;dom of man, till it be &s;ubjected, &s;anctified, and properly influenced by a &s;uper|natural principle, is wholly excluded from and &s;hut out of the church of God. Although tho&s;e abilities are adequate to, and &s;ufficient for, the things of a man. <HI>viz.</HI> the concerns of this life; (for, as &s;aith our Lord, the children of this world are wi&s;er in their generation than the children of light) yet the things of God no man can know, con&s;equently cannot rightly act in them, but by his Spirit. This al&s;o in part appears from what <HI>Elihu</HI> &s;aith, <HI>Job</HI> xxxii, 7, 8, 9.
<Q>I &s;aid, Days &s;hould &s;peak, and multitude of years &s;hould teach wi&s;dom. But there is a &s;pirit in man: and the

in&s;piration of the Almighty giveth them un|der&s;tanding. Great men are not always wi&s;e: neither do the aged under&s;tand judgment.</Q></P>
<P>Very great hath been, and &s;till is, the lo&s;s of man, for want of deeply under&s;tanding this impor|tant point. Giving a latitude to human abilities in religion, and the concerns thereof, hath opened the door wide for antichri&s;t to become almo&s;t an univer|&s;al monarch. It is that by which he hath got great footing among&s;t all the divi&s;ions of Chri&s;tian pro|fe&s;&s;ors; ours in a &s;orrowful manner with re&s;pect to individuals, as well as others; yet a living body are pre&s;erved. The&s;e, through the divine ble&s;&s;ing, prevent his taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the church, as he has done of others. The eyes and cry of the&s;e are to the Lord, whom they know to be their &s;uf|ficiency; and that unle&s;s he ordain &s;alvation as walls and bulwarks to keep our city, in vain are all human endeavours.</P>
<P>When I have con&s;idered the low, indifferent, lan|guid &s;tate of tho&s;e under our name in many places, both in this and other nations, chiefly occa&s;ioned by an inordinate love of the world, and the things there|of, my &s;oul hath been deeply humbled in awful pro|&s;tration before him; when I have beheld his wonder|ful conde&s;cen&s;ion, in &s;till &s;hining forth upon us, as from between the cherubims of his glory, waiting to be gracious, by turning again the captivity of many of his <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and &s;eeking to rebuild her wa&s;te places, and thereby to revive her ancient beauty.

<Q>The &s;inners in <HI>Sion</HI> are afraid, fearfulne&s;s hath &s;urprized the hypocrites: who among us &s;hall dwell with the devouring fire? who among&s;t us &s;hall dwell with everla&s;t|ing burnings? He that walketh righteou&s;ly, and &s;peaketh uprightly, he that de&s;pi&s;eth the gain of oppre&s;&s;ions, that &s;haketh his hands from holding of bribes, that &s;toppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and &s;hutteth his eyes from &s;eeing evil: he &s;hall dwell on high: his place of defence &s;hall be the munitions of rocks, bread &s;hall be given him, his waters &s;hall be &s;ure.<NOTE PLACE="foot">Chap. xxxiii. 14, 15, 16, 17.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>Oh! how &s;orrowful it is, in this and other nations, for the Lord's me&s;&s;engers to view the great pre|valence of unfaithfulne&s;s in large numbers, in mo&s;t branches of our Chri&s;tian te&s;timony! much whereof hath been greatly owing to the laxne&s;s of di&s;cipline. Tho&s;e who &s;hould have been, above all other con&s;iderations, waiting for fre&s;h and re|newed ability from God to build his hou&s;e, have been mo&s;t of all endeavouring to build them&s;elves and po&s;terity uncertain hou&s;es in earthly inheri|tances; living at ea&s;e in their cieled hou&s;es, whil&s;t the ark of the te&s;timony of God hath been expo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Dreadful will the account be &s;uch will have to render, who have hid their Lord's money in the earth, having wrapped it in a napkin, <HI>viz.</HI> a de|cent form of religion. The Lord hath opened eyes that &s;ee them through their fig-leaf covering in mo&s;t or all the ranks of his people; though it is much to be feared they have clo&s;ed their own eyes, except towards the world. In <HI>that</HI> they may be clear &s;ighted, it being their kingdom. Some of the&s;e may pre&s;ume from their long profe&s;&s;ion, wherein perhaps they have taken care (as far as
<PB N="86" REF="010917_0093_0F852A2E5FFCE760">
appears to man's eye) to pre&s;erve a reputation free from &s;pots or blemi&s;hes; and they al&s;o having a pretty large &s;tock of wealth, in the getting where|of they may have not only dried up the tenderne&s;s of religion in them&s;elves, but al&s;o have laid a foundation for the ruin of their children, or tho&s;e that &s;ucceed them in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; notwith|&s;tanding which, &s;ome &s;uch may take upon them to be active members in the meetings where they belong. Very lamentable indeed are the &s;tates of meetings, managed by &s;uch un&s;anctified &s;pirits. The king of <HI>Sion</HI> is bani&s;hed from their councils; and the precious &s;ons and daughters thereof are but as &s;uffering witne&s;&s;es for God, clothed as in &s;ackcloth; and the &s;eed of God, which &s;hould have dominion in all our meetings, is depre&s;&s;ed. I &s;in|cerely wi&s;h there were no cau&s;e for the&s;e clo&s;e re|marks; a caution of this kind may be nece&s;&s;ary. This &s;pirit getting in among&s;t us, in any part of the body or &s;ociety, cannot fail of laying wa&s;te; therefore let all con&s;ider what &s;pirit rules in them. Where &s;uch a &s;pirit prevails, it is not the wi&s;e woman building the hou&s;e, but the fooli&s;h woman pulling it down with her own hand.</P>
<P>It is a mournful truth, that among the many thou&s;ands of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> there are but few, in compa|ri&s;on, who really &s;tand quite upright, as pillars in God's hou&s;e, who cannot be at all warped by fear, intere&s;t, favour, or affection, but look beyond all &s;ingly at truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s. Oh! what mean cringing, &s;tooping, and temporizing, is to be found in &s;ome! It is my &s;on, daughter, near rela|tion, or friend, that I am loth to offend, le&s;t I &s;hould &s;uffer in my intere&s;t or reputation, or &s;hall gain his or her ill will. This &s;pirit will never dwell on high, but mu&s;t have its portion among&s;t
<PB N="87" REF="010917_0094_0F852A30CCC66A90">
the fearful and the unbelieving; and unle&s;s &s;uch repent, they will be ranked with tho&s;e that deny Chri&s;t before men. They may read their portion, <HI>Luke</HI> xii. 9. True zeal and &s;ound judgment is often rejected by this &s;ort, whether it comes from individuals, or meetings; nay even by &s;ome, when it is the mature re&s;ult of the large&s;t body under the direction of the be&s;t wi&s;dom, if they do not find it agree with their un&s;anctified under&s;tandings; which would be &s;trange if it &s;hould, as it comes from the &s;pirit of Truth.</P>
<P>It may be further ob&s;erved, that tho&s;e who&s;e principal view is only maintaining the form or outward character in religion, feel very little or no pain on account of the di&s;orderly practices of their fellow-members, and therefore they can ea&s;ily daub with untempered morter, and &s;mooth all over, crying peace, before judgment has laid hold of the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing part, and all this done under the &s;pecious pretence of charity and Chri&s;tian tender|ne&s;s. Yet when any in godly zeal are con&s;trained to &s;hew the pernicious con&s;equence of healing the wounds of the daughter of <HI>Sion</HI> deceitfully, &s;ome &s;uch &s;oon di&s;cover they are too much &s;trangers to true charity, by their oppo&s;ition to &s;ound judg|ment, and tho&s;e exerci&s;ed therein, that the wounds might be &s;earched to the bottom. Here &s;omething of a per&s;ecuting &s;pirit appears, and the bitter leaven of the <HI>Phari&s;ee</HI> is di&s;covered, &s;triking at the life of religion. But, agreeable to the u&s;ual craft of antichri&s;t, they mu&s;t call a godly concern and labour by a contrary name, or they could not &s;mite at it with any colour of rea&s;on. Such hone&s;t labourers have &s;ometimes been repre&s;ented as en|thu&s;ia&s;ts, too hot in their zeal, di&s;turbers of the church's peace, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> When there is a peace in the church with wrong things, it is much better
<PB N="88" REF="010917_0095_0F852A30E989BA60">
broke than kept. I take it that it was in this &s;en&s;e our Lord &s;aid:
<Q>I came not to &s;end peace on earth, but a &s;word.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. x. 34.</NOTE></Q>
It was a woeful peace to <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> when they became &s;o reconciled to the in|habitants of the land, as to &s;uffer them to dwell therein, contrary to the expre&s;s command of God!</P>
<P>When the upright in heart cannot for <HI>Sion</HI>'s &s;ake hold their peace, their &s;pirits being truly en|lightened to &s;earch <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> it is very dangerous for any to ob&s;truct, oppo&s;e, or even to di&s;courage them in &s;uch a godly undertaking. The voice of their Almighty Helper is,
<Q>Touch not mine anointed;</Q>
for he will certainly vindicate his own cau&s;e in their hands, and will recompence any injury done to it, or them, as if done to him&s;elf; &s;o that all had need to know well what they do, and what &s;pirit bears rule within them.</P>
<P>Some I have ob&s;erved very blind, fruitle&s;s, and un&s;kilful, who are not quite upon the &s;ame bottom as tho&s;e above-mentioned, but who differ from them in the cau&s;e of their unfruitful &s;ituation, which ari&s;es chiefly from a gro&s;s deception in them|&s;elves, and for want of abiding in that wherein they could try the &s;pirit that pre&s;ents things to their minds. The&s;e have been moved and kindled by a fal&s;e fire, and a zeal not duly tempered with that knowledge which comes from God. This proves a &s;ore wounding to the cau&s;e of truth, where it hath prevailed; very hard to judge down, be|cau&s;e it is commonly very wi&s;e and right in its own eyes. In concluding this head, I am free to expre&s;s an ardent prayer, which hath filled mine heart at times for a con&s;iderable number of years, that the Lord may be graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed greatly to increa&s;e the number of tho&s;e among&s;t us, who are made willing to leave all, and to follow the
<PB N="89" REF="010917_0096_0F852A3199129C10">
gentle leadings of his Spirit, whither&s;oever he is plea&s;ed to lead them; who prefer the welfare, peace, and pro&s;perity of the city of God to their chiefe&s;t joy; that truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s may be &s;o exalted in every part of the body, as to make all the &s;inners in <HI>Sion</HI> afraid indeed: for they cannot &s;tand in judgment when the Lord ari&s;es in maje&s;ty among his &s;aints, nor in the congregations of the righteous; that &s;o for very &s;hame there might be a ca&s;ting their idols of &s;ilver, and their idols of gold, to the moles and to the bats. <HI>I&s;a.</HI> ii. 20.</P>
<P>The &s;ub&s;tance of what is before &s;ignified, is doubtle&s;s, and hath been, the fervent travail of many brethren and &s;i&s;ters, who are deeply affected with the pre&s;ent lethargy which prevails, yet are in the mid&s;t thereof comforted in ob&s;erving great re|viving of a concern, in mo&s;t places, for &s;tirring up and provoking one another to love and to good works; particularly in promoting di&s;cipline: which if it pro&s;pers (as I believe it will) truth and righte|ou&s;ne&s;s will prevail thereby, and <HI>Sion</HI> will enlarge her borders, her cords will be lengthened, and her &s;takes &s;trengthened, and &s;he will yet break forth on the right hand and on the left; her &s;eed will inherit places which are now de&s;olate. Therefore let the true travailers for her pro&s;perity be encou|raged; for I believe &s;ome of them will come to &s;ee the fruits of their painful travail, and be &s;a|tisfied. May all &s;uch keep their habitations in a feeling &s;en&s;e of the Holy Head, whether in &s;uf|fering or rejoicing, pro&s;perity or adver&s;ity! For, as &s;aith the apo&s;tle,
<Q>If we &s;uffer with Chri&s;t, we &s;hall reign with him, or be glorified to|gether.</Q></P>
