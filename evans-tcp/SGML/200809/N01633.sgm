<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING been favour'd with the Read|ing the En&s;uing <HI>Treati&s;e,</HI> I de&s;ire heartily to ble&s;s GOD, who has gra|ciou&s;ly directed and led his <HI>Servant</HI> into, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in the <HI>Compo&s;ing</HI> it, and inclin'd him to <HI>Publi&s;h</HI> it. The <HI>Subject</HI> is certainly the be&s;t cho&s;en that can be for Univer&s;al and perpetual <HI>U&s;e</HI> to Souls, both for the Convin|cing and Converting <HI>Sinners,</HI> and the quickning of <HI>Saints.</HI> The De&s;ign of this <HI>Epi&s;tolary Pre|face</HI> is, if it may plea&s;e God, to impre&s;s the <HI>Readers</HI> Soul with a &s;erious Con&s;ideration of the <HI>Importance</HI> of the great and nece&s;&s;ary <HI>Truths</HI> here prepared for him, and to be&s;peak a very <HI>&s;e|rious Attention</HI> to them while he reads them. For how <HI>awful,</HI> affecting and awakening &s;hou'd it be to Mankind to hear of that <HI>Great and Glorious Salvation revealed and offered to Sinners in and by the Go&s;pel, and the great and unavoidable Mi&s;ery which the Neglect of it will bring upon us.</HI> This Great Subject
<PB N="ii" REF="001939_0003_0FBA2670D55DB230">
is here handled in the mo&s;t plain and &s;erious <HI>manner,</HI> with a pure Aim and &s;incere Zeal (to make the mo&s;t <HI>upright Judgment of Charity</HI> I am able to form) to inform the Minds and enter into the Con&s;ciences of Men.</P>
<P>Sinners are here &s;hewn the <HI>Need</HI> they &s;tand in of Salvation; the <HI>Way</HI> of Salvation is opened; the great and glorious <HI>Nature</HI> of the offer'd Salvation is con&s;idered; the <HI>pronene&s;s</HI> which there is in Men to neglect it is di&s;covered; the <HI>actual</HI> neglect of it among Men is lamented; and the great and <HI>unavoidable Mi&s;ery</HI> which this Neglect will bring upon Men is faithfully and &s;olemnly declared. The&s;e great Things (which are the <HI>whole of Man</HI> and the <HI>one thing needful)</HI> are here di&s;cours'd in a Scrip|tural and rational manner; and the whole <HI>Ar|gument</HI> is manag'd in a Method and Stile very &s;olid and judicious, clear and di&s;tinct, earne&s;t and moving; &s;uch as the Weight, Gravity and Solemnity of the <HI>Subject</HI> calls for.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the great <HI>points</HI> which the Souls of <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> &s;hould be intently fixed on, if they would <HI>take heed to the Mini&s;try which they have received of the LORD that they fulfil it:</HI> And the&s;e things mu&s;t perpetually im|ploy the Minds of <HI>&s;erious Chri&s;tians</HI> in the working out their own Salvation, as well as be continually Inculcated upon <HI>carele&s;s Sinners</HI> for their Awak'ning and Conver&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="iii" REF="001939_0004_0FBA2672CCB24268">But the great thing now to be de&s;ir'd and en|deavour'd is, that the <HI>Reader</HI> may bring a Mind &s;eriou&s;ly di&s;pos'd to <HI>receive the Truth.</HI> And O that Men would &s;uffer them&s;elves to be wro't upon to con&s;ider thoroughly the&s;e <HI>Three</HI> things: The <HI>Greatne&s;s</HI> of that Salvation which is pur|cha&s;ed by the LORD JESUS CHRIST for them and freely offered to them: the <HI>Shameful Neglect</HI> of it by Chri&s;tians; and the in&s;uppor|table <HI>Mi&s;eries</HI> which Men unavoidably bring upon them&s;elves by this Neglect.</P>
<P>No wit or words of Man can at la&s;t rep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;ent, no <HI>tongue of Men or Angels</HI> can &s;ay, how GREAT this SALVATION is.

<P>But how <HI>&s;ad</HI> is it to con&s;ider how &s;hamefully Men <HI>de&s;pi&s;e their own Souls,</HI> and <HI>neglect</HI> the Great Salvation! O the infatuation and &s;tupidity of <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> and O their Guilt and

This <HI>neglect</HI> of our &s;elves is a mo&s;t criminal <HI>Contempt</HI> of GOD: and the <HI>one</HI> is not more impious and ungrateful, than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>other</HI> is unnatural, unju&s;t, cruel and barba|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">us.

<P>What need is there often to put the <HI>awful Que&s;tion</HI> to our &s;elves, <HI>How &s;hall we e&s;cape&mdash;?</HI> Is our Salvation too &s;mall an Intere&s;t for our Concern? Are the matters of our Eternal Welfare mean and trivial? Have we any greater and more worthy care to take us up?</P>
<P>O therefore that Sinners would but give way to tho&s;e <HI>ju&s;t Fears</HI> which the Word of the Living GOD would excite in them! Would they but &s;it down and &s;olemnly ask them&s;elves, How think I to e&s;cape the Vengeance of GOD? What will become of me at long run? Is not GOD's Word true? Is the Wrath therein revealed again&s;t Im|penitent Sinners &s;ufferable? Can I be content to

Can my heart endure, or my hands be &s;trong, in the day when he &s;hall deal with me?</HI> How can I read or hear the Threatnings of GOD's Law and not <HI>exceedingly fear and quake?</HI> Why &s;hould they not be to me in GOD's <HI>Word,</HI> and in the Mouth of his <HI>Mini&s;ters,</HI> as if I heard them from the <HI>burning Mountain,</HI> utter'd in <HI>Thunders</HI>? from the dark <HI>Cloud</HI> bur&s;ting with fla&s;hes of Fire? Can I be willing to be <HI>Damned?</HI> Am I come to <HI>that</HI> point, and ea&s;ie in the Apprehen&s;ion? Am I a Stock or a Stone? Is my Soul Iron or Marble? Will nothing make Impre&s;&s;ion on it? <HI>Do I not fear GOD being under Condemnation, and indeed ju&s;tly?</HI> Have I con&s;idered what Damnation is? Is there any thing &s;o fearful? Are any of our Fears <HI>equal</HI> to it? Why then do I not fear and <HI>fly</HI> from the Wrath of the Almighty? Why do I run upon his <HI>Bo&s;&s;es,</HI> and on the point of his Sword? Why do I dare his Vengeance? Why am I &s;o &s;ecure and quiet while I lie open to it? Why do I not hearken <HI>now</HI> to my own <HI>Con&s;cience</HI> and take its Alarms, before it change from a faithful <HI>Monitor</HI> into my Eternal furious Ene|my, Avenger and <HI>Tormentor?</HI> Are its re|mor&s;es and reproaches too unea&s;ie now already to bear? But O the la&s;hes and &s;tings of it will be infinitely more torturing and peircing in the place

of Devils and of De&s;pair; when the offer of Sal|vation is never, never to be made again, and the Mi&s;ery of Exci&s;ion from GOD comes into actual bearing!</P>
<P>Thus methinks Sinners under the Go&s;pel &s;hould be making their <HI>Reflections,</HI> cheri&s;hing tho&s;e wi&s;e and proper <HI>Fears</HI> which are nece&s;&s;ary to their effectual Excitation unto an in&s;tant and mo&s;t earne&s;t care for their own Salvation.</P>

down,</HI> hath truly given him the <HI>Tongue of the Learned,</HI> to divide to every one his Portion, to plea&s;e and profit, convince, per&s;wade and di|rect.

<P N="1">1. IF we look into Man's <HI>pre&s;ent natural E&s;tate</HI> it will appear to be &s;uch as &s;hews his ab&s;olute need of Salvation. For,</P>
<P N="1">(1.) <HI>EVERY man is naturally de&s;titute of the Image of God,</HI> even of that knowledge of God, Righteou&s;ne&s;s and true Holine&s;s, which was e&s;pecially the Image of God up|on him, according to which he was at fir&s;t created. This was Man's peculiar dignity at fir&s;t, which nothing el&s;e in this lower World was capable of; this was a greater honour to Man, than his Empire and Do|minion over the World, becau&s;e this ren|der<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d him capable to glorify God and con|ver&s;e with him, which is the highe&s;t honour that can be put upon a Creature; but this Man lo&s;t, and all Men have lo&s;t it together with him. Rom. 3.23. <HI>All have &s;inned and come &s;hort of the glory of God.</HI> Hence no Man naturally hath a Heart to know, to choo&s;e and love God as his chief good; to &s;erve and glorify him as his la&s;t end; to &s;eek after conformity to him, and communion with him as his true ble&s;&s;edne&s;s: but hath a di&s;po&s;ition quite contrary hereunto. Now &s;uch a lo&s;s as this is an inconceivable mi&s;ery:
<PB N="9" REF="001939_0018_0FBA26930AC9DF10">
for by rea&s;on hereof the primitive rectitude, harmony and beauty of the Soul is lo&s;t. Man is not like what he was when he came out of the hands of God. Surely Man needs to have &s;uch a lo&s;s repaired, and thereby his primitive health and beauty re&s;tored.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) <HI>THE Nature of Man is univer&s;ally cor|rupted.</HI> Original purity and rectitude being lo&s;t, there naturally follows an univer&s;al de|filement and deformity upon the whole Soul, and it is wholly di&s;ordered and out of cour&s;e in all tho&s;e ways wherein it exerts it&s;elf. <HI>Gods Image</HI> being lo&s;t, <HI>Satans Image</HI> is intro|duced. In&s;tead of a holy there is a &s;inful nature, in&s;tead of purity, pollution. God him&s;elf gives that te&s;timony concerning Man, Gen. 6.5. <HI>That the imagination of the thoughts of his heart, were only evil continually.</HI> Sinful motions do as naturally ri&s;e out of the heart as &s;parks from the Fire, or filthy &s;teams from a Dunghill. And we find many holy Men in Scripture acknowledging and lamenting this natural pollution, con|fe&s;&s;ing its clo&s;e adherence to them, from their fir&s;t being and acting. So <HI>David,</HI> P&s;al. 51.5. <HI>Behold I was &s;hapen in iniquity, and in &s;in did my mother conceive me.</HI> So the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> Rom. 7.18 <HI>I know that in me (that is in my fle&s;h) dwelleth no good thing,</HI> i e.

holy di&s;po&s;itions in it, and therefore will not produce any holy actions. In the &s;ame <HI>Context,</HI> he &s;peaks of it not only as, <HI>impotent to good</HI> but <HI>full of contra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ry again&s;t it.</HI> Ri&s;ing and rebelling again&s;t any thing that is holy when pre&s;ented to, and excited in it; and holy <HI>Job</HI> is under&s;tood as bewailing the corruption of nature in that expre&s;&s;ion, Job 14.4. <HI>Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean</HI>: intimating that all are by nature &s;tained and defiled. And as this pollution extends to all Men &s;o its contagion over|&s;preads the <HI>whole man.</HI> Man is wholly corrupt; both Soul and Body are tainted with Sin, to allude to that, I&s;ai. 1.6. <HI>From the crown of the head, to the &s;ole of the foot, there is no part clean.</HI> Hence the Soul is naturally running to evil, and readily imbracing the &s;ollicitations <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> it meets with; and <HI>the members of the Body are</HI> ready <HI>in&s;truments of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>THIS may be a little <HI>Illu&s;trated</HI> in the <HI>&s;everal Faculties</HI> of the Soul.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>THE Under&s;tanding,</HI> the leading Facul|ty of the Soul is wholly corrupted. Hence full of mi&s;takes and darkne&s;s in its appre|hen&s;ions: erroneous in its judgment, fooli&s;h in its rea&s;onings, evil in its de&s;igns, vain in its thoughts. Hence ari&s;es low and mean and unworthy thoughts of God. <HI>P&s;al.</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="001939_0020_0FBA2696289A64D8">
50.21. When God offers him&s;elf as a fit portion and happine&s;s for the Soul, it can &s;ee no amiablene&s;s in him, but prefers <HI>broken Ci&s;terns</HI> before the <HI>Fountain of living waters.</HI> Hence it is &s;o hardly and not without the powerful irradiation of the <HI>Spirit,</HI> convinced of its mi&s;ery and wretchedne&s;s in its di&s;tance and e&s;trangement from God.

How &s;u&s;ceptive and tenacious of Error? How many carnal rea&s;onings again&s;t the mo&s;t Spiritural truths? What &s;warms of fooli&s;h impertinent, yea wicked &amp; helli&s;h thoughts are &s;tarting up in the imagination and fan|cy, and too often brooded and cheri&s;hed there?

That would not hearken to him, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 3.7.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE <HI>Memory</HI> which &s;hould be the Trea&s;ury and Store-hou&s;e of the Soul of proper and &s;ea&s;onable Truths, for its di|rection and comfort, how unfaithful in its office? how ready to receive and entertain and produce what is evil, and to exclude and let &s;lip what is good? How often doth God condemn and upbraid his people for their forgetfulne&s;s and incogitancy: <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 106.21. They forgot God their Saviour. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 106.7. They remember'd not the

And how much of the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition may we find; a forgetful|ne&s;s of mercies and benefits, forgetfulne&s;s of vows and promi&s;es, forgetfulne&s;s of com|mand's that are often urged, and repeated. Our memories are too like Sieves that let out the flower and retain the bran. Thro' the corruption of this faculty the &s;ame Sin becomes often repeated by us.</P>
<P N="4">4. THE <HI>Affections</HI> of the Soul are de|praved and out of cour&s;e. Hence tho&s;e things that &s;hould be loved, de&s;ired and de|lighted in, are di&s;liked, rejected and hated; and tho&s;e things which &s;hould be hated are loved. God him&s;elf who is an infinite, im|mutable and everla&s;ting Good, and &s;hould be loved with all the heart, &s;oul and &s;trength, is di&s;regarded and &s;lighted, and the peri&s;hing objects that the World offers, preferred above him. Hence you read, 2 Tim. 3.4. <HI>That they are lovers of plea&s;ure more than lovers of God.</HI> Jer. 2.13. <HI>They have for&s;aken the fountain of living waters, and hew|ed out to them&s;elves ci&s;terns, broken ci&s;terns that can hold no water.</HI> The Creature is preferred above the Creator, and Men are naturally &s;eeking a fal&s;e happine&s;s in the profits, ho|nours and plea&s;ures of the pre&s;ent life, and neglecting a true and &s;olid felicity in God.

Yea not only the peri&s;hing things of time are idoliz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d and doated upon, but carnal and &s;inful objects, forbidden plea&s;ures, &s;uch as corrupt, defile and debilitate the Soul, are eagerly pur&s;ued and inordinately delighted in. The like may be &s;aid of the pa&s;&s;ions of the Soul, grief, anger, fear, &s;orrow, the&s;e are readily carried to wrong objects.</P>
<P N="5">5. THE <HI>Con&s;cience</HI> is al&s;o wofully cor|rupted. Con&s;cience is that power in Man whereby he was made capable to con&s;ider, review and pa&s;s a judgment upon his own actions. It is Gods monitor in the Soul, to accu&s;e when we act contrary to the rule he hath given us, and to approve when we do what is right.

Some|times thro' ignorance it is &s;leepy and &s;en&s;e|le&s;s, don't ob&s;erve and condemn for &s;in as it ought, and &s;ometimes approves what it &s;hould condemn.

them in this condition. But alas! how ma|ny are to be found with whom it is quite o|therwi&s;e, who are full of carnal mirth and jollity, altogether unconcern'd and in&s;en&s;i|ble about any Soul wants or dangers: the guilt of &s;in is no burden to them, the wrath of God is no terror to them. And though they have the offers of Salvation daily &s;ounding in their Ears, and repeated calls and encouragements to put in for a &s;hare in the ble&s;&s;edne&s;s offered, yet are unaffected and unconcerned about them. To promote the awakening of &s;uch &s;otti&s;h and &s;leepy &s;in|ners, let me propo&s;e two or three things.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) IF you are not convinced of your need of Salvation as in &s;ea&s;on duty to &s;eek after it, <HI>Damnation will certainly be your por|tion.</HI> For there is no middle &s;tate between the&s;e: it is not only a matter very probable that you will fall under the wrath and cur&s;e of God, and be cut off from hopes of mercy and comfort hereafter if you neglect this, but it is certain: the ruin of impenitent and unbelieving &s;inners is po&s;itively declared, Mar. 16.16. <HI>He that believeth not &s;hall be damned&punc;</HI> and Rom. 2.4, 9.

Immortality: you mu&s;t be ca&s;t out into outer darkne&s;s where will be &s;orrow and &s;hame, pain and grief, vexation and an|gui&s;h. Were there any hopes of being hid from the revenging hand of God, or after a while that you &s;hould be annihilated and cea&s;e from the number of beings; or that your <HI>Spirits</HI> at Death like the <HI>Bea&s;ts &s;hould go downward,</HI> never any more to be regarded: this would be &s;ome plea to excu&s;e your care|le&s;sne&s;s and &s;ecurity in this matter: but when it is certain that damnation and mi|&s;ery is like to be your portion and puni&s;h|ment, continuing in this e&s;tate, your care|le&s;sne&s;s is inexcu&s;able. Is <HI>Hell</HI> &s;o ea&s;y a place, is the wrath of God &s;o &s;light a mat|ter, that you need not trouble your &s;elf with any concern to e&s;cape it? Can you tell what it is to bear the revenges of de&s;|pi&s;ed Mercy and incen&s;ed Ju&s;tice? Can you bear the weight of an Omnipotent One? The angui&s;h of the never dying Worm? The burning heat of tho&s;e Flames that never &s;hall be extingui&s;hed? Surely <HI>de&s;truction from God &s;hould be a terror to you!</HI> And the dread of damnation &s;hould make you concerned to obtain Salvation, and diligently to improve your opportunities in order to it!</P>

What tho' they have got their &s;ins pardoned, which you have not, yet you have had the&s;e and tho&s;e &s;en&s;ual delights and carnal plea&s;ures, which they han't. While they have gotten a title to the Pro|mi&s;es, an <HI>Heavenly Inheritance,</HI> you have got you a good Hou&s;e well furni&s;hed, and plen|tiful accommodations for the World, which they want. While they are beloved of God, you are applauded, re&s;pected and honoured among Men. Will &s;uch thoughts refre&s;h and &s;atisfy you now, or rather will not con&s;cience make &s;ad reflections upon you? And how much more will it do &s;o at the approaches of Death, and when you mu&s;t appear before the Judgment Seat of Chri&s;t? when all &s;uch things &s;hall appear to be trifles and vanities, no more able to relieve you than <HI>Dives</HI>'s former &s;plendor did him when <HI>horribly tormented in the flames</HI> of Divine wrath.</P>

without it: But it ari&s;es from the &s;leepine&s;s of their con&s;ciences, and the blindne&s;s of their minds, and the hardne&s;s of their hearts. From the power that &s;in hath in them, or the influence that Satan hath over them: &s;ome are hardened thro' the deceitfulne&s;s of &s;in; that hearken to the flattering promi&s;es that it makes of profit and plea&s;ure, that it will yield them; and their love to it blinds them that they can't &s;ee the evil of it, nor believe the danger attending of it, <HI>but pre|&s;ume they &s;hall have peace tho' they walk after the imagination of their evil hearts</HI>: Plea&s;e them|&s;elves that God either minds not their &s;ins, or is not offended at them; or they <HI>put far away the evil day.</HI> Or it is from the power and influence of Satan over them, they are infatuated by him. The <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> &s;peaks of &s;ome, 2 Cor. 4.4. <HI>Who&s;e eyes the god of this world hath blinded, lea&s;t the light of the glorious go&s;pel of Chri&s;t &s;hould &s;hine into them.</HI> And there are abundance of methods he u&s;es to this pur|po&s;e, to &s;trengthen fal&s;e peace and an un|grounded hope in them; which I &s;hall not go about to enumerate.

Now to further a right &s;en&s;e hereof, let me offer the following Advice.</P>
<P N="1">1. HAVE a care of judging and deter|mining your &s;tate by fal&s;e rules, of comfort|ing your &s;elves with hopes of the goodne&s;s of your &s;tate upon fallible and uncertain
<PB N="32" REF="001939_0041_0FBA26C9C99F8810">
grounds. This is one thing that mi&s;leads many and hardens them in their &s;ecurity. If the rule be fallible the judgment you pa&s;s upon your &s;elves by it can't be certain. Now there are many fal&s;e rules by which Men are comforted. <HI>Some</HI> think their condition good becau&s;e of their frequency in attending the external duties of Religion. This was the confidence of the <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> Luk. 18.11. <HI>I fa&s;t twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I po&s;&s;e&s;s.</HI> It is repre&s;ented as a plea that &s;hall be rejected by Chri&s;t, which yet &s;ome will make: Luk. 13.26. <HI>We have eaten and drank in thy pre&s;ence, and thou ha&s;t taught in our &s;treets.</HI> External duties of Religion may be fre|quently attended and that with much &s;eem|ing devotion and &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, from cu&s;tom, example and education, terrors of con&s;cience, where there is no principle of Grace in the heart. <HI>Others</HI> are comforted upon account of their <HI>moral &s;trictne&s;s,</HI> and the con&s;cienti|ou&s;ne&s;s of their carriages; they live &s;oberly and righteou&s;ly among Men, and dare not indulge them&s;elves in &s;uch loo&s;e, vain and di&s;orderly practices as &s;ome do: This was the confidence of the <HI>Young Man</HI> that came to Chri&s;t, Mar. 10.20. <HI>All the&s;e have I ob|&s;erved from my youth.</HI> Morallity is amiable and commendable, but Men may be put up|on this either out of re&s;pect to their Inte|re&s;t,
<PB N="33" REF="001939_0042_0FBA26CDF3958160">
or to promote their reputation and e&s;teem among Men, or may be &s;car'd into it thro' terrors of Con&s;cience and fears of Hell. Con&s;cientious Men are not all holy. Again, <HI>Some</HI> comfort them&s;elves becau&s;e of the <HI>good affections</HI> that they feel many times &s;tirring; they have relentings for &s;in, and can mourn for their &s;inful carriages; their hearts are &s;ometimes enlarged in the duties of Wor&s;hip they attend; they find &s;ome de|light and joy in hearing of the Word, they are affected with the Sufferings of Chri&s;t, with the Glory of Heaven, have de&s;ires after Grace, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but there are religious which are not gracious affections. There is a <HI>Legal</HI> as well as an <HI>Evangelical &s;orrow</HI> for &s;in. <HI>Judas</HI> was much affected with his &s;in, and as you read, repented. <HI>Ahab humbled him&s;elf.</HI> The Stony ground hearers <HI>received the word with joy,</HI> were much affected with it. Of <HI>Johns Bapti&s;ts</HI> hearers you read, Joh. 3.35. <HI>That they were willing for a &s;ea&s;on to rejoyce in his light</HI>; were much awakened by and affected with his Mini&s;try.

So that &s;uch working of affection can be no &s;olid ground on which you may conclude your
<PB N="34" REF="001939_0043_0FBA26CF231A7EF8">
e&s;tate to be good; and to add no more, <HI>Some</HI> are attempting to comfort them&s;elves becau&s;e of &s;ome <HI>re&s;emblances of Grace</HI> that they have; They de&s;ire to be ju&s;tified by the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, they have a Love to &s;ome of the People of God; they have a Heart open to relieve tho&s;e that are poor and nece&s;&s;itous; they have a zeal a|gain&s;t Sin; they are willing to own and defend the Cau&s;e of God, and to improve their E&s;tates for the &s;upport of his Wor&s;hip and Ordinances. But many &s;uch things as the&s;e may be found where there is no true Grace. A Man may de&s;ire to be ju&s;tified by Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and yet not clo&s;e with him upon the terms of the Go&s;pel. Men de&s;ire abundance of things that they never attain. There may be Love to Good Men upon &s;elfi&s;h motives, becau&s;e they are related to them, or becau&s;e they have been benefi|cent towards them; not becau&s;e they Love God or his Image appearing in them: and as for zeal again&s;t Sin, it is many times par|tial or &s;elfi&s;h. <HI>Jehu</HI> was zealous again&s;t the <HI>Idolatry</HI> of <HI>Baal</HI>; but his zeal was wild fire, not the fruit of holy Anger again&s;t Sin, and Love to the purity of God's Wor&s;hip. And Men may be &s;erviceable with their E&s;tates to the Wor&s;hip of God, where there is no true Grace. 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 26.28. You read of things

and weighty ends for which they are be|&s;tow'd. Now there was a nece&s;&s;ity of both the&s;e to the bringing home Salvation to the Souls of Men. Had not care been taken for the <HI>Application</HI> as well as the <HI>Impetration</HI> of Redemption, the ca&s;e of fallen Man con|&s;idering his impenitency and ob&s;tinacy, had been &s;till deplorable: But the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t having &s;atisfied the Ju&s;tice of God, and pro|cured favour for &s;inful Man, he informs us that the <HI>de&s;cent of the Spirit</HI> &s;hould be one eminent fruit and te&s;timony of it. And by minding them of this, comforts his <HI>Di&s;ciples</HI> when greatly dejected with the thoughts of his bodily <HI>ab&s;ence from them,</HI> Joh. 16.7. And though the Church in all Ages have been in &s;ome degree priviledged with the pre&s;ence of the <HI>Spirit,</HI> yet the more large and plenti|ful communications of it hath been re&s;erv'd to the <HI>times of the Go&s;pel</HI>; it being the great and &s;pecial promi&s;e that had been given for tho&s;e times, as may be &s;een in many <HI>Texts</HI> of <HI>Scripture,</HI> Joh. 7.37, 37.

And on this account checks the folly of the <HI>Judaizing Galatians,</HI> that they were grown fond of the <HI>Mo&s;aick Rites,</HI> and had abated in their valuation and e&s;teem of the Go&s;pel, by minding them of the privi|ledge

<P N="2">(2.) IT is a Salvation from <HI>Hell.</HI> Sin is the wor&s;t of <HI>moral evils,</HI> and Hell is the wor&s;t of <HI>penal evils</HI>; but this al&s;o Chri&s;t &s;aves his People from. 1 The&s;. 1.10. <HI>Je&s;us which de|livered us from wrath to come.</HI> Sin had en|tail'd

<P>THEY who are brought to clo&s;e with the offers of it are brought into a &s;tate of <HI>Peace and Reconciliation with God.</HI> The dreadful breach that &s;in had made between God and the Sinner is made up, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.1.

<P>AGAIN, <HI>Their Sins are Forgiven,</HI> and they are made <HI>righteous</HI> before God, thro' the <HI>im|putation of the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t</HI> unto them by <HI>Faith,</HI> Rom. 8.12. That va&s;t debt which they owed, is cancelled: God hath received full &s;atisfaction for it, in their Surety, and doth upon believing freely, fully and for ever di&s;charge them from it.

<P>AND <HI>Further</HI> hereupon their <HI>Per&s;ons</HI> and <HI>Services</HI> are <HI>accepted,</HI> Eph. 1.6. Their hearts are <HI>&s;anctified,</HI> and they are graciou&s;ly renew|ed and re&s;tored to &s;ome conformity to the <HI>Divine Image and Likene&s;s,</HI> 2 Pet. 1.4.

<P>THEY have al&s;o <HI>Liberty of Acce&s;s to the Throne of Grace,</HI> and encouragement to expect that they &s;hall <HI>obtain mercy and find grace to help in all times of need,</HI> Eph. 2.18.

And this is &s;o <HI>rich</HI> and <HI>great,</HI> &s;o full and compleat as will exceed all their de&s;ires and expectations; nothing &s;hall be wanting to their &s;atisfaction and felicity.

have been done for his Salvation. It was the Soul e&s;pecially that was &s;tained and cor|rupted with &s;in, that needed to be re&s;tored by &s;anctifying Grace; it was the Soul that was fir&s;tly &s;ubject to the impre&s;&s;ions of di|vine Wrath, and that can have the deepe&s;t &s;en&s;e of it. It is the <HI>Soul</HI> that is capable to know, love, fear, glorify and enjoy God, and it was the tender compa&s;&s;ions of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t working towards our pre|cious but peri&s;hing <HI>Souls</HI> which (next to the Glory of his Father) mov'd him to do what he hath done for the Salvation of them.

There's no de&s;ign that Men have to carry on, no bu&s;ine&s;s that they have to do, of e|qual weight with this: and which de&s;erves &s;uch regard from them.

that he &s;hould expre&s;s his regards in the lowe&s;t in&s;tances of it. So holy <HI>Ja|cob</HI> thought, <HI>Gen.</HI> 32.10. But it is much more to be admired, that he &s;hould employ his Wi&s;dom in &s;uch a wonderful contrivance as that of our Redemption: give his <HI>Son</HI> to a&s;|&s;ume our nature, to obey and &s;uffer and die, that he might redeem and &s;ave us, &s;end forth his Almighty <HI>Spirit,</HI> to make applica|tion of that Redemption notwith&s;tanding the rebellion and reluctancy of our hearts again&s;t it: and it &s;hould the more endear it to us, con&s;idering that as great and wonder|ful as it is, it was no more then we had ab|&s;olute need of, and had been for ever lo&s;t and undone, if infinite Wi&s;dom, Love and Grace had not been in this way concerned for us.

<P N="1">1. THIS is <HI>one &s;pecial way of putting honour upon God for it,</HI> to entertain high and ho|nourable thoughts of it.

Did the ble&s;&s;ed God de&s;ign to glorify him&s;elf in this work, to give occa&s;ion to Men and An|gels to do it? How unworthy a thing will it be if we don't fall in with this great de|&s;ign?

If we don't often view with wonder and prai&s;e the glory of his Grace and Love in the In|carnation

Yet this was but a tem|poral Mercy, and a <HI>&s;hadow</HI> of this glorious Work: therefore not to admire God in this will be the blacke&s;t ingratitude. What greater thing can be &s;uppos'd that God &s;hould ever do to endear him&s;elf to us, and engage the highe&s;t e&s;teem of him, and rea|dine&s;s to put honour upon him, then he hath done in this a&s;toni&s;hing work?</P>

and of the ways and means whereby deli|verance hath been brought about. 1 Pet. 2.7. <HI>Unto you that believe he is precious.</HI> The Pro|po&s;ition is convertible: They to whom Chri&s;t is precious do believe: a high valuation of Chri&s;t in his Per&s;on, Offices, Benefits, is ever a concomitant of Faith, and evidential of it. They who have been led into the &s;piritual under&s;tanding of the Glory of the Per&s;on of Chri&s;t, the acceptablene&s;s of his Obedience, the &s;ufficiency of his Satisfaction, the glory of divine Wi&s;dom, in the contrivance and carrying on the work of our Redemption, will and do undoubtedly clo&s;e with it, and actually depend upon this glorious Saviour.

take a great deal of pains for a few Years comfort.

<P>THE <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> evidently intimates this by the <HI>&s;uppo&s;al</HI> that he makes of the fearful hazard that will be con&s;equent upon it.

This is a di&s;mal proof of the deplorable &s;tate of Man by the Fall, which hath not only brought guilt and wrath upon him, but a fearful blindne&s;s and ob&s;tinacy; a mo&s;t wretched aver&s;ion from God; that though he is peri&s;hing for want of Salvation, yet when it is brought him, and mo&s;t graciou&s;ly tendred, he hath not a heart to accept it and clo&s;e with the offer of it. This gave occa&s;ion to tho&s;e <HI>complaints</HI> of our <HI>Saviour,</HI> Mat. 23.37. <HI>How often would I have gathered you, and ye would not.</HI> Joh. 5.40. Life was to be

had by Chri&s;t but they cared not for it, would not come to Chri&s;t for it: it is too much the &s;pirit of Men &s;till. Salvation is provided by Chri&s;t, revealed in the Go&s;pel, offered to Men in the <HI>Mini&s;try,</HI> urged upon them by the <HI>motions of the Holy Spirit,</HI> and the voice of their own <HI>Con&s;ciences.</HI> But yet there are abundance who are nothing the better for it, who obtain no peace or par|don, no grace or comfort by it.

<P N="1">1. IT you have received and accepted the
<PB N="139" REF="001939_0148_0FBA245159C292F0">
Grace offered in the Go&s;pel, <HI>you do indeed value the priviledges of it.</HI> Both <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> him|&s;elf and the <HI>Benefits</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> are precious to Believers. The priviledges of Salvation are various, and &s;ome of them &s;ome carnal Per&s;ons may &s;eem to e&s;teem. But to value them all, or indeed rightly to value any, is one <HI>di&s;tingui&s;hing character</HI> of true Believers. <HI>Peace with God</HI> is one of the priviledges of the Go&s;pel. Carnal Men would be glad that God would not hurt them, but as for any real e&s;teem of his <HI>Favour,</HI> or rejoycing in his Friend&s;hip, prizing his Pre&s;ence or Fellow|&s;hip with him, this they are &s;trangers to: but a gracious Soul values this, and accor|dingly prefers the favour of God above the <HI>increa&s;es of Corn and Wine,</HI> P&s;al. 4.5, 6, 7. Yea accounts his <HI>loving kindne&s;s to be better than Life,</HI> P&s;al. 63.2. The friend&s;hip of God is more to them then the &s;miles of all the World. The &s;en&s;e they have of the excellen|cy of it is the great inducement to a holy walking before God, and watchfulne&s;s a|gain&s;t any thing that may make a breach between God and them, and provoke him to hide his Face from them. Again, <HI>Liberty of Acce&s;s to God,</HI> as to a <HI>Father in Chri&s;t,</HI> that they may come and pour out their hearts un|to him in all their &s;traits and nece&s;&s;ities, this is a priviledge which gracious Souls have
<PB N="140" REF="001939_0149_0FBA2457DB8AEB28">
an high e&s;teem of, and do thankfully im|prove. Hence their approaches to God are not the effects of &s;lavi&s;h fear, but of love, they come not into God's pre&s;ence as forc'd and con&s;train'd, but as delighting in it, that they may expre&s;s a &s;en&s;e of his Grace to|wards them, and may obtain further mani|fe&s;tations and experiences of it. Again, <HI>Another Priviledge</HI> that Believers have by Chri&s;t and which they are wont highly to value is, <HI>Deliverance from the reigning power and dominion of &s;in.</HI> Rom. 6.14. This is a principal part of that Liberty which they enjoy by Chri&s;t at pre&s;ent, that by his <HI>Spirit</HI> he enables them <HI>to mortify the deeds of the bo|dy,</HI> Rom. 8.13. They are made partakers of a new nature by the Spirit of Chri&s;t ef|fectually working in them, which inclines them not only to avoid and re&s;i&s;t, but to hate &s;in, and to love and prize holine&s;s. And as they are improving the con&s;ideration of the <HI>Death</HI> of Chri&s;t and his de&s;ign in Re|demption as arguments to engage their hearts again&s;t it; &s;o they have recour&s;e to the <HI>Spirit of Chri&s;t</HI> for direction and help in the cour&s;e of their duty, and for a&s;&s;i&s;tance in their conflicts and temptations: and it is their comfort that the Salvation which is <HI>be|gun</HI> in them in this re&s;pect &s;hall in due time be <HI>perfected</HI>; glad would they be of the <HI>per|fection

And to add no more un|der this Head; It will be a <HI>dreadful aggra|vation</HI> of the mi&s;ery of &s;uch to remember in how <HI>fair a way</HI> they once were for Salvati|on, how <HI>near</HI> to the <HI>Kingdom of Heaven</HI>; and for what ba&s;e and mean things they forfeited it: for what trifles they ca&s;t away their <HI>Souls</HI>; and then Sinners will confe&s;s that the <HI>Scripture</HI> doth not mi&s;call them, when it terms them <HI>Fools.</HI> They will fa&s;t enough load them&s;elves with the opprobrious name, that <HI>they had a price in their hands to have got wi&s;dom, but not a heart to improve it,</HI> Prov. 17.16.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>WHENCE is it that the neglect of the Great Salvation of the Go&s;pel &s;hall have &s;uch a fearful I&s;&s;ue,</HI> Or, <HI>That the Mi&s;ery of &s;uch Sinners will be &s;o terrible and unavoidable?</HI></P>
<P>Two or Three Things may evidence it.</P>
<P N="1">1. BECAUSE <HI>it is an abu&s;e of the greate&s;t Love and Mercy that God ever manife&s;ted to the World.</HI> The Scripture &s;peaks of the love of God in the Gift of Chri&s;t as tran&s;cendent and &s;uperlative, <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.16. 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 4.10. God &s;hews great Mercy to Man in giving them Food and Cloathing, and other ne|ce&s;&s;aries

and comforts of Life. But Infinite love &s;hines forth in the Gift of Chri&s;t. God had nothing greater and better to give to the World, than his <HI>Own Son,</HI> an <HI>Only Son,</HI> mo&s;t <HI>Dear</HI> to him, One in whom he took the highe&s;t plea&s;ure and &s;atisfaction; A <HI>Son</HI> that was the <HI>brightne&s;s of his Glory,</HI> and <HI>the expre&s;s Image of his Per&s;on.</HI> To give him to endure &s;uch Sufferings, to &s;ubmit to &s;uch a &s;tate of Humiliation and Aba&s;ement as he was pleas'd to do. For our &s;akes to bear the <HI>Cur&s;e</HI> that we might have the <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing</HI>! to be made <HI>Sin</HI> that we might partake of his <HI>Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s</HI>! to <HI>Die</HI> that we might <HI>Live! for us</HI> that could never profit him, nor recom|pence him! to make a free offer of this Sal|vation, yea to repeat the offer, it may be <HI>Hundreds</HI> of <HI>Thou&s;ands</HI> of Times to Sinners! and yet all this while to have this Glorious Saviour contemned, this Great Salvation trampled upon, and &s;lighted, as if every triflle, vanity or lu&s;t were more de&s;irable, this mu&s;t needs provoke the heavie&s;t Wrath. If Men know not the worth and glory of a Saviour, how to &s;et a value upon the won|derful wi&s;dom, grace and love of God that hath appeared in the way of Salvation by him, and the ble&s;&s;ed priviledges of it; yet &s;urely God knows the worth of the&s;e things, and how to adjudge a proportionable puni&s;h|ment
<PB N="159" REF="001939_0168_0FBA2492E020FDA8">
for it. And what &s;ufferings of Sin|ners can bear a proportion to an indignity ca&s;t upon &s;o Glorious a Per&s;on? God hath &s;ometimes &s;everely animadverted upon tho&s;e that have de&s;pi&s;ed his <HI>Servants</HI>: and much more may it be expected that he will be &s;evere upon tho&s;e that <HI>don't reverence his Son.</HI> However ignorant and carele&s;s Sinners make light of this contempt of the Lord Je|&s;us Chri&s;t: the <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> of God in inflicting de&s;erved Vengeance for it will appear <HI>Glo|rious</HI> in the Eyes of Angels and Saints.</P>
<P N="2">2. BECAUSE <HI>&s;uch are guilty of refu&s;ing the only Remedy.</HI> This is the la&s;t and only re|fuge or means of relief that God hath pro|vided for Man's re&s;toration to his Image and Favour &s;ince his Apo&s;tacy from God. We read, Rom. 8.3, 4. <HI>For what the law could not do in that it was weak through the fle&s;h, God &s;ending his own Son in the likene&s;s of &s;inful fle&s;h, and for &s;in condemned &s;in in the fle&s;h, that the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the law might be fulfilled in us.</HI> When <HI>Adam</HI> the &s;pon&s;or and &s;urety of the <HI>Fir&s;t Covenant,</HI> fail'd of obtaining Life, and Men through the lo&s;s of the Divine I|mage were &s;o weakened and di&s;abled, that they could not an&s;wer their obligation to it, God was plea&s;ed to &s;ub&s;titute the <HI>Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> to procure Pardon and Life by a <HI>New

Covenant.</HI> But in ca&s;e this way of Salvation by Je&s;us Chri&s;t be rejected and &s;lighted, God hath made no provi&s;ion of <HI>Another.</HI> God hath laid out the trea&s;ures of his Wi&s;dom and Love in providing of this way. Grace and Mercy towards Sinners have been glo|rified in as high a degree as we can &s;uppo&s;e it po&s;&s;ible that they &s;hould. God hath <HI>no other Son</HI> to give to die in the Sinners &s;tead, there was a nece&s;&s;ity of Death to &s;atisfy for trangre&s;&s;ions again&s;t the Law. <HI>Without &s;hed|ding <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f blood, there was no remi&s;&s;ion.</HI> Rivers of <HI>Blood of Bea&s;ts,</HI> that by Divine Appointment were &s;hed before the great <HI>Sacrifice</HI> of Chri&s;t was offered, were in&s;ufficient to expiate &s;in. How then can it be thought that &s;atisfaction &s;hould be made by any meer Creature, when the guilt ri&s;es higher by &s;ins both again&s;t the <HI>Law</HI> and <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> too? What can ever ex|piate for contempt ca&s;t upon the Blood of the Son of God? Sinners again&s;t the Go&s;|pel mu&s;t be left quite hopele&s;s. God hath provided no remedy, nor is it in their own power to provide any. Therefore their de&s;truction is certain and <HI>unavoidable.</HI> Nor will the Rivers of Tears &s;hed by condemned Sinners in Hell ever be able to quench the flames of it.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE certainty of it is evident becau&s;e <HI>the Ju&s;tice and Truth of God requires it.</HI> The
<PB N="161" REF="001939_0170_0FBA249A469CE2E8">
Ble&s;&s;ed God hath re&s;olv'd upon it, that he will glorify his Son. The <HI>Word is gone out of his mouth in righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> and &s;hall not be rever&s;ed, <HI>that every knee &s;hall bow to him.</HI> The whole World &s;hall be the triumphs of his <HI>Grace</HI> or <HI>Ju&s;tice.</HI> The <HI>Scripture</HI> contains abundance of terrible comminations again&s;t unbelievers. It tells us, they <HI>&s;hall be damned,</HI> that they &s;hall <HI>never &s;ee Life,</HI> that the <HI>Wrath of God abides on them,</HI> &amp;c. Now the&s;e threat|nings proceed from a God of invariable <HI>Truth,</HI> un&s;potted <HI>Ju&s;tice,</HI> and Almighty <HI>Power,</HI> and will &s;urely be accompli&s;h'd. There is many times a <HI>&s;ecret hope</HI> nouri&s;hed in the hearts of Sinners that God will not be &s;o &s;trict and &s;evere as to execute his threatnings upon them, or if he doth, he will not do it in &s;o terrible a manner, as he hath threatned. But the&s;e hopes are pre|&s;umptuous and ungrounded. God hath left no foundation for Sinners to build them upon. His threatnings are no ra&s;h and &s;ud|den determinations as Mens often are; but are a &s;anction of the Go&s;pel Covenant, which God in his Eternal Wi&s;dom and Coun&s;el hath determined and e&s;tabli&s;hed, therefore will not recede or go back from them. God is unalterably ju&s;t and true in his <HI>Threatnings</HI> as well as in his <HI>Promi&s;es. He is not a man that he &s;hould lie, or the &s;on of man
<PB N="162" REF="001939_0171_0FBA24A043156DC0">
that he &s;hould repent,</HI> Jam. 1.15. There's no expectation that God will alter his mind, or that he can ever want <HI>Power</HI> to execute his threatnings. Be&s;ides the <HI>Sufferings of Chri&s;t</HI> are a convincing proof of the Truth of them. God &s;par'd him not when &s;in was imputed to him: there was a nece&s;&s;ity that he &s;hould drink the bitter Cup of Divine Wrath, that the Ju&s;tice and Truth of God might be glorified. And if Ju&s;tice would not &s;pare the Son of God neither will it &s;pare guilty Sinners. <HI>If the&s;e things were done in the green tree, what &s;hall be done in the dry?</HI></P>
<P>THESE Things may be &s;ufficient to con|firm the Truth before us, That the de|&s;truction of &s;uch as neglect the Salvation offered in the Go&s;pel will be <HI>Certain</HI> and Unavoidable.</P>
<P><HI>USE I.</HI> THIS Truth may evidence the <HI>fearful blindne&s;s and &s;otti&s;hne&s;s that many Sinners are under, who neglect the Salvation ten|dered to them by Je&s;us Chri&s;t in the Go&s;pel.</HI> It is evident from hence, becau&s;e there will be <HI>no po&s;&s;ibility of e&s;caping God's &s;ore&s;t Wrath and Vengeance</HI> if this Salvation be neglected. This way of Salvation which the Go&s;pel pro|pounds by Je&s;us Chri&s;t is &s;o &s;uitable to the &s;tate of fallen Man, &s;o accommodated to
<PB N="163" REF="001939_0172_0FBA24A1A22E7148">
an&s;wer all his nece&s;&s;ities; to relieve him un|der all his wants and fears; &s;o &s;afe a way, and a way wherein &s;o much of the Grace, Love and Wi&s;dom of God hath appeared, that its own excellency and beneficialne&s;s may ju&s;tly recommend it to all to whom the offer of it is made; but when, together with this, there is &s;uch an unavoidable certainty of mi&s;ery unto all them that neglect it, one might ju&s;tly expect that every Man &s;hould be mo&s;t deeply concern'd to &s;ecure an in|tere&s;t in it, and u&s;e utmo&s;t diligence to make it his own. But alas! How much doth a contrary &s;pirit appear! What carele&s;sne&s;s, &s;lightne&s;s and indifferency do abundance manife&s;t in this matter? As if it were a thing of little weight or worth, that they might do well enough in the neglect of. The <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> a&s;&s;igns the true rea&s;on hereof, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.3, 4. Were not Men under fearful <HI>blind|ne&s;s</HI> and <HI>&s;trong delu&s;ions</HI> from the <HI>god of this World,</HI> it could not be that they &s;hould thus neglect their own Mercies. This may be further manife&s;ted,</P>
<P N="1">1. IN that <HI>they act &s;o contrary to what they profe&s;s to be their Intere&s;t.</HI> It is a thing which Men generally, if not univer&s;ally, acknow|ledge to be nece&s;&s;ary to take care of the Salvation of their Souls, and provide for a future happine&s;s; that if Chri&s;t be not their

Surety and Saviour, they are mi&s;erable: that the life and &s;afety of their Souls depends upon their Faith in Chri&s;t, and Repentance towards God, but yet they act as if they loved Death, and could be contented to venture Damnation. Tho' a Saviour be offered them, yet they neglect or defer clo|&s;ing with him. Were they not under a &s;trange infatuation blinded with the love of Sin, or the love of the World, it could not be that they &s;hould leave their Souls at this hazard, and run &s;uch a venture of peri&s;hing for ever: e&s;pecially when they know their opportunities are continually pa&s;&s;ing from them, and they know not how &s;oon God may put a period to them.</P>
<P N="2">2. IN that this is the only way wherein there is any hopes of obtaining Salvation. If this way ben't clo&s;ed with there is no hope of relief by any other. The Word of God a&s;&s;ures us that as there is One God, &s;o there is <HI>One Mediator between God and Men,</HI> and there is but <HI>One.</HI> Fooli&s;h Men have multiplied mediators as well as gods; but God never appointed but One. And it is thro' him alone that Salvation is attainable, Act. 4.12. <HI>Neither is there Salvation in any o|ther for there is no other name given among men whereby we mu&s;t be &s;aved.</HI> God never &s;av'd any of the Children of Men upon any other

account, and there's no room to expect he ever will. It mu&s;t be owned that Heaven is the Lord's, and he may give it to whom he will; and upon what terms he will. But our Saviour tells us, <HI>Joh.</HI> 14.6. That he is <HI>the way the truth and life, that no man comes to the father but by him.</HI> You mu&s;t take this way or peri&s;h for ever. They who will not have Heaven upon Chri&s;t's terms mu&s;t go with|out it. Now when the ca&s;e is thus, it mu&s;t be a mo&s;t &s;trange infatuation and delu&s;ion they are under who neglect it.</P>
<P N="3">3. IN that <HI>God hath given as clear and evi|dent proofs of the certainty of this way of Salva|tion as can in rea&s;on be de&s;ired, and of his wil|lingne&s;s to be&s;tow it upon the terms propounded in the Go&s;pel.</HI> So that they can't pretend a want of &s;ufficient Warrant for encourage|ment to believe. God in his Word plainly di&s;covers to Men what their &s;inful helple&s;s and undone condition is; and how impo&s;&s;i|ble it is to them to get righteou&s;ne&s;s and life by the Law. He hath al&s;o plainly di&s;|covered the &s;ufficiency and acceptablene&s;s of the &s;atisfaction that Chri&s;t hath made: that he is well plea&s;ed in him: that it was a way of his own contriving; that he <HI>&s;anctified him, and &s;ent him into the World,</HI> Joh. 10.36. That <HI>the blood of Chri&s;t clean&s;es from all &s;in,</HI> Joh. 1.7. His Satisfaction was fully commen&s;urate to
<PB N="166" REF="001939_0175_0FBA24AC2FDA4650">
the demands of the Law and Ju&s;tice of God. Believers have the &s;ure Word and <HI>Promi&s;e</HI> of God to depend upon in this matter, yea he hath confirmed it by his <HI>Oath,</HI> to this end (as the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> a&s;&s;ures in, <HI>Heb.</HI> 6.17, 18.) That the <HI>Heirs of Promi&s;e might have &s;trong Con&s;olation.</HI> God formerly confirmed his Word by miraculous works, and &s;till con|firms it by many &s;upernatural effects: in a|wakening, quieting and comforting the Con&s;ciences of Sinners; filling them with <HI>Joy un&s;peakable:</HI> and &s;anctifying their hearts; which are a kind of Inchoation of Glory. Now after the truth of the Go&s;pel hath been &s;o fully confirmed, and is &s;o generally ac|knowledged; for Men to be carele&s;s about the Salvation that it offers; doth &s;urely flow from the blinding hardening power of &s;in, and the delu&s;ions impos'd upon them by the great Adver&s;ary of their Souls.</P>
<P><HI>USE II.</HI> TO <HI>Awaken and Reprove &s;uch Per&s;ons as neglect the Great Salvation.</HI> I in|tend here all &s;uch as are not &s;eriou&s;ly and deeply concerned to have their hearts brought to a full compliance with the terms upon which it is offered; to abandon their &s;inful ways, to renounce a dependance upon their own righteou&s;ne&s;s, and to commit their Souls in a way of believing unto the
<PB N="167" REF="001939_0176_0FBA24AD07CF2540">
Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as the Go&s;pel requires: but &s;pend their days in &s;ecurity, in carnal and &s;en&s;ual delights, in an eager pro&s;ecution of the profits of the World, or that in the pride of their hearts are &s;eeking to e&s;tabli&s;h a righteou&s;ne&s;s <HI>as it were by the works of the Law</HI>; and &s;pend their days in &s;inful di&s;pon|dency, and vain and fruitle&s;s cavils again&s;t the duty of believing in Chri&s;t, which the Go&s;pel urges unto. I &s;hall mention a few things here, to promote the Awakening and Conviction of &s;uch Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider, 1. <HI>HOW great contempt of the Grace and Mercy and Conde&s;cention of God you are guilty of, by neglecting Chri&s;t and the Salva|tion he offers to you.</HI> The offers of Salvation that are made to &s;inners are fruits of free and unde&s;erved Grace. God had no need of Man's friend&s;hip or &s;ervice, had ju&s;t ad|vantage by the Law again&s;t him to have glorified him&s;elf in the executions of his Ju&s;tice upon him: but notwith&s;tanding was pleas'd in &s;overeign Mercy to provide and reveal a way of Salvation, wherein he would di&s;cover his own Perfections, and provide for the happine&s;s of Man. And as the <HI>A|po&s;tle</HI> here informs us, hath &s;ent <HI>His Own Son,</HI> to work out this Salvation for us, and to publi&s;h it to us. It is that which <HI>began to be
<PB N="168" REF="001939_0177_0FBA24AE87256050">
&s;poken to us by the Lord.</HI> The ever ble&s;&s;ed Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t was willing to come him|&s;elf from the bo&s;om of his Father to pur|cha&s;e and publi&s;h Salvation. Now the greatne&s;s of the Per&s;on &s;ent upon this great errand and de&s;ign carries the greater obli|gation in it to all to accept the offer, and heightens the &s;in in the refu&s;al of it. God was ju&s;tly offended with the <HI>Jews</HI> that they <HI>de&s;pi&s;ed his Servants</HI>; and expected that &s;ure|ly they would <HI>reverence his Son,</HI> when he &s;ent him among them, <HI>Mat.</HI> 21.57. The fuller and clearer the revelations of divine Grace are to Men, the greater a&s;&s;urance God gives of his readine&s;s to accept them, and be&s;tow Salvation in this way, there is the greater contempt in neglect and refu&s;al of it. The not hearkening to the <HI>Law of God delivered by Angels at Mount Sinai,</HI> was a contempt of God's Authority, and <HI>received a ju&s;t recom|pence of reward</HI>; As the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> tells us in the <HI>Ver&s;e</HI> before our <HI>Text.</HI> But it is a much greater contempt to di&s;obey the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> which was <HI>Preached by Chri&s;t</HI> him&s;elf. In the one God is de&s;pi&s;ed, &s;peaking by his Servants, in the other by his <HI>Son.</HI> There hath been a great deal of contempt ca&s;t upon God by Sinners in all Ages, they under-value his goodne&s;s, &s;light his threatnings, trample up|on his authority, walk contrary to his com|mands:
<PB N="169" REF="001939_0178_0FBA24B6A9488EC8">
which gave occa&s;ion to that of the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t, P&s;al.</HI> 10.13. <HI>Wherefore d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th the wick|ed contemn God</HI>! It is an unrea&s;onable and injurious thing that they &s;hould do &s;o; but in this ca&s;e the contempt ri&s;es higher, be|cau&s;e not only his Authority is contemned which requires Men to obey the Go&s;pel, but his Grace and Love in the highe&s;t di&s;co|veries of them are &s;lighted and undervalued, as though the rich offers that he makes, were not worthy of your &s;erious regards, did not de&s;erve your thoughts, or the employing your time about. <HI>Do ye thus requite the Lord?</HI> Doth the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us de&s;erve no better re|quital for all the Te&s;timonies he hath given of his tender concern for you?</P>
<P>Con&s;ider, 2. <HI>THE inexpre&s;&s;ible wrong you do to your own Souls.</HI> Nature teaches Men to love them&s;elves, to &s;eek their own good, and e&s;pecially requires a due concern for the be&s;t part of them&s;elves, their Souls. The&s;e being of greater excellency and worth then their Bodies, de&s;erve the highe&s;t regards from them. But they that neglect a Saviour di&s;regard and undervalue their own Souls, interpretatively <HI>they love Death.</HI> They bring the mo&s;t certain and inexpre&s;&s;ible mi&s;ery upon their own Souls. They cut them&s;elves off from any hope of acceptance with God,
<PB N="170" REF="001939_0179_0FBA24B90A38D240">
and any title to a ble&s;&s;ed Immortality, and bring upon them&s;elves certain and unavoida|ble mi&s;ery: yea at pre&s;ent they do un|&s;peakable wrong to their own Souls, in de|priving them of all true <HI>comfort.</HI> They can have no pardon of Sin, no peace with God, no hope in the Promi&s;es, no priviledge of acce&s;s to him. The&s;e are all obtained by Chri&s;t, and communicated only for his &s;ake and upon his account to Believers; and they deprive them al&s;o of that which is their <HI>Beauty,</HI> their <HI>Honour,</HI> their <HI>Life</HI>; even that <HI>Holine&s;s</HI> and Sanctification which is a main part of the Salvation which Chri&s;t invites Sinners to come to him for. A Soul de&s;ti|tute of holine&s;s is a loath&s;om vile thing in the Eyes of God. 'Tis fit to do him no &s;er|vice, to perform no acceptable duty, to ex|ert no act of Grace: is en&s;laved to its own lu&s;ts; hurried by its irregular pa&s;&s;ions; a ready in&s;trument of Satan to &s;erve his de|&s;igns; is often hurried as that mi&s;erable <HI>Demoniack,</HI> Mark 5.5. <HI>To cut and wound and tear him&s;elf.</HI> Is pulling down many &s;piritual Judgments upon him&s;elf. If Chri&s;t ben't accepted as a Saviour to you, you have none of the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings from him: the &s;pirit of holine&s;s is his peculiar purcha&s;e and gift. <HI>He &s;aves his people from their Sins.</HI> He enligh|tens their minds, renews their wills, purifies
<PB N="171" REF="001939_0180_0FBA24BA9CD637A8">
hearts, conveys and cheri&s;hes all &s;piritual life in them. Now can you be content to be an utter &s;tranger to all true holine&s;s? To live under the tyranny of Satan, and reign of Sin? To have a Soul utterly un&s;ervicea|ble to God while you live, and unfit and unworthy of any fellow&s;hip with God when you mu&s;t die? Now thus it mu&s;t be if the gracious offers that Chri&s;t makes be rejected and &s;lighted. How unworthy the name of a <HI>Man</HI> is he that &s;uffers a Soul to be thus neg|lected and ruined?</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>YOU oppo&s;e, and as much as in you lies, fru&s;trate one main de&s;ign that God hath been car|rying on from the beginning of the World.</HI> The work of <HI>Redemption</HI> is one of the great and mo&s;t glorious Works of God which hath been upon his Heart before the foundations of the World; and whereby he de&s;igned to rai&s;e Eternal honour and glory to him&s;elf, and to bring about the greate&s;t good to his Elect. Now the means of effecting this, is by bringing Men to, <HI>Repentance and Faith</HI> in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; &s;ubmitting to the terms of the Go&s;pel. This is that which God calls Men to, when he brings his Go&s;pel to any place. The great duty he urges Men unto is not to receive the Grace of God in vain. Now it is in vain if his end be not
<PB N="172" REF="001939_0181_0FBA24BD51EFEB40">
attained; if Men neglect the duty enjoyned in order to God's Glory, and their own good. Now when Men act contrary to the end of God, it may be rea&s;onably concluded that it is very offen&s;ive to him; as on the other hand it is plea&s;ing to him when his end is attained. Hence we read, that our Saviour <HI>rejoyced in Spirit,</HI> upon the report that the <HI>Di&s;ciples</HI> brought him of the <HI>&s;ucce&s;s of their Mini&s;try,</HI> Luk. 10.21.

Life. How &s;tinging will be the reproaches of Con&s;cience for it? To enforce this matter,</P>
<P>Con&s;i. 1. <HI>THE greatne&s;s of this &s;in of Unbe|lief,</HI> in rejecting Chri&s;t and the Salvation that he offers. It is not without cau&s;e that God hath &s;o often fixed <HI>Damnation</HI> to it, and &s;o plainly threatned the ruine of tho&s;e that continue in it. Too often this &s;in is look'd upon as a &s;mall matter, as if it were their <HI>mi&s;ery</HI> rather than their <HI>&s;in</HI> that it is <HI>not in their power to believe</HI> without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Spirit of God. Yea &s;ome that &s;tartle at other &s;ins, don't tremble at this; but this is a &s;in that is very &s;inful, and many ways aggravated in the &s;ight of God. This may appear in that this &s;in flows from the wickedne&s;s of Men's hearts, as all other &s;ins do: it flows from the blindne&s;s of Men's minds, and the many unworthy thoughts of God that they are ready to entertain. They doubt of his Wi&s;dom, his Holine&s;s &amp; Truth. They are more ready to lay weight upon the word of a Man, than upon the Word of God. Unbelief reflects upon the Truth and Faithfulne&s;s of God. Hence it is &s;aid, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 5.10. <HI>He that believeth not God hath made him a liar.</HI> How fearful a thing is it, to re|proach the God of truth, and One that can|not lie? It di&s;parages and virtually denies

It is a &s;in that is rooted in the pride, perver&s;ene&s;s and ob&s;tinacy of Men<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s hearts. Hence Chri&s;t &s;aith to them, Joh. 5.40. <HI>Ye will not come to me that ye may have life.</HI> 'Tis a &s;in that is committed a|gain&s;t more Grace, Mercy and Love then many other &s;ins are. Hence it is &s;aid to be in a peculiar manner the damning &s;in, the &s;in that binds the guilt of all other &s;ins upon the Soul, and cuts it off from the la&s;t and only remedy. It is a &s;in of a very heinous and horrible nature; therefore ju&s;tly to be dreaded and deprecated.</P>
<P>Con&s;i. 2. <HI>WHAT Mi&s;ery this &s;in of neg|lecting the Great Salvation offered by Chri&s;t hath brought upon others.</HI> If we only look into the &s;tate of the <HI>Jews,</HI> their example is very in|&s;tructive and awakening. The <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> tells us, Rom. 11.20. That <HI>for unbelief they were broken off.</HI> Their &s;in was exceeding great in <HI>Crucifying the Prince of Life.</HI> But it plea&s;ed God to make them the offer of the Salvation that was purcha&s;ed by that precious Blood
<PB N="178" REF="001939_0187_0FBA24D330F829D0">
afterward, and had they accepted the offer, it had been effectual to have expiated that crying &s;in. But for their Unbelief God re|jected them. They were once a People <HI>highly favoured by God</HI>; there was no People in the World for many Generations &s;o pe|culiarly priviledg'd by God as they were, (as were ea&s;y to &s;hew in many in&s;tances) But now as the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> tells us, <HI>Wrath is come upon them to the uttermo&s;t,</HI> 1 The&s;. 2.16. None of their priviledges could &s;ecure them from an a&s;toni&s;hing de&s;olation. <HI>Hi&s;torians</HI> ob|&s;erve this as remarkable in their de&s;olation, that God pick<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d out one of the mo&s;t <HI>merci|ful Emperors</HI> that ever &s;way'd the <HI>Roman Scepter,</HI> to be the In&s;trument of it, that their de&s;truction might appear to be from the Hand of Heaven, rather than from the cruel|ty of Man.

<P>Con&s;i. 3. <HI>HOW uncapable you are to perform any act of duty to God, or to find acceptance with God in any &s;ervice you perform, 'till you are in|tere&s;ted in this Salvation by Faith in Chri&s;t, and a &s;aving Conver&s;ion to God.</HI> It is only in the Name and upon the account of Chri&s;t that our Per&s;ons and &s;ervices come to be of any account with God.

The <HI>Covenant of Works</HI> accepts of no obedience but that of a holy Per&s;on, and free from all imperfection. And you have no claim by the <HI>Covenant of Grace,</HI> 'till the terms of it are con&s;ented to.

God takes no plea&s;ure in them, they will not be rewarded or crowned by God at la&s;t. Yea, if you are de&s;titute of a principle of Faith and Love to God, they are all done for &s;ome corrupt end or other, are not a &s;ervice to God, but to &s;ome Lu&s;t.

<P N="4">4. <HI>THINK how uncertain your opportunity of obtaining the Salvation that the Go&s;pel offers may be.</HI> God hath been a long time ten|dring the Ble&s;&s;ings of the Go&s;pel to you; but he hath &s;et bounds to his Patience how long it &s;hall be exerci&s;ed; not only towards Men in <HI>general,</HI> but towards <HI>particular Per&s;ons.</HI> And you know not what bounds God hath &s;et to it, when you &s;hall come to the period of it.

And e&s;pecially may this quiet your hearts in the expectation of it, that Heaven it&s;elf, as great and as rich an Inheritance as it is, is not a greater Gift then Chri&s;t is: And if God had love enough to his People to <HI>give his Son,</HI> he don<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t want love to give <HI>Heaven.</HI> You may conclude with the Apo&s;tle, Rom, Rom. 8.32. <HI>He

<P N="2">2.

He is a <HI>King and Lawgiver</HI> as well as <HI>Saviour</HI> to his Peo|ple. 'Tis his aim to make them holy as well as happy. Indeed this ought de&s;erved|ly to be look'd upon as <HI>a main part of our hap|pine&s;s,</HI> as well as the way leading to it. And there is no &s;incere choice of Chri&s;t, and &s;ub|jection to him, where he is not received as a King as well as Saviour. It is an abu&s;e of the Grace of Chri&s;t manife&s;ted in the Go&s;|pel, when Per&s;ons pre&s;ume upon inpunity, while they allow them&s;elves in &s;in. Chri&s;t by <HI>&s;uffering for &s;in</HI> hath given us the cleare&s;t repre&s;entation of the evil nature of &s;in, and its extream offen&s;ivene&s;s to God. By the ho|line&s;s

of his Life he hath given us the mo&s;t ex|cellent <HI>pattern</HI> of Obedience: and by the purity of his Laws, hath given us the mo&s;t perfect <HI>rule</HI> of Obedience. All which things clearly &s;hew, it is what he expects from all his People. The honour of God, their ho|nourable Relation to him, their hopes from him, and the experiences of his Grace to|wards them, there own comfort in the ex|pectation of the ble&s;&s;ings he hath promi&s;ed them, are all Motives to &s;uch a Conver&s;a|tion. The great duty of the Go&s;pel is <HI>Love.</HI> Now Love to Chri&s;t is e&s;pecially to be ex|pre&s;s'd by <HI>Obedience</HI>; as in that Precept of Chri&s;t, Joh. 14.15. <HI>If ye love me keep my Commandments.</HI> And that this is the mo&s;t clear and genuine fruit of Love, Chri&s;t fur|ther declares, in <HI>ver.</HI> 21.23, 4. Gods Love to us is a Love of <HI>beneficence,</HI> but our love to him is a love of <HI>reverence</HI> and <HI>obedience,</HI> a love to plea&s;e and honour him. 1 Joh. 5.3. <HI>This is the love of God that we keep his Com|mandments. And his Commandments are not grievous.</HI> Now if you ask what Obedience is required, this may be be&s;t an&s;wered by a reference to &s;ome comprehen&s;ive <HI>Places of Scripture,</HI> where you may find it in <HI>God's Name,</HI> expre&s;ly enjoyned.
