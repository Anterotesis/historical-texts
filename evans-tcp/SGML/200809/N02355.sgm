<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, faith, <HI>Ma&s;ter,</HI> to be free with you, for what I have &s;een, it does not an&s;wer the Character I had of it; for in&s;tead of a Plain Sincere Well-meaning People, free of all Pride and Luxury, I do not &s;ee but they Pamper, Strut, Back-bite and Sharp upon one another, even far beyond the <HI>Londoners</HI> them|&s;elves.</P>

<P>If it be &s;o <HI>Roger,</HI> Things have been &s;trangely Repre&s;ented to me; for I was told, that the late <HI>William Penn,</HI> or <HI>Sir William Penn,</HI> as &s;ome call him, who was known to be a very Wi&s;e and Generous Hearted Man, had &s;o Projected and Contrived the Foundation and Government of this Colony, that every thing,

both with re&s;pect to Publick and Private Bu&s;|ne&s;s, did gradually and equally move in the Moderate Prudent Way of the <HI>Quaker Oeconomy,</HI> and that, you know, in <HI>England,</HI> has been al|ways agreeable to our antient <HI>Whig Principles,</HI> which (I am &s;orry to &s;ay it) are but little minded now-a-days.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tell you, Ma&s;ter, <HI>William Penn,</HI> or <HI>Sir William Penn,</HI> let him be what you plea&s;e, he has been hugiou&s;ly Mi&s;taken in his Notion of Government; for altho' I agree with you, that our <HI>Engli&s;h Quakers,</HI> in a general way, are a very plain, hone&s;t good People in all their Dealings, and have ever &s;hew'd a &s;trict Re|gard to the Settlement of the Crown in the <HI>Prote&s;tant Line,</HI> which God long pre&s;erve, yet they are Folks, as our Curate us'd to &s;ay, are <HI>Well Skill'd in the Wi&s;dom of this World,</HI> and know <HI>How to &V;&s;e the Mammon of &V;nrighteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> under a Great and Wi&s;e Government that keeps a tight Reign; but here, where &s;ome of them think they have got into the Saddle, Nature &s;eems to work, and they forget from whence they came, or to whom they belong.</P>

<P>If I am not altogether mi&s;-informed, <HI>Roger,</HI> there are men of Sobriety, good Learn|ing and Sen&s;e among&s;t the <HI>Quakers</HI> here, and I am Surprized, that &s;uch men as the&s;e do not take Due Care of the Manners of their People, or at lea&s;t that publick Affairs be Decently managed, and a good Decorum kept.</P>

<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wounds, <HI>Ma&s;ter,</HI> why there's the thing now! for according to the be&s;t of my Infor|mation, &s;ince I have been here, it is the&s;e very &s;ame men of Learning, but not of Right <HI>Engli&s;h Sen&s;e,</HI> that has bred lately a deal of Mi&s;chief among&s;t the People of this Place.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ob&s;erv.</SPEAKER>
<P>How can that be, <HI>Roger</HI>? for it mu&s;t be Univer&s;ally acknowledged, That good Learning is the true&s;t Foundation of all Im|provements what&s;oever; nor indeed can any be made to Purpo&s;e without a Competent &s;hare of Letters.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, in truth, &s;o I have often heard our Curate &s;ay. But then, how do you make this agree with the old Proverb, <HI>That too much Learning makes a Man Mad</HI>?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ob&s;erv.</SPEAKER>
<P>That, perhaps, is not &s;o very dif|ficult as you may Imagine; for if we &s;ay, that &s;uch a One is a man of great Sen&s;e and Learn|ing, it is meant, that he has acquired a &s;ufficient Knowledge in Letters, to make the mo&s;t of that &s;hare of good Natural Under&s;tanding God has given him, and &s;uch Men generally are fitte&s;t to exerci&s;e the fir&s;t Offices in Society &amp; Government, becau&s;e their minds are com|monly bent rather upon a Nece&s;&s;ary and U&s;e|ful Knowledge in Life, than upon that which is meerly Speculative &amp; Scientifical. But when we &s;ay, &s;uch a One is a very &s;tudious Man, and a great Schollar; That he is a great Mathe|matician or Philo&s;opher, and a Compleat Ma|&s;ter

of <HI>Crit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ci&s;m</HI> in all the Languages, then we Conceive the Idea of One fit to be at the head of a Univer&s;ity, but by no means Qualified to govern Mankind in a Civil Society; for if ever &s;uch a One as this was to be put on a Throne, or attempt to Officiate in the Po&s;t of Secretary of State, or the Governour of a Colony, he would In&s;tantly be for Acting the part of a <HI>Roman Emperor</HI> or a <HI>Tacitus,</HI> and would &s;o much de&s;pi&s;e Con&s;titution of Laws made by Men le&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Learn'd than him&s;elf, that the generality of my People now, would mo&s;t certainly con|clude, he was Mad.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roger,</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then <HI>Ma&s;ter,</HI> as &s;ure as you are Alive, that mu&s;t be the very Ca&s;e here; for an hone&s;t Trades-man told me over a Tankard of good Punch, the other Day, that there was a Certain <HI>Quaker</HI> in this place, who had a huge Reputation for being a mighty Schollard; But withal, had an Unruly Itch to be a continually Dabling in Politicks, and medling with other Folks Affairs; Nay, he A&s;&s;ured me, that the &s;ame learn'd <HI>Politician,</HI> had l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ly publi&s;h'd a <HI>Manife&s;to,</HI> declaring, That the Governour of this Place had no right to Speak to the A&s;&s;embly, which Repre&s;ents the People here, ju&s;t as our Hou&s;e of Commons does in <HI>England,</HI> nor to pa&s;s any Bills &s;ent up to the Governour from that Hou&s;e, into Laws,
<PB N="11" REF="002794_0009_0FE63A62A20657A8">
without his Con&s;ent; for, that as he had, with|out all Doubt, more Learning then any body El&s;e, he was therefore the mo&s;t Proper Per&s;on to make Speeches, Frame Laws, and to Inter|pret them after they were made. And further, as my Friend told me, he Claimed by the &s;aid <HI>Manife&s;to</HI> an Indefeazible Right to be <HI>Hereditary</HI> keeper of the Seal of this Government, and treated a worthy hone&s;t Gentleman, the pre|&s;ent Governour, with mo&s;t <HI>Scurrilous Language,</HI> becau&s;e he would not deliver up the Seal into his hands, and go Blindfold into what&s;oever he Propo&s;ed. who can Imagine then, but as you &s;ay, Ma&s;ter, The hone&s;t well meaning People mu&s;t think &s;uch an Extravagant Fellow to be horn-mad; for my part I never heard of the like, except at <HI>Bedlam Ho&s;pital</HI> many Years ago, where <HI>Oliver's Porter</HI> u&s;ed to Rant upon Kings and Government.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ob&s;erv.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Roger,</HI> You tell me &s;trange things indeed; but &s;urely that Trades-man or Friend of yours, be he who he will, mu&s;t have had &s;ome Per&s;onal Pique or Partial Di&s;gu&s;t to the Per&s;on you mean; for I can gue&s;s who you mean, by the Character I received of him in <HI>London;</HI> and, if I am not mi&s;taken, I have a Letter in my Pocket directed to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith, <HI>Ma&s;ter,</HI> I neither know, nor care to know who he is; for I have been bred a poor Labouring Man all my Days, and have no fancy to be acquainted with great Folks,
<PB N="12" REF="002794_0010_0FE63A575EF89AA8">
or to keep Company above the pitch of a plain Country under&s;tanding; but if my Friend &s;poke any thing out of a grudge, then your great Schollard has di&s;obliged many more than him in this Town; for I think I have been almo&s;t every Night, &s;ince I came here, in a different Company, that at no time con&s;i&s;ted of le&s;s than Seven, and for the mo&s;t part of double that Number; but I never yet heard one good word &s;poke of that &s;ame Great Man; on the other hand, they all agree, that he carries about him, in his very <HI>Gate</HI> and <HI>Phiz,</HI> &s;uch a a <HI>wounded Conceit of his Own Per&s;on,</HI> that he can|not conde&s;cend to be <HI>commonly Civil</HI> to his Bet|ters or Equals, and di&s;dains to be at the trouble of &s;hewing the lea&s;t <HI>Humanity</HI> to tho&s;e below him: In &s;hort, if I be rightly informed, he &s;eems to think that Mankind in all &s;tations of Life cannot be imploy'd to &s;o good Purpo&s;e, any other way, as in executing the Projects of his Brain.</P>

<P>I cannot tell how to believe it, for its but 24 hours &s;ince I arrived here directly from <HI>London,</HI> and there was no &s;uch Report there when I came away, nor any grounds for it, I remember, indeed, to have heard one or two little Fellows, who had lately com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> over from the&s;e Parts, Prate in the Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">-Hou&s;e as if they did not like the pre&s;ent Go|vernor, and hoping he would &s;oon be Remo|ved; but they talk't after &s;uch a &s;illy manner that no body minded them; and I am &s;ure of it, that among&s;t People of the be&s;t Judgment, the Governour's whole Conduct here, and e&s;pecially his Extraordinary good Mannage|ment with the <HI>Indians,</HI> and his great Regard to <HI>Liberty of Con&s;cience,</HI> as well as to every part of <HI>Natural Ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>Equity,</HI> was much Commended; and I really took a great deal of Plea&s;ure to hear &s;ome particular Conver&s;ation on that head, altho' I was altogether a &s;tranger to the Gentlemans Per&s;on &amp; Character before.</P>

<P>Why, if the Con&s;titution really is &s;uch as you have told me, the Con&s;equence, in all Probability, would be, that in a Short time the Tool, as you call him, would find him&s;elf under &s;ome Nece&s;&s;ity of Returning Home as great a Fool as he came out; and let High-flyers talk as they plea&s;e, it is a cer|tain Truth, That there can be no better Te&s;t of a good King or a good Governour, than to po&s;&s;e&s;s the Hearts and Affections of the People they Rule over; for that can proceed only from a natural and grateful Sen&s;e of the Bene|fits which from his Impartial Conduct has been equally &s;hared among&s;t them. And you may depend upon it, <HI>Roger,</HI> that all Men of any Sen&s;e &amp; Knowledge, who De&s;pi&s;e or Ridicule

this very plain Maxim, let them pretend <HI>Con|&s;cience, Religion,</HI> or what el&s;e they plea&s;e, to gull and cheat the Ignorant and Weaker &s;ort of People, it is only a Mask to cover &s;ome &s;ecret Vice, or to introduce one or more par|ticular Favourites, who cannot be &s;upported but by an Arbitrary and Partial Power in the Government.</P>

<P>Ma&s;ter, you know it was always my Mind that Kings and Rulers were appoint|ed for the good of the People; and can any Man tell me who is or can be a better Judge of the Peoples good, than they are them&s;elves? As for your Learned Schollards, tho' perhaps they will not allow Us poor Country Folks to put Our Thinking Faculty in the Ballance with theirs, on many Subjects, which, in truth, We do not pretend to, yet &s;urely they mu&s;t own, We are made of the &s;ame Fle&s;h and Bones, and after the &s;ame manner with them|&s;elves, to that our Sen&s;e and Feeling of Hap|pine&s;s and Mi&s;ery, Ju&s;tice and Inju&s;tice, good Fortune and ill Fortune, are much the &s;ame in Us all. And I appeal to you, Ma&s;ter, if a quiet Enjoyment of, and an equal Support under the&s;e oppo&s;ite States in Life, re&s;pective|ly, be not the chief End, if not the whole Bu&s;ine&s;s of all Civil Government?</P>

<P>Why then, <HI>Roger,</HI> &s;ince you mu&s;t have it, you mu&s;t know, that in the fir&s;t place I went this Morning, about &s;even a Clock, to deliver a &s;mall Pacquet, that I had charge of, to the Governor, and not intending to wait upon &s;o great a Man at that early hour, nor
<PB N="20" REF="002794_0018_0FE5F58038F0EB68">
to give him any manner of Trouble, I only deliver'd the Pacquet to a Jolly Ruddy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> well look'd Servant at the Door, without leaving my Name, or any Me&s;&s;age what&s;o|ever; but the Servant at once de&s;ired me to walk into the Hall and &s;it down, told me his Ma&s;ter had been up in his Study above an hour, and would wait upon me pre&s;ently; and accordingly, in le&s;s than three Minutes the Governor came down in his Night Gown, took me by the hand, and &s;ate down clo&s;e by me; after a few general Que&s;tions, of what Pa&s;&s;age we had? and if I had heard about what time the King might be expected home from <HI>Hannover?</HI> he call'd for a Dram of very fine Cor|dial, and drank my Wellcome to the Place: Then he asked me, If I intended to make any &s;tay in Town?

<P>A Ju&s;t &s;hare of Affability and Com|plai&s;ance in a great Man, is a &s;ure &s;ign of a Noble Spirit; and it not only gives lu&s;ture to his other good Qualities, but attones for and often decently covers many &s;mall Failings. But to proceed, from hence I went in cour&s;e to wait upon the next Greate&s;t Man of the place, Unto whom, I know, that I was very par|ticularly and warmly Recommended by Let|ters from Per&s;ons of &s;ome Figure and great Sub&s;tance in the City of <HI>London,</HI> and being Charged to deliver them with my own hand, I de&s;ired the &s;ervant Maid to acquaint her <HI>Ma&s;ter,</HI> that a Gentleman come over from <HI>London,</HI> in the la&s;t Ship, waited to &s;peak with him, and had &s;ome Letters for him; but the Maid was imploy'd in celaning the Parlour, and very briskly replyed, That it was not yet the hour of her Ma&s;ters coming down from his Study, and that if I wanted to &s;peak with him, I might wait in the Porch until he came down; I &s;aid, I would, and &s;o &s;ate down upon the Bench at the Door, plea&s;ing my &s;elf with Ob&s;erving the Air and Dre&s;s of the People, as they went along. When I had waited about an hour, a Poor Shabby-like fellow called to &s;peak with the Gentleman of the hou&s;e, but the Maid in a rude Tone bid him be gone, for a &s;orry follow,
<PB N="22" REF="002794_0020_0FE5F576F850B3C8">
as he was, did let think that her Ma&s;ter mu&s;t be di&s;turbed at this time of Day for &s;uch a one as him: The Country Man being thus pro|voked, made a good dear of Noi&s;e in the &s;treet, and Complain'd much of the Inju&s;tice and Hard&s;hip that in many particulars had been put upon him. This di&s;turbance, however, brought the Gentleman down from his &s;tudy, in his Di&s;abila, being wrap'd in an old ru&s;ty dark colour'd Calaminco Night-Gown, which forced my Imagination to repre&s;ent to my thoughts One of our <HI>London</HI> Conjurers or Fortune-Tellers, only he did not carry &s;o much Temper and Gravity about him, as they u&s;ual|ly do; for he immediately fell open Mouth'd upon the Poor Fellow in the &s;treet, and bid him in&s;tantly be gone, or he would &s;end him to the Correction-hou&s;e to beat Hemp, until he &s;hould learn more Manners; at which the Country-man &s;cratch'd his Head, and walk'd off. Then the Senator turning him&s;elf very Solemnly about towards me, &s;aid, <HI>Friend, ha&s;t thee any bu&s;ine&s;s with me this Morning</HI>? Very little, <HI>Sir,</HI> &s;aid I, only a few Letters here from <HI>London,</HI> which I was Charged to deliver with my own hand.

<P>Ay, that's true indeed, <HI>Ma&s;ter,</HI> you have Cheer'd me many a time, when my Heart was in my Ho&s;e; but if what my Land|lord told me be true, we are got on the wrong &s;ide of the Hedge, and I am afraid this Cli|mate will &s;oon become too hot for &s;uch free-heart<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d Body's as you and I.</P>

<P>Alack-a-day, Ma&s;ter! That is not what I mean, it is that &s;ame Va&s;&s;alage or Slavery that &s;ticks in my Gizzard; for my Land|lord a&s;&s;ures me, that a great and a Wi&s;e Man, not far from this Town, has been Plodding above the&s;e three years upon a Scheme to In|troduce the <HI>Old Engli&s;h Va&s;&s;alage,</HI> you was &s;peaking of, into this New Country, which he Affirms, cannot thrive until that be done; and, for my part, I had as lief be a Slave in <HI>Algiers,</HI> as to &s;ubmit to &s;uch a form of Govern|ment.</P>

<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why &s;o I &s;aid, Ma&s;ter, but my Landlord, who is a very hone&s;t Civil Man, a&s;&s;ured me, that he heard the Gentleman &s;peak of it him&s;elf, and he talk'd &s;o big as if he was &s;ure to bring it about &s;peedily; for, they &s;ay, he is a very Rich Cunning Man, and &s;ees a great way off, &s;o that he &s;eldom or never

<P>Very true, Ma&s;ter, it is to be hoped that &s;uch a mad Attempt will Probably termi|nate in the Overthrow of the Contrivers; but in the the mean time, both publick and private Intere&s;t mu&s;t &s;uffer con&s;iderably, while &s;uch mi&s;chievous De&s;igns are hatcht and flyly car|rie'd On by Men of any Credit; wherefore, methinks, it is pitty but &s;uch Helli&s;h Schemes &s;hould be expo&s;ed as &s;oon as they can be di&s;|cover'd, and intirely blown Up.</P>

<P>MA&s;ter <HI>Ob&s;ervator,</HI> I want very much to &s;peak with you; pray &s;tep into this next Hou&s;e, and let us drink one Mug together this Morning; for I have a grievous Complaint to make con|cerning my poor Boy <HI>Humphry,</HI> who, I think, has been very ill u&s;ed by &s;ome of your great Leading Men here, and their Under-&s;trappers.</P>

<P>What's the matter, <HI>Roger?</HI> I am &s;orry to hear that poor <HI>Humphry</HI> &s;hould meet with any Di&s;couragement; I thought he had got his Ax on his &s;houlder and been at work in the Woods; for I know he's a &s;ober Lad, and eats no idle Bread.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why truly, &s;o he is, <HI>Ma&s;ter,</HI> and I thought I had done very well for him, upon our arrival, the very fir&s;t week
<PB N="40" REF="002794_0038_0FE63A7EF0E96490">
here, when I Purcha&s;ed three Hundred Acres of good Rich Land, from an hone&s;t Country-man in <HI>Bucks County,</HI> about Twenty Miles from Town; I am &s;ure it co&s;t me Fifty good Guineas in Gold, be|&s;ides two to the Scrivener for drawing the Deeds, and a good Supper at the clo&s;e of the Bargain; and yet, for all, we are like to be Trick'd out of it, for what I can &s;ee, by an Old half hanged ill looking Dog, who keeps the Books of what they call a Land-Office in thir Town. Now, <HI>Ma&s;ter,</HI> you know, in <HI>England</HI> every Free-holder keeps his Writings or Deeds for his Land him&s;elf, in a good Iron Box or &s;trong Che&s;t; but this Gallimafry will have it, that our Deeds are good for no|thing becau&s;e the Return of the Survey was not in due time (as he &s;ays) Record|ed in his Office upon the Books; and the Old Rogue pretends it is too late now, becau&s;e, for&s;ooth, (the Land being very good) he has taken care to have it Re|&s;urveyed, and a Return duly entred upon his Books, in another Mans Name. And now, <HI>Ma&s;ter,</HI> is not this, do you think, a very hand Ca&s;e upon the poor Boy
<PB N="41" REF="002794_0039_0FE63A7EF518F8C8">
<HI>Humphry,</HI> who has almo&s;t Cry'd his very Eyes out of his Head about it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ob&s;erv.</SPEAKER>
<P>It &s;eems to me to be a very hard Ca&s;e indeed, <HI>Roger,</HI> and according to my &s;light Notions of &s;uch Things, I cannot &s;ee how the &s;uperficial Neglect of a Surveyor for not Returning the Perform|ance of his Duty into a certain Office, at a certain time, &s;hould invalidate a Prior and give a legal Preference to a Po&s;terior Right to Lands, which in <HI>England</HI> we hold to be the mo&s;t Sacred and Valuable of all Property what&s;oever.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, Ma&s;ter, in <HI>England,</HI> you &s;ay Right, no &s;uch thing could be &s;uffer'd or born with; for it is to be &s;een very lately, how our ju&s;t and good Parliament at Home can Trounce even a Lord High Chancellor for Defrauding the Subject, and Invading their Rights. But, Alas! <HI>Ma&s;ter,</HI> if I be rightly informed, it is not &s;o here, where we are told, the Soil originally belongs to a Proprietary, and this &s;ame Proprietary keeps an Agent or Secretary, as &s;ome call him, to Sell the&s;e Lands for ready Money; and this
<PB N="24" REF="002794_0040_0FE63A46CB7F40A8">
&s;ame Secretary keeps Two Under-&s;trap|pers at one Table in his Office, the one to make out and Return Surveys, while the other is &s;triking or Recording of Patents, or Original Deeds, all which you may &s;ee them To&s;s from one to ano|ther, as if they were &s;huffling a Pack of Cards at Put; &s;o that an hone&s;t Country-Man has but a poor Chance for his Money among&s;t &s;uch a parcel of Rooks, who are Ab&s;olute in their Mannagement, with|out any manner of Check or Controul.</P>

<P>Thou give&s;t a very odd Ac|count of this Land-Office, <HI>Roger;</HI> &s;urely the Proprietor mu&s;t have a careful Audit upon the&s;e Officers Accounts, if he puts any Value upon his Property here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, <HI>Ma&s;ter,</HI> the Proprietor, they &s;ay, is a very Worthy Hone&s;t young Gentleman, of Spirit enough, but having a good E&s;tate at home, he likes <HI>Old England,</HI> and does not much Trouble him&s;elf about the &s;tate of his Private Affairs here, which this &s;ame Cuning Agent has Artfully involved, by rai&s;ing
<PB N="43" REF="002794_0041_0FE63A4CCA67BA10">
a Claim upon it from &s;ome younger Bran|ches of the Family, who are at Law with the Heir, which is a fair opportunity for cer|tain Folks to make &s;omething, not as the Old Saying is, <HI>While the Sun shines,</HI> but rather <HI>While he is under a Cloud.</HI></P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>We had a great deal of Talk, <HI>Ma&s;ter,</HI> of that &s;ame Company, at our Club t'other Night, where it was &s;aid, That Two of them had been in <HI>England</HI> this Ten Months purcha&s;ing all the Old Rights, Claims or Titles, of any &s;ort, they could po&s;&s;ibly meet with or trump up; for they value no Oppo&s;ition what|&s;oever,

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ob&s;erv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but <HI>Roger,</HI> it is &s;trange to conceive how the&s;e Men can Propo&s;e to carry on Projects and Monopolies over the Belly of Laws, Con&s;titutions and ju&s;t Rights, which they will mo&s;t cer|tainly find are very hard to be Overcome after that manner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord, <HI>Ma&s;ter!</HI> is it a plain Ca&s;e, if they can once get in to be Proprietors of the Lands, they will &s;oon be the Law-Makers them&s;elves; for you mu&s;t know, that the A&s;&s;embly or Legi&s;lature here, is chiefly compo&s;ed of a Landed Intere&s;t, as indeed it is with Us in the Hou&s;e of Commons in <HI>England;</HI> but God be prai&s;|ed, our Rights are better &s;ecured There; and until &s;omething be done to render Property more certain Here, I cannot but pity the poor People who&s;e Children, in all Probability mu&s;t depend on this
