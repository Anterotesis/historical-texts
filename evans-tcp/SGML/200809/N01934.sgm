<HEAD>A Memorial Relating to the <HI>Kennebeck</HI> Indians.</HEAD>
<P>THAT my often &s;peaking the &s;ame things, may not be gravaminous; I humbly offer my Sentiments about &s;ending a Military Force again&s;t the <HI>Kennebeck</HI> Indians, in Writing.</P>
<P>IT is Re&s;olved that the Government has <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="5 letters">cient Rea&s;on to pro&s;e|cute the <HI>Ea&s;tern Indians</HI> for their Rebellion. But I am humbly of Opinion, that &s;ufficient Enquiry has not bee<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 word"> made, Whether the Government has done all that is nece&s;&s;ary on <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="2 letters">r part, to prevent a Rupture.</P>
<P>AT the Conference of his Excellency with the Sachems, and Chief Men of the <HI>Ea&s;tern Indians,</HI> at <HI>George-Town</HI> on <HI>Arrow&s;ick</HI> I&s;land, <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> 9. 1717. The Indians &s;hewed a great Reluctancy again&s;t Erecting Forts higher up the River; and again&s;t the arrival of a Multitude of New Inhabitants; le&s;t they &s;hould prove unable heartily to embrace them. They al&s;o de&s;ired the Running of a Line between the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and them; and made &s;ome Propo&s;als on their part, which were rejected: but no Propo&s;als for fixing Boundaries, were offered to them.</P>
<P>WITHOUT doubt, Boundaries are nece&s;&s;ary for the pre&s;ervation of Hone&s;ty and Peace among tho&s;e that border one upon another. This is evident from the Law made for the Renewing of them between Town&s;hips once in three Years time, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively; and the penalty of Five Pounds inflicted on tho&s;e, who &s;hall neglect their Duty herein.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="002292_0002_0FDB1BF993645EE8">THE Royal Charter gives a good Account of the Errand of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Chri&s;tians into this New World, in the Words following; &mdash; <Q>And to di&s;po&s;e of matters and things, whereby Our Subjects, Inhabi|tants of Our &s;aid Province, may be religiou&s;ly, peaceably, and civilly, governed, protected, and defended; &s;o as their good Life, and Or|derly Conver&s;ation, may Win the <HI>Indians,</HI> Natives of the Country, to the Knowledge and Obedience of the only True GOD, and Saviour of Mankind, and the Chri&s;tian Faith: Which His Royal Maje&s;ty, Our Royal Grand-father, King <HI>Charles</HI> the Fir&s;t, in His &s;aid Letters Patents, Declared was His Royal Intention, and the adventurers free Profe&s;&s;ion, to be the principal End of the &s;aid <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">.</Q></P>
<P>BY this Momentous clau&s;e in our Charter, the Government is Obli|ged, and excited, to doe what in them lyes, to Recover the Aboriginal Natives from their Heatheni&s;me, and Antichri&s;tiani&s;me.</P>
<P>OUR Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour's Method of Conver&s;ion was, To Heal the Bodies of Men and Women, in order to His entire, and Eternal Salva|tion of them. This con&s;trains me to think, that it is Nece&s;&s;ary to &s;tate and &s;ettle plain and la&s;ting Bounds between the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and the <HI>Indians;</HI> that &s;o the Natives may have a certain and e&s;tabli&s;h'd Enjoyment of their O<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> Country: and that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> may have DEUS NOBISCUM Legibly embroidered in their Banners.</P>
<P>THE Hi&s;tory of the War between the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> and their Brethren the <HI>Benjamites,</HI> is very awfull. The <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> had a va&s;t Army: Four Hundred Thou&s;and Fighting Men; the <HI>Benjamites</HI> had only Twenty Six Thou&s;and, and Seven Hundred: And yet the <HI>Benjamites</HI> (the Flameable cau&s;es of the War) Slew Forty Thou&s;and Men of the <HI>I&s;raelites.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Omne prius tentandum e&s;t &mdash;</HI></P>
<P>AND if, at la&s;t, we &s;hould be provoked to goe again&s;t our Neigh|bours, the <HI>Kennebeck</HI> Indians; 'twould be convenient for this Go|vernment fir&s;t to &s;it down, and count the Co&s;t. Many Thou&s;ands of Pounds have been already expended on this Controver&s;y. If the War proceed, and be pro&s;pered; the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> may, probably, drive
<PB N="3" REF="002292_0003_0FDB1BFB23FF1E50">the <HI>Indians</HI> from their ancient Habitation: Yet 'tis improbable the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;hould &s;lay them, or take them Captives. In all likelihood, the Survivours will fly away to <HI>Cannada.</HI> And if a War &s;hould happen between <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and <HI>France;</HI> the&s;e Fugitives would &s;olicit the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the <HI>French,</HI> in returning to their Country (which they are very fond of) though it &s;hould be never &s;o much to the Lo&s;s and Damage of the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>SO that I am humbly of Opinion, 'Twould be mo&s;t Honourable, and mo&s;t Profitable, for this Province, to per&s;wade the <HI>Kennebeck</HI> Indians to be our Dependents and Friends, by Really convincing them, it is their True Intere&s;t &s;o to be; as indeed it is.</P>
<P>WHICH is humbly &s;ubmitted to his Excellency the Gover|nour, the Honourable Council and Repre&s;entatives, in General Court a&s;&s;embled.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>&mdash;IN our Charter, and al&s;o in the Charter of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> the King &s;ays, That the Undertakers do profe&s;s it to be their principal De&s;ign, to bring the <HI>Indians</HI> to the Chri&s;tian Faith.</P>
<P>I am afraid Whether we doe not provoke GOD, by our Neglect of Pro&s;ecuting that De&s;ign. Somthing has been done at the Co&s;t of Benefactors in <HI>England:</HI> but, very little at the Charge of the Country. &mdash; I am never like to &s;ee my Friends in <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> any more; but I often Remember them, and am a Well-willer to them, and particularly, to your &s;elf.</P>
