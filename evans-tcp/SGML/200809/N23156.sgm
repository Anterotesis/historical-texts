<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">THE AUTHOR, TO ALL HIS FELLOW-SINNERS, PARTAKERS IN COMMON WITH HIM IN GUILT AND WOE.</HEAD>
<P>OUR great and common Parent hath been plea&s;ed to give us a place among his rational, and immortal creatures, and made us capable of great and everla&s;ting happine&s;s or mi&s;ery. Which of the&s;e &s;hall be our lot to all eternity, depends on his good, holy, and &s;ove|reign will alone. Not many of us are ordina|rily much attentive to either, except in regard to the pre&s;ent life and world; yet were we wi&s;e, our main concern and attention would be conver&s;ant with our intere&s;t in a future &s;tate, and we &s;hould make the pre&s;ent life wholly &s;ub|&s;ervient to that intere&s;t.</P>
<P>But however inattentive mo&s;t are to the&s;e things, there are in the world, and always have been, many individuals &s;cattered here and there,
<PB N="iv" REF="030609_0004_0FE82BBEC425EF78">
who&s;e minds have been deeply impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e of eternal things. They of this de&s;crip|tion and no other, will pay much attention to what I here offer.</P>
<P>The author has often been too precipitate and ha&s;ty in many things; but in no wi&s;e &s;o in embracing the doctrine here advanced. He is now pa&s;&s;ing the meridian of life; and this opinion of the way of &s;alvation is the re&s;ult of his mo&s;t careful enquiry from the days of his early youth.</P>
<P>His fir&s;t idea of the way of &s;alvation, was this, viz. That by the grace of God, and by a diligent u&s;e of means, he mu&s;t obtain &s;ome <HI>val|uable di&s;tinction</HI> between him&s;elf and other &s;in|ners. That when God &s;aw <HI>this,</HI> his heart would be moved thereby, to give him regenerating and converting grace, and then would be holden thereby in a way of <HI>mere grace,</HI> by go&s;pel con|&s;titution, to confer eternal &s;alvation.</P>
<P>Upon this plan he labored much in early life, but the re&s;ult was not as he expected; it ended in total de&s;pair. For the more he la|bored for a good hope in this way, the more he was convinced of his awful de&s;titution of all &s;uch di&s;tinctions and qualifications. He was then led to take refuge, and found great relief in that grace, which he &s;aw to be ab&s;olutely &s;ove|reign, flowing out of the very nature of God, through Chri&s;t; not moved by any di&s;tinctions or previous qualifications in &s;inners; but from
<PB N="v" REF="030609_0005_0FE82BC52EEEA600">
the nature of God, wholly &s;elf-moved, according to the free electing love of God. A view of which might bring a joyful &s;en&s;e of &s;alvation to the mo&s;t vicious, &s;tupid, hardened &s;inner, as well as to him&s;elf. Yet &s;till he had no idea of any &s;alvation beyond the more common, and <HI>much li|mited</HI> idea of God's election and &s;alvation.</P>
<P>Being much di&s;po&s;ed to a &s;tudious life, and always delighting greatly in books, he &s;pent much of his time in reading and enquiry, in the early periods of life. Amid&s;t all the vanities and fol|lies of youth, yet acquainting his heart with wi&s;|dom, even while he too much laid hold on folly. Being al&s;o much favored, by a kind Providence, with regard to the be&s;t means of in&s;truction, and a pious example from his parents in his early days, and afterwards with a more public educa|tion; the di&s;po&s;ition of his heart inclined him, in great preference to all other employments, to the &s;tudy of divinity, and to become a preacher of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>He was now in tho&s;e principles which we call <HI>Calvini&s;tic;</HI> and met with &s;ome acceptance in his public performances, and &s;oon took the pa&s;toral charge of a kind and re&s;pectable people, from whom he has ever &s;ince received as many kindne&s;&s;es as mo&s;t of his brethren in the mini&s;try have. Living in a &s;eries of harmony and love, excepting only with re&s;pect to a very few indi|viduals, at one time and another, who yet have given him no great trouble.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="030609_0006_0FE82BC6B6EE7C18">He, for &s;everal years, under&s;tood the way of &s;alvation taught in the word of God, (which he always regarded as the only deci&s;ive rule of faith and life,) agreeably, in all e&s;&s;ential mat|ters, to the explanations of Mr. <HI>Calvin,</HI> Dr. <HI>Ow|en,</HI> Mr. <HI>Willard,</HI> Pre&s;ident <HI>Edwards,</HI> and the great body of puritan divines &s;ince the reformation from popery. Not as yet thinking of any ex|tent of the divine decrees, or God's eternal pur|po&s;es of love to a lo&s;t world, beyond the com|mon orthodoxy of his country; or what, for want of a more &s;ignificant word, he would call <HI>the limitarian plan.</HI> By degrees, he began to be pre&s;&s;ed more and more in his own mind, with regard to the full con&s;i&s;tency of it.</P>
<P>He preached, as did other divines, the atone|ment of Chri&s;t, a full and complete &s;acrifice for the redemption of every &s;inner in the world; and the divine law wholly &s;atisfied in the obe|dience of Chri&s;t unto death; that every &s;inner on earth, was alike invited, and mo&s;t &s;olemnly commanded to believe on Chri&s;t to the &s;aving of his &s;oul; that it was the greate&s;t of all &s;in and rebellion again&s;t God, not to believe unto &s;alva|tion, and alike &s;o, in every &s;inner that heard the go&s;pel; and, that &s;aving faith did not <HI>create,</HI> or in the lea&s;t <HI>change</HI> the object or foundation of it, but was wholly grounded on an object and foundation forever immutable.</P>
<P>The&s;e doctrines he urged, from the nature and attributes of God; the covenant of redemp|tion; and the dying love of Chri&s;t, as di&s;played
<PB N="vii" REF="030609_0007_0FE82BCB55785A68">
in the book of divine revelation. And, on the &s;ame principles, always enforced holine&s;s and vir|tue, as a native and genuine con&s;equence of a cordial belief of them; and al&s;o as being mo&s;t rea&s;onable and happifying in the very nature of things. Meanwhile often denouncing the dread|ful wrath of God, revealed from heaven again&s;t all ungodline&s;s, and unrighteou&s;ne&s;s of men. His preaching was of this tenor, with all the u&s;es of it, and inferences that might be drawn from it; on the idea of a <HI>limited</HI> decree, and a <HI>limited</HI> &s;cheme of redemption and &s;alvation.</P>
<P>The author holds all the&s;e doctrines <HI>of grace</HI> and <HI>of duty,</HI> more firmly now, if po&s;&s;ible, than ever before; except only with regard to the <HI>limitation</HI> of the covenant of redemption, as not according to the eternal purpo&s;e of God.</P>
<P>What has lain on his mind with increa&s;ing pre&s;&s;ure is this. When he had exhibited to his audience the infinite fulne&s;s and all-&s;ufficiency of Chri&s;t to &s;ave &s;inners, both by price and by pow|er; and the great duty of every &s;inner to believe it to the &s;alvation of his &s;oul, then to tell them;
<Q><HI>Many &s;inners, many alas! are left out of the covenant of redemption; many for whom Chri&s;t never died.</HI> A part only are comprehended, a very few in compari&s;on <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> we have rea&s;on to believe, or at lea&s;t to fear. How many we cannot &s;ay, nor who they are, God will cer|tainly make &s;uch as are elected, to believe, by his own almighty power and grace; and he will mo&s;t certainly leave all the re&s;t to
<PB N="viii" REF="030609_0008_0FE82B6E6404EE98">
eternal damnation as their &s;ins ju&s;tly de&s;erve for they were never comprehended in the de|cree of God or the covenant of redemption and &s;alvation.</Q>
I have been more and more pre&s;&s;ed and perplexed in my own mind, with regard to the con&s;i&s;tency of this manner of preaching with it&s;elf, or with the word of God. I have often taken up the objections that have been brought again&s;t it, and have attempted to re|move them in the common way, and done it to as general &s;atisfaction, perhaps, as other preachers.</P>
<P>The arguments u&s;ed to &s;ilence the&s;e objections are &s;o trite and familiar with every one, that I need only hint at them now. I have told my au|dience that we all ju&s;tly de&s;erve to be eternally mi&s;erable; that God was not obliged to &s;ave any; that he is a ju&s;t, ab&s;olute &s;overeign: the repro|bate, or non-elect have no cau&s;e to impeach God of any inju&s;tice; they &s;hall receive only the due reward of their deeds; that they may believe if they will; that it is the wickedne&s;s of their hearts, their wills, and di&s;po&s;itions that hinders them; the heart at enmity with God; and that this is &s;o far from being their rea&s;onable excu&s;e, that it is their ju&s;t, and mo&s;t awful condemnation; that they have no bu&s;ine&s;s with God's &s;ecret, eternal decree, or the extent of the covenant of redemption, and the number given to Chri&s;t therein, and for whom alone he died; that they mu&s;t attend only to what God has revealed; that he will have all men to be &s;aved; that he taketh no plea&s;ure in the death of him that dieth,
<PB N="ix" REF="030609_0009_0FE82BE7D6A43808">
but that he would turn and live; that he plain|ly commandeth all men every where to repent, and believe to the &s;aving of their &s;ouls; that the &s;ecret decree of God can have no influence on their wills, and ought to have none on their conduct. So I have gone through with all the common arguments as other mini&s;ters of the go&s;|pel have &s;o often done. The&s;e the reader has all by heart, if he has paid any tolerable at|tention to the common preaching of calvini&s;tic divines.</P>
<P>My audience have generally almo&s;t to a man &s;et down &s;atisfied. Yet, at evening&punc; much per|plexity hath invaded my own mind; thoughts have thus returned upon me. I have this day told my audience, making no difference, and without the exception of a &s;ingle per&s;on, that if we do not believe that God hath given to us eternal life in his Son, we make him a liar; and quoted the evangeli&s;t John in &s;upport of it. I have told them, that they have, every one alike, all the warrant, that the God of truth can give them, to believe to eternal life; and that it is the greate&s;t of all &s;in not thus to believe. I have told them that their acting this faith on the Son of God, can lay no foun|dation at all, but is wholly built on an eter|nal foundation already laid, the immutable truth of God in his Son. I have told them they mu&s;t &s;o believe; they have right to, they ought to do it; and then every one of them &s;hall be
<PB N="x" REF="030609_0010_0FE82BB51DFFBFA0">
&s;aved. When upon the <HI>limitarian</HI> plan, I know not that one tenth part of them, or even one of them was ever included in the covenant of redemption, or given to Chri&s;t, or that he ever died for one &s;oul of them.</P>
<P>Ought I not to have known for whom among them Chri&s;t did indeed die, before I gave out this doctrine; and then to have addre&s;&s;ed the &s;ame to them only? or ought I not, at lea&s;t, to have &s;poken hypothetically and &s;aid; <HI>if you are of the number of the elect,</HI> you have full warrant and ground to believe to &s;alvation. Otherwi&s;e there is no foundation laid in Chri&s;t for your faith; but, on the contrary, you will make God a liar in &s;o believing, as you will believe what he knows is not true, viz. that every &s;oul that hears the go&s;|pel has a foundation for his &s;aving faith, laid in Chri&s;t?</P>
<P>I have told my audience that the number given to Chri&s;t, and for whom he died, is a &s;ecret that belongs to God only, and not at all to them. And, that it is their great duty to make their calling and election &s;ure. I have quieted their minds, but not my own. For I cannot avoid ma|ny thoughts which have never occurred to their minds, on the <HI>limitarian</HI> plan. I cannot help &s;ee|ing, that although, <HI>on this plan,</HI> the number and the names are a &s;ecret with God alone; yet the principles are what I have been preaching. I have a&s;&s;erted them as revealed in the word of God, I have proclaimed them aloud, as the will of God; and now how, alas! &s;hall I reconcile them in harmonious truth?</P>
<P><PB N="xi" REF="030609_0011_0FE82BED54C8A208">I can very willingly let alone the <HI>number</HI> and the <HI>names; that</HI> &s;its ea&s;y on my mind. But what &s;hall I do with the principles I have advan|ced as things revealed and belonging to every &s;inner in the world? How can I, on the&s;e princi|ples, the&s;e revealed doctrines, invite and com|mand every &s;inner to believe to &s;alvation, and in the name of Chri&s;t too, tell every one, without exception, that Chri&s;t has laid a foundation for this univer&s;al faith and &s;alvation; when I believe he did, in his death, lay a foundation only for a part; that only a part are given to him, and that "other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid, which is Je&s;us Chri&s;t?" Many &s;im|ilar thoughts have unavoidably pre&s;&s;ed into my mind, after I have been preaching the go&s;pel in the limitarian line.</P>
<P>The learned reader will readily recollect the way that &s;everal learned and pious divines have taken to free them&s;elves from this perplexity. They a&s;&s;ert, that all &s;inners are commanded to believe that which has <HI>no truth</HI> in it, antecedent to their believing it; and that in the devout and obedient exerci&s;e of their minds in believing, <HI>that</HI> is turned into a glorious, &s;aving truth, which had no truth in it when their minds fir&s;t began to work upon it. This they &s;ay is a mo&s;t <HI>inconceiva|ble, a&s;toni&s;hing my&s;tery.</HI> I think &s;o too, and can get no relief to my own mind in that way. If I could believe without previous truth, and make truth by believing, I &s;hould believe my&s;elf into the enjoyment of many agreeable things, tem|poral as well as &s;piritual: Yet even men of no
<PB N="xii" REF="030609_0012_0FE82B73F1F3CFB0">
le&s;s worth than, Me&s;&s;rs <HI>Bo&s;ton, Mar&s;hall, Hervey,</HI> and others I might name, have taken that refuge; and merely, no doubt, becau&s;e they could not po&s;&s;ibly reconcile the <HI>limitarian</HI> doctrines of &s;al|vation in any other way.</P>
<P>The&s;e embarra&s;&s;ments in my mind, have in|duced me to look, mo&s;t attentively, into all opinions that have ever been found among all &s;ects that embrace divine revelation; and e&s;pecially the <HI>neonomian</HI> and the <HI>arminian</HI> tenets. But, on the mo&s;t thorough inve&s;tigation, I find the&s;e incon|&s;i&s;tent with divine revelation, and the nece&s;&s;ary at|tributes of God; al&s;o with the relation of man to his Maker; and with his entire, ab&s;olute, and everla&s;ting dependence on God. Still, the eviden|ces, and even demon&s;trations of the truth, and divinity of the &s;acred oracles are &s;o clear, that I can never renounce my firm faith in them. I al&s;o find, in reading all books of divinity that ever I &s;aw, that the main, leading &s;entiments in them, will mo&s;t inevitably infer the &s;ame exten|&s;ive doctrine of grace and &s;alvation that is here advanced: were all ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equences drawn from tho&s;e foundation principles which all unite in. But, few ju&s;t con&s;equences have been drawn, and many things &s;aid by <HI>limitarians,</HI> of all denominations, in full and plain oppo&s;ition to the foundation principles which they hold.</P>
<P>After all re&s;earches, I have recurred to the word of God alone. There I find a mo&s;t glorious, and a&s;toni&s;hing &s;y&s;tem, and exibitions of divine wi&s;dom, power and love; mo&s;t harmoniou&s;ly con|&s;i&s;tent with it&s;elf, and with all the divine attri|butes,
<PB N="xiii" REF="030609_0013_0FE82BAE97946080">
with pure rea&s;on, and with God's conduct in the univer&s;e; and in a mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed way, accommo|dated and adapted to guilty, mi&s;erable man, in all the depth of his <HI>entire impotency</HI> and guilt: A com|plete Savior undertaking to deliver him alike from both; and that in &s;uch a merciful and glorious extent, that I can in the name of Chri&s;t, com|mand every human creature, under heaven, to believe in &s;uch a Savior, and promi&s;e him, on the &s;ame authority, he &s;hall be &s;aved by him.</P>
<P>I can now preach the go&s;pel to <HI>every crea|ture</HI>; i. e. I can tell every human creature un|der heaven, <HI>Good news to</HI> HIM. I can tell every creature of a Savior as complete to <HI>give him</HI> the <HI>qualification,</HI> as to make the <HI>atonement;</HI> to give repentance as well as forgivene&s;s of &s;ins, alike engaging and en&s;uring both, by covenant with his Father. A ble&s;&s;ed Savior, that hath made his &s;alvation &s;ure, before lo&s;t &s;inners ever thought any thing about it; and that did all the work alone without their doing any thing. That, by the pow|er of his own &s;pirit, he &s;etteth &s;inners to work out their own &s;alvation with fear and trembling: not at all to make it more &s;ure, than he has made it in the covenant of redemption, and the atonement; but only, to communicate the know|ledge, and comfort of it to them, and to ap|ply the benefit, by working in them a moral capacity to enjoy it.</P>
<P>Hence I can bid them, in the name of Chri&s;t, to work out their own &s;alvation with
<PB N="xiv" REF="030609_0014_0FE7EC1AB918AB30">
fear and trembling: for it is God that work|eth in them both to will and to do, of his own good plea&s;ure. I can tell them that the grace of God, alone, brings &s;alvation to their fight and tru&s;t; and that this, in a way of <HI>native con&s;equence,</HI> teaches them to deny ungodline&s;s and every worldly la&s;t, and to live &s;oberly, righte|ou&s;ly, and godly in this pre&s;ent world. Becau&s;e this is God's way, and the only fit way in which God brings them to the final, heavenly inherit|ence, and makes them meet to be partakers of it. Al&s;o, becau&s;e it is mo&s;t rea&s;onable, and an exceeding great plea&s;ure and delight to them while on the way: And as in all re&s;pects it is mo&s;t agreeable to the natures God has given them; to their moral agency; and to the honor of his own name, to bring them to the enjoy|ment of all the &s;ure benefits of redeeming love and grace in &s;uch a way.</P>
<P>On this ground, I can a&s;&s;ure them that God hath given to us <HI>fallen man</HI> eternal life, and this life is in his Son; and he that believeth not this record, <HI>who&s;oever he be,</HI> hath made God a liar. So I can charge any unbeliever with the greate&s;t blame, for not believing <HI>immediately</HI> to the &s;aving of his &s;oul, i. e. to a &s;en&s;e and enjoyment of go&s;pel &s;alvation. And I can pronounce every unbelieving &s;inner damned, i. e. mo&s;t ju&s;tly and awfully condemned while in unbelief. But on the limitarian plan, I can charge no &s;inner with any thing ami&s;s, for not believing to his own &s;alvation; unle&s;s I fir&s;t know, that he is one
<PB N="xv" REF="030609_0015_0FE82B668363FB20">
that is comprehended in their partial and much limited covenant of redemption; or one of the few, or the party, be it more or le&s;s, for who&s;e eternal &s;alvation Chri&s;t died.</P>
<P>The more I have thought on the&s;e things, the more I am convinced of the utter incon&s;i&s;t|ency of the general preaching of prote&s;tant di|vines, on any other ground than this. <HI>Chri&s;t died alike for all. And all mankind are alike included in the mo&s;t glorious and merciful covenant of re|demption.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e, at the &s;ame time, that it is not <HI>expedient</HI> that go&s;pel preachers &s;hould <HI>dwell</HI> much on this point, viz. proving that God will in|deed bring all the fallen race, in his own time, out of their blindne&s;s, guilt, and mi&s;ery, to the knowledge and enjoyment of &s;alvation; or that Chri&s;t will in his own way and time, draw all men unto him, in the plaine&s;t &s;en&s;e of the words. But rather to dwell much, and mainly, on the nature and character of God, and that of fallen man, and the way of &s;alvation for &s;uch a mi&s;erable race; with all the duties, and obli|gations, hopes, and expectations re&s;ulting from the&s;e thoughts.</P>
<P>The great things we want to know, are what God is; and what we are; and how we may plea&s;e God; and in what way we may be &s;av|ed. Merely to know how many, or how few, &s;hall be brought to glory is no part of our &s;aving knowledge. But to know the way to
<PB N="xvi" REF="030609_0016_0FE82B5E9EDF0BB0">
heaven, by &s;aving experience, is the great thing we all need. This is ju&s;t the &s;ame in my view of &s;alvation; as on that of the prote&s;tant world in general, ever &s;ince the reformation from po|pery. Nor &s;hould I think it expedient to pub|li&s;h the following &s;heets, at lea&s;t at this time, were it not that I find I cannot vindicate di|vine revelation on any other plan. I likewi&s;e find many inqui&s;itive minds, deeply concerned about things of eternal con&s;equence, pre&s;&s;ed with the &s;ame embarra&s;&s;ment.</P>
<P>I am well aware, that &s;uch an open <HI>ad|vancing</HI> &s;tep to pour light into the minds of men; though it is no other, in the nature of it, than what has been many times done, may, as in former times, in all probability, be an oc|ca&s;ion of great alarms in the minds of many pious, good people. Among the re&s;t, (which is to me mo&s;t di&s;agreeable in pro&s;pect) &s;everal of my deare&s;t and mo&s;t valuable friends and con|nections will probably be more wounded by this publication, or at lea&s;t more aggrieved, than any other per&s;ons on my account.</P>
<P>But there is a wonderful force in important truth, pre&s;&s;ed home on the human mind with fall conviction. When HE who ruleth the &s;pirits of all men, is determined to make it appear to the world, he always makes the truth pre&s;s &s;o hard on the human mind as to find vent. Witne&s;s the ca&s;e of <HI>Elihu, Jeremiah, Paul,</HI> and many others. Job, 32. Jer. 20. Acts, 18. The mo&s;t of tho&s;e, whom God has made in&s;truments

to give additional light and guidance to his church and to the world, have felt much reluctance on the part of human nature and worldly con|&s;iderations, from the days of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> to the pre|&s;ent day. BUT almighty God always finds an effectual way to draw out of their &s;ouls, what|ever he is plea&s;ed to pour in with &s;pecial de|&s;ign for the benefit of mankind. It is doubtle&s;s by connection and acquaintance with the people of God, that the gentiles, in every part of the world, got this idea of their prophets, &s;ybils, and augurs, in all ages. The celebrated Roman poet, as the learned will recollect, paints this thought mo&s;t beautifully in the ca&s;e of his pro|phete&s;s, in the &s;ixth book of his Aencid. And I apprehend, we may well maintain the doctrine of &s;uch a forcible energy on the mind, in the&s;e ca&s;es, without giving any countenance to en|thu&s;ia&s;m, in the more common acceptation of the word.</P>
<P>What now appears, is a &s;mall part of a SYS|TEM of DIVINITY, which the author has been meditating more than <HI>twenty years.</HI> A critical view of the religion of the covenant people of God, in every age, and in every part of the world, where divine revelation has been em|braced; and al&s;o of the mythology of all the nations of the earth that have not been fav|ored with the &s;acred oracles, fell naturally in the way of his contemplations, as he was pro|ceeding on a very exten&s;ive &s;cale. What he un|dertook
<PB N="xviii" REF="030609_0018_0FE82BCCDF00F748">
was with no other view, than for his own improvement; as he has ever found the u&s;e of the pen of very &s;pecial &s;ervice to his own mind.</P>
<P>Innumerable critici&s;ms on the original lan|guages in which the &s;acred oracles were fir&s;t writ|ten, are left out in this publication. Becau&s;e our Engli&s;h bible is &s;o well done, in the la&s;t tran&s;la|tion, that there is not one ver&s;e, or &s;entence in it, that will mi&s;guide any common, Engli&s;h reader, in any material thought. And becau&s;e, on the contrary, the author did, and does &s;till &s;uppo&s;e, that &s;uch a number of critici&s;ms, as he found his own thoughts naturally led into, would, if in|&s;erted, much bewilder the minds of mo&s;t of his readers. And la&s;tly, this would much &s;well the volume, and embarra&s;s any printer in this coun|try, for want of proper types, and practice.</P>
<P>The following TREATISE is not divided into chapters and &s;ections according to the more com|mon way in later times; but is on the plan of the more ancient compo&s;itions. Moreover, the rea|der will find in many places, that a particular thought, or argument, is taken up and pur&s;ued as far as the pre&s;ent connection required; then laid a&s;ide for the pre&s;ent, and re&s;umed again, in another connection, and enlarged upon in &s;e|parate parts of the volume, with di&s;tinct views, and in various connections. This is no more re|petitious, than if each thought, or argument had been wholly fini&s;hed in one place by it|&s;elf.
<PB N="xix" REF="030609_0019_0FE82CD90B3D22E0">
This method, was cho&s;en becau&s;e the author's de&s;ire was to help the reader, as much as po&s;&s;ible, to carry along in his mind to the end of the whole, every material idea, without the lo&s;s of any.</P>
<P>The author is quite beyond a doubt, in his own mind, with regard to the &s;olid truth of his leading principles and arguments; though he &s;uppo&s;es that inaccuracies may be di&s;cerned by the more critical part of his readers. With re&s;pect to the <HI>due time</HI> of advancing this &s;tep forward, and &s;o explicitly pouring in this ad|ditional light, he is not &s;o po&s;itive.</P>
<P>There are, however, &s;everal con&s;iderations that have weight in my mind, to make the pub|lication without further delay; &s;uch as the&s;e. I have &s;pent more than <HI>twenty years</HI> in the mo&s;t careful reading and attention to every thing relating to this &s;ubject; and, I think, with a &s;ingle eye, and ardent de&s;ire to know the truth, and to avoid all fal&s;e rea&s;oning, and every groundle&s;s conclu&s;ion. <HI>I have no intere&s;t but in the truth.</HI> I am in the &s;ame predicament, with regard to the <HI>due time</HI> of publication, that all men &s;ince the days of in&s;piration have been. Any author may misjudge, after his greate&s;t po&s;&s;i|ble exerci&s;e of judgment in the matter. Some have done it, as the great and learned <HI>Hu&s;s,</HI> who was one century before the <HI>due time,</HI> in attempting to pour in a flood of light upon the world. He offered nothing to the public but what
<PB N="xx" REF="030609_0020_0FE82BEEDC2F35C0">
was advanced in the next century by <HI>Luther, Calvin,</HI> and others with glorious &s;ucce&s;s. I con&s;ider that if all &s;tudents will refrain publication, in advancement of light and knowledge, until they are quite certain the mo&s;t proper time is come; every thing of this kind mu&s;t be at an end. Al&s;o that when God's own time is come, for new acqui&s;itions of knowledge, even then, it is his wi&s;e and holy plea&s;ure, that truth &s;hould beat its way through very con&s;iderable oppo&s;i|tion, and that the leaders in it &s;hould meet with little thanks, and no comfortable reward, from the world in general.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides all this, I regard the marvellous hand of divine providence, &s;ince my own day of ob|&s;ervation, as leading into new acqui&s;itions of every kind more rapidly than in any former period of time. A &s;pirit of <HI>enquiry,</HI> of <HI>light</HI> and <HI>liberty,</HI> does wonderfully increa&s;e. And it hath been my &s;teadfa&s;t opinion, with the vene|rable Edwards and others, who, as I apprehend, have written be&s;t on the prophecies, relating to the latter day glory, that the glorious millen|nium is now dawning, and hath been ever &s;ince the reformation from popery; and that when &s;ix thou&s;and years from the creation of the world are compleated, the &s;un will fairly ari&s;e, even the &s;un of righteou&s;ne&s;s in all his divine glory. That time now draws near. The &s;econd or third generation from us may, &s;ome of them, behold that ble&s;&s;ed day.</P>
<P><PB N="xxi" REF="030609_0021_0FE82BF387D3B150">I am farther fully per&s;uaded, that the glo|rious and univer&s;al revival, and power of true religion in that day, will not be brought on &s;o much by the awful thunderings of divine wrath, and threatnings of hell and damnation, as by leading the blind fearful minds and guilty &s;ouls of men to &s;ee and know the true character of God, and the Savior. When the world &s;hall know the living and true God and Je&s;us Chri&s;t whom he hath &s;ent; then a &s;en&s;e and enjoy|ment of life eternal will abound, and the cords of love will effectually draw dead &s;inners to holine&s;s and virtue.</P>
<P>The reader may naturally expect that I &s;hould take notice of &s;everal writers of late, and &s;ome former writers, on the &s;ubject of the <HI>univer&s;al redemption</HI> and <HI>final &s;alvation</HI> of the human kind; both in &s;upport of the &s;entiment, and in oppo&s;ition thereto. I &s;uppo&s;e I have read them all, from the great <HI>Augu&s;tine</HI> (who ad|vanced the foundation arguments in &s;upport of this doctrine, with greater &s;trength of mind, than any have done &s;ince) down to the pre|&s;ent day. Several learned men have written on the &s;ubject, in Europe and America; &s;ome on one &s;ide of the que&s;tion and &s;ome on the other. I have purpo&s;ely omitted any particular remarks on either: principally becau&s;e it appears to me, that none of them ever &s;ufficiently attended to the &s;ubject to write with full pertinency upon it Though, at the &s;ame time, the author re|gards
<PB N="xxii" REF="030609_0022_0FE82B7659BBA968">
them as much greater and better men than him&s;elf, and would think him&s;elf honored to &s;et at their feet, to receive in&s;truction in any matters they have <HI>fully</HI> attended to.</P>
<P>THE LEADING THOUGHTS, on which the fol|lowing TREATISE is built, may be divided into the following particulars. <HI>The attributes of God. His own fixed eternal purpo&s;es. His covenant of redemption with the Son of his love. The full and proper contra&s;t between the fir&s;t, and &s;econd foederal head of mankind. The doctrine of a true and proper imputation of guilt and righteou&s;ne&s;s. The co-exten&s;ive offices of Chri&s;t, as prophet, prie&s;t, and king. The ju&s;t de&s;ert of &s;in. The voice of God's holy law, and that of the go&s;pel, &s;ounding throughout the whole of divine revelation. The law wholly &s;atisfied in Chri&s;t. The</HI> GOSPEL <HI>announcing the&s;e</HI> GLAD TIDINGS. <HI>The nature and office of regeneration, &s;aving faith, and repentance unto life. The indi&s;pen&s;ible nece&s;&s;ity of internal holine&s;s. The awful damnation of all while unregenerate. The only way, in which God will &s;ave &s;inners, and the infinite rea&s;onablene&s;s of it. The great power of a real acquaintance with the &s;alvation of God, to move the heart to all holine&s;s and virtue; and to regulate the whole life. The ab&s;olute, and everla&s;ting dependance of all the human race on him that made them. And the everla&s;ting glory that will redound to God alone, Father, Son, and Holy Gho&s;t, in this great &s;alvation.</HI></P>
<P>The above are the principal, leading thoughts,
<PB N="xxiii" REF="030609_0023_0FE82BDE5E558890">
illu&s;trated by a variety of arguments; which are indeed but a very &s;mall part of all tho&s;e that might have been adduced, with equal force, from the nature of God and from his word.</P>
<P>The author has one reque&s;t to make to all that may &s;ee, or hear of this book. He a&s;ks that none would either <HI>approve</HI> or <HI>cen&s;ure</HI> it, until after a careful reading. And that all, who may have read it with attention, and then &s;peak freely their own opinion concerning it, as every one in that ca&s;e has good right to do, would al&s;o communicate this humble reque&s;t from the author, to all &s;uch as have knowledge of it only by report. This is a ju&s;t claim, which every man has on his fellow-men; and which every humane, candid mind will readily grant. The author is the more emboldened to make it, as he never could endure to violate the &s;ame prin|ciple him&s;elf, with regard to any writings he has ever &s;een or heard of. Having intimated the&s;e things as introductory, the reader is now led to a direct and immediate con&s;ideration of the &s;ubject.</P>

<HEAD>A TREATISE ON UNIVERSAL SALVATION.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;acred &s;criptures, or the two te&s;taments, are certainly the very dictates of God to men, on the mo&s;t intere&s;ting matters. God hath &s;poken as became him|&s;elf to &s;peak, things mo&s;t important to the human kind; and things in the mo&s;t per|fect con&s;i&s;tency, through the whole of di|vine revelation. The great de&s;ign of it is, that the divine Being and character may be manife&s;ted, in the cleare&s;t po&s;&s;ible man|ner, for the di&s;play of his own glory; and mankind guided thereby to the true end of their exi&s;tence, even the knowledge and enjoyment of God the &s;upreme and con|&s;ummate good. The duty and happine&s;s of man are in&s;eparably united in the &s;acred oracles.</P>
<P>IT is of the utmo&s;t importance to the
<PB N="26" REF="030609_0025_0FE82BF5F29C5068">
comfort of man, to have his mind open, and unbia&s;&s;ed with regard to the truth, heartily engaged to find the very truth, and embrace it with &s;upreme love, for its own &s;ake. This is "a good and hone&s;t heart." This is "receiving truth in the love of it." Alas; how hard an attainment for man in his pre&s;ent &s;tate!</P>
<P>NOW any man that can read the word of God with open candor, will &s;ee, that there are two capital points of in&s;truction run|ning through the whole of it, as things to be believed; and that every where virtue, or holine&s;s of heart and life is enjoined up|on us, as matter of practice, enforced with the &s;tronge&s;t rea&s;ons and motives.</P>
<P>THE two great doctrines we are taught to believe, are, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> What it is ju&s;t and right for God to do with us, con&s;idered in our own per&s;onal character, and de&s;ert. This I &s;hall call the pure voice of ju&s;tice to man, without regard to an atonement, or a mediator. <HI>Secondly,</HI> What God will <HI>in fact</HI> do with mankind, as united to a mediator, and one with him by divine con&s;titution, in a foederal &s;en&s;e: Or how, in very deed, God hath promi&s;ed to deal with man, in that union with the &s;econd Adam: What his condition &s;hall certainly be, in this life, and the life to come. This I call pure go&s;|pels; or tidings from God, which never could have been known but by his own re|velation.</P>
<P>IT will al&s;o appear that the&s;e two capital points are, throughout the whole bible, kept
<PB N="27" REF="030609_0026_0FE82BFB77567D18">
in con&s;tant view, running <HI>&s;ide by &s;ide,</HI> in open &s;ight, from the beginning to the clo&s;e of the &s;acred oracles. The&s;e points are very different from each other, yea directly oppo&s;ite, except only as harmonizing in Chri&s;t, which is the mo&s;t wonderful my&s;tery of the go&s;pel, and the grand di&s;tingui&s;hing doctrine of divine revelation.</P>
<P>TAKE a few in&s;tances of this direct oppo|&s;ition of &s;entiment, if literally under&s;tood, in an immediate and direct import, without any regard to a mediator, an atonement, or a foederal con&s;titution.&mdash;"In the day thou eate&s;t thereof thou &s;halt &s;urely die." "And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years." "Every man &s;hall die for his own &s;ins." "Chri&s;t died for our &s;ins according to the &s;criptures." "God will by no means clear the guilty." "I, even I am he that blotteth out your &s;ins, for mine own &s;ake." The reader that is well acquainted with the book of divine re|velation, will think of thou&s;ands of plain a&s;&s;ertions, as much to the purpo&s;e as the&s;e; and every fair rea&s;oner will own that words and ideas cannot be &s;et in more full oppo&s;i|tion, if taken in one and the &s;ame, plain, immediate, literal &s;en&s;e. Yet we find not the lea&s;t difficulty in reconciling all the&s;e with each other, and with the truth, when we bring them into one proper analogy: We ea&s;ily &s;ee one harmonious, perfectly con|&s;i&s;tent &s;cheme, running through the whole.</P>
<P>BUT, it will abundantly appear in the &s;equel, that we mu&s;t keep our ear open to
<PB N="28" REF="030609_0027_0FE82B847A4BC848">
the voice of pure ju&s;tice to man, as he de|&s;erves out of Chri&s;t; al&s;o to the voice an|nouncing what &s;hall in very deed, through infinite grace, take place with re&s;pect to man in Chri&s;t: Or it will be wholly in vain for all the wit, and art in the world, to make any thing better of the holy &s;criptures, than a long, &s;olemn, &s;eries of the mo&s;t palpable contradictions. I have, with the utmo&s;t caution, and deepe&s;t attention, long con&s;ult|ed the &s;acred oracles; and, perhaps, all of e&s;&s;ential con&s;equence, that has been written on them, &s;ince the chri&s;tian aera, in various languages; and I freely confe&s;s that, with|out the clue, ju&s;t named, I mu&s;t &s;et down in dei&s;m: But, with it, the whole book of God, <HI>how true! how beautiful! how glorious!</HI></P>
<P>THE whole word of God, centers in Chri&s;t, and is &s;ealed in his blood; the law, and go&s;pel, otherwi&s;e oppo&s;ite, are brought into perfect union; righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace embrace each other; and this di&s;play &s;hines, in perpetual and glorious &s;ymmetry, through the old and new te&s;taments.</P>
<P>BUT now, to re&s;ume the capital argu|ment already alluded to.</P>
<P>WE begin with the fir&s;t threatening ever denounced again&s;t man, on condition of his rebellion. Gen. ii. "In the day that thou eate&s;t thereof, thou &s;halt &s;urely die." I believe the more common con&s;truction of this commination, by prote&s;tant divines, is right, viz. that total death, temporal and &s;piritual, was to take place on all human nature, on that very day; and eternal death
<PB N="29" REF="030609_0028_0FE82BFD03066A00">
then begin, and be confirmed and made &s;ure to all human nature, without the lea&s;t in|timation of remedy or relief, to endle&s;s du|ration. I fully believe this con&s;truction is ju&s;t, and abundantly &s;upported in the holy &s;criptures.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, as I am acquainted with many learned, and ingenious critici&s;ms on the words, needle&s;s here to remark upon, I will take a con&s;truction in which all agree as far as it extends; and which will an&s;wer what I am now aiming at, as well as that which is more agreeable to my own mind. It is certainly true, as far as it goes; though I &s;uppo&s;e it does not contain the whole truth. "In the day thou eate&s;t thereof, thou &s;halt &s;urely die." Let the &s;en&s;e be allowed as in the paraphra&s;e: viz. "In the day thou eate&s;t of the forbidden fruit, thou &s;halt be|come mortal, even thou Adam, and all human nature now in thee. Thy &s;oul al&s;o, &s;hall &s;u&s;tain great damage and unhappine&s;s, that is, &s;piritual death, in &s;ome awful de|gree, without the lea&s;t ground of hope that the ca&s;e &s;hall ever become any better with thee, (with the human kind,) to endle&s;s du|ration. Be a&s;&s;ured of no felicity for thee; nothing better than &s;orrow and woe; or, at the utmo&s;t, no greater relief than ex|tinction of being." I grant this explanation of the words, at pre&s;ent, for two rea&s;ons; the one is, it is certainly true as far as it extends; though it by no means compre|hends the whole: And the other is, becau&s;e all that regard the word of God, will ac|quie&s;ce
<PB N="30" REF="030609_0029_0FE82C03AD71F110">
in it thus far, while mo&s;t will carry it much further. It will plainly appear, that whether this, or the more common idea be taken from the words, it will have one and the &s;ame a&s;pect, in &s;upport of the fol|lowing argument: Ina&s;much as there can be nothing plainer than that the threatening never did fully take place, on <HI>mere man</HI> in his own per&s;on, and never will; and that God never de&s;igned it as the <HI>voice of certain fact,</HI> on mere man; but as the voice of pure ju&s;tice alone.</P>
<P>I HOPE, that I cannot be mi&s;under&s;tood in the u&s;e of the&s;e phra&s;es, "<HI>the voice of ju&s;tice,</HI>" and "<HI>the voice of fact;</HI>" or, "<HI>lan|guage of law,</HI> and <HI>language of go&s;pel,</HI>" with re&s;pect to man: Or, "<HI>what ought in ju&s;tice to be done, and what, in God's &s;overeign mercy, harmonizing with ju&s;tice, &s;hall be done.</HI>" I can think of no terms more accurate, and I find the di&s;tinction frequent among civilians and divines, viz. "<HI>De jure, and de facto,</HI>" which di&s;tinction has been found nece&s;&s;ary in many ca&s;es; and is, as will appear throughout the whole of this e&s;&s;ay, quite e&s;&s;ential to a right under&s;tanding of divine revelation, or even maintaining it with any po&s;&s;ible con|&s;i&s;tency.</P>
<P>NOW if any will &s;ay, that the threatening did take place on the day of the rebellion, <HI>in full,</HI> according to the plain &s;en&s;e in which God made Adam to under&s;tand him, when he uttered the words; or agreeable to pure ju&s;tice in the law alone, or ever will take place, on mere mankind per&s;onally, or ju&s;t
<PB N="31" REF="030609_0030_0FE82C061ACA3B08">
as Adam expected; their minds are, at pre|&s;ent, not in a condition to be rea&s;oned with. God had a mo&s;t glorious and merciful re|&s;erve in his own mind, on the preconcerted plan of eternal, redeeming wi&s;dom and love, which he did not communicate to man when he placed him under his holy law; and which he did begin to intimate "in the cool of the day," at the very time when Adam expected the full threatening would have taken place. There was no other po&s;&s;ible way for God to have &s;u&s;|pended the immediate execution of it, con|&s;i&s;tent with his own mo&s;t holy nature and character. He had provided a way, in which all he had &s;aid, might and certainly would be verified on man in a <HI>vicar,</HI> a <HI>&s;ub|&s;titute,</HI> a <HI>&s;econd Adam,</HI> or covenant head, in <HI>due time</HI> to be dignified by per&s;onal union with the eternal LOGOS, or WORD. That, on him, the whole weight of the cur&s;e &s;hould fall, vindicating the truth of Deity in threatening, though never executed on mere man as Adam expected, and as the plain <HI>voice of ju&s;tice</HI> denounced; which A|dam then thought was in&s;eparable from the <HI>voice of fact;</HI> having not the lea&s;t intima|tion, when he was placed under the holy law, that there could ever be any &s;eparation of <HI>pure ju&s;tice,</HI> from <HI>very fact,</HI> with regard to man: Nor would any man, or any angel ever have thought of &s;uch a di&s;tinction; or any po&s;&s;ible way to make it, con&s;i&s;tent with the immutable truth of God, if God him|&s;elf had not contrived and revealed it. Here
<PB N="32" REF="030609_0031_0FE82C0B9B3BB9B8">
we have the two grand pillars of divine revelation. God di&s;played in an <HI>ab&s;olute character,</HI> without any intimation of a me|diator; this is moral law and all-glorious. And God di&s;played to man in a mediator; this is go&s;pel, <HI>pure go&s;pel,</HI> and exceedeth in glory.</P>
<P>IN a right under&s;tanding of the&s;e grand points, we are led into a harmonious, and con&s;i&s;tent view of the whole word of God. We find the law and the go&s;pel di&s;played &s;ide by &s;ide, through the whole. The law every where &s;ounds with awful terror in ac|cents of pure ju&s;tice, towards man, without a Savior. The go&s;pel is all mere news, and good news, glad tidings, through a medi|ator, which man would never have heard or thought of, if God had not made the pro|clamation. The moral law every where &s;peaks to man in his own per&s;onal character; the go&s;pel in that of the Me&s;&s;iah. The law tells what man in ju&s;tice de&s;erves, in his own per&s;onal character; the go&s;pel, what the Son of man, the Son of God de&s;erves, and that he is by divine con&s;titution "a covenant for the people, and God's &s;alvation to the ends of the earth;" and that the head of <HI>every man</HI> is Chri&s;t. This intimation be|gan on the day of the rebellion, and at that time was but dark, and for wi&s;e rea&s;ons, which will appear in the &s;equel.</P>
<P>THE divine law enjoining perfect obe|dience, on pain of endle&s;s mi&s;ery, runs through the whole of divine revelation from beginning to end; and &s;o does the go&s;pel,
<PB N="33" REF="030609_0032_0FE82B7BCDA057A0">
exhibiting a &s;alvation fully tantamount. There is as much of the go&s;pel in the old te&s;tament as in the new; and as much of the law in the new te&s;tament as in the old. The latter di&s;pen&s;ation hath the whole &s;ub|&s;tance of the former, and nothing for the <HI>matter</HI> of it new: The former hath, in like manner, the whole of the latter, and nothing for &s;ub&s;tance has ever been done away, or ever will be, until the my&s;tery of God &s;hall be fini&s;hed. The new te&s;tament is only a new edition of the old, in much greater clearne&s;s.</P>
<P>FOUR things are obvious in the grand de&s;ign of divine revelation, viz. To mani|fe&s;t, and hold clearly in our view the ab|&s;olute and rectoral character of God. The character of fallen man. His duty. And God's eternal, fixed and gracious purpo&s;e concerning him, through the whole of his interminable exi&s;tence. The three former of the&s;e pertain to the law of God; the la&s;t to the go&s;pel; and is all pure go&s;pel, or good news.</P>
<P>IN the law we &s;ee God's all-glorious, and infinitely perfect character as law giver; as al&s;o the infinitely hateful, and mo&s;t abo|minable <HI>moral character</HI> of fallen man; and the rea&s;onable duty of man to be wholly conformed to the moral image of God, and keep his whole law, without any deficiency; and what he de&s;erves, and what the voice of ju&s;tice is concerning him, if he is found wanting in the lea&s;t. "Cur&s;ed is every one

<P>NOW this manife&s;tation of God, and of man's duty, and his guilt, runs through the whole bible, old and new te&s;tament; ju&s;t as much in the one as in the other; but much more con&s;picuous, for the <HI>manner of di&s;co|very</HI> in the latter.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, the go&s;pel begins in the third chapter of divine revelation, (as the law does in the &s;econd,) and runs through all the old te&s;tament, in types, figures, prophecies, &amp;c.

his contra&s;ted anti-type Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as is mo&s;t evident from Rom. chap. 5, and many other parts of &s;acred &s;cripture. Thus it was in Noah, Gen. chap. 9, and with Abra|ham, Gen. 17. And with David as a type of Chri&s;t, P&s;al. 89. Never, &s;ince the fall, can any individual take hold of any promi&s;e of &s;piritual good, but in a foederal way; and certainly the grand cur&s;e including in it virtually all other cur&s;es, came in this way: As the reader will &s;ee to full demon|&s;tation in its proper place.</P>
<P>IT has been ob&s;erved before, that God keeps up the language of ju&s;tice towards man in his awful guilt. He keeps the voice of &s;trict ju&s;tice &s;ounding in his ears, through the whole book of divine revelation, and that, no doubt, that man may know and feel what he is, and have an heart to receive the voice of grace, <HI>as grace;</HI> or feeling him&s;elf infinitely vile, may bid a becoming welcome to mere, &s;overeign mercy. The law &s;peaks in righteou&s;ne&s;s; every where denounces what is <HI>ju&s;t</HI> and <HI>equal</HI> towards man. It thunders aloud the true de&s;ert of man. But it &s;peaks not what &s;hall <HI>in fact</HI> take place on man, and his &s;urety both; or <HI>on man at all,</HI> in faith and union with Chri&s;t; or any otherwi&s;e than in his &s;urety; any more than the original cur&s;e did, in the garden of Eden, which was noticed before. Yet it is manife&s;t, that the wi&s;dom of God &s;aw fit, for a time, to leave man in &s;uch igno|rance and darkne&s;s of mind, that he &s;hould mi&s;take that which was &s;poken only as the
<PB N="36" REF="030609_0035_0FE82BB6A79525F0">
<HI>voice of ju&s;tice,</HI> for a declaration of <HI>very fact,</HI> which &s;hould inevitably come upon him&s;elf. Man mo&s;t naturally fell into this mi&s;under|&s;tanding, from the inward &s;en&s;e of horrible guilt, in his own &s;oul, and &s;o was exerci&s;ed with great torment, in a way of &s;ervile fear. Great &s;en&s;e of guilt will make an object of fear which hath no other exi&s;tence; "the wicked fear where no fear is."</P>
<P>IT is not for man to account for all the rea&s;ons of the divine conduct, though it is well for us, with humble adoration, to go as far in this way as we can. It is a certain fact, however, that God hath cho&s;en to give light and comfort to mi&s;erable, blind &s;in|ners of mankind, by &s;low degrees.</P>
<P>THERE was &s;ome light, &s;ome comfort, derived to our fir&s;t parents from what they heard God &s;ay to the &s;erpent, relative to the oppo&s;ite &s;eed, and the victory announced. The law, and the go&s;pel were both promul|gated in paradi&s;e. The voice of law then &s;ounded much the loude&s;t; but it has been the manife&s;t will of heaven, that the &s;ound of the go&s;pel &s;hould gradually gain upon that of the law, from that day to the fini&s;h|ing of the my&s;tery of God.</P>
<P>BY the in&s;titution and import of &s;acri|fices in paradi&s;e, and cloathing the naked, &s;hameful, pair in their &s;kins; and by the &s;a|crifices continued down to the flood; and by the preaching of Enoch and Noah; and by oral in&s;tructions, &amp;c. the light and com|fort of divine grace had &s;ome gradual in|crea&s;e, while the law, as we know, &s;till
<PB N="37" REF="030609_0036_0FE82C14B06B0500">
&s;ounded very terrible. See the epi&s;tle of Jude.</P>
<P>BY the type of the ark; the &s;alvation of the church therein; the covenant made with all mankind in Noah; and by the rainbow as a token &s;ealing the whole, the good report was con&s;iderably louder and clearer than ever before.</P>
<P>IN the covenant made with Abraham, the light of the go&s;pel increa&s;ed. For all, of this nature, was <HI>very go&s;pel</HI> from the fir&s;t; <HI>in nature</HI> the &s;ame with that preached after the de&s;cent of the Holy Gho&s;t at penteco&s;t, only much more ob&s;cure, in <HI>manner</HI> and <HI>de|gree.</HI> God's promi&s;e of a &s;on to that patri|arch, to be given in &s;uch a wonderful way; and of the <HI>church,</HI> a <HI>numerous &s;eed,</HI> through him; the promi&s;e of the land of Canaan, &amp;c. all gave further in&s;truction, with re|gard to that mo&s;t intere&s;ting concern of man, the redemption and &s;alvation of the guilty &s;oul.</P>
<P>AT the giving of the law on mount Sinai, and the in&s;titution of all the rites and &s;acri|fices of the mo&s;aic oeconomy, both law and go&s;pel were made much plainer than before: the moral law, or ten commandments, to enlighten and awaken God's people, teach them their duty, convince them of their awful deficiency, the ju&s;tice of their con|demnation, and their utter impotency and ab&s;olute dependance on God: And the ce|remonial law, all the rituals, &s;acrifices, types and &s;hadows, pointing to Chri&s;t, the great anti-type, "the end of the law for righteou&s;|ne&s;s,
<PB N="38" REF="030609_0037_0FE82C171AD54B10">
to every one that believeth." This exhibited the go&s;pel, or doctrine of atone|ment and free grace, with increa&s;ing per&s;pi|cuity; and is well called "a &s;chool-ma&s;ter to bring us to Chri&s;t."</P>
<P>FROM this time down to the fulne&s;s of time, in which Chri&s;t came, God &s;ent among his people a great number of prophets, every one of whom ca&s;t &s;ome light on the law, and gave &s;ome further knowledge of the go&s;pel. Among the&s;e, David, I&s;aiah, and Daniel, were very eminent. The light of divine revelation, both law and go&s;pel, was much augmented, by John the harbin|ger of Chri&s;t. The Me&s;&s;iah in his own per|&s;on, doctrines, deeds, and &s;ufferings, made the whole will of God, relating to a guilty world, the methods of his grace, and all the purpo&s;es of his love, &s;till far more con&s;pi|cuous; &s;o clearly expre&s;&s;ive, that "his name is well called <HI>the word of God.</HI>"</P>
<P>THE light of the &s;ame go&s;pel which had been, by degrees, exhibited from the days of paradi&s;e, was much increa&s;ed in the apo&s;|tolic times, by the more abundant effu&s;ion of the holy &s;pirit; by the preaching of the apo&s;tles, far and wide; by their writings, filling up the &s;acred canon. So that the lea&s;t teacher under this <HI>new di&s;pen&s;ation,</HI> was better in&s;tructed than the greate&s;t under the <HI>old;</HI> and under&s;tood the doctrines of the kingdom of heaven, better than John the promi&s;ed Elias. Matt. xi.</P>
<P>AND, when the go&s;pel door was &s;et open to <HI>all nations</HI> of the earth, as well as to the
<PB N="39" REF="030609_0038_0FE82C1E57BED3B0">
<HI>Jews,</HI> the doctrine was &s;o &s;trange, &s;o far be|yond all the notions of grace and &s;alvation, ever entertained among the covenant people of God; and &s;o exceedingly mortifying to the pride of their hearts, that it was ab|horred and rejected. Ju&s;t as it now would be, &s;hould one a&s;&s;ert in the mo&s;t obvious and plaine&s;t &s;en&s;e, that "God will have all men to be &s;aved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth:" Or, as if a mo|dern believer &s;hould a&s;&s;ert without any con|&s;truction of his own, and with all the &s;im|plicity of an old patriarch, that Chri&s;t died, "not for our &s;ins only, but al&s;o for the &s;ins of the WHOLE WORLD." Indeed, when Je&s;us fir&s;t gave this intimation, they who had ju&s;t been gazing at him with plea&s;ing wonder, were &s;o chagrined at the idea that a whole world of <HI>heathen dogs</HI> &s;hould be &s;et on a footing, as re&s;pectable as them&s;elves, that they wi&s;hed him nothing better than in&s;tant death. Luke iv. They could not bear the thought of lo&s;ing their fancied monopoly, on which they &s;o much valued them&s;elves.</P>
<P>THE motive, why the Jews were more malicious per&s;ecutors of Chri&s;t, and the primitive chri&s;tians, than other men, was quite natural to all mankind. It was not becau&s;e they were wor&s;e than other men, or more malicious by nature; but they had been &s;o long honored of God, and di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by peculiar <HI>privileges,</HI> that they felt <HI>them</HI> in their hearts as a monopoly: Even as a man de&s;cended from an ancient, noble family, has no idea that it is fit, in the
<PB N="40" REF="030609_0039_0FE82C1FE0C2F298">
cour&s;e of providence, that the children of beggars immemorial, &s;hould ever become as rich and noble as him&s;elf and his po&s;terity. This is human nature in every age. Any doctrine, that will place poor, &s;hameful creatures, who have in time pa&s;t been mo&s;t neglected of God, in the holy, &s;overeign di&s;pen&s;ation of his providence, on a level with us, with regard to grace and favor yet to come; and would break down all bar|riers which inclo&s;e us in the palaces of di&s;|tinction and honor, will &s;et on our hearts, ju&s;t as <HI>like</HI> doctrines did on the hearts of the favored children of Abraham, in days of yore.</P>
<P>IT has plea&s;ed infinite wi&s;dom, however, to cau&s;e the light of &s;alvation to increa&s;e, down to the pre&s;ent day; though not in eve|ry age, or every period of time alike. There have been remarkable aeras, in which &s;ome|thing like a flood of light has poured into the world, and, at certain times, darkne&s;s and ignorance have rather gained ground. But, on an average, light hath been growing, in all &s;ciences; and the light of the go&s;pel, the light of &s;alvation in particular.</P>
<P>I HAVE already ob&s;erved remarkable pe|riods and di&s;pen&s;ations, down to the clo&s;e of the &s;acred canon. After that, there was a gradual increa&s;e of knowledge for about three hundred years. Then, for a time, the darkne&s;s in general, &s;eemed to gain upon the light; and &s;ometimes gro&s;s darkne&s;s &s;eemed as if it would over&s;pread the world. Yet God kept up, in his church, &s;ome lumi|naries
<PB N="41" REF="030609_0040_0FE82C264BAA9280">
at all times. There never pa&s;&s;ed one century, without &s;ome great, godly, learned man who, perhaps advanced &s;omewhat fur|ther than his fathers; witne&s;s the Wal|den&s;es, and Albigen&s;es, in the darke&s;t pe|riod; al&s;o, <HI>Hu&s;s, Luther, Calvin,</HI> &amp;c. And, &s;ince the days of the&s;e eminent luminaries, there has been an unremitting advancement of knowledge. I believe I may &s;ay, not one year has elap&s;ed without &s;ome increa&s;e of go&s;pel light, as well as of every other &s;cience. "Many &s;hall run to and fro, and knowledge &s;hall be increa&s;ed."</P>
<P>THE la&s;t, and pre&s;ent centuries have been productive of many great and learned inquirers after truth, who have been happily &s;ucce&s;sful. At the head of them we may place, in Europe, the incomparable <HI>Owen,</HI> and, in America, the immortal <HI>Edwards</HI>; men of the &s;ame turn of mind, and much the &s;ame channel of thinking. The&s;e men gra&s;ped the whole circle of &s;cience in a re|markable manner. And, by the way, every careful reader will &s;ee, that they held all the foundation principles of &s;alvation, on which this <HI>treati&s;e</HI> is &s;upported, ju&s;t as I do; though they drew not the &s;ame con&s;equen|ces, however fully and fairly implied: And like all others, that have advanced forward and beat the way, they met with va&s;t oppo|&s;ition. For the moral world is like the natural; he that breaks up new ground, meets with great re&s;i&s;tance from the hard bound, &s;tubborn &s;oil; after a few years cultivation, the plough runs ea&s;y.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="030609_0041_0FE82C27D5FC1510">I MAY now further con&s;ider the law, and the go&s;pel. They were fir&s;t promulgated, as I have &s;aid, very near together, in the gar|den of Eden, and they run through all the &s;acred oracles. <HI>&s;ide by &s;ide.</HI> God keeps them both, every where, in full view; yet they are as di&s;tinct in their natures as any two things in the univer&s;e.</P>
<P>WHATEVER is law, where&s;oever found in &s;acred &s;cripture, is a rule of ab&s;olute per|fection, as high as the natures of moral a|gents can ri&s;e, in heart and conduct; on &s;uppo&s;ition they are wholly without any moral di&s;order, any want of perfect holine&s;s, in the temper of their minds. This law every where denounces the infinite and ever|la&s;ting wrath of God, and endle&s;s mi&s;ery to man, in ca&s;e of the lea&s;t failure. The law knows nothing of mercy, or of mitigation. This is law, and it is "holy, ju&s;t, and good."</P>
<P>THE go&s;pel, on whatever page of &s;acred writ it is found, either in the old te&s;tament or new; whether in types, &s;acrifices, pro|phecies, epi&s;tles, or any other way; knows nothing at all of mi&s;ery, or torment, or the puni&s;hment of any creature under heaven, I &s;hould have &s;aid, <HI>any mere creature.</HI> It &s;peaks much of the di&s;tre&s;s, &s;orrow, pain, and puni&s;hment, of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, God-man; by the appointment of the Father, and his own free con&s;ent, &s;et apart to &s;uffer and die for the &s;ins of the <HI>whole world;</HI> the anti-type of all the types in the ancient church; "the lamb &s;lain from the foundation of the
<PB N="43" REF="030609_0042_0FE82C2E483B96F8">
world!" "The Lamb of God that taketh away the &s;in of the world." On this one head, the go&s;pel tells us of ju&s;t as much "indignation and wrath, tribulation and angui&s;h," as the whole law of God does from the beginning to the end of the bible. But, as to any mere man, the go&s;pel &s;ays not one uncomfortable word; quite the rever&s;e. Every word is a word of comfort, it is every where "<HI>glad tidings</HI> of great joy, which &s;hall be to <HI>all people.</HI>" So Je&s;us as the prince of peace, and as the great preacher of it, and as mediator between God and &s;inners, &s;ays, "do not think that I will accu&s;e you to the Father; there is one that accu&s;eth you, even Mo&s;es in whom ye tru&s;t."</P>
<P>THE voice of the whole law, and the voice of the go&s;pel, are exceedingly di&s;tinct, and diametrically oppo&s;ite. The <HI>law demands perfection; cur&s;es for want of it; and cries vengeance.</HI> The GOSPEL <HI>points out perfection; highly approves of it, and the imputation of it;</HI> and PROCLAIMS SALVATION. The law &s;ays do well, and thou &s;halt live. The go&s;pel &s;ays thou <HI>&s;halt</HI> live, becau&s;e Chri&s;t lives, and &s;halt do well. The moral law is no news at all; it is what our rea&s;on dictates and approves. The go&s;pel is all news. We never &s;hould have thought of it, had it not come in a way of tidings from heaven. It is all <HI>good news</HI>; and there is not one word of <HI>bad news</HI> in it.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign">, may be bad as well as good; but <GAP DESC="foreign">, cannot be bad.</NOTE> It is all good news to &s;in|ners,

to creatures that might never have ex|pected a word of that kind. It is wholly glad tidings to hell de&s;erving rebels, who could expect from God no tidings but very bad; even as bad as their nature and ways, and as horrible as all their guilt.</P>
<P>HENCE it appears, that, when we are told of a <HI>go&s;pel law,</HI> the meaning (to make any &s;en&s;e of it) mu&s;t be the law &s;poken of in Jer. xxxi. 31, &amp;c. and afterwards quoted by the apo&s;tle, Heb. viii. Even a living prin|ciple of obedience, wrought and excited by under&s;tanding and believing the go&s;pel; which will ever be the ca&s;e, as will appear in the &s;equel. But, in a &s;trict and proper &s;en&s;e of the phra&s;e, (which is however not found in the bible) a <HI>go&s;pel law</HI> &s;ignifies the con|demning <HI>power of good news</HI>: Which, at be&s;t, carries an odd &s;ound with it.</P>
<P>THE go&s;pel tells us of the mo&s;t important facts; things of infinite weight and everla&s;t|ing importance; and things, in all re&s;pects, as independent of us, as any things we ever heard of tran&s;acted in <HI>A&s;ia.</HI> The news that comes from heaven, is as independent of us, as if we &s;hould this day hear &s;ome news from the planet Saturn, well atte&s;ted. All news makes its way into our minds, and commands our belief; not according to our choice, but, by the weight of its own evi|dence. Thus it is with this emphatically, <HI>good news.</HI> God brings it to our &s;ouls with evidence enough when he plea&s;es, and it has its effect, according to its nature and im|portance, as all other information has: The
<PB N="45" REF="030609_0044_0FE82B7E30259790">
heart being fir&s;t prepared by almighty power.</P>
<P>IT appears fit and worthy of God, to keep his law every where in our &s;ight, in his revealed will; that we may &s;ee the true character of Jehovah; and our own char|acter; and our whole duty; with the ju&s;t con&s;equences of departing from it, ever endle&s;s mi&s;ery, as great as our natures are capable of. Rebellion again&s;t &s;uch a God, violation of &s;uch obligations, ju&s;tly merits <HI>this,</HI> or <HI>nothing.</HI></P>
<P>IF our obligations to obedience, are not infinite; God is not a Being of infinite perfection and worthine&s;s. To a&s;&s;ert which, is equal to athei&s;m; for if there is not &s;uch a God, there is none. Our &s;in can be an infinite evil only in one &s;en&s;e; as oppo&s;ed to a Being of infinite perfection: For finite natures are not capable of di&s;po&s;itions, or deeds infinite in them&s;elves. Our puni&s;h|ment can be infinite only in one &s;en&s;e, viz. endle&s;s duration: For finite natures are not capable of infinite pain, in any given time.</P>
<P>THUS, endle&s;s duration of torment, ap|pears obviou&s;ly ju&s;t; no more than we de|&s;erve; and not in the lea&s;t cruel for God to inflict. Should we, <HI>in fact,</HI> fall under it, every mouth would be &s;topped, and every &s;oul would be convinced of &s;uch guilt be|fore God, as to render this puni&s;hment equal, in rea&s;on and ju&s;tice. And this mu&s;t have been our doom, if another had not, by divine appointment, come in our place.
<PB N="46" REF="030609_0045_0FE82BD35EF2BAC0">
Now, as I hinted before, it is nece&s;&s;ary that we know and feel this conviction, deep in our own &s;ouls, that we may receive <HI>grace</HI> as <HI>grace;</HI> and have proper impre&s;&s;ions affecting all the powers of our &s;ouls, in the reception of mere, &s;overeign, <HI>infinite mercy.</HI></P>
<P>TO argue, as &s;ome do, that it is not <HI>ju&s;t</HI> for God to puni&s;h us eternally, for tran&s;ient &s;ins in this world, is the perfection of ab|&s;urdity; and ari&s;es from a total ignorance of God and our&s;elves, in the true character and relation of each.</P>
<P>WE proceed now to con&s;ult the word of God a little more attentively: Not what we imagine God ought to have &s;aid; but what he hath verily &s;aid. The &s;acred ora|cles came from God, and he hath &s;aid in them a great many things, which we &s;hould not have put in, had we made a bible. Many things in it appear, not only above my rea&s;on, but as oppo&s;ite to it, as my command does to my little children when I tell them not to eat a certain fruit, which to them appears exceedingly plea&s;ant, and greatly excites their appetites, and they have no &s;en&s;e of any harm in it, though I know it is poi&s;on. Or, when I bid them go to &s;chool, and not play, when, <HI>to all their &s;en&s;e and under&s;tanding,</HI> play is far more eligible.</P>
<P>THEY, who read &s;acred &s;cripture, only with a view to make it &s;peak what they judge it ought to &s;peak, and that, after they have owned that it came from God, &s;eem to me rather wanting in common &s;en&s;e, or

hone&s;ty. I am quite &s;atisfied with what God has &s;aid, in its plaine&s;t meaning; and as well &s;atisfied with it, if it is quite above my rea&s;on, as if it is otherwi&s;e. Yea, if wholly oppo&s;ite to my be&s;t rea&s;onings, I only thence infer my own ignorance and weakne&s;s, and fully believe and obey my God: even as I will have my little children believe what I tell them, and do what I bid them, though extremely contrary to their puerile ignorance and perver&s;ene&s;s.

They, therefore, who would deny that the endle&s;s damnation of &s;inners, is fully a&s;&s;erted in the word of God, are unfair in their rea&s;onings and critici&s;ms. Be&s;ide, all common &s;en&s;e indicates that if &s;inners de&s;erve any puni&s;hment, they de&s;erve an endle&s;s one. Their mi&s;ery will be as ever|la&s;ting as the happine&s;s of the &s;aints, and is expre&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame words, Matt. xxv. Here it is plainly declared, that when final judgment is clo&s;ed, they &s;hall then "go away into everla&s;ting puni&s;hment."</P>
<P>AGAIN; does the bible plainly tell us that <HI>all the human race &s;hall certainly be &s;aved,</HI> and be happy forever, through the merits, power, and faithfulne&s;s of the Son of God? <HI>It does; as fully and plainly, as it is po&s;&s;ible for any language to expre&s;s; and that in &s;everal places.</HI> John i. 29. "Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the &s;in of the

world." John iii. 17. "For God &s;ent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; BUT THAT THE WORLD THROUGH HIM MIGHT BE SAVED." John iv. 42. "&mdash;the Chri&s;t, the Savior of the world." John vi. 33. "For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world." John xii. 47. "And if any man hear my words and believe not, I judge him not: For I came not to judge the world, but to &s;ave the world." 1. John ii. 2. "And he is the propitiation for our &s;ins: And not for ours only, but al&s;o for the SINS OF THE WHOLE WORLD." 1. John iv. 14. "And we have &s;een and do te&s;tify, that the Father &s;ent the Son to be the Savior of the world." All the&s;e are taken from only one of the &s;acred writers. It is certain, neither he, nor any other man could have &s;poken plainer, on &s;uppo&s;ition his only intention was, to a&s;&s;ert the final &s;alvation of every human creature. And never any per|&s;on in the world, would have thought of putting a different con&s;truction on any of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, had it not been for a previous opinion, fully &s;ettled, that &s;inners of the human race &s;hall per&s;onally, not vicariou&s;ly be damned to all eternity. They build on as plain &s;cripture a&s;&s;ertions as are in the power of language, <HI>in ca&s;e a vicar or &s;ub&s;ti|tute be excluded.</HI> But per&s;onal mi&s;ery being a truth not in the lea&s;t to be examined or &s;crupled by them; they have put a con|&s;truction on whatever is expre&s;sly oppo&s;ite,
<PB N="50" REF="030609_0049_0FE82C3466E5DAF0">
as foreign to plain, common under&s;tanding, as the power of &s;ophi&s;try can invent. Not knowing any other way to make the whole of the bible true: It being referred by in|finite wi&s;dom to later times; at lea&s;t to be uttered with le&s;s re&s;erve than in former times.</P>
<P>BESIDES plain a&s;&s;ertions, as direct and brief as words are capable of, the doctrine of the per&s;onal &s;alvation of all men is clearly taught more at large, and quite as fully, in many parts of divine revelation; if we will only attend to them with a fair unbia&s;&s;ed mind.</P>
<P>WE &s;hould be likely to conclude, that if the people of <HI>Sodom,</HI> are finally &s;aved, all &s;inners will be; but their final &s;alvation is fully a&s;&s;erted, though not as the ancient peo|ple of God under&s;tood the covenant of re|demption and grace. Ezek. xvi. 53. "When I &s;hall bring again their captivity, the capti|vity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, then will I bring again the captivity of thy cap|tives in the mid&s;t of them." Ver. 60, to the end of the chapter. "Neverthele&s;s, I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will e&s;tabli&s;h unto thee an everla&s;ting covenant. Then thou &s;halt remember thy ways, and be a&s;hamed, when thou &s;halt receive thy &s;i&s;ters thine el|der and thy younger: And I will give them unto thee for daughters; but not by thy cov|enant. And I will e&s;tabli&s;h my covenant with thee; and thou SHALT know that I am the LORD: That thou maye&s;t remember and
<PB N="51" REF="030609_0050_0FE82C37E3922BB0">
be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more becau&s;e of thy &s;hame, when I am pacified toward thee for all that thou ha&s;t done, &s;aith the Lord God."</P>
<P>AND though, in the true &s;en&s;e of di|vine revelation they &s;uffer the vengeance of eternal fire, as all &s;inners mu&s;t; yet in this chapter it is plain enough, without any comment, that infinite, &s;overeign power and grace will finally triumph over the utmo&s;t guilt and wretchedne&s;s of Sodom. Not as man had thought; not as the Jews had ever under&s;tood the covenant of redeeming love. "NOT BY THY COVENANT."</P>
<P>IN the prophet I&s;aiah, &s;alvation is fairly extended as far as the human race extend. Read chap. xi. and his prophecy at large. So it is in &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages in the other pro|phets. The point may be fairly inferred from the prophet, where God expre&s;sly tells us his will and di&s;po&s;ition is the damnation of none, but the &s;alvation of all: Since we know that by his own Son every ob&s;tacle, every claim of ju&s;tice, every po&s;&s;ibility of &s;taining his own character, by &s;aving whom he will, is wholly removed out of the way. Ezek. xxxiii. 11. "Say unto them, as I live, &s;aith the Lord GOD, I HAVE NO PLEA|SURE in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live: Turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die O hou&s;e of I&s;rael?"</P>
<P>WHAT would I have more, to &s;ecure my &s;alvation, than the infinite power, infinite benevolence, and expre&s;s will of God: Be|ing
<PB N="52" REF="030609_0051_0FE82C3C77610C38">
a&s;&s;ured, by the &s;ame God, that he can &s;ave me if he will, fully con&s;i&s;tent with his own honor, and glory; or that the way is clear and open, in and through Chri&s;t, for his infinite good will and all his attributes natural and moral, to be everted and di&s;|played to the highe&s;t advantage in my &s;al|vation? I take this rea&s;oning from Paul. When he would engage as in the great duty of prayer, for the &s;alvation of all men, heathen per&s;ecuting kings, and all men in authority, though many of their hands were daily &s;tained with the blood of the &s;aints; he tells the church, they had a good founda|tion to pray for the final &s;alvation of &s;uch men, and every vile-&s;inner, on the face of the earth. It is that which is the only foun|dation of all our &s;aith, and all our prayer; the expre&s;s <HI>will of God.</HI> 1. Tim. ii. at the beginning. Paul in the &s;ixth ver&s;e tells us, that the time infinite wi&s;dom had appointed for a free preaching, and a general under|&s;tanding of this glorious doctrine, was future. "<HI>To be te&s;tified in due time.</HI>"</P>
<P>HE well under&s;tood God's wi&s;e method of gradation, in giving light and comfort to &s;uch mi&s;erable &s;inners&punc; In the ca&s;e of a poor, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed criminal, condemned to die, and &s;huddering at his impending fate; if there is a pardon for him, through the mer|cy of the Judge, it is kind to open to him the good news gradually; le&s;t the &s;udden &s;hock be too mighty for him. Paul had no direc|tion from his ma&s;ter to &s;peak out clearly all he knew to be true; therefore he ordinarily
<PB N="53" REF="030609_0052_0FE82C3EE4BB4260">
u&s;ed milk, and not &s;trong meat; though he had great &s;tore of it.</P>
<P>IN the fifth chapter to the Romans, Paul &s;ets up Adam and Chri&s;t, each as a foederal head of the human kind, as plainly as words can expre&s;s; and repeatedly declares, that &s;alvation by Chri&s;t &s;hall be quite as exten|&s;ive, as ruin by Adam. No man in the world would ever have thought of any other con&s;truction of that chapter, had it not been for an antecedent, &s;ettled preju|dice, that mo&s;t of the human race &s;hall cer|tainly he damned <HI>in their own per&s;ons.</HI> Any one that will read the chapter, dive&s;ted of &s;uch a prejudice of mind, will acknowledge the above repre&s;entation is indi&s;putable. But what will not a firm, fixed prejudice do? It will even make us &s;ay, that "<HI>all men,</HI>" &s;ignifies <HI>a few men;</HI> and that "<HI>much more,</HI>" means <HI>much le&s;s.</HI> Or it will lead us to read the 21&s;t ver&s;e thus, "That as &s;in hath reigned unto death, even &s;o might grace NOT reign, through righteou&s;ne&s;s, unto eternal life, by Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord."</P>
<P>I HAVE no idea that Paul could have &s;poken plainer than he did, 2. Cor. v. On &s;uppo&s;ition his de&s;ign had been to announce the final &s;alvation of all men, through the almighty power, and grace of God, and the infinite merits of Chri&s;t. 2. Cor. v. ver&s;e 18, to the end. "And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to him&s;elf by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and hath given to us the mini&s;try of reconciliation; to wit, that God was in Chri&s;t, RECONCILING THE
<PB N="54" REF="030609_0053_0FE82C44940029B8">
WORLD UNTO HIMSELF, NOT IMPUTING THEIR TRESPASSES UNTO THEM; and hath committed unto us the word of reconcilia|tion. Now then we are amba&s;&s;adors for Chri&s;t, as though God did be&s;eech you by us: We pray you in Chri&s;t's &s;tead, be ye reconciled to God. For he hath made him to be &s;in for us, who knew no &s;in; that we might be made the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God in him." No man can make a comment on this; for no words can make the pa&s;&s;age plainer. Here is the all-&s;ufficient atone|ment; here is the infinite love of God, and his grace and mercy infinitely free, his purpo&s;e fixed, and his power wholly irre|&s;i&s;tible; and all &s;o of God, that no crea|ture, nothing found in any creature, can in the lea&s;t &s;et a&s;ide his immutable decree.</P>
<P>I HAVE di&s;cour&s;ed with &s;everal that be|lieved in the &s;overeign grace of God, in the wide&s;t extent; but never &s;aw one that was able to expre&s;s the idea with &s;o much pre|ci&s;ion, per&s;picuity and maje&s;ty, as Paul does, Colo&s;&s;. i. 19, &amp;c. "For it plea&s;ed the Father, that in him &s;hould all fulne&s;s dwell; and (having made peace through the blood of his cro&s;s) by him to reconcile ALL THINGS unto him&s;elf; by him, I &s;ay, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven. And you that were &s;ometime alienated, and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his fle&s;h through death, to pre&s;ent you holy and unblameable, and un|reproveable in his &s;ight: If ye continue in
<PB N="55" REF="030609_0054_0FE82C47ED011670">
the faith grounded and &s;ettled, and be not moved away from the hope of the go&s;pel, which ye have heard, and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a mini|&s;ter." Per&s;everance is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alva|tion; that we know. God will take care of that. Le&s;t there &s;hould be a po&s;&s;ible idea of limitation, Paul a&s;&s;ures us, that this go&s;|pel "was preached to every creature which is under heaven," i. e. to all <HI>mankind;</HI> every other creature receiving as much ad|vantage by <HI>their</HI> &s;alvation, as di&s;advantage by <HI>their</HI> apo&s;tacy. And this is explanatory of Rom. viii. 19,&mdash;23. where the whole lower creation appears groaning under the total lap&s;e of human nature, and obtaining full deliverance, in the univer&s;al re&s;toration of the human kind.</P>
<P>IT is exceedingly clear, that all who hear the go&s;pel, are commanded to believe it; that all who believe it, have life eternal, and have a witne&s;s of their title thereunto, on their believing; that their believing, does not make the foundation of their faith and &s;alvation more true than it was before; but their faith is built on previous truth. This is the foundation, which neither faith nor infidelity in man, had any hand in laying, or can have any power to remove. For "if we believe not, yet he abideth faithful; he cannot deny him&s;elf." 2. Tim. ii. 13.</P>
<P>IF we do not believe that to be true, the belief of which centers in a &s;ure title to
<PB N="56" REF="030609_0055_0FE82C4E4B5B3230">
&s;alvation, we make God a liar. Any man in the world does this, that does not be|lieve. But if God had not laid a &s;ure foundation, for the &s;ure eternal life of <HI>all; &s;ome</HI> would make him true in <HI>not believing;</HI> and a liar in <HI>believing</HI> it. John lets us know, that he that believeth not a record, or te&s;timony, which if believed, would give him a witne&s;s, make him &s;ure of eter|nal life, maketh God a liar. Now, if faith does not create its own object, or lay its own foundation, what can be plainer, than that God hath made &s;alvation as &s;ure to &s;inners, <HI>in the object and decree,</HI> before they believe, as afterwards? But I cannot &s;peak plainer than one divinely in&s;pired. See 1. John, v. 10,&mdash;13. "He that believeth on the Son of God, hath the witne&s;s in him&s;elf: he that believeth not God, hath made him a liar; becau&s;e he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son. AND THIS IS THE RECORD, THAT GOD HATH GIVEN TO US ETERNAL LIFE: AND THIS LIFE IS IN HIS SON. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God, hath not life. The&s;e things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God." The apo&s;tle here a&s;&s;ures us, that we cannot have the &s;en&s;e, comfort and enjoyment of life, until we have the Son of God, in our &s;ouls, the object of our faith, and fountain of our life.</P>
<P>BUT, it is clear that neither our faith
<PB N="57" REF="030609_0056_0FE82C4FD3C3C0E0">
or hope, can have any influence on the pre|vious object of our faith, or foundation of our hope; both the&s;e are immutable and eternal. Let the &s;tate of our minds, at pre&s;ent, be whatever it may, "neverthele&s;s the foundation of God &s;tandeth &s;ure, having this &s;eal, the Lord knoweth them that are his." And when we come to know the truth, then will follow, as a fruit and con|&s;equence, all holine&s;s and virtue. "And let every one that nameth the name of Chri&s;t, depart from iniquity."</P>
<P>THE apo&s;tles, in all their preaching, com|manded every one of their hearers to be|lieve &s;aving truth, on pain of damnation, knowing, at the &s;ame time, that their belief, or unbelief, would not in the lea&s;t alter that truth. Yet their comfort in the truth, de|pended on their acquaintance with it, and belief of it; and without belief they mu&s;t be damned. But Chri&s;t has engaged for their knowledge and belief of the truth, in his own time, as &s;urely as he hath laid the foundation for it, or become the object of it. For his three great offices apply to every poor &s;inner alike. To whom&s;oever he is a prie&s;t, to him al&s;o he will be a prophet and a king. Illumination, regeneration, &s;ancti|fication and per&s;everance to eternal life, <HI>are as ab&s;olutely from God as the atone|ment was.</HI> "All things are of God." "Of him, and through him, and to him, are all things, to whom be glory forever, Amen." The Redeemer of &s;inners, <HI>&s;o fallen as we are,</HI>
<PB N="58" REF="030609_0057_0FE82C5636B109A0">
&s;aith it not in vain, "I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, the fir&s;t and the la&s;t. "Let him that is athir&s;t come: And who&s;oever will, let him take the water of life freely." He hath engaged to give the appetite, as well as its object: "Him hath God exalted, with his right hand, to be a Prince and a Savior, for to <HI>give repentance</HI> to <HI>I&s;rael</HI> and <HI>forgivene&s;s</HI> of &s;ins, i. e. to all given to Chri&s;t in covenant, all families of the earth in Abraham. Repen|tance and pardon, faith and ju&s;tification, holine&s;s and heavenly glory, are all alike the gift of the Son of God, and alike within his divine commi&s;&s;ion and engagement.</P>
<P>HERE the reader may wi&s;h to &s;ee the ex|tent of the covenant, or engagement be|tween the Father and the Son; whether it extends to all mankind, or only to a part. This &s;hall be mo&s;t carefully, and impartially attended to, in a proper place; as I would, at pre&s;ent, continue my chain of thought, on the apo&s;tolic manner of preaching, as well as the matter of it.</P>
<P>THE whole which the apo&s;tles preached, as go&s;pel, was the atonement of Chri&s;t, and its whole import; with all things con|nected with it, and all the fruits and con&s;e|quences of it. Indeed they kept the law every where in view, in all their preaching. The de&s;ign of this was, that the hearts of men might be well di&s;po&s;ed to receive and obey the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>THE pure go&s;pel which they preached, was ju&s;t what I have now mentioned;
<PB N="59" REF="030609_0058_0FE82C57C4ACC318">
"nothing but Je&s;us Chri&s;t and him crucifi|ed," i. e. the character and offices of Chri&s;t, with his obedience unto death, and the whole import of it. They held up Chri&s;t as a compleat Savior, in whom God &s;hews mercy to &s;inners. They excluded every thing in man, from having any, <HI>the remote&s;t</HI> &s;hare in the matter of his ju&s;tification, or reconciliation to God: Every thing, I &s;ay, good as well as bad; grace after the im|plantation of it, as well as enmity before. They con&s;idered ju&s;tification and acceptance with God, not as any real change in the &s;inner, but a change <HI>wholly relative.</HI> "To him that worketh not, but believeth on him that ju&s;tifieth the <HI>ungodly,</HI> his faith is <HI>counted</HI> for righteou&s;ne&s;s."</P>
<P>FAITH is, in the nature of things, nece&s;&s;a|ry to an experience and enjoyment of the benefit, as well as by expre&s;s divine appoint|ment. But faith does not create the bene|fit; or change the divine purpo&s;e; or make any alteration in the previous certainty of any thing in the univer&s;e: As my hearing any piece of news from afar, well atte&s;ted, and believing it, makes no alteration as to the fact, which is the object of my belief.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE, my kin&s;man in Judea died ten years ago, and left me all his large e&s;tate, by will, well authenticated. I never heard of his death or good will to me, until two years ago, and then I did not believe it. The evidence I then had did not command my a&s;&s;ent. Ten days ago, the intelligence came with &s;uch demon&s;tration and weight
<PB N="60" REF="030609_0059_0FE82C5C5C608E90">
of evidence, that I could not help believing it, and was much affected with the wonder|ful love and rich kindne&s;s of my good kin&s;|man. For I knew I had always been a mo&s;t injurious, ungrateful wretch to him; and had always di&s;honored him as much as was in my power; and would have killed him, many a time, had I been able. I was cer|tain that he knew all this. Which, by the way, was the grand rea&s;on why I could not before believe the good news, on former re|ports; and continued to wander about &s;tarving, in rags, beggary and &s;hame. But the evidence, at la&s;t, was attended with &s;uch light of truth, and the power of demon&s;tra|tion, that it commanded my entire belief.</P>
<P>I NOW enjoy the comfort of a rich inherit|ance, and my whole &s;oul is much moved with the kindne&s;s of my abu&s;ed kin&s;man. I think of him and all his goodne&s;s, and of my&s;elf, and all my horrid wickedne&s;s, very different|ly from what I did in the days of my vile enmity and malice again&s;t my be&s;t friend; and it affects all my conduct. Yet the in|heritance was as &s;urely mine two, or ten years ago, or even at the moment of my kin&s;man's death, as it is now, or ever will be.</P>
<P>BEFORE I believed this news, I was <HI>con|demned,</HI> or <HI>damned</HI> to beggary and infamy, and &s;hould have been &s;o all my days, had I not heard and believed it; but now I am rich, and abound in all things, through my <HI>ble&s;&s;ed, good</HI> benefactor, and in full oppo&s;ition to all my de&s;erts. I have no heart, <HI>now,</HI> to
<PB N="61" REF="030609_0060_0FE82C5FD3BB6440">
feel towards him, or &s;peak of him as I once did. So "the grace of God that bringeth &s;alvation, hath appeared to <HI>all men;</HI> teaching us that denying ungodline&s;s and worldly lu&s;ts, we &s;hould live &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly and godly, in this pre&s;ent world; <HI>looking for that ble&s;&s;ed hope,</HI> and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Savior Je&s;us Chri&s;t: Who gave him&s;elf for us, that he might re|deem us from all iniquity, and purify unto him&s;elf a peculiar people, zealous of good works." Titus ii.</P>
<P>THE apo&s;tles every where preached, <HI>as pure go&s;pel,</HI> God wholly reconciled, <HI>but &s;inners not.</HI> Rom. v. 2. Cor. v. Colo&s;&s;. i. Heb. ii. 17. In preaching the <HI>pure go&s;pel,</HI> they always af|firmed, that God hath nothing, <HI>nothing at</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> again&s;t any &s;inner, in the world, to effort his <HI>final condemnation;</HI> that all he ever had again&s;t them, was fully &s;atisfied by their &s;urety; that he had borne all their &s;ins, in his own body on the tree; that "he was brui&s;ed for their iniquities, and wounded for their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions; that the cha&s;ti&s;e|ment of their peace was upon him, and that by his &s;tripes they are healed;" "that Me&s;|&s;iah was cut off; but not for him&s;elf." Many a glorious hour they &s;ounded the go&s;pel in this very &s;train; but then, as a proper introduction of it as a me&s;&s;age of grace to the hearts of men, they always &s;ea|&s;oned it with the fiery and dreadful law. Yet this was no part of the go&s;pel; but quite the counterpart.</P>
<P>THUS, the preaching of all the prophets,
<PB N="62" REF="030609_0061_0FE82C6558750068">
that of Chri&s;t and all the apo&s;tles, was mixed preaching. The law and go&s;pel were carried along together, though di&s;tinct, and even oppo&s;ite in their natures. Thus all &s;kilful preachers do, in the&s;e days, and will to the end of the world. The pro|priety of it is very great, for the rea&s;on I have mentioned. Yea, I &s;ay further, that the &s;ame thing will be kept in view in hea|ven to all eternity; the law and the go&s;pel, both in full life and vigor, on the minds of all the redeemed of mankind. This will be nece&s;&s;ary to keep up their emotions of gra|titude, and their warme&s;t &s;en&s;e of the infi|nite obligations they are under to their God and their Redeemer. They will often name their Redeemer in their anthems and halle|lujahs; but cannot call him by that name, without calling to mind what they once were, and what they were redeemed from. Their &s;ong will be in this divine &s;train, "Thou art worthy; for thou wa&s;t &s;lain, and ha&s;t redeemed us to God by thy blood." Rev. v. 9.</P>
<P>SAINTS in heaven, to all eternity, will feel them&s;elves <HI>in them&s;elves,</HI> as worthy of dam|nation, as the devils in hell. They will know that they them&s;elves have made no amends to ju&s;tice, <HI>becau&s;e infinite power and grace hath made them holy.</HI> They will &s;ee, and feel, that <HI>&s;eparate from their head,</HI> the lowe&s;t hell is their ju&s;t due: They will <HI>&s;ee</HI> and <HI>feel</HI> this, <HI>deep in their &s;ouls</HI> forever more; and <HI>in this &s;en&s;e</HI> "the &s;moke of their tor|ment will a&s;cend up forever and ever." And

this view of the damned, <HI>in the gla&s;s of ju&s;tice,</HI> will give them the keene&s;t reli&s;h of grace, <HI>free grace, mere mercy, &s;overeign mercy,</HI> and forever animate the body of Chri&s;t, with raptures of love unutterable.</P>
<P>THE apo&s;tles, in what they preached <HI>as go&s;pel, good news, glad tidings,</HI> to all people; never made any the lea&s;t di&s;tinction between the certain &s;alvation of one &s;inner and ano|ther. They, every where, <HI>mixed in the law;</HI> and <HI>this</HI> again made no di&s;tinction: For every word of it damned the preacher, and all his hearers. It condemned every thing &s;hort of ab&s;olute perfection. With one ju&s;t and aw|ful voice, it always damned all <HI>human nature;</HI> and even the human nature of the Son of God, in a way of &s;ureti&s;hip, or imputation. "He who knew no &s;in was made &s;in for us, that we might be made the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God in him."</P>
<P>BUT, the apo&s;tles always made a great and clear di&s;tinction, between one &s;inner and another, as to pre&s;ent privileges and enjoy|ment, and al&s;o with regard to the degree of future ble&s;&s;edne&s;s. The penitent, believing &s;inner, they declared ju&s;tified, pardoned, entitled to eternal life, and a ble&s;&s;ed degree of comfort, <HI>even now.</HI> The impenitent &s;in|ner, and the unbeliever, they pronounced <HI>unpardoned,</HI> unju&s;tified, condemned already; and affirmed that the wrath of God did abide on him.</P>
<P>THEY every where a&s;&s;erted, that early pie|ty, and eminent holine&s;s in this life, would have a great advantage over a long life of
<PB N="64" REF="030609_0063_0FE82C6CCB642340">
&s;in, or later piety, or le&s;s holine&s;s and u&s;e|fulne&s;s: Not only in regard to peace and tranquility, comfort and delight of &s;oul, in this world; but even with re&s;pect to the weight of glory in the world to come. Yet, they always, <HI>as go&s;pel,</HI> affirmed the final &s;al|vation of all mankind alike. Paul, and his brethren were indeed very earne&s;t on this head; and ready to labor this point effectu|ally; and to &s;uffer any reproach they might meet with, on the account of this glorious doctrine. 1. Tim. iv. 10. "For therefore we both labor and &s;uffer reproach, becau&s;e we tru&s;t in the living God, who is the <HI>Savior of all men, &s;pecially</HI> of tho&s;e that believe; the&s;e things command and teach;" i. e. build on this principle, with &s;uch degree of explanation as the divine &s;pirit may direct, at the pre&s;ent period of time: It being the will of God that light &s;hall yet increa&s;e. The difference beforementioned, is very <HI>&s;pecial,</HI> very great indeed, between tho&s;e who now believe, and repent, and obey the go&s;pel, and delight their &s;ouls in all the con|&s;olations of it: And tho&s;e who are now in unbelief under the damnable power of im|penitence, and every hateful lu&s;t. Chri&s;t is the Savior of the <HI>former e&s;pecially,,</HI> but, <HI>if Paul is not mi&s;taken,</HI> he is the SAVIOR OF ALL MEN, at la&s;t.</P>
<P>THE inter&s;per&s;ion of the law with the go&s;|pel, is exceedingly manife&s;t, through the whole word of God. This con&s;ideration is nece&s;&s;ary, to vindicate the holy &s;criptures again&s;t the charge of contradiction. There
<PB N="65" REF="030609_0064_0FE82C7042D59218">
is no other po&s;&s;ible way to do this; nei|ther is their need of any other way. It is &s;o common every where, that it is &s;carcely expedient to &s;ingle out any pa&s;&s;ages in par|ticular. I will refer, however, to one or two, as a general &s;pecimen. I&s;ai. xliii. 21, &amp;c. "This people have I formed for my&s;elf; they &s;hall &s;hew forth my prai&s;e. But thou ha&s;t not called upon me, O Jacob; but thou ha&s;t been weary of me, O I&s;rael. Thou ha&s;t not brought me the &s;mall cattle of thy burnt|offerings, neither ha&s;t thou honored me with thy &s;acrifices. I have not cau&s;ed thee to &s;erve with an offering, nor wearied thee with increa&s;e. Thou ha&s;t brought me no &s;weet cane with money, neither ha&s;t thou filled me with the fat of thy &s;acrifices; but thou ha&s;t made me to &s;erve with thy &s;ins, thou ha&s;t wearied me with thine iniquities. I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions FOR MINE OWN SAKE, and will not remem|ber thy &s;ins. Put me in remembrance: let us plead together: declare thou that thou maye&s;t be ju&s;tified." See al&s;o, I&s;ai. lvii. 13. to the end. I&s;ai. lxiii. throughout.</P>
<P>INDEED, all the prophets abundantly u&s;e this method of keeping law and go&s;pel in view; and would be guilty of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t contradictions in the world, upon any other &s;uppo&s;ition. The apo&s;tles do the like. The &s;ame well connected &s;cheme runs on to the final judgment, with an a&s;pect to endle&s;s eternity. For, when judgment is clo&s;ed, and the my&s;tery of God, in this world fin|i&s;hed,
<PB N="66" REF="030609_0065_0FE82C76CD9A5C60">
this &s;ame thought extends into eter|nity, and, as I &s;aid before, &s;hall forever be kept in full view. "The&s;e &s;hall go away into everla&s;ting puni&s;hment; but the right|eous into life eternal." Matt. xxv. i. e. The voice of law and ju&s;tice is <HI>everla&s;ting puni&s;h|ment</HI> to &s;inful men, con&s;idered in their <HI>per|&s;onal character;</HI> but in the <HI>righteous character</HI> of their atoning Spon&s;or, the go&s;pel pro|claims life eternal. Two different char|acters are the very things here in view. And this is not at all uncommon in laws and rules, divine and human. The charac|ter is often named, and the per&s;on omitted, though &s;ome per&s;on always &s;tands connected with the character, and is under&s;tood in that connection.</P>
<P>MANKIND, in the pa&s;&s;age ju&s;t quoted, are con&s;idered in <HI>two characters:</HI> In their own <HI>per&s;onally;</HI> and then the voice of the right|eous law is, "the&s;e &s;hall go away into ever|la&s;ting puni&s;hment:" And, in <HI>Chri&s;t, the righteous,</HI> by union of faith, (and all &s;hall certainly have this before the judgment day, as will appear in its proper place,) and, in this character, the go&s;pel &s;peaks, and the law al&s;o, as &s;atisfied in the atonement: "But the righteous into life eternal." The <HI>per&s;on</HI> is de&s;ignated by the <HI>character,</HI> which is fre|quent in the common language of mankind, as when we &s;ay, <HI>the ruler, the judge, the &s;ub|ject, the king, the creditor, the debtor,</HI> &amp;c. &s;ome per&s;on is always under&s;tood, to whom the character applies.</P>
<P>I KNOW that a character cannot &s;uffer
<PB N="67" REF="030609_0066_0FE82C7856B89AC8">
pain, or enjoy happine&s;s, &s;eparate from the per&s;on; and an objector may here &s;ay, "this de&s;troys the force of the argument." But I think it does not at all: For the per&s;on de&s;ignated by the character, can enjoy, or &s;uffer. All mankind will &s;u&s;tain both of the&s;e <HI>characters,</HI> at the day of judgment; <HI>that</HI> of the wicked <HI>in them&s;elves per&s;onally;</HI> and <HI>that of the righteous,</HI> in the Son of God, by union and imputation.</P>
<P>THE objector may &s;ay, "this doctrine as much proves that all &s;hall go to hell, as that all &s;hall go to heaven; or, that all &s;hall go away into everla&s;ting puni&s;hment, and al&s;o into life eternal, which is impo&s;&s;ible; for the per&s;on can go but one way." It is true, the per&s;on can go but one way, and the per&s;on only can &s;uffer, or enjoy; but the wicked <HI>character</HI> is capable of remaining an everla&s;ting object of wrath, &s;hame, contempt, and damnation, or condemnation, and will &s;o, in the view of God, and all holy in|telligencies. The righteous character will remain an eternal object of approbation, worthy of life eternal.</P>
<P>BUT which way &s;hall the per&s;ons of man|kind go? They are de&s;ignated both ways, and oppo&s;ite ways, by their oppo&s;ite char|acters, and they can go but one, and they are all, you &s;ay, to go together; by the voice of the law and ju&s;tice to hell; by the voice of redeeming love in Chri&s;t, to heaven. Which way &s;hall they all go? Which &s;hall get the victory? The &s;entence of per&s;onal ju&s;tice; or the declaration of grace through
<PB N="68" REF="030609_0067_0FE82C7CEBAE2100">
the atonement? Which voice, or &s;entence &s;hall triumph? Which &s;hall reign? It is a weighty, all important que&s;tion; the man of in&s;piration &s;hall decide it. "But where &s;in abounded grace did much more abound: that as &s;in hath reigned unto death, even &s;o might GRACE REIGN THROUGH RIGHTEOUS|NESS TO ETERNAL LIFE. BY JESUS CHRIST OUR LORD." Rom. v. 20, 21.</P>
<P>WHOEVER will, with a mind entirely un|bia&s;&s;ed, read the whole chapter with due attention, will &s;ee this grand point fairly &s;tated, fully di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, and as fairly decided, as the power of language can expre&s;s. There the fir&s;t and &s;econd Adam, each a foederal head to <HI>all men,</HI> are &s;et in full con|tra&s;t: Ju&s;tice and grace, the law and go&s;pel, death and life, condemnation and ju&s;tifica|tion, obedience and di&s;obedience. The <HI>ap|proved term</HI> has all along a "<HI>much more</HI>" affixed to it; and every where triumphs over its <HI>oppo&s;ite.</HI> Chri&s;t and the go&s;pel, grace and life, ju&s;tification and obedience, every where abound, reign, and triumph, over all the rebellion and guilt of the fir&s;t Adam, and that of all his race, even, in the deepe&s;t colors, mo&s;t awful malignity, and <HI>wide&s;t extent</HI> of it.</P>
<P>AND the general tenor of divine revela|tion, bears this uniform a&s;pect; exhibiting and a&s;certaining the univer&s;al victory of the &s;eed of the woman, over that of the &s;erpent. "As I live &s;aith the Lord, every knee &s;hall bow to me, and every tongue &s;hall confe&s;s to God." "Look unto me and be ye &s;aved, <HI>all
<PB N="69" REF="030609_0068_0FE82C80632C8440">
the ends of the earth</HI>; for I am God and there is none el&s;e. I have &s;worn by my&s;elf, the word is gone out of my mouth in right|eou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;hall not return; that unto me every knee &s;hall bow, every tongue &s;hall &s;wear. Surely &s;hall one &s;ay, in the Lord have I righteou&s;ne&s;s and &s;trength; even to him &s;hall men come, and all that are in|cen&s;ed again&s;t him &s;hall be a&s;hamed." I&s;ai. xlv. 22, &amp;c. "Being found in fa&s;hion as a man, he humbled him&s;elf, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cro&s;s. Wherefore, God al&s;o hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name; that, at the name of Je&s;us, <HI>every knee</HI> &s;hould bow; of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things un|der the earth; and that <HI>every tongue</HI> &s;hould confe&s;s, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is Lord, to the glory of God the Father." Phil. ii. 8, &amp;c.</P>
<P>WHENEVER the apo&s;tles preached to a mixed multitude, as they often did, they commanded them by divine authority to believe, every one the &s;elf &s;ame truth. And it was the duty of every one to believe the &s;ame, and a great &s;in for any one not to believe. The warrant of faith was the &s;ame to all; the <HI>object,</HI> the <HI>foundation</HI> the &s;ame, as pre&s;ented to all. They, who believed, re&s;ted on &s;ure &s;alvation; yet their faith made no|thing true that was not true before, as to the foundation on which their whole de|pendance re&s;ted. Had they not believed, at that time, "neverthele&s;s the foundation of God would have &s;tood equally &s;ure, and
<PB N="70" REF="030609_0069_0FE82C84FA312FB0">
with the &s;ame &s;eal." "And what if &s;ome did not believe? &s;hall their unbelief make the faith (<HI>faithfulne&s;s</HI>) of God without effect? God forbid: yea let God be true and every man a liar." Rom. iii. 3, &amp;c.</P>
<P>NOW reader, turn to the bible and read that chapter to the end. You will &s;ee the &s;alvation of all the human kind alike &s;ecured, in the firm decree, and &s;overeign love of God, and in the atonement, power, and faithfulne&s;s of his Son; and all di&s;tinctions among men removed out of the way, as fully as words can po&s;&s;ibly expre&s;s. The preaching is mixed, as u&s;ual; the law, in all its infinite purity and amazing terror, condemning all mankind <HI>alike</HI>; and the go&s;|pel, in all its triumphant glory with the &s;ame a&s;pect of <HI>&s;ure &s;alvation</HI> to every child of Adam. This idea being every where attended to by the in&s;pired writers, viz. that faith alone gives every poor, apo&s;tate &s;inner, &s;en&s;e, enjoyment, and final a&s;&s;urance of &s;alvation, in his own &s;oul. The law is e&s;tabli&s;hed, and the go&s;pel triumphant in the final redemption of human nature.</P>
<P>IT is manife&s;t enough, that all could not take the benefit, in ca&s;e they did believe, unle&s;s there was a previous, &s;ure foundation, alike for every one. No one lays the foun|dation by his faith; but all build upon it. "Other foundation can no man lay, than that which is laid, which is Je&s;us Chri&s;t." Faith, agreeably to every ju&s;t idea we can form of it, never had, never can have, any other province than this; to give us &s;en&s;e
<PB N="71" REF="030609_0070_0FE82C8769427C18">
and enjoyment of an unalterable fact or object, if comfortable; or di&s;tre&s;s, if the rever&s;e. Oppo&s;ite objects are equally the objects of our belief. Two men are de&s;tined to certain death, by an enraged band of fu|rious a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, in clo&s;e pur&s;uit. The <HI>one</HI> can &s;ee and hear well, and knows he mu&s;t die immediately, and is in awful terror; the <HI>other</HI> is totally blind and deaf. Is not the death of the latter as &s;urely impending as that of his fellow? The <HI>one</HI> hath <HI>&s;en&s;e,</HI> the <HI>other</HI> not; but the dreadful decree is alike &s;ure to both.</P>
<P>I PROCEED now to con&s;ider the decrees of God, or doctrine of election, according to rea&s;on and divine revelation. It mani|fe&s;tly &s;tandeth thus.</P>
<P>THERE was a period in eternal duration, which God inhabits, or filleth up, (as in &s;cripture phra&s;e he is &s;aid to inhabit eter|nity) in which there was no exi&s;tence but God only, and when deity had in full view all po&s;&s;ible exi&s;tence. Out of which infinite comprehen&s;ion, or view of all things, he might create what he plea&s;ed. He &s;aw what was be&s;t to be brought into actual exi&s;tence, and what not; or what would form the wi&s;e&s;t, be&s;t, mo&s;t perfect, and mo&s;t benev|olent &s;y&s;tem of creation. This his wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s moved him to determine to bring into actual exi&s;tence, in the fitte&s;t time and manner. On this choice, his know|ledge of all actual, future exi&s;tence was founded, according to our be&s;t manner of
<PB N="72" REF="030609_0071_0FE82B8C55C2A208">
conception. He determined what &s;hould be, when he might as well have determined otherwi&s;e, if he had &s;een it be&s;t; and, in that ca&s;e, would have otherwi&s;e decreed. Then the &s;y&s;tem would have been different from what it now is, or ever will be; al&s;o, he would have foreknown it as a different &s;y&s;tem. But, &s;eeing as he did, with infinite wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s, what would be be&s;t, he eternally determined what &s;hould, in due time, take place in the &s;cale of exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>ON this, according to all the rational conceptions of man, was founded his certain foreknowledge of all real, future being, or exi&s;tence, in the univer&s;al &s;y&s;tem; I &s;ay his foreknowledge of <HI>every thing,</HI> without the lea&s;t exception, from the greate&s;t world and highe&s;t creature that ever he did, or will create, to the very lea&s;t and lowe&s;t; from the highe&s;t angel to the minute&s;t reptile or in|&s;ect; and from the greate&s;t world to the lea&s;t particle or atom of du&s;t; including every thing of a moral nature, every thought, volition or inclination of all moral agents, that &s;hould ever come into being; all their different mea&s;ures, capacities, powers, tal|ents, motives and di&s;po&s;itions; and the uni|ver&s;al connection and re&s;ult of the whole, as well as every &s;ingle and particular ope|ration. In a word, he eternally foreknew all actual, future exi&s;tence, moral and natu|ral, without a po&s;&s;ibility of mi&s;take.</P>
<P>THIS knowledge was founded in his own infinitely wi&s;e choice, and unalterable deter|mination or decree: Or, if you plea&s;e, his
<PB N="73" REF="030609_0072_0FE82C8EECF32420">
infinitely wi&s;e and good election. And every thing moral and natural, every being and mode of being, every circum&s;tance, every connection and con&s;equence through|out the whole &s;cale or &s;y&s;tem of being, did originally, ab&s;olutely depend on the choice, election, decree, or prede&s;tination of the eternal, immutable Jehovah. And all things, in actual being, have now the &s;ame entire, ab&s;olute dependance, and ever will have to all eternity.</P>
<P>I CAN conceive of no God at all, but in the above view. If I recede in the lea&s;t from this idea, I fall into complete athei&s;m. Divine revelation is plain upon this &s;ubject. "Of him, and through him, and to him, are all things." "He is of one mind and who can change him? and what his &s;oul de&s;ireth that he doth." "Of whom took he coun&s;el?" "He doeth according to his will, in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth; and none can &s;tay his hand, or &s;ay unto him, what doe&s;t thou?" I might recite a thou&s;and &s;entences full to the &s;ame purpo&s;e; but it is needle&s;s. Read the whole book of Job, and you will &s;ee every argu|ment there founded on the doctrine of the divine determinations, and the infu&s;trable accompli&s;hment of them all; and the infinite fitne&s;s it &s;hould be &s;o. Indeed there can be nothing more con&s;picuous every where, through the whole bible. And in the rea|&s;onings of man, there can be no &s;tep be|tween this idea of God, and athei&s;m.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="030609_0073_0FE82B8DDD64FA88">I HAVE &s;aid, that God's prede&s;tination, foreknowledge, election, choice, decrees, (or whatever name by which you indicate the &s;ame thought) are alike concerned with all exi&s;tence, and all modes of exi&s;tence, both natural and moral, to all extent of &s;pace, and to all endle&s;s duration. This is indeed true, and thus far gives us a becoming view of God. But I am now to apply this grand truth to the concerns of our &s;alvation alone, according to the plain word of God. <HI>Therein</HI> the doctrine of God's fixed election, or choice; his determinate coun&s;el and fore|knowledge; his &s;ure, unfailing prede&s;tina|tion; his purpo&s;es in him&s;elf before creation began, are expre&s;&s;ed as plainly as any thing can be expre&s;&s;ed, and exactly agreeable to all our rational ideas of a Supreme Being.</P>
<P>IN divine revelation, we find the election, decree, prede&s;tination, or appointment of God, with re&s;pect to &s;everal objects; but in every ca&s;e alike fixed and certain. It may &s;uffice to con&s;ider the doctrine only in four re&s;pects; from whence we may ea&s;ily make application to every other ca&s;e. In regard, <HI>Fir&s;t;</HI> To particular men. <HI>Secondly;</HI> To &s;ome particular events. <HI>Thirdly;</HI> To par|ticular communities of men. <HI>Fourthly</HI>; To the eternal &s;alvation of men.</P>
<P>IN <HI>God's revealed will,</HI> his election, or pre|de&s;tination hath &s;ometimes &s;pecial regard to &s;ome particular men, in di&s;tinction from others; and is always &s;overeign, and be|coming God, who never can fore&s;ee any di&s;tinctions among creatures, but what, from
<PB N="75" REF="030609_0074_0FE82C90744FA5B8">
all eternity, he was determined him&s;elf to make.</P>
<P>THUS, he elected Abraham to be a fa|vorite of his, the father of his covenant people, rather than Nahor. Thus, for wi&s;e and holy ends, he cho&s;e that Pharaoh &s;hould be an example of great ob&s;tinacy, rather than Mo&s;es. Rom. ix. Thus he elected Jacob to many ble&s;&s;ings rather than E&s;au; David, rather than Shimei, or Saul; Cyrus, rather than Nebuchadnezzar; Paul to know and enjoy the con&s;olations of the go&s;pel, in early life, and, for a happy &s;ea&s;on in this world, rather than Pilate. It is needle&s;s to mul|tiply particular in&s;tances. In a word; it is founded on God's election, choice, or pre|de&s;tination, that any man in the world, is, <HI>in this life,</HI> in circum&s;tances more eligible than his neighbor, or any other man. All the&s;e things are wholly of God, and of his eternal purpo&s;e, however they may be ef|fected by the in&s;trumentality, or different conduct of moral agents: For even all their different conduct, and every different incli|nation in the univer&s;e, has an equal and ab&s;olute dependance on the eternal, fixed purpo&s;e and plan that was unalterable, in the mind of Jehovah, before creation began. This may &s;erve as a &s;pecimen of what is in|tended by election, or the choice of God, as to all di&s;tinctions among men in this world.</P>
<P>WITH regard to God's eternal election, or choice relative to all events that take place in time, prede&s;tination is of the &s;ame gen|eral con&s;ideration.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="030609_0075_0FE82C950CF4F4A0">THUS, it was prede&s;tinated that the deli|verance of I&s;rael, and the overthrow of their enemies, &s;hould be at the time, and in the manner it was at the red &s;ea, rather than at a different time, and in another manner: That the deliverance of God's people from their captivity in Babylon, &s;hould be in all circum&s;tances as it was, when it might have been effected with a thou&s;and different cir|cum&s;tances, had Jehovah &s;een fit, and &s;o determined. There was the choice and election of God in all this. I&s;ai. xlv. and xlvi. So with regard to the crucifixion of Chri&s;t, the time, manner, and whole in&s;tru|mentality, was eternally fixed, in the divine purpo&s;e. Acts ii. 23.

It is ju&s;t &s;o with all events, from the greate&s;t to the lea&s;t, and all di&s;tinctions among them.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame rea&s;oning applies with regard to all communities of mankind in the world, and all their di&s;tinctions.

<P>THUS the Jews were elected to enjoy the &s;pecial privileges of divine revelation, for a long &s;ea&s;on, in di&s;tinction from all their fellow-men be&s;ide. Al&s;o, a few among them were elected to know and enjoy inward &s;aving con&s;olation, in this world, in di&s;tinc|tion
<PB N="77" REF="030609_0076_0FE82C97ADF48AA8">
from the great majority of that nation. So the Greeks and Romans, in ancient times, were elected to enjoy the many ble&s;&s;ings of civilization, learning, and exten&s;ive empire, in di&s;tinction from the ignorant and bar|barous nations of the world. Thus al&s;o, many particular per&s;ons of tho&s;e learned and polite nations, were prede&s;tinated to &s;pecial acquirements and ble&s;&s;ings of know|ledge and u&s;efulne&s;s, in di&s;tinction from the body of tho&s;e nations. Innumerable in|&s;tances of the like kind, in a greater or le&s;s degree, have been found among men, and bodies or communities of men, wherein the eternal prede&s;tination of God, has, in due time, appeared.</P>
<P>NOT only all particular per&s;ons that are wi&s;e and virtuous, holy and good, in this life; but al&s;o all churches or holy commu|nities, that, <HI>as &s;uch,</HI> &s;u&s;tain the character now mentioned, enjoy al&s;o, all the privileges and comforts connected with &s;uch a character, <HI>in this life,</HI> in con&s;equence of the eternal elec|tion, or free, &s;overeign choice of God. And they are, in this proper and very important &s;en&s;e, <HI>the elect;</HI> in contradi&s;tinction from tho&s;e that yet live in blindne&s;s, and are tor|mented by the cruel power of un&s;anctified nature, and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed in the awful &s;lavery of &s;in. They likewi&s;e, <HI>as holy, virtuous and u&s;eful communities,</HI> are elected to a &s;uperior and di&s;tingui&s;hed reward of grace in the world to come.</P>
<P>IN this view, they &s;tand di&s;tingui&s;hed from tho&s;e that yet live in ignorance of God

and &s;alvation, and without u&s;efulne&s;s in the world; tho&s;e that are yet haters of God, and oppo&s;ed to the highe&s;t good of his creatures. From all &s;uch, I &s;ay, tho&s;e who now know God, love and &s;erve him, and &s;erve their generation by his will, are greatly di&s;tin|gui&s;hed, by the election of God. This is abundantly taken notice of in the word of God; for a &s;pecimen, read Ephe&s;. i.</P>
<P>WHENEVER election, or prede&s;tination, in &s;acred &s;cripture, <HI>doth di&s;tingui&s;h one per&s;on,</HI> or <HI>one community,</HI> or <HI>de&s;cription of per&s;ons, from another,</HI> it never hath the lea&s;t regard to any thing <HI>beyond the grave;</HI> excepting a difference in degree of felicity.</P>
<P>IN the la&s;t place, the doctrine of prede&s;ti|nation hath, in the &s;acred oracles, great and frequent re&s;pect to our everla&s;ting &s;al|vation after death.</P>
<P>IT is a mi&s;taken apprehen&s;ion, in &s;ome, that <HI>election, decree, prede&s;tination,</HI> &amp;c. nece&s;|&s;arily implies di&s;tinction between &s;ome and others of mankind. The words do not <HI>ne|ce&s;&s;arily,</HI> or even <HI>naturally,</HI> imply any &s;uch thing. It may, or may not be included in the idea, or &s;ignified by any of tho&s;e terms, with equal propriety. This di&s;tinction is &s;ignified, as I have &s;hewn, as to advantages and di&s;advantages in this world, and degrees of happine&s;s in the world to come. But, the words, decree, prede&s;tination, election, and the like, might be u&s;ed with equal propriety, were there never any di&s;tinction at all to be made between one man and another, either in this world or that to come. All words
<PB N="79" REF="030609_0078_0FE82C9F0647CDA8">
of this import, only &s;ignify a firm and fixed purpo&s;e; an immutable determination of God; an e&s;tabli&s;hment irrever&s;ible; an un|alterable plan of conduct, laying out what &s;hall take place and what not.</P>
<P>IF God had <HI>cho&s;en, decreed,</HI> or <HI>prede&s;tinated</HI> that never any evil &s;hould exi&s;t, either moral or natural; the whole plan would have &s;tood upon God's election, prede&s;tination, or decree, as much as it does now. It is therefore wholly a mi&s;take, to &s;uppo&s;e the words carry in them naturally any idea of di&s;tinction. If all the other planets in the &s;olar &s;y&s;tem, are full of rational inhabitants, as is very probable, and if they are all holy and happy, which may be the ca&s;e; yet their condition is founded on the eternal choice, decree, and prede&s;tination of the Creator as much as ours. The eter|nal plan, whatever it be, whether more &s;im|ple or mixed, is alike built on God's elec|tion, decree or prede&s;tination. On any &s;up|po&s;ition, it is ju&s;t what God determined it &s;hould be, in every relation and circum|&s;tance.</P>
<P>TO know what the decrees of God are, or what his election, choice, or prede&s;tination is, in regard to mankind after this life, we mu&s;t con&s;ult what he hath told us, and abide only by what he hath revealed to us in his word. I have before &s;aid, that there is not one thought of di&s;tinction between one man and another, intimated to us in the whole bible, with regard to their <HI>certain &s;alvation,</HI> in the life to come; though, as to the <HI>differ|ent
<PB N="80" REF="030609_0079_0FE82CA08F181708">
degree</HI> of happine&s;s, the di&s;tinction is manife&s;t.</P>
<P>THE divine will, pupro&s;e, election, decree, prede&s;tination, or by whatever term you would &s;ignify the eternal, immutable plan of Jehovah, does, every where in his word, <HI>fully &s;ecure the certain happine&s;s of</HI> ALL <HI>the hu|man race,</HI> after death. This a&s;&s;ertion is bold, the reader may &s;ay; I therefore now appeal to God's own word for the truth of it.</P>
<P>THE words, <HI>decree, prede&s;tination, purpo&s;e, and election</HI> (which, the learned will bear me witne&s;s, are terms promi&s;cuou&s;ly u&s;ed in tran&s;lating the &s;ame original <HI>hebrew and greek</HI>) with their derivatives, are brought to our view one hundred and twenty four times, in the old and new te&s;tament. They mo&s;tly refer to things of a temporal kind; and in this &s;en&s;e, a di&s;tinction between one man, or one body of men and another is generally clear enough. Some are elected to privi|leges and enjoyments, in this world, either civil or religious, and others omitted. This is frequent, as to temporal matters, or enjoy|ments during this life, or any period of time pointed out. Of this de&s;cription is the ca&s;e of E&s;au and Jacob; in which noth|ing at all is included but what is of a tem|poral nature with regard to them and their po&s;terity: Al&s;o, that of Abraham and his &s;eed; in which nothing after death is made peculiar to them, only, as Abraham and his &s;eed were typical of Chri&s;t and the church univer&s;al. In this view, all man|kind &s;hare alike in the election of that pa|triarch,
<PB N="81" REF="030609_0080_0FE82CA637486F70">
and that people, as will &s;oon ap|pear. So in the election of Cyrus, for great purpo&s;es in this world; and almo&s;t every where in the &s;acred oracles, the&s;e terms de|note only what was to begin and end in a certain period of time. And, it is always &s;o, when any di&s;tinction is made between one man, or one de&s;cription of men and another, excepting the decrees of future hap|pine&s;s.</P>
<P>WE now further attend to the divine purpo&s;e, or election, only as it re&s;pects the eternal &s;alvation of mankind, after this life. Here, every reader, that hath that rare at|tainment of reading and thinking wholly without previous bias of mind, will &s;ee there is no di&s;tinction at all, as to the <HI>cer|tain &s;alvation</HI> of the human kind. In this view, God has <HI>one elect head</HI> and no more; and <HI>one elect body</HI> and no more. The <HI>elect head</HI> is BEN-ADAM, the <HI>Son of man,</HI> in equal connection with all human nature. The <HI>elect body</HI> is all human nature.</P>
<P>THE forgetful reader may here cry out, where then is the di&s;tinction which election implies? But have I not &s;ufficiently &s;hewn, that the term implies no &s;uch thing nece&s;&s;a|rily, or even naturally. There may be a di&s;tinction, or there may not, con&s;i&s;tent with the natural meaning of this word, or any other word of like meaning, as prede&s;ti|nation, purpo&s;e, decree, determinate coun|&s;el, &amp;c. All the&s;e phra&s;es import a certain, fixed, unalterable plan of Deity; whether that
<PB N="82" REF="030609_0081_0FE82B95EC4C6888">
plan contains many di&s;tinctions, or none at all. The reader will pardon this &s;udden repetition, as the idea is of e&s;&s;ential impor|tance.</P>
<P>I NOW &s;ay again, that election, or pre|de&s;tination, as it re&s;pects mankind, after death, centres in one head, CHRIST <HI>the Son of God, the Son of man, the only mediator</HI> between God and man; and <HI>all human kind, as his kindred body.</HI> This head is in a like <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>foederal</HI> connection with the whole body of human nature. Hence we find the Me&s;&s;i|ah never calling him&s;elf the <HI>Son of Abraham,</HI> or the <HI>Son of David,</HI> (though others might &s;ometimes call him &s;o) but <HI>Ben-Adam the Son of man.</HI> We find &s;ome of the prophets frequently &s;o called of God, as types of Chri&s;t. The mediator, in his per&s;on and in his types, is pointed out by this epithet, about one hundred and fifty times, in the prophets and in the new te&s;tament; and almo&s;t every time he &s;peaks of him&s;elf, he u&s;es this term. I do not recollect that he ever called him&s;elf the Son of Abraham, or of Noah, or the Son of David, or of any man that ever was, except the fir&s;t Adam.</P>
<P>THE reader will remember, as I have in|timated, (and the learned all know it well) that the Son of man is in the hebrew, lite|rally <HI>the Son of Adam,</HI> and the meaning the &s;ame in the original greek. This is the phra&s;e our Savior generally u&s;eth, when &s;peaking of him&s;elf; and manife&s;tly for no other rea&s;on, than to keep in our view his relation to, and connection with <HI>human na|ture,
<PB N="83" REF="030609_0082_0FE82CA8D090BCE8">
in the univer&s;al extent of it,</HI> without any di&s;tinction, or any more connection with one man, or one de&s;cription of men, than with another.</P>
<P>IT is true, he is pointed out &s;ometimes by the prophets, as the &s;eed of Abraham; the branch of Je&s;&s;e; the &s;on of David, &amp;c. But the&s;e de&s;criptions of him are only to direct the church or people of God, and all that waited for the Me&s;&s;iah, how to know when the true Me&s;&s;iah did indeed come. And the tribe of Judah, and town of Bethle|hem are mentioned for the &s;ame end, with many other de&s;criptions, that we may know the true Me&s;&s;iah, and be guarded again&s;t all impo&s;tors. But Chri&s;t, in his human na|ture, never had any more intimate connection with Abraham, Judah, or David, in contra|di&s;tinction from human nature in general, than he had with Judea, or Bethlehem, in contradi&s;tinction from any other coun|try, or town in the world. We know he had none with tho&s;e places, that made him a peculiar Savior to them, in di&s;tinction from other parts of the world; though he was born in that country, and in that town.</P>
<P>INDEED, human nature is identically one now, ju&s;t as much as it was, when all were in Adam. Eve was of him, and all human na|ture is &s;o. The &s;hooting out of many branches, does not, in the lea&s;t, alter the nature of the tree. We have had no intermarriages with any other &s;pecies to divide or alienate the blood. All human fle&s;h is called "<HI>thy own fle&s;h.</HI>" All human blood is one blood.
<PB N="84" REF="030609_0083_0FE82CAF2A5E5BF8">
"God hath made of <HI>one blood</HI> all nations to dwell upon the face of the earth." Hence, with me, there is no doubt, that the <HI>&s;econd man, the Lord from heaven</HI> hath cho&s;en this epithet, when &s;peaking of him&s;elf &s;o many times, both typically and per&s;onally, to im|pre&s;s on our minds a &s;en&s;e of his common, equal union and connection with all human nature, as our <HI>Goel,</HI> or kin&s;man Redeemer.</P>
<P>NOW, I &s;ay this Son of man is God's only object, as an elect head in regard to our eternal &s;alvation; and all human nature is his <HI>one entire elect object,</HI> in union with Chri&s;t, as a body with a head. The Savior expre&s;sly &s;ays "he came to &s;eek and to &s;ave, not &s;ome of tho&s;e that were lo&s;t; but" <HI>that which was lo&s;t, that humanity; that nature; that complex body;</HI> which he &s;o often by the &s;pirit of in&s;piration calls <HI>the world; the whole world; all men; all nations; all people.</HI> "Glad tidings of great joy &s;hall be unto <HI>all people.</HI>" But I may &s;peak more of the elect body, af|ter I have further attended to the elect head. The &s;econd man, or the Son of man is often called <HI>God's elect,</HI> or <HI>cho&s;en,</HI> by way of em|pha&s;is; and the fountain of life to all men; and a &s;ub&s;titute, or &s;urety in the place of a whole fallen world; or covenant head of all human nature.</P>
<P>NO believer, I think, ever will doubt but that the Son of man, the Savior of the world is &s;poken of, under the type of David. P&s;al. lxxxix. 1,&mdash;37. There we find him God's elect, or cho&s;en, connected with all the world, by way of command and &s;ubjugation.
<PB N="85" REF="030609_0084_0FE82CB0B29B3EF8">
This all allow, <HI>in Chri&s;t,</HI> denotes &s;piritual conque&s;t and victory. There we find God has entered into covenant with him, as one he has cho&s;en out of the people. The Father &s;peaks to him as Son of man; and &s;peaks to him &s;ome things peculiar to the divine nature, and many things to him as media|tor and redeemer. Particularly, that the heavens &s;hall prai&s;e his wonders; that none in heaven or among the &s;ons of the mighty can be compared with him; that the heavens are his, the earth al&s;o and the fulne&s;s of it; that the people are ble&s;&s;ed, who become ac|quainted with him, or know the joyful &s;ound of his grace and love. God gives him full dominion to the utmo&s;t extent of the earth; to every &s;ea and every river; and makes every mountain to rejoice in his &s;trength, i. e. the power of his &s;alvation; attributes to him a redeeming power, equal and exten&s;ive as his creative power. Here is God's elect head of mankind, God's cho&s;en, and here is de&s;cribed the extent of his dominion in the world. In the &s;econd p&s;alm, he is &s;et up with like elective appointment, and exten|&s;ive dominion; with power to break and da&s;h effectually, until all bow to him, from the loftie&s;t king, to the mo&s;t ob&s;cure pea&s;ant in the uttermo&s;t parts of the earth.</P>
<P>IN the lxxii. p&s;alm it is declared that his &s;aving power &s;hall be extended over the whole earth. All nations, the greater with the le&s;s, it is &s;aid, &s;hall partake of his peace and righteou&s;ne&s;s, and bring forth the fruit of the &s;ame. "The mountains &s;hall bring
<PB N="86" REF="030609_0085_0FE82CB73971CF80">
peace to the people and the little hills by righteou&s;ne&s;s." "They &s;hall fear him, as long as the &s;un and moon endure, through|out all generations." "He &s;hall have do|minion from &s;ea to &s;ea, and from the river to the ends of the earth;" including the mo&s;t barbarous and ob&s;cure inhabitants of the world. "They that dwell in the wilderne&s;s &s;hall bow before him; all &s;hall be &s;ubdued to him," "his enemies &s;hall lick the du&s;t." All rulers and potentates; all di&s;tant princes &s;hall bring him tributes of prai&s;e and obe|dience. "His name &s;hall endure forever, be continued as long as the &s;un, and men &s;hall be ble&s;&s;ed in him; <HI>all nations</HI> &s;hall call him ble&s;&s;ed." It is declared that from a very &s;mall beginning, like the confined di&s;cove|ries of redeeming love, then among the Jews, its ble&s;&s;ings &s;hould be, in due time, extended as the gra&s;s of the earth, and the fruit be copious and a&s;toni&s;hing. In metaphor thus expre&s;&s;ed, "there &s;hall be an handful of corn in the earth, upon the top of the mountains; the fruit thereof &s;hall &s;hake like Lebanon, and they of the city (i. e. the city or people of God, extended all over the world) &s;hall flouri&s;h as the gra&s;s of the earth." Read the whole P&s;alm and view the elect head and elect body.</P>
<P>I KNOW, that in all declarations of God's eternal decree, the idea of di&s;tinction and limitation among the elect body, is kept up: Some &s;hall &s;ooner become acquainted with the&s;e things, and &s;ome later: Some in a higher, and &s;ome in a lower degree: Some
<PB N="87" REF="030609_0086_0FE82CB8C5BB73F8">
more happily affected than others, and bring forth more fruits of holine&s;s, and en|joy more con&s;olation in con&s;equence there|of. But all the&s;e di&s;tinctions and limita|tions are confined to the pre&s;ent world a none reach beyond.</P>
<P>THE Son of man &s;aith, "all that the Father hath given me &s;hall come unto me, &amp;c." The que&s;tion is, how many? The an&s;wer is "He &s;hall give thee the heathen for thine inheri|tance, and the uttermo&s;t parts of the earth for thy po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion." i. e. To be in due time &s;ubdued and conquered, by the king anoint|ed on the holy hill of Zion; and made to &s;erve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling, and to ki&s;s the Son. Here al&s;o, the idea of the holy and dreadful wrath of God is di&s;played, and the voice of ju&s;tice announcing terrible de&s;truction.</P>
<P>I WISH the reader cautiou&s;ly to keep in mind what I have ob&s;erved before, that the whole of divine revelation is every where mixed from beginning to end, law and go&s;pel &s;ide by &s;ide; the voice of ju&s;tice and that of grace; and that the latter, by the &s;ure de|cree of heaven, and by the merit and power of the Son of God, is to get the final victory. "Grace &s;hall reign through righteou&s;ne&s;s unto eternal life, by Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord."</P>
<P>THIS elect head is fully equal to his great work of &s;aving all men, taking away the &s;ins of the world. As he died, not only for our &s;ins, who are now di&s;tingui&s;hed from others by an early &s;en&s;e of his grace, and early manife&s;tations of his fulne&s;s; but al|&s;o
<PB N="88" REF="030609_0087_0FE82CBD5BB838D0">
for the &s;ins of the whole world. He can and will extend, in due time, his all effi|cacious offices, and exertions of prophet and king, co-exten&s;ive with his work as a prie&s;t. He will &s;eek and &s;ave that <HI>lo&s;t thing.</HI> The utmo&s;t perver&s;ene&s;s of human nature will be overcome, until "the earth &s;hall be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the &s;ea." This elect head of human nature "&s;hall &s;tand for an en&s;ign of the people, to it &s;hall the Gentiles &s;eek, and his re&s;t &s;hall be glorious;" read I&s;ai. xi.</P>
<P>AGAIN, the elect of God in whom his &s;oul delighteth, &s;hall manife&s;t to all nations the judgment of the law, or ju&s;tice of God, wholly &s;atisfied in him. All, that his obe|dience unto death hath merited, his power and faithfulne&s;s will apply to the human kind, in the mo&s;t di&s;tant times and regions. In &s;pite of all oppo&s;ition he will not fail nor be di&s;couraged, until the mo&s;t di&s;tant i&s;lands in the world have bowed to the all command|ing power of his grace, the almighty energy of his &s;pirit; &s;o that they &s;hall &s;ing to the Lord a new &s;ong, and his prai&s;e from the end of the earth. The wilderne&s;s and the cities thereof &s;hall lift up their voice; the inhabitants of the rock &s;hall &s;ing, and they &s;hall &s;hout from the top of the mountains. Read I&s;ai. xlii. from the beginning to the 16th ver&s;e.</P>
<P>THIS glorious head and the elect body are <HI>one,</HI> in the prede&s;tination of God. "I will bring forth a &s;eed out of Jacob, (i. e. Chri&s;t) and out of Judah an inheritor of my moun|tains,
<PB N="89" REF="030609_0088_0FE82CC0D1B72BE8">
and mine elect (that is; the body of Chri&s;t) &s;hall inherit it, and my &s;ervants &s;hall dwell there." I&s;ai. lxv. 9. "For thus &s;aith the Lord I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the gentiles like a flowing &s;tream," it is again &s;aid in the pro|phet "as the days of a tree are the days of my people, and mine elect &s;hall long enjoy the work of their hands." "The Lord &s;hall be king over all the earth; in that day &s;hall there be one Lord and his name one:" i. e. All people &s;hall be united in his character. We might compile a volume of citations from the prophets, all of the &s;ame tenor, as <HI>pure go&s;pel;</HI> and, at the &s;ame time &s;ee many limitations and di&s;tinctions among mankind, of a <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> different character, and the voice of ju&s;tice every where intermixed, and crying aloud for vengeance; but the voice of grace and the blood of Chri&s;t &s;peaking better things. "Lo the lion of the tribe of Judah, the root and offspring of David hath prevailed."</P>
<P>I COULD wi&s;h that every reader might attend to Paul's di&s;cour&s;e on the doctrine of election, e&s;pecially in the ninth, tenth and eleventh chapters of his epi&s;tle to the Romans. There we find an eternal, fixed plan of Deity, in&s;uring the final &s;alvation of all the <HI>literal,</HI> or <HI>natural</HI> &s;eed of Abraham; all the Jews. Yet, in the cour&s;e of this life, in the cour&s;e of time, and God's di&s;pen&s;a|tions <HI>on earth,</HI> with that nation, the apo&s;tle takes notice of as great and &s;overeign di&s;|tinctions,
<PB N="90" REF="030609_0089_0FE82B9C48F66B18">
as between Jacob and E&s;au, in temporal matters; and makes the latter an emblem to illu&s;trate the former.</P>
<P>HE bewails, from his own former bitter experience, hardne&s;s of heart, and enmity again&s;t Chri&s;t; the mi&s;erable ca&s;e of that nation as a body. They wi&s;hed them&s;elves at the greate&s;t di&s;tance from Chri&s;t and all his offered grace, as he once did, or could do, in his blindne&s;s and enmity. He could &s;ympathize with them, and greatly pity them, from his own experience. He &s;aw but a very few of them reconciled to their Me&s;&s;iah, or in the knowledge and enjoyment of the benefit; only a remnant po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the knowledge, &s;en&s;e, and comfort of &s;alvation.</P>
<P>MANY more gentiles had come to the knowledge and comfort of eternal &s;alvation than of the Jews; though they were very zealous, and followed after righteou&s;ne&s;s in their own blind way. They rejected an all-&s;ufficient atonement, and eternal life, on the &s;ame footing that any publican might have it, or any poor, &s;candalous, filthy <HI>dog</HI> of the gentile world. For they gave other na|tions no better epithet. They did not at all under&s;tand how, <HI>in Chri&s;t</HI> (the only cha|racter that God hath the lea&s;t re&s;pect unto, in the final &s;alvation of all men, or <HI>any</HI> man) every valley was filled, and every moun|tain and hill made low, and all crooked things &s;traight, and all rough things plain, and the Lord alone exalted: How all boa&s;t|ing was cut off, and God would &s;tain the pride of all glory. The&s;e things they did
<PB N="91" REF="030609_0090_0FE82CC6533BB8A8">
not under&s;tand; therefore they &s;ought &s;al|vation by ways of di&s;tinction, or as it is ex|pre&s;&s;ed by the works of the law." They &s;uppo&s;ed that they mu&s;t, &s;ome how, be marked different from other men; before, any thing God had ever done, would be a <HI>&s;ure foundation</HI> and a <HI>&s;ole foundation</HI> of their hope.</P>
<P>THE apo&s;tle tells them that this was a mo&s;t mi&s;erable &s;tate of mind to be in, and a mo&s;t comfortle&s;s condition; that they were aw|fully blind, as to all pre&s;ent knowledge, love, and &s;ervice of God, or con&s;olation; and that the pre&s;ent temper of their hearts involved in it wickedne&s;s, <HI>inju&s;tice,</HI> demand|ing eternal damnation, in their own per&s;ons. He labors with the utmo&s;t concern, to bring them to know better, to enjoy the comfort of hope, and to love and &s;erve God in con&s;e|quence of it. Yet he fully a&s;&s;erts that God had <HI>&s;ecured,</HI> and, in his own time, would cer|tainly <HI>effect</HI> the final &s;alvation of every Jew that ever had exi&s;tence. He declares that although their blindne&s;s was &s;o awful at pre|&s;ent; yet it &s;hould not finally prevent their &s;alvation.</P>
<P>AFTER all he &s;ays again&s;t their mo&s;t abominable ob&s;tinacy, and the doleful effects of it, <HI>in this world;</HI> he a&s;&s;erts that the final &s;alvation of his whole kindred nation, &s;tood on a foundation very different from any thing <HI>in them,</HI> or in <HI>any creature.</HI> "And &s;o all I&s;rael &s;hall be &s;aved: As it is written, there &s;hall come out of Zion a deliverer, and &s;hall turn away ungodline&s;s from Jacob:
<PB N="92" REF="030609_0091_0FE82B9DD03F3DA0">
For this is my covenant unto them, when I &s;hall take away their &s;ins. As concerning the go&s;pel, they are enemies for your &s;akes;" i. e. they are left in awful blindne&s;s, <HI>for the pre&s;ent,</HI> and will be for a &s;ea&s;on, that the go&s;pel may have a greater &s;pread among you Gentiles, "but, as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers' &s;akes." i. e. Their &s;alvation is &s;ecured in the elect body of Chri&s;t, together <HI>with,</HI> and as fully <HI>as that</HI> of their fathers, the patriarchs and prophets, who walked ever &s;o humbly and uprightly before God, and enjoyed great con&s;olation: "For the gifts and calling of God are with|out repentance." Rom. xi. 25.</P>
<P>GOD never re&s;ted one atom of his eternal plan and fixed purpo&s;e, on any creature, or any thing that &s;hould ever, at any particu|lar time, be found in creatures. They all rather &s;ub&s;erve the accompli&s;hment of it. Indeed, they can by no means fru&s;trate "the determinate coun&s;el and foreknowledge of God," in any one in&s;tance.</P>
<P>GOD cuts off all mankind, <HI>wholly, in every view,</HI> but in his <HI>own Son,</HI> Jews and Gentiles alike, and there is not the lea&s;t difference. He concludes, or &s;huts all mankind up to|gether, in total wickedne&s;s and unbelief; and even in that very predicament, a&s;cer|tains their &s;alvation, and that of all alike. "For God hath concluded them all in un|belief, that he might have mercy upon all." Rom. xi. 32. This is mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing; but, I wi&s;h men would not cavil about it, and quarrel with it as they do. Let them
<PB N="93" REF="030609_0092_0FE82CC907108090">
rather feel in their hearts, towards the great God and his &s;overeign will, wi&s;dom, and grace, as Paul did; and &s;ay, with him; "O the depth of the riches, both of the wi&s;|dom and knowledge of God! how un&s;earch|able are his judgments (i. e. decrees) and his ways pa&s;t finding out! For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: To whom be glory forever, Amen. I wi&s;h the reader carefully to attend to the Epi&s;|tles to the Romans and Galatians, in par|ticular, although all the writings of Paul, and the whole &s;acred &s;cripture centre in the &s;ame great point; <HI>Chri&s;t, and the &s;alva|tion of his my&s;tic body.</HI></P>
<P>IN a word; the doctrine of God's elec|tion, or eternal, fixed choice, decrees, pre|de&s;tination, by what name &s;oever you are plea&s;ed to call it, as it re&s;pects his grace to the human kind in this world, and their &s;alvation in the world to come, &s;tands ex|actly thus, in all the rea&s;on we are capable of, and in all the &s;acred oracles. All is fixed and immutable, in the mind of Jehov|ah, from eternity to eternity; involving in|numerable di&s;tinctions among men, com|munities, and nations of men; and, as ma|ny in regard to privileges, light, comfort, influence and effect, <HI>in the pre&s;ent world;</HI> and great, and innumerable di&s;tinctions and differences in the life and <HI>world to come,</HI> in regard to <HI>different degrees</HI> of happine&s;s, dig|nity, and glory. Yet the divine purpo&s;e alike &s;ecures all men <HI>in Chri&s;t alone;</HI> in his union with, and covenant for human nature,
<PB N="94" REF="030609_0093_0FE82BA3B2D3DB28">
<HI>as a covenant for the people,</HI> and Gods &s;alva|tion to the ends of the earth; and by the exertion of his office of prie&s;t, prophet, and king, in equal extent with each other. In this way, I &s;ay, alike &s;ecures every part of human nature, from any pain or &s;orrow in the world to come: And alike &s;ecures real happine&s;s and glory to every one, in that proportion of grace, which infinite wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s hath appointed.</P>
<P>WE now look into the atonement, the &s;ource of all hope to guilty man. Some have, in late years, imbibed a &s;entiment concerning the atonement, exceedingly dif|ferent from that of the prophets and apo&s;tles, that of the primitive fathers in the chri&s;tian church, or that of our chri&s;tian fathers in later times, &s;uch as <HI>Luther, Calvin, Owen, Flavel, Watts, Hooker, Edwards,</HI> and indeed every man in Europe and America, that has pa&s;t under the denomination of a calvini&s;t, &s;ince the reformation.</P>
<P>THEIR idea is, that the atonement is nothing of a vicarious nature. They ad|mit nothing like a &s;ub&s;titute; nothing like a legal transfer of guilt and righteou&s;ne&s;s, by divine con&s;titution and appointment; nothing like a bond&s;man paying for an original debtor; nothing like a redeemer, under the Jewi&s;h law, &s;tepping into the place of his kin&s;man, and redeeming by price his forfeited inheritance; nothing like a good character pre&s;ented and accepted, <HI>in law,</HI> in the room and &s;tead of a bad one,
<PB N="95" REF="030609_0094_0FE82CCE89379E80">
&amp;c. &amp;c. But the&s;e have been uniformly, the &s;entiments of tho&s;e I before mentioned, &s;ince the chri&s;tian aera; and the uniform &s;en&s;e of the Jewi&s;h church, with re&s;pect to the great atonement pointed out by all the &s;acrifices, &s;ub&s;titutes, propitiations, and a|tonements of that oeconomy; and have ever been the invariable &s;entiments of all nations of the earth, &s;o far as they have made u&s;e of propitiations and atonements.</P>
<P>THOSE ideas, and indeed, the idea of any proper atonement, or legal transfer of guilt and righteou&s;ne&s;s, is now wholly di&s;carded by &s;ome. They have, to the great a&s;toni&s;h|ment of many, boldly a&s;&s;erted that all the oblations and &s;acrifices of the ancient church, had no direct meaning in them; but that they are a vague and indefinite kind of premonition, that a Me&s;&s;iah &s;hould, in due time, &s;uffer, not however, as an <HI>ob|lation, vicar,</HI> or <HI>&s;ub&s;titute,</HI> for any man. Hence according to them, he did not bear any man's &s;ins in his own body on the tree, in any direct and proper &s;en&s;e; was not wounded for our tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, or brui&s;ed for our iniquities; the cha&s;ti&s;ement of our peace, was not upon him, nor are we healed by his &s;tripes: Only as in a mere metaphor|ical, indirect, and improper &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>HAVING denied the transfer, and every thing of the nature of a direct and proper imputation, they explain the whole import of Chri&s;t's obedience unto death, in the fol|lowing manner. "That God being in his free &s;overeign goodne&s;s, determined to &s;ave
<PB N="96" REF="030609_0095_0FE82CD0F62E02A8">
&s;inners, of his own mere mercy, was yet equally determined to vindicate his law, and give the highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible te&s;timony of his everla&s;ting approbation of it, to all in|telligent creatures. Therefore, with the free con&s;ent of his own Son, brought him under this &s;ame law, in human nature, and then ex|acted the whole demand of it. Hereby &s;hew|ing, that God &s;o highly e&s;teemed the law, as to honor it, at the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible expence; and that he was willing to do nothing, but as he would be done by. But in the like predicament, he was willing his Son &s;hould &s;uffer ju&s;t as his law demands of man: And having given this greate&s;t demon|&s;tration of the infinite excellency of his law, he now pardons and &s;aves whom he plea&s;es, of his own &s;overeign grace and mere mercy." This they call the atone|ment; though in full oppo&s;ition to all pro|priety of language, as will fully appear.</P>
<P>THEY have no idea of &s;etting this atone|ment to the account of man; or laying the iniquities of men on Chri&s;t, by any legal transfer, or any vicarious covenant of redemption, or any thing like imputa|tions on either &s;ide. They only &s;ay, that the door is now wide open for God to &s;ave &s;inners, and fully maintain all the honors of ju&s;tice, and that God now acts, accord|ing to the free propen&s;ity of his own nature, in this great affair.</P>
<P>THIS doctrine, if true, would, at fir&s;t &s;ight &s;hew us that the eternal happine&s;s of all &s;inners is made &s;ure. For what will not
<PB N="97" REF="030609_0096_0FE82BA62F94FC08">
infinite love (GOD IS LOVE) joined with infinite power do, when there remains not the lea&s;t claim of ju&s;tice, or any other di|vine attribute in the way? We may &s;afely abide by what God hath &s;o often, and &s;o clearly told us; that nothing but the claim of ju&s;tice can &s;tand in the way of our hap|pine&s;s. All his moral attributes are on the &s;ide of our happine&s;s, this only excepted. All his natural attributes are ready to carry into effect all that his infinite grace, mercy, and love point out; &s;aving only that the honor of his law, the copy of his infinite holine&s;s and ju&s;tice, &s;tands in the way.</P>
<P>THAT the moral nature of God is infinite love, is mo&s;t certain: That this love pleads infinitely for &s;paring every &s;inner from eternal death, he hath often &s;aid, and con|firmed by &s;olemn oath, Ezek. xviii. and through the whole tenor of his word. Now what can any de&s;ire more, to in&s;ure their own &s;alvation, than the declaration and oath of God, that his whole di&s;po&s;ition is infi|nitely oppo&s;ed to the final de&s;truction of any man: being al&s;o a&s;&s;ured, that every at|tribute of his nature, may appear infinitely glorious and honorable, in the &s;alvation of all; and that infinite, uncontroulable wi&s;dom and power, are ever ready to ac|compli&s;h all the divine will?</P>
<P>I THEREFORE &s;ay again, that, if the afore|mentioned, new notion of the atonement were ju&s;t, the final &s;alvation of all man|kind would be as &s;ure, as infinite love and
<PB N="98" REF="030609_0097_0FE82CD7826426F0">
power can make it; and there would need no more to be &s;aid on the &s;ubject. But I would not avail my&s;elf, at all, of this prin|ciple: For it is entirely oppo&s;ite to all rea|&s;on, and the whole word of God.</P>
<P>THE TRUE DOCTRINE OF THE ATONE|MENT is in very deed this. A <HI>direct, true,</HI> and <HI>proper &s;etting all our guilt to the account of Chri&s;t, as our foederal head and &s;pon&s;or: And a like placing his obedience unto death, to our account.</HI> In the covenant of redemption and divine con&s;titution, God regards both parties, ju&s;t as though the Son of man had per&s;onally done all, man hath done; and man had done and &s;uffered all that the <HI>&s;econd</HI> man hath him&s;elf done and &s;uffered. Rom. viii. 3, 4. "For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the fle&s;h, God &s;ending his own Son in the likene&s;s of &s;inful fle&s;h, and for &s;in condemned &s;in in the fle&s;h: That the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the fle&s;h, but after the &s;pirit." In the atonement, JEHOVAH looked on his Son, in the gla&s;s of foederal &s;tipula|tion, in the very character of &s;inful man, and, <HI>for him a true and proper &s;ub&s;titute</HI>; and treated him in ju&s;tice as &s;uch; and took complete &s;atisfaction of him, for all &s;inful man de&s;erved. This being done, he looks on &s;inful man in the <HI>true</HI> and <HI>proper character</HI> of his &s;ub&s;titute or vicar, even the Son of man, and will be &s;ure to treat him accord|ingly. The a&s;&s;ertion is mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing, and far from what man or angels would
<PB N="99" REF="030609_0098_0FE7EC1839E68280">
ever have thought of, had it not been re|vealed by God him&s;elf. This, agreeably to the divine oracles, is a con&s;tant mark of the truth.</P>
<P>HERE &s;ome may cry out and &s;ay, guilt and righteou&s;ne&s;s is of a per&s;onal nature, and cannot be transferred. But I now pro|mi&s;e, that in its proper place, I will fully demon&s;trate, that although both the&s;e are per&s;onal, they may be transferred, fully ac|cording to rea&s;on and common &s;en&s;e, as well as agreeably to the divine con&s;titution. But fir&s;t, I mu&s;t adduce my evidences to &s;hew that the &s;cripture doctrine of atone|ment is exactly as I have &s;tated.</P>
<P>HERE are four engli&s;h terms, frequent in the bible, which promi&s;cuou&s;ly convey the &s;ame idea, viz. <HI>atonement, ran&s;om, propitiation,</HI> and <HI>redemption.</HI> The learned will bear me wit|ne&s;s, that the &s;ame original hebrew and greek words, with all their compounds and deriv|atives, are promi&s;cuou&s;ly tran&s;lated by the&s;e engli&s;h words, with the derivatives and com|pounds of the &s;ame. The &s;ub&s;tantives are u&s;ed <HI>&s;eventy two</HI> times in the old and new te&s;tament, in the original, and al&s;o in the tran&s;lation. They, every where, either di|rectly import, or fairly allude unto a true and proper transfer, or &s;etting the doings or &s;ufferings of one, to the true and proper ac|count of another; or dealing with one, not in his per&s;onal character, but in the per&s;on|al character of another, <HI>by him a&s;&s;umed.</HI></P>
<P>I MIGHT fill many folios, &s;hould I bring up to view di&s;tinctly, every pa&s;&s;age in &s;crip|ture
<PB N="100" REF="030609_0099_0FE82D015AA522F0">
that is to the purpo&s;e, and make only a brief comment of each. I &s;hall only ad|duce a few, and leave the reader to add ma|ny more, at his lei&s;ure, if he plea&s;e. The plain import of all the &s;acrifices and obla|tions, which God appointed by Mo&s;es, fir&s;t meet our view. Their whole meaning cen|ters in the antitype, which all, that pay any regard to revelation, allow to be Chri&s;t. There is no figure no metaphor in a <HI>type,</HI> any more than in the mo&s;t plain and &s;im|ple propo&s;ition. All types only &s;peak in the mo&s;t direct manner to the <HI>eye,</HI> what the mo&s;t &s;imple propo&s;ition does to the eye, if read, or to the ear if pronounced. Our mouths &s;peak words; types &s;peak things more directly, and admit no metaphor.</P>
<P>THE term is fir&s;t u&s;ed, to give us the true and proper idea of a propitiation, ran&s;om, &amp;c. in Exodus xxi. 30. "If there be laid on him a &s;um of money, then he &s;hall give for the RANSOM of his life what&s;oever is laid upon him." Here the money mentioned, comes directly and properly into the place of the man's life; one or the other mu&s;t be laid down. Again Exodus xxx. 12, 16. "And thou &s;halt take the atonement-money of the children of I&s;rael, and &s;halt appoint it for the &s;ervice of the tabernacle of the congregation; that it may be a memorial unto the children of I&s;rael before the LORD, to make an atonement for your &s;ouls." An atonement is called <HI>atonement-money,</HI> the whole idea of which is negotiable, or transferable. In the ca&s;e of the redemp|tion
<PB N="101" REF="030609_0100_0FE82DA0848549A0">
of an inheritance that has been a|lienated, the word is often u&s;ed to &s;ignify a proper price. Levit. xxv. 23, 24, 25. Paul, with the plaine&s;t allu&s;ion to this chapter, comments upon it, applying it to the redemption by Chri&s;t. Ephe&s;. i. 14. "Which is the earne&s;t of our inheritance, until the redemption of the purcha&s;ed po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, unto the prai&s;e of his glory." How directly is the victim put in the place of I&s;aac? See Gen. xxii. No language can po&s;&s;ibly &s;peak plainer than the type of the two goats, Levit. xvi. The high prie&s;t killed one goat <HI>for the people;</HI> &s;hewing that they all de&s;erved to die, and that the antitype &s;hould indeed die <HI>for them.</HI> Then, by a plain &s;ignal, with full confe&s;&s;ion of all their &s;ins, laid them on the head of the &s;cape goat, to be carried away into everla&s;ting oblivion, as to any puni&s;hment that &s;hould come on them in another world, for their &s;ins; though the very &s;ymbol, &s;o often repeated, would keep them in perpetual remembrance, for a proper effect on their own minds.</P>
<P>DAVID applies the direct and proper im|port of all the&s;e types, to redemption by Chri&s;t, and makes u&s;e of the &s;ame words, P&s;alm xlix. 7, 8. "None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ran&s;om for him: For the redemption of their &s;oul is precious, and it cea&s;eth for|ever." Solomon under&s;tands the &s;ame term to mean <HI>one thing directly for another,</HI> Prov. xiii. 8. "The ran&s;om of a man's life are his riches." Read Paul's comment on the
<PB N="102" REF="030609_0101_0FE82D2139E9E998">
import of all the&s;e terms, centering in Chri&s;t, Rom. iii. 21. to the end. The apo&s;tle here and every where, notices the abundance of grace connected with our ju&s;tification: and al&s;o &s;hews us that there is much more of grace and mercy connected with our ju&s;ti|fication, by a <HI>true</HI> and <HI>proper imputation,</HI> than could be in any other way, which I &s;hall fully confirm in its proper place.</P>
<P>IN the fifth chapter of the epi&s;tle to the Ro|mans, Paul con&s;iders the atonement in this view: That Je&s;us paid the whole price for us, or exhibited his own character to God in the room and &s;tead of ours, when we were in our wor&s;t &s;tate, without repentance, with|out faith, in all our enmity, and in every view mo&s;t unworthy: That he did ju&s;tify us, not as <HI>penitent;</HI> but as <HI>impenitent;</HI> not as <HI>believers,</HI> but as <HI>unbelievers;</HI> for penitence and faith are exerci&s;es of a new heart, and godline&s;s; not as <HI>godly,</HI> in the lea&s;t degree; but as wholly <HI>ungodly</HI>: And then brings the knowledge and comfort of this previous tran&s;action to our &s;ouls, by giving us a <HI>heart prepared</HI> to have light and full evidence operate properly upon; al&s;o, communica|ting to us full evidence of what he hath done, &s;o that we receive a <HI>previous atone|ment,</HI> and "know the things that are freely given us of God."</P>
<P>JOHN tells us, if <HI>any man,</HI> any of the human kind &s;in, we have an advocate with the Father, Je&s;us Chri&s;t the righteous: that they who <HI>at pre&s;ent</HI> are convinced of this, have <HI>pre&s;ent &s;pecial comfort</HI> in it; but that
<PB N="103" REF="030609_0102_0FE82D0FD95FA2D0">
the propitiation and the advocate would &s;urely extend to all, in <HI>due time.</HI> For he de|clares that this advocate for any man, "is the propitiation for our &s;ins, and not for ours only, but al&s;o for the &s;ins of the WHOLE WORLD." He al&s;o declares, that a man mu&s;t have a good and obedient heart given him, in order to take this comfort. "And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments." 1. John, ii. 1, 2, 3.</P>
<P>JESUS tells us, Matt. xx. 28. and Mark x. 45. what the end of his death was; "to give his life a ran&s;om for <HI>many.</HI>" He does not, in the&s;e places, tell us <HI>how many.</HI> The word <HI>many,</HI> may comprehend a <HI>part,</HI> or <HI>all</HI> of the human race. In John i. 29. the ex|tent of the ran&s;om is declared. "John &s;eeth Je&s;us coming unto him, and &s;aith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the SIN OF THE WORLD." Paul under&s;tands this ran&s;om for many, to &s;ignify ju&s;t as many as there &s;hall ever exi&s;t of the human kind, and &s;o calls it "<HI>a ran&s;om for all.</HI>" 1. Tim. ii. 6.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame apo&s;tle &s;peaketh of the ex|ceeding comfort re&s;ulting from prede&s;tina|tion and adoption, as fir&s;t communicated to pre&s;ent believers, and equally &s;ure in God's time, to extend to all the children of men. Ephe&s;. i. 4,&mdash;14. "According as he hath cho&s;en us in him, before the foundation of the world, that we &s;hould be holy, and with|out blame before him in love: Having pre|de&s;tinated us unto the adoption of children,

by Je&s;us Chri&s;t to him&s;elf, according to the good plea&s;ure of his will, to the prai&s;e of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved: In whom we have redemption through his blood, the for|givene&s;s of &s;ins, according to the riches of his grace; wherein he hath abounded to|ward us in all wi&s;dom and prudence, having made known unto us the my&s;tery of his will, according to his good plea&s;ure, which he hath purpo&s;ed in him&s;elf: That in the di&s;|pen&s;ation of the fulne&s;s of times, he might gather together in one ALL THINGS in Chri&s;t, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth, even in him: In whom al&s;o we have obtained an inheritance, being prede&s;tinated according to the purpo&s;e of him who work|eth all things after the coun&s;el of his own will: That we &s;hould be to the prai&s;e of his glory, who fir&s;t tru&s;ted in Chri&s;t. In whom ye al&s;o tru&s;ted after that ye heard the word of truth, THE GOSPEL OF YOUR SALVATION: in whom al&s;o, after that ye believed, ye were &s;ealed with that holy Spirit of promi&s;e."</P>
<P>THE whole book of divine revelation gives us the &s;ame idea of the propitiation, atone|ment, ran&s;om, redemption; by whatever term is imported our <HI>meritorious</HI> ju&s;tification, a&s;certaining our final &s;alvation. <HI>Meritorious,</HI> I &s;ay; for never was there a clearer di&s;tinc|tion in the word of God, than the three different &s;ignifications of the term <HI>ju&s;tifi|cation:</HI> 1&s;t, By the atonement <HI>meritoriou&s;ly:</HI> 2. By faith <HI>in&s;trumentally,</HI> for comfort and enjoyment: 3. By works, <HI>declaratively,</HI> or

<P>IN the&s;e la&s;t two chapters referred to, the infinite; &s;overeign, all conquering grace and power of God appear mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing. Here the apo&s;tle con&s;iders the whole preach|ing of the go&s;pel, and faith wrought in the &s;oul, as having no other concern with their glorious objects; but only by comfort in them, and per&s;onal improvement: Not at all altering God's purpo&s;e and grace, or Chri&s;t's merits, or his &s;ure determination to apply them to &s;inners; but only giving them an apprehen&s;ion and &s;en&s;ibility of all the&s;e things, and &s;o laying a foundation for meet fruits.</P>
<P>PAUL &s;peaks of the whole as completed by God, in Chri&s;t, and nothing more remain|ing to be done, but the communication of it to &s;inners by regeneration, repentance, faith, and every grace; which are all, wholly the gift of God. "Unto me who am le&s;s than the lea&s;t of all &s;aints, is this grace given, that I &s;hould preach among the Gentiles the un&s;earchable riches of Chri&s;t; and to make
<PB N="106" REF="030609_0105_0FE7EC2B50EA0078">
<HI>all men &s;ee,</HI> what is the fellow&s;hip of the my&s;tery, which from the beginning of the world, hath been hid in God, who created all things by Je&s;us Chri&s;t." "That Chri&s;t may dwell in your hearts, <HI>by faith;</HI> that ye being rooted and grounded <HI>in love,</HI> may be able to comprehend with all &s;aints what is the breadth and length, and depth, and height; and to <HI>know the love of</HI> Chri&s;t, which pa&s;&s;eth knowledge, (i. e. far beyond all that mankind have hitherto conceived, otherwi&s;e there would be a flat contradiction) that ye may be filled with all the fulne&s;s of God." Ephe&s;. iii. "For the grace of God that bringeth &s;alvation, hath appeared to <HI>all men,</HI> (i. e, pre&s;ents one and the &s;ame a&s;pect to all the human kind, and the influence when known is alike on the hearts, and in the lives of all) viz. teaching us that, deny|ing ungodline&s;s and worldly lu&s;ts, we &s;hould live &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly, and godly, in this pre&s;ent world; looking for that ble&s;&s;ed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God, and our Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t: Who gave him&s;elf for us, (with as fixed a purpo&s;e of effectual application, as ever he had of meritorious impetration) that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify to him&s;elf a peculiar people (&s;tanding in &s;uch a relation to him, as neither angels, nor any other creatures do) zealous of good works;" i. e. as grace appears, and &s;alvation is brought to the &s;oul by evidence of faith, a zeal for good works does follow. Al&s;o tho&s;e men who, have manife&s;tations of this grace
<PB N="107" REF="030609_0106_0FE82CE12B8E73A0">
and &s;alvation, are di&s;tingui&s;hed from tho&s;e who are not as yet acquainted with it, "<HI>a pe|culiar people zealous of good works.</HI>" Titus ii. 11. &amp;c.</P>
<P>IT has been often &s;aid, that guilt and righteou&s;ne&s;s being of a per&s;onal nature can|not be transferred; and that the word of God confirms this, in that it is &s;aid, "the &s;oul that &s;inneth it &s;hall die."</P>
<P>IT has been with wonder and a&s;toni&s;h|ment, that I have heard &s;ome very &s;en&s;ible men make this remark. Guilt and right|eou&s;ne&s;s are of a per&s;onal nature, we all al|low; but the con&s;equence does by no means follow, that they cannot be transferred by or|der of JEHOVAH. Nor can there lie one argu|ment again&s;t &s;uch a transfer, but what will lie with equal force again&s;t any transfer of pro|perty, ever made in this world. What gives my neighbor a right to transfer his goods to me for money, or &s;ome other valuable con&s;ider|ation? certainly nothing but this, viz. the goods were his property, and the money mine. God gives us the whole warrant and right of contract, transfer, and di&s;po&s;al, and it is the &s;ame in every ca&s;e. <HI>The di&s;po&s;|er mu&s;t be the proprietor,</HI> &s;o far as the di&s;po&s;al is made; this will make it warrantable in every ca&s;e in the univer&s;e, and nothing el&s;e can. "May I not do what I will with mine own?"</P>
<P>NOW a creature cannot be an ab&s;olute proprietor in any thing: This is peculiar to God. Yet creatures have delegated proper|ty, within God's limitations. They have
<PB N="108" REF="030609_0107_0FE82DA20EBE23B0">
no property in oppo&s;ition to the claim of the Creator; yet they have in oppo&s;ition to the claims of their fellow creatures. Thus, this paper is mine, and not my neighbor's: But I cannot &s;ay it is mine, and not my Maker's. This applies to all that ever can be called the property of any creature. All our property, all that we are owners of, is ours only, in oppo&s;ition to the claim of our fellow creatures. God is &s;till as much the owner and proprietor of all things, as if he had never given any property to any crea|ture, under any directions or limitations whatever.</P>
<P>I HAVE a right to di&s;po&s;e of my hor&s;e, my labor, my land, &amp;c. and my neighbor has no right to controul me. Yet herein, and in all my conduct, I am bound to obey the will, and attend to the orders of the great, and ab&s;olute Proprietor of all things. Un|der this limitation, &s;o far as any thing is my own, I may transfer or di&s;po&s;e of it as I plea&s;e; and &s;o may every creature of God, in like manner. Has not God him&s;elf the &s;ame right without limitation of a &s;uperior? mo&s;t certainly. It is only then to &s;hew that God has as real property in all things, mo|ral and natural, temporal and eternal, as I have in the pen I now hold in my hand; and this will prove he has an equal right of di&s;po&s;al, by transfer or any other way. I can ea&s;ily demon&s;trate this and much more.</P>
<P>THERE are &s;everal ways, in which man|kind acquire property, in the limited &s;en&s;e afore&s;aid, or &s;uch property as we are capa|ble
<PB N="109" REF="030609_0108_0FE82DA8746C7C88">
of; particularly by di&s;covery and occu|pancy, by purcha&s;e, labor, free gift, &amp;c. In the&s;e ways we have a right of di&s;po&s;al and transfer, under the direction of the great and ab&s;olute Owner of all things.</P>
<P>BUT we &s;ee in a moment, that no proper|ty or right we claim, in any of tho&s;e ways, is in any mea&s;ure equal to the right ari&s;ing from <HI>creation,</HI> or the right of one who gives <HI>whole, intire being</HI> to what he claims. God has this right in every thing without po&s;&s;i|bility of exception; in every exi&s;tence na|tural and moral; in all creatures, and in all done by creatures; and in every di&s;po&s;i|tion found in creatures, evil as well as good. All guilt and all righteou&s;ne&s;s are the ab&s;o|lute property of the great God. He is the origin and fountain of all holine&s;s, goodne&s;s, righteou&s;ne&s;s; "there is none good but one, that is God." As all creatures are his ab&s;olute property, &s;o are all their di&s;po&s;i|tions and actions. Whether good or evil, it alters not the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>IN this view of God, as being the ab&s;olute proprietor, and having the &s;ole right of ab&s;o|lute di&s;po&s;al; the devil with all that per|tains to him, moral and natural, are as whol|ly and intirely God's property as Gabriel is. A man may be owner of bad property as well as good, and &s;o may God.</P>
<P>YOU have two &s;ons in their minority, the one the be&s;t, and the other the vile&s;t in the world. They are both alike yours, and at your di&s;po&s;al. One of your hands is wound|ed and in extreme pain, the other perfectly
<PB N="110" REF="030609_0109_0FE82DA9FB114EB0">
well; yet they are both alike your own. You have a flock of &s;heep in your pa&s;ture, and there is al&s;o a den of &s;erpents on your land, which you bought with all its appur|tenances. You are the owner and proprie|tor of tho&s;e venemous &s;erpents, as much as of your &s;heep, and have an equal right to kill them both; the one for the &s;upply of your table; the other for the &s;ake of being out of danger from their poi&s;on. You have an equal right to transfer them both. Some eminent phy&s;ician may appear, who knows well how he can turn that den of venemous &s;erpents to more advantage, and greater good to mankind, than he can all the &s;heep you po&s;&s;e&s;s. They are yours; and you may transfer them to him.</P>
<P>SO far as man is owner and proprietor of any thing, whether that thing be good or evil, it alters not the right of di&s;po&s;al in the lea&s;t. If I could exerci&s;e true benevolence to my fellow men, in healing them, and in furni&s;hing them with &s;ure antidotes again&s;t mortal poi&s;on, by keeping a den of the mo&s;t deadly &s;erpents, under proper re&s;traint; I would do it. No man would &s;ay I did wrong: Or that I was not the proprietor of them, and had no right to transfer them; becau&s;e they are &s;uch evil, hateful creatures. Thus, the MOST HIGH turns his whole cave of devils to good account, and to the greate&s;t perfection of benevolence, in a &s;y&s;tem re|plete with love. And &s;o he does all the moral evil in the univer&s;e. He makes u&s;e of creatures and things of the moral kind, which
<PB N="111" REF="030609_0110_0FE82DAE94684610">
are infinitely hateful to him, <HI>in their nature,</HI> to an&s;wer great and good ends, <HI>in the whole &s;y&s;tem.</HI></P>
<P>BUT God never made &s;in. Who did? The devil and wicked men. Be it &s;o. Yet this devil and all his a&s;&s;ociates, and all wick|ed men, are God's property, <HI>ab&s;olutely</HI> and <HI>wholly</HI> &s;o; and of con&s;equence all their do|ings are equally his property, Sin is a pro|perty infinitely hateful in its nature; but it is not therefore the le&s;s at God's di&s;po&s;al, as his <HI>own property,</HI> by transfer, or any other way he plea&s;es. God is an ab&s;olute &s;ove|reign in di&s;po&s;ing of it ju&s;t as he plea&s;es. "May I not do what I will with mine own?"</P>
<P>ON the other hand. As to all righteou&s;|ne&s;s; God is the original fountain of the whole, that ever did, or can exi&s;t in him&s;elf, and in all creatures. It is all ab&s;olutely his own property, as much after communication as before. And all the creatures to whom it is communicated, are in like manner his own. All the holine&s;s found in their tem|per, character and conduct is &s;o in every view; and Chri&s;t, as mediator and &s;avior of the world, is as ab&s;olutely his, as any crea|ture he ever made. "<HI>Chri&s;t is God's.</HI>"</P>
<P>NOW, in the name of rea&s;on and common &s;en&s;e, what hinders a transfer, if God plea|&s;es? does he meddle with any thing but his own ab&s;olute property; to which no other Being in the univer&s;e has any oppo&s;ite claim, any more that I have now a right to claim Godhead, as my own? Shew me, that JE|HOVAH is dealing in &s;omething that is not
<PB N="112" REF="030609_0111_0FE82D27ADB4C670">
his ab&s;olute property; and I will then, and not till then, deny that he hath a right to transfer guilt and righteou&s;ne&s;s, at his plea|&s;ure.</P>
<P>BUT if God is &s;uch a &s;overeign as this comes to, where is the &s;afety of creatures? where is the &s;afety of man? Be patient, kind reader, I will open to you a glorious foun|dation of &s;afety, in its proper place. Take only this hint for the pre&s;ent. All the &s;afety, hope, and happine&s;s of man, and of the whole, intelligent &s;y&s;tem, lies in the <HI>nature, moral character, eternal decrees,</HI> and <HI>&s;overeign will</HI> of JEHOVAH alone. But this is a di|gre&s;&s;ion, to be re&s;umed in its proper place.</P>
<P>IT is expedient here, that I &s;hew what it is that ever induced any man, that hath ac|knowledged divine revelation, to draw a con|&s;equence &s;o palpably erroneous, from a po|&s;ition that is very true. "<HI>Guilt and righte|ou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> &s;ay they, <HI>are of a per&s;onal nature:</HI> Certainly, <HI>therefore, God him&s;elf has no right to transfer them"!!!</HI> That is to &s;ay, God has no more property in the moral &s;y&s;tem than I have! JEHOVAH has no more right to give law to his creatures, than any one man has to another. The MOST HIGH has no right to covenant for his creatures, his own ab&s;olute property; though I have a good right to covenant for my children in many things, and effectually bind them to abide by what I have done.</P>
<P>IT is true, a man has ho right to covenant for his own children, in matters of a <HI>moral nature,</HI> matters of <HI>guilt</HI> and <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI>
<PB N="113" REF="030609_0112_0FE82D2935BDD7D0">
What is the rea&s;on that he may not do this, as well as in <HI>pecuniary</HI> matters? It is only becau&s;e God has given him his limits. Man is an ab&s;olute proprietor of nothing. He has a <HI>limited</HI> property, within certain bounds, and that under divine regulation; and thus far he may plead the general warrant of di&s;|po&s;al, "<HI>may I not do what I will with my own?</HI>" Beyond this he may not pre&s;ume. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of the highe&s;t angel; but not of God. He is wholly without limita|tion, with regard to his own ab&s;olute pro|perty, in all things <HI>moral,</HI> as well as all things <HI>natural.</HI> And in regard to <HI>righteou&s;|ne&s;s</HI> and <HI>guilt,</HI> they are in all rea&s;on, and by every dictate of revelation, as ab&s;olutely, and ju&s;tly at his di&s;po&s;al, as a &s;parrow, or a &s;ingle hair of your head.</P>
<P>IF any &s;hould here &s;ay, This makes God a guilty being, and his nature like the nature of &s;in. The cavil would be worthy of no other an&s;wer than this; If you own a very wicked &s;ervant, who&s;e temper and conduct is hateful to you every day; you are certainly as wicked as he.</P>
<P>WE now conclude, that God may accord|ing to rea&s;on and common &s;en&s;e, transfer and impute guilt and righteou&s;ne&s;s. His word declares abundantly that he hath this right, and that he hath exerci&s;ed it, to the mo&s;t be|nevolent and glorious purpo&s;e. This is the grand di&s;tingui&s;hing doctrine of divine reve|lation, which Paul con&s;idered as compre|hending the whole. <HI>This,</HI> with its glorious
<PB N="114" REF="030609_0113_0FE82D2DD2039280">
corrections and con&s;equences, claimed his whole attention. "For I determined not to know any thing among you, &s;ave Je&s;us Chri&s;t and him crucified." "God forbid that I &s;hould glory, &s;ave in the cro&s;s of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, by whom the world is crucified unto me and I unto the world." "God hath laid upon him the iniquity of us all." "He was wounded for our iniqui|ties, he was brui&s;ed for our tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, the cha&s;ti&s;ement of our peace was upon him, and by his &s;tripes we are healed." "Chri&s;t our pa&s;&s;over is &s;acrificed for us." "He who knew no &s;in was made &s;in for us, that we might be made the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God in him." "Thou &s;halt make his &s;oul an of|fering for &s;in."</P>
<P>REASON doth mo&s;t fully warrant or &s;up|port a &s;alvation by a proper <HI>vicar,</HI> by <HI>&s;ub&s;ti|tution,</HI> transfer, imputation of guilt and righteou&s;ne&s;s. Not a &s;ingle rea&s;on can be offered again&s;t it, but what will lie, even with greater apparent force, again&s;t your right of transferring one &s;hilling for a &s;upper; or redeeming your own brother out of pri&s;on, by the <HI>vicarious transfer</HI> of one pound. Rea&s;on, I &s;ay, tells us in the cleare&s;t, po&s;&s;ible manner, that God may &s;o redeem man, if he plea&s;es. But we are wholly in|debted to divine revelation, to know that he hath &s;o done. If he hath not there told us &s;o; it is utterly beyond all the power of language ever to communicate that idea. Give up this doctrine, and we may &s;till reckon the bible among good books, and
<PB N="115" REF="030609_0114_0FE82D320A98EFB8">
even call it the be&s;t on the whole. Yet there will be nothing left, to di&s;tingui&s;h it from the works of Plato, Cicero, Seneca, &amp;c. otherwi&s;e than as any one good writer may &s;omewhat excel another. If all man|kind would abu&s;e <HI>all words</HI> as they do <HI>&s;ome terms,</HI> who deny that the &s;alvation of &s;inners is founded on a <HI>proper &s;ub&s;titution;</HI> all u&s;e and benefit of language would be forever at an end.</P>
<P>THE rea&s;on why any run &s;o wild in this matter, is, becau&s;e they have not a true knowledge of JEHOVAH. They rea&s;on about "the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of heaven and earth," who is under no limitation, "and who worketh all things according to the coun&s;el of his own will;" ju&s;t as they would about the conduct of creatures, who have no ab&s;olute property, and are capable of none.</P>
<P>HERE, many have found fault with that mo&s;t clear doctrine of divine revelation, that God con&s;tituted Adam a foederal head for all his race; in language like this. <HI>"I was not pre&s;ent;" "I knew nothing about it;" "I did not agree to it;"</HI> therefore it is unju&s;t that I &s;hould be holden by it." Unthink|ing man! Do you not &s;o far as you have property, make bargains and covenants to bind your heirs and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, and tho&s;e unborn too? Will you not hold fa&s;t a privilege acquired in a covenant way, by your great grandfather, or any predece&s;&s;or at the di&s;tance of many generations, and de&s;cending to you by right of heir&s;hip? What if your neighbor &s;hould come and claim
<PB N="116" REF="030609_0115_0FE82D194BFFCED0">
your farm, and &s;ay, this was my grandfa|ther's; and he &s;old it; and I was not pre&s;ent. I never gave my con&s;ent; and I will not be holden by what he did. I will have the farm. Would you not tell him that his predece&s;&s;or did nothing but what he had a right to do; and bid defiance to his claim?</P>
<P>BUT God hath a better right to the di&s;po|&s;al of all things, <HI>moral</HI> and <HI>natural,</HI> than ever any man had to that of his land. Be&s;ides, he covenanted only for his <HI>own children,</HI> his <HI>own offspring.</HI> In this view, all mankind &s;tand in a much nearer relation to the com|mon Parent of all, than ever any child did to an earthly parent. And we can no more di&s;&s;olve this relation by all our &s;ins, than the wickedne&s;s of your &s;on, can make him cea&s;e to be <HI>your &s;on.</HI> Moreover, the cove|nant God made with Adam, was infinitely better than we could have made for our|&s;elves, had we been pre&s;ent; as will abund|antly appear in the &s;equel. However, God had full right to make it, and <HI>confirm it,</HI> and that on both &s;ides too, upon the ground of ab&s;olute and univer&s;al property.</P>
<P>WHEN you covenant with your neighbor it is proper for you to &s;ay, <HI>I will if you will:</HI> I propo&s;e, and wait for your con&s;ent. Other|wi&s;e there can be nothing binding. You make one part of the covenant, your neigh|bor the other: for you are equals. It is not &s;o with you, and that Being, "of whom, and through whom, and to whom, are all things." He every where makes both parts of the co|venant, and would de&s;cend infinitely be|neath
<PB N="117" REF="030609_0116_0FE82DB10BCD8F88">
his right and dignity if he did not. His language to man is, <HI>I will, and you &s;hall;</HI> and never leaves it at the election of man, to comply with his covenant, or refu&s;e with impunity.</P>
<P>BUT, &s;ome have imagined that this idea of ju&s;tification, by a <HI>true</HI> and <HI>proper atonement, &s;ub&s;titution,</HI> or <HI>ran&s;om,</HI> is incon&s;i&s;tent with free ju&s;tification by grace, or free &s;alvation by mere mercy, &s;o often &s;poken of in &s;crip|ture. This is &s;o far from being a ju&s;t re|mark, that I am bold to affirm, that free grace and mere mercy abound to &s;inners in this way, more than could be po&s;&s;ible in any other way. <HI>It is all grace,</HI> di&s;played and communicated to &s;inners, <HI>in the mo&s;t gracious way.</HI> Was it not infinite, &s;overeign grace and mercy in God that fir&s;t moved in this grand affair? in the Father, to give the Son of his love to &s;uffer and die for &s;inners, and in the Son to con&s;ent, and undertake? Is not the whole purcha&s;e, all of mere, &s;o|vereign grace and mercy as it re&s;pects &s;in|ners, in all their guilt and enmity again&s;t God? "While we were without &s;trength, in due time, Chri&s;t died for the <HI>ungodly.</HI>" "God commendeth his love, i. e. di&s;plays it to the very be&s;t advantage, in that while we were <HI>yet &s;inners,</HI> Chri&s;t died for us." Hence the apo&s;tle argues the certainty of the application of the &s;alvation thus purcha&s;ed for &s;inners, while in their <HI>very wor&s;t condition.</HI> Becau&s;e they were <HI>even then ju&s;tified,</HI> by the blood of Chri&s;t, before they knew any thing of it; before repentance, or faith, or regene|ration,
<PB N="118" REF="030609_0117_0FE82D378A969A10">
or any change in their hearts towards God: Ju&s;tified, I &s;ay, by Chri&s;t their &s;urety and Redeemer, in the pre&s;ence of God, long before they had any knowledge of it by faith; or any comfort in the great work that the &s;econd man had fini&s;hed. What can be plainer than the following words? "Much more then, being now ju&s;tified by his blood, we &s;hall be &s;aved from wrath through him. For if, <HI>when we were enemies, we were recon|ciled to God, by the death of his Son;</HI> much more <HI>being reconciled,</HI> we &s;hall be &s;aved by his life." Rom. v. 8, &amp;c. Thus the a|tonement is &s;o far from any thing incon&s;i&s;t|ent with free grace and mere mercy, that God thereby di&s;plays and communicates it to the utmo&s;t advantage, "<HI>commendeth his love.</HI>"</P>
<P>MEN often greatly derogate from the free grace which they be&s;tow, by the manner in which they communicate it. Your neighbor received from his father, as good an inheri|tance as you did from yours; and in both ca&s;es, the gift was of mere parental love, or free grace. Whenever he petitioned his fa|ther with regard to the expected plantation, he was an&s;wered with frowns, and kept much in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, for forty years. His father u&s;|ed often to tell him; "Son, I will have you to know, that I will make you &s;ure of noth|ing; I will keep you doubtful, and will do as I plea&s;e." After forty years, his father, at his death, left him the e&s;tate; but he might rather thank death for the comfort of his fortune, than his father.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="030609_0118_0FE82D1FB17F2868">YOUR father gave you ju&s;t as much, of his free grace likewi&s;e; but in a different mode. When you was twenty two years of age, he called you to him, and with a pa|ternal complacency in his countenance, ad|dre&s;&s;ed you thus. "My &s;on, you are &s;en&s;i|ble God has ble&s;&s;ed me with a plentiful e&s;tate, for which I wi&s;h ever to be thankful. One half of my e&s;tate is more than I can u&s;e to any advantage, otherwi&s;e than to com|municate comfort to others. You, my child, are in the bloom of youth, and I wi&s;h to make you as u&s;eful and happy as I can, in early life, and all your days; I have there|fore given and confirmed to you my hou&s;e in the next &s;treet, and the five hundred acres of land adjoining. The deed was executed la&s;t year; and that you may have the com|fort of your e&s;tate, and every encourage|ment and motive to indu&s;try and u&s;efulne&s;s, I now give you the deed, by which I have made the whole &s;ure to you." Then he gave you the in&s;trument under his hand and &s;eal, well executed: Adding; "paternal affec|tion is a mighty principle in the human &s;oul; I wi&s;h divine Providence may give you experience of it ere long, in dome&s;tic connection."

nor had tho&s;e encouragements and motives to indu&s;try; nor loved his father half &s;o well as you have yours. True, at la&s;t, when covered with gray hairs, he has received the &s;ame free grace from his father that you have from yours; but in a manner very dif|ferent. You had a title, by <HI>firm</HI> covenant in early life, founded on <HI>mere grace:</HI> He was kept at <HI>&s;overeign mercy,</HI> in di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;u&s;|pen&s;e until he was an old man, and then was made rich by <HI>free grace</HI> likewi&s;e. Now, my reader, is there not as much grace in the conduct of your father towards you, as your neighbor has experienced from his fa|ther? Was not the manner of communica|tion as gracious, and much more &s;o? Ju&s;t &s;o, our heavenly Father not only makes us rich by <HI>mere grace;</HI> but in the mo&s;t <HI>gracious manner,</HI> giving us all po&s;&s;ible &s;en&s;e of his in|finite good will; and all po&s;&s;ible comfort in the enjoyment; and every motive to gra|titude and u&s;efulne&s;s.

<P>NO per&s;on of ingenuity, will cavil at a &s;imilitude; becau&s;e it is not in all re&s;pects a re&s;emblance. None are &s;o. If they il|lu&s;trate the point aimed at, it is enough. The above is intended only to illu&s;trate this truth. viz. Much of mere grace lies in the manner of be&s;towment.</P>

has made; yet the grace connected with it, is, in every view, infinite, and di&s;played in a manner gracious in the highe&s;t degree. It is grace, free, &s;overeign grace, in the eternal coun&s;els of heaven: All grace in the decree: Grace in the gift, and in the undertaking: Infinite grace in all Chri&s;t has done and &s;uffered, as it re&s;pects &s;inners: Sovereign grace in their regeneration, conver&s;ion, the gift of repentance, faith, holine&s;s, con&s;ola|tion, per&s;everance, eternal glory: All grace, free grace, &s;overeign grace, un&s;earchable riches of grace, <HI>from God to man;</HI> though the Son hath a claim of righteou&s;ne&s;s on the Father, and pleads for the <HI>unju&s;t</HI> and the <HI>ungodly,</HI> on the ground of the covenant.

<P>IF we attend to the threefold office of our SAVIOR, as <HI>Prie&s;t, King,</HI> and <HI>Prophet</HI>; we &s;hall find the final &s;alvation of every human creature made &s;ure in him.</P>
<P>THAT Chri&s;t doth &s;u&s;tain the&s;e three di&s;|tinct offices, as our Redeemer, I &s;uppo&s;e, none will deny; &s;ince he is expre&s;sly de|&s;ignated by each of the&s;e appellations, in &s;a|cred &s;cripture, in a great many places; and &s;ince kings, prie&s;ts, and prophets, as types of Chri&s;t, &s;peak of his doings and &s;ufferings as their own, "They pierced my hands and my feet." "They &s;hall look on <HI>me</HI> whom they have pierced, and &s;hall mourn
<PB N="122" REF="030609_0121_0FE82D3E913CEB08">
for <HI>him.</HI>" "A prie&s;t forever, after the order of Melchi&s;edec." "Give thy judgments to the King." "A King &s;hall reign in right|eou&s;ne&s;s." "King of Kings." But I &s;up|po&s;e it wholly needle&s;s to adduce proof of this matter, and would only exhibit the de|mon&s;tration ari&s;ing from the character of Chri&s;t, as <HI>prophet, prie&s;t,</HI> and <HI>king.</HI> It is manife&s;t that <HI>all the&s;e offices are equal,</HI> as to their extent and operation. Chri&s;t is ju&s;t as far, and as exten&s;ively a King over man|kind, as he is a Prie&s;t and a Prophet; and as far as he doth exerci&s;e the&s;e offices at all, among the human kind, he doth exerci&s;e, and engage to exerci&s;e them all unto per|fection.</P>
<P>NOW, it is univer&s;ally allowed that Chri&s;t is a Prophet, Prie&s;t and King, in &s;ome re|&s;pect and in &s;ome degree, to <HI>all</HI> mankind; that the world enjoys many common favors through his atonement, and government of the world; and that all the light, know|ledge and in&s;truction mankind enjoy, is through him as his gift. But then, the <HI>lim|itarians</HI> would make one office of Chri&s;t, much le&s;s exten&s;ive than another. "His atonement, &s;ay they, is abundantly &s;ufficient for all. As a Prie&s;t, he wears an equal a&s;pect to all, pre&s;enting his infinite atone|ment to every man alike. As a King, he governs and will govern all creatures, by his almighty power, with uncontrouled ef|fect, according to his own will; either to make them dutiful &s;ubjects, or to puni&s;h them as rebels. He will di&s;po&s;e of all men,
<PB N="123" REF="030609_0122_0FE82D57C99D26B0">
and all things with an irre&s;i&s;tible arm; &s;aving only, that the moral di&s;po&s;itions of mo&s;t of the children of men &s;hall be exempt from his kingly government, and remain uncon|quered. He will &s;ubdue <HI>&s;ome things,</HI> but not <HI>all things,</HI> to him&s;elf. He will make <HI>&s;ome knees</HI> to bow, but not <HI>every knee.</HI> He will bring down <HI>&s;ome high thoughts,</HI> but not <HI>every high thought.</HI>" Thus they extend the <HI>&s;acer|dotal</HI> far beyond the <HI>regal</HI> office of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>AS to his <HI>prophetic</HI> office, they re&s;train and limit that very much indeed. They allow that he gives common light and knowledge to mankind in general; but not that &s;aving light which is, by way of di&s;tinction, called the <HI>true light.</HI> They allow that he is the <HI>common light,</HI> but <HI>not</HI> the "<HI>true light,</HI> that lighteth every man that cometh into the world." They will make a great di&s;tinction, or limitation, where the in&s;pired Evangeli&s;t makes none at all. They will not allow that "in him was life; and the life was the light of men," without a word of limitation. John i. 4. But make the three offices of Chri&s;t aforementioned, quite unequal, as to their extent and efficacy.</P>
<P>PAUL repre&s;ents the offices of Chri&s;t as co-exten&s;ive. Effectual calling is by virtue of the prophetic and kingly office of Chri&s;t: Ju&s;tification pertains to the &s;acerdotal, or prie&s;tly office, by the atonement: The &s;anc|tification, per&s;everance, and glorification of &s;inners, re&s;ult from all the offices of Chri&s;t alike. This apo&s;tle tells us that where one of the&s;e offices is exerci&s;ed, the other two are,
<PB N="124" REF="030609_0123_0FE82DB9328A2028">
in every in&s;tance. Rom. viii. "Whom he did prede&s;tinate, them he al&s;o called: and whom he called, them he al&s;o ju&s;tified: and whom he ju&s;tified, them he al&s;o glorified. What &s;hall we then &s;ay to the&s;e things? If God be for us, who can be again&s;t us? He that &s;pared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us ALL, how &s;hall he not with him al&s;o freely give us all things?"&mdash; "For I am per&s;uaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things pre&s;ent, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, &s;hall be able to &s;eparate us from the love of God which is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us our Lord." As to the extent of this love, we are left at no lo&s;s, being told that "God &s;o loved <HI>the world,</HI> that he gave his only begot|ten Son, that who&s;oever believeth in him &s;hould not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting life." If you would know how many &s;hall believe and be &s;aved, Je&s;us tells you in the next words: "For God &s;ent not his Son into <HI>the world</HI> to condemn <HI>the world,</HI> but that <HI>the world</HI> through him might be &s;aved. John iii. 16, l7. Would you know how far the light of Chri&s;t. and his prophetic office to mankind, &s;hall finally extend, &s;ee John i. 7. "The &s;ame came for a witne&s;s, to bear witne&s;s of the light, that <HI>all men</HI> through him might <HI>be|lieve:</HI>" The &s;ame is affirmed John xvii. 21.

<P>IT appears that "the head of <HI>every man</HI> is Chri&s;t," 1. Cor. xi. 3. and that in the cove|nant of redemption, all mankind were given to the <HI>Second Adam,</HI> as they were once inclu|ded in the, <HI>Fir&s;t;</HI> that he undertook to re|deem them by <HI>price,</HI> by <HI>power,</HI> and by <HI>appli|cation</HI> of the atonement he engaged to make; and which, in the fulne&s;s of time, he did make: That nothing can re&s;i&s;t his power as King eternal, immortal, invi&s;ible: That our whole &s;alvation is committed to him, in ev|ery view, and in every part of it, as <HI>Alpha</HI> and <HI>Omega,</HI> the beginning and the ending, the fir&s;t and the la&s;t: That "other founda|tion can no man lay than that which is laid, which is Je&s;us Chri&s;t:" That he is of one mind, and who can turn him? and what his &s;oul de&s;ireth, that he doeth: That of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: That he hath placed him&s;elf on the mountain of his holine&s;s and &s;trength, and that in his own time, he will take away the veil of darkne&s;s, and covering of ignorance, that hath been &s;pread over all the nations of the earth; and will &s;hew them that death, <HI>&s;piritual</HI> and <HI>eternal,</HI> is &s;wallowed up in vic|tory; and exhibit the go&s;pel fea&s;t of joy and glory to all the world.</P>
<P>THUS, as on a glorious and holy moun|tain, doth he take his &s;tation, and, in divine maje&s;ty and love, proclaim aloud, &s;aying,
<PB N="126" REF="030609_0125_0FE82D4114CAEFE0">
"In this mountain, &s;hall the Lord of ho&s;ts make unto <HI>all people</HI> a fea&s;t of fat things, a fea&s;t of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well re|fined; and he will de&s;troy, in this moun|tain, the face of the covering ca&s;t over all people, and the veil that is &s;pread over all nations. He will &s;wallow up death in victo|ry; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off <HI>all faces;</HI> and the rebuke of his people &s;hall he take away, from off <HI>all the earth:</HI> for the Lord hath &s;poken it.

I&s;ai. xxv. 6, &amp;c. This well agrees with what has been &s;aid of the progre&s;&s;ive manife&s;tations of grace and &s;alvation to men. Infinite wi&s;dom hath &s;een be&s;t to keep a veil and a covering over all nations, in a greater or le&s;s degree; and to draw it a&s;ide a little, by &s;low gradations, until the glorious removal of it, in full di&s;|play, on the mountain of the Lord.</P>
<P>THE certain &s;alvation of the human kind, may be argued from the doctrine of repent|ance, as preached by Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles.</P>
<P>ALL will allow that repentance is certainly connected with pardon and &s;alvation. Now, wherein does this certain connection con&s;i&s;t? Does it merit pardon? No: Does it at all change the eternal, immoveable purpo&s;e of
<PB N="127" REF="030609_0126_0FE82D5A464B8AB0">
God? No: Does repentance &s;ave us, as a meritorious good work, or good di&s;po&s;ition in the &s;oul? No: How then is repentance &s;urely connected with pardon and life? As God's ordinance, and as a fit temper of mind, without which, in the very nature of things, pardon and heaven it&s;elf could be no ble&s;&s;ing. This is, indeed, the true an&s;wer.</P>
<P>NOW, who gives repentance to &s;inners? Who makes this go&s;pel qualification &s;ure to them, before they go to heaven? Does it depend in the lea&s;t on them&s;elves? So far from this, their whole &s;ouls oppo&s;e it with all their might. Can any creature give it to another? No: Do &s;inners ever before they are penitent, do any thing to render it rea&s;onable that God &s;hould give to them re|pentance rather than to others? No. Re|pentance is a free, &s;overeign gift of God in Chri&s;t, who will have mercy on whom he will have mercy, for his own name's &s;ake, and for his own prai&s;e. And Je&s;us is ex|alted to grant this grace, ju&s;t as much as the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins, in con&s;equence of it. He gives the former, only as the nece&s;&s;ary chan|nel, or medium by which pardon and &s;al|vation can come to the &s;oul. The gift of this grace is ju&s;t as much within his com|mi&s;&s;ion, as <HI>Mediator</HI> and <HI>Savior</HI> of the world, Savior of all men, as is the be&s;towment of pardon and heaven. "Him hath God ex|alted, with his right hand, to be a Prince and a Savior, for to give repentance to <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> (all are <HI>&s;o,</HI> in union with Chri&s;t&punc; by human
<PB N="128" REF="030609_0127_0FE82DC2182D5C90">
nature, and by covenant) and forgivene&s;s of &s;ins." Acts v. 31.</P>
<P>THE prayer of Chri&s;t is efficacious. "Him the Father heareth alway." He has prayed for the pardon of tho&s;e that you would ex|clude, if you exclude any of the human kind; even <HI>Judas,</HI> and <HI>Pilate,</HI> and <HI>Herod,</HI> and the malicious chief Prie&s;ts, and mur|derous, bloody band of &s;oldiers, and all that mocked and derided him, on the day when be fini&s;hed the great work. For all the&s;e he &s;urely poured out an effectual, fervent pray|er; "Father forgive them, for they know not what they do." In this prayer which the Father certainly heard, (as he does alway without a &s;ingle exception) Je&s;us compre|hended every &s;inner in the world; for every &s;in doth crucify the Son of God. By this, and his other effectual interce&s;&s;ions, he en|&s;ured the promi&s;ed grace, to take hold of their hearts in his own time. "They &s;hall look on him whom they have pierced and mourn."</P>
<P>THE gift of repentance as well as of faith, and every other grace, is only that the &s;ure pardon and &s;alvation may be known&punc; and <HI>enjoyed</HI> by the &s;oul, in God's cho&s;en way, and in the only <HI>proper,</HI> or even <HI>po&s;&s;ible</HI> way. Thus, as <HI>peculiar to the go&s;pel,</HI> all men every where are commanded to repent. Acts xvii. 30. "And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now COMMANDETH ALL MEN EVERY WHERE to repent." Repentance is preached for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins, which remi&s;&s;ion was made as certain before as after|ward.
<PB N="129" REF="030609_0128_0FE82D47A2CE2800">
It was by the atonement of Chri&s;t a&s;certained, <HI>in it&s;elf</HI>; but by way of repent|ance it is made &s;en&s;ible to &s;inners.</P>
<P>CERTAINLY, repentance, <HI>as an exerci&s;e</HI> in the human &s;oul, does not create its own ob|ject, or lay its own foundation, any more than faith does, or love, or hope, or joy, or any grace whatever. They all agree in this, that they are all built on a firm foundation which they had no hand in laying. This foundation of God &s;tandeth as &s;ure, when the&s;e graces are not in exerci&s;e, as when they are, and before their implantation as after their utmo&s;t perfection. The foundation of God hath the &s;eal, <HI>not of alterations in crea|tures,</HI> but of his own eternal decree, and his knowledge of our &s;alvation founded thereon. Let the mind of man, <HI>at pre&s;ent,</HI> be in what &s;tate it may, "neverthele&s;s the foundation of God &s;tandeth &s;ure, having this &s;eal, the Lord knoweth them that are his."</P>
<P>WHEN all men are commanded every where to repent, no doubt, &s;aving, evangel|ical repentance, is the thing commanded, and this, we know, is the exerci&s;e of a new heart, and implies union with Chri&s;t by re|generation, or a new creation in him. The very command implies, that this is made &s;ure, and all the benefits connected with it, as what Chri&s;t has laid a foundation for. The doctrine preached is only a piece of good news, founded in <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>certainty,</HI> as all other go&s;pel doctrines are. The doctrine is an object of faith, as all other go&s;pel doc|trines
<PB N="130" REF="030609_0129_0FE82CDFA2C74E18">
are. It has a rea&s;onable duty con|nected with it; which is common to all go&s;pel doctrines.</P>
<P>WHEN the doctrine of repentance is preached for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins, this re|mi&s;&s;ion is always con&s;idered as &s;ure in Chri&s;t. Repentance as a fit temper of mind to re|ceive it and enjoy the benefit, is al&s;o en|gaged by him, who orders the doctrine to be preached. Chri&s;t con&s;iders all nations of the earth, and every human creature as re|conciled to God, by his blood, and God to them. What remains, in the preaching of the go&s;pel, is that they be brought to the knowledge, &s;en&s;e, and enjoyment of it, that it may have proper influence on their hearts.</P>
<P>BEFORE Peter thus under&s;tood the matter, he had an objection again&s;t preaching the doctrines of faith, repentance, and &s;alvation to the gentiles. He had no idea they had any right, <HI>&s;ecured in Chri&s;t,</HI> to the&s;e favors; therefore he had no news of that kind to tell them. His objection would have been founded in all the rea&s;on in the world, had the po&s;ition been true, that the gentiles were <HI>not clean&s;ed in Chri&s;t,</HI> and reconciled to God <HI>by him,</HI> and God to them. Had this been the ca&s;e, Peter ought not to have preached to them the go&s;pel of repentance and recon|ciliation. But Chri&s;t tells him, that his fun|damental principle in this matter was not true, forbidding him to a&s;&s;ert it again; "What God hath clean&s;ed that call not thou common;" i. e. <HI>unclean,</HI> or <HI>un&s;anctified</HI> in Chri&s;t; or unaccepted of God, <HI>in him.</HI> See
<PB N="131" REF="030609_0130_0FE82D4A3985CCB0">
the vi&s;ion of the &s;heet and its explanation, Acts x. and xi.</P>
<P>HENCE it appears that all mankind, "even <HI>while enemies,</HI> are <HI>reconciled</HI> to God, by the death of his Son, and much more, <HI>being reconciled,</HI> &s;hall be &s;aved by his life:" i. e. becau&s;e he lives at the Father's right hand, to make effectual application of his atonement, which he does by &s;ending his Spirit into the hearts of men, to renew them; and by conveying to them in his own time, the doctrines of repentance, faith, and every grace and virtue; and making the&s;e doctrines take effect. We are after recon|ciliation &s;aved by his life, <HI>much more,</HI> i. e. mo&s;t evidently and certainly, as he lives an almighty and faithful Savior, exalted with God's right hand, a Prince and Savior, to make <HI>application</HI> of the benefits of redemp|tion, to give repentance to his redeemed (called his I&s;rael) and forgivene&s;s of &s;ins.</P>
<P>REGENERATION, repentance, faith, love, hope, joy, every virtue, and every good work wrought in us, or exerci&s;ed by us, all agree in this, viz. They are all &s;o many fit and nece&s;&s;ary &s;teps, which the almighty Re|deemer takes with human &s;ouls, to acquaint them with his meritorious impetration, give them comfort in it, and affect them &s;uitably by it in their hearts and lives. There is no &s;trict propriety in preaching any of the&s;e doctrines <HI>as go&s;pel,</HI> i. e. as news founded in facts, that ought to be believed; unle&s;s all is made true and &s;ure in Chri&s;t before we have any acquaintance with the tidings, or
<PB N="132" REF="030609_0131_0FE82D096CB81AD8">
any operation from them. The whole preaching of the go&s;pel in every article of it, is only the announcing of immutable truth, not created or altered by our hearing of it. Which truth it is good for us to know, and hath a good effect and con|&s;equence.</P>
<P>IN hearing the doctrine of repentance, we learn the nature of it; the good effect of it in our great comfort and u&s;efulne&s;s; the meet fruits of it, which are all very good; and al&s;o that Chri&s;t is exalted by God's right-hand to give it to the world, who&s;e &s;ins he died to take away. Thus the pardon comes, to their conviction and com|fort, by the doctrine of repentance for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins.</P>
<P>THEY, who would make repentance faith, regeneration, or any other grace, means ne|ce&s;&s;ary to our &s;alvation, &s;ay right. But they who make them terms of di&s;tinction <HI>in us,</HI> to give us a &s;ure title to &s;alvation, put our &s;afety now on the &s;ame footing or ground, on which Adam &s;tood at fir&s;t, as to the ge|neral nature and rea&s;on of it. Adam mu&s;t have had a good heart and a good life, and then he would have been &s;afe; yet <HI>all</HI> would have been <HI>of God's grace,</HI> or free gift, as every body will allow: For his whole being was &s;o.

&s;ame general ground, and in a good degree too. The degree alters not the nature or ground of our &s;afety: The general rea&s;on is wholly the &s;ame. Both &s;tand on per&s;onal qualifications.</P>
<P>BUT the truth is, Adam &s;tood wholly on his per&s;onal qualifications: We &s;tand wholly on tho&s;e of Chri&s;t; and enjoy the comfort and operation of them, by regeneration, faith, repentance, and every virtue. To &s;up|po&s;e otherwi&s;e, is, at be&s;t, falling into the <HI>neonomian</HI> &s;cheme. The retainers of which, &s;ay, that the terms of our acceptance with God, are much lowered &s;ince the fall of Adam, the conditions much mitigated; but that we &s;tand upon per&s;onal qualifications, &s;uch as they be, <HI>in the go&s;pel demand,</HI> as much as Adam did, on the higher qualifica|tions of the fir&s;t covenant.</P>
<P>ANY impartial mind, with proper atten|tion, will &s;ee, that we fall into the &s;elf &s;ame doctrine, as to the general and real nature of it, if we in&s;i&s;t on any kind or degree of qualifications in creatures, as <HI>terms</HI> of ac|ceptance with God; or, otherwi&s;e than as the work of God's almighty power, and free grace in us, in order to give us the know|ledge of our previous acceptance with God in Chri&s;t alone; and to form and attemper our &s;ouls to the enjoyment of life and eter|nal &s;alvation, made &s;ure by the covenant of redemption, and the faithful engagement of the Son of God, and &s;ealed on his cro&s;s. If we depart from this plan of hope, it is indifferent whether we call our&s;elves <HI>papi&s;ts</HI>
<PB N="134" REF="030609_0133_0FE82CEFC40D1FE8">
or <HI>prote&s;tants, arminians</HI> or <HI>calvini&s;ts&punc; neono|mians, antinomians, new divinity men</HI>&punc; or <HI>qua|kers;</HI> ina&s;much as we &s;hall all agree in the grand principle, the cardinal point: viz. <HI>That our acceptance with God&punc; and our certain &s;alvation, does re&s;t on valuable qualification&punc; whereby we are di&s;tingui&s;hed from other men.</HI> Yet all agreeing in this, even that God by his mere mercy and free grace, hath made the &s;aving di&s;tinction. Thus we all, in our hearts, join with him of old in plea&s;ing de|votion; "God I thank thee that I am not as other men." He acknowledged the free grace of God, as much as any <HI>limitarian</HI> ever did.</P>
<P>IT is a further &s;ymptom that the way of life I am pleading for, is agreeable to the go&s;pel; that believing in it will certainly make us hate all &s;in, all ungodline&s;s. Or to &s;peak with more accurate propriety, where this faith is, there certainly will be a bitter hatred and aver&s;ion to all ungodline&s;s. The very di&s;covery of God which I am &s;peaking of, that view of the Redeemer, that exhibi|tion of the divine character, nece&s;&s;arily in|volves in it a perception and &s;en&s;e of infi|nite amiablene&s;s, beauty and glory. The infinite loveline&s;s of God, and &s;alvation by grace through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, are the e&s;&s;ential objects of the faith I maintain. This wholly agrees with the old calvini&s;tic doctrine of &s;aving faith. No acquaintance with God or divine truth, without a feeling impre&s;&s;ion of the divine loveline&s;s on our &s;ouls, was ever
<PB N="135" REF="030609_0134_0FE82CF14CF732D8">
thought to be &s;aving faith, by <HI>Calvin, Owen,</HI> or any eminent promoters of the prote&s;tant cau&s;e. Their object of faith is exactly the &s;ame which I contend for; and the manner of communication and operation is the &s;ame, as wrought by the power of God, working by love, and purifying the heart, even as God is pure.</P>
<P>WE do not con&s;ider a&s;&s;urance of our &s;al|vation to be of the e&s;&s;ence of &s;aving faith; but merely con&s;equential, even as hath been u&s;ual with prote&s;tants. The faith we con|tend for, has nothing immediately and di|rectly to do with our&s;elves, but with the object of our faith. When this faith is wrought in us, by the power and grace of God, and proper fruits en&s;ue; thence we argue our own &s;afe e&s;tate by way of con&s;e|quence, and &s;o make our calling and elec|tion &s;ure. We unite with the orthodox in all ages, in &s;aying, that hatred of all &s;in is the fruit of faith; or that &s;aving knowledge and &s;upreme love of God are through faith.</P>
<P>THE univer&s;al extent of Chri&s;t's &s;aving power and grace, is further taught us by metaphors and emblems, which the divine Spirit hath made u&s;e of in the word. As that of the <HI>dew,</HI> the <HI>wind,</HI> the <HI>rain,</HI> &amp;c. which are known to be of univer&s;al extent over the whole earth, at &s;uch various times and in &s;uch manner as God is plea&s;ed to direct. Perhaps no emblem is more &s;ignifi|cant than that of a <HI>&s;un,</HI> often made u&s;e of in the &s;criptures, as P&s;alm lxxxiv. 11. "For

<P>SIMILITUDES do not quadrate in all re|&s;pects with the things illu&s;trated by them; but wherein they do, we may argue with &s;afety. Take the &s;imilitudes now referred to, and we &s;hall find univer&s;al extent and operation, to be principal ideas &s;ugge&s;ted. A comment might be made on each of them, perhaps, with equal propriety. Omitting the re&s;t, take that of <HI>a &s;un.</HI> It very well pre&s;ents to our view the Sun of righteou&s;|ne&s;s, the great Redeemer, in the extent, and benign efficacy of his mediatorial character.</P>
<P>THE &s;un is an object highly exalted above the world: So is Chri&s;t highly exalted. The &s;un is the fountain of light to the world: So is Chri&s;t the brightne&s;s of his Father's glory and the expre&s;s image of his per&s;on. The natural &s;un revives, quickens, gives life to all things in the natural world: So doth Chri&s;t with regard to the whole &s;pi|ritual world. The &s;un hath various times and &s;ea&s;ons of &s;pecial influence, and does di&s;pen&s;e his favors variou&s;ly to various parts of the world, at different times, &s;ea&s;ons, and periods: So it is with the Sun of righteou&s;|ne&s;s, in the &s;piritual world. Under the influence of the &s;un in the firmament, there is the vernal and the autumnal &s;ea&s;on, the &s;ummer and the winter, the darkne&s;s and the light, in various degrees, and the heat and cold in perpetual variation: So it is with
<PB N="137" REF="030609_0136_0FE82D8871AFA678">
the various di&s;plays and di&s;pen&s;ations of the great Redeemer, the Sun of righteou&s;|ne&s;s. Something of this has been taken notice of before in the gradual progre&s;&s;ion of go&s;pel light; and in the decrees of God, making many and great di&s;tinctions among mankind in this world, both of an outward and of a &s;piritual nature, and al&s;o in the world to come, with re&s;pect to degrees of exaltation and glory; though none as to the certainty of future &s;alvation, to the body of Chri&s;t, who is the "head of every man."</P>
<P>THE natural &s;un is certainly and greatly beneficial to the whole world; though not to every part in the &s;ame manner and de|gree. The frigid zones &s;eem lea&s;t of all to feel the ble&s;&s;ings of that glorious luminary; though they have their day, and a long one, and many other benefits derived from the &s;un. The torrid zone is, on the whole, fa|vored far beyond tho&s;e la&s;t mentioned, in many re&s;pects; yet the inhabitants of tho&s;e climates have not near &s;o many benefits from the &s;un as the regions included in the tem|perate zones. Moreover, each of tho&s;e parts of the earth, is more ble&s;&s;ed with the benign influences of the &s;un at one time than at another; and all of them more in the day time than in the night; more in the &s;erene and clear day than in the dark and gloomy day. Many other remarks of this kind, will naturally occur to the mind of the reader.</P>
<P>IT is to be ob&s;erved, in general, that there is no &s;ea&s;on of the year, no period of
<PB N="138" REF="030609_0137_0FE82D5FC41987B0">
time, no hour in the &s;tormy day, or mid|night darkne&s;s, in which any part of the world is left wholly without any benefit, or even con&s;iderable benefit from the &s;un. Even in dead of winter, the &s;un is a great ble&s;&s;ing to men: So even at the darke&s;t or colde&s;t midnight, it is neither &s;o dark nor &s;o cold as it would be if there were no &s;un. When any particular climate &s;uffers mo&s;t in the ab&s;ence of the &s;un, yet the inhabitants of that particular climate, have &s;uch a con|nection with the world in general, and with tho&s;e parts of the world where, at the &s;ame time, the influence of the &s;un is mo&s;t replete with ble&s;&s;ings, that they receive great ben|efit, though in a mediate and direct way. Each part of the world has at &s;ome times, the immediate and direct beams of the &s;un; at other times his indirect and reflected in|fluence, by the moon and &s;tars. And, even when the&s;e appear not, &s;till many and great benefits are derived to them; without which they would be far more mi&s;erable than they ever yet were, in their mo&s;t torpid or be|nighted circum&s;tances. They always have &s;ome "<HI>precious things brought forth by the &s;un.</HI>" Ju&s;t &s;o with regard to the "true light which enlighteneth every man that cometh into the world." The Lord is good to all; and his tender mercies are over all his works. All the human kind are at all times much the better for Chri&s;t. He hath always a de&s;ire to the work of his hands.</P>
<P>THE covenant people of God, under every di&s;pen&s;ation, may be compared to tho&s;e cli|mates
<PB N="139" REF="030609_0138_0FE82DC6E3E5D1C0">
and regions mo&s;t peculiarly under the ble&s;&s;ings of the natural &s;un. Different di&s;|pen&s;ations among them compare with dif|ferent &s;ea&s;ons of the year. Special provi|dences, propitious or adver&s;e, are like the interchange of calm &s;un&s;hine and angry &s;torms. The fir&s;t openings of divine rev|elation are &s;imilar to the fir&s;t &s;treaks of dawning day: Increa&s;ing light is like the gray of the morning. The jewi&s;h di&s;pen|&s;ation was, at fir&s;t, like the horizontal beams of the ri&s;ing &s;un. As light was added, under that di&s;pen&s;ation, the &s;un advanced towards the meridian. Chri&s;t and the in&s;pired apo&s;|tles, with the light at that time poured in upon the world, may compare with the &s;un in his &s;trength. "His countenance was as the &s;un &s;hineth in his &s;trength." "I am come a light into the world." And "ye are the light of the world." There is much in &s;acred writ to &s;upport this analogy.</P>
<P>AS it is demon&s;trated concerning the &s;un in the firmament, that his influence is more inten&s;e &s;ome time after the meridian is pa&s;t, than before; &s;o the ble&s;&s;ings of the great Redeemer have been increa&s;ing, &s;ince he was on earth in the form of man, &s;ince "he a&s;|cended up on high, led captivity captive, and received gifts for men; <HI>yea for the</HI> RE|BELLIOUS <HI>al&s;o,</HI> that the Lord God might dwell among them." P&s;alm lxviii. 18.</P>
<P>EVERY part of the pagan world, all na|tions of the earth unacquainted with divine revelation directly or immediately, have in|directly &s;omething valuable of the &s;ame
<PB N="140" REF="030609_0139_0FE82D9A0BB8ABE0">
light and knowledge, in various degrees and mea&s;ures, by connection with the people of God, more or le&s;s, by tradition, communi|cation, &amp;c. Even as every part of the earth, has always, both in winter and &s;um|mer, in every &s;ea&s;on of the year, by day and by night, &s;ome benefit more or le&s;s from the &s;un: if not by his direct beams, yet by the reflected or refracted. There are no people in the world, but what have &s;ome religion. Yet probably there never would have been any in the world, had there been no revelation from God. Yea, perhaps, the exi&s;tence of a God would never have been thought of, had he made no &s;ort of revelation more than in the works of nature and providence. It has been the opinion of &s;ome of the greate&s;t of men, that the fir&s;t intimation of a Supreme Being, was owing to divine revelation: Although, when the hint was thus given, the nations of the earth, with this leading thought, could demon&s;trate his exi&s;tence from the works of nature. However this may be, there is no nation on earth, which is not enlightened by Chri&s;t, in &s;ome degree or other, by his word, &s;pirit and providence, in &s;uch manner as infinite wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s hath &s;een be&s;t. In this &s;en&s;e is the apo&s;tle to be under&s;tood, when he &s;ays, "the go&s;pel was preached to every creature under heaven." For this never had been done by expre&s;s revelation, or di|rect communication of the knowledge of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>ALL mankind have &s;ome religion, which
<PB N="141" REF="030609_0140_0FE82CF6D9510C70">
came to them through Chri&s;t; though many have never heard of his name. All people know the truth, in &s;ome degree. All are orthodox in &s;ome points, and right in &s;ome mea&s;ure. God manife&s;ts him&s;elf, and gives knowledge and in&s;truction of all kinds, to the inhabi|tants of this world, and indeed to all intel|ligent creatures, only in and through Chri&s;t. All common &s;en&s;e, all extraordinary endow|ments of mind, all &s;cience and learning, all new inventions of every kind, all acquaint|ance with moral and &s;piritual things, are by Chri&s;t. Hence he is called the word of God; becau&s;e as men convey knowledge and in|&s;truction by their words, &s;o doth God by the Mediator.</P>
<P>WHEN man fell, he was then immediately in total darkne&s;s, as to any impre&s;&s;ions on his mind, or mental exerci&s;es that might profit him. The mediation of Chri&s;t began that very moment. The guilty pair were immediately put in better circum&s;tances, by the Son of God, than otherwi&s;e they would have been. And it is the general opinion of divines, I think, with good rea&s;on, that they were &s;oon regenerated and brought back to the &s;aving knowledge of God, in a way of &s;pecial illumination, repentance, and faith. There was, however, a ble&s;&s;ed degree of the power and influence of the Mediator on their minds, immediately after their fall; and there ever has been on the minds and di&s;po&s;itions of all their children. None have ever been nearly &s;o bad, as if there had been no Mediator. Common grace, as we term

it, having always been an un&s;peakable favor to all the fallen race. And this is as truly and really by and through Chri&s;t, as eternal &s;alvation is.</P>
<P>THE influence of the Second Adam, the Lord from heaven, on the hearts of men, has always been &s;overeign, and very various; as much &s;o as the light and influence of the &s;un on the earth has been in the various parts of it, and in the various &s;ea&s;ons of the year: Yet all are much the better for the Sun of righteou&s;ne&s;s. It is a univer&s;al pro|po&s;ition and every where true, that "the people that walked in darkne&s;s have &s;een a great light;" i. e. with a vi&s;ion more or le&s;s perfect; with &s;ome degree of illumination; "and they that dwell in the land of the &s;ha|dow of death, upon them hath the light &s;hined." So in I&s;aiah li. when God &s;peaks of his fixed determination to &s;ave &s;inners, his e&s;tabli&s;hed purpo&s;e and judgment in that matter, he &s;aith,"I will make my judgment to re&s;t for a light to the people, my right|eou&s;ne&s;s is near&punc; my &s;alvation is gone forth, and mine arms &s;hall judge the people. The i&s;les &s;hall wait upon me, and on mine arms &s;hall they tru&s;t." "My &s;alvation &s;hall be forever: and my righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall not be aboli&s;hed." "My righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall be forever, and my &s;alvation from generation to generation."</P>
<P>THE MOST HIGH &s;peaks of the light of Chri&s;t, as a growing and &s;preading light, until, in the end, all the world &s;hall behold his glorious beams, and feel his &s;aving

"And the gentiles &s;hall come to thy light, and kings to the bright|ne&s;s of thy ri&s;ing." "The abundance of the &s;ea &s;hall be converted unto thee; the forces of the gentiles &s;hall come unto thee." "Who are the&s;e that fly as a cloud, and as the doves to their windows? Surely the i&s;les &s;hall wait for me, and the &s;hips of Tar&s;hi&s;h fir&s;t, to bring thy &s;ons from far." And it is ob|&s;ervable, as God is &s;peaking of his covenant mercies in Chri&s;t to the ends of the earth, it is &s;ubjoined towards the clo&s;e of the chap|ter, "Thy SUN &s;hall no more go down, neither &s;hall thy moon withdraw it&s;elf: for the Lord &s;hall be thine everla&s;ting light, and the days of thy mourning &s;hall be ended." And to the &s;ame purpo&s;e it is &s;aid, "The earth &s;hall be filled with the know|ledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the &s;ea."</P>
<P>IN all this provi&s;ion, and diffu&s;ion <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;aving light and grace to men, God is as free and &s;overeign as in creating the &s;un in the firmament, and in di&s;po&s;ing of all his benefits. And as "he maketh his &s;un to ri&s;e on the evil and on the good," &s;o like|wi&s;e hath he no regard to any di&s;tinction &s;een in the human kind, in the be&s;towment of &s;aving mercy. Many differences is he plea&s;ed to make in this world, and that as becometh his holy &s;overeignty; but none, <HI>none at all,</HI> as to the final extent of &s;alvation, or the efficacy of the Sun of righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="030609_0143_0FE7EC2CE6BFB550">THE DOCTRINE OF THE TOTAL DEPRAVITY OF HUMAN NATURE&punc; is &s;o plain a &s;cripture doctrine, that we cannot deny it, without re|jecting the whole authority of divine reve|lation.</P>
<P>THE doctrine is this: That the whole hu|man nature, included in the fir&s;t man, was, by the fall, left totally de&s;titute of any moral or &s;piritual good; and that fallen man became as bad in a moral view, as fallen angels, at their fir&s;t apo&s;tacy, according to their inferior natural capacity.</P>
<P>THE angels who had fallen &s;ometime be|fore man, had increa&s;ed their wickedne&s;s, by the exerci&s;es of it; and man was in the like &s;ure way to increa&s;e his, and by the &s;ame cau&s;e. Every power, every faculty of the &s;oul, was left without any, the lea&s;t degree of moral good; all dreadfully polluted; "every imagination of the thought of man's heart was evil only, and that continually." The depravity was total. And there was nothing left in the &s;oul of man, of a moral kind, but enmity again&s;t God. I &s;hould here take up the demon&s;tration of this at large, were it not &s;o fully done already, by the mo&s;t able divines, in a way of the plain|e&s;t &s;cripture rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>I HAVE &s;aid, and I here repeat it, the mediation of Chri&s;t, in favor of all human nature, began the moment after the fall. In Adam and Eve was all human na|ture included&punc; or, in Adam alone: For the woman was from him. Chri&s;t, by his merciful energy, began immediately to with|&s;tand
<PB N="145" REF="030609_0144_0FE82D9060F19800">
the force of man's depravity, and has done &s;o ever &s;ince, in a greater or le&s;s de|gree, in all human nature, in every child of Adam. Otherwi&s;e, mankind would all be as bad as the devils, according to their mea|&s;ure of being; but we know they are not. The Mediator was a &s;overeign in the mea&s;ure of good influence he granted at fir&s;t to the fallen pair, and in all additional mea&s;ures of grace of what kind &s;oever; and is &s;o &s;till, and always will be, as it highly becomes his character always, and in every thing, to keep up a view of his holy &s;overeignty. At what time he regenerated the &s;ouls of our fir&s;t parents, we cannot &s;ay, or what mea&s;ures of grace he was plea&s;ed to give them while they lived.</P>
<P>HE now gives unto &s;ome, much more of his kind influence from their infancy, than others; and to &s;ome increa&s;ing favors of this kind, all their days. Some have le&s;s and le&s;s of it all their days, and &s;o grow wor&s;e and wor&s;e. But none, in this life, are ever found without &s;ome degree of grace or favor from the Mediator; &s;uch as preventing goodne&s;s, re&s;training grace, &s;ome checks of con&s;cience, &s;ome humanity and kindne&s;s to their fellow men. Be it granted that all this is from merely &s;elfi&s;h motives, and de&s;|titute of all moral good, and that there is &s;in worthy of damnation, in regard to defi|ciency, in all their honor and hone&s;ty, in all their indu&s;try and the public good they do&punc; and in all the benefits they communicate.
<PB N="146" REF="030609_0145_0FE82D91EA40B238">
Grant all this, which indeed is true; yet there is much of the grace of the Mediator in hin|dering their being and doing wor&s;e. Chri&s;t, by his providence and &s;pirit, mercifully and powerfully re&s;i&s;ts the awful force of their depravity, at all times, even though he has not yet renewed them in a &s;aving manner.</P>
<P>TO illu&s;trate the above remarks. God &s;ays to Abimelech, "I with-held thee from &s;inning again&s;t me." Though he was guilty of great &s;in in all he did, even in di&s;mi&s;&s;ing the wife of the patriarch, not doing even that in faith and from a principle of friend|&s;hip to God; yet a ble&s;&s;ed degree of God's grace was granted him. God in his pro|vidence, and, it &s;hould &s;eem, by &s;ome &s;pecial influence on his mind and inclinations, kept him from a great &s;in, There never was any man on earth left to the whole force of his natural depravity: No, not Cain, or Ahab, or Jezebel, or Judas him&s;elf. If otherwi&s;e, Cain would have killed his parents as well as his brother; Ahab would have murdered many be&s;ides Naboth, thou&s;ands more than ever he did. Jezebel's whoredoms and witch|crafts were many; but they would have been many more, had not the Mediator's grace re&s;i&s;ted. And, were it not for this grace, Judas would have been a much greater thief and murderer than he was. It was this that made him repent, and bear his la&s;t te&s;timony in favor of the Redeemer. And even this good almighty government of Chri&s;t &s;o ordered, that he hanged him&s;elf,
<PB N="147" REF="030609_0146_0FE82D9777FB8EE8">
before he had further added to his wicked|ne&s;s; though this was done by the in&s;tru|mentality of &s;atan, as the immediate agent.</P>
<P>THE reader may now want I &s;hould &s;hew, if I can, that Judas did not go to an eternal hell. I will take notice of this, in its proper place, and &s;o of every thing el&s;e that he may think of, as he goes along&punc; as impatient to have at that moment di&s;cu&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>BUT, not to digre&s;s further, I would add concerning the grace which the Mediator afforded even Judas, in his highe&s;t pitch of wickedne&s;s. Had it not been for the gra|cious, re&s;i&s;ting power of Chri&s;t, he would have boa&s;ted of his trea&s;on; &s;trengthened his malice; been foremo&s;t, with his own hands, in nailing Je&s;us to the cro&s;s; been the loude&s;t to mock and deride his dying agonies; and then gone on to murder all the di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t: And where would he have made a &s;tand? Surely not until he had hanged him&s;elf, which he would have done at la&s;t. The &s;ame may be &s;aid or the mo&s;t horrid mon&s;ters of wickedne&s;s that ever have been in the world; <HI>Herod, Nero, Alexander, Richard</HI> IIId. of Britain, <HI>Beadle, Benedict Arnold,</HI> &amp;c. Not one of the&s;e, or any other on earth, were ever, in any mea|&s;ure, &s;o horribly wicked as they would have been, had all re&s;traints been taken off. And all the re&s;traints that ever were kept upon the wicked, are by the grace and power of the Mediator, and the purcha&s;e of his blood. The mercy, power, pity&punc; and grace of the Redeemer is great and wonderful, even
<PB N="148" REF="030609_0147_0FE82DC86C5B1658">
where &s;ouls are not renewed. "The Lord is good unto all; and his tender mercies are over all his works."</P>
<P>I READILY grant there is a difference <HI>in kind, a &s;pecific difference</HI> between common, and &s;aving grace; or that grace which the renewed have, and that which is common to men. But in the&s;e particulars they do in|deed agree; both are free: Both are good, and valuable in their nature: Both from God only through Chri&s;t: Both wholly un|merited by &s;inners: Both be&s;towed on &s;in|ners who have equal dependence on God: Both are the fruit of the Mediator's under|taking for a guilty world, be&s;towed in God's own time and manner. So that the great excellency of one above the other, does not, in the lea&s;t, militate again&s;t the pre&s;ent ar|gument, to prove a real connection of the Me&s;&s;iah in a foederal way with all mankind; but does fully confirm this doctrine, even as fully as if there was no &s;pecific difference between them.</P>
<P>THERE are innumerable good things of a nature &s;pecifically different, that are equally the gift and grace of the Mediator, as wi&s;|dom and wealth; health and a good name; all the five &s;en&s;es: All the&s;e are good, and all alike from the Son of God, as Creator and Governor of the world. Man could have enjoyed no good at all, had not a Me|diator interpo&s;ed; but the cur&s;e&punc; in its mo&s;t literal, plaine&s;t meaning&punc; would have been executed. God was able to make A|dam and Eve under&s;tand what he &s;aid to
<PB N="149" REF="030609_0148_0FE82CE5C565E5A0">
them. They knew what was meant by the word <HI>day</HI>; and God was able to make them under&s;tand what was meant by the word <HI>die,</HI> or <HI>death.</HI> Otherwi&s;e he did, in effect, &s;ay nothing to them. If he did not make them under&s;tand him, there was no threatening at all, <HI>as to them,</HI> in what he &s;aid. They knew the day meant twenty-four hours, or a diur|nal, apparent revolution of the &s;un. God made them to under&s;tand, that to <HI>die,</HI> &s;igni|fied, with re&s;pect to the body, a total ce&s;&s;a|tion of all vital functions, all &s;en&s;ibility; and, with re&s;pect to the &s;oul, the total lo&s;s of his moral image. and his favor forever more, with the mi&s;eries connected therewith, and the eternal pains due to the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of his holy and good law.</P>
<P>WHEN they had &s;inned, they really ex|pected that, within that very day, as now de&s;cribed, their bodies would &s;o die; and that, as they found their &s;ouls deprived of the moral image of God, they would for|ever remain &s;o, with all the angui&s;h and &s;orrow, pain and di&s;tre&s;s, contained in the malediction, to all eternity; even a duration ab&s;olutely interminable. This appeared in their fearful conduct, when "they heard the voice of the Lord God, walking in the gar|den in the cool of the day," i. e. in the latter part of that very day on which they rebelled.</P>
<P>No doubt, they thought he was come to execute the &s;entence upon them, ju&s;t as he had &s;poken&punc; and as they plainly under&s;tood. And they knew that this was ju&s;t and right|eous. But, to their great and joyful &s;urprize,
<PB N="150" REF="030609_0149_0FE82DCFDD699A20">
they found it quite otherwi&s;e. A dark inti|mation was given them, in an indirect man|ner, of the ground God proceeded upon, to avoid the violation of his honor and truth, viz. a &s;ub&s;titute, a vicar, an atonement, one in their place and &s;tead, the &s;eed of the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">. The Mediator began to officiate that moment for all the human kind. They were all pre&s;ent, all in the fir&s;t pair. And he has con&s;tantly officiated for all the human kind ever &s;ince, and will until the cur&s;e is wholly wiped away. Sin reigned unto death, even then immediately upon the fall; and grace began its operation on the &s;ame day, and &s;hall reign with an overcoming, pre|vailing triumph, to the end of the world, and to all eternity. "That as &s;in hath reigned unto death, even &s;o might grace reign through righteou&s;ne&s;s, unto eternal life, by Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord." Rom. v. 21.</P>
<P>AT what time our fir&s;t parents were re|newed, is immaterial to the pre&s;ent argu|ment; but it is certain the Me&s;&s;iah on that very day, operated, in a ble&s;&s;ed and merciful degree. He &s;pared their lives. They did not die an immediate and remedile&s;s death, as they de&s;erved, and expected from God's own mouth. On that day, they were gra|ciou&s;ly pointed to an atonement. The great high Frie&s;t exhibited an oblation before their eyes; the import of which was, that one of their &s;eed &s;hould be divinely qualified for a full atonement, and his death &s;hould &s;tand for theirs. Then he took the &s;kins of tho&s;e bea&s;ts which were &s;lain, and clothed
<PB N="151" REF="030609_0150_0FE82D614C4E96C8">
them. Which denoted that they were ac|cepted, not in their own fig leaves, a garment of their own preparing, their own vile char|acter; but in the character of the future Me&s;|&s;iah, the cloathing or garments of his all per|fect righteou&s;ne&s;s. Much grace and mercy was granted them on that very day; and more added, as a gracious Sovereign &s;aw proper. So it is with all their poor, lo&s;t children. They have always much mercy and grace from Chri&s;t; and he goes on to the con&s;um|mation of it as a gracious <HI>Sovereign.</HI></P>
<P>ALL this is only in a go&s;pel way; and &s;o "the go&s;pel was preached to every creature under heaven," even from the fall of man. i. e. Go&s;pel grace was always manife&s;ted, or held forth, to all human creatures, in &s;ome degree or other. And where Chri&s;t begins a good work, as Mediator, he will perfect it, in his own way and time. It will i&s;&s;ue in perfection at the great day. "Being confi|dent of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you, will perform it until the day of Je&s;us Chri&s;t." Phil. i. 6.</P>
<P>IT is moreover evidential that this is the doctrine of grace and &s;alvation; becau&s;e this, and this only, excludes all boa&s;ting. <HI>Good di&s;tinctions</HI> are the <HI>only</HI> things that men boa&s;t of, or at lea&s;t, what they value as good. If they come in a way of mere grace, with|out any hand of theirs in them, they always feel more pride in them, than if they came by their own good efforts. How proud are mankind of exqui&s;ite beauty; noble birth;
<PB N="152" REF="030609_0151_0FE82DD25E101B20">
a grand e&s;tate de&s;cended down from an an|cient and dignified family? Every body knows that good things of this nature are all of mere favor or grace, pure gifts of God, in the way of nature and providence.</P>
<P>SAY of a man, that he is de&s;cended of the mo&s;t honorable family in the nation; that he has naturally the greate&s;t powers of mind of any man in it; that he carries the greate&s;t maje&s;ty, dignity and beauty in his countenance, and in all his ge&s;tures, together with the mo&s;t unaffected, winning behavior; that in vigor and activity, he exceeds all: Add that he was made &s;o, he was born with all this greatne&s;s and excellence in his very nature; and is indeed the complete&s;t work of God to be found within a thou&s;and miles. You can &s;ay nothing that will take hold of the human heart, to make a man feel proud|er; though you have not &s;aid one word, but what is an expre&s;&s;ion of free, &s;overeign grace, as the man him&s;elf will acknowledge. Indeed, he is much the prouder, on this very con&s;ideration, that &s;o great a Being as GOD him&s;elf, has taken &s;uch peculiar notice of him, and &s;ingled him out as a &s;pecial favorite.</P>
<P>LET another man hear it &s;aid of him, that he was in every view mean and contempti|ble by nature; de&s;picable in &s;oul and body throughout; of a &s;candalous family from generation to generation; but he has taken &s;o much pains to become &s;omething, that he is really now, a man that ought to be re|&s;pected, indeed a very worthy man. He
<PB N="153" REF="030609_0152_0FE82D4ED1BDCB38">
will hardly thank you for the compliment; though you attribute the whole of his virtue and worth to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>VERY great di&s;tinction from others, in honor, and happine&s;s, is what men mo&s;t pride them&s;elves in; and if this be owing to the peculiar notice of &s;ome great per&s;on|age, it really adds to their gratification. Men are naturally proud of being peculiar favorites of the great. Mr. POPE, the cele|brated poet, was a man more free from vanity, than mo&s;t men; but he betrayed much on an occa&s;ion, and at a time when it was lea&s;t to be expected. In writing his la&s;t will, when his thoughts were full of ap|proaching death and another world, his pride is apparently moved by a matter of free, &s;o|vereign grace, a peculiar mark of di&s;tinction from a king. In the beque&s;t of a valuable ring, which might have been quite as well de&s;cribed without telling how he came by it, he &s;ays, "<HI>the ring which the king of Sardinia gave me.</HI>" All the poets u&s;ed to &s;peak in like manner, and they expre&s;&s;ed human nature. If they had received only a pipe, or any other &s;mall matter of a re|nowned poet, or any man of great note, as a free gift; they would be &s;ure to take no|tice of the manner in which it came to them, valuing them&s;elves on the mere gracious di&s;tinction of a renowned man. Such is human nature.</P>
<P>TELL a man that he is bad, how ready is he to keep him&s;elf in countenance, by enu|merating
<PB N="154" REF="030609_0153_0FE82DD8225C2868">
many that do as he does! If he thought him&s;elf di&s;tingui&s;hed from mo&s;t others in wickedne&s;s, he would be far more a&s;hamed. Whether it re&s;pects pride or &s;hame, <HI>peculiar di&s;tinction</HI> is the grand thing; and if that di&s;tinction come in a &s;overeign way, from a great <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> it is not the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> the more flattering. To be mean, de&s;picable, and contemptible by birth and nature, or to be e&s;teemed &s;o, mortifies human pride, more than to be &s;o in any other way. Hence men are more mortified to be called fools, than knaves or cunning rogues. It is indeed, di&s;tinction from others in a way of excellence, real or &s;uppo&s;ed, that is in every ca&s;e, a &s;trong temptation to pride, in what|ever way that di&s;tinction is made.</P>
<P>THE reader may then &s;ay, that there will be this temptation to pride among the &s;aints in heaven, to all eternity: For there will be in heaven, great and everla&s;ting di&s;tinctions of free grace. But this objection will vani&s;h in a moment, when you con&s;ider that all fuel for pride to kindle, will be forever taken away in that world; as no corruption at all will be admitted there; no moral capacity of pride.</P>
<P>YOU will then &s;ay, that from this view of things, eminent advances in grace and favor in this life are &s;trong incentives of pride, in the mo&s;t exalted &s;aints on earth. They are &s;o. They always were, and always will be, &s;o long as any moral depravity remains, or any principle of pride in their hearts. Paul found it &s;o when God, of his free grace, &s;et
<PB N="155" REF="030609_0154_0FE82DDA944506A0">
him at a great di&s;tance from others, by &s;pe|cial di&s;coveries and divine raptures. 2 Cor. xii. Saints in heaven, will find the &s;ame thing operating in a way of the deepe&s;t hu|mility, which now takes hold of their cor|rupt part, as an incentive to pride and &s;elf exaltation. On earth, &s;piritual pride hath always been a very dangerous and trouble|&s;ome enemy to the comfort of eminent &s;aints, indeed to all good people.</P>
<P>IF you enquire, how did holy angels find pride originating or moving in them&punc; I an|&s;wer; this is a que&s;tion that never was &s;ol|ved, nor ever can be, <HI>by man.</HI> It is a fact; but wholly incomprehen&s;ible by us, as in|numerable other facts are. This, however, may be &s;aid, &s;aints in heaven are &s;ecured by Chri&s;t; the fallen angels were not.</P>
<P>IN a word, the mo&s;t exalted &s;aints in hea|ven, will be as much before others in hu|mility, as in any other part of their holy attainments; and will bow as much lower before the throne of God, as they are exalted higher. Thus I am advocating the only rational, go&s;pel doctrine, that will exclude all boa&s;ting. In heaven, it will be confirm|ed, when they will view the matter of their ju&s;tification, the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, "to all and upon all, without any difference."</P>
<P>THIS go&s;pel doctrine tends greatly to the promotion of practical holine&s;s and virtue.</P>
<P>THE bands of love and gratitude ever were, and ever will be, the proper bands of a man. Fear and terror, never yet had any
<PB N="156" REF="030609_0155_0FE82DDF2703F210">
direct tendency to holine&s;s and a good life. I mean common, legal fear. For it always carries in it, not only terror, but even odium of its object. It never attracts the &s;oul to the object of terror, but quite the rever&s;e. Love, or a &s;en&s;e of goodne&s;s, amiablene&s;s, kindne&s;s, or benevolence, always attracts and affimilates the &s;oul to its object. As God hath con&s;tituted immortal &s;ouls and their objects, it cannot be otherwi&s;e. This is not only the clear doctrine of rea&s;on and &s;cripture; but al&s;o the doctrine of all called orthodox, &s;ince the days of the apo&s;tles; remarkably &s;o, &s;ince the reformation from popery.</P>
<P>IT is true, papi&s;ts and arminians have of|ten told us that the doctrine tends to licen|tiou&s;ne&s;s; and that, if they believed the in|finite &s;tedfa&s;t, immutable love of God, and faithfulne&s;s of Chri&s;t, as we do, in re&s;pect to our &s;alvation, the certain per&s;everence of be|lievers and the like, they would indulge them&s;elves in all manner of &s;inful lu&s;ts and plea&s;ures. While their hearts are unrenew|ed, and while they believe not this glorious doctrine, they may think as they &s;ay. But did they believe, and feel the power of it, they would know better, as calvini&s;ts have always told them. They would find the cords of &s;uch love very different bands from what they imagine, while in ignorance of God and the power of his love.</P>
<P>WHAT great things has &s;lavi&s;h fear or ter|ror ever done to make men holy? It will keep them from many open and daring
<PB N="157" REF="030609_0156_0FE82DE27B1974A0">
crimes, in the &s;ight of man, it is true: But at the &s;ame time they will be ju&s;t as guilty in the &s;ight of God, as if they had no &s;uch fear. In their very &s;ouls, they will wi&s;h and long to commit them, as much as ever. In this wi&s;h, and longing de&s;ire of the &s;oul, lies all the &s;in, in the &s;ight of God.</P>
<P>PRINCIPLES of fear are managed to good advantage, by the laws and government of men. And without taking this great and good advantage of a principle of &s;lavi&s;h, un|&s;anctified fear, in man, we could not live in human &s;ociety. But the vile, hardened wretch, who is re&s;trained in his overt actions, only by fear of the whip and the gallows, is as greatly guilty in the &s;ight of God, as if the&s;e fearful re&s;traints had never been upon him. The civil magi&s;trate has much to do with this principle of fear in man. All human laws make great u&s;e of it; and this is wi&s;e, and good for the end propo&s;ed. But alas! how little doth this avail as to things invi&s;ible and eternal? How little with the habituated drunkard? How little with the inveterate thief and robber? Take away the fear of vi&s;ible, temporal puni&s;hment, and does it at all appear that the terrors of eter|nal damnation have any influence on their conduct? Although they profe&s;s to believe the doctrine, and allude to it in almo&s;t all their conver&s;ation, their mouths being per|petually full of hell and damnation. Verily it is a &s;en&s;e of the goodne&s;s of God that leadeth to repentance, a true &s;en&s;e of God, <HI>as love,</HI> that meliorates the heart, with a di|vine
<PB N="158" REF="030609_0157_0FE82DE7F8A62E98">
power on the life and conduct. "If ye love me keep my commandments." "Walk in love." "The love of Chri&s;t con|&s;traineth us."</P>
<P>I NEVER yet heard any man pray or preach to any congregation, without build|ing on principles, which, by ju&s;t, inevitable con&s;equence, would infer the &s;ure &s;alvation of all the human kind, <HI>at la&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>WE all agree in the&s;e particulars. We pray for the &s;alvation of all. We, in the name of Chri&s;t, offer &s;alvation to all on the pur|cha&s;e of his blood. In the name of Chri&s;t, we command all to believe. We tell all men that they have a good warrant to be|lieve: That a &s;ufficient foundation is laid for them all to believe; and that if they do believe they &s;hall certainly be &s;aved; and that not at all on the merit of their faith, but the merit of Chri&s;t: That their repent|ance and faith and whatever good may be in them, does not in the lea&s;t alter the foundation, or object of their faith. We tell them that it is the greate&s;t &s;in <HI>not to be|lieve</HI>; that it maketh God a liar, as far as they are able. In the name of Chri&s;t, we promi&s;e them full pardon and life eternal, when they repent, and believe, and obey the go&s;pel; and this, not in the lea&s;t, <HI>for</HI> their repentance, faith, and obedience. What then, do we make of all the&s;e graces <HI>in man,</HI> but only means leading to the enjoyment of an end, not dependent on <HI>the&s;e means,</HI> but <HI>they</HI> dependent on <HI>that</HI>: Not an end which
<PB N="159" REF="030609_0158_0FE82DEA78B4B940">
the&s;e means do e&s;tabli&s;h; but e&s;tabli&s;hed be|forehand, as an immutable foundation, on which alone is built the propriety, u&s;e and nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>all the&s;e means</HI>?</P>
<P>I HAVE often heard much incon&s;i&s;tency, and contradiction in the prayers and preach|ing of good men; but never heard one per|forming the&s;e duties, who did not adopt many &s;entiments, which, by ju&s;t con&s;e|quence, would infer the &s;alvation of all man|kind, made previou&s;ly &s;ure in the purpo&s;e of God, and the foundation he hath laid in Zion. This is con&s;i&s;tent. Otherwi&s;e, the &s;alvation of man is dependent on <HI>him|&s;elf,</HI> if any thing can be <HI>on a creature.</HI> He depends on his qualifications and exerci&s;es of mind, as the foundation of all his hope. What God hath done is ju&s;t nothing, or wor&s;e than nothing to him, without the&s;e di&s;tinctions <HI>in him&s;elf,</HI> or before he hath them. All God hath done gives him no &s;ecurity. As if one &s;hould &s;ay, that the will and te&s;tament of his father was not his &s;e|curity for the legacy; but his opening and reading of the will, after his father's death, was the only thing that &s;ecured him. Would you not tell &s;uch an one that he did not &s;peak with propriety; that his whole &s;ecurity was in the will and te&s;tament of his father; and that his opening and read|ing it only gave him knowledge of it and comfort in it.</P>
<P>WE u&s;ually pray to God, ju&s;t as Paul directed, and on the &s;ame ground which he has e&s;tabli&s;hed. We pray for the &s;alvation
<PB N="160" REF="030609_0159_0FE82DEF13281550">
of all men. This we ought not to do with|out a foundation in the word of God. If God has decided the point in his word, that many &s;hall be damned eternally, in their own per&s;ons, we have no warrant to pray as we do. But the apo&s;tle bids us pray for the &s;alvation of all men, even &s;uch wicked kings and magi&s;trates as Nero, and the bloody, per&s;ecuting magi&s;trates in tho&s;e days, for all the cruel per&s;ecutors of the church, and for every body el&s;e, without a &s;ingle exception; and then gives this as our war|rant, "God will have all men to be &s;aved and to come unto the knowledge of the truth." He al&s;o enjoins it upon us to give thanks for all men, on the &s;ame ground; becau&s;e "Chri&s;t gave him&s;elf a ran&s;om for all." At the &s;ame time, he plainly intimates, that the time was not then come to pour in all the light that God had de&s;igned in after ages; that a progre&s;&s;ion of light would continue as it had begun, and proceeded thus far; and that the glorious doctrine would be more fully manife&s;t in due time. Read 1. Tim. ii. 1,&mdash;6.</P>

<P>IF it is certain, that the word of God; his ju&s;tice and his glory, do a&s;certain the eter|nal <HI>per&s;onal</HI> damnation of many; we ought to pray for that awful event, as explicitly as for any thing el&s;e. "<HI>Thy will be done,</HI>" ought to run through all our prayers. But how would it &s;trike the minds of any con|gregation in the world, to hear him that leads in prayer, crying mightily to God, that many, or mo&s;t of his fellow men, might be the mi&s;erable victims of his eternal ven|geance <HI>per&s;onally,</HI> in hell to all eternity. Many men di&s;cern premi&s;es well, but do not &s;ee the ju&s;t con&s;equence. We have al|ways &s;een it a clear go&s;pel duty, founded on go&s;pel warrant, to pray for the &s;alvation&punc; of all men, and give thanks for all men, on the foundation laid in Chri&s;t. If a great many have not di&s;cerned the con&s;equence of &s;uch premi&s;es, it is no more than what happens in many other ca&s;es every day.</P>

Having had the &s;pecial
<PB N="162" REF="030609_0161_0FE82DF70AE96560">
care of &s;ouls, many years, and been happy in my charge, I have often conver&s;ed with per&s;ons under &s;pecial awakenings, and great concern about their &s;ouls. I have always kept up the holy law in their view, with all its infinite purity and &s;trictne&s;s, and tremen|dous terrors to the enemies of God; have always told the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed that they could <HI>in no wi&s;e</HI> help them&s;elves, or make any di&s;|tinction in them&s;elves; charged them to make no dependence on their prayers, tears, reformations, or any thing they feel within them&s;elves, but on the &s;overeign grace of God, through the atonement of his Son, totally exclu&s;ive of every thing el&s;e in the univer&s;e; always pointing them to Chri&s;t as the end of the law, in the &s;tead of &s;inners.</P>
<P>I HAVE found numbers that have been by the Spirit of God, brought to this &s;en&s;e of the way of &s;alvation, and have re&s;ted in it as a &s;afe way. They have found it attended with evangelical repentance and great com|fort. And hence have invited the vile&s;t of &s;inners to come to Chri&s;t, and tru&s;t in him, without one moment's delay; telling them there was enough in Chri&s;t for their &s;alva|tion, <HI>vile as they now are:</HI> that the atonement was &s;ufficient to recommend them to God <HI>in their very wor&s;t condition of &s;oul and life</HI>; and that they never could obtain any qualifica|tion, within or without, that would move the heart of God towards them; but that all things on God's part, are ready.</P>
<P>THEY have told me, that they never found them&s;elves &s;o unqualified, as when their
<PB N="163" REF="030609_0162_0FE82DF892F702D0">
relief and comfort broke in upon them in a way of <HI>mere faith</HI>; and that they looked far from them&s;elves, even as far as <HI>Mount Calvary,</HI> for all their hope; and that they &s;aw all God had done to relieve their di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed &s;ouls, was done, &s;ure and certain, long before they were born. And that they could make no foundation of hope in all that God had wrought on their &s;ouls, but prai&s;e his glorious name that he has been plea&s;ed, in mere, &s;overeign mercy, to work thus effectu|ally on them, only in order to lead them to the &s;en&s;e and comfort of what was immu|table truth before, viz. The all-&s;ufficiency of Chri&s;t for the chief of &s;inners. The&s;e per&s;ons have generally brought forth fruits meet for repentance, and walked as real chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>THE ob&s;ervation of my fathers and bre|thren in the go&s;pel mini&s;try, as many of them have told me, is the very &s;ame in their concerns with &s;ouls, with what I have now mentioned. They have al&s;o told me, it is their true experience with re&s;pect to their own &s;ouls, and all their comfort; and I am certain it is mine. It is well known that all pious prote&s;tant mini&s;ters have taken this very method in guiding &s;ouls to Chri&s;t. And all the &s;ucce&s;s they have found, has been by thus cutting off &s;inners every way, as much as po&s;&s;ible, from every dependence, but on Chri&s;t alone. God has granted his peculiar ble&s;&s;ing on this doctrine, and this way of guiding poor, mi&s;erable &s;inners to a Savior. No mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel in this
<PB N="164" REF="030609_0163_0FE82D67A4D64088">
land was ever more ble&s;&s;ed of God in his labors, perhaps, than the renowned bi&s;hop <HI>Stoddard,</HI> of Northampton. Every one that is acquainted with his character and wri|tings mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible that this was his method.</P>
<P>MANY, no doubt, were brought to know Chri&s;t, in that remarkable period, in the year 1740, and a few &s;ucceeding years, not|with&s;tanding the great frailty and di&s;traction of human nature appeared much in tho&s;e days. All, &s;o far as I can learn, who be|came true followers of Chri&s;t, in tho&s;e times, built firmly on this very doctrine; that Chri&s;t alone is the compleat Savior of the chief of &s;inners, exclu&s;ive of every di&s;tinction in them&s;elves, previou&s;ly moving the heart of God towards them, or, in any wi&s;e, &s;itting them for mercy; that all that maketh them to differ from the mo&s;t abandoned of the human race, flows wholly from a previous &s;ource, alike open to all, and built on a foundation as independent of man, as God was in creating him at fir&s;t. It is well known that the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful preachers in tho&s;e days, dwelt mainly on the&s;e very doc|trines.</P>
<P>THIS doctrine of &s;aving, UNIVERSAL grace, <HI>is perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with the mo&s;t plain and po&s;itive declarations of the word of God, that the pains of hell &s;hall be endle&s;s; and that the wicked &s;hall go away into everla&s;ting puni&s;h|ment, in all the boundle&s;s extent of the&s;e words, and many others that convey the &s;ame idea of the
<PB N="165" REF="030609_0164_0FE82E0005FBA978">
endle&s;s puni&s;hment of &s;inners, and that in the plaine&s;t po&s;&s;ible manner of expre&s;&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>IN their <HI>Surety, Vicar,</HI> or <HI>Sub&s;titute,</HI> i. e. in Chri&s;t, "<HI>the head of every man,</HI>" they go away into <HI>everla&s;ting puni&s;hment,</HI> in a true go&s;pel &s;en&s;e. In him they &s;uffer infinite puni&s;h|ment. i. e. he &s;uffers for them, in their room and &s;tead. But how &s;o? The divine nature never &s;uffered, and the human nature was not infinite, nor capable of infinite &s;uffer|ings; yet by union in per&s;on with infinite Deity, the go&s;pel, the divine con&s;titution does account the atonement infinite. The obeying, and the &s;uffering human nature was as much united to all the attributes of Deity, as to any one of them; to Deity in all his infinite perfections; to the eter|nity of Deity as much as to his omni&s;cience, almightine&s;s, or any other attribute. And the &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t are eternal &s;ufferings, ju&s;t in the &s;ame way of rea&s;oning that they are infinite. The &s;ame ineffable, hypo&s;tatic union of human and divine natures, which connects infinity with manhood in one per|&s;on, does equally unite eternity with the &s;ame. There is the &s;ame go&s;pel propriety in calling them eternal &s;ufferings, as infinite &s;ufferings. It is only by per&s;onal union with Deity, that either term will bear.</P>
<P>THE apo&s;tle gives us this idea, as plainly as any other, to lead us to e&s;timate the atone|ment complete for the &s;ins of the world, and in the go&s;pel account&punc; an eternal pun|i&s;hment. He con&s;iders the gift of &s;alvation by Chri&s;t, under the idea of a will or te&s;ta|ment,
<PB N="166" REF="030609_0165_0FE82D692CA18D68">
that makes the legacy &s;ure; as &s;ure before the legatee knows any thing about it, or has any comfort in it, as afterwards. And, as in all his writings, he exhibits the atonement complete in every other view, &s;o he does in the eternity of it, in the divine account; that none may imagine him&s;elf to be expo&s;ed to per&s;onal puni&s;hment in hell to all eternity, for want of an eternal atone|ment, any more than for want of an infinite one. He tells us that a &s;en&s;e of this, will free the con&s;cience from every bond that might hold the poor &s;inner under obligation to &s;uffer; and will al&s;o become a &s;pring of holy gratitude and living &s;acrifice to God. "How much more &s;hall the blood of Chri&s;t, who, <HI>through the eternal Spirit,</HI> offered him|&s;elf without &s;pot to God, purge your con|&s;cience from dead works to &s;erve the living God?" Heb. ix. No per&s;on of judgment will &s;ay that the phra&s;e, <HI>through the eternal Spirit,</HI> here &s;ignifies, that the eternal Spirit of God &s;upported Chri&s;t in his &s;ufferings: For he was then wholly for&s;aken in this &s;en&s;e, and left, in his expiring moments, without any &s;upport at all, as much as ever a victim was, when bound and bleeding on the altar. It was then he cried out, "My God, my God, why ha&s;t thou for&s;aken me!"</P>
<P>WE cannot make the atonement &s;ufficient for our redemption in any &s;en&s;e; unle&s;s we con&s;ider the human nature infinitely digni|fied, by per&s;onal union with Deity, with every attribute of Deity, one as much as another. On this very ground it is, that
<PB N="167" REF="030609_0166_0FE82E018DD703B8">
the merit of the atonement took place, and was efficacious long before Chri&s;t came in the fle&s;h. Yea, from eternity, it was effica|cious, on our behalf, in the mind and decree of God. And it was, from eternity, regarded in the gracious purpo&s;e of the Mo&s;t High; as he always determined to &s;ave &s;inners in this way and no other. "Then was I by him, as one brought up with him; and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always be|fore him; rejoicing in the habitable parts of the earth, and my delights were with the &s;ons of men." Prov. viii.</P>
<P>THE atonement of the Lamb of God, which taketh away the &s;in of the world, was pre&s;ent in God's view from all eternity; and will be &s;o to all eternity, as much as when he was actually bleeding on the cro&s;s, in all his amazing agonies. Thus he is "the Lamb &s;lain from the foundation of the world." Or, if you put the adjective before the &s;ub&s;tantive, as a late writer does, and as it &s;tands in the original, the idea is the &s;ame; "the &s;lain Lamb from the foundation of the world."</P>
<P>THUS, at the great and &s;olemn day, cha|racters &s;hall be &s;eparated one from another, as a &s;hepherd divideth the &s;heep from the goats. God will &s;hew infinite approbation to the <HI>character</HI> of his own Son, the Son of man, as foederal head in union with his re|deemed creatures, placing it at his right hand; a phra&s;e denoting approbation and honor. And he will manife&s;t infinite wrath, indignation and vengeance again&s;t the real
<PB N="168" REF="030609_0167_0FE82E0814CAEFE0">
character of man, placing it at his left hand; which denotes the utmo&s;t dete&s;tation and abhorrence. The place of his Son will, on that day, be at his right hand, as it always was, and always will be, and "where I am," &s;ays Je&s;us, "there &s;hall my &s;ervants be." The character of &s;inners the real character of all men &s;ince the fall, was always at God's left hand, and always will be God never abhorred man as his creature, never hated, and never will hate any thing in man, but his bad character. In Chri&s;t, he has no bad character, but one infinitely good. And God will bid all that &s;u&s;tain it, wel|come to all the joys and glories of heaven; even all who&s;e &s;ins the Lamb of God came to take away.</P>
<P>WHEN the great Judge &s;hall give final &s;entence, and thus di&s;play his wondrous love to his elect head, and his elect body of human nature, al&s;o his tremendous abhor|rence of the character of &s;inners, it will make all human nature tremble. But they will <HI>rejoice</HI> with trembling. Their amazing &s;en&s;e of the holy indignation of God again&s;t &s;in, will not allay their holy joy, which will be in God alone, on that day, and to all eternity. They will &s;ee their per&s;onal de&s;erts in the <HI>eternal &s;ufferings</HI> of their Head: For in go&s;pel account they are &s;o; though in time endured once for all on the cro&s;s. They will, I &s;ay, then, and forever-more, &s;ee their damnable character and de&s;erts in them&s;elves; and will go away into everla&s;t|ing puni&s;hment, in this &s;en&s;e. This is the

true, and only &s;en&s;e of the go&s;pel con&s;titu|tion; which is well called a wonderful my&s;|tery, claiming the admiration and a&s;toni&s;h|ment of angels and &s;aints, now and forever.</P>
<P>TO behold the redeemed &s;urrounded with the mo&s;t formidable di&s;plays of the wrath of God forever, again&s;t their real per&s;onal character <HI>while in this world,</HI> and with his aw|ful indignation forever, as a burning flame, a|gain&s;t all ungodline&s;s and unrighteou&s;ne&s;s of men; and to behold the very per&s;ons to whom this real character did per&s;onally per|tain, made perfectly innocent in a &s;ub&s;ti|tuted character, their robes all wa&s;hed and made white in the blood of the Lamb, with clean hands and a pure heart, dwelling in this devouring fire, and inhabiting the&s;e everla&s;ting burnings, in di&s;plays of righteous and holy Deity; and yet perfectly ble&s;&s;ed, and even the more ble&s;&s;ed, for this their &s;it|uation; in the mid&s;t of all the&s;e awful di&s;|plays, dwelling on high, and having their place of defence the munition of rocks, bread given them and their waters &s;ure: This is indeed a wonder of love worthy of the wi&s;|dom of God only wi&s;e.

<P>ALL this glory and terror of divine holi|ne&s;s and ju&s;tice, we &s;ee, and forever &s;hall &s;ee, in the &s;ufferings of the Son of God for &s;inners. And there is no more need of the eternal <HI>per&s;onal</HI> damnation of any of the human race further to di&s;play and illu&s;|trate the glory of God's ju&s;tice, and his in|finite holy anger again&s;t &s;in; than there is
<PB N="170" REF="030609_0169_0FE82E10F8B32EB8">
need of the dim light of a candle, to help us to behold the beautiful face of the earth in the vernal &s;ea&s;on, when the &s;un &s;hines in the meridian, with all his glorious &s;plendor and in his full &s;trength. Even to &s;uppo&s;e otherwi&s;e, is in full oppo&s;ition to the &s;ole glory of God and Chri&s;t in the atonement. The go&s;pel is, with great propriety, called a "mini&s;tration of righteou&s;ne&s;s." i. e. right|eou&s;ne&s;s di&s;played, imparted, and applied, even as the mini&s;tration of healing medi|cines, imparted and applied for the recovery of the &s;ick.</P>
<P>IT is, moreover, evidential of the truth of this doctrine of free &s;overeign grace, as now illu&s;trated, that <HI>there is no po&s;&s;ible danger in believing, and living according to the genuine dictates of it.</HI></P>
<P>IT will certainly have the &s;ame influence on the heart and life, which the common prote&s;tant doctrine of grace always had; but only much more powerful in its ble&s;&s;ed operations and effects. It is the &s;elf &s;ame doctrine, in all points but this: It extends the &s;ame eternal good will of God to all poor &s;inners of mankind; which we have been taught, by puritan divines, is confined only to a part; and it may be to a very &s;mall part indeed, agreeably to the more natural a&s;pect of their doctrine. It differs no more from the doctrine of <HI>Calvin, Owen,</HI> and <HI>Ed|wards,</HI> and the great body of prote&s;tants, than a circle as large as the the periphery of the earth, differs from a circle of the diam|eter
<PB N="171" REF="030609_0170_0FE82E1286FFAFE0">
of one cubit. Both have all the &s;ame properties, and every demon&s;tration may be built on the one, that may on the other; but only one is much larger than the other.</P>
<P>IN this ca&s;e, we hold the great di&s;tingui&s;h|ing doctrines of divine revelation exactly as they have always been taught, by tho&s;e cal|led orthodox. Particularly; the fir&s;t Adam a federal, as well as natural head, for all human nature: Our fall, guilt and mi&s;ery in and by him: The kind decrees, and im|mutable purpo&s;es of the Mo&s;t High to &s;ave &s;inners: The covenant of redemption with the &s;econd federal head, even Chri&s;t, the &s;e|cond man, the Lord from heaven: The all &s;ufficiency of his atonement, and his obedi|ence unto death, in the room and &s;tead of &s;inners: The nece&s;&s;ity of regeneration by the almighty power, and free grace of God: The nece&s;&s;ity of repentance, faith, and &s;anc|tification, a holy mind, per&s;everance to the end, all through Chri&s;t, and by the power of his &s;pirit and grace. Yet, we think the doctrines of divine love, redeeming love and grace, include a greater number of poor, wretched &s;inners, all alike unworthy of mer|cy; than good people have, in time pa&s;t imagined. This is the only point of differ|ence.</P>
<P>I BELIEVE, God will have all men to be &s;aved: That the Lamb of God hath taken away the &s;in of the world: Died for the &s;ins of the whole world: That as &s;in hath reign|ed unto death, much more &s;hall grace reign through righteou&s;ne&s;s to eternal life, by Je|&s;us
<PB N="172" REF="030609_0171_0FE82E180A7E2070">
Chri&s;t our Lord. I believe all this, in the common, plain, natural &s;en&s;e of lan|guage; and &s;o I do a thou&s;and other plain a&s;&s;ertions in the bible as full and direct to the &s;ame purpo&s;e as the&s;e are. Yet, I have every motive, even with additional force, to &s;eek the kingdom of God and his righteou&s;|ne&s;s; to pre&s;s into the kingdom of God; to make my calling and election &s;ure; that ever was yet urged from the word of God: And &s;o has every man in the world.</P>
<P>WE in&s;i&s;t on the &s;ame qualifications and <HI>in the &s;ame way;</HI> as do they who are called or|thodox. We know that while we believe not with an holy heart, we &s;hall be damned. We know that except we are born again, we cannot &s;ee the kingdom of God, are condemned al|ready; and that the wrath of God abideth on us, unle&s;s we are united to Chri&s;t by re|generation and &s;aving faith; and that except we repent we &s;hall all a&s;&s;uredly peri&s;h. We in&s;i&s;t on every medium, every qualification for heaven that ever was in&s;i&s;ted on, by any pure go&s;pel preacher. We have every mo|tive to avoid all the ways of wickedne&s;s, and u&s;e all the means of grace and &s;alvation that ever the renowned <HI>Calvin</HI> had. He be|lieved that all the elect &s;hould infallibly be &s;aved, and no more; &s;o do I. He believed, God hath fixed and e&s;tabli&s;hed the certain number, from all eternity, as immutably as his own being; &s;o do I. And let men cavil as much as they plea&s;e; there is but ju&s;t one way to get rid of this doctrine; and that is to deny divine revelation, and the
<PB N="173" REF="030609_0172_0FE82E1A8FF2AFF8">
nece&s;&s;ary attributes of God. <HI>Calvin</HI> believed that Chri&s;t had undertaken to prepare all the elect for heaven, and would mo&s;t certainly &s;ee the work done, in his own time and way; &s;o do I. He in&s;i&s;ted on the nece&s;&s;ity of the means of grace and &s;alvation, and great propriety of them, and adduced the word of God, and all the rea&s;on and nature of things, to demon&s;trate that as a truth; which he did beyond all rational contra|diction; &s;o do I. His idea of heaven and hell was the &s;elf &s;ame as mine, as to the na|ture of the happine&s;s and mi&s;ery of each. I mention Mr. <HI>Calvin</HI>; becau&s;e his name and character are much known. I might unite with him, the great body of chri&s;tian teach|ers &s;ince his day.</P>
<P>NOW where is the difference between us, in the doctrine I plead for? This, indeed gives a greater di&s;play, a more a&s;toni&s;hing manife&s;tation of the goodne&s;s of the great Father of all, than we have before admitted. The eternal, rich, free, &s;overeign love of the immen&s;e eternal &s;ource of love, breaks forth to our view, in more copious, and amazing floods. The triumph of grace is more glorious than heretofore, <HI>in our &s;en&s;e of it</HI>; and gives our &s;ouls a mo&s;t &s;urprizing, adoring, rapturous &s;hock, enough to make us break forth, "O the depth of the riches, both of the wi&s;dom and knowledge of God! how un&s;earchable are his determinations, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> and his ways pa&s;t finding out!" "For of him,
<PB N="174" REF="030609_0173_0FE82E20F1417770">
and through him, and to him are all things: to whom be glory forever. Amen."</P>
<P>EVERY judicious reader will &s;ee, that the u&s;e of means cannot alter the ca&s;e as to the &s;alvation of the elect, any more on the com|mon doctrine of prede&s;tination, than on this I plead for; yet there is the greate&s;t propri|ety in the u&s;e of appointed means. On both principles, the means and the end are in&s;eparably connected, in the eternal gra|cious purpo&s;e of God.</P>
<P>UNTHINKING, unrea&s;onable men have al|ways been wont to tell tho&s;e who were founded on the pure doctrines of free, &s;ove|reign grace, and who tru&s;ted all to God and nothing to them&s;elves&punc; and were thence led into pure and holy lives, lives of prayer, &s;elf denial, watchfulne&s;s, dying to the world, and all the vanities and carnal delights of it; that if they them&s;elves had &s;uch a belief of God's character, decrees and dealings with men, they would plunge into all manner of &s;inful plea&s;ures, and would gratify every lu&s;t, in the highe&s;t degree. However, they who have indeed received this grace of God, have con&s;tantly affirmed that the greater &s;en&s;e they had of the infinite, eternal, immu|table love of God to them, the more they loved him and all his holy laws: And the greater a&s;&s;urance they had that Chri&s;t died for them, the more they hated and abhorred all their &s;infulne&s;s of nature and life, which nailed &s;o dear a Savior to the cro&s;s: The more they realized their ab&s;olute &s;afety in God alone, and the certainty of their per&s;e|verance
<PB N="175" REF="030609_0174_0FE82E2278DCCB10">
to the end, through the promi&s;es grace, and faithfulne&s;s of Chri&s;t, the more they felt their hearts weaned from the world: The more Spiritual and heavenly was the frame and temper of their minds, as they &s;aw more of the vanity of them&s;elves and of all creatures, and that God was all in all.</P>
<P>THE children of God have always &s;poken the truth in all this. And we can &s;ay the &s;ame, in an&s;wer to the &s;ame cavils of a blind world at enmity with God, and igno|rant of his nature, which is love. Only we may add, that as we have more exten&s;ive views of the love of God, and the glorious harmony of all his attributes, in gathering together in one all things in Chri&s;t; &s;o, we tru&s;t, it has a more powerful influence on our &s;ouls, of the &s;ame kind.</P>
<P>IF we really mi&s;take concerning the ex|tent of the merits, and &s;alvation of the Savior of all men; it is at the farthe&s;t remove from a mi&s;take, that affects the e&s;&s;entials of reli|gion. It is only a wrong conjecture as to the number whom Chri&s;t will &s;ave, in one and the &s;ame way. There always have been dif|ferent opinions among good people in this article. Some have been far more charita|ble than others, on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>SOME, at this day, expect a millennium of three hundred and &s;ixty five thou&s;and years, i. e. a thou&s;and prophetic years; in which long period almo&s;t all on earth &s;hall be ho|ly and happy. I was ever in this &s;entiment; and am full in it now. Yet many good peo|ple,
<PB N="176" REF="030609_0175_0FE82E27F1ADA6C0">
at the pre&s;ent day and for ages pa&s;t, have &s;aid that they could find nothing in the word of God, but that the day of judgment might be in their day; having no expecta|tion at all of &s;uch a latter-day glory. Now, there is an almo&s;t infinite difference between the belief of the&s;e two, as to the extent of &s;alvation; yet both are in the &s;ame &s;ure way to heaven, and on the &s;ame e&s;&s;ential foundation. There is a much greater differ|ence between tho&s;e that have faith in a mil|lennium, and tho&s;e who have not, as to the number that &s;hall be &s;aved; than there is between the advocates for the &s;alvation of all men, and the former; at lead as to tho&s;e that have already lived on the earth.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE you hear three pious chri&s;tians di&s;cour&s;ing on the doctrines of grace, and the way of &s;alvation; all in perfect agree|ment. At the clo&s;e of the conver&s;ation, each gives his opinion with regard to the number, to be &s;aved. One &s;ays, the way appears to him &s;o exceeding &s;trait, that he believes not more than one hundred thou|&s;and of all the human race, will ever get to heaven. Another &s;ays, he believes there will be more than one hundred thou&s;and &s;aved, but he is confident not a million. The third, having great faith in a millenni|um, and naturally &s;omewhat unhappy in his talent at computation, is per&s;uaded that there will be more of the human race &s;aved, than there are &s;ingle atoms of matter in this whole globe of earth. You would not im|agine that either was in an error, in any
<PB N="177" REF="030609_0176_0FE82E2A5B077EA0">
thing that concerned his own &s;alvation. From a good acquaintance with human na|ture, you would only infer, that the fir&s;t was naturally a man of a narrow &s;oul and &s;tingy temper of mind; that the &s;econd was, in the&s;e re&s;pects, not &s;o unhappy; and that the la&s;t was rather inattentive in his computations; but that they might be all in the &s;ame way to heaven. And, indeed, if a great &s;en&s;e of the <HI>free,</HI> &s;overeign grace of God, leads men into vice and immorality, <HI>how comes it to pa&s;s,</HI> as always appears to be fact, <HI>that they who have the highe&s;t &s;en&s;e of this, have ever been men of the pure&s;t lives?</HI></P>
<P>IF I under&s;tand the go&s;pel to be glad tidings of great joy, which &s;hall be to all people, in the common natural &s;en&s;e of lan|guage; and another under&s;tands the &s;ame words to mean glad tidings to a few people of all &s;orts, and very &s;ad tidings to the bulk of mankind, as being a &s;ure occa&s;ion of en|hancing their eternal mi&s;ery in an awful degree: Yet, if I have go&s;pel qualifications to reli&s;h and enjoy heaven, I &s;hall go there; and &s;o will he in the &s;ame way. For we both agree in the nece&s;&s;ity of the &s;ame work on our &s;ouls, without which there is no &s;al|vation for any. I in&s;i&s;t on the&s;e qualifi|cations, as flowing from a previous all-&s;ufficient atonement made for all &s;inners of the human race, and as nece&s;&s;ary to give me &s;en&s;e and enjoyment of the benefit of that atonement, to which Chri&s;t has given me a previous title.

to make out his title for him, in&s;tead of taking it &s;olely from Chri&s;t, and as &s;ealed in his blood alone. I believe that, while we were yet enemies, Chri&s;t died for the ungodly, and &s;ecured them for life eternal, as a Prie&s;t; and then goes on, as a Prophet and King, to enlighten and &s;ubdue them, and make them know the things freely given them of God. I put the atonement at the bottom, the death of Chri&s;t as the chief corner &s;tone, and build all upon that. He &s;uppo&s;es the &s;acrifice of Chri&s;t not to be the foundation of all our hope; but when we have got good previous qualifications, then we may make great advantage of it, and bring it in &s;omewhere in the building, though not at the bottom of all, Chri&s;t the <HI>only foundation.</HI> Both of us agree in this, that the greater &s;en&s;e and experience of God's free grace we have, the more we &s;hall love and &s;erve God; and that the love of God, or God in his character, which is LOVE, is the only principle that con&s;traineth us to love God, and live an holy life, or that the goodne&s;s of God leadeth to repentance.</P>
<P>THE general a&s;pect of the <HI>limitarian prin|ciples,</HI> is, that a very few, in compari&s;on with the whole of mankind, &s;hall ever be &s;aved; and, indeed, that but a very &s;mall part, even of tho&s;e people that enjoy divine revelation, will e&s;cape eternal, per&s;onal damnation; and a far le&s;s number, in pro|portion, among all heathen nations. On this principle, the go&s;pel is by no means

glad tidings of great joy which &s;hall be unto <HI>all people,</HI> in any common, natural &s;en&s;e of language: But to people and nations, as &s;uch, it is very <HI>bad news, doleful tidings</HI> to any nation or people, in a collective view, as they are plainly addre&s;&s;ed in the text, to which I allude.</P>
<P>TAKE, for example, the inhabitants of the United States, as a people.

How then are the tidings glad tidings to the people, as &s;uch? They are plainly declared as &s;uch every where in the voice of the go&s;pel. Yet upon this plan, the people will be far more mi&s;erable than if they had never heard the go&s;pel. Suppo&s;e one out of an hundred is &s;aved, which is as many as the general a&s;pect of the <HI>limitarian</HI> doctrine will admit; or, if you plea&s;e, &s;uppo&s;e ten among a hundred, which is going quite beyond the charity of the doctrine: You mu&s;t &s;till allow that all the re&s;t are ten thou&s;and times more mi&s;e|rable, and will be &s;o to all eternity, than if they had never heard the go&s;pel.

the go&s;pel becomes glad tidings only to a very few individuals; but dreadful tidings to any people, or all people, as &s;uch.</P>
<P>A SOVEREIGN prince has a colony con|&s;i&s;ting of one million &s;ubjects. All much on a level, laboring under the toils and burdens which attend a people, that eat their bread in the &s;weat of their face, &s;trug|gling hard for a comfortable provi&s;ion for them&s;elves and families. The common lot in this evil world. The king &s;ends an her|ald to a&s;&s;emble them all together, and to addre&s;s them in the following words:</P>
<P>"BEHOLD I bring you glad tidings of great joy, which &s;hall be to all this people. For it is the immutable decree of your &s;ove|reign, that a few of you &s;hall be delivered from all your toils and labors, and &s;hall be exceedingly rich and happy all their days, abounding in every po&s;&s;ible plea&s;ure and delight. And that all the re&s;t of you &s;hall be inexpre&s;&s;ibly more mi&s;erable and di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed all their days, than ever they have been. Their labors, toils and vexation &s;hall be increa&s;ed more than a thou&s;and fold. Your &s;overeign will mark the happy few with a di&s;tinction, which his own hand and no other can &s;et upon them; and the mul|titude, not &s;o marked, &s;hall forever find their woes amazingly augmented."</P>
<P>WOULD not the colony, the people, be filled with horror at the tidings, and think the news exceedingly &s;orrowful? Would it not be much happier for that colony, as a people, to live as they did before;
<PB N="181" REF="030609_0180_0FE82E3256F40D88">
though many toils and troubles attended them?</P>
<P>NOW, &s;hould, the herald proceed to name the happy few, perhaps one in a thou&s;and; and the multitude of their brethren &s;hould &s;ee them rejoicing and triumphing in the &s;overeign di&s;tinction, by the free grace of their prince; would they not &s;ay that this very joy and triumph was all founded in pride and &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, and a total want of benevolence to the community? And &s;hould tho&s;e favorites cry out glad tidings! glad tidings! would not the wailing multitude an&s;wer, "<HI>To you glad tidings they may be; but not to the people. The colony is ruined; the people are undone, undone forever!</HI>" Andif the&s;e <HI>few favorites</HI> of their &s;overeign had that amiable &s;pirit of benevolence, which adorns human nature, and is one of the glories of the go&s;pel, would they not rather chu&s;e to return to a level with their brethren, and partake with them in common, in all troubles and calamities as before, than to be thus &s;ingled out for dignity, glory, and plea&s;ure, when nece&s;&s;arily connected with &s;uch augmented woe and mi&s;ery to the people?</P>
<P>THE ca&s;e now &s;tated, applies to the go&s;pel tidings, on the <HI>limitarian</HI> plan. A few, very few that hear them, are made happy. All the re&s;t are much more dreadfully mi&s;erable on account of Chri&s;t and the go&s;pel.

<P><PB N="182" REF="030609_0181_0FE82E38F6C52228">I HOLD to the doctrine of prede&s;tination as fully as any man in the world ever did, and that in the &s;upra-lap&s;arian &s;en&s;e, which is the only con&s;i&s;tent &s;en&s;e. The ab&s;olute &s;overeignty of JEHOVAH I maintain in the highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible conception of it. But, it will abundantly appear, in its proper place, that JEHOVAH is not a God who&s;e attributes and &s;overeign will can admit of &s;uch a pre|de&s;tination as that; &s;uch decrees as I have alluded to. God is love, infinite love, &s;ove|reign love; and &s;uch love admits of no &s;uch <HI>limitarian</HI> decrees; and the word of God abhors them, as you &s;hall &s;ee in the &s;equel.</P>
<P>IT is an evidence of the true go&s;pel, that there is no contradiction in it. Every &s;en|timent in it, is in full concord with the whole.</P>
<P>A SERMON is not made up of contradic|tory parts, if it be wholly a go&s;pel &s;ermon. Now, the doctrine I plead for, is the only plan that ever was exhibited, as con&s;i&s;tent with it&s;elf. The arminian &s;cheme is full of incon&s;i&s;tencies. See what the late pre&s;ident <HI>Edwards</HI> has made of it; and he has de|mon&s;tration on his &s;ide. Many other great men have oppo&s;ed it with the &s;ame force. The calvini&s;tic &s;cheme, in the <HI>limitarian</HI> &s;en&s;e, is every whit as <HI>full of contradiction</HI> and ab&s;urdity; as hath often been objected, with arguments that admit of no confuta|tion. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of all the re&s;t that ever have been advanced in the world, except this alone. But this has not the
<PB N="183" REF="030609_0182_0FE82D7207C53260">
&s;hadow of incon&s;i&s;tency with it&s;elf. If it be a mere hypothe&s;is, it is a &s;elf-con&s;i&s;tent one.</P>
<P>ON this plan, you may hold up to view the true nature and character of God: That of man in innocency: That of man fallen: The fir&s;t and &s;econd covenant: Give JEHO|VAH his proper place, and man his place: Speak of a work of God on the &s;ouls of &s;in|ners, as nece&s;&s;ary to their &s;alvation: Shew them that without this work they are damned, condemned already, and the wrath of God abideth on them: Tell them what Chri&s;t hath engaged, what he hath done and &s;uf|fered, and for what end; and what he will certainly do: Command all &s;inners to be|lieve it, on pain of abiding damnation: Tell them the warrant and ground of their faith&punc; That they are not commanded to create truth, or in the lea&s;t alter it, by all the changes and exerci&s;es of their own minds; but that eternal, immutable truth is ready to their hands, and, by mere faith, they mu&s;t take hold of it and be &s;aved: That this is the way, in Chri&s;t, &s;ure as Godhead can make it: That Chri&s;t is the way, the truth, and the life, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>AS this doctrine relates to practice, you may urge every moral duty, with infinite force, from motives truly evangelical; hold|ing up the pains of &s;in, and the beauties and rewards of holine&s;s, all in mo&s;t glorious harmony.</P>
<P>THE doctrine we have generally heard from our be&s;t preachers, &s;ince the reforma|tion, hath been of this tenor, viz.
<Q>God
<PB N="184" REF="030609_0183_0FE82D769BC46218">
or hath elected to eternal life a part of man|kind, and Chri&s;t made an atonement for that part only.</Q>
And they have commonly conveyed the idea of a very &s;mall part, in proportion to the whole.
<Q>Which part are elected to the end, and to all the nece&s;&s;ary means and qualifications; which God will infallibly be&s;tow upon them in his own way and time. All the re&s;t of mankind &s;hall as certainly peri&s;h, and that ju&s;tly, the fault being all their own. Now we invite, and command every one to believe in Chri&s;t to &s;alvation, every one alike: For in him there is a fulne&s;s for all.</Q>
A thou&s;and arguments have been advanced to prove there is no incon&s;i&s;tency, no kind of equivocation, or illu&s;ion in this way of preaching; but that it is the pure &s;implicity of the go&s;pel: While it hath always been clear demon&s;tration, on the other hand, that there is great duplicity and illu&s;ion in it. Yet this preaching is exactly right, in every point but this one; <HI>the extent of prede&s;tination.</HI> Only extend it to all the human kind. Only define the decree in the words of the apo&s;tle; <HI>"God will have all men to be &s;aved." "As &s;in hath reigned unto death, &s;o &s;hall grace reign through righteou&s;ne&s;s, unto eternal life, by Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord.</HI>" Many other expre&s;s de|clarations of divine revelation, of the &s;ame import, are as &s;imple and expre&s;s to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, as any language will admit. I &s;ay, thus explain the decrees of God; and all their preaching would be as free from incon|&s;i&s;tency as any mathematical demon&s;tration.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="030609_0184_0FE82E3A81F71CE0">ONLY begin thus, in the plain, &s;imple &s;en&s;e of the words; "<HI>Chri&s;t came that all men through him might be &s;aved.</HI>" Tell peo|ple that this is the eternal fixed prede&s;tina|tion of the Mo&s;t High; and that all means and qualifications are connected with it, in the &s;ame decree, and made as &s;ure as the end, to take place in his own way and time; yet &s;o as to have the free will and actions of his elect, concerned in them, as moral agents and cau&s;es by coun&s;el; which is the only po&s;&s;ible way of connecting the in|termediate &s;teps with the end. Tell your audience &s;o, I &s;ay, and then in all the re&s;t, you may preach law and go&s;pel ju&s;t as <HI>Cal|vin</HI> or <HI>Owen</HI> did, or any other calvini&s;tic divine. Then you may indeed proclaim <HI>Glad tidings of great joy to</HI> ALL PEOPLE; and may urge every go&s;pel doctrine, duty and motive, ju&s;t as we have been wont to hear, without the &s;hadow of contradiction. Then you may call upon all poor, mi&s;era|ble &s;inners as Paul did. He told them all, that Chri&s;t had began his operation in their &s;ouls, as Mediator, and would perfect the whole work unto eternal life; dealing with moral agents <HI>as &s;uch,</HI> in which the will and activity &s;hould have their proper exerci&s;e. "Work out your own &s;alvation with fear and trembling. For it is God who worketh in you, both to will and to do of his good plea&s;ure." On this plan the go&s;pel is plain and clear: And the u&s;ual preaching of it, is con&s;i&s;tent with it&s;elf and with common &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="030609_0185_0FE82E3F1857C7F0">IF any &s;ay here, that the u&s;e of means is of no con&s;ideration, if the end is fixed and certain; they &s;peak in direct oppo&s;ition to this idea of the decrees of God, and the whole &s;cripture account of them, which ever unites the means and end, in one and the &s;ame de|cree; and again&s;t all the common &s;en&s;e and common practice of mankind. Every one that owns the being of God, allows that he <HI>certainly knew</HI> every thing that ever did or &s;hall take place; and that every future event &s;hall certainly be ju&s;t as God always knew it would be. But this never hinders their u&s;ing means, in common life. Nothing can be more certain, than that which God always knew would be, is certain. Whatever di&s;|tinction there is between the foreknowledge and decrees of God; every one &s;ees there can be none in the object, the infallible cer|tainty of the event. Yet there is full room left for all moral agency to operate, with all the liberty that any creature can po&s;&s;ibly be made capable of.</P>
<P>IF any &s;ay, there can be no moral agency at all in creatures; this is a flat contradic|tion to all the common &s;en&s;e and feeling of man.

exi&s;t and exi&s;t at the &s;ame time. So that I have ever imagined that &s;uch a &s;en&s;e|le&s;s cavil is worthy of no notice at all.</P>
<P>BUT to return. The go&s;pel, on the ground I maintain, is all con&s;i&s;tent with it&s;elf, with common &s;en&s;e and rea&s;on, and with univer|&s;al experience, and with the be&s;t rea&s;oning and practice of all mankind in every other matter. We always unite the proper means with the end, in all other ca&s;es; and there is no other way for moral agents to be treat|ed, as &s;uch, and to act in proper character. Creatures are creatures, although God is God.</P>
<P>THERE is a &s;entiment, or impre&s;&s;ion, on the hearts of all men, concerning the dead, that univer&s;ally favors the argument here advanced.</P>
<P>WHEN the vile&s;t &s;inner in the world is taken out of it, by the mo&s;t &s;udden death, we dare not &s;ay, and it would wound our hearts to hear any one &s;ay, "<HI>that per&s;on is certainly gone to an eternal hell, to &s;uffer there in per&s;on forever.</HI>" Who dare &s;ay of the mo&s;t aban|doned &s;ailor, having his head taken off with a cannon ball, with an horrid oath in his mouth, "<HI>I am certain that man &s;hall burn for|ever in hell?</HI>" Yet we might &s;ay &s;o, with great confidence, on the principle I oppo&s;e. Had you, my reader, a &s;on of this character, thus taken out of the world, would you be &s;o deeply affected, in regard to his eternal doom, as if you certainly knew he was in hell? Or had you a &s;on very dear to you,
<PB N="188" REF="030609_0187_0FE82E491AD85C38">
even as Ab&s;alom was to his father, and of a character to the la&s;t moment no better, taken out of the world by the hand of ju&s;|tice; would not the circum&s;tances of his death &s;trike your mind deeper, than any certain knowledge you have of his future &s;tate? You may &s;ay the future &s;tate of men is invi&s;ible, and we have no bu&s;ine&s;s with it. Be it &s;o. Yet, would it be in the power of any man to avoid the mo&s;t dreadful angui&s;h of &s;oul, in &s;uch a ca&s;e but from a <HI>latent hope</HI> in his heart, ari&s;ing from the power and mercy of God?

If we have no bu&s;ine&s;s with the invi&s;ible world in &s;uch a ca&s;e, yet this does not alter the nece&s;&s;ary and unavoidable feelings of human nature.</P>
<P>I AM per&s;uaded that any man, who has buried a dear child, in a ca&s;e which is thought the mo&s;t hopele&s;s of all, will find, if he is critical to ob&s;erve the feelings of his own heart, &s;ome <HI>latent</HI> a&s;&s;uaging of his grief, in thinking of the un&s;earchable riches of Chri&s;t, and the almighty power and infinite mercy of God. Have we not often ob&s;erved much of this nature, in mourning for the dead, even in ca&s;es that would admit of nothing but ab&s;olute de&s;peration, on the <HI>lim|itarian</HI> plan? De&s;pair, in this ca&s;e, never takes place. There is &s;omething in the &s;oul of man that will not admit of it. What
<PB N="189" REF="030609_0188_0FE82E4AA3E2A158">
but the hand of Deity has fixed in the hearts of all mankind this latent hope, in every death?</P>
<P>ALL the pungent pangs of David for the death of Ab&s;alom, may be fully accounted for, on the principles of natural affection, without any con&s;ideration of his future &s;tate. Any tender parent would feel as he did, in the like ca&s;e, without looking into futurity.</P>
<P>IT is exceedingly &s;trange, on the <HI>limitarian</HI> plan, that the &s;criptures have never a&s;&s;erted that any particular per&s;on went to an eter|nal hell.</P>
<P>THE &s;tate of no one, perhaps, is more hopele&s;s than that of Judas, who betrayed Chri&s;t the Savior of all men; yet not a word is &s;aid of him but what may con&s;i&s;t with his &s;alvation after death. He is called the &s;on of perdition; and it is &s;aid that he went to his own place. All this is but ju&s;t what we may &s;ay of every &s;inner, in kind, though of Judas in a very aggravated degree. Every man is a &s;on of perdition until new born, damned until regenerated. Judas was a notable &s;on of perdition, &s;ignally &s;o, a mo&s;t mi&s;erable, lo&s;t, condemned &s;inner, until his death; in perdition until that moment, even until &s;oul and body were &s;eparated; until then a &s;on of perdition in an extraordinary degree. Paul was &s;o in a woful mea&s;ure. until he died, "<HI>a wretched man,</HI>" with a "<HI>body of death.</HI>" Every man is &s;o, in a &s;ad degree, until the union of &s;oul and body, which fir&s;t contaminated the &s;oul, is di&s;&s;ol|ved;
<PB N="190" REF="030609_0189_0FE82D06D5982AF0">
&s;ome in a greater, and &s;ome in a le&s;s degree, according as the Head of every man, i. e. the Mediator, has been plea&s;ed to ad|vance, or re&s;train his prophetic and kingly power and grace upon the &s;oul.</P>
<P>JUDAS went to his own place, to a very horrible and ignominious death, in awful angui&s;h and utter de&s;pair, in his own mind. His &s;oul went, perhaps, to the lowe&s;t &s;eat provided for the elect human race, by him who died for the &s;ins of the whole world; to the lowe&s;t place among all given to Chri&s;t. Judas being one given to Chri&s;t, as is ex|pre&s;sly declared. Judas was lo&s;t in an awful manner; he was lo&s;t as an apo&s;tle of Chri&s;t; lo&s;t as to all &s;ervice in this world; lo&s;t with regard to all his comfort on earth; lo&s;t as to any hope to &s;upport his own &s;oul here; lo&s;t with re&s;pect to the proper &s;eat of one of the twelve apo&s;tles in the world to come, and with re&s;pect to that dignified lot, in this world, which Matthias took in his place. He was, in fine, &s;o lo&s;t, &s;uch a &s;on of per|dition, and in &s;uch wi&s;e went to his own place, as fully to &s;upport and ju&s;tify the mo&s;t plain and natural import of all the awful things &s;aid in the word of God con|cerning him; without any con&s;ideration of po&s;itive mi&s;ery, after death. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of Ahitophel his type.</P>
<P>WITH regard to the parable of the rich man, in the go&s;pel, who lift up his eyes in hell, being in torments. It implies no per|&s;onal mi&s;ery there; but is one of the many &s;triking di&s;plays of <HI>pure ju&s;tice,</HI> the &s;anction
<PB N="191" REF="030609_0190_0FE82D7A0E1B5018">
of the law, in awful terror. Such di&s;plays will remain forever, as I have &s;aid before, in the full view of all the &s;aints in heaven to all eternity. In the gla&s;s of pure ju&s;tice, they will forever &s;ee, not only this Dives, but them&s;elves al&s;o lifting up their eyes in torments unutterable. And, in this &s;en&s;e, will dwell with devouring fire, and inhabit everla&s;ting burnings. Though in their &s;ure|ty, they &s;hall per&s;onally find a place of de|fence, a munition of rocks, the bread and &s;ure waters of eternal con&s;olation.</P>
<P>I READILY grant, if this di&s;tinction, which I would every where keep in view, between the voice of ju&s;tice, and that of mercy, the di&s;play of law and that of go&s;pel, running through the whole word of God, is without <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">undation, my whole argument falls to the ground. So does the whole of divine reve|lation, for ought I can po&s;&s;ibly di&s;cern, after a mo&s;t careful inquiry, for many years. And (with awful reverence I would &s;peak it,) I am not able, without this di&s;tinction, to vin|dicate the holy bible from many more flat contradictions, than any other book I have ever read. But this di&s;tinction is the pecu|liar glory and my&s;tery of divine revelation.</P>
<P>WE are expre&s;sly told, that even a brother for whom Chri&s;t died, may <HI>peri&s;h.</HI> 1. Cor. viii. 11. This is a term u&s;ed for eternal mi&s;ery, by the <HI>limitarians</HI> them&s;elves, as much as the word <HI>damnation.</HI> The meaning is cer|tainly no more than this: He may fall into &s;nares of infidelity, into many doubts and &s;orrows in this world; may lo&s;e all go&s;pel

con&s;olation, and become a mi&s;erable crea|ture, all his days on earth.</P>
<P>MOREOVER, what our Savior hath &s;aid concerning children, greatly confirms the opinion, that he gave his life "a ran&s;om for all," in the mo&s;t natural &s;en&s;e of the&s;e words of the apo&s;tle.</P>
<P>THE greater part of departed human &s;ouls have left the body, having never arrived at the age of maturity. Chri&s;t tells us, "of &s;uch is the kingdom of heaven." Plainly &s;ignifying, that a great proportion for whom he died, are of this de&s;cription. And he does not at all limit his words to the children of his peculiar people, in pre&s;ent knowledge of his covenant, and pre&s;ent enjoyment of the privileges and comforts of it. This &s;hews that he is the Mediator between God and man, in general, without any exception or di&s;tinction as to final &s;alvation.</P>
<P>THE pa&s;&s;age I have alluded to, may al&s;o carry in it this idea, viz. That all who enjoy heaven, have a meek, humble, dependent, child-like &s;pirit given them. This may be one thing &s;ignified thereby; but this mili|tates not in the lea&s;t again&s;t the con&s;truction I have given, as the main import of the words of Chri&s;t; but is compatible there|with, and the rather confirms it. We hope for the &s;alvation of children of the covenant, dedicated to God by his &s;pecial &s;eal. The &s;ame merits of Chri&s;t, and the &s;ame power of &s;anctifying grace, are as adequate to the &s;alvation of all the little ones in the world.

We all fell in our fir&s;t foederal head, with|out our knowledge or act in the ca&s;e; and all mankind are re&s;tored in the &s;econd foed|eral head in like manner. Otherwi&s;e grace does not abound <HI>much more;</HI> but indeed <HI>much le&s;s.</HI> This idea of the kind Parent of all, gives us a father's con&s;olation when we follow to the grave our dear children, who are often &s;wept away by death in &s;uch mul|titudes. Read Jeremiah xxxi. 15, 16, 17. We can yet &s;ay, "the Lord is good unto all, and his tender mercies are over all."

<P>MUCH is &s;aid about being fit to die. There is one fitne&s;s and but one, and that is by no means per&s;onal; but in the perfect character of a Covenant Head, a Vicar, or Surety, in the full atonement, and all per|fect worthine&s;s of Je&s;us. Whatever differ|ence progre&s;&s;ive grace may make between mankind in this life, (and great is the ble&s;|&s;ing of all tho&s;e who are elected to &s;pecial attainments of grace in this world) yet every one without di&s;tinction, is left utterly unfit for heaven, &s;o long as the &s;oul is in the body, an awful unclean thing. No unclean thing &s;hall enter into that world. On the &s;epa|ration, and not before, is any &s;oul in its own temper and qualifications fit; but in a relative view, all for whom Chri&s;t died, are &s;o. Their garments are all alike wa&s;hed and made white in the blood of the Lamb.

What was done for David, Daniel and Paul, at the moment of &s;eparation, that they might enter paradi&s;e with &s;potle&s;s purity, was of the &s;elf-&s;ame nature, and not twice &s;o much in degree, as might qualify Pharaoh, Ahab, and Judas for the &s;ame world: For no man on earth, to his la&s;t breath, was ever yet &s;anc|tified to the one half, or ever made progre&s;s in holine&s;s one half way from a &s;tate of total depravity, to a &s;tate of complete holine&s;s.</P>
<P>MY reader if you are left as you are found at your la&s;t breath, you mu&s;t know that your &s;oul will be too unclean for heaven, or el&s;e you know very little of your&s;elf. In Chri&s;t, all things are ready for all, and equally ready at all times, without any con|&s;ideration in the univer&s;e, but what is drawn from God alone in a glorious, all &s;ufficient Mediator. God is all in all, and Chri&s;t is all in all. Thus the primitive preachers of Chri&s;t warned <HI>every man,</HI> and taught <HI>every man,</HI> in all wi&s;dom: That they might pre|&s;ent <HI>every man</HI> perfect in Chri&s;t Je&s;us. Col. i. And I am bold to &s;ay, that any child of Adam that tru&s;ts to any di&s;tinction in his own heart or life, in the lea&s;t to &s;upport the heart in a dying hour, or to any thing but Je&s;us Chri&s;t alone and him crucified, <HI>&s;hall be all his life time &s;ubject to bondage through fear of death;</HI> and, thus abiding, &s;hall find no relief, until the departed &s;pirit is taught better, in the arms of him who has the keys of hell and of death. The notion of &s;ome fitne&s;s in a &s;inner for heaven, whether a pe|nitent or an impenitent &s;inner, is utterly re|pugnant

to the whole word of God. It is built wholly on a legal &s;pirit, and on our attachment to the old covenant of works. It wars again&s;t every evangelical motive of comfort in our &s;ouls, and obedience in our lives. It &s;tands in oppo&s;ition to an intire dependance on God in Chri&s;t, and to every moral virtue. Hence we do not allow God his proper character and place, nor take our own: "We ob&s;erve lying vanities and for|&s;ake our own mercies."</P>
<P>IT is an evidence of the true go&s;pel: That when it is impre&s;&s;ed on the heart, it makes men better in their morals than before.</P>
<P>THE <HI>limitarians</HI> urge this argument again&s;t all the cavils rai&s;ed from the doctrines of God's decrees, of free &s;overeign grace, and of the certain per&s;everance of believers. And they have ever well maintained their ground, by dint of rea&s;on, experience and divine revelation. The doctrine I plead for, takes full advantage of every argument they adduce, and enforces them all with va&s;t ad|ditional &s;trength. They &s;ay, and that tru|ly, that the di&s;plays of God's mercy and love, always draw the heart to love God, and to keep his commandments. How much more &s;hall the&s;e more glorious and exten|&s;ive di&s;plays of the love and mercy of God, in the &s;elf &s;ame way, melt the whole &s;oul in|to the obedience of love, and produce every moral virtue in the life of man?</P>

believe it, but on tho&s;e who do? We know that every go&s;pel doctrine is turned to bad account, by impenitent, unbelieving men. They all turn the grace of God into wan|tonne&s;s; while true believers are purified by their faith, and led into all holine&s;s of life. There is not one objection of licentiou&s;ne&s;s again&s;t this doctrine, which does not lie, in full force, and much greater force, again&s;t every <HI>limitarian</HI> doctrine of <HI>free, &s;overeign grace.</HI></P>
<P>THEY who have built on the highe&s;t prin|ciples of &s;overeign grace, and have mo&s;t of all &s;et at nought all fitne&s;s in men for &s;alva|tion, but in Chri&s;t alone, have ever been the mo&s;t moral and virtuous in their lives: While, on the other hand, they who could not endure a thought of the ab&s;olute decrees and &s;overeignty of God, and &s;alvation by mere mercy in Chri&s;t, exclu&s;ive from every qualification in man, to move the heart of God towards him; and have plead for power and merit and free will of their own creat|ing, have too often been a di&s;&s;olute, a|bandoned part of mankind. The higher thoughts men have of God, and the lower of them&s;elves; the better their morals always have been, and always will be. Therefore, as this doctrine, which I am &s;upporting, car|ries the&s;e &s;entiments to a much greater ex|tent than any <HI>imitarian</HI> doctrine: So it will, if cordially believed, produce much better morals.</P>

yet had any power to re&s;train an hardened &s;inner from &s;in; much le&s;s to make him love virtue.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t abandoned in wickedne&s;s, in all ages, have believed in the doctrine of hell torments, as much as a hardened &s;inner can believe any thing of the invi&s;ible world. They have always been wont to allude to the&s;e torments, in their common conver&s;a|tion, as a matter indi&s;putable. They have hell and damnation in their mouths, all the day long. But did all this ever, in the lea&s;t, prevent their &s;tealing, cur&s;ing, &s;wearing, committing adultery, fighting with one ano|ther, or any horrid bla&s;phemy they were addicted to? Never in the lea&s;t. Now if any imagine the mo&s;t exten&s;ive doctrines of divine goodne&s;s will make hardened &s;inners wor&s;e than they now are; they have yet to &s;tudy human nature, and the common ways of the world.</P>
<P>GIVE an old, veteran, profane &s;ailor, a guinea in &s;ome &s;pecial di&s;tre&s;s he is in, and he will not u&s;e a bad word if he knows it will offend you. But threaten him with eternal damnation for his &s;in, and tell him his pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s is ju&s;t upon him, and he will cur&s;e you to your face. Men ought in|deed, to be deterred from &s;in by fear of hell: For hell in an awful degree, and the pains of it attend all &s;in; and the eternity of hell torments can be avoided in no way, but by for&s;aking &s;in, no more on my plan than any other. But <HI>ought</HI> is one thing, and <HI>fact</HI> is another. Whatever hardened
<PB N="198" REF="030609_0197_0FE82E5A8AE5E6D8">
&s;inners ought to do, and from whatever mo|tives; I &s;ay, it is fact in all ages, the world throughout, that they never did mend their ways, from a fear of any thing in the invi&s;i|ble world. It has ever been fact, that when they have had mo&s;t of hell and damnation in their mouths, they have gone on mo&s;t daringly in their wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P>IT is readily granted, that awakened &s;in|ners, with whom the &s;pirit of God is on his u&s;ual way to bring them to a &s;en&s;e of the &s;alvation of God, will be much re&s;trained from all immorality, under &s;uch &s;pecial a|wakenings; yet all the&s;e will not bring them into the love and practice of holine&s;s and virtue, as will a &s;en&s;e of the love of God's redeeming love. Under all the&s;e legal a|wakenings and re&s;traints from open vice, <HI>they will only change their mode of &s;inning,</HI> un|til the grace of God that <HI>bringeth &s;alvation,</HI> appears to their &s;ouls: Which alone will effectually teach them to deny all ungodli|ne&s;s and every worldly lu&s;t. But then, let it be well noted that the doctrine I plead for, &s;ecures every advantage and re&s;traint of awakening grace, as fully as any <HI>limitarian</HI> doctrine ever did, or can. I maintain the &s;ame doctrine in the true nature of it; the &s;ame nece&s;&s;ity of conviction and conver&s;ion, that they do. We differ not a &s;ingle atom, as to the way and manner of application; but only in this, I extend the glorious work of God, and every good influence of it, much further than they do.</P>

Their open &s;in in the &s;ight of the world, is much le&s;s than before; and there is a good token, that the &s;pirit of God is on his u&s;ual way to bring them to &s;aving good.

of mind?

<P>THE love of God will make us love all as he does, according to our mea&s;ure of love, and to be co-workers together with God. A principle of this nature moves tender af|fection in all other ca&s;es. You have a very dear, earthly friend, that is ab&s;ent afar off, who has left a little child with you. The re|membrance of your friend, and how he &s;et his affections on that child, and what tender concern he continually has for the child, will affect your heart with tenderne&s;s, pity and love, every time you look on the little helple&s;s creature; even though it be, a per|ver&s;e child. The love of your mo&s;t dear friend, will make you always exceeding kind to his child, as an object of his love. Your care will extend to his other property, le&s;s

valuable&punc; which you have any concern with or knowledge of. So, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, when you &s;ee any poor, perver&s;e &s;inners on earth, your love to God and Chri&s;t will cau&s;e your heart, on the true go&s;pel princi|ple, to &s;ay, "My God made them in his love; and in his great love and pity he pre|&s;erves them. My dear Savior died for them, in the greatne&s;s of his love. God hath a de|&s;ire to the&s;e works of his hands. The heart of my be&s;t beloved even bleeds with com|pa&s;&s;ion, love and pity to the&s;e poor creatures. My love to my Savior makes me feel towards the&s;e unworthy, mi&s;erable objects, as he doth. He is exceedingly good to the&s;e evil, un|thankful creatures; and the love of God con&s;traineth me to feel towards them, as God and Chri&s;t do towards them and me." There is verily no other fountain of go&s;pel charity but this: No other principle that can make us feel towards the vile&s;t of &s;inners, as God commands us. But this "charity believeth all things, and hopeth all things," certainly not excluding the capital point. This cha|rity is the radical grace in the &s;oul of man, and "the bond of perfectne&s;s."</P>

<P>THE above &s;entiment is without any rea|&s;on, or any thing in divine revelation to warrant the &s;uppo&s;ition. All want purgation at the moment of death, as really as any one. Sanctification is far, very far from be|ing complete, while the &s;inner breathes, whether a penitent or impenitent &s;inner. In both there is much unholine&s;s, while life re|mains. No unclean thing &s;hall enter hea|ven; and, of certain con&s;equence, not the be&s;t &s;aint, not any mere man that ever lived, as he was in the la&s;t moment of his life.</P>
<P>WHATEVER is done before, for us mi&s;era|ble &s;inners, it is certain, the mo&s;t of all will be done in the parting moment, to &s;eparate us from pollution, and fit us for glory. All then mu&s;t go into purgation, if any: Though it were granted that a &s;horter period would &s;uffice for &s;ome than for others; which is not true, as will &s;oon appear.

moment before we expire, the be&s;t do ju&s;t|ly cry out. O wretched men that we are; we have a body of death, and who &s;hall deliver us from it! We &s;hall all be poor, wretched &s;inners in that moment, whenever it comes, and under greater guilt then, than ever before, in our&s;elves con&s;idered: For we &s;hall con|tinually add many &s;ins, and atone for none. The &s;ame infinite mercy, power, and faith|fulne&s;s, which can then &s;eparate one &s;oul from all its unfitne&s;s for heaven, can another. Chri&s;t does but a &s;mall part of his glorious work on any &s;oul in this life. He graciou&s;ly begins earlier with &s;ome than others; but he fini&s;hes with all alike, even at death. "The la&s;t enemy that &s;hall be de&s;troyed is death. I will make this la&s;t even as thee."</P>
<P>WE are very plainly taught in the word of God, that every &s;oul goes immediately after death, into an eternal, fixed &s;tate; which never more admits of any alteration, but in progre&s;&s;ive degree; the &s;ame in kind, un|changeable to endle&s;s duration. The &s;pe|cial manner in which Enoch and Elijah went out of the world, does not make them differ from that of all mankind in this re&s;pect; viz. That they were both &s;o far from perfect holine&s;s, the moment before their tran&s;lation, as to be utterly unfit for the pure glories of heaven. Yea, they were much more fit for hell, <HI>in them&s;elves,</HI> as neither they, nor any other man had ever arrived half way to &s;in|le&s;s perfection while in the body. Yet, it is &s;ure, they both went direct to heaven. The thief on the cro&s;s was mi&s;erably unprepared
<PB N="205" REF="030609_0204_0FE82E88B83728B8">
for paradi&s;e, as long as he was dying; but when dead, he went there, with the human &s;oul of Je&s;us. Lazarus went as directly to that world when he died, as the rich man went, <HI>in the voice of the law,</HI> to hell, and as all go there, when they die, <HI>in the &s;ame holy &s;enti|ment of the law.</HI> Paul de&s;ired to depart, not for &s;ome AGES of purgation and humiliation, but to be with Chri&s;t; although he groaned under his body of death, more than under the dying pangs of his body. And there is every rea&s;on to prove, that all the redeemed &s;inners, for whom Chri&s;t gave him&s;elf a ran|&s;om, &s;hall go there as immediately after death, as the poor, hateful thief.</P>
<P>WE are taught the &s;ame truth, from the early periods of divine revelation. All the uncleanne&s;&s;es mentioned in the mo&s;aic in&s;ti|tution, and all the purgations there, repre|&s;ent, as all allow, our moral or &s;piritual pollutions, and our moral or &s;piritual clean&s;|ing. A day there denotes oftentimes the day or &s;ea&s;on of life, and the evening, death, or the clo&s;e of life. How many times is it repeated, that the polluted and the unclean, in a ceremonial &s;en&s;e, though they wa&s;h their cloaths and bathe them&s;elves in water, (de|noting all the means of grace and &s;anctifica|tion in this life) yet &s;hall be unclean until the even? But it is &s;aid of all &s;owing &s;eeds, in like ca&s;es, that they &s;hall be clean. Levit. xi. And in many other places, needle&s;s here to quote. Seed &s;own and &s;pringing up again, is a well known &s;imile, denoting our death and re&s;urrection. "It is &s;own a natu|ral
<PB N="206" REF="030609_0205_0FE82E80C9780AB0">
body, it is rai&s;ed a &s;piritual body." So in the type alluded to, we die mo&s;t dread|fully unclean; yet no un&s;afe con&s;equence &s;hall follow, any more than it was un&s;afe to &s;ow polluted &s;eed, for fear the pollution would not be taken out in the ground, and that the ri&s;ing crop would be all unclean.</P>
<P>THE human body goes into the grave an awfully polluted thing; but does not ari&s;e &s;o. It is &s;own in di&s;honor and weakne&s;s, it is rai&s;ed in honor and glory. Our bones will be full of the &s;in of our youth, which will be buried together with us in the du&s;t; but will not ari&s;e with us, except in the holy voice of law: And in that &s;en&s;e all mankind &s;hall awake to &s;hame and everla&s;ting con|tempt, and abide &s;o forever; but in go&s;pel language and <HI>certain effect,</HI> all &s;hall awake to everla&s;ting life. Sin lies down, but does not ari&s;e. "His bones are full of the &s;in of his youth, which &s;hall lie down with him in the du&s;t." Job xx. Sin and its attendants &s;hall vex and di&s;tre&s;s the wicked as long as they live; and hurry them on in all its dreadful rage and malignity while they live. It &s;hall even drive them to death, "to the king of terrors;" but no further.</P>
<P>THE utmo&s;t torment, for a long period, even for <HI>ages of ages,</HI> could have no more effect in humbling &s;inners of the human, than of the angelic nature. The devils are no better, for their long continued angui&s;h and pain. Afflictions in this world, do not make &s;inners any better; but are invariably, only an occa&s;ion of their growing wor&s;e and
<PB N="207" REF="030609_0206_0FE82E8A443A7D30">
wor&s;e, if the &s;pecial, almighty energy of the divine Spirit does not attend them. There is not the lea&s;t intimation of the operation of the Spirit of God, or of any means of grace in hell; in whatever &s;en&s;e any under|&s;tand that awful &s;tate, whether as a &s;tate of real, per&s;onal &s;uffering, or as the pure voice or di&s;play of ju&s;tice. The devils have been under the&s;e per&s;onal &s;ufferings, for a long time, and are no more humble than ever, no more fit for heaven. And had it been the decree of God, that all mankind &s;hould be there in per&s;on with them, ever &s;o long, they would grow wor&s;e and wor&s;e, through all ages of ages; for ought that their intolerable torments would do for them. Almighty power could create their hearts anew, even in hell, as ea&s;ily as on earth. God has power enough to change the natures of all the devils there; but, he has not told us he ever will do it, and we know of no &s;avior provided for them, or that ever will be.</P>
<P>UNTO us a Savior is born; unto us God's own Son is given; and he has been plea&s;ed to make known to us his decrees of infinite love and mercy. The love and kindne&s;s of God to man hath appeared, not by works of righteou&s;ne&s;s which we have done, or can do; but by his mere mercy he &s;aves man, by the wa&s;hing of regeneration, and the renewing of the Holy Gho&s;t, which he hath &s;hed on us, on all mankind abund|antly; though on different per&s;ons and peo|ple, and in different ages and periods of
<PB N="208" REF="030609_0207_0FE82E8251671018">
time, in a very different degree, as the great and holy Sovereign hath &s;een fit.</P>
<P>UPON the true, go&s;pel doctrine, that God will have all men to be &s;aved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth: That the Lamb of God hath taken away the &s;in of the whole world: That Chri&s;t is inve&s;ted with regal power, as Mediator, to gather to|gether in one all things in him&s;elf: That as far as &s;in hath reigned unto death, grace &s;hall reign through righteou&s;ne&s;s to eternal life by Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord: And that the la&s;t enemy he will de&s;troy is death, crying in exalted triumph, O death! I will be thy plague: O grave! I will be thy de&s;truction: On this plain go&s;pel doctrine, I &s;ay, it is wholly without rea&s;on or &s;cripture, to &s;up|po&s;e that the mi&s;eries of man &s;hall reach beyond death.</P>
<P>THE conte&s;t between the Mediator and his grand adver&s;ary, or the two oppo&s;ite &s;eeds, is very often, and very ju&s;tly repre|&s;ented under the &s;imilitude of a long war, or a long, ob&s;tinate battle. It is every where affirmed that the Savior of the human race &s;hall obtain the victory, and a full complete victory too. The adver&s;ary &s;hall &s;ucceed no further than to brui&s;e the heel; which is not a wound that &s;hall terminate in that death, <HI>everla&s;ting&punc; per&s;onal death,</HI> which he aimed at. It &s;hall admit of a cure. But the &s;eed of the woman &s;hall brui&s;e the head of the ad|ver&s;ary; give a fatal &s;troke, where a brui&s;e by almighty &s;trength is certain death; and
<PB N="209" REF="030609_0208_0FE82E67F16F6540">
&s;o far as we know, it will admit of no cure. Such will be the victory of Chri&s;t over the &s;erpent.</P>
<P>WHEN two armies go to battle, if the one, only with the lo&s;s of an hundred men, &s;lay ten thou&s;and of the adver&s;e party and take al|mo&s;t all the re&s;t pri&s;oners with great &s;poil, we &s;ay there is a great and triumphant victory gained; yea, we are ready to call it a com|plete triumph, even though the victors lo&s;e a few men in battle, and a few more are taken captives by the retreating foe. Ju&s;t &s;uch will be the victory of &s;atan, upon the <HI>limitarian</HI> plan. The re&s;cued of the Lord will be only a very few, amid&s;t the general overthrow of mankind. Satan will obtain a great and awful victory, though not &s;o in|tire and complete as he could have wi&s;hed: Not wholly without lo&s;s; but almo&s;t &s;o. Now is this like the repre&s;entation of the rencounter, the great conte&s;t, in which the Almighty Son of God hath engaged again&s;t his adver&s;ary, and the grand adver&s;ary of his dear offspring of the human kind?</P>
<P>THE point &s;atan aimed at, was to involve us all in death, temporal, &s;piritual, and eter|nal. Chri&s;t &s;et him&s;elf in full oppo&s;ition to the whole purpo&s;e of &s;atan, that no evil, <HI>none at all</HI> on the whole, &s;hould accrue to man from all the malice, and all the deadly works of, the devil. Chri&s;t's aim was as ex|ten&s;ive as &s;atan's; as good as the devil's was bad. HE UNDERTOOK WITH AS MUCH BENEVOLENCE, AS SATAN DID WITH MA|LICE.
<PB N="210" REF="030609_0209_0FE82EC0834C2590">
He aimed at no partial victory, much le&s;s at a re&s;cue of a very few, leaving the field and a triumphant victory to his adver|sary.</P>
<P>THE Mediator, the Head of every man a|bundantly a&s;&s;ures us, that his victory &s;hall be complete. "I will ran&s;om them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death: O death! I will be thy plagues; O grave! I will be thy de&s;truc|tion: Repentance &s;hall be hid from mine eyes." Ho&s;. xiii. 14. So in Heb. ii. we find the union of Chri&s;t with human nature, <HI>with every man,</HI> as fully a&s;&s;erted as words can expre&s;s; together with the end of his under|taking, and of all his &s;ufferings. "That he by the grace of God &s;hould ta&s;te death <HI>for every man;</HI>" and "that through death he might de&s;troy him that had the power of death, that is the devil;" and "that he might deliver them (without any exception mentioned) who, through fear of death, were all their life time &s;ubject to bondage:" Which is mo&s;t of all the ca&s;e of poor, di&s;tre&s;|&s;ed &s;inners, who under conviction, feel them|&s;elves, of all mankind, the lea&s;t qualified for heaven and the mo&s;t fit for hell: Indeed, all other &s;inners al&s;o, tremble at a realiz|ing thought of death. The great Redeemer &s;peaks without any, the lea&s;t exception, when he &s;ays, "&s;hall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive delivered? But thus &s;aith the Lord, even the captives of the mighty &s;hall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible &s;hall be delivered; for I will
<PB N="211" REF="030609_0210_0FE82F4073F29D50">
contend with him that contendeth. with thee, and I will &s;ave thy children." I&s;a. xlix. 24, 25.</P>
<P>THE Holy Gho&s;t &s;peaks of man without any di&s;tinction, in words like the&s;e: His &s;oul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the de&s;troyers&punc; if there be a me&s;&s;enger with him, an interpreter, one among a thou|&s;and, to &s;hew unto man his uprightne&s;s: Then he is gracious unto him, and &s;aith, de|liver him from going down to the pit, I have found a ran&s;om." Job xxxiii. Here it is mo&s;t plain, that the di&s;covery, interpre|tation, or di&s;play of the Mediator's <HI>own righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> is the &s;ole relief of the guilty, without any the lea&s;t qualification or di&s;tinc|tion in the &s;inful creature.</P>
<P>THE holy &s;criptures every where abound with thoughts corre&s;pondent to the pa&s;&s;ages now cited. There is nothing that looks like a victory of &s;atan over the Son of man, in any part or degree; though it is well known, the whole human kind are the prize con|tended for. All is quite the rever&s;e. Chri&s;t rideth forth conquering and to conquer. "He hath led captivity captive, and receiv|ed gifts for men, yea, for the <HI>rebellious</HI> al&s;o, that the Lord our God might dwell among them." P&s;alm lxviii. "For it plea&s;ed the Father, that in him &s;hould all fulne&s;s dwell; and (having made peace, through the blood of his cro&s;s) <HI>by him,</HI> to reconcile all things to him&s;elf, <HI>by him,</HI> I &s;ay, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven." "For in him dwelleth all the &s;ulne&s;s of the God-head
<PB N="212" REF="030609_0211_0FE82F41FB9A7028">
bodily; and ye are complete in him, who is the head of all principality and power." "Blotting out the hand writing of ordinan|ces, which was again&s;t us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cro&s;s; and hav|ing &s;poiled principalities and powers, he made a &s;hew of them openly, triumphing over them in it." Col. i. and ii. The holy &s;criptures every where announce, not only &s;ome benefit to mankind by Chri&s;t, a &s;mall, partial re&s;cue from mi&s;ery; &s;ome valuable &s;aving to the human kind; but a redemption, a victory over <HI>&s;atan, death,</HI> and <HI>mi&s;ery,</HI> FULL, COMPLETE, and ETERNAL.</P>
<P>IT is utterly impertinent for any one to &s;ay, that this victory may be &s;o complete, and yet mo&s;t of the human race, or indeed any of them, may be in per&s;onal mi&s;ery to endle&s;s duration: And that God may have his own full glory, and the mo&s;t benevolent &s;y&s;tem may be e&s;tabli&s;hed, notwith&s;tanding. We mu&s;t attend to the very thing contended for by &s;atan, on the one part, and by the Son of God on the other. On the part of the ad|ver&s;ary, the matter contended for, is the in|tire, complete, eternal, univer&s;al mi&s;ery of all mankind: The Son of God does flatly, and fully oppo&s;e &s;atan, in this very thing. Otherwi&s;e there is no war between them&punc; i. e. if the devil is driving at one thing, and the Savior oppo&s;ing another. But the oppo&s;i|tion is direct and full; as above &s;tated.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE &s;atan to &s;ay, "I will have the human kind mi&s;erable with me to all eterni|ty:" And Chri&s;t to &s;ay, "So you &s;hall,
<PB N="213" REF="030609_0212_0FE82F46993F8040">
mo&s;t of them; but I will have my glory in it." Here is concurrence in the main. The variance and oppo&s;ition is very &s;mall. But we know, that the &s;eed of the woman does oppo&s;e &s;atan, <HI>in full;</HI> and will not let him gain that very point he aimed at, either in whole, or in any part: Hence, he makes even the pains of this life, and natural death, not only to turn to his own glory, but to the real advantage and happine&s;s of man. Satan never &s;o much as hoped, or in the lea&s;t aimed to ob&s;truct the happine&s;s or glory of God; for he always knew it was utterly im|po&s;&s;ible for him to do it, in the lea&s;t degree. The complete, eternal mi&s;ery of all man|kind was the &s;ole point he aimed at; and this is the plain &s;cripture repre&s;entation of the matter. The Savior fully and flatly op|po&s;ed him in that very point; and this alone can make a proper war, a true and direct contention. The Me&s;&s;iah did not &s;ay to &s;a|tan, "You &s;hall have your will in the main, and I will have mine too:" But "you &s;hall not have your will at all, and I will have mine wholly." "I will overcome and con|quer you, on your cho&s;en ground, on which you contend to make all the human kind for|ever mi&s;erable. The human kind &s;hall be as happy, as univer&s;ally &s;o, and even more completely &s;o, than if you had never deter|mined on their ruin." This is a proper op|po&s;ition; and in this the Almighty Savior will be victorious.</P>
<P>BUT alas! the <HI>limitarian</HI> plan gives &s;atan a grand victory and triumph, in all he had
<PB N="214" REF="030609_0213_0FE82EFEB66CF3F0">
in view, or ever had any hope to accompli&s;h. It con&s;iders Chri&s;t as concurring with him, <HI>in the main,</HI> in all that he de&s;ired; though, in another way, getting glory to him&s;elf, and making the victory and triumph of &s;a|tan only an occa&s;ion of it. Here is very little oppo&s;ition. The devil has got his will in one thing, and the Savior in another. Satan expected, in his mo&s;t &s;anguine hopes, little more than what he will obtain; and Chri&s;t never meant to make any <HI>great oppo|&s;ition</HI> to the devil, while &s;eeking whom he may devour; though in another way he would &s;ecure his own glory. Con&s;ult the &s;acred oracles throughout, and let common &s;en&s;e &s;ay, whether there is any thing in all this, that bears the mo&s;t di&s;tant likene&s;s to the direct and full oppo&s;ition, between the &s;eed of the woman and the &s;erpent contend|ing <HI>for one and the &s;ame thing,</HI> even hu|man happine&s;s.</P>
<P>SATAN &s;hall not finally have his will in the lea&s;t part, or degree; though for a &s;ea|&s;on he may be gratified: For divine wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s have ordained, that there &s;hall be a long contention, and the war not &s;oon over. Yet, in the end, &s;atan &s;hall be wholly overcome and di&s;appointed in every view, and in every hope that he has entertained. The prize in conte&s;t may be divided for a time; and &s;atan may &s;eem to have the grea|ter &s;hare of it. It has indeed been &s;o ever &s;ince the fall, to this day; and may be &s;o to the end of this pre&s;ent world. But in the re&s;ult, &s;atan &s;hall lo&s;e <HI>all</HI>; and the Son of
<PB N="215" REF="030609_0214_0FE82EF0AF8FDF70">
God gain all, even the whole prize in di&s;|pute, and even de&s;troy him that for a time, a long &s;ea&s;on, has the power of death. His victory &s;hall be complete; though for a long time God divides him a portion with the great (adver&s;ary) and he divides the &s;poil with the &s;trong. Since he hath poured out his &s;oul unto death, and &s;ince God hath laid upon him the iniquity of <HI>us all,</HI> and he hath been numbered with tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, and bare the &s;in of many, i. e. as many as tho&s;e, who&s;e iniquities were laid upon him, even "US ALL," all the human kind; he will, in his own way and time, make the ap|plication &s;ure. He will make interce&s;&s;ion for the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors. I&s;ai. liii. Not a word of exception or limitation is mentioned in the pa&s;&s;ages now alluded to.</P>
<P>THE word <HI>many,</HI> is often u&s;ed in &s;cripture to &s;ignify all the human kind. The re&s;ur|rection of all the dead is expre&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame manner. Dan. xii. Al&s;o the apo&s;tacy of the human race: "By one man's di&s;obe|dience <HI>many</HI> were made &s;inners." Rom. v. Indeed it is the common language of &s;crip|ture. The reader will multiply quotations as many as he plea&s;es. The word <HI>many</HI> &s;o u&s;ed, is often explained by the &s;ynonimous term <HI>all;</HI> and often the plain &s;en&s;e and con|nection of the context &s;o explains it. So in the pa&s;&s;age above cited out of the prophet I&s;aiah, God laid on Chri&s;t the iniquity of <HI>us all,</HI> and he bare the &s;in of <HI>many,</HI> i. e. the &s;ame number, the whole number of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors;
<PB N="216" REF="030609_0215_0FE82F4A00EC5BD0">
and his effectual interce&s;&s;ion &s;hall he for ju&s;t &s;o many, in the final re&s;ult.</P>
<P>THE kingdom of Je&s;us, in this world, hath ever appeared feeble, like a brai&s;ed reed and like &s;moaking flax; and the kingdom of &s;a|tan hath appeared in pomp and power; but this will not forbid a complete victory on the part of the Mediator in the end. "He &s;hall not fail nor be di&s;couraged, until he have &s;et judgment in the earth: And the I&s;les &s;hall wait for his law:" He will, in his own time, "open blind eyes and bring out the pri&s;oners from the pri&s;on, and them that &s;it in darkne&s;s out of the pri&s;on-hou&s;e. I am the Lord, that is my name, and my glory will I not give to another, neither my prai&s;e to graven images." I&s;a. xlii. 1.&mdash;16. Satan hath long led away mo&s;t of the na|tions after images, and into various kinds of idolatry; but Chri&s;t will finally reclaim as many as &s;atan hath deluded. "God will gather together in one all things in Chri&s;t." Yea, wherever" &s;in hath abounded, grace &s;hall much more abound." The mat|ter immediately in conte&s;t is the weal or woe of the human kind.</P>
<Q><L>"What can awake thee unawak'd by this,</L>
<L>"Expended Deity on human weal!"</L></Q>
<P>IT is, moreover, worthy of our &s;pecial no|tice that throughout the books of Mo&s;es, and indeed through the whole of the old te&s;ta|ment, there is very little &s;aid of ble&s;&s;ings, or of cur&s;es, of happine&s;s, or of mi&s;ery, but what is temporal and pertains to this pre&s;ent life, as every attentive reader of the &s;acred
<PB N="217" REF="030609_0216_0FE82EC20A9A2C20">
books will immediately recollect. And when the word <HI>hell</HI> is mentioned any where in the old te&s;tament, it very &s;eldom, perhaps never, &s;ignifies any other than the grave, or &s;tate of the dead in general. The cur&s;es on the di&s;obedient are every where mainly &s;uch as take place in this world, or terminate in the grave; &s;o are the ble&s;&s;ings promi&s;ed to the obedient. Citations from the &s;cripture would be almo&s;t endle&s;s, the reader has them in his own memory without number. How &s;hall we account for this, but upon the &s;up|po&s;ition that no di&s;tinction &s;hall remain be|yond death, except a di&s;tinction in degree of happine&s;s, by the glorious Savior of all men?</P>
<P>SIN is an infinite evil in its own nature; and nothing at all ought, or can be &s;aid in excu&s;e for it on our part: Yet, at the &s;ame time, it is not ami&s;s for us to know that we do not, <HI>cannot</HI> hurt God by it, or in the lea&s;t infringe upon his uninterrupted and infinite happine&s;s, or add in the lea&s;t thereunto by all our holine&s;s and virtue. We do much harm to our fellow men and to our&s;elves by our wickedne&s;s, and much good by our vir|tues: But the e&s;&s;ential glory and happine&s;s of God is untouched by both. "If thou &s;inne&s;t, what doe&s;t thou again&s;t him, or if thy tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions be multiplied, what doe&s;t thou unto him? if thou be righteous, what give&s;t thou him, or what receiveth he of thine hand? thy wickedne&s;s may hurt a man
<PB N="218" REF="030609_0217_0FE82EAA24C34CF8">
as thou art, and thy righteou&s;ne&s;s may pro|fit the &s;on of man." Job xxxv. 6, 7, 8.</P>
<P>WITH regard to God Mo&s;t High, his eter|nal, fixed will and choice was never yet fru&s;trated in any &s;ingle in&s;tance, and never will be. This by no means excu&s;es &s;in on our part. The mere nature of it is infinite guilt in us, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance. Yet it is certain that every thing, every event in the natural and moral &s;y&s;tem, does take place ju&s;t, exactly, as God cho&s;e and fixed in his immutable plan, before any creature had exi&s;tence. Saint Paul grants this, when the thought is &s;ugge&s;ted even with a view to a bad improvement of it. The apo&s;tle gives the proper character of God, as ab&s;olute pro|prietor, ab&s;olute &s;overeign of all things, and &s;ets up his ab&s;olute decrees and immutable plan, agreeably to the nature and perfections of &s;uch a God. The objector then &s;teps in and &s;ays, "why then doth he yet find fault, for who hath re&s;i&s;ted his will?" Upon this doctrine how can &s;inners be worthy of blame? Paul does not take back a &s;ingle word he had &s;aid, but mo&s;t &s;olemnly reprimands the bold objector, who would on this ground ju&s;tify his &s;in; by holding up to his view the holy nature and character of JEHOVAH, as <HI>ab&s;olute proprietor</HI> and <HI>ab&s;olute &s;overeign</HI> of all things; and he &s;till maintains the principle he had laid down, without the lea&s;t recantation. Rom. ix.</P>
<P>MUCH has been &s;aid again&s;t this true and proper character of God, as fixing his own immutable plan, both in the natural and in
<PB N="219" REF="030609_0218_0FE82F021C6B6FB8">
the moral &s;y&s;tem, and &s;eeing it executed through all the &s;cenes of providence, from beginning to end, without the lea&s;t po&s;&s;ible variation. But all is in vain. We never can get rid of it, unle&s;s we will rid our&s;elves of the word of God, and of the plain light of nature, with all our ju&s;t natural notions of the Supreme Being. We may even as well reject God him&s;elf, his very being, as to de|ny that all events were by him fixed and certain, in his own eternal, infinite mind, before creation began; or that God had in|finite right &s;o to e&s;tabli&s;h his own plan of operation. Paul maintains this point, and pleads only this, to &s;ilence effectually every objector, who would on this ground, ju&s;tify the nature of &s;in, when it is immediately known and plainly felt in the &s;oul, to be, <HI>in its own nature,</HI> directly oppo&s;ite to the nature and attributes of God. As though he had &s;aid, "you &s;inner, have not fru&s;trated the eternal plan of the Mo&s;t High, it is true, and you never can; but it is enough for you to know that your will and heart has been &s;et to do it. This very thing is your guilt, and there can be no guilt, no blame worthine&s;s in the univer&s;e, in any thing el&s;e; but in the evil will and di&s;po&s;ition, in its nature and operations. You therefore have merited unutterable puni&s;hment. But I will main|tain the character of my God; if I relin|qui&s;h this idea of JEHOVAH, I can find no Supreme Being."</P>
<P>I WOULD add: However wicked and un|rea&s;onable it is to abu&s;e this ju&s;t idea of God,
<PB N="220" REF="030609_0219_0FE82F50666BF000">
to indulge in &s;in; yet we may and ought to make a very comfortable u&s;e of it in another way. We ought not once to imagine that we have hurt the MOST HIGH in the lea&s;t, by all our odious &s;ins, as we hurt our fellow men and our own &s;ouls by them. God is infinitely happy in every thing that is done, every event, both in the natural and moral &s;y&s;tem. The whole is ju&s;t what infinite wi&s;|dom and love decreed, and the whole forms the mo&s;t lovely and benevolent &s;y&s;tem, of all po&s;&s;ible &s;y&s;tems that were in the eternal, infinite view of Deity.</P>
<P>THE nature of &s;in is, <HI>in the fir&s;t in&s;tance,</HI> an object of &s;orrow in our hearts; but its <HI>exi&s;t|ence, connections, and all its effects and con&s;e|quences</HI> pertain to the pure and holy, wi&s;e and good government of the mo&s;t high God; all who&s;e ways are holy, ju&s;t, and good. God need not puni&s;h poor &s;inners, to re|trieve any harm they have done him, any damage, any infringement on his happine&s;s. God is, and ever has been, and ever will be, ju&s;t as happy as his &s;oul hath cho&s;en to be, i. e. infinitely &s;o. With infinite plea&s;ure he &s;ees the operation of his own eternal plan, in every part and every movement of it. And mankind, in God's own time and way, will behold it as God does, and delight in it as God does, according to their capacity. We are in guilt and ignorance and &s;orrow for a time, and all is ju&s;t: For the will of God cannot be otherwi&s;e. But, as the nature, of God is love, he will bring us all, "in due time," to &s;ee and approve of
<PB N="221" REF="030609_0220_0FE82F51ED54D7D8">
his infinite wi&s;dom and love, in all his coun|&s;els, and in all his works. "What I do thou knowe&s;t not now, but thou &s;halt know hereafter." "In the latter end ye &s;hall con|&s;ider it perfectly."</P>
<P>THERE have been, no doubt, many godly per&s;ons that never could endure the doctrine of the divine decrees, in the <HI>limitarian</HI> &s;en&s;e. The hearts of good people do not reject the ab&s;olute prede&s;tination and decrees of God, nor ever did, &s;imply con&s;idered, or ju&s;tly con&s;idered. What our hearts revolt at, is the attributing &s;uch decrees to God, as are contrary to his nature. "GOD IS LOVE." Attribute no decrees to God but tho&s;e of in|finite love, in harmony with all the perfecti|ons of Deity, and they will &s;et ea&s;y on our minds. Charge him with no decrees that are contrary to his nature, and they will all appear beautiful. But, when we conceive of a God exhibiting a nature and di&s;po&s;ition oppo&s;ite to that of the great JEHOVAH; a God of &s;ome love and of great malevolence; and then conceive of &s;uch decrees as &s;uch a God would make, our hearts &s;hudder at them. But decrees flowing from the true nature of the living and true God, are all lovely. All our hopes of happine&s;s are founded on the nature, attributes, and &s;overeign will of the living and true God. His infinitely good di&s;po&s;ition &s;ecures us. His paternal love and goodne&s;s makes us &s;afe; as all his natu|ral perfections are exerted under the direc|tion of his wi&s;dom and love.</P>

name the &s;uppo&s;ition, that JEHOVAH was in all things el&s;e as he now is; but only had a di&s;po&s;ition to infinite malevolence, as he now hath to infinite love and benevolence; poor &s;uffering creatures could not even then im|peach his ju&s;tice, &s;imply con&s;idered: For their whole beings, and all the comfort, and all the pain that could ever affect them, would be God's own ab&s;olute property, to di&s;po&s;e of, as he plea&s;ed. Their very feel|ings, of every kind and degree would be his ab&s;olute property; &s;ince their whole being is &s;o. But, alas! he would certainly act out his di&s;po&s;ition, and propagate mi&s;ery far and wide, and that to all eternity. My reader, is this your God? Have you learned that he hath indeed &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition of heart, from his works or from his word? Is this the Son of God that you have heard and thought &s;o much about, that &s;o loved the world as to die for the &s;ins of the whole world? Have you &s;o learned Chri&s;t? To di&s;pute of <HI>meum</HI> and <HI>tuum, mine and thine,</HI> with Deity is utterly ab&s;urd; but to hope and tru&s;t in the nature, attributes, will and word of &s;uch an infinitely good &s;overeign, through the atonement of his own dear Son, is un&s;peakably comfortable to mi&s;erable, dying &s;inners.</P>
<P>WE are taught, in the word of God, that all our backwardne&s;s in believing to the &s;al|vation of our &s;ouls, lies in the enmity of our hearts; at lea&s;t, that if this was all re|moved, we &s;hould, under go&s;pel light, rea|dily

believe. The under&s;tanding, and all the powers of our &s;ouls would act in a &s;aving manner towards God and Chri&s;t, if the tem|per and di&s;po&s;ition of our &s;ouls were right. This is certainly true. But our hearts are exceedingly oppo&s;ed to God who is love. Therefore, until this enmity is removed, we cannot believe the doctrines of God's &s;ove|reign, &s;elf-moved love, pity, mercy, to &s;uch horrible &s;inners as we are.</P>
<P>WHEN we hear the pure doctrines of free grace, our hearts &s;ay, "this is too good news to be true." Mankind, in a &s;tate of nature, find no &s;uch di&s;po&s;ition in them&s;elves, nor in other men like them&s;elves; and they do, and will imagine that God is, in this regard, "altogether &s;uch an one as them&s;elves:" and &s;o cannot believe there is any &s;uch &s;elf-mov|ed love and mercy in God. They cannot forgive their enemies before they repent, and reform, and become their friends, and make all the re&s;titution in their power; and hard|ly then. They will maintain &s;ome grudge after all. Therefore, they will not believe "that while they were yet enemies, in due time, Chri&s;t died for them," and paid their whole debt, while they were in all their en|mity again&s;t God: And ju&s;tified them, as to the law of God, while they were ungodly working not in any manner acceptable to God, but wholly in enmity again&s;t him: And that "being ju&s;tified by his death, they &s;hall much more be &s;aved by his life&punc;" i. e. By his almighty all gracious mediation, ap|plying the benefit of purcha&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> and
<PB N="224" REF="030609_0223_0FE82F59F7C413C8">
&s;alvation, by giving them repentance, faith, holine&s;s, and fulfilling in them all the con|ditions, in his own way and time. They cannot believe, that "God hath exalted him a Prince and a Savior, to <HI>give repen|tance</HI> as well as remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins:" That "he that &s;pared not his own Son, but freely delivered him up for <HI>us all,</HI> all &s;inners, will much more with him freely give them all things." They have no &s;uch di&s;po&s;ition them&s;elves; but quite the rever&s;e: and they cannot believe that God has, when he &s;ays, "I, even I, am he that blotteth out your &s;in for mine own &s;ake." They cannot re|ceive this &s;aying; becau&s;e, all they know of the temper of their own hearts, and of other men is directly oppo&s;ite to &s;uch free love and &s;elf-moved mercy.</P>
<P>A SENSE of divine love, or charity, is ne|ver impre&s;&s;ed on the hearts of &s;inful men, but in an almighty work of regeneration, making them feel, in &s;ome degree, the &s;ame temper and &s;pirit. When they can forgive their mo&s;t malicious enemies, and love them, and &s;incerely wi&s;h them all good, and pray for them, before they become any better, or a&s;k any pardon at all, as Chri&s;t did, and as Stephen did; then they can be|lieve that there is &s;uch an heart in God as his word does te&s;tify.</P>
<P>A YOUNG man that has been brought up in the family of a nobleman of va&s;t wealth, who has always been a great benefactor to him, and whom he always loved mo&s;t &s;in|cerely, and &s;erved mo&s;t faithfully, giving
<PB N="225" REF="030609_0224_0FE82F6058EE9568">
every te&s;timony of love, fidelity and obedi|ence, during his minority; well knowing that his benefactor always had the kinde&s;t &s;en&s;e of his filial love, duty, and obedience, will, when he comes of age, ea&s;ily believe the report, if it be told him, that the noble|man has given him a valuable legacy, in his la&s;t will and te&s;tament. But, a young man that was under the like advantages, who yet always hated his benefactor, rebelled a|gain&s;t him continually, mocked him every day, reviled him in all his conver&s;ation, did all he could to kill him more than a thou|&s;and times, and finally purloined all his goods that he could lay hands on, and ran away from him, and continues to hate him wor&s;e than ever; would by no means believe the report, &s;hould the &s;tory pa&s;s, that the &s;aid nobleman had given him a fine e&s;tate. His own &s;en&s;e of guilt, enmity, and ingrati|tude, would repel any idea that the news could be true. Ju&s;t &s;o, the glorious te&s;ti|monials of God's infinitely free love and mercy, come to &s;inful men. The ble&s;&s;ed go&s;pel is oppo&s;ed by them, on every ground and motive of enmity and unbelief, which can ari&s;e from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the utmo&s;t di&s;affection in their hearts to an holy God, and the mo&s;t awful rebellion of their whole lives again&s;t him.</P>
<P>THIS doctrine of infinite, univer&s;al, &s;ove|reign grace, flowing wholly out of the na|ture and di&s;po&s;ition of God to mankind, is
<PB N="226" REF="030609_0225_0FE82EC69F3DE8D8">
wholly con&s;i&s;tent with his rewarding every man according to his works; and is the on|ly doctrine of &s;alvation that is &s;o.</P>
<P>THE <HI>limitarians</HI> them&s;elves, have always under&s;tood this doctrine as relating, not on|ly to the different degrees of happine&s;s a|mong the &s;aved, and the different degrees of mi&s;ery among the damned; but al&s;o <HI>princi|pally</HI> to the great difference in the eternal world, between all who are &s;aved, and all who are damned: Each de&s;cription being compared with the other, or the &s;aved com|pared with the damned. And this is cer|tainly the true go&s;pel &s;en&s;e of the declara|tion, &s;o frequent in the word of God. But then we ought to under&s;tand the word of God aright, as to the true meaning of <HI>&s;alva|tion</HI> and <HI>damnation.</HI> Which cannot be, in any other &s;en&s;e than what I plead for, con|&s;i&s;tent with that proportion of reward which is a&s;&s;erted.</P>
<P>NO <HI>limitarian</HI> on earth will pre&s;ume to &s;ay, that believers in this world are as much better than other &s;inners, as heaven is better than hell: Or that there is, or ever was, &s;o great a difference in moral character, between any two men on earth, as there is between heaven and hell. There is not a man on earth, nor ever was &s;ince the fall, that can ju&s;tly claim a better character than that of a <HI>believing, penitent, abominable &s;inner.</HI> We do not &s;uppo&s;e that the be&s;t on earth have got half way from the wor&s;t character they ever had, before conver&s;ion, to that character which &s;aints in heaven &s;u&s;tain. It is certain
<PB N="227" REF="030609_0226_0FE82F61E080A208">
that Job, David, and Paul, did not think they had. "I abhor my&s;elf, and repent in du&s;tland a&s;hes." "There is no &s;oundne&s;s in my fle&s;h, becau&s;e of thine anger, neither is there any re&s;t in my bones, becau&s;e of my &s;in." "My wounds &s;tink and are corrupt becau&s;e of my fooli&s;hne&s;s." "I am carnal &s;old under &s;in." "O wretched man that I am, who &s;hall deliver me from the body of this death!" "Not as though I had already attain|ed, either were already perfect." Thus &s;pake the&s;e men, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the mo&s;t eminent attainments in this world; and that without any compliment at all. They &s;pake the truth, as they felt the real weight of it in their own &s;ouls. The&s;e are true &s;pecimens of the be&s;t men, and be&s;t moral characters that ever were, or will be, on this &s;ide death. Now let the&s;e three men go into the infinite and everla&s;ting joys of heaven, (and no doubt they are there) and contra&s;t with them the three vile&s;t mo|ral characters, that ever exi&s;ted &s;ince the world began, gone away into the infinite and endle&s;s torments of hell, in the <HI>limitari|an</HI> &s;en&s;e; and then &s;ay, my reader, is there not a greater difference between the reward of the&s;e, than there was between their works in this world? All may be in heaven, and yet the difference of reward be as great there as that of character here. In no other po&s;&s;i|ble way can the proportion take place accord|ing to &s;cripture.</P>
<P>IF believers, in this life, were as holy as they are in heaven, and unbelievers altogeth|er as bad as the devil: yet even then, there
<PB N="228" REF="030609_0227_0FE82F68449BFE20">
would be no proportion of reward to their works, on the <HI>limitarian</HI> plan, unle&s;s they had been one eternity <HI>a parte ante</HI> (as the lan|guage of the &s;chools is) before they went in|to another eternity <HI>a parte po&s;t.</HI> The time of works, or of exhibiting a moral character in this life, bears no proportion to eternity. Duration, or long continuance in good or bad works, no doubt, hath its due con&s;ide|ration in the reward; but temporal, momen|tary works bear no proportion to an eternal reward either of happine&s;s or mi&s;ery. Do not mi&s;under&s;tand me here. I mean not in the lea&s;t, to countenance the idle notion of tho&s;e who &s;ay, "becau&s;e &s;in is but tempora|ry in this world; therefore it is not &s;trictly ju&s;t that its puni&s;hment &s;hould be eternal." I have before exploded this idea. I am now &s;peaking only of the <HI>proportion</HI> mentioned in the go&s;pel, between the rewards of mankind in a future &s;tate; not of the ju&s;t demerit of &s;in. I &s;ay, it &s;eems exceeding plain, on the <HI>limitarian</HI> plan, there can be no proportion at all between the rewards of the elect, and reprobate, as mea&s;ured by their different works in this life. All in them&s;elves de&s;erve an eternal hell&punc; no doubt; but God has been graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to a&s;&s;ure us, that the &s;tate of each man in the world to come, &s;hall be in proportion to his works here. This never can be, if &s;ome great &s;inners, who &s;inned all their lives here, yet believing &s;inners, are in the next life con&s;ummately and eternally happy; and other poor, mi&s;erable &s;inners, that is, unbelieving &s;inners, are made con|&s;ummately
<PB N="229" REF="030609_0228_0FE82F69CC238370">
and eternally mi&s;erable. Both de&s;erve it. But we are now availing our|&s;elves of God's own declaration of &s;overeign goodne&s;s in the go&s;pel. I know, and I have already &s;aid it again and again; that the law thunders eternal, certain damnation to &s;inners, and it is the awful voice of ju&s;tice throughout the &s;acred oracles from begin|ning to end; but there is not one word of go&s;pel, glad tidings, or good news to &s;inners in all this: It is all law, <HI>pure law,</HI> glorious law, denouncing what, <HI>in pure ju&s;tice,</HI> ought to be. There is not a &s;ingle word of the go&s;pel in the whole of this, in all the&s;e dread|ful thunders. The go&s;pel mildly and &s;weetly announces that all the&s;e dreadful things have taken place in Chri&s;t, the <HI>head of every man.</HI> And now he hath full power and commi&s;&s;ion to apply his own redemption, to all tho&s;e of whom he is the head, and for whom he died; and that in his own time and way.</P>
<P>WE all know there will be different re|wards in heaven, according to different cha|racters and works in this life. None will be rewarded <HI>for their works;</HI> but <HI>according to them.</HI> It will be &s;o with all mankind that ever lived or &s;hall live. They will, every one of them, bear a proportion to each other, <HI>as to their &s;tate in the eternal world,</HI> as they did in their <HI>re&s;pective characters and works</HI> here. This never can be, without the univer&s;al tri|umph of Chri&s;t over &s;in, death and hell, and all the condemning power of the holy law, in ta&s;ting death for every man. We could ea&s;ily &s;ee all this to be the true &s;pirit of the
<PB N="230" REF="030609_0229_0FE82F7037C30640">
go&s;pel; if we only knew and felt within our own &s;ouls, that the great PARENT of the univer&s;e, as much exceeds any human pa|rent, in love to his offspring, as he is a grea|ter being than man; and that this is the real nature of God.</P>
<P>THIS ble&s;&s;ed, go&s;pel doctrine gives us an admiring view of the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of God, in the appointment and ordination of his civil mini&s;ters in the pre&s;ent world, to make this life tolerable, by the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of vice and immorality: E&s;pecially as &s;e|cure, hardened &s;inners are not at all re&s;train|ed by the threatnings of eternal damnation, even though they deny not the awful doc|trines they hear; but allude to the truth of them, by mo&s;t profane and horrid impre|cations, in their common conver&s;ation. Pre|&s;ent, vi&s;ible puni&s;hments &s;trike them with dread, and greatly re&s;train them. A fine, a pri&s;on, a whip, and a gibbet have great in|fluence to &s;uppre&s;s their enormities.</P>
<P>GOD has, in his infinite wi&s;dom and good|ne&s;s, appointed his civil mini&s;ters for good. The&s;e powers are ordained of God, for this great and benevolent purpo&s;e, to be a terror to evil doers, and the &s;upporters of tho&s;e that do well. It will give an exalted &s;en&s;e of God to tho&s;e that know his &s;alvation, to &s;ee all tho&s;e mini&s;ters he has ordained for the good of mankind, executing their re&s;pec|tive offices well, for the glory of his great name and the good of human &s;ociety, in puni&s;hing all tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors with the utmo&s;t faithfulne&s;s and impartiality, according to
<PB N="231" REF="030609_0230_0FE82F0879C12BE8">
good and whole&s;ome laws; and in encoura|ging all the virtuous and regular in the com|munity. We ought to rejoice that they who do all in their power to make their fellow|men happy, &s;hould partake largely of that good, which they &s;o much &s;trive to promote and communicate; and that they, who war again&s;t the happine&s;s of mankind, &s;hould feel in a proper degree, that mi&s;ery, which, by their wickedne&s;s, they would bring upon all. God's glorious decrees of &s;overeign, rich, &s;elf-moved mercy to them at la&s;t, do not in the lea&s;t, excu&s;e them from the due reward of their deeds here; no, nor even tho&s;e that have already believed to the &s;aving of their &s;ouls, when they back&s;lide and do the deeds of the wicked.</P>
<P>THERE are a great variety of ju&s;t and ter|rible puni&s;hments from the hand of God's civil mini&s;ters, that do, and ought to meet and oppo&s;e flagrant tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, in all their open wickedne&s;s in this world. Tho&s;e in|deed have their vi&s;ible and &s;en&s;ible effect. The &s;courge and the gibbet are very terrible to tho&s;e that are wholly unmoved by every con&s;ideration which does not apply to their &s;en&s;es: And how wretched are daring &s;in|ners in this world, by the ju&s;t rebukes of heaven in this way! While they are harden|ed in vice, all con&s;olation ari&s;ing from the final mercy of God is wholly &s;hut out of their &s;ouls, ju&s;t as much on the plan I plead for, as on any more limited doctrine whatever. The mo&s;t glorious truth, without an heart-felt conviction of it, can give no
<PB N="232" REF="030609_0231_0FE82EB09DF4ABB0">
comfort. The&s;e poor, mi&s;erable creatures are ju&s;t as we have been wont to &s;ay the elect are, antecedent to their conver&s;ion; not at all the more comfortable for their election, until they are brought to know the things freely given them of God. How mi&s;erable in this life, are thieves, drunkards, traitors, murderers, and &s;uch like! Every good law, and every good magi&s;trate, and all good peo|ple oppo&s;e them with all their might, with one awful puni&s;hment after another, until many of them end their lives of fear, tremb|ling and horror on a gibbet, awful &s;pectacles of &s;hame and reproach, and without any comfort in their own &s;ouls, from the ble&s;&s;ed truth I maintain. For it will fully appear, that no man of the vile character I have been de&s;cribing, while with &s;uch an heart, can de|rive any comfort from this plan of &s;alvation; any more than any of the elect of God, on any &s;uppo&s;ition whatever, could have in|ward divine con&s;olation, while in a &s;tate of nature, of unbelief, and utter impenitency. I &s;ay, how mi&s;erable are &s;uch poor creatures in this world! How full of &s;hame and horror, when taken away by the arm of ju&s;tice! And why &s;hould we grudge them the mercy and pity of the Father of their &s;pirits, on who&s;e &s;overeign grace alone we our&s;elves are de|pendent for better conduct&punc; and better cir|cum&s;tances in this life; if he is plea&s;ed, in his infinite goodne&s;s, through the all-&s;uffici|ent atonement of him who died, not for our &s;ins only, but al&s;o for the &s;ins of the whole world, to give relief, everla&s;ting relief, to
<PB N="233" REF="030609_0232_0FE82EF23850F630">
the&s;e poor, trembling &s;pirits, his own off|&s;pring at la&s;t, even at the time when the &s;oul, with infinite angui&s;h and the mo&s;t hor|rible expectations, is &s;eparating from that body, from a union with which, it deriv|ed all its awful depravity.</P>
<P>IF we have been more favoured in this life, by the &s;overeign, di&s;tingui&s;hing good|ne&s;s of the common Parent of all, let us be exceeding thankful. We &s;hould do well to remember, that, con&s;idering all the &s;uperior degrees of God's free grace granted to us, again&s;t which we have al&s;o &s;inned every day, and every moment, we may be as guilty in the &s;ight of God, as our poor unhappy brethren, that never have been ble&s;&s;ed with that prudent fore&s;ight, and tho&s;e re&s;traints wherewith God has been plea&s;ed to favor us. We may well acquie&s;ce in all the di&s;plays of divine ju&s;tice which we &s;ee in this world, even in tho&s;e that are condemned to flee to the pit, and our hand &s;hould not &s;tay them. But, I think, we can give no rea&s;on why the blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which <HI>clean&s;eth from all &s;in,</HI> &s;hould not &s;ave them in another world; which will not lie <HI>full &s;trong</HI> again&s;t every hope of our own &s;alvation. If their &s;ins go beforehand to judgment, ours may follow after. An earthly tribunal affords but a mi&s;erable deci&s;ion to determine who are deepe&s;t in guilt, in the eye of the Omni&s;ci|ent Judge.</P>
<P>WE have exceeding &s;trong motives to reli|gion and all moral virtue, drawn from views
<PB N="234" REF="030609_0233_0FE82F71C3DCFBB0">
of honor and pro&s;perity, plea&s;ure and joy in this life; and to deter us from the ways of wickedne&s;s, from the oppo&s;ite con&s;idera|tion. <HI>Caeteris paribus,</HI> a man is always happy in this world, in proportion to that degree of true godline&s;s and virtue which forms his real character; and mi&s;erable in proportion to the degree of wickedne&s;s that governs him. Al&s;o great, very great will be the di&s;tinction between &s;uch different characters to all eternity. Their reward will be as different, as their works have been. And this may be; yet both of them be in the &s;ame world there, as well as here. No man in this world, &s;ince the fall, ever had any heart but a bad one, <HI>really and truly &s;o.</HI> "There is none good but one, that is God." No man ever did one good deed, in the &s;trict &s;en&s;e of the divine law. "They are all gone out of the way; there is none that doeth good, no not one."</P>
<P>WHEN we &s;peak of the good heart of be|lievers, and of their good and holy lives; and when we find the&s;e epithets in &s;cripture, they are never to be under&s;tood in <HI>&s;trict pro|priety of &s;peech,</HI> but only in a <HI>comparative &s;en&s;e,</HI> i. e. <HI>le&s;s wicked,</HI> in the exerci&s;es of their hearts, as to the real matter of the&s;e ex|erci&s;es, than unbelievers are, or than they them&s;elves were, in a &s;tate of unregeneracy. It is the &s;ame with regard to their good and holy lives: i. e. they are <HI>much le&s;s wicked,</HI> as to the matter of their conduct, than once they were, or than unbelievers ordinarily are.

<HI>&s;trictne&s;s</HI> of &s;peech, no po&s;itive goodne&s;s be|longs to any human character on earth; nor can this po&s;&s;ibly obtain, unle&s;s &s;omething be found as pure in all re&s;pects as the law of God, which is the only mea&s;ure of po&s;itive moral goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>IN real propriety of language, all men are great &s;inners without exception, and &s;ome, as to the matter of their character and conduct, much greater &s;inners than others. I &s;ay, <HI>as to the matter;</HI> for I &s;hall con&s;ider obligations, motives, aggravations, &amp;c. in the &s;equel. But in this all men on earth do now, and ever did agree, viz. "<HI>the heart and character of every man, in the &s;ight of God, is an awful, un&s;peakably bad heart and charac|ter.</HI>" And there will be no reward to any in the next world, but a reward of free, &s;o|vereign grace, through the atonement and mediation of God's elect Savior, the elect head of every man. All may be in heaven together in God's own time, brought there in his own way, with as great a di&s;tinction of reward <HI>there,</HI> as of character here.

righteou&s;ne&s;s, as the character and works of tho&s;e who never heard of a Savior.

There is no difference, none at all, but what exi&s;ts while the medium of faith and the means of application are &s;u&s;pended: None as to the covenant of redemption: None as to the undertaking of Chri&s;t: None with regard to the purcha&s;e or faithfulne&s;s and promi&s;e of him, who came into the world, not to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be &s;aved: None as to merit on the part of man, or any motion towards God in the heart of one man more than another: None, as to the eternal good purpo&s;e of God: In this, and every other &s;en&s;e he is no re&s;pecter of per&s;ons. The language of a God of infinite, &s;overeign mercy, to his children partakers of fle&s;h and blood, and for the &s;ake of union with whom, his own Son took part of the &s;ame, is this, without any di&s;tinction; "I, even I am he that blotteth out your &s;in, for mine own &s;ake."</P>
<P>VERILY there are all the di&s;tinctions a|mong mankind, in this, and a future world, which the holy &s;criptures know any thing of, without our making any di&s;tinction, in|vented by the blindne&s;s of the human mind, and the great want of benevolence that is natural to man. Pride, and love of pre|eminence which is &s;o dear to human nature,

will not let us re&s;t ea&s;y, but in a &s;elf-exalt|ing pro&s;pect that a very few of us &s;hall have the plea&s;ure, in the next world, to look down on the great body of mankind infinite|ly beneath us, and feeling our own happine&s;s much heightened, and our own glory much augmented, by the contra&s;t of their extreme mi&s;ery and &s;hame. Do you feel this &s;pirit, my reader? You had need take care, le&s;t, on your plan of limiting the Holy One of I&s;rael, your&s;elf may take the inferior rank among tho&s;e, whom you now view in pro&s;|pect with a future unutterable contempt.</P>
<P>WHATEVER difference, or <HI>&s;pecific diffe|rence,</HI> if any prefer the&s;e terms, there may be between the grace given to one and another, in this life, the character, temper and ways of all the human race agree in many things more than they differ! "As in water face an&s;wereth to face, &s;o doth the heart of man to man." Bring all the human race together, and their di&s;&s;imilitude will be very &s;mall, in compari&s;on of their general agreement. A pre&s;ent believer hath indeed &s;omething, which a pre&s;ent unbeliever hath not; and God knows what a <HI>little &s;omething</HI> it is. His omni&s;cient eye &s;ees how awfully we all a|gree. He never yet &s;aw a rea&s;on, or found a motive <HI>out of him&s;elf,</HI> to &s;ave any of us all. Had all mankind right thoughts of God, a real true knowledge of that glorious fountain of love, this would make &s;alvation appear <HI>common &s;alvation,</HI> as it did of old. Jude iii. And none would deny it, or even &s;o much as wi&s;h the doctrine were not true. If that
<PB N="238" REF="030609_0237_0FE82F801B7B9178">
knowledge of God, which all men are com|manded to &s;eek after above all things, would e&s;tabli&s;h us in this ble&s;&s;ed truth, is not the foundation of it real, &s;olid, and true? Or does our di&s;covery and knowledge of things &s;o glorious, give being to their own objects?</P>
<P>IF mankind were wi&s;e enough to know in what way to find their greate&s;t intere&s;t, joy, plea&s;ure, and delight, even in this pre&s;ent life, they would certainly &s;eek it and find it only in the ways of real piety and virtue, in the ways of true wi&s;dom. "Her ways are ways of plea&s;antne&s;s, and all her paths are peace. She is a tree of life to all that lay hold on her; and happy is every one that retaineth her." All the happine&s;s of heaven con&s;i&s;ts in true religion, in the highe&s;t perfection of it. If it is not happine&s;s as far as we have it, in the pre&s;ent world, it will not be in a future: For the nature of it is the very &s;ame, in whatever part of God's va&s;t dominions we are. The nature, tenden|cy, and concomitants of &s;in are ju&s;t the re|ver&s;e. If &s;in is happifying in this world, it will be in the next; if it gives real joy and plea&s;ure here, it will there. The hell that the devils are in, and that all mankind de&s;erve, and are condemned to, by the law of God, is nothing but perfection of &s;in, with its in&s;eparable connections and con&s;e|quences. The&s;e remarks being admitted, we are prepared to re&s;ume the thought before &s;ugge&s;ted; comparing one &s;inner of the hu|mankind with another. I have intimated
<PB N="239" REF="030609_0238_0FE82EFA21909338">
that there is a va&s;t difference, in many <HI>re&s;|pects,</HI> and yet in <HI>one grand re&s;pect</HI> none at all.</P>
<P>WITH regard to this pre&s;ent life, and our connection with human &s;ociety; and with re&s;pect to our own comfort or mi&s;ery here, there is very great difference between tho&s;e we call the be&s;t, and the wor&s;t of men. The former do much good, and inwardly feel much comfort and real, &s;olid plea&s;ure; and are, in the general cour&s;e of the divine go|vernment, of all men mo&s;t beloved, honor|ed, and promoted. I &s;ay, <HI>in the general cour&s;e of providence;</HI> for &s;pecial times of per|&s;ecution and the like, I now leave out of the que&s;tion. In &s;aying this, I &s;ay ju&s;t what the word of God, in the general tenor of it, abundantly a&s;&s;erts, and what the general ex|perience of all nations of the earth does a|bundantly confirm.</P>
<P>EVEN, in days of the mo&s;t bloody per&s;e|cution, the real happine&s;s and joy of the godly is much greater than that of any other men. Whatever a blind, carnal world may imagine, there is in very deed a great, and mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed reward of holine&s;s and piety, in the pre&s;ent life. "Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, who&s;e mind is &s;tayed on thee; becau&s;e he tru&s;teth in thee." "In keeping thy commandments there is great reward." "And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good?" "If ye obey and &s;erve him, ye &s;hall &s;pend your days in pro&s;perity, and your years in plea|&s;ure." No outward circum&s;tances, or ad|ver&s;e di&s;pen&s;ations can po&s;&s;ibly fru&s;trate this
<PB N="240" REF="030609_0239_0FE82E697B4AF098">
exceeding, real, inward delight and joy in the mind, in the &s;oul, the &s;eat of all ration|al and &s;piritual plea&s;ure. "As &s;orrowful, yet always rejoicing: As having nothing, yet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing all things." The real, &s;ub&s;tan|tial, &s;olid plea&s;ures of believing, godly &s;ouls, have a ba&s;is very different from all the emo|tions of the hearts of God's enemies, which deluded &s;ouls call plea&s;ure. They are al|ways "like the troubled &s;ea, which cannot re&s;t, who&s;e waters ca&s;t up mire and dirt." Whatever fal&s;e &s;hew of happine&s;s they may make, in the eyes of the world, yet "there is no peace, &s;aith God, to the wicked." There is truly as great a difference in the real, in|ward reward of the virtuous and vicious, the godly and ungodly, in this life, as there is in the different temper of their minds, and in the different ways in which they walk.</P>
<P>BUT now let us compare their de&s;ert of puni&s;hment, in another world, <HI>&s;olely as it re&s;|pects the law of God,</HI> the great and only un|erring and deci&s;ive rule. We all agree in the following ratio of e&s;timating the deme|rit of &s;in in the &s;ight of God. We con&s;i|der the matter of it as one thing, i.e. how far our hearts and lives deviate from the law of God; and the obligations again&s;t which we &s;in, as another. We compare the&s;e two together, and thence judge of the real cri|minality of a &s;inner in the &s;ight of God. This is agreeable to rea&s;on and the word of God.</P>
<P>LET us &s;et up two men, and try their guilt in the &s;ight of God, or in the eye of
<PB N="241" REF="030609_0240_0FE82E70C60C9D50">
his holy law, by the above rule. Pharaoh &s;hall be one, and Paul the other. The for|mer was a mo&s;t horrible &s;inner, in the eyes of all good people; the latter was one of the be&s;t of men, in the &s;ame view. Pharaoh did all the harm in his power, and his whole heart was in it. Paul, after his conver&s;ion; did much good, with a &s;incere and pious heart. Thus far the difference of character is exceeding great, while we attend only to the matter of it. Next bring in the obliga|tions. Pharaoh was, perhaps, lea&s;t of all mankind favored with tenderne&s;s of con&s;ci|ence, or re&s;training grace. He was in all the gro&s;s darkne&s;s of pagani&s;m, and God did indeed harden his heart, in a mo&s;t &s;ignal manner, and that in a way con&s;i&s;tent with his own holine&s;s and purity. It is here quite foreign to the argument, to enquire in|to the manner how. Whether only by per|mi&s;&s;ion, or otherwi&s;e, it is certain God did it. He was left under the lea&s;t obligations and motives to keep him from &s;in, we will &s;up|po&s;e, of any man that ever lived; and we will al&s;o &s;uppo&s;e, and grant, that the matter of his &s;in, in heart and life, was the greate&s;t of any man on earth. Paul, after his con|ver&s;ion, was ble&s;&s;ed with the greate&s;t divine light (we will &s;uppo&s;e) of any man on earth. His natural powers and education were ex|ceeding good, with mo&s;t eminent degrees of &s;aving grace in his &s;oul, abundance of &s;anc|tifying grace, and an equal degree of divine joy and con&s;olation. And he &s;erved God
<PB N="242" REF="030609_0241_0FE82F20C280ABB8">
in a mo&s;t eminent manner. Yet he always &s;inned in &s;ome degree, in his heart and in his life; he was never perfect one &s;ingle mo|ment; far, very far from it, if we may be|lieve his own in&s;pired te&s;timony of him&s;elf.</P>
<P>NOW, did not Paul's obligations and mo|tives to holine&s;s, as far exceed Pharaoh's, as the matter of his character was better? What made him better, but his motives and obligations, ari&s;ing from the light, grace, and &s;pirit, freely given him of God? Yet his character was always very inadequate to the purity of God's holy law. All that made him le&s;s &s;inful in heart, and life, was mere obligation from God. All light and grace, and every thing that hath this effect, is &s;o. Multiply the degree of his remaining &s;in|fulne&s;s, as to the matter of it, into the de|gree of obligation and motive to which it was oppo&s;ed, and what le&s;s will be the total amount, in the &s;ight of God, than that of Pharaoh? This abominable prince had ob|ligations, again&s;t which he &s;inned, many and great; as every man in the world has. But compare them with all that a &s;overeign God did for the apo&s;tle, all his light and grace; the difference is exceeding great. God did as much more for Paul, as his heart and life were better than Pharaoh's. All he did for that eminent apo&s;tle was mere obligation on him, and the law ju&s;tly required perfection of him: But he was al|ways very far from it. Obligations on Pha|raoh, i. e. light and grace, were as far with|held from him, by a holy &s;overeign God, as
<PB N="243" REF="030609_0242_0FE7EC3694381620">
his heart and life was more &s;inful than that of Paul. Perhaps my reader has not much attended to this thought in time pa&s;t; but I think it worthy of &s;olemn attention, I am &s;ure it runs through the whole word of God. This will account for tho&s;e mo&s;t abominable de&s;criptions, which Job, David and Paul give of them&s;elves, even in their highe&s;t attain|ments in grace, and after all their pious walk with God, and all the great good they had done in the world.</P>
<P>DESCRIPTIONS of this tenor, which the be&s;t of men give of their hearts and lives in holy writ, and which I have always heard the mo&s;t eminent chri&s;tians give of them|&s;elves, in their &s;olemn and devout prayers, were &s;urprizing to me, in the days of my early youth. I once under&s;tood them as humble and meek compliments, which they were di&s;po&s;ed to make to the Deity, or ex|pre&s;&s;ions entirely hyperbolical. When I &s;o often heard the mo&s;t godly mini&s;ters and other eminent chri&s;tians de&s;cribe their hearts and lives, in the pre&s;ence of God, had enough for the vile&s;t, and mo&s;t notorious &s;inners in the world, I u&s;ed to, wonder how they dared thus to compliment with an heart-&s;earching God, who, I &s;uppo&s;ed, mu&s;t know they did not &s;peak the &s;trict truth, and that they knew it them&s;elves. I did not &s;o much wonder to hear a rich man own his poverty; or a delicate lady de&s;pi&s;e a fine entertain|ment, an excellent dinner, or &s;upper &s;he had provided, in the pre&s;ence of her gue&s;ts. Such compliments I thought might bear
<PB N="244" REF="030609_0243_0FE82F224B069220">
having countenance from frequent cu&s;tom, and an appearance of humility and deli|cacy. But, I thought it quite ami&s;s to &s;ay that to the great, heart-&s;earching God, which both the &s;peaker and the object of prayer knew was far from &s;trict and plain truth.</P>
<P>AFTER long attention to the law of God, and the hearts and lives of men, and the ob|ligations we are under to God, very e&s;peci|ally for every degree of divine light and &s;av|ing grace; I am at la&s;t very &s;en&s;ible of the propriety of all &s;uch confe&s;&s;ions before God, and that they are wholly without a compli|ment. The phari&s;ee in the parable was, no doubt, a man of pure and amiable character in the eyes of the world, and de&s;erved great honor and re&s;pect from man, for the good he had done in the community, by his &s;hining virtues. But, when he was tran&s;acting the great concerns of his &s;oul with his Maker, he might have prayed ju&s;t as the &s;candalous, infamous publican did, and with good acceptance too.</P>
<P>LET beneficent, &s;hining characters, the eminent benefactors of mankind receive great honor and re&s;pect from their fellow-men. Let them &s;tand far di&s;tingui&s;hed from the common people, and farther &s;till from all the vicious and immoral: But as they &s;tand related to that holy law which con&s;iders ev|ery obligation men are under to perfect holine&s;s, as well as the matter of their con|duct, I &s;ay, in this view, &s;et every high thought and towring imagination be levelled with the du&s;t. Let every mountain and hill
<PB N="245" REF="030609_0244_0FE82E724DC43B20">
be brought down, and the Lord alone exalt|ed.</P>
<P>MANKIND have a &s;pirit of monopoly. Nothing is more natural to them. If they have great advantages and honors in the eyes of others in this world, they are apt to in&s;i&s;t on tho&s;e di&s;tinctions before God, as an argu|ment for eternal continuance. But, "the la&s;t &s;hall be fir&s;t, and the fir&s;t &s;hall be la&s;t."</P>
<P>THAT which is highly e&s;teemed among men, ever all that men call good, in the human character, is &s;o far from, bearing the te&s;t of God's holy law, that it is, in that relative &s;en&s;e, abomination in the &s;ight of God. Let the be&s;t man on earth plead the be&s;t of his heart and his life, as a ground of acceptance with God; and he &s;hall find it an utter abo|mination. The atonement &s;tands by it&s;elf alone and unmixed: "The Lion of the tribe of Judah, the root and offspring of David, and he alone hath prevailed." This glori|ous truth hath ever been deeply impre&s;&s;ed on the hearts of the friends of God, in this world, and will be to all eternity. The blind, proud notions of mankind will have no place in heaven, as they have here. There they will know and feel that "the former things are pa&s;&s;ed away."</P>
<P>THE doctrine which I plead for, has a great tendency to afford believers adoring and &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ive exerci&s;es of mind, in view of all the &s;in and calamity they find in the world.</P>
<P>THEY &s;ee that God has done nothing in|con&s;i&s;tent

with his infinite love, and his a|vowed character in his word, by introducing, in his holy providence, or permitting, if you plea&s;e, all the moral evil that is in the world. It will all have a glorious i&s;&s;ue, conducive to the greater manife&s;tation of his infinite love, and all his amiable attributes, in the wonders of redeeming love. And in a view of all na|tural and penal evil connected in ju&s;tice with the evil of &s;in, the &s;oul adores God and falls in lowly &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion under all his holy rebukes. So, when we &s;ee &s;o many mi&s;erable creatures of our own kind &s;truggling with pain and ca|lamity, through life, we behold them as Je|&s;us does, who died to &s;ave them from wrath to come; and our &s;ouls are filled with hum|ble &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and all the a&s;toni&s;hment of devout love.</P>
<P>WHEN we read of all the dreadful &s;laugh|ters of the ancient inhabitants of the land of Canaan, and many millions more of God's own offspring like our&s;elves, under all the horrors of ma&s;&s;acre, by the expre&s;s command of the Father of their &s;pirits, we &s;hall yet &s;ay "God is love." He hath, in all the&s;e things given a due te&s;timony of his ju&s;tice, and his abhorrence of &s;in. Yet it is not "the rod of an enemy, or the cha&s;ti&s;ement of a cruel one:" God hath not forgotten that he is their own Father, by creation, and that creation is a dear child of his love. On this plan, we do not &s;tumble at any thing he does; but feel the&s;e his words with believing joy, "as I live, &s;aith the Lord, I have no plea&s;ure in the death of him that dieth." When we
<PB N="247" REF="030609_0246_0FE82E78DE1EDC78">
think of all the awful and terrible judgments that have fallen on the trembling children of men, our own fle&s;h and blood, it is well for us to remember what he hath &s;aid, who died for the &s;ins of the whole world, "and I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw ALL men unto me."</P>
<P>LET it not be imagined here, that I would &s;o much as intimate, that God is under any obligation to &s;ave men finally; becau&s;e that, in the di&s;pen&s;ations of his government, they have been very mi&s;erable in this world: Or that tho&s;e who have been mo&s;t &s;o, have <HI>in ju&s;tice,</HI> any claim of reparation on their Ma|ker. I mean no &s;uch thing. I argue only from the nature and attributes of JEHOVAH, as they appear in his word and works. He is worthy to be God &s;upreme, by his own in|finite worth, by virtue of his own infinitely glorious and lovely perfections. He is <HI>by nature</HI> God, as &s;ome have well expre&s;&s;ed it.</P>
<P>MY hope is founded entirely on his <HI>nature</HI> and <HI>di&s;po&s;ition,</HI> through his own Son made manife&s;t. In this manife&s;tation, GOD IS LOVE. His moral di&s;po&s;ition is infinitely amiable and inviting. It is the &s;upreme joy of all holy, wi&s;e, intelligent beings, that there is &s;uch a God. His nature is the ba&s;is of all happine&s;s, and the foundation of all hope. It is the &s;ource of all our comfort, that there is &s;uch a God over all, ble&s;&s;ed forevermore; that he is Creator, Proprietor, and ab&s;olute Di&s;po&s;er of all things, ab&s;olutely &s;overeign and uncontrouled; and that he worketh all things according to the coun&s;el of his own
<PB N="248" REF="030609_0247_0FE82E627317BA28">
will. <HI>For his will flows from a nature infi|nitely glorious and lovely.</HI></P>
<P>WE have no claim of ju&s;tice on him who gave us our whole being, who&s;e ab&s;olute property we are. Whatever he does with us, he meddles with nothing but his own. Hence, I argue only from the immutable na|ture of God, infinitely perfect and good, and from his plain word and all his manife&s;t|ations. I &s;ay, the&s;e do a&s;certain the final redemption of a whole guilty world, or, that he will have all men to be &s;aved.</P>
<P>HAD there been an eternal, Supreme Be|ing, Creator and ab&s;olute Proprietor of all things, as JEHOVAH is; who in his <HI>moral di&s;|po&s;ition,</HI> his <HI>moral nature,</HI> had been ju&s;t the rever&s;e from what he really is. Horrible &s;uppo&s;ition! but lawful in the view I make it. Had he created innumerable myriads of rational creatures more than ever yet had ex|i&s;tence; and made them all con&s;ummately &s;inful and mi&s;erable; and had we our place in that woful &s;cale of beings, doomed to end|le&s;s &s;in, &s;orrow, and pain unutterable: Even on this &s;uppo&s;ition, we could have no claim of ju&s;tice, on our Maker, as we have upon our fellow creatures who injure us, and bring pain and mi&s;ery upon us. They take hold of property not their own, but ours, in op|po&s;ition to their claim; and therefore we may in ju&s;tice demand reparation of them. Not &s;o is it with regard to the &s;upreme Foun|tain of all being, who is the Creator and ab|&s;olute Proprietor of all things, including all the feelings and &s;ufferings of creatures.
<PB N="249" REF="030609_0248_0FE82F1A4A989DB0">
Their very pains and all their affections are his property: For their whole being is &s;o.</P>
<P>IN &s;uch an awful, lamentable ca&s;e, as a|bove &s;uppo&s;ed, we could never accu&s;e our Maker of inju&s;tice, with any kind of pro|priety. All we could &s;ay would be to howl, in doleful accents, to all eternity; "<HI>the Su|preme reigneth, let all creatures mourn; let the multitude of beings lament and bewail!</HI> woe! woe! woe! to mi&s;erable creatures, that &s;uch is the nature and di&s;po&s;ition of him that ruleth over all." I cannot think we do any honor to the ble&s;&s;ed JEHOVAH, in a&s;|cribing to him a moral nature, in any wi&s;e &s;imilar to this. One as oppo&s;ite thereto as we can po&s;&s;ibly conceive of, is indeed the very nature of that ble&s;&s;ed Being whom we adore. God's will cannot po&s;&s;ibly, in the nature of things, be unju&s;t; and by <HI>his own immutable nature,</HI> it is infinitely good, and the &s;pring of all ble&s;&s;edne&s;s and joy. Dif|fu&s;ion of being and ble&s;&s;edne&s;s flows from the nature of God. This doctrine exhibits JEHOVAH, as the true God, whom angels and &s;aints adore, "Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, the fir&s;t and the la&s;t."</P>
<P>IF we carefully attend to the holy &s;crip|tures, we do not find any holy men in&s;i&s;t|ing upon terms of limitation with God, as though they thought there could ever be in the di&s;po&s;ition, or will of God any po&s;&s;ibi|lity of doing wrong to them. They all ap+pear to choo&s;e God &s;hould be ju&s;t as he is,
<PB N="250" REF="030609_0249_0FE82F81A2F1A208">
or as his own nature does di&s;po&s;e and incline him; and they know he ever will be &s;o di&s;|po&s;ed towards them. This is their happi|ne&s;s; and in this they put all their confi|dence. All their hopes ari&s;e from this; al|though they have ever looked on them&s;elves as &s;it objects of eternal mi&s;ery, as any crea|tures that ever God made. His character is often, and with great propriety, called his name. Poor, penitent, believing &s;inners re|pair to nothing el&s;e, nothing but his charac|ter and di&s;po&s;ition as manife&s;ted in a Savior, in whom only they are righteous. "The name of the Lord is a &s;trong tower: The righteous runneth into it and are &s;afe."</P>
<P>IT is truly for the honor of JEHOVAH, that we &s;hould all know, that he alone is the ab|&s;olute &s;ource of all being and ble&s;&s;edne&s;s: That he is ab&s;olute, &s;overeign, and uncon|trouled, in every view, no foreign influence of any kind or degree ever acting on him: That his creatures never can nor &s;hall have any thing el&s;e to found their hopes upon, but his own glorious nature and &s;overeign will: That his manife&s;tations are all glori|ous and comfortable to every human &s;oul, that under&s;tands and believes them: And that it is not the under&s;tanding and belief of a &s;inner that makes them &s;o, but they are &s;o in their own nature.</P>
<P>NO &s;inner of mankind does God any hon|or, by believing that all his own hopes of pardon and &s;alvation, depend as much on him&s;elf, as it is po&s;&s;ible any thing can depend on a creature, viz. on &s;ome di&s;po&s;ition or
<PB N="251" REF="030609_0250_0FE82F0A05BE1BA8">
qualification in him&s;elf. This denies God his proper character, in his relation to &s;inful man. But to believe the ble&s;&s;ed God has given qualifications as &s;ure to unworthy &s;inners, in his own way and time, as he hath provided an all-&s;ufficient Savior for a guilty world, is a&s;cribing to God all his glorious attributes, "working all things (without the lea&s;t exception) according to the coun&s;el of his own will."</P>
<P>IF the <HI>limitarians</HI> could be di&s;po&s;ed to think, &s;tudy and read as much on this point, as the writer hath done for many years pa&s;t, with an ardent de&s;ire to find nothing but the truth to re&s;t in; they would &s;ee that it does no honor to the great and glorious God to make eternal &s;alvation, in the lea&s;t, depend on any creature, as to the certain event of it. Indeed, all the powers of the &s;oul are fitly exerci&s;ed by a &s;overeign God, in his own way, in the application and enjoyment of all that flows out of the mere goodne&s;s of his own nature, in a way honorable to him|&s;elf, by the &s;ub&s;titution and mediation of the &s;econd man, the Lord from heaven.</P>
<P>I CAN find no plan of religion but this, that can ever warrant the great charity, and u|nion among men, which is &s;o much recom|mended in the &s;acred oracles. If we con&s;i|der our&s;elves as di&s;tingui&s;hed from mo&s;t of our fellow men, in the eternal purpo&s;es and views of God: That we are de&s;tined to his infinite, everla&s;ting love, and mo&s;t others to his hatred, wrath and vengeance forever|more;
<PB N="252" REF="030609_0251_0FE82F872021D868">
we &s;hall hardly find it in our hearts to exerci&s;e that pity, and tenderne&s;s, love and good will to them, that the go&s;pel re|quires. If we think our God will be their eternal enemy, and delight him&s;elf in their eternal de&s;truction; we &s;hall hardly feel our&s;elves friendly to our God, in loving and pitying all mankind, and &s;triving all in our power for their &s;alvation. You cannot more di&s;plea&s;e your fellow men, than by manife&s;ting great love and tenderne&s;s to their enemies.</P>
<P>AGAIN; In conver&s;ation, or in hearing the word preached, or in reading the mul|titude of good authors that have written on our mo&s;t important concerns, we cannot up|on any other plan, maintain go&s;pel candor. We &s;hall find the light and communications of God to men &s;o various; and their chan|nel of preaching or writing, in many re&s;|pects, &s;o devious from one another; that we &s;hall be ready to &s;cruple whether there is any truth in the doctrine of a &s;pecial revela|tion from heaven. We &s;hall fall away, at lea&s;t, as far as Dei&s;m. But, on the plan, for which I am pleading, the whole difficul|ty is obviated: As every writer unin&s;pired, every preacher may be wrong in many things, and &s;ome in many more than others; yet all be e&s;&s;entially right. By them God com|municates light and truth to the world, in various mea&s;ures and degrees. Perhaps, it has not as yet been fit, in the &s;ight of God, in the former, or pre&s;ent gradations of di|vine communication, to enlighten any au|thor,
<PB N="253" REF="030609_0252_0FE82F8989C90528">
or preacher &s;o, but that all have been involved in more darkne&s;s than they have &s;een of the true light. Hence ari&s;es great bitterne&s;s of &s;pirit towards many, or uni|ver&s;al &s;ceptici&s;m. But on the gracious prin|ciples I am &s;upporting, we can re&s;t contented, that the infinitely wi&s;e Being &s;hould cau&s;e the light to dawn and increa&s;e ju&s;t as fa&s;t as his own wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s dictate. And we can love one another as the go&s;pel re|quires; though under various degrees of in|&s;truction, and under various modes of think|ing.</P>
<P>THUS, if I read an author, or hear a &s;er|mon which I look upon one half according to truth, and the other half not &s;o; that part which is good, ought to &s;et as well on my mind as if the whole was &s;o, and I ought to love the writer, or the preacher, and ble&s;s God that they are enlightened &s;o far as they are. This I take to be a go&s;pel &s;pirit, and if &s;o, it is according to the truth of the go&s;pel. It is for want of &s;uch a &s;pirit, that many will reject all that is good in an author or preacher, becau&s;e of the many mi&s;takes, or &s;uppo&s;ed mi&s;takes found in both. But, in good truth, if we will be in&s;tructed and edi|fied by none, but tho&s;e who are right in all things, we deprive our&s;elves of the whole benefit of in&s;truction, or edification from any man unin&s;pired.</P>
<P>THE doctrine I am pleading for, is much in favor of go&s;pel love and charity, harmo|ny and peace. This is one mark of the truth of it. The true tendency of this principle is
<PB N="254" REF="030609_0253_0FE82EC9F0B87538">
&s;o far from di&s;po&s;ing tho&s;e who believe it, to contend and quarrel with the teachers and mini&s;ters of the chri&s;tian churches, where|with they are now furni&s;hed, that it will in|duce them to love them more than ever, and to treat them with all po&s;&s;ible kindne&s;s. At the &s;ame time, we &s;hall wi&s;h and pray, that it may plea&s;e God to lead them further into tho&s;e glorious truths, which they under&s;tand but in part. Thus it will have that quiet, and peaceful influence among mini&s;ters and people, which &s;o much adorns the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>THE true import of the initiating &s;eal among God's covenant people, both in the former and pre&s;ent oeconomy, confirms the doctrine which I am advocating.</P>
<P>THE whole Jewi&s;h church, and the great body of chri&s;tians, who practi&s;e the initia|ting &s;eal in infancy, have ever under&s;tood it to be a &s;eal of the covenant of grace, to which even the infant &s;eed of covenant pa|rents, have a right, and are thereby &s;ealed in the covenant of grace and &s;alvation; even though they have always allowed, that &s;uch children are per&s;onally no better than the infants of heathen. An infant among the Jews, at eight days old, was &s;uppo&s;ed to be no better, <HI>per&s;onally,</HI> than any children of other nations; yet they were &s;ealed by cir|cumci&s;ion in the covenant of grace and &s;al|vation; even as they are now by bapti&s;m.</P>
<P>THE church of God and the ordinances of it, from the days of Abraham to this day, were de&s;igned and in&s;tituted as a light or
<PB N="255" REF="030609_0254_0FE82F8F00735758">
lamp which God holds up in the world, to beam forth by degrees, and fully manife&s;t, in due time, his purpo&s;es of mercy and &s;alva|tion to a guilty world, through that Mediator which he appointed to take away the &s;in of the whole world. Hence God hath com|manded that all the infants of covenant pa|rents &s;hould be &s;ealed, though per&s;onally in the &s;ame unregenerate &s;tate with the world in general, as a te&s;timony that all were pur|cha&s;ed by the common Redeemer of &s;inners, and &s;hould be brought to actual enjoyment of &s;alvation, in the time and manner mo&s;t fit in the eyes of infinite wi&s;dom and good|ne&s;s. Hence any child of a pagan has right to the &s;eal, if its lot is providentially a|mong God's covenant people, and under proper circum&s;tances to be trained up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY, the commi&s;&s;ion given to the apo&s;tles, was, to go forth and teach all nations, and to command them to believe that divine truth which bringeth &s;alvation, and to baptize all nations to whom they preached, both parents and children, (if they would &s;ubmit to it) as a &s;eal of the common &s;alvation. This was not a token that they had done, or ever could do any thing to|ward their own &s;alvation; but that Al|mighty God, Father, Son and Holy Gho&s;t, had engaged to accompli&s;h the &s;alvation of a guilty world, and had made all &s;ure, and would &s;eal it by bapti&s;m.</P>
<P>WE can, upon no other principle, make u&s;e of the &s;eals and &s;pecial ordinances with
<PB N="256" REF="030609_0255_0FE82F91B3C53068">
any con&s;i&s;tency. How &s;hall we &s;eal, in the covenant of grace and &s;alvation, per&s;ons de|&s;tined and decreed to eternal per&s;onal dam|nation? How &s;hall we admit tho&s;e to the holy &s;upper, a &s;eal of our eating and drink|ing with Chri&s;t, at his table, in his heavenly kingdom, who may be, for ought we know, not only in an unrevealed &s;tate at pre&s;ent, but al&s;o under an irrever&s;ible decree of eter|nal reprobation? Would the Mo&s;t High, in any wi&s;e, allow his &s;eals to be &s;o u&s;ed? God never would have &s;et &s;uch blind creatures as we are, about the work of admitting into the church, and exerci&s;ing di&s;cipline, or to handle the &s;eals of grace and &s;alvation, had his own plan been a <HI>limitarian</HI> plan, or had he &s;ent his Son into the world on any other errand than that the world through him might be &s;aved.</P>
<P>DISCIPLINE mu&s;t indeed be kept up in the church; and the body elected to &s;uch &s;pecial and glorious privileges, out of a world, as yet buried in darkne&s;s, mu&s;t be kept vi&s;ibly pure, as bearing a proper, vi|&s;ible re&s;emblance to its pure and holy head. Tho&s;e members that do not bear this vi&s;ible re&s;emblance, mu&s;t be delivered to Satan, yet only "<HI>for the de&s;truction of the fle&s;h.</HI>" A dreadful thing it is, to be in a &s;tate of excommunication from the privileges and con&s;olations of the people of God in the world; but there is nothing in it that affects the certainty of eternal &s;alvation at the great day: For the expre&s;s end of every final cen&s;ure on earth, is, "<HI>that the &s;pirit may be &s;aved in the day of our Lord Je&s;us.</HI>" 1. Cor.
<PB N="257" REF="030609_0256_0FE82F9806193FB0">
v. 5. What&s;oever is thus bound on earth, &s;hall be bound in heaven, both as to its propriety and good tendency in this world, and its glorious i&s;&s;ue in the world to come, even the &s;alvation of the &s;oul in the day of the Lord. Hence an excommunicated per|&s;on is &s;till a brother, and not to be "treated as an enemy; but admoni&s;hed as a brother."</P>
<P>MANY &s;ouls for whom Chri&s;t died, have ju&s;tly experienced the awful &s;entence of ex|communication from his church on earth: Even Mo&s;es and Paul were willing to &s;uf|fer the &s;ame, if it might redound to the glory of God and the &s;alvation of &s;ouls. i. e. As mo&s;t have under&s;tood them. Yet this doth by no means fru&s;trate the irrever|&s;ible and exten&s;ive plan of redeeming love, to gather together in one all things in Chri&s;t, and to make all men, in due time, &s;ee the glory of this my&s;tery, which for many ages and generations lay hid in great ob&s;curity.</P>
<P>GOD's church on earth, his vi&s;ible cove|nant people were always de&s;igned, in his infinite wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s, as a lamp, a light to the world, a city &s;et on an hill, to manife&s;t and hold forth to a lo&s;t world what God hath done for them, and what he would do. The church is a pre&s;ent, vi&s;ible repre|&s;entation of divine love and mercy to &s;inners, to a lo&s;t world. The church holds forth to the world the glorious God with all his di|vine attributes and ble&s;&s;ed purpo&s;es, and the Savior of all men, in all his glorious offices, and the Holy Spirit, in all his infinite and
<PB N="258" REF="030609_0257_0FE82F998C7BCD00">
almighty energy. "By the church is made known the manifold wi&s;dom of God." Eph. iii. 10. The church was not &s;et up in the world, to &s;hew us how much better &s;ome men are than others, or what a re&s;pecter of per&s;ons God is, in his purpo&s;es and opera|tions; but rather to witne&s;s that God hath concluded all under &s;in, that he might have mercy upon all. Not to hold forth the worth and riches of any community of poor &s;inners; but rather, the un&s;earchable riches of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>ANOTHER argument again&s;t the <HI>limitarian</HI> &s;cheme, is this: <HI>No man,</HI> on their principles, <HI>can do his duty; even if his whole heart and di&s;|po&s;ition were perfectly right.</HI></P>
<P>IT is our duty to acquie&s;ce in God's will in every event. But an holy heart cannot do this in &s;uch an event as his own eternal damnation, or that of any of his fellow men. The principal mi&s;ery of that eternal damna|tion they plead for, lies in an eternal, fixed and growing oppo&s;ition of heart to an holy God, and the horrible rebellion proceeding from &s;uch an heart. It is certain an holy and right heart, which is full of love to God, cannot feel willing to be thus at enmity with God, and hate and rebel again&s;t him to all eternity. It is equally certain, that an holy man, that loves his neighbor as him&s;elf, and values his neighbor's happine&s;s as his own, and is exceedingly aver&s;e to any di&s;honor done to God, any oppo&s;ition again&s;t him, as much if it be in his neighbor as in him|&s;elf,
<PB N="259" REF="030609_0258_0FE82F9E1F1DBE78">
cannot be willing that his neighbor &s;hould thus hate and &s;in again&s;t God to all eternity. If we do not &s;o love our neigh|bors in all things as our&s;elves, we fall &s;hort of that perfect benevolence required of us.</P>
<P>BESIDES, the nature of this oppo&s;ition to God is infinitely evil and odious, whether in our&s;elves, or in any of the human kind. Hence if our hearts are right, we &s;hall feel a great oppo&s;ition to it, and can never be plea&s;ed with it, or reconciled to it. We mu&s;t be exceedingly wicked, to be reconcil|ed to &s;uch great and eternal wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P>IT is true, the redeemed will in the true go&s;pel &s;en&s;e &s;ee the &s;moke of their torment a&s;cend up forever and ever, and &s;hout Alle|luia in the view of it; but this will be in the manner I have before taken notice of, only in the gla&s;s of <HI>pure ju&s;tice,</HI> in the gla&s;s of the divine law. Thus they will eternally &s;ee all the human race, and them&s;elves as well as others, forever dwelling with devouring fire and everla&s;ting burnings; while, in <HI>ve|ry fact</HI> and in <HI>per&s;on,</HI> they &s;hall from their munition of rocks &s;hout Alleluia, finding the bread of life &s;u&s;taining their happy &s;ouls, and the waters of everla&s;ting con&s;olation made &s;ure.</P>
<P>IT never can be found in a holy heart to take any more &s;atisfaction in the rebellion of others again&s;t God than in his own; both are infinitely hateful to a &s;oul obedient to God. The <HI>limitarian</HI> plan, if fully con&s;ider|ed, and realized &s;eriou&s;ly in the &s;oul, (which is very little done) can never meet with the
<PB N="260" REF="030609_0259_0FE82ECF7A621350">
approbation of the friends of God. They will feel their hearts inclined like the infinite|ly benevolent heart of God, who will have all men to be &s;aved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth. They will pray for the &s;alvation of all, and plead this warrant &s;o to do, viz. It is the will of God and our Savior, who gave him&s;elf a ran&s;om for all, to be te&s;tified in due time.</P>
<P>FURTHER, the charitable hope and de&s;ire of good people, &s;uch as the go&s;pel requires, is certainly agreeable to the word of God. Now &s;uppo&s;e all the race of mankind that ever have lived in the world, or ever &s;hall be in it, were to pa&s;s before any godly man, individually in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. A&s;k that good man, as he views them pa&s;&s;ing before his eyes one after another, with regard to each in particular, "Do you hope and de&s;ire that in the infinite mercy of God through Chri&s;t, <HI>that man</HI> may be &s;aved?" He would &s;ay <HI>yes, with all my heart.</HI> So he would &s;ay of the fir&s;t that pa&s;&s;ed before him, and &s;o of the &s;econd, and the &s;ame of every one. To an|&s;wer otherwi&s;e, would indicate a &s;pirit not regulated by the word of God, i. e. not ac|cording to truth. But thus to expre&s;s our de&s;ire and hope of each individual of the human race, would certainly include the whole. Yet a man de&s;titute of &s;uch de&s;ires, hopes and prayers, we &s;hould not look up|on as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a go&s;pel &s;pirit, or &s;uch a friend to &s;ouls as the go&s;pel requires. What &s;hould we think of a man that would &s;ay, I
<PB N="261" REF="030609_0260_0FE82ED20C36EC30">
de&s;ire mo&s;t of the&s;e may be in the greate&s;t mi&s;ery to all eternity?</P>
<P>THE prayers of good men for their mo&s;t malicious enemies, for the vile&s;t creatures in the world; &s;uch as the prayers of David, and that of Stephen when he was dying, under a &s;hower of malice from his enemies and the enemies of God; the&s;e prayers, I &s;ay, were not without faith, and a good foundation of faith; and of con&s;equence, were heard and an&s;wered of God. Yet, if any are to be eternally damned in their own per&s;ons, we &s;hould imagine that &s;uch mali|cious per&s;ecutors, and murderers would cer|tainly be found among them. We &s;hould think that the murderers of Chri&s;t, at lea&s;t &s;ome of the many thou&s;ands combined in that mo&s;t malicious of all &s;ins, would be ob|jects of God's eternal wrath; but it is as certain they were all forgiven, as it is that the prayers of Chri&s;t were always an&s;wered, and all his petitions granted at all times. "<HI>And I knew that thou heare&s;t me always:</HI> John xi. 42.</P>
<P>IF it were po&s;&s;ible for people to dive&s;t them&s;elves of the long, deep, and rooted prejudices ari&s;ing from the <HI>limitarian</HI> &s;cheme, every man would mo&s;t clearly &s;ee that we have no foundation or warrant, in rea&s;on or &s;cripture, to pray as good people ever have done, or as Chri&s;t did for the vile&s;t of men, for their pardon and eternal &s;alvation, but a warrant of this nature, viz. It is the will of God and our Savior, it is his will, without any equivocation or collu&s;ion, that all men
<PB N="262" REF="030609_0261_0FE82FA089D7E5C0">
&s;hall be &s;aved, and, in his own way and time, come to the knowledge of the truth; and that con&s;i&s;tent with his truth, holine&s;s and greate&s;t honor, by a proper atonement; as Chri&s;t gave him&s;elf a ran&s;om for all to be te&s;tified in due times, or fit &s;ea&s;ons. 1. Tim. ii.</P>
<P>IF we were to &s;ingle out any one of the multitude combined in the murder of Je&s;us, as being the wor&s;t of all, perhaps we &s;hould pitch upon Judas to be the man. And he indeed met with an awful and aggravated damnation, in the highe&s;t &s;en&s;e of the term, in the true &s;cripture meaning of it, as it re|lates to any mere man per&s;onally. What this his damnation or perdition was, I have before &s;hewn. But it is ju&s;t as certain that he was forgiven of God, in his own time, and all the re&s;t of the horrible, blind, malicious multitude, as that Je&s;us cried to his Father with his dying breath, "<HI>Father forgive them; for they know not what they do.</HI>"</P>
<P>CHRIST never made but one conditional prayer, and that he made for this &s;pecial rea|&s;on, to leave an everla&s;ting te&s;timony to the world, that &s;in, whether actual or imputed, could never be di&s;charged without a full &s;a|tisfaction to the divine law. That prayer related to his own &s;ufferings, and was intro|duced with an hypothe&s;is, and clo&s;ed with full &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the will of God. See Mat. xxvi. and other parallel records in the evangeli&s;ts. All the re&s;t of his prayers were peremptory, without any condition. On the ground of his atonement, all having the
<PB N="263" REF="030609_0262_0FE82E98C17886A0">
force of a ju&s;t and ab&s;olute demand. "<HI>Fath|er I will,</HI>" is the tenor of all the prayers that ever Chri&s;t made for guilty men.</P>
<P>IT is proper for us further to con&s;ider, that God will accompli&s;h the highe&s;t glory of his own attributes; and that it is certain, they are all more glorified in the &s;alvation, than in the per&s;onal damnation of any &s;in|ner, or every &s;inner on earth.</P>
<P>IN the &s;alvation of &s;uch vile, guilty crea|tures as we are, every divine attribute doth &s;hine mo&s;t gloriou&s;ly, and all in perfect har|mony. No attributes are more glorious than the infinite pity and mercy of God to &s;in|ners, with his power and good will to &s;ave them freely. This mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed part of the divine character is not &s;een, it makes no di&s;|covery of it&s;elf with regard to many millions, on the <HI>limitarian</HI> &s;cheme. Neither can the holine&s;s and ju&s;tice of God, ever &s;hine &s;o gloriou&s;ly bright in the per&s;onal damnation of any &s;inner, or of all the poor &s;inners in the world, as in the great atonement, exact|ing full &s;atisfaction of a per&s;onage infinitely greater and dearer to God than any mere man, or all the mere human race. If you leave room, in the glorious plan of our re|demption, for all to be per&s;onally damned, you take away all the glory of it: And you derogate from this glory, in ju&s;t proportion, as you hold, that any number &s;hall be per|&s;onally damned, be that number more or le&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="030609_0263_0FE82FA7C6E42CE8">THAT doctrine which repre&s;ents all &s;in, all moral evil, in the mo&s;t odious and abo|minable a&s;pect, has thence, one evidence of being a true doctrine.</P>
<P>THERE is no other under&s;tanding of the word, nature, and character of God, that makes oppo&s;ition to him and rebellion a|gain&s;t him, appear &s;o full of mi&s;chief, and ingratitude, as this I am pleading for. To oppo&s;e &s;uch a God, as I con&s;ider JEHOVAH to be, on this plan of creating, governing and redeeming the world; how abomina|ble! All the glorious attributes of God would be effectually ob&s;tructed, in their di&s;plays and operations; and the whole creation, that wonderful child of divine love, would &s;uffer the mo&s;t barbarous murder, if &s;inners might have their perver&s;e wills gra|tified, in all their nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equences. The infinite, eternal fountain of love, being and ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, would be wholly dried up; and rebellion again&s;t &s;uch a character, would leave nothing but con&s;ummate woe and mi&s;ery in the univer&s;e. To rebel again&s;t infinite power and knowledge, if united with a di&s;po&s;ition oppo&s;ite to that of infinite love, (could &s;uch a being exi&s;t) would not be like rebelling again&s;t our infinitely kind and merciful, heavenly Father. To rebel again&s;t the cruele&s;t tyrant that ever was cloathed with de&s;potic power, might be a perilous thing; but not like rebelling again&s;t the kinde&s;t, mo&s;t compa&s;&s;ionate and loving ru|ler that a happy people was ever ble&s;&s;ed with.</P>

This is the nature of all &s;in, and not the le&s;s odious and abominable, becau&s;e God counteracts the whole by his almighty power and love; but the odiou&s;ne&s;s of &s;in is rather enhanced and aggravated for this very rea&s;on. The real nature and di&s;|po&s;ition of our God is, to emanate being and ble&s;&s;edne&s;s far and wide, and that for|evermore. The nature of &s;in is to ob&s;truct all this, and therefore no words can expre&s;s the odiou&s;ne&s;s of it. For &s;in is to be infi|nitely hated only for its nature. Merely as an event, it belongs to the pure and holy plan, and good government of Deity: Who, even in infinite love and goodne&s;s, &s;aw fit not to hinder the exi&s;tence of it, however infinitely hateful; and will certainly turn it all to good account, (even contrary to its na|ture) to the greate&s;t happine&s;s of his crea|tures. Thus the whole &s;y&s;tem of being &s;hall, in the re&s;ult of all, be the perfection of love and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT, were the moral di&s;po&s;ition of a Su|preme Being &s;uch as to propagate &s;ome hap|pine&s;s

and abundance of mi&s;ery, and that eternal, though, in regard to his ab&s;olute property in all things (which I have often mentioned) we might not accu&s;e him of in|ju&s;tice; yet mo&s;t of his creatures could do no other than lament their fate in bitter howlings and deepe&s;t agonies of &s;oul, be|cau&s;e being and mi&s;ery had been forced up|on them. Our glory and ble&s;&s;edne&s;s lies in this, that JEHOVAH is what he is. "I AM THAT I AM." To be di&s;affected to &s;uch a God, oh, how criminal!</P>
<P>MOREOVER, that &s;alvation is en&s;ured to &s;inners, by the death of Chri&s;t, without the lea&s;t dependence on any qualifications in them; but, on the contrary, that all the qualifications nece&s;&s;ary to their enjoyment of the benefit are in&s;ured by his death, is man|ife&s;t expre&s;sly from Heb. ix. as well as from the whole tenor of the go&s;pel. A te&s;tator in&s;ures the legacy, at his death, without any regard at all to the pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition, or even the knowledge of any one of the lega|tees. He has made the te&s;tament, and, when he dies, it becomes unalterable, and the heirs take the benefit, whenever it comes to their knowledge. This is the idea of the apo&s;tle to the Hebrews, on this point. To the &s;ame purpo&s;e he writes Titus iii. 4. 5, 6. "After that the love and kindne&s;s of God towards man appeared, not by works of righteou&s;|ne&s;s, which we have done; but according to his mercy he &s;aved us, by the wa&s;hing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy

Gho&s;t; which he &s;hed on us abundantly through Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Savior." So it every where appears from the holy &s;crip|tures, that the atonement, in all ca&s;es, in|&s;ures qualifications, or the application of the whole benefit; and <HI>not that our qualifications in&s;ure an atonement,</HI> in our behalf; that the undertaking and purcha&s;e of Chri&s;t is at the bottom of all, leads in the whole of the &s;al|vation of &s;inners, makes all &s;ure; and that the whole application and all qualifications are but con&s;equences, through the kingly and prophetic offices of Chri&s;t, co-exten&s;ive with his prie&s;tly impetration.</P>
<P>NO man on earth can ever obtain a&s;&s;ur|ance of his &s;afe e&s;tate, or any good hope to|wards God, on any other foundation than the real and univer&s;al grace of God. For, while believing, penitent &s;inners are labor|ing to build any hope at all, on good di&s;tinc|tions, and good qualifications in them&s;elves, they can find nothing but what points them out for eternal de&s;truction. And they will &s;ink deeper and deeper in de&s;pair, in this way, as they look deeper and deeper in|to their hearts and lives for any ground of hope. God, and he alone is "the hope of I&s;|rael and Savior thereof, in the day of trouble." "Other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid, which is Je&s;us Chri&s;t." In &s;uch a God and &s;uch a Savior, the vile&s;t &s;inner on earth may find comfort and &s;alvation. "Look unto me and be ye &s;aved all the ends of the earth; for I am God and not man, the Holy One in the mid&s;t of thee."</P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="030609_0267_0FE82FAFD35F88A0">WE may add, that this under&s;tanding of divine revelation, not only leaves the holy bible free from all contradictions and incon|&s;i&s;tencies; but al&s;o takes away the main ground of all <HI>dei&s;tical</HI> &s;cruples and doubts.</P>
<P>MANY are inclined to dei&s;m, under the light of divine revelation, becau&s;e they &s;ee &s;uch an infinite variety of opinions among revelationi&s;ts, innumerable different &s;ects among tho&s;e, who in common, hold the &s;a|cred bible for their rule of faith. They are all alike concerned in the great things con|tained therein, and alike &s;incere and hone&s;t in what they profe&s;s to believe; yet, there is &s;uch variety of opinion, and &s;uch oppo|&s;ition of &s;entiment, in many points, ma|ny are thence inclined to doubt whether the doctrine of &s;uch a &s;pecial revelation is not wholly groundle&s;s; and &s;o fall away in|to infidelity.</P>
<P>ON my plea, all this inducement to de|i&s;m is removed. We con&s;ider the all-wi&s;e and &s;overeign God, as enlightening man|kind in various mea&s;ures and degrees, in his own time, way and manner. All are right in &s;ome degree, more or le&s;s, and none but what have much darkne&s;s mixed with the be&s;t light they have. All agree in one, as far as light is given to each re&s;pectively. They differ not, on the account of their knowledge of the bible, &s;o far as they un|der&s;tand it; but only for want of more knowledge of it, and a better under&s;tanding of its true meaning. Thus all &s;ects in the world, all opinioni&s;ts, however diver&s;e in
<PB N="269" REF="030609_0268_0FE82FB15B620280">
many things, do indeed con&s;pire and unite in confirming the truth of the &s;acred bi|ble.</P>
<P>WHEN I hear all that <HI>papi&s;ts</HI> &s;ay of reli|gion, though I perceive great ignorance and darkne&s;s in them; yet I have thence great confirmation that there is indeed a &s;pecial revelation from God, and that the &s;ame is contained in the old and new te&s;taments. When I find <HI>mahometans</HI> defending the old te&s;tament, though they deny the new, I am by them confirmed in the truth of both. Yea, when I hear any <HI>pagans</HI> in the world, talk about their own religion, (for none are without religion) I ea&s;ily &s;ee &s;omething they have derived from the bible, in &s;ome indi|rect way or other: Even as we have light from the &s;un by way of the moon, and many other media of reflection; all witne&s;&s;ing alike that there is a &s;un. So every &s;ect of pagans on earth confirm me in my faith. I find they are all taught of God, as the bible teaches, &s;o far as they are taught at all. Their many error are all owing to negative con&s;iderations. i. e. Where light extends no further, darkne&s;s will remain on their minds. So far as God has been plea&s;ed to lead them to the knowledge of truth, they are right; and in all be&s;ide they mu&s;t be wrong. So when I take a view of the great variety of opinions among <HI>prote&s;tants,</HI> whom I look up|on more enlightened than any other people in the world; they all confirm me in the belief that the bible is from God; though they greatly vary in many things, and op|po&s;e

one another in points almo&s;t endle&s;s to name.</P>
<P>IF I am right in my under&s;tanding of God's de&s;ign and method, his merciful and wi&s;e plan of operation to &s;ave a guilty world by his dear Son; then my faith is ju&s;tly confirmed by all the&s;e things, which, on any other principles, will tend greatly to confound the mind. On any other Scheme of &s;alvation, a very few there be, but what are de&s;tined to eternal, unutterable torments. Who alas! are tho&s;e few that &s;hall e&s;cape? <HI>All are damned by each other;</HI> and I think with equal authority: But, ble&s;&s;ed be God, the great Judge is THE SAVIOR OF ALL MEN, and hath taken away the &s;in of the whole world.</P>
<P>I AM edified, and comforted by every &s;e|rious, hone&s;t man, that I hear talk upon his religion, whatever degrees of light God hath been plea&s;ed to give him, be they more or le&s;s. I am mo&s;t edified where there is mo&s;t light; but truly the light is &s;weet, even in the lea&s;t degrees of it. I find &s;omething from God given to every &s;ect, and party; and that gives me delight. So it is with me, and &s;o it mu&s;t be with all that receive di|vine revelation in this light. Which, I think, is one mark that it is the true light, in which we ought to under&s;tand it; as it bears the &s;tamp of its divine Author, who "is the true light, which LIGHTETH EVERY MAN that cometh into the world." And oh! what charity, love, and mutual friend&s;hip mu&s;t flow from &s;uch a view of God and his
<PB N="271" REF="030609_0270_0FE82FB9375A3A20">
ways! This is that charity which is the bond of perfectne&s;s.</P>
<P>THERE is no other doctrine of grace, that will &s;o encourage the u&s;e of all the means of grace and &s;alvation, and &s;o enforce upon our minds the fitne&s;s and propriety of all the in&s;titutions of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>I CONSIDER the whole divine plan con|nected indi&s;&s;olubly: All made &s;ure; not in any di&s;tinction of means and end; but all in one indi&s;&s;oluble chain. So that it is as true and proper to &s;ay, that none can be &s;aved without regeneration, repentance, faith, and holine&s;s, as to &s;ay that the extreme link in any chain cannot be drawn forward, by an hand at the oppo&s;ite end of the chain, unle&s;s every link in the &s;ame chain is moved. It is always true, and always will be, that he that believeth not &s;hall be damned, and is indeed damned per&s;onally, &s;o long as he re|main in that &s;tate. "He is condemned al|ready;" "the wrath of God abideth on him," and will &s;o abide, until he is brought out of that &s;tate of infidelity and impeni|tence.</P>
<P>THE greater our hope is in the u&s;e of means to obtain any important end, the greater will be our exertions in every ca&s;e, without exception. Full a&s;&s;urance of &s;uc|ce&s;s will excite the greate&s;t exertions of all, provided we know that &s;ure &s;ucce&s;s is only in this way. So, when Paul told the &s;ailors, from the mouth of an angel, that not one of their lives &s;hould be lo&s;t by the &s;hipwreck,
<PB N="272" REF="030609_0271_0FE82FBFC3F2D958">
Acts xxvii. they exerted them&s;elves much the more vigorou&s;ly to obey his directions afterwards, in u&s;ing the means, as he told them it was the only way in which they could be &s;aved. Every careful ob&s;erver of human nature, and of the force of motives, well knows it is &s;o in every ca&s;e. If the end is very important in our view, and there is but ju&s;t one way to attain it; yet, if &s;ucce&s;s in that way is altogether dubious, and mo&s;t likely our labors and efforts will be all in vain, we might probably exert our|&s;elves in &s;ome degree, though with a faint heart. But, let us know a&s;&s;uredly we &s;hall attain our important end, if we will exert our&s;elves with all our might, and that this is the only way; this will animate all the powers we have, and we &s;hall engage to pur|po&s;e. The ca&s;e is ju&s;t the &s;ame in this mat|ter of infinite weight, as in other ca&s;es of a temporal concern; excepting only that our exertions are excited with much greater force.</P>
<P>MOREOVER, the infinite rea&s;onablene&s;s of religion and the &s;ervice of God; the un|&s;peakable plea&s;ure of it, and the &s;uperior re|ward in heaven, <HI>in proportion</HI> to our &s;ignal obedience and piety in this &s;tate of proba|tion; the great and good influence of religion and virtue, as relative to the &s;piritual, and even temporal good of our fellow-men, and many other con&s;iderations, too many now to &s;pecify, all recommend the careful u&s;e of the means of grace and &s;alvation, and a life of piety and virtue in this world. In this
<PB N="273" REF="030609_0272_0FE82ED883D7C3C0">
of piety and virtue in this world. In this way of &s;aving &s;inners, God manife&s;ts his infinite wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s in laying out for rational creatures and moral agents, work adapted to their rational, moral na|tures, and full of comfort, plea&s;ure, and joy. Salvation, however, was not appoint|ed for the means of it; but the means, for eternal &s;alvation, which was eternally made &s;ure, in the covenant of redemption, to that race of beings who&s;e &s;in the Lamb of God came to take away.</P>
<P>IT has ever been the &s;en&s;e of the mo&s;t en|lightened part of chri&s;tians, that the doctrine of election, and of the certain per&s;everance of believers, were doctrines tending to en|gage them the more in the u&s;e of means. The doctrine of election, as I have defined it, hath a greater influence of the &s;ame kind, as it di&s;plays a more exten&s;ive love of God to men, and gives us more enlarged views of free grace, and makes poor &s;inners more dependent on God in every view.</P>
<P>IF this doctrine does indeed take hold of our &s;ouls, oh! what a &s;acrifice of love &s;hall we offer to God, even our whole &s;ouls and bodies! How &s;hall we love God and all his creatures for his &s;ake! How &s;hall we love our dear Savior, and all for whom he died, for his &s;ake, whether to us friends or enemies, known or unknown, Jews or gentiles, bar|barians, Scythians, bond or free! Je&s;us hath died for them all; he loves them all; and he will bring them all into his kingdom. He will reconcile the world to him&s;elf,
<PB N="274" REF="030609_0273_0FE82F1250F10170">
not imputing iniquity. The ends of the earth &s;hall look unto him and be &s;aved.</P>
<P>IT is another token of true go&s;pel faith, and truly evangelical principles, that, in the exerci&s;e of them, good people find them|&s;elves happy in their own lot, and are not unea&s;y or envious towards others.</P>
<P>WHOEVER has that &s;en&s;e of the word of God. which I maintain, will enjoy this hap|pine&s;s. They are quite Willing that all mankind &s;hould enjoy every favor and ble&s;&s;|ing God is plea&s;ed to be&s;tow. They delight in the gracious communications of God, every where. If the friends of God have many ble&s;&s;ings, they delight therein; and if they that at pre&s;ent know not God, a|bound in outward good things, they delight in God's mercy thus far towards them. They would by no means exchange their own en|joyments, whatever their circum&s;tances may be in worldly things, for all the enjoyments of tho&s;e in a &s;tate of darkne&s;s, and igno|rance of the great &s;alvation. They well know that their real happine&s;s is as much greater than that of the unrenewed, as are the manife&s;tations of divine light and love to their &s;ouls. They feel them&s;elves hap|py in the knowledge of God and Je&s;us Chri&s;t. This is life and heaven to their &s;ouls. Their acquaintance with God is perfect peace. Their &s;en&s;e of the &s;ure, final mercy of God to all men, whom indeed they ardently love, does much add to their con&s;olation. One that loves and pities all &s;inners, as the go&s;|pel
<PB N="275" REF="030609_0274_0FE82EA0AA08FC80">
requires, and as all that have a go&s;pel &s;pirit do, <HI>cannot</HI> feel &s;o happy in a per&s;ua|&s;ion that mo&s;t of them will be eternally damned, as they do, who believe that "God will have all men to be &s;aved."</P>
<P>THEY who have that &s;en&s;e of God and &s;al|vation which I plead for, are exceeding happy at all times, in &s;uch a God and &s;uch a &s;alvation. Indeed their &s;ouls de&s;ire no more. "Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I de&s;ire be&s;ides thee." Such well know that godli|ne&s;s carries its own comfort along with it, even in the pre&s;ent world, having promi&s;e of the life that now is, as well as that which is to come. I am very confident in af|firming, that they who know God and his &s;alvation, in the light I have repre&s;ented, will be filled with exceeding joy, and will envy no per&s;on on earth; but will rejoice in all the good that any enjoy. If this be the effect of the&s;e doctrines wrought in the heart, they are doubtle&s;s according to god|line&s;s.</P>
<P>I AM very &s;en&s;ible no man will, or ever can fully and cordially believe in &s;uch a cha|racter of God, and &s;uch a &s;alvation, with|out the &s;pecial energy of divine power and grace, which is fitly called regeneration. Others may have a doctrinal belief of the&s;e things, in &s;ome &s;en&s;e; but to feel the reality of the&s;e glorious truths in the &s;oul, requires a &s;upernatural work on hearts &s;o di&s;affected to God as ours are in a natural &s;tate. We judge of God's feelings towards us, by ours
<PB N="276" REF="030609_0275_0FE82EDA0C75E930">
towards him, as all natural men do. There|fore, none but new creatures, can believe &s;uch glorious, a&s;toni&s;hing truths as the&s;e, with all their hearts, without he&s;itation, and with joy and peace in believing. No man can be fully &s;atisfied with this doctrine, until God has created in his &s;oul a friend&s;hip towards him&s;elf. When he knows by experience that he loves God, he will believe that God can love &s;inners freely. They that truly know God, have a very different &s;en&s;e of the love of God, from that of a blind world, who&s;e eyes are fa&s;t clo&s;ed in infidelity.</P>
<P>THESE thoughts, moreover, lead us to &s;ee the great duty, and propriety of &s;upport|ing, and maintaining go&s;pel ordinances and in&s;titutions in the world, and giving all due encouragement to the be&s;t in&s;tructors in the way of &s;alvation, that we can obtain, whe|ther God hath been plea&s;ed to enlighten them more or le&s;s. The ble&s;&s;ing of &s;uch in&s;truc|tion and ordinances is great in every view, temporal and &s;piritual. This is God's wi&s;e and merciful way to make us know the things freely given us of God, and to give us great pre&s;ent comfort in the&s;e things, and glorious hopes of eternal, con&s;ummate hap|pine&s;s in the life to come. No other plan of religion can ever &s;o much animate a peo|ple, to attend the wor&s;hip and ordinances of God, to hallow his &s;abbaths, and reverence his &s;anctuary, and to love their &s;piritual guides mo&s;t cordially, and account them worthy of double honor, for their works &s;ake, e&s;pecially tho&s;e who labor in word and
<PB N="277" REF="030609_0276_0FE82EDF966A4418">
doctrine. In a word, the&s;e principles, if they really take hold of the heart, will have every happy effect that the go&s;pel requires of us.</P>
<P>AGAIN; It is an evidence of true, go&s;|pel doctrine, if, when cordially believed, it will make us willing and joyful that God &s;hould be at the head of the univer&s;e, <HI>al|mighty, ab&s;olute Sovereign in all things, God over all, ble&s;&s;ed forevermore;</HI> al&s;o if it make creatures willing to keep <HI>their own</HI> proper place, at the feet of JEHOVAH, and rejoice to be ab&s;olutely dependent on &s;uch a God, and at his ab&s;olute, &s;overeign di&s;po&s;al for|ever and ever.</P>
<P>THIS idea of God, and this under&s;tand|ing of his word, will have &s;uch a ble&s;&s;ed ef|fect on every believing &s;oul. We &s;hall &s;ee clearly, that JEHOVAH is <HI>by nature</HI> God, and worthy to be God over all; and we &s;hall exceedingly rejoice that we, and all crea|tures are in his hands, as the clay in the hands of the potter. We can tru&s;t him with as much joy, as &s;afety. And we &s;ee, that all the world may well rejoice in his ab&s;olute, &s;overeign rule. Then we &s;hall break out in raptures of holy joy, "The Lord reigneth, let the earth rejoice, let the multitude of the i&s;les be glad thereof." Then we &s;hall cry out with unfeigned lips, "Prai&s;e the Lord all his works, in all places of his do|minion: Ble&s;s the Lord, O my &s;oul." When God hath given &s;ouls this under|&s;tanding to know the truth, they will ex|ceedingly
<PB N="278" REF="030609_0277_0FE82FC14CBB0C68">
rejoice that God is what he is, and that they are his creatures, in the proper relation of creatures; that is, in a &s;tate of intire, ab&s;olute, and everla&s;ting dependence on &s;uch a being as JEHOVAH.</P>
<P>THE <HI>limitarian</HI> &s;cheme never can have this operation on our &s;ouls. God him&s;elf has fixed his own laws, in our &s;ouls, that ab&s;o|lutely forbid it. <HI>The law of nature is as re|ally and truly the law of God, as the written word.</HI> Tho&s;e natural and inevitable feel|ings, which are common to all rational crea|tures, whether holy or &s;inful, whether an|gels or men, or of whatever rank or de&s;|cription, are indeed the laws of God. The whole law of nature is the law of JEHOVAH, the Author of nature; and a pure law too. By this law of God, he has made it forever ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible that any creature &s;hould cordially, without any aver&s;ion of &s;oul, freely con&s;ent to be forever and ever in the mo&s;t inexpre&s;&s;ible pain and torment. God's law of nature cries out again&s;t it, with all the authority of the divine Being him&s;elf. Much le&s;s can any holy &s;oul be willing to be an eternal &s;inner, an everla&s;t|ing enemy to God, which is the grand, e&s;&s;en|tial thing in that hell the <HI>limitarians</HI> plead for.</P>
<P>GOD does not &s;et his own laws in oppo&s;i|tion to one another. He does not, by one law, call upon us to avoid pain and mi&s;ery as much as we can, and by another bid us be plea&s;ed with it. Much le&s;s does he, by one law, command us to be holy and love
<PB N="279" REF="030609_0278_0FE82FC5DFF7DE50">
him &s;upremely, and &s;erve him in all holy and perfect obedience, and, by another law, command us to be quite willing to hate and rebel again&s;t him to all eternity. For us to obey two laws directly oppo&s;ite, is as im|po&s;&s;ible as to &s;erve two oppo&s;ite ma&s;ters. But on the plan which I &s;upport, we may, if our hearts are right, keep all the laws of God in glorious harmony, and find that, in keeping them there is great re|ward.</P>
<P>THE <HI>limitarians</HI> do indeed tell us, that all, under their eternal decree of reproba|tion, ought finally to be willing to be dam|ned. Many of them &s;ay, that every man mu&s;t be brought to this willingne&s;s, before he can be &s;aved!! God grant them further light, that they may better under&s;tand his nature, character, and wi&s;e, harmonious laws.</P>
<P>ON the pre&s;ent plan, I can will all that God wills, and do all that God bids me, if my heart is right, and that with great alacrity and joy. I am willing to keep <HI>my own place,</HI> as a creature of God, and I re|joice that my God will forever keep HIS, that JEHOVAH will &s;it on the throne of ab|&s;olute, univer&s;al government to all eternity. I rejoice that he doeth his plea&s;ure in the ar|mies of heaven and among the inhabitants of the world, that none can &s;tay his hand, neither may any &s;ay unto him what doe&s;t thou? I want no &s;ecurity but what I have in the nature and character of God, as di&s;|played in his works and word, through his

own Son, the brightne&s;s of his glory, and the expre&s;s image of his per&s;on.</P>
<P>I THINK tho&s;e principles cannot be wrong that have this native effect on the &s;oul; nor tho&s;e right, which require of us oppo&s;ite things and ab&s;olute impo&s;&s;ibilities.</P>
<P>I HAVE before ob&s;erved, that per&s;onal damnation in hell, is not once a&s;&s;erted in the bible, of any particular per&s;on; nor a word of that nature &s;aid, but what, agreeable to the whole genius and tenor of divine reve|lation, points to a &s;ub&s;titute. I add, in this place, that no &s;uch thing is &s;aid even of Judas him&s;elf; though, as the engli&s;h words &s;tand, in our tran&s;lation, there is more that &s;eems to favor &s;uch a tenet, than in any other pa&s;&s;age of &s;acred writ.</P>
<P>IN our engli&s;h bible we have the words thus, "It had been good for that man if he had not been born." Mat. xxvi. 24. and, in Mark xiv. 21. "Good were it for that man if he had never been born." Now if this tran&s;lation were ever &s;o exact and literal, it would by no means overthrow the ge|neral tenor of rea&s;oning from the nature and word of God, which we have been led into. It might, without any unrea&s;onable &s;train|ing of words, be under&s;tood, only as one of the many awful denunciations we have of the voice of ju&s;tice, all &s;ilenced and &s;a|tisfied in the great &s;urety. I appeal, how|ever, to every learned reader, that the tran&s;lation of the&s;e words is not ju&s;t, nor grammatical. The following words are ex|actly
<PB N="281" REF="030609_0280_0FE82FC84B6F5288">
literal and grammatical. "<HI>Good were it for him, if he had not been born that man,</HI>" or &s;uch a man.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> Much better in|deed, had it been for Judas if he had not been born &s;uch a prodigy of wickedne&s;s. So much the divine &s;pirit &s;ays. But by no means, &s;ays that Judas, or any other man, &s;hall be a lo&s;er by exi&s;tence, on the whole. This I notice by the way <HI>as ju&s;t,</HI> though not e&s;&s;ential to the grand argument.</P>
<P>IT is al&s;o evident that we have a right under&s;tanding of the character of God and his word, if we are thence affected with holy fear and trembling, mixed with holy joy and engagedne&s;s of heart to &s;erve God.</P>
<P>THIS &s;en&s;e of God and &s;alvation, now maintained, hath certainly &s;uch an effect on the &s;oul. To think of &s;uch a God, who&s;e ab&s;olute property we are: To con&s;ider what &s;inners we indeed are, and how ju&s;tly de&s;erving of his awful wrath and vengeance to all eternity: And that we can do nothing to help our&s;elves, and no creature can help us: That all our hope originates from the nature and &s;overeign purpo&s;e, and decree of God, utterly contrary to all our de&s;erts: To think what we mu&s;t be to all eternity, if ju&s;tice &s;hould only take place upon us, (and let God do what he will with us, we can never
<PB N="282" REF="030609_0281_0FE82FCF86C9EA40">
open our mouths with any charge of inju&s;|tice on the ab&s;olute Proprietor of all things) this will fill our whole &s;ouls with fear and trembling. Al&s;o, to find the nature and di&s;po&s;ition of the great and terrible God &s;o di&s;played in his word, as to &s;ee that <HI>this,</HI> and <HI>this</HI> alone, is our full and everla&s;ting &s;ecurity: That our everla&s;ting &s;afety lies in the nature of the great God, and no where el&s;e: This I &s;ay, will fill us with exceeding joy, and engage us earne&s;tly in all the means of &s;alvation, which &s;uch a great and glorious God hath appointed. Knowing that this awful and endearing JEHOVAH &s;aves, <HI>only in his own way;</HI> how thankful &s;hall we be that he has told us the way, and mar|ked out the path! Mo&s;t certainly, this will make us work out our own &s;alvation with fear and trembling. We &s;hall indeed &s;erve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with tremb|ling.</P>
<P>NO view we can have of the way of &s;al|vation, but this, will affect us with that un|di&s;&s;embled, unfeigned humility, which the go&s;pel requires. But this will make us e&s;|teem others better than our&s;elves, and that without any compliment at all; not only &s;ome others, but, in the natural &s;en&s;e of the phra&s;e, others in the general view.</P>
<P>EVERY man that feels the truth and force of this doctrine, will really feel and know that he is wor&s;e than other men, yea, than any other man that ever had exi&s;tence; be|cau&s;e he knows &s;o much more of him&s;elf
<PB N="283" REF="030609_0282_0FE82EB225A0D000">
than of any other man; al&s;o, becau&s;e the belief of this doctrine is attended with real, go&s;pel charity towards all men, even that charity which hopeth all things. Such a &s;en&s;e of God and &s;alvation, and &s;uch a view of him&s;elf, will make any man cry out, in the utmo&s;t &s;incerity, and without &s;o much as the &s;hadow of a compliment, &s;urely I am more bruti&s;h than any man: I have not the under&s;tanding of a man: I neither learned wi&s;dom, nor have the knowledge of the holy: I abhor my&s;elf and repent in du&s;t and a&s;hes.</P>
<P>SUCH indeed is the very nature of all mankind, that, while they build their confi|dence of God's eternal favor, on good marks, and good di&s;tinctions in them&s;elves; and thence conclude they &s;hall be &s;aved and mo&s;t others damned, it will feed their pride, and puff their &s;ouls up with haughti|ne&s;s. They may &s;ay what they plea&s;e, of <HI>"mere grace," "mere favor," "free grace," "free favor:"</HI> Not the le&s;s proud will they be for all this; but quite the rever&s;e.</P>
<P>NOTHING in the univer&s;e hath a more powerful operation on human &s;ouls, to make them proud, than that great, exalted, renowned per&s;onages have &s;ingled them out as &s;pecial favorites. A full confi|dence that the infinitely exalted JEHO|VAH hath done it, will make every man, while in this world, feel ju&s;t as the phari|&s;ee did, when moved by the &s;ame inward &s;entiment. Merely a &s;en&s;e of the greate&s;t favors will make no man proud; but bring in the idea of compari&s;on and di&s;tinction,
<PB N="284" REF="030609_0283_0FE82F17CA360380">
and it will make every man &s;o, while under the moral infirmities of nature which attend us in the pre&s;ent world. But on my plea, every valley is filled, and every mountain and hill is brought low, and the crooked is made &s;trait, and the rough places plain, and the Lord alone is exalted. This will bring down every high thought and imagination, that exalteth it&s;elf again&s;t the knowledge of Chri&s;t, and bring all into &s;ubjection to the obedience of faith.</P>
<P>IT is very natural for many to make infe|rences, and draw con&s;equences from what is &s;aid concerning the &s;alvation of mankind, and apply the &s;ame to other ranks and or|ders of beings, which we know little, or nothing about.</P>
<P>THUS, they apply the&s;e doctrines to the ca&s;e of the mi&s;erable, fallen angels. I think we proceed upon very uncertain ground, in all &s;uch rea&s;onings and applications. God has been plea&s;ed to acquaint us a little, and but a very little, with any other intelligent creatures, whether holy or unholy, but tho&s;e of our own rank and order, our fellow men. Yet, as it does, in certain re&s;pects, concern our duty and practice in this world, to know &s;omething of holy angels, and al&s;o of evil angels, we are made &s;o far acquainted with their re&s;pective di&s;po&s;itions and circum&s;tances as relates to our practice, and no farther.</P>
<P>WE are taught, that many of the angels have been very &s;inful and very mi&s;erable a
<PB N="285" REF="030609_0284_0FE82FD10F2BF110">
great while, and that they are very a&s;&s;idu|ous, crafty, and malicious to oppo&s;e the happine&s;s of the human race, and promote all the &s;in and mi&s;ery they can. We are told that the holy angels are of a direct con|trary di&s;po&s;ition and character. And we are taught, in the word of God, how to con|duct our&s;elves relative to both. This is as much as God hath &s;een fit to reveal to us on this &s;ubject. I have often thought, that the immode&s;ty of mankind is as much di&s;|covered in many po&s;itive a&s;&s;ertions about the angels, as in any one thing.</P>
<P>THIS, however, I &s;uppo&s;e we may &s;ay concerning the mi&s;erable, condemned an|gels, that they are as great &s;inners, as we by nature are, in proportion to the quantity of being they po&s;&s;e&s;s; and greater &s;inners than we are by nature, only in con&s;ideration that they are of an higher rank than we, and have a greater mea&s;ure of exi&s;tence; but le&s;s &s;inners than we in one very capital view. For they have not &s;inned again&s;t a KINSMAN REDEEMER, and the proclama|tions of &s;uch a go&s;pel as we have de&s;pi&s;ed.</P>
<P>WE may al&s;o &s;ay, that even to this day (for ought we know) they have as much cau&s;e of eternal de&s;pair as the human kind once had, during the &s;pace between the mo|ment of our original rebellion, and the fir&s;t intimation of a Savior: That they ju&s;tly de&s;erve endle&s;s damnation, by the very na|ture of their criminality, as well as we: And that they will certainly be eternally damned, in the voice of ju&s;tice, and we
<PB N="286" REF="030609_0285_0FE82FD761C003C0">
know of no declaration of grace that relates to them, any more than the human kind once did, with regard to mi&s;erable, <HI>damned,</HI> or <HI>condemned</HI> &s;inners, of our own order.</P>
<P>WE may further &s;ay, that God can cer|tainly do them no wrong, any more than he can us. If their mi&s;ery is endle&s;s, or if ours had been &s;o; the will of God is nece&s;&s;arily ju&s;t, and the only &s;tandard of all ju&s;tice and righteou&s;ne&s;s, for this grand, all im|portant rea&s;on, which I would not &s;o often repeat, were it not of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence that it &s;hould &s;ink deep into our &s;ouls and never be unthought of, viz. his ab&s;olute, underived, univer&s;al, and everla&s;ting pro|perty in all things.</P>
<P>IF we &s;ay more than the above, I appre|hend, we do no honor thereby to our profe&s;|&s;ion of go&s;pel humility: Or rather, that we tran&s;gre&s;s in exerci&s;ing our&s;elves in great matters, or things too high for us, that we know not; and darken coun&s;el by words without knowledge. Who can &s;ay that the &s;ame God who found a way for our recove|ry, can find none for theirs, throughout an interminable eternity? Or who can &s;ay, that even our own all-&s;ufficient Savior will not, in &s;ome way, unknown to us at pre|&s;ent, be found hereafter the Head of ALL principalities and powers, in a more graci|ous &s;en&s;e than we have imagined, even in an infinitely merciful &s;en&s;e to the father, the devil, as well as to his children? Who can &s;ay that a Savior, of &s;uch un&s;earchable riches of grace, &s;uch boundle&s;s wi&s;dom and
<PB N="287" REF="030609_0286_0FE82FD8E8408508">
power, will not, in his own way and time, make every knee bow to him, in one and the &s;ame &s;en&s;e, and every tongue confe&s;s, from one and the &s;ame &s;pirit, that he is Lord of all to the glory of God the Father? Who can &s;ay that God will not, in &s;ome future period of endle&s;s duration, <HI>gather together in</HI> ONE, ALL <HI>things in Chri&s;t, both in heaven and on earth and under the earth,</HI> in the mo&s;t plain and &s;imple under&s;tanding of the terms? Who can &s;ay, that he will never wholly con|quer death, though it be the la&s;t enemy, and &s;hall &s;urvive every other conque&s;t of his; even death, in the mo&s;t common, &s;crip|ture &s;en&s;e of the word, including &s;piritual death, which includes all &s;infulne&s;s, as well as natural death?</P>
<P>WHO can &s;ay, that the greate&s;t &s;ufferers, and tho&s;e who are thrown into the greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s and horror, &s;ave ONE, &s;hall be on the whole lo&s;ers by their having been cal|led into being, by the almighty power of God, who is love? Since it is certain that the greate&s;t of all &s;ufferers, and he who, in a legal view, was ju&s;tly charged with the greate&s;t guilt, is the greate&s;t gainer of all creatures by his exi&s;tence. I here &s;peak ju&s;t as our mo&s;t enlightened, and mo&s;t or|thodox divines have always &s;poken. They all agree in the perfect holine&s;s and purity of the man Chri&s;t Je&s;us, in a per&s;onal &s;en&s;e; yet, in a vicarious &s;en&s;e, and as by the co|venant of redemption he &s;tood related to the divine law, they all agree, he was ju&s;t|ly charged with the greate&s;t guilt of any
<PB N="288" REF="030609_0287_0FE82FDF403C45B0">
creature that ever God made, even the &s;ins of the whole world. As he &s;tood related to pain and puni&s;hment he never had an equal. And this is the great, e&s;&s;ential, capital doc|trine of divine revelation, whereby the bible is mo&s;t of all di&s;tingui&s;hed from all other books. I &s;ay &s;ince this greate&s;t of all &s;uf|ferers, on account of &s;in, is the greate&s;t gainer of all the creatures of God by his exi&s;tence, on the whole, who can &s;ay God cannot deal in a &s;imilar way with all who &s;uffer on account of &s;in? For whether you are an original debtor, or a &s;urety, there is no difference as to your ju&s;t obligation to pay the debt.</P>
<P>ARE we not rather immode&s;t and arro|gant, when we po&s;itively affirm, that we certainly know, God has called into exi&s;t|ence innumerable myriads of intelligent creatures to be extremely mi&s;erable, to end|le&s;s duration, under his own fixed eternal decree? God indeed &s;aw it be&s;t, on the whole, that much evil &s;hould take place, both moral and natural; otherwi&s;e he certain|ly would have hindered it. But who can &s;ay that God him&s;elf, with all his wi&s;dom, power and love, is not able to an&s;wer all the wi&s;e, good, and glorious purpo&s;es he de&s;igned, by the exi&s;tence of all evil, moral and natural; yet &s;o as to leave not one of his offspring a lo&s;er by exi&s;tence?</P>
<P>AS to the man Je&s;us Chri&s;t, he had ten thou&s;and times more guilt to an&s;wer for, than any other man in the world, and no doubt more than any mi&s;erable, fallen angel.
<PB N="289" REF="030609_0288_0FE82EE8A5187D90">
And he was ju&s;t as much obligated to &s;uffer pain, mi&s;ery, and puni&s;hment, as if it had been per&s;onal; yet that man Chri&s;t Je&s;us is, on the whole, the mo&s;t dignified and happy creature that ever God made. "Be|ing found in fa&s;hion as a man, he humbled him&s;elf and became obedient to death, even the death of the cro&s;s; wherefore God al&s;o hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: That at the name of Je&s;us, every knee &s;hould bow, of things in heaven and things in the earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue &s;hould confe&s;s, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is Lord, to the glory of God the Father." Phili. ii. 8, &amp;c. "For the joy &s;et before him, he endured the cro&s;s, de&s;pi&s;ing the &s;hame, and is &s;et down at the right hand of the throne of God."</P>
<P>DO we know enough about the extent of divine wi&s;dom, power and love, to affirm that mo&s;t, or even any of God's own off|&s;pring &s;hall be infinite lo&s;ers by exi&s;tence ir|re&s;i&s;tibly forced upon them, by the infinite|ly kind Fountain of all being and ble&s;&s;ed|ne&s;s? When we get &s;o far beyond our line in rea&s;oning, we tread on very uncertain ground. Let us then let the fallen angels alone. But if any of us mu&s;t needs en|quire more about the eternal fate of the angels that fell; it is well for us to remem|ber that they are our &s;uperiors, in the &s;cale of creation, and &s;tand related to us as the offspring of the great, common Fountain of

being; and are no wor&s;e than we in their temper and di&s;po&s;ition, only as no mediator hath operated on their minds, as upon ours, in a way of re&s;traint, or by any kind, or gracious operation, as upon the human kind ever &s;ince the fall.</P>
<P>CHILDREN are to hate their father the devil, only as they are to hate their natural parents and all their fellow men, and even them&s;elves. <HI>Not with per&s;onal hatred; not with feelings of malevolence; not as creatures of God;</HI> but all in them morally evil in its own nature, all that is oppo&s;ite to the moral nature or character of the common Fountain of being. Thus we are to hate father and mother, wife and children, brethren and &s;i&s;ters, yea, and our own life al&s;o; and thus, and in no other way, we ought to hate every thing in which moral evil appears. But if we feel any ma|levolence towards the devil, as a creature of God, or wi&s;h him evil; we feel towards him as he does towards us, and &s;hew his moral likene&s;s in this our malevolence, as might be expected from devils only. If we wi&s;h the fallen angels may all remain eter|nally damned, and that the common Parent of all may never di&s;play and glorify his great name in their deliverance, from enmi|ty, &s;in and pain, even if he is able to do it; if we heartily wi&s;h they may be the objects of almighty vengeance to endle&s;s duration, then, <HI>we feel towards them, as they do towards us.</HI></P>
<P>IF our natural parents are very wicked, and, by nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equences, very mi&s;e|rable,
<PB N="291" REF="030609_0290_0FE82F2A367C2A78">
we do well to wi&s;h, that God, of his infinite power and grace, would make them better and happier. We know he can do it, if he plea&s;es. And &s;ince we know not, but that infinite wi&s;dom, power, and mercy can, if God plea&s;e, take hold of our infernal pa|rents; we &s;hew a &s;pirit too much like theirs, in wi&s;hing they may continue to endle&s;s du|ration, in all their &s;ins and in all their tor|ments. It is certain the great JEHOVAH may, in pure ju&s;tice, leave them &s;o forever; the very nature of their &s;infulne&s;s does merit this, by every rule of pure righteou&s;|ne&s;s, without any con&s;ideration in the uni|ver&s;e &s;eparate from the very nature of &s;in. And God might have left us in like manner, and in the like pure ju&s;tice. But, for my part, I am quite willing God &s;hould make me holy and happy, for the glory of his own name, and all my fellow &s;inners without ex|ception, if he plea&s;e. I am willing the Lord &s;hould be thus "<HI>good unto</HI> ALL," and his tender mercies thus be over all his works, which are capable of holine&s;s and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>IF we knew our&s;elves better than we do, we &s;hould not look upon our&s;elves, by na|ture, &s;o unlike to the fallen angels as we are apt to imagine.

<P><PB N="292" REF="030609_0291_0FE82E7A66CAA618">AND now, to take up another thought, I apprehend that the way of &s;alvation I am defending, has this further mark of truth. <HI>It exhibits God to our view, as conducting the affairs of our &s;alvation analogous to all his other conduct.</HI></P>
<P>THE all-wi&s;e and good God does influ|ence, move, and govern all his creatures, in a way &s;uitable to the natures and faculties he hath given them. This is to be &s;een every where, and in every thing. With regard to all our temporal enjoyments, though they are the objects of his eternal decree, made eternally &s;ure in his all-glorious, immutable plan; yet he gives us all the&s;e things, in a way &s;uitable to our natures, as rational crea|tures and free moral agents, by the exerci&s;e of our minds and bodies, that we may have, at all times, proper exerci&s;e; for this is wholly nece&s;&s;ary to our felicity. This is all the rea&s;on why God does not give us all our food immediately fit for eating, and all our raiment ready to put on: If he did &s;o, we &s;hould be without that exertion and em|ployment &s;uited to our natures as active creatures, and nece&s;&s;ary to our comfort. Therefore, though our exertions are requir|ed, it is not to make the&s;e enjoyments more &s;ure to us, than he could have otherwi&s;e made them, or than even his eternal decree made them. It is ju&s;t &s;o with regard to our &s;alvation. The means are all laid out for us, and enjoined upon us, and connected with the end, ju&s;t as much as in all temporal things, only becau&s;e this gives proper exer|ci&s;e
<PB N="293" REF="030609_0292_0FE7EC33F4164638">
to the immortal &s;oul, attended with un|&s;peakable plea&s;ure and delight; and is &s;uited to our rational natures, and the rela|tion we &s;tand in to God. Our working out our own &s;alvation, is only a rea&s;onable du|ty, not preceding the certainty of it, in God's view; but following as a fit and hap|py <HI>con&s;equence,</HI> in his eternal plan, and in the order of his communication of ble&s;&s;edne&s;s made &s;ure before the foundation of the world.</P>
<P>SO there is every rea&s;on, and all manner of fitne&s;s, that we &s;hould inculcate upon all mankind, the u&s;e of the means of grace and &s;alvation, that can po&s;&s;ibly be in any ca&s;e in the univer&s;e. It is our rea&s;onable, fit, and happy &s;ervice, and not only with re|gard to all the powers of our &s;ouls, but of the whole man, even our bodies al&s;o. Hence did Paul &s;ay, "I be&s;eech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye pre&s;ent your bodies a living &s;acrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your rea&s;ona|ble &s;ervice." Rom. xii.</P>
<P>IT is proper to &s;ay, in every ca&s;e in the univer&s;e, and in every ca&s;e alike true, that the actions and exertions of creatures never alter the previous and eternal certainty of any thing; neither did God de&s;ign them for any &s;uch end, or with any &s;uch view. God has ordered and commanded all the duties that are to be done by all his crea|tures, to carry into effect, and to accompli&s;h his own fixed, good and merciful decrees, in the only fit way, that is, in a way &s;uited to
<PB N="294" REF="030609_0293_0FE82EA2314046C0">
the natures he has given them, and in cer|tain connection with the end. All the&s;e are in the immutable univer&s;al &s;y&s;tem, as much as the end. Hence we &s;ee the great propriety of God's encouragements and pro|mi&s;es to the virtuous and obedient; and of his threatnings to the vicious and rebellious. They are all &s;uited to the nature of man. And hence we &s;ee how fit it is, that obedi|ence and virtue &s;hould be attended with de|light and joy, as it always is; and that all &s;in &s;hould be attended, or rebuked with pain and &s;orrow, which never fails to be the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>THEY, whom God has &s;et up in this world to rule and govern mankind, &s;hould, under him, enact good and whole&s;ome laws, in favor of all virtue, and good conduct; and in terrible oppo&s;ition to all wickedne&s;s, all that oppo&s;eth the nature of God, and the good and happine&s;s of the creatures of God. This is exceeding fit and proper among men, wi&s;ely adapted to their natures. The Mo&s;t High, no doubt, could &s;uppre&s;s vice and in|iquity in &s;ome other way; but none appears to us &s;o well adapted to the natures of men. Hence there is every rea&s;on for rulers and ruled, to unite in the mo&s;t vigorous efforts for the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible civil government.</P>
<P>THIS view of the way of God, and this under&s;tanding of his revealed will, is &s;up|ported, in that it opens to our &s;ight another grand doctrine of revelation. Which is, <HI>the amazing unrea&s;onablene&s;s of &s;in, and &s;in|ners;
<PB N="295" REF="030609_0294_0FE82EA6CAE189A8">
and how they will pervert all truth and rea&s;on, to the vile&s;t purpo&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>MANY will &s;ay, if all the&s;e things are &s;o, if all things, all events, are eternally made certain; men and devils are not to blame for their &s;ins: Ju&s;t as though the blame of &s;in did not lie in the nature of it. Many will &s;ay, if &s;alvation is finally &s;ecured, as here repre&s;ented, then it is very eligible for men to indulge all their lu&s;ts in this world, and live in all manner of vice, as they plea&s;e: Ju&s;t as though vice and wickedne&s;s were attended with happine&s;s: Not con|&s;idering, that perfection of wickedne&s;s, with its in&s;eparable connections, does in very deed, make the whole hell that the <HI>limitari|ans</HI> plead for; or that rectitude and virtue in its perfection, does, in very deed, make the heavenly happine&s;s we hope for. They are &s;o blind and unrea&s;onable, as not to &s;ee that if &s;infulne&s;s, or hell, which are for &s;ub|&s;tance the &s;ame thing, are not hateful and horrible in this world, they cannot be here|after; and that if virtue, holine&s;s, or heaven, which are e&s;&s;entially the &s;ame thing, are not de&s;irable in this world, they cannot be in the world to come.</P>
<P>THIS plan, moreover, helps us to the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible &s;olution of the que&s;tion, which &s;o often ari&s;es among men. <HI>Why did God ever bring moral evil into his eternal plan, or &s;uffer it to exi&s;t?</HI> For, upon this plan, we &s;ee that God doth &s;o di&s;play and exerci&s;e his own perfections, in oppo&s;ing the nature of &s;in
<PB N="296" REF="030609_0295_0FE82E909F023F68">
and <HI>its effects,</HI> as we cannot &s;ee he otherwi&s;e might have done. And we al&s;o find many exerci&s;es of mind; many employments and efforts laid out for his rational creatures, in oppo&s;ing &s;in and its awful attendants and con&s;equences, in obedience to God; and much exerci&s;e of humility, and thankfulne&s;s, and all graces which we can &s;ee no room for, had God's eternal plan been otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>THIS doctrine is further &s;upported, by the doctrine of God's unlimited wi&s;dom and power.</P>
<P>ALL will allow, that if all the good ends could have been an&s;wered and accompli&s;hed, without the eternal mi&s;ery of a multitude of mankind, then it had been better, and then God would have cho&s;en it; becau&s;e all grant, that &s;uch mi&s;ery is, in its nature, a great evil, and very unde&s;irable, yea very horrible. To &s;uppo&s;e that God could not have an&s;wered all the&s;e glorious ends, with|out this eternal mi&s;ery of &s;o many creatures, is to &s;uppo&s;e that he was limited by the very nature of things; or that it could not, in the nature of things have been otherwi&s;e. But, pray, what is the nature of things? And whence does the nature of things origi|nate? Certainly from God and his attributes only. For in that period of duration when there was nothing exi&s;tent but God, where was the nature of things, or the nece&s;&s;ity of nature, but in God only?</P>
<P>TO &s;uppo&s;e there was any limitation up|on the eternal Being, when no other being
<PB N="297" REF="030609_0296_0FE82F30A14C0470">
did exi&s;t, is to &s;uppo&s;e that his own infinite, unlimited attributes did limit, and &s;et bounds to his conduct, or to the emanations of his infinite love and benevolence. It is to &s;ay, that God would have done better if he could; but that he could not: He acted out him&s;elf with as much kindne&s;s as he could, and wi&s;hed to have been more kind, had it been po&s;&s;ible, in the nature of things; that is, in the nature of his own perfections, which give nature to all things el&s;e: That his infinite wi&s;dom, power and love, could do no better than to exhibit a &s;y&s;tem glori|ous in the main; but at the expence of the unutterable, endle&s;s mi&s;ery of countle&s;s myriads of his own offspring. This lays a limitation on the Mo&s;t High, ari&s;ing from his own attributes; becau&s;e thence &s;lows the whole nature of things, as their nature can|not flow from non-entity.</P>
<P>BUT, a ju&s;t idea of the great God is this, he can indeed do all that the infinite good|ne&s;s of his heart is di&s;po&s;ed to do; and he never gave a nature to things to ob&s;truct the emanations of his love. "<HI>What his &s;oul de&s;ireth even that he doeth.</HI>"</P>
<P>THE <HI>limitarians</HI> &s;uppo&s;e God hath formed a &s;y&s;tem as full of happine&s;s as was po&s;&s;ible, and a glorious &s;y&s;tem on the whole. That he would have kept out of this &s;y&s;tem the eternal mi&s;ery of any creature, if he had been able; but was not able, through the nece&s;&s;ity of his own attributes, &s;o to do; therefore formed the be&s;t &s;y&s;tem he could.
<PB N="298" REF="030609_0297_0FE82FE0C7E79328">
A &s;y&s;tem much better than none, and even good on the whole, in a high degree. How does this corre&s;pond with ju&s;t conceptions of JEHOVAH, God Almighty, all-wi&s;e, and infinite love?</P>
<P>IT is in vain to &s;ay here, that this argu|ment would equally exclude out of the &s;y&s;|tem, all the moral and penal evil that ever did exi&s;t, or ever will. Becau&s;e, on the <HI>go&s;|pel plan,</HI> according to my &s;en&s;e of it, all the evil of every kind that hath exi&s;ted, or &s;hall exi&s;t, is real good in the whole connection; not only to the <HI>&s;y&s;tem in general,</HI> but to <HI>every individual</HI> in it, capable of rational happine&s;s. No one &s;hall be le&s;s happy, on the whole, than if no evil had ever taken place. Moral and natural evil never did, or &s;hall exi&s;t, at the expence (if I may &s;o &s;peak) of any one of the creatures of love, or of God who is love. Eternity is long enough, to make every creature as happy on the whole, as if there had never been any experience of evil of any kind; at lea&s;t, we can by no means prove the contrary. That &s;entiment of the poet has ever been admired&mdash;

<P>CREATURES may &s;uffer evil a great while, yet have as long duration before them to be happy in, as if they had never ta&s;ted of evil. To &s;ay that any duration of evil, or any de|gree of it, certainly, makes &s;ome deduction, and a proportionable deduction from our quantity of happine&s;s, though it may after|wards

commence and be endle&s;s thenceforth, is to &s;ay more than any creature can know; unle&s;s we can find a creature who compre|hends eternity and all things belonging to it. It is al&s;o &s;aying, what &s;tands in full oppo&s;i|tion to the common &s;en&s;e, and faith of the prote&s;tant world, in &s;everal other ca&s;es. Take only the following well known in|&s;tance in&s;tead of many.</P>
<P>WE all believe that the &s;aint that la&s;t goes to heaven, &s;hall have as great a reward of free grace, as the &s;aint that fir&s;t went thither; provided their moral characters are equal in this life. Of this we doubt not, and the &s;cripture is full to the purpo&s;e. We al&s;o agree in the opinion of the eternal, progre&s;|&s;ive happine&s;s of the &s;aints in heaven, and that they who went there &s;everal thou&s;and years ago, are far advanced in glory and ble&s;&s;edne&s;s beyond tho&s;e who go there at this day; and further &s;till before tho&s;e, who may go to heaven thou&s;ands of years hence. All this we believe, al&s;o, that all equal cha|racters &s;hall have an equal reward of glory in heaven, whether they live and die &s;ooner or later. "I will give unto this la&s;t even as unto thee:" "The fir&s;t &s;hall be la&s;t and the la&s;t &s;hall be fir&s;t:" i. e. all equal on the whole, if their moral characters and &s;ervices have been &s;o in this world. The&s;e are points not controverted among prote&s;t|ants. Yet it is ea&s;y to &s;ee, that the &s;ame ob|jection, if any, lies again&s;t this doctrine, as again&s;t what I have a&s;&s;erted, viz. that ex|perience of evil, for a given time, may be
<PB N="300" REF="030609_0299_0FE8302628FAC0D0">
con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;ame quantity of happi|ne&s;s in endle&s;s duration, as if the evil had never been &s;uffered.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Suppo&s;e a rational creature to exi&s;t any given period of time, more or le&s;s, in great mi&s;ery, and then, at the end of that certain period, to exi&s;t ju&s;t as much longer in as great plea&s;ure and happine&s;s, &s;o as exactly to counterbalance all his former pain and make him even on the whole, neither a gainer or lo&s;er by his exi&s;tence thus far. Then &s;uppo&s;e it to be the good will of his Maker, to continue him in being to endle&s;s duration, in a &s;tate of progre&s;&s;ive happine&s;s. Sup|po&s;e al&s;o, that it is the plea&s;ure of the Mo&s;t High to create another, of equal capacity, at the moment when the former has arrived at the end of the &s;econd period aforementioned, viz. at that moment when he is ju&s;t as well off, and no better than if he had never been created. Let the&s;e two beings ex|it thenceforward to endle&s;s duration, in equal degrees of progre&s;&s;ive happine&s;s, and it is ea&s;y to &s;ee that both, on the whole, &s;hall be ju&s;t alike happy, i. e. the former will be, at the moment of his counterbalance, in the &s;elf &s;ame predica|ment, in this re&s;pect, as if he had been created that very moment. So that it is evident enough, that if our uncon|troverted opinion, that all equal characters in this world &s;hall have equal happine&s;s in the eternal world, whether they are born &s;ooner or later, be true; then it is true, that a rational creature may &s;uffer great pains, for any given period of time, and yet be &s;o far from being a lo&s;er by exi&s;tence, that he may be ju&s;t as great a gainer thereby, on the whole, as any other creature of equal capacity who never ta&s;ted of any evil at all, and who hath his beginning of exi&s;tence in a later period of duration. I beg none would imagine from this re|mark, that I think the great JEHOVAH bound in ju&s;tice to re|pay any of his creatures for their pains, by an equal balance of happine&s;s. I have no idea of any &s;uch demand of the clay on the great Potter, or of any creature on his Maker. The will of JEHOVAH is nece&s;&s;arily ju&s;t, and the only criterion, rule and &s;tandard of all righteou&s;ne&s;s. Let men or angels be in whatever predicament they may, it is the will of God that hath placed them there, and they may not impeach their Maker of inju&s;tice, or by any means make on him a claim of reward. I only take refuge in the infinite &s;overeignty of the divine will, flowing out of the INFINITE GOODNESS OF THE DIVINE NATURE. To know what this is, I turn to all his works, and to his revealed will.</NOTE></P>
<P>I WOULD, indeed, never be po&s;itive, when I rea&s;on about infinity and eternity, which are incomprehen&s;ible to all beings, but God him&s;elf. And I only mention this in&s;tance,
<PB N="301" REF="030609_0300_0FE83027B070DD18">
as I might many more, to &s;hew, that the ob|jection I am refuting, is built on no certain foundation; and that in the fair application of it, it mu&s;t overthrow many articles of faith in which we are all well agreed, and bring into confu&s;ion the <HI>limitarian</HI> &s;cheme as well as any other adopted by chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>BUT it is plain, at fir&s;t view, that, if in|numerable of the offspring, of God, rational creatures which he hath called into being, or even any number of them, are in extreme &s;ufferings to endle&s;s duration, in that ca&s;e, they mu&s;t be infinite lo&s;ers by that exi&s;t|ence, which the God of love forced upon them. Yet even on this &s;uppo&s;ition we might not impeach the <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> and righteou&s;|ne&s;s of the ab&s;olute, &s;overeign Proprietor of all things. But, I would a&s;k my reader, is this your idea of the true character of the GOD OF LOVE, God who is love, even in the ab&s;tract; or of Chri&s;t, who &s;o loved the world, that he gave him&s;elf a ran&s;om for all?</P>
<P>IT may here be added. On the <HI>limitarian</HI> plan, they who are &s;aved will be &s;aved by their own works, being ju&s;tified by their own works, in Paul's &s;en&s;e of ju&s;tification by works, or in any other po&s;&s;ible &s;en&s;e in which we can conceive of any &s;uch ju&s;tifica|tion. Yea, <HI>they are &s;aved by their own merit, &s;o far as we can have any notion of merit in a creature.</HI></P>
<P>ALL the idea we can po&s;&s;ibly have of me|rit in creatures, or claim on the Deity by
<PB N="302" REF="030609_0301_0FE8302C485C32A0">
any good works, is the following: That there is &s;omething good in the creature, which God con&s;iders as a condition of his &s;alvation; and which in the order of nature, precedes his &s;ecurity of eternal life. The que&s;tion is not, whether we are wholly de|pendent on the free grace of God for all this good in us, and all the&s;e conditions and terms of ju&s;tification and &s;alvation? We all agree, that every creature is ab&s;olutely and entirely dependent on God, for all good of every kind, both inherent and external. If we con&s;ider any good in us, whether faith, repentance, holine&s;s, or any thing el&s;e, as a term or condition, previous to which, <HI>as a condition in God's view,</HI> he hath not made eternal life &s;ure to us; we arrogate to our|&s;elves all the claim of merit that can po&s;&s;i|bly enter into the proud heart of a &s;inner, and all that Paul &s;o much oppo&s;eth; we claim to our&s;elves every thing that man can po&s;&s;ibly boa&s;t of, unle&s;s we claim entire in|dependency of God, which no man ever pretended to.</P>
<P>TO &s;ay we have, indeed, certain good qua|lifications, and certain good di&s;tinctions, <HI>through grace,</HI> which give us claim to &s;alva|tion; is to &s;ay all that the proud phari&s;ees ever did &s;ay, and all that the proude&s;t man on earth ever did, or can &s;ay; even though we are ever &s;o ready to own, that God freely gave us all the&s;e good qualifications and di&s;|tinctions. But the feelings of a &s;oul are ex|ceedingly different, who con&s;iders &s;alvation made &s;ure to him, by God in Chri&s;t, under
<PB N="303" REF="030609_0302_0FE8302EAE8BE0D8">
the idea of a mo&s;t ungodly wretch, and without any di&s;tinction of good in him more than in any man on earth, or any fallen an|gel in hell; that God ju&s;tified him in Chri&s;t as <HI>ungodly,</HI> wholly &s;o, and then &s;ent him all the di&s;tinctions, all the qualifications of re|pentance, faith, &amp;c. merely in a way of ap|plication of that &s;alvation which, with God, was made &s;ure to him before the world be|gan.</P>
<P>IT is certain we can form no other idea of &s;alvation by works, or merit in a creature, than this, viz. That God, by his own free grace, hath made &s;ome good and valuable di&s;tinctions in that creature, hath freely be|&s;towed &s;ome good qualifications, making that creature better than &s;ome others; and then that God on that con&s;ideration, be&s;tows eternal life; and that the good he hath al|ready be&s;towed is a condition that binds him &s;o to do.</P>
<P>EVERY one who thinks he has got hold of a di&s;tingui&s;hing, or &s;pecial promi&s;e made under a condition, will readily acknowledge that it was wholly owing to the grace of God, that ever he come up to the condition. Faith, repentance, holine&s;s, and all tho&s;e things that are called terms and conditions of &s;alvation, are wholly of the free grace of God, as we all grant. Yet, all the&s;e are good works in the creature; yea, the chief, the capital of good works. Now, to &s;ay that we may plead our title to &s;alvation, as grounded on any of the&s;e, or all the&s;e, is only to offer the plaine&s;t and greate&s;t plea of
<PB N="304" REF="030609_0303_0FE8303428062B88">
merit in us, or of our own works, that any man ever did offer or rely upon. To own we had our qualifications, which we plead as conditions of the promi&s;es, from God, only in a way of mere grace, does not mi|litate in the lea&s;t again&s;t all the pride and confidence of our <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> merit&punc; but does ra|ther <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> it, as I <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;hewn before. The more di&s;tingui&s;hing notice we imagine God has taken of us, to make us better than other men, the more we &s;hall feel like the phari&s;ee in the temple. Indeed there is no &s;alvation, on the <HI>limitarian</HI> plan; but the &s;ame that was &s;o plea&s;ing to that devout phari&s;ee.</P>
<P>BUT, on the GOSPEL PLAN, the idea, and the feelings of the heart are quite different Chri&s;t alone is our &s;ecurity for eternal life, wholly di&s;tinct from all conditions or qua|lifications <HI>in us.</HI> Our hope is laid up in heaven. Je&s;us Chri&s;t is our life. He hath taken away the &s;in of the world, even before we knew any thing about it: And now, by his holy &s;pirit, &s;ends to us the means of &s;al|vation, and makes them operate effectually on our &s;ouls, to make us meet to be parta|kers of the inheritance of the &s;aints in light. He fir&s;t in&s;ures &s;alvation, and then makes the application of the benefit, in his own way; which is the only rea&s;onable and pro|per way, the only way adapted to the ra|tional natures he has given us. God looks on no terms, no conditions in poor &s;inners, however believing and penitent they are; nor on their inward holine&s;s, otherwi&s;e than
<PB N="305" REF="030609_0304_0FE8303776F79C08">
as fit gradations he him&s;elf is taking, to ap|ply to them that eternal &s;alvation which, <HI>with him,</HI> was equally &s;ure to them in their very wor&s;t e&s;tate. "If while we were ene|mies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son: Much more, being recon|ciled, we &s;hall be &s;aved by his life." Rom. v. 10. He that gave him&s;elf a ran&s;om for all, will take his own way and time to make the application; but the day &s;hall come when without a &s;ingle exception, "the ran|&s;omed of the Lord &s;hall return and come with &s;ongs to Zion, and everla&s;ting joy &s;hall be upon their heads; they &s;hall obtain joy and gladne&s;s, and &s;orrow and mourning &s;hall flee away."</P>
<P>IT is a certain truth, that good qualifica|tions and valuable di&s;tinctions, conferred by a &s;overeign God on his rational creatures, will always operate in a way of pride and haughtine&s;s, if they con&s;ider the&s;e as terms and conditions obliging God to confer great things on them in future; how much &s;oever they may acknowledge free grace in all the&s;e excellent endowments. It is equally certain, that all the&s;e graces will operate in a way of meekne&s;s and humility, if con&s;idered only as God's fit and proper means, or gradations to confer benefits, founded on Chri&s;t as the only condition, and his atonement as the only foundation to make them &s;ure. Thus, although there will be great di&s;tinctions of grace and glory in heaven to all eternity, among the redeemed race, they who have
<PB N="306" REF="030609_0305_0FE8303DCA2B0318">
mo&s;t glory there, will excel others as much in the grace of heavenly meekne&s;s, as in any thing el&s;e. They will ca&s;t down the bright|e&s;t crowns; and in doing this, will bow, with the mo&s;t lowly reverence, before the throne of the great and glorious Sovereign of all.</P>
<P>IT may not be ami&s;s here to re&s;ume a thought before &s;ugge&s;ted, with &s;ome addi|tion. I have &s;aid that, on the <HI>limitarian</HI> plan of &s;alvation, the old covenant with Adam, and the new covenant in the go&s;pel are entirely one and the &s;ame, in every thing e&s;&s;ential or material; the difference is only in words, not in reality.</P>
<P>ARE we, under the go&s;pel, wholly depen|dent on God for every good qualification? So was Adam before the fall. Was real goodne&s;s, holine&s;s, or virtue required of him as a previous condition of eternal life? The &s;ame things, in kind, are required of us on the <HI>limitarian plan</HI> in the &s;ame view, only not in &s;o high a degree: For an <HI>holy heart</HI> is at the bottom of all the conditional accom|pli&s;hments they plead for, as making out our claim, in the &s;ight of God, to his eter|nal favor. Did God &s;ay to Adam you &s;hall produce or &s;hew your qualifications in heart and life, or el&s;e there is no foundation of hope from the con&s;titution you are under? Ju&s;t &s;o the <HI>limitarian</HI> preacher &s;ays to us un|der the go&s;pel. So in all other re&s;pects, the old and new con&s;titutions are, <HI>in their nature, &s;ub&s;tantially</HI> the &s;ame.</P>
<P>BUT, there is one difference to be taken
<PB N="307" REF="030609_0306_0FE8303F52F0FFC0">
notice of which makes the new covenant much more difficult to obtain eternal life by, than the old. It is this; the terms and con|ditions God required of Adam were &s;uch, as, at the time they were made, Adam had both natural and moral power to comply with: Whereas we now have only the natural pow|er, but no moral power within our &s;ouls. Though moral impotency is very far from excu&s;ing us from guilt; yet, neverthele&s;s, this &s;hews us that they who now hear the go&s;pel, are, on <HI>limitarian</HI> principles, in a far more perilous condition than man was, when placed under the fir&s;t covenant; or that Je&s;us Chri&s;t preached in all his infinite ful|ne&s;s, is not &s;o good a foundation to rely up|on, as the covenant of works was. And is this the account God hath given us of the foundation he hath laid in Zion? You may an&s;wer and &s;ay, Chri&s;t hath undertaken and engaged for &s;inners, to work all things in and for them. This is indeed a GLORIOUS TRUTH. Yet upon the <HI>limitarian &s;cheme,</HI> are not the great multitude of mankind left out of this engagement, and under an eternal decree of reprobation too? And not every one of them commanded to believe and repent and become a new creature, and that upon pain of damnation mo&s;t dreadfully aggravated? And is this good news to all people? Is this go&s;pel, or good news to every creature un|der heaven?

So far as the new covenant has been attended to with clearne&s;s, as <HI>pure go&s;|pel,</HI> they have always &s;aid tho&s;e things which cannot po&s;&s;ibly be true; unle&s;s, Chri&s;t hath given his life a ran&s;om for all; and died for the &s;ins of the whole world; and will have all men to be &s;aved; and will draw all men unto him, in the <HI>plain, &s;imple &s;en&s;e</HI> of lan|guage, without any comment at all. Every &s;entence and exhibition of pure go&s;pel, from the fir&s;t to the la&s;t page in the book of God, does fully announce or imply the &s;ame; though the de&s;ert of man, on the covenant of works, is all along kept in our view, with all the dreadful thunders of a broken law, and the tremendous wrath of Deity again&s;t &s;in every where di&s;played as a flaming fire. The go&s;pel and the law over again&s;t each other, even as in their ancient types, mount <HI>Gerizim</HI> and mount <HI>Ebal.</HI></P>
<P>IT is my very humble, though very firm conclu&s;ion, after all po&s;&s;ible attention to the nature of things, and to the word of God, that what&s;oever mi&s;erable &s;inner of the hu|man kind is di&s;po&s;ed to collect the lea&s;t ray of hope from any di&s;tinctions, or qualifica|tions in his heart, or in his life, however he may come by them, to embolden him to de|pend on eternal life, as promi&s;ed in <HI>con&s;equence</HI> of the&s;e things; but not <HI>in&s;ured</HI> in the Me|diator previous to all, or any of the&s;e quali|fications, and that mo&s;t ab&s;olutely in the
<PB N="310" REF="030609_0309_0FE8300E8735EAB0">
covenant of redemption; that man, I &s;ay, does &s;till virtually de&s;ire to be under the law. And he &s;hall hear the law too, until the &s;pirit of God &s;hall be plea&s;ed to furni&s;h him with a more honorable &s;en&s;e of the true God, and Je&s;us Chri&s;t whom he hath &s;ent; and more exalted views of the glory of JE|HOVAH, in the manife&s;tations of infinite, eter|nal, &s;elf-moved love, and in his di&s;plays of &s;overeign mercy to a lo&s;t world.</P>
<P>I WOULD now re&s;ume and illu&s;trate a thought which I have before introduced. It is a common thing among men, that a man is condemned in one character, and ju&s;tified in another, even the &s;ame man. A judge may be likewi&s;e general of an army. He may appear exceeding well in one of the&s;e characters, and very bad in the other. He may be ju&s;tly damned or condemned as a general, having ruined his country in his military character; and yet be much ap|proved or ju&s;tified as a civilian. He may be ju&s;tly amerced to the amount of ten times the value of his e&s;tate, and ca&s;t into pri&s;on for life; yet be wholly ju&s;tified in the latter character. A &s;pon&s;or may &s;tep in and re|deem him, and he may after that enjoy the ble&s;&s;ings of his good character; although his bad one will remain forever condemned, and not the le&s;s &s;o becau&s;e he is redeemed from the penalty of it.</P>
<P>NO fair, candid reader will cavil at this &s;imile, becau&s;e it does not <HI>quadrate</HI> in all re&s;|pects: Since it does intirely in the point de|&s;igned to be illu&s;trated by it, which is, that
<PB N="311" REF="030609_0310_0FE82FE720CCD5D8">
we may be forever condemned in one cha|racter; yet ju&s;tified in another, and al&s;o may be delivered from all the pains and pe|nalties ju&s;tly due to our condemned charac|ter and conduct. To &s;ay that both charac|ters in this &s;imilitude are per&s;onal; whereas, in the way of our &s;alvation, <HI>one</HI> is only im|putative, is nothing at all to the purpo&s;e. For the imputed character is, in the account of our great Judge, and by the covenant of redemption, ju&s;t the &s;ame as to our redemp|tion from the pains of hell, and our title to heaven, as if it were per&s;onal.</P>
<P>THE common &s;en&s;e and practice of man|kind, in many ca&s;es in common life, ap|proves of the condemnation and ju&s;tification of the &s;ame per&s;ons, in different relations and connections; and of the indemnity of men mo&s;t ju&s;tly condemned, in a real cha|racter, which they have per&s;onally &s;u&s;tained. And though men cannot be happy and mi&s;e|rable at the &s;ame time; yet they may be hap|py, in their per&s;ons and real enjoyments, while forever con&s;cious they have merited nothing but &s;orrow and woe.</P>
<P>IT is further an evidence of true go&s;pel faith and hope; that they work by love, and purify the heart and life. Faith operates in a way of love to God and man; "and every man that hath this hope in him puri|fieth him&s;elf even as HE is pure."</P>
<P>I HAVE already ob&s;erved, that the faith and hope for which I am pleading, always have &s;uch an effect, and, in the very nature
<PB N="312" REF="030609_0311_0FE8305708D984A8">
of things, always will, while men and moral agents remain what God has made them. Al&s;o my own experience does indeed witne&s;s to this truth. I &s;uppo&s;e that my own &s;oul is formed on the general, the univer&s;al plan of human nature: And I am certain that &s;uch a view of God and the way of &s;alvation as I am pleading for; &s;uch a view of man, and of all creatures, and of their entire, ab|&s;olute, and everla&s;ting dependence on God; &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of the guilt and mi&s;ery of man by nature, and the exalted glory of Chri&s;t, and of infinite, free, and &s;overeign grace, has, of all things, the mo&s;t powerful effect on my own heart to lead to repentance, odium of all &s;in, the mortification of every inordinate de&s;ire, and every worldly lu&s;t, joyful re&s;ignation to the will of God in all things, in all afflictions, however painful to nature, and to make me feel towards God and all his creatures, in imitation of the feelings of the ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer. I am certain that if I have, in any degree, the &s;ame mind which was al&s;o in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, I have it in this way. When I have the deepe&s;t &s;en&s;e of the&s;e things, the world and creatures appear to me as nothing, yea, le&s;s than nothing and vanity, and God all in all. Therefore, if other human &s;ouls are like mine, I have not the lea&s;t fear that under|&s;tanding the way of &s;alvation as I do, will do any harm to any child of Adam; but quite the rever&s;e.</P>
<P>I CANNOT contract my views of the great &s;alvation, the <HI>common &s;alvation,</HI> within nar|rower
<PB N="313" REF="030609_0312_0FE82FF090F61638">
limits, without limiting the Holy One of I&s;rael, even as to the capital glory of all his ways. Yet after all, I am happy in this, that if my dear kindred of the human kind, or many of them cannot, at pre&s;ent, extend their faith beyond the <HI>narrow</HI> bounds of the <HI>limitarian plan;</HI> yet they are &s;till in the &s;ure way to eternal &s;alvation, if they fall not &s;hort of their own under&s;tanding of the way of life; that is to &s;ay, if they have that re|pentance, <HI>faith,</HI> and holine&s;s which they hold nece&s;&s;ary; which is exactly the &s;ame as that which I maintain nece&s;&s;ary, and in a way of free grace only. I well know that every man is <HI>at pre&s;ent,</HI> in the way that leadeth to de&s;truction, who hath not the&s;e graces. If many &s;uppo&s;e, that the great Mediator hath never engaged, in his own way and time, to give the&s;e graces, except to a few of the human kind; let them &s;ee to it that they be found among tho&s;e few. If they do this, they &s;hall never fail.</P>
<P>THEIR faith falls &s;hort in no e&s;&s;ential point: Their unhappine&s;s lies only in this, that they do not draw all the ble&s;&s;ed con|&s;equences and comforts they might draw, from premi&s;es truly evangelical and &s;av|ing. The premi&s;es are not un&s;afe, as far as they go. If inwrought into the &s;oul, they &s;hall lead to &s;afety. We ought, however, to &s;atisfy our&s;elves in the inqui|ry, WHAT IS TRUTH? Yet it is not our believing, or not believing, that there
<PB N="314" REF="030609_0313_0FE82FEE20D61120">
are many or few who &s;hall arrive at glo|ry, which will &s;ave or ruin any of us. Be|lieving the great, e&s;&s;ential doctrines of grace, and living agreeably to the power of them; believing on the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t to the &s;aving of our &s;ouls, and following him in the regeneration, whether that work be done for us &s;ooner or later, the&s;e, as God's means, will end in glo|ry. No man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord in glory, without <HI>holine&s;s,</HI> and that in a far more perfect degree than ever any man had in this world &s;ince the fall, or ever will have while breath remains, or the &s;oul is in uni|on with this mortal body. Mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed however, are tho&s;e elect of God, cho&s;en in Chri&s;t to early conver&s;ion, piety, and holine&s;s, and to a life of faith, godline&s;s, and divine plea&s;ure all their days.</P>
<P>LET tho&s;e who believe, that, in the mo&s;t <HI>plain</HI> and <HI>literal &s;en&s;e,</HI> Chri&s;t is God's &s;al|vation to the ends of the earth: That as &s;in hath reigned unto death, <HI>much more,</HI> &s;hall grace reign through righteou&s;ne&s;s to eter|nal life, by Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord: And that as, by one man, judgment came upon all men unto condemnation; &s;o, by the righteou&s;ne&s;s of one, the free gift came upon all men unto ju&s;tification of life: I &s;ay, let all &s;uch &s;ee to it, without de|lay, that they become new creatures. Such &s;hould be immediately reconciled to that God, in the actual temper of their &s;ouls, who is <HI>truly reconciled</HI> to them, in the covenant of redemption, and the atonement
<PB N="315" REF="030609_0314_0FE82FE8AA4C81A8">
of his dear Son; and they &s;hould walk worthy of him, who hath called them to his kingdom and glory. For, in very deed, there is the &s;ame nece&s;&s;ity of all this, in order that we may be happy in the world to come, on the doctrine here ad|vanced, as on any limited plan of &s;alva|tion, that ever entered into the minds of any of the lo&s;t human race.</P>
<P>THE great bu&s;ine&s;s of the preachers of righteou&s;ne&s;s is little concerned, in tell|ing, <HI>how many &s;hall be &s;aved;</HI> but rather, how guilty, mi&s;erable &s;ouls &s;hall be &s;aved. They are to hold up to the view of all men, the true character of JEHOVAH, and of fallen man: And the relation in which man &s;tands to his Maker and his Judge, his Redeemer, and the Sanctifier of the pol|luted human &s;oul: What Chri&s;t hath done to lay the &s;ole foundation of all his hopes: What mu&s;t be done on his &s;oul to bring him to the fruition of that ble&s;&s;edne&s;s which alone can happily his immortal &s;oul: What man mu&s;t be and do, as indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary, in its due place, to give him true comfort in this world, and introduce him to the inheritance and enjoyment of a kingdom prepared for the elect body of Chri&s;t, and, with God, made ab&s;olutely &s;ure to that whole body, before the world began: And to point out and inforce all relative duties, and every moral virtue, agreeably to the rea&s;on and nature of things, and the word of God.</P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="030609_0315_0FE7EC3EF1546718">THEY are al&s;o to &s;hew the horrible nature of all &s;in, vice, and immorality; that it is even death, hell, and damnation, &s;o long as the &s;oul continues impenitent in the ways of it.

They are to give hope and re|lief to the &s;inking, de&s;pairing &s;oul, <HI>in Chri&s;t alone,</HI> and comfort to the children of God in <HI>him only:</HI> To lead in the holy and joyful &s;o|lemnities of divine wor&s;hip, in the high prai|&s;es of God and the Lamb: To preach the <HI>un&s;earchable riches of Chri&s;t:</HI> And to mani|fe&s;t their &s;olemn &s;en&s;e of all the&s;e things, by a pure and holy life and example.

<P>COULD I po&s;&s;ibly conceive of any way,
<PB N="317" REF="030609_0316_0FE82FFECAFB95A0">
in which the great and holy God might be more glorified in the eternal <HI>per&s;onal</HI> damnation of many, or mo&s;t of mankind, than in extending final redemption to them all; I certainly ought to acquie&s;ce in &s;uch a fearful event, yea, even to wi&s;h for it. But as it really appears to me, from the nature of God, from his word, and from all his works, and above all, from the character, atonement and commi&s;&s;ion of his dear Son, and from the covenant of redemption and of grace, that the mo&s;t high and holy God cannot leave one hu|man &s;oul forever, under the power of &s;piritual and eternal death, con&s;i&s;tent with his own highe&s;t declarative honor, and glory; I ought not, I cannot believe he ever will.</P>
<P>MY rea&s;on is weak, very weak indeed; yet it is my duty to keep clo&s;e to the dictates of it, under the all-&s;acred autho|rity of divine revelation. I cannot po&s;|&s;ibly &s;ee, but that, in the eternal, per|&s;onal damnation of one human &s;oul, the Mo&s;t High would ca&s;t a great reflection on the full and complete atonement of the Son of his love, and al&s;o on the Fa|ther him&s;elf, as the Son is the brightne&s;s of his Father's glory, and the expre&s;s i|mage of his per&s;on. The di&s;honorable reflection appears to me would con&s;i&s;t in this; it would fully imply and indicate, either, that the atonement of Chri&s;t was not infinite, nor his power and faithfulne&s;s; or that the love, pity, mercy, and grace of
<PB N="318" REF="030609_0317_0FE82FF607E8D378">
God, was not infinite; or that the &s;ati&s;|faction of Chri&s;t could not be adequate to the divine law.</P>
<P>TO imagine there is any need of the <HI>eternal per&s;onal torment</HI> of any &s;inner of the human race, in order further to illu&s;trate the holine&s;s and ju&s;tice of God, the infi|nite evil of &s;in; or further to impre&s;s the minds of the intelligent &s;y&s;tem with a &s;en&s;e of the infinite odiou&s;ne&s;s of &s;in, and the infinite purity of God, and his infinite hatred of all &s;in, is plainly to &s;uppo&s;e that the great work of the Son of God can admit of &s;ome amendment; that in very deed it is not a fini&s;hed work. For any man to think this nece&s;|&s;ary or expedient, or any &s;uch thing, is an amazing reflection on him who &s;aid "IT IS FINISHED," when he bowed his head and gave up the gho&s;t. It is infi|nitely more ab&s;urd than it would be for a nobleman, who&s;e galleries are adorned with the inimitable performances of a <HI>Raphael</HI> or a <HI>Titian,</HI> afterwards to employ the mo&s;t contemptible of all painters, to come and retouch them, in order to their greater embelli&s;hment! <HI>God is a rock, his work is perfect.</HI> The work of redemption is mo&s;t emphatically &s;o. Of all that per|tains to this work, mu&s;t it be &s;aid, "What|&s;oever God doth, it &s;hall be forever: No|thing can be put to it, nor any thing ta|ken from it; and God doth it that man &s;hould fear before him."</P>
<P>IN good truth, I can learn nothing from
<PB N="319" REF="030609_0318_0FE83015957E3E38">
the nature, character, word, or works of God; nothing from the emanations he has been plea&s;ed to make of him&s;elf, that leads me to a &s;ingle idea that the mo&s;t holy God, &s;ince what hath been done and &s;uffered by the Son of his love, can derive any glo|ry to him&s;elf, or communicate any in|&s;truction, any good to the intelligent &s;y&s;|tem, from the eternal, per&s;onal damnation of any poor, mi&s;erable, guilty &s;inner of the human kind; or that &s;uch a thing can be without manife&s;t oppo&s;ition to the ble&s;&s;ed nature of God, who is infinite love, and to the glorious and merciful covenant of re|demption, and all the mo&s;t glorious and tre|mendous work of the Son of God, which he fini&s;hed on the cro&s;s. I cannot &s;ee, but that the nature of God is now open, (if I may &s;o &s;peak) the nature of eternal, infi|nite, unlimited, boundle&s;s love, is now free to take its &s;pontaneous cour&s;e, without the lea&s;t ob&s;tacle, from any oppo&s;ing claims of ju&s;tice, &s;tanding in the way of the final &s;al|vation of a whole guilty world.

<P>I AM con&s;trained to think, that it is this very plan of redeeming wi&s;dom, power, and love, that the four and twenty elders, the repre&s;entatives of all the redeemed on high,
<PB N="320" REF="030609_0319_0FE830100EFC49D8">
hold in rapturous contemplation; and al&s;o all the ble&s;&s;ed in heaven, when they fall down before him that &s;itteth on the throne, and wor&s;hip him that liveth forever and ever, and ca&s;t their crowns before the throne, &s;aying, thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory, and honor, and power: for thou ha&s;t created all things, and for thy plea&s;ure they are and were created." <HI>Thy plea&s;ure,</HI> mo&s;t emphatically, as all things were made for, and re&s;ult in the glories of redeeming love. Rev. iv. Nor can I, on any <HI>limitarian plan,</HI> or on any in the uni|ver&s;e, but that I am pleading for, account for that glorious di&s;play. Rev. v. "And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne, and the liv|ing creatures,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> and the elders; and the number of them was ten thou&s;and times ten thou&s;and, and thou&s;ands of thou&s;ands; &s;aying, with a loud-voice, worthy is the Lamb that was &s;lain, to receive power, and riches, and wi&s;dom, and &s;trength, and ho|nor, and glory, and ble&s;&s;ing. And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and &s;uch as are in the &s;ea, and all that are in them, heard I, &s;aying, ble&s;&s;ing, and honor, and glory, and power, be unto him that &s;itteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for|ever and ever.

twenty elders fell down, and wor&s;hipped him that liveth forever and ever."</P>
<P>IF we attend only to the voice of the holy law of God, as it &s;ounds every where through the bible, we mu&s;t forever de&s;pair, not only of the &s;alvation of this lo&s;t <HI>world,</HI> but of any <HI>one</HI> of the fallen race; unle&s;s we con&s;ider this law, in all its maledicti|ons, and in all its holy demands, <HI>wholly</HI> &s;atisfied in the &s;econd man, the Lord from heaven. This indeed, is pure go&s;pel truth. When we &s;o con&s;ider it, the door of &s;al|vation is wide open for all, and open a|like for every child of Adam. The whole debt is paid, and why &s;hould not all the pri&s;oners be di&s;charged? Chri&s;t paid it not for him&s;elf, but for them, and that according to divine &s;tipulation, and the entire good plea&s;ure of the Father. "Me&s;|&s;iah &s;hall be cut off, but not for him|&s;elf."</P>
<P>HE has as much power and love, as he has of merit; and his <HI>kingly</HI> and <HI>prophet|ical</HI> abilities are equal to his <HI>prie&s;tly.</HI> All power is given to him, in heaven and in earth.

to Chri&s;t, that we re&s;train the bowels of his love in our own minds? Or is it agreeable to his word? Ye are not &s;traitened in him; but ye are &s;traitened in your own bowels.

<P>YOU, my reader, know, in your own &s;oul, that you &s;incerely and cordially love your neighbor, and daily give him every po&s;&s;ible proof of it; yet he &s;o hates you, that he cannot, he will not believe that you love him, and is ever complaining of you as the mo&s;t bitter, cruel enemy he has in the world. Does he not abu&s;e and di&s;honor you? But what proof did you ever give to any man on earth, that you loved him and wi&s;hed well to him, in any mea&s;ure comparable to the te&s;timonies of love, mercy, pity, and real good will which the Redeemer does daily produce, to prove his real, wonderful love, mer|cy, and pity toward every child of A|dam? He be&s;tows more real kindne&s;s on the vile&s;t &s;inner in the world, in one day, than ever you be&s;towed on any per&s;on on earth, in your whole life.</P>
<P>AFTER all this, for us to &s;ay, that it is his will and di&s;po&s;ition to damn mo&s;t of mankind in per&s;on, to all eternity, appears to me not honorable to the true charac|ter of Chri&s;t, or agreeable to his word. To &s;ay, he is willing to &s;ave every &s;inner, that he taketh no plea&s;ure in the death of him

that dieth, but that he would turn and &s;ive; and yet that God Almighty will not &s;ee that effected in his own way and time, in which he &s;o much delights, and <HI>that,</HI> after every ob&s;tacle is removed by his Son, which ever &s;tood in the way of man's &s;alva|tion, I think, is very far from doing honor to the character of the living and true God.

<P>FOR my own part, I feel afraid to &s;peak, or even think of my heavenly Father, in the <HI>limitarian</HI> view of him; le&s;t I &s;hould awful|ly abu&s;e that character which claims my highe&s;t reverence and love.

<P>THE blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t clean&s;eth from <HI>all</HI> &s;in, from <HI>impenitence, hardne&s;s of heart,</HI> and <HI>blindne&s;s of mind,</HI> as well as practical &s;ins. Indeed, if it did not, it could clean&s;e from no &s;in at all: For <HI>the&s;e</HI> are the foun|tain of all other &s;ins and the greate&s;t of all. All &s;ins are alike forgiven to men, and done away in the atonement; and rege|neration, repentance and faith, are commu|nicated on the &s;ame ground, and their of|fice is to make us "<HI>know the things freely giv|en us of God.</HI>" God &s;ent his beloved Son into the world, that the world, through him might be &s;aved; and he "ta&s;ted death for <HI>every man.</HI>" The prophet fore&s;aw this, and he &s;peaks of the ble&s;&s;ed con&s;equence, without a word or thought of limitation. He con|&s;iders a lo&s;t world all alike pri&s;oners of ju&s;tice, and ca&s;t into one and the &s;ame doleful pit together; yet proclaims aloud, "By the blood of thy covenant, I have &s;ent forth thy pri&s;oners out of the pit wherein is no water." Zech. ix. 11. Nor had I&s;aiah any thought of limitation, when he &s;peaks of the anointing of the Son of God, "to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the pri&s;on to them that are bound; to comfort ALL that mourn."
<PB N="325" REF="030609_0324_0FE8304F1CC84940">
I&s;ai. lxi. "That thou maye&s;t &s;ay to the pri&s;oners, go forth; and to them that are in darkne&s;s, &s;hew your&s;elves." I&s;ai. xlix. 9. And it is worthy of our notice, that when the Savior was commenting on the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, he immediately took occa&s;ion to open the extent of his &s;alvation to the audience. Luke iv. This was as much to their &s;urpri&s;e and offence, as the mo&s;t exten&s;ive doctrine of the &s;alvation of &s;inners now is to the mo&s;t tenacious retainer of the doctrine of a <HI>par|tial &s;alvation.</HI></P>
<P>AS I have already hinted, whatever doc|trinal per&s;ua&s;ion may be in the mind of any unregenerate man, that the way of &s;al|vation, and the extent of it, according to the nature and word of God, is &s;uch as I main|tain, this doctrine will never quiet an alarm|ing, polluted con&s;cience, and &s;et the &s;oul at re&s;t from awful fears and terrors; until it is acquainted with God and <HI>reconciled</HI> to him.</P>
<P>WHILE total enmity to God remains in the &s;oul, there will he di&s;tre&s;&s;ing fears in &s;ea&s;ons of reflection. Nor is it po&s;&s;ible in the nature of things, that creatures that hate God as we do, in our natural &s;tate, &s;hould have that exalted &s;en&s;e of his love, which is manife&s;t|ed in the go&s;pel, and is indeed the glory of it. Blind, unrenewed &s;inners will mea&s;ure the love of God, and the motives on which they &s;uppo&s;e God acts, much by their own.</P>
<P>WE mu&s;t indeed know the living and true God, and Je&s;us Chri&s;t whom he hath &s;ent, in order to have a feeling apprehen&s;ion of
<PB N="326" REF="030609_0325_0FE83053AF5B0FE8">
our eternal life, as manife&s;t in the go&s;|pel; whether we have a more confined, or a more exten&s;ive under&s;tanding of it. <HI>Never can we have comfort in the reconcili|ation of a friend, to us; until our hearts meet with him in that reconciliation.</HI> If our enmity remains, it will exclude us from comfort in his friend&s;hip. How impor|tant then is an immediate reconciliation to God, by a new creation in Chri&s;t Je|&s;us, and by repentance and faith in his blood!</P>
<P>THE infinite importance of immediate reconciliation to God, is even more for|cibly urged on the doctrine I have ad|vanced, than on any more limited prin|ciples. The great apo&s;tle Paul hath in a few words, virtually &s;aid all I have been pleading for; and from premi&s;es ari&s;ing from the mo&s;t exten&s;ive view of the a|tonement of Chri&s;t, he does mo&s;t forcibly inculcate the immediate reconciliation of &s;inners to God. "For the love of Chri&s;t con&s;traineth us, becau&s;e we thus judge, that if <HI>one</HI> died for <HI>all,</HI> then were all dead; and that he died for <HI>all,</HI> that they which live, &s;hould not henceforth live unto them&s;elves, but unto him who died for them, and ro&s;e again. And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to him&s;elf by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and hath given to us the mini&s;try of reconciliation; to wit, that God was in Chri&s;t reconciling <HI>the world</HI> unto him&s;elf, not imputing their tre&s;pa&s;&s;es unto them: and hath commited
<PB N="327" REF="030609_0326_0FE7EC3D617B9820">
unto us the word of reconciliation. Now then we are amba&s;&s;adors for Chri&s;t, at though God did be&s;eech you by us: We pray you in Chri&s;t's &s;tead, be ye recon|ciled to God. For he hath made him to be &s;in for us, who knew no &s;in; that we might be made the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God in him." 2. Cor. v.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH this apo&s;tle did al&s;o preach the law abundantly, and &s;ound the voice of pure ju&s;tice in all its tremendous ter|rors; yet he never preached or wrote one word incon&s;i&s;tent with what I have ju&s;t quoted. Whenever in his preaching or writing, he held up the go&s;pel to view, it was of the &s;ame tenor. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of all the other apo&s;tles, and of all the prophets. They learned it from Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf, in whom the only foundation was laid, and who announced the &s;ame glorious tidings.</P>
<P>AND, truly, as I have before hinted, I never read or heard any di&s;cour&s;es of eminent and pious prote&s;tant divines, but what were built on premi&s;es and argu|ments which fully infer that glorious, final extent of &s;alvation, which I maintain, how|ever incon&s;i&s;tent they may have been, in &s;ome parts of their writings or &s;ermons. Indeed, all I have now written, is nothing more or le&s;s than the common, genuine, prote&s;tant doctrine of grace, &s;et free from all the contradictions and incon&s;i&s;tencies that have &s;o long been intermixed with it, and the genuine and glorious con&s;e|quences
<PB N="328" REF="030609_0327_0FE8301D70208A98">
of it more openly and explicit|ly di&s;played. And thus I read tho&s;e writings &s;till, and ever &s;hall, with great edification and plea&s;ure. And the incon|&s;i&s;tencies I find intermixed with &s;uch pure and glorious truths, give me no more offence, than the bones I find in deli|cious fi&s;h or fowl at my table.</P>
<P>TO clo&s;e the whole, as a con&s;i&s;tent IM|PROVEMENT of this doctrine of &s;alvation.</P>
<P>HOW &s;hould we love, fear, adore, and obey &s;uch a God, who&s;e nature and cha|racter is &s;uch as here exhibited to our view! How ought we to &s;ubmit to him in all things, and rejoice in him evermore! What a foundation is here laid for the relief of the mo&s;t guilty, even the chief of &s;inners! What high and honorable thoughts of God &s;hould we ever enter|tain, and what &s;hould we think of Chri&s;t his Son! What comfort and even joy does this doctrine afford us in all &s;cenes of divine providence, in the whole govern|ment of &s;uch a God!</P>
<P>HENCE how are we taught to love one another, to love, pity and pray for all our fellow &s;inners! How will the firm be|lief of this doctrine lead us to prize the word and ordinances of God, and to de|light in his wor&s;hip, and to call on all creatures to prai&s;e the Lord, who&s;e mercy endureth forever, and to hate all &s;in, all that is oppo&s;ite to the nature and com|mands
<PB N="329" REF="030609_0328_0FE82FF78F0F9358">
of &s;uch a God! How will the&s;e principles, if really in the heart, produce a feeling &s;en&s;e that all &s;in, vice and immo|rality, is no other than death, hell, and damnation; and that holine&s;s and virtue is heaven and divine glory! How will they lead us to live religion, for the love and plea&s;ure of it; and to mourn for, and &s;hun all di&s;obedience to God, all moral evil as hateful beyond all expre&s;&s;ion, in its own nature, and as that which co&s;t our be&s;t Friend, our ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer &s;o dear! How will the&s;e truths, if really believed and wrought into the &s;oul, pro|mote love, union, and harmony among all the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, and every branch of his church redeemed by his own blood, of <HI>whatever denomination they are!</HI></P>
<P>THESE principles cannot make tho&s;e who do not believe them, either wor&s;e or better: For they can have no effect upon them. And as for all tho&s;e who do real|ly <HI>in their hearts</HI> believe in this &s;alva|tion, I am certain the effect will be very great and good. Their hearts will be en|larged, and they will run in the way of God's commandments. Our mi&s;ery con&s;i&s;ts very much in the want of high and honora|ble thoughts of God and of Chri&s;t. And we fall &s;hort in nothing more than in our ideas of the divine love. There is not a mi&s;erable &s;inner on earth, and never was, who would not tru&s;t in God, if he had a knowledge of his true character. "They
<PB N="330" REF="030609_0329_0FE83008331DB180">
that know thy name will put their tru&s;t in thee." P&s;al. ix. 10. But all that know not God, are in a &s;tate of condemnation. There never can be any danger of our having too exalted and enlarged thoughts of any of the attributes of God, no not of his love: For GOD IS LOVE. And to keep our&s;elves in the love of God, in all the infinite extent of it, can never bring us into condemnation.</P>
<P>YOU, my dear reader, as well as the writer, mu&s;t &s;oon die, and appear at the awful bar of an omni&s;cient and holy Judge. We mu&s;t &s;oon make trial of the foundation of the hope upon which we build. Our di&s;tinctions from other lo&s;t &s;inners, will probably be no greater then, than at this very moment; and where &s;hall we look for &s;upport then? To things within our|&s;elves, or to Je&s;us Chri&s;t? To our good qualifications, or to God alone? <HI>Will you, my friend, venture into the eternal world with any hope, or any mixture of hope, but what is built on</HI> JEHOVAH <HI>alone, as manife&s;t in his beloved Son?</HI></P>
<P>WHATEVER men may plead, in days of health, in favor of marks and di&s;tinctions <HI>in them&s;elves,</HI> to feed their vanity, or &s;upport their hope; I never yet di&s;cour&s;ed with any dying man in the exerci&s;e of his rati|onal powers, who did not entirely &s;et at nought every &s;uch ground of hope. I have invariably found every one who felt within his &s;oul in that awful, trying hour,
<PB N="331" REF="030609_0330_0FE8301FD92F1908">
any hope at all, has fixed it wholly on the glorious nature and attributes of God, as di&s;played in the great Redeemer. And whatever our <HI>refuge</HI> may be now, you and I, my dear friend, mu&s;t make <HI>this</HI> our la&s;t refuge. Death is too terrible, and the tribunal of the great Judge too awful, to admit of any confidence but in Chri&s;t alone.</P>
<P>WE &s;hall not feel our&s;elves &s;o much bet|ter than others, when death and the judg|ment &s;tare us in the face, as we are apt to do, in days of worldly pro&s;perity and plea|&s;ure. Whatever we imagine now, we &s;hall then be fully convinced that a &s;ole, un|mixed dependence on God in Chri&s;t can alone &s;upport our trembling &s;ouls; and that every other refuge is but a refuge of lies. We &s;hall then find our need of Chri&s;t for wi&s;dom, righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;anctifi|cation, and compleat redemption in every view, and in every part of it, for Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, the fir&s;t and the la&s;t. God, in his Son, will be all in all. And in that trying hour, we &s;hall all find, that it is our &s;ole re|fuge and only con&s;olation, that, OF HIM, AND THROUGH HIM, AND TO HIM ARE ALL THINGS, TO WHOM BE GLORY FOREVER.</P>
