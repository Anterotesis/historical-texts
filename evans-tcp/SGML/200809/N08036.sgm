</EPIGRAPH>
<P>MY view, in the choice of this text, is, without the lo&s;s of time by a prefatory introduction, to employ your thoughts upon the following important points contained in it.</P>
<P>A &s;ummary de&s;cription of the &s;ubject, it is proper mini&s;ters &s;hould preach upon; "the my&s;tery of the Go&s;pel". Their duty to make this &s;ubject the main &s;cope of their preaching; "that I may make known the my&s;tery of the Go&s;pel". The nece&s;&s;ity of boldne&s;s, or forti|tude, in order to their faithfully di&s;charging this part of the tru&s;t committed to them; "that I may open my mouth boldly to make known the my&s;tery of the Go&s;pel", Finally, the people's
<PB N="6" REF="010256_0004_0F7E24ADE2635C28">
duty to pray for their mini&s;ters, particularly, that they may preach the Go&s;pel with boldne&s;s and re&s;olution; "praying always with all prayer;&mdash;and for me,&mdash;that I may open my mouth bold|ly".&mdash;</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing ob&s;ervable in the text is, the de&s;cription it gives of the &s;ubject mini&s;ters &s;hould preach upon; "the my&s;tery of the Go&s;pel". It is el&s;ewhere called "the my&s;tery of God", "the my&s;tery of Chri&s;t", "the my&s;tery of faith", "the wi&s;dom of God in a my&s;tery". The&s;e phra&s;es, all of them, import the &s;ame thing with what is more &s;imply called, in the in&s;pired books, "the word of truth", "the word of faith", "the faith of Chri&s;t", "the faith once delivered to the &s;aints"; and they include in their meaning the whole chri&s;tian &s;cheme of redemption: It's occa&s;ion; the undone &s;tate of the lap&s;ed &s;ons of Adam: It's original ri&s;e; the free favor of the infinitely benevolent Deity: and the method of its execution: the advent of God's only begotten Son into our world, to take on him our nature, and accompli&s;h the work laid out for him, as expedient in order to the purcha&s;e and be&s;towment, not only of pardon, ju&s;tifica|tion, and a glorious immortality beyond the grave; but of that "meetne&s;s" for the&s;e ble&s;|&s;ings, without which they could neither be di&s;|pen&s;ed or enjoyed. The&s;e capital articles, with their various connections and important deducti|ons, e&s;pecially as pointed out, and dilated on, in the &s;acred &s;criptures, are all comprehended in that "my&s;tery of the Go&s;pel", the Apo&s;tle would
<PB N="7" REF="010256_0005_0F7E24AE94835BA8">
have mini&s;ters preach upon; and the&s;e they &s;hould accordingly make the great &s;cope, the main drift, of their preaching.</P>
<P>But you will a&s;k, why is the Go&s;pel, as con|taining the&s;e truths, called a "my&s;tery", when it has &s;et them in &s;o clear and &s;trong a light, that they may ea&s;ily be under&s;tood by all who have eyes to &s;ee, and will make a due u&s;e of them?</P>
<P>The an&s;wer, without multiplying words, is plainly this, it is thus &s;poken of, becau&s;e the&s;e truths were "hid in God" before the revelation of them, e&s;pecially the revelation of them by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and his Apo&s;tles.</P>
<P>It may be worthy of &s;pecial notice, the term "my&s;tery", as u&s;ed in the &s;cripture, does not mean a truth now remaining in the dark: but a truth that has been brought out of its former concealment, and placed in open light. In this &s;en&s;e it is evidently taken by the Apo&s;tle Paul, when he &s;ays to the Corinthians,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. 15. 51.</NOTE> "Behold, I &s;hew you a my&s;tery: we &s;hall not all &s;leep; but we &s;hall all be changed". It was, before the delivery of the&s;e words, an hidden truth, that the &s;aints, who may be alive on the earth at the &s;econd coming of Chri&s;t, &s;hall not die, but be at once changed into immortal creatures: and becau&s;e the Apo&s;tle revealed this &s;ecret, he ex|pre&s;&s;es him&s;elf in that emphatical language, "Behold, I &s;hew you a my&s;tery". i. e. I declare to you a truth you had no knowledge of before. Surely, he could not mean, that what he had thus "&s;hewed them" was &s;till a concealed thing. It would have been a &s;trange &s;ort of revelation, if the thing revealed had remained in its former
<PB N="8" REF="010256_0006_0F7E24B12133E0C0">
ob&s;curity, if it had been &s;till left "a my&s;tery"; meaning hereby an unknown &s;omething.</P>
<P>In this &s;ame &s;en&s;e, the grand corruption of chri&s;tianity, under the Roman "&s;on of perdi|tion", is &s;poken of in that language, "the my|&s;tery of iniquity". 'Tis called "a my&s;tery", not that it was now a concealed truth, but becau&s;e it had been hid among the other important &s;e|crets of providence, till pointed out, by the &s;pirit of prophe&s;y, as an event it was now known would certainly take place in its proper time.</P>
<P>In this &s;ame &s;en&s;e &s;till the word "my&s;tery" is to be under&s;tood, when our Savior &s;ays to his di&s;|ciples, "unto you it is given to know the my&s;|teries of the kingdom of Heaven". The truths they now knew, they had no idea of before it plea&s;ed Chri&s;t to give them the knowledge of them; but after this, they could not be hidden truths. How could they known them, if they were &s;till &s;ecrets of which they had no concep|tion?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Perhaps, the word "my&s;tery" is mo&s;t frequently applied, in the writings of the New Te&s;tament, to the "preaching of the Go&s;pel to the Gentiles". And why is this event &s;poken of as a "my&s;tery"? Not becau&s;e it was now an unknown truth, or an intricate perplexed one: but becau&s;e it lay hid from the knowledge of men before the Go&s;pel revelation of it. It is indeed acknowledged, the enlargement of God's kingdom, in the times of Chri&s;t, was &s;ometimes prophe&s;ied of in the writ|ings of the ancient prophets: For which rea&s;on, when it is called a "my&s;tery" a thing "hid in God" and "kept &s;ecret", as the expre&s;&s;ions &s;ometimes are, they mu&s;t not be interpreted to mean, that God had never given any intimations of this ob&s;ervable event: but only that the intimations were comparatively dark and ob&s;cure: in&s;omuch that it remained notwith&s;tanding, in a great mea&s;ure a "&s;ecret", a "truth that was not known". The Apo&s;tle Paul has &s;et this matter in its ju&s;t light, in tho&s;e words of his to the Gentile Ephe&s;ians, Chap. III. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">. 2&mdash;6. "If ye have heard of the di&s;pen&s;ation of the grace of God, which is given me to you ward; how that by revelation he hath made known unto me the <HI>my&s;tery</HI>&mdash;which, IN OTHER AGES WAS NOT MADE KNOWN UNTO THE SONS OF MEN AS IT IS NOW REVEALED UNTO HIS HOLY APOSTLES BY THE SPIRIT, that the Gentiles &s;hould be fellow heirs,&mdash;and partakers of his promi&s;e in Chri&s;t by the Go&s;pel". And in this re&s;pect, "the calling of the Gentiles" was properly a "my&s;tery"; and might well be &s;poken of in this &s;tyle: Tho', after its more clear and full revelation by Chri&s;t, and his Apo&s;tles, it no longer continued an "hidden" truth; and could be called a "my&s;tery" no otherwi&s;e than as it was, before this revelation, a truth that was not known AS it has been &s;ince.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="010256_0007_0F7E24B199F9BC08">
In agreement with what has been offered, it is ob&s;ervable, what is called, &s;imply and nakedly, "a my&s;tery", in my text, is, in other places, called "the revelation of the my&s;tery which had been kept &s;ecret"; "the my&s;tery which had been hid, but is now made manife&s;t"; "the my&s;tery that is to be made known", by tho&s;e who are entru&s;ted with the di&s;pen&s;ation of the Go&s;pel. The mode of diction, in the&s;e texts, is &s;trictly pro|per, and ea&s;ily intelligible, if by "my&s;tery" is under&s;tood, a formerly hidden truth, not one that is &s;o at pre&s;ent. To &s;peak of that as "revealed" and "made manife&s;t", which, after its "mani|fe&s;tation", is &s;till a &s;ecreted thing, is plainly ab|&s;urd: Tho' this that was a &s;ecret may be opened, and when it is &s;o, it may, with all propriety, be called "the revelation of a my&s;tery", a thing "hidden made manife&s;t".</P>
<P>It will be further evident, that we have given the true &s;en&s;e, in which the "Go&s;pel" is called "a my&s;tery". if it be con&s;idered, that this &s;en&s;e of the word exhibits a de&s;cription of the Go&s;pel that is exactly ju&s;t, and the only one that is &s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="010256_0008_0F7E24B2B13411C0">
It exhibits an acurately ju&s;t idea of the Go&s;pel, who&s;e peculiar and di&s;tingui&s;hing doctrines were &s;ecrets in the brea&s;t of God, which could not have been di&s;clo&s;ed by the utmo&s;t efforts of hu|man rea&s;on. "Revelation" is the way, in which they have been bro't to light. It is this, and this only, that has opened the everla&s;ting coun&s;els of the Divine will, relative to the di&s;play of &s;aving mercy towards the &s;inful &s;ons of men. The Heathen could, in the mo&s;t cultivated &s;tate of their under&s;tandings, know nothing of this all-wi&s;e contrivance of Heaven. Nay, even the Jewi&s;h nation were left much in the dark about it; it having plea&s;ed God to re&s;erve the mani|fe&s;tation of it to the times of Chri&s;t. And, in the&s;e days, it was fully made known. That which had been "hid from ages and generations", and therefore called "a my&s;tery", was now &s;tript of its ob&s;curity, and placed in a clear point of view. It is on this account that Chri&s;t, who knew the &s;ecret will, the hidden wi&s;dom of the Father, and opened it to the world, is &s;tiled em|phatically, "the light". And he is, in this re&s;|pect, as truly "the light" in the kingdom of grace, as the great luminary in the heavens is in the kingdom of nature; and he &s;hines with equal brightne&s;s and glory. The light diffu&s;ed from this "&s;un of righteou&s;ne&s;s" has "revealed" that which was formerly "hid," and "made known" that which before was "covered" with darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>And as the &s;en&s;e we have given of the word, "my&s;tery", exactly an&s;wers to the true character of the Go&s;pel, &s;o 'tis the only one that does &s;o.
<PB N="11" REF="010256_0009_0F7E24B31393CB88">
It would be a fal&s;e and injurious repre&s;entation of the Go&s;pel, to &s;peak of it as "a my&s;tery", meaning hereby, that it locked up its doctrines, hiding them from the under&s;tandings of men: or that it contain'd only a dark, intricate, and uncertain exhibition of the Divine will. Far from being my&s;terious in any &s;uch &s;en&s;e as this, it is a clear, plain, and full manife&s;tation of the whole mind of God, &s;o far as he tho't it proper we &s;hould be acquainted with it. And it would be a ba&s;e reflection on the wi&s;dom of the only good God to &s;ugge&s;t, as tho' he had revealed him&s;elf, by his &s;on Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in a "my&s;terious way"; meaning thereby a dark, intricate, con|cealed way, &s;o as not to be ea&s;ily, if at all, un|der&s;tood.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only add, notwith&s;tanding what has been offered, it is freely acknowledged, that &s;ome of the mo&s;t important truths of the Go&s;pel are not to be comprehended by &s;uch imperfect crea|tures as we are; yea, that, in &s;ome re&s;pects, they fall not within the reach even of our highe&s;t conception. Nor is there the lea&s;t incon&s;i&s;tency between this acknowledgment, and any part of the foregoing di&s;cour&s;e. What though &s;ome re|vealed truths contain that in them, which, in &s;ome re&s;pects, tran&s;cends all human under&s;tand|ing? May they not, at the &s;ame time, in other re&s;pects, be &s;o clearly manife&s;ted, as, without difficulty to be perceived and clearly under&s;tood? This is what may be, becau&s;e thus it really is. Such indeed is the weakne&s;s of our faculties, that the objects even of &s;en&s;e and rea&s;on, as well as revelation, in &s;ome re&s;pects, exceed their ut|mo&s;t
<PB N="12" REF="010256_0010_0F7E24B3D7C77E70">
mo&s;t reach; tho', in other re&s;pects, they are readily perceived, and clearly known. The wi&s;|dom of God has fixed the limits, beyond which we cannot go in our knowledge of the objects either of &s;en&s;e or rea&s;on. And the &s;ame wi&s;dom has done the &s;ame as to our knowledge of the objects of "revelation". God has opened them &s;o far as it &s;eemed good in his &s;ight; and thus far we may have a clear, ju&s;t, and full under|&s;tanding of them: But wherein he has left them my&s;terious, that is, hid from human appre|hen&s;ion, they cannot, in tho&s;e re&s;pects, be the objects of faith, becau&s;e they are not the objects of revelation&punc;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">What I mean may be illu&s;trated by a &s;cripture in&s;tance or two. That "the dead &s;hall be rai&s;ed" is a "revealed my&s;tery", that is, a &s;ecret that has been plainly made known; tho', before it's di&s;covery by revelation, it lay "hid" from the under&s;tandings of men. And thus far our ideas are clear and di&s;tinct: we have an ea&s;y intelligible propo&s;ition for the object of our faith. But as revelation does not proceed to declare, "how the dead are rai&s;ed", this &s;till remains a "my&s;tery", a truth &s;ecreted from our knowledge. Our ideas fail here, and &s;o mu&s;t our faith; as it has no object in particular to em|ploy its exerci&s;e.&mdash;Another "revealed my&s;tery" is, the "incarnation of the Son of God", his &s;o taking upon him our nature as to be, in true propriety, "the &s;on of man", as well as "the &s;on of God". And thus far we have a pla<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> determinate truth for the object of our faith. But reve|lation does not go on, and de&s;cribe the "modus" of that union between the&s;e different natures which denominate them one per&s;on. This therefore is &s;till left a "my&s;tery" a truth we know nothing about. It cannot therefore <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> ob|ject of faith.&mdash;The &s;ame may be &s;aid of all other "revealed my&s;teries". So far as they are made known, they are the objects of faith; but wherein they are left "my&s;terious", &s;ecreted from our knowledge, they cea&s;e being &s;o. We may, in general, believe, and ought to believe, that they contain that in them which goes beyond all human conception; but what this is in particular we know not. As we are wanting in ideas here, &s;o mu&s;t we be in faith. For, according to the con&s;titution of our minds, there cannot be the latter without the former.</NOTE> Nor &s;hould they be pried into, as tho' we could attain to an under&s;tanding of them; for this is impo&s;&s;ible, at lea&s;t, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of human faculties.</P>

And happy would it have been for the chri&s;|tian world, if this had been duly con&s;idered, and attended to. So many would not then, from a vain affectation of being "wi&s;e above what is written", have taken upon them, to the great di&s;advantage of the chri&s;tian doctrine, to unfold that which God has not revealed. If men will go about to explain the unknown modus of Go&s;pel-truths; venturing to &s;ay tho&s;e things, with reference to them, which God has not &s;een fit to manife&s;t, and 'tis therefore impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould under&s;tand, darkne&s;s and my&s;tery mu&s;t be the effect. But then, they &s;hould take care they don't charge this my&s;terious darkne&s;s, which is the fruit of their own vanity or weakne&s;s, upon the truths of God, revealed in the Go&s;pel of his Son, as tho' they were unintelligible. This would be to abu&s;e the revelation by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which has &s;et the doctrines of faith, tho&s;e e&s;pe|cially that are great and important, in a per&s;pi|cuous light; in&s;omuch that they can't ea&s;ily be mi&s;under&s;tood, wherein it has plea&s;ed God to reveal them, unle&s;s thro' pride, prejudice, or an attachment to &s;ome ba&s;e lu&s;t or other, either of the mind or fle&s;h: And wherein he has left them incomprehen&s;ible, we have only to admire in words like tho&s;e of the Apo&s;tle, "O the depth of the riches both of the wi&s;dom and knowledge of God"! But 'tis time to proceed,</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="010256_0012_0F7E24B562F42E60">
The next thing ob&s;ervable in the text is, a repre&s;entation of the proper work and duty of Go&s;pel-mini&s;ters; <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> "to make known the my&s;tery of the Go&s;pel". In order to under&s;tand which, it may be proper to ob&s;erve,</P>
<P>That the fir&s;t mini&s;ters, under the Go&s;pel-oeconomy, e&s;pecially the <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> were imme|diately in&s;tructed, by the Spirit of truth, in the knowledge of tho&s;e "my&s;teries", pertaining to the kingdom of God, and the &s;alvation of man thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which had been "kept &s;ecret from former ages and generations". And their great bu&s;ine&s;s, as per&s;ons entru&s;ted with the di&s;|pen&s;ation of the go&s;pel, was "to make known the&s;e my&s;teries", not to tho&s;e of their own pro|fe&s;&s;ion only, as was the way of the <HI>heathen prie&s;ts;</HI> but to the world in common. Being furni&s;hed, by the holy Gho&s;t, with &s;upernatural knowledge, as well as other nece&s;&s;ary gifts, they were &s;ent by Chri&s;t, even as he was &s;ent by the Father, "to make known the my&s;tery of the Go&s;pel to all nations"; yea, to preach it "to every creature under Heaven". i. e. to all the &s;ons of men without di&s;tinction, or di&s;crimination: And it was the duty of all men, being fir&s;t ratio|nally convinced of the divine mi&s;&s;ion of the Apo&s;tles, to receive the Go&s;pel from them as "infallible in&s;tructors", per&s;ons &s;uitably quali|fied, and fully authori&s;ed, to deliver to them the truths of God and religion.</P>
<P>But the ca&s;e is quite different, with re&s;pect to the pre&s;ent mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel. They are not immediately guided by the Spirit into the "my&s;teries" of &s;alvation. They come not to
<PB N="15" REF="010256_0013_0F7E24B6123E8840">
the knowledge of them by in&s;piration from a|bove; but in the common and ordinary way, by taking pains to acquaint them&s;elves with the &s;a|cred writings, tho&s;e repo&s;itories of Go&s;pel-truths which were left by the Evangeli&s;ts and Apo&s;tles. It is not therefore any part of the work of mi|ni&s;ters, in the&s;e days, to publi&s;h "new revela|tions". They have no &s;ecrets to divulge, no "my&s;teries" peculiar to them&s;elves to "make known". No; but their proper work is, to ex|plain "the my&s;tery of the Go&s;pel", as it has been manife&s;ted by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and his Apo&s;tles, in the books of the new-te&s;tament. And this they &s;hould endeavour to do, with all the care and exactne&s;s, with all the per&s;picuity and plain|ne&s;s, they are able.</P>
<P>And that they might be well furni&s;hed here|for, they &s;hould carefully &s;tudy the &s;criptures, e&s;pecially the writings of the Evangeli&s;ts and Apo&s;tles; taking their &s;entiments of "revealed my&s;teries" from hence, and not from unin&s;pired compo&s;itions, whether by men con&s;idered as in|dividuals, or as united in bodies, whether greater or &s;maller, or however reputable for their capacity, integrity or orthodoxy. "What &s;aith the &s;crip|ture"? &s;hould be their grand enquiry. To this &s;acred te&s;t they &s;hould con&s;tantly repair; receiv|ing nothing, delivering nothing, for revealed truth, but what they have found there. They are, by office, "&s;tewards of the my&s;teries of God"; and where &s;hould they go, but to his written word, for the knowledge of them? They are no where infallibly contain'd, but in this &s;acred book. The BIBLE therefore, the BIBLE, I &s;ay, &s;hould be
<PB N="16" REF="010256_0014_0F7E24BA23411DB0">
the guide of their thoughts, the only rule of their faith: And they &s;hould make it evident by their preaching, that this has engro&s;&s;ed their time, and chiefly engaged their labor in their &s;tudies.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not think it improper to remark here, that it would be highly incongruous, I may &s;ay ju&s;tly offen&s;ive, if chri&s;tian mini&s;ters &s;hould &s;eem, in their di&s;cour&s;es to their hearers, as tho' they had little or no acquaintance with the revelation God has made of him&s;elf to mankind, by his &s;on Je&s;us Chri&s;t. It may rea&s;onably be expected of mini&s;ters, calling them&s;elves chri&s;tian, that they &s;hould appear to be &s;o, by their making known the doctrines of chri&s;tianity. The&s;e &s;hould be the grand &s;ubjects of their &s;ermons, the main &s;cope of their preaching. Not but that a chri&s;|tian mini&s;ter may, in perfect con&s;i&s;tency with his character, upon proper occa&s;ions, di&s;cour&s;e upon tho&s;e truths, which are not peculiar to the Go&s;pel. There never was a mini&s;ter that "made known the my&s;tery of the Go&s;pel" more clearly and faithfully, than the great <HI>Apo&s;tle of the Gentiles,</HI> I mean the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul:</HI> And yet, his di&s;cour&s;es did not always turn upon &s;ome &s;pecial truth of chri&s;tianity. He e&s;teemed it a point of wi&s;dom to adapt his &s;ermons to the circum&s;tances of his hearers: And for this rea&s;on, he cho&s;e, in &s;ome ca&s;es, to in&s;i&s;t rather upon a point of rea&s;on, than a doctrine of revelation. Thus, when he preach|ed to the idolatrous people at Ly&s;tra, his &s;ubject was, their "turning from vanities", or idols, to "the living God": And he illu&s;trated it, not from revelation, but a rational repre&s;entation of God, as having given to all nations &s;ufficient evi|dence
<PB N="17" REF="010256_0015_0F7E24BAE7A34720">
of his being, providence, and right to be wor&s;hipped and &s;erved as God; for that he "had done them good; and given them rain from hea|ven, and fruitful &s;ea&s;ons, filling their hearts with food and gladne&s;s"; as you may read in the 14th chapter of the <HI>Acts.</HI> In like manner, when he perceived the idolatrous &s;uper&s;titions of the men of Athens, he declared to them, in his preach|ing, "the one true and living God"; repre&s;ent|ing him as the only &s;uitable object of religious wor&s;hip, and proving him to be &s;o, in oppo&s;ition to "idols made with &s;ilver, or gold, or &s;tone graven by art, and man's device", from the con&s;ideration of him as "the maker of all men who dwell on the face of the earth": And in confirmation of this part of his argument, that "God is the maker of men, and men the offspring of God", in&s;tead of recurring to &s;cripture, he cites even one of their own heathen writers; "as certain al&s;o of your own poets have &s;aid, we are his offspring", Acts 17. from the 22. v. But this notwith&s;tanding, the main &s;ubjects of his di&s;cour&s;es were the "my&s;te|ries of the Go&s;pel". And thus &s;hould it be &s;aid of all chri&s;tian preachers, in the&s;e days. They &s;hould not ordinarily entertain their hearers with philo&s;ophical &s;peculations; much le&s;s &s;hould they &s;pend their breath in &s;ettling matters of difficult di&s;pute, "whereof cometh envy, &s;trife, railings and evil-&s;urmi&s;ings". The&s;e &s;hould not be the chief things to employ their mini&s;terial labors: No; but they &s;hould mainly in&s;i&s;t upon the me|thod of &s;alvation by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the coun&s;els of God that are unfolded to a mi&s;erable peri&s;h|ing world, in the writings of the new-te&s;tament.
<PB N="18" REF="010256_0016_0F7E24BB59BDDFD0">
With Philip, they &s;hould "preach the things con|cerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Chri&s;t Je&s;us". With Paul, they &s;hould "deter|mine to know nothing" among their people, "but Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and him crucified": Or, as it is expre&s;&s;ed in my text, they &s;hould "make known the my&s;tery of the Go&s;pel". And the more ful|ly and clearly they open it to the under&s;tandings of their hearers, the more will they de&s;erve the character of good and faithful mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t Je&s;us: E&s;pecially, if, together with the clearne&s;s in which they expre&s;s them&s;elves upon the "my&s;|teries" of chri&s;tianity, they join a becoming mo|de&s;ty; appearing &s;en&s;ible, that they know no more of the truths of the Go&s;pel than the peo|ple may know them&s;elves, if they have equal lei&s;ure and capacity, and will &s;tudy the bible with equal care and diligence. To be &s;ure, they &s;hould not deliver their interpretations of &s;cripture as "infallible" in&s;tructors, and give them out as oracles not to be di&s;puted, or examined, but im|plicitly believed. They &s;hould rather own them|&s;elves fallible men, of "like pa&s;&s;ions with others", and indanger of mi&s;takes and errors; commending to their people the example of the "noble Berae|ans", who "&s;earched the &s;criptures daily", to &s;ee whether the thing taught them were the truths of God, or not: yea, they &s;hould caution them again&s;t receiving what they deliver, in their preach|ing, otherwi&s;e than as it brings light with it, &s;o as that they are helped to perceive it to be "the truth as it is in Je&s;us".&mdash;But I would not be tedious.&mdash;To go on,</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="010256_0017_0F7E24BC15F2A318">
Another thing ob&s;ervable in the text is, the nece&s;&s;ity of boldne&s;s, or fortitude, in order to a faithful di&s;charge of the mini&s;terial office; &s;ug|ge&s;ted in tho&s;e words, "That I may open my mouth boldly to make known," &amp;c.</P>
<P>And it was peculiarly nece&s;&s;ary, in the fir&s;t times of the Go&s;pel, that mini&s;ters &s;hould be bold and couragious; as they were then eminently expo&s;ed to di&s;couragements and hazards, which are the proper occa&s;ions for the exerci&s;e of for|titude, and render it a u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary vir|tue. The Apo&s;tle Paul was an "Emba&s;&s;ador in bonds", when he wrote my text: Nor was it an uncommon thing, in tho&s;e days, for chri&s;tian mini&s;ters to be hated, reviled, and per&s;ecuted, for their freedom and hone&s;ty in "making known the my&s;tery of the Go&s;pel". And tis ea&s;y to &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of boldne&s;s in the&s;e mini&s;ters, who could not execute their tru&s;t without hazarding the lo&s;s of every thing that was dear and valua|ble to them.</P>
<P>But tho' fortitude was eminently nece&s;&s;ary at fir&s;t, it is not a u&s;ele&s;s quality now; but highly requi&s;ite in all who would con&s;cientiou&s;ly "ful|fil the mini&s;try they have received of the Lord". 'Tis true, chri&s;tian mini&s;ters are not <HI>now</HI> in dan|ger, at lea&s;t in prote&s;tant countries, of &s;tripes, or impri&s;onment, much le&s;s of the "fiery tryal", for the Go&s;pel's &s;ake: But they have notwith|&s;tanding difficulties to encounter, which will give opportunity to the exerci&s;e of courage: And if they are not, for a good degree, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this virtue, they will &s;hamefully fall &s;hort in the di&s;|charge of their duty.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="010256_0018_0F7E24BDF361D2E8">
Not that they will have any great need of <HI>fortitude,</HI> if they have nothing higher in their view than to gain popular admiration and accep|tance, with the plea&s;ing and profitable advantages that are u&s;ually the attendants on them. They may ea&s;ily avoid difficulties, if they can bring them&s;elves &s;ordidly to &s;tudy the humors of men; making it their great bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;ooth them in their prejudices, and flatter them in their fal&s;e opinions, and vicious practices. But if, in&s;tead of being "the &s;ervants of men", they would be "the &s;ervants of Chri&s;t"; approving them&s;elves faithful as "&s;tewards of the my&s;teries of his kingdom", they will certainly meet with di&s;cour|agements that will try their faith, and patience; yea, and their <HI>courage</HI> too. It cannot indeed be otherwi&s;e, morally &s;peaking, while there is, in the world, &s;o much infidelity and wickedne&s;s, on the one hand; and &s;o much &s;uper&s;tition, error, and bigottry, on the other, accompanied with a &s;pirit inclining men to "bitterne&s;s and wrath, anger, and clamor, and evil-&s;peaking". If a chri&s;tian mini&s;ter would faithfully "make known the my&s;|tery of the Go&s;pel". i. e. the pure and uncor|rupted truths of chri&s;tianity, he mu&s;t oppo&s;e not only the lu&s;ts of men, but their fal&s;e &s;entiments, however &s;trongly they may be attached to them, whether from ignorance, prejudice, or whatever other cau&s;e: And, in return for his hone&s;t free|dom, he may depend upon being loaded with hard names, and treated as one that has bad de|&s;igns. Thus it has been with many a faithful preacher of the truth, in its purity and &s;impli|city: Nor is this any other than we have been
<PB N="21" REF="010256_0019_0F7E24BE6F0EC0C0">
forewarned of, by the &s;pirit of prophecy. Hence that of the Apo&s;tle Paul, 2 Tim. 4. 3. "The time will come, when they will not endure &s;ound doctrine; but after their own lu&s;ts, &s;hall heap to them&s;elves teachers, having itching ears: And they &s;hall turn away their ears from the truth unto fables".</P>
<P>Not but that prudence is a nece&s;&s;ary quality to be found in mini&s;ters, as well as fortitude. They &s;hould wi&s;ely endeavour, as far as in them lies, con&s;i&s;tently with faithfulne&s;s to their tru&s;t, "to become all things to all men"; needle&s;sly "giving offence neither to Jew, nor Greek, nor the church of God": But labouring to "plea&s;e all men, in all things; not &s;eeking their own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be &s;aved"; as the Apo&s;tle Paul tells us he did, 1 Cor. 10. 32, 33. But yet, they &s;hould not, under the di&s;gui&s;e of prudence, cowardly keep &s;ilence, when they are called of God to &s;peak the truth, whe|ther in the way of "reproof", or "exhortati|on", or "doctrine": Tho' even here, "wi&s;dom is profitable to direct"; and, under the guidance of it, mini&s;ters &s;hould take all due care to ob&s;erve times and &s;ea&s;ons, and that manner of addre&s;s with which, if any are offended, it mu&s;t be their own fault. And, under the&s;e limitations, they &s;hould hone&s;tly and frankly &s;peak the truth, tho' it &s;hould unhappily prove the occa&s;ion of preju|dice and hatred in people; tho' they &s;hould on this account, e&s;teem them as "enemies", and behave towards them with anger and clamour. And in order to their being thus faithful, bold|ne&s;s is the virtue they mu&s;t have in readine&s;s to
<PB N="22" REF="010256_0020_0F7E24BF3870E5F8">
exerci&s;e: Otherwi&s;e, they will &s;oon &s;ink under di&s;couragement; or, what is wor&s;e, their "ex|hortation will be in guile, as plea&s;ing man, and not God, who trieth the heart". They will never be able, unle&s;s they are endowed with this grace, and in a good mea&s;ure too, meekly to en|dure obloquy and reproach, neglect and contempt; committing their cau&s;e to God, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing their &s;ouls in patience, even tho' the more they endeavour to promote the go&s;pel, the more they are vilified and abu&s;ed. Fortitude is the grace, above all others, that is peculiarly fitted, under &s;uch circum&s;tances, to urge them on with life and vigor in pro&s;ecution of their duty: And by the help of it, under the influence of the divine Spirit, they will &s;teadily maintain their &s;tation, and faithfully per&s;i&s;t in their cour&s;e; being able to triumph in &s;uch language as that, "None of the&s;e things move me, neither count I my life dear to my&s;elf, &s;o that I might fini&s;h my cour&s;e with joy, and the mini&s;try which I have received of the Lord Je&s;us, to te&s;tify the go&s;pel of the grace of God."&mdash;No wonder then the apo&s;tle is &s;o de|&s;irous of the prayer of good chri&s;tians, that he might be thus "bold to make known the my&s;|tery of the go&s;pel."&mdash;But this leads me</P>
<P>To the la&s;t thing ob&s;ervable in the text, which is, the propriety and fitne&s;s of people's praying for mini&s;ters; e&s;pecially that they may execute their tru&s;t with re&s;olution and fortitude. Says the apo&s;tle in my text, "praying for me al&s;o, that I may open my mouth boldly to make known the my&s;tery of the go&s;pel." And &s;uch an opinion had he of the advantage of the prayers
<PB N="23" REF="010256_0021_0F7E24BFD2E31540">
of good chri&s;tians, that he never forgot, upon proper occa&s;ions, to &s;ignify his de&s;ire of their remembrance, not only of him, but of his fel|low-labourers al&s;o in the go&s;pel, before the throne of mercy. When he wrote his epi&s;tle to the Colo&s;&s;ians, exhorting them, among other things, "to continue in prayer", he could not help ad|ding, "withal praying al&s;o for us, that God would open unto us a door of utterance to &s;peak the my&s;tery of Chri&s;t". So, when he wrote to the The&s;&s;alonians, he could not break off without in&s;erting &s;uch a clau&s;e as that, "Brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have free cour&s;e, and be glorified". And, in his epi&s;tle to the Romans, there is nothing he expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf more &s;olemnly and earne&s;tly upon, than this of their praying for him. "I be&s;eech you, brethren," &s;ays he, "for the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;ake, and for the love of the &s;pirit, that ye &s;trive together with me, in your prayers for me".</P>
<P>And if "&s;upplications, prayers and interce&s;&s;i|ons" are to be "made for all men", as being "good and acceptable in the &s;ight of God our Saviour";&mdash;much more ought they to be made for tho&s;e who are put in tru&s;t with the Go&s;pel: For their work, con&s;idered in this capacity, lies chiefly in promoting the cau&s;e of truth and reli|gion: So that to pray for them is, in reality of con&s;truction, to pray for the flouri&s;hing of God's kingdom of truth, righteou&s;ne&s;s and holine&s;s. And 'tis certainly fit and rea&s;onable, that this &s;hould be one of the principal &s;ubjects of peo|ples prayers to almighty God.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="010256_0022_0F7E24C31674D720">
And as mini&s;ters are expo&s;ed to peculiar diffi|culties and di&s;couragements, which call for pro|portionable degrees of holy re&s;olution and chri&s;|tian fortitude, they &s;tand more in need of the prayers of all lovers of truth and virtue, than other men: and they ought accordingly to be more particularly mindful of them, in their ap|plications to the throne of grace, that they may be di&s;po&s;ed and enabled to "make known the my&s;tery of the Go&s;pel", with a becoming free|dom, hone&s;ty and boldne&s;s.</P>
<P>And it is e&s;pecially the duty of people to pray for their own mini&s;ters; as in praying for them they virtually pray for them&s;elves, i. e. their own &s;piritual and eternal good. For, if thro' their prayers, their mini&s;ters are faithful, diligent, and couragious in di&s;charging the various duties of their office, this good they will be under the be&s;t advantages to receive, by means of their mini&s;try. And if God &s;hall be plea&s;ed to pro&s;per their la|bours to the increa&s;e of true knowledge and real virtue, they are the per&s;ons that will be profited hereby: than which there cannot be a &s;tronger enforcement, even upon the principle of &s;elf-intere&s;t, to the duty of people's praying for their mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only add, that they &s;hould pray for them, "always, with all prayer and &s;upplication in the &s;pirit". They &s;hould pray for them "al|ways": Not &s;trictly and literally &s;peaking; for this would be incon&s;i&s;tent with many other du|ties, which they are equally obliged to perform, both with reference to them, and others, as well as them&s;elves: But the meaning is, that they
<PB N="25" REF="010256_0023_0F7E24C3C7937018">
&s;hould "always" keep their minds in a di&s;po&s;ition proper for prayer, and actually put it in exerci&s;e as &s;uitable occa&s;ions are offered therefor. And they &s;hould pray "with all prayer and &s;upplication", i. e. with all kinds of prayer, &s;ocial and &s;olitary; &s;tated and ejaculatory: and with all kinds of &s;upplication, with &s;upplication for outward and &s;piritual mercies, but e&s;pecially for a&s;&s;i&s;tance and &s;ucce&s;s in their work as mini&s;ters. And in fine, they &s;hould thus pray "in the &s;pirit". i. e. as excited, enlivened, and influenced by the Spirit of God: Or the meaning may be, their hearts &s;hould be engaged in this duty of prayer for mini&s;ters. They &s;hould not pray for them in a formal dead manner; but with life and Spirit, as tho&s;e that are in earne&s;t, and &s;incerely and ar|dently de&s;ire, that their prayers &s;hould be heard and accepted.&mdash;But I may not enlarge.&mdash;</P>
<P>I might now profitably take occa&s;ion, from what has been di&s;cour&s;ed, to dilate on the importance of the mini&s;terial tru&s;t;&mdash;the &s;uperior qualifica|tions requi&s;ite to be found in tho&s;e, who may warrantably have it committed to them;&mdash;the in&s;ufficiency of the be&s;t qualified mini&s;ters, in their own &s;ingle &s;trength, faithfully to di&s;charge the duties of their office;&mdash;the need they &s;tand in of the &s;pecial a&s;&s;i&s;tances of divine grace, and the importunity with which they &s;hould apply to God for the be&s;towment of them.&mdash;And I might al&s;o &s;ea&s;onably urge it upon people, as their intere&s;t and duty, "to &s;trive with mini&s;ters in their prayers to God for them".&mdash;But the&s;e things, for want of time, I mu&s;t leave you to enlarge

upon in your own private meditations, and con|clude by turning the di&s;cour&s;e into a particular addre&s;s to the per&s;on who is now to be &s;et apart to the work of the mini&s;try, and to the people who are to be his more &s;pecial charge.</P>
<P>To you, <HI>Sir,</HI> I would briefly &s;ay;&mdash;We tru&s;t, it is becau&s;e "Chri&s;t has counted you faithful", that he has &s;o far, in his providence, prepared the way for your being "put into the mini&s;try": And it is becau&s;e we are well &s;atisfied of your mini&s;terial accompli&s;hments, that we can cheer|fully act, in Chri&s;t's name, and according to his appointment, in entru&s;ting you with the di&s;pen|&s;ation of the Go&s;pel. And it is our united ar|dent prayer to "the God who dwelleth on high", that you may continually increa&s;e in all the gifts and graces that are nece&s;&s;ary in order to your being "perfect" as a "man of God", and "throughly furni&s;hed" for the mo&s;t advantage|ous di&s;charge of all the duties of your calling.</P>
<P>Your work, as a Go&s;pel-mini&s;ter, will princi|pally lie in "making known the my&s;teries of chri&s;tianity". And as the&s;e are contained, origi|nally and infallibly, in the &s;acred writings only, the&s;e you will make your chief &s;tudy; con&s;ult|ing the writings of men only as an help in or|der to your under&s;tanding the &s;cripture, and re|garding them no otherwi&s;e than as they agree with this only unerring te&s;t of revealed truth. And having, from the pure word of God, form|ed your &s;entiments of the divine my&s;teries, the&s;e you will make the grand &s;ubjects of your preach|ing. To be &s;ure, if you would acquit your&s;elf
<PB N="27" REF="010256_0025_0F7E24C5971DFFD0">
with honor, and fidelity, as a chri&s;tian mini&s;ter, you mu&s;t not mainly in&s;i&s;t upon points of meer rea&s;on; or lay out your time and pains in &s;ettling di&s;putes, which tend to "&s;trife", rather than "godly edifying"&punc; But you mu&s;t dwell on the great and important truths of the chri&s;tian reli|gion, tho&s;e "my&s;teries of God", which were "kept hid from ages and generations", but have been manife&s;ted by the Go&s;pel revelation. And as it is by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and him only, that "a new and living way" has been opened for the entrance of &s;inners into the holy heaven, HE &s;hould be the great &s;ubject of your di&s;cour&s;es. Their main &s;cope &s;hould be to unfold the "my&s;|tery of Chri&s;t", to explain to your people the go&s;pel-method of &s;alvation, by the interpo&s;ition of the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us, and the &s;everal offices he has &s;u&s;tained, and executed, in order to effect our everla&s;ting good.</P>
<P>Nor is it eno', that you "&s;peak the things which become &s;ound doctrine"; but you mu&s;t "&s;hew your&s;elf a pattern of good works"; being "an example of the believers, in word, in conver&s;a|tion, in charity, in &s;pirit, in faith, in purity". This was the direction of Paul to Timothy; nor could he have advi&s;ed to a more effectual expedient to give him influence as a preacher. There is a &s;trange virtue in exemplary goodne&s;s to gain upon the affections and con&s;ciences of people: It will, beyond the greate&s;t accompli&s;h|ments of learning, or the fine&s;t eloquence in &s;peaking, render the "man of God" amiable in the eyes of all that know him: And it will give
<PB N="28" REF="010256_0026_0F7E24C611236BB0">
a &s;ingular energy to his di&s;cour&s;es, whether in public or private. While he exhibits, in his be|haviour, a ju&s;t pattern of what he preaches, his doctrine will have a powerful tendency to &s;trike the minds of hearers with a divine force, and accompli&s;h the &s;aving ends to which it is de&s;igned.</P>
<P>And let me further advi&s;e you, <HI>dear Sir,</HI> to endeavour to pre&s;erve in your mind, as much as may be, a &s;erious and awakened &s;en&s;e of eter|nal concerns. This you will find an un&s;peaka|ble advantage, thro' the whole cour&s;e of your mini&s;try. It will enliven your meditations in your &s;tudy; it will give a pungency to your per|formances in the pulpit; and it will, more than almo&s;t any thing, &s;trengthen you under difficul|ties and di&s;couragements, and enable you to bear them with meekne&s;s and fortitude.</P>
<P>And the&s;e, let me add, you may depend upon meeting with, while you have to oppo&s;e the pa&s;&s;ions, the errors, the prejudices and lu&s;ts of men. You cannot faithfully do your duty, as a mini&s;ter, and yet pa&s;s thro' the world without difficulties of one kind or other, that will try your faith, your patience, your courage, and all your graces. But you have no rea&s;on to be di&s;|heartned.&mdash;You &s;erve a good ma&s;ter; you are engaged in a good cau&s;e. "Be &s;trong" therefore, "my &s;on, in the grace that is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us." "Do the work of an evangeli&s;t", and be willing to "endure affliction"; yea, "endure hardne&s;s as a good &s;oldier of Je&s;us Chri&s;t": And if you are bold in &s;tanding up for God, and the intere&s;t of true genuine chri&s;tianity; continuing "faithful

<P>I &s;carce need &s;ubjoin any thing to urge you to a becoming conduct towards the venerable pa&s;tor of this church, in a great mea&s;ure taken off from his labours, by rea&s;on of the infirmities of age. Your chri&s;tian good di&s;po&s;ition will prompt you to reverence his years, and treat him with the love and re&s;pect of a &s;on to a father; con&s;ulting him upon all proper occa&s;ions, paying a ju&s;t re|gard to his advice, and heartily concurring with him in all wi&s;e and &s;uitable methods for the ad|vancement of the Redeemer's intere&s;t. And it is our fervent prayer to the God of all grace, that you may be mutual helps and comforts to one another, and ble&s;&s;ings to this people; and that you may both have many of them for "your crown of rejoicing" in the day of the appearing of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>I now go on to direct a few words to the congregation u&s;ually meeting in this place. "Be|loved in the Lord", as it is not the de&s;ign of the tran&s;actions of this day to &s;upercede the obliga|tions you are under to him, who has been, for more than forty years, "your &s;ervant for Chri&s;t's &s;ake", we tru&s;t you will &s;till "highly e&s;teem him in love" for his &s;ervices that have tended, and
<PB N="30" REF="010256_0028_0F7E24C764EA0ED8">
may yet tend, to promote the &s;piritual and eter|nal good of you, and you's: And we think bet|ter of you, than to &s;u&s;pect that you will complain of him, if he &s;hould not be able, with former frequency and vigor, to di&s;pen&s;e the word and ordinances of Chri&s;t to you. You will rather endeavour to render his life, which, according to the cour&s;e of nature, is drawing to a clo&s;e, as ea&s;y and comfortable to him as may be: Not forgetting to bear him on your hearts, when before the throne of mercy; but earne&s;t|ly imploring the God who&s;e he is, and whom, we tru&s;t, he has faithfully &s;erved in the go&s;pel of his &s;on, to make him u&s;eful and faithful, even to the end; that, "when the time of his depar|ture is at hand", he may be able to &s;ay with tri|umph, "I have fought a good fight, I have fini&s;h|ed my cour&s;e, I have kept the faith: Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteou&s;ne&s;s, which the Lord, the righteous judge &s;hall give me in that day".</P>
<P>And as to the per&s;on now to be introduced in|to the mini&s;terial office, as a "fellow-helper" to your other pa&s;tor upon his decline in life, we heartily recommend him to your affectionate re|gards; rejoicing with you in the hopeful pro&s;|pect you have of a &s;ingular ble&s;&s;ing in him. Do what you can to encourage him in his work.&mdash;Free him, as much as may be, from the cares of the world, that he may "give him&s;elf wholly to reading, meditation and prayer". And let me a&s;&s;ure you, you will find your account in &s;o do|ing&punc; for, by this means, he will be able to pro|vide
<PB N="31" REF="010256_0029_0F7E24C8123F14E0">
the better for your &s;ouls.&mdash;Think it not &s;trange, if you &s;hould di&s;cern frailties and imper|fections in him: for this is no other than you ought to expect; as he is, in common with all mini&s;ters, "a man of like pa&s;&s;ions with your &s;elves". Don't be offended, if he &s;hould deal plainly and faithfully with you; but value him the more highly for his hone&s;ty and integrity.&mdash;Cheri&s;h the affection you bear towards him, and don't needle&s;ly &s;uffer it to grow cold.&mdash;Be upon your guard, that no prejudices again&s;t him enter into your minds: This will be, not only a di&s;|advantage to him, but a great damage to your &s;elves. For &s;hould he preach and live like an angel, it would not be likely, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, that he &s;hould do you much good.&mdash;And let me par|ticularly recommend it to you to be con&s;tant and earne&s;t in your prayers to God for him; "pray|ing always, with all prayer and &s;upplication in the &s;pirit, that he may open his mouth boldly to make known the my&s;tery of the go&s;pel" to you. Make daily mention of him in your clo&s;ets, and in your families, that he may be a rich ble&s;&s;ing to you, and to your children. And if, upon pro|per occa&s;ions, you made it your &s;pecial errand to the throne of mercy, to a&s;k the pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t with him in his work, you would not find it mi&s;pent time.&mdash;Above all, take care that you reap &s;piritual profit under his mini&s;try. Think it not enough, that you hear the word as di&s;pen&s;ed by him. This alone won't be &s;uffici|ent. It mu&s;t have its proper influence both on your hearts, and your lives. In order whereto,
<PB N="32" REF="010256_0030_0F7E24CA662FFC58">
let your minds be open to in&s;truction.&mdash;Be ready to embrace "the truth in the love of it".&mdash;Receive the word with "meekne&s;s and faith"; and be ever willing to yield obedience to it: So will you be the "joy" of your pa&s;tor here, and "his crown" in the day of the manife&s;tation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>And now, may we all, both mini&s;ters and people, behave like chri&s;tians in our re&s;pective &s;ta|tions! remembering that we have but a day al|lowed us, and a &s;hort one too. Tis probable, we &s;hall never all of us be together again in any a&s;&s;embly here on earth; but we &s;hall 'ere long meet in a much larger a&s;&s;embly, and upon a much more &s;olemn and important occa&s;ion, that of giving up an account of our "doings in the body" to the great "judge of quick and dead". The good Lord &s;olemnize this &s;erious awful truth to each one of our hearts, that we may be effectually engaged &s;o to conduct our&s;elves in this time of our tryal, as that, when we meet a|gain at the great and general judgment, we may be pronounced "good and faithful &s;ervants", and be bid "to enter into the joy of our Lord". AMEN and AMEN.</P>

<HEAD>THE Right Hand of Fellow&s;hip;</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By the Rev. Mr. COOPER.</BYLINE>
<P>WORDS are not the only medium of communicating our thoughts: Actions and ge&s;tures have an emphatic mean|ing, and are capable of greatly height|ning the expre&s;&s;ion and force of our verbal de|clarations.</P>
<P>Giving the right hand is a natural indication, and has long been an e&s;tabli&s;h'd pledge, of friend|&s;hip and mutual a&s;&s;i&s;tance. This ceremony has not only pa&s;s'd into our common forms of civility, but is us'd among us, as it was among the ancients, upon &s;ome of the mo&s;t important and &s;olemn occa|&s;ions. The apo&s;tles of our Lord introduc'd it into the chri&s;tian church; and by their example we are allow'd to u&s;e it, as a &s;ymbol of that peculiar affection, and &s;acred fellow&s;hip, that ought for|ever to be maintain'd among the churches of Chri&s;t, and e&s;pecially the mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel of peace. Thus <HI>James, Cephas,</HI> and <HI>John, gave unto Paul and Barnabas the Right Hand of Fellow&s;hip.</HI></P>
<P>The congregational churches in New-England, ambitious of conforming to the model of the truly primitive and apo&s;tolic church, have ever
<PB N="38" REF="010256_0036_0F7E24D255AF0E50">
accompanied the &s;olemn ordination of a pa&s;tor with this &s;ignificant rite.</P>
<P>Accordingly, by the appointment of the ve|nerable council here pre&s;ent, and in the name of my brethren in the mini&s;try, I give unto you, my brother, this Right Hand of Fellow&s;hip; as a token of the &s;atisfaction we take in your qua|lifications for the go&s;pel mini&s;try, and your re|gular induction into it, by which you are become ve&s;ted with all the authority that properly be|longs to the pa&s;toral character.</P>
<P>You now hold a pledge of our e&s;teem and love for you; of our fellow&s;hip with you, and our readine&s;s to afford you, as occa&s;ions may require, all tho&s;e aids and encouragements, which you have a right to expect, as a fellow labourer with us in the work of the Lord, and our <HI>companion in the kingdom and patience of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Permit me at the &s;ame time to remind you, that this action, like the obligations it expre&s;&s;es, is mutual; and that I have al&s;o received your right hand, in confidence of a reciprocal affecti|on, and that you will not fail to return to us, what we promi&s;e unto you. The honour of our di|vine ma&s;ter, the &s;ucce&s;s of his &s;ervice, the intere&s;t of the churches confided to our care, and our own &s;upport under the temptations and di&s;courage|ments that attend our &s;acred employment&mdash;all demand, that the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t &s;hould thus be <HI>knit together in love.</HI> May nothing di&s;&s;olve, or weaken this happy union!</P>
<P>And now my Brother, the grace of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t be with your &s;pirit! And while you &s;erve, as a &s;on in the go&s;pel, with your reverend
<PB N="39" REF="010256_0037_0F7E24D3170A1DF8">
colleague, and enjoy the advantage of his expe|rience and coun&s;els, may the prudence, fidelity, and &s;ucce&s;s of your mini&s;try, be a con&s;olation to his age, and add to the peace of his death.</P>
<P>God prolong your life, and render it precious to the people of your charge: May <HI>the ear that hears you, ble&s;s you; and the eye that &s;ees you bear witne&s;s to you!</HI>&mdash;May he, who <HI>holdeth the &s;tars in his right hand,</HI> &s;upport and guide you in a &s;hining cour&s;e of per&s;onal &s;anctity, and pub|lic u&s;efulne&s;s; and grant that you may <HI>both &s;ave your&s;elf, and them that hear you!</HI></P>
<P>United by the bonds of love to this chri&s;tian &s;ociety, we rejoice, brethren, in your happy una|nimity; we take part in the &s;atisfaction which this day's pro&s;pect affords you; and we <HI>&s;alute you much in the Lord.</HI> May <HI>the &s;pirit of glory and of God re&s;t upon you!</HI> May your affection to your pa&s;tors continue and increa&s;e, and ever be accompanied with the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial evi|dences of the &s;ucce&s;s of their holy mini&s;trations; that you and your children may be their <HI>joy, and crown of rejoicing, in the pre&s;ence of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t at his coming.</HI></P>
<P>The mini&s;try which Chri&s;t has e&s;tabli&s;h'd, and the exerci&s;es of piety which his go&s;pel enjoins, are preparatory, under the influences of the holy Spirit, to a &s;tate of immortality and joy: God grant, that by a lively faith in the Redeemer of men, and a devout attendance upon his in&s;titu|tions, we may all be prepar'd to pa&s;s from the inferior &s;tate of the church on earth, to the <HI>general a&s;&s;embly on high, and to the &s;pirits of ju&s;t men made perfect.</HI></P>
