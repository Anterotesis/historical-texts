</EPIGRAPH>
<P>COncerning the&s;e Words I would ob&s;erve three Things, 1. On what Occa&s;ion that was, that we have an Account of in the Text; It was on Occa&s;ion of the Death of <HI>John the Bapti&s;t,</HI> who was a Per&s;on who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s it had been to preach the Go&s;pel of the Kingdom of God; He was a Mini&s;ter of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and had been impro|ved to do great Service, was an In&s;trument of much good to many in <HI>Judea</HI> and <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> in his Life Time. He was cruelly murthered by <HI>Herod,</HI> at the In&s;tigation of <HI>Herodias,</HI> having expo&s;ed him&s;elf to her Malice by faithfully reproving them for their ince&s;tuous Wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P N="2">2. We may ob&s;erve who are the Per&s;ons &s;poken of in the Text; they were tho&s;e that had been the Di&s;ciples of <HI>John the Bapti&s;t,</HI> that had &s;at at his Feet to hear him preach the Go&s;pel, that were his con&s;tant Followers, that were with him as tho&s;e that received great Benefit, by his Mini&s;try, and were as it were his Children.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="6" REF="004712_0003_100DC4599F5F7E80">3. We may ob&s;erve their Behaviour on this Occa&s;ion, con&s;i&s;ting in two Things.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) That whereby they &s;hewed their Regard to the Remains of the decea&s;ed, <HI>They took up the Body and bu|ried it:</HI> It had been u&s;ed in a barbarous Manner by others, that had al&s;o been his Hearers, and were under &s;pecial Obligations to have treated him with Honour. They cruelly murder'd him, by &s;evering his Head from his Body; and his Head was carried in a Charger to <HI>Herodias,</HI> that &s;he, in&s;tead of paying that Re&s;pect that was due to the Remains of &s;o venerable a Per&s;on, might have her Malice and Cruelty gratified by &s;uch a Specta|cle, and that &s;he might thence take Occa&s;ion to in&s;ult the Dead. While that Part of the dead Body was thus u&s;ed by <HI>Herodias,</HI> his Di&s;ciples out of Re&s;pect and Ho|nour to their Ma&s;ter and Teacher, decently inter the Re&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) That which they did, con&s;equent on this, for God's Glory and their own Good, <HI>They went and told Je&s;us.</HI> Him they knew to be one that their Ma&s;ter <HI>John,</HI> while he lived, had te&s;tified a great Regard to. <HI>Je&s;us</HI> was he who&s;e Forerunner <HI>John</HI> was; whom he had preach'd, and of whom he had &s;aid, <HI>Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the Sin of the World:</HI> And <HI>This is he, of whom I &s;aid, after me cometh one that is preferred before me</HI>; and whom he &s;aw, and bare Re|cord that <HI>this is the Son of God.</HI> And probably they knew that Chri&s;t was one that had put great Honour upon <HI>John</HI> their Teacher in his Life-time. For he, though he was the Son of God, and <HI>John</HI>'s Maker and Saviour, yet came to him to be baptized of him, and had &s;aid of him, that <HI>among tho&s;e that were born of Wo|men, there had not ri&s;en a greater than John the Bapti&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>It was now a &s;orrowful Time with <HI>John</HI>'s Di&s;ciples; when they were thus bereaved of him who&s;e Teachings they had &s;at under. And the Manner of his Death was doubtle&s;s very grievous to them. They were like a Company of &s;orrowful, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, bereaved Children;
<PB N="7" REF="004712_0004_100DC45CA7E39410">
and what do they do in their Sorrows, but go to <HI>Je&s;us</HI> with their Complaint. The fir&s;t Thing that they do, after paying proper Regards to the Remains of their dear Ma&s;ter, is to go to Chri&s;t, to &s;pread their Ca&s;e before him &s;eeking Comfort and Help from him. <HI>Thus they &s;ought their own Benefit.</HI></P>
<P>And probably one End of their immediately going and telling Je&s;us was, that he being informed of it, might conduct him&s;elf accordingly, as his Wi&s;dom &s;hould direct, for the Intere&s;t of his own Kingdom. When &s;o great a Per&s;on as <HI>John the Bapti&s;t</HI> the Forerunner of Chri&s;t was thus martyr'd, it was a great Event, in which the com|mon Cau&s;e, in which both Chri&s;t and he were engaged, was greatly concern'd: It was therefore fit that he that was at the Head of the whole Affair &s;hould be informed of it, for his future Conduct in the Affairs of his King|dom. And accordingly we find that Je&s;us &s;eems imme|diately to be influenced in his Conduct by the&s;e Tidings; as you may &s;ee in the next Ver&s;e, <HI>When Je&s;us heard of it he departed thence by Ship into a de&s;art Place apart.</HI> Thus <HI>John</HI>'s Di&s;ciples <HI>&s;ought God's Glory.</HI></P>
<P>The Ob&s;ervation from the Words that I would make the Subject of my Di&s;cour&s;e at this Time is this,</P>
<P><Q>When any one is taken away by Death, that has been eminent in the Work of the Go&s;pel-Mi|ni&s;try, &s;uch as are thereby bereaved, &s;hould go and &s;pread their Calamity before Je&s;us.</Q></P>
<P>Though in handling this Subject I might particularly &s;peak to &s;everal <HI>Propo&s;itions</HI> that are contained in this Ob|&s;ervation, and many Things might profitably be in&s;i&s;ted on under it, if there were Room for it within the Com|pa&s;s of a Sermon; yet I &s;hall only give the <HI>Rea&s;ons of the Doctrine,</HI> and then ha&s;ten to the Application.</P>
<P>The following <HI>Rea&s;ons</HI> may be given why, in Ca&s;e of &s;uch an awful Di&s;pen&s;ation of Providence, tho&s;e that
<PB N="8" REF="004712_0005_100DC45ED6F3FA00">
are concerned in it, and bereaved by it, &s;hould go and &s;pread their Sorrows before Je&s;us.</P>
<P N="1">1. Chri&s;t is one <HI>that is ready to pity the afflicted.</HI> 'Tis natural for Per&s;ons that are bereaved of any that are dear to 'em, and for all under deep Sorrow, to &s;eek &s;ome that they may declare and lay open their Griefs to, that they have good Rea&s;on to think will pity 'em, and have a Fellow-feeling with them of their Di&s;tre&s;s. The Heart that is full of Grief wants Vent, and de&s;ires to pour out its Complaint; but it &s;eeks a compa&s;&s;ionate Friend to pour it out before.</P>
<P>Chri&s;t is &s;uch an one, above all others. He of old, before his Incarnation manife&s;ted him&s;elf full of Compa&s;|&s;ion towards his People; for that is Je&s;us that is &s;poken of I&s;a. 63.9. <HI>In all their Affliction he was afflicted; and and the Angel of his Pre&s;ence &s;aved them; in his Love and in his Pity he redeemed them; and he bare them, and car|ried them all the Days of old.</HI> And when he was upon Earth in his State of Humiliation. He was the mo&s;t wonderful In&s;tance of a tender, pitiful, compa&s;&s;ionate Spirit that ever appeared in the World. How often are we told of his having Compa&s;&s;ion on one and another? So Matth. 15.32. <HI>Then Je&s;us called his Di&s;ciples, and &s;aid unto them, I have Compa&s;&s;ion on the Multitude.</HI> So he had Compa&s;&s;ion on the Man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with Devils, Mark 5.19. <HI>Go home to thy Friends, and tell them how great Things the Lord hath done to thee, and hath had</HI> Compa&s;&s;ion <HI>on thee.</HI> So we read of his pitying the Mo|ther, that was bereaved of her Son, <HI>Luke</HI> 7.13. There we have an Account, when Chri&s;t went into the City of <HI>Nain,</HI> and met the People carrying out a dead Man, the only Son of his Mother, that was a Widow, that when he &s;aw her he had Compa&s;&s;ion on her. So when the two blind Men that &s;at by the Way-&s;ide, cried to Je&s;us, as he pa&s;&s;ed by, &s;aying, <HI>Have Mercy on us, O Lord, thou Son of David.</HI> We read that Je&s;us had Com|pa&s;&s;ion
<PB N="9" REF="004712_0006_100DC4605BD29AB8">
on them, Matth&punc; 20.39. So we read of his be|ing <HI>moved with Compa&s;&s;ion,</HI> Matth. 14.14. <HI>And Je&s;us went forth, and &s;aw a great Multitude, and when he &s;aw them he was moved with Compa&s;&s;ion.</HI> His Speeches to his Di&s;ciples were full of Compa&s;&s;ion; e&s;pecially tho&s;e that he utter'd a little before his Death, of which we have an Account in the 13, 14, 15, &amp; 16. Chapters of <HI>John.</HI> His Miracles were almo&s;t univer&s;ally Deeds of Pity to Per&s;ons under Affliction.</P>
<P>And &s;eeing &s;uch a pitiful Heart appeared in him on all Occa&s;ions, no Wonder that <HI>John</HI>'s Di&s;ciples when be|reaved of their dear Guide and Teacher, and their Hearts were full of Sorrow, came to him for Pity: Which likewi&s;e induc'd <HI>Mary</HI> and <HI>Martha</HI> to come and fall down pouring out their Tears at Je&s;us Feet, when their dear Brother <HI>Lazarus</HI> was dead: Other Jews came to comfort them, before Je&s;us came, whom they little re|garded, but when they heard that Je&s;us was come, they &s;oon go and &s;pread their Sorrows before him; they were a&s;&s;ured that he would pity 'em; and their Expectation was not fru&s;trated; for he was mo&s;t tenderly affected and moved at their Tears: We are told that on that Oc|ca&s;ion he groaned in Spirit and was troubled, <HI>John</HI> 11.33. And when he came to the Grave, 'tis ob&s;erved, and a &s;pecial Note &s;eems to be &s;et upon it, that <HI>he wept,</HI> Ver. 35.</P>
<P>He was one that wept with tho&s;e that wept. And indeed it was meer Pity that brought him into the World, and induced him not only to &s;hed Tears but to &s;hed his Blood: He poured out his Blood as Water on the Earth, out of Compa&s;&s;ion to the poor mi&s;erable Children of Men. And when do we ever read of any one Per&s;on coming to him when on Earth, with an heavy Heart, or under <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Kind of Sorrow or Di&s;tre&s;s for Pity or
<PB N="10" REF="004712_0007_100DC461E4419DC0">
Help, but what met with a Kind and compa&s;&s;ionate Reception?</P>
<P>And he has the <HI>&s;ame Compa&s;&s;ion</HI> now he is <HI>a&s;cended into Glory</HI>: There is &s;till the &s;ame Encouragement for bereaved Ones to go and &s;pread their Sorrows before him.</P>
<P>Afflicted Per&s;ons love to &s;peak of their Sorrows to them that have had <HI>Experience</HI> of Affliction, and know what Sorrow is: But there is none on Earth or in Heaven that ever had &s;o much Experience of Sorrow as Chri&s;t: Therefore he <HI>knows how to pity</HI> the &s;orrowful, and e&s;pe|cially may we be confident that he is ready to pity tho&s;e that are bereaved of a <HI>faithful Mini&s;ter,</HI> be|cau&s;e &s;uch a Bereavement is a Calamity that con|cerns the <HI>Souls of Men</HI>; and Chri&s;t hath e&s;pecially &s;hewn his Pity to Men's Souls; for it was chiefly for them that he died: To relieve the Mi&s;eries of the Soul e&s;pecially, is it that he hath provided; and it was from Pity to the Souls of Men that he made that Provi&s;ion for them that he hath done, in appointing &s;uch an Order of Men as <HI>Go&s;pel-Mini&s;ters,</HI> and in &s;ending them forth to preach the Go&s;pel: It was becau&s;e he had Compa&s;&s;ion on Men's Souls, that he hath appointed Mini&s;ters to watch for Souls.</P>
<P N="2">2. Chri&s;t <HI>has purcha&s;ed all that Per&s;ons need under &s;uch a Bereavement.</HI> He has purchas'd all that mi&s;erable Men &s;tand in Need of under all their Calamities, and comfort under every Sort of Affliction: And therefore his Invi|tation to tho&s;e <HI>that Labour and are heavy laden,</HI> to come to him for Re&s;t, may be under&s;tood in the mo&s;t exten&s;ive Sen&s;e, to extend to tho&s;e that <HI>labour</HI> under any Kind of Burden of Sin or Sorrow, and to all that are <HI>heavy laden</HI> with either natural or moral Evil: He has purcha&s;ed divine Cordials and Supports for tho&s;e Hearts that are rea|dy
<PB N="11" REF="004712_0008_100DC4641B1931E0">
to &s;ink: He has purcha&s;ed all needed Comfort and Help for the Widow and the Fatherle&s;s: He has pur|cha&s;ed a &s;anctified Improvement and Fruit of Affliction, for all &s;uch as come to him, and &s;pread their Sorrows be|fore him: He has purcha&s;ed tho&s;e Things that are &s;uf|ficient to make up their Lo&s;s, that are bereaved of a great Ble&s;&s;ing in an eminent Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel: 'Tis he that has purcha&s;ed tho&s;e divine Ble&s;&s;ings, tho&s;e Influ|ences and Fruits of the Spirit of God, that the Work of the Mini&s;try is appointed to be the Means of: Faithful Mini&s;ters <HI>them&s;elves</HI> are the <HI>Fruits of his Purcha&s;e</HI>; and he has purcha&s;ed all tho&s;e <HI>Gifts and Graces</HI> whereby Mi|ni&s;ters do become faithful, eminent and &s;ucce&s;sful; and therefore <HI>when he a&s;cended up on high, he received</HI> &s;uch <HI>Gifts for Men</HI>; Eph. 4.8. &amp;c. &mdash; So that he has pur|cha&s;ed all that is needful to make up for the Lo&s;s that is &s;u&s;tained by the Death of an eminent Mini&s;ter.</P>
<P N="3">3. Chri&s;t <HI>is able to afford all that Help that is needed in &s;uch a Ca&s;e.</HI> His Power and his Wi&s;dom are as &s;uf|ficient as his Purcha&s;e, and an&s;werable to his Compa&s;&s;i|ons. By the Bowels of his Mercies, the Love and Ten|derne&s;s of his Heart, he is di&s;po&s;ed to help tho&s;e that are in Affliction; and his Ability is an&s;werable to his Di&s;|po&s;ition. He is able to &s;upport the Heart under the hea|vie&s;t Sorrows, and to give Light in the greate&s;t Dark|ne&s;s: He can divide the thicke&s;t Cloud with Beams of heavenly Light and Comfort: He is one that gives <HI>Songs in the Night,</HI> and <HI>turns the Shadow of Death into the Morning</HI>: He has Power to make up the Lo&s;s of tho&s;e that are bereaved by the Death of the mo&s;t emi|nent Mini&s;ter. His own Pre&s;ence with the bereaved is &s;ufficient; if the great Shepherd and Bi&s;hop of Souls be pre&s;ent, how much more is this than enough to &s;upply the Want of any under Shepherd? And then he is able to furni&s;h others with like Gifts and Graces for that Work.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="004712_0009_100DC4679CC6DA10">Per&s;ons under &s;orrowful Bereavements are ready to go and lay open their Sorrows to them that they think will be ready to pity them, though they know they can but pity them, and cant help them. How much more is here in &s;uch a Ca&s;e to induce us to go to <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> who is not only &s;o ready to pity, but &s;o able to help, able abun|dantly more than to fill up the Breach, and able to turn all our Sorrows into Joy?</P>
<P N="4">4. The <HI>Con&s;ideration of the &s;pecial Office of Chri&s;t, and the Work that he has undertaken for his People,</HI> &s;hould en|gage them to go and &s;pread &s;uch a Calamity, as the Be|reavement of a faithful and eminent Mini&s;ter, before him: For he is the <HI>Head of the Body,</HI> the great Shep|herd of the Sheep, and Lord of the Harve&s;t; that has undertaken the Care of the whole Church, and has the ab&s;olute Government of it in his Hands, and the &s;upream Di&s;po&s;al and Management of all eccle&s;ia&s;tical Affairs, to whom belongs the Care of the univer&s;al Church, and e|very Part of it, with Re&s;pect to its Supply with &s;uch Guides, Officers and Ordinances, as it &s;tands in Need of. In Ca&s;e of Bereavement of an eminent Mini&s;ter, it was he that &s;ent forth &s;uch a Mini&s;ter, appointed him his Charge and furni&s;hed him for his Work, continued and a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in it, and in his own Time removed him; and 'tis he that, in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, by his Office has the Care of filling up the Vacancy, and furni&s;hing, e&s;tabli&s;hing and a&s;&s;i&s;ting Succe&s;&s;ors, and &s;upplying all the Wants of bereaved Churches.

<P>I come now to <HI>apply</HI> what has been &s;aid to <HI>the &s;orrow|ful Occa&s;ion</HI> of our being thus a&s;&s;embled at this Time,
<PB N="13" REF="004712_0010_100DC46922658EA8">
even the Death of that aged <HI>Servant of God,</HI> who has long been <HI>eminent</HI> in the Work of the <HI>Go&s;pel-Mini&s;try in this Place.</HI></P>
<P>There are many that may well look on them&s;elves as nearly concerned in this awful Providence, and Sharers in the Bereavement; all of whom &s;hould be directed by this Doctrine, to go and &s;pread their Affliction before <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> that compa&s;&s;ionate, all-&s;ufficient Head of the Church, and Saviour of the Body, that <HI>merciful and faithful High Prie&s;t,</HI> that knows how to pity the afflicted.</P>
<P>And particularly it now becomes and concerns you, that belong to this <HI>Church and Congregation,</HI> that are be|reaved of your aged and <HI>eminent Pa&s;tor</HI> and <HI>Father,</HI> that has &s;o long been a great Ble&s;&s;ing to you, now to <HI>go and tell Je&s;us.</HI></P>
<P>The Di&s;ciples of <HI>John,</HI> &s;poken of in the <HI>Text,</HI> were tho&s;e that were ordinarily under his In&s;truction, and were his con&s;tant Hearers, as it has been with you with Re&s;pect to your <HI>aged Pa&s;tor,</HI> that is now taken from you.

<P>God has now taken away from you an able and <HI>faith|ful Mini&s;ter</HI> of the <HI>New-Te&s;tament,</HI> one that has long been a Father to you, and a <HI>Father in our I&s;rael,</HI> a Per|&s;on of uncommon natural Abilities, and di&s;tingui&s;hed Learning, a great <HI>Divine,</HI> of very comprehen&s;ive Know|ledge, and of a &s;olid accurate Judgment.&mdash;<HI>Judiciou&s;ne&s;s

<P>You know his Manner of addre&s;&s;ing Heaven in his <HI>publick Prayers</HI> with you and for you, with what Sanc|tity, Humility, Faith and Fervency, he &s;eemed to apply him&s;elf to the <HI>Father of Lights,</HI> from Time to Time, when he &s;tood in this <HI>De&s;k</HI> as <HI>your Mouth to God,</HI> and interceeding for you, pleading with God through the Grace and <HI>Merits of a glorious Mediator.</HI> And you know his Manner of <HI>applying him&s;elf to you</HI> when he came to you, from Time to Time, in the Name of the Lord.</P>

<P>And you need not be told with what Weight the <HI>Welfare of your Souls</HI> &s;eemed to lie on his Heart, and how he <HI>in&s;tructed,</HI> and <HI>reproved, and warned, and exhorted you, with all Authority,</HI> and with a fatherly tender Concern for your eternal Good. &mdash; And with what Wi&s;dom he <HI>pre&s;ided</HI> in the <HI>Hou&s;e of God,</HI> and guided its Affairs; and al&s;o <HI>coun&s;el'd</HI> and <HI>directed</HI> you <HI>in private,</HI> under you par|ticular <HI>Soul Exerci&s;es</HI> and Difficulties. You know how he has brought you up, (for mo&s;t of you have been train'd up from <HI>your Childhood under his Mini&s;try,</HI>) with what Authority, and with what <HI>Judgment, Prudence</HI> and Steadine&s;s, he has conducted you as well as <HI>Meek|ne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Gentlene&s;s.</HI> You know his Manner of going in and out among you, how <HI>exemplary</HI> his Walk and Con|ver&s;ation has been, with what Gravity, Judgment and Savour of Holine&s;s, he has walked before you, as <HI>a Man of God.</HI></P>
<P>You have enjoyed great Advantages for your Souls Good, under his Mini&s;try: That you had &s;uch a Mi|ni&s;ter was your Privilege and your Honour; he has been an <HI>Ornament to the Town</HI> of <HI>Hatfield</HI>; and his Pre&s;ence and Conver&s;ation among&s;t you has been both profitable and plea&s;ant; for though it was &s;uch as did peculiarly command <HI>Awe and Re&s;pect,</HI> yet it was at the &s;ame Time, <HI>humble and conde&s;cending</HI>: It tended both to in|&s;truct and entertain tho&s;e that he conver&s;ed with: As a wi&s;e Man, and endued with Knowledge, He <HI>&s;hew|ed
<PB N="16" REF="004712_0013_100DC4713280A660">
out of a good Conver&s;ation his Works with Meekne&s;s of Wi&s;dom.</HI></P>
<P>But now it hath plea&s;ed an holy God to take him away from you: You'l <HI>&s;ee his Face</HI> and hear his Voice <HI>no more,</HI> in the Land of the Living: You'l no more have the Comfort and Benefits of his Pre&s;ence with you, and the Exerci&s;e of his Mini&s;try among you.</P>
<P>Therefore now <HI>go to Je&s;us,</HI> the &s;upream Head of the Church, and <HI>Bi&s;hop of Souls.</HI> Your Pa&s;tor is dead, and will not live again till the la&s;t Day: But Chri&s;t the <HI>chief Shepherd,</HI> though <HI>he was dead, is</HI> now <HI>alive! and behold he lives for evermore. He ever lives</HI> to provide for his Church and to guide and feed his Flock. Go to that Je&s;us whom your decea&s;ed Pa&s;tor preached, and to whom he earne&s;tly invited you while he lived, and give <HI>Thanks</HI> for the many Ble&s;&s;ings you enjoy'd in him. Re|member how you have <HI>receiv'd and heard, &amp; hold fa&s;t,</HI> that no Man take your Crown <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Particularly, Remember his late affectionate Fare|well at the <HI>Table of the Lord,</HI> not expecting &s;uch another Opportunity with you.

&s;o long a Time continued to exhort you, and earne&s;tly prayed for you, while he lived, <HI>ri&s;ing up in Judgment,</HI> and bearing Te&s;timony again&s;t you, declaring how con&s;tantly and laboriou&s;ly he intreated and called upon you, and how ob&s;tinately &s;ome of you &s;lighted his Coun&s;els; and lea&s;t you &s;ee him <HI>&s;itting with Chri&s;t</HI> to judge and con|demn you, and <HI>adoring his awful Ju&s;tice</HI> on your aggra|vated Puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>All you that have an Intere&s;t in JESUS, now go to him on this Occa&s;ion, and <HI>tell him of your Bereavement,</HI> and <HI>beg</HI> of him that he <HI>would not depart from you</HI>; but that he would make up his Lo&s;s in his own <HI>immediate Pre&s;ence.</HI> Go to him for your <HI>&s;urviving Pa&s;tor,</HI> that he would be with him, and furni&s;h him more and more for, and a&s;&s;i&s;t him in that <HI>great Work,</HI> that is now <HI>wholly</HI> de|volved upon him, and make him al&s;o a <HI>burning and &s;hin|ing Light</HI> among&s;t you; and that you may have of the Pre&s;ence and Ble&s;&s;ing of JESUS with you, and him.</P>
<P>And now, Since I am called to &s;peak in the Name of Chri&s;t on this &s;olemn Occa&s;ion, I would apply my &s;elf to the <HI>near Relations</HI> of the Decea&s;ed, who are e&s;pecially to be looked upon, as the <HI>bereaved.</HI></P>
<P>God in his holy Providence has taken from you one that has been a great <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing, Comfort and Honour</HI> to you, and de&s;ervedly very <HI>dear to you,</HI> and <HI>honoured</HI> of you. The Doctrine we are upon directs you what to do in your pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances, <HI>viz.</HI> To <HI>go to Je&s;us,</HI> to go and &s;pread your Affliction before an all-&s;ufficient Redeemer.</P>
<P>And particularly I would apply my &s;elf to the <HI>honour|ed Relict,</HI> who &s;tood in the neare&s;t Relation of any to the Decea&s;ed, whom God by this awful Providence has made a <HI>&s;orrowful Widow.</HI> Suffer me, <HI>honoured Madam,</HI> in your

great Affliction to exhibit to you a <HI>compa&s;&s;ionate Redee|mer.</HI> God has now taken from you that Servant of his, that was the <HI>neare&s;t and be&s;t Friend</HI> you had in this World, that was your wi&s;e and prudent Guide, your af|fectionate and plea&s;ant Companion, who was &s;o great a Ble&s;&s;ing while he lived, to you and your Family, and <HI>under Chri&s;t,</HI> was &s;o much the Comfort and Support of your Life. You &s;ee, <HI>Madam,</HI> where your Re&s;ort mu&s;t be: Your earthly Friends can condole your Lo&s;s, but can't make it up to you; we mu&s;t all confe&s;s our|&s;elves to be but <HI>mi&s;erable Comforters</HI>: But you may <HI>go and tell Je&s;us,</HI> and there you may have both <HI>Support and Reparation:</HI> His Love and his Pre&s;ence is far beyond that of the neare&s;t and mo&s;t affectionate earthly Friend. Now you are bereaved of your earthly Con&s;ort, you may go to a <HI>&s;piritual Hu&s;band,</HI> and &s;eek his Compa&s;&s;ion and his Company; He is the Fountain of all that Wi&s;|dom and Prudence, that Piety, that tender Affection and faithful Care, that you enjoyed in your departed Con&s;ort; in him is an <HI>infinite Fountain</HI> of all the&s;e Things, and of all good; in him you may have <HI>Light in your Darkne&s;s,</HI> Comfort in your Sorrow, and Fulne&s;s of Joy and Glory in another World, in an everla&s;ting Union with your dear <HI>decea&s;ed Relative,</HI> in the glorious Pre&s;ence of the &s;ame <HI>Redeemer,</HI> in <HI>who&s;e Pre&s;ence is Fulne&s;s of Joy, and at who&s;e right Hand are Plea&s;ures for evermore.</HI></P>
<P>This Doctrine al&s;o directs the bereaved <HI>afflicted Chil|dren,</HI> that are with Hearts full of Grief, now mourning over a dear <HI>departed Father,</HI> where to go, and what to do. You will no longer have your Father's <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> to guide you, his <HI>tender Love</HI> to comfort and delight you, and his affectionate Care to guard you and a&s;&s;i&s;t you, and his <HI>pious and judicious Coun&s;els</HI> to direct you, and his <HI>holy Examples</HI> &s;et before you, and his fervent, humble, believing <HI>Prayers</HI> with you and for you.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="004712_0016_100DC4771C4142D8">But in the ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> your Father's Lord and Re|deemer, you may have much more, than all tho&s;e Things: Your Father's Vertues that made him &s;o <HI>great a Ble&s;&s;ing</HI> to you, were but the <HI>Image of</HI> what is in CHRIST.</P>
<P>Therefore go to him in your <HI>Mourning</HI>: Go and tell Je&s;us; tell a compa&s;&s;ionate Saviour what has befallen you. Heretofore you have had an earthly Father to go to, who&s;e <HI>Heart</HI> was full of <HI>Tenderne&s;s</HI> to you; but the <HI>Heart</HI> of his <HI>Redeemer</HI> is much more <HI>tender</HI>; his Wi&s;|dom and his Love is infinitely beyond that of any earthly Parent. Go to him, and then you will &s;urely find Comfort. Go to him and you'l find that, though you are bereaved, yet you are not left in any Want, you'l find that all your Wants are &s;upplied, and all your Lo&s;s made up, and much more than &s;o.</P>
<P>But here I would particularly, in Humility addre&s;s my &s;elf, to my honoured Fathers, the <HI>Sons of the Decea&s;ed,</HI> that are improved in the &s;ame great Work of the <HI>Go&s;pel Mini&s;try,</HI> or in other <HI>publick Bu&s;ine&s;s</HI> for the Service of their Generation. &mdash; Honoured Sirs, Though it might be more proper for me to come to you for In|&s;truction and Coun&s;el, than to take it upon me to <HI>ex|hort you,</HI> yet as I am one that ought to have a Fellow-feeling of your Affliction, and to look on my &s;elf as a <HI>Sharer</HI> in it, and as you have <HI>de&s;ired me</HI> to &s;peak in the Name of Chri&s;t, on this Occa&s;ion, &s;uffer me to mention to you that Source of Comfort, that infinite <HI>Fountain of Good,</HI> one of the larger Streams of which, has failed by the Death of an earthly Father, even the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS. You will doubtle&s;s acknowledge it as an In&s;tance of his great Goodne&s;s to you, that you have been the <HI>Sons</HI> of <HI>&s;uch a Father</HI>; being &s;en&s;ible that your Reputation and Serviceablene&s;s in your Generation, has been, under Chri&s;t, very much owing to the <HI>great Advantages</HI> you

have been under, by his <HI>In&s;tructions, Coun&s;els and Educa|tion.</HI> And it is not fit that Children that have <HI>learned of &s;uch a faithful Servant of Chri&s;t</HI> and been brought up at his Feet now he is dead &s;hould do as <HI>John the Bap|ti&s;t's</HI> Di&s;ciples did, <HI>go and tell Je&s;us</HI>? From whom you may receive Comfort under your Bereavement, and from whom you may receive more of <HI>that Spirit</HI> that <HI>dwelt in him,</HI> and greater Degrees of tho&s;e Vertues he derived from Chri&s;t, to cau&s;e you to &s;hine brighter, and to make you &s;till greater Ble&s;&s;ings in your Generation. Now Death has veiled and hid from Sight, a <HI>Star</HI> that &s;hone with <HI>reflected Light,</HI> our <HI>Text and Doctrine</HI> leads you to the <HI>Sun</HI> that hath <HI>Light in him&s;elf,</HI> and &s;hines with infi|nite unfailing Brightne&s;s. And while you go to Je&s;us, honoured Sirs, on this Occa&s;ion for your &s;elves, I hum|bly de&s;ire your Reque&s;ts to him for us the <HI>&s;urviving Mi|ni&s;ters</HI> of this County, that he would be with us, now he has taken from us him that was as <HI>a Father</HI> among&s;t us.</P>
<P>I nextly would addre&s;s my &s;elf to the <HI>&s;urviving Pa&s;tor</HI> of this Church. We may well look upon you, <HI>Reve|rend Sir,</HI> as one in an e&s;pecial Manner concerned in this <HI>awful Providence,</HI> and that has a large Share in the Bereavement. You doubtle&s;s, are &s;en&s;ible what Rea|&s;on you have to ble&s;s God for the <HI>Advantage</HI> you have had, in &s;erving in the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, &s;o long as you have done, with the <HI>venerable Per&s;on</HI> decea&s;ed, as <HI>a Son with a Father,</HI> enjoying the Benefit of his In&s;tructions, Coun&s;els and Example <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">And particularly, you will often recollect the affecti|onate and fatherly <HI>Coun&s;els</HI> he gave you, to Diligence and Faithfulne&s;s in your <HI>Lord's</HI> Work, with Encou|ragement, of his <HI>Protection and A&s;&s;i&s;tance,</HI> to carry you thro' all <HI>Difficulties</HI>: The la&s;t <HI>Evening of his Life.</HI></NOTE> And now, <HI>dear Sir,</HI> God

You have now a great Work devolved upon you; you have him no more who while he lived was as a <HI>Father</HI> to you, to guide and a&s;&s;i&s;t you, and take the Burthen of your great Work from you.
