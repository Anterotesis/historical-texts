<P>VERY Wonderful and A&s;to|ni&s;hing is the Divine Love and Gra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, in the Redemption of Sinners thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t. This Subject, ju&s;tly calls for our highest Meditation &amp; Admiration: we &s;hould &s;o contemplate on it, as heartily to com|ply with it's Invitations in the Go&s;pel. To move &amp; quicken Sinners here-unto, is what's mainly aim'd at in the following Sermons. I hope every one who &s;eriou&s;ly Reads them, will (by Gods ble&s;&s;ing) be clearly convinc'd, that Chri&s;t is fully able and willing to <HI>Save all Sorts of Sinners,</HI> that will Submit to Him on Go&s;pel Termes. It's the Wi&s;dom and Intere&s;t of all &s;o to Submit, and Inexcu|&s;able folly and wickedne&s;s in any to refu&s;e. I have Indeavour'd to an&s;wer &s;everal Ob|jections, which Sinners are apt to make a|gain&s;t

coming to Chri&s;t: they'll &s;urely be Self-condemn'd if they refu&s;e Him. And how &s;hall any e&s;cape if they neglect &s;o great Salvation! Here are offers of Salvation to <HI>Men</HI> and <HI>Women,</HI> to tho&s;e of <HI>Various Nations,</HI> to <HI>Old</HI> and <HI>Young, High</HI> and <HI>Low, Rich</HI> and <HI>Poor, Bond</HI> and <HI>Free.</HI> I have here treated on &s;undry Subjects, I hope none Unprofitable to a diligent Reader. The Preaching of the&s;e Sermons, I hope was not fruitle&s;s; a number of the Hearers Spee|dily de&s;ired the Printing of them, and readily Sub&s;crib'd to the doing it: I wi&s;h their Souls may be abundantly Profitted, by what they de&s;ir'd &s;hould be thus made Publick, the &s;ame I wi&s;h to the Souls of all that Heard them or may Read them. 'Tis my earne&s;t de&s;ire, that my Poor Indeavours may be In|&s;trumental to promote the Glory of Chri&s;t, and the goods of Souls; that the&s;e Ser|mons, and whatever el&s;e I have Printed, may be &s;o, is what I Pray to God for, and hope I &s;hall do &s;o as long as I Live.</P>

<P>Then &s;aid he unto him, A certain man made a great &s;upper, and bade many:</P>

<P>THESE Words here &s;poken by our Ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer, the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, are the be|ginning of a <HI>Parable.</HI> For we have much the &s;ame Di&s;cour&s;e as to the <HI>Scope</HI> and <HI>Sub&s;tance</HI> of it (tho' differing in &s;un|dry
<PB N="2" REF="001789_0005_0FB82B5062D02BA0">
Particulars) <HI>Mat.</HI> 22.2. <HI>v. &amp;c.</HI> and there 'tis call'd a <HI>Parable. v.</HI> 1. Je&s;us an&s;wered and &s;pake unto them again by <HI>Parables.</HI> The <HI>Para|ble</HI> which our Text is the beginning of, is of a Great <HI>Man</HI> (there call'd <HI>Lord, v.</HI> 21, 22. and <HI>King,</HI> Mat. 22.2.) making a great <HI>Supper,</HI> a great <HI>Feast,</HI> and by his Servants Inviting <HI>many Guests;</HI> the fir&s;t that were Invited made <HI>Ex|cu&s;es</HI> and would not come, <HI>v.</HI> 18. &mdash; 20. Here|upon, that Lord, who&s;e kindne&s;s was thus de&s;|pi&s;ed, was <HI>Angry,</HI> and re&s;olv'd that the de&s;pi&s;ers of his offered kindne&s;s, &s;hould not ta&s;te of his Supper; and &s;o order'd his Servants to go into the <HI>Streets</HI> and <HI>Lanes,</HI> and to Invite others to the Fea&s;t, even the <HI>Poor, Maimed, Halt</HI> and <HI>Blind,</HI> and tho&s;e al&s;o who were in the <HI>High wayes and Hedges,</HI> yea to <HI>Compell</HI> them to come in, that his Hou&s;e might be filled. It's very probably thought, that in this Parable one thing mainly intended by our Saviour was, to &s;et forth the <HI>Rejection of the Jews</HI> for their <HI>refu&s;ing of Go&s;pel Offers &amp; Invitations,</HI> and the <HI>Calling in of the Gentiles.</HI> However, by a Man (a <HI>Lord,</HI> or <HI>King</HI>) here making a Fea&s;t and bidding many to it, we may under&s;tand <HI>God and Christ &s;ending forth Ministers to Invite Sinners to believe in Chri&s;t,</HI> to accept the Benefits Offer'd in the Go&s;pel; many refu&s;e the&s;e Offers, they wont accept the Go&s;pel-Ble&s;&s;ings they're Invited to, &s;uch &s;hall not ta&s;te of the Fea&s;t, they &s;hall peri&s;h for ever. But tho' &s;ome thus refu&s;e Go&s;pel-Offers, God will make them to others, and would have his <HI>Servants,</HI> Mini&s;ters <HI>Compell</HI> them to come in, that is, be <HI>very urgent</HI> with them to accept the Benefits Offer'd in the Go&s;pel. It

&s;eems our Saviour when He &s;pake this Parable about a <HI>Fea&s;t,</HI> was then Him&s;elf <HI>at a Fea&s;t, v.</HI> 1. <HI>He went into the Hou&s;e of one of the chief Phari|&s;ees to eat Bread on the Sabbath-Day.</HI> It's likely this was &s;omething more than an ordinary Meal, even a <HI>con&s;iderable Feast</HI> or Entertainment, where <HI>many Gue&s;ts</HI> were, becau&s;e 'tis &s;aid, <HI>v.</HI> 7. <HI>He marked how they cho&s;e out the chief Rooms;</HI> and thence caution'd them that when they were bidden to a Wedding, not proudly to &s;eek for chief Places. When our Lord was thus <HI>at a Fea&s;t,</HI> He took occa&s;ion to <HI>Spiritualize</HI> the pre|&s;ent Affair, to &s;et forth Spiritual things under the <HI>Notion or Similitude of a Fea&s;t.</HI> So when He had Miraculou&s;ly Fed many with a <HI>few Loaves,</HI> He took occa&s;ion to &s;peak of the <HI>Meat that en|dures to Everla&s;ting Life,</HI> Joh. 6.27. When He ask'd the <HI>Woman of Samaria</HI> for &s;ome <HI>Water</HI> to drink, He took occa&s;ion to &s;peak about <HI>Living-Water &mdash; &s;pringing up unto Everla&s;ting Life,</HI> Joh. 4.10, 14. From our Saviour's Practice herein, we &s;hould be quicken'd to <HI>Spiritualize</HI> the Mat|ters that occur, the Affairs before us; thence taking occa&s;ion to &s;peak tho&s;e things which may be of <HI>Spiritual u&s;e and advantage.</HI> Provi|dence gives us many fair Handles (or Oppor|tunities) for this, if we had but Wi&s;dom and Grace to Improve them. If we were prudent and careful in this matter, we might frequent|ly and ea&s;ily do much Good, without any more Co&s;t or Labour than that of a few Words. Our Text, with the remaining part of the Para|ble, &s;eem to be <HI>Introduc'd</HI> by way of <HI>Reply,</HI> to what was &s;aid by one at Meat with our Savi|our. Our Lord advis'd the Man who gave Him

an Invitation to Eat, when he made an Enter|tainment, to Invite the <HI>Poor</HI> and Indigent who were not likely to Invite him again, nor make him any requital; if with a right Spirit he did thus, he &s;hould be <HI>Recompens'd at the Re&s;ur|rection of the Ju&s;t, v.</HI> 12. &mdash; 14. Hereupon, one that &s;at at Meat and heard the&s;e things, &s;aid, <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed is he that &s;hall eat Bread in the Kingdom of God.</HI> To this &s;aying, our Text is &s;ubjoined and annexed, <HI>Then &s;aid he unto him,</HI> that is, then &s;pake Chri&s;t to him that had uttered tho&s;e words (tho' in the hearing al&s;o of the re&s;t) <HI>A certain Man made a great Supper, and bade many,</HI> &amp;c. This Great <HI>Man Inviting many to a great Supper</HI> (or &s;umptuous Fea&s;t) may &s;ignifie (as was hinted before) <HI>God's Inviting Sinners</HI> to ac|cept Spiritual, Saving Benefits Offered to them in the Go&s;pel. From the Words therefore we may ob&s;erve this,</P>

<HEAD><HI>DOCTRINE.</HI> GOD'S Inviting Sinners to accept of Spiritual, Saving Benefits Offered in the Go&s;pel; may be compared to a great Man's Inviting many Per|&s;ons to a Sumptuous Feast.</HEAD>
<P>Here I &s;hall indeavour to &s;et forth &s;ome Pa|rallel, or &s;hew in &s;ome General Heads; where|in God's Offering Spiritual Saving Benefits to Sinners in the Go&s;pel, may be compar'd to a great Man's Inviting many to a Sumptuous Fea&s;t.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Various Sorts of Per&s;ons, are commonly Invited to a Great and Sumptuous Feast.</HI> To &s;uch a Fea&s;t,
<PB N="5" REF="001789_0008_0FB82B58F217E9E0">
it's common to Invite Per&s;ons of each Sex, <HI>Men</HI> and <HI>Women:</HI> Per&s;ons of different Age, &s;ome <HI>Younger</HI> &s;ome <HI>Older</HI> ones: Per&s;ons of diffe|rent Rank or Quality, &s;ome of an <HI>Higher</HI> and &s;ome of a <HI>Lower</HI> Station. So where the Go&s;pel is Preached, God Offers Spiritual Saving Be|nefits to various Sorts of Per&s;ons, even to all Sorts be they who they will that &s;it under &s;uch Preaching: none are exempted or excluded. Col. 3.11. <HI>There is neither Greek nor Jew, Bar|barian, Scythian, Bond or Free, but Christ is all and in all.</HI> Gal. 3.28. <HI>Three is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither Bond nor Free, there is neither Male nor Female: for ye are all one in Christ Je&s;us.</HI> All the&s;e <HI>various Sorts of Per&s;ons</HI> are equally welcome to Chri&s;t, &s;hall be equally Benefitted by Him as to all Saving Ble&s;&s;ings; if they'l heartily accept of Him as Offered in the Go&s;|pel. I may therefore &s;ay, that Spiritual Saving Benefits are Offered to <HI>all Sorts of Per&s;ons,</HI> where the Go&s;pel is plainly and Faithfully Preached. And to mention &s;ome particular Heads, I may &s;ay, &s;uch Benefits are offered,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Both to Men and Women.</HI> There's no diffe|rence between <HI>Male and Female,</HI> as to this mat|ter: both, as proceeding from Fallen Apo&s;tate <HI>Adam,</HI> are <HI>&s;hapen in Iniquity and conceiv'd in Sin; a Seed of Evil doers, Children of Wrath by Nature.</HI> They're by Nature equally Sinful and Guilty, Heirs of Wrath, Obnoxious to Hell and Damnation. They <HI>equally need</HI> Chri&s;t, that on|ly Saviour of Sinners; and he Dy'd to Save tho&s;e of each Sex. Act. 5.14. <HI>And of Belie|vers were the more added to the Lord, Multitudes both of Men and Women.</HI> Both <HI>Men and Women
<PB N="6" REF="001789_0009_0FB82B5A7A7DD8B0">
Believed</HI> and were <HI>Baptized,</HI> Act. 8.12. Tho&s;e of each Sex, &s;hall be <HI>equally welcome to Chri&s;t,</HI> if they'l come. Joh. 3.16. <HI>Who&s;oever believeth in him, &s;hall not peri&s;h but have Everla&s;ting Life.</HI> Tho' according to the different U&s;ages and Cu&s;toms of different Nations and Countreys, <HI>Men</HI> and <HI>Women</HI> are not equally capable of like Digni|ties and Priviledges among Men; yet as to <HI>better</HI> Dignities and Priviledges than any which Men can confer, even tho&s;e that are <HI>Spiritual and Saving,</HI> there's no difference between them. <HI>Male and Female,</HI> one as well as the other are equally Invited to accept of Chri&s;t and Salva|tion thro' Him, and if they'l accept them on Go&s;pel Terms they &s;hall be equally welcome to them.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>To Per&s;ons of various Nations.</HI> The <HI>I&s;raeli|ti&s;h Nation</HI> were once God's <HI>peculiar People,</HI> di&s;tingui&s;h'd by having the Divine Oracles com|mitted to them, while God dealt not &s;o with every Nation. P&s;al. 147.19, 20. with Rom. 3.2. <HI>The Common Wealth of I&s;rael had the Cove|nants of Promi&s;e,</HI> while others had not, <HI>Eph.</HI> 2.12. They had the Way of Life thro' the Promi&s;ed <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> made known to them, <HI>Salvation is of the Jews,</HI> Joh. 4.22. Thus they were Priviledg'd with the&s;e Revelations of God's Will, while o|ther Nations (generally &s;peaking) knew but little or almo&s;t nothing of the&s;e things. And hence we find, <HI>all Mankind</HI> &s;ometimes di&s;tin|gui&s;h'd or di&s;tributed into <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles.</HI> Rom. 3.29. <HI>Is he the God of the Jews only? Is he not al&s;o of the Gentiles? Yea of the Gentiles al&s;o.</HI> But now, that di&s;tinction which there once was between <HI>Jew and Gentile,</HI> as to the Covenant
<PB N="7" REF="001789_0010_0FB82B5BA66CAF68">
Priviledges, or nearne&s;s to God, is removed; <HI>The middle wall of Partition is broken down,</HI> Eph. 2.14. If an <HI>I&s;raelite,</HI> and <HI>one of another Nation,</HI> heartily receive Chri&s;t; they &s;hall be equally welcome to Him and Benefitted by Him. In this ca&s;e, there's no difference between Jew and Gentile; for <HI>all have Sinned and come &s;hort of the Glory of God &mdash; It is one God which &s;hall Ju&s;tifie the Circum&s;icion by Faith, and the Uncircum&s;ion thro' Faith,</HI> Rom. 3.22, 23, 30. Tho' while our Sa|viour dwelt in Fle&s;h here on Earth, He <HI>Limi|ted</HI> the Commi&s;&s;ion of His <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> as to their <HI>Preaching,</HI> Mat. 10.5, 6. <HI>Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any City of the Samaritanes enter ye not; but go rather to the lo&s;t Sheep of the hou&s;e of I&s;rael;</HI> Yet after His Re&s;urrection from the Dead, He Inlarg'd their Commi&s;&s;ion &s;aying, Mat. 28.19. <HI>Go teach</HI> (or <HI>Di&s;ciple,</HI> as the word &s;ignifies) <HI>all Nations Baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> &amp;c. Chri&s;t has broken down (as was hinted before) the Wall of Partition between Jews and Gentiles. He's a <HI>Light to the Gentiles,</HI> as well as the <HI>Glory of his people I&s;rael.</HI> Luk. 2.32. Wherever the Go&s;pel comes, he now <HI>Commands all men every where to repent,</HI> Act. 17.30. And indeed, <HI>In every Nation he that fears God and worketh righteou&s;ne&s;s, is accepted with him,</HI> Act. 10.35. Therefore let Per&s;ons be of what Na|tion &s;oever, of what <HI>Colour</HI> &s;oever, whether <HI>White</HI> or <HI>Black;</HI> yet where the Go&s;pel comes, it Invites them <HI>all</HI> to accept of Chri&s;t and Sal|vation thro' Him. <HI>Indians, Negroes,</HI> the <HI>blacke&s;t Ethiopians</HI> as well as any others, are equally welcome to Chri&s;t if they'l accept Him on Go&s;|pel
<PB N="8" REF="001789_0011_0FB82B5D1E586EC0">
termes. None &s;hall be Pardoned on Earth or made happy in Heaven, meerly for their be|ing of this or that Nation, of this or that co|lour <HI>White</HI> or <HI>Black;</HI> nor &s;hall any be rejected on any &s;uch accounts as the&s;e, Per&s;ons of all Nations what&s;over, equally need Saving be|nefits by Chri&s;t; and &s;hall be equally well|come to them and ve&s;ted in them, if they will accept them as offer'd in the Go&s;pel. Again, Saving benefits are offered,</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Both to Per&s;ons Old and Young.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Old Sinners need a Saviour.</HI> And not|with&s;tanding they have liv'd long in Wicked|ne&s;s, yet if they'll heartily Submit to Chri&s;t they &s;hall be Saved. God extends His Pati|ence and Forbearance to &s;ome Sinners, a <HI>ve|ry great while</HI> indeed: They're Suffer'd to live <HI>Long</HI> tho' they live <HI>Wickedly. Wherefore do the Wicked live, become Old?</HI> &amp;c. Job. 21.7. <HI>Tho' a Sinner do evil an hundred times, and his Days be prolonged,</HI> &amp;c. Eccl. 8.12, 13. A Per|&s;on's living to be <HI>Old,</HI> is no &s;ure Sign that God is at Peace with him. I&s;ai. 65.20. &mdash; <HI>The Sinner being an hundred Years Old &s;hall be Accur|&s;ed.</HI> If Per&s;ons are never &s;o <HI>Old,</HI> yet if <HI>Unbe|lieving;</HI> then the <HI>Wrath of God abideth on them,</HI> Joh. 3.36. Yet if even &s;uch <HI>Old Sinners,</HI> who have &s;pent their <HI>Youth, Health, Strength,</HI> all their many pa&s;t Years in the Service of Sin and Satan, Provoking of God and Injuring of their own Souls; I &s;ay, if &s;uch will Sincerely Re|pent of Sin and Accept of Chri&s;t as Offer'd in the Go&s;pel, they &s;ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l certainly be Pardon'd and Sav'd for ever. It's a <HI>Faithful Saying wor|thy
<PB N="9" REF="001789_0012_0FB82B5EB1B12160">
of all Acception, that Chri&s;t came to &s;ave Sin|ners,</HI> even the <HI>Chief</HI> of them, 1 Tim. 1.15. Chri&s;t is <HI>able to Save to the Uttermo&s;t</HI> tho&s;e that come to God by Him, Heb. 7.25. But is he <HI>Willing</HI> too? Yes Indeed, for He &s;ays, Joh. 6.37. <HI>Him that cometh unto me, I will in no wi&s;e cast out.</HI> Here's wondrous Grace indeed, that even the Wor&s;t, Olde&s;t, Vile&s;t Sinners, the Chief of them, if they'll Heartily come to Chri&s;t &s;hall be Freely and Fully Saved by Him. If then there be any <HI>Old Unconverted Sinners</HI> in this Congregation, that have &s;pent all their pa&s;t time in Neglect and Contempt of God; if there be any &s;uch here, hearken to what I &s;ay, <HI>Full, Compleat Salvation thro' Je&s;us Christ is now once more Freely Offered to you.</HI> If you <HI>Old Sinners,</HI> Great Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, who have &s;o long De&s;pis'd the Riches of God's Goodne&s;s, Forbearance, and Long-Suffering; will now once at la&s;t Sin|cerely Turn from your Sins to God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, you &s;hall then be Welcome to Chri&s;t, and be Saved by Him for ever. Oh, Admire at this Amazing Grace and Patience of God! Accept the Invitation, Defer no longer. Your Time on Earth can't be long, your Days mu&s;t needs be near their End; you'll have but very few if any more Offers of the Go&s;|pel, your Old Age will &s;oon be ended. Therefore <HI>to Day, after &s;o long a Time as it is &s;aid to Day, if ye will hear his Voice, harden not your Hearts,</HI> Heb. 4.7. You that are <HI>Old Sin|ners,</HI> pray Con&s;ider the&s;e Things, they are for your Life, for the Life of your Souls: There|fore mind them mo&s;t Seriou&s;ly, before the Things of your Peace be Eternally hidden
<PB N="10" REF="001789_0013_0FB82B61382E4360">
from your Eyes. And as Spiritual Saving Benefits are thus Offered to <HI>Old Sinners,</HI> &s;o they are,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>To Young Sinners al&s;o. Young</HI> as well as <HI>Old</HI> Sinners need a Chri&s;t, are Invited to Him, and <HI>&s;hould</HI> come to Him. According to the Laws and Cu&s;toms of &s;ome Places, Per&s;ons mu&s;t be of &s;uch or &s;uch an Age, &s;o Old, be|fore they can Claim the&s;e or tho&s;e Privi|leges; or in their own Per&s;ons Enter on and Po&s;&s;e&s;s their E&s;tates. Gal. 4.1, 2. <HI>The Heir, as long as he is a Child, differeth nothing from a Servant, tho' he be Lord of all: but is under Tutors &amp; Governours, until the Time appointed of the Father.</HI> But now, as to the be&s;t and greate&s;t Privi|ledges and Benefits, even Saving Benefits; Per|&s;ons as &s;oon as capable of making a Rational Deliberate Choice (tho' never &s;o Young) are Invited to Accept of them. <HI>Young Per&s;ons,</HI> yea <HI>Children</HI> are call'd upon to Believe in Chri&s;t, Fear God, Walk in the one only Way that leads to Life.

him, and delivereth them,</HI> P&s;al. 34.7. Number|le&s;s are the benefits, which the holy Angels by an Invi&s;ible Efficacy are In&s;trumental of to the Saints. This is an honour and favour to the Saints, that God Employs the Courtiers on Hea|ven who &s;urround His glorious Throne, to pro|mote their good and wellfare. Indeed &s;uch are the benefits belonging to the Saints, and a&s;&s;ur'd to them by the true and faithful Promi&s;es of God; that there's &s;ufficient ground for that Precept, Phil. 4.4. <HI>Rejoyce in the Lord always, and again I &s;ay Rejoyce.</HI> It's marter of comfort to the Saints:</P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>That great happine&s;s is re&s;erved for them in the future World.</HI> Whatever they meet with on Earth whether of Health or Sickne&s;s, Ea&s;e or Pain, Honour or Contempt, Riches or Poverty, however tis with them as to the&s;e things while they're Pilgrims in the World, yet at and after Death great ble&s;&s;edne&s;s will be their Portion.

<P N="1">1. <HI>At their Death.</HI> When their <HI>Souls are ab|&s;ent from their Bodies, they go to be pre&s;ent with the Lord:</HI> They go to be <HI>with Christ, which is far better</HI> than being here; and therefore <HI>for them to die is gain,</HI> 2 Cor. 5.8.

Men can do to them is, to <HI>Kill their Bodies,</HI> Mar. 10.28. Men can't hurt them after this, after the Body is dead; for then their Souls will be out of Mens reach, and if never &s;o great Indignities are offered to their dead bodies, they'll not be &s;en&s;ible of any Pain or hurt thereby, but will be &s;afely re&s;erv'd to a glo|gious Re&s;urrection. When the Saints are de|parted; then <HI>the Wicked cea&s;e to trouble them, and the weary are at re&s;t,</HI> Job 3.17. The Saints when dead, are not capable of being afflicted by Pain, Sickne&s;s, Contempt, Reproach, Per|&s;ecution, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> nor by &s;eeing or hearing the a|bominations committed by the Children of Men. All their Tears and Sorrows are ended for ever.

<P N="2">2. <HI>They are freed from all the Temptations of Satan.</HI> Satan's Temptations are often Un&s;peak|ably Vexatious and Perplexing to the Saints while here on Earth: Oh the cur&s;ed helli&s;h Sugge&s;tions, the fiery darts he often &s;hoots in|to them! But when the Saints die, their Souls are out of the reach of the&s;e fiery darts; they go to be with Chri&s;t, and Satan's Temptations can never reach nor a&s;&s;ault them there. Satan is Emphatically called <HI>the Wicked One,</HI> Eph. 6.16. But when the Saints <HI>die,</HI> the <HI>Wicked</HI> (it may comprehend <HI>Devils</HI> as well as Men) &s;hall <HI>cea&s;e troubling</HI> them, as in the fore-cited, <HI>Job</HI> 3.17.

There's no &s;uch thing as perfect Sinle&s;s Purity and Holine&s;s, to be obtain'd here in this World. <HI>There is not a Ju&s;t man upon Earth, that doth good and Sinneth not,</HI> Eccl. 7.20. <HI>If we &s;ay we have no Sin, we deceive our &s;elves and the truth is not in us,</HI> 1 Joh. 1.8.

This remaining &s;in in them, draws back and &s;trives to hinder them from every duty, it inclines and prompts to all manner of Wickedne&s;s. It <HI>Lu&s;ts again&s;t the Spirit, is contrary to it, &s;o that the Saints cannot do the things which they would,</HI> Gal. 5.17. When they would do good, evil is pre&s;ent with them. Very often, the good which they would they do not, and the evil which they would not that they do: they find a law in their Members warring again&s;t the law in their Minds, and bringing them into Captivity to the law of &s;in that is in their Members. This is unutterably grievous and perplexing to them, it often makes them cry out as he, Rom. 7.24.

Of the <HI>Lord's-Supper</HI> He &s;aid, Luk. 22.19. <HI>This do in Remem|brance of Me.</HI> And the&s;e Ordinances are to con|tinue to the End of the World, as Means to further the Salvation of <HI>Sinners.</HI> And though the&s;e Means Appointed by Infinite Wi&s;dom and Love, are Imployed and Applyed after the be&s;t Manner that can be; yet no &s;aving Good can be wrought by them, unle&s;s the <HI>Spirit</HI> of Chri&s;t &s;ets in to do it. 2 Cor. 10.4. <HI>The weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but migh|ty through God, to the pulling down of &s;trong Holds, ca&s;ting down Imaginations, and every High Thing that exalts it &s;elf again&s;t the Knowledge of God,

and bringing into Captivity every thought to the Obedince of Chri&s;t.</HI> Tho&s;e that are Converted, they have the <HI>wa&s;hing of Regeneration, and the Renewing of the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> Tit. 3.5. Tis the <HI>exceeding greatne&s;s of Gods power, according to the working of his mighty power,</HI> that begets <HI>Faith</HI> in any Soul, <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.19.

<P>Thus there has been (and is) <HI>Co&s;t and Charge</HI> (if we may &s;o term it) on the part of God, of Chri&s;t, to <HI>Provide</HI> and apply that great Salva|tion, that glorious endle&s;s ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, which Sinners in the Go&s;pel are Invited to accept of. It's often matter of great co&s;t and charge to tho&s;e, who make a Sumptuous Fea&s;t and Invite many to it; but never was any at &s;uch <HI>Co&s;t</HI> for a Fea&s;t, as Chri&s;t has been at to purcha&s;e the Salvation Sinners are Invited to: this Sal|vation co&s;t him His own mo&s;t precious Blood for the purcha&s;ing of it. <HI>Ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as &s;ilver and gold &mdash; but with the precious blood of Chri&s;t, as of a Lamb without blemi&s;h and without &s;pot,</HI> 1 Pet. 1.18, 19. We may now proceed to another general head of Compari&s;on, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>What Per&s;ons are Invited to at a Fea&s;t, is at free cost as to them.</HI> Tho' its commonly mat|ter of co&s;t and charge to him that makes the Entertainment, yet it co&s;ts nothing to the Gue&s;ts them&s;elves; its kindne&s;s freely granted

to them. Its given them, given freely, what they're Invited to eat and drink co&s;ts them no|thing, they pay nothing for it. The Inviter has a Mind to &s;how his Love, Kindne&s;s, Boun|ty, in freely communicating his good things to tho&s;e whom he Invites. So the &s;aving bene|fits offer'd to Sinners in the Go&s;pel, are offer'd <HI>freely.</HI> Whatever co&s;t or charge there may have been, on the part of God or Chri&s;t, to provide or procure the&s;e &s;aving benefits; yet there's no co&s;t or charge on the part of Sinners that are Invited to receive them. Sinners <HI>as &s;uch</HI> are worthy of Death, Children of Wrath, de&s;erve Hell and everla&s;ting Vengeance: this is all they're worthy of at God's hand. They are utterly and altogether unworthy of all that &s;aving Mercy, that's offer'd to them in the Go&s;|pel. Therefore tho' they're bid to <HI>buy tryed gold, and white raiment,</HI> Rev. 3.18. Yet they're bid|den <HI>to buy without money and without price,</HI> I&s;ai. 55.1. That is, they're Invited to accept Spi|ritual Saving ble&s;&s;ings, <HI>mo&s;t freely offer'd</HI> to them. Tho' they have no price, no money to lay down; that is, no Merits, Worthine&s;s, Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s of their own, nothing of their own to recommend them to Divine favour, yet they're Invited to accept full compleat Salvation <HI>freely</HI> offered to them. The <HI>gift of God</HI> is eternal Life, <HI>Rom.</HI> 6.23. Tis your Father's <HI>good plea|&s;ure to give you the Kingdom,</HI> Luk. 12.32. Who|ever obtains Salvation, Eternal Life, will ob|tain it by way of <HI>free gift as from God,</HI> from Chri&s;t; and what can be <HI>freer than a gift?</HI> Nothing can be <HI>more freely offered,</HI> than Salvation is to Sinners in the Go&s;pel. Here we may con&s;ider:</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="71" REF="001789_0074_0FB82BD8C19CDF50">1. <HI>GOD needs not the Salvation of Sinners.</HI> Men will &s;ometimes Ingage in great, co&s;tly, difficult affairs; when they think their own real welfare calls for it: very often <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> will make them venture <HI>hard.</HI> But God had no nece&s;&s;ity at all, to <HI>concern</HI> Him&s;elf about the Salvation of Sinners. God's Compleat E&s;&s;en|tial Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, is Unchangible. With Him there <HI>is no variablene&s;s nor &s;hadow of turning,</HI> Jam. 1.17. God's happine&s;s can't be dimini&s;h'd by Mens Wickedne&s;s or Mi&s;ery, nor be increas'd by their Holine&s;s or Felicity. Job 35.6, 7. <HI>If thou &s;inne&s;t, what doe&s;t thou again&s;t Him? Or if thy Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions be multiplied, what doe&s;t thou unto Him? If thou be righteous, what give&s;t thou Him? Or what receiveth He of thine hand?</HI> If all Men had peri&s;hed Eternally for their Wickedne&s;s, as all the fallen Angels &s;hall; God's E&s;&s;ential Compleat Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s would not have been at all impaired thereby.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>From all Eternity, God of His own heart con|triv'd the Scheme and Method of Sinners Salvation.</HI> Tis His <HI>Eternal Purpo&s;e,</HI> Eph. 3.11. Men could not be <HI>first movers</HI> in this Scheme, twas laid long before they had any being. The Motion there|fore was intirely, wholly, only from God, of His own heart, of His own meer good Will and Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Twas of meer Love, that God gave Chri&s;t to Save Sinners.</HI> Joh. 3.16. <HI>God &s;o loved the World, as to give His only Begotten Son, that who&s;oever Believeth in Him, &s;hould not peri&s;h but have Ever|lasting Life.</HI> Twas meer Love, Grace, Bounty, Good Will in the Heart of God towards Sin|ners (and not any need of them, or fore&s;een

worthine&s;s in them) that put Him on &s;ending His Son on this Errand.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Twas of meer Love, that Chri&s;t Died for Sin|ners.</HI> In them&s;elves con&s;ider'd they were Rebels, Traytors, Enemies, Children of the Devil, Heirs of Hell; yet from a free Love to, and De&s;ire of, their Salvation, Chri&s;t Dyed for them. <HI>He loved us, and gave him&s;elf for us an Offering and a Sacrifice to God,</HI> Eph. 5.2. Rev. 1.5. So that this great Salvation Offer'd in the Go&s;pel, is the mo&s;t Gratuitous and Free that can be, with re&s;pect to tho&s;e to whom tis Offer'd. There's no worthine&s;s, merit, or good de&s;erving re|quir'd in Sinners, in order to their accepting of it. Indeed both from the Nature of the thing, and from the Divine Con&s;titution, it's nece&s;&s;ary that they &s;hould be Sick of their Sins, Weary and heavy Laden with them, &s;ee their peri&s;hing undone Condition, their <HI>need of Christ</HI> in order to their obtaining Salvation by Him. But if they &s;ee, confe&s;s, bewail their own Sinful&punc; Guilty, Peri&s;hing Undone Condition; and &s;o &s;ee their <HI>need of Chri&s;t;</HI> they may then come empty-handed, in their Naked Forlorn &s;tate to Chri&s;t for the healing and &s;aving of their Souls, and they &s;hall be <HI>welcome</HI> to Him. Who&s;oever is athir&s;t let him come, let him take the Water of Life <HI>freely,</HI> Rev. 22.17 <HI>If any Man thir&s;t</HI> (be he who he will,) <HI>let him come unto me</HI> (&s;ays Chri&s;t) <HI>and drink,</HI> Joh. 7.37.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="question">
<HEAD><HI>Que&s;t.</HI> Whence is it, that all Men are naturally backward and unwilling to Accept of Go&s;pel Offers and Invitations?</HEAD>
<P>An&s;w. 1. <HI>It proceeds from the depravation and corruption of their Natures, from the prevalency of Sin in them.</HI> Our Lord Redeemer is call'd <HI>Je|&s;us,</HI> becau&s;e he <HI>Saves</HI> his People <HI>from their Sins,</HI> Mat. 1.21. He was &s;ent on this great errand, to <HI>Ble&s;s</HI> Men in <HI>turning them from</HI> their Iniqui|ties, <HI>Act.</HI> 3.26. Therefore when Per&s;ons are call'd upon to accept of Chri&s;t and Salvation with him; they're Indeed requir'd, not only to tru&s;t in his Meritorious Righteou&s;ne&s;s for Ju&s;tification before God, but al&s;o to deny them|&s;elves, take up their Cro&s;s and follow Chri&s;t whether&s;oever he goes. They're requir'd to conform to Gods Preceptive Will, as the only unalterable Rule and Mea&s;ure of all their Thoughts, Words and Deeds. They're re|quir'd, to yield up them&s;elves Intirely, Uni|ver&s;ally, Continually, and without re&s;erve to God, to Chri&s;t, to be for Him and for none other; to make his Word their Rule and his Glory their end in all they do. Now nothing can be more contrary than this is, to the de|praved, corrupted Nature of fallen Man. <HI>Adam</HI>

More particularly, this backwardne&s;s and un|willingne&s;s in Men, to accept of Go&s;pel Invi|tations, does proceed:</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>From their Blindne&s;s and Ignorance.</HI> All the faculties of the Rational Soul, are wonderfully deprav'd &amp; vitiated by Sin. The Under&s;tand|ing is wonderfully weaken'd, darkned, blinded. The Holy Gho&s;t in de&s;cribing the depravation of fallen Men, &s;ays, Rom. 3.11, 17. <HI>There is none that Under&s;tandeth, there is none that Seeketh after God &mdash; the way of Peace have they not known.</HI> And &s;o Unregenerate men are &s;aid to be <HI>in darkne&s;s;</HI> and Conver&s;ion is call'd an <HI>Opening of their Eyes, a turning them from darkne&s;s to light: a calling them out of darkne&s;s into marvellous light,</HI> Act. 26.18. 1 Pet. 2.9. Unregenerate Per&s;ons are &s;o in the dark, that they have not a right view and under&s;tanding of things: they have not a right view and &s;en&s;e of the cur&s;ed nature and tendency of Sin, of their own Slavery to it, and liablene&s;s to mi&s;ery for it. They dont rightly &s;ee and con&s;ider their own danger and hazard, the Suitablene&s;s and All-&s;ufficiency of Chri&s;t to Save them, their ab&s;olute need of an Intere&s;t in Him by heart-purifying Faith. If they had a right under&s;tanding of the&s;e things, they would not be &s;o ea&s;y, quiet, joyful in their Sinful Peri&s;hing Condition, as they often are. If they had a right, clear, realizing view of the endle&s;s Torments of Hell which wait for the Impenitent, and of the endle&s;s Matchle&s;s Glories which &s;hall be the Portion of Sincere Saints; then they would not be &s;o ea&s;y and quiet while liable to the former and uninter|re&s;ted in the latter, as they often are. Tis &s;aid,

P&s;al. 9.10. <HI>They that know thy Name will put their tru&s;t in thee, for thou Lord ha&s;t not for&s;aken them that &s;eek thee.</HI> Therefore tis very much from an <HI>Ignorance</HI> of God and Chri&s;t, and the ab&s;olute need of an Intere&s;t in his favour, that Sinners are &s;o backward and unwilling to ac|cept of Go&s;pel Offers and Invitations.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>From the Hardne&s;s of their Hearts.</HI> They not only have a great Ignorance of God, and of the things of God, of the duties they owe to him, and the need they have of his favour; but there's al&s;o in them a ba&s;e, vile contrariety of heart to that which they do know of God. Their hearts are &s;o hard, &s;o &s;trongly &s;et again&s;t Gods Authority, &s;o bent to wickedne&s;s; that they often neglect to do what they know is Duty, and commit what they know is Sin. And &s;o they are &s;aid to <HI>Love darkne&s;s rather than light &mdash; to hate the light,</HI> Joh. 3.19, 20. They <HI>hold the Truth in Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s &mdash; when they knew God, they glorified him not as God</HI> &mdash; Tho' they know that &s;uch and &s;uch things <HI>are worthy of Death, yet they not only do them, but take plea&s;ure in tho&s;e that do them,</HI> Rom. 1.18, 21, 32. <HI>They &s;ay unto God, depart from us; for we de&s;ire not the knowledge of thy ways,</HI> Job 21.14.

This backwardne&s;s to accept of Go&s;pel Invitations, is often furthered:</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>By their accu&s;toming them&s;elves to Sin.</HI> The root, habit, principle of Sin in the Soul, which
<PB N="97" REF="001789_0100_0FB8293526D8DAD0">
is commonly call'd <HI>Original Sin:</HI> is often &s;treng|then'd, increas'd, confirm'd and e&s;tabli&s;h'd (as it were) by a continued cu&s;tomarine&s;s in Sin|ning. The longer men live in Sin, the more they u&s;e and accu&s;tom them&s;elves to it: &s;o much the more they commonly love it: &s;o much the more unwilling they u&s;ually are to leave and for&s;ake it. He that has been long us'd to Drunkenne&s;s, is not ea&s;ily brought to for|&s;ake it. He that has been long us'd to filthy Unclean Practices, is not ea&s;ily brought to be cha&s;t and pure.

Jer. 13.23. <HI>Can the Ethiopian change his &s;kin, or the Leopard his &s;pots? then may ye al&s;o do good, that are accu&s;tomed to do evil.</HI> So that in general, Mens backwardne&s;s and unwilling|ne&s;s to accept of Go&s;pel Offers and Invitations. proceeds from the depravation and corruption of their Nature by the Fall, by <HI>Adam's</HI> Apo&s;ta|&s;ie from God. It's a great evil, to refu&s;e Go&s;|pel Offers; but the depravation of Man's Na|ture is the cau&s;e of all Moral evils, both of Omi&s;&s;ion and Commi&s;&s;ion. Indeed tis great part of the work of Go&s;pel Grace, to cure this depravation in the Soul; but this Malady na|turally re&s;i&s;ts the remedy, till conquer'd, and &s;ubdu'd by Sovereign Almighty Grace.

<HEAD>USE. We may hence infer,</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. <HI>We ought to con&s;ider and deeply bewail the Depravation and Corruption of our Nature.</HI> As we come from fallen <HI>Adam,</HI> we're wofully depra|ved

And tho' God of His Infinite Grace, has given His Son to &s;ave Sinners, and Invites us to ac|cept this Salvation; yet &s;uch it our Ignorance and Wickedne&s;s Naturally, that we are prone to neglect and reject this great Salvation. We are prone to reject this only and All-&s;ufficient Remedy which is Offer'd us. We are Natu|rally Dead in Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and in Sins.

They're often &s;o di&s;re&s;ted by their accu&s;ing Con&s;ciences, that they're afraid of them&s;elves (as it were) afraid to be alone, afraid to give way to any &s;erious thinking.

puts the Godly beyond the reach of all Per&s;e|cutors.

What if our Hou&s;es, Lands, E&s;tates &s;hould be taken a|way by Per&s;ecutors? Why if they were not thus taken away, yet Death would &s;oon &s;epa|rate us from them.

<P N="1">1. <HI>That Servants ought to Obey their Ma&s;ters.</HI> All Per&s;ons are not on a Level; order mu&s;t be upheld in the World. The Superiors in a Family, &s;hould be Obeyed by their Inferiors: Parents, and Ma&s;ters, by their Children and Servants.

Col. 3.22. <HI>Servants, Obey in all things your Ma&s;ters according to the fle&s;h.</HI> Tit. 2.9. <HI>Ex|hort Servants to be Obedient to their own Masters, and to plea&s;e them well in all things.</HI> Thus, God the Maker and Ma&s;ter of all Men, requires Servants to Obey all the Commands of their Ma&s;ters; that is all lawful Commands.

They &s;hould teach them <HI>to deny Ungodline&s;s and World ly Lusts, and to live Soberly, Righteou&s;ly, Godly in this pre&s;ent evil World,</HI> Tit. 2.12. They &s;hould plainly tell Men from Gods word, That <HI>it &s;hall go well with the Righteous, they &s;hall eat the fruit of their doings; but wo &s;hall be to the wicked, for the reward of their hands &s;hall be given them.</HI> I&s;ai. 3.10, 11.

<P N="3">3. <HI>The Damned will have the wor&s;t Companions that can be in their Mi&s;ery.</HI> The Damned will be ill Companions to one another, and Doubt|le&s;s (one way or other) help to promote each others Mi&s;ery. The Wicked often love one another's Company in this World, but Doubtle&s;s they will rather dread it in Hell, but cannot avoid it. Will they not Dread to hear the Doleful Groans, Piercing Cries and Screetches of Damned, Tormented Wretches; and to hear the Cur&s;es and Upbraidings of their former Wicked Companions? But Damned Men mu&s;t not only Company with one another which Doubtle&s;s will increa&s;e their Mi&s;ery; but mu&s;t al&s;o be Plagued and Tormented with Devils forever. The Devils are Apo&s;tate Spirits, Apo&s;tate Angels, Impla|cable Enemies to God and Men; they are full of Murder, Malice, Spite and mo&s;t Cur&s;ed Rage; the&s;e Tygers, the&s;e Roaring Lions of Hell; Damned Men mu&s;t be with for ever and ever. The <HI>Sentence</HI> to be Pronounc'd again&s;t them is that, Mat. 25.41. <HI>Depart from me ye Cur&s;ed, into Everla&s;ting Fire prepared for the De|vil and his Angels.</HI> When the Angels Sinned, God was &s;o Provoked with them that He &s;pared them not; He pre&s;ently put them into Chains of Darkne&s;s re&s;erving them
<PB N="187" REF="001789_0190_0FB82AA62146D068">
to the Judgment of the Great Day. And the&s;e Cur&s;ed Rebels, from the very fir&s;t of their Apo&s;tacy till the <HI>Great Day of Judgment</HI> comes; are with all their <HI>Might, Power, Policy</HI> op|po&s;ing the Honour and Glory of God as far as po&s;&s;ibly they can: And has not (think you) the Infinitely <HI>Holy</HI> and <HI>Powerful</HI> GOD, prepa|red Terrible <HI>Torments</HI> for &s;uch Early, Ob&s;ti|nate long Continued Rebels as they are? Yes mo&s;t certainly. Well, with the&s;e Damned Devils, Damned Men mu&s;t have their part for ever. How far the&s;e Tormented Devils will be <HI>In&s;trumental</HI> in Tormenting of Damned Men, no Tongue of Man can Declare. Doubtle&s;s the&s;e Devils full of all Spite Malice and Rage, will <HI>Inconceivably Vex, Plague</HI> and <HI>Torment</HI> them. When Satan was permitted, how <HI>Grievou&s;ly</HI> did he Torment the <HI>Body</HI> of Holy <HI>Job</HI> for a while? When he was permitted to to <HI>take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion</HI> of &s;ome Per&s;ons, he made them Wander about <HI>Night and Day, in Mountains and Tombs, crying and cutting them&s;elves with Stones,</HI> Mark. 5.5. He <HI>often threw them into the Fire, and often into the Water,</HI> Mat. 17.15. And if his Limited, Chained Rage wrought &s;uch Terrible Effects as the&s;e; what will he do to the Damned in Hell, when all Re&s;traints are taken from his Malice, and Damned Men intirely given up to &s;uffer Vengeance? Doubtle&s;s, when God gives up the Wicked to the full Blow of His Holy Wrath and Vengeance, He'll &s;uffer exa&s;|perated Devils, to be In&s;trumental of Inconcei|vable <HI>Perplexity</HI> and <HI>Vexation</HI> to them. And as for tho&s;e who Pari&s;h from under the Go&s;pel, how Terribly may the Devil Twit them, Up|braid

them, and Triumph over them? May they not &s;ay to them?</P>
<P><Q>By our own Folly we have brought our &s;elves into this Mi&s;ery, but you are greater Fools than we. When are Sinned, no Remedy was propo&s;ed to us, no Salvation was ever Offered us; but you had Salva|tion through Chri&s;t Offered to you, and you would not Accept it. God waited to be Gracious to you, He u&s;ed long Patience; He often call'd on you by you Parents, Ma&s;ters, Neighbours, Mini&s;ters, by the checks and awakenings of your own Con&s;ciences, by the Motions and Strivings of His Spirit; but you refu&s;ed all the&s;e.

<P>If the Devils &s;hould thus upbraid Damned Men, and their awakened Con&s;ciences bear the &s;ame te&s;timony, and as a never dying Worm graw upon them, filling them with &s;uch Self-condemning Reflections; how unutterably Tormenting mu&s;t this needs be?</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>They &s;hall be Tormented in their whole Man, both Body and Soul.</HI> When the wicked die, their Souls go to Hell Torments, <HI>Luke</HI> 16.22, 23. But after a while, the Re&s;urrection of the Dead and Day of Judgment &s;hall come; and then both

In this World, great extremity of Pain if in but <HI>one Tooth, one Finger, one Toe,</HI> any one Part or Joint of the Body; it's counted almo&s;t intol|lerable; what then will it be, when all the Parts of the Body and all the Faculties of the Soul &s;hall be quite fill'd with Mi&s;ery and Tor|ment? The Damned are call'd, Rom. 9.22. <HI>Ve&s;&s;els of Wrath fitted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> De&s;truction.

In this World they were <HI>Ve&s;&s;els of Sin,</HI> full of Sin, the <HI>Servants</HI> of it, their <HI>Members</HI> being <HI>In&s;truments of Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> (Rom. 6.13, 17.) wholly Imploy'd in Sin's Service: in the next World, they'l be <HI>Ve&s;&s;els of Wrath,</HI> fill'd brim-full with the Tormenting Wrath and Vengeance of the Lord God Almighty. And when thus Tormented in all their Parts, Powers, Faculties, how inconceiveably terrible will it be!</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>God will Glorifie Him&s;elf in Puni&s;hing and Tormenting of them.</HI> On the Judgment Day and for ever after, God will Eminently Glorify His Mercy on the Ve&s;&s;els of Mercy; and His Wrath

on the Ve&s;&s;els of Wrath. That time therefore is called with re&s;pect to the Wicked, <HI>The day of Wrath, and the Revelation of the Righteous Judg|ment of God,</HI> Rom. 2.5. God will then fully, clearly, evidently <HI>Reveal Di&s;cover, Manife&s;t</HI> to the whole World; that He's Infinitely <HI>Holy, Ju&s;t Righteous</HI> in pouring out His mo&s;t terrible Wrath and Vengeance on the Wicked. They &s;hall be <HI>Puni&s;h'd with everla&s;ting destruction, from the Pre&s;ence of the Lord and from the Glory of His Power,</HI> 2 The&s;. 1.9. God will then Di&s;play and Glorifie, His Infinite <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>Power</HI> too, in Puni&s;hing the Unbelieving and Di&s;obedient. In this World, He Glorifies His Patience and Forbearance to them; but then He'l Glorifie His Ju&s;tice and Power in Tormenting of them. And when the Great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d &s;ets Him&s;elf on pur|po&s;e (as it were) to &s;how the greatne&s;s of His Revenging Ju&s;tice, and of His Power, will He not do it wonderfully beyond all we can conceive of? Yes indeed He will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> When Men have a mind to give the brighte&s;t di&s;co|veries of their <HI>Strength, Ingenuity, Skill</HI> in any matter; then they commonly &s;tretch their Fa|culties (as it were) and exert them&s;elves to the uttermo&s;t. Surely then, when God de&s;igns eminently to di&s;cover and glorify, His <HI>Reven|ging Justice and Great Power</HI> in Puni&s;hing the Wicked; their Puni&s;hment mu&s;t be Inconcei|vably terrible indeed. He'l remember again&s;t them all their Sins in Thought, Word &amp; Deed; all the Aggravations of them: and He'l Inflict the full weight of Wrath for every Sin. He'l abate them nothing, He'l Puni&s;h them accor|ding to their ways, and according to the fruit
<PB N="191" REF="001789_0194_0FB82AAFDDFEE8C8">
of their doings. When the promoting and manife&s;ting His own Glory, is thus concern'd in Puni&s;hing, Plaguing, Tormenting of them; Surely He'l render them Inconceivably Mi|&s;erable.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Their Puni&s;hment will be Eternal.</HI> In this World, it's often a relief to tho&s;e in great Pain or Trouble, to <HI>hope</HI> that it wont la&s;t long: if it were not for hope the heart would break. Well, but the Torments of the Damned, will never have any end at all: they'l have no Intermi&s;&s;ion, Mitigation, nor Ce&s;&s;ation for ever. Their Mi&s;ery is call'd, <HI>Everla&s;ting Puni&s;hment,</HI> Mat. 25.46. <HI>Everla&s;ting Destruction,</HI> 2 The&s;. 1.9. They mu&s;t go into <HI>Everla&s;ting Fire,</HI> their <HI>Worm never dies,</HI> their <HI>Fire is never quenched.</HI></P>
<P>Thus I have indeavoured in &s;ome Mea&s;ure to &s;how, that the Future Mi&s;ery of the Damned will be exceeding great; but how Great, how Terrible, no Tongue of Man can tell. The Scripture &s;ets it forth by tho&s;e things, which are mo&s;t Terrible to the pre&s;ent apprehen&s;ion of our Sen&s;es; but twill be never fully under|&s;tood till fully endured. The Scripture &s;ome|times &s;ets forth the Future Glory of the Saints, by tho&s;e things which are commonly mo&s;t va|lu'd and e&s;teem'd by Men in this World, as by a <HI>Crown,</HI> a <HI>Kingdom,</HI> an <HI>Inheritance,</HI> &amp;c. and yet it &s;ays, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.2. <HI>It doth not yet appear what we &s;hall be.</HI> Notwith&s;tanding all that's &s;aid about the Future Glory of the Saints; yet it does not fully appear at pre&s;ent, how Great
<PB N="192" REF="001789_0195_0FB82AB164A2BD08">
and Eminent it will be. Eye has not &s;een, nor Ear heard, nor has it entred into the Heart of Man fully to conceive at pre&s;ent; the good things God has prepar'd for them that love Him, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.9. So, notwith&s;tanding all that's &s;aid about the Future Mi&s;ery of the Damned; yet it does not fully appear at pre&s;ent, how Great and Terrible it will be. Eye has not &s;een, nor Ear heard, nor can the Heart of Man at pre&s;ent fully conceive, what Rivers, what Tor|menting Floods of Divine Vengeance will for|ever be poured out on the Ungodly. Yet all this Inconceivable Mi&s;ery, will mo&s;t certainly be the Portion of all that refu&s;e Chri&s;t, &amp; neglect the Great Salvation Offer'd to them. Surely then we &s;hould bethink our &s;elves, we &s;hould flee from this Terrible Wrath which is to come. If we &s;hould Peri&s;h from under the Go&s;pel, our Condition will be more terrible than theirs of <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah.</HI> If we &s;hould Peri&s;h, how terrible will it be, to con&s;ider of and reflect on our own Folly and Wickedne&s;s. To con&s;ider how long we liv'd under the Go&s;pel, how ma|ny Precious Offers of Salvation we had, how frequently and fervently we were urg'd to mind the welfare of our Souls, and yet that we Fooli&s;hly and Wickedly neglected the things of our Peace in the time of them; Sure|ly, no Heart can conceive the Angui&s;h, Ter|ror, Horror that will be produc'd by &s;uch re|flections. To think, if we had heartily Obey'd the Go&s;pel as many others did, we &s;hould now have been in Glory as well as they, with <HI>Abra|ham, I&s;aac, Jacob, the Holy Prophets</HI> and all Sin|cere Believers; but Fools, Wretches, Self-De&s;troyers,
<PB N="193" REF="001789_0196_0FB82AB5E1F7B978">
Self-Murderers that we were, we gave way to the Temptations of Satan, the Cor|ruptions of our own Hearts; were more fond of Shadows, Trifles, Momentany Vanities, than of Eternal Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s; by this our Folly and Wickedne&s;s, we have lo&s;t Inconceiveable Eter|nal Glories, and brought on our &s;elves the&s;e In|tollerable Plagues that can never be got rid of; I &s;ay, &s;uch Reflections as the&s;e will be In|conceiveably Tormenting. Let all of us there|fore be in good Earne&s;t about our Souls, &s;earch and try our ways and turn to the Lord. Let us with utmo&s;t Speed, Sincerity and Dili|gence, Repent of all our Sins, Submit to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t on Go&s;pel Terms, Imploying all that we are and have for Him: if we thus do, it &s;hall be well with us for ever. If we thus do, then, <HI>When Chri&s;t who is our Life &s;hall appear, we al&s;o &s;hall appear with Him in Glory,</HI> Col. 3.4. But if we neglect Chri&s;t, our Doom is that, P&s;al. 9.17. <HI>The Wicked &s;hall be turned into Hell, with all the Nations that forget God.</HI></P>
