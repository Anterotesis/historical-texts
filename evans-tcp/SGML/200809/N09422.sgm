<HEAD>THE APPEAL FARTHER DEFENDED.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the Author of <HI>an Appeal to the Public, in Behalf of the Church of En|gland in America,</HI> publi&s;hed his general <HI>Defence</HI> of it, he was in Hopes of having no farther Occa&s;ion to appear in the Controver&s;y about AMERICAN BISHOPS. Not that he looked upon what he had written as unan&s;werable; for he knew that there is a Sort of People that can <HI>an&s;wer</HI> any Thing; but he believed that enough had been &s;aid on the Subject, on both Sides, to enable the Public to judge of the Matter in Di&s;pute. The Ca&s;e of the American Epi&s;copalians had been fair|ly &s;tated, in Order to &s;hew the Rea&s;onablene&s;s and Nece&s;&s;ity of their having re&s;ident Bi&s;hops; on the other Hand, Objections in &s;ufficient Quantity, had been offered again&s;t &s;uch an Appointment; and a particular Reply had been made to every Objection that had been urged or &s;ugge&s;ted: And when a Controver&s;y is carried on thus far, the By-&s;tanders, in his Opinion, are commonly as able to form a proper Judgment of the Merits of the Cau&s;e, as after the Di&s;putants have proceeded to Rejoinders, Sur-rejoinders and Rebutters.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="012007_0009_0F8940DF2DD571B8">WHETHER Dr. <HI>Chauncy</HI> is of a different Opinion or not, is be&s;t known to him&s;elf. As he has not thought proper to tell what Motives excited him to <HI>re&s;ume</HI> his Pen in this Controver&s;y, the Reader is left to di&s;cover them for him&s;elf, as well as he can; and if he &s;hould happen to mi&s;take, in a Matter of &s;uch high Curio&s;ity, it may not be his own Fault. Surely it could not be the <HI>Plea&s;ure</HI> attending &s;uch an Employment! For my Part, I am unable to conceive that any Man can be <HI>fond</HI> of the rough and di&s;agreeable Work of public Controver&s;y, more e&s;pecially at the Doctor's <HI>Time of Life:</HI>&mdash;Unle&s;s he &s;hould be in the Condition of old <HI>Henry Vale&s;ius,</HI> of whom his Biographer informs us, in Words which I &s;hall leave for the Doctor to tran&s;late, that
<Q>natus Annis <HI>&s;eptuaginta,</HI> nec &s;ibi ip&s;e videbatur Senex, nec aliis videri volebat;</Q>
and that he candidly confe&s;&s;ed, that
<Q>ante acceptas qua&s;dem a Gronovio Literas, Se de Senectute &s;ua nunquam cogitavi&s;&s;e.</Q>
And therefore I ra|ther &s;u&s;pect that Dr. <HI>Chauncy</HI> was &s;en&s;ible of the In&s;ufficiency of his former Exertions again&s;t an American Epi&s;copate, and found it nece&s;&s;ary to make another Effort to &s;upport the Cau&s;e he had undertaken to maintain. And if he had a farther View of retrieving his own literary Character, he is not to be blamed; for, in the Opinion of many &s;en&s;ible People, <HI>that,</HI> as well as his Cau&s;e, had con&s;iderably &s;uffered, by the Appearance and Ope|ration of a certain noxious Pamphlet, known by the Title of&mdash;THE APPEAL DEFENDED.</P>
<P>BUT I will not &s;pend Time in trying to account for what, after all, may be <HI>unaccountable</HI>; nor in|deed can the Doctor expect me to take the Trouble of &s;ettling his Affairs with his Readers. It is more
<PB N="3" REF="012007_0010_0F8940DFEE94B2A8">
properly my Bu&s;ine&s;s, at this Time, to a&s;&s;ign the Rea&s;ons why I reque&s;t again to be heard
<Q>before the Tribunal of the Public,</Q>
after having offered my Plea in Behalf of the American Epi&s;copalians, and made my DEFENCE.</P>
<P>AND here I might plead the natural Right every Man has to defend him&s;elf as often as he is attack|ed; and that it is the proper Bu&s;ine&s;s of a Re&s;pon|dent to reply to every Thing objected by his Oppo|nent: But I &s;hall not avail my&s;elf of the&s;e Con&s;i|derations, becau&s;e I mu&s;t confe&s;s that I have not been governed by them my&s;elf. In the Doctor's la&s;t Piece, now coming under Examination, the Attack never appeared to me to be &s;o formidable as to make a regular Defence nece&s;&s;ary; nor the Objections a|gain&s;t an American Epi&s;copate to be of &s;uch Con|&s;equence as to de&s;erve a formal Reply. I could very freely, without Anxiety or Reluctance, have &s;ub|mitted the Matter in Di&s;pute to the Judgment of the impartial, without offering another Sentence on the Subject.</P>
<P>BUT the Misfortune is, that, while many undertake to be Judges, in this Ca&s;e, without any De&s;ire or Inclination to examine what is &s;aid <HI>on the other Side,</HI> there are but few Per&s;ons, in tho&s;e Colonies wherein Dr. <HI>Chauncy</HI>'s Pamphlets have chiefly abounded, (and for which I have an Affection as well as he) who have an Op|portunity of reading what has been offered in Favour of the Epi&s;copate propo&s;ed. With Re|gard to tho&s;e Colonies therefore, which are the chief Objects of the Doctor's Concern, he and his Adherents, one would think, might have been very quiet and contented with &s;o con&s;iderable an Advan|tage.
<PB N="4" REF="012007_0011_0F8940E0AD2484C0">
But no: They were alarmed, it &s;eems, for what he calls, p. 141, <HI>the great Cau&s;e</HI> of their An|ce&s;tors; and it was feared that even the Report, or oral Tradition, of what had been urged in Behalf of American Bi&s;hops, might render the People of New-England favourable to the Plan for introduc|ing them into the Colonies. It was therefore thought proper, by Way of Prevention or Anti|dote, and perhaps at the &s;ame Time as a <HI>Cordial</HI> for the Doctor after &s;o great a Fatigue as he had lately undergone in <HI>an&s;wering</HI> the <HI>Appeal</HI>; that the <HI>Thanks</HI> of his <HI>a&s;&s;ociated</HI> Brethren &s;hould be formally voted him for the Exploit; and that this Vote &s;hould be circulated through the Country in the <HI>public Pa|pers</HI>: By which Contrivance much greater Force was given to his Pamphlet than it originally po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed. For the Body of the People in New-England, who had heard &s;o little in Behalf of the Bi&s;hops propo&s;ed, and &s;o much again&s;t them; upon &s;eeing this Decree of a public Triumph or <HI>Ovation</HI> made in Favour of the Doctor; had it hardly in their Power to conceive otherwi&s;e, than that the Author of the <HI>Appeal</HI> had been fairly vanqui&s;hed, and that the epi&s;copal Clergy and their Friends, under the Cover of plau&s;ible Pretences, had formed a Plot to deprive them of their religious Liberties, to e&s;ta|bli&s;h over them an eccle&s;ia&s;tical Juri&s;diction of a tyrannical Nature, and to rai&s;e high Contributions upon them, for the Support of&mdash;it as had been originally objected.</P>
<P>IN Order therefore to undeceive them, and any others who have been impo&s;ed upon by the&s;e or the like Arts; and to &s;hew that, notwith&s;tanding the Pretence, none of the&s;e Objections have been to|lerably &s;upported, and indeed that no Objection of
<PB N="5" REF="012007_0012_0F8940E16D63F6F0">
any Con&s;equence can be rea&s;onably made again&s;t an Epi&s;copate on the Plan that has been offered; the Author has been urged by many of his Friends, to make this <HI>farther Defence</HI> of it; which they think to be nece&s;&s;ary under &s;uch Circum&s;tances. As his own Opinion differed not greatly from theirs, he &s;oon con&s;ented to &s;ubmit to the Ta&s;k<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">What is <HI>now</HI> pre&s;ented to the Reader, would have ap|peared much &s;ooner, had not the Author waited to &s;ee what Productions worthy of Notice, the Publication of the <HI>Ap|peal</HI> and <HI>Appeal defended</HI> in LONDON, might occa&s;ion in that Quarter.</NOTE>; and in per|forming it he will endeavour to &s;hew, among other Things, that there is a fairer and better Way of judging of the Matters in Di&s;pute, than either from the public <HI>Vote of Thanks</HI> before-mentioned, or from the Doctor's confidently &s;aying, in his Title Page, that in his <HI>Reply</HI> to the <HI>Appeal defended,</HI> the Author's <HI>Mi&s;takes are rectified, his fal&s;e arguing refuted, and the Objections again&s;t the planned Ame|rican Epi&s;copate &s;hewn to remain in full Force, not|with&s;tanding all that he has offered to render them invalid.</HI></P>
<P>THE Doctor's Pamphlet is entitled, A <HI>Reply</HI> to the <HI>Appeal defended</HI>; but the Reader mu&s;t not con|clude from hence, that it is, in any Sen&s;e, a Reply to the <HI>whole</HI> of it. The larger Part, containing many Things that are very material in this Con|trover&s;y, is pa&s;&s;ed over without the lea&s;t Notice. I &s;hall not follow the Doctor's Example in this; intending, &s;ince I have undertaken a Review of his Performance, not to pa&s;s by any Thing that can be thought to be either pertinent or plau&s;ible.</P>
<P>IN taking my Leave of him, I propo&s;ed, in Ca&s;e the Di&s;pute about an American Epi&s;copate
<PB N="6" REF="012007_0013_0F8940E22CA50420">
&s;hould be farther continued,

But he will not allow that I had any Right to propo&s;e &s;uch a Limitation; &s;ince in the <HI>Appeal</HI> and the <HI>Appeal defended,</HI> I had not &s;trictly adhered to the Point of an American Epi&s;copate my&s;elf. But I know of nothing in the <HI>Appeal</HI> that does not immediately relate to this Point, except the two fir&s;t Sections, wherein a 'Sketch' of the general Arguments in Favour of Epi&s;copacy was given, and the Nature of the epi&s;copal Office was explained. The&s;e were <HI>introductory</HI> to the Bu&s;ine&s;s in Hand, and were thought to have a Tendency to put the Plea for the Epi&s;copate reque&s;ted in a pro|per Light, by &s;hewing that the late Application of our <HI>Convention</HI> for American Bi&s;hops proceeded from their real <HI>Principles</HI>; which was certainly the Ca&s;e. But &s;eeing the ill U&s;e made of the&s;e intro|ductory Sections by my Adver&s;aries, in my <HI>Defence,</HI> I pa&s;&s;ed over all that had been &s;aid on the general Subject of Epi&s;copacy, &s;o far as relates to the E|vidence of Scripture and the primitive Church; being de&s;irous of reducing the Controver&s;y to one Point; namely, the Rea&s;onablene&s;s and Propriety of an <HI>American</HI> Epi&s;copate.</P>
<P>DR. <HI>Chauncy,</HI> in his fir&s;t Pamphlet, had not only enlarged on the introductory Sections, but had rambled beyond the Bounds of the <HI>Appeal,</HI> in a long Epi&s;ode about the Sentiments of our fir&s;t Reformers, (to &s;ay nothing of other In&s;tances) in Order invidiou&s;ly to repre&s;ent the epi&s;copal Clergy in the Colonies as having departed from the origi|nal

Principles of the Church of England: And I found it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;pend no incon&s;iderable Part of my Reply in &s;etting this Matter in its proper Light.&mdash;After what had thus pa&s;&s;ed between us, I think I had a Right to
<Q>propo&s;e a new Plan of Operations,</Q>
in Ca&s;e Ho&s;tilities &s;hould continue; which I did&mdash;not intending, as he mi&s;repre&s;ents the Matter, <HI>to put it out of the Power of others to re|mark upon the greate&s;t Part of what I had been plea&s;ed to offer,</HI>&mdash;but only de&s;iring that a due Regard to the Patience of our Readers, upon which we had tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed, might, for the future, be more care|fully maintained. The Doctor is of Opinion in|deed, that if <HI>I had taken the whole</HI> of the above|mentioned Mi&s;conduct <HI>upon my&s;elf, no one would have thought it an</HI> ASPERSION. I am of the &s;ame Opinion too; becau&s;e no one before <HI>him</HI> ever <HI>did</HI> think of calling That an <HI>A&s;per&s;ion,</HI> which a Man <HI>takes upon him&s;elf.</HI> It is po&s;&s;ible he intended to &s;ay a <HI>Self-A&s;per&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>I HAD farther propo&s;ed, &s;hould the Controver&s;y be continued,
<Q>that no Invective or Abu&s;e,&mdash;no|thing that &s;avors of Bigotry or Barbarity, &s;hould be &s;uffered to mingle in the Debate; but that inge|nuous, &s;ober Rea&s;oning &s;hould decide it.</Q>
The Doctor thinks I could <HI>have made the Propo&s;al with a better Grace, if I had more fully exemplified it</HI> my&s;elf. Indeed he immediately confe&s;&s;es, p. 6, (I reque&s;t the Reader to take particular Notice of the Pa&s;&s;age, becau&s;e it is the <HI>only</HI> one in which he &s;eems to be in a tolerably good Humour, while he &s;peaks of me) that my <HI>Air in writing &s;ometimes carries the Appearance of Mildne&s;s and Moderation; nor is it generally mi&s;becoming the Gentleman, or the Chri&s;tian.</HI> I will give him all due Credit for this

Conce&s;&s;ion; and I think it concerns me to make the mo&s;t of it.</P>
<P>BUT in the next Words he cries out concerning me: <HI>Will any pretend that his Manner is not too often very like their's who are actuated by a Spirit of Bigotry?</HI> Perhaps in &s;ome In&s;tances this may have been the Ca&s;e, although I am not con&s;cious of it my&s;elf, and am unable to point out in what particular Pa&s;&s;ages. I know the extreme Difficulty of carrying on a Controver&s;y with peevi&s;h and cap|tious Adver&s;aries, without &s;ometimes dropping Ex|pre&s;&s;ions that may appear, to an indifferent Per&s;on, to <HI>&s;avor of Bigotry,</HI> or a blind Confidence. But I can truly declare, that I have endeavoured to guard a|gain&s;t this Kind of Failings.&mdash;He goes on: <HI>Has he no where treated his Opponents with Invective and Abu&s;e?</HI> With &s;ome little <HI>Invective</HI> on certain Oc|ca&s;ions, I confe&s;s; but not with <HI>Abu&s;e,</HI> as the Word implies unkind or &s;evere Treatment that is unde&s;erved. <HI>Are there no In&s;tances in which he has had Recour&s;e to eva&s;ive Art, rather than &s;olid Ar|gument?</HI> Not a &s;ingle one, I affirm, to the be&s;t of my Knowledge. Again: <HI>Has he never &s;ub&s;tituted popular</HI> EXCLAMATION <HI>in the Room of good Rea&s;on|ing?</HI> &mdash;The Doctor mo&s;t probably meant here po|pular Declamation; as in p. 85, he complains of my having made <HI>a declamatory Application to the Pa&s;&s;ions.</HI> Popular <HI>Declamation</HI> is too often the Fault of controver&s;ial Writers; but as to <HI>popular Exclamation,</HI> it is

In a Word, I meant nothing in any Part of it, but to treat both the Doctor and the Public fairly; and if I failed in any In&s;tances, it was contrary to my De&s;ire and Intention, and it is more than hitherto I have been able to di&s;cover. What the Sentiments of my Friends are, upon this Head, I &s;hall leave for them to expre&s;s as they think proper.

In an introductory Ob&s;ervation I had reque&s;ted of every Reader to take Notice, that Dr. <HI>Chauncy,</HI> as well as my other Opponents, had given up the great Point in Di&s;pute.

<P>THE particular Pa&s;&s;ages alledged in Proof of the Doctor's having given up the great Point in Di&s;pute, by con&s;enting to the Epi&s;copate in Que&s;|tion, are the following. <HI>We de&s;ire no other Liberty, than to be left unmole&s;ted in the Exerci&s;e of our reli|gious Principles, in &s;o far as we are good Members of Society.

If they think Bi&s;hops, in their appropriated Sen&s;e, were con|&s;tituted by Chri&s;t, or his Apo&s;tles, we object not a Word again&s;t their having as many of them as they plea&s;e, if they will be content to have them with Au|thority altogether derived from Chri&s;t</HI> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">An&s;wer to the <HI>Appeal,</HI> p. 180.</NOTE>.

their having Bi&s;hops under a</HI> STATE ESTABLISH|MENT <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">An&s;wer to the <HI>Appeal,</HI> p. 189.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Doctor allows the Quotations to have been fairly made; and the Que&s;tion here is, whether in the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages, he does, or does not, con&s;ent to our having the Epi&s;copate propo&s;ed in the <HI>Appeal.</HI> In order fairly to determine this Point, Recour&s;e mu&s;t be fir&s;t had to the <HI>Appeal,</HI> that it may be &s;een what Sort of an Epi&s;copate it propo&s;es, and whether it be the &s;ame that the Doctor con&s;ents to. Now this is clearly and fully de&s;cribed in the fol|lowing Words.
<Q>It has been long &s;ettled by our Friends and Superiors at home, and the Clergy of this Country have often &s;ignified their Ap|probation thereof, and Acquie&s;cence therein&mdash; that the Bi&s;hop to be &s;ent to America, &s;hall have no Authority, but <HI>purely of a &s;piritual and eccle|&s;ia&s;tical Nature, &s;uch as is derived altogether from the Church, and not from the State</HI>&mdash;that this Au|thority &s;hall operate only upon the Clergy of the Church, and not upon the Laity nor Di&s;&s;enters of any Denomination&mdash;that the Bi&s;hops &s;hall not interfere with the Property or Privileges, whe|ther civil or religious, of Churchmen or Di&s;&s;en|ters &mdash;that, in particular, they &s;hall have no Con|cern with the Probate of Wills, Letters of Guar|dian&s;hip and Admini&s;tration, or Marriage-Li|cences, nor be Judges of any Ca&s;es relating thereto&mdash;but, that they &s;hall ONLY <HI>exerci&s;e the original Duties of their Office</HI> as before &s;tated, <HI>i. e. ordain and govern the Clergy, and admini&s;ter Con|firmation</HI> to tho&s;e who &s;hall de&s;ire it. This, without any Re&s;ervation or Equivocation, is the exact Plan of an American Epi&s;copate which has
<PB N="12" REF="012007_0019_0F8940E76E862030">
been &s;ettled at home; and it is the <HI>only one,</HI> on which Bi&s;hops have been reque&s;ted here, either in our general or more particular Addre&s;&s;es<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the <HI>Appeal,</HI> p. 79.</NOTE>.</Q>
Nor is there any Thing, in any Part of the <HI>Appeal,</HI> from which it can be infered, that a different E|pi&s;copate from this was intended or de&s;ired.</P>
<P>NOW the Doctor, in the Pa&s;&s;ages quoted, de|clares for him&s;elf, as well as in Behalf of others, that he is willing we &s;hould have as many Bi|&s;hops as we want, provided only, that we are <HI>content to have them with</HI> AUTHORITY ALTOGETHER DERIVED FROM CHRIST&mdash;that they are PURELY SPIRITUAL&mdash;and not upon the Footing of a STATE ESTABLISHMENT. But the&s;e are &s;pecifically and ex|actly the very Bi&s;hops propo&s;ed in the <HI>Appeal.</HI> The Bi&s;hops reque&s;ted are tho&s;e expre&s;sly &s;aid
<Q>to have no Authority, but &s;uch as is derived altogether from the Church,</Q>
and con&s;equently ALTOGETHER FROM CHRIST. Their Authority and Powers are to be intirely 'of an eccle&s;ia&s;tical Nature,' they being intended only
<Q>to ordain and govern the Clergy, and to admini&s;ter Confirmation;</Q>
and con&s;equently they are to be PURELY SPIRITUAL.</P>
<P>THE Government is not expected or de&s;ired to give them any Support or peculiar Protection; and con&s;equently they are not to be on the Foot|ing of a STATE ESTABLISHMENT. From the&s;e <HI>Pre|mi&s;es</HI> every Reader can, and every unbia&s;&s;ed Reader will, draw the <HI>Con&s;equence</HI> for him&s;elf, that THERE|FORE Dr. <HI>Chauncy</HI> allows of the Epi&s;copate propo|&s;ed in the <HI>Appeal,</HI> and has given up the great Point in Di&s;pute.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="012007_0020_0F8940E82E898F18">HE a&s;&s;erts notwith&s;tanding, that the Bi&s;hops in the above-mentioned Plan, and tho&s;e he &s;poke of in the above recited Pa&s;&s;ages, are ESSENTIALLY DIF|FERENT &mdash;<HI>as widely different, as this World is from another.</HI> But what A&s;&s;urance is this! A Man that can affirm at this Rate, is fit to undertake, what a common Genius will not attempt, to prove that 'Darkne&s;s is Light, and Light Darkne&s;s.' I would willingly put the mo&s;t favourable Con&s;truction upon this Conduct; and therefore I impute it to the Perplexity he was under, which did not permit him to &s;ee what is &s;o evident to others.</P>
<P>AND indeed he &s;eems to have puzzled and con|fu&s;ed him&s;elf not a little, with the Term <HI>&s;piritual Bi&s;hops.</HI> For &s;ometimes he u&s;es it in the Sen&s;e wherein all Mankind have ever under&s;tood it, as &s;ignifying Bi&s;hops that have
<Q>no Authority but of a &s;piritual and eccle&s;ia&s;tical Nature, &s;uch as is derived altogether from the Church and not from the State,</Q>
which are the Bi&s;hops of the <HI>Appeal.</HI> Thus he allows, p. 92, that we might have purely <HI>&s;piritual Bi&s;hops,</HI> by applying to the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Ca|nada</HI> or the <HI>Moravians.</HI> But why then may we not have Bi&s;hops <HI>as</HI> &s;piritual, if we receive them from England? Ordination to the &s;ame Office, by any one Bi&s;hop in Chri&s;tendom, conveys exactly the &s;ame Authority, to the &s;ame Degree, as Ordinati|on by any other Bi&s;hop, according to the Opinion of the Church in all Ages; and the Powers thus conveyed are not temporal, but &s;piritual. The tem|poral Powers which Bi&s;hops po&s;&s;e&s;s in any Coun|try, are not derived from their Ordination, but confered upon them by &s;ome Law or Act of the State. Where Bi&s;hops receive &s;uch Powers, they are in Part temporal Bi&s;hops; but where they re|ceive
<PB N="14" REF="012007_0021_0F8940E8ECDCE0E8">
none, they are <HI>purely &s;piritual.</HI> Before the Time of <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> all Bi&s;hops were &s;uch; and &s;ince his Time, Bi&s;hops, without any temporal Au|thority, are as <HI>purely &s;piritual</HI> as they were before it, every Power which belongs to them as Bi&s;hops be|ing of a &s;piritual Nature. The original and pecu|liar Powers of Bi&s;hops, are tho&s;e of Ordination, Government and Confirmation. Now the Doctor him&s;elf, p. 103, calls <HI>ordaining</HI> and <HI>governing</HI> Power <HI>&s;piritual</HI>; and for the &s;ame Rea&s;ons, <HI>confirming</HI> Pow|er mu&s;t be &s;piritual likewi&s;e. And when Bi&s;hops po&s;&s;e&s;s the&s;e Powers, without any Mixture of tem|poral Authority, they are <HI>purely &s;piritual.</HI> But in other Places, and particularly wherever he denies that &s;piritual Bi&s;hops are the &s;ame with tho&s;e of the <HI>Appeal,</HI> he u&s;es the Words in a Sen&s;e that is exclu&s;ively his own; and by <HI>purely &s;piritual</HI> Bi|&s;hops, he evidently means Bi&s;hops that are <HI>pure</HI> SPIRITS, without any bodily Qualities; which la&s;t, it &s;eems, are the only Bi&s;hops he is now willing to allow us.</P>
<P>HE appears to have been equally embarra&s;&s;ed with the word <HI>E&s;tabli&s;hment.</HI> The E&s;tabli&s;hment of a Religion, or of any particular Order of Men always implies, <HI>at lea&s;t,</HI> &s;ome <HI>peculiar</HI> Countenance and Pro|tection from the State, but all that is de&s;ired for the Bi&s;hops of the <HI>Appeal,</HI> is a Con&s;ent to their Exi|&s;tence, or, <HI>at mo&s;t,</HI> the Approbation of the Legi&s;|lature, and that <HI>common</HI> Protection which is freely granted to the various religious Denominations throughout the Briti&s;h Dominions. Nothing but wilful or natural Blindne&s;s can avoid &s;eeing, that there is a wide Difference between &s;uch a Tolera|tion, and a <HI>State-E&s;tabli&s;hment.</HI> The Doctor &s;ome|times u&s;es the Word <HI>E&s;tabli&s;hment</HI> in the Sen&s;e
<PB N="15" REF="012007_0022_0F8940E9ACD6AEF8">
wherein others u&s;e it; and it was not &s;u&s;pected that he departed from its common Acceptation in his <HI>An&s;wer</HI> to the <HI>Appeal.</HI> And therefore when he &s;ignified his Con&s;ent to our having Bi&s;hops that &s;hould not be under a <HI>State-E&s;tabli&s;hment,</HI> I made no Scruple to affirm, that he con&s;ented to the E|pi&s;copate of the <HI>Appeal,</HI> which was not to be under a <HI>State-E&s;tabli&s;hment,</HI> and con&s;equently that he had given up the main Point in Debate&mdash;which had he u&s;ed common Language in its common Acceptation, was certainly the Ca&s;e. In order to extricate him|&s;elf, he now declares in his <HI>Reply,</HI> that he &s;igni|fied no &s;uch Con&s;ent; and to my Que&s;tion&mdash;
<Q>Does this Plan propo&s;e an E&s;tabli&s;hment of the Church?</Q>
&mdash;He roundly an&s;wers, <HI>it undoubtedly does.</HI> p. 142. So that by <HI>E&s;tabli&s;hment</HI> now, he means no more than what is propo&s;ed in the <HI>Ap|peal</HI> for an American Epi&s;copate, which is exactly neither more nor le&s;s than what all con&s;i&s;tent Wri|ters mean by the word <HI>Toleration.</HI> And &s;uch are the Fervors of his anti-epi&s;copal Zeal, that he is un|willing American Bi&s;hops &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed in <HI>his</HI> Sen&s;e, <HI>i. e.</HI> tolerated, or &s;uffered to exi&s;t in any Form, excepting perhaps that of <HI>pure Spirits.</HI></P>
<P>I HAVE proceeded on the favourable Suppo&s;iti|on, that the Doctor was perplexed him&s;elf in the U&s;e of the&s;e Terms. If this was not the Ca&s;e, it was &s;till wor&s;e; for he mu&s;t have intended to per|plex his Readers. 'Phenomena' of this Kind &s;ome|times do appear 'in the Regions of Controver&s;y.' When a Writer is dextrous in playing Tricks with Words, he can, at any Time, rai&s;e a Mi&s;t, and make his E&s;cape; and when we think that we have &s;ecured him in Cords of his own twi&s;ting, we are &s;urprized to find, that&mdash;
<Q><PB N="16" REF="012007_0023_0F8940EA6C9204D8">Effugiet tamen haec &s;celeratus Vincula Proteus.</Q></P>
<P>THE Doctor complains that my Repre&s;entation of the Matter makes him to have <HI>wrote</HI> [written] <HI>many Scores of Pages in Oppo&s;ition to that, again&s;t which he had not a Word to object.</HI> p. 12&mdash;and to have <HI>acted a weak, ridiculous and incon&s;i&s;tent Part.</HI> p. 13. The Fact is truly repre&s;ented, whatever it may imply; and I am not an&s;werable for the Con|&s;equences. I am di&s;po&s;ed to think as favourably of him as po&s;&s;ible, and I could wi&s;h for no Occa|&s;ions of treating him otherwi&s;e than re&s;pectfully. And as to the Incon&s;i&s;tency before us, I am willing, as I have &s;aid, to a&s;cribe it, not to any Malice <HI>prepen&s;e,</HI> but to the Embarra&s;&s;ment he was under from the Badne&s;s of his Cau&s;e, and the urgent Nece&s;&s;ity of his &s;till defending it. The &s;ame Kind of Incon&s;i&s;tency, proceeding from the like Embar|ra&s;&s;ment, has appeared in all our Oppo&s;ers; par|ticularly in the <HI>American Whig,</HI> the <HI>Remon&s;trant,</HI> and another great Stickler again&s;t American Bi&s;hops, in the <HI>London Chronicle,</HI> who &s;igns him&s;elf <HI>Atlan|ticus.</HI> They oppo&s;e that again&s;t which they have no Objections; they give their Con&s;ent, and after|wards deny that they ever thought of con&s;enting at all.</P>
<P>THE la&s;t-mentioned Writer, in Order to
<Q>do Ju&s;tice to the Americans,</Q>
&s;ays, that
<Q>they only object to <HI>Lords Bi&s;hops</HI> being &s;ent over by Authority from the Legi&s;lature of Great Britain, with Power and Titles of worldly Pre-eminence.</Q>
And the Doctor in p. 104, &s;eems chiefly to fear, that the Bi&s;hops de&s;cribed in our Plan, &s;hould come <HI>from the King or State</HI>; for he is there very willing that we &s;hould have them from the Bohemians, or
<PB N="17" REF="012007_0024_0F8940EC163E88C8">
Walden&s;es, or Moravians, or even from Canada. But it can be a Matter of no Con&s;equence to tho&s;e, over whom they are to exerci&s;e no Juri&s;diction, whether our Bi&s;hops, under the Limitations propo|&s;ed, are of Bohemian, Moravian, or Engli&s;h Extraction. Bi&s;hops may be &s;ent by "the Legi&s;|lature of Great-Britain" without any temporal Power; and &s;uch only have been de&s;ired for Ame|rica. As to their <HI>Titles,</HI> which may give Pain to the envious and malicious, they will imply no <HI>Pre-eminence</HI> but what ari&s;es from the Nature of their Office, con&s;idered as <HI>purely</HI> eccle&s;ia&s;tical or <HI>&s;piritual,</HI> and will undoubtedly not exceed what were given to Bi&s;hops in the primitive Ages of the Church. "The Legi&s;lature of Great-Britain" has never been reque&s;ted to &s;end Bi&s;hops to America; nor is the Parliament de&s;ired to interfere any far|ther, than, if it &s;hould be found that the national E&s;tabli&s;hment will naturally give American Bi&s;hops, when appointed, more Authority than is propo&s;ed, to circum&s;cribe it according to our Plan.</P>
<P>AS to the KING indeed, it is the Duty both of the Clergy here, and of the Bi&s;hops at home, to apply to him for his Con&s;ent and Warrant, before they proceed to carry &s;uch a Scheme into Execution. This Duty ari&s;es from that <HI>Supremacy</HI> of the Crown, to which the Bi&s;hops and Clergy have &s;worn Sub|mi&s;&s;ion, in all &s;uch Ca&s;es, agreeably to the Laws of the Realm; and although we find
<Q>the Minds of &s;ome <HI>&s;landerous</HI> Folks to be offended</Q>

<P><PB N="18" REF="012007_0025_0F8940ECAE0FAFE0">AMONG the original Articles of the Doctor's Complaint, it was repre&s;ented, <HI>that the Arguments in Support of the</HI> PETITIONS <HI>for an American Epi&s;|copate had been kept &s;ecret; and that an authentic Knowledge of them, though applied for, was rejected.</HI> It was replied in the <HI>Appeal defended,</HI> 'I know no|thing of &s;uch an Application, or Rejection.' He now rejoins, p. 14, <HI>I am now di&s;po&s;ed to think he here wrote as he thought. But, if he had taken Time for Recollection, it is probable he would have called to Mind what he might not then have had in actual Remembrance. Did he never hear of a formal Ap|plication made by Dr. Stiles in a Letter to the Clerk of the New-York Convention, de&s;iring a Copy of their Petitions, e&s;pecially their Petition to the King, and of the formal Negative put upon this rea&s;onable Reque&s;t? Did he never hear of any Controver&s;y between the American Whig, and this Clerk of the Convention, relative to the Petition to the King, wherein he was called upon to put an End to the Di&s;pute, by producing the Words of the Petition, which he refu&s;ed to do?</HI> To all this I an&s;wer in the Negative. I neither heard of Dr. Stiles's Application, nor of the Di&s;pute between the <HI>American Whig</HI> and the Secretary of our Convention, till con&s;iderably <HI>after</HI> the Time of the Doctor's making his Complaint; and therefore I naturally &s;uppo&s;ed that what is here mentioned could not have occa&s;ioned it, it being not com|mon for <HI>Effects</HI> to go before their <HI>Cau&s;es.</HI> The Complaint was publi&s;hed by the Middle of March 1768, and mu&s;t have been printed in February, and written before it was printed&mdash;Mr. Seabury's Ad|verti&s;ement, as Secretary of the Convention, which brought on his Di&s;pute with the <HI>American Whig,</HI> did not make its Appearance in New-York before March 28&mdash;And Dr. Stiles's Application for Copies of
<PB N="19" REF="012007_0026_0F8940ED6D6B9428">
the Petitions, was not made till &s;everal Weeks af|terwards. So that the Reader &s;ees it was not owing to my Want of <HI>Recollection,</HI> but to my Ignorance of the Doctor's Abilities in <HI>Progno&s;tication,</HI> that I made &s;uch a Reply. But if this Gentleman was above making Di&s;tinctions between pa&s;t and future, he ought in Ju&s;tice to have told us &s;o, upon his engaging in the Controver&s;y.</P>
<P>IT was farther &s;aid in An&s;wer to him: 'The Complaint is altogether groundle&s;s; for the Plan upon which it was propo&s;ed that Bi&s;hops &s;hould be &s;ent to America, and the Arguments afterwards made U&s;e of in Support of the Petitions, actually were publi&s;hed, a con&s;iderable Time before the Petitions were &s;ent.' The Doctor replies, <HI>What is all this to the Purpo&s;e?</HI> p. 15. I mu&s;t confe&s;s it appears to me to be greatly to the Purpo&s;e, to &s;hew that particular Matters were publi&s;hed, in an&s;wering a Complaint that they were <HI>not</HI> publi&s;hed. <HI>It is true,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>&s;uch Arguments, in Support of the Plan for American Bi&s;hops as were thought fit to be pub|lickly u&s;ed, we have been</HI> (he might have &s;aid <HI>had been) made acquainted with. But the Que&s;tion is, are the&s;e the</HI> ONLY ONES <HI>that enforced the Petitions that were &s;ent home? Will the Doctor venture to &s;ay,</HI> NO OTHERS <HI>were u&s;ed?</HI> I a&s;&s;ure him, that &s;uch Arguments as had been publickly u&s;ed in Support of our Plan, included the ONLY ONES that were u&s;ed to enforce the Petitions; and therefore I need not add, that NO OTHERS were made U&s;e of for that Purpo&s;e. All this has been publickly a&s;&s;erted over and over. If &s;o, &s;ays the Doctor, <HI>What po&s;&s;ible Harm can there be in giving Copies of them?&mdash;It is generally &s;uppo&s;ed that &s;ome Things are &s;aid in Support of the&s;e Petitions, which the Clergy who &s;ent them
<PB N="20" REF="012007_0027_0F8940EE308660E8">
are not willing &s;hould be publickly known.</HI> No great Harm, I imagine, could have been expected from the Publication of our Petitions; and if the Clergy had been treated with Decency on the Occa&s;ion, it is not improbable that Copies of all of them would, long &s;ince, have been laid before the Public. But after having been openly bullied and abu&s;ed, upon no other Evidence again&s;t them than that of uncha|ritable Su&s;picions, and after the Petitions had been magi&s;terially demanded by anonymous Scriblers, they thought proper to refu&s;e them. In the&s;e Cir|cum&s;tances the Reque&s;t of Dr. <HI>Stiles,</HI> however <HI>rea&s;onable</HI> in it&s;elf, or however decently made, could not prudently be granted, as his Connecti|ons with a certain Party were known.</P>
<P>THE Doctor proceeds: <HI>If any Credit is due to the Word of a Gentleman, of well e&s;tabli&s;hed Repu|tation, who was favoured with a Sight, though not with a Copy of one of the&s;e Petitions, it contained that in it which has never been made public.</HI> I would not &s;ay any Thing to le&s;&s;en the <HI>well e&s;tabli&s;hed Re|putation</HI> of any Gentleman; but &s;uch an imperfect Te&s;timony can, by no Means, be admitted in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e. If the <HI>Gentleman,</HI> here meant, had the Sight of a <HI>true</HI> Copy, it is po&s;&s;ible that he may have mi&s;apprehended &s;ome particular Pa&s;&s;ages, or his Memory may have deceived him. But perhaps he &s;aw only the fir&s;t Draft of a Petition, before it had undergone the Corrections of the Convention; and from this he could form no Judgment of the Petition that was afterwards actually &s;ent. Perhaps he &s;aw a &s;purious Copy (and why may there not be fictitious Petitions, as well as <HI>fictitious Letters</HI> from Members of <HI>the Society?</HI>) written with a View, either of making Mi&s;chief among the Di&s;&s;enters,
<PB N="21" REF="012007_0028_0F8940EEEE994A70">
or of rai&s;ing an Odium again&s;t the epi&s;copal Cler|gy. To this mu&s;t be added, that the <HI>Gentleman</HI> him&s;elf is not known, and con&s;equently but little Regard can be paid to his Te&s;timony, at any Rate. Now, to borrow a little of the Doctor's Phra&s;eolo|gy from p. 168, this <HI>poor, lame, lank</HI> Evidence is all that he has to oppo&s;e to the po&s;itive and pe|remptory Declarations of our Convention to the contrary, and particularly by the Pen of their very worthy Secretary; the Members of which Con|vention mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to know what they them&s;elves did in the Affair, and can, whenever they plea&s;e, have Recour&s;e to the original Papers.</P>
<P>BUT as what could not prudently be done, at that Sea&s;on of epidemic Pre&s;byterian Vehemence again&s;t the Clergy and the Church of England in the Colonies, may not be altogether improper now&mdash;when the Pa&s;&s;ions of Men have greatly &s;ub|&s;ided, and their Prejudices have abated, in Pro|portion as their Eyes have been opened; in order to gratify the Curio&s;ity of the Reader (not forget|ting Dr. <HI>Chauncy</HI>) I will lay before him <HI>true</HI> Co|pies of our Petitions to the King, and the Arch|bi&s;hop of Canterbury, without any Comment or Explanation: And if our late Adver&s;aries &s;hould continue to pre&s;erve their pre&s;ent apparent good Temper, (here I do not forget, but mu&s;t except, the Doctor) the other Petitions may po&s;&s;ibly &s;ee the Light on &s;ome future Occa&s;ions.</P>

<P>THE Clergy of New-York and New-Jer&s;ey, after mature Con&s;ideration, have thought proper to addre&s;s the Throne, in Behalf of the Church of England in A|merica, which, while de&s;titute of Bi&s;hops and an orderly Di&s;cipline, mu&s;t be in a ruinous
<PB N="24" REF="012007_0031_0F8940F12E9581B0">
Condition, have taken the Liberty to enclo&s;e their Addre&s;s, to your Grace, humbly reque&s;t|ing, that, to the innumerable kind Offices which you have been doing to the American Church and Clergy for a long Cour&s;e of Years, You will be plea&s;ed to add that of pre&s;enting it to his Maje&s;ty, and of &s;upporting the Prayer of it with tho&s;e Arguments and Repre&s;entations, which none can u&s;e &s;o properly or to &s;o great Advantage, as your Grace. It is impo&s;&s;ible that this Cau&s;e can be better pleaded than it was by your Grace many Years ago in a public Manner, and no one has ever yet done it &s;o well; and if any Relief is to be obtained, we have Rea&s;on to expect it from &s;uch a Prince as now adorns the Throne, by the Mediation of &s;uch an Advocate.</P>
<P>IT is needle&s;s to be particular with your Grace, who are &s;o thoroughly acquainted with our Ca&s;e and Condition; and it would be injurious to offer Intreaties to &s;o warm and avowed a Pa|tron. The Reque&s;t, we apprehend, is &s;o rea|&s;onable and equitable, that none can oppo&s;e it with any Appearance of Ju&s;tice or Humanity; and the Plan of an American Epi&s;copate, as it has been often explained by your Grace, is &s;o univer&s;ally harmle&s;s and unexceptionable, that no tolerable Objections can be offered again&s;t it.</P>
<P>However we are &s;en&s;ible that a powerful Con|federacy has been formed to oppo&s;e it, which will probably continue; in which Ca&s;e the great Que&s;tion is, in our humble Opinion, Whether the Church here &s;hall be &s;acrificed to the Per|ver&s;ene&s;s and malicious Ob&s;tinacy of its Ene|mies, or, whether its Friends &s;hall run the
<PB N="25" REF="012007_0032_0F8940F1EE9F5938">
Hazard of di&s;obliging them? We do not pre|tend to &s;ee far into Futurity, but we are &s;adly apprehen&s;ive, that if our Enemies have now Power to prevent our having Bi&s;hops in Ame|rica, the Time is not far di&s;tant, when, having gathered Strength by Conce&s;&s;ions, they will be al&s;o able to exterminate Epi&s;copacy even in England.</P>
<P>AMONGST other Arts that have been u&s;ed to di&s;appoint us, it has been publickly and boldly a&s;&s;erted<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">IN many of the Engli&s;h and American News-Papers.</NOTE>,
<Q><HI>that the &s;ending us Bi&s;hops is ut|terly di&s;agreeable to nineteen Twentieths of all the People in America, and would occa&s;ion a more dangerous Di&s;content and Clamour than the</HI> Stamp-Duty, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q>
This, we beg Leave to a&s;&s;ure your Grace, is a Slander, vile and malicious in all its Parts. We do not believe <HI>any</HI> Per|&s;ons in the&s;e Colonies have ever pretended &s;o much Unea&s;ine&s;s at the Pro&s;pect of Bi&s;hops, as has been <HI>generally</HI> expre&s;&s;ed on Occa&s;ion of the Stamp-Act. Indeed we have heard of no Cla|mour at all, and our Ears have been open. We have made it our Bu&s;ine&s;s for &s;ome Time pa&s;t to mention the Affair to the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Di&s;|&s;enters among us, as Opportunity has fairly of|fered, but we have found none that pretend to di&s;pute the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of it. On the other Hand, &s;everal have declared that they have no Objections to Bi&s;hops in America, provided the Di&s;&s;enters are not to come under their Juri&s;dic|tion. There is no Doubt but tho&s;e who are the Enemies of the Church would be &s;orry to &s;ee it in a flouri&s;hing State, but none are &s;o hardy as to tell us &s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="012007_0033_0F8940F2ADBAAA40">
AND as to the Proportion of di&s;&s;atisfied Peo|ple, who are repre&s;ented to be Nineteen in Twenty, it is too glaringly fal&s;e to de&s;erve an An&s;wer. If we take into the Account all the North-American Colonies, and it is not fair to do otherwi&s;e, we believe that of the Profe&s;&s;ors of the Church of England the Number is as great, (&s;ome &s;ay &s;uperior) as that of the Di&s;&s;en|ters. There are al&s;o many Thou&s;ands of Lu|therans in the Colonies, who&s;e good Wi&s;hes in this Ca&s;e we may &s;afely rely on. And of the Di&s;&s;enters, a con&s;iderable Proportion are Qua|kers, who are well known to have generally a much better Opinion of the Church, than of the Pre&s;byterians. Nay, they now begin to dread the increa&s;ing Power of the latter in this Coun|try, and declare their Re&s;olution to &s;upport the Church; and of late there have been &s;everal In&s;tances of their contributing largely to the building of Churches, on the &s;ame Principle.</P>
<P>AFTER all, &s;uppo&s;ing the Di&s;content were really con&s;iderable, yet the World mu&s;t pro|nounce that it is very unrea&s;onable. And we tru&s;t that our Superiors, who believe Epi&s;co|pacy to be the Appointment of Chri&s;t, will al|ways think it more rea&s;onable, and, upon the whole, more prudent and better Policy, to obey God and to oblige the Friends of the Church, than to plea&s;e a comparatively &s;mall and unrea|&s;onable Party. But if we are to have no Bi&s;hops until the Di&s;&s;enters are willing, we know what to expect: We &s;hall only &s;ay, that the Ca&s;e ap|pears to us to be unparalleled in this, as well as other Re&s;pects.</P>

YOUR Grace will excu&s;e the Warmth of this Addre&s;s, as it proceeds from no intere&s;ted Views, but from a Sen&s;e we are under of the Nece&s;&s;ities of the Church. We &s;hall offer no farther Apo|logy, but relying on your great Goodne&s;s, beg Leave to &s;ub&s;cribe our&s;elves, as we are with the utmo&s;t Veneration and Gratitude, &amp;c.</P>

<P>HAVING gone through the Doctor's preliminary Articles, I &s;hall now proceed to con&s;ider the Sub|&s;tance of his fir&s;t Section, amounting to a third Part of his Pamphlet; although there is but little in it that is immediately connected with the Epi&s;co|pate in Que&s;tion. And here, upon a Pro&s;pect of the Work before me, I am ready to &s;hrink back, and to repent that I have undertaken it. Were the Bu|&s;ine&s;s only to debate Matters of &s;ome Con&s;equence with a candid Opponent, I &s;hould enter upon it with le&s;s Reluctance, and could promi&s;e the Reader more Satisfaction. But where much Time and Labour mu&s;t be &s;pent in the unprofitable Drud|gery of comparing Pamphlet with Pamphlet, of balancing Sentence with Sentence, of &s;hewing that I &s;aid <HI>&s;o,</HI> or &s;aid <HI>not</HI> &s;o&mdash;that the Doctor &s;aid this, or meant that, or mi&s;took, or mi&s;repre&s;ented the Matter, I fear it will be a Trial indeed. And yet to more than a little of this Kind of Labour am I unavoidably de&s;tined, in the pre&s;ent Undertaking.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>Appeal defended,</HI> I regreted that I had in|troduced the Plea for American Bi&s;hops, with a <HI>Sketch</HI> of the general Arguments in Favour of E|pi&s;copacy; and confe&s;&s;ed
<Q>that what was &s;aid on the general Subject, however ju&s;t in it&s;elf, or proper in Theory, had been better omited</Q>
&mdash;for
<PB N="28" REF="012007_0035_0F8940F516486FF0">
Rea&s;ons that need not be repeated. <HI>And yet,</HI> &s;ays the Doctor, <HI>he has wrote</HI> [written] <HI>not le&s;s than</HI> 98 <HI>Pages&mdash;more than one third Part of the whole&mdash;in Support of that, concerning which he was convinced it had been better if he had &s;aid nothing.</HI> p. 17. But in the 98 Pages, to which he refers, I &s;aid but little upon what was contained in the <HI>Sketch,</HI> and carefully avoided &s;aying any Thing on the Evi|dence of Scripture and the primitive Church, which is the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential Part of the general Controver&s;y; becau&s;e I was for ha&s;tening to the Subject of an American Epi&s;copate. And that I reached it no &s;ooner, was owing to the Doctor's needle&s;sly ob&s;tructing my Pa&s;&s;age with, what he pretended to be, the Sentiments of our fir&s;t Re|formers, the Opinions of &s;ome eminent Moderns, the Ca&s;e of the Walden&s;es, of the foreign Churches, the King's Supremacy, &amp;c. The&s;e were the Sub|jects of tho&s;e 98 Pages, and not the <HI>Jus divinum</HI> of Epi&s;copacy, which was <HI>that, concerning which I was convinced it had been better if I had &s;aid nothing.</HI> And yet a Subject that had been better omited in the <HI>Appeal,</HI> might very properly come under Con|&s;ideration in the <HI>Appeal defended,</HI> as it was profe&s;|&s;edly written
<Q>in <HI>An&s;wer</HI> to the <HI>Objections and Mi&s;|repre&s;entations</HI> of Dr. Chauncy and others.</Q>
This I take to be a &s;ufficient Reply to all that is &s;aid in three prevaricating Pages, wherein the Doctor far|ther exerci&s;es his Talents, and labours to prove me to have been guilty, not only of what he calls <HI>in|judicious Unfairne&s;s</HI> (he may po&s;&s;ibly think his OWN <HI>Unfairne&s;s</HI> to have been <HI>judicious</HI>) but al&s;o of <HI>In|con&s;i&s;tency.</HI></P>
<P>IN the <HI>Appeal,</HI> the divine Right of Epi&s;copacy was a&s;&s;erted. The Doctor denied this to be a Doc|trine
<PB N="29" REF="012007_0036_0F8940F5B029D968">
of the Church of England. It was replied, in the fir&s;t Place, that were this really the Ca&s;e, and
<Q>if it be by Virtue only of the <HI>Jus humanum</HI> of Epi&s;copacy that Bi&s;hops are nece&s;&s;ary, &s;till the Ends for which they are nece&s;&s;ary cannot be ob|tained without them, &s;o long as we are &s;ubject to the Authority that requires them.</Q>
He now rejoins: <HI>As the Authority requiring is by Suppo&s;ition merely human, no Complaints can rea&s;onably be made by tho&s;e who could have none to make, if they ac|knowledged and honoured no one but Je&s;us Chri&s;t as &s;upreme Head of the Chri&s;tian Church.</HI> p. 20. But does not the Doctor know that none admit of a <HI>&s;upreme Head of the Chri&s;tian Church</HI> upon Earth, but Papi&s;ts? I hope he did not mean to in&s;inuate, that the epi&s;copal Clergy in the Colonies believe the Doctrine of the Pope's Supremacy. The &s;u|preme Head of a <HI>national</HI> Church is a very differ|ent Thing from the &s;upreme Head of <HI>the Chri&s;tian</HI> Church; and, by the former, the Church of En|gland means no more than the Prerogative given to our Princes, of
<Q>ruling all E&s;tates and Degrees commited to their Charge by God, whether they be <HI>eccle&s;ia&s;tical</HI> or temporal<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Article</HI> XXXVII.</NOTE>,</Q>
in Oppo&s;ition to the Pope's U&s;urpation: And, whether this is in|con&s;i&s;tent with Chri&s;t's <HI>ab&s;olute Supremacy,</HI> let com|mon Sen&s;e judge. An Authority to govern the na|tional Church in <HI>Subordination</HI> to Chri&s;t, is the mo&s;t that the Church of England ever a&s;cribed to Chri&s;tian Princes; and the Claim of <HI>&s;ubordinate</HI> Authority is &s;o far from denying, that it actually acknowledges and e&s;tabli&s;hes, the Supremacy of the <HI>Principal.</HI> But more will be &s;aid upon this Subject in its proper Place. Suppo&s;ing now, but not granting, that we e&s;teemed Bi&s;hops to be ne|ce&s;&s;ary
<PB N="30" REF="012007_0037_0F8940F66F2CFEF0">
by Virtue only of a <HI>Jus Humanum</HI>; it is evident, at fir&s;t View, that the Ends for which they are thus made nece&s;&s;ary cannot be obtained with|out them,
<Q>&s;o long as we are &s;ubject to the Au|thority that requires them,</Q>
and
<Q>look upon our|&s;elves to be bound in Duty and Con&s;cience to obey</Q>
it. And the Ca&s;e of Epi&s;copalians in A|merica, con&s;cientiou&s;ly obedient to the national Authority, mu&s;t be hard without an Epi&s;copate, in Proportion to the Nece&s;&s;ity or Importance of tho&s;e Ends, for which Bi&s;hops are nece&s;&s;ary. To tell us that we are wrong in our Notions of the King's Supremacy, if true, would be nothing to the Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>IT was farther &s;aid in Reply, that, with Regard to Epi&s;copacy, the Doctor mi&s;took the Principles of the Church of England, which always acknow|ledged a divine Right.

but he choo&s;es to an&s;wer <HI>in the Language of two famous epi&s;copal Writers.</HI> What then do the&s;e two famous Writers &s;ay? The fir&s;t is Bi&s;hop Hoadly, in his <HI>Rea&s;onablene&s;s of Conformity,</HI> writ|ten with the laudable View of reconciling the Non|conformi&s;ts to the Church of England. In the Cour&s;e of his Work, he repre&s;ented the Difference that divided them from the Conformi&s;ts to be, in Reality, much &s;maller, in many In&s;tances, than had been commonly pretended. Dr. Calamy had offered, as an Objection again&s;t mini&s;terial Con|formity, that the Sub&s;cription required from the Clergy, implies
<Q>an Allowance and Approbation of that A&s;&s;ertion, that Bi&s;hops, Prie&s;ts and Deacons are three di&s;tinct Orders <HI>by divine Ap|pointment.</HI></Q>
Mr. Hoadly an&s;wered, that this Quotation from the Preface to the Ordinal was not fairly made.
<Q><HI>By divine Appointment,</HI> &s;ays he, You add your&s;elves;</Q>
which was certainly true, the&s;e Words being not in the Preface.
<Q>For, continues he, all that the Sentence, which you quote, &s;ays, is that <HI>that the&s;e Orders have been in the Church from the Apo&s;tles Times.</HI></Q>
He then proceeds in the Words cited by the Doctor, the Force of which is contained in this one A&s;&s;ertion:
<Q><HI>There is &s;ome Difference between the two Sen|tences,</HI> Bi&s;hops, Prie&s;ts and Deacons, are three di&s;tinct Orders in the Church by <HI>DIVINE APPOINT|MENT, and,</HI>&mdash;From the Apo&s;tles Times, there have been the&s;e Orders in Chri&s;t's Church, Bi&s;hops, Prie&s;ts and Deacons:</Q>
Which Di&s;tinction is un|doubtedly ju&s;t, when the Di&s;pute is about the Words of the Ordinal. But he does not deny that the Preface a&s;&s;erts the <HI>Di&s;tinction</HI> of the three Orders&mdash;nor that it deduces the <HI>Antiquity</HI> of this Di&s;tinction from the Time of the Apo&s;tles&mdash;nor
<PB N="32" REF="012007_0039_0F8940F7EE82C4D0">
that it &s;ays the EVIDENCE of it is contained in holy Scripture and ancient Authors&mdash;nor that it main|tains the <HI>Clearne&s;s</HI> of this Evidence to all diligent Inquirers; which is all that I affirmed, or am obli|ged to &s;upport. Nor does it appear in his Di&s;pute with Dr. Calamy, that he him&s;elf did not fully be|lieve the apo&s;tolical In&s;titution of Epi&s;copacy. But on the contrary, in this &s;ame Book, which the Doctor has the A&s;&s;urance to quote, he expre&s;sly declares:
<Q>We think we can <HI>demon&s;trate</HI> that in the primitive Times the Admini&s;tration of ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical Affairs was in the Hands of <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> who had <HI>Pre&s;byters</HI> &s;ubject to them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Second</HI> Edition, p. 4.</NOTE>.</Q>
And a|gain:
<Q>Imagining our Method (of Ordination by Bi&s;hops) to be the orderly and &s;ettled Method <HI>from the primitive Ages</HI>; where we &s;ee it neg|lected, when there is no Nece&s;&s;ity, we think in Ju&s;tice, <HI>we cannot acknowledge tho&s;e who depart from it approved of God,</HI> in &s;etting apart them|&s;elves for the Mini&s;try<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ibid.</HI> p. 8.</NOTE>.</Q>
This approaches near|ly to the mo&s;t <HI>high-flying</HI> Expre&s;&s;ions u&s;ed in the <HI>Appeal</HI>; in which the Author went not much far|ther than this eminent Writer, who&s;e Moderation has been known and celebrated throughout the Chri&s;tian World. In his <HI>Defence of epi&s;copal Ordi|nation,</HI> he undertakes to prove, and does prove, that it is of APOSTOLICAL INSTITUTION. And he introduces Mr. Baxter him&s;elf, as making this very important Conce&s;&s;ion:
<Q>that there were fixed Bi|&s;hops in &s;ome Churches in the Days of one of the Apo&s;tles; that neither the Apo&s;tles, nor any of their Di&s;ciples, nor any Chri&s;tian, or Here|tic in the World, &s;pake, or wrote a Word a|gain&s;t Epi&s;copacy, till long after it was generally &s;ettled in the Churches.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="012007_0040_0F8940F8ADBE4038">THE other <HI>famous epi&s;copal Writer,</HI> in who&s;e Words the Doctor choo&s;es to expre&s;s him&s;elf, is Mr. Olly&s;&s;e, in his An&s;wer to the &s;ame Dr. Calamy. After making the &s;ame Di&s;tinction with Mr. Hoadly about the Words of the Preface to the Ordinal, he &s;ays, as quoted by the Doctor, that the Preface "does not prove a <HI>divine Appointment.</HI>" That Pre|face does not undertake to <HI>prove</HI> any Thing. It was drawn up as an explicit Declaration of the Doctrine of the Church of England, relating to the three eccle&s;ia&s;tical Orders which were e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, and it &s;ays the Evidence in Favour of this Form of Church-Government is contained <HI>in Scrip|ture,</HI> as well as <HI>in ancient Authors.</HI> This <HI>looks</HI> &s;ome|what <HI>like</HI> an Acknowledgment of a <HI>divine Ap|pointment.</HI> But not to in&s;i&s;t upon this. No farther Evidence is required to prove that Epi&s;copacy is of <HI>divine Appointment,</HI> than that it is of <HI>apo&s;tolical</HI> Appointment. The Apo&s;tles were <HI>in&s;pired</HI> Men, and peculiarly conducted by the Spirit of God in the public Execution of their Office; and for the &s;ame Rea&s;ons that their <HI>Writings</HI> are of divine Authority, the <HI>eccle&s;ia&s;tical Government</HI> they &s;ettled, as to all its e&s;&s;ential Parts, mu&s;t be of divine Au|thority. But that Epi&s;copacy was of <HI>apo&s;tolical Ap|pointment,</HI> Bi&s;hop Hoadly thought he could <HI>de|mon&s;trate,</HI> and Chillingworth <HI>did</HI> demon&s;trate, even from the Conce&s;&s;ions of its Enemies: And Epi&s;|copacy differs <HI>as e&s;&s;entially</HI> from Pre&s;byteriani&s;m or Congregationali&s;m or Independency, as Monarchy does from Ari&s;tocracy or Democracy.</P>
<P>BUT, &s;ays Mr. Olly&s;&s;e, as the Doctor quotes him, there were
<Q>other Things, in the Apo&s;tles Days, which yet for all that are not allowed to be of <HI>divine Appointment.</HI></Q>
This is not accu|rately
<PB N="34" REF="012007_0041_0F8940F96EAEAF00">
expre&s;&s;ed; but I take the Author's Meaning to be, that the Apo&s;tles injoined and practiced &s;ome Things, that are generally allowed not to have, at this Day, the Authority of a divine Appointment. This may be true: But if we may judge of others by St. Paul, whenever they gave Directions relat|ing to the Church that were occa&s;ional or local, and not of general and perpetual Obligation to prevent Mi&s;takes, they were careful to &s;ignify it. This, we know, in particular, was the Practice of the great "Apo&s;tle of the Gentiles;" who found|ed more Churches, and i&s;&s;ued out more eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal Injunctions, than any other Apo&s;tle. And as to Authority to govern the Church, and to ordain, it mu&s;t, in the Nature of Things, have continued in tho&s;e Hands wherein it was originally placed, and in the Hands of &s;uch Succe&s;&s;ors, from Time to Time, as it was regularly conveyed to. There is not the lea&s;t Intimation in Scripture that the ori|ginal Form of it might be changed; nor is there any Appearance that the primitive Church thought it could be changed.</P>
<P>THE Doctor informs us (in a <HI>Note,</HI> p. 21) that, <HI>after long &s;eeking,</HI> he was &s;o lucky as to obtain <HI>a Sight of the</HI> OLD <HI>Ordinal. The Year in which it was printed is not mentioned,</HI> but he looks upon it to be <HI>one of the fir&s;t printed Copies, or a Reprint from one of the&s;e,</HI> in the Reign of EDWARD VI. The Rea|&s;ons a&s;&s;igned for his Belief of its Antiquity are, that <HI>it is printed in the Old Engli&s;h Letter,</HI> and that he finds at the Bottom of the Title-Page,
<Q>Lon|don, printed by <HI>R. Barker</HI> and <HI>J. Bill,</HI> Printers to the King's mo&s;t excellent Maje&s;ty.</Q>
This, I believe, will not procure him an Election into <HI>the Society of Antiquarians:</HI> For to &s;ay nothing of
<PB N="35" REF="012007_0042_0F8940FA2DE74438">
<HI>the Old Engli&s;h Letter,</HI> which on &s;ome Occa&s;ions is u&s;ed to this very Day, <HI>Barker</HI> and <HI>Bill</HI> were Prin|ters to CHARLES I, almo&s;t 100 Years after the <HI>old Ordinal</HI> was <HI>fir&s;t printed.</HI> But this is a Matter of no Con&s;equence, if they did but give a faithful <HI>Reprint</HI> from a true Copy. Well: Upon comparing the <HI>Preface</HI> as it there &s;tands, with that which is <HI>now</HI> prefixed to our Ordination-Offices, he finds that it underwent <HI>a very material Alteration</HI> in the Time of CHARLES II. He points out the Variations; but they appear to be of little Con&s;equence, as nothing is expre&s;&s;ed in the latter, which is not &s;trongly im|plied in the former, and which was not as clearly expre&s;&s;ed both in the Engli&s;h and Latin Articles of 1552, and of 1562.</P>
<P>BUT he urges, that although none under the pre|&s;ent Ordinal <HI>may be looked upon as a lawful Mini&s;ter</HI> without <HI>epi&s;copal Ordination, it does not appear that this was the Ca&s;e under the old</HI>&mdash;and that the <HI>Re|viewers</HI> afterwards <HI>did not think this an indi&s;putable Point; otherwi&s;e they would not have made an Alter|ation, the principal De&s;ign of which was to put this Matter beyond all Doubt.</HI> I am glad to find that he allows it to be the De&s;ign of the Preface to the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> Ordinal, to put this Matter beyond all Doubt: For hereby he admits that the Church of England ever &s;ince the <HI>Re&s;toration</HI> has maintained the apo&s;tolical In&s;titution of Epi&s;copacy, contrary to his frequent A&s;&s;ertions. Nor has he been able to prove that <HI>before</HI> the <HI>Re&s;toration</HI> &s;he held other|wi&s;e. But why then was &s;uch an Alteration made, if the Point was already &s;ecured? A <HI>famous epi&s;co|pal Writer,</HI> who&s;e Words, the Doctor knows, it may &s;ometimes be prudent to u&s;e, in&s;tead of one's own, will help us to a proper An&s;wer to this Que|&s;tion.

<P>IN another <HI>Note,</HI> p. 24, (for I mu&s;t pick up Mat|ters in the Order wherein I find them) he tells us, that <HI>the upper Hou&s;e of Convocation, no longer</HI> [ago] <HI>than</HI> [in] 1702, <HI>appear to have been of Opinion, that Epi&s;copacy, upon the Footing of</HI> DIVINE APOSTOLICAL INSTITUTION, <HI>was not the Doctrine of the Church of England, notwith&s;tanding all that is &s;aid in the Preface to the Ordinal.</HI> For this he brings no other
<PB N="37" REF="012007_0044_0F8940FBAEF18078">
Proof, than what Dr. Calamy repre&s;ents to have pa&s;&s;ed in an Altercation between the two Hou&s;es of Convocation; wherein, the lower Hou&s;e, repre|&s;enting that <HI>they had been</HI> SCANDALOUSLY <HI>repre&s;ented,</HI> by the upper Hou&s;e, <HI>as Favourers of Pre&s;bytery, in Oppo&s;ition to Epi&s;copacy,</HI> make a formal Declaration, <HI>that they acknowledged the Order of Bi&s;hops, as &s;upe|rior to Pre&s;byters,</HI> to be of DIVINE APOSTOLICAL INSTITUTION; and afterwards complain, that, on this Account, <HI>they were accu&s;ed of a&s;cribing</HI> TOO MUCH to Epi&s;copacy.

Yet were the Ca&s;e exactly as it is here repre&s;ented, we know that Words, u&s;ed in the Warmth of Pa&s;&s;ion, are no Proof of the real Sen|timents of tho&s;e that utter them. I hope every Expre&s;&s;ion that has e&s;caped the Doctor, during the Heat of the pre&s;ent Controver&s;y is not to be con|&s;idered as an Evidence of his real Opinion.</P>
<P>AS he advances in the Di&s;pute, he waxes &s;touter and more vigorous in his Oppo&s;ition to Epi&s;copacy. For, in p. 26, he has the Courage to affirm, that <HI>the Book of Ordination, the Preface to which we have been con&s;idering, is formed upon the Suppo&s;ition, that Pre&s;byters have the Power of Ordination in common with Bi&s;hops; nor can it in any other View be made con&s;i&s;tent with it&s;elf.</HI> To this I will reply, in the Words of the celebrated <HI>Hooker</HI>:
<Q>With us,

even at this Day, Pre&s;byters are licen&s;ed to do as much as that Council (the 4th of Carthage) &s;peaketh of, if any be pre&s;ent.

The A&s;&s;ociation of Pre&s;byters is no &s;ufficient Proof that the Power of Ordination is in them; but rather, that it <HI>never was</HI> in them we may here|by under&s;tand; for that no Man is able to &s;hew either Deacon or Pre&s;byter ordained by Pre&s;byters only, and his Ordination accounted lawful in any ancient Part of the Church <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Polity,</HI> Lib. vii. Cap. vi.</NOTE>.</Q> This may &s;erve, at pre&s;ent, as a general An&s;wer to the Doctor's general A&s;&s;ertion. But we &s;hall &s;oon come to Particulars. For he intends to <HI>dilate upon the Matter,</HI> as it is a Thing that has not been <HI>com|monly con&s;idered,</HI> by <HI>giving a large Extract from Mr. Ferdinand Shaw's</HI>
<Q>Judgment of the Church of England.</Q>
He <HI>chu&s;es to exhibit this Extract</HI> the rather, <HI>becau&s;e it is taken from a Pamphlet</HI> he <HI>lately received from the other Side</HI> [of] <HI>the Atlantic, and</HI> [which] <HI>is, perhaps the</HI> ONLY ONE <HI>in America</HI>; meaning the only Copy of <HI>that</HI> Pamphlet, for &s;ure|ly he mu&s;t know that there are other <HI>Pamphlets</HI> in America.</P>
<P>BUT previou&s;ly to this <HI>Dilatation,</HI> in An&s;wer to my de&s;iring him to try the Experiment, whether he could 'hone&s;tly and con&s;i&s;tently' declare his own Sentiments, concerning Epi&s;copacy, in the Words of the Preface to the Ordinal, he &s;ays that he <HI>has</HI> tried it, <HI>and finds that he can; i. e.</HI> as we are to under&s;tand him, <HI>with the Allowance only of</HI> 'Explanations' <HI>more natural, and</HI> 'Interpretations' <HI>le&s;s &s;oftening than Ninety-Nine in a Hundred</HI> (mean|ing,

The Ju&s;tice and Propriety, are equal to the Charity, of this Reflection. It is no Proof that he can &s;ub&s;cribe to the Words of the <HI>Preface</HI> 'hone&s;tly and con&s;i&s;t|ently,' that he can do &s;o with <HI>le&s;s</HI> Prevarication than is practiced by many others, on certain Oc|ca&s;ions. Nor do Ninety-Nine in a Hundred pre|varicate, in &s;ub&s;cribing to the Articles of the Church: So far from it, that none, whom he means to a&s;per&s;e, have Occa&s;ion to prevaricate at all. The Church of England is not, nor was it ever, founded upon <HI>Calvini&s;tical</HI> Principles, as its Enemies take Plea&s;ure in a&s;&s;erting:&mdash;Unle&s;s <HI>Cal|vini&s;m</HI> admits, of a Po&s;&s;ibility of falling from Grace, as in <HI>Art.</HI> xvi&mdash;of conditional Promi&s;es, as in <HI>Art.</HI> xvii&mdash;and of univer&s;al Redemption by Chri&s;t, as in <HI>Art.</HI> xxxi.

<P>I COME now to attend upon Mr. Ferdinand Shaw. He affirms that in the old Ordinal, <HI>the Form of committing to Bi&s;hops and Pre&s;byters their Office and Work, made no Di&s;tinction at all in the Order,</HI> to which they were admitted. And again: <HI>What|ever
<PB N="40" REF="012007_0047_0F8940FF182F21B0">
&s;piritual Powers the one had given them, to the other were given the &s;ame. Had Bi&s;hops the Power of Ordination committed to them, &s;o had Pre&s;byters too, who received the &s;ame Commi&s;&s;ion, by the &s;ame Solemnity, in Words of the &s;ame Importance, and therefore mu&s;t be inve&s;ted with the &s;ame divine Of|fice.</HI> Such an A&s;&s;ertion mu&s;t be amazing, to any one that has &s;een the old Ordinal, or that has any Acquaintance with our eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;tory. This indeed was objected by the Papi&s;ts, in the Reign of CHARLES II, which, together with other fal&s;e and groundle&s;s A&s;&s;ertions, occa&s;ioned Bi&s;hop Bur|net, then a private Clergyman, to write his <HI>Vindi|cation of the Ordinations of the Church of England.</HI> The popi&s;h Writers, e&s;pecially &s;uch of them as are &s;ingled out for Di&s;putants, have a Way of their own, and profe&s;&s;edly make no Con&s;cience of &s;ay|ing any Thing that has a Tendency to advance their Cau&s;e. But Mr. Shaw, I hope, is a Prote&s;|tant; and Prote&s;tants have no Right, contrary to their Profe&s;&s;ion and Principles, to practice this Art. However, a brief Examination of what is here advanced, may be expected by the Reader.</P>
<P>IF by <HI>the Form of committing to Bi&s;hops and Pre&s;byters their Office and Work,</HI> this Writer means the <HI>Offices</HI> u&s;ed at their re&s;pective Ordinations, he gro&s;sly mi&s;repre&s;ents them. For the Titles of the two Offices, the Offices them&s;elves in almo&s;t all their Parts, and the whole Face and Appearance of them, are widely different; and they clearly point out and di&s;tingui&s;h a Difference of <HI>Order.</HI> In the Prayer to be u&s;ed at the End of the Lita|ny, at the Ordination of Prie&s;ts, God is &s;aid to have
<Q>appointed divers (<HI>i. e.</HI> more than Two) <HI>Orders</HI> of Mini&s;ters in the Church.</Q>
How many,
<PB N="41" REF="012007_0048_0F8940FF6DE60BB8">
and what, the&s;e <HI>divers Orders</HI> are, is declared in the general Preface. When a Per&s;on pre&s;ents him|&s;elf for Ordination according to the Form of the &s;econd Office, he knows that he can be made by it no more than a Pre&s;byter. He is a&s;ked:
<Q>Will you reverently <HI>obey your Ordinary,</HI> and other <HI>chief Mini&s;ters</HI> unto whom the <HI>Government and Charge is committed over you,</HI> following with a glad Mind and Will their godly Admonitions, and <HI>&s;ubmitting</HI> your&s;elf to their godly <HI>Judg|ments?</HI></Q>
And he an&s;wers:
<Q>I will do &s;o, the Lord being my Helper.</Q>
And although the Word <HI>Order,</HI> as it now &s;tands in the new Ordinal, is not al|ways to be found in the corre&s;ponding Places of the old; yet it is a Matter of no Con&s;equence, as other Words, &s;uch as <HI>Mini&s;try</HI> and <HI>Office,</HI> are u&s;ed in an equivalent Sen&s;e. Thus, when the Archdeacon &s;ays to the Bi&s;hop,
<Q>I pre&s;ent unto you the&s;e Per&s;ons pre&s;ent to be admitted to the <HI>Order</HI> of Prie&s;t|hood,</Q>
the Bi&s;hop, immediately addre&s;&s;ing the People, &s;ays:
<Q>the&s;e be they whom we purpo&s;e, God willing, to receive this Day into the holy <HI>Of|fice</HI> of Prie&s;thood;</Q>
and before the Sentence is concluded, he calls it the "holy Mini&s;try," and, in another Place, "the Mini&s;try of the Prie&s;thood."</P>
<P>IF it be the Meaning of this Writer, that tho&s;e particular Words in the Office, by which the Au|thority is more immediately conveyed, make <HI>no Di&s;tinction in the Order,</HI> it is al&s;o a Mi&s;repre&s;enta|tion. A Di&s;tinction actually is made, and as much as is nece&s;&s;ary, even on the Principles of the &s;trict|e&s;t Epi&s;copalians. The Words at the Ordination of Prie&s;ts are;
<Q>Receive the holy Gho&s;t: Who&s;e Sins thou do&s;t forgive, they are forgiven: And be thou a faithful Di&s;pen&s;er of the Word of

The Bi&s;hop, then delivering a Bible, &s;ays:
<Q>Take thou Authority to preach the Word of God, and to admini&s;ter the holy Sacraments in this Congregation, where thou &s;halt be <HI>ap|pointed.</HI></Q>
But in the Ordination of a Bi&s;hop, the Words are the&s;e:
<Q>Take the Holy Gho&s;t: And remember thou &s;tir up the Grace of God which is in thee, by Impo&s;ition of Hands; for God hath not given us the Spirit of Fear, but of Power, and Love and Soberne&s;s.</Q>
Then de|livering to him the Bible, the Archbi&s;hop charges him
<Q>Give Heed unto Reading, &amp;c. Be to the Flock of Chri&s;t a <HI>Shepherd,</HI> not a Wolf: Feed them, devour them not; hold up the weak, heal the &s;ick, bind together the broken, bring again the outca&s;ts, &s;eek the lo&s;t; be &s;o merciful that you be not too remi&s;s: So mini&s;ter Di&s;cip|line, that you forget not Mercy, that when the Shepherd &s;hall come, you may receive the im|marce&s;&s;ible Crown of Glory, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord.</Q>
Who does not here &s;ee a very wide and material Difference? The Words,
<Q>receive, or take, the Holy Gho&s;t,</Q>
are indeed the &s;ame in both Offices; they are general, and make no Di&s;tinction. But in the Ordination of Pre&s;byters, a Di&s;tinction, of their Office from that of Bi&s;hops, immediately follows. They are declared to have, and the Declaration implies that they only have, in Virtue of that Ordination, the Power of ab|&s;olving Penitents, and of di&s;pen&s;ing the Word and Sacraments, and that in &s;uch Congregations only as they &s;hould be appointed to. Here is not the lea&s;t Appearance of epi&s;copal Powers, nor of any Authority which is not at this Day given, by the Church of England, to Pre&s;byters. But in the
<PB N="43" REF="012007_0050_0F894100EDB20368">
Ordination of Bi&s;hops, there is none of this Re|&s;traint; the Words are left general, as they were u&s;ed by Chri&s;t in ordaining his Apo&s;tles; and all the ordinary Authority, which they were original|ly intended to expre&s;s, is conveyed by them without Diminution. So that in one Ca&s;e, there is only a limited Commi&s;&s;ion given; but in the other, a Commi&s;&s;ion without any Re&s;triction or Limitation, and con&s;equently extending to <HI>all</HI> eccle&s;ia&s;tical Of|fices, which, in Fact, is al&s;o intended.</P>
<P>FOR it may be added, that were the Words ex|actly the &s;ame in both Ca&s;es, provided they were general, as in the original Commi&s;&s;ion given to the Apo&s;tles; it would not follow, that no farther Powers were given in the Ordination of a Bi&s;hop, than in that of a Pre&s;byter. For a new Ordination nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;es an Intention to convey &s;ome new Powers. Bi&s;hop Burnet ju&s;tly argues on the Subject, in the following Manner:
<Q>It is to be con&s;idered, that eccle&s;ia&s;tical Orders being from the Influence and Operation of the Holy Gho&s;t, which being one, yet hath <HI>different Operations</HI> for the <HI>different Admini&s;trations</HI>; therefore the concomitant Actions, Words and Circum&s;tances mu&s;t &s;hew, for <HI>which</HI> Admini&s;tration the Holy Gho&s;t is grayed for, &s;ince that general Prayer is made for all; but the Functions being dif|ferent, the &s;ame Holy Gho&s;t works differently in them all. Therefore it is plain from the Prac|tice of our Saviour, that there is no Need of expre&s;&s;ing in the very Words of Ordination, <HI>what</HI> Power is thereby given, &s;ince our Saviour did not expre&s;s it, but what he &s;aid both before and after, did determine the Sen&s;e of tho&s;e ge|neral Words to the apo&s;tolical Function. The
<PB N="44" REF="012007_0051_0F894101AE1827D8">
whole Office of con&s;ecrating Bi&s;hops (for In|&s;tance) &s;hews very formally and expre&s;sly, what Power is given in the&s;e (general) Words. Now though the Writers of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> would place the Form of Con&s;ecration in &s;ome imperative Words; yet we &s;ee no Rea&s;on for that, but the Complex of the whole Office is that which is chiefly to be con&s;idered, and mu&s;t determine the Sen&s;e of tho&s;e Words. So that a Prie&s;t being pre&s;ented to be made a Bi&s;hop, the King's Mandate being read for that Effect, he &s;wearing canonical Obedience as Bi&s;hop Elect, Prayers being put up for him as &s;uch, together with other Circum&s;tances which make it plain what they are about; tho&s;e general Words are by the&s;e qualified and re&s;trained to that Sen&s;e<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Burnet's <HI>Vindication of the Ordination,</HI> &amp;c. p. 64.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>HERE, in a <HI>Note,</HI> the Doctor &s;teps in with his old <HI>Reprint,</HI> and endeavours to prove from it that Bi&s;hops and Pre&s;byters <HI>were e&s;teemed one and the &s;ame Order,</HI> by the Compilers of that Ordinal. For it is <HI>worthy of &s;pecial Remark,</HI> &s;ays he, that <HI>previ|ous</HI> (meaning <HI>previou&s;ly) to the Ordination of Prie&s;ts, Acts</HI> xx. <HI>from the</HI> 19<HI>th to the</HI> 24<HI>th Ver&s;e</HI> (he &s;hould have &s;aid, from the 17th to the 35th inclu&s;ive) <HI>was appointed to be read for the Epi&s;tle; which mu&s;t be e&s;teemed highly impertinent, if they were not, as</HI> EPISCOPOI <HI>to</HI> RULE (POIMANEIN) <HI>as well as feed the Church of God.</HI> That Portion of Scripture contains an Account of St. Paul's Interview with the Elders from Ephe&s;us; at which he informs them in what Manner he had conducted him&s;elf in the Execution of the apo&s;tolical Office, gives them a &s;olemn Charge to attend to the Duties of their Mi|ni&s;try, and concludes with an affectionate Leave and
<PB N="45" REF="012007_0052_0F8941026DCFD050">
Benediction. Such an Example, and &s;uch an Ex|hortation, might, I conceive, very properly be recommended to the careful Con&s;ideration of every Candidate for the Orders, either of a Bi&s;hop, or a Prie&s;t, or even of a Deacon. St. Paul &s;ometimes propo&s;es his own Example as a Pattern for Chri&s;ti|ans in common; and it may, with peculiar Pro|priety, be propo&s;ed for the Imitation of Clergy|men. This is hinted, on the Suppo&s;ition that the Elders from Ephe&s;us were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of tho&s;e Pow|ers, which are appropriated to Bi&s;hops. But there is no Certainty that they were more than Pre&s;byters. Many learned Men, and Hooker and Hoadly a|mong others, are clear in the Opinion, that the Elders above-mentioned were nothing more: And this may have been the Opinion of the Compilers of the Ordinal.</P>
<P>THE Door farther urges, that <HI>Matt.</HI> xxviii. 18, 19, 20. or el&s;e <HI>John</HI> xx. 19&mdash;24, is appointed for the <HI>Go&s;pel; both which Pa&s;&s;ages of Scripture con|tain the highe&s;t Commi&s;&s;ion of Go&s;pel-Officers.</HI> But if the Commi&s;&s;ion for the &s;ubordinate Degrees of ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical Officers is included in this general Com|mi&s;&s;ion to the Apo&s;tles, and if they can produce no other original Commi&s;&s;ion than is contained in this; then, the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages of Scripture might, with no <HI>Incon&s;i&s;tency,</HI> be appointed to be read at the Or|dination of Pre&s;byters. And <HI>the Reviewers of the old Ordinal,</HI> after the Re&s;toration, might have re|moved them into the Office for the Ordination of Bi&s;hops, not becau&s;e they believed them to be <HI>not proper</HI> to be u&s;ed at the Ordination of Prie&s;ts, but, from an Opinion that they were <HI>more proper</HI> at the Con&s;ecration of Bi&s;hops.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="012007_0053_0F8941032E0A2200">In another <HI>Note,</HI> p. 28, the Doctor farther ar|gues to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e, from the <HI>Additions</HI> in the new Ordinal. At the Ordination of Prie&s;ts, after the Words, "receive the Holy Gho&s;t," the&s;e Words are added, FOR THE OFFICE AND WORK OF A PRIEST;&mdash;and, at the Con&s;ecration of Bi&s;hops, after the like Words, the&s;e Words are added, FOR THE OFFICE AND WORK OF A BISHOP. By this he &s;eems to think, that, according to the old Ordinal, Bi&s;hops were not ordained for the Office and Work of Bi&s;hops, nor Prie&s;ts for that of Prie&s;ts, becau&s;e tho&s;e particular Words were not u&s;ed on the Occa|&s;ion. But with the &s;ame Force and Propriety he might have argued, that the Apo&s;tles were not com|mi&s;&s;ioned, by our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, for <HI>the Office and Work</HI> of Apo&s;tles, becau&s;e the&s;e Words are not found in the Commi&s;&s;ion. But it was &s;ufficient, that the Compilers of the old Ordinal declared, in the Front of it, their Acknowledgment and Belief of three di&s;tinct Orders in the Church&mdash;that they com|po&s;ed a particular and di&s;tinct Office for the Ordina|tion of each Order&mdash;that there could be no Di&s;pute to <HI>which</HI> of the&s;e Orders, any particular Per&s;on, by his Ordination, was admitted, nor what were the pe|culiar Duties of his Office&mdash;and that all this was ap|proved of, and con&s;ented to, by the Bi&s;hops and Clergy, and e&s;tabli&s;hed by the King and Parliament. After all, it is not denied that the Alterations and Amendments, introduced into the new Ordinal, were a real Improvement; and particularly, as Words are therein u&s;ed with greater Preci&s;ion.</P>

of Time, Paper and Patience, to make a particu|ar Reply to it.</P>
<P>I NOW return to Mr. Shaw. His De&s;ign in the remainder of this Extract, extending from p. 29 to 35, is no le&s;s than to prove, that the Church of England at this Day allows Pre&s;byters to have the Power of Ordination, as inherently and e&s;&s;entially as Bi&s;hops them&s;elves. The Attempt is arduous and romantic, and &s;hould it appear that he has mi&s;carried in the Execution, &s;till it may be &s;aid of him, as was &s;aid of a notable Adventurer be|fore him,
<Q>&mdash;magnis tamen excidit Au&s;is.</Q></P>
<P>THAT the Church of England allows to Pre&s;by|ters the Power of <HI>ordaining,</HI> he endeavours to prove, in the fir&s;t Place, from the <HI>Rubric</HI> in the Office for the Ordination of Prie&s;ts, which requires that <HI>the Bi&s;hop with the</HI> PRIESTS <HI>pre&s;ent &s;hall lay their Hands &s;everally upon the Head of every one that receiveth the Order of Prie&s;thood.</HI> This <HI>Rubric,</HI> as well as every other Rule or Injunction, ought to be inter|preted according to the Sen&s;e in which it is e&s;tab|li&s;hed by Authority, if that Sen&s;e can be certainly known. But could it be the Intention of the Church in this <HI>Rubric,</HI> to contradict the whole Tenor of the Ordinal, and every Declaration and Intima|tion that &s;he had made and given, relating to the Subject? Was there ever an epi&s;copal Church, in any Age, that allowed the Power of Ordination to be in any other Hands, than of Bi&s;hops? Was it the Opinion of tho&s;e who were commi&s;&s;ioned to review the old Ordinal, and frame the new one, or of any Individual in that Commi&s;&s;ion, that all the
<PB N="48" REF="012007_0055_0F894104AEA68910">
Pre&s;byters in the Kingdom, convened in one Body, could effectually ordain a &s;ingle Pre&s;byter?&mdash;Or, that any Bi&s;hop in the Kingdom had not, as e&s;&s;ential to his Office, the full Power of Ordination in him|&s;elf? If this was not the Opinion of tho&s;e Review|ers, nor of the Governors of the Church, nor of the civil Authority, at that Time; we may be certain that the <HI>Rubric</HI> means no &s;uch Thing, and is an Evidence of no &s;uch Thing, as it is alledged to prove. It requires indeed that the Bi&s;hop &s;hall admit the Prie&s;ts, that are pre&s;ent, to join with him in the Impo&s;ition of Hands; but it does not &s;ay, nor give the lea&s;t Intimation, that it is with a View of rendering the Ordination more valid and compleat, than it would have been by the Impo&s;i|tion of the Bi&s;hop's Hands only. Every Impo&s;ition of Hands is not with a De&s;ign to ordain; and there is the highe&s;t Evidence, that, in this Ca&s;e, Ordina|tion is not the De&s;ign of the Church in general, nor of the Bi&s;hop that officiates, nor of the Pre&s;by|ters them&s;elves who practice this Rite. If the Pre&s;byter convey any &s;piritual Authority, it is without their own Knowledge and Intention, and by a barely mechanical Operation.</P>
<P>THE Impo&s;ition of the Hands of Pre&s;byters, in Conjunction with tho&s;e of the Bi&s;hop, has been practiced in every Age of the Church, in a greater or le&s;s Degree; but it was never thought to be any Part, much le&s;s an <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> Part, of Ordination, as this Writer calls it. The Practice was common and almo&s;t univer&s;al, in the fourth Century. A Canon of the 4th Council of Carthage, is thus worded:
<Q>Pre&s;byter cum ordinatur, &amp;c. <HI>i. e.</HI> when a Pre&s;byter is ordained, while the Bi&s;hop pro|nounces the Ble&s;&s;ing, and lays his Hand upon his
<PB N="49" REF="012007_0056_0F8941057309B450">
Head, all the Pre&s;byters that are pre&s;ent &s;hall lay their Hands, by the Bi&s;hop's Hand, upon his Head al&s;o.</Q>
At that Time flouri&s;hed St. <HI>Jerom,</HI> who was thoroughly acquainted with the Cu&s;toms of the Church, and knew that the Impo&s;ition of the Hands of Pre&s;byters, at the Ordination of a Fellow-Pre&s;byter, was the daily Practice. But did he believe that the Power of Ordination, or any Part of that Power, was exerci&s;ed by Pre&s;byters? So far from it, that in his famous Epi&s;tle to <HI>Eva|grius,</HI> wherein he endeavours to exalt their Order as high as po&s;&s;ible, he confe&s;&s;es, that, from the Acts or Offices which they perform in common with Bi|&s;hops, <HI>Ordination</HI> mu&s;t be <HI>excepted.</HI> If therefore the Impo&s;ition of the Hands of Pre&s;byters in St. Je|rom's Time, was no Proof of their having Power to ordain, it can be no Proof now<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See the <HI>Apo&s;tolical Con&s;titutions,</HI> Lib. viii. Cap. 28, where it is &s;aid of a Pre&s;byter:

<P>THIS Writer in&s;i&s;ts upon it, that the Impo&s;ition of the Hands of Pre&s;byters, in this Ca&s;e, mu&s;t be for the Purpo&s;e of Ordination; becau&s;e it cannot be pretended that it <HI>does only &s;ignify their witne&s;&s;ing to, or approbating, the Thing done.</HI> But why not <HI>witne&s;&s;ing?</HI> This, he &s;ays, <HI>might as well be done by the Laity who are pre&s;ent, or the Deacons</HI> All that are pre&s;ent are undoubtedly Witne&s;&s;es of the Tran&s;|action, but in &s;ome Ca&s;es <HI>cho&s;en Witne&s;&s;es</HI> may be thought proper, as is appointed in the Office of Bapti&s;m for <HI>Adults,</HI> although the whole Congrega|tion are Witne&s;&s;es at the &s;ame Time. Or, why not <HI>approbating?</HI> Is there any Impropriety in calling upon the Clergy that are pre&s;ent, to &s;ignify their Con&s;ent to, and <HI>Approbation</HI> of, the Ordination of
<PB N="50" REF="012007_0057_0F894106349B25D8">
a particular Per&s;on to that &s;acred Office, with which they have been inve&s;ted them&s;elves? And may not the Impo&s;ition of Hands, in the Manner required, be the e&s;tabli&s;hed Sign of it? It is true, the Church has not &s;aid that this is the Intention; nor certainly has it &s;aid that Ordination is the Intenti|on. And where no explicit Declarations are made by the Church of its Views and intentions, every Per&s;on is left to judge of them by the Evidence he can collect.</P>
<P>ANOTHER Argument that Pre&s;byters in the Church of England have <HI>ordaining Powers,</HI> is founded by this Writer on the U&s;e of the Word OUR, in the Act of Ordination, where the Bi&s;hop &s;ays:
<Q>Receive the Holy Gho&s;t for the Office and Work of a Prie&s;t in the Church of God, now committed unto thee by the Impo&s;ition of OUR, Hands.</Q>
To this a very brief An&s;wer is &s;uffi|cient. There are In&s;tances of the like U&s;e of the &s;ame Word in our public Offices, which if they will not prove what it po&s;itively <HI>does</HI> mean, will however enable us to determine what it <HI>does not</HI> mean. At the Bapti&s;m of Infants, the officiating Clergyman prays:
<Q>Grant that who&s;oever is here dedicated to thee by OUR Office and Mini&s;try, &amp;c:</Q>
&mdash;And at the Bapti&s;m of Adults:
<Q>Grant that they being dedicated to thee by OUR Office and Mini&s;try, &amp;c.</Q>
Now in the&s;e Places, the Word OUR certainly does not mean, that tho&s;e who are pre&s;ent a&s;&s;i&s;t in the Admini&s;tration of Bapti&s;m, or that this Ordinance is not admini&s;ter|ed by the Prie&s;t only; And therefore we may de|pend upon it, that at the Ordination of a Pre&s;by|ter, it does not mean, that the Ordination is not performed by the Bi&s;hop only. What the Word
<PB N="51" REF="012007_0058_0F894107DCFC41F0">
actually does mean, is not my Bu&s;ine&s;s here to de|termine.</P>
<P>I HAVE now done with Mr. Shaw; having &s;hewn the Weakne&s;s of his Arguments, and having an&s;|wered or obviated all that he or the Doctor &s;ays in Support of them. Indeed I might have taken No|tice, that both of them &s;eem to proceed on the Suppo&s;ition, that whatever is ordered by Autho|rity, is injoined as <HI>equally</HI> nece&s;&s;ary or important. According to this Mode of thinking, the Church of England makes wearing a Surplice as nece&s;&s;ary as the public Service; and the Circum&s;tance of kneeling at the Communion to be as e&s;&s;ential, as the great Duty of receiving that holy Sacrament. And then, to be &s;ure, the Impo&s;ition of the Hands of Pre&s;byters at the Ordination of a Prie&s;t, mu&s;t be as e&s;&s;ential to the Validity of the Performance, as the Impo&s;ition of the Bi&s;hop's Hands, &s;ince both are ordered in the &s;ame <HI>Rubric.</HI> But &s;uch an ab&s;urd Way of Rea&s;oning de&s;erves not a formal Refutation; and I am under &s;ome Apprehen&s;ion that I may be thought, by the &s;en&s;ible Reader, to have been alrea|dy too particular in replying to Things of this Na|ture. I &s;hall therefore not &s;top a Moment to make any Reflections upon &s;uch a gro&s;s Mi&s;repre&s;entation of the Ordinal, and of the Church of England; but proceed immediately to other Matters.</P>
<P>IN his <HI>An&s;wer</HI> to the <HI>Appeal,</HI> the Doctor urged, that if the Preface to the Ordinal were explained by what appears to have been the Sentiments of tho&s;e that compiled it, it would not prove that the Church of England was epi&s;copal, at that Time, in the Sen&s;e of the <HI>Appeal.</HI> It was replied, that the Sen&s;e of any Church mu&s;t be taken from
<PB N="52" REF="012007_0059_0F8941086CFF35F8">
her public Offices and Declarations, and not from the known or &s;uppo&s;ed Sentiments of Individuals. It was farther ob&s;erved, that as to the Compilers of the Engli&s;h Ordinal, it did not appear that their private Sentiments were different from what they publickly expre&s;&s;ed; but, on the other Hand, that there was &s;ufficient Evidence to convince the im|partial, that the principal Per&s;ons employed in that Service believed the divine, or apo&s;tolical In&s;titu|tion of Epi&s;copacy. In Order to &s;hew this, I en|tered into a particular Examination of the Subject, and took proper Notice of all that Dr. Chauncy had alledged, in Support of the contrary. I con|&s;idered the Evidence contained in the INSTITUTI|ON, and ERUDITION, <HI>of a Chri&s;tian Man,</HI> com|po&s;ed and publi&s;hed under the Direction of Arch|bi&s;hop CRANMER, in the Reign of HENRY VIII, as far as I could collect it from <HI>Collier</HI>'s Ab&s;tract, and from other Accounts.</P>
<P>ON this Examination, the INSTITUTION ap|peared favourable to the Doctrine of Epi&s;copacy; and a Pa&s;&s;age was produced, wherein, among other Things, it is &s;aid, that
<Q>Bi&s;hops are authori&s;ed by our Saviour to <HI>continue the Succe&s;&s;ion,</HI> and <HI>perpetuate the</HI> HIERARCHY.</Q>
The Doctor in|deed had quoted Dr. Calamy's Quotation, from the INSTITUTION and ERUDITION of the follow|ing Sentence:
<Q>Prie&s;ts and Bi&s;hops <HI>by Gods Law</HI> are one and the &s;ame; and the Power of Or|dination and Excommunication belongs <HI>equally</HI> to them both.</Q>
The&s;e two Sentences are con|tradictory; and the true Way of &s;ettling the Point, whether they are fairly extracted or not, would be to have Recour&s;e to the Books them&s;elves, which is not in my Power. But, from Collier's Account,
<PB N="53" REF="012007_0060_0F8941092D382C00">
I &s;u&s;pect there is &s;ome Mi&s;take made, either by Dr. Calamy or Dr. Chauncy, and that if their Quotation is made fairly, it is from the ERUDI|TION only, and not from the INSTITUTION. If the Doctor will prove that I am mi&s;taken, and that the Sentence quoted is contained in the INSTI|TUTION, I will allow that it greatly weakens the Evidence I produced from it on the other Side, as, on that Suppo&s;ition, he argues ju&s;tly, in p. 37. But &s;ince I have as high an Opinion of Collier's Hone&s;ty, as he has of Calamy's, he mu&s;t not ex|pect me to give up the Te&s;timony of my Author, becau&s;e it is contradicted by his. But if it &s;hould be found on the other Hand, that the Doctor's Quotation, from Calamy, is not fairly made from the INSTITUTION; and mine, from Collier, or the Sub&s;tance of it, is: Then my Argument is con|clu&s;ive, and all that he &s;ays in Reply to it falls of Cour&s;e.</P>
<P>AS to the ERUDITION, I allowed that it had, in Collier's Ab&s;tract, &s;uch a doubtful Appearance, that nothing could be ju&s;tly concluded from it, but that the Principles of the Reformers were, at this Time, with Regard to &s;ome Points, in an un&s;et|tled, fluctuating State. It contained Pa&s;&s;ages, if not directly contradictory, yet which I knew not how to reconcile, to one another. In one Place it &s;ays:
<Q>the Scripture &s;peaks expre&s;sly of no more than the two Orders of Prie&s;ts and Deacons.</Q>
And yet, in other Places, according to Collier,
<Q>that the two Orders (of Bi&s;hops and Prie&s;ts) were di&s;tinct and &s;ubordinate, <HI>is plain from this</HI> ERUDITION.</Q>
But then, as was ob&s;erved farther, this Book was drawn up only by a Committee ap|pointed by the King, and did not expre&s;s the gene|ral
<PB N="54" REF="012007_0061_0F894109ED1F9ED8">
Sen&s;e of the Church as the INSTITUTION did, which was formally con&s;ented to by both Hou&s;es of Convocation. The Doctor &s;ays, p. 39, there is no Difficulty in reconciling the Pa&s;&s;ages I had quoted. For <HI>if, as the&s;e Reformers &s;ay,</HI>
<Q>the Scripture makes mention of only the two orders of Prie&s;ts and Deacons,</Q>
<HI>Bi&s;hops cannot in their Opinion be a di&s;tinct Order from Prie&s;ts; and con&s;e|quently,</HI> what is a&s;cribed to the Bi&s;hop, is a&s;cribed to <HI>an Officer of the &s;ame Rank with Prie&s;ts.</HI> On this Suppo&s;ition, the Conclu&s;ion indeed is ju&s;t. But if, as Collier a&s;&s;erts, who knew more of the Matter than either of us, it
<Q>is plain from this ERUDITION, that the two Orders are di&s;tinct and &s;ubordinate;</Q>

<P>AFTER all, the Sentiments of the Bi&s;hops and Clergy at <HI>this Period,</HI> were not con&s;idered as of any great Con&s;equence in this Di&s;pute. The INSTITU|TION was publi&s;hed in 1537, and the ERUDITION in 1540, for temporary U&s;e, while the Nation was but ju&s;t emerging from Popery, and before it had Time to purge it&s;elf from the old Leaven <NOTE N="(&sect;)" PLACE="foot">See the Extracts from Bramhall and Burnet, in the <HI>Appeal Defended,</HI> p. 25.</NOTE>. To perform &s;o great a Work properly, required much Time and Caution. Of this, Cranmer and his A&s;&s;ociates were duly &s;en&s;ible; and, for the Honour of the Engli&s;h Reformation, they pro|ceeded with much greater Coolne&s;s and Delibera|tion, than the Reformers in any other Country had done. And the Method they pur&s;ued was, to con|&s;ider di&s;tinctly one Doctrine after another, with the

clo&s;e&s;t Attention, until the whole Sy&s;tem &s;hould be examined, and placed on the &s;ure Ba&s;is of Scrip|ture Authority, as was ob&s;erved in my <HI>Defence.</HI> As a Proof of this, the &s;everal <HI>Que&s;tions</HI> given out to the mo&s;t eminent Divines for their Examination and Deci&s;ion, were pointed out.
<Q>For it was at <HI>this Time,</HI> and not Ten Years afterwards, in the Reign of EDWARD VI, as Dr. Chauncy, follow|ing his blind Guide the IRENICUM, a&s;&s;erts, that the&s;e <HI>Que&s;tions</HI> were given out for Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, as is plain from Bi&s;hop Burnet<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Appeal defended,</HI> p. 24.</NOTE>,</Q> with whom Strype a|grees<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Memorials of <HI>Cranmer,</HI> p. 78.</NOTE>. To this he replies, p. 40, <HI>If this is plain from Bi&s;hop Burnet, he is the blind Guide to the Doctor, and not the</HI> Irenicum <HI>to me. For it is ob&s;ervable, the&s;e Que&s;tions with the Re&s;olutions of them are pub|li&s;hed by Bi&s;hop Burnet</HI>
<Q>ex. M. S. S. D. Stilling|fleet,</Q>
<HI>as his own Words are.</HI></P>
<P>IT is a Matter of great Importance in this Di&s;|pute, to &s;ettle the Time <HI>when</HI> the&s;e <HI>Que&s;tions</HI> were given out and an&s;wered. Bi&s;hop Burnet &s;ays it was in 1540; the Author of the <HI>Irenicum,</HI> that it was long afterwards in the Reign of EDWARD VI. One of them mu&s;t be wrong, and the Que&s;tion is, which of them is the <HI>blind Guide.</HI> It ought not to be &s;up|po&s;ed that either of them intended to deceive his Readers; but one of them mu&s;t have been de|ceived him&s;elf. <HI>Which</HI> then, was mo&s;t likely to have made the Mi&s;take?</P>
<P>AND here it de&s;erves Notice, that Stillingfleet wrote his <HI>Irenicum</HI> with evident Ha&s;te and Precipi|tation, and under the Influence of a Zeal bordering upon Impetuo&s;ity. The Doctor knows, that Wri|ters
<PB N="56" REF="012007_0063_0F89410B6E4F06B8">
in the&s;e Circum&s;tances are liable even to mi&s;|take <HI>Facts</HI>; and <HI>Dates</HI> are more ea&s;ily mi&s;taken by them, e&s;pecially when they appear not to affect the chief Object in View. Thus the Author of the <HI>Irenicum,</HI> when he became cooler, and took a Re|tro&s;pect of his Performance, candidly confe&s;&s;ed, that it contained many Pa&s;&s;ages that &s;hewed his Youth, and want of Attention.</P>
<P>BUT the <HI>Hi&s;tory of the Reformation</HI> was the Work of Time, written with Compo&s;ure and Caution. In adju&s;ting the materials for his Hi&s;tory, which chiefly con&s;i&s;ted of original Manu&s;cripts, the Author was obliged carefully to attend to the Circum&s;tance of Dates. In this Way he became &s;o minutely ac|quainted with the Progre&s;s of the Reformation, that, from the very Nature and Words of tho&s;e <HI>Que&s;tions</HI> and <HI>An&s;wers,</HI> he mu&s;t have been able to arrange them in their proper Place, even if the Date had been omitted. And what renders his Account the more credible is, that he a&s;&s;igns a &s;pecial Rea&s;on for i&s;&s;uing out the <HI>Que&s;tions,</HI> viz. That the Committee, which was appointed to review and correct the <HI>In&s;titution,</HI> might be able to do it to bet|ter Purpo&s;e. For he repre&s;ents them to have been given out during the Cour&s;e of that Work, and when the Part relating to the Doctrine of the <HI>Seven</HI> Sacraments, as they were then called, came under Con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>BUT notwith&s;tanding the&s;e obvious Remarks in Favour of the <HI>Hi&s;tory,</HI> the Doctor is po&s;itive that Stillingfleet mu&s;t have been right, and Burnet wrong, becau&s;e the latter made U&s;e of the <HI>Manu|&s;cripts</HI> of the former. It is &s;trange, that a Man of Sen&s;e can think this has any <HI>Appearance</HI> of Rea&s;on|ing.
<PB N="57" REF="012007_0064_0F89410C2EF69D10">
If Burnet had tran&s;cribed <HI>from</HI> the <HI>Irenicum,</HI> his Date mu&s;t have been corrected <HI>by</HI> it; but to infer, that, becau&s;e he con&s;ulted the &s;ame <HI>Manu|&s;cripts</HI> that the Author of the <HI>Irenicum</HI> had con&s;ult|ed, THEREFORE his <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> mu&s;t be corrected by the <HI>Irenicum,</HI> in the In&s;tance before us, is a Specimen of new Logic, and curious it is. For my Part, I think it much more rea&s;onable to conclude, that the <HI>Irenicum,</HI> in this Particular, &s;hould be corrected by the <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI>; becau&s;e the Hi&s;torian con&s;ulted the &s;ame <HI>Manu&s;cripts,</HI> and yet altered the controverted Date as publi&s;hed in the <HI>Irenicum</HI>; which he would not have done without &s;ufficient Rea&s;on while the Author, who was his intimate Friend, was liv|ing, and might contradict him if he could. But more direct Evidence &s;hall be produced pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>LET us at pre&s;ent attend to the Doctor. <HI>Nay,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>Bi&s;hop Burnet him&s;elf was of the &s;ame Mind,</HI> viz. That the <HI>Que&s;tions</HI> and <HI>An&s;wers</HI> above|mentioned pa&s;&s;ed in the Reign of EDWARD VI: And to prove it, he tran&s;cribes from him, Words which make it evident that his own A&s;&s;ertion is fal&s;e. Let the Reader &s;ee with his own Eyes, and wonder!
<Q>I find, &s;ays the Hi&s;torian, <HI>another</HI> In|&s;tance <HI>like this,</HI> in the Reformation that was far|ther carried on in the &s;ucceeding Reign of EDWARD VI; of many Bi&s;hops and Divines giving in their Opinions under their Hands, upon <HI>&s;ome Heads</HI> then examined and changed<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Hi&s;tory of the Reformation,</HI> Vol. I. p. 289.</NOTE>.</Q>

given out at the Time when the ERUDITION was preparing. He &s;peaks of &s;uch a careful Method of proceeding, as an Evidence of the great Prudence u&s;ed in the Engli&s;h Reformation. He takes notice indeed, that there was <HI>another</HI> In&s;tance of the <HI>like</HI> Care in the next Reign. But the Papers that pa&s;&s;ed, in <HI>like</HI> Manner, in the next Reign, are &s;o far from being the &s;ame with tho&s;e under Con&s;iderati|on, that here is not the lea&s;t Intimation that they re|lated to the &s;ame Subjects; it being only &s;aid, that the Bi&s;hops and Divines at that Time, gave in their Opinions upon <HI>&s;ome</HI> Heads, then examined and changed. It would have been very natural for him to have &s;aid, <HI>the &s;ame Heads,</HI> unle&s;s they were different.</P>
<P>WHEN he comes to the Time, to which he re|fers, in the Reign of King EDWARD, he &s;ays:
<Q>This Winter (1548) there was a Committee of &s;elected Bi&s;hops and Divines appointed for exa|mining all the Offices of the Church, and for reforming them.&mdash;The Thing they fir&s;t examin|ed was the Sacrament of the <HI>Euchari&s;t</HI>; which being the chief Symbol of Chri&s;tian Communi|on, was thought to de&s;erve their chief Care. And <HI>here</HI> they managed their Enquiries <HI>in the &s;ame Manner</HI> that was u&s;ed in the former Reign; in which when any Thing was con&s;idered in Or|der to a Change, it was put into &s;everal <HI>Queries,</HI> to which every one in Commi&s;&s;ion was to give his <HI>An&s;wer in writing.</HI> It is no Wonder if the Con|fu&s;ions, that followed in Queen <HI>Mary</HI>'s Reign, have deprived us of mo&s;t of the&s;e Papers; yet there is <HI>one Set</HI> of them pre&s;erved, relating (N.

What was naturally to be in|fered
<PB N="59" REF="012007_0066_0F89410DAEE4F970">
from the former Pa&s;&s;age, is fully expre&s;&s;ed in this. The Hi&s;torian &s;ays plainly, that the <HI>Que&s;|tions</HI> given out in the Reign of King EDWARD, and to which he had refered in his former Vo|lume, related to the <HI>Euchari&s;t,</HI> as it was thought at that Time "to de&s;erve the chief Care". HERE, &s;ays he, <HI>i. e.</HI> in examining the Doctrine of the <HI>Eu|chari&s;t,</HI> they proceeded
<Q><HI>in the &s;ame Manner</HI> that was u&s;ed in the former Reign.</Q>
He does not in|timate that the <HI>Queries</HI> now given out related to any other Subject, than that of the <HI>Euchari&s;t</HI>; &s;o far from it, that the Words, and the whole Struc|ture of the Pa&s;&s;age, nece&s;&s;arily imply that they did not. He moreover &s;ays, that mo&s;t of the Papers that pa&s;&s;ed on that Occa&s;ion, are <HI>lo&s;t</HI>; however, that <HI>one Set</HI> of them has been pre&s;erved, a Copy of which he publi&s;hes in the <HI>Appendix</HI> to his <HI>&s;e|cond Volume.</HI> The Que&s;tions, in this only Set of Papers remaining, he tells us, related to
<Q>the Prie&s;ts &s;ingle communicating;</Q>
and upon In|&s;pection, there is not one of them that appears to have any more Reference to the Doctrine of Epi&s;|copacy, than to that of the <HI>Copernican Sy&s;tem.</HI> It is now as clear as the Meridian Sun in an uncloud|ed Sky, that <HI>Bi&s;hop Burnet him&s;elf was</HI> NOT <HI>of the &s;ame Mind</HI> with my Opponent, but affirmed and proved the contrary&mdash;that, with Regard to the <HI>Date</HI> in Que&s;tion, the <HI>Irenicum</HI> was the
<Q>blind Guide</Q>
&mdash;and that the Doctor is blinder &s;till, who out-faces a much brighter Evidence than was at|tended to by the Author of the <HI>Irenicum.</HI><NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">It is a more difficult Ta&s;k than mo&s;t Readers imagine, to deal with an Adver&s;ary that can mi&s;repre&s;ent Matters, at this Rate.

The Author of this <HI>farther Defence</HI> is thus unluckily &s;ituated. He is &s;en&s;ible of the Duty he owes to Truth, and to the Public; at the &s;ame Time, he wi&s;hes not to be wanting in that Charity, which
<Q>hopeth all Things, endureth all Things.</Q>
It pains him to entertain a hard Thought, or to &s;peak a har&s;h Word, of any Man; and yet he &s;ometimes finds both to be unavoidable, when thinking and &s;peaking of a Man, who is in high E&s;timation with many People, and who&s;e Character he greatly re&s;pected, at the Commencement of this Controver&s;y. In this critical Situation, as he knows the great Danger of acting improperly, he will be upon his Guard; and he hopes to meet with that Candor, which is not extreme to mark what, in &s;uch Circum&s;tances, may be done ami&s;s.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="012007_0067_0F89410E6CD90C70">HAVING &s;ettled the Date of the <HI>Que&s;tions</HI> and <HI>An&s;wers</HI> afore&s;aid, and fixed it to 1540, I mu&s;t again remind the Reader, that it was
<Q>about Ten Years before the Offices for Ordination were com|po&s;ed,</Q>
and before Cranmer appears to have &s;ettled his eccle&s;ia&s;tical Principles. It is therefore no won|der that, as Bi&s;hop Burnet ob&s;erves,
<Q>in Cranmer's Paper, &s;ome &s;ingular Opinions of his about eccle|&s;ia&s;tical Offices will be found.</Q>
But it de&s;erves &s;pecial Notice, that as this Hi&s;torian goes on to inform us,
<Q>afterwards he <HI>changed</HI> his Opinion. For he &s;ub&s;cribed the Book that was &s;oon after &s;et out [<HI>the</HI> ERUDITION] which is, (the very thing that Collier affirmed of it) <HI>directly contrary</HI> to tho&s;e Opinions &s;et down in the&s;e Papers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hi&s;t.

<P>AS a farther Proof that Cranmer altered his Opinion <HI>&s;oon afterwards,</HI> it was alledged, on the Authority of Doctor <HI>Durel,</HI> that he &s;ub&s;cribed to the <HI>Two Opinions</HI> of Dr. Leighton, in the&s;e very Papers, that were favourable to Epi&s;copacy. That Author &s;ays, that upon examining the original

<HI>Manu&s;cript,</HI> he found <HI>Th. Cantuarien&s;is</HI> &s;ub&s;cribed to both; which is omitted, either negligently or un|accountably, in Bi&s;hop Burnet's Copy. The Doc|tor objects to the Evidence of Durel, <HI>which,</HI> &s;ays he, p. 42, <HI>is no Evidence at all, if Mr. Boy&s;e may be believed, who &s;peaks of him as</HI>
<Q>an Author too notorious for his many Fal&s;ehoods and mi&s;|takes in this Kind to be depended on.</Q>
But &s;ome have given the &s;ame Character of Mr. Boy&s;e him&s;elf. Be that as it may, Dr. Durel's Character is not to be taken from Mr. Boy&s;e, nor from any other Writer again&s;t Epi&s;copacy. He had &s;aid and done too much in Favour of it, to expect fair Treatment from &s;uch as oppo&s;e it. He had &s;hewn that this Form of Government was held in high Veneration by all the reformed Churches abroad; that the Church of England was greatly com|mended and honoured by them for e&s;tabli&s;hing it; and that the Engli&s;h Di&s;&s;enters were utterly con|demned by them for di&s;obeying and rejecting it. For this he was treated, in his Life Time, with the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Scurrility by Hickman, and plentifully abu&s;ed by Dr. du Moulin; but it ought not to be forgotten that the latter of the&s;e Writers had the Grace to repent of this Conduct, and retract it, in his "LAST WORDS." Some People &s;ince have co|pied his Abu&s;e, but not his Repentance. Durel was well known in almo&s;t all the reformed Churches in Europe. In &s;ome of them he received Prefer|ment, and might have received it in others; and the many Letters &s;till extant, written to him by the mo&s;t eminent foreign Prote&s;tants of his Time, demon&s;trate that his Reputation was great, and his Character re&s;pectable. Having thus &s;hewn the Credibility of this Witne&s;s, it is not doubted but the candid will admit, upon his <HI>po&s;itive</HI> Te&s;timo|ny,
<PB N="62" REF="012007_0069_0F894110D3403CE8">
that the <HI>two Opinions</HI> of Dr. Leighton were actually con&s;ented to by Cranmer, and &s;igned <HI>Th. Cantuarien&s;is</HI>; notwith&s;tanding the <HI>negative</HI> Evi|dence of Bi&s;hop Burnet.</P>
<P>FROM that Time, viz. 1540,
<Q>I find in this great Reformer no Fluctuation of Principles; but many Proofs appear of his &s;ettled and &s;teady Belief, that Bi&s;hops are &s;uperior to Pre&s;byters, by apo&s;tolical In&s;titution<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Appeal defended,</HI> p. 30.</NOTE>.</Q>
Here Reference was particularly made to the <HI>Catechi&s;m</HI> he publi&s;hed in 1548, in which, Bi&s;hop Burnet who had &s;een it &s;ays,
<Q>he fully owns the <HI>divine</HI> In&s;titution of Bi|&s;hops.</Q>
To this the Doctor replies. p. 46; <HI>Could a Sight of this</HI> Catechi&s;m <HI>be obtained, it is</HI> PROBABLE <HI>it might be in our Power to refute what it here &s;aid from Bi&s;hop Burnet.</HI> We &s;ee, that, however firmly the Doctor relies upon the Bi&s;hop's <HI>negative</HI> Evidence, when in his Favour, he will allow but little Weight to his <HI>po&s;itive</HI> Evidence, when it makes again&s;t him; and that he offers his own bare groundle&s;s <HI>Suppo&s;ition,</HI> as &s;ufficient to confute it.</P>
<P>I AM not able to obtain a Sight of that <HI>Cate|chi&s;m,</HI> any more than the Doctor. It is extremely &s;carce at this Day; however, &s;ome Copies are ex|tant, and there is one, in particular, in the Arch|bi&s;hop's Library at Lambeth. A Gentleman of eminent Integrity, and who&s;e literary Fame is well known both at home and abroad, writes, in a Let|ter dated Feb. 16, 1770, that he had read this Copy more than once, and had made Extracts from it, among which he finds the following.
<Q>Fir&s;t, it is nece&s;&s;ary to our Salvation to have
<PB N="63" REF="012007_0070_0F8941116CF8A260">
Preachers and Mini&s;ters of God's Word to in|&s;truct us in the true Faith and Knowledge of God. Secondly, that Preachers mu&s;t not a&s;|&s;ume this Honour to them&s;elves, but mu&s;t be ordained and appointed to this Office. For as it is impo&s;&s;ible to be &s;aved without Faith, and we cannot believe without being taught of o|thers, &s;o Teachers, except they be &s;ent, cannot fruitfully teach. For the Seed of God's Word doth never bring forth Fruit unle&s;s the Lord of the Harve&s;t do give Increa&s;e, and by his Holy Spirit work with the Sower: but God doth not work with the Preacher whom he hath not &s;ent.&mdash; To know who are &s;ent, you are to under&s;tand that when our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t began to preach, he called and cho&s;e his 12 Apo&s;tles; and afterwards be&s;ides the&s;e Twelve, he &s;ent forth Three Score and Ten Di&s;ciples and gave them Authority to preach the Go&s;pel. And a little before his Death and Pa&s;&s;ion he made his Prayer to his heavenly Father for them, and for all tho&s;e who &s;hould believe through their preaching. John xvii.&mdash; And after Chri&s;t's A&s;cen&s;ion, the Apo&s;tles gave Authority to other holy Men to mini&s;ter God's Word. Where they found Men fit to preach God's Word they laid their Hands upon them and gave them the Holy Gho&s;t as they them|&s;elves received the &s;ame Holy Gho&s;t of Chri&s;t to execute this Office. And they that were &s;o ordained were indeed, and al&s;o were called the Mini&s;ters of God as the Apo&s;tles them&s;elves were. And thus the Mini&s;tration of God's Word (which our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf did fir&s;t in&s;titute) was derived from the Apo&s;tles Time to our Days. And this was the Con&s;ecra|tion, Orders and Unction of the Apo&s;tles, where|by
<PB N="64" REF="012007_0071_0F8941122D21A278">
they at the Beginning made Bi&s;hops and Prie&s;ts, and this &s;hall continue in the Church to the World's End.</Q></P>
<P>THIS Pa&s;&s;age, which is undoubtedly a faithful Tran&s;cript, is &s;ufficient to prove Bi&s;hop Burnet's A&s;&s;ertion. For it maintains a Difference of Orders by <HI>divine In&s;titution,</HI> between the <HI>Seventy,</HI> who could only mini&s;ter the Word, and the <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> who could al&s;o appoint others; and it a&s;&s;erts that the Power, whereby Bi&s;hops and Prie&s;ts were ori|ginally appointed, &s;hall continue to the End of the World. I &s;hall make no farther Remarks upon it; the curious Reader can examine the Pa&s;&s;age at his Lei&s;ure.</P>
<P>IT was mentioned as a farther Proof that when Cranmer had once &s;ettled his eccle&s;ia&s;tical Princi|ples, he &s;teadily adhered to them; that in his Ser|mon, <HI>of the Authority of the Keys,</HI> publi&s;hed to|gether with his <HI>Catechi&s;m,</HI>
<Q>his Notions of Epi&s;|copacy and Church-Government are &s;o high, that even the <HI>high-flying</HI> Dr. Hicks reprinted it at large, in his Preface to,
<Q>the divine Right of Epi&s;copacy a&s;&s;erted.</Q></Q>
The Doctor replies: <HI>This Sermon is, I conclude, the very one repaired to by</HI> Mr. Drury <HI>in Order to prove that</HI> Cranmer <HI>re|tracted his Opinion about Bi&s;hops and Prie&s;ts; to whom</HI> Mr. Boy&s;e <HI>replies,</HI>
<Q>the Pa&s;&s;age he has cited in this Sermon no Way a&s;&s;erts Prie&s;ts and Bi|&s;hops to be at the Biginning two di&s;tinct Orders.</Q>
So then; the Sermon, it &s;eems, does not prove the Point for which it is alledged, becau&s;e a parti|cular Pa&s;&s;age in the Sermon does not prove it; and that Pa&s;&s;age does not prove it, becau&s;e Mr. Boy&s;e &s;ays it does not. But any one, who is acquainted
<PB N="65" REF="012007_0072_0F894112EE2D0B80">
with Dr. Hicks's Character and Writings, mu&s;t know that he was as good a Judge, in this Ca&s;e, as Mr. Boy&s;e; and his Inducement to publi&s;h the Sermon, if it made not for his Purpo&s;e, &s;urely was not equal to Mr. Boy&s;e's Temptation, after it was publi&s;hed, to &s;ay that it was not for his Pur|po&s;e, when it really was.</P>
<P>THE Doctor after denying that the Reformed Church of England was originally epi&s;copal, had &s;aid, in the Words of Mr. J. Owen, that the Doc|trine of Epi&s;copacy, as now contended for, was
<Q>FIRST promoted in the Church of England by Archbi&s;hop Laud.</Q>
It was an&s;wered:
<Q>There may indeed be &s;ome &s;ecret Meaning in the Word <HI>promoted,</HI> which I do not comprehend; but until it be unfolded, I mu&s;t take the Liberty to believe, that the national E&s;tabli&s;hment of this Doctrine, again and again, and making it a fundamental Principle of the Reformation, was doing &s;ome|thing to <HI>promote</HI> it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Appeal defended,</HI> p. 32.</NOTE>.</Q>
In his <HI>Reply,</HI> p. 48, he thus explains him&s;elf: <HI>Archbi&s;hop</HI> Laud, <HI>without all Doubt, was the fir&s;t&mdash;in Oppo&s;ition to any nati|onal E&s;tabli&s;hment, or its being at all a Principle, much le&s;s a fundamental one of the Reformation, that openly a&s;&s;erted and pleaded for the Doctrine.</HI> This <HI>Re&s;pon&s;e</HI> is more <HI>oracular</HI> and <HI>my&s;terious</HI> than the former.

that he pleaded for the apo&s;tolical In&s;titution of Epi&s;copacy, as a fundamental Principle of the Church of England, which I know not that he ever did, in &s;o many Words; but what I &s;aid was, that its having been e&s;tabli&s;hed as &s;uch, proves that it had been <HI>promoted</HI> before his Time. But I will not enlarge. As I under&s;tand not this con|fu&s;ed Sentence, I may mi&s;take its Meaning, or give it a Meaning where it has none.</P>
<P>IT was farther an&s;wered, that
<Q>if the Meaning of the Word <HI>promoted,</HI> be, that none before Arch|bi&s;hop Laud contended for the Superiority of Bi&s;hops over Pre&s;byters, by divine Appointment, in their <HI>Writings,</HI> I mu&s;t &s;till deny it; as I am able to produce abundant Evidence to the con|trary.</Q>
This, I believe, was Part, if not the whole, of the Doctor's original Meaning; and I proved his Mi&s;take, by producing many Authors before Laud, that contended for this Doctrine in their Writings. He now half confe&s;&s;es his Mi&s;take&punc; by &s;aying that for this A&s;&s;ertion he depended upon the Authority of Mr. J. Owen. I advi&s;e him to be more careful for the future, upon what Authors he puts his Dependence; for &s;ome of them, if tru&s;ted too freely, will bring one into Trouble. The Doctor comforts him&s;elf however, that, in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, his Mi&s;take is but trifling. <HI>Of what great Importance is it,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>whether he</HI> (Laud) <HI>was the fir&s;t, &s;econd, third or fourth that contended for this Doctrine?</HI> In his former Pamphlet he urged it as a Point of great Importance. This brought on the Di&s;pute, whether the Fact was as he a&s;&s;er|ted it. In this Di&s;pute, &s;uch as it is, the only Que&s;tion was, whether Laud in Reality was the fir&s;t that maintained the Doctrine, or not. If he
<PB N="67" REF="012007_0074_0F8941146E513550">
was the &s;econd only, he could not be the fir&s;t, in the Sen&s;e of the Que&s;tion. So plain a Ca&s;e has but little need of Illu&s;tration: However, let us &s;uppo&s;e the Doctor had a&s;&s;erted that Lord An&s;on was the fir&s;t that had &s;ailed round the Globe, and had in&s;i&s;ted upon it as a Matter of great Con&s;e|quence; and that another had taken him up upon this Point, and &s;hewn, from the be&s;t Authorities, that Drake, Cavendi&s;h and many others had en|compa&s;&s;ed the Globe long before him:&mdash;Would it have been deemed a ju&s;t Reply if he had &s;aid, it is a Matter of no Importance, whether An&s;on was the fir&s;t, &s;econd, third or fourth? Although this might be &s;aid perhaps truly, yet it could not be &s;aid pro|perly, with Reference to a Debate where it was the only Point in Que&s;tion.</P>
<P>THE Per&s;ons introduced as prior to Laud in a&s;|&s;erting the divine Right of Epi&s;copacy, were <HI>Whitgift</HI> (under the Patronage of Archbi&s;hop Par|ker and Bi&s;hop Cooper,) Bancroft, Hutton, Bil&s;on, Hooker and Saravia. This Li&s;t might have been ea&s;ily enlarged, but it was thought &s;ufficient; and it was clearly proved, that they all contended for the divine Right of Epi&s;copacy. Dr. Chauncy &s;ays in Reply: <HI>They were, it is true, Epi&s;copalians on the Foot of divine Right, in a</HI> QUALIFIED, MI|TIGATED <HI>Sen&s;e; but not in the Sen&s;e in which</HI> Laud <HI>and the Doctor plead for this Right.</HI> p. 49. This Gentleman has the be&s;t Knack I have ever met with, of &s;hifting for him&s;elf, and repairing his Lo&s;&s;es. After having been obliged to give up the Point in Di&s;pute here, and to allow that the above|mentioned Per&s;ons were <HI>Epi&s;copalians on the Foot of a divine Right,</HI> contrary to what he had &s;trenu|ou&s;ly in&s;i&s;ted upon as a Matter of Importance; he
<PB N="68" REF="012007_0075_0F8941152E388118">
gets a Reinforcement from <HI>Stephen Lob,</HI> or &s;ome other Author of an anonymous Pamphlet, and re|turns with his Di&s;tinctions, and explains away his Conce&s;&s;ion&mdash;by &s;aying that the divine Right for which tho&s;e Epi&s;copalians contended, was not a divine Right properly, but a divine Right in a <HI>qualified, mitigated</HI> Sen&s;e. How many <HI>Sorts</HI> of di|vine Right there are in his Opinion, and what <HI>De|gree</HI> of Mitigation he intended, he ought to have told us; for it is in vain to di&s;pute with him, with|out under&s;tanding his Di&s;tinctions.</P>
<P>HE attempts not to &s;hew that the Principles of Hutton, Bil&s;on and Saravia were mi&s;repre&s;ented; but what was &s;aid to prove that Whitgift, Bancroft and Hooker believed and maintained the divine Right of Epi&s;copacy, he confronts with Evidence brought in by Stephen Lob, tending to prove, in his Opinion, that they were Epi&s;copalians, not of the fir&s;t Rate like Laud, but in a <HI>qualified, miti|gated</HI> Sen&s;e. The fir&s;t of the&s;e Writers is quoted, p. 50, as di&s;tingui&s;hing between Things that are <HI>&s;o nece&s;&s;ary that without them we cannot be &s;aved,</HI> and &s;uch as are <HI>&s;o nece&s;&s;ary that without them we cannot</HI> SO WELL <HI>and</HI> CONVENIENTLY <HI>be &s;aved</HI>; and then &s;aying that it is only by this &s;econd Kind of Nece&s;&s;ity, that Government, or any particular Form of it, is nece&s;&s;ary for the Church. But this, which is given as the Opinion of Whitgift, by no Means implies, that he thought Epi&s;copacy not to be of apo&s;tolical In&s;titution&mdash;much le&s;s, that he thought Men might depart from it without evi|dent Nece&s;&s;ity&mdash;and lea&s;t of all, that they were at Liberty to &s;et up a Form of eccle&s;ia&s;tical Go|vernment in <HI>Oppo&s;ition</HI> to it. Nor does it contra|dict the Declaration he made to Beza in the fol|lowing
<PB N="69" REF="012007_0076_0F894115EE851E60">
Words:
<Q>We make no Doubt but that the epi&s;copal Degree, is an In&s;titution apo&s;to|lical and divine, and &s;o always hath been held by a continual Cour&s;e of Times from the Apo|&s;tles to this very Age of ours.</Q>
I know of no Epi&s;copalians that e&s;teem any Form of eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal Government to be &s;o ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, that without it <HI>we cannot be &s;aved.</HI> Even Laud him|&s;elf, who was an Epi&s;copalian of the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Rate, was not of this Opinion. He treated the foreign Prote&s;tant Churches, that were without epi&s;copal Government as Members of the &s;ame Body with the Church of England, and maintained with them a friendly Corre&s;pondence.
<Q>See his Letter in 1639, to the Swi&s;s Divines in the <HI>Prae&s;tantium Virorum Epi&s;tolae,</HI> Ep. 552, where they are cal|led by him <HI>Confratres mei chari&s;&s;imi:</HI> And of their Letter to him he &s;aith, <HI>it was agreeable to him on a double Account, as it was theirs, and ex|horting to Chri&s;tian Peace.

And he &s;aith to him in 1633, <HI>It is a mere Invention that the Engli&s;h Bi&s;hops de&s;ired to ex|tend their Juri&s;diction over the foreign prote&s;tant Churches: A Thing which they never &s;o much as dreamed of</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Second</HI> Letter to the Author of the <HI>Confe&s;&s;ional,</HI> p. 183.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>WHAT has been ob&s;erved hitherto, is on the Suppo&s;ition that Whitgift &s;poke in the Sen&s;e in which the Doctor under&s;tands him. But upon a
<PB N="70" REF="012007_0077_0F894116B1538870">
clo&s;er Examination I believe it will be found, that he had no particular Reference to Epi&s;copacy, in the Pa&s;&s;ages quoted. When he u&s;ed tho&s;e Expre&s;|&s;ions, he was combating a known Maxim of many of the Puritans, viz. That every Thing relating to the Government or Di&s;cipline of the Church, or to public Wor&s;hip, that is not clearly expre&s;&s;ed in Scripture, is unlawful. This was one of the Pil|lars, on which their famous <HI>Admonition to the Par|liament</HI> was erected, rotten as it was <NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">Strype's Life of Parker, p. 362.</NOTE>. Neal, their Hi&s;torian and Advocate, tells us, that
<Q><HI>Mr. Cart|wright maintained that</HI> the holy Scriptures were not only a Standard of Doctrine, but of Di&s;cipline and Government; and that the Church of Chri&s;t in all Ages was to be regulated by them. <HI>He was therefore for con&s;ulting his</HI> Bible only, <HI>and for reducing all Things as near as po&s;&s;ible to the apo&s;tolic Standard</HI> <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Puritans,</HI> Vol I. p. 231, <HI>Dub. Edit.</HI></NOTE>.</Q>
In confuting this Princi|ple, as it was applied by the Puritans, Whitgift might have &s;aid:
<Q>There is no certain Kind of Government or Di&s;cipline, pre&s;cribed to the Church; but that the &s;ame may be altered as the Profit of the Churches requires.&mdash;I do deny, that the Scriptures do &s;et down any one certain Kind of Government in the Church to be perpe|tual, for all Times, Per&s;ons and Places without Alteration:</Q>
I &s;ay, he might have u&s;ed the&s;e and the like Expre&s;&s;ions, &s;peaking in the Sen&s;e of the Puritans, and yet have believed the Doctrine of Epi&s;copacy in as high a Sen&s;e as Laud him&s;elf did.</P>
<P>TO prove that Bancroft was not epi&s;copal, on the Footing of a divine Right, except in a <HI>quali|fied,
<PB N="71" REF="012007_0078_0F8941176D2BDF90">
mitigated</HI> Sen&s;e, and that he <HI>allowed Ordination by Pre&s;byters to be valid,</HI> the Doctor, in p. 51, mentions the Ca&s;e of the three Scots Pre&s;byters who were con&s;ecrated Bi&s;hops with his Con&s;ent, without any previous Ordinations by the Impo&s;i|tion of epi&s;copal Hands. This Ca&s;e he had men|tioned in his former Pamphlet with the like View; and it was &s;aid, in An&s;wer, that tho&s;e Per&s;ons were immediately con&s;ecrated Bi&s;hops on this Principle,
<Q>that the epi&s;copal Character, as it included tho&s;e of a Pre&s;byter and a Deacon, might be conveyed by a &s;ingle Con&s;ecration, as in the Ca&s;e of Am|bro&s;e and Nectarius.</Q>
He now replies, <HI>as this is re&s;ted on no other Proof than the Doctor's own Affirmation, it ought to be con&s;idered as nothing.</HI> Experience has taught me not to be &s;urpri&s;ed, in this Controver&s;y, at the mo&s;t unexpected and ex|traordinary A&s;&s;ertions; and therefore I can, with the utmo&s;t Calmne&s;s, a&s;&s;ure the Reader, that what is here &s;aid to be <HI>re&s;ted on no other Proof than my own Affirmation,</HI> was re&s;ted <HI>altogether</HI> on other Evi|dence; and that Collier's <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;tory,</HI> Vol. II. p. 701, and Grey's <HI>An&s;wer to Peirce,</HI> p. 143, were particularly quoted for this Account, as any one may &s;ee, upon turning to the <HI>Appeal de|fended,</HI> p. 46, 47. If Spot&s;wood gives a different Account of this Affair, it only follows that it is a di&s;puted Ca&s;e; and it is a much fairer Method to judge of Bancroft's Principles by what he clearly &s;ays in his Writings, than from the doubtful Evi|dence of a di&s;puted Fact. Every Man mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed be&s;t to know his own Principles; and his own Declaration mu&s;t be the be&s;t Proof of what Doctrines he believes. Let the Reader then attend to Bancroft him&s;elf explaining his own Principles, relating to this Head, and placing them as the Foun|dation
<PB N="72" REF="012007_0079_0F8941182D5B57E8">
of his capital Work.
<Q>As God him&s;elf, &s;ays he, appointed an <HI>Inequality</HI> among&s;t the Prie&s;ts of the Old Te&s;tament: As in Chri&s;t's <HI>In&s;tituti|on,</HI> the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> were &s;uperior to the <HI>Seventy</HI> Di&s;ciples: As the Apo&s;tles, when the Go&s;pel began to &s;pread it&s;elf, <HI>appointed</HI> &s;undry <HI>Timo|thies</HI> and <HI>Titu&s;es,</HI> to govern the Churches in divers Countries and Territories: As all the eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;tories do record the <HI>Superiority</HI> of <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> and do &s;et down the Catalogues of many of them, and which of the Apo&s;tles and apo&s;tolical Bi&s;hops, and in what Cities and Countries, they &s;ucceeded: As all the ancient general Councils, and all the antient and godly learned Fathers have allowed of Bi&s;hops, and of their Superiority over the re&s;t of the Clergy: As Bi&s;hops have been accounted generally throughout the World, to be the Apo&s;tles Suc|ce&s;&s;ors, and have continued in the Church ever &s;ince the Apo&s;tles Time: As there was never any one of all the ancient Fathers, nor any learn|ed Men for 1500 Years, but <HI>Aerius</HI> the Here|tic, that ever held that there ought to be no Difference betwixt a Bi&s;hop and a Prie&s;t, &amp;c.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Survey</HI> of the <HI>pretended holy Di&s;cipline,</HI> p. 143, apud Maddox.</NOTE></Q>

<P>I WILL not detain the Reader with a particular Defence of Hooker, as being epi&s;copal in the Sen&s;e of the <HI>Appeal.</HI>
<Q>His immortal Work the <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Polity</HI></Q>
is in many Hands, and his Principles are well known. As to the Pa&s;&s;ages

quoted to prove the contrary, they were in An&s;wer to the above mentioned <HI>Maxim</HI> of the Puritans, as is evident from the whole <HI>third Book:</HI> and there|fore what has been &s;aid in the Ca&s;e of Whitgift, is equally applicable to Hooker. In other Places, where he has no immediate Reference to that Con|trover&s;y, he clearly and &s;trongly expre&s;&s;es his Be|lief of the divine In&s;titution and Obligation of e|pi&s;copal Government.
<Q>A Bi&s;hop, &s;ays he, is a Mini&s;ter <HI>of God,</HI> unto whom with <HI>permanent Continuance,</HI> there is given not only Power of admini&s;tering the Word and Sacraments, which Power other Pre&s;byters have; but al&s;o a <HI>far|ther</HI> Power to <HI>ordain</HI> eccle&s;ia&s;tical Per&s;ons, and a Power of <HI>Chiefty in Government</HI> over Pre&s;by|ters as well as Laymen, a Power to be by Way of Juri&s;diction, <HI>a Pa&s;tor even to Pa&s;tors them|&s;elves</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Polity,</HI> Lib. vii.

And he concludes the Section with the&s;e memorable Words:
<Q>Wherefore let us not fear to be herein <HI>bold</HI> and <HI>peremptory,</HI> that if any Thing in the Church's Government, &s;urely the <HI>fir&s;t In&s;titution</HI> of Bi&s;hops was <HI>from Heaven,</HI> was even <HI>of God</HI>; the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t was the Author of it.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THE Doctor had al&s;o argued that <HI>Reordination was not practi&s;ed</HI> in the Church of England <HI>before
<PB N="74" REF="012007_0081_0F89411A6E147688">

Among other Things I &s;aid, that it was an e&s;tabli&s;hed Law from the very Beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Reign, that none &s;hould be admitted as lawful Mi|ni&s;ters in the Church of England without epi&s;copal Ordination; u&s;ing the very Words of the Preface to the Ordinal, and meaning the <HI>Act of Uniformity</HI> which e&s;tabli&s;hed the Book of Common-Prayer and all that it contained. The Doctor replies, p. 55, <HI>this is &s;aid in direct Contradiction</HI> to the Act of 13 <HI>Elizabeth</HI>; from which he gives an imperfect and unfair Extract, that it may furni&s;h him with a Pretence of &s;aying &s;omething in Oppo&s;ition to me. That one Act of that Reign was contradictory to another, without a De&s;ign of repealing it, ought not to be &s;uppo&s;ed without good Evidence; and it is not denied, that the E&s;tabli&s;hment I refered to was made. But it might much more plau&s;ibly have been objected, after the Example of Bi&s;hop Bonner, that the Act of Uniformity, although it in general e&s;tabli&s;hed the Book of Common-Prayer, yet took no particular Notice of the Ordinal, which many of our Acts of Parliament di&s;tingui&s;h as a different Book. However, could it be proved that the Preface to, or other Parts of, the Ordinal re|ceived no legal Force from the Act of Uniformity; yet it had the Support of <HI>Art.</HI> xxxvi. in 1562; and there was an Act in the 8th of <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> that par|ticularly injoined,
<Q>that &s;uch Order and Form for the Con&s;ecration of Archbi&s;hops and Bi&s;hops, and for the making of Prie&s;ts, Deacons and Mi|ni&s;ters, as was &s;et forth in the Time of the late King <HI>Edward</HI> the Sixth, and authori&s;ed by Par|liament in the Fifth and Sixth Years of the &s;aid

<P>THAT the Reader may judge, whether what is here ordered was repealed, or contradicted, or con|travened by the Doctor's Act of 13 <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> I will give an Extract of &s;o much of that Act as relates to the Subject before us, &s;upplying the material Omi&s;&s;ions in his Quotation of the &s;ame Pa&s;&s;age, which, that they may be di&s;tingui&s;hed, are printed in <HI>Italics.</HI>
<Q>Be it enacted&mdash;that every Per|&s;on under the Degree of a Bi&s;hop, which doth or &s;hall pretend to be a Prie&s;t, or Mini&s;ter of God's holy Word and Sacraments, by Rea&s;on of any other Form of In&s;titution, Con&s;ecration or ordering, than the Form &s;et forth by Parlia|ment in the Time of the late King&mdash;or now u&s;ed in the Reign of our mo&s;t gracious &s;overeign Lady, <HI>before the Fea&s;t of the Nativity of Chri&s;t next following,</HI> &s;hall in the Pre&s;ence of the Bi|&s;hop &mdash;declare his A&s;&s;ent, and &s;ub&s;cribe to all the Articles of Religion&mdash;and &s;hall bring from &s;uch Bi&s;hop&mdash;in writing, under his Seal authen|tic a Te&s;timonial of &s;uch A&s;&s;ent and Sub&s;crip|tion &mdash;upon Pain that every &s;uch Per&s;on <HI>which &s;hall not before the &s;aid Fea&s;t do as is appointed,</HI> &s;hall be (ip&s;o Facto) deprived<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Codex,</HI> p. 396, and Sparrows Collection, p. 118.</NOTE>.</Q>
The Doctor &s;ays that this Act, meaning this particular Clau&s;e of it, <HI>continued in Force till</HI> Charles II; whereas it is evident, beyond Contradiction, from the Words he endeavoured to conceal, that it was to
<PB N="76" REF="012007_0083_0F89411BEE53AE20">
have no Force, and could have none, after
<Q>the Fea&s;t of the Nativity of Chri&s;t next following</Q>
the Time of its pa&s;&s;ing. He al&s;o &s;ays <HI>it is a full Proof that it was not her</HI> (Queen <HI>Elizabeth's) Opi|nion that Ordination was, by divine Appointment, appropriated to Bi&s;hops in Di&s;tinction from Pre&s;byters, &s;o that Ordination by Pre&s;byters only was invalid</HI>: Whereas there is no Appearance of its having any Relation to the Validity, or Invalidity, of Ordina|tion by Pre&s;byters. The De&s;ign of it was chiefly to provide for &s;uch Clergymen, as had received epi&s;copal Ordination according to the popi&s;h Or|dinal, in the Reign of Queen <HI>Mary</HI>; with a farther View to &s;uch as might have received, what was e&s;teemed a valid, Ordination abroad. But what was e&s;teemed a valid Ordination, is neither &s;aid nor implied. The Act does not provide that <HI>all,</HI> who had received any Kind of Ordination, other|wi&s;e than by the e&s;tabli&s;hed Ordinal, &s;hould be made capable of holding Preferment; but that none, ordained otherwi&s;e, without qualifying them&s;elves in the Manner pre&s;cribed, &s;hould be admitted as &s;uch.
<Q>Whether tho&s;e ordained by foreign Pro|te&s;tants, where Nece&s;&s;ity, not Choice, made it impo&s;&s;ible to have epi&s;copal Ordination, were (qualified to hold Benefices) this Act doth not &s;ay. And &s;uppo&s;ing the fir&s;t Paragraph be un|der&s;tood to indulge &s;uch till the Chri&s;tmas fol|lowing, upon &s;ub&s;cribing, and after that Period to refu&s;e them: On this &s;uppo&s;ition, the Rejection being perpetual, and the Indulgence only for a &s;hort Term, the Act is rather again&s;t the foreign prote&s;tant Ordination, as not valid in this Church&dagger;:</Q>
And con&s;equently, however Whittingham might have availed him&s;elf of the
<PB N="77" REF="012007_0084_0F89411CAD1F0298">
Indulgence, Travers, who was too late, could re|ceive no Benefit from the Act.</P>
<P>THE Subject of the King's Supremacy was the next in Cour&s;e; but as the Doctor choo&s;es to con|&s;ider it in another Place, I &s;hall not object, as I am not di&s;po&s;ed to contend with him for Trifles. He gives here, p. 57, an Extract from Burn's <HI>Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical Law,</HI> under the Title <HI>Supremacy,</HI> which, without being fir&s;t garbled according to his u&s;ual Manner, he knew could not an&s;wer his Purpo&s;e; of which I &s;hall take no farther Notice.</P>
<P><Q>SHOULD it now be a&s;ked, what is all this to the Bu&s;ine&s;s of an American Epi&s;copate? My An&s;wer is, I know not, but perhaps Dr. Chauncy does.</Q>
This Ob&s;ervation was made in the <HI>Appeal defended,</HI> after I had rambled from the main Point 50 or 60 Pages in Pur&s;uit of my Opponent, who ought, if any one, to have been able to a&s;&s;ign &s;ufficient Rea|&s;ons for it, as he alone was the Cau&s;e of the Devi|ation. It was my Bu&s;ine&s;s, as Matters were circum&s;tanced, to attend upon him through all his Aberrations; and Duty required me, as well as I could, to defend the Church of England again&s;t all his Attacks, which I had very unde&s;ignedly occa&s;ioned. The &s;ame Ob&s;ervation I have too much Rea&s;on to repeat, at this Time. I have been long pre&s;&s;ing forward, but have not yet been able to come to the main Point in Di&s;pute.

The Doctor allows what was &s;aid on the Subject to be even <HI>&s;elf-evident,</HI> p. 58; but then he contends that it is no Proof of the Point, becau&s;e it was rai&s;ed upon a bad Foundation. For I had <HI>taken for granted, that Authority, if conveyed</HI> MEDI|ATELY, <HI>mu&s;t be conveyed by</HI> PERSONAL SUCCESSION, which ought, it &s;eems, fir&s;t to have been proved. He &s;ays farther; <HI>I can a&s;&s;ure him&mdash;it is the Opinion of the non-epi&s;copalian Coloni&s;ts, that the Power of perpetuating the Mini&s;tration of the Word and Go&s;pel Ordinances, is &s;o lodged with the Chri&s;tian Churches, that, whenever the Ca&s;e requires it, they can begin a Succe&s;&s;ion</HI> de novo, <HI>which Succe&s;&s;ion will be as truly ve&s;ted with Authority from Chri&s;t, as if it had been uninterruptedly handed down from the Apo&s;tles:</HI> And he pretends that Hooker was of the &s;ame Opinion. I &s;hall not &s;pend Time in inquiring whether the Sen&s;e of the <HI>non-epi&s;copalian Coloni&s;ts</HI> is truly repre|&s;ented in the&s;e Words, or not. I could ea&s;ily prove, that &s;everal of their mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible Writers have thought otherwi&s;e; but it is enough for the pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e, that what is here expre&s;&s;ed is the <HI>Doctor</HI>'s Opinion, on which Account only an Examination of it in this Place is nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>HE readily allows that
<Q>none have Authority in the Chri&s;tian Church, but tho&s;e who derive it from Chri&s;t, either mediately, or immediately.</Q>
An <HI>im|mediate</HI> Conveyance of eccle&s;ia&s;tical Authority from Chri&s;t, we have at pre&s;ent no Concern with. We are only to inquire, in what Manner that Power, which Chri&s;t formerly be&s;towed for the Edification of his Church, can <HI>now</HI> be obtained, for tho&s;e
<PB N="79" REF="012007_0086_0F89411E2D928100">
Purpo&s;es for which it was then granted. Now, I think it will not be di&s;puted, that <HI>wherever</HI> that Power was lodged, from <HI>thence</HI> it mu&s;t be received, if it be received at all. The mo&s;t material Que&s;tion then is, to whom was this Power originally com|mitted by Chri&s;t? It will be &s;aid by &s;ome, that it was given to the Church. In one Sen&s;e this is true; as whatever is given to any Members of a Society, for the general Benefit of that Society, may be &s;aid to be given to the Society. But if we examine the original Grant of eccle&s;ia&s;tical Power, it will appear, that it was not made to the Church diffu&s;ively, but to certain Per&s;ons, under who&s;e Care and Government the Church was immediately placed. Tho&s;e Per&s;ons, who undoubtedly under|&s;tood what Authority they received, proceeded forthwith to exerci&s;e it, in Di&s;charge of the great Tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them. Now the whole Conduct of the Apo&s;tles nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;es and implies, that the Government of the Church here on earth was left <HI>intirely</HI> in their Hands. The Acknowledgement and Submi&s;&s;ion of all Chri&s;tians al&s;o prove the &s;ame Point. As, on the one Hand, the Apo&s;tles made Laws for the Government of the Church; &s;o we find, on the other, that tho&s;e Laws were univer|&s;ally obeyed. All di&s;puted Matters were referred to their Deci&s;ion, from which there was no Appeal. In &s;hort, they exerci&s;ed, in the Name of Chri&s;t, an uncontroulable Authority in the Church; and, as Occa&s;ions required, they appointed particular Per&s;ons to act as &s;ubordinate Mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>LET the Ca&s;e be carefully and clo&s;ely examined, and, I think, there can be no Difficulty in deter|mining, whether, in the fir&s;t In&s;tance, the Autho|rity of Chri&s;t was lodged in the Hands of the
<PB N="80" REF="012007_0087_0F89411EEDE6CF08">
Apo&s;tles only and exclu&s;ively, &s;o that none could act as Officers or Mini&s;ters without their Con&s;ent and Appointment: Or, whether it was lodged in the Church diffu&s;ively, in &s;uch a Manner, that the Members of it, met together in a popular A&s;&s;em|bly, might reject or di&s;place an Apo&s;tle, and put another in his Stead, by Virtue of the Commi&s;&s;ion given by Chri&s;t. If the whole Power at <HI>this</HI> Time is allowed to have been in the Hands of the Apo&s;tles, it will go very far towards deciding the Matter in Di&s;pute. For <HI>when</HI> was this original Con&s;titution altered, and <HI>who</HI> had a Right to alter it? Who could reduce that, which Chri&s;t had formed into a regular Society, with proper Officers to govern it, from an organi&s;ed Body into a confu|&s;ed Ma&s;s? To &s;ay that the Apo&s;tles could make this Alteration, is to a&s;cribe to them a very extra|ordinary Power, without any Shadow of Evidence that they ever had it&mdash;a Power, which implies that they were better Judges of what was a proper Con&s;titution for &s;uch a Society as the Chri&s;tian Church, than the divine Founder him&s;elf. But &s;uppo&s;ing them to have had &s;uch a Power, <HI>when,</HI> and <HI>on what Occa&s;ion,</HI> did they exert it? Where is the Proof, where are the Records, of this remark|able Event? But, on the other Hand, if the very Nature of Things, and every Monument remaining te&s;tify again&s;t it, as they certainly do; we may be a&s;&s;ured, that the Con&s;titution of the Church was the &s;ame when the Apo&s;tles left it, as when they were at fir&s;t intru&s;ted with the Care of it. And if it was not changed by them, and they had no Power to change it, any more than Aaron could change the primitive Con&s;titution of the Jewi&s;h Church; whether others, &s;ince their Time, can have had &s;uch a Power, may &s;afely be left for
<PB N="81" REF="012007_0088_0F89411FAE21B528">
common Sen&s;e to decide. To this may be added, that if the original Con&s;titution of the Church has been altered, it is &s;o far another Society, and not the &s;ame that was founded by Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>WHERE a Society is con&s;tituted under a particular Form of Government, and de&s;igned for Continu|ance, it is e&s;&s;ential to it, that the Officers have a Power of perpetuating them&s;elves, by appointing Succe&s;&s;ors, if they are not particularly appointed by the Founder of the Society. This was evi|dently the Ca&s;e of the Chri&s;tian Church, if we may judge from the Practice of the Apo&s;tles. Where they were pre&s;ent, none received eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal Authority, but immediately from them. In di&s;tant Places, none received, or could receive, &s;uch Authority, but from tho&s;e Per&s;ons whom they had duly authorized to impart it. Upon this Maxim Timothy was &s;ent to Ephe&s;us by St. Paul, and Titus was left in Crete, to ordain Elders in every City.</P>
<P>THE Chri&s;tian Church was thus originally con&s;ti|tuted under Officers of divine Appointment, as evidently as the Jewi&s;h Church was; and Chri&s;tians, in the Time of the Apo&s;tles, had no more Right to &s;et up an Authority different from theirs, or in Oppo&s;ition to it, than the I&s;raelites had, in the Rebellion of Korah, to gain&s;ay Mo&s;es and Aaron in the&s;e very <HI>popular</HI> Words:
<Q>Ye take too much upon you, &s;eeing <HI>all the Congregation are holy,</HI> every one of them, and <HI>the Lord is among them</HI>; wherefore then lift you up your&s;elves above the Congregation of the Lord?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 paragraph"></NOTE></Q>
Let it now be ob&s;erved, that what were the Rights of Chri&s;tians
<PB N="82" REF="012007_0089_0F8941206CAE6E48">
in the Apo&s;tles Days, the very &s;ame, neither more nor le&s;s, are the Rights of Chri&s;tians at this Day. If therefore the Church at Ephe&s;us, for In&s;tance, could not ordain Elders, without, or in Oppo&s;i|tion to, the Authority given to Timothy; neither can the Church now, in any Country, ordain Mi|ni&s;ters, without, or in Oppo&s;ition to, the Authority of tho&s;e, who are in the &s;ame Station that Timothy was<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>non-epi&s;copalian Coloni&s;ts,</HI> it &s;eems, claim, in Neglect or rather in Defiance of the Authority above-mentioned, a Power to ordain, and to begin a Succe&s;&s;ion <HI>de novo.</HI> This Claim, I &s;uppo&s;e, is founded in the Privileges given <HI>in common</HI> to all Chri&s;tians, and not in the Privileges given to &s;ome Chri&s;tians in Preference to others. But the common Privileges of Chri&s;tians are equal in all, in male and female, bond and free; for the Go&s;pel knows nothing of the&s;e Di&s;tinctions. Now whatever power is exerci&s;ed by a Body of Per&s;ons who are equal in Authority, mu&s;t be exerci&s;ed by the Direction of the Majority, to which the minor Part mu&s;t &s;ubmit. Sup|po&s;ing then an A&s;&s;embly of Chri&s;tians to be called together for the Bu&s;ine&s;s of beginning a Succe&s;&s;ion <HI>de novo</HI>: As no Chri&s;tians can be excluded, the Voices and Rights of all being equal, it may happen that the Women amount to a Majority, and agree in an Opinion different from that of the Men. I would a&s;k the Doctor, whether the Act of the Wo|men, thus circum&s;tanced, can produce the Ordination intend|ed? If he &s;ays <HI>no,</HI> he mu&s;t renounce his Principle, and that of the <HI>non-epi&s;copalian Coloni&s;ts.</HI> But indeed I have long ob&s;erved, that this Doctrine of eccle&s;ia&s;tical Authority lodged in the People, is only u&s;ed for Convenience on particular Occa&s;ions, and that it is &s;eldom or never made the Rule of Practice. Accordingly, in Church-Meetings for the Purpo&s;e of Di&s;cipline, &amp;c. among the <HI>non-epi&s;copalian Coloni&s;ts,</HI> the Women are not con&s;ulted; they appear not by Proxy; al|though they are generally as good Chri&s;tians as the Men, and have an equal Right to direct in the&s;e Matters; but the Men <HI>u&s;urp</HI> all that Right to them&s;elves, in which, by their own Principles, they have but an equal Share.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>FROM what has been &s;aid it appears, that in the Apo&s;tles Time, and con&s;equently at this Day, the
<PB N="83" REF="012007_0090_0F8941218E97E2B8">
Authority to govern and order the Church, which was lodged in the Hands of particular Per&s;ons, and not in the Body diffu&s;ive, could be derived in the fir&s;t In&s;tance, in no other Way than by <HI>per&s;onal</HI> Communication; and in after In&s;tances, could, and can be derived from the Apo&s;ties in no other Way than by <HI>per&s;onal Succe&s;&s;ion,</HI> in a Line that has never been interrupted. By <HI>per&s;onal Succe&s;&s;ion</HI> is here meant a Succe&s;&s;ion of particular Per&s;ons in the Government of the Church, to whom the Power of Ordination has been regularly conveyed, by tho&s;e that have regularly received it, in this Manner, from the Apo&s;tles them&s;elves; and by its being <HI>uninterrupted</HI> is meant, that throughout the Succe&s;&s;ion, eccle&s;ia&s;tical Authority has been handed down by tho&s;e who were duly authori&s;ed to convey it.</P>
<P>THE Point which was <HI>taken for granted</HI> before, is now, I tru&s;t, &s;ufficiently proved. If the Reader is of the &s;ame Opinion, let him take Notice, that Doctor Chauncy allows, p. 58, that it is <HI>the only Thing that needed Proof,</HI> and that, upon this Prin|ciple, the Nece&s;&s;ity of an <HI>uninterrupted Succe&s;&s;ion</HI> is <HI>&s;elf-evident.</HI> I have therefore no Need to enlarge farther on the Subject. I can freely tru&s;t what has been now &s;aid, in Conjunction with what was for|merly offered, to the Judgment of every Reader that is not gro&s;sly partial.</P>
<P>THE Doctor has a Number of other Ob&s;erva|tions relating to the Subject of an uninterrupted Succe&s;&s;ion, and many other Objections again&s;t what was &s;aid in Favour of it, but they appear to me to be but of little Con&s;equence. His Quota|tion from Hooker, is introduced in &s;uch a Man|ner

With the like Liberties, a Man may undertake to prove any Thing from any Writer.&mdash;As to what may be done in Ca&s;es of Nece&s;&s;ity, it will be Time enough to con&s;ider it, when the Nece&s;&s;ity happens. We know that Nece&s;&s;ity never could be pleaded by the Di&s;&s;enters at home, and their <HI>non-epi&s;copalian</HI> Bre|thren in the Colonies are <HI>anti-epi&s;copal</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Author of a <HI>critical Commentary</HI> on A.

This Promi&s;e therefore is a &s;ufficient Security, that the Succe&s;&s;ion in Que&s;|tion has not been, and &s;hall not be, interrupted. Be&s;ides,
<Q>it is incumbent on the Objectors to prove,</Q>
that the Interruption has happened; for until this be proved, the Pre&s;umption will be that it never has. Indeed it appears from the very Na|ture of Things morally impo&s;&s;ible that it ever &s;hould have happened. For it has been the Doc|trine of the Church in all Ages, that no Ordina|tion
<PB N="85" REF="012007_0092_0F8941236CF074A0">
was effectual, but what was performed by Bi&s;hops. This has been a perpetual Guard to the Succe&s;&s;ion contended for, becau&s;e no Ordination would be accepted of, but &s;uch as was thought to be valid.&mdash;The&s;e <HI>Hints</HI> are offered as a &s;ufficient An&s;wer to all that is &s;aid in the Doctor'<HI>s Reply,</HI> from p. 59 to p. 65.</P>
<P>IN his former Pamphlet he had endeavoured, in the Words of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enting Gentleman,</HI> to prove the Church of England to be incon&s;i&s;tent and ab|&s;urd, in maintaining the Validity of Orders de|rived through the Church of Rome, while &s;he is called in the <HI>Homilies,</HI> "an old withered Harlot," &amp;c. To this I thought it &s;ufficient to oppo&s;e that Part of Mr. White's Reply to that <HI>Gentleman,</HI> where he &s;ays:
<Q>If I mu&s;t derive my &s;piritual Pedigree from a Harlot, I had rather it &s;hould be <HI>an old withered one,</HI> of an antient and honour|able Line, than a <HI>young Strumpet</HI> of no Name and Family, and who came into the World but ye&s;terday.</Q>
This, I confe&s;s, is rather ludi|crou&s;ly &s;aid; however, a more &s;erious An&s;wer was &s;carcely de&s;erved. The Doctor replies, that in both Ca&s;es we mu&s;t be <HI>born of Fornication. Is it po&s;&s;ible,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>a Whore, a foul, filthy Whore, &s;hould, being an Adultre&s;s, bring forth any other than a ba&s;e-born, &s;purious Race?</HI> A <HI>real</HI> Whore, while &s;he continues &s;uch, cannot; but perhaps a <HI>metaphorical</HI> Whore may. The Church of Rome is called a <HI>Harlot</HI> in the Homilies, in Conformity to the Language of Scripture. The Jews were &s;aid to "play the <HI>Harlot,</HI>" and to
<Q>go a <HI>whor|ing</HI> after their own Inventions,</Q>
when they cor|rupted their Religion with a Mixture of idolatrous Rites and Practices. In the New Te&s;tament we
<PB N="86" REF="012007_0093_0F8941242CDF1F20">
read of
<Q>the great <HI>Whore</HI> which did corrupt the Earth with her <HI>Fornication</HI>;</Q>
by which
<Q>great Whore</Q>
is intended, in the Opinion of mo&s;t Commentators, either Rome Heathen, or Rome Chri&s;tian. In &s;peaking therefore of the Church of Rome, and her &s;uper&s;titious and idolatrous Corruption of Chri&s;tianity, at a Time when the Nation was &s;till &s;marting under the Wounds re|ceived from her galling Yoke, it was very natural for the Compo&s;ers of the Homilies, and not im|proper, to call her a <HI>Harlot</HI>; in the Sen&s;e wherein the Jewi&s;h Church was &s;o called by the Prophets. But they never intended to &s;ignify that her Mini|&s;trations were invalid; for they knew, that, at the Time of her Whoredoms, the Sacrifices and other Mini&s;trations in the Jewi&s;h Church, when duly performed, were effectual to tho&s;e Ends for which they were appointed. They were far from adopt|ing the Opinion of the ancient <HI>Donati&s;ts</HI> in the&s;e Matters; and what they believed of Churches and Bi&s;hops, of corrupt Principles and Practices, we may judge from what they believed of <HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> in &s;uch a Ca&s;e. Tho&s;e that compo&s;ed the Homilies, were &s;oon after employed in framing what are called King <HI>Edward</HI>'s ARTICLES; in one of which they &s;ay:
<Q>Although in the vi&s;ible Church the evil be ever mingled with the good, and &s;ometime the evil have chief Authority in the Mini&s;tration of the Word and Sacraments: Yet for as much as they do not the &s;ame in their own Name, but do mini&s;ter by <HI>Chri&s;t's Commi&s;&s;ion and Authority,</HI> we may u&s;e their Mini&s;try, both in hearing the Word of God, and in the receiving the Sacra|ments. Neither is the Effect of God's Ordi|nances taken away by their Wickedne&s;s, nor the Grace of God's Gifts dimini&s;hed from &s;uch, as
<PB N="87" REF="012007_0094_0F894124F27A9798">
by Faith rightly receive the Sacraments mini&s;ter|ed unto them, <HI>which be effectual, becau&s;e of Chri&s;t's In&s;titution and Promi&s;e, although they be mini&s;tered by evil Men.</HI></Q>
It need not be added, that this is equally applicable to Ordination by a popi&s;h Bi&s;hop.</P>
<P>WERE it worth the Reader's Attention, I could &s;hew that the Doctor is much mi&s;taken in his Opinion of the Sentiments of Archbi&s;hop U&s;her and Bi&s;hop Burnet concerning Epi&s;copacy, and that he judges from partial and imperfect Evi|dence. Enough, I believe, was &s;aid of U&s;her, for the impartial Reader's Satisfaction in the <HI>Appeal defended</HI>; but as the Doctor &s;eems to require far|ther Satisfaction, I mu&s;t refer him to a Book written in An&s;wer to Dr. Bernard's, intitled, <HI>Re&s;|pondet Petrus,</HI> by Dr. Heylin. As to Burnet, it is &s;ufficient that he affirms in his Expo&s;ition,
<Q>that Chri&s;t appointed a Succe&s;&s;ion of Pa&s;tors, in different Ranks, to be continued in the Church for the Work of the Go&s;pel, and the Care of Souls; and that as the Apo&s;tles &s;ettled the Churches, <HI>they appointed different</HI> ORDERS, <HI>of Bi&s;hops, Prie&s;ts and Deacons</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">On <HI>Art.</HI> xxv.</NOTE>:</Q>

But, that after the Time of writing his <HI>Vindication of the Church of Scotland,</HI> which I have not &s;een, he was truly <HI>epi&s;copal</HI> in his Principles, in the full Heighth and Depth of the Expre&s;&s;ion, I may ap|peal,
<PB N="88" REF="012007_0095_0F894125AE486B50">
not only to particular Pa&s;&s;ages, but to the whole Tenor of his &s;ub&s;equent Writings.</P>
<P>IT is an ea&s;y Thing, by the Help of &s;ingle Sen|tences, with here and there Scraps of Sentences, artfully arranged and properly managed, to prove almo&s;t any Authors to be, what we choo&s;e they &s;hould be. In &s;uch a Way, I could ea&s;ily prove Dr. Chauncy him&s;elf to be an Epi&s;copalian, from the Pamphlet before me. I could collect Sentences, wherein he acknowledges the fundamental Prin|ciples of an uninterrupted Succe&s;&s;ion of Bi&s;hops to be <HI>&s;elf evident.</HI> I could &s;hew that he is an Advocate for the Sentiments of Whitgift, Bancroft, Hooker, U&s;her, Burnet, and a great Majority, <HI>nineteen in twenty of the Members of the Church of England,</HI> relating to the Subject, which are noto|riou&s;ly epi&s;copal&mdash;that he is &s;o convinced of the U&s;efulne&s;s and Nece&s;&s;ity of an <HI>American Epi&s;copate,</HI> that he is not only willing that it &s;hould be e&s;tab|li&s;hed, but blames the Clergy of the Church of England in the Colonies for not having exerted them&s;elves more in Order to procure Bi&s;hops, and thinks they &s;hould have applied for them to the Moravians, or even to the Papi&s;ts in Canada, ra|ther than be without them. But &s;uch an Amu&s;ement I will not pur&s;ue, as it would interfere too much with Bu&s;ine&s;s, and be too great a Tre&s;pa&s;s upon the Reader's Indulgence. For the&s;e two Rea&s;ons I &s;hall take no farther Notice of what he &s;ays con|cerning U&s;her and Burnet, but &s;eek for more u&s;eful Employment in his next <HI>Section.</HI></P>
<P>HERE my Opponent begins thus: <HI>The Doctor has &s;een fit, for Rea&s;ons</HI> BEST KNOWN TO HIMSELF, <HI>to pa&s;s over almo&s;t every Thing this</HI> (&s;econd) <HI>Section

relates to, that was material,</HI> p. 57. But the Rea&s;ons for my doing this are as well known to the Reader, as to my &s;elf. The Pa&s;&s;age, in which he was informed of the&s;e Rea&s;ons, mu&s;t have been immediately under the Doctor's Eye when he made the Remark, as it &s;tands in the Front of the Section, to which he was preparing to reply. What was there &s;aid, is in the&s;e Words:
<Q>The Objections that have been made to the &s;econd Section of the <HI>Appeal,</HI> wherein the Powers peculiar to the epi&s;co|pal Office are &s;hewn, as they relate chiefly to the Evidence of Scripture, explained by the Practice of the primitive Church, &s;o far &s;hall be pa&s;&s;ed over, they coming not within the Intention of the pre&s;ent Defence.</Q>
Why this was not within the Intention of my Defence, was carefully explained in p. 77, and the Rea&s;ons there a&s;&s;igned have ap|peared to be abundantly &s;atisfactory to the Public. What can we now think of the Fairne&s;s and Candor of &s;uch a Remark?</P>
<P>IN di&s;cour&s;ing of the Nature of the epi&s;copal Office, it was thought proper to di&s;tingui&s;h, between tho&s;e Things that belong to it originally and e&s;&s;en|tially, and &s;uch external Appendages as had been added in after Times, and which have no nece&s;&s;ary Connection with the Office it&s;elf.

<Q>Whether the Addi|tion of &s;uch Appendages be rea&s;onable or unrea|&s;onable, is nothing to me; and, which is more, it is nothing to the Ca&s;e of &s;uch an Epi&s;copate as is propo&s;ed for America. I had &s;aid nothing, nor was it my Bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;ay any Thing of its being

<HI>rea&s;onable</HI> that the&s;e Appendages &s;hould be added; nor was it his Bu&s;ine&s;s as an An&s;werer to me, to &s;ay any Thing of its being <HI>unrea&s;onable.</HI> Much le&s;s was it his Bu&s;ine&s;s to object Appendages of this Kind to an Epi&s;copate, which it certainly is, and ever was intended, &s;hall exi&s;t without them *.</Q>
He now rejoins: <HI>Why then, in the Name of Wonder, did he &s;ay any Thing about the&s;e Appendages? If it was nothing to him, that is, to the Cau&s;e he is de|fending, and nothing to the Ca&s;e of an American Epi&s;copate, it is certainly to no Purpo&s;e to &s;ay a Word about them,</HI> p. 72. Fair and candid again! without any Mixture of Sophi&s;try! But however, the <HI>Subject</HI> of &s;uch Appendages, and the <HI>Rea&s;ona|blene&s;s</HI> of making them, are different Things. In the <HI>Appeal,</HI> the Appendages were di&s;tingui&s;hed from the Office it&s;elf, becau&s;e it was nece&s;&s;ary in Order rightly to conceive of the epi&s;copal Office, as propo&s;ed to be exerci&s;ed in America; and in my <HI>Defence</HI> I did not &s;ay that the <HI>Subject,</HI> or the <HI>Di&s;|tinction,</HI> was nothing to me, but that the <HI>Rea&s;ona|blene&s;s</HI> or <HI>Unrea&s;onablene&s;s</HI> of adding &s;uch Appen|dages to the epi&s;copal Office, was neither my Bu&s;ine&s;s, nor his, to con&s;ider. How then, <HI>in the Name of Wonder,</HI> could Dr. Chauncy &s;hew &s;o little Regard to his own literary Character!</P>
<P>IN explaining the Nature of the epi&s;copal Office it was ob&s;erved, that the Office is exactly the &s;ame in a large Dioce&s;s as in a &s;mall one, and that this Circum&s;tance affected not the Validity of any Act performed by the Bi&s;hop. The Doctor an&s;wered, that if the Validity of the Bi&s;hop's Acts is not affected by the Largene&s;s of his Dioce&s;s, his Capa|city to &s;erve it undoubtedly is. It was &s;aid in Reply
<PB N="91" REF="012007_0098_0F894127EE599DA8">
to him, the An&s;wer amounts to this,
<Q>that although what I &s;aid is allowed to be true, yet &s;omething that I did not &s;ay is certainly fal&s;e. The Thing which I did not &s;ay is, that the Bi&s;hop is <HI>as able</HI> to &s;erve the great Ends of his Office in a large Dioce&s;s as in a &s;mall one.</Q>
Let us now hear the Doctor's Rejoinder. <HI>It is true, he did not &s;ay this; but it is as true, that it was with Propriety, and</HI> IRRESISTIBLE FORCE <HI>that I &s;aid it,</HI> p. 72. What|ever Opinion my Opponent may have of the IRRESISTIBILITY of his own <HI>Force,</HI> in this In&s;tance it was certainly mi&s;applied. Nor could there be any <HI>Propriety</HI> in an <HI>An&s;werer</HI>'s thus &s;hifting the Que&s;tion, from the Validity of an Act, to the Capacity of the Agent.</P>
<P>IT was farther &s;aid in Reply to him, that he was al&s;o wrong in his Opinion relating to the Bi&s;hop's <HI>Capacity</HI> of taking due Care of a large Dioce&s;s, as he judged
<Q>of the epi&s;copal Charge upon Con|gregational Principles, confounding the Office of a Bi&s;hop with that of a Pari&s;h Mini&s;ter.</Q>
He &s;till in&s;i&s;ts upon it, that it is <HI>highly improper, and an intolerable Grievance, that Bi&s;hops &s;hould be at the Head of large Dioce&s;&s;es; becau&s;e it de&s;troys their Capacity to &s;erve the Ends, de&s;igned by Chri&s;t in the In&s;titution of their Office.</HI> This confirms the Ob|&s;ervation I made upon his wrong Method of pro|ceeding. He believes the De&s;ign of the <HI>In&s;titution</HI> of Bi&s;hops was, that they &s;hould take the &s;piritual Charge of &s;ingle Congregations, and perform the parochial Duties. Accordingly he looks upon him&s;elf to be a proper Bi&s;hop, agreeably to the In&s;titution of Chri&s;t. In this Sen&s;e, it is confe&s;&s;ed, Bi&s;hops ought to be confined to narrow Di&s;tricts, as their Incapacity to &s;erve large ones, &s;uch as
<PB N="92" REF="012007_0099_0F893F85709B9A80">
common Dioce&s;&s;es, cannot be di&s;puted. But the Bi&s;hops in Que&s;tion are an ORDER of Men very different from that of <HI>Bi&s;hop Chauncy,</HI> and the Ends of their Office are as different as their Order. Parochial Duties they may occa&s;ionally perform; but the proper Bu&s;ine&s;s of their Office is, Ordi|nation, the Superintendency and Government of the Clergy, and Confirmation. Now if a Dioce&s;s is not &s;o large but that a Bi&s;hop can duly perform all the&s;e Offices, it cannot be ju&s;tly objected that he has not a <HI>Capacity</HI> to &s;erve it. In an epi&s;copal Church the Number of Pari&s;h Mini&s;ters is as great as it would be, if the epi&s;copal Order had no Exi&s;tence; and the Addition of Bi&s;hops to &s;uper-intend the parochial Clergy and oblige them to perform their Duty, is &s;o far from being <HI>an intole|rable Grievance,</HI> that &s;uch an In&s;titution, in its Nature and De&s;ign, is an invaluable Advantage. Here the Doctor quotes and mi&s;applies our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour's Declaration,
<Q>my Kingdom is not of this World;</Q>
which has no more Relation to the Subject under Con&s;ideration, than the&s;e Words of Mo&s;es,
<Q>In the Beginning God created the Heavens and the Earth.</Q></P>
<P>I SHALL not &s;pend much Time in controverting what he &s;ays about <HI>Aerius</HI> and <HI>Colluthus.</HI> The&s;e I had repre&s;ented to have been
<Q>the fir&s;t Contri|vers of Ordination by Pre&s;byters;</Q>
but herein I may have been mi&s;taken, as I find the learned Dr. Lee points out an In&s;tance of the like Nature, among the <HI>Montani&s;ts,</HI> in the latter End of the &s;econd Century, of one <HI>Bla&s;tus,</HI> a Greek Pre&s;by|ter, who formed, &s;ays he,

by St. Irenaeus <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;tory of <HI>Montani&s;m.</HI> p. 137.</NOTE>. That Aerius was condemned as an Heretic,
<Q><HI>chiefly</HI> for his Opinion of the Parity of Bi&s;hops and Pre&s;byters,</Q>
is a|greeable to the Account given by all the mo&s;t con|&s;iderable eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;torians, and the Opinion of all the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Writers, that have mentioned the Ca&s;e. That Jerom, Au&s;tin, Am|bro&s;e, Sedulius, Prima&s;ius, Chry&s;o&s;tom and The|ophylact <HI>were of the &s;ame Opinion with Aerius,</HI> with Regard to the Parity of Bi&s;hops and Pre&s;by|ters, as the Doctor pretends was the Belief of <HI>Reignolds,</HI> Jewel, Bridges, Whitacre, and Stilling|fleet, whom he calls <HI>epi&s;copal Writers of the fir&s;t Figure,</HI> but &s;ome of whom were notorious Puri|tans; is, as he &s;ays in another Ca&s;e, <HI>in direct Op|po&s;ition to as known a Truth as is contained in Hi&s;tory.</HI></P>
<P>TO what was &s;aid concerning Colluthus, from the Bi&s;hops of Egypt, Thebais, Lybia and Pen|tapolis, and the Clergy of Mareotis, he oppo&s;es the eva&s;ive Di&s;tinctions of Blondel, given in the <HI>Irenicum,</HI> as a &s;ufficient and <HI>full An&s;wer.</HI> Blondel, it &s;eems, thought fit to &s;ay, <HI>the pronouncing &s;uch an Ordination</HI> (as that of I&s;chyras by Colluthus) <HI>null doth not evidence, that they looked on Ordination as belonging, of divine Right, only to Bi&s;hops.</HI> For it might, &s;ays he, have been condemned as <HI>contrary to the Canons,</HI> as not performed <HI>in the proper Dioce&s;s,</HI> as being <HI>without a Title,</HI> &amp;c. Whereas the Bi|&s;hops above-mentioned, in their <HI>&s;ynodical Epi&s;tle,</HI> &s;ay expre&s;sly, in the Extract I had given, that the Ordination was null, <HI>becau&s;e</HI> it was performed by a Pre&s;byter.
<Q>How came I&s;chyras, &s;ay they, to be a Pre&s;byter, and by whom was he ordained?
<PB N="94" REF="012007_0101_0F893F86EE72E268">
Was it by Colluthus? For that remains to be &s;aid. But Colluthus died a Pre&s;byter, SO THAT ALL <HI>the Impo&s;itions of his Hands were</HI> INVALID <HI>and</HI> NULL:</Q>
&mdash;and the Clergy of Mareotis, in their <HI>joint Letter,</HI> from which al&s;o I had given an Extract, &s;ay:
<Q>I&s;chyras who calls him&s;elf a Pre&s;|byter, is not a Pre&s;byter, &s;ince he was ordained by Colluthus, who <HI>a&s;&s;umed an imaginary Epi&s;|copacy,</HI> and was afterwards commanded by Ho|&s;ius, and other Bi&s;hops &s;ynodically a&s;&s;embled, to return to the Order of Pre&s;byters, whereto he was ordained. And CONSEQUENTLY all tho&s;e, whom Colluthus ordained, returned to their former Stations, and I&s;chyras him&s;elf became a Layman.</Q>
Let the Reader now judge, whe|ther, nothwith&s;tanding the Doctor's <HI>full An&s;wer</HI> and Proof to the contrary, the Condemnation of that Ordination was not founded on an Opinion of its e&s;&s;ential Nullity and Invalidity, becau&s;e it was performed by a Pre&s;byter, or one who a&s;&s;umed only an <HI>imaginary</HI> Epi&s;copacy.</P>
<P>IN &s;peaking of Ordination as one of the pecu|liar Branches of the epi&s;copal Office, I took No|tice there is not an In&s;tance of Ordination by Pre&s;|byters to be found in the Church for &s;everal Ages after Chri&s;t; and that Aerius and Colluthus, in the latter End of the <HI>fourth</HI> Century, were the fir&s;t that endeavoured to introduce that Kind of Ordination. The Doctor, in his <HI>An&s;wer,</HI> demand|ed <HI>one In&s;tance, within the long Period of</HI> 150 <HI>Years from Chri&s;t, of an Ordination by any Bi&s;hop.</HI> It would have been a more compleat An&s;wer to have &s;aid, that there was not an In&s;tance of epi&s;copal Or|dination to be found within the &s;ame Period that I
<PB N="95" REF="012007_0102_0F893F8894E5BF28">
had mentioned, than to &s;ay there was no &s;uch In|&s;tance within the <HI>long Period of</HI> 150 <HI>Years</HI>; which <HI>long</HI> Period was <HI>&s;horter</HI> by more than Half. How|ever, not in&s;i&s;ting upon this mo&s;t material Diffe|rence between my Period and his, I replied, that he had made the &s;ame Demand &s;ome Years before, in his <HI>Dudleian Lecture,</HI> to which a direct and for|mal An&s;wer had been given by Mr. Leaming<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In his <HI>Defence</HI> of <HI>Epi&s;copal Government.</HI></NOTE>, whereof he had not taken the lea&s;t Notice. This appeared to me to be a 'Curio&s;ity,' and indeed &s;uch as I had never met with
<Q>in the Regions of Controver&s;y.</Q>
I then gave Mr. Leaming's Re|ply, which I e&s;teemed to be a full An&s;wer to the Demand. If the Doctor him&s;elf thought other|wi&s;e, &s;till there was &s;omething <HI>curious</HI> in his tak|ing no Notice of the An&s;wer that had been <HI>at|tempted</HI> to this Challenge, when he came to re|peat it.</P>
<P>HE now &s;ays, p. 78, by Way of Excu&s;e: <HI>I did not e&s;teem it worthy of the lea&s;t Notice,</HI> OR (meaning, that he did not imagine) <HI>that any one el&s;e would, that had any con&s;iderable Degree of intellectual Di&s;|cernment.</HI> Yet in the next Words he tells us, that Mr. Welles thought it worthy of Notice, for that <HI>he nullified this produced In&s;tance, and all that was &s;aid upon it.</HI> This, by the Way, looks like treating Mr. Welles very ungenerou&s;ly, after the many kind Offices and Compliments he had received from him; as the Words fairly imply an Opinion that Mr. Welles had no <HI>con&s;iderable Degree of intel|lectual Di&s;cernment,</HI> at lea&s;t in that particular Ca&s;e. Again: He tells us he did not choo&s;e to take Notice of Mr. Leaming's An&s;wer, becau&s;e, as he informed the Public, in his Letter prefixed to Mr.
<PB N="96" REF="012007_0103_0F893F892F13BA30">
Welles's Piece, that <HI>was he inclined to engage in the epi&s;copal Controver&s;y, he &s;hould choo&s;e for his Oppo|nent, one that is better able to manage the Di&s;pute, than he appears to be.</HI> But the Dealers in public Controver&s;y have not always the Liberty of choo&s;ing their Opponents. And as to Mr. Leaming, he is well known to be abundantly able to manage the Di&s;pute about Epi&s;copacy, again&s;t any that may oppo&s;e him. This &s;ame <HI>prefixed Letter</HI> contains illiberal Reflections, upon a Gentleman of a very amiable and re&s;pectable Character. And here, as we are on the Subject of
<Q>Curio&s;ities in the Regions of Controver&s;y,</Q>
it may not be ami&s;s to point out a very remarkable one, to be found in that &s;hort Letter to Mr. Welles. Says the Doctor: I <HI>have</HI> NO OTHER KNOWLEDGE <HI>of this Gentleman</HI> (Mr. Lea|ming) <HI>than what may be collected from this &s;mall Work of his</HI> (his <HI>Defence,</HI> &amp;c.) Yet within the Di&s;tance of a &s;ingle Page he al&s;o &s;ays: <HI>by</HI> THE ACCOUNT I HAVE <HI>of</HI> Mr. Leaming, <HI>he is not equal to the Performance that comes out in his Name.</HI> But to return from this Digre&s;&s;ion in Pur&s;uit of Curi|o&s;ities.</P>
<P>THE Doctor contends that Mr. Leaming's An|&s;wer was improper, becau&s;e <HI>the Example of epi&s;copal Ordination wanted, and de&s;ired, was to be &s;elected, not from the Scripture, but from one or another of the Fathers of the Two fir&s;t Centuries.</HI> But this does not appear from the Challenge, in which there is not a Word &s;aid of tho&s;e <HI>Fathers.</HI> The <HI>Dudleian Lecturer</HI> had been &s;aying, that he could find nothing in Favour of Epi&s;copacy in the Scriptures, nor in the Fathers before Clemens of Alexandria, except a Sentence in Irenaeus, which he endeavoured to explain away. Upon this, he called upon <HI>Epi&s;co|parians
<PB N="97" REF="012007_0104_0F893F89EEF08A60">
to favour him with only one Example of epi&s;copal Ordination, in their Sen&s;e of it, within the Time above-de&s;cribed</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dud. Lect.</HI> p. 70.</NOTE>. The Demand therefore, by all the Rules of fair Con&s;truction, mu&s;t have been, to produce the Example from tho&s;e Writings wherein he was unable to find it him&s;elf; which were the Scriptures and primitive Fathers of the Church. If then Mr. Leaming was able to point out an Example in Scripture, he complied with the Demand, as directly as if he had produced it from any of tho&s;e Fathers.</P>
<P>THE Doctor argues that the Example given is not to be admitted by him, becau&s;e &s;uch an Example would, on our Side, be rejected. For if, in An|&s;wer to a Declaration in the <HI>Appeal</HI> that no In&s;tances of Pre&s;byterian Ordination are to be found in the Church for &s;everal Ages, he had replied, in Words like tho&s;e of Mr. Leaming; that he could produce many, but for brevity Sake he would mention but one In&s;tance, viz. The Ordination of Timothy, by "the laying on of the Hands of the Pre&s;bytery," <HI>producing only tho&s;e Arguments that had been u&s;ed a Hundred Times over, in Support of it</HI>; he imagines he &s;hould be <HI>laughed at</HI> by <HI>the Doctor, and that convened Body which fir&s;t put him upon writing.</HI> But a Man is &s;eldom laughed at for producing Argu|ments, notwith&s;tanding they may have been u&s;ed frequently, provided they are produced and applied properly. Good Arguments will wear a long while, and not be the wor&s;e for it. But when a Man u&s;es Arguments that have been <HI>refuted</HI> a Hundred Times over, in Oppo&s;ition to plain Facts, and the &s;ettled Belief of the Church for 1500 Years; I will not an&s;wer for my&s;elf, nor am I authori&s;ed to
<PB N="98" REF="012007_0105_0F893F8AAF6996A8">
an&s;wer for our Convention, that he will not be laughed at. If it could be made to appear, by any Kind of Arguments, that the Con&s;ecration of Timothy was an Example of pre&s;byterian Ordina|tion, I believe we &s;hould con&s;ider it as a very &s;erious Matter, and allow that it would an&s;wer the Purpo&s;e of our Adver&s;aries.</P>
<P>BUT whether the above&s;aid An&s;wer was proper or not, of which the Reader mu&s;t judge for him&s;elf; the Doctor goes on to challenge <HI>me,</HI> with the Ap|pearance of greater Intrepidity than ever, and more in the Style of a <HI>Champion,</HI> to produce <HI>one &s;ingle In&s;tance of epi&s;copal Ordination, in the appropriated Sen&s;e, from &s;ome or other of the Fathers within</HI> 150 <HI>Years from Chri&s;t,</HI> p. 80: And he allows me to call in the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>any of the epi&s;copal Clergy on the American Continent</HI>; and promi&s;es <HI>to admit as genuine any In&s;tance</HI> that may be brought from Ignatius's Epi&s;tles, although <HI>certainly &s;purious or interpolated.</HI> But he has no Right to expect that I will take Notice of this Defiance, daring and provoking as it is, until he makes &s;ome An&s;wer to a Challenge I gave him <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">In the <HI>Appeal defended,</HI> p. 259.</NOTE>, to &s;upport a certain Charge he brought again&s;t the epi&s;copal Clergy&mdash;or el&s;e to retract it. However, with him I will not in&s;i&s;t upon the Strictne&s;s of <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hed Forms,</HI> and therefore I now give him the following An&s;wer.</P>
<P N="1">1. IF he him&s;elf will point out any In&s;tance in tho&s;e Fathers, wherein a particular Ordination is mentioned, I do, by <HI>the&s;e Pre&s;ents,</HI> engage to prove, without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of any Clergyman on the Continent, that &s;uch Ordination was properly and &s;trictly epi&s;copal.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="99" REF="012007_0106_0F893F8B726A99D8">2. IF no &s;uch In&s;tances are to be found, the Cau&s;e of Epi&s;copacy may be &s;upported without them. The Doctor, I &s;uppo&s;e, will not give up the Cau&s;e of Infant-Bapti&s;m, becau&s;e he can pro|duce no In&s;tances of it, within 150 Years after Chri&s;t. The Fathers, within the Period pre&s;cribed, of who&s;e Writings any Part is now extant, are but few, and there is not one of them who&s;e Works are intire. The Works of Papias, Bi&s;hop of Hi|erapolis, are lo&s;t; the &s;ame Fate has attended the Writings of Hege&s;ippus&mdash;a few Fragments of both, pre&s;erved by Eu&s;ebius, excepted. The literary Productions of Melito, Bi&s;hop of Sardis, which were numerous, and chiefly relating to eccle&s;ia&s;tical Subjects; of Diony&s;ius, Bi&s;hop of Corinth; of Quadratus, Ari&s;tides, and Agrippa &s;urnamed Ca&s;tor, be&s;ides many others that might be menti|oned, have all peri&s;hed. Were they now extant, e&s;pecially the Works of Hege&s;ippus, the particular Intelligence wanted, might rea&s;onably be expected. For Eu&s;ebius and Jerom, who &s;aw the Works of the la&s;t-mentioned Writer, inform us, that he compo&s;ed a compleat Body of eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;tory, in <HI>Five</HI> Books, wherein he related all the principal Occurrences that happened in the Church, after our Saviour's Pa&s;&s;ion to the Time of his Writing.</P>
<P>AS to tho&s;e Works, belonging to the Doctor's. Period, which are extant, they might all be con|tained in a Pocket-Volume.

Now as nothing that remains is of an hi&s;torical Nature, we could hardly expect that they would give us hi&s;torical Accounts. Yet,</P>
<P N="3">3. FROM the&s;e very Writings, and others of the &s;econd Century, we are abundantly able to prove, that there were three Orders of Officers in the Church at this Time, viz. Bi&s;hops, Prie&s;ts and Deacons; and that the Church was under the Go|vernment of Bi&s;hops, as an Order di&s;tinct from, and &s;uperior to, the other Two:&mdash;from whence it follows, that Ordinations were performed by Bi&s;hops.</P>
<P>IT cannot be expected, in a Work of this Na|ture, that I &s;hould collect all the Pa&s;&s;ages in tho&s;e Writings, which relate to the Subject; however, a few of them by Way of Specimen, I beg Leave to pre&s;ent to the Reader. Clemens Romanus, who was a Fellow-Labourer with St. Paul, and one of tho&s;e
<Q>who&s;e Names were written in "the Book of Life <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Philip.</HI> iv.3.</NOTE>,</Q>
in his celebrated <HI>Epi&s;tle to the Co|rinthians,</HI> &s;peaking of the Chri&s;tian Mini&s;try, which he illu&s;trates by the Jewi&s;h Prie&s;thood, &s;ays:

Here are evidently three Orders in the Chri&s;tian Church pointed out, corre&s;ponding with the like Di&s;tinctions in the Jewi&s;h Church; and to the high|e&s;t Order belongs the Superintendency and Go|vernment of the whole.</P>
<P>IGNATIUS, in his Epi&s;tle <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dr. Chauncy very graciou&s;ly allows us, <HI>pro hac Vice,</HI> what we have long claimed and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed as a Right, the U&s;e of Ignatius's Epi&s;tles, which he is plea&s;ed to &s;ay are <HI>certainly &s;purious or interpolated</HI>; but which others &s;ay, who are incom|parably better Judges than he, are undoubtedly <HI>genuine</HI>&mdash; meaning tho&s;e which are publi&s;hed as &s;uch by U&s;her and Vo&s;&s;ius. The following <HI>Hints</HI> are worthy of the Reader's At|tention. The Epi&s;tles of Ignatius were mentioned by Poly|carp, in his Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Philippians,</HI> &s;oon after the Mar|tyrdom of Ignatius; and he informs them, that he had col|lected and &s;ent to them the&s;e very Epi&s;tles.

<P>HEGESIPPUS, in a genuine Fragment of his Works pre&s;erved by Eu&s;ebius, &s;ays:
<Q>when I came to Rome, I compo&s;ed a Succe&s;&s;ion (<HI>i. e.</HI> a Hi&s;tory of the Succe&s;&s;ion) of the Bi&s;hops of that City to the Time of Anicetus (about the Year 153 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Fabricii <HI>Bibliog. antiq.</HI> Cap. vii.</NOTE>) who&s;e Deacon Eleutherus was at that Time.

The regular Succe&s;&s;ion of Bi&s;hops, in the Time of Hegesippus, we &s;ee, was &s;poken of, not as Novelty, but as a Thing commonly known; and in compo&s;ing his eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;tory, he vi|&s;ited the mo&s;t eminent <HI>Sees,</HI> and wrote his Ac|count of their Bi&s;hops upon the Spot, where he had the Advantage, not only of common Infor|mation, but of con&s;ulting the Records of the Church.</P>
<P>THE Three Orders of Bi&s;hops, Prie&s;ts and Dea|cons, are frequently mentioned by other Writers of the &s;econd Century. Clemens of Alexandria, who was in&s;tructed by tho&s;e who had &s;een the Apo&s;tles <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Stromata, Lib. l. p. 201, edit. per <HI>Hein&s;ium.</HI></NOTE>, &s;ays:

<P>IF we go on to Irenaeus, we &s;hall find him boldly declaring:
<Q>We can reckon up tho&s;e whom the Apo&s;tles ordained Bi&s;hops in the &s;everal Churches, and their Succe&s;&s;ors down to own our Times. And if the Apo&s;tles had known any hidden My&s;te|ries &mdash;they would have committed them to the&s;e Men, to whom they committed the Churches them&s;elves. For they were very de&s;irous that tho&s;e &s;hould be perfect and unblameable in all Things, whom they left as their Succe&s;&s;ors, and to whom they committed their own Authority <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Adver&s;us Haere&s;es, Lib. iii, Cap. 3, Edit per Grabe.</NOTE>.</Q>
He then, as an Example, enumerates the Succe&s;&s;ion of Bi&s;hops at Rome in the following Order: Linus, (mentioned by St. Paul in his Epi&s;tle to Timothy) Anacletus, Clemens, Euari&s;tus, Alex|ander, Sixtus, Tele&s;phorus, Hyginus, Pius, Ani|cetus, Soter, and in the 12th Place Eleutherius, who was the Bi&s;hop at that Time. And in another Place, he &s;peaks of a regular Succe&s;&s;ion of Bi&s;hops

<P>THESE Pa&s;&s;ages, to which many other of the like Tendency, from Writers of the &s;econd Cen|tury, might have been ea&s;ily added <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Mo&s;t of the&s;e have been collected by Bi&s;hop Pear&s;on, in his <HI>Vindicia.</HI></NOTE>, prove directly and immediately, as well as unan&s;werably, that throughout the &s;econd Century, Bi&s;hops were di&s;tinct from, and &s;uperior to, Pre&s;byters, and had the chief Government of the Church; and, by <HI>nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equence,</HI> that ORDINATION was their peculiar Office. For there never was in Fact, &s;o far as we can di&s;cover by the Light of Hi&s;tory, nor indeed in the Nature of Things can there be, an epi&s;copal Church, wherein any other than epi&s;|copal Ordination was, or can be, allowed of. In every Society, the Appointment and the Commi&s;|&s;ions of the various Degrees of Officers, mu&s;t proceed from tho&s;e that govern it. This is &s;o evident, that there never was, I believe, an Advo|cate for the Pre&s;byterian Parity, but would readily grant, that when&s;oever and where&s;oever the Govern|ment of the Church was epi&s;copal, the Ordinations were al&s;o epi&s;copal. Therefore the above-recited Pa&s;&s;ages, although they do not inform us of any <HI>&s;ingle</HI> Ordinations that were performed by Bi&s;hops, yet do more; they give &s;ufficient Evidence, that <HI>all</HI> Ordinations were thus performed.</P>
<P>WE come now to the Ca&s;e of the <HI>Walden&s;es.</HI> It was &s;aid in the <HI>Appeal,</HI> that until the Beginning of the Reformation, no In&s;tances worthy of Notice occur,
<PB N="106" REF="012007_0113_0F893F916EB1DF68">
to favour Ordination by Pre&s;byters. The Doctor alledged the Example of the Walden&s;es to the contrary. I replied, that it appeared from Com|menius, that the Walden&s;es pretended always to be epi&s;copal, and that the Bohemians applied to them <HI>as &s;uch,</HI> for Ordination; which they would not have done, had there been Rea&s;on &s;o much as to <HI>&s;u&s;pect,</HI> that they had not the Authority that was wanted. And, be&s;ides the Account given from a very re&s;pectable Writer in An&s;wer to Mr. Owen, I quoted Dr. Mo&s;heim and Dr. Allix, the latter of whom probably under&s;tood the Walden&s;ian Hi&s;tory better than any Writer of his Time, to prove that they were epi&s;copal.</P>
<P>THE Doctor now, in p. 81, endeavours to &s;up|port his former A&s;&s;ertion, by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Two more Authors. The fir&s;t is Paul Perrin, who&s;e Book I have not &s;een; nor does he &s;ay, or intimate, that he has &s;een it him&s;elf. But if he has &s;een it, why may he not mi&s;take that Author even where he &s;peaks plainly, as he does Bi&s;hop Burnet? Let the Reader al&s;o judge how far his Te&s;timony &s;hould be admitted in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, after he has repre&s;ented that, in the Church of England, Pre&s;byters have as much Authority to ordain, as Bi&s;hops. But Allix and Mo&s;heim <HI>had</HI> &s;een Per|rin's Book, and they both believed notwith&s;tanding, that the Walden&s;es were epi&s;copal: From whence I infer, that Paul Perrin proves not the <HI>contrary.</HI></P>
<P>HIS other Author is <HI>that famous Epi&s;copalian,</HI> (he &s;hould have &s;aid, <HI>Leader of the Puritans) Dr. Reignolds,</HI> [Reynolds] <HI>who more than equaled in Learning</HI> (becau&s;e he was a Puritan) <HI>either Mo&s;heim or Dr. Allix</HI>; and he <HI>peremptorily affirms in his
<PB N="107" REF="012007_0114_0F893F922EA34138">
Letter to Sir F. Knolls</HI> (Knollys) <HI>that the Walden&s;es were of the &s;ame Opinion with Aerius</HI> (the Heretic) <HI>as to the Identity of the Order of Bi&s;hops and Pre&s;by|ters.</HI> This is pompous indeed, and calculated to lead the Reader to believe, that this Letter contains &s;uch a clear and particular Account of the Matter, as would convince the mo&s;t &s;tubborn. But the very Letter, unle&s;s I am greatly mi&s;taken, as much as the Doctor has &s;een of it, is in Neal's <HI>Hi&s;tory of the Puritans</HI>; and to gratify the Reader's Curio&s;ity, I will pre&s;ent him with as much of it as has any Relation to the Subject.
<Q>All that have laboured in reforming the Church for 1500 Years, &s;ays the Letter-Writer, have taught, that all Pa&s;tors, be they intitled Bi&s;hops or Prie&s;ts, have equal Authority and Power by God's Word; as fir&s;t the <HI>Walden&s;es,</HI> next Mar&s;ilius Pativinus, &amp;c &dagger;.</Q>
The Reader here &s;ees the whole of the Evidence afforded by Reynolds; and feeble as it is, the Doctor is forced to place upon it a great Part of his Confi|dence. He produces nothing but a Reference to this Extract, and his Account of Paul Perrin's Hi&s;tory, to oppo&s;e to the great Names of Allix and Mo&s;heim.</P>
<P>HERE I might &s;afely re&s;t the Matter; but as it is now in my Way, I will farther confirm what I think already well e&s;tabli&s;hed, by one or two ancient Authorities, out of the many I have at Hand. In an ancient <HI>Abridgement of the Opinions of the Walden&s;es,</HI> recorded by <HI>Wolfius,</HI> at the Year 1160, it is &s;aid:
<Q>They ab&s;olutely deny the Pope's Pri|macy over all Churches, and more e&s;pecially his Power over all Policies, that is, his Power of both Swords; neither do they hold, that any

When the Doctor &s;hall have invalidated the&s;e antient Authorities, by &s;hewing, either that they are <HI>certainly interpolated or &s;purious,</HI> or that they are no Evidence of what they are alledged to prove, others &s;hall be at his Service.</P>
<P>ON the Subject of <HI>Confirmation</HI> he &s;ays but lit|tle. He had objected again&s;t the Practice in the Words of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enting Gentleman,</HI> and I had an&s;wered him in the Words of Mr. White. He now reque&s;ts the Reader, and I heartily join in the Reque&s;t, that he would compare the <HI>Objections</HI> and the <HI>An&s;wer</HI>; and if the latter will not be found adequate to the former, I can only &s;ay that I am greatly mi&s;taken. He concludes with decla|ring, that Mr. Towgood was a Man of much greater Abilities than Mr. White, and Mr. Peirce than Dr. Grey.

The&s;e Subjects all directly tended to the Point in Hand, and were nece&s;&s;ary Parts of &s;uch a Publi|cation as the <HI>Appeal</HI>; and as &s;o little is now &s;aid relating to them by my per&s;evering Antagoni&s;t, what was advanced in tho&s;e Sections may now be con&s;idered as generally e&s;tabli&s;hed. But notwith|&s;tanding their being thus &s;ecure, I &s;hall attend to the few &s;tragling Exceptions &s;till remaining, that have any Appearance of Force or Plau&s;ibility.</P>
<P>IN this Number can hardly be included what is &s;aid in p. 86, in Oppo&s;ition to an Ob&s;ervation made in the <HI>Appeal,</HI> that none but Bi&s;hops have a Right to govern the Church. This Propo&s;ition was affirmed of the Church in its &s;imple, original State, con&s;idered barely as a &s;piritual Society; and the
<PB N="110" REF="012007_0117_0F893F952F054EC8">
Government &s;poken of was evidently &s;uch as is <HI>purely &s;piritual.</HI> The Doctor objected that the Church of England has no Authority of a &s;piri|tual Nature, becau&s;e She acknowledges all Man|ner of Juri&s;diction to flow from the Crown. In|&s;tead of a direct Reply to the Objection in <HI>that</HI> Place, it was thought proper to refer the Reader back, to where the Subject had been formally con&s;idered <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Appeal defended,</HI> p. 49.</NOTE>, and where it was clearly proved that the Supremacy of the Crown was never thought to include &s;piritual Power, in the Sen&s;e of the Objection. And I &s;till think
<Q>it would have been paying but an ill Compliment to the Reader's Under&s;tanding,</Q>
to repeat to him what had been &s;aid but 50 Pages before: And I beg Liberty a|gain to refer to it, as a &s;ufficient Refutation of all the Doctor &s;aid on the Subject in his <HI>An&s;wer,</HI> p. 56, and of all he now &s;ays in his <HI>Reply,</HI> p. 86, and in|deed of all that he can &s;ay.</P>
<P>NOR do I think it worth while to follow him through his Di&s;qui&s;ition about the <HI>Head</HI> of a Thing, and the <HI>Middle</HI> of it: Not that I mean to retract what I &s;aid about his mi&s;taking one for the other, but becau&s;e it can be of no Con&s;equence to our Readers I had advanced, in what, if he plea&s;es, he may call the <HI>Head</HI> of my third Section, this general Propo&s;ition, that without Bi&s;hops the Church of England in America mu&s;t be without Government. This Propo&s;ition, I ob&s;erved, was not meant ab&s;olutely and &s;trictly, but in a quali|fied Sen&s;e. The Doctor objected to this in his <HI>An&s;wer</HI>; to which it was &s;aid in Reply, that it is
<Q>agreeable to &s;trict Method, fir&s;t to lay down a general Propo&s;ition, and then to mark out the
<PB N="111" REF="012007_0118_0F893F95EE9F5938">
Exceptions and Limitations with which it is to be under&s;tood.</Q>
He now rejoins, p. 89, that it is neither con&s;i&s;tent with <HI>Method, or</HI> (nor) <HI>good Sen&s;e to limit a Propo&s;ition that is not capable of Limita|tion.</HI> I know of no <HI>general</HI> Propo&s;ition that is in|capable of Limitation. Indeed <HI>univer&s;al</HI> Propo|&s;itions, in Strictne&s;s, do not admit of Limitation; but yet, as they are &s;ometimes u&s;ed by the mo&s;t cor|rect Writers and Speakers, they mu&s;t be taken in a qualified Sen&s;e. The P&s;almi&s;t &s;ays: They are
<Q><HI>all</HI> gone out of the Way, they are <HI>altogether</HI> become abominable; there is <HI>none</HI> that doeth good, no <HI>not one.</HI></Q>
And yet this Propo&s;ition, predicated of "the Children of Men," although it be an univer&s;al Affirmative, guarded both by po&s;itive and negative Terms, was never true in any other than a limited Sen&s;e. But as to <HI>general</HI> Propo&s;itions, as di&s;tingui&s;hed from <HI>univer&s;al</HI> ones, a Capacity of Limitation is e&s;&s;ential to their Na|ture; for a Propo&s;ition that admits of no Limi|tation, is not <HI>general,</HI> but <HI>univer&s;al.</HI> However, the Limitation of which a <HI>general</HI> Propo&s;ition is always capable, is not always required. For,</P>
<P><Q>AS to Ordination, the general Propo&s;ition, that without Bi&s;hops the Church of England in America mu&s;t be without Ordination, is true without any Exception,</Q>
or Limitation. In An&s;|wer to this the Doctor &s;aid, that notwith&s;tanding our Want of Bi&s;hops, we might have the Ordina|tion we wanted in America, attended with &s;ome <HI>Inconvenience and Charge.</HI> This, con&s;idered as an An&s;wer to the Complaint, I thought amounted to &s;aying, that we might have Ordination in America, by having it in England. Dr. Chauncy &s;ays in Reply, <HI>the Doctor is here illogically in&s;en&s;ible that
<PB N="112" REF="012007_0119_0F893F96AF73CBF0" MS="y">
he is &s;neering at him&s;elf.</HI> p. 90. That I am here &s;neering at my&s;elf, I am truly in&s;en&s;ible; but whe|ther my In&s;en&s;ibility be, according to this admi|rable Di&s;tinction, of the logical or <HI>illogical</HI> Kind, mu&s;t be left to the Deci&s;ion of the <HI>learned</HI> Rea|der. The Complaint was, that Ordination cannot be had at all in America, and that a Voyage to England for that Purpo&s;e is attended with great Inconvenience, Danger and Expence. What could put it into the Doctor's Head to di&s;pute this, and to oppo&s;e it with a Number of Di&s;tinctions, which after all amounted to no more than &s;aying, that we might have Ordinations in America by having them in England, I am unable to conceive.</P>
<P>BUT we are now &s;hewn that there is no Rea&s;on for either Part of the Complaint; and we are di|rected how we may have Ordination in America, without having it in, or from, England. <HI>Not|with&s;tanding this mighty Outcry, there are at lea&s;t two Bi&s;hops now re&s;iding in Briti&s;h America, one in the North, the other in the South Part of it, from either of which it is rea&s;onable to think, the epi&s;co|pal Office might be conveyed, with inconte&s;tible Vali|dity, to an epi&s;copal Pre&s;byter; which would, at once, put an End to all farther Complaint of the Expence and Hazard in going to England to have Ordination in America.</HI> p. 91. We do not di&s;pute the Vali|dity of Orders given by any true Bi&s;hop, whether he be Moravian or Papi&s;t; and I had rather re|ceive Ordination from &s;uch an one, than from all the Pre&s;byters, or Pre&s;byteries, in the Chri&s;tian World. But we have other Objections again&s;t applying either to the Moravians or Papi&s;ts, &s;ome of which, as the Doctor appears to be &s;erious, I will mention.</P>

SUCH an Application, before we know that our Petition for Bi&s;hops will be ab&s;olutely and fi|nally rejected, much more while there is a fair Pro&s;pect of its Succe&s;s, might be con&s;trued as un|dutiful, both by our civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical Gover|nors, whom Providence has placed over us, and to whom we, the Clergy in particular, have &s;worn to behave dutifully and obediently.</P>
<P N="3">3. IT would be &s;chi&s;matical. We &s;hould there|by &s;eparate and withdraw our&s;elves from that &s;ound Part of the Catholic Church, which ju&s;tly claims us as its Members, and is intitled to our Obedience. And we look upon Schi&s;m in the Church of Chri&s;t to be as criminal as it was in the Jewi&s;h Church, although it be not immediately puni&s;hed by the like vi&s;ible Interpo&s;itions of Hea|ven. We look upon Schi&s;m in the Church to have much of the &s;ame Nature with Rebellion in the State; and the Guilt of both is &s;o flagrant in our Opinion, that we con&s;tantly pray in our Lita|nany, to be pre&s;erved from it&mdash;
<Q>from all fal&s;e Doctrince, Here&s;y and <HI>Schi&s;m,</HI></Q>
as well as
<Q>from all Sedition, privy Con&s;piracy and <HI>Rebel|lion.</HI></Q>
Were the Briti&s;h Colonies independent of their Parent-Kingdom, the Epi&s;copalians in this Country would be a Society independent of the national Church; and in that Ca&s;e they might &s;eek for an Epi&s;copate from any Part of the Globe, from which they could expect mo&s;t ea&s;ily to obtain
<PB N="114" REF="012007_0121_0F893F9831A9D630">
it. But &s;uch an Independency they do not affect&mdash; they wi&s;h not to &s;ee; they de&s;ire no more than the common Rights of Briti&s;h <HI>Subjects,</HI> and the com|mon Privileges of their Fellow-Chri&s;tians; or, in other Words, &s;uch a <HI>Toleration</HI> as the Government allows to the Di&s;&s;enters from its own religious E&s;|tabli&s;hment.</P>
<P N="4">4. WE have al&s;o a great Regard for the ancient Canons of the Church, which required that <HI>Three</HI> Bi&s;hops &s;hould impo&s;e Hands at the Ordination of a Bi&s;hop. Although this may not be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, yet it has been always <HI>canonical</HI>; and we have &s;uch a Veneration for the Church in its pri|mitive Ages, that we would rather &s;ubmit to the Trouble of going to any Part of Europe for an Epi&s;copate, than depart from the Example She has &s;et us:&mdash;e&s;pecially in the Con&s;ecration of our <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Bi&s;hops, from whence, in that Ca&s;e, all our future ones would probably proceed. Now the Bi&s;hops in the Briti&s;h Colonies are but <HI>Two</HI>; and they are &s;o remote from each other, and their Prin|ciples, as well as Intere&s;ts, are in many Re&s;pects &s;o oppo&s;ite, that it would be extreme difficult to per&s;uade them to come together, and to join in &s;uch a Con&s;ecration.</P>
<P N="5">5. THE Bi&s;hop of Canada and the Moravian Bi&s;hop in Penn&s;ylvania, are both Briti&s;h Subjects, and both tolerated by a peculiar Indulgence; and they would probably conceive it to be very unbe|coming in them, without the Con&s;ent of Govern|ment, to convey the epi&s;copal Character to the Church of England in the Colonies, the Tendency of which would be to render it independent of the national Church. And before the Government
<PB N="115" REF="012007_0122_0F893F98F00C1C20">
would con&s;ent to this, it would undoubtedly con|&s;ent to our having an Epi&s;copate in &s;uch a Manner as is reque&s;ted.</P>
<P>THUS our not having applied to the Moravians or Papi&s;ts for a Bi&s;hop hitherto, has been a Mat|ter both of Prudence and Con&s;cience; and the following Reflections are very unju&s;t, and very un|charitable. <HI>It may rea&s;onably, and will be &s;trongly &s;u&s;pected,</HI> &s;ays the Doctor, <HI>Something more than that which is purely &s;piritual is hankered after, if the poor Church of England in the Colonies, is &s;uf|fered to continue in a lamentably peri&s;hing Condition for Want of a Bi&s;hop, when She may have one, with|out any Hazard of Life, and at a &s;mall Expence of Pocket, by only repairing to an American Bi&s;hop. Surely the Cry of Di&s;tre&s;s and Mi&s;ery, for Want of a purely &s;piritual Bi&s;hop, will be di&s;regarded, as it ought to be, until it be made evident, that due Ap|plication has been made to one or other of the conti|nental Bi&s;hops, and that they have refu&s;ed to con&s;e|crate a Bi&s;hop for the Colonies, or to ordain Candi|dates for holy Orders. If the epi&s;copal Clergy had been as zealous in their Application to the Bi&s;hops in America, as they have been el&s;ewhere, they might without all Doubt, have had one from among them|&s;elves ve&s;ted with the epi&s;copal Powers of Ordination and Government long before now.</HI> p. 92.</P>
<P>THE Doctor now takes a Leap over more than 20 Pages of my <HI>Defence,</HI> and lights down upon that Part of it, where <HI>the Society</HI>'s offering to de|fray the Expences of going to England for Ordi|nation was con&s;idered. He complains bitterly, p. 93, of what he calls the <HI>&s;currilous</HI> Treatment he received <HI>in one of the New-York periodical Papers,</HI>
<PB N="116" REF="012007_0123_0F893F9A96A593B0">
on Account of his An&s;wer to what I had &s;aid of the Expen&s;ivene&s;s of &s;uch a Voyage to our Candidates. As I was not the Writer of that Paper, I will leave it to the Author to defend it, if he thinks proper, or to give the Doctor Satisfaction. But he complains bitterly of me too, for having <HI>remarked upon it in a Manner much below the Gentleman, not to &s;ay the Chri&s;tian Divine.</HI> How the Matter was, will appear pre&s;ently. He hopes <HI>the Reader will bear with him,</HI> while he explains the Affair; and I hope the Reader will al&s;o bear with me, while I con&s;ider that Explanation.</P>
<P>WHAT relates to this Subject in the Doctor's former Pamphlet, is in p. 81, in the following Words. <HI>Another Rea&s;on</HI> (of Complaint) <HI>is,</HI>
<Q>the Expence of the Voyage, which cannot be reck|oned at le&s;s, upon an Average, than One Hun|dred Pounds Sterling to each Per&s;on.</Q>
<HI>And this is aggravated by the Con&s;ideration, that</HI>
<Q>the Ex|pence mu&s;t generally fall upon &s;uch, as, having already expended the greate&s;t Part of their Pit|tance, in their Education, will find it extremely hard to rai&s;e a &s;ufficient Sum for the Purpo&s;e.</Q>
<HI>I candidly &s;uppo&s;e the Dr. had never &s;een, or, if he had, did not remember at the Time of writing, the Account of the Society, publi&s;hed in</HI> 1706, <HI>in which they &s;ay</HI> p. 74,
<Q>all young Students in tho&s;e Parts (<HI>meaning the Colonies</HI>) who de&s;ire epi&s;copal Ordi|nation, are invited into England; and their EXPENCES in coming and returning are to be defrayed by the Society.</Q>
<HI>According to this In|vitation, there is no Hard&s;hip as to the Article of</HI> "Expence," <HI>that can be complained of, unle&s;s ab|&s;urdly, but by the Society them&s;elves; and they cannot have ju&s;t Rea&s;on for Complaint, as the Money they
<PB N="117" REF="012007_0124_0F893F9B2F1515D8">
expend in this Way is as properly be&s;towed, as in Sup|port of the Mi&s;&s;ionaries them&s;elves.</HI></P>
<P>BEFORE the Reader proceeds farther, I beg of him to review this Pa&s;&s;age, and to mark its appa|rent De&s;ign and Tendency. Is it not manife&s;tly worded in &s;uch a Manner, as to excite the Idea, that the Voyage to England is not expen&s;ive to the Candidates? I know of &s;everal, that upon reading the Pa&s;&s;age, under&s;tood that the Doctor ab&s;olutely affirmed this; and I know of but one Per&s;on, who at fir&s;t perceived that he did not affirm it. It had been a&s;&s;erted, that
<Q>the Expence upon an Ave|rage was no le&s;s than &pound;. 100 Sterling to each Per&s;on;</Q>
does not the An&s;wer lead one to be|lieve that it is not a Farthing? Nay does it not
<Q>ap|pear to be <HI>artfully</HI> calculated to lead the Reader al&s;o to believe &s;omething farther; namely, that concerning a plain Matter of Fact, with Regard to which it is impo&s;&s;ible that any Mi&s;&s;ionary can be mi&s;taken, I publi&s;hed to the World an ab|&s;olute wilful Fal&s;ehood?</Q>
&mdash;and that I was &s;o
<Q>a|bominably &s;tupid,</Q>
as to publi&s;h
<Q>a Fal&s;ehood which was known to be &s;uch, not only by every Mi&s;&s;ionary on the Continent, but by every Mem|ber of the Society both here and at home, and by every Bi&s;hop in the Kingdom <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Appeal defended,</HI> p. 124.</NOTE>?</Q>
This is what I a&s;&s;erted; and the A&s;&s;ertion is true, that <HI>to me</HI> it had that Appearance. It was not affirmed that the Doctor <HI>intended,</HI> but only that I <HI>feared</HI> it was his Intention, to lead his Readers thus to con|ceive of me. The Su&s;picion, if there had been no Foundation for it, would, I confe&s;s, have been injurious to his Character, as &s;uch Conduct is in|con&s;i&s;tent with common Hone&s;ty; but as the
<PB N="118" REF="012007_0125_0F893F9BEF0E5360">
Words, in my Opinion, naturally &s;ugge&s;ted it, and I had no other Way of judging of his De&s;ign, than from the natural Tendency and the known Effect of the Pa&s;&s;age, he has no Rea&s;on to com|plain; as I formed my Judgment according to the Evidence which he him&s;elf afforded.</P>
<P>MY Repre&s;entation of the Expen&s;ivene&s;s of the Voyage to Candidates I knew to be true; he could not know it to be fal&s;e, or unfair; why then did he di&s;pute it? And by di&s;puting it, why would he <HI>appear</HI> to contradict me? By alledging again&s;t me the Society's Invitation to Candidates in 1706, he <HI>appeared</HI> to &s;ay, while he &s;eemed careful to avoid expre&s;sly &s;aying, what was yet &s;trongly in&s;inuated by the whole Structure of the Paragraph, that the Expence fell upon the Society, and not upon the Candidates. He knew that if what was thus art|fully in&s;inuated was received as true, what I a&s;&s;erted mu&s;t have been received as fal&s;e; and that I mu&s;t have been thought a Liar, in a Ca&s;e wherein I could not po&s;&s;ibly have been mi&s;taken, and con&s;equently a <HI>wilful</HI> Liar. In this View of the Ca&s;e, his &s;up|po&s;ing that I had not &s;een, or had forgotten, the Society's Invitation, was no more than &s;uppo&s;ing, that I did not recollect that &s;uch Evidence was in the Hands of the Public, as was a Proof of the Fal&s;ene&s;s of my A&s;&s;ertion. A very <HI>candid</HI> and charitable Suppo&s;ition truly!</P>
<P>HE conceits that I was incon&s;i&s;tent with my&s;elf, in pretending to &s;u&s;pect him in this Manner, while I allowed that he <HI>candidly</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed I had not &s;een the Society's Invitation. But to &s;peak plainly, and without a Figure, I did not imagine that there was <HI>Candor</HI> in any Part of the Affair. The Word
<PB N="119" REF="012007_0126_0F893F9CB0B2ACC0">
<HI>candidly</HI> was his own; I u&s;ed it as &s;uch with the Mark of Quotation, and returned it to him in an <HI>ironical</HI> Sen&s;e. In Order to heighten the Irony, I introduced it with <HI>very,</HI> a Word of my own, &s;ay|ing that he VERY <HI>candidly</HI> made the Suppo&s;ition; which <HI>ironical</HI> U&s;e of the Word I would not have made, I a&s;&s;ure him, had I imagined it could have po&s;&s;ibly been mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>IN explaining him&s;elf upon the Subject he now declares, in the&s;e Words: <HI>in direct Contradiction to this</HI> ACKNOWLEDGED CANDOR, <HI>he</HI> (Dr. Chandler) <HI>would lead the Reader to think, that it was my In|tention to repre&s;ent him as an abominably &s;tupid Liar. It was in Truth my real De&s;ign, explicitly as well as candidly &s;ignified, to guard him again&s;t enter|taining any &s;uch Thought.</HI> p. 97. Some People have a &s;trange Way of puting their <HI>De&s;igns</HI> in Execution. What the Doctor &s;ays was his De&s;ign, I <HI>candidly</HI> believe to be true, in the Sen&s;e wherein he means it. But whether I, or a common Rea|der, can come at that determinate Sen&s;e, there is Room to doubt. A Man may be a <HI>Liar,</HI> and yet not a <HI>&s;tupid</HI> one; he may be <HI>&s;tupid,</HI> and yet not <HI>abominably</HI> &s;tupid: And whether he means, that he endeavoured to guard again&s;t the Reader's con|ceiving of me as a <HI>Liar,</HI> or as a <HI>&s;tupid Liar,</HI> or only as an <HI>abominably &s;tupid</HI> one, he has not &s;aid with &s;ufficient Preci&s;ion. And why &s;hould he have endeavored to <HI>guard</HI> again&s;t this, if he was not con&s;cious of having &s;aid what would otherwi&s;e tend to lead into the Mi&s;take?</P>
<P>THAT I made not a fair Repre&s;entation of the Matter, he &s;till in&s;inuates, without po&s;itively af|firming. <HI>For,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>though I neither &s;aid, nor
<PB N="120" REF="012007_0127_0F893F9D71355DC8">
intended to &s;ay it before, I &s;ay it now in plain Words, that he did not declare the Truth</HI>&mdash;IF&mdash;(if what? Why <HI>if) he intended to make his Readers believe, agreeably to the evident Import of his Words,</HI>
<Q>that the Expence of the Voyage to England for Or|ders, was, to each Per&s;on,</Q>
<HI>out of his own Poc|ket without Exception,</HI>
<Q>One Hundred Pounds Sterling.</Q>
I never meant to &s;ay this; nor do my Words import, that <HI>without Exception,</HI> every Can|didate expended in his Voyage to England &pound;. 100 Sterling, <HI>out of his own Pocket.</HI> I knew very well, that every Candidate's Pocket does not contain &pound;. 100 Sterling, and that what it does not contain cannot be expended out of it. But this I &s;aid, that the Expence of the Voyage, on an Average, is &pound;. 100 Sterling to each Candidate; it being to &s;ome more, and perhaps to &s;ome a little le&s;s. This Expence has never been defrayed by the Society; the Candidates have generally born it them&s;elves: But in tho&s;e In&s;tances wherein they have been un|able, Donations for that Purpo&s;e have been made by their Friends, or Money has been advanced by the Congregations in which they were to officiate; and in this Ca&s;e it is mo&s;t commonly deducted af|terwards, if they live to return, either wholly or partly from the &s;tipulated Salary, &s;o that thus far it finally falls upon the Candidates them&s;elves.</P>
<P>BUT it &s;eems that, in New-England, <HI>it is com|mon for Candidates to be much a&s;&s;i&s;ted in their Voy|age.</HI> This <HI>much A&s;&s;i&s;tance,</HI> except in the Ca&s;e be|fore mentioned, &s;eldom amounts to more than the Sea-Stores for the Pa&s;&s;age to England, if I have been rightly informed. But &s;uppo&s;ing it to be otherwi&s;e, &pound;. 100 Sterling is the Expence attend|ing the Voyage of each Candidate; and whether
<PB N="121" REF="012007_0128_0F893F9E30A3F338">
it falls upon him&s;elf, or his Friends, or his future Congregation, it does not weaken the Complaint. What an intolerable Burthen would the Congrega|tionali&s;ts in New-England e&s;teem it, if every Or|dination of theirs was loaded with the Expence of &pound;. 100 Sterling, to be paid, either by the Candi|date, or his Friends, or the Congregation? Were this the Ca&s;e, if I know my own Heart, I &s;hould be a&s;hamed of <HI>appearing</HI> to oppo&s;e, but would heartily join in promoting any proper Plan for their Relief.</P>
<P>AS to the Defence of the Doctor's Conduct, in the In&s;tance under Con&s;ideration, attempted by the Author of
<Q>a <HI>fictitious</HI> Letter from a Mem|ber of the Society,</Q>
(the Letter is called <HI>fictiti|ous,</HI> becau&s;e the only Member of the Society, with the initial Letters of who&s;e Name it was &s;igned, di&s;avowed it with abhorrence) I am not &s;en&s;ible that I &s;aid any Thing relating to it, that was in|con&s;i&s;tent with the Character of a <HI>Gentleman</HI> or <HI>Chri&s;tian Divine.</HI> What I &s;aid was, that without 'an abler and fairer Advocate' than the Author of that Letter,
<Q>the Doctor's Reputation mu&s;t &s;uffer,</Q>
by the Charge of Fal&s;ehood, which a Writer in one of our periodical Papers had brought again&s;t him, on Account of the Pa&s;&s;age that is &s;till before us. The Fal&s;ehood charged upon him was, his publi&s;hing
<Q>that all the Candidates for holy Orders in the Church of England, have the Expences of the Voyage home paid by the Society <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A WHIP for the <HI>American Whig,</HI> Numb. XIV.</NOTE>.</Q>
The Doctor did not directly &s;ay this; but the above-mentioned Writer thought, as mo&s;t People did, that he attempted to <HI>prove</HI> it, and that attempting publickly to prove a Fal&s;ehood,
<PB N="122" REF="012007_0129_0F893F84AFE231A8">
was equal to <HI>publi&s;hing</HI> a Fal&s;ehood, and might ju&s;tly be called &s;o. It had been alledged by the Doctor as a Medium of Proof that the Voyage to England was not expen&s;ive, as was repre&s;ented in the <HI>Appeal,</HI> that the Society publi&s;hed &s;uch an In|vitation to Candidates in 1706, as he mentioned. The Fact was not denied; but &s;uch an Applica|tion of it was the Object of the Cen&s;ure. The Vindication therefore that took no Notice of this wrong Application, fell &s;hort of the Accu&s;ation; on which Account it was imperfect and feeble, and in&s;ufficient to &s;ecure the Reputation that was at Stake.</P>
<P>THE Doctor affects to think that the Society's Invitation in 1706 is &s;till binding to them, unle&s;s it has been formally recalled. But as it was not expre&s;&s;ed in Words that extended it forward, it expired of Cour&s;e. It appears upon the Face of the Invitation, that it was only an occa&s;ional Act. All is expre&s;&s;ed in the pre&s;ent Time, without a &s;ingle Word to intimate an Intention of its being a &s;tanding and perpetual Rule. I believe that e|very Vote or Law of a Body Corporate, that is de&s;igned for Continuance, has &s;ome Words that clearly expre&s;s that De&s;ign; and where no &s;uch Words are u&s;ed, that it is always under&s;tood to be only occa&s;ional, or to &s;erve for the pre&s;ent Time. But, &s;ays the Doctor, the Society Five or Six Years afterwards ordered the &s;ame <HI>Account,</HI> &amp;c. contain|ing this Invitation, to be reprinted with a Conti|nuation; &s;o that the Invitation, by their Order, was <HI>printed and reprinted:</HI> From whence he would have his Readers to infer, at lea&s;t, that the Invi|tation was in Force Five or Six Years after it was fir&s;t made. But the Book might have been order|ed
<PB N="123" REF="012007_0130_0F893F9EEEFAB3F0">
to be reprinted, without any particular View to this Pa&s;&s;age; and the Pa&s;&s;age might have been de&s;ignedly pre&s;ented again to the Public, to &s;hew a Step that had been formerly taken, in Order to &s;upply the Church in America with the Mi&s;&s;iona|ries wanted. It appears that none accepted of the Invitation when it was fir&s;t made, and that it ne|ver was repeated, any farther than every new Edi|tion of the Hi&s;tory that records it, made by the Society's Order, may be called a Repetition of it.</P>
<P>WHEN the fir&s;t Candidates went home from hence, which was not until many Years afterwards, they received no Benefit from the Invitation in Que&s;tion. The Society knew that, both in its Nature and De&s;ign, it was then antiquated; other|wi&s;e, if they cho&s;e not to fulfil it's Promi&s;e, they would have taken Care to recall it. About Eight Years after the Time now &s;poken of, Dr. Berke|ley, who had re&s;ided a con&s;iderable while in this Country, in his Sermon before the Society, &s;peak|ing of &s;uch Mi&s;&s;ionaries as had been born and edu|cated in America, &s;ays:
<Q>I verily think it might increa&s;e the Number of &s;uch u&s;eful Men, if Provi&s;ion were made to defray their Charges in coming hither, to receive holy Orders; pa&s;&s;ing and repa&s;&s;ing the Ocean, and tarrying the nece&s;|&s;ary Time in <HI>London,</HI> requiring an Expence that many are not able to bear.</Q>
This implies that he knew nothing of any Provi&s;ion then in being, by Virtue of any Order, or Vote, or Invitation of the Society, for defraying the Expences attending the Voyage of Candidates: And as the Sermon was ordered to be printed, without a Correction of this Pa&s;&s;age, or any explanatory Note, we may be certain that the Society, as a Body, knew no|thing
<PB N="124" REF="012007_0131_0F893F9FAE567CE0">
of it neither. But I will not enlarge farther in &s;o plain a Ca&s;e. I will only return to Dr. Chauncy &s;ome of his own Language, relating to this Head, it being not &s;o much my Property, as his. <HI>The Doctor, perhaps, may in Time make high|er Attainments in Learning of this Kind, than he is at pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of.&mdash;For it is no infrequent Thing with him to affirm that, both publickly and boldly which he never would have done, had it not been for want of more Knowledge.</HI> p. 102.</P>
<P>IT has always been thought very hard, that the Church of England in the Colonies &s;hould be di&s;|tingui&s;hed, and, as it were, &s;tigmatized by a Want of tho&s;e religious Privileges, which are granted to all other Denominations of Chri&s;tians. The Doc|tor, whom I will <HI>warrant</HI>&mdash;as the mo&s;t compleat and univer&s;al Opponent that ever dealt in Contro|ver&s;y, denies this Fact too. He affirms, <HI>that it is the exact Truth,</HI> that the Epi&s;copalians
<Q>have the &s;ame <HI>Liberty</HI></Q>
<HI>with all other Per&s;ua&s;ions.</HI> The &s;ame Liberty to do and enjoy <HI>&s;ome</HI> Things, they undoubtedly have: But have they the Liberty of enjoying their own peculiar Form of eccle&s;ia&s;tical Government, in the &s;ame Manner that other De|nominations have? Can their Candidates be or|dained without great Lo&s;s of Time, Hazard and Expence, as tho&s;e of the Pre&s;byterians and Con|gregationali&s;ts may? <HI>If they cannot,</HI> &s;ays the Doc|tor, <HI>it is not owing to any Want of Liberty, but to their not u&s;ing that Liberty which is equally granted to all Denominations without Di&s;tinction.</HI> p. 103. What we have not a Liberty to enjoy con&s;i&s;tently with our Principles, we have no Liberty to enjoy at all. But, &s;ays this <HI>profe&s;&s;ed Defender</HI> of LIBER|TY, it is then <HI>from your Principles only that you
<PB N="125" REF="012007_0132_0F893FA154D93050">
are hampered with Difficulties.</HI> This, as I told him before, is the Language of Tyranny and Per&s;e|cution, but notwith&s;tanding he repeats it. But what can he mean, by being <HI>hampered by Princi|ples?</HI> If we are allowed to enjoy and practice what our Principles require, we are not <HI>hampered</HI> by them: But, if we are not allowed this, we have not an equal Liberty with tho&s;e, who are permit|ted to enjoy and practice all that their Principles do require. If no public Wor&s;hip were permit|ted in the Colonies, but according to the Liturgy of the Church of England, the Di&s;&s;enters might be told, according to the Doctor's Mode of rea|&s;oning, that they had the &s;ame Liberty with the Members of the Church; meaning that they had Liberty to do, contrary to their Inclination, what the Members of the Church <HI>cho&s;e</HI> to do. But would &s;uch Liberty as this content them? Would telling them that it was <HI>only from their Principles that they were hampered with Difficulties,</HI> &s;ilence their Complaints? I trow not. The great Com|plaint is that we are hampered by Difficulties, from, or on Account of, our religious Principles. We wi&s;h to have &s;uch Embarra&s;&s;ments removed, and to be upon the &s;ame Footing with tho&s;e that are not thus embarra&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>THE Doctor, who is &s;o lucky as never to want for Di&s;tinctions, &s;ays, that we are <HI>under no more Re&s;traint, than the other Denominations, by any in|terpo&s;ing</HI> ACT OF THE STATE. p. 104. But what is this to the Purpo&s;e of proving, that we have the &s;ame religious Liberty with Chri&s;tians of other Denominations? If we are not under Re&s;traint from any Act of the Legi&s;lature, yet if we are under peculiar Di&s;advantages on &s;ome other Ac|counts,
<PB N="126" REF="012007_0133_0F893FA1EF345DA8">
which render us incapable of enjoying what our Fellow-Chri&s;tians of all other Denomi|tions enjoy, why &s;hould not a Remedy be provi|ded for tho&s;e peculiar Di&s;advantages? Nay, &s;hould it appear that our Principles and Connections are &s;uch, that a proper Remedy could not be provi|ded, without an <HI>interpo&s;ing Act of the State</HI> in our Favour, we humbly conceive that this would be an Object not unworthy of the Attention of the Legi&s;lature, and that we &s;hould have a Right to petition for &s;uch an <HI>Act:</HI> And as barely religious Liberty, and not any Authority over others, is the End in View, no true Friends to religious Liber|ty and Toleration ought to oppo&s;e us. Religious Li|berty con&s;i&s;ts in a Freedom to perform all the Of|fices and public Duties which Men's Religion re|quires, without Mole&s;tation or Re&s;traint. And the Enjoyment of this Liberty may be interrupted or prevented by other Ways, as well as by the In|terpo&s;ition of Government. The Effect may be the &s;ame, whatever Cau&s;e, or Concurrence of Cau&s;es, may have produced it. The Epi&s;copali|ans in the Colonies know and perpetually feel, that they have not the &s;ame Liberty, which they &s;ee others around them po&s;&s;e&s;s and exerci&s;e. They do not enjoy &s;ome of the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary In&s;tituti|ons of their Religion, and of this they complain. But they never have complained, that they had no Dominion over any of the religious Sects in the Colonies:&mdash;They have never complained of not being di&s;tingui&s;hed by any &s;uperior Advantages:&mdash; They only reque&s;t, and they only wi&s;h, to be rai|&s;ed to an Equality. They think them&s;elves inti|tled to &s;o much, by the common Rights of Chri&s;|tians, which they are not con&s;cious that they have forfeited.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="012007_0134_0F893FA2B2301D30">THE Doctor goes on to &s;peak of me, in the following high and figurative Language. <HI>He can perceive no Difference between Difficulties, &s;uffered upon Principle, in Con&s;equence of the Non-be&s;towment of di&s;tingui&s;hing Favour, and Difficulties that are &s;uffered for not complying with the arbitrary, tyran|nical Precepts of Men, in Violation of the Rights of Con&s;cience: Yea, he would make us believe, that Difficulties &s;uffered, upon Principle, through Want of a Grant of Favour, may, with as much Perti|nency, be complained of as any of the Tortures the Saints of the mo&s;t High have been harra&s;&s;ed with, for their Adherence to their God, from the greate&s;t Per|&s;ecutors that ever exi&s;ted.</HI> p. 104.

<Q>Men were not to be pitied, when their Sufferings re&s;ult from their Principles.

Or that Men, of who&s;e Principles HE does not approve, ought to be per&s;ecuted <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Appeal defended,</HI> p. 136.</NOTE>?</Q>
Such was the Provocation given him! Upon &s;o &s;light Ba&s;is is this ma&s;&s;y Column of Mi&s;repre&s;entation e|rected!

De&s;ign of it is to put an End to Di&s;tinctions, <HI>and Difficulties that are &s;uffered from arbitrary and ty|rannical Precepts.</HI> But Difficulties are &s;till Diffi|culties: and when Men, who are under no Difficul|ties that can interfere with the full Enjoyment of all their religious Privileges, endeavour to ob&s;truct the Removal of Difficulties in the Way of others, becau&s;e they do not approve of their Principles; they &s;o far are actuated by the Spirit of Inqui&s;itors, and &s;o far di&s;cover that very Di&s;po&s;ition, which has in|flicted the &s;evere&s;t <HI>Tortures, the Saints of the mo&s;t High have been</HI> ever <HI>harra&s;&s;ed with.</HI> It concerns &s;ome People to examine their own Hearts, whether they have not, in Reality, too much of this abo|minable and accur&s;ed Spirit.</P>
<P>THE Doctor now takes another Leap that is prodigious indeed, from p. 136 to p. 196 of my <HI>Defence,</HI> containing the whole fourth, fifth, &s;ixth, and the far greater Part of the &s;eventh Sections. As he profe&s;&s;es him&s;elf in his Title-Page to be a <HI>Rectifier</HI> of my <HI>Mi&s;takes,</HI> and a <HI>Refuter</HI> of my <HI>fal&s;e arguing,</HI> it will naturally be concluded, that he could find no Mi&s;takes, in tho&s;e 60 Pages, that he was able to rectify, nor any fal&s;e arguing that he was able to refute; or, at lea&s;t, none that was of material Con&s;equence. He therefore pa&s;&s;es on to the Ca&s;e of a <HI>Negative</HI> put upon the Reque&s;t of the <HI>Non-Epi&s;copalians</HI> in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> for a Royal Charter, to enable them to conduct and manage a Fund of &pound;. 2000 Sterling rai&s;ed by Sub&s;cription, for the Support of <HI>Mi&s;&s;ionaries among the Indian Natives.</HI> The Defeat of this Application he in&s;i|nuated to have been occa&s;ioned by <HI>epi&s;copal Influ|ence.</HI> What he meant by this Expre&s;&s;ion, I col|lected from a Pa&s;&s;age in his REMARKS on the Bi|&s;hop
<PB N="129" REF="012007_0136_0F893FA433004640">
of <HI>Landaff</HI>'s Sermon, wherein he &s;ays: <HI>It is hoped the Accounts we have had are not true, that the Negative upon this Act</HI> (of the Bo&s;ton A&s;&s;em|bly) <HI>was principally owing to the Influence of &s;ome of the mo&s;t important Members of the Society for the Propagation of the Go&s;pel.</HI> I replied in the Words of an able Writer, in his VINDICATION of the Bi|&s;hop of <HI>Landaff</HI>'s Sermon, wherein the utter Im|probability of &s;uch a Su&s;picion was pointed out, and an Extract of a Letter from one of the <HI>mo&s;t important</HI> Members of the Society was given, de|claring, that the Scheme &s;ent home was rejected on Account of its internal Defects, and that
<Q><HI>the Society,</HI> MADE NO OPPOSITION TO IT.</Q>
I al&s;o produced a Declaration from Mr. Apthorp, ano|ther Member of the Society, who affirmed, after due Inquiry and upon proper Authority that the Rejection was
<Q>meerly on political and commer|cial Rea&s;ons, which aro&s;e from <HI>the Manner of drawing it up,</HI> and were repre&s;ented by the Board of Trade to the Privy-Council, who <HI>unanimou&s;ly</HI> di&s;approved it, when there was <HI>not one Bi&s;hop pre&s;ent</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Apthorp<HI>'s Review</HI> of Dr. Mayhew's Remarks, p. 39.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>THE only Evidence of the Interpo&s;ition of <HI>epi&s;|copal Influence</HI> to defeat the above-mentioned Pe|tition, was the Te&s;timony of an unknown Letter-Writer; and even he affirms only that <HI>there is Rea&s;on to think,</HI> that the Ca&s;e was as he repre&s;ented it to be. Such a Te&s;timony, in Proof of a Fact that was important in its Con&s;equences, no rea|&s;onable Per&s;on could think worthy of Notice, e&s;|pecially after direct Evidence was produced to the contrary; wherefore I treated it with the Con|tempt
<PB N="130" REF="012007_0137_0F893FA4EE6F44A0">
it de&s;erved. The Doctor now does not en|deavour to e&s;tabli&s;h the Reputation of his unknown Witne&s;s, nor to introduce any new ones; but he attempts to weaken the Influence of mine. The Archbi&s;hop, he conceits, prevaricated; Mr. Ap|thorp was a Quibler; and neither of them an&s;wer|ed directly to the Point. However, he &s;eems to allow, that <HI>the Society in their Character as &s;uch</HI> "made no Oppo&s;ition" to the <HI>incorporating Act</HI> under Con&s;ideration. Nay, he confe&s;&s;es, <HI>it may, in like Manner, be true, that,</HI> although <HI>Epi&s;copalians might u&s;e their Influence again&s;t the pa&s;&s;ing this Act,</HI> yet <HI>they might not do it as</HI> SUCH. But if Epi&s;co|palians, in their Oppo&s;ition, acted not <HI>as &s;uch,</HI> or in Con&s;equence of their epi&s;copal Principles, the Oppo&s;ition they made, cannot, with any Propriety, be called an Exertion of <HI>epi&s;copal Influence</HI>; that not being epi&s;copal, which has no Relation to, or Connection with, the Doctrine or Cau&s;e of Epi&s;|copacy.</P>
<P>BUT notwith&s;tanding the Want of Evidence to &s;upport it, and notwith&s;tanding his own Conce&s;&s;i|ons again&s;t it, the Doctor appears to be re&s;olved not to give up his Su&s;picion, that the Plan of the <HI>Bo&s;tonians</HI> received an <HI>epi&s;copal</HI> Overthrow. The Society, he is &s;ure, could wi&s;h it no good; but were jealous of the Succe&s;s that would probably attend it, if &s;uffered to proceed. <HI>I am heartily &s;orry,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>I am obliged to &s;ay that this</HI>
<Q>Num|ber of eminently pious Men,</Q>
<HI>have given the Pub|lic &s;o little Rea&s;on to think, that they have the Con|ver&s;ion of Savages much at Heart. Had this been the real Truth, it is impo&s;&s;ible but they &s;hould have done much more than they have ever yet done to promote their Conver&s;ion. They have made it abundantly e|vident,
<PB N="131" REF="012007_0138_0F893FA6970EF828">
that they had at Heart the</HI> PROPAGATION OF EPISCOPACY <HI>much more than the Conver&s;ion of Savages; and if we may be permitted to judge from their Conduct, we &s;hall naturally, and almo&s;t nece&s;|&s;arily, be obliged to think, they would be in Readine&s;s to oppo&s;e any Plan for the Conver&s;ion of Savages, that did not propo&s;e to convert them by epi&s;copi&s;ing them.</HI> p. 105.</P>
<P>LET us con&s;ider the Particulars of this <HI>candid</HI> and <HI>charitable</HI> Repre&s;entation. The Society appear not to the Doctor to have the Conver&s;ion of Savages at Heart, becau&s;e they have done no more in Or|der to effect it. He judges of their Inclination from their Attempts, and of their Attempts from their Succe&s;s; and he allows not their Succe&s;s to have been &s;o con&s;iderable as it really has been. And yet they have always declared their earne&s;t De&s;ire of chri&s;tiani&s;ing the American Heathens; and their Declarations have been made under &s;uch Circum&s;tances, from Time to Time, as gave no Room ju&s;tly to &s;u&s;pect their Sincerity. Their At|tempts al&s;o to convert them were early, and fre|quently repeated; and they have con&s;tantly, from their fir&s;t Incorporation to this Day, &s;ought for Opportunities, and have never neglected one that has offered with any Pro&s;pect of Succe&s;s, to pro|pagate the Go&s;pel among the native Heathens of America.</P>
<P>THEY were no &s;ooner formed, than they inqui|red for, obtained, and &s;ent a Mi&s;&s;ionary to South-Carolina, to &s;ee what religious Impre&s;&s;ions might be made upon the Indians in that Quarter. This was in 1702, the very next Year after their Incor|poration. In 1704, having tried without Succe&s;s
<PB N="132" REF="012007_0139_0F893FA72F140080">
to per&s;uade both an Engli&s;h and a Dutch Clergyman in this Country, that were conveniently &s;ituated for the Purpo&s;e, to engage in &s;uch a Service, they provided and &s;ent over a Mi&s;&s;ionary from England, of an excellent Character, to the <HI>Mohawks</HI>; with Information that another Mini&s;ter might be ex|pected for the <HI>Oneidas,</HI> and one for every Tribe in Alliance with them,
<Q>as &s;oon as proper and wil|ling Per&s;ons could be found.</Q>
This Mi&s;&s;iona|ry, meeting with a very unfavourable Reception, thought proper, after a Year's fruitle&s;s Trial, to give over the Attempt. Notwith&s;tanding, another was &s;ent over and introduced to them in 1709, but to little Purpo&s;e; yet, in the Year following, the <HI>Reque&s;t</HI> of the Four Sachems, then in En|gland, being thought favourable to the Society's Intentions, it was agreed forthwith to &s;end over Two Mi&s;&s;ionaries, with an Allowance of a Salary of &pound;. 150 Sterling to each, be&s;ides an Interpreter and School-Ma&s;ter to attend him. One actually was &s;ent; another probably could not be found to accompany him: But after a Cour&s;e of unavail|ing Efforts to an&s;wer the great Ends of his Mi&s;&s;i|on, and finding him&s;elf to be in Danger of his Life, this Mi&s;&s;ionary al&s;o was obliged to leave them. I might continue the like Account to the pre&s;ent Time; but as the Society's Conduct re|lating to the Indians has been clearly and ju&s;tly repre&s;ented, by a Writer of eminent Abilities and Candor, in his <HI>An&s;wer to Dr. Mahew's Ob&s;ervati|ons,</HI> nothing farther need be &s;aid in Vindication of it.</P>
<P>AND here it de&s;erves &s;pecial Notice, that pro|pagating the Go&s;pel among the American Savages was not the primary and principal De&s;ign of the
<PB N="133" REF="012007_0140_0F893FA7EF073AF8">
Society, if we may judge, either from the Words of their Charter, or the Views of tho&s;e worthy Per&s;ons who petitioned for it, or the Opinion of its leading Members from that Time to this. The Society was erected in Order
<Q>to promote the Glory of God, by the In&s;truction of OUR PEO|PLE in the Chri&s;tian Religion.</Q>
It was to pro|vide for the King's LOVING SUBJECTS in the Ame|rican Plantations, who are repeatedly &s;poken of in the Preamble to the Charter, as the great and im|mediate Object of the intended Charity; and the Indians are not &s;o much as once mentioned on the Occa&s;ion. The religious State of the King's Sub|jects in mo&s;t of the Colonies, at that Time, was lamentably bad. Many of them had no Oppor|tunies at all for public Wor&s;hip, and were as de&s;ti|tute of the Chri&s;tian Sacraments as the Heathens them&s;elves. Accounts were &s;ent home, by Per&s;ons of the be&s;t Character among&s;t them, that for Want of public In&s;truction People were daily falling a|way, even from the very Profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity into Heatheni&s;m, or a State of Nature. Now the De&s;ign of the Society was to &s;top the Progre&s;s of this Apo&s;tacy; and to recover the lap&s;ed, by &s;end|ing <HI>orthodox</HI> Clergymen to re&s;ide and officiate a|mong them. And let Envy it&s;elf &s;ay, whether there could be a more worthy and charitable De|&s;ign than this!</P>
<P>THE Prevention of a Chri&s;tian's Apo&s;tacy to Heatheni&s;m, is of as much Con&s;equence in it&s;elf, at any Time, as the Conver&s;ion of a Heathen to Chri&s;tianity. The Recovery of an Apo&s;tate is as great an Acqui&s;ition, as the gaining of an origi|nal Heathen. The Conver&s;ion of a civilized Hea|then or Infidel, and &s;uch were many of the King's
<PB N="134" REF="012007_0141_0F893FA8B1712290">
Subjects, was as good a Work as the Conver&s;ion of a Savage one. It was therefore highly nece&s;&s;a|ry that the Society's Charity &s;hould begin at home, among our own People&mdash;with a View, at the &s;ame Time, of extending it farther, as their Cir|cum&s;tances and Opportunities &s;hould permit.</P>
<P>SUPPOSING the Society had been at Liberty to expend as much of their Fund in propagating the Go&s;pel among the Indians, as in &s;upporting and propagating it among our own People, which was by no Means the Ca&s;e; yet it would have been right and judicious Conduct, in the Exerci&s;e of &s;uch a di&s;cretionary Power, to expend the far greater Part of their Money in providing for the King's Subjects. For many of the latter were not only willing to accept of Mi&s;&s;ionaries, but &s;incere|ly de&s;ired them, and earne&s;tly reque&s;ted to have them: Whereas the very Rever&s;e of this good Temper appeared in the Indians. There was there|fore Rea&s;on to expect, that the &s;ame Sum expend|ed in the Colonies would be far more u&s;eful, and produce a much better Effect, than if expended among the neighbouring Tribes of Indians. In|deed, as St. Paul ob&s;erves, Men cannot hear with|out a Preacher; but if they have Preachers, and will not hear them, it is impo&s;&s;ible that they &s;hould <HI>believe</HI> in Con&s;equence of their preaching, or be pro&s;elyted to that Faith which comes by hearing. This &s;eems to have been the general Temper and Di&s;po&s;ition of the Indians, with Regard to Chri&s;|tianity.</P>
<P>DR. Wheelock, who has thought much upon the Subject of propagating the Go&s;pel among the Indians, &s;ays:
<Q>There is no &s;uch Thing as &s;ending
<PB N="135" REF="012007_0142_0F893FA9708D5DF8">
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mi&s;&s;ionaries, or &s;ettling or maintaining Engli&s;h Schools to any good Purpo&s;e, in mo&s;t Places among them, as their Temper, State and Condition <HI>have</HI> been<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">See <HI>a plain and faithful</HI> NARRATIVE, &amp;c. p. 19.</NOTE>.</Q>
Again:
<Q>As to mo&s;t Places, there is no &s;uch Thing at pre&s;ent as introducing either <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> School-Ma&s;ters or Mi&s;&s;ionaries to continue with them; &s;uch are their Prejudices in general, and &s;uch the male|volent and ungovernable Temper of &s;ome, that none but an <HI>Indian</HI> would dare to venture his Life among them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 21.</NOTE>.</Q>
Such is the Character and Di&s;po&s;ition of the Indians in general, and &s;uch it has been ever &s;ince the Incorporation of the Society, according to Dr. Wheelock.</P>
<P>THAT the Society have made it <HI>abundantly evi|dent, that they had at Heart the Propagation of Epi&s;copacy, much more than the Conver&s;ion of Savages,</HI> is a vile Reflection on that venerable Body. Dr. Mayhew, taught by another, and in&s;tigated by his own <HI>anti-epi&s;copal</HI> Zeal, was guilty of this Abu&s;e &s;ome Years ago, for which he received public Correction. Dr. Chauncy has the Hardine&s;s to repeat it, notwith&s;tanding a Vindication of the Society, that has been deemed fully &s;atisfactory by the candid and impartial; for which I beg Leave to refer to the before-mentioned <HI>An&s;wer</HI> to Dr. Mayhew's <HI>Ob&s;ervations.</HI></P>
<P>IF the Society had the Propagation of Epi&s;copacy at Heart, in the Sen&s;e wherein it is objected, they would undoubtedly have in&s;tructed their Mi&s;&s;iona|ries to make this a con&s;iderable Part of their Bu&s;ine&s;s. It can never be &s;uppo&s;ed that they would
<PB N="136" REF="012007_0143_0F893FAA34959BE0">
&s;end Per&s;ons abroad, at a great Expence, with a View to any particular Service, without informing them that &s;uch Service was expected from them. But nothing of this Kind has ever been given in Charge in their <HI>public</HI> In&s;tructions: On the other Hand, their Mi&s;&s;ionaries are directed to
<Q>keep always in View the great De&s;ign of their Under|taking, viz. To promote the Glory of God, and the Salvation of Men, by propagating the Go&s;pel of our Lord and Saviour;</Q>
and it is required of them,
<Q>that the chief Subject of their Sermons be the great fundamental Principles of Chri&s;tianity, and the Duties of a &s;ober, righteous and godly Life, as re&s;ulting from tho&s;e Principles <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See <HI>a Collection of Papers,</HI> &amp;c. p. 20 and 23.</NOTE>.</Q>
And as to <HI>private</HI> Directions, although from the very Nature of them I cannot be &s;o po&s;itive about the&s;e, as their public ones; yet I mo&s;t firmly believe, from every Thing that I can recollect or learn upon Inquiry, that no Mi&s;&s;ionary was ever in&s;tructed, either verbally before he came abroad, or by any Letter or Letters afterwards, to endeavour to pro|pagate Epi&s;copacy, or any of the di&s;tingui&s;hing Principles of the Church of England. And if any Mi&s;&s;ionaries have made the Attempt, or have behaved in &s;uch a Manner as to give ju&s;t Umbrage to any of their Neighbours, it has been their own free and voluntary Act, and what the Society have never required at their Hands.</P>
<P>THE Mi&s;&s;ionaries wi&s;h, that all the King's Sub|jects, throughout the Briti&s;h Dominions, would become Epi&s;copalians and Members of the Church of England: But, as they are not employed to mole&s;t any Prote&s;tants in the Enjoyment of their own Principles, &s;o I believe they &s;eldom do&mdash;far|ther
<PB N="137" REF="012007_0144_0F893FAAEEC59648">
than their own nece&s;&s;ary Defence may require&punc; Within the Compa&s;s of my Knowledge, I am verily per&s;uaded, that for every In&s;tance of an Attack made upon the Di&s;&s;enters by any Mi&s;&s;ionary or Member of the Church, <HI>Twenty</HI> at lea&s;t are made by Di&s;&s;enters upon Churchmen. I know more of their Conduct of this Kind than perhaps they ima|gine; and I have often been &s;urpri&s;ed to di&s;cover, to what low and pitiful Arts &s;ome, who think them&s;elves Men of Con&s;equence, can de&s;cend, in Order to prevail with the mo&s;t in&s;ignificant Per&s;on, and &s;ometimes even with a &s;tupid Negro, to leave the Church and go to their Meeting.</P>
<P>THE A&s;&s;ertion, that we are <HI>naturally and almo&s;t</HI> nece&s;&s;arily obliged to think, from the Society's <HI>Conduct,</HI> that they would OPPOSE <HI>any Plan for the Conver&s;ion of the Savages, that did not propo&s;e to convert them by epi&s;copi&s;ing them,</HI> I &s;hould not have expected from a Gentleman of the Doctor's Cha|racter, as it is worthy of a <HI>Savage</HI> only. Unle&s;s the Society look upon Pre&s;byteriani&s;m, for In&s;tance, to be no better than Indian Heatheni&s;m, they would choo&s;e rather that the Indians &s;hould become Pre&s;byterians, than remain in their pre&s;ent State. They undoubtedly wi&s;h, in the fir&s;t Place, that every Indian may be converted, and that every &s;uch Conver&s;ion may be compleat; <HI>i. e.</HI> that every pro|&s;elyted Indian may become not only almo&s;t,
<Q>but altogether &s;uch,</Q>
both in Faith and Practice, as the Rules and Precepts contained in Scripture are thought to require. If they cannot be per&s;uaded to become <HI>altogether</HI> &s;uch, they wi&s;h, in the next Place, that they may become <HI>almo&s;t,</HI> and as nearly &s;uch as po&s;&s;ible. The Society wi&s;h to be in&s;tru|mental in converting all the Indian Tribes: But, as
<PB N="138" REF="012007_0145_0F893FAC9472F470">
they know that they are unable to carry this into Execution, they envy none the Honour of being Sharers in this good Work, that are able and wil|ling to promote it in any Degree. If they had rather the Indians &s;hould become Members of that Church which they prefer, than &s;top &s;hort of it, they are not cen&s;urable for this; for, at the &s;ame Time, they had rather they &s;hould become Pro|te&s;tants, of any Denomination, than Papi&s;ts&mdash;and they had rather they &s;hould become Papi&s;ts, than continue to be Heathens. I could produce, from their Hi&s;tory and annual Ab&s;tracts, many Proofs of this Di&s;po&s;ition; and I defy their bittere&s;t Ene|mies, even Dr. Chauncy him&s;elf, to bring any Proof of the contrary.</P>
<P>THE Indian Mi&s;&s;ion at Stockbridge, under the Direction of the <HI>Commi&s;&s;ioners</HI> (of the Society in Scotland) re&s;iding in Bo&s;ton, is indebted to Mem|bers of our Society for con&s;iderable Donations. It is more indebted to the Members of the Church of England; who have given more to promote that &s;ingle Mi&s;&s;ion, than I believe the Di&s;&s;enters have ever given to <HI>the Society for the Propagation of the Go&s;pel,</HI> from its fir&s;t Exi&s;tence to this Day. If Mi&s;&s;ionaries from New-England &s;hould receive Checks from Government in any Part of their Pro|ceedings, this cannot, with any Ju&s;tice or Propri|ety, be charged to the Account of the Society. If Government &s;hould hereafter di&s;cover, or have Rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, that any of tho&s;e Mi&s;&s;ionaries endeavour, together with the Propagation of their Religion, to e&s;tabli&s;h a <HI>political</HI> Intere&s;t of their own Party, different from the general Intere&s;t of the Nation; or, that they incumber the <HI>Sale of Lands</HI> to the Briti&s;h Crown, by &s;tipulating with the Indians

for certain Conditions in Favour of their own Schemes; they will have no Right to expect the Countenance of Government in &s;uch Proceedings.

<P>IT was thought &s;trange that he &s;hould in&s;inuate that the before-mentioned <HI>incorporating Act</HI> was defeated by <HI>epi&s;copal Influence,</HI> without taking No|tice of Mr. Apthorp's Declaration to the contrary, which he could not have been

as not to have &s;een. The Matter is now clearly accounted for, in p. 108. <HI>It is at once &s;olved,</HI> replies the Doctor, <HI>by only &s;aying, it was none of my Bu&s;ine&s;s to take Notice of this Evidence, until</HI> it had been <HI>produced.</HI> The Reader here &s;ees in what Manner he has rendered him&s;elf &s;o very exceptionable, both in his Rea&s;onings and Repre|&s;entations.

our Plan. After this hone&s;t and artle&s;s Confe&s;&s;ion, his Readers will know how to make proper Al|lowances, for what he advances in a controver&s;ial Way.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>eighth</HI> Section of the <HI>Appeal,</HI> a full and fair Account was given, of the only Plan on which it was reque&s;ted than an American Epi&s;copate might be granted, with Expo&s;tulations on the Rea|&s;onablene&s;s of &s;uch an Appointment. In <HI>An&s;wer</HI> to this Section the Doctor &s;eemed really to exert him&s;elf; and he called in, to aid his own Efforts, what he &s;ays was POWERFULLY <HI>offered by the late excel|lent Dr. Mayhew.</HI> In my Reply, particular Notice was taken of every Thing produced, either from his own Store or the late Dr. Mayhew's Magazine, that <HI>appeared</HI> to have Force; and enough was &s;aid to &s;hew, if I am not greatly mi&s;taken, that every Objection exhibited was either groundle&s;s or imper|tinent. The Doctor in his <HI>Rejoinder,</HI> which he mi&s;calls his <HI>Reply,</HI> &s;eems to &s;ay a great deal in Sup|port of his former Objections. It is here, if any where, that he aims his Blows directly at the Vitals of the Epi&s;copate reque&s;ted, and does his utmo&s;t; for which Rea&s;on I &s;hall take a particular Review of what, in this Place, he has done and &s;aid.</P>
<P>BEFORE he proceeds to an immediate Attack, he has &s;ome Ob&s;ervations of a mi&s;cellaneous Na|ture, &s;everal of which I &s;hall pa&s;s by as utterly im|pertinent. He begins with endeavoring to rai&s;e, in the Minds of Readers, but an indifferent Idea of what I had &s;aid upon the <HI>main Point.</HI> He tells them that he was greatly di&s;appointed, that I fell &s;hort of his Expectation, and that what I &s;aid on the Subject was <HI>le&s;s convincing</HI> than what I had <HI>of|fered
<PB N="141" REF="012007_0148_0F893FAEB05F7410">
in any Part of my Performance.</HI> p. 109. This, I think, di&s;covers his Heroi&s;m, rather than his Policy; for according to the apparent Weakne&s;s of his Antagoni&s;t, the Honor of a Victory will be proportionably abated.</P>
<P>HERE he again takes Notice of our Conventi|on's Addre&s;s to the Univer&s;ity of Cambridge, on the Subject of American Bi&s;hops; and he &s;eems to to think, that, becau&s;e &s;ome of his Friends have publi&s;hed a <HI>&s;purious</HI> Copy of that Addre&s;s, therefore he is intitled to a <HI>true</HI> one. He is determined not to be &s;atisfied until he &s;ees a Copy that is genuine, and will continue to &s;u&s;pect that the obnoxious Expre&s;&s;ions contained in the fal&s;e Copy were al&s;o in the true one, notwith&s;tanding our Declarations to the contrary. This is treating us rather unge|nerou&s;ly, as the Te&s;timony of a Number of Per|&s;ons that have &s;een and are acquainted with any particular Writing, is always allowed to have more Weight, than the Te&s;timony of a &s;ingle Per&s;on, perhaps an unknown one, that has never &s;een it&mdash; where the Di&s;pute is about the Contents of that Writing. If therefore he determines not to &s;ubmit to the Evidence of our Te&s;timony, I advi&s;e him, for the pre&s;ent, to &s;u&s;pend his Judgment of the Matter, until he &s;hall obtain a Sight of the Ad|dre&s;s, and to wait with Patience; as Time may po&s;&s;ibly bring forward, what it is not in his Power to ha&s;ten.</P>
<P>AMONG a Number of paradoxical Things ad|vanced in his <HI>An&s;wer</HI> to the <HI>Appeal,</HI> it was &s;aid: <HI>Some of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable Epi&s;copalians, in the&s;e Parts, for Sobriety, good Sen&s;e,</HI> and <HI>a &s;teady Attach|ment to the Intere&s;t of the Church of England, have
<PB N="142" REF="012007_0149_0F893FAF6F37F788">
declared it to be their Opinion, that Bi&s;hops would be of no Service here, and they did not de&s;ire they &s;hould be &s;ent.</HI> What was meant by the indefinite Word <HI>&s;ome,</HI> whether Two or Two Hundred, I was unable to determine. The Doctor &s;ays I might have known the Meaning of it, <HI>i. e.</HI> its <HI>preci&s;e</HI> Meaning, if I had attended to the following Sentence. Let us &s;ee then how the Matter is cleared up in the explanatory &s;entence. <HI>And it is to me, as well as to</HI> MANY <HI>I have conver&s;ed with on this Head,</HI> EPIS|COPALIANS <HI>among others, very que&s;tionable,</HI> &amp;c. Here the Word <HI>many</HI> is impo&s;ed upon the Reader, as an Explanation of the Word <HI>&s;ome</HI> in the fore|going Sentence: Whereas <HI>many Epi&s;copalians</HI> are not here mentioned, but only <HI>many</HI> People, <HI>&s;ome</HI> of whom were <HI>Epi&s;copalians</HI>; &s;o that the Word <HI>&s;ome</HI> is &s;till left as indeterminate as ever. I then que&s;tioned whether there was an Epi&s;copalian on the Continent, ju&s;tly &s;o called, that was aver&s;e to American Bi&s;hops on the Plan of the <HI>Appeal.</HI> I knew of none, had heard of none, could conceive of none. Such a Character is &s;o ab&s;urd, that I did not imagine it had an actual Exi&s;tence. An Epi&s;copalian is one that, at lea&s;t, approves of the Government of the Church by Bi&s;hops; but he that only approves of the Government of the Church by Bi&s;hops re&s;iding at the Di&s;tance of 3000 Miles, can hardly be &s;aid to approve of it at all, or to be an Epi&s;copalian in any Sen&s;e. An Epi&s;|copalian is one that al&s;o approves of Ordination by Bi&s;hops; but he that only approves of epi&s;copal Ordination under the Circum&s;tances of a long, dangerous and expen&s;ive Voyage to obtain it, may be thought by the Doctor to be <HI>re&s;pectable for his good Sen&s;e,</HI> and may be e&s;teemed by him for SUCH an <HI>Attachment to the Intere&s;t of the Church of
<PB N="143" REF="012007_0150_0F893FB02E6BA2F0">
England in the Colonies</HI>; but <HI>as an Epi&s;copalian</HI> he will appear to all its real Friends to be truly ridi|culous. It was therefore natural to interpret the Word <HI>&s;ome</HI> in as &s;canty a Sen&s;e as it would any Way bear; and it was paying great Regard to his Te&s;timony, in &s;o incredible a Ca&s;e, to believe his A&s;&s;ertion in that Sen&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>BUT what is all this to the Point:</HI> &s;ays he. <HI>It is a Fact, not a &s;peculative Truth, we are now upon,</HI> p. 112. This is calling the Credibility of a Fact a <HI>&s;peculative</HI> Matter; but it is &s;peculative in no other Sen&s;e than that, wherein the Per&s;ons he mentions are <HI>Epi&s;copalians</HI>&mdash;a Sen&s;e, which will never be admitted by tho&s;e, who content them&s;elves with Words in their common Acceptation.</P>
<P>BUT, <HI>where is the Difficulty of &s;uppo&s;ing, that mo&s;t Epi&s;copalians on the Continent may have a quite dif|ferent Notion of the Plan for an American Epi&s;co|pate, from that the epi&s;copal Clergy have of it, who were its</HI> ONLY FORMERS, <HI>and the</HI> ONLY PETITIONERS <HI>that it might be carried into Execution?</HI> If by the epi&s;copal Clergy he means tho&s;e of America, it is not true that they were the <HI>only Formers</HI> of the Plan in Que&s;tion. They do not pretend to have <HI>formed</HI> it at all; but they have adopted it when formed by others, not exclu&s;ively of the Laity. Nor were they the only <HI>Petitioners</HI> in Favour of it; for &s;eve|ral of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Lay-Gentlemen in the Colonies have recommended and petitioned for it, although not jointly with the Clergy of our Con|vention. Many others were al&s;o con&s;ulted, who &s;ignified their Approbation of it, before our Peti|tions were framed. All of them could not be con&s;ulted in a private Way, and therefore it was
<PB N="144" REF="012007_0151_0F893FB1D5A2C5C8">
thought proper to publi&s;h it to the World, before it could be put in Execution; that all might have an Opportunity to con&s;ider it, and to offer their Objections if they had any.</P>
<P>THERE were many Members of the Church that were, upon the whole, aver&s;e to an Epi&s;copate in this Country; imagining it would either expo&s;e them to con&s;iderable Expence for its Support, or put them to &s;ome other Inconveniencies. But when they came to &s;ee, that every Thing of this Kind had been carefully guarded again&s;t, and that from its De&s;ign and Tendency it would be mild and beneficial in its Operation, which appeared as &s;oon as it was explained to them; their Aver&s;ion immediately cea&s;ed, and from that Time they have generally viewed it in the &s;ame Light with that wherein it is &s;een by the Clergy.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH what has been &s;aid of the Epi&s;copa|lians <HI>in the&s;e Parts</HI> is univer&s;ally true, without an Exception, to the be&s;t of my Knowledge, the Doctor however has this to comfort him, that the Epi&s;copalians in and about Bo&s;ton, are of a different Opinion. For, &s;ays he, <HI>that the Mi&s;&s;ion of Bi&s;hops into the Colonies would do more Hurt than good, I</HI> KNOW, <HI>is, in Fact, the Opinion of</HI> MANY <HI>Lay-Epi&s;|copalians, and, I believe, of the greater Part of them in the New-England Colonies.</HI> What is here &s;aid of the Epi&s;copalians in New-England, mu&s;t not be under&s;tood to extend to Connecticut, which contains more in Number than the three other Co|lonies, and where they are unanimous in wi&s;hing for an Epi&s;copate. As to the Epi&s;copalians in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, New-Hamp&s;hire and Rhode-I&s;land, they are not yet univer&s;ally acquainted with the
<PB N="145" REF="012007_0152_0F893FB26ED9E968">
Plan. It is therefore not improbable that the Doctor may <HI>know,</HI> either per&s;onally or by Infor|mation, of <HI>many, i. e.</HI> of <HI>Eight</HI> or <HI>Ten,</HI> for the Word does not nece&s;&s;arily mean more, that &s;till think unfavourably of an American Epi&s;copate. But it is remarkable that he does not yet &s;ay, that <HI>any</HI> are aver&s;e to an Epi&s;copate <HI>on the Plan of the Appeal,</HI> who are acquainted with it otherwi&s;e than by Mi&s;information. I fancy it would be difficult to find <HI>many</HI> &s;uch, or even <HI>&s;ome.</HI> I have inquired of Per&s;ons that are not Strangers in Bo&s;ton, and I have never heard of but <HI>one</HI> &s;uch <HI>Epi&s;copalian</HI>; and he is generally looked upon by Churchmen, and frequently by others, to be a Di&s;grace to his Pro|fe&s;&s;ion. While he calls him&s;elf a Churchman, he a&s;&s;ociates and connects him&s;elf with the bittere&s;t Enemies of the Church, is governed by their In|fluence, and &s;uffers him&s;elf to be u&s;ed as an In&s;tru|ment in their Hands to injure its Reputation and de&s;troy his own.</P>
<P>AND here it may de&s;erve Notice, that there are many People in New-England, be&s;ides Epi&s;copa|lians, that have no Aver&s;ion to an American Epi&s;copate. This may be ju&s;tly &s;aid of the Quakers in general, unle&s;s they differ widely from their Brethren in Penn&s;ylvania and New-Jer&s;ey, where they are more numerous and more re&s;pectable than in any other Parts of his Maje&s;ty's Dominions, compared with the other Inhabitants. And a Wri|ter in Favour of the Bapti&s;ts in New-England, who is &s;uppo&s;ed to expre&s;s the general Sentiments of that Denomination of Chri&s;tians, &s;ays, with a Tartne&s;s that &s;eems to have been excited by an Opinion of their Oppre&s;&s;ion: "The Fraternity," (meaning the Pre&s;byterian or congregational Mi|ni&s;ters)
<PB N="146" REF="012007_0153_0F893FB3305DDDD0">
<Q>la&s;t Year have &s;ent Letters to Bapti&s;t Mini&s;ters in New-England, reque&s;ting their Aid again&s;t the Church of England. But truly it is the Intere&s;t of the Bapti&s;ts that the Church of England &s;hould multiply in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts and Connecticut, &s;o far as to form a Ballance of eccle&s;ia&s;tical Power there, as in other Colonies. And as for <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> they are welcome there; their coming thither is an Object <HI>worthy of</HI> PE|TITIONS; we cannot be wor&s;e off; we may be better: <HI>they</HI> are Gentlemen at lea&s;t, and have &s;ome Genero&s;ity for vanqui&s;hed Enemies. But the New-England People (of a certain Deno|mination) are &s;upercilious in Power, and mean in Conque&s;t. I will venture to &s;ay, that all the Bi&s;hops in Old England have not done the Bap|ti&s;ts there &s;o much De&s;pite for 80 Years pa&s;t, as the Pre&s;byterians have done <HI>this Year</HI> to the Bapti&s;ts of New-England <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Goddard<HI>'s Penn&s;ylvania Chronicle,</HI> Nov. 26th, 1770.</NOTE>.</Q>
And that the latter are not incon&s;iderable in Number appears from what this Writer tells us, who a&s;&s;erts that
<Q>there are 37 Congregations of them in Ma&s;&s;a|&s;etts</Q>
only; to &s;ay nothing of Rhode-I&s;land, where they are more numerous and much more powerful than in any of the other Colonies.</P>
<P>THE Doctor objected again&s;t our Plan, that it had been <HI>illegally</HI> &s;ettled. This Objection, if ju&s;t, more nearly concerns the Friends of the Plan, than its Enemies: And while he objects the <HI>Ille|gality</HI> of the Plan, he &s;ays much to per&s;uade us to put it <HI>far more illegally</HI> into Execution. But why was it illegally &s;ettled? Becau&s;e, &s;ays he, it was projected and formed, <HI>to the intire Neglect of his Maje&s;ty, without who&s;e</HI> LICENCE, <HI>not even the Con|vocation

have any Right to &s;ettle &s;uch a Plan, or &s;o much as</HI> ATTEMPT <HI>to form it.</HI> p. 113. In Reply to this he was told, that under whatever Re&s;traints a Convocation might be laid, the Plan was not the Work of a Convocation. But he argues, that if the Convocation, without a &s;pecial Licence, cannot attempt &s;uch a Thing, much le&s;s can it be attempted by Clergymen out of Convocation&mdash; Clergymen of le&s;s Di&s;tinction perhaps, and fewer in Number. But this Argument is by no Means conclu&s;ive. The Parliament of Great Britain, for In&s;tance, when met together upon public Bu&s;ine&s;s, are tied up to the Strictne&s;s of Rules and Forms; but when the Members meet together occa&s;ionally or de&s;ignedly, in their private Character, they are free from tho&s;e Re&s;traints to which they were &s;ub|ject in their parliamentary Capacity. The like may be &s;aid of the Convocation; the Members of which, at a private Meeting, may lawfully do many Things, and in &s;uch a Way, as are not per|mited to be done at all, or in that Way, in Con|vocation.</P>
<P>NOR has his Maje&s;ty been <HI>intirely neglected</HI> in this Affair. Indeed the Prince upon the Throne was never neglected, when the Scheme for an Ameri|can Epi&s;copate was made the Object of Attention. The Ca&s;e of the Epi&s;copalians in the Colonies was duly con&s;idered by the Society, and the Plan for an Epi&s;copate, peculiarly fitted to their Circum|&s;tances, was brought nearly to its pre&s;ent Form, in the Reign of Queen <HI>Anne</HI>&mdash;when an Order was i&s;&s;ued by the Crown, for a Bill to be drawn and pre&s;ented to the Parliament for the Confirmation of it <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">See the <HI>Appeal.</HI> p. 52.</NOTE>. An American Epi&s;copate was propo&s;ed
<PB N="148" REF="012007_0155_0F893FB4B02EAFB0">
long before this Time: The Subject then was brought before the King's Privy Council, &s;o that we have no Rea&s;on to think his Maje&s;ty was neg|lected, at that Time. The &s;ame venerable Per|&s;on, who furni&s;hed the Extract from Cranmer<HI>'s Catechi&s;m,</HI> in another Letter of Feb. 28th, 1770, to a different Per&s;on, &s;ays:&mdash;
<Q>that <HI>he</HI> had met with an original Letter, that fell into his Hands by Executor&s;hip, from Dr. <HI>Alexander Murray,</HI> in which he found that the Council had come to a Re&s;olution to e&s;tabli&s;h Epi&s;copacy in Virginia; that he him&s;elf (Dr. Murray) who had attended <HI>Charles</HI> II. abroad, &s;hould be the fir&s;t Bi&s;hop; that the Plan of E&s;tabli&s;hment was referred to the Bi&s;hop of London and Sir Orlando Bridg|man, and this was, &s;o far as <HI>he</HI> could recollect, Oct. 16, 1673. And <HI>he</HI> &s;uppo&s;es the Matter then died, by the <HI>Cabal</HI>'s throwing out Sir Or|lando in the November following, before the Bi&s;hop and he made their Report <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The late Archbi&s;hop di&s;covered, from &s;ome Papers of Bi&s;hop Gib&s;on, that there was &s;uch a De&s;ign in the Time of <HI>Charles,</HI> II. and

He adds, that he had returned the Original to the Duke of Bedford, with &s;everal other Papers belonging to the Duke's Family, but had taken a Copy of it. To &s;ay nothing farther of the intermediate Reigns, the Plan was properly laid before his pre&s;ent Ma|je&s;ty, and he heartily approved of it; and of this Royal Approbation &s;ome Members of our Con|vention had received authentic Evidence, before their Petitions were voted. As therefore our Friends have no ju&s;t Rea&s;on to blame us for proceeding <HI>illegally, to the intire Neglect of his Maje&s;ty,</HI> our
<PB N="149" REF="012007_0156_0F893FB56EEEFBF0">
Enemies have certainly no Right to reproach us with it.</P>
<P><HI>WHY then was not the Plan introduced with par|ticular Notice of &s;o important a Point of Deference to the Royal Supremacy?</HI> p. 118. Becau&s;e it was not needful. The De&s;ign was to inform the igno|rant of the true Plan that was propo&s;ed for an A|merican Epi&s;copate, and to convince the preju|diced of the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of it; and it would not have promoted either Part of the De&s;ign, to have told the Reader what the King thought of it. But afterwards, in replying to the Doctor's Objec|tions, this Information became proper, and he doubtle&s;s received from it no &s;mall Con&s;olation. However, he is not altogether &s;atisfied, for he in|quires farther: <HI>Why is there not now exhibited in Form &s;ome authentic Proof of the King's</HI> LICENCE <HI>to contrive and publi&s;h the Plan we</HI> HAVE HAD HELD <HI>out to View?</HI> p. 116. The King could give no Licence to <HI>contrive</HI> a Plan that was contrived long before he exi&s;ted; but authentic Proof of his Ap|probation of it, and that he does not look upon the Steps that have been taken as any Infringe|ment of the Royal Supremacy, we are able to give. We pretend not to have proceeded in all the Forms of a Convocation, which would have been a ridi|culous Affectation, nor to have received a <HI>Licence</HI> under the great Seal. Such a Licence was not nece&s;&s;ary; it was &s;ufficient for our Convention, that his Maje&s;ty had con&s;idered and was favorable to the Epi&s;copate in View, and that our Evidence of his favorable Di&s;po&s;ition was &s;uch as could not be que&s;tioned. Our Evidence of this important Fact we have not laid before the Public, becau&s;e this would be taking a Liberty that has not been
<PB N="150" REF="012007_0157_0F893FB67108E310">
granted; and we are re&s;olved to do nothing but what is <HI>&s;trictly</HI> warrantable.</P>
<P>IF nothing el&s;e could be &s;aid to ju&s;tify the Con|duct of tho&s;e who propo&s;ed the Plan, yet
<Q>the Charter granted to the Society for the Propagati|on of the Go&s;pel, has the Nature and Efficacy of a Royal Commi&s;&s;ion,</Q>
and warranted them to concert any Plans that might be thought nece&s;&s;ary, in Order more fully to an&s;wer the Ends of their Incorporation. They <HI>&s;oon</HI> were convinced that an American Epi&s;copate would be highly u&s;eful to this Purpo&s;e. They mention the Matter as early as the <HI>Ab&s;tract</HI> annexed to the anniver&s;ary Sermon preached in 1703, by Bi&s;hop Burnet. From their entering &s;o &s;oon upon the Subject, it may fairly be concluded, that, in <HI>their</HI> Opinion, the Charter gave them the Authority in Que&s;tion.</P>
<P>INDEED the Doctor allows, that the Society had a Right to form <HI>a general Plan for &s;ending Bi&s;hops to America,</HI> and that this may be <HI>perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with due Honor to the Royal Supremacy</HI>; but not to plan &s;uch an Epi&s;copate as that of the <HI>Appeal.</HI> For, it &s;eems, the Bi&s;hops therein propo&s;ed, are <HI>to carry on the Bu&s;ine&s;s of eccle&s;ia&s;tical Government and Di&s;cipline in a Manner quite different from that which is injoined by the Authority of the King and Parliament.</HI> p. 117. The King and Parliament have pre&s;cribed in what Manner eccle&s;ia&s;tical Go|vernment &s;hall be admini&s;tred in England; but the Statute is not quoted, wherein they have in|joined any Form of it for the Colonies. Indeed he alledges the 73d <HI>Canon,</HI> which is pointed again&s;t tho&s;e that <HI>impeach</HI> or <HI>deprave</HI>

but nothing which has not this Tendency is for|bidden by the Canon. The Canon could have no Reference to the Colonies, becau&s;e they were not &s;ettled at the Time of framing it; and therefore it is not violated, by propo&s;ing an Epi&s;copate for the Colonies, that is peculiarly adapted to the Cir|cum&s;tances of the Inhabitants.</P>
<P>BUT, &s;ays the Doctor: <HI>Why do Colony-Epi&s;copa|lians glory in being Members of the Church of En|gland, if there is no Church of England here? And if there is, it is as rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e the Canon was intended to guard its e&s;tabli&s;hed Form of Go|vernment again&s;t Impeachment and Depravation here, as at home.</HI> p. 118. We glory in being Mem|bers of the Church of England, becau&s;e we e|&s;teem it to be the pure&s;t and be&s;t Church upon Earth. We are Members of that Church, not|with&s;tanding our di&s;tant Situation, becau&s;e we not only receive her Articles and embrace her Liturgy, but more e&s;pecially becau&s;e we &s;ubmit to her Au|thority, and all our eccle&s;ia&s;tical Offices are per|formed by Power derived from her Bi&s;hops. The Church of England therefore extends it&s;elf into the Colonies, and <HI>partly</HI> exi&s;ts here; although at pre&s;ent in &s;uch an imperfect State, for Want of an Epi&s;copate, as to be a proper Object of the cha|ritable Interpo&s;ition of all its Friends.</P>
<P>BUT if the Church of England exi&s;ts here, it is argued, that the Canon mu&s;t have been intended to guard its <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hed Form of Government</HI> here, as well as at home. But how could the Canon be intended to guard its <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hed Form,</HI> where no Form is e&s;tabli&s;hed? The Canon was evidently de&s;igned to extend, and it can extend, no farther

than to where the Church was, or is e&s;tabli&s;hed. It may be e&s;tabli&s;hed here by the &s;ame Authority that has e&s;tabli&s;hed it at home, and yet under a different <HI>Form,</HI> in many Re&s;pects, without <HI>im|peaching</HI> or <HI>depraving</HI> any Part of the E&s;tabli&s;hment which it has in England. For in framing Laws for the external Regulation of a Church, as well as of any other Society, Reference ought always to be had to the Circum&s;tances of the Country, and the Opinions or Prejudices that generally prevail in the Minds of People. On this Account, the Government of the Church may require one mode of Admini&s;tration in England, and another here; and &s;uch a Difference will be no <HI>Impeachment</HI> on either Side. For while it is allowed, that a certain Mode of Admini&s;tration is the fite&s;t for that Coun|try in which it obtains; it is no Reflection to &s;ay, that it is not fit for a different Country, with a View to which it was never framed. The pre&s;ent eccle&s;ia&s;tical Government in England, although perhaps in &s;ome Points capable of Improvement, yet, upon the whole, may be better adapted to that Kingdom, than any other Form that can be devi&s;ed. At the &s;ame Time, the Epi&s;copate pro|po&s;ed for America, may be fiter for America, than &s;uch an Epi&s;copate as is e&s;tabli&s;hed in England. In the&s;e Ca&s;es, the American Epi&s;copate will imply no Reflection upon the Engli&s;h Epi&s;copate, nor the Engli&s;h upon the American; as each may be be&s;t fited, in &s;uch different Countries, to an&s;wer the great Ends of the general Appointment.</P>
<P>THE Church of England claims to her&s;elf a Right, and &s;he allows the &s;ame to all Churches, to regulate or alter the <HI>Externals</HI> of Religion, as Cir|cum&s;tances may require. Previou&s;ly to the Settle|ment

of eccle&s;ia&s;tical Matters &s;oon after the Ac|ce&s;&s;ion of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> this Point was fully canva&s;&s;ed; and at a public Di&s;putation between the prote&s;tant and popi&s;h Divines, the former con|tended for and &s;upported this Propo&s;ition&mdash;
<Q>that every particular Church hath Authority to in&s;ti|tute, change and abrogate Ceremonies and Rites of the Church (meaning every Thing belonging to its Wor&s;hip or Di&s;cipline that is not e&s;&s;ential) &s;o that it be to Edification<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Strype's <HI>Annals,</HI> p. 92, and <HI>Appendix,</HI> p. 40.</NOTE>.</Q>
Accordingly the Doctrine of this Propo&s;ition was &s;oon after brought into <HI>Art.</HI> xxxiv.
<Q>It is not nece&s;&s;ary, &s;ays the Article, that Traditions and Ceremonies be in all Places one or utterly like, for at all Times they have been diver&s;e, and may be changed <HI>accor|ding to the Diver&s;ity of Country and Men's Man|ners,</HI> &s;o that nothing be ordained contrary to God's Word.&mdash;Every particular or national Church hath Authority to ordain, change and aboli&s;h Ceremonies or Rites of the Church, ordained only by Men's Authority; &s;o that all Things be done to edifying.</Q>
The &s;ame Lan|guage is u&s;ed in the Preface to the Book of Common Prayer e&s;tabli&s;hed by 14 CHARLES II, and in many other Places. According therefore to the Doctrine of the Church of England,
<Q>the Diver&s;ity of Country and Men's Manners</Q>
may be a &s;ufficient Rea&s;on, for &s;ettling an Epi&s;copate in America under differ|ent Regulations, and a different external Form, from what may be e&s;teemed preferable in England.</P>
<P>WERE the Circum&s;tances of this Country the &s;ame with tho&s;e of England, an Epi&s;copate of the &s;ame Kind with that in England would have been the Object of our Plan; for we believe, as the
<PB N="154" REF="012007_0161_0F893FB9EF91E310">
Legi&s;lature at home believe, that &s;uch an Epi&s;|copate is be&s;t fited for &s;uch a Country. Were the Circum&s;tances of England the &s;ame with tho&s;e of the Colonies, &s;uch an Epi&s;copate as would be be&s;t for the Colonies, would al&s;o be be&s;t for the Mo|ther-Country. In that Ca&s;e, I confe&s;s, it would be <HI>an idle Thing to &s;ay,</HI>
<Q>that Circum&s;tances in America require that the Externals of an Epi&s;|copate &s;hould be under a Regulation peculiar to this Country.</Q>
But he that cannot &s;ee that the Circum&s;tances of the Two Countries are widely different, mu&s;t be blind with a Witne&s;s; and he that can argue for the Propriety of any Mode or external Form under certain Circum&s;tances, be|cau&s;e it is proper under different Circum&s;tances, is <HI>idle</HI> indeed. Strange! that the Doctor, who can frequently make Di&s;tinctions where there is no Difference, &s;hould not be able to di&s;tingui&s;h &s;o glaring a Difference!</P>
<P>BUT we are told, that <HI>no Circum&s;tances, unle&s;s tho&s;e of a meer worldly Nature, which have nothing to do with a purely &s;piritual Kingdom, can make it fit, &s;uitable or rea&s;onable, that the Mode of an Epi&s;|copate &s;hould be different</HI> (here) <HI>from what it is at home,</HI> p. 120. It may be &s;aid, in the like Strain, that no Circum&s;tances, but tho&s;e of a mere wordly Nature, which have nothing to do with a purely &s;piritual Kingdom, can make it rea&s;onable or fit, that the Mode of &s;upporting the Clergy here, &s;hould be different from what it is at home, namely, by Tithes. This Propo&s;ition is in the &s;ame Style with the Doctor's, and is as unexceptionable as his. The &s;piritual Kingdom of Chri&s;t is indeed not <HI>of</HI> this World; yet it exi&s;ts <HI>in</HI> the World, and as the Subjects of it are not <HI>pure Spirits,</HI> like the Bi&s;hops
<PB N="155" REF="012007_0162_0F893FBAB1C78BA8">
the Doctor allows us, it may be greatly affected by the Things of this World. But I will not enlarge on &s;o plain a Subject. If the Epi&s;copate now propo&s;ed, would be better received, and probably have a better Effect in America, than the Engli&s;h Epi&s;copate; it is, of the two, the fiter for this Country. It is of no Con&s;equence in this Debate, whether the Fitne&s;s ari&s;es from Con&s;iderations that are <HI>purely &s;piritual,</HI> or not. Fitne&s;s is Fitne&s;s; Rea&s;onablene&s;s is Rea&s;onablene&s;s; and whatever is fit and rea&s;onable to be done, ought always to be done. It is therefore &s;ubmitted to the Reader's Judgment, whether the Plan for an American Epi&s;copate which has been offered to the Public, has any Tendency to <HI>impeach</HI> or <HI>deprave</HI> the e&s;tab|li&s;hed Government of the Church of England&mdash; any more, than a particular Mode of maintaining the Clergy in one Country, is an Impeachment of a different Mode of maintaining them in another Country.</P>
<P>AFTER all, what is this to the Doctor, or his Adherents? Are he and they, on a &s;udden, become &s;o friendly, as to de&s;ire that the Advocates for the Epi&s;copate in Que&s;tion may not incur the Penalty of a Canon? He, good Man, &s;eems to be under great Concern for us on this Account. We are obliged to him for his <HI>Friend&s;hip</HI>; but he may &s;pare him&s;elf all his Unea&s;ine&s;s, as we are &s;afe without it.</P>
<P>HIS <HI>Fulminations</HI> hitherto have re&s;embled that di&s;tant Cannonading, which often precedes and introduces a clo&s;e Engagement, where Noi&s;e and Smoak are the mo&s;t that is expected. But now he proceeds to immediate Action. His Five capital
<PB N="156" REF="012007_0163_0F893FBC590A4F10">
Objections, like &s;o many &s;tanding Batteries formerly erected, he again brings to <HI>bear</HI> upon the Plan that has been advanced&mdash;but, with what Force and Execution, will &s;hortly appear from a di&s;tinct View of each.</P>
<P>OBJECTION 1. <HI>The Government and Di&s;cipline of the Church of England, under the propo&s;ed American Epi&s;copate, is injurious both to the Church, and the Bi&s;hops that are to pre&s;ide over it,</HI> p. 121. He thought it injurious to the Church, becau&s;e it was to have no immediate Effect upon the Laity. To this it was an&s;wered:
<Q>If the Laity are not to be affected by the Bi&s;hop's Authority, they are cer|tainly not to be injured by it; that, which does not operate at all, producing no Effect, either injurious or beneficial<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Appeal defended,</HI> p. 206.</NOTE>.</Q>
He now a&s;ks: <HI>Is this a fit An&s;wer for public View?</HI> It was offered as &s;uch, and I &s;ee no Rea&s;on to be a&s;hamed of it. <HI>No one,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>I believe, before the Doctor ever &s;aid, it was not injurious to deprive the Laity of a &s;piritual Privilege they are &s;uppo&s;ed to be intitled to, and by a Grant from Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> For my Part, I believe Dr. Chauncy is the fir&s;t, that ever talked of <HI>depri|ving</HI> Men of what they never had in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. If the not be&s;towing a Favour may be called a <HI>Deprivation,</HI> it may be &s;aid of him, that he has been deprived of the Bi&s;hoprick of London.</P>
<P>THE <HI>&s;piritual Privilege,</HI> of which he &s;uppo&s;es the American Laity to be <HI>deprived</HI> by our Plan, is that of being immediately under the Government of Bi&s;hops; but if they are not de&s;irous of being under &s;uch Government, they certainly cannot con|&s;ider it, nor ought it to be mentioned, in the
<PB N="157" REF="012007_0164_0F893FBCEECDEB18">
Light of a <HI>Privilege.</HI> The Doctor often &s;peaks of eccle&s;ia&s;tical Di&s;cipline, as only the Rule for pu|ni&s;hing, or the Puni&s;hment it&s;elf, of eccle&s;ia&s;tical Delinquents; according to which U&s;e of the Word, the Privilege for which he contends, in Behalf of the American Laity, is <HI>the Privilege of being pu|ni&s;hed</HI> for their Offences. So that his <HI>Privilege</HI> is of as new and extraordinary a Nature, as his <HI>De|privation.</HI> For tell a Criminal of his <HI>Privilege</HI> of receiving public Correction, and he will take it as an In&s;ult. If the Doctor had contended for eccle&s;ia&s;|tical Puni&s;hment, which he means by the Word <HI>Di&s;cipline,</HI> as a <HI>Benefit</HI> to the Church in general, or &s;ometimes even to the Delinquents them&s;elves, and not as a <HI>Privilege</HI> to the Sufferers, he might have been free from Ab&s;urdity.</P>
<P>THIS Matter of Di&s;cipline &s;eems to have been &s;trangely mi&s;under&s;tood, or mi&s;repre&s;ented, by my Opponent. It is not propo&s;ed that the American Laity of the Church of England, after the Settle|ment of an Epi&s;copate, &s;hall be under no eccle&s;i|a&s;tical Di&s;cipline at all; for they are not &s;o at pre|&s;ent. It is the Duty of the Clergy now, and it will be con&s;idered as their Duty under the propo&s;ed Epi&s;copate, to make U&s;e of public and private Admonition, and to repel from the holy Commu|nion, as Ca&s;es may require; and it does not ap|pear, that a more &s;evere Di&s;cipline than this, would, in the pre&s;ent Age, and in this Country, tend to Edification. The Enemies of the Church of En|gland reproached the E&s;tabli&s;hment of it by Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> with the Neglect of Di&s;cipline; but its celebrated <HI>Apologi&s;t</HI> maintained in An&s;wer to them, that She was guilty of no criminal Neglect in this Re&s;pect.
<Q><HI>Nos&mdash;quantum his Moribus et Tempo|ribus,</HI>
<PB N="158" REF="012007_0165_0F893FBDAF365978">
&amp;c. <HI>i. e.</HI> as far as the pre&s;ent Times, and the pre&s;ent State of Manners, in this Age of general Corruption, will <HI>admit of,</HI> we do care|fully admini&s;ter eccle&s;ia&s;tical Di&s;cipline<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bp. Jewel'<HI>s Apology.</HI> p. 66.</NOTE>.</Q>
This he thought a &s;ufficient Ju&s;tification of the Church of England; not imagining that She was obliged to make U&s;e of a &s;everer Di&s;cipline than the Times would admit of. The &s;ame Plea is offered for the Epi&s;copate propo&s;ed for the Colonies. As much Di&s;cipline over the Laity as the State of this Country will admit of, is in the Hands of the Clergy; and therefore more will not be introduced by the Bi&s;hops of our Plan. Con&s;equently, <HI>in this Re&s;pect,</HI> they will not be <HI>immediately</HI> beneficial to the Laity. However, as they will probably cau&s;e &s;ome of the Clergy to be more attentive to their Duty in general than they would otherwi&s;e be, and to that of Di&s;cipline, as well as others; in this Way they will be really beneficial to the Laity, by the In&s;trumentality of the Clergy.</P>
<P>UNDER this Objection the Doctor urged, that our Plan would be <HI>injurious to the Bi&s;hops</HI> propo&s;ed, by re&s;training their Power. It was an&s;wered, that if &s;uch a Re&s;triction was not injurious to the Church, it could be no Injury to the Bi&s;hops. I could not conceive of the Authority of Bi&s;hops, under the Notion of &s;o much <HI>private Property</HI> be|longing to them; in Con&s;equence of which every Limitation of their Authority would be &s;o much <HI>Damage</HI> &s;u&s;tained by the Bi&s;hops. This was men|tioned as an ab&s;urdity attending the Doctor's Po&s;i|tion. He now refers to it, not as a &s;uppo&s;ed Ab|&s;urdity of his, but as a Principle of mine; and makes a Flouri&s;h in the following abu&s;ive Excla|mation:
<PB N="159" REF="012007_0166_0F893FBE6F105318">
<HI>It is amazing, one of the Doctor's Cha|racter &s;hould not be able to &s;ee, that Bi&s;hops were</HI> (are) <HI>capable of &s;u&s;taining Damage in other Ways be|&s;ides that of being touched in their private Property.</HI> p. 123.</P>
<P>TO what was &s;aid on this Subject in the <HI>Appeal defended,</HI> which &s;tands in full Force notwith&s;tand|ing the Doctor's Attempt to weaken it, I will now add, as worthy of his Attention, the following Con|&s;iderations. The epi&s;copal Order has Authority, given by Chri&s;t, to govern the Church. This Au|thority extends to all the Members of the Church, the Laity as well as Clergy; but its <HI>immediate</HI> Ac|tion or Operation was chiefly intended to take Place upon the Clergy. The Di&s;cipline of the Church, &s;o far as the Laity are its immediate Ob|jects, has always been exerci&s;ed by the parochial Clergy, except in &s;ome extrordinary Ca&s;es, and not by the Bi&s;hops in their own Per&s;ons. It appears therefore, that no great Innovation will be the Con&s;equence of our Plan; it being intended only to provide, that no new Di&s;cipline over the Laity &s;hall be introduced into America, nor the common Di&s;cipline exerci&s;ed by different Per&s;ons, under the propo&s;ed Epi&s;copate. And where it is &s;aid that the Bi&s;hop's
<Q>Authority &s;hall operate only upon the Clergy of the Church, and not upon the Laity;</Q>
the Meaning is, that it &s;hall operate only upon the Clergy as its immediate Objects, and that others can have no Rea&s;on to dread its Effects. Not that the epi&s;copal Authority over the Laity &s;hall be intirely &s;u&s;pended; for when the parochial Clergy exerci&s;e an Authority, given them by the Bi&s;hops, and under their Superintendency, it is an Exerci&s;e of the Bi&s;hop's Authority. What a Bi|&s;hop
<PB N="160" REF="012007_0167_0F893FBF2FD71200">
does properly and effectually by Means of his &s;ubordinate Officers, is his own Act; and there is no ju&s;t Room to complain, that the Bi&s;hops of the <HI>Appeal</HI> are injured, by being dive&s;ted of all Authority over the Laity. The Authority given by Chri&s;t to Bi&s;hops ought always to be exerci&s;ed in &s;uch a Manner, as may be&s;t an&s;wer its original Intention, of which they are the proper Judges. If the Governors of the Church had not &s;ome di&s;|cretionary Power in Matters of this Nature, in many Ca&s;es the Exerci&s;e of their Authority would tend more to De&s;truction than to Edification, and thus defeat its own End.</P>
<P>OBJECTION II. <HI>The Bi&s;hops in this Plan are &s;o widely different from the Bi&s;hops of the Church of England at home, that it is not rea&s;onable they &s;hould be de&s;ired or &s;ent,</HI> p. 124. In An&s;wer to this it was &s;aid,
<Q>the Bi&s;hops in this Plan are <HI>e&s;&s;entially</HI> the &s;ame with the Bi&s;hops at home, how widely &s;oever they may differ in &s;ome Circum&s;tances.</Q>
So far as they differ from the Bi&s;hops in England, they are <HI>more</HI> adapted to the State of the Colonies, and are proportionably <HI>more</HI> to be <HI>de&s;ired</HI> than &s;uch Bi&s;hops; the Difference being propo&s;ed for this very End, that they may be rendered more de|&s;irable in this Country. And I ob&s;erved to this Objector, in Words that have not e&s;caped his Notice, that
<Q>let them be ever &s;o different, if &s;uch Bi&s;hops as are propo&s;ed are fiter for the Colonies, than &s;uch Bi&s;hops as are in England, and the Doctor will hardly &s;ay they are not; then it may be rea&s;onable that they &s;hould be both de&s;ired and &s;ent<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Appeal defended.</HI> p. 207.</NOTE>.</Q>
But behold here, another Curio&s;ity in the Regions of Controver&s;y! The Doctor replies in
<PB N="161" REF="012007_0168_0F893FBFEE261640">
the&s;e remarkable Words: <HI>The plain An&s;wer is, they are not fiter for the Colonies, than</HI>&mdash;(than what? I dare &s;ay every Reader expects the next Words to be, <HI>&s;uch Bi&s;hops as are in England.</HI> But no &s;uch Matter; for thus it is in my Copy, than) <HI>for the Mother Country.</HI> See here, in a prote&s;tant Divine, an In&s;tance of Je&s;uitical Sophi&s;try, that is worthy of a FILIUCIUS or an ESCOBAR! The Bi&s;hops pro|po&s;ed were &s;aid to be fiter for this Country, than &s;uch Bi&s;hops as are in England would be; but they were not &s;aid to be fiter for the Colonies than they are for England, although this be undoubtedly the Ca&s;e. The Propo&s;ition that I advanced, this accompli&s;hed Di&s;putant was unable to deny; but in the Place of it he denied a Propo&s;ition that I had not advanced, that he might <HI>appear</HI> to contradict me.</P>
<P>UNDER this Branch of the Objection, the Doctor in&s;i&s;ted, that it was unrea&s;onable for <HI>a comparative Handful of epi&s;copal Profe&s;&s;ors</HI> in the Colonies to expect, <HI>that the Powers and Appendages of Bi&s;hops &s;hould be &s;o mightily abridged</HI> in Favour of them; when <HI>the Di&s;&s;enters in England,</HI> and others who de&s;ired it, could not obtain this Gratification at home. To this I gave no particular An&s;wer, as the &s;ame Point had been already con&s;idered, and what had been &s;aid was, in my Opinion, a full An&s;wer to it. <HI>But</HI> WHERE (this was con&s;idered) &s;ays the Doctor, <HI>he has not told us; nor can I find that he has any where given &s;uch an An&s;wer, or even attempted it,</HI> p. 125. As I frequently find Rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, that he has never read, with proper Attention, the Pieces he undertakes to refute, I &s;hall not que&s;tion the Truth of what is here a&s;|&s;erted, namely, that he knows not <HI>where</HI> I had
<PB N="162" REF="012007_0169_0F893FC190DD0FF8">
obviated the Remark under Con&s;ideration. And as I am willing to give him any friendly A&s;&s;i&s;tance he may think him&s;elf intitled to a&s;k, I will inform him, that I had Reference in particular to p. 113, preceeding; for the Pertinency and Force of which, I appeal to every Reader, one only excepted.</P>
<P>THE Doctor al&s;o complains, that I took no No|tice of what he &s;aid, concerning the Incon&s;i&s;tency of our Plan with the Doctrine of <HI>Uniformity,</HI> which is, <HI>made &s;o important a Matter in the Church of England.</HI> I a&s;&s;ure him, that whatever in his <HI>An&s;wer</HI> I pa&s;&s;ed by without Notice, was omitted, either from an Opinion that it had been already obviated, or that it did not de&s;erve particular Notice. It was on the latter of the&s;e Accounts, that I made no Remarks upon the Pa&s;&s;age referred to. And here I will only ob&s;erve by the Bye, that Unifor|mity is not more &s;trenuou&s;ly required by the Church of England, than by every other national Church. An Uniformity of Wor&s;hip and Doctrine, and even of Di&s;cipline in all its <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> Parts, with what is e&s;tabli&s;hed in England, will be maintained in the Church of England in the Colonies, under the propo&s;ed Epi&s;copate. And as to the Difference in the <HI>Appendages</HI> of our Bi&s;hops, it will be no greater than has lately been proved, from the 34th Article&mdash;that, in the Opinion of the Church of England,
<Q>Diver&s;ity of Countries and Men's Manners</Q>
will ju&s;tify.</P>
<P>IT was farther objected, <HI>that if Bi&s;hops &s;hould be &s;ent to the Colonies, with the&s;e re&s;trained Powers</HI> (as mentioned in the Plan) <HI>unde&s;irable Con&s;equences might be naturally feared, both here and at home.</HI> The Con&s;equence to be dreaded here, was &s;aid to
<PB N="163" REF="012007_0170_0F893FC22EA63ED8">
be, <HI>that the Bi&s;hops would throw off this Re&s;traint as &s;oon as might be,</HI> &amp;c. In An&s;wer to this it was ob&s;erved, that Men's endeavouring to free them|&s;elves from Re&s;traint, is no ju&s;t Rea&s;on why they &s;hould not be re&s;trained, on proper Occa&s;ions. It was al&s;o ob&s;erved, that no Unea&s;ine&s;s under &s;uch a Re&s;traint was ju&s;tly to be apprehended in our American Bi&s;hops; for as they will know what to expect before they accept of the Office, there can be no Di&s;appointment. I then proceeded in the following Words, which I beg Leave to tran|&s;cribe; becau&s;e I think them a &s;ufficient An&s;wer not only to all that was objected under this Head, but to all the Doctor now &s;ays in Support of his Objection.
<Q>Why &s;hould they (the American Bi&s;hops) be unea&s;y, becau&s;e the Bi&s;hops at home are inve&s;ted with civil Authority? The Bi&s;hops at home may be as properly unea&s;y and re&s;tle&s;s, becau&s;e they are not, like &s;ome of their Order on the Continent of Europe, &s;overeign Princes. Perhaps the Unea&s;ine&s;s of American Bi&s;hops may be &s;uppo&s;ed to ari&s;e from the Reflection, that de&s;titute as they are of civil Power, they are Bi|&s;hops of the &s;ame Church with their Brethren in England. But they will not be able to avoid the farther Reflection, that they are Bi&s;hops of the &s;ame Church in <HI>different</HI> Countries, and under <HI>different</HI> Circum&s;tances; which e&s;&s;entially alters the Ca&s;e. And no better Rea&s;on can be given, why they &s;hould not be contented with le&s;s Power than belongs to the Bi&s;hops in England, than why the other Bi&s;hops in England &s;hould not be con|tented with le&s;s Power than belongs to the Bi&s;hop of Durham.

<P>IN Reply to this Illu&s;tration, the Doctor &s;ays: <HI>The Fact here &s;uppo&s;ed is, I believe, &s;trictly true, that the Clergy of the Church of England will never be ea&s;y until they may have &s;ecured to them&s;elves from our E&s;tates here, what will be, in &s;ub&s;tantial Signification, the &s;ame Thing with the Tithes in En|gland.</HI> p. 129. I believe that the Clergy, of what|ever Denomination, as well as Men, of whatever Station in Life, will not, and cannot, be ea&s;y, without a <HI>competent</HI> Maintenance. And I agree with the Doctor, that a competent Maintenance in one Way, is, <HI>in &s;ub&s;tantial Signification,</HI> much the &s;ame Thing with a competent Maintenance in any other Way. But &s;omething &s;eems to be here in&s;inuated, to the peculiar Di&s;advantage of the epi&s;copal Clergy in the Colonies, as if they were apt to be more re&s;tle&s;s, unea&s;y and rapacious, than other Men; or, at lea&s;t, than the Clergy of other Denominations. But &s;uch an In&s;inuation is not more illiberal than unju&s;t <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">To &s;hew that one Eccle&s;ia&s;tic is not always innocent of the Crimes of which he accu&s;es others, and to give a little Relaxation to the Reader, who may be fatigued with travel|ing through &s;o many dry Pages of Controver&s;y, I beg Leave to introduce the following Ancedote. Bilibaldus Pirckhei|merus, the great Friend of Era&s;mus, in a Company where much was &s;aid in Commendation of him, took Notice that a certain <HI>Mendicant Monk,</HI> di&s;covered, by his Countenance and Ge&s;tures, that he was greatly di&s;&s;atisfied with the Encomiums that pa&s;&s;ed.
<Q>And being hard pu&s;hed to declare what he had to cen&s;ure in Era&s;mus, he &s;aid, that this Man, whom they affected to extol &s;o much, was a notorious <HI>Eater of Fowls</HI>; and that he knew it to be true, not from the Te&s;|timony of others, but of his own Eyes. Did Era&s;mus buy them, or &s;teal them? Said Pirckheimer. He bought them, &s;aid the Monk.&mdash;But is it then a Sin to eat Fowls? Mo&s;t certainly, an&s;wered the Monk: It is the Sin of Gluttony; and it becomes the more heinous, when it is committed and frequently repeated by Church-Men. Perhaps, &s;aid Pirckheimer, he eats them upon Fa&s;t-Days. No, &s;aid the Monk; but we Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks ought to ab&s;tain upon all Days from &s;uch Delicacies. Ah, my good Father, &s;aid Pirckheimer, it is not by eating dry Bread, that you have got that huge Paunch of yours; and if all the Fowls, which have gone into it, could lift up their Voice at once, and cackle in Concert, they would make Noi&s;e enough to drown the Drums and Trumpets of an Army <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Jortin'<HI>s Life of Era&s;mus.</HI> p. 216.</NOTE>.</Q>

from all that I know of &s;uch Matters, that it is intirely groundle&s;s. Why then &s;hould they be the Objects of any peculiar Jealou&s;y?

<P>IT was pretended that Two <HI>unde&s;ireable Con&s;e|quences</HI> would ari&s;e at home, from granting to the Colonies the Epi&s;copate reque&s;ted. One is, that <HI>va&s;t Numbers</HI> of People there, meaning the Di&s;|&s;enters and di&s;affected Members of the Church, would <HI>think them&s;elves hardly treated,</HI> when they found &s;uch an Epi&s;copate granted to the Ameri|cans,
<PB N="166" REF="012007_0173_0F893FC46EAF9960">
as has been refu&s;ed to them. I think them very <HI>hardly treated</HI> by &s;uch an Objection as this; wherein they are repre&s;ented as a Set of peevi&s;h and unrea&s;onable People, di&s;po&s;ed to behave weak|ly, ab&s;urdly and perver&s;ely, and in a Manner gro&s;sly unworthy of Men and of Chri&s;tians. They are here &s;uppo&s;ed, in the fir&s;t Place, to prefer &s;uch an Epi&s;copate as is propo&s;ed for the Colonies, to the Epi&s;copate in England&mdash;then, to have applied for &s;uch an Epi&s;copate them&s;elves, which has been refu&s;ed them&mdash;and la&s;tly, becau&s;e they cannot ob|tain it in England, to be unwilling that the Ame|ricans &s;hould have it. The Doctor may be better acquainted with the Genius and Di&s;po&s;ition of tho&s;e People than I am; but I can hardly believe &s;uch an unfavorable Repre&s;entation of them to be ju&s;t, at lea&s;t, without many Exceptions.</P>
<P>IN making this Objection, I thought my Op|ponent had forgotten his proper Bu&s;ine&s;s and Cha|racter; which was to an&s;wer the <HI>Appeal,</HI> upon the Principles of the Di&s;&s;enters in this Country. Now if we may judge of them from their Writers, they would willingly inflame, rather than allay, the Di&s;content at home with the pre&s;ent eccle&s;ia&s;tical E&s;tabli&s;hment; and therefore they cannot con&s;i&s;|tently object, that the Execution of our Plan would increa&s;e that Di&s;content, or, in other Words, pro|duce an Effect which they wi&s;h to &s;ee.

The Remark <HI>here</HI> was proper and pertinent; and by introducing it in this Place, I meant not to confine it to this particular Objection. And I expre&s;sly &s;aid, that the Doctor mi&s;took his proper Bu&s;ine&s;s,

not only where it was then pointed out, but IN MANY OTHER PLACES <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Appeal defended.</HI> p. 209.</NOTE>. The <HI>former Objection</HI> was &s;o glaring an In&s;tance of this Mi&s;management, that it was needle&s;s to mention it.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING, the Doctor thinks he had a Right to make Objections upon any Principles, <HI>as Objections of all Kinds were called for.</HI> But who called for <HI>all Kinds</HI> of Objections, in the Latitude wherein he has produced them? <HI>i. e.</HI> For good, bad and indifferent; pertinent and impertinent; con&s;i&s;tent and incon&s;i&s;tent; rea&s;onable and unrea|&s;onable? I will undertake to an&s;wer for the Au|thor of the <HI>Appeal,</HI> that he did not. But if, in Fact, he had made &s;o ab&s;urd a Propo&s;al, the Doc|tor &s;hould have had more Di&s;cretion than to have accepted of it. But to clear him&s;elf partly from the Charge of Incon&s;i&s;tency, he informs us, that he and tho&s;e who are commonly called <HI>Di&s;&s;enters, are in real Earne&s;t that the epi&s;copal Laity may not be impo&s;ed on by their planning Clergy</HI>&mdash;and that the De&s;ign of the Objection was <HI>to &s;erve them.</HI> It appears to me that the Account would have been far more ju&s;t and candid, had he &s;aid, that he and his Ad|herents were <HI>in real Earne&s;t,</HI> to excite, in the Minds of the <HI>epi&s;copal Laity,</HI> a Jealou&s;y, that their Cler|gy have combined to impo&s;e upon and deceive them. For, I believe, it is not &s;o much Friend|&s;hip to the Laity, as Enmity to the Clergy, that has cau&s;ed them to be &s;o mightily <HI>in Earne&s;t. Their planning Clergy!</HI> How often mu&s;t this Ob|jector be told, that the Epi&s;copate in Que&s;tion was never <HI>planned</HI> by the American Clergy? It was &s;hewn in the <HI>Appeal,</HI> that it was planned by others; and that the Plan is no otherwi&s;e ours, than as we
<PB N="168" REF="012007_0175_0F893FC6D3CF3290">
we have adopted it, and are de&s;irous of promoting it. But what is wor&s;t of all, he &s;ays it was <HI>a Scheme they had contrived</HI> FOR THEIR OWN SAKES. They mu&s;t have been wretched <HI>Contrivers,</HI> if in forming <HI>a Scheme for their own Sakes,</HI> they could project no other Advantage to them&s;elves, than that of being more &s;trictly governed, and the Doctor's PRIVILEGE <HI>of being puni&s;hed</HI> when they do ami&s;s. That the Clergy have been influenced by mercenary Motives, in their Application for Bi|&s;hops, is as groundle&s;s and unju&s;t a Reproach as Malice can invent. If ever a <HI>di&s;intere&s;ted</HI> and be|nevolent Re&s;olution was formed by any Body of Men; this of our Clergy, to &s;olicit and promote an Epi&s;copate, calculated to bring them&s;elves un|der Re&s;traint, without the lea&s;t Pro&s;pect of per&s;o|nal Advantage, and with a View only to the In|tere&s;t of Religion, is fairly intitled to this glorious Character. The whole Plan is laid before the Pub|lic; let the Public judge of it, and &s;ay&mdash;whether the Ea&s;e, or the Wealth, or Authority of the Cler|gy, can be the Object in View. Jealou&s;y, Envy, and a gloomy Tribe of malevolent Pa&s;&s;ions, are always ready to entertain unfavorable Su&s;picions; but the Su&s;picion, in this Ca&s;e, has not the lea&s;t Appearance of Evidence to &s;upport it. The Cler|gy therefore, con&s;cious of the Rectitude of their Aims, will be neither detered nor di&s;concerted by any Abu&s;es they may receive from the Enemies of the Church; but they will &s;teadily pur&s;ue, and per&s;evere in pur&s;uing, what they judge to be their Duty with Regard to an Epi&s;copate, through evil Report and good Report.</P>
<P>IN dealing with one Branch of this general Ob|jection, I expre&s;&s;ed what I took to be the Sen&s;e of
<PB N="169" REF="012007_0176_0F893FC76F069AD0">
it in my own Words; in which I did not other Harm, than to expre&s;s it in &s;tronger Terms than were u&s;ed by the Doctor. In &s;peaking of the Di&s;|&s;enters at home, he &s;aid they would <HI>think them|&s;elves hardly treated</HI>; this I expre&s;&s;ed by their being <HI>clamorous,</HI> &s;ub&s;tituting <HI>noi&s;y Words</HI> for <HI>hard Thoughts,</HI> which was no great Di&s;advantage to his Argument. However, he &s;ays, and in Strictne&s;s of Speech it is true, that <HI>it was not mentioned as an Objection that Di&s;&s;enters at home would</HI>
<Q>grow more <HI>clamo|rous</HI> in Con&s;equence of the Settlement of the propo&s;ed Epi&s;copate.</Q>
But he is al&s;o of Opini|on, that there was no <HI>ju&s;t Foundation</HI> for my &s;ub|&s;tituting the Word <HI>clamorous</HI>; and that there is a <HI>wide Difference</HI> between the Di&s;&s;enters being <HI>clama|rous,</HI> and their <HI>thinking them&s;elves hardly treated.</HI> The two Things, it is confe&s;&s;ed, are different in them&s;elves, and in &s;ome Ca&s;es &s;hould be carefully di&s;tingui&s;hed; but it appears from the Hi&s;tory of the Engli&s;h Di&s;&s;enters, that <HI>with them</HI> there is &s;uch a clo&s;e Connection between their thinking them&s;elves hardly treated, and their being <HI>clamorous,</HI> that mi&s;taking the former for the latter is very excu&s;a|ble. I &s;peak not of Individuals; there are un|doubtedly many among them of amiable and excel|lent Characters; who are mild, gentle and peace|able; and who would &s;uffer much, before they would make any public Di&s;turbance, or act any Way di&s;re&s;pectfully towards Government. But hi|therto, this has not been the <HI>general</HI> Character of the Party.</P>
<P>WHAT was ab&s;urdly put into the Mouth of the Di&s;&s;enters, I allowed that &s;ome others might con|&s;i&s;tently &s;ay; and for their Satisfaction, I thought it &s;ufficient to refer them to what had been offered
<PB N="170" REF="012007_0177_0F893FC8305CFF28">
<Q>to this Purpo&s;e&mdash;viz. That &s;uch an Epi&s;copate might be erected here with ea&s;e; but it cannot be effected in England, without &s;ubverting an E&s;tabli&s;hment, and making a very vi&s;ible Altera|tion in the national Con&s;titution&mdash;a Work never to be undertaken but in the greate&s;t Extremity, and even then, not without a trembling Hand.</Q>
The Doctor tells us, all this is a Mi&s;take. <HI>The propo&s;ed Epi&s;copate could not be erected here with that Ea&s;e that is in&s;inuated.</HI> But certainly it can be erected here with Ea&s;e, in a comparative Sen&s;e; <HI>i. e.</HI> with le&s;s Difficulty than would attend the Set|tlement of an Epi&s;copate in any other Form. It will meet with no Oppo&s;ition from the Friends and Members of the Church; and as to Oppo&s;ition from tho&s;e who have no Concern with it, it is un|rea&s;onable and pragmatical, and not to be regarded.</P>
<P>AND as 'to &s;ubverting an E&s;tabli&s;hment,' and making
<Q>a vi&s;ible Alteration in the national Con&s;ti|tution,</Q>
the Doctor &s;ees no Difficulty in the Mat|ter &mdash;it is one of the ea&s;ie&s;t Things in Nature. Some People may think the Subver&s;ion of the na|tional E&s;tabli&s;hment to be a <HI>good</HI> Work, and per|haps a <HI>plea&s;ant</HI> Work; but I believe this Writer is &s;ingular in thinking it an <HI>ea&s;y</HI> Work. It is &s;ur|pri&s;ing, that he has not &s;een enough with his own Eyes, to convince him of the Gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of this Mi&s;take. Has he never known of Attempts to introduce Innovations in <HI>&s;mall</HI> Matters, where Re|ligion was thought to be concerned, that have been attended with violent Conte&s;ts, and have ended in incurable Schi&s;ms? Has he never heard of Con|gregations that have been torn in Pieces, by the Endeavors of &s;ome, to &s;ub&s;titute a new and better Ver&s;ion of the P&s;alms, for In&s;tance, in the Place
<PB N="171" REF="012007_0178_0F893F83F2DDB698">
of an old one? And does he think that a general religious E&s;tabli&s;hment, to which the greater Part of the Nation is firmly attached, will be given up with more Ea&s;e, than a &s;ingle Congregation can be per&s;uaded to part with, or exchange, a Matter of but trifling Con&s;equence? It &s;eems to be almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible that he can be &s;erious, when he talks at this Rate. He concludes this labored Paragraph with telling the Public, that he thinks it high Time that the national Con&s;titution &s;hould be new-mo|delled: And if he could find a &s;ufficient Party to &s;upport him, I doubt not but he would undertake the Work <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> without &s;o much as

and that immediately, without a Mo|ment's He&s;itation or Delay; for, &s;ays he, <HI>the &s;oon|er the better.</HI> p. 132, 133.</P>
<P>THE other ill Con&s;equence to be dreaded at home, I will lay before the Reader in the Doctor's Words, as he thinks I did not fairly repre&s;ent it, when I undertook to expre&s;s it in Words of my own. <HI>It can &s;carce be &s;uppo&s;ed,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>it &s;hould e&s;cape the Thought of our Engli&s;h Bi&s;hops, that the Settlement of &s;uch an Epi&s;copate in America, as is propo&s;ed, may prepare the Way for &s;uch a Change in the Power of Bi&s;hops at home, as they would not be very fond of.</HI> To the Objection thus expre&s;&s;ed, it is a &s;ufficient An&s;wer to &s;ay&mdash;that the Bi&s;hops at home univer&s;ally approve of the Plan <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>The late Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury was of Opinion that

are, in Fact, under no Apprehen&s;ions on this Ac|count. But, on the other Hand, they would have ju&s;t Cau&s;e to be unea&s;y, &s;hould the propo&s;ed Ame|rican Epi&s;copate not be granted; as there would be Rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, that &s;uch a Refu&s;al proceed|ed from <HI>Hatred</HI> to the epi&s;copal Order it&s;elf&mdash;a Hatred, which in Time might overthrow them and the Church of England together, as it once did.</P>
<P>OBJECTION III. <HI>The Church of England knows no &s;uch Bi&s;hops as are &s;pecified in the Plan, nor can they, in Con&s;i&s;tency with its Con&s;titution, be &s;ent to the Colonies.</HI> p. 134. To this I gave no particular An&s;wer before, as I conceived that what had been offered on the Subject of the King's Supremacy, from which the Incon&s;i&s;tency was infered, was a full Refutation of the Objection, and of all that was &s;aid to &s;upport it. But the Doctor will not be &s;a|tisfied, without a particular An&s;wer. Let it then be ob&s;erved, that what the Church of England allows of and has provided for, it not incon&s;i&s;tent with her <HI>Con&s;titution,</HI> and what She has experienced, She may be properly &s;aid to know:&mdash;But, <HI>&s;uch Bi|&s;hops as are &s;pecified in this Plan,</HI> She allows of, has provided for, and experienced:&mdash;Therefore, &s;uch Bi&s;hops are con&s;i&s;tent with her Con&s;titution, and She is no Stranger to them. The <HI>minor</HI> Pro|po&s;ition is thus proved. The Bi&s;hops of our Plan are, and were originally called, <HI>Suffragan</HI> Bi&s;hops: &mdash;Suffragan Bi&s;hops are con&s;i&s;tent with the Con&s;titu|tion of the Church of England:&mdash;Therefore, the Bi&s;hops of our Plan are con&s;i&s;tent with her Con|&s;titution. The Act of 26 <HI>Henry</HI> VIII, Cap. 14, to which the Bi&s;hops con&s;ented, makes Provi&s;ion for Suffragans in the Church of England. Such

Af|ter the Re&s;toration, the Bi&s;hops, in An&s;wer to &s;ome Propo&s;als made by the Pre&s;byterian Divines, &s;ay, in Words which are recommended to the Doctor's particular Notice, on more Accounts than one:
<Q>We cannot grant the Extent of any Dioce&s;s is &s;o great, but that a Bi&s;hop may well perform his Duty, which is <HI>not a per&s;onal In&s;pection</HI> of every Man's Soul, but the pa&s;toral Charge, or taking Care that the Mini&s;ters, or other eccle&s;i|a&s;tical Officers within their Dioce&s;s, do their Duties; and if &s;ome Dioce&s;&s;es &s;hould be too large, <HI>the Law allows of Suffragans</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Neal<HI>'s Hi&s;t. of the Puritans.</HI> Vol. IV. p. 23<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE>.</Q>

It is evident therefore, that the Bi&s;hops of our Plan are con&s;i&s;tent with the Con&s;titution of the Church of England; and it is farther evident, that the Doctor, in talking of the&s;e Matters, be|trays his Ignorance,
<Q>under&s;tanding neither what he &s;ays, nor whereof he affirms.</Q></P>
<P>HE choo&s;es <HI>here</HI> to introduce the Subject of the King's Supremacy, although the Con&s;ideration of it more properly belonged to another Place. He brings it in here, becau&s;e it will &s;well this Part of his

Performance, wherein he profe&s;&s;es more immedi|ately to attack the Epi&s;copate in Que&s;tion. For by &s;uch a <HI>Manoeuvre</HI> the unwary Reader may be led to think, from the Number of Pages in this Sec|tion, that the Doctor has &s;aid much in direct Op|po&s;ition to the propo&s;ed Epi&s;copate; while, in Re|ality, he has &s;aid but very little that is pertinent to the Subject.</P>
<P>HE had objected, that, according to the Doc|trine of the Church of England, all eccle&s;ia&s;tical Juri&s;diction is derived from the Crown; that as to Authority purely eccle&s;ia&s;tical, there is no &s;uch Thing in the Church of England; and con&s;equent|ly, that the Bi&s;hops of the <HI>Appeal,</HI> who are de|&s;cribed as having &s;uch an Authority as
<Q>is altoge|ther derived from the Church, and not from the State,</Q>
cannot be Bi&s;hops of, nor be &s;ent by, the Church of England to America. This occa&s;ioned me to con&s;ider the Subject largely, and to make a particular Examination whether his A&s;&s;ertion were true. And to prove that he was mi&s;taken, I pro|duced a Variety of mo&s;t authentic Evidence; par|ticularly, the Explanation of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII, to the Convocation of the Province of York, the Words of the Letters Patent granted by <HI>Edward</HI> VI, Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s INJUNCTIONS, and the 37th <HI>Ar|ticle</HI> &mdash;with a brief hi&s;torical Account of the Occa|&s;ion, and Operation, of the&s;e &s;everal Declarations and Writings. And it was made abundantly evi|dent, that the Supremacy claimed by our Princes, given them by the Con&s;titution, and maintained by the Church of England, allows to our Bi&s;hops a purely &s;piritual or eccle&s;ia&s;tical Authority, which is derived, not from the Crown, but from Chri&s;t him&s;elf.</P>

He &s;ays that <HI>all</HI> I at|tempted to prove <HI>is</HI> ONLY <HI>this, that, notwith&s;tand|ing the King's Supremacy, it is from Chri&s;t, not the King, that the Authority of the Bi&s;hops, as &s;uch, in the Church of England, is conveyed to them.</HI> p. 137. This is <HI>all</HI> that I had Occa&s;ion to prove; and the Proof that I made, is &s;ufficient to overthrow one of the main Pillars that &s;upported his Oppo&s;ition to the Epi&s;copate reque&s;ted. Notwith&s;tanding, he affects to think very differently of the Matter. <HI>It is, to me,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>beyond all Doubt, that his</HI> (the Author's) <HI>Labor on this Head is altogether vain.</HI> This is ea&s;ily &s;aid in any Ca&s;e; but his Manner of &s;aying it in this Place, is ju&s;tly &s;u&s;pici|ous.

For he only repeats, and in&s;i&s;ts upon, the Words of the Statute, where all Manner of Ju|ri&s;diction is &s;aid to flow from the Crown, &amp;c. and refers to Dr. Burn'<HI>s Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Law,</HI> for the &s;eve|ral Acts of Parliament relating to the Subject. p. 138. What was meant by that, and &s;uch like Ex|pre&s;&s;ions, was explained in the <HI>Appeal defended</HI>; and it was &s;hewn that this Language was con&s;i&s;tent with the Doctrine and Belief of <HI>purely &s;piritual</HI> Power in the Church, in its &s;tricte&s;t Sen&s;e. It were ea&s;y to &s;upport, by innumerable Authorities, what I advanced upon the Subject; but again&s;t Dr. Chauncy it needs no Support. I fear not but it

will &s;tand forever, by its own Strength, notwith|&s;tanding all the Attempts he may make again&s;t it.</P>
<P><HI>SHOULD it be &s;uppo&s;ed,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>not granted, that the Authority of Bi&s;hops does not flow from the Crown, but from the Church, which is the utmo&s;t the Doctor has endeavoured to prove, it will not fol|low from hence, that he has an&s;wered, or &s;o much as attempted to an&s;wer</HI> 'all that is &s;aid in Support' <HI>of the Objection in Debate.</HI> But &s;hould it be <HI>&s;up|po&s;ed, not granted,</HI> that this is not an An&s;wer to <HI>all</HI> that was &s;aid in Support of the Objection, yet enough for the Purpo&s;e had been &s;aid in other Places; and the Reader was refered to what had been &s;aid relating to the Subject in general, with|out being limited to any particular Pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>WHAT was &s;aid to &s;upport the Objection, can|not be an&s;wered, &s;ays the Doctor, until it is &s;hewn, <HI>how that Authority is altogether from the Church, and not from the State, which can be exerci&s;ed, nei|ther in the Affair of Wor&s;hip, Ordination, Govern|ment or Di&s;cipline, but by and under the Guidance, Controul, and &s;overeignly pre&s;cribed Order, not of the Church, but of the State.</HI> p. 139. But this was <HI>&s;hewn</HI> too, and illu&s;trated, in the <HI>Appeal defended,</HI> p. 55; and in &s;uch a Manner, as, I doubt not, will be allowed by the impartial to be &s;atisfactory and convincing. The Origin of any Power is one Thing, and the Regulation or Ob&s;truction of the Exerci&s;e of that Power is another. The Doctor him&s;elf claims an eccle&s;ia&s;tical Authority, origi|nally derived from Chri&s;t; but the Exerci&s;e of it is, in &s;ome Re&s;pects, regulated by the Laws of his Country. And had it a more particular Direction from the Government than it now has, it would

&s;till be the &s;ame, as to its Nature and Origin, as it now is. So plain a Ca&s;e has but little Need of Illu&s;tration; however, with this View, I con&s;idered one particular Branch of eccle&s;ia&s;tical Authority, the Power to baptize. This Power is generally e&s;teemed to be purely eccle&s;ia&s;tical, and not derived by a Commi&s;&s;ion from the State; and yet in com|mon it cannot be exerci&s;ed by a Clergyman, with|out the Approbation and Con&s;ent of other Per&s;ons. But &s;uch Approbation alters not the Nature of the Power, nor is it the Source from whence it is derived; any more than my Con&s;ent and Submi&s;|&s;ion to the Operation of a Surgeon, is the Cau&s;e of the Skill with which he performs it. In like Manner, the epi&s;copal Authority may be altogether from the Church, and not from the State; and yet it may be guided and controlled by the State; without lo&s;ing its Nature or e&s;&s;ential Character. If the Con|&s;ent of the King or the State is nece&s;&s;ary, in Or|der to a Bi&s;hop's coming over to America, &s;o is the Con&s;ent of the Ma&s;ter of the Ship in which he comes over; and the former does not change the Nature of his Office or of his Authority, and more than the latter.

are &s;trait, becau&s;e he approves not of Things that are crooked.</P>
<P>AS to his <HI>de&s;iring</HI> no E&s;tabli&s;hment in Favour of his own religious Sentiments, I am per&s;uaded that he &s;ays it in a <HI>qualified Sen&s;e</HI>; e&s;pecially as he undertakes to expre&s;s the general Opinion of the Congregationali&s;ts in New-England. For that they had generally become, <HI>in Principle, again&s;t all E&s;|tabli&s;hments in Religion,</HI> in the common Extent of the Expre&s;&s;ion, was a Piece of Intelligence for which I was beholden to the Doctor. For, as I told him, I was in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of certain hi&s;torical Accounts and Anecdotes (&s;ince which Time I have collected more, and of a fre&s;her Date) from which one would naturally infer the contrary. However, &s;uppo&s;ing the Repre&s;entation to be ju&s;t, it may be proper &s;o ob&s;erve here, that &s;o far as the Doctor and his Friends are again&s;t E&s;tabli&s;hments, they are <HI>De&s;erters</HI> from the Principles of their Ance&s;|tors, the fir&s;t Settlers of New-England; who were not only, <HI>in Principle,</HI> for an E&s;tabli&s;hment of their own Mode of Religion, but for an E&s;ta|bli&s;hment without a Toleration. This Doctrine they received from the Puritans, who aimed at nothing le&s;s than &s;uch an E&s;tabli&s;hment in the Reign of Queen Elizabeth, as was &s;hewn from Bi|&s;hop Maddox. The Doctor denies this; and &s;ays that the Puritans are <HI>herein injuriou&s;ly mi&s;repre&s;ented</HI> by Maddox. But if &s;o, they are mi&s;repre&s;ented by all our Hi&s;torians, and even by their own Writings; and I could ea&s;ily prove, from Neal's Hi&s;tory of them, as much as is here a&s;&s;erted.</P>
<P>UPON this the Doctor is all on Fire, and his In|dignation fla&s;hes out in the following Language.

This has all along been the Way, on this Side</HI> [of] <HI>the Atlantic, in which Con|verts to the Church, e&s;pecially clerical ones, have en|deavoured to give Proof of the Sincerity of their Con|ver&s;ion.</HI> p. 141.

In one Re&s;pect at lea&s;t, the Words of this Objection make it evident, that he is a <HI>De&s;erter</HI> from them.

while he exemplifies it him&s;elf, he is condemned from his own Mouth&mdash;a much feverer Condemna|tion, than what proceeds from an Enemy. Ac|cording to my Way of thinking, the Doctor and I are under no greater Obligations to maintain all the religious Principles of our puritanical Ance&s;|tors, than the Puritans them&s;elves were, to adhere to all the Principles of their Popi&s;h Ance&s;tors. I do not mean to in&s;inuate any Compari&s;on between the Puritans and Papi&s;ts; nor to be wanting in any due Re&s;pect to the fir&s;t Settlers of New-En|gland. For it gives me Plea&s;ure to &s;ay, that I think they were, in general, Men of more Repu|tation, more Religion, and more Learning, than the original Settlers of new Colonies commonly are. But an undi&s;tingui&s;hing Fondne&s;s for all their Sentiments, and, in particular, a Ju&s;tification of their intolerant Spirit, are no Parts of that Re&s;|pect which is due to them, from the Friends of religious Liberty, although their De&s;cendants.</P>

<P>AS
<Q>the Pre&s;byterians in Scotland, and the Cal|vini&s;ts in Geneva, Holland and other Places, have always been Friends to religious E&s;tabli&s;h|ments;</Q>
I thought a full and particular Evidence was nece&s;&s;ary in Order to convince us, that the Pre&s;byterians or Calvini&s;ts in New-England have adopted a different Principle. For the more in|credible a Fact is, the &s;tronger Evidence is requi|red, in Order to prove it. Dr. Prie&s;tley is of Opi|nion, that all Denominations of Prote&s;tants, ex|cept one, are fond of E&s;tabli&s;hments in their own Favor&mdash;and of &s;omething more, viz. Of depre&s;|&s;ing all other Sects. "This I own," &s;ays he (namely Confidence in their Moderation)
<Q>is more than I could promi&s;e my&s;elf from any other Bo|dy of Chri&s;tians whatever</Q>

<Q>If I were to pray for the general Prevalence of any one Sect of Chri&s;tians, it &s;hould be that of the Quakers; becau&s;e, different as my Opinions are from theirs, I have &s;o much Confidence in their Moderation, that I believe they would let me live, write and publi&s;h what I plea&s;ed un|mole&s;ted among them.</Q>
(I &s;uppo&s;e the Church of England does not &s;uffer Dr. Prie&s;tley <HI>to live, write and publi&s;h what he plea&s;es,</HI> without Mole&s;ta|tion.)
<PB N="182" REF="012007_0189_0F893FD217F7C9B8">
<Q>And this I own, is more than I could promi&s;e my&s;elf from any other Body of Chri&s;ti|ans, whatever; <HI>the Pre&s;byterians perhaps</HI> (N. B.) LEAST OF ALL <HI>excepted</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>E&s;&s;ay</HI> on a Cour&s;e of <HI>liberal Education.</HI></NOTE>.</Q>
The Congregati|onali&s;ts in New-England therefore, in the Opinion of this Writer, mu&s;t, with Regard to E&s;tabli&s;h|ments and the Exerci&s;e of Power, differ from all other Denominations of Prote&s;tants, the Quakers excepted, and from the Pre&s;byterians <HI>perhaps mo&s;t of all,</HI> if the Doctor's Account may be credited: And how compleatly they have adopted the mild and tolerant Principles of the Quakers, the Quakers and Bapti&s;ts in New-England know by Experi|ence, and the Public has been lately told. It is a Pity that Dr. Prie&s;tley had not heard of this great Revolution in the religious Sy&s;tem of New-En|gland; for then he would not, on &s;o fair an Occa|&s;ion, have neglected to render it all due Honor.</P>
<P>DR. Chauncy &s;till affects to be terrified with an Apprehen&s;ion, that the propo&s;ed Epi&s;copate will e&s;tabli&s;h the Church of England in the Colonies. I had a&s;ked,
<Q>Does this Plan propo&s;e the E&s;ta|bli&s;hment of the Church?</Q>
He an&s;wers: <HI>It undoubtedly does.</HI> I al&s;o a&s;ked:
<Q>Will the Execu|tion of it imply, or amount to, any &s;uch Thing?</Q>
His An&s;wer is ready: <HI>Yes; or it can never be car|ried into Execution (i. e.</HI> the <HI>Execution</HI> can never be carried into Execution.) To &s;hew that no &s;uch Thing was intended or implied in the Plan, I held it up once more to public View; a&s;king, of the whole, and of all its material Parts, whether there was any Appearance of an E&s;tabli&s;hment. An An&s;wer is not wanting: <HI>Surely,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>the Doctor could not but know, before he a&s;ked the&s;e Que&s;tions,
<PB N="183" REF="012007_0190_0F893FD2BAA09F08">
that it was only a&s;king, whether we thought there was any Weight, or Force, in the produced Objection.</HI> p. 142. I &s;till in&s;i&s;t upon the Propriety of the Que&s;tions. To decide whether the Plan mention|ed or implied an E&s;tabli&s;hment or not, it was pro|per to refer to the Plan it&s;elf; that the Reader might &s;ee with his own Eyes, whether there was any &s;uch Thing:&mdash;In the &s;ame Manner, that, if a Per&s;on &s;hould affirm to me that the Sun was not ri&s;en, when I knew that it was vi&s;iblely above the Horizon, I &s;hould point to the Body of the Sun, and a&s;k if he did not &s;ee it.</P>
<P>MY logical Opponent proceeds, expre&s;&s;ing his Surprize: <HI>How unaccountable is it, that he could imagine, that he had &s;aid any Thing to the Purpo&s;e, by</HI> BARELY <HI>puting the&s;e Que&s;tions! They are really nothing more than &s;o many &s;trongly expre&s;&s;ed Affir|mations; and will he call this arguing?</HI> The put|ing <HI>proper</HI> Que&s;tions, may be &s;aying &s;omething to the Purpo&s;e, e&s;pecially when they have the Force of <HI>&s;trongly expre&s;&s;ed Affirmations.</HI> Every Affirma|tion is a Propo&s;ition; and Propo&s;itions that are pertinent to the Bu&s;ine&s;s in hand, and duly metho|dized and arranged, may ju&s;tly be called <HI>arguing.</HI> The Que&s;tions appear to me to have been perti|nent, and I conceive that I acted with no Impro|priety in the Ca&s;e. At lea&s;t, the Doctor has made none appear, nor has he attempted to invalidate what was offered directly to the Point, any farther than in the Words I have quoted. But were he able to prove, that an E&s;tabli&s;hment would be the Con&s;equence of executing our Plan, which he can|not do in any Sen&s;e; yet, unle&s;s it were &s;uch an E&s;tabli&s;hment as would tend to abridge the Liber|ties, or interfere with the Rights, of &s;ome of his
<PB N="184" REF="012007_0191_0F893FD36EC32548">
Maje&s;ty's Subjects in the Colonies, it would be un|rea&s;onable to make it an Objection. It is po&s;&s;ible, at lea&s;t in Theory, that there may be an E&s;tabli&s;h|ment of one Religion, without any ill Con&s;equences to the Profe&s;&s;ors of other Religions. Mr. Neal &s;ays:
<Q>The King may create Dignitaries, and give &s;uf|ficient Encouragement to tho&s;e of the public Religion, without invading the Liberties of his di&s;&s;enting Subjects. If religious E&s;tabli&s;hments were &s;tript of their <HI>judicial Proce&s;&s;es,</HI> and <HI>civil Juri&s;diction,</HI> no Harm could be feared from them <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. of the <HI>Puritans.</HI> Vol. IV. <HI>Pref.</HI> x.</NOTE>.</Q>
Now the Bi&s;hops propo&s;ed, whether e&s;tabli&s;hed or une&s;tabli&s;hed, are to carry on no ju|dicial Proce&s;&s;es, but again&s;t the epi&s;copal Clergy, and are not to have the lea&s;t Shadow of civil Juri&s;|diction; and therefore, according to Mr. Neal, and according to common Sen&s;e, no Harm can ju&s;tly be feared from them, by <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> of any Denomination.</P>
<P>THE Doctor had affirmed that there is no Evi|dence, <HI>that Chri&s;t has intru&s;ted the State with a Right to make religious E&s;tabli&s;hments</HI>; and argued, that if England had &s;uch a Right, &s;o had China, Turkey, &amp;c. the Con&s;equence of which he ima|gined, would, upon the whole, be more injurious than beneficial; and <HI>therefore,</HI> that States had no &s;uch Right. To &s;hew the Weakne&s;s of this Argu|ment, I applied it to the Right of private Judg|ment; and made it evident, that all he &s;aid again&s;t E&s;tabli&s;hments, might as properly be urged again&s;t Men's Right to think and judge for them&s;elves. To this he replies: <HI>Surely the Doctor does not believe, that the Right of States to make religious E&s;tabli&s;h|ments, is as clearly and indubitably a Grant from
<PB N="185" REF="012007_0192_0F893FD433203608">
God, as the Right of private Judgment.</HI> p. 144. But indeed I do believe, that God has given to States the Right in Que&s;tion, <HI>as clearly and indu|bitably,</HI> as he has given to Men the Right of private Judgment. But be this as it may; the Doctor's Argument will conclude as &s;trongly again&s;t the Right of private Judgment, as again&s;t the Right of States to make E&s;tabli&s;hments. For if the ill Con&s;equences ari&s;ing from the Abu&s;e of a Thing, invalidate the Right to make a proper U&s;e of it, then &s;uch ill Con&s;equences may de&s;troy all Rights whatever. E&s;tabli&s;hments, without a Toleration of Di&s;&s;enters, are intirely out of the Que&s;tion: I never contended for &s;uch E&s;tabli&s;hments, nor do I think that States have a Right to make them. But that they are authori&s;ed to make E&s;tabli&s;hments, that do not violate the private Rights of Con&s;cience, is as clear to me, as any Propo&s;ition relating to civil Society. For it means no more than this, that the Magi&s;trate has a Right to give &s;ome pecu|liar Countenance and Encouragement, to what he e&s;|teems to be the true Religion; or, in other Words, that a Chri&s;tian Magi&s;trate has a Right to &s;hew more Favour to the Chri&s;tian Religion, than to Mahometi&s;m or Heatheni&s;m. And I will venture to add, that he has a Right to &s;hew <HI>as much</HI> Favour to his Religion, as is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport it, and is con&s;i&s;tent with a full and free Toleration.</P>
<P>AND if only &s;uch a Right had been claimed, and exerci&s;ed properly, in China, Turkey, or in any, or all the Kingdoms of the Earth; there would have been but little Rea&s;on to complain of any ill Con&s;equences. It is better that almo&s;t any Reli|gion &s;hould be &s;upported, than that there &s;hould be no Religion in a Nation; and &s;uch a Support
<PB N="186" REF="012007_0193_0F893FD4EF18F9F0">
as is contended for, would &s;till leave to tho&s;e of righter Judgment than the Magi&s;trate, the Liberty of acting according to it. The Doctor &s;peaks of CHRIST's not having <HI>intru&s;ted the State</HI> with a Right to make E&s;tabli&s;hments; not adverting to the Im|propriety of &s;uch Language. It was never pre|tended that this Right was given by Chri&s;t. The Authority he exerci&s;ed was altogether of a &s;piritual Nature. He never interfered with the Rights of States, either to abridge or enlarge them; and the Rights of Kingdoms and States, before the Go&s;pel, were exactly the &s;ame that they now are, under the Go&s;pel. He gave not the Right of private Judg|ment, for he found Men already in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. He only directed them in the U&s;e of it; and their being liable to err in the Exerci&s;e of it, is no Argument again&s;t the Exi&s;tence of the Right. In like Manner, the Fallibility of the State, and its being liable, in Con&s;equence of Mi&s;takes, to make wrong E&s;tabli&s;hments, proves not that it has no ju&s;t Authority to make right ones.</P>
<P>OBJECTION V. <HI>The Church of England in the Colonies, in its comparative low State, in&s;tead of an Epi&s;copate upon this or any other Plan, needs rather the charitable A&s;&s;i&s;tance of its Friends to &s;upport its pre&s;ent Mini&s;ters, and others that are &s;till wanted,</HI> p. 145.

with Regard to them, the Objection is not only weak, but utterly impertinent.</P>
<P>THE Doctor replies, that he had no Reference to the &s;outhern Colonies, <HI>for this very good Rea&s;on, becau&s;e it did not appear, that the Church of England in any of the&s;e Colonies had complained for Want of Bi&s;hops, or were di&s;po&s;ed to petition for them,</HI> p. 146. But the Petitions from hence, were in Behalf of the Church in tho&s;e Colonies, as well as in the&s;e; and although we were not authori&s;ed by the &s;outhern Co|lonies to petition in their Names, nor did we pre|tend to &s;uch a Commi&s;&s;ion, yet we had a Right to mention them, on the Occa&s;ion, as equally &s;uffer|ing for Want of an Epi&s;copate. The <HI>Appeal</HI> was made, 'in Behalf of the Church of England,' not only in the northern Colonies, but 'in America;' and this Objector had no Right to con&s;ider the propo&s;ed Epi&s;copate in a partial View, when the De&s;ign of it, and the Want of it, were known to be general, extending to all the Colonies within the Briti&s;h American Dominions.</P>
<P>IF the Clergy in &s;ome of the Colonies had not yet petitioned for an Epi&s;copate, yet as the Cir|cum&s;tances of tho&s;e Colonies equally required it, it was proper to include them in the Repre&s;entation, that was intended to &s;hew the general Want of an Epi&s;copate. I hope Men may &s;ometimes be con|&s;idered as needing A&s;&s;i&s;tance, e&s;pecially of a reli|gious Kind, before they formally reque&s;t it. But &s;ince the Doctor looks upon the actual petitioning of the Clergy in <HI>all</HI> the Colonies, as of &s;o much Con&s;equence to the Cau&s;e of a general Epi&s;copate; I can now give him the Plea&s;ure of hearing, that the Clergy in Maryland have, &s;ome Time &s;ince,
<PB N="188" REF="012007_0195_0F893FD67042E390">
generally united in petitioning the King, the Bi|&s;hops, &amp;c. in Favour of the Epi&s;copate propo&s;ed; and that their Petitions have expre&s;&s;ed as much Earne&s;tne&s;s in the Cau&s;e, as tho&s;e of our northern Conventions. And in a &s;hort Time, I doubt not but I &s;hall be able to give him the farther Plea&s;ure of hearing, that the Clergy of the few remaining Colonies have petitioned to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e. I tru&s;t he will take due Notice of this, and &s;hape his future Objections accordingly.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erved to him al&s;o, in An&s;wer to the Ob|jection, that
<Q>&s;uppo&s;ing the Church throughout the Colonies needed the charitable A&s;&s;i&s;tance of its Friends to &s;upport its Mini&s;ters, yet this would be no Proof that it does not need al&s;o an Epi&s;copate.</Q>
His Reply is, that notwith&s;tanding, <HI>it would fully prove, that the epi&s;copal Clergy, in the Colonies, are boundle&s;s in their De&s;ires of Charity.</HI> And he &s;eems to be well &s;atisfied, that, although his Argument fails of proving what it was alledged for, yet it will luckily prove &s;omething el&s;e. I would not rob him of any well-grounded Sati&s;|faction; but I mu&s;t take the Liberty to ob&s;erve, that what has been &s;aid by him does not yet prove, that the De&s;ires of the Clergy are more boundle&s;s than the Nece&s;&s;ities of the Church.</P>
<P>THE Doctor had urged that the Money, by which an Epi&s;copate mu&s;t be &s;upported, might be much more u&s;efully expended in &s;upporting Mi&s;|&s;ionaries in <HI>Carolina</HI> (I &s;uppo&s;e he meant North-Carolina) where <HI>the religious State of Things, by all Accounts, is deplorably &s;ad.</HI> In An&s;wer to this, I thought proper to ob&s;erve as follows:
<Q>When other Ends are to be an&s;wered (alluding to an
<PB N="189" REF="012007_0196_0F893FD72F397A40">
Expre&s;&s;ion of his own) the Writers again&s;t the Church can tell us, that the Society have no Power to apply their Funds to other U&s;es, than were intended by the Donors.&mdash;But <HI>now an Epi&s;|copate is in View,</HI> it is thought rea&s;onable and ju&s;t that the Society &s;hould alienate a Fund, more &s;trictly appropriated to a particular U&s;e than any other in their Power (for this may be truly &s;aid of the Fund for the Support of American Bi|&s;hops) and expend it upon Mi&s;&s;ionaries to be &s;ent to Carolina, and other Places, provided always, that &s;uch Places be at a due Di&s;tance from New-England<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Appeal defended,</HI> p. 215.</NOTE>.</Q>
The Doctor calls this a <HI>&s;trange Remark</HI>; and he affirms, that <HI>not a Word was &s;aid of the Fund appropriated for the Support of American Bi&s;hops, or of the Society's expending one Farthing of this Fund to</HI> [for] <HI>other U&s;es than were intended by the Donors,</HI> p. 147. But how can that Money, which is de&s;igned for the Support of Bi|&s;hops, be expended in maintaining Mi&s;&s;ionaries, without taking it from the appropriated epi&s;copal Fund, in which alone is depo&s;ited all that is known to have been thus intended? This would be, to apply to one U&s;e, what was particularly given for another. The epi&s;copal Fund con&s;i&s;ts of Legacies, and the Monies ari&s;ing from them by Intere&s;t, given for the &s;ole Purpo&s;e of maintaining American Bi&s;hops; and the Tru&s;tees of the&s;e Legacies, I humbly conceive, have no Right to apply them to any other U&s;e, than that for which they were intended, and to which they were limited, by the &s;everal Te&s;tators.</P>
<P>BUT the Doctor, who can be&s;t explain his own Meaning, now pleads, that he was apprehen&s;ive
<PB N="190" REF="012007_0197_0F893FD7EF796970">
the Society might take from the common Fund, to make up any Deficiency in the epi&s;copal Fund; and by that Means, the Support of an Epi&s;copate would le&s;&s;en the Number of Mi&s;&s;ionaries, which the Rea|der knows, he always wi&s;hes &s;hould be encrea&s;ed. If <HI>this, and this only, is what he had in View,</HI> I mi&s;took his Meaning; and the An&s;wer I gave was founded on a Mi&s;take. But upon reviewing the Pa&s;&s;age in his former Pamphlet, I find that the Mi&s;take was not my Fault but his; as I am &s;till un|able to make any other Inference from his Expre&s;|&s;ions, as they there &s;tand.</P>
<P>AND here he thinks proper to a&s;k my <HI>Opinion,</HI> whether the Society might not con&s;i&s;tently <HI>with Fidelity to their Tru&s;t,</HI> make U&s;e of &s;uch a Liberty, and apply Part of their common Fund to the Sup|port of an Epi&s;copate. It is not my Province to pre&s;cribe to that wi&s;e and venerable Body; but if I may expre&s;s my Opinion, it is clearly this&mdash;that, as they are known to have a Fund that is appro|priated to the Purpo&s;e of an American Epi&s;copate, whatever is not particularly given to that Fund, is not intended for that U&s;e, and the Society have <HI>no Right</HI> to employ it in that Service. I can al&s;o declare, that I have &s;ufficient Rea&s;on to believe, that no Members of the Society have ever intended or propo&s;ed, that Money &s;hould be taken from their common Fund for the Support of an Epi&s;copate in the Colonies.</P>
<P>THE Doctor &s;ays, that if I had <HI>looked within,</HI> he can <HI>&s;carce think</HI> that my <HI>Con&s;cience would have &s;uf|fered</HI> me to <HI>in&s;inuate,</HI> that he <HI>&s;pake of Mi&s;&s;ions in Carolina, becau&s;e at</HI>
<Q>a due Di&s;tance from New-England.</Q>
p. 148. I confe&s;s it was not by look|ing
<PB N="191" REF="012007_0198_0F893FD8AECA39C8">
<HI>within,</HI> but <HI>without,</HI> that I was led to &s;u&s;pect, that he was fonder of Mi&s;&s;ionaries at the Di&s;tance of Carolina, than in his own Neighbourhood. If he will declare to the contrary, I will acknowledge that I have been mi&s;taken. It has often &s;truck me, in reading the various Productions of the anti-epi&s;copal Writers in New-England, from the Let|ter of the <HI>Hamp&s;hire Mini&s;ters</HI> to the Bi&s;hop of London in 1734, with Dr. Coleman's Letter that accompanied it, down to Dr. Chauncy's la&s;t Pub|lication <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By Doctor Chauncy<HI>'s la&s;t</HI> Publication is here meant, his <HI>Reply</HI> to the <HI>Appeal defended,</HI> and not his REVENGE SERMON, preached May 30th, 1770; which &s;pared the Mi&s;&s;ionaries, as it had a more important Object in View. The apparent De|&s;ign of it was farther to <HI>inflame</HI> the Minds, of an inflamed Populace AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT.</NOTE>, that they were all very unea&s;y at the Neighbourhood of the Mi&s;&s;ionaries, and very in|genious at contriving Employment for them at a Di&s;tance. They &s;peak of the epi&s;copal Clergy as their Enemies; and it is natural for every Man to choo&s;e that his Enemies &s;hould be
<Q>at a due Di&s;|tance,</Q>
rather than within Reach of his Per&s;on. I think therefore, upon the whole, that it was no unnatural Conclu&s;ion, that tho&s;e Writers (not ex|cluding Dr. Chauncy) were de&s;irous that the Mi&s;&s;i|onaries &s;hould be employed as far from New-En|gland as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P><HI>IT is the real Truth of Fact,</HI> &s;ays the Doctor, <HI>to whatever Cau&s;e it may be owing, that they</HI> (the Society) <HI>have employed few Mi&s;&s;ionaries, next to none, in</HI> [North] <HI>Carolina, where they were mo&s;t needed, and multiplied them where there was little, if any Need at all of them; and in &s;ome Places they have &s;upported, and are &s;till &s;upporting them, where the Churches to whom</HI> [which] <HI>they mini&s;ter, are
<PB N="192" REF="012007_0199_0F894128AD4A7F68">
abundantly able, without any A&s;&s;i&s;tance from them, to &s;upport the Go&s;pel.</HI> p 149. As to North-Caro|lina, it is confe&s;&s;ed that there never have been &s;o many Clergymen there as were needed; but it does not appear that this was owing to any Inat|tention or Neglect of the Society. The Society's Fund is not an inexhau&s;tible Trea&s;ure, enabling them to &s;upply the Wants of all People in the Colonies. As they have never been able to gratify all the Petitioners for their Favour, it has been their Study to give the Preference where it was due. Tho&s;e Congregations which di&s;cover the greate&s;t Willingne&s;s to exert them&s;elves towards the Support of their Mini&s;ters, the greate&s;t De&s;ire to obtain the Society's Favour, and the be&s;t Di&s;po|&s;ition to improve by it, provided they appear at the &s;ame Time to be unable to rai&s;e a &s;ufficient Support them&s;elves, mu&s;t naturally be thought by the Society to be the propere&s;t Objects of their Charity. A Fund that is in&s;ufficient to an&s;wer all Nece&s;&s;ities for which it is wanted, mu&s;t be careful|ly hu&s;banded, that it may go as far as po&s;&s;ible. Now it is evident that the Society may do all that is needful to &s;upport Two Mi&s;&s;ions, where the Peo|ple will be equal Contributors with them, at the &s;ame Expence that would be nece&s;&s;ary for the Sup|port of one Mi&s;&s;ion, where the People are unable, or unwilling, to contribute; to &s;ay nothing of the greater Pro&s;pect of Succe&s;s, in a Mi&s;&s;ion of one Sort than of the other. This accounts for the Multiplication of Mi&s;&s;ions in the Northern Colo|nies, beyond the Proportion that has obtained in North-Carolina; where the People made no Of|fers, and u&s;ed no Importunities, that could &s;tand in Competition with tho&s;e that went home from the&s;e Colonies. To this may be added, that pro|per
<PB N="193" REF="012007_0200_0F8941296EBBD630">
Per&s;ons could &s;eldom be found, that were wil|ling to enter upon Mi&s;&s;ions in North-Carolina. The Climate and the Circum&s;tances of that Colo|ny, are generally e&s;teemed by <HI>Strangers</HI> to be di&s;|agreeable; and for Want of an Opportunity for an academical Education, but few of the <HI>Natives</HI> have offered them&s;elves as Candidates for holy Or|ders. Yet notwith&s;tanding the&s;e Di&s;advantages, the Society have, for more than 30 Years pa&s;t, found out Methods of &s;ending &s;ome Mi&s;&s;ionaries thither; and it appears by the la&s;t <HI>Ab&s;tract,</HI> that they have now no le&s;s than <HI>Twelve</HI> Mi&s;&s;ionaries employ|ed in that Colony. And while Strangers may won|der that they have done &s;o little, tho&s;e that are acquainted with their Hi&s;tory and Circum&s;tances, wonder that they have been able to do &s;o much, as in Reality they have done, in North-Carolina.</P>
<P>BUT the Mi&s;repre&s;entation goes &s;till farther. It makes the Society to have <HI>multiplied</HI> Mi&s;&s;ionaries, <HI>where there was little if any Need at all of them</HI>; while they have neglected tho&s;e Places where they were mo&s;t needed. The Doctor undoubtedly thinks that there can be but <HI>little, if any Need at all</HI> of Mi&s;&s;ionaries, in tho&s;e Places where there are Preachers of the pre&s;byterian or congregational Cla&s;s: But it is happy for the Members of the Church of England in the&s;e Colonies, that the So|ciety govern them&s;elves by their own Opinion, and not by his. However, in one Sen&s;e at lea&s;t, what he &s;ays but two Pages afterwards, is a full Ju&s;tifi|cation of the Society's Conduct, with Regard to New-England. For he a&s;&s;erts that the Mi&s;&s;ions there, <HI>are, by far the greater Part of them, in &s;o weak and low a State, that there would be no Hope of their continued Exi&s;tence, if that Charity was
<PB N="194" REF="012007_0201_0F89412A2CB1A298">
withdrawn, which, at fir&s;t, gave Being to them, and has all along &s;upported them in Being.</HI> p. 131. The Society, it is hoped, will make a proper U&s;e of this Information, which corre&s;ponds with the Accounts from the Mi&s;&s;ionaries: And it is not doubted but their Affection for the Churches to which they have <HI>given Being,</HI> and which are known &s;till to depend upon them for the nece&s;&s;ary Support of it, will &s;trongly plead in Favour of them, and prevent their being de&s;erted, in this dependent, feeble State. In Time the&s;e Churches may become able to &s;upport them&s;elves; and when this &s;hall be the Ca&s;e, they will cea&s;e to be proper Objects of the Society's Charity. Whenever the epi&s;copal Congregations in New-England &s;hall appear to have arrived to that State, we may judge what the Society will do, from what they have done, in a like Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>IN South-Carolina, the Society were early in e&s;|tabli&s;hing Mi&s;&s;ions. About 30 Years ago they had ten Mi&s;&s;ions in this Colony, &s;upported at the annu|al Expence of &pound;. 450 Sterling. But as the Church there has become able
<Q>to &s;tand upon its own Legs, and without foreign Help to &s;upport it|&s;elf <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">See the <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> of <HI>Landaff</HI>'s SERMON.</NOTE>;</Q>
the Bounty of the Society has been withdrawn, and at pre&s;ent they have but one Mi&s;&s;ionary in the whole Colony, and he is employ|ed altogether among the poor <HI>Palatines.</HI> Let the Reader con&s;ider this Ca&s;e which is directly in point, and attend to what has been &s;aid of the Society's Conduct relating to the adjoining Colony of North-Carolina, together with what will be &s;oon &s;aid of Nova-Scotia; and he will be able to form a &s;ati&s;|factory Judgment&mdash;whether they are di&s;po&s;ed, or
<PB N="195" REF="012007_0202_0F89412AECD26550">
not, to multiply Mi&s;&s;ions where there is but <HI>little Need</HI> of them, and to neglect tho&s;e Places which have <HI>mo&s;t Need</HI> of them, as Dr. Chauncy very de|cently charges them.</P>
<P>HE cen&s;ures them for &s;upporting Mini&s;ters in Places, where the Congregations are able to &s;up|port them, without any A&s;&s;i&s;tance. But according to his own Account, there can be but very few &s;uch Places in New-England. And it has never been fairly proved that the Society have done this, in a &s;ingle In&s;tance. I know that &s;everal &s;uch In&s;tances have been pointed out by the Enemies of the Church; but the Congregations them&s;elves, which ought to be the be&s;t Judges of their own Abilities, declare the Ca&s;e to have been otherwi&s;e, and the Friends of the Church believe their Declarations to be true. Whether it be &s;o or not, the Society mu&s;t judge according to the Evidence they receive; and it can hardly be expected, that the Te&s;timony of their Enemies, in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, will weigh more with them, than the Te&s;timony of their Friends, agreeing with the Declarations of the Congregati|ons more immediately concerned.</P>
<P>HE al&s;o accu&s;es the Society of having <HI>&s;trangely neglected Canada</HI>; and for Proof of it, refers to a Pa&s;&s;age which clearly proves, that they have made that Colony the Object of their Attention. What he refers to, is an Ab&s;tract of a Letter from Mr. Deli&s;le, Chaplain to the Garri&s;on at Montreal, dated Sept. 30, 1767. If the Society had been under no Concern for the religious State of Canada, they never would have publi&s;hed to the World the Con|tents of &s;uch a Letter. It is probable that the Letter was &s;ent to them, in Con&s;equence of their
<PB N="196" REF="012007_0203_0F89412CEE5D1848">
Inquiry; as it contains partly a <HI>Notitia parochialis,</HI> &s;uch as the Society require from their Mi&s;&s;ionaries. I know that they had the Subject under Con&s;ider|ation, before the Time that the Letter was dated. Although the Doctor &s;peaks of me, as a Per&s;on not having that <HI>Chri&s;tian Concern for the Propa|gation of the Go&s;pel, which might have been expected from a Mi&s;&s;ionary</HI>; yet &s;o early as in 1766, I joined with my worthy Brethren in CONVENTION, in re|pre&s;enting the religious State of Canada to the Society, and in recommending it to their Attention. This was no great while after the Ce&s;&s;ion of that Colony, by Treaty, to the Briti&s;h Crown.</P>
<P>AT that Time, although &s;omething was proper to be done in Favour of the prote&s;tant Religion in Canada; yet the Circum&s;tances of the Country did not require, nor would they with any Propriety admit of, &s;o much to be done, as many People are apt to imagine. There were then but few Prote&s;|tants in the Colony, that were Natives of it; and but few Engli&s;h People, except the Military; and tho&s;e few &s;eated chiefly in Quebec and Montreal, where divine Service was regularly performed by the Chaplains of the Garri&s;ons. If therefore Mi&s;|&s;ionaries at that time had been &s;ent to other Places, it mu&s;t have been in Order to pro&s;elyte the Cana|dians who were Papi&s;ts, and Strangers to the Eng|li&s;h Language. But the Papi&s;ts would have been alarmed at &s;uch an Attempt, when it was peculiarly nece&s;&s;ary to quiet and compo&s;e their Spirits; and they would have con&s;trued it to be a Violation of the Treaty of Surrender, which provided that they might continue to enjoy their Religion, without Mole&s;tation. It would therefore have been a very hopeful Project in the Society, to <HI>multiply</HI> Mi&s;&s;ions
<PB N="197" REF="012007_0204_0F89412D2CAD31E0">
in &s;uch a Country, at &s;uch a Time, and under &s;uch Circum&s;tances. E&s;pecially if it be con&s;idered, that in Order to &s;end Mi&s;&s;ionaries to Canada, as the Society's whole Fund was already engaged, and no new Re&s;ources appeared, they mu&s;t have broken through their former Engagements, and have re|moved their Mi&s;&s;ionaries from other Places, where they were thought to be u&s;efully employed; or have di&s;charged &s;ome of them, that they might be able to &s;upport others in Canada&mdash;where there could be but little Pro&s;pect of their U&s;efulne&s;s, and where there was much Danger of their increa&s;ing that Di&s;content, which required all the Skill of Go|vernment to keep within Bounds.</P>
<P>BESIDES: Had the Society been ever &s;o able, and the Pro&s;pect of Succe&s;s much greater than it was; it would not have been proper for them to croud Mi&s;&s;ionaries into Canada, as &s;oon as its Sub|jection to the Briti&s;h Crown was confirmed. It would have been <HI>decent</HI> at lea&s;t, to wait &s;ome Time, to &s;ee whether the Government, upon &s;ettling the <HI>Police</HI> of that new Colony, would not make &s;ome &s;uitable Provi&s;ion for the Encouragement and Sup|port of the prote&s;tant Religion in that Di&s;trict, &s;o far as it &s;hould appear to be expedient and proper. Until the final Re&s;olutions of Government were taken, and it was known that no Provi&s;ion of this Kind was to be expected from thence, there are many Per&s;ons that would have charged the Society with intermeddling in Matters out of their Province, and not treating their Superiors with proper Re&s;|pect, had they a&s;&s;umed the Management of the religious Affairs of Canada into their own Hands. On &s;imilar Occa&s;ions, where there have been new Acqui&s;itions of Territory, the Society was actually
<PB N="198" REF="012007_0205_0F89412DECC15620">
told, that it was irregular and improper for them to act, until the De&s;igns of Government were known. I &s;ay not this at random, but upon the be&s;t Authority.</P>
<P>SINCE the Society have thought the proper Time was come, for them to interpo&s;e in Behalf of Ca|nada, they have not been inactive. Government has been &s;ollicited to &s;end prote&s;tant Clergymen into that Country; in Con&s;equence of which, <HI>three</HI> are actually appointed, one for Quebec, one for Montreal, and a third (I think) for Trois-Riveirs&mdash; which are the only Places at pre&s;ent, in which much Advantage can be expected from Prote&s;tant Cler|gymen. The Society have al&s;o &s;ollicited for School-Ma&s;ters; and have already &s;ent con&s;ider|able Packets of Books, at their own Expence, into different Parts of the Province. As Opportunity and Ability will admit of, more will be done; and indeed every Thing that is practicable in Favour of the prote&s;tant Religion may be expected, from the Vigilance and Activity of that charitable and vene|rable Body.</P>
<P>WE may fairly judge of their Di&s;po&s;ition towards Canada, from the Care they have taken of Nova-Scotia. Not many Years ago, the religious State of that Colony was nearly the &s;ame, with what the religious State of Canada now is. And it appears from the <HI>Ab&s;tracts,</HI> that the Society, although their Progre&s;s at fir&s;t fell &s;hort of their own Wi&s;hes, as well as of &s;ome People's Expectations, have in their Employment in Nova-Scotia no le&s;s than thirteen Mi&s;&s;ionaries and School-Ma&s;ters, at the yearly Expence of &pound;. 495 Sterling, to &s;ay nothing of the large Sums annually expended in Books,
<PB N="199" REF="012007_0206_0F89412EB2AB7B38">
&amp;c. By this Time I hope the Doctor begins to be a&s;hamed of the unrighteous Abu&s;e, with which he has treated a Society, that de&s;erves to be honoured, applauded and admired by the whole Chri&s;tian World.</P>
<P>DR. Chauncy often &s;peaks of the Church of England in the Northern Colonies as incon&s;iderable, not worthy of Notice, and in a State little better than Non-exi&s;tence. And yet if we were to judge from the mighty Efforts that have been made to &s;top its Progre&s;s, and the Alarms it has occa&s;ioned to the Bigots, we &s;hould imagine that it had, not only the Rage, but the <HI>Strength,</HI> of a Lion, and threatened the &s;peedy De&s;truction of every other Religion in the Country. In his former Pamphlet he &s;aid, that <HI>it has grown but little in Compari&s;on with the other Denominations</HI> in New-England. This I di&s;puted, and this he thinks proper &s;till to maintain. But among <HI>the other Denominations,</HI> that have thus increa&s;ed in New-England, e&s;pecially in the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, he mu&s;t not reckon his own, the <HI>Congregationali&s;t.</HI> For Time was, when they not only claimed, but actually kept Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that whole Dominion, to them&s;elves; and as other Denominations &s;ince have obtained Footing, the <HI>Congregationali&s;ts</HI> mu&s;t have <HI>proportionably</HI> lo&s;t Ground.</P>
<P>AND here again I am obliged to <HI>uncover the Na|kedne&s;s of my Ance&s;tors,</HI> for which the Doctor is an&s;werable. In Order to maintain their exclu&s;ive Right to the Country, the Congregationali&s;ts tran&s;|ported, as Criminals, &s;uch as were found to retain an Affection for the Church; and the Quakers, that had the Luck to e&s;cape hanging, were bani&s;hed

I need &s;ay nothing of the latter, as their Hi&s;tory is well known: But I beg Leave to lay before the Reader, a Pa&s;&s;age relating to the former, extracted from a valuable Book <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>New-England's Memorial,</HI> by <HI>Mr. Morton</HI>; who &s;tyles him&s;elf "Secretary to the Court for the Juri&s;diction of <HI>New-"Plimouth.</HI>"</NOTE> which is now &s;carce, in which there appears to be no Partiality in Favor of the Church.
<Q>Some of the Pa&s;&s;engers, &s;ays he, that came over at the &s;ame Time (1629), ob&s;erving that the Mini&s;ters did not at all u&s;e the Book of Common Prayer, and that they did admini&s;ter Bapti&s;m and the Lord's Supper without the Ceremonies, and that they profe&s;&s;ed al&s;o to u&s;e Di&s;cipline in the Congrega|tion again&s;t &s;candalous Per&s;ons, &amp;c. they began to rai&s;e &s;ome Trouble: Of the&s;e Mr. Samuel Brown and his Brother were the Chief, the one being a Lawyer, the other a Merchant, both of them among&s;t the Number of the fir&s;t Paten|tees, Men of E&s;tates, and Men of Parts and Port in the Place. The&s;e two Brothers gather|ed a Company together in a Place di&s;tinct from the public A&s;&s;embly, and there &s;undry Times the Book of Common-Prayer was read unto &s;uch as re&s;orted thither. The Governor Mr. Endicot taking Notice of the Di&s;turbance that began to grow among&s;t the People by this Means, he convented the two Brothers before him. They accu&s;ed the Mini&s;ters as departing from the Or|ders of the Church of England, that they were Separati&s;ts, &amp;c. but for them&s;elves, they would hold to the Orders of the Church of England. &mdash;The Governor and Council&mdash;finding the&s;e two Brothers to be of high Spirits, and their Speeches

and Practices tending to Mutiny and Faction, the Governor told them that <HI>New-England was no Place for &s;uch as they</HI>; and <HI>therefore,</HI> he &s;ent them both back to England at the Return of the Ships the &s;ame Year <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See the above-mentioned Book. p. 104.</NOTE>.</Q>
We &s;ee the Crime of the&s;e Men, and we &s;ee their Puni&s;hment. Their <HI>Speeches,</HI> becau&s;e they were in Favor of the Church of England, and their <HI>Practices,</HI> becau&s;e they made U&s;e of the Liturgy, were interpreted as tending to <HI>Mutiny</HI> and <HI>Faction.</HI> It was &s;olemn|ly decreed, that <HI>New-England was no Place</HI> for &s;uch People, <HI>i. e.</HI> for Churchmen; and then, nei|ther their Right as original Patentees, nor their Abilities, nor Wealth, could &s;creen them from the Puni&s;hment of Tran&s;portation.</P>
<P>BY the&s;e Methods, the Congregationali&s;ts kept the Country intirely to them&s;elves, for a con&s;ider|able while; and had not a general Toleration been introduced by the Authority of Government at home, it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay, how long it would have been, before any other Denominations of Chri&s;ti|ans had been &s;uffered to live among them. There may be &s;till &s;ome few of their De&s;cendants, that have inherited the &s;ame Sentiments and the &s;ame Spirit; but, in general, the Times are now great|ly altered for the better, in this Re&s;pect. Men of different Per&s;ua&s;ions can live together in the &s;ame Neighbourhood, and maintain a friendly Inter|cour&s;e with one another, in a Country where none but Congregationali&s;ts were &s;uffered to exi&s;t; and were it not for &s;ome hot-headed Leaders of the People, and &s;ome &s;cribbling Incendiaries (I have no particular Reference to the Doctor) the Peace and Harmony of Society would not be di&s;turbed by
<PB N="202" REF="012007_0209_0F894130EE3934C8">
Difference of Principle. Epi&s;copalians, Bapti&s;ts, Quakers and others, have ventured to come into the Colony; many of the Congregationali&s;ts have adopted their Principles; and the re&s;t commonly entertain more favorable Sentiments of tho&s;e they differ from, than they received from their Ance&s;|tors. Although they have a Veneration for their Fore-Fathers, yet they are not &s;o blind as to be unable to di&s;tingui&s;h the Defects in their Charac|ter; which Defects they think them&s;elves under no Obligations to vindicate. This candid Temper has been, as &s;uch a Temper always will be, favor|able to the Church; and there are, at this Time, not le&s;s than 20 Churches actually built, and a &s;till larger Number of epi&s;copal Congregations, in this <HI>anti-epi&s;copal</HI> Province.</P>
<P>AS to Connecticut, the Doctor allows the Church to have increa&s;ed there, beyond the Proportion of other Denominations; but he affects to be of Opi|nion, that what I &s;aid upon the Subject was <HI>hyper|bolical,</HI> and beyond the Bounds of literal Truth. My Words were the&s;e:
<Q>I cannot, at pre&s;ent, re|collect an Example, in any Age or Country, wherein &s;o great a Proportion of Pro&s;elytes has been made to any Religion in &s;o &s;hort a Time, as has been made to the Church of England in the We&s;tern Divi&s;ion of that populous Colony; unle&s;s where the Power of Miracles, or the Arm of the Magi&s;trate, was exerted to produce that Effect <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Appeal defended. p. 217.</NOTE>.</Q>
This was literally true at that Time; and as I could then recollect no &s;uch Example, &s;o none has occured to me &s;ince. If the Doctor knows of any, let it be pointed out.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="012007_0210_0F894131AD2C3968">HE was plea&s;ed to repre&s;ent the Church of En|gland in the Colonies as being in her <HI>Infancy,</HI> and &s;o far from a <HI>State of Maturity, as to make it not worth while for a Bi&s;hop to come here.</HI> And it was an&s;wered:
<Q>Infant and feeble as She is, he has allowed that She may be 270,000 &s;trong in the Colonies, exclu&s;ively of the I&s;lands, after reducing her Numbers as low as po&s;&s;ible. Now can he po&s;&s;ibly think, when he gives him&s;elf Time for Con&s;ideration, that the Church of England in America, containing 270,000 Members, (be&s;ides many Thou&s;ands more in the I&s;lands) in which are included mo&s;t of the Governors and princi|pal Per&s;ons in the Colonies, is &s;o incon&s;iderable, that it is <HI>not worth while</HI> for a Bi&s;hop to take Charge of it?

<P>HE replies, that when he &s;pake in this Manner, he had Reference only <HI>to her Exi&s;tence in the Seven Colonies, extending from Penn&s;ylvania</HI> to the North|ward. p. 152. I have again examined the Pa&s;&s;age as it &s;tands in his Pamphlet, and I &s;ee nothing that &s;hews that he confined his View within this limited Compa&s;s. Be&s;ides, he had no Right to an&s;wer a general Repre&s;entation of the Church in <HI>all</HI> the Colonies, by a partial Account of it as exi&s;ting only in <HI>&s;ome</HI> of the Colonies. He might as pro|perly have confined his View to the Province of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, or to the Town of Bo&s;ton only. The Plea for an Epi&s;copate was made in Behalf, <HI>at lea&s;t,</HI> of 270,000 People in the Colonies, be|&s;ides
<PB N="204" REF="012007_0211_0F89413271C31AF0">
many Thou&s;ands in the I&s;lands; and to &s;hew the Invalidity of it, he urges that it is not nece&s;&s;a|ry on Account of 26 or 27 Thou&s;ands of that Number, according to the Calculations of his own Arithmetic&mdash;throwing more than nine Tenths of the whole intirely out of the Que&s;tion. This he may call <HI>rea&s;oning,</HI> but there is a more proper Name by which others will call it.</P>
<P>HE acknowledges that <HI>the Governor, in mo&s;t of the&s;e Colonies, is commonly in Name an Epi&s;copalian</HI>; but he re&s;pectfully &s;ays, that they are <HI>&s;ometimes de&s;titute of every Thing that looks like Religion.</HI> p. 153. Some Men can &s;eize upon the &s;lighte&s;t Oc|ca&s;ions, to "&s;peak evil of Dignities." I do not believe there is at this Time a Governor on the Continent, who pretends to be an Epi&s;copalian, that has given any ju&s;t Ground for this Reflection. Their Characters in general are irreproachable. Some of them are as eminent for their Virtues, as their Stations; the Examples, as well as Patrons, of whatever is amiable and excellent in private Life; the Ornaments, as well as Friends and Pro|tectors of Religion, But were it otherwi&s;e, their Rank renders them important, and gives a Weight to that religious Society, of which they profe&s;s them&s;elves Members.</P>
<P>THE Doctor proceeds, in IAMBICS: <HI>It is quite remote from Truth to &s;ay, that mo&s;t of the principal Per&s;ons in the Colonies, are of this Per&s;ua&s;ion, unle&s;s by principal Per&s;ons are meant, tho&s;e who are ap|pointed to their civil Po&s;ts from home.</HI> What was &s;aid is mo&s;t unque&s;tionably true of the Colonies to the Southward of New-England, and probably true of the Colonies in general, <HI>exclu&s;ively</HI> of tho&s;e
<PB N="205" REF="012007_0212_0F8941332D176178">
Per&s;ons that are appointed to <HI>civil Po&s;ts</HI> under the Government. But why, in the Name of common Sen&s;e, &s;hould the&s;e be excluded? Does the Doctor imagine, that a civil Employment, held under the Government, <HI>degrades</HI> a Man from his former Rank and Character in Life? Such Ebullitions of an anti-monarchical Spirit ought, in Prudence, to have been &s;uppre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>HE continues: <HI>In general there are</HI> 50 <HI>principal Per&s;ons to one, in the non-epi&s;copal Colonies, who are not Members of the Church of England, but of Churches of other Denominations.</HI> By the non-epi&s;|copal Colonies he means here, I &s;uppo&s;e, as he explains him&s;elf el&s;ewhere, New-England, New-York, New-Jer&s;ey and Penn&s;ylvania. In the three la&s;t-mentioned Colonies, the Gentlemen of Fortune and Character belonging to the Church of England, are, I believe, as numerous, as tho&s;e of all other Denominations, excepting the Quakers in Penn|&s;ylvania. And as to New-England, there are as many Per&s;ons of Di&s;tinction belonging to the Church, (&s;ome &s;ay many more) in Proportion to the Number of Epi&s;copalians, as of any other Profe&s;&s;ion. But if we &s;uppo&s;e the Proportion to be but equal throughout the&s;e Northern Colonies in general; then, in Order to make the Number of principal Per&s;ons of other Per&s;ua&s;ions 50 Times greater than of tho&s;e belonging to the Church, tho&s;e different Denominations mu&s;t be 50 Times as numerous as the Members of the Church. Now the Doctor allows, that in the&s;e &s;even Colonies, there may be 27,000 Epi&s;copalians: Con&s;equently, according to his Repre&s;entation, there mu&s;t be, within the &s;ame Compa&s;s, 1,377,000 Inhabitants. But if the Number of Epi&s;copalians is much
<PB N="206" REF="012007_0213_0F894134D3DA8500">
larger, as it undoubtedly is, then the Inhabitants, from Penn&s;ylvania to the Northward, without in|cluding Canada and Nova-Scotia, can be but little le&s;s than 2,000,000. The notorious Fal&s;ehood of the <HI>Conclu&s;ion,</HI> argues a Defect in the Doctor's Premi&s;es.</P>
<P>IN an&s;wering the <HI>Appeal,</HI> Dr. Chauncy had introduced a long Extract from one of Dr. Mayhew's Pamphlets, to which Mr. Apthorp had given a direct and particular An&s;wer, whereof not the lea&s;t Notice was taken. This Conduct appeared to me to be extraordinary; and in &s;peaking of it I u&s;ed the following Words:
<Q>Was it treating his Readers generou&s;ly, or fairly, or hone&s;tly, to pre&s;ent them with Dr. Mayhew's Objections, broadly hinting, although not directly affirming, that they had not been an&s;wered; when he mu&s;t have known, that they had not only been an&s;wered, but that no Reply had been made to the An&s;wer?</Q>
He now &s;ays, that there was no Need of any Excu&s;e for &s;uch Conduct. <HI>In Compliance with the Invita|tion given in the Appeal, my Bu&s;ine&s;s was, not to an&s;wer Objections, but to bring them that they might be an&s;wered by the Doctor.</HI> There is &s;omething very curious in this Account of the Matter. He offered Objections that had been publickly refuted, without any Intimation that a Refutation had been attempted, becau&s;e it was not his Bu&s;ine&s;s <HI>to an&s;wer Objections.</HI> Would then his taking Notice that Mr. Apthorp had replied, have been <HI>an An&s;wer</HI> to Dr. Mayhew's Objections? If &s;o, although I never thought there would be much Difficulty in an&s;wer|ing them, the Work is more ea&s;y than I imagined. If it was not his Bu&s;ine&s;s to <HI>an&s;wer</HI> Objections; neither was it his proper Bu&s;ine&s;s to bring Objecti|ons,
<PB N="207" REF="012007_0214_0F8941357B205E28">
in that Manner, that had been an&s;wered. The Invitation in the <HI>Appeal,</HI> can be no Ju&s;tification of &s;uch Conduct, as it propo&s;ed only
<Q>a fair and can|did Debate.</Q>
An Objection that has been &s;hewn to be weak, is no better than a Fact that has been proved to be fal&s;e. If the Weakne&s;s of an Ob|jection has been only <HI>attempted</HI> to be &s;hewn; it is &s;till upon the &s;ame Footing with a Fact that has been contradicted: And it is not 'fair and candid,' in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, to offer the Objection as &s;ound, without clearing it of the Imputation of being defective; any more than to a&s;&s;ume the Truth of a Fact that is contradicted or denied, without clear|ing it of the Imputation of Fal&s;ehood. He thinks it was his Bu&s;ine&s;s to bring Objections to be an|&s;wered by me: But the bringing &s;uch Objections as he has often exhibited, looks more like an Amu&s;ement of Idlene&s;s, than the proper <HI>Bu&s;ine&s;s</HI> of any Man, e&s;pecially of the Doctor's Character and Station. The Truth, I believe, is, that he hoped Mr. Apthorp's <HI>Review</HI> had e&s;caped me, and that I was unable to an&s;wer tho&s;e Objections of Dr. Mayhew as effectually as Mr. Apthorp had done. Indeed he &s;eems to have a &s;trong De&s;ire, that nothing which that Gentleman had written, in Vindication of the Church, &s;hould be repeated or remembered. Such a careful and &s;tudied Neglect of Mr. Apthorp, is the greate&s;t Honour that the Enemies of the Church can pay him.</P>
<P>BEFORE the Doctor retired to make Room for Dr. Mayhew, he propo&s;ed an <HI>Expedient</HI> to com|promi&s;e Matters between the Epi&s;copalians and their Adver&s;aries. It was, that the King &s;hould grant a Commi&s;&s;ion to &s;ome of the Clergy here, to per|form the Office of a Bi&s;hop. I told him his
<PB N="208" REF="012007_0215_0F8941362CD76690">
Expedient wanted even Plau&s;ibility.
<Q>It can nei|ther an&s;wer the Ends of Epi&s;copalians, nor tho&s;e of the Projector and his Adherents. The Powers wanted by the American Church are <HI>purely of a &s;piritual Nature,</HI> which therefore the King cannot give: Such Authority as can be given by the King, is altogether <HI>temporal,</HI> which is the very Thing that the Di&s;&s;enters dread:&mdash;So that nei|ther Epi&s;copalians nor Di&s;&s;enters can po&s;&s;ibly acquie&s;ce in the Expedient<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Appeal defended,</HI> p. 220.</NOTE>.</Q>
In Reply to this, he only &s;ays, that if the Reader will examine what he &s;aid relating to the Subject, he will be convinced, <HI>that under pretence of &s;aying Something,</HI> I had <HI>really &s;aid nothing.</HI> To &s;o feeble a Reply, I &s;hall not <HI>pretend</HI> to &s;ay any Thing. Therefore</P>
<P>I SHALL pa&s;s on to con&s;ider the Rea&s;ons a&s;&s;igned, for Dr. Mayhew's not replying to Mr. Apthorp. <HI>Neither he</HI> (Dr. Mayhew) <HI>or</HI> [nor] <HI>his Friends thought it</HI> (Mr. Apthorp's <HI>Review) worthy of &s;uch Notice.</HI> This is but a poor Ju&s;tification of any Man, from a Charge that lies again&s;t him. Others think, per|haps as ju&s;tly, that he made no Reply, becau&s;e he was afraid of the Con&s;equence. He had Sen&s;e enough to know that it was Time to &s;top; I wi&s;h that &s;ome others may improve by his Example. Another Rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned for his not making a Reply is, that it was imagined that Mr. Apthorp, <HI>wrote principally with a View to recommend him&s;elf to a certain great Man, who&s;e Favour might be advan|tageous to him.</HI> Were there no other Motives then, that could induce Mr. Apthorp to review a Contro|ver&s;y that he him&s;elf had occa&s;ioned, and in which he had been &s;o often mentioned on both Sides, than to recommend him&s;elf to the Favour of a certain
<PB N="209" REF="012007_0216_0F894136F16BEAA0">
Superior? Or is there the lea&s;t Evidence that he was at all influenced by the Con&s;ideration, whereby it is in&s;inuated that he was <HI>principally</HI> governed? How ungenerous then, how low and illiberal is it, to a&s;cribe to a Gentleman of his Character &s;uch a mercenary Motive? If any one &s;hould charge Dr. Chauncy with having written Two huge Pamphlets again&s;t American Bi&s;hops, <HI>principally with a View to recommend him&s;elf to the Favour</HI> of &s;ome great Demagogue in the Town of Bo&s;ton, would he not think &s;uch a Reflection unworthy of a Gentleman? And yet, I believe, the Evidence of this, both internal and external, is as clear and authentic, as can be produced again&s;t Mr. Apthorp. But what|ever Object this latter Gentleman might have had more immediately in View, it is nothing to the Pur|po&s;e. His <HI>Review</HI> bore hard upon Dr. Mayhew's Performance; the Reputation of the latter, and of his Cau&s;e, was at Stake; and it concerned him to vindicate both him&s;elf and his Cau&s;e, as well as he could.</P>
<P>BUT this he neglected to do, and Dr. Chauncy attempts it. And as I have occa&s;ioned Mr. Apthorp to be brought into this Debate, in his Ab&s;ence; I e&s;teem it my Duty to repair, as well as I can, the Injuries he has &s;uffered on my Account.</P>
<P>THE <HI>An&s;werer</HI> to Dr. Mayhew'<HI>s Ob&s;ervations</HI> had explained the Plan, on which only it had been propo&s;ed to &s;end Bi&s;hops to America. Dr. May|hew allowed that the Propo&s;al was &s;et in a more unexceptionable Point of Light, than he had &s;een it in before; but he objected to the Information, as not coming from &s;ufficient Authority. Yet at the &s;ame Time he appeared to believe, what is now
<PB N="210" REF="012007_0217_0F894137ACCF0608">
univer&s;ally known, that his Informer was no le&s;s a Per&s;on than the late Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury. To &s;hew that the Plan there pre&s;ented to the Pub|lic, was no peculiar Scheme of the <HI>An&s;werer,</HI> Mr. Apthorp declared that the &s;ame Plan had been a|greed upon by many Per&s;ons of high Rank in the Church, and that all who appeared to have con|&s;idered it, heartily approved of it&mdash;the Evidence of which he was ready to produce. Among others, Bi&s;hop Butler had drawn up a Scheme for an A|merican Epi&s;copate, in 1750: this was publi&s;hed as a Specimen, and it exactly agreed with the Plan contained in the <HI>An&s;wer</HI>; and enough was &s;aid, in all Rea&s;on, to &s;ilence Dr. Mayhew's affected Su&s;pi|cions. Nor does Dr. Chauncy offer any Thing, that &s;hews the Impropriety of Mr. Apthorp's Repre|&s;entation.</P>
<P>INDEED he &s;ays of the&s;e Plans, that <HI>they are not to be looked on as Schemes &s;et forth on the Foot of proper Authority.</HI> p. 157. All the Authority want|ed, is &s;ufficient Evidence that &s;uch an Epi&s;|copate as was &s;pecified, and no other, had been propo&s;ed for the Colonies. But if by <HI>proper Au|thority</HI> he means that of the King and Parliament, what he &s;ays is true, but not to the Purpo&s;e. For the Que&s;tion was not, what Kind of an Epi&s;copate was intended, or whether any was intended, by the King and Parliament; but what Kind of an Epi&s;|copate had been propo&s;ed by tho&s;e that had taken the Subject into Con&s;ideration, and were de&s;irous that Bi&s;hops might be &s;ent to America. Now the Bi&s;hops at home, and many of the principal Friends of the Church, both there and here, had agreed upon a Plan of an Epi&s;copate for the Co|lonies, which was formed with a View of relieving
<PB N="211" REF="012007_0218_0F8941386E2FFD68">
the &s;piritual Nece&s;&s;ities of the Church, without affecting the Liberties of others, or interfering with the civil Government; upon which Plan it always appeared probable that an Epi&s;copate would be granted. That &s;ome Plan had been concerted, was commonly known; the Nature of the Plan, the <HI>An&s;werer</HI> explained; and his Explanation Mr. Apthorp confirmed, proving it to have been fair and ju&s;t. This is all that could be required or expected, as the Plan had not been pre&s;ented and recommended to the Government, and con&s;equent|ly could not be <HI>&s;et forth on the Foot of</HI> the <HI>Autho|rity</HI> of Government. If the only Plan that had been propo&s;ed was unexceptionable, Men ought to have been &s;atisfied; for nothing can be more ab&s;urd than to oppo&s;e it, becau&s;e rea&s;onable Ob|jections may be offered again&s;t &s;ome other Plan, that never has been propo&s;ed for the Colonies.</P>
<P>BUT the Doctor &s;ays: <HI>Whatever the Planners might intend or pretend, if ever an Epi&s;copate is au|thoritatively &s;ettled in America, it may be, for aught any of them all can &s;ay, upon a Plan very different from what they have propo&s;ed.</HI> If the <HI>Antiepi&s;copa|lians</HI> had the Wi&s;dom to &s;ignify their Approbation of this, which in their own Con&s;ciences they know can never hurt them, or the Di&s;cretion not to op|po&s;e it; there could be no Room to doubt, that whenever an Epi&s;copate &s;hould be <HI>authoritatively</HI> &s;ettled in the Colonies, it would be according to a Plan, that had been offered on one Side, and admited on the other, as unexceptionable. But what Alterations unrea&s;onable Oppo&s;ition, attend|ed with the vile&s;t Abu&s;es of the national Church, may occa&s;ion, is more difficult to &s;ay: Although we &s;till hope, that Allowance may be made for
<PB N="212" REF="012007_0219_0F8941392CDE01F8">
Prejudices, and that no Re&s;entment of &s;uch Treat|ment may be &s;hewn, when the De&s;ign for an Ame|rican Epi&s;copate &s;hall come to be put in Executi|on. We wi&s;h to give no Offence to others; we hope no ju&s;t Offence will be ever given. We are willing to forget the Injuries we have received. We would avoid every Appearance that might ex|cite Jealou&s;y; and we &s;hould think our&s;elves hap|py in the Friend&s;hip and Confidence of every re|ligious Denomination in the Colonies. As one Proof of this Di&s;po&s;ition, our cordial Con&s;ent to, and our earne&s;t De&s;ire of, an Epi&s;copate upon the Plan under Con&s;ideration, are offered to the Public.</P>
<P>OF this Mr. Apthorp &s;pake, as
<Q>&s;uch a &s;im|ple and beautiful Plan of the mo&s;t ancient and moderate Epi&s;copacy,</Q>
that it ought to remove the Apprehen&s;ions and Scruples of the mo&s;t Su&s;|picious. The Doctor &s;ays it can be no ju&s;t Plan of the ancient Epi&s;copacy, becau&s;e the Bi&s;hops are to have no Authority over the Laity. But as this Subject has been con&s;idered already, I have no Occa&s;ion to repeat what has been &s;aid.</P>
<P>DR. Mayhew had ridiculed, "with burle&s;que "Gravity," &s;ome Expre&s;&s;ions in the Society's <HI>Ab&s;tract</HI> of 1715, wherein Confirmation was &s;po|ken of. Mr. Apthorp remarked, that
<Q>he well knows, or ea&s;ily may, that we a&s;cribe no more Efficacy to the laying on Bi&s;hop's Hands, than his Brethren do to the laying on of Pre&s;byter's Hands.</Q>
Dr. Chauncy replies, that Mr. Ap|thorp is mi&s;taken with Regard to this Point. For, &s;ays he: <HI>Do Epi&s;copalians never &s;peak of an</HI> INDE|LIBLE CHARACTER <HI>as impre&s;&s;ed by the Bi&s;hop's Hand in Ordination?</HI>&mdash;implying, that the Congregati|onali&s;ts

pretend to no &s;uch Thing. I imagine the Doctor here &s;pake without Attention or Recol|lection; for I am not willing to &s;uppo&s;e, that he does not under&s;tand the Principles of
<Q>his Bre|thren.</Q>
They believe, or <HI>u&s;ed</HI> to believe, that an <HI>indelible Character</HI> is, in &s;ome Ca&s;es, conveyed by them&s;elves, as firmly as we do that &s;uch a Cha|racter is ever given by our Bi&s;hops. By an <HI>indeli|ble Character</HI> is meant, a Character that continues through Life, and of which a Man cannot dive&s;t him&s;elf. Such, for In&s;tance, is the <HI>bapti&s;mal</HI> Cha|racter; which, in the Opinion of all that admini&s;|ter or receive it, can never be laid a&s;ide. He that is once bapti&s;ed, is always con&s;idered, in all Cir|cum&s;tances, as a bapti&s;ed Per&s;on. Should he di&s;|regard the &s;acred Character him&s;elf, &s;hould he a|po&s;tatize from Chri&s;tianity, or be excommunicated from the Church, yet his Bapti&s;m &s;till remains. For &s;hould he return to his Duty, and give &s;uffici|ent Proofs of his Repentance, &s;o that it would be thought proper to re&s;tore him to the Privileges of a Chri&s;tian, a new Bapti&s;m would not be required: The Rea&s;on of which is this, and can be this only, that the bapti&s;mal Character is con&s;idered as <HI>indeli|ble.</HI> This, I believe, is the Opinion of Congre|gationali&s;ts, as well as of others. The Ca&s;e of Or|dination, in this Re&s;pect, is much the &s;ame with that of Bapti&s;m. According to good Information, there have been In&s;tances in New-England, of or|dained Mini&s;ters, that after a while have given up their &s;acred Employment, and become perfectly &s;ecularized&mdash;pur&s;uing, like other Per&s;ons &s;ome of the common Occupations of Life&mdash;and afterwards have re&s;umed their eccle&s;ia&s;tical Functions; to which they have been admited, without Reordina|tion. This is a Proof that, in New-England, the
<PB N="214" REF="012007_0221_0F89413AAC7823D8">
<HI>&s;acerdotal</HI> Character is al&s;o thought to be <HI>indelible.</HI> And indeed when that Character is once commu|nicated, why &s;hould it be more circum&s;cribed, with Regard to Time, than to Place? Why &s;hould it not continue with a Man as long as he lives, as well as accompany him wherever he goes?</P>
<P>MR. Apthorp fairly concluded from Dr. May|hew's Performances, that he was not willing that Epi&s;copalians in the Colonies &s;hould have that Liberty, without which he and his Brethren would not be &s;atisfied them&s;elves. In controverting this Point, Dr. Chauncy builds upon this rotten Foun|dation, that the American Epi&s;copalians have, in Reality, the &s;ame Liberty with other Denomina|tions, in all Re&s;pects; of which nothing farther is needful to be <HI>here</HI> &s;aid.</P>
<P>IT had been mentioned as one Advantage ex|pected from an American Epi&s;copate, that the Clergy here would be under a proper Government. Dr. Mayhew treated this with his u&s;ual Candor and Charity, in&s;inuating that the Epi&s;copal Clergy in America peculiarly required to be "reduced to "Order." Mr. Apthorp an&s;wered, that the con|trary was rather to be infered, from their unani|mous De&s;ire of &s;uch an Epi&s;copate. Dr. Chauncy does not deny the Ju&s;tne&s;s of this Inference, nor di&s;pute but that the Clergy, who have petitioned for Bi&s;hops, are <HI>unanimous, at lea&s;t in Appearance, in their Wi&s;hes to have them</HI>; but he &s;till comforts him&s;elf, that the Clergy in the Epi&s;copal Colonies have not petitioned for, nor &s;hewn them&s;elves to be de&s;irous of American Bi&s;hops; and con&s;equently, that they have not given this Proof of their not being a <HI>di&s;orderly</HI> Set of People. How long this
<PB N="215" REF="012007_0222_0F89413B6C264AB8">
Con&s;olation is like to continue, the Reader may judge from what has been &s;aid; and how much, in the Doctor's Opinion, the Reputation of the Clergy depends upon their petitioning for Bi&s;hops, is wor|thy of Notice, as he undertakes to expre&s;s the Sentiments of his Brethren in general.</P>
<P>THE Ta&s;k of an&s;wering all the Objections and Cavils in the Pamphlet before me, is like that of teaching Children to read in their Primers; it re|quires much Time and Patience, and after all, the Profit is but incon&s;iderable. This Ob&s;ervation was naturally &s;ugge&s;ted by other Parts of the Doctor's Performance; but here, where a Reply to Mr. Apthorp is attempted, it forces it&s;elf &s;o irre&s;i&s;tably upon me, that I am unable to &s;uppre&s;s it. The Exceptions of our Author in general, appear to me to be &s;o very weak and trifling, not to mention the almo&s;t perpetual Repetitions of what had been before &s;aid, that I know not how to reconcile them with his reputed Judgment and good Sen&s;e. How|ever, amid&s;t the&s;e, there are a few Particulars that de&s;erve not to be intirely &s;lighted.</P>
<P>DR. Mayhew had objected again&s;t an American Epi&s;copate, becau&s;e Bi&s;hops had &s;ometimes proved to be ambitious and trouble&s;ome. Mr. Apthorp an&s;wered, that "&s;o are Pre&s;byters&mdash;too often;" and therefore Pre&s;byters might as well be excluded from the Colonies as Bi&s;hops, on that Account. Dr. Chauncy replies: <HI>This proves nothing, unle&s;s he could have &s;aid farther, that their Sphere of In|fluence was equally exten&s;ive, in Con&s;equence of which there was equal Danger, from their intriguing with great Men at home, or with Governors or principal Men here, of carrying into Execution &s;uch Schemes as
<PB N="216" REF="012007_0223_0F89413D15890020">
might be greatly hurtful, both in a civil and religious Sen&s;e,</HI> p. 163. Pre&s;byters mu&s;t always be &s;uppo&s;ed to have <HI>&s;ome</HI> influence; and in Proportion to the Degree and Extent of it, this Objection is equally conclu&s;ive again&s;t them, as again&s;t Bi&s;hops, accord|ing to Mr. Apthorp's Argument: Nay, it will equally conclude again&s;t the Toleration of any Epi&s;copalians at all, in Proportion to their Influ|ence. For the Principle is this&mdash;that wherever Men of other Per&s;ua&s;ions are &s;uppo&s;ed to have an Influence, that may be u&s;ed again&s;t the Congrega|tionali&s;ts, the latter are to oppo&s;e their Exi&s;tence, at lea&s;t, in the &s;ame Country with them&s;elves, and to refu&s;e them the common Rights of Chri&s;tians: On which Principle alone the Oppo&s;ition to the Bi&s;hops of our Plan can be ju&s;tified. The Influence of a Bi&s;hop is undoubtedly greater than that of a Pre&s;by|ter; but the Influence of a Bi&s;hop without any temporal Power, like tho&s;e in Que&s;tion, has never been e&s;teemed formidable in any Country. To object again&s;t &s;uch, is like objecting again&s;t a Man's natural or acquired Abilities; and it may as ju&s;tly be contended, that no Clergyman &s;hould be tolera|ted in America, who&s;e Capacity exceeded a certain Size, or who&s;e Learning exceeded &s;uch a limited Standard. Suppo&s;ing the Influence of an American Bi&s;hop to be equal to that of Twenty Pre&s;byters; yet if there will be a Hundred Pre&s;byters in Ame|rica to one Bi&s;hop, then this Objection will have Five Times the Force again&s;t the Order of Pre&s;by|ters, as again&s;t the Order of Bi&s;hops. If the Doctor would be a&s;hamed of the Objection in one Ca&s;e, he ought not to urge it in the other.</P>
<P>THE Unrea&s;onablene&s;s of the Objection farther appears, from what Mr. Apthorp ju&s;tly ob&s;erves,
<PB N="217" REF="012007_0224_0F89413DB2FF5FC8">
viz. That the Temper of the Engli&s;h Bi&s;hops is now, and has been for a long Time, &s;uch, as af|fords no Room for Jealou&s;y, but intitles them to Confidence. The Doctor is not willing to ac|knowledge this; e&s;pecially <HI>if it be true,</HI> as Dr. Mayhew had been informed, <HI>that High-Church Tory Principles are</HI> [have been] <HI>lately revived in England,</HI> p. 164. This Information may have been <HI>not</HI> true; and &s;uch Principles may have been revived in England, and not countenanced by the Bi&s;hops. The Bi&s;hops at home may have embraced them, and yet Bi&s;hops of other Principles may be &s;ent to America. Be&s;ides, High-Church Principles (to u&s;e the Doctor's <HI>Cant</HI>) are not nece&s;&s;arily into|lerant; and no Principles but tho&s;e of Intolerance are ju&s;tly to be dreaded. That the Bi&s;hops at home are Friends to religious Liberty, and di&s;po&s;ed, not to oppre&s;s, but to oblige the Di&s;&s;enters, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of the latter have candidly confe&s;&s;ed. The late excellent Archbi&s;hop Secker was, in the Doctor's Phra&s;eology, a <HI>High-Flyer</HI> in his Principles; and yet he was as forward to do kind Offices to Prote&s;tants of other Principles, as they them&s;elves could rea&s;onably wi&s;h. An In&s;tance of this Kind, and of the Chri&s;tian Temper and Genero&s;ity of the whole Bench of Bi&s;hops, that ought never to be forgotten, is publi&s;hed in his <HI>Life.</HI> In 1743
<Q>his Lord&s;hip (then Bi&s;hop of Oxford) received a Letter from Dr. Wi&s;hart, Provo&s;t of Edinburgh College, recommending to him his Brother and Mr. Wallace, Deputies from the e&s;tabli&s;hed Clergy of Scotland, to promote a Bill in Parlia|ment for providing a Maintenance for their Widows and Children, which many of them imagined the Bi&s;hops would oppo&s;e. Dr. Secker paid them all the Civility, and did them all the
<PB N="218" REF="012007_0225_0F89413E6CD16768">
Service he could. <HI>None of the Bench oppo&s;ed their Bill</HI> either publickly or privately, and <HI>it was moved for by a Bi&s;hop at each of its three Rea|dings</HI> in the Hou&s;e of Lords <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Life</HI> of Archbi&s;hop Secker, by the Doctors, Porteus and Stinton, p. 25.</NOTE>.</Q>
The late Dr. S. Chandler, who was intimate with his Grace and &s;everal of the Bi&s;hops, and knew them all, thought there could be no Danger from their Di&s;po&s;ition, nor from any other Quarter, that would ju&s;tify an Oppo&s;ition to the Epi&s;copate of our Plan; and therefore, like a wi&s;e and hone&s;t Man, and a real Friend to religious Liberty, he freely &s;ignified his Approbation of it.</P>
<P>DR. Mayhew objected, that &s;uppo&s;ing Bi&s;hops &s;hould be at fir&s;t &s;ent in the Manner propo&s;ed, yet there was no Certainty that they and their Succe&s;|&s;ors would remain contented, very long, under &s;uch Limitations. Mr. Apthorp replied:
<Q>Who knows whether the New-Englanders will not hang Quakers&mdash;again,</Q>
as, in one of their Colonies, they did formerly? This was a &s;ufficient An&s;wer to &s;o unrea&s;onable an Objection; e&s;pecially as Dr. Mayhew him&s;elf had admini&s;tered an Anti|dote again&s;t the Poi&s;on of his own Argument, in the&s;e Words:
<Q>It is readily owned, that our Ap|prehen&s;ions of what may po&s;&s;ibly or probably be the Con&s;equences of Bi&s;hops being &s;ent hither, <HI>ought not to put us on infringing the religious Li|berty of our Fellow Subjects,</HI> and Chri&s;tian Bre|thren<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dr. Mayhew's <HI>Second Defence,</HI> p. 69.</NOTE>.</Q>
But Mr. Apthorp proceeds:
<Q>The Clergy of England are in general Friends to religious Freedom: The People of England, Whigs and Tories, are unfavourable to clerical
<PB N="219" REF="012007_0226_0F89413F2F309CB8">
Power; and a far greater Danger than the Doctor's imaginary one, is, that of their laying a&s;ide all Regard to the Chri&s;tian Mini&s;try, in every Shape, and to Chri&s;tianity it&s;elf.</Q></P>
<P>THE Reader will ob&s;erve, that the preceeding Objection does, in Effect, admit of an Epi&s;copate on the pre&s;ent Plan; for it is made only on the Suppo&s;ition that this Plan may be altered; and the po&s;&s;ible or probable <HI>Alteration</HI> is its only Object. But of any material Alteration of the Plan we &s;ee no Probability. In this Country, we do not de&s;ire it; at home, there appears no Di&s;po&s;ition to make it: And after a Plan of &s;uch a Nature has been once put in Execution, e&s;pecially if Men on all Sides &s;hall appear to have been &s;atisfied with it, every Day will render an Alteration more difficult. The general Di&s;po&s;ition, as Mr. Apthorp ob&s;erved, is friendly to religious Liberty: It is far more likely to increa&s;e than dimini&s;h; and therefore it is mo&s;t probable, that no Alterations will be made, in this or any other Plan, that are unfavourable to the religious Rights of any Denomination of Chri&s;tians. Upon this general Di&s;po&s;ition of our Superiors, which is a Security to others, we al&s;o depend&mdash;for the full Enjoyment of the In&s;titutions of the Church in the Colonies; in Order to which, an Epi&s;copate is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. An Epi&s;co|pate therefore we claim, as one of the common Rights of Chri&s;tians, and as Subjects of a free Government. Every Oppo&s;ition to our Claim is an Infringement of religious Liberty; we cannot but look upon it in this Light our&s;elves, and we doubt not but the Government, when the Subject &s;hall be taken into Con&s;ideration, will look upon it in the &s;ame Light.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="012007_0227_0F89413FEE1D0DC0">TO the foregoing Repre&s;entation of Mr. Ap|thorp, the Doctor replies: <HI>All this being taken for granted, yet</HI> MAY <HI>not Times alter, and Admini&s;tra|tions change?</HI> p. 165. This is bringing the Argu|ment back, from Probability to Po&s;&s;ibility. If the general Di&s;po&s;ition is more favourable to reli|gious Liberty than it ever has been, Appearances are on the &s;ide of religious Liberty. <HI>Times</HI> do not ea&s;ily <HI>alter</HI> in &s;uch Re&s;pects. A national Character is not &s;oon lo&s;t; Changes of <HI>Admini&s;tration,</HI> unle&s;s it falls into the Hands of Foreigners, &s;eldom affect it. There can be no greater Security to any Privi|lege or Right, than that the Sentiments and Di&s;|po&s;ition of the Public are known to favour it. To object therefore the <HI>Po&s;&s;ibility</HI> that the be&s;t Security may fail, &s;hews the Situation and Temper of our Adver&s;aries. Their Situation is &s;uch, that, for Want of plau&s;ible Objections, they are obliged to u&s;e tho&s;e that are mon&s;trous and &s;hocking: And their Temper is &s;uch, that they are determined, at any Rate, to oppo&s;e our Enjoyment of equal Pri|vileges with them&s;elves. They clearly di&s;cover, that they will never con&s;ent to our having an Epi&s;|copate in any Form, by oppo&s;ing one in the mo&s;t unexceptionable Form that can be mentioned. In|deed the Doctor has con&s;ented that we may have Bi&s;hops from the Moravians; but he may as well retract this, as his other Conce&s;&s;ions. And if our Plan had been to have Moravian Bi&s;hops, he would probably have contended as furiou&s;ly again&s;t them, as again&s;t tho&s;e that have been reque&s;ted.</P>
<P>HE urges, in the Words of Dr. Mayhew: <HI>We are certainly more &s;ure again&s;t Oppre&s;&s;ion</HI> (by Bi|&s;hops) <HI>in the Ab&s;ence of Bi&s;hops, than we &s;hould be if they were once fixed here.</HI> It appears then, as I
<PB N="221" REF="012007_0228_0F894140ACE54170">
have ju&s;t ob&s;erved, that no other Security will &s;a|tisfy &s;ome People, than our having no Bi&s;hops at all. However, as there is no Probability, hardly a Po&s;&s;ibility, that &s;uch an unrea&s;onable Oppo&s;ition &s;hould prevent it, it concerns them to con&s;ider the following Words of Mr. Apthorp:
<Q>They (Bi|&s;hops) <HI>may</HI> &s;oon be &s;ent, and with much greater Authority than is a&s;ked for them now; and perhaps <HI>with &s;ome</HI> RESENTMENT <HI>of the Oppo&s;i|tion made to them before.</HI></Q>
Should this be the Ca&s;e, which I hope it may not be, the blind and impetuous Zeal of the&s;e Sticklers again&s;t Bi&s;hops, may in &s;ome Mea&s;ure excu&s;e, but it can never atone for, the Mi&s;chief they will have occa&s;ioned to their own Party.</P>
<P>MR. Apthorp proceeds:
<Q>Engli&s;h Di&s;&s;enters, who have Six and Twenty Bi&s;hops e&s;tabli&s;hed among them, fear no Harm from them. Why then &s;hould the New-England Di&s;&s;enters fear any, if one or two &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed, with much le&s;s Power, in one or two neighbouring Provinces?</Q>
The Doctor replies, that if the Di&s;|&s;enters at home <HI>fear no Harm</HI> from the Bi&s;hops, yet they <HI>&s;uffer</HI> it. <HI>They are, and ever will be, in &s;uf|fering Circum&s;tances; unle&s;s the E&s;tabli&s;hment of the Church of England is di&s;&s;olved, or greatly altered.</HI> p. 166. Whatever they &s;uffer from the national E&s;tabli&s;hment, is here charged to the Account of the pre&s;ent Bi&s;hops. But did they make the E&s;ta|bli&s;hment? Is it in their Power to alter it? Or if it was, would it be right in them to give up the legal Advantages of that Church, with the Inter|e&s;ts of which they are intru&s;ted, before they find it to be agreeable to the Generality of its Mem|bers? Indeed were tho&s;e Advantages founded in
<PB N="222" REF="012007_0229_0F8941416D92F248">
the Oppre&s;&s;ion of other People, the Bi&s;hops ought in Duty to u&s;e their Influence that the Oppre&s;&s;ion might be removed. But the Engli&s;h Di&s;&s;enters feel them&s;elves to be not oppre&s;&s;ed; and many of them are &s;en&s;ible of the peculiar Mildne&s;s and Moderation, not only of the Bi&s;hops, but of the national E&s;tabli&s;hment. No Di&s;&s;enters from the e&s;tabli&s;hed Religion in any Country on Earth, have le&s;s Rea&s;on to complain of their <HI>&s;uffering Circum|&s;tances,</HI> than tho&s;e in England. If the Doctor has Reference to what they contribute for the Support of the parochial Clergy, exclu&s;ively of Tithes, it amounts to but a Trifle; and what they pay in Tithes, is not, nor has it ever been, any Part of their own Property, as was &s;hewn in the <HI>Appeal.</HI> If he refers to their Exclu&s;ion, from civil Offices under the Government; many of them find Ways to evade the Law, &s;o that the Exclu&s;ion, in Effect, is far from being general. But were it univer&s;al, their <HI>Suffering</HI> would con&s;i&s;t only in not being ad|mitted to certain political <HI>Favors</HI>; Favors which are not granted them, on Account only of their known Di&s;po&s;ition to abu&s;e them, to the Injury of the national E&s;tabli&s;hment. In the mean Time, they have every Indulgence that is requi&s;ite to the full Enjoyment of religious Liberty. They are al|lowed to exerci&s;e their own Form of eccle&s;ia&s;tical Government&mdash;they are allowed to ordain their own Mini&s;ters (Privileges which the Epi&s;copalians in America &s;till want, and may for ever want, with the good Will of &s;ome People)&mdash;they are allowed to wor&s;hip God in their own Way without Con|trol&mdash;they are allowed to make Pro&s;elytes, if they can, from the national Church&mdash;and, notwith|&s;tanding certain Statutes and Canons, they are not re&s;trained by the Government from publickly a|bu&s;ing
<PB N="223" REF="012007_0230_0F8941422CFBE650">
the national E&s;tabli&s;hment, to the Mildne&s;s of which they are indebted for the&s;e Indulgences. After all this, they can have no great Rea&s;on to complain of their <HI>&s;uffering Circum&s;tances.</HI></P>
<P>DR. Mayhew pretended to be apprehen&s;ive, that the Bi&s;hops propo&s;ed might be &s;upported by a Tax upon the Colonies. Mr. Apthorp an&s;wered, that until a proper Maintenance could be otherwi&s;e provided, none would be &s;ent; as was evident from Bi&s;hop Butler's Plan, with which all the others a|greed. Here Dr. Chauncy &s;eems to have been ex|hau&s;ted; and he &s;ays in Reply, or rather in&s;tead of a Reply: <HI>It is not po&s;&s;ible any one &s;hould have a Conception of the Pertinency, Force, and</HI> ELEGANCE <HI>of the Doctor's Objection, as &s;et forth at large in his rea&s;oning upon it, by reading only this cur&s;ory, &s;lighty, and, I may &s;ay, triflng An&s;wer to it.</HI> p. 167. Here is a new Quality a&s;cribed to Objections. I have heard of elegant Expre&s;&s;ions, and elegant Compo&s;itions; but of <HI>elegant Objections</HI> I have ne|ver before heard. It &s;eems then, that as an Ob|jection may be <HI>pertinent</HI> and not <HI>forcible,</HI> or <HI>forci|ble</HI> and not <HI>pertinent,</HI> &s;o an Objection, that is nei|ther <HI>forcible</HI> nor <HI>pertinent,</HI> may &s;till be <HI>elegant</HI>; and on that Account be worthy of Attention. Mr. Apthorp, I believe, confined him&s;elf to the Con|&s;ideration of the <HI>Pertinency</HI> and <HI>Force,</HI> without thinking it worth while to attend to the ELEGANCE, of the Objections before him. But enough of this.</P>
<P>THE Doctor goes on for three or four Pages more, in his Controver&s;y with Mr. Apthorp&mdash;<HI>nib|ling at here and there a Sentence which he is plea&s;ed to pick out</HI>; but he &s;ays nothing of any Con&s;e|quence,
<PB N="224" REF="012007_0231_0F894142ED0B5F40">
nor does he introduce Dr. Mayhew as &s;ay|ing any Thing of Con&s;equence, that has not been fairly obviated in the Cour&s;e of the preceding Pages. Although I am tired of the Drudgery I have undergone, yet I beg Leave to a&s;&s;ure the Reader that my Re&s;olution continues, to pa&s;s by nothing that can de&s;erve his Notice: But after his Kindne&s;s, in accompanying me thus far through a di&s;agreeable Road, I think it would be ungenerous to detain him with Trifles, e&s;pecially when he is &s;o near to the End of his Journey. I &s;hall <HI>therefore</HI> pa&s;s over what has been farther offered in Reply to Mr. Apthorp; and examine what remains, relating more immediately to my&s;elf; which con&s;i&s;ts almo&s;t intirely of Repetitions, and partly of double Re|petitions, of what has been &s;aid before.</P>
<P>AND nothing worthy of Attention appears, be|fore we come to p. 173. I had &s;aid:
<Q>Our Claim is, that we may be upon an equal Foot|ing with the other religious Denominations in America. In Order to this, it is nece&s;&s;ary that we be allowed the Enjoyment of our <HI>eccle&s;ia&s;tical</HI> Con&s;titution, in the &s;ame compleat Manner as it is enjoyed by them.</Q>
The Doctor replies, that &s;uch a compleat Enjoyment of it, is not agreeable to <HI>the propo&s;ed Plan</HI>; for that it mu&s;t be attended with <HI>&s;piritual Courts, and the Exerci&s;e of epi&s;copal Authority in the &s;ame preci&s;e Way and Manner that has been e&s;tabli&s;hed by King and Parliament.</HI> But this is a manife&s;t Perver&s;ion of very plain Language. The Word <HI>eccle&s;ia&s;tical</HI> has two Meanings: In a &s;trict Sen&s;e it means what belongs to the Church originally, as a &s;piritual Society, without any Re|lation to the State. It al&s;o means, in a larger or laxer Sen&s;e, whatever belongs to the Church; and
<PB N="225" REF="012007_0232_0F894143AD1C5ED0">
includes all tho&s;e external Circum&s;tances and Re|gulations, which the Church may receive from the civil Authority. The&s;e two Sen&s;es are materially different; and when the Word is evidently u&s;ed in one of them only, it is unfair and &s;ophi&s;tical to interpret it in the other. The Plea for the Epi&s;|copate in Que&s;tion, from the very Beginning, con|&s;idered the Epi&s;copalians in America as a religious Society; and what was a&s;ked or propo&s;ed in Favor of it, was <HI>purely</HI> of a &s;piritual or <HI>eccle&s;ia&s;tical</HI> Na|ture, in the fir&s;t and &s;trict Sen&s;e of the Word. The <HI>Appendages</HI> added by the Government to the &s;ame Church in England, were never con&s;idered as any Part of its real Sub&s;tance, or as e&s;&s;ential to its in|ternal Con&s;titution, even there. The Church has a Con&s;titution of its own, given it by its divine Founder, which continues the &s;ame, both in Pro&s;|perity and Adver&s;ity, whether favored or per&s;e|cuted by the Powers of the World; and the Doc|tor knows, that it was the compleat Enjoyment of this Con&s;titution only that was &s;poken of. To talk therfore of &s;uch <HI>&s;piritual Courts</HI> as have been erected in England, and &s;uch Modes as have been e&s;tabli&s;hed by the civil Authority, as Parts of our <HI>eccle&s;ia&s;tical Con&s;titution,</HI> is a poor quibbling with Words, and utterly unworthy of a fair Di&s;putant.</P>
<P>ALL that was claimed as a Right, in Behalf of the Epi&s;copalians in America, amounted only to a Toleration&mdash;&s;uch a Toleration as &s;uffers the Church to exi&s;t here 'in all its Parts.' The like Perver|&s;ion is made of this Expre&s;&s;ion; for the whole Tenor of the <HI>Appeal,</HI> and the <HI>Defence</HI> of it, &s;hew|ed my Meaning to be, all its <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> Parts, or all its Parts con&s;idered barely as an eccle&s;ia&s;tical Soci|ety, unallied with the State. To countenance the
<PB N="226" REF="012007_0233_0F8941446C755900">
Abu&s;e, the Doctor has added, in Capitals, IN ALL RESPECTS; as if I had in&s;i&s;ted, that the Church &s;hould not only be allowed to exi&s;t here
<Q>in all its Parts,</Q>
but <HI>in all Re&s;pects as it does in England.</HI> But as I did not u&s;e the Expre&s;&s;ion my&s;elf; &s;o I &s;aid nothing that could ju&s;tify the Doctor's U&s;e of it, in &s;uch a Manner.</P>
<P>HE next introduces, once more, a <HI>State-E&s;ta|bli&s;hment,</HI> which has been already con&s;idered; and on which therefore I &s;hall not enlarge in this Place. He contends that the Epi&s;copate propo&s;ed nece&s;&s;a|rily implies &s;uch an E&s;tabli&s;hment; and his Me|thod of arguing is recommended to the Attention of &s;uch Readers as are fond of 'Curio&s;ities.' <HI>A|merican Bi&s;hops,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>&s;hall have no Authority over the Laity;&mdash;their &s;piritual Courts mu&s;t not be held in this Part of the World;&mdash;and they them|&s;elves are to be confined in their Power within certain pre&s;cribed Boundaries. How is all this to be accom|pli&s;hed? Mu&s;t there not be the Interpo&s;ition of the State? Can it be affected in any other Way?&mdash;And what is this, in real Meaning, but an E&s;tabli&s;hment?</HI> p. 176. I know not that the Interpo&s;ition of the State is at all nece&s;&s;ary, in Order to the compleat Execution of our whole Plan. If it be nece&s;&s;ary, it is only to limit and circum&s;cribe the Authority of the intended Bi&s;hops. Such an Interpo&s;ition is properly a <HI>Re&s;traint,</HI> and not an <HI>E&s;tabli&s;hment</HI>; and the <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Toleration</HI> may, with much greater Pro|priety, be called an <HI>E&s;tabli&s;hment</HI> of the various tolerated Sects, in England. I cannot conclude this Remark without ob&s;erving, that if the Doctor will have a Language peculiar to him&s;elf; if he will u&s;e Words in &s;uch a Sen&s;e as no Mortal ever u&s;ed them before him; he ought to publi&s;h a
<PB N="227" REF="012007_0234_0F89414588809ED8">
<HI>Glo&s;&s;ary,</HI> wherein the Singularities of his Phra&s;eo|logy are carefully explained.</P>
<P>I HAVE now con&s;idered every Thing in Dr. Chauncy's Pamphlet, that could with any Propri|ety, be brought before the Public, as worthy of Notice. I have attended to the <HI>Pertinency</HI> and <HI>Force,</HI> although not to the ELEGANCE, of all his Objections again&s;t an American Epi&s;copate, on the Plan of the <HI>Appeal,</HI> as well as again&s;t the Church of England, and the truly venerable Society for the Propagation of the Go&s;pel. I am not con&s;ci|ous that I have mi&s;repre&s;ented his Sentiments or his Arguments in any In&s;tance. I have pa&s;&s;ed over nothing, becau&s;e I found it difficult to be an&s;|wered. And if I may be allowed to expre&s;s my own Opinion, it is clearly this, that all he has of|fered relating to the&s;e &s;everal Subjects, is either weak or impertinent; and if this has not been &s;hewn, to the Satisfaction of the impartial Rea|der, I am greatly mi&s;taken. Indeed the Doctor &s;peaks of his own Performance with high Confi|dence, and with &s;till higher Confidence, of his own Abilities. He &s;ays that I have not written in &s;uch a Manner, <HI>as to give</HI> him <HI>an Opportunity for the</HI> TRIAL OF STRENGTH. p. 178. Such a <HI>Brag|ger</HI> I have not met with, &s;ince I was a School-Boy. He may conceit him&s;elf to be an <HI>Hercules</HI>; but in this Pamphlet however, he appears, like the real Hercules at the Court of Omphale, to have acted unworthily of &s;uch a Character.</P>
<P>HE <HI>intended,</HI> it &s;eems, <HI>to have come to a Conclu|&s;ion</HI> HERE (by not concluding <HI>here,</HI> but) <HI>by pre&s;ent|ing to the Reader, in one View, the Sum of what has been &s;aid on both Sides, that he might the more
<PB N="228" REF="012007_0235_0F89414728F55A00">
ea&s;ily make a Judgment in the Ca&s;e.</HI> But he was di|verted by what he calls <HI>a Matter of much greater Importance, the Treatment of the Pre&s;byterian Church at New-York, in Relation to the Charter they peti|tioned for.</HI> This he thinks &s;ufficient to &s;pread <HI>an Alarm</HI> through <HI>all the Colonies on the Continent, giving them &s;olemn Notice what they may expect, &s;hould Epi&s;copalians ever come to have the Superiori|ty in their Influence.</HI> And he gives a partial Hi&s;|tory of the Affair, contra&s;ted with the Proceed|ings of the Bo&s;ton A&s;&s;embly in pa&s;&s;ing an Act, in Con&s;equence of which, the Church of England in the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts receives Benefit.</P>
<P>THE Di&s;appointment of the Pre&s;byterians in New-York, with Regard to a Charter, he had mentioned in his former Pamphlet; and enough was &s;aid in An&s;wer, to &s;hew that they have, upon the whole, no great Rea&s;ons for Complaint. A|mong other Things, it was ob&s;erved, in the <HI>Appeal defended,</HI> that
<Q>it was the Belief at home, that the Church of England had been treated with pecu|liar Malevolence, by &s;ome of tho&s;e very Per&s;ons who&s;e Names were annexed to the Petition. It was therefore not unnatural to &s;u&s;pect, that any additional Power put into the Hands of &s;uch Per&s;ons, would, as Opportunity &s;hould offer, be exerted again&s;t the Church.</Q>
If nothing farther could be &s;aid, yet &s;o long as this was <HI>believed</HI> to be the Ca&s;e, whether ju&s;tly or not: it was of it&s;elf a &s;ufficient Rea&s;on&mdash;not for abridging the religious Liberty&mdash;but for not enlarging the Power, of the Pre&s;byterians in New-York. And yet Dr. Chauncy takes not the lea&s;t Notice of this Ob&s;ervation, nor of any Thing I &s;aid relating to the Subject; but &s;ounds a fal&s;e Alarm to all the Colonies, to prepare
<PB N="229" REF="012007_0236_0F8941476C583410">
for a Defence, again&s;t the oppre&s;&s;ive De&s;igns of the Church of England.</P>
<P>BUT the Refu&s;al of Favors by the Government, to particular Per&s;ons who had made them&s;elves ob|noxious to Government, by a &s;uppo&s;ed &s;currilous Abu&s;e of the national E&s;tabli&s;hment, which ought always to be treated with Decency, is no Proof of the ill Temper of Epi&s;copalians, nor an Argu|ment of the Unwillingne&s;s of Government to grant Favors to other Per&s;ons, although of the &s;ame re|ligious Denomination, that have not di&s;covered the &s;ame Di&s;po&s;ition:&mdash;Much le&s;s does it prove any De&s;ign, to deprive &s;uch Per&s;ons of any Privileges, of which they are in fair and legal Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. If the Conduct of the Pre&s;byterians in New-York has been mi&s;taken, or mi&s;repre&s;ented, let it be made to appear. If they, or their Friends, can prove, or make it probable, that they have not publickly vilified and abu&s;ed the national Church, and that they have been free from all &s;ecret Intrigues and Combinations again&s;t it; in my Opinion, they, as well as other Prote&s;tants, are intitled to all Favors from the Patrons of the Church, that are con|&s;i&s;tent with Safety, or the Con&s;titution. But on the other Hand, if they are con&s;cious of their own evil Intentions and Practices again&s;t the Church of England, and know that &s;ome of them have been actually di&s;covered; it is &s;urpri&s;ing that they can expect, much more that they can have the A&s;&s;u|rance to a&s;k, particular Favors, to the granting of which, the Con&s;ent of tho&s;e, who regard the In|tere&s;t and Honor of the Church, is nece&s;&s;ary. I will not enter farther into the Conduct or the Ca&s;e of the Pre&s;byterians in New-York. Let them but clear them&s;elves of the Charges and Su&s;picions
<PB N="230" REF="012007_0237_0F894148325427C0">
with which they are loaded; and then, if any rea|&s;onable Favors are refu&s;ed them, barely on Ac|count of their religious Principles, the Di&s;&s;enters throughout the Colonies will have ju&s;t Rea&s;on to expect the &s;ame Treatment, and not before.</P>
<P>AS to the above-mentioned Act of the Bo&s;ton A&s;&s;embly, it &s;hews, according to the Doctor's Ac|count of it, a Genero&s;ity that is highly commenda|ble and worthy of Imitation. As I am unwilling to entertain any unfavorable Su&s;picions in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, I &s;hould not que&s;tion the Fairne&s;s of the Repre&s;entation; were it not that the Doctor tri|umphs &s;o unmercifully in the <HI>Act,</HI> and takes occa&s;ion from it to vilify and abu&s;e the Church of England. I &s;hall <HI>therefore</HI> take the Liberty to ob&s;erve, that the chief Object in View, was evidently to favor certain <HI>Pa&s;tors and Deacons,</HI> and not the Church&mdash; and that, although the Church was benefited, yet <HI>if</HI> the Clau&s;es in its Favor were in&s;erted, as &s;ome &s;uppo&s;e, in Order to &s;ecure to the Bill a Pa&s;&s;age through all the Branches of the provincial Legi&s;la|ture, or a Confirmation in England, the Favor was granted on mercenary Principles, and the Merit of the <HI>Act,</HI> in Point of Genero&s;ity to the Church, is nothing at all. Whether this, or any other private Advantage, was the prevailing Mo|tive, with the Bo&s;ton A&s;&s;embly, for favoring the Church of England, the Doctor probably knows; and <HI>if</HI> it was, others know, that the <HI>Act</HI> de&s;erves not the Prai&s;e that he a&s;cribes to it.</P>
<P>AS the Doctor was diverted from his <HI>Intention</HI> of &s;uming up <HI>what had been &s;aid on both Sides</HI>; in Order partly to &s;upply his Omi&s;&s;ion, I will conclude,
<PB N="231" REF="012007_0238_0F894148ECAD4950">
with a &s;hort Account of the Ri&s;e, Progre&s;s, and pre&s;ent State of this Controver&s;y.</P>
<P>IT began with the <HI>Appeal to the Public,</HI> which was made in Behalf of the Epi&s;copalians in Ame|rica, amounting, in the Colonies and I&s;lands, as was believed, to near a Million of People. While every other Denomination of Prote&s;tants in the Briti&s;h Dominions had an unre&s;trained Enjoyment of their re&s;pective Sy&s;tems of eccle&s;ia&s;tical Govern|ment, and could perform within them&s;elves all tho&s;e religious Offices and Acts which their Prin|ciples required; it was thought to be a great and very extraordinary Hard&s;hip, that the American Epi&s;copalians, in Communion with, and Mem|bers of, the national e&s;tabli&s;hed Church, &s;hould continue to &s;uffer for Want of the like Privileges &mdash;which they could not enjoy without re&s;ident Bi&s;hops.</P>
<P>THE Di&s;advantages they were under, were con|&s;idered under the three Heads, of Ordination, Go|vernment, and Confirmation. As to Ordination, they were unable to obtain it for their Candidates without &s;ending them to England, with great Ex|pence, and Danger to their Per&s;ons, to &s;ay no|thing of the Lo&s;s of Time. The Expence of &s;uch a Voyage, was known to be often more, and &s;eldom le&s;s, than &pound;. 100 Sterling to each Candi|date. The Danger of it was &s;uch as had actually produced a double Decimation of the Candidates, Ten out of Fifty-Two, who at that Time had gone home from the northern Colonies, having pe|ri&s;hed in and by the Voyage; not to mention &s;everal others, that have been deprived of their Liberty, and dragged into mi&s;erable Captivity,
<PB N="232" REF="012007_0239_0F894149ACF85828">
where, for a long while, they &s;uffered all that could be &s;uffered, in Pri&s;ons and Dungeons. Under the next Head, it was &s;hewn, that the Clergy of an epi&s;copal Church cannot be properly and regularly governed, without Bi&s;hops; and that the Influence of an Epi&s;copate, at the Di&s;tance of England from America, can be but little better, in this Re&s;|pect, than none at all. It was al&s;o made abun|dantly evident, that the general Reputation of the Church in the Colonies, and the Pro&s;perity and Hap|pine&s;s of particular Congregations, greatly depend upon an American Epi&s;copate. As to Confirmati|on, which is an eccle&s;ia&s;tical In&s;titution, autho|rized by the Practice of the Apo&s;tles, and the Per|formance of which has always been appropriated to Bi&s;hops; the Church of England e&s;teems the Be|nefits ari&s;ing from it to be great and important, and the Want of them mu&s;t be proportionably affect|ing to its Members.</P>
<P>IN Order that the&s;e peculiar Di&s;advantages of the Church of England in the Colonies might be removed, it was reque&s;ted that Bi&s;hops might be allowed to re&s;ide in America. But as in mo&s;t of the Colonies, the Epi&s;copalians were intermixed with a larger Number of People of different reli|gious Principles, the Impropriety of &s;uch an Epi&s;|copate here as was e&s;tabli&s;hed in England, was ob|vious on all Sides. It would naturally abridge &s;ome of the religious Liberties, of which the va|rious Denominations in the Colonies had been long and fairly in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and this probably would be attended with Di&s;content and Clamor, and might be productive of unhappy Con&s;equences.</P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="012007_0240_0F89414A6D9FF268">TO guard again&s;t the&s;e Inconveniencies, a Plan for an Epi&s;copate had been formed, that was pe|culiarly adapted to the Circum&s;tances of &s;uch a Country; and by the Execution of which it was imagined that the &s;piritual Nece&s;&s;ities of the Church of England in the Colonies might be relieved, while no Harm could be done to other Chri&s;tians; and no ju&s;t Cau&s;e of Offence would be given. The Bi&s;hops propo&s;ed were to have no temporal Pow|er, and con&s;equently to hold no Courts for the Ex|erci&s;e of it&mdash;they were to have no Juri&s;diction at all over any of the Di&s;&s;enters, but to govern the epi&s;|copal Clergy only&mdash;they were to have no Mainte|nance from the Colonies in any Form&mdash;they were not to interfere in any Matters of civil Govern|ment, but to be confined to the Exerci&s;e of their &s;piritual Functions only. This general Plan had been honored, at home, with the Approbation of all the Patrons of an American Epi&s;copate, for a long Cour&s;e of Years; it had been cordially adopted by all the Clergy in the Colonies, and their Friends, that had attended to the Subject; and many Petitions in Favor of it had been tran&s;|mited to our Superiors in England.</P>
<P>WHILE the Matter was thus in Agitation, and before it &s;hould proceed farther, it was thought by the Clergy of the united Convention of New-York and New-Jer&s;ey, that it would be received as a Proof of their upright and candid Intentions, if an Account &s;hould be <HI>publi&s;hed,</HI> by their Directi|on; &s;eting forth the Nece&s;&s;ity of an American Epi&s;copate, explaining the Nature of the Epi&s;co|pate propo&s;ed, and a&s;&s;uring the Public that no|thing was de&s;igned again&s;t the Liberty or Property of any Kind of People whatever:&mdash;And the Au|thor was appointed to perform this Service. He
<PB N="234" REF="012007_0241_0F89414B2D2144B8">
executed the Tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him with &s;uch Abi|lities as he had; and he was certainly <HI>faithful</HI> in the Di&s;charge of it. At the &s;ame Time he &s;tudied to give no Offence to any Denomination of Chri&s;tians; and, as he had Occa&s;ion to mention any of them, he treated them always re&s;pectfully. The Nature of his Work led him to con&s;ider &s;uch Objections again&s;t an American Epi&s;copate, as he had heard of, or &s;uppo&s;ed might be naturally made, by Peo|ple of different Views and Intere&s;ts; and all &s;uch as occurred to him were carefully con&s;idered, and, as he thought, &s;hewn to be groundle&s;s. However, as he knew that others might be of a different Opi|nion, if any were di&s;&s;atisfied with what had been &s;aid, or had any new Objections to offer, they were invited to &s;ignify it, and
<Q>to propo&s;e them in &s;uch a Manner, that they might be fairly and candidly debated, before the Tribunal of the Public.</Q></P>
<P>THE <HI>Appeal</HI> was publi&s;hed: And what &s;hortly after en&s;ued on the Occa&s;ion, what inflammatory periodical Papers and Pamphlets <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The above&s;aid <HI>periodical Papers,</HI> with the periodical <HI>An|&s;wers</HI> to them, have been collected and reprinted by Mr. <HI>Holt,</HI> in 3 Vols. 8vo. and are to be &s;old at his Printing-Office in New-York; the above&s;aid <HI>Pamphlets</HI> never will be reprinted.</NOTE> from different Quarters, were i&s;&s;ued in An&s;wer to it, is well known. An Alarm was &s;ounded throughout the Colonies, that a general Inva&s;ion of their religious Liberty was projected&mdash;the Minds of the Popu|lace were inflamed, by Arts that were wicked and infamous&mdash;the Church of England, the whole Or|der of Bi&s;hops, and the Clergy of our Convention, were &s;hamefully abu&s;ed in the common News-Pa|pers&mdash;and a double Portion of the Abu&s;e naturally fell upon the Author of the <HI>Appeal.</HI> However un|expected
<PB N="235" REF="012007_0242_0F89414BEE40E1A0">
and unde&s;erved a Reception his Publica|tion met with from &s;ome People, he was re&s;olved notwith&s;tanding to take it patiently, and carefully to ob&s;erve whatever might be &s;aid by his Adver&s;a|ries, that might de&s;erve Attention, and in due Time to reply to it.</P>
<P>BEFORE the Publication of the <HI>Appeal,</HI> the prin|cipal Objections again&s;t an Epi&s;copate here, and the chief Source of Men's Di&s;affection towards it, were the&s;e Two; that in Con&s;equence of &s;uch an Appointment, they &s;hould become &s;ubject to the Payment of <HI>Tithes,</HI> and to <HI>&s;piritual Courts</HI>; of which they had met with tremendous De&s;criptions.</P>
<P>THE Ca&s;e of Tithes, which was generally mi&s;un|der&s;tood, was therefore carefully explained; and it was proved, that Tithes in England which are not paid to the Bi&s;hops, but to the parochial Clergy, are claimed by Virtue of an ancient Gift, whereby they were made the Property of the Church&mdash; that in this Country, as no Tithes had been given to the Church, none could be demanded; and were it otherwi&s;e, that they would belong to the Cler|gy, and be as recoverable without an Epi&s;copate as with&mdash;and as to the propo&s;ed Bi&s;hops, that a Fund in England was rai&s;ed for their Support, and that no Part of their Maintenance was ever intended to be drawn from the Americans. The Subject was placed in &s;o clear and convincing a Light, that none of my Opponents have in&s;i&s;ted upon the Objection. The Point has been given up on all Hands; and People in general are intirely ea&s;y on this Account, being abundantly &s;atisfied, that they &s;hall be &s;ubject to no Inconvenience for the <HI>Support</HI> of &s;uch an Epi&s;copate, as has been reque&s;ted.</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="012007_0243_0F89414CAC128050">AS to &s;piritual Courts, the Plan ab&s;olutely ex|cludes all Foundation or Pretence for them. For if the Bi&s;hops are to exerci&s;e no Authority over any but the epi&s;copal Clergy, none but the Clergy them&s;elves can be brought into their Courts; and neither the Laity of our own Communion, nor any People of other Communions, can be injured in this Re&s;pect. All that has been &s;aid in Oppo&s;ition to this Evidence, has been either trifling or im|pertinent.</P>
<P>WHEN it was found that nothing of Con&s;equence could be objected again&s;t the Plan it&s;elf, it was in|&s;i&s;ted that &s;uch a Plan was never intended to be put in Execution, but that a different Epi&s;copate was really de&s;igned; and Dr. Chauncy intimated, that he had di&s;covered &s;ome Secrets that would ju&s;tify the Charge. He was called upon to pro|duce Evidence of any Kind, that the Friends of an American Epi&s;copate acted deceitfully, and to lay before the Public his pretended <HI>Secrets</HI>; but in his <HI>Reply,</HI> he very &s;agaciou&s;ly takes Care to &s;ay no|thing at all of the Matter: And, con&s;idering his Di&s;po&s;ition and Situation as a Di&s;putant, it is from thence as certain as any Demon&s;tration in <HI>Euclid,</HI> that he could &s;ay nothing to the Purpo&s;e. And here it may be proper to repeat, what was &s;aid re|lating to this Objection, in my former <HI>Defence.</HI> p. 265.
<Q>Important as it is, it has nothing more &s;o|lid to depend upon than malevolent Conjecture; for whatever may be their (our Opponents) Pre|tences, every Reader knows that they have hi|therto intirely failed in the Article of <HI>Proof.</HI> On our Side, the &s;tronge&s;t Evidence that the Nature of &s;uch a Ca&s;e will admit of, has been laid be|fore the Public. We have produced, as Wit|ne&s;&s;es, the Society's anniver&s;ary Sermons, their
<PB N="237" REF="012007_0244_0F89414E52484088">
Ab&s;tracts, and indeed all that has been publi&s;h|ed on the Subject, by &s;uch as could be &s;uppo&s;ed to under&s;tand the Ca&s;e, for half a Century pa&s;t; all which, without one Exception, te&s;tify in our Favor. We have added our &s;olemn Declarati|ons, which mu&s;t have a Weight proportionable to what is allowed to our Characters. The Te&s;|timony of our Vouchers is clear and expre&s;s, uniform and con&s;i&s;tent, and directly to the Point; while not one counter Evidence has appeared, on the other Side, to weaken it. To the Weight of our Declarations nothing has been oppo&s;ed, but ungenerous Reflections and pretended Su&s;|picions.</Q></P>
<P>IT has al&s;o been contended, that in Ca&s;e the pre&s;ent Plan &s;hould at fir&s;t be actually put in Exe|cution; yet the Danger is great, that, in Time, it may degenerate into an Epi&s;copate that is bur|then&s;ome and oppre&s;&s;ive. But nothing has been &s;aid, that proves more than the <HI>Po&s;&s;ibility</HI> of this, and which might not as fairly be objected again&s;t the mo&s;t harmle&s;s or u&s;eful In&s;titution, that was ever propo&s;ed. If it could be made <HI>probable</HI> that &s;uch an Alteration would en&s;ue, as would be inju|rious to others; we would give up the Pro&s;ecution of our general De&s;ign. For we mean nothing that is unfriendly to any human Creature:&mdash;We de&s;ire nothing more for our&s;elves than that harmle&s;s Li|berty, which we wi&s;h all others to enjoy, and which all the other Prote&s;tant Subjects, and many Popi&s;h ones, of the Briti&s;h Empire, actually do enjoy. But
<Q>we &s;ee not the lea&s;t Probability of this (progno&s;ticated Alteration) and we ab&s;olutely deny that any &s;uch Thing is intended: So far from it, that the Friends of the Church would even join with its Enemies, were that nece&s;&s;ary,
<PB N="238" REF="012007_0245_0F89414EECA7E280">
in guarding again&s;t it. All the A&s;&s;urances, all the Evidences, all the Securities, which we have in our Power to give to prevent Unea&s;ine&s;s, we are wil|ling to offer; and all that is not beneath the Dig|nity of Government to give, we are willing to &s;ol|icit. We want not an Epi&s;copate on the Footing of a <HI>State-E&s;tabli&s;hment</HI>; we de&s;ire no more than a compleat Toleration, which we have not at pre|&s;ent; and thereby to be rai&s;ed to an Equality with other religious Denominations in the Colonies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Appeal defended,</HI> p. 266.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>UNDER the&s;e &s;everal Heads, all the Objections that have been offered directly again&s;t the Epi&s;co|pate in Di&s;pute, may be fairly reduced. The Church of England, and the Society for the Pro|pagation of the Go&s;pel, have been violently forced into this Controver&s;y, and <HI>violently</HI> treated; but every Thing that has been &s;aid again&s;t either one or the other, in Ca&s;e it could have been &s;uppor|ted, has no more than an oblique and remote Relation to the Bi&s;hops in Que&s;tion. All the Objections of this Kind, that have not been given up, have been brought before the Public in the pre&s;ent <HI>Defence,</HI> and mo&s;tly in the Words of my Opponent, and di&s;tinct An&s;wers have been given; &s;o that what real Strength they contain, the Reader is now able to judge.</P>
<P>AND here I beg Leave to ob&s;erve, that, whatever may have been attempted in Oppo&s;ition to our <HI>Plan,</HI> nothing that is plau&s;ible has been offered, and but little has been attempted again&s;t our Plea for an Epi&s;copate of <HI>&s;ome</HI> Kind. It has not been &s;hewn, nor can it be &s;hewn, that going to England for Ordination is not as expen&s;ive, and has not been productive of as many Deaths, as was urged in the
<PB N="239" REF="012007_0246_0F89414FB20F6E00">
<HI>Appeal.</HI> It has not been &s;hewn, nor can it be &s;hewn, that &s;uch a Burthen and &s;uch Lo&s;&s;es are not Grievances, which all other Denominations of Chri&s;tians in the Colonies, were it their own Ca&s;e, would think intolerable. It has not been &s;hewn, nor can it be &s;hewn, that the Epi&s;copalians in America &s;hould everla&s;tingly be doomed to bear Burthens, from which all others are exempted. In a Word, it has not been &s;hewn, nor can it be &s;hewn, that they ought not to be admitted to an equal Enjoyment of religious Privileges with other Chri&s;tians, although many of tho&s;e Privileges are in&s;eparable from an Epi&s;copate.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, it wants not to be &s;hewn, that they have never done any Thing, whereby the common Rights of Chri&s;tians are forfeited. Their general Principles and Conduct are &s;uch, and have been &s;uch, with Regard to the Public, as can ju&s;tly occa&s;ion no Di&s;tinction to their Di&s;advantage. They are, at lea&s;t, as friendly to Liberty, both civil and religious, as any of their Oppo&s;ers. They are 'equal to the foremo&s;t,' in Loyalty to the King, and Submi&s;&s;ion to the Government.</P>
<P>AND while their Preten&s;ions and Claims are as fair, in all Re&s;pects, as tho&s;e of their Neigh|bours, there are &s;ome Circum&s;tances in their Fa|vour, which, in Addition to their common Right, render it impo&s;&s;ible, in their Opinion, that they &s;hould be finally di&s;appointed. They con&s;ider them&s;elves as Members of that Church, the Con|&s;titution of which peculiarly harmoni&s;es with the civil Government of the Nation, and which is therefore intitled to the peculiar Affection of Go|vernment. They con&s;ider our gracious Sovereign as their Defender and Patron, by Duty as well as
<PB N="240" REF="012007_0247_0F8941506C65DC28">
by Inclination. They con&s;ider that the Nation in general has given to the Religion they profe&s;s, pe|culiar Proofs of E&s;teem and Preference at home; and therefore cannot con&s;i&s;tently treat it wor&s;e than all other Religions abroad. And they con&s;ider, that there never was an In&s;tance, in any Age of the World, or any Nation on Earth, in which &s;uch a rea&s;onable and moderate Reque&s;t would have been refu&s;ed, to &s;uch a Body of People, in &s;uch a Situation, and in &s;uch a Relation to the national E&s;tabli&s;hment.</P>
<P>THEY cannot therefore but flatter them&s;elves, that, notwith&s;tanding the unrea&s;onable and malici|ous Oppo&s;ition they have met with, an Epi&s;copate will be granted them on the Plan that is propo&s;ed, which they think much the fite&s;t for this Coun|try; and that, &s;o far as the Interpo&s;ition of Government may be requi&s;ite, it will not be refu&s;ed. If any di&s;tingui&s;hing Favours were reque&s;ted, if any Dominion or Superiority over others were aimed at, it would intirely alter the Ca&s;e. But, as was &s;aid in the <HI>Appeal</HI>:
<Q>The Church of England in America&mdash;<HI>only</HI> reque&s;ts, that proper Remedies may be provided for her pre&s;ent Sufferings.&mdash; She wi&s;hes for nothing, which &s;hall be thought incon&s;i&s;tent with the Rights and Safety of others. She a&s;ks nothing but what has been granted to others, without any ill Con&s;equences; and &s;he relies on the common Affection and Ju&s;tice of the Nation, to rai&s;e her to this Equality. And whether there be any Thing pre&s;umptuous or unrea&s;onable in the&s;e Expectations, let Heaven and Earth judge!</Q></P>
