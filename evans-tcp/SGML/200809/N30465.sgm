<P>MY friends, at a &s;olemn marriage-&s;upper there is u&s;ually a friendly company who meet together; and when, at &s;uch an occa&s;ion, all things are managed with &s;obriety and decency, it is very joyful and plea&s;ant to the parties concerned, to &s;ee the members of the meeting, with mutual kindne&s;s to one another, harmoniou&s;ly gracing the &s;olemnity: Even &s;o <HI>at the marriage-&s;upper of the lamb,</HI> I mean, the &s;acrament of the Lord's Supper, which we have been celebrating, there is a joyful company, not of men and women, for that would make but a poor earthly meeting; not yet of &s;aints and angels, for that would make but at be&s;t a mean creature-meeting; but it is a glorious delightful company of divine attributes and perfections, in the &s;weete&s;t concord meeting together, and embracing one another. This wonderful conjunction of divine excellencies is the friendly company that meets to|gether, to put honour upon this nuptial &s;olemnity; and to &s;ee them thus harmoniou&s;ly embracing one another in the

&s;alvation of &s;inners, <HI>is the &s;weete&s;t &s;ight that the bride, the lamb's wife, &s;hall ever &s;ee at the marriage-&s;upper,</HI> whether it be at the lower or upper table. There is a great meeting in <HI>this hou&s;e,</HI> but an infinitely greater in this <HI>text</HI>; a meet|ing of divine excellencies, to grace the &s;olemnity of the mar|riage-&s;upper of the lamb: <HI>Mercy and truth are met together, righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace have ki&s;&s;ed each other.</HI> When God made heaven and earth out of nothing, he made them by a word, without any other ceremony; but, when he made man, there was &s;ome particular &s;olemnity, a grand council, as it were, of the glorious Trinity called; <HI>Come, let us make man after our image.</HI> But now man having unmade him&s;elf, if God hath a mind for the prai&s;e of his own glorious grace to make him up again, <HI>by a new creation in Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</HI> there mu&s;t be a more glorious &s;olemnity yet; not only a council of the adorable Trinity, but a grand meeting of all the at|tributes of God, to con&s;ult their own glory that was marr'd, and reconcile their own intere&s;ts, and &s;eemingly contradic|tory claims: For the &s;in of man had brought real confu&s;ion among all the creatures of God on earth, yea, and &s;eeming war among all the attributes of God in heaven, concerning the execution of the &s;entence of the law upon mankind, the tran&s;gre&s;&s;or thereof; &s;ome of the&s;e attributes, &s;uch as <HI>Mercy,</HI> &s;aying, if the &s;entence of death be executed upon them, how &s;hall I be glorified? Others, &s;uch as <HI>Truth,</HI> &s;aying, if the &s;entence be not executed, how &s;hall I be glorified? Is it to be expected that &s;uch oppo&s;ites can meet together? Or, if they meet, that they will agree together cordially? Yea, tho' it be beyond the expectation of men and angels, yet behold, it is here celebrated with a &s;ong? <HI>Mercy and truth are met together, righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace have ki&s;&s;ed each other.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>P&s;alm</HI> con&s;i&s;ts of a <HI>prayer of faith,</HI> and an <HI>an&s;wer of peace.</HI> 1&s;t, The Church's <HI>prayer,</HI> from the beginning to the 8th v. where they are praying for the removal of many tokens of God's di&s;plea&s;ure they were under, notwith&s;tand|ing
<PB N="5" REF="040455_0004_101645CEA6582980">
their return out of the <HI>Babyloni&s;h</HI> captivity. 2<HI>dly,</HI> The <HI>an&s;wer of peace</HI> that is made to their prayer, from v. 8. and downward. We have here the p&s;almi&s;t li&s;tning and waiting for the an&s;wer; <HI>I will hear what God the Lord will &s;peak</HI>; the an&s;wer it&s;elf in general is peace, <HI>He will &s;peak peace to his people,</HI> &amp;c. If he give not outward peace, yet he will &s;ug|ge&s;t inward peace, &s;peaking that to their hearts by his Spirit, which he had &s;poken to their ears by his word. Whatever other &s;ort of peace and pro&s;perity they enjoyed, when at length the children of the captivity, after a great deal of toil, had gained a &s;ettlement in their own land, yet peace with God, and &s;piritual pro&s;perity under the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah's</HI> king|dom, was the great thing here promi&s;ed, and prophe&s;ied of; and that is a peace that lays the &s;oul under the &s;tronge&s;t ob|ligation to keep at a di&s;tance from all &s;in, which is the greate&s;t folly, and to beware of back&s;liding thereto. <HI>But let them not return again to folly:</HI> For true peace with God brings in war with &s;in. But this is further explained in the main leading part thereof, namely, <HI>&s;alvation</HI> and <HI>glory,</HI> ver. 9. <HI>Surely his &s;alvation is near to them that fear him, that glory may dwell in our land.</HI> Now, whatever other &s;alvation be here imported, Chri&s;t is the great &s;alvation intended. When he is near in view, then the believer cries out, with old <HI>Simeon, Now mine eyes have &s;een thy &s;alvation</HI>: And, whatever other glory and honour be here imported Chri&s;t is the chief glory here intended: When he goes away from a land, then <HI>Ichabod, the glory is departed</HI>; but, <HI>where he abides, glory dwells</HI>: for he is called, <HI>A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of his people</HI> I&s;rael. But now, if we would know what &s;ort of glory it is that appears when Chri&s;t is revealed, why it is even the glorious harmony of all the divine attributes illu&s;triou&s;ly &s;hining in him, who is both <HI>our &s;alvation</HI> and <HI>our glory; Mercy and truth are met together; righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace have ki&s;&s;ed each other.</HI> Now, tho' the&s;e words may be applied to the happy meeting of graces in men, upon the revelation of
<PB N="6" REF="040455_0005_101645D3C0FB01D0">
Chri&s;t in the &s;oul, which I may afterwards ob&s;erve in the &s;equel, and in which &s;en&s;e &s;ome interpreters under&s;tand it&punc; yet I take it mainly to import <HI>the happy meeting of perfections in God to be glorified in the &s;inner's &s;alvation by Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> which is a glo&s;s that no interpreter I have had occa&s;ion to con&s;ult does neglect or omit; and, if any of them &s;hould mi&s;s it, I think they would mi&s;s the very ground-work and founda|tion of all other happy meetings: <HI>Mercy and truth are met together, righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace have ki&s;&s;ed each other.</HI></P>
<P>In the words you may ob&s;erve, 1<HI>&s;t,</HI> The <HI>members</HI> of the meeting. 2<HI>dly,</HI> the <HI>manner</HI> of the meeting. 3<HI>dly,</HI> the <HI>har|mony</HI> of the meeting. 4<HI>thly,</HI> The <HI>&s;trangene&s;s</HI> of it.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erve, I &s;ay, 1. The <HI>members</HI> of the meeting, <HI>mercy, truth, righteou&s;ne&s;s, peace.</HI> I hope I need not caution &s;ome in this a&s;&s;embly that they beware of imagining the&s;e various perfections of God, under the names of <HI>mercy, truth, righte|ou&s;ne&s;s</HI> and <HI>peace,</HI> as if they were really di&s;tinct and different things in God; or, as if they were really different parties, making a formal con&s;ultation, in order, to their agreement; <HI>For God is one,</HI> and cannot be divided; <HI>he is one infinite, eternal and unchangeable Being</HI>; there are not di&s;tinct and different things in his nature and e&s;&s;ence, however his per|fections be thus repre&s;ented to our weak, finite capacities, which cannot under&s;tand the perfections of God but in &s;everal parts, as it were. By <HI>mercy</HI> then, here, we are to un|der&s;tand God him&s;elf, as he is a <HI>merciful and a gracious God:</HI> By <HI>truth</HI> we are to under&s;tand <HI>the &s;ame God,</HI> as he is a <HI>true and faithful God:</HI> By <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> we may under&s;tand his <HI>ju&s;tice,</HI> or God him&s;elf, as he is a <HI>ju&s;t and righteous God</HI>; and, by <HI>peace,</HI> the &s;ame God, as he is the <HI>God of peace,</HI> and a <HI>God reconciling the world to him&s;elf.</HI> So that the whole comes to this; it is the great and eternal God him&s;elf, con&s;ulting with him&s;elf, in a manner becom|ing his infinite and adorable perfections, how to glorify him|&s;elf in all his glorious attributes in the way of &s;aving &s;inners in and by Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="7" REF="040455_0006_101645D554286680">2. The <HI>manner</HI> of the meeting. The&s;e excellencies and perfections of God meet together, as it were, in pairs; <HI>mercy and truth, righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace,</HI> going hand in hand into the council-chamber, to concert the matters that concerned their highe&s;t glory and honour.</P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>harmony</HI> of the meeting. Having met together, they <HI>ki&s;s and embrace each other. Mercy and peace,</HI> as it were, ex|pre&s;s their complacency in <HI>truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> and <HI>truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> expre&s;s their complacency in <HI>mercy and peace,</HI> and delight in one another's honour: For not one attribute of the divine maje&s;ty can or will be glorified to the di&s;hon<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> or any other attribute, but mutually embrace each other <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the their everla&s;ting arms, for &s;upporting the honour of each <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">|ther's excellency with complicated ineffable endearment.</P>
<P N="4">4. The <HI>&s;trangene&s;s</HI> and remarkablene&s;s of this meeting? For the agreement of the&s;e parties met together is the more remarkable, in regard of their jarring and oppo&s;ite claims: For that <HI>mercy and peace &s;hall meet together,</HI> and agree in fa|vour to &s;ave us, and that <HI>truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> &s;hould meet together, and agree in ju&s;tice to de&s;troy us, were not &s;o &s;trange and remarkable. And, if they had kept &s;eparate and remain'd &s;o, man had been for ever &s;eparate from God, and &s;ome darling attributes had never been glorified in man's &s;alvation, our &s;in and rebellion having in a manner &s;et the attributes of God at &s;uch variance, as nothing el&s;e than in|finite wi&s;dom could provide a &s;ufficient an&s;wer to all their contradictory claims and intere&s;ts, which behoved to be done ere the propo&s;al concerning the &s;alvation of any &s;inner could be gone into. Why, &s;ays <HI>mercy,</HI> it is my intere&s;t that the &s;inner live and not peri&s;h, that I may be magnified, &s;ince I have &s;aid, that <HI>I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy.</HI> Well, but, &s;ays <HI>truth,</HI> it is my intere&s;t as a God of truth that the &s;inner die, &s;ince I have &s;aid, that <HI>the &s;oul that &s;inneth &s;hall die.</HI> Yea, and &s;ays <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> I mu&s;t join with <HI>truth,</HI> and claim the &s;inner's damnation for the advancement of my

intere&s;t and honour; for I have &s;aid, and will not gain &s;ay it, that I <HI>will by no means clear the guilty.</HI> O but, &s;ays <HI>peace.</HI> I mu&s;t join in with <HI>mercy,</HI> and claim the &s;inner's &s;alvation, for advancing my intere&s;t; for I <HI>create the fruit of the lips, peace, peace to him that is afar off, and to him that is near.</HI> So there appears to be a war in heaven among the&s;e infinitely adora|ble attributes and perfections, while <HI>mercy and peace</HI> are &s;ay|ing, we mu&s;t have glory in &s;hewing unde&s;erved pity on the &s;inner, and yet <HI>truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> are &s;aying, we mu&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ve glory in executing the de&s;erved vengeance. And now, men and angels! pray tell us, can the&s;e <HI>antipodes</HI> meet <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters">ther? Can the&s;e jarring-like attributes of the divine maje&s;ty embrace each other in the &s;alvation of the &s;inner, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> as to get all their demands an&s;wered, and their different intere&s;ts advanced? What &s;ay you, children of men, can you devi&s;e how the&s;e differences can be compo&s;ed for your own &s;afety? No, no; <HI>human</HI> Wi&s;dom &s;ays, <HI>It is not in me.</HI> What &s;ay ye, angels, that <HI>excel</HI> in <HI>&s;trength</HI> and wi&s;dom? Can you contrive the reconciliation of the&s;e irreconcileable demands? No, no; <HI>angelical</HI> wi&s;dom &s;ays, <HI>It is not in me.</HI> Well, &s;ince creature wi&s;dom fails, may we addre&s;s the infi|nite wi&s;dom of the Deity, and enquire at a higher hand? <HI>Be|hold, now we have taken upon us to &s;peak unto the Lord, who are but du&s;t and a&s;hes</HI>: What &s;ay&s;t thou, O infinitely wi&s;e Jehovah? Can the&s;e oppo&s;ite claims be reconciled, to the &s;atisfaction of all parties, and the &s;alvation of the &s;inner? Yea, it is done, <HI>it is done in a crucified Chri&s;t,</HI> whom we have been remembring at this &s;olemnity; and therefore we may &s;ing this marvellous &s;ong upon an after review of it, &s;aying, <HI>Glory, glory, glory to God, that mercy and truth are met to|gether,</HI> &amp;c.</P>

<P>When God is well plea&s;ed, no perfection of God is di&s;|plea&s;ed; <HI>but God is well plea&s;ed in Chri&s;t</HI>: And therefore every perfection of his nature is well plea&s;ed, none of them di&s;plea&s;ed or di&s;&s;atisfied, but all plea&s;ed and &s;atisfied to the full. See <HI>Ho&s;.</HI> 2.19, 20. This is declared by an audible voice from heaven, &s;aying, <HI>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well plea&s;ed,</HI> Mat. 3. la&s;t. And why? Even for the rea&s;on you have, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 42.21. We &s;ee <HI>he hath brought in a righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> an&s;wering the demands of all that &s;tood in the way of our &s;alvation: Did divine <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> &s;ay, that the threatning of the law mu&s;t be executed, &s;o &s;ure as God is true, as well as its precept obtemperated and obeyed? Well, can a righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;atisfying both the&s;e demands, do the bu&s;ine&s;s? Yea, &s;ays <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> it&s;elf, in concert with <HI>mercy,</HI> if there be but one righteous man in the <HI>Sodom</HI> of this earth, that can &s;atisfy my broken and violated law, in its command of perfect obedience, and in its demand of complete &s;atisfac|tion; then I will &s;pare all the elect world, for the &s;ake of that one righteous man, and, <HI>By his knowledge &s;hall my righ|teous &s;ervant ju&s;tify many.</HI> Well, &s;ays <HI>mercy,</HI> here is one who&s;e name is <HI>wonderful,</HI> and whom they call <HI>Immanuel,</HI> God-man, who hath <HI>brought in an everla&s;ting righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> both active and pa&s;&s;ive, &s;uiting the precept and penalty of the law: Why then, might one attribute &s;ay to another, we are all plea&s;ed, and with one con&s;ent let it be proclaimed on earth, that <HI>the Lord is well plea&s;ed for his righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;ake; for he hath magnified the law, and made it honourable.</HI> And now the great affair of man's &s;alvation is &s;o well concerted and contrived, that God may have mercy upon them, and be at peace with poor &s;inners, without any wrong to his truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s: The attributes of God have met and agreed, and &s;ealed their agreement with a ki&s;s of infinite

<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I would &s;peak a little of the <HI>members</HI> of this meeting, or the attributes of God that thus harmoniou&s;ly con&s;pire to|gether. We need not a&s;k, at who&s;e <HI>in&s;tance</HI> this meeting is called? It is at the in&s;tant, and by the order of JEHOVAH, Father, Son, and Holy Gho&s;t, one God; his &s;overeign will and plea&s;ure re&s;olving, in a manner like him&s;elf, to concert with him&s;elf. Neither need we a&s;k, what is <HI>the occa&s;ion</HI> of the meeting? Why, man had &s;inned, and all mankind, by their &s;in, was involved under the cur&s;e of the law, and wrath of God; and yet God had re&s;olved and decreed, for the glory of his grace and mercy, to &s;ave a world of &s;inners, <HI>elect ac|cording to the foreknowledge of God.</HI> And while <HI>grace mercy</HI> and <HI>peace</HI> are upon this loving de&s;ign of &s;aving &s;inners, it was fit that <HI>ju&s;tice, truth</HI> and <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> &s;hould be called into the &s;ame council, to appear for their intere&s;t; &s;ince the propo&s;al of &s;uch a &s;alvation of &s;inners &s;eem to encroach upon their honour, which required the vengeance due to be executed upon the <HI>&s;inner.</HI> Well, the meeting being called, the&s;e glorious perfections, <HI>mercy, truth, righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> and <HI>peace</HI> ap|pear; <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>peace</HI> full of pity, <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> full of fury, which made a &s;eeming controver&s;y in heaven.

<Q>O thou infinitely righteous and ju&s;t judge, MERCY can have no hearing in this court to the prejudice of thy honour and glory, as a ju&s;t and righteous God.

Well, PEACE being allowed a hearing, propo&s;es a healing overture &s;aying,
<Q>O thou God of peace, may not an atonement be made, a reconciliation thought of betwixt thy Maje&s;ty and and thy creature?

May not one be found out that will make up the breach, by vindicating the honour of TRUTH and &s;atisfying the demands of JUSTICE, and &s;o making way for the claim of MERCY; and then all differences may be peaceably compo&s;ed, &s;o as we may harmoniou&s;ly agree and ki&s;s one another? O! may not then a peace|maker be found out, in whom we may find all our demands &s;atisfied at once, without prejudging one another; why, if &s;uch an one can be found, &s;urely his name &s;hall be called wonderfull, coun&s;ellor, the prince of peace.</Q>

all parties hearkned, as it were, with plea&s;ure, and willingly &s;ub&s;cribed to the happy overture; and then heaven and earth con&s;pired together in &s;olemn thank&s;giving, &s;aying, <HI>Glory to God in the highe&s;t, on earth peace, and good will to|wards men.</HI> Thus the jarring attributes of God are now re|conciled; and behold, the members of the meeting, that &s;eemed to be at the greate&s;t variance, are embracing one a|nother in their Arms; <HI>Mercy and truth are met together,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The <HI>&s;econd</HI> thing was, <HI>when</HI> and <HI>where</HI> did the&s;e ble&s;&s;ed parties meet together? When we &s;peak of a remarkable meeting, it is u&s;ual to enquire into the time and place of the meeting. Now, the <HI>place</HI> where, and the <HI>time</HI> when, as to this wonderful meeting, are two que&s;tions, which I put to|gether; for they may both be an&s;wered at once, becau&s;e of their near relation.</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>&s;t.</HI> Then, in general, the <HI>meeting-place,</HI> or the place of meeting, is CHRIST; and the time of the meeting was when Chri&s;t put him&s;elf in our room, or &s;ub&s;titute him&s;elf in the place of the &s;inner, to an&s;wer all the demands of all the mem|bers of the meeting, who had any objection again&s;t our &s;al|vation, or any thing to lay to our charge. Where then, and when did they <HI>meet together and ki&s;s each other</HI>? Why, it was even in Chri&s;t, when he took our law-room, to pay our debt, and purcha&s;e our liberty in &s;uch a manner as <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>peace</HI> might have their intere&s;ts advanced, without injury to <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI>; that <HI>mercy</HI> might have vent to the credit of <HI>truth,</HI> and <HI>peace</HI> might be proclaimed to the ho|nour of <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> and the &s;inner &s;aved to the &s;atisfaction of <HI>ju&s;tice.</HI> They meet together and embrace each other in him as the &s;urety, <HI>the &s;urety of the better te&s;tament,</HI> Heb. 7.22. We were <HI>debtors</HI> to the mandatory and minatory part of the law, arraigned at the in&s;tance of divine <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> to pay the debt; Chri&s;t &s;ub&s;titutes him&s;elf in our room, and comes un|der the law to pay the whole debt. It is true, the debt was per&s;onal, and <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> had a demand upon the per&s;on that &s;in|ned
<PB N="16" REF="040455_0015_101645EC5AA78450">
by virtue of the covenant of works; but that covenant never excluded a &s;urety, tho' it provided none. The law promi&s;ed life, upon our per&s;onal obedience; but, in ca&s;e we fail, it revealed no &s;urety to make out an obedience in our room. There behoved indeed to be a &s;ecret re&s;erve in the covenant of works, whereby the perfect obedience of another was not excluded: For, if the covenant of works had ab&s;o|lutely excluded a &s;urety in our room, then the covenant of grace had been excluded, and our &s;alvation had been impo&s;|&s;ible after our fall; but tho' the covenant of works did not exclude a &s;urety, yet that covenant did neither provide nor reveal a &s;urety: This is done in the covenant of grace, which is Chri&s;t as &s;urety fulfilling for us the covenant of works, in all the articles of it. Now, is truth and faithfulne&s;s at any lo&s;s here? No, the truth of the promi&s;e &amp; threatning both of the law of works, is fulfilled. On the one hand, the promi&s;e of eternal life made to perfect obedience; which, tho' we forfeited in our own per&s;on, yet we recover in the per&s;on of Chri&s;t; the promi&s;e of life upon the ground and condition of perfect obedience being fulfilled to us in him, who hath yielded that perfect obedience in our room: On the other hand, divine <HI>truth</HI> and faithfulne&s;s, in the threatning of the law, which was death, is glorified, in that it is fulfilled upon the &s;urety; while we, who came under the &s;entence of death in the fir&s;t <HI>Adam,</HI> undergo that death in the &s;econd. Again, is <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> and <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> at any lo&s;s by this &s;urety in our room? No, no; whether we look upon it as vindictive or retributive ju&s;tice, vindictive ju&s;tice is di&s;played in its utmo&s;t &s;everity upon Chri&s;t; <HI>Awake, O &s;word, again&s;t my &s;hepherd, and the man that is my fellow</HI>: And &s;o the &s;word is drunk in his blood to infinite &s;atisfaction. Retributive ju&s;tice is glori|ou&s;ly di&s;played al&s;o, in the &s;inner's being rewarded, ju&s;tified, &s;aved upon this ground. It is true, might JUSTICE &s;ay,
<Q>I could have demanded &s;atisfaction upon the &s;inner him&s;elf in his own per&s;on; but, as I can &s;u&s;tain no injury to my

honour by &s;uch a &s;urety as this, whom they call EMMANUEL' God-man, &s;o I find my honour &amp; intere&s;t, in&s;tead of being impaired, is advanced by this exchange of per&s;ons: For, tho' I &s;hould damn the &s;inner to all eternity, I'll never get &s;uch full and compleat &s;atisfaction upon any finite crea|ture, as I will get by one &s;troke of my avenging &s;word upon that per&s;on of infinite dignity; and &s;o it plea&s;ed the Lord to brui&s;e him.</Q>
Why then, they meet together and em|brace one another in him, as a &s;urety; and, if <HI>truth</HI> &amp; <HI>righte|teou&s;ne&s;s</HI> be both plea&s;ed to the full, the parties cannot but all agree &amp; embrace each other. Again they meet together and embrace one another in him, as a &s;acrifice <HI>a &s;acrifice &amp; offering of a &s;weet-&s;melling favour unto God,</HI> Eph. 5.2. Why <HI>he offered up him&s;elf by the eternal Spirit.</HI> O great! Even by his eternal Godhead; a valuable &s;acrifice indeed! They meet together in him, as a propitiation, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.25. <HI>Whom God hath &s;et forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> &amp;c. Behold him righteous in &s;hewing mercy; here is the atonement, the propitiation, that very word which the <HI>&s;eptuagint</HI> calls the <HI>mercy-&s;eat</HI> in the old te&s;tament; and it is the word that the poor publican made u&s;e of, when he was &s;eeking mercy, &s;aying, <HI>God be merciful to me a &s;inner.</HI> He remembred this mercy-&s;eat and propitiation. It is not &s;im|ple mercy that he &s;ought, but mercy through a propitiation; he looked to the blood of atonement, to the &s;acrificed lamb of God, &s;aying, Give me mercy for this; by that &s;olemn pro|pitiation be thou propitious to me. Here it is, that <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> meet together. They meet together in him, as a ran&s;om, <HI>Job</HI> 33.24. <HI>Deliver his &s;oul from going down to the pit; I have found a ran&s;om.</HI> In a word they have met toge|ther, and ki&s;&s;ed one another in a crucified Chri&s;t, who&s;e death was the payment of our debt, the puni&s;hment of our &s;in, the price of our redemption, and a purcha&s;e of our life, liberty and eternal &s;alvation. Here is the meeting-place then of the&s;e glorious perfections of God; here is the per&s;on in whom

they centre, that they may be all glorified to the highe&s;t: <HI>Mercy, truth, righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> and <HI>peace,</HI> all are plea&s;ed. <HI>Mercy</HI> is gra|tified, and con&s;titutes him to be the mercy-&s;eat; <HI>truth</HI> is &s;a|tisfied, and centers in him as the <HI>way, the truth and the life; righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> is contented, and declares him to be the <HI>Lord our righteou&s;ne&s;s; peace</HI> is pacified, &amp; proclaims him to be the <HI>prince of peace.</HI> Yea, not only are all the members of the meet|ing plea&s;ed and &s;atisfied for them&s;elves, in the advancement of their own particular intere&s;t, but they are infinitely well plea&s;ed in each other, and that the intere&s;ts of their &s;eemingly oppo&s;ite parties are advanced, as well as their own par|ticular claims: <HI>Mercy</HI> is plea&s;ed that truth hath got all its de|mands, and truth is plea&s;ed that <HI>mercy</HI> hath got all her de&s;ire, and <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> is plea&s;ed that peace is proclaimed, and peace is plea&s;ed that <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> is honoured. <HI>Mercy</HI> and <HI>peace</HI> rejoice that they are magnified to the infinite glory of <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> and <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> rejoice that they are glorified to the infinite plea&s;ure of <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>peace</HI>: and hence they not only meet together, but ki&s;s one another.

<P N="2">2<HI>dly,</HI> More particularly, as to the <HI>meeting-time,</HI> you may take the&s;e <HI>following paticulars</HI> for the further clearing of it. Altho' this <HI>ble&s;&s;ed meeting</HI> once taking place is &s;till continued, and cannot be &s;aid properly to adjourn from <HI>time</HI> to <HI>time,</HI> and from <HI>place</HI> to <HI>place</HI>; for this a&s;&s;embly never di&s;&s;olves: Yet, in a &s;uitablene&s;s to our weak capacity and finite under|&s;tanding, which cannot rightly conceive of a meeting that never had a time to meet, becau&s;e they met in eternity, and never &s;hall have a time to part, becau&s;e they meet to eter|nity; we cannot conceive of it, I &s;ay, but by taking it, as it were, into &s;o many parts, or con&s;idering it in &s;o many peri|ods: And there are the&s;e eight remarkable periods: where|in <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>peace</HI> meet with <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> and ki&s;s each other.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="19" REF="040455_0018_101645F4C91B7B60">1. The fir&s;t remarkable period is this, they meet together at the council-table of the <HI>covenant of redemption</HI> from all eternity, before ever the foundation of the world was laid; and ere ever the morning-&s;tars &s;ang together, <HI>mercy and truth met together, righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace ki&s;&s;ed each other</HI>: For the council of peace did then meet, <HI>Zech.</HI> 6.13. and all was con|certed by infinite wi&s;dom, how <HI>mercy</HI> &s;hould be magnified, <HI>truth</HI> cleared, <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> vindicated, &amp; <HI>peace</HI> concluded, and all in Chri&s;t, who according to the tenor of that covenant (whereof the covenant of grace is but a tran&s;cript) was to give <HI>his &s;oul an offering for &s;in,</HI> &amp; then was to <HI>&s;et his &s;eed,</HI> &amp; <HI>the plea&s;ure of the Lord</HI> to <HI>pro&s;per in his hand.</HI> Then it was that this plea&s;ant meeting in him was fir&s;t con&s;tituted, as you may &s;ee, <HI>Prov.</HI> 8.30.31. <HI>He</HI> being <HI>&s;et up from everla&s;ting; ere ever the earth was,</HI> God in all his glorious perfections was delighted in him, and in him his <HI>delights were with the &s;ons of men.</HI> This was the grand meeting, at which the time and place of all the &s;ub&s;equent meetings were concerted, and all the other par|ticulars we are to mention are but the re&s;ult of this, and as it were emanations therefrom, for it is a meeting that ne|ver di&s;&s;olves, tho' in &s;everal periods it appears like a new meeting unto us.

<P N="2">2. Another remarkable period is their meeting together in the garden of <HI>Eden,</HI> after man had made him&s;elf naked and obnoxious to the flaming &s;word of divine ju&s;tice. Mercy comes walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the guilty criminal being examined in open court, behold <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>truth</HI> meet together in the happy &s;entence that was pro|nounced, <HI>The &s;eed of the woman &s;hall brui&s;e the head of the &s;erpent,</HI> Gen. 3.15.

<P N="5">5. Another remarkable period is their meeting together in the garden of <HI>Geth&s;emane,</HI> when Chri&s;t, <HI>being in an agony, did &s;weat great drops of blood,</HI> under the pre&s;&s;ure of avenging ju&s;tice; every drop of blood was an ocean of mercy: And, while he was pre&s;t in the wine-pre&s;s of God's wrath, <HI>mercy</HI> was expre&s;t. No mercy to Chri&s;t; for <HI>God &s;pared not his own for,</HI> even when he cried, mercy, mercy, God's mercy; &s;aying, <HI>Father, if it be thy will remove this cup from me.</HI> No, no, no mercy was &s;hewn to him, otherwi&s;e no mercy had been &s;hown to us: Ju&s;tice mu&s;t have its due from him, that mer|cy might have vent towards us; and &s;o here <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>truth</HI> meet together.</P>
<P N="6">6. Another remarkable period is their meeting on mount <HI>Calvary,</HI> where Chri&s;t was crucified. It was upon the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t that <HI>mercy and truth meet together,</HI> that <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace ki&s;&s;ed each other</HI>; for there it was that he paid all the elect's debt to the la&s;t farthing that truth and righteou&s;|ne&s;s could demand, until <HI>he cried with a loud voice, and &s;aid, It is fini&s;hed.</HI> Having done all that the law could injoin, he &s;uffered all that the law could threaten, &s;o as it cannot crave a farthing more. It is fini&s;hed; all that was &s;tipulated for with the Father in that federal tran&s;action; all that was pro|mi&s;ed in that eternal compact is fini&s;hed; every article a|greed to in the coun&s;el of peace was fini&s;hed. The bargain that he had &s;igned with his hand, he now &s;ealed with his blood; and in his appearance upon the cro&s;s, or in his obe|dience to the death, did all the attributes of God meet, as in a centre: And on this account was mount <HI>Calvary</HI> more glorious than mount <HI>Sinai</HI>; for in mount <HI>Sinai</HI> God appeared
<PB N="21" REF="040455_0020_101645F858E72EE0">
in his terrible maje&s;ty, making the mountain to tremble, and the earth to &s;hake; but here in mount <HI>Calvary</HI> he appeared, not only in his terrible maje&s;ty, but in his tender mercy; in his terrible fury again&s;t &s;in, &amp; in his tender favour towards the &s;in|ner; &amp; now, the controver&s;y betwixt <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>mercy</HI> &s;eems at a cri&s;is.

Be|hold the living and eternal God here, in our nature, wounded to death and bleeding out his life, to be a &s;acrifice for &s;in, that ju&s;tice might be &s;atisfied, and mercy might be magni|fied, and all the attributes of God glorified to the highe&s;t. O wonder, that <HI>Golgotha,</HI> the place of a &s;cull, &s;hould be &s;uch a famous meeting-place for the divine perfections? It was a place of the greate&s;t &s;hame and ignominy; but in him <HI>who endured the cro&s;s, and de&s;pi&s;ed the &s;hame,</HI> it was made a place of mo&s;t re&s;plendent glory: For, in the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, <HI>mercy and truth, righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace met and embraced each other.</HI> God's attributes did harmoniou&s;ly join together, &s;o as the one does not blacken, but illu&s;trate the glory of the other, while they &s;hined gloriou&s;ly in the face of Chri&s;t crucified, as a beautiful and bright con&s;tellation; for he was <HI>&s;et forth to be a propitiation, to declare the righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> and ju&s;tice of God, together with his other glorious names.</P>

vail, whither the forerunner hath for us entred, even Je&s;us,</HI> Heb. 6. <HI>la&s;t.</HI> When Chri&s;t was upon the cro&s;s, <HI>the vail of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom,</HI> &amp; a way was made for entring into the holy of holies. And as the prie&s;ts under the law were not only to offer the &s;acrifice without the camp, but after that were to enter the holie&s;t of all, not with|out blood, but with the blood of the &s;acrifice, <HI>to &s;prinkle the mercy &s;eat,</HI> Lev. 16.14, 15. Even &s;o <HI>Chri&s;t, having offered him&s;elf a &s;acrifice, and &s;uffered without the gate,</HI> Heb. 13.12. <HI>He is entred into the holy place by his own Blood,</HI> Heb. 9.12. there to appear as our high prie&s;t, in the power and virtue of his blood, to make a full atonement, and &s;prinkle the mercy-&s;eat. Hence believers are &s;aid <HI>to be come to Je&s;us the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of &s;prinkling.</HI> And where is this? Even in heaven, as you &s;ee in the context, <HI>Heb.</HI> 12.23, 24. Now, in this work, Chri&s;t carried the price of his blood into the very pre&s;ence of God for us, <HI>Heb.</HI> 9.24. and paid it down before him; and, in this act, ju&s;tice hath its &s;atisfaction brought home; and, by this act, mercy and ju&s;tice actually are met: For hereby Chri&s;t &s;prinkled the very mer|cy-&s;eat with blood all over, both <HI>upon</HI> it, and <HI>before</HI> it, as the forecited <HI>Lev.</HI> 16. repre&s;ents: For the mercy-&s;eat of old &s;tood &s;o, that it could be &s;een but two ways, namely, upon it, and before it, as a table next to the wall; and &s;o this points out, that whatever way we look to mercy by faith, we may &s;ee mercy and blood mixt, mercy and ju&s;tice met together, and all &s;orts of mercy conveyed thro' the blood of Chri&s;t, top-mercies, and &s;ide-mercies, upper-mercies of a &s;piritual nature, and lower mercies of a temporal nature; for the mercy-&s;eat is &s;prinkled with the blood upon it, and be|fore it, and whatever way you look to it. The &s;acrifice was fini&s;hed on the cro&s;s, and all &s;acrifices fini&s;hed therein; but the blood of the &s;acrifice behoved al&s;o to be carried within the vail in order to the full atonement, that what was writ|ten in blood upon the cro&s;s, might be &s;ealed in the pre&s;ence

<P N="8">8. Another remarkable period is their meeting together at the bar of con&s;cience, God's lower court, on the day of actual reconciliation betwixt God and the &s;inner: For then, <HI>the blood of Chri&s;t, who through the eternal &s;pirit did offer him|&s;elf without &s;pot to God, doth purge the con&s;cience,</HI> Heb. 9.14. And <HI>the blood of &s;prinkling, wherewith the con&s;cience is purged from dead works to &s;erve the living God,</HI> doth put forth it's purgative power and virtue by a certain internal &s;peech; and what doth it &s;peak in the con&s;cience? <HI>It &s;peaks better things than the blood of</HI> Abel; that &s;peaks <HI>vengeance,</HI> but this &s;peaks <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>peace,</HI> in conjunction with <HI>truth, righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> and <HI>ju&s;tice</HI>: For, wherever ju&s;tice &s;atisfying blood cries for mercy and peace, there <HI>mercy and truth, righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace meet, and embrace each other.</HI> This blood is the cement whereby they are joined together. Before this blood be applied, the con&s;cience of the convinced &s;inner is all in a flame, like mount <HI>Sinai</HI>; thunder and lightning, and &s;moak and darkne&s;s, and fear of hell and vengeance, compa&s;&s;ing the &s;oul about, while it is arraigned at the in&s;tance of the fiery law, to pay the double debt to the mandatory &amp; minotary part of the law, that is, perfect obedience upon the pain of eternal death and damnation. The &s;inner finds him&s;elf lo&s;t and un|done for ever by this law: But then, whenever the blood of &s;prinkling comes in, and appears at the bar of con&s;cience, it &s;peaks better things; it is a better &s;peaker than the law: And what &s;ays it? Why, the language of it is, By your leave, O <HI>law,</HI> you have nothing to crave; for Chri&s;t the Son of God was arraigned at the in&s;tance of divine ju&s;tice, to pay
<PB N="24" REF="040455_0023_101646032F334080">
all this debt, becau&s;e he was this &s;inner's &s;urety and &s;ub&s;ti|tute; and he actually paid it, by obeying the command, and undergoing the penalty of the law: And for this I produce the ancient records of God; <HI>In the volume of</HI> his <HI>book it is written of</HI> Chri&s;t, that <HI>when &s;acrifice and offering would not, he &s;aid, Lo, I come, I delight to do thy will</HI>; and that <HI>the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all</HI>; That <HI>he was made a cur&s;e for us</HI>; yea, that <HI>he was made &s;in for us,</HI> even he <HI>who knew no &s;in, that we might become the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God in him:</HI> And therefore, O <HI>law,</HI> tho' thou ha&s;t <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>righ|teou&s;ne&s;s</HI> on thy &s;ide, yet <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> have met with <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>peace,</HI> and they have concerted matters, and agreed harmoniou&s;ly, and ki&s;s'd one another, in token of their full agreement in Chri&s;t; &s;o that in Chri&s;t all charges are an&s;wered, and thus in the believer's con&s;cience parties meet together.</P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>third</HI> thing propo&s;ed was <HI>how,</HI> and after what <HI>manner</HI> is it that they meet together, and ki&s;s each other? We are to conceive of it after the manner of God; for it is more than a meeting of &s;aints, it is more than a meeting of angels, it is a divine meeting of all the glorious attributes of God; And we may ob&s;erve the&s;e following qualities of it.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is a <HI>wonderful</HI> and <HI>my&s;terious</HI> meeting, it is above our comprehen&s;ion and conception; O how wonderful a meet|ing is this! The very <HI>name</HI> of the per&s;on, which is made the place of appointment, the meeting place, is called <HI>wonderful!</HI> I&s;a. 9.6. Becau&s;e the meeting is about us, <HI>his name is called</HI> Immanuel, <HI>God with us.</HI> O how my&s;terious is this meeting, <HI>Great is the my&s;tery of godline&s;s, God manife&s;ted in the fle&s;h,</HI> 1 Tim. 3.16. that is, all the attributes of God meeting to|gether, and harmoniou&s;ly embracing one another in the e|ternal Son of God, who hath a&s;&s;umed our nature into his own per&s;onality; this is the mo&s;t wonderful my&s;terious meet|ing that ever was in heaven or earth.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is a <HI>joyful</HI> meeting, they meet with infinite plea&s;ure
<PB N="25" REF="040455_0024_10164607619FFC88">
and &s;atisfaction in one another; <HI>Behold my &s;ervant, whom I uphold, mine elect, in whom my &s;oul delighteth,</HI> I&s;a. 42.1. As the perfections of God are glorified in Chri&s;t, &s;o they rejoice and are delighted in him: <HI>For</HI> Jehovah <HI>is well plea&s;ed for his righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;ake</HI>; and therefore <HI>the plea&s;ure of the Lord &s;hall pro&s;per in his hand,</HI> and <HI>he &s;hall &s;ee the travail of his &s;oul, and be &s;atisfied.</HI> Surely, if God hath his plea&s;ure, and Chri&s;t his &s;atisfaction, no attribute of the divine maje&s;ty, no member of the meeting is di&s;plea&s;ed or out of humour; no, no: <HI>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well plea&s;ed.</HI> My ju&s;tice is plea&s;ed, my mercy is plea&s;ed, and all my other attributes are plea&s;ed. O it is an exceeding plea&s;ant and joyful meeting! May all that hear me be well plea&s;ed to &s;ee it; no joyful meeting, but what hath a re&s;pect to this.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is a <HI>holy</HI> meeting. Some meetings among men, that are called joyful meetings, yet are very unholy and &s;inful meetings; but here is an infinitely holy meeting: <HI>Holine&s;s to the Lord,</HI> is the motto of it. A meeting of holy &s;aints and holy angels is not &s;uch a holy meeting as this meeting of the holy attributes of God, to advance the great de&s;ign of infi|nite holine&s;s. All the holy meetings that ever were, or will be, are the re&s;ult of this, and the effect of &s;ome portion of holine&s;s &s;ent from it; for all holine&s;s i&s;&s;ues from it. Here <HI>mercy and truth meet together</HI> in a holy manner, <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace &s;alute</HI> each other in a holy way, and <HI>greet one ano|ther with a holy ki&s;s.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. It is a <HI>happy</HI> meeting. All happine&s;s and ble&s;&s;ings flow from this meeting; Chri&s;t the meeting-place is the centre <HI>of all &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings,</HI> Eph. 1.3. Many unhappy meetings have been in the world &s;ince &s;in entred into it, and &s;inful unholy meetings are ever mi&s;erable and unhappy meetings; but this holy meeting mu&s;t be a happy meeting; and this holy ki&s;s mu&s;t be a happy ki&s;s. If <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>truth</HI> had not met together, we had never met with God; if <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> and <HI>peace</HI> had never ki&s;&s;ed each other, we had never got a
<PB N="26" REF="040455_0025_10164608E682FE58">
ki&s;s of the fair face of the Son of God, nor ever been taken into the divine embraces.</P>
<P N="5">5. It is a <HI>free</HI> meeting. <HI>Mercy</HI> and <HI>truth</HI> met together freely, without being con&s;trained; <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> &amp; <HI>peace</HI> ki&s;&s;ed each other freely, without being forced. No motive from without could ever take place to move God to call this meet|ing from eternity; it was according to <HI>his own purpo&s;e and grace, which is given us in Chri&s;t Je&s;us before the world began,</HI> 2 Tim. 1.9. Free &s;overeign grace is the original of the meeting. It is al&s;o &s;uch a free a&s;&s;embly, where every mem|ber might freely &s;peak, and not one to interrupt another, as is u&s;ual in meetings among men, where &s;ome cry one thing, and &s;ome another, in a confu&s;ed manner, like that a&s;&s;embly, <HI>Acts</HI> 19.32. where it is &s;aid, <HI>The a&s;&s;embly was confu&s;ed, and the greater part knew not wherefore they were met together; and &s;ome cried one thing, and &s;ome another.</HI> No, this meeting is free, in oppo&s;ition both to all con&s;traint and compul&s;ion from without, and to all confu&s;ion and commotion from within. Where &s;overeign free grace is the ma&s;ter-convener, there can be no compul&s;ion; and, where the God of order is the great manager, there could be no confu&s;ion; and, where the God of peace was all in all, there could be no di&s;&s;ention.</P>
<P>Therefore,</P>
<P N="6">6. It is a <HI>harmonious</HI> meeting. Whatever different claims and preten&s;ions the members of the meeting &s;eem to have, yet they harmoniou&s;ly concur in advancing one another's honour and glory; and hence, as they mutually met together, &s;o they affectionately embrace one another. There was no di&s;cord at this a&s;&s;embly, no proper variance or &s;triving for &s;tate, but gloriou&s;ly con&s;piring with joint hearts and hands to glorify each other in the &s;alvation of a company of &s;inners by Je&s;us Chri&s;t. The divine e&s;&s;ence is undivided: And, as <HI>there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Spirit; and the&s;e three are One</HI>; So the attributes of God, however manifold to our apprehen&s;ion, yet there is no
<PB N="27" REF="040455_0026_1016460AC26F1BA0">
divi&s;ion among them, they are all one, and their con&s;piring together in Chri&s;t, for our redemption, is called <HI>the manifold wi&s;dom of God.</HI> The manifold perfections of God meet to|gether in one, with one con&s;ent, and with one heart. Behold <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> in one another's arms; and &s;o clo&s;e in the embracement, that they are ju&s;t one. Tho' it is a fall meet|ing, and all parties pre&s;ent, yet their is no war, no jar, no di&s;&s;ention, no divi&s;ion, but all harmony and concord, and love and affection; it is the mo&s;t peaceable meeting that ever was. And yet,</P>
<P N="7">7. It is a <HI>bloody</HI> meeting; and never was, and never will there be, &s;uch a bloody meeting in heaven or earth. <HI>The mercy-&s;eat mu&s;t be &s;prinkled with blood</HI>; mercy cannot be vented without blood, and truth cannot be cleared without blood, righteou&s;ne&s;s cannot be vindicated without blood, and peace cannot be purcha&s;ed without blood; <HI>Without &s;hed|ding of blood there is no remi&s;&s;ion,</HI> no mercy to be vented, no peace to be proclaimed; <HI>Chri&s;t hath made peace by the blood of his cro&s;s,</HI> Col. 1.20. <HI>A bloody hu&s;band ha&s;t thou been unto me,</HI> &s;aid <HI>Zipporah</HI>; but, O how much more may Chri&s;t &s;ay, a bloody meeting hath this been unto me! <HI>Who is this that cometh from</HI> Edom, <HI>with dyed garments from</HI> Bozrah? <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 63.1. Why, what is the matter that his garment is dyed with blood? Why? when <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>truth</HI> met together, they pre&s;s'd to be &s;o near one another in him, that they pre&s;s'd the blood out of his veins; and &s;o it was a bloody meeting: And, when <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> and <HI>peace</HI> ki&s;s'd each other, it behoved to be in Chri&s;t; and &s;o the &s;word of ju&s;tice behoved to pierce him thro' and thro', that &s;o the&s;e &s;acred lips might meet and ki&s;s each other in his heart; and &s;o it was a bloody ki&s;s. They ki&s;s'd each other with &s;uch good will, that Chri&s;t was, as it were, brui&s;ed betwixt their lips, that the blood might cement and glue them together. One would think, &s;uch a bloody ki&s;s would be no plea&s;ant ki&s;s; nay, but <HI>it plea&s;ed the
<PB N="28" REF="040455_0027_1016460CA3118230">
Father to brui&s;e him.</HI> They met together on a &s;ea of blood: Thus it was a bloody meeting. Again,</P>
<P N="8">8. It is an <HI>efficacious</HI> meeting. Many meet and a&s;&s;emble together, and yet do nothing for their meeting, it is to no effect; but <HI>here mercy and truth meet together</HI> efficaciou&s;ly, co-operatively: All is done at the meeting that God propo&s;|ed to be done, and all is done that concerns the glory of God and &s;alvation of men; their meeting together is their working together, and that to perfection; <HI>For God the Lord is a rock, and his work is perfect.</HI> There meeting together is their building together, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 89.2, 3. <HI>I have &s;aid, mercy &s;halt be built up for ever: Thy faithfulne&s;s &s;halt thou e&s;tabli&s;h in the very heavens.</HI> There is <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>truth</HI> both building, and the foundation of the building is laid in Chri&s;t; <HI>I have made a covenant with my cho&s;en,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="9">9. It is an <HI>unexpected</HI> meeting, it is beyond the expecta|tion of men and angels. If friends and intimates &s;hould meet, and &s;alute one another, it would not be &s;urprizing; but to &s;ee oppo&s;ites, antipodes, and antagoni&s;ts meet toge|ther, and embrace each other, this were &s;urpri&s;ing and unex|pected: So, to &s;ee light and darkne&s;s, love and enmity, life and death meeting, how unexpected were that? Thus it is here, <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>truth, righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> and <HI>peace,</HI> the&s;e attributes of God, with re&s;pect to us, were oppo&s;ites and antipodes. The language of <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> is death and damna|tion to the &s;inner; the language of <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>peace</HI> is, life and &s;alvation to the &s;inner: And, when a &s;inner finds him|&s;elf pur&s;ued to death at the in&s;tance of divine ju&s;tice, and the truth and veracity of a God engaged again&s;t him, according to the threatning of the law; O how <HI>unexpected</HI> a rencounter is it, when he finds <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>peace</HI> meeting with <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>truth,</HI> and &s;topping the pur&s;uit, according to the promi&s;e of the go&s;pel, to the credit of the oppo&s;ite parties, &s;aying, <HI>Deli|ver his &s;oul from going down to the pit; I have found a ran&s;om,</HI> and &s;o all odds are made even, all oppo&s;ites reconciled, to the
<PB N="29" REF="040455_0028_10164611EB0D7048">
infinite &s;urpri&s;e, and beyond the expectation of all created beings! No wonder then, upon this meeting di&s;covered, the poor &s;ouls cries, <HI>Is this the manner of men, O Lord? O, who is like unto thee!</HI> Nay <HI>there is none like unto the God of</HI> Je&s;urun,, <HI>that rides on the heaven for their help, and in his ex|cellency on the &s;kies.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. It is an <HI>everla&s;ting,</HI> indi&s;&s;olvable meeting. Other meetings will adjourn their meetings from time to time and from place to place; yea, other meetings mu&s;t part; and, when they part, they may never meet again; and we that are here met, mu&s;t part, and never all meet again in time; even as &s;ome others that met together with us the la&s;t year, are away to eternity. But O, this meeting betwixt <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>truth, righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> and <HI>peace,</HI> is a meeting where there is no parting; the meeting is from everla&s;ting to everla&s;ting: Their meeting together, and ki&s;&s;ing each other, is an eter|nal and unchangeable meeting, and an eternal and unchange|able ki&s;s; it is every way like God, without beginning, with|out ending, and without &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. Whatever beginning, i&s;&s;ue or increa&s;e it hath with re&s;pect to its manife&s;tation to us, yet in it&s;elf it is &s;till the &s;ame in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who is <HI>the &s;ame ye&s;terday, to-day and for ever,</HI> Heb. 13.8. <HI>without any vari|ablene&s;s or &s;hadow of turning.</HI> The meeting never breaks up, it is a continued meeting never to be di&s;&s;olved, and there they ki&s;s one another to all eternity: <HI>for his mercy endureth for ever, and his righteou&s;ne&s;s to all generations</HI>; and <HI>becau&s;e of truth, meekne&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s, in his maje&s;ty he &s;hall ride pro&s;perou&s;ly</HI>; and <HI>of the increa&s;e of his government and peace there &s;hall be no end. I have &s;aid, mercy &s;hall be built up for ever</HI>; and I have &s;aid, <HI>Truth &s;hall be e&s;tabli&s;hed in the heavens.</HI> Why, what is the meaning of all the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions? The language is as if one glorious attribute of God &s;hould &s;ay to another, O the &s;in of man &s;ets us all as it were at variance&punc; and the whole creation knows not how to reconcile God with him&s;elf, if he &s;hall &s;ave one &s;inner; but, behold, we having

met together in Chri&s;t the righteou&s;ne&s;s, the ran&s;om, the a|tonement, the propitiation, having met together, we &s;hall never part again; having embraced one another in behalf of the&s;e poor mi&s;erable &s;inners, our arms &s;hall never &s;eparate, that are cla&s;ped together. <HI>Mercy &amp; truth have met together,</HI> &s;aying, you and I &s;hall never part; <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s &amp; peace have ki&s;&s;ed each other,</HI> &s;aying, you and I &s;hall never &s;under, nor &s;u&s;pend the embracement; neither death nor life, nor hell, nor devils, nor &s;in it&s;elf, &s;hall ever &s;eparate us. It is a bargain among us, a divine match; they have met together by an e|verla&s;ting covenant, &s;ealed the bargain with an everla&s;ting ki&s;s, &amp; ca&s;t a knot in an everla&s;ting righteou&s;ne&s;s, which is the band of the union, even Chri&s;t; <HI>for the covenant does &s;tand fa&s;t with him,</HI> P&s;al. 89.28. where you will al&s;o &s;ee how this everla&s;ting meeting is e&s;tabli&s;hed in Chri&s;t, <HI>ver.</HI> 14. <HI>Ju&s;tice &amp; judgment are the habitation of thy throne,</HI> or the e&s;tabli&s;hment of thy throne, as it may be rendered; <HI>And mercy and truth &s;hall go before thy face.</HI> And <HI>ver.</HI> 21. <HI>With him my hand &s;hall be e&s;tabli&s;hed, &amp; my faithfulne&s;s and my mercy &s;hall be with him.</HI> And, <HI>ver.</HI> 28. <HI>My mercy will I keep for him for ever.</HI> Thus it is an everla&s;ting meeting.</P>
<P>The <HI>fourth</HI> thing propo&s;ed was, <HI>why</HI> or for what <HI>rea&s;ons</HI> they have met together, and ki&s;&s;ed each other? Why have the prefections of the glorious God con&s;pired &s;o harmoniou&s;ly, and met together in &s;uch a &s;weet &s;olemnity? Surely &s;uch a meeting as this mu&s;t have noble de&s;igns in view; and I'll tell you the&s;e four rea&s;ons of the meeting, or four things that were to be concerted at this great a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P N="1">1. They met together, to concert mea&s;ures for advancing the glory of God to the highe&s;t. This parliament of heaven met together upon ways and means, for bringing in the grea|te&s;t revenue of prai&s;e and glory to the crown of heaven, to Father, Son and holy Gho&s;t, &amp; all the glorious attributes of this great and eternal God. The&s;e attributes con&s;pired har|moniou&s;ly to &s;et forth &amp; glorify them&s;elves mo&s;t illu&s;triou&s;ly.
<PB N="31" REF="040455_0030_1016461515368EA8">
They met together, and ki&s;&s;ed one another, that they migh glorify each other. The glory of God, was the fir&s;t and la&s;t end of the meeting: What is the chief end of man, but to glorify God, and enjoy him for ever? And O, what is the chief end of God! It is even to glorify him&s;elf in all his per|fections, and to enjoy him&s;elf for ever. And, how does God glorify him&s;elf mo&s;t brightly? It is even in Chri&s;t the meet|ing-place of the&s;e perfections, with a view to our redemp|tion, <HI>To the prai&s;e of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved,</HI> Eph. 1.6.

They met together, to put a <HI>crown of glory</HI> upon the head of Chri&s;t, <HI>Heb.</HI> 2.9. in whom they met.

And &s;o we find them doing, <HI>Rev.</HI> 5.9. <HI>Thou art worthy to take the book, and open the &s;eals; for thou wa&s;t &s;lain, and ha&s;t redeemed us to God by thy blood.</HI> It is concerted in that meeting, that all the angels &s;hall glorify him: Hence that edict comes forth, <HI>Let all the angels of God wor&s;hip him,</HI> Heb. 1.6.

Why then, we may reckon that you have found &s;omething of the &s;aving fruits of this glorious meeting; for the grand de&s;ign of it was to glorify God in Chri&s;t, by the &s;pirit.

face of Chri&s;t.</HI> Here &s;ee the glory of divine mercy! What is pardoning mercy? It is God's free gracious acceptance of a &s;inner, upon &s;atisfaction made to his ju&s;tice, in the blood of Je&s;us; Nor is any di&s;covery of mercy, but as relating to the &s;atisfaction of ju&s;tice, con&s;i&s;tent with the glory of God; mercy cannot be &s;een &s;avingly, but as meeting with ju&s;tice in Chri&s;t. Here al&s;o we &s;ee the glory of divine truth in the exact accompli&s;hment of all his threatnings and promi&s;es. That original threatning and commination, whence all other threatnings flow, <HI>Gen.</HI> 2.17. 'In the day thou eate&s;t there|of thou &s;halt &s;urely die, <HI>backed with a cur&s;e,</HI> 'For cur&s;ed is 'every one that continues not in all things, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is in him accompli&s;hed fully, and the truth of God therein cleared to our &s;alvation, while <HI>he ta&s;ted death death for us, and was made a cur&s;e for us</HI>; &s;o that, in every threatning his truth is made glorious. And, as to the promi&s;es, <HI>they are all</HI> Yea <HI>and</HI> Amen <HI>in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, to the glory of God by us.</HI> 2 Cor. 1.20. And &s;o of all the other attributes of God, they are made glorious and exalted in Chri&s;t to our &s;alvation. Hence when Chri&s;t de&s;ired his father to glorify his name, <HI>John</HI> 12.28. to make his name, that is, his nature, and properties, and perfections all glorious in the work of redemption, that he had in hand; he was in&s;tantly an&s;wered from heaven,
<Q>I have both glori|fied it and will glorify it again;</Q>
I will give my attributes their utmo&s;t glory in thee.</P>
<P N="3">3. Hence &s;ee the difference betwixt the <HI>law</HI> and the <HI>go&s;|pel.</HI> One great difference betwixt them lies in this, that, in the law, the &s;inner that hath violated the &s;ame, may &s;ee <HI>truth</HI> &s;tanding engaged again&s;t him, but no <HI>mercy</HI> in company with <HI>truth</HI>; and <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> in arms again&s;t him, but no <HI>peace</HI> in company with <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s. Ju&s;tice without mercy,</HI> and <HI>war without peace,</HI> to the &s;inner, is the <HI>motto</HI> of the law: For therein <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> meet together, but <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>peace</HI> are not at the meeting; and &s;o the language of the law,
<PB N="46" REF="040455_0045_101646396C3828F0">
to you that are out of Chri&s;t, and under the law, is, no mercy, no peace, but the wrath of God, the vengeance of God, the cur&s;e of God upon you, and that &s;o &s;ure as God is a God of <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI>: There is the <HI>law.</HI> But in the <HI>go&s;pel, mercy</HI> and <HI>peace</HI> come into the <HI>meeting,</HI> and make up a <HI>match</HI> betwixt all the <HI>oppo&s;ite-like parties, to the highe&s;t glory of God, and the greate&s;t happine&s;s of the &s;inner; and they &s;eal the match with a ki&s;s of infinite complacency,</HI> &s;o that the &s;um of the go&s;pel is this, <HI>mercy and truth are met together, righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace have ki&s;&s;ed each other.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Hence we may &s;ee what is the fountain-head and foun|dation of all true <HI>communion</HI> and <HI>fellow&s;hip</HI> with God and man. This glorious meeting is the foundation of all other happy meetings; fellow&s;hip with God, &amp; an happy meeting with him, is a &s;tream that flows from this fountain. We could never have met with God, or got a kindly ki&s;s or em|brace in the arms of his favour and love, if this divine meet|ing and embracement had not made way for it. Fellow&s;hip with man, or the communion of &s;aints, is a rivulet that flows from this &s;pring. When &s;aints meet together for prayer or prai&s;es, under the influence of the &s;pirit, and under a gale of heaven; when their hearts are fired with love to God, and to one another in him; what is this? It is ju&s;t a live-coal ca&s;t in among them from the altar, Chri&s;t Je&s;us, where all the attributes of God meet together, and ki&s;s each other; and hence true fellow&s;hip with God, and with the &s;aints, are both declared to be in and thro' Chri&s;t Je&s;us, 1 <HI>John</HI> 1.3.
<Q>That which we have heard and &s;een, declare we unto you, that ye may have fellow&s;hip with us: And truly our fel|low&s;hip is with the Father, and with his Son Chri&s;t.</Q>
The harmony of the attributes of God in Chri&s;t, is the fountain of all the harmony among the &s;aints: The little harmony that takes place among them in our day, and the rarity of holy fellow&s;hip meetings, flows from the little faith of this
<PB N="47" REF="040455_0046_1016463B42BC12C0">
heavenly divine meeting; for all the &s;aints, that are under the lively views thereof, cannot but de&s;ire to meet together and embrace eaach other harmoniou&s;ly, in the arms of mutual love.</P>
<P N="5">5. Hence &s;ee the malignity of the &s;in of <HI>unbelief,</HI> the great employment whereof is, to <HI>&s;poil the harmony</HI> of the divine perfections, and to do its utmo&s;t to <HI>di&s;&s;olve</HI> that glorious meeting, and <HI>&s;eparate</HI> what God hath joined, &s;aying, in ef|fect, they have not met together, nor ki&s;&s;ed each other. This we may di&s;cern in the unbelief, whether of &s;ecure or awak|ened &s;inners: See it in the unbelief of the &s;ecure &s;inner, who &s;ets <HI>truth</HI> &amp; <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> out of the meeting, &s;aying, God, is a merciful God, <HI>&amp; I &s;hall have peace, tho' I walk in the immagina|tion of my own heart, adding drunkenne&s;s to thir&s;t</HI>: Thus <HI>they hope in God's mercy,</HI> &amp; &s;peak peace to them&s;elves, while they never view the truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s of God, and how the credit thereof &s;hall be &s;aved, or the honour thereof repaired&punc; hence, as faith is &s;aid to <HI>&s;et to the &s;eal, that God is true,</HI> or that he is a God of truth, &s;o unbelief is &s;aid to <HI>make God a liar.</HI> To fancy that God will have mercy on their &s;ouls, without regarding the truth of his threatnings, is to make God a liar, and &s;ay, mercy and truth have not met together; to think that God will be at peace with them, while his righteou&s;ne&s;s and ju&s;tice are not &s;atisfied, is to make God a liar, and &s;ay, righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace have not met together. Thus the unbelief of the &s;ecure &s;inner puts <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> out of the meeting. Again, on the other hand, the unbelief of the awakened &s;inner puts <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>peace</HI> out of the meeting, &s;aying, O he is a God of truth, and how &s;hall he have mercy on the like of me? He is a God of awful ju&s;tice and righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, and how will he be at peace with me? What is the language of this, but that <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>peace</HI> have not met with <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI>? Here is a making God a liar al&s;o, and &s;eparating what God hath in the go&s;pel declared to be

joined. Behold then the malignity of unbelief; it breaks the glorious meeting, and will not let them ki&s;s one another. The pre&s;uming &s;inner will not let God have the glory of his truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s, the de&s;pairing &s;inner will not let God have the glory of his mercy and grace; both are in a concert with the devil to break the harmony of the meeting. But O, may virtue come from that glorious meeting in Chri&s;t, to the poor &s;inful meeting in this hou&s;e, for da&s;hing your unbelief to pieces, that we may &s;ee <HI>mercy and truth meet together, righte|ou&s;ne&s;s and peace ki&s;&s;ing each other.</HI></P>

Here's an an&s;wer to all the objections of unbelief and diffidence, the chief whereof lies here; O, &s;ays unbelief, may I, &s;inful guil|ty I, lay hold on the promi&s;e of mercy and peace in the go&s;|pel, when I &s;ee the great ordnance of the divine threatning hard charged with the truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s of God, and ready to be di&s;charged again&s;t me with thunder and lightning, &s;aying, no mercy, no peace; <HI>He that made thee will not have mercy upon thee</HI>; and <HI>there is no peace, &s;ays my God, to the wick|ed?</HI> Mercy and peace in the promi&s;e then, &s;ays unbelief, cannot take place with re&s;pect to me; for truth and righte|ou&s;ne&s;s in the threatning &s;tand in the way, <HI>like a flaming &s;word, to keep the way of the tree of life.</HI> Nay, but, &s;ays faith, here the promi&s;e and the threatning have met together, and ki&s;&s;ed each other in Chri&s;t; mercy in the promi&s;e, and ju&s;tice in the threatning, have met and agreed in him, <HI>in whom all the promi&s;es are Yea and Amen,</HI> and in whom all the threatnings are fully executed, by drawing out his heart-blood. Thus then, <HI>we have boldne&s;s to enter into the holie&s;t by the blood of Je&s;us,</HI> Heb. 10.19. <HI>By a new and living way, which he hath con&s;ecrated for us through the vail of his fle&s;h: Therefore let us draw near with a true heart, in full a&s;&s;urance of &s;aith.</HI> O what
<PB N="49" REF="040455_0048_101646413189CB10">
ground for the boldne&s;s and a&s;&s;ured confidence of faith, with particular application, notwith&s;tanding the threatning! The threatning hath nothing to &s;ay to me, &s;aith faith, for Chri&s;t hath &s;poken with it already, and &s;poken it out of breath; he hath left it &s;peechle&s;s and breathle&s;s; not a breathing of wrath in it towards me. The believer may have a million of doubts, while his unbelief keeps the chair; but let gallant faith come in, and take the room, it will di&s;pel them all. Let once unbelief break the harmony of this meeting of divine attributes in Chri&s;t, and then nothing but doubts of God's favour and mercy mu&s;t en&s;ue; but let faith view the har|mony, and &s;ee them meeting and ki&s;&s;ing each other, and then, according to the mea&s;ure of faith, &s;uch will be the mea&s;ure of holy boldne&s;s, confidence and per&s;wa&s;ion of the favour, mercy and good-will of God in Chri&s;t, with parti|cular application to the per&s;on him&s;elf. Take away unbe|lief from faith, and then not a &s;ingle doubt will remain be|hind: Unbelief creates all the doubts that are in the believer, his faith hath no part in them. The general doubtful faith of the <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> is not faith, but unbelief; and therefore no wonder that our forefathers abjured it in our national cove|nant. Behold the &s;ure ground and firm bottom that faith &s;tands upon, even the mutual meeting and embracement among the divine perfections in Chri&s;t. If you break and &s;eparate the meeting by unbelief, then your confidence is broken, and your peace with God marr'd; but, if you keep them toge|ther in your view by faith in Chri&s;t, then you have boldne&s;s confidence and affiance on this ground: yea, then God in Chri&s;t and you meet together, and ki&s;s each other.</P>

What makes your heart to ri&s;e again&s;t &s;in? and, when &s;in prevails, what makes you find your&s;elves unea&s;y, and continually out of your element, 'till the Lord return, and until you get a new dip in the <HI>Jordan of the blood of the Lamb</HI>?

the&s;e perfections of God, harmoniou&s;ly meeting and embrac|ing each other in Chri&s;t. Here is your duty and work, be|liever, in the wilderne&s;s; and now in all your &s;hort-comings therein, &s;till <HI>look again to God's holy temple,</HI> to Chri&s;t the meet|ing-place of the&s;e divine perfections: This is the mercy|&s;eat, of which God &s;ays, <HI>Exod.</HI> 25.22. <HI>There will I meet with thee, and commune with thee from between the Cherubims.</HI> And every new meeting with God there, will bring in new &s;trength for all your work and warfare in time, till God and you meet together, and embrace one another in glory through eternity?</P>
<P>And now, believer, I know you would de&s;ire that others &s;hould &s;hare of the &s;ame happine&s;s with you; and therefore pray that a &s;hort concluding word may be ble&s;&s;ed with pow|er to thou&s;ands that hear me. O ye that are <HI>by &s;tanders</HI> and <HI>hearers</HI> only, in what ever corner of this hou&s;e round about me, whether you be in my view or not, you are in God's view; and I have a word from him to you all: And, as I have told you what a terrible thing is is to live and die in un|belief with re&s;pect to this glorious device, &s;o now I would tell you your duty in this matter, and how you may &s;hare of the ble&s;&s;ings &amp; benefits, in time and for ever, that flow from this glorious meeting and embracement; and it is by ki&s;&s;ing the Son of God, in whom all the&s;e attributes of God do ki&s;s and embrace each other, P&s;al. 2.12. <HI>Ki&s;s the Son, le&s;t he be angry, and ye peri&s;h from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little: Ble&s;&s;ed are all they that tru&s;t in him.</HI> Ble&s;&s;ed are all they that ki&s;s and embrace him. Would you then &s;hare of the grace and glory that i&s;&s;ue from this wonderful meeting, and ineffable embracement among the divine perfections, in Chri&s;t the Son of God? O then, come and ki&s;s the Son: O down, down with carnal tho'ts, carnal ki&s;&s;ing, carrou&s;ing, and cajolling; here, here is an object worthy of the mo&s;t endeared embraces of the immortal &s;oul. O come, and

ki&s;s the Son, by believing in him, and applying the be|nefits of this glorious tran&s;action to your&s;elf: And, be who you will, if you ki&s;s and embrace the Son, you &s;hall find the&s;e glorious attributes of God ki&s;&s;ing and embracing you and hugging you in their arms, as a darling of heaven, and a &s;pecial favorite in the hou&s;e of God. Are the attributes of God embracing one another in Chri&s;t? O flee into their embraces, by fleeing into Chri&s;t. <HI>Say not, Chri&s;t is in hea|ven, how &s;hall I embrace him? For the word is nigh thee, even in your mouth, and in your heart,</HI> Rom. 10.8. <HI>q. d.</HI> So near is he in this word, that you may ki&s;s him with your mouth, as it were, and embrace him in your heart; and to take in his word of grace, and Chri&s;t in it, is to embrace him. What do you &s;ay again&s;t Chri&s;t? Are you afraid that <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> con&s;pire again&s;t you, and hinder <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>peace</HI> from ever meeting with you, and embracing you? O no, fear not; only believe, <HI>that mercy and truth are met together,</HI> and that <HI>righteou&s;|ne&s;s and peace have ki&s;&s;ed each other</HI> in Chri&s;t. <HI>Truth</HI> will not &s;tand in the way of <HI>mercy</HI>; for they have met together: <HI>Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s</HI> will not &s;tand in the way of <HI>peace</HI>; for they have ki&s;&s;ed each other. He is indeed an infinitely ju&s;t God, to take vengeance upon &s;in; but <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> will not hinder <HI>mercy</HI> from coming to you: Only believe that <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>mercy</HI> are reconciled in Chri&s;t, &s;o as <HI>mercy</HI> can vent it&s;elf towards you, to the credit of <HI>ju&s;tice.</HI> But O! may &s;uch a blackmouthed &s;inner as I, as black as hell and the devil, expect a ki&s;s of &s;uch an infinitely fair Je&s;us? Is that to be expected, that &s;uch op|po&s;ites &s;hould meet in one another's arms? Ye, allow me, tho' a black &s;inner like your&s;elf, to be the happy me&s;&s;enger, to tell you in God's name, that be you as black as you will, &s;uch a meeting and embracing betwixt Chri&s;t and you is more to be expected, than ever men or angels could have expected that infinite <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>mercy</HI> &s;hould have met together, and ki&s;&s;ed each other in a God-man; and this unexpected meeting
<PB N="62" REF="040455_0061_101646656CCEA848">
is the very ground upon which your expectation of a meeting with, &amp; embracement of God in Chri&s;t, is to be founded: O then, come, &amp; ki&s;s the Son. Why but I cannot, &s;ay you; I think I would fain do it; but I cannot get at him, to ki&s;s and embrace him. Indeed this kindne&s;s mu&s;t begin on his &s;ide; and therefore, O pray that he would come, &amp; meet you with a ki&s;s of infinite love. Say with the church, <HI>Song</HI> 1.2. <HI>Let him ki&s;s me with the ki&s;&s;es of his mouth: For his love is better then wine.</HI> If that be the language of your &s;oul, O I cannot embrace him; but my heart &s;ays, O let him come &amp; embrace me, and draw me out of the embracements of all my former lovers and lu&s;ts that I may never ki&s;s any idol in the world again, but may live &amp; die in the arms &amp; embraces of the Son of God; is that the language of you &s;oul before the living GOD? why then the embracement betwixt Chri&s;t and you is begun, that &s;hall never have an end; for it is a pledge, that he and you &s;hall meet together in heaven, and embrace each other to eternity.</P>
<P>Now, though I hope that this glorious meeting of divine perfections in Chri&s;t hath put forth &s;ome vitrue to draw in &s;ome poor &s;oul to the match; yet I fear that the mo&s;t part are yet but idle hearers &amp; &s;pectators, as if they were not concern|ed: But O unconcerned &s;oul, be who you will, O yet, will you come and &s;ee this great &s;ight! O come and &s;ee the <HI>greate&s;t &s;ight that ever was,</HI> or will be, in heaven or earth, <HI>a bu&s;h burn|ing and not con&s;umed</HI>; all the burning and &s;hining attributes of God meeting together with infinite harmony in the bu&s;h of our nature, and yet the bu&s;h able <HI>to bear the glory,</HI> Zech. 6.13. O come and wonder! Here is the wonder of men and angels! For this is a wonderful meeting to them: And the name of the meeting-place is ju&s;tly called, <HI>wonderful</HI>! O come and partake; for the meeting is concerning your &s;alva|tion in Chri&s;t: <HI>His delights were with the &s;ons of men.</HI> O come and &s;ing to the prai&s;e and glory of this wonderful harmonious embracement of divine perfections in Chri&s;t, e&s;pecially you

that partake, &s;o as to &s;ee the glory, and feel the virtue thereof O will you &s;ing with your hearts, and lips, and lives, &s;aying. <HI>Glory to God,</HI> that his attributes have meet together, and ki&s;&s;ed each other, in Chri&s;t; and that ever the like of me got a ki&s;s by the by: <HI>Glory to God,</HI> that there is no breaking off this <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters">ting, nor parting of the&s;e embraces, by &s;in, <HI>Satan,</HI> earth or hell; but that they meet and embrace each other to eternity.
