<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Public was much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed at Major Andre's Death; and by that Di&s;tre&s;s, gave the highe&s;t Te&s;timony of his Merit. The Inhabitants, within the Briti&s;h Lines, were equally affected with the Army; whil&s;t their joint Indignation manife&s;tly &s;hewed the ge|neral Sen&s;e of the Inju&s;tice and Inhumanity with which that amiable and gallant Officer was treated by the Rebels. Tho&s;e who were &s;o much intere&s;ted in his Behalf, are probably de&s;irous of &s;eeing his Ca&s;e properly &s;tated&mdash;this is done in the following Papers.</P>
<P>The Letters that were written during the Tran&s;actions which proved &s;o fatal to Major Andre, will be&s;t elucidate his Views and Conduct. Tho&s;e Letters, accordingly, are here produced, with other Papers &s;ub&s;ervient to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e. The &s;everal Events, as they ro&s;e, are al&s;o connected in a regular Series, and Facts are fairly repre|&s;ented. Ju&s;tice to Major Andre's Memory, required that the&s;e Mat|ters &s;hould be placed in a true Light; e&s;pecially as the Account of his Ca&s;e and Trial, lately publi&s;hed by the Rebels (which is very imper|fect and partial) evidently tends to tarni&s;h his Character, as well as to ju&s;tify, or at lea&s;t to palliate, their barbarous Treatment of him. To relate Truth, is, in this as in many other Ca&s;es, the &s;ame as to refute Fal&s;ehood and Mi&s;repre&s;entation.</P>
<P>The Remarks that are &s;ubjoined, were naturally &s;ugge&s;ted by the &s;everal Facts; they throw Light upon the Subject, and the intelligent Reader will perceive that they and the Conclu&s;ions which accompany them, are fairly deducible from the Premi&s;&s;es alluded to in each In|&s;tance.</P>

<HEAD>CASE of MAJOR ANDRE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>A CORRESPONDENCE having been carried on, for &s;ome time, between the Comman|der in Chief and Major General Arnold, through Major Andre, on a very intere&s;ting &s;ubject, an interview was agreed upon to concert and adju&s;t &s;uch mea&s;ures as might lead to an attainment of the object in view. Major General Arnold earne&s;tly urged that Major Andre, the Adjutant General, might be the per&s;on to repre&s;ent his Excellency at the conference, which was acceded to. They were to meet on Monday the 11th of September, at a place called Dobb's Ferry.</P>
<P>But the interview was unhappily defeated by an accident which could not be fore&s;een, and which it was then too late to prevent. The boat that had in it Major General Arnold, was fired upon b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> one of his Maje&s;ty's gun-boats, which happened to be near; and from which the Gene|ral, with much difficulty, and at great hazard, e&s;caped.</P>
<P>Although this interview was defeated, and the good con&s;equences that might have been ex|pected from it, at lea&s;t delayed, the object was con&s;idered as of too much importance to be relin|qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;hed on a &s;ingle di&s;appointment; and it was therefore pur&s;ued in a way that gave much rea&s;on to hope for a &s;ucce&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ful i&s;&s;ue. Accordingly, on Saturday the 16th, Col. Robin&s;on went on board the Vulture &s;loop of war, which proceeded with him up the North River as far as Taller's Point. From thence h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> convoyed a letter to Major General Arnold, covering one to General Putnam, in which he took occa&s;ion to mention,
<Q>That having heard General Putnam was at the High-Lands, he had obtained leave of the Commander in Chief to endeavour to gain an interview with him. He added, that if General Putnam &s;hould have already returned to Connecticut, he wi&s;hed to have the letter returned.</Q>
This letter was dated on board the Vulture, off Taller's Point, 17th September, 1780</P>
<P>Major General Arnold, in his letter of the 18th, in an&s;wer to the foregoing, mentioned Ge|neral Putnam's previous departure for Connecticut; and according to Col. Robin&s;on's de&s;ire, returned the letter to him. He &s;aid
<Q>he had mentioned the &s;ubject to General Wa&s;hington, who thought that any application of the kind ought to have been made to the civil authority, as not belonging to the military department </Q>
Major General Arnold, however, &s;ubjoined,
<Q>that if any other propo&s;als &s;hould be made, of which he could officially take notio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the know|ledge of them &s;hould be confined inviolably to General Wa&s;hington and him&s;elf.</Q></P>
<P>This letter enclo&s;ed an ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">of the &s;ame date to Col. Robin&s;on, and one to Major Andre. In that to the former Gentleman. Major General Arnold &s;ays,
<Q>I &s;hall &s;end a per&s;on to Dobbe's Ferry, or on board the Vulture, on Wedne&s;day night the 20th in&s;tant, and furni&s;h him with a boat and flag of truce. You may depend on his &s;ecrecy and honour, and that your badne&s;s, of whatever nature, &s;hall be kept a profound &s;ecret.</Q>
He adds,
<Q>I have enclo&s;ed a letter
<PB N="6" REF="016731_0004_0F9E702399B688E8">
for a Gentleman in New-York, from one in the country, on private bu&s;ine&s;s, which I beg the favour of you to forward, and make no doubt he will be permitted to come at the time ap|pointed.</Q>
It can ea&s;ily be perceived, that this letter, although it was nece&s;&s;ary then that it &s;hould wear the appearance of one from a farmer to a Gentleman in New-York, was in real<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ty a letter from General Arnold, under the a&s;&s;umed &s;ignature of <HI>Gu&s;tavus,</HI> to Major Andre; in which the latter was invited to a conference under the expre&s;&s;ed condition and protection of a flag of truce. It bears date the 15th of September, and is the duplicate of one &s;ent on the 16th by the way of Kings Bridge. As this letter, which General Arnold &s;o anxiou&s;ly wi&s;hed might reach Major Andre, will naturally introduce the &s;ub&s;equent proceedings that took place through the whole cour&s;e of the affair, it is given to the public for their information.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON the 11th, at noon, agreeable to your reque&s;t, I attempted to go to Dobbs's Ferry, but was prevented by the armed boats of the enemy, who fired upon us, and continued oppo&s;ite the ferry until &s;un-&s;et.</P>
<P>The foregoing letter was wrote to caution you not to mention your bu&s;ine&s;s to * * * or any other per&s;on. I have no Confidant: I have made one too many already, which has prevented &s;ome profitable &s;peculations.</P>
<P>I will &s;end you a per&s;on, in whom you can confide, by water to meet you at Dobbs's Ferry, at the landing on the ea&s;t &s;ide, on Wedne&s;day the 20th in&s;tant, who will conduct you to a place of &s;afety, where I will meet you. It will be nece&s;&s;ary for you to be di&s;gui&s;ed, and, if the enemy's boats are there, it will favour my plan, as the per&s;on is not &s;u&s;pected by them. If I do not hear from you before, you may depend on the per&s;on's being punctual at the place above-mentioned.</P>
<P>Meet me if po&s;&s;ible: You may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, that if there is no danger in pa&s;&s;ing your lines, you will be perfectly &s;afe where I propo&s;e a meeting, of which you &s;hall be informed on Wedne&s;day evening, if you think proper to be at Dobbs's Ferry.&mdash;Adi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u, and be a&s;&s;ured of the friend&s;hip of</P>

<P>THE foregoing I found means to &s;end to King&s;bridge on the 16th, and make no doubt you received it. But as there is a po&s;&s;ibility of its mi&s;carrying, I &s;end you a copy, and am fully per&s;uaded, that the method I have pointed out to meet you is the be&s;t and &s;afe&s;t, provided you can obtain leave to come out.</P>

<P>In con&s;equence of which, it was determined that Major Andre &s;hould go; and here it will be proper to ob&s;erve, that the mea&s;ures hitherto taken, were within the knowledge of Sir Henry Clinton, and bore the function of his command.&mdash;But the nature of that &s;ervice was &s;uch, as might require future mea&s;ures to be taken that could not be immediately directed by a command &s;o di&s;tant from the &s;cene of operation; and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> that could be done in that ca&s;e was to guard again&s;t &s;uch contingencies or di&s;agreeable events as might po&s;&s;ibly happen in the way to &s;o great an object. In this view of the matter, Major Andre was put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of every nece&s;&s;ary cau|tion that became the dignity of command, or the milder affection of friend&s;hip. He was ex|pre&s;sly directed not to yield to General Arnold's propo&s;al that recommended a change of dre&s;s, but to wear his uniform and receive no papers.</P>
<P>Major Andre then proceeded up the North-river to the Vulture that lay near Taller's Point, and from thence wrote two letters to Sir Henry Clinton, both dated the 21&s;t of September.&mdash;The following are copies of them.</P>

<P>AS the tide was favourable on my arrival at the Sloop ye&s;terday, I was determined to be my&s;elf the bearer of your Excellency's letters as far as the Vulture. I have &s;uffered for it, having caught a very bad cold, and had &s;o violent a return of a di&s;order in my &s;tomach, which had attached me a few days ago, that Captain Sutherland and Colonel Robin&s;on in&s;i&s;t on my remaining on board until I am better.&mdash;I hope to-morrow to get down again.</P>

<HEAD>The other Letter.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I GOT on board the Vulture at about 7 o'clock la&s;t night and after con&s;idering upon the Letter, and the an&s;wers given by Colonel Robin&s;on, "that he would remain on board, and hoped I &s;hould be up," we thought it mo&s;t natural to expect the <HI>Man I &s;ent into the Country</HI> here, and therefore did not think of going to the Ferry.</P>
<P>No body has appeared. This is the &s;econd excur&s;ion I have made without an often&s;ible rea&s;on, and Colonel Robin&s;on both times of the party: A third would infallibly &s;ix &s;u&s;picions. I have therefore thought it be&s;t to remain here on pretence of &s;ickne&s;s, as my inclo&s;ed letter will feign, and try further expedients. Ye&s;terday the pretence of a flag of truce was made to draw people from the Vulture on &s;hore. The boat was fired upon in violation of the cu&s;toms of war. Cap|t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">in Sutherland, with great propriety, means to &s;end a flag to complain of this to General Ar|nold. A boat from the Vulture had very nearly taken him on the 11th. He was pur&s;ued clo&s;e to the float. I &s;hall favor him with a new&s;paper containing the Carolina newe, which I brought with me from New-York, for Ander&s;on to whom it is addre&s;&s;ed on board the Vulture.</P>

<P>On the 21&s;t of September, a flag of truce from General Arnold arrived on board the Vulture. The flag bearer was Mr. Jo&s;hua Smith, who produced two papers, the one authori&s;ing him to go with a flag of truce and two &s;ervants, for the purpo&s;e of forwarding two letters to New-York; and the other permitting a Mr. J. Ander&s;on, and a boy, to be brought within the Rebel lines. At the &s;ame time Mr. Smith delivered the following letter to Colonel Robin&s;on.</P>

<P>THIS will be delivered you by Mr. Smith, who will conduct you to a place of &s;afety. Neither Mr. Smith, or any other per&s;on &s;hall be made acquainted with your propo&s;als. If they (which I doubt not) are of &s;uch a nature, that I can officially take notice of them, I &s;hall do it with plea&s;ure; if not, you &s;hall be permitted to return immediately.

</LETTER>
<P>Colonel Robin&s;on, not being named in the flag, did not attend Major Andre. The caution u&s;ed about going in a manner that might afford any pretence for a di&s;pute on a &s;ubject of &s;o in|tere&s;ting a nature, is a deci&s;ive proof that the protection of the flag was deemed, as to tho&s;e who were named, &s;acred again&s;t any future <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">vils or tortured interpretations; and when it was determined that Major Andre alone &s;hould go with Mr. Smith, a difficulty was perceived in &s;u|&s;pect to the flag-boat which was large, and had but two men to row it. To obvi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> difficulty, one of the Vulture's boats was propo&s;ed to be manned, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t in towing it; but this offer was declined and &s;trongly objected to by Mr. Smith, and Major Andre, as di&s;a|greeing with the character of a flag of truce.</P>
<P>Major Andre was landed &s;afe in his uniform from the flag-boat at the landing place in Ha|ver&s;traw, the place where he was taught to expect General Arnold, who was to bring with him a &s;pare hor&s;e; from thence they were to repair to Mr. Smith's hou&s;e, di&s;tant a few miles from the &s;hore. He was punctually met by General Arnold, at who&s;e pre&s;&s;ing in&s;tance he exchanged his uniform for another dre&s;s; this was contrary to the &s;trong a&s;&s;urances which he gave Colonel Robin&s;on and Captain Sutherland, ju&s;t as he was leaving the Vulture; he told tho&s;e gentlemen
<Q>that he could not re&s;ign his rank, or give up his character, without violating the expre&s;s order of the Commander in Chief, which he was re&s;olved not to do.</Q>
This he &s;aid to avoid the offer made him by Captain Sutherland, of a plain coat for the concealment of his per&s;on.</P>
<P>Major Andre, after he had conc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rted &s;uch mea&s;ures with General Arnold as the nature of the &s;ervice required, received the General's order to return to New-York by land, in the habit he

was <HI>forced</HI> to a&s;&s;ume on his getting to &s;hore; and had regular pa&s;sports delivered to him for the protection and &s;afety of his per&s;on. On the 23d of September, he was taken at Tarry Town. The particular circum&s;tances attending that unfortunate event, may be collected from two letters written by Mr. Jame&s;on; one to General Arnold, the other to Lieutenant Allen, both dated the 25d September, of which the following are copies.</P>

<P>IN an&s;wer to your Excellency's Letter of the 26th in&s;tant, which I had the honour to receive, I am to inform you that Major Andre was taken under &s;uch circum&s;tances as would have ju&s;ti|fied the mo&s;t &s;ummary proceedings again&s;t him. I determined however to refer his ca&s;e to the examination and deci&s;ion of a board of General Officers, who have, on his free and voluntary con|fe&s;&s;ion and letters, reported,</P>
<P>"Fir&s;t, That he came on &s;hore from the Vulture Sloop of War, in the night of the 21&s;t of September la&s;t, on an interview with General Arnold, in a private and &s;ecret manner.</P>
<P>"Secondly, That he changed his dre&s;s within our lines, and under a feigned name, and in a di&s;gui&s;ed habit, pa&s;&s;ed our works at Stoney and Verplank's Points, the evening of the 22d of September la&s;t, and was taken the morning of the 23d of September la&s;t at Tarry Town, in a di&s;gui&s;ed habit, being then on his way to New-York; and when taken he had in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion &s;everal papers which contained intelligence for the enemy. The Board having maturely con|&s;idered the&s;e facts, do al&s;o report to his Excellency General Wa&s;hington, that Major Andre, Ad|jutant-General to the Briti&s;h army, ought to be con&s;idered as a &s;py from the enemy; and that, agreeable to the law and u&s;age of nations, it is their opinion he ought to &s;uffer death."</P>
<P>From the&s;e proceedings it is evident Major Andre was employed in the execution of mea&s;ures very foreign to the objects of flags of truce, and &s;uch as they were never meant to authori&s;e or countenance in the mo&s;t di&s;tant degree, and this gentleman confe&s;&s;ed with the greate&s;t candour, in the cour&s;e of his examination,
<Q>that it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to &s;uppo&s;e he came on &s;hore under the &s;anction of a flag.</Q></P>

</LETTER>
<P>On reading General Wa&s;hington's letter, and the report of the General Officers, it was very evident, that they were either in the dark re&s;pecting facts, or had injudiciou&s;ly formed their opi|nions from a wrong conclu&s;ion which Major Andre &s;eems to have drawn from his own ca&s;e. Warm hopes were therefore conceived, that on furni&s;hing the nece&s;&s;ary and obvious proofs, the difficulties in the way of Major Andre's &s;afety would be removed. Impre&s;&s;ed with that belief, Sir Henry Clinton a&s;&s;embled a Council of General Officers, who were a&s;&s;i&s;ted by &s;everal Gentlemen of the Council of the Commi&s;&s;ion, and &s;ubmitted to their con&s;ideration General Wa&s;hington's letter.</P>
<P>This con&s;ultation ended in a re&s;olution, formed by Sir Henry Clinton, of di&s;patching Lieu|tenant General Robert&s;on, with Mr. Elliot, the Lieutenant Governor, and Mr. Smith, the Chief Ju&s;tice of his Maje&s;ty's province of New-York, to &s;ome of the Rebel po&s;ts, with &s;uch proofs as might clear Major Andre from the imputation of a &s;py; and &s;o we all doubts on a que&s;tion in which humanity appeared to have &s;o much concern. The intention and purport of this deputa|tion were immediately communicated to General Wa&s;hington by the following letter, which was forwarded by the return of the &s;ame flag that brought his of the 30th.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON coming to anchor here I &s;ent Murray on &s;hore, who &s;oon returned with notice that Ge|neral Green was ready to meet me, but would not admit a conference with the other gen|tlemen.</P>
<P>I paid my compliments to his character, and expre&s;&s;ed the &s;atisfaction I had in treating with him on the cau&s;e of my friend, the two armies and humanity. He &s;aid he could not treat with me as an officer; that Mr. Wa&s;hington had permitted him to meet me an a gentleman, but the ca&s;e of an acknowledged &s;py admitted no official di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. I &s;aid that a knowledge of facts was nece&s;&s;ary to direct a General's judgment; that in whatever character I was called, I hoped he would repre&s;ent what I &s;aid candidly to Mr. Wa&s;hington.</P>
<P>I laid before him the facts, and Arnold's a&s;&s;ertions of Mr. Andre's being under a flag of truce, and di&s;gui&s;ed by his order. He &s;howed me a low-&s;pirited letter of Andre's, &s;aying that he had not landed under a flag of truce, and lamenting his being taken in a mean di&s;gui&s;e. H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> expre&s;ion this in language that admits it to be criminal. I told him that Andre &s;tated facts wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> truth, but rea&s;oned ill upon them; that whether a flag was flying or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, was of no moment. He &s;aid he would believe Andre in preferences to Arnold. This argument held long. I told him you had ever &s;hown a merciful di&s;po&s;ition, and an attention to Mr. Wa&s;hington's reque&s;ts; that in the in&s;tance of Robin&s;on, you had given up a man evidently a &s;py, when he &s;igni|fied his wi&s;h; that I courted an intercour&s;e and a return of good officer; that Andre had your friend&s;hip and good wi&s;hes, and that Mr. Wa&s;hington's humanity to him would be pro|ductive of acts of the &s;ame kind on our part; that if Green had a friend, or Mr. Wa&s;hington was de&s;irous of the relea&s;e of any man, if he would let me carry home Andre. I would engage to &s;end &s;uch a man out. He &s;aid that there was no treating about &s;pies. I &s;aid no military ca&s;ui&s;t in Europe would call Andre a &s;py, and would &s;uffer death my&s;elf if Mon&s;ieur Rochamhault, or General Kayphan&s;en, would call him by that name. I added, that I depended upon General Green's candour and humanity to put the facts I had &s;tated, and the arguments I had u&s;ed in their faire&s;t light to Mr. Wa&s;hington; that I would &s;tay on board all night, and hoped to carry Mr. Andre, or at lea&s;t Mr. Wa&s;hington's word for his &s;afety, along with me the next morning.</P>
<P>Green now with a blu&s;h, that &s;howed the ta&s;k was impo&s;ed, and did not proceed from his own thought, told me that the army mu&s;t be &s;atisfied by &s;eeing &s;pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> executed. But there was one thing that would &s;atisfy them&mdash;they expected if Andre was &s;et free, Arnold &s;hould be given up. This I an&s;wered with a look only, which threw Green into confu&s;ion. I am per&s;uaded Andre will not be hurt.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A NOTE I have from General Green, leaves me in doubt, if his memory has &s;erved him to relate to you with exactne&s;s, the &s;ub&s;tance of the conver&s;ation that pa&s;&s;ed between him and my&s;elf on the &s;ubject of Major Andre.</P>
<P>In an affair of &s;o much con&s;equence to my friend, to the two armies, and humanity, I would leave no po&s;&s;ibility of a mi&s;under&s;tanding; and therefore take the liberty to put in writing the &s;ub&s;tance of what I &s;aid to General Green.</P>
<P>I offered to prove by the evidence of Colonel Robin&s;on, and the officers of the Vulture, that Major Andre went on &s;hore at General Arnold's de&s;ire, in a boat &s;ent for him with a flag of truce; that he not only came a&s;hore with the knowledge, and under the protection of the General who commanded in the di&s;trict, but that he took no one &s;tep while on &s;tore, but by the direction of General Arnold, as will appear by the inclo&s;ed letter from him to your Excellency.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e circum&s;tances I could not, and hoped you would not, con&s;ider Major Andre as a &s;py, in con&s;equence of an improper phra&s;e in his letter to you. The facts he relates corre&s;pond with the evidence I offer; but he admits a conclu&s;ion that does not follow. The change of clothes and name was ordered by General Arnold, under who&s;e direction he nece&s;&s;arily was while within his command.</P>
<P>As General Green and I did not agree in opinion, I wi&s;hed that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ted gentlemen of knowledge in the law of war and nations, might be a&s;ked their opinion on the &s;ubject, and men|tioned General K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">yphau&s;on and Mon&s;ieur Rocha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ault.</P>
<P>I related that a Captain Robin&s;on had been delivered to General Clinton as a &s;py, and un|doubtedly was &s;uch; but it being &s;ignified to him, that you was de&s;irous this man &s;hould be ex|changed, he had ordered him to be exchanged.</P>
<P>I wi&s;hed that an intercour&s;e of &s;uch civilities as the rules of war admit of, might take off many of its horro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. I admitted that Major Andre had a great &s;hare of Sir Henry's e&s;teem, and that he would be infinitely obliged by his liberation; and that if he was permitted to return with me, I would engage to have any per&s;on you would be plea&s;ed to name &s;et at liberty.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="016731_0011_0F9E7029134040D0">I added, that Sir Henry had never put any per&s;on to death for a breach of the rules of war, though he has had, and has now, many in his power.</P>
<P>Under our pre&s;ent circum&s;tances much good may ari&s;e from humanity, much ill from the want of it. If that could have any weight, I beg leave to add, that your favourable treatment of Major Andre, would be a favour I &s;hould ever be intent to return to any you hold dear.</P>
<P>My memory does not retain, with the exactne&s;s I could wi&s;h, the words of the letter which General Green &s;hewed me from Major Andre to your Excellency. For Sir Henry Clinton's &s;atisfaction, I beg you will order a copy of it to be &s;ent to me at New-York.</P>

<P><HI>THE</HI> polite attention &s;hewn by your Excellency and the Gentlemen of your family to Mrs. Arnold, when in di&s;tre&s;s, demands my grateful acknowledgments and thanks, which I beg leave to prefer.</P>
<P>From your Excellency's letter to Sir Henry Clinton, I find a Board of General Officer: have given it as their opinion, that Major Andre is a &s;py. My good opinion of the candor and ju&s;tice of tho&s;e Gentlemen leads me to believe that if they had been made fully acquainted with every circum&s;tance re&s;pecting Major Andre they would by no means have con&s;idered him in the light of a &s;py or even of a pri&s;oner. In ju&s;tice to him I think it my duty to declare, that he came from on board the Vulture at my particular reque&s;t, by a flag &s;ent on purpo&s;e for him by Jo&s;hua Smith, E&s;q, who had permi&s;&s;ion to Dobbs's Ferry to carry letters, and for other purpo&s;es not mentioned and to return. Mr Smith at the &s;ame time had my po&s;itive directions to go on board the Vulture, and bring on &s;hore Col Robin&s;on or John Ander&s;on which was the name I had reque&s;ted Major Andre to a&s;+&s;ume At the &s;ame time I de&s;ired Mr. Smith to inform him that he &s;hould have my protection and a &s;afe pa&s;&s;|port to return in the &s;ame boat as &s;oon as our bu&s;ine&s;s was compleated As &s;everal accidents intervened to pre|vent his being &s;ent on board, I gave him my pa&s;&s;port to return by land. Major Andre came on &s;hore in his uni|form (without di&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;e) which with much reluctance at my particular and pre&s;&s;ing in&s;tance, he exchanged for another coat. I furni&s;hed him with a hor&s;e and a &s;addle, and pointed out the route by which he was to re|turn: And as Commanding Officer in the department, I had an undoubted right to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;act all the&s;e matters, which if wrong, Major Andre ought not to &s;uffer for them.</P>
<P>But if, after this ju&s;t and candid repre&s;entation of Major Andre's ca&s;e, the Board of General Officers adhere to their former opinion, I &s;hall &s;uppo&s;e it dictated by pa&s;&s;ion and re&s;entment; and if that Gentleman &s;hould &s;uf|fer the &s;everity of their &s;entence I &s;hall think my&s;elf <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d by everytie of duty and honour to retaliate on &s;uch unhappy per&s;ons of your army as may fall within my power, that the re&s;pect due to flags, and to the law <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> nations, may be better under&s;tood and ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>I have further to ob&s;erve, that forty of the principal inhabitants of South Carolina have ju&s;tly forfeited their lives which have hitherto been &s;pared by the clemency of his Excellency Sir Henry Clinton who cannot in ju&s;tice exten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his mercy to them any longer, if Major Andre &s;uffers; which, in all probability, will open a &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ene of blood at which humanity will revolt.</P>
<P>Suffer me to intreat your Excellency, for your own and the honour of humanity, and the love you have of ju&s;tice, that you &s;uffer not an unju&s;t &s;entence to touch the life of Major Andre.</P>

<P>I CONCEIVED I could not better or more fully explain my &s;entiments in an&s;wer to your Ex|cellency's letter of the 30th of September, re&s;pecting Major Andre, than by &s;ending Lieu|tenant General Robert&s;on to conver&s;e, if po&s;&s;ible, with you, Sir; at lea&s;t with &s;ome confidential officer from you. I cannot think Lieutenant General Robert&s;on's conver&s;ation with General Green has entirely an&s;wered the purpo&s;es for which I wi&s;hed the meeting. General Green's letter of the 2d in&s;tant to General Robert&s;on, expre&s;&s;es, that he had reported to you, Sir, as far as his memory &s;erved, the di&s;cour&s;e that had p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ed between them, and that it had not produced any alteration in your opinion or determination concerning Major Andre.</P>
<P>I have, Sir, mo&s;t carefully re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u&s;ed your letter of September 30th, which contains, indeed, an opinion of a Board of your General Officers, but is no re&s;pect any opinion or determination of your Excellency. I mu&s;t remain, therefore, altogether at a lo&s;s what they may be, until you are &s;o good to inform me, which I make no doubt of your Excellency's doing immediately. I will, Sir, in the mean time, very freely declare my &s;entiment, upon this occa&s;ion, which po&s;i|tively are, that under no d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;cription, Major Andre can be con&s;idered as a &s;py; nor by any u&s;age of nations at war, or the cu&s;tom of armies, can he be treated as &s;uch. That officer went at Ma|jor General Arnold's reque&s;t from me to him, at that time in the American &s;ervice, and Com|manding Officer at We&s;t-Point. A flag of tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce was &s;ent to receive Major Andre, with which he went on &s;hore, and met General Arnold To this period he was acting under my immediate orders as a military man. What happened after, was from the entire direction and po&s;itive orders of General Arnold, commanding at We&s;t-Point&punc; And Major Andre travelled in his way to New-York, with pa&s;&s;ports from that American General Officer, who had an undoubted right to grant them. And here it may be nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that Major Andre was &s;topped on the road, and on neutral ground, and made a pri&s;oner two days prior to Major General Arnold's quitting the American &s;ervice at We&s;t-Point. From all which I have a right to a&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rt, that Major Andre can merely be con&s;idered as a me&s;&s;enger, and not as a &s;py. He vi&s;ited no po&s;ts, made no plans, held no conver&s;ation with any per&s;on, except Major General Arnold; and the papers found upon him were written in that General Officer's own hand-writing, who directed Major Andre to receive and deliver them to me.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE account Col. Robin&s;on has given your Excellency of our tran&s;actions, during our late excur&s;ion, is &s;o full and ju&s;t in all its particulars, that there is very little left for me to add. But as they have been attended with &s;uch fatal con&s;equences to Major Andre, I hope it will not be held improper if I beg leave to &s;ubmit my own ob&s;ervations on the &s;ubject, at lea&s;t &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ar as they relate to his leaving the Vulture, and the light I then &s;aw them in.</P>
<P>Your Excellency has already been informed, that on the night of the 21&s;t of September, a Mr. Smith came on board with a flag of truce. The &s;ub&s;tance of hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> order was, for him&s;elf and two &s;ervants to pa&s;s to Dobbs's Ferry and back again. He likewi&s;e had a written permi&s;&s;ion to bring up with him a Mr. John Ander&s;on and boy, and a letter addre&s;&s;ed to Col. Robin&s;on: All the&s;e pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ers &s;igned <HI>B. Arnold.</HI></P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the&s;e circum&s;tances I had been previou&s;ly taught to expect; and I had al&s;o been in|formed that Major Andre was the per&s;on under&s;tood by Jo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n Ander&s;on, and that he was to go on &s;hore under that name, to hold a conference with General Arnold. Mr. Smith's powers ap|peared to me of &s;ufficient authority; and as Major Andre's going under a fictitious name was at the particular reque&s;t of the officer from whom they were derived, I &s;aw no rea&s;on for &s;uppo&s;ing he, from that circum&s;tance, forfeited his claim to the protection they mu&s;t otherwi&s;e have afforded him. Clear I am that the matter mu&s;t have appeared in the &s;ame light to him; for had it not, mea&s;ures might have been concer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed for taking him off whenever he plea&s;ed, which he very well knew I, at any time, was enabled to accompli&s;h. I am likewi&s;e per&s;uaded Mr. Smith's ideas perfectly coincided with ours; for when on the point of &s;etting off, Col. Robin&s;on ob&s;erved, that as they had but two men in a large boat, they would find &s;ome difficulty in getting on &s;hare, and propo&s;ed that one of our's &s;hould tow them &s;ome part of the way; to which he objected, as it might, in ca&s;e of falling in with any of their guard-boats, be deemed an infringement of the flag.</P>
<P>On my fir&s;t learning from Major Andre, that he did not intend going on &s;hore in his own name, it immediately occurred to me, that an alteration of dre&s;s might be likewi&s;e nece&s;&s;ary; and I offered him a plain blue coat of mine for that purpo&s;e, which he declined accepting, as he &s;aid he had the Commander in Chief's direction to go in his uniform, and by no means to give up his character; adding, at the &s;ame time, that he had not the &s;malle&s;t apprehen&s;ion on the occa&s;ion, and that he was ready to attend General Arnold's &s;ummons, when and where he plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>The night the flag was fir&s;t expected, he expre&s;&s;ed much anxiety for its arrival, and all next day was full of fear le&s;t any thing &s;hould have happened to prevent its coming. The in&s;tant it arrived on the en&s;uing night, he &s;tarted out of bed, and di&s;covered the greate&s;t impatience to be gone; nor did he in any in&s;tance betray the lea&s;t doubt of his &s;afety or &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>I own I was equally confident, nor can I now on the mo&s;t mature con&s;ideration, find the lea&s;t rea&s;on for altering my opinion. What, therefore, could po&s;&s;ibly have given ri&s;e to &s;o tragical an event, as has unhappily befallen Major Andre, is matter of the utmo&s;t &s;urprize and concern to me.</P>

<P>The di&s;patch of the&s;e Letters was prevented by the arrival of Major Andre's &s;ervant with his ma&s;ter's baggage; and an account of Major Andre's having &s;uffered the barbarous &s;entence of the Board of General Officers. He was executed at 12 o'clock, on the &s;econd day of October, and in the Rebel camp. In con&s;equence of which, the Commander in Chief was plea&s;ed to i&s;&s;ue the following orders to the army.</P>

<P>THE Commander in Chief does with infinite regret, inform the army of the death of the Adjutant General, Major Andre.</P>
<P>The unfortunate fate of this officer, calls upon the Commander in Chief to declare his opi|nion, that he ever con&s;idered Major Andre as a gentleman, as well as in the line of his military profe&s;&s;ion, of the highe&s;t integrity and honour, and incapable of any ba&s;e action, or unworthy conduct.</P>
<P>Major Andre's death is very &s;everely felt by the Commander in Chief, as it a&s;&s;uredly will by the whole army; and m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t prove a real lo&s;s to his country, and to his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>To this narrative of the tran&s;actions relating to Major Andre, it may be proper to &s;ubjoin &s;ome Remarks on his Ca&s;e, which is &s;o &s;ingular.</P>
<P N="1">I. Major Andre was put to death, by the rebels, as a &s;py; but it is freely &s;ubmitted to the candid, unprejudiced Reader, after he has peru&s;ed the preceding Ca&s;e, whether the charge was not groundle&s;s.</P>
<P>Spies are per&s;ons who in&s;inuate them&s;elves among an enemy, pry into their de&s;igns, and view their army, camp, or fortifications. The character of &s;pies nece&s;&s;arily implies, and the nature of their bu&s;ine&s;s requires, that they &s;hould <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> clande&s;tinely, without the knowledge or privity of the enemy, e&s;pecially of their principal Commanders; and they are generally allured to un|dertake this &s;ervice by pecuniary rewards. Now every thing of this &s;ort was foreign to Major Andre's de&s;ign. His &s;tation placed him above &s;uch &s;ervice; his bu&s;ine&s;s was of quite a different nature. He had been invited to a conference by Major General Arnold; and to hold that con|ference was his only object in going a&s;hore from the Vulture. The place appointed for their in|terview was without the enemy's po&s;ts; Major Andre went a&s;hore in his uniform, and in a boat <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> as a flag of truce by General Arnold, the Commanding Officer of the di&s;trict, to carry him; and he went with the intention of immediately returning when the conference was ended. Do any of the&s;e circum&s;tances indicate the &s;py? Do they not evidently &s;how that the character did not belong to Major Andre?</P>
<P>But the rebels a&s;&s;ert that Major Andre did not go a&s;hore in a flag of truce. This is repeatedly mentioned or in&s;inuated in the "Proceedings of a Board of General Officers <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lately publi&s;hed in Philadelphia, &s;ince <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> printed in New-York.</NOTE>," who tried and condemned Major Andre: it was al&s;o urged by General Green, in the conference with Lieu|tenant General Robert&s;on. To prove the a&s;&s;ertion, they alledge that the boat in which Major Andre went, <HI>had no white flag flying;</HI> and that Major Andre him&s;elf acknowledged to the Board of Officers.
<Q>it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to &s;uppo&s;e he came on &s;hore under the &s;anction of a flag;</Q>

<SALUTE>SIR.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHAT I have as yet &s;aid concerning my&s;elf, was in the ju&s;tifiable attempt to be extricated; I am too little accu&s;tomed to dupl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">city to have &s;ucceeded.</P>
<P>I beg your Excellency will be per&s;uaded, that no alteration in the temper of my mind, or appre|hen&s;ion for my &s;afety, induces me to take the &s;tep of addre&s;&s;ing you, but that it is to &s;ecure my&s;elf from an imputation of having a&s;&s;umed a mean character for treacherous purpo&s;es or &s;elf intere&s;t. A conduct incompatible with the principles that actuated me, as well as with my condition in life.</P>
<P>It is to vindicate my fame that I &s;peak and not to &s;olicit &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>The per&s;on in your po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion is Major John Andre, Adjutant-General to the Briti&s;h army.</P>
<P>The influence of one Commander in the army of his adver&s;ary is an advantage taken in war. A corre&s;pondence for this purpo&s;e I held; as confidential (in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance) with his Excellency Sir Henry Clinton.</P>
<P>To favour it, I agreed to meet upon ground not within po&s;ts of either army, a per&s;on who was to give me intelligence; I came up in the Vulture man of war for this effect, and was fetched by a boat from the &s;hore to the beach: Being there, I was told that the approach of day would prevent my return, and that I mu&s;t be concealed until the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> night. I was in my regimentals and had fairly ri&s;ked my per&s;on.</P>
<P>Again&s;t my &s;tipulation, my intention, and without my knowledge before hand, I was conducted within one of your po&s;ts. Your Excellency may conceive my &s;en&s;ation on this occa&s;ion, and will imagine how much more mu&s;t I have been affected, by a refu&s;al to reconduct me back the next night as I had been brought. Thus become a pri&s;oner, I had to concert my e&s;cape. I quitted my uniform, and was pa&s;&s;ed another way in the night without the American po&s;ts to neutral ground, and informed I was beyond all armed parties, and left to p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> New-York. I was taken at Tarvy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> by &s;ome volunt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rs.</P>
<P>Thus, as I have had the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">our to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, was I betrayed (being Adjutant General of the Briti&s;h army) into the vile condition of an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in di&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> within your po&s;ts.</P>
<P>Having avowed my&s;elf a Briti&s;h officer, I have nothing to reveal but what relates to my&s;elf, "which is true on the honour of an officer and a gentleman.</P>
<P>The reque&s;t I have to make your Excellency, and I am con&s;cious I addre&s;s my&s;elf well, is, that in any rigor policy may dictate, a decency of conduct towards me may mark, that though unfortunate, I am branded with nothing di&s;honourable, as no motion could be mine but the &s;ervice of my King, and as I was involuntarily an impo&s;tor.</P>
<P>Another reque&s;t is, that I may be permitted to write an open letter to Sir Henry Clinton, and "another to a friend for cloaths and linen.</P>
<P>I take the liberty to mention the condition of &s;ome gentlemen at Charle&s;town, who being either on parole or under protection, were engaged in a con&s;piracy again&s;t us. Though their &s;ituation is not &s;imilar, they are objects who may be &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t in exchange for me, or are per&s;ons whom the treatment I re|ceive might affect.</P>
<P>It is no le&s;s, Sir, in a confidence in the genero&s;ity of your mind, than on account of your &s;uperior &s;tation, that I have cho&s;en to importune you with this letter.</P>

<TRAILER>His Excellency General Wa&s;hington, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</TRAILER>
</LETTER></NOTE>, have been al&s;o urged to the &s;ame purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="016731_0015_0F9E701C19960898">But there it the cleare&s;t evidence from the expre&s;s te&s;timony of General Arnold, Colonel Re|bin&s;on, and Captain Sutherland, that Major Andre went a&s;hore under the &s;anction of a flag. The boat indeed might not have had a white flag di&s;played; but the rea&s;on was, that it came in the night, when a white flag could not be &s;een, and was therefore u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="016731_0016_0F9E702A59CC7E00">Mr. Jo&s;hua Smith, who commanded the boat, was authori&s;ed by General Arnold, to go to the Vulture, and bring a &s;hore the per&s;ons &s;pecified in his commi&s;&s;ion. This commi&s;&s;ion he pro|duced on board the Vulture; it was written by General Arnold, the officer who commanded on &s;hore; and it con&s;tituted his boat a real flag of truce, whether it came by day or by night; whether it had, or had not, a white flag di&s;played. Thus exactly &s;tands the ca&s;e, which fully refutes the a&s;&s;ertions of General Green, and the other rebel officers on this head. Indeed General Wa&s;h|ington, con&s;cious that this a&s;&s;ertion could not be maintained, abandons it, and gives the matter a different turn in his letter to the Commander in Chief, dated <HI>Sept.</HI> 30, 1780; although that <HI>turn</HI> makes no more again&s;t Major Andre, than the a&s;&s;ertion that the boat was not a flag of truce.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e, there are other circum&s;tances which clearly prove that the boat to que&s;tion was con&s;idered as a true, proper flag of truce. It is evident that Mr. Smith, was not privy to General Arnold's de&s;igns, and that he knew nothing of Major Andre' bu&s;ine&s;s. In this ca&s;e, would be have ventured to go to an enemy's &s;hip of war, had he not conceived him&s;elf to be under the &s;anction of a flag? Colonel Robin&s;on intended to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">company Major Andre, but as his name was not mentioned in General Arnold's flag, he was la&s;t behind. When it was propo&s;ed to man the Vulture's boat, and a&s;&s;i&s;t in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing Mr. Smith's boat, which had but two men to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ow it; Ma|jor Andre, and Mr. Smith, &s;trongly objected to it, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> not con&s;i&s;tent with the character of a flag. Can any thing be more evident than that this boat was a flag of truce, and was con&s;idered as &s;uch by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tion?</P>
<P>Major Andre him&s;elf neither had, not could have any other &s;entiments of the matter at the time. He, equally with Mr. Smith, objected to the proffe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d a&s;&s;i&s;tance in towing them a&s;hore by the Vulture's boat; he want in his uniform, and empre&s;&s;ed the fulle&s;t confidence in his &s;afety. In all this, did he not evidently act on the principle, and on a firm belief, that he want under the &s;anction of a flag, duty authori&s;ed by General Arnold?</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing then that Major Andre's <HI>printed</HI> letter to General Wa&s;hington, is genuine in every part and expre&s;&s;ion (which however is doubtful); and &s;uppo&s;ing he made the above declaration to the Board of Rebel Officers, and in the &s;en&s;e i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> alledged by them (which may al&s;o be que&s;tioned) yet this cannot change the nature of things. The boat in which he wont a&s;hore, was certainly a flag of truce, and no &s;ub&s;equent expre&s;&s;ion or declaration of his could make it other|wi&s;e. It only &s;hows that Major Andre rea&s;oned ill from unque&s;tionable facts, and admitted con|&s;equences which did not ju&s;tly follow. This could only proceed from the embara&s;&s;ment of his &s;ituation, and of which his enemies, unge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly availed them&s;elves to effect his ruin. The candid heart of Major Andre, was too little ver&s;ed in the mazy labyri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the of deceit, to deal with &s;uch adver&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. The drawing wrong conclu&s;ions to his own di&s;advantage, was a certaine proof of his candour. With men of honour and generous &s;entiments, this &s;hould have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ted in his favour&mdash;with his judges it had the contrary affect.</P>
<P>It would be needle&s;s to dwell minutely on the other circum&s;tances which are adduced by the rebels to &s;upport their charge again&s;t Major Andre, viz. <HI>that under a f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">igned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, and in a di&s;|gui&s;ed habit, he pa&s;&s;ed their works at Stoney and Verplank's Points,</HI> &amp;c. See before p. 10.</P>
<P>I &s;hall ju&s;t ob&s;erve, that the <HI>feigned name</HI> had been a&s;&s;umed by Major Andre, long before he left New-York; and for the the purpo&s;e of carrying <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a corre&s;pondence, not of acting the part of a &s;py &mdash;that the change of dre&s;s, &s;o far as it took place, (for it was only partial) was made by the ex|pre&s;s order of General Arnold, when Major Andre was in a di&s;trict where that Gentleman com|manded&mdash;that in <HI>pa&s;&s;ing the</HI> rebel <HI>works at Stoney and Verplank's Points,</HI> Major Andre did no more than cro&s;s the North River at a common, public ferry, known by the name of <HI>King's Ferry,</HI> where all who travel that way are under a nece&s;&s;ity of cro&s;&s;ing, and near which tho&s;e po&s;ts hap|pen to &s;tand&mdash;and that he cro&s;&s;ed the river there, with General Arnold's pa&s;&s;ports, in the <HI>evening,</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="016731_0017_0F9E702B19E447D8" MS="y">
(when he could not take a view of tho&s;e po&s;ts) merely to return by that u&s;ual route to New-York, being prevented by an accident from returning to the Vulture, as he fir&s;t intended.</P>
<P>To refute the&s;e, and other allegations of the &s;ort urged by the rebels, no more is nece&s;&s;ary than to declare the &s;imple truth.&mdash;Fir&s;t; that all tho&s;e circum&s;tances took place, not only with the knowledge, but by the po&s;itive orders of General Arnold, who commanded in that di&s;trict; which wholly exculpates Major Andre from the charge of a &s;py. I would beg leave to a&s;k&mdash;Did not General Arnold command there at the time? While he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the command, had he not a right to i&s;&s;ue his orders? Were not his orders and authority a ju&s;t warrant and protection for Major Andre! And did they not exclude every idea of a &s;py? However the rebels might di&s;approve of General Arnold's conduct, could this affect Major Andre? When they are engaged in &s;uch a conte&s;t as the pre&s;ent, which threatens this country with utter ruin, and fervitude from France; can they think otherwi&s;e than that &s;ome of their Generals&mdash;influenced by principles of humanity and freedom, and de&s;irous of averting that ruin and &s;ervitude&mdash;will abandon &s;o infa|mous a cau&s;e, and return to their natural and rightful Sovereign, who offers peace, &s;ecurity, and freedom to this country? And is it right, that on the&s;e occa&s;ions, the innocent &s;hould &s;uffer for tho&s;e whom they may be plea&s;ed to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> guilty?</P>
<P>In the next place; that Major Andre neither intended, nor employed, any of tho&s;e alleged circum|&s;tances to &s;erve the purpo&s;es of a &s;py. He did not, in truth, view the rebel army; he did not vi&s;it or enter into any rebel po&s;t; he did not con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> with any per&s;on except General Arnold, to confer with whom was the &s;ole object of his going a&s;hore; neither did he do any thing el&s;e to &s;erve or act as a &s;py. On the contrary, there is the cleare&s;t evidence, that his bu&s;ine&s;s and de&s;igns were wholly different from tho&s;e of &s;pies, and con&s;equently, that he was no &s;py. General Wa&s;hington and the Board of rebel officers were no &s;trangers to that evidence; let the world then judge of the equity of their deci&s;ion and procedure.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only add further on this head, that Major Andre, when returning to New-York, had General Arnold's pa&s;&s;ports, which that officer had certainly a right to grant. Major Andre was al&s;o taken on ground that was alternately traver&s;ed by parties from both armies; and was much nearer to the Briti&s;h po&s;t at King&s;bridge, than to any rebel po&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">II. From the proceding ca&s;e it appears that there was not only much precipitancy in the exe|cution of Major Andre; but a vein of low duplicity runs through the whole of the rebel proceed|ings in this bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>The Board of General Officers did not ab&s;olutely pronounce Major Andre to be a &s;py; but "reported&mdash;that he ought to be con&s;idered as a &s;py from the enemy." When Gen. Wa&s;hington wrote to his Excellency the Commander in Chief, and tran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;itted the report of that Board, he gave "no opinion or determination of his own" on the report; of which Sir Henry Clinton takes notice in his letter to General Wa&s;hington, of <HI>October</HI> 4th; and therefore profe&s;&s;es him&s;elf
<Q>at a lo&s;s what they may be.</Q>
General Green in the conference at Dobbs's Ferry, amu&s;ed Gen. Robert&s;on with delu&s;ive hopes of Major Andre's &s;afety; in &s;o much that the latter wrote to the Commander in Chief, immediately after the conference,&mdash;
<Q>I am per&s;uaded Andre will not be hurt.</Q>
Yet Andre's de&s;truction was then re&s;olved on; and he was executed whil&s;t General Robert&s;on lay off Dobbs's Ferry. Of a &s;imilar complexion was General Green's declaration at the &s;ame conference&mdash;"That the army mu&s;t be &s;atisfied by &s;eeing &s;pies executed:" When it ap|pears from the te&s;timony of &s;everal rebel officers who were pre&s;ent at the execution, and of other &s;pectators, that the rebel army in general was much di&s;gu&s;ted and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed at putting Major An|dre to death&mdash;many of the rebel &s;oldiers melted into tears!</P>
<P>Such duplicity and tergiver&s;ation is very unbecoming men of honour in any ca&s;e&mdash;in &s;o &s;erious a matter, where the life of a mo&s;t worthy, innocent man, and the cau&s;e of humanity, were deeply concerned, it was highly criminal. The guilt on this occa&s;ion was the more aggravated, as the charge was fal&s;ely founded; and tho&s;e who brought it, mu&s;t have known it to be &s;o. Every
<PB N="20" REF="016731_0018_0F9E702BDA30FC90" MS="y">
judicious, unprejudiced per&s;on mu&s;t be clearly of opinion, that General Wa&s;hington and the Board of rebel officers did not, and could not believe that Major Andre was really a &s;py&mdash;unle&s;s it be urged in their behalf, that through habitual duplicity, and re&s;igning them&s;elves to the in|fluence of preju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce and re&s;entment, they lo&s;t, as &s;ometimes happens, the power of di&s;tingui&s;hing between appearances and reality, between truth and fal&s;hood. If they, or their friends, chu&s;e to avail them&s;elve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of this plea, I have no objection; and proceed&mdash;</P>
<P N="3">III. From General Wa&s;hington's letters to the Board of officers, and to his Excellency, the Commander in Chief, it appears that he (Wa&s;hington) had prejudged Major Andre's ca&s;e. In the former, he de&s;ires tho&s;e officers "to report&mdash;the puni&s;hment that ought to be inflicted." In the latter, he tells the Commander in Chief,
<Q>that Major Andre was taken in &s;uch circum&s;tances as would have ju&s;tified the mo&s;t &s;ummary proceedings again&s;t him</Q>
&mdash;that is, would have judi|fied General Wa&s;hington in hanging Major Andre immediately. If this was the ca&s;e, what need of the trial by a Board of officers? Why was that force acted? The commander of an army is certainly competent to order the execution of as acknowledged &s;py. And had Gen. Wa&s;hington proceeded thus &s;ummarily, it had been infinitely more pardonable, than the manner in which he has acted. In the former ca&s;e, he would perhaps be charged with ra&s;hne&s;s and pa&s;&s;ion&mdash;the world will find a name for the latter.</P>
<P>General Wa&s;hington is a very <HI>prudent</HI> man&mdash;he does tho&s;e things with deliberation, which others do in heat. Con&s;cious that the putting Major Andre to death, circum&s;tanced as that gen|tleman was, mu&s;t be attended with much blame; the <HI>prudent, deliberate</HI> General judged it be&s;t that others &s;hould take a &s;hare of that blame. In the Board of General Officers, he knew he had willing in&s;truments for his purpo&s;e; and he thought that blame or guilt, when portioned out among many, like a divided &s;tream, becomes le&s;s. Some people in the tran&s;ports of rage, or di&s;appointment, or on &s;ome trying emergency, will do what they would &s;hudder at in the calm hour of reflection; but commend me as the man, who with affected moderation, &s;teady tranquility, and cool deliberation, can do what no rage, however violent, no emergency, how|ever trying, can ju&s;tify!</P>
<P>It may be fairly concluded, that General Wa&s;hington was unalterably determined on Major Andre's death, from the beginning. He &s;eems to have hurried on the execution, le&s;t &s;omething &s;hould have intervened to thwart his purpo&s;e, and &s;ave that unfortunate gentleman&mdash;the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was an interval of only <HI>two days</HI> between the trial and excecution. No &s;ooner was the Commander in Chief appri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed of the unju&s;t &s;entence deno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d by the Board of Rebel Officers, than he di&s;|patched three gentlemen of high rank in the military and civil lines, to give a true &s;tate of facts; only one of them was permitted to come a&s;hore, and hold a conference of a few minutes with General Green. All that was then urged&mdash;and enough was urged to &s;way any one that was not predetermined, and deaf to the evidence of truth&mdash;
<Q>made no alteration in General Wa&s;h|ington's opinion and determination.</Q>
General Robert&s;on in that conference, and in his letter to General Wa&s;hington, propo&s;ed&mdash;
<Q>that di&s;intere&s;ted Gentlemen of knowledge in the law of war and nations might be a&s;ked their opinion on the &s;ubject; and he mentioned General Kayp|hau&s;on and Mon&s;ieur Rochambault;</Q>
but this was rejected&mdash;the hazard of &s;aving Major Andre by &s;uch an equitable deci&s;ion, was too great.</P>
<P>The Commander in Chief, anxious for the &s;afety of his Adjutant-General, and not appre|hending that his execution would be pu&s;hed on &s;o rapidly, wrote to General Wa&s;hington, <HI>October</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">; and in that letter, his Excellency &s;tated Major Andre's ca&s;e in the cleare&s;t manner, and evinced his in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nce by unan&s;werable arguments; but the <HI>prudent</HI> General neither wanted nor waited for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mation. Major Andre's &s;ervant, who had been a mournful &s;pectator of his ma&s;ter's fate, re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d to New-York, before the letter could be di&s;patched; for as the communi|cation was by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, it was frequently interrupted by winds and tides.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="016731_0019_0F9E702C99963778">In addition to all this, it &s;hould be ob&s;erved, that the report of the Board of officers laid no nece&s;&s;ity on General Wa&s;hington to hurry Major Andre's execution, or to put him to death; he had it fully in his powder to &s;ave him, notwith&s;tanding their report; and there is no evidence that the Congre&s;s interfered in the matter, or gave any order that Major Andre &s;hould be put to death. So that General Wa&s;hington &s;hould be con&s;idered as the MURDERER of Major Andre. This, I may venture to &s;ay, is the opinion of every Loyali&s;t in America &mdash; it mu&s;t be the opinion of all impartial people, in every part of the world, who know or read Major Andre's Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Whatever may be the con&s;equences of Major Andre's execution, (and many that are bad may follow) one is certain&mdash;it has fixed an indelible &s;tain on General Wa&s;hington's character&mdash; a &s;tain which no time can efface. The reflection that he doomed this innocent and worthy Gen|tleman to death, merely to &s;erve the views of ambition and policy, mu&s;t imbitter all his future enjoyments. His name will be tran&s;mitted to po&s;terity with this hateful circum&s;tance&mdash;that he was the unrelenting MURDERER of Major Andre.</P>
<P N="4">IV. It is inconceivable that per&s;onal re&s;entment again&s;t this Gentleman could in&s;tigate Gen. Wa&s;hington to act thus. Nothing of this &s;ort appears; and &s;o far as any thing that was per&s;onal might interfere, the gentle and winning manners of Major Andre would di&s;arm, rather than provoke re&s;entment, had he been a pri&s;oner among the mo&s;t &s;avage of mankind. Some other cau&s;e therefore mu&s;t have operated, and produced &s;o ba&s;e a conduct.</P>
<P>Major Andre him&s;elf has hinted that "he was the victim of policy." But of what policy? Not of any certainly that tended to the honour of the American army, or advantage of the American coloni&s;ts. It was no proof of valour in the former, or that they were engaged in a ju&s;t cau&s;e; neither was the doing an ill and cruel thing any indication of fortitude in their leaders. True valour and fortitude are always generous and humane; cowardice is the rever&s;e&mdash;it is cruel and unforgiving. The tears &s;hed by the rebel &s;oldiers on the occa&s;ion, did them honour, and exculpated them from any &s;hare in the guilt: and after thus &s;ympathizing with this brave man, unju&s;tly put to death, how can they be attached to the leader who is &s;tained with his blood?</P>
<P>With regard to the Coloni&s;ts at large, this affair mu&s;t prove injurious, by its tendency to rai&s;e a &s;pirit of retaliation in the Briti&s;h army. Who can tell what numbers of the Coloni&s;ts in rebel|lion may &s;uffer death on this account, who might otherwi&s;e be &s;pared? An incea&s;ed &s;oldiery cannot always be re&s;trained; to &s;ay nothing of the retaliation which this &s;tep will not only ju&s;tify, but demand.&mdash;On the other hand, much good and many benefits both to the rebel army and Coloni&s;ts would have accrued from lenity, or even &s;hewing ju&s;tice to Major Andre. It would have given ri&s;e to acts of mutual humanity, have prevented the effu&s;ion of blood, and thereby &s;oftened the horrors of this unnatural war.</P>
<P>If then there was policy in the ca&s;e, as undoubtedly there was, it could only relate to General Wa&s;hington. What the object was which this political &s;troke aimed at, we are now to enquire; and probably the letter of Colonel Hamilton (General Wa&s;hington's aide de camp) to Captain Sears, lately intercepted, may lend a clue that will guide us to the true object. Many a dark &s;cheme of policy has been unravelled and brought to light by &s;uch accidents. That letter is dated in October, near the time when Major Andre was executed; it was written by General Wa&s;hing|ton's confidential friend, and therefore we cannot doubt of its containing that General's &s;enti|ments; and it is written to a man who, from the beginning of this rebellion, is well known to have been a tool, employed by abler heads, to carry on the &s;chemes of revolt, and forward mea|&s;ures that were new and difficult in the execution; by bellowing at popular meetings, and pre|paring people's minds for the reception of tho&s;e &s;chemes and mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>From that letter we learn, that the leaders of this rebellion find them&s;elves &s;till in want of many things which are e&s;&s;ential to their &s;y&s;tem, and nece&s;&s;ary to accompli&s;h their purpo&s;e; for the Colonel declares "it is impo&s;&s;ible the conte&s;t can be much longer &s;upported on the pre&s;ent
<PB N="22" REF="016731_0020_0F9E702D5987CFF8">
footing." The articles they have not yet, but <HI>mu&s;t have</HI> &s;oon, are many; though one &s;eems particularly nece&s;&s;ary; and to prevent any alarm by the propo&s;al of it, it is very dexterou&s;ly di&s;|gui&s;ed, diver&s;ified, and &s;huffled in among others which are &s;eemingly harmle&s;s. The Colonel a&s;&s;erts,
<Q>we mu&s;t have a government with more power&mdash;we mu&s;t have an admini&s;tration dif|ferent from Congre&s;s, and in the hands of &s;ingle per&s;ons under their orders.</Q></P>
<P>Affairs in America, are now verging to that point which had long &s;ince been fore&s;een; and which the experience of mankind, in &s;imilar &s;ituations, had taught us to expect. Popular li|centiou&s;ne&s;s has &s;carcely ever failed to end in the de&s;poti&s;m of ONE. This is the natural cour&s;e of things, and is unavoidable. The power that is di&s;per&s;ed among the people, is feeble, becau&s;e it is divided. To exert it with effect, it mu&s;t be collected, like the rays of the &s;un in a focus, and concentrated in <HI>one.</HI> The circum&s;tances which ca&s;ually ri&s;e in &s;uch &s;truggles as the pre&s;ent, point out the nece&s;&s;ity of the mea&s;ure; and this again gradually reconciles &s;ome people, however aver&s;e from it in the beginning; and impo&s;es on others the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, having no other alternative to chu&s;e. This was the ca&s;e in Rome, in England; and it would be the ca&s;e in America, were the pre&s;ent rebellion to &s;ucceed.</P>
<P>General Wa&s;hington has &s;agacity enough to perceive this, and that matters cannot long re|main as they now are. The <HI>prudent</HI> General avails him&s;elf of the confu&s;ions in which he has <HI>kindly</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;ted to involve his country. To &s;upport the pre&s;ent conte&s;t, &s;ome one per&s;on mu&s;t be ve&s;ted with &s;upreme power; a power that will pervade all the American <HI>States,</HI> and call forth their united force; which, in their pre&s;ent democratic, disjointed form, cannot be &s;o vigorou&s;ly exerted. Or to u&s;e Colonel Hamilton's words
<Q>they mu&s;t have a government with more power&mdash;they mu&s;t have an admini&s;tration different from Congre&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>But who can with more propriety, or greater probability of &s;ucce&s;s, look up for an inve&s;titure in that authority, power or admini&s;tration, whether under the name of King, Protector, or Dictator, than General Wa&s;hington him&s;elf? In the&s;e times however, when &s;o many are &s;haken in their attachment to Congre&s;s, by the pre&s;&s;ure of calamities, that are &s;till increa&s;ing; and by the pro&s;pect of inevitable ruin and &s;lavery to America, on the rebel plan; it was nece&s;&s;ary for General Wa&s;hington to give the Congre&s;s, and the determined rebels out of Congre&s;s, on whom he more depends, the fulle&s;t proof of his firm adherence to their cau&s;e: It might al&s;o be conve|nient to create a further nece&s;&s;ity for the office of King or Dictator, by pu&s;hing matters to greater extremities. Now what can be conceived more happily adapted to all the&s;e purpo&s;es, than the putting Major Andre, Adjutant-General of the Briti&s;h army, to death? On this view of the matter, his innocence and rank, in&s;tead of &s;aving him, pleaded &s;trongly again&s;t him; they were incentives to puni&s;h, and in&s;ured his de&s;truction. For according to the well known maxim of the rebels, the greater &s;acrifice a man makes of loyalty, honour, ju&s;tice, gratitude, &amp;c. in their behalf, he is deemed &s;o much the more meritorious, and a truer friend to their cau&s;e.</P>
<P>If all tho&s;e circum&s;tances are duly weighed, compared, and laid together, they will fairly ac|count for the treatment that Major Andre met with; and this inference will naturally follow, that he fell a victim to General Wa&s;hington's ambition.</P>
<P N="5">V. The execution of Major Andre gave general di&s;gu&s;t even to the rebels. It is a certain fact, that many of them have pronounced it a ra&s;h, ill-judged &s;tep; and that the evidence again&s;t him even according to their own account, did not ju&s;tify &s;uch &s;everity. They have al&s;o expre&s;&s;ed their apprehen&s;ions of re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aliation, and other bad con&s;equences, without any vi&s;ible benefit, or probable advantage from &s;uch unrelenting rigour. And although General Wa&s;hington, took prudent mea&s;ures to impart a &s;hare of the blame to others, and &s;hift it as much as he could from him&s;elf; yet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">till he was con&s;idered as the principal actor in the tragedy, and the mo&s;t guilty in this dark bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>The <HI>prudent</HI> General and his adherents were con&s;cious of this, and have u&s;ed &s;ome expedients to ward off the inconveniences that might ari&s;e from it. Among other advocates, a tru&s;ty friend (&s;uppo&s;ed to be Colonel Hamilton) &s;tepped forth, and wrote a letter which was artfully calcu|lated
<PB N="23" REF="016731_0021_0F9E702E2CF8A648">
for the purpo&s;e, and has been circulated by the rebel news-papers, through every part of the continent that owns the &s;way of Congre&s;s <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See a very long letter, which common &s;ame gave to this gentleman, and from many circum&s;tances the pre&s;umption is &s;trong that it was his. It was publi&s;hed in the rebel news papers &s;oon after Major Andre's execution; and gives a detail of his capture, trial, and death; with &s;everal circum&s;tances attending each, which were not known to us before. In general, facts are &s;tated in this letter with tolerable candour, but they are tortured to conclu&s;ions which they will not bear. To give &s;ome plau&s;ibility to his rea&s;oning, this gentleman ob&s;erves&mdash;
<Q>The authori&s;ed maxims and practices of war, are the &s;atire of human nature</Q>
He &s;peaks from experience, and what he has &s;een; having never &s;erved in any war but the pre&s;ent, and in no army but that of the rebels; and with re&s;pect to them the ob&s;ervation is true. But the civili&s;ed nations of Europe, wage war in another manner, and on very different maxims; and I may affirm with General Robert&s;on,
<Q>That no military ca&s;ui&s;t in Europe, would call Major Andre, a &s;py.</Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The letter-writer attempts to ju&s;tify all the proceedings again&s;t Major Andre; he affects to treat with ridicule the arguments that were offered in his behalf; but we mu&s;t beg his pardon for not being complai&s;ant enough to be laughed out of the principles of humanity, ju&s;tice and truth. At the &s;ame time, he &s;ays many hand&s;ome things of Major Andre, and is even lavi&s;h in his prai&s;e. Another letter-writer, who figures under the &s;ignature of Z, and is embarked in the &s;ame de&s;ign with the former, be&s;tows many encomiums on Major Andre; and tells us&mdash; "Ge|neral Wa&s;hington admired Major Andre, and &s;hed tears at his death."</P>
<P>Now all this was to do wonders among the credulous populace. Their &s;cruples and imputa|tions mu&s;t in&s;tantly vani&s;h; for how could they imagine that General Wa&s;hington, who&s;e Aide de Camp, and other friends, &s;aid &s;uch fine things of Major Andre, could treat that gentleman with cruelty or inju&s;tice? Or that he could weep, like the Crocodile, over the victim he had de&s;troyed?</P>
<P>The Letter-writer (&s;uppo&s;ed to be Colonel Hamilton) a&s;&s;erts&mdash;
<Q>Never perhaps did a man &s;uffer death with more ju&s;tice, or de&s;erve it le&s;s,</Q>
than Major Andre. I cannot de&s;cend to verbal critici&s;m; and &s;hall therefore only ob&s;erve, that both parts of this a&s;&s;ertion cannot be true.&mdash; Ju&s;tice awards to every man what he de&s;erves. If Major Andre &s;uffered death with ju&s;tice, he certainly de&s;erved it; if he did not de&s;erve it, the inju&s;tice is evident. This in&s;tance &s;hews how difficult it is even for a man of &s;en&s;e to pre&s;erve a con&s;i&s;tency, when vindicating a cau&s;e which has neither truth nor ju&s;tice to &s;upport it.</P>
<P>But perhaps another a&s;&s;ertion of his may help to clear up the matter.
<Q>Arnold, or he (Andre) mu&s;t have been the victim; the former was out of our power;</Q>
<Q>there was no way of &s;aving Andre.</Q>
By what train of ideas the conclu&s;ion is here connected with the pre|mi&s;&s;es, this gentleman has not been plea&s;ed to inform us. For my part, I can &s;ee no connection or relation between them. Suppo&s;ing that General Arnold was guilty, according to the letter-writer's judgment; was this a good rea&s;on why Major Andre, whom he deems innocent, &s;hould &s;uffer, only becau&s;e the former was out of their power? This gentleman allows that Major Andre did not de&s;erve death; and in many pa&s;&s;ages of his letter, he grant, in effect and by nece&s;&s;ary deduction, that he was no &s;py. If he was not, why was he put to death as a &s;py? Why &s;uffer what he did not de&s;erve? This is what I condemn, and what the world will condemn, as a mo&s;t flagrant piece of inju&s;tice and barbarity.</P>
<P>But ju&s;tice according to rebel ideas, and as applied by the rebel leaders to the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, means no more, it &s;eems, than that one or other of tho&s;e men <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be a victim&mdash;<HI>&s;ic volo, &s;ic jubeo;</HI> and becau&s;e the one, who, in their e&s;timation, de&s;erved to be the victim, happened to be out of their reach; the other, who, in their e&s;timation, de&s;erved it not, <HI>mu&s;t</HI> &s;uffer, as the &s;ub|&s;titute of the former!</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="016731_0022_0F9E702F32BBBB60" MS="y">This, I pre&s;ume, is one of tho&s;e
<Q>authori&s;ed maxims of war, which are the &s;atire of human nature,</Q>

In truth, this gentleman undertook a ta&s;k which was above his, or any other man's abilities, viz. To vindicate General Wa&s;hington from the charge of inju&s;tice and cruelty to Major Andre; and yet do ju&s;tice to Ma|jor Andre.</P>
<P N="6">VI. The letters and proceedings which have been brought to public view in Major Andre's Ca&s;e, throw much light on the &s;tate of things here. Among other matters de&s;erving of notice, we perceive how very different the &s;pirit and principles are, which actuate the Commander in Chief and the Briti&s;h officers, from tho&s;e which influence the Rebel Chief and his a&s;&s;ociate leaders. How &s;triking a contra&s;t is the humane procedure on the one &s;ide, to the outrage and barbarity on the other! The one, pleading for, and a&s;&s;erting the rights of humanity and ju&s;tice; the other, in&s;ulting and trampling on tho&s;e rights! The one, urging that a mutual exchange of kind offices might take place to &s;often the horrors of war; the other, &s;purning tho&s;e over|tures, and per&s;i&s;ting to do what mu&s;t increa&s;e the&s;e horrors! The one demon&s;trating the &s;ince|rity of their profe&s;&s;ions by &s;paring lives that were forfeited to ju&s;tice; the other, evincing their unfeigned malignity, by putting tho&s;e to death who were innocent!</P>
<P>Capt. Robin&s;on, an acknowledged &s;py, was taken, and delivered to the Commander in Chief: General Wa&s;hington reque&s;ted that he might be con&s;idered, not as a &s;py, but a pri&s;oner, and be exchanged; which was humanely granted. We &s;ee the return that was made in the ca&s;e of Major Andre. He was no &s;py; yet contrary in the mo&s;t earne&s;t importunities, and the dictates of ju&s;tice, he was put to death.</P>
<P>The bad conduct of a great number of the principal rebel pri&s;oners in Charle&s;town lately, who were admitted to a parole, might perhaps have
<Q>ju&s;tified the mo&s;t &s;ummary proceedings again&s;t them.</Q>
But the&s;e men, even in an hour of danger, were treated with lenity. Their corre|&s;pondence with the rebel army, and other circum&s;tances, which were po&s;itive branches of parole, and a violation of the laws of ho&s;pitality, as well as of tho&s;e of war, drew from the King's officers in Charle&s;town no other treatment than &s;ending them fir&s;t on board &s;hip, and afterwards to St. Augu&s;tine.</P>
<P>At this moment, there are many per&s;on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> our power, who by the laws of war, might have long &s;ince been ju&s;tly executed.</P>
<P>If the reader would &s;ee another in&s;tance of the humane and generous procedure on the King's &s;ide, let him look into the Appendix that is annexed. A man who has any &s;entiments of delicacy will probably be &s;urprized, that immediately after the execution of Major Andre, Gen. Wa&s;h|ington &s;hould apply to the Commander in Chief, and reque&s;t a favour. Yet this was actually done <HI>four days</HI> only after that tragical event!&mdash;If the mind is di&s;gu&s;ted at &s;uch a reque&s;t under tho&s;e circum&s;tances; it mu&s;t al&s;o be filled with admiration at the an&s;wer that was returned. The neglect &s;hewn by General Wa&s;hington to prior applications from the Commander in Chief, and on a &s;ubject very intere&s;ting to him, would have ju&s;tified the latter in &s;howing an equal neglect on this occa&s;ion. But where the cau&s;e of humanity was concerned, all difficulties in&s;tantly vani&s;hed.</P>
<P>An an&s;wer was immediately returned to General Wa&s;hington's letter; and the a&s;&s;urances it contained,&mdash;
<Q>that Lord Cornwallis would not &s;tain the lu&s;tre of the King's arms with acts of cruelty,&mdash;that his Lord&s;hip is incapable of &s;training the laws to take away the lives and liber|ties of the innocent&mdash;that if any forced con&s;truction be put upon the laws by his Lord&s;hip, it
<PB N="25" REF="016731_0023_0F9E702F99BC70A0" MS="y">
will be in favour of the accu&s;ed&mdash;and that every plea their friends can offer for them, will be humanely heard and re&s;pected </Q>
&mdash;The&s;e a&s;&s;urances, I &s;ay, whil&s;t they reflected the highe&s;t honour on the author, mu&s;t have &s;tung General Wa&s;hington to the heart, &s;ince his own conduct had lately been ju&s;t the rever&s;e of all this; the blu&s;h of con&s;cious guilt mu&s;t have reddened his check, whil&s;t he read them.</P>
<P>The difference, &s;o manife&s;t in all tho&s;e ca&s;es, &s;hould not be referred to cau&s;es that are per&s;onal only; although they have very great weight, as might be evinced, did not delicacy forbid me to enlarge on them. One cau&s;e is obvious, and &s;hould not be pa&s;&s;ed over. The Commander in Chief acts by the orders, and is the repre&s;entative, of a mo&s;t amiable Sovereign, who wi&s;hes to reclaim, and not de&s;troy, his deluded &s;ubjects: His antagoni&s;t is an u&s;urper, rai&s;ed by the caprice of fortune to a &s;tation which he could not have rea&s;onably a&s;pired to &mdash;his conduct is &s;uch as might be expected from that character; and from one who is in the pay and &s;ervice of France;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">General Wa&s;hington is a Lieutenant General and an Admiral in the French &s;ervice.</NOTE> and by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of France, aims at &s;overeignty. The claims of rightful &s;overeigns are founded in ju&s;tice and truth; to a&s;&s;ert tho&s;e claims, they need not depart from the rules of honour and humanity; for the&s;e will be&s;t &s;erve, and are mo&s;t &s;uitable to their purpo&s;e: U&s;urpers invade the rights of others; breach of faith, per&s;ecution, carnag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and cruelty mu&s;t therefore mark their progre&s;s; for the&s;e only can in&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s to their ambitious views.</P>
<P>Every friend to humanity mu&s;t lament that the mild and generous &s;pirit of Government has not met with more de&s;erving objects&mdash;that hitherto its advances towards reconciliation and peace have been lo&s;t on the rebels, who have a&s;cribed them to fear and pufilanimity. In this, they probably judge of others by them&s;elves; for tho&s;e who have no generous &s;entiments of their own, will &s;carcely recognize them in others. With their loyalty, the leaders of this rebellion &s;eem to have renounced all regard to humanity, ju&s;tice and truth; as might be proved by a thou&s;and in&s;tances, be&s;ides the ca&s;e of Major Andre. To tho&s;e who are not acquainted with their principles and proceedings, a ju&s;t character of them would appear little better than &s;atyr and invective. But it may be averred with the &s;tricte&s;t truth&mdash;that in&s;olence in pro&s;perity, or where they have power&mdash;crouching meanne&s;s in adver&s;ity, and duplicity in both, are their e&s;tab|li&s;hed characteri&s;tics. On &s;uch men, there can be no other tie than that of <HI>Fear.</HI>&mdash;Nothing el&s;e can re&s;train or bind them.</P>
<P>Lord Clarendon, in the motto prefixed to the&s;e papers, ob&s;erves,
<Q>that if there were no other brand upon the odious and accur&s;ed civil war of his time, than the &s;ingle le&s;s of Lord Falkland, it mu&s;t be mo&s;t infamous and execrable to all po&s;terity.</Q>
Lord Falkland was <HI>accidentally</HI> killed in battle: Major Andre, contrary to every principle of ju&s;tice and humanity, was <HI>deliberately,</HI> put to death by the leaders of this rebellion; and his character greatly re&s;embled that of Lord Falkland, as it is de&s;cribed by the noble hi&s;torian. How much more infamous and execrable mu&s;t the pre&s;ent rebellion be therefore in this re&s;pect, than the former!</P>
<P>Lord Falkland and Major Andre were both cut off in the bloom of life, and when the highe&s;t ex|pectations were entertained of them. Both were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an uncommon &s;hare of genius&mdash;a ta&s;te for the liberal arts&mdash;a lively fancy&mdash;a &s;olid judgment, improved by exten&s;ive reading. Elevated &s;entiments, an high &s;en&s;e of honour, &s;trict integrity, and a courage bordering on temerity, di&s;tin|gui&s;hed each. An engaging &s;weetne&s;s in conver&s;ation, ea&s;e and dignity of manners, and a mo&s;t o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> re&s;pectful behaviour to others, were con&s;picuous in both, which gained the affection and eff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of all around them. Both were zealou&s;ly engaged in the &s;ervice of their re&s;pective Princes. Lord Falkland hoped that one deci&s;ive battle would te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">minate the calamities of his country; and hence he plunged incautiou&s;ly into danger, contrary to the advice of his friends: Major Andre, influenced by a &s;imilar principle, expo&s;ed him&s;elf too much to an ungenerous enemy. His zeal
<PB N="26" REF="016731_0024_0F9E70305994B4C0" MS="y">
to effect a mea&s;ure which he thought would go far towards terminating this de&s;tructive rebellion, without the effu&s;ion of blood, induced him to depart from the orders of his General, and over|look the danger that threatened. Both the&s;e illu&s;trious per&s;ons fell, equally lamented by their friends, and revered by their enemies.</P>
<P>A few particulars concerning the capture and execution of Major Andre, &s;hall clo&s;e the&s;e remarks.</P>
<P>He was &s;topped, in his return to New-York, at Tarry Town, a &s;mall village on the ea&s;tern bank of Hud&s;on's River, about fifteen miles from King&s;bridge, by three pea&s;ants, who&s;e names were Paulding, Van Wert, and Williams. Major Andre a&s;ked them &s;ome que&s;tions, and their an&s;wers led him to believe they were loyali&s;ts. This induced him to declare him&s;elf a Briti&s;h officer, and prevented his &s;hewing General Arnold's pa&s;&s;port at fir&s;t, which would have &s;ecured him from interruption. The glory of apprehending a Briti&s;h officer, and the pro&s;pect of a high reward, made them deaf to every remon&s;trance&mdash;they carried him to a Col. Jame&s;on of the rebel militia, by whom he was conveyed to General Wa&s;hington. All the particulars of any con&s;e|quence, that intervened between this and his execution, are mentioned in the narrative of his ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Among other amiable qualities, Major Andre had the nice&s;t feelings of honour and decorum. Though perfectly re&s;igned, when his doom was announced, yet he was &s;hocked at the thought of dying on a gibbet. Provided he was put to death, and made the victim of policy, he did not conceive that the <HI>mode</HI> of his death could be an object of any moment to his enemies. Filled with this fond opinion, he wrote to General Wa&s;hington the following letter, in which we re|cognize the delicacy of &s;entiment, and manly fortitude which di&s;tingu&s;hed the author.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BUOY'D above the terror of death, by the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of a life devoted to honourable pur&s;uits, and &s;tained with no action that can give me remor&s;e, I tru&s;t that the reque&s;t I make to your Excellency at this &s;erious period, and which is to &s;often my la&s;t moments, will not be rejected.</P>
<P>Sympathy towards a &s;oldier will &s;urely induce your Excellency, and the military tribunal, to adapt the mode of my death to the feelings of a man of honour.</P>
<P>Let me hope, Sir, that if aught in my character impre&s;&s;es you with e&s;teem towards me, if aught in my misfortunes marks me as the victim of policy, and not of re&s;entment, I &s;hall expe|rience the operation of the&s;e feelings in your brea&s;t, by being informed that I am not to die on a gibbet.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I have the honour to be your Excellency's Mo&s;t obedient and mo&s;t humble &s;ervant, JOHN ANDRE, Adj. Gen. to the Briti&s;h army.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>The peru&s;al of this letter awakens every tender emotion of the heart. The time, the &s;ubject, the reque&s;t, the manner in which it is made, and the per&s;on who makes it, all con&s;pire to intere&s;t us. What mu&s;t we think of the heart that was impenetrable to &s;uch a reque&s;t! And how mu&s;t every feeling of humanity be &s;hocked, when we learn that this la&s;t reque&s;t was barbarou&s;ly refu&s;ed&mdash;this indulgence cruelly denied&mdash;an indulgence which had been granted a thou&s;and times before on &s;imilar occa&s;ions! The letter was not even an&s;wered; and Major Andre was not apprized that he mu&s;t undergo the only thing he dreaded, till the moment he w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed forth to execution! On &s;eeing the gibbet, which was placed full in view of General Wa&s;hington's quar|ters, and at a &s;mall di&s;tance, as if the &s;ight afforded him plea&s;ure&mdash;Major Andre &s;tarted&mdash;
<Q>Mu&s;t I then die, he exclaimed, in this manner?</Q>
On being a&s;&s;ured that his fate and the mode of it were unavoidable,&mdash;"I am reconciled to my fate, &s;ays he, but not to the mode;" and after pau&s;ing a little, he added&mdash;"It will be but a momentary pang."</P>
<P>That dignity and firmne&s;s which accompanied him through every former &s;tage of life, for&s;ook him not in his la&s;t moments. There are many in&s;tances where executioners have been &s;o &s;truck
<PB N="27" REF="016731_0025_0F9E703119A1D420" MS="y">
with the commanding a&s;pect and behaviour of tho&s;e they were &s;ent to execute, that they were unable to do their office. Something &s;imilar happened, we are a&s;&s;ured, at Major Andre's death. The executioner trembled, and was &s;o appalled, that he could not proceed. In con&s;equence of this, an eye witne&s;s relates, that Major Andre &mdash;
<Q>&s;pringing upon the cart, performed the la&s;t offices to him&s;elf with a compo&s;ure that excited the admiration, and melted the hearts of all the be|holders&mdash;in the mid&s;t of his enemies, he died univer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ally e&s;teemed, and univer&s;ally lamented.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the letter before mentioned, &s;uppo&s;ed to be Col. Hamilton's; to which I acknowledge my&s;elf indebted for &s;ome of the&s;e anecdotes.</NOTE></P>
<P>Although Major Andre was thus prai&s;ed by the rebels, (as he had been put to death) to &s;erve the purpo&s;es of ambitious policy; yet this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> not detract from the te&s;timony here given; becau&s;e it was extorted by the force of truth and conviction. His tranquillity and intrepid be|haviour at the approach of death, were &s;uitable to his character and greatne&s;s of mind; and what all who knew him, would naturally expect. For in few individuals were &s;o many amiable qualities&mdash;in few were &s;o many and great virtues, united.</P>
