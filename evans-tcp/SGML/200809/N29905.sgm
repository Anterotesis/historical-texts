Would not this be &s;ordid Ingratitude?</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> The &s;econd thing I would offer in be|half of our Province Bills is this. They have been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nder God the In&s;trument of rai&s;ing all tho&s;e noble Buildings, in the room of which, a few Years ago, were Heaps of Rubbi&s;h, like &s;o many Phenixes out of their own A&s;hes, which would never have been, had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t not been for the&s;e Bills.

<P><HI>Thirdly.</HI> The&s;e, by the Ble&s;&s;ing of God, have paid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ur Expences thro' a long and Bloody War; without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hich we &s;hould never have been able to &s;ub&s;i&s;t: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or <HI>the&s;e</HI> Men face the fierce&s;t Enemies, defy the roar|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g of Cannons and Armies of <HI>Philstians.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fourthly.</HI> The&s;e will feed the Poor, and cloath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e Naked; they will purcha&s;e good Beef in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">epth of Winter for 4 <HI>d.</HI> or le&s;s <HI>per Pound,</HI> Butter for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>d.</HI> and many other things proportionable; and at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">is time they will purcha&s;e Rye for 3 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI> Wheat <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>s.</HI> Corn 3 <HI>s.</HI> Pork, 4 <HI>d.</HI> which, had we Silver Mo|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y, could not be purcha&s;ed for much le&s;s.

But &s;ay Nay; for they have &s;uch a Currency, and &s;o
<PB N="4" REF="039759_0004_1015C12CB3E02E90">
good Credit, and are built upon &s;o &s;ure a Foundation, that this Objection carries no manner of Weight in it. And as to the &s;econd thing, that Provi&s;ions will be dearer, is another fal&s;e In&s;inuation; for we plainly and daily &s;ee, that when Provi&s;ions are &s;carce, they are al&s;o dear; but when Heaven ble&s;&s;es the Earth, and the Earth yields her increa&s;e in a plentiful manner, Provi&s;ions are immediately reduced; and we have from Year to Year been recovering from our heavy Lo&s;s by the late <HI>Canada</HI> Fleet: So va&s;t a number of Mouths more than our own to feed, might well rai&s;e Provi&s;ions, and did &s;o; and ever &s;ince that Fleet have been gone, they have been falling more or le&s;s. And I doubt not, but if the Ea&s;tern Settlements be &s;ecu|red and protected from the Savage Mon&s;ters of the Wilderne&s;s, with the Indu&s;try of our own Country|men, Commodities of all Sorts will be as cheap as ever. And I doubt not, but for Eight Shillings in Bills, you &s;hall by as much Provi&s;ions, &amp;c. as for One Ounce of Silver Money in former times.</P>
<P>But then, &s;ome will &s;ay, upon what Footing &s;hall we emit more Bills? We are very ready to do it, if we can find out any way that may not lead us into wor&s;e Difficulties than we now labour under for want of them. For an&s;wer, fir&s;t, I would propo&s;e, that this General Court do emit Fifty Thou&s;and Pound, more or le&s;s, as they think be&s;t for a Tryal, and let it out at 5 per Cent, as u&s;ual, to &s;uch, and &s;uch only, as &s;hall give Land Security to double the value received, and oblige them&s;elves to pay the Intere&s;t of the Sum taken up in Flax, Hemp, Wheat, Rye, Corn, Pork, Beef, Fi&s;h, Oyl, Camblets, Druggets, Serges, &amp;c. &s;pun and wove in the Province; and that a Trea&s;urer be ap|pointed to receive the &s;ame as it comes in, and to &s;ell it out as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible for ready Money; and that the &s;aid Trea&s;urer be obliged to lay before this Ho|nourable Hou&s;e his Accompts yearly, and give his Oath to the &s;ame.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, that an Act pa&s;s for allowing a con&s;iderable Bounty upon Flax, and upon every Yard

<P>But &s;ome will &s;ay, what if the Ve&s;&s;els and Cargo be lo&s;t, where are we then? I an&s;wer, ju&s;t where we are before.
