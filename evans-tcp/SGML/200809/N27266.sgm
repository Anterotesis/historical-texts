<P>The following brief memorial, of the experience of a deeply devoted mind, is deemed worthy of public notice, as an additional te&s;timony to "the cloud of witne&s;&s;es," we are already favoured with, to the internal efficacy of the power and principle of Truth. The writer was a valuable exam|ple of Solomon's ob&s;ervation, "Honourable age is not that which &s;tandeth in length of time; nor that is mea&s;ured by number of years: but wi&s;dom is grey hairs unto men; and an un&s;potted life is old age:" being remarkably di&s;tingui&s;hed by a &s;teady, uniform devotion, and dedication of heart to the pure cau&s;e of Truth and Righteou&s;ne&s;s on the earth; which he believed him&s;elf called to maintain, and to endeavour to promote by example and precept. His memory is therefore very precious; in particular to &s;ome who had an intimate acquaintance with him. To the&s;e more emphatically, "he being dead yet &s;peaketh," in the remembrance of his &s;olid, wi&s;e deportment, his fewne&s;s of words, and tho&s;e &s;ea&s;oned with grace; and his &s;teady firmne&s;s towards oppo&s;ers of principles and te&s;timonies, which he had not taken upon tru&s;t, but deeply examined their foundation, nature and tendency; and being baptized under a living concern to &s;upport them, as before ob&s;erved, he dared not flinch in the day of battle, but both in that &s;ociety of which he became a member, and al&s;o amongst others, he was deeply and awfully engaged to &s;tand his ground in the divine ability afforded, and to exhi|bit an example of ancient &s;implicity and uprightne&s;s; as he ob&s;erved to a friend in one of his letters, &s;ome months before his decea&s;e. After pointing out his great concern in ob&s;erv|ing the declen&s;ions amongst a highly profe&s;&s;ing and eminently favoured people, and making various remarks on the impor|tance of pre&s;erving as a wall of defence, the religious di&s;ci|pline e&s;tabli&s;hed among them, and not giving way to weakne&s;s, in order to maintain a &s;pecious, merely external unity, and by being indifferent towards tho&s;e noble te&s;timonies which his &s;oul loved, and was uncommonly bound to: he firmly,
<PB N="iv" REF="036346_0003_10091C5D824B1110">
yet humbly, added, "O my friend, excu&s;e my freedom; the cau&s;e of truth I have to believe, though with a due proportion of fear I would expre&s;s it, is &s;o deeply impre&s;&s;ed upon my mind, that neither the fear nor the love of any created being or thing, can be permitted to ob&s;truct or divert me from what may appear to be required of me." In a great degree in this firmne&s;s he lived, bearing much oppo&s;ition, and the cro&s;s&punc; as related in the following memorial; and yet more particularly known to &s;ome who were acquainted with him; and thus firmly he died in great &s;tability and peace, having little to &s;ay, but that little was truly much in a &s;mall compa&s;s, expre&s;&s;ed at different times to a few friends who vi&s;ited him near his end: &s;ome of whom were al&s;o with him ju&s;t at the &s;olemn period: and though in the mid&s;t of mourn|ing, were joyful witne&s;&s;es and partakers of that &s;olemnity and peace, which proved as a &s;eal to the deep concern, exer|ci&s;e, and happy clo&s;e of the dear decea&s;ed. He was ill about three weeks of a fever; and in the forepart of his illne&s;s expre&s;&s;ed to a friend who vi&s;ited him, "that there was no cau&s;e of di&s;couragement to the right minded." Being a&s;ked at another time if he had any thing in particular to expre&s;s to friends, he replied, "No; only my love: all is well: nothing &s;tands in my way." And thus he peacefully laid down his life, in the <HI>30</HI>th year of his age, the <HI>30</HI>th of the <HI>1</HI>&s;t. Month, <HI>1795.</HI></P>

<HEAD>SOME ACCOUNT, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>I SHALL pa&s;s over the early part of my life, only ob&s;erving I had been educated in a religious way. I mention this, as at times, when I lived in London, where I &s;erved an apprentice&s;hip, in the mid&s;t of my di&s;&s;ipation, I frequently felt the reproofs of the Lord in mine heart, but which were &s;oon &s;mothered in the vortex of plea&s;ure. After I had &s;erved my appren|tice&s;hip, I returned into the country to a&s;&s;i&s;t my father in his bu&s;ine&s;s of a farrier, at Reading, in the year 1786. A little time afterwards, as I attended the pa|ri&s;h church &s;o called, where a celebrated preacher of|ficiated, I found an awakening power, which produc|ed not a little alteration in me. I more con&s;tantly at|tended the &s;ervices, public and private; joined the more particular profe&s;&s;ors, and went on for &s;everal years as one of them. I al&s;o ab&s;tained from vain com|pany and conver&s;ation which I had before been ad|dicted to, &s;o that I was one of the chief profe&s;&s;ors; but I found a gradual wearing off of the force of the im|pre&s;&s;ions I had received; le&s;s di&s;like to worldly com|pany; and the power of &s;in gaining the a&s;cendency; that I at times felt much unea&s;ine&s;s; particularly as, on &s;erious reflection I felt the &s;trength of my lu&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ions, and the evil propen&s;ities of my nature un&s;ub|dued; notwith&s;tanding my knowledge of the truths of the go&s;pel, and the profe&s;&s;ion I made: and ob&s;erving and conver&s;ing with my fellow profe&s;&s;ors. I found the &s;ame great anxiety of mind, and breathings to the Lord, that he would make me indeed what I profe&s;&s;ed to be; and what I was per&s;uaded by the &s;criptures of truth, a true Chri&s;tian might be: that is, free from the pow|er, as well as the guilt of &s;in. Thus I went on till about the year 1792, often feeling the dominion of &s;in, and,
<PB N="6" REF="036346_0005_10091C60E12751E8">
de&s;iring deliverance from it; when I was led to con&s;i|der the people called Quakers, and was &s;oon &s;atisfied there was a manife&s;t difference between them and others, even in outward appearance, which when I con&s;idered, I was convinced was more conformable to chri&s;tianity than any others I had known; mo&s;t of whom followed all the fa&s;hions of the world, particu|larly in dre&s;s; an incon&s;i&s;tency I frequently ob&s;erved with much concern. I then &s;ought the conver&s;ation of &s;ome of them, and &s;till found more &s;implicity, more like the precepts and practices of Chri&s;t and his Apo|&s;tles, that I de&s;ired to know the principles from which &s;uch &s;uperior practices re&s;ulted, and enquired for &s;ome of their writings. The fir&s;t book I think that I read, was W. Penn's No Cro&s;s No Crown, which much ten|dered my &s;pirit, and removed &s;ome unfavourable opi|nions I had received re&s;pecting Friends. I then in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;aw how far what I had known before fell &s;hort of what that work directed to; yet I conti|nued attending at the pari&s;h place of wor&s;hip; having the mo&s;t favourable opinion of the mini&s;ter there, and a particular e&s;teem for him, as a man who al&s;o fre|quently profe&s;&s;ed a particular affection towards me. Once I remember, when I had &s;o far deviated from my profe&s;&s;ion, as to go to a hor&s;e-race, he &s;ent for me, and kindly admoni&s;hed me as a friend and over&s;eer. I mention this, as afterwards, when it plea&s;ed the Lord to enlighten my mind more clearly, and con|vince me of the nece&s;&s;ity of leaving the form of wor|&s;hip I had been accu&s;tomed to, it was a &s;ore trial to me to leave him, in a manner that I apprehended he would feel not a little concerned about. The next book I read I think was Barclay's Apology, which opened many things &s;o clearly to me, that I could not but con&s;ent to them; neverthele&s;s there were &s;ome things that at fir&s;t reading I could not a&s;&s;ent to, par|ticularly re&s;pecting public wor&s;hip. I thought it need|ful there &s;hould be a time appointed, and &s;omebody
<PB N="7" REF="036346_0006_10091C62660E4F40">
ready to officiate, that the ignorant might be in&s;truct|ed: and that a man, taught as I apprehended, of the Lord, and properly qualified, might at any time ex|hort or preach to the people. I &s;till attended the old place, going occa&s;ionally to friends meetings on any particular occa&s;ions, when &s;ome &s;trangers were ex|pected; who&s;e te&s;timonies, though I could not but approve of them, yet were not able to draw me from my former &s;ociety; but I found the work of the Lord going on by degrees.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t, I think, I con&s;idered the ordinance of the Lord's &s;upper, as it is called, and was &s;en&s;ible I had never found any profit in it, from the beginning of my partaking of it; and though I had often heard others &s;peak very highly of it, as finding particular and extraordinary comfort and benefit in it; and I often at the time earne&s;tly de&s;ired to find the benefit of it as well as others; yet it &s;till remained a dead, unprofitable &s;ervice: I therefore declined it entirely. The next thing I think I ob&s;erved, was the public &s;ing|ing. I began to &s;ee a great incon&s;i&s;tency in that prac|tice, particularly after &s;ermon. I could feel it had in my&s;elf as well as in others, a manife&s;t tendency to lightne&s;s of &s;pirit, and removing any &s;erious impre&s;&s;i|ons which might have been received from the forego|ing di&s;cour&s;e; that I &s;oon left the place, immediately after &s;ermon was ended. It was not long however before I &s;aw a gro&s;s incon&s;i&s;tency in the practice altogether, when I weightily con&s;idered the matter contained in what was &s;ung, how impo&s;&s;ible it was for a congregation of different kinds of people to join in &s;inging whatever might be given out, whether &s;uita|ble to their conditions or not; much of which, I was per&s;uaded, could not be &s;aid by any, without uttering gro&s;s fal&s;ehoods; which I could not believe could be acceptable in the &s;ight of the Lord. I was in con&s;e|quence con&s;trained to give forth &s;ome ob&s;ervations on the &s;ubject in writing, addre&s;&s;ed to the profe&s;&s;ors
<PB N="8" REF="036346_0007_10091C63F5833FD0">
of religion, attending the place called St. Gile's Church.</P>
<P>"A few ob&s;ervations concerning the cu&s;tom of &s;ing|ing in public meetings of wor&s;hip; by one, who has long been convinced of the incon&s;i&s;tency of it, and now calls upon every one who profe&s;&s;es to be a fol|lower of the meek and lowly Je&s;us, to lay a&s;ide pre|judice, and &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider the following remarks, which are offered in the fear of the Lord."</P>
<P>"Fir&s;t, It ought ever to be con&s;idered, that God is a Spirit, and they that wor&s;hip him mu&s;t wor&s;hip him in &s;pirit and in truth In other words, it is the lan|guage of the heart which he regards, not words, however excellent of them&s;elves. Now I appeal to the witne&s;s of God in every heart, con&s;idering the variety of conditions, the different &s;ubjects, of prai&s;e, adora|tion, confe&s;&s;ion, petitioning, &amp;c. &amp;c. contained in every collection, whether in the fear of the Lord any one, in whatever &s;tate or condition he may be at the time, can with propriety be ready to &s;ing whatever may be given out. It appears to me impo&s;&s;ible that a whole congregation (even if we except the ignorent) can be in the &s;ame frame of mind, con&s;idering the various di&s;pen&s;ations of the Lord's providence to|wards his people; con&s;equently if that is not the ca&s;e, it follows of cour&s;e, that if all &s;ing, &s;ome mu&s;t utter words with the mouth contrary to the language of the heart, which &s;o far from being acceptable to the Lord, I am per&s;uaded is hypocri&s;y and an abomination in his &s;ight."</P>
<P>"Again, it appears to me incon&s;i&s;tent al&s;o with re|gard to the other parts of wor&s;hip; for if the lan|guage of the heart is &s;poken in prayer, which often precedes &s;inging, and which implies a &s;en&s;e of our wants, doth it not &s;hew an indifference whether our prayers are heard and an&s;wered or not, to begin &s;ing|ing immediately, perhaps very different in matter as well as in manner, to what has been prayed for?"</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="036346_0008_10091C6753630728">"Again, after preaching, if the Lord's power is known and felt under the word, is it not more likely to profit, if the mind is occupied in &s;erious meditati|on, than &s;inging, which from my own experience, I can &s;ay, has a tendency to divert the mind from &s;o|lemn, &s;erious reflection? I am now &s;peaking more par|ticularly concerning tho&s;e, who have attained to a mea&s;ure of the grace of God. A&s;k your&s;elves &s;eri|ou&s;ly. Is outward &s;inging intended or calculated to plea&s;e the carnal ears of men, or a holy God? Why &s;uch anxiety about tunes, voices, and mu&s;ic? Is the Lord to be plea&s;ed with &s;uch poor things? Oh, no; you cannot &s;uppo&s;e it. Con&s;ider from what root it &s;prings, from the old man or the new; and remem|ber the axe is laid to the root, to de&s;troy all that is of the earth, of our fle&s;hly nature. I have con&s;idered tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages in the New Te&s;tament, where the &s;ub|ject is mentioned, and am confirmed by them in my opinion, of the incon&s;i&s;tency of public &s;inging. The apo&s;tle &s;peaks of &s;inging with grace in the heart; of making melody in the heart to the Lord; not making a noi&s;e with the tongue unle&s;s that proceeds from the heart; which how &s;eldom it does in public &s;inging I appeal to every con&s;iderate mind."</P>
<P>"I am convinced in my own mind, con&s;idering our &s;ituation here, the power and devices of the ene|my, our own inbred corruptions, that it is more &s;ea|&s;onable to watch and pray, to be ever on our guard, and waiting to feel the light and power of Chri&s;t, to di&s;cover and &s;ubdue the hidden things of darkne&s;s; that as children of the light we may walk in the light, and find the blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, his Spirit and Pow|er, clean&s;ing us from all &s;in; than evidencing that trifling, carele&s;s &s;pirit, too commonly, if not always, attending outward &s;inging."</P>
<P>"I could &s;ay much more again&s;t it, but would not be tedious, particularly re&s;pecting tho&s;e that are with|out. How &s;eldom can &s;uch people, living in open
<PB N="10" REF="036346_0009_10091C6933219D68">
and avowed oppo&s;ition to God, join in &s;inging without uttering gro&s;s, abominable lies: and are we not acce&s;|&s;ary thereto? Is it not expected when a p&s;alm or hymn is given out, all pre&s;ent who are capable will join? Then let it not be &s;aid, how can we help the abu&s;e of it. Ought we not rather to &s;et them an example of truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s, and not countenance any practice that has a tendency to promote lightne&s;s and irreverence? Oh! my friends, this cannot be accept|able to the Lord, who requireth truth in the inward parts. I recommend to your &s;erious con&s;ideration, what the Lord &s;ays in the 1&s;t of I&s;aiah re&s;pecting the ordinan|ces, of his own appointing, when not done in a proper &s;pirit. I perceive every day more and more, an evident departure from the &s;implicity of Chri&s;t. Where is the daily cro&s;s borne? Ob&s;erve the appear|ance of profe&s;&s;ors. What difference is there from the world? Sure, my friends, the&s;e things ought not to be. Bear with me, I be&s;eech you. I am much con|cerned for the honour of our profe&s;&s;ion. If the cro&s;s is truly borne, all &s;elf-&s;eeking and &s;elf-plea&s;ing will be done away, and the fruits of the &s;pirit more evi|denced; which I am per&s;uaded will not be in the pre&s;ent practice of public outward &s;inging, often of words, as to the matter, &s;carce within the bounds of probability: and I am convinced if people would &s;eri|ou&s;ly con&s;ider the manner, it would appear very incon&s;i&s;tent with the gravity and &s;olemnity of the true Chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion."</P>
<P>"May the Lord &s;et the&s;e things home upon every heart, that there may be a concern to offer unto him acceptable &s;acrifice; which more than once is &s;aid to be a broken and contrite &s;pirit."</P>
<P>"Ble&s;&s;ed are ye that mourn," &s;ays Chri&s;t, (not ye that &s;ing) "for ye &s;hall rejoice;" which rejoicing, if it may be applied to the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the church here, I conceive to be a grateful &s;en&s;e of the Lord's mercies; and &s;howing forth his prai&s;es not only with
<PB N="11" REF="036346_0010_10091C6BF53D9BB0">
our lips but in our lives. To conclude, my friends, turn into your own hearts; behold, &s;ays Chri&s;t, the kingdom of God is within you; look not without for what I am per&s;uaded is only to be found within. It is not much hearing or much &s;peaking, that brings true peace to the &s;oul; the ear is never &s;atisfied with hearing. As a proof of that, do not we &s;ee profe&s;&s;ors running hither and thither, as though the more they heard, the better they &s;hould be; encompa&s;&s;ing them|&s;elves about with &s;parks of their own kindling, but what &s;aith the Lord? "Ye &s;hall lie down in &s;orrow." I am fully convinced it is for want of this looking in, and waiting to feel the power of the Lord there, judging and &s;ubduing &s;in, that there is &s;o much talk, &s;o much outward parade, and &s;o little &s;pirituality in the lives and conver&s;ation of the people." J. S.</P>
<P>This I &s;ent to the clerk, at the &s;ame time I &s;ent &s;ome rea&s;ons for the apparent change in me, as ab&s;ent|ing from the &s;acrament, &s;o called; and which I de&s;ired him to lay before the mini&s;ter and others, at a prayer meeting; which he &s;eemed to object to, &s;uppo&s;ing me in an error, and having a very unfavourable opi|nion of Friends principles. I &s;oon after had &s;ome conver&s;ation with him on the &s;ubject; which rather confirmed me in my opinion than otherwi&s;e, his argu|ments appeared &s;o weak again&s;t Friends. Thus I went on &s;ome little time longer, &s;till attending mornings and evenings; but attending Friends meetings in the afternoon. About this time I read Sewel's Hi&s;tory of the Quakers, which I think removed every objection, and confirmed me in my opinion of the truth of their principles. Their &s;evere &s;ufferings, their patience under them, and hone&s;t boldne&s;s before kings and rulers, convinced me, that nothing but a divine pow|er could have &s;upported them. I &s;ought the company of &s;ome faithful Friends, as I could di&s;cover in &s;ome I had been with, little more than the form. I de&s;ired
<PB N="12" REF="036346_0011_10091C6F5AF04550">
to know the power in my&s;elf, and to be truly taught of the Lord, that I might not do any thing by imita|tion, or becau&s;e others did &s;o; but retired often alone, to be in&s;tructed of the Lord, what to do and what to leave; and, glory to his name, he was found of me, and made tho&s;e retirements precious and profitable to me, revealing his will unto me by degrees, as I was able to bear it. I now became acquainted with &s;ome &s;olid Friends, and was occa&s;ionally in company with them, which excited the attention of my friends and neighbours; &s;o that there was much talk about me, and various reports were propagated re&s;pecting it, mo&s;t people thinking it very &s;trange I &s;hould turn Quaker.</P>
<P>About this time I met with a con&s;iderable trial, the death of my father whom I dearly loved. I had long been per&s;uaded in &s;ome mea&s;ure of the vanity and incon&s;i&s;tency of wearing black clothes on &s;uch occa&s;i|ons, knowing it to be only a worldly cu&s;tom: and had often &s;aid to my&s;elf during my father's illne&s;s, I would not put it on for any one except him; but there appeared &s;o many rea&s;ons why I &s;hould conform on his account, that it was not till a little time before his death, that it plea&s;ed the Lord to remove my &s;cruples re&s;pecting it, and &s;trengthen me to bear &s;uch a public te&s;timony, as of nece&s;&s;ity that event occa&s;ioned. And indeed much oppo&s;ition I met with on account of it, but the Lord &s;upported me thro' all. I then con&s;tantly attended Friends meetings.</P>
<P>About this time al&s;o I was concerned to write an addre&s;s to &s;ome who u&s;ually met on fir&s;t days, from different parts of the neighbouring country, to hear the mini|&s;ter, at a private hou&s;e; where I had occa&s;ionally atten|ded, with other profe&s;&s;ors of the town. I al&s;o wrote to the clerk, and &s;ent him No Cro&s;s, No Crown; &s;oon after Barclay's Apology: and to another intimate friend, who was very zealous, I wrote and &s;ent, Bea|van's Primative Chri&s;tianity re&s;tored. And though I
<PB N="13" REF="036346_0012_10091C70DDC6FC60">
de&s;ired in what I wrote to individuals, as well as the &s;ociety, that it might be put about for the peru&s;al of any; I found little notice taken by any, I thought they &s;eemed rather to avoid me. One &s;teady experienced man, in a little conver&s;ation, ob&s;erving, he hoped I did not look for that in my&s;elf, which was only to be found in Chri&s;t, I was concerned to write to him &s;ome little time after on the &s;ubject; and &s;ent him at the &s;ame time, No Cro&s;s, No Crown. While I was exerci&s;ed towards the &s;ociety I had left, I met with &s;ome more trials from other quarters; my relations complained of my &s;ilence, putting unfavourable con&s;tructions upon it. Indeed I had &s;o much upon my mind, that I had little de&s;ire to &s;peak much: for being often in my way of bu&s;ine&s;s with people of con&s;equence in the neighbourhood, mo&s;t of whom had always &s;hewn me much attention and favour, now ob&s;erving &s;uch a change, though only in dre&s;s at fir&s;t, they began to look rather &s;trangely upon me. The enemy of &s;ouls was not unmindful of my &s;ituation, and rai&s;ed many diffi|culties in my way; as the lo&s;s of their favours, and, of cour&s;e, my bu&s;ine&s;s; the great offence my conforming to other things not yet done would give them: &s;uch as the ceremony of the hat, the language, and their titles &s;o highly valued; the&s;e &s;eemed indeed &s;o great di&s;courage|ments, that my mind was at times &s;orely di&s;tre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>I had &s;ome time felt an unea&s;ine&s;s re&s;pecting the performing &s;ome part of my bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;uch as nicking and cropping hor&s;es, &amp;c. puni&s;hing them for the &s;ake of appearance, to plea&s;e the fancies of men. When I began to mention my &s;cruples, much oppo&s;ition was made, as the con&s;equence mu&s;t of cour&s;e be the lo&s;s of much bu&s;ine&s;s. I know not whether I was not too ha&s;ty in this matter, beginning in mine own &s;trength, and not waiting the due time; for I found when I was required to do it, I gave way, which brought trouble upon me; till at la&s;t I was enabled to refu&s;e &s;e|veral, among whom was one for whom I did much bu|&s;ine&s;s,

who on my objecting and telling him my rea|&s;ons, &s;eemed very angry and reproached my chang|ing my religion, &amp;c. He a&s;ked me to recommend &s;ome one to do it, but I told him I could not recom|mend another to do what I thought not right to do my&s;elf.</P>
<P>This event occa&s;ioned &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s; I was blam|ed highly on the &s;uppo&s;ition I &s;hould &s;oon lo&s;e my bu|&s;ine&s;s; but I an&s;wered in the words of our Lord, "Ex|cept a man for&s;ake all that he hath, he cannot be my di&s;ciple." I &s;aw more and more how people could follow the ways, cu&s;toms, and fa&s;hions of the world, and u&s;e means not always the mo&s;t hone&s;t to get its riches: &s;o true is our Lord's &s;aying, "Where your trea&s;ure is there will your hearts be al&s;o." O! how few really deny them&s;elves and take up the cro&s;s.</P>
<P>About this time came the quarterly meeting of a &s;ociety I helped to e&s;tabli&s;h, called The Sick Man's Vi&s;itor, to relieve the wants of tho&s;e in di&s;tre&s;s, con|ducted by the chief and mo&s;t &s;erious of the profe&s;&s;|ors, a committee of whom met every week to tran&s;|act the bu&s;ine&s;s of it, and to hold a prayer meeting as they called it, at the &s;ame time &s;inging, reading, &amp;c. Being the time I u&s;ed to &s;erve on the committee, I took the opportunity to write to them, giving my rea&s;ons why I could not join in the &s;ervices perform|ed at tho&s;e times; al&s;o &s;omething more re&s;pecting the principles, &amp;c. of Friends, with what was upon my mind be&s;ides; ob&s;erving if any were de&s;irous of more information on the &s;ubject, or had any objections to propo&s;e re&s;pecting Friends principles, I was willing to receive them.</P>
<P>Hitherto there had not been any material alteration in my dre&s;s, except what I wore on fir&s;t days; I &s;till wearing a modern hat; but now I found it required of me to make an alteration there; which, as it was more con&s;picuous than any I had made, I found very trying; nature being unwilling to bear the cro&s;s;

but it plea&s;ed the Lord to &s;trengthen me; and indeed it cau&s;ed much gazing, admiration, and ridicule, as I could perceive and hear, though little was &s;aid direct|ly to me, but the Lord pre&s;erved me, and I thought I found rather a kindne&s;s of behaviour among the more con&s;iderable of my neighbours when I attended in the cour&s;e of my bu&s;ine&s;s, particularly from the chief ju&s;tice Eyre, where I had apprehended not a lit|tle di&s;couragement, but I found through the mercy of my God, a very favourable intercour&s;e. And here I may ob&s;erve re&s;pecting the&s;e things, I felt a little at a time required of me; and as I was willing to give up, the Lord was plea&s;ed to afford me &s;trength to be faith|ful to him. Now I am aware the&s;e things, re&s;pecting dre&s;s, &amp;c. are, in the eyes of man's wi&s;dom de&s;pi&s;ed, and thought of no con&s;equence: indeed of them&s;elves, I am per&s;uaded they are of no con&s;equence, or if done from a wrong motive may be rather injurious than other|wi&s;e; yet when the Lord commands, it becomes his creatures to obey, and not rea&s;on about it, whether it is of con&s;equence or not. When I felt a de&s;ire to rea&s;on about it, the example of Naaman the Syrian, was brought to my remembrance. When the pro|phet ordered him to wa&s;h &s;even times in Jordan, his pride and wi&s;dom were offended; he wanted &s;ome great thing done, &s;omewhat pompous, and agreeable to the ideas of his worldly mind; and had not his &s;ervants been wi&s;er than their ma&s;ter, he might have continued in his di&s;ea&s;e; but the event proved, how de&s;picable &s;oever the means appeared, it fully an&s;wer|ed all he could wi&s;h; therefore it is good for any one who feels occa&s;ionally the judgment of the Lord, again&s;t any thing however trifling it may appear, not to con&s;ult with fle&s;h and blood, not to rea&s;on about it, but give up in &s;implicity of mind; and then I am per&s;uaded it will be found of more con&s;equence than was apprehended; for if we are not faithful in the lit|tle, how can we expect the greater will be committed

to us. And indeed in this matter I have been menti|oning, I found not a little advantage; for before, when my appearance was not very different from the world, my acquaintance would enter into familiar conver&s;e with me; which too often had a tendency to divert my mind from that &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s I wi&s;hed to pre|&s;erve, and leave unplea&s;ant reflections afterwards; but when they &s;aw (in their eyes) my uncouth appear|ance, it operated as a kind of check to lightne&s;s, and pre&s;erved me from the &s;nare of unnece&s;&s;ary worldly conver&s;ation; &s;o that I had the advantage of more retirement, which I tru&s;t I can &s;ay I have found the mo&s;t profitable &s;ea&s;ons. The apo&s;tle &s;aith not in vain, "If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him." And a follower of Chri&s;t will not be conformed to the world, nor uphold whatever is of it, either in him&s;elf or others; not merely becau&s;e it is witne&s;&s;ed again&s;t in the &s;criptures, but being influ|enced by the &s;ame &s;pirit, which was in them, he is taught by it to te&s;tify again&s;t the &s;ame the di&s;ciples of old did in their day.</P>
<P>It was a great grief and concern to me to con&s;ider, that as it was a day of &s;o great profe&s;&s;ion, many walk|ing miles to hear, what they &s;uppo&s;ed the go&s;pel, preached, our &s;teeple hou&s;e being generally crowded by people from the other pari&s;hes; I &s;ay it grieved me, that my leaving the fa&s;hions of the world which they all profe&s;&s;ed to deny, &s;hould cau&s;e &s;uch amazement as it appeared to do even in profe&s;&s;ors; which helped to confirm me in my opinion, that how much &s;oever they could talk about religion, very little of the power thereof was known: indeed had I not felt a want of the power of godline&s;s, I &s;hould not have left them, as there were many ties which held me both to the prie&s;t and people. But it was that divine power I longed for; and nothing &s;hort of it could &s;atisfy me, and &s;ure nothing but that could have &s;upported me in the different trials I &s;oon had to encounter; but the

battle was the Lord's, and his was the victory over every appearance of mine adver&s;ary, and to him be all the glory.</P>
<P>For &s;everal months my mind was much exerci&s;ed on various occa&s;ions, the enemy a&s;&s;aulting me conti|nually with reproaches from without and fears with|in. My bu&s;ine&s;s &s;eemed to decline, and I was reprov|ed for over acting my part, and informed that &s;ome of the &s;ociety had &s;aid &s;o. It was great grief to me to ob&s;erve &s;ome Friends, for whom I entertained great e&s;teem, not &s;o faithful again&s;t worldly titles, as <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> &mdash;; Sir &s;uch a one; Mr.&mdash;, &amp;c. as I believed was required and practi&s;ed by ancient Friends. It gave the enemies much occa&s;ion again&s;t me.</P>
<P>About this time peoples' minds were much agitated on political &s;ubjects, the French having overturned all orders and di&s;tinctions, which gave great offence to people in general; they called their days, &amp;c. as do Friends, in&s;tead of the old names. I mention this be|cau&s;e the adver&s;ary a&s;&s;ailed me with the &s;ugge&s;tion that I &s;hould be deemed of their &s;pirit. I could expect lit|tle favour, though politics was a &s;ubject I thought little about, and &s;poke le&s;s: believing as our ble&s;&s;ed Lord &s;aid, "My kingdom is not of this world," eve|ry true di&s;ciple being influenced by the &s;ame &s;pirit, the attention as well as the affections will be engaged in things above, not of this world, more than need|ful; and it had been &s;ome time before a concern to me, to ob&s;erve &s;ome of the &s;ociety of Friends med|dling with &s;uch matters, more warmly than I thought con&s;i&s;tent with their profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I was at times &s;o &s;orely pre&s;&s;ed, &s;o burdened in &s;pi|rit, that I &s;eemed as though my &s;trength was broken, and was ready to cry out, "The children are come to the birth, and there is not &s;trength to bring forth;" but &s;till my de&s;ires were to the Lord, who had hither|to &s;upported me, that I might &s;till experience him a

God near at hand, and not afar off: for I felt how unable I was to move a &s;tep without his divine a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance. So low was I reduced, that though I received &s;everal reviling letters, which were clearly again&s;t the truth, I had not power to an&s;wer them; being taught to leave the cau&s;e to the Almighty, and not be anxious to ju&s;tify my&s;elf before men, but which may be an en|couragement to any who may experience &s;imilar trials, I felt a &s;ecret upholding, a con&s;oling a&s;&s;urance, that the Lord would plead his own cau&s;e, and in his own time bring forth judgment unto victory; and I de&s;ir|ed that his hand might not &s;pare, neither his eye pity, till his work was accompli&s;hed to his own glory, how|ever it might be with me. Thus I continued &s;ome time, till it plea&s;ed the Lord to revive me; when, though I had little bu&s;ine&s;s in compari&s;on to what I had heretofore, yet I was abundantly &s;atisfied with an enlivening &s;en&s;e of the Lord's pre&s;ence; which infi|nitely &s;urpa&s;&s;ed all worldly goods, &s;o that in mea&s;ure I knew the truth of our dear Lord's promi&s;e, that whoever may be enabled to leave any thing for his name's &s;ake, &s;hall receive an hundred fold even in this life, either in kind or in kindne&s;s: and &s;ure the com|fortable &s;en&s;e of the approbation of the mo&s;t High, is of infinitely greater value than any thing this world can afford. O! that the people, particularly the Lord's profe&s;&s;ing people, may be encouraged to be willing to part with every thing, however near and dear to fle&s;h and blood, that &s;tands in the way, which ob&s;tructs that divine communion with him we are taught to ex|pect; for true it is, except a man for&s;ake all that he hath, he cannot be Chri&s;t's di&s;ciple; and he is not a hard ma&s;ter, doth not require any thing to be parted with, but what would really be injurious to our &s;pi|ritual welfare; though to man's carnal apprehen&s;ion it may &s;eem in &s;ome ca&s;es in a different light. Man naturally loves ea&s;e. The cro&s;s of Chri&s;t is not plea|&s;ant

to fle&s;h and blood, but, my friends, if ever we know the truth of what Paul declares, that "they who are Chri&s;t's have crucified the fle&s;h with its affec|tions and lu&s;ts;" and the more readily we &s;ubmit to the yoke, I am per&s;uaded we &s;hall the &s;ooner experi|ence that &s;ubdued, which di&s;likes the cro&s;s: then we &s;hall know what our Lord &s;aid, that his yoke is ea&s;y and his burden light.</P>
<P>A fear had ari&s;en in my mind, le&s;t I &s;hould be be|holding the mote in my brother's eye, and not attend|ing &s;ufficiently to that power, which could alone re|move the beam out of my own; and though my &s;pi|rit was frequently grieved on hearing vain conver&s;ati|on, and often &s;eemed to feel a de&s;ire to reprove, yet I was afraid to ca&s;t a &s;tone, feeling my&s;elf not without &s;in, and I had to remember and to de&s;ire to practi&s;e what is recorded; to &s;tudy to be quiet and mind my own bu&s;ine&s;s; and I think I can truly &s;ay, that in &s;till|ne&s;s and retiredne&s;s I experienced a degree of peace, and I tru&s;t a growth in grace: and I mu&s;t acknow|ledge with humble thankfulne&s;s, the conde&s;cending kindne&s;s of my heavenly Father, in favouring me with much opportunity of retirement; having compara|tively but little worldly bu&s;ine&s;s, for I &s;orrowfully found in tho&s;e lawful engagements, a very great dif|ficulty of keeping in that &s;traight line of duty, which I believed was marked out for me. In the cour&s;e of conver&s;ation words would occa&s;ionally drop, which, afterwards on reflection, brought di&s;tre&s;s on my mind and I de&s;ired to be thankful that I was enabled not to de&s;ire much of this world's goods, but rather the re|ver&s;e, and to be content with food and raiment. It was a concern to me to ob&s;erve among Friends, on a young man's beginning bu&s;ine&s;s for him&s;elf a confor|mity in &s;ome things with the world, I thought to gain their favour and cu&s;tom; it appeared to me paying very dear for their a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and I believed I could

prefer working hard as a &s;ervant, to the mo&s;t profita|ble &s;ituation on &s;uch terms; and fervent de&s;ires would frequently ari&s;e in my mind, that all who profe&s;s to be followers of Chri&s;t, particularly Friends, who pro|fe&s;s more than mo&s;t, would be concerned to practi&s;e our ble&s;&s;ed Lord's advice, to &s;eek fir&s;t the kingdom of God and his righteou&s;ne&s;s; yea and &s;eek nothing el&s;e till they had found it; then I believed by attend|ing to that, they would be divinely directed in tem|poral concerns, and preferring it above all things, would be pre&s;erved from the too prevailing &s;nare of flattering the world for their &s;upport. I have thought that people are often led to &s;uch practices, by engag|ing in concerns which bring extraordinary expen&s;e up|on them; which, requiring more of the things of this world, a greater difficulty is experienced in bearing a faithful te&s;timony again&s;t what they may be convinced is evil. The&s;e con&s;iderations, through divine a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, induced me to be careful of confining my ex|pen&s;es in as narrow a compa&s;s as I believed con&s;i&s;tent with my &s;ituation; and though for many years I had &s;trong inclinations to enter into the marriage &s;tate, I now experienced a check to every de&s;ire of the kind&punc; believing it was my duty to keep my&s;elf as much as po&s;&s;ible from the cumbers of this world, and as a faith|ful &s;oldier to be ready for whatever my great Lord and ma&s;ter &s;hould require of me.</P>
<P>Near the clo&s;e of the year, 1793, I wrote to the Friends of the monthly meeting, to be admitted a member of &s;ociety; which Friends in due &s;ea&s;on ex|pre&s;&s;ed their unity and compliance with: and here I would ob&s;erve, that from my fir&s;t acquaintance with Friends, I could not but approve their caution, in not ha&s;tily admitting any into member&s;hip; differing from mo&s;t &s;ocieties, who, I have perceived, evince a kind of exulting eagerne&s;s in adding to their numbers. And I can &s;ay that I did not feel an anxiety to be re|ceived
<PB N="21" REF="036346_0020_10091C88EEBDA708">
into member&s;hip; but rather to know that power which fir&s;t gathered Friends into a &s;ociety; to experience an union of &s;pirit with the faithful, than any name or outward relation&s;hip: and though a lit|tle before I wrote to the monthly meeting, I had &s;ome apprehen&s;ion of being drawn for the militia, which would probably have expo&s;ed me to &s;ome &s;evere trial, not being of the &s;ociety; yet convinced of the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of bearing my te&s;timony again&s;t wars and fight|ings, I was mercifully enabled to be &s;till, and leave the event whatever it might be, to the Lord, who had hitherto &s;upported me, and not apply for admi&s;&s;ion any &s;ooner on that account.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t meeting for di&s;cipline I &s;at in, I felt a pow|erful concern to &s;peak on a particular &s;ubject, but con|&s;idering my &s;tate of childhood in the &s;ociety, and a fear le&s;t I &s;hould appear forward, I endeavoured to get rid of it, and avoid &s;peaking; yet it &s;eemed rather to increa&s;e than dimini&s;h, till ju&s;t at the clo&s;e, I expre&s;&s;|ed a few &s;entences, and found in a little time the bur|den relieved, at lea&s;t in a degree.</P>
<P>I was often &s;orrowfully concerned to ob&s;erve in the nomination of Friends to quarterly and yearly meet|ings, a di&s;po&s;ition to make excu&s;es; believing tho&s;e meetings were e&s;tabli&s;hed under the influence and pow|er of divine wi&s;dom. I thought if there was a pro|per attention to the guidance of the &s;ame, Friends would be directed in their nomination; that the great Lord of the harve&s;t would choo&s;e whom he plea&s;ed to employ in any particular &s;ervice; and I thought there might be danger in lightly and ha&s;tily making excu&s;es, le&s;t it &s;hould be a di&s;obeying the call of the mo&s;t High. It appeared to me, that worldly concerns had too much influence; that it was con&s;idered whether it would be convenient or not. Now I knew from my own ex|perience, that if an ear was open to li&s;ten to excu|&s;es, enough would be pre&s;ented again&s;t many &s;ervices
<PB N="22" REF="036346_0021_10091C8B68218388">
or duties, as attending week day meetings, and others, in times of bu&s;ine&s;s. But I &s;aw or felt it was &s;afe&s;t and be&s;t to have a &s;ingle eye, to have only one object in view, what the Lord required of me; than to look on temporal concerns, whether it was convenient or not, but &s;imply give up and leave the con&s;equence; and I can with humble thankfulne&s;s and gratitude ac|knowledge the inconveniences or lo&s;&s;es I might have apprehended would be the con&s;equence, were changed into a comfortable &s;en&s;e of divine approbation, and an abundant reward of peace.</P>
<P>The 28th of the 2d month, 1794, being appointed by government to be ob&s;erved as a general fa&s;t and humiliation before Almighty God, and the mayor of Reading &s;ending out a bill, de&s;iring all &s;ects and par|ties to ob&s;erve it as required: I felt a concern to write a few rea&s;ons, &amp;c. why we, the religious &s;ociety call|ed Quakers, could not ob&s;erve it as required; which were copied and handed about in manu&s;cript.

<P>"That the magi&s;trates and people may know it is not from any contempt of authority, nor in rebelli|on again&s;t government, but that they may pre&s;erve a con&s;cience void of offence towards God and to|wards man;"</P>
<P>"Fir&s;t, Becau&s;e we believe that the Lord alone hath a right and authority to enact and require how and when he will be wor&s;hipped. That all wor&s;hip what|&s;oever performed in the will of man, and which the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t doth not lead into, is not acceptable unto the Lord, who hath declared, that in vain do

they wor&s;hip me, teaching for doctrines the command|ments of men;" and that "the true wor&s;hippers mu&s;t wor&s;hip in &s;pirit and in truth." Therefore we be|lieve, that it doth not belong to man to impo&s;e modes and forms of wor&s;hip, and if, in compliance with the will of men, any &s;hould conform to &s;uch pretended wor&s;hip, the con&s;cience not being clear, nor the heart rightly engaged in the &s;ervice, it would be hypocri&s;y in the &s;ight of God, and &s;in to the per&s;on &s;o comply|ing:" for "what&s;oever is not of faith, is &s;in."</P>
<P>"Secondly, Becau&s;e we believe, it is not the fa&s;t which the Lord hath cho&s;en, or will approve of, ac|cording to what he hath declared by the prophet I&s;aiah, and el&s;ewhere, as for a man to afflict his &s;oul for a day, and to bow down his head as a bulru&s;h. And our Lord called tho&s;e hypocrites, who de&s;ired to ap|pear unto men to fa&s;t; and commanded his di&s;ciples to anoint their head and wa&s;h their face, that they might not appear unto men to fa&s;t, but unto him who &s;eeth in &s;ecret; who doth not look on the out|ward appearance, but upon the heart, and who requireth truth in the inward parts. And by the prophet he declared, that the fa&s;t which he had cho&s;en, was to loo&s;e the bands of wickedne&s;s, to feed the poor, clothe the naked, &amp;c. that then he would accept their prayers."</P>
<P>"Thirdly, Becau&s;e it is required to implore the ble&s;&s;ing of Almighty God for the &s;ucce&s;s of our arms, which we believe is repugnant to the &s;pirit of Chri&s;tiani|ty; as Chri&s;t is the Prince of Peace, who did not come to de&s;troy mens lives, but to &s;ave them; and command|ed his di&s;ciples not to re&s;i&s;t evil, but to love their enemies, and to do good to them that hate them. Therefore in obedience to the&s;e commands, through the influence and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t, we cannot willingly think or do evil to any, whatever they may intend to do unto us; but are enabled to

<P>"For the&s;e rea&s;ons, and not from ob&s;tinacy, or perver&s;ne&s;s, or any di&s;re&s;pect to tho&s;e in authority, we cannot keep our &s;hops &s;hut, or in any manner direct|ly or indirectly, uphold or countenance &s;uch a cu&s;|tom."</P>
<P>It is believed by a remnant, who are &s;ecretly mourning for the abominations of the land, and travailing in &s;pirit, that truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s may abound, that there is great cau&s;e for fa&s;ting and hu|miliation before Almighty God; for the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of the people are multiplied again&s;t him, &s;o that there is rea&s;on to expect that the Lord will vi&s;it with his rod even this highly favoured country; and it is their &s;e|cret de&s;ire that as the judgments of the Lord are in the earth, the inhabitants thereof may learn righteou&s;ne&s;s. But, friends, your pretended humiliation for a day, with your lips confe&s;&s;ing your &s;ins, and again return|ing to your old cour&s;e, is only mocking God, who will not hear, though you make many prayers, and cau&s;e your voice to be heard on high, while your hands are full of blood, while you are de&s;iring the de&s;truction of your fellow creatures; for that &s;pirit is not of God, for God is love, and whoever are led by the &s;pirit of God, will love their fellow creatures, and not de&s;ire their harm. Therefore, friends, con&s;ider what &s;pirit you are of, before you pre&s;ume to draw near to the mo&s;t High, who is not to be honoured with the lips, while the heart is far from him, which it is and ever mu&s;t be, while defiled with the pollution of &s;in; but &s;eek for that new heart and new &s;pirit which God hath promi&s;ed; and remember a language of old, to tho&s;e who pretend to honour him with their lips, while their hearts are far from him:

<P>A few months after I al&s;o wrote a few rea&s;ons why we could not illuminate our hou&s;es on any occa&s;ion; as friends, in &s;ome places, had &s;uffered con&s;iderably on that account.</P>
<P>"Whereas we the religious &s;ociety of people called Quakers, are accu&s;ed by &s;ome of being di&s;affected to government, becau&s;e we do not illuminate our hou&s;es, as our neighbours do, on particular occa&s;ions; this is for the information of any who may be de&s;irous of knowing why we thus differ: that it is not from any political motives, nor to expre&s;s any di&s;approbation of tho&s;e who are in authority; but as Chri&s;tians, profe&s;&s;|ing to walk in the fear of the Lord, in a holy life and conver&s;ation, we believe &s;uch &s;uperficial demon&s;trati|ons of joy incon&s;i&s;tent with this our profe&s;&s;ion, on any occa&s;ion whatever; but as it &s;ometimes happens that &s;uch cu&s;toms are in con&s;equence of a &s;uppo&s;ed advan|tage gained in war, we cannot believe as Chri&s;tians uninfluenced by any political con&s;iderations, that there can be any real cau&s;e of rejoicing, but rather of mourn|ing, for the de&s;truction of our fellow creatures, and to lament the prevalence of tho&s;e "lu&s;ts from whence," as the apo&s;tle &s;ays, "come wars and fightings." Profe&s;&s;ing al&s;o to be followers of Chri&s;t, who is the Prince of Peace, of who&s;e kingdom it was prophe&s;ied <Q>that they &s;hall beat their &s;words into plough|&s;hares, and their &s;pears into pruning hooks, that nation &s;hall not lift up &s;word again&s;t nation, neither &s;hall they learn war any more,</Q> we believe where|ever this kingdom is e&s;tabli&s;hed in the heart of any individual, the warring, &s;ighting nature will be &s;ub|jected by the peaceable righteous &s;ceptre of Chri&s;t;
<PB N="26" REF="036346_0025_10091C93DE6B75D8">
who enjoined his followers not to re&s;i&s;t evil, but to love even their enemies: therefore we cannot, with|out &s;ubjecting our&s;elves to the di&s;plea&s;ure of the mo&s;t High, conform to any cu&s;tom, which countenances or upholds &s;uch practices."</P>
<P>"But though we differ from the re&s;t of our coun|trymen, we are not enemies to our country: but our prayers are to the God of the &s;pirits of all fle&s;h, that he <Q>may plea&s;e to break the bow, and &s;nap the &s;pear in &s;under, to cau&s;e wars to cea&s;e to the ends of the earth;</Q> that the people may turn every one from the evil of their ways, and &s;erve him alone from whom every ble&s;&s;ing is received: then would righte|ou&s;ne&s;s and peace meet together, and abound in the earth to his prai&s;e, and to our pre&s;ent and eternal felicity."</P>
<P>I had for &s;ome months, at different times, as I apprehended the concern revive, wrote an addre&s;s to the profe&s;&s;ors of religion, particularly tho&s;e who at|tended the place I had left. Feeling a concern to have it printed, I waited from time to time to feel it clearly, as appearing in public in any manner of &s;uch a nature, was to me a mo&s;t weighty con&s;ideration; I was fearful of moving in mine own will, but at length I apprehended the time come for its publicly appearing, and &s;ubmitted it to the in&s;pection of &s;everal Friends of our meeting, for their approbation of its being laid before the morning meeting in London; being unwilling to move without the full concurrence of Friends. It met with their approbation and con|&s;ent, and it was going to be &s;ent to London, when a member of that meeting happened to come to our town. Friends advi&s;ed it to be &s;hewn to him, who expre&s;&s;ed a fear, that as I was &s;o lately come among Friends, if it was not quite approved of, it might be a di&s;couragement to me, and recommended if I was ea&s;y to let it re&s;t a little longer. I &s;eemed willing to find an excu&s;e, and to get rid of the burden without
<PB N="27" REF="036346_0026_10091C9651ACEED0">
its publicly appearing; and laid it by, not feeling the concern again revive with &s;ufficient power: but I had at times to fear whether I had not too ha&s;tily got rid of it, and let the right time pa&s;s by. May the great Ma&s;ter not impute rebellion to me, but have in this matter, as I have at other times experienced, a gracious conde&s;cending regard to my weakne&s;s; for I have de&s;ired to be made willing to be completely given up to his &s;ervice, and follow him where&s;oever and how&s;oever he may require; the frequent breathing of my &s;pirit is, that the inward ear may be &s;o opened that I may be able to di&s;tingui&s;h between the Ma&s;ter's voice and every appearance of the adver&s;ary, and all willings and runnings of the creature.</P>
<P>In the year 1794, I was at the yearly meeting in London, which held, I think, nine days, and not|with&s;tanding the nature of my bu&s;ine&s;s, I was made willing to give up the time, and have with thankful|ne&s;s to acknowledge I found no lo&s;s, but the invalua|ble reward of peace. Surely the Lord is not a hard ma&s;ter, but whatever is given up under a &s;en&s;e of his requiring, is abundantly re&s;tored, yea as an hundred fold.</P>
<P>A little time after being at an appointed meeting where no regular one is held, under an apprehen&s;ion of duty, I &s;poke a few words. And here I would ob&s;erve, I had long a &s;en&s;e as though I &s;hould have to appear in this &s;ervice, and often felt a word ari&s;e in meetings, but was fearful of moving in my own will, of running before I was &s;ent; remembering the command of old, <Q>He that hath my word let him &s;peak my word faithfully; what is the chaff to the wheat?</Q> I de&s;ired that there might be no mixture, nothing of the creature, but that the ma&s;ter might prepare the offering wholly; yet I often found a &s;imi|lar te&s;timony to what I felt ari&s;e, delivered by another friend. I would willingly have been excu&s;ed the &s;ervice, the pro&s;pect being far from plea&s;ant, at lea&s;t
<PB N="28" REF="036346_0027_10091C99AFFDDF98">
to that which would prefer ea&s;e, yet I was de&s;irous that I might be willing and able to give up to whatever the ma&s;ter required; I &s;eemed only to wi&s;h to know quite clearly, beyond the lea&s;t doubt, when and what to &s;peak. Perhaps I expected a clearer evidence than was meet, or made it an excu&s;e to refrain, till after one fir&s;t day meeting, not giving up to &s;peak a word, I felt the reproofs of the mo&s;t High &s;o &s;harply, till next meeting, that though very unwillingly, and after much inward wre&s;tling again&s;t it, I found it &s;afe&s;t to give up, and was in a degree &s;en&s;ible, that it is better to appear as a fool unto men, than bear the indignation of the Lord.</P>
<P>Some little time after I felt the concern of publi&s;h|ing the little piece before mentioned revive with in|crea&s;ed weight: and after a time I believed it my duty to &s;end it up to the morning meeting of Friends in London, for then <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">pection and judgment re&s;pecting printing it; which I did, under the title of "Rea&s;ons for leaving the national e&s;tabli&s;hed mode of wor&s;hip; more particularly addre&s;&s;ed to tho&s;e who attend at the place called St. Giles's Church Reading:" accom|panied with a few lines to the meeting, from friends of our own, which the meeting with a few alterations approved of, and left me at liberty to print it.

<P>"There is a little matter I have for &s;ome time felt a de&s;ire to call thy &s;erious attention to. Not long &s;ince, part of the goods of &s;ome of thy peaceable neighbours were taken away by force, for the repair|ing, I apprehend, the place where thy congregation meet to wor&s;hip I have been led to con&s;ider the incon&s;i&s;tency of this practice with the &s;pirit of the go&s;pel, of which thou art e&s;teemed a mini&s;ter. I have examined the Scriptures of Truth, and do not find that either Chri&s;t or his apo&s;tles ever u&s;ed, or taught &s;uch a practice, to oblige tho&s;e to &s;upport them, or their places of wor&s;hip, who did not receive them. "As ye would that men &s;hould do unto you," &s;aid our Lord, "do ye even &s;o unto them," for this "is the law and the prophets," Now I am much inclined to think, if thou wilt calmly and weightily con&s;ider this matter, a deviation from this important injunction will appear. If this people had the powers of the earth on their &s;ide (as thou ha&s;t in the&s;e matters)
<PB N="30" REF="036346_0029_10091C9E990DC1E0">
and in&s;i&s;ted upon thy helping to &s;upport their place of wor&s;hip, where thou had&s;t a con&s;cientious objection to go, would&s;t not thou think it unrea&s;onable; and rather that every &s;ociety &s;hould &s;upport its own mini&s;ters and places of wor&s;hip? And truly there are tho&s;e who from a real con&s;cientious &s;cruple, cannot willingly uphold tho&s;e called pari&s;h churches. I have felt it my&s;elf, and expect I can if thou require it, advance &s;ome weighty rea&s;ons for &s;o doing; at pre&s;ent my regard for thee induces me to pre&s;s a &s;erious exami|nation of this matter; and I feel a de&s;ire that cu&s;toms originating in the times of ignorance and &s;uper&s;tition, and the more powerful motive of intere&s;t it&s;elf, may not induce thee to contemn the &s;imple, yet I hope &s;incere, repre&s;entations of the mean and de&s;pi&s;ed.</P>
<P>"Now this I do not write from any de&s;ire to avoid &s;uffering for prai&s;ed be the Lord, there is a remnant at this day, who are enabled to take joyfully the &s;poil|ing of their goods for a good con&s;cience &s;ake, in &s;up|porting their te&s;timonies again&s;t what they believe to be repugnant to the &s;pirit of the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation."</P>

<P>"<LABEL>P. S.</LABEL> As thou de&s;ired, I &s;end thy account; and here it may be proper to remark, that I cannot &s;uffer thy demand to be paid thereby. Thou, perhaps wilt think me trouble&s;ome and impertinent, but the Lord knoweth my heart in this matter, that it is from a per&s;ua&s;ion of duty towards him and not from a perver&s;ene&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition, as men may &s;up|po&s;e it is."</P>
<P>I found a &s;pirit generally prevail among them, both preachers and hearers, confident in their own opini|on, and condemning without hearing the &s;entiments of others. Oh! how doth my &s;pirit mourn for them, under a &s;en&s;e of the danger of their &s;ituation and a per&s;ua&s;ion of the applicablene&s;s of an ancient language, "The prophets prophe&s;y fal&s;ely, the prie&s;ts bear rule by their means, and the people love to have it &s;o; but what will they do in the end thereof!"</P>
<P>Being appointed by the pari&s;h, over&s;eer this year, I had frequent opportunities of ob&s;erving the difficulties many of the poor laboured under, and was favoured to &s;ympathize with them therein; and I had often to con&s;ider the manner of living among th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">e in &s;uperior &s;ituations, as to outward things, and it appeared to me incon&s;i&s;tent with the gracious de&s;igns of our hea|venly Father, that &s;ome &s;hould live luxuriou&s;ly, and expend much upon &s;uperfluities, while &s;o many fellow-creatures were in want of the comforts and nece&s;&s;aries of life.

<HEAD>A few &s;erious QUERIES and OBSERVATIONS, Addre&s;&s;ed to the high profe&s;&s;ors of religion in this day, by one who was long in the profe&s;&s;ion, but knew not the power, till it plea&s;ed the Lord, by the mini&s;try and writings of the people called Qua|kers, to direct him where alone the power is to be known, <HI>within.</HI></HEAD>
<P>What is a true Chri&s;tian?</P>
<P>Is it one who a&s;&s;ents to and believes certain facts, as recorded in holy writ, and forms certain principles and opinions thereupon; producing perhaps a partial reformation, an ab&s;taining from the gro&s;&s;er pollutions of &s;in, but denying the po&s;&s;ibility of a total clean&s;ing and freedom from &s;in in this world? Or is it one who knows not in word only, but in deed and in truth, a death unto &s;in, and a new birth unto righteou&s;ne&s;s;
<PB N="34" REF="036346_0033_10091CA8692D0BD0">
a being born again, not of blood, nor of the will of the fle&s;h, nor of man, but of God? "For," &s;ays our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, "except a man be born again, he can|not enter into the kingdom of God." A man may know with Nicodemus, and confe&s;s, that Chri&s;t is a teacher &s;ent from God, he may be able to talk much about the doctrines of the go&s;pel, and fancy him&s;elf &s;ecure by imputation, but what has this to do with the new birth &s;o e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary? What can all his wi&s;dom and under&s;tanding teach him. Nay, he cannot come into the new birth till all is parted with. The very nature of the thing implies a beginning again, a life as different from his former as light from darkne&s;s. "Ye were &s;ometimes darkne&s;s," &s;ays Paul, "but now are ye light in the Lord." Now he who knows this new birth, not a change of opinion, not a comprehending the truths of the go&s;pel in his under&s;tanding, or joining this or that &s;ociety, but who knows the thing it&s;elf; not the name, not the imaginations concerning it, but the nature, the life, the e&s;&s;ence; will &s;uch a man be like what he was before?</P>
<P>The forerunner of our Lord expres&s;ly told his hear|ers, when preparing them for the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation, "The axe is laid to the root of the trees, and every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and ca&s;t into the fire." What tree and what root is there meant? Is it outward or inward? Who can an&s;wer that, but he who hath felt the axe, and the de&s;truction, in a mea&s;ure of the corrupt tree? "His fan is in his hand, he adds, and he will thoroughly purge his floor;" (mark "thoroughly,") what will remain then? O! that profe&s;&s;ors were concerned to know, and willing to part with all that &s;tands in the way, that they may know indeed what it is to be thoroughly purged, in&s;tead of denying the po&s;&s;ibility of it; for it is a dreadful thing to oppo&s;e or deny the pow|er of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="036346_0034_10091CAA0CC50B00">Chri&s;t &s;aid, "Ble&s;&s;ed are the pure in heart;" but modern Chri&s;tians, as they would be thought, &s;ay, there is no purity of heart, but it is and mu&s;t remain deceitful above all things and de&s;perately wicked? Again it is &s;aid, "who brings a clean thing out of an unclean?" That the heart is naturally unclean is allowed, but hath not the Lord promi&s;ed to clean&s;e his people from all their uncleanne&s;s, mark all, what uncleanne&s;s will then remain? Some attempt to excu&s;e them&s;elves by what Paul once ex|perienced; "The fle&s;h lu&s;teth again&s;t the &s;pirit, and the &s;pirit again&s;t the fle&s;h; a law in the members warring again&s;t the law of the mind." That Paul once felt that is allowed, but did he not after &s;ay, "There is no condemnation to them that are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who walk not after the fle&s;h but after the &s;pirit;" and did he not &s;ay, "The law of the &s;pirit of life had made him free from the law of &s;in; and how could they who were dead unto &s;in live any longer therein?" Doth he not again &s;ay, "I am dead with Chri&s;t, neverthele&s;s I live, yet not I, (not natural &s;inful &s;elf,) but Chri&s;t liveth in me?" "I will dwell in them and walk in them &s;aith the Lord;" and will the Lord dwell in an unholy place? As &s;oon would light dwell with darkne&s;s. Satan can indeed transform him&s;elf into an angel of light, yea, he, as God, &s;itteth in the temple of God, &s;hewing him&s;elf that he is God. The imagining part in man is &s;ure to be deceived, and wor&s;hip the appearance in&s;tead of the reality, for the world by wi&s;dom, man by his natural or humanly acquired abilities, knew not, nor ever can know God. "If any man, &s;ays Paul, will be wi&s;e, let him fir&s;t become a fool," that his old eye may be clo&s;ed, and the new eye, which alone can di&s;cern the things of God, may be opened.</P>
<P>Again, Chri&s;t &s;aith, "Be ye perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect." But modern
<PB N="36" REF="036346_0035_10091CAD8B5060A8">
Chri&s;tians, as they call them&s;elves, &s;ay there is no &s;uch thing as perfection. O that they would con&s;ider whom they oppo&s;e by &s;o &s;aying.</P>
<P>Doth not Paul de&s;ire tho&s;e he was writing to, to clean&s;e them&s;elves from all filthine&s;s of fle&s;h and &s;pirit, perfecting holine&s;s in the fear of the Lord; and pray that others may be perfect and complete in all the will of God? What does &s;uch plain expre&s;s language mean? O the &s;ubtility of that &s;erpent, who can rea|&s;on and argue the true meaning away; and O the lamentable e&s;tate of tho&s;e that are &s;o deceived by him, who are &s;itting down at ea&s;e, with the vain imagina|tion that what Chri&s;t hath done, as they &s;uppo&s;e for them, will be &s;ufficient; without experiencing the work in them; who having eyes &s;ee not, and ears hear not, in the true &s;piritual &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>Again, Chri&s;t &s;aith, "Swear not at all;" but modern Chri&s;tians &s;ay, We may &s;wear in &s;ome ca&s;es. We will rea&s;on about Chri&s;t's words, and judge our|&s;elves what they mean; how far they are to be obeyed or not. Tho' James &s;ays, "Above all things, my brethren, &s;wear not." Yet ye &s;ay, We may &s;wear &s;uch and &s;uch oaths, O poor Chri&s;tendom, how is thy gold become dim!</P>
<P>Again, Chri&s;t &s;aith, "Who&s;oever he be of you that for&s;aketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my di&s;ciple; but now Chri&s;tians can keep all; their own wi&s;dom, their own wills, the favour of the world, its riches and friend&s;hips, its fa&s;hions and cu&s;toms; though our Lord &s;aith, "Whoever is the friend of the world, is the enemy of God;" and Paul &s;ays, "If I yet plea&s;e them, I am not the &s;ervant of Chri&s;t."</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>FRIENDS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>My mind hath been much exerci&s;ed at times, &s;ince I &s;eparated from your communion, with de&s;ires for your real advancement in the &s;pirit and power of that religion you make profe&s;&s;ion of; and being per|&s;uaded there are tho&s;e among you who do really de&s;ire to know the truth, I feel a renewed concern to &s;alute the&s;e, in a degree I hope, of true go&s;pel love; and to offer to your &s;erious con&s;ideration, the rea&s;ons which induced me to &s;eparate from your &s;ociety. And truly, friends, there were many ties, which nearly united me to you; and very unwilling I was for a con&s;iderable time, to believe that tho&s;e things I had been engaged in, and &s;o highly e&s;teemed, were not what they had appeared to be; but, as I earne&s;tly de&s;ired to know the truth, whatever it might co&s;t me, I felt the axe laid to the root of the tree, and the fine buildings and plau&s;ible appearances were &s;haken. I became &s;en&s;ible, that the tree mu&s;t fir&s;t be made good, before the fruit could be good; a doctrine e&s;&s;entially different from what I had heard of men; even of men highly e&s;teemed; by whom I was taught, that deli|verance from &s;in is not to be expected in this life; and
<PB N="38" REF="036346_0037_10091CB2981AAB68">
was hearing day after day, the uniform acknow|ledgement of 'being mi&s;erable &s;inners, having no health,' &amp;c. which I found, by the manife&s;tations of that &s;pirit which "is given to every man to profit withal," 1 Cor. xii. 7, and which di&s;covers the &s;ecret things of darkne&s;s, to be not agreeable, but contrary, to the &s;criptures of truth; which expre&s;sly declare, that the great Author of the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation "came to &s;ave his people <HI>from</HI> their &s;ins," Matt. i. 21, and <HI>not in them:</HI> a very e&s;&s;ential difference. This I be|lieved mu&s;t be experimentally known, feeling &s;in to be the great di&s;ea&s;e of the &s;oul, the alone cau&s;e of &s;eparation from the Mo&s;t High, in whom alone true happine&s;s is found. I was &s;en&s;ible that while &s;in remained, the &s;eparation mu&s;t continue, there being "no communion between light and darkne&s;s, righ|teou&s;ne&s;s and unrighteou&s;ne&s;s;" 2 Cor. vi. 14, nor could that gracious promi&s;e be fulfilled," I will dwell in them, and walk in them, I will be their God, and they &s;hall be my people;" 2 Cor. vi. 16, for the apo&s;tle &s;ays, "ye are the temple of God, and the temple of God is holy." 1 Cor. iii. 17.</P>
<P>Further, John the Bapti&s;t, who was &s;ent to prepare the way of the Lord, de&s;cribing the nature and effects of his ma&s;ter's kingdom, &s;ays, "Now (mark now) is the axe laid to the root of the tree; every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit, is hewn down, and ca&s;t into the fire." Mat. iii. 10. This is a lan|guage &s;urely implying a complete, effectual clean&s;ing from all the pollutions of &s;in, even now in this life. Our Lord him&s;elf uniformly, in all his di&s;cour&s;es, inculcated this doctrine. In that mo&s;t excellent &s;er|mon on the Mount, Matt. v. 6.7, he in&s;i&s;ts on the nece&s;&s;ity of a righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;uperior to that of the law; for &s;ays he, "except your righteou&s;ne&s;s exceed the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Scribes and Phari&s;ees, ye &s;hall in no ca&s;e enter into the kingdom of heaven."
<PB N="39" REF="036346_0038_10091CB65CDE1748">
What language can be plainer? And that he did not mean an imaginary, merely imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s, as I fear, many vainly &s;uppo&s;e, is evident from the conclu&s;ion; where he draws the compari&s;on between tho&s;e who hear, and do his &s;ayings, and them who hear, and do them not; thereby fully e&s;tabli&s;hing the po&s;&s;ibility of doing them. And if due attention is paid to every part of that di&s;cour&s;e, I think it mu&s;t be obvious, that they who are of the happy number, who not only hear, but do tho&s;e &s;ayings, and who our Lord likens to a building upon a rock, on which they are able to with&s;tand all oppo&s;ition; will not be mi&s;erable &s;inners, doing what they ought not to do, having no health in them; &amp;c. but will know a righ|teou&s;ne&s;s wrought in them far &s;uperior to that of the law. For, as the law, the outward law, written on tables of &s;tone, took cognizance of outward actions; the law of Chri&s;t, written as the apo&s;tle &s;ays, in the fle&s;hly tables of the heart, reaches to the root, and &s;ource of action: for, whereas the law &s;aid, "thou &s;halt not kill." Chri&s;t forbids being angry without cau&s;e. Again, the law &s;aid, "Thou &s;halt not commit adultery; Chri&s;t forbids lu&s;t, thus &s;triking at the root. The cau&s;e being removed, the con&s;equence or effect mu&s;t unavoidably be done away. Once more, the law &s;aid, "Thou &s;halt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy; an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth." Chri&s;t &s;ays, "Re&s;i&s;t not evil, love your enemies, do good to them that hate you;" with much more of like import, which many who profe&s;s to follow him, &s;eem to pay very little attention to; as though it was an indifferent matter, whether they do them or not. But it may be well for &s;uch to con&s;ider whether our Lord would have &s;aid, "Be ye perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect," if he did not mean they &s;hould be &s;o; and whether they who do as he there exhorts, will not be perfect. I

cannot conceive how it is po&s;&s;ible to deduce any other inference without gro&s;sly wre&s;ting the &s;cripture. "Ye are my friends," &s;aid he, at another time, "if ye do what&s;oever I have commanded you," John xv. 14. "He that loveth me keepeth my commandments," John xiv. 21. "Not every one that &s;aith unto me Lord, Lord, (that call me ma&s;ter and honour me with their lips), &s;hall enter into the kingdom of hea|ven, but he that doeth the will of my Father, which is in heaven," Matt. vii. 21. "If ye know the&s;e things happy are ye if he do them," John xiii. 17. For if the &s;imple belief of Chri&s;t's &s;ufferings, re&s;ur|rection, &amp;c. be &s;ufficient to &s;ave; to what purpo&s;e was all his di&s;cour&s;es, wherein he repeatedly in&s;i&s;ts upon the nece&s;&s;ity of regeneration, a being born again; which certainly implies &s;omething more than a change of opinion, a per&s;ua&s;ion of the judgment, and a par|tial reformation. For as he &s;aid to Nicodemus, "That which is born of the fle&s;h, is fle&s;h&punc; and that which is born of the &s;pirit, is &s;pirit," John iii. 6. it obviou&s;ly follows, that they who are really born of the &s;pirit, will be of the &s;ame nature as the &s;pirit. Old things will be pa&s;&s;ed away, and all things become new, and all of God. "A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump," Luke xiii. 21. "New wine mu&s;t be put into new bottles." Mark ii. 22; with many other &s;imilitudes, plainly implying the nece&s;&s;ity of a total, effectual change. Again to confirm this great and nece&s;&s;ary truth, of freedom from &s;in, he &s;ays to his di&s;ciples, "if ye continue in my word, then are ye my di&s;ciples indeed, and ye &s;hall know the truth, and the truth &s;hall make you free," and, to reprove their carnal ideas of a temporal outward freedom, he adds, "He that committeth &s;in, is the &s;ervant of &s;in," and if the Son &s;hall make you free, ye &s;hall be free indeed," John viii. 31, &amp;c. That this freedom from &s;in, even from the power, as well as the guilt, is to
<PB N="41" REF="036346_0040_10091CBA58A91088">
be known in this life, is certified again, by his &s;aying of tho&s;e who die in their &s;ins, "Whither I go, ye cannot come," John viii. 21. Now if deliverance from &s;in is not known in this life, we mu&s;t of ne|ce&s;&s;ity die in our &s;ins. Therefore it matters not what knowledge a man hath, what is his faith, or what profe&s;&s;ion he hath made, if he hath not known deli|verance from &s;in. This is a point &s;o important, and a mi&s;take therein liable to &s;uch baneful con&s;equences, that I am induced to dwell upon it, knowing from my own experience, how prevailing is the contrary opinion. Nor is it &s;trange, that people &s;hould prefer and indulge the notion of the po&s;&s;ibility of deliverance from the guilt and puni&s;hment of &s;in, without the power thereof being &s;ubdued. We naturally love ea&s;e, an ea&s;e which the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t is decidedly again&s;t. So clo&s;e does it apply, that it is, in our Lord's own words, as cutting off a right hand, and plucking out a right eye. Matt. vi. 29, 30. "Who&s;oever," &s;ays he, again and again, "doth not bear his cro&s;s, and come after me, cannot be my di&s;ciple," Luke xiv. 27: The apo&s;tle bears te&s;timony to this important truth, where he &s;ays, "They that are Chri&s;t's, have crucified the fle&s;h with its affections and lu&s;ts." Gal. v.xxiv. Surely if lu&s;ts and affections, the very root and &s;eed of &s;in, are &s;lain, what can remain thereof? In another place he &s;ays, "How &s;hall we, that are dead to &s;in, live any longer therein?" Rom. vi. 2. Another apo&s;tle &s;ays, Who&s;oever is born of God, doth not commit &s;in, for his &s;eed remaineth in him, and he cannot &s;in, becau&s;e he is born of God." 1 John iii. 9.</P>
<P>I have produced a few plain pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, to &s;hew the ground or cau&s;e of my &s;eparation; that deliverance from &s;in, a being clean&s;ed from all defile|ment thereof in this life, is not only po&s;&s;ible, but in|di&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary; and that the contrary doctrine is fundamentally erroneous; as it &s;ets up the &s;hadow
<PB N="42" REF="036346_0041_10091CBBF98E0A10">
in&s;tead of the &s;ub&s;tance, an imaginary, in&s;tead of a real, holine&s;s. I may probably make &s;ome more ob|&s;ervations on this mo&s;t important point, as I proceed. I &s;hall now offer a few remarks on &s;ome of the &s;ervices u&s;ually performed; comparing them al&s;o with the &s;criptures of truth, which mo&s;t profe&s;&s;ors acknow|ledge to be the &s;tandard or rule; from which com|pari&s;on they clearly appear to me, not to be what many call them, 'means of grace and ordinances of God; but the mere inventions of man, &s;et up in his own fallen wi&s;dom, as a &s;ub&s;titute for the life and power, which were lo&s;t in a long dark night of apo&s;ta|cy: not the true wor&s;hip of God, but &s;uch bodily exerci&s;e as the apo&s;tle &s;ays, "profiteth little, 1 Tim. iv. 8. For be it remembered, the great Author of the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation, expre&s;sly declared, "that the true wor&s;hippers &s;hall wor&s;hip the Father in &s;pirit and in truth." John iv. 23. And the apo&s;tle confirms it, by &s;aying, 'We know not what we &s;hould pray for, as we ought; but the &s;pirit helpeth our infirmities, and maketh interce&s;&s;ion for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. Rom. vii. 26. Therefore, as this nece&s;&s;ary a&s;&s;i&s;tance is not at our command, for people to pretend to wor&s;hip the Mo&s;t High in a pre&s;cribed form, or in the &s;tudied or extempore productions of their own natural or acquired abilities, in their own wills, and their own time, without waiting to feel the influences and movings of the Holy Spirit, in and through which alone true wor&s;hip can be performed, appears to me nothing better, whatever it may be called, than <HI>will-wor&s;hip.</HI> The &s;criptures al&s;o repeat|edly mention a growing in grace, 2 Pet. iii. 18, a going on unto perfection, Heb. vi. 1. How incon|&s;i&s;tence then is the repeated uniform acknowledgement, "We are mi&s;erable &s;inners, doing what we ought not to do, having no health in us," &amp;c? Doth it not obviou&s;ly confe&s;s, if the truth is &s;poken, that no
<PB N="43" REF="036346_0042_10091CBD86E4B988">
benefit hath been received, notwith&s;tanding the fre|quent (as it is pretended) waiting upon the Lord? But if it is true, as the &s;criptures declare, that Chri&s;t came to '&s;ave his people from their &s;ins;' they who make that confe&s;&s;ion, acknowledge they are not of that number; for if they are mi&s;erable &s;inners, they certainly are not &s;aved from their &s;ins, however they may attempt to reconcile &s;o plain a contradiction. This is a language not confined to a particular part of the &s;ervice; the incon&s;i&s;tency of the whole appears equal|ly obvious; as at one time confe&s;&s;ing their &s;ins and wickedne&s;&s;es; then called upon to addre&s;s the mo&s;t High, with pure, humble, penitent, and obedient hearts; one while returning thanks for creation, pre|&s;ervation, and redemption; again acknowledging having erred and &s;trayed like lo&s;t &s;heep, de&s;iring to &s;hew forth his prai&s;e not only with their lips, but in their lives, by giving them&s;elves up to his &s;ervice, and walking before him in holine&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s all their days; but &s;till mi&s;erable &s;inners, doing what they ought not to do, &amp;c. Can this running back|wards and forwards, one time &s;aying one thing, ano|ther time quite the contrary, be acceptable &s;ervice to that God, who &s;earcheth the heart, trieth the reins, and requireth truth in the inward parts? Again, in repeating the experiences of the royal P&s;almi&s;t, how is it po&s;&s;ible but many gro&s;s fal&s;ehoods mu&s;t be expre&s;&s;|ed? For if the words of the mouth do not expre&s;s the real experimental language of the heart, however excellent they may be, yet they are to tho&s;e who utter them, not the language of truth but of fal&s;ehood. I &s;hould hope a little &s;erious con&s;ideration will convince of this.</P>
<P>Again, re&s;pecting the cu&s;tom or practice of &s;inging, I have a few ob&s;ervations to make. How incon&s;i&s;tent it is, that they who have ju&s;t before been confe&s;&s;ing their mi&s;ery and wretchedne&s;s, &s;hould appear &s;o quick|ly
<PB N="44" REF="036346_0043_10091CC1083038D0">
and ea&s;ily to forget all, and begin &s;inging. Surely it &s;eems evidently to declare, they were not &s;incere in their acknowledgements, or that they think it of very little con&s;equence whether their prayers are an&s;wered or not. Be&s;ides, not only the manner to me appears ab&s;urd and incon&s;i&s;tent, but the matter in many quite contrary to truth, and to what has been ju&s;t before openly avowed. I could &s;pecify many in&s;tances in every collection I have &s;een, but I wi&s;h people to &s;earch for them&s;elves. Surely this is trifling with &s;erious things. I am fully per&s;uaded that the common practice of &s;inging is only calculated to amu&s;e the creature, to plea&s;e the outward ear; whatever may be pretended of its warming the heart, and kindling devotion. And if tho&s;e who practi&s;e it would be hone&s;t and can|did, I am of opinion they would be con&s;trained to acknowledge that <HI>amu&s;ement</HI> is the chief object: or why &s;o plea&s;ed with tunes and mu&s;ic? Can it for a moment be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the Almighty is to be plea&s;ed with &s;uch &s;uperficial conduct? Surely not. And with re&s;pect to its kindling devotion, it may be well to remember what is &s;aid of tho&s;e, "who kindle a fire, and encompa&s;s them&s;elves about with &s;parks; they may walk in the light thereof, but they &s;hall lie down in &s;orrow," I&s;a. L. 11. I readily admit what is advanced to defend this cu&s;tom, that our Lord and his di&s;ciples, the night before he &s;uffered, &s;ang a hymn, but what or how we are not informed; no doubt the matter and manner were both proper and &s;ea&s;onable; and that Paul and Silas, in pri&s;on, "&s;ang prai&s;es to the Lord," I believe; but I cannot conceive what ar|gument can be deduced from thence for the pre&s;ent cu&s;tom of &s;inging whatever may be given out, &s;uita|ble or not, whether prai&s;e, profe&s;&s;ion, acknowledge|ment, or petition. I fully believe this outward incon&s;iderate &s;inging is very different from that recommended by the apo&s;tle, "Singing with the &s;pi|rit,
<PB N="45" REF="036346_0044_10091CC471E15920">
and with the under&s;tanding. 1 Cor. xiv. 15. "Singing and making melody in your hearts to the Lord," Eph. v. 19. And I al&s;o believe, that the true &s;ource of prai&s;e, even a grateful &s;en&s;e of the Lord's mercies can be more con&s;i&s;tently expre&s;&s;ed than in outward jingle and &s;ound.</P>
<P>Indeed, my friends, I fear you are, many of you, agreeably to your own confe&s;&s;ion, in a mi&s;erable con|dition. Suffer me to prevail upon you to con&s;ider, whether your continuing year after year mi&s;erable &s;inners, is not the con&s;equence of your prayers not being heard: and let a concern ari&s;e to enquire, whe|ther you have been &s;eeking aright or not: for our Lord promi&s;ed plainly and expre&s;sly, "that they who &s;eek &s;hall find," Matt. vii. 5. Now, what have they found, who continue as they acknowledge, 'mi&s;era|ble &s;inners having no health in them,' &amp;c? Do they not rather confe&s;s that the means they have u&s;ed are in&s;ufficient to clean&s;e and heal them; that they have not rightly applied to the great phy&s;ician, to the balm of Gilead, "to that tree, who&s;e leaves are for the healing of the nations; but have been &s;pending their money for that which is not bread, and their labour for that which &s;atisfieth not; in&s;tead of hearkening diligently unto the Lord, and eating that which is good;" I&s;a. lv. 2. that true bread of life, which our Lord &s;aid, "he that eateth of this Bread &s;hall live for|ever?" John vi. 58. It may be well to have recour&s;e to the&s;e means before the po&s;&s;ibility of cure is denied; le&s;t they thereby deny the power of God, that he is not able to "ca&s;t out the &s;trong man armed, who keepeth his palace and his goods in peace," Luke xi. 21. I think I need not add, who is there meant by the &s;trong man armed, where is his palace, and what are his goods. The apo&s;tle &s;peaks of &s;ome, "who had a form of godline&s;s but denied the power thereof." 2 Tim. iii. 5. Now, it may be well to con&s;ider, in what
<PB N="46" REF="036346_0045_10091CC6ECC476E8">
can the power of godline&s;s be known, hut in domini|on over its adver&s;ary, which is &s;in. And do not they who deny the po&s;&s;ibility of &s;in's being &s;ubdued, deny the power of godline&s;s? A &s;erious con&s;ideration may not be unprofitable. I have often admired, that tho&s;e who plead for &s;in, pretend highly to value the &s;crip|tures, and &s;ay, 'the &s;criptures is the rule;' whereas the &s;criptures uniformly in&s;i&s;t upon the nece&s;&s;ity of ho|line&s;s; not an imaginary holine&s;s, but a real purity of heart and of life. "Without holine&s;s," &s;aid the apo|&s;tle, "no man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord," Heb, xii. 14. "Be ye holy in all manner of conver&s;ation, becau&s;e it is written, be ye holy for I am holy." 1 Pet. i. 15. "Pre&s;ent your bodies, (mark, your bodies) a living &s;acrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your rea&s;onable &s;ervice." Rom. xii. 1. They talk much of the blood of Chri&s;t; it is a &s;ubject often in the mouth, but what of the nature and effects of it is known, let their own acknowledgements te&s;tify. The apo&s;tle de|clares it clean&s;eth from all &s;in." 1 John i. vii. Now how tho&s;e who continue 'mi&s;erable &s;inners, doing what they ought not to do,' &amp;c. can be clean&s;ed from all &s;in, let the con&s;iderate judge.</P>
<P>It is with me now, to an&s;wer &s;ome objections to this important truth; and to remark on &s;ome pa&s;&s;a|ges of &s;cripture, which tho&s;e who deny the po&s;&s;ibility of &s;in being &s;ubdued, endeavour to cover them&s;elves with. Fir&s;t, that 'The heart of man is deceitful above all things, and de&s;perately wicked, who can know it?' Jer. xvii. 9. That the heart of every man, of every natural unregenerate man, is truly &s;o, I firmly believe: but be it remembered that the Lord promi&s;ed to give his people a new heart and a new &s;pirit: Ezek. xxxvi. 26. And dare any one &s;ay, that heart is de|ceitful and wicked? O, beware of depreciating the gift of God. "Ble&s;&s;ed are the pure in heart, &s;aith our Lord, for they &s;hall &s;ee God." Matt. v. 8, "A
<PB N="47" REF="036346_0046_10091CC990145158">
good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit." Mark vii. 18. "The &s;eed on the good ground are they who in an hone&s;t and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience." Luke viii. 15. For now, in the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation, the axe is laid to the root of the tree, Matt. iii. 10. What is the root of the tree there alluded to but the heart, from whence words and actions have their birth? "Thou blind Phari&s;ee," &s;aid Chri&s;t, clean&s;e fir&s;t that which is with|in the cup and the platter, that the out&s;ide may be clean al&s;o "Matt. xxiii. 26. And do they not in the &s;tated form, pray that God 'would clean&s;e the thoughts of their hearts, by the in&s;piration of his holy &s;pirit;' a mo&s;t excellent petition; but what is it in tho&s;e who u&s;e it, and yet deny the po&s;&s;ibility of its being an&s;wered, but a &s;olemn mockery? For if the thoughts of the heart are really clean&s;ed, there can be no &s;in; for &s;in defiles and pollutes the heart.</P>
<P>Another objection, is the language of the apo&s;tle, where he &s;peaks of 'a law in his members warring again&s;t the law of his mind, and bringing him into captivity to the law of &s;in, and that in his fle&s;h dwelt no good thing," Rom. vii. That the apo&s;tle once was in that &s;tate, I think, is beyond a doubt; and that every real Chri&s;tian experiences a &s;imilar, till the &s;trong man armed is ca&s;t out, and the old leaven purged away. But that he was &s;o at the time of writ|ing it, to me appears by no means credible, from what he has written ju&s;t before and after; or he mu&s;t gro&s;sly contradict him&s;elf, which will hardly be allow|ed? but rather that he was de&s;cribing the effects of the law upon the carnal unregenerate mind: for he &s;ays, "The law is &s;piritual, but I am carnal, &s;old under &s;in." Now can it be &s;uppo&s;ed that the apo&s;tle was then carnal? &amp;c. Surely not, For ju&s;t after, he &s;ays, 'The carnal mind is enmity again&s;t God,' and 'to be car|nally
<PB N="48" REF="036346_0047_10091CCCF1346F80">
minded is death,' chap. viii. 6.7. and that "they who are in the fle&s;h cannot plea&s;e God;" but he adds, "Ye are not in the fle&s;h, but in the &s;pirit, if the &s;pirit of God dwell in you; and if any man have not the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t, he is none of his." It con&s;e|quently follows, that if the apo&s;tle was then in a carnal &s;tate, he was none of Chri&s;t's, but at enmity again&s;t God. A little before, he &s;ays, "Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of &s;in might be de&s;troyed, that henceforth we &s;hould not &s;erve &s;in: for he that is dead is freed from &s;in," chap. vi. 6.7. And in the 2nd ver&s;e "How &s;hall we that are dead to &s;in, live any longer there|in." And in the 22nd ver&s;e, "Being made free from &s;in, and become &s;ervants to God, ye have your fruit unto holine&s;s, and the end everla&s;ting life."</P>
<P>Now let this plain language, both before and after, written no doubt at the &s;ame time, determine whe|ther the apo&s;tle was then in a carnal unregenerate &s;tate or not. And though he el&s;ewhere &s;ays, "Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect;" Phil. iii. 10. I think it in no re&s;pect favours the con&s;truction many put upon it, that the apo&s;tle was then in a &s;inful &s;tate; but rather makes again&s;t them, as it plainly condemns the notion, of being perfectly and for ever ju&s;tified by mere imputation, and evinces the danger of &s;itting down at ea&s;e, re&s;ting &s;atisfied with an imaginary ju&s;tification. For in another place, &s;peaking of the Chri&s;tian progre&s;s, he &s;ays, though he did not run as uncertainly, or fight as one that beateth the air, yet he found it nece&s;&s;ary to keep under his body and bring it into &s;ubjection, or there was a danger, notwith&s;tanding he had preached to others, of his being &s;till a ca&s;t away, 1 Cor. ix. 26, 27. Another objection is, the &s;ame apo&s;tle &s;ays, "By grace ye are &s;aved, through faith, and that not of your&s;elves; it is the gift of God, not

of works, le&s;t any man &s;hould boa&s;t.' Eph. ii. 8.9. In an&s;wer to which, I believe it is very nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;tingui&s;h between the works of man, which he does in his own will and &s;trength, and tho&s;e works which are wrought of God. Perhaps it is not right|ly knowing this di&s;tinction that people cry out again&s;t works, as though they were all &s;elf-righteou&s;ne&s;s. The works of man, of the unrenewed carnal mind, yea the be&s;t of them, are as filthy rags; but I think there &s;hould be a great care not to join the works of God (tho&s;e which he worketh in his people) with man's own works; for in the next ver&s;e the apo&s;tle &s;ays, "Ye are his workman&s;hip, created in Chri&s;t Je&s;us unto good works, which God hath before ordained, that we &s;hould walk in them." That it is by grace, I believe, no real Chri&s;tian will deny, but will, with humble gratitude in all his progre&s;s, acknowledge with the apo&s;tle, "by the grace of God I am what I am," 1 Cor. xv, 10. This grace the &s;ame apo&s;tle declared, hath appeared to all men, (mark that, not to any particular part) and teaches, that denying ungodline&s;s and worldly lu&s;ts, we &s;hould live &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly, and godly, in this pre&s;ent world. He does not &s;ay (it teaches) we mu&s;t continue in &s;in, "What," &s;ays he in another place, "&s;hall we continue in &s;in, that grace may abound, God forbid," Rom. vi. 1. That it is al&s;o through faith, who will deny? for "without faith it is impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;ed God," Heb. xi. 6. But the apo&s;tle &s;peaks of a dead faith, James ii. 17. of a faith the devils have, ver&s;e 19. The true faith, he &s;ays, worketh by love, Gal. v. 6. purifieth the heart, Acts xv. 9. and overcometh the world, 1 John v. 4. Now what faith have tho&s;e, who &s;ay, they are 'tied and bound with the chain of their &s;ins, that they are mi&s;erable &s;inners having no health in them,' &amp;c. The tree is known by it fruit.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="036346_0049_10091CD04819AB60">Again, the words of our Lord, when upon the earth in the days of his fle&s;h, to tho&s;e whom he had healed of their di&s;ea&s;es, are pleaded in excu&s;e for continuing in &s;in, as "Thy faith hath &s;aved thee, thy faith hath made thee whole, &amp;c. But be it re|membered, that tho&s;e to whom he &s;aid &s;o were completely cured, received 'perfect &s;oundne&s;s;' and I believe, there is a remnant at this day, who witne&s;s the &s;ame works, &s;piritually accompli&s;hed by the pow|erful operation of the &s;ame word in the heart, even a being made whole, a being healed of the great di&s;ea&s;e of &s;in, prefigured by the various cures performed on the bodies of the people.</P>
<P>Once more, another argument adduced is where the apo&s;tle &s;ays, "If we &s;ay we have no &s;in we de|ceive our&s;elves and the truth is not in us," 1 John i. 8. But a due attention to what follows, I think will clearly explain, that the apo&s;tle does not favour the idea that he was then in that &s;tate; for he adds, "if we &s;ay we have not &s;inned," plainly alluding to time pa&s;t, and continues, "if we confe&s;s our &s;ins, he is faithful and ju&s;t to forgive us our &s;ins, and to clean&s;e us from all unrighteou&s;ne&s;s;" and as all un|righteou&s;ne&s;s is &s;in, chap. v. 17. they who are clean&s;ed from all, &s;urely can have none remaining. It is the &s;incere de&s;ire of my mind, that the people would con&s;ider for them&s;elves, and not take things of &s;uch importance upon tru&s;t, but attend to the ad|vice of the apo&s;tle, "Let every man prove his own work, then &s;hall he have rejoicing in him&s;elf, and not in another, for every man &s;hall bear his own burden." Gal. vi. 4, 5. "Be not deceived," he adds ju&s;t after, "God is not mocked; what&s;oever a man &s;oweth, that &s;hall he reap," whatever be his opi|nion, knowledge or faith. And in another place he &s;ays, though he had all knowledge, could under&s;tand all my&s;teries, though he had all faith, even to remove

mountains, yet he might be as nothing, 1 Cor, xiii. 2. Therefore it might be well to have a care of talk|ing &s;o highly of the &s;criptures, while the life and conver&s;ation is not agreeable thereto; and remember the words of our Lord to &s;ome of old, "Search the &s;criptures for in them ye think ye have eternal life; and they are they which te&s;tify of me, and ye will not come unto me that ye might have life," John v. 39, 40. From which it appears, and is worthy of the mo&s;t &s;erious attention, that tho&s;e who had the &s;crip|tures and valued them, as to think they had eternal life in them, yet they would not come unto Chri&s;t, of whom they te&s;tified; and "who was and is alone the life as well as the light of men," John i. 4. Therefore it may be well to take care of putting the letter, the te&s;timony, the declaration, concerning an object, for the object it&s;elf; for our Lord did not &s;ay the &s;criptures is the way; but "I am the way, the truth, and the life, and no man cometh unto the Father but by me," John xiv. 6. And learn the difference between the letter, the outward word, and the word that was in the beginning, John i. 1. before the &s;criptures, "the word nigh in the mouth, and in the heart;" Rom. x. 8, "which is quick and powerful, &s;harper than a two-edged &s;word, dividing a&s;under &s;oul and &s;pirit, joints and marrow, and is a di&s;cerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart, before whom all things are naked and open," Heb. iv. 12; and of whom, as I before ob&s;erved, the &s;criptures te&s;tify; and without who&s;e all-powerful aid they remain a dead letter, a &s;ealed book. The apo&s;tle declared, the things of God can only be known by the Spirit of God, 1 Cor. ii. 11. They are fooli&s;hne&s;s to the natural man. Therefore I think we &s;hould be careful how we attempt to comprehend the truths, which are contained in the &s;criptures by our own under&s;tandings; but rather be willing, as the
<PB N="52" REF="036346_0051_10091CD6264A46D0">
apo&s;tle recommends, to become fools, that we may be truly wi&s;e, 1 Cor. iii. 18.</P>
<P>I would now offer a few remarks on tho&s;e two or|dinances or ceremonies, Bapti&s;m and the Lord's Sup|per as they are called.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the fir&s;t, as practi&s;ed by tho&s;e I more particularly addre&s;s my&s;elf to, little need be &s;aid; as &s;prinkling infants is not even an imitation of true bapti&s;m, has no relation to it whatever, nor do I believe there can be found a &s;ingle precept or exam|ple for it in any of the &s;criptures of truth. I am well per&s;uaded it is, like many other things of the kind, a mere popi&s;h invention, in the times of darkne&s;s and apo&s;tacy, as a &s;ub&s;titute for the reality; not in any one re&s;pect calculated to an&s;wer any good purpo&s;e whatever. It may be well &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider a language u&s;ed at that ceremony, "that this child is regenerate, and grafted into the body of Chri&s;t's church;" and in the catechi&s;m re&s;pecting it, that "he is therein made a member of Chri&s;t, a child of God, and an inheritor of the kingdom of Heaven." Now let every con&s;iderate per&s;on &s;olemnly a&s;k him|&s;elf, whether he really believes &s;uch effects are really produced by it. If it is po&s;&s;ible that any one can think &s;o, his ideas of regeneration, and Chri&s;t's church al&s;o, differ very widely from mine.</P>
<P>Let it be con&s;idered al&s;o, what people are taught to promi&s;e at this ceremony: To renounce the devil and all his works, the pomps and vanities of this wicked world, and all the &s;inful lu&s;ts of the fle&s;h; to keep God's holy will and commandments, and to walk in the &s;ame all the days of their lives." Are they not here required to promi&s;e what is believed and confe&s;&s;ed to be impo&s;&s;ible to perform? for &s;urely if it was performed, they would not be "mi&s;era|ble &s;inners, doing what they ought not to do," &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="036346_0052_10091CD89B729898">That bapti&s;m is nece&s;&s;ary, ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, for every member of Chri&s;t's church, I fully believe; but I believe, no application of water, even when rightly imitated, is the one true bapti&s;m. It is not the putting away the filth of the fle&s;h, which is all outward elementary water can do, but "the bapti&s;m of the Holy Gho&s;t and of fire," Mat. iii. 11, even a being bapti&s;ed in the name, that is nature, of the Father, Son, and Holy Gho&s;t; thereby experiencing the con&s;uming of the earthly part in them&s;elves, and a being clean&s;ed and purified from all filthine&s;s of fle&s;h and &s;pirit, perfecting holine&s;s in the fear of the Lord; for the apo&s;tle &s;ays, "As many as are baptized into Chri&s;t, have put on Chri&s;t," Gal, iii. 27. not ima|ginarily, but really; and being buried with him, by this &s;piritual bapti&s;m into death, even a death unto &s;in: that "like as Chri&s;t was rai&s;ed from the dead by the glory of the Father, &s;o they al&s;o will walk in the newne&s;s of life," Rom. vi 4. And again, If any man be in Chri&s;t he is a new creature, old things are pa&s;&s;ed away, all things become new, and all of God." 2 Cor. v. 17. and if all of God, there can be no &s;in, for "&s;in is of the devil, and not of God." 1 John iii. 8.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to that other ceremony, called the Lord's Supper, notwith&s;tanding I am &s;en&s;ible of the deep rooted prejudice in favour of it, I feel no di&s;|couragement; under a belief that a glorious day is dawning, when clouds and &s;hadows, &s;igns and ap|pearances, &s;hall give place to reality, to the pure e&s;&s;ential &s;ub&s;tance. I am perfectly &s;atisfied in mine own mind re&s;pecting it, and will endeavour to give my rea&s;ons, why I believe it is not of that con&s;equence or obligation many fix upon it.</P>
<P>That our Lord, the night before he &s;uffered, took bread and brake it, and gave to his di&s;ciples, as al&s;o the cup, I believe; and that he &s;aid, this do in
<PB N="54" REF="036346_0053_10091CDA206507A0">
remembrance of me; but that he enjoined it to be an ordinance I cannot find. I pre&s;ume it will be allowed to be a part of the fea&s;t of the Jewi&s;h pa&s;&s;o|ver, as our Lord &s;aid, "With de&s;ire, I have de&s;ired to eat this pa&s;&s;over with you, before I &s;uffer," Luke xxii. 16. and which was a remarkable type or figure of Chri&s;t, who was the very Pa&s;chal Lamb, the &s;ub|&s;tance or antitype it&s;elf. That the bread and wine, as a part of the pa&s;&s;over, repre&s;ented the body and blood of Chri&s;t, to be broken and &s;hed for the remi&s;|&s;ion of &s;ins, I pre&s;ume will al&s;o be allowed. Now as there is certainly a very e&s;&s;ential difference between the &s;ign and the thing &s;ignified, let us con&s;ider a little, which is of mo&s;t con&s;equence, or whether both are of obligation. I expect none to whom I addre&s;s my&s;elf will deny, that Chri&s;t was and is really the &s;ub&s;tance and antitype of every type and figure, under the Mo&s;aic ceremonial di&s;pen&s;ation. This then being one of tho&s;e figures repre&s;enting the death of Chri&s;t; the &s;ub&s;tance being come, the type fulfilled, what need of the &s;hadow; why not give place, as others are acknowledged to do? The apo&s;tle, writing to &s;ome, remarks, "As often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do &s;hew the Lord's death, till he come." 1 Cor. xi. 26. But this I think, by no means im|plies that it was an enjoined ordinance, but rather, that tho&s;e to whom he was writing, continued in the u&s;e or ob&s;ervance of the jewi&s;h pa&s;&s;over. This I think, cannot appear improbable, when it is con&s;i|dered, that for a time it was taught by &s;ome of the di&s;ciples, that "it was needful to be circumci&s;ed, and to keep the law of Mo&s;es," Acts xv. 5. of cour&s;e this among the re&s;t. Therefore it appears to me, that they, as yet, knew not, in a &s;piritual &s;en&s;e, the co|ming of Chri&s;t; that is, his &s;piritual appearance in their hearts; an inference which &s;eems to be confirmed by what is recorded of &s;ome, who had been bapti&s;ed
<PB N="55" REF="036346_0054_10091CDCEF2B0ED8">
with John's bapti&s;m, that is of water, yet had not &s;o much as heard whether there were an Holy Gho&s;t, Acts xix. 2. the promi&s;ed mode of his coming again, John xvi. 7. Again, the apo&s;tle &s;ays, &s;peaking unto wi&s;e men, no doubt &s;piritually wi&s;e, "The cup of ble&s;&s;ing we ble&s;s, is it not the communion of the blood of Chri&s;t: The bread we break, is it not the communion of the body of Chri&s;t?" 1 Cor. x. 15.16. Can it be &s;uppo&s;ed that he here alludes to out|ward bread and wine? for if he did, all who partake of that ceremony, let them be who they may, or what they may, have communion with Chri&s;t. Sure|ly that would be joining light and darkne&s;s, Chri&s;t and Belial, righteou&s;ne&s;s and unrighteou&s;ne&s;s together, in direct oppo&s;ition to the &s;ame apo&s;tle's plain decla|ration to the &s;ame people. 2 Cor. vi. xv. He &s;ays again, "Ye cannot drink of the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils; ye cannot be partakers of the Lord's table and the table of devils," 1 Cor. x. 20. Now it is very obvious, that any can partake of the outward bread and wine, therefore that cannot be the cup and table of the Lord. Again, what is re|corded of the di&s;ciples breaking bread from hou&s;e to hou&s;e, Acts ii. 24, I think by no means implies &s;uch a ceremony, but rather a &s;ocial way of living among them&s;elves; as it is &s;aid, they had all things common, ver&s;e 44, and, from what immediately follows, "did eat their meat with gladne&s;s and &s;inglene&s;s of heart," ver&s;e 46, plainly alluding to their common meals. It is al&s;o I think, very ob&s;ervable, that when the apo&s;tles were a&s;&s;embled at Jeru&s;alem, to con&s;ider what was nece&s;&s;ary to be enjoined to the believing Gen|tiles, this ceremony was not even mentioned: which had it been nece&s;&s;ary, would &s;ure not have been o|mitted, con&s;idering the things which were then enjoined; mo&s;t of which have &s;ince been laid a&s;ide, Acts xv. 20. But our Lord's own words appear to
<PB N="56" REF="036346_0055_10091CDFCF2964B8">
me decidedly to di&s;countenance the outward &s;ign; as where he emphatically calls him&s;elf the "Bread of Life." "That his fle&s;h is meat indeed, and his blood drink indeed, and that who&s;oever ate and drank it had eternal life." John vi. 46, &amp;c. And to reprove their carnal ideas of outward eating and drinking, ver&s;e 52, and to direct their minds to the &s;piritual allu&s;ion, he adds, "What, and if you &s;hall &s;ee the Son of Man a&s;cend up where he was before," ver&s;e 62, how will ye eat him then? not in outward bread and wine, "it is the &s;pirit that quickeneth, the fle&s;h (or outward food) profiteth nothing."</P>
<P>I believe there are among tho&s;e whom I addre&s;s my&s;elf to, &s;uch as are &s;en&s;ible of the nece&s;&s;ity of this &s;piritual communion, and are truly de&s;irous to par|take thereof. Far be it from me to wound any of the&s;e. I do tenderly &s;alute them, and feel a degree of unity with the lea&s;t appearance of the true &s;eed of the kingdom: I would not hurt the lea&s;t plant of the Lord's own right hand planting. However &s;ome lit|tle differences may appear, yet let me &s;ay to the&s;e in a &s;pirit of love and unity, as this is acknowledged to be but a &s;ign or token, why is this continued, when others of equal authority and obligation are di&s;pen&s;|ed with? For in&s;tance, that of circumci&s;ion, which our Lord &s;ubmitted to, Luke ii. 21; and which for a time, even after his a&s;cen&s;ion, was enjoined by his di&s;ciples, as I before quoted; Why this laid a&s;ide? It may perhaps be an&s;wered, this &s;ign according to the apo&s;tle's definition of it, repre&s;ented the circumci&s;ion made without hands, in putting off the body of the &s;ins of the fle&s;h, Col. ii. 11. I fully believe it did, and as it is equally true, that bread and wine is al&s;o a &s;ign, there appears to me not a &s;hadow of a rea&s;on, why the one &s;hould be continued in preference to the other: the thing &s;ignified by both being of equal obligation.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="036346_0056_10091CE364BDEA10">Again, it is worthy of ob&s;ervation, that the beloved di&s;ciple John, in his relation, makes not the lea&s;t men|tion of this ceremony; but is very particular in giving an account of our Lord's wa&s;hing his di&s;ciples feet. Why is not this ceremony ob&s;erved, as it ap|pears to be more particularly enjoined than the other? For &s;ays Chri&s;t, "Ye call me Ma&s;ter, and Lord, and ye &s;ay well, for &s;o I am; if I then your Lord and Ma&s;ter have wa&s;hed your feet, ye ought al&s;o to wa&s;h one another's feet, for I have given you an example, that ye &s;hould do as I have done unto you," John xiii. 13. Now where can there be found &s;o &s;trong an injunction for the other, that of bread and wine? If it is an&s;wered, that was a &s;ign or figure to teach hu|mility and love to each other, which I readily admit it was, I think it is nece&s;&s;ary to prove the other to be &s;omewhat more than a &s;ign to &s;upport its continu|ance in preference, which I expect will hardly be attempted. That it was not practi&s;ed or ob&s;erved as an ordinance by the apo&s;tles, I think evidently ap|pears, from the whole tenor of their writings. Paul reproves &s;ome for being &s;ubject to ordinances. "Touch not, ta&s;te not, handle not," &s;ays he, "which all are to peri&s;h with the u&s;ing." Col. ii. 20, and doth not outward bread and wine peri&s;h with the u&s;ing? The apo&s;tle well knew the true living bread was not of a peri&s;hable nature. Again, he &s;ays, "Let no man judge you in meat and in drink, or in re&s;pect to the holy day, new moon, or the &s;abbath, which" he adds, "are a &s;hadow of things to come, but the bo|dy, (the &s;ub&s;tance) is of Chri&s;t," ver&s;e 16. In ano|ther place he &s;ays, "The kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace, and joy in the Holy Gho&s;t." Rom. xiv. 17. And to &s;ome others he &s;aid "I am afraid of you, le&s;t I have be&s;tow|ed on you labour in vain;" becau&s;e after they had known God, had ta&s;ted &s;omewhat of the &s;ub&s;tance,
<PB N="58" REF="036346_0057_10091CE535174F00">
they turned again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto they de&s;ired again to be in bondage. Gal. iv. 9. "Ye ob&s;erve days, and months, and times, and years," ver&s;e 10, &s;aid he, which he had declared to be but &s;hadows of good things; and I fear the &s;ame language is too applicable to many, who make a very high profe&s;&s;ion in this day.</P>
<P>From what I have ob&s;erved on this &s;ubject, I think to an unprejudiced mind, it mu&s;t appear that the true &s;upper of the Lord is an inward, &s;piritual com|munion. "Behold," &s;ays Chri&s;t, "I &s;tand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come in to him, and will &s;up with him, and he with me." Rev. iii. 20; and that the outward bread and wine, was nothing more than a part of the Jewi&s;h ceremonial di&s;pen&s;ation; neither commanded to, nor practi&s;ed generally by, the gen|tiles in the apo&s;tle's days. For, I would ju&s;t add, if it is a nece&s;&s;ary ordinance; if in other words, it is what by many it is a&s;&s;erted to be, the effects of it would be evident; for our Lord &s;aid, "Who&s;oever ate his fle&s;h and drank his blood, had eternal life." Now I pre&s;ume no one to whom I now addre&s;s my|&s;elf will impute &s;uch an effect to outward bread and wine; therefore it cannot be the Lord's &s;upper. We no where read of two &s;uppers. The difference be|tween the &s;ign and thing &s;ignified, the &s;hadow and the &s;ub&s;tance, I believe many are in a degree &s;en&s;ible of; and as the &s;ub&s;tance, the reality is to be partaken of, yea ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary; (for &s;aid our Lord, "Except ye eat the fle&s;h of the Son of Man and drink his blood, ye have no life in you;" John vi. 53.) and as I before ob&s;erved, we read of but <HI>one</HI> &s;up|per of the Lord; &s;urely it is of con&s;equence rightly to know which is indeed the true &s;upper.</P>
<P>I have no doubt but there are tho&s;e who in &s;inceri|ty and uprightne&s;s of heart continue in the u&s;e of the
<PB N="59" REF="036346_0058_10091CE7CC5808C0">
&s;ign; far be it from me to judge the&s;e. I have only a caution to give in love, that where the&s;e &s;igns are regarded, it may be as to the Lord, and not unto men. See Rom. xiv. 6. I fully believe religion doth not con&s;i&s;t in ob&s;erving, or not ob&s;erving, outward ceremonies. For as the apo&s;tle &s;ays, "In Chri&s;t Je&s;us, neither circumci&s;ion availeth any thing, nor uncircum|ci&s;ion; but a new creature;" Gal. vi. 15. It is not a name, a profe&s;&s;ion, or any outward ob&s;ervance; but I am not without a fear that many regard them as to men, and are in bondage unto them, and &s;o &s;ettled down at ea&s;e in them, that they will hardly hear the lea&s;t objection to them. Such perhaps mu&s;t be left for a time: however, I have given &s;ome of my rea|&s;ons for ab&s;enting my&s;elf from your communion, and why I believe the wor&s;hip there performed, is <HI>not the wor&s;hip which the Lord requireth;</HI> that it is not agree|able, but contrary to the Scriptures; that it is not 'the means of grace, and ordinance of God,' but the invention and imagination of man; that it is wrong in principle and in practice; in <HI>principle,</HI> be|cau&s;e you are taught you mu&s;t not expect deliverance from &s;in in this life, whereas the &s;criptures te&s;tify the contrary; in <HI>practice,</HI> becau&s;e you wor&s;hip in your own wills, and teach for doctrines the commandments of men, which our Lord te&s;tified again&s;t; Mark vii. 7; yea, in an unregenerate &s;tate, according to your own confe&s;&s;ion, for a &s;inner is not regenerate. There|fore, what I have heard among you, that your be&s;t &s;ervices are polluted, is &s;trictly true; for while you your&s;elves are in the polluted &s;tate, all your performan|ces are polluted al&s;o. "For who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one," Job xiv. 4; but it may be well to remember, it &s;tands an unchangeable truth, "That the &s;acrifices of the wicked are an abo|mination to the Lord," Prov. xxi. 27; and though we may amu&s;e our&s;elves with the vain idea that all is
<PB N="60" REF="036346_0059_10091CEC1785BA80">
well, I do a&s;&s;uredly believe, that to offer any accepta|ble &s;acrifice or &s;ervice, we mu&s;t know, experimentally know, a being wa&s;hed, &s;anctified, and ju&s;tified in the name of the Lord Je&s;us, and by the &s;pirit of our God. 1 Cor. vi. 11. Therefore remember a language of old to &s;ome who had no health in them, but were un|&s;ound from head to foot, as many confe&s;s they now are. "To what purpo&s;e is the multitude of your &s;acrifices?" I&s;a. 1, 11. "Bring no more vain oblations, incen&s;e is abomination to me, the new moons and &s;abbaths, the calling of a&s;&s;emblies I cannot away with, it is iniquity even the &s;olemn meeting. When you &s;pread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes, yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear." ver. 13, 14. And con&s;ider the exhortation to them, "Wa&s;h ye, make ye clean, put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes: cea&s;e to do evil, learn to do well," &amp;c. ver. 16. Then it is added, "Though your &s;ins be as &s;carlet, they &s;hall be as white as &s;now: though they be red like crim&s;on, they &s;hall be as wool. If ye be willing and obedient, ye &s;hall eat the good of the land; but if ye refu&s;e and rebel, ye &s;hall be devoured with the &s;word: for the mouth of the Lord hath &s;poken it." ver. 18. Oh, how awful is this denunciation now fulfilling around us! It is the fervent breathing of my &s;pirit, that this highly pro|fe&s;&s;ing, much favoured nation, who have been calling abundantly upon the Lord with their mouths, and honouring him with their lips, may avert the impend|ing &s;troke, by truly humbling them&s;elves before him; and as his judgments are in the earth, may indeed learn righteou&s;ne&s;s, I&s;a. xxvi. 9.</P>
<P>I know, friends, from a degree of experience, that there are many and various appearances, &s;igns, and &s;hadows, &s;et up among profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tians; &s;ome of which I have pointed out. I now wi&s;h to direct, according to the ability I am at pre&s;ent favoured with,
<PB N="61" REF="036346_0060_10091CED9B5C16E0">
to the reality or &s;ub&s;tance it&s;elf; and this ine&s;tima|ble trea&s;ure which I had long in vain &s;ought for with|out, among the various appearances, I at la&s;t found to be within. I can anticipate the &s;urpri&s;e, and perhaps the indignation, the word <HI>within</HI> may excite in &s;ome minds, who may be ready to exclaim, Can there be any good thing in man? Yes, friends, the &s;overeign good, the only good, is to be found there; and I de&s;ire your patient attention while I endeavour to remove that unju&s;t, delu&s;ive, yea too de&s;tructive idea, that nothing good is to be found in man. I believe it is the grand artifice, the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful in&s;i|nuation of the great adver&s;ary of mankind, to divert the attention from <HI>that</HI> which is alone able effectually to de&s;troy his kingdom or rule in the heart, and draw it to objects without, to &s;imilitudes and appearances. (My&s;tery Babylon.) This good then, though in man, is not of man, it is not natural to him; but a free, &s;pontaneous, unmerited gift. This good is, with reverence be it &s;poken, even God him&s;elf; a truth, I believe of the utmo&s;t importance to be experiment|ally known by every individual; and a truth abun|dantly te&s;tified to in the &s;acred writings; as the ground work, the &s;ub&s;tance, the foundation of real religion; a language al&s;o repeatedly expre&s;&s;ed by the profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity; though the truth, the reality of it, appears &s;o little known, as by many even to be denied. Do not you frequently read, "I will dwell in them, and walk in them; I will be their God, and they &s;hall be my people," 2 Cor. vi. 16. "If a man love me," &s;aid our Lord, "he will keep my words, and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him," John xiv. 23. "The Comforter, even the Spirit of Truth," proceeding from the Father, &s;aid he, "dwell|eth with you, and &s;hall be in you," ver. 17. "Know ye not," &s;aid the Apo&s;tle, "that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is in
<PB N="62" REF="036346_0061_10091CF02E4FF500">
you except ye be reprobates?" 2 Cor. xiii. 5, and that your bodies are the temples of the living God? 1 Cor. vi. 19. I could multiply quotations of Scrip|tures, to prove this great important truth, but am &s;en&s;ible that tho&s;e to whom I addre&s;s my&s;elf are well acquainted with the words. 'You are frequently reading, of "Chri&s;t within the hope of glory," Col, i. 27, under various &s;imilitudes; but what is the rea&s;on, he is not known there? It is an important que&s;tion. What is the rea&s;on, I again repeat it, that Chri&s;t &s;o often read of in the Scriptures as within, notwith&s;tanding &s;o much talk and imaginations about him, is not known there in reality? I believe, friends, I can tell you the rea&s;on why he, the one great foun|dation, is not known, where alone he is truly to be known. Becau&s;e he is not &s;ought for there; but in &s;omething without, &s;ome appearance or repre&s;entati|on of him, a knowledge gathered from men or books, from the hi&s;tory or outward letter, which, however highly it may be valued, I believe is merely notional. The real experimental knowledge is only known by his internal appearance, his &s;econd coming, without &s;in, unto &s;alvation; Heb. ix. 28. and the operation and effects thereby produced. See Mal. iii. 3, "The kingdom of God," &s;aid our Lord, "cometh not by ob&s;ervation:" man with all his wi&s;dom, is unable to comprehend it, neither &s;hall they &s;ay, "Lo here is Chri&s;t, or lo there," not in any outward appearance, "for behold the kingdom of God is within you." Luke xvii. 20, 21. "Say not in thine heart," &s;aid the apo&s;tle, "who &s;hall a&s;cend into heaven that is to bring Chri&s;t down from above, or who &s;hall de&s;cend into the deep, that is to bring Chri&s;t again from the dead:" He is not at a di&s;tance, but "the word is nigh thee, in thy mouth and in thy heart, Rom. x. 6, 7, 8. Our Lord repre&s;ented this great truth by various ob|jects or &s;imilitudes, to convey &s;piritual in&s;truction to his
<PB N="63" REF="036346_0062_10091CF1DE9F7658">
di&s;ciples; as a trea&s;ure hid in a field; Mat. xiii. 44, &s;eed &s;own in the ground; Mark iv. 26, a grain of mu&s;tard &s;eed; Mat. xiii. 31, a little leaven hid in meal; ver. 33. plainly alluding to this ine&s;timable trea&s;ure as hid in the heart, the earthly part of man. There were &s;ome of whom our Lord &s;aid, having ears they heard not; they could not under&s;tand the &s;piritual meaning of his parables; but to &s;ome he &s;aid, "Unto you it is given to know the my&s;teries of the kingdom of God." Mark iv. 11. Now, friends, it is of con&s;equence to know of which number we are, whether the&s;e are &s;till to us as parables, or whether we know <HI>that</HI> which unfolds their true meaning: "I am the light of the world;" &s;aid Chri&s;t, "he that followeth me, &s;hall not walk in darkne&s;s, but &s;hall have the light of life." John viii. 12.</P>
<P>The apo&s;tle &s;ays there is no communion between light and darkne&s;s. 2 Cor. vi. 14. If we have not light, we mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be in darkne&s;s. There is a &s;piritual light, as well as a natural. This great apo&s;tle to the gentiles, declaring his commi&s;&s;ion to preach the go&s;pel, &s;aid it was to turn people from darkne&s;s to light, from the power of &s;atan unto God. Acts xxvi. 18. Of what con&s;equence then is it to be acquainted with this light, by which alone we can di&s;cern between good and evil. "All things," &s;aid the apo&s;tle" that are reproved, are made manife&s;t by the light; for what&s;oever doth make manife&s;t is light." Eph. v. 13. That we may know what this light is the &s;criptures abundantly declare, John the Bapti&s;t was &s;ent to bear witne&s;s of this light, which is the true light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world. John 1.8, 9. In him, i. e. Chri&s;t, was life, and the life was the light of men. ver. 4. This light &s;hineth in darkne&s;s, even the dark heart of man; though the darkne&s;s compre|hended it not. ver. 5. This is the light of the glori|ous go&s;pel; therefore, friends, I caution you to
<PB N="64" REF="036346_0063_10091CF57157A338">
beware of calling it a natural light, or a new light as many have done. For I believe the &s;ame light, if attended to and its di&s;coveries obeyed, will effect the &s;ame works &s;piritually in the heart, or inner man, as it formerly did on the bodies of the people. There|fore I believe there is great danger of &s;peaking evil of the light, for whoever do, confe&s;s they are &s;trangers to it, and of cour&s;e are walking in darkne&s;s, for there is but one true &s;piritual light. And "If we &s;ay we have fellow&s;hip with him and walk in darkne&s;s, <HI>we</HI> lie, and do not the truth: but if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellow&s;hip one with another, and the blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t his Son, clean&s;eth us from all &s;in." 1 John i. 6, 7.</P>
<P>Our Lord him&s;elf plainly declared&punc; that "Every one that doeth evil, hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, le&s;t his deeds &s;hould be reproved; but he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manife&s;t, that they are wrought in God." John. iii. 20, 21. Therefore it is not &s;trange that tho&s;e who plead for &s;in, which is evil, &s;hould &s;peak again&s;t this light, and call it a natural light; or any thing, to excu&s;e them&s;elves; becau&s;e it cannot but condemn them. Tho&s;e things which the light, if attended to, would manife&s;t to be evil, are too dearly loved to be parted with, while they can per&s;uade them&s;elves they are &s;ecure in retaining them. I &s;peak from experience, and do earne&s;tly recommend a turning to this light within, from all the <HI>'Lo heres,'</HI> and <HI>'Lo theres;'</HI> the various appearances, &s;igns, and &s;hadows, &s;et up by the will and wi&s;dom of men, in the times of darkne&s;s and apo&s;tacy; even to <HI>Chri&s;t within,</HI> the hope of glory, the true foundation, 1 Cor. iii. 11; the rock again&s;t which as it is faith|fully abode in, even the gates of hell &s;hall not prevail, Mat. xvi. 18; nor all the oppo&s;ition of men. This I believe is the &s;ub&s;tance of every &s;hadow, the reality
<PB N="65" REF="036346_0064_10091CF7E0EA4500">
of every appearance, the word nigh in the mouth and in the heart; the true anointing, which is truth and no lie, and which teacheth all things without need of man's teaching. 1 John ii. 27. This is the new covenant, graciou&s;ly promi&s;ed by the Mo&s;t High. "I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts, and will be their God, and they &s;hall be my people; and they &s;hall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, &s;aying, Know the Lord, for they &s;hall all know me, from the lea&s;t of them unto the greate&s;t of them, &s;aith the Lord." Jer. xxxi. 33.34.</P>
<P>Behold &s;aid our Lord, the kingdom of God is within you. Luke xvii. 21. The &s;eed of the king|dom which is &s;own in the heart, though too &s;mall for the eye of man's wi&s;dom to di&s;cover, though it is &s;till to the high profe&s;&s;ing Jew a &s;tumbling block, and to the worldly wi&s;e Greek fooli&s;hne&s;s; yet it is to tho&s;e who hear its call and obey it, Chri&s;t the power of God, and the wi&s;dom of God. 1 Cor. i. 23, 24. This I believe is the new birth, without which our Lord declared no one even could &s;ee the kingdom of God. John iii. 3. The birth which is not of blood, nor of the will of the fle&s;h, nor of the will of man, but of God, John i. 13. For that which is born of the fle&s;h, however high and &s;pecious its appearance, is &s;till fle&s;h; and that which is born of the &s;pirit, how|ever mean and contemptible in the eye of man's wi&s;|dom, is &s;pirit. The go&s;pel is a &s;piritual di&s;pen&s;ation. The &s;pirit of truth inwardly manife&s;ted, our Lord promi&s;ed &s;hould guide into all truth. John xvi. 13. The apo&s;tles were not to leave Jeru&s;alem till they had received it, Acts i. 4, and then we are informed, "They &s;pake as the &s;pirit gave them utterance." Acts ii. 4. We have no rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e they u&s;ed any form of words, neither that they &s;pake when or where they cho&s;e; but we are frequently informed of their going or forbearing, as by the &s;pirit they were direct|ed;
<PB N="66" REF="036346_0065_10091CF962CFA6D0">
Acts viii. 29. xix. 7, &amp;c. neither are we to &s;uppo&s;e that this influence and direction of the &s;pirit was con&s;ined to any period of time; for, &s;ays our Lord, "Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world." Mat. xxviii. 20. What a departure from their example and precepts is lament|ably con&s;picuous among mo&s;t profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tians; who have invented various images, forms, and modes of wor&s;hip, which they can perform when they plea&s;e; evidently acknowledging that they think the influence and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the &s;pirit unnece&s;&s;ary; at lea&s;t that they will begin at a venture, whether it may come or not! Surely it may be well to con&s;ider, whether it is not offering &s;trange &s;ire before the Lord. Lev. x. 1. The only <HI>true wor&s;hip</HI> under the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation, is, agreeably to our Lord's expre&s;s de|claration, <HI>that which is in &s;pirit and in truth,</HI> John iv. 24, and as the influences and movings of the &s;pirit, (although &s;o ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, as that no acceptable wor&s;hip can be performed without them) are not at our command; how proper, yea, how needful then, is an humble, &s;ilent, dependent waiting upon Him, who alone can admini&s;ter this a&s;&s;i&s;tance; that thereby the true preparation of the heart may be ex|perienced, to receive whatever He, who &s;earcheth the heart, and who alone knoweth what is good for tho&s;e who wait upon him, may be plea&s;ed to admini&s;ter: whether immediately, by his &s;till &s;mall voice in the &s;ecret of the heart; or in&s;trumentally, by whom&s;oe|ver he may plea&s;e to appoint!</P>
<P>"They that wait upon the Lord," &s;aid the Prophet, "&s;hall renew their &s;trength." I&s;a. xl. 31. It is the profe&s;&s;ed object of mo&s;t a&s;&s;emblies for religious wor|&s;hip, <HI>to wait upon the Lord.</HI> Now, whether tho&s;e who in &s;olemn humble &s;ilence, wait to feel the influences of the &s;pirit, to in&s;truct and enable, when and what to offer, or what immediately to receive from the fountain of good, are &s;uch as that promi&s;e applies to;
<PB N="67" REF="036346_0066_10091CFC339903D0">
or tho&s;e who are always ready to begin, either in a pre&s;cribed form, or in the exerci&s;e of their own natu|ral or acquired abilities, whether they may have the a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;o nece&s;&s;ary or not; I think a little &s;erious con&s;ideration may determine. Indeed the plain ex|pre&s;s meaning of the term, <HI>Waiting,</HI> appears to me to be a &s;ilent, attentive expectation of &s;omething; and if it is weightily con&s;idered, that, at &s;uch times, we more particularly profe&s;s to approach the &s;acred pre&s;ence of Him "who &s;earcheth the heart, trieth the reins, and requireth truth in the inward parts;" who cannot po&s;&s;ibly be deceived or amu&s;ed by the mo&s;t plau&s;ible expre&s;&s;ions or the mo&s;t eloquent language; who has decidedly condemned the practice of drawing near to him with the mouth, and honouring him with the lips, whil&s;t the heart is far from him; I&s;a. xxix. 13, &s;urely it is needful at &s;uch times to wait, &s;ilently wait, for the reception of &s;piritual power, le&s;t we &s;hould be like tho&s;e who offer the &s;acrifice of fools. Eccle&s;. v. 1. "Let not thine heart," &s;aid the wi&s;e man, "be ha&s;ty to utter any thing before God, for God is in heaven and thou up|on earth; therefore let thy words be few. ver. 2. "Without me," &s;aid our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, "ye can do nothing." John xv. 5. Yet the practice of many who profe&s;s to follow him, evidently declares that they think they can do without him, for they are, as to words and outward performances, always ready. The apo&s;tle plainly declared, that "we know not what we &s;hould pray for as we ought, but it is the &s;pi|rit that helpeth our infirmities." Rom. viii. 26. Then what are all the arts of compo&s;ition, and the powers of human eloquence, without this a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but as "&s;ounding bra&s;s or a tinkling cymbal?" "When ye pray," &s;aid our Lord, "u&s;e not vain re|pititions as the heathen do; for they think they &s;hall be heard, for their much &s;peaking:" Mat. vi. 7, a Language too applicable, I fear, not only to the pre|&s;cribed

formal prayers, but to the more private extempore productions, as though prayer con&s;i&s;ted in outward expre&s;&s;ion; an idea repeatedly condemned in the Scriptures of Truth.</P>
<P>The apo&s;tle, after &s;aying we know not what to pray for, adds, "The &s;pirit it&s;elf maketh interce&s;&s;ion for us, with groanings which cannot be uttered," and Chri&s;t called them hypocrites who prayed to be &s;een of men; Matt. vi. 5, and directed his di&s;ciples to pray in &s;ecret to the father; who &s;eeth in &s;ecret. ver. 6. The apo&s;tle al&s;o recommends a praying always, with all prayer and &s;upplication in the &s;pirit, and watching thereunto with all per&s;everance. Eph. vi 18. He does not recommend to begin &s;inging as &s;oon as they conclude a prayer. In another place, he exhorts to a "Continuing in&s;tant in prayer;" Rom. xii. 12. again, "Pray without cea&s;ing;" 1 Thes. v. 17 from all which I think it mu&s;t appear that <HI>there may be true prayer without words, and that there may al&s;o be words without prayer.</HI> I believe there are tho&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of con&s;i|derable abilities, a ready flow of words, and a plea&s;ing eloquent delivery, who can at any time when they plea&s;e, deliver what I have heard called an excellent prayer; without waiting to feel that influence, which can alone enable to "pray with the &s;pirit, and with true under&s;tanding;" but though &s;uch exerci&s;es may produce a temporary warmth, both in &s;peaker and hearer, I believe, it will be found to be only a fire of their own kindling, a mere appearance, and not the effects of the live coal from the true altar. I&s;a. vi. 6. The &s;ame ob&s;ervations are equally applicable to every other external performance of wor&s;hip, public or private: for however it may affect the outward ear, yea, and kindle &s;parks, as it were producing a temporary warmth; if it does not proceed from the immediate &s;en&s;ible movings of the &s;pirit of truth, I much fear the appellation of will-wor&s;hip is too applicable to it.</P>

That word which is quick and powerful, di&s;cerning the thoughts and intents of the heart." Heb. iv. 12.

<P>To conclude: the few ob&s;ervations I have now of|fered, may perhaps, to unprejudiced minds, be &s;uffi|cient to evince the inward &s;piritual nature of the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation; and that <HI>&s;igns and figures, all exter|nal ceremonial performances, are totally aboli&s;hed from that wor&s;hip, which can only be performed in &s;pirit and in truth;</HI> John iv. 23, 24.</P>
<P>They may al&s;o evince that the only nece&s;&s;ary quali|fication for true wor&s;hip, is the influence and direction of the &s;pirit of truth inwardly revealed: that this ne|ce&s;&s;ary a&s;&s;i&s;tance is not confined to time or place, nor to any particular man or &s;et of men. For as the apo&s;tle declared, "The manife&s;tation of the &s;pirit is given to every man, to profit withal," 1 Cor. xii. 7. I be|lieve there are no individuals arrived to the years of di&s;cretion, but who are favoured with a &s;ufficient por|tion thereof, if properly attended to, to direct them into the paths of true judgment. The word even the word of eternal life, is nigh to all, nor need any look to men for in&s;truction; but this &s;ame anointing, if the mind is &s;imply and unre&s;ervedly directed to it, teacheth all things and is truth. 1 John ii. 27. Who is there, who has not felt its &s;ecret reproofs for evil, and its approbation for good? To this true teacher, of who&s;e all &s;ufficient aid I have thankfully to acknowledge a degree of experience, I do earne&s;tly recommend the particular, unwearied, faithful, attention of every individual.</P>
