<P>IN the 27 <HI>v.</HI> of this Chapter, Our Lord Je&s;us Exhorts his Hearers, that they <HI>la|bour for the Meat which endureth to ever|la&s;ting life.</HI> And there is a double Mo|tive couched in the Exhortation.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) That this Spiritual heavenly food of the Soul is un&s;peakably de&s;irable; in that whereas bodily food, and all that the carnal heart can de&s;ire, is peri&s;hing, this is Everla&s;ting; and &s;uch as feed on it, &s;hall live for ever: Com|pare this 27 <HI>v.</HI> with <HI>v.</HI> 57. <HI>Labour not for the
<PB N="2" REF="039688_0003_10157FEA399472B0">
Meat which peri&s;heth, but for that Meat which en|dureth unto everla&s;ting life, which the Son of Man &s;hall give unto you; for him hath God the Father &s;ealed. As the living Father hath &s;ent me, and I live by the Father; &s;o he that eateth me, even he &s;hall live by me.</HI></P>
<P N="2">(2.) That it is Undoubtedly attainable. <HI>Which the &s;on of man &s;hall give unto you; for him hath God the Father &s;ealed.</HI> There is not only all fulne&s;s of &s;uitable and &s;atisfying Provi&s;ion &s;tored up in Chri&s;t; but he has both Authority and a Di&s;po&s;ition to give it out unto hungry and humble Beggars at his Door.</P>
<P>Now Chri&s;t having told them that they mu&s;t labour for this Unperi&s;hing Meat, they enquire what Works they mu&s;t do, <HI>v.</HI> 28. As the Young Man, Matth. 19.16. &mdash; <HI>Good Ma&s;ter, What good thing &s;hall I do that I may have Eternal Life.</HI> They are careful about many good works; but Chri&s;t directs them to One, which includes all, <HI>v.</HI> 29. <HI>Je&s;us an&s;wered and &s;aid unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath &s;ent.</HI> This is the <HI>One thing needful</HI>; for it receives Chri&s;t in all his Offices, with all his Benefits, that he may <HI>Of God be made unto us Wi&s;dom, Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, Sanctification and Redemption:</HI> So that even <HI>the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Law is fulfilled in them which are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us</HI> by a lively, working Faith; Rom. 8.1, 4. And <HI>the Faith of Gods Elect does work by love, purifie the heart, crucifie the fle&s;h, overcome the world, quench the fiery darts of the wic|ked one, give glory to God,</HI> and is the great Condi|tion of the New Covenant.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="039688_0004_10157FEE0827AD50">But what is this Faith, &s;o u&s;eful and efficaci|ous?</P>
<P>Why, it is nothing but what is expre&s;&s;ed by the Souls coming to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in the words of our Text, and tho&s;e that are next before it: <HI>And Je&s;us &s;aid unto them, I am the Bread of life: he that cometh to me &s;hall never hunger; and he that believeth in me &s;hall never thirst. But I &s;aid unto you, that ye al&s;o have &s;een me and believed not. All that the Father giveth me, &s;hall come to me; and him that cometh to me, I will in no wi&s;e ca&s;t out.</HI> By the Contexture of which three ver|&s;es, and the three that follow next after, you may plainly perceive that Coming to Chri&s;t, and Be|lieving on him, are the &s;ame thing: and as was &s;aid before, the <HI>One thing</HI> &mdash; for there be but two things that we fear, Death and Want: now he that comes to Chri&s;t &s;hall never die; and he that believes in him &s;hall never Want; Chap. 11.26. Compar'd with this Context.</P>
<P>And in the Text it &s;elf, there is Double in|couragement offered unto the Peri&s;hing Sinner, exactly An&s;wering the two-fold impediment ly|ing in the way of many Souls, when they are in|vited to come unto Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>I am &s;o weak and helple&s;s, &s;aith the Poor Soul, that I cannot move one half &s;tep towards Chri&s;t, in the way of Believing.</P>
<P>Now to An&s;wer this Objection,</P>
<P><HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> who <HI>died for us when,</HI> or becau&s;e <HI>we were without &s;trength,</HI> Rom. 5.6. does here put the di&s;couraged Heart in mind of the all-con|quering efficacy that there is in the Spirits Draw|ing;
<PB N="4" REF="039688_0005_10157FF05600F328">
who for this end is &s;ent out by the Father and the Son; even to make Chri&s;ts intended Spou&s;e <HI>willing</HI> to come, <HI>in the day of his Power&punc;</HI> All that the Father giveth me &s;hall come to me. His <HI>other Sheep,</HI> that are not yet effectually cal|led; they &s;hall hear the voice of their Shepherd, for he will find them Ears, <HI>Joh.</HI> 5.25.10.16, they &s;hall come unto, and follow him; yea run after him: for he will draw them by victorious Grace, <HI>Cant.</HI> 1.4. The Father, or the Elder Bro|ther gives the little Child a hand, when it nei|ther can nor dares attempt to take one &s;tep; and &s;o it comes &s;ecurely, though with much fear and trembling, to their arms and bo&s;om. <HI>All that the Father giveth me, &s;hall come to me.</HI></P>
<P>But the awakned Sinner hath further to &s;ay;</P>
<P>If I &s;hould come to Chri&s;t, laden as I am with iniquity; guilty before God and Man of tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion and &s;in; for number unaccountable; for heinou&s;ne&s;s double died: be&s;ides the cur&s;ed ig|norance and enmity &s;till remaining in my heart; that as I never have, &s;o I never can do any thing but di&s;honour God, and damn my own Soul: How can it ever enter into my heart, that &s;uch a Rebel &s;hall be received to Mercy; and &s;uch crim&s;on and &s;carlet abominations be forgiven.</P>
<P>An&s;w. <HI>Him that comes to me, I will in no wi&s;e cast out.</HI> What&s;oever he has been or done, and left undone or &s;et his heart upon; <HI>him that comes to me,</HI> let him be as bad as bad can be; and wor&s;e than he can think him&s;elf to be: Yea wor&s;e than ever came before him, or that ever refu&s;ed to come; yet, <HI>him that comes to me, I will in no wi&s;e cast out.</HI></P>

<P N="2">2. <HI>This Number was given to Christ, as the Crown and Recompence of his hard and co&s;tly Undertaking.</HI> Un&s;earchable Riches, and eternal Revenues of Glory would, by the Son of God, in the accompli&s;hment of &s;o great a De&s;ign, be brought into the King, his Father's Ex|chequer; it was therefore requi&s;ite, in point of Honour and Ju&s;tice, that &s;ome proportio|nable reward &s;hould be given unto this great and faithful Agent and Sufferer, in &s;o glori|ous a Cau&s;e.

to come to Chri&s;t, without Divine, almighty drawings: <HI>No man can come to me, except the Father which &s;ent me draw him</HI>&mdash;Joh. 6.44. But the &s;ight of their weakne&s;s is not enough to humble them: they are ready to make an Excu&s;e of that; they mu&s;t therefore by a more thorough work of Conviction, be made &s;en&s;ible that they want a Will as well as Power to come to Chri&s;t; that they have a heart full of re|bellion again&s;t the Authority of God, in every Command of the Law; but more e&s;pecially in [that Command of his] that Go&s;pel Command to peri&s;hing-Sinners, 1 Joh. 3.23. <HI>And this is his Commandment, that we &s;hould believe on the Name of his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> They mu&s;t have their Eyes op'ned to &s;ee al&s;o, the horrid nature of this Sin; what bla&s;|phemy there is in the Di&s;obedience of Un|belief, 1 Joh. 5.10, 11. <HI>He that believeth not God, hath made him a liar, becau&s;e he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son.

<P N="2">(2.) He is Self-obliged, by his own free Promi&s;es, to receive all Comers, good and bad, in the &s;en&s;e of that Text, Matth. 22.10. <HI>So tho&s;e Servants went out into the high-ways, and gathered together all, as many as they found, both

<P N="3">(3.) Yea, and his thus &s;ending forth his Servants, with &s;uch Me&s;&s;ages as they bring to hunger-&s;tarv'd, naked Beggars, does lay &s;ome ingagement on the Bountiful Ma&s;ter of the Fea&s;t, to make them welcome, when they come at his Call, and do as they are bidden, Matth. 22.4. <HI>Again he &s;ent forth other Servants, &s;aying, Tell them which are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my Oxen, and my Fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: Come unto the Marriage.</HI></P>
<P>Now, before we pa&s;s to another Argument, let us lay the&s;e Three things together: and can it once enter into our Thoughts, that the Dear and only Son of Gods Love will cro&s;s his Father's Will; that Eternal Truth will break his Promi&s;e, and Infinite Goodne&s;s invite fa|mi&s;hing Souls to a Fea&s;t, only to mock them?</P>

and the profit will be all their own: they were likely to be an Exerci&s;e to his Patience, all their Days in this World; by &s;lighting his offered Grace, before their Conver&s;ion, and abu&s;ing it afterwards.

<P>WE do this day, in the Strength of CHRIST; humbly and heartily avouch the Lord, who&s;e Name alone is JEHOVAH; Father, Son, and Spirit; to be Our GOD, and the GOD of our Seed; Entirely, and Ever|la&s;tingly Devoting, and Dedicating both our Selves, and Ours, unto His holy Fear, and Service, according to His Word; Promi&s;ing and Covenanting to Walk with GOD, and One another, as GOD's Cho&s;en People and a particular Church of CHRIST, ought to do: Complying with the whole Will of GOD, &s;o far as He has been plea&s;ed, or &s;hall further plea&s;e to di&s;cover His Mind to us by His Spirit, Word, and Providence; Acknow|ledging, Embracing, and Submitting un|to the Lord JESUS CHRIST God-Man, as Head of the Church, Prophet, Prie&s;t, and King of out Souls; the Only Mediator between GOD, and Man, and

Surety of the New Covenant; that He may of GOD be made unto us Wi&s;dom, Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Sanctification, and Re|demption; Looking for Acceptance of our Per&s;ons, and Services only in the Beloved. We do al&s;o expre&s;sly take GOD the HOLY GHOST to be our Sancti|fier, Teacher, Guide, and Comforter, by who&s;e gracious Influences we do more particularly Covenant, and Promi&s;e to attend Family, and Clo&s;et, as well as Publick Duties, and Means of Grace: That we will al&s;o maintain Subjection unto CHRIST in the Officers which GOD has &s;et in the Church, attending the Seals, and Cen&s;ures, according to the Orders, and Di&s;cipline of His Hou&s;e: That we will Watch over our Fellow-Members, and be Watched over by them, according to Scripture Rule: That we will Endeavour to bring up our Chil|dren, in the Nurture, and Admonition of the LORD. And in all things labour to Carry it towards tho&s;e that are without, as well as towards tho&s;e that are within, as becometh the Go&s;pel of CHRIST; that &s;o GOD may dwell among us, and be for us; and that we may be peculiar People to His Service, and Glory.</P>

NOW that we may Keep Covenant with our GOD, we de&s;ire from the bottom of our Hearts, to deny all Self-Wi&s;dom, Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and Strength; and to depend Wholly, and Only on the Divine All-&s;ufficiency. And wherein, after our be&s;t Endeavours, we &s;hall fail, and fall &s;hort: We would Penitently, Believingly, and with &s;incere renewed Purpo&s;es, be Waiting on Soveraign Grace, (through the Blood of the Covenant, and Interce&s;&s;ion of our Advocate with the Father, JESUS CHRIST the Righteous) for Repeated Pardons to be Sealed unto us by the Holy Spirit of Promi&s;e. To which FATHER, SON, and HOLY GHOST, One GOD, the &s;ame in Sub&s;tance, Equal in all Divine Perfections, Be Dominion and Fear, with Eternal Glory.
