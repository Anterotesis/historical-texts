<P>I RISE with peculiar diffidence to addre&s;s you upon this occa&s;ion, when I reflect upon the entertain|ment you propo&s;ed to your&s;elves from the eloquence of that learned member, Mr. CHARLES THOMPSON, whom your &s;uffrages appointed to this honor after the delivery of the la&s;t anniver&s;ary oration. Unhappily for the intere&s;ts of literature, his want of health has not permitted him to comply with your appointment. I beg therefore that you would forget for a while, the abilities nece&s;&s;ary to execute this ta&s;k with propriety, and li&s;ten with candor to the efforts of a member, who&s;e attachment to the &s;ociety, was the only qualifi|cation that entitled him to the honor of your choice.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="022123_0007_0FB6E8437A348EF8">
THE &s;ubject I have cho&s;en for this evening's enter|tainment, is <Q>An inquiry into the natural hi&s;tory of medicine among the Indians in North-America, and a comparative view of their di&s;ea&s;es and remedies, with tho&s;e of civilized nations.</Q> You will readily anticipate the difficulty of doing ju&s;tice to this &s;ubject. How &s;hall we di&s;tingui&s;h between the original di&s;ea&s;es of the Indians and tho&s;e contracted from their inter|cour&s;e with the Europeans? By what arts &s;hall we per&s;uade them to di&s;cover their remedies? And la&s;tly, how &s;hall we come at the knowledge of facts in that cloud of errors in which the credulity of the Europe|ans, and the &s;uper&s;tition of the Indians, have involved both their di&s;ea&s;es and remedies? The&s;e difficulties &s;erve to increa&s;e the importance of our &s;ubject. If I &s;hould not be able to &s;olve them, perhaps I may lead the way to more &s;ucce&s;sful endeavors for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I SHALL fir&s;t limit the tribes of Indians who are to be the objects of this inquiry, to tho&s;e who inhabit that part of North-America which extends from the 30th to the 60th degree of latitude. When we exclude the E&s;quimaux, who inhabit the &s;hores of Hud&s;on's bay, we &s;hall find a general re&s;emblance in the color, man|ners, and &s;tate of &s;ociety, among all the tribes of In|dians who inhabit that exten&s;ive tract of country.</P>
<P>CIVILIANS have divided nations into &s;avage, bar|barous, and civilized. The &s;avage, live by fi&s;hing and hunting. The barbarous, by pa&s;turage or cattle; and the civilized by agriculture. Each of the&s;e is connect|ed together in &s;uch a manner that the whole appear to form different parts of a circle. Even the manners of the mo&s;t civilized nations partake of tho&s;e of the &s;avage. It would &s;eem as if liberty and indolence were the

highe&s;t pur&s;uits of man; and the&s;e are enjoyed in their greate&s;t perfection by &s;avages, or in the practice of cu&s;toms which re&s;emble tho&s;e of &s;avages.</P>
<P>THE Indians of North-America partake chiefly of the manners of &s;avages. In the earlie&s;t accounts we have of them, we find them cultivating a &s;pot of ground. The maize is an original grain among them. The different di&s;hes of it which are in u&s;e among the white people &s;till retain Indian names.</P>
<P>IT will be unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;how that the Indians live in a &s;tate of &s;ociety adapted to all the exigencies of their mode of life. Tho&s;e who look for the &s;implicity and perfection of the &s;tate of nature, mu&s;t &s;eek it in &s;y&s;tems, as ab&s;urd in philo&s;ophy, as they are delightful in poetry.</P>
<P>BEFORE we attempt to a&s;certain the number or hi&s;tory of the di&s;ea&s;es of the Indians, it will be nece&s;|&s;ary to inquire into tho&s;e cu&s;toms among them which we know influence di&s;ea&s;es. For this purpo&s;e I &s;hall,

I. Of the birth and treatment of their children.</P>
<P>MUCH of the future health of the body depends up|on its original &s;tamina. A child born of healthy pa|rents always brings into the world a &s;y&s;tem formed by nature to re&s;i&s;t the cau&s;es of di&s;ea&s;es. The treatment of children among the Indians, tends to &s;ecure this hereditary firmne&s;s of con&s;titution. Their fir&s;t food is their mother's milk. To harden them again&s;t the ac|tion of heat and cold (the natural enemies of health and life among the Indians) they are plunged every day in cold water. In order to facilitate their being moved from place to place, and at the &s;ame time, to pre&s;erve their &s;hape, they are tied to a board, where they lie on their backs for &s;ix, ten, or eighteen months. A child generally &s;ucks its mother till it is two years old, and &s;ometimes longer. It is ea&s;y to conceive how much vigor their bodies mu&s;t acquire from this &s;imple, but whole&s;ome nouri&s;hment. The appetite we &s;ometimes ob&s;erve in children for fle&s;h, is altogether artificial. The peculiar irritability of the &s;y&s;tem in infancy, for|bids &s;timulating aliment of all kinds. Nature never calls for animal food till &s;he has provided the child with tho&s;e teeth which are nece&s;&s;ary to divide it. I &s;hall not undertake to determine how far the whole&s;ome qua|lity of the mother's milk is increa&s;ed by her refu&s;ing the embraces of her hu&s;band, during the time of giv|ing &s;uck.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="022123_0010_0FB6E85014C3C3F0">
II. THE diet of the Indians is of a mixed nature, being partly animal and partly vegetable; their animals are wild, and therefore ea&s;y of dige&s;tion. As the In|dians are naturally more di&s;po&s;ed to the indolent em|ployment of fi&s;hing than hunting in &s;ummer, &s;o we find them living more upon fi&s;h than land animals, in that &s;ea&s;on of the year. Their vegetables con&s;i&s;t of roots and fruits, mild in them&s;elves, or capable of being made &s;o by the action of fire. Although the interior parts of our continent abound with &s;alt &s;prings, yet I cannot find that the Indians u&s;ed &s;alt in their diet, till they were in&s;tructed to do &s;o by the Europeans. The &s;mall quantity of fixed alkali contained in the a&s;hes on which they roa&s;ted their meat, could not add much to its &s;timulating quality. They pre&s;erve their meat from putrefaction, by cutting it into &s;mall pieces, and ex|po&s;ing it in &s;ummer to the &s;un, and in winter to the fro&s;t. In the one ca&s;e its moi&s;ture is di&s;&s;ipated, and in the other &s;o frozen, that it cannot undergo the putrefactive proce&s;s. In dre&s;&s;ing their meat, they are careful to pre&s;erve its juices. They generally prefer it in the form of &s;oups. Hence we find, that among them, the u&s;e of the &s;poon preceded that of the knife and fork. They take the &s;ame pains to pre&s;erve the juice of their meat when they roa&s;t it, by turning it often. The efficacy of this animal juice in di&s;&s;olving meat in the &s;tomach, has not been equalled by any of tho&s;e &s;auces or liquors, which modern luxury has mix|ed with it for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>THE Indians have no &s;et time for eating, but obey the gentle appetites of nature as often as they call them. After whole days &s;pent in the cha&s;e or in war, they often commit tho&s;e exce&s;&s;es in eating, to which long ab&s;tinence cannot fail of prompting them. It is com|mon
<PB N="14" REF="022123_0011_0FB6E8518CEDE7F0">
to &s;ee them &s;pend three or four hours in &s;atisfying their hunger. This is occa&s;ioned not more by the quantity they eat, than by the pains they take in ma&s;|ticating it.</P>
<P>III. WE come now to &s;peak of tho&s;e cu&s;toms which are peculiar to the &s;exes. And, fir&s;t, of tho&s;e which belong to the WOMEN. They are doomed by their hu&s;bands to &s;uch dome&s;tic labor as gives a firmne&s;s to their bodies, bordering upon the ma&s;culine. Their men&s;es &s;eldom being to flow before they are eighteen or twenty years of age, and generally cea&s;e before they are forty. They have them in &s;mall quantities, but at regular intervals. They &s;eldom marry till they are above twenty. The con&s;titution has now acquired a vigor, which enables it the better to &s;upport the con|vul&s;ions of childbearing. This cu&s;tom likewi&s;e guards again&s;t a premature old age. Doctor Bancroft a&s;cribes the haggard looks&mdash;the loo&s;e hanging brea&s;ts&mdash;and the prominent bellies of the Indian women at Guiana, en|tirely to their bearing children too early<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Natural hi&s;tory of Guiana.</NOTE>. Where marriages are unfruitful (which is &s;eldom the ca&s;e) a &s;eparation is obtained by means of an ea&s;y divorce; &s;o that they are unacquainted with the di&s;quietudes which &s;ometimes ari&s;e from barrenne&s;s. During pregnancy, the women are exempted from the more laborious parts of their duty: hence mi&s;carriages rarely happen a|mong them. Nature is their only midwife. Their labors are &s;hort, and accompanied with little pain. Each woman is delivered in a private cabbin, without &s;o much as one of her own &s;ex to attend her. After wa&s;h|ing her&s;elf in cold water, &s;he returns in a few days to her u&s;ual employments; &s;o that &s;he knows nothing of tho&s;e accidents which ari&s;e from the carele&s;&s;ne&s;s or ill
<PB N="15" REF="022123_0012_0FB6E85577B38968">
management of midwives, or tho&s;e weakne&s;&s;es which ari&s;e from a month's confinement in a warm room. It is remarkable that there is hardly a period in the in|terval between the eruption and the cea&s;ing of the men&s;es, in which they are not pregnant, or giving &s;uck. This is the mo&s;t natural &s;tate of the con&s;titu|tion during that interval; and hence we often find it connected with the be&s;t &s;tate of health in the women of civilized nations.</P>
<P>THE cu&s;toms peculiar to the Indian MEN, con&s;i&s;t chiefly in tho&s;e employments which are nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve animal life, and to defend their nation. The&s;e employments are hunting and war, each of which is conducted in a manner that tends to call forth every fibre into exerci&s;e, and to en&s;ure them the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the utmo&s;t po&s;&s;ible health. In times of plenty and peace, we &s;ee them &s;ometimes ri&s;ing from their be|loved indolence, and &s;haking off its influence by the &s;alutary exerci&s;es of dancing and &s;wimming. The In|dian men &s;eldom marry before they are thirty years of age: They no doubt derive con&s;iderable vigor from this cu&s;tom; for while they are &s;ecured by it from the enervating effects of the premature dalliance of love, they may en&s;ure more certain fruitfulne&s;s to their wives, and entail more certain health upon their children. Tacitus de&s;cribes the &s;ame cu&s;tom among the Germans, and attributes to it the &s;ame good effects. <Q>Sera juvenum venus, eoque inexhau&s;ta pubertas; nec virgines fe&s;tinantur; eadem juventa, &s;imilis proceritas, pares validique mi&s;centur; ac robora parentum liberi referunt<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cae&s;ar, in his hi&s;tory of the Gallic war, gives the &s;ame account of the ancient Germans. His words are: "Qui diuti&s;&s;ime impuberes perman&s;erunt, maximam inter &s;uos ferunt laudem: hoc ali &s;taturam, ali vires, nervo&s;que confirmari putant." Lib. vi. xxi.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="022123_0013_0FB6E856E197E638">
AMONG the Indian men, it is deemed a mark of heroi&s;m to bear the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite pain without com|plaining; upon this account they early inure them|&s;elves to burning part of their bodies with fire, or cutting them with &s;harp in&s;truments. No young man can be admitted to the honors of manhood or war, who has not acquitted him&s;elf well in the&s;e trials of patience and fortitude. It is ea&s;y to conceive how much this contributes to give a tone to the nervous &s;y&s;tem, which renders it le&s;s &s;ubject to the occa&s;ional cau&s;es of di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>IV. WE come now to &s;peak of tho&s;e cu&s;toms which are common to both &s;exes: The&s;e are PAINT|ING, and the u&s;e of the COLD BATH. The practice of anointing the body with oil is common to the &s;a|vages of all countries; in warm climates it is &s;aid to promote longevity, by checking exce&s;&s;ive per&s;piration. The Indians generally u&s;e bears grea&s;e mixed with a clay, which bears the greate&s;t re&s;emblance to the co|lor of their &s;kins. This pigment &s;erves to le&s;&s;en the &s;en&s;ibility of the extremities of the nerves; it more|over fortifies them again&s;t the action of tho&s;e exha|lations, which we &s;hall mention hereafter, as a con|&s;iderable &s;ource of their di&s;ea&s;es. The COLD BATH likewi&s;e fortifies the body, and renders it le&s;s &s;ubject to tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es which ari&s;e from the extremes and vici&s;&s;itudes of heat and cold. We &s;hall &s;peak here|after of the Indian manner of u&s;ing it.</P>
<P>THE &s;tate of &s;ociety among the Indians excludes the influence of mo&s;t of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions which di&s;order the body. The turbulent effects of anger are con|cealed in deep and la&s;ting re&s;entments. Envy and ambition are excluded by their equality of power and
<PB N="17" REF="022123_0014_0FB6E858529602C8">
property. Nor is it nece&s;&s;ary that the perfections of the whole &s;ex &s;hould be a&s;cribed to one, to induce them to marry. <Q>The weakne&s;s of love (&s;ays Doc|tor Adam Smith) which is &s;o much indulged in ages of humanity and politene&s;s, is regarded among &s;a|vages as the mo&s;t unpardonable effeminacy. A young man would think him&s;elf di&s;graced forever, if he &s;howed the lea&s;t preference of one woman above another, or did not expre&s;s the mo&s;t com|plete indifference, both about the time when, and the per&s;on to whom he was to be married.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Theory of moral &s;entiments.</NOTE></Q> Thus are they exempted from tho&s;e violent or la&s;ting di&s;|ea&s;es, which accompany the &s;everal &s;tages of &s;uch pa&s;&s;ions in both &s;exes among civilized nations.</P>
<P>IT is remarkable that there are no deformed In|dians. Some have &s;u&s;pected from this circum&s;tance, that they put their deformed children to death; but nature here acts the part of an unnatural mother. The &s;everity of the Indian manners de&s;troys them<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Since the intercour&s;e of the white people with the Indians, we find &s;ome of them deformed in their limbs. This deformity, upon inquiry, appears to be produced by tho&s;e accidents, quarrels, &amp;c. which have been introduced among them by &s;pirituous liquors.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>FROM a review of the cu&s;toms of the Indians, we need not be &s;urpri&s;ed at the &s;tateline&s;s, regularity of features, and dignity of a&s;pect by which they are cha|racterized. Where we ob&s;erve the&s;e among our|&s;elves, there is always a pre&s;umption of their being accompanied with health, and a &s;trong con&s;titution.</P>

A CELEBRATED profe&s;&s;or of anatomy has a&s;&s;erted, that we could not tell by rea&s;oning <HI>a priori,</HI> that the body was mortal, &s;o intimately woven with its tex|ture are the principles of life. Lord Bacon declares, that the only cau&s;e of death which is natural to man, is that from old age; and complains of the imper|fection of phy&s;ic, in not being able to guard the prin|ciple of life, until the whole of the oil that feeds it is con&s;umed. We cannot admit of this propo&s;ition of our noble philo&s;opher. In the inventory of the grave in every country, we find more of the &s;poils of youth and manhood than of age. This mu&s;t be attributed to moral as well as phy&s;ical cau&s;es.</P>
<P>WE need only recollect the cu&s;tom among the In|dians, of &s;leeping in the open air in a variable cli|mate&mdash;the alternate actions of heat and cold upon their bodies, to which the warmth of their cabbins expo&s;es them&mdash;their long marches&mdash;their exce&s;&s;ive exerci&s;e&mdash;their intemperance in eating, to which their long fa&s;t|ing, and their public fea&s;ts naturally prompt them; and, la&s;tly, the vicinity of their habitations to the banks of rivers, in order to di&s;cover the empire of di&s;ea&s;es among them in every &s;tage of their lives. They have in vain attempted to elude the general laws of mortality, while their mode of life &s;ubjects them to the&s;e remote, but certain cau&s;es of di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>FROM what we know of the action of the&s;e poten|tiae nocentes upon the human body, it will hardly be nece&s;&s;ary to appeal to facts to determine that FEVERS con&s;titute the only di&s;ea&s;es among the Indians. The&s;e fevers are occa&s;ioned by the &s;en&s;ible and in&s;en&s;ible qualities of the air. Tho&s;e which are produced by cold, are of the inflammatory kind, &s;uch as pleuri&s;ies,
<PB N="19" REF="022123_0016_0FB6E85F335E15E0">
peripneumonies, and rheumati&s;ms. Tho&s;e which are produced by the in&s;en&s;ible qualities of the air, or by putrid exhalations, are intermitting, putrid, and in|flammatory, according as the exhalations are combined with more or le&s;s heat or cold. The DYSENTERY (which is an Indian di&s;ea&s;e) comes under the cla&s;s of fevers. It is the febris introver&s;a of Dr. Sydenham.</P>
<P>THE Indians are &s;ubject to ANIMAL and VEGE|TABLE POISONS. The effects of the&s;e upon the body, are in &s;ome degree analogous to the exhalations we have mentioned. When they do not bring on &s;udden death, they produce, according to their ma|lignity, either an inflammatory or putrid fever.</P>
<P>THE SMALL POX and the VENEREAL DISEASE were communicated to the Indians in North-America by the Europeans. Nor can I find that they were ever &s;ubject to the SCURVY. Whether this was ob|viated by their method of pre&s;erving their fle&s;h, or by their mixing it at all times with vegetables, I &s;hall not undertake to determine.

The whole of the di&s;ea&s;es we have mention|ed, raged at one time in all the countries of Europe. In the ninth century there were 19,000 ho&s;pitals for lepers only, in Chri&s;tendom. Lewis VIII. king of France, in the year 1227, bequeathed legacies to 2000 leprous ho&s;|pitals in his own kingdom.

Pontoppidan's natural hi&s;tory of Norway. Between the years 1006 and 1680, we read of the plague being epidemic fifty-two times throughout all Europe. The &s;ituation of Europe is well known during the fourteenth century: every country was in arms; agriculture was neglected; nouri&s;hment of all kinds was &s;canty and un|whole&s;ome; no wonder, therefore, that we read of the plague being four|teen times epidemic in Europe during that period. In proportion as the na|tions of Europe have become civilized, and cultivated the earth, together with the arts of peace, this di&s;order has gradually mitigated. It prevailed only &s;ix times in the &s;ixteenth, and five times in the &s;eventeenth centuries. It made its la&s;t general appearance in the year 1680. It has occa&s;ionally vi|&s;ited &s;everal cities in Europe within the la&s;t century, but has raged with much le&s;s violence than formerly. It is highly probable its very exi&s;tence would be de&s;troyed, could the inhabitants of Turkey (where it is at all times endemic) be prevailed upon to u&s;e the &s;ame precautions to prevent its &s;pread|ing, which have been found &s;ucce&s;sful in other parts of Europe.

I HAVE heard of two or three ca&s;es of the GOUT among the Indians, but it was only among tho&s;e who had learned the u&s;e of rum from the white people. A que&s;tion naturally occurs here, and that is; why does not the gout appear more frequently among that cla&s;s of people, who con&s;ume the greate&s;t quantity of rum among our&s;elves? To this I an&s;wer, that the effects of this liquor upon tho&s;e enfeebled people, are too &s;udden and violent, to admit of their being thrown upon the extremities; as we know them to be among the Indians. They appear only in vi&s;ceral ob&s;tructi|ons, and a complicated train of chronic di&s;ea&s;es. Thus putrid mia&s;mata are &s;ometimes too &s;trong to bring on a fever, but produce in&s;tant debility and death. The gout is &s;eldom heard of in Ru&s;&s;ia, Denmark, or Po|land. Is this occa&s;ioned by the vigor of con&s;titution peculiar to the inhabitants of tho&s;e northern countries? or is it cau&s;ed by their exce&s;&s;ive u&s;e of &s;pirituous liquors, which produce the &s;ame chronic complaints
<PB N="22" REF="022123_0019_0FB6E86BD0A1D3E8">
among them, which we &s;aid were common among the lower cla&s;s of people in this country? The &s;imilarity of their di&s;ea&s;es makes the la&s;t of the&s;e &s;uppo&s;itions the mo&s;t probable. The effects of wine, like tyranny in a well formed government, are felt fir&s;t in the ex|tremities; while &s;pirits, like a bold invader, &s;eize at once upon the vitals of the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>AFTER much inquiry, I have not been able to find a &s;ingle in&s;tance of MADNESS, MELANCHOLY, or FATUITY among the Indians; nor can I find any ac|counts of <HI>di&s;ea&s;es</HI> from WORMS among them. Worms are common to mo&s;t animals; they produce di&s;ea&s;es only in weak, or increa&s;e them in &s;trong con&s;titutions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Indian children are not exempted from worms. It is common with the Indians, when a fever in their children is a&s;cribed by the white people to worms, (from their being di&s;charged occa&s;ionally in their &s;tools) to &s;ay <Q>the fever makes the worms come, and not the worms the fever.</Q></NOTE>. Hence they have no place in the no&s;ological &s;y&s;tems of phy&s;ic. Nor does DENTITION appear to be a di&s;or|der among the Indians. The facility with which the healthy children of healthy parents cut their teeth, among civilized nations, gives us rea&s;on to conclude that the Indian children never &s;uffer from this quarter.</P>

<P>THE employments of the Indians &s;ubject them to many accidents; hence we &s;ometimes read of WOUNDS, FRACTURES, and LUXATIONS among them.</P>
<P>HAVING thus pointed out the natural di&s;ea&s;es of the Indians, and &s;hown what di&s;orders are foreign to them; we may venture to conclude, that FEVERS,
<PB N="23" REF="022123_0020_0FB6E86D51CF5B50">
OLD AGE, CASUALTIES and WAR are the only na|tural outlets of human life. War is nothing but a di&s;temper; it is founded in the imperfection of politi|cal bodies, ju&s;t as fevers are founded on the weakne&s;s of the animal body.&mdash;Providence in the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es &s;eems to act like a mild legi&s;lature, which mitigates the &s;e|verity of death, by inflicting it in a manner the lea&s;t painful upon the whole, to the patient and the &s;urvi|vors.</P>
<P>LET us now inquire into the REMEDIES of the In|dians. The&s;e, like their di&s;ea&s;es, are &s;imple, and few in number. Among the fir&s;t of them we &s;hall men|tion the POWERS of NATURE. Fevers we &s;aid for|merly, con&s;tituted the chief of the di&s;ea&s;es among the Indians; they are likewi&s;e, in the hands of nature, the principal in&s;truments to remove the evils which threaten her di&s;&s;olution; but the event of the&s;e efforts of nature, no doubt, &s;oon convinced the Indians of the danger of tru&s;ting her in all ca&s;es; and hence in the earlie&s;t accounts we have of their manners, we read of per&s;ons who were intru&s;ted with the office of phy|&s;icians.</P>
<P>IT will be difficult to find out the exact order in which the Indian remedies were &s;ugge&s;ted by nature, or di&s;covered by art; nor will it be ea&s;y to arrange them in proper order. I &s;hall however attempt it, by reducing them to NATURAL and ARTIFICIAL.</P>
<P>To the cla&s;s of NATURAL REMEDIES belongs the Indian practice, of ab&s;tracting from their patients all kinds of &s;timulating aliment. The compliance of the Indians with this dictate of nature, in the early &s;tage of a di&s;order, no doubt, prevents in many ca&s;es, their
<PB N="24" REF="022123_0021_0FB6E86EDDC932C8">
being obliged to u&s;e any other remedy. They follow nature &s;till clo&s;er, in allowing their patients to drink plentifully of cold water; this being the only liquor a patient calls for in a fever.</P>
<P>SWEATING is likewi&s;e a natural remedy. It was probably &s;ugge&s;ted by ob&s;erving fevers to be terminated by it. I &s;hall not inquire how far the&s;e &s;weats are e&s;&s;ential to the cri&s;is of a fever. The Indian mode of procuring this evacuation is as follows: the patient is confined in a clo&s;e tent, or wigwam, over a hole in the earth, in which a red hot &s;tone is placed; a quantity of water is thrown upon this &s;tone, which in&s;tantly involves the patient in a cloud of vapor and &s;weat; in this &s;ituation he ru&s;hes out, and plunges him&s;elf into a river; from whence he retires to his bed. If the remedy has been u&s;ed with &s;ucce&s;s, he ri&s;es from his bed in four and twenty hours, perfectly recovered from his indi&s;po&s;ition. This remedy is u&s;ed not only to cure fevers, but to remove that unea&s;ine&s;s which ari&s;es from fatigue of body.</P>
<P>A THIRD natural remedy among the Indians, is PURGING. The fruits of the earth, the fle&s;h of birds, and other animals feeding upon particular vegetables, and above all, the &s;pontaneous efforts of nature, early led the Indians to perceive the nece&s;&s;ity and advantages of this evacuation.</P>
<P>VOMITS con&s;titute their fourth natural remedy. They were probably like the former, &s;ugge&s;ted by na|ture, and accident. The ipecacuana is one of the many roots they employ for this purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="022123_0022_0FB6E873DC7C82D0">
THE ARTIFICIAL REMEDIES made u&s;e of by the Indians, are BLEEDING, CAUSTICS, and ASTRIN|GENT medicines. They confine bleeding entirely to the part affected. To know that opening a vein in the arm, or foot, would relieve a pain in the head, or &s;ide, &s;uppo&s;es &s;ome knowledge of the animal oecono|my, and therefore marks an advanced period in the hi&s;tory of medicine.</P>
<P>SHARP &s;tones and thorns are the in&s;truments they u&s;e to procure a di&s;charge of blood.</P>
<P>WE have an account of the Indians u&s;ing &s;omething like a POTENTIAL CAUSTIC, in ob&s;tinate pains. It con&s;i&s;ts of a piece of rotten wood called <HI>punk,</HI> which they place upon the part affected, and afterwards &s;et it on fire; the fire gradually con&s;umes the wood, and its a&s;hes burn a hole in the fle&s;h.</P>
<P>THE undue efforts of nature, in tho&s;e fevers which are connected with a diarrhoea, or dy&s;entery, together with tho&s;e haemorrhages to which their mode of life expo&s;ed them, nece&s;&s;arily led them to an early di&s;co|very of &s;ome ASTRINGENT VEGETABLES. I am uncertain whether the Indians rely upon a&s;tringent, or any other vegetables, for the cure of the intermitting fever. This di&s;ea&s;e among them probably requires no other remedies than the cold bath, or cold air. Its greater ob&s;tinacy, as well as frequency among our|&s;elves, mu&s;t be &s;ought for in the greater feeblene&s;s of our con&s;titutions; and in that change which our coun|try has undergone, from meadows, mill-dams, and the cutting down of woods, whereby morbid exhala|tions have been multiplied, and their pa&s;&s;age rendered more free, through every part of the country.</P>

THIS is a &s;hort account of the remedies of the In|dians. If they are &s;imple, they are like their elo|quence, full of &s;trength; if they are few in number, they are accommodated, as their languages are to their ideas, to the whole of their di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>WE &s;aid formerly that the Indians were &s;ubject to ACCIDENTS, &s;uch as wounds, fractures, and the like. In the&s;e ca&s;es, nature performs the office of a &s;urgeon. We may judge of her qualifications for this office, by ob&s;erving the marks of wounds, and fractures, which are &s;ometimes di&s;covered on wild animals. But fur|ther, what is the practice of our modern &s;urgeons in the&s;e ca&s;es? Is it not to lay a&s;ide pla&s;ters and ointments, and tru&s;t the whole to nature? Tho&s;e ulcers which re|quire the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of mercury, bark, and a particular regimen, are unknown to the Indians.</P>
<P>THE HAEMORRHAGES which &s;ometimes follow their wounds, are re&s;trained, by plunging them&s;elves into cold water, and thereby producing a con&s;triction upon the bleeding ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>THEIR practice of attempting to recover DROWN|ED PEOPLE, is irrational and un&s;ucce&s;sful. It con|&s;i&s;ts in &s;u&s;pending the patient by the heels, in order that the water may flow from his mouth. This prac|tice is founded on a belief, that the patient dies from &s;wallowing an exce&s;&s;ive quantity of water. But mo|dern ob&s;ervation teaches us, that drowned people die from another cau&s;e. This di&s;covery has &s;ugge&s;ted a method of cure, directly oppo&s;ite to that in u&s;e among the Indians; and has &s;hown us that the practice of &s;u&s;pending by the heels, is hurtful.</P>

<P>WE have heard much of their &s;pecific antidotes to the VENEREAL DISEASE. In the accounts of the&s;e antivenereal medicines, &s;ome abatement &s;hould be made for that love of the marvellous, and of novelty, which are apt to creep into the writings of travellers and phy&s;icians. How many medicines which were once thought infallible in this di&s;order, are now reject|ed from the materia medica! I have found upon in|quiry, that the Indians always a&s;&s;i&s;t their medicines in this di&s;ea&s;e, by a regimen which promotes per&s;piration. Should we allow that mercury acts as a &s;pecific in de|&s;troying this di&s;order, it does not follow that it is proof again&s;t the efficacy of medicines which act more me|chanically upon the body.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">I cannot help &s;u&s;pecting the antivenereal qualities of the lobelia, ceano|thus and ranunculus, &s;poken of by Mr. Kalm, in the memoirs of the Swe|di&s;h academy.

THERE cannot be a &s;tronger mark of the imper|fect &s;tate of knowledge in medicine among the Indians, than their method of treating the SMALL POX. We are told that they plunge them&s;elves in cold water in the beginning of the di&s;order, and that it generally proves fatal to them.</P>
<P>TRAVELLERS &s;peak in high terms of the Indian ANTIDOTES to POISONS. We mu&s;t remember, that many things have been thought poi&s;onous, which later experience hath proved to po&s;&s;e&s;s no unwhole&s;ome quality. Moreover, the uncertainty and variety in the operation of poi&s;ons, render it extremely difficult to fix the certainty of their antidotes, to them. How many &s;pecifics have derived their credit for prevent|ing the hydrophobia, from per&s;ons being wounded by animals, who were not in a &s;ituation to produce that di&s;order!

<P>I HAVE heard of their performing &s;everal remark|able cures upon STIFF JOINTS, by an infu&s;ion of certain herbs in water. The mixture of &s;everal herbs together in this infu&s;ion calls in que&s;tion the &s;pecific efficacy of each of them. I cannot help attributing the whole &s;ucce&s;s of this remedy to the great heat of the water in which the herbs were boiled, and to its being applied for a long time to the part affected. We find the &s;ame medicine to vary frequently in its &s;uc|ce&s;s, according to its &s;trength, or to the continuance of its application. De Haen attributes the good ef|fects of electricity, entirely to its being u&s;ed for &s;eve|ral months.</P>

There cannot be a &s;tronger proof of their ignorance of proper remedies for new or difficult di&s;ea&s;es, than their having recour&s;e to enchantment.

<P>NATIONS differ in their degrees of civilization. We &s;hall &s;elect one for the &s;ubject of our inquiries which is mo&s;t familiar to us; I mean the Briti&s;h na|tion. Here we behold &s;ubordination and cla&s;&s;es of mankind e&s;tabli&s;hed by government, commerce, ma|nufactures,
<PB N="31" REF="022123_0028_0FB6E887C8EF8960">
and certain cu&s;toms common to mo&s;t of the civilized nations of Europe. We &s;hall trace the origin of their di&s;ea&s;es through their cu&s;toms, in the &s;ame manner as we did tho&s;e of the Indians.</P>
<P>I. IT will be &s;ufficient to name the degrees of heat, the improper aliment, the light dre&s;&s;es, and the pre|mature &s;tudies children are expo&s;ed to, in order to &s;how the ample &s;cope for di&s;ea&s;es, which is added to the original defect of &s;tamina they derive from their ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>II. CIVILIZATION ri&s;es in its demands upon the health of women. Their fa&s;hions; their dre&s;s and diet; their eager pur&s;uits and ardent enjoyment of plea&s;ure; their indolence and undue evacuations in pregnancy; their cordials, hot regimen and neglect or u&s;e of art, in child-birth, are all &s;o many inlets to di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>HUMANITY would fain be &s;ilent, while philo&s;ophy calls upon us to mention the effects of intere&s;ted mar|riages, and of di&s;appointments in love, increa&s;ed by that concealment which the tyranny of cu&s;tom has impo&s;ed upon the &s;ex<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Married women are more healthy and long-lived than &s;ingle women. The regi&s;ters, examined by Mr. Muret, confirm this ob&s;ervation; and &s;how particularly, that of equal numbers of &s;ingle and married women between fifteen and twenty-five years of age, more of the former died than of the lat|ter, in the proportion of two to one: the con&s;equence, therefore, of follow|ing nature, mu&s;t be favourable to health among the female &s;ex." Supple|ment to Price's Ob&s;ervations on Rever&s;ionary Payments. p. 357.</NOTE>. Each of the&s;e exaggerates the natural, and increa&s;es the number of artificial di&s;ea&s;es among women.</P>
<P>III. THE di&s;ea&s;es introduced by civilization extend them&s;elves through every cla&s;s and profe&s;&s;ion among
<PB N="32" REF="022123_0029_0FB6E889114FCB10">
men. How fatal are the effects of idlene&s;s and in|temperance among the rich, and of hard labor and penury among the poor! What pallid looks are con|tracted by the votaries of &s;cience from hanging over the "&s;ickly taper!" How many di&s;ea&s;es are entailed upon manufacturers, by the materials in which they work, and the po&s;ture of their bodies! What monk|i&s;h di&s;ea&s;es do we ob&s;erve from monki&s;h continence, and monki&s;h vices! We pa&s;s over the increa&s;e of ac|cidents from building, &s;ailing, riding, and the like. War, as if too &s;low in de&s;troying the human &s;pecies, calls in a train of di&s;ea&s;es peculiar to civilized nations. What havoc have the corruption and monopoly of provi&s;ions, a damp &s;oil, and an unwhole&s;ome &s;ky, made in a few days in an army! The atchievements of Briti&s;h valor at the Havannah, in the la&s;t war, were obtained at the expence of 9,000 men, 7,000 of whom peri&s;hed with the We&s;t-India fever<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The modern writers upon the di&s;ea&s;es of armies, wonder that the Greek and Roman phy&s;icians have left us nothing upon that &s;ubject.

The di&s;coveries in geography, by ex|tending the field of war, expo&s;e &s;oldiers to many di&s;ea&s;es from long voyages, and a <HI>&s;udden</HI> change of climate; which were unknown to the armies of for|mer ages. Moreover, the form of the weapons, and the variety in the mi|litary exerci&s;es of the Grecian and Roman armies, gave a vigor to the con&s;ti|tution, which can never be acquired by the u&s;e of mu&s;kets and artillery.</NOTE>. Even our mo|dern di&s;coveries in geography, by extending the em|pire of commerce, have likewi&s;e extended the empire of di&s;ea&s;es. What de&s;olation have the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Indies made of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects! It has been found upon a nice calculation, that only ten of an hundred Europeans, live above &s;even years after they arrive in the i&s;land of Jamaica.</P>
<P>IV. IT would take up too much of our time to point out all the cu&s;toms both <HI>phy&s;ical</HI> and <HI>moral,</HI>
<PB N="33" REF="022123_0030_0FB6E88AABF1D508">
which influence di&s;ea&s;es among both &s;exes. The for|mer have engendered the feeds of di&s;ea&s;es in the human body it&s;elf; hence the origin of catarrhs, jail and miliary fevers, with a long train of contagious di&s;|orders, which compo&s;e &s;o great a part of our books of medicine. The latter likewi&s;e have a large &s;hare in producing di&s;ea&s;es. I am not one of tho&s;e modern philo&s;ophers, who derive the vices of mankind from the influence of civilization; but I am &s;afe in a&s;&s;ert|ing, that their number and malignity increa&s;e with the refinements of poli&s;hed life. To prove this, we need only &s;urvey a &s;cene too familiar to affect us: it is a bedlam; which inju&s;tice, inhumanity, avarice, pride, vanity, and ambition, have filled with inhabitants.</P>
<P>THUS have we briefly pointed out the cu&s;toms which influence the di&s;ea&s;es of civilized nations. It remains now that we take notice of their di&s;ea&s;es. Without naming the many new fevers, fluxes, haemorr|hages, &s;wellings from water, wind, fle&s;h, fat, pus and blood; foulne&s;&s;es on the &s;kin from cancers, lepro&s;y, yaws, poxes, and itch; and la&s;tly, the gout, the hy&s;teria, and the hypochondria&s;is, in all their variety of known and unknown &s;hapes; I &s;hall &s;um up all that is ne|ce&s;&s;ary upon this &s;ubject, by adding, that the number of di&s;ea&s;es which belong to civilized nations, accord|ing to Doctor Cullen's no&s;ology, amounts to 1387; the &s;ingle cla&s;s of nervous di&s;ea&s;es form 612 of this number.</P>
<P>BEFORE we proceed to &s;peak of the remedies of civilized nations, we &s;hall examine into the abilities of NATURE in curing their di&s;ea&s;es. We found her active and &s;ucce&s;sful in curing the di&s;ea&s;es of the In|dians. Is her &s;trength, wi&s;dom, or benignty, equal to
<PB N="34" REF="022123_0031_0FB6E890AD1B6CA0">
the increa&s;e of tho&s;e dangers which threaten her di&s;|&s;olution among civilized nations? In order to an&s;wer this que&s;tion, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to explain the mean|ing of the term nature.</P>
<P>BY NATURE, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, I under&s;tand nothing but <HI>phy&s;ical nece&s;&s;ity.</HI> This at once excludes every thing like intelligence from her operations: the&s;e are all performed in obedience to the &s;ame laws which govern vegetation in plants and the inte&s;tine motions of fo&s;&s;ils. They are as truly mechanical as the laws of gravitation, electricity, or magneti&s;m. A &s;hip when laid on her broad&s;ide by a wave, or a &s;udden bla&s;t of wind, ri&s;es by the &s;imple laws of her mecha|ni&s;m; but &s;uppo&s;e this &s;hip to be attacked by fire, or a water-&s;pout, we are not to call in que&s;tion the &s;kill of the &s;hip-builder, if &s;he is con&s;umed by the one, or &s;unk by the other. In like manner, the Author of nature hath furni&s;hed the body with powers to pre|&s;erve it&s;elf from its natural enemies; but when it is attacked by tho&s;e civil foes which are bred by the pe|culiar cu&s;toms of civilization, it re&s;embles a company of Indians, armed with bows and arrows, again&s;t the complicated and deadly machinery of fire-arms. To place this &s;ubject in a proper light, we &s;hall deliver a hi&s;tory of the operations of nature in a few of the di&s;ea&s;es of civilized nations.</P>
<P>I. THERE are ca&s;es in which nature is &s;till &s;uc|ce&s;sful in curing di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>IN fevers &s;he &s;till deprives us of our appetite for animal food, and imparts to us a de&s;ire for cool air and cold water.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="022123_0032_0FB6E8921F3015C8">
IN haemorrhages &s;he produces a faintine&s;s, which occa&s;ions a coagulum in the open ve&s;&s;els; &s;o that the further pa&s;&s;age of blood through them is ob&s;tructed.</P>
<P>IN wounds of the fle&s;h and bones, &s;he di&s;charges foreign matter by exciting an inflammation, and &s;up|plies the wa&s;te of both with new fle&s;h and bone.</P>
<P>II. THERE are ca&s;es where the efforts of nature are too feeble to do &s;ervice, as in putrid and nervous fevers.</P>
<P>III. THERE are ca&s;es where the efforts of nature are over-proportioned to the &s;trength of the di&s;ea&s;e, as in the cholera morbus and dy&s;entery.</P>
<P>IV. THERE are ca&s;es where nature is idle, as in the atonic &s;tages of the gout, the cancer, the epilep&s;y, the mania, the venereal di&s;ea&s;e, the apoplexy, and the tetanus.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hoffman de hypothe&s;ium medicarum damno, &s;ect. xv.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>V. THERE are ca&s;es in which nature does mi&s;chief. She wa&s;tes her&s;elf with an unnece&s;&s;ary fever in a drop&s;y and con&s;umption. She throws a plethora upon the brain and lungs. She ends a pleuri&s;y and peripneu|mony in a vomica, or empyema. She creates an un|natural appetite for food in the hypochondriac di&s;or|der. And la&s;tly, &s;he drives the melancholy patient to &s;olitude, where, by brooding over the &s;ubject of his infanity, he increa&s;es his di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>WE are accu&s;tomed to hear of the &s;alutary kind|ne&s;s of nature in alarming us with pain, to prompt us to &s;eek for a remedy. But,</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="022123_0033_0FB6E8938BBFB4A8">
VI. THERE are ca&s;es in which &s;he refu&s;es to &s;end this harbinger of the evils which threaten her, as in the aneuri&s;m, &s;cirrhus, and &s;tone in the bladder.</P>
<P>VII. THERE are ca&s;es where the pain is not pro|portioned to the danger, as in the tetanus, con&s;ump|tion, and drop&s;y of the head. And,</P>
<P>VIII. THERE are ca&s;es where the pain is over-proportioned to the danger, as in the paronychia and tooth-ach.</P>
<P>THIS is a &s;hort account of the operations of na|ture, in the di&s;ea&s;es of civilized nations. A lunatic might as well plead again&s;t the &s;eque&s;tration of his e&s;tate, becau&s;e he once enjoyed the full exerci&s;e of his rea&s;on, or becau&s;e he &s;till had lucid intervals, as nature be exempted from the charges we have brought again&s;t her.</P>
<P>BUT this &s;ubject will receive &s;trength from con&s;i|dering the REMEDIES of civilized nations. All the products of the vegetable, fo&s;&s;il, and animal kingdoms, tortured by heat and mixture into an almo&s;t infinite variety of forms; bleeding, cupping, artificial drains by &s;etons, i&s;&s;ues and bli&s;ters; exerci&s;e, active and pa&s;&s;ive; voyages and journies; baths, warm and cold; waters &s;aline, a&euml;rial and mineral; food by weight and mea&s;ure; the royal touch; enchantment; miracles; in a word, the combined di&s;coveries of natural hi&s;tory and philo&s;ophy, united into a &s;y&s;tem of materia medica, all &s;how, that although phy&s;icians are in &s;peculation the &s;ervants, yet in practice they are the ma&s;ters of nature. The whole of their remedies &s;eem contrived
<PB N="37" REF="022123_0034_0FB6E895143D6580">
on purpo&s;e to arou&s;e, a&s;&s;i&s;t, re&s;train, and controul her operations.</P>
<P>THERE are &s;ome truths like certain liquors, which require &s;trong heads to bear them. I feel my&s;elf pro|tected from the prejudices of vulgar minds, when I reflect that I am delivering the&s;e &s;entiments in a &s;ociety of philo&s;ophers.</P>
<P>LET us now take a COMPARATIVE VIEW of the di&s;ea&s;es and remedies of the Indians, with tho&s;e of ci|vilized nations. We &s;hall begin with their di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>IN our account of the di&s;ea&s;es of the Indians we beheld death executing his commi&s;&s;ion, it is true; but then his dart was hid in a mantle, under which he conceal|ed his &s;hape. But among civilized nations we behold him multiplying his weapons in proportion to the num|ber of organs and functions in the body; and point|ing each of them in &s;uch a manner, as to render his me&s;&s;engers more terrible than him&s;elf.</P>
<P>WE &s;aid formerly that fevers con&s;tituted the chief di&s;ea&s;es of the Indians. According to Doctor Syden|ham's computation, above 66,000 out of 100,000 died of fevers in London about 100 years ago; but fevers now con&s;titute but a little more than one-tenth part of the di&s;ea&s;es of that city. Out of 21,780 per&s;ons who died in London between December 1770 and Decem|ber 1771, only 2273 died of &s;imple fevers. I have more than once heard Doctor Huck complain, that he could find no marks of epidemic fevers in London as de&s;cribed by Doctor Sydenham. London has under|gone a revolution in its manners and cu&s;toms &s;ince Doctor Sydenham's time. New di&s;ea&s;es, the offspring
<PB N="38" REF="022123_0035_0FB6E89C4F3762C0">
of luxury, have &s;upplanted fevers; and the few that are left, appear &s;o complicated with other di&s;ea&s;es, that their connection can no longer be di&s;covered with an epidemic con&s;titution of the year. The pleuri&s;y and peripneumony, tho&s;e inflammatory fevers of &s;trong con&s;titutions, are now lo&s;t in catarrhs, or colds; which in&s;tead of challenging the powers of nature or art to a fair combat, in&s;en&s;ibly undermine the con&s;titution, and bring on an incurable con&s;umption. Out of 22,434 who died between December 1769 and the &s;ame month in 1770, 4594 peri&s;hed with that <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> di&s;order. Our countryman, Doctor Maclurg, has ventured to foretel that the gout will be lo&s;t in a few years, in a train of hypochondriac, hy&s;teric and bili|ous di&s;orders. In like manner, may we not look for a &s;ea&s;on when fevers, the natural di&s;ea&s;es of the hu|man body, will be lo&s;t in an inundation of artificial di&s;ea&s;es, brought on by the modi&s;h practices of mo|dern civilization?</P>
<P>IT may not be improper to compare the PROGNOSIS of the Indians, in di&s;ea&s;es, with that of civilized na|tions, before we take a comparative view of their re|medies.</P>
<P>THE Indians are &s;aid to be &s;ucce&s;sful in predicting the events of di&s;ea&s;es. While di&s;ea&s;es are &s;imple, the marks which di&s;tingui&s;h them, or characterize their &s;everal &s;tages, are generally uniform and obvious to the mo&s;t indifferent ob&s;erver. The&s;e marks afford &s;o much certainty, that the Indians &s;ometimes kill their phy&s;icians for a fal&s;e progno&s;is, charging the death of the patient to their carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, or ignorance. They e&s;timate the danger of their patients by their degrees of appetite; while an Indian is able to eat, he is looked
<PB N="39" REF="022123_0036_0FB6E89D6F057DA8">
upon as free from danger. But when we con&s;ider the number and variety in the &s;igns of di&s;ea&s;es, among ci|vilized nations, together with the &s;hortne&s;s of life, the fallacy of memory, and the uncertainty of ob&s;ervation: where &s;hall we find a phy&s;ician willing to ri&s;k his re|putation, much le&s;s his life, upon the prediction of the event of our acute di&s;ea&s;es? We can derive no ad|vantage from the &s;imple &s;ign, by which the Indians e&s;timate the danger of their patients; for we daily &s;ee a want of appetite for food in di&s;ea&s;es which are attend|ed with no danger; and we &s;ometimes ob&s;erve an un|u&s;ual degree of this appetite to precede the agonies of death. I honor the name of HIPPOCRATES: But forgive me ye votaries of antiquity, if I attempt to pluck a few grey hairs from his venerable head. I was once an idolater at his altar, nor did I turn apo&s;tate from his wor&s;hip, till I was taught, that not a tenth part of his progno&s;tics corre&s;ponded with modern ex|perience, or ob&s;ervation. The pul&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Doctor Cullen u&s;ed to inform his pupils, that after forty years experi|ence, he could find no relation between his ob&s;ervations on the pul&s;e, and tho&s;e made by Doctor Solano. The climate and cu&s;toms of the people in Spain being &s;o different from the climate and cu&s;toms of the pre&s;ent inhabi|tants of Britain, may account for the diver&s;ity of their ob&s;ervations. Doctor Heberden's remarks upon the pul&s;e, in the &s;econd volume of the Medical Tran&s;actions, are calculated to &s;how how little the i&s;&s;ue of di&s;ea&s;es can be learned from it.</NOTE>, urine, and &s;weats, from which the principal &s;igns of life and death have been taken, are &s;o variable in mo&s;t of the acute di&s;ea&s;es of civilized nations, that the wi&s;e&s;t phy&s;icians have in &s;ome mea&s;ure excluded the progno&s;is from being a part of their profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I AM here in&s;en&s;ibly led to make an apology for the in&s;tability of the theories and practice of phy&s;ic. The theory of phy&s;ic is founded upon the laws of the animal oeconomy. The&s;e (unlike the laws of the mind, or the
<PB N="40" REF="022123_0037_0FB6E8A0FAF5AC78">
common laws of matter) do not appear at once, but are gradually brought to light by the phaenomena of di&s;ea&s;es. The &s;ucce&s;s of nature, in curing the &s;imple di&s;ea&s;es of Saxony, laid the foundation for the ANIMA MEDICA of Doctor STAHL. The endemics of Hol|land<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>"The &s;curvy is very frequent in Holland; and draws its origin partly from their &s;trong food, &s;ea-fi&s;h, and &s;moaked fle&s;h, and partly from their den&s;e and moi&s;t air, together with their bad water." Hoffman on Endemi|al Di&s;tempers.</P>
<P>"We are now in North-Holland; and I have never &s;een, among &s;o few people, &s;o many infected with the lepro&s;y as here. They &s;ay the rea&s;on is, becau&s;e they eat &s;o much fi&s;h." Howell's Familiar Letters.</P></NOTE> led Doctor BOERHAAVE to &s;eek for the cau&s;es of all di&s;ea&s;es in the FLUIDS. And the univer&s;al pre|valence of the di&s;ea&s;es of the NERVES, in Great-Bri|tain, led Doctor CULLEN to di&s;cover their peculiar laws, and to found a SYSTEM upon them; a &s;y&s;tem, which will probably la&s;t till &s;ome new di&s;ea&s;es are let loo&s;e upon the human &s;pecies, which &s;hall unfold other laws of the animal oeconomy.</P>
<P>IT is in con&s;equence of this fluctuation in the prin|ciples and practice of phy&s;ic, being &s;o nece&s;&s;arily con|nected with the changes in the cu&s;toms of civilized na|tions, that old and young phy&s;icians &s;o often di&s;agree in their opinions and practices. And it is by attending to the con&s;tant changes in the&s;e cu&s;toms of civilized na|tions, that tho&s;e phy&s;icians have generally become the mo&s;t eminent, who have &s;oone&s;t emancipated them|&s;elves from the tyranny of the &s;chools of phy&s;ic; and have occa&s;ionally accommodated their principles and practice to the changes in di&s;ea&s;es<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">We may learn from the&s;e ob&s;ervations, the great impropriety of tho&s;e Egyptian laws which oblige phy&s;icians to adopt, in all ca&s;es, the pre&s;cripti|ons which had been collected, and approved of, by the phy&s;icians of former ages. Every change in the cu&s;toms of civilized nations, produces a change in their di&s;ea&s;es, which calls for a change in their remedies. What havoc would plentiful bleeding, purging, and &s;mall beer, formerly u&s;ed with &s;o much &s;ucce&s;s by Dr. Sydenham in the cure of fevers, now make upon the en|feebled citizens of London! The fevers of the &s;ame, and of more &s;outhern latitudes, &s;till admit of &s;uch antiphlogi&s;tic remedies. In the room of the&s;e, bark, wine, and other cordial medicines, are pre&s;cribed in London in almo&s;t every kind of fever</NOTE>. This variety in
<PB N="41" REF="022123_0038_0FB6E8A79C14EB48">
di&s;ea&s;es, which is produced by the changes in the cu&s;|toms of civilized nations, will enable us to account for many of the contradictions which are to be found in authors of equal candor and abilities, who have writ|ten upon the materia medica.</P>
<P>IN forming a comparative view of the REMEDIES of the Indians, with tho&s;e of civilized nations, we &s;hall remark, that the want of &s;ucce&s;s in a medicine is oc|ca&s;ioned by one of the following cau&s;es.</P>
<P>FIRST, our ignorance of the di&s;order. Secondly, an ignorance of a &s;uitable remedy. Thirdly, a want of efficacy in the remedy.</P>
<P>CONSIDERING the violence of the di&s;ea&s;es of the Indians, it is probable their want of &s;ucce&s;s is always occa&s;ioned by a want of efficacy in their medicines. But the ca&s;e is very different among civilized nations. Di&s;&s;ections daily convince us of our ignorance of the &s;eats of di&s;ea&s;es, and cau&s;e us to blu&s;h at our pre&s;crip|tions. What certain or equal remedies have we found for the gout, the epilep&s;y, apoplexy, pal&s;y, drop&s;y of the brain, cancer and con&s;umption? How often are we di&s;appointed in our expectations from the mo&s;t certain and powerful of our remedies, by the negli|gence or ob&s;tinacy of our patients! What mi&s;chief have we not done under the belief of fal&s;e facts (if I may be allowed the expre&s;&s;ion) and fal&s;e theories! We have a&s;&s;i&s;ted in multiplying di&s;ea&s;es.&mdash;We have done more&mdash;we have increa&s;ed their mortality.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="022123_0039_0FB6E8A8AAFDD430">
I SHALL not pau&s;e to beg pardon of the faculty, for acknowledging in this public manner the weakne&s;&s;es of our profe&s;&s;ion. I am pur&s;uing truth, and while I can keep my eye fixed upon my guide, I am indiffe|rent whither I am led, provided &s;he is my leader.</P>
<P>BUT further, the Indian &s;ubmits to his di&s;ea&s;e, without one fearful emotion from his doubtfulne&s;s of its event; and at la&s;t meets his fate without an anxi|ous wi&s;h for futurity; except it is of being admitted to an "equal &s;ky," where
<Q><L>His faithful dog &s;hall bear him company.</L></Q>
But among civilized nations, the influence of a fal&s;e religion in good, and of a true religion in bad men, has converted even the fear of death into a di&s;ea&s;e. It is this original di&s;temper of the imagination which renders the plague mo&s;t fatal, upon its fir&s;t appearance in a country.</P>
<P>UNDER all the&s;e di&s;advantages in the &s;tate of medi|cine, among civilized nations, do more in proportion die of the di&s;ea&s;es peculiar to them, than of fevers, ca&s;ualties and old age, among the Indians? If we take our account from the city of London, we &s;hall find this to be the ca&s;e. Near a twentieth part of its inhabitants peri&s;h one year with another. Nor does the natural increa&s;e of inhabitants &s;upply this yearly wa&s;te. If we judge from the bills of mortality, the city of London contains fewer inhabitants, by &s;everal thou&s;ands, than it did forty years ago.

It does not become us to pry too much into futurity; but if we may judge from the fate of the original natives of Hi&s;paniola, Jamaica, and the provinces on the continent, we may venture to foretel, that, in proportion as the white people mul|tiply, the Indians will dimini&s;h; &s;o that in a few cen|turies they will probably be entirely extirpated<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Even the influence of CHRISTIAN principles has not been able to put a &s;top to the mortality introduced among the Indians, by their intercour&s;e with the Europeans. Dr. Cotton Mather, in a letter to Sir William A&s;hur&s;t, printed in Bo&s;ton in the year 1705, &s;ays, "That about five years before, there were about thirty Indian congregrations in the &s;outhern parts of the province of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay." The &s;ame author, in his hi&s;tory of New-England, &s;ays, "That in the i&s;lands of Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard there were 3000 <HI>adult</HI> Indians, 1600 of whom profe&s;&s;ed the chri&s;tian religi|on."

<P>It may &s;erve to extend our knowledge of di&s;ea&s;es, to remark, that epide|mics were often ob&s;erved to prevail among the Indians in Nantucket, with|out affecting the white people.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT may be &s;aid, that health among the Indians, like in&s;en&s;ibility to cold and hunger, is proportioned to their need of it; and that the le&s;s degrees, or entire want of health, are no interruption to the ordinary bu|&s;ine&s;s of civilized life.</P>

Let us fir&s;t try the force of &s;evere manners. Lycurgus governed more by the&s;e, than by his laws. "Boni mores non bonae leges," according to Tacitus, were the bulwarks of virtue among the ancient Germans.</P>

<P>IV. LET us be cautious what kind of manufactures we admit among us. The rickets made their fir&s;t ap|pearance in the manufacturing towns in England. Doctor Fothergill informed me, that he had often ob|&s;erved, when a pupil, that the greate&s;t part of the chronic patients in the London Ho&s;pital were Spittal-field weavers. I would not be under&s;tood, from the&s;e facts, to di&s;courage tho&s;e manufactures which employ women and children: the&s;e &s;uffer few inconveniencies
<PB N="54" REF="022123_0051_0FB6E8D220A00148">
from a &s;edentary life: nor do I mean to offer the lea&s;t re&s;traint to tho&s;e manufactories among men, which ad|mit of free air, and the exerci&s;e of all their limbs. Perhaps the ab&s;traction of &s;pirituous liquors, and a pure air, might render &s;edentary employments le&s;s un|healthy in America even among men, than in the po|pulous towns of Great-Britain.</P>
<P>THE population of a country is not to be accom|pli&s;hed by rewards and puni&s;hments. And it is happy for America, that the univer&s;al prevalence of the pro|te&s;tant religion, the checks lately given to negro &s;la|very, the general unwillingne&s;s among us to acknow|ledge the u&s;urpations of primogeniture, the univer&s;al practice of inoculation for the &s;mall-pox, and the ab|&s;ence of the plague, render the interpo&s;ition of govern|ment for that purpo&s;e unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>THESE advantages can only be &s;ecured to our coun|try by AGRICULTURE. This is the true ba&s;is of na|tional health, riches and populou&s;ne&s;s. Nations, like individuals, never ri&s;e higher than when they are ig|norant whither they are tending. It is impo&s;&s;ible to tell from hi&s;tory, what will be the effects of agricul|ture, indu&s;try, temperance and commerce, urged on by the competition of colonies, united in the &s;ame ge|neral pur&s;uits, in a country, which for extent, variety of &s;oil, climate, and number of navigable rivers, has never been equalled in any quarter of the globe. A|merica is the theatre where human nature will proba|bly receive her la&s;t and principal literary, civil and mi|litary honors.</P>
<P>BUT I recall my&s;elf from the ages of futurity. The province of Penn&s;ylvania has already &s;hewn to her &s;i&s;ter
<PB N="55" REF="022123_0052_0FB6E8D6572EA970">
colonies, the influence of agriculture and commerce upon the number and happine&s;s of a people. It is &s;carcely an hundred years &s;ince our illu&s;trious legi&s;la|tor, with an handful of men, landed upon the&s;e &s;hores. Although the perfection of our government, the healthi|ne&s;s of our climate, and the fertility of our &s;oil, &s;eem|ed to en&s;ure a rapid &s;ettlement of the province; yet it would have required a pre&s;cience bordering upon di|vine, to have foretold, that in &s;uch a &s;hort &s;pace of time, the province would contain above 300,000 inha|bitants; and that near 30,000 of this number &s;hould compo&s;e a city, which &s;hould be the third, if not the &s;econd in commerce in the Briti&s;h empire. The pur|&s;uits of literature, require lei&s;ure and a total rece&s;s from clearing fore&s;ts, planting, building, and all the com|mon toils of &s;ettling a new country: But before the&s;e arduous works were accompli&s;hed, the SCIENCES, ever fond of the company of liberty and indu&s;try, cho&s;e this &s;pot for the &s;eat of their empire in this new world. Our COLLEGE, &s;o catholic in its foundation, and ex|ten&s;ive in its objects, already &s;ees her &s;ons executing offices in the highe&s;t departments of &s;ociety. I have now the honor of &s;peaking in the pre&s;ence of a mo&s;t re&s;pectable number of philo&s;ophers, phy&s;icians, a&s;tro|nomers, botani&s;ts, patriots, and legi&s;lators; many of whom have already &s;eized the prizes of honor, which their ance&s;tors had allotted to a much later po&s;terity. Our fir&s;t offering had &s;carcely found its way into the temple of &s;ame, when the olde&s;t &s;ocieties in Europe turned their eyes upon us, expecting with impatience to &s;ee the mighty fabric of &s;cience, which like a well built arch, can only re&s;t upon the whole of its materi|als, completely fini&s;hed from the trea&s;ures of this un|explored quarter of the globe.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="022123_0053_0FB6E8D80B014E78">
IT reflects equal honor upon our &s;ociety and the honorable a&s;&s;embly of our province, to acknowledge, that we have always found the latter willing to encou|rage by their patronage, and reward by their liberality, all our &s;chemes for promoting u&s;eful knowledge. What may we not expect from this harmony between the &s;cien|ces and government! Methinks I &s;ee canals cut, rivers once impa&s;&s;able, rendered navigable, bridges erected, and roads improved, to facilitate the exportation of grain. I &s;ee the banks of our rivers vying in fruitful|ne&s;s with the banks of the river of Egypt. I behold our farmers, nobles; our merchants, princes. But I forbear&mdash;Imagination cannot &s;well with the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>I BEG leave to conclude, by deriving an argument from our connection with the legi&s;lature, to remind my auditors of the duty they owe to the &s;ociety. Pa|trioti&s;m and literature are here connected together; and a man cannot neglect the one, without being de&s;titute of the other. Nature and our ance&s;tors have comple|ted their works among us; and have left us nothing to do, but to enlarge and perpetuate our own happine&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF THE CLIMATE OF PENNSYLVANIA, AND ITS INFLUENCE UPON THE HUMAN BODY.</HEAD>
<P>IN order to render the ob&s;ervations upon the epide|mic di&s;ea&s;es which compo&s;e a part of this volume more u&s;eful, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to prefix to them a &s;hort account of the climate of Penn&s;ylvania, and its influence upon the human body. This account may perhaps &s;erve further, to lead to future di&s;coveries, and more exten&s;ive ob&s;ervations, upon this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>THE &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania lies between 39&deg; 43&prime; 25&Prime;, and 42&deg; north latitude, including, of cour&s;e, 2&deg; 16&prime; 35&Prime;, equal to 157 miles from its &s;outhern to its northern boundary. The we&s;tern extremity of the &s;tate is in the longitude of 5&deg; 23&prime; 40&Prime;, and the ea&s;tern, in that of 27&prime; from the meridian of Philadelphia, com|prehending in a due we&s;t cour&s;e 311 miles, exclu&s;ive of the territory lately purcha&s;ed by Penn&s;ylvania from the United States, of which as yet no accurate &s;urveys have been obtained. The &s;tate is bounded on the
<PB N="58" REF="022123_0055_0FB6E8DB92046570">
&s;outh by part of the &s;tate of Delaware, by the whole &s;tate of Maryland, and by Virginia to her we&s;tern ex|tremity. The la&s;t named &s;tate, the territory lately ceded to Connecticut, and Lake Erie, (part of which is in|cluded in Penn&s;ylvania) form the we&s;tern and north|we&s;tern boundaries of the &s;tate. Part of New-York and the territory lately ceded to Penn&s;ylvania, with a part of Lake Erie, compo&s;e the northern, and another part of New-York, with a large extent of New-Jer&s;ey (&s;eparated from Penn&s;ylvania by the river Delaware) compo&s;e the ea&s;tern boundaries of the &s;tate. The lands which form the&s;e boundaries (except a part of the &s;tates of Delaware, Maryland, and New-Jer&s;ey) are in a &s;tate of nature. A large tract of the we&s;tern and north-ea&s;tern parts of Penn&s;ylvania are nearly in the &s;ame uncultivated &s;ituation.</P>
<P>THE &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania is inter&s;ected and diver|&s;ified with numerous rivers, and mountains. To de|&s;cribe, or even to name them all, would far exceed the limits I have propo&s;ed to this account of our climate. It will be &s;ufficient only to remark, that one of the&s;e rivers, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the Su&s;quehannah, begins at the northern boundary of the &s;tate twelve miles from the river De|laware, and winding &s;everal hundred miles through a variegated country, enters the &s;tate of Maryland on the &s;outhern line, fifty-eight miles we&s;tward of Philadel|phia; that each of the&s;e rivers is &s;upplied by numerous &s;treams of various &s;izes; that tides flow in parts of two of them, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> in the Delaware and Schuylkill; that the re&s;t ri&s;e and fall alternately in wet and dry weather; and that they de&s;cend with great rapidity, over prominent beds of rocks in many places, until they empty them&s;elves into the bays of Delaware and

Che&s;apeak on the ea&s;t, and into the Ohio on the we&s;t|ern parts of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>THE mountains form a con&s;iderable part of the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania. Many of them appear to be re&s;erved as perpetual marks of the original empire of nature in this country. The Allegany, which cro&s;&s;es the &s;tate about two hundred miles from Philadelphia, in a north inclining to an ea&s;t cour&s;e, is the mo&s;t con&s;iderable and exten&s;ive of the&s;e mountains. It is called by the In|dians the backbone of the continent. Its height in dif|ferent places is &s;uppo&s;ed to be about 1300 feet from the adjacent plains.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The author is happy in being able to inform the public, that a correct view of the&s;e mountains and rivers, with their heights, di&s;tances and cour&s;es, will be publi&s;hed in a few months by Mr. Reading Howell, of the city of Philadelphia, in a large map of Penn&s;ylvania.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE &s;oil of Penn&s;ylvania is diver&s;ified by its vici|nity to mountains and rivers. The vallies and bot|toms con&s;i&s;t of a black mould, which extends from a foot to four feet in depth. But in general a deep clay forms the &s;urface of the earth. Immen&s;e beds of lime|&s;tone lie beneath this clay in many parts of the &s;tate. This account of the &s;oil of Penn&s;ylvania is confined wholly to the lands on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the Allegany mountain. The &s;oil on the we&s;t &s;ide of this mountain &s;hall be de&s;cribed in another place.</P>
<P>THE city of Philadelphia lies in the latitude of 39&deg; 57&prime;, in longitude 75&deg; 8&prime; from Greenwich, and fifty-five miles we&s;t from the Atlantic ocean.</P>
<P>IT is &s;ituated about four miles due north from the conflux of the rivers Delaware and Schuylkill. The buildings, which con&s;i&s;t chiefly of brick, extend near|ly
<PB N="60" REF="022123_0057_0FB6E8E3DC8193B0">
three miles north and &s;outh along the Delaware, and above half a mile due we&s;t towards the Schuylkill, to which river the limits of the city extend; the whole including a di&s;tance of two miles from the Delaware. The land near the rivers, between the city and the con|flux of the rivers, is in general low, moi&s;t, and &s;ub|ject to be overflowed. The greate&s;t part of it is mea|dow ground. The land to the northward and we&s;t|ward, in the vicinity of the city, is high, and in ge|neral well cultivated. Before the year 1778 the ground between the pre&s;ent improvements of the city, and the river Schuylkill, was covered with woods. The&s;e, together with large tracts of wood to the northward of the city, were cut down during the winter the Briti&s;h army had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Philadelphia. I &s;hall hereafter mention the influence which the cutting down of the&s;e woods, and the &s;ub&s;equent cultivation of the grounds in the neighbourhood of the city, have had upon the health of its inhabitants.</P>
<P>THE mean height of the ground on which the city &s;tands, is about forty feet above the river Delaware. One of the longe&s;t and mo&s;t populous &s;treets in the city, ri&s;es only a few feet above the river. The air at the north is much purer than at the &s;outh end of the city; hence the lamps exhibit a fainter flame in its &s;outhern than its northern parts.</P>
<P>THE tide of the Delaware &s;eldom ri&s;es more than &s;ix feet. It flows four miles in an hour. Its width near the city is about a mile.</P>
<P>THE city, with the adjoining di&s;tricts of South-wark and the Northern Liberties, contain between 40 and 50,000 inhabitants.</P>

FROM the accounts which have been handed down to us by our ance&s;tors, there is rea&s;on to believe that the climate of Penn&s;ylvania has undergone a material change. Thunder and lightning are le&s;s frequent, and the cold of our winters and heat of our &s;ummers are le&s;s uniform, than they were forty or fifty years ago. Nor is this all. The &s;prings are much colder, and the autumns more temperate than formerly, in&s;omuch that cattle are not hou&s;ed &s;o &s;oon by one month as they were in former years. Within the la&s;t eight years, there have been &s;ome exceptions to part of the&s;e ob|&s;ervations. The winter of the year 1779, 80, was uniformly and uncommonly cold. The river Dela|ware was frozen near three months during this winter, and public roads for waggons and &s;leighs connected the city of Philadelphia in many places with the Jer|&s;ey &s;hore. The thickne&s;s of the ice in the river near the city, was from &s;ixteen to nineteen inches, and the depth of the fro&s;t in the ground was from four to five feet, according to the expo&s;ure of the ground and the quality of the &s;oil. This extraordinary depth of the fro&s;t in the earth, compared with its depth in more northern and colder countries, is occa&s;ioned by the long delay of &s;now, which leaves the earth without a covering during the la&s;t autumnal and the fir&s;t winter months. Many plants were de&s;troyed by the inten&s;e|ne&s;s of the cold during this winter. The ears of horn|ed cattle and the feet of hogs expo&s;ed to the air, were fro&s;t-bitten; &s;quirrels peri&s;hed in their holes, and par|tridges were often found dead in the neighbourhood of farm-hou&s;es. The mercury in January &s;tood for &s;everal hours at 5&deg; below 0, in Farenheit's thermo|meter; and during the whole of this month, (except on one day) it never ro&s;e in the city of Philadelphia to the freezing point.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="022123_0059_0FB6E8EBC2CBAAF0">
THE cold in the winter of the year 1783, 4, was as inten&s;e but not &s;o &s;teady, as it was in the winter that has been de&s;cribed. It differed from it materially in one particular, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> there was a thaw in the month of January which opened all our rivers for a few days.</P>
<P>THE &s;ummer which &s;ucceeded the winter of 1779, 80, was uniformly warm. The mercury in the ther|mometer, during this &s;ummer, &s;tood on one day (the 15th of Augu&s;t) at 95&deg;, and fluctuated between 93&deg; and 80&deg; for many weeks. The thermometer, in every reference that has been, or &s;hall be made to it, &s;tood in the &s;hade in the open air.</P>
<P>I KNOW it has been &s;aid by many old people, that the winters in Penn&s;ylvania are le&s;s cold, and the &s;ummers le&s;s warm, than they were forty or fifty years ago. The want of thermometrical ob&s;ervations before and during tho&s;e years, renders it difficult to decide this que&s;tion. Perhaps the difference of &s;en&s;ation be|tween youth and old age, with re&s;pect to heat and cold, may have laid the foundation of this opinion. I &s;u&s;|pect the mean temperature of the air in Penn&s;ylvania has not altered, but that the principal change in our climate con&s;i&s;ts in the heat and cold being le&s;s con|fined than formerly to their natural &s;ea&s;ons. I adopt the opinion of Doctor William&s;on<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">American Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions, vol. I.</NOTE> re&s;pecting the di|minution of the cold in the &s;outhern, being occa&s;ioned by the cultivation of the northern parts of Europe; but no &s;uch cultivation has taken place in the coun|tries which lie to the north-we&s;t of Penn&s;ylvania, nor do the partial and imperfect improvements which have been made in the north-we&s;t parts of the &s;tate, ap|pear to be &s;ufficient to le&s;&s;en the cold, even in the
<PB N="63" REF="022123_0060_0FB6E8ECF669CF40">
city of Philadelphia. I have been able to collect no facts, which di&s;po&s;e me to believe that the winters were colder before the year 1740, than they have been &s;ince. In the memorable winter of 1739, 40, the Delaware was cro&s;&s;ed on the ice in &s;leighs on the 5th of March, old &s;tyle, and did not open till the 13th of the &s;ame month. The ground was covered during this winter with a deep &s;now, and the rays of the &s;un were con|&s;tantly ob&s;cured by a mi&s;t, which hung in the upper regions of the air. In the winter of 1779, 80, the river was navigable on the 4th of March; the depth of the &s;now was moderate, and the gloomine&s;s of the cold was &s;ometimes &s;u&s;pended for a few days by a cheerful &s;un. From the&s;e facts, it is probable the winter of 1739, 40, was colder than the winter of 1779, 80.</P>
<P>HAVING premi&s;ed the&s;e general remarks, I pro|ceed to ob&s;erve, that there are &s;eldom more than twen|ty or thirty days in &s;ummer or winter in Penn&s;ylvania in which the mercury ri&s;es above 80&deg; in the former, or falls below 30&deg; in the latter &s;ea&s;on. Some old peo|ple have remarked that the number of <HI>extremely</HI> cold and warm days in &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;ummers and winters, bears an exact proportion to each other. This was &s;trictly true in the years 1787 and 1788.</P>
<P>THE warme&s;t part of the day in &s;ummer is at two, in ordinary, and at three o'clock in the afternoon in extremely warm weather. From the&s;e hours the heat gradually dimini&s;hes till the en&s;uing morning. The coole&s;t part of the four and twenty hours is at the break of day. There are &s;eldom more than three or four nights in a &s;ummer, in which the heat of the air is nearly the &s;ame as in the preceding day. After the
<PB N="64" REF="022123_0061_0FB6E8EF2B081148">
warme&s;t days, the evenings are generally agreeable, and often delightful. The higher the mercury ri&s;es in the day time, the lower it falls the &s;ucceeding night. The mercury at 80&deg; generally falls to 68&deg;, while it de&s;cends, when at 60&deg; only to 56&deg;. This di&s;proportion be|tween the temperature of the day and night, in &s;um|mer, is always greate&s;t in the month of Augu&s;t. The dews at this time are heavy in proportion to the cool|ne&s;s of the evening. They are &s;ometimes &s;o con&s;ider|able as to wet the cloaths; and there are in&s;tances in which mar&s;h-meadows, and even creeks which have been dry during the &s;ummer, have been &s;upplied with their u&s;ual waters from no other &s;ource than the dews which have fallen in this month, or in the fir&s;t weeks of September.</P>
<P>THERE is another circum&s;tance connected with the one ju&s;t mentioned, which contributes very much to mitigate the heat of &s;ummer, and that is, it &s;eldom continues more than two or three days without being &s;ucceeded with &s;howers of rain, accompanied &s;ome|times by thunder and lightning, and afterwards by a north-we&s;t wind, which produces a coolne&s;s in the air that is highly invigorating and agreeable.</P>
<P>THE warme&s;t weather is <HI>generally</HI> in the month of July. But inten&s;ely warm days are often felt in May, June, Augu&s;t and September. In the annexed table of the weather for the year 1787, there is an exception to the fir&s;t of the&s;e remarks. It &s;hews that the mean heat of Augu&s;t was greater by a few degrees than that of July.</P>
<P>THE tran&s;itions from heat to cold are often very &s;udden, and &s;ometimes to very di&s;tant degrees. After
<PB N="65" REF="022123_0062_0FB6E8F4ABE07F88">
a day in which the mercury has &s;tood at 86&deg; and even 90&deg;, it &s;ometimes falls in the cour&s;e of a &s;ingle night to the 65th, and even to the 60th degree, in&s;omuch that fires have been found nece&s;&s;ary the en&s;uing morning, e&s;pecially if the change in the temperature of the air has been accompanied by rain and a &s;outh-ea&s;t wind. In a &s;ummer month in the year 1775, the mercury was ob&s;erved to fall 20&deg; in an hour and an half. There are few &s;ummers in which fires are not agreeable du|ring &s;ome parts of them. My ingenious friend Mr. David Rittenhou&s;e, who&s;e talent for accurate ob&s;erva|tion extends alike to all &s;ubjects, informed me, that he had never pa&s;&s;ed a &s;ummer, during his re&s;idence in the country, without di&s;covering fro&s;t in every month of the year, except July.</P>
<P>THE weather is equally variable in Penn&s;ylvania du|ring the greate&s;t part of the winter. The mercury fell from 37&deg; to 4&frac12;&deg; below 0, in four and twenty hours, between the fourth and fifth of February 1788. In this &s;ea&s;on nature &s;eems to play at cro&s;s-purpo&s;es. Heavy falls of &s;now are often &s;ucceeded in a few days by a general thaw, which frequently in a &s;hort time leaves no ve&s;tige of the &s;now. The rivers Delaware, Schuylkill and Su&s;quehannah have &s;ometimes been frozen (&s;o as to bear hor&s;es and carriages of all kinds) and thawed &s;o as to be pa&s;&s;able in boats, two or three times in the cour&s;e of the &s;ame winter. The ice is formed for the mo&s;t part in a gradual manner, and &s;eldom till it has been previou&s;ly chilled by a fall of &s;now. Sometimes its production is more &s;udden. On the 31&s;t of December 1764, the Delaware was com|pletely frozen over between ten o'clock at night and eight the next morning, &s;o as to bear the weight of a man. An unu&s;ual vapor like a fog was &s;een to ri&s;e
<PB N="66" REF="022123_0063_0FB6E8F78711E7F0">
from the water, in its pa&s;&s;age from a fluid to a &s;olid &s;tate.</P>
<P>THIS account of the variablene&s;s of the weather in winter, does not apply to every part of Penn&s;ylvania. There is a line, about the 41&deg; of the &s;tate, beyond which the winters are &s;teady and regular, in&s;omuch that the earth there is &s;eldom without a covering of &s;now during the three winter months. In this line the cli|mate of Penn&s;ylvania forms a union with the climate of the ea&s;tern and northern &s;tates.</P>
<P>THE time in which fro&s;t and ice begin to &s;hew them&s;elves in the neighbourhood of Philadelphia, is generally about the latter end of October or the be|ginning of November. But the inten&s;e cold &s;eldom &s;ets in till about the 20th or 25th of December; hence the common &s;aying, <Q>as the day lengthens the cold &s;trengthens.</Q> The colde&s;t weather is commonly in January. The navigation of the river Delaware, after being frozen, is &s;eldom practicable for large ve&s;&s;els, before the fir&s;t week in March.</P>
<P>As in &s;ummer there are often days in which fires are agreeable, &s;o there are &s;ometimes days in winter in which they are di&s;agreeable. Vegetation has been ob&s;erved in all the winter months. Garlic was ta&s;ted in butter in January 1781. The leaves of the wil|low, the blo&s;&s;oms of the peach tree, and the flowers of the dandelion and the crocus, were all &s;een in Fe|bruary 1779; and I well recollect, about thirty-two years ago, to have &s;een an apple-orchard in full bloom, and &s;mall apples on many of the trees, in the month of December.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="022123_0064_0FB6E8F9CB69C4A8">
A COLD day in winter is often &s;ucceeded by a mo|derate evening. The colde&s;t part of the four and twenty hours is generally at the break of day.</P>
<P>IN the mo&s;t inten&s;e cold which has been recorded in Philadelphia, within the la&s;t twenty years, the mer|cury &s;tood at 5&deg; below 0. But it appears from the accounts publi&s;hed by Me&s;&s;ieurs Ma&s;on and Dixon, in the 58th volume of the tran&s;actions of the Royal So|ciety of London, that the mercury &s;tood at 22&deg; be|low 0 on the 2d of January 1767, at Brandywine, about thirty miles to the we&s;tward of Philadelphia. They inform us, that on the fir&s;t of the &s;ame month the mercury &s;tood at 20&deg;, and on the day before at 7&deg; below 0. I have to lament that I am not able to procure any record of the temperature of the air in the &s;ame year in Philadelphia. From the variety in the height and quality of the &s;oil, and from the difference in the currents of winds and the quantity of rain and &s;now which fall in different parts of the &s;tate, it is very probable this exce&s;&s;ive cold may not have extended thirty miles from the place where it was perceived.</P>
<P>THE greate&s;t degree of heat upon record in Phila|delphia, is 95&deg;.</P>
<P>THE &s;tandard temperature of the air in the city of Philadelphia is 52&frac12;&deg;, which is the temperature of our deepe&s;t wells, as al&s;o the mean heat of our common &s;pring water.</P>
<P>THE &s;pring in Penn&s;ylvania is generally le&s;s plea|&s;ant, than in many other countries. In March the weather is &s;tormy, variable and cold. In April, and
<PB N="68" REF="022123_0065_0FB6E8FB38E552A8">
&s;ometimes in the beginning of May, it is moi&s;t, and ac|companied by a degree of cold which has been called <HI>rawne&s;s,</HI> and which from its di&s;agreeable effects upon the temper has been called the <HI>&s;irocco</HI> of this country. From the variable nature of the weather in the &s;pring, vegetation advances very differently in different years. The colder the &s;pring, the more favourable it proves to the fruits of the earth. The hopes of the farmer from his fruit-trees in a warm &s;pring are often bla&s;t|ed by a fro&s;t in April and May. A fall of &s;now is remembered with regret by many of them on the night between the third and fourth of May in the year 1774. The colder the winter, the greater delay we ob&s;erve in the return of the en&s;uing &s;pring.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES the weather during the &s;pring months is cloudy and damp, attended occa&s;ionally with a gentle fall of rain re&s;embling the &s;pray from a cataract of water. A day of this &s;pecies of weather is called, from its re&s;em|blance to a damp day in Great-Britain, "an Engli&s;h day." This damp weather &s;eldom continues more than three or four days. The month of May 1786, will long be remembered, for having furni&s;hed a very un|common in&s;tance of the ab&s;ence of the &s;un for fourteen days, and of con&s;tant damp or rainy weather.</P>
<P>THE month of June is the only month in the year which re&s;embles a &s;pring month in the &s;outhern coun|tries of Europe. The weather is then generally tem|perate, the &s;ky is &s;erene, and the verdure of the coun|try is univer&s;al and delightful.</P>
<P>THE autumn is the mo&s;t agreeable &s;ea&s;on in the year in Penn&s;ylvania. The cool evenings and mornings, which generally begin about the fir&s;t week in Septem|ber,
<PB N="69" REF="022123_0066_0FB6E8FC9420D500">
are &s;ucceeded by a moderate temperature of the air during the day. This &s;pecies of weather continues with an increa&s;e of cold &s;carcely perceptible, till the middle of October, when the autumm is clo&s;ed by rain, which &s;ometimes falls in &s;uch quantities as to produce de&s;tructive fre&s;hes in the rivers and creeks, and &s;ome|times de&s;cends in gentle &s;howers, which continue with occa&s;ional interruptions by a few fair days, for two or three weeks. The&s;e rains are the harbingers of the winter, and the Indians have long ago taught the in|habitants of Penn&s;ylvania, that the degrees of cold du|ring the winter, are in proportion to the quantity of rain which falls during the autumn<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>I cannot help agreeing with Mr. Kirwan in one of his remarks upon the &s;cience of meteorology in the preface to his e&s;timate of the temperature of different latitudes. "This &s;cience (&s;ays he) if brought to perfection, would enable us at lea&s;t to fore&s;ee tho&s;e changes in the weather which we could not prevent. Great as is the di&s;tance between &s;uch knowledge, and our own pre&s;ent attainments, we have no rea&s;on to think it above the level of the pow|ers of the human mind. The motions of the planets mu&s;t have appeared as perplexed and intricate to tho&s;e who fir&s;t contemplated them; yet by per&s;e|vering indu&s;try, they are now known to the utmo&s;t preci&s;ion. The pre&s;ent is (as the great Leibnitz expre&s;&s;es it) in every ca&s;e pregnant with the future, and the connection mu&s;t be found by long and attentive ob&s;ervation."</P>
<P>The influence which the perfection of this &s;cience mu&s;t have upon health, agriculture, navigation and commerce, is too obvious to be mentioned.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>FROM this account of the temperature of the air in Penn&s;ylvania, it is evident that there are &s;eldom more than four months in which the weather is agreeable without a fire.</P>
<P>IN winter, the winds generally come from the north-we&s;t in <HI>fair,</HI> and from the north-ea&s;t in <HI>wet</HI> weather. The north-we&s;t winds are uncommonly dry as well as cold. It is in con&s;equence of the violent action of the&s;e winds that trees have uniformly a thicker and more compact bark on their northern, than on their &s;outhern expo&s;ures. Even brick hou&s;es are affected
<PB N="70" REF="022123_0067_0FB6E8FE5368E710">
by the force and dryne&s;s of the&s;e north-we&s;t winds: hence it is much more difficult to demoli&s;h the north|ern than the &s;outhern walls of an old brick hou&s;e. This fact was communicated to me by an eminent bricklayer in the city of Philadelphia.</P>
<P>THE winds in fair weather in the &s;pring, and in warm weather in the &s;ummer, blow from the &s;outh-we&s;t and from we&s;t-north-we&s;t. The <HI>raw</HI> air before mentioned, comes from the north-ea&s;t. The &s;outh-we&s;t winds likewi&s;e u&s;ually bring with them tho&s;e &s;how|ers of rain in the &s;pring and &s;ummer, which refre&s;h the earth. They moreover moderate the heat of the weather, provided they are &s;ucceeded by a north-we&s;t wind. Now and then &s;howers of rain come from the we&s;t-north-we&s;t.</P>
<P>THERE is a common fact connected with the ac|count of the u&s;ual winds in Penn&s;ylvania, which it may not be improper to mention in this place. While the clouds are &s;een flying from the &s;outh-we&s;t, the <HI>&s;cud,</HI> as it is called, or a light vapor, is &s;een at the &s;ame time flying below the clouds from the north-ea&s;t.</P>
<P>THE moi&s;ture of the air is much greater than for|merly, occa&s;ioned probably by the exhalations which in former years fell in the form of &s;now, now de&s;cend|ing in the form of rain. The depth of the &s;now is &s;ometimes between two and three feet, but in general it &s;eldom exceeds between &s;ix and nine inches.</P>
<P>HAIL frequently de&s;cends with &s;now in winter. Once in four or five years large and heavy &s;howers of hail fall in the &s;pring and &s;ummer. They generally run in narrow veins (as they are called) of thirty or
<PB N="71" REF="022123_0068_0FB6E908D1A38C78">
forty miles in length, and two or three miles in breadth. The heavie&s;t &s;hower of hail that is remembered in Phi|ladelphia, did not extend in breadth more than half a mile north and &s;outh. Some of the &s;tones weighed half an ounce. The windows of many hou&s;es were broken by them. This &s;hower fell in May 1783.</P>
<P>FROM &s;udden changes in the air, rain and &s;now often fall together, forming what is commonly called <HI>&s;leet.</HI></P>
<P>IN the uncultivated parts of the &s;tate, the &s;now &s;ometimes lies on the ground till the fir&s;t week in April. The backwardne&s;s of the &s;pring has been a&s;crib|ed to the pa&s;&s;age of the air over the undi&s;&s;olved beds of &s;now and ice which u&s;ually remain, after the winter months are pa&s;t, on the north-we&s;t grounds and wa|ters of the &s;tate, and of the adjacent country.</P>
<P>THE di&s;&s;olution of the ice and &s;now in the &s;pring, is &s;ometimes &s;o &s;udden as to &s;well the creeks and ri|vers in every part of the &s;tate to &s;uch a degree, as not only to lay wa&s;te the hopes of the hu&s;bandman from the produce of his lands, but in &s;ome in&s;tances to &s;weep his barns, &s;tables, and even his dwelling hou&s;e into their currents<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The following account of the thaw of the river Su&s;quehannah, in the &s;pring of 1784, was publi&s;hed by the author in the Columbian Magazine for November 1786. It may &s;erve to illu&s;trate a fact related formerly in the hi&s;tory of the winters in Penn&s;ylvania, as well as to exhibit an extraordinary in&s;tance of the de&s;tructive effects of a &s;udden thaw.</P>
<P>"THE winter of 1783, 4, was uncommonly cold, in&s;omuch that the mercury in Farenheit's thermometer &s;tood &s;everal times at <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> degrees below 0. The &s;nows were frequent; and, in many places, from two to three feet deep, during the greate&s;t part of the winter. All the rivers in Penn&s;ylvania were frozen, &s;o as to bear waggons and &s;leds with immen&s;e weight. In the month of January a thaw came on &s;uddenly, which opened our rivers &s;o as to &s;et the ice a-driving, to u&s;e the phra&s;e of the country. In the cour&s;e of one night, during the thaw, the wind &s;hifted &s;uddenly to the north-we&s;t, and the weather became inten&s;ely cold. The ice, which had floated the day before, was &s;uddenly ob&s;tructed; and in the river Su&s;quehannah, the ob&s;tructions were formed in tho&s;e places where the water was mo&s;t &s;hallow, or where it had been accu&s;tomed to fall. This river is &s;everal hundred miles in length, and from half a mile to a mile and an half in breadth, and winds through a hilly, and in many places a fertile and highly cultivated country. It has as yet a mo&s;t difficult communication with our bays and the &s;ea, occa&s;ioned by the number and height of the falls which occur near the mouth of the river. The ice in many places, e&s;pecially where there were falls, formed a kind of dam, of a mo&s;t &s;tupendous height. About the middle of March our weather moderated, and a thaw became general. The effects of it were remarkable in all our rivers; but in none &s;o much as in the river I have mentioned. I &s;hall therefore endeavour in a few words to de&s;cribe them. Unfortunately the dams of ice did not give way all at once, nor tho&s;e which lay neare&s;t to the mouth of the river, fir&s;t. While the upper dams were &s;et a-float by the warm weather, the lower ones, which were the large&s;t, and in which, of cour&s;e, the ice was mo&s;t impacted, remained fixed. In con&s;equence of this, the river ro&s;e in a few hours, in many places, above 30 feet; rolling upon its &s;urface large lumps of ice, from 10 to 40 cubic feet in &s;ize. The effects of this &s;udden inundation were terrible. Whole farms were laid under water. Barns&mdash;&s;tables&mdash;hor&s;es&mdash;cattle&mdash;fences&mdash;mills of every kind, and in one in&s;tance, a large &s;tone hou&s;e, 40 by 30 feet, were carried down the &s;tream. Large trees were torn up by the roots&mdash;&s;everal &s;mall i&s;lands covered with woods, were &s;wept away, and not a ve&s;tige of them was left behind. On the barns which pre&s;erved their &s;hape, in &s;ome in&s;tances, for many miles were to be &s;een living fowls; and, in one dwelling, a candle was &s;een to burn for &s;ome time, after it was &s;wept from its foundation. Where the &s;hore was level, the lumps of ice, and the ruins of hou&s;es and farms, were thrown a quarter of a mile from the ordinary height of the river. In &s;ome in&s;tances, farms were ruined by the mould being &s;wept from them by the cakes of ice, or by depo&s;itions of &s;and; while others were enriched by large depo&s;itions of mud. The damage, upon the whole, done to the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania by this fre&s;h, was very great. In mo&s;t places it happened in the day time, or the con&s;equences mu&s;t have been fatal to many thou&s;ands.</P>
<P>"I know of but one u&s;e that can be derived from recording the hi&s;tory of this inundation. In ca&s;e of &s;imiliar ob&s;tructions of rivers, from cau&s;es &s;uch as have been de&s;cribed, the terrible effects of their being &s;et in motion by means of a general thaw, may in part be obviated, by removing &s;uch things out of the cour&s;e of the water and ice, as are within our power; particularly cattle, hay, grain, fences, and farming uten&s;ils of all kinds."</P></NOTE>. The wind during a general thaw, comes from the &s;outh-we&s;t or &s;outh-ea&s;t.</P>

THE air, when dry in Penn&s;ylvania, has a peculiar ela&s;ticity, which renders the heat and cold le&s;s in&s;up|portable than the &s;ame degrees of both are in moi&s;ter countries. It is in tho&s;e ca&s;es only when &s;ummer &s;howers are not &s;ucceeded by north-we&s;t winds, that the heat of the air becomes oppre&s;&s;ive and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, from being combined with moi&s;ture.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="022123_0070_0FB6E90BA2FE7730">
FROM tradition, as well as living ob&s;ervation, it is evident, that the waters in many of the creeks in Penn&s;ylvania have dimini&s;hed con&s;iderably within the la&s;t fifty years. Hence many mills, erected upon large and deep &s;treams of water, now &s;tand idle in dry wea|ther; and many creeks, once navigable in large boats, are now impa&s;&s;able, even in canoes. This diminution of the waters has been a&s;cribed to the application of a part of them to the purpo&s;e of making meadows.</P>
<P>THE mean elevation of the barometer in Philadel|phia, is about 30 inches. The variations in the baro|meter are very incon&s;iderable in the greate&s;t changes of the weather, which occur in the city of Philadelphia. During the violent and de&s;tructive &s;torm which blew from the &s;outh-we&s;t on the 11th of November 1788, it &s;uddenly fell from 30 to 29 3/10. Mr. Rittenhou&s;e in|forms me, that long and faithful ob&s;ervations have &s;atisfied him, that the alterations in the height of the mercury in the barometer do not <HI>precede</HI> but always <HI>&s;ucceed</HI> changes in the weather. It falls with the &s;outh and &s;outh-we&s;t, and ri&s;es with the north and north-we&s;t winds.</P>
<P>THE quantity of water which falls in rain and &s;now, one year with another, amounts to from 24 to 36 inches. But to complete the account of variable qualities in the climate, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to add, that our &s;ummers and autumns are &s;ometimes marked by a <HI>deficiency,</HI> or by an <HI>exce&s;&s;ive</HI> quantity of rain. The &s;ummer and au|tumn of 1782 were uncommonly dry, Near two months elap&s;ed without a &s;ingle &s;hower of rain. There were only two &s;howers in the whole months of Septem|ber and October. In con&s;equence of this dry wea|ther, there was no &s;econd crop of hay. The Indian

corn failed of its increa&s;e in many places, and was cut down for food for cattle. Trees newly planted, died. The pa&s;ture fields not only lo&s;t their verdure, but threw up &s;mall clouds of du&s;t when agitated by the feet of men, or bea&s;ts. Cattle in &s;ome in&s;tances were driven many miles to be watered, every morning and evening<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was remarked during this dry weather, that the &s;heep were uncom|monly fat, and their fle&s;h well ta&s;ted, while all the other dome&s;tic animals langui&s;hed from the want of gra&s;s and water.</NOTE>. The earth became &s;o inflammable in &s;ome places, as to burn above a foot below its &s;urface.

Crabs which never for&s;ake &s;alt or bracki&s;h water, were caught more than a mile above the city of Philadelphia, in the river Delaware, which is 60 miles above the places in which they are u&s;ually found.

THE &s;ummer of the year 1788 afforded a remark|able in&s;tance of <HI>exce&s;s</HI> in the quantity of rain, which &s;ometimes falls in Penn&s;ylvania. Thirteen days are marked with rain in July in the records of the weather kept at Spring-Mill. There fell on the 18th and 19th of Augu&s;t &s;even inches of rain in the city of Philadelphia. The wheat &s;uffered greatly by the con&s;tant rains of July in the ea&s;tern and middle parts of the &s;tate. So un|productive a harve&s;t in grain, from wet weather, had not been known, it is &s;aid, in the cour&s;e of the la&s;t 70 years. The heat of the air during the&s;e &s;ummer months was very moderate. Its mean temperature at Spring-Mill was 67, 8 in June, 74, 7 in July, and only 70, 6 in Augu&s;t.</P>
<P>IT is &s;ome con&s;olation to a citizen of Penn&s;ylvania, in recording facts which &s;eem to militate again&s;t our climate, to reflect, that the difference of the weather in different parts of the &s;tate at the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on, is hap|pily accommodated to promote an increa&s;e of the &s;ame objects of agriculture; and hence a deficiency of crops has never been known in any one year throughout the <HI>whole</HI> &s;tate.</P>
<P>THE aurora borealis and meteors are &s;een occa&s;ion|ally in Penn&s;ylvania. In the pre&s;ent imperfect &s;tate of our knowledge of their influence upon the human body, it will be foreign to the de&s;ign of this hi&s;tory of our climate to de&s;cribe them.</P>
<P>STORMS and hurricanes are not unknown in Penn|&s;ylvania. They occur once in four or five years, but they are mo&s;t frequent and de&s;tructive in the autumn. They are generally accompanied by rain. Trees are torn up by the roots, and the rivers and creeks are

&s;ometimes &s;welled &s;o &s;uddenly as to do con&s;iderable damage to the adjoining farms. The wind, during the&s;e &s;torms, generally blows from the &s;outh-ea&s;t and &s;outh-we&s;t. In the &s;torms which occurred in Septem|ber 1769, and in the &s;ame month of the year 1785, the wind veered round contrary to its u&s;ual cour&s;e, and blew from the north.</P>
<P>AFTER what has been &s;aid, the character of the climate of Penn&s;ylvania may be &s;ummed up in a few words. There are no two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive years alike. Even the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;ea&s;ons and months differ from each other every year. Perhaps there is but one &s;teady trait in the character of our climate, and that is, it is uniform|ly variable.</P>

IT is worthy of notice, how near the mean heat of the year, and of the month of April, in two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive years, are to each other in the &s;ame place. The mean heat of April 1787 was 54&deg; 3, that of April 1788 was 52&deg; 2. By the table of the mean heat of each month in the year, it appears that the mean heat of 1787 was 53&deg; 5 at Spring-Mill.</P>
<P>THE following accounts of the climates of Pekin and Madrid, which lie within a few minutes of the &s;ame latitude as Philadelphia, may &s;erve to &s;hew how much climates are altered by local and relative circum&s;tances. The account of the temperature of the air at Pekin, will &s;erve further to &s;hew, that with all the advanta|ges of the highe&s;t degrees of cultivation which have taken place in China, the winters are colder, and the &s;ummers warmer there than in Penn&s;ylvania, princi|pally from a cau&s;e which will probably operate upon the winters of Penn&s;ylvania for many centuries to come, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the vicinity of an uncultivated north-we&s;t country.</P>

the North Pacific, which is here 4 or 5 degrees colder than the Atlantic. The Yellow Sea is the neare&s;t to Pekin, being about 200 miles di&s;tant from it; but it is it&s;elf cooled by the mountainous country of Co|rea, which interpo&s;es between it and the ocean, for a con&s;iderable part of its extent.

<P>THE above accounts are extracted from Mr. Kir|wan's u&s;eful and elaborate e&s;timate of the temperature of different latitudes.</P>
<P>THE hi&s;tory which has been given of the climate of Penn&s;ylvania, is confined chiefly to the country on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the Allegany mountain. On the we&s;t &s;ide of this mountain, the climate differs materially from that of the &s;outh-ea&s;tern parts of the &s;tate in the tem|perature of the air, in the effects of the winds upon the
<PB N="80" REF="022123_0077_0FB6E922E7D2E688">
and in the quantity of rain and &s;now, which falls every year. The winter &s;eldom breaks up on the mountains before the 25th of March. A fall of &s;now was once perceived upon it, which mea&s;ured an inch and an half on the 11th day of June. The trees which grow upon it are &s;mall, and Indian corn is with difficulty brought to maturity even at the foot of the ea&s;t &s;ide of it. The &s;outh-we&s;t winds on the we&s;t &s;ide of the mountain are accompanied by cold and rain. The &s;oil is rich, con&s;i&s;ting of near a foot in many places of black mould. The roads in this country are muddy in winter, but &s;eldom du&s;ty in &s;ummer. The arrange|ment of the &s;trata of the earth on the we&s;t &s;ide, differs materially from their arrangement on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the mountain. <Q>The country, (&s;ays Mr. Rittenhou&s;e in a letter to a friend in Philadelphia<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Columbian Magazine for October 1786.</NOTE>) when viewed from the we&s;tern ridge of the Allegany, appears to be one va&s;t, extended plain. All the various &s;trata of &s;tone &s;eem to lie undi&s;turbed in the &s;ituation in which they were fir&s;t formed, and the layers of &s;tone, &s;and, clay, and coal, are nearly <HI>horizontal.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THE temperature of the air on the we&s;t is &s;eldom &s;o hot, or &s;o cold, as on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the mountain. By comparing the &s;tate of a thermometer examined by Doctor Bedford at Pitt&s;burgh, 284 miles from Philadel|phia, it appears that the weather was not &s;o cold by twelve degrees in that town, as it was in Philadelphia, on the 5th of February 1788.</P>
<P>TO &s;hew the difference between the weather at Spring-Mill and in Pitt&s;burgh, I &s;hall here &s;ubjoin an account of it, in both places, the fir&s;t taken by Mr. Legeaux, and the other by Doctor Bedford. This account is un|fortunately

confined only to the fir&s;t fifteen days in April 1788; but it affords a good &s;pecimen of the dif|ference of the weather, on the two &s;ides of the moun|tain, in every month of the year. It is remarkable that in five days out of &s;even, the rain which fell, was on the <HI>&s;ame</HI> days in both places.</P>

FROM a review of all the facts which have been mentioned, it appears that the climate of Penn&s;ylvania is a compound of mo&s;t of the climates in the world. Here we have the moi&s;ture of Britain in the &s;pring, the heat of Africa in &s;ummer, the temperature of Italy in June, the &s;ky of Egypt in the autumn, the cold and &s;nows of Norway, and the ice of Holland in the winter, the tempe&s;ts (in a certain degree) of the We&s;t-Indies in every &s;ea&s;on, and the variable winds and weather of Great-Britain in every month of the year.</P>
<P>FROM this hi&s;tory of the climate of Penn&s;ylvania, it is ea&s;y to a&s;certain what degrees of health, and what di&s;|ea&s;es prevail in the &s;tate. As we have the climates, &s;o we have the health, and the acute di&s;ea&s;es, of all the coun|tries that have been mentioned. Without attempting to enumerate the di&s;ea&s;es, I &s;hall only add a few words upon the <HI>time</HI> and <HI>manner</HI> in which they are produced.</P>
<P>I. IT appears from the te&s;timonies of many aged per&s;ons, that pleuri&s;ies and inflammatory di&s;orders of all kinds, are le&s;s frequent now than they were forty and fifty years ago.</P>
<P>II. IT is a well known fact, that intermitting and bilious fevers have increa&s;ed in Penn&s;ylvania in pro|portion as the country has been <HI>cleared of its wood,</HI> in many parts of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>III. IT is equally certain that the&s;e fevers have le&s;|&s;ened, or di&s;appeared, in proportion as the country has been <HI>cultivated.</HI></P>
<P>IV. HEAVY rains and fre&s;hes in the &s;pring &s;eldom produce fevers, unle&s;s they are &s;ucceeded by un&s;ea&s;on|ably warm weather.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="022123_0081_0FB6E93422644E58">
V. HEAVY rains, or fro&s;t, in the autumn, alike check the progre&s;s of fevers in Penn&s;ylvania.</P>
<P>VI. THE &s;ame &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere, whether cold or warm, moi&s;t or dry, continued for a long time without any material changes, is always healthy. Acute and inflammatory fevers were in vain looked for in the cold winter of 1779, 80. The dry &s;ummer of 1782, and the wet &s;ummer of 1788, were likewi&s;e un|commonly healthy in the city of Philadelphia. The&s;e facts extend only to tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es which depend upon the &s;en&s;ible qualities of the air. Di&s;ea&s;es from mi|a&s;mata and contagion, are le&s;s influenced by the uni|formity of the weather. The autumn of 1780 was very &s;ickly in Philadelphia, from the peculiar &s;ituati|on of the grounds in the neighbourhood of the city, while the country was uncommonly healthy. The dry &s;ummer and autumn of 1782 were uncommonly &s;ickly in the country, from the exten&s;ive &s;ources of morbid exhalations which were left by the diminution of the waters in the creeks and rivers. The city of Philadel|phia owed its peculiar healthine&s;s during the&s;e two &s;ea|&s;ons, to its being nearly &s;urrounded by tide water.</P>
<P>VII. DISEASES are often <HI>generated</HI> in one &s;ea&s;on and <HI>produced</HI> in another. Hence we frequently ob&s;erve fevers of different kinds to <HI>follow</HI> every &s;pecies of the weather that was mentioned in the la&s;t ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>VIII. THE fevers which accompany, or follow a warm &s;ummer, are bilious and remitting. In propor|tion as the cool weather advances, they put on the type of Doctor Cullen's typhus mitior. After a very cold winter, I have twice &s;een pleuri&s;ies in the &s;pring, accompanied by the &s;ymptoms of the bilious fever. In
<PB N="85" REF="022123_0082_0FB6E935990889F0">
one of tho&s;e epidemics, the pul&s;e, on the fifth day, in &s;everal ca&s;es, became irregular, and &s;topped after every third or fourth &s;troke. This complication of typhus with &s;ynocha, is not peculiar to Penn&s;ylvania. I have been informed that fevers of even a putrid kind frequently &s;ucceed long and cold winters in Ru&s;&s;ia and Sweden. They have been a&s;cribed, by a Ru&s;&s;ian phy|&s;ician, to extreme cold producing the &s;ame &s;edative effects as extreme heat upon the human body.</P>
<P>IX. THE exce&s;&s;ive heat in Penn&s;ylvania has &s;ome|times proved fatal to per&s;ons who have been much ex|po&s;ed to it. Its morbid effects di&s;cover them&s;elves by a difficulty of breathing, a general langour, and in &s;ome in&s;tances, by a numbne&s;s and an immobility of the extremities. The exce&s;&s;ive cold in Penn&s;ylvania has more frequently proved fatal, but it has been chief|ly to tho&s;e per&s;ons who have &s;ought a defence from it, by large draughts of &s;pirituous liquors. Its operation in bringing on &s;leepine&s;s previous to death, is well known. On the 5th of February 1788, many people were af|fected by the cold. It produced a pain in the head; and in one in&s;tance, a &s;ickne&s;s at the &s;tomach, and a vomiting appeared to be the con&s;equence of it. I have frequently ob&s;erved that a greater number of old peo|ple die, during the continuance of extreme cold, and warm weather, than in the &s;ame number of days, in moderate weather.</P>
<P>X. MAY and June are u&s;ually the healthie&s;t months in the year.</P>
<P>XI. THE influence of the winds upon health, depends very much upon the nature of the country over which they pa&s;s. Winds which pa&s;s over mill-dams and mar&s;hes in Augu&s;t and September, generally carry with them the &s;eeds of fevers.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="022123_0083_0FB6E93C5775A168">
XII. THE country in the neighbourhood of Phila|delphia is much more &s;ickly than the central parts of the city, after the 20th of Augu&s;t.</P>
<P>XIII. THE night-air is always unwhole&s;ome from the 20th of Augu&s;t, e&s;pecially during the pa&s;&s;ive &s;tate of the &s;y&s;tem in <HI>&s;leep.</HI> The frequent and &s;udden changes of the air from heat to cold, (exclu&s;ive of its in&s;en&s;ible qualities) render it un&s;afe at any time to &s;leep with open windows.</P>
<P>XIV. PHILADELPHIA became unu&s;ually &s;ickly after the year 1778, during the late war, in con&s;equence of the meadows being overflowed to the &s;outhward of the city, and of the cutting down of the trees by the Briti&s;h army, which formerly &s;heltered the city from the exhalations of the grounds to the north and north-we&s;t. From the repairs of the banks of the meadows, which exclude tides and fre&s;hes; from the cultivation of the grounds to the we&s;tward of the city, which were for|merly covered with filth, or with &s;tagnating waters; and la&s;tly, from the more regular cleaning of the &s;treets, and the enclo&s;ure of a large and offen&s;ive canal which cro&s;&s;ed two of the principal &s;treets near the centre of the city, Philadelphia, from having been formerly the mo&s;t &s;ickly, has become one of the healthie&s;t cities in the United States.</P>
<P>XV. VALETUDINARIANS always enjoy the mo&s;t health in Penn&s;ylvania in the &s;ummer and winter months. The &s;pring, in a particular manner, is very unfavourable to them.</P>
<P>I SHALL conclude the account of the influence of the climate of Penn&s;ylvania upon the human body, with the following ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="87" REF="022123_0084_0FB6E9454A4FD0F8">
1. THE &s;en&s;ations of heat and cold are influenced &s;o much by outward circum&s;tances, that we often mi&s;|take the degrees of them, by neglecting to u&s;e &s;uch conveniencies as are calculated to obviate the effects of their exce&s;s. A native of Jamaica often complains le&s;s of the heat, and a native of Canada of the cold, in their re&s;pective countries, than they do under cer|tain circum&s;tances in Penn&s;ylvania. Even a Penn&s;yl|vanian frequently complains le&s;s of the heat in Ja|maica, and of the cold in Canada, than in his native &s;tate. The rea&s;on of this is plain. In countries where heat and cold are inten&s;e and regular, the inhabitants guard them&s;elves by accommodating their hou&s;es and dre&s;&s;es to each of them. The in&s;tability and &s;hort du|ration of exce&s;&s;ive heat and cold in Penn&s;ylvania, have unfortunately led its inhabitants, in many in&s;tances, to neglect adopting cu&s;toms, which are u&s;ed in hot and cold countries to guard again&s;t them. Where hou&s;es are built with a &s;outhern or &s;outh-we&s;tern front expo|&s;ure, and where other accommodations to the climate are ob&s;erved in their con&s;truction, the di&s;agreeable ex|ce&s;&s;es of heat and cold are rendered much le&s;s percep|tible in Penn&s;ylvania. Perhaps the application of the principles of philo&s;ophy and ta&s;te to the con&s;truction of our hou&s;es within the la&s;t thirty or forty years, may be another rea&s;on why &s;ome old people have &s;uppo&s;ed that the degrees of heat and cold are le&s;s in Penn&s;yl|vania than they were in former years.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE number, height, and vegetable producti|ons of the mountains in Penn&s;ylvania, afford a fa|vourable progno&s;is of the future healthine&s;s of the &s;tate. Exclu&s;ive of the beneficial effects of the&s;e moun|tains in producing &s;alutary winds, and gentle rains, they will &s;erve as a perpetual and inexhau&s;tible &s;tore|hou&s;e
<PB N="88" REF="022123_0085_0FB6E9491AFBD258">
of that pure &s;pecies of air, which has of late been proved to con&s;titute the vital part of common air.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE variable nature of the climate of Penn&s;yl|vania does not render it <HI>nece&s;&s;arily</HI> unhealthy. Doc|tor Huxham has taught us, that the healthie&s;t &s;ea&s;ons in Great-Britain have often been accompanied by the mo&s;t variable weather. His words upon this &s;ubject convey a rea&s;on for the fact. <Q>When the con&s;titu|tions of the year are frequently changing, &s;o that by the <HI>contra&s;t,</HI> a &s;ort of <HI>equilibrium</HI> is kept up, and health with it; and that e&s;pecially if per&s;ons are careful to guard them&s;elves well again&s;t the&s;e &s;udden changes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ob&s;ervations on the air and epidemic di&s;ea&s;es, vol. I. p. 5.</NOTE>.</Q> Perhaps no climate or country is un|healthy, where men acquire from experience, or tra|dition, the arts of accommodating them&s;elves to it. The hi&s;tory of all the nations in the world, whether &s;avage, barbarous, or civilized, previous to a mixture of their manners by an intercour&s;e with &s;trangers, &s;eems to favour this opinion. The climate of China appears, in many particulars, to re&s;emble that of Penn|&s;ylvania. The Chine&s;e wear loo&s;e garments of dif|ferent lengths, and increa&s;e or dimini&s;h the number of them, according to the frequent and &s;udden changes of their weather; hence they have very few acute di&s;|ea&s;es among&s;t them. Tho&s;e inhabitants of Penn&s;ylva|nia who have acquired the arts of conforming to the changes and extremes of our weather in dre&s;s, diet, and manners, e&s;cape mo&s;t of tho&s;e acute di&s;ea&s;es which are occa&s;ioned by the &s;en&s;ible qualities of the air; and faithful inquiries and ob&s;ervations have proved, that they attain to as great ages as the &s;ame number of people in any part of the world.</P>

<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF THE Bilious Remitting Fever, AS IT APPEARED IN PHILADELPHIA, IN THE SUMMER AND AUTUMN OF THE YEAR 1780.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE I proceed to de&s;cribe this fever, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to give a &s;hort account of the wea|ther, and of the di&s;ea&s;es which preceded it.</P>
<P>THE &s;pring of 1780 was dry and cool. A catarrh appeared among children between one year and &s;even years of age. It was accompanied by a defluxion from the eyes and no&s;e, and by a cough and dy&s;pnoea, re&s;em|bling, in &s;ome in&s;tances, the cynanche trachealis, and in others, a peripneumony. In &s;ome ca&s;es it was com|plicated with the &s;ymptoms of a bilious remitting, and intermitting fever. The exacerbations of this fever were always attended by dy&s;pnoea and cough. A few patients expectorated blood. Some had &s;wellings be|hind the ears, and others were affected with &s;mall ul|cers in the throat. I met with only one ca&s;e of this fever in which the pul&s;e indicated bleeding. The re&s;t yielded in a few days to emetics, bli&s;ters, and the bark, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the u&s;ual more &s;imple remedies in &s;uch di&s;orders.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="022123_0087_0FB6E9509C008888">
AN intermittent prevailed among adults in the month of May.</P>
<P>JULY and Augu&s;t were uncommonly warm. The mercury &s;tood on the 6th of Augu&s;t at 94 1/2&deg;, on the 15th of the &s;ame month at 95&deg;, and for &s;everal days afterwards at 90&deg;. Many labouring people peri&s;hed during this month by the heat, and by drinking, not only cold water, but cold liquors of &s;everal kinds, while they were under the violent impre&s;&s;ions of the heat.</P>
<P>THE vomiting and purging prevailed univer&s;ally, during the&s;e two warm months, among the children, and with uncommon degrees of mortality. Children from one year to eight and nine years old were like|wi&s;e very generally affected by blotches and little boils, e&s;pecially in their faces. An eruption on the &s;kin, called by the common people the prickly heat, was very common at this time among per&s;ons of all ages. The winds during the&s;e months blew chiefly from the &s;outh, and &s;outh-we&s;t. Of cour&s;e they pa&s;&s;ed over the land which lies between the city, and the conflux of the rivers Delaware and Schuylkill, the peculiar &s;ituation of which, at that time, has been al|ready de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>THE dock, and the &s;treets of Philadelphia, &s;upplied the winds at this &s;ea&s;on, likewi&s;e, with a portion of their unwhole&s;ome exhalations<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The ma&s;quitoes were uncommonly numerous during the autumn. A certain &s;ign &s;ays Dr. Lind) of an unwhole&s;ome atmo&s;phere.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE remitting fever made its fir&s;t appearance in July and Augu&s;t, but its &s;ymptoms were &s;o mild, and
<PB N="91" REF="022123_0088_0FB6E9521428F320">
its extent &s;o confined, that it excited no apprehen&s;ions of its &s;ub&s;equent more general prevalence throughout the city.</P>
<P>ON the 19th of Augu&s;t the air became &s;uddenly very cool. Many hundred people in the city com|plained, the next day, of different degrees of in|di&s;po&s;ition, from a &s;en&s;e of la&s;&s;itude, to a fever of the remitting type. This was the &s;ignal of the epi|demic. The weather continued cool during the re|maining part of the month, and during the whole month of September. From the expo&s;ure of the di&s;|trict of Southwark (which is often di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of the <HI>Hill</HI>) to the &s;outh-we&s;t winds, the fever made its fir&s;t appearance in that appendage of the city. Scarcely a family, and in many families, &s;carcely a member of them, e&s;caped it. From the Hill it gra|dually travelled along the Second-&s;treet from the De|laware, improperly called Front-&s;treet. For a while it was confined to this &s;treet only, after it entered the city, and hence it was called by &s;ome people the <HI>Front-&s;treet fever.</HI> It gradually &s;pread through other parts of the city, but with very different degrees of vio|lence. It prevailed but little in the Northern Liberties. It was &s;carcely known beyond Fourth-&s;treet from the Delaware. Intemperance in eating or drinking, ri|ding in the &s;un or rain, watching, fatigue, or even a fright, but more frequently cold, all &s;erved to excite the &s;eeds of this fever into action, wherever they exi&s;ted.</P>
<P>ALL ages, and both &s;exes were affected by this fever. Seven of the practitioners of phy&s;ic were confined by it nearly at the &s;ame time. The city, du|ring the prevalence of the fever, was filled with an unu&s;ual number of &s;trangers, many of whom, particu|larly
<PB N="92" REF="022123_0089_0FB6E95815C935A0">
of the Friends (who&s;e yearly meeting was held in the month of September) were affected by it.</P>
<P>THIS fever generally came on with rigor, but &s;el|dom with a regular chilly fit, and often without any &s;en&s;ation of cold. In &s;ome per&s;ons it was introduced by a &s;light &s;ore throat, and in others, by a hoar&s;ene&s;s which was mi&s;taken for a common cold. A giddine&s;s in the head was the forerunner of the di&s;ea&s;e in &s;ome people. This giddine&s;s attacked &s;o &s;uddenly, as to produce, in &s;everal in&s;tances, a faintine&s;s, and even &s;ymptoms of apoplexy. It was remarkable that all tho&s;e per&s;ons who were affected in this violent manner, recovered in two or three days.</P>
<P>I MET with one in&s;tance of this fever attacking with coma, and another with convul&s;ions, and with many in&s;tances in which it was introduced by a delirium.</P>
<P>THE pains which accompanied this fever were ex|qui&s;itely &s;evere in the head, back, and limbs. The pains in the head were &s;ometimes in the back parts of it, and at other times they occupied only the eyeballs. In &s;ome people, the pains were &s;o acute in their backs and hips, that they could not lie in bed. In others, the pains affected the neck and arms, &s;o as to pro|duce in one in&s;tance a difficulty of moving the fingers of the right hand. They all complained more or le&s;s of a &s;orene&s;s in the &s;eats of the&s;e pains, particularly when they occupied the head and eyeballs. A few complained of their fle&s;h being &s;ore to the touch, in every part of the body. From the&s;e circum&s;tances, the di&s;ea&s;e was &s;ometimes believed to be a rheumati&s;m. But its more general name among all cla&s;&s;es of people was, the <HI>Break-bone fever.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="022123_0090_0FB6E959691F1D68">
I MET with one ca&s;e of pain in the back, and ano|ther of an acute ear-ach, both of which returned pe|riodically every night, and without any fever.</P>
<P>A NAUSEA univer&s;ally, and in &s;ome in&s;tances, a vomiting, accompanied by a di&s;agreeable ta&s;te in the mouth, attended this fever. The bowels were, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, regular, except where the di&s;ea&s;e fell with its whole force upon them, producing a &s;ymptomatic dy&s;entery<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A &s;ymptomatic dy&s;entery frequently accompanies the autumnal fevers in Penn&s;ylvania.

<P>THE tongue was generally moi&s;t, and tinctured of a yellow color.</P>
<P>THE urine was high coloured, and in its u&s;ual quantity in fevers.</P>
<P>THE &s;kin was generally moi&s;t, e&s;pecially where the di&s;ea&s;e terminated on the third or fourth day.</P>
<P>THE pul&s;e was quick and full, but never hard in a &s;ingle patient that came under my care, till the 28th of September.</P>
<P>IT was remarkable, that little, and in &s;ome in&s;tances, no thir&s;t attended this fever.</P>
<P>A SCREATUS, or con&s;tant hawking and &s;pitting, attended in many ca&s;es through the whole di&s;ea&s;e, and was a favourable &s;ymptom.</P>
<P>THERE were generally remi&s;&s;ions in this fever every morning, and &s;ometimes in the evening. The
<PB N="94" REF="022123_0091_0FB6E95A9E472CC8">
exacerbations were more &s;evere every other day, and two exacerbations were often ob&s;erved in one day.</P>
<P>A RASH often appeared on the third and fourth days, which proved favourable. This ra&s;h was ac|companied in &s;ome ca&s;es by a burning in the palms of the hands and &s;oles of the feet. Many people at this time, who were not confined to their beds, and &s;ome, who had no fever, had an efflore&s;cence on their &s;kins.</P>
<P>IN &s;everal per&s;ons the force of the di&s;ea&s;e &s;eemed to fall upon the face, producing &s;wellings under the jaw and in the ears, which in &s;ome in&s;tances terminat|ed in ab&s;ce&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>WHEN the fever did not terminate on the third or fourth day, it frequently ran on to the eleventh, four|teenth, and even twentieth days, a&s;&s;uming in its pro|gre&s;s, according to its duration, the u&s;ual &s;ymptoms of the typhus gravior, or mitior, of Doctor Cullen. In &s;ome ca&s;es, the di&s;charge of a few &s;poonfuls of blood from the no&s;e accompanied a &s;olution of the fever on the third or fourth day; while in others, a profu&s;e haemorrhage from the no&s;e, mouth, and bowels, on the tenth and eleventh days, preceded a fatal i&s;&s;ue of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>SEVERAL ca&s;es came under my care, in which the fever was &s;ucceeded by a jaundice.</P>
<P>THE di&s;ea&s;e terminated in &s;ome ca&s;es without &s;weat|ing, or a &s;ediment in the urine; nor did I find &s;uch patients more di&s;po&s;ed to relap&s;e than others, pro|vided they took a &s;ufficient quantity of the bark.</P>

ABOUT the beginning of October the weather be|came cool, accompanied by rain and an ea&s;terly wind. This cool and wet weather continued for four days. The mercury in the thermometer fell to 60&deg;, and fires became agreeable. From this time the fever evidently declined, or was accompanied with inflammatory &s;ymp|toms. On the 16th of October, I met with a ca&s;e of inflammatory angina; and on the next day I vi|&s;ited a patient who had a complication of the bilious fever with a pleuri&s;y, and who&s;e blood di&s;covered &s;trong marks of the pre&s;ence of the inflammatory di|athe&s;is. His &s;tools were of a green and black color. On the third day of his di&s;order the ra&s;h appeared on his &s;kin, and on the fourth, in con&s;equence of a &s;econd bleeding, his fever terminated with the com|mon &s;ymptoms of a cri&s;is.</P>
<P>DURING the latter end of October, and the fir&s;t weeks in November, the mercury in the thermome|ter fluctuated between 50&deg; and 60&deg;. Pleuri&s;ies and inflammatory di&s;ea&s;es of all kinds now made their ap|pearance. They were more numerous and more acute, than in this &s;tage of the autumn, in former years. I met with one ca&s;e of pleuri&s;y in November, which did not yield to le&s;s than four plentiful bleedings.</P>
<P>I SHALL now add a &s;hort account of the METHOD I pur&s;ued in the treatment of this fever.</P>
<P>I GENERALLY began by giving a gentle vomit of tartar emetic. This medicine, if given while the fe|ver was in its forming &s;tate, frequently produced an immediate cure; and if given after its formation, on the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> day, &s;eldom &s;ailed of producing a cri&s;is on the third or fourth day. The vomit always di&s;charg|ed
<PB N="96" REF="022123_0093_0FB6E962A0613328">
more or le&s;s bile. If a nau&s;ea, or an ineffectual attempt to vomit continued after the exhibition of the tartar emetic, I gave a &s;econd do&s;e of it, with the happie&s;t effects.</P>
<P>IF the vomit failed of opening the bowels, I gave gentle do&s;es of &s;alts and cream of tartar<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have always found that cream of tartar renders the purging neutral &s;alts le&s;s di&s;agreeable to the ta&s;te and &s;tomach; but accident has lately taught me, that the juice of two limes or of one lemon, with about half an ounce of loaf &s;ugar added to &s;ix drachms of glauber or ep&s;om &s;alt, in half a pint of boiling water, from a mixture that is nearly as plea&s;ant as &s;trong beveridge.</NOTE>, or of the butter-nut pill<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This pill is made from an extract of a &s;trong decoction of the inner bark of the white walnut-tree.</NOTE>, &s;o as to procure two or three plentiful &s;tools. The matter di&s;charged from the bowels was of a highly bilious nature. It was &s;ometimes &s;o acrid as to excoriate the rectum, and &s;o offen&s;ive, as to occa&s;ion, in &s;ome ca&s;es, &s;ickne&s;s and faintine&s;s both in the patients and in their attendants. In every in|&s;tance the patients found relief by the&s;e evacuations, e&s;pecially from the pains in the head and limbs.</P>
<P>IN tho&s;e ca&s;es, where the prejudices of the pati|ents again&s;t an emetic, or where an advanced &s;tate of pregnancy, or an habitual predi&s;po&s;ition to hoemateme&s;is occurred, I di&s;charged the bile entirely by means of the lenient purges that have been mentioned. In this practice I had the example of Doctor Cleghorn, who pre&s;cribed purges with great &s;ucce&s;s in a fever of the &s;ame &s;pecies in Minorca, with that which has been de|&s;cribed<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">The <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> interpo<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ta remi&s;&s;ione tantum, of Dr. Cullen.</NOTE>. Doctor Lining pre&s;cribed purges with equal &s;ucce&s;s in an autumnal pleuri&s;y in South-Caro|lina, which I take to be a &s;pecies of a bilious remit|tent, accompanied by an inflammatory affection of the brea&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="022123_0094_0FB6E965AF0932E0">
AFTER evacuating the contents of the &s;tomach and bowels, I gave &s;mall do&s;es of tartar emetic mixed with Glauber's &s;alt. This medicine excited a general per&s;pira|tion. It likewi&s;e kept the bowels gently open, by which means the bile was di&s;charged as fa&s;t as it was accumulated.</P>
<P>I CONSTANTLY recommended to my patients, in this &s;tage of the di&s;order, to <HI>lie in bed.</HI> This favoured the eruption of the ra&s;h, and the &s;olution of the di&s;ea&s;e by per&s;piration. Per&s;ons who &s;truggled again&s;t the fever by <HI>&s;itting up,</HI> or who attempted to &s;hake it off by labor or exerci&s;e, either &s;unk under it, or had a &s;low recovery.</P>
<P>A CLERGYMAN of a re&s;pectable character from the country, who was attacked by the di&s;ea&s;e in the city, returned home, from a de&s;ire of being attended by his own family, and died in a few days afterwards. This is only one, of many ca&s;es, in which I have ob|&s;erved travelling, even in the ea&s;ie&s;t carriages, to prove fatal in fevers after they were formed, or after the fir&s;t &s;ymptoms had &s;hewn them&s;elves. The quicke&s;t and mo&s;t effectual way of conquering a fever, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, is, by an early &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to it.</P>
<P>THE drinks I recommended to my patients were &s;age and baum teas, apple<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That apple-water is mo&s;t agreeable which is made by pouring boiling water upon &s;lices of raw apples. It is more lively than that which is made by pouring the water on roa&s;ted apples.</NOTE> and tamarind water, weak punch, lemonade, and wine whey.</P>
<P>I FOUND obvious advantages in many ca&s;es, from the u&s;e of pediluvia, every night.</P>
<P>IN every ca&s;e, I found my patients refre&s;hed and relieved, by frequent changes of their linen.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="022123_0095_0FB6E9665B4AF428">
ON the third or fourth day, in the forenoon; the pains in the head and back generally abated, with a &s;weat which was diffu&s;ed over the whole body. The pul&s;e at this time remained quick and weak. This was, however, no objection to the u&s;e of the bark, a few do&s;es of which immediately abated its quickne&s;s, and prevented a return of the fever.</P>
<P>IF the fever continued beyond the third or fourth day without an intermi&s;&s;ion, I always had recour&s;e to bli&s;ters. Tho&s;e which were applied to the neck, and behind the ears, produced the mo&s;t immediate good effects. They &s;eldom failed of producing an inter|mi&s;&s;ion in the fever, the day after they were applied. Where delirium or coma attended, I applied the bli&s;|ter to the neck on the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> day of the di&s;order. A worthy family in this city will always a&s;cribe the life of a promi&s;ing boy of ten years old, to the early ap|plication of a bli&s;ter to the neck, in this fever.</P>
<P>WHERE the fever did not yield to bli&s;ters, and a&s;&s;umed the &s;ymptoms of typhus gravior or mitior, I gave the medicines u&s;ually exhibited in both the &s;pecies of that fever.</P>
<P>I TOOK notice in the hi&s;tory of this fever, that it was &s;ometimes accompanied by the &s;ymptoms of a dy&s;entery. Where this di&s;order appeared, I pre&s;crib|ed lenient purges and opiates. Where the&s;e failed of &s;ucce&s;s, I gave the bark in the intermi&s;&s;ions of the pain in the bowels, and applied bli&s;ters to the wri&s;ts. The good effects of the&s;e remedies led me to conclude, that the dy&s;entery was the febris introver&s;a of Doctor Sydenham.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="022123_0096_0FB6E96C788A1B18">
I AM happy in having an opportunity, in this place, of bearing a te&s;timony in favor of the u&s;efulne&s;s of OPI|UM in this di&s;order, after the nece&s;&s;ary evacuations had been made. I yielded, in pre&s;cribing it at fir&s;t, to the earne&s;t &s;olicitations of my patients for &s;omething to give them relief from their in&s;upportable pains, par|ticularly when they were &s;eated in the eyeballs and head. Its &s;alutary effects in procuring &s;weat, and a remi&s;&s;ion of the fever, led me to pre&s;cribe it afterwards in almo&s;t every ca&s;e, and always with the happie&s;t ef|fects. Tho&s;e phy&s;icians enjoy but little plea&s;ure in practi&s;ing phy&s;ic, who know not how much of the pain and angui&s;h of fevers, of a certain kind, may be le&s;&s;ened, by the judicious u&s;e of opium.</P>
<P>IN treating of the remedies u&s;ed in this di&s;order, I have taken no notice of blood-letting. Out of &s;eve|ral hundred patients whom I vi&s;ited in this fever, I did not meet with a &s;ingle ca&s;e, before the 27th of September, in which the &s;tate of the pul&s;e indicated this evacuation. It is true, the pul&s;e was <HI>full,</HI> but ne|ver <HI>hard.</HI> I acknowledge that I was called to &s;everal patients who had been bled without the advice of a phy&s;ician, who recovered afterwards on the u&s;ual days of the &s;olution of the fever. This can only be a&s;crib|ed to that di&s;po&s;ition which Doctor Cleghorn attributes to fevers, to pre&s;erve their types under every variety of treatment, as well as con&s;titution. But I am bound to declare further, that I heard of &s;everal ca&s;es, in which bleeding was followed by a fatal termination of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>IN this fever relap&s;es were very frequent, from ex|po&s;ure to the rain, &s;un, or night-air, and from an ex|ce&s;s in eating or drinking.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="022123_0097_0FB6E6BAAF1158D0">
THE CONVALESCENCE from this di&s;ea&s;e was mark|ed with a number of extraordinary &s;ymptoms, which rendered patients the &s;ubjects of medical attention for many days after the pul&s;e became perfectly regular, and after the cri&s;is of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>A BITTER ta&s;te in the mouth, accompanied by a yellow color of the tongue, continued for near a week.</P>
<P>MOST of tho&s;e who recovered, complained of nau|&s;ea and a total want of appetite. A faintine&s;s, e&s;pe|cially upon &s;itting up in bed, or in a chair, followed this fever. A weakne&s;s in the knees was univer&s;al. I met with two patients, who were mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible of this weakne&s;s in the right knee. An inflammation in one eye, and in &s;ome in&s;tances in both eyes, occurred in &s;everal patients after their recovery.</P>
<P>BUT the mo&s;t remarkable &s;ymptom of the conva|le&s;cence from this fever, was an uncommon dejection of &s;pirits. I attended two young ladies who &s;hed tears while they vented their complaints of their &s;ickne&s;s and weakne&s;s. One of them very aptly propo&s;ed to me, to change the name of the di&s;order, and to call it, in its pre&s;ent &s;tage, in&s;tead of the Break-bone, the <HI>Break-heart fever.</HI></P>
<P>TO remove the&s;e &s;ymptoms, I gave the tincture of bark and elixir of vitriol in frequent do&s;es. I likewi&s;e recommended the plentiful u&s;e of ripe fruits; but I &s;aw the be&s;t effects from temperate meals of oy&s;ters, and a liberal u&s;e of porter.

<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF THE Scarlatina Angino&s;a, AS IT APPEARED IN PHILADELPHIA, IN THE YEARS 1783 AND 1784.</HEAD>
<P>THE beginning of the month of July was unu&s;u|ally cool; in&s;omuch that the mercury in Fa|renheit's thermometer &s;tood at 61&deg; in the day time, and fires were very comfortable, e&s;pecially in the even|ing. In the la&s;t week but one, of this month, the weather &s;uddenly became &s;o warm, that the mercury ro&s;e to 94 1/2&deg;, at which it remained for three days. As this heat was accompanied by no breeze from any quarter, the &s;en&s;e of it was extremely di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to many people. Upwards of twenty per&s;ons died in the cour&s;e of the&s;e three days, from the exce&s;s of the heat, and from drinking cold water. Three old people died &s;uddenly within this &s;pace of time. This extreme heat was &s;ucceeded by cool weather, the mercury hav|ing fallen to 63&deg;, and the month clo&s;ed with produc|ing a few intermitting and remitting fevers, together with &s;everal ca&s;es of inflammatory angina.</P>
<P>THE weather in the month of Augu&s;t was extremely variable. The mercury, after &s;tanding for &s;everal days
<PB N="102" REF="022123_0099_0FB6E6C5913EA088">
at 92&deg;, &s;uddenly fell &s;o low, as not only to render fires nece&s;&s;ary, but in many places, to produce fro&s;t.</P>
<P>EVERY genus of fever made its appearance in this month. The &s;ynocha was &s;o acute, in &s;everal ca&s;es, as to require from three to four bleedings. The remitting fever was accompanied by an uncommon de|gree of nau&s;ea and faintine&s;s. Several people died, after a few days illne&s;s, of the typhus gravior, of Doctor Cullen. The intermittents had nothing pecu|liar in them, either as to their &s;ymptoms or method of cure.</P>
<P>TOWARDS the clo&s;e of the month, the &s;carlatina angino&s;a made its appearance, chiefly among children.</P>
<P>THE month of September was cool and dry, and the &s;carlatina angino&s;a became epidemic among adults as well as young people. In mo&s;t of the patients who were affected by it, it came on with a chilline&s;s and a &s;ickne&s;s at the &s;tomach, or a vomiting; which la&s;t was &s;o invariably pre&s;ent, that it was with me a pa|thognomonic &s;ign of the di&s;ea&s;e. The matter di&s;charged from the &s;tomach was always bile. The &s;welling of the throat was, in &s;ome in&s;tances, &s;o great, as to pro|duce a difficulty of &s;peaking, &s;wallowing, and breath|ing. In a few in&s;tances, the &s;peech was accompanied by a &s;queaking voice, re&s;embling that which attends the cynanche trachealis. The ulcers on the ton&s;ils were deep, and covered with white, and in &s;ome in&s;tances, with black &s;loughs. In &s;everal ca&s;es there was a di&s;|charge of a thick mucus from the no&s;e, from the be|ginning, but it oftener occurred in the decline of the di&s;ea&s;e, which mo&s;t frequently happened on the fifth day. Sometimes the &s;ub&s;iding of the &s;welling of the throat was followed by a &s;welling behind the ears.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="022123_0100_0FB6E6C710501238">
AN eruption on the &s;kin generally attended the &s;ymptoms which have been de&s;cribed. But this &s;ymp|tom appeared with con&s;iderable variety. In &s;ome peo|ple it preceded, and in others followed the ulcers and &s;welling of the throat. In &s;ome, it appeared only on the out&s;ide of the throat and on the brea&s;t; in others, it appeared chiefly on the limbs. In a few, it appear|ed on the &s;econd or third day of the di&s;order, and never returned afterwards. I &s;aw two ca&s;es of erup|tion without a &s;ingle &s;ymptom of the &s;ore throat. The face of one of tho&s;e patients was &s;welled, as in the ery&s;ipelas. In the other, a young girl of &s;even years old, there was only a &s;light redne&s;s on the &s;kin. She was &s;eized with a vomiting, and died delirious in fifty-four hours. Soon after her death, a livid color appear|ed on the out&s;ide of her throat.</P>
<P>THE bowels, in this degree of the di&s;order, were in general, regular. I can recollect but few ca&s;es which were attended by a diarrhoea.</P>
<P>THE fever which accompanied the di&s;order was generally the typhus mitior of Doctor Cullen. In a few ca&s;es it a&s;&s;umed the &s;ymptoms of the typhus gravior.</P>
<P>THE di&s;ea&s;e frequently went off with a &s;welling of the hands and feet. I &s;aw one in&s;tance in a gentle|woman, in whom this &s;welling was ab&s;ent, who com|plained of very acute pains, in her limbs, re&s;embling tho&s;e of the rheumati&s;m.</P>
<P>IN two ca&s;es which terminated fatally, there were large ab&s;ce&s;&s;es; the one on the out&s;ide, and the other on the in&s;ide of the throat. The fir&s;t of the&s;e ca&s;es was accompanied by trouble&s;ome &s;ores on the ends of
<PB N="104" REF="022123_0101_0FB6E6D8D771E848">
the fingers. One of the&s;e patients lived twenty-eight, and the other above thirty days, and both appeared to die from the di&s;charge which followed the opening of their ab&s;ce&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>BETWEEN the degrees of the di&s;ea&s;e which I have de&s;cribed, there were many intermediate degrees of indi&s;po&s;ition which belonged to this di&s;order.</P>
<P>I SAW in &s;everal ca&s;es a di&s;charge from behind the ears, and from the no&s;e, with a &s;light eruption, and no &s;ore throat. All the&s;e patients were able to &s;it up and walk about.</P>
<P>I SAW one in&s;tance of a di&s;charge from the in&s;ide of one of the ears in a child, who had ulcers in his throat and the &s;queaking voice.</P>
<P>IN &s;ome, a pain in the jaw, with &s;wellings behind the ears and a &s;light fever, con&s;tituted the whole of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>IN one ca&s;e, the di&s;ea&s;e came on with a coma, and in &s;everal patients it went off with this &s;ymptom.</P>
<P>A FEW in&s;tances occurred of adults, who walked about, and even tran&s;acted bu&s;ine&s;s until a few hours before they died.</P>
<P>THE intermitting fever, which made its appearance in Augu&s;t, was not lo&s;t during this month. It con|tinued to prevail, but with &s;everal peculiar &s;ymptoms. In many per&s;ons it was accompanied by an eruption on the &s;kin, and a &s;welling of the hands and feet. In &s;ome, it was attended by a &s;ore throat and pains be|hind
<PB N="105" REF="022123_0102_0FB6E6DA08C08250">
the ears. Indeed, &s;uch was the prevalence of the contagion which produced the &s;carlatina angino&s;a, that many hundred people complained of &s;ore throats without any other &s;ymptom of indi&s;po&s;ition. The &s;lighte&s;t occa&s;ional or exciting cau&s;e, and particularly cold, &s;eldom failed of producing the di&s;order.</P>
<P>THE month of October was much cooler than Sep|tember, and the di&s;ea&s;e continued, but with le&s;s alarm|ing &s;ymptoms. In &s;everal adults, who were &s;eized with it, the hardne&s;s of the pul&s;e indicated blood-let|ting. The blood, in one ca&s;e, was covered with a buffy coat, but beneath its &s;urface it was di&s;&s;olved.</P>
<P>IN the month of November the di&s;ea&s;e a&s;&s;umed &s;everal inflammatory &s;ymptoms, and was attended with much le&s;s danger than formerly. I vi&s;ited one pati|ent, who&s;e &s;ymptoms were &s;o inflammatory as to re|quire two bleedings. During the decline of the di&s;|ea&s;e, many people complained of trouble&s;ome &s;ores on the ends of their fingers. A number of children like|wi&s;e had &s;ore throats and fever, with eruptions on their &s;kins, which re&s;embled the chicken-pox. I am di&s;po&s;ed to &s;u&s;pect that this eruption was the effect of the contagion of the &s;carlatina angino&s;a, as &s;everal in|&s;tances occurred of patients who had all the &s;ymptoms of this di&s;ea&s;e, in whom an eruption of white bli&s;ters &s;ucceeded their recovery. This form of the di&s;ea&s;e has been called by Sauvage, the &s;carlatina variolo&s;a.</P>
<P>I SAW one ca&s;e of &s;ore throat, which was &s;ucceed|ed not only by &s;wellings in the abdomen and limbs, but by a catarrh, which brought on a fatal con&s;ump|tion.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="022123_0103_0FB6E6E7EAF14940">
A CONSIDERABLE &s;hock of an earthquake was felt on the 29th of this month, at ten o'clock at night, in the city of Philadelphia; but no change was per|ceived in the di&s;ea&s;e, in con&s;equence of it.</P>
<P>IN December, January, and February, the weather was inten&s;ely cold. There was a thaw for a few days in January, which broke the ice of the Delaware, but it was followed by cold &s;o exce&s;&s;ive as to clo&s;e the river till the beginning of March. The mercury on the 28th and 29th of February, &s;tood below 0 in Faren|heit's thermometer.</P>
<P>FOR a few weeks in the beginning of December the di&s;ea&s;e di&s;appeared in the circle of my patients, but it broke out with great violence the latter end of that month, and in the January following. Some of the wor&s;t ca&s;es that I met with, (three of which proved fatal) were in tho&s;e two months.</P>
<P>THE di&s;ea&s;e di&s;appeared in the &s;pring, but it &s;pread afterwards through the neighbouring &s;tates of New-Jer&s;ey, Delaware and Maryland.</P>
<P>I SHALL now add an account of the remedies which I admini&s;tered in this di&s;order.</P>
<P>IN every ca&s;e that I was called to, I began the cure by giving a vomit joined with calomel. The vomit was either tartar emetic or ipecacuana, according to the prejudices, habits, or con&s;titutions of my patients. A quantity of bile was generally di&s;charged by this medicine. Be&s;ides evacuating the contents of the &s;tomach, it clean&s;ed the throat in its pa&s;&s;age down|wards. To en&s;ure this effect from the calomel, I al|ways
<PB N="107" REF="022123_0104_0FB6E6EB1408FF70">
directed it to be given mixed with &s;yrup or &s;ugar and water, &s;o as to diffu&s;e it generally over every part of the throat. The calomel &s;eldom failed to produce two or three &s;tools. In &s;everal ca&s;es I was obliged, by the continuance of nau&s;ea, to repeat the emetics, and always with immediate and obvious advantage. I gave the calomel in moderate do&s;es in every &s;tage of the di&s;order. To re&s;train its purgative effects, I add|ed to it a &s;mall quantity of opium.</P>
<P>DURING the whole cour&s;e of the di&s;order, where the calomel failed of opening the bowels, I gave leni|ent purges, when a di&s;po&s;ition to co&s;tivene&s;s required them.</P>
<P>THE throat was kept clean by detergent gargles. In &s;everal in&s;tances I &s;aw evident advantages from add|ing a few grains of calomel to them. In ca&s;es of great difficulty of &s;wallowing or breathing, the patients found relief from receiving the &s;teams of warm water mixed with a little vinegar, through a funnel into the throat.</P>
<P>A PERSPIRATION kept up by gentle do&s;es of an|timonials, and diluting drinks, impregnated with wine, always gave relief.</P>
<P>IN every ca&s;e which did not yield to the above re|medies on the third day, I applied a bli&s;ter behind each ear, or one to the neck, and I think, always with good effects.</P>
<P>I MET with no ca&s;es in which the bark appeared to be indicated as an anti&s;eptic, except the three in which the di&s;ea&s;e proved fatal. Where the &s;ore throat
<PB N="108" REF="022123_0105_0FB6E6ECE9290490">
was blended with the intermitting fever, the bark was given with advantage. But in common ca&s;es it was unnece&s;&s;ary. Sub&s;equent ob&s;ervations have led me to believe, with Doctor Withering, that it is &s;ometimes hurtful in this di&s;order.</P>
<P>THIS di&s;ea&s;e proved fatal in many parts of the country, upon its fir&s;t appearance; but wherever the mode of treatment here delivered, was adopted, its mortality was &s;oon checked. The calomel was u&s;ed very generally in New-Jer&s;ey and New-York. In the Delaware &s;tate, a phy&s;ician of character made it a prac|tice not only to give calomel, but to anoint the out|&s;ide of the throat with mercurial ointment.</P>

<HEAD>Additional Ob&s;ervations UPON THE Scarlatina Angino&s;a.</HEAD>
<P>THIS di&s;ea&s;e has prevailed in Philadelphia, at dif|ferent &s;ea&s;ons, ever &s;ince the year 1783. It has blended it&s;elf occa&s;ionally with all our epidemics. Many ca&s;es have come under my notice &s;ince its fir&s;t appearance, in which drop&s;ical &s;wellings have &s;ucceed|ed the fever. In &s;ome in&s;tances there appeared to be effu&s;ions of water not only in the limbs and abdomen, but in the thorax. They yielded, in every ca&s;e that I attended, to purges of calomel and jalap. Where the&s;e &s;wellings were neglected, they &s;ometimes proved fatal.</P>
<P>IN the winter of 1786, 7, the &s;carlatina angino&s;a was blended with the cynanche parotidea, and in one in&s;tance with a typhus mitior. The la&s;t was in a young girl of nine years of age. She was &s;eized with a vomit|ing of bile and an efflore&s;cence on her brea&s;t, but di&s;co|vered no other &s;ymptoms of the &s;carlatina angino&s;a till the &s;ixteenth day of her fever, when a &s;welling appear|ed on the out&s;ide of her throat; and after her recovery, a pain and &s;welling in one of her knees.</P>
<P>IN the month of July 1787, a number of people were affected by &s;udden &s;wellings of their lips and eyelids. The&s;e &s;wellings generally came on in the night, were attended with little or no pain, and went off in two
<PB N="110" REF="022123_0107_0FB6E6F7EE985070">
or three days. I met with only one ca&s;e in which there was a different i&s;&s;ue to the&s;e &s;ymptoms. It was in a patient in the Penn&s;ylvania ho&s;pital, in whom a &s;welling in the lips ended in a &s;uppuration, which, notwith&s;tanding the liberal u&s;e of bark and wine, proved fatal in the cour&s;e of twelve days.</P>
<P>IN the months of June and July 1788, a number of people were affected by &s;udden &s;wellings, not only of the upper and lower lips, but of the cheeks and throat. At the &s;ame time many per&s;ons were affected by an inflammation of the eyes. The &s;wellings were attended with more pain than they were the year be|fore, and &s;ome of them required one or two purges to remove them; but in general they went off without medicine, in two or three days.</P>
<P>Is it proper to refer the&s;e complaints to the &s;ame contagion which produces the &s;carlatina angino&s;a?</P>
<P>THE prevalence of the &s;carlatina angino&s;a at the <HI>&s;ame time</HI> in the city; its di&s;po&s;ition to produce &s;wel|lings in different parts of the body; and the analogy of the intermitting fever, which often conceals it&s;elf under &s;ymptoms that are foreign to its u&s;ual type; all &s;eem to render this conjecture probable. In one of the ca&s;es of an inflammation of the eye, which came under my notice, the patient was affected by a vomiting ua few hors before the inflammation appeared, and com|plained of a &s;ickne&s;s at his &s;tomach for two or three days afterwards. Now a vomiting and nau&s;ea appear to be pathognomonic &s;ymptoms of the &s;carlatina angino&s;a.</P>
<P>IN the autumn of 1788, the &s;carlatina angino&s;a ap|peared with different degrees of violence in many parts of the city. In two in&s;tances it appeared with an ob|&s;tinate
<PB N="111" REF="022123_0108_0FB6E6FA21A16FA0">
diarrhoea; but it was in young &s;ubjects, and not in adults, as de&s;cribed by Doctor Withering. In both ca&s;es, the di&s;ea&s;e proved fatal; the one on the third, the other on the fifth day.</P>
<P>IN the month of December of the &s;ame year, I &s;aw one ca&s;e in which a running from one of the ears and a deafne&s;s came on, on the fifth day, immediately after the di&s;charge of mucus from the no&s;e had cea&s;ed. This ca&s;e terminated favourably on the ninth day, but was &s;ucceeded for &s;everal days afterwards by a trouble|&s;ome cough.</P>
<P>I SHALL conclude this e&s;&s;ay by the following re|marks.</P>
<P N="1">1. CAMPHOR has often been &s;u&s;pended in a bag from the neck, as a pre&s;ervative again&s;t this di&s;ea&s;e. Repeated ob&s;ervations have taught me, that it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es little or no efficacy for this purpo&s;e. I have had rea|&s;on to entertain a more favourable opinion of the be|nefit of wa&s;hing the hands and face with vinegar, and of rin&s;ing the mouth and throat with vinegar and water every morning, as a means of preventing this di&s;order.</P>
<P N="2">2. WHENEVER I have been called to a patient where the &s;carlatina appeared to be in a <HI>forming</HI> &s;tate, a vomit of ipecacuana, or tartar emetic, mixed with a few grains of calomel, has never failed of completely checking the di&s;order, or of &s;o far mitigating its violence, as to di&s;|po&s;e it to a favourable i&s;&s;ue in a few days; and if the&s;e ob&s;ervations &s;hould &s;erve no other purpo&s;e, than to a|waken the early attention of patients and phy&s;icians to this &s;peedy and effectual remedy, they will not have been recorded in vain.</P>

<HEAD>AN INQUIRY INTO THE CAUSE AND CURE OF THE Cholera Infantum.</HEAD>
<P>BY this name I mean to de&s;ignate a di&s;ea&s;e, called, in Philadelphia, the <Q>vomiting and purging of children.</Q> From the regularity of its appearance in the &s;ummer months, it is likewi&s;e known by the name of "the di&s;ea&s;e of the &s;ea&s;on." It prevails in mo&s;t of the large towns in the United States. It is di&s;tingui&s;hed in Charle&s;ton, in South-Carolina, by the name of "the April and May di&s;order," from making its fir&s;t appearance in tho&s;e two months. It &s;eldom appears in Philadelphia till the middle of June, or the beginning of July, and generally continues till near the middle of September. Its frequency and danger are always in proportion to the heat of the weather. It affects children from the fir&s;t or &s;econd week after their birth, till they are two years old. It &s;ometimes begins with a diarrhoea, which continues for &s;everal days without any other &s;ymptom of indi&s;po&s;iti|on; but it more frequently comes on with a violent vomiting and purging and a high fever. The matter di&s;charged from the &s;tomach and bowels is generally yellow or green, but the &s;tools are &s;ometimes &s;limy and bloody, without any tincture of bile. In &s;ome
<PB N="113" REF="022123_0110_0FB6E704B604BC40">
in&s;tances they are nearly as limpid as water. Worms are frequently di&s;charged in each kind of the &s;tools that has been de&s;cribed. The children in this &s;tage of the di&s;order, appear to &s;uffer a good deal of pain. They draw up their feet, and are never ea&s;y in one po&s;|ture. The pul&s;e is quick and weak. The head is un|u&s;ually warm, while the extremities retain their natu|ral heat, or incline to be cold. The fever is of the remitting kind, and di&s;covers evident exacerbations, e&s;pecially in the evenings. The di&s;ea&s;e affects the head &s;o much, as in &s;ome in&s;tances to produce &s;ymptoms not only of delirium, but of mania, in&s;omuch that the children throw their heads backwards and for|wards, and &s;ometimes make attempts to &s;cratch, and to bite, their parents or nur&s;es. A &s;welling frequently occurs in the abdomen, and in the face and limbs. An inten&s;e thir&s;t attends every &s;tage of the di&s;order. The eyes appear languid and hollow, and the children ge|nerally &s;leep with them half clo&s;ed. Such is the in&s;en|&s;ibility of the &s;y&s;tem in &s;ome in&s;tances in this di&s;order, that flies have been &s;een to alight upon the eyes when opened, without exciting a motion in the eyelids to remove them. Sometimes the vomiting continues without the purging, but more generally, the purging continues without the vomiting, through the whole cour&s;e of the di&s;order. The &s;tools are frequently large, and extremely foetid, but in &s;ome in&s;tances, they are without &s;mell, and re&s;emble the drinks or ali|ment which had been taken into the body. The di&s;|ea&s;e is &s;ometimes fatal in a few days. I once &s;aw it carry off a child in four and twenty hours. Its durati|on is varied by the &s;ea&s;on of the year, and by the changes in the temperature of the weather. A cool day frequently abates its violence, and di&s;po&s;es it to a favourable termination. It often continues with occa|&s;ional
<PB N="114" REF="022123_0111_0FB6E706125515B0">
variations in its appearance, for &s;ix weeks or two months. Where the di&s;ea&s;e has been of long conti|nuance, the approach of death is gradual, and attend|ed by a number of di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;ymptoms. An emacia|tion of the body, to &s;uch a degree as that the bones come through the &s;kin, livid &s;pots, a &s;ingultus, con|vul&s;ions, a &s;trongly marked hippocratic countenance, and a &s;ore mouth, generally precede the fatal termina|tion of this di&s;order. Few children ever recover, after the la&s;t &s;ymptoms which have been mentioned make their appearance.</P>
<P>THIS di&s;ea&s;e has been a&s;cribed to &s;everal cau&s;es; of each of which I &s;hall take notice in order.</P>
<P>I. IT has been attributed to <HI>dentition.</HI> To refute this opinion, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that it ap|pears only in one &s;ea&s;on of the year. Dentition I acknowledge &s;ometimes aggravates the di&s;order; hence we find it is mo&s;t &s;evere in that period of life, when the greate&s;t number of teeth make their appearance, which is generally about the tenth month. I think I have ob&s;erved more children to die of this di&s;order at that age, than at any other.</P>
<P>II. WORMS have likewi&s;e been &s;u&s;pected of being the cau&s;e of this di&s;ea&s;e. To this opinion, I object the uncertainty of worms ever producing an idiopathic fever, and the improbability of their combining in &s;uch a manner as to produce an annual epidemic di&s;ea&s;e of any kind. But further, we often &s;ee the di&s;order in all its force, before that age, in which worms u&s;ually produce di&s;ea&s;es; we likewi&s;e often &s;ee it re&s;i&s;t the mo&s;t powerful anthelmintic medicines; and la&s;tly, it appears from di&s;&s;ection, where the di&s;ea&s;e has proved fatal, that
<PB N="115" REF="022123_0112_0FB6E70796C31660">
not a &s;ingle worm has been di&s;covered in the bowels. It is true worms are in &s;ome in&s;tances di&s;charged in this di&s;order, but they are frequently di&s;charged in greater numbers in the hydrocephalus internus, and in the &s;mall-pox, and yet who will a&s;&s;ert either of tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es to be produced by worms.</P>
<P>III. THE <HI>&s;ummer fruits</HI> have been accu&s;ed of pro|ducing this di&s;order. To this opinion, I object that the di&s;ea&s;e is but little known in country places, where children eat much more fruit than in cities. As far as I have ob&s;erved, I am di&s;po&s;ed to believe that the mo|derate u&s;e of ripe fruits, rather tends to prevent, than to induce the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>FROM the di&s;charge of bile which generally intro|duces the di&s;ea&s;e, from the remi&s;&s;ions and exacerbations of the fever which accompanies it, and from its occur|ring nearly in the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on with the cholera and re|mitting fever in adults, I am di&s;po&s;ed to con&s;ider it as a modification of the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;es. Its appear|ance earlier in the &s;ea&s;on than the cholera and remit|ting fever in adults, mu&s;t be a&s;cribed to the con&s;titu|tions of children being more predi&s;po&s;ed from weak|ne&s;s to be acted upon, by the remote cau&s;es which pro|duce tho&s;e di&s;orders.</P>
<P>I SHALL now mention the remedies which are pro|per and u&s;eful in this di&s;order.</P>
<P>I. THE fir&s;t indication of cure is to evacuate the bile from the &s;tomach and bowels. This &s;hould be done by gentle do&s;es of ipecacuana, or tartar emetic. The vomits &s;hould be repeated occa&s;ionally, if indi|cated, in every &s;tage of the di&s;order. The bowels
<PB N="116" REF="022123_0113_0FB6E7116C1055A0">
&s;hould be opened by means of manna, ca&s;tor oil, or magne&s;ia. I have generally found rhubarb improper for this purpo&s;e, while the &s;tomach was in a very irritable &s;tate. In tho&s;e ca&s;es, where there is rea&s;on to believe that the offending contents of the primae viae have been di&s;charged by nature, (which is often the ca&s;e) the emetics and purges &s;hould by no means be given; but, in&s;tead of them, recour&s;e mu&s;t be had to</P>
<P>II. OPIATES. A few drops of liquid laudanum, combined in a te&s;taceous julep, with pepper-mint or cinnamon-water, &s;eldom fail of compo&s;ing the &s;tomach and bowels. In &s;ome in&s;tances, this medicine alone &s;ubdues the di&s;ea&s;e in two or three days; but where it does not prove &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful, it produces a remi&s;&s;ion of pain, and of other di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;ymptoms, in every &s;tage of the di&s;order.</P>
<P>III. DEMULCENT and DILUTING DRINKS have an agreeable effect in this di&s;ea&s;e. Mint and mallows teas, or a tea made of blackberry roots infu&s;ed in cold water, together with a decoction of the &s;hayings of hart&s;horn and gum arabic with cinnamon, &s;hould all be given in their turns for this purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>IV. GLYSTERS made of flax&s;eed tea, or of mut|ton broth, or of &s;tarch di&s;&s;olved in water, with a few drops of liquid laudanum in them, give ea&s;e, and pro|duce other u&s;eful effects.</P>
<P>V. PLASTERS of venice treacle applied to the re|gion of the &s;tomach, and flannels dipped in infu&s;ions of bitter and aromatic herbs in warm &s;pirits, or Ma|deira wine, and applied to the region of the abdomen, often afford con&s;iderable relief.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="022123_0114_0FB6E715EF242D20">
VI. AS &s;oon as the more violent &s;ymptoms of the di&s;ea&s;e are compo&s;ed, TONIC and CORDIAL MEDI|CINES &s;hould be given. The bark in decoction, or in &s;ub&s;tance, (where it can be retained in that form) mixed with a little nutmeg, often produce the mo&s;t &s;alutary effects<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Several of the phy&s;icians of the Philadelphia Di&s;pen&s;ary have a&s;&s;ured me, that they have lately given in this di&s;order, (after the u&s;ual evacuations) from one grain to two grains of allum every two or three hours, as a tonic and an a&s;tringent, with great &s;ucce&s;s.</NOTE>. Port wine or claret mixed with water, are likewi&s;e proper in this &s;tage of the di&s;order. After the di&s;ea&s;e has continued for &s;ome time, we often &s;ee an appetite &s;uddenly awakened for articles of diet of a &s;timulating nature. I have &s;een many children recover from being gratified in an inclination to eat &s;alted fi&s;h, or the different kinds of &s;alted meat. In &s;ome in&s;tances they di&s;cover an appetite for butter, and the riche&s;t gravies of roa&s;ted meats, and eat them with obvious relief to all their &s;ymptoms. I once &s;aw a child of &s;ixteen months old, perfectly re&s;tored, from the lowe&s;t &s;tage of this di&s;order, by eating large quan|tities of rancid Engli&s;h chee&s;e, and drinking two or three gla&s;&s;es of port wine every day. She would in no in&s;tance eat bread with the chee&s;e, nor ta&s;te the wine, if it was mixed with water.</P>
<P>WE &s;ometimes &s;ee relief given by the u&s;e of the warm bath, in ca&s;es of ob&s;tinate pain. The bath is more effectual, if warm wine is u&s;ed, in&s;tead of water.</P>
<P>I HAVE had but few opportunities of trying the effects of cold water applied to the body in this di&s;|order; but from the benefit which attended its u&s;e in the ca&s;es in which it was pre&s;cribed, I am di&s;po&s;ed to believe that it would do great &s;ervice, could we over|come the prejudices which &s;ub&s;i&s;t in the minds of pa|rents again&s;t it.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="022123_0115_0FB6E71B93F705E0">
AFTER all that has been &s;aid in favor of the re|medies that have been mentioned, I am &s;orry to add, that I have very often &s;een them all admini&s;tered with|out effect. My principal dependance, therefore, for many years, has been placed upon</P>
<P>VII. COUNTRY AIR. Out of many hundred children whom I have &s;ent into the country in every &s;tage of this di&s;order, I have lo&s;t only three, two of whom were &s;ent, contrary to my advice, into that un|healthy part of the neighbourhood of Philadelphia call|ed the <HI>Neck,</HI> which lies between the city and the con|flux of the rivers Delaware and Schuylkill. I have &s;een one cure performed by this remedy, after convul|&s;ions had taken place. To derive the utmo&s;t benefit from the country air, children &s;hould be carried out on hor&s;eback, or in a carriage, every day; and they &s;hould be expo&s;ed to the open air as much as po&s;&s;ible in fair weather in the day time. Where the convenience of the con&s;tant benefit of country air cannot be obtained, I have &s;een evident advantages from taking children out of the city once or twice a day. It is extremely agreeable to &s;ee the little &s;ufferers revive, as &s;oon as they e&s;cape from the city air, and in&s;pire the pure air of the country.</P>
<P>I SHALL conclude this inquiry, by recommending the following methods of preventing this di&s;order, all of which have been found by experience to be u&s;eful.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE daily u&s;e of the cold bath.</P>
<P N="2">2. A FAITHFUL and attentive accommodation of the dre&s;&s;es of children, to the &s;tate and changes of the air.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="119" REF="022123_0116_0FB6E71CA09C7AF0">
3. A MODERATE quantity of &s;alted meat taken oc|ca&s;ionally in tho&s;e months in which this di&s;ea&s;e u&s;ually prevails. It is perhaps in part from the daily u&s;e of &s;alted meat in diet that the children of country people e&s;cape this di&s;order.</P>
<P N="4">4. THE u&s;e of &s;ound old wine in the &s;ummer months. From a tea-&s;poonful, to half a wine gla&s;s full, accord|ing to the age of the child may be given every day. It is remarkable, that the children of per&s;ons in ea&s;y circum&s;tances, who &s;ip occa&s;ionally with their parents, the remains of a gla&s;s of wine after dinner, are much le&s;s &s;ubject to this di&s;order, than the children of poor people who are without the benefit of that article of diet.</P>
<P N="5">5. CLEANLINESS both with re&s;pect to the &s;kin and cloathing of children. Perhaps the neglect of this di|rection may be another rea&s;on why the children of the poor are mo&s;t &s;ubject to this di&s;order.</P>
<P N="6">6. THE removal of children into the country before the approach of warm weather. This advice is pecu|liarly nece&s;&s;ary during the whole period of dentition. I have never known but one in&s;tance of a child being affected by this di&s;order, who had been carried into the country in order to avoid it.</P>

<P>I TAKE great plea&s;ure in thus publicly acknow|ledging a mi&s;take, which I committed in my letter to Doctor Millar, publi&s;hed by him in London in the year 1770, in &s;uppo&s;ing that there was but <HI>one</HI> &s;pecies of this di&s;order, and that that was <HI>&s;pa&s;modic.</HI> I am now &s;atisfied, from repeated ob&s;ervations, that there is another &s;pecies, which I &s;hall take the liberty of calling the <HI>cynanche trachealis humida.</HI></P>
<P>I EXCLUDE, as a &s;pecies of this di&s;order, the cy|nanche trachealis maligna. Many of the &s;ymptoms of the cynanche trachealis occur in the malignant &s;ore throat, but they &s;hould by no means con&s;titute the name, or a &s;pecies of that di&s;ea&s;e. I have &s;een the &s;ame &s;ymptoms in the &s;carlatina angino&s;a, and yet I never thought of ranking a cynanche trachealis &s;carla|tina among the &s;pecies of that di&s;order. I have like|wi&s;e &s;een the cynanche trachealis in the la&s;t &s;tage of the &s;econdary fever of the &s;mall-pox, without &s;uppo&s;ing that it ought to derive a &s;pecific name from that di&s;ea&s;e. The &s;pecies of diarrhoea would be innumerable, if, every time it occurred as a &s;ymptom of other di&s;or|ders, it was to receive a &s;pecific name, and to be con|&s;idered as an idiopathic di&s;order.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="022123_0118_0FB6E7255826C510">
THE rea&s;ons which I offered in my letter to Doc|tor Millar, for believing that the cynanche trachealis is frequently a &s;pa&s;modic di&s;order, continue to operate upon me with as much force as ever. But a number of di&s;&s;ections, related by different authors, &s;atisfy me, that the cynanche trachealis humida is a di&s;tinct &s;pecies from the &s;pa&s;modic, and requires a different method of cure.</P>
<P>THE cynanche trachealis &s;pa&s;modica is known,</P>
<P N="1">1. BY coming on <HI>&s;uddenly,</HI> and that generally in the night.</P>
<P N="2">2. BY frequent and perfect <HI>intermi&s;&s;ions</HI> of the &s;ymp|toms for hours, and in &s;ome in&s;tances for days, with|out the lea&s;t &s;en&s;ible di&s;charge from the trachea. And,</P>
<P N="3">3. BY yielding to anti&s;pa&s;modic remedies, particu|larly to the warm bath.</P>
<P>IF the&s;e facts had left any rea&s;on to doubt of a &s;pa&s;|modic &s;pecies of this di&s;order, I &s;hould have been con|firmed in the opinion, by the di&s;&s;ection of a child in the year 1770, who died by it, in whom no marks were to be found of a membrane, or even of mucus in the trachea. The lungs and trachea appeared to be in a &s;ound &s;tate.</P>
<P>THE cynanche trachealis humida is known,</P>
<P N="1">1. BY coming on <HI>gradually,</HI> and that mo&s;t com|monly in the day time.</P>
<P N="2">2. BY its continuing or increa&s;ing for &s;everal days without any remarkable remi&s;&s;ion, or even abatement of the &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="122" REF="022123_0119_0FB6E72650965298">
3. BY the di&s;charge of phlegm or mucus from the trachea, and the occa&s;ional appearance of it in the &s;tools. And,</P>
<P N="4">4. BY not yielding to anti&s;pa&s;modic medicines.</P>
<P>MY opinion of the cau&s;e of the membrane which is formed in the trachea, continues to be the &s;ame as expre&s;&s;ed in my former publication<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>The ve&s;&s;els of the trachea and bronchiae always abound with a thin mucus, which is poured into them in proportion as they are irritated by in|flammation, or the action of the external air. Children abound with a greater quantity of mucus in the&s;e parts than adults; and when it is accu|mulated in the trachea or bronchiae in a greater quantity than ordinary, they are unable, upon the account of their weakne&s;s, to bring it up. It is ea&s;y to conceive in what manner it is converted into a thin membrane, after its more fluid parts are di&s;&s;ipated. We have an analogy of this in the no&s;e. Were the pa&s;&s;ages of this organ le&s;s in our reach, it is probable a membrane re&s;embling that found in the trachea would be found in it every four and twenty hours, e&s;pecially when it was affected by a cold. We always find the phlegm accumulated in proportion to the time the di&s;order has continu|ed. In all the ca&s;es of membrane mentioned by Doctor Home, the pati|ents never died before the <HI>third</HI> day, and in many ca&s;es, not before the fourth and fifth days.</Q> <BIBL>Letter to Doctor Millar.</BIBL></NOTE>, with this dif|ference, that I believe the membrane to be the effect of the humid &s;pecies only, and that it is not an acciden|tal con&s;equence of the &s;pa&s;modic, as I once &s;uppo&s;ed. During the paroxy&s;ms of the di&s;order, the &s;ymptoms are nearly the &s;ame in both &s;pecies. They are de&s;cribed by Doctor Millar, in his ob&s;ervations on the a&s;thma and hooping cough, in the following words: <Q>Children (&s;ays he) at play were &s;ometimes &s;eized with it, but it generally came on at night. A child who went to bed in perfect health, waked an hour or two af|terwards in a fright, with his face much flu&s;hed, or &s;ometimes of a livid color; incapable of de&s;cribing what he felt; breathing with much labor, and with a convul&s;ive motion in the belly; the returns of in&s;piration and expiration quickly &s;ucceeding each
<PB N="123" REF="022123_0120_0FB6E727E3F035E8">
other in that particular &s;onorous manner, which is often ob&s;erved in hy&s;teric paroxy&s;ms. The child's terror &s;ometimes augmented the di&s;order. He clung to the nur&s;e, and if he was not &s;peedily re|lieved by coughing, belching, &s;neezing, vomiting or purging, the &s;uffocation increa&s;ed, and he died in the paroxy&s;m.</Q></P>
<P>TO this de&s;cription of the cynanche trachealis, I beg leave to add the three following ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE noi&s;e which patients make in coughing in this di&s;order, re&s;embles the barking of a young dog. This &s;ymptom is &s;o univer&s;ally pre&s;ent, that I always rely upon it as a pathognomonic &s;ign of the di&s;ea&s;e before it is completely formed. I have ob&s;erved this barking cough, in one in&s;tance of cynanche trachealis humida, to continue for &s;everal days after the patient was out of danger.</P>
<P N="2">2. DURING the continuance of the di&s;ea&s;e there is frequently an eruption of little red blotches on the &s;kin, which is accompanied by &s;en&s;ible relief to the patient. This eruption &s;ometimes appears and di&s;appears two or three times in the cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE di&s;ea&s;e is not confined wholly to children. I have &s;een two ca&s;es of the &s;pa&s;modic &s;pecies in adults.</P>
<P>DOCTOR Cullen has given birth to a controver&s;y re&s;pecting the inflammatory nature of the cynanche trachealis. He has included it in the order of phleg|ma&s;iae in his cla&s;s of pyrexia. I acknowledge that I have generally &s;een both the &s;pecies that have been mentioned, without inflammatory &s;ymptoms, and &s;ome|times
<PB N="124" REF="022123_0121_0FB6E7296AF9F7E8">
without fever, e&s;pecially in the fir&s;t &s;tage of the di&s;order. When either &s;pecies has been attended by a hard pul&s;e, it has been only in plethoric habits, or when it has been complicated with &s;ymptoms of catarrh or peripneumony.</P>
<P>PERHAPS it may appear improper, after &s;uch a declaration, to have adopted the name given to this di&s;order by Doctor Cullen. I &s;hould have had no objection to Doctor Michaelis's name of "angina po|lypo&s;a," did it not exclude the &s;pa&s;modic &s;pecies of this di&s;ea&s;e; nor &s;hould I he&s;itate in adopting the more generic term of "&s;uffocatio &s;tridula" of Doctor Home, if the di&s;ea&s;e were not now &s;o generally known by the name given it by Doctor Cullen.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The vulgar name of this di&s;ea&s;e in Penn&s;ylvania is the <HI>Hives.</HI> It ap|pears to be a corruption of the word "heaves," which took its ri&s;e from the manner in which the lungs <HI>heave</HI> in re&s;piration. The wor&s;t degrees of the di&s;order are called the "bowel-hives," from the great motion of the abdomi|nal mu&s;cles in re&s;piration.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE remedies to be u&s;ed in cynanche trachealis &s;pa&s;modica, are, 1. Bleeding, when it is connected with pneumonic &s;ymptoms; 2. Vomits; 3. Purges; and, 4. Anti&s;pa&s;modic medicines, more e&s;pecially the warm bath, opium, a&s;&s;afoetida and bli&s;ters.</P>
<P>THE remedies which are proper in the cynanche trachealis humida, are the three fir&s;t which are men|tioned for the cure of the &s;pa&s;modic &s;pecies, and CALO|MEL. Our principal dependence mu&s;t be placed upon this la&s;t medicine. A large do&s;e of it &s;hould be given as &s;oon as the di&s;ea&s;e di&s;covers it&s;elf, and &s;maller do&s;es &s;hould be given every day, while any of its &s;ymptoms continue. The bark is &s;carcely a more certain remedy

<PB N="125" REF="022123_0122_0FB6E732D029C970">
for intermittents, than calomel, when thus admini&s;ter|ed, is in this &s;pecies of cynanche.</P>
<P>IN what manner does the calomel act in this di&s;or|der? Is it by <HI>increa&s;ing</HI> the &s;ecretion of mucus in the numerous glands of the fauces, oe&s;ophagus, &s;tomach and bowels, and thereby <HI>le&s;&s;ening</HI> the excretion of it in the trachea? The analogy of the &s;ecretions and excre|tions, in other parts of the body, whether promoted by nature or art, &s;eems to favour this conjecture.</P>
<P>I SHALL only add upon the &s;ubject of this di&s;order, that in&s;tances of its mortality have been very rare in Philadelphia, &s;ince the general u&s;e of the remedies which have been mentioned.</P>

<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF THE EFFECTS OF BLISTERS AND BLEEDING, IN THE CURE OF OBSTINATE Intermitting Fevers.</HEAD>
<P>THE efficacy of the&s;e remedies will probably be di&s;puted by every regular-bred phy&s;ician, who has not been a witne&s;s of their utility in the above di&s;order; but it becomes &s;uch phy&s;icians, before they decide upon this &s;ubject, to remember, that many things are true in medicine, as well as in other branches of philo&s;ophy, which are very improbable.</P>
<P>IN all tho&s;e ca&s;es of <HI>autumnal</HI> intermittents, whe|ther quotidian, tertian, or quartan, in which the bark did not &s;ucceed after three or four days trial, I have &s;eldom found it fail after the application of bli&s;ters to the wri&s;ts.</P>
<P>BUT in tho&s;e ca&s;es where bli&s;ters had been neglect|ed, or applied without effect, and where the di&s;ea&s;e had been protracted into the <HI>winter</HI> months, I have generally cured it by means of one or two moderate bleedings.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="022123_0124_0FB6E73B1A478618">
THE pul&s;e in tho&s;e ca&s;es, is generally full, and &s;ometimes a little hard, and the blood when drawn, for the mo&s;t part appears &s;izy.</P>
<P>THE bark is &s;eldom nece&s;&s;ary to prevent the return of the di&s;order. It is always ineffectual, where blood|letting is indicated. I have known &s;everal in&s;tances where pounds of this medicine have been taken with|out effect, in which the lo&s;s of ten or twelve ounces of blood has immediately cured the di&s;order.</P>
<P>HOW &s;hall we reconcile the practice of bleeding in intermittents, with our modern theories of fever?</P>
<P>MAY not the long continuance of an intermittent, by debilitating the &s;y&s;tem, produce &s;uch an irritability in the arteries, as to di&s;po&s;e them to that &s;pecies of inflammatory diathe&s;is which is founded on indirect debility? Or,</P>
<P>MAY not &s;uch conge&s;tions be formed in the vi&s;cera, as to produce the &s;ame &s;pecies of inflammatory diathe&s;is that occurs in &s;everal other inflammatory di&s;ea&s;es?</P>
<P>DOCTOR Cullen has taught us, in his account of the chronic hepatatis, that there may be topical affection and inflammatory diathe&s;is, without much pain or fever; and had I not witne&s;&s;ed &s;everal ca&s;es of this kind, I &s;hould have been forced to have believed it po&s;&s;ible, not only in this di&s;order, but in many others, from the facts which were communicated to me by Doctor Michaelis in his vi&s;it to Philadelphia in the year 1783.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="022123_0125_0FB6E73E37E00BF0">
I ONCE intended to have added to this account of the efficacy of bli&s;ters and bleeding in curing ob&s;tinate intermittents, te&s;timonies from a number of medical gentlemen, of the &s;ucce&s;s with which they have u&s;ed them; but the&s;e vouchers have become &s;o numerous, that they would &s;well this e&s;&s;ay far beyond the limits I wi&s;h to pre&s;cribe to it.</P>

<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF THE DISORDER OCCASIONED BY DRINKING COLD WATER IN WARM WEATHER, AND THE METHOD OF CURING IT.</HEAD>
<P>FEW &s;ummers elap&s;e in Philadelphia, in which there are not in&s;tances of many per&s;ons being affected by drinking cold water. In &s;ome &s;ea&s;ons four or five per&s;ons have died &s;uddenly from this cau&s;e, in one day. This mortality falls chiefly upon the la|bouring part of the community, who &s;eek to allay their thir&s;t by drinking the water from the pumps in the &s;treets, and who are too impatient, or too ignorant, to u&s;e the nece&s;&s;ary precautions for preventing its mor|bid or deadly effects upon them. The&s;e accidents &s;el|dom happen, except when the mercury ri&s;es above 85&deg; in Farenheit's thermometer.</P>
<P>THREE circum&s;tances generally concur to produce di&s;ea&s;e or death from drinking cold water. 1. The patient is extremely warm. 2. The water is extreme|ly cold. And, 3. A large quantity of it is taken in|to the body. The danger from drinking the cold wa|ter is always in proportion to the degrees of combi|nation which occur in the three circum&s;tances that have been mentioned.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="022123_0127_0FB6E7421829E1F0">
THE following &s;ymptoms generally follow, where cold water has been taken, under the above circum|&s;tances, into the body.</P>
<P>IN a few minutes after the patient has &s;wallowed the water, he is affected by a dimne&s;s of &s;ight, he &s;taggers in attempting to walk, and unle&s;s &s;upported, falls to the ground; he breathes with difficulty; a rat|tling is heard in his throat; his no&s;trils and cheeks expand and contract in every act of re&s;piration; his face appears &s;uffu&s;ed with blood, and of a livid color; his extremities become cold, and his pul&s;e impercep|tible; and unle&s;s relief is &s;peedily obtained, the di&s;|order terminates in death, in four or five minutes.</P>
<P>THIS de&s;cription includes only the le&s;s common ca&s;es of the effects of drinking a <HI>large</HI> quantity of <HI>cold</HI> water, when the body is <HI>preternaturally</HI> heated. More frequently, patients are &s;eized with acute &s;pa&s;ms in the brea&s;t and &s;tomach. The&s;e &s;pa&s;ms are &s;o painful as to produce &s;yncope, and even a&s;phyxi. They are &s;ome|times of the tonic, but more frequently of the clonic kind. In the intervals of the &s;pa&s;ms the patient ap|pears to be perfectly well. The intervals between each &s;pa&s;m become longer or &s;horter, according as the di&s;|ea&s;e tends to life or death.</P>
<P>IT may not be improper to take notice, that punch, beer, and even toddy, when drank under the &s;ame circum&s;tances as cold water, have all been known to produce the &s;ame morbid and fatal effects.</P>
<P>I KNOW of but one certain remedy for this di&s;ea&s;e, and that is LIQUID LAUDANUM. The do&s;es of it,
<PB N="131" REF="022123_0128_0FB6E747338D5B70">
as in other ca&s;es of &s;pa&s;m, &s;hould be proportioned to the violence of the di&s;ea&s;e. From a tea-&s;poonful to near a table-&s;poonful have been given in &s;ome in&s;tances, before relief has been obtained. Where the powers of life appear to be &s;uddenly &s;u&s;pended, the &s;ame re|medies &s;hould be u&s;ed, which have been &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully employed in recovering per&s;ons &s;uppo&s;ed to be dead from drowning.</P>
<P>CARE &s;hould be taken in every ca&s;e of di&s;ea&s;e, or apparent death, from drinking cold water, to pre|vent the patient's &s;uffering from being &s;urrounded, or even attended by too many people.</P>
<P>PERSONS who have been recovered from the im|mediate danger which attends this di&s;ea&s;e, are &s;ome|times affected after it, by inflammations and ob&s;truc|tions in the brea&s;t or liver. They generally yield to the u&s;ual remedies which are admini&s;tered in tho&s;e complaints, when they ari&s;e from other cau&s;es.</P>
<P>IF neither the voice of rea&s;on, nor the fatal ex|amples of tho&s;e who have peri&s;hed from this cau&s;e, are &s;ufficient to produce re&s;traint in drinking a <HI>large</HI> quantity of <HI>cold</HI> liquors, when the body is <HI>preternatu|rally</HI> heated, then let me advi&s;e to</P>
<P N="1">1. GRASP the ve&s;&s;el, out of which you are about to drink, for a minute or longer with both your hands. This will ab&s;tract a portion of heat from the body, and impart it at the &s;ame time to the cold liquor, provided the ve&s;&s;el is made of metal, gla&s;s, or earth; for heat follows the &s;ame laws, in many in&s;tances, in pa&s;&s;ing

By re|ceiving the &s;hock of the water fir&s;t upon tho&s;e parts of the body, a portion of its heat is conveyed away, and the vital parts are thereby defended from the ac|tion of the cold.</P>

<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF THE EFFICACY OF COMMON SALT, IN THE CURE OF Haemopty&s;is.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hed opinions and prac|tice re&s;pecting the cau&s;e and cure of haemopty&s;is, the la&s;t medicine that would occur to a regular-bred phy&s;ician for the cure of it, is COMMON SALT; and yet I have &s;een and heard of a great number of ca&s;es, in which it has been admini&s;tered with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>THE mode of giving it, is to pour down from a tea, to a table-&s;poonful of clean fine &s;alt, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible after the haemorrhage begins from the lungs. This quantity generally &s;tops it; but the do&s;e mu&s;t be repeated daily for three or four days, to prevent a re|turn of the di&s;order. If the bleeding continues, the &s;alt mu&s;t be continued till it is checked, but in larger do&s;es. I have heard of &s;everal in&s;tances in which two table-&s;poonfuls were taken at one time for &s;everal days.</P>
<P>IT &s;ometimes excites a &s;ickne&s;s at the &s;tomach, and never fails to produce a burning &s;en&s;ation in the throat in its pa&s;&s;age into the &s;tomach, and con&s;iderable thir&s;t afterwards.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="022123_0131_0FB6E74B48CFB8D8">
I HAVE found this remedy to &s;ucceed equally well in haemorrhages, whether they were active or pa&s;&s;ive, or whether they occurred in young or in old people.</P>
<P>I HAD pre&s;cribed it for &s;everal years before I could &s;atisfy my&s;elf with a theory, to account for its extra|ordinary action upon the human body. My inquiries led me to attend more particularly to the following facts.</P>
<P N="1">1. THOSE per&s;ons who have been early in&s;tructed in vocal mu&s;ic, and who u&s;e their vocal organs mo|derately through life, are &s;eldom affected by an hae|morrhage from the lungs.</P>
<P N="2">2. LAWYERS, players, public cryers, and city watchmen, all of whom exerci&s;e their lungs either by long or loud &s;peaking, are le&s;s affected by this di&s;or|der, than per&s;ons of other occupations.</P>
<P>I ACKNOWLEDGE I cannot extend this ob&s;ervati|on to the public teachers of religion. I have known &s;everal in&s;tances of their being affected by haemopty&s;is; but never but one in which the di&s;order came on in the pulpit, and that was in a per&s;on who had been recently cured of it. The ca&s;es which I have &s;een, have generally been brought on by catarrhs.</P>
<P>TO this di&s;order, the practice of &s;ome of our Ame|rican preachers di&s;po&s;es them in a peculiar manner; for it is very common with this cla&s;s of them, to ex|po&s;e them&s;elves to the cold or evening air immediate|ly after taking, what a celebrated and eloquent preach|er u&s;ed to call a <HI>pulpit &s;weat.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="135" REF="022123_0132_0FB6E753C6459B28">
3. THIS haemorrhage chiefly occurs in debilitated habits, or in per&s;ons afflicted by &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition to con&s;umption, as indicates a weak and relaxed &s;tate of the lungs.</P>
<P N="4">4. IT generally occurs when the lungs are in a pa&s;&s;ive &s;tate; as in &s;itting, walking, and more fre|quently in lying. Many of the ca&s;es that I have known, have occurred during <HI>&s;leep,</HI> in the middle of the night.</P>
<P>FROM the&s;e facts, is it not probable that the com|mon &s;alt, by acting primarily and with great force upon the throat, extends its &s;timulus to the bleeding ve&s;&s;el, and by giving it a tone, checks the further effu&s;ion of blood?</P>
<P>I SHALL only add to this conjecture the following ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P N="1">1. I HAVE never known the common &s;alt perform a cure, where the haemorrhage from the lungs has been a &s;ymptom of a con&s;umption. But even in this ca&s;e, it gives a certain temporary relief.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE exhibition of common &s;alt in the haemop|ty&s;is, &s;hould by no means &s;upercede the u&s;e of occa|&s;ional bleeding when indicated by plethora, nor of that diet which the &s;tate of the pul&s;e, or of the &s;tomach, may require.</P>
<P N="3">3. I HAVE given the common &s;alt in one ca&s;e with &s;ucce&s;s, in an haemorrhage from the &s;tomach, accom|panied by a vomiting; and have heard of &s;everal ca&s;es in which it has been &s;uppo&s;ed to have checked a
<PB N="136" REF="022123_0133_0FB6E757E99C5418">
di&s;charge of blood from the no&s;e and uterus, but I can &s;ay nothing further in its favor in the&s;e la&s;t hae|morrhages, from my own experience.</P>
<P>IT may perhaps &s;erve to le&s;&s;en the prejudices of phy&s;icians again&s;t adopting improvements in medicine, that are not recommended by the authority of colleges or univer&s;ities, to add, that we are indebted to an old woman, for the di&s;covery of the efficacy of common &s;alt in the cure of haemopty&s;is.</P>

A phy&s;ician, in like manner, &s;hould con&s;ider his obligations to his profe&s;&s;ion and &s;ociety as undi&s;charged, who has not attempted to le&s;|&s;en the number of incurable di&s;ea&s;es. This is my apo|logy for pre&s;uming to make the con&s;umption the &s;ub|ject of a medical inquiry.</P>
<P>PERHAPS I may &s;ugge&s;t an idea, or fact, that may awaken the ideas and facts which now lie u&s;ele&s;s in the memories or common-place books of other phy&s;icians; or I may direct their attention to &s;ome u&s;eful experi|ments upon this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>I SHALL begin my ob&s;ervations upon the con&s;ump|tion, by remarking,</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT it is unknown among the Indians in North-America.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="138" REF="022123_0135_0FB6E75D6AE13410">
2. IT is &s;carcely known by tho&s;e citizens of the United States, who live in the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> &s;tage of civilized life, and who have lately obtained the title of the <HI>fir&s;t &s;ettlers.</HI></P>
<P>THE principal occupations of the Indian con&s;i&s;t in war, fi&s;hing, and hunting. Tho&s;e of the fir&s;t &s;et|tler, are fi&s;hing, hunting, and the laborious employ|ments of &s;ubduing the earth, cutting down fore&s;ts, building a hou&s;e and barn, and by di&s;tant excur&s;ions in all kinds of weather, to mills and courts. All of which tend to excite and pre&s;erve in the &s;y&s;tem, &s;ome|thing like the Indian vigor of con&s;titution.</P>
<P N="3">3. IT is le&s;s common in country places than in ci|ties, and increa&s;es in both, with intemperance and &s;edentary modes of life.</P>
<P N="4">4. SHIP and hou&s;e carpenters, &s;miths, and all tho&s;e artificers, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s requires great exertions of &s;trength, in the <HI>open</HI> air in <HI>all</HI> &s;ea&s;ons of the year, are le&s;s &s;ubject to this di&s;order, than men who work un|der cover, and at occupations which do not require the con&s;tant action of their limbs.</P>
<P N="5">5. WOMEN who &s;it more than men, and who&s;e work is connected with le&s;s exertion, are mo&s;t &s;ub|ject to the con&s;umption.</P>
<P>FROM the&s;e facts it would &s;eem, that the mo&s;t pro|bable method of curing the con&s;umption, is to revive in the con&s;titution, by means of exerci&s;e or labor, that vigor which belongs to the Indians, or to mankind in their fir&s;t &s;tage of civilization.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="022123_0136_0FB6E7627182CE00">
THE efficacy of the&s;e means of curing con&s;umpti|on will appear, when we inquire into the relative merit of the &s;everal remedies which have been u&s;ed by phy&s;icians in this di&s;order.</P>
<P>I SHALL not produce among the&s;e remedies the nu|merous receipts for &s;yrups, bolu&s;&s;es, electuaries, de|coctions, infu&s;ions, pills, medicated waters, powders, draughts, mixtures, and diet-drinks, which have &s;o long and &s;o &s;teadily been u&s;ed in this di&s;ea&s;e; nor &s;hall I mention as a remedy, the be&s;t accomodated diet, &s;ubmitted to with the mo&s;t patient &s;elf-denial; for not one of them all without the aid of exerci&s;e has ever, I believe, cured a &s;ingle con&s;umption.</P>
<P N="1">1. SEA-VOYAGES have cured con&s;umptions; but it has been only when they have been &s;o long, or &s;o fre|quent, as to &s;ub&s;titute the long continuance of gentle, to violent degrees of exerci&s;e of a &s;horter duration.</P>
<P N="2">2. A CHANGE of CLIMATE has often been pre|&s;cribed for the cure of con&s;umptions, but I do not re|collect an in&s;tance of its having &s;ucceeded, except when it has been accompanied by exerci&s;e, as in tra|velling, or by &s;ome active laborious pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>DOCTOR Gordon of Madeira, a&s;cribes the inefficacy of the air of Madeira in the con&s;umption, in part to the difficulty patients find of u&s;ing exerci&s;e in carria|ges, or even on hor&s;eback, from the badne&s;s of the roads in that i&s;land.</P>
<P N="3">3. JOURNIES have often performed cures in the con&s;umption, but it has been chiefly when they have been long, and accompanied by difficulties which have
<PB N="140" REF="022123_0137_0FB6E763DC0CAA00">
rou&s;ed and invigorated the powers of the mind and body.</P>
<P N="4">4. VOMITS and NAUSEATING MEDICINES have been much celebrated for the cure of con&s;umptions. The&s;e, by procuring a temporary determination to the &s;urface of the body, &s;o far le&s;&s;en the pain and cough as to enable patients to u&s;e profitable exerci&s;e. Where this has not accompanied or &s;ucceeded the exhibition of vomits, I believe they have &s;eldom afforded any <HI>permanent</HI> relief.</P>
<P N="5">5. BLOOD-LETTING has often relieved con&s;ump|tions; but it has been only by removing the trouble|&s;ome &s;ymptoms of inflammatory diathe&s;is, and there|by enabling the patients to u&s;e exerci&s;e, or labor, with advantage.</P>
<P N="6">6. VEGETABLE BITTERS and &s;ome of the STI|MULATING GUMS have in &s;ome in&s;tances afforded relief in con&s;umptions; but they have done &s;o only in tho&s;e ca&s;es where there was great debility, accompani|ed by a total ab&s;ence of inflammatory diathe&s;is. They have mo&s;t probably acted by their tonic qualities as &s;ub&s;titutes for labor and exerci&s;e.</P>
<P N="7">7. A PLENTIFUL and REGULAR PERSPIRATION excited by means of a flannel &s;hirt worn next to the &s;kin, or by means of a &s;tove-room, or by a warm cli|mate, has in many in&s;tances <HI>prolonged</HI> life in con&s;ump|tive habits; but all the&s;e remedies have acted as palli|atives only, and thereby have enabled the con&s;ump|tive patients to enjoy the more beneficial effects of exerci&s;e.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="141" REF="022123_0138_0FB6E76554144628">
8. BLISTERS, SETONS, and ISSUES, by determin|ing the per&s;pirable matter from the lungs to the &s;ur|face of the body, le&s;&s;en pain and cough, and thereby prepare the &s;y&s;tem for the more &s;alutary effects of exerci&s;e.</P>
<P N="9">9. THE effects of SWINGING upon the pul&s;e and re&s;piration, leave us no room to doubt of its being a tonic remedy, and therefore a &s;afe and agreeable &s;ub|&s;titute for exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>FORM all the&s;e facts it is evident that the remedies for con&s;umptions mu&s;t be &s;ought for in tho&s;e <HI>exerci&s;es and employments which give the greate&s;t vigor to the con&s;titution.</HI> And here I am happy in being able to produce &s;everal facts which demon&s;trate the &s;afety and certainty of this method of cure.</P>
<P>DURING the late war, I &s;aw three in&s;tances of per&s;ons in confirmed con&s;umptions who were perfectly cured by the hard&s;hips of a military life. They had been my patients previou&s;ly to their entering into the army. Be&s;ides the&s;e, I have heard of four well atte&s;t|ed ca&s;es of &s;imilar recoveries from nearly the &s;ame re|medies. One of the&s;e was the &s;on of a farmer in New-Jer&s;ey, who was &s;ent to &s;ea as the la&s;t re&s;ource for a con&s;umption. Soon after he left the American &s;hore, he was taken by a Briti&s;h crui&s;er, and compel|led to &s;hare in all the duties and hard&s;hips of a common &s;ailor. After &s;erving in this capacity for twenty two months, he made his e&s;cape, and landed at Bo&s;ton, from whence he travelled on foot to his father's hou&s;e, (nearly four hundred miles) where he arrived in perfect health.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="022123_0139_0FB6E76D8CC9E148">
DOCTOR Way of Wilmington informed me, that a certain Abner Cloud, who was reduced &s;o low by a pulmonary con&s;umption as to be beyond all relief from medicine, was &s;o much relieved by &s;leeping in the open air, and by the u&s;ual toils of building a hut and improving a farm in the un&s;ettled parts of a new coun|ty in Penn&s;ylvania, that he thought him in a fair way of a perfect recovery.</P>
<P>DOCTOR Latimer of Wilmington, had been long afflicted with a cough and an occa&s;ional haemopty&s;is. He entered into the American army as a &s;urgeon, and &s;erved in that capacity till near the end of the war; during which time he was perfectly free from all pul|monic complaints. The &s;pitting of blood returned &s;oon after he &s;ettled in private practice. To remedy this complaint, he had recour&s;e to a low diet, but finding it ineffectual, he partook liberally of the u&s;ual diet of healthy men, and he now (as he lately inform|ed me) enjoys a good &s;hare of health.</P>
<P>IT would be very ea&s;y to add many other ca&s;es, in which labor, the employments of agriculture, and a life of hard&s;hip by &s;ea and land, have prevented, re|lieved, or cured not only the con&s;umption, but pul|monary di&s;ea&s;es of all kinds.</P>
<P>TO the ca&s;es that have been mentioned, I &s;hall add only one more, which was lately communicated to me by the venerable Doctor Franklin, who&s;e conver&s;ation at all times conveys in&s;truction, and not le&s;s in medi|cine than upon other &s;ubjects. In travelling, many years ago, through New-England, the doctor overtook the po&s;t-rider; and after &s;ome inquiries into the hi&s;|tory of his life, he informed him that he was bred a
<PB N="143" REF="022123_0140_0FB6E76E5BC89C20">
&s;hoemaker; that his confinement, and other circum|&s;tances, had brought on a con&s;umption, for which he was ordered by a phy&s;ician to ride on hor&s;eback. Finding this mode of exerci&s;e too expen&s;ive, he made intere&s;t, upon the death of an old po&s;t-rider, to &s;ucceed to his appointment, in which he perfectly recovered his health in two years. After this he returned to his old trade, upon which his con&s;umption returned. He again mounted his hor&s;e, and rode po&s;t in all &s;ea&s;ons and weathers, between New-York and Connecticut river, (about 140 miles); in which employment he continued upward of thirty years, in perfect health.</P>
<P>THESE facts, I hope, are &s;ufficient to e&s;tabli&s;h the advantages of re&s;toring the original vigor of the con|&s;titution, in every attempt to effect a radical cure of con&s;umption.</P>
<P>BUT how &s;hall the&s;e remedies be applied in the time of peace, or in a country where the want of woods, and brooks without bridges, forbid the attainment of the laborious plea&s;ures of the Indian mode of hunt|ing; or where the univer&s;al extent of civilization does not admit of our advi&s;ing the toils of a new &s;ettlement, and improvements upon <HI>bare</HI> creation? Under the&s;e circum&s;tances, I conceive &s;ub&s;titutes may be obtained for each of them, nearly of equal efficacy, and attain|able with much le&s;s trouble.</P>
<P N="1">1. DOCTOR Sydenham pronounced <HI>riding on hor&s;e|back,</HI> to be as certain a cure for con&s;umptions as bark is for an intermitting fever. I have no more doubt of the truth of this a&s;&s;ertion, than I have that inflamma|tory fevers are now le&s;s frequent in London, than they were in the time of Doctor Sydenham. If riding on
<PB N="144" REF="022123_0141_0FB6E76FD9A70440">

hor&s;eback in con&s;umptions has cea&s;ed to be a remedy in Britain, the fault is in the patient, and not in the remedy. <Q>It is a &s;ign that the &s;tomach requires milk, (&s;ays Doctor Cadogar,) when it cannot bear it.</Q> In like manner, the inability of the patient to bear this manly and whole&s;ome exerci&s;e, &s;erves only to demon|&s;trate the nece&s;&s;ity and advantages of it. I &s;u&s;pect the &s;ame objections to this exerci&s;e which have been made in Britain, will not occur in the United States of America; for the Americans, with re&s;pect to the &s;ymp|toms and degrees of epidemic and chronic di&s;ea&s;es, appear to be nearly in the &s;ame &s;tate that the inhabi|tants of England were in the &s;eventeenth century. I can ea&s;ily conceive the vigor of the human con&s;titu|tion to have been &s;uch in Doctor Sydenham's time, as that a defluxion or ulcer in the lungs &s;hould have had no more effect in increa&s;ing the action of the arterial &s;y&s;tem, than a moderate inflammation of the eyes has at pre&s;ent in exciting an inflammatory fever in a good con&s;titution: hence the &s;afety and advantage formerly of riding on hor&s;eback in pulmonic complaints. We find, in proportion to the decline of the vigor of the body, that many occa&s;ional cau&s;es produce fever and inflammation, which would not have done it an hun|dred years ago.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE laborious employments of agriculture, if &s;teadily pur&s;ued, and accompanied at the &s;ame time by the &s;imple, but whole&s;ome diet of a farm-hou&s;e, and a hard bed, would probably afford a good &s;ub&s;titute for the toils of a &s;avage or military life.</P>
<P N="3">3. SUCH occupations or profe&s;&s;ions as require con|&s;tant labor or exerci&s;e in the open air, in all kinds of weather, may ea&s;ily be cho&s;en for a young man who,
<PB N="145" REF="022123_0142_0FB6E771AD721FF0">
either from hereditary predi&s;po&s;ition, or an accidental affection of the lungs, is in danger of falling into a con&s;umption. In this we &s;hould imitate the advice given by &s;ome wi&s;e men, always to prefer tho&s;e pro|fe&s;&s;ions for our &s;ons which are the lea&s;t favourable to the corrupt inclinations of their hearts. For example, where an undue pa&s;&s;ion for money, or a crafty di&s;po&s;i|tion di&s;cover them&s;elves in early life, we are directed to oppo&s;e them by the le&s;s profitable and more di&s;inte|re&s;ted profe&s;&s;ions of divinity, or phy&s;ic, rather than cheri&s;h them by trade, or the practice of the law<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is very common for parents to prefer &s;edentary occupations for &s;uch of their children who are of delicate con&s;titutions, and the more active occupa|tions for tho&s;e of them who are robu&s;t. The <HI>rever&s;e</HI> of this practice &s;hould be followed. The weakly children &s;hould be trained to the laborious, and the robu&s;t to the &s;edentary occupations. From a neglect of this practice, many hundred apprentices to taylors, &s;hoemakers, conveyancers, watch|makers, &s;ilver&s;miths, mantuamakers, &amp;c. &amp;c. peri&s;h every year by con|&s;umptions.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="4">4. THERE is a ca&s;e recorded by Doctor Smollet, of the efficacy of the <HI>cold bath</HI> in a con&s;umption; and I have heard of its having been u&s;ed with &s;ucce&s;s in a negro man in one of the We&s;t-India i&s;lands. To ren|der this remedy u&s;eful, or even &s;afe, it will be nece&s;|&s;ary to join it with labor, or to u&s;e it in degrees that &s;hall prevent the alternation of the &s;y&s;tem with vigor and debility: for I take the cure of con&s;umption to depend upon the &s;imple action of tonic, without the lea&s;t mix|ture of debilitating powers. Indeed, I conceive it to be ea&s;ier to palliate the &s;ymptoms, and prolong life, by the u&s;e of the powers which are <HI>&s;imply debilitating,</HI> than by a mixture of both of them. This is not a &s;olitary fact in the human body. We often &s;ee a &s;tiff neck and &s;pa&s;ms, brought on by a per&s;on's being expo|&s;ed, at the &s;ame time, to a &s;tream of air from a door or
<PB N="146" REF="022123_0143_0FB6E7782AFEA338">
window, and to the heat of a warm room, where neither would have been injurious, if it had acted &s;ingly upon the &s;y&s;tem. There are many extremes in phy&s;ic, as in other things, which meet in a point. There is an inflammatory diathe&s;is connected with debility, as cer|tainly as with an exce&s;s of tone in the arterial &s;y&s;tem. And I think I have &s;een greater degrees of this inflam|matory diathe&s;is in the male inhabitants of cities, than of the country, and more in women, than in men. I have moreover &s;een the mo&s;t acute inflammatory di&s;ea|&s;es where the &s;y&s;tem had been previou&s;ly debilitated by a long continuance of warm weather, or of an ob&s;tinate intermitting fever, and in too many in&s;tances by the u&s;e of &s;pirituous liquors. This &s;pecies of inflammato|ry diathe&s;is appears to ari&s;e, therefore, from what has been called, and perhaps not improperly, <HI>indirect de|bility.</HI> Is it the pre&s;ence of this &s;pecies of inflammato|ry diathe&s;is which renders con&s;umptions &s;o much more difficult to cure than formerly? Is it <HI>this</HI> which often ren|ders riding on hor&s;eback &s;o ineffectual, or &s;o injurious in this di&s;order? I &s;u&s;pect it is; and it is to be lamen|ted that it often requires &s;o much time, or &s;uch reme|dies to remove this &s;pecies of inflammatory diathe&s;is, as to reduce the patient too low to make u&s;e of tho&s;e re|medies afterwards which would effect a radical cure.</P>
<P>IF it were po&s;&s;ible to graduate the tone of the &s;y&s;|tem by means of a &s;cale, I would add, that to cure con&s;umptions, the &s;y&s;tem &s;hould be rai&s;ed to the high|e&s;t degree of this &s;cale. Nothing &s;hort of an equili|brium of tone, or a free and vigorous action of every mu&s;cle and vi&s;cus in the body, will fully come up to a radical cure for con&s;umptions.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="022123_0144_0FB6E77B22782090">
IN regulating the diet of con&s;umptive patients, I conceive it to be as nece&s;&s;ary to feel the pul&s;e, as it is in determining when and in what quantity to draw blood. Where indirect inflammatory diathe&s;is pre|vails, a vegetable diet is certainly proper; but where the patient has <HI>e&s;caped,</HI> or <HI>pa&s;&s;ed</HI> this &s;tage of the di&s;|order, I believe a vegetable diet alone to be injurious; and am &s;ure a moderate quantity of animal food may be taken with advantage. In both ca&s;es, the diet &s;hould con&s;i&s;t, as much as po&s;&s;ible, of one kind of ali|ment.</P>
<P>THE pre&s;ence or ab&s;ence of this inflammatory dia|the&s;is, furni&s;hes the indications for admini&s;tering or re|fraining from the u&s;e of the bark and bal&s;amic medi|cines. With all the te&s;timonies of their having done mi&s;chief, many of which I could produce, I have known &s;everal ca&s;es in which they have been given with obvious advantage; but it was only when there was a total ab&s;ence of inflammatory diathe&s;is.</P>
<P>PERHAPS the remedies I have recommended, and the opinions I have delivered, may derive &s;ome &s;up|port from attending to the analogy of ulcers on the legs, and in other parts of the body. The fir&s;t of the&s;e occur chiefly in habits debilitated by &s;pirituous liquors, and the la&s;t frequently in habits debilitated by the &s;crophula. In curing the&s;e di&s;orders, it is in vain to depend upon internal or external medicines. The whole &s;y&s;tem mu&s;t be &s;trengthened, or we do nothing; and this is to be effected only by exerci&s;e and a gene|rous diet.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="022123_0145_0FB6E78282C6D890">
IN relating the facts that are contained in this e&s;&s;ay, I wi&s;h I could have avoided rea&s;oning upon them; e&s;pecially as I am confident of the certainty of the facts, and &s;omewhat doubtful of the truth of my rea|&s;onings.</P>
<P>I SHALL only add, that if the cure of con&s;umpti|ons &s;hould at la&s;t be effected by remedies in every re|&s;pect the oppo&s;ites of tho&s;e palliatives which are now fa&s;hionable and univer&s;al, no more will happen than what we have already &s;een in the tetanus, the &s;mall|pox, and in the management of fractured limbs.</P>
<P>SHOULD this be the ca&s;e, we &s;hall not be &s;urpri&s;ed to hear of phy&s;icians, in&s;tead of pre&s;cribing any one, or all of the medicines formerly enumerated for con|&s;umptions, ordering their patients to exchange the amu&s;ements or indolence of a city, for the toils of a country life; of their advi&s;ing farmers to exchange their plentiful tables, and comfortable fire-&s;ides, for the &s;canty but &s;olid &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and midnight expo|&s;ure of the herd&s;man; or of their recommending, not &s;o much the exerci&s;e of a <HI>pa&s;&s;ive</HI> &s;ea-voyage, as the <HI>active</HI> labors and dangers of a common &s;ailor. Nor &s;hould it &s;urpri&s;e us, after what we have &s;een, to hear patients relate the plea&s;ant adventures of their ex|cur&s;ions, or labors, in que&s;t of their recovery from this di&s;order, any more than it does now to &s;ee a &s;trong or well &s;haped limb that has been broken; or to hear a man talk of his &s;tudies, or plea&s;ures, during the time of his being inoculated and attended for the &s;mall|pox.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="022123_0146_0FB6E7838F69FBE0">
FROM a review of the facts and ob&s;ervations which have been mentioned, I cannot help thinking that the words of the philo&s;opher, "Quod petis in te e&s;t," ap|ply not more to the means of obtaining happine&s;s, than they do to the means of obtaining a radical cure for the con&s;umption.</P>
<P>I WILL not venture to a&s;&s;ert, that there does not exi&s;t a medicine, which &s;hall &s;upply, at lea&s;t in &s;ome degree, the place of the labor or exerci&s;es, who&s;e u&s;e|fulne&s;s in con&s;umptions has been e&s;tabli&s;hed by the facts that have been mentioned. Many in&s;tances of the analogous effects of medicines, and of exerci&s;e up|on the human body, forbid the &s;uppo&s;ition. I &s;hall only add, that if there does exi&s;t in nature &s;uch a me|dicine, I am di&s;po&s;ed to believe it will be found in the cla&s;s of TONICS. If this &s;hould be the ca&s;e, I con|ceive its &s;trength, or its do&s;e, mu&s;t far exceed the pre|&s;ent &s;tate of our knowledge or practice, with re&s;pect to the efficacy or do&s;e of tonic medicines.</P>
<P>I EXCEPT the di&s;order, which ari&s;es from recent ab&s;ce&s;&s;es in the lungs, from the general ob&s;ervation which has been made, re&s;pecting the inefficacy of the remedies that were formerly enumerated for the cure of con&s;umptions without labor or exerci&s;e. The&s;e ab&s;ce&s;&s;es often occur without being accompanied by a con&s;umptive diathe&s;is, and are frequently cured by nature, or by very &s;imple medicines.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS UPON WORMS IN THE ALIMENTARY CANAL, AND UPON ANTHELMINTIC MEDICINES.</HEAD>
<P>WITH great diffidence I venture to lay before the public my opinions upon worms: nor &s;hould I have pre&s;umed to do it, had I not enter|tained a hope of thereby exciting further inquiries upon this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>WHEN we con&s;ider how univer&s;ally worms are found in all young animals, and how frequently they exi&s;t in the human body, without producing di&s;ea&s;e of any kind, it is natural to conclude, that they &s;erve &s;ome u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary purpo&s;es in the animal oeco|nomy. Do they con&s;ume the &s;uperfluous aliment which all young animals are di&s;po&s;ed to take before they have been taught, by experience or rea&s;on, the bad con&s;equences which ari&s;e from it? It is no ob|jection to this opinion, that worms are unknown in the human body in &s;ome countries. The laws of na|ture are diver&s;ified, and often &s;u&s;pended under pecu|liar circum&s;tances in many ca&s;es, where the departure from uniformity is &s;till more unaccountable, than in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance.

IN many in&s;tances I have &s;een worms di&s;charged in the &s;mall-pox and mea&s;les, from children who were in perfect health previou&s;ly to their being attack|ed by tho&s;e di&s;orders, and who never before di&s;cover|ed a &s;ingle &s;ymptom of worms. I &s;hall &s;ay nothing here of the &s;warms of worms which are di&s;charged in fevers of all kinds, until I attempt to prove that an idiopathic fever is never produced by worms.</P>
<P N="2">2. NINE out of ten of the ca&s;es which I have &s;een of worms, have been in children of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t ha|bits and mo&s;t vigorous con&s;titutions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Since the above ob&s;ervations upon worms were committed to paper, I have met with the following facts, in a letter from Doctor Capelle of Wil|mington, which has been read in the College of Phy&s;icians of Philadelphia. In the livers of &s;ixteen, out of eighteen rats which he di&s;&s;ected, he informed me that he found a number of the taenia worms. The rats were fat, and ap|peared in other re&s;pects to have been in perfect health. The two rats in which he found no worms, he &s;ays, <Q>were very lean, and their livers &s;mall|er in proportion than the others.</Q></NOTE>. This is more e&s;pecially the ca&s;e where the worms are di&s;lodged by the &s;mall-pox and mea&s;les.</P>
<P N="3">3. IN weakly children, I have often known the mo&s;t powerful anthelmintics given without bringing away a &s;ingle worm. If the&s;e medicines have afford|ed any relief, it has been by their tonic quality. From this fact, is it not probable&mdash;The conjecture I am afraid is too bold&mdash;but I will ri&s;k it. Is it not proba|ble. I &s;ay, that children are &s;ometimes di&s;ordered from the want of worms? Perhaps the tonic medicines
<PB N="152" REF="022123_0149_0FB6E78AF043CDF0">
which have been mentioned, render the bowels a more quiet and comfortable a&s;ylum for them, and thereby provide the &s;y&s;tem with the means of obviating the effects of crapulas, to which all children are di&s;po&s;ed. It is in this way that nature, in many in&s;tances, cures evil by evil. I confine the &s;alutary office of worms only to that &s;pecies of them which is known by the name of the round worm, and which occurs mo&s;t frequently in children.</P>
<P>IS there any &s;uch di&s;ea&s;e as an idiopathic WORM-FEVER? The Indians in this country &s;ay there is not, and a&s;cribe the di&s;charge of worms to a fever, and not a fever to the worms<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the inquiry into the di&s;ea&s;es of the Indians, pag. 22.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BY adopting this opinion, I am aware that I contra|dict the ob&s;ervations of many eminent and re&s;pectable phy&s;icians.</P>
<P>DOCTOR Huxham de&s;cribes an epidemic pleuri&s;y, in the month of March in the year 1740, which he &s;uppo&s;es was produced by his patients feeding upon &s;ome corn that had been injured by the rain the Au|gu&s;t before<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vol. II. of this Epidemics, p. 56.</NOTE>. He likewi&s;e mentions that a number of people, and the&s;e too of the elderly &s;ort<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">p. 136.</NOTE>, were afflicted at one time with worms in the month of April in the year 1743.</P>
<P>LIEUTAUD gives an account of an epidemic worm-fever from Vel&s;chius, an Italian phy&s;ician<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Vol. I. p. 76.</NOTE>; and Sau|vages de&s;cribes, from Vandermonde, an epidemic dy&s;en|tery from worms, which yielded finally only to worm medicines<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Vol. II. p. 329.</NOTE>. Sir John Pringle, and Doctor Monro,
<PB N="153" REF="022123_0150_0FB6E78DCF689C50">
likewi&s;e frequently mention worms as accompanying the dy&s;entery and remitting fever, and recommend the u&s;e of calomel as an antidote to them.</P>
<P>I GRANT that worms appear more frequently in &s;ome epidemic di&s;ea&s;es than in others, and oftener in &s;ome years than in others. But may not the &s;ame heat, moi&s;ture and diet, which produced the di&s;ea&s;es, have produced the worms? And may not their di&s;|charge from the bowels have been occa&s;ioned in tho&s;e epidemics, as in the &s;mall-pox and mea&s;les, by the increa&s;ed heat of the body; by the want of nou|ri&s;hment; or by an anthelmintic quality being acci|dentally combined with &s;ome of the medicines that are u&s;ually given in fevers?</P>
<P>IN an&s;wer to this, we are told that we often &s;ee the cri&s;is of a fever brought on by the di&s;charge of worms from the bowels by means of a purge, or by an anthelmintic medicine. Whenever this is the ca&s;e, I believe it is occa&s;ioned by offending bile being di&s;|lodged by means of the purge at the &s;ame time with the worms, or by the anthelmintic medicine (if not a purge) having been given on, or near one of the u&s;ual critical days of the fever. What makes the lat|ter &s;uppo&s;ition probable is, that worms are &s;eldom &s;u|&s;pected in the beginning of fevers, and anthelmintic medicines &s;eldom given, till every other remedy has failed of &s;ucce&s;s; and this generally happens about the u&s;ual time in which fevers terminate in life or death.</P>
<P>IT is very remarkable, that &s;ince the di&s;covery and de&s;cription of the hydrocephalus internus, we hear and read much le&s;s than formerly, of worm-fevers. I &s;u&s;pect that di&s;order of the brain has laid the founda|tion for the principal part of the ca&s;es of worm-fevers
<PB N="154" REF="022123_0151_0FB6E793A7724440">
which are upon record in books of medicine. I grant that worms &s;ometimes increa&s;e the danger from fevers, and often confound the diagno&s;is and progno&s;is of them, by a number of new and analogous &s;ymptoms. But here we &s;ee nothing more than that complication of &s;ymptoms which often occurs in di&s;ea&s;es of a very different and oppo&s;ite nature. How often are we puzzled by hy&s;teric and hypochondriac &s;ymptoms in a fever; and yet what phy&s;ician ever thought of an hy|&s;teric or an hypochondriac fever?</P>
<P>HAVING rejected worms as the cau&s;e of fevers, I proceed to remark, that the di&s;ea&s;es mo&s;t commonly produced by them, belong to the cla&s;s of NEUROSES. And here I might add, that there is &s;carcely a di&s;ea&s;e, or a &s;ymptom of a di&s;ea&s;e, belonging to this cla&s;s, which is not produced by worms. It would be only publi&s;hing extracts from books, to de&s;cribe them.</P>
<P>THE <HI>chronic</HI> and <HI>nervous</HI> di&s;ea&s;es of children, which are &s;o numerous, and frequently fatal, are, I believe, mo&s;t commonly occa&s;ioned by worms. There is no great danger, therefore, of doing mi&s;chief by pre&s;crib|ing anthelmintic medicines in all our fir&s;t attempts to cure their chronic and nervous di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>I HAVE taken great pains to find out, whether the pre&s;ence of the different &s;pecies of worms might not be di&s;covered by certain peculiar &s;ymptoms; but all to no purpo&s;e. I once attended a girl of twelve years of age, in a fever, who di&s;charged four yards of a taenia, and who was &s;o far from having di&s;covered any peculiar &s;ymptom of this &s;pecies of worms, that &s;he had never complained of any other indi&s;po&s;ition, than now and then a &s;light pain in the &s;tomach, which often occurs in young girls from a &s;edentary life, or from errors in
<PB N="155" REF="022123_0152_0FB6E79509C2B7E0">
their diet. I beg leave to add further, that there is not a &s;ymptom which has been &s;aid to indicate the pre|&s;ence of worms of any kind, as the cau&s;e of a di&s;ea&s;e, that has not deceived me; and none oftener than the one that has been &s;o much depended upon, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the picking of the no&s;e. A di&s;charge of worms from the bowels, is, perhaps, the only &s;ymptom that is pathog|nomonic of their pre&s;ence in the inte&s;tines.</P>
<P>I SHALL now make a few remarks upon anthel|mintic remedies.</P>
<P>BUT I &s;hall fir&s;t give an account of &s;ome experi|ments which I made in the year 1771, upon the com|mon earth-worm, in order to a&s;certain the anthelmin|tic virtues of a variety of &s;ub&s;tances. I made choice of the earth-worm for this purpo&s;e, as it is, according to naturali&s;ts, exactly the &s;ame in its &s;tructure, man|ner of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and mode of propagating its &s;pecies, with the round worm of the human body.</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t column I &s;hall &s;et down, under di&s;|tinct heads, the &s;ub&s;tances in which worms were placed; and in the &s;econd and third columns the <HI>time</HI> of their death, from the action of the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances upon them.</P>

<P>IN order to derive any benefit from the&s;e experi|ments, as well as from the ob&s;ervations that have been
<PB N="158" REF="022123_0155_0FB6E79F44F98388">
made upon anthelmintic medicines, it will be nece&s;|&s;ary to divide them into &s;uch as act,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. MECHANICALLY,</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. CHEMICALLY upon worms; and,</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. INTO tho&s;e which po&s;&s;e&s;s a power compo&s;ed of chemical and mechanical qualities.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. THE mechanical medicines act indirectly and directly upon the worms.</P>
<P>THOSE which act <HI>indirectly</HI> are, vomits, purges, bitter and a&s;tringent &s;ub&s;tances, particularly aloes, rhubarb, bark, bears-foot, and worm-&s;eed. Sweet oil acts indirectly and very feebly upon worms. It was introduced into medicine from its efficacy in de&s;troy|ing the botts in hor&s;es; but the worms which infe&s;t the human bowels, are of a different nature, and po&s;|&s;e&s;s very different organs of life from tho&s;e which are found in the &s;tomach of an hor&s;e.</P>
<P>THOSE mechanical medicines which act <HI>directly</HI> upon the worms, are, cowhage<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dolichos Pruriens, of Linnaeus.</NOTE> and powder of tin. The la&s;t of the&s;e medicines has been &s;uppo&s;ed to act chemically upon the worms, from the ar&s;enic which adheres to it in its pure&s;t &s;tate; but from the length of time a worm lived in a &s;olution of white ar&s;enic, it is probable the tin acts altogether mechanically upon them.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE medicines which act chemically upon worms, appear, from our experiments, to be very numerous.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="022123_0156_0FB6E7A09C553838">
NATURE has wi&s;ely guarded children again&s;t the morbid effects of worms, by implanting in them an early appetite for common &s;alt, ripe fruits and &s;accha|rine &s;ub&s;tances; all which appear to be among the mo&s;t &s;peedy and effectual poi&s;ons for worms.</P>
<P>LET it not be &s;aid, that nature here counteracts her own purpo&s;es. Her conduct in this bu&s;ine&s;s is con|formable to many of her operations in the human body, as well as throughout all her works. The bile is a nece&s;&s;ary part of the animal fluids, and yet an ap|petite for ripe fruits &s;eems to be implanted chiefly to obviate the con&s;equences of its exce&s;s, or acrimony, in the &s;ummer and autumnal months.</P>
<P>THE u&s;e of common &s;alt as an anthelmintic medi|cine, is both ancient and univer&s;al. Cel&s;us recom|mends it. In Ireland it is a common practice to feed children, who are afflicted by worms, for a week or two upon a &s;alt &s;ea-weed, and when the bowels are well charged with it, to give a purge of wort in order to carry off the worms, after they are killed by the &s;alt diet.</P>

<P>EVER &s;ince I ob&s;erved the effects of &s;ugar and other &s;weet &s;ub&s;tances upon worms, I have recom|mended the liberal u&s;e of all of them in the diet of children, with the happie&s;t effects. The &s;weet &s;ub|&s;tances probably act in preventing the di&s;ea&s;es from worms in the &s;tomach only, into which they often in|&s;inuate

them&s;elves, e&s;pecially in the morning. When we wi&s;h to di&s;lodge worms from the bowels by &s;ugar or mela&s;&s;es, we mu&s;t give the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances in large quantities, &s;o that they may e&s;cape in part the action of the &s;tomach upon them.</P>
<P>I CAN &s;ay nothing from my own experience of the efficacy of the mineral &s;alts, compo&s;ed of copper, iron and zinc, combined with vitriolic acid, in de&s;troying worms in the bowels. Nor have I ever u&s;ed the corro&s;ive &s;ublimate in &s;mall do&s;es as an anthelmintic.</P>
<P>I HAVE heard well-atte&s;ted ca&s;es of the efficacy of the oil of turpentine in de&s;troying worms.</P>
<P>THE expre&s;&s;ed juices of onions and of garlic are very common remedies for worms. From one of the experiments it appears that the onion juice po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;trong anthelmintic virtues.</P>

<P>CALOMEL, in order to be effectual, mu&s;t be given in large do&s;es. It is a &s;afe and powerful anthelmin|tic. Combined with jalap, it often brings away worms when given for other purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>OF all the medicines that I have admini&s;tered, I know of none more &s;afe and certain than the &s;imple preparations of iron, whether they be given in the form of &s;teel-filings or of the ru&s;t of iron. If ever they fail of &s;ucce&s;s, it is becau&s;e they are given in too &s;mall do&s;es. I generally pre&s;cribe from five, to thirty grains every morning, to children between one year, and ten years old; and I have been taught by an old &s;ea-captain, who was cured of a taenia by this medicine, to give from two drachms to half an ounce of it, every morning, for three or four days, not only with &s;afety, but with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>I SHALL conclude this e&s;&s;ay with the following remarks.</P>
<P N="1">1. WHERE the action of medicines upon worms in the bowels, does not agree exactly with their action up|on the earth-worms in the experiments that have been
<PB N="162" REF="022123_0159_0FB6E7AFF38627B0">
related, it mu&s;t be a&s;cribed to the medicines being more or le&s;s altered by the action of the &s;tomach upon them. I conceive that the &s;uperior anthelmintic qua|lities of pink-root, &s;teel-filings, and calomel (all of which acted but &s;lowly upon the earth-worms compa|red with many other &s;ub&s;tances) are wholly occa&s;ioned by their e&s;caping the dige&s;tive powers unchanged, and acting in a concentrated &s;tate upon the worms.</P>
<P N="2">2. IN fevers attended with anomalous &s;ymptoms, which are &s;uppo&s;ed to ari&s;e from worms, I have con|&s;tantly refu&s;ed to yield to the &s;olicitations of my pa|tients, to abandon the indications of cure in the fe|ver, and to pur&s;ue worms as the <HI>principal</HI> cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e. While I have adhered &s;teadily to the u&s;ual remedies for the different genera and &s;pecies of fever, in all their &s;tages, I have at the &s;ame time blended tho&s;e remedies occa&s;ionally with anthelmentic medicines. In this I have imitated the practice of phy&s;icians in many other di&s;ea&s;es; in which trouble&s;ome and dan|gerous &s;ymptoms are pur&s;ued, without &s;educing the attention from the original di&s;order.</P>

<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF THE EXTERNAL USE OF ARSENIC IN THE CURE OF CANCERS. Read before the American Philo&s;ophical Society, February 3, 1786.</HEAD>
<P>A FEW years ago a certain Doctor Hugh Mar|tin, a &s;urgeon of one of the Penn&s;ylvania regi|ments &s;tationed at Pitt&s;burg, during the latter part of the late war, came to this city, and adverti&s;ed to cure cancers with a medicine which he &s;aid he had di&s;cover|ed in the woods, in the neighbourhood of the garri|&s;on. As Doctor Martin had once been my pupil, I took the liberty of waiting upon him, and a&s;ked him &s;ome que&s;tions re&s;pecting his di&s;covery. His an&s;wers were calculated to make me believe, that his medicine was of a vegetable nature, and that it was originally an Indian remedy. He &s;hewed me &s;ome of the me|dicine, which appeared to be the powder of a well-dried root of &s;ome kind. Anxious to &s;ee the &s;ucce&s;s of this medicine in cancerous &s;ores, I prevailed upon the doc|tor to admit me to &s;ee him apply it in two or three ca&s;es. I ob&s;erved in &s;ome in&s;tances, he applied a powder to the parts affected, and in others only touch|ed them with a feather dipped in a liquid which had a white &s;ediment, and which he made me believe was
<PB N="164" REF="022123_0161_0FB6E7B755457AF8">
the vegetable root diffu&s;ed in water. It gave me great plea&s;ure to witne&s;s the efficacy of the doctor's appli|cations. In &s;everal cancerous ulcers, the cures he performed were complete. Where the cancers were much connected with the lymphatic &s;y&s;tem, or accom|panied with a &s;crophulous habit of body, his medicine always failed, and, in &s;ome in&s;tances, did evident mi&s;|chief.</P>
<P>ANXIOUS to di&s;cover a medicine that promi&s;ed re|lief in even a few ca&s;es of cancers, and &s;uppo&s;ing that all the cau&s;tic vegetables were nearly alike, I applied the phytolacca or poke-root, the &s;tramonium, the arum, and one or two others, to foul ulcers, in hopes of &s;ee|ing the &s;ame effects from them which I had &s;een from Doctor Martin's powder; but in the&s;e I was di&s;ap|pointed. They gave &s;ome pain, but performed no cures. At length I was furni&s;hed by a gentleman from Pitt&s;burg with a powder which I had no doubt, from a variety of circum&s;tances, was of the &s;ame kind as that u&s;ed by Doctor Martin. I applied it to a fungous ulcer, but without producing the degrees of pain, in|flammation, or di&s;charge, which I had been accu&s;tom|ed to &s;ee from the application of Doctor Martin's powder. After this, I &s;hould have &s;u&s;pected that the powder was not a <HI>&s;imple</HI> root, had not the doctor con|tinued upon all occa&s;ions to a&s;&s;ure me, that it was wholly a vegetable preparation.</P>
<P>IN the beginning of the year 1784 the doctor died, and it was generally believed that his medicine had died with him. A few weeks after his death I procured, from one of his admini&s;trators, a few ounces of the doctor's powder, partly with a view of applying it to a cancerous &s;ore which then offered, and partly with
<PB N="165" REF="022123_0162_0FB6E7B89EC84790">
a view of examining it more minutely than I had been able to do during the doctor's life. Upon throwing the powder, which was of a brown color, upon a piece of white paper, I perceived di&s;tinctly a number of white particles &s;cattered through it. I &s;u&s;pected at fir&s;t that they were corro&s;ive &s;ublimate, but the u&s;ual te&s;ts of that metallic &s;alt &s;oon convinced me that I was mi&s;|taken. Recollecting that ar&s;enic was the ba&s;is of mo&s;t of the celebrated cancer powders that have been u&s;ed in the world, I had recour&s;e to the te&s;ts for detecting it. Upon &s;prinkling a &s;mall quantity of the powder upon &s;ome coals of fire, it emitted the garlic &s;mell &s;o perceptibly as to be known by &s;everal per&s;ons whom I called into the room where I made the experiment, and who knew nothing of the object of my inquiries. After this, with &s;ome difficulty I picked out about three or four grains of the white powder, and bound them between two pieces of copper, which I threw into the fire. After the copper pieces became red hot, I took them out of the fire, and when they had cooled, di&s;|covered an evident whitene&s;s imparted to both of them. One of the pieces afterwards looked like dull &s;ilver. The&s;e two te&s;ts have generally been thought &s;ufficient to di&s;tingui&s;h the pre&s;ence of ar&s;enic in any bodies; but I made u&s;e of a third, which has lately been com|municated to the world by Mr. Bergman, and which is &s;uppo&s;ed to be in all <HI>ca&s;es</HI> infallible.</P>
<P>I INFUSED a &s;mall quantity of the powder in a &s;o|lution of a vegetable alkali in water for a few hours, and then poured it upon a &s;olution of blue vitriol in water. The color of the vitriol was immediately changed to a beautiful green, and afterwards precipi|tated.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="022123_0163_0FB6E7BA11392E00">
I SHALL clo&s;e this paper with a few remarks upon this powder, and upon the cure of cancers and foul ulcers of all kinds.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE u&s;e of cau&s;tics in cancers and foul ulcers is very ancient, and univer&s;al. But I believe <HI>ar&s;enic</HI> to be the mo&s;t efficacious of any that has ever been u&s;ed. It is the ba&s;is of Plunket's and probably of Guy's well known cancer powders. The great art of applying it &s;ucce&s;sfully, is to dilute and mix it in &s;uch a manner as to mitigate the violence of its action. Doctor Mar|tin's compo&s;ition was happily calculated for this pur|po&s;e. It gave le&s;s pain than the common or lunar cau&s;tic. It excited a moderate inflammation, which &s;eparated the morbid from the &s;ound parts, and pro|moted a plentiful afflux of humors to the &s;ore during its application. It &s;eldom produced an e&s;car; hence it in&s;inuated it&s;elf into the deepe&s;t rece&s;&s;es of the can|cers, and frequently &s;eparated the&s;e fibres in an un|broken &s;tate which are generally called the roots of the cancer. Upon this account, I think, in an ulce|rated cancer it is to be preferred to the knife. It has no action upon the &s;ound &s;kin. This Doctor Hall proved by confining a &s;mall quantity of it upon his arm for many hours. In tho&s;e ca&s;es where Doctor Martin u&s;ed it to extract cancerous or &s;chirrous tumors that were not ulcerated, I have rea&s;on to believe that he always broke the &s;kin with Spani&s;h flies.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE ar&s;enic u&s;ed by the doctor was the pure white ar&s;enic. I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e from the examinati|on I made of the powder with the eye, that the pro|portion of ar&s;enic to the vegetable powder, could not be more than 1/40 part of the whole compound. I have rea&s;on to think that the doctor employed differ|ent
<PB N="167" REF="022123_0164_0FB6E7BC1C803808">
vegetable &s;ub&s;tances at different times. The vege|table matter with which the ar&s;enic was combined in the powder which I u&s;ed in my experiments, was pro|bably nothing more than the powder of the root and berries of the &s;olanum lethale, or deadly night&s;hade. As the principal, and perhaps the only de&s;ign of the vegetable addition was to blunt the activity of the ar&s;e|nic, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e that the &s;ame proportion of com|mon wheat flour as the doctor u&s;ed of his cau&s;tic vege|tables, would an&s;wer nearly the &s;ame purpo&s;e. In tho&s;e ca&s;es where the doctor applied a feather dipped in a liquid to the &s;ore of his patient, I have no doubt but his phial contained nothing but a weak &s;olution of ar&s;enic in water. This is no new method of applying ar&s;enic to foul ulcers. Doctor Way of Wilmington, has &s;poken in the highe&s;t terms to me of a wa&s;h for foulne&s;&s;es on the &s;kin, as well as old ulcers, prepared by boiling an ounce of white ar&s;enic in two quarts of water to three pints, and applying it once or twice a day.</P>
<P N="3">3. I MENTIONED formerly that Doctor Martin was often un&s;ucce&s;sful in the application of his powder. This was occa&s;ioned by his u&s;ing it indi&s;criminately in <HI>all</HI> ca&s;es. In &s;chirrous and cancerous tumors, the knife &s;hould always be preferred to the cau&s;tic. In cancerous ulcers attended with a &s;crophulous or a bad habit of body, &s;uch particularly as have their &s;eat in the neck, in the brea&s;ts of females, and in the axillary glands, it can only protract the patient's mi&s;ery. Mo&s;t of the cancerous &s;ores cured by Doctor Martin were &s;eated on the no&s;e, or cheeks, or upon the &s;ur|face or extremities of the body. It remains yet to di&s;cover a cure for cancers that taint the fluids, or in|fect the whole lymphatic &s;y&s;tem. This cure I appre|hend
<PB N="168" REF="022123_0165_0FB6E7C1D2F26EF0">
mu&s;t be &s;ought for in diet, or in the long u&s;e of &s;ome internal medicine.</P>
<P>TO pronounce a di&s;ea&s;e incurable, is often to ren|der it &s;o. The intermitting fever, if left to it&s;elf, would probably prove frequently, and perhaps more &s;peedily fatal than cancers. And as cancerous tumors and &s;ores are often neglected, or treated improperly by injudicious people, from an apprehen&s;ion that they are incurable, (to which the frequent advice of phy&s;i|cians "to let them alone," has no doubt contributed) perhaps the introduction of ar&s;enic into regular practice as a remedy for cancers, may invite to a more early application to phy&s;icians, and thereby prevent the de|plorable ca&s;es that have been mentioned, which are often rendered &s;o by delay or un&s;kilful management.</P>
<P N="4">4. IT is not in cancerous &s;ores only that Doctor Martin's powder has been found to do &s;ervice. In &s;ores of all kinds, and from a variety of cau&s;es, where they have been attended with fungous fle&s;h or callous edges, I have u&s;ed the doctor's powder with advantage.</P>
<P>I FLATTER my&s;elf that I &s;hall be excu&s;ed in giving this detail of a <HI>quack</HI> medicine, when the &s;ociety reflect that it was from the inventions and temerity of quacks, that phy&s;icians have derived &s;ome of their mo&s;t active and u&s;eful medicines.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS ON THE CAUSE AND CURE OF THE TETANUS. Read before the American Philo&s;ophical Society, March 17, 1786.</HEAD>
<P>DURING my attendance, as phy&s;ician-general, upon the military ho&s;pitals of the United States, in the cour&s;e of the late war, I met with &s;everal ca&s;es of the tetanus. I had frequently met with this di&s;order in private practice, and am &s;orry to &s;ay, that I never &s;ucceeded with the ordinary remedy of opium in any one ca&s;e that came under my care. I found it equally ineffectual in the army. Baffled in my expectations from a remedy that had been &s;o much celebrated, I be|gan to inve&s;tigate more particularly the nature of the di&s;order. I found it to be a di&s;order of warm climates, and warm &s;ea&s;ons. This led me to a&s;cribe it to relax|ation. I re&s;olved to attempt the cure of it by a &s;et of medicines in &s;ome mea&s;ure the oppo&s;ites of mo&s;t of the medicines that have been employed in that di&s;order. Soon after I adopted this re&s;olution, I was called to vi&s;it Col. John Stone, who was wounded through the foot at the battle of Germantown, on the 4th of Octo|ber 1777. He was in the third day of a tetanus. His &s;pa&s;ms were violent, and his pains &s;o exqui&s;ite that his cries were heard near a hundred yards from his quar|ters. His head was thrown a little backwards, and
<PB N="170" REF="022123_0167_0FB6E7C79D866538">
his jaw had become &s;tiff and contracted. He was un|der the care of a &s;kilful regimental &s;urgeon, who was pouring down opium in large quantities without effect.</P>
<P>DUTY and friend&s;hip both led me to do my utmo&s;t to &s;ave the life of this valuable officer. I immediately di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the opium, and gave him large quantities of wine and bark, to the amount of two or three ounces of the latter, and from a bottle to three pints of the former in the day. In a few hours I was delighted with their effects. His &s;pa&s;ms and pains were le&s;s fre|quent and violent, and he &s;lept for &s;everal hours, which he had not done for &s;everal days and nights before.</P>
<P>WITH the &s;ame indication in view, I applied a bli&s;ter between his &s;houlders, and rubbed in two or three ounces of mercurial ointment upon the out&s;ide of his throat. He continued to mend gradually under the operation of the&s;e medicines, &s;o that in ten days he was out of danger, although the &s;pa&s;m continued in his wounded foot for &s;everal weeks afterwards.</P>
<P>IN the &s;ummer of the year 1782, I was called to vi&s;it a &s;ervant girl of Mr. Alexander Todd, merchant of this city, who had brought on a tetanus by &s;leeping in the evening on a damp brick pavement, after a day in which the mercury in Farenheit's thermometer had &s;tood at near 90&deg;. The ca&s;e was nearly as violent and alarming as the one I have de&s;cribed. I treated her in the &s;ame manner, and with the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s. To the above named medicines, I added only the oil of amber, which &s;he took in large do&s;es, after I &s;u&s;|pected the tonic and &s;timulating powers of the bark and wine began to lo&s;e their effects. The good effects
<PB N="171" REF="022123_0168_0FB6E7CBB54A8078">
of the oil were very obvious. She recovered gradu|ally, and has continued ever &s;ince in good health.</P>
<P>IN the &s;ummer of the &s;ame year, I was called to Alexander Le&s;lie, a joiner, who had run a nail in his foot. I found him the day afterwards in extreme pain, with &s;mall convul&s;ions, and now and then a twinge in his jaw. The wound in his foot was without &s;well|ing or inflammation. I dilated the wound and filled it with lint moi&s;tened with &s;pirit of turpentine. This in a little while produced a good deal of pain and a great inflammation in his foot. While I was prepa|ring to treat him in the manner I had treated the two former ca&s;es, the pains and &s;pa&s;ms in his body &s;ud|denly left him, and in twenty-four hours after I &s;aw him, he complained of nothing but of the pain and &s;welling in his foot, which continued for &s;everal weeks, and did not leave him till it ended in a &s;uppuration. From the hi&s;tory of the&s;e three ca&s;es, I beg leave to make the following remarks.</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT the predi&s;po&s;ition to the tetanus depends upon relaxation. This relaxation is generally produ|ced by heat; but exce&s;&s;ive labor, watchings, marches, or fatigue from any cau&s;e, all produce it likewi&s;e; and hence we find it more frequent from wounds received in battles, than from &s;imilar wounds received in any other way. The&s;e wounds more certainly produce the tetanus, if they have been preceded for &s;ome time with warm weather. Doctor Shoepft, the phy|&s;ician-general of the An&s;pach troops who &s;erved at the &s;iege of York in the year 1781, informed me of a &s;ingular fact upon this &s;ubject. Upon conver&s;ing with the French &s;urgeons after the capitulation, he was informed by them that the troops who arrived ju&s;t
<PB N="172" REF="022123_0169_0FB6E7CDBA8B32A8">
before the &s;iege from the We&s;t-Indies with Count de Gra&s;&s;e, were the only troops belonging to their nation who &s;uffered from the tetanus. There was not a &s;in|gle in&s;tance of that di&s;order among the French troops who had &s;pent a winter in Rhode-I&s;land.</P>
<P N="2">2. As the tetanus &s;eems to be occa&s;ioned by relaxa|tion, the medicines indicated to cure it are &s;uch only as are calculated to remove this relaxation, and to re|&s;tore a tone to the &s;y&s;tem. The bark and wine ap|pear to act in this way. The operation of the bli&s;ters is of a more complicated nature. That they are &s;e|dative and anti&s;pa&s;modic in fevers is univer&s;ally ac|knowledged, but in the peculiar &s;tate of irritability which occurs in the tetanus, perhaps their effects are more &s;imply &s;timulating. But I will go one &s;tep fur|ther. In order to cure this di&s;order, it is nece&s;&s;ary not only to produce an ordinary tone in the &s;y&s;tem, but &s;omething like the inflammatory diathe&s;is. The ab&s;ence of this diathe&s;is is taken notice of by all authors, par|ticularly by Doctor Cullen.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fir&s;t Lines, Vol. III.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>MERCURY appears to act only by promoting this diathe&s;is. Hence it never does any &s;ervice unle&s;s it be given time enough to produce a &s;alivation. The irri|tation and inflammation produced in the mouth and throat, &s;eldom fail to produce the inflammatory dia|the&s;is, as blood drawn in a &s;alivation has repeatedly &s;hewn.</P>
<P>I APPREHEND that the oil of amber acts as a &s;ti|mulant chiefly in this di&s;order. I have heard of a te|tanus being cured in the i&s;land of Grenada by large do&s;es of mu&s;tard. Doctor Wright, lately of the
<PB N="173" REF="022123_0170_0FB6E7CF148F4E40">
i&s;land of Jamaica, relates in the &s;ixth volume of the London medical e&s;&s;ays, &s;everal remarkable ca&s;es of the tetanus being cured by the cold bath. Both the&s;e remedies certainly act as &s;timulants and tonics. By rea&s;oning <HI>&agrave; priori,</HI> I conceive that electricity would be found to be an equally powerful remedy in this di&s;order.</P>
<P>AS a general inflammatory diathe&s;is di&s;po&s;es to to|pical inflammation, &s;o topical inflammation di&s;po&s;es to general inflammatory diathe&s;is. Wounds upon this account are le&s;s apt to inflame in &s;ummer than in win|ter. In the tetanus, I have uniformly ob&s;erved an ab|&s;ence of all inflammation in the wounds or injuries that produced it. Doctor Stoll of Vienna has made the &s;ame ob&s;ervation.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pars tertia, rationis medendi, p. 423.</NOTE>. A &s;plinter under the nail produces no convul&s;ions, if pain, inflammation or &s;uppuration follow the accident. It is by exciting pain and inflammation, I apprehend, that the &s;pirit of turpentine acts in all wounds and punctures of nervous and tendinous parts. I have never known a &s;ingle in&s;tance of a tetanus from a wound, where this remedy had been applied in time. It was to excite an inflammation in the foot of Mr. Le&s;lie, that I dilated the wound and filled it with the &s;pirit of turpentine. I was not &s;urpri&s;ed at its good effects in this ca&s;e, for I was prepared to expect them.</P>
<P>I FIND a remarkable ca&s;e related in Doctor W. Monro's The&s;is, publi&s;hed in Edinburgh in the year 1783, of a black girl who had a tetanus from running a nail in her foot, being perfectly cured by deep and ex|ten&s;ive inci&s;ions being made in the wounded part by Doctor John Bell, of the i&s;land of Grenada.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="022123_0171_0FB6E7D09049C108">
IT is by producing inflammation in a particular part, and tone in the whole &s;y&s;tem, I apprehend, that the amputation of a wounded limb &s;ometimes cures a tetanus; and it is becau&s;e the degrees of both are too incon&s;iderable to oppo&s;e the violence of the &s;pa&s;ms in the advanced &s;tages of the tetanus, that amputation often fails of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>I HAVE been informed by a phy&s;ician who re&s;ided &s;ome time at St. Croix, that the negroes on that i&s;land always apply a pla&s;ter made of equal parts of &s;alt and tallow to their fre&s;h wounds, in order to prevent a locked jaw. The &s;alt always produces &s;ome degree of inflammation.</P>
<P>IF the facts that have been &s;tated are true, and the inferences that have been drawn from them are ju&s;t, how &s;hall we account for the action of the opium in curing this di&s;order? I do not deny its good effects in many ca&s;es, but I believe it has failed in four ca&s;es out of five in the hands of mo&s;t practitioners. It is remarkable that it &s;ucceeds only where it is given in very large do&s;es. In tho&s;e ca&s;es I would &s;uppo&s;e that its &s;edative powers are lo&s;t in its &s;timulating. It is upon a footing, therefore, in one re&s;pect, with the &s;timulating medicines that have been mentioned; but from its being combined with a &s;edative quality, it is probably inferior to mo&s;t of them. I am the more inclined to adopt this opinion, from an account I once received from Doctor Robert, of the i&s;land of Domi|nique, who informed me, that after having cured a negro man of a tetanus with large do&s;es of opium, he was afterwards &s;eized with a di&s;order in his &s;tomach, of which he died in a few days. Upon opening him, he found his &s;tomach inflamed and mortified. I do not
<PB N="175" REF="022123_0172_0FB6E7D4AECE7BA0">
forbid the u&s;e of opium altogether in this di&s;order. I think &s;mall do&s;es of it may be given to ca&s;e pain, as in other &s;pa&s;modic di&s;orders; but as its qualities are complicated, and its efficacy doubtful, I think it ought to yield to more &s;imple and more powerful remedies.</P>
<P>TO the ca&s;es that have been mentioned, I could add many others, in which I have rea&s;on to believe that the excitement of a topical inflammation by artifi|cial means, has effectually prevented a tetanus.</P>
<P>TO this account of the tetanus, I beg leave to &s;ub|join a few words upon a di&s;order commonly called the jaw-fall in infants, or the tri&s;mus na&s;centium of Doc|tor Cullen, which is nothing but a &s;pecies of tetanus.</P>
<P>I HAVE met with three ca&s;es of it in this city, all of which proved fatal. The &s;tage of the di&s;order in which I was con&s;ulted, and the age and weakne&s;s of the infants, forbad me to attempt any thing for their relief. I have introduced the &s;ubject of this di&s;order in children, only for the &s;ake of mentioning a fact com|municated to me by the late Doctor Cadwalader Evans of this city. This gentleman practi&s;ed phy&s;ic for &s;e|veral years in Jamaica, where he had frequent oppor|tunities of &s;eeing the tetanus in the black children. He found it in every ca&s;e to be incurable. He &s;uppo&s;ed it to be connected with the retention of the meconium in the bowels. This led him invariably to purge every child that was born upon the e&s;tates committed to his care. After he adopted this practice, he ne|ver met with a &s;ingle in&s;tance of the tetanus among children.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="022123_0173_0FB6E7D68CAB54F8">
PERHAPS it may tend to enlarge our ideas of the te|tanus, and to promote a &s;pirit of inquiry and experi|ment, to add, that this di&s;order is not confined to the human &s;pecies. I have known &s;everal in&s;tances of it in hor&s;es, from nails running in their feet, and other accidents. It is attended with a rigidity of the mu&s;|cles of the neck, a &s;tiffne&s;s in the limbs, and &s;uch a contraction of the jaw as to prevent their eating. It is generally fatal. In two ca&s;es I had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing the di&s;ea&s;e perfectly cured by applying a poten|tial cau&s;tic to the neck under the mane, by large do&s;es of oil of amber, and by plunging one of them into the river, and throwing buckets of cold water upon the other.</P>
<P>HOW far the rea&s;onings contained in this paper may apply to the hydrophobia, I cannot determine, having had no opportunity of &s;eeing the di&s;ea&s;e &s;ince I adopted the&s;e principles; but from the &s;pa&s;modic nature of the di&s;order, from the &s;ea&s;on of the year in which it generally occurs, and above all, from the ca&s;e related by Doctor Fothergill, of a young woman having e&s;caped the effects of the bite of a mad cat by means of the wound being kept open, (which from its &s;everity was probably connected with &s;ome degrees of inflammation) is it not probable that the &s;ame reme|dies, which have been u&s;ed with &s;ucce&s;s in the tetanus, may be u&s;ed with advantage in the hydrophobia? In a di&s;ea&s;e &s;o deplorable, and hitherto &s;o un&s;ucce&s;sfully treated, even a conjecture may lead to u&s;eful experi|ments and inquiries.</P>

<HEAD>Additional Ob&s;ervations UPON THE Tetanus and Hydrophobia.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE the publication of the foregoing ob&s;erva|tions, in the &s;econd volume of the American Philo&s;ophical tran&s;actions, I have received letters from &s;everal phy&s;icians in America, and one from Doctor James Currie of Liverpool, in Great-Britain; in each of which are contained ca&s;es that confirm the efficacy of tonic remedies, more e&s;pecially of <HI>wine</HI> and the <HI>cold bath,</HI> in the cure of tetanus. My own experience has furni&s;hed two new ca&s;es, in addition to tho&s;e which are publi&s;hed, in favor of the fir&s;t of tho&s;e remedies, joined with mercury. I am, notwith|&s;tanding, obliged to own, that the method of cure above mentioned has failed, in &s;ome in&s;tances, in the hands of &s;everal re&s;pectable practitioners in Philadel|phia; but I have rea&s;on to believe it was only where it was not u&s;ed in the fir&s;t &s;tage of the di&s;order, or where every po&s;&s;ible advantage has not been taken of the combined powers of all of the tonic remedies that have been mentioned.</P>
<P>THE Rev. Dr. Henry Muhlenberg, principal of the German college in Lanca&s;ter, informed me in the month of June 1787, that he had often met with the tri&s;mus na&s;centium among the children of poor peo|ple

belonging to his congregation. After reading the account of Doctor Evans's &s;ucce&s;sful method of pre|venting that di&s;order in Jamaica, by means of gentle purges, he recommended that practice to the parents of children where he &s;u&s;pected the di&s;ea&s;e might take place, and always with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>THE more I have con&s;idered the cau&s;es and &s;ymp|toms of hydrophobia, the more I am di&s;po&s;ed to a&s;cribe it to the &s;ame proximate cau&s;e as the tetanus. 1. They both affect the mu&s;cles of deglutition. I have lately &s;een a tetanus brought on by a fractured leg, in which an attempt to &s;wallow the &s;malle&s;t quantity of any li|quid, produced the &s;ame &s;udden and general convul|&s;ions which occur in the hydrophobia. 2. They both proceed from cau&s;es which appear to be related to each other, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> from wounds, and from the action of cold after the body has been previou&s;ly weakened by heat and exerci&s;e. Of the la&s;t, we have a remarkable proof in an account of a &s;pontaneous hydrophobia, publi&s;h|ed by Mr. Arthaud, pre&s;ident of the circle of Phila|delphians at Cape Francois, in the fir&s;t volume of the tran&s;actions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Recherches, memories, et ob&s;ervations &s;ur les maladies epizootiques, de Saint Domingue, p. 220.</NOTE> of that new and enterprizing &s;ociety. 3. They both &s;ometimes appear as &s;ymptoms of the &s;ame idiopathic di&s;order, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the hy&s;teria. 4. They both yield to the &s;ame remedies, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> to the excite|ment of an inflammation in the wounded part of the body, or to a long continued di&s;charge of matter from it, and to mercury. Of the efficacy of each of the&s;e remedies, there are proofs, not only in Mr. Arthaud's ob&s;ervations upon the hydrophobia, before mentioned, but in Van&s;wieten's commentaries upon Boerhaave's aphori&s;ms.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Aphori&s;m <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">143, N^o 1.</NOTE>.</P>

TO the&s;e facts I &s;hall add one more, which may &s;erve &s;till further to e&s;tabli&s;h the &s;amene&s;s of the indi|cations of cure in the tetanus and hydrophobia. In the London medical journal for the months of April, May, and June, 1784, I find the following account publi&s;hed by Doctor De Mathiis, phy&s;ician to the king of Naples' army. <Q>During his re&s;idence in Calabria, (the doctor tells us) that having one day caught a viper in the fields, he had occa&s;ion in his way home to pa&s;s by a farm-yard, where he &s;aw a dog chain|ed that was &s;aid to be mad. He offered water to this dog, upon which he immediately fell into con|vul&s;ions. Recollecting his viper, he was tempted to try its effects by applying it to the dog's throat. This was accordingly done, and the con&s;equences were, the head of the dog &s;welled, the &s;ymptoms of the hydrophobia cea&s;ed, and the animal recovered.</Q></P>
<P>IF more facts &s;hould occur, which &s;hall &s;hew the relation that the tetanus and hydrophobia have to each other, perhaps we may be led to conclude, that the wound inflicted by the teeth of a dog &s;ometimes acts in the &s;ame manner in producing hydrophobia, that wounds made by a nail, or any obtu&s;e lacerating in|&s;trument act, in producing tetanus; and that both di&s;|ea&s;es may be prevented, or cured, with equal certain|ty by the &s;ame tonic remedies.</P>

<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF THE INFLUENCE OF THE MILITARY AND POLITICAL EVENTS OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION UPON THE HUMAN BODY.</HEAD>
<P>THERE were &s;everal circum&s;tances peculiar to the American revolution, which &s;hould be men|tioned previou&s;ly to an account of the influence of the events which accompanied it, upon the human body.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE revolution intere&s;ted every inhabitant of the country of both &s;exes, and of every rank and age that was capable of reflection. An indifferent, or neutral &s;pectator of the controver&s;y, was &s;carcely to be found in any of the &s;tates.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE &s;cenes of war and government which it introduced, were new to the greate&s;t part of the inha|bitants of the United States, and operated with all the force of <HI>novelty</HI> upon the human mind.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE controver&s;y was conceived to be the mo&s;t important of any that had ever engaged the attention of mankind. It was generally believed by the friends of the revolution, that the very exi&s;tence of <HI>freedom</HI> upon our globe, was involved in the i&s;&s;ue of the con|te&s;t in favor of the United States.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="187" REF="022123_0184_0FB6E7F30F8E2D80">
4. THE American revolution included in it the cares of government, as well as the toils and dangers of war. The American mind was, therefore, frequent|ly occupied at the <HI>&s;ame time,</HI> by the difficult and com|plicated duties of political and military life.</P>
<P N="5">5. THE revolution was conducted by men who had been born <HI>free,</HI> and who&s;e &s;en&s;e of the ble&s;&s;ings of liberty was of cour&s;e more exqui&s;ite than if they had ju&s;t emerged from a &s;tate of &s;lavery.</P>
<P N="6">6. THE greate&s;t part of the &s;oldiers in the armies of the United States had family connections and pro|perty in the country.</P>

The re&s;entments of the Americans of cour&s;e ro&s;e, as is u&s;ual in all di&s;putes, in proportion to the number, and force of the&s;e ancient bonds of affection and union.</P>
<P N="8">8. A PREDILECTION to a limited monarchy, as an e&s;&s;ential part of a free and &s;afe government, and an attachment to the reigning king of Great-Britain, (with a very few exceptions) were univer&s;al in every part of the United States.</P>
<P N="9">9. THERE was at one time a &s;udden di&s;&s;olution of civil government in <HI>all,</HI> and of eccle&s;ia&s;tical e&s;tabli&s;h|ments in &s;everal of the &s;tates.</P>

FROM the action of each of the&s;e cau&s;es, and fre|quently from their combination in the &s;ame per&s;ons, effects might rea&s;onably be expected, both upon the mind and body, which have &s;eldom occurred; or if they have, I believe were never fully recorded in any age or country.</P>
<P>IT might afford &s;ome u&s;eful in&s;truction, to point out the influence of the military and political events of the revolution upon the under&s;tandings, pa&s;&s;ions, and mo|rals of the citizens of the United States; but my bu&s;i|ne&s;s in the pre&s;ent inquiry, is only to take notice of the influence of the&s;e events upon the human body, through the medium of the mind.</P>
<P>I SHALL fir&s;t mention the effects of the military, and &s;econdly, of the political events of the revolution. The la&s;t mu&s;t be con&s;idered in a two-fold view, ac|cordingly as they affected the friends or the enemies of the revolution.</P>
<P>I. IN treating of the effects of the military events, I &s;hall take notice, fir&s;t, of the influence of <HI>actual</HI> war, and, &s;econdly, of the influence of the military life.</P>
<P>IN the beginning of a battle, I have ob&s;erved <HI>thir&s;t</HI> to be a very common &s;en&s;ation among both officers and &s;oldiers. It occurred where no exerci&s;e or action of the body could have excited it.</P>
<P>MANY officers have informed me, that after the fir&s;t on&s;et in a battle, they felt a glow of heat, &s;o uni|ver&s;al as to be perceptible in both their ears.

THE American army furni&s;hed an in&s;tance of the effects of victory upon the human mind, which may &s;erve to e&s;tabli&s;h the inferences from the facts related by Doctor Blane. The Philadelphia militia who join|ed the remains of General Wa&s;hington's army in De|cember 1776, and &s;hared with them a few days after|wards in the capture of a large body of He&s;&s;ians at Trenton, con&s;i&s;ted of 1500 men, mo&s;t of whom had been accu&s;tomed to the habits of a city life. The&s;e men &s;lept in tents and barns, and &s;ometimes in the open air during the u&s;ual colds of December and Ja|nuary; and yet there were only two in&s;tances of &s;ick|ne&s;s, and only one of death, in that body of men in the cour&s;e of near &s;ix weeks, in tho&s;e winter months. This extraordinary healthine&s;s of &s;o great a number of men under &s;uch trying circum&s;tances, can only be a&s;cribed to the vigor infu&s;ed into the human body by the victory of Trenton having produced in&s;en&s;ibility to all the u&s;ual remote cau&s;es of di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>MILITIA officers and &s;oldiers, who enjoyed good health during a campaign, were often affected by fevers and other di&s;orders, as &s;oon as they returned to their re&s;pective homes. I knew one in&s;tance of a militia captain, who was &s;eized with convul&s;ions the fir&s;t night he lay on a feather bed, after &s;leeping &s;everal months on a matra&s;s, or upon the ground. The&s;e affections of the body appeared to be produced only by the &s;ud|den ab&s;traction of that tone in the &s;y&s;tem which was ex|cited by a &s;en&s;e of danger, and the other invigorating objects of a military life.</P>
<P>THE NOSTALGIA of Doctor Cullen, or the <HI>home|&s;ickne&s;s,</HI> was a frequent di&s;ea&s;e in the American army, more e&s;pecially among the &s;oldiers of the New-England

&s;tates. But this di&s;ea&s;e was &s;u&s;pended by the &s;uperior action of the mind under the influence of the princi|ples which governed common &s;oldiers in the American army. Of this General Gates furni&s;hed me with a re|markable in&s;tance in 1776, &s;oon after his return from the command of a large body of regular troops and militia at Ticonderoga. From the effects of the no&s;|talgia, and the feeblene&s;s of the di&s;cipline, which was exerci&s;ed over the militia, de&s;ertions were very fre|quent and numerous in his army, in the latter part of the campaign; and yet during the <HI>three weeks</HI> in which the general expected every hour an attack to be made upon him by General Burgoyne, there was not a &s;ingle de&s;ertion from his army, which con&s;i&s;ted at that time of 10,000 men.</P>
<P>THE patience, firmne&s;s, and magnanimity with which the officers and &s;oldiers of the American army endured the complicated evils of hunger, cold, and na|kedne&s;s, can only be a&s;cribed to an in&s;en&s;ibility of body, produced by an uncommon tone of mind excited by the love of liberty and their country.</P>
<P>BEFORE I proceed to the &s;econd general divi&s;ion of this &s;ubject, I &s;hall take notice, that more in&s;tances of apoplexies occurred in the city of Philadelphia, in the winter of 1774, 5, than had been known in for|mer years. I &s;hould have he&s;itated in recording this fact, had I not found the ob&s;ervation &s;upported by a fact of the &s;ame kind, and produced by a nearly &s;imi|lar cau&s;e, in the appendix to the practical works of Doctor Baglivi, profe&s;&s;or of phy&s;ic and anatomy at Rome. After a very wet &s;ea&s;on in the winter of 1694, 5, he informs us, that <Q>apoplexies di&s;played their rage; and perhaps (adds our author) that &s;ome part of this

epidemic illne&s;s was owing to the univer&s;al grief and dome&s;tic care, occa&s;ioned by all Europe being en|gaged in a war. All commerce was di&s;turbed, and all the avenues of peace blocked up, &s;o that the &s;tronge&s;t heart could &s;carcely bear the thoughts of it.</Q> The winter of 1774, 5, was a period of un|common anxiety among the citizens of America. Every countenance wore the marks of painful &s;olici|tude, for the event of a petition to the throne of Bri|tain, which was to determine whether reconciliation, or a civil war, with all its terrible and de&s;troying con|&s;equences, were to take place. The apoplectic fit, which deprived the world of the talents and virtues of the Honorable Peyton Randolph, <ABBR>E&s;q.</ABBR> while he filled the chair of congre&s;s in 1775, appeared to be occa&s;i|oned by the pre&s;&s;ure of the uncertainty of tho&s;e great events upon his mind. To the name of this illu&s;trious patriot, &s;everal others might be added, who were af|fected by the apoplexy in the &s;ame memorable year. At this time, a difference of opinion upon the &s;ubject of the conte&s;t with Great-Britain, had &s;carcely taken place among the citizens of America.</P>
<P>II. THE political events of the revolution produ|ced different effects upon the human body, through the medium of the mind, accordingly as they acted up|on the friends or enemies of the revolution.</P>
<P>I SHALL fir&s;t de&s;cribe its effects upon the former cla&s;s of citizens of the United States.</P>
<P>MANY per&s;ons of infirm and delicate habits, were re&s;tored to perfect health, by the change of place, or occupation, to which the war expo&s;ed them. This was the ca&s;e in a more e&s;pecial manner with hy&s;terical

women, who were much intere&s;ted in the &s;ucce&s;sful i&s;&s;ue of the conte&s;t. The &s;ame effects of a civil war upon the hy&s;teria, were ob&s;erved by Doctor Cullen in Scotland, in the years 1745 and 1746. It may per|haps help to extend our ideas of the influence of the pa&s;&s;ions upon di&s;ea&s;es, to add, that when either love, jealou&s;y, grief, or even devotion, wholly engro&s;s the female mind, they &s;eldom fail, in like manner, to cure, or to &s;u&s;pend hy&s;terical complaints.</P>
<P>THE population in the United States was more ra|pid from births during the war, than it had ever been in the &s;ame number of years &s;ince the &s;ettlement of the country.</P>
<P>I AM di&s;po&s;ed to a&s;cribe this increa&s;e of births <HI>chief|ly</HI> to the quantity and exten&s;ive circulation of money, and to the facility of procuring the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence during the war, which favoured marriages among the labouring part of the people<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wheat, which was &s;old before the war for &s;even &s;hillings and &s;ixpence, was &s;old for &s;everal years <HI>during</HI> the war for four, and in &s;ome places for two and &s;ixpence, Penn&s;ylvania currency per bu&s;hel. Beggars of every de&s;cripti|on di&s;appeared in the year 1776, and were &s;eldom &s;een till near the clo&s;e of the war.</NOTE>. But I have &s;uffi|cient documents to prove, that marriages were more fruitful than in former years, and that a con&s;iderable number of unfruitful marriages became fruitful during the war. In 1783, the year of the peace, there were &s;everal children born of parents who had lived many years together without i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>Mr. Hume informs us, in his hi&s;tory of England, that &s;ome old people, upon hearing the news of the re|&s;toration of Charles the IId, died &s;uddenly of joy. There was a time when I doubted the truth of this a&s;|&s;ertion;
<PB N="194" REF="022123_0191_0FB6E81056ACCB58">
but I am now di&s;po&s;ed to believe it, from hav|ing heard of a &s;imilar effect from an agreeable poli|tical event, in the cour&s;e of the American revolution. The door-keeper of congre&s;s, an aged man, died &s;ud|denly, immediately after hearing of the capture of Lord Cornwallis's army. His death was univer&s;ally a&s;cribed to a violent emotion of political joy. This &s;pecies of joy appears to be one of the &s;tronge&s;t emo|tions that can agitate the human mind.</P>
<P>PERHAPS the influence of that ardor in trade and &s;peculation, which &s;eized many of the friends of the revolution, and which was excited by the fallacious nominal amount of the paper money, &s;hould rather be con&s;idered as a di&s;ea&s;e than as a pa&s;&s;ion. It unhinged the judgement, depo&s;ed the moral faculty, and filled the imagination, in many people, with airy and imprac|ticable &s;chemes of wealth and grandeur. De&s;ultory manners, and a peculiar &s;pecies of extempore conduct, were among its characteri&s;tic &s;ymptoms. It produced in&s;en&s;ibility to cold, hunger, and danger. The trading towns, and in &s;ome in&s;tances the extremities of the Unit|ed States, were frequently vi&s;ited in a few hours or days by per&s;ons affected by this di&s;ea&s;e; and hence "to tra|vel with the &s;peed of a &s;peculator" became a common &s;aying in many parts of the country. This &s;pecies of in&s;anity (if I may be allowed to call it by that name) did not require the confinement of a bedlam to cure it, like the &s;outh-&s;ea madne&s;s de&s;cribed by Doctor Mead. Its remedies were the depreciation of the paper money, and the events of the peace.</P>
<P>THE political events of the revolution produced up|on its enemies very different effects from tho&s;e which have been mentioned.</P>

The cau&s;es which produced the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, may be reduced to four heads. 1. The lo&s;s of former power or influence in government. 2. The de&s;truction of the hierarchy of the Engli&s;h church in America. 3. The change in the habits of diet, company and manners, produced by the annihilation of ju&s;t debts by means of depreciated pa|per money. And, 4. The neglect, in&s;ults, and op|pre&s;&s;ion, to which the loyali&s;ts were expo&s;ed, from individuals, and in &s;everal in&s;tances, from the laws of &s;ome of the &s;tates.</P>

THE termination of the war by the peace in 1783, did not terminate the American revolution. The minds of the citizens of the United States were wholly unprepared for their new &s;ituation. The exce&s;s of the pa&s;&s;ion for liberty, inflamed by the &s;ucce&s;sful i&s;&s;ue of the war, produced, in many people, opinions and conduct which could not be removed by rea&s;on, nor re&s;trained by government. For a while, they threat|ened to render abortive the goodne&s;s of heaven to the United States, in delivering them from the evils of &s;lavery and war. The exten&s;ive influence which the&s;e opinions had upon the under&s;tandings, pa&s;&s;ions, and morals of many of the citizens of the United States, con&s;tituted a &s;pecies of in&s;anity, which I &s;hall take the liberty of di&s;tingui&s;hing by the name of <HI>Anarchia.</HI></P>

Perhaps the&s;e weakne&s;&s;es were permitted, that human nature might receive fre&s;h honors in America, by the con|tending parties (whether produced by the controver|&s;ies about independence or the national government) mutually forgiving each other, and uniting in plans of general order and happine&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>AN INQUIRY INTO THE Relation of Ta&s;tes and Aliments TO EACH OTHER; AND INTO THE INFLUENCE OF THIS RELATION UPON Health and Plea&s;ure.</HEAD>
<P>IN entering upon this &s;ubject, I feel like the clown, who, after &s;everal un&s;ucce&s;sful attempts to play upon a violin, threw it ha&s;tily from him, exclaiming at the &s;ame time, that "there was mu&s;ic in it," but that he could not bring it out.</P>
<P>I SHALL endeavour, by a few brief remarks, to lay a foundation for more &s;ucce&s;sful inquiries upon this difficult &s;ubject.</P>
<P>ATTRACTION and repul&s;ion &s;eem to be the active principles of the univer&s;e. They pervade not only the greate&s;t but the minute&s;t works of nature. Salts, earths, inflammable bodies, metals, and vegetables, have all their re&s;pective relations to each other. The order of the&s;e relations is &s;o uniform, that it has been a&s;cribed by &s;ome philo&s;ophers to a latent principle of intelligence pervading each of them.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="022123_0195_0FB6E820D8ACE118">
COLORS, odors, and &s;ounds, have likewi&s;e their re&s;pective relations to each other. They become agree|able and di&s;agreeable, only in proportion to the na|tural or unnatural combination which takes place be|tween each of their different &s;pecies.</P>
<P>IT is remarkable, that the number of original colors and notes in mu&s;ic is exactly the &s;ame. All the va|riety in both proceeds from the difference of combi|nation. An arbitrary combination of them is by no means productive of plea&s;ure. The relation which every color and &s;ound bear to each other, was as im|mutably e&s;tabli&s;hed at the creation, as the order of the heavenly bodies, or as the relation of the objects of chemi&s;try to each other.</P>
<P>BUT this relation is not confined to colors and &s;ounds alone. It probably extends to the objects of human aliment. For example; bread and meat, meat and &s;alt, the alkale&s;cent meats and ace&s;cent vegetables, all harmonize with each other upon the tongue; while fi&s;h and fle&s;h, butter and raw onions, fi&s;h and milk, when combined, are all offen&s;ive to a pure and healthy ta&s;te.</P>
<P>IT would be agreeable to trace the analogy of &s;ounds and ta&s;tes. They have both their flats and their &s;harps. They are both improved by the contra&s;t of di&s;cords. Thus pepper, and other condiments, (which are di&s;|agreeable when taken by them&s;elves) enhance the re|li&s;h of many of our aliments, and they are both de|lightful in proportion as they are &s;imple in their com|po&s;ition. To illu&s;trate this analogy by more exam|ples from mu&s;ic, would lead us from the &s;ubject of the pre&s;ent inquiry.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="022123_0196_0FB6E82FAF604BC0">
IT is ob&s;ervable that the tongue and the &s;tomach, like in&s;tinct and rea&s;on, are, by nature, in uni&s;on with each other. One of the&s;e organs mu&s;t always be di&s;|ordered, when they di&s;agree in a &s;ingle article of ali|ment. When they both unite in articles of diet that were originally di&s;agreeable, it is owing to a perver&s;i|on in each of them, &s;imilar to that which takes place in the human mind, when both the moral faculty and the con&s;cience lo&s;e their natural &s;en&s;ibility to virtue and vice.</P>
<P>UNFORTUNATELY for this part of &s;cience, the ta&s;te and the &s;tomach are &s;o much perverted in infancy and childhood by heterogeneous aliment, that it is dif|ficult to tell what kinds and mixtures of food are na|tural, and what are artificial. It is true, the &s;y&s;tem po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a power of accommodating it&s;elf both to ar|tificial food, and to the mo&s;t di&s;cordant mixtures of that which is natural; but may we not rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e, that the &s;y&s;tem would pre&s;erve its natural &s;trength and order much longer, if no &s;uch violence had been offered to it?</P>
<P>IF the relation of aliments to each other follows the analogy of the objects of chemi&s;try, then their union will be influenced by many external circum&s;tances, &s;uch as heat and cold, dilution, concentration, re&s;t, motion, and the addition of &s;ub&s;tances which promote unnatural, or de&s;troy natural mixtures. This idea en|larges the field of inquiry before us, and leads us &s;till further from facts and certainty upon this &s;ubject, but at the &s;ame time it does not preclude us from the hope of obtaining both; for every difficulty that ari&s;es out of this view of the &s;ubject, may be removed by ob|&s;ervation and experiment.</P>

<P N="1">1. WHEN an article of diet is grateful to the ta&s;te, and afterwards di&s;agrees with the &s;tomach, may it not be occa&s;ioned by &s;ome other kind of food, or by &s;ome drink being taken into the &s;tomach, which refu&s;es to unite with the offending article of diet?</P>
<P N="2">2. MAY not the unea&s;ine&s;s which many per&s;ons feel after a moderate meal, ari&s;e from its having con|&s;i&s;ted of articles of aliment which were not related to each other?</P>
<P N="3">3. MAY not the delicacy of &s;tomach which &s;ome|times occurs after the fortieth or forty-fifth year of human life, be occa&s;ioned by nature recovering her empire in the &s;tomach, &s;o as to require &s;implicity in diet, or &s;uch articles only of aliment, as are related? May not this be the rea&s;on why mo&s;t people, who have pa&s;&s;ed tho&s;e periods of life, are unable to retain or to dige&s;t fi&s;h and fle&s;h at the &s;ame time, and why they ge|nerally dine only upon one kind of food?</P>
<P N="4">4. IS not the language of nature in favor of &s;im|plicity in diet, di&s;covered by the avidity with which the luxurious and intemperate often &s;eek relief from variety and &s;atiety, by retreating to &s;pring water for drink, and to bread and milk, for aliment?</P>
<P N="5">5. MAY not the rea&s;on why plentiful meals of fi&s;h, veni&s;on, oy&s;ters, beef or mutton, when eaten alone,

lie &s;o ea&s;ily in the &s;tomach, and dige&s;t &s;o &s;peedily, be occa&s;ioned by no other food being taken with them? A pound, and even more, of the above articles, fre|quently oppre&s;s the &s;y&s;tem much le&s;s than half the quantity of heterogeneous aliments.</P>
<P N="6">6. DOES not the facility with which a due mixture of vegetable and animal food dige&s;ts in the &s;tomach, in|dicate the certainty of their relation to each other?</P>
<P N="7">7. MAY not the peculiar good effects of a diet whol|ly vegetable, or animal, be occa&s;ioned by the more frequent and intimate relation of the articles of the &s;ame kingdoms to each other?

<P>PERHAPS the extraordinary cures of ob&s;tinate di&s;|ea&s;es which are &s;ometimes performed by per&s;ons not regularly educated in phy&s;ic, may be occa&s;ioned by a long and &s;teady per&s;everance in the u&s;e of a &s;ingle arti|cle of the materia medica. Tho&s;e chemical medicines which decompo&s;e each other, are not the only &s;ub&s;tan|ces which defeat the intention of the pre&s;criber. Ga|lenical medicines, by combination, I believe, frequent|ly produce effects that are of a compound and contra|ry nature to their original and &s;imple qualities. This remark is capable of exten&s;ive application, but I quit it as a digre&s;&s;ion from the &s;ubject of this inquiry.</P>
<P N="10">10. I WISH it to be ob&s;erved, that I have condemn|ed the mixture of different aliments in the &s;tomach only in a few ca&s;es, and under certain circum&s;tances. It remains yet to determine by experiments, what chan|ges are produced upon aliments by heat, dilution, ad|dition, concentration, motion, re&s;t, and the addition
<PB N="203" REF="022123_0200_0FB6E43E54CD87F0">
of uniting &s;ub&s;tances, before we can decide upon the relation of aliments to each other, and the influence of that relation upon health. The olla podrida of Spain, is &s;aid to be a plea&s;ant and whole&s;ome di&s;h. It is probably rendered &s;o, by a previous tendency of all its ingredients to putrefaction, or by means of heat producing a new arrangement, or addition new rela|tions of all its parts. I &s;u&s;pect heat to be a powerful agent in di&s;po&s;ing heterogeneous aliments to unite with each other; and hence a mixture of aliments is probably le&s;s unhealthy in France and Spain, than in England, where &s;o much le&s;s fire is u&s;ed in preparing them than in the former countries.</P>
<P>AS too great a mixture of glaring colors, which are related to each other, becomes painful to the eye, &s;o too great a mixture of related aliments oppre&s;&s;es the &s;to|mach, and debilitates the powers of the &s;y&s;tem. The original colors of the &s;ky, and of the &s;urface of the globe, have ever been found the mo&s;t permanently agreeable to the eye. In like manner, I am di&s;po&s;ed to believe that there are certain &s;imple aliments which corre&s;pond, in their &s;en&s;ible qualities, with the intermediate colors of <HI>blue</HI> and <HI>green,</HI> that are mo&s;t permanently agreeable to the tongue and &s;tomach, and that every deviation from them is a departure from the &s;implicity of health and nature.</P>
<P N="11">11. WHILE nature &s;eems to have limited us to &s;implicity in aliment, is not this re&s;triction abundant|ly compen&s;ated by the variety of ta&s;tes which &s;he al|lows us to impart to it in order to diver&s;ify and increa&s;e the plea&s;ure of eating? It is remarkable that &s;alt, &s;ugar, mu&s;tard, hor&s;e-radi&s;h, capers, and &s;pices of all kinds, according to Mr. Go&s;&s;e's experiments, related by Ab|b&egrave;

Spallanzani<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Di&s;&s;ertations, Vol. 1. Page 326.</NOTE>, all contribute not only to render ali|ments &s;avoury, but to promote their dige&s;tion.</P>
<P N="12">12. WHEN we con&s;ider, that part of the art of cookery con&s;i&s;ts in rendering the ta&s;te of aliments a|greeable, is it not probable that the plea&s;ure of eating might be increa&s;ed beyond our pre&s;ent knowledge upon that &s;ubject, by certain new arrangements or mixtures of the &s;ub&s;tances which are u&s;ed to impart a plea&s;ant ta&s;te to our aliment?</P>
<P N="13">13. SHOULD philo&s;ophers ever &s;toop to this &s;ub|ject, may they not di&s;cover and a&s;certain a table of the relations of &s;apid bodies to each other, with the &s;ame accuracy that they have a&s;certained the relation of the numerous objects of chemi&s;try to each other?</P>
<P N="14">14. WHEN the tongue and &s;tomach agree in the &s;ame kinds of aliment, may not the increa&s;e of the plea&s;ure of eating be accompanied with an increa&s;e of health and a prolongation of life?</P>
<P N="15">15. UPON the plea&s;ure of eating, I &s;hall add the following remarks. In order to render it truly ex|qui&s;ite, it is nece&s;&s;ary that all the &s;en&s;es, except that of ta&s;te, &s;hould be as <HI>quie&s;cent</HI> as po&s;&s;ible. Tho&s;e per|&s;ons mi&s;take the nature of the appetite for food, who attempt to whet it by accompanying a dinner by a band of mu&s;ic, or by connecting the dining table with an exten&s;ive and delightful pro&s;pect. The excitement of one &s;en&s;e, always produces collap&s;e in another. Even conver&s;ation &s;ometimes detracts from the plea&s;ure of eating; hence great feeders love to eat in &s;ilence, or alone; and hence the &s;peech of a pa&s;&s;ionate Frenchman,
<PB N="205" REF="022123_0202_0FB6E452438CB4E8">
while dining in a talkative company, was not &s;o im|proper as might at fir&s;t be imagined. "Hold your tongues, (&s;aid he) I cannot ta&s;te my dinner." I know a phy&s;ician who, upon the &s;ame principle, always &s;huts his eyes, and reque&s;ts &s;ilence in a &s;ick chamber, when he wi&s;hes to determine by the pul&s;e the propriety of blood-letting, in ca&s;es where its indication is doubtful. His perceptions become more di&s;tinct, by confining his whole attention to the &s;en&s;e of feeling.</P>
<P>IT is impo&s;&s;ible to mention the circum&s;tance of the &s;en&s;es acting only in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to each other in the enjoyment of plea&s;ure, without being &s;truck by the im|partial goodne&s;s of Heaven, in placing the rich and the poor &s;o much upon a level in the plea&s;ures of the table. Could the numerous objects of plea&s;ure, which are ad|dre&s;&s;ed to the ears and the eyes, have been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed at the &s;ame time, with the plea&s;ure of eating, the rich would have commanded three times as much plea&s;ure in that enjoyment as the poor; but this is &s;o far from being the ca&s;e, that a king has no advantage over a beggar, in eating the &s;ame kind of aliment.</P>
<P>WITH this remark, I &s;hall clo&s;e this collec|tion of Inquiries and Ob&s;ervations. To the intere&s;ts of &s;cience and humanity, I thus publicly devote them. If the hi&s;tories of epidemics, which I have given, con|tain no di&s;coveries, they may perhaps prove u&s;eful, by &s;hewing the degrees of affinity between &s;imilar di&s;ea&s;es in the &s;ame latitudes, and in the &s;ame &s;tate of &s;ociety in different countries, and thereby contribute to form a complete &s;y&s;tem of the hi&s;tory of epidemics.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="022123_0203_0FB6E4536BA8B260">
I SHALL make no apology for having &s;ugge&s;ted &s;everal new remedies for common di&s;ea&s;es. Each of tho&s;e remedies has been &s;o often, and &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully, admini&s;tered in Philadelphia, and in the neighbouring &s;tates, that I &s;hall leave them to plead their own cau&s;e before the bar of the public.</P>
<P>AN apology will be more nece&s;&s;ary for tho&s;e opi|nions in which I have taken the liberty of differing from &s;ome of the pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;y&s;tems of medi|cine. My motives for publi&s;hing the&s;e opinions were, that if true, they might be placed in a &s;ituation to re|ceive &s;upport from the inquiries and ob&s;ervations of other phy&s;icians; and if they are erroneous, that they might, as &s;peedily as po&s;&s;ible, be examined and re|futed. Nor will my errors be without benefit to me|dicine. <Q>Men (&s;ays M. de Fontenelle) cannot, upon any &s;ubject, arrive at what is <HI>rational,</HI> till they have fir&s;t, on that very &s;ubject, exhau&s;ted all imaginable <HI>folly.</HI> How many ab&s;urdities (adds the &s;ame en|lightened author) &s;hould we not now utter, if the ancients had not &s;aid them before us, and thus de|livered us from the trouble of repeating them.</Q>&mdash;The uniformity of nature in this in&s;tance, with her conduct in the production of moral happine&s;s, de&s;erves our particular attention. As good can be known by mortals, only by the means of evil; &s;o truth, perhaps, can be di&s;covered by them, only through the means of error.</P>

<P>IT mu&s;t afford no &s;mall plea&s;ure to a benevolent mind in the mid&s;t of a war, which daily makes &s;o much havoc with the human &s;pecies, to reflect, that the &s;mall-pox which once proved equally fatal to thou|&s;ands, has been checked in its career, and in a great degree &s;ubdued by the practice of INOCULATION.</P>
<P>IT is foreign to my purpo&s;e to deliver to you the hi&s;tory of this art, and to mark the various &s;teps that have attended its progre&s;s to its pre&s;ent &s;tate of im|provement. We have yet to lament the want of uni|formity and of equal &s;ucce&s;s in the practice of it a|mong phy&s;icians. A great number of pamphlets have been written upon the &s;ubject without exhau&s;ting it. There is &s;till ample room left for the man of genius to exerci&s;e his talents for ob&s;ervation and rea&s;oning upon it. The facts I mean to lay before you are &s;o incon|&s;iderable, compared with what &s;till remain to be known upon this &s;ubject, that I have to reque&s;t, when your knowledge in it is compleated, that you would bury my name in &s;ilence; and forget that ever I ventured to lay a &s;ingle &s;tone in this part of the fabric of &s;cience.</P>

</LIST></P>
<P>I. FORMERLY there were great difficulties in the choice of the &s;ubjects for <HI>Inoculation.</HI> But experience teaches us that it may be practi&s;ed in every &s;tage of life, and in almo&s;t every condition of the human body. In infancy the periods before and after dentition are to be preferred. But we &s;eldom &s;ee any great inconve|niencies from &s;ubmiting to the general nece&s;&s;ity of ino|culating children between the ages of three months and two years. Indeed we often &s;ee children cut three or four teeth during the preparation and eruptive fever without the lea&s;t addition being made to any of the trouble&s;ome &s;ymptoms which accompany the &s;mall-pox. There is one inconvenience attending the choice of the fir&s;t months of infancy for inoculating, and that is, the matter often fails of producing the di&s;order in &s;uch young &s;ubjects. I have frequently failed in two or three attempts to communicate the di&s;order to children under four months old with the &s;ame matter that has &s;ucceeded in a dozen other patients inoculated at the &s;ame time. When the inoculation &s;ucceeds in &s;uch ten|der &s;ubjects, they generally have le&s;s fever, and fewer pu&s;tules, than are common in any future period of life.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH a phy&s;ician would prefer a patient in good health to any other as a &s;ubject for inoculation, yet ca&s;es often occur in which it is nece&s;&s;ary to communi|cate
<PB N="5" REF="022123_0207_0FB6E46AB2023B18">
the &s;mall-pox while the body is affected with &s;ome other di&s;order. I can with plea&s;ure inform you, that the &s;mall-pox is rendered &s;o perfectly &s;afe by ino|culation, that there are few chronic di&s;ea&s;es which &s;hould be con&s;idered as ob&s;tacles in the way of it. I have inoculated patients labouring under a tertian fe|ver, ob&s;tructed vi&s;cera, the hooping cough, the hypo|chondria&s;is, the a&s;thma, the itch, and other cutaneous di&s;orders, and even pregnant women, with the &s;ame, and in &s;ome in&s;tances, with greater &s;ucce&s;s than per|&s;ons in perfect health. Doct. <HI>Cullen</HI> informs us that he has &s;een inoculation &s;ucceed in &s;crophulous patients. A phy&s;ician in <HI>Jamaica</HI> informed me that he had ino|culated Negroes with &s;ucce&s;s in the wor&s;t &s;tage of the yaws. To the&s;e facts I mu&s;t add one more extraor|dinary than any that has been yet mentioned: Doct. <HI>Brown,</HI> my late colleague in the care of the military ho&s;pitals, informed me, that he had &s;een inoculation &s;ucceed in patients who were &s;eized, after the infecti|on was communicated with the ho&s;pital fever. The preparation of the body &s;hould be accommodated to the di&s;ea&s;e which affects it. Some phy&s;icians have thought the &s;mall-pox received in this way, was a re|medy for other di&s;ea&s;es, but my experience has not confirmed this opinion. On the contrary, I am di&s;|po&s;ed to think that no other change is produced by inoculation than by the regimen and medicines that are u&s;ed to prepare the body for the &s;mall-pox. Nor does the &s;mall-pox, during its continuance, afford any &s;ecurity again&s;t the attacks of other di&s;ea&s;es. I have &s;een the mo&s;t alarming complication of the &s;mall-pox and mea&s;les in the &s;ame per&s;on.</P>
<P>THE &s;ea&s;ons commonly preferred for inoculation in this country are, the &s;pring and fall. It may be prac|ti&s;ed
<PB N="6" REF="022123_0208_0FB6E46C36BCF468">
with equal &s;afety in the winter, a due regard be|ing had to the temperature of the air in the preparati|on of the body.</P>
<P>THE principal objection to inoculating in the &s;um|mer months in this climate, ari&s;es from the frequency of bilious di&s;orders at that &s;ea&s;on, to which the prepa|ration nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;mall-pox probably di&s;po&s;es the body. This caution applies more directly to children who at a certain age are more &s;ubject than grown peo|ple to a di&s;order in their bowels in warm weather.</P>
<P>II. THE methods of communicating the &s;mall-pox by inoculation, have been different in different coun|tries, and in the different aeras of its progre&s;s towards its pre&s;ent &s;tage of improvement. The &s;cab, do&s;&s;el of lint, and the thread impregnated with variolous matter and bound up in a ga&s;h in the arm, have been laid a&s;ide.</P>
<P>WE are indebted to Mr. <HI>Sutton</HI> for the mode of communicating it by a &s;light puncture with the point of a lancet, or needle, dipt in fre&s;h matter. As it is dif|ficult &s;ometimes to procure matter in a fre&s;h &s;tate, I have been led to u&s;e it with equal &s;ucce&s;s by pre&s;erv|ing it on lint in a box, and moi&s;tening it with cold water ju&s;t before I u&s;ed it. Matter may be kept in this way for a month without lo&s;ing its infectious quality, provided it be not expo&s;ed to heat or moi&s;ture. The former de&s;troys its power of infecting as certain|ly as the &s;alt of tartar de&s;troys the acidity of vinegar. Moi&s;ture by remaining long upon the matter, proba|bly de&s;troys its virulence by &s;ubjecting it to fermenta|tion. The longer matter has been kept in a general way, the longer the di&s;tance will be between the time
<PB N="7" REF="022123_0209_0FB6E47EF31F72B8">
of communicating the di&s;order and the eruptive fever. It will be proper always to yield to the prejudices of our patients in favour of matter taken from per&s;ons who have but few pu&s;tules. But I am per&s;uaded from re|peated ob&s;ervations, that the di&s;ea&s;e is no ways influen|ced by this circum&s;tance. I am &s;atisfied likewi&s;e that there is no difference between the effects of the matter, whether it be taken in its watery or purulent &s;tate. The puncture &s;hould not be larger than is &s;ufficient to draw one drop of blood, but it &s;hould always be made by a <HI>&s;harp</HI> lancet, for the &s;udden inflammation and &s;uppu|ration, excited by a dull lancet, &s;ometimes throw off the matter &s;o as to prevent its infecting the body<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I am di&s;po&s;ed to believe that the external applications which are u&s;ed by the Indians for the cure of the bite of poi&s;onous &s;nakes, act only by exciting inflammation and &s;uppuration, which di&s;charge the poi&s;on from the wound before it is ab&s;orbed. All their external remedies are of a <HI>&s;timulating</HI> na|ture.</NOTE>. No pla&s;ter or bandage &s;hould be applied over the puncture. It &s;hould be made in the left arm of all &s;ubjects. The objections to inoculating in the leg are too obvious to be mentioned. I have heard of the di&s;ea&s;e being communicated by rubbing the dry &s;kin with the matter. My own ob&s;ervations upon this &s;ub|ject give me rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect the facts that are con|tained in books relative to this mode of infecting the body. I have bound large pieces of lint dipt in fre&s;h matter for 24 hours upon the arm, without producing the di&s;order. A practitioner of phy&s;ic in New-Jer|&s;ey informed me that he once gave a con&s;iderable quan|tity of fre&s;h variolous matter in a do&s;e of phy&s;ic with|out infecting his patient. I &s;u&s;pect the matter that produces the di&s;ea&s;e is of the &s;ame nature with certain poi&s;ons, which require to be brought in contact with a wound or &s;ore in the body before they produce their effects. I deliver this opinion with diffidence. The
<PB N="8" REF="022123_0210_0FB6E480E68FA0B8">
&s;ubject &s;tands in need of more experiments and inve&s;ti|gation.</P>
<P>III. I COME now to con&s;ider the be&s;t method of preparing the body for the &s;mall-pox. This mu&s;t be done, 1&s;t by DIET, and 2dly by MEDICINE. The DIET &s;hould con&s;i&s;t chiefly of vegetables. I have ne|ver &s;een any inconvenience from the free u&s;e of milk as a part of the preparative diet. In &s;ome habits, where a morbid acid prevails in the &s;tomach, we may indulge our patients in a little weak fle&s;h broth two or three times a week with &s;afety. Tea, coffee, and even weak chocolate, with bi&s;cuit or dry toa&s;t, may be u&s;ed as u&s;ual, by per&s;ons accu&s;tomed to that kind of aliment. Wine and &s;pirits of all kinds &s;hould be withheld from our patients during the preparation. The more ace&s;|cent their drinks are, the better. It is unnece&s;&s;ary that this change in the diet &s;hould take place till a day or two before the time of communicating the di&s;order. The &s;y&s;tem accommodates to a vegetable and low diet in the cour&s;e of three weeks or a month, &s;o as to de|feat in &s;ome mea&s;ure the advantages we expected from it. The good effects of it appear to depend in a great degree upon the <HI>&s;uddenne&s;s</HI> with which we oblige our patients to conform to it. For this rea&s;on, when we are called upon to inoculate per&s;ons who have lived more than three or four weeks upon a low diet, we &s;hould always direct them to live a few days upon a|nimal food before we communicate the di&s;order to them. By the&s;e means we may produce all the good effects of the <HI>&s;udden</HI> change in the diet I have already mentioned. 2. The MEDICINES mo&s;t commonly u&s;ed to prepare the body for the &s;mall-pox are antimo|ny and mercury. The latter has had the preference, and has been given in large quantities under a notion
<PB N="9" REF="022123_0211_0FB6E4829111CFE0">
of its being a &s;pecific antidote to the variolous matter. Many objections might be made to this opinion; I &s;hall mention only three.</P>
<P N="1">1. WE often &s;ee the di&s;order in a high degree af|ter the &s;y&s;tem is fully impregnated with mercury.</P>
<P N="2">2. WE often &s;ee the &s;ame &s;alutary effects of mer|cury when given before the di&s;order is communicated to the body, that we perceive when it is given after inoculation; in which ca&s;e we are &s;ure the mercury cannot enter into mixture with the variolous matter &s;o as to de&s;troy it.</P>
<P N="3">3. IF mercury acted &s;pecifically in de&s;troying the variolous matter, it would render every other part of the preparation unnece&s;&s;ary, but this we know is not the ca&s;e, for the neglect or improper u&s;e of the vege|table diet or cool regimen is often attended with an extraordinary number, or virulence of the &s;mall-pox, even in tho&s;e ca&s;es where mercury is given in the large&s;t quantity.</P>
<P>THE way in which mercury prepares the body for the &s;mall-pox, &s;eems to be by promoting the &s;everal excretions, particularly that by per&s;piration, which by dimini&s;hing the quantity of the fluids and weakening the tone of the &s;olids, renders the &s;y&s;tem le&s;s liable to a plentiful eruption of the &s;mall-pox. But I object to the u&s;e of this medicine for the following rea&s;ons.</P>
<P N="1">1. IT effectually deprives us of all the benefits of the cool regimen; for mercury, we know, always <HI>di&s;po&s;es</HI> the &s;y&s;tem to take hold.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="10" REF="022123_0212_0FB6E4841F2FBFD8">
2. ALL the good effects of mercury may be procu|red by PURGES which do not &s;ubject the body to the above mentioned inconvenience.</P>
<P>THE PURGES may be &s;uited to the con&s;titutions, and in &s;ome ca&s;es, even to the inclinations of our pati|ents. I have &s;een jalap, rhubarb, &s;enna, manna, a|loes, &s;oluble tartar, Glauber and Ep&s;om &s;alts, and the butternut pill, all given with equal &s;ucce&s;s. The quan|tity &s;hould be &s;ufficient to procure three or four &s;tools every day. A little magne&s;ia &s;hould always be mix|ed with rhubarb and jalap in preparing children. It will be &s;ufficint for the mothers and nur&s;es of infants to conform &s;trictly to the vegetable diet. I have ne|ver &s;een any advantages from giving them even a &s;ingle do&s;e of phy&s;ic.</P>
<P>IT is hardly nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that the quality, do&s;e, and number of purges are to be determined by the age, &s;ex, and habits of our patients. A con&s;ti|tution enfeebled with a previous di&s;ea&s;e forbids the u&s;e of purges, and requires medicines of a re&s;torative kind. Patients afflicted with cutaneous di&s;orders bear larger and more frequent do&s;es of phy&s;ic than are in|dicated in more healthy &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>IN adult &s;ubjects of a plethoric habit, blood|letting is very u&s;eful on the third or fourth day after inoculation. We are not to &s;uppo&s;e, that every fat per&s;on labours under a plethora. A moderate de|gree of fat is &s;o far from rendering the di&s;ea&s;e more violent, e&s;pecially in children, that I think I have generally found &s;uch &s;ubjects have the &s;mall-pox more favourably than others.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="022123_0213_0FB6E491E1EA1930">
MODERATE exerci&s;e in the open air &s;hould be u&s;ed during the preparation. But hard labour and every thing that promotes &s;weat or fatigue, as al&s;o the extremes of heat and cold, &s;hould be avoided.</P>
<P>IV. WE come now to con&s;ider the treatment of the body during the eruptive fever. On the eighth day after inoculation our patients are <HI>generally</HI> &s;eized with the common &s;ymptoms of fever. Some|times this fever appears on the &s;ixth and &s;eventh day after inoculation. But when it is irregular it is often delayed till the ninth and tenth days. I have &s;een many in&s;tances of it on the fourteenth, a few on the fifteenth and &s;ixteenth, and <HI>one</HI> ca&s;e in which it did not come on till the eighteenth day after the infection was communicated to the body<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Since the publication of the fir&s;t edition of this lecture, I have heard of two ca&s;es, in one of which the fever did not come on till the 20th, and in the other till the 21&s;t day after the infection was communicated to the body. In &s;ome of the&s;e tedious ca&s;es. I have &s;een an inflamma|tion and &s;uppuration on the punctured part of the arm on the 8th day without any fever. Perhaps in the&s;e ca&s;es the inflammation and &s;uppuration are only cuticular, and that the &s;mall-pox is taken from the matter which is formed by them.</NOTE>. The place where the puncture was made with the lancet or needle generally &s;erves as an harbinger of the ap|proaching fever. A &s;light inflammation appears about it and a pock ri&s;es up in the center. But this remark is liable to &s;ome objections. I have &s;een <HI>four</HI> in&s;tances in which the fever came on at the ex|pected time, and the di&s;order went thro' all its &s;tages with the greate&s;t regularity, and yet there was no &s;ign of an inflammation or pock near the &s;pot where the puncture was made: even the puncture it&s;elf became invi&s;ible. On the other hand we &s;ometimes &s;ee an inflammation and pock on the arm appear on the eighth and ninth days without any fever accom|panying

them. Some phy&s;icians pretend that this inflammation and &s;olitary pock are &s;ufficient to con|&s;titute the di&s;ea&s;e, but repeated experience has taught me to be very cautious in relying upon the&s;e equi|vocal marks. It is true, I have &s;ometimes &s;een pa|tients &s;ecured again&s;t the &s;mall-pox both in the na|tural way and by inoculation where the&s;e marks have appeared; but I have as often &s;een &s;uch patients &s;eized afterwards with the &s;mall-pox in the natural way to the great di&s;tre&s;s of families and mortifi|cation of phy&s;icians. Upon this account I make it a con&s;tant practice to advi&s;e a &s;econd or third ino|culation where a fever and eruption have been want|ing. As the ab&s;ence of the&s;e &s;ymptoms is probably occa&s;ioned by the weakne&s;s or age of the variolous matter, or the too high &s;tate of preparation of the body, we &s;hould always guard again&s;t both, by making the puncture the &s;econd time with <HI>fre&s;h</HI> matter, by &s;ubjecting our patients to a <HI>le&s;s</HI> ab&s;temious diet, and by giving fewer do&s;es of phy&s;ic. I have heard it remarked, that if a &s;light redne&s;s and a &s;mall pimple appeared on the arm on the third day after inocula|tion, it was a &s;ign the matter had infected the whole con&s;titution. I acknowledge I have often &s;een a greater degree of redne&s;s on the third than on the &s;econd day after inoculation, but I have not been able to e&s;tabli&s;h a diagno&s;tic mark from it; for I have &s;een the di&s;ea&s;e produced on the u&s;ual days where the redne&s;s has appeared on the &s;econd day, and in &s;ome ca&s;es where it has not appeared until the eruptive fever.</P>
<P>I AM led here unwillingly to di&s;cu&s;s the old que&s;|tion, Is it po&s;&s;ible to have the &s;mall-pox in the natural way after inoculation?&mdash;In many of the
<PB N="13" REF="022123_0215_0FB6E49D408B57E0">
ca&s;es &s;uppo&s;ed to be the &s;mall-pox from inoculation, it is probable the matter has been taken from the chicken-pox, which re&s;embles the &s;mall-pox in many of its peculiarities, but in none more than that of leaving pits or marks on the &s;kin. But there are certainly ca&s;es where there are the mo&s;t irrefragible proofs of the infection implanted by inoculation being of a variolous nature, where the di&s;order has been afterwards taken in the natural way. In the&s;e ca&s;es I would &s;uppo&s;e the variolous matter produced only a topical or cuticular di&s;order. We &s;ee &s;ome|thing analogous to this in nur&s;es who attend pati|ents in the &s;mall-pox. But further, this topical or cuticular infection may be produced by art in per|&s;ons who have had the &s;mall-pox in the natural way. Some years ago I made a puncture on my left hand with a lancet moi&s;tened with variolous matter. On the eighth day an inflammation appeared on the place accompanied with an efflore&s;cence in the neighbour|hood of it, which extended about two inches in every direction from the &s;pot where the puncture was made. On the eleventh day I was &s;urpri&s;ed to find two pocks (if I may venture to call them &s;uch) the one on the out&s;ide of the fourth finger of my left hand, and the other on my forehead. They re|mained there for &s;everal days but without filling with matter, and then dropped off rather in the form of a &s;oft wart than of a common &s;cab. Doct. <HI>Way</HI> of Wilmington repeated the &s;ame experiment upon him&s;elf, but with an i&s;&s;ue to his curio&s;ity more ex|traordinary than that I have ju&s;t now related. On the eighth day after he had made a puncture on his hand, a pock appeared on the &s;pot, which in the u&s;ual time filled with matter, from which he inocu|lated &s;everal children, who &s;ickened at the u&s;ual time,
<PB N="14" REF="022123_0216_0FB6E4A7319EF508">
and went thro' all the common &s;tages and &s;ymptoms of the &s;mall-pox. It would &s;eem from the&s;e facts, that it is nece&s;&s;ary the &s;mall-pox &s;hould produce &s;ome impre&s;&s;ion upon the <HI>whole</HI> &s;y&s;tem, in order to ren|der it ever afterwards incapable of receiving an im|pre&s;&s;ion of a &s;imilar nature. A fever and an erup|tion therefore &s;eem nece&s;&s;ary for this purpo&s;e. As the inflammation of the arm on the eighth day is a &s;ign of the <HI>topical</HI> and cuticular infection, &s;o an eruption (tho' ever &s;o &s;mall) &s;eems to be the only cer|tain &s;ign of the infection of the <HI>whole</HI> &s;y&s;tem. The eruption is the more deci&s;ive in its report in propor|tion as it comes out and goes off in the u&s;ual man|ner of the &s;mall-pox in the natural way. In tho&s;e ca&s;es where patients have been &s;ecured again&s;t a &s;e|cond attack of the di&s;order, where there have been no <HI>obvious</HI> fever or <HI>vi&s;ible</HI> eruption, I think I have ob&s;erved an unu&s;ual inflammation, and a copious and long continued di&s;charge of matter from the arm. Perhaps this may &s;erve as an outlet of the matter, which in other ca&s;es produces the fever and eruption. I am the more di&s;po&s;ed to embrace this opinion from the te&s;timony which &s;everal authors have left us of the effects of ulcers in &s;ecuring the body from the infecti|on of the plague. The effects of i&s;&s;ues are &s;till more to our purpo&s;e. We ob&s;erve a plentiful di&s;charge of matter from them every time the body is expo&s;ed to cold, and the febrile effects of it upon the &s;y&s;tem are thereby frequently obviated. How far a ratio exi&s;ts between the degrees of inflammation and the di&s;charge of matter from the arm, and the degrees of fever and eruption, mu&s;t be determined by future and very accurate ob&s;ervations. If it &s;hould appear that there are the lea&s;t inflammation and &s;malle&s;t di&s;charge where there have been the highe&s;t fever and mo&s;t copious
<PB N="15" REF="022123_0217_0FB6E4A834A50530">
eruption, and on the contrary, if it &s;hould appear that there are the greate&s;t inflammation and di&s;charge where there have been the lea&s;t fever and &s;malle&s;t erup|tion, I mu&s;t beg leave to add, without attempting in this place to explain the rea&s;ons of it, that the re|mark, if generally true, is liable to &s;ome exceptions. But the &s;ubject is involved in darkne&s;s; I &s;hall be &s;atisfied if I have brought you within &s;ight of the promi&s;ed land. Your own ingenuity, like another Jewi&s;h leader, mu&s;t conduct you thither.</P>
<P>THE indications in the treatment of the body during the eruptive fever are,</P>
<P>1&s;t. To regulate the degree of fever.</P>
<P>2d. To mitigate trouble&s;ome and alarming &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>THE fever which produces the eruption is general|ly of the inflammatory kind. It &s;ometimes therefore comes on with the &s;ymptoms of great heat, preceded with chilline&s;s, and determination to the head and brea&s;t, and a full hard pul&s;e. The remedies pro|per in this ca&s;e are,</P>
<P>A. Bloodletting. The quantity to be drawn mu&s;t be regulated by the violence of the &s;ymptoms, the con&s;titution, habits, and even country of the patient, and by the &s;ea&s;on of the year. I have never found more than one bleeding, to the quantity of twelve or fourteen ounces, nece&s;&s;ary in any &s;tage or degree of the eruptive fever of the &s;mall-pox by inoculation.</P>
<P>B. Cool air is of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence in the eruptive fever. The u&s;e of this remedy in fevers
<PB N="16" REF="022123_0218_0FB6E4A991225A40">
marks an aera, not only in the management of the &s;mall-pox, but in medicine. The degrees of cold &s;hould always be increa&s;ed in proportion to the vio|lence of the fever. Stove-rooms, &s;o common in this country, &s;hould be carefully avoided. The more we oblige our patients to &s;et up and walk in the open air, the better. Even in tho&s;e ca&s;es where they lan|gui&s;h mo&s;t for the bed, they &s;hould be encouraged rather to lie upon, than <HI>under</HI> the bed cloaths. Children &s;hould be &s;tript of flannel petticoats that come in contact with their &s;kins, and even clouts &s;hould be laid a&s;ide if po&s;&s;ible, without great inconve|nience, and at any rate they &s;hould be often removed. Great and obvious as the advantages of cold air appear to be in the eruptive fever, it has &s;ometimes been u&s;ed to an exce&s;s that has done mi&s;chief. There are few ca&s;es where a degree of cold below forty of <HI>Farenheit's</HI> thermometer is nece&s;&s;ary in this &s;tage of the &s;mall-pox. When it has been u&s;ed below this, or where patients have been expo&s;ed to a damp atmo&s;phere &s;ome degrees above it, I have heard of inflammations of an alarming nature being produced in the throat and brea&s;t.</P>
<P>C. The bowels, more e&s;pecially of children, &s;hould be kept open with gentle laxatives. And</P>
<P>D. Cool &s;ubacid drinks &s;hould be u&s;ed plentifully until the eruption is completed.</P>
<P>Sometimes the &s;mall-pox comes on with a fever the rever&s;e of that which we have de&s;cribed. The heat is incon&s;iderable, the pul&s;e is weak, and &s;carcely quicker than ordinary, and the patient complains of but &s;light pains in the back and head. Here the treat|ment
<PB N="17" REF="022123_0219_0FB6E4AB12BF2608">
&s;hould be widely different from that which has been mentioned when the fever is of the inflammato|ry kind. Bleeding in this ca&s;e in hurtful, and even cool air mu&s;t be admitted with caution. The bu&s;ine&s;s of the phy&s;ician in this ca&s;e is to excite a gentle action in the &s;anguiferous &s;y&s;tem, in order to produce the degree of fever which is nece&s;&s;ary to the eruption of the pock. For this purpo&s;e he may recommend the u&s;e of warm drinks, and even of a warm bed, with ad|vantage. If the eruption delays beyond the third day, with all the circum&s;tances of debility that have been mentioned, I have frequently ordered my patients to eat a few ounces of animal food, and to drink a gla&s;s or two of wine, with the mo&s;t de&s;irable &s;ucce&s;s. The effects of this indulgence are mo&s;t obvious where the weakne&s;s of the fever and the delay of the erup|tion in children, have made it nece&s;&s;ary to allow it to mothers and nur&s;es.</P>
<P>THE &s;mall-pox by inoculation &s;o &s;eldom comes on with the &s;ymptoms of a putrid fever, that little need be &s;aid of the treatment proper in &s;uch ca&s;es. I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that the cold regimen in the highe&s;t degree, promi&s;es more &s;ucce&s;s in the&s;e ca&s;es than in any others. I have repeatedly been told, that when the &s;mall-pox appears confluent among the Africans, it is a common practice for mothers to rub their children all over with pepper, and plunge them im|mediately afterwards into a &s;pring of cold water. This, they &s;ay, de&s;troys a great part of the pock, and di&s;po|&s;es the remainder to a kindly &s;uppuration. From the &s;ucce&s;s that has attended the u&s;e of the cold bath in putrid fevers in &s;ome parts<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In a di&s;&s;ertation entitled <HI>"Epidemia <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">rna qu<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ati&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">aviam, A<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">. 173<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> afflixit."</HI> publi&s;hed in the appendix to the Act<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> Nat.

in a former lecture, I am di&s;po&s;ed to believe in the efficacy of the African remedy.</P>
<P>THE fever generally la&s;ts three days, and the erup|tion continues for a &s;imilar length of time, counting the la&s;t day of the fever as the fir&s;t day of the erup|tion. But this remark is liable to many exceptions. We &s;ometimes ob&s;erve the eruption to begin on the fir&s;t, and often on the &s;econd day of the fever, and we &s;ometimes meet with ca&s;es in which a &s;econd erup|tion comes on after the fever has abated for &s;everal days, and the fir&s;t eruption con&s;iderably advanced in its progre&s;s towards a complete &s;uppuration. This is often occa&s;ioned by the application of exce&s;&s;ive cold or heat to the body, or by a &s;udden and premature u&s;e of &s;timulating drinks or animal food.</P>
<P>I COME now to treat of the be&s;t method of miti|gating trouble&s;ome and alarming &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>THE only <HI>alarming</HI> &s;ymptom is convul&s;ions, to which children are &s;ubject during the time of dentition. The&s;e have been le&s;s frequent, &s;ince the liberal and judici|ous u&s;e of cool air in the eruptive fever than former|ly. They are often relieved by putting the feet in warm water. But a more effectual and &s;peedy me|thod of curing them is to expo&s;e our patients &s;uddenly to the open air. The colder the air the quicker re|lief it affords in the&s;e ca&s;es. To prevent the return of the fits, as well as to allay any di&s;agreeable and trouble&s;ome &s;tartings, a few drops of laudanum &s;hould
<PB N="19" REF="022123_0221_0FB6E4BF546E2210">
be given. They generally yield in a little while to this excellent remedy.</P>
<P>THE next &s;ymptom which demands the aid of our art, is the inflammation and &s;ore on the arm. Poultices of all kinds &s;hould be laid a&s;ide, as tending to increa&s;e the inflammation and &s;ore. In&s;tead of the&s;e, the part affected &s;hould be wa&s;hed three or four times a day with cold water<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Where the inflammation on the arm has been &s;o con&s;iderable as not to yield immediately to the application of cold water, I have u&s;ed the vegeto mineral water with advantage.</NOTE>. This application is not only agree|able to our patients, but &s;oon checks the progre&s;s of the inflammation, and di&s;po&s;es the &s;ore to heal about the time the eruption is completed. The eyes &s;hould likewi&s;e be wa&s;hed frequently with cold water, to &s;ecure them from pu&s;tules and inflammation. With re&s;pect to tho&s;e alarming or trouble&s;ome &s;ymptoms which oc|cur in tho&s;e ca&s;es where the pocks are numerous, or confluent, they happen &s;o &s;eldom in inoculation that they do not come properly under our notice in this place. They are moreover fully di&s;cu&s;&s;ed by Docts. <HI>Boerhaave, Huxham, Hillary</HI> and other practical writers.</P>
<P>V. I COME now, in the la&s;t place, to deliver a few directions that are nece&s;&s;ary after the eruption and &s;uppuration are over.</P>
<P>IT is well known that eruptions of an ob&s;tinate na|ture &s;ometimes follow the &s;mall-pox. The&s;e I believe are often occa&s;ioned by a too <HI>&s;udden</HI> and &s;peedy u&s;e of animal food. To guard again&s;t the&s;e di&s;agreeable con|&s;equences of inoculation, it is of the utmo&s;t importance to enjoin a cautious and <HI>gradual</HI> return to the free u&s;e of an animal diet, and at the &s;ame time it will be ne|ce&s;&s;ary
<PB N="20" REF="022123_0222_0FB6E4C161446738">
to give our patients a do&s;e or two of purging phy&s;ic.</P>
<P>THUS, gentlemen, have I delivered to you a &s;hort hi&s;tory of the new method of inoculating for the &s;mall-pox. I am aware that prejudices are entertained a|gain&s;t &s;ome parts of it by phy&s;icians of the mo&s;t anci|ent name and character among us. I have witne&s;&s;ed the effects of the old and new methods of preparing the body upon many thou&s;and patients, and I am &s;atisfied not only from my own ob&s;ervations, but from the ex|perience of gentlemen upon who&s;e judgments I rely more than upon my own, that the new method is by far the &s;afe&s;t and mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful. Added to this, I can a&s;&s;ure my pupils, that I have never known a &s;ingle in|&s;tance of a patient prepared and treated in the manner I have de&s;cribed, that ever had an ab&s;ce&s;s after the &s;mall-pox, or even &s;uch an inflammation or &s;ore upon the arm as required the application of a poultice.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS ON THE Duties of a Phy&s;ician, AND THE METHODS OF IMPROVING MEDICINE, ACCOMMODATED TO THE PRESENT STATE OF SOCIETY AND MANNERS IN THE UNITED STATES. DELIVERED IN THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA, ON THE 7th OF FEBRUARY, 1789, AT THE CONCLUSION OF A COURSE OF LECTURES UPON CHEMISTRY AND THE PRACTICE OF PHYSIC.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I SHALL conclude our cour&s;e of lectures, by de|livering to you a few directions for the regulation of your future conduct and &s;tudies, in the line of your profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I SHALL, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> &s;ugge&s;t the mo&s;t probable means of e&s;tabli&s;hing your&s;elves in bu&s;ine&s;s, and of becoming acceptable to your patients, and re&s;pectable in life.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> I SHALL mention a few thoughts which have occurred to me on the mode to be pur&s;ued, in the further pro&s;ecution of your &s;tudies, and for the improvement of medicine.</P>
<P>I. PERMIT me, in the fir&s;t place, to recommend to &s;uch of you as intend to &s;ettle in the country, to e&s;tabli&s;h your&s;elves as early as po&s;&s;ible upon <HI>farms.</HI> My rea&s;ons for this advice are as follow.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="22" REF="022123_0224_0FB6E4D1932876F8">
1. IT will reconcile the country people to the li|berality and dignity of your profe&s;&s;ion, by &s;hewing them that you a&s;&s;ume no &s;uperiority over them from your education, and that you intend to &s;hare with them in tho&s;e toils, which were impo&s;ed upon man in con|&s;equence of the lo&s;s of his innocence. This will pre|vent envy, and render you acceptable to your patients as men, as well as phy&s;icians.</P>
<P N="2">2. BY living on a farm you may &s;erve your coun|try by promoting improvements in agriculture. Che|mi&s;try (which is now an important branch of a medi|cal education) and agriculture are clo&s;ely allied to each other. Hence &s;ome of the mo&s;t u&s;eful books upon agriculture have been written by phy&s;icians. Witne&s;s the e&s;&s;ays of Dr. <HI>Home</HI> of Edinburgh, and of Dr. <HI>Hunter</HI> of York&s;hire in England.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE bu&s;ine&s;s of a farm will furni&s;h you with employment in the healthy &s;ea&s;ons of the year, and thereby deliver you from the taedium vitae, or what is wor&s;e, from retreating to low or improper company. Perhaps one cau&s;e of the prevalence of dram or grog drinking, with which country practitioners are &s;ome|times charged, is owing to their having no regular or profitable bu&s;ine&s;s to employ them in the intervals of their attendance upon their patients.</P>
<P N="4">4. THE re&s;ources of a farm will create &s;uch an in|dependence as will enable you to practice with more dignity, and at the &s;ame time &s;creen you from the trouble of performing unnece&s;&s;ary &s;ervices to your pa|tients. It will change the nature of the obligation between you and them. While <HI>money</HI> is the only means of your &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, your patients will feel that they
<PB N="23" REF="022123_0225_0FB6E4D71CC75710">
are the channels of your daily bread; but while your farm furni&s;hes you with the nece&s;&s;aries of life, your patients will feel more &s;en&s;ibly that the obligation is on their &s;ide, for health and life.</P>
<P N="5">5. THE exigencies and wants of a farm, in <HI>&s;tock</HI> and <HI>labor</HI> of all kinds, will enable you to obtain from your patients a compen&s;ation for your &s;ervices in tho&s;e articles. They all po&s;&s;e&s;s them; and men part with that of which money is only the &s;ign, much more rea|dily than they do with money it&s;elf.</P>
<P N="6">6. THE re&s;ources of a farm will prevent your che|ri&s;hing, for a moment, an impious wi&s;h for the pre|valence of &s;ickne&s;s in your neighbourhood. A heal|thy &s;ea&s;on will enable you to add to the produce of your farm, while the rewards of an unhealthy &s;ea&s;on will enable you to repair the inconvenience of your nece&s;&s;ary ab&s;ence from it. By the&s;e means your pur|&s;uits will be marked by that <HI>variety</HI> and <HI>integrity,</HI> in which true happine&s;s is &s;aid to con&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P N="7">7. LET your farms be &s;mall, and let your <HI>principal</HI> attention be directed to gra&s;s and horticulture. The&s;e afford mo&s;t amu&s;ement, require only moderate labor, and will interfere lea&s;t with your duties to your pro|fe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>II. AVOID &s;ingularities of every kind in your man|ners, dre&s;s, and general conduct. Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton,</HI> it is &s;aid, could not be di&s;tingui&s;hed in company, by any peculiarity, from a common well-bred gentleman. Singularity in any thing, is a &s;ub&s;titute for &s;uch great or u&s;eful qualities as command re&s;pect; and hence we find it chiefly in little minds. The profane and in|delicate
<PB N="24" REF="022123_0226_0FB6E4D819F007A8">
delicate combination of extravagant ideas, improperly called wit, and a formal and pompous manner, whether accompanied by a wig, a cane, or a ring, &s;hould all be avoided, as incompatible with the &s;im|plicity of &s;cience and the real dignity of phy&s;ic. There is more than one way of playing the quack. It is not nece&s;&s;ary, for this purpo&s;e, that a man &s;hould adver|ti&s;e his &s;kill, or his cures, or that he &s;hould mount a phaeton and di&s;play his dexterity in operating to an ignorant and gaping multitude. A phy&s;ician acts the &s;ame part in a different way, who a&s;&s;umes the charac|ter of a madman or a brute in his manners, or who conceals his fallibility by an affected gravity and taci|turnity in his intercour&s;e with his patients. Both characters, like the quack, impo&s;e upon the public. It is true, they deceive different ranks of people; but we mu&s;t remember that there are two kinds of vulgar, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the rich and the poor; and that the rich vulgar are often below the poor, in ignorance and credulity.</P>
<P>III. IT has been objected to our profe&s;&s;ion, that many eminent phy&s;icians have been unfriendly to chri&s;tianity. If this be true, I cannot help a&s;cribing it in part to that neglect of public wor&s;hip with which the duties of our profe&s;&s;ion are often incompatible; for it has been ju&s;tly ob&s;erved, that the neglect of this religious and &s;ocial duty generally produces a relaxa|tion either in principles or morals. Let this fact lead you, in &s;etting out in bu&s;ine&s;s, to acquire &s;uch habits of punctuality in vi&s;iting your patients, as &s;hall not in|terfere with acts of public homage to the SUPREME BEING. Dr. <HI>Gregory</HI> has ob&s;erved, that a cold heart is the mo&s;t frequent cau&s;e of dei&s;m. Where this occurs in a phy&s;ician, it affords a pre&s;umption that he is deficient in humanity. But I cannot admit that in|fidelity
<PB N="25" REF="022123_0227_0FB6E4D9A6851198">
is peculiar to our profe&s;&s;ion. On the con|trary, I believe chri&s;tianity places among its friends more men of exten&s;ive abilities and learning, in medi|cine, than in any other &s;ecular employment. <HI>Stahl, Hoffman, Boerhaave, Sydenham, Haller</HI> and <HI>Fothergill,</HI> were all chri&s;tians. The&s;e enlightened phy&s;icians were con&s;idered as the ornaments of the ages in which they lived, and po&s;terity has ju&s;tly ranked them among the greate&s;t benefactors of mankind.</P>
<P>IV. PERMIT me to recommend to you a regard to all the intere&s;ts of your country. The education of a phy&s;ician gives him a peculiar in&s;ight into the principles of many u&s;eful arts, and the practice of phy&s;ic favours his opportunities of doing good, by dif|fu&s;ing knowledge of all kinds. It was in Rome, when medicine was practi&s;ed only by &s;laves, that phy&s;icians were condemned by their profe&s;&s;ion <Q>mutam exercere artem.</Q> But in modern times, and in free govern|ments, they &s;hould di&s;dain an ignoble &s;ilence upon public &s;ubjects. The hi&s;tory of the American revo|lution has re&s;cued phy&s;ic from its former &s;lavi&s;h rank in &s;ociety. For the honor of our profe&s;&s;ion it &s;hould be recorded, that &s;ome of the mo&s;t intelligent and u&s;eful characters, both in the cabinet and the field, during the late war, have been phy&s;icians. The il|lu&s;trious Dr. <HI>Fothergill</HI> oppo&s;ed faction and tyranny, and took the lead in all public improvements in his native country, without &s;uffering thereby the lea&s;t di|minution of that reputation, or bu&s;ine&s;s, in which, for forty years, he flouri&s;hed almo&s;t without a rival in the city of London.</P>
<P>V. STUDY <HI>&s;implicity</HI> in the preparation of your medicines. My rea&s;ons for this advice are as follow.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="26" REF="022123_0228_0FB6E4E8C8698C98">
1. ACTIVE medicines produce the mo&s;t certain effects in a &s;imple &s;tate.</P>
<P N="2">2. MEDICINES when mixed frequently de&s;troy the efficacy of each other. I do not include chemical medicines alone in this remark. It applies likewi&s;e to galenical medicines. Nor do I a&s;&s;ert that the vir|tues of all the&s;e medicines are impaired by mixture; but we can only determine when they are not, by actual experiments and ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P N="3">3. WHEN medicines of the &s;ame cla&s;s, or even of different cla&s;&s;es, are given together, the <HI>&s;tronge&s;t</HI> only produces an effect. But what are we to &s;ay to a com|pound of two medicines which gives exactly the &s;ame degrees of impre&s;&s;ion to the &s;y&s;tem? The effect of them will probably be &s;uch, if we may judge from analogy, as would have been produced by neither in a &s;imple &s;tate.</P>
<P N="4">4. BY ob&s;erving &s;implicity in your pre&s;criptions, you will always have the command of a greater num|ber of medicines of the &s;ame cla&s;s, which may be u&s;ed in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to each other, in proportion as habit renders the &s;y&s;tem in&s;en&s;ible of their action.</P>
<P N="5">5. BY u&s;ing medicines in a &s;imple &s;tate, you will arrive at an exact knowledge of their virtues and do&s;es, and thereby be able to decide upon the numerous and contradictory accounts, which exi&s;t in our books, of the characters of the &s;ame medicines.</P>
<P>UNDER this head I cannot help adding two more directions.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="27" REF="022123_0229_0FB6E4EE6A1EF580">
1. AVOID &s;acrificing <HI>too much</HI> to the ta&s;te of your patients, in the compo&s;ition of your medicines. The nature of a medicine may, in &s;ome in&s;tances, be wholly changed, by being mixed with &s;weet &s;ub&s;tances. The Author of nature &s;eems to have had a de&s;ign in making medicines unpalatable. Had they been more agree|able to the ta&s;te, they would long ago have yielded to the unbounded appetites of man, and by becoming ar|ticles of diet or condiments, have lo&s;t their efficacy in di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P N="2">2. GIVE as few medicines as po&s;&s;ible in tinctures made with di&s;tilled &s;pirits. Perhaps there are but few ca&s;es in which it is &s;afe to exhibit medicines prepared in &s;pirits, in any other form than in <HI>drops.</HI> Many people have been innocently &s;educed into a love of <HI>&s;trong drink,</HI> from taking large or frequent do&s;es of bitters infu&s;ed in &s;pirits. Let not our profe&s;&s;ion in a &s;ingle in&s;tance be charged with adding to the cala|mities which have been entailed upon mankind by this dreadful &s;pecies of intemperance.</P>
<P>VI. LET me advi&s;e you, in your vi&s;its to the &s;ick, <HI>never</HI> to appear in a hurry, nor to talk of indifferent matters before you have made the nece&s;&s;ary inquiries into the &s;ymptoms of your patient's di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>VII. AVOID making <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of any ca&s;e; <Q>re&s;pice finem</Q> &s;hould be the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of every indi&s;po&s;ition. There is &s;carcely a di&s;order &s;o trifling, that has not, directly or indirectly, proved an outlet to human life. This con&s;ideration &s;hould make you anxious and punc|tual in your attendance upon every acute di&s;ea&s;e, and keep you from ri&s;king your reputation by an improper or ha&s;ty progno&s;is.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="022123_0230_0FB6E4EF5C54C6F0">
VIII. DO not condemn, or oppo&s;e, unnece&s;&s;arily, the &s;imple pre&s;criptions of your patients. Yield to them in matters of little con&s;equence, but maintain an inflexible authority over them in matters that are e&s;&s;en|tial to life.</P>
<P>IX. PRESERVE, upon all occa&s;ions, a compo&s;ed or cheerful countenance in the room of your patients, and in&s;pire as much hope of a recovery as you can, con&s;i&s;tent with truth, e&s;pecially in acute di&s;ea&s;es. The extent of the influence of the will over the human body, has not yet been fully a&s;certained. I reject the futile preten&s;ions of Mr. Me&s;mer to the cure of di&s;|ea&s;es, by what he has ab&s;urdly called animal magne|ti&s;m; but I am willing to derive the &s;ame advan|tages from his deceptions, which the chemi&s;ts have derived from the delu&s;ions of the alchemi&s;ts. The facts which he has e&s;tabli&s;hed, clearly prove the influence of the imagination and will upon di&s;ea&s;es. Let us avail our&s;elves of the aid which the&s;e powers of the mind pre&s;ent to us, in the &s;trife between life and death. I have frequently pre&s;cribed remedies of doubtful ef|ficacy in the critical &s;tage of acute di&s;ea&s;es, but never till I had worked up my patients into a confidence, bordering upon certainty, of their probable good ef|fects. The &s;ucce&s;s of this mea&s;ure has much oftener an&s;wered, than di&s;appointed my expectations; and while my patients have commended the vomit, the purge, or the bli&s;ter which was pre&s;cribed, I have been di&s;po&s;ed to attribute their recovery to the vigorous concurrence of the <HI>will</HI> in the action of the medicine. Does the will beget in&s;en&s;ibility to cold, heat, hunger, and danger? Does it &s;u&s;pend pain, and rai&s;e the body above feeling the pangs of Indian tortures? Let us not then be &s;urpri&s;ed that it &s;hould enable the &s;y&s;tem
<PB N="29" REF="022123_0231_0FB6E4F0DF24ABE8">
to re&s;olve a &s;pa&s;m, to open an ob&s;truction, or to di&s;|charge an offending humor. I have only time to hint at this &s;ubject. Perhaps it would lead us, if we could trace it fully, to &s;ome very important di&s;coveries in the cure of di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>X. PERMIT me to advi&s;e you to attend to that principle in the human mind, which con&s;titutes the a&s;&s;ociation of ideas, in your intercour&s;e with your pa|tients. A chamber, a chair, a curtain, or even a cup, all belong to the means of life or death, accordingly as they are a&s;&s;ociated with cheerful or di&s;tre&s;&s;ing ideas, in the mind of a patient. But this principle is of more immediate application in tho&s;e chronic di&s;ea&s;es which affect the mind. Nothing can be accompli&s;hed here, till we produce a new a&s;&s;ociation of ideas. For this purpo&s;e, a change of place and company are ab&s;olute|ly nece&s;&s;ary. But we mu&s;t &s;ometimes proceed much further. I have heard of a gentleman in South-Ca|rolina, who cured his fits of low &s;pirits by changing his clothes. The remedy was a rational one. It pro|duced at once a new train of ideas, and thus removed the paroxy&s;m of his di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>XI. A PHYSICIAN in &s;ickne&s;s is always a wel|come vi&s;itor in a family: hence he is &s;olicited to par|take of the u&s;ual &s;ign of ho&s;pitality in this country, by taking a draught of &s;ome &s;trong drink every time he enters into the hou&s;e of a patient. Let me charge you to lay an early re&s;traint upon your&s;elves, by refu&s;ing to yield to this practice, e&s;pecially in the forenoon. Many phy&s;icians have been led by it into habits of drunkenne&s;s. You will be in the more danger of fall|ing into this vice, from the fatigue and inclemency of weather to which you will be expo&s;ed in country prac|tice.
<PB N="30" REF="022123_0232_0FB6E4FF48B03670">
But you have been taught that &s;trong drink affords only a temporary relief from tho&s;e evils, and that it tends afterwards to render the body more &s;en|&s;ible of them.</P>
<P>XII. MAKE it a rule never to be angry at any thing a &s;ick man &s;ays or does to you. Sickne&s;s often adds to the natural impatience and irritability of the temper. We are, therefore, to &s;ubmit to the &s;evere and unnece&s;&s;ary toils that are &s;ometimes exacted from us, and to bear even the reproaches of our patients with meekne&s;s and &s;ilence. It is folly to re&s;ent in|juries at any time, but it is cowardice to re&s;ent an in|jury from a &s;ick man; &s;ince, from his weakne&s;s and dependence upon us, he is unable to contend with us upon equal terms. You will find it difficult to attach your patients to you by the obligation of friend&s;hip or gratitude. You will &s;ometimes have the mortificati|on of being de&s;erted by tho&s;e patients who owe mo&s;t to your &s;kill and humanity. This led Dr. <HI>Turner</HI> to advi&s;e phy&s;icians never to chu&s;e their friends from among their patients. But this advice can never be followed by a heart that has been taught to love true excellency, wherever if finds it. I would rather ad|vi&s;e you to give the benevolent feelings of your hearts full &s;cope, and to forget the unkind returns they will often meet with, by giving to human nature&mdash;a tear. Let us not de&s;pair. From the increa&s;ing influence of rea&s;on and religion in our world, the time mu&s;t &s;oon come, when even phy&s;icians, and the brute cre|ation, &s;hall become the objects of the ju&s;tice and hu|manity of mankind.</P>
<P>XIII. AVOID giving a patient over in an acute di&s;ea&s;e. It is impo&s;&s;ible to tell, in &s;uch ca&s;es, where
<PB N="31" REF="022123_0233_0FB6E505C7335E58">
life ends and where death begins. Hundreds of pa|tients have recovered who have been pronounced in|curable, to the great di&s;grace of our profe&s;&s;ion. I know that the practice of predicting danger and death upon every occa&s;ion, is &s;ometimes made u&s;e of by phy&s;icians, in order to enhance the credit of their pre|&s;criptions, if their patients recover, and to &s;ecure a retreat from blame, if they &s;hould die. But this mode of acting is mean and illiberal. It is not nece&s;&s;ary that we &s;hould decide with confidence at any time, upon the i&s;&s;ue of a di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>XIV. CASES will frequently occur in which you will be expo&s;ed to a &s;truggle between a regard for your own reputation, and for the life of a patient. In &s;uch ca&s;es, let chri&s;tianity determine what is to be done. That new commandment which directs us to make the mea&s;ure of our love to our fellow-creatures, the &s;ame as the love of the Author of our religion was to the human race, certainly requires that we &s;hould at all times ri&s;k, and even &s;acrifice reputation, to pre&s;erve the life of a fellow-creature. The pu&s;illanimous, or, as he is commonly called, the <HI>&s;afe</HI> phy&s;ician, who, ab&s;orbed wholly in the care of his own reputation, views without exertion the la&s;t conflict between life and death in a patient, in my opinion will be found hereafter to have been guilty of a breach of the &s;ixth commandment; while the con&s;cientious, or, as he is commonly called, the <HI>bold</HI> phy&s;ician, who lo&s;es &s;ight of his character, and even of the means of his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and by the u&s;e of a remedy of doubtful efficacy turns the &s;cale in favour of life, performs an act that bor|bers upon divine benevolence. A phy&s;ician who has only once in his life enjoyed the godlike plea&s;ure that is connected with &s;uch an act of philanthropy, will
<PB N="32" REF="022123_0234_0FB6E506DDC7C398">
never require any other con&s;ideration to reconcile him to the toils and duties of his profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>XV. I SHALL now give &s;ome directions with re|&s;pect to the method of charging for your &s;ervices to your patients.</P>
<P>WHEN we con&s;ider the expence of a medical edu|cation, and the &s;acrifices a phy&s;ician is obliged to make of ea&s;e, &s;ociety, and even health, to his profe&s;&s;ion; and when we add to the&s;e, the con&s;tant and painful anxiety which is connected with the important charge of the lives of our fellow-creatures, and above all, the ine&s;timable value of that ble&s;&s;ing which is the object of his &s;ervices, I hardly know how it is po&s;&s;ible for a patient &s;ufficiently and ju&s;tly to reward his phy&s;ician. But when we con&s;ider, on the other hand, that &s;ick|ne&s;s deprives men of the means of acquiring money; that it increa&s;es all the expences of living; and that high charges often drive patients from regular-bred phy&s;icians to quacks; I &s;ay, when we attend to the&s;e con&s;iderations, we &s;hould make our charges as mode|rate as po&s;&s;ible, and conform them to the following &s;tate of things.</P>
<P>AVOID mea&s;uring your &s;ervices to your patients by &s;cruples, drachms, and ounces. It is an illiberal mode of charging. On the contrary, let the number and the <HI>time</HI> of your vi&s;its, the nature of your patient's di&s;ea&s;e, and his rank in his family or &s;ociety, deter|mine the figures in your accounts. It is certainly ju&s;t to charge more for curing an apoplexy, than an in|termitting fever. It is equally ju&s;t to demand more for ri&s;king your life by vi&s;iting a patient in a contagi|ous fever, than for curing a pleuri&s;y. You have a
<PB N="33" REF="022123_0235_0FB6E5082A999BF0">
right likewi&s;e to be paid for your anxiety. Charge the &s;ame &s;ervices, therefore, higher to the ma&s;ter or mi&s;tre&s;s of a family, or to an only &s;on or daughter, who call forth all your feelings and indu&s;try, than to le&s;s important members of a family and of &s;ociety. If a rich man demands more frequent vi&s;its than are nece&s;&s;ary, and if he impo&s;es the re&s;traints of keeping to hours by calling in other phy&s;icians to con&s;ult with you upon every trifling occa&s;ion, it will be ju&s;t to make him pay accordingly for it. As this mode of charging is &s;trictly agreeable to rea&s;on and equity, it &s;eldom fails of according with the rea&s;on and &s;en&s;e of equity of our patients. Accounts made out upon the&s;e principles, are &s;eldom complained of by them. I &s;hall only remark further upon this &s;ubject, that the &s;ooner you &s;end in your accounts after your patients recover, the better. It is the duty of a phy&s;ician to inform his patient of the amount of his obligation to him at lea&s;t <HI>once</HI> a year. But there are times when a departure from this rule may be nece&s;&s;ary. An unexpected mis|fortune in bu&s;ine&s;s, and a variety of other accidents, may deprive a patient of the money he had allotted to pay his phy&s;ician. In this ca&s;e, delicacy and hu|manity require, that he &s;hould not know the amount of his debt to his phy&s;ician, till time has bettered his cir|cum&s;tances.</P>
<P>I SHALL only add, under this head, that the poor of every de&s;cription &s;hould be the objects of your pe|culiar care. Dr. Boerhaave u&s;ed to &s;ay, <Q>they were his be&s;t patients, becau&s;e God was their payma&s;ter.</Q> The fir&s;t phy&s;icians that I have known, have found the poor the &s;teps by which they a&s;cended to bu&s;ine&s;s and reputation. Di&s;ea&s;es among the lower cla&s;s of people are generally &s;imple, and exhibit to a phy&s;ician
<PB N="34" REF="022123_0236_0FB6E5099CB41560">
the be&s;t ca&s;es of all epidemics, which cannot fail of ad|ding to his ability of curing the complicated di&s;ea&s;es of the rich and intemperate. There is an in&s;eparable connection between a man's duty and his intere&s;t. Whenever you are called, therefore, to vi&s;it a poor patient, imagine you hear the voice of the good Sa|maritan &s;ounding in your ears, <Q>Take care of him, and I will repay thee.</Q></P>
<P>I COME now to the &s;econd part of this addre&s;s, which was to point out the be&s;t mode to be pur&s;ued, in the further pro&s;ecution of your &s;tudies, and the im|provement of medicine.</P>
<P>I. GIVE me leave to recommend to you, to open all the dead bodies you can, without doing violence to the feelings of your patients, or the prejudices of the common people. Pre&s;erve a regi&s;ter of the weather, and of its influence upon the vegetable productions of the year. Above all, record the epidemics of every &s;ea&s;on; their times of appearing, and di&s;appearing, and the connection of the weather with each of them. Such records, if publi&s;hed, will be u&s;eful to foreigners, and a trea&s;ure to po&s;terity. Pre&s;erve, likewi&s;e, an account of chronic ca&s;es. Record the name, age and occupation of your patient; de&s;cribe his di&s;ea&s;e accu|rately, and the changes produced in it by your reme|dies; mention the do&s;es of every medicine you admi|ni&s;ter to him. It is impo&s;&s;ible to tell how much im|provement and facility in practice you will derive from following the&s;e directions. It has been remarked, that phy&s;icians &s;eldom remember more than the two or three la&s;t years of their practice. The records which have been mentioned, will &s;upply this deficiency of memory, e&s;pecially in that advanced &s;tage of life when the ad|vice of phy&s;icians is &s;uppo&s;ed to be mo&s;t valuable.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="022123_0237_0FB6E517CD72B020">
II. PERMIT me to recommend to you further, the &s;tudy of the anatomy (if I may be allowed the expre&s;|&s;ion) of the human mind, commonly called metaphy|&s;ics. The reciprocal influence of the body and mind upon each other, can only be a&s;certained by an accu|rate knowledge of the faculties of the mind, and of their various modes of combination and action. It is the duty of phy&s;icians to a&s;&s;ert their prerogative, and to re&s;cue the mental &s;cience from the u&s;urpations of &s;choolmen and divines. It can only be perfected by the aid and di&s;coveries of medicine. The authors I would recommend to you upon metaphy&s;ics, are, But|ler, Locke, Hartly Reid, and Beattie. The&s;e ingenious writers have cleared this &s;ublime &s;cience of its technical rubbi&s;h, and rendered it both intelligible and u&s;eful.</P>
<P>III. Do not confine your &s;tudies and attention only to <HI>extraordinary</HI> ca&s;es. The mo&s;t frequent outlets of human life are through the channels of <HI>common</HI> di&s;ea&s;es. A late profe&s;&s;or in the college of Gla&s;gow, when a &s;tudent in one of the London ho&s;pitals, was ob&s;erved to be bu&s;y in examining the pul&s;e of a patient in a fever, while all his fellow &s;tudents were employed in examining with uncommon attention the ca&s;e of a child with two heads that had ju&s;t been brought into the ho&s;pital. Upon being condemned by his compani|ons for neglecting to profit by the examination of &s;o new a ca&s;e, he an&s;wered, "I never expect in the whole cour&s;e of my life to &s;ee, or hear, of another child with two heads: but I expect to meet with fevers in my practice, every day of my life." This &s;en&s;ible an&s;wer admits of exten&s;ive application to the advancement of medicine. Could we eradicate fevers only from our bills of mortality, how much more &s;hould we add to the population and happine&s;s of our country, than by di&s;covering remedies for polypi and aneuri&s;ms?</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="022123_0238_0FB6E51D15B812E8">
IV. LET me remind you, that improvement in medicine is not to be derived, only from colleges and univer&s;ities. Sy&s;tems of phy&s;ic are the productions of men of genius and learning; but tho&s;e facts which con&s;titute real knowledge, are to be met with in every walk of life. Remember how many of our mo&s;t u&s;e|ful remedies have been di&s;covered by quacks. Do not be afraid, therefore, of conver&s;ing with them, and of profiting by their ignorance and temerity in the prac|tice of phy&s;ic. Medicine has its Phari&s;ees, as well as religion. But the &s;pirit of this &s;ect is as unfriendly to the advancement of medicine, as it is to chri|&s;tian charity. By conver&s;ing with quacks, we may convey in&s;truction to them, and thereby le&s;&s;en the mi&s;|chief they might otherwi&s;e do to &s;ociety. But further. In the pur&s;uit of medical knowledge, let me advi&s;e you to conver&s;e with nur&s;es and old women. They will often &s;ugge&s;t facts in the hi&s;tory and cure of di&s;ea|&s;es which have e&s;caped the mo&s;t &s;agacious ob&s;ervers of nature. Even negroes and Indians have &s;ometimes &s;tumbled upon di&s;coveries in medicine. Be not a|&s;hamed to inquire into them. There is yet one more means of information in medicine which &s;hould not be neglected, and that is, to conver&s;e with per&s;ons who have recovered from indi&s;po&s;itions without the aid of phy&s;icians. Examine the &s;trength and exertions of nature in the&s;e ca&s;es, and mark the plain and home|made remedy to which they a&s;cribe their recovery. I have found this to be a fruitful &s;ource of in&s;truction, and have been led to conclude, that if every man in a city, or a di&s;trict, could be called upon to relate to per&s;ons appointed to receive and publi&s;h his narrative, an exact account of the effects of tho&s;e remedies which accident or whim has &s;ugge&s;ted to him, it would fur|ni&s;h a very u&s;eful book in medicine. To pre&s;erve the
<PB N="37" REF="022123_0239_0FB6E520CF07AFD0">
facts thus obtained, let me advi&s;e you to record them in a book to be kept for that purpo&s;e. There is one more advantage that will probably attend the inquiries that have been mentioned; you may di&s;cover di&s;ea&s;es, or &s;ymptoms of di&s;ea&s;es, or even laws of the animal oeconomy, which have no place in our &s;y&s;tems of no|&s;ology, or in our theories of phy&s;ic.</P>
<P>V. IN dangerous ca&s;es that are <HI>plain</HI> and <HI>common,</HI> let me caution you again&s;t having recour&s;e to con&s;ulta|tions. They relax exertion, &s;u&s;pend enterpri&s;e, and le&s;&s;en re&s;pon&s;ibility in a phy&s;ician. They moreover add, unnece&s;&s;arily, to the expences of a patient. But in <HI>difficult</HI> and <HI>ob&s;cure</HI> ca&s;es let me advi&s;e you to an|ticipate the fears of your patients, by <HI>reque&s;ting</HI> a&s;|&s;i&s;tance. Such candor begets &s;ub&s;equent confidence and bu&s;ine&s;s, for truth is the univer&s;al intere&s;t of man|kind. There are few in&s;tances in which any &s;olid ad|vantages have been derived from more than <HI>two</HI> phy|&s;icians con&s;ulting together. Where a greater number are employed, the pre&s;criptions are generally the re|&s;ult of neutralized opinions, and are of cour&s;e often un&s;ucce&s;sful. The epitaph of Pliny, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <Q>Se turba medicorum perui&s;&s;e,</Q> might be in&s;cribed upon the tomb&s;tones of many per&s;ons, who&s;e &s;ick beds had been &s;urrounded by a croud of phy&s;icians.</P>
<P>VI. LET me recommend to your particular attenti|on, the indigenous medicines of our country. Cul|tivate or prepare as many of them as po&s;&s;ible, and en|deavour to enlarge the materia medica, by exploring the untrodden fields and fore&s;ts of the United States. The ipecacuana, the Seneka and Virginia &s;nake roots, the Carolina pink-root, the &s;pice-wood, the &s;a&s;&s;afras, the butter-nut, the thoroughwort, the poke, and the

&s;trammonium, are but a &s;mall part of the medicinal productions of America. I have no doubt but there are many hundred other plants which now exhale in|valuable medicinal virtues in the de&s;art air. Examine, likewi&s;e, the mineral waters, which are &s;o various in their impregnation, and &s;o common in all parts of our country. Let not the properties of the infects of Ame|rica e&s;cape your inve&s;tigation. We have already di&s;|covered among &s;ome of them, a fly equal in its bli&s;ter|ing qualities to the famous fly of Spain. Who knows but it may be reserved for America to furni&s;h the world, from her productions, with cures for &s;ome of tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es which now elude the power of medicine? Who knows but what, at the foot of the Allegany mountain there blooms a flower that is an infallible cure for the epilep&s;y? Perhaps on the Monongahela, or the Potowmac, there may grow a root that &s;hall &s;upply, by its tonic powers, the invigorating effects of the &s;avage or military life in the cure of con&s;umptions. Human mi&s;ery of every kind is evidently on the de|cline. Happine&s;s, like truth, is an unit. While the world, from the progre&s;s of intellectual, moral and political truth, is becoming a more &s;afe and agreeable abode for man, the votaries of medicine &s;hould not be idle. All the doors and windows of the temple of na|ture have been thrown open by the convul&s;ions of the late American revolution. This is the time, therefore, to pre&s;s upon her altars. We have already drawn from them di&s;coveries in morals, philo&s;ophy, and govern|ment, all of which have human happine&s;s for their object. Let us pre&s;erve the unity of truth and hap|pine&s;s, by drawing from the &s;ame &s;ource, in the pre&s;ent critical moment, a knowledge of antidotes to tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es which are &s;uppo&s;ed to be incurable.</P>

I HAVE now, gentlemen, only to thank you for the attention with which you have honored the cour&s;e of lectures which has been delivered to you, and to a&s;&s;ure you, that I &s;hall be happy in rendering you all the &s;ervices that lie in my power, in any way you are plea&s;ed to command me. Accept of my be&s;t wi&s;hes for your happine&s;s, and may the ble&s;&s;ings of hundreds and thou&s;ands who were ready to peri&s;h, be your por|tion in life, your comfort in death, and your reward in the world to come.</P>
