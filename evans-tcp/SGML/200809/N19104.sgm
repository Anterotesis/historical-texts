<HEAD>THOUGHTS CONCERNING THE GOSPEL, &amp;C.</HEAD>
<P>IN attending to a &s;ermon, &s;ome things occurred which brought a pa&s;&s;age in the Epi&s;tle to the Collo&s;ians, to re|membrance, '&s;ay to Archippus, take heed to the mini&s;try that thou ha&s;t received in the Lord, that thou fulfill it;' which produced an inquiry, who Archippus was; and com|paring the Epi&s;tle to the Collo&s;ians, with that to Philemon, it appeared probable, that Philemon, Epaphras and Archip|pus were mini&s;ters of the church of Chri&s;t, gathered from among the Collo&s;ians, which then met in Philemon's hou&s;e; both Epi&s;tles appear to be wrote and &s;ent at the &s;ame time; however, Archippus was a mini&s;ter of the church of Chri&s;t, who received his mini&s;try in the Lord, and yet was the &s;ub|ject of this exhortation: Hence it was concluded that no mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t is above receiving a &s;imilar exhortation from the brethren.</P>
<P>The next inquiry was, what was the mini&s;try he received in the Lord, or which the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t receive in the Lord; &s;uppo&s;ing they receive the &s;ame now, as the mini&s;|ters of the fir&s;t Churches did?</P>
<P>In an&s;wer, it may be &s;aid, that their commi&s;&s;ion was, 'to go into all the world, and preach the go&s;pel to every creature.' It is agreed that the word go&s;pel, &s;ignifies good news, glad tidings: The Prophet and Apo&s;tles agree herein. The Prophet I&s;aiah &s;aith, 'O Zion that bringeth good tid|ings, get thee up into the high mountain; O Jeru&s;alem, that bringe&s;t good tidings, lift up thy voice with &s;trength, lift up, be not affraid: Say to the cities of Judah, behold you God. How beautiful are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publi&s;heth peace, that bringeth good tid|ings of good; that publi&s;heth &s;alvation; that &s;aith unto Zion, thy God reigneth.' And &s;imilar is the word which God &s;ent to the children of I&s;rael; with which Peter was &s;ent to the Gentiles, 'preaching peace, by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, he is Lord of all.'</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="024860_0005_0FCD6BE6CCE894A8">The &s;criptures do not leave us at a lo&s;s, re&s;pecting the&s;e glad tidings, 'for the &s;criptures fore&s;eeing that God would ju&s;tify the heathen<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The heathen that had no claim as being of the &s;tock of I&s;rael that had no worthi|ne&s;s, nothing to recommend them.</NOTE> through faith, preached before the go&s;|pel unto Abraham, &s;aying in thy &s;eed &s;hall all the nations of the earth be ble&s;&s;ed;' the &s;ame go&s;pel is repeated to I&s;aac, and confirmed to Jacob, and is proclaimed from the top of Jacob's ladder, where the Lord &s;tood above it, and &s;aid, 'I am the God of Abraham, thy father, and the God of I&s;aac;' this was al&s;o &s;hown to Mo&s;es at the bu&s;h, and when he was &s;ent to the children of I&s;rael, he was directed to &s;ay unto them, 'I am the God of Abraham, the God of I&s;aac, and the God of Jacob; this is my name forever, and my me|morial unto all generations. It is my unchangable name, the unchangable name; of the unchangable God; in&s;uring ble&s;&s;edne&s;s in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, to all the nations, kin|dreds, and families of the earth. And a believer of this go&s;pel preached to Abraham, enters into re&s;t; although he is in him&s;elf a poor, lo&s;t, wretched, mi&s;erable &s;inner, and under&s;tanding him&s;elf ble&s;&s;ed in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, can rejoice in him, though he hath 'no confidence in the fle&s;h.'</P>
<P>The prophet I&s;aiah &s;peaking of the Gentiles, in his 54th chapter, &s;ays to them, 'fear not for thou &s;hall not be a&s;ham|ed, neither be thou confounded, for thou &s;hall not be put to &s;hame, for thou &s;hall forget the &s;hame of thy youth, and &s;hall not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any more: FOR thy Maker is thy hu&s;band, and thy Redeemer the Holy One of I&s;rael, the God of the whole earth &s;hall he be called.' The Prophet Jeremiah, in his 3d chapter, &s;peaking of Judah and I&s;rael, &s;aith 'turn O back&s;liding children, &s;aith the Lord, for I am married unto you.' And the Pro|phet I&s;aiah, appears to be &s;peaking both of Jews and Gen|tiles, when he &s;ays 'as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, &s;o &s;hall thy God rejoice over thee.'</P>
<P>If the nations, kindreds and families of the earth are ble&s;&s;ed in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and both Jews and Gentiles acknow|ledged as married unto him, then he is 'the God of the whole earth.'</P>
<P>Again, the whole earth are repeatedly called to &s;ing a new &s;ong unto the Lord, as we &s;ee in P&s;alm, 96 1, 98 1,
<PB N="7" REF="024860_0006_0FCD6BE84A590088">
I&s;aiah, 42, 10, 11. This new &s;ong is de&s;cribed, Rev. 5, 9, 'thou art worthy for thou wa&s;t &s;lain and ha&s;t redeemed us to God, by thy blood, out of every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people:' If all the earth are called to &s;ing this new &s;ong, &s;urely all the earth are intere&s;ted in the &s;ubject matter of it.</P>
<P>Again, the mo&s;t oppo&s;ed to the &s;alvation of the go&s;pel, and the preaching of it, are the &s;ubjects of prayer. The P&s;almi&s;t, &s;peaking in the per&s;on of Chri&s;t, in the 42d P&s;alm, where he complains of his reproachers, &s;aying 'my tears have been my meat, day and night, while they continually &s;ay unto me, where is thy God?' And adds, 'when I remember the&s;e, I pour out my &s;oul in me.' This we &s;ee verified when they &s;aid 'he tru&s;ted in God, let him deliver him if he will have him;' and hear Je&s;us Chri&s;t pour out his &s;oul in him, in that prayer 'father forgive them for they know not what they do;' he al&s;o directs his Di&s;ciples 'to love their enemies, and pray for them that de&s;pitefully u&s;e them.' Did he direct them to love tho&s;e whom he did not; did he not die that his enemies might be reconciled by his death; was not he always heard, and did he bid his di&s;ciples pray for what &s;hould not be granted?</P>
<P>Then &s;urely the go&s;pel al&s;o is to be preached to them, and this good news is to be publi&s;hed as a truth among &s;uch characters, 'that God was in Chri&s;t reconciling the world unto him&s;elf, not imputing their tre&s;pa&s;&s;es unto them;' agreeable to the prophet I&s;aiah, 'I have blotted out thy tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions as a cloud, and thine iniquities as a thick cloud, return unto me for I have redeemed thee.'</P>
<P>De&s;igned brevity, forbids the taking notice of many con|&s;iderations that offer them&s;elves, to prove and illu&s;trate this truth, that Chri&s;t's mini&s;ters, commi&s;&s;ion is, 'to preach the go&s;pel to every creature.' Two or three things offer them&s;elves as inquiries or objections, as</P>
<P>1&s;t. If the nations are ble&s;&s;ed in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, both <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> and Gentiles, &s;o that they are married unto him, and he is the God of the whole earth, whence is it &s;uch a place of &s;in and mi&s;ery?</P>
<P>It may be &s;aid, if the woman intere&s;ted in the e&s;tate and honours of her hu&s;band, treacherou&s;ly depart from him,
<PB N="8" REF="024860_0007_0FCD6BEA5AFE04D8">
every &s;tep of her way, mu&s;t be going further into the &s;ink of &s;in and mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>That this was the ca&s;e with antient I&s;rael, is plain from Jeremiah 3, 20, '&s;urely as a wife treacherou&s;ly departs from her hu&s;band, &s;o have you dealt treacherou&s;ly with me O hou&s;e of I&s;rael,' which will be evident to any one that reads the beginning of the chapter, to the 12 ver&s;e, and Ezekiel, 16, 32, 45; and as this was the cau&s;e of the di&s;tre&s;s and mi&s;ery, that befel antient I&s;rael, &s;o it is the cau&s;e of all the calamities that befal us all, in copying after their wretched example. Certainly there is no want of ble&s;&s;ed|ne&s;s in Chri&s;t Je&s;us; no want of power, riches, loving kindne&s;s and mercy, in our Maker, our Hu&s;band, the God of the whole earth; but all our unhappine&s;s ari&s;es from our alienation from him, and the further we pur&s;ue that path, the greater our mi&s;ery and calamity, whether we know the cau&s;e or not.</P>
<P>Now if the hu&s;band of the treacherou&s;ly departing wife, own her to be his wife, call after her to return, is willing and ready to receive her on her return, without upbraid|ing her, &s;he is certainly ble&s;&s;ed in a hu&s;band <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The go&s;pel, the Apo&s;tles preached was, 'that God was <HI>in</HI> Chri&s;t, reconciling the world unto him&s;elf, not imputing their tre&s;pa&s;&s;es unto them, 1 Corinthians, v, 19. Agreeable to the go&s;pel preached to Abraham, that' <HI>in</HI> thy &s;eed &s;hall all the nations of the earth be ble&s;&s;ed, Galatians, iii, 8, 16. The P&s;almi&s;t &s;aith, 'men &s;hall be ble&s;&s;ed <HI>in</HI> him, P&s;alm, lxxii, 17. The prophet &s;aith, 'the nations &s;hall ble&s;s them&s;elves <HI>in</HI> him, and <HI>in</HI> him &s;hall they glory,' Jeremiah, iv, 2. By the Apo&s;tle we are &s;aid to be 'cho&s;en <HI>in</HI> him,' Ephe&s;ians, i, 4. 'To be ju&s;tified <HI>in</HI> him, 1 Corinthians, vi, 11. 'To be ga|thered together <HI>in</HI> him.' Ephe&s;ians, i, 10. 'To be rooted and built up <HI>in</HI> him,' Collo&s;|&s;ians, ii, 7. 'To be &s;anctified <HI>in</HI> Chri&s;t Je&s;us,' 1 Corinthians, i, 2. 'To be ble&s;&s;ed with all &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings <HI>in</HI> Chri&s;t Je&s;us, Ephe&s;ians, i, 3. 'To be made to &s;it togethed in heavenly places, <HI>in</HI> Chri&s;t Je&s;us,' Ephe&s;ians, ii, 6. 'All the promi&s;es of God are <HI>in</HI> him, yea and <HI>in</HI> him amen.' 2 Corinthians, i, 20. 'And yea are compleat <HI>in</HI> him,' Collo&s;ians. ii. 10. 'And we are <HI>in</HI> him, that is true <HI>in</HI> his &s;on Je&s;us Chri&s;t,' 1 John, v, 20. Being ble&s;&s;ed <HI>in</HI> him, denotes union as members to their head 'all men being drawn to him when he was lifted up; and &s;o one dying for all, all died; he ta&s;ting death for every man.' Therefore this go&s;pel preached to Abraham, and preached by the Apo&s;tles is to he preached to tho&s;e that are the mo&s;t remote from ble&s;&s;edne&s;s in them&s;elves and when it is believed they are led to rejoice <HI>in</HI> Chri&s;t Je&s;us, though altogether de&s;titute in them&s;elves, unbelief and alienation, being the &s;ource of all our mi&s;ery, believing the truth as it is <HI>in</HI> Je&s;us, we &s;ee our ble&s;&s;edne&s;s <HI>in</HI> him.</NOTE> though &s;he for&s;akes her own mercies for lying vanities, and is mo&s;t forlorne and mi&s;erable in her&s;elf, while per&s;i&s;ting in her alienation,</P>
<P>I need only repeat two pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, to lead our minds from the &s;imilitude ju&s;t mentioned up to divine mercy. Jeremiah, iii, 1, 'but thou ha&s;t played the harlot
<PB N="9" REF="024860_0008_0FCD6BECC33D8F30">
with many lovers, yet return unto me &s;aith the Lord', ver&s;e 12, 'return thou back&s;liding I&s;rael, &s;aith the Lord, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is not return <HI>and</HI> I will not cau&s;e mine anger to fall upon you as a condition; the <HI>and</HI> is &s;upplied by the tran&s;lators, it is return I will not cau&s;e mine anger to fall upon you.</NOTE> I will not cau&s;e mine anger to fall upon you. I&s;aiah xlii, 22, 'I have blotted out as a thick cloud, thy tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, and as a cloud thy &s;ins; return unto me, for I have redeemed thee.' Thus go&s;pel mini&s;ters have the te&s;timony of God, by his Prophets, as well as the commi&s;&s;ion given to the Apo&s;tles, 'to preach the go&s;pel to every creature.'</P>
<P>2dly. It may be inquired, are not mini&s;ters to preach the law? An&s;wer, 'by the law is the knowledge of &s;in, for what things the law &s;aith, it &s;aith to them that are under the law, that every mouth may be &s;topped and all the world may become guilty before God, having no hope but in the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God, by faith of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, revealed in the go&s;pel.' The direction therefore, is 'to preach the go&s;|pel to every creature.'</P>
<P>There were &s;ome in the Apo&s;tles' day, that de&s;ired to be teachers of the law, under&s;tanding neither what they &s;ay nor whereof they affirm. The Apo&s;tle &s;ays, 'the law was our &s;chool-ma&s;ter unto, or until Chri&s;t,' (to bring us, is &s;up|plied by the tran&s;lators) 'that we might be ju&s;tified by faith; but when faith is come, we are no longer under a &s;chool-ma&s;ter.' When faith is come, that is when Chri&s;t is come, who is the object of faith, and hath &s;ent forth his &s;er|vants to preach the go&s;pel, which is called the hearing of faith: 'Received ye the &s;pirit by the works of the law,' or by the hearing of faith? That is by the hearing of the go&s;pel preached.</P>
<P>Objection. But doth not the &s;cripture &s;ay, 'cur&s;ed is every one that continueth not in all things written in the book of the law to do them?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. Yes, this is the language of the law, but the language of the go&s;pel is, 'Chri&s;t hath delivered us from the cur&s;e of the law, being made a cur&s;e for us,' and Chri&s;t's mini&s;ters are to preach the go&s;pel; perhaps &s;ome one will &s;ay, they are to preach it to the prepared &s;ubjects that are awakened by the terrors of the law, to &s;eek &s;alvation by Chri&s;t Je&s;us; they are to preach it to every creature, to tell every crea|ture 'Chri&s;t hath delivered us from the cur&s;e of the law,
<PB N="10" REF="024860_0009_0FCD6BED82D34058">
being made a cur&s;e for us.' To tell it as a truth; what! to unbelievers? Yes, to unbelievers; what con&s;titutes a man an unbeliever, but not believing the report of the go&s;pel. He that believeth this truth is &s;aved from the tormenting fear of the cur&s;e of the law, believing the report of the go&s;|pel; while he that doth not believe this truth, remains under &s;elf condemnation or damnation, being in his own apprehen&s;ion under the law, and under the cur&s;e: Man is denominated an unbeliever as not believing the truth.</P>
<P>If Chri&s;t's mini&s;ters wi&s;h to help unbelievers, let them keep clo&s;e to their direction, tell the truth that is to be be|lieved: Let them preach the 'mini&s;try of reconciliation, that God was <HI>in</HI> Chri&s;t reconciling the world unto him&s;elf, not imputing unto them their tre&s;pa&s;&s;es: That he hath made him &s;in for us, who knew no &s;in, that we might be made the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God <HI>in</HI> him,' and &s;et forth the eviden|ces of it in the re&s;urrection of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, from the dead, that if God plea&s;e to accompany the evidence to their minds, they may believe.</P>
<P>Earne&s;t repeated exhortations to believe, are lo&s;t, only tending to confu&s;e the mind that under&s;tands not what is to be believed, but when the truth to be believed, is under|&s;tood, and the evidences appear undeniable, it gains credit in the mind, and what we give full credit to is believed; therefore let the go&s;pel be preached to every creature, tell the good news even to unbelievers, for 'it is glad tidings of great joy to all people, tidings of a Saviour, which is Chri&s;t the Lord.'</P>
<P>3dly. Doth not the doctrine of election, militate with the go&s;pel's being preached to every creature? If the elect are only to obtain &s;alvation to the rejection or repro|bation of all others, how is it po&s;&s;ible to preach the go&s;pel to every creature?</P>
<P>For an&s;wer, it may be &s;aid, that this connecting of final re|jection or reprobation with the doctrine of election, has no foundation in the &s;criptures. Election among men, choo&s;es men to certain offices for the benefit of tho&s;e that are not elected; and if we con&s;ider election in the &s;en&s;e of the &s;criptures, it will appear that it is de&s;igned for the benefit of others. If we turn our attention, fir&s;t to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, it will lead our minds to I&s;aiah, xlii, 1, u&s;hered in with a note of
<PB N="11" REF="024860_0010_0FCD6BF463C86680">
attention 'behold! behold my &s;ervant whom I uphold, mine elect in whom my &s;oul delighteth,' why is Je&s;us Chri&s;t called God's elect, &s;ee ver&s;es, 6, 7, 'I the Lord have called thee in righteou&s;ne&s;s and will hold thine hard, and will keep thee and give the for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles, to open the blind eyes, to bring out the pri&s;oners from the pri&s;on, and them that &s;it in darkne&s;s out of the pri&s;on-hou&s;e.'</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. But is it not &s;aid in the &s;ame prophe&s;y, that he &s;hall be a '&s;tone of &s;tumbling and rock of offence to both hou&s;es of I&s;real;' and Peter '&s;peaks of him as a &s;tone of &s;tumbling and rock of offence, to them that &s;tumble at the word, being di&s;obedient, whereunto they were appointed.' Surely, Peter doth not intend to militate with the doctrine of 'the re&s;titution of all things, &s;poken of by the mouth of all God's holy Prophets &s;ince the world began,' their thus &s;tumbling, is to fulfil the purpo&s;e of God, 'who hath con|cluded them all in unbelief that he may have mercy on all, and thus open the blind eyes, and bring the pri&s;oners from the pri&s;on and tho&s;e that &s;it in darkne&s;s, out of the pri&s;on|hou&s;e.' Agreeable to the prophe&s;y of Simeon, in his addre&s;s to Mary, 'behold this child is &s;et for the fall and ri&s;ing again of many in I&s;rael, and for a &s;ign that &s;hall be &s;poken again&s;t.' The Apo&s;tles were cho&s;en witne&s;&s;es of the re|&s;urrection of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and &s;ent to the Jews; the 70 Di&s;|ciples were cho&s;en after, and &s;ent to the Gentiles, to every place whether he him&s;elf &s;hould come. 'The Apo&s;tles were cho&s;en to be Chri&s;t's witne&s;&s;es,' cho&s;en to this end, 'to go into all the world, and preach the go&s;pel to every creature;' Je&s;us Chri&s;t tells them, 'ye are the lights of the world;' lights are to guide travellers in the way; for this end, the 70 were cho&s;en and &s;ent forth. 'Tis expre&s;sly &s;aid of Paul, 'he is a cho&s;en ve&s;&s;el unto me, to bear my name before Gentiles and Kings; and the children of I&s;rael;' and this cho&s;en ve&s;&s;el was '&s;ent unto the Gentiles, to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkne&s;s to light, and from the power of &s;atan unto God.'</P>
<P>Which evidences that their election was for the benefit of others. Even in the xi of Romans, where the Apo&s;tle &s;peaking of the I&s;raelites &s;ays, 'the election hath obtained, and the re&s;t were blinded,' and &s;peaking of the &s;tumbling
<PB N="12" REF="024860_0011_0FCD6BF5C68FE6B0">
of the blinded, &s;aith, 'have they &s;tumbled, that they might fall; God forbid! and &s;hews it was to bring about the pur|po&s;es of God, re&s;pecting the Gentiles, which being accom|pli&s;hed, 'all Irael &s;hall be &s;aved as it is written;' and &s;peak|ing of the&s;e &s;tumbling Jews, he &s;aith 'as concerning the go&s;pel, they are enemies for your &s;akes, but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers &s;ake, for the gifts and calling of God are without repentance;' &s;hews them, 'concluded in unbelief, that God may have mercy on all.'</P>
<P>So when the Apo&s;tle, to the Ephe&s;ians &s;peaks of their be|ing prede&s;tinated to the adoption of children by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, according to the good plea&s;ure of his will, to the prai&s;e of his glory, he &s;hews the divine de&s;ign herein, that in the di&s;pen&s;ation of the fulne&s;s of time, he might gather to|gether in one, all things in Chri&s;t, both which are in Heaven and on earth in him.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The view that has been taken of election, being for the benefit of others, and not for their de&s;truction, might be illu&s;trated from the old te&s;tament &s;criptures. When it plea&s;ed God to &s;elect Abraham from among tho&s;e that &s;erved other gods, and ble&s;s him, others were not excluded, for his ble&s;&s;ing &s;hines mo&s;t illu&s;triou&s;ly in that part of it thus expre&s;&s;ed, in thy &s;eed &s;hall all the nations of the earth be ble&s;&s;ed. The choice of Mo&s;es and Aaron, the Levites the 70 Elders and the 12 princes, were all for the benefit of all I&s;rael, and the ble&s;&s;ing they enjoyed were conveyed to them, through the faithful attention of tho&s;e various characters and officers, to their appointments, by whom they were led forward to the typical re&s;t or land of Canaan. So are Gods elect under the go&s;pel di&s;pen|&s;ation cho&s;en as in&s;truments, in their places, to bring to view from the &s;criptures, the glad tidings of the go&s;pel, the wing Je&s;us as the way to the heavenly Canaan, the re&s;t that re|mains to the people of God, where the leaves of the tree of life &s;hall heal the nations, and there &s;hall be no more cur&s;e but the throne of God and the Lamb, &s;hall be in it, and his &s;ervants &s;hall &s;erve him and they &s;hall &s;ee his face agreeable to the prayer of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, John, xvii, 24, 'father, I will, that they al&s;o whom thou ha&s;t given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory.'</NOTE></P>
<P>It is &s;aid by the Apo&s;tle James, 'of his own will begat he us, by the word of truth that we might be a kind of fir&s;t fruits of his creatures;' now the fir&s;t fruits are not the whole harve&s;t, only an earne&s;t of it, as we &s;ee by 'the hun|dred forty and four thou&s;and, that are &s;ealed in the Reve|lations, and &s;tand with the Lamb on the mount Zion, with the harps of God,' the&s;e fir&s;t fruits are the 'elect redeem|ed from among men, that follow the lamb, whether&s;oever he goeth.</P>
<P>Now it is ob&s;ervable both in the 7th and 14th chapters, that the &s;ealed, the first fruits, or the elect, were not the whole of the &s;aved; for the hundred forty-four thou&s;and &s;ealed, being mentioned, we read in the 9th ver&s;e, 'after this I beheld, and lo a

great multitude which no man could number, of all nations and kindreds, and people, and tongues, &s;tood before the Throne, and before the Lamb cloathed with white robes, and palms in their hands, and cried &s;alvation to our God, and to the Lamb.'</P>
<P>This was &s;o wonderful, to &s;ee this innumerable multi|tude, be&s;ide the &s;ealed, the elect, the fir&s;t fruits, that the inquiry is, what are the&s;e and whence come they? The an|&s;wer is, 'the&s;e are they that come out of great tribulation, and have wa&s;hed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb, therefore are they before the throne, &amp;c. The&s;e are they that came out of great tribulation: What greater tribulation can we &s;uppo&s;e, can be&s;al the children of men, than what ari&s;es from an apprehen&s;ion of a po&s;&s;ibility of being reprobated to eternal damnation? And being on this account, all their lifetime &s;ubject to bon|dage through fear of death; for &s;uch to find them&s;elves be|fore the throne, in virtue of the blood of the Lamb, no wonder they cry with a loud voice, &s;alvation, &amp;c. no won|der they feel their obligations to &s;erve him day and night in his temple, 'having him that &s;itteth on the throne, to dwell among them, delivered from hungering or thir&s;ting any more, and having God to wipe away all tears from their eyes.' If we look into the 14th chapter, after the de&s;crip|tion of the hundred forty-four thou&s;and, &s;tanding with the Lamb, on the mount Zion, with the harps of God, and &s;inging the new &s;ong, we find ver&s;e 6, another angel 'fly in the mid&s;t of Heaven, having the everla&s;ting go&s;pel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth; even to every nation tongue, and people:' Thus I think if the doctrine of election were rightly under&s;tood, it can be no objection to preaching the go&s;pel to every creature.</P>

Is not the preaching the go&s;pel, included in Paul's exhortation to Timothy, 'my &s;on be &s;trong in the grace, that is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us;' the &s;ame Apo&s;tle tells us what this grace is, 'ye know the grace of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who though he was rich for our &s;akes, became poor, that we through his poverty might be rich;' this is the grace made manife&s;t in the go&s;pel, the tidings of it are to be told to every creature; this is the grace whereby we &s;erve God acceptably, which our Apo&s;tle exhorts to hold fa&s;t, we re|ceiving a kingdom which cannot be moved; we read it, let us have grace, but the margin reads it agreeable to the original, 'let us hold fa&s;t the grace whereby we may &s;erve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear,' for our God is a con&s;uming fire; every thing in the &s;ervice of God, that hath not re&s;pect to the grace that is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, is wood, hay, &s;tubble, and mu&s;t be burnt up.</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle Peter drawing to a clo&s;e in his fir&s;t Epi&s;tle, &s;peaking of what he had been writing, &s;ays, 'I have written briefly, exhorting and te&s;tifying that this is the true grace of God, wherein ye &s;tand;' if we look back into the Epi&s;tle, we find him writing of the grace, that is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who his own&s;elf bear our &s;ins in his own body on the tree, for Chri&s;t hath once &s;uffered the ju&s;t for the unju&s;t, that he might bring us to God, by who&s;e &s;tripes ye were healed.

<P>The &s;criptures te&s;tify of Chri&s;t, both in the law of Mo&s;es, the Prophets, and the Plalms: The great error of many preachers, has centred in their apprehen&s;ion, that the &s;crip|tures te&s;tified of good men, and in proportion as this error has prevailed, we have heard of the virtue and piety of Abraham, David, the Prophets, and other pious men, whom we have been excited to follow, in hope of the divine favor, if we could come to their attainments; but the light di&s;covers this to be a &s;pecies of idolatry, putting the Creature in the place of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, or at lea&s;t between us and him, while the go&s;pel calls us 'to behold the Lamb of God, that taketh away the &s;in of the world.' The light di&s;covering this error, in the place of it, their has crept in, perhaps a more undi&s;cernable one, when preachers have been led to &s;peak excellently of the character and fini&s;hed work of Chri&s;t, they have known &s;omething el&s;e be&s;ides Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and him crucified, having a great part of their di&s;cour&s;es, taken up about the excellency of believers, their experiences, attainments, devotions in their clo&s;ets and families, and at public wor&s;hip, and in their conduct in moral civil life, to the flattering of their pride and importance, cau&s;ing them to conceive them&s;elves the chief of &s;aints, to the aba&s;ement of tho&s;e that have not the&s;e attainments. But let it be con&s;idered whether it would not be more advan|tageous to the believers of the go&s;pel, as well as nearer their pattern, if they were put in mind of the various apo&s;tolic exhortations to them, and put upon inquiring how much cau&s;e they have for &s;hame and humiliation, that the&s;e ex|hortations have &s;o little influence on their minds and con|duct, which if attended to with &s;obriety of mind, would tend to excite them, to take rank with the chief of &s;inners,

and to glorify God for mercy, upon a level with the vile&s;t. Such preachers as are above de&s;cribed, draw the minds of their hearers from the one object, having two to pre&s;ent before them; whereas the Prophet I&s;aiah, propo&s;es one ob|ject, 'the glory of the Lord &s;hall be revealed, and all fle&s;h &s;hall &s;ee together. Look unto me and be &s;aved, all the ends of the earth.' John &s;ays, 'behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the &s;in of the world;' and Paul deter|mines to know nothing among them, &s;ave Je&s;us Chri&s;t and him crucifyed. Let Peter clo&s;e with his te&s;timony of Chri&s;t, as recorded in his 1&s;t Epi&s;tle, 2d chapter, 24 ver&s;e, 'who his own&s;elf, bear our &s;ins in his own body on the tree, that we being dead to &s;in, might live to righteou&s;ne&s;s, by who&s;e &s;tripes ye were healed.'</P>
<P>Should the mind of any, &s;ugge&s;t the old objection, to preaching the go&s;pel to every creature, that was brought in the Apo&s;tle's days and is kept up, down to our day, that it endangers morality, and will excite to continue in &s;in, that grace may abound.</P>
<P>It may be an&s;wered, that the morality of the go&s;pel is founded on divine love, both by Je&s;us Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;|tles; when Je&s;us Chri&s;t gave the golden rule as it is de|&s;ervedly called, it was founded on the love of God, &s;et forth in a mo&s;t &s;triking figure, 'what man is there of you, who if his &s;on a&s;k bread will he give him a &s;tone?' Is there &s;uch a man <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> you that are evil, prone to covetou&s;ne&s;s, anger and various other evils? Is there one among you who if his &s;on a&s;k bread will he give him a &s;tone, and thus mock his hunger? What heart, among you that are evil, can do this? If ye then being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more &s;hall your father who is in Heaven, give good things to them that a&s;k him? There|fore all things what&s;oever ye would, that men &s;hould do to you, do ye even &s;o to them; you never need defraud or over-reach one another, to obtain any good you may think you want, becau&s;e your heavenly father is more rea|dy to give good things to them that a&s;k him, than the be&s;t of you are to give bread to your children; let his love con|&s;train you in all things, to do one to another, as ye would they &s;hould do to you; when Je&s;us bid his Di&s;ciples love their enemies, he gave the example in his love to them.</P>

<P>The morality of the go&s;pel is founded on divine love by the Apo&s;tles; they preached the go&s;pel to every creature, tho&s;e who were gathered to the faith of the go&s;pel, they collected into churches, and taught them to ob&s;erve all things what&s;oever Je&s;us Chri&s;t commanded; they exhorted, comforted, and charged every one of them, as a father doth his children, that they would walk worthy of God, who hath called them to his kingdom and glory. Let any one, who&s;e mind is concerned about the preaching of the go&s;pel to every creature, endangering morality, look over the Epi&s;tles, wrote to the churches, collected by preaching the go&s;pel, and they will &s;ee in the former parts of the&s;e Epi&s;tles, the riches of divine grace, contained in the doc|trine of Chri&s;t, then, the obligations the Di&s;ciples are under to adorn this doctrine, in their lives and conver&s;ations in the various places and relations that they &s;u&s;tain; that they which have believed in God, be careful to maintain good works, not merely to talk of them, with approbation, but be at the co&s;t of maintaining them. If the&s;e things be &s;oberly attended to, it will appear to any impartial inquir|er, that the intere&s;t of morality is not endangered by preach|ing the go&s;pel to every creature.</P>
<P>Having inquired who Archipus was, and what was the mini&s;try he received in the Lord; the next inquiry is, in what manner is this mini&s;try thus received of the Lord, to be delivered to the people. The an&s;wer to this inquiry is
<PB N="18" REF="024860_0017_0FCD6C025B4406B8">
given by the Apo&s;tle. 'Not with wi&s;dom of words lea&s;t the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t &s;hould be made of none effect,' 1&s;t of Co|rinthians, xvii, to the end. 'And I brethren when I came to you, came not with excellency of &s;peech or of wi&s;dom, declaring unto you the te&s;timony of God, for I determined not to know any thing among you, &s;ave Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and him crucified,' 1&s;t of Corinthians, ii, 1 to 5, 'And my &s;peech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wi&s;dom, but in demon&s;tration of the &s;pirit and of power, now we have received not the &s;pirit of the world, but the &s;pirit which is of God, that we may know the things that are freely given us of God, which things we &s;peak, not in the words which man's wi&s;dom teacheth, but which the Holy Gho&s;t teacheth, comparing &s;piritual things with &s;piritual.' Ver&s;es 12, 13. That is, I conceive comparing the types and prophe&s;yes of the old te&s;tament, with their fulfilment in the antitype, as recorded in the new.</P>
<P>If it &s;hould be inquired, why were the Apo&s;tles of Chri&s;t thus cautious to &s;hun the enticing words of man's wi&s;dom? the two rea&s;ons the Apo&s;tle gives, may be brought as an an&s;wer; the fir&s;t, the corruption of the doctrine of Chri&s;t, in the&s;e words, 'not with wi&s;dom of words, lea&s;t the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t &s;hould be made of none effect, the preaching of the cro&s;s, or of Chri&s;t crucifyed, is to the Jew a &s;tumbling-|block, and to the Greek fooli&s;hne&s;s,' now there have not been wanting tho&s;e who &s;ought by wi&s;dom of words, to make the offence of the cro&s;s cea&s;e from the Apo&s;tles days down to our own. The fal&s;e teachers in the Apo&s;tles days, laboured to reconcile the &s;tumbling Jew to the go&s;pel, by adding the ceremonies of the law, teaching the Gentile be|lievers, 'except they be circumci&s;ed after the manner of Mo&s;es, they cannot be &s;aved, making by their wi&s;dom, the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, of none effect,' for &s;aith the Apo&s;tle, 'who|&s;oever is circumci&s;ed, he is a debtor to do the whole law, Chri&s;t is become of none effect,' &s;eeking thus to be ju&s;tified by the law, they fall from the grace of the go&s;pel. The fal&s;e teachers from the Apo&s;tles days to our own, have in like manner &s;tudied by wi&s;dom of words, to reconcile the doctrine of Chri&s;t, to the wi&s;e Greek, who held it fooli&s;h to build the hope of &s;alvation on Chri&s;t crucifyed, as the
<PB N="19" REF="024860_0018_0FCD6C0342B6F628">
only exclu&s;ive foundation; &s;aying it is fooli&s;h for an un|godly &s;inner, to look for justification by the work of Chri&s;t, unle&s;s he have repentance, faith, obedience, &amp;c. which are brought in as props to the work of Chri&s;t, as though it were not alone all &s;ufficient; faith, as it is thus con&s;idered, is not the belief of the go&s;pel, which reports our ble&s;&s;edne&s;s in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, but is &s;omething we mu&s;t have wrought in us, or exerci&s;ed by us, in order to our being intere&s;ted there|in. Repentance as it is thus con&s;idered, is not a turning from our&s;elves, and all creature dependence, where we have been &s;eeking life, to Chri&s;t who is our life; but is a certain &s;orrow, for our open heinous, and even &s;ecret &s;ins, to quali|fy us for obtaining forgivene&s;s by Chri&s;t Je&s;us. Obedi|ence is likewi&s;e con&s;idered a nece&s;&s;ary qualification for our acceptance; not as a te&s;timony of our gratitude, that he hath made us accepted in the beloved.</P>
<P>And in this mi&s;taken view, faith, repentance and obedi|ance, being added to the work of Chri&s;t, are calculated to bring the doctrine to the wi&s;dom of the Greek, who always &s;uppo&s;e God will be propitious to the believing penitent and obedient. Every &s;pecies of fal&s;e religion, of what ever name or denomination, will agree here, while every true chri&s;tian will agree with the Apo&s;tle, that it is<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">And will break out with the Prophet Micah, who is a God like unto thee that pardoneth iniquity.</NOTE> a faith|ful &s;aying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Je&s;us came to &s;ave &s;inners, of whom I am chief; but that Chri&s;t came to &s;eek and &s;ave that which was lo&s;t, died for the ungodly, came to &s;ave &s;inners, even the chief, will not do to men|tion alone, it is too weak and fooli&s;h.</P>
<P>It is true, &s;ay they, that Chri&s;t came to &s;ave that which was lo&s;t, and no &s;inner will mi&s;carry, who &s;eek him &s;incere|ly, earne&s;tly and per&s;everingly; but the text &s;ays, 'he came to &s;eek and to &s;ave that which was lo&s;t,' 'tis true &s;ay they, 'Chri&s;t died for the ungodly,' and all of that di&s;cription &s;hall be benefited thereby, that will come to him; but they will not come that they may have life; but read the text, 'my people &s;hall be willing in the day of my power.'</P>
<P>Yes &s;ay they, but who are his people, who are given to him? Let the &s;criptures an&s;wer, 'the father loveth the &s;on, and hath given all things into his hands, he hath given

the heathen his inheritance, and the utmo&s;t parts of the earth, his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and all that the father giveth, &s;hall come.'</P>
<P>Thus we have contemplated how the wi&s;dom of words, is employed, to endeavor to take away the &s;tumbling block from the Jew, and the imputation of fooli&s;hne&s;s from the Greek; and that every attempt of this kind, is making the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t of none effect. The &s;econd rea&s;on, the Apo&s;tle draws from the effects on the hearers; where the doctrine of Chri&s;t is maintained, there &s;hould be a con&s;tant care to u&s;e great plaine&s;s of &s;peech, becau&s;e the poor have the go&s;pel preached to them, and if it is preached in lan|guage above their capacity, although it may be very good, and ea&s;y to be under&s;tood by the learned, yet if there come in one that is unlearned, how &s;hall he &s;ay Amen, at thy giving thanks, &s;eeing he under&s;tandeth not what thou &s;ay|e&s;t; except (&s;ays the Apo&s;tle) ye utter by the tongue, words ea&s;y to be under&s;tood, how &s;hall it be known what is &s;pok|en, for ye &s;hall &s;peak unto the air; and he &s;ays I had rather &s;peak five words with my under&s;tanding, that I might teach others al&s;o, than ten thou&s;and words in an unknown tongue.</P>
<P>Although tongues have cea&s;ed, yet the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions of the Apo&s;tle, may at this day be improved as a guard again&s;t language above common capacities and when &s;uch lan|guage is familiar by u&s;e, to any of the preachers of the go&s;|pel, &s;uch would do well to attend the exhortation of the Apo&s;tle, let him that &s;peaks in an unknown tongue, pray that he may interpret; let him pray that he may be able to come to the capacity of the mo&s;t unlearned of his hearers, when preaching the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t; it &s;eems as if this was what the Apo&s;tle meant, by &s;aying, 'brethren be not children in under&s;tanding, in under&s;tanding be men,' as it immediately follows his &s;aying, he had rather &s;peak five words with his under&s;tanding that he might teach others, than ten thou&s;and that could not be under&s;tood; for &s;aith he, if I know not the meaning of the voice, I &s;hall be to him that &s;peaketh a barbarian, and he that &s;peaketh, a bar|barian unto me.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, the Apo&s;tle appears to aim at inculcat|ing the delivering of the go&s;pel with plainne&s;s of &s;peech
<PB N="21" REF="024860_0020_0FCD6C070B649870">
for the above rea&s;ons, which appear weighty and worthy of attention; and &s;ays, '&s;eeing then we have &s;uch hope we u&s;e great plainne&s;s of &s;peech, and not as Mo&s;es, who put a veil over his face;' and in another place neither of men &s;ought we glory, neither of you nor of others.</P>
<P>Let go&s;pel mini&s;ters imitate the Apo&s;tle herein, let them attend the expre&s;s declaration of &s;cripture, both of the old and new te&s;tament, that unite to publi&s;h &s;alvation, to the end of the earth, and to the evidences of the truth of the&s;e glad tidings, of great joy to all people; that being con|vinced of the truth of this good news, they may tell it as a truth to their hearers, even to unbelievers, in as plain, in|telligible a manner as may be, that if it plea&s;e God to ac|company the truth with divine evidence, they may believe, and believing have life through his name.</P>
<P>Let the hearers, who&s;e minds are at a lo&s;s about the truth of the go&s;pel, bend their attention to the &s;earch of the &s;crip|tures after the example of the Bereans, to &s;ee if the&s;e things are &s;o.</P>
<P>And tho&s;e that are &s;atisfied of the truth, from &s;cripture evidence, abound in thank&s;giving for the manife&s;tation of the exceeding riches of the grace appearing therein, and make it their con&s;tant &s;tudy to live as the grace of God, which hath appeared, which bringeth &s;alvation to all men, teacheth, viz. 'denying ungodline&s;s and worldly lu&s;ts, and to live &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly and godly in the world, looking for the ble&s;&s;ed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Savior Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who gave him&s;elf for our &s;ins, that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto him&s;elf a peculiar people zealous of good works.'</P>
<P>Let the words of the Apo&s;tle Peter clo&s;e, 'if any man &s;peak, let him &s;peak as the oracles of God, if any man mini&s;ter, let him do it as of the ability, that God giveth; that God in all things may be glorified through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to whom be prai&s;e and dominion forever,</P>
