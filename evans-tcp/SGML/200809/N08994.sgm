<HEAD>PREFACE BY THE EDITOR.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH the u&s;efulne&s;s of PREACHING is univer&s;ally acknowledged among Chri|&s;tians, yet we find they differ in opinion with regard to the manner of performing it, and the qualifica|tions nece&s;&s;ary to the preacher. A man is generally required to go through <HI>a cour&s;e of learning at a col|lege or an academy</HI> before he be admitted to the mini|&s;terial office; which done, his u&s;ual method of in|&s;tructing others, is, by <HI>reading in public a di&s;cour&s;e previou&s;ly &s;tudied and penned in private.</HI> But there are &s;ome who think that <HI>a good life and conver&s;ation,</HI> and <HI>a &s;incere heart,</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;ted by <HI>a divine influence,</HI> though not accompanied with the knowledge of the learned languages, are &s;ufficient to con&s;titute a mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel; and that the be&s;t and mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful in&s;tructions are delivered <HI>without any pre|meditation of the preacher,</HI> when under &s;uch a con|cern of mind as would render his &s;ilence incon|&s;i&s;tent with his duty. This la&s;t is well known to be the opinion of the people called QUAKERS; and I mu&s;t acknowledge my&s;elf to be of the &s;ame &s;entiment.</P>
<P>'TIS commonly objected, that an <HI>extempore</HI> preacher mu&s;t needs be liable to frequent inaccura|cies of expre&s;&s;ion; that his language is &s;eldom gram|matical; that it is very difficult for him to avoid tau|tologies,
<PB N="iv" REF="011483_0004_0F832E4FD508D788">
and to ob&s;erve that method and coherence which are nece&s;&s;ary to the beauty of a di&s;cour&s;e, &amp;c.</P>
<P>THESE objections I allow to be true, as to the matter of fact; but of &s;mall weight when the ten|dency and de&s;ign of preaching are con&s;idered; which being to inform the <HI>mind,</HI> has no further re|gard to the <HI>ear,</HI> &s;trictly &s;peaking, than what is ne|ce&s;&s;ary towards being under&s;tood.&mdash;Not that I de|ny or de&s;pi&s;e the beauties of language, and the force of eloquence, or believe the QUAKERS le&s;s &s;en&s;ible of them than others are; but as the amend|ment of the heart is, or ought to be, principally in the preacher's view, they think a ca&s;ual &s;lip of ex|pre&s;&s;ion very excu&s;able, while his meaning is obvious to &s;uch as give a proper attention.</P>
<P>PLAINNESS of language in a preacher is certainly mo&s;t agreeable to the &s;implicity of the go&s;pel, however it may be rediculed by tho&s;e who will not give them&s;elves time to con&s;ider the nature of Chri|&s;tianity, or by tho&s;e who endeavour to make every thing my&s;terious in religion, in order to &s;erve their own private purpo&s;es. It is likewi&s;e mo&s;t &s;uitable to the capacities of mankind in general: <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 span"> believe it will hardly be denied, that a <HI>plain <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> di&s;cour&s;e is preferable to a <HI>learned &s;peculative</HI> only if it be con&s;idered, that the former may be of <HI>uni|ver&s;al</HI> benefit, whereas the latter can be profitable (or rather plea&s;ing) only to a <HI>few.</HI></P>
<P>AS I hinted before, I would not be under&s;tood to blame or depreciate the accompli&s;hments of <HI>learn|ing</HI> and <HI>eloquence:</HI> They are certainly <HI>ornaments</HI> to any man, and more e&s;pecially to a preacher. But though the QUAKERS e&s;teem the&s;e qualifications as <HI>u&s;eful,</HI> yet becau&s;e they deny them to be ab&s;olutely <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> and <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> to a <HI>go&s;pel mini&s;ter,</HI> they have been condemned as de&s;pi&s;ers of <HI>&s;cience,</HI> and ob&s;tinate
<PB N="v" REF="011483_0005_0F832E509B3BDCE0">
encouragers of <HI>ignorance,</HI> even in their teachers, in whom knowledge ought mo&s;t to abound. Which wrong notion has &s;o much prevailed, that men of tolerable capacities will enter their meetings with a contemptuous &s;mile; and, as they come with a full expectation of hearing nothing but <HI>non&s;en&s;e,</HI> are very unwilling to own them&s;elves di&s;appointed.</P>
<P>I AM far from in&s;inuating, by what I have &s;aid, that the following di&s;cour&s;es are offered to the world as a &s;pecimen of uncommon learning and eloquence; they being neither preached with a view of being made public, nor at fir&s;t taken down with that in|tent: Nor are they cho&s;e on account of their excel|ling the di&s;cour&s;es generally delivered by the &s;ame per&s;on; for, as they were &s;poken without the par|ticular de&s;ign of publication, it is improbable they &s;hould contain any particular excellencies.</P>
<P>WHEN they were tran&s;cribed from the &s;hort-hand, and &s;hewn to &s;everal friends who heard them, they appeared &s;o full of &s;ound doctrine and argument, that it was thought they might bear printing, with a few trifling alterations; which were accordingly made, agreeably to what the author and &s;ome of the auditors could recollect of their fir&s;t &s;hape; he declining to alter them in any other re&s;pect, that they might keep their genuine &s;implicity, notwith|&s;tanding a few in&s;ignificant &s;lips that may po&s;&s;ibly have e&s;caped him.</P>
<P>AS the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es are offered to the public as they were fir&s;t delivered by one engaged in a pretty con|&s;tant cour&s;e of preaching, without any other de&s;ign than the edification of his hearers, and publi&s;h|ed with little or no improvement, the allowance which is natural on the&s;e accounts will, I believe, be as much indulgence as they will &s;tand in need of in the eyes of the judicious.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="011483_0006_0F832E5186DA8FF8">BEFORE I conclude, I cannot help ob&s;erving, with much plea&s;ure, how &s;uperior the&s;e are, even in their pre&s;ent form, to many &s;ermons which are daily publi&s;hed by men who have &s;pent a number of years in &s;tudying the art of making them, and who never produce one without labour and mature deliberation.&mdash;In di&s;cour&s;es offered by &s;uch men, faults are much le&s;s excu&s;able, it being the profe&s;|&s;ed bu&s;ine&s;s of their lives to avoid them; great part of which is a&s;&s;igned to the &s;tudy of a &s;cience unknown to the fir&s;t promulgators of the go&s;pel, that of our <HI>&s;chool-divinity;</HI> which has been of very little &s;ervice to mankind, unle&s;s by introducing a va&s;t number of &s;ubtle and perplexing di&s;tinctions, unintelligable definitions, and &s;uch-like &s;tuff, where|in &s;ome of the mo&s;t famous modern preachers are peculiarly &s;killed; but which can never in the lea&s;t promote the main de&s;ign of Chri&s;tianity, <HI>the putting an end to &s;in, and the introducing of righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>I HAVE nothing more to add, than my earne&s;t wi&s;h, that the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es may be read with cool|ne&s;s, and without prejudice or partiality; and that the divine ble&s;&s;ing may attend the peru&s;al of them, which alone can make them effectual to an&s;wer the de&s;ign of the preacher, and the de&s;ire of</P>

<HEAD>THE NATURE and NECESSITY OF Knowing ONE's-SELF.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A <HI>DISCOURSE</HI> delivered at the Meeting-Hou&s;e in <HI>Gracechurch-&s;treet, LONDON,</HI> <DATE><HI>June 12, 1737.</HI></DATE></HEAD>
<P>I HAVE in remembrance a very &s;hort pre|cept of a man of under&s;tanding, though not under the character of a <HI>Jew</HI> or <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> which, I think, may be well worthy of the no|tice of every one here; and it is this:
<Q>Know Thy&s;elf.</Q>
There is not a more u&s;eful knowledge than this, except the knowledge of God; and if we do not know our&s;elves, how &s;hall we know the Lord? I have ob&s;erved, as I &s;at in &s;ilence, wait|ing upon God in this meeting, that all matter is created of God, as well that which is inert and lifele&s;s, as the living creatures; and all matter that we are acquainted with revolves from form to form, but there is no annihilation of any.</P>
<P>THE plants of the earth ob&s;erve a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion from age to age: From &s;mall &s;eeds they &s;pring up, and proceed from &s;tature to &s;tature, after their kinds, till they arrive at the perfections a&s;&s;igned them; and then al&s;o they gradually decline, and others take place from their &s;eeds, and as their offspring.</P>
<P>THE living creatures al&s;o ob&s;erve the laws pre|&s;cribed them; after their manner producing their
<PB N="8" REF="011483_0008_0F832E52DDEE79C0">
own &s;pecies, which renew, increa&s;e, decrea&s;e, and &s;ucceed, from generation to generation, as the others do; &s;o that there is no certain continuance of any particular.</P>
<P>THE next thing I have in view is, the very low &s;tate in which we mortals are fir&s;t produced into this world. In that &s;tate we have no knowledge, no under&s;tanding, but are like the bea&s;ts of the field, and other animals, or even more helple&s;s than they, and incapable of any law but that of nature, which we cannot break.</P>
<P>AND, being endued with five &s;en&s;es, we grow up by imperceptible gradations in the u&s;e of them, and proceed from &s;tature to &s;tature, and &s;trength to &s;trength, both of body and mind, to the degrees of which we are &s;everally capable, as variou&s;ly circum|&s;tanced, for we are not alike in either.</P>
<P>THE mind, dwelling in the body, could never perceive, or apprehend, the things that are without, or have any knowledge of them, but by the &s;en&s;es, through the organs of the body adapted to that end. The mind within by the&s;e begins to take notice of things without; and every creature and thing, that we &s;ee and ob&s;erve, exhibits its own idea to the &s;en&s;e; and as we grow up, more objects are frequently pre&s;ented, and the mind which hears, &s;ees, ta&s;tes, &s;mells, and handles, by the organs of the body, gradually becomes more and more furni&s;hed with ideas, which, in time, it is enabled to collate and compare; and as the under&s;tanding is by this means enlarged, it now begins to attend to cau&s;es and their effects, and to form &s;ome conjuctures of the why and why not of things, whence they are, why they are thus, and not otherwi&s;e: And as they differ in their forms, &s;o likewi&s;e in their natures, virtues, and ends, it is the mind and under&s;tanding, being
<PB REF="011483_0009_0F832E53939E08A0">
informed of the outward creation by the &s;en&s;es, that deduces this con&s;equence from tho&s;e premi&s;es; that they, and we our&s;elves al&s;o, mu&s;t have an au|thor of our being, all-wi&s;e, almighty, eternal and all-good, holy, righteous, ju&s;t, and true, wor|thy above all to be &s;ought after, known, loved, feared, honoured and obeyed. Yet as our fir&s;t &s;tate in this world is only animal, before we arrive at a competent degree of con&s;ideration and under&s;tand|ing, or knowledge of our&s;elves, or value of our im|mortal &s;ouls; we are by the perpetual pre&s;ence of objects adapted to our &s;en&s;es, and a natural propen|&s;ity to pur&s;ue the &s;ight of the eye, the hearing of the ear, and the delights which the other &s;en&s;es, &s;eated in the natural mind and corporeal frame, can afford, and which are the chief good and of the highe&s;t e&s;teem in our view, as not having yet ta&s;ted of any thing of a &s;uperior nature or kind; we are by the&s;e (I &s;ay) &s;o &s;trongly habituated and bia&s;&s;ed to the pur&s;uit of the&s;e objects (though mo&s;t un|worthy of our pains) that we are apt to proceed in this manner, without a due &s;earch into our&s;elves, what we are, and why we were created, and pro|duced here in this world, and by whom, and what the proper end of our being, as if to no other pur|po&s;e but to gratify our &s;en&s;es, and live in &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ures and delights, as others the lower animals do, and like the brutes of the field, which feed on the fruits by the roots of the trees, and re&s;t under their &s;hades, and never look up to &s;ee whence the food and &s;helter come, or con&s;ider their own being and end.</P>
<P>THUS the generality of mankind live, for a time, in this pre&s;ent world. Whil&s;t in this manner of being, they live and die, and are never acquainted with them&s;elves: But he that perfectly knows him|&s;elf,
<PB N="10" REF="011483_0010_0F832E545B226D28">
perceives that man is an abridgement of the whole creation of God, and has made a great &s;tep towards knowing it. But if we are not able rightly to know our&s;elves, how &s;hould we come to the knowledge of the mo&s;t high, our creator? And if we could know all the creation, and anatomize every part of the matter of it, and di&s;tinctly account for the manner of its cohe&s;ion and exi&s;tence, and knew all that is po&s;&s;ible to be known of it, and had all the knowledge of the angels of God in heaven; though the knowledge and contemplation of things in the mind and under&s;tanding affords an intellec|tual plea&s;ure, &s;uperior to that of the &s;en&s;es; yet all this would not render us compleatly happy, even in this pre&s;ent world; we may live and die unhap|py notwith&s;tanding: Neither would the gratifying of all our &s;en&s;es and appetites, if without account and with impunity, alter the ca&s;e at all.</P>
<P>WE pur&s;ue, with diligence, tho&s;e objects which promi&s;e us delight in the views we have of them at a di&s;tance; but when obtained, though with diffi|culty and hazard, and enjoyed, they do not an&s;wer the expectations we have formed, in our imagina|tions concerning them; but peri&s;h with the u&s;ing, and we are di&s;appointed. It is therefore mo&s;t pro|per that, as rea&s;onable creatures, we pur&s;ue that &s;atisfaction, and tho&s;e things, which are real, per|manent, and everla&s;ting.</P>
<P>WHAT is that, therefore, which makes mankind everla&s;tingly happy, and gives him full &s;atisfaction? It is the knowledge of the creator of all things; of the true and living God, and not of the things that are made only. And it is the Lord him&s;elf that, in infinite goodne&s;s and mercy, &s;o qualifies the hearts and minds of mankind, that we are made capable of knowing him, and of being united to
<PB N="11" REF="011483_0011_0F832E5515F54AC8">
him, and enjoying him, through that ble&s;&s;ed medi|um which he, in his divine wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s, hath been plea&s;ed to prepare.</P>
<P>AND all that are come to any competent degree of under&s;tanding, thinking and con&s;ideration, may conclude, that &s;ince the creator hath produced and appointed &s;ome things agreeable unto us, as his creatures, in which we have great plea&s;ure and de|light, lawful and allowable, as objects and &s;ubjects both of our &s;en&s;es and under&s;tandings; how much greater plea&s;ure and &s;atisfaction, and more perma|nent and certain, mu&s;t there be, in the knowledge and enjoyment of the creator him&s;elf, who is the root and fulne&s;s of all divine plea&s;ure un&s;peakable, and endureth unchangeably for ever.</P>
<P>THE &s;en&s;ible plea&s;ures created of God, and given unto man in this life (not the fal&s;e and counter|feit ones forged by man) though agreeable to his nature and &s;tate, and ju&s;tly and rea&s;onably propor|tioned and bounded, are but for a &s;hort &s;ea&s;on, and attended with &s;uch degrees of alloy as often ren|der them null: But when God is plea&s;ed &s;o to qualify the mind of man, that the creator him&s;elf becomes the chief, if not only, object of his love, de&s;ire, and contemplation; then man finds in the Lord all that his heart could de&s;ire or think, and more abundantly, according to a &s;aying of an ex|perienced man of God;
<Q>eye hath not &s;een (&s;aid he) nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath pre|pared for them that love him.</Q>
And if we love God, we &s;hall likewi&s;e love mankind in the &s;ame love; for I remember what an apo&s;tle of the Lord Chri&s;t &s;aid, treating on that &s;ubject,
<Q>if a man loveth not his brother, whom he hath &s;een, how &s;hall he love God, whom he hath not &s;een?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="011483_0012_0F832E579A2D9578">NOW what way, and by what means, &s;hall we mortals attain to this experimental knowledge of God, &s;o needful and de&s;irable, as the perfection and e&s;tabli&s;hment of our being? For when we look upon the heavens and the earth, and things that therein are, &s;o far as we can behold them, rea&s;oning from the effects to the cau&s;e, we conclude that <HI>he is,</HI> and that he is the cau&s;e of all things, and we cannot do otherwi&s;e as rational beings. And contemplat|ing God, we mu&s;t needs determine, as intelligent creatures, that he hath all tho&s;e divine attributes we commonly attribute unto him; as that he is an eternal, incomprehen&s;ible &s;pirit, or mind, omnipre|&s;ent, omni&s;cient, almighty, all-good, and unchange|able: And that he hath all tho&s;e moral characters u&s;ually a&s;cribed to him in the holy &s;criptures, as righteou&s;ne&s;s, holine&s;s, ju&s;tice, mercy, truth, faith|fulne&s;s: Where al&s;o, after the manner of men, even the affections and pa&s;&s;ions of mortals are a&s;cribed to him, as anger, hatred, fury, revenge, jealou&s;y; as al&s;o coporeal parts and &s;hapes, as head, arms, hands, feet; whereas tho&s;e human properties and parts, (con&s;idered as in men) are not really and formally in God, but in the creatures by whom he worketh.</P>
<P>BUT though the earth &s;ets forth his handy work, and the heavens his power and glory; and though the holy &s;criptures report of the mo&s;t high tho&s;e things that are true, yet all this (as to us mortals) is but as an hi&s;torical account, or a report; for we &s;till remain, in point of experience, ignorant of him of whom it is thus declared, though we have be|lieved it as we ought. We are at a di&s;tance &s;till; there is a va&s;t cha&s;m, and as a fixed gulf between the creator and us, all the&s;e things notwith&s;tanding.</P>
<P>THE &s;cripture declares, as from the mouth of Chri&s;t, that God is a &s;pirit, and we believe it;
<PB N="13" REF="011483_0013_0F832E5814933A28" MS="y">
but who can conceive any proper idea of a &s;pirit by the word, what he is, and how he appears to the mind? He is only known to the mind by his own influences, through a holy medium of his own adapting; by the &s;en&s;ible operation and effects of his wi&s;dom and power there. And as every object exhibits its own proper idea to the eye, and de|clares it&s;elf thereby in the light, as a proper and nece&s;&s;ary medium of &s;eeing, without which we could not have formed any idea of things at all; &s;o likewi&s;e we can form no idea of God, but what he him&s;elf is plea&s;ed to give, and in what manner, and by what medium &s;oever he makes him&s;elf known; and is to all mankind whatever he plea&s;es to appear to be, and that is according to the various &s;tates of men. And to the faithful, holy, &s;incere, and obedient, he is love; but to the unfaithful, unclean, hypocrites, and di&s;obedient, he is a con|&s;uming fire and de&s;troyer; and we are one to another whatever he thinks proper to make us.</P>
<P>AND I give you a &s;imile in the works of God; that as we can form no idea of the body of the &s;un in the firmament of heaven but what him&s;elf exhi|bits, nor can we &s;ee him but by the efflux of his own light, as from its proper center, which darting up|on the eye when in its rectitude, directs it to the object: And as we have no words, or means, by which we can convey a proper idea of light to the under&s;tanding of one that is born blind, or the manner of its di&s;covering objects to the &s;ight; even &s;o, there are no words in any language I am ac|quainted with, whereby we can convey the idea we conceive of God, by his own act of manife&s;ting, to any other, but to &s;uch only as have the like ideas from the &s;ame manner of appearance in them&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="011483_0014_0F832E59FB58DB18">WE expre&s;s abundance of words concerning God, and the things of God, very little under|&s;tood by the greate&s;t part of mankind to whom we &s;peak: Therefore we direct all to the Lord him&s;elf, that he may teach them true knowledge and wi&s;|dom; the knowledge of him&s;elf, in a &s;tate of re|tirement, and in the &s;ilence of all the imaginations, cogitations, agitations, de&s;ires, affections, pa&s;&s;ions and hurries of the natural mind, which is ever in action and fluctuating, pa&s;&s;ing from object to object, till the Almighty, by the manife&s;tation of his eter|nal word, and the influences of his holy &s;pirit and grace, commands &s;ilence in the mind, in&s;pires her with under&s;tanding, and works a change there.</P>
<P>GOD &s;peaks to the under&s;tanding by the opera|tion of the word of his divine power, by revealing the things of God through the in&s;hining of the eternal light thereof in the mind: And when the mo&s;t high &s;o qualifies the mind, by his work of &s;anctification therein, that he him&s;elf becomes the only object, and the mind is &s;ettled and &s;tayed upon him alone; then all the creatures of God, and all the enjoyment of them, is lo&s;t, for the time, and of no regard in compari&s;on of the great and glorious creator of all, and the divine and unutterable peace, joy, and con&s;olation, found in him, even in this pre&s;ent world, &s;o far as our pre|&s;ent mode of being can bear the earne&s;t and &s;ure evidence of the fulne&s;s, when time to us here &s;hall be no more.</P>
<P>I NOW proceed with what is further before me, as I may have a&s;&s;i&s;tance, by the grace of God, and utterance, for we &s;peak, from time to time, tho&s;e things that are renewed or opened in our minds and under&s;tandings, without any particular application to any one; the Lord him&s;elf, knowing every

<P>I SAY then that mankind are degenerated, being mi&s;led by their own &s;en&s;es and &s;en&s;ual appetites, into the love of the creatures (things without them) and them&s;elves, and &s;o become &s;trangers, and alienated from the life of God, through their own darkne&s;s and corruptions; and peradventure the greate&s;t of all that are here have been &s;o, as well as my&s;elf: Yet &s;till we find &s;omething in our&s;elves, admoni&s;h|ing us of our mi&s;takes, in our cour&s;e through this world; and we ought to reflect, and con&s;ider what this is, which many times &s;urprizes us with the re|membrance of things pa&s;t, which we had forgot for &s;ome years.</P>
<P>THIS is one who has wrote down all our failings, as it were, in his book; and he opens the leaves thereof, and &s;hews us all the errors of our lives, and brings every thing to remembrance in our minds and under&s;tandings, one thing after another; and then, and not till then, we have a right foun|dation for repentance and &s;orrow for &s;in (for he who never &s;ees his &s;ins, can never repent) and then, as the apo&s;tle &s;aith, "&s;in becomes exceeding &s;inful;" they are ever before us, &s;o that the mind becomes thereby heavy laden and oppre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>AND then, and not till then, we mortals are wil|ling to cry for a &s;aviour, O Lord, a &s;aviour, or I am undone for ever! How then comes the knowledge of &s;in? It is through the love of God, who is not willing that any &s;hould live, and die, and peri&s;h therein. It is made manife&s;t by the brightne&s;s of that all-di&s;cover|ing holy medium, which the mo&s;t high father of all hath mercifully provided for that great and ble&s;&s;ed end; that mankind might be redeemed, made free

<P>WE all mu&s;t own, that the wi&s;dom of God is him&s;elf, the power of God is him&s;elf, the &s;pirit of God is him&s;elf: He is that eternal &s;pirit, and was never without his wi&s;dom and power from ever|la&s;ting. He, therefore, hath been plea&s;ed to a&s;|&s;ume, and unite unto him&s;elf, the whole human nature; not only the intelligent rea&s;onable mind, but al&s;o the mortal part of man, which is the body, by which he might come near unto mankind, in our own nature and likene&s;s, under the character and name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who in the holy &s;crip|ture is called the wi&s;dom of God; and the power of God; and by <HI>John,</HI> the evangeli&s;t, is called the word of God, by whom the world was made, and all things that therein are. And I conclude none are &s;o weak as to think the body of Chri&s;t is the wi&s;|dom and power of God, but a miraculous effect of that cau&s;e, and, as the apo&s;tle compares it, is as a veil, whereby he veiled his divine nature, for a time, from every eye.</P>
<P>AND the human mind, or rea&s;onable &s;oul of Chri&s;t, is likewi&s;e a veil, but of a more excellent kind than the body, though congenial with the intellectual mind of mankind;
<Q>for he was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without &s;in,</Q>
(according to the language of holy writ.)</P>
<P>GOD dwelleth in inacce&s;&s;ible divine light, which no eye can penetrate, which no &s;oul can with open face behold; therefore the Lord hath conde&s;cended to veil his glory, by a&s;&s;uming a human mind, e&s;&s;entially united to him&s;elf, thereby accommodat|ing him &s;o to the mind of man, as to appear and be manife&s;ted therein; and he who thus appears <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 word"> the true God, as it is written,

<P>In the minds of mankind he di&s;covers to our under&s;tandings whatever is proper for us to know of him&s;elf, or our duty toward him, and one to|ward another. The Lord begins with &s;mall things, wherein if we are faithful and obedient, he makes more and more of him&s;elf, and the enjoyment of his divine pre&s;ence and goodne&s;s, and his ju&s;t and holy ways, known unto us; but if we err and di&s;|obey, though but in &s;mall things, the mind is op|pre&s;&s;ed thereby till we return and amend.</P>
<P>THIS is the beginning of the manife&s;tation of the law of the &s;pirit of life, which makes free from the law of &s;in and death, the revelation of the mind of Chri&s;t. He manife&s;ts in the minds of mankind &s;uch things as are proper, according to our &s;everal degrees and capacities, beginning with little low things, as a &s;chool-ma&s;ter, till we are capable of more, and then gradually he opens in us the my&s;teries of his kingdom. He that hates in&s;truction, hates the in&s;tructor, according to what he &s;aith under the character of wi&s;dom,
<Q>how long, ye &s;imple ones, will ye love &s;implicity, and ye fools hate knowledge? Turn ye at my re|proof, and I will pour forth of my &s;pirit upon you.</Q></P>
<P>THEREFORE hear the reproof of in&s;truction in your minds and under&s;tandings, that the &s;pirit of wi&s;dom may be poured forth upon you; that you may fir&s;t become proficients, and perfect in all moral righteou&s;ne&s;s and duties, by the dictates of this wi&s;dom, which if we de&s;pi&s;e and refu&s;e, we never can attain; and then, as the Lord Je&s;us hath &s;aid,

you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will make you rulers over greater riches?</Q></P>
<P>IF men are not righteous and ju&s;t one toward another in temporal things, how can they expect the divine influences of the immortal &s;pirit and power of God, the true and eternal riches? If we are not faithful to the di&s;coveries and dictates of the law of the &s;pirit of life, the light of the divine word, manife&s;ted in our minds, how can we ex|pect to experience the effu&s;ion of divine love in our hearts, which is the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing, and highe&s;t attainment, human kind are capable of in this life? This is that eternal life, this is the grace of God which is come by Chri&s;t, and is of an everliving nature; but if man refu&s;es this, and goes on from one evil to another, he rejects that eternal life, and by degrees degenerates more and more, till he be|comes altogether &s;en&s;ual as a brute bea&s;t, as it is written,
<Q>the &s;pirit of a bea&s;t goes downward, but the &s;pirit of a man goes upward.</Q>
For the man that a&s;cends by degrees of virtue and holine&s;s, one degree after another, till he comes to be united unto God, through Chri&s;t, the ble&s;&s;ed medium, in whom is the fulne&s;s of all divine virtue, that &s;oul hath the enjoyment of the divine pre&s;ence in this world, in a manner not to be expre&s;&s;ed by the language of men or angels.</P>
<P>IN this great city there are many temptations, and opportunities to hurtful things; and I have &s;ometimes con&s;idered the youth among us to be in great danger of corruption thereby: But the holy &s;pirit of God &s;trives with you, and would gather every &s;oul to him&s;elf.

<P>SOME are &s;o bent toward the mean, low, and &s;ordid plea&s;ures of an animal and &s;en&s;ual life, that they could even wi&s;h, for the &s;ake thereof, that they had no future &s;tate; and &s;ome are ready to wi&s;h, O! that I were but as the little bird upon the tree, that I might go where I plea&s;e, and do what I will, without any account of my actions in this world, or in another, if there be any yet to come! There is nothing more dreadful, and to which a rea&s;onable thinking mind is more aver&s;e, than to remain without the knowledge of God, and not to believe a future &s;tate. I have often thought any tolerable being is better than none at all; I would therefore have your minds &s;o ennobled, as to contemplate the divine Being, con&s;ider the great Creator, and how much better it is to become acquainted with him, become like him, and to live forever with him, and in his favour, than to be an|nihilated.

<P>AS concerning moral precepts, and all the com|mandments of God, they are given altogether for our good, and it is our highe&s;t intere&s;t to ob&s;erve them.

<P><PB N="28" REF="011483_0028_0F832E64350BA6A0">WE &s;ee a great many things here in this world which we de&s;ire, and do not obtain; and if we had them, they would be really hurtful to us, though not &s;o in their own nature, but &s;o unto us, by rea|&s;on of our mi&s;application and abu&s;e of them, or our&s;elves, or one another, in them; and therefore God, in goodne&s;s and mercy, is come near unto the minds of mankind, or rather has brought us near unto him&s;elf, through that holy and ble&s;&s;ed medium whom he hath prepared, and by whom he convinceth the heart of man, and directs him to the choice of the be&s;t things; that is, the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, by his inward and &s;piritual appearance; of whom I may &s;peak a little as he may be plea&s;ed to make way in my under&s;tanding, and give me &s;trength and utterance; and I would not have <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to be to any of you in vain.</P>
<P>WE mortals do naturally de&s;ire after knowledge; and it is good, well applied to the u&s;eful things of this life; and we have heard many excellent &s;ay|ings, on divers &s;ubjects and occa&s;ions, during our time in this world, concerning matters of the high|e&s;t importance, and have likewi&s;e read of them; yet many of them we may not have under&s;tood, and forgot mo&s;t of them, through negligence or di&s;re|li&s;h.</P>
<P>BESIDES, if through much labour, co&s;t and dili|gence, we have attained to great knowledge in ma|ny things; and think our&s;elves wi&s;e and learned, and therefore &s;et a high and over-value upon our|&s;elves, and are thereby exalted and puffed up, and are al&s;o e&s;teemed of others, as men of letters, un|der&s;tanding and knowledge; what would all this avail?

&s;eated in a natural or carnal mind; and then all that knowledge will end as a fla&s;h, vani&s;h, and be of u&s;e to us no more.</P>
<P>LET us therefore hearken to the divine voice of the Mo&s;t High, our Creator him&s;elf, by whom we are graciou&s;ly invited to the mo&s;t excellent, nece&s;|&s;ary, and permanent knowledge, wherein we can|not offend him; that knowledge which is accom|panied with life eternal, and will remain &s;ettled in the pure mind to all eternity, and is to be learned and had of God only, who hath &s;aid,

It is by this knowledge the Mo&s;t High will exalt him&s;elf, or manife&s;t his eternal power, excellency and exaltation, as the creator and upholder of all things, in all nations, and in all people throughout the earth, in his own time.</P>
<P>BUT what kind of <HI>&s;tillne&s;s</HI> do you think this is?

<Q>No man knoweth the Son but the Fa|ther, neither knoweth any man the Father, &s;ave the Son, and he to whom&s;oever the Son will re|veal him.</Q>
Let us therefore examine our&s;elves, and con&s;ider the&s;e &s;ayings, every one for one; what do I <HI>know</HI> of the&s;e things?

<P>WE &s;ee what the Lord Chri&s;t &s;aith of him&s;elf; he calls him&s;elf the TRUTH; "I am the way" (&s;aith he)
<Q>and the truth, and the life: No man com|eth unto the Father but by me. If ye had known me, ye &s;hould have known my Father al&s;o: And from henceforth ye know him, and have &s;een him.</Q>
He is the way to God the Father, the truth, and divine and eternal life.</P>
<P>DIVERS of the prophets of God, e&s;pecially <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> and <HI>Daniel,</HI> by the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t which was in them, prophe&s;ied of the coming of Chri&s;t to the Jews, many hundreds of years before he came, &s;o clearly and plain, as if they had rather been writing hi&s;tories of things pa&s;t, than prophe&s;ying of things to come: And he came accordingly in the fle&s;h, born of the <HI>Virgin Mary,</HI> and appeared among them for a time, and in him were fulfilled all the prophecies concerning the MESSIAH. And having

fini&s;hed all other the great ends of his coming, in the conclu&s;ion of all, he yielded up his precious &s;oul upon the cro&s;s, a propitiatory and acceptable &s;acrifice, declaratory of the love and mercy of the Father to the whole world.</P>
<P>BUT a little before his departure he foretold his di&s;ciples of another admini&s;tration, and more di|vine manner of appearance of him&s;elf than that was, to tho&s;e who believed in him, and followed him. You may read at your lei&s;ure, in the 14th, 15th and 16th chapters of <HI>John</HI> the evangeli&s;t, many di|vine and &s;piritual &s;ayings of the Son of God, for your information concerning the Father and him|&s;elf.
<Q>It is expedient for you (&s;aid he) that I go away; for if I go not away, the comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will &s;end him unto you: And when he is come, he will reprove (or convince) the world of &s;in, of righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, and of judgment: Of &s;in, becau&s;e they believe not in me,</Q>
&amp;c. chap. xvi. 7, 8, 9. Again,
<Q>I will pray the Father, and he &s;hall give you another comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; even the Spirit of TRUTH, whom the world cannot receive, becau&s;e it &s;eeth him not, neither knoweth him; but ye know him, for he dwelleth with you, and &s;hall be <HI>in you.</HI> I will not leave you comfortle&s;s, I will come to you.

with you: But the comforter, which is the Holy Gho&s;t, whom the Father will &s;end in my name, he &s;hall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, what&s;oever I have &s;aid unto you.</Q>
<HI>John</HI> xiv. ver. 16, 17, to 26, inclu&s;ive.</P>
<P>HERE Chri&s;t was with his di&s;ciples as man, and they &s;aw him face to face, as we &s;ee one another, and he talked with them familiarly and graciou&s;ly on tho&s;e divive and mo&s;t important &s;ubjects.
<Q>It is expedient for you that I go away:</Q>
Why was his departure, as to his bodily pre&s;ence, &s;o expedi|ent for them? That departing, as to his bodily pre&s;ence, which was to be but for a &s;hort time, he might thereby make way for a more excellent di&s;|pen&s;ation and appearance of him&s;elf, inwardly in &s;pirit, as he is life eternal, and the true comfort|er. Can any one doubt therefore who this divine comforter is? Sure it is no other then Chri&s;t him|&s;elf in &s;pirit; for the &s;ame who is the TRUTH, is the &s;pirit of-truth. The Holy Gho&s;t, the comfort|er, is Chri&s;t him&s;elf in &s;pirit; for though he &s;peaks of one in the third per&s;on, as of another than him|&s;elf, yet it evidently appears, by comparing one of tho&s;e texts with another (if we had no other evi|dence) that it was no other than his own &s;pirit that was to be manife&s;ted in them after his glorification. And what and who it is in mankind that reproves and convinces us of &s;in, is plainly the Holy Gho&s;t, according to &s;cripture evidence; and yet we have a more &s;ure te&s;timony, even the Truth Him&s;elf, by the manife&s;tation of his power and grace in our hearts, opening unto us the holy &s;criptures, and bearing witne&s;s that he, the &s;pirit him&s;elf, was the author of them.</P>
<P>'Tis the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t then that reproves the world, even the whole world, of &s;in; and the fir&s;t great
<PB N="33" REF="011483_0033_0F832E67D9131CF8">
&s;in is unbelief, as the inlet and foundation of all others:
<Q>Of &s;in (&s;aith the Lord Je&s;us) "becau&s;e they believe not in me.</Q>
<HI>Adam</HI> did not &s;in till he departed from his faith in the word of God; and as we are his offspring, and ignorant of God by nature, we do not believe in him, and therefore we &s;in again&s;t him: Neverthele&s;s that we may be redeemed from &s;in and eternal death, and return unto God and live, he hath, in un&s;peakable love and mercy, &s;ent the &s;pirit of his Son Chri&s;t, the word of life, into our hearts, to reprove and convince us of our &s;in, make us &s;en&s;ible of it, and repent, be|lieve in him, and be &s;aved from &s;in and all un|righteou&s;ne&s;s and uncleanne&s;s, and from all its deadly fruits, and have daily communion with God in this life, and be glorified with God and the Lamb in a &s;tate of everla&s;ting bli&s;s, when time to us here &s;hall be no more.</P>
<P>BY this divine, &s;piritual, and inward coming of Chri&s;t, he &s;peaks, or manife&s;ts to the under&s;tanding, all things nece&s;&s;ary to eternal life. He mortifies and &s;ubdues all the evil thoughts and de&s;ires in the hearts of them who believe and receive him in the way of his coming, in love. He de&s;troys and takes away the root of evil in mankind; as it is written,
<Q>for this end was the Son of God made manife&s;t, that he might de&s;troy the works of the devil.</Q>
How then doth Chri&s;t begin this work? Ju&s;t as he &s;aid before; for the fir&s;t work is, the condemnation of man for the &s;in of unbelief in him, with all the re&s;t of his &s;ins grounded thereon, or con&s;equential thereto; and not only of all man's own righteou&s;ne&s;s, of his own inventing, but con|vinces him al&s;o of the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God, who ju&s;tly condemns and reproves him for &s;in; the mind a&s;&s;enting al&s;o to the ju&s;tice of God, manife&s;ted and
<PB N="34" REF="011483_0034_0F832E6893669168">
executed on the author of &s;in, the prince of all the ungodly of this world, and of darkne&s;s: And this is effected by the &s;pirit and power of Chri&s;t, as he is divine, eternal, univer&s;al light, and judge of the world. And the fir&s;t act of the mind of man (thus convinced) toward Chri&s;t is, to believe in him as light and its immediate object; then to for&s;ake &s;in, &s;elf, and Satan, through the grace of God, and become obedient to every di&s;covery of truth in the under&s;tanding thus illuminated, that &s;o we may be born of that light, and thereby become the children of God (who is eternal light) and heirs of eternal life: As &s;aid the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t,
<Q>believe in the light, that ye may become children of light.</Q>
And again, in him is life, and that life is the light of men; and though this light &s;hineth in the dark hearts of men, yet they do not comprehend it; though this is the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world, yet they do not know him, and therefore they do not receive him; but to as many as do receive him, as he is the word of God and divine, eternal light, he gives power to become the &s;ons and daughters of God, to them who believe in his name: Tho&s;e are born, not of blood, nor of the will of the fle&s;h, nor of the will of man, but of God. This indi&s;pen&s;ible work of regeneration comes not by de&s;cent of blood, nor by generation of the mo&s;t holy progenitors, nor by any thing man can do in his own will or power, or by any inventions or &s;y&s;tems of religion contrived and impo&s;ed by man; but is the work of God alone, by his holy &s;pirit, in them who believe in his, wi&s;dom and power, in the inward manife&s;tations of it in their own hearts. <HI>John</HI> i. 4, 5, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.</P>
<P>CHRIST him&s;elf then, in his &s;econd coming, was the comforter of all tho&s;e who had believed in him,
<PB N="35" REF="011483_0035_0F832E6955528EA0">
and received him in his fir&s;t coming, and &s;o he is &s;till: And the nature of this comfort is &s;uch, that it un&s;peakably tran&s;cends all the &s;atisfaction and enjoyments we can have in the creatures of God, human or others, or any plea&s;ures of our own in|venting. No other enjoyment is to be laid in the ballance with that divine love and con&s;olation, which the holy &s;pirit of Chri&s;t gives in the mind; He is all con&s;olation, and peace, and divine love.</P>
<P>THUS he was to be a comforter to his di&s;ciples and followers (and more al&s;o) and &s;o he is &s;till. He was to be their leader and guide into <HI>all truth,</HI> and their great <HI>remembrancer</HI> and in&s;tructor: He had many things then to &s;ay unto them, but they could not bear them at that time. <HI>John</HI> xiv. 26. xv. 26, and xvi. 12. And who&s;oever are acquainted with this coming of the Son of God, are much weaned from de&s;ires after the many things of this world and their plea&s;ures therein are mightily abated and cut off: Only tho&s;e things that are need|ful for the &s;upport of life and &s;u&s;tentation of the body, obtained by de&s;cent from relations, or lawful and hone&s;t indu&s;try, rightly u&s;ed and applied, are ble&s;&s;ings in this life from God, in the cour&s;e of his good providence, and for which we are to be thankful unto him, in the enjoyment of them.</P>
<P>AND though Chri&s;t is all this, and whatever can be de&s;ired, unto his people and children, from time to time, according to the will of God the Father, yet no man can command this con&s;olation, or any manife&s;tation of him, in his own will or time: It is the gift of God, and therefore we wait for it from him, in a holy and humble re|&s;ignation to his will; and he is not wanting to us therein, in his own time, as we remain faithful in our love and duty to him. Of this I am fully &s;atis|fied,
<PB N="36" REF="011483_0036_0F832E6A142BE508">
and do under&s;tand and know, that there is a divine &s;elf-evidencing immortal <HI>power</HI> manife&s;ting it&s;elf, from time to time, in the minds of mankind, and &s;en&s;ibly influencing them, after a mo&s;t agreea|ble manner, the idea whereof is incommunicable by any language but its own, unto any who have not the experience of the &s;ame thing in them&s;elves; and that this power is not e&s;&s;ential to the being of man; he was and is man before he knew or knows it; the cele&s;tial influences whereof cannot be commanded, or had, by man when he plea&s;es; though he may re&s;i&s;t, oppo&s;e, and neglect them, to his own everla&s;ting ruin: And I believe I am &s;peaking in the audience of many of both &s;exes, that have evidence, and are witne&s;&s;es, that there is a di|vine, living, &s;oul-quickening power appearing in them, which is not of them&s;elves, which they can|not move or command in their own time.</P>
<P>NOW &s;eeing Chri&s;t the Lord is thus the regene|rator, leader, &s;trengthener, and &s;upporter of them who believe in, follow and obey him, what is he to the world? And who is this world? Even all man|kind, throughout all ages, pa&s;t, and at this time, and ever will be, who have not believed, do not, or &s;hall not believe in the <HI>word</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> they are all compre|hended under this general word, the <HI>world.</HI> He &s;hall reprove the world of &s;in: Here is a general reproof of all the world for &s;in. What then is &s;in? It is the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of a law; for where there is no law, there is no tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. What law therefore hath the world received from God and tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed, for which they are reproved and condemned by the Holy Gho&s;t? Doth he mention any manner of immoral actions, prohibited by any given law, for which he &s;hall reprove them? No, it is becau&s;e they believe not in him who does reprove them: For, though
<PB N="37" REF="011483_0037_0F832E6BE7BA74B8">
God hath written and made manife&s;t this law, the law of the &s;pirit of life, the law of divine light, in all mankind in the world, from the foundation there|of; yet the world hath &s;till hated and oppo&s;ed it, both in them&s;elves, and in tho&s;e who have believed and obeyed it.</P>
<P>GOD condemned the old world for their &s;ins, and de&s;troyed them in judgment without mercy: Is God unrighteous therefore, or cruel? Did he con|demn the world without offence, or the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of any known law, and the highe&s;t provocation? No, God is altogether holy, righteous, ju&s;t and good, and &s;o is his law, and all his ways are truth, and condemneth none without a cau&s;e on man's part, and ju&s;tly. We find, therefore, that God gave a law to the old world altogether good, and well adapted from the beginning of it; for the neglect, contempt, and breach whereof they were ju&s;tly condemned; for, &s;aith the Lord, my <HI>&s;pirit</HI> &s;hall not always <HI>&s;trive with man.</HI> Again, in him (that is, in Chri&s;t, the word of God) was life, and that life was the light of men; this was their law, which law they brake; and for which they were condemned and puni&s;hed. This is the my&s;tery that lay hid from the foundation of the world, Chri&s;t in man|kind the only hope of glory; and this law is in being &s;till, and ever will be, and is written in the hearts of all mankind; this law is light, and is as a lamp always burning; the true light which lighteth every man, male and female, that cometh into the world; which is again re&s;tored by the union of the &s;ame with the nature of man, in the man Chri&s;t Je&s;us; that who&s;oever believeth in him, and obey+eth him, &s;hall have forgivene&s;s of &s;ins, and life everla&s;ting; even by him by whom came the law of the &s;pirit of life, which &s;ets free from the law of
<PB N="38" REF="011483_0038_0F832E6C53B08AE8">
&s;in and death; being life everla&s;ting in its own na|ture. This law being given unto all nations under heaven, men generally break it in one article or other; by obeying and following the lu&s;ts of the fle&s;h, the lu&s;ts of the eye, and pride of life, and their own inventions and imaginations; for which this law reproves and condemns them, and from which condemnation they can never be &s;aved, till they believe therein and obey; it being the &s;piritual appearance of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the word of God, the true light, which lighteth every man, male and female, that cometh into the world.</P>
<P>MEN may &s;tout it out as much and long as they plea&s;e, and decry the Holy Spirit of God, and call it by what opprobrious names they will; yet this eternal light and day of God will be the everla&s;ting condemnation of all tho&s;e who continue in unbelief. And until mankind come to believe in the Son of God, they mu&s;t remain in a &s;tate of &s;eparation from God, in ignorance and condemnation.</P>

For <HI>John</HI> truly <HI>baptized</HI> with <HI>water,</HI> but ye &s;hall be <HI>baptized</HI> with the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI> not many days hence; but ye &s;hall receive <HI>power</HI> after that the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI> is come <HI>upon you.</HI> And ye &s;hall be <HI>witne&s;&s;es</HI> unto me, both in <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and in all <HI>Judea,</HI> and in <HI>Samaria,</HI> and unto the uttermo&s;t part of the earth. <HI>Acts</HI> i. 4, 5, 8.</P>
<P>BY all which it appears, that the apo&s;tles of Chri&s;t were commanded and authorized by Chri&s;t to proclaim him unto all nations, and to bear wit|ne&s;s

of him, not only what he had done in the fle&s;h in that admini&s;tration, but as he is the word of God, the light of the world, and Holy Gho&s;t; and that all who &s;hould believe in him as he is that light &s;hould be baptized with the Holy Gho&s;t (that is, be made partakers of it in &s;ome degree) and be &s;aved; but that they who did not believe &s;hould remain where they were, under everla&s;ting con|demnation by the Holy Gho&s;t as a perpetual, true, and powerful witne&s;s again&s;t them. This con|demnation is as we &s;tand in the &s;tate of nature in the fir&s;t <HI>Adam,</HI> and in unbelief from which, never|thele&s;s, we may be redeemed and &s;aved, if we do not <HI>continue</HI> in <HI>unbelief</HI> and <HI>di&s;obedience:</HI> But if we do not believe in the Son of God, as he is the divine light, and &s;ent as &s;uch unto us, that <HI>condemnation</HI> will be <HI>confirmed</HI> upon us, and remain for ever.</P>
<P>BUT then &s;ome may think it hard that &s;o many millions of people, who never heard of Chri&s;t, &s;hould be damned becau&s;e they do not believe. To whom I &s;ay, that, &s;o far as God doth make manife&s;t his will by the light of his Son Chri&s;t, that is his law to <HI>that</HI> &s;oul; and &s;o far as man loveth that law, and &s;hows it by practice, he cannot truly be called an unbeliever, he believes in a holy SOMETHING, a <HI>powerful per&s;ua&s;ive</HI> SOMETHING, for which he has no name; and when he acts and &s;ays according to the manife&s;tations of it, he finds peace, tranquility, and con&s;olation in his mind; but when he &s;peaks or acts contrary to it, he finds trouble; &s;o that he is di&s;ciplined, as by the rod and rea&s;onable per&s;ua&s;ion, into moral virtue and goodne&s;s. I therefore conclude this is a mode and degree of faith in the Son of God, the light of the world, working by love: And God is not unrigh|teous or unrea&s;onable, to require any more of any

one than he hath given or made known; for Chri&s;t &s;aid to the <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> and the re&s;t of the unbelieving <HI>Jews,</HI> if ye had been <HI>blind</HI> you had <HI>not had &s;in,</HI> but whereas you &s;ay you &s;ee, you have no cloak for your &s;in.</P>
<P>MANY of tho&s;e who make no profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t, and to whom he hath not been in&s;trumentally preached, are in the practice of moral virtue, do|ing as they would be done by, through the evidence they have of it as a duty, by the <HI>divine light</HI> giving them <HI>under&s;tanding,</HI> though they do not know, or <HI>formally</HI> believe in it, <HI>under that character, in any language.</HI> Whatever you &s;ee therefore (for I have a mixed auditory) or &s;u&s;pect in your minds to be wrong, &s;hun it with all your &s;trength; yet not tru&s;ting therein, but in the grace of God; and the Lord, in his own good time, will open his coun&s;el, and give you divine wi&s;dom and under|&s;tanding, according to his kind invitation:
<Q>Lift up thy voice for wi&s;dom, and with all thy get|tings get under&s;tanding:</Q>
For the knowledge of God is everla&s;ting life:
<Q>This is life eternal, (&s;aith the Son of God) to <HI>know</HI> thee the only true God, and Je&s;us Chri&s;t, whom thou ha&s;t &s;ent.</Q>
Then follow on and proceed in the knowledge of God, and in the increa&s;e of that wi&s;dom, where|by to avoid every appearance of evil.</P>
<P>Now I would ob&s;erve to you, that the Chri&s;tian religion, in every form of it, or whatever is &s;o cal|led, is accidental to the greate&s;t part of mankind profe&s;&s;ing it, being educated in &s;ome kind of no|tion or profe&s;&s;ion or other, according to the &s;enti|ments of their parents, guardians, or tutors, be|fore they have any thought or under&s;tanding to di&s;tingui&s;h between truth and error, and mo&s;t com+monly fall into that way or profe&s;&s;ion of religion

mo&s;t in <HI>repute</HI> in the <HI>world,</HI> and mo&s;t <HI>fa&s;hionable;</HI> if therefore one is born among the <HI>Roman Catholics,</HI> he is of that way; if among the <HI>Epi&s;copalians,</HI> he is of that way; or, among the <HI>Pre&s;byterians, Indepen|dents, Bapti&s;ts,</HI> or us who are now di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name, of <HI>Quakers,</HI> they are of tho&s;e &s;everal ways or profe&s;&s;ions; and if among the <HI>Mahometans,</HI> they are of that fal&s;e way. How powerful therefore and di|rective is the prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and prejudice of educa|tion; and how uncertain and un&s;table is any foun|dation laid only in that way? Howbeit, where there is nothing el&s;e but motions, true ones are better than fal&s;e; and where there is only a mixture, the true&s;t are be&s;t of all, and may be taught and embraced, till he who is the TRUTH appears, and till light and life be made manife&s;t in him.</P>
<P>THE religion then which mo&s;t of you under this di&s;tinction at this day do profe&s;s, you had it fir&s;t accidentally by education, tradition, and imitation; but being convinced by the holy &s;pirit of truth, and believing in and obeying the &s;ame, to the &s;anctifying of your minds, by the effectual operation of the power and divine virtue thereof in you, your religion is now become that of your under&s;tandings, judgment, experience, and know|ledge; wherein being e&s;tabli&s;hed as upon the &s;ure rock of ages, and foundation of all the generations of the righteous from the beginning of the world, even upon Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the wi&s;dom and power of God, you are not perverted, nor I hope perverti|ble; nor to&s;&s;ed in uncertainties by the &s;ubtle inven|tions of crafty yet ignorant and de&s;igning men, wherein they are deceived and deceiving: As it is written, if the blind lead the blind, they &s;hall both fall into the ditch.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="011483_0043_0F832E70DFFB3D98">To conclude: There never was any thing in the world under the notion of religion worthy of that name, &s;ave what came by the in&s;piration of God, whereby the knowledge of him&s;elf was taught by the revelation of the Son of God, that mankind might be re&s;tored to communion with God in this pre&s;ent world, and to know him to be the mo&s;t beneficent and &s;ure comforter, and that at la&s;t we may come to launch into the fulne&s;s of his goodne&s;s, at who&s;e right hand are rivers of divine plea&s;ure, for evermore.</P>
