<HEAD>A brief Narrative of the Ca&s;e and Try|al of <HI>John Peter Zenger,</HI> Printer of the <HI>New-York weekly Journal.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AS There was but one Printer in the Province of <HI>New-York,</HI> that printed a publick News Paper, I was in Hopes, if I undertook to pub|li&s;h another, I might make it worth my while; and I &s;oon found my Hopes were not groundle&s;s: My fir&s;t Paper was printed, <HI>Nov.</HI> 5<HI>th,</HI> 1733. and I continued printing and publi&s;hing of them, I thought to the Satisfaction of every Body, till the <HI>January</HI> following; when the Chief Ju&s;tice was plea&s;ed to animadvert upon the Doctrine of Libels, in a long Charge given in that Term to the Grand Jury, and afterwards on the third <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> of <HI>October,</HI> 1734. was again plea&s;ed to charge the Grand Jury in the following Words.</P>
<Q><P><HI>Gentlemen</HI>; I &s;hall conclude with reading a Paragraph or two out of the &s;ame Book, concerning Libels; they are arrived to that Height, that they call loudly for your Animadver&s;ion; it is high Time to put a Stop to them; for at the rate Things are now carried on, when all Order and Government is endeavoured to be trampled on; Reflections are ca&s;t upon Per&s;ons of all Degrees, mu&s;t not the&s;e Things end in Sedition, if not timely prevented? Lenity, you have &s;een will not avail, it becomes you then to enquire after the Of|fenders, that we may in a due Cour&s;e of Law be enabled to puni&s;h them. If you, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> do not interpo&s;e, con&s;ider whether the ill Con&s;equences that may ari&s;e from any Di&s;turbances of the publick Peace, may not in part, lye at your Door?</P>
<P>Hawkins, <HI>in his Chapter of Libels, con&s;iders three Points, 1</HI>st. What &s;hall be &s;aid to be a Libel. <HI>2</HI>dly. Who are lyable to be puni&s;hed for it. <HI>3</HI>dly. In what Manner they are to be puni&s;hed. <HI>Under the 1</HI>st. <HI>he &s;ays, &sect;. 7.</HI> Nor can there be any Doubt, but that a Writing which defames a private Per&s;on only, is as much a Libel as that which defames Per&s;ons intru&s;ted in a publick Capacity, in as much as it manife&s;tly tends to create ill Blood, and to cau&s;e a Di&s;turbance of the publick Pea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">; however, it is certain, that it is a very high Aggravation of a Libel, that it tends to &s;candalize the Government, by reflecting on tho&s;e who are entru&s;ted with the Admini|&s;tration of publick Affairs, which does not only endanger the publick Peace, as all other Libels do, by &s;tirring up the Parties immediately concerned in it&punc; to Acts of Revenge, but al&s;o has a direct Tendency to breed in the People a Di&s;like of their Governours, and incline them to Faction and Sedition. <HI>As to the 2</HI>d. <HI>Point he &s;ays &sect;. 10.</HI> It is certain, not only he who compo&s;es or procures another to compo&s;e it&punc; but al&s;o that he who publi&s;hes&punc; or procures another to publi&s;h it are in Danger of being puni&s;hed for it; and it is &s;aid not to be material whether he who d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s;es a Libel, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 line">

ea&s;y than to publi&s;h the mo&s;t virulent Papers with the greate&s;t Security if the conceal|ing the Purport of them from an illiterate Publi&s;her, would make him &s;afe in the di&s;|per&s;ing them: Al&s;o, it has been &s;aid, that if he who hath either read a Libel him&s;elf, or hath heard it read by another, do afterwards maliciou&s;ly read or report any Part of it in the Pre&s;ence of others, or lend or &s;hew it to another, he is guilty of an unlawful Publication of it. Al&s;o, it hath been holden, that the Copying of a Libel &s;hall be a conclu&s;ive Evidence of the Publication of it, unle&s;s the Party can prove, that he delivered it to a Magi&s;trate to examine it, in which Ca&s;e the Act <HI>&s;ub&s;equent</HI> is &s;aid to explain the Intention <HI>precedent.</HI> But it &s;eems to be the better Opinion, that he who fir&s;t writes a Libel, dictated by another, is thereby guilty of Making of it, and con&s;equently puni&s;hable for the bare Writing; for it was no Libel till it was reduced to Writing.</P>
<P>The&s;e, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> are &s;ome of the Offences which are to make Part of your Enquiries; and if any other &s;hould ari&s;e in the Cour&s;e of your Proceedings, in which you are at a Lo&s;s, or conceive any Doubts, upon your Application here, We will a&s;&s;i&s;t and direct you.</P></Q>
<P>The Grand Jury not endicting me as was expected, the Gentlemen of the Council proceeded to take my Journals into Con&s;ideration, and &s;ent the fol|lowing Me&s;&s;age to the general A&s;&s;embly.</P>

<P>Upon reading of which ORDER, the Court forbad the Entring thereof in their Books at that Time, and many of them declared, that if it &s;hould be entred, they would have their Prote&s;t entered again&s;t it.</P>
<P>On <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> the 6<HI>th</HI> of <HI>November,</HI> the Sherriff of <HI>New-York</HI> moved the Court of <HI>Quarter Se&s;&s;ions,</HI> to comply with the &s;aid Order, upon which one of the Aldermen offered a prote&s;t, which was read by the Clerk, and approved of by all the Aldermen, either expre&s;sly or by not objecting to it, and is as fol|loweth.</P>
<Q><P>Whereas an ORDER has been &s;erved on this Court, in the&s;e Words.</P>
<P>[<HI>The Order as above incerted.</HI>]</P>
<P>And whereas this Court conceives, they are only to be commanded by the King's Mandatory Writs, authorized by Law, to which they conceive they have the Right of &s;hewing Cau&s;e why they don't obey them, if they believe them improper to be obey'd, or by ORDERS, which have &s;ome known Laws to authorize them; and whereas this Court conceives THIS ORDER to be no Mandatory Writt warranted by Law, nor knows of no Law that authorizes the making the Order afore&s;aid; &s;o they think them&s;elves under no Obligation to obey it: Which Obedience, they think, would be in them, an opening a Door for arbitrary Commands, which, when once opened, they know not what Dangerous Con&s;equences may attend it. Wherefore this Court conceives it &s;elf bound in Duty (for the Pre&s;ervation of the Rights of this Corporation, and as much as they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n, the Liberty of the Pre&s;s, and the People of the Province, &s;ince an A&s;&s;embly of the Province, and &s;everal Grand Juries, have refu&s;ed to meddle with the Papers, when applied to by the Council) <HI>to prote&s;t again&s;t the ORDER afore&s;aid
<PB N="5" REF="004107_0005_1003C511268F2B88">
and to forbid all the Members of this Corporation, to pay any Obedience to it,</HI> until it be &s;hewn to this Court, that the &s;ame is Authorized by &s;ome known Law, which they neither know nor believe that it is.</P></Q>
<P>Upon reading of which, it was required of the Honourable <HI>Francis Hari&s;on,</HI> Recorder of this Corporation, and one of the Members of the Council, (pre|&s;ent at making &s;aid Order) to &s;hew by what Law or Authority the &s;aid OR|DER was made; upon which he &s;poke in Support of it, and cited the Ca&s;e of Doctor <HI>Sacheverel</HI>'s Sermon, which was by the Hou&s;e of Lords ordered to be burnt by the Hands of the Hangman, and that the Mayor and Aldermen of <HI>London</HI> &s;hould attend the doing of it, To which one of the Aldermen an|&s;wered to this Purpo&s;e; That he conceived the Ca&s;e was no ways parallel, be|cau&s;e Doctor <HI>Sacheverel,</HI> and his Sermon, were impeached by the Hou&s;e of Commons of <HI>England,</HI> which is the Grand Jury of the Nation, and Repre&s;en|tative of the whole People of <HI>England</HI>: That this their Impeachment they pro&s;ecuted before the Hou&s;e of Lords, the greate&s;t Court of Ju&s;tice of <HI>Britain</HI> and which beyond Memory of Man, has had Cognizance of Things of that Nature, that there <HI>Sacheverel</HI> had a fair Hearing in Defence of him&s;elf and of his Sermon. And after that fair Hearing, he and his Sermon were ju&s;tly, fairly and legally condemened; that he had read the Ca&s;e of Dr. <HI>Sacheverel,</HI> &amp; thought he could charge his Memory, that the Judgment of the Hou&s;e of Lords in that Ca&s;e was, That the Mayor and Sheriffs of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Middle&s;ex,</HI> only &s;hould at|tend the Burning of the Sermon, and not the Aldermen; and farther he remembred, that the Order upon that Judgment, was only directed to the Sheriffs of <HI>Lon|don,</HI> and not even to the Mayor, who did not attend the doing it; and farther &s;aid, that would Mr. Recorder &s;how, that the Governour and Council had &s;uch Authority as the Hou&s;e of Lords, and that the Papers ordered to be burnt were in like manner legally pro&s;ecuted and condemned, there the Ca&s;e of Doctor <HI>Sacheverel</HI> might be to the Purpo&s;e; but without &s;hewing that, it rather proved that a Cen&s;ure ought not to be pronounced, till a fair Tryal by a Competent and legal Authority were fir&s;t had. Mr. Recorder was de&s;ired to produce the Books from whence he cited his Authorities, that the Court might judge of them them&s;elves, and was told, that if he could produce &s;ufficient Authorities to warrant <HI>this ORDER,</HI> they would readily obey it, but otherwi&s;e not. Upon which he &s;aid, he did not carry his Books about with him. To which it was an&s;wered, he might &s;end for them, or order a Con&s;table to fetch them. Upon which he aro&s;e, and at the lower End of the Table he mentioned, That Bi&s;hop <HI>Burnet</HI>'s Pa&s;toral Letter, was ordered by the Hou&s;e of Lords, to be burnt by the High Bailiff of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI>; upon which he abruptly went a|way, without waiting for an An&s;wer or promi&s;ing to bring his Books, and did not return &s;itting the Court.</P>
<P>After Mr. Recorder's Departure, it was moved that the <HI>Prote&s;t</HI> &s;hould be en|tered; to which it was an&s;wered, That the <HI>Prote&s;t</HI> could not be entered with|out entering al&s;o the ORDER, and it was not fit to take any Notice of IT, and therefore it was propo&s;ed that no Notice &s;hould be taken in their Books of either, which was unanimou&s;ly agreed to by the Court.</P>
<P>The Sherriff then moved, that the Court would direct their Whipper to perform the &s;aid ORDER; to which it was an&s;wered, That as he was the Of|ficer of the Corporation, they would give no &s;uch <HI>Order.</HI> Soon after which the Court adjourned, and did not attend the Burning of the Papers. Afterwards about Noon, the Sheriff after reading the Numbers of the &s;everal Papers which were ordered to be burnt, delivered them unto the Hands of his own Negroe, and ordered him to put them into the Fire, which he did, at which

And to &s;hew that it was my Right to be &s;o, they offered <HI>Magna Charta, The Petition of Right,</HI> 3 Car. <HI>The</HI> Habeas Corpus <HI>Act of</HI> 31 Car. 2. which directs the Sum in which Bail is to be taken, to be,
<Q>according to the Quality of the Pri&s;oner, and Nature of the Offence.</Q>
Al&s;o 2<HI>d Hawkins,</HI> Cap. 15 &sect;. 5. in the&s;e Words,
<Q>But Ju&s;tices mu&s;t take Care, that under Pretence of de|manding &s;ufficient Security, they do not make &s;o exce&s;&s;ive a Demand, as in Effect amounts to a Denyal of Bail; for this is lookt on as a great Grievance, and is com|plained of as &s;uch, by <HI>1 W.</HI> &amp; <HI>M. Se&s;s. 2d.</HI> by which it is declared, <HI>That ex|ce&s;&s;ive Bail ought not to be required.</HI></Q>
It was al&s;o &s;hewn, that the &s;even Bi|&s;hops, who in King <HI>James</HI> the II<HI>d's</HI> Time, were charged with the like Crime that I &s;tood charged with, were admitted to Bail on their own Recognizances, the Arch-Bi&s;hop in 200 <HI>l.</HI> &amp; each of the other &s;ix in a 100 <HI>l.</HI> apiece only. Sundry other Authorities and Arguments were produced and in&s;i&s;ted on by my Coun|cil, to prove my Right to be admitted to moderate Bail, and to &s;uch Bail as was in my Power to give; and &s;undry Parts of Hi&s;tory they produced, to &s;hew how much the requiring exce&s;&s;ive Bail had been re&s;ented by Parliament.
<PB N="7" REF="004107_0007_1003C516CC833B58">
And in order to Enable the Court to judge what Surety was in my Power to Give, I made Affidavit, <HI>That (my Debts paid) I was not worth Forty Pounds, (the Tools of my Trade and wearing Apparel excepted.)</HI></P>
<P>Some warm Expre&s;&s;ions (to &s;ay no wor&s;e of them) were dropt on this Oc|ca&s;ion, &s;ufficiently known and re&s;ented by the Auditory, which for my Part I de&s;ire may be buried in Oblivion: Upon the whole it was <HI>Ordered that I might be admitted to Bail, my &s;elf in</HI> 400. l. <HI>with two Sureties, each in</HI> 200 l. <HI>and that I &s;hould be remanded till I Gave it.</HI> And as this was Ten Times more, than was in my Power to counter-&s;ecure any Per&s;on in giving Bail for me, I conceived I could not a&s;k any to become my Bail on the&s;e Terms; and therefore I returned to Goal, where I lay until <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> the 28<HI>th</HI> of <HI>January,</HI> 1734,5, be|ing the la&s;t Day of that Term; and the Grand Jury having found nothing a|gain&s;t me, I Expected to have been di&s;charged from my Impri&s;onment: But my Hopes proved vain; for the Attorney General then charged me by <HI>Infor|mation,</HI> for Printing and publi&s;hing Parts, of my Journals No. 13. and 23. as being <HI>fal&s;e, &s;candalous, malicious, and &s;editious.</HI></P>
<P>To this Information my Council appeared, and offered Exceptions, leaving a Blank for in&s;erting the Judges Commi&s;&s;ions, which the Court were of opinion not to receive till tho&s;e Blanks were filled up. In the &s;ucceeding Vacation the Judges gave Copies of their Commi&s;&s;ions; and on <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> the 15<HI>th</HI> of <HI>April</HI> la&s;t, the fir&s;t Day of the &s;ucceeding Term, my Council offered the&s;e Excep|tions; which were as follows.</P>

The Chief Ju&s;tice &s;aid, they conceived the Exceptions were again&s;t the Being of the Court. Both Mr. <HI>Alexander</HI> and Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> denyed that they were, and prayed the Chief Ju&s;tice to point to the Place that contained &s;uch Exception; and further added; That the Court might well exi&s;t, tho' the Commi&s;&s;ions of all the Judges were void; which the Chief Ju&s;tice confe&s;&s;ed to be true: And therefore they prayed a|gain that the Order in that Point might be altered; but it was denied.</P>
<P>Then Mr. <HI>Alexander</HI> de&s;ired to know, whether they <HI>over raded</HI> or <HI>rejected</HI> the Exceptions; the Chief Ju&s;tice &s;aid, he did not under&s;tand the Diffe|rence; to which &s;aid <HI>Alexander</HI> replied, that if he <HI>rejected</HI> the Exceptions, then they could not appear upon the Proceedings, and in that Ca&s;e the Defen|dant was entitled to have them made Part of the Proceedings, by Bill of Ex|ception: But if they <HI>over ruled</HI> them, then by &s;o doing, they only declared them not &s;ufficient, to hinder them from proceeding by virtue of tho&s;e Com|mi&s;&s;ions, and the Exceptions would remain as Records of the Court, and ought to be entered on the Record of the Cau&s;e as Part of the Proceedings. The Chief Ju&s;tice &s;aid, they mu&s;t remain upon the File, to warrant what we have done; as to being Part of the Record of the Proceedings in that Cau&s;e, he &s;aid, you may &s;peak to that Point to morrow.</P>

Notwith|&s;tanding this, the Clerk refu&s;ed to &s;trike the Jury out of the Freeholders Book, and refu&s;ed to hear any Objections to the Per&s;ons on his Li&s;t, but told my Friends, if any Objections they had to any Per&s;ons, they might &s;trike tho&s;e Per&s;ons out; to which they an&s;wered, there would not remain a Jury, if they &s;truck out all the exceptionable Men, and according to the Cu&s;tom, they had only a Right to &s;trike out 12.</P>

and unju&s;tly &s;candalized, as a Per&s;on that has no Regard to Law nor Ju&s;tice; with much more, as will appear upon reading the Information.

<P>Then Mr. <HI>Hamilton,</HI> who at the Reque&s;t of &s;ome of my Friends, was &s;o kind as to come from <HI>Philadelphia</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t me on the Tryal, &s;poke.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Hamilton.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>May it plea&s;e your Honour; I am concerned in this Cau&s;e on the Part of Mr. <HI>Zenger</HI> the Defendant. The Information again&s;t my Client was &s;ent me, a few Days before I left Home, with &s;ome In&s;tructions to let me know how far I might rely upon the Truth of tho&s;e Parts of the Papers &s;et forth in the Information, and which are &s;aid to be libellous. And tho' I am perfectly of the Opinion with the Gentleman who has ju&s;t now &s;poke, on the &s;ame Side with me, as to the common Cour&s;e of Proceedings, I mean in putting Mr. Attorney upon proving, that my Client printed and publi&s;hed tho&s;e Papers mentioned in the Information; yet I cannot think it proper for me (without doing Violence to my own Principles) to deny the Publication of a Complaint, which I think is the Right of every free-born Subject to make, when the Matters &s;o publi&s;hed can be &s;upported with Truth; and therefore I'll &s;ave Mr. Attorney the Trouble of Examining his Witne&s;&s;es to that Point; and I do (for my Client) confe&s;s, that he both printed and publi&s;hed the two News Papers &s;et forth in the Information, and I hope in &s;o doing he has committed no Crime.</P>

<P>Then if Your Honour plea&s;es, &s;ince Mr. <HI>Hamilton</HI> has con|fe&s;&s;ed the Fact, I think our Witne&s;&s;es may be di&s;charged; we have no fur|ther Occa&s;ion for them.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Hamilton.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Not &s;o neither, Mr. Attorney, there are two Words to that Bargain. I hope it is not our bare Printing and Publi&s;hing a Paper, that will make it a Libel: You will have &s;omething more to do, before you make my Client a Libeller; for the Words them&s;elves mu&s;t be libellous, that is, <HI>fal&s;e, &s;candalous, and &s;editious</HI> or el&s;e we are not guilty.</P>
</SP>
<P><HI>As Mr. Attorney has not been plea&s;ed to favour us with his Argument, which he read, or with the Notes of it, we cannot take upon us to &s;et down his Words, but only to &s;hew the Book Ca&s;es he cited, and the general Scope of his Argument, which he drew from tho&s;e Authorities. He ob&s;erved upon the Excellency, as well as U&s;e of Government, and the great Regard and Reverence, which had been con&s;tantly paid to it, both under the Law and the Go&s;pel. That by Go|vernment we were protected in our Lives, Religion and Properties; and that for the&s;e Rea&s;ons, great Care had always been taken to prevent every Thing that might tend to &s;candalize Magi&s;trates, and others concerned in the Admi|ni&s;tration of the Government, e&s;pecially the &s;upream Magi&s;trate. And that there were many In&s;tances of very &s;evere Judgments, and of Puni&s;hments inflicted upon &s;uch, as had attempted to bring the Go|vernment into Contempt; by publi&s;hing fal&s;e and &s;currilous Libels again&s;t it, or by &s;peaking evil and &s;candalous Words of Men in Authority; to the great Di&s;turbance of the publick Peace. And to &s;upport this, he cited <HI>5 Coke 121. (&s;uppo&s;e it &s;hould be 125.) Wood's In&s;tit. 430. 2 Lilly 168. 1 Hawkins 73.11.6.</HI> From the&s;e Books he in&s;i&s;ted, that a Libel was a malicious De|famation of any Per&s;on, expre&s;&s;ed either in Printing or Writing, Signs or Pictures, to a&s;per&s;e the Reputation of one that is alive, or the Memory of one that it dead; if he is a private Man, the Libeller de&s;erves a &s;evere Puni&s;h|ment, but if it is again&s;t a Magi&s;trate or other publick Per&s;on, it it a greater Offence; for this concerns not only the Breach of the Peace, but the Scandal of the Government; for what greater Scandal of Government can there be, than to have corrupt or wicked Magi&s;trates to be appointed by the King, to govern his Subjects under him? And a greater Imputation to the State cannot be, than to &s;uffer &s;uch corrupt Men to &s;it in the &s;acred Seat of Ju&s;tice, or to have any Medling in, or concerning the Admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice: And from the &s;ame Books Mr. Attorney in&s;i&s;ted, that whether the Per&s;on defamed is a private Man or a Magi&s;trate, whether living or Dead, whether the Libel is true or fal&s;e, or if the Party again&s;t whom it is made is of good or evil Fame, it is neverthele&s;s a Libel: For in a &s;ettled State of Government, the Party grieved ought to complain for every Injury done him, in the ordinary Cour&s;e of the Law. And as to its Publication, the Law had taken &s;o great Care of Men's Reputations, that if one maliciou&s;ly repeats it, or &s;ings it in the Pre&s;ence of an other, or delivers the Libel or a Copy of it over, to &s;canda|lize the Party, he is to be puni&s;hed as a Publi&s;her of a Libel. He &s;aid it was likewi&s;e evident, that Libelling was an Offence again&s;t the Law of God. Act. XXIII. <HI>5. Then &s;aid</HI> Paul, <HI>I wi&s;t not Brethren, that he was the High Prie&s;t: For it is written, thou &s;halt not &s;peak evil of the Ruler of the People. 2</HI> Pet. X. <HI>11. De&s;pi&s;e Government, pre&s;umptuous are they, &s;elf willed, they are not afraid to &s;peak evil of Dignities,</HI> &amp;c. He then in&s;i&s;ted that it was clear, both by the Law of God and Man, That it was a very great Offence to &s;peak evil of, or to revile tho&s;e in Authority over us; and that Mr. <HI>Zenger</HI> had offended in a mo&s;t notorious and gro&s;s Manner, in &s;candalizing His Excellency our Governour, who is the King's immediate Repre&s;entative, and the &s;upream Magi&s;trate of this Province: For can there be any Thing more &s;candalous &s;aid of a Governour than what is publi&s;hed in tho&s;e Papers? Nay,

not only the Governour, but both the Council and A&s;&s;embly are &s;candalizen, for there it is plainly &s;aid, That <HI>as Matters now &s;tand, their Liberties and Properties are precarious, and that Slavery is like to be entailed on them and their Po&s;terity.</HI> And then again Mr. <HI>Zenger</HI> &s;ays, <HI>The A&s;&s;embly ought to di&s;pi&s;e the Smiles or Frowns of a Governour; That he thinks the Law is at an End; That we &s;ee Mens Deeds de&s;troyed, Judges arbi|trarily di&s;placed, new Courts erected, without Con&s;ent of the Legi&s;la|ture;</HI> And <HI>That it &s;eems Tryals by Juries are taken away when a Gover|nour plea&s;es; That none can call any Thing their own, longer than tho&s;e in the Admini&s;tration will conde&s;cend to let them do it.</HI> &mdash; And Mr. Attorney added, that he did not know what could be &s;aid in Defence of a Man, that had &s;o notoriou&s;ly &s;candalized the Governour and principal Magi&s;trates and Officers of the Governments, by charging them with depriving the People of their Rights and Liberties, and taking away Tryals by Juries, and in &s;hort, putting an End to the Law it &s;elf. &mdash; If this was not a Libel, he &s;aid, he did not know what was one.

<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Hamilton.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>May it plea&s;e Your Honour; I agree with Mr. Attorney, that Government is a &s;acred Thing, but I differ very widely from him when he would in&s;inuate, that the ju&s;t Complaints of a Number of Men, who &s;uffer under a bad Admini&s;tration, is libelling that Admini&s;tration. Had I believed that to be Law, I &s;hould not have given the Court the Trouble of hearing any Thing that I could &s;ay in this Cau&s;e. I own, when I read the Information, I had not the Art to find our (without the Help of Mr. Attorney's <HI>Innuendo's</HI>) that the Governor was the Per&s;on meant in every Period of that News Paper; and I was inclined to believe, that they were wrote by &s;ome, who from an extra|ordinary Zeal for Liberty, had mi&s;con&s;trued the Conduct of &s;ome Per&s;ons in Authority into Crimes; and that Mr. Attorney out of his too great Zeal for Pow|er, had exhibited this Information, to correct the Indi&s;cretion of my Client; and at the &s;ame Time, to &s;hew his Superiors the great Concern he had, le&s;t they &s;hould be treated with any undue Freedom. But from what Mr. Attor|ney has ju&s;t now &s;aid, <HI>to wit,</HI> That this Pro&s;ecution was directed by the Go|vernor and Council, and from the Extraordinary Appearance of People of all Conditions which I ob&s;erve in Court upon this Occa&s;ion, I have Rea&s;on to think, that tho&s;e in the Admini&s;tration have by this Pro&s;ecution &s;omething more in View, and that the People believe they have a good deal more at &s;take, than I apprehended: And therefore, as it is become my Duty, to be
<PB N="20" REF="004107_0018_1003C5348C493F98">
both plain and particular in this Cau&s;e, I beg Leave to be&s;peak the Patience of the Court.</P>
<P>I was in hopes, as that terrible Court, where tho&s;e dreadful Judgments were given, and that Law e&s;tabli&s;hed, which Mr. Attorney has produced for Authorities to &s;upport this Cau&s;e, was long ago laid a&s;ide, as the mo&s;t dan|gerous Court to the Liberties of the People of <HI>England</HI> that ever was known in that Kingdom; that Mr. Attorney knowing this, would not have attempt|ed to &s;et up a Star-Chamber here, nor to make their Judgments a Precedent to us: For it is well known, that what would have been judg'd Trea&s;on in tho&s;e Days for a Man to &s;peak, I think, has &s;ince not only been practiced as lawful, but the contrary Doctrine has been held to be Law.</P>
<P>In <HI>Brew&s;ter's</HI> Ca&s;e, for Printing, <HI>That the Subjects might defend their Rights and Liberties by Arms, in ca&s;e the King &s;hould go about to de&s;troy them,</HI> he was told by the Chief Ju&s;tice that it was a great Mercy, he was not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a|gain&s;t for his Life; for that to &s;ay, the King could be re&s;i&s;ted by Arms in any Ca&s;e what&s;oever, was expre&s;s Trea&s;on. And yet we &s;ee &s;ince that Time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> <HI>Sacheverell</HI> was &s;entenced in the highe&s;t Court in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> for &s;aving, <HI>That &s;uch a Re&s;i&s;tance was not lawful.</HI> Be&s;ides, as Times have made very great Changes in the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> &s;o in my Opinion there is good Rea&s;on that Places &s;hould do &s;o too.</P>
<P>Is it not &s;urprizing to &s;ee a Subject, upon his receiving a Commi&s;&s;ion from the King to be a Governor of a Colony in <HI>America,</HI> immediately imagining him&s;elf to be ve&s;ted with all the Prerogatives belonging to the &s;acred Per&s;on of his Prince? And which is yet more a&s;toni&s;hing, to &s;ee that a People can be &s;o wild as to allow of and acknowledge tho&s;e Prerogatives and Exemptions, even to their own De&s;truction? Is it &s;o hard a Matter to di&s;tingui&s;h between the Maje&s;ty of our Sovereign, and the Power of a Governor of the Planta|tions? Is not this making very free with our Prince, to apply that Regard, Obedience and Allegiance to a Subject which is due only to Our Sovereign? And yet in all the Ca&s;es which Mr. Attorney has cited, to &s;hew the Duty and Obedience we owe to the Supreme Magi&s;trate, it is the King that is there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ean and under&s;tood, tho' Mr. Attorney is plea&s;ed to urge them as Authorities to prove the Heinou&s;ne&s;s of Mr. <HI>Zenger's</HI> Offence again&s;t the Governor of <HI>New-York.</HI> The &s;everal Plantations are compared to &s;o many large Corporations, and perhaps not improperly; and can any one give an In&s;tance, that the Mayor or H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d of a Corporation, ever put in a Claim to the &s;acred Rights of Maje&s;ty? Let us not (while we are pretending to pay a great Regard to our Prince and His Peace) make bold to transfer that Allegiance to a Subject, which we owe to our King only. What &s;trange Doctrine is it, to pre&s;s every Thing for Law here which is &s;o in <HI>England?</HI> I Believe we &s;hould not think it a Favour, at pre&s;ent at lea&s;t, to e&s;tabli&s;h this Practice. In <HI>England</HI> &s;o great a Regard and Reverence is had to the Judges, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>c.</HI> 3 <HI>In&s;t.</HI> 140.</NOTE> that if any Man &s;trikes another in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall,</HI> while the Judges are &s;itting, he &s;hall lo&s;e his Right Hand, and forfeit his Land and Goods, for &s;o doing. And tho' the Judges here claim all the Powers and Authorities within this Government, that a Court of King's Bench has in <HI>England,</HI> yet I believe Mr. Attorney will &s;carcely &s;ay, that &s;uch a Puni&s;hment could be legally inflicted on a Man for committing &s;uch an Offence, in the Pre&s;ence of the Judges &s;it|ting in any Court within the Province of <HI>New-York.</HI> The Rea&s;on is obvious; a Quarrel or Riot in <HI>New-York</HI> cannot po&s;&s;ibly be attended with tho&s;e dan|gerous Con&s;equences that it might in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall</HI>; nor (I hope) will it be alledged, that any Mi&s;behaviour to a Governor in the Plantations will, or
<PB N="21" REF="004107_0019_1003C5368C5EE690">
ought to be, judged of or puni&s;hed, as a like Undutifulne&s;s would be, to Our Sovereign. From all which, I hope Mr. Atttorney will not think it proper to apply his Law-Ca&s;es (to &s;upport the Cau&s;e of his Governor) which have only been judged, where the King's Safety or Honour was concerned. It will not be denied but that a Freeholder in the Province of <HI>New-York</HI> has as good a Right to the &s;ole and &s;eparate U&s;e of his Lands, as a Freeholder in <HI>England,</HI> who has a Right to bring an Action of Tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t his Neighbour, for &s;uffering his Hor&s;e or Cow to come and feed upon his Land, or eat his Corn, whether inclo&s;ed or not inclu&s;ed; and yet I believe it would be looked upon as a &s;trange Attempt, for one Man here, to bring an Action again&s;t another, who&s;e Cattle and Hor&s;es feed upon his Grounds not inclo&s;ed, or indeed for eating and treading down his Corn, if that were not inclo&s;ed. Numberle&s;s are the In&s;tances of this Kind that might be given, to &s;hew, that what is good Law at one Time and in one Place, is not &s;o at another Time and in another Place; &s;o that I think, the Law &s;eems to expect, that in the&s;e Parts of the World Men &s;hould take Care, by a good Fence, to pre&s;erve their Property, from the Injury of unruly Bea&s;ts. And perhaps there may be as good Rea&s;on why Men &s;hould take the &s;ame Care, to make an hone&s;t and upright Conduct a Fence and Security again&s;t the Injury of unruly Tongues.</P>

<P>I don't know what the Gentleman means, by comparing Ca&s;es of Freeholders in <HI>England</HI> with Freeholders here. What has this Ca&s;e to do with Actions of Tre&s;pa&s;s, or Men's Fencing their Ground? The Ca&s;e before the Court is, whether Mr. <HI>Zenger</HI> is guilty of Libelling His Excellency the Governor of <HI>New-York,</HI> and indeed the whole Admini&s;tration of the Go|vernment? Mr. <HI>Hamilton</HI> has confe&s;&s;ed the Printing and Publi&s;hing, and I think nothing is plainer, than that the Words in the Information are <HI>&s;candal|ous, and tend to &s;edition, and to di&s;quiet the Minds of the People of this Province.</HI> And if &s;uch Papers are not Libels, I think it may be &s;aid, there can be no &s;uch Thing as a Libel.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Attorney.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think I did not omit the Word <HI>fal&s;e:</HI> But it has been &s;aid already, that it may be a Libel, notwith&s;tanding it may be true.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Hamilton.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>In this I mu&s;t &s;till differ with Mr. Attorney; for I depend upon it, we are to be tried upon this Information now before the Court and Jury, and to which we have pleaded <HI>Not Guilty,</HI> and by it we are charged with Printing and publi&s;hing <HI>a certain fal&s;e, malicious, &s;editious and &s;candalous Libel.</HI> This Word <HI>fal&s;e</HI> mu&s;t have &s;ome Meaning, or el&s;e how came it there? I hope Mr. Attorney will not &s;ay, he put it there by Chance, and I am of Opinion his Information would not be good without it. But to &s;hew that it is the principal Thing which, in my Opinion, makes a Libel, I put the Ca&s;e, the Information had been for printing and publi&s;hing a certain <HI>true</HI> Libel, would that be the &s;ame Thing? Or could Mr. Attorney &s;upport &s;uch an In|formation by any Precedent in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Law? No, the Fal&s;hood makes the Scandal, and both make the Libel. And to &s;hew the Court that I am in good Earne&s;t, and to &s;ave the Court's Time, and Mr. Attorney's Trouble, I will agree, that if he can prove the Facts charged upon us, to be <HI>fal&s;e,</HI> I'll
<PB N="22" REF="004107_0020_1003C53870CCFF08">
own them to be <HI>&s;candalous, &s;editious</HI> and <HI>a Libel.</HI> So the Work &s;eeme now to be pretty much &s;hortned, and Mr. Attorney has now only to prove the Words <HI>fal&s;e,</HI> in order to make us Guilty.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. Attorney.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have nothing to prove; you have confe&s;&s;ed the Print|ing and Publi&s;hing; but if it was nece&s;&s;ary (as I in&s;i&s;t it it is not) how can we prove a Negative? But I hope &s;ome Regard will be had to the Authorities that have been produced, and that &s;uppo&s;ing all the Words to be true, yet that will not help them, that Chief Ju&s;tice <HI>Holt</HI> in his Charge to the Jury, in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Tutchin,</HI> made no Di&s;tinction, whether <HI>Tutchin</HI>'s Papers were <HI>true</HI> or <HI>fal&s;e</HI>; and as Chief Ju&s;tice <HI>Holt</HI> has made no Di&s;tinction in that Ca&s;e, &s;o none ought to be made here; nor can it be &s;hewn in all that Ca&s;e, there was any Que&s;tion made about their being <HI>fal&s;e</HI> or <HI>true.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Hamilton.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I did expect to hear, That a Negative cannot be proved; but every Body knows there are many Exceptions to that general Rule: For if a Man is charged with killing another, or &s;tealing his Neighbour's Hor&s;e, if he is innocent in the one Ca&s;e, he may prove the Man &s;aid to be killed, to be really alive; and the Hor&s;e &s;aid to be &s;toln, never to have been out of his Ma&s;ter's Stable, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and this I think is proving a Negative. But we will &s;ave Mr. Attorney the Trouble of proving a Negative, and take the <HI>Onus pro|b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"></HI> upon our &s;elves, and prove tho&s;e very Papers that are called Libels to be <HI>true.</HI></P>

Do not we in&s;i&s;t that the Fal&s;hod makes the Scandal, and both make the Libel? And how &s;hall it be known whether the Words are libelous, <HI>that is, true</HI> or <HI>fal&s;e,</HI> but by admitting us to prove them <HI>true,</HI> &s;ince Mr. Attorney will not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> prove them <HI>fal&s;e</HI>? Be&s;ides, is it not again&s;t common Sen&s;e, that a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;hould be puni&s;hed in the &s;ame Degree for a <HI>true Libel</HI> (if any &s;uch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> be) as for a <HI>fal&s;e one?</HI> I know it is &s;aid, <HI>That Truth makes a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> provoking, and therefore the Offence is the greater, and con&s;equently the Judgment &s;hould be the heavier.</HI> Well, &s;uppo&s;e it were &s;o, and let us agree for once, <HI>That Truth is a greater Sin than Fal&s;hood:</HI> Yet as the Offences are not equal, and as the Puni&s;hment is arbitrary, <HI>that is,</HI> according as the Judges in their Di&s;cretion &s;hall direct to be inflicted; is it not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that they &s;hould know, whether the Libel is <HI>true</HI> or <HI>fal&s;e,</HI> that they may by that Means be able to proportion the Puni&s;hment? For, would it not be a &s;ad Ca&s;e, if the Judges, for want of a due Information, &s;hould chance to give as &s;evere a Judgment again&s;t a Man for writing or publi&s;hing a Lie, as for writ|ing or publi&s;hing a Truth? And yet this (with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion) as mon&s;trous and ridiculous as it may &s;eem to be, is the natural Con&s;equence of Mr. Attorney's Doctrine, <HI>That Truth makes a wor&s;e Libel than Fal&s;hood,</HI> and mu&s;t follow from his not proving our Papers to be <HI>fal&s;e,</HI> or not &s;uffering us to prove them to be <HI>true.</HI> But this is only rea&s;oning upon the Ca&s;e, and I will now proceed to &s;hew, what in my Opinion will be &s;ufficient to induce the Court, to allow us to prove the Truth of the Words, which in the Information are called libellous. And fir&s;t, I think there cannot be a greater Authority for us, than the Judg|ment I ju&s;t now mentioned, in the Ca&s;e of <HI>John de Northampton,</HI> and that was in early Times, and before the Star Chamber came to its Fulne&s;s of Power and Wickedne&s;s. In that Judgment, as I ob&s;erved, the <HI>Fal&s;hood</HI> of the Letter which was wrote, is a&s;&s;igned as the very Ground of the Sentence. And a|greeable to this it was urged by Sir <HI>Robert Sawyer,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>State Tryals,</HI> Vol. 4.</NOTE> in the Tryal of the Seven Bi&s;hops, <HI>That the Fal&s;ity, the Malice, and Sedition of the Writing, were all Facts to be proved.</HI> But here it may be &s;aid, Sir <HI>Robert</HI> was one of the Bi&s;hop's Council, and his Argument is not to be allowed for Law: But I offer it only to &s;hew that we are not the fir&s;t who have in&s;i&s;ted, that to make a Writing a Libel, it mu&s;t be <HI>fal&s;e.</HI> And if the Argument of a Council mu&s;t have no Weight, I hope there will be more Regard &s;hewn to the Opinion of a Judge, and therefore I mention the Words of Ju&s;tice <HI>Powel</HI> in the &s;ame Tryal, where he &s;ays (of the Petition of the Bi&s;hops, which was called a Libel, and upon which they were pro&s;ecut|ed by Information) That <HI>to make it a Libel, it mu&s;t be fal&s;e and malicious, and tend to Sedition</HI>; and declared, <HI>as he &s;aw no Fal&s;hood or Malice in it, he was of Opinion, that it was no Libel.</HI> Now I &s;hould think this Opinion alone, in the Ca&s;e of the King, and in a Ca&s;e which that King had &s;o much at Heart, and

<P>Sure, Mr. Attorney, you won't make any Applications; all Men agree that we are governed by the be&s;t of Kings, and I cannot &s;ee the Meaning of Mr. Attorney's Caution; my well known Principles, and the Sen&s;e I have of the Ble&s;&s;ings we enjoy under His pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, makes it impo&s;&s;ible for me to err, and I hope, even to be &s;u&s;pected, in that Point of Duty to my King. May it plea&s;e Your Honour, I was &s;aying, That notwith|&s;tanding all the Duty and reverence claimed by Mr. Attorney to Men in Au|thority, they are not exempt from ob&s;erving the Rules of common Ju&s;tice, either in their private or publick Capacities; the Laws of our Mother Coun|try know no Exemption. It is true, Men in Power are harder to be come at for Wrongs they do, either to a private Per&s;on, or to the publick; e&s;pecially a Governour in the Plantations, where they in&s;i&s;t upon an Exemption from an&s;wering Complaints of any Kind in their own Government. We are indeed told, and it is true they are obliged to an&s;wer a Suit in the King's Courts at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> for a Wrong done to any Per&s;on here: But do we not know how impracticable this is to mo&s;t Men among us, to leave their Families (who de|pend upon their Labour and Care for their Livelihood) and carry Evidences to <HI>Britain,</HI> and at a great, nay, a far greater Expence than almo&s;t any of us are able to bear, only to pro&s;ecute a Governour for an Injury done here. But when the Oppre&s;&s;ion is general there is no Remedy even that Way, no, our Con&s;titution has (ble&s;&s;ed be God) given us an Opportunity, if not to have &s;uch Wrongs redre&s;&s;ed, yet by our Prudence and Re&s;olution we may in a great Mea&s;ure prevent the committing of &s;uch Wrongs, by making a Governour &s;en&s;i|ble that it is his intere&s;t to be ju&s;t to tho&s;e under his Care; for &s;uch is the Sen&s;e that Men in General (I mean Freemen) have of common Ju&s;tice, that when they come to know, that a chief Magi&s;trate abu&s;es the Power with which he is tru&s;ted, for the good of the People, and is attempting to turn that very Power again&s;t the Innocent, whether of high or low degree, I &s;ay, Mankind in general &s;eldom fail to interpo&s;e, and as far as they can, prevent the De|&s;truction of their fellow Subjects. And has it not often been &s;een (and I hope it will always be &s;een) that when the Repre&s;entatives of a free People are by ju&s;t Repre&s;entations or Remon&s;trances, made &s;en&s;ible of the Sufferings of their Fellow-Subjects, by the Abu&s;e of Power in the Hands of a Governour, they have declared (and loudly too) that they were not obliged by any Law to &s;upport a Governour who goes about to de&s;troy a Province or Colony, or their

Have you not a Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives to whom you may complaint?</HI> And to this I an|&s;wer, we have. But what then? Is an A&s;&s;embly to be troubled with every Injury done by a Governour? Or are they to hear of nothing but what tho&s;e in the Admini&s;tration will plea&s;e to tell them? Or what Sort of a Tryal mu&s;t a Man have? And how is he to be remedied; e&s;pecially if the Ca&s;e were, as I have known it to happen in <HI>America</HI> in my Time; That a Governour who has Places (I will not Pen&s;ions, for I believe they &s;eldom give that to another which they can take to them&s;elves) to be&s;tow, and can or will keep the &s;ame A&s;&s;embly (after he has modeled them &s;o as to get a Majority of the Hou&s;e in his Inte|re&s;t) for near <HI>twice Seven Years</HI> together? I pray, what Redre&s;s is to be ex|pected for an hone&s;t Man, who makes his Complaint again&s;t a Governour, to an A&s;&s;embly who may properly enough be &s;aid, to be made by the &s;ame Go|vernour again&s;t whom the Complaint is made? The Thing an&s;wers it &s;elf. No, it is natural, it is a Priviledge, I will go farther, it is a Right which all Freemen claim, and are entitled to complain when they are hurt; they have a Right publickly to remon&s;trate the Abu&s;es of Power, in the &s;tronge&s;t Terms, to put their Neighbours upon their Guard, again&s;t the Craft or open Violence of Men in Authority, and to a&s;&s;ert with Courage the Sen&s;e they have of the Ble&s;&s;ings of Liberty, the Value they put upon it, and their Re&s;olution at all Hazards to pre&s;erve it, as one of the greate&s;t Ble&s;&s;ings Heaven can be&s;tow. And when a Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly compo&s;ed of hone&s;t Freemen &s;ees the general Bent of the Peoples Inclinations, That is it which mu&s;t and will (I'm &s;ure it ought to) weigh with a Legi&s;lature, in Spite of all the Craft, Carre&s;&s;ing and Cajoling, made u&s;e of by a Governour, to divert them from hearkning to the Voice of their Country. As we all very well under&s;tand the true Rea&s;on, why Gentlemen take &s;o much Pains and make &s;uch great Intere&s;t to be ap|pointed Governours, &s;o is the De&s;ign of their Apointment not le&s;s manife&s;t. We know his Maje&s;ty's gracious Intentions to his Subjects; he de&s;ires no more than that his People in the Plantations &s;hould be kept up to their Duty and Allegiance to the Crown of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> that Peace may be pre&s;erved a|mong&s;t them, and Ju&s;tice impartially admini&s;tred; that we may be governed &s;o as to render us u&s;eful to our Mother Country, by encouraging us to make and rai&s;e &s;uch Commodities as may be u&s;eful to <HI>Great Britain.</HI> But will any one &s;ay, that all or any of the&s;e good Ends are to be effected, by a Gover|nour's &s;etting his People together by the Ears, and by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of one Part of the People to plague and plunder the other? The Commi&s;&s;ion which Governours bear, while they execute the Powers given them, according to the Intent of the Royal Grantor, expre&s;&s;ed in their Commi&s;&s;ions, requires and de&s;erves very great Reverence and Submi&s;&s;ion; but when a Governour de|parts from the Duty enjoyned him by his Sovereign, and acts as if he was le&s;s accountable than the Royal Hand that gave him all that Power and Honour which he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of; this &s;ets People upon examining and en|quiring into the Power, Authority and Duty of &s;uch a Magi&s;trate, and to compare tho&s;e with his Conduct, and ju&s;t as far as they find he exceeds the Bounds of his Authority, or falls &s;hort in doing impartial Ju&s;tice to the Peo|ple under his Admini&s;tration, &s;o far they very often, in return, come &s;hort in their Duty to &s;uch a Governour. For Power alone will not make a Man beloved, and I have heard it ob&s;erved. That the Man who was neither good
<PB N="30" REF="004107_0028_1003C54EC79A3A60">
nor wi&s;e before his being made a Governour, never mended upon his Prefer|ment, but has been generally ob&s;erved to be wor&s;e: For Men who are not endued with Wi&s;dom and Virtue, can only be kept in Bounds by the Law; and by how much the further they think them&s;elves out of the Reach of the Law, by &s;o much the more wicked and cruel Men are. I wi&s;h there were no In&s;tances of the Kind at this Day. And wherever this happens to be the Ca&s;e of a Governour, unhappy are the People under his Admini&s;tration, and in the End he will find him&s;elf &s;o too; for the People will neither love him nor &s;upport him. I make no Doubt but there are tho&s;e here, who are zea|lou&s;ly concerned for the Succe&s;s of this Pro&s;ecution, and yet I hope they are not many, and even &s;ome of tho&s;e, I am per&s;waded (when they con&s;ider what Lengths &s;uch Pro&s;ecutions may be carried, and how deeply the Liber|ties of the People may be affected by &s;uch Means) will not all abide by their pre&s;ent Sentiments; I &s;ay, <HI>Not All:</HI> For the Man who from an Intimacy and Acquaintance with a Governour has conceived a per&s;onal Regard for him, the Man who has felt none of the Strokes of his Power, the Man who believes that a Governour has a Regard for him and confides in him, it is natural for &s;uch Men to wi&s;h well to the Affairs of &s;uch a Governour; and as they may be Men of Honour and Genero&s;ity, may, and no Doubt will, wi&s;h him Suc|ce&s;s, &s;o far as the Rights and Priviledges of their Fellow Citizens are not affected. But as Men of Honour, I can apprehend nothing from them; they will never exceed that Point. There are others that are under &s;tronger Obli|gations, and tho&s;e are &s;uch, as are in &s;ome Sort engaged in Support of a Go|vernor's Cau&s;e, by their own or their Relations Dependance on his Favour, for &s;ome Po&s;t or Preferment; &s;uch Men have what is commonly called Duty and Gratitude, to influence their Inclinations, and oblige them to go his Lengths. I know Men's Intere&s;ts are very near to them, and they will do much, rather than forgoe the Favour of a Governour, and a Livelihood at the &s;ame Time; but I can with very ju&s;t Grounds hope, even from tho&s;e Men, whom I will &s;uppo&s;e to be Men of Honour and Con&s;cience too, that when they, the Liberty of their Country is in Danger, either by their Concurrence, or even by their Silence, they will like <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> and like them&s;elves, freely make a Sacrifice of any Preferment or Favour rather than be acce&s;&s;ary to de&s;troying the Liberties of their Country, and entailing Sla|very upon their Po&s;terity. There are indeed another &s;et of Men, of whom I have no Hopes, I mean &s;uch, who lay a&s;ide all other Con&s;iderations, and are ready to joyn with Power in any Shapes, and with any Man or Sort of Men, by who&s;e Means or Intere&s;t they may be a&s;&s;i&s;ted to gratify their Malice and Envy again&s;t tho&s;e whom they have been plea&s;ed to hate; and that for no other Rea&s;on, but becau&s;e they are Men of Abilities and Integrity, or at lea&s;t are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;ome valuable Qualities far &s;uperiour to their own. But as Envy is the Sin of the Devil, and therefore very hard, if at all, to be repented, of, I will believe there are but few of this dete&s;table and worthle&s;s Sort of Men, nor will their Opinions or Inclinations have any Influence upon this Tryal. But to proceed; I beg Leave to in&s;i&s;t, That the Right of complaining or remon&s;trat|ing is natural; And the Re&s;traint upon this natural Right is the Law only, and that tho&s;e Re&s;traints can only extend to what is <HI>fal&s;e:</HI> For as it is Truth alone which can excu&s;e or ju&s;tify any Man for complaining of a bad Admi|ni&s;tration, I as frankly agree, that nothing ought to excu&s;e a Man who rai&s;es a fal&s;e Charge or Accu&s;ation, even again&s;t a private Per&s;on, and that no man|ner of Allowance ought to be made to him, who does &s;o again&s;t a publick Magi&s;trate. <HI>Truth</HI> ought to govern the whole Affair of Libels, and yet the Party accu&s;ed runs Ri&s;que enough even then; for if he fails of proving every Tittle
<PB N="31" REF="004107_0029_1003C552E284A798">
of what he has wrote, and to the Satisfaction of the Court and Jury too, he may find to his Co&s;t, that when the Pro&s;ecution is &s;et or Foot by Men in Power, it &s;eldom wants Friends to Favour it. And from thence (it is &s;aid) has ari&s;en the great Diver&s;ity of Opinions among Judges, about what Words were or were not &s;candalous or libelious. I believe will be granted, that there is not greater Uncertainty in any Part of the Law, than about Words of &s;candal; it would be mi&s;pending of the Court's Time to mention the Ca&s;es; they may be &s;aid to be numberle&s;s; and therefore the utmo&s;t Care ought to be taken in following Precedents; and the Times when the Judgments were given, which are quoted for Authorities in the Ca&s;e of Libels, are much to be regarded. I think it will be agreed, That ever &s;ince the Time of the Star Chamber, where the mo&s;t arbitrary and de&s;tructive Judgments and Opinions were given, that ever an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> heard of, at le&s;t in his own Country: I &s;ay, Pro&s;ecutions for Libels &s;ince the Time of that arbitrary Court, and un|til the glorious Revolution, have generally been &s;et on Foot at the In&s;tance of the Crown or its Mini&s;ters; and it is no &s;mall Reproach to the Law, that the&s;e Pro&s;ecutions were too often and too much countenanced by the Judges, who held their Places at Plea&s;ure, (a di&s;agreeable Tenure to any Officer, but a danger|ous one in the Ca&s;e of a Judge.) To &s;ay more to this Point may not be pro|per. And yet I cannot think it unwarrantable, to &s;hew the unhappy Influence that a Sovereign has &s;ometimes had, not only upon Judges, but even upon Parliaments them&s;elves.</P>
<P>It has already been &s;hewn, how the Judges differed in their Opinions about the Nature of a Libel, in the Ca&s;e of the &s;even Bi&s;hops. There you &s;ee three Judges of one Opinion, that is, of a wrong Opinion, in the Judgment of the be&s;t Men in <HI>England,</HI> and one Judge of a right Opinion. How unhappy might it have been for all of us at this Day, if that Jury had under&s;tood the Words in that Information as the Court did? Or if they had left it to the Court, to judge whether the Petition of the Bi&s;hops was or was not a Libel? No they took upon them, to their immortal Honour! to deter|mine both <HI>Law</HI> and <HI>Fact,</HI> and to <HI>under&s;tand</HI> the Petition of the Bi&s;hops <HI>to be no Libel, that is, to contain no fal&s;hood nor Sedition,</HI> and therefore found them <HI>Not Guilty.</HI> And remarkable is the Ca&s;e of Sir <HI>Samuel Barnardi&s;ton,</HI> who was fined 10,000 <HI>L.</HI> for Writing a Letter, in which, it may be &s;aid, none &s;aw any Scandal or Fal&s;hood but the Court and Jury; for that Judgment was af|terwards looked upon as a cruel and dete&s;table Judgment, and therefore was rever&s;ed by Parliament. Many more In&s;tances might be given of the Com|plai&s;ance of Court-Judges, about tho&s;e Times and before; but I will mention only one Ca&s;e more, and that is the Ca&s;e of Sir <HI>Edward Hales,</HI> who tho' a <HI>Roman Catholick,</HI> was by King <HI>James</HI> II. prefered to be a Colonel of his Army, notwith&s;tanding the Statute of 25 <HI>Cha.</HI> 2<HI>d. Chap.</HI> 2. by which it is provided, <HI>That every one that accepts of an Office, Civil or Military, &amp;c. &s;hall take the Oaths, &s;ub&s;cribe the Declaration, and take the Sacrament, within three Months, &amp;c. o|therwi&s;e he is di&s;abled to hold &s;uch Office, and the Grant for the &s;ame to be null and void, and the Party to forfeit</HI> 500 l. Sir <HI>Edward Hales</HI> did not take the Oaths or Sacrament, and was pro&s;ecuted for the 500 <HI>l.</HI> for exerci&s;ing the Of|fice of a Colonel by the Space of three Months, without conforming as in the Act is directed. Sir <HI>Edward</HI> pleads. <HI>That the King by His Letters Patents did di&s;pence with his taking the Oaths and Sacrament, and &s;ub&s;cribing the Declaration, and had pardoned the forfeiture of</HI> 500 <HI>l.</HI> And <HI>whether the King's Di&s;|pen&s;ation was good, again&s;t the &s;aid Act of Parliament?</HI> was the Que&s;tion. I &s;hall mention no more of this Ca&s;e, than to &s;hew how in the Reign of an arbitrary Prince, where Judges hold their Seats at Plea&s;ure, their Determina|tions
<PB N="32" REF="004107_0030_1003C555498B63D0">
have not always been &s;uch as to make Precedents of, but the Contrary; and &s;o it happened in this Ca&s;e where it was &s;olemnly judged, <HI>That, notwith|&s;tanding this Act of Parliament, made in the &s;tronge&s;t Terms, for Pre&s;ervation of the Prote&s;tant Religion, That yet the King had, by his Royal Prerogative, a Power to di&s;pence with that Law</HI>; and Sir <HI>Edward Hales</HI> was acquitted by the Judges accordingly. So the King's Di&s;pen&s;ing Power, being by the Judges &s;et up a|bove the Act of Parliament, this Law, which the People looked upon as their chief Security again&s;t Popery and Arbitrary Power, was by this Judgment rendred altogether ineffectual. But this Judgment is &s;ufficiently expo&s;ed by Sir <HI>Edward Atkins,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir <HI>Edw. Atkins's</HI> Enquiry into the Power of Di&s;pen&s;ing with paenal Statutes.</NOTE> late one of the Judges of the Court of Common Pleas in his <HI>Enquiry into the King's Power of di&s;pen&s;ing with paenal Statutes</HI>; where it is &s;hewn, <HI>Who it was that fir&s;t in|vented Di&s;pen&s;ations; how they came into</HI> England; <HI>what ill U&s;e has been made of them there; and all this principally owing to the Countenance given them by the Judges.</HI> He &s;ays of the Di&s;pen&s;ing Power, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Po&s;t&s;cript to the <HI>Enquiry, pag.</HI> 51.</NOTE> <HI>The Pope was the Inventor of it; our Kings have borrowed it from them; and the Judges have from Time to Time nur&s;ed and dre&s;&s;ed it up, and given it Countenance; and it is &s;till u|pon the Growth, and encroaching 'till it has almo&s;t &s;ubverted all Law, and made the Regal Power ab&s;olute if not di&s;olute.</HI> This &s;eems not only to &s;hew how far Judges have been influenced by Power, and how little Ca&s;es of this Sort, where the Prerogative has been in Que&s;tion in former Reigns, are to be relied upon for Law: But I think it plainly &s;hews too, that a Man may u&s;e a greater Freedom with the Power of His Sovereign and the Judges in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> than it &s;eems he may with the Power of a Governour in the Plantations, who is but a Fellow-Subject. Are the&s;e Words with which we are charged, like the&s;e? Do Mr. <HI>Zenger's</HI> Papers contain any &s;uch Freedoms with his Go|vernour or His Council, as Sir <HI>Edward Atkins</HI> has taken, with the Regal Power and the Judges in <HI>England?</HI> And yet I never heard of any Information brought again&s;t him for the&s;e Freedoms.</P>
<P>If then upon the whole there is &s;o great an Uncertainty among Judges (learned and great Men) in Matters of this Kind; If Power has had &s;o great an Influence on Judges; how cautious ought we to be in determining by their Judgments, e&s;pecially in the Plantations, and in the Ca&s;e of Libels? There is Here&s;y in Law, as well as in Religion, and both have changed very much; and we well know that it is not two Centuries ago that a Man would have been burnt as an Heretick, for owning &s;uch Opinions in Matters of Religion as are publickly wrote and printed at this Day. They were fallible Men, it &s;eems, and we take the Liberty not only to differ from them in religious Opinions, but to condemn them and their Opinions too; and I mu&s;t pre&s;ume, that in taking the&s;e Freedoms in thinking and &s;peaking about Matters of Faith or Reli|gion, we are in the right: For, tho' it is &s;aid there are very great Liberties of this Kind taken in <HI>NeweYork,</HI> yet I have heard of no Information prefered by Mr. Attorney for any Offences of this Sort. From which I think it is pretty clear, That in <HI>New-York</HI> a Man may make very free with his God, but he mu&s;t take &s;pecial Care what he &s;ays of his Governour. It is agreed upon by all Men that this is a Reign of Liberty, and while Men keep within the Bounds of Truth, I hope they may with Safety both &s;peak and write their Sentiments of the Conduct of Men in Power, I men of that Part of their Conduct only, which affects the Liberty or Property of the People under their Admini&s;tration; were this to be denied, then the next Step may make them Slaves: For what Notions can be entertained of Slavery, beyond that of &s;uffering the greate&s;t Injuries and Oppre&s;&s;ions, without the Liberty of complaining; or if they do, to be de&s;troyed, Body and E&s;tate, for &s;o doing?</P>

I will give two In&s;tances: and as they are Authorities not to be denied, nor can be mi&s;under&s;tood, I pre|&s;ume they will be &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> is the Statute of 3 <HI>l.</HI> of <HI>Hen.</HI> 7. <HI>Cap.</HI> 1. The Preamble of the Sta|tute will prove all, and more than I have alledged. It begins,
<Q>The King Our Sovereign Lord remembereth how by unlawful Maintenances, giving of Li|veries, Signs and Tokens, &amp;c. untrue Demeanings of Sheriffs in making of Pan|nels, and other untrue Returns, by taking of Money, by Injuries, by great Riots and unlawful A&s;&s;emblies; the Policy and good Rule of this Realm is almo&s;t &s;ub|dued; and for the not puni&s;hing the&s;e Inconveniences, and by Occa&s;ion of the Pre|mi&s;&s;es, little or nothing may be found by Inquiry, &amp;c. to the increa&s;e of Murders, &amp;c. and un&s;ureties of all Men living, and Lo&s;&s;es of their Lands and Good<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</Q>
Here is a fine and &s;pecious Pretence for introducing the Remedy, as it is call|ed, which is provided by this Act, <HI>that is</HI>; in&s;tead of being lawfully accu&s;ed by 24 good and lawful Men of the Neighbourhood, and afterwards tried by 12 like lawful Men, here is a Power given to the Lord Chancellor, Lord Trea&s;urer, the Keeper of the King's privy Seal, or two of them, calling to them a Bi&s;hop, a temporal Lord, and other great Men mentioned in the Act, (who, it is to be ob&s;erved, were all to be Dependants on the Court) to receive Information again&s;t any Per&s;on for any of the Mi&s;behaviours recited in that Act, and by their Di&s;cretion to examine, and to puni&s;h them according to their demerit.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Statute I propo&s;ed to mention, is the 11<HI>th</HI> of the &s;ame King, <HI>Chap.</HI> 3<HI>d.</HI> the Preamble of which Act has the like fair Pretences as the former; <HI>for the King calling to his Remembrance the good Laws made again&s;t the receiving of Liveries, &amp;c. unlawful Extortions, Maintenances, Embracery, &amp;c. unlawful Games, &amp;c. and many other great Enormitys, and Offences committed again&s;t many good Statutes, to the Di&s;plea&s;ure of Almighty God, which,</HI> the Act &s;ays, <HI>could not, nor yet can, be conveniently puni&s;hed by the due Order of the Law, except it were fir&s;t found by</HI> 12 <HI>Men, &amp;c. which, for the Cau&s;es afore&s;aid, will not find nor yet pre&s;ent the Truth.</HI> And therefore the &s;ame Statute directs, <HI>that the Ju&s;tices of A&s;|&s;ize, and Ju&s;tices of the Peace, &s;hall, upon Information for the King before them made, have full Power, by their Di&s;cretion, to hear and determine all &s;uch Offences.</HI> Here are two Statutes that are allowed to have given the deepe&s;t Wound to the Liberties of the People of <HI>England</HI> of any that I remember to have been made, unle&s;s it may be &s;aid, that the Statute made in the Time of <HI>Henry</HI> 8<HI>th,</HI> by which his Proclamations were to have the Effect of Laws, might in its Con|&s;equence

be wor&s;e. And yet we &s;ee the plau&s;ible Pretences found out by the great Men to procure the&s;e Acts. And it may ju&s;tly be &s;aid, That by tho&s;e Pretences the People of <HI>England</HI> were cheated or aw'd into the Delivering up their antient and &s;acred Right of Tryals by Grand and Petit Juries. I hope to be excu&s;ed for this Expre&s;&s;ion, &s;eeing my Lord <HI>Coke</HI> calls it <HI>an un|ju&s;t and &s;trange Act,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">4. <HI>In&s;t.</HI></NOTE> <HI>that tended in its Execution to the great Di&s;plea|&s;ure of Almighty God, and the utter Subver&s;ion of the common Law.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e, I think, make out what I alledged, and are flagrant In&s;tances of the Influence of Men in Power, even upon the Repre&s;entatives of a whole King|dom. From all which I hope it will be agreed, that it is a Duty which all good Men owe to their Country, to guard again&s;t the unhappy Influence of ill Men when intru&s;ted with Power, and e&s;pecially again&s;t their Creatures and Dependants, who, as they are generally more nece&s;&s;itous, are &s;urely more covetous and cruel. But it is worthy of Ob&s;ervation, that tho' the Spirit of Liberty was born down and oppre&s;&s;ed in <HI>England</HI> at that Time, yet it was not lo&s;t; for the Parliament laid hold of the fir&s;t Opportunity to free the Subject from the many in&s;ufferable Oppre&s;&s;ions and Outrages committed upon their Per|&s;ons and E&s;tates by Colour of the&s;e Acts, the la&s;t of which being deemed the mo&s;t grievous, was repealed in the fir&s;t Year of <HI>Hen.</HI> 8<HI>th.</HI> Tho' it is to be ob|&s;erved, that <HI>Hen.</HI> 7<HI>th.</HI> and his Creatures reap'd &s;uch great Advantages by the grievous Oppre&s;&s;ions and Exactions, <HI>grinding the Faces of the poor Subjects,</HI> as my Lord <HI>Coke</HI> &s;ays, by Colour of this Stature by information only, that a Repeal of this Act could never be obtained during the Life of that Prince. The other Statute being the favourite Law for Supporting arbitrary Power, was continued much longer. The Execution of it was by the great Men of the Realm; and how they executed it, the Sen&s;e of the Kingdom, expre&s;&s;ed in the 17<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Charles</HI> 1<HI>st.</HI> (by which the Court of Star Chamber, the Soil where Informations grew ranke&s;t) will be&s;t declare. In that Statute <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> and the other Statutes made in the Time of <HI>Edw.</HI> 3 <HI>l.</HI> which I think, are no le&s;s than five, are particularly enumerated as Acts, by which the Li|berties and Priviledges of the People of <HI>England</HI> were &s;ecured to them, again&s;t &s;uch oppre&s;&s;ive Courts as the Star Chamber and others of the like Juri&s;diction. And the Rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned for their pulling down the Star Chamber, is <HI>That the Proceedings, Cen&s;ures and Decrees of the Court of Star Chamber, even tho' the great Men of the Realm, nay and a Bi&s;hop too</HI> (holy Man) <HI>were Judges, had by Ex|perience been found to be an intolerable Burthen to the Subject, and the Means to introduce an arbitrary Power and Government.</HI> And therefore that Court was taken away, with all the other Courts in that Statute mentioned, having like Juri&s;diction.</P>
<P>I don't mention this Statute, as if by the taking away the Court of Star Chamber, the Remedy for many of the Abu&s;es or Offences cen&s;ured there, was likewi&s;e taken away; no, I only intend by it to &s;hew, that the People of <HI>England</HI> &s;aw clearly the Danger of tru&s;ting their Liberties and Properties to be tried, even by the greate&s;t Men in the Kingdom, without the Judgment of a Jury of their Equals. They had felt the terrible effects of leaving it to the Judgment of the&s;e great Men to &s;ay what was <HI>&s;candalous and &s;editious fal&s;e or ironical.</HI> And if the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> thought this Power of judging was too great to be tru&s;ted with Men of the fir&s;t Rank in the Kingdom, with|out the Aid of a Jury, how &s;acred &s;oever their Characters might be, and therefore re&s;tored to the People their original Right of tryal by Juries I hope to be excu&s;ed for in&s;i&s;ting, that by the Judgment of a Parliament from whence no Appeal lies, the Jury are the proper Judges, of what is <HI>fal&s;e</HI> at lea&s;t, if not of what is <HI>&s;candalous and &s;editious.</HI> This is an Authority not to be de|nied, it is as plain as it is great, and to &s;ay, that this Act indeed did re&s;tore to

the People Tryals by Juries, which was not the Practice of the Star Cham|ber, but that did not give the Jurors any new Authority, or any Right to try Matters of Law, I &s;ay this Objection will not avail; for I mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t, that where Matter of Law is complicated with Matter of Fact, the Jury have a Right to determine both. As for In&s;tance; upon Indictment for Murder, the Jury may, and almo&s;t con&s;tantly do, take upon them to judge whether the Evidence will amount to Murder or Man&s;laughter, and find accordingly; and I mu&s;t &s;ay I cannot &s;ee, why in our Ca&s;e the Jury have not at lea&s;t as good a Right to &s;ay, whether our News Papers are a Libel or no Libel, as another Jury has to &s;ay, whether killing of a Man is Murder or Man&s;laughter. The Right of the Jury, to find &s;uch a Verdict as they in their Con&s;cience do think is agreeable to their Evidence, is &s;upported by the Authority of <HI>Bu&s;hel's</HI> Ca&s;e, in <HI>Vaghan's Reports, pag.</HI> 135. beyond any Doubt.

And in <HI>pag.</HI> 148. the Judge &s;ubjoins the Rea&s;on, why it is no Crime for a Jury to differ in Opinion from the Court, where he &s;ays, <HI>That a Man cannot &s;ee with another's Eye, nor hear by another's Ear; no more can a Man conclude or infer the Thing by anothers Under&s;tanding or Rea&s;oning.</HI> From all which (I in&s;i&s;t) it is very plain, <HI>That the Jury are by Law as Liberty (without any affront to the Judgment of the Court) to find both the Law and the Fact, in our Ca&s;e,</HI> as they did in the Ca&s;e I am &s;peaking to, which I will beg Leave ju&s;t to mention, and it was this. Mr. <HI>Penn</HI> and <HI>Mead</HI> being Quakers, and having met in a peaceable Manner, after being &s;hut out of their Meeting Hou&s;e, preached in <HI>Grace Church Street</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> to the People of their own Per&s;wa&s;ion, and for this they were indicted; and it was &s;aid, <HI>That they with other Per&s;ons, to the Number of</HI> 300. <HI>unlawfully and tumultuou&s;ly a&s;|&s;embled, to the Di&s;turbance of the Peace, &amp;c.</HI> To which they pleaded, <HI>Not Guilty.</HI> And the Petit Jury being &s;worn to try the I&s;&s;ue between the King and the Pri&s;oners, that is, whether they were Guilty, according to the Form of the Indictment? Here there was no Di&s;pute but they were a&s;&s;embled together, to the Number mentioned in the Indictment; But, <HI>Whether that Meeting together was riotou&s;ly, tumultuou&s;ly, and to the Di&s;turbance of the Peace?</HI> was the Que&s;tion. And the Court told the Jury it was, and ordered the Jury to find it &s;o; <HI>For</HI> (&s;aid the Court) <HI>the Meeting was the Matter of
<PB N="36" REF="004107_0034_1003C55D85B6CC90">
Fact, and that is confe&s;&s;ed, and we tell you it is unlawful, for it is again&s;t the Statute; and the Meeting being unlawful, it follows of Cour&s;e that it was tumul|tuous, and to the Di&s;turbance of the Peace.</HI> But the Jury did not think fit to take the Courts Word for it, for they could neither find <HI>Riot, Tumult,</HI> or any Thing tending to the <HI>Breach of the Peace</HI> committed at that Meeting; and they ac|quitted Mr. <HI>Penn</HI> and <HI>Mead.</HI> In doing of which they took upon them to judge both the <HI>Law</HI> and the <HI>Fact,</HI> at which the Court (being them&s;elves true Courtiers) were &s;o much offended, that they fined the Jury 40 Marks a piece, and committed them till paid. But Mr. <HI>Bu&s;hel,</HI> who valued the Right of a Juryman and the Liberty of his Country more than his own, refu&s;ed to pay the Fine, and was re&s;olved (tho' at a great Expence and trouble too) to bring, and did bring, his <HI>Habeas Corpus,</HI> to be relieved from his Fine and Impri&s;on|ment, and he was relea&s;ed accordingly; and this being the Judgment in his Ca&s;e, it is e&s;tabli&s;hed for Law, <HI>That the Judges, how great &s;oever they be, have no Right to fine impri&s;on or puni&s;h a Jury, for not finding a Verdict according to the Direction of the Court.</HI> And this I hope is &s;ufficient to prove, That Jurymen are to &s;ee with their own Eyes, to hear with their own Ears, and to make u&s;e of their own Con&s;ciences and Under&s;tandings, in judging of the Lives, Liberties or E&s;tates of their fellow Subjects. And &s;o I have done with this Point.</P>
<P>This is the &s;econd Information for Libelling of a Governour that I have known in <HI>America.</HI> And the fir&s;t, tho' it may look like a Romance, yet as it is true, I will beg Leave to mention it. Governour <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> who happened to be offended with one his Clergy, met him one Day upon the Road, and as was u&s;ual with him (under the Protection of his Commi&s;&s;ion) u&s;ed the poor Par&s;on with the wor&s;t of Language, threatned to cut off his Ears, &s;lit his No&s;e, and at la&s;t to &s;hoot him through the Head. The Par&s;on being a re|verend Man, continued all this Time uncovered in the Heat of the Sun, un|til he found an Opportunity to fly for it; and coming to a Neighbours Hou&s;e felt him&s;elf very ill of a Feaver, and immediately writes for a Doctor; and that his Phy&s;ician might the better judge of his Di&s;temper, he acquainted him with the U&s;age he had received; concluding, that the Governour was certain|ly mad, for that no Man in his Sen&s;es would have behaved in that man|ner. The Doctor unhappily &s;hews the Par&s;ons Letter; the Governour came to hear of it; and &s;o an Information was prefered again&s;t the poor Man for &s;aying <HI>he believed the Governour was mad</HI>; and it was laid in the Information to be <HI>fal&s;e, &s;candalous</HI> and <HI>wicked, and wrote with Intent to move Sedition among the People, and bring His Excellency into Contempt.</HI> But by an Order from the late Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> there was a Stop put to that Pro&s;ecution, with &s;undry others &s;et on foot by the &s;ame Governour, again&s;t Gentlemen of the greate&s;t Worth and Honour in that Government.</P>
<P>And may not I be allowed, after all this, to &s;ay, That by a little Coun|tenance, almo&s;t any Thing which a Man writes, may, with the Help of that u&s;eful Term of Art, called an <HI>Innuendo,</HI> be con&s;trued to be a Libel, according to Mr. Attorney's Definition of it, That <HI>whether the Words are &s;poke of a Per|&s;on of a publick Character, or of a private Man, whether dead or Living, good or bad, true or fal&s;e</HI> all make Libel; for according to Mr. Attorney, <HI>after a Man hears a Writing read, or reads and repeats it, or laughs at it, they are all puni&s;hable.</HI> It is true, Mr. Attorney is &s;o good as to allow, <HI>after the Party knows it to be a Libel,</HI> but he is not &s;o kind as to take the Man's Word for it.</P>
</SP>
<P><HI>Here were &s;everal Ca&s;es put to &s;hew, That tho' what a Man writes of a Governour was true, pro|per and nece&s;&s;ary, yet according to the forgoing Doctrine it might be con&s;trued to be a Libel: But Mr. <HI>Hamilton</HI> after the Tryal was over, being informed, That &s;ome of the Ca&s;es he had put had really happened in this Government, he declared he had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> of any &s;uch: and as he meant no per&s;onal Reflections, he was &s;orry he had mentioned them, and therefore they are omitted here.</HI></P>

<P>If a Libel is under&s;tood in the large and unlimited Sen&s;e urged by Mr. Attorney, there is &s;carce a Writing I know that may not be called a Libel, or &s;carce any Per&s;on &s;afe from being called to an Account as a Libeller: For <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> meek as he was, libelled <HI>Cain</HI>; and who is it that has not libelled the Devil? For according to Mr. Attorney, it is no Ju&s;tification to &s;ay one has a bad Name. <HI>Echard</HI> has libelled our good King <HI>William: Burnet</HI> has libelled among many others King <HI>Charles</HI> and King <HI>James</HI>; and <HI>Rapin</HI> has libelled them all. How mu&s;t a Man &s;peak or write, or what mu&s;t he hear, read, or &s;ing? Or when mu&s;t he laugh, &s;o as to be &s;ecure from be|ing taken up as a Libeller? I &s;incerely believe, that were &s;ome Per&s;ons to go thro' the Streets of <HI>New-York</HI> now-a-days, and read a Part of the Bible, if it was not known to be &s;uch, Mr. Attorney, with the Help of his <HI>Innuendo's,</HI> would ea&s;ily turn it into a Libel. As for In&s;tance, <HI>I&s;.</HI> IX. 16. <HI>The Leaders of the People cau&s;e them to err, and they that are led by them are de&s;troyed.</HI> But &s;hould Mr. Attorney go about to make this a Libel, he would read it thus; <HI>The Leaders of the People [innuendo,</HI> the Governour and Council of <HI>New-York] cau&s;e them [innuendo,</HI> the People of this Province] <HI>to err, and they</HI> [the Peo|ple of this Province meaning] <HI>that are led by them</HI> [the Governour and Coun|cil meaning] <HI>are de&s;troyed [innuendo,</HI> are deceived into the Lo&s;s of their Li|berty] which is the wor&s;t Kind of De&s;truction. Or if &s;ome Per&s;ons &s;hould publickly repeat, in a Manner not plea&s;ing to his Betters, the 10<HI>th</HI> and 11<HI>th</HI> Ver&s;es of the LVI. <HI>Chap.</HI> of the &s;ame Book, there Mr. Attorney would have a large Field to di&s;play his Skill, in the artful Application of his <HI>Innuendo's.</HI> The Words are, <HI>His Watchmen are all blind, they are ignorant, &amp;c. Yea, they are greedy Dogs, that can never have enough.</HI> But to make them a Libel, there is according to Mr. Attorney's Doctrine, no more wanting but the Aid of his Skill, in the right adapting his <HI>Innuendo's.</HI> As for In&s;tance; <HI>His Watchmen [innuendo,</HI> the Governour's Council and A&s;&s;embly] <HI>are blind, they are ignorant [innuendo,</HI> will not &s;ee the dangerous De&s;igns of His Excellency] <HI>Yea, they</HI> [the Governour and Council meaning] <HI>are greedy Dogs, which can never have enough [innuendo,</HI> enough of Riches and Power]. Such an In&s;tance as this is &s;eems only only fit to be laugh'd at; but I may appeal to Mr. Attorney him|&s;elf, whether the&s;e are not at lea&s;t equally proper to be applied to His Excel|lency and His Mini&s;ters, as &s;ome of the Inferences and <HI>Innuendo's</HI> in his Infor|mation again&s;t my Client. Then if Mr. Attorney is at Liberty to come into Court, and file an Information in the Kings Name, without Leave, who is &s;ecure, whom he is plea&s;ed to pro&s;ecute as a Libeller? And as the Crown Law is contended for in bad Times, there is no Remedy for the greate&s;t Op|pre&s;&s;ion of this Sort, even tho the Party pro&s;ecuted is acquitted with Honour. And give me Leave to &s;ay, as great Men as any in <HI>Britain,</HI> have boldly a&s;&s;ert|ed, That the Mode of Pro&s;ecuting by Information (when a Grand Jury will not find <HI>Billa vera</HI>) is a national Grievance, and greatly incon&s;i&s;tent with that Freedom, which the Subjects of <HI>England</HI> enjoy in mo&s;t other Ca&s;es. But if we are &s;o unhappy as not to be able to ward off this Stroke of Power directly, yet let us take Care not be cheated out of our Liberties, by Forms and Ap|pearances; let us always be &s;ure that the Charge in the Information is made out clearly even beyond a Doubt; for tho Matters in the Information may be called <HI>Form</HI> upon Tryal, yet they may be, and often have been found to be <HI>Matters of Sub&s;tance</HI> upon giving Judgment.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen</HI>; The Danger is great, in Proportion to the Mi&s;chief that may happen, through our too great Credulity. A proper Confidence in a Court is commendable; but as the Verdict (what ever it is) will be yours, you ought to refer no Part of your Duty to the Di&s;cretion of other Per&s;ons.
<PB N="38" REF="004107_0036_1003C561E2E4CCE0">
If you &s;hould be of Opinion, that there is no Fal&s;hood in Mr. <HI>Zenger's</HI> Papers, you will, nay (pardon me for the Expre&s;&s;ion) you ought to &s;ay &s;o; becau&s;e you don't know whether others (I mean the Court) may be of that Opinion. It is your Right to do &s;o, and there is much depending upon your Re&s;olution, as well as upon your Integrity.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s of liberty to a generous Mind, is wor&s;e than Death; and yet we know there have been tho&s;e in all Ages, who for the &s;ake of Preferment, or &s;ome imaginary Honour, have freely lent a helping Hand, to oppre&s;s, nay to de&s;troy their Country. This brings to my Mind that &s;aying of the immor|tal <HI>Brutus,</HI> when he look'd upon the Creatures of <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> who were very great Men, but by no Means good Men.
<Q>You <HI>Romans</HI> &s;aid <HI>Brutus,</HI> if yet I may call you &s;o, con&s;ider what you are doing; remember that you are a&s;&s;i&s;ting <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> to forge tho&s;e very Chains, which one Day he will make your &s;elves wear.</Q>
This is what every Man (that values Freedom) ought to con&s;ider: He &s;hould act by Judgment and not by Affection or Self-Intere&s;t; for, where tho&s;e pre|vail, No Ties of either Country or Kindred are regarded, as upon the other Hand, the Man, who loves his Country, prefers it's Liberty to all other Con|&s;iderations, well knowing that without Liberty, Life is a Mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>A famous In&s;tance of this you will find in the Hi&s;tory of another brave <HI>Roman</HI> of the &s;ame Name, I mean <HI>Lucius Junius Brutus,</HI> who&s;e &s;tory is well known and therefore I &s;hall mention no more of it, than only to &s;hew the Value he put upon the Freedom of his Country. After this great Man, with his Fellow Citizens whom he had engag'd in the Cau&s;e, had bani&s;h'd <HI>Tarquin</HI> the Proud, the la&s;t King of <HI>Rome,</HI> from a Throne which he a&s;cended by in|human Murders and po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by the mo&s;t dreadful Tyranny and Pro&s;criptions, and had by this Means, ama&s;s'd incredible Riches, even &s;ufficient to bribe to his Intere&s;t, many of the young Nobility of <HI>Rome,</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in recovering the Crown; but the Plot being di&s;cover'd, and principal Con&s;pirators were ap|prehended, among whom were two of the Sons of <HI>Junius Brutus.</HI> It was ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that &s;ome &s;hould be made Examples of, to deter others from attempting the re&s;toring of <HI>Tarquin</HI> and de&s;troying the Liberty of <HI>Rome.</HI> And to effect this it was, that <HI>Lucius Junius Brutus</HI> one of the Con&s;uls of <HI>Rome,</HI> in the Pre&s;ence of the <HI>Roman</HI> People, &s;at Judge and condemned his own Sons, as Traitors to their Country: And to give the la&s;t Proof of his exalted Virtue, and his Love of Liberty: He with a Firmne&s;s of Mind, (only becoming &s;o great a Man) caus'd their Heads to be &s;truck off in his own Pre&s;ence; and when he ob&s;erv'd that his rigid Virtue, occa&s;ion'd a &s;ort of Horror among the Peo|ple, it is ob&s;erv'd he only &s;aid.
<Q>My Fellow-Citizens, do not think that this Proceeds from any Want of natural Affection: No, The Death of the Sons of <HI>Brutus</HI> can affect <HI>Brutus</HI> only; but the Lo&s;s of Liberty will affect my Country.</Q>
Thus highly was Liberty e&s;teem'd in tho&s;e Days that a Father could &s;acrifice his Sons to &s;ave his Country, But why do I go to Heathen <HI>Rome,</HI> to bring In&s;tances of the Love of Liberty, the be&s;t Blood in <HI>Britain</HI> has been &s;hed in the Cau&s;e of Liberty; and the Freedom we enjoy at this Day, may be &s;aid to be (in a great Mea&s;ure) owing to the glorious Stand the fa|mous <HI>Hamden,</HI> and other of our Countrymen, made again&s;t the arbitrary De|mands, and illegal Impo&s;itions, of the Times in which they lived; Who rather than give up the Rights of <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> and &s;ubmit to pay an illegal Tax of no more, I think, than 3 Shillings, re&s;olv'd to undergo, and for their Li|berty of their Country did undergo the greate&s;t Extremities, in that arbitrary and terrible Court of Star Chamber, to who&s;e arbitrary Proceedings, (it being compos'd of the principal Men of the Realm, and cal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ulated to &s;upport arbi|trary Government) no Bounds or Limits could be &s;et, nor could any other Hand remove the Evil but a Parliament.</P>

If then this is the Nature of Power, let us at lea&s;t do our Duty, and like wi&s;e Men (who value Freedom) u&s;e our utmo&s;t Care to &s;upport Liberty, the only Bulwark again&s;t lawle&s;s Power, which in all Ages has &s;acrificed to it's wild Lu&s;t and boundle&s;s Am|bition, the Blood of the be&s;t Men that ever liv'd.</P>
<P>I hope to be pardon'd Sir for my Zeal upon this Occa&s;ion; it is an old and wi&s;e Caution. <HI>That when our Neighbours Hou&s;e is on Fire, we ought to take Care of our own.</HI> For tho' Ble&s;&s;ed be God, I live in a Government where Liberty is well under&s;tood, and freely enjoy'd; yet Experience has &s;hewn us all (I'm &s;ure it has to me) that a bad Precedent in one Government, is &s;oon &s;et up for an Authority in another; and therefore I cannot but think it mine, and eve|ry Hone&s;t Man's Duty, that (while we pay all due Obedience to Men in Authority) we ought at the &s;ame Time to be upon our Guard again&s;t Power, wherever we apprehend that it may affect our&s;elves or our Fellow-Subjects.</P>
<P>I am truly very unequal to &s;uch an Undertaking on many Accounts. And you &s;ee I labour under the Weight of many Years, and am born down with great Infirmities of Body; yet Old and Weak as I am, I &s;hould think it my Duty if required, to go to the utmo&s;t Part of the Land, where my Service cou'd be of any U&s;e in a&s;&s;i&s;ting to quench the Flame of Pro&s;ecutions upon Informations, &s;et on Foot by the Government, to deprive a People of the Right of Remon&s;trating, (and complaining too) of the arbitrary Attempts of Men in Power. Men who injure and oppre&s;s the People under their Admi|ni&s;tration provoke them to cry out and complain; and then make that very Complaint the Foundation for new Oppre&s;&s;ions and Pro&s;ecutions. I wi&s;h I could &s;ay there were no In&s;tances of this Kind. But to conclude; the Que&s;ti|on before the Court and you Gentlemen of the Jury, is not of &s;mall nor pri|vate Concern, it is not the Cau&s;e of a poor Printer, nor of <HI>New-York</HI> alone, which you are now trying: No!

It is the Cau&s;e of Liberty, and I make no Doubt but your upright Conduct, this Day, will not only entitle you to the Love and E|&s;teem of your Fellow-Citizens; but every Man who prefers Freedom to a Life of &s;lavery will ble&s;s and honour You, as Men who have baffled the At|tempt of Tyranny; and by an impartial and uncorrupt Verdict, have laid a noble Foundation for &s;ecuring to our&s;elves, our Po&s;terity, and our Neighbours, That, to which Nature and the Laws of our Country have given us a Right, &mdash; The Liberty&mdash; both of expo&s;ing and oppo&s;ing arbitrary Power (in the&s;e Parts of the World, at lea&s;t) by &s;peaking and writing Truth.</P>

<P><HI>Here Mr. Attorney ob&s;erv'd, that Mr. <HI>Hamilton</HI> had gone very much out of the Way, and had made him&s;elf and the People very merry: But that he had been citing Ca&s;es, not at all to the Purpo&s;e; he &s;aid, there was no &s;uch Cau&s;e as Mr. <HI>Bu&s;hel</HI>'s or Sir <HI>Edward Hales</HI> before the Court; and he could not find out what the Court or Jury had to do with Di&s;pen&s;ations, Riots or unlaw|ful A&s;&s;emblies: All that the Jury had to con&s;ider of was Mrs. <HI>Zenger</HI>'s Prin|ting and Publi&s;hing two &s;candalous Libels, which very highly reflected on his Excellency and the principal Men concern'd in the Admini&s;tration of this Government, which is confe&s;s'd.

I &s;hall there|fore only ob&s;erve to you that, as the Facts or Words in the Information are confe&s;&s;ed: The only Thing that can come in Que&s;tion before you is, whether the Words as &s;et forth in the Information make a Lybel. And that is a Matter of Law, no Doubt, and which you may leave to the Court. But I &s;hall trouble you no further with any Thing more of my own, but read to you the Words of a learned and upright Judge <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ch. J. <HI>Holt</HI> in <HI>Tutchin</HI>'s Ca&s;e</NOTE> in a Ca&s;e of the like Nature.</P>
<Q><P>To &s;ay that corrupt Officers are appointed to admini&s;ter Affairs, is certainly a Reflection on the Government. If People &s;hould not be called to account for po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing the People with an ill Opinion of the Government, no Government can &s;ub|&s;i&s;t, For it is very nece&s;&s;ary for all Governments that the People &s;hould have a good Opinion of it. And nothing can be wor&s;e to any Government, than to en|deavour to procure Animo&s;ities; as to the Management of it, this has been al|ways look'd upon as a Crime, and no Government can be &s;afe without it be pu|ni&s;hed.</P>
<P>Now you are to con&s;ider, whether the&s;e Words I have read to you, do not tend to beget an ill Opinion of the Admini&s;tration of the Government? To tell us, that tho&s;e that are employed know nothing of the Matter, and tho&s;e that do know are not employed. Men are not adapted to Offices, but Offices, to Men out of a par|ticular Regard to their Intere&s;t, and not to their Fitne&s;s for the Places; this is the Purport of the&s;e Papers.</P></Q>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Hamilton</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I humbly beg Your Honours Pardon: I am very much mis|apprehended, if you &s;uppo&s;e what I &s;aid was &s;o de&s;igned.</P>
<P>Sir, you know; I made an Apology for the Freedom I found my &s;elf under a Nece&s;&s;ity of u&s;ing upon this Occa&s;ion. I &s;aid, there was Nothing per&s;onal de&s;igned; it aro&s;e from the Nature of our Defence.</P>
</SP>
<P>The Jury withdrew and in a &s;mall Time returned and being a&s;ked by the Clerk whether they were agreed of their Verdict, and whether <HI>John Peter Zenger</HI> was guilty of Printing and Publi&s;hing the Libels in the Information mentioned? They an&s;wered by <HI>Thomas Hunt,</HI> their Foreman, <HI>Not Guilty,</HI> Upon which there were three Huzzas in the Hall which was crowded with People and the next Day I was di&s;charged from my Impri&s;onment.</P>
