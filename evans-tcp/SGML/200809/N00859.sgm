<P>IN this Chapter, and that which follows, we have an account given of the mo&s;t remarkable pa&s;&s;ages of the Life and Reign of <HI>Jo&s;iah,</HI> an Excellent Prince, and in &s;ome re&s;pects, unparallel'd by any of the Kings that had gone before him. I &s;hall not now in&s;i&s;t on his early piety, and &s;pee|dily exerting it in an indu&s;trious re&s;toring
<PB N="4" REF="001035_0003_0FAEEA146A7821A0">
of the Wor&s;hip of God, which had been &s;o depraved under &s;ome of his Progenitours. That which I &s;hall ob&s;erve, to make way to the <HI>Text</HI> under con&s;ideration, is that whiles he is engaged about purging of the Temple, God ordered the finding, and pre&s;enting him with the Book of the Law, which was of manifold u&s;e to him at this time, <HI>ver&s;e</HI> 8 <HI>&amp;c. When Gods Servants are &s;incerely engaged in Reformation he is wont to reveal him&s;elf more unto them, for their direction and quickning.</HI> One eminent and ob&s;ervable pa&s;&s;age is, that upon the reading of this book to him, <HI>Jo&s;i|ah is</HI> convinced that his people lay expo&s;ed to the fierce anger of God, in that by their Apo&s;ta&s;y they had laid them&s;elves open to the threatnings therein denounced; which deeply affects him, <HI>Ver&s;e</HI> 11. <HI>He rent his clothes.</HI> Whereupon he pre&s;ently &s;ends me&s;&s;engers to enquire of God what was to be done to di|vert the Judgment denounced, <HI>Ver&s;e</HI> 12, 13, 14. From thence to the end of the <HI>Chapter,</HI> we have an account of the return given him upon this me&s;&s;age. <HI>It is the &s;urest way, for Gods people to ask coun&s;el of him, when they are in any perplexity.</HI> In this return there are two parts ob&s;ervable,</P>
<P N="1">1. A confirmation of the threatnings a|gain&s;t the body of that People, which &s;hould certainly i&s;&s;ue in their ruine, <HI>Ver&s;e</HI> 15, 16, 17.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="5" REF="001035_0004_0FAEEA14C6706448">2. A con&s;olation directed to <HI>Jo&s;iah, Ver&s;e</HI> 18. <HI>to the end of the Chapter.</HI> Many worthy remarks might be made on every pa&s;&s;age of it, but I may not tarry here: I &s;hall only glance on the la&s;t <HI>Article</HI> of it, recorded in our <HI>Text,</HI> which contains in it a gracious pro|mi&s;e made to him with regard to tho&s;e times which were coming. The Promi&s;e in Sum is, that God would keep off this Calamity, during his life, and would deliver him from the &s;ight and &s;orrow of it, by removing him out of this World. In particular, there are three pa&s;&s;ages by which it is expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>I will gather thee to thy fathers.</HI>] Which manner of &s;peech is u&s;ed in the Scriptures to &s;et forth the &s;tate of the Dead, in which one Generation &s;ucceeds another; and it is indif|ferently applyed both to Godly and wicked men: and divers &s;uppo&s;e it to refer not only to the &s;tate of the Body, but of the Soul too, after Death; but I di&s;pute it not: only ob|&s;erve, That God &s;aith he will do it, <HI>I will gather thee</HI>; which tells us, <HI>That God di&s;po&s;eth of the Life and Death of all men at his plea&s;ure.</HI> And becau&s;e God promi&s;eth this to him as a favour or priviledge, it farther teacheth, <HI>That it is &s;ometimes a peculiar Priviledge for Godly men to Dy.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>And thou &s;halt be gathered to thy Grave in Peace.</HI>] To be gathered to his Grave, intends,
<PB N="6" REF="001035_0005_0FAEEA17F073A020">
that he &s;hould have a funeral be&s;towed on him; and he had a very honourable one, as is recorded in, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 35.24, 25. But it maybe here demurred, how this promi&s;e was fulfill|ed, that he &s;hould be gathered in Peace, where|as he was &s;lain in battel? Some interpret it, that he dyed in Peace with God, and &s;o en|tred into everla&s;ting Peace, which is true and not hence to be excluded, yet it is not the whole truth of it. Others therefore generally under&s;tand it of the publick Peace of the Nation, which was not at that time embroiled in War; and both of the&s;e may be taken in conjunction: and we may learn from it, <HI>That let a man dy a natural or violent Death, yet if he be reconciled to God, he dies in Peace.</HI> As al&s;o, <HI>That it is a favour to live and dy in times of publick Tranquility. Hezekiah</HI> thought it to be &s;o, 2 <HI>King</HI> 20.19 <HI>Is it not good, if peace and truth be in my days</HI>?</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>And thine eyes &s;hall not &s;ee all the evil which I will bring upon this place.</HI>] The&s;e words are &s;uppo&s;ed to be explicatory of the former, and added to &s;ignify in what re&s;pect he &s;hould be gathered in Peace, <HI>viz.</HI> That he &s;hould not be di&s;turbed with the fight of the Calamities of that di&s;mal time; but that by Death he &s;hould be out of the noi&s;e of it, or any acquaintance with it: teaching us, <HI>That Dead Saints, when gone to their re&s;t, know
<PB N="7" REF="001035_0006_0FAEEA196CBF3B10">
nothing of the affairs of this World.</HI> And con|&s;equently, <HI>That it is a kindne&s;s for them to be called off fir&s;t, when doleful Calamities are coming upon their People.</HI> But we may farther look upon the&s;e words as they &s;tand di&s;tributive with the foregoing threatning again&s;t the People; and it is, <HI>q d.</HI> I will without fail bring all the&s;e evils upon the &s;inful Land; however I will defer it as long as thou live&s;t, and &s;tande&s;t in the gap: I will therefore fir&s;t &s;ee thee well hou&s;ed, and then I will open the floodgates and let in Cataracts of de&s;olation upon them; whence ob&s;erve this,</P>
<P><HI>DOCTRINE.</HI> Sometimes God takes away good men in order to the letting in of more fearful and amazing Judgments upon a People.</P>
<P>There are &s;ea&s;ons when the removal of &s;uch as the&s;e is a progno&s;tick of great Evils at the door, and ready to break in upon the Land where they have lived. It is not in|deed always &s;o, but &s;ometimes it is other|wi&s;e: and there are the <HI>Rules</HI> for di&s;cerning of this, which it becames all wi&s;e men to ob|&s;erve, that they may practice accordingly; for we are told, <HI>Prov.</HI> 27.12. <HI>The prudent fore&s;eeth the evil, and hideth him&s;elf.</HI> It may
<PB N="8" REF="001035_0007_0FAEEA1A1CC36358">
then be &s;uitable and &s;ea&s;onable in &s;uch a day as this is, to make &s;ome enquiry into that <HI>Ca&s;e, viz.</HI></P>
<P>Que&s;t. <HI>When the removal of good men is a foreboding &s;ymptom of great mi&s;eries ready to break in upon a people.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A</HI> That this Ca&s;e may be rightly &s;tated &amp; re&s;olved, let the&s;e <HI>Conclu&s;ions</HI> be ob&s;erved.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That Death is the common lot of all, both good and bad.</HI> There is an old Statute for it, which hath been of force ever &s;ince mans fall, <HI>Heb.</HI> 9.27. <HI>It is appointed for men once to dy.</HI> It was &s;in that brought it into the world, and &s;ubjected all &s;inful men to it, <HI>Rom</HI> 5, 12. <HI>Death pa&s;&s;ed on all men, for that all have &s;in|ned.</HI> It therefore belongs to the Cur&s;e, and though God hath taken out the &s;ting of the Cur&s;e from it in re&s;pect of his own Children, and rendred it beneficial to them, yet he hath &s;een good to continue it in this world, and make it to be the pa&s;&s;age of men from time to eternity; and hence it is not, of it &s;elf, a note of di&s;tinction between the Godly and the wicked, for both dy, and tho&s;e pa&s;s over to heaven, as well as the&s;e are detruded into hell, through this common road: It is the P&s;almi&s;ts ob&s;ervation, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 49.10. <HI>He &s;ees that wi&s;e men dy, likewi&s;e the fooli&s;h and bruiti&s;h
<PB N="9" REF="001035_0008_0FAEEA1A90AF8F88">
per&s;on</HI>; and this <HI>Job</HI> lotted upon, <HI>Chap</HI> 30 23. <HI>I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the hou&s;e appointed for all living.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That Death, whenever it comes, is to good men, a pa&s;port from their labour to their reward.</HI> The time of life is working time, and tho' Godly men can merit nothing by their be&s;t works, nay they utterly renounce all thoughts of &s;o doing, yet God hath, in the New Co|venant, promi&s;ed a reward of Grace, to the faithful Service that is done him by his Chil|dren in this life, for we are told in, <HI>P&s;al</HI> 58.11. <HI>Verily there is a reward for the righteous.</HI> And as they are to follow their work as long, as they continue here, being faithful in it unto death, &s;o there is a recompence which they &s;hall receive in the end of it, after they have per&s;evered in it, Gal 6.9. <HI>Let us not be weary in well doing, for in due &s;ea&s;on we &s;hall reap if we faint not.</HI> And the Scriptures a|bound with promi&s;es of this nature. Now though there is re&s;erved a more glorious compleatment of this reward for the great day; in which their faithful Service &s;hall be declared openly before the whole world, and they &s;hall receive it both in Soul and Body after the mo&s;t &s;tately manner, yet their Souls do enter upon it immediately at their di&s;&s;olution. We are therefore told, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 57.2. <HI>They &s;hall enter into peace, they &s;hall
<PB N="10" REF="001035_0009_0FAEEA1B5BF800F0">
re&s;t in their beds, each one walking in his up|rightne&s;s</HI>; they are on this account declared ble&s;&s;ed from that very in&s;tant, <HI>Rev.</HI> 14.13. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are the dead, which die in the Lord, from henceforth:</HI> And this is contained in the rea|&s;on which <HI>Paul</HI> gives of his de&s;ire; <HI>Phil.</HI> 1.23. <HI>Having a de&s;ire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>That God hath allotted to each one of his Servants, the work of their Generation, and when it is done he calls them to re&s;t.</HI> Every Godly man is cordially engaged in the Ser|vice of God, and it is his Duty diligently to pur&s;ue it as long as he abides in the Body, for he will have work to do all the while he liveth: but God hath in his holy coun&s;el laid out what work he will have from eve|ry one, which he will give them the oppor|tunity for, and when they have done that, he calls them off and gives them a <HI>quietus &s;it.</HI> He knows what bu&s;ine&s;s he hath laid out for this and for that man to do, and as he will continue him in life until that be o|ver, &s;o he will call him home to him&s;elf when it is done; thus we read of <HI>David, Acts</HI> 13 36. <HI>David after he had &s;erved his own generation by the will of God, fell on &s;leep, and was laid unto his fathers, and &s;aw corrupti+on.</HI> They may po&s;&s;ibly &s;ee a great deal more of de&s;irable work before them, which
<PB N="11" REF="001035_0010_0FAEEA1C15D42E38">
they would have been glad if they might be &s;erviceable in; but God accepts of their fi|delity in that little which they have done faithfully, and thereupon giveth them an honourable di&s;charge, in calling them home to re&s;t in his Glory.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>That when God hath more favour to be|&s;tow on his people, he adapts other in&s;truments to be made u&s;e of in the continuing of it.</HI> He doth not always take away good men in an|ger again&s;t a people, but he doth it to de|clare his &s;overaignty and his power, and ab|&s;olute independency, and to take the occa&s;i|on to di&s;tribute his honours among his Ser|vants. As he u&s;eth none to do his work, for any need that he hath of them, for he could as ea&s;ily have done it without them; &s;o he hath the re&s;idue of the Spirit, and can com|municate to others a double portion of it as he plea&s;eth, when he &s;ees meet to call them to any eminent &s;ervice; and he makes way for their &s;erviceablene&s;s by calling of others from their po&s;t, when they have kept it as long as he &s;aw good: and when he purpo|&s;eth the continuance of his benignity to a people, he is wont thus to do Thus when <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was to dy, God provided and &s;pirited <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> to conduct his people <HI>I&s;rael</HI> into, and give them the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Canaan,</HI> whom the other had &s;o happily conducted to the
<PB N="12" REF="001035_0011_0FAEEA1F9B82A5F8">
borders of it. <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> therefore when he was acquainted that he mu&s;t not do that &s;ervice him&s;elf, &s;o addre&s;&s;eth God about it, <HI>Numb.</HI> 27.16. <HI>Let the Lord, the God of the &s;pirits of all fle&s;h, &s;et a man over the Congregation, &amp;c.</HI> Which the Lord accordingly did, and com|mands <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> to &s;et apart <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> for it, <HI>ver&s;e</HI> 18, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And by this way God mercifully continues his pre&s;ence with and among a people. Thus when <HI>David</HI> had accompli&s;h|ed his work in making ready for the Buil|ding the Temple, <HI>Solomon</HI> &s;ucceeds him, who carries on the work that his father had begun, with very great &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>That God &s;ometimes takes away u&s;eful in|&s;truments in the mid&s;t of their work, in Te&s;ti|mony of his di&s;plea&s;ure at them per&s;onally.</HI> The mo&s;t pious and eminently &s;erviceable men have their frailties &amp; &s;inful infirmities; and though in the tenour of their lives they do faithfully &s;erve their generation to Gods glory, in obedience to his command, yet he is &s;ometimes plea&s;ed &s;o far to leave them to them&s;elves, as once he did <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> as that in &s;ome overt action or other, they di&s;cover this imperfection, by doing &s;omething that is to Gods di&s;honour, and by which he i&s; righteou&s;ly provoked at them: and though he loves their per&s;ons, yet he di&s;likes the things that are &s;o done by them, as, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="001035_0012_0FAEEA210EF0D058">
11 <HI>ult. The thing that David did, di&s;plea&s;ed the Lord.</HI> And though he accepts of their faith|ful Service, and will reward it graciou&s;ly; nor &s;hall the&s;e obliquities put them out of his favour; yet he will bear &s;ome notable Te&s;timony again&s;t the thing which they did, and that in this world; and he hath many ways in which he doth this, in&s;tances where|of we &s;hall find in the Word of God: and among others this is one, that he call them off in the mid&s;t of a work, which their hearts were engaged in, and will not &s;uffer them to accompli&s;h it: which, though it doth not hinder their eternal ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, yet is a fatherly rebuke given them, and is to them a matter of humbling, and to others a matter of warning. Thus <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> conducts <HI>I&s;rael</HI> through the Wilderne&s;s to the very bor|ders of the promi&s;ed Land, and they were now ju&s;t ready to enter in and po&s;&s;e&s;s it, but he mu&s;t dy, though apt enough for that Ser|vice, for we read, <HI>Deut.</HI> 34 7. <HI>His eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated</HI>; but the rea|&s;on why it mu&s;t be &s;o is rendred in, <HI>Numb.</HI> 27.14 <HI>Thou &s;halt be gathered to thy people, as Aaron thy brother was gathered; for ye rebelled again&s;t my Commandment (in the de&s;art of Zin, in the &s;trife of the Congregation) to &s;anctifie me at the water, before their eyes.</HI> Nor could he obtain a repeal of this &s;entence, though he
<PB N="14" REF="001035_0013_0FAEEA2240C795C0">
earne&s;tly reque&s;ted it, <HI>Deut</HI> 3 23. <HI>&amp;c. I be|&s;ought the Lord at that time, &s;aying, &amp;c. I pray thee let me go over, &amp;c. but the Lord was wroth and &s;aid, let it &s;uffice thee, &s;peak no more to me of this matter.</HI> Thus al&s;o it was with <HI>Jo&s;iah,</HI> who had wrought a great reformation in the Kingdom of <HI>Judah,</HI> and now hoped to live to confirm it, and enjoy many happy days in the comfort of it, but he mu&s;t dy, and that bu&s;ine&s;s cea&s;e: and we are told how this came to pa&s;s, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 35.22 <HI>He heark|ened not to the words of Necho from the mouth of God</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Neverthele&s;s there are times wherein God takes away &s;uch men in a way of Judgment a|gain&s;t their people.</HI> Nay, this may be &s;o, and often is &s;o, when they them&s;elves do &s;uffer the cha&s;ti&s;ement of their own failings: for God many times leaves them to &s;uch mi|&s;takes, in anger again&s;t a people; thus we read, 2 <HI>Sam</HI> 24 1 <HI>The anger of the Lord was kindled again&s;t I&s;rael and he moved David a|gain&s;t them, to &s;ay, go number I&s;rael and Judah.</HI> And &s;uch to be &s;ure was the removal of <HI>Jo&s;i|ah</HI> at this time, for, in regard of him&s;elf, it was an accompli&s;hment of the gracious pro|mi&s;e made to him in our <HI>Text</HI>; and God of|ten calls off &s;uch of his precious Servants when there is no &s;uch thing; and &s;uch a Pro|vidence is recorded in the Scriptures as an in|troduction
<PB N="15" REF="001035_0014_0FAEEA22DCC00410">
to other and greater calamities for which it is to make way, and which are to en&s;ue upon it: read for this, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 3 <HI>beg. The Lord of Ho&s;ts doth take away from Judah and from Jeru&s;alem, the mighty men, the Man of War, the Judge, the Prophet, the Prudent, the Ancient, the Coun&s;ellour, &amp;c.</HI> So that it is not only a Judgment it &s;elf, but an harbinger to more and more awful Judgments. And that we be not mi&s;taken in our ob&s;ervation on &s;uch a di&s;pen&s;ation, let us con&s;ider:</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That every Godly man is a ble&s;&s;ing in the place where be lives, and his Death is a lo&s;s.</HI> It is the wi&s;e mans ob&s;ervation, <HI>Prov.</HI> 12 26. <HI>The righteous is more excellent than his neighbour.</HI> And the more worth there is in any thing, the greater damage is &s;u&s;teined in the lo&s;ing of it.

Heaven, and God neareth their prayers, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 66 2. <HI>To this man will I look, even to him that is poor, and of a contrite &s;pirit, and trembleth at my word.</HI> And therefore, let the&s;e be never &s;o ob&s;cure, carry never &s;o mean a part among men, be little noticed, but rather de&s;pi&s;ed by their Neighbours, yet when they dy, the places they lived in are &s;ufferers by it; on which account we find the P&s;almi&s;t &s;o ex|po&s;tulating; <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 12.1. <HI>Help, Lord, for the Godly man cea&s;eth, for the faithful fail from a|mong the Children of men.</HI></P>

their zeal, their holy Conver&s;ation, and the Te&s;timonies which they have born again&s;t &s;in, have been burden&s;ome to the mo&s;t, and they have &s;at unea&s;y under them. Hereupon they have on all occa&s;ions, and without ju&s;t occa&s;ion, murmured, and complained, and found fault with them: in &s;tead of giving God thanks for &s;uch men, they have wi&s;hed them gone, thought they lived too long, counted them the <HI>troublers of I&s;rael,</HI> been ready to charge all adver&s;e Providences which have fallen out among them, to their evil conduct; and have &s;ought all under hand ways to un|der-mine their names, and bla&s;t their credit among men.

This was evident in the Death of that holy Reformer, <HI>Jehojadah.</HI> We indeed read of great outward re&s;pect &s;hewn him in his funeral, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 24.16. <HI>They buried him in the City of David, among the Kings, becau&s;e he had done good in I&s;rael, both towards God, &amp; towards his hou&s;e.</HI> But we &s;hall di&s;cover their Hypocri&s;y in what they did pre&s;ently upon it, <HI>Ver&s;e</HI> 17. <HI>After the death of Jehojadah, came the Princes of Judah, and made obei&s;ance to the King, and he hearkened to them.</HI> No doubt they acco&s;ted him after &s;uch a manner as this, That great zealot is now Dead, who held us under &s;uch an intolerable re&s;traint, and abridged us of our liberty, and would not &s;uffer us to follow our own inclinations, but puni&s;hed every tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but now he is gone, and will trouble us no more, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It is therefore given as an <HI>Omen</HI> of evil ha&s;tening, when &s;uch men dy, and their Death is not duly re&s;ented, <HI>I&s;a</HI> 57.1. <HI>The righteous peri&s;heth, and no man lays it to heart, and merciful men are taken away, none con&s;ider|ing that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come.</HI> And truly this makes it evident that they were a burden to their people

the mid&s;t of us; God hath many ways te&s;tified a|gain&s;t us, &amp; waited for our Reformation, but we have rather grown wor&s;e, &amp; remain &s;tupid; &amp; <HI>his hand is &s;tretched out still</HI>; &amp; what &s;hall we conject|ure is like to be the end of the&s;e things? let me on|ly here in&s;inuate, the con&s;ideration of the juncture of time, which mu&s;t needs put a great <HI>Empha&s;is</HI> on the Providence it &s;elf, How much our affairs at home are involved, is be&s;t known to &s;uch as &s;it at our Helm: but this all are privy to, that it is a time threatning to involve all <HI>Chri&s;tendom</HI> in War; a time wherein God hath but lately removed from us a <HI>Governour,</HI> under who&s;e mild conduct we enjoyed many de&s;irable things; and our hopes under God, upon his departure, were on him who&s;e lo&s;s we now bewail: &amp; by this there is a wide gap made in our hedge; &amp; who &s;hall thru&s;t into, &amp; make it up? It then deeply concerns us all to <HI>lay the&s;e things to heart,</HI> &amp; tremble before this holy &amp; angry God Our only hope is, that when all created help fails us, &amp; <HI>there is none &s;hut up or left,</HI> God knows how to appear for our help &amp; &s;uccour; only let it rouz us up to a due &s;en&s;e of his anger, and let that drive us to a &s;peedy &amp; cordial returning, to him: &amp; let it encourage us thus to do, becau&s;e <HI>God is gracious,</HI> &amp; if <HI>we repent</HI> of our &s;ins, <HI>he will repent of the evil</HI> which he threatens us withal. And let us not &s;light or de&s;pi&s;e the&s;e &s;o|lemn warnings given us by our God, le&s;t he be pro|voked to anger, <HI>and cau&s;e the Funerals of our wi&s;e and good Leaders, to be but the harbingers to the Fune|ral of all, that is preoious &amp; plea&s;ant among us.</HI></P>
