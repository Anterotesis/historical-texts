<P>_THESE Words are placed at the Conclu&s;ion of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour's Sermon on the Mount; and contain the Judgment or Opinion of his Hearers, in Re|lation to his Doctrine.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="005554_0004_1018669B8B187FF8">As he was the Founder of our holy Re|ligion, it cannot be di&s;puted, but that he be&s;t knew, what Doctrines were fitte&s;t to be taught; and what was the be&s;t Method of propagating them. &mdash;In &s;hort, he be&s;t knew what was the mo&s;t u&s;eful, the mo&s;t in&s;tructive and edifying Way of Preaching. And as our Text gives the highe&s;t Character of this Sermon; when it affirms, that <HI>they all (i. e.</HI> his Hearers) <HI>were a&s;toni&s;h'd at his Doc|trine</HI>; and that he taught &s;o as never Man did before him. I purpo&s;e to take Occa&s;ion from it, of examining what is the be&s;t and mo&s;t proper Way of teaching and in&s;tructing Men in the Knowledge of the Go&s;pel.&mdash; In &s;hort, I de&s;ign to examine what is and ought to be accounted the be&s;t and mo&s;t edifying Way of Preaching.</P>
<P>And the Nece&s;&s;ity of a Di&s;cour&s;e upon this Subject, is very manife&s;t; for be&s;ides the
<PB N="5" REF="005554_0005_1018669D4AF6B3A0">
many Terms of Reproach and Di&s;parage|ment that are ca&s;t upon our Preaching, by tho&s;e who&s;e Intere&s;t it is to draw away Hearers; amu&s;ing them with artful Terms of much-&s;eeming Sound, but no real Significance: Such as <HI>legal Preaching, carnal In&s;truction, preaching Morality,</HI> and the like.&mdash;I &s;ay, be&s;ides this Evil, it is a &s;ad and melancholy Truth, that among tho&s;e who are &s;teady Attendants upon the divine Wor&s;hip, we do not always find that Increa&s;e of Piety and Godline&s;s, that reli&s;h of a divine Life; that holy and exemplary Behaviour, which one would think the&s;e Means of Grace are fitted to produce.</P>
<P>And becau&s;e Men are willing the Fault &s;hould re&s;t any where, rather than with them&s;elves; &s;ome are ready to attribute their Unfruitfulne&s;s to their Teachers.&mdash;The Ser|mons they hear, are not moving and affec|tionate; they don't rai&s;e in them tho&s;e earne&s;t De&s;ires and Longings after Chri&s;t, which they want to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of. They hear in|deed, a great deal of &s;mooth Rea&s;oning, many Per&s;ua&s;ives to Duty, and many earne&s;t Di&s;|&s;ua&s;ives from Vice; they have Rules laid down for the Conduct of their Lives, and tho&s;e earne&s;tly enough recommended. But
<PB N="6" REF="005554_0006_1018669F3787D9D0">
there is &s;omething they fancy &s;till wanting, they don't well know what it is; but they &s;uppo&s;e they &s;hould hear more of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and of <HI>Faith,</HI> of <HI>his Righteou&s;ne&s;s being imputed to us for Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI>; that is, in plain Terms, they want to be a&s;&s;ured that Chri&s;t has &s;o done every Thing for them, as to have left nothing for them to do.&mdash;Thus al&s;o, the <HI>Terrors of the Law</HI> are much neglected, tho' nece&s;&s;ary to the Awakening and Conviction of Sinners.&amp;Something or other of this Kind they imagine, and are told would be more <HI>affecting,</HI> would &s;tir them up more, and have a better Influence upon them.</P>
<P>This therefore de&s;erves to be enquired into, Whether informing the Minds or Un|der&s;tanding of the Hearers, in the great Truths and Duties of the Go&s;pel; and endeavouring to convince their Judgments of the Importance of the&s;e Duties, and of the Nece&s;&s;ity of re|ceiving and practicing them; and of their avoiding every Thing that is incon&s;i&s;tent or contrary to them? be not the mo&s;t edifying Way of Preaching?.&mdash;I &s;hall endeavour in &s;hort, to prove, that this is the only Go&s;pel Preaching; and that to talk of any other Way or Method (unle&s;s al&s;o they pretend to
<PB N="7" REF="005554_0007_101866A31469FF78">
In&s;piration) is highly wicked, and tends only to amu&s;e People with a Set of ob&s;cure and difficult Terms and Phra&s;es, without meaning.</P>
<P>And that we may not be mi&s;led in an Enquiry of &s;o much Importance, it is proper that we throw a&s;ide all human Opinions con|cerning the Matter; and have Recour&s;e im|mediately to the Fountain Head, the Standard of Truth and Error; I mean the Holy Scrip|tures.&mdash;And as no human Authority ought to have any Weight in this Argument; &s;o I &s;hall object again&s;t any pretended <HI>Experiences</HI> that this or that Way of Preaching is more or le&s;s Edifying: For the&s;e Things may mi&s;lead or deceive us; becau&s;e it would be &s;etting up one Man's <HI>Experience</HI> in Oppo&s;ition to another's.</P>
<P>The only Thing that ought to have Weight with us, is the Scripture. And becau&s;e there is not any where an expre&s;s Precept about preaching, &s;tating and defining what we are obliged to under&s;tand by it; we are left to collect the true Notion of it, from the Ex|amples; fir&s;t of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour and then from the Sermons of his Apo&s;tles; and parti|cularly from the Di&s;cour&s;es of that mo&s;t elo|quent and ju&s;tly admired Preacher, St. <HI>Paul.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><PB N="8" REF="005554_0008_101866A95A750688">I. And Fir&s;t, let us con&s;ider the Example of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour's Preaching, as it is exhibited to us in this Sermon; of which mention is made in my Text. For tho' he taught upon many other Occa&s;ions both in publick and private; yet we have no com|pleat publick Sermon of his, be&s;ides this which is here recorded.</P>
<P>And the fir&s;t Thing remarkable in this Sermon, is, that it is adapted to his Hearers, <HI>(i. e.)</HI> his Di&s;ciples. For tho' there was a mixt Multitude, that now heard him; yet his Di&s;cour&s;e was chiefly directed to his Di&s;|ciples. This we learn from the 5th Chap. 1.2. <HI>And &s;eeing the Multitudes, he went up into a Mountain; and when he was &s;et, his Di&s;ciples came unto him; and he opened his Mouth, and taught them, &s;aying, ble&s;&s;ed are the Poor in Spirit,</HI> &amp;c.&mdash;Now his Di&s;ciples having already received him as their Ma&s;ter; having already li&s;ted them&s;elves his Followers; he gives them &s;uch divine Directions as might go|vern their Lives, and make it evident that they did not receive his Religion in vain. Accord|ingly this whole Sermon is made up of the mo&s;t admirable Precepts for the Conduct of Life.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="005554_0009_101866ACC0967F58">The fir&s;t Thing that he recommends to them, is <HI>Poverty of Spirit,</HI> or a meek and humble Di&s;po&s;ition of Mind; next he ad|vi&s;es to <HI>Patience under Afflictions</HI>; then &s;ets forth the <HI>Reward of Meekne&s;s</HI>; after this, he per&s;uades them to <HI>&s;eek earne&s;tly after Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s</HI>; then to acquire a <HI>merciful Di&s;po&s;i|tion.</HI> And as hitherto he had recommended Purity of Life, he next in&s;i&s;ts upon Purity of Heart likewi&s;e; and the promoting <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Love</HI> among one another. And as he had before exhorted to Patience under the Afflic|tions which God &s;ees fit to exerci&s;e Men withal; &s;o now he points out the &s;ame Re|medy for &s;u&s;taining the Injuries they receive from one another.&mdash;From hence he proceeds to recommend a <HI>circum&s;pect Behaviour</HI>; and then in&s;i&s;ts upon their ob&s;erving the <HI>Com|mandments</HI>: But becau&s;e the Phari&s;ees had by their Traditions, explained away the &s;pi|ritual Meaning and Intention of them, he makes a mo&s;t exact and noble Expo&s;ition of the Law; and then clo&s;es up this Part of his Di&s;cour&s;e with an Exhortation to <HI>Per|fection.</HI>&mdash;And the whole Sum of his Di&s;cour&s;e in the two next Chapters, is nothing el&s;e but an Exhortation to the Practice of &s;everal
<PB N="10" REF="005554_0010_101866AE600F17A0">
moral Duties; &s;uch as <HI>Alms,</HI> and <HI>Prayer</HI> and <HI>Fa&s;ting, forgivene&s;s of Enemies, Mortification</HI> to the World, to ab&s;tain from <HI>ra&s;h Judg|ment,</HI> and to become not only <HI>hearers,</HI> but <HI>doers of the Word.</HI></P>
<P>This is the Sum and Sub&s;tance of this ad|mirable Sermon; in which you may per|ceive that our Saviour does not threaten them with <HI>the Terrors of the Law</HI>; nor was there any need he &s;hould; for this Di&s;cour&s;e being chiefly directed to his own Di&s;ciples, who had already e&s;caped the Bondage of the Law, to have threatned them with the Severity of that Di&s;pen&s;ation, would have been to turn them over again to their antient Bondage and Subjection. Law, &s;ays the Apo&s;tle, was <HI>our Schoolma&s;ter to bring us to Chri&s;t</HI>; but having entertain'd and embrac'd his Religion, <HI>we are no longer under a Schoolma&s;ter; but are all the Children of God, by Faith in Chri&s;t Je&s;us:</HI> For <HI>as many as are baptized into Chri&s;t, have put on Chri&s;t.</HI> Gal. 3.24 to 27th ver&s;e.&mdash;Neither is there any Thing here mentioned about <HI>Faith</HI>; for this al&s;o they had already declared, by leaving all to follow him.</P>
<P>The Truth is this.&mdash;The&s;e Men having
<PB N="11" REF="005554_0011_101866B01B6C5ED8">
already made Profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t, and yielded up them&s;elves to become his hearty and &s;in|cere Followers; and being received by him as Members of his Body, or of that Church, which he came to e&s;tabli&s;h, and whereof he him&s;elf is the Head, did not need a Di&s;cour&s;e about Faith, nor an Exhortation about com|ing to Chri&s;t, &s;o much as proper In&s;tructions in Regard to their Conduct and Behaviour as Chri&s;tians. They wanted &s;uitable Rules of In&s;truction, how they might live and act up to the Dignity of that holy Profe&s;&s;ion they had made; what Duties were incumbent upon them, in Con&s;equence of this their Chri&s;tian Profe&s;&s;ion; what Impediments they were likely to meet with; and what was the pro|per Method to remove them; or with what Temper and Di&s;po&s;ition they ought to &s;u&s;tain them.&mdash;The&s;e were Points more immediately nece&s;&s;ary to be opened and explained to Chri&s;tians, to Men who had already embraced the Faith of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>And accordingly we find our ble&s;&s;ed Sa|viour conde&s;cended to teach them the&s;e <HI>moral Duties.</HI> He did not flatter them with a Notion that their <HI>clo&s;ing with him,</HI> or <HI>getting an Intere&s;t in him,</HI> exempted them from
<PB N="12" REF="005554_0012_101866B4E7F36EA8">
<HI>moral Duties</HI>; but taught, that their Obli|gation to him was increas'd with their Pro|fe&s;&s;ion; and that they became the Te&s;t and Evidence of their Di&s;ciple&s;hip.&mdash;<HI>If ye love me</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>keep my Commandments.</HI> And again, <HI>He that keepeth my Commandments, he it is that loveth me.</HI> And St. <HI>John</HI> fur|ther a&s;&s;ures, that <HI>he who keepeth his Com|mandments, dwelleth in him, and he in him.</HI> <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">See more to this Purpo&s;e in the 1 <HI>Eph,</HI> St. <HI>John</HI> 2 chap. 5 and 6 ver&s; 3. And again, ch. 3.7 and 22 ver&s;es. And again, ch 5 ver. 3.</NOTE> It is not he that impudently pre&s;umes. It is not he who confidently claims an Intere&s;t in Chri&s;t, that &s;hall become Partaker of this Privilege; but he who gives Evidence of his Love to Chri&s;t, by <HI>keeping his Command|ments.</HI></P>
<P>Our Saviour's whole Sermon is indeed en|tirely compo&s;ed of &s;uch Points of Doctrine, as &s;ome by Way of Di&s;paragement, have pre|&s;umed to call <HI>moral Preaching,</HI> and <HI>legal In&s;truction.</HI> But &s;urely tho&s;e Men who had the Happine&s;s to hear him, had quite different Notions about Preaching, from the&s;e People. They, we read, were in Raptures; were fill'd with Admiration; were even a&s;toni&s;h'd at
<PB N="13" REF="005554_0013_101866B68F6A0B80">
his Doctrine. Even the unconverted Multi|tude plainly &s;aw the Excellence of his Di&s;|cour&s;e. That noble Maje&s;ty, and unaffected Simplicity of Expre&s;&s;ion, &s;urpri&s;ed and charmed them. They perceived the Doctrine came from God. They were convinced that a divine Authority attended him; becau&s;e the Precepts he taught were worthy of God; and had a direct and natural Tendency to promote the Happine&s;s of Men.</P>
<P>Upon other Occa&s;ions, when our Saviour im|mediately applied him&s;elf to tho&s;e who were Strangers to his Religion: He exhorts them to <HI>come unto him,</HI> to <HI>believe in him,</HI> and in his Doc|trine, that they <HI>might have Life. Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you Re&s;t. Take my Yoke upon you, and learn of me.</HI> Matt. 11.29. <HI>He that cometh unto me</HI> (&s;ays he to tho&s;e who fol|low'd him for the Loaves) <HI>&s;hall never hun|ger; and he that believeth on me, &s;hall never thir&s;t.</HI> John 6.35.&mdash; And &s;o Faith and Re|pentance were the Subject of the very fir&s;t Sermon he made, as we learn from the 4th of St. Matt. 17. <HI>From that time Je&s;us began to preach, and to &s;ay, Repent, for the King|dom of Heaven is at Hand.</HI>&mdash;He made a wide
<PB N="14" REF="005554_0014_101866BBE472FA78">
Difference in his preaching, when he directed him&s;elf to the unconverted Heathen World, from tho&s;e Applications which were addre&s;&s;ed to &s;uch as had already received him, and em|braced his Religion. The former he ex|horted to put away their old Sins and Idola|tries, to receive him for their Saviour, and take his Directions for their Way to Heaven. And therefore Repentance of their former wicked Life, and Faith in Chri&s;t, were the only proper nece&s;&s;ery Doctrines to be incul|cated upon &s;uch Men as the&s;e.&mdash;But for tho&s;e who had already received him by Faith, and who profe&s;t their Dependance on him as a Mediator and Guide, quite other Doctrine was nece&s;&s;ary. And therefore to the&s;e he preached the Doctrine of New Obedience; exhorted them to live &s;uitably to their holy Calling, by practi&s;ing the Duties of a holy, righteous, and godly Life; and not only to he innocent and unblameable them&s;elves; but according to their Power and Ability, to promote the general Welfare and Happine&s;s of all Mankind.</P>
<P>Thus I have examined the Nature of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour's Preaching.&mdash;I proceed,</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="15" REF="005554_0015_101866BDFB04A098">II. To enquire, Whether his Apo&s;tles did not teach the &s;ame Doctrine?</P>
<P>Now, in An&s;wer to this Enquiry, we mu&s;t con&s;ider their Preaching under two di&s;tinct Periods. The fir&s;t beginning from our Savi|our's A&s;cen&s;ion; and the De&s;cent of the Holy Gho&s;t con&s;equent upon it. And the other from the Settlement of Churches, Bodies, and Societies of Chri&s;tians, after the Religion of Je&s;us had made &s;ome Progre&s;s in the World.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e Periods &s;eems to be chiefly taken up in bringing Men over to the Chri&s;tian Faith. And accordingly the Points of Doctrine chiefly in&s;i&s;ted on, were the&s;e, <HI>Chri&s;t crucified, Je&s;us and the Re&s;urrection, Faith and Repentance, putting on Chri&s;t,</HI> being <HI>baptized into Chri&s;t,</HI> and the like: All which, and a great Number of Expre&s;|&s;ions of like Nature; of which their Ser|mons and Exhortations were full, do import neither more nor le&s;s than this: That the Death and Sufferings of Chri&s;t had made Attonement for the Sins of Mankind; that he had now opened a new and noble Way of reconciling Men to God. And in order that they might become Partakers of the&s;e
<PB N="16" REF="005554_0016_101866C2210AE878">
great Ble&s;&s;ings, it was nece&s;&s;ary that they &s;hould turn from their Idols and Vanities; and the Jews from their &s;ervile Dependance upon the Law; and believing tho&s;e Things which were &s;poken of Je&s;us, they &s;hould ac|knowledge him for their Saviour, embrace his Religion, and &s;ubmit to his Conduct and Di&s;cipline.&mdash;Here is no mention of Duties; the&s;e are re&s;erved for the &s;econd Period, when they come to addre&s;s to them as Chri&s;tians.&mdash; And indeed nothing could be more rea&s;on|able, than to exhort them to cloath them|&s;elves with the Chri&s;tian Profe&s;&s;ion, before they call upon them to practi&s;e the Duties of it. They mu&s;t fir&s;t own Chri&s;t for their Sa|viour, from whom Obedience to his Com|mands may rea&s;onably be expected. Ac|cordingly the Apo&s;tles all along in&s;i&s;t upon the Rea&s;on they had to acknowledge <HI>this &s;ame Je&s;us which was crucified, and ro&s;e again from the Dead,</HI> to be the true <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> or Saviour of the World; becau&s;e all the Pro|phecies which went before, concerning the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> were literally fulfilled, or accompli&s;h'd in him. <HI>Through this Man</HI> (&s;ays St. <HI>Paul</HI>) <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">Acts 13 38, 39.</NOTE> <HI>is preached unto you, the Forgivene&s;s
<PB N="17" REF="005554_0017_101866C86FDE0358">
of Sins. And by him all that believe are ju&s;tified from all Things from which ye could not be ju&s;tified by the Law of</HI> Mo&s;es.</P>
<P>Thus Faith and Repentance are the chief Subjects of the Apo&s;tles Doctrine, during this fir&s;t Period of their Mini&s;try; and while they were employ'd in bringing Men over to embrace the Chri&s;tian Religion.</P>
<P>But if we examine the &s;econd Period of their Labours, which they exercis'd towards tho&s;e who were already Chri&s;tians, who had profe&s;s'd their Faith in Chri&s;t, and had been received into his Church by Bapti&s;m; we &s;hall find that they entirely chang'd their Applications: They no longer now in&s;i&s;t upon Faith but Practice: The Duties that we owe to God, to our&s;elves, and to one another, are the chief Subjects of their Di&s;cour&s;es, in all their Epi&s;tles to the Chri&s;tian Churches. They now addre&s;s to them as Men who had already received the Chri&s;tian Faith; and therefore exhort them to &s;hew forth the Fruits of it in a Chri&s;tian Conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>Thus St. <HI>James</HI> in his Epi&s;tle to the twelve Tribes, earne&s;tly recommends the Duties of a Chri&s;tian Life; &s;uch as Charity, and Prayer, and Thank&s;giving, and Patience under
<PB N="18" REF="005554_0018_101866CA2C2C9BE8">
Afflictions; and warns them again&s;t the Vices of Pride and Intemperance, and De|traction, and ra&s;h Judgment. And becau&s;e &s;ome of them had entertain'd that wild Opi|nion of the Sufficiency of Faith, without a &s;uitable Practice, he largely handles this Ar|gument in the &s;econd Chapter; &s;hewing that the Faith of the Go&s;pel, without performing the Duties of it, will never &s;ave a Man.</P>
<P>Thus al&s;o St. <HI>Peter</HI> exhorts his Chri&s;tian Converts, to <NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">2 Eph <HI>Pet.</HI> chap. 1.5 and following Ver&s;es.</NOTE> <HI>add to their Faith, Virtue, Knowledge, Temperance, Patience, Godline&s;s, Brotherly Kindne&s;s, Charity;</HI> and a&s;&s;ures them, that <HI>he who lacketh the&s;e Things,</HI> is blind, and has forgot his Chri&s;tian Profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>But St. <HI>Paul</HI> is clearer in the Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Hebrews</HI>; where he clearly di&s;tingui&s;hes the Principles that are proper to be taught and in&s;i&s;ted on, with &s;uch as have not yet em|braced the Chri&s;tian Religion; &s;uch as Faith, and Repentance, and Bapti&s;m&punc; and the like, from tho&s;e which are proper to be offer'd to &s;uch as are already Chri&s;tians.

<P>Upon the Whole, from what has been all along &s;aid, I think it plainly appears, that they who of late have &s;o zealou&s;ly undertaken the Revival of Religion among&s;t us, have nei|ther in Doctrine, Method, or Language, copy'd after the Example of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour or his Apo&s;tles, in their Preaching; but in the Room of that native Simplicity and Eloquence with which the Scriptures of the New Te&s;tament abound, have &s;ub&s;tituted a boi&s;terous Appli|cation to the Pa&s;&s;ions, cloathed in dark unin|telligible Forms, and figurative Expre&s;&s;ions;

<P>If it &s;hould be a&s;k'd, Why Men profit no more under the pre&s;ent Admini&s;tration of the Go&s;pel, and tho&s;e Means which God affords to build us up in Holine&s;s unto Life Eternal?&mdash;I an&s;wer; the Fault is not in the Means; but in the Neglect of applying them in a hearty, &s;erious and affectionate Manner.&mdash;While Men are looking abroad, they &s;hould be &s;eeking at home for the true Rea&s;on of their Unfruitfulne&s;s.

And in&s;tead of &s;eeking new Ways and Means of Edification, they &s;hould be per&s;uaded to let tho&s;e they enjoy, have their proper and natural Influence.</P>
<P>And what renders the Ca&s;e extremely un|happy, is, that there are never wanting &s;uch, who&s;e Intere&s;t it is to teach and cheri&s;h the&s;e mi&s;conceived Opinions; and who endeavour to confirm Men in charging the Fault of their Barrenne&s;s upon the Profe&s;&s;ion they embrace, the Guide they follow, the In&s;tructions they re|ceive, the Prayers they join in, or the like. Now nothing &s;trikes in better with Men's corrupt Inclinations than this; for they are willing the Fault &s;hould re&s;t any where, rather than with them&s;elves; And being not fond of much Pains, are ready to hearken to &s;uch as offer to lighten their Burden, and promi&s;e them Heaven, with|out any Labour or Trouble; without &s;o much as the Pains of growing wi&s;er or better.</P>
<P>This, it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, is a melancholly Con&s;ideration.&mdash;Yet we, my Brethren, who have the Honour to &s;erve at the Altar, have no Rea&s;on to de&s;pond, or to be di&s;heartned at the&s;e Difficulties. The Reproaches of unrea&s;onable or mi&s;taken Men, are Things we are taught to expect, from the Examples of tho&s;e great and good Men who are gone before us, who in
<PB N="37" REF="005554_0037_10186709A0AD6AE0">
their Generation al&s;o endured the &s;ame Sight of Afflictions; had their Mini&s;try traduc'd, and all their pious Labours mi&s;repre&s;ented and wan|tonly defam'd. And in truth, by how much the more Regular and Di&s;creetly they con|ducted, by &s;o much the Greater was the Oppo|&s;ition they met with.&mdash;And tho' nothing can afford us greater Satisfaction of Mind, than to &s;ee the Intere&s;ts of Religion, and the Kingdom of Chri&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h'd, or gaining Ground in the Hearts of Men; yet &s;hould we by no means be di&s;couraged, tho' our Labours often fail of that Succe&s;s we hoped to reap from them. We are taught with Meekne&s;s and Patience to po&s;|&s;e&s;s our Souls under the&s;e Di&s;appointments, and to wait God's good time to render the&s;e La|bours &s;ucce&s;sful.&mdash;While we are contending with the perver&s;e Oppo&s;ition of a wicked and corrupt World, and endeavouring to captivate Mankind to the Obedience of Chri&s;t, can it be thought &s;trange, that the Powers of Darkne&s;s &s;hould ari&s;e again&s;t us? 'Tis doubtle&s;s what we ought to expect, and &s;hould therefore never be unprepar'd for.&mdash;'Tis our Duty to be doing all we can, never to faint or grow weary; but beg and intercede with God perpetually, for &s;till greater Degrees of his Grace, that we may be enabled to go on in this &s;piritual Warfare,

conquering and to conquer.&mdash;When our Duty lies thus plainly before us, he mu&s;t &s;urely be a very weak or un&s;teady Man, who can be di|verted from it, by the Oppo&s;itions of Profane|ne&s;s, or the Mi&s;repre&s;entations of mi&s;taken Zeal. It mu&s;t indeed be confe&s;s'd, that to pre&s;erve a &s;teady, regular, uniform Conduct, is a very difficult Thing. To feel all our own Cor|ruptions and Infirmities, and be obliged at the &s;ame Time to contend with the Perver&s;ene&s;s of other People, is doubtle&s;s a very difficult Pro|vince; and &s;uch, as without a large Portion of the divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance, we &s;hall very ill di&s;charge. &mdash;Whereas to give a loo&s;e to Ambition or Pride, to a licentious unbounded Character, is very agreeable to our corrupt Nature, and not difficult to excel in. It mu&s;t not therefore be thought &s;trange, if tho&s;e who de&s;pair to be di|&s;tingui&s;h'd in the orderly regular Way, which the Authority of God and Man have mark'd out to them, &s;hould de&s;pi&s;e and ca&s;t off the&s;e Re&s;traints, which confine their ambitious Spi|rits, and &s;hould give an unbounded Scope to their lawle&s;s De&s;ires.</P>
