<HEAD>The Tryal of a Saving Intere&s;t in CHRIST.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE there be &s;o many People living under the Ordinances, pre|tending without ground, to a &s;pe|cial Intere&s;t in Chri&s;t, and to His Favour and Salvation, as is clear, <HI>Mat.</HI> 7 22, 23. <HI>Mat.</HI> 25.11, 12. <HI>Luk.</HI> 13 24. And &s;ince many who have good ground of Claim to Chri&s;t, are not e|&s;tabli&s;hed in the confidence of His Favour, but remain in the Dark without comfort, he&s;itating concerning the reality of God|line&s;s in them&s;elves, and &s;peaking little to the Commendation of Religion to o|thers, e&s;pecially in the time of their &s;traits. I &s;hall &s;peak a little to two things of the greate&s;t Concernment.</P>
<P>The one is, <HI>How a per&s;on &s;hall know <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> he hath a true and &s;pecial intere&s;t in Christ;
<PB N="6" REF="000977_0005_0FAE8C88298FBD70">
and whether he doth lay lu&s;t Claim to Gods Favour and Salvation?</HI></P>
<P>The other is, <HI>In ca&s;e a per&s;on fall &s;hort in the afore&s;aid Tryal, what cour&s;e he &s;hall take for making &s;ure God; Friend&s;hip and Salvation to him&s;elf?</HI></P>
<P>Que&s;t. 1. <HI>How &s;hall a Man know if he hath a true and &s;pecial intere&s;t in Chri&s;t, and whether he hath or may lay claim ju&s;tly to Gods Favour and Salvation?</HI></P>
<P>An&s;w. Before we &s;peak directly to the Que&s;tion, we &s;hall premi&s;e &s;ome things to make way for the An&s;wer:</P>
<P>As,</P>
<P N="1">1. That a mans Intere&s;t in Chri&s;t, or Gracious State may be known, and that with more certainty than People do con|jecture; yea, and the knowledge of it may be more ea&s;ily attained unto, than many do imagine. For, not only hath the Lord commanded men to know their intere&s;t in Him, as a thing attainable, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13.5. 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.10. but many of the Saints have attained unto the clear per&s;wa&s;ion of their Intere&s;t in Chri&s;t&punc; and in God, as their own God: How often do they call him their God, and
<PB N="7" REF="000977_0006_0FAE8C88AAC2B760">
their Portion? And how per&s;waded is <HI>Paul</HI> that nothing can &s;eparate him from the Love of God? <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.38, 39. Therefore the knowledge of a mans Gra|cious &s;tate is attainable; and this know|ledge of it, which may be attained, is no fancie and bear conceit, but it is mo&s;t &s;ure; <HI>Doubtle&s;s thou art our Father,</HI> &s;aith the Prophet in name of the Church, <HI>I&s;a,</HI> 63.16. It is clear thus:</P>
<P N="1">1. That can be no fancy, but a very &s;ure knowledge, which doth yield to a rational man comfort in mo&s;t real &s;traits: But &s;o doth this. 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 30.6. When the People &s;pake of &s;toning <HI>David,</HI> he encouraged him&s;elf in the Lord, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> 6.

<P N="2">2. That is a &s;ure knowledge of a thing which maketh a wi&s;e Merchant <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> he hath that he may keep it &s;ure; that maketh a man fore go Chri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tian, Lands, Life, and &s;uffer the &s;poiling of all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oyfully&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;o doth this, <HI>Mat.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">3.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <HI>Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> 10.28, 29. <HI>Heb.</HI> 10.34. <HI>Rom.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.3. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="8" REF="000977_0007_0FAE8C896BC5A488">3. That mu&s;t be a &s;ure and certain knowledge, and no fancy, whereupon a man voluntarily and freely doth adven|ture his Soul, when he is &s;tepping in into Eternity with this word in his mouth, <HI>This is all my de&s;ire</HI>: But &s;uch a know|ledge is this, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 23.5. And again, Not only may a Godly man come to the &s;ure knowledge of his Gracious &s;tate, but it is more ea&s;ily attainable than many do apprehend: For (&s;uppo&s;ing what &s;hall be afterwards proved, that a man may know the gracious work of God<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Spirit in him&s;elf) if he will but argue ra|tionally from thence, he &s;hall be forced to conclude his intere&s;t in Chri&s;t, unle&s;s he deny clear Scripture truths.

A Godly man may argue thus&punc; Who&s;oever receives Chri&s;t, are ju&s;tly reputed the Children of God, <HI>Joh.</HI> 1.12.

Therefore may I &s;ay, and conclude plainly and warrantably, I am ju&s;tly to reckon my &s;elf Gods Child, according to the fore&s;aid Scripture which cannot fail.</P>
<P>The Second thing to be premi&s;ed, is, That a man be &s;avingly in Covenant with God, is matter of highe&s;t impor|tance. It is his Life, <HI>Deut.</HI> 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.47.

Few find, or walk in, the narrow way. This &s;hould allarum people to be &s;erious about the matter, &s;ince it is of &s;o great, Con&s;equence to be in Chri&s;t, And &s;ince there be but few that may lay ju&s;t clai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to him, and yet many do fooli&s;hly fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y an Intere&s;t in him, who are d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed by a fal&s;e confidence, as the <HI>fooli&s;h Virgine</HI> do, <HI>Mat.</HI> 25.</P>

in Chri&s;t. The Spirit &s;peaking in the Scripture, is judge of all Controver&s;ies; (<HI>I&s;a.</HI> 8.20. <HI>To the Law and the Prophets; and if it. &s;peak not according to the&s;e, there is no truth in it</HI>) and of this al&s;o, whether a man be &s;avingly in Covenant with God or not. Therefore do not mock God while you &s;eem to &s;earch after &s;uch a thing. If we prove from Scripture (which is the Uncontroverted rule) that you are Gracious, and have &s;tricken Covenant &s;avingly with God, then re&s;olve to grant &s;o much, and to acquei&s;e in it: and if the contray appear, let there be a determination of the Controver&s;ie, el&s;e you do but mock the Lord, and &s;o your bonds &s;hall be made &s;trong <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 28.22. For a jot of His Word cannot fail, <HI>Mat.</HI> 5.18. Therefore &s;eek Eye-&s;alve from Chri&s;t to judge of things according as the Word of God &s;hall di&s;cover them to be.</P>
<P>The Fourth thing to be premi&s;ed, is, Although the matter of a mans Intere&s;t in Chri&s;t be of &s;o great importance, and the way to attain to the knowledge of it, &s;o plai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> held forth in the Scriptures, yet there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> but few who reach the di&s;tinct knowledge of it.</P>

<P><HI>The First thing which doth hinder many from the Knowledge of their intere&s;t in Chri&s;t, is,</HI> Their Ignorance of &s;ome &s;pecial Prin|ciples of Religion:</P>
<P>As,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That it was free love in Gods bo&s;ome, and nothing in Man that moved him to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">end a Saviour to perfect the work of Re|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion.</HI> Joh. 3.16. <HI>God &s;o loved the wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ld, that he &s;ent, &amp;c.</HI> Men are &s;till &s;eeking &s;ome ground for that bu&s;ine&s;s in them&s;elves, which leads away from &s;uit|able and high apprehen&s;ions of the fir&s;t &s;pring and ri&s;e of Gods Covenant-favour to his People, which hath no rea&s;on, cau&s;e, or motive in us; and &s;o they can|not come to the Knowledge of their in|tere&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>They are</HI> Ignorant <HI>how that Love d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> effectually di&s;cover it &s;elf to a mans heart, &s;o as he hath ground to lay Claim to it,</HI> viz. That ordinarily it dot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> fir&s;t di&s;cover his

broken &s;tate in him&s;elf becau&s;e of Sin and Corruption, defiling the whole man, and any thing in him that may be called a Righteou&s;ne&s;s: All the&s;e things are Lo&s;s and Dung <HI>Phil.</HI> 3.6.7.</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>It di&s;covereth Christ as the full and &s;atisfying Trea&s;ure above all things.</HI> The man finds a trea&s;ure for which with joy, he &s;elleth all, <HI>&amp;c. Mat.</HI> 13.44, 46.</P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>It determineth the heart, and cau&s;eth it to approach unto a Living God in the Ordinances, P&s;al.</HI> 65.4. And cau&s;eth the Heart to lay weight upon Him, and Him alone, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 62.5. <HI>My Soul wait thou only upon God.</HI> Thus, having drop|ped in the Seed of God in the heart, and formed Chri&s;t there, <HI>Gal.</HI> 4.19. the Heart is changed and made new in the fore&s;aid work, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 36.26.

The Law is acknowledged Good, Holy, Ju&s;t and Spiritual: Upon all which, from that New Principle of Life, there flow out acts of a New Life, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Gal.</HI> 5.6. <HI>Faith works by Love.

Act.</HI> 24.16. Now, this way doth the love of God di&s;cover it &s;elf unto man, and acteth on him &s;o as he hath ground of laying &s;ome good claim to it; &s;o as he may ju&s;tly think, that the love which &s;ent a Savi|our, had re&s;pect to &s;uch a man as hath found the&s;e things made out unto him. Surely, <HI>Ignorance</HI> in this doth hinder man from the knowledge of their intere&s;t in Chri&s;t: For if a man know not how God worketh with a per&s;on, &s;o as he may ju&s;tly lay claim to His love, which was from Eternity, he will wander in the Dark, &amp; not come to the knowledge of an Intere&s;t in Him.</P>

<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The man falleth at odds with his former Companion.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> He dareth not &s;peak a wrong word of God, who&s;e hand is on him, but Ju&s;tifieth Him in all that is befallen him.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> He now &s;ees Je&s;us Chri&s;t per|&s;ecuted by the world, without a cau&s;e, and mo&s;t injuriou&s;ly.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly</HI> He di&s;covereth Chri&s;t to be a Lord and a King, while&s;t Enemies &s;eem to have Him at under.</P>

<P><HI>Sixthly,</HI> Although he was much aba&s;ed in him&s;elf, &amp; &s;o humbled, that he pleaded,

but that Chri&s;t would remember him; yet he was nobly daring to throw him|&s;elf upon the Covenant, on Life and Death: and he had &s;o much Faith of Chri&s;ts Al-&s;ufficiency, that he judged a &s;imple remembrance from Chri&s;t, would &s;atisfyingly do his bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Seventhly.</HI> He acquie&s;ed &s;weetly in the Word which Chri&s;t &s;pake to him, for the ground of his Comfort. All which are very clear in the ca&s;e of that poor dying Man, and do prove a very real work of God upon his Heart. As this example may encourage &s;ome to wait for good from God, who cannot as yet lay clear claim to any Gracious work of His Spirit: So we obte&s;t all, as they love their Souls, not to delay their Soul-bu&s;i|ne&s;s, hoping for &s;uch a ca&s;t of Chri&s;ts hand in end, as too many do: This be|ing a rare miracle of Mercy, with the Glory whereof Chri&s;t did honourably triumph over the ignominy of His cro&s;s, a parallel of which we &s;hall hardly find in all the Scripture be&s;ide. Yea, as there be but few at all &s;aved, <HI>Mat.</HI> 20.16. and mo&s;t &s;aved this way: &s;o the Lord hath peremptorily threatned to laugh at the Calamity, and not to hear the Cry

of &s;uch as mocked formerly at His re|proof, and would not hear when He called to them: <HI>Prov.</HI> 1.24, 26. which Scripture, although it doth not &s;hut Mer|cies door upon any who at the hour of Death do &s;incerely judge them&s;elves and flee to Chri&s;t, as this penitent Thief did: yet it is certain, it implyeth that very few who &s;it the offer until then, are honoured with Repentance as he was. And &s;o their Cry as not being &s;incere and of the right &s;tamp, &s;hall not be heard.</P>
<P>The Fourth and mo&s;t Ordinary way, by which many are brought in to Chri&s;t' is, <HI>By a clear and di&s;cernable work of the Law and Humiliation, which we ordinarily call,</HI> The Spirit of Bondage, <HI>as was h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nted before.</HI> We do not mean, that every one who&s;e Con&s;cience is awakened with Sin and fear of Wrath, doth really clo&s;e with Chri&s;t, the contrary doth appear in <HI>Cain, Saul, Judas &amp;c.</HI> but there is a convicti-of Sin, awakening of Con&s;cience, and work of Humiliation, which, as we &s;hall circum&s;tantiate it, doth rarely mi&s;carry or fail of a gracious i&s;&s;ue, but ordina|rily doth re&s;olve into the Spirit of A|doption, and a Gracious work of Gods

Spirit. And becau&s;e the Lord dealeth with many Sinners this way, and we find that many are much puzled about the giving judgment of this Law-work.</P>
<P>This work is either more violent and &s;uddenly expede, or it is more &s;ober and lent, protracted through a greater length of time, and &s;o as the &s;teps of it are very di&s;cernable.

<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The per&s;on accepteth the con|dition offered by Chri&s;t and His Servants, as is clear in the fore-cited Scriptures.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> The per&s;on pre&s;ently be|cometh of one intere&s;t with the Saints, joyning him&s;elf with that per&s;ecuted &s;o|ciety, putting re&s;pect on tho&s;e, whom he had formerly per&s;ecuted, joyning and continuing with them in the profe&s;|&s;ion of Chri&s;t on all hazards. Tho&s;e with whom the Lord hath &s;o dealt, have much to &s;ay for a gracious work of Gods &s;pirit in them: and it is like, many of them can date their work from &s;uch a particular time and word, or di&s;pen&s;ation, and can give &s;ome account of what, pa&s;t between God and them, and of a &s;en&s;ible Change following in them from that time forward, as <HI>Paul</HI> giveth a good account of the work and way of God with him afterwards, <HI>Act.</HI> 22.</P>

I grant, he that believeth or Chri&s;t Je|&s;us, believeth what God hath &s;aid about mans Sinful Mi&s;erable condition by Na|ture, and he believeth that to be true, that there is Life in the Son, who was Slain, and is Ri&s;en again from the Dead, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But none of the&s;e, nor the believing of many &s;uch Truths, do &s;peak out ju&s;ti|fying Faith, or that Believing on the Son of God &s;poken of in Scripture: for, then it were &s;imply an act of the Under&s;tand|ing. But true Ju&s;tifying Faith, which we now &s;eek after, as a good mark of an Intere&s;t in Chri&s;t, is chiefly and princi|pally an act or work of the heart and will, having pre&s;uppo&s;ed &s;undry things about Truth in the under&s;tanding, with the Heart it is believed unto Salvation, <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.10.

So under the New-Covenant, when God giveth the New Heart to man, He &s;ets the <HI>Idea</HI> and <HI>Stamp</HI> of all His device in the New-Covenant upon the man, &s;o as there is a con&s;onan|cy to Gods will there: Thus he beareth the Image of the Second <HI>Adam,</HI> CHRIST JESUS on him. This is a great part of the new heart, and is mo&s;t oppo&s;ed to works. Since now the man ab&s;olutely falleth off works, becoming Dead to the Law (as to the point of Ju&s;tification) by the Body of Chri&s;t, <HI>Rom.</HI> 7.4. Many perceiving that God hath devi&s;ed a way of &s;atisfying Divine ju&s;tice, and recover|ing lo&s;t man by the Incarnation of Chri&s;t, he thinks this &s;o good and &s;ure a way, that he ab&s;olutely giveth up with the Law, as I &s;aid before, and clo&s;eth with this device: and this is Believing or Faith, very oppo&s;ite to works and all re&s;ting thereupon.

<P>Now, I &s;ay, this Faith is di&s;cernable, not only in the&s;e actings many times; a man may know if his heart doth hun|ger after Chri&s;t, and flee for refuge to him when pur&s;ued, and if he doth com|mit him&s;elf unto God, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But al&s;o in its very Nature; as it is ju&s;tifying it is di&s;cernable and may be known.

Scriptural truths. I offer the&s;e differen|ces between the Faith of all Hypocrites or Reprobates, and that true &s;aving ju&s;ti|fying Faith, whereof we have &s;poken.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>They never clo&s;e with Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> (in that device) <HI>and Him alone as a &s;uf|ficient covering of the eyes, as is &s;aid of</HI> A|braham <HI>to</HI> Sarah, <HI>Gen.</HI> 20.16. They &s;till hold fa&s;t &s;omewhat of their own, at lea&s;t to help to procure Gods favour and &s;al|vation: Their heart doth &s;till &s;peak, as that Young mans &s;peech, <HI>Luk.</HI> 18.18, 21. doth in&s;inuate, what want I that I may inherit Life? Be&s;ies that, they do &s;till retain their former Lovers, and will not break their Covenants with Hell and Death, imagining they may have Chri&s;t with the&s;e things equally &s;haring in their heart; contrary to that, <HI>A man cannot &s;erve two Ma&s;ters, Mat.</HI> 6.24. Either Chri&s;t mu&s;t be judged ab&s;olute Lord, and worthy to be &s;o, or nothing at all. And &s;o it is clear, their heart is not &s;hapen out for that device of Salvati|on by Chri&s;t, whom God hath alone made Lord here, in whom all fulne&s;s &s;hall dwell. But where ju&s;tifying Faith is, the Soul of a man and his Heart doth clo&s;e with Chri&s;t, and him alone, having <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">

<P N="2">2. <HI>As Hypocrites and Reprobates do never clo&s;e with Chri&s;t Alone; &s;o they do never clo&s;e with Full Chri&s;t, as He is anointed to be a King to rule over man in all things; a Priest, to procure Pardon and to make peace for man upon all occa&s;ions; a Prophet to be Wi&s;dom, and a Teacher and Coun&s;ellor in all ca&s;es to man.</HI> So they do not receive Chri&s;t, e&s;pecially in the fir&s;t and third Office.

<P>I &s;hall &s;hortly hint &s;ome of the&s;e excel|lent Communications, and I hope upon a right di&s;covery of them there will be but &s;mall ground found for the jealous com|plaints of many Gracious people.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, (Be&s;ide the&s;e Convictions of the Spirit of God, which u&s;e to u&s;her Chri&s;ts way unto the Souls of men, and the&s;e al&s;o which afterwards do ordinarily at|tend them) <HI>There is a Seal of the Spirit of God &s;poken of in Scripture</HI>; the principal thing whereof is the Sanctifying work of the holy Gho&s;t, imprinting the draughts and lineaments of Gods Image and Re|vealed will upon a man, as a &s;eal or &s;ig|net doth leave an impre&s;&s;ion and &s;tamp of its likene&s;s upon the thing Sealed, &s;o it is, 2 Tim. 2.19. <HI>The foundation of God &mdash; having this Seal; the Lord knoweth them who are His. And let every one that nameth the Name of Chri&s;t, depart from iniquity.</HI> And thus I conceive the &s;eal to be called a witne&s;s, 1 Joh. 5 10. <HI>He that believeth hath the witne&s;s in him&s;elf</HI>; that is, the
<PB N="108" REF="000977_0105_0FAE8CB36DDF83D8">
grounds upon which an intere&s;t in Chri&s;t is to be made out, and proved, are in every Believer; for he hath &s;omewhat of the &s;anctifying work of Gods Spirit in him, which is a &s;ure (although not al|wayes a clear and manife&s;t) witne&s;s.</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>There is Communion with God much talked of among Chri&s;tians, where|by they under&s;tand the &s;en&s;ible pre&s;en&s;e of God refre&s;hing the Soul exceedingly.</HI> But if we &s;peak properly, Communion with God is a mutual intere&s;t between God and a man, who hath clo&s;ed with him in Chri&s;t. It is a common-ne&s;s or a common intere&s;t between God and a Man; not only is a man intere&s;ted in God Him&s;elf, but in all that is the Lords: &s;o the Lord hath a &s;pecial intere&s;t in the man, and al&s;o all that belongs to him. There is a Commu|nion between Husband and Wife, where|by they have a &s;pecial intere&s;t in others, per&s;ons, goods, gear and concernments, &s;o it is here; there is &s;uch a Communi|on with God. He is our God, and all things are ours, becau&s;e He is ours: this Communion with God all true Believers have at all times, as we &s;hall &s;hew after|wards: I grant there is an actual im|provement
<PB N="109" REF="000977_0106_0FAE8CB42EA54CA8">
of that Communion, whereby men do boldly meddle with any thing that belongs unto God, and do meddle with Him&s;elf as their own, with much homeline&s;s and familiarity, e&s;pecially in Wor&s;hip, when the Soul doth conver&s;e with a living God, partaking of the Divine Nature, growing like unto Him, and &s;weetly travelling through his At|tributes, and with &s;ome confidence of intere&s;t, viewing the&s;e things as the mans own goods and gear: this we call Com|munion with God in Ordinances: This indeed is not &s;o ordinarily nor frequent|ly made out to men, and all Gods Peo|ple do not equally partake of it; and it is true, that what is in God, goeth not out for the behove of the man, to his ap|prehen&s;ion equally at all times, yet cer|tainly Communion with God, properly &s;o called, <HI>viz.</HI> that common-ne&s;s of <HI>Intere&s;t</HI> between God and a Man who is &s;avingly in Covenant with Him, doth alwayes &s;tand firm and &s;ure; and &s;o much of Com|munion with God in Ordinances have all Believers, as that their heart conver&s;eth with a living God there now and then, and is in &s;ome mea&s;ure changed into that &s;ame image, and there needs be no doubt about any further in it.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="000977_0107_0FAE8CB55D846580">Thirdly, <HI>There is a thing which is called Fell<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w&s;hip with God, often mi&s;taken al&s;o among&s;t Believers.</HI> If by fellow&s;hip be meant the walking in our duty as in the &s;ight of a living God, who &s;eeth and heareth us, and is witne&s;s to all our carriage. It is a thing common unto all gracious men, they all have it habitually, and in de|&s;ign, P&s;al. 16.8. <HI>I have &s;et the Lord al|wayes before me</HI>; yea, and often they have it actually in exerci&s;e, when their &s;pirit is in any good frame; they walk as if they &s;aw God &s;tanding by them, and have &s;ome thoughts of His favour through Chri&s;t; <HI>Truly our fellow&s;hip is with the Father and with His Son,</HI> 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 1.3. If we by <HI>Fellow&s;hip,</HI> do mean a &s;weet, refre&s;hing, familiar, &s;en&s;ible conver&s;ing with God, which doth delight and refre&s;h the Soul, (be&s;ide what the Con&s;cience of Duty doth) it is then a walking in the light of His Countenance, and a good part of &s;en|&s;ible pre&s;ence; and although it &s;eemeth <HI>Enoch</HI> had much of it, while&s;t it is &s;aid, <HI>He walked with God, Gen.</HI> 5.24. yet it is not &s;o ordinary as the former, nor &s;o common to all Chri&s;tians, for here the Soul is filled as with marrow and fatne&s;s,

<P>Fourthly, <HI>There is a thing which is cal|led Acce&s;s unto God:</HI> and this I take to be the removing of ob&s;tructions out of the way between a man and God, &s;o as the man is admitted to come near. We are &s;aid to have acce&s;s to a great per&s;on, when doors are ca&s;t open, guards re|moved from about him, and we admit|ted to clo&s;e at him; &s;o it is here. Now this Acce&s;s in Scripture, is &s;ometimes taken for Chri&s;ts preparing of the way, the re|moving of enmity between God and &s;in|ners; &s;o as men now have a patent way to come unto God through Chri&s;t, <HI>Eph,</HI> 2.18. Sometimes it is taken for the actual improvement of that Ac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;s pur|cha&s;ed by Chri&s;t, when a man finds all <HI>obstructions</HI> and <HI>differences,</HI> which do or|dinarily fall in between him and God, re|moved; God is not uncouth to him, nor as a &s;tranger, keeping up him&s;elf from him, or frowning on him, but the man is admitted to come even to his &s;eat, as <HI>Job</HI> 23.3. Of the want of this doth <HI>Job</HI> complain, <HI>Job</HI> 23.8, 9 whil&s;t he &s;aith, I go forward, backward, to the right and
<PB N="112" REF="000977_0109_0FAE8CB815CCDB38">
left hand, &amp; I find him not. The <HI>first</HI> &s;ort of Acce&s;s is common to all Believers, they are brought near by the Blood of the Covenant, and are no more far off, as the deadly enmity between God and them is removed. But Acce&s;s, in the other &s;en&s;e, is di&s;pen&s;ed more, according to the Lords ab&s;olute &s;overaignty and plea|&s;ure, and it is left in the power of Be|lievers to ob&s;truct it unto them&s;elves, until it plea&s;e the Lord mercifully and freely to grant unto them again, &s;o it is up and down, and there needs be no que&s;tion, as to a mans &s;tate) about it.</P>
<P>Fifthly, <HI>There is a thing called Liberty before God, and this properly is freedom, or free &s;peaking unto God.</HI> Many do much que&s;tion their &s;tate, becau&s;e of the want of this now and then, &s;ince the Scripture hath &s;aid, <HI>Where the Spirit is, there is Li|berty,</HI> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.17. but they do ju&s;tly con|fine that liberty &s;poken of there, unto this free &s;peaking before God. I grant where the &s;pirit of the Lord doth &s;a|vingly di&s;cover Gods will in the Scrip|tures to a man, there is liberty from a|ny obligation to the Ceremonial-Law, and from the Condemning power of the
<PB N="113" REF="000977_0110_0FAE8CB9022A5DF8">
Moral-Law, and from much of that gro&s;s Darkne&s;s and Ignorance, which is on Na|tural hearts as a vail hiding Chri&s;t in the Go&s;pel from them. I grant al&s;o, that &s;ometimes, even this liberty which is a free communing with God, and ordering of our cau&s;e before him, and filling of our mouths with arguments, <HI>Job</HI> 23.4. is granted to the Godly, but not as liber|ty taken in the former &s;en&s;es. Although the Lord hath obliged Him&s;elf to pour out the Spirit of Prayer upon all the hou&s;e of <HI>David</HI> in &s;ome mea&s;ure, <HI>Zech.</HI> 12.10. yet this Communication of the Spirit, which we call liberty or free &s;peak|ing unto God, dependeth much on the Lords ab&s;olute plea&s;ure, when, and in what mea&s;ure to allow it. This liberty which we call freedom, or free &s;peaking with God in Prayer, is &s;ometimes much ab&s;tracted from any great confidence in the time of Prayer, (<HI>at lea&s;t until it draw toward the clo&s;e of it</HI>) it &s;tandeth much in a vivacity of the under&s;tanding to take up the ca&s;e which a man is to &s;peak be|fore God, &s;o as he can order his cau&s;e; and next, there be words, or verbal ex|pre&s;&s;ions, elegant, &s;uitable, and very emphatical or powerful, or pithy; there

is al&s;o joyned a fervency of Spirit in Prayer whereof the Scripture &s;peaketh; <HI>The Soul is hot and bended and very intent</HI>: there is al&s;o ordinarily in this liberty a &s;pec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">al melting of the heart (<HI>often joined with a great mea&s;ure of the Spirit of Grace &amp; Supplication, Zech.</HI> 11.10) &s;o the Soul is poured out before God as for a <HI>Fir&s;t-born</HI>: &s;uch is the liberty which many Saints get before God, while&s;t in much broken|ne&s;s of Heart and fervency of &s;pirit they are admitted to &s;peak their mind fully to God, as a living God, noticing (<HI>at lea&s;t</HI>) their Prayer. Sometimes this liberty is joyned with Confidence, and then it is not only a free, but al&s;o a bold &s;peak|ing before God: <HI>It is that Boldne&s;s with Confidence, Eph.</HI> 3.12. This is more rarely imparted unto men then the for|mer, yet it is ordinarily. It hath in it, be&s;ide what we &s;pake before, &s;ome in|fluence of the Spirit upon Faith, making it put out &s;ome vigorous acting in Prayer; there is a &s;weet mournful frame of Spirit, by which a man poureth out his heart in Gods bo&s;ome, and with &s;ome confidence of His favour and good-will, pleadeth his cau&s;e before him, as a Living God; and this is all the &s;en&s;ible pre&s;ence that
<PB N="115" REF="000977_0112_0FAE8CBA7B5EC2D0">
many Sains do attain unto: There is no ground of doubt about a mans &s;tate in the point of Liberty before God in this la&s;t &s;en&s;e, becau&s;e there is nothing e&s;&s;en|tial to the making up of a Gracious &s;tate here: &s;ome have it, &s;ome want it, &s;ome have it at &s;ome times and not at other times, &s;o that it is much up and down; yet I may &s;ay, Gracious men may do much (by a very ordinary influence) contributing towards the attaining and retaining, or keeping of &s;uch a frame of Spirit.</P>
<P>Sixthly, <HI>There is a thing called, Influence or Breathing of the Spirit.</HI> This gracious influence (for of &s;uch only do I now &s;peak) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> either ordinary, and this is the operation of the Holy Spirit on the Soul and the habits of Grace there, whereby they are &s;till kept alive and in &s;ome exerci&s;e and acting, although not very di&s;cernable. This influence (<HI>I con|ceive)</HI> doth alwayes attend Believers, &amp; is that <HI>Keeping</HI> and <HI>Watering</HI> night and day, and every moment, promi&s;ed. <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 27.3. Or, this influence is more &s;ingu|lar and &s;pecial, and is that &s;ame to a gracious (although a withered) Soul, as the wind and breath to the dry Bones,
<PB N="116" REF="000977_0113_0FAE8CBB2D9A4D18">

When the Spirit moveth thus, there is an edge put upon the Graces of God in the Soul, and they are made to act more vi|gorou&s;ly. This is the enlarging of the heart, by which a man doth run in the wayes of God, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 119.32. This in|fluence is more di&s;cernable than the for|mer, and not &s;o ordinarily communicated. Al&s;o here, &s;ometimes the wind bloweth more upon one Grace, and &s;ometimes more di&s;cernable upon another; and often upon many of the Graces together, and according to the le&s;&s;er or greater mea&s;ure of this influence, the Soul acteth more or le&s;s vigorou&s;ly towards God: and &s;ince faith is a Created Grace in the Soul this <HI>Influence</HI> of the Spirit is upon it, &s;ome|times le&s;s, &s;ometimes more, and accord|ingly is the a&s;&s;urance of Faith &s;mall or great.</P>
<P>Seventhly, <HI>There is the hearing of Pray|er, often &s;poken of in Scripture; and many vex them&s;elves about it, alleging that they
<PB N="117" REF="000977_0114_0FAE8CBBB1563FC0">
know nothing of it experimentally.</HI> I grant there is a favourable hearing of Prayer: But we mu&s;t remember it is twofold.</P>
<P>Either;</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>It is &s;uch as a man is &s;imply to believe by way of Argument on Scriptural grounds.</HI> As if I be fled unto Chri&s;t, and do ap|proach unto God in him, pray accord|ing to His Will, not regarding iniquity in my heart, exerci&s;ing Faith about the thing I pray for, ab&s;olutely or conditi|onally, according to the nature of the thing and promi&s;es about it. I am ob|liged to believe that God heareth my Prayer and will give what is good, ac|cording to the&s;e Scriptures, <HI>Joh.</HI> 14.13, 14. <HI>What&s;oever you ask in my Name, I will do it,</HI> 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 5.14. This is our confidence that what&s;oever we ask according to His Will, He heareth us, <HI>Mark,</HI> 11.24. Be|lieve that you receive and you &s;hall have what you do de&s;ire, P&s;al. 66.18. <HI>If I re|gard Iniquity, He will not hear.</HI> Then if I regard not Iniquity, I may believe that He doth hear me.

God did &s;tamp in &s;ome way up|on her heart &s;en&s;ibly, and &s;o made her believe it. This is but rarely granted, e&s;pecially in ca&s;es clearly deducible in Scripture. And therefore people are much to be &s;atisfied in exer|ci&s;ing their Faith about the other, and let God give of this latter what He plea|&s;eth. A mans gracious &s;tate &s;hould not be brought upon debate, upon the ac|count of &s;uch hearing of Prayer.</P>
<P>Eighthly, <HI>There is A&s;&s;urance of Gods Favour by the witne&s;&s;ing of our own Spirits</HI>: which A&s;&s;urance, is deduced by way of argument <HI>Sylogi&s;tically</HI>; Thus, who&s;oever Believeth on Chri&s;t &s;hall never Peri&s;h; <HI>But I do Believe on Chri&s;t: Therefore I &s;hall never Peri&s;h.</HI> Who&s;o hath re&s;pect unto all Gods Commandments &s;hall never be a&s;hamed; <HI>But I have re&s;pect unto all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">is Commandments: Therefore I &s;hall never be

a&s;hamed.</HI> I &s;ay, by rea&s;oning thus, and comparing &s;piritual things with &s;piritual things, a man may attain unto a good certainty of his gracious &s;ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e. It is &s;up|po&s;ed, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.18, 19. that by loving the Brethren in deed and in truth, we may a&s;&s;ure our hearts before God; and that a man may rejoyce upon the te&s;ti|mony of a good Con&s;cience, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.12 A man may have confidence if his heart do not Condemn him, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.21 We may then attain unto &s;ome A&s;&s;urance (al|though not full A&s;&s;urance) by the wit|ne&s;s of our own &s;pirits. I do not deny, that in this witne&s;&s;ing of our &s;pirits to|wards A&s;&s;urance, there is &s;ome concur|rence of the Spirit of God: But I con|ceive, there needeth but a very ordinary influence, without which we can do no|thing. Now, this A&s;&s;urance, &s;uch as it is, may be reached by intelligent Believers, who keep a good Con&s;cience in their walk. So, I hope, there needs be no de|bate about it, as to a mans gracious &s;tate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> for if a man will clear him&s;elf of Heart-condemnings, he will &s;peedily reach this A&s;&s;urance.</P>
<P>Ninthly, <HI>There is a witne&s;&s;ing of Gods &s;pirit, mentioned,</HI> Rom. 8.16. <HI>A bearing
<PB N="120" REF="000977_0117_0FAE8CBFAF4929E0">
witne&s;s with our Spirits, that we are the Chil|dren of God.</HI> This operation of the Spirit, is be&s;t under&s;tood,, if we produce any &s;yllogi&s;m by which our &s;pirit do witne&s;s our Son-&s;hip: As for example, Who&s;o|ever loveth the Brethren, is pa&s;t from Death to Life, and con&s;equently is in Chri&s;t; <HI>But I love the Brethren: Therefore I am pa&s;t from Death to Life.</HI> Here there is a threefold operation of the Spirit, or three operations rather. The <HI>First</HI> is a beam of Divine light upon the fir&s;t pro|po&s;ition, per&s;wading the Divine authori|ty of it, as the Word of God: The Spirit of the Lord mu&s;t witne&s;s the Divinity of the Scripture; and that is the infalli|ble Word of God, far beyond all other arguments can be u&s;ed. The <HI>Second</HI> operation is, a Glorious beam of light from the Spirit, &s;hining upon the &s;econd propo&s;ition, and &s;o upon his own graces in the Soul, di&s;covering them to be true Graces, and &s;uch as the Scripture calleth &s;o. Thus we are &s;aid to know by His Spirit the things freely given unto us of God, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.13. The <HI>Third</HI> operation is in order to the third propo&s;ition of the argument, or the conclu&s;ion; and this I conceive to be nothing el&s;e but
<PB N="121" REF="000977_0118_0FAE8CC0ADCCFDA8">
an influence upon Faith, &s;trengthning it to draw a conclu&s;ion of full a&s;&s;urance up|on the fore&s;aid premi&s;es. Now (with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion unto others, who have greater light in the Scripture, and more expe|rience of the&s;e communications) I do conceive the witne&s;s of the Spirit, or witne&s;&s;ing of it, which is mentioned, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.16. is not that fir&s;t operation upon the fir&s;t propo&s;ition; for, that ope|ration is that te&s;timony of the Spirit, by which He beareth witne&s;s to the Divini|ty of the whole Scripture, and a&s;&s;erteth the Divine authority of it unto the &s;ouls of Gracious men, and &s;uch an operati|on may be upon a truth of Scripture, which doth not relate to a mans Son-&s;hip or Intere&s;t in Chri&s;t at all. The Spirit may &s;o &s;hine upon any truth, relating to Duty, or any other fundamental truth per&s;wading the Divinity of it, upon and unto the &s;oul, and &s;peak nothing relating to a mans intere&s;t in Chri&s;t. Neither is the third operation of the Spirit, by which He makes Faith boldly draw the conclu&s;ion. This witne&s;&s;ing of the Spirit for that operation, is nothing el&s;e but <HI>influence</HI> upon Faith, bringing it out to full a&s;&s;urance; but that whereupon this
<PB N="122" REF="000977_0119_0FAE8CC0EFA30D98">

Gracious &s;tate upon debate for want of it.</P>
<P>Eleventhly, <HI>There is a thing we call Peace, about which many do vex them&s;elves.</HI> This Peace is either about a mans &s;tate, that he is reconciled unto God by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, or it is about his pre&s;ent ca&s;e and condition, thas he is walking &s;o, as ap|proven of God, at lea&s;t &s;o far, as there is no quarrel or controver&s;ie between God and him threatning a &s;troke: both of the&s;e are either &s;uch in the court of Scripture, and con&s;equently in Gods ac|count, or in the court of a mans Con|&s;cience. Peace about a mans &s;tate, as being in Chri&s;t, is &s;ure in the Court of Scripture and of Heaven, when a man doth by Faith clo&s;e with Chri&s;t and New-Covenant, Rom. 5.1. <HI>Being ju&s;tifyed by Faith, we have Peace with God</HI>; it being &s;ure and &s;olid in the Court of Scripture, it &s;hould <HI>hold</HI> &s;ure in the Court of a mans Con&s;cience, it being rightly inform|ed, for in that ca&s;e, it &s;till &s;peaks ac|cording to Scripture: but becau&s;e often the Con&s;cience is misinformed and in the dark, therefore there is often Peace about a mans &s;tate according to Scripture, while&s;t his Con&s;cience doth threaten the

In this ca&s;e, the Con&s;cience mu&s;t be inform|ed, and the mans Gracious &s;tate made out by the marks of Grace, as we &s;hew before; and here the witne&s;s of my own &s;pirit, will do much to allay the Cry of the Con&s;cience, and if the Spirit of the Lord joyn His witne&s;s and te&s;timony, the Con&s;cience is perfectly &s;atisfied, and proclameth Peace to the man. The o|ther Peace, about a mans pre&s;ent ca&s;e or condition, <HI>viz.</HI> that it is approven of God in a Go&s;pel &s;en&s;e, it may be want|ing, and ju&s;tly wanting, although the o|ther Peace about a mans &s;tate be &s;ure.

<PB N="127" REF="000977_0124_0FAE8CC4C5DAC398">
the Con&s;cience is often in the dark, there|fore a man may be alarm'd with evil in the Court of Con&s;cience, as if he were ju&s;tly to expect a &s;troak from God be|cau&s;e of his &s;in, and &s;ome quarrel God hath at him, although He intend &s;alvati|on for him; this is enough to keep a man in disquiet, and to inhibit him the rejoycing allowed upon him, while&s;t he is walking in his integrity: therefore a man mu&s;t here al&s;o inform his Con&s;ci|ence, and receive no accu&s;ations nor con|demnings from it, unle&s;s it make them clear by <HI>Scripture:</HI> at that bar, let every man &s;tand, both about his &s;tate and his condition or ca&s;e; and let him appeal from all other Courts to that, and not receive any indictment but conform to the truth of God, by which the Con|&s;cience is to proceed in all things; and if this were well lookt unto, there would not be &s;o many groundle&s;s &s;u&s;picions a|mong&s;t the Lords People, either about their &s;tate or their condition upon every thought which entertain their mind.</P>

all the gods there is none like un|to HIM, and he looketh out as a &s;ufficient covering of the Eyes to all who get him. Upon which the heart loveth Gods de|vice in the New-Covenant, and loveth to lay its weight upon Chri&s;t rather than any other way, bending towards him, and &s;o the man becometh a Believer. Now, I will not &s;ay that all the&s;e things whereof we have &s;poken, are formally, orderly and di&s;tinctly found in every per|&s;on before he clo&s;e with God in Chri&s;t; for the way of the heart with Chri&s;t, may be added to the four wonderful things, <HI>Prov.</HI> 18.19.

<P>The Fourth thing we propo&s;ed to &s;peak to, is, <HI>The properties of this Duty when rightly gone about.</HI> I &s;hall only hint a few.</P>

Neither will it &s;uffice that Parents did in &s;ome re&s;pect engage for their Children, and give them away unto God: all the&s;e things do not avail. The Children of the Kingdom and of Godly Predece&s;&s;ors are ca&s;t out; unle&s;s a man in his own per&s;on put out Faith in <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</HI> and with his own heart plea&s;e and acquie&s;e in that device of &s;aving Sinners, he cannot be Saved.

Rom.</HI> 10.10. A man mu&s;t be &s;in|cere and without guile in clo&s;ing with Chri&s;t, judging Him the only covering of the Eyes, not hanckering after another way. The matter mu&s;t not &s;wim only in the head, or under&s;tanding; but it mu&s;t be in the heart: the man not only mu&s;t be per&s;waded that <HI>CHRIST</HI> is the way, but affectionately per&s;waded of it, loving and liking the thing, having com|placency in it; &s;o that it is a mans de|&s;ire, as <HI>David</HI> &s;peaketh of the Covenant, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 23.5.

<P>The third property or qualification of believing as it goeth out after Chri&s;t, <HI>It mu&s;t be Rational.</HI> Hereby I mean that the man &s;hould move towards God in Chri&s;t, in knowledge and under&s;tanding, taking up Gods device of &s;aving Sinners by <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> as the Scripture doth hold it out, not phan&s;ying a CHRIST to him|&s;elf other wayes than the Go&s;pel &s;peaketh of Him, nor any other way of relief by him than the Word of God holdeth out.

<P N="1">1. It is <HI>Avowed:</HI> that is, not &s;eeking to &s;helter or hide it &s;elf. The Pha|ri&s;ees &s;pake again&s;t Chri&s;t publickly, <HI>Mat</HI> 12.24.

<P N="2">2. The party acteth <HI>Freely</HI>: It is not from unadvi&s;edne&s;s, nor from force or con&s;traint, but an acting of free choice; Nothing doth force the Phari&s;ees to &s;peak again&s;t and per&s;ecute Chri&s;t.

<P N="4">4. It is done <HI>Maliciou&s;ly</HI>; &s;o as it pro|ceeds not &s;o much, if at all, from a temptation to plea&s;ure, profit, or honour; It proceedeth not from fear, or force, or from any good end propo&s;ed; but out of heart-malice again&s;t God and Chri&s;t, and the advancement of His Glo|ry and Kingdom. So that it is of the very nature of Satans &s;in, who hath an irreconcileable hatred again&s;t God, and the remedy of Sin, becau&s;e his Glory is thereby advanced: This is a &s;pecial ingredient in this Sin. The Phari&s;ees are found guilty of heart-malice again&s;t Chri&s;t, &s;ince they &s;peak &s;o again&s;t Him, and not again&s;t their own Children ca&s;t|ing out Devils; and this is the force of Chri&s;ts argument, <HI>Mat.</HI> 12.27.

<P N="5">5. It is done <HI>De&s;pightfully.</HI> The malice mu&s;t bewray it &s;elf. The Phari&s;ees mu&s;t proclaim that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> hath corre&s;pondence

with Devils, <HI>Mat.</HI> 12. He mu&s;t be put to an open &s;hame, and Crucified again, <HI>Heb.</HI> 6. They mu&s;t tread under foot that Blood, and do de&s;pight to the Spirit, <HI>Heb</HI> 10.29. So that the party had rather peri&s;h a thou&s;and times, than be in <HI>Chri&s;ts</HI> debt for Salvation. The la&s;t thing in the de&s;cription, is, the ordinary atten|dant or con&s;equence of this &s;in: <HI>It breed|eth de&s;perate and hopele&s;s Fear.</HI> They fear Him, whom they hate with a &s;lavi&s;h hopele&s;s fear, &s;uch as Devils have <HI>Heb.</HI> 10.27.

<P>This al&s;o may have its own weight, as an argument to pre&s;s this way of Cove|nanting with God.

<HEAD>The whole TREATISE re&s;umed in a few <HI>Que&s;tions</HI> and <HI>An&s;wers.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Que&s;t. 1. <HI>WHAT is the great bu&s;ine&s;s a man hath to do in the world?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> To make &s;ure a Saving Intere&s;t in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and to walk &s;uitably thereunto.</P>
<P>Que&s;t&middot; 2. <HI>Have not all the Members of the vi&s;ible Church a Saving Intere&s;t in Chri&s;t?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> No verily; yea, but a very few of them have it.</P>
<P>Que&s;t 3. <HI>How &s;hall I know if I have a Sa|ving interest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n Him?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> Ordinarily the Lord prepareth His own way in the Soul, by a work of Hu|miliation, and di&s;covereth a mans &s;in &amp; mi&s;ery to him, and exerci&s;eth him &s;o therewith, that he longs for the Phy&s;i|cian Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</P>
<P>Que&s;t. 4. <HI>How &s;hall I know if I have got a competent di&s;covery of my &s;in and mi&s;ery?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> A competent &s;ight of it, maketh a man take Salvation to heart above any thing in this world: It maketh him di&s;|claim

all relief in him&s;elf, even in his be&s;t things: It maketh Chri&s;t, who is the Redeemer, very precious to the Soul: It maketh a man &s;tand in awe to &s;in afterwards, maketh him content to be &s;aved upon any terms God plea&s;eth.</P>
<P>Que&s;t. 5. <HI>What other way may I di&s;cern a Saving intere&s;t in Him?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> By the going out of my heart &s;e|riou&s;ly &amp; affectionately towards Him, as He is held out in the Go&s;pel, and this is Faith or Believing.</P>
<P>Que&s;t. 6. <HI>How &s;hall I know if my heart goeth out after Him aright, and that my Faith is true Saving Faith?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> Where the heart goeth out aright after Him, in true and &s;aving Faith, the Soul plea&s;eth Chri&s;t alone above all things, &amp; plea&s;eth Him in all His three Offices, to rule and in&s;truct as well as to &s;ave; and is content to cleave unto Him, what&s;oever inconvenience may follow.</P>
<P>Que&s;t. 7. <HI>What other marks of a Saving intere&s;t in Chri&s;t can you give to me?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> He that is in Chri&s;t &s;avingly, is a New Creature, he is graciou&s;ly changed and renewed in &s;ome mea&s;ure in the whole man, &amp; in all his wayes; point|ing

towards all the known Commands of God.</P>
<P>Que&s;t. 8. <HI>What if I find &s;in now and then prevail over me?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> Although every Sin de&s;erveth everla&s;ting vengeance, yet if thou be afflicted for your failings, confe&s;s them with &s;hame of face unto God, re&s;ol|ving to &s;trive again&s;t them hone&s;tly henceforth, and flee unto Chri&s;t for Pardon, you obtain mercy, and intere&s;t &s;tands &s;ure.</P>
<P>Que&s;t. 9. <HI>What &s;hall the man do who can|not lay claim to Chri&s;t Je&s;us, nor any of tho&s;e marks &s;poken of?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> Let him not take re&s;t, until he make &s;ure unto him&s;elf a Saving intere&s;t in Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Que&s;t 10. <HI>What way can a man make &s;ure an interest in Chri&s;t, who never had a Saving intere&s;t in Him hitherto?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> He mu&s;t take his Sins to heart, &amp; his great hazard thereby, and he mu&s;t take to heart Gods offer of Pardon and Peace through Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and hearti|ly clo&s;e with Gods offer, by betaking him&s;elf unto Chri&s;t, the ble&s;&s;ed refuge.</P>
<P>Que&s;t. 11. <HI>What if my &s;ins be &s;ingularly hei|nous and great beyond ordinary?</HI></P>

<P>Que&s;t 14. <HI>What may &s;hall I do that?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> Set apart &s;ame bit of time, and having con&s;idered your own lo&s;t e&s;tate, and the relief offered by Chri&s;t Je&s;us, work up your heart to plea&s;e and clo&s;e with that offer, and &s;ay unto God expre&s;ly, that you do accept of that offer, and of Him to be your God in Chri&s;t; and do give up your &s;elf to be &s;aved in His way, without re&s;ervation or exception in any ca&s;e; and that you

henceforth will wait for Salvation in the way He hath appointed.</P>
<P>Que&s;t. 15. <HI>What if I break unto God after|wards?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> You mu&s;t re&s;olve on His &s;trength not to break, &amp; watch over your own way, and put your heart in His hand to keep it: And if you break, you mu&s;t confe&s;s it unto God, and judge your &s;elf for it, and flee to the Advocate for Pardon, and re&s;olve to do no more &s;o: and this you mu&s;t do as often as you fail.</P>
<P>Que&s;t. 16. <HI>How &s;hall I come to full a&s;&s;u|rance of my intere&s;t in Christ, &s;o as it may be above controver&s;ie?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> Learn to lay your weight upon the Blood of Chri&s;t, and &s;tudy Purity and Holine&s;s in all manner of Conver&s;ation, and Pray for the witne&s;s of Gods Spi|rit, to joyn with the Bloud and the Water; and His Te&s;timony added un|to the&s;e, will e&s;tabli&s;h you in the Faith of an intere&s;t in CHRIST.</P>

<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> Union and Communion with God, all good here, and His Ble&s;&s;ed fellow|&s;hip
