<BIBL>PSALM cxix. 116.</BIBL>
<Q>&mdash;<HI>Let me not be a&s;hamed of my Hope.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AS <HI>Hope</HI> and <HI>Fear,</HI> are the two governing Pa&s;a &s;ions of the Soul; which excite us to Action: &s;o it is of Concern to us, to know how to improve them &s;o as to promote our Happine&s;s. And as we &s;hould im|prove our Fears of the Wrath of God and eternal Tor|ment, &s;o as to quicken us to flee from the Wrath to come, and to fly to the Refuge to lay hold on the Hope &s;et before us in Chri&s;t Je&s;us; So we &s;hould u&s;e our Hope, with a View to this great End.</P>
<P>It is greatly to be feared, that many have &s;uch a &s;lender and &s;andy Foundation of their Hope, that when they &s;hall expect, that they are ju&s;t entring into the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and Enjoyment of what they hoped for; they &s;hall find them&s;elves mi&s;taken and di&s;appointed: which is what the P&s;almi&s;t deprecates in our <HI>Text.</HI></P>
<P>Altho' he may, in this, have &s;ome Reference to his Hopes of outward good Things agreable to the Pro|mi&s;e of God to him; yet it appears to me, that he has Re&s;pect e&s;pecially to future and eternal Things in this pathetick Prayer; (<HI>Let me not be a&s;hamed of my Hope.</HI>)</P>
<P>We are not to expect to find a Connection of one Part with another, in this admirable P&s;alm; and there|fore I &s;hall con&s;ider the Words in an ab&s;tracted View: as a Prayer of holy <HI>David,</HI> (who was doubtle&s;s the Compo&s;er of this P&s;alm, under the Influence and In|&s;piration of the Holy Gho&s;t.)</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="005029_0004_100E689069B63518">And as this Prayer implies the Danger of our being deceived as to our Hopes of Happine&s;s and Salvation hereafter; &s;o it &s;hews us the great Nece&s;&s;ity there is of our having our <HI>Hopes</HI> of future Happine&s;s &s;o well grounded, that they may not <HI>make us a&s;hamed,</HI> as the Apo&s;tle expre&s;&s;es it, in Rom. 5. 5. or as in the Text, that we may <HI>not be a&s;hamed of our Hope</HI>: both of which may be con&s;idered (by divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance) under this Doctrine, which I think is very plain from the Words, viz.</P>
<P><HI>DOCT.</HI> It highly becomes every one of us, to labour and pray, that our Hopes of Happine&s;s and Salva|tion in the World to come may be built on &s;uch Foundations that we may not be a&s;ham'd thereof.</P>
<P>All Men in general (I believe) cheri&s;h &s;ome Hopes that they &s;hall be happy, or at lea&s;t not mi&s;erable, af|ter Death; whether they have any Foundation for &s;uch Hopes or no: the mo&s;t profligate Sinners flat|ter them&s;elves that God will be merciful to them; but how few are there that lay a good Foundation for their Hopes! and how few that frequently and carefully enough examine the Grounds and Foun|dations of their Hopes of Happine&s;s!</P>
<P>It is certain that as the Hope of true Believers &s;hall not make them a&s;hamed, &s;o there is the <HI>Hope of the Hypocrite</HI> which &s;hall peri&s;h. Job 8. 13, 14.&mdash;And <HI>the Hypocrite's Hope &s;hall peri&s;h; who&s;e Hope &s;hall be cut off; and who&s;e Tru&s;t &s;hall be as the Spider's Web.</HI></P>
<P>Hence in as much as our eternal Happine&s;s is &s;o nearly concerned in it, it appears to be of the high|e&s;t Importance to us, to &s;ee to it that the Hope we have of eternal Life; be not that of the Hypocrite; but a &s;ure well grounded Hope, of which we &s;hall never be a&s;hamed.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved here, that a Per&s;on may be &s;aid (in the Sen&s;e of our Text) to be <HI>a&s;hamed of his
<PB N="7" REF="005029_0005_100E6891EAC92FA0">
Hope when he is di&s;appointed or fru&s;trated of the Enjoy|ment of tho&s;e Things which he Hopes for.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hope has Reference to Things to come</HI>: what we po&s;|&s;e&s;s and enjoy we don't hope for: and as he that comes to enjoy all which he hoped for can't be &s;aid to be <HI>a&s;hamed of his Hope</HI>; &s;o Shame and Confu&s;ion will cover them, who, in&s;tead of the good Things they hoped for, &s;hall find them&s;elves fru&s;trated and di&s;appointed; and made mi&s;erable. This with Re|&s;pect to future and eternal Things will be mo&s;t a|mazing: How dreadful will it be for a Per&s;on to die. full of Hopes of the Joys and Glories of Heaven and to find in&s;tead thereof that he is &s;ent down to the Place of Torment!</P>
<P>What I further propo&s;e, for the Proof and Illu&s;|tration of this Doctrine is; to con&s;ider and &s;how;</P>
<P><HI>1.</HI> What that Hope of Salvation, is, which is good and well grounded, and &s;o will not make &s;uch as have it, a|&s;hamed: and what that Hope is which will make &s;uch as re&s;t in it a&s;hamed. <HI>And 2.</HI> to offer &s;ome Con&s;iderati|ons for the Proof of the <HI>Doctrine,</HI> and to convince us, of the Nece&s;&s;ity of our &s;triving and praying, that we may all have an Hope of Salvation which we &s;hall not be a|&s;hamed of.</P>
<P>And as the&s;e Things are of great Importance. I hope I &s;hall have your &s;erious and diligent Atten|tion, to what (by divine Help) I &s;hall offer.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t I am to con&s;ider, <HI>What that Hope of Sal|vation is, which is good and well grounded, and &s;o will not make: tho&s;e that have it, a&s;hamed: And what that Hope is which will make &s;uch as re&s;t in it a&s;hamed.</HI> And I &s;hall endeavour &s;o, to de&s;cribe the&s;e, as that we may be the better able to di&s;tingui&s;h between a true and fal&s;e Hope of Happine&s;s hereafter.</P>
<P>And that I may be the more ea&s;ily under&s;tood, I &s;hall con&s;ider the&s;e Things di&s;tinctly and apart, by
<PB N="8" REF="005029_0006_100E68939B0D8D68">
which they will mutually reflect Light on each o|ther. Agreeably I would con&s;ider fir&s;t, <HI>What a good and well-grounded Hope of Salvation is, which will not make &s;uch as have it a&s;hamed.</HI> And then &s;econdly, <HI>Confider what that fal&s;e Hope is, which &s;uch as re&s;t in it, &s;hall be a&s;hamed of.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I am to con&s;ider and &s;how what that good and well-grounded Hope of eternal Happine&s;s and Salvation is; which will not make &s;uch as have it a&s;hamed: be|cau&s;e it will not deceive them at la&s;t; but they &s;hall certainly enjoy the glorious and ble&s;&s;ed Things, which they hope for.</P>
<P><HI>Hope</HI> in general; <HI>is an Expectation, hereafter to po&s;|&s;e&s;s and enjoy &s;omething which we e&s;teem good, and think will tend to our Happine&s;s; and &s;o de&s;ire it and &s;uppo&s;e upon proper Endeavours, we may obtain it.</HI> This is a general De&s;cription of Hope. We don't hope for what we now enjoy; nor for any Thing which is not in our E&s;teem Good; nor for what we think, it is impo&s;&s;ible we &s;hould ever obtain. For altho' we might with for a good Thing which we are &s;en|&s;ible cannot be obtain'd. Yet we can't be faid pro|perly to hope for it. And if our Endeavours to ob|tain what we de&s;ire and hope for, are not included in Hope, yet they are excited by it.</P>
<P>Now the Hope intended in my Text (as I under|&s;tand it) and which I am now to con&s;ider; is&mdash;the Hope that we &s;hall hereafter enjoy, all tho&s;e glori|ous Things which <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> has purcha&s;ed; and <HI>God</HI> has in the Covenant of Grace mercifully promi&s;ed to his <HI>cho&s;en</HI> People; even the Favour of <HI>God,</HI> and the full Vi&s;ion and Enjoyment of him; and &s;o com|pleat and everla&s;ting Happine&s;s and Glory, Or a firm Expectation that we per&s;onally &s;hall be brought in the World to come (being conformed to the I|mage of God) to partake of that Fulne&s;s of Joys
<PB N="9" REF="005029_0007_100E689622570FB8">
which is in his Pre&s;ence, and tho&s;e Rivers of Plea|&s;ures which flow at his right Hand for evermore. And to flatter our &s;elves with &s;uch an Hope and Expectation, and after all, to find our&s;elves di&s;ap|pointed, is a Thought which may ju&s;tly fill us with Concern of Soul.</P>
<P>Now that I may be the better under&s;tood, I would ob&s;erve that even &s;uch as are not yet converted and brought into Chri&s;t; e&s;pecially if they are under Convictions, may &s;o far have Hope of this great Happine&s;s; that if they are now up and doing work|ing out their own Salvation with Fear and Trem|bling, if they con&s;cienciou&s;ly and diligently attend and improve all the Means of Grace which God has appointed, cheri&s;h their Convictions, &amp; &s;trive with all their Might: and &s;o wait on God. I &s;ay if they do &s;o, they may hope that God will, of his rich and free Grace, through Chri&s;t, work his whole Work in them and the Work of Faith with Power; that he will give them a true &s;aving Faith in Chri&s;t, and un&s;eigned Repentance of Sin; that he will convert them and that they &s;hall upon their Repentance and clo&s;ing with Chri&s;t, become in titled to eternal Life and Salvation, and as this &s;hould &s;upport &s;uch and keep them from De&s;pair; &s;o it ought to excite them to the mo&s;t diligent &s;eeking and &s;triving to obtain Grace and Mercy.</P>
<P>But the Believer has an Hope different from this. He hopes that God has already of his rich and free Grace, thro' Chri&s;t and by his Holy Spirit, wrought in his Heart tho&s;e Things upon which he is now become intitled to all the&s;e glorious Things, that he is become a <HI>Child of God</HI> and &s;o an <HI>Heir of God and joint Heir with Chri&s;t to that Inheritance which fades not away,</HI> Rom. 8. 17.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="005029_0008_100E6898A6FA5908">But in as much as &s;ome that do thus hope they are in the Way to eternal Life may be deceived, it may be proper to con&s;ider the Foundation on which our Hopes of Happine&s;s hereafter mu&s;t be laid, &s;o that it may be &s;ure and <HI>not make us a&s;hamed</HI>: with &s;ome of the Fruits and Properties of it.</P>
<P>And here, I would &s;ay, the Grace, Mercy and Goodne&s;s of God, is the fir&s;t Foundation of our Hope of Happine&s;s in the World to come, from this Originates our Hope of Salvation. The whole of that glorious Contrivance of the Salvation of Sinners ari&s;es and flows from the Mercy of God; which moved him to compa&s;&s;ionate our Mi&s;ery, and &s;at his infinite Wi&s;dom on Work, to contrive and bring a|bout a Method, (every Way agreeable to his adora|ble Excellencies, Perfections and Attributes) for our Salvation.</P>
<P>Indeed it is of the free, rich Grace and Mercy of God that we are &s;aved. Every Thing that is done by God in Order to our Salvation: and Salvation it&s;elf flows from free Grace. Eph. 2.8. <HI>By Grace are ye &s;aved through Faith, and that not of your&s;elves it is the Gift of God.</HI> But then it would neverthele&s;s be un&s;afe to hope for eternal Life, meerly becau&s;e, God is merciful, they that are in eternal Mi&s;ery will never be happy although God is a Being of infinite; Mercy, no! he is inexorable to all their Crys and Lamentations. We may by no Means depend on the uncovenanted Mercy of God.</P>
<P>If ever we obtain &s;aving Grace and Mercy it mu&s;t be in God's own Way, in that Method in which all his divine Attributes and Perfections will be glorified and which is revealed to us in the Go&s;pel, in which Life and Immortality are brought to Light.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="005029_0009_100E689A28E836B8">And this is only in and by our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t and in the Covenant of Grace, and &s;o agreeable to the Promi&s;es of God in the Covenant, which are in Chri&s;t Yea and Amen. Although God be infinitely merciful, although he be in and through Chri&s;t the Father of Mercies and God of all Grace and Con&s;o|lation, and in him is reconciling the World to him|&s;elf; yet out of Chri&s;t he is a con&s;uming Fire, and will by no Means clear the Guilty, and it is in vain for us, to hope to obtain Mercy unle&s;s we &s;eek it in that Way in which alone God is plea&s;ed to be|&s;tow it, and therefore it appears, that it is the Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, it is his Obedience, Sufferings, and Interce&s;&s;ion, that is the Foundation on which we mu&s;t build our Hopes of obtaining the Mercy of God to everla&s;ting Life; and this al&s;o in the Way of the Covenant of Grace, and agreeable to the mo&s;t gracious Promi&s;es in it.</P>
<P>And then further the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t mu&s;t be made our own, that is it mu&s;t be imputed to us, and we mu&s;t be made Partakers of his Bene|fits, by the Application of them to us by the Holy Spirit, in Order to our Ju&s;tification and Salvation; And we mu&s;t become intitled to the Mercies pro|mi&s;ed in the Covenant. For although there is a full and happy Provi&s;ion made for Sinners in Chri&s;t, al|though there be a Covenant of Grace made with Believers in him, and exceeding great and precious. Promi&s;es; yet if we never come to Chri&s;t, and em|brace him by Faith &s;o as to be united to him; if we don't acquie&s;ee in the Way of Salvation by him, and receive him on his own Terms: If we don't come into the Covenant of Grace, and lay hold on the Promi&s;es. What Benefit and Advantage will all this be of to us? <HI>He that believeth not &s;hall be damned,</HI> Mark 16. 16. If Chri&s;t be the chief of ten
<PB N="12" REF="005029_0010_100E689CAF0FAB20">
Thou&s;and and altogether lovely; yet if we can't &s;ay with the Spou&s;e, Cant. 2. 16. <HI>My Beloved, is mine and I am his.</HI> How &s;hall we be the better for him? Although there be Merit enough in Chri&s;t for the Salvation of all that will come to him; yet can we expect to partake of his Merits, and Benefits, unle&s;s we come to him in his own Way therefor?</P>
<P>Still further, however gracious God is, whatever Provi&s;ion is made for us in Chri&s;t, and in the Cove|nant; yet &s;ince <HI>no unholy Thing can enter into Heaven</HI> Rev. 21. 27. And <HI>without Holine&s;s no Man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord,</HI> Heb. 12. 14. It will follow hence that we, who are by Nature unholy, impure, and defiled, and Children of Wrath; mu&s;t be converted, changed, renewed and &s;anctified, in Order to our obtaining that Heaven of Happine&s;s, which we hope for: And in Order to our being renewed and &s;anctified by the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit, (who is God that &s;anctifies us) we mu&s;t be, (by the &s;ame Holy Spirit,) enlightned in the Things of God, convinced of the evil and ac|cur&s;ed Nature of Sin, as it is again&s;t the Nature, Attributes and Perfections of God, and a Violation of his Law, and a dreadful Abu&s;e of his unequalled Mercy and Grace, many Ways di&s;covered to us; but e&s;pecially in giving us &s;uch a glorious Saviour: And al&s;o of our own per&s;onal Guilt, that we our&s;elves are the very Per&s;ons who are guilty. And we mu&s;t be brought to a real un&s;eigned Hatred of all and e|very Sin, con&s;idered as Sin; and to a real Conver&s;ion or turning from Sin unto God.</P>
<P>Agreeably, having ob&s;erved the&s;e Things, I may proceed to &s;ay, in order to lay the Foundation of our Hope of future Happine&s;s and Salvation, deep and &s;ure, and to have &s;uch an <HI>Hope as we &s;hall not be a&s;hamed of.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="005029_0011_100E68A0427C94D8">We mu&s;t come to be well &s;atisfied and a&s;&s;ured, that we have been enabled to comply with the Terms on which Salvation is promi&s;ed. In a few Words, here, more particularly,</P>
<P>They that have a good and well grounded Hope, that they are now Heirs to Glory; are &s;uch as have good Rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied, that they have been tru|ly and really convinced of Sin; and been brought to an hearty Sorrow for it, that they have in them a real Hatred of all Sin, as Sin, that they have truly repented of all and every Sin and that a real Change is wrought in them, that they are <HI>turned from Dark|ne&s;s to Light, and from the Power of Satan to the living God.</HI> That <HI>old Things are pa&s;&s;eed away</HI> in them and <HI>all Things are become new,</HI> that they are <HI>born again</HI> and <HI>created a new in Chri&s;t Je&s;us unto good Works which God ordain'd that they &s;hould walk in them.</HI> And that they have been enabled, by the Grace and Spirit of God (in Concurrance with their Endeavours) to clo&s;e with Chri&s;t on his own Terms; to come intirely out of them&s;elves, renouncing all Dependance on their own Righteou&s;ne&s;s, or any Thing that they can po&s;|&s;ibly do to receive Chri&s;t as their Prophet, Prie&s;t and King, as their <HI>Lord</HI> as well as <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>; and &s;o to put over all the Concerns of their precious and immor|tal Souls into his Hands. And <HI>that their Hearts are purified by Faith</HI> and their <HI>Faith works by Love.</HI></P>
<P>Whoever has a well-grounded. A&s;&s;urance of this, that the&s;e Things are wrought in and for him; has a good and &s;ure Hope of eternal Life and Salvation, he may lay hold on the Promi&s;es, (being united to Chri&s;t) and re&s;t &s;atisfied in the never-failing Faith|fulne&s;s of him that has promi&s;ed: and &s;o may go on his Way rejoicing. If our Hope be indeed built on the&s;e Principles, on this Foundation, we &s;hall never be a&s;hamed of it,</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="005029_0012_100E68A1C39A2E20">But that I may be as plain as po&s;&s;ible, and that you may the better judge whether the Hope you now have be indeed well grounded. Con&s;ider whether you find in you, the Fruits and Con&s;equents, and the di&s;tingiu&s;hing Properties of &s;uch an Hope, or tho&s;e Things that accompany it; &s;uch as the&s;e.</P>
<P>Do you upon a &s;erious and clo&s;e Examination, find that the Bent, Bia&s;s and Inclination of your Souls, and Minds are to God to Religion and Holine&s;s? Do you take Plea&s;ure in Meditating on God, his Di|vine Perfections and on his Word, and in Commu|nion with him? Do you love his Hou&s;e, Wor&s;hip, Ordinances, and his Mini&s;ters for their Work Sake; and the Image of God, and &s;uch as bear his Image? <HI>We know we are pa&s;&s;ed from Death to Life becau&s;e we love the Brethren,</HI> 1 John 3. 14.</P>
<P>And do you find that you have in you a true habi|tual Hatred of Sin and of all Sin? Is there no darl|ing Sin which you hug in your Bo&s;oms, and &s;ecretly role as a &s;weet Mor&s;el under your Tongue?</P>
<P>Again do your Hopes of Happine&s;s make &amp; keep you meek, humble, and lowly in Mind, &s;o that in Meekne&s;s and Lowline&s;s of Mind, you e&s;teem others better than your &s;elves? They that have a good Hope will have this Temper of Mind, <HI>Meekne&s;&s;, Love, Gentlene&s;s,</HI> and <HI>Goodnefs,</HI> are reckoned up a|mong the genuine <HI>Fruits of the Spirit</HI> that dwells in Believers, Gal. 5. 22. We &s;hall have great Rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect the Foundation of our Hope, if our Hope puffs us up, makes us proud, &s;elf-conceited and cen|&s;orious. Of which more hereafter.</P>
<P>Further, are you willing and de&s;irous to come to the Light, and to have the Foundation of your Hope thro'ly &s;earch'd &amp; try'd? It is a very dark Sign, if we are backward and loath to tru&s;t the Foundation of our Hope to Examination, that we our &s;elves &s;u&s;pect that
<PB N="15" REF="005029_0013_100E68A4474367D0">
it is not good, and yet are too willing to be deceived. Our Saviour &s;ays John 3. 20, 21. <HI>For every one that doth Evil hateth the Light, neither cometh to the Light lea&s;t his Deeds &s;hould be reproved. But he that doth Truth cometh to the Light, that his Deeds may be made manife&s;t that they are wrought in God.</HI> We &s;hould con&s;ider therefore whether it be our hearty De&s;ire and Prayer, that God would di&s;cover us to our&s;elves, and give us to know our true State and Condition, whatever Un|ea&s;ine&s;s the Knowledge of it might now give us. Can we heartily pray as in 26 P&s;al. 2. <HI>Examine me, O Lord, and prove me, try my Reins and my Heart.</HI> And 139th P&s;alm 23, 24. <HI>Search' me, O God, and know my Heart, try me and know my Thoughts, and &s;ee if there be any wicked Way in me, and lead me in the Way ever|la&s;ting.</HI></P>
<P>Let me add, do you find that the more you &s;earch your&s;elves and try the Grounds of your Hope, the better you are &s;atisfied that your Hope is good? If &s;o this is a good Token that your Hope is laid on a good Bottom.</P>
<P>Still further, doth your Hope of Salvation quicken you, to clean&s;e and purify your&s;elves from all Sin, and Uncleanne&s;s, make you more earne&s;t in your En|deavours to be holy in Heart and Life? This is an e&s;&s;ential Property of a good Hope, 1 John 3.3. <HI>And every Man that hath this Hope in him purifieth him&s;elf e|ven as he is pure.</HI> If your Hope be a good and well-grounded Hope you will find that it will excite and &s;tir you up to labour and &s;trive to be more and more holy and pure, more religious and virtuous, to be more like God.</P>
<P>You will not then re&s;t in a bare &s;lender Hope but will be <HI>giving all Diligence to make your Calling and E|lection &s;ure.</HI> 2 Pet. 1. 10. They that think low De|grees of Grace eno', and that if they once come to

have &s;ome Hope of Happine&s;s it is &s;ufficient, or that they have already attained Grace enough to carry them to Heaven and &s;o are ea&s;y; have great Rea|&s;on to fear they have no Grace at all. Grace is of a growing Nature; Prov. 4. 18. <HI>The Path of the ju&s;t is as the &s;hining Light, that &s;hineth more and more unto the perfect Day.</HI> And every one that has a good Hope will find &s;ome &s;uch Temper in him as the Apo&s;tle ex|pre&s;&s;es in Phil. 3. 12. V and on, which read. They that have Grace will de&s;ire more and never think they have enough of it here.</P>
<P>I would ju&s;t add further here, doth your Hope of Salvation, make you rejoice more in Communion with God, and in the Manife&s;tations of his Favour, than in the outward Gifts of his Providence? This, the P&s;almi&s;t mentions 4th P&s;al. 6, 7. <HI>There be many that &s;ay, who will &s;hew us any Good? Lord, lift thou up the Light of thy Countenance upon us. Thou ha&s;t put Gladne&s;s in mine Heart, more than in the Time that their Corn and their Wine increa&s;ed.</HI> The clearer our Hopes and Views of heavenly Joys are, the le&s;s will our E|&s;teem of and Love to earthly Things be. And the clearer our Evidences are that we are converted and in the Way to Happine&s;s, the greater will be our Joy and Comfort. Our Comfort will ari&s;e in Proporti|on, to the Evidence we have that our Hopes are well-grounded.</P>
<P>It &s;hould be ob&s;erved here, that &s;uch as have in|deed a good Hope, may &s;ometimes be under Clouds and Darkne&s;s, they that <HI>fear the Lord and obey the Voice of his Servant</HI> may be left to <HI>walk in Darkne&s;s and &s;ee no Light,</HI> 50th I&s;ai. 10. And <HI>the Comforter that &s;hould relieve their Souls</HI> may be <HI>far from them,</HI> Lam. 1. 16. And this may ari&s;e &s;ometimes partly from bodily Indi&s;po&s;itions; more commonly from the Carele&s;&s;ne&s;s of &s;uch, they being off their Guard, and
<PB N="17" REF="005029_0015_100E68A89F4F1F18">
&s;o expo&s;ed to and overcome by Temptations: And falling into &s;ome Sins which grieve the Holy Gho&s;t and cau&s;e their <HI>Beloved to withdraw,</HI> Cant. 5. 2.&mdash;A|gain, this may ari&s;e in &s;ome, partly from comparing their Experiences and Grounds of Hope, more with tho&s;e of others; than with the Rules in the Word of God. If Per&s;ons don't find in them&s;elves tho&s;e Things which &s;ome others tell them they have expe|rienced; although upon a full Examination they may have as good Rea&s;on of their Hope; yet this may cau&s;e Doubts to ari&s;e even in the Heart of a Believer. And it mu&s;t be &s;aid we need the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Holy Gho&s;t, in examining the Grounds of our Hope, and to enable us to &s;ee our true State, and to <HI>witne&s;s with our Spirit that we are the Children of God,</HI> Rom. 18.17. And we &s;hall not clearly &s;ee the Foundation (which may be laid in us) to hope for Happine&s;s, without the Help of the Spirit, &s;o as to have <HI>no Doubts</HI>; but if after all, in your dark Hours, you find your <HI>Hearts wake</HI> like the Spou&s;e's forementioned Cant. 5. 2. And your <HI>Hope is as the Anchor of your Souls</HI>: Which &s;up|ports and bears you up under all your Di&s;tre&s;&s;es and Difficulties, and you have the Witne&s;s of your own Spirits, that your Hope is built on the Foundation I have above mentioned, you may be &s;atisfied it is a good Hope.</P>
<P>There are other Marks in Scripture (agreeable to the&s;e) by which you may try the Foundation of your Hope; but I believe if you carefully and impartial|ly and frequently examine your&s;elves by what has been &s;aid, you may come to a &s;atisfactory Conclu&s;ion, whether you have &s;uch an Hope as will not make you <HI>a&s;hamed</HI> or not.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only add, if we could be fully &s;atisfied in this important Point, we mu&s;t be frequent, &s;erious and impartial in our Self-Examination and in com|paring
<PB N="18" REF="005029_0016_100E68AB23303978">
our&s;elves with the Marks of true Believers; we mu&s;t be con&s;tant in the U&s;e of Means ; and we mu&s;t be much in Prayer to God, to a&s;&s;i&s;t us herein, and to di&s;cover to us what Foundation of Hope we have ; and to give us the Te&s;timony of his Spirit with ours, that we are his Children, and have a good Hope, and if we obtain this, we &s;hall have <HI>Joy un|&s;peakable, and full of Glory.</HI> But this will receive fur|ther Light from the Con&s;ideration of that Hope which will make &s;uch as have it a&s;hamed. To which I now (as I propo&s;ed) proceed.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, I am to con&s;ider, <HI>What that ill-grounded and fal&s;e Hope is, of which, &s;uch as have it, &s;hall be a&s;ha|med, and &s;ome of the Properties of it.</HI></P>
<P>And this being contrary to this good Hope, you may very much judge what it is, by what has been already &s;aid, for they illu&s;trate each other. So that I need but little more than repeat &s;ome Things which have been already mentioned; and &s;how that that Hope which is founded on Things contrary thereto, or very different therefrom is a fal&s;e Hope and with|out good Grounds.</P>
<P>It is an awful and awakening Con&s;ideration, that &s;o many hope for Happine&s;s without any good Ground and Foundation. Their Hope is no better than a vain Pre&s;umption. And if &s;uch could &s;ee what their Condition really is, and how groundle&s;s their Hope, now; as they will (if not before) when it will be forever too late to rectify the dreadful Mi|&s;take: It might &s;erve to excite them to endeavour after a better Hope. That many do deceive them|&s;elves with a vain Hope is very plain from what I have before &s;aid, and from Job 11. 20. <HI>But the Eyes of the wicked &s;hall fail, &amp; they &s;hall not e&s;cape &amp; their Hope &s;hall be as the giving up of the Gho&s;t.</HI> And Job 18.14. <HI>His Confidence &s;hall be rooted out of his Tabernacle, and it

&s;hall bring him to the King of Terrors.</HI> 27 Chap. 8 v. <HI>For what is the Hope of the Hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his Soul</HI>? It is &s;uppo&s;ed here (you &s;ee) that Per&s;ons may have an Hope of Happine&s;s and yet peri&s;h, and oh how dreadful will this be! Let this Con&s;ideration awaken your Atten|tion to what may be &s;aid in &s;howing what a fal&s;e Hope is, and excite you to &s;ee to it that you be not deceived by &s;uch an Hope. And that you may be the better able to judge whether your Hopes of Hap|pine&s;s be not built on &s;ome fal&s;e Foundation: I &s;hall offer a few Things under this Head to your &s;erious Con&s;ideration. Such as</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, <HI>If our Hope of Happine&s;s is built on the Mercy of God, con&s;ider'd &s;eparately from the Merits of Chri&s;t and the Covenant of Grace it is a fal&s;e Hope.</HI></P>
<P>It is to be feared that too many hope to be happy hereafter, only becau&s;e, they think God is merciful and gracious; all the Foundation of their Hope is the <HI>uncovenanted Mercy</HI> of God. But this is no good Foundation; for altho'our Hopes of Happine&s;s are founded on the Mercy and Grace of God, yet (as I have before &s;hown) it is thro' the Merits of Chri&s;t, and in the Way of the Covenant of Grace. It is thro' Chri&s;t and in Covenant that we may hope for eternal Mercy. It is pre&s;umption to hope for Salvation without Chri&s;t, and unle&s;s we receive it in the Chan|nel of the Covenant and Promi&s;es of God in it. To hope for Mercy, therefore, without any Con&s;idera|tion of Chri&s;t, the Covenant of Grace and the Pro|mi&s;es, is to hope without good Grounds.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, <HI>Our Hope of Salvation, while we have, no Rea&s;on to think we have an Intere&s;t in Chri&s;t, that we are in the Covenant of Grace, and &s;o intitled to the Pro|mi&s;es of Salvation and Happine&s;s; is without a good Foundation.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="005029_0018_100E68AF8E94BA20">The Mercy of God, the Merits of Chri&s;t, and the exceeding great and precious Promi&s;es of the Go&s;pel, will be of no further Advantage to us than we be|come intere&s;ted therein.</P>
<P>I am afraid many build their Hope of Heaven and Happine&s;s upon this, that there is Mercy in God, Merits enough in Chri&s;t, and many gracious Promi|&s;es in the Word of God; but never carefully enough examine to &s;ee, whether they them&s;elves, have com|ply'd with tho&s;e Terms upon which they become in|titled to any of them. They don't (as they &s;hould do) carefully and throughly enough examine, whe|ther they have intirely come out of them&s;elves and renounc'd all Dependance on them&s;elves, and emp|tied them&s;elves of all Confidence, in their own Me|rits, or Righteou&s;ne&s;s, whether they don't depend on their Faith (as a Work by which they merit) or their Repentance or Morality; And whether they have with their whole Heart embraced the Lord Je|&s;us Chri&s;t in all his Offices, as their Prophet, Priests, and King, as their whole and alone Saviour. And yet whether they have any good Rea&s;on to hope they have done the&s;e Things (by the Help of the Spirit) or no, they vainly flatter them&s;elves they are in the Way to be &s;aved by Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t (in Faithfulne&s;s) tell you, Brethren, that whatever other Foundation of Hope you may flat|ter your&s;elves you have; yet if you are &s;till Unbe|lievers, if you have never clo&s;ed with and embrac'd the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t on his own Terms, if you have never heartily laid hold on the Covenant of Grace and given up your&s;elves in it, and &s;o have not laid hold on the Promi&s;es by Faith; your Hope is not built on a good and &s;ure Foundation, and you may expect to be a&s;hamed of it at la&s;t.</P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>If you are not truly converted and born a|gain,
<PB N="21" REF="005029_0019_100E68B215A36DC0">
gain, if you are not become new Creatures, and yet hope you are now in the Way to Salvation, your Hope is vain and groundle&s;s.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Except a Man be born again, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God,</HI> &s;ays our Saviour, John 3.3. and the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e, 2 Cor. 5. 17. <HI>If any Man be in Chri&s;t Je&s;us be is anew Creature, old Things are done away in him, and behold all Things are be|become new.</HI> Now unle&s;s we find the&s;e Things in us what Grounds of Hope can we have? Every Change doth not lay a good Foundation of Hope. A Man may be very greatly changed in his outward Conver&s;ation, and experience &s;ome Change in his Heart; and yet never feel, never experience an u|niver&s;al Change in his Heart, Soul, andi whole Na|ture. A Per&s;on may be under very &s;trong Convicti|ons, and be brought to &s;ee Things, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure different from what he did before; and may have a con&s;iderable Change wrought in him: he may for|&s;ake many Sins, and comply with many Duties out|wardly; and yet all this while never have his Heart really changed, nor his Mind renewed He may not have any true Hatred of Sin, con&s;idered as Sin; for then he would hate all Sin. Nay he may have &s;ome joy and &s;eeming Plea&s;ure in Things of Religion. And what he may mi&s;take for the <HI>Joy of the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> and yet have no true, hearty Love to God, and our Saviour, nor perform any Duties from a Principle of Love to God, Hatred of Sin, Faith in Chrir&s;t, and Obedience to God. But this is no good Hope. It may be ju&s;t ob&s;erved here, that although Faith in Chri&s;t, and Repentance of Sin (which is in|cluded in this Conver&s;ion) be very different in their own Nature, yet they are never &s;eparated in a Per|&s;on; he that believes aright in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, repents of his Sins, and is converted: And &s;o on the
<PB N="22" REF="005029_0020_100E68B4AB939BF0">
contrary. And Repentance and this true real Change in our Hearts, (which will influence our Lives, of which hereafter) is nece&s;&s;ary to be found in us, in order to our having a good Hope of Salvation. With|out Conver&s;ion we can't be happy hereafter. I am &s;en&s;ible the Work of Sanctification will not be per|fected in this Life; but yet it mu&s;t be here begun; and you mu&s;t be &s;anctified (if not perfectly here) yet throughout, in every Part, Power, and Facul|ty of your Souls; you mu&s;t be <HI>wholly,</HI> that is in every part <HI>&s;anctified, and your whole Spirit, Soul, and Body</HI> mu&s;t be <HI>pre&s;erved blamele&s;s</HI> (in &s;ome Mea&s;ure) <HI>unto the Coming of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> 1 The&s;&s;. 5. 2, 3.</P>
<P N="4">4. Doth the Hope you have of Salvation and Happine&s;s make and keep you humble, meek and lowly? If not, you have Rea&s;on to fear it is no better than the Hope of an Hypocrite.</P>
<P>A true and well-grounded Hope, has always this Fruit and Effect that it humbles the Soul that has it, a good Foundation of Hope can't be in the &s;ame Soul, where Pride and Self-Conceit, e&s;pecially &s;piritual Pride is cheri&s;hed and reigns. He that has a good Hope will be ready in Meekne&s;s and Lowline&s;s of Mind to e&s;teem others better than him&s;elf: But a fal&s;e Hope, the Hope of an Hypocrite is apt to puff Men up with Pride, Vain-Glory, and Self-Conceit; they that have &s;uch an Hope, are apt to e&s;teem them&s;elves bet|ter than others; to proclaim their own Goodne&s;s, and to de&s;pi&s;e, judge and cen&s;ure others. Think not that I &s;peak this of my&s;elf without Authority, for faith not the Scripture the &s;ame Things, what le&s;s doth our Saviour teach us in the Account he gives us of &s;uch a Phari&s;ee in Luke 18. 10. and on, <HI>The Phari&s;ee &s;tood and prayed thus with him&s;elf, God I thank thee, that I am not as other Men are, Extortioners, Un|ju&s;t,

Adulterers or even as this Publican;</HI> How he boa&s;ts of him&s;elf and de&s;pi&s;es his Neighbour! <HI>Charity is not puffed up,</HI> 1 Cor. 13. 4. Nor doth it <HI>envy</HI> others nor <HI>vaunt it&s;elf.</HI> If your Knowledge and &s;piritual Expe|riences and Hope of Happine&s;s which you pretend to, make you proud, and to think highly of your|&s;elves, and meanly of others, and if they make you uncharitably to any; you have great Rea&s;on to fear yours is no better Hope and built on no better Foun|dation, than the Hope of this Phari&s;ee, and yet our Sa|viour tells us the Publican he &s;o much de&s;pi&s;ed was ju|&s;tified rather than he. The great God &s;peaking of &s;uch as &s;ay to others, <HI>Stand by thy&s;elf, come not near to me, for I am holier than thou,</HI> &s;ays, <HI>the&s;e are a Smoak in my No&s;e, a Fire that burneth all Day</HI>: And threatens to reward them accordingly, 65 I&s;ai. 5, 0.</P>
<P>Once more 5thly, <HI>If your Hope doth not purify you, and quicken you to do all you can to be free from all Sin, all Pollution both in Heart and Life; you have Rea&s;on to fear it is without Ground.</HI></P>
<P>If we would evidence to our&s;elves and others that our Hope of Salvation is built on a &s;ure Foundation, we mu&s;t do it by bringing forth <HI>Fruits, meet for Repen|tance.</HI> Matth. 3. 8. An unholy Heart and Life can't be con&s;i&s;tent with a good Hope.</P>
<P>A good Divine<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Mead.</NOTE> &s;ays, you may hope for Heaven, while you are doing the Work of Hell: you may hope for Salvation while you are working out your own Damnation; you may hope in God, and yet ne|ver choo&s;e him for your Portion. A good Hope pu|rifies the Heart (as you have heard) and will excite us to endeavour to have a <HI>pure Heart, and clean Hands.</HI> 24. P&s;al. 4. but a fal&s;e Hope is u&s;ed as a covering for Sin, Jer. 7. 8. and on.</P>
<P>If our Hopes of Happine&s;s are on a good Founda|tion, they will rai&s;e our Hearts and Affections, a|bove

the Things of this World. This World and the Things of it will appear vain and trifling in the Eyes of him who has a good Hope of the infinitely grea|ter and better Things of another. He that has this Hope will di&s;approve every Thing that tends to hin|der his Coming to enjoy what he hopes for, and ap|prove every Thing that may help him forward to the Enjoyment of the de&s;ired Good, but to enlarge no further (although more might be &s;aid here) I have endeavoured to &s;how you how you may in &s;ome good Mea&s;ure know, whether the Foundation which you build your Hopes of Salvation upon be good or no. And &s;o whether you &s;hall be likely to be a&s;hamed of your <HI>Hope</HI> or not. And I hope what has been &s;aid may be of Service to &s;atisfy you herein. And this may &s;uffice for the fir&s;t Thing I propo&s;ed to con&s;ider under the Doctrine. I proceed now to the &s;econd, Viz.</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>To offer &s;ome Con&s;iderations, for the Proof of the Doctrine, and to convince us, of the Nece&s;&s;ity of our &s;triving and praying that we may all have an Hope of Salvation, on &s;uch good Grounds, as that we &s;hall not be a&s;hamed of it.</HI></P>
<P>The P&s;almi&s;t without Doubt had as good and well grounded an Hope, as any of us have or can expect to have here; and yet you &s;ee, he (in the Text) prays to God that he might <HI>not be a&s;hamed of his Hope.</HI> And as he pray'd for this, &s;o, doubtle&s;s, he al&s;o en|deavour'd in the U&s;e of proper Means, to have his Hope &s;o well-grounded that he might not be a&s;ham|ed of it at Death, at the Judgment and in the coming World. The Doctrine then naturally ari&s;es from die Text.</P>
<P>And without Doubt it is of great Concern to us all, to labour, &s;trive, and pray; that we may have &s;uch
<PB N="25" REF="005029_0023_100E68BB8E5F94A8">
an Hope as &s;hall not make us a&s;hamed: as mo&s;t cer|tainly all &s;uch Hopes will, as are not laid on a good and &s;ure Foundation. The Text plainly &s;uppo&s;es an Hope that will be di&s;appointed. And the wi&s;e Man ob&s;erves, Prov. 10. 28. <HI>The Hope of the Righteous &s;hall be Gladne&s;s; but the Expectation of the Wicked &s;hall pe|ri&s;h.</HI> And if <HI>Hope deferred maketh the Heart &s;ick; but when, the De&s;ire cometh it is a Tree of Life</HI>? As Prov. 13. 12. How dreadful will be the Shame and Confu|&s;ion of tho&s;e who hope for Happine&s;s and Salvation after Death and yet &s;hall find them&s;elves di&s;ap|pointed!</P>
<P>But it may be proper, under this Head, to give &s;ome Rea&s;ons of the Doctrine, or Motives to ex|cite us to labour and pray for a good Hope, and &s;e|veral important Rea&s;ons may be briefly offered.</P>
<P>And be&s;ides what is &s;aid in our Text, and &s;uch o|ther Texts as &s;how this to be our Duty and Intere&s;t, I would further offer the following Things to Con&s;i|deration, &s;ome of which may excite our Fear, others our Hope, and Endeavours. Viz.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, <HI>We &s;hould labour and pray that we may have a good Hope, becau&s;e, if we don't, we &s;hall be in great Danger of having a fal&s;e and ill-grounded Hope which we &s;hall be a&s;hamed of.</HI></P>
<P>The Thoughts of eternal Torment, are &s;o &s;hock|ing: that few, if any, can bear them; hence mo&s;t, if not all Men, find &s;omething or other, as a Foun|dation of Hope to e&s;cape this; and it is greatly to be feared, that the greater Part of Mankind, have a bad Foundation of Hope. And even tho&s;e that en|joy the greate&s;t Priviledges and make the highe&s;t Profe&s;&s;ion of Religion, are in Danger of this; unle&s;s they with much Care and Prayer lay the Foundation: at fir&s;t, deep and &s;ure, and then al&s;o often &s;earch the Foundation, to &s;ee if it be indeed &s;uch as will not
<PB N="26" REF="005029_0024_100E68BE1072DC78">
fail. We read of &s;ome chat have <HI>made Shipwrack of Faith, and a good Con&s;cience.</HI> 1 Tim. 1. 19. And the very Po&s;&s;ibility of &s;uch a Thing, &s;hould quicken us to the greate&s;t Care that we be not like them. It is not &s;o ea&s;y a Matter to gain &s;uch a good Hope, as we &s;hall with for hereafter, as &s;ome may think it is, there are too many <HI>build this on the Sand,</HI> to allude to that of our Saviour, <HI>Matth.</HI> 7. 24. and on. There are many fal&s;e and un&s;afe Foun|dations on which Men build their Hopes: And we have Hearts in us naturally, which are <HI>deceitful above all Things and de&s;perately wicked.</HI> Jer. 17. 9. We have al&s;o a very &s;ubtle Devil, who without Doubt doth all he po&s;&s;ibly can, to prevent our laying a good Foun|dation of Hope, becau&s;e &s;o long as he can keep us from this, he has much Rea&s;on to think he &s;hall de|&s;troy us. He is very willing we &s;hould hope for Happine&s;s provided our Hope be on a fal&s;e Founda|tion.&mdash;Hence it appears, that unle&s;s we are very careful, diligent and prayerful, we &s;hall be in great Danger of a fal&s;e Hope. It requires much Study, much Meditation, and clo&s;e Examination to lay a good Foundation of Hope If you only reflect and con&s;ider what I have before mentioned as good Grounds of Hope, you will &s;ee, that unle&s;s we &s;trive labour and u&s;e all appointed Means, there will be no Rea&s;on to expect a good Bottom to build our Hopes upon, we mu&s;t believe, repent, be converted and born again, in order to our having good Rea&s;on to hope that we &s;hall partake of the &s;aving Grace and Mercy of God through Chri&s;t. And &s;urely if we will not labour to lay a good Foundation of Hope we can't expect it. And then we never can have a &s;ure and good Ground of Hope unle&s;s the Foundation be laid in us by the Holy Spirit, working the Work of God in us. Which &s;hews us the Nece&s;&s;ity of our
<PB N="27" REF="005029_0025_100E68BF9260A6A0">
praying to God for the Spirit. Let me add here, as there is Need of our Endeavours and Prayers in or|der to have a good Ground of Hope; &s;o there is al|&s;o, in order to our &s;eeing and knowing this that &s;o we may have the Comfort of it. <HI>We &s;hould give all Diligence to make our Calling and Election &s;ure.</HI> 2 Pet. 1. 10. And as we greatly need the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Spirit, in our Self-Examination, and to <HI>witne&s;s with our Spirits,</HI> &s;o we mu&s;t &s;eek him of God, if we would obtain &s;uch a Priviledge. We have no &s;ufficient Ground to expect to have a good Foundation of Hope, nor a comfortable Sen&s;e thereof; unle&s;s we labour and pray therefor. But I proceed to con&s;ider,</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>We &s;hould labour and pray that we may have a good and well-grounded Hope; becau&s;e of the great Di&s;advantages, and infinite Danger there is in having a fal&s;e Hope, which will make us a&s;hamed.</HI></P>
<P>There is not only Danger, that we &s;hall re&s;t in a fal&s;e Hope; but there is as much or more Danger of us, if it &s;hould be our unhappy Condition to build our Hopes on the Sand, and to &s;atisfy our&s;elves with an Hope that will deceive us.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome Per&s;ons, who never had any great Advantages to know any Thing of Religion, and the Way and Method of Salvation, by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, (which is the only Way:) and others although they have had the great Priviledges of the Go&s;pel; yet never had any Awakenings and Convictions; but the meer Convictions of natural Con&s;ciences, and this has been &s;o bribed and blinded by their prevail|ing Lu&s;ts and Temptations and the Deceitfulne&s;s of Sin; that they have never fixed on any Foundation of Hope, which, upon the lea&s;t Reflection and Exa|mination can be thought good. They may hope for Mercy on Account of this, they think God is graci|cious and merciful, and will not, did not make Crea|tures,
<PB N="28" REF="005029_0026_100E68C368114B30">
on Purpo&s;e to make them mi&s;erable; and &s;o &s;atisfy them&s;elves. Now there is great Danger of &s;uch as the&s;e; e&s;pecially if they have enjoy'd good and powerful Means of Grace, and continued long in this Ca&s;e and contracted Habits of Vice and Sin. <HI>Can the Etheopian change his Skin, or the Leopard his Spots? Then may ye al&s;o do good that are accu&s;tomed to do Evil.</HI> It is no ea&s;y Thing to bring &s;uch to Conviction and Repentance and &s;o to lay a good Foundation of Hope.</P>
<P>But then there are others who are or have been under powerful Awakenings and Convictions, the Word of God has been &s;et home with Power on their Hearts; &s;o that they are convinced that &s;uch Things as they hitherto re&s;ted in, are by no Means any good Foundation to rely on. Now if &s;uch as the&s;e come, after this, again to fix upon any other fal&s;e and un|&s;afe Foundation of Hope; their Danger will be even greater than the others, nay inexpre&s;&s;ible. This I take to be plainly taught in that of our Lord. Mat. 21. 31, 32. <HI>Je&s;us &s;aith unto them that the Publicans and the Harlots go into the Kingdom of God before you, for John came unto you in a Way of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and ye believed him not: but the Publicans and the Harlots believed him,</HI> &amp;c. Their having had &s;uch Advanta|ges, and too much tru&s;ted to them, made it the har|der to unhinge them, and bring them to &s;ee that in|deed they had no good Ground of Hope.</P>
<P>And having ob&s;erved this I may proceed to con|&s;ider more particularly the Danger of having an ill|grounded Hope, and the Danger of this may be con&s;idered as it re&s;pects this Life and that to come, although what may be &s;aid as to the fir&s;t, terminates in the other World.</P>
<P N="1">1. I &s;hall con&s;ider <HI>this Danger as to this Life, while we are Probationers for another.</HI> And under this Head I may &s;ay,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="29" REF="005029_0027_100E68C4EA89E098">1. <HI>If Per&s;ons come to have a fixed Hope of future Hap|pine&s;s, and Salvation, upon an un&s;afe Foundation,</HI> (e&s;pe|cially after great Advantages and Illuminations and after they have been brought off from &s;ome former fal&s;e Grounds of Hope) <HI>there is very great Danger that they will never be undeceiv'd.</HI></P>
<P>It is no ea&s;y Matter, to bring, even tho&s;e, that have lived all their Days in Sin, and have done no|thing to &s;ecure the Favour of God through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and &s;o have no Grounds at all to hope for Happine&s;s; to &s;ee the Evil of their Ways and the Danger they are in of peri&s;hing; e&s;pecially, if to their own Corruptions there be added a bad Edu|cation, and &s;inful Examples, and &s;uch as tempt Men, to neglect the Concerns of their Souls.</P>
<P>Men are apt to be fond of, and partial to their own Ways of thinking; and the Ways in which they have been brought up; hence we have that Direction, <HI>Train up a Child in the Way wherein be &s;hould go</HI>; and this Rea&s;on is given for it, becau&s;e <HI>when he is old be will not depart from it.</HI> Prov. 22. 6. We &s;ee &s;ome Per&s;ons although they are favoured with all Go&s;pel-Priviledges, and have much Pains taken with them, &amp; altho' they can't but know (if they would con&s;ider it) that they are in an unconverted E&s;tate, and &s;o have no good Foundation to hope for Happi|ne&s;s; yet going on from Year to Year, in a tho'tle&s;s unconcerned Way, as if they were &s;ure of Happi|ne&s;s after Death.</P>
<P>It is hard to bring &s;ome &s;uch to a Sen&s;e of their Sinfulne&s;s and mi&s;erable Condition. But if they are brought to &s;ee &s;omething of their undone and lo&s;t E&s;tate while in this Condition; to &s;ee their Sins and that if they continue as they are, they mu&s;t pe|ri&s;h: and after this, by any Means they come to re&s;t upon &s;ome other fal&s;e and un&s;afe Foundation of

Hope; after they have been under powerful Con|victions, and after they have taken &s;ome Pains to fix on a good Bottom; it will be more difficult to convince them of their Mi&s;take and bring them to lay a good Foundation of Hope, than it was before. When Per&s;ons are come to fix their Thoughts after &s;ome Pains taken; they are u&s;ually very Tenacious of their own Thoughts; and if you tell them that after all that they have done, and that they hope they have experienc'd; they are yet without a good Hope, and will peri&s;h if they don't get a better; it will be no ea&s;y Matter to make them believe it altho' ever &s;o true. And you may in&s;tead of doing them any good, get a Blot to your&s;elf, as they that reprove a Scorner do.</P>
<P>And be&s;ides this (if they have been led into Mi&s;|takes by the Injudiciou&s;ne&s;s or Incorrectne&s;s of &s;uch Preachers as they have admired) this will be likely to confu&s;e their Minds, they &s;carcely knowing what or who to believe; which will render it harder to undeceive them, and may have other very ill Con|&s;equents with Re&s;pect to them.</P>
<P>Experience &s;hows us how difficult it is, to bring Men off from any &s;maller Mi&s;takes, when they are fixed in them; and con&s;idering the Subtilty of the great Enemy, and the Corruptions of our own Hearts, we may well &s;uppo&s;e, it will be harder to per&s;uade Men to think that all they have been doing is to no Pur|po&s;e, and that they mu&s;t go back to the very Foun|dation and do all anew. This is apt to &s;hock them and make them &s;tart back: and it will be well if it don't make &s;ome de&s;perately re&s;olve to continue as they are, even at all Hazzards.</P>
<P>Now if we con&s;ider this, it will appear to be a Matter of great Importance to every Soul to build their Hope of Salvation, on a &s;ure Foundation. And
<PB N="31" REF="005029_0029_100E68C8F2310B78">
if you find you have once been deceived and have had a fal&s;e Hope, &s;urely it highly concerns you now, to lay a good Foundation; and in order to this you mu&s;t labour, u&s;e all proper Means and be much in Prayer. Let me ju&s;t add here, we &s;ee hence how very careful Mini&s;ters ought to be, to direct and a&s;|&s;i&s;t People in Di&s;tre&s;s and under Convictions, to lay a good and &s;ure Foundation of Hope, a Mi&s;take in this may prove very prejudicial to Souls. But this mu&s;t &s;uffice for this Head.</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>We &s;hould &s;trive and pray that our Hope of Salvation may be on good Grounds; becau&s;e if our Hopes are built on a fal&s;e Foundation, we &s;hall be in Dan|ger of neglecting all Means and Endeavours to have a good Hope, and &s;o &s;hall be in Danger of peri&s;hing.</HI></P>
<P>There is Danger, not only, that &s;uch will go on deceiving and being deceived; but if &s;o they will be likely wholly to neglect all tho&s;e Things which are nece&s;&s;ary in order to their having a good Hope and &s;o to their Salvation. <HI>They that are whole, need not the Phy&s;ician; but they that are &s;ick.</HI> If Per&s;ons are come to this, that they are per&s;waded they are in Chri&s;t, that they are converted and born again; they will by no Means u&s;e tho&s;e Means which they ought to u&s;e in order to obtain the&s;e Things.</P>
<P>Although we can merit nothing at the Hands of God, by the mo&s;t diligent U&s;e of Means; yet God has appointed Means to be u&s;ed by us, in order to our having a good Foundation of Hope. <HI>Faith comes by Hearing, and Hearing by tbe Word of God.</HI> Rom. 10.17. We mu&s;t endeavour to <HI>work out our Salvation with Fear and Trembling,</HI> if we would have <HI>God work in us to will, and do of his own good Plea&s;ure.</HI> Phillip. 2. 12, 13. And &s;urely if we flatter our&s;elves that the Work of God be already wrought in us, and we are in the Way to Happine&s;s we &s;hall be likely to neg|lect
<PB N="32" REF="005029_0030_100E68CB8589C150">
the&s;e Means, we &s;hall not read, hear, nor pray as if we thought our&s;elves without Hope. And if we indeed have no good Foundation of Hope; but are yet in our Sins, what infinite Danger &s;hall we be in of being <HI>a&s;hamed of our Hope</HI> and of eternal Mi&s;e|ry. And this leads me to the &s;econd more general Head. Viz. To con&s;ider</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>The dreadful and amazing Condition of &s;uch as build their Hopes of Happine&s;s on a fal&s;e Founda|tion, in the World to come.</HI></P>
<P>At Death, when the Soul &s;hall depart into the World of Spirits then it &s;hall at once be convinced of the Fal&s;enefs of the Foundation of it's pa&s;t Hopes. Then their <HI>Hope &s;hall make them a&s;hamed.</HI> When they find them&s;elves di&s;appointed of the Enjoyment of all they hoped for. The very Thought of this is, enough to fill us with Horror.</P>
<P>Such as only dream of Happine&s;e hereafter, al|though they have no Manner of Grounds to hope for it, and &s;uch as go on in a bold De&s;iance of the Wrath of God and eternal Mi&s;ery; will find when they come to experience what it is to be damned, that it is &s;o much more dreadful and amazing than their mo&s;t enlarged Thoughts could reach; that even their Di&s;appointment and Mi&s;ery will be di&s;tre&s;&s;ing and amazing.</P>
<P>But will not their Ca&s;e be more mi&s;erable, their Di&s;|appointment more intolerable, who have had many great Advantages, many Strivings of the Spirit, and who have been brought near to the Kingdom of Heaven; but after all have wilfully, carele&s;ly and wickedly all along neglected to lay a good Foundation of Hope.</P>
<P>How amazing will it be to go to Hell full of the the Hopes of Heaven and Glory. Don't you think that the Di&s;appointment <HI>Haman</HI> met with was very
<PB N="33" REF="005029_0031_100E68CE0CDD3A68">
dreadful, who when he was full of Hopes of being advanced to die highe&s;t Honour and Grandure; and of obtaining his full De&s;ire on <HI>Mordecai, E&s;ther</HI> 7, found him&s;elf at once accu&s;ed, and condemned and dragged away to a mi&s;erable Death? But this was nothing at all to the &s;urprizing and awful Di&s;appoint|ment, of &s;uch as &s;hall have their <HI>Hopes make them a|&s;hamed</HI> at Death; What Tongue can tell, what Heart conceive! The Horror, Shame, and Angui&s;h that will fill the Souls of &s;uch who &s;hall find that they are for ever &s;hut out of Heaven, and all Hopes of the lea&s;t Happine&s;s which they before hoped for, and in&s;tead of this they them&s;elves &s;ent down with Devils and damned Spirits into that Lake which burns with Fire and Brim&s;tone for ever. Is it di&s;|tre&s;&s;ing to us to be di&s;appointed when we are big with Hopes and Expectations that we are ju&s;t ready to enjoy &s;ome earthly Good? how much more tormenting, to be di&s;appointed and that for ever, of the expected Enjoyment of all po&s;&s;ible Happine&s;s, and to endure all po&s;&s;ible Mi&s;ery!</P>
<P>Now from all the&s;e Con&s;iderations laid together, it will appear to be of the greate&s;t Concern to us, to endeavour and pray that we may have a well-groun|ded Hope of Salvation. In the&s;e. Things I have en|deavoured to excite you to &s;eek a good Hope, from Fear of the ill Con&s;equences of the contrary. It may be proper further to confirm the Doctrine, by addre&s;&s;ing your Hope in &s;ome other Particulars, which will turn our Thoughts to much more plea&s;ant Meditations. And here,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, <HI>If you rightly endeavour and pay for a well-grounded Hope, and a comfortable Sen&s;e of it you will be likely to obtain it.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e are not Things that cannot be obtained; many have and many (in this wonderful Day of
<PB N="34" REF="005029_0032_100E68D0923AAFE0">
Grace) do obtain them. And you have Rea&s;on to think you may al&s;o, if you &s;eek them in a right Man|ner. I can't but think that the Rea&s;on why &s;o many have a fal&s;e and ill-grounded Hope, is, in a great Mea&s;ure, becau&s;e they don't take due Care to have a better. And the Rea&s;on &s;o many are without a comfortable A&s;&s;urance that they have a well-groun|ded Hope, who indeed have good Grounds of Hope, is very much, becau&s;e they don't <HI>give all Diligence to make their Calling and Election &s;ure.</HI> The Text inti|mates that by proper Labour and Prayer we may ob|tain &s;uch an Hope as we &s;hall not be a&s;hamed of: in this Way many have obtained it, and in this Way we are directed to &s;eek it; And this &s;hould quicken us to die utmo&s;t Endeavours after &s;uch an Hope, and the Evidences of it: And you have as much Encouragement to hope for Succe&s;s herein as others. But then if we would obtain this, we are not to think a few &s;aint Wi&s;hes and heartle&s;s Pray|ers are &s;ufficient; it is a Matter of &s;uch Importance, as to be worth all po&s;&s;ible Endeavours, our whole Hearts and Lives are to be chiefly taken up in it. But further to excite you to labour and pray for &s;uch a good Hope con&s;ider the Advantages of it in this World and the other. Three Advantages may be mentioned which relate to this Life and World. As</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t <HI>A good Hope of future Happine&s;s will &s;erve greatly to &s;upport and comfort us under all the Afflictions we meet with in life.</HI></P>
<P>We are here in a World of Sorrows and Troubles, and greatly need &s;omething to &s;upport and bear us up under them. Now if we have a good and well-grounded Hope that we are in Chri&s;t, and &s;o that we Have the Love and Favour of God, and his Ble&s;&s;ing
<PB N="35" REF="005029_0033_100E68D3187EB4C8">
and are in the Way to eternal life; this will be our greate&s;t Comfort and Support.</P>
<P>When &s;uch as are favoured with this Hope are under very heavy outward Afflictions, grievous and repeated Bereavements, or other Di&s;tre&s;s; to con&s;i|der that this, yea all Things are order'd out to us by our heavenly Father, our Covenant-God, to con&s;ider his Covenant-Faithfulne&s;s, his infinite Perfections, and his gracious Promi&s;es that <HI>all Things &s;hall work together for our Good,</HI> and that <HI>the&s;e light Afflictions which are but for a Moment, &s;hall work out for us a far more exceeding and eternal Weight of Glory</HI>; and al&s;o <HI>that Tribulation worketh Patience, and Patience Experience, and Experience</HI> &s;uch an <HI>Hope as &s;hall not make us a&s;ha|med.</HI> What greater and &s;tronger Con&s;olation can we have under our outward Afflictions? Nay fur|ther, &s;uch as have comfortable Evidences of this Hope, &s;ometimes have the &s;weet Incomes of the Holy Spirit, delightful Communion with God, and the mo&s;t the &s;en&s;ible and reviving Manife&s;tations of the Love and Favour of God to their Souls, while under outward Afflictions. The&s;e Comforts are not al|ways alike in tho&s;e that have a good Hope: But they that have not a good Hope of Salvation have no Grounds to expect them, any of them at all.</P>
<P>I would further ob&s;erve that this Hope will help to &s;upport us under &s;piritual Trials and Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, which even &s;uch may be in; this will greatly &s;tren|gthen the Believer again&s;t the fierce Temptations and A&s;&s;aults of the evil one, hence we are advi&s;ed to <HI>put on the Hope of Salvation for an Helmet,</HI> 1 The&s;&s;. 5. 8.</P>
<P>This will &s;upport us under a Sen&s;e of our remain|ing Corruptions and Imperfections; when we are a&s;leep this will keep our Hearts awake, and if, ur Beloved withdraw; it will awake us up to &s;eek after him, till we find him.&mdash;<HI>Cant.</HI> 5. beginning.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="005029_0034_100E68D5AA794A80">They that have a real &s;ure Ground of Hope; will not in their Times of the greate&s;t Darkne&s;s and De|&s;ertions utterly lo&s;e it, for any long Time; although <HI>in a little Wrath, God may hide his Face for a Moment! yet with everla&s;ting Kindne&s;s will be return, and have Mercy on them.</HI> Their <HI>Hope</HI> will be <HI>as an Anchor to the Soul,</HI> keeping it from &s;inking when Waves and Billows pa&s;s over it.</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>When we have good Evidences that our Hope is well-grounded, this gives us very great Joy, Peace and Comfort in this World.</HI></P>
<P>If our Hopes of Salvation be built upon a &s;ure and &s;afe Foundation, it never will make us a&s;hamed; al|though we may not have &s;uch clear and comforting Evidences of it. And I have no Doubt but &s;ome have really a good Hope of Salvation and yet are under Doubts as to the Foundation of their Hopes, and although &s;ometimes their Evidences of their good E&s;tate are clear and bright, yet at other Times they may be more clouded, and le&s;s &s;en&s;ible.</P>
<P>Now as the lea&s;t good Grounds to hope that we have an Intere&s;t in Chri&s;t, and &s;o are in the Way to obtain Salvation will give us Joy and Comfort, &s;o in Proportion, to the Degrees of Evidence of this, will our Plea&s;ure and Joy be. And when the Beliaver upon a due and proper Examination of him&s;elf, finds the Evidences that his Hope of Happine&s;s, is well-grounded, very bright and clear, and when the Spi|rit of God witne&s;&s;es with his Spirit that he is a Child of God; this will put greater Joy and Gladne&s;s into their Hearts, than the Increa&s;e of all outward good Things: Nay, it will give them <HI>Joy un&s;peaka|ble and full of Glory.</HI> And if &s;uch Comfort and Joy be worth &s;eeking, we &s;hould labour for &s;uch a Foun|dation of Hope from whence it proceeds,</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="005029_0035_100E68D730FEF418">Thirdly, <HI>This good Hope will be&s;t &s;upport us, under the Apprehen&s;ions, Views and Approaches of Death.</HI></P>
<P>Death will certainly, and may very &s;uddenly, &s;eize upon every one of us: and it is worth while to &s;pend our whole lives in Endeavours, if thereby we may have a comfortable &s;afe and happy Death; and Happine&s;s after it. And we never can have a com|fortable &s;afe and happy Death, without a well-grounded Hope of Happine&s;s after it. I am &s;en&s;i|ble, Sinners may <HI>have no Bands in their Death:</HI> al|though they have no Hope of Salvation; yet they may be &s;tupid and &s;en&s;ele&s;s of their Danger: And &s;o go out of the World without Fear. But how far is this from being an happy and &s;afe Death! We can't die a &s;afe and happy Death unle&s;s after Death we &s;hall be happy; and this can't be unle&s;s the Foundation of it, be laid in this Life. And if our Salvation be &s;ecured, whether we have a clear View of it ju&s;t before Death or no, yet we &s;hall be happy. Sometimes Believers may have great Doubts and fiery A&s;&s;aults of Satan a little before Death; I think it is not impo&s;&s;ible but &s;ome may go doubt|ing out of this World, to <HI>Abraham</HI>'s Bo&s;om; nor is it at all improbable.</P>
<P>But with what Calmne&s;s and Serenity of Soul may they, that, not only have a good and well-grounded Hope of Glory, but a lively Sen&s;e al&s;o that their <HI>Hope will not make them a&s;hamed,</HI> look Death in the Face! He that is the King of Terrors to Sinners, is but a welcome Me&s;&s;enger to them, to carry them to the Enjoyment of tho&s;e glorions Things they hope for.</P>
<P>Some, when God has, in the Hour of Death, lifted up the Light of his Countenance upon them, have had &s;uch Vi&s;ions and Foreta&s;tes of Glory, &s;uch bright and clear Di&s;coveries of the Love of God
<PB N="38" REF="005029_0036_100E68D9B6928520">
to their Souls; and of their Intere&s;t in Chri&s;t; and Chri&s;t has appeared &s;o lovely and glorious to them, that they have as it were, forgot the dark Entry they were to pa&s;s thro' to go to Chri&s;t, their Souls &s;eem impatiently (almo&s;t) to wait for his coming: and when the Moment comes, they as 'twere leap forth with unutterable Joy into his Arms.</P>
<P>Thus have I &s;een (to the Glory of free &amp; rich Grace be it &s;poken) &s;ome few both <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> meet the King of Terrors, without Fear and with great Joy. And who at &s;uch a joyful Sight would not cry out, <HI>Let me die the Death of the Righteous, and let my la&s;t End be like his?</HI> And who would not with all po&s;&s;ible Diligence and Ardency of Soul labour and pray for &s;uch an Hope, as will make their Death thus delightful. But it is Time, as this leads me, having thus con&s;idered &s;ome, (and but &s;ome) of the many Advantages of a good Hope in this Life, be|fore and at Death; that I in a few Words,</P>
<P>2dly, Con&s;ider, <HI>That this well-grounded Hope &s;hall be &s;wallowed up, in the full and perfect and everla&s;ting Enjoyment of all that we now hope for, yea and much more, after Death.</HI></P>
<P>Altho there is not an End of Man at Death, but Eternity follows, yet all our pre&s;ent Hopes end with the Death of the Body. The Hope of the Hypocrite and Sinner then ends, and is turned into endle&s;s De&s;pair, Horror and Mi&s;ery. And the Hope of the true Believer then ends, becau&s;e it is &s;wal|lowed up in the Enjoyment of all that he de&s;ired, expected and hoped for! Rom. 8. 24. <HI>That which is &s;een why doth a Man yet hope for</HI>? What&s;oever the enlighten'd and &s;anctified Soul wi&s;hes for or de&s;ires, he &s;hall fully and compleatly po&s;&s;e&s;s and enjoy after Death. They that have this good Hope, &s;hall come <HI>to &s;ee as they are &s;een, to know</HI> (in their Mea&s;ure) <HI>as
<PB N="39" REF="005029_0037_100E68DB6F364208">
they are known,</HI> they &s;hall awake in the divine Like|ne&s;s, they &s;hall be perfectly freed from all Sin, and Temptation to it, from Sorrow and Mi&s;ery and Fears thereof: and their enlarged Souls, with all their Faculties, &s;hall be perfectly &s;atisfied: They &s;hall fully and without Interruption enjoy God the Fa|ther, and the Son their dear and precious Redeemer, and the Spirit of all Grace and Comfort. God will be the &s;atisfying Portion of their Souls forever.</P>
<P>Let me ju&s;t &s;ay here, the Souls of &s;uch as have this Hope, &s;hall be happy and ble&s;&s;ed, while in their State of Separation from the Body; 'till the Re&s;ur|rection of die Body. But as the enlarged Hopes of &s;uch extend to the Re&s;urrection and beyond it, &s;o their Bodies al&s;o &s;hall ari&s;e <HI>glorious Bodies</HI> form'd and <HI>fa&s;hion'd like to Chri&s;t's,</HI> Philip. 3.21. Their ble&s;&s;ed Souls and Bodies being united, &s;hall give up the Ac|count to God in the Judgment with exceeding great Joy. And after this they &s;hall go away into ever|la&s;ting Life.</P>
<P>But why &s;hould I further attempt, to de&s;cribe to you the Joy, Happine&s;s and Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of &s;uch, &s;ince <HI>Eye hath not &s;een, nor Ear heard, neither hath it entered into the Heart of Man,</HI> how exceeding great and glorious their Joy and Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s &s;hall be, and this &s;hall continue to all Eternity. Thus their <HI>Hope &s;hall not make them a&s;hamed.</HI></P>
<P>Thus, brethren, I have given &s;ome Rea&s;ons why we &s;hould labour and &s;trive with all our Powers, and pray with Ardency of Soul, that we may have a well-grounded Hope of Salvation, that will not make us a&s;hamed. And what can be offer'd, that will influence us Hereto, if the&s;e Things will not? And thus have I fini&s;hed what I propo&s;ed for the Proof and Illu&s;|tration of the Doctrine.

<P>Fir&s;t, We infer <HI>the amazing Folly of &s;uch as are either without any Hope of Salvation, or have a fal&s;e Hope.</HI></P>
<P>I can't but fear there are too many &s;uch; and what a dreadful Condition are they in? Con&s;ider, that you are here but for a very little Time; you, are ha&s;tening to an endle&s;s Eternity either of Hap|pine&s;s or Mi&s;ery; and as your Hope is here, whe|ther well or ill grounded, &s;o it will be with you for|ever. And Oh con&s;ider what infinite Happine&s;s you &s;hall enjoy hereafter, if you now indeed &s;ee that your Hope be on a good Foundation: And on the other hand con&s;ider how un&s;peakably amazing it will be to find your&s;elves a&s;hamed of your Hopes at la&s;t. Con&s;ider what has been &s;aid of the&s;e Things, and &s;ay, is it not the greate&s;t Folly and Stupidity, to re&s;t and be ea&s;y without a good and &s;ure Hope of eternal Hap|pine&s;s and Salvation. They who have no Hope, and they who have no better than no Hope, and even tho&s;e who flatter them&s;elves they have a good Hope, although without any ju&s;t Grounds, will be a&s;hamed of their Hopes at la&s;t. And Oh that it were po&s;&s;ible to awaken your Con&s;ciences now, &s;o that you might &s;ee your Stupidity and Folly! Will you, can you calmly and deliberately go on in this Way which you know will end in eternal Torment! And dare any run the amazing Hazard of lo&s;ing their Souls, for Want of a due Care to lay a good Founda|tion of Hope!</P>
<P>Secondly, Hence infer <HI>their Wi&s;dom and Happine&s;s who have</HI> (by the Grace of God) <HI>laid a good and &s;ure Foundation of Hope of eternal Salvation.</HI> Thrice hap|py are they; <HI>all Things are theirs.</HI> They are truly happy here amid&s;t all their outward Afflictions, &amp; Sorrows,
<PB N="41" REF="005029_0039_100E68E080A96B18">
yea neverthele&s;s happy for them. Whether they have a certain and comfortable A&s;&s;urance that their Hope is thus well-grounded or no, yet if it be they are happy, yea, their own Hearts can't conceive the Glory they are to po&s;&s;e&s;s hereafter.</P>
<P>Now whatever it has co&s;t &s;uch, how much Labour and Difficulties &s;oever they have undergone, yet they have &s;hown the greate&s;t Wi&s;dom, in that they have &s;ought till they have obtained &s;uch an Hope.</P>
<P>But I &s;hall not enlarge here, but proceed to &s;ay,</P>
<P>Thirdly, Hence, <HI>Let us all examine our&s;elves, to &s;ee what Foundation we have, for our Hopes of eternal Hap|pine&s;s and Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>You &s;ee &s;omething of the Danger of a fal&s;e Hope, and the glorious Advantages of a true one. And let the&s;e Con&s;iderations quicken every Soul of us to ex|amine our&s;elves, without Delay and before it be too late, what Foundation of Hope we have.</P>
<P>It is nothing le&s;&s; than Heaven and Glory, than the eternal Happine&s;s and Salvation of our never-dying Souls, that we hope for. And O &s;earch and try till you do really find what Foundation you have to hope for the&s;e glorious Things upon, &s;earch deep, look to the very Bottom, &s;ee if the Foundation be laid &s;e|cure and &s;afe. A trifling Examination and &s;earch, will &s;ignify very little. We &s;hould be the more care|ful in this Search and Examination becau&s;e there are &s;o many fal&s;e Foundations of Hope, and &s;o much Danger of our being deceiv'd.</P>
<P>Give me leave to ask you Brethren, and Oh! let your Hearts go with me, and ask your own Souls, &s;uch Que&s;tions as the&s;e, Viz.</P>
<P>Do you hope for Happine&s;s and Salvation, meer|ly becau&s;e God is merciful and gracious, although your Con&s;ciences tell you, you never comply'd with
<PB N="42" REF="005029_0040_100E68E307EDE070">
tho&s;e Things nor come into that Method, upon, and in which alone, you may expect his Mercy?</P>
<P>Although a good Hope originates in the Mercy of God, (as I have &s;hewn) yet to build our Hopes of Happine&s;s upon this, &s;eparated from the Merits of Chri&s;t, and the Covenant of Grace; and when we can't but know, we never have done any Thing in order to obtain the Favour of God through Chri&s;t; is to build our Hopes on a wrong Foundation. God will not glorify his Grace and Mercy, to the Di&s;|honour of any other of his divine Attributes.</P>
<P>Again, do you hope for Salvation, becau&s;e you enjoy the Means of Grace, have heard the be&s;t of Preaching; are born of truly religious Parents; have done &s;ome Duties; yea even come to the &s;pe|cial Ordinances? All the&s;e Things are very great Priviledges, or Duties, and by no Means to be lightly thought or &s;poken of; but all the&s;e alone, unle&s;s you are brought to believe in Chri&s;t, repent of your Sin&s;, and unle&s;s a real Change be wrought in your Hearts, will not give &s;ufficient Ground to hope for Salvation, as I might ea&s;ily &s;hew had I Time. Do you hope for Happine&s;s, becau&s;e others think and &s;peak well of you: Con&s;ider &s;o they may of the greate&s;t Hypocrites: <HI>For we cannot judge the Hearts of Men.</HI></P>
<P>Again, do you hope for Salvation, becau&s;e you have been greatly awakened, enlightened and con|victed? Con&s;ider, Illumination and Convictions, although nece&s;&s;ary to Conver&s;ion, may be where Conver&s;ion is not, there is a legal Sorrow for Sin as well as evangelical, which implies Conviction. Have not your Convictions ari&s;en only from a Sen&s;e of Mi|&s;ery! Let me &s;eriou&s;ly ask you, have you ever been convinced of the Evil &amp; accur&s;ed Nature of Sin? has Sin ever appeared to you exceeding &s;inful? Have you e|ver
<PB N="43" REF="005029_0041_100E68E58D6F9728">
&s;een Sin as it is contrary to the Nature, Attributes; Perfections and Law of God? All Repentance and &s;o all Convictions have Re&s;pect to God, again&s;t whom all Sin is committed. And it is very plain that the brighter Di&s;coveries God makes of him&s;elf to any the more they will &s;ee of the evil Nature of Sin, and of their own Sinfulne&s;s, Vilene&s;s and Mi|&s;ery. See Job 42. 5, 6. <HI>I have heard of thee by the hearing of the Ear: but now mine Eye &s;eeth thee. Wherefore I abhor my&s;elf and repent in Du&s;t and A&s;hes.</HI> Read to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e, I&s;ai. 6. from the 1&s;t to the End of the 5th Ver&s;e; if you have never &s;een any Thing of the Evil of Sin as it is again&s;t God, you have Rea&s;on to fear, you never were rightly convinced of the evil Nature of Sin. And as the Law of God is agreeable to his Nature holy, ju&s;t and good, &s;o if we &s;ee Sin as it is again&s;t God, we &s;hall all &s;ee it in a good Mea&s;ure as it is again&s;t the Law.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t add (for I e&s;teem it a Thing of great Im|portance) have you ever &s;een what a dreadful A|bu&s;e Sin is of the Mercy of God? And particu|larly, as that is di&s;covered, in giving us a glorious Saviour, and &s;o as our Sins pierce our Saviour.</P>
<P>When we con&s;ider this and other Di&s;coveries of the Mercy of God, doth this melt us down into a true and genuine Contrition for our Sins, and di&s;co|ver to us more of its vile Nature. <HI>The Goodne&s;s of God leads to Repentance.</HI> Rom. 2. 4.</P>
<P>But to add no more here, no Conviction may be rely'd upon as a good Ground of Hope, unle&s;s it be followed by a real Conver&s;ion and turning from Sin to God.</P>
<P>Again, do you hope for Happine&s;s, becau&s;e after you have been convicted of Sin, you have &s;uddenly, or by flower Degrees, had great Light, Joy and Com|fort;
<PB N="44" REF="005029_0042_100E68E813F05AD8">
and &s;eemed to have clear Sights, or Vi&s;ions of Chri&s;t and Heaven! I be&s;eech you &s;uffer me in Love and Faithfulne&s;s to your Souls, to tell you: The&s;e Things alone are not to be re&s;ted in as a &s;ure Foundation of Hope of Salvation. <HI>There is the Joy of the Hypocrite as well as of the true Believer,</HI> Job 20. 5. We read, <HI>that the triumphing of the Wicked is &s;hort, and the Joy of the Hypocrite but for a Moment,</HI> And the Apo&s;tle tells us, 2 Cor. 11. 14. That <HI>Satan him&s;elf is transformed into an Angel of Light.</HI> It is to be feared &s;ome may be deceived with fal&s;e and ill-grounded Joys. Such &s;en&s;ible Enjoyments and Manife&s;tations are exceeding &s;weet and refre&s;hing, when after &s;ome Clouds, the Soul of the Believer, has been &s;eeking hard after God; and when the&s;e Things are accompany'd with other good and clear Evidences of a good Hope. What I caution you again&s;t is placing too much in &s;uch &s;en&s;ible Enjoy|ments; and taking them for Evidences of Conver|&s;ion, when indeed they are not in them&s;elves, to be re&s;ted in as &s;uch. Let me ju&s;t add, do you hope for Salvation becau&s;e you have partly for&s;aken your former Sins and partly comply'd with your former neglected Duties? we are glad of any Reformation, in any Thing, and how much more glad &s;hould we be to &s;ee a thorough univer&s;al Reformation of your Lives, proceeding from a real Change wrought in your Hearts! But I mu&s;t tell you that there may be a partial Reformation where there is not a thorough Reformation, and there may be a con&s;iderable out|ward Change and Reformation for a Time, and yet not any real Change wrought in the Heart, without which you are not converted in a Go&s;pel-Sen&s;e: every Change is not Conver&s;ion; your different Way of Living, different Company and the differ|ent Manner of Conver&s;ation: the Examples of o|thers,
<PB N="45" REF="005029_0043_100E68EA9F51E608">
whom you e&s;teem, or your going from one Stage of Life to another; may give you a different Turn of Thought and be the Means of your di&s;re|li&s;hing &s;ome evil Things you before took Plea|&s;ure in, and &s;o cau&s;e a Change in you: But in this Ca&s;e you ought carefully to con&s;ider whether you have turned from Sin to God, agreeable to that Jer. 4. 1. <HI>If thou wilt return, O I&s;rael, &s;aith the Lord, return unto me,</HI> Joel 2. 12. There may be a turning from one Sin to another, only an Exchange of Lu&s;ts and Sins; but this is of no Manner of Advantage. Conver&s;ion implies a turning from all and every in|dividual Sin, and al&s;o a turning unto God. Into his Service, and an holy Obedience to him, and in to all his Ways.</P>
<P>But not to be further tedious here, consider and clo&s;ely examine whether you have laid the Foun|dation of your Hope deep and &s;ure, have you ever been convinced of Sin as it is again&s;t God, and of your own per&s;onal Guilt, that you are the Man? Have you had a real Change wrought in you, are the Hearts of Stone taken out of you, and Hearts of Fle&s;h given to you? And have you truly em|braced Chri&s;t as your only and all-&s;ufficient Saviour, your Prophet, Prie&s;t and King? And doth your Hope purify your Hearts? By the&s;e and &s;uch o|ther Marks, which have been more largely con&s;i|dered before; you may in &s;ome Mea&s;ure come to know whether you have a good Hope of Salvation or not.</P>
<P>But you need the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Holy Spirit, in your Self-Examination, the Spirit not only works in Believers Souls tho&s;e Things which are the Foundation of Hope; but when they, as in the Pre&s;ence and Fear of God and humbly &s;eeking the Help of the Spirit, &s;et them&s;elves to a clo&s;e and
<PB N="46" REF="005029_0044_100E68EC21FEB2A0">
&s;erious Examination of them&s;elves as to their &s;piri|tual E&s;tate, he graciou&s;ly a&s;&s;i&s;ts them, brings Things to their Minds, and gives them to &s;ee that they have &s;uch Things in them as are the Evidences of a good Hope, and &s;o enables them to draw a &s;ure Conclu&s;ion that they are in the Way to Glory. And when the Spirit gives the&s;e Evidences in their full Strength and Brightne&s;s and &s;o as to remove Doubts from them, this is a full A&s;&s;urance of Hope: And now the Spirit may be &s;aid to witne&s;s with our Spirits that we are the Children of God.</P>
<P>But it is high Time I &s;hould proceed in the fourth Place to a U&s;e of Exhortation, with which I &s;hall conclude all.</P>
<P>And the Exhortation may be addre&s;s'd to the following Sorts of Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, I would &s;peak to &s;uch as are <HI>thoughtle&s;s and unconcerned although they have no Manner of Foun|dation to hope for Salvation upon.</HI></P>
<P>And are there not &s;ome &s;uch, who now hear me, even in &s;uch a Day of the wonderful Striving of the Spirit as this is! And after all that God has done for them? I am afraid there are &s;ome who if they were asked what Ground they have to hope for Salvation hereafter; could only tell you, that God is merciful, and they are his Creatures. And &s;o they hope for Mercy, although they in a mo&s;t horrid and &s;hameful Manner abu&s;e the Mercy of God e|very Day, although they live in all Manner of Sin and Wickedne&s;s, &s;erving the Devil and gratifying their own Heart's Lu&s;ts. Surely as to &s;uch I may &s;ay you are without Hope, you are trea&s;uring up to your&s;elves Wrath again&s;t the Day of Wrath, and Revelation of the righteous Judgment of God. But are there not others who although they don't live the mo&s;t vicious Lives; yet have no Rea&s;on to
<PB N="47" REF="005029_0045_100E68EDA2FCF860">
believe they have ever repented of Sin, or received a Saviour, that ever they have been converted, and that do indulge &s;ome Sins; And yet are perfectly &s;en&s;ele&s;s of any Danger, go on in a Series of Thoughtle&s;&s;ne&s;s, and a perfect Neglect of the Sal|vation of their precious and immortal Souls. And Oh what a dreadful Condition are all &s;uch in!</P>
<P>With what Words &s;hall I &s;peak unto you, to per|&s;wade you to a proper Concern for your&s;elves? You, it is like have no Sen&s;e of your Danger, and have no Concern for your&s;elves, don't pity your|&s;elves; but your faithful Mini&s;ters are concerned for you, and even <HI>travail in Birth for you.</HI></P>
<P>Be exhorted, poor mi&s;erable Souls, at lea&s;t to &s;it down and con&s;ider, what a Ca&s;e you are indeed in. You can be but little longer in this World, and what will become of you when God &s;hall require your Souls and you &s;hall go over into an immen&s;e and endle&s;s Eternity; Chri&s;t is the only Saviour and him you de&s;pi&s;e and &s;light, you will not receive him nor have him to rule over you, and how can you be happy! Nay look into your Hearts and en|deavour to &s;ee &s;omething what you are: look up|wards, and con&s;ider the Being Perfections and At|tributes of God: And &s;ee how unlike him you are, and how impo&s;&s;ible it is you &s;hould be happy in the Enjoyment of God. Con&s;ider the Inhabitants, the Enjoyments and Employments of Heaven: and think whether you are a Companion fit for &s;uch Beings, and a Per&s;on qualified for &s;uch Work and Enjoyments? And then O turn your Eyes down to Hell, and con&s;ider how much you are like the Devils in your Tempers and Di&s;po&s;itions, and how much fit|ter you are for the cur&s;ed Employments of Hell, and the Mi&s;eries thereof, than for Heaven. See (and O that you could &s;ee) the Wrath of God
<PB N="48" REF="005029_0046_100E68F06711F400">
that hangs over you, and the Gulf of Fire and Brim&s;tone that gapes for you beneath.&mdash;Strive as you value your Souls to &s;ee your undone and mi&s;erable E&s;tate; and work out your Salvation with Fear and Trembling: Give your&s;elves no Re&s;t, and delay not one Moment, until you have laid a &s;ure Foundation of Hope of Salvation. Con&s;ider there is a Saviour offered and Salvation is offered to you as well as others. And why will you not accept the Offer? The Spirit of God is &s;triving in a wonderful Manner with People, here and el&s;ewhere, many are now taken, and why will you be le&s;t; &s;hall your Parents, &s;hall your Brethren and Si&s;ters; &s;hall your Neigh|bours, yea &s;hall your Children or even your Ser|vants, be taken by the Grace of God and be e|ternally happy? And will you be the only Per|&s;ons that will &s;tand out again&s;t the Calls of God and the Strivings of the Spirit? Are you re&s;ol|ved to go on in your carnal Security, without any Foundation of Hope of Happine&s;s, till you drop into everla&s;ting Mi&s;ery! Oh that it were po&s;&s;i|ble (while it is an accepted Time and Day of Salvation) to awaken you to a Sen&s;e of your Sin and Mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>But I turn my&s;elf &s;econdly, <HI>to awakened and con|vinced Sinners, who are now &s;en&s;ible, that your former Hopes were vain, and &s;o are de&s;irous without Delay, to lay a good Foundation of Hope</HI></P>
<P>There is more Hope of you now than ever before, that you may be plucked as Brands out of the Burning: Ble&s;s God therefore that you are awakened and convinced; And by all Means cheri&s;h your Convictions; And &s;ee that they don't wear off, until you are converted. And let me tell you there is Danger that you will now
<PB N="49" REF="005029_0047_100E68F4140A8610">
build your Hopes upon a fal&s;e Foundation. The Devil is alarmed at your Awakening and Convic|tions; and if it be po&s;&s;ible he will either quench your Convictions and cau&s;e them to wear off; &s;o that you may have &s;ome &s;eeming Red and Ea&s;e; or he will bring you to re&s;t upon &s;ome new and fal&s;e Foundation of Hope and &s;o deceive you at la&s;t: Therefore, dear Friends and Brethren, con|&s;ider well what you do, and be advi&s;ed and di|rected,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, <HI>Not to be too ha&s;ly and &s;udden, in think|ing you are converted and in taking Comfort.</HI></P>
<P>I am afraid many deceive them&s;elves by this. When they are under powerful Convictions and as it were &s;inking down into deep Waters; they are ready; (like a drowning Man) to catch hold of any Thing they can; to lay hold of any thing that looks like Conver&s;ion; and &s;o, through the Deceitfulne&s;s, of Satan, their own Hearts of Sin, (and 'twere well if not through the <HI>Ignorance</HI> and <HI>Ra&s;hne&s;s</HI> of &s;ome that pretend to be <HI>Teachers</HI> and <HI>Exhorters</HI>) are in great Danger of thinking them|&s;elves in a good E&s;tate when they are not. Oh beware of this! You &s;ee you have hitherto been deceived; &s;ee to it that you don't now re&s;t up|on another equally fal&s;e Foundation of Hope; this may be infinitely dangerous to you, as you have heard. Let me advi&s;e you therefore,</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>To &s;tudy carefully what a good and &s;ure Foundation of Hope is on which you may &s;afely re&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>A Mi&s;take in this may be fatal, therefore be ex|ceeding careful about it; and before you cry Peace to your Souls; &s;ee that you have a full and clear Under&s;tanding what it is you may &s;afely
<PB N="50" REF="005029_0048_100E68F596B69B10">
re&s;t upon; and here I be&s;eech you make the <HI>precious Bible</HI> your Rule. Study that, and &s;uch good Books as are agreeable to it. Don't regard &s;o much what others tell you of their Experien|ces; And what you mu&s;t find and feel in your &s;elves, as what the Word of God tells you, you mu&s;t find and experience, Call no Man Lord or Ma&s;ter here, and let nothing &s;atisfy your Souls till you come to be well a&s;&s;ured that you have indeed tho&s;e Marks and Evidences that you are real Chri|&s;tians, which are recorded in the holy Word of God. In a Word, re&s;t not till your Hopes are built upon the Foundations before mentioned.</P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>Be prevailed on duely to attend on the publick Wor&s;hip and other Means of Grace.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God.</HI> Rom. 10. 17. If you love your Souls let no Temptation be able to hinder you from this; and attend with proper Care, Diligence, and Con&s;tancy: And by no Means needle&s;ly and often, (as with <HI>itching Ears</HI>) wander from the Place of your &s;tated Wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>Fourthly, <HI>Be much in Self-Examination.</HI></P>
<P>When you are &s;atisfied what is a good Foun|dation of Hope, &s;ee whether you have built your Hopes upon it, this you mu&s;t come to a Know|ledge of, by examining your &s;elves, be much, be often, therefore in this and &s;ee that your Exami|nation be thorough and impartial. Set your&s;elves as in the Pre&s;ence of an holy, an heart-&s;earching God, and imploring his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;earch your|&s;elves and the Foundation of your Hope to the very Bottom.</P>
<P>Fifthly, <HI>Be careful lea&s;t you be to&s;&s;ed about wth e|very Wind of Doctrine.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="005029_0049_100E68F9C7AE2020">Beware left by hearing many different Preachers (who if they think alike, yet may expre&s;s them|&s;elves very differently) you get lo&s;t and confu&s;ed in your Thoughts, and &s;o become uncapable of determining any Thing about your&s;elves and your &s;piritual E&s;tate. I will only add,</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly.</HI> Be much in Prayer to God.</P>
<P>Plead with him to lead you into a plain Path; cry mightily to God that he will &s;ave you from re&s;ting upon any fal&s;e Foundations. That he will work in you a true Repentance of and Conver&s;ion from Sin and an un&s;eigned Faith in our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that he will accept you in the Covenant of Grace, and entitle you to all his gracious Promi|&s;es, that &s;o your Hope of Happine&s;s may be &s;ure and well-grounded; in&s;tead of con&s;ulting tho&s;e who know but very little, either <HI>doctrinally</HI> or <HI>ex|perimentally</HI> of the&s;e Things; go to tho&s;e, whom Chri&s;t having <HI>accounted faithful hath &s;et over you in the Mini&s;try</HI>: Enquire of them what you &s;hall do to be &s;aved in a meek and humble Manner. If you in the&s;e and &s;uch like Ways cheri&s;h your Convictions and endeavour to lay a good Foun|dation of Hope, you will be in a Way of obtain|ing &s;uch an Hope as will never make you a&s;hamed.</P>
<P>Thirdly, I am to &s;peak a few Words to <HI>&s;uch as hope you are in the Way to Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>You have heard, from the Word of God, that there is Danger that you may be a&s;hamed of your Hope. Let all &s;uch therefore be exhorted to &s;ee to it that the Foundation of your Hope be good. A bear Po&s;&s;ibility of your being deceived, &s;hould quicken you to the greate&s;t Care in examining the Foundation you build upon. Could I certainly tell you that there is one, in this great A&s;&s;embly that although he is full of the Hopes of Heaven yet
<PB N="52" REF="005029_0050_100E68FD55CB29A0">
has no Foundation therefor, and &s;o will be a&s;ha|med of his Hopes; would you not all be ready with the Di&s;ciples to &s;ay, <HI>Lord is it I, Lord is it I</HI>? It is our Duty to be often looking over the Evi|dences of our good E&s;tate, &amp; let us be per&s;uaded to do it. Let us go back to the very beginning and &s;ee what it is that we laid as the Foundation of our Hope; &s;ee whether that be good. And if any Soul of us who are Profe&s;&s;ors, and have a Hope of Salvation find that our Hope is built on the Sand, Oh! let us bewail it before God and im|mediately be up and doing, and endeavouring to lay a better Foundation of Hope. Ble&s;&s;ed be God it may not be too late; there may yet be Hope for &s;uch, if they will without Delay &s;trive and endeavour to rectify this dangerous Mi&s;take, and as your Hearts have hitherto deceived you, be very jealous over them. Be careful, above all Things, that you be no more deceived in a Matter of &s;uch infinite Im|portance: But &s;ee that you now lay a good Foun|dation of Hope.</P>
<P>To conclude, if after the be&s;t Examination you find; (as I hope many of you will) that your Hopes of Salvation are well-grounded, <HI>give all the Glory to God,</HI> who&s;e Work it is: beware of do|ing any Thing to darken your Evidences to cau&s;e the Comforter that now relieves your Souls, to go far from you, endeavour every Way to per&s;wade, a&s;&s;i&s;t and allure others to come into the &s;ame happy Condition with your&s;elves.</P>
<P>Happy, Brethren, are you here, happy &s;hall you be at Death, happy &s;hall you be to all Eter|nity; Through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to whom with the Father and Spirit, be Prai&s;es everla&s;ting. AMEN.</P>
