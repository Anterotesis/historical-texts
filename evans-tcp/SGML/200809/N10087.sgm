<HEAD>The PREFACE To the Reader.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Legali&s;t</HI> has been, either regular in his conduct in life from his youth up, keeping all the commandments; &s;o as to &s;ay from his <HI>deceitful and de&s;perately wicked heart, what lack I yet</HI>? or his good deeds, in his own view&punc; ri&s;e &s;o &s;uperior to his evil ones, as to think it unju&s;t that his failings &s;hould be marked again&s;t him: Or, if he was once abandoned to enormous vices, again&s;t the light of natural con|&s;cience, yet he can now thank God that he is not as he once was, but has e&s;caped tho&s;e gro&s;s pollutions of the world, and become a religious ob&s;erver of the external duties of religion.</P>
<P>He thinks his piety and practice of duty will go far to &s;atisfy for his pa&s;t mi&s;conduct. He hopes a merciful God will not deal with him in &s;trict law and ju&s;tice; and that Chri&s;t will &s;atisfy for his defects; and his hope in the mercy of God, and the merits of Chri&s;t, is greatly emboldened by the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his own worthine&s;s, the paucity and trivial nature of his &s;ins, and his abundant duties. He has &s;o little to a&s;k of God, it would &s;eem to him hard, &s;evere, and in a mea&s;ure unju&s;t, to he denied So he goes on in the way of death, hoping for life. He knows not God, his perfections and maje&s;ty; nor the &s;trictne&s;s and purity of his law. He has no proper meaning, in u&s;ing the words <HI>grace, mercy,</HI> or <HI>the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God;</HI> and ignorantly hopes, God will &s;ave him in a way that never entered into the heart of God to &s;ave one of all the rebellious race.</P>
<P>So the infidel Jews, not &s;eeing Chri&s;t to be the end of the moral, and &s;cope of their ceremonial law, practi&s;ed upon the Sinai-law, as a covenant of works, and vainly hoped, <HI>by doing the&s;e things,</HI> to <HI>live in them,</HI> not regarding the plain expre&s;&s;ions of their own law, <HI>cur&s;ing every man that continueth not</HI> (perfectly) <HI>in all
<PB REF="012816_0003_0F8ABB1B90BA68E0">
things written in the book of the law to do them:</HI> and &s;o pe|ri&s;hed under the bondage of corruption. Gal. <HI>iv. 24, 25.&mdash;The one</HI> (covenant) <HI>from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar. For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and an&s;wereth to Jeru&s;alem which now is</HI> (the pre&s;ent carnal infidel Jews) <HI>and is in bondage with her children.</HI></P>
<P>The Antinomian, not having a thorough conviction by the law as a tran&s;gre&s;&s;or, or a regular divorce from it, in order for a lawful marriage with the king of grace, in a prevailing and criminal &s;elf-love upon &s;ome &s;uperficial or delu&s;ive manife&s;tations, clo&s;es with the go&s;pel promi&s;es of life by grace thro' the redeemer, and <HI>rejoices in hope of</HI> &s;eeing <HI>the glory of God.</HI> But the moral law is not (as in all true di&s;ciples) written upon his heart; hence he has no &s;uch knowledge of &s;in by the law as to aba&s;e, &s;hame and confound him. He is not like the father of the faithful, who, when God revealed his covenant love, <HI>fell on his face;</HI> or like Job, who in a like ca&s;e <HI>abhorred him&s;elf, and repented in du&s;t and a&s;hes;</HI> or like Ephraim, who, <HI>after that he was turned</HI> (effectually by divine grace) <HI>repented, and after that he was in&s;tructed</HI> (by the holy Gho&s;t, and led into all truth both of law and go&s;pel) <HI>&s;mote upon his thigh,</HI> with grief and indignation, <HI>was a&s;hamed, yea even confounded, becau&s;e he did bear the reproach of his youth;</HI> or like peni|tent Mary, who &s;tood behind her Saviour, wa&s;hed his <HI>feet with her tears</HI> of godly &s;orrow, <HI>and did wipe them with the hairs of her head,</HI> which had been (it is pre&s;umed) the fuel of her pride and wantonne&s;s.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Antinomian convert</HI> is ravi&s;hed with his own good|ne&s;s, not <HI>knowing the plague of his own heart,</HI> is plea&s;ed with the good temper thereof, <HI>tru&s;ts to him&s;elf that he is righteous and de&s;pi&s;eth others.</HI> The &s;elf-flattering a&s;&s;urance of his con|ver&s;ion is the head-&s;pring of his joy. His &s;pirit doth not <HI>re|joice in God his Saviour,</HI> but in him&s;elf, in his own &s;uppo&s;ed humility and gracious feelings. Neverthele&s;s, he remains at enmity with the law as holy, ju&s;t and good: he &s;ees not the &s;hape, and hates the character of God in his word, rejects the
<PB REF="012816_0003_0F8ABB1B90BA68E0">
kingly office of Chri&s;t; while he calls him Lord: and di&s;cards his law; while he &s;wears allegiance to his per&s;on. His faith is dead: his hopes are vain and delu&s;ive.</P>
<P>Some of the mo&s;t profoundly ignorant <HI>Legali&s;ts,</HI> and of the mo&s;t elated cla&s;s of Antinomians, have in time attained to a fancied &s;inle&s;s perfection, which is gotten by lo&s;ing &s;ight of the law; for <HI>where no law is there is no tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion:</HI> hence they are bold to &s;ay, they have no &s;in, and &s;o deceive them&s;elves, and &s;hew to all &s;en&s;ible people, that the truth is not in them.</P>
<P>Some have found a way to build them&s;elves up in mo&s;t of the&s;e delu&s;ions, by only a mere belief of the &s;imple truth of the go&s;pel propo&s;itions, without the lea&s;t &s;hadow of the compli|ance of the will, or with the heart believing unto righteou&s;|ne&s;s. Re&s;pecting both the&s;e denominations the one of which &s;plits upon the rock of &s;alvation, and the other &s;ucks poi&s;on out of the balm of Gilead, we may &s;ay to all the real di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t, di&s;tingui&s;hed by having the moral law and te&s;timony of God bound and &s;ealed in their hearts; <HI>ye have not &s;o learned Chri&s;t, if &s;o be ye have heard him, and been taught by him, as the truth is in Je&s;us.</HI></P>
<P>The Legali&s;t and Antinomian &s;eem as directly oppo&s;ite to each other as the antipodes or poles of the world; yet are exactly agreed in <HI>e&s;&s;entials.</HI> The one places his chief con|fidence in his external duties; the other in his &s;uppo&s;ed attainments. The one is fully &s;en&s;ible of the importance of his good duties; the other has the inward feeling of his good devotion, and pious di&s;po&s;ition: both reject Chri&s;t and his perfect righteou&s;ne&s;s. In all their prayers for them&s;elves, their hearts mean, as did the Jews in their application to Chri&s;t for the Centurion; <HI>he is worthy, for whom thou &s;halt do this thing: for he loveth our nation, and hath built us a &s;ynagogue.</HI></P>
<P>The like devout and pious &s;train of the Pagans, in their addre&s;&s;es to their idols, we find in the writings of their poets, Virgil, Homer, &amp;c. <HI>We</HI> (&s;ays the holy apo&s;tle) <HI>are the

<P>The de&s;ign of the following di&s;cour&s;es will not be fru&s;trated, nor the labour lo&s;t, if they &s;erve, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, to guard us again&s;t tho&s;e two extremes, and point out to us the true plan of that chri&s;tian doctrine, which is in all it's branches according to godline&s;s, being every way adapted to aba&s;e the &s;inner, magnify the moral law, di&s;play the exceed|ing riches of unmerited grace, to extol the divine Redeemer in all his mediatorial offices, to in&s;pire with inherent holine&s;s, and engage us to the practice of all &s;erious piety.</P>
<P>It is humbly hoped, that every pious, devout, and candid reader, that is con&s;cientiou&s;ly and cordially willing to live and die by the &s;entiments in the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es, will kindly overlook any tautologies, want of laboured periods, or proper arrangements; and make all fit allowances for &s;ermons delivered, according as, after eating the roll, a door of utterance was opened, to a con&s;iderable audience indeed of people of this and the neigh|bouring towns, but without a thought of their thus coming abroad; &s;eeing three months elap&s;ed (till &s;ome other things intervened) before the &s;ub&s;cription and motion for printing them took place; and that they are as ellaborate as may be rea&s;onably expected, being modelled but once in ha&s;te, without lei&s;ure to refine the &s;entiments or poli&s;h the expre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>That we may all know and practi&s;e the truth both of the law of faith, and moral law, and neither make &s;hipwreck of faith, nor of a good con&s;cience, but keep them both inviolate unto the end and &s;o be &s;aved, is the prayer of</P>

<P>AS in the adorable Trinity there are three per&s;ons, Father, Son and Holy Gho&s;t, in nature coe&s;&s;en|tial, in dignity coequal, and in being coeternal; &s;o they perfectly unite and co-operate in all the works of creation, providence, and grace. <HI>My Father work|eth hitherto, and I work.</HI> Whatever the Father doth, the Son doth the &s;ame likewi&s;e. The word for God, Gen. i. 1. is plural, and includes all the per&s;ons in the Godhead, who &s;aid one to the other, <HI>Let us make man,</HI> &amp;c. Chri&s;t, the e&s;&s;ential word or wi&s;dom of God, was pre&s;ent when the hea|vens were prepared; and the &s;oundations of the earth were laid: and <HI>by him were all things created, vi&s;ible and invi&s;ible, whether they be thrones or dominions, principalities or powers: all things were created by him, and for him.</HI> The holy Spirit moved al&s;o on the face of the waters in the creation; as the &s;ame Spirit of the Lord afterwards cau&s;ed I&s;rael to re&s;t in Canaan; and by his Spirit he garni&s;hed the heavens, and by the finger, i. e. by the Spirit of God, was the moral law written on the two tables of &s;tone. The whole Bible is the revelation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which God the Father gave unto him; and is all by the in&s;piration of the holy Gho&s;t. In all the di&s;pen&s;ations of grace in the go&s;pel we have <HI>the kindne&s;s and love of God</HI> the Father&punc; <HI>our Saviour,</HI> the <HI>renewing of the holy Gho&s;t, &s;hed on us abundantly through Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>

<P>Although &s;ome kind of imperfection is intimated, yet, if we rightly con&s;ider, we &s;hall find none to his di&s;honour, none but what aro&s;e from the perfection of God, his rectoral righteou&s;ne&s;s, the maje&s;ty of the law, and the nature of things.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="1">1. There was not the lea&s;t want of perfection in him as God. To him all divine attributes, and all the peculiar works of God are a&s;cribed. His name is <HI>Jehovah our righteou&s;ne&s;s: The I am that I am,</HI> the &s;elf-exi&s;tent, ever be|ing One; the omni&s;cient, omnipre&s;ent, almighty One, dwell|ing in his own eternity, or inhabiting the whole of eternity, pa&s;t and to come, in one eternal <HI>NOW. He ruleth by his power forever.</HI> He gloriou&s;ly rideth on the heavens by his name <HI>JAH. and in his excellency thro' the &s;ky.</HI> He treadeth on the waves of the &s;ea, and <HI>knoweth the balancings of the clouds,</HI> tho&s;e &s;tupendous works of God. He ruleth the raging of the &s;ea, and &s;u&s;taineth the whole creation. In the
<PB N="3" REF="012816_0005_0F8ABB1D0D187678">
beginning he laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the work of his hands. He is, and ever was, <HI>in the form of God, and it was no robbery for him to be equal with God,</HI> and &s;ays, <HI>I and my Father are one</HI> divine e&s;&s;ence. Chri&s;t is not (as the Socinians vainly imagine) merely a de|legated God, but God by nature, begotten of the Father before all worlds; tho' no man or angel can declare his generation. As God, he receives the adorations of Angels, and no di&s;pute ever aro&s;e in heaven about his divinity, among elect angels or &s;aints. Chri&s;t is perfect God, not made, &s;upreme, independent. God over all, rich unto all that call upon him. This is his name and memorial in all generations.</P>
<P N="2">2. There is no want of perfection in him as man. So far is the human nature of Chri&s;t from the lea&s;t deficiency, that in him it has the highe&s;t perfection it is capable of. A Lamb without the lea&s;t blemi&s;h, natural or moral. That was an holy thing, that was born of the virgin Mary, and is called <HI>the</HI> Son of God, begotten by the creating power of the holy Gho&s;t. <HI>The Lord created a new thing in the earth, a woman</HI> compa&s;&s;ed <HI>a man.</HI> He is God's holy child Je&s;us, who knew no &s;in, neither was guile found in his mouth; but was perfectly <HI>holy, harmle&s;s, undefiled, &s;eparate from &s;inners,</HI> and <HI>made</HI> in holine&s;s and dignity <HI>higher</HI> than the material heavens, which are not clean in his &s;ight, or than the holy angels, that are chargeable with comparative folly. His human &s;oul might in order of time, as well as by way of eminence, be the very beginning of the creation of God. And a body was prepared him with divine coun&s;el, as in the volume (or head of the book, Gen. iii. 15.) had been written of him, he is <HI>the</HI> very <HI>image of</HI> the <HI>invi&s;ible</HI> God, <HI>the fir&s;t-born</HI> of every creature, and in all things has the pre-eminence. The only vi&s;ible image that God ever made, or allowed to be made of an invi&s;ible mo&s;t pure &s;pirit. The human nature of Chri&s;t is the vi&s;ible effulgence of the divine glory, and the expre&s;s character of his &s;ub&s;tance, and will appear &s;o in the great day, when the man Chri&s;t Je&s;us &s;hall vi&s;ibly be &s;een with the power, glory and maje&s;ty of God; and that &s;hall be &s;aid of him
<PB N="4" REF="012816_0006_0F8ABB1E0ADACB18">
truly, which was of Simon Magus bla&s;phemou&s;ly, <HI>This man is the great power of God.</HI> In a word, the manhood of Chri&s;t is as glorious and holy, as may rea&s;onably be expected from the fulne&s;s <HI>of the Godhead dwelling bodily in him.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The God-man had not the lea&s;t imperfection in regard to his undertaking, but was completely furni&s;hed for it; and was the only per&s;onage in the univer&s;e that was &s;o. Had the talle&s;t mere Angel in heaven undertook to obey for us, be could have done no more than his own duty as a &s;ervant to the Mo&s;t High, nor could a mere finite creature have me|rited any thing by &s;uffering for us. If this Lord from heaven had not been perfect man, he could not have &s;uffered, and if he had not been perfect God, he could not have merited.</P>
<P>And if the union of the divine nature and human &s;oul of Chri&s;t has &s;ub&s;i&s;ted ever &s;ince, or rather before, time began, then was he well qualified to manage all the affairs of his church and people, even before his incarnation. Accordingly his goings forth have been from of old, even from everla&s;t|ing, in an human form, as a pledge of his coming in the fulne&s;s of time in the fa&s;hion of a man. He walked in the garden of Eden in the cool of the day; and afterwards appeared to Abraham as the God of glory, but in the form of a man. Thus Gen. xviii. 1, 2. The Lord appeared to Abraham, and he &s;aw three men; and when he met them, he could di&s;tingui&s;h Chri&s;t from the Angels (I &s;uppo&s;e by the Shechinah, or divine glory) as well as we can di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;un from the moon or &s;tars. This was that glory of the Lord that appeared in the pillar of a cloud and fire in the wilderne&s;s, and afterwards dwelt betwixt the <HI>Cherubims of glory,</HI> &s;hadowing the mercy-&s;eat, in the tabernacle and temple of old; and which departed from I&s;rael before the captivity, and never after returned.</P>
<P>This God-man was &s;een with bodily eyes by our fir&s;t parents, as the Lord God. By Abraham, I&s;aac and Jacob, as their God. Yea, Mo&s;es, Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, all &s;aw this God of I&s;rael at mount Sinai; and Mo&s;es after|wards &s;aw his back parts. Jo&s;hua &s;aw him, as Captain of the Lord's ho&s;ts, in all the conque&s;ts of Canaan. He was
<PB N="5" REF="012816_0006_0F8ABB1E0ADACB18">
&s;een by Gideon, as his commi&s;&s;ioner, and I&s;rael's deliverer. And it don't appear that there ever aro&s;e any di&s;pute among the &s;aints of old about the divinity or future incarnation of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>When the Jews &s;tumbled at the meanne&s;s of his appear|ance in the fle&s;h, they ought to have remembred his former di&s;coveries of him&s;elf in the days of their fathers. If his vi&s;age appeared to them marred more than any man's, and his form more than the &s;ons of men; they &s;hould have con|&s;idered that he had been &s;een of their great ance&s;tors as the God of glory; and that at mount Sinai, in the view of their fathers, his glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his prai&s;e. If they were tempted to &s;tumble at this King of Zion, his coming to them riding on an a&s;s, and on a colt the fole of an a&s;s; they &s;hould have recol|lected how he u&s;ed to ride on the heavens, and on a cherub for the help of his people. This God man was therefore completely furni&s;hed for the arduous work of our redemp|tion. He comes with all the bowels and tender mercies of a God, as well as the mo&s;t tender compa&s;&s;ions of a man, touched with the feeling of our infirmities.</P>
<P>Where then is the imperfection intimated? not in him as God, or man, or both; but only as a Saviour. If we may &s;ay without any reflection upon the glorious God (yea &s;ay to the honour of his adorable perfection) God cannot lie, nor deny him&s;elf, any more than cea&s;e to be; may we not &s;ay, that Chri&s;t, con&s;i&s;tent with the rights of the Godhead, the laws of government, that are a tran&s;cript of the moral attributes of God, could not &s;ave &s;inners without accompli&s;h|ing a work nece&s;&s;ary thereto? Thus far we may venture to affirm, that, when the coun&s;el of peace was betwixt the Father and Son, there was no propo&s;al made for our reco|very, but in the manner Chri&s;t undertook to accompli&s;h it. Men are &s;o far from any ability to &s;ave them&s;elves by any works of righteou&s;ne&s;s of their own, that it don't appear the Lord of glory could &s;ave them without working out a righteou&s;ne&s;s for them.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="012816_0007_0F8ABB1E8D085978">II. We are to con&s;ider, How he was made perfect.&mdash; By fini&s;hing the work which the Father had given him to do. By his obedience unto death, even the death of the cro&s;s.</P>
<P>If mode&s;ty forbids us ab&s;olutely to affirm, that infinite wi&s;dom could not have devi&s;ed other means for our &s;alva|tion, than by the death of Chri&s;t; yet we may &s;ay, <HI>It became</HI> (was decent, honourable and becoming) <HI>him for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many &s;ons unto glory to make the captain of their &s;alvation perfect through &s;ufferings,</HI> Heb. ii. 10.</P>
<P>And it is certain, that <HI>to this end Chri&s;t both died and ro&s;e, and revived, that he might be made</HI> mediatorial <HI>Lord both of the dead and living</HI>; and have <HI>authority,</HI> as mediatorial king, <HI>to give eternal life to as many as the Father hath given him.</HI> As &s;oon as he had done his work on earth, and could &s;ay, <HI>It is fini&s;hed; he bowed his head and gave up the gho&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>He had then full right, authority, and power by the co|venant of redemption to break the pri&s;on of the grave, for him&s;elf and people&mdash;to a&s;cend <HI>on high, and lead captivity captive, and receive gifts for men even for the rebellious; that the Lord God might dwell with them,</HI> and load them with his benefits. He had full power to &s;end the holy Spirit to carry on the work of grace, to &s;it as King forever, to com|mand Angels, and controul Devils, to have the key of David and reign over the hou&s;e of Jacob forever and ever; and to have power over all fle&s;h, &s;o as to give endle&s;s felicity to his people. He has entered by his own blood into the holy place above, as our advocate and interce&s;&s;or. He there &s;its a Prie&s;t on the throne of univer&s;al dominion, and can never be at a lo&s;s in any of his admini&s;trations; for <HI>there are &s;even lamps of fire burning before his throne;</HI> and he hath &s;even eyes, complete wi&s;dom and &s;kill, and &s;even horns of power to execute, and full authority to judge the world, and da&s;h all his enemies in pieces with his iron rod, and welcome all his redeemed to that kingdom he is gone, as their fore|runner, to prepare for them. Being thus made perfect, he is a complete, all-&s;ufficient Saviour, <HI>able to do, exceeding

By one offer|ing he procured for his people righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;trength, and all that is needful for their eternal happine&s;s; and in effect perfected all them that are &s;anctified. When this Son of the Highe&s;t bowed the heavens and came down to the du&s;t of death, all the mountains in the way of our &s;alvation flowed down at his pre&s;ence.

<P N="1">1.

Hereby he is made perfect, as the word <GAP DESC="foreign"> is rendered in the text, and in chap. ii. ver. 10. and chap. 7. ver. 19.</P>
<P>But as the word is con&s;tantly u&s;ed by the Seventy, Exod. xxix. and Lev. viii. for the con&s;ecration of Aaron and his &s;ons to the prie&s;thood, and rendered <HI>con&s;ecrated,</HI> Heb. vii. 28.

I am willing to vail to the authority of the&s;e learned criticks, which is &s;o far from militating again&s;t what is advanced above, that it abun|dantly confirms and corroborates it, that without &s;uffering Chri&s;t could not be a Saviour; &s;o far from it that he could not even be con&s;ecrated to that important office without it, and his very con|&s;ecration or dedication thereto con&s;i&s;ted in &s;uffering.</P>
<P>And all divines (as far as I know) will allow, that Chri&s;t could not enter into the mo&s;t holy place above, as a prie&s;t forever after the order of Melchi&s;edeck, i. e. abide a prie&s;t continually, as Melchi&s;edeck did hi&s;torically, from his a&s;cen&s;ion to the end of the world, without fir&s;t &s;hedding his blood, by the which he entered into that holy place, having by one offering, viz. of him&s;elf, obtained eternal redemption for us.</P></NOTE></P>

Our free-will offerings will never atone for wilful wickedne&s;s. <HI>Behold, to obey is better than &s;acrifice; and to hearken than the fat of rams.</HI></P>
<P>Here a weighty and important que&s;tion occurs. viz. What is that obedience that evidences our title to eternal &s;alvation? In general, it implies more than a reverence of the moral law, as re&s;ulting from the moral perfections of God, and con|taining the "everla&s;ting" tables of right rea&s;on and ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The light of nature, natural affections, and the eternal rules of righteou&s;ne&s;s in the moral law, are not vacated, but fully e&s;tabli&s;hed by the holy religion of Je&s;us: We mu&s;t never|thele&s;s obey Chri&s;t in obeying the moral law. He hath adopted it in the &s;ermon on the mount, and we mu&s;t receive it at his mouth as a perfect rule, in it's kind, for holy living to all his followers. Hence in regeneration he always writes his moral law in the hearts of his people, and puts his fear into their inward parts; that they may not wickedly or wilfully depart from him. All, that are converted into a notion of &s;alvation by grace, in contempt of the moral law, do &s;eparate what God hath joined, and deceive them&s;elves with a vain hope. The righteou&s;ne&s;s of the law mu&s;t <HI>be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the fle&s;h, but after the &s;pirit;</HI> &s;o far at lea&s;t, as with our <HI>mind to &s;erve</HI> this <HI>law of Chri&s;t,</HI> and love it, <HI>becau&s;e it is pure,</HI> and to <HI>delight,</HI> after the inward man, <HI>in</HI> this <HI>holy, ju&s;t</HI> and <HI>good law</HI> of God.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="012816_0010_0F8ABB20CAEBB720">We mu&s;t al&s;o believe and obey the go&s;pel, which is &s;tiled the law of faith, as having the force of a law enacted by the &s;upreme maje&s;ty.

We mu&s;t hearken to the whole form of &s;ound words in the holy Bible, and cordially entertain the gracious words that proceeded out of Chri&s;t's mouth.</P>
<P>All that fear God with a devout reverence and godly fear, and believe in God the Father, his perfections and glory; and believe al&s;o in Chri&s;t, as the Prophet, Prie&s;t and King of his church. and &s;ubmit to be taught, ruled and &s;aved by him, and unfeignedly repent and turn from all their tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions, tru&s;ting in Chri&s;t for pardon, and taking his yoke, being effectually per&s;uaded to come to him for life; the&s;e are the obedient in the text, and all de&s;cribe the &s;ame cha|racter. Call them believers, or fearers of God, or his obe|dient people, or the righteous, or godly, all come to the &s;ame thing. But to be more particular,</P>
<P N="1">1. Obedience mu&s;t be univer&s;al. None can properly be called obedient but &s;uch as are univer&s;ally &s;o. Not that they yield a perfect un&s;inning obedience; for &s;o, <HI>there is not a ju&s;t man upon earth that doth good, and &s;inneth not.</HI> And they that &s;ay, they live without &s;inning, do evidently <HI>de|ceive them&s;elves, and the truth</HI> of divine light and grace <HI>is not in them.</HI> But they &s;incerely aim to do all his command|ments, and practice his whole revealed will, having <HI>a good con&s;cience, willing in all things to live hone&s;tly.</HI> And as a <HI>good,</HI> hone&s;t hearted <HI>man</HI> is <HI>&s;atisfied from him&s;elf,</HI> i. e. in being con&s;cious to him&s;elf of his own &s;incerity and integrity in the whole of his duty; &s;o all will &s;ooner or later be a&s;hamed, that have not un&s;eigned <HI>re&s;pect to all God's commandments.</HI> James ii. 10. <HI>For who&s;oever &s;hall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all;</HI> as he thereby wilfully affronts the maje&s;ty, and de&s;pi&s;es the authority of the lawgiver, trampling on the law, and refu&s;ing, in one in&s;tance at lea&s;t, to have Chri&s;t to reign over him. Matt. v. 19, <HI>Who&s;oever therefore &s;hall break one of the&s;e lea&s;t

The Jews e&s;teemed that, which forbad the taking a bird and her ne&s;t, the lea&s;t of all the commands. But though it &s;eemed comparatively little unto them; yet it proceeded from the &s;ame authority as the greater commands of the law; and a Jew, that wilfully di&s;|regarded it, ca&s;t off the fear of God, di&s;owned his allegiance, and was verily a rebel.</P>
<P>How di&s;obedient then, and even rebellious, mu&s;t they be reputed, that omit the mo&s;t weighty matters of the law and go&s;pel? Such as the&s;e: <HI>This is his commandment, that we believe on the name of his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t: Thou &s;halt love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and thy neighbour as thy&s;elf. What&s;oever ye would that men &s;hould do unto you, do ye even &s;o to them: for this is the law and the prophets.</HI> What did the tythes of garden-herbs avail the Phari&s;ees, while they pa&s;&s;ed over the love of God, and ju&s;tice, mercy, and fidelity towards their fellow creatures?</P>
<P>In vain are a few external ob&s;ervances, while we are at enmity with God and his law, while anger re&s;ts in our bo&s;oms, and we carry grudges one again&s;t another. We mu&s;t e&s;teem his <HI>&s;tatutes concerning all things to be right, and hate every evil and every fal&s;e way;</HI> and walk in <HI>all the com|mandments and ordinances of the Lord blamele&s;s;</HI> and walk affectionately and charitably one towards another.

<P N="2">2. Our obedience mu&s;t be regulated by the &s;acred rules of holy living in the book of God. In particular, re&s;pect|ing the matter, manner, and de&s;ign of obedience.</P>
<P>The matter of our obedience mu&s;t be what our King and Lawgiver hath required of us. <HI>For &s;o hath the Lord com|manded,</HI> is our warrant for any duty.

in terms, it is acknowledged; and therefore may better &s;erve to &s;hew the affrontive ab&s;urdity of will-wor&s;hip, and the &s;etting up human inventions, <HI>the &s;tatutes of Omri,</HI> or our own &s;uper&s;titions, in the place of divine in&s;titutions. We may be &s;ure, that every thing will be utterly abhorred by the Lord of divine wor&s;hip, of which he can &s;ay, <HI>I com|manded it not, &s;pake it not, neither came it into my mind.</HI></P>
<P>Our obedience re&s;pecting the manner of it, mu&s;t al&s;o be regulated by the holy book of God. We mu&s;t love God, and &s;o keep his commandments from a principle of bene|volence, loyalty and love; <HI>obey from the heart that form of doctrine</HI> delivered unto us: <HI>My Son, give me thy heart.</HI> God requires truth and &s;incerity in the inward parts. He is a Spirit, and in his wor&s;hip bodily exerci&s;e profiteth little. <HI>They that wor&s;hip him mu&s;t wor&s;hip in &s;pirit,</HI> i. e. with the &s;oul, under&s;tanding, will and affections, <HI>and in truth,</HI> agre|ably to his word; with &s;upreme love, with devout affections to God and his whole revealed will. If the heart be right with God and &s;tedfa&s;t in his covenant, and there be a willing mind to do his will, it is accepted.</P>
<P>Moreover, our obedience, re&s;pecting our aims and ends, mu&s;t be guided by the &s;acred laws of righteou&s;ne&s;s. We mu&s;t ultimately regard the glory of God, and in clo&s;e connection therewith, and in &s;ubordination thereto, our views and aims mu&s;t be, in glorifying God, to enjoy him forever. We mu&s;t not de&s;pi&s;e the plea&s;ant land, but re&s;pect the recompence of reward in the future world; <HI>counting nothing dear to our|&s;elves, in</HI> compari&s;on with <HI>fini&s;hing our cour&s;e with joy.</HI> We mu&s;t &s;eek the honour that comes from God only, and with an holy ambition pur&s;ue the dignities and preferments of the world of glory, de&s;iring God in all things may be glorified thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t in our &s;alvation; giving God the glory of all his works of grace. This is to do more than others, and like Caleb, who was <HI>a man of another &s;pirit,</HI> to follow <HI>the Lord fully,</HI> or fill up after the Lord, as the margin reads it.</P>
<P>It is que&s;tioned, whether the mo&s;t refined hypocrite in the world hath advanced &s;o far as to pay even an external regard to all God's commands. Some wilful &s;in, or omi&s;&s;ion

of duty is allowed and connived at, which he calls an infir|mity, and &s;aith, <HI>The good Lord pardon his &s;ervant concerning this thing</HI>: but by not grieving for it, he proves it to be not an infirmity, but an allowed &s;in. So Naaman the Syrian, tho' &s;o much of a convert as to re&s;olve henceforth to <HI>wor|&s;hip no other but the God</HI> of I&s;rael, yet will externally practice and uphold idolatry, rather than give up his place at court.

Ahab after all his humbling him&s;elf, and going &s;oftly, doth not re&s;tore the vineyard of Naboth.</P>
<P>But if we allow the un&s;anctified to be never &s;o uniform and univer&s;al in external obedience, it will little avail them, &s;ince they all to a man fail in the other two, and come &s;hort of the glory of God. They &s;et the creature above the Creator: never &s;upremely love God, or aim at his glory. For want of the&s;e, how exact &s;oever their obedience may be in the matter thereof, it is at be&s;t but the &s;hell without the kernel, the carca&s;e without the life: and God is not plea&s;|ed or honoured thereby.</P>
<P>If we allow Jehu very punctually and exactly to have exe|cuted the letter, and matter of the divine command, in de|&s;troying the hou&s;e of Ahab; and that he was rewarded therefor by his &s;ons &s;itting on his throne to the fourth gene|ration; and all his boa&s;ting of his zeal for the Lord God: neverthele&s;s, becau&s;e he meant not &s;o, neither did his heart think &s;o, but it was in his heart to get a kingdom, and vent his pride and de&s;pite again&s;t tho&s;e he looked upon as his rivals; the righteous Judge makes inqui&s;ition for blood, and vi&s;its that blood of Jezreel upon the hou&s;e of Jehu, and cau&s;es to cea&s;e the kingdom of the hou&s;e of I&s;rael. For <HI>as he think|eth in his heart &s;o is he.</HI> The Jews fa&s;ting in Babylon four days in a year, during their &s;eventy years captivity, was in it&s;elf decent, proper, and, for the matter, good; but what do all tho&s;e fa&s;ts come to, before this one clo&s;e que&s;tion, brought home to con&s;cience? <HI>Did ye at all fa&s;t unto me? even to me?</HI></P>
<P>I&s;rael at mount Sinai (Deut. v.) &s;pake well, as to the &s;ub|ject matter, all that they &s;aid in their engagements to God:
<PB N="16" REF="012816_0012_0F8ABB224E897750">
but, <HI>O,</HI> &s;ays God, <HI>that there were &s;uch an heart in them.</HI> It was very ill in them, that <HI>they did flatter him with their mouths, and lied unto him with their tongues</HI>; that <HI>their hearts were not right with him,</HI> neither were they <HI>&s;tedfa&s;t in his covenant</HI>; and that in contempt of their own mo&s;t &s;olemn vows, they rebelled and vexed his holy Spirit.</P>
<P><HI>How can ye</HI> (&s;ays Chri&s;t to the Phari&s;ees) <HI>being evil &s;peak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth &s;peaketh.</HI> For the matter of it they might &s;peak well. The Devil, as to the matter of his &s;ayings, may &s;peak as well as an Angel. Mark i. 24.&mdash;<HI>I know thee who thou art,</HI> the holy one of God. And another, Acts xvi. 17.&mdash;<HI>The&s;e men are the &s;ervants of the mo&s;t high God, which, &s;hew unto us the way of &s;alvation.</HI> If we ob&s;erve only the &s;ubject mat|ter of the&s;e &s;ayings, we might imagine they dropped from the mouth of &s;ome holy Angel: but how do they appear, as proceeding from the heart of a Devil? They are there|fore ju&s;tly rebuked and ca&s;t out.</P>
<P>Hypocritical I&s;rael would draw nigh to God with their mouth, and honour him with their lips, but removed their hearts far from him. Thus Jeremiah complains to God of the Jews, <HI>Thou art near in their mouth, and far from their reins.</HI> What were all the pompous &s;acrifices of the Jews, the Searcher of hearts could &s;ay, <HI>I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. That, which crowns all true evangelical obedience, is the renouncing it all in point of ju&s;tification and acceptance with God. As unprofitable &s;ervants doing only our duty. Hence pre&s;ent our &s;upplications before the throne of grace, not <HI>for our righteou&s;ne&s;s, but for his great mercies, and for the Lord</HI> Redeemer'<HI>s &s;ake,</HI> and <HI>look for the mercy of Je&s;us Chri&s;t unto eternal life.</HI> Thus that pious Governor, Nehemiah, after all the good he had done, in &s;eeking the welfare of the children of I&s;rael, prays thus, <HI>Remember me, O my God, for good, and &s;pare me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.</HI> And holy David thus, <HI>Enter not into judgment with thy &s;ervant, for in thy &s;ight &s;hall no man living be ju&s;tified: If thou, Lord, &s;houlde&s;t mark iniquities: O Lord, who &s;hall
<PB N="17" REF="012816_0012_0F8ABB224E897750">
&s;tand?</HI> His heart was fixed, and fully e&s;tabli&s;hed to go on in every duty in the &s;trength of divine grace, and to make <HI>mention</HI> of the <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> of Chri&s;t, even of his only, as his plea for acceptance.</P>
<Q><L>"But when I &s;tand before thy bar,</L>
<L>The blood of Chri&s;t is all my plea."</L></Q>
<P><HI>Surely &s;hall one</HI> (and every true &s;aint) <HI>&s;ay, in the Lord (Jehovah our righteou&s;ne&s;s) have I righteou&s;ne&s;s and &s;trength. In him &s;hall all the &s;eed of I&s;rael be ju&s;tified, and in him &s;hall they glory. For a man to &s;earch his own glory</HI> in any of his good works, <HI>is not true glory,</HI> but to be <HI>poor in &s;pirit,</HI> and to &s;earch the glory of the grace and righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Medi|ator, and to <HI>tru&s;t in the mercy of the Lord forever</HI>; this is true glory, and will i&s;&s;ue in glory everla&s;ting.</P>
<P>La&s;tly. The improvement in a few inferences, and a word of exhortation to the obedient and di&s;obedient.</P>
<P N="1">1. We mu&s;t not divide the offices of Chri&s;t, nor take up with go&s;pel promi&s;es, in contempt of any of the laws, precepts, or ordinances of Chri&s;t. The Lord Je&s;us is anointed by the Holy Gho&s;t not only to be our atoning &s;acrifice, but al&s;o as a Prophet to reveal the mind of God, and teach, and lead his people into the green pa&s;tures of heavenly doctrine: and as the Captain of Salvation, as Leader and Commander, to conduct his I&s;rael thro' the wilderne&s;s of this world to the heavenly Canaan. If we &s;et a&s;ide one of his mediatorial offices, we reject the Saviour of the world, and neglect <HI>this &s;o great &s;alvation.</HI> For Chri&s;t will not be divided. They, that dream of happine&s;s by grace in Chri&s;t, and a tru&s;t in his righteou&s;ne&s;s, while they do not take the yoke of his com|mandments upon them, would do well to con&s;ider, that in the work of regenerating grace the moral law is written on the heart by the Spirit of the living God, and both the moral law, and te&s;timony of God, viz. the pure go&s;pel are bound and &s;ealed in the hearts of all his true di&s;ciples. Faith and obedience have &s;uch a connection, that the apo&s;tle u&s;es them promi&s;cuou&s;ly. <HI>Your faith is &s;poken of throughout the whole world. Your obedience is come abroad unto all men.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="012816_0013_0F8ABB23109AB798">Faith worketh by love. And <HI>if ye love me,</HI> &s;ays Chri&s;t, <HI>keep my commandments; for this is the love of God that we keep his commandments, and his commandments are not grievous</HI> to the inward principle of holine&s;s.</P>
<P N="2">2. Hence appears our need of a work of &s;anctifying, re|newing, converting grace. It is made known unto us by the witne&s;s from heaven, that every one of the human race is wholly depraved, to that degree, that no one of all the &s;pecies naturally <HI>under&s;tandeth</HI> his duty, or things &s;piritual, but <HI>they are all gone out of the way, and are together become unprofitable, there is none that doth good, no not</HI> &s;o much as <HI>one. We are not &s;ufficient of our&s;elves, &s;o much as to think any thing as of our&s;elves, that is truly good. In our fle&s;h there dwelleth no good thing.</HI> We mu&s;t then be <HI>his work|man&s;hip, created in Chri&s;t Je&s;us unto good works;</HI> and by a union with Chri&s;t derive &s;trength to obey him. He mu&s;t work all our works in us and for us.</P>
<P>He, that imagines him&s;elf able without the efficacious grace of Chri&s;t, to work out his own &s;alvation, and become willing and obedient to Chri&s;t, is, alas! a great &s;tranger to God, to the extent of his law, and the purity of go&s;pel pre|cepts, and quite unacquainted with him&s;elf, not knowing <HI>the plague of his own heart,</HI> nor how <HI>his whole head is &s;ick, and his whole heart faint.</HI> He knows not, that <HI>from the crown of his head to the &s;ole of his foot, there is no &s;oundne&s;s, but wounds and brui&s;es, and putrifying &s;ores; that have never been clo&s;ed, bound up, nor mollified with ointment:</HI> and never can be healed, but by the &s;acred <HI>balm of Gilead,</HI> and &s;ove|reign phy&s;ician there. All the loyal &s;ubjects of King Je&s;us are the trophies of his victorious grace, and are made <HI>willing in the day of his power.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. All, that <HI>are created anew in Chri&s;t Je&s;us unto good works,</HI> are &s;anctified in every part, and all the graces per|taining to the new creature are implanted in them. <HI>They have put off the old man, which is corrupt&mdash;and</HI> are <HI>renewed in the &s;pirit of their minds,</HI> and <HI>have put on the</HI> whole <HI>new
<PB N="19" REF="012816_0013_0F8ABB23109AB798">
man, which is renewed in knowledge, righteou&s;ne&s;s, and true holine&s;s, after the</HI> moral <HI>image of him that created</HI> the new man. Hence they fear God, and &s;tand in awe that they &s;in not, reverence his maje&s;ty, dread his di&s;plea&s;ure, and tremble <HI>at the words of the living God.</HI> They fear God even for his mercies, and tremble at his goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>They love his adorable perfections, and gratefully acknow|ledge the conde&s;centions of his grace, They love his law for its purity, and admire the whole plan of grace in the go&s;pel covenant. They love the people of God for the <HI>truth's &s;ake</HI> that is in them: and love <HI>the habitation</HI> of God's <HI>hou&s;e, the place where his honour dwelleth.</HI> They call the &s;abbath a delight, the holy of the Lord and honourable. They delight to <HI>behold the beauty of the Lord, and to enquire in his temple.</HI> They are <HI>merciful,</HI> in a mea&s;ure, <HI>even as their Father in heaven is merciful.</HI> Having hearts of fle&s;h, they love their enemies, and have their minds benevolent to all mankind. Having the fear of God before their eyes, they hone&s;tly endeavour to walk before God in uprightne&s;s of heart, in all the duties of a godly, &s;ober, and religious life. They <HI>e&s;teem</HI> God's <HI>&s;tatutes concerning all things to be right, and hate every fal&s;e way.</HI> And while they <HI>do good,</HI> they <HI>tru&s;t in the Lord,</HI> plead the merits of the Redeemer for the accep|tance both of their per&s;ons and works. And by faith in Chri&s;t, and patience in well doing, they inherit the promi&s;es, receiv|ing the end of their faith proved by their works, even the &s;alvation of their &s;ouls. 1 The&s;. v. 23. <HI>And the very God of peace &s;anctify you wholly: and I pray God your whole &s;pirit, and &s;oul, and body, be pre&s;erved blamele&s;s unto the coming of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Aiming to plea&s;e, honour, and glorify God, is e&s;&s;en|tial to all acceptable obedience. Not &s;imply our giving a cup of cold water to a di&s;ciple, but the giving it to him, as a di&s;ciple, and becau&s;e he belongs to Chri&s;t, entitles to the reward. So the receiving a prophet, in the name of a pro|phet, will &s;hew our title to a prophet's reward. It is the gracious re&s;pect to Chri&s;t in duty, that is plea&s;ing in his &s;ight.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="012816_0014_0F8ABB23DAFD9390">The Phari&s;ees gave alms to be &s;een of men, and verily they had their reward then in hand. For they were &s;een of men, which was the reward they coveted, and all they received. Tho' a good end will not &s;anctify a bad action, yet a bad end will always &s;poil a good one. <HI>As he thinketh in his heart, &s;o is he</HI> in the &s;ight of God. If &s;elf be our cen|ter, we <HI>fa&s;t for our&s;elves, eat and drink for our&s;elves,</HI> and do nothing to God, even to God. <HI>My &s;on give me thy heart.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. How great is the deceit of the Legali&s;t and Antinomian? The one &s;ets up the law again&s;t Chri&s;t; the other &s;ets up Chri&s;t again&s;t his own law. The one <HI>fru&s;trates</HI> the free &s;overeign <HI>grace of God,</HI> which &s;treams to us only in the blood of atonement, and by &s;uppo&s;ing righteou&s;ne&s;s cometh by the law, virtually &s;ays that <HI>Chri&s;t is dead in vain;</HI> the other <HI>makes void the law thro' faith,</HI> and repre&s;ents <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> as the <HI>mini&s;ter of &s;in,</HI> as if (with reverence be it &s;poken) the holy Je&s;us came not into the world <HI>to de&s;troy the works of the Devil, to condemn &s;in</HI> by his &s;ufferings <HI>in the fle&s;h, and &s;ave his people from their &s;ins,</HI> but to purcha&s;e a liberty to &s;in, and to <HI>continue in &s;in that grace may abound.</HI> Thus they turn <HI>the grace of our God into la&s;civiou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> and <HI>wre&s;t the &s;criptures to their own de&s;truction.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. The way to heaven now lies plain before us. The way of faith, and of the fear of God, the narrow way of holine&s;s. This is the King of heaven's high-way (I&s;aiah xxxv. 8.) in which we mu&s;t travel to the better country. <HI>Follow peace with all men, and holine&s;s, without which no man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord.</HI> All that faith is dead, that doth not purity the heart, and work by love; or that leaves the &s;oul de&s;titute of a principle of holine&s;s. All that embrace the promi&s;es in contempt of the precepts of Chri&s;t, and hope for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins through the mediation of our aton|ing Prie&s;t, while they trample on his kingly office, and will not have him to reign over them, are under a gro&s;s delu&s;ion. In all their &s;elf plea&s;ing, &s;elf-flattering dreams of life by grace in Chri&s;t, they only &s;uck the mo&s;t pernicious poi&s;on out of the balm of Gilead, and &s;plit upon the rock of &s;alvation.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="012816_0014_0F8ABB23DAFD9390">A word of exhortation, and we have done.</P>
<P N="1">1. To the unconverted, the unbelieving, the di&s;obedient, and gain&s;aying.

<P>&mdash;Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my la&s;t end be like his.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AS Caiaphas, the high-prie&s;t of the Jews, at the head of the Sanhedrin, in great pride, and ca&s;ting off the fear of God, and all pity, and in contempt of all the laws of ju&s;tice, honour, and &s;ound policy, was advi&s;ing to put to death the innocent and adorable Je&s;us to &s;ave the nation from the Romans; He, that made man's mouth, and in&s;tituted that &s;acred office, put &s;uch dignity upon it, as &s;o to overrule that he &s;hould utter one of the greate&s;t oracles in the world, and to prophecy <HI>that Je&s;us &s;hould die</HI> (as a &s;acrifice of atonement) both for Jews and Gentiles.</P>
<P>So Balaam, the great conjurer of the ea&s;t, having loved the wages of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, mu&s;ters (as we mu&s;t think) all the force of his inchantments to cur&s;e I&s;rael; but by the overruling power of I&s;rael's God that cur&s;e was turned into a ble&s;&s;ing. All his attempts were baffled, and he finds that there is <HI>no inchantment again&s;t Jacob, nor</HI> any <HI>divina|tion again&s;t I&s;rael.</HI> God will ble&s;s his people, and he can|not rever&s;e it. Let not the mo&s;t heaven-daring &s;inners, then, &s;ay, <HI>with our tongues will we prevail, our lips are our own.</HI> The an&s;wer of the tongue is from the Lord, and God can cau&s;e the tongues of men to fall upon them&s;elves. So far is he from cur&s;ing I&s;rael, that he ble&s;&s;es them alto|gether three &s;everal times. He prophe&s;ies their happine&s;s, and of the &s;tar out of Jacob, and of the ruin of Amalek the

fir&s;t, and of Antichri&s;t the la&s;t of the enemies of I&s;rael. <HI>So let thine enemies peri&s;h, O Lord.</HI> Such a &s;en&s;e has he of the felicity of I&s;rael, in covenant with God, and a people &s;aved of the Lord, that in a rapture he &s;ays, <HI>Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my la&s;t end be like his.</HI> Not barely when he dies, but he is willing now, in his pre&s;ent pang, to re&s;ign this mortal life, provided he might die as the righteous I&s;raelites, and like them be ble&s;&s;ed after death. Two things are here taken for granted, viz.</P>
<P N="1">1. That death is the end of all men. Balaam expects to die &s;ooner or later, and knows he cannot live always. <HI>It is appointed to men</HI> indefinitely <HI>once to die.</HI> Let men be good or wicked, they mu&s;t &s;hortly <HI>go the way of all the earth.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The immortality of the &s;oul, and the retributions of the future world. Balaam is &s;en&s;ible the I&s;raelites are ble&s;&s;ed in the felicities of another world after this, and that the congregation of evil doers are mi&s;erable in the invi&s;ible &s;tate, q. d. <HI>Gather not my &s;oul with &s;inners, nor my life with bloody men,</HI> but <HI>bind up my &s;oul in the bundle of life with the Lord:</HI> and may I &s;it down with Abraham, I&s;aac and Jacob, in the kingdom of God, and with all the true I&s;raelites indeed in|herit everla&s;ting life.

To which of the &s;aints will they not de&s;ire to turn? <HI>Give us of your oil, for our lamps are gone out.</HI> The rich man (Luke xvi.) with a lamentable and bitter cry begs for a drop of water to cool his &s;corched tongue, by the hand of that very Lazarus he had &s;lighted.</P>

<P>II. I am to &s;peak of the death of the righteous, in a &s;en&s;e that never entered into the heart of Balaam.</P>
<P><HI>The righteous peri&s;h,</HI> i. e. die a temporal death as well as others, <HI>and merciful men are taken away</HI> from this world, nor are the mo&s;t u&s;eful men <HI>&s;uffered to continue by rea&s;on of death. This is the end of all men.</HI> The mo&s;aic law made pro|vi&s;ion for clean&s;ing an hou&s;e infected with the lepro&s;y; it mu&s;t be taken down and removed into an unclean place. The body is the hou&s;e of the &s;oul, and, being defiled with &s;in, it mu&s;t be removed into the grave; and tho&s;e members of the body, that have been in&s;truments of &s;in, mu&s;t be meat for worms, and moulder in the du&s;t. The go&s;pel-covenant has made no provi&s;ion to &s;ecure his &s;aints from a temporal death. Although Chri&s;t be in them, the hope of glory, dwelling in their hearts by faith, and by his holy Spirit; yet <HI>the body is dead becau&s;e of &s;in,</HI> i. e. as good as dead, is a mortal body, and will &s;urely die at the time ap|pointed. For <HI>what man is he that liveth, and &s;hall not &s;ee death? Shall he deliver his &s;oul from the hand of the grave?</HI> That is the <HI>hou&s;e appointed for all living.</HI></P>
<P>The property of death, however, is changed, when it comes in the line of the go&s;pel-covenant. Hence we find death in the inventory of the believer's portion. <HI>All is yours, whether life or death.</HI> Death dive&s;ted of its &s;ting, is not what it once was. If a man keep my &s;ayings (&s;ays Chri&s;t) <HI>he &s;hall never &s;ee</HI> or <HI>ta&s;te death;</HI> never experience death in the bitterne&s;s of it, nor be held always a pri&s;oner to it; <HI>&s;hall by no means &s;ee</HI> or <HI>ta&s;te death</HI> forever, as the margin reads it. At the re&s;urrection death will <HI>be &s;wallowed up in victory. Precious in the &s;ight of the Lord is the death
<PB N="27" REF="012816_0017_0F8ABB27A80B30B0">
of his &s;aints,</HI> and <HI>precious</HI> &s;hould <HI>their blood be in our &s;ight.</HI> All, that are &s;incere upright walkers with God, at their death, do <HI>&s;leep in Je&s;us, enter into peace, and re&s;t in their beds</HI>; and their fle&s;h re&s;ts in hope of the re&s;urrection. They have a quiet repo&s;e in the du&s;t, where <HI>the wicked cea&s;e from troubling, and the weary are at re&s;t.</HI> Death to many &s;aints has been a plea&s;ant walk <HI>through the valley of the &s;hadow,</HI> not the <HI>&s;ub&s;tance</HI> of death, a valley low indeed, but fruitful with comforts. Death is the Jordan that divides the &s;aints from Canaan, but may be &s;afely pa&s;&s;ed under the protection of Chri&s;t, the ark of the new covenant, and is an inlet to glory. They that have &s;een the Lord's Chri&s;t, and &s;een, and waited for the &s;alvation of God, do freely give up the gho&s;t at the call of God, and <HI>depart in peace.</HI> They have <HI>hope in death, and peace in their latter end.</HI></P>
<P>But, what is chiefly in view under this head, is to teach the righteous how to die to the glory of God and their own everla&s;ting peace. They are &s;aid to die to the Lord, and in the Lord. They die in union with Chri&s;t, and in a covenant which death cannot di&s;&s;olve: thus dying to the glory of God, they honour God in a dying hour, &s;hew his &s;trength to the generation that &s;urvive, and leave their dying te&s;timony for God, and his holy religion.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;even things may be implied, viz.</P>
<P N="1">1. They call on God as their only hope and refuge in a dying hour. The &s;oul, now on the brink of eternity, and beyond the reach of all other helpers, looketh up to the heavenly hills, whence cometh all her &s;alvation, and to the Lord as the la&s;t re&s;ort in &s;uch a day of trouble. No &s;al|vation is hoped for from any creature. The be&s;t friends on earth are mi&s;erable helpers, and mi&s;erable comforters all. Therefore &s;ays the dying &s;aint, <HI>I will look unto the Lord, I will wait for the God of my &s;alvation, my God will hear me.</HI> They, that thus look unto the Lord, and call on his name, &s;hall be &s;aved. They, that with <HI>a good hope through grace,</HI> do look up to the compa&s;&s;ionate Redeemer for mercy and grace to help in &s;uch a &s;olemn time of need, will doubtle&s;s
<PB N="28" REF="012816_0018_0F8ABB288BE18100">
find mercy of the Lord in that day. They call on the Lord, and he heareth them, and delivereth them from all their fears. They look to him, and are lightened, and ea&s;ed, and their faces are not a&s;hamed. They receive &s;trength for their la&s;t combat; &s;o that the floods of great waters do not come nigh them, tho' Jordan may overflow all his banks. They are kept in the evil day, and are hid in <HI>the &s;ecrets of his pavilion</HI> from the terrors of the &s;hadow of death.</P>
<P>The prophet Jonah amid&s;t a thou&s;and deaths, and from the belly of hell, looked towards God's holy temple. The poor di&s;tre&s;&s;ed man cried, and the Lord heard him, and delivered him out of all his troubles. <HI>Look unto me, and be ye &s;aved, all the ends of the earth; for I am God, and there is none el&s;e.</HI> Rom x. 13. <HI>For who&s;oever &s;hall call on the name of the Lord &s;hall be &s;aved.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The righteous die to the Lord, and have inward peace, by &s;ubmitting to his will in going at his call. They own the &s;entence ju&s;t, that they <HI>return to the du&s;t, whence they were taken,</HI> and are obedient in dying, in a &s;weet re&s;ignation to it and to the declared and providential will of heaven. As &s;atisfied with life they can &s;ay, <HI>Lord vow lette&s;t thou thy &s;ervant depart in peace according to thy word.</HI> So Abraham (it &s;eems) yielded up the gho&s;t in a free and chearful &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the will of God, and was gathered unto his people. So <HI>Mo&s;es the &s;ervant of the Lord died according to the word of the Lord,</HI> or at the mouth of the Lord. He had earne&s;tly de&s;ired to go over and &s;ee <HI>that goodly mountain and Lebanon,</HI> but God bade him <HI>&s;peak no more of that matter.</HI> He had other work for him to do: he mu&s;t go up into the mountain and die. Mo&s;es is all &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the &s;overeign will of his ma&s;ter in heaven, is willing and obedient to the la&s;t moment. Thus he died to the Lord the death of the righteous. All the toils and &s;ufferings of the &s;aints are de&s;igned by God to pre|pare them for dying. That they may learn obedience by the things they &s;uffer, &s;o as at la&s;t to hold out in their faith in a dying hour. Tho&s;e that faint under le&s;s adver&s;ities, &s;hould con&s;ider what they &s;hall do in that evil day. Jer. xii. 5. <HI>If thou ha&s;t run with the footmen, and they have wearied
<PB N="29" REF="012816_0018_0F8ABB288BE18100">
thee, then how can&s;t thou contend with hor&s;es? and if in the land of peace, wherein thou tru&s;te&s;t, they wearied thee, then how wilt thou do in the &s;welling of Jordan?</HI></P>
<P>The unrighteous do not thus &s;ubmit to God. They may be &s;ecure, in&s;en&s;ible of danger, have no bands in their death, and like &s;illy &s;heep be laid in the grave, and &s;o lie down in horror and di&s;appointment forevermore. But if they have any &s;en&s;e of their danger, how far from an holy &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion! Their death is very &s;hocking and terrible. They are ar|re&s;ted, Luke xii. 20. (as the Greek is) <HI>Thou fool, this night do they require thy &s;oul,</HI> q d. The Bailiffs are now ready to &s;eize thee. Hence the &s;oul is haled away to the Judge, and delivered to the officer, and ca&s;t into pri&s;on. How amaz|ing was the death of Doeg! P&s;al. lii. 5, 7. <HI>God &s;hall likewi&s;e de&s;troy thee forever: he &s;hall take thee away, and pluck thee out of thy dwelling place, and root thee out of the land of the living. Lo, this is the man that made not God his &s;trength; but tru&s;ted in the abundance of his riches, and &s;trengthened him&s;elf in his wickedne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>The wicked are cut, or ca&s;t down in a moment.</P>
<Q><L>"Death! 'tis a melancholy day</L>
<L>To tho&s;e that have no God,</L>
<L>When the poor &s;oul is forc'd away</L>
<L>To &s;eek her la&s;t abode."</L></Q>
<P>They cannot retain their &s;pirit, neither have they power in the day of death, and <HI>there is no di&s;charge in that war.</HI> But they are as rebellious in dying as they have been in liv|ing, and are con&s;umed away as briers, thorns, or &s;tubble before a devouring fire, or they are driven as chaff before the wind.</P>
<P N="3">3. The righteous in dying de&s;ire rather to be delivered from &s;in, than out of trouble.</P>
<P>It is the temper of all the un&s;anctified to chu&s;e &s;in rather than affliction. Troubles and reproaches, poverty and pains in this world, &s;eem to them the greate&s;t evils. Hence it has been common in days of calamity for men to &s;eek death as the period of their troubles: and when they cannot find it, they do &s;ometimes <HI>bla&s;pheme the God of heaven, becau&s;e of their plagues and &s;ores, and repent not to give him glory.</HI> Hence all the real &s;uicide in all ages of the world.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="012816_0019_0F8ABB2A76F56D70">But though the righteous have a natural de&s;ire to get out of trouble, if &s;o is the will of God, yet they more earne&s;tly wi&s;h to get rid of indwelling &s;in, that body of death&mdash;that they may never &s;in, offend, and di&s;honour God&mdash;that Chri&s;t may never more be <HI>broken with their whori&s;h heart</HI>&mdash;and that they may no more vex and grieve his holy Spirit. Their language is, <HI>Take away all iniquity.</HI> They de&s;ire to be made perfectly holy, and to fini&s;h their &s;anctification in the fear of the Lord. Happy they that can &s;ay, <HI>As for me, I will behold thy face in righteou&s;ne&s;s: I &s;hall be &s;atisfied when I awake in thy likene&s;s.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. The righteous in dying have a gracious re&s;pect to the holy felicity of the heavenly &s;tate They regard not their &s;tuff in this world, when they have in their eye the good of that land of promi&s;e. They are willing to leave their deare&s;t friends in this world for better kindred in heaven. They <HI>have a de&s;ire to depart and be with Chri&s;t which is far better,</HI> having a re&s;pect to the recompence of reward. From an holy principle they de&s;ire an holy heaven.</P>
<P>And the chief thing in their felicity is to behold the King of grace in his heavenly beauty, and be before his throne; yet it is laudable in them, that they de&s;ire to &s;ee Abraham, I&s;aac and Jacob, and other &s;aints, in the kingdom of God; as al&s;o their acquaintance, which they may as well expect to know in heaven, as the apo&s;tles knew Mo&s;es and Elias, when they appeared in glory at the transfiguration on mount Tabor.</P>
<P>It is laudable for &s;aints to rejoice that their names are written in heaven, to &s;et their affections on things above, and run for the prize. The holy apo&s;tle knew, that if the earthly tabernacle of his body was taken to pieces, he had <HI>a building of God, an hou&s;e not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.</HI> Hence, he groaned earne&s;tly, de&s;iring that hou&s;e above. No matter how covetous or ambitious any are of the felicities and honours that come from God only. We mu&s;t not de&s;pi&s;e the plea&s;ant land, but look for the ble&s;&s;ed hope, viz. all the ine&s;timable benefits hoped for in the future world. Happy all the living or dying, that thus prefer heaven to earth, and things eternal to things temporal!</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="31" REF="012816_0019_0F8ABB2A76F56D70">5. The righteous die in charity with all the world. They forgive from their heart every one his brother their tre&s;|pa&s;&s;es. They breathe love, tenderne&s;s and benevolence to all mankind. They love their enemies, and wi&s;h their ever|la&s;ting welfare. They forgive, and &s;hall be forgiven. The &s;ame mind is in them, in a mea&s;ure, that was in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who prayed for his enemies, <HI>Father, forgive them, they know not what they do.</HI> So the fir&s;t chri&s;tian martyr prayed in great earne&s;t for his per&s;ecutors and murderers, <HI>Lord, lay not this &s;in to their charge.</HI> Such tender hearts are meet to be the ve&s;&s;els of mercy, and will have all their &s;ins blotted out, <HI>when the times of refre&s;hing &s;hall come from the pre&s;ence of the Lord. For if ye forgive men their tre&s;pa&s;&s;es</HI> (&s;ays Chri&s;t) <HI>my heavenly father will al&s;o forgive your tre&s;pa&s;&s;es.</HI> The &s;tout-hearted, the hard and unforgiving, &s;o dying, as they &s;hew no mercy, mu&s;t have none &s;hewn unto them. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are the merciful; for they &s;hall obtain mercy,</HI> and cur&s;ed are the unmerciful; for they &s;hall not obtain mercy. They that delight not in ble&s;&s;ing, it &s;hall be far from them. They that delight in cur&s;ing, it &s;hall come upon them. All men fare well or ill at la&s;t, as their temper is. If they are kind, tender hearted and forgiving, they will find God has bowels of mercy, while the men of &s;pite &s;hall reap vengeance.</P>
<P N="6">6. The righteous die in a &s;pecial tenderne&s;s for their &s;ouls. The &s;oul is their darling, the better part. They have little concern for their bodies, except that their fle&s;h may re&s;t in hope of the re&s;urrection to eternal life. The pomp of a funeral is not their de&s;ire, but that their &s;pirits may enter into peace and re&s;t, and that their precious and immortal &s;ouls may be delivered from the lowe&s;t hell. They are blind and in&s;en&s;ible indeed, that are careful, and troubled about many things re&s;pecting their bodies, their &s;leeping in the du&s;t; while the poor &s;oul is left to &s;hift for it&s;elf, and take a leap in the dark into the invi&s;ible world. The good part, which is the only portion for the &s;oul, is &s;lighted, and &s;o great &s;alvation neglected. They that are thus cruel and unmerciful to their own &s;ouls, are likely to be <HI>blotted out of the book of the living, and not</HI> to be <HI>written
<PB N="32" REF="012816_0020_0F8ABB2A990624A8">
with the righteous,</HI> and <HI>to have neither part nor lot</HI> in the world of glory. Prov. viii. 36. <HI>But he that &s;inneth again&s;t me wrongeth his own &s;oul: all they that hate me love death.</HI> All that &s;in again&s;t God, are &s;inners again&s;t their own &s;ouls; and they, that <HI>provoke the Lord to anger,</HI> do <HI>provoke them|&s;elves to the confu&s;ion of their own faces.</HI> But all the righ|teous, that regard the glory of God, and e&s;teem his favour as life, and his loving kindne&s;s better than life, will be tenderly affectionate to their own &s;ouls.</P>
<P N="7">7. The righteous die prudently committing their depart|ing &s;ouls to the care of the Lord Je&s;us. They know his name, and put their tru&s;t in him. They know he is a &s;afe hand, and that they may venture to appear in his righteou&s;|ne&s;s, even at the dread tribunal. They tru&s;t their &s;ouls with him, being fully per&s;waded that <HI>he is able to keep what they have committed to him again&s;t that day.</HI> So the peni|tent thief ventures his everla&s;ting all with Je&s;us, when he was crucified thro' weakne&s;s. <HI>Lord,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>remember me when thou come&s;t into thy kingdom.</HI> So Stephen, in his la&s;t &s;peech &s;ave one, <HI>Lord Je&s;us, receive my &s;pirit.</HI> Thus have the righteous courage and hope in their death, and peace in their latter end. They have <HI>boldne&s;s to enter into the holie&s;t of all by the blood of Je&s;us.</HI> Their hearts are fixed to tru&s;t in this almighty Advocate; and they &s;hall not be confounded. He is able to do exceeding abundantly: and will never fail nor for&s;ake any that put their tru&s;t in him.</P>
<P>Thus the righteous depart, honouring and glorifying God in their death, by dying unto him.</P>
<P>We proceed to con&s;ider,</P>
<P>III. The la&s;t end of the righteous.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t leave their bodies to &s;leep in Je&s;us, and wait in the grave all the days of their appointed time, till their change come in the re&s;urrection morn. God's covenant is with their du&s;t, and they &s;hall not be forgotten. That great promi&s;e, <HI>I will be to you a God,</HI> &s;ecures the re&s;urrec|tion, and eternal happine&s;s of their bodies. Let us attend to the departing &s;oul.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="012816_0020_0F8ABB2A990624A8"><HI>The &s;pirit returns to God that gave it.</HI> The &s;oul is no &s;ooner di&s;lodged from the dark lanthorn of the body, but it is life, and made perfectly holy, and receives the open vi&s;ion of the ble&s;&s;ed God. The &s;oul of a poor Lazarus is carried by the holy Angels into glory in as great honour and triumph, as was Elijah. Chri&s;t as mediatorial King has all the Angels at command. He is the ladder upon which they a&s;cend and de&s;cend to mini&s;ter in the kingdom of providence and grace. They receive the departing &s;oul, and convey it in honour and triumph to the man&s;ions above. And with what joy are tho&s;e everla&s;ting doors opened for their reception!

<P>And how great their joy in the day for the manife&s;tation of the &s;ons of God!

<P>We infer,</P>
<P N="1">1. That hope, that is built on Chri&s;t and none el&s;e, will &s;tand us in &s;tead in a dying hour. A good hope thro' grace, which di&s;po&s;es us to pur&s;ue holine&s;s, and purify our&s;elves even as he is pure, is the only hope that will avail us. If Chri&s;t be in us, the hope of glory, and we have this hope as an anchor of the &s;oul, &s;ure and &s;tedfa&s;t, which entereth to that within the vail, and fixes on the rock of everla&s;ting &s;trength; it will buoy us up amid&s;t the terrors of the &s;hadow of death. This hope will never make us a&s;hamed: and will i&s;&s;ue in the full fruition of the ever ble&s;&s;ed God.</P>
<P>But what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his &s;oul? Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh? Every hou&s;e (hope for heaven) built on any thing but Chri&s;t, is built on the &s;and, and will never &s;tand in the la&s;t &s;torm. They only will be &s;afe in the great day, that have made a covenant with God by the &s;acri|fice of Chri&s;t; all others make lies their refuge, and under fal&s;hoods hide them&s;elves; and virtually make a covenant with death, which &s;hall be di&s;annulled, and an agreement with hell, which &s;hall not &s;tand; when the overflowing &s;courge &s;hall pa&s;s thro' they &s;hall be troden down thereby.</P>
<P N="2">2. As men live &s;o they die, and as their way &s;o is their end. If men live under the guilt and dominion of &s;in, they die in &s;in, and their inquity &s;hall be upon their bones. If any are taking the broad road to de&s;truction, they are ha&s;tening to be undone. But they that &s;et their faces towards the hea|venly Zion, and walk in holine&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s all the days of their life, will be admitted into that <HI>new heaven and new earth,</HI> i. e. that eternal world, wherein dwelleth perfect righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace. <HI>The Lord knoweth,</HI> and approveth <HI>the way of the righteous, but the way of the ungodly &s;hall peri&s;h.</HI> They that go with the multitude to do evil, mu&s;t go with them to &s;uffer everla&s;ting evils in the future world.

John iii. 19. <HI>And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkne&s;s rather than light becau&s;e their deeds were evil.</HI></P>
<P>Balaam ri&s;ked and threw away his own life, in contempt of the revelations of God by his own mouth. The temper of his heart was again&s;t God and I&s;rael, and &s;o is his conduct: and we mu&s;t leave him to lie with the uncircumci&s;ed, and to have no portion with God, or with his people.</P>
<P N="4">4. All are righteous in their &s;tate by the ju&s;tifying righ|teou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, and inherently righteous by &s;anctifying grace, and practically righteous by holy living; or the con|trary to all the&s;e. The &s;criptures know of no people in the world, but the righteous and the wicked, him that &s;erveth God, and him that &s;erveth him not. There are no neuters in this world, nor purgatory in the other. <HI>He that believeth &s;hall be &s;aved, and he that believeth not &s;hall be damned.</HI></P>
<P N="5"><PB N="36" REF="012816_0022_0F8ABB308D6B8FE8">5. We mu&s;t all &s;hortly die the death of the righteous, or that of the wicked. <HI>This is the end of all men.</HI> And as the tree falls &s;o it will lie forever. As death leaves us &s;o judgment will find us.</P>
<P>Our life is but a vapour. Our days pa&s;s away as a po&s;t upon land, an eagle in the air, and a &s;hip in the &s;ea; the &s;wifte&s;t in the three elements. Now is our &s;eed-time, the harve&s;t is in the next world. And on this moment of time do hang the important concernments of the everla&s;ting &s;tate.</P>
<P>A few words by way of addre&s;s &s;hall conclude.</P>
<P N="1">1. To the unrighteous. Let me be&s;eech you to con&s;ider and turn to God now in your day of vi&s;itation. Learn to die while you live. Begin now to call upon God, to &s;ubmit to his will <HI>revealed</HI> or <HI>providential.</HI> Learn to hate &s;in, and love holine&s;s. Get a tender forgiving &s;pirit, and put your tru&s;t in the Lord. Make the Lord your refuge, &s;trength, and &s;hield, a very pre&s;ent help in trouble, that, like the righteous, you may have a place of refuge in the hour of death, and in the judgment of the great day. Con&s;ider what you &s;hall do in the evil day, and in the day of the de|&s;olation that &s;hall come from far: to whom you &s;hall flee for help, and where you &s;hall leave your glory. Had Balak given to a wicked Balaam his hou&s;e full of gold and &s;ilver, what would it have availed? <HI>Riches profit not in the day of wrath, but righteou&s;ne&s;s delivereth from death.</HI> You are now to chu&s;e your companions for eternity, either the Amalekites, the implacable enemies of I&s;rael, who&s;e end mu&s;t be that they peri&s;h forever, or the righteous and holy I&s;rae|lites, who&s;e end &s;hall be everla&s;tingly ble&s;&s;ed. <HI>Behold, now is the accepted time, behold now is the day of &s;alvation. To day if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. To the righteous. Beloved, you are to live all your days in &s;pecial reference to dying. If you live well, you cannot die ill. Endeavour to be thoroughly acquainted with all tho&s;e &s;even things to be exerci&s;ed in a dying hour. Never repine at the troubles of the world. Fear not reproaches.

God de&s;igns by the&s;e things to a&s;&s;i&s;t your faith in overcoming the world, by turning the world's mo&s;t dreadful artillery again&s;t it&s;elf. If the world is malignant, con&s;ider <HI>the world knoweth us not, becau&s;e it knew him not.</HI> All this is to reconcile you to <HI>the hou&s;e appointed for all living; where the wicked cea&s;e from troubling, and the weary are at re&s;t:</HI> and to humble you and prove you, that he may do you good in your latter end. Look to Chri&s;t as Jehovah your righ|teou&s;ne&s;s. <HI>Their righteou&s;ne&s;s is of me, &s;aith the Lord.</HI> Con&s;ider the recompence of reward, and count nothing dear to your&s;elves, in compari&s;on with fini&s;hing your cour&s;e with joy. And while the dying &s;inner looks up to heaven with terror and amazement, and looks to the earth, and beholds nothing but <HI>darkne&s;s, dimne&s;s of angui&s;h,</HI> and is <HI>driven into darkne&s;s;</HI> how joyful will you be at the hour of death, when you &s;ee the way into the holie&s;t of all by the blood of Je&s;us, and can hope in Chri&s;t, and in his word, and in a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of your own &s;incerity can &s;ay, as Hezekiah, 2 Kings xx. 3. <HI>I be&s;eech thee, O Lord, remember now how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy &s;ight.</HI>&mdash;And like the holy Apo&s;tle 2 Tim. iv. 7, 8. <HI>I have fought a good fight, I have fini&s;hed my cour&s;e, I have kept the faith. Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteou&s;ne&s;s, which the Lord the righteous Judge &s;hall give me at that day; and not to me only, but unto all them al&s;o that love his appearing.</HI></P>
<P>Ble&s;s God's I&s;rael, and &s;ee you do not grieve or offend the generation of his children, with whom you expect to live as brethren and companions in the kingdom of glory. Saints &s;hould live together in this world as Ruth with Naomi, Ruth i. 16, 17.&mdash;<HI>Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee: for whither thou goe&s;t, I will go; and where thou lodge&s;t, I will lodge: thy people &s;hall be my people&punc; and thy God my God. Where thou die&s;t, will I die, and there will I be buried.</HI>&mdash;You are together ha&s;tening to the better country; &s;ee that ye fall not out by the way. Con&s;ider the uninterrupted peace, and holy felicity of the world before you, and re&s;erved in heaven for you.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="012816_0023_0F8ABB32536D7AF0"><HI>Follow after righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> godline&s;s, faith, charity, and peace, with them that call on the name of the Lord out of a pure heart; and God will not gather your &s;ouls with &s;inners, nor your lives with bloody men. Chri&s;t will take you to him&s;elf. You &s;hall die in the Lord, be forever ble&s;|&s;ed, and re&s;t from your labours: and tho' your good works of righteou&s;ne&s;s will not go before you, to open the gates of paradi&s;e for your admittance, but you mu&s;t enter by the blood of Je&s;us; yet they will follow you as evidences of your faith and &s;incerity; and the rewards of grace will be according to your works.</P>
<P>Never let the &s;un go down upon your wrath, as you mu&s;t pray after the &s;un is &s;et; and prayers in wrath are written in gall: be&s;ides you may die at evening, and how can you think of appearing before the God of grace, expecting the forgivene&s;s of more than ten thou&s;and talents, while you have an heart to take your brother by the throat for the petty debt of an hundred pence. That mercile&s;s wretch Mat. xviii. dreamed of forgivene&s;s, and was as vi&s;ibly forgiven, as the righteous man, Ezek. xviii. 26, that turned from his righteou&s;ne&s;s, was apparently righteous; but the hardheartedne&s;s of the one and the gro&s;s wickedne&s;s of the other, di&s;proved their pretence, they are delivered to the tormentors. <HI>So</HI> (&s;ays Chri&s;t) <HI>likewi&s;e &s;hall my heavenly fa|ther do al&s;o unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their tre&s;pa&s;&s;es. But why do&s;t thou judge thy brother, or why do&s;t thou &s;et at nought thy brother? for we mu&s;t all &s;tand before the judgment &s;eat of Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Fear not the reproach of men, neither be afraid of their revilings; <HI>the moth &s;hall eat them up. Con&s;ider him that endured &s;uch contradiction of &s;inners again&s;t him&s;elf, le&s;t ye be wearied and faint in your minds.</HI> How &s;hall a Balaam, or any other, cur&s;e whom God hath not cur&s;ed? <HI>if God be for us, who can be again&s;t us? Who is he that will harm you if ye be followers of that which is good?</HI> that promi&s;e belongs to you: no man, or nothing &s;hall &s;et on thee to hurt thee. If God will own and ble&s;s, the cur&s;es of men are impotent; and God often requites his people good for the cur&s;ing of men.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="012816_0023_0F8ABB32536D7AF0">Die daily, con&s;ider your latter end, &s;ay <HI>to corruption thou art my father, to the worms thou art my mother, and my &s;i&s;ter. Come boldly to the throne of grace, that you may find mercy and grace to help in that &s;olemn time of need.</HI> Learn obe|dience and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to God by all the things you &s;uffer, re&s;pecting the times that are to pa&s;s over you in this changeable world, and re&s;pecting your great and la&s;t change. Do not murmur, repine or complain under the troubles of the world.</P>
<P>You &s;ojourn in a Bochim, a vale of tears, if not in Me&s;ech and in the tents of Kedar. Chri&s;t when on earth &s;et you an example by conforming to the climate. But let your groans and complaints be holy. <HI>O wretched man that I am</HI>! who &s;hall <HI>deliver me from the body of this death!</HI> re&s;pect the recompence of reward, and &s;et your affections on things above, and look for that city which hath foundations, who&s;e builder and maker is God. Carry no grudge, but put on charity which is the bond of perfectne&s;s.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider that <HI>anger re&s;ts only in the bo&s;om of fools,</HI> i. e. of wicked men; and our enmity to a fellow creature ri&s;es from our greater enmity again&s;t God. Be tender to your own &s;ouls, and now commit them to the Redeemer, to be ruled and &s;aved by him.&mdash;Thus by living to the Lord, you will learn to die to the Lord, and &s;o have hope in death and peace in your latter end. Rev. xiv. 13 &mdash;<HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are the dead which die in the Lord, from henceforth; yea, &s;aith the Spirit, that they may re&s;t from their labours; and their works do follow them.</HI></P>
<P>That we may all live the life, and at la&s;t die the death of the righteous, God of his infinite mercy grant, thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t; to whom with the Father and the Holy Gho&s;t, three per&s;ons and one God, be all honor, glory, power, might, maje&s;ty and dominion, henceforth and forevermore.</P>
