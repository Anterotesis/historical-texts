<HEAD>The <HI>Gifts</HI> of the SPIRIT to <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> con&s;ider'd in their DIVERSITY.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>I. Cor. xii. 4.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Now there are diversities of gifts, but the &s;ame <HI>SPIRIT.</HI></P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE words were &s;poken of tho&s;e <HI>extraordinary miraculous</HI> gifts, which various per&s;ons were endow'd with, for the good of the church, in its fir&s;t and infant &s;tate: But it is not my de&s;ign to con&s;ider the text in this view, but as it may, by way of accommodation, be applied to tho&s;e more <HI>common</HI> gifts, wherewith the mini&s;ters of religion have, all along, been, and are, at pre&s;ent, furni&s;ht, for the u&s;e of edification.</P>
<P>The method I propo&s;e is this,</P>
<P N="1">I. To take a view of the&s;e gifts in their <HI>diver&s;ity.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. To con&s;ider them as all proceeding from one <HI>and the &s;ame</HI> SPIRIT, though they are thus diver&s;e.</P>
<P N="3">III. To make &s;ome inquiry into the <HI>rea&s;ons of this various di&s;tribution of the&s;e gifts.</HI></P>
<P>The whole will then be followed with a plain and faithful Application.</P>
<P N="1">I. I am, in the fir&s;t place, to take a view of the <HI>gifts of mini&s;ters in their diver&s;ity.</HI> Says the apo&s;tle, <HI>there are
<PB N="6" REF="004913_0004_100E2ABA679D5F68">
diver&s;ities of gifts.</HI> And &s;o great is this diver&s;ity, that there are, perhaps, no two mini&s;ters, but if you compare their gifts, you will find a manife&s;t difference between them. Some have one gift, others another; &s;ome have more gifts, others fewer; &s;ome have greater gifts, others &s;maller: And among tho&s;e who excel in gifts, &s;ome excel in this gift, others in that, none in all; but he that excels mo&s;t in one gift, is yet excelled by another, in &s;ome gift of another kind, as great and valuable.</P>
<P>Some have the gift of applying to men's <HI>under&s;tandings.</HI> They have, in their own minds, a di&s;tinct perception of the truths of GOD and religion; and their talent lies, in a readine&s;s to &s;et the&s;e truths in a &s;trong and clear light be|fore others. A vein of &s;ound rea&s;oning runs thro' their di&s;cour&s;es. Their &s;ermons are well dige&s;ted, and well con|nected, and, in their general contexture, well adapted to inform the judgment, to open and enlarge the mind; and, in a word, to fill men with the knowledge of GOD's will, in all &s;piritual wi&s;dom and under&s;tanding. Such was the <HI>preaching</HI> of the <HI>great apo&s;tle of the Gentiles.</HI> He appears to have had an admirable gift in applying to the <HI>rea&s;on</HI> of men for their <HI>in&s;truction in righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> His <HI>writings,</HI> to be &s;ure, are all of them in the <HI>rational, argumentative</HI> &s;tile; calculated, not only to convey truth into the mind, but to do this in a way accommodate to <HI>men,</HI> by laying before them the proper evidences of it. And his <HI>preach|ing</HI> was of the &s;ame kind. 'Twas an addre&s;s to men's under&s;tandings, in the way of <HI>rea&s;oning.</HI> Hence the wri|ter of the <HI>acts of the apo&s;tles,</HI> when he would &s;peak of <HI>Paul</HI>'s <HI>preaching,</HI> expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf in that language, <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Acts 18 <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> <HI>He</HI> REASONED <HI>in the &s;ynagogue.</HI> Agreable whereto is that ob&s;ervable remark, in the preceeding chapter, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">V. 2.</NOTE> <HI>And Paul,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> HIS MANNER WAS, <HI>went in unto them, and</HI>&mdash;REASON|ED <HI>with them out of the &s;criptures.</HI> There never was a more <HI>clo&s;e, rationale, argumentative</HI> &s;peaker than the great St. <HI>Paul.</HI> It was his MANNER to REASON in his <HI>preach|ing.</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="004913_0005_100E2ABC094B70B8">
His chief <HI>natural talent</HI> &s;eems to have lain this way. He had been caught up into the third heavens; and if any man, he who had been &s;o exalted with revelations, might have &s;poken in raptures of zeal and flame: But <HI>his gift</HI> lay in addre&s;&s;ing <HI>rather</HI> to the <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> than <HI>pa&s;&s;ions</HI> of men; leading them into a clear and comprehen&s;ive knowledge of Divine things.</P>
<P>And an excellent gift this is. 'Tis well adju&s;ted to the character of men whom it has plea&s;ed God to endow with <HI>rea&s;on</HI> &amp; <HI>under&s;tanding:</HI> Nor is there a gift, the due exer|ci&s;e whereof, will more powerfully tend to an&s;wer the de&s;ign of making men wi&s;er and better, which ought al|ways to be the great end of preaching.</P>
<P>Others have the gift of <HI>moving the pa&s;&s;ions.</HI> Their voice is &s;trong, yet &s;weet and plea&s;ant. They have got the art of pronunciaton, can agreably modulate their words: and together with a good elocution, they have a becoming ge&s;ture; their action is ea&s;y and natural, and their general air graceful. They have the gift of the tongue, the faculty of expre&s;&s;ing them&s;elves in &s;o engaging a manner, as to command the attention and affection of their hearers. This &s;eems to have been the gift of the prophet <HI>Ezekiel.</HI> Hence he is &s;aid to have been <HI>as a very lovely &s;ong of one that hath a plea&s;ant voice, and can play well on an in&s;tru|ment</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ezek. 33.32.</NOTE>: To be &s;ure, this was the gift of young <HI>Apollos.</HI> He is &s;aid in the <HI>acts,</HI> to have been an <HI>eloquent man</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts 18.24.</NOTE>. i. e. a graceful &s;peaker, a man of an ea&s;y flow of words, one that could addre&s;s to his auditory in a moving manner. It was doubtle&s;s owing to this, the engaging way in which he &s;pake of <HI>the things of</HI> CHRIST, <HI>and of the kingdom of</HI> CHRIST, that he had &s;o many admirers in the city of <HI>Corinth.</HI></P>
<P>And a de&s;irable gift this is. It would not be mi&s;pent labour, if mini&s;ters took &s;ome pains to become po&s;&s;e&s;t of it. Not that 'tis po&s;&s;ible, after the utmo&s;t pains, that all &s;hould equally excel here; nature wont allow of it: but
<PB N="8" REF="004913_0006_100E2AC1FB894D70">
there are no preachers, but might attain this gift, in a le&s;s or greater degree. And however, in it &s;elf con&s;idered, it may be a gift le&s;s valuable than &s;ome others, yet there is no gift more recommending, or that will give what we &s;ay, the advantage of coming with more force, upon the <HI>pa&s;&s;ions</HI> of our hearers.</P>
<P>And let me add here, 'tis very proper the&s;e &s;hould be apply'd to. For the <HI>human pa&s;&s;ions</HI> are capable of &s;erving many valuable purpo&s;es in religion, and may to good ad|vantage be excited and warmed: always provided, that they are kept under the re&s;traints of <HI>rea&s;on</HI>; for otherwi&s;e they will &s;oon run wild, and may make tho&s;e in whom they reign to do &s;o too. <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>heat</HI> &s;hould always go together; and if there be not &s;ome good proportion of the former, it will turn to little account, if there be ever &s;o much of the latter.</P>
<P>Some have the gift of <HI>touching the con&s;ciences of &s;inners.</HI> They can &s;peak in words of terror, and &s;o &s;peak as to rou&s;e &s;inners out of their &s;ecurity, and &s;et them a thinking. They have a faculty at weilding the &s;word of the Spirit; and it is, often, in their hands, like a <HI>&s;harp two-edged &s;word, piercing even to the dividing a&s;under of &s;oul and &s;pirit, and of the joynts and marrow.</HI> This was the talent of <HI>John Bapti&s;t,</HI> the forerunner of our LORD. He came in <HI>the &s;pirit and power of Elias.</HI> And that was the genius of his mini&s;try, <HI>O ye generation of vipers! who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Now al&s;o the ax is laid to the root of the trees: and every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit, is hewn down, and ca&s;t into the fire. James the &s;on of Zebedee,</HI> and <HI>John his brother,</HI> were po&s;&s;e&s;t of the like gift. They were therefore &s;irnamed by our Sa|viour &dagger;, BOANERGES, or SONS OF THUNDER. They had the faculty of thundering out the vengeance of almigh|ty GOD again&s;t impenitent Sinners: And they dealt much in this way; it was probably the burden of their preaching.</P>
<P>And this al&s;o is a u&s;eful gift, if rightly managed. Says the in&s;pired <HI>Paul &Verbar;, we per&s;uade men by the terrors of the</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="004913_0007_100E2AC3ACAE85B8">
LORD. And they area proper means of per&s;ua&s;ion: To be &s;ure, they are propounded as &s;uch in the go&s;pel; and ought, accordingly, to be di&s;played before &s;inners. They &s;hould be plainly and faithfully told of that wrath of God, which is revealed from heaven again&s;t &s;uch per&s;ons as they are; yea, that they are, in their pre&s;ent &s;tate, under actual condemnation by the holy and righteous law of GOD, and in &s;uch circum&s;tances, as that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible but they &s;hould be mi&s;erable. And the terrors of GOD ought the rather to be &s;et in array again&s;t them, becau&s;e it is, in this way, ordinarily, that &s;inners are awakened out of their &s;ecurity, and put upon endeavours to get into a &s;tate of &s;afety re|&s;pecting another world. It is, being <HI>moved with fear,</HI> that they commonly begin their flight from the wrath to come. But then, it ought to be con&s;idered, that <HI>hope</HI> is a very powerful &s;pring of humane action as well as <HI>fear,</HI> and ap|plied to as &s;uch, every where in the go&s;pel. Not only is the danger, &s;inners are in, opened to their view; but the help likewi&s;e a merciful GOD has provided for them, in the LORD JESUS CHRIST; and as much care is taken to encourage their <HI>hopes</HI> as to alarm their <HI>fears</HI>: And what may be worth our remark, it is by the <HI>mixt influence</HI> of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, that &s;inners are effectually wrot upon to become true and real chri&s;tians. <HI>Fear</HI> without <HI>hope</HI> tends only to de&s;peration; nor will the &s;inner ever &s;uitably re|pair to GOD for help, till he is encouraged to hope in his mercy thro' the LORD JESUS CHRIST. Both the&s;e principles therefore are to be addre&s;s'd to; and a great deal of wi&s;dom is nece&s;&s;ary to direct us in our application to them, that they may not run People into the extreams of <HI>de&s;pair</HI> on the one hand; nor <HI>pre&s;umption,</HI> on the other; but may jointly operate, in a powerful manner, to bring them to repentance and &s;alvation.</P>
<P>Others have the gift of <HI>&s;peaking comfortably to di&s;tre&s;t &s;inners.</HI> Their words are meek and mild, full of tender|ne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion, and much &s;avouring of that mercy which is the di&s;tingui&s;hing glory of the go&s;pel. They have a dexterity in &s;etting before the view of &s;inners that
<PB N="10" REF="004913_0008_100E2ACC3385BE38">
<HI>loving-kindne&s;s of</HI> GOD <HI>in</HI> JESUS CHRIST, <HI>which has ap|peared towards man.</HI> They have a comprehen&s;ive know|ledge of that remedy GOD has provided for undone, mi&s;erable &s;inners, and their &s;kill lies in making application of this remedy; which they are able to do, &s;uting the con|&s;olations of GOD to the particular ca&s;es of tho&s;e, who&s;e di&s;|tre&s;&s;es they are acquainted with. This was the gift of <HI>Jo&s;es,</HI> who was therefore &s;irnamed by the apo&s;tles <HI>Barna|bas</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Acts 4.36.</NOTE>, which is, being interpreted, <HI>the &s;on of con&s;olation.</HI> He was one "eminent for comforting the LORD's Peo|ple, and &s;peaking peace to wounded, troubled con&s;ciences. He had an admirable felicity that way". And this was the gift of our ble&s;&s;ed SAVIOUR JESUS CHRIST: Not that he had not other gifts; for he was furni&s;ht with every gift befitting a preacher of &s;alvation; but he appears to have di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in the exerci&s;e of this. He could indeed, as there was occa&s;ion, &s;peak powerfully to the awakening of &s;inners; and his preaching was &s;ometimes in this &s;train; particularly, when he had to do with the <HI>&s;cribes</HI> and <HI>phari&s;ees.</HI> And never were the wo<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> of GOD denounced with &s;uch awful &s;olemnity, as when he uttered them again&s;t the&s;e accur&s;ed hypocrites, as you may &s;ee in the 23d Chapter of <HI>Matthew's go&s;pel.</HI> But his preaching was more commonly in words of mildne&s;s. He rather <HI>drew</HI> than <HI>drove</HI> men to him&s;elf. That was the &s;pirit of his di&s;cour&s;es, "Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy-laden, and I will give you re&s;t. Him that cometh unto me, I will in no wi&s;e ca&s;t out. If any man thir&s;t, let him come to me &amp; drink. How often would I have ga|thered you, as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, but ye would not. O that thou had&s;t known, even thou, in this thy day, the things of thy peace, but now are they hid from thine Eyes." Never was there the di&s;|covery of &s;o much compa&s;&s;ion to the &s;ouls of men, as in the preaching of the LORD JESUS CHRIST. He &s;pake with love and pity, &s;o as never man &s;pake. The tender|e&s;t and weake&s;t con&s;cience might have heard him without
<PB N="11" REF="004913_0009_100E2ACEE233C878">
fear. He would not have <HI>broken the brui&s;ed reed, nor quenched the &s;moaking flax.</HI> He was indeed <HI>anointed to preach good tidings to the meek, he was &s;ent to bind up the broken-hearted, and to proclaim the acceptable year of the</HI> LORD. So it was prophe&s;ied of the MESSIAH by the prophet <HI>I&s;aiah</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. 6.1.</NOTE>. And 'tis remarkable, our ble&s;&s;ed SAVI|OUR, while a preacher on earth, took up the <HI>book of this prophet,</HI> and having read to the people the words of <HI>this prophe&s;y,</HI> he <HI>preached</HI> to them, &s;aying, <HI>this day is this &s;cripture fulfilled in your ears</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Luk. 4.21.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>And there is not, perhaps, a more u&s;eful gift than this of being able to <HI>&s;peak comfortably to di&s;tre&s;t &s;inners.</HI> They need the con&s;olations of GOD; and 'tis a great mercy, there are tho&s;e among the preachers of CHRIST, who have an aptne&s;s to make application of them to their &s;ouls. 'Tis true, great care &s;hould be taken not to <HI>daub with untempered mortar,</HI> not to <HI>prophe&s;ie peace,</HI> when GOD has &s;aid, <HI>there is no peace:</HI> And tho&s;e, who have &s;kill in <HI>words of comfort,</HI> will be careful in this matter; and while they are &s;o, no preachers are more &s;erviceable; to be &s;ure, none are more like to the GREAT PREACHER <HI>of &s;alvation,</HI> who&s;e glory is was, to <HI>heal the broken in heart,</HI> and <HI>bind up their wounds.</HI></P>
<P>Thus <HI>various</HI> are the gifts of mini&s;ters. And I may add, their <HI>manner,</HI> in the exerci&s;e of the&s;e gifts, is as <HI>va|rious</HI> as the gifts them&s;elves. Some &s;peak in lofty &s;trains of language, others in a more plain and familiar way; &s;ome are clo&s;e and connected in their di&s;cour&s;es, others more loo&s;e and unconfin'd; &s;ome are flowing in their Style, others &s;hort and &s;ententious: Some are all zeal and flame, others more calm and compos'd; &s;ome utter them&s;elves in thunder, others in a &s;till and &s;mall voice; &s;ome are tender-hearted and affectionate, others appear more firm, and without much &s;en&s;ible emotion. But whatever variety there is in the gifts of mini&s;ters,</P>
<P N="11"><PB N="12" REF="004913_0010_100E2AD3ED2C3968">II. It all proceeds, which was the &s;econd thing, from <HI>one and the &s;ame</HI> SPIRIT. So &s;peaks the text, <HI>there are diver&s;ities of gifts, but the &s;ame</HI> SPIRIT. And in the fol|lowing ver&s;es, the&s;e gifts are particularly repre&s;ented in all that <HI>variety,</HI> in which they appeared in the fir&s;t days of chri&s;tianity: Upon which, the <HI>apo&s;tle</HI> makes that ob|&s;ervable remark in the 11th. V. <HI>But all the&s;e worketh that one and the &s;elf-&s;ame</HI> SPIRIT; <HI>dividing to every man &s;e|verally as he will.</HI> 'Tis true, the gifts here &s;poken of were <HI>&s;upernatural powers,</HI> &s;uch as advanc'd human nature above it &s;elf; enabling the per&s;ons endow'd with them to think, and &s;peak, and act, <HI>&s;o</HI> as it was impo&s;&s;ible for any man to do, who was not, as they were, immediately in&s;pired by the HOLY GHOST. But <HI>common</HI> as well as <HI>miraculous</HI> gifts come down from him, who is the <HI>giver of every good and perfect giving.</HI> The <HI>&s;elf-&s;ame</HI> SPIRIT endows mini|&s;ters now, that did it in the primitive &s;tate of the church&punc; The <HI>manner</HI> in which they are furni&s;ht with gifts may be different; but their gifts are &s;till <HI>his</HI>; the fruits of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> favour: He is the great Donor of them, in all their va|riety, whether in <HI>them&s;elves,</HI> or the <HI>mea&s;ures</HI> in which they are po&s;&s;e&s;t, or exercis'd.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t men, indeed, are too ready, when they ob&s;erve the difference there is in the accompli&s;hments of mini|&s;ters, to overlook the hand of GOD herein, a&s;cribing it to the different advantages they have been favoured with, or the different improvements they have made under the &s;ame advantages: And the&s;e things, no doubt, have their operation, in the place of means, in order to this <HI>diver&s;ity</HI> of endowments; but the <HI>Divine</HI> SPIRIT has, notwith|&s;tanding, the <HI>chief</HI> influence in this whole affair.</P>
<P>'This <HI>&s;olely</HI> from him, that mini&s;ters receive, what we call, their <HI>natural parts.</HI> They are by him, as the GOD of <HI>nature,</HI> form'd, and &s;ent into the world with all their <HI>natural abilities,</HI> both for <HI>kind</HI> or <HI>degree</HI>: And &s;ome he endows with <HI>greater,</HI> others with <HI>&s;maller</HI> capacities; &s;ome with this turn of mind, others with that; &s;ome with a large and extended genius, others with a more contracted
<PB N="13" REF="004913_0011_100E2AD8976E0C00">
one. And the&s;e <HI>natural gifts</HI> he <HI>divides &s;everally to every one,</HI> not according to <HI>their will,</HI> not with the concurrence of any power or endeavours of theirs, but according to <HI>his own &s;overeign plea&s;ure.</HI> And 'tis ob&s;ervable, the&s;e <HI>diffe|rent natural abilities,</HI> which are the gifts of GOD, in a &s;en&s;e &s;o free and ab&s;olute, that mini&s;ters contribute nothing at all to them, or the <HI>original ground</HI> of all that <HI>diver&s;ity</HI> there ever appears in their endowments; and this, tho' they &s;hould have the &s;ame education, and be placed under the &s;ame advantages, and make a like good u&s;e of them.</P>
<P>Not that the&s;e <HI>natural gifts</HI> an't capable of <HI>improvement.</HI> They may, by u&s;e and exerci&s;e, under a proper regimen, be greatly &s;trengthened and enlarg'd, refin'd and brighten'd; but this makes a difference only in the <HI>mea&s;ure</HI> of the&s;e gifts; they remain the &s;ame in <HI>kind,</HI> tho' different in the <HI>degree</HI> of their excellence. And yet even in re&s;pect of this <HI>acquir'd</HI> difference, there is more of the <HI>efficiency</HI> of GOD than we may generally imagine. For he it is that &s;o di&s;po&s;es things, in the cour&s;e of his providential govern|ment, as that there &s;hall be a concurrence of <HI>greater</HI> or <HI>&s;maller</HI> advantages for the improvement of the <HI>natural gifts,</HI> he has be&s;towed upon tho&s;e, he intends to employ as his mini&s;ters: And he may have a greater hand than we are commonly aware of, in influencing tho&s;e <HI>&s;ecret &s;prings,</HI> which put them upon tho&s;e various degrees of <HI>active diligence</HI> in the u&s;e of <HI>the&s;e</HI> advantages, in proporti|on whereto will be their acquirements.</P>
<P>There is yet another way, wherein <HI>the&s;e gifts</HI> may be improved; and this is, by <HI>grace,</HI> which is the highe&s;t and mo&s;t glorious improvement they are capable of. 'Tis by this they become animated with true chri&s;tian life and &s;pirit; 'tis by this they are directed to a right <HI>manner</HI> of exerci&s;e, and to a good <HI>end</HI>; 'tis by this they are render'd mo&s;t con&s;picuous in them&s;elves, and mo&s;t u&s;eful to the world. And need I &s;ay, that this improvement of the&s;e gifts, is, in the mo&s;t proper &s;en&s;e of all, to be a&s;cribed to the <HI>Divine</HI> SPIRIT? We all know, the appropriate Style of the SPIRIT <HI>of</HI> GOD, in the holy &s;cripture, is that, the
<PB N="14" REF="004913_0012_100E2ADC4F83D510">
SPIRIT <HI>of</HI> GRACE. And he is the <HI>grand di&s;pen&s;er</HI> of the grace of GOD to fallen man. 'Tis his <HI>&s;pecial</HI> office, in the oeconomy of man's redemption to &s;anctify both mi|ni&s;ters and people, their gifts as well as hearts. And when|ever the gifts of mini&s;ters are improved by &s;anctifying grace, whether it be in a &s;maller or greater degree, 'tis his work; and we are taught, from the bible, to a&s;cribe it to him, and give him the glory of it.</P>
<P>So that the endowments of mini&s;ters, whether <HI>natural</HI> or <HI>acquired</HI>; acquired by <HI>education,</HI> or <HI>grace,</HI> are properly <HI>gifts,</HI> the effects of the free favour of GOD. They pro|ceed, in all that variety, in which we behold them, from the one immen&s;e SPIRIT, as the author of nature, the over-ruler of all things in the cour&s;e of providence, or the di&s;pen&s;er of grace.</P>
<P N="3">III. But I mu&s;t now proceed, in the third place, to inquire into the <HI>rea&s;ons of this various di&s;tribution of gifts to mini&s;ters.</HI> And could no other account be given of the matter than that, <HI>even &s;o Father, becau&s;e &s;o it hath &s;eemed good in thy &s;ight,</HI> it would be enough to &s;atisfy every &s;erious, pious mind: But we have no need, in this ca&s;e, to recur to the <HI>ab&s;olute &s;overeignty</HI> of GOD; as though we were at a lo&s;s, and could only &s;ay with the apo&s;tle, <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Rom. 12.33.</NOTE> <HI>O the depth of the riches of the knowledge and wi&s;dom of GOD! How un&s;earchable are his judgments, and his ways pa&s;t find|ing out?</HI> Several things lies open to view, as weighty rea&s;ons of this various di&s;tribution of gifts. As,</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>glory</HI> it reflects upon the <HI>Divine goodne&s;s.</HI> An illu&s;trious di&s;play is hereby made of this attribute of GOD. Had the gifts of mini&s;ters been only few and &s;mall, this would have argued goodne&s;s in GOD; how much more now he has be&s;towed them in <HI>kinds</HI> &s;o various, and in <HI>de|grees</HI> &s;o excellent? There is an admirable beauty in this variety; and the goodne&s;s that has effected it, &s;hines forth with a glorious lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>Some, perhaps, may think, it would have been more for the glory of the Divine goodne&s;s, if all mini&s;ters had been
<PB N="15" REF="004913_0013_100E2ADFB2BC1150">
endowed with the &s;ame excellent gifts: And if the <HI>mea|&s;ure</HI> of gifts was that only which reflected honour on the goodne&s;s, which be&s;towed them, it might be thus; but it is far otherwi&s;e. 'Tis the glory of Divine goodne&s;s, in all its di&s;plays, to be under the direction of wi&s;dom, in con|&s;i&s;tence with holine&s;s and ju&s;tice. And 'tis this that has made way for tho&s;e innumerable <HI>different</HI> beings, with in|finitely various capacities, and for infinitely various ends and u&s;es, that we behold in the creation. It would have been <HI>glorious goodne&s;s,</HI> if GOD had made all beings with equal perfection, and capable of equal degrees of happine&s;s; but the beauty of the univer&s;e would then have been lo&s;t: To be &s;ure, there would not have been tho&s;e amazing contrivances of wi&s;dom, which now reflect a glory on all GOD's works of goodne&s;s. That goodne&s;s certainly &s;hines brighte&s;t that be&s;tows its gifts, not always to the <HI>utmo&s;t,</HI> as it were, by nece&s;&s;ity; but with tho't and de&s;ign, &amp; &s;o as &s;hall be&s;t an&s;wer the wi&s;e intentions of their be&s;tow|ment. This is the beauty of the Divine goodne&s;s in all its gifts; and 'tis particularly &s;o in tho&s;e conferred on mini&s;ters. They are, by being various, much better adap|ted to &s;erve the great and wi&s;e ends of their being furni&s;ht with them, than if they had been the &s;ame: Which leads me to ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="2">2. How admirably well adju&s;ted this <HI>various di&s;tribu|tion</HI> of gifts is, to the <HI>various di&s;po&s;itions</HI> of tho&s;e, for who&s;e benefit they are de&s;igned. It is not for their own advantage only, but for the <HI>good of people,</HI> that God be&s;tows his gifts upon mini&s;ters; and they are wonder|fully &s;uited in that variety in which he be&s;tows them, to promote this merciful intention. There is an ama|zing difference in the natural make of people. Some are of one temper, others of another; &s;ome of this con|texture of &s;oul, others of that. Some, from their origi|nal frame are apt to be plea&s;ed with one way of preach|ing, others with another, others with another &s;till, and &s;o on, according to the difference there is in that <HI>reli&s;h</HI> they bring into the world with them. The &s;ame gifts
<PB N="16" REF="004913_0014_100E2AE2E74CB310">
in mini&s;ters would not therefore be at all adju&s;ted to the&s;e various ta&s;tes in people; for which rea&s;on a good God has been plea&s;ed to vary his gifts: And the variety in the&s;e gifts is admirably fitted to the variety of gu&s;ts in people; in&s;omuch, that every palate may be &s;uited by &s;ome gift or other, whereby &s;ome mini&s;ter or other is di&s;tingui&s;hed. If &s;ome are apt to be wro't upon by that preaching, which has a tendency to let light into the un|der&s;tanding, there are gifts &s;uited to &s;uch a ca&s;t of mind; if others are better pleas'd with an addre&s;s to their pa&s;&s;ions, there are gifts adapted to work upon the&s;e; if &s;ome mu&s;t be alarm'd as with thundrings from <HI>Sinai,</HI> there are gifts form'd to &s;uch a purpo&s;e as this; and if others mu&s;t be drawn with the bands of love, in words of kindne&s;s and gentlene&s;s, there are gifts of this tendency al&s;o; And &s;o whatever the di&s;tingui&s;hing turn of mind is, it may be &s;u|ted among the preachers of &s;alvation; &s;ome or other of them are ble&s;t with a gift an&s;werable thereto.</P>
<P>And this rea&s;on of the various di&s;tribution of gifts, <HI>it's falling in with the various di&s;po&s;itions of people,</HI> is the rea&s;on not only &s;ugge&s;ted, but largely in&s;i&s;ted on in my <HI>context.</HI> The <HI>apo&s;tle</HI> here compares the <HI>church of</HI> GOD to an <HI>humane body,</HI> and the &s;everal gifts be&s;towed for its edification to the va|rious members of this body; all which have their u&s;e, and are nece&s;&s;ary in their place: And tho' &s;ome are more excellent, and &s;erve to a better u&s;e than others, yet all are &s;erviceable; in&s;omuch, that no one can complain of the other, and &s;ay, <HI>I have no need of thee</HI>: And 'tis by the united influence of the&s;e various members, &s;o variou&s;ly di&s;|po&s;ed, and &s;erving to &s;uch various purpo&s;es, that the exi|gences of the body, are, in the be&s;t manner provided for. The <HI>apo&s;tle's</HI> words are the&s;e, "The body is not one member, but many. If the foot &s;hall &s;ay, becau&s;e I am not the hand, I am not of the body, is it therefore not of the body? And if the ear &s;hall &s;ay, becau&s;e I am not the eye, I am not of the body, is it therefore not of the body? If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the &s;melling? But
<PB N="17" REF="004913_0015_100E2AE9F8DE4DC8">
now hath GOD &s;et the members every one of them in the body, as it hath plea&s;ed him.&mdash; And the eye cannot &s;ay to the hand, I have no need of thee; nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you." The application of this compari&s;on, the <HI>apo&s;tle</HI> him&s;elf gives us, in the 7th V. and onwards. "Now ye are the body of CHRIST, &amp; mem|bers in particular. And GOD hath &s;et &s;ome in his church, fir&s;t apo&s;tles, &s;econdarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healing, helps, goverments, diver&s;ities of tongues:" In which words is contained an enumeration of the various gifts, that then appeared in the church. The &s;um of the <HI>apo&s;tle</HI>'s arguing is this, That 'tis with the church, CHRIST's <HI>my&s;tical</HI> body, as with the body <HI>natural.</HI> Its nece&s;&s;ities are various, and require a va|riety of gifts, &s;ome of one kind, others of another; &s;ome of &s;uperior excellence, others inferior, according to the u&s;e they are intended to &s;erve; every one of which is needful in its proper place, nor could the exigencies of the church be &s;upplied without them. It would not have done &s;o well, if all gifts had been alike. Had the <HI>whole body been an eye, where</HI> then <HI>were the hearing?</HI> There is really need, con&s;idering the different make of men, that there &s;hould be different mini&s;terial gifts: And tho' in this va|riety &s;ome gifts will be <HI>&s;maller,</HI> and others <HI>greater,</HI> yet are the <HI>&s;maller</HI> equally nece&s;&s;ary in their place; nor would the real advantage of the church be &s;o well an&s;wered in any other way. <HI>Tho&s;e members of the body, which &s;eem to be more feeble, are yet nece&s;&s;ary</HI>; and the &s;ame may be &s;aid of gifts. Tho&s;e that are <HI>weak</HI> may yet, in their place, be as u&s;eful as tho&s;e that are <HI>&s;trong.</HI> For in the church of CHRIST, there are <HI>babes</HI> as well as <HI>grown men</HI>; and the former need <HI>milk,</HI> while <HI>&s;trong meat</HI> is more proper for the latter; as, <HI>by rea&s;on of u&s;e, they have their &s;en&s;es exerci&s;ed to di&s;cern both good and evil.</HI></P>
<P>In&s;tead then of finding fault, we have rea&s;on to admire that wi&s;dom of GOD, which has &s;o varied the gifts of mini|&s;ters, as to &s;uit the various di&s;po&s;itions of people. By this method of di&s;tribution, there are gifts adapted, not only to
<PB N="18" REF="004913_0016_100E2AED3367BE88">
plea&s;e all, but to work upon all, in that way, which is mo&s;t con&s;onant to their peculiar frame and make.</P>
<P N="3">3. I add, in the la&s;t place, as another rea&s;on of this <HI>va|rious</HI> di&s;tribution of gifts, that hereby opportunity is given for the <HI>tryal,</HI> both of <HI>mini&s;ters</HI> and <HI>people</HI>; of <HI>mini&s;ters</HI> to|wards <HI>each other,</HI> and of <HI>people</HI> towards <HI>mini&s;ters.</HI> Had the gifts of mini&s;ters been the <HI>&s;ame,</HI> there had been no room for tho&s;e of <HI>&s;uperior</HI> gifts, to have given evidence of their humility and mode&s;ty; <HI>e&s;teeming others better than them|&s;elves,</HI> and taking all opportunities to &s;peak of them and treat them with all due love and re&s;pect: Nor, on the other hand, for tho&s;e of <HI>inferior</HI> gifts, to have &s;hown, that they were not envious at the greater accompli&s;hments of others, but could rejoice in them, and heartily ble&s;s GOD for them; wi&s;hing that they might be <HI>greatly</HI> u&s;eful, in proportion to the <HI>greatne&s;s</HI> of their gifts.&mdash;Neither, if the gifts of mini&s;ters had been alike, would there have been opportunity, for <HI>people</HI> to have &s;hewed forth an <HI>impartial di&s;po&s;ition</HI>; thinking neither <HI>too highly</HI> of &s;ome, nor <HI>too de&s;picably</HI> of others; but entertaining &s;uch a ju&s;t tho't of all, as to be ready to gain advantage from all, without falling into contention and &s;trife, preferring &s;ome to the neglecting and contemning others. &mdash; But I may not en|large here. Enough has been &s;aid to ju&s;tify both the <HI>wi&s;|dom</HI> and <HI>goodne&s;s</HI> of GOD, in thus <HI>variou&s;ly</HI> be&s;towing his gifts on mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>The APPLICATION now remains. And it &s;hall be in &s;everal u&s;es, relative both to <HI>mini&s;ters</HI> and <HI>people.</HI></P>
<P>To begin with tho&s;e that relate to <HI>mini&s;ters.</HI> And,</P>
<P N="1">1. They may learn a proper <HI>temper</HI> and <HI>conduct,</HI> what|ever their gifts be, whether <HI>greater</HI> or <HI>&s;maller.</HI> Is it the priviledge of any to be favoured with a <HI>di&s;tingui&s;ht furni|ture</HI> for the work of the mini&s;try? They &s;hould look upon it as a free gift of GOD, and take heed, they be not elated with pride. There may be danger of this. The holy apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> had a <HI>thorn given him in the fle&s;h,</HI> le&s;t he &s;hould be <HI>exalted above mea&s;ure, thro' the abundance of re|velations.</HI> And pride was too commonly the fault, even
<PB N="19" REF="004913_0017_100E2AF1F5144990">
of tho&s;e, who, in the fir&s;t days of chri&s;tianity, were en|dowed with <HI>miraculous</HI> gifts and powers. They were too apt to be puffed up; entertaining &s;o high a tho't of them|&s;elves as to de&s;pi&s;e others. Hence that &s;olemn exhortati|on of the apo&s;tle, <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Rom. 12.3.</NOTE> <HI>I &s;ay, thro' the grace given to me, to every man among you, not to think more highly of him&s;elf than he ought; but to think &s;oberly.</HI> As if he had &s;aid, Don't en|courage too high an opinion of your gifts; don't be &s;elf-conceited and vain, putting an undue e&s;timate upon your own excellencies as greater than others; but <HI>think &s;oberly</HI> of your &s;elves. i. e. maintain a mode&s;t, humble &s;en&s;e of the gifts you have received of GOD: Tho' &s;ome under|&s;tand by <HI>this &s;obriety,</HI> as Mr. HENRY ob&s;erves, <HI>that &s;obriety</HI> which would keep them in their own place and &s;tation, from intruding into the gifts and offices of others; of which mode&s;t care, in the exerci&s;e of &s;piritual gifts, he gives us a noble example in the great apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> who did not <HI>&s;tretch him&s;elf beyond his mea&s;ure, nor boa&s;t, in ano|ther man's line, of things made ready to his hand</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. 10.13 to the 17.</NOTE>. And very ob&s;ervable is the argument, with which the <HI>apo&s;tle</HI> enforces this nece&s;&s;ary caution again&s;t pride in gifts. 'Tis couch'd in tho&s;e words, of this &s;ame ver&s;e, ACCORDING AS GOD HAS DEALT <HI>to every man the mea&s;ure of faith.</HI> And in the 6th V. where he &s;peaks of <HI>gifts differing</HI> AC|CORDING TO THE GRACE <HI>that is given to us.</HI> The tho't is the &s;ame with that in the text. <HI>There are diver&s;ities of gifts, but the &s;ame &s;pirit.</HI> And what con&s;ideration can have a &s;tronger influence to &s;uppre&s;s all undue elation of mind, on account of any advantages by &s;uperiority in gifts? <HI>What ha&s;t thou,</HI> O man of GOD, <HI>that thou did&s;t not re|ceive? Now, if thou did&s;t receive it, why do&s;t thou glory, as if thou did&s;t not receive it?</HI> Art thou the be&s;t, and mo&s;t accompli&s;ht mini&s;ter in the world? Thou art no more, thou art no better, than the free favour of GOD has made you. And the &s;ame good plea&s;ure of GOD that has di&s;|tingui&s;h'd you, might have di&s;tingui&s;ht others: nor can you a&s;&s;ign any rea&s;on of the difference between you and
<PB N="20" REF="004913_0018_100E2AF4F8103FC8">
them, but that, <HI>even &s;o, Father, becau&s;e &s;o it hath &s;eemed good in thy &s;ight.</HI> What ground is there then of glorying? How un&s;eemly is this? How unlike to the <HI>high prie&s;t of our profe&s;&s;ion,</HI> who was <HI>lowly in &s;pirit,</HI> tho' po&s;&s;e&s;t of gifts beyond mea&s;ure?</P>
<P>And what tho' your gifts are &s;uperior to the gifts of others? <HI>Their's</HI> may be nece&s;&s;ary; yea, in their place, and for the end de&s;ign'd in the be&s;towment of them, <HI>their's</HI> may be as u&s;eful as <HI>your's.</HI> The al-wi&s;e GOD &s;aw the &s;tate of his church to be &s;uch, as to need gifts of various kinds, &s;maller as well as greater; and they are all, in their place, equally conducive to the good of the body of CHRIST. Why then &s;hould they, who have greater gifts, de&s;pi&s;e tho&s;e who have &s;maller? Why &s;hould they under|value them? Why take advantage from their &s;uperior repute &amp; influence to le&s;&s;en their u&s;efulne&s;s in the church? What is this but to make a <HI>&s;chi&s;m in the body of</HI> CHRIST? What is it but for the <HI>hand</HI> to di&s;pi&s;e the <HI>foot,</HI> and &s;ay, <HI>I have no need of thee?</HI></P>
<P>But on the other hand, Is it the lot of any to be endow'd with <HI>fewer</HI> and <HI>&s;maller</HI> gifts? We have no ground of com|plaint, but the greate&s;t rea&s;on to be content. We have what an al-wi&s;e GOD tho't proper to give us. 'Twas he that divided to us this portion of gifts, and &s;hall we find fault with his di&s;tribution? "Shall not the SPIRIT of GOD do what he will with his own? May he not give to what per&s;ons he plea&s;es, and in what proportion he plea&s;es? One gift to one man, and another to another; to one more, and another fewer, as he thinks fit? Is he not the be&s;t judge, how his own purpo&s;es &s;hall be &s;erved, and his own donatives be&s;tow'd?" Let us be thankful we are what we are. If we &s;u&s;tain the place of a <HI>foot</HI> only in the <HI>body of</HI> CHRIST, let us not murmur, becau&s;e we are not the <HI>head.</HI> The &s;overeign GOD may certainly have liberty, to make us one or 'tother as plea&s;es him. And we &s;hould be particularly careful, that we don't envy others their &s;uperior gifts, nor do any thing to le&s;&s;en the good influence of them, duly exerci&s;ed. As 'tis for the
<PB N="21" REF="004913_0019_100E2AF9051C7CA8">
good of the <HI>body of</HI> CHRIST, there &s;hould be gifts of <HI>greater</HI> excellency, we &s;hould be thankful any are endow|ed with them, and not repine that we are not the per&s;ons.</P>
<P>My <HI>fathers</HI> and <HI>brethren,</HI> It is by this mutual chri&s;tian good temper and conduct of mini&s;ters, that they are to help forward the u&s;efulne&s;s of each other's gifts, for the common good: And 'tis really a matter, on which the intere&s;t of religion greatly depends, that they thus endea|vour to make one another as &s;erviceable as they can. Let me u&s;e here the words of the late excellent Mr. WILLIAMS in his <HI>convention</HI> &s;ermon, <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">See P. 14.</NOTE> <Q>Tho&s;e, &s;ays he, that are &s;trong &s;hou'd not de&s;pi&s;e tho&s;e that are weaker, nor the&s;e envy, or by any means ob&s;cure or le&s;&s;en the gifts of tho&s;e, who out&s;hine them; but &s;hou'd rather re|joice in them, and ble&s;s GOD for them. This is one way, wherein humility, the chiefe&s;t of chri&s;tian graces, &s;hould appear in us. How unworthy of mini&s;ters is it to &s;upplant, and depreciate one another? A thing that is very grateful to Satan and his in&s;truments, but di&s;honourable to CHRIST, and tends much to le&s;&s;en their u&s;efulne&s;s in the church.</Q> To the like purpo&s;e are tho&s;e words of holy Mr. FLAVEL; where &s;peaking of mini&s;terial prudence, in its exerci&s;e toward <HI>brethren</HI> and <HI>fellow-workers</HI> in the LORD; he &s;ays, this prudence <Q>will dictate and enjoyn it on us, that by the firme&s;t uni|on with them, we make their gifts and graces as u&s;eful as po&s;&s;ible for the furtherance and advancement of our great and difficult work. We cannot be ignorant, how much &s;atan hath gained, and CHRIST's intere&s;t hath &s;en&s;ibly lo&s;t by tho&s;e unhappy divi&s;ions and alienations among brethren, and fellow-labourers, in the work of the LORD. CHRIST hath &s;hed down a variety of a&s;|cen&s;ion gifts upon them, which are not capable of a full improvement, but in union and conjunction with each other. Gifts are improv'd in us by prayer &amp; &s;tudy, but the benefits of the&s;e gifts are &s;hewed among us by love and unity. Love and union bring EVERY MAN'S GIFTS AND GRACES INTO THE COMMON BANK, and in|&s;tead

of MONOPOLIES, they drive a free and open trade to the great enriching of the Church.</Q> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">See his works, vol. 2. P. 745, 746.</NOTE> He adds a little further onwards, <Q>When GOD has ca&s;t the lot of two or more fellow-labourers in the Go&s;pel, upon the &s;ame city, town, or neighbourhood, what a ble&s;&s;ed advantage have they, beyond &s;olitary mini&s;ters, to car|ry on the work of the LORD chearfully, vigorou&s;ly, and &s;ucce&s;sfully? Whil&s;t love cau&s;es their hearts to cla&s;p and clo&s;e, how mu&s;t their work be facilitated, &s;weetned and pro&s;pered in their hands? But if once jars and jealou&s;ies get in among them; if pride, envy or carnal intere&s;t di&s;&s;olve the bond of brotherly love; if in&s;tead of planting for CHRIST, they once begin to &s;upplant one another; no words are able to &s;hew, what a train of mi&s;chief and &s;ins will now break in among them, to the great di&s;honour of CHRIST, and ob&s;truction of the go&s;pel. I do therefore, &s;ays he, in the name of CHRIST, as upon my bended knees, ear|ne&s;tly intreat and be&s;eech my brethren, by all the re|gard they have to the honour of CHRIST, the &s;ouls of their people, their own comfort, or the &s;ucce&s;s of their labours, that no envyings nor &s;trifes, no &s;upplantings or detractions, be once admitted or named among them.</Q></P>
<P>I may not improperly add to what has been &s;aid, that mini&s;ters &s;hould be in a di&s;po&s;ition, no more to le&s;&s;en one another's <HI>graces</HI> than gifts. If the degrees of grace in &s;ome are greater than in others; If they have a more ar|dent love to CHRIST, and zeal in his &s;ervice; or would expre&s;s the&s;e things in a way different from what others chu&s;e to do, they &s;hould not herefrom entertain evil &s;ur|mi&s;es of their bretheren, as tho' they had no grace, no real love for CHRIST, or the &s;ouls of men; to be &s;ure, they &s;hould not &s;ay or do that which may have a tenden|cy to leaven the minds of people with fears and jea|lou&s;ies of this kind. It might alienate the hearts of people from mini&s;ters, and put it out of their power of being &s;o u&s;eful, as otherwi&s;e they might be; and what is wor&s;e,
<PB N="23" REF="004913_0021_100E2B00A5D5AF28">
it might end in all tho&s;e dreadful evils, which are the ge|nuine fruits of faction and contention. Tis true, where mini&s;ters have forfeited their character as men of religion, by a conduct di&s;agreable to the go&s;pel, it will be a &s;ervice, and not a hurt, to the cau&s;e of CHRIST, to repre&s;ent them as they are; but the ca&s;e is different, where the <HI>profe&s;&s;ion</HI> of mini&s;ters and their <HI>lives,</HI> agree with one another. They have a right, in this ca&s;e, at lea&s;t, not to be &s;poken ill of; and 'tis plainly a breach upon the <HI>great law of chri&s;tian love</HI> to cen&s;ure and judge &s;uch, or indeed &s;o much as to think evil of them.</P>
<P>And the &s;ame may be &s;aid as to <HI>&s;maller</HI> differ|ences in the <HI>&s;entiments</HI> of mini&s;ters; they &s;hould not, on this account, be out of all charity, de&s;pi&s;ing and condemning one another; there &s;hould not be heard among them names <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>To this purpo&s;e, is the following pa&s;&s;age in a letter of the mini&s;ters of</HI> New-England, <HI>to Mr.</HI> John Dury <HI>about his pacification, publi&s;h'd from the original copy, in the year</HI> 1664. <Q><HI>Epiphanius</HI> would not that chri&s;tians &s;hould have any <HI>By-name.</HI> Let the <HI>nick-name</HI> of <HI>Zuinglians</HI> and <HI>Calvini&s;ts</HI> then cea&s;e, the marks rather of <HI>faction,</HI> than of <HI>brotherly-union.</HI> What &s;hould we have to do with <HI>Luther?</HI> What &s;hould we have to do with <HI>Cal|vin?</HI> We profe&s;s the <HI>go&s;pel,</HI> we believe the <HI>go&s;pel.</HI></Q> <HI>This letter, as is declared in the</HI> preface <HI>to it, was returned with the &s;ub&s;cription of the names of allmo&s;t</HI> all <HI>the</HI> elders univer&s;ally <HI>in</HI> New-England.</NOTE> of reproach, which tend only to provoke and exa&s;perate.

but that good men &s;hould &s;ee many things in a different light. They always have done &s;o, and always will do &s;o.

Very excellent, to this purpo&s;e, are the words of one of the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> fathers of this country, I mean the pious Mr. HIGGIN|SON, &s;ays he, <Q>Let none &s;ay, that the&s;e or tho&s;e are di&s;af|fected to the cau&s;e of GOD and his people, becau&s;e they &s;ee not in &s;ome things as others do.

<P N="2">2. Mini&s;ters &s;hould con&s;ider, what their <HI>own proper gifts</HI> are, and be <HI>faithful</HI> and <HI>diligent</HI> in the u&s;e of them. Every mini&s;ter has his own gifts; and they are peculiar to him:<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See his <HI>election</HI> &s;ermon, preacht in the year 1663, pag. 21, 22.</NOTE>

He may be known and di&s;tingui&s;h'd by them. And as in the di&s;tribution of the&s;e gifts, the ble&s;&s;ed God knew which were be&s;t for this mini&s;ter, and which for that, and accord|ingly endow'd every one with his <HI>proper gifts</HI>; &s;o they &s;hould endeavour to know their own gifts, and not <HI>affect</HI> the u&s;e of the gifts of others. This is, virtually, to find fault with the divine di&s;tributions; 'tis a con&s;tructive declaration, that other gifts would have been better for us, than tho&s;e the alwi&s;e God has been plea&s;ed to furni&s;h us with: Nor will it, eventually, turn out to our own honour, any more than the advantage of the public. Tis obvious to a di&s;cer|ning eye, when the u&s;e of a gift is <HI>natural,</HI> and when <HI>affected:</HI> Nor can a man, ordinarily, exerci&s;e him&s;elf in any gift, &s;o well as that, which falls in with his natural turn and genius. Some mini&s;ters (tho' but few) are form'd for &s;udden &s;peakers; they have a quick tho't, and ready utterance: Others have no natural fluency either of thot's or words; and 'tis pity, &s;uch &s;hould &s;o mi&s;take their gifts, as to <HI>affect</HI> to be, and to do, like tho&s;e, they are, in their original make, &s;o different from. In&s;tead of envying the gifts of others by a vain &s;hew, that we are en|dow'd with them, we &s;hou'd rather con&s;ider, we have our <HI>own</HI> gifts, as others have <HI>their's</HI>; and that <HI>our's</HI> are as proper for us, as <HI>their's</HI> are for them. How prepo&s;terous would it be, &s;hou'd the <HI>foot</HI> attempt to act the part of the <HI>hand,</HI> or the <HI>ear</HI> the part of the <HI>eye?</HI> 'Twould tend to the confu&s;ion of the <HI>body natural</HI>; and it would bring the like confu&s;ion into the body <HI>my&s;tical,</HI> if mini&s;ters, leaving the u&s;e of their own proper gifts, &s;hou'd affect the u&s;e of the gifts of <HI>others.</HI></P>
<P>But what is of greater importance, mini&s;ters &s;hou'd be <HI>faithful</HI> and <HI>diligent</HI> in the u&s;e of their gifts. The apo&s;tle exhorts<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. 4.14.</NOTE>, <HI>neglect not the gift that is in thee.</HI> And he a&s;&s;ures us, in my context, that the <HI>mini&s;tration of the Spirit,</HI> i. e. in his various gifts, <HI>is given to every man to profit with all.</HI> i.e. that they may do all the good they can with their abilities. And indeed, what other valuable rea&s;on can be
<PB N="26" REF="004913_0024_100E2B0D3A6981A8">
a&s;&s;ign'd for the be&s;towment of mini&s;terial gifts? Surely, they were not given meerly for the honor &amp; advantage of tho&s;e that have them; no, but that the <HI>body</HI> of CHRIST might be <HI>increa&s;ed and edified.</HI> The <HI>body natural</HI> was not form'd with &s;o great a variety of members for mere &s;hew, but for real u&s;e; and wherein any member fails in this point, it becomes a burden. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of the <HI>body</HI> of CHRIST, the church. He has furni&s;ht it with pa&s;tors and teachers, and the&s;e with gifts of various kinds, and in various degrees: And why, not that they might be u&s;ele&s;s, but be bro't forth into exerci&s;e: Nor, unle&s;s mini&s;ters are active and faithful, in the u&s;e of their gifts, will they, in any tolerable mea&s;ure, an&s;wer the end of their being en|dow'd with them. 'Tis true, the way and manner in which mini&s;ters may think proper to expre&s;s their fidelity, in the exerci&s;e of their gifts, may be different; &s;o that one mini&s;ter ought not to be judged unfaithful, becau&s;e he does not, in all things, act as does another: Neither are the &s;ame improvements to be expected of tho&s;e, who have few gifts, as of tho&s;e who have many: But yet all ought to be faithful. Yea, tho&s;e, who have the &s;malle&s;t and fewe&s;t gifts, can give no rea&s;on, why they &s;hould not faith|fully employ them. The indu&s;trious improvement of our gifts, be they great or &s;mall, few or many, is ab&s;olutely required of us; nor unle&s;s we are faithful, &s;hall we do our duty to that body, of which we are members, or to CHRIST the common head of this body: Nor will any thing pre|vent his finally cutting us off, as members that are u&s;ele&s;s and unprofitable.</P>
<P>I &s;ay not the&s;e things to encourage any jealou&s;ies in the minds of people again&s;t mini&s;ters, as though they were unfaithful; &s;o far from it, that I would take this occa&s;ion to expre&s;s it as my real tho't, that the people, in this land, are ble&s;t with as faithful and diligent a &s;et of Pa&s;tors, as are to be found in any part of the chri&s;tian world. I don't mean, that there are no mini&s;ters, that may not be complained of for their negligence; but that, in the general, and as a body of men, there is rea&s;on for thankfulne&s;s, they are &s;o active and laborious in the duties

of their calling; and to repre&s;ent them as otherwi&s;e would be an unju&s;t reflection on them, as well as a denial of that grace of GOD which appears in them. But to proceed,</P>
<P N="3">3. Mini&s;ters &s;hould be cautious, le&s;t, under the pretence of <HI>depending on the</HI> SPIRIT, they &s;hould <HI>neglect that pre|paration,</HI> in the <HI>u&s;e of &s;tudy,</HI> which is <HI>really nece&s;&s;ary.</HI> The ble&s;&s;ed SPIRIT, 'tis true, is the great di&s;pen&s;er of all gifts, as well as grace. 'Tis he that furni&s;hes men for the work of the mini&s;try, and a&s;&s;i&s;ts them in it; and ought accord|ingly to be tru&s;ted in and depended on: But then, to|gether with this dependance, there ought to be the en|deavours of mini&s;ters them&s;elves, in the u&s;e of means. Their ca&s;e is different <HI>now,</HI> from what it was in the days of the <HI>apo&s;tles. That</HI> was the <HI>age of in&s;piration.</HI> Mini&s;ters were <HI>then</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;ted <HI>immediately</HI> from above, without any previous tho't or care of their own. They might then venture to &s;peak without premeditation, depending on the SPIRIT, to give them, in a <HI>miraculous</HI> way, what they &s;hould &s;ay. But the SPIRIT does not <HI>now</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;t mini&s;ters, as he did in tho&s;e times of <HI>extraordinary revelations.</HI> He does it in a way more <HI>humane,</HI> in the u&s;e of previous preparation by meditation and &s;tudy. And while mini&s;ters, in this way, depend on the SPIRIT for his a&s;&s;i&s;tance and ble&s;&s;ing, they may humbly hope he will be pre&s;ent with them to all the purpo&s;es, wherein they need his help: Whereas, they have no warrant to expect, he will make up for their neg|lects, by any miraculous de&s;cent upon them, as it were, <HI>in tongues of fire.</HI></P>
<P>This I would recommend to the con&s;ideration, parti|cularly of tho&s;e, who are <HI>candidates</HI> for the <HI>mini&s;try.</HI> There is &s;uch a thing, my young friends, as <HI>pre&s;uming</HI> upon the Divine SPIRIT, as well as neglecting to place a due dependance on him; and there may be danger in one as well as 'tother of the&s;e extreams. Avoid them both. Let your dependance continually be upon the Divine SPIRIT for all <HI>mini&s;terial gifts</HI>; but, at the &s;ame time, &s;o place your dependence, as not to think your own endeavours needle&s;s. You may not expect to be accompli&s;ht with

gifts, but in the u&s;e of labour and pains. You mu&s;t therefore mind your &s;tudies, be diligent in an attendance to reading and meditation, as well as prayer. And when you are, in this way, under the influence of the ble&s;&s;ed SPIRIT, furni&s;ht with &s;utable gifts, let me advi&s;e you not to think of venturing into the <HI>pulpit,</HI> without a &s;utable care to prepare your <HI>&s;ermons before hand.</HI> You ought not to expect <HI>immediate in&s;piration</HI>; nor may you depend upon the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of heaven, but in the way of previous diligent &s;tudy. You may, in this way &s;peak without your notes; but if this &s;hould be your choice, let it ever be from your <HI>memories,</HI> and not in the <HI>extemporaneous</HI> way. You can't well take too much pains about your &s;ermons; e&s;pecially, at fir&s;t, and 'till you have got form'd in you a readine&s;s to deliver your &s;elves in a clear and methodical manner: And even after this, you mu&s;t, ordinarily, &s;tudy before you preach, if you would &s;peak as becomes the <HI>oracles</HI> of GOD.

po&s;&s;ible. O how happy would it be, if this chri&s;tian good temper reigned univer&s;ally in people! O how much more profitable would the preaching of mini&s;ters be, than now it is! Their gifts, however various would then have their proper influence, without ob&s;truction, in doing &s;ervice to the body of CHRIST; and by this union in people, to gain ad|vantage by every gift for edification, 'tis inconceivable what would be the good ari&s;ing here from. &mdash;</P>
<P>But this <HI>variety</HI> in the gifts of mini&s;ters, as it is capable of much good, &s;o it is likewi&s;e of much evil. It may be turn'd into an occa&s;ion of emulation and &s;trife, faction and &s;ci&s;m. And alas! that this has &s;o often been the ca&s;e! It was &s;o, even in the days of the <HI>apo&s;tles,</HI> and in re&s;pect of tho&s;e mini&s;ters too, who were miraculou&s;ly endow'd by the HOLY GHOST. An unhappy in&s;tance of this, we have in the church at <HI>Corinth.</HI> The <HI>apo&s;tle,</HI> in his <HI>fir&s;t epi&s;tle</HI> to them, 3 chap. 3 v. complains, that there was <HI>among them envying, and &s;trife, and divi&s;ion.</HI> And in the follow|ing ver&s;e, he particularly acquaints them, with the ground of this complaint. <HI>One &s;aith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apolles.</HI> They had got, it &s;hould &s;eem, into par|ties, on account of the preachers among them; &s;ome cal|ling them&s;elves after the name of this preacher, &amp; others after the name of that: And each party &s;o admired the preacher they denominated them&s;elves from, as to hold the other (comparatively at lea&s;t) in contempt; the effect where|of was, tho&s;e emulations and contentions, which broke the peace of the church. The holy <HI>apo&s;tle</HI> was exceedingly grieved to &s;ee &s;uch a &s;pirit of &s;trife and debate prevailing among them; and very &s;everely rebukes them for it. He compares them to <HI>babes,</HI> v. 1. i. e. Per&s;ons that had grown to no con&s;iderable maturity in the <HI>&s;piritual</HI> life; yea, he pronounces them <HI>carnal. Whereas,</HI> &s;ays he, v. 3. <HI>there is among you envying, and &s;trife, and divi&s;ions, are ye not car|nal, and walk as men?</HI> And again, in the following ver&s;e, <HI>while one &s;aith I am of Paul; and another, I am of Appollos, are ye not carnal?</HI> As if he had &s;aid, "Your thus getting into parties, is a plain evidence of the remains of a carnal &s;pirit in you, that you are too much under the influence of corrupt pa&s;&s;ions and afflictions. From whence come <HI>va|riance,

emulations, wrath &s;trife?</HI> Come they not of <HI>men's lu&s;ts?</HI> They are certainly <HI>works of the fle&s;h</HI>: And as the&s;e appear among you, it's a &s;ure argument, if not of the <HI>power</HI> of <HI>carnality</HI> in you, yet at lea&s;t of its prevalence, that 'tis not &s;o much &s;ubdued in you as it ought to be."</P>
<P>And this is always the ca&s;e, when people take occa&s;ion from the <HI>different</HI> gifts of mini&s;ters, to contend with heat, and animo&s;ity; crying up &s;ome, &s;o as to reflect undue di&s;|grace on others. Not that people are to think alike of all mini&s;ters: By no means, &s;ome mini&s;ters are ble&s;t with &s;u|perior gifts, and people may undoubtedly prefer tho&s;e that are be&s;t gifted. There is no harm in this, nothing can be objected again&s;t it; 'tis indeed impo&s;&s;ible, they &s;hould do otherwi&s;e: E&s;pecially, ought they to prize and value tho&s;e mini&s;ters, who have been in&s;trumental of &s;piritual good to them. They &s;hould e&s;teem &s;uch highly in love, for the u&s;e GOD has made of them to their edification in faith and holine&s;s. But they &s;hould not prefer one mini&s;ter, be his gifts or graces ever &s;o great, to the di&s;paragement of ano|ther. 'Tis utterly a fault to de&s;pi&s;e this mini&s;ter, becau&s;e he han't tho&s;e endowments, another is favoured with. Shall <HI>Paul</HI> be &s;lighted, becau&s;e he han't the <HI>eloquence</HI> of <HI>Apollos?</HI> Or, <HI>Apollos</HI> be meanly tho't of, becau&s;e he han't the <HI>rea&s;on</HI> of <HI>Paul?</HI> Shall <HI>James</HI> and <HI>John</HI> be undervalued becau&s;e they can't &s;peak in the mild, &s;oft, tender manner of <HI>Jo&s;es?</HI> Or, <HI>he</HI> be treated with neglect, becau&s;e he can't utter him&s;elf in <HI>their</HI> words of thunder? This would be to bring confu&s;ion into the church of GOD. It would un|happily occa&s;ion that variance and &s;trife, which would eat out the bowels of true chri&s;tianity. It is, my <HI>brethren,</HI> according to the <HI>plea&s;ure</HI> of the <HI>Divine</HI> SPIRIT, that gifts are variou&s;ly divided to mini&s;ters; and 'tis really for <HI>your good</HI> that it is &s;o. Hereby you may all be pleas'd &amp; gra|tified. And if &s;ome of you are more pleas'd with one mi|ni&s;ter, others with another, and others with another &s;till, why &s;hou'd you pervert the good intention of a good GOD in the be&s;towment of the&s;e gifts, by mutual emulation and &s;trife? In&s;tead of needle&s;s debates, whether this, or the other mini&s;ter, is be&s;t qualified with gifts, you &s;hould ad|mire the wi&s;dom of GOD, in &s;o wonderfully adju&s;ting his
<PB N="34" REF="004913_0032_100E2B2C19CE8D58">
gifts to your various di&s;po&s;itions: In&s;tead of preferring tho&s;e of <HI>greater</HI> gifts, &s;o as to throw contempt on tho&s;e of <HI>&s;maller,</HI> you &s;hould endeavour to get all the good you can from them all. And let me &s;ay, there is no faithful mini&s;ter of CHRIST, be his gifts what they will, but you may reap advantage from them, if it be not your own fault: E&s;pecially, may you do &s;o, if you look upon mini&s;ters as they really are, nothing more than <HI>in&s;truments</HI> in the great affair of men's &s;alvation. The not attending to this may be one rea&s;on of the undue preference of mini&s;ters. The <HI>apo&s;tle</HI> in the ca&s;e of the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> in order to give check to this <HI>party &s;pirit,</HI> which appeared among them, applies to them in that language<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. 3.5, 6, 7.</NOTE>; <HI>Who then is Paul, and who is A|pollos, but Mini&s;ters by whom ye believed, even as the</HI> LORD GAVE TO EVERY MAN? <HI>I have planted Apollos watered; but</HI> GOD GAVE THE INCREASE: <HI>So then, neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but</HI> GOD THAT GIVETH THE INCREASE. The be&s;t preacher in the world, the mo&s;t moving and awakening, the mo&s;t rational and con|vincing, can produce no &s;aving change in the heart of any, but as a <HI>Divine power</HI> goes along with his endeavours. Nei|ther <HI>Paul,</HI> nor <HI>Apollos,</HI> nor <HI>Cephas,</HI> are any thing without God; and with the concurrence of his grace, mini&s;ters of inferior gifts may &s;peak effectually to the &s;alvation of their hearers. This &s;hould govern your e&s;timate of mini&s;ters; re|&s;training you from too high thoughts of the <HI>be&s;t,</HI> and too low ones of tho&s;e that are <HI>inferior</HI> to them. The <HI>former</HI> can't be the <HI>authors</HI> and the <HI>latter</HI> may be the <HI>in&s;truments</HI> of &s;anctification to you.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI> I &s;peak not the&s;e things with a de&s;ign to offend any; but becau&s;e they are a <HI>word in &s;ea&s;on</HI>: And whoever is not &s;en&s;ible of this, mu&s;t be unacquainted with the &s;itua|tion of affairs in this place. There has certainly been too much beat and &s;trife about mini&s;ters; &s;ome contending for one, others for another: And, I believe, no one will pre|tend to ju&s;tify tho&s;e hard &s;peeches, which have &s;ometimes dropt from the lips of tho&s;e, who, I would hope, are other|wi&s;e good chri&s;tians. If you prefer &s;ome mini&s;ters to others, yet don't &s;light tho&s;e, of who&s;e gifts, you have not &s;o high an opinion. If, in your apprehen&s;ion, they be men of inferi|or

gifts, they may not be &s;o in the tho't of others; they may have a great e&s;teem of their gifts; yea, and of their graces too: Don't do any thing to hinder their u&s;efulne&s;s to tho&s;e, who value them, tho' they &s;hou'd not be &s;o well fitted to be u&s;eful to you: Or, if their gifts are really &s;mall, they are &s;uch as GOD has given them, and they ought not therefore to be de&s;pi&s;ed: Be&s;ides, their gifts being &s;mall, their work is &s;o much the harder: Dont make it &s;till more burden&s;ome, by heaping upon them the occa&s;ions of grief &amp; di&s;couragement.</P>
<P>And bear with me, while I go on to caution you again&s;t <HI>&s;uch an itch</HI> after <HI>other preachers,</HI> as may lead you to for&s;ake your <HI>own mini&s;ters</HI> on the <HI>Lord's-day,</HI> to the breaking in upon the good order of the <HI>Town</HI>: And I the rather menti|on this, becau&s;e it has been taken notice of by the <HI>body of your mini&s;ters,</HI> who have more than once, come into an agreement among them&s;elves, not to a&s;k tho&s;e mini&s;ters to preach on the <HI>&s;abbath,</HI> who might be the occa&s;ion of your coming into &s;uch di&s;orders on this holy day. And this agreement has been generally approved of by the mo&s;t pious and judicious among us, &s;o far as I can learn.</P>
<P>I cannot more agreably clo&s;e this head than in the words of the late pious and excellent Mr. WILLARD <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">See his <HI>lectures</HI> on the <HI>catechi&s;m,</HI> p. 641.</NOTE>.

There mu&s;t be <HI>gifts</HI> as well as <HI>grace</HI>; and the&s;e too, attain'd in the <HI>common</HI> and <HI>ordinary</HI> way, by <HI>education</HI> and <HI>&s;tudy:</HI> Nor otherwi&s;e may it be thought, there are the <HI>needful</HI> accompli&s;hments for the <HI>work</HI> of the <HI>mini&s;try.&mdash; Grace</HI> and <HI>learning</HI> are no ways incon&s;i&s;tent with each other. And where <HI>mini&s;ters</HI> have <HI>grace,</HI> the <HI>greater</HI> their <HI>learning</HI> the <HI>more</HI> capable will they be, of be|ing <HI>mo&s;t eminently</HI> u&s;eful:&mdash; Nor without &s;ome <HI>good mea|&s;ure</HI> of <HI>learning,</HI> let the <HI>graces</HI> of any be what they will, are they fit for <HI>preachers</HI>;&mdash; and 'twill, in the end, prove a great di&s;-&s;ervice to the intere&s;t of religion, if people en|courage &s;uch to take upon them the employment of <HI>mini&s;ters.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>Your patience (which I have too far tried already) will allow me to add nothing more, but my hearty prayer, that the de&s;ign of GOD in be&s;towing his <HI>various</HI> gifts on <HI>mini&s;ters,</HI> may be effectually accompli&s;ht in you, in your <HI>all coming in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the</HI> SON <HI>of</HI> GOD, <HI>unto a perfect man, unto the mea&s;ure of the &s;tature of the fulne&s;s of</HI> CHRIST. To <HI>him</HI> be <HI>glory</HI> in the <HI>church,</HI> on <HI>earth</HI> and in <HI>heaven,</HI> forever and ever, Amen.</P>
