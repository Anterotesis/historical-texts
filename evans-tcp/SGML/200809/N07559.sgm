<HEAD>PLAIN TRUTH, Addre&s;s'd to the PUBLIC.</HEAD>
<P>AT a Time when we &s;eem to be rent in Pieces by PARTY SPIRIT and PARTY RAGE, I think it a Duty incumbent on every good Subject to make diligent Search, in order to find out the Agre&s;&s;ors, and then to in|form the Public how he has found Matters to &s;tand; that &s;o common Opinions may be confirm'd or refuted, and the Saddle at la&s;t be put on the right Hor&s;e, and Peace again re&s;tored among us.</P>
<P>FIRST THEN, Let us con&s;ider the Paxton Voluntiers, and others, again&s;t whom &s;ome make &s;uch an Outcry:&mdash; Shall we attempt to vindicate their killing Indians under the Protection of the Government? By no Means. The Fact is to be condemn'd as unlawful; but though we would not vindicate their Conduct in every Re&s;pect, is it not the Duty of every good Man impartially to con&s;ider what have been the Circum&s;tances of tho&s;e People, and what they &s;uffered to provoke them to this de&s;perate and unlawful Act?</P>
<P>Would not this Cour&s;e di&s;cover more of that meek and chri&s;tian Spirit, which &s;ome People &s;o much profe&s;s and

&s;o little exerci&s;e? Nay, do not Candor, Piety, and Ju&s;|tice require that we &s;hould admit of every alleviating Cir|cum&s;tance in their Favour, rather than take &s;o much Pains (as many do) to aggravate their Crime, and make bad ap|pear wor&s;e?</P>
<P>THESE Incendiaries are not only enraged them&s;elves, at their dear Friends, the Indians, being &s;lain, but would have all the Re&s;t of the World of their Temper;&mdash;To ob|tain which End, they have wrote and publi&s;h'd &s;everal in|flamatory Pamphlets, a&s;&s;erting many fal&s;ehoods, with a De&s;ign to enrage the Populace again&s;t the&s;e poor di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, though ra&s;h People.&mdash;Go but into the Hou&s;e of a Quaker, and before you have Time to di&s;cover what you came for, he will a&s;k you, with an affected Meekne&s;s, "Ha&s;t thee &s;een the Ma&s;&s;acre of the Indians at Lanca&s;ter?"&mdash;A Pam|phlet well known to be wrote by one of their zealous Friends, in Order to &s;well the Current of Prejudices again&s;t the afore&s;aid People.</P>
<P>I &s;hou'd be glad to &s;ee the Ma&s;&s;acre of the Back Inha|bitants drawn by the &s;ame able Hand, provided he would do it with the &s;ame Zeal in their Favour, and again&s;t the Savage Indian Butchers, as I'm confident he could have a much more affecting Subject to handle, and fill every Imagination with Horror.&mdash;None of tho&s;e killed at Lanca&s;ter were by De&s;ign kept one Moment in Torment; whereas many of our Frontier Inhabitants have been wan|tonly kept whole Days and Nights in exqui&s;ite Tortures, prolong'd and heighten'd with all the Contrivances infernal Malice could &s;ugge&s;t before tho&s;e Savages (who&s;e Cau&s;e and Intere&s;t Quakers &s;o warmly e&s;pou&s;e) would vouch&s;afe to give the merciful fini&s;hing Blow!</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="009646_0005_0F773A34841359A8">TERRIBLE! indeed beyond De&s;cription, are the Cruel|ties daily practi&s;ed by tho&s;e Savages on our Fellow Sub|jects, while Pri&s;oners among&s;t them! But where are the Quakers who have taken up Arms to defend them? Where are the Quakers who have &s;ympathized with them, or pi|tied their Di&s;tre&s;&s;es? Let their Chri&s;tian Conduct &s;ince the Commencement of the War declare.&mdash;</P>
<P>WHEN the Indian Incur&s;ions la&s;t Summer laid wa&s;te a con&s;iderable Part of our Frontier, by which near a thou|&s;and Families were drove from their Places, reduced to the utmo&s;t Poverty, and thrown upon the Public-Charity for the Support of their mi&s;erable Lives.&mdash; How did the&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> merciful, compa&s;&s;ionate Quakers (who would &s;eem to monopolize Chri&s;tian Charity, and all the Tenderne&s;s of human Nature among&s;t them&s;elves) behave on &s;o melan|choly an Occa&s;ion?&mdash;To their immortal Infamy be it known, that when every other religious Society in the Ci|ty, even the Roman Catholicks, whom they &s;o much de|&s;pi&s;e, (tho' &s;addled at the Time with the heavy Expence of building a Chapel) were &s;en&s;ibly affected with the Di&s;|tre&s;&s;es of the poor unhappy Sufferers, and promoted very generous and liberal Contributions for their Relief and Sup|port, The&s;e compa&s;&s;ionate and merciful Chri&s;tians, &s;o ea|&s;ily affected with Pity for Indians, would not grant a &s;in|gle Farthing (as a Society) for the Relief of their Fellow Subjects. Tho' Ju&s;tice requires we &s;hould exempt from this Odium a few worthy Individuals in the City, who contributed on the Occa&s;ion; as al&s;o a few others in the Town and Neighbourhood of Lanca&s;ter, who rai&s;ed about Thirty Pounds for the &s;ame Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>WHEREAS when their Good Brethren the Indians (&s;ome of whom were well known by Officers now in the City, to
<PB N="6" REF="009646_0006_0F773A354D2E4480">
have been in the Battle again&s;t Col. BOQUET; and others at the Siege of Fort Pitt, during the Summer) &s;eem'd to be in Danger of receiving their ju&s;t De&s;erts from the Hands of a bereft and injured People, no Toils or Fa|tigues by Night or Day are thought too great, nor no Ex|pence too much to protect the&s;e Bo&s;om Friends. Nay, their very fundamental Principles of Non-Re&s;i&s;tance, which would never before bend in Defence of King or Country, are chearfully &s;acrificed on the intere&s;ting. Occa|&s;ion, as a Compliment to perfidious Savages.</P>
<P>THE PAXTON PEOPLE'S coming down armed, in a &s;eem|ingly ho&s;tile Manner, is al&s;o ju&s;tly to be condemned, &mdash;But whil&s;t we condemn particular Facts, let us not mi&s;repre&s;ent the general Characters of the&s;e People.</P>
<P>LET it be con&s;idered, that they had, long before, &s;ent &s;everal Petitions to the Governor and A&s;&s;embly, which, its &s;uppos'd, have been conceal'd by &s;ome ill de&s;igning per&s;ons: And tho' his Honour never receiv'd the&s;e Re|mon&s;trances, yet the di&s;tre&s;s'd People believ'd he had, and look'd upon them&s;elves as utterly neglected and their &s;uf|ferings de&s;pis'd by the Government.</P>
<P>Now let any candid Per&s;on con&s;ider this Circum|&s;tance, added to their numberle&s;s other Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and he will certainly admit &s;uch an Apology for their Extrava|gancies as the wi&s;e SOLOMON &s;ugge&s;ts, that "Oppre&s;&s;i|on will make a wi&s;e Man mad."&mdash;And have not all Nations and Generations found it &s;o, that when People have been driven to De&s;peration by Oppre&s;&s;ion, they have broken thro' all Ob&s;tacles to right them&s;elves, if at all in their Power:&mdash;Nay, is not the happy and glorious REVOLUTION, by which our civil and religious Rights, as
<PB N="7" REF="009646_0007_0F773A35951FE9C8">
ENGLISHMEN and PROTESTANTS, were &s;ecured on their pre&s;ent Footing, a &s;triking In&s;tance of this known truth?</P>
<P>WHAT the&s;e People intended by their coming down arm'd let them&s;elves declare. I only ob&s;erve, that the Manner of their Behaviour when they came, did them Honour; as it &s;hew'd them to be brave, loyal and di&s;creet.</P>
<P>THEY &s;ent in a Memorial to the Governor, which was deliver'd by a Member of the A&s;&s;embly (tho' it has &s;ince been fal&s;ely a&s;&s;erted, that they never had a Notion of Remo&s;trating, till they &s;aw how Things &s;tood when they came to Germantown) &s;etting forth their Grievances, and begging Redre&s;s; at the &s;ame Time giving A&s;&s;urance that they did not intend to do the lea&s;t Injury to any of their fellow Subjects. And that they were &s;incere in this Declaration their Conduct has &s;ufficiently prov'd. They let his Honour know that by &s;uch a Time they wou'd be at Germantown, and there halt till he was pleas'd to give them an An&s;wer.&mdash;It was then propos'd, by Gentlemen of Candour and Humanity, to &s;end out Delegates to treat with tho&s;e People: But this was warmly oppos'd by &s;ome of the People call'd Quakers, who &s;poke to this Effect.
<Q>That they had Force &s;ufficient to kill the whole, and tho' &s;ome of the Citizens &s;hou'd lo&s;e their Lives, it was better &s;o than conde&s;cend to treat with &s;uch a Banditti.</Q></P>
<P>NEVERTHELESS the Gentlemen's Opinion, who were more aver&s;e to &s;hedding the Blood of their fellow Subjects than the meek, peaceful, in&s;pir'd Quakers, did prevail; and the Day following &s;ome Gentlemen of unexceptiona|ble Character, went to Germantown, and had a Meeting with Delegates from the Paxton Voluntiers. But in&s;tead of finding them a &s;en&s;ele&s;s rude and lawle&s;s Banditti, they found them a well behav'd and orderly People who avowed
<PB N="8" REF="009646_0008_0F773A3649B32B68">
(and I believe very &s;incerely) the greate&s;t Loyalty to his Maje&s;ty, and Love to their Country. They were willing to di&s;per&s;e and return to their re&s;pective Homes, provided their Grievances might have a fair Hearing, which was ac|cordingly agreed to. Per&s;ons were appointed by them to attend for that purpo&s;e, and they accordingly di&s;pers'd without doing any the lea&s;t Mi&s;chief. They have indeed charg'd the People call'd Quakers with gro&s;s partiality to Indians, and their being unfit for Government: Nay they a&s;cribe the greate&s;t part of their &s;ufferings to them alone. And that Quakers have been partial, and &s;hown more real Affection for Enemy Savages than for their fellow Sub|jects, of certain Denominations, is &s;o well known in this Province, and has on the pre&s;ent Occa&s;ion been &s;o fully demon&s;trated to the World, that I &s;hould deem it Lo&s;s of Time to &s;ay any more on &s;o recent and glaring a Fact: Whether the Affection which &s;ome Principals of that Sect have &s;hewn to Indians, and the great Care they are now taking of them can po&s;&s;ibly be owing to the Charms of their Squaws, to any particular Advantages that may a|ri&s;e from their Trade, or perhaps rather from the U&s;e they have made of them to a&s;per&s;e the Proprietaries and oppo&s;e their Intere&s;ts, may be con&s;idered as a vain Que&s;tion, which I will not undertake to determine. But this is certain, that there is not the lea&s;t Probability that any of the&s;e In|dians will ever &s;tand as Candidates for Seats in the A&s;&s;em|bly, and it is probable &s;ome of the Paxton Voluntiers may, if &s;uch as bid faire&s;t &s;hou'd not be murdered by &s;ome of the Savages now in our Cu&s;tody. Therefore it might &s;eem Policy, agreeable to &s;ome Quakers, not to afford them that Protection, nor &s;hew them that Regard they at this Time &s;hew the Savages.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="009646_0009_0F773A3768E82330">LET us impartially next con&s;ider Quakers with Re&s;pect to Government:&mdash;Can it be con&s;i&s;tent that a Per&s;on who declares that his Con&s;cience by divine In&s;piration forbids him to have any Hand in &s;hedding Blood, &s;hould be intru&s;|ted as a Repre&s;entative for People who look on them&s;elves to be obliged by the Laws of God, the Laws of Nature and the Laws of their King and Country to take up Arms to defend them&s;elves, and puni&s;h tho&s;e who would deprive them of Life or Property? Nay, is it not an inexpre&s;&s;ible Ab&s;urdity that a warlike People &s;hould be governed by Per&s;ons of Quaker Principles, and e&s;pecially in Time of War.&mdash;Yet that great Numbers of &s;uch have long been Members of our A&s;&s;embly is too true, and that they have often &s;pent their Time in debating, whil&s;t our poor Fron|tier Inhabitants, have been Suffering is al&s;o Truth. And tho' they have at la&s;t voted Men and Money for warlike U&s;es, it was not until they found they could no longer keep their Places of Honour and Tru&s;t without doing &s;o. But at the &s;ame Time they have done every Thing in their Power to prevent any of their own Sect taking up Arms in Defence of their Country; and if at any Time any of their young Men took up Arms again&s;t our common Ene|my, they were &s;ure to be excommunicated, which they call reading out of Meeting.&mdash; And is it not certain, that when their King and Country call them to Arms, they plead Con&s;cience, and will tell thee, with a pious Air, and meek Countenance, "they would rather peri&s;h by the Sword than u&s;e it again&s;t the Enemies of the State.&mdash; But if any of their Fellow Subjects become obnoxious to their mild and peaceful Rage, by oppo&s;ing any of their arbitrary Mea&s;ures, we then &s;ee the Quaker unma&s;k'd, with his Gun upon his Shoulder, and other warlike Habiliments,
<PB N="10" REF="009646_0010_0F773A37CBEFC170">
eagerly de&s;iring the Combat, and thir&s;ting for the Blood of tho&s;e his Opponents.</P>
<P>AND here let me ob&s;erve, that the very People whom the Quakers took up Arms to de&s;troy, were tho&s;e who protected their Lives and Properties, whil&s;t the&s;e ungrate|ful People &s;at unmole&s;ted in their Hou&s;es, and were pre|&s;erved from feeling the Severities and Contrivances of In|dian Cruelty.</P>
<P>'TIS owing to the brave Stand which the&s;e unrequited Voluntiers have made again&s;t the Inroads of Savages, that the Quakers are now able to treat their Protectors with &s;uch Ingratitude.&mdash; No Excommunications now for taking up Arms!&mdash; Behold the Meeting-Hou&s;e converted into a Place of Arms!&mdash;No Preaching nor Praying heard there, but the beating of Drums, and confu&s;ed cla&s;hing of Arms, by Men who knew not how to u&s;e them. Whil&s;t &s;ome of their Preachers are bu&s;ied in procuring Powder and Shot, others are employed in refre&s;hing the Spirit of their brave Soldiers with Wine and other Liquors.&mdash; And are the&s;e the People who are taught by immediate In&s;piration that it is a heinous Crime to fight? What amazing Hypocri&s;y ap|pears in their Profe&s;&s;ion! They mu&s;t either confe&s;s that they have hitherto re&s;i&s;ted the Holy Spirit, or impiou&s;ly a&s;&s;ert that the Spirit has changed his Mind, and now di|rects them to War and Blood, contradictory to his for|mer In&s;pirations.&mdash; But this is to bla&s;pheme God and be|lie the Holy Gho&s;t, yet &s;uch is their Conduct!</P>
<P>BUT one of the&s;e pious Quakers might here &s;ay,
<Q>Thee art mi&s;taken Friend;&mdash; It is true, we profe&s;s to have an Aver&s;ion to War: But this, with mo&s;t of us, is from Policy rather than Principle. Nay we &s;ecretly rejoice when we hear of whole Settlements murdered and de|&s;troyed.
<PB N="11" REF="009646_0011_0F773A3891CFB140">
And don't thee con&s;ider that the De&s;truc|tion of the Back Inhabitants le&s;&s;ens a growing Party again&s;t us; whil&s;t we are pro&s;pering and thriving on the Fat of the Land: And tho' our Malice at pre&s;ent is openly pointed only at the Presbyterians; yet to be plain with thee, we are as much in our Hearts again all who differ from us in Opinion: And can thee blame us for &s;eeking the Overthrow of all that oppo&s;e the good Schemes of the faithful? But thee knows it would be impolitic to di&s;cover our Re&s;entment to too many Sects at once, for by &s;o doing we might endanger our|&s;elves and our Affairs.</Q>
I think there can be only one Objection to &s;uch a Declaration from a Man call'd a Qua|ker, and that is, it would be acting with more Openne&s;s and Hone&s;ty than is generally found among&s;t them.</P>
<P>BUT it may be a&s;k'd, Why all this Clamour again&s;t Qua|kers! Surely they don't &s;olely govern. True, Thank God they do not: But if a few artful bad Men in the Ad|mini&s;tration may be very detrimental, what may we ap|prehend where &s;o many Quakers are intru&s;ted, who have lately prov'd their very Religion to be a political Engine, to which they them&s;elves pay no con&s;cientious Regard, but as it &s;uits their crafty Purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>IT was the Ob&s;ervation of Con&s;tantius, Father to Con|&s;tantine the great, that, "they who were fal&s;e to their "God, would never be true to their Prince." Upon which he di&s;carded the Pagans whom he had prov'd to be ready to embrace any Religion indifferently, and employ|ed the Chri&s;tians, who firmly adhered to their Profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>LET us look round and &s;ee who are tho&s;e who enjoy the Places of Profit and Tru&s;t in this Province; (a very few excepted) are they not Quakers or Quaker's Creatures

and was it not from Policy more than Ju&s;tice, I doubt not they would long e'er now have monopoliz'd the whole to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>IT has been argued, if the Indians are guilty, let their Accu&s;ers appear, and not put them to Death without a fair Trial.&mdash; Indeed it is a hard Matter to prove an Indian guilty, unle&s;s he was taken in the Fact; for to Day they are painted red, To-morrow blue, and the next Day any other Colour that they think will be&s;t prevent their being known; But tho' hard, it is not impo&s;&s;ible with Re&s;pect to &s;ome.&mdash; It is certified that a Dutch Woman, now in the Jer&s;eys, and her little Daughter, &s;eeing the Gang of Indians now in our Barracks, pa&s;&s;ing thro' that Province, knew the very Per&s;ons with whom they were Pri&s;oners.&mdash; But it has been proved, by a very circum&s;tantial Oath of a young Man, (who has &s;ince very unaccountably di&s;ap|peared) that the Quakers, or Per&s;ons who appeared to be &s;uch, have conveyed off and concealed tho&s;e that were mo&s;t &s;u&s;pected.&mdash;If this be true, are not they the People who de&s;pi&s;e the Laws of their Country, and fly in the Face of Government, by &s;topping the Cour&s;e of public Ju&s;tice? Believe me my Countrymen, tho&s;e who will &s;helter and conceal a Murderer, would perpetrate a Mur|der, and &s;uborn or &s;uppre&s;s an Evidence.</P>
<P>FROM what has been &s;aid, I hope my Countrymen will coolly con&s;ider whether Quakers are fit to be their Repre|&s;entatives or not, after &s;uch glaring and po&s;itive Proofs of their In&s;incerity; and whether we ought to continue to en|tru&s;t them with our Lives and Liberties: But I do not &s;peak of them all, nor condemn the Lump; I do not doubt but there are good Men among&s;t them, Men who would not hold the lea&s;t Part in Government for all the

It is true, every man has Liberty to profe&s;s his Belief, nor &s;hould any be forced to act contrary to it; I only contend for People's adhereing &s;trictly to what they Profe&s;s, and that tho&s;e who do not &s;hould be looked upon as Deceivers of Men, and therefore not fit to be entru&s;ted.</P>

<P>SINCE I wrote the foregoing, I have had the Plea&s;ure of &s;ee|ing in print the DECLARATION and REMONSTRANCE of the Frontier-Counties. From thence it is evident, That the People have long &s;uffered great Hard&s;hips, and with as much Patience as any of their Neighbours would have done, the Quakers by no Means excepted; who have, on every Occa&s;ion, manife&s;ted much greater Impatience, and le&s;s Fortitude of Spirit, if only their political Schemes have been vigorou&s;ly oppos'd.</P>
<P>IT will appear that the Frontier Inhabitants have been both loyal and peaceable Members of Society, and do not now plead for Favours, but Ju&s;tice; nor &s;trive for Pre-emi|nence, but their e&s;&s;ential Rights, and a moderate Equality.</P>
<P>AND I pre&s;ume it will be obvious, that whoever endeavours to oppre&s;s and deprive them of their Rights, act partially, and maliciou&s;ly, and aim to drive them to Extremities, then ac|cu&s;e them of what they, in a Manner, forced them to do, and, it would &s;eem, de&s;ired they might do.&mdash;Let but real Grievances, &s;uch as none can pretend to deny, be removed; and let plain Ju&s;tice be done, and the People will be quiet and peaceable Members of the Community as hereto|fore.</P>
<P>IN a Word, let but all ju&s;t Cau&s;es of complaint be taken a|way, and then let them be puni&s;h'd if they make a Noi&s;e

<P>TO talk again&s;t Pre&s;byterians as &s;uch, on this Occa&s;ion, is the Effect either of Malice and Party Spirit, or Non&s;en&s;e; for tho' they happened to be generally Pre&s;byterians who were &s;o abu&s;ed and injured, yet Principles of BRITISH LIBERTY and the Sen&s;e or Sentiments of Nature alone, not of Pre&s;byterini&s;m, or any other Denomination, breath in their Remon&s;trance and Petition.&mdash;Let any cool Jud|ges, before they pa&s;s Sentence, imagine them&s;elves to be in the very &s;ame Circum&s;tances, and then think how they would feel? and let &s;uch as ob&s;erve how a ju&s;t Re&s;entment is apt to tran&s;port their own Minds, and cau&s;e them, on le&s;s Occa&s;ions, to go beyond proper Rules&mdash;at lea&s;t excu&s;e, tho' not approve &s;ome unguarded Actions of an injured People.</P>
