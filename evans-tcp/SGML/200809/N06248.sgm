<P><HI>BRETHREN,</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1756" UNIT="year"> I HAVE received an Account from Sir <HI>William John&s;on,</HI> &s;ent me by Sir <HI>Charles Hardy,</HI> Governor of <HI>New-York,</HI> that, immediately after the Council held at <HI>Fort John&s;on,</HI> De|puties were di&s;patched by the <HI>Six Nations</HI> to <HI>At&s;aningo,</HI> and that they convened the <HI>Delawares, Shawane&s;e,</HI> and other <HI>Indians,</HI> from the &s;everal Towns on the <HI>Sa&s;quehannah,</HI> to the Number of Three Hundred, to whom they delivered Me&s;&s;ages from that Council, blaming them for taking up the Hatchet again&s;t their Brethren the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and command|ing them to lay it down immediately; and that they had hearkened to this Me&s;&s;age, and agreed to &s;trike no more.&mdash;What I tell you is in this Letter. [<HI>Here the Governor gave Mr.</HI> Wel&s;er <HI>Sir</HI> Charles Hardy's <HI>Letter of the 16th of</HI> April, <HI>to interpret to them. And when he had made them under&s;tand what Sir</HI> Charles Hardy <HI>had wrote, the Governor took a Belt in his Hand, and proceeded.</HI>]</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I think it nece&s;&s;ary that the <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Wioming,</HI> as well Enemies as Friends, &s;hould know, that Sir <HI>Charles Hardy</HI> has &s;ent this Account to me from Sir <HI>William John&s;on</HI>; and as two of you are of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> and one a <HI>Delaware,</HI> I think it proper that you &s;hould undertake to notify this to them; and at the &s;ame Time to let them know, as from your&s;elves, that if they are &s;incerely di&s;po&s;ed to Peace, and will deliver up the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pri&s;oners to the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> and hearken to their Advice in laying down the Hatchet, and abide by &s;uch Terms as &s;hall be agreed on, you can venture to a&s;&s;ure them, that tho' much Blood has been &s;pilt, and that the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> in Re&s;entment of this, are well prepared to avenge them&s;elves, yet they have &s;o great Regard for the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> that it will be in their Power to per&s;wade the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> not to pro&s;ecute the War, but to accept fair, ju&s;t and honourable Terms; and I provide you with this Belt, to deliver it to them with &s;uch a Speech.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I &s;peak my own &s;incere Inclinations, when I &s;ay I am for Peace; and not only my own, but the Sentiments of others, and particularly the earne&s;t De&s;ire of a Number of People, who are the De&s;cendants of tho&s;e that came over with the fir&s;t Proprietor; all tho&s;e are ex|tremely de&s;irous to interpo&s;e with the Government, to receive the Submi&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Dela|wares,</HI> and to overlook what is pa&s;t, and e&s;tabli&s;h for the future a firm and la&s;ting Agree|ment, Peace and Affection between us, and have repeatedly applied to me for this Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>As many Stories have been told to the <HI>Indians</HI> to our Prejudice, I de&s;ire you will unde|ceive them; and particularly I do charge <HI>William Locquies</HI> to acquaint the <HI>Delawares,</HI> that tho&s;e of their Tribe who live among us, have not had any Mi&s;chief done them, but are treated with our u&s;ual Kindne&s;s, and are at Liberty, and live in Peace and Plenty among us.&mdash;I charge you <HI>William Locquies,</HI> to declare the Truth to the <HI>Indians,</HI> and to a&s;&s;ure <PB N="4" REF="007923_0003_102E0222438AD470">them that they have been impo&s;ed on; and relate the Care that has been taken, as well by the Government of <HI>New-Jer&s;ey,</HI> as this, of all the <HI>Indians</HI> who have &s;taid with us, and that they enjoy our Protection, and live as happily as ever.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P><HI>Paxino&s;a,</HI> and &s;ome other <HI>Shawane&s;e,</HI> and other <HI>Indians,</HI> have not broke Faith with us, but endeavoured to di&s;&s;uade the <HI>Delawares</HI> from &s;triking us.&mdash;When they could not &s;ucceed, they &s;eparated from them, and now live together in &s;ome Place near <HI>Wioming</HI>; I would have you go to them, and let them likewi&s;e know this Account from Sir <HI>William Joh&s;on,</HI> and a&s;&s;ure them from me, that if they are inclined to come within the Inhabitants, you have my Orders to conduct them; or if they do not incline to come now, but at any other Time, they will, on &s;ending me a Me&s;&s;age, be provided with a &s;afe Conduct, and meet with an hearty Welcome.&mdash;Let them know that <HI>Scarroyady</HI> related to me what had pa&s;ied between him and them; and that <HI>Aroas</HI> and <HI>David</HI> have likewi&s;e made me acquainted with what was &s;aid by them when they were la&s;t at <HI>Wioming.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Then the Governor gave them a String to give to</HI> Paxino&s;a.</P>
<P>Newca&s;tle, Jagrea, <HI>and</HI> William Locquies, <HI>returned the Governor an An&s;wer,</HI> viz.</P>
<P>That the Me&s;&s;ages were very good, and what they approved mightily, and would under|take the Journey, and deliver them faithfully; but then they mu&s;t de&s;ire the Governor would make their Apology to Colonel <HI>Clapham,</HI> and tell him, that nothing but the Governor's Commands would have induced them to delay their coming to him.</P>
<P>The Governor promi&s;ed he would; and then told them, that Mr. <HI>Spangenberg</HI> was de&s;ired to be pre&s;ent, having &s;ome <HI>Delaware Indians</HI> under his Care, that he might hear what was delivered to them.&mdash;He de&s;ired they would go by Way of <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> and take with them one or more of the <HI>Indians</HI> there, and that Mr. <HI>Spangenberg</HI> would prepare tho&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> for their Vi&s;it, and per&s;wade &s;ome of them to accompany them to <HI>Wioming.</HI></P>
<P>The Me&s;&s;engers returned, and on the 31&s;t of <HI>May,</HI> 1756, made the following Report, <HI>viz. That on their Arrival at</HI> Wioming, <HI>they found the</HI> Indians <HI>had left the Town, and gone up the River; they therefore proceeded to</HI> Teaogon, <HI>where they met with a great Number of</HI> In|dians, <HI>and informed them they had brought a Me&s;&s;age from the Governor of</HI> Penn&s;ylvania, <HI>and de&s;ired a Meeting of all their People in that Town and near it; which being obtained in two Days, they then delivered their Me&s;&s;age.&mdash;After which,</HI> Paxino&s;a, <HI>as Speaker of their Council, returned the following An&s;wer,</HI> viz.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren, The Governor, and People of</HI> Penn&s;ylvania,</P>
<P>THE dark Clouds over&s;pread our Country &s;o &s;uddenly, that we have been all at once &s;e|parated, and that dark Cloud got in between us; and as it has plea&s;ed the mo&s;t High to di&s;pel it a little, &s;o that we can ju&s;t &s;ee one another again, our Eyes are now running with Tears, becau&s;e of the melancholy Sight of &s;eeing our Country covered with our own Blood (we mean yours and ours.) Give me Leave to wipe off the Tears from your Eyes, though at the &s;ame Time my own Eyes run with Tears in Abundance for what has pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>As you came a great Way, and through dangerous Places, where evil Spirits reign, who might have put &s;everal Things in your Way to ob&s;truct your Bu&s;ine&s;s, this String &s;erves to clear your Mind, and the Pa&s;&s;age from your Heart to your Mouth, that you may &s;peak freely to us.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a String.</HI></P>
<P>Teedyu&s;cung, <HI>a</HI> Delaware <HI>Chief, &s;poke next.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas, <HI>and the People of</HI> Penn&s;ylvania,</P>
<P>We rejoice to hear from you, and that you are willing to renew the old good Under|&s;tanding, and that you call to Mind the fir&s;t Treaties of Friend&s;hip made by <HI>Onas,</HI> our great Friend, decea&s;ed, with our Fore-Fathers, when him&s;elf and his People fir&s;t came over here. We take hold of the&s;e Treaties with both our Hands, and de&s;ire you will do the &s;ame, that a good Under&s;tanding and true Friend&s;hip may be re-e&s;tabli&s;hed. Let us both take hold of the&s;e Treaties with all our Strength, we be&s;eech you; we on our Side will certainly do it.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>What you &s;aid to us we took to Heart, and it entered into our Heart; and we &s;peak to you from our Heart; and we will deal hone&s;tly with you in every Re&s;pect.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a String.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="007923_0004_102E0223EDC3E970">
<HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>We de&s;ire you will look upon us with Eyes of Mercy. We are a very poor People; our Wives and Children are almo&s;t naked. We are void of Under&s;tanding, and de&s;titute of the Nece&s;&s;aries of Life. Pity us.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The</HI> Delawares, Mem&s;kies, <HI>and</HI> Mohickons, <HI>to</HI> Onas, <HI>and the People of</HI> Penn&s;ylvania.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>There is a great Number of our People among you, and in a Manner confined; we de|&s;ire you will &s;et them at Liberty, or rather give them a &s;afe Conduct to <HI>Wioming,</HI> where we intend to &s;ettle as on your Fire Side; there we will jointly with you kindle a Council-Fire, which &s;hall always burn, and we will be one People with you.</P>
<P><HI>Gave two Belts.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas, <HI>and all the People of</HI> Penn&s;ylvania,</P>
<P>We had the Misfortune that a great and dark Cloud over&s;pread our Country; but by our Prudence, and that of our Uncles, the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> it is now almo&s;t di&s;pelled, and we &s;ee the clear Heavens again. We the <HI>Delawares,</HI> the <HI>Shawane&s;e,</HI> the <HI>Mohickons,</HI> and <HI>Mem&s;kies,</HI> give you this String Wampum, and de&s;ire you, that the Bitterne&s;s which might have gather|ed in this dark and unhappy Time may be removed, and that you may by this Means &s;pit it out; take or accept this as a certain Cure for that Purpo&s;e, and pa&s;s by all that is pa&s;t, and think on your poor fooli&s;h Brethren with Mercy, and forget all the Evil done to you by them.</P>
<P><HI>Gave &s;everal Strings of Wampum.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>What our Uncles the <HI>Six Nations</HI> required of us, in your and their Behalf, by their Dele|gates, at <HI>Ot&s;aningo,</HI> we that live on the River <HI>Sa&s;quehannah</HI> have agreed to. We have laid a&s;ide our Hatchet, and will never make u&s;e of it any more again&s;t you or your Brethren, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>: All our young Men have been con&s;ulted about this, and all earne&s;tly agree to it, and we now &s;peak in their Pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t give you this Caution, not to charge them with any Thing that may be done by the <HI>Ohio Indians,</HI> who are under the Influence of the <HI>French</HI> again&s;t you. We a&s;&s;ure you, our young Men will do no more Mi&s;chief to your People.</P>

<P><HI>A String of four Rows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I am glad to find a good Spirit at la&s;t prevailing among&s;t you, and that you hearkened to my Me&s;&s;age, and laid it to Heart; you will ever find us, your Brethren, &s;incerely di&s;po&s;ed to con&s;ult and act for your true&s;t Intere&s;t, and in the &s;everal Matters which were or &s;hall now be particularly promi&s;ed on our Part, you may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured we mean punctually to per|from them, and expect the &s;ame Di&s;po&s;ition in you.</P>

<P>As you on your Parts have confirmed the Treaties and Leagues of Amity &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between you and this Government, and given a Belt in Confirmation thereof, and de&s;ire the &s;ame be done on our Part; I do now, by this Belt, ratify and confirm all former Treaties and En|gagements, and a&s;&s;ure, that they &s;hall be mo&s;t inviolably ob&s;erved as long as the Sun &s;hines.</P>
<P><HI>Here a large Belt was given.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>As Your Confirmation of former Treaties was accompanied with Profe&s;&s;ions of Sincerity, &s;o I make you the &s;tronge&s;t A&s;&s;urances of Truth in the Confirmation this Government has now made.</P>
<P><HI>A String of four Rows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>That you and I may have an Opportunity of making the&s;e mutual Declarations at a publick Convention, I now kindle a Council-Fire at the Hou&s;e of <HI>Conrad Wei&s;er,</HI> who is one of the Council of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> and the publick Interpreter of the Province.</P>
<P><HI>A large Belt of fourteen Rows.</HI></P>
<P>N. B. <HI>Mr.</HI> Weifer <HI>&s;aid it was nece&s;&s;ary to name a particular Place; but the</HI> Indians <HI>were, not with &s;tanding this, always at Liberty to name another; and he believed, from &s;omething Captain</HI> Newca&s;tle <HI>had dropped, the</HI> Indians <HI>would chu&s;e the</HI> Forks-of-Delaware.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>Having appointed a Place for us to meet in Council, I now clear the Roads to this Place, and remove the Logs and other Ob&s;tructions out of it, &s;o that it may be perfectly &s;afe for every one de&s;irous to u&s;e it to travel to their Brethren when met in Council.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt of eight Rows, and eight Strings tied to it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>It is offen&s;ive to &s;ee Blood &s;pilt upon the Road u&s;ed by People who have lived in Friend|&s;hip together, I therefore remove all Blood out of the Road that leads to the Council-Fire.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt of nine Rows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>Your <HI>Indians</HI> who live among us go where they plea&s;e; they live as we do; and enjoy their Liberty. We only hinder them from going to the Frontiers, where they might be mi&s;taken for Enemies, and hurt or killed; and that the <HI>Indians</HI> may know the Truth of this, we &s;end &s;ome of them along with our Me&s;&s;engers to <HI>Teaogon,</HI> who will declare what Treat|ment they have had from us. What few we have in Confinement &s;hall be &s;et at Liberty when the Council meets, and be brought there.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>This la&s;t is a very important Article, and what we ab&s;olutely depend upon, That all Pri|&s;oners taken on both Sides &s;hall be delivered up, as there can be no Sincerity on either Side where this is not done, and that in the mo&s;t faithful and ample Manner, without keeping back a &s;ingle Pri&s;oner; this Belt a&s;&s;ures you that it &s;hall be punctually performed by us, and we expect the &s;ame punctually on your Side.</P>
<P><HI>Two Belts, the one of &s;even, the other of eight Rows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>You have mentioned to us the Di&s;tre&s;&s;es you have been, and are, in, for Want of Nece&s;&s;a|ries; the&s;e are owing to your having given Way to the Influences of an evil Spirit, and &s;truc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> us your Brethren without any Cau&s;e; and as you have brought it on your&s;elves, you have the le&s;s Rea&s;on to complain: But now that a good Spirit begins to &s;hew it&s;elf in you, and you de&s;ire to meet us in Council, I &s;hall bring with me a Sufficiency of Clothes and Provi|&s;ions to relieve tho&s;e Di&s;tre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>As you have laid down the Hatchet, and de&s;ire the &s;ame may be done by us, our Me&s;|&s;enger carries with him our Proclamation for Su&s;pen&s;ion of Ho&s;tilities within the Limits there in &s;pecified, of which we have informed the <HI>Six Nations.</HI></P>

<P>Agreeable to the repeated Advice and Reque&s;t of <HI>Scarroyady,</HI> and other <HI>Indians</HI> of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> then re&s;iding in this Province, I engaged to build a Fort at <HI>Shamokin,</HI> for the Protec|tion of our Friendly <HI>Indians,</HI> their Wives and Children; and I now acquaint you with the March of the Forces, in order to effect this u&s;eful Work, that it may give no Umbrage the Commander having my Orders not to act offen&s;ively.</P>

I a&s;&s;ured you of an hearty Welcome as &s;oon as I came here, and of my Protection; and I now, in the Name of this Government, again bid you welcome. As Captain <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> brought me no An&s;wer to &s;ome Part of the Me&s;&s;ages I &s;ent la&s;t by him, I expect to receive them by you. I hope you come prepared to &s;peak to us freely, &s;incerely, and openly, and de&s;ire you may do &s;o.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P>To which <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> immediately an&s;wered.</P>
<P>La&s;t Spring you &s;ent me a String; and as &s;oon as I heard the good Words you &s;ent, I was glad; and as you told us, we believe it came from your Hearts, &s;o we felt it in our Hearts, and received what you &s;aid with Joy.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t Me&s;&s;ages you &s;ent me, came in the Spring; they touched my Heart; they gave me Abundance of Joy. I returned an An&s;wer to them, and waited for your &s;econd Me&s;&s;ages, which came after &s;ome Time, and were likewi&s;e very agreeable. By the la&s;t you acquainted me that you had kindled a Council Fire, and invited me and my People to it. We accepted the Invitation; and I came accordingly, and have &s;taid &s;everal Days, &s;moaking my Pipe with Patience, expecting to meet you here. We are ready to hear what you have to &s;ay, and not only we, but five other Nations, in all ten Nations, are now turning their Eyes this Way, and wait what will be &s;aid and done at this Meeting.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="007923_0007_102E02295C47A790"><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I &s;olemnly, and with the utmo&s;t Sincerity, declare, that tho' you may think I am a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> here, yet it will not be long before you will be convinced that I am here by the Appoint|ment of ten Nations, among which are my Uncles the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> authorizing me to treat with you, and what I do they will all confirm. The Truth of this you will &s;oon have made evident to you.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>Hearken to what I am going to &s;ay: I declare, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn Manner, that what I now relate is the Truth. Abundance of Confu&s;ion, Di&s;order and Di&s;traction has ari&s;en among the <HI>Indians,</HI> from People taking upon them to be Kings, and Per&s;ons of Authority. In every Tribe of <HI>Indians</HI> there have been &s;uch Pretenders, who have held Treaties, &s;ome|times publick, and &s;ometimes in the Bu&s;hes; &s;ometimes what the&s;e People did came to be known, but frequently it remained in Darkne&s;s, or at lea&s;t no more was imparted to the Publick than they were plea&s;ed to publi&s;h. To &s;ome they held up their Belts, but others never &s;aw them; this bred among the <HI>Indians</HI> great Heart-burnings and Quarrels, and I can a&s;&s;ure you, that the pre&s;ent Clouds do, in a great Mea&s;ure, owe their Ri&s;e to this wild and irregular Way of doing Bu&s;ine&s;s.&mdash;The <HI>Indians,</HI> &s;en&s;ible of this Mi&s;take of our An|ce&s;tors, are now determined to put an End to this Multitude of Kings, and to this dark Way of proceeding; they have agreed to put the Management of their Affairs into the Hands of a very few, and the&s;e &s;hall no longer have it in their Power to huddle up and give partial Repre&s;entations of what is done. I a&s;&s;ure you, that there are only two Kings appointed to tran&s;act publick Bu&s;ine&s;s, of which I am one. For the future, Matters will go better on both Sides; you as well as we will know who we are to deal with. We mu&s;t be&s;eech the mo&s;t High to &s;catter the Clouds which have ari&s;en between us, that we may &s;ettle Peace as heretofore.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren, the</HI> Engli&s;h, <HI>and particularly the Governor of</HI> Penn&s;ylvania,</P>
<P>You know you have invited me here; I came therefore; my Uncles, the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> will confirm what I &s;ay. In your Me&s;&s;ages to the <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Dialago</HI> you &s;ignified to us, that you heard we were in Want and Di&s;tre&s;s, which to be &s;ure we are, and pitied us and our poor Wives and Children. We took it kindly, and as a Word that came from your Heart. Now is the Time for you to look about, and act the Part of a charitable and wi&s;e Man.&mdash; Be there|fore &s;trong&mdash;be a&s;&s;ured that, though I am poor, I will do my Share. Whatever Kindne&s;s you do to me, or my People, &s;hall be public&s;hed to ten <HI>Indian</HI> Nations. We will not hide any Pre&s;ents you &s;hall give us; every Body &s;hall know that we have heard your good Words. We will not do as others, and &s;ome of our Uncles, the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> have done, &s;neak away, and hide your Words and Pre&s;ents in the Bu&s;hes, but &s;hall publi&s;h far and near, that all may join with us. Exert your&s;elves now in the be&s;t Maner you can, and you will obtain your End.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>The Conclu&s;ion of my Words is no more than this; the Matter in Hand is of too great Moment for one Man. I am but a Me&s;&s;enger from the <HI>United Nations,</HI> though I act as a Chief Man for the <HI>Delawares.</HI> I mu&s;t now hear what you have to &s;ay to my People at this Council-Fire. If it be good, I &s;hall lay hold of it, and carry it to the <HI>United Nations,</HI> who will &s;mile and be plea&s;ed to hear good News. If what you will &s;ay be di&s;agreeable, I will, notwith&s;tanding, keep it clo&s;e (<HI>here be clo&s;ed his Fi&s;t</HI>) and deliver it faithfully to the <HI>United Nations,</HI> and let them, as they are my Superiors, do as they &s;ee Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Being a&s;ked if he had done, he &s;aid he had for the pre&s;ent; the main Thing, he added is yet in my Brea&s;t, laying his Hand to his Heart, but this will depend on what Words the Governor will &s;peak to us. Then he repeated the <HI>Delaware</HI> Word, <HI>Whi&s;h-&s;hick&s;y,</HI> the &s;ame in <HI>Mohock</HI> Language as <HI>Jago,</HI> with great Earne&s;tne&s;s, and in a very pathetick Tone. Mr. <HI>Wei&s;er</HI> who knew the Word to have a very exten&s;ive and forcible Sen&s;e, de&s;ired the Interpreter t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a&s;k him what he meant by <HI>Whi&s;h-&s;hick&s;y</HI> on this particular Occa&s;ion, and explained him&s;elf i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the following Manner.

<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I AM going to &s;peak to you on the Affair we are met about; my Speech will contain Mat|ters of great Moment: By this String of Wampum therefore I open your Ears, that you may give a proper Attention.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>The Inhabitants of this Province have ever been a peaceable People, and remarkable for their Love and con&s;tant Friend&s;hip to the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> and other <HI>Indians</HI> in Alliance with them.</P>
<P>When our Back Inhabitants were attacked la&s;t Fall, we at fir&s;t were at a Lo&s;s to know from whence the Blow came; and were much &s;urprized when we were informed that it was given by our old Friends and Neighbours the Cou&s;ins of our Brethren the <HI>Six Nations</HI>; we won|dered at it; and the more &s;o, as we had not, to our Knowledge, given them any ju&s;t Cau&s;e of Offence.&mdash;As &s;oon as we knew this, we &s;ent to the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> and informed them of it, and de&s;ired to know, whether this Blow had been &s;truck by their Direction, or with their Pri|vity or Con&s;ent: And on receiving A&s;&s;urances from them, that it was not done with their Con|&s;ent, and that they greatly di&s;approved &s;uch Conduct, we made ready to revenge the Injury we had received, and we wanted neither Men or Arms, Ammunition, nor Strength to do it, and to take Vengeance for the Injury done us; yet, when we had the Hatchet in our Hands, and were prepared not only to defend our&s;elves, but to carry the War into the Country of tho&s;e who had &s;truck us, we &s;ent again to the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> agreeable to the Treaties &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between us, to acquaint them of our Intentions. They let us know they had held a Grand Council, at <HI>Fort John&s;on,</HI> on this Matter, and that Deputies from thence were &s;ent to &s;ummon a Meeting of <HI>Delawares</HI> and <HI>Shawane&s;e</HI> at <HI>Ot&s;aningo,</HI> who were return|ed with an Account, That their Nephews had, at their Interpo&s;ition, laid down the Hatchet, and would &s;trike the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> no more. The <HI>Six Nations</HI> having received the&s;e A&s;&s;urances from the <HI>Delawares</HI> and <HI>Shawane&s;e,</HI> reque&s;ted us not to execute our ho&s;tile Purpo&s;es, but to &s;u&s;pend Ho&s;tilities; declaring, that they would fully accommodate this Breach, and bring about a Peace. At this Reque&s;t of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> we kept our Warriors at Home, for guarding and protecting our Frontiers. I then &s;ent <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> and other <HI>Indian</HI> Me&s;&s;engers to you, to notify the Advices of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> with re&s;pect to what had been determined at <HI>Ot&s;aningo,</HI> in&s;tructing him, in ca&s;e he found you &s;incerely di&s;po&s;ed for Peace, and inclined to return to your Alliance with us, to a&s;&s;ure you, on the Behalf of this Government, that we were willing to it, on ju&s;t and honourable Terms. <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> and the other Me&s;&s;engers, re|turned with your An&s;wers; in which you acknowledged, you had been under the Influence of an Evil Spirit, but were well di&s;po&s;ed to return to your old Amity and Friend&s;hip; at the &s;ame Time letting us know, that you was &s;orry for what had pa&s;&s;ed; that you was in Di&s;tre&s;s, and de&s;ired we would pity your Di&s;tre&s;&s;es. To &s;hew our Readine&s;s to enter into a Treaty, and our Sincerity in what was &s;aid by <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> I &s;ent him back again to you, to let you know, on the Behalf of this Government, that I had kindled a Council-Fire, invited all your People to it, cleared the Road, wa&s;hed off the Blood, and promi&s;ed, if your People would come to Council, and renew former Leagues, and do what is further nece&s;&s;ary on the Occa&s;ion, I would bring &s;omething with me to relieve your Di&s;tre&s;&s;es.&mdash;I thought it right to go through this Account in this particular Manner, that you might know from my&s;elf what was the Subject of the Me&s;&s;ages &s;ent by <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> and what was the Sub&s;tance of the An|&s;wers I received by him. And now, I &s;uppo&s;e (as I do not &s;ee the Body of your <HI>Indians</HI> here) your People, in general, did not believe <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> but &s;ent you to know if he had my <PB N="10" REF="007923_0009_102FC1B4A6143EC8">Authority for the &s;everal Matters he delivered to you, and to hear them from my own Mouth. I do not blame you for this Caution, it be&s;peaks your Care. The Matters he was charged with being of the la&s;t Concern, for the Satisfaction of all your People, how wide &s;o|ever they are di&s;per&s;ed, I do in this publick A&s;&s;embly, in the Name of the Government, and People of this Province, a&s;&s;ure you, that Captain <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> acted by my Authority; and in Confirmation of what I have &s;aid, and that what he delivered, was by Authority from me, I give you this Belt.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>Being now convinced out of my Mouth, of the Sincerity of my Profe&s;&s;ions made to you by Captain <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> and of the Di&s;po&s;itions of the People of this Province, to renew the antient Friend&s;hip that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between <HI>William Penn</HI> and the <HI>Indians.</HI> I de&s;ire you will re|port this to the <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Diahogo,</HI> and to the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> and to all the <HI>Indians</HI> far and near, as my Words, &s;poken to them in the Name, and on the Behalf of the Government of <HI>Penn|&s;ylvania.</HI> I invite them all to this Council-Fire; the greater the Number that &s;hall come, the more acceptable it will be to me. I invite, and de&s;ire you will bring with you, your whole People; but then you mu&s;t bring here with you al&s;o all the Pri&s;oners you have taken during the&s;e Di&s;turbances; I mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t on this, as an Evidence of your Sincerity to make a la&s;ting Peace, for, without it, though Peace may be made from the Teeth outwards, yet while you retain our Fle&s;h and Blood in Slavery, it cannot be expected we can be Friends with you, or that a Peace can come from our Hearts. I repeat this Article of the Pri&s;oners as a nece&s;&s;ary Condition of Peace, and de&s;ire you will con&s;ider it as &s;uch: If in this you deal with us &s;incerely, we &s;hall e&s;teem you &s;incere in every Thing el&s;e, and proceed to re|new our former Leagues and Covenants, and become again one Fle&s;h as before. And I mu&s;t remind you (as we are acting in Con&s;ort with the <HI>Six Nations</HI>) to bring &s;ome of your Uncles along with you, that they may &s;ee all that pa&s;&s;es, and be Witne&s;&s;es of the good Effects of their and our Me&s;&s;ages to you.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>In Te&s;timony of the Satisfaction you have given all our People by your coming to this Council-Fire, they have put into my Hands a &s;mall Pre&s;ent for you and your young Men, which will be given you at any Time you &s;hall think proper. I have likewi&s;e given Orders to the Captains of the Forts, on the Frontiers, to furni&s;h you with as much Provi&s;ions as you can carry, for the U&s;e of the People you have left behind you.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>Only a few of you are now come down; this Pre&s;ent of Goods therefore is but &s;mall; when the Body of your Nation comes here, which I expect they will, and the Pri&s;oners are delivered up, and a firm Peace made, larger Pre&s;ents will be given, and your Di&s;tre&s;&s;es re|lieved in a more ample Manner.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>Great Works require &s;trong Hands and many; this is a good and a great one, the Work of Peace; it requires &s;trong Heads, and found Hearts; we de&s;ire many &s;uch may be joined together: I therefore de&s;ire your A&s;&s;i&s;tance for <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> in this Matter; having great Influence with many who live far di&s;tant from us, you are e&s;teemed, and will be heard; we therefore chu&s;e you as Agent and Coun&s;ellor for this Province; engage in it heartily. You ought to do it; you owe it to the Country in which you was born; you owe it to your Brethren the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>; you owe it to your Uncles the <HI>Six Nations</HI>; you owe it to your own People over which you pre&s;ide: We de&s;ire you will heartily undertake it, and u&s;e your ut|mo&s;t Endeavours to bring about this great and good Work we have now begun.</P>
<P><HI>A large Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> an&s;wered, that he had received the Governor's Words kindly, and would, in a few Words, an&s;wer him. Then taking a large Belt in his Hand, he proceeded.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>At the very Time <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> came with your la&s;t Me&s;&s;ages, I was in Treaty with the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> and then received this Authority from them. [<HI>Li&s;ting up the Belt.</HI>] This Belt de|notes, that the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> by their Chiefs, have lately renewed their Covenant Chain with us; formerly we were accounted Women, and employed only in Womens Bu&s;ine&s;s; but now they have made Men of us, and as &s;uch we are now come to this Treaty. Having this Authority as a Man to make Peace, I have it in my Hand, but have not opened it; but will &s;oon declare it to the other Nations. This Belt holds together ten Nations; we are in the Middle, between the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>; look at it. There are but two Chiefs of the ten Nations; they are now looking on, and their Attention is &s;ixed, to &s;ee who are di&s;po&s;ed <PB N="11" REF="007923_0010_102E02310F94DC70">really for Peace.&mdash;This Belt further denotes, that whoever will not comply with the Terms of Peace, the ten Nations will join again&s;t him and &s;trike him; &s;ee the dangerous Circum|cum&s;tances I am in; &s;trong Men on both Sides; Hatchets on both Sides; whoever does in|cline to Peace, him will I join.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>This is a good Day; whoever will make Peace, let him lay hold of this Belt, and the Nations around &s;hall &s;ee and know it. I de&s;ire to conduct my&s;elf according to your Words, which I will perform to the utmo&s;t of my Power. I wi&s;h the &s;ame good Spirit that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the good old Man <HI>William Penn,</HI> who was a Friend to the <HI>Indians,</HI> may in&s;pire the People of this Province at this Time.</P>
<P><HI>Then delivered the Belt.</HI></P>
<P>The Governor received it, and &s;aid, I take hold of the Belt, and am plea&s;ed with what has been &s;aid; it is all very good.</P>
<P><HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> then explained the Belt, &s;aying, it was &s;ent him by the <HI>Six Nation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"></HI> accepted of it: You &s;ee, &s;ays he, a Square in the Middle, meaning the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> <HI>dians,</HI> and at one End the Figure of a Man, indicating the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>; and at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> another, meaning the <HI>French</HI>; our Uncles told us, that both the&s;e coveted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> let us join together to de&s;end our Lands again&s;t both, you &s;hall be Partakers with us of our Lands.</P>
<P><HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> and his Son came and dined with the Governor; and after Dinner, &s;ome more of the <HI>Indians</HI> coming in, the Governor acquainted <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> that he had &s;omething of Importance to communicate to him. The Governor then informed him, That as he was going to Council this Morning, he received a Letter from the Northern Frontiers, with very bad News, that gave him a great deal of Concern: By this Letter he received Advice, that &s;ome <HI>Indians</HI> had killed four of our White People at the <HI>Mini&s;inks</HI>; this occa&s;ioned our Forces to be upon their Guard, and a Party of them fell in with three <HI>Indians,</HI> and judging them to be Enemy <HI>Indiens,</HI> one of them was killed in endeavouring to make his E&s;cape; and then the Governor entered into the Particulars related in <HI>Van Etten</HI>'s Letter. The Go|vernor &s;aid, he did not know what <HI>Indians</HI> had done this Mi&s;chief. If the <HI>Indian</HI> who was killed was our Friend, he was &s;orry for it; but if our Enemy, he was glad of it.</P>
<P><HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> &s;aid, that when he came here to Council, all the <HI>Indians</HI> there abouts knew of it; and therefore he believed it mu&s;t be the <HI>French Indians</HI> that killed our People; but that if his People were &s;o fooli&s;h as to come on our Borders at this Time, and were killed any how, they mu&s;t take the Reward of their Folly. None of the&s;e private Deaths ought to affect a publick Mea&s;ure; nor would this make any Alterations in his Councils.</P>

<P>You are &s;o good, and received us &s;o kindly, I will al&s;o give you &s;ome of that good To|bacco that the <HI>Six Nations</HI> have put into my Pipe; you &s;hall &s;moak of it your&s;elves; you will find it is good, and I will give of the &s;ame Tobacco wherever I go (meaning the Me&s;&s;age from the <HI>Six Nations</HI> to them, to be at Peace with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>) The &s;ame Thing that I have offered to you I will offer to all the <HI>Indians,</HI> and at the &s;ame time tell them, that you have &s;moaked of this Tobacco; but to do this requires me to be rich, and yet I am poor.&mdash; It will take up a long Time, as there are many Nations to &s;end the Pipe to; but in two Months I hope to go my Rounds, and be here again with a large Number, of different Na|tions; I &s;ay it may be in two Months, but it may be longer, as the People live at a great Di&s;tance from one another. I a&s;&s;ure you I will execute every Thing you have de&s;ired of me, and let the <HI>Six Nations</HI> know all that has pa&s;&s;ed between us; and that I am your Agent and Coun&s;ellor in the <HI>Delaware</HI> Nation.</P>

<P>MR. <HI>WEISER</HI> was a&s;k'd, Whether it was intended the Governor &s;hould keep the Belt <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> gave, or return it? Mr. <HI>Wei&s;er</HI> an&s;wered, That having &s;ome Doubts about it, he put the &s;ame Que&s;tion to <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> who &s;aid the Belt was &s;ent by the <HI>Six Na|tions</HI> <PB N="13" REF="007923_0012_102E023444631BA0">to the <HI>Delawares,</HI> and as it was given by them to the Governor, it ought to be pre&s;erved among the Council Wampum, being a Belt of great Con&s;equence; and it would be well to return another of a Fathom long, and at the Delivery of it, which mu&s;t be in Council To|morrow, to make a proper Addre&s;s to <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> that he would be diligent, and carry it to all the Nations within his Influence. <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> &s;aid further, That <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> would want Abundance of Wampum, and if he had it not, the Cau&s;e would &s;uffer exceedingly. He hoped the Council Bag was full, and de&s;ired it might be emptied into the Lap of <HI>Teedyu&s;cung.</HI> Mr. <HI>Wei&s;er</HI> concurring in Opinion, and &s;aying, that the <HI>French</HI> gave great Quantities of Wampum to their <HI>Indians,</HI> and on Matters of Con&s;equence their Belts were &s;everal Fathom long, and very wide, the Secretary was ordered to bring what Wampum he had into Coun|cil, <HI>viz.</HI> Fifteen Strings, and &s;even Belts, a Parcel of new black Wampum, amounting to &s;even Thou&s;and; and having no new white Wampum, nor any proper Belts to give in Re|turn for <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI>'s Peace Belt, a Me&s;&s;enger was &s;ent to <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> and he returned with five Thou&s;and; upon which the <HI>Indian</HI> Women were employed to make a Belt of a Fathom long, and &s;ixteen Beads wide; in the Center of which was to be the Figure of a Man, mean|ing the Governor of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> and on each Side five other Figures, meaning the ten Na|tions mentioned by <HI>Teedyu&s;cung.</HI></P>
<P>The King, who was very irregular in his Vi&s;its, as well as in his Di&s;cour&s;es, bolted all of a &s;udden into the Room, and with a high Tone of Voice &s;poke as follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>Brother,</P>
<P>I de&s;ire all that I have &s;aid, and you have &s;aid to one another, may be taken down aright; &s;ome &s;peak in the Dark; do not let us do &s;o; let all be clear and known. What is the Rea|&s;on the Governor holds Councils &s;o clo&s;e in his Hands, and by Candle Light? The <HI>Five Na|tions</HI> u&s;ed to make him &s;it out of Doors like a Woman.&mdash;If the <HI>Five Nations</HI> &s;till make him a Woman, they mu&s;t; but what is the Rea&s;on the Governor makes him a Woman, meaning, Why does he confer with <HI>Indians</HI> without &s;ending for him, to be pre&s;ent and hear what was &s;aid?</P>
<P>The Governor an&s;wered, That he holds Councils on a Hill; has no Secrets; never &s;its in Swamps, but &s;peaks his Mind openly to the World; what happens here he has a Right to hear: The Women were &s;ent for to make a Belt, not to Council. The <HI>Six Nations</HI> may be wrong, they are not under his Direction; and therefore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> is not an&s;werable for their Con|duct, if they have not treated the <HI>Delawares</HI> as Men.</P>
<P>The Chief thanked the Governor, &s;eemed well plea&s;ed, and &s;aid, To-morrow he would &s;peak more, and what he had to &s;ay was from the <HI>Six Nations:</HI>&mdash;He that won't make Peace mu&s;t die.</P>

<P>It was agreed in the Morning the Governor &s;hould deliver the new Belt, then in making, to <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> with a proper Speech; that by two Belts tied together, <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> and <HI>Teedyu&s;|cung</HI> &s;hould be made joint Agents for this Government, and they be de&s;ired to con&s;ult to|gether, to love one another, and to act for the be&s;t; that the new black Wampum, and all the Belts and Strings, &s;hould be given to <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> and a private Pre&s;ent made to him and his Interpreter, <HI>Ben.</HI></P>

<P>Then the Governor &s;poke as follows:</P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Newca&s;tle, <HI>and</HI> Teedyu&s;cung,</P>
<P>I &s;et an high Value upon this Belt; it is the Peace Belt which <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> delivered in Coun|cil; I very chearfully lay hold of it; I will lay it up with the Council Belts, and declare to you, I am mo&s;t heartily di&s;po&s;ed to effect the Meaning of this Belt, a &s;peedy and honourable Peace, and a Return of the Offices of Love and Friend&s;hip between the <HI>Indians</HI> and thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Brethren the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI>&mdash;In Return, I give you the Belt now making, which you will con&s;ide<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> as fini&s;hed; and when done, &s;hew it every where, and make our Di&s;po&s;itions and the Treat|ment you have met with known to your own People, the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> and all your Allies.&mdash; [<HI>Here the Governor gave the new Belt, &s;o far as it was made, and all the Wampum prepared for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> it, de&s;iring, if it was not enough to complete it, that they would add more.</HI>] Then taking up th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> two Belts, joined together, in his Hands, and addre&s;&s;ing <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> and <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> delared them Agents for the Province, and gave them Authority to do the publick Bu&s;ine&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> together.

<P>To which they an&s;wered, That they would be mutual good Friends, and lay their Head<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> together, and do every Thing in their Power to promote the weighty Matters entru&s;ted to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> them.</P>
<P><HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> added, If his Memory &s;hould not &s;erve him in every Thing committed to hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Charge, or Things &s;hould be crooked, he would return to us, and make them &s;traight. What he &s;ays comes from his Heart, and not from his Lips; his Heart and ours &s;hould be one, and be true to one another; for if different Liquors are put in a Calk, and thaked, they will mix<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and come out one.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="007923_0014_102E02381B4AA608">The Governor &s;aid, that he had written down what <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> &s;aid on the Belt deli|vered by him, and will keep it in his Heart. It is very agreeable to him and the People of <HI>Penn|&s;ylvania.</HI> He will lay up the Belt in the Council-chamber as a Mark of his Friend&s;hip. As he is appointed Agent for <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> with Captain <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> he puts into his Hands all the Belts and Wampum he has here, to be made u&s;e of by him in the Cour&s;e of his Nego|tiations, as he may judge mo&s;t proper, and mo&s;t for the Intere&s;t of the People of this Pro|vince.</P>
<P><HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> an&s;wered, That he might meet with Difficulties in tran&s;acting the important Bu&s;ine&s;s committed to his Charge; but as he is now one of the Council of the Province of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> he a&s;&s;ures his Brethren, that he will exert him&s;elf faithfully, and to the utmo&s;t of his Abilities, in the Service; and if he meets with crooked Paths, he will endeavour to make them &s;traight.</P>
<P>The Governor thanked <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> and <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> for their undertaking to be Agents for <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> on this Occa&s;ion, de&s;ired that they might unite and co-operate one with ano|ther, and con&s;ult together on the proper Mea&s;ures to be entered into by them, and delivered them two Belts tied together, as a Sign or Symbol of that Harmony and Unanimity that ought to &s;ub&s;i&s;t between them.</P>
<P><HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> &s;aid, That he was plea&s;ed with being joined with <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> in the publick Bu&s;i|ne&s;s; that he hoped Matters would be brought to a happy I&s;&s;ue; that he wi&s;hed there might be a firm Friend&s;hip and la&s;ting Union between the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> the other <HI>Five Nations,</HI> and the People of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> and that they might be as one Man. He further &s;aid, that he had a large Family, and having a great Way to go, he had no Means of carrying any more Provi&s;ions than would &s;erve him on the Road; he therefore de&s;ired that he might be furni&s;h|ed with a Hor&s;e, that he might be enabled to carry Nece&s;&s;aries for his Family.&mdash;Whereupon the Governor promi&s;ed to let him have a Hor&s;e, and he promi&s;ed to return him again the next Time he came down.</P>
<P>The Governor then taking into his Hands all the Belts, Strings, and Bundles of new black Wampum, gave them to <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> and de&s;ired he would u&s;e them to the be&s;t Advantage among the Nations he &s;hould apply to.</P>

<P>May it plea&s;e your Excellency to hear a few Words; I will put the Governor and Gen|tlemen in mind, that Conferences were held here in the Summer, and what pa&s;&s;ed there is well known.</P>
<P>I have taken all the Pains po&s;&s;ible to execute what I then undertook, and have brought with me &s;everal of different Tribes, as well <HI>Delawares</HI> as <HI>Six Nation Indians.</HI></P>

<P>Some bad Reports have lately been &s;pread, which de&s;erve to be no more minded than the Whi&s;tling of Birds; the&s;e I would remove by this Belt, and take away all bad Impre&s;&s;ions that may have been made by them.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt of eight Rows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I have done for the pre&s;ent, and another Time, if God &s;pares Life, I will begin the main Matter I came to do.</P>
<P><HI>The Governor replied.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I return you Thanks for your kind Speech, and likewi&s;e for the Regard you &s;hewed me in &s;ending two of the <HI>Six Nation Indians</HI> along with Mr. <HI>Wei&s;er</HI> to meet me. I unfortunately took a different Road, and &s;o we mi&s;&s;ed of one another; but it gave me great Satisfaction to hear by Mr. <HI>Wei&s;er,</HI> that he and tho&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> were de&s;irous to meet me, and conduct me to Town.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>Many idle Reports are &s;pread by fooli&s;h and bu&s;y People; I agree with you, that on both Sides they ought to be no more regarded than the Chirping of Birds in the Woods.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>By this Belt I open your Eyes and Ears, and particularly the Pa&s;&s;age from your Heart to your Mouth, that in what you have to &s;ay to this Government they may both concur, nor the Mouth utter any Thing but what is fir&s;t conceived in the Heart: And I promi&s;e you Openne&s;s and Sincerity in every Thing I &s;hall &s;peak.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P>The Governor &s;aid, he would be ready to hear what <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> had further to &s;ay at Eleven o'Clock To-morrow Morning.</P>

<P>The Governor ordered the Interpreter to acquaint <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> that he was ready to bear him, and be delivered him&s;elf as follows.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>THIS is to notify to you, that at the Treaty held here in the Summer, I promi&s;ed to publi&s;h what was then delivered to me to all the Nations I could have any Influence on; and that I have performed all I promi&s;ed, and done my Duty faithfully, with Re&s;pect to all the&s;e <PB N="18" REF="007923_0017_102E023F93CB8910">Nations, I can evidence by &s;ome of them who are come with me, and are now here, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> your Plea&s;ure, ready to hear what you have to &s;ay to us, and di&s;po&s;ed to do every Thing in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> their Power, in Confirmation of what has been, or will be, tran&s;acted.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>This Belt &s;ignifies that I took Notice of, and paid a due Regard to, every Thing &s;ent by the Me&s;&s;engers you &s;ent to me at <HI>Diahogo,</HI> whom I received kindly. You may in particular<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> remember, that you took hold of my Hand, and thereupon I came to this Place, where the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Council-Fire was appointed to be kindled: When I came here, I found every Thing &s;aid by your Me&s;&s;engers true; which, on my Return, I made known, as well as every Thing el&s;e that was then delivered to me, to ten different Nations, <HI>Delawares</HI> and <HI>Six Nations</HI>; and as many of them as I have prevailed upon to come with me, can evidence the Truth of this.</P>
<P>We are all put in mind of the ancient Leagues and Covenants made by our Fore-Fathers, and of the former Union and mutual kind Actions of our and their Ance&s;tors; what was pro|po&s;ed here renewed the Remembrance of the&s;e former happy Times.</P>
<P>Though we are but Children in Compari&s;on of them, and of little Ability, as you well know, yet we have picked up a few Chips, and will add them to the Fire, and hope it will grow a great Fire, and blaze high, and be &s;een by all the different <HI>Indian Nations,</HI> Spectators of what we are now doing.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt of ten Rows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I remember what has pa&s;&s;ed in Di&s;cour&s;e and Conver&s;ation among our old antient Peo|ple, e&s;pecially about Governor <HI>Penn</HI>; what he &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d to the <HI>Indians</HI> is fre&s;h in our Minds and Memory, and I believe it is in yours. The <HI>Indians</HI> and Governor <HI>Penn</HI> agreed well to|gether; this we all remember, and it was not a &s;mall Matter that would then have &s;eparated us: And now, as you fill the &s;ame Station he did in this Province, it is in your Power to act the &s;ame Part.</P>
<P>I am now before you ju&s;t what you &s;ee me; I repre&s;ent my&s;elf only to be a Boy; I am really no more. Now as Misfortunes have happened by the bad Spirit, by our Enemy, and by &s;ome of our fooli&s;h young People, I declare unto you the Truth, that I have ever been &s;orry to &s;ee it thus, and, as far as I know my&s;elf, if it co&s;ts me my Life, I would make it otherwi&s;e.&mdash;As I have already proceeded a great Way, and prevailed on tho&s;e who have &s;tept out of the Way, and on many of whom I had little or no Expectation, to enter into peaceable Mea&s;ures, I now call upon you to u&s;e your Ability, which is much greater than ours, to a&s;&s;i&s;t this good Work, to encourage it, and to confirm it to good Advantage.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt of &s;even Rows.</HI></P>
<P>Taking the Belt up again, he added, What you have &s;aid I have truly imparted to all, and what you &s;hall now &s;ay I &s;hall likewi&s;e hold up; I &s;hall not put it into my Bo&s;om, but de|clare it, and di&s;tribute it to all, that it may have a good Effect.</P>

<P>I AM going to give you an An&s;wer to what was &s;aid by you at our la&s;t Meeting, and would have done it &s;ooner, if I had not expected to have &s;een more of our <HI>Indian</HI> Bre|thren here; I &s;hall u&s;e the utmo&s;t Sincerity on my Part, and de&s;ire you will hearken at|tentively.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I ob&s;erve what you have &s;aid, in regard to your faithful Performance of all the Matters given you in Charge by this Government when you were la&s;t here, and do heartily thank you for the diligent Care you have taken to make known to all the <HI>Indian</HI> Nations our good Di&s;|po&s;itions for Peace, and for inviting them to come to this Council-Fire, and for the further A&s;&s;urances you make in Behalf of tho&s;e pre&s;ent, and of many more who are ab&s;ent, even &s;ome of whom you had little Expectations of, that all will be done in their and your Dower to bring the &s;ame to a happy I&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>You have done well to con&s;ider the antient Leagues &s;ub&s;i&s;iting between you and this Go|vernment from its very fir&s;t Beginning. I am plea&s;ed to hear you expre&s;s your&s;elf &s;o affec|tionately in Favour of the fir&s;t Proprietor; he very well de&s;erves it at the Hands of all the <HI>Indians</HI>; he was always ju&s;t and kind to them, and he gave it in Charge to his Governors, and to his Children the pre&s;ent Proprietaries, to treat them, as he did, with the utmo&s;t Affection, and to do them all Manner of good Offices, which has always been done by them, as far as is come to my Knowledge.</P>
<P>As to my&s;elf, after the pre&s;ent Proprietaries had appointed me to this Government, they re|commended the Care of the <HI>Indians</HI> to me in a very particular Manner; and I a&s;&s;ure you, I &s;hall be ready on all Occa&s;ions to do the <HI>Indians</HI> every Service in my Power, and mo&s;t hear|tily a&s;&s;i&s;t in bringing about a la&s;ting and durable Peace.&mdash;I throw a large Log into the Coun|cil-Fire, that it may blaze up to the Heavens, and &s;pread the Ble&s;&s;ings of Peace far and wide; this Belt confirms my Words.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Teedyu&s;cung,</P>
<P>What I am now going to &s;ay to you &s;hould have been mentioned &s;ome Time ago: I now de&s;ire your &s;trict Attention to it.</P>
<P>You was plea&s;ed to tell me the other Day, that the League of Friend&s;hip made by your Fore-fathers was as yet fre&s;h in your Memory; you &s;aid that it was made &s;o &s;trong that a &s;mall Thing would not ea&s;ily break it. As we are now met together, at a Council-Fire, kindled by us both, and have promi&s;ed on both Sides to be free and open to one another, I mu&s;t a&s;k you, how that League of Friend&s;hip came to be broken? Have we, the Governor or People of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> done you any Kind of Injury? If you think we have, you &s;hould <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, and tell us your Hearts: You &s;hould have made Complaints before you &s;truck us, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;o it was agreed, in our antient League: However, now the great Spirit has thus happily brought us once more together, &s;peak your Mind plainly on this Head, and tell us if you have any ju&s;t Cau&s;e of Complaint, what it is; that I may obtain a full An&s;wer to this Point, I give this Belt.</P>

<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I REMEMBER Ye&s;terday by the&s;e Strings that you would have had a Conference &s;ooner, had you not expected that the <HI>Indians</HI> who were invited would have come to this Coun|cil.&mdash;I thank you for the kind Things you have &s;poke, and for reminding me of what pa&s;|&s;ed in former Times; I will endeavour to tell you the Truth from the Bottom of my Heart, and hope you will have Patience to hear me; all I &s;hall deliver &s;hall be according to the Authority I have received, as tho&s;e who are now with me will witne&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Gave three Strings of black and white Wampum.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>The Times are not now as they were in the Days of our Grandfathers; then it was Peace, but now War and Di&s;tre&s;s; I am &s;orry for what has happened, and I now take and wipe the Tears from your Eyes, as there is great Rea&s;on for Mourning. This I not only do on my own Part, but on the Part of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> who will put their Seal to it.&mdash;I take away the Blood from your Bodies, with which they are &s;prinkled: I clear the Ground, and the Leaves, that you may fit down with Quietne&s;s: I clear your Eyes, that when you &s;ee the Day-light you may enjoy it.&mdash;I declare this not only for the <HI>Indians</HI> I repre&s;ent, but for the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> who, with them, make up Ten in all, which have with us put their Hands to the&s;e Words.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt of nine Rows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>Now I have done wiping your Eyes and Bodies, and cleaning the Ground where you fit; I will al&s;o heal your Wounds, not only at the Top, but at the Bottom; I will apply to them the good Plai&s;ter which the Great Creator has made for the&s;e Purpo&s;es. I &s;ay I will heal the Wound, &s;o as it may never break out more, but be compleatly cured; in this the <HI>Six Nations</HI> al&s;o join with me.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt of eight of Rows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>Now as I have healed the Wound, our Ca&s;e is like that of two Brothers; when one has been &s;ick, and has recovered his Health, it is u&s;ual for the other to be glad; ju&s;t &s;o it is with me now: Your Wound is cured;&mdash;I am glad to &s;ee you Face to Face, as it has plea&s;ed the good Spirit to bring us together.

<P><HI>Gave a Belt of eleven Rows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I am now going to tell you &s;omething in a few Words, in An&s;wer to your Reque&s;t la&s;t Night, that I &s;hould give you a true Account how I came to &s;trike you.</P>
<P>In the Beginning of the Confu&s;ion and War that happened the Fall before this, I lived in the Middle of the Road leading from the <HI>Six Nations</HI> to <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> where I was ordered, by my Uncles to &s;it down; and there I &s;at in profound Peace, under no Apprehen&s;ion of Danger; and when I looked towards <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> I &s;aw my Brother the Governor, and no|thing but Peace and Friend&s;hip; and when I looked the other Way towards my Uncles the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> every thing was al&s;o Peace there; &s;o it was with me until all at once a Man, who&s;e Name is called <HI>Charles Broadhead,</HI> an Inhabitant of this Province, came to me at <HI>Wioming,</HI> and told me, as if he had &s;uch a Me&s;&s;age from the Governor, that I had &s;truck my Brethren the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> which I denied over and over; and when I could not prevail with <PB N="22" REF="007923_0021_102E0249153179E0" MS="y">him to believe me, I took two Handfuls of Wampum, and de&s;ired him to go down with them to the Governor, and a&s;&s;ure him that it was not I who &s;truck the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> I al&s;o de|&s;ired the Governor to let me know what further Mea&s;ures I &s;hould take, to &s;atisfy him and my Brethren the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> of the Truth of this.&mdash;I al&s;o de&s;ired, by the &s;ame Me&s;&s;enger, that the Governor would take all the prudent Methods he could to relate this to Colonel <HI>John&s;on</HI> and to my Uncles the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> as I was under a good deal of Concern that this Charge was laid again&s;t me.&mdash;There were two Kings pre&s;ent be&s;ides me, who joined with me in the Me&s;&s;age; and I likewi&s;e de&s;ired the Governor to &s;end me Word what to do, for which I waited till I was out of Patience, and obliged to flee, and leave my Inheritance on that Account.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>According to your other Que&s;tion or Reque&s;t la&s;t Night, to know of me why I &s;truck you without fir&s;t giving you a Rea&s;on for it; I will tell you the Truth why I have unfortunately &s;truck you. I &s;ay, Brother, I will tell you the very Truth, in An&s;wer to your Que&s;tion. I never knew any of our ancient Kings ever to have this in their Minds, I now tell you that it came from a great King, at lea&s;t I think &s;o: The King of <HI>England,</HI> and of <HI>France,</HI> have &s;ettled or wrought this Land, &s;o as to coop us up as if in a Pen. Our fooli&s;h and ignorant young Men, when they &s;aw the Proceeding of this Enemy, and the Things that were told them, believed them, and were per&s;waded by this fal&s;e-hearted King to &s;trike our Brethren the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI>&mdash;According to your De&s;ire I will now tell you the Truth with an hone&s;t Heart, as far as is in my Power: After this unfortunate Management once prevailed, it is ea&s;y for all you <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> if you look into your Hearts, to find the Cau&s;e why this Blow came harden upon you than it would have otherwi&s;e done&mdash;but this is not the principal Cau&s;e; &s;ome Things, that have pa&s;&s;ed in former Times, both in this and other Governments were not well plea&s;ing to the <HI>Indians</HI>; indeed they thought them wrong; but as I &s;aid before, they were not the principal Cau&s;e. Being a&s;ked in what other Governments, he an&s;wered, in the Province of <HI>New-Jer&s;ey.</HI> Now, Brother, I have told you the Truth, as you de&s;ired me, and al&s;o the Unea&s;ine&s;s of my Mind, becau&s;e I verily believe it was our Duty to go to the very Bottom, be it as bad as it will, and that it is nece&s;&s;ary we &s;hould both open our whole Minds to one ano|ther, that we may agree to heal the Wound.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt of twelve Rows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>When I was here at the la&s;t Treaty, I did according to what I promi&s;ed. I took the Belt I received from this Government, and held it up to all the Nations I undertook to go to, and I took them all by the Hand (meaning, I invited them all to come to the Council-Fire.) One of the <HI>Delaware</HI> Nations, meaning the <HI>Mini&s;ink Indians,</HI> now about <HI>Fort Ailon,</HI> gave me this Belt, &s;aying, he was glad to hear what I &s;aid, and laid hold of the &s;ame Hand, meaning he accepted the Invitation; but &s;aid he would only go Part of the Way, no further than to a certain Place, and there he would &s;tay, but that I might proceed, for he would agree to whatever I did, being led by the &s;ame Hand, and giving me Authority to act for him, at this Council.</P>
<P>Then delivered the Belt, of ten Rows, given him by tho&s;e <HI>Indians,</HI> who be &s;aid were <HI>Mini&s;inks</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>By this String I al&s;o let you know, that I would not have you think I have fini&s;hed every Thing at this Meeting, though what I have now done is of great Moment; if we are &s;pared till another Day, that is, until next Spring, I will let you know &s;omething further in anoth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Meeting, for you mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible we cannot at one Time fini&s;h a Thing of &s;o great M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ment. In the mean time, I will u&s;e my faithful Endeavours to accompli&s;h every Thing to the Good of both of us.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a String.</HI></P>
<P>Then, pau&s;ing a while, he &s;aid he had forgot &s;omething, and taking up the String again, he proceeded.</P>
<P>I will let you know fully and freely my Mind, and what is my Determination to do.&mdash; When I return into my Country, I will look about me, I will &s;ee and hear for you.&mdash;If I hear of any Enemy, going towards you, I will &s;end a &s;uitable Me&s;&s;enger to give you Notice though it thould be at Midnight. I will al&s;o take every prudent Mea&s;ure to prevent any Dan|ger that may befal you; perhaps, if the Enemy be but few, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ay not come to know of it but if the Number be great, I &s;hall be the liklier to know it: However, be they more o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> le&s;s, I will let you know it.</P>
<P><HI>Then laid down the String again.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="007923_0022_102E024AAD353248" MS="y">Then the Governor de&s;ired of <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> as he had mentioned Grievances received by the <HI>Indians</HI> from this and other Governments, to let him know what they were, and to &s;peak his Mind freely and fully without any re&s;erve; upon which <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> &s;poke as follows.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>You have not &s;o much Knowledge of Things done in this Country as others who have lived longer in it, being but lately come among us.&mdash;I have not far to go for an In&s;tance: This very Ground that is under me (&s;triking it with his Foot) was my Land and Inheritance, and is taken from me by Fraud; when I &s;ay this Ground, I mean all the Land lying between <HI>Tohiccon Creek</HI> and <HI>Wioming,</HI> on the River <HI>Sa&s;quehannah.</HI> I have not only been &s;erved &s;o in this Government, but the &s;ame Thing has been done to me as to &s;everal Tracts in <HI>New-Jer|&s;ey,</HI> over the River. When I have &s;old Lands fairly, I look upon them to be really &s;old.&mdash; A Bargain is a Bargain.&mdash;Though I have &s;ometimes had nothing for the Lands I have &s;old but broken Pipes, or &s;uch Trifles, yet when I have &s;old them, though for &s;uch Trifles, I look upon the Bargain to be good: Yet I think I &s;hould not be ill u&s;ed on this Account by tho&s;e very People who have had &s;uch an Advantage in their Purcha&s;es, nor be called a Fool for it. <HI>Indians</HI> are not &s;uch Fools as to bear this in their Minds.&mdash;The Proprietaries, who have pur|cha&s;ed their Lands from us cheap, have &s;old them too dear to poor People, and the <HI>Indians</HI> have &s;uffered for it. It would have been more prudent in the Proprietaries, to have &s;old the Lands cheaper, and have given it in Charge to tho&s;e who bought from them, to u&s;e the <HI>In|dians</HI> with Kindne&s;s on that Account.</P>
<P>Now, Brother, hear me; &s;uppo&s;ing you had a Pipe in your Mouth, &s;moaking, of little Value; I come and take it from you; by and by, when you &s;ee me again, you remember it, and take a Revenge: I had forgot, and wonder at the Cau&s;e, and a&s;k you, Brother, Why you have done &s;o? This makes me remember the Injury I did you, and more careful for the future. Now, although you have purcha&s;ed our Lands from our Fore-fathers on &s;o rea&s;onable Terms, yet now at length you will not allow us to cut a little Wood to make a Fire; nay, hinder us from Hunting, the only Means left us of getting our Livelihood.</P>
<P>Now, Brother, I am plea&s;ed you a&s;ked me this Que&s;tion, having thereby given me an Op|portunity of &s;peaking my Mind freely as to any Unea&s;ine&s;s I was under.&mdash;You are wi&s;e enough to &s;ee the&s;e Things, and to provide a Remedy for them.</P>
<P>Then <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> produced a Receipt, from <HI>William Par&s;ons,</HI> for a Bundle of Deer-&s;kins he had &s;ent from <HI>Fort Allen</HI> as a Pre&s;ent to Governor <HI>Morris,</HI> and de&s;ired Mr. <HI>Peters</HI> to let him know if he had received them for the Governor; which he &s;aid he had.</P>
<P>He then a&s;ked Mr. <HI>Peters</HI> what was done with the Memorandum he gave to Governor <HI>Morris</HI> when he was in <HI>Philadelphia</HI> in <HI>April,</HI> 1755, containing a Claim to a &s;mall Pine Tract in <HI>New-Jer&s;ey</HI>; to which Mr. <HI>Peters</HI> &s;aid, that Governor <HI>Morris</HI> had promi&s;ed to enquire into the Matter, and the Memorandum would be returned to him at any Time, with Governor <HI>Morris</HI>'s Report on it.</P>
<P>The Governor then a&s;ked him, what he meant by Fraud; having &s;aid his Lands were taken from him by Fraud, what it meant?</P>
<P>To which <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> replied.&mdash;When one Man had formerly Liberty to purcha&s;e Lands, and he took the Deed from the <HI>Indians</HI> for it, and then dies; after his Death the Children forge a Deed like the true One, with the &s;ame <HI>Indian</HI> Names to it, and thereby take Lands from the <HI>Indians</HI> which they never &s;old&mdash;this is Fraud. Al&s;o, when one King has Land be|yond the River, and another King has Land on this Side, both bounded by Rivers, Moun|tains and Springs, which cannot be moved, and the Proprietaries, greedy to purcha&s;e Lands, buy of one King what belongs to the other&mdash;this likewi&s;e is Fraud.</P>
<P>The Governor then a&s;ked <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> Whether he had ever been u&s;ed in that Manner?</P>
<P>He an&s;wered, Yes;&mdash;I have been &s;erved &s;o in this Province: All the Land extending from <HI>Tohiccon,</HI> over the <HI>Great-Mountain,</HI> to <HI>Wioming,</HI> has been taken from me by Fraud; for when I had agreed to &s;ell the Land to the old Proprietary, by the Cour&s;e of the River, the young Proprietaries came and got it run by a &s;traight Cour&s;e by the Compa&s;s, and by that Means took in double the Quantity intended to be &s;old.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>As you have de&s;ired me to be very particular, I have told you the Truth, and have opened my Mind fully. I did not intend to &s;peak thus, but I have done it at this Time, at your Re|que&s;t; <PB N="24" REF="007923_0023_102E024CEA989A20" MS="y">not that I de&s;ire you &s;hould now purcha&s;e the&s;e Lands, but that you &s;hould look in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> your own Hearts, and con&s;ider what is right, and that do.</P>
<P>The Governor thanked him for the Freedom and Openne&s;s he had u&s;ed with him, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> told him, when he was ready to &s;peak to him, he would let him know it.</P>

And fur+ther, de&s;ired he might receive Orders from the Governor what to do, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">mi&s;ing to execut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> them faithfully; and if it &s;hould be judged nece&s;&s;ary, he would even go to Colonel <HI>John&s;on</HI> and the <HI>Six Nation</HI> Country, with any Me&s;&s;age the Governor would plea&s;e to &s;end there b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> him, but de&s;ired it might be &s;ent in a certain Number of Days, after which, if it did no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> come, he would take it for granted the Governor believed the Stories told of him.</P>
<P>The Governor enquired of Mr. <HI>Wei&s;er</HI> into the Foundation of the Complaint made by th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Indians,</HI> as to the Frauds &s;aid to be committed in Purcha&s;es of Land made of them by th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Proprietaries; and he told the Governor, That few or none of the <HI>Delawares</HI> pre&s;ent, as h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> could recollect, originally owned any of the&s;e Lands, or any Land in this Province; that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> any Injury was done, it was done to others, who were either dead or gone, &s;ome to the <HI>Ohi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> and &s;ome to other Places.&mdash;That as to the Lands particularly in&s;tanced by <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> heard that they were &s;old to, and the Con&s;ideration Money paid by, the fir&s;t Proprietary, <HI>Wil+liam Penn.</HI>&mdash;That when Mr. <HI>John Penn</HI> and Mr. <HI>Thomas Penn</HI> were here, a Meeting wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> then had with the principal <HI>Indians</HI> living on the&s;e Lands, and the former Agreement renew+ed, and the Limits again &s;ettled between the Proprietaries and tho&s;e Chiefs of the <HI>Delawares</HI> and accordingly a Line was &s;oon after run by <HI>Indians</HI> and Surveyors. That the <HI>Delaware<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> complaining afterwards, their Complaint was heard in a great Council of the <HI>Six Nations</HI> held at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> in the Year 1743, in which &s;everal Deeds, executed by the <HI>Delaware</HI> to the Proprietaries, were read, and interpreted, and the Signers Names and Marks examined and, after a long Hearing, the <HI>Six Nations</HI> declared the Complaints of their Cou&s;ins, the <HI>De|lawares,</HI> to be unrea&s;onable, and were very angry with them for complaining without Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Peters,</HI> being a&s;ked by the Governor, &s;aid, he had likewi&s;e heard Things to the &s;am<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Effect, and was pre&s;ent at the Council when the <HI>Delawares</HI> Complaints were heard and &s;et+tled by the <HI>Six Nations</HI>; that it was a very large Council, con&s;i&s;ting of the principal Chiefs o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the <HI>Delawares.</HI>&mdash;And added, he believed when the Matter &s;hould come to be well examine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> into, the Proprietaries would not be found to have done Inju&s;tice to the <HI>Delawares,</HI> or to hol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> any of their Lands, for which tho&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> had not given Deeds truly interpreted to them and received a Con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>But as neither Mr. <HI>Wei&s;er,</HI> nor he, was concerned in this Tran&s;action, and the Papers t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> prove it were at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> this Matter might, on the Governor's Return, be thorougly en+quired into, and if it &s;hould appear that Inju&s;tice had been done the <HI>Delawares</HI> in this, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> any other of their Sales, they ought to receive Satisfaction.&mdash;After which the Governor pro+po&s;ed to let the <HI>Indians</HI> know, that as to the particular Grievances they had mentioned, the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;hould be thorougly examined into, well con&s;idered, and, if ju&s;tly founded, amply redre&s;&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> as quickly as the Nature of the Bu&s;ine&s;s would admit.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="007923_0024_102E024FEC8527E0" MS="y">But upon conferring with the Commi&s;&s;ioners, he was told by them, that &s;uch Promi&s;es had been frequently made the <HI>Indians</HI> by Governors of other Provinces, and not performed, and the&s;e People might con&s;ider them as now made with a De&s;ign to evade giving them Redre&s;s.</P>
<P>The Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;aid further, as more Goods were brought than were proper at this Time to be given to the &s;mall Number of <HI>Indians</HI> come down, it would be better, whe|ther the Claim was ju&s;t or unju&s;t, to offer them immediate Satisfaction, which they, on the Part of the Publick, with the Governor's Approbation, were willing to do, judging this would effectually remove all their Unea&s;ine&s;s.

<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>YOU expre&s;&s;ed your Concern for what had happened, wiped the Tears from our Eyes, and the Blood from our Bodies, and having made clean the Council Seat, I heartily thank you for it.

<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I make you my Acknowledgments for your having &s;earched our Wounds to the Bottom, and the good Remedies you have applied for their Cure, and I pray the Great Creator may ble&s;s our mutual Endeavours, that they may be &s;o effectually healed as not to leave behind them the lea&s;t Scar, or ever break out again, whil&s;t the Rivers run, or the Sun and Moon give Light to the Earth.</P>

<P>As to what you &s;ay of the Me&s;&s;age delivered to you at <HI>Wioming,</HI> by <HI>Charles Broadhead,</HI> the Governor did &s;end him, and I could have wi&s;hed you had &s;ent &s;ome of your own People to me on &s;o weighty an Occa&s;ion; and for the future, I mu&s;t caution you not to hearken to any Me&s;&s;ages as from this Government, unle&s;s the Per&s;ons charged with them are known to be publick Officers, u&s;ually employed for &s;uch Purpo&s;es, and the Papers they produce are &s;ealed with the Seal of the Government.</P>

<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I thank you for the Openne&s;s with which you have expre&s;&s;ed your&s;elves as to the Cau&s;es why you &s;truck us.

<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>As I conceive this Belt to be your Authority for acting at this Council-Fire, in Behalf of the <HI>Mini&s;ink Indians,</HI> who only came Part of the Way, I will keep it, and put it into the Council Bag, being glad to hear they have put their Hand to the Belt I &s;ent, though I &s;hould have been better plea&s;ed to have &s;een them here.</P>

<P><HI>Gave a large String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I am very glad you have been as good as your Word in coming down to the Council-Fire which was kindled on this particular Occa&s;ion. I believe you have u&s;ed your be&s;t Endeavours, with great faithfulne&s;s, to effect every Thing you undertook. I heartily agree to the Peace as you have propo&s;ed it, provided all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colonies be included in it. But we cannot agree to make Peace for this Government alone, and leave you at Liberty to continue the War with our Brethren of the neighbouring Colonies; for we, the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> are all Subjects of one great King, and mu&s;t, for the future, be all at Peace, or all at War, with other Nations at the &s;ame Time.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>You may remember it was &s;tipulated, in the Conferences held la&s;t Summer, that all the Pri&s;oners you had taken &s;hould be brought to this Council-Fire, and there delivered up; and as you have only delivered up five Pri&s;oners, and I am &s;ure many more have been taken, I de&s;ire to know why they have not been brought; they are our own Fle&s;h and Blood, and we cannot be ea&s;y whil&s;t they are kept in Captivity.</P>

<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>You have opened your Heart, and &s;hewn us the Rea&s;ons you thought you had for differin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> with us: You have done well in &s;peaking &s;o plainly on that Head; but you &s;hould have made your Complaint to us before you lifted your Hand to &s;trike, and that might have pre|vented the Mi&s;chief.

<P>I am but lately come among you; the Grievances you mention are of old Date.

<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I DESIRE you will hear me a few a Words with Patience. You may remember I of|ten de&s;ired you to endeavour to apprehend me aright, when I am &s;peaking of Matters of Importance.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>Hear me with Patience; I am going to u&s;e a Compari&s;on, in order to repre&s;ent to you the better what we ought to do.</P>
<P>When you chu&s;e a Spot of Ground for Planting, you fir&s;t prepare the Ground, the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> you put the Seed into the Earth; but if you don't take Pains afterwards, you will not obtain Fruit.&mdash;To In&s;tance, in the <HI>Indian Corn,</HI> which is mine (meaning a native Plant of thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Country) I, as is cu&s;tomary, put &s;even Grains in one Hill, yet, without further Care, it wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> come to nothing, tho' the Ground be good; tho' at the Beginning I take prudent Steps, ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> if I neglect it afterwards, tho' it may grow up to Stalks and Leaves, and there may be the Appearance of Ears, there will only be Leaves and Cobs.&mdash;In like Manner, in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> pre&s;ent Bu&s;ine&s;s, tho' we have begun well, yet if we hereafter u&s;e not prudent Means, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;hall not have Succe&s;s an&s;werable to our Expectations.&mdash;God, that is above, hath furni&s;he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> us both with Powers and Abilities.&mdash;As for my own Part, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, to my Shame, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> have not made &s;uch Improvements of the Power given me as I ought; but as I look on you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to be more highly favoured from above than I am, I would de&s;ire you, that we would join ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Endeavours to promote the good Work; and that the Cau&s;e of our Unea&s;ine&s;s, begun in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Times of our Forefathers, may be removed; and if you look into your Hearts, and act according to the Abilities given you, you will know the Grounds of our Unea&s;ine&s;s i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ome Mea&s;ure from what I &s;aid before, in the Compari&s;on of the Fire, that tho' I was but a Boy, yet I would according to my Abilities bring a few Chips; &s;o with Regard to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Corn, I can do but little, you may a great deal; therefore let all of us, Men, Women and Children, a&s;&s;i&s;t in pulling up the Weeds, that nothing may hinder the Corn from growing to Perfection.

<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I de&s;ire you will attend to the&s;e few Words, and I will, with all Diligence, endeavour t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> tell you the Truth; the great Log you mentioned, when kindled, will make a great Flame but it will not kindle of it&s;elf, nor continue flaming, unle&s;s there be Air and Leaves, as wel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> as Coals to make it kindle.

<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>Take Pains therefore, and though you are a Governor, do not put off the&s;e Things from Time to Time, as our Forefathers did.</P>
<P>The Interpreter was de&s;ired to tell, in other Words, what was the Meaning of what wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;aid in the two la&s;t Articles; and having reque&s;ted Leave of <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> he &s;aid, he alluded to the Beginning of the War; the Quarrels between the King of <HI>France,</HI> and the King o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>England,</HI> and their People on both Sides, and that their young Men were deluded by th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>French</HI>; this was the fir&s;t and principal Cau&s;e, tho' other Things helped to make the Blo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;all quicker and heavier.</P>

<P><PB N="29" REF="007923_0028_102E0259E007EF98" MS="y"><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I will now in a few Words, according to my Abilities, give you an An&s;wer. You de&s;ired me to acquaint you what the Grounds of my Unea&s;ine&s;s were, and I complied, tho' it was not the main Thing which I came about. But when you put me in mind, I was plea&s;ed, for before I thought it not proper to mention it in the&s;e difficult Times; it was not the Cau&s;e of the Stroke, tho' it was the Foundation of our Unea&s;ine&s;s. Now, Brother, in An|&s;wer to your Que&s;tion, What will &s;atisfy us? It is not u&s;ual, nor rea&s;onable, nor can I tell you what the Damage is, and adju&s;t, as in a Ballance, the true Value at that Time and the&s;e Times; formerly it might be lighter, but being delayed, it is now the heavier; the Intere&s;t is to be added. Be&s;ides, there are many more concerned in this Matter, not now pre&s;ent; and tho' many who have &s;uffered are now in the Grave, yet their De&s;cendants feel the Weight, and the more now for the Time they have waited.</P>
<P>Al&s;o, Brother, I require you would throw down the Fence that confines &s;ome of my Brethren and Relations in the <HI>Jer&s;eys,</HI> that they may, if they &s;ee Cau&s;e, come and &s;ee their Relations. I do not want to compel any of them to come, or to &s;tay again&s;t their Will. If they are inclined to &s;tay and live among the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> I am quite willing they &s;hould come back again; but I want they &s;hould come and &s;ee me, that thereby I may convince their Relations, and the other Nations afar off, that I am now treating with, that they are not Servants, but a free People.</P>
<P>I do not reque&s;t that all Men, Women and Children &s;hould come; but &s;ome, or as many as may be &s;ufficient to convince other Nations that they are not confined, but have Liberty as well as we: In particular, one called <HI>Philip,</HI> he has a Wife, and Relations among us; to my Grief I heard he was carried to Goal, and there confined with &s;ome others, and put to Death; but I under&s;tand the Account of his Death was fal&s;e. I de&s;ire he may have Liberty to come and &s;ee his Relations. I al&s;o reque&s;t that you would apply to the Governor on the other Side the River (<HI>viz.</HI> of the <HI>Jer&s;eys</HI>) and to u&s;e your utmo&s;t En|deavours with him, that he would give them Leave to come, and that they may come under your Protection, be they more or le&s;s, in the great Road to us opened by this Province.</P>
<P>But though you &s;hould not do this, yet I will u&s;e my utmo&s;t Endeavours to bring you down your Pri&s;oners, there are only two in my Power. You may hear otherwi&s;e, but I de|clare I have no more than two in my Power: There are more in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of others, and the&s;e, with your A&s;&s;i&s;tance, I may be able to bring down; and I will endeavour to ga|ther and &s;coop in as many as I can, but I &s;hall want your Help to do it.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I have to reque&s;t you, that you would give Liberty to all Per&s;ons and Friends to &s;earch into the&s;e Matters; as we are all Children of the Mo&s;t High, we &s;hould endeavour to a&s;&s;i&s;t and make u&s;e of one another, and not only &s;o, but from what I have heard, I believe there is a future State be&s;ides this Fle&s;h; now I endeavour to act on both the&s;e Principles, and will, according to what I have promi&s;ed, if the Great Spirit &s;pare my Life, come next Spring, with as great a Force of <HI>Indians</HI> as I can get, to your Satisfaction.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>By this String now delivered, and lying before you, I a&s;&s;ure you I have &s;poken on all Mat|ters the be&s;t I could, according to my mean Capacity and Abilities. I &s;hall depend on my Interpreter, who I believe is an hone&s;t Man, but I think it prudent, in order to prevent Mi&s;|under&s;tandings, that I &s;hould be furni&s;hed with a Copy of what is done, as well in the Con|ferences held here la&s;t Summer as at this Time; for though I am not able to read, yet others may; it will be a great Satisfaction to have it in my Power to &s;hew to others what has pa&s;&s;ed between this Government and me: What is committed to Writing will not ea&s;ily be lo&s;t, and will be of great U&s;e to all, and better regarded; and I would have the Names and Seals of all that have been concerned in tran&s;acting this Bu&s;ine&s;s put to it: I do not de&s;ire a Copy now, but that it may be ready for me when I come again.&mdash;The Interpreter, <HI>Pump&s;hire,</HI> informed the Governor, that what <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> was going to &s;ay was not material, or of much Impor|tance, as it related to him&s;elf; adding, though he might be con&s;idered as a &s;imple Man, yet throughout all this Affair he had acted uprightly and hone&s;tly.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I will &s;peak in Favour of the Interpreter; he acted as &s;uch in Governor <HI>Morris</HI>'s Time as well as yours; and I am plea&s;ed with his Conduct on both Occa&s;ions.&mdash;If we &s;hould have any further Bu&s;ine&s;s to tran&s;act, I de&s;ire he may be employed.&mdash;You know he lives in another Province, and is on that Account at &s;ome Expence; reward him well for his Services; and do it well for my Sake; but I &s;hall leave it to you.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="007923_0029_102E025C33375018" MS="y"><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I have &s;omething, though of no great Con&s;equence, yet to mention. I am in low Cir|cum&s;tances, and have not Things &s;uitable; I wi&s;h I had&mdash;however, I have fifteen Deer Skins, which, as I &s;ee you love to have your Hands covered, I pre&s;ent you, to make Gloves of, or for any other U&s;e you &s;hall think proper. Eighty fine large Ones were brought at fir&s;t, but on our Journey from <HI>Diabogo</HI> to <HI>Wioming,</HI> &s;ome of the <HI>Indians</HI> with me were &s;o di&s;cou|raged by Alarms, that they returned home, and took with them all but the Fifteen, which, I de&s;ire your Acceptance of.</P>
<P>The Governor returned him Thanks, and told him, he accepted of them as a Mark of his Affection, without regard to the Value of the Skins.&mdash;He then reminded <HI>Teedyu&s;cung,</HI> that it was intended the Goods &s;hould have been delivered Ye&s;terday, but as it grew late, and the Room in which they &s;at at Dinner was &s;o &s;mall, it was agreed they &s;hould be brought here, and delivered, which was done, the Li&s;ts read, and the <HI>Indians</HI> left to divide the Goods.</P>

<P>Only one Thing of what was &s;aid Ye&s;terday requires an An&s;wer, which I am now going to give you.</P>

<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>If any of our <HI>Indians</HI> &s;hall incline to come into the Province, and live among their Bre|thren, the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> I do now a&s;&s;ure you, that they &s;hall be kindly received and &s;upported, and live together in one Place, the mo&s;t convenient that can be got for the Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Or as there is now a &s;trong Fort at <HI>Shamokin,</HI> built at the Reque&s;t of your Uncles, the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> for the Protection of the Friendly <HI>Indians,</HI> I propo&s;e to have a Store of Goods in it, the Direction and Management of which will be given to an hone&s;t Man, who &s;hall not be &s;uffered to impo&s;e upon the <HI>Indians</HI>; and I &s;hall be glad all our Friendly <HI>Indians,</HI> who are &s;cattered and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed in the&s;e trouble&s;ome Tim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, will come and live near it; there they will be protected from the <HI>French</HI>; there they will have a large uninhabited Country to hunt in; and there they may be furni&s;hed with Clothes, and all other Nece&s;&s;aries of Life, at the ca&s;ie&s;t Rates.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>You know that at the la&s;t Treaty the Road was opened for us to go to each other; I now give you this Belt to pre&s;erve the Communication free and clear of all Ob&s;tructions, let there be nothing in it that can hurt the Feet, or wound the Body of either.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>Since I &s;et out, I have heard of the Death of &s;everal of our <HI>Indian</HI> Friends by the Small|pox at <HI>l'hiladelphia,</HI> and particularly Captain <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> is dead, who was very in&s;trumental, and joined with you as Agent, in carrying on this good Work of Peace. I wipe away your Tears; I take the Grief from your Hearts; I cover the Graves; eternal Re&s;t be with their Spirits.</P>

<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>Peace is now &s;ettled between us by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Mo&s;t High; but the <HI>Indians</HI> in the <HI>French</HI> Intere&s;t &s;till commit Murders on our Frontiers, and our Soldiers are in Pur&s;uit of them. I de&s;ire you will order your young Men not to &s;traggle about, but keep in the &s;traight Path to your Towns, &s;o that they may not be mi&s;taken by our Soldiers for <HI>French Indians.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> thanked the Governor for his kind Speeches, and &s;aid, he was very glad that the Governor had thought of &s;ending two Me&s;&s;engers with him for the Pri&s;oners, and pro|mi&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t them.</P>
<P>After the Condolance made on Captain <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI>'s Death, the King made an Addre&s;s as is u&s;ual to the other <HI>Indians</HI> on this mou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nful Occa&s;ion: They continued &s;ilent for &s;ome Time, and then one of the olde&s;t of them &s;poke an Exhortation, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the Nature of a Funeral Ora|tion; after which <HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> expre&s;&s;ed to the Governor the great Satisfaction given to him at his condoling the Death of Captain <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> who, he &s;aid, was a good Man, and had promoted the good Work of Peace with great Care; his Death would put him in Mind of his Duty, as it &s;hould al&s; of us.</P>
<P>He then &s;poke in a warm and pathetick Manner in Favour of the Peace now &s;ettled, and implored the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Mo&s;t High to bring it to Perfection.</P>
<P>The Governor under&s;tanding that &s;everal of the <HI>Indians</HI> inclined to &s;tay, de&s;ired <HI>Teedyu&s;|cung</HI> to give him the Names of &s;uch as would live with their Brethren the <HI>Engli&s;h.&mdash;Teedy|u&s;cung,</HI> mi&s;taking the Governor, as if he had &s;aid, they mu&s;t &s;tay, an&s;wered, &s;miling, he did not under&s;tand any <HI>Indians</HI> were to be forced to &s;tay, but left to their Liberty.

The Governor &s;et the Matter Right, thanked him, and wi&s;hed him well; took his Leave of him, &s;aying, they had met and parted Friends, and he hoped they would meet again as good Friends as now.</P>
<P><HI>Teedyu&s;cung</HI> &s;hewed great Plea&s;ure in his Countenance, and took a kind Leave of the Go|vernor and all pre&s;ent.</P>

<HEAD><HI>EXTRACT from the Minutes of the Hou&s;e of</HI> REPRESENTATIVES <HI>of the Province <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> Penn&s;ylvania, January <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">7&punc; 1757</HEAD>
<Q>The four Provincial Commi&s;&s;ioners Members of this Hou&s;e, who were appointed to attend the Governor at the late Conference with the <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Ea&s;ton,</HI> pre&s;ented a Pape<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to the Hou&s;e, which was read, and is as follows, viz.</Q>
<P>WE, the Committee, appointed to attend the Governor at the Conferences with th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Ea&s;ton,</HI> in <HI>November</HI> la&s;t, have peru&s;ed the Copy of tho&s;e Conferences drawn up and &s;igned by the Secretary, and &s;aid before the Hou&s;e;</P>
<P>And as we apprehend it of Importance to the Province, that the Complaints made by the <HI>Indians,</HI> whether ju&s;tly founded or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> be fully repre&s;ented, and their Sen&s;e of them under&s;tood, we think it nece&s;&s;ary to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erve to the Hou&s;e, that we conceive the Warmth and Earne&s;tne&s;s with which they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ted on the Wrongs that had been done them in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Purcha&s;es of Land, are much too <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tly expre&s;&s;ed in this Account of the Conference. Tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> we were not pre&s;ent at the palliating Hear&s;ay Accounts, of the Walking Purcha&s;e, &s;aid to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> given the Governor by Mr. <HI>Wei&s;er,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Peters,</HI> on the Fourteenth of <HI>November</HI>; tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> by the concluding Paragraphs und<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that Date, it may &s;eem as if we were: But we wel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> remember, that the Tran&s;action of that Walk was at <HI>Ea&s;ton</HI> univer&s;ally given up as unfair and not to be defended, even from the Accounts of &s;ome of our own People who were pre&s;ent at the Walking; even the Secretary, tho' he did &s;ay, that he <HI>believed</HI> Satisfaction was afterwards made the <HI>Indians,</HI> and that this was the only In&s;tance in which any Foun|dation of Complaint had ever been given them, yet, this he allowed was (in his own Words) <HI>unworthy of any Government.</HI> We would farther ob&s;erve, that when <HI>Teedya&s;cung</HI> claimed the Lands, even tho&s;e on which the Conferences were held, no Objection was made that neither he, nor any with him, had any Right to them; nor did we ever under&s;tand h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Rea&s;on, for not accepting Satis&s;action to be as repre&s;ented in the &s;econd Paragraph under <HI>November</HI> 17, for that "<HI>the People</HI> to whom the Land belonged were ab&s;ent;"&mdash;but fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that many of them were ab&s;ent, and tho&s;e who were ab&s;ent, had not impowered him to a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for them in that Matter; but he would endeavour to bring them in the Spring.</P>
<P>The Offer of the Commi&s;&s;ioners to furni&s;h the Means of making the <HI>Indians</HI> immediate Satisfaction, not being fully related, we think it nece&s;&s;ary to add, That the Rea&s;ons we gave the Governor for that Offer, were, 1. The Ab&s;ence and great Di&s;tance of the Proprietaries, who being the &s;ole Purcha&s;ers of Land from the <HI>Indians,</HI> in this Province, ought, if the <HI>Indians</HI> were injured in &s;uch Purcha&s;es, alone to make the Satisfaction; but their Agents here had not the nece&s;&s;ary Powers. 2. For that Promi&s;es [&s;uch being propo&s;ed] of enquiring into <HI>Indian</HI> Complaints, and doing them Right hereafter, had been &s;o often made in other<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Governments, and &s;o little ob&s;erved, we imagined they could be of no Weight, and would rather be looked upon as a Denial of Ju&s;tic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and therefore, we thought it better, as their Demands are &s;eldom very high, to make them immediate Reparation for the Injuries they &s;uppo&s;ed they had received, and we would furni&s;h the Goods, and ri&s;que the Proprietarie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> repaying their Value to the Province. The Secretary then told us, that he thought our Pro|po&s;al very con&s;iderate and well-judged; that he was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the Prop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">etaries would think them|&s;elves obliged to us, and repay the Money with Thanks: The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> made, but not accepted for the Rea&s;ons above<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">entioned.
