<HEAD>Some ob&s;ervations on the Importation and pur|cha&s;e of Negroes.</HEAD>
<P>IN ancient Times it was the Practice of many Nations, when at war with each other, to &s;ell the Pri&s;oners they <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> in Battle, in order to defray the Expences of the War. This unchri&s;tian or rather inhuman Practice, after many Ages continuance, is at length generally aboli&s;hed by the Chri&s;tian Powers of Europe, but &s;till continues among &s;ome of the Nations of A&s;ia and Africa, and to our &s;ad Experience we find it al&s;o practi&s;ed by the Natives of America. In the pre&s;ent war, how many of our poor Country Men are dragged to Bondage and &s;old for Slaves; how many mourn, a Husband, a Wife, a Child, a Parent or &s;ome near Relation taken from them; and were we to follow them a little farther, and &s;ee them expo&s;ed to &s;ale and bought up to be made a Gain of, what Heart &s;o hard that would not melt with Sympathy and Sorrow: And could we hear the Purcha&s;ers, for the &s;ake of Gain, pu&s;h|ing on the Savages to captivate our People, what inhuman wretches &s;hould we call them, what Puni&s;hment &s;hould we <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> their Guilt de&s;erved! But while our Hearts are affected for our Brethren and Relations, while we feel for our own Fle&s;h and Blood, let us extend our Thoughts to others, and allow me, gentle Reader! to recommend to thy &s;erious Con&s;ideration, a Practice that prevails among &s;everal Nations who call them&s;elves Chri&s;tians, and I am &s;orry to &s;ay it, in which we as a Nation are deeply engag|ed, &amp; which is of &s;uch a Nature, as that nothing can be more incon&s;i&s;tant with the Doctrines and Practice of our meek Lord and Ma&s;ter, nor &s;tained with a deeper Dye or In|ju&s;tice, Cruelty and Oppre&s;&s;ion, I mean the SLAVE TRADE, the purcha&s;ing and bringing the poor Negroes from their Native Land, and &s;ubjecting them to a State of perpetual Bondage, and that often the mo&s;t cruel and op|pre&s;&s;ive. And this carried on cheifly at the in&s;tigation of tho&s;e to whom the Promulgation of the merciful, pure, and holy Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t Je&s;us was committed. Will not the ju&s;t Judge of all the Earth vi&s;it for all this? Or dare we &s;ay, that this very Practice is not one Cau&s;e of
<PB N="3" REF="008298_0003_102E78A942CD9338">
the Calamities we at pre&s;ent &s;uffer. And that the Captivity of our People is not to teach us to feel for others, and to induce us to di&s;courage a Trade, by which many Thou&s;ands are Yearly captivated? Evils do not ari&s;e out of the Du&s;t, nor does the Almighty willingly af|flict the Children of Men; But when a People offend as a Nation, or in a publick Capacity, the Ju&s;tice of his moral Government requires that as a Nation they be puni&s;hed, which is generally done by War, Famine or Pe&s;tilence. I know there are many Arguments offered in favour of the Purcha&s;ers, but they are all drawn from Avarice or ill founded, none will &s;tand the Te&s;t of that divine Rule, <HI>To do unto all Men, as we would they &s;hould do unto us.</HI> Without Purcha&s;ers, there would be no Trade; and con&s;equently every Purcha&s;er as he encou|rages the Trade, becomes partaker in the Guilt of it, and that they may &s;ee what a deep dye the Guilt is of, I beg leave to quote &s;ome Extracts from the Writings of Per&s;ons of Note, who have been long employed in the African Trade, and who&s;e Situation and Office in the Factories will not admit any to que&s;tion the Truth of what thy relate. By the&s;e we &s;hall &s;ee, that in order to get Slaves, the Europeans &s;ettled at the Factories in Afri|ca, encourage Wars, and promote the Practice of &s;tealing Men, Women and Children, which they readily purcha&s;e without any Regard to Ju&s;tice, Equity or any of the ten|der Ties of Nature.</P>
<P><HI>William Bo&s;man,</HI> Factor for the Dutch AFRICAN Com|pany, at the Factory at DELMINA, who wrote an Ac|count of that Country, now more than fifty Years pa&s;t, tells his Readers
<Q>That the Booty which the Negro Soldiers aim at in their Wars, are Ornaments of Gold and Pri&s;oners of War, in Order to &s;ell them for Slaves at Plea&s;ure, that many of the Inhabitants depend on Plun|der and the Slave-Trade; and that when Ve&s;&s;els arrive, if they have no Stock of Slaves, the Factors tru&s;t the In|habitants with Coods for the Value of one or two Hundred Slaves, which they &s;end into the inland Country in Order to buy Slaves, at all Markets even &s;ometimes two Hundred Miles deep in the Country,
<PB N="4" REF="008298_0004_102E78DD809FBAA0">
where Markets of Men were kept in the &s;ame Manner as tho&s;e of Bea&s;ts with us, He farther adds. That, in his Time, the Europeans furni&s;hed the Negroes with an incredible Quantity of Fire-Arms and Gunpowder, which was then the Cheif vendible Merchandize there.</Q>
This was the State of the Negro Trade when <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">man</HI> wrote his Account of GUINEA, which, as I have already &s;aid, was more than fifty Years ago; Since that Time the Trade is prodigiously augmented, there being now more than ten Ships to one that was then imployed in it: And as the Demand for Slaves has augmented, &s;o have the Negroes been the more induced not only to wage War one with another, but al&s;o to put in practice the mo&s;t ba&s;e and inhuman Methods, in Order to get their unhappy Countrymen into their Power, that they may &s;ell them to the European Traders.</P>
<P><HI>John Barbot,</HI> Agent General of the French Royal Afri|can Company, in his Acc. printed 1732 writes as follows.
<Q>Tho&s;e Slaves &s;old by the Negroes, are for the mo&s;t Part Pri&s;oners of War, taken either in fight or pur&s;uit, or in the incur&s;ions they make into their Enemies Terri|tories; others are &s;tolen away by their own Contry-Men, and &s;ome there are who will &s;ell their own Children, Kindred or Neighbours. This has often been &s;een, and to compa&s;s it, they de&s;ire the Per&s;on they intend to &s;ell, to help them in carrying &s;omething to the Factory by Way of Trade, and when there, the Per&s;on &s;o deluded, not under&s;tanding the Language, is &s;old and delivered up as a Slave, notwith&s;tanding all his Re&s;i&s;tance and ex|claiming again&s;t the Treachery. Abundance of little Blacks of both &s;exes are al&s;o &s;tolen away by their Neigh|bours, when found abroad on the Roads, or in the Woods; or el&s;e in the Corn Fields, at the Time of the Year when their Parents keep them there all Day, to &s;care away the devouring &s;mall Birds,</Q></P>
<P>A Per&s;on of Candour and undoubted Credit now living in <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> who was on a trading Voyage, on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Guinea,</HI> about &s;even Years ago, was an Eye Wit|ne&s;s of the Mi&s;ery and De&s;olation which the Purcha&s;e of Slaves occa&s;ions in that Country, a particular In&s;tance of
<PB N="5" REF="008298_0005_102E85AF67E151F0">
which he relates in the following Manner viz.
<Q>Being on that Coa&s;t, at a Place called <HI>Ba&s;alia,</HI> the Commander of the Ve&s;&s;el according to Cu&s;tom &s;ent a Per&s;on on Shore, with a Pre&s;ent to the King of the Country, acquainting him with their arrival, and letting him know that they wanted a Cargo of Slaves: The King promi&s;ed to fur|ni&s;h them with Slaves, and in Order to do it, &s;et out to go to War again&s;t his Enemies, de&s;igning al&s;o to &s;urprize &s;ome Town and take all the People Pri&s;oners. Some|time after the King &s;ent them Word he had not yet met with the de&s;ired &s;ucce&s;s, having been twice repul&s;ed, in attempting to break up two Towns; but that he &s;till hoped to procure a Number of Slaves for them; and in this De&s;ign he per&s;i&s;ted, till he met his Enemies in the Field, where a Battle was fought, which la&s;ted three Days, during which Time the Engagement was &s;o bloody, that 4500 were &s;lain on the Spot. Think, &s;ays the Author, what a pitiable &s;ight it was, to &s;ee the Widows weeping over their lo&s;t Hu&s;bands, and Orphans deploring the lo&s;s of their Fathers &amp;c.</Q>
What mu&s;t we think of that cruel Wretch who occa&s;ioned &s;uch a Scene of Mi&s;ery, or what of tho&s;e who for the &s;ake of Gain in&s;tigated him to it.</P>
<P>N. N. <HI>Bru<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> a noted Traveller, a Narative of who&s;e Travels is to be met with in a new Collection of Voyages, printed by the King's Authority in the Year 1745, Tells his Readers;
<Q>That the Europeans are far from de&s;iring to act as Peace-Makers, among&s;t the Negroes, which would be acting contrary to their Intere&s;t, &s;ince the greater the Wars, the more Slaves are procured.</Q>
He al&s;o gives an Account of the Manner in which the Slaves are got, in the Place where he then was, in the following Terms viz.
<Q>When a Ve&s;&s;el arrives, the King of the Country &s;ends a Troop of Guards to &s;ome Village, which they &s;urround; then &s;eizing as many as they have Orders for, they bind them and &s;end them away to the Ship, were the Ship's Mark being put upon them, they are hear'd of no more. They u&s;ually carry the Infants in Sacks, and gag the Men and Women for fear they &s;hould alarm the Villages, thro' which they are carried: For, &s;ays he, the&s;e Actions are ne|ver committed in the Villages near the Factories, which it is the King's Intere&s;t not to ruin, but in tho&s;e up the Country.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="008298_0006_102E85B45A8A7EA0">Al&s;o, <HI>Jo&s;eph Randal,</HI> in his Book of Geography, prin|ted in the Year 1744, in the Account he gives of the <HI>Guinea</HI> Trade, after generally confirming the above Ac|count, adds:
<Q>That in time of full Peace nothing is more common, than for the Negroes of one Nation to &s;teal tho&s;e of another, and &s;ell them to the Europeans. There has, &s;ays he, been In&s;tances among&s;t the Negroes of Children &s;elling their Fathers and Mothers, when they have been weary of them, and wanted to enjoy what they had; which I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;ays that Author, gave birth to the Laws, by which the Children are not to inherit the Goods or E&s;tates of their Fathers and Mothers. Thus, the&s;e poor Creatures are brought down to the Coa&s;t to be &s;old to the Merchants of Europe. When the Price is agreed upon, which for an able bodied Man, under thirty five Years of age, may be about 5 Pounds, the Women a fifth Part le&s;s, and the Children in proportion to their Age, the European Merchants brand them with hot Irons to di&s;tingui&s;h them, and looks the poor wret|ches up in &s;ome Pri&s;on, till they can be &s;ent on board; When they come to America, they are di&s;po&s;ed of, &s;ome to the Spaniards to work in the Mines, (for the Engli&s;h are obliged by the A&s;&s;iento Contract, to deliver thirty Thou&s;and Slaves every Year to the Spaniards, and the re&s;t are &s;old to the Planters in <HI>America.</HI>) It is thought that the Engli&s;h tran&s;port annually near fifty Thou&s;and of tho&s;e unhappy Creatures, and the other European Nations together about Two Hundred Thou&s;and more.</Q>
Let but any one reflect that each Individual of this Num|ber had &s;ome tender attachment which was broken by this cruel Separation; &s;ome Parent or Wife, who had not even the Opportunity of mingling Tears in a parting Embrace; or perhaps &s;ome Infant whom his Labour was to feed and Vigilance protect,; or let any con&s;ider what it is to lo&s;e a Child, a Husband or any dear Relation, and then let them &s;ay what they mu&s;t think of tho&s;e who are ingaged in, or encourage &s;uch a Trade. By the fore mentioned Accounts it appears, how by various perfidious, and cruel Methods, the unhappy Negroes are in&s;laved, and that mo&s;tly, by the Procurement of tho&s;e called Chri&s;tians,
<PB N="7" REF="008298_0007_102E85B71AB43A38">
and violently rent from the tendere&s;t Ties of Nature, to toil in hard Labour, often without &s;ufficient Supplies of Food, and under hard Ta&s;kma&s;ters, and this mo&s;tly to up|hold the Luxury or Covetou&s;ne&s;s of proud &s;elfi&s;h Men, without any Hope of ever &s;eeing again their native Land; or an end to their Mi&s;eries. Oh ye cruel Ta&s;kma&s;ters! ye hard-hearted Oppre&s;&s;ors! will not God hear their Cry; and what &s;hall ye do; when God ri&s;eth up; and when he vi&s;iteth; what will ye an&s;wer him? <HI>Did not he that made you make them? and did not one fa&s;hion you in the Womb?</HI></P>
<P>Hitherto I have con&s;idered the Trade as incon&s;i&s;tent with the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, contrary to natural Ju&s;tice, and the common feelings of Humanity, and productive of infinite Calamities to many Thou&s;and Families, nay to many Na|tions, and con&s;equently offen&s;ive to God the Father of all Mankind. Yet it mu&s;t be allowed, there are &s;ome well minded Per&s;ons, into who&s;e Hands &s;ome of the Negroes have fallen, either by Inheritance, Executor&s;hip, or even &s;ome perhaps purely from Charitable Motives, who rather de&s;ire to Manage wi&s;ely for their good, than to make Gain by their Labour; the&s;e I truly &s;ympathize with, for, con&s;idering the general &s;ituation of tho&s;e unhappy People, they have indeed a difficult Path to tread.</P>
<P>I might next con&s;ider the Trade as it is de&s;tructive of the Welfare of human Society, and incon&s;i&s;tent with the Peace and Pro&s;perity of a Country; as by it the number of natural Enemies mu&s;t be encrea&s;ed, and the Place of tho&s;e taken up who would be its &s;upport and &s;ecurity. Or I might &s;hew from innumerable Examples, how it introduces Idlene&s;s, di&s;courages Marriage, corrupts the Youth, and ruins and debauches Morals. I might likewi&s;e expo&s;e the weakne&s;s of tho&s;e Arguments, which are com|monly advanced in Order to vindicate the Purcha&s;ers, &s;uch, as their being Slaves in their own Country and there|fore may be &s;o to us, or that they are made acquainted with Chri&s;tianity in lieu of their Liberty, or that the la&s;t Purcha&s;er will u&s;e them better than they formerly were: But not to mention, that the&s;e are only vain pretences, that the true Motive of encouraging the Trade is &s;elfi&s;h Avarice; to &s;ay nothing of the weakne&s;s of the Argument.
<PB N="8" REF="008298_0008_102E85B89E72FBA0">
That becau&s;e others do ill, we may do &s;o too; or the ab&s;urdity of recommending the Chri&s;tian Religion by In|ju&s;tice and a di&s;regard to the Rights and Liberties of Mankind, or the Encouragement that every new Purcha&s;er gives to a Trade altogether unju&s;t and iniquitous. What is already &s;aid, will I hope be &s;ufficient to prevent any con&s;i|derate Chri&s;tian from being, in any Degree, defiled with a Gain &s;o full of Horrors, and &s;o palpably incon&s;i&s;tent with the Go&s;pel of our ble&s;&s;ed LORD and Saviour JESUS CHRIST, which breaths nothing but Love and Goodwill to all Men of every Nation, Kindred, Tongue and People.</P>

<HEAD>Extract from the Epi&s;tle of the yearly Meeting of Friends, held at <HI>London</HI> in the Year <HI>1758.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WE fervently warn All in Profe&s;&s;ion with us, that
<Q>they be careful to avoid being any Way concern|ed, in reaping the unrighteous Profits ari&s;ing from that iniquitous Practice of Dealing in Negroes &amp; other Slaves; whereby in the original Purcha&s;e one Man &s;elleth Ano|ther, as he doth the Bea&s;ts that peri&s;hes, without any bet|ter Preten&s;ion to a Property in him, than that of &s;upe|rior Force; in direct Violation of the Go&s;pel-Rule, which teacheth Every One to do as they would be done by, and to do Good unto All; being the Rever&s;e of that covetous Di&s;po&s;ition, which furni&s;hes Encourage|ment to tho&s;e ignorant People to perpetuate their &s;avage Wars, in Order to &s;upply the Demands of this mo&s;t un|natural Traffick, whereby great Numbers of Mankind, free by Nature, are &s;ubjected to inextricable Bondage; and which hath often been ob&s;erved, to fill their Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ors with Haughtine&s;s, Tyranny, Luxury and Barbari|ty, corrupting the Minds, and deba&s;ing the Morals of their Children, to the un&s;peakable Prejudice of Religion and Virtue, and the Exclu&s;ion of that holy Spirit of uni|ver&s;al Love, Meekne&s;s and Charity, which is the un|changeable Nature and the Glory of true Chri&s;tianity. We therefore can do no le&s;s than, with the greate&s;t Ear|ne&s;tne&s;s, to impre&s;s it upon Friends every where, that they endeavour to keep their Hands clear of this uprigh|teous Gain of Oppre&s;&s;ion.</Q></P>

<Q><P>Love not the World, neither the Things that are in the World. If any Man loves the World the Love of the Father is not in him</P>
<BIBL><HI>1 John 2, 15.</HI></BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IF any Man will be a Di&s;ciple of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t. <HI>He mu&s;t deny him&s;elf and take up his Cro&s;s dayly.</HI> He mu&s;t be willing to lo&s;e that Life, tho&s;e Affections and De&s;ires we naturally have to that which is earthly and &s;en&s;ual. Hence it appears, that one of the greate&s;t Defection any one can make from Chri&s;tianity, is by indulging in them &s;elves a worldly Spirit, a Spirit that &s;eeks its Joy and Con&s;olation in the Riches, Honours, and Friend&s;hips of this World: And indeed this &s;eems to have been the chief Inlet, of that &s;tream of Corruption, which in different Ages has over&s;pread the Chri&s;tian Churches.</P>
<P>Great Noi&s;e has been made about Schi&s;ms and Here&s;ies, but the true Foundation of all the&s;e Evils, the Here&s;y of all Here&s;ies is and has in all Ages been, a proud, &s;elfi&s;h worldly Spirit, more or le&s;s cloaked under the Appearance of Zeal, with which it has not only deceived many, but has often deceived it &s;elf. We are called to love God with all our Heart, and with all our Strength, to turn from every Thing, that leads not to God and his holy Will; with all the De&s;ire, Delight and Longing of our Heart, to give up our&s;elves wholly to the Light and holy Spirit of God; plea&s;ed with nothing in this World, but as it gives Time and Place, and Occa&s;ion of doing and being that, which our heavenly Fa|ther would have us to do and be, &s;eeking for no Happine&s;s from this earthly fallen Life, but that of overcoming all its Spirits and Tempers.</P>
<P>The ancient Philo&s;ophers began all their Virtue in a total Renunciation of the Spirit of this World; they &s;aw with the Eyes of Heaven, that Darkne&s;s was not more contrary to Light, than the Spirit and Wi&s;dom of this World was con|trary to divine Wi&s;dom: Therefore they allowed of no Progre&s;s in Virtue, but &s;o far as a Man had overcome him|&s;elf, and the Spirit of this World. This gave a divine Soli|dity to all their In&s;tructions, and proved them to be Ma&s;ters of true Wi&s;dom. But the Doctrine of the Cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, the la&s;t, the highe&s;t, the mo&s;t fini&s;hing Stroke given to the Spirit of this World, that &s;peaks more in one Word, than
<PB N="10" REF="008298_0010_102E85BCCF5B5DB0">
all the Philo&s;ophy of volumnious Writers, is yet profe&s;&s;ed by tho&s;e, who are in more Friend&s;hip with the World, than was allowed to the Di&s;ciples of <HI>Pithagoras, Socrates, Plato</HI> or <HI>Epictetus.</HI> Nay, if tho&s;e ancient Sages were to &s;tart up among&s;t us with their divine Wi&s;dom, they would bid fair to be treated by the Sons of the Go&s;pel, if not by &s;ome Fa|thers of the Church, as dreaming Enthu&s;ia&s;ts. But, this is a &s;tanding Truth, the World can only love its own, and Wi&s;dom can only be ju&s;tified of her Children. The hea|ven born <HI>Epictetus</HI> told one of his Scholars, <HI>that then he might fir&s;t look upon him&s;elf as having made &s;ome true Profi|ciency in Virtue, when the World took him for a Fool;</HI> an Oracle like that, which &s;aid, the Wi&s;dom of this World is Fooli&s;hne&s;s with God.</P>
<P>If you a&s;k what is the Apo&s;tacy of the&s;e la&s;t Times, or whence is all the degeneracy of the pre&s;ent Chri&s;tian Church, it mu&s;t be placed to a worldly Spirit. If here you &s;ee open Wickedne&s;s, there only Form of Godline&s;s, if here &s;uperficial Holine&s;s, political Piety, crafty Prudence, there haughty Sanctity, partial Zeal, envious Orthodoxy, if al|mo&s;t every where, you &s;ee a Jewi&s;h Blindne&s;s, and Hard|ne&s;s of Heart, and the Church trading with the Go&s;pel, as vi&s;ibly, as the old Jews bought and &s;old Bea&s;ts in their Temple, all this is only &s;o many Forms, and proper Fruits of the worldly Spirit. This is the great Net, with which the Devil becomes a Fi&s;her of Men; and be a&s;&s;ured of this, that every Son of Man is in this Net, till through, and by the Spirit of Chri&s;t he breaks out of it. I &s;ay the Spirit of Chri&s;t, for nothing el&s;e can deliver him from it. If you tru&s;t to any Kind or Form of religious Ob&s;ervances, to any Kind of Learning, or Effort of human Prudence, and then I will tell you what your Ca&s;e will be, you will overcome one Temper of the World, only and merely by cleaving to ano|ther: For nothing can overcome or renounce the World, but &s;ingly, and &s;olely the Spirit of Chri&s;t. Hence it is, that many learned Men with all the rich Furniture of their Brain, live and die Slaves to the Spirit of this World, the Spirit of Chri&s;t is not the one only Thing that is the De&s;ire of their Hearts, and therefore their Learning only works in and with the Spirit of this World, and becomes it&s;elf no &s;mall Parts of the Vanity of Vanities.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="008298_0011_102E85C1DAE05348">Would you know the evil Nature and Effect of a Spirit given up to the World, and not &s;ubjected to the Spirit of Grace: You need only look at the ble&s;&s;ed Effect of a con|tinual State of Watching, a continual humble Application to God in the true Spirit of Prayer, for the one goes down|wards with the &s;ame Strength, as the other goes upward, the one betroths, and weds to an earthly Nature, with the &s;ame certainty, as the other e&s;pou&s;es, and unites to Chri&s;t. The Spirit of continual Watchings and Prayer, is a pre&s;&s;ing forth of the Soul out of this Earthly Life, it is a &s;tretching with all its De&s;ire after the Life of God, it is a Leaving as far as it can, all its own Spirit, to receive a Spi|rit from above, to be one Life, one Love, one Spirit with Chri&s;t in God. This Prayer which is an Emptying it&s;elf of all its own Lu&s;ts and natural Tempers, and an Opening it &s;elf for the Light and Love of God to enter into it, is the Prayer in the Name of Chri&s;t, to which nothing is denyed; for the Love which God bears to the Soul, is an eternal ne|ver cea&s;ing De&s;ire to open the Birth of his holy Word and Spirit in it, and &s;tays no longer till the Door of the Heart open for Him; and nothing does or can keep God out of the Soul, or hinder his Union with it, but the De&s;ire of the Heart&punc; turned from it. What the Soul de&s;ireth, that is the Fewel of its Fire, and as its Fewel is, &s;o is the Flame of its Life. As we &s;ow, we &s;hall reap; if to the Spirit, we &s;hall reap Life and Peace; if to the Fle&s;h, we &s;hall of the Fle&s;h reap Corruption. Wherever and in what&s;oever the Will chu&s;eth to dwell and delight, that becometh the Soul's Food, its Cloathing and Habitation. Since this is the Ca&s;e, let us &s;top a While, let our Hearing be turned into Feel|ing. Let us con&s;ider whether there is any Thing in Life, that de&s;erves a Thought, but how to keep in a continual State of Watching and Prayer, that we may attain to that Purity of Heart, which alone can &s;ee, find and po&s;&s;e&s;s God</P>

<HEAD>The ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of Self-Denial, Mortifica|tion and true Charity, in Order to follow our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour in the Regeneration, is al&s;o livingly &s;ett forth in the excellent Writings of a pious Member of the Church of <HI>England</HI> * of which I &s;hall here give &s;ome Extract: It being a Doctrine, which of all others appears at this Time the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to be &s;trongly inculcated.</HEAD>
<P>WHat Cau&s;e, &s;ays that Author, &s;hall we a&s;&s;ign for the Oppo&s;ition to Go&s;pel-Truths that appears among&s;t us, and for that Di&s;like to tho&s;e, who urge the Nece&s;&s;ity of Regeneration and of the &s;piritual Life? The true Rea|&s;on is nigh at Hand, tho' others are pretended: Such Doc|trines are contrary to the Maxims and Principles that go|vern the Hearts and Conduct of the Children of this Ge|neration, are at Variance with the fal&s;e Intere&s;ts of Fle&s;h and Blood, declare open War again&s;t the Kingdom of Self, and &s;trike at every Thing that is mo&s;t near and dear to cor|rupt Nature; and therefore carnal Men of every Denomi|nation think them&s;elves concerned in Character to oppo&s;e and di&s;credit &s;uch a Repre&s;entation of Chri&s;tianity. They can be zealous for Opinions, Forms, and an external Wor|&s;hip of any Kind, becau&s;e they leave them in quiet Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of their Ambition, their Covetou&s;ne&s;s, their Love of them&s;elves, and their Love of the World: They can rea|dily take up a Profe&s;&s;ion of Faith in a &s;uffering Saviour, nay bring them&s;elves to tru&s;t in an outward Covering of his Merits and Righteou&s;ne&s;s for Salvation, becau&s;e this co&s;ts them nothing; but to be cloathed with his Spirit of Hu|mility, Poverty and Self-denial; to renounce their own Wills in his Lowline&s;s, Meekne&s;s, and total Re&s;ignation to the Will of God, to mortify the fle&s;hly Appetites; to be crucified to the World; to &s;trip them&s;elves of all Com|placency and Sati&s;faction in tho&s;e Endowments, whether natural or acquired, which appear great and glorious in the Eyes both of them&s;elves and Others; and, in a Word, to take up their Cro&s;s, and nakedly follow a naked Chri&s;t in

the Regeneration: The&s;e are hard Savings, they cannot bear them: But Wi&s;dom is ju&s;tified of her Children; un|acceptable as the&s;e Doctrines are to Others&punc; yet to them, and in them too, they are the Power of God, and the Wi&s;dom of God. It was by &s;uch Fooli&s;hne&s;s of Preaching that Chri&s;t's Kingdom fir&s;t prevailed over the Kingdoms of this World; and it mu&s;t be by the &s;ame Doctrine, un|der the Influence of the &s;ame Spirit, that we can only hope for its Continuance to the End of it.</P>
<P>The Way to any good Degree of Perfection in the di|vine Life, lies thro' great Mortification and Self-denial: Some think it enough to get Doctrines into the Head; but till the Heart is in &s;ome Mea&s;ure purified by Faith, nothing is rightly done: And in Order to this, the Children of <HI>An<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">k,</HI> (tho&s;e corrupt Pa&s;&s;ions and Inclinations that war again&s;t the Soul,) mu&s;t be driven out, the Perver&s;ne&s;s of the Will broken, the Under&s;tanding &s;implified, the Pride of our Hearts plukt up by the Roots, and all the Cords that bind us to the World and the Things of it untwi&s;ted; in a Word, our Idols mu&s;t be ca&s;t out, and every cur&s;ed Thing removed that &s;eparates betwixt God and us; for the Pure in Heart, and they only &s;hall &s;ee God. It was by this Kind of holy Violence practi&s;ed on them&s;elves, that the Wor|thies both of the Old and New Te&s;tament, in all Ages of the Church, have laid hold on the Kingdom of Heaven been favoured with &s;uch rich Communications from God, and enabled to work &s;uch Wonders as &s;urpa&s;s the Belief of Many in this degenerate incredulous Age: And that a pre|paratory Di&s;cipline of Strictne&s;s and Severity is nece&s;&s;ary in Order to qualify us for any extraordinary Vouch&s;afements of Illumination and Grace, we may learn from the Schools in&s;tituted among the Jews for the Training up of Per&s;ons for the prophetic Office, where they were educated in great Ab&s;traction from the World, in the Government of their Pa&s;&s;ions, and the Mortification of their natural Pro|pen&s;ions, that being &s;o di&s;engaged from the common Im|pediments of a holy Life, they might be more at Liberty for Devotion and the Contemplation of heavenly Things, and by &s;uch previous Exerci&s;es become fit In&s;truments for the Holy Spirit, and more receptive of heavenly Wi&s;dom.

Thus came they out holy Enthu&s;ia&s;ts, Men of God fur|ni&s;hed to every good Word and Work, Scribes well in|&s;tructed unto the Kingdom of Heaven, and fearle&s;s of giv|ing Offence in the Way of Duty, even before Kings, be|ing no le&s;s qualified for Reproof and Correction, than for Doctrine and In&s;truction in Righteou&s;ne&s;s: Patterns the&s;e for all Per&s;ons of a religious Character, whether they live in Colleges or in Kings Hou&s;es; whether they attend on tho&s;e who go clothed in Purple and fine Linnen, and fare &s;umptuou&s;ly every Day. or are called forth to a more pro|mi&s;cuous Employment of their Office; for tho' the Di&s;pen|&s;ation of Prophecy as it re&s;pects the foretelling future E|vents, has a long Time cea&s;ed in the Church, yet the Cha|racter of Prophets in the Capacity of Declarers of God's Word and Will, and as Denouncers of his Judgments on all impenitents, even the mo&s;t dignified Offenders, is never to cea&s;e in it, neither is the Lord's Hand &s;hortned that it cannot extend Comfort and Courage, Light and Direction for the&s;e Purpo&s;es now as formerly: But, Alas! our Hearts are &s;traitned that they cannot receive it as they ought, and we are &s;o entangled, as to Many of us, with &s;uch an evil Covetou&s;ne&s;s after the Things of this Life, &s;o &s;tudious to &s;eek the Honour that cometh of Man, more than the Ho|nour that cometh of God, that we want Boldne&s;s to hold the Faith of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t without Re&s;pect of Per|&s;ons: For let Men be never &s;o highly titled or charactered, let their Preten&s;ions to Learning be what they will, and their Acquaintance with Creeds, Canons and Commenta|tors never &s;o exten&s;ive, yet &s;o long as they continue Men of this World, and follow the Things of it, &s;o long as their Affections are &s;et on Things beneath, and their Hearts un|&s;urrendered to God, they are no better than dry Bones as to the divine Life, without Marrow or Moi&s;ture; and as they cannot in &s;uch a State receive the Things of the Spirit of God, not having &s;piritual Sen&s;es exerci&s;ed thereto, &s;o will the&s;e Things of Cour&s;e appear Fooli&s;hne&s;s unto them in Others, and they will &s;peak Evil of that which they know not. A Party Spirit, &s;ays the &s;ame Author, whether it be in Religion or Politics, proceeds from Littlene&s;s of Mind and Narrowne&s;s of Heart, it puts out both the Eye of

the Judgment and the Eye of Charity, and &s;o hinders us from &s;eeing the brighte&s;t Excellence in our Neighbour that is not ju&s;t as high or low as our &s;elves, as I heared a Man of Learning once &s;ay, that he could not allow <HI>Milton's Pa|radi&s;e lo&s;t</HI> to be a good Book, becau&s;e written by an Olive|rian. But the Chri&s;tian knows no &s;uch Straitne&s;s; for his Bowels are enlarged towards All that will come within the Embraces of his Charity, which is as wide as the Ea&s;t is from the We&s;t. He cannot wrangle and hate about Diffe|rences of Opinion, for he is got above them; his Call, his univer&s;al Call is Love, and he has adopted for his Motto that Saying of <HI>Luther: In whom&s;oever I &s;ee any Thing of Chri&s;t, him I love.</HI> In this Man, where&s;oever he lives, and by what Name &s;oever he is called, the Kingdom of Chri&s;t is come; and of &s;uch heavenly Men and Women it will con&s;i&s;t in that enlarged glorious State of it which we are given to look for: And what, if it be already begun on Earth!</P>
<P><Q>The one true Church of Chri&s;t is the Communion of Saints, and Charity; true Charity, i. e. the Love of Chri&s;t is the Life and Soul of it: Is then the Love of God &s;hed abroad in our Hearts, and have we fervent Charity among Our&s;elves? For, be it known of a Truth, that as much as we po&s;&s;e&s;s of this heavenly Trea|&s;ure, &s;o much have we of Chri&s;tianity, and no more; and that without it, all Zeal for Religion is but Conten|tion, all Modes of Wor&s;hip but Formality, and all Or|thodoxy but vain Opinion.</Q></P>
