<P>_WE are pre&s;ented, in the foregoing ver&s;es, with an <HI>ab&s;tract</HI> of an excellent Sermon&punc; preacht by the apo&s;tle <HI>Peter</HI>; as al&s;o an account of that <HI>Divine power</HI> which came on the <HI>hearers,</HI> even while he was preaching it. v. 44. <HI>while Peter yet &s;pake the&s;e words, the</HI> HOLY GHOST <HI>fell on all that heard the Word.</HI> 'Tis ob&s;ervable, the HOLY GHOST fell univer&s;ally upon the <HI>auditory.</HI> There was not a per&s;on pre&s;ent, neither <HI>Jew</HI> nor <HI>Gentile, man</HI> nor <HI>wo|man, old</HI> nor <HI>young,</HI> but he was a partaker of the HOLY GHOST. He <HI>fell on all that heard the Word.</HI> The following ver&s;e exhibits an account of the <HI>a&s;toni&s;hment,</HI> the believing <HI>Jews</HI> were filled with at this event. <HI>And they of the circumci&s;ion, which believed, were a&s;toni&s;hed.</HI> And the more <HI>&s;pecial rea&s;on</HI> of their a&s;toni&s;hment is given in the next words; which was not, as we may be ready to imagine, &s;o much the <HI>de&s;cent</HI> of the HOLY GHOST, as the <HI>per&s;on on whom he felt.</HI> The <HI>former</HI>

they had often been witne&s;&s;es to before, it was an event common in that day; the <HI>latter</HI> was new and &s;trange, what they did not expect, and were much &s;urpri&s;ed at. They were <HI>a&s;toni&s;hed,</HI> becau&s;e, &s;ays my text, <HI>on the Gen|tiles al&s;o was poured out the gift of the</HI> HOLY GHOST: In which words the three following things are ob&s;erva|ble,</P>
<P N="1">I. The <HI>gift</HI> here &s;poken of; viz. the HOLY GHOST.</P>
<P N="2">II. The <HI>per&s;on to whom</HI> he was given; and the&s;e were the <HI>Gentiles al&s;o,</HI> i. e. the <HI>Gentiles</HI> as well as <HI>Jews</HI>; both in <HI>common; one</HI> as well as the <HI>other,</HI> without <HI>re|&s;pect of per&s;ons.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. The <HI>manner</HI> of be&s;towing this gift; It was <HI>poured out.</HI></P>
<P>Accordingly, the&s;e are the particulars we &s;hall briefly con&s;ider, and then apply to the <HI>occa&s;ions</HI> of the day.</P>
<P N="1">I. The fir&s;t thing ob&s;ervable in the text is, the <HI>gift</HI> &s;poken of; viz. the HOLY GHOST.</P>
<P>The HOLY GHOST, or HOLY SPIRIT, as the word is el&s;ewhere tran&s;lated; &mdash; It's the name of the THIRD of the SACRED THREE. He is otherwi&s;e &s;til'd &s;ometimes, by way of empha&s;is, THE SPIRIT; &s;ometimes, the SPIRIT of GOD, the SPIRIT of CHRIST, the SPIRIT of <HI>grace,</HI> the SPIRIT of <HI>truth,</HI> the SPIRIT of <HI>holine&s;s</HI>; &s;ometimes, he is &s;poken of as the COMFORTER, the SANCTIFIER, and the like. That glorious per&s;on is pointed out, under all the&s;e ap|pellations, in who&s;e <HI>name,</HI> as well as in the <HI>name</HI> of the FATHER and the SON, we are <HI>bapti&s;ed,</HI> and by this <HI>in&s;tituted rite</HI> take upon us the character of <HI>Chri&s;tians.</HI></P>
<P>Only, let it be remembred, where the HOLY GHOST is &s;poken of as a <HI>gift</HI> from GOD, we are not to under&s;tand hereby the <HI>per&s;on,</HI> but the <HI>influences</HI> of this <HI>ble&s;&s;ed</HI> SPIRIT. Not that the HOLY GHOST is nothing more than an <HI>emanation, operation</HI> or <HI>influence,</HI> from the FATHER. He is often repre&s;ented, in the
<PB N="7" REF="004914_0005_100E2B5719855340">
<HI>bible,</HI> as an <HI>agent,</HI> a <HI>per&s;on,</HI> as truly and properly &s;o, as either the FATHER or the SON. But tho' he be a real, living, active, infinitely glorious <HI>per&s;on,</HI> yet when he is &s;poken of as a <HI>gift,</HI> we are to under&s;tand hereby his <HI>influences</HI> and <HI>operations.</HI></P>
<P>And the&s;e are either <HI>extraordinary</HI> or <HI>ordinary.</HI></P>
<P>In the beginning of Chri&s;tianity, the HOLY GHOST was given to men, in an <HI>extraordinary</HI> manner, i. e. in <HI>miraculous</HI> gifts and powers. It does not appear, that the HOLY GHOST, in this &s;en&s;e, was confin'd to the <HI>apo&s;tles,</HI> or their <HI>fellow labourers</HI> in the work of the Lord. The <HI>apo&s;tles,</HI> 'tis true, were the fir&s;t, after our SAVIOUR<HI>'s a&s;cention</HI> up to <HI>heaven,</HI> to whom the HOLY GHOST was thus given. It was upon <HI>them</HI> that he <HI>de|&s;cended, on the day of Penteco&s;t, in cloven tongues like as of fire,</HI> to their being enabled to &s;peak in <HI>various lan|guages</HI>; yea, and to <HI>&s;hew &s;igns and wonders,</HI> and to <HI>work miracles,</HI> to the <HI>a&s;toni&s;hment</HI> and <HI>conver&s;ion</HI> of mul|titudes. But it &s;hould &s;eem, as if the <HI>gift of the</HI> HOLY GHOST, in this <HI>extraordinary</HI> manner, was not the <HI>&s;ole</HI> priviledge of the <HI>apo&s;tles,</HI> or <HI>fir&s;t mini&s;ters</HI> of the Chri|&s;tian religion. It rather appears to have been a <HI>gift</HI> be&s;towed upon Chri&s;tians in <HI>common.</HI> Some of the per&s;ons, cho&s;en from among the <HI>people</HI> to be <HI>Deacons,</HI> were thus <HI>miraculou&s;ly</HI> endowed. 'Tis particularly re|corded of <HI>Stephen</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts 6.8.</NOTE>, <HI>that he did great wonders and mira|cles among the people.</HI> And in the Church at <HI>Corinth,</HI> there was a great diver&s;ity of the&s;e <HI>extraordinary</HI> gifts; and they &s;eem to have been <HI>common</HI> among the <HI>people. To one was given, by the</HI> SPIRIT, <HI>the word of wi&s;dom; to another, the word of knowledge by the &s;ame</HI> SPIRIT; <HI>to another, faith; to another, the gift of healing; to ano|ther, the working of miracles; to another, prophecy; to another, di&s;cerning of Spirits; to another, diver&s;e kinds of tongues; to another, the interpretation of tongues.</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="004914_0006_100E2B5B43D87F40">
And, perhaps, there were few, in the fir&s;t days of the go&s;pel, but were endowed with &s;ome <HI>extraordinary</HI> gift of the SPIRIT or another.</P>
<P>And it was at <HI>different</HI> &s;ea&s;ons that the HOLY GHOST fell upon per&s;ons, in his <HI>miraculous</HI> powers. Sometimes, he came upon them, even before they were <HI>bapti&s;ed.</HI> So it was in my context. Upon <HI>Peter</HI>'s <HI>preaching</HI> to the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> the HOLY GHOST <HI>fell upon them all.</HI> And that he fell upon them in his <HI>extraordi|nary</HI> gifts, is evident from what follows: for 'tis ob|&s;erved, <HI>they were heard to &s;peak with tongues.</HI> i. e. with <HI>&s;trange</HI> tongues, in languages they did not before under|&s;tand, nor could &s;peak. But <HI>more commonly</HI> the HOLY GHOST was given by the <HI>laying on of the hands of the apo&s;tles after bapti&s;m.</HI> An in&s;tance of this we have, in Act. 19.5, 6. where, after a number of di&s;ciples had been <HI>bapti&s;ed,</HI> 'tis &s;aid, <HI>Paul laid his hands upon them, and the</HI> HOLY GHOST <HI>came on them:</HI> And he <HI>&s;o</HI> came on them, as that <HI>they &s;pake with tongues, and prophe&s;ied.</HI> And it was the <HI>falling of the</HI> HOLY GHOST on per|&s;ons, in his <HI>miraculous</HI> powers, <HI>by the laying on of the hands of the apo&s;tles,</HI> that put <HI>Simon Magus</HI> upon making an offer to purcha&s;e this <HI>wonderful gift with money</HI>*.</P>
<P>Some, perhaps, may be ready to envy the&s;e <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Chri&s;tians their priviledge, in being thus <HI>miraculou&s;ly</HI> endowed; imagining, they were much better of it than <HI>we,</HI> who can pretend to no &s;uch <HI>extraordinary</HI> gifts. But what &s;ays the in&s;pired <HI>Paul?</HI> Why, &s;peaking to the Chri&s;tians at <HI>Corinth,</HI> concerning <HI>the&s;e very extraor|dinary gifts of the</HI> HOLY GHOST, he directs them to what was far more de&s;irable. <HI>I &s;hew unto you,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>a more excellent way</HI>&dagger;. And <HI>this way</HI> he <HI>&s;hewed</HI> to them, was that of <HI>Charity</HI> or <HI>love.</HI> The true <HI>love</HI> of <HI>our neighbour,</HI> &s;pringing from <HI>love</HI> to GOD, and a prin|ciple of <HI>faith</HI> in JESUS CHRIST, is a <HI>gift</HI> far <HI>preferable</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="004914_0007_100E2B5E84899348">
to any of the <HI>miraculous</HI> gifts, the fir&s;t Chri&s;tians were endowed with: And upon whom&s;oever GOD be&s;tows this gift, he does more for them, than if he enabled them to <HI>&s;peak with the tongues of men or angels,</HI> or gave them <HI>faith</HI> &s;o that they could <HI>remove mountains.</HI> This, 'tis true, might make them more eminent in their <HI>own</HI> as well as in the e&s;teem of <HI>others</HI>; but the <HI>former</HI> would render them <HI>better</HI> in them&s;elves, and far more <HI>acceptable</HI> in the &s;ight of GOD.</P>
<P>'Tis worth our particular remark, the <HI>extraordinary gifts</HI> of the HOLY GHOST made no man the <HI>better Chri&s;tian.</HI> They did not <HI>&s;anctify</HI> his &s;oul, or put him in a &s;tate of favour with GOD: And if <HI>&s;anctified</HI> per|&s;ons were tho&s;e, on whom they, were <HI>often</HI> conferred, yet this was not <HI>always</HI> the ca&s;e. It was no certain argument of a man's being a good man, a &s;incere &s;er|vant of JESUS CHRIST, that the HOLY GHOST <HI>had come upon him in his extraordinary gifts.</HI> The <HI>Spirit of prophecy</HI> fell on <HI>Balaam,</HI> who made <HI>I&s;rael to &s;in,</HI> and of whom it is te&s;tified by an apo&s;tle, that he <HI>loved the wages of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> And <HI>Judas,</HI> as well as the other <HI>apo&s;tles,</HI> had the power of <HI>working &s;igns and won|ders,</HI> and of <HI>ca&s;ting out Devils:</HI> Yea, our SAVIOUR him&s;elf has declar'd, that <HI>he will,</HI> in the great day of judgment, <HI>&s;ay unto many who have prophe&s;ied in his name, and in his name ca&s;t out Devils, and in his name done many wonderful works, I never knew you: Depart from me, ye that work inequity</HI>*. The&s;e <HI>miraculous</HI> gifts were rather be&s;towed for the good of <HI>others,</HI> than the <HI>per&s;ons them&s;elves</HI> who had them. <HI>Tongues,</HI> &s;ays the apo&s;tle&dagger;, <HI>are for a &s;ign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not.</HI> They were intended as an <HI>open atte&s;tation</HI> to the truth of the <HI>Chri&s;tian religion</HI>; which being now &s;ettled in the world, there is no further u&s;e of them.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="004914_0008_100E2B61B168C5F0">I therefore go on to ob&s;erve,</P>
<P>By the <HI>gift of the</HI> HOLY GHOST, we are to under|&s;tand, not only the&s;e <HI>extraordinary powers,</HI> but that <HI>ordinary influence,</HI> common to all ages of the Church, whereby the <HI>work of Divine grace</HI> is <HI>begun</HI> and <HI>carried on</HI> in the &s;ouls of men, to there being prepared in this world for the ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of the world that is to come.</P>
<P>Some, I am &s;en&s;ible, are for confining the <HI>gift of the</HI> HOLY GHOST to the <HI>apo&s;tolic age:</HI> But there is no rea&s;on for this. 'Tis plain from the current &s;train of the whole new-te&s;tament, that the <HI>gift</HI> of the HOLY GHOST is as nece&s;&s;ary for per&s;ons in all <HI>after</HI> ages, as it was in the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> days of the Go&s;pel. 'Tis therefore declared in language extending to all <HI>times</HI> as well as <HI>Per&s;ons</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John 3.5.</NOTE>, <HI>except a man be born of the</HI> SPIRIT, <HI>he can|not enter into the kingdom of GOD</HI>; and again, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. 8.9.</NOTE> <HI>If any man have not the</HI> SPIRIT <HI>of</HI> CHRIST, <HI>he is none of his</HI>; and yet again, <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">1 John 4.13.</NOTE> <HI>Hereby we know that we dwell in him, and he in us, becau&s;e he hath given us of his</HI> SPIRIT.</P>
<P>Nor by the <HI>gift of the</HI> SPIRIT, in this Sen&s;e, are we to under&s;tand barely the <HI>objective</HI> influence of re|vealed truths, or any improvements of nature that are meerly <HI>moral</HI>; but that immediate pre&s;ence and influ|ence of the HOLY GHOST, whereby a real power is communicated to the purpo&s;es of religion. This is the true meaning of tho&s;e numerous texts, wherein tho&s;e who are real Chri&s;tians, are &s;aid <HI>to be born of the</HI> SPI|RIT; to have the SPIRIT <HI>dwelling in their Hearts by faith</HI>; to be <HI>&s;trengthened with all might in the inner man by the</HI> SPIRIT; to be <HI>led by the</HI> SPIRIT; <HI>to walk in the</HI> SPIRIT, and the like. By the&s;e phra&s;es, is pointed out a &s;ort of influence beyond what is meerly <HI>natural</HI> or <HI>moral:</HI> 'Tis evidently their main &s;cope to repre&s;ent the holy SPIRIT as <HI>all in all</HI> in the bu&s;ine&s;s
<PB N="11" REF="004914_0009_100E2B65B09005A8">
of pure and undefiled religion; the beginner, the car|rier on, and the fini&s;her of faith, yea, and of every thing el&s;e that is &s;piritually good, in the hearts of &s;in|cere Chri&s;tians: Nor will any thing &s;hort of this come up to the ju&s;t and full import of the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>Nor is it any objection again&s;t the&s;e <HI>operations</HI> of the HOLY GHOST, that we know not <HI>how</HI> he operates upon the humane mind. Men may, if they plea&s;e, take occa&s;ion from hence to &s;peak contemptuou&s;ly of this di&s;pen&s;ation of GOD's Grace; but 'tis, in true rea|&s;on, no argument again&s;t the <HI>reality</HI> of a thing, that the <HI>manner</HI> of it can't be de&s;cribed. Who can tell how his own Spirit operates on his own body, or his own body on his own Spirit? And yet, there is nothing we are more &s;ure of, than that they mutually operate on each other. And if it be no objection again&s;t the mutual operation of &s;oul and body upon one another, that we know not the <HI>modus</HI> of their operation, nei|ther is our ignorance as to the <HI>manner</HI> of the SPIRIT's operation on the hearts of Men, any objection again&s;t the thing it &s;elf: Nor is it at all incredible, that the GOD who made our &s;ouls, and is perfectly acquainted with all their &s;prings of action, &s;hould be able to ope|rate upon them; and this, in a way &s;uited to their nature, and &s;o as not to break in, in the lea&s;t, upon the ju&s;t exerci&s;e of their <HI>rea&s;onable</HI> powers. It would argue but a low conception of the infinitely wi&s;e GOD to &s;uppo&s;e the contrary. He that has an immediate acce&s;s to our Spirits <HI>can</HI> certainly work upon them, and, in a <HI>rea&s;onable</HI> way, influence them both <HI>to will and to do of his own good plea&s;ure:</HI> And that the Di|vine ever-ble&s;&s;ed SPIRIT does really thus operate upon them, and in thus doing acts the part e&s;pecially a&s;&s;igned him to the affair of man's &s;alvation, mu&s;t be acknowledged to be the obvious &s;en&s;e of a great num|ber of texts, which can't, without the greate&s;t violence, bet interpreted to any other meaning. But it will not
<PB N="12" REF="004914_0010_100E2B68291F7358">
be ami&s;s, if we are a little particular in explaining the <HI>gift of the</HI> HOLY GHOST, as it means this <HI>internal operation</HI> of his, which is common to all ages of the Church. And it con&s;i&s;ts in the following things,</P>
<P N="1">1. In <HI>convincing men of Sin.</HI> This is the fir&s;t ope|ration of the SPIRIT upon the Sinner. Accordingly, this is particularly mentioned as one of the ends for which the SPIRIT is &s;aid to be given to men, even that he might <HI>reprove,</HI> or convince, <HI>them of &s;in</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John 16.8.</NOTE>. And this he does by awakening their attention, bringing them to con&s;ideration, and giving them &s;uch a &s;ight of <HI>&s;in</HI> as they never had before. When the SPIRIT con|vinces of &s;in, he opens the &s;inners eyes, &s;o that he &s;ees it to be an evil and bitter thing, that he has for|&s;aken the LORD his GOD. He has now an appre|hen&s;ion of &s;in as what is hateful to the Divine maje&s;ty, and dreadful in its effects and con&s;equences; He has now a view of him&s;elf as an object of wrath, and heir of hell, and in danger every moment of being made mi&s;erable in that future place of torment: And from this apprehen&s;ion of &s;in, and of his own immanent ha|zard as under the guilt of it, he is filled with unea&s;i|ne&s;s; bitterly reflects upon him&s;elf, and feels all that inward di&s;tre&s;s which is the re&s;ult of a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of guilt, an actual clear view of him&s;elf as in a &s;tate, wherein he de&s;erves to be &s;ent away to be made un|happy in the place of blackne&s;s of darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>Some, perhaps, may think, there is no need of this perception of &s;in, and unea&s;ine&s;s from a &s;en&s;e of guilt; but 'tis <HI>ordinarily</HI> nece&s;&s;ary, as that without which there can be no &s;uch thing as a real and thorow <HI>conver&s;ion</HI> to GOD: To be &s;ure, 'tis a matter of nece&s;&s;ity in re|&s;pect of <HI>adult</HI> per&s;ons, tho&s;e among them particularly, who in&s;tead of being re&s;trained from &s;in from their
<PB N="13" REF="004914_0011_100E2B6BA5F10B10">
early Childhood, have given the reins to their lu&s;ts, and gone on adding iniquity to tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. 'Tis &s;eldom, if ever, that a &s;aving change is effected in &s;uch, but 'tis preceeded with bitter reflections on their pa&s;t &s;ecurity and folly, and unea&s;y &s;en&s;ations from an apprehen&s;ion of them&s;elves as obnoxious to the Divine vengeance.</P>
<P>Tho' it ought to be particularly remembred here, that the degrees of di&s;tre&s;s, from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;in and fear of wrath, are va&s;tly various in different per|&s;ons. In &s;ome 'tis greater, in others &s;maller; in &s;ome 'tis of longer, in others of &s;horter continuance; in all, that are &s;avingly brought home to GOD in JESUS CHRIST, the concern of &s;oul is &s;ufficient to put them effectually upon the u&s;e of appointed means in order to their obtaining mercy; but in none, is this di&s;tre&s;s excited to &s;o great a degree as to put them be&s;ide them&s;elves, unle&s;s from their own weakne&s;s, or igno|rance, or &s;ome faulty cau&s;e or other, which ought not to be a&s;cribed to the SPIRIT of GOD.</P>
<P>And it may be worth remembring likewi&s;e, that this <HI>conviction</HI> of &s;in is a thing quite different from <HI>con|ver&s;ion.</HI> 'Tis only the <HI>fir&s;t &s;tep</HI> towards it, a prepa|ration of mind making way for it: Nor unle&s;s it end in this ble&s;&s;ed change, will it &s;ignify any thing, if per|&s;ons are under ever &s;o deep di&s;tre&s;s. This &s;hould be well con&s;idered by &s;uch as may be under convictions. You may not from hence conclude your &s;elves to be in a good &s;tate. The &s;ight you have of &s;in as an evil thing, the apprehen&s;ion you have of your &s;elves as ob|jects of wrath, and the unea&s;ine&s;s you may be under herefrom, are nothing more than the <HI>tendencies</HI> towards <HI>conver&s;ion.</HI> And let me tell you, there may be the <HI>former</HI> and not the <HI>latter.</HI> You may turn out &s;hameful apo&s;tates from GOD after very &s;erious impre&s;&s;ions, very &s;trong convictions, yea, and great zeal in an at|tendance on religious duties. O take heed, you don't

<P N="3">3. Another operation, included in the <HI>gift of the</HI> HOLY GHOST, is the <HI>change</HI> whereby men are made <HI>new creatures.</HI> We every where read, in the in&s;pir'd writings, of a <HI>Change,</HI> which 'tis nece&s;&s;ary Sinners &s;hould pa&s;s under, as ever they would hope, according to the tenour of the Go&s;pel covenant, to be admitted into the coming kingdom of GOD. This <HI>change</HI> is &s;poken of under a variety of names. 'Tis &s;ometimes called <HI>conver&s;ion,</HI> &s;ometimes <HI>regeneration,</HI> &s;ometimes 'tis compar'd to a <HI>re&s;urrection,</HI> and &s;ometimes to a <HI>new creation.</HI> The &s;ame thing is intended in all the&s;e phra&s;es; even that change which is made in men, when they become true Chri&s;tians. Not that there is any change effected in them, <HI>phy&s;ically</HI> &s;peaking; their natural powers and faculties are &s;till the &s;ame: But in the <HI>religious</HI> and <HI>moral</HI> &s;en&s;e, they are &s;trangely altered. There is a change wrought both in their
<PB N="17" REF="004914_0015_100E2B786EB5FE18">
hearts and lives, in all their inward principles as well as outward behaviour in the world. They are, as it were, new moulded and fa&s;hioned. They have other thoughts and &s;entiments, other &s;prings of action, other views and aims; they are &s;o altered as to be quite other per&s;ons, they have another temper of mind, ano|ther ta&s;te and reli&s;h, another heart and &s;oul, and they lead another kind of life, are pious towards GOD, righ|teous towards men, and &s;ober in re&s;pect of them&s;elves.</P>
<P>This is the change we mu&s;t pa&s;s under, in order to our being made meet for the inheritance of the &s;aints in light. And 'tis to effect this change, that the HOLY GHOST <HI>is given</HI>: Nor can it be effected in any way but by his <HI>operations</HI> in us. It is not the produce of <HI>meer rea&s;on,</HI> nor of <HI>external revelation.</HI> It is not bro't about by the bare influence of <HI>moral motives,</HI> whether they are fetch'd from the <HI>law</HI> or the <HI>Go&s;pel:</HI> No, but it is an <HI>effect</HI> of the <HI>power</HI> of <HI>the</HI> SPIRIT, working effectually in them that believe. And 'tis every where in the bible &s;poken of as &s;uch. This is the ju&s;t import of the <HI>metaphors,</HI> under which this change is figur'd out to us. That of a <HI>new creation</HI> points our view di|rectly to GOD as the author of conver&s;ion. If this were an ea&s;y bu&s;ine&s;s, a matter within the reach of men's own power, what they could accompli&s;h by an act of their <HI>own free will,</HI> it would never have been &s;et forth under this &s;imilitude. To <HI>create</HI> is the known prerogative of GOD: And the fir&s;t thing mo&s;t obvi|ou&s;ly occurring to our minds from this re&s;emblance is, that the <HI>new creature</HI> is the <HI>workman&s;hip of</HI> GOD. The &s;ame thought is &s;ugge&s;ted from the metaphor of a <HI>re|&s;urrection,</HI> under which this change is &s;ometimes &s;poken of. <HI>Rai&s;ing the dead</HI> be&s;peaks the agency of GOD. 'Tis therefore natural, and almo&s;t unavoidable, when we read of conver&s;ion under this figure, to conclude it to be a work beyond the power of man, and as requiring a <HI>Divine power</HI> to effect it.</P>

<P>But &s;ome, perhaps, may be &s;o curious as to a&s;k, how does the HOLY GHOST produce this change in men?</P>
<P>And to &s;uch the an&s;wer is, this is one of tho&s;e things, concerning which we know but very little: Nor ought our ignorance, as to the <HI>manner</HI> of this pro|duction, to be e&s;teemed the lea&s;t objection again&s;t the truth of the thing. We know not the <HI>manner</HI> in the <HI>natural</HI>; and why &s;hould it be thought &s;trange if we know not the <HI>manner</HI> in the <HI>&s;piritual</HI> creation? The methods of operation, in the <HI>Kingdom of grace,</HI> and in the <HI>Kingdom of nature,</HI> are both alike &s;ecret and my&s;te|rious: And we have no more rea&s;on therefore to ob|ject again&s;t the <HI>former</HI> than the <HI>latter.</HI> 'Tis no argu|ment again&s;t the formation of children, that <HI>we know not how the bones grow in the womb of her that is with child</HI>; neither is it of any validity again&s;t the formation of the <HI>new man,</HI> that we know not preci&s;ely the <HI>way</HI> and <HI>manner</HI> in which the <HI>Divine</HI> SPIRIT exerts him&s;elf

in the production of this <HI>&s;piritual workman&s;hip:</HI> They are both fearful and wonderful.</P>
<P>Thus much indeed we know in general, that in <HI>new making</HI> men, the <HI>Divine</HI> SPIRIT acts in, and upon them, in a way &s;uited to their nature <HI>as Men,</HI> in a way that agrees with their character as <HI>moral agents.</HI> He &s;o manages the matter, as that they are changed into <HI>new men,</HI> in a method perfectly harmonizing with their &s;everal powers, &s;o as that they oppo&s;e not one another, but are pre&s;erved in due dependance and &s;ubordination to each other. <HI>Light</HI> is commanded to &s;hine into the <HI>under&s;tanding,</HI> the enlighten'd <HI>under&s;tanding</HI> directs and governs the <HI>will,</HI> and the <HI>will</HI> the &s;everal <HI>affections</HI> of the <HI>&s;oul</HI> and <HI>powers</HI> of the <HI>body</HI>: But to &s;ay <HI>preci&s;ely</HI> how the HOLY GHOST enlightens the <HI>mind,</HI> and then captivates the <HI>will,</HI> and then pre&s;erves the <HI>affections</HI> and <HI>pa&s;&s;ions</HI> in due harmony, and conducts the <HI>life</HI> in the way of holine&s;s; the&s;e things, I &s;ay, are difficulties in this di&s;pen&s;ation of grace: And as they are &s;uch, the le&s;s we puzzle our &s;elves or others about them, the bet|ter. The thing is certain, Men are &s;ometimes <HI>new made</HI>; and when they are &s;o, 'tis as evident from the Scripture, that 'tis GOD by his SPIRIT, that <HI>new makes</HI> them. Let us &s;ee to it, that we be in the num|ber of tho&s;e who are <HI>new creatures,</HI> and as to the <HI>way</HI> and <HI>manner</HI> in which it plea&s;es GOD to bring this about, we need not be at all concerned about it.

Another thing, included in this <HI>gift of the</HI> HOLY GHOST, is his <HI>exciting &s;incere Chri&s;tians</HI> to, and <HI>a&s;&s;i&s;t|ing</HI> them in, the practice of their duty, to their <HI>increa|&s;ing in grace,</HI> and <HI>per&s;evering therein unto the end.</HI> There is need of the HOLY GHOST not only to turn men from the power of &s;in and Satan unto GOD, but, when they are thus changed, to &s;tir them up to acti|vity in the work of GOD and their Soul's &s;alvation, and
<PB N="20" REF="004914_0018_100E2B855C70CAD0">
to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in it. If left to them&s;elves, the be&s;t Chri&s;tians, tho&s;e that are fulle&s;t of faith and holine&s;s, and every other grace, would &s;oon lo&s;e their vigour&punc; nor without the continual aids of the <HI>Divine</HI> SPIRIT would they be able to honour CHRIST, and adorn their profe&s;&s;ion by a conver&s;ation becoming the Go&s;pel. The HOLY GHOST therefore is given to them, to ex|cite good motions in them, to animate their re&s;olutions, to quicken their graces and a&s;&s;i&s;t them in the exerci&s;e of them, to their running the way of GOD's command|ments with &s;trength and vigour, with chearfulne&s;s and delight. This is certainly the language of Scripture upon this head. Hence that prayer of holy <HI>David,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm 1<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">9.25.</NOTE> <HI>Quicken me according to thy word!</HI> and again, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">ver. 35</NOTE> <HI>Quicken thou me in thy way!</HI> And hence al&s;o tho&s;e pious ac|knowledgments of his, <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">ver. 50.</NOTE> <HI>Thy word,</HI> i. e. as enliven'd by thy SPIRIT, <HI>hath quickened me.</HI> And again, <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">ver. 93.</NOTE> <HI>I will never forget thy precepts; for with them thou ha&s;t quickened me.</HI> And the HOLY GHOST is &s;aid to <HI>dwell in the hearts</HI> of good Chri&s;tians; and they are repre|&s;ented as <HI>led by the</HI> SPIRIT, and as <HI>walking in the</HI> SPIRIT. The plain meaning of all which texts is, at lea&s;t thus much, that the HOLY GHOST is given to good men to be their excitement in duty, their conti|nual help in the practice of it.</P>
<P>And 'tis owing to the &s;ame pre&s;ence and influence of the HOLY GHOST, that they are enabled to grow in grace, and in a conformity to the image and exam|ple of their Saviour; to be more weaned from this world, and prepared for a better.</P>
<P>In one word, 'tis owing to the &s;ame influence &s;till, that they are kept from falling, and pre&s;erved through faith unto &s;alvation. And indeed, &s;uch are their in|di&s;po&s;itions within, and &s;uch their temptations without; &s;uch is the &s;ubtilty of Satan, &s;uch the &s;nares

of the world, and &s;uch their own weakne&s;s, that it could not be expected, but they &s;hould draw back to perdition, were they not under the &s;pecial and continual guidance of the HOLY GHOST: And to this it is always attributed in Scripture, that they are pre&s;erved unto CHRIST's heavenly kingdom.

The holy apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> is very expre&s;s in taking notice of this in&s;tance of the SPIRIT's operation. Hence he applies to tho&s;e, who are <HI>led by the</HI> SPIRIT, and are <HI>the Sons of</HI> GOD, in that language,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. 8.15.</NOTE> <HI>But ye have received the</HI> SPIRIT <HI>of adoption, whereby ye cry, Abba, father.</HI> Parallel whereto are tho&s;e words of his, in his <HI>Epi&s;tle</HI> to the <HI>Galatians</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chap. 4. ver. 6.</NOTE>, <HI>And becau&s;e ye are Sons,</HI> GOD <HI>hath &s;ent forth the</HI> SPIRIT <HI>of his</HI> SON, <HI>into your hearts, crying, Abba, father.</HI> But the mo&s;t ob&s;ervable text to this purpo&s;e, is that in Rom. 8.16, 17. <HI>The</HI> SPIRIT <HI>it &s;elf beareth witne&s;s with our Spi|rits, that we are the children of GOD: And if children, then Heirs, heirs of GOD, and joint-heirs with</HI> CHRIST.</P>
<P>Some, perhaps, from this text, may expect an im|mediate whi&s;per from the SPIRIT, or &s;ome &s;ecret ex|traordinary impul&s;e, a&s;&s;uring them, they are the chil|dren of GOD. And I deny not but the HOLY GHOST can, if he plea&s;es, in this way, make it evident to a man, that he is an heir to the inheritance of the Saints in light: But this does not appear to be the way of the SPIRIT<HI>'s witne&s;&s;ing</HI>; and it may be dangerous for per&s;ons to ground their hopes of heaven upon meer impul&s;es and impre&s;&s;ions: E&s;pecially, will this be dan|gerous, if they &s;et up the&s;e things in the room of the written word, or depend upon them in oppo&s;ition to it. Multitudes have by degrees come to this, and dreadful have been the delu&s;ions they have been betrayed into. They have even mi&s;took, not only the workings of their own imaginations, but the &s;ugge&s;tions of Satan, for undoubted dictates of the HOLY GHOST.</P>
<P>This <HI>witne&s;s of the</HI> SPIRIT is always agreable to the Scripture, and lies principally in two things. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI>

in producing in us the di&s;po&s;ition of GOD's children, which is done in the work of regeneration, whereby we are form'd to a Divine likene&s;s, and made, as it were, living images of our FATHER in heaven. And then, <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> in helping us to &s;ee in our &s;elves this filial frame and temper of Soul, and &s;o to &s;ee it as from hence to be clearly per&s;uaded of our intere&s;t in the rights of the Sons of GOD.

<P>Let me add here, and I may do it with the greate&s;t boldne&s;s, that where there is not a <HI>work of grace</HI> in the heart, it can never be witne&s;&s;ed to a man, that he is a child of GOD; for he is not: And by whatever impul&s;es, impre&s;&s;ions, or revelations, he is made to be|lieve that he is, he is certainly under the influence of a heated imagination, or a &s;pirit of delu&s;ion. The Divine SPIRIT, as Mr. HENRY ob&s;erves, "wit|ne&s;&s;es to none, the priviledges of children, that have not the nature and di&s;po&s;ition of children"; No, but he "te&s;tifies our adoption, as Mr. BURKITT<HI>'s</HI> words are, by evidencing to us our &s;anctification And all this, as he adds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">BURKITT in loc.</NOTE>, is done, not by &s;udden impul&s;es, and immediate in&s;pirations, which is the <HI>witne&s;&s;ing</HI> of the SPIRIT, <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;ts</HI> pretend to, but the SPIRIT <HI>wit|ne&s;&s;es</HI> in a way of argumentation. Thus, whoever re|pents, believes and obeys the Go&s;pel, &s;ays the Scrip|ture, &s;hall be &s;aved; but the SPIRIT helps us to &s;ee that we do &s;o, and accordingly enables us to infer and conclude that we &s;hall be &s;aved."&mdash; But I am &s;en&s;i|ble I have been too long in explaining to you, what we are to under&s;tand by the <HI>gift of the</HI> HOLY GHOST.

The <HI>apo&s;tles</HI> them&s;elves; and this, even after the death and re&s;urrection of CHRIST, were too much under the influence of this <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Spi|rit.

<P N="1">1. Let us take occa&s;ion, from what has been offer'd, to <HI>examine</HI> each one of us, whether the <HI>gift of the</HI> HOLY GHOST has been poured out upon us. This is a matter it very nearly concerns us all to enquire into. For <HI>if any man have not the</HI> SPIRIT <HI>of</HI> CHRIST, <HI>he is none of his.</HI> He is no di&s;ciple of CHRIST; he has no intere&s;t in the favour of GOD, nor in the merits of the SAVIOUR; he is yet in his &s;ins, a child of wrath, and an heir to Hell. Can you then be too &s;ollicitous to know, whether you have <HI>this gift,</HI> which is a matter of &s;uch everla&s;ting importance? You may come to a comfortable &s;atisfaction as to this from what has been di&s;cours'd.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="004914_0032_100E2BB91FB222C0">You will ea&s;ily collect thence, wherein this gift does not con&s;i&s;t; that it does not lie in <HI>vi&s;ions,</HI> and <HI>revelati|ons,</HI> and <HI>Trances.</HI> None of the&s;e things are mentioned any where in the bible, as &s;uch evidences of the SPI|RIT in us, as will argue our belonging to CHRIST JESUS: Nay, even in the days of the Apo&s;tles, they were no proof of a real good character. Per&s;ons, in tho&s;e times, might <HI>&s;ee vi&s;ions,</HI> and <HI>&s;hew &s;igns</HI>; yea, and <HI>ca&s;t out Devils, and do many wonderful works,</HI> and after all be doom'd to a <HI>departure from</HI> CHRIST, <HI>to dwell with devouring fire.</HI> The <HI>gift of the</HI> HOLY GHOST, in a &s;en&s;e that will denominate you the <HI>children of</HI> GOD, and <HI>Heirs to heaven</HI> lies not in things of this nature; but in tho&s;e <HI>internal operations</HI> that are common to all <HI>good Chri&s;tians,</HI> and have been &s;o in <HI>all ages,</HI> and in <HI>all places,</HI> from the days of CHRIST.</P>
<P>Would you know, my brethren, whether the HOLY GHOST has been <HI>poured out</HI> upon you, &s;o as that you may conclude your &s;elves to be intere&s;ted in CHRIST, and in &s;uch a &s;tate as that you may expect the &s;alva|tion of your Souls, you may, by the help of grace, come to a good hope of this, by a&s;king your &s;elves &s;uch que&s;tions as the&s;e.</P>
<P>What have been my <HI>perceptions of Sin?</HI> Have I ever had any &s;orrowful reflections in my brea&s;t, at the thought that I am a &s;inner? Has a &s;en&s;e of &s;in been grievous to me? Have I had upon my mind a con&s;ci|ou&s;ne&s;s of guilt? Have I had a view of my &s;elf as ex|po&s;ed to the wrath of almighty GOD, and been in con|cern hereat, and inqui&s;itive how I might e&s;cape? If you can't &s;ay thus of your &s;elves, you have rea&s;on to be afraid of your condition. You, to be &s;ure, have rea&s;on to be &s;o, who han't been under re&s;traints from &s;in, but have <HI>walk'd in the way of your own hearts, and in the &s;ight of your own eyes, adding iniquity to tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ion.</HI> Is it rea&s;onable to think &s;uch &s;inners, as you are, &s;hould be brought to a right mind, without &s;evere and

bitter reflections on your &s;elves? 'Tis not po&s;&s;ible, you &s;hould have a ju&s;t conception of your &s;elves, and of the real truth of your character, and not be in deep anxiety of Soul: Nor may you imagine, you have been &s;a|vingly chang'd from a &s;tate of &s;in to a &s;tate of grace, if you have had no remor&s;e of con&s;cience, no unea&s;i|ne&s;s in your brea&s;ts on account of your &s;ins, no fear of the Divine maje&s;ty, nor of the vengeance of the eter|nal world. Such, who&s;e ca&s;e this is, have upon them the &s;ad marks of being to this day in <HI>the gall of bitter|ne&s;s, and in the bonds of iniquity.</HI> And oh! of how many, may it be feared, is this the ju&s;t character! Are there not multitudes <HI>at ea&s;e in Zion,</HI> who have upon their minds no concern about their &s;ins, no fear of the Divine wrath; but are going on calmly and quietly in the broad way to death and hell? If there are any here pre&s;ent, who&s;e con&s;ciences tell them, they are the men, let me be&s;eech you, as you love your &s;ouls, and would not be the de&s;troyers of them, to bethink your &s;elves. Whether you will believe it or not, you are, as &s;inners again&s;t the GOD that made you, the proper objects of hell, and nothing keeps you out of that place of weeping and wailing and gna&s;hing of teeth, but the patience of a provoked GOD, which may even this day come to an end with you. And is this a condition to be ea&s;y in? O be convinced of your danger! You are certainly in circum&s;tances of amazing hazard: O realize it to be &s;o! and bow your knee to the GOD and FATHER of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, be&s;eeching him, with a becoming importunity of &s;oul, to have mercy upon you. Your help is only in GOD, through JESUS CHRIST. O cry mightily to him! He may hear from heaven, and convert and &s;ave you.</P>
<P>But if upon inquiry you &s;hould find, you have been under unea&s;y &s;en&s;ations from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;in and guilt, re&s;t not &s;atisfied with this; but go on and in|quire, how the&s;e <HI>perceptions</HI> have operated, what has

been the effect of them. In them&s;elves, <HI>convictions</HI> are no &s;ufficient evidence of a good &s;tate. You may have roared out by rea&s;on of the di&s;quietne&s;s within you, and yet be at a di&s;tance from GOD and grace. Don't be content that you have been under awakenings, but examine into their i&s;&s;ue. Have you herefrom &s;een your need of CHRIST? Have you repaired to him as the SAVIOUR of undone &s;inners? Have you been ena|bled to place your tru&s;t in him, and in him alone for righteou&s;ne&s;s and eternal life? Are you become <HI>new men?</HI> Have you experienced that change, which will denominate you the children of GOD, and born from above? Be critical in your inquiry into this matter. Is the change you have pa&s;&s;ed under, a change only in your affections? Is it nothing more than a little out|ward reformation? Does it lie only in an attendance on <HI>&s;ermons</HI> and <HI>lectures?</HI> Or is it indeed a change from the power of &s;in and &s;atan, a change into the likene&s;s of GOD? Have you, in truth, been made partakers of the <HI>Divine nature?</HI> Have you been transformed, by the renewing of your mind, into the image of CHRIST JESUS? Unle&s;s the Image of the Devil has been de|faced in you, and&punc; you have been really chang'd into a re&s;emblance to the ble&s;&s;ed GOD, and his SON JESUS CHRIST, notwith&s;tanding all your other experiences, be they what they will, and as many and as great as they will, you are yet in your &s;ins; you are yet in &s;uch a &s;tate, as that if you &s;hould go out of the world with|out a further change, you would certainly mi&s;s of hea|ven, and be &s;ent away to hell.</P>
<P>And let me tell you, if you have indeed been <HI>re|newed in the &s;pirit of your minds,</HI> it will &s;hew it &s;elf in your <HI>lives.</HI> The change that has been wrought in you will have an influence upon your whole outward con|duct and behaviour. You will leave off former &s;ins, and put in practice neglected duties. As the grace of GOD teaches, you will deny ungodline&s;s, and wordly

You will attend the duties of piety, be|come men of prayer, the devout wor&s;hippers of GOD, in the clo&s;et, in the family, and in the place where he records his name. You will keep under re&s;traint your pa&s;&s;ions of wrath, and anger, and hatred; you will ab&s;tain from all filthy talking and je&s;ting: And as for the gro&s;s acts of uncleanne&s;s and intemperance, they will not be &s;o much as named among you. In fine, you will do to others as you would they &s;hould do to you. You will put away lying, and &s;peak every man truth with his neighbour. You will be fair and equi|table in your treatment of mankind; hone&s;t in your dealings; faithful to your promi&s;es: All clamour and evil-&s;peaking, you will lay a&s;ide; with all &s;landering, back-biting, tatling and tale-bearing: And you will (as the elect of GOD) put on bowels of mercies, kind|ne&s;s, humblene&s;s of mind, meekne&s;s, long &s;uffering; forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, as GOD for CHRIST's &s;ake forgiveth you. And above all the&s;e things, you will put on <HI>charity,</HI> which is the bond of perfectne&s;s. In one word, there will be an amendment of your carriage in all the <HI>relations</HI> you &s;u&s;tain.

In this the children of GOD are manife&s;t, and the children of the Devil: Who&s;oever doth not righteou&s;ne&s;s is not of GOD, neither he that loveth not his brother.</P>

I can't but think it is <HI>now</HI> a <HI>&s;pecial &s;ea&s;on</HI> for <HI>prayer.</HI> Let us unite in our cries to the GOD, who dwelleth on high. &mdash;&mdash; Let us pray for a <HI>general effu|&s;ion</HI> of the SPIRIT upon the <HI>land</HI>; and that he may come down, not only as a Spirit of <HI>humiliation</HI> and <HI>&s;anctification,</HI> but as a Spirit of <HI>wi&s;dom,</HI> that &s;o they who are <HI>zealous</HI> may be <HI>prudently</HI> and <HI>knowingly</HI> &s;o; and they who are <HI>pious</HI> exemplarily &s;o, adorning the doctrine of GOD their SAVIOUR in all things, and cutting off occa&s;ion from them who might be glad of occa&s;ion to &s;peak evil of them.</P>
<P>In fine, Let us the people of GOD, who u&s;ually wor&s;hip in this place, <HI>pray</HI> for the <HI>out-pouring</HI> of the SPIRIT upon <HI>our &s;elves</HI> more particularly. Ble&s;&s;ed be GOD, we are not wholly without the influences of his SPIRIT. Some, we tru&s;t, have had experience of his operations on their &s;ouls. The LORD increa&s;e their number! The LORD grant, that the SPIRIT may fall from on high on the whole congregation! Let us pray that it may be &s;o; that the HOLY GHOST may be <HI>poured out,</HI> both upon <HI>Pa&s;tors</HI> and <HI>people,</HI> upon high and low, rich and poor, male and female, bond and free, old and young, to the revival of the things which remain and are ready to die.</P>
<P>This is the ble&s;&s;ing we are come to a&s;k of GOD. O let us be importunate in our cries to him for it! Let us pray with an importunity that &s;hall pierce even heaven.</P>
<P>And let us not think it enough that we join together in the <HI>public prayers</HI> of this day; but let us go on with our <HI>prayers.</HI> Let us each one pray to GOD by <HI>our &s;elves,</HI> and with <HI>our families:</HI> And let us pray, and cea&s;e not.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="004914_0043_100E2BDF6C05A358">And while we pray for the SPIRIT, let us beware of every thing that may have a tendency to prevent his in|fluences being &s;hed upon us. Let us be upon our guard again&s;t all &s;in, and tho&s;e &s;ins in &s;pecial, by which GOD may be provok'd to withhold from us his ble&s;&s;ed SPIRIT. Let us take heed, that we don't harbour prejudices in our minds again&s;t the SPIRIT, his <HI>office</HI> and <HI>work</HI> upon the hearts of &s;inners: And while we are ready to give to the divine SPIRIT the honour of tho&s;e <HI>operations</HI> that are truly <HI>his,</HI> let us maintain a care that we don't reflect di&s;grace upon him by ma|king him the author of tho&s;e things, which are unwor|thy of him: The SPIRIT may be di&s;honoured both the&s;e ways; and perhaps he has been as much re|proach'd by the <HI>latter</HI> as he has been &s;lighted by the <HI>former.</HI></P>
<P>We &s;hould al&s;o be diligent in our attendance on <HI>all means,</HI> e&s;pecially <HI>the word preached. Sabbaths</HI> mu&s;t be ob&s;erved. &mdash; GOD mu&s;t be waited on at his <HI>hou&s;e</HI>; his <HI>wor&s;hip</HI> regarded; his <HI>word,</HI> in the <HI>mini&s;try</HI> of it, attended to. GOD is often pre&s;ent by his SPIRIT, when the <HI>word</HI> is di&s;pen&s;ed. We read in my text of many up|on whom the HOLY GHOST <HI>fell,</HI> while they were <HI>hearing the word.</HI> And 'tis ob&s;erved of the <HI>Galatians,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. 3.2.</NOTE> that they <HI>received the</HI> SPIRIT <HI>by the heareng of faith.</HI> i. e. the preaching of the <HI>word of faith,</HI> the Go&s;pel of CHRIST. But then, you mu&s;t not think, that <HI>hearing of Sermons</HI> is all that is nece&s;&s;ary. You mu&s;t &s;o hear as to find time for <HI>meditation, &s;elf-examination,</HI> and a &s;erious <HI>&s;elf-application.</HI> And you mu&s;t come to hear without any previous bia&s;s upon your minds, without prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and prejudices again&s;t either the <HI>word,</HI> or the <HI>di&s;pen&s;er</HI> of it. You mu&s;t come with minds open to conviction, willing to receive the truth, as it

is in JESUS; otherwi&s;e the be&s;t preaching in the world will be of no &s;ervice to you.</P>
<P>In a word, you mu&s;t make it the great bu&s;ine&s;s of your lives to obtain the influences of the holy SPIRIT. This, you mu&s;t e&s;teem, the main thing; and here you mu&s;t lay out your chief &s;trength. This mu&s;t be your continual care. You mu&s;t make it your main bu&s;i|ne&s;s; &s;ubordinating your other affairs to this which is of the greate&s;t importance.</P>
<P>And if it &s;hall plea&s;e GOD to <HI>pour out his</HI> SPIRIT upon us, then &s;hall we remember from whence we are fallen, and repent and do our fir&s;t works; then will the work of religion pro&s;per among us, &s;inners be awa|ken'd, humbled and converted, and &s;aints be quicken'd and enliven'd. Then &s;hall we flouri&s;h like the palm-tree, and grow like the cedar in Lebanon, and being planted in the courts of our GOD, &s;hall bring forth fruit, even till old age, to &s;hew that the LORD is up|right: Which GOD of his infinite mercy grant for the &s;ake of CHRIST JESUS, to whom be glory for ever and ever. AMEN.</P>
