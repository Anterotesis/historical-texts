<P>How this natural Philo&s;ophy doth a|gree, I &s;hall not here &s;tand to cen&s;ure, but &s;ay it mu&s;t be this Obligation or &s;ome other Obligation; but it can be no other Obigation, for any other Obli|gation mu&s;t needs tend to make God Na|ture's Bond-&s;lave, which would be abo|minable; this mu&s;t &s;pring then from the <HI>Wol&s;ton-<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters"> Deis-men's</HI> Opinion, that is, that God made all Things in the State &amp; Nature that they now, &s;tand, &amp; in clo|&s;ed up in an <HI>Onus,</HI> or <HI>Sphere,</HI> out of which they cannot pa&s;s; nor to any thing perti|cular hath God any regard: So that every thing an&s;wereth it's Purpo&s;e, and every Action that is done, an&s;wereth to the good of one another; and that every one hath Free-will to do what he li&s;t|eth

<P>I could make many notable Ob&s;er|vations, and &s;hew it demon&s;trably Plain in the current Cour&s;e of Actions and Things, but as it Interfereth not with my De&s;ign here, I now turn back to the Matter.</P>
<P>Seeing God can do nothing Incon&s;i&s;t|ent to the Law of Nature: If I can prove from the Holy Records, That Nature and it's Law is at this Time contrary to God, and not Subject un|to Gods Law, either the Go&s;pel Re|cord mu&s;t be Fal&s;e, or the Pamphlets Propo&s;ition Fal&s;e.

Was not this the &s;ame that they taught others? Was not that
<PB N="22" REF="005060_0020_1016983184F8DB90">the &s;ame that was carefully made Mat|ter of Record of, and handed down from Age to Age, for a Rule of Life and Manners, to all Chri&s;tian Men of all A|ges.</P>
<P><HI>Ob&s;ervation the &s;econd:</HI> It was &s;ome what of a My&s;try to me, and &s;till is &s;o how you fir&s;t laid down your Propo&s;i|tion upon general Terms; and after good Part of your Argument grounded upon it, You attempted to re&s;trict it to a &s;crap of the Law of Nature: I &s;hould have been &s;o fooli&s;h as to have thought a Man might as well have moved the Foundation of a Stone Build|ing, when the Edifice was in great Part erected upon it. No, no more then you can mend an original Write made by good In&s;tructions, after I&s;&s;ue is joined upon it: And I am apt to think that you have made &s;o demon|&s;trably Plain what you intended and meant by the Law of Nature, at fir&s;t, that I am doubtful that you will get the &s;ame Prai&s;e and Aplaud from the Learned, as tho&s;e good Hou&s;e-Wives give tho&s;e corrupt Tinkers that mend one Hole in their Pan and make two.</P>

<HI>Ob&s;ervation the third:</HI> Suppo&s;e that you and I are convinced that the Law and Wars both bottom upon one Bot|tom, and that they are great Evils, and many evil Con&s;equencies attend them both, as both are Harbingers of Stri&s;e, Wrath, Di&s;cord, Envy, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> as you &s;ay, &s;o &s;ay I in that Ca&s;e; and to your Que&s;tion (<HI>viz</HI>) doth it therefore follow that its good in no Ca&s;e: I an&s;wer, it is good for a Chri&s;tian Man to &s;hun e|ven every Appearence of Evil: Yet it is good among&s;t &s;uch as have no Faith in God, &s;uch as are without God in the World, that have not the Grace of God in them to inable them to be a Law to them&s;elves, that depend in the Arm of Fre&s;h more than in the Power of God; &s;uch as look upon things altoge|ther after the outward Appearence, and choo&s;e to cleave to the Practice of other Pagan Notions, that know not God, nor nought believe of his Promi&s;es; to all &s;uch the Laws of Wars are good: But it doth not follow that Men are Convinced of all Evils, therefore they are convinced of none.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="005060_0022_101698371A8F83C8">
Can any rea&s;onable Creature allow it to &s;tand with Love to Truth and Man|kind, to preach up, that becau&s;e Men are not convinced of all Evils, there|fore they ought not to &s;ay they are convinced of any Evil: Becau&s;e they are not convinced that the Law is an Evil, therefore they ought not to pre|tend to be convinced that War is an Evil: Becau&s;e through frail Infirmity Men are attended with many Evils, therefore they mu&s;t Object again&s;t no Evil: Becau&s;e Men are not Convinced that the Law is Evil therefore they mu&s;t not Object again&s;t War as an Evil, tho' they are convinced it is an Evil. For all the drift and &s;cope of all the doctrine contained in the Pamphlet is, <HI>why if War be an Evil: So is this, and &s;o is that: Wo be to them that &s;et evil for good.</HI> The whole &s;cope of Doctrine tends not to refute Evil by Scripture Authority and good Rea&s;on, but aims and &s;trives to &s;upport one Evil by ano|ther, or a greater Evil by a le&s;&s;er; and in that order to &s;ecure and fortify all Evils &s;ecurely together: And this is
<PB N="25" REF="005060_0023_1016983B08667B70">the real drift of the Pamphlet, as far as I can &s;ee into it.</P>
<P>So you may &s;ee, that no Truth can come of a Fal&s;e Propo&s;ition, and alto|gether &s;avoureth of the <HI>Athei&s;tick, Deis-Mens, Sadducetical</HI> Principles in my Opinion; and the Author was plea&s;ed, in one of his Religious Chapters, with a great Sum to &s;um up the Principles of his pretended Society: With Submi&s;&s;i|on, did you by your Religious Pam|phlet intend to &s;hew us, your poor ig|norant Readers, tho&s;e Performances as the Fruits and Produce of the&s;e Princi|ples, or to thereby let us know you were clean departed from all &s;uch like Principles? As to my own part, I do freely confe&s;s I am not qualified with &s;uch Aquirements as to put me in a Capacity to judge of your Religious Performances from the Symtoms of the Epithete, with certainty, for &s;hould I with my weak Abilities con|&s;ult the Epithets, it would, I doubt, be the fir&s;t Que&s;tion to be determined, whether or no you and tho&s;e Principles (that you ca&s;t up with &s;uch great Sum, in order to let us know what extraor|dinary
<PB N="26" REF="005060_0024_1016983C925A9FA8">Principles you are Ma&s;ter of, as Member of that Society) ever met in any other Manner than a Borrower may meet with a Thing to be lent? and then it will fall out odly: If the fir&s;t Que&s;tion &s;hould determine negatively, it might chance to give Cau&s;e from my ignorant Judgment upon the Symp|toms of the &s;hewing Nature of the Epi|thets, to conclude you as great a <HI>Pel|liculator</HI> and <HI>Hypocrite</HI> in Ca&s;es of Religi|on, as ever trod <HI>Kenti&s;h</HI> Ground: From hence it might ri&s;e the&s;e Conjectures from natural Con&s;equences, <HI>That he that was &s;uch a gro&s;s</HI> Pelliculator <HI>and</HI> Hypocrite <HI>in Ca&s;es of Religion, and Things belonging to God and Con&s;cience; why not in all other Ca&s;es?</HI> So, I &s;ay, to avoid all this, I refu&s;e to Con&s;ult the Epithets or Concrete, and content my &s;elf only to ask the Que&s;tion, and wait my An&s;wer from you, the Author of tho&s;e Religious Chapters.</P>
<P>I may well a&s;&s;ure you that its not with any Plea&s;ure, and much le&s;s in a|ny in&s;ulting Manner, that I am obliged to treat the Author of tho&s;e Religious Performances in this &s;ort of &s;reedom of

<P>In my &s;imple way of thinking, I do know my&s;elf to be a Man but of weak Capacities, and yet I &s;hould have realy thought it but a Piece of good Ju&s;tice done me, if Mr. <HI>Bicker&s;taff</HI> had put me into his Bedlem, for Tatling over &s;uch a Huffe of Vaniety: It would have been much more &s;urprizing then it is to me, had I not been acquainted with the &s;tories of the old Religious Fa|thers, who when they attempted to make u&s;e of Religion as a Cloak or Screen to infoi&s;t Aims, Vews and Ends of Thing, of a contrary different Na|ture; why they always have thereby runned them&s;elves into Redicule and Confu&s;ion.</P>
