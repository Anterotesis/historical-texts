<P>THe Subject-Matter of the en&s;uing Di&s;cour&s;e is repre&s;ented &s;ummarily in the foregoing Contents. And a little comparing of the Heads propo&s;ed to be handled, with the &s;tate of things among&s;t the generality of them who are called Chri&s;tians in the World, will &s;ufficiently evidence the &s;ea&s;onablene&s;s of managing &s;uch a De&s;ign, or publi&s;hing Di&s;cour&s;es of this nature. Wherefore the things treated of being &s;uch, as at fir&s;t view will extort an acknowledment from all per&s;ons not under the power of avowed Athei&s;m, that they are of the greate&s;t Importance; the open Pre&s;umptions and Security of the minds of many under the pre&s;ent decays of Light and Truth, both in their Power and Di&s;pen&s;ation, rendering their propo&s;al and pre&s;&s;ing on the Con&s;ciences of men, both &s;ea&s;onable and nece&s;&s;a|ry; there is nothing further to be con&s;idered about them; but only how the <HI>Author</HI> of this Treati&s;e hath aquitted and di&s;charged him&s;elf in the management of his De&s;ign: This by an unexpected Providence in the Death of a worthy Per&s;on who furthered the Publication of it, is required of me, with an Importunity

which I could not with&s;tand, to deliver my thoughts unto. For although the Treati&s;e be &s;uch in the whole, and all the parts of it, as needeth no Recommendation of mine, nor of others though of more weight and Authority than in any thing I pretend unto, nor perhaps will any thing that I can &s;ay contribute much unto its e&s;teem with others; Yet out of that re&s;pect which I bear to the worthy <HI>Author,</HI> in that great di&s;tance from us wherein the Provi|dence of God hath fixed his &s;tation in's Church and the World, I was not unwilling in a few words to declare my Judgment of his Labour in this matter, if &s;o be it might prove a means to further the reception and u&s;efullne&s;s of it in the World. The Apo&s;tolical Rule is, that in <HI>Doctrine</HI> the Mini&s;ters of the Word &s;hould <HI>&s;hew Uncorruptne&s;s, Gravity, Sincerity, &s;ound Speech that cannot be condemned.</HI> And I think I may &s;ay without offence, &s;ub|miting my Judgment unto that of other Readers, that I have not &s;een many Treati&s;es of this nature, wherein <HI>that Rule</HI> hath been more diligently attended unto. What&s;oever el&s;e the Author aimed at, it is evident that <HI>plain|ne&s;s, per&s;picuity, gravity</HI> in delivering the Truth, were continually in his eye; nor hath he come &s;hort of attaining his De&s;ign.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Grace and Peace from God by Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE holy Apo&s;tles of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, although they were &s;ent forth, with a largene&s;s and fulne&s;s of Power, (their Commi&s;&s;ion ex|tending it &s;elf as far as every Creature, that is, every Man, (for the Hebrews were wont to call <HI>Man</HI> by that name of <HI>Creature</HI>) or men of all &s;orts, and in all places; the Lord having &s;aid to them, <HI>Go ye into all the World &amp; Preach the Go&s;pel to every Creature: he that believeth and is baptized, &s;hall be &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ved; but he that believeth not, &s;hall be damned</HI>:) Neverthele&s;s it is evident not only from tho&s;e that write the Lives and Travles of the Apo&s;tles, but al&s;o from the &s;acred Scriptures, that they did by mutual Con&s;ent, divide the World among them|&s;elves, each taking a &s;everal part thereof, as h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s more &s;pecial Charge. Hence is that <HI>Rule, Line, Mea&s;ures,</HI> which we read of

2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10.14, 15, 16. intimating that tho&s;e that were inve&s;ted with Apo&s;tolical Au|thority, yet had one this, and another that portion of the World, <HI>mea&s;ured</HI> out as his more peculiar. <HI>Allotment</HI> to Travel and Labour in <HI>John</HI>'s more peculiar Charge was in the le&s;&s;er <HI>A&s;ia; Paul</HI> taketh the Gentiles, and <HI>Peter</HI> the Jewi&s;h World before him, <HI>Gal</HI> 2.7, 8, 9. Accordingly we find them not only by word, but al&s;o by <HI>Epi&s;tle,</HI> &s;pecially endeavouring the good of tho&s;e a|mong&s;t whom their appropriated charge lay. <HI>John</HI> doth by the Commandment of Chri&s;t write to the &s;even A&s;iatick Churches. <HI>Paul</HI> directs mo&s;t of his Epi&s;tles to believing Gentiles. <HI>Peter</HI> being Conver&s;ant in <HI>Babylon</HI> (which was &s;aith <HI>Scaligar A&s;ianae metroplis)</HI> doth from thence write to the <HI>di&s;per&s;ed Jews</HI> who&s;e welfare (above others) he did &s;eek to promote.

Some of you (and through grace many of you) are brought out of the mi&s;erable e&s;tate of Sin &amp; Nature, truely to clo&s;e with Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and with God in him; to you I would commend what is here concerning <HI>working

out</HI> your Salvation, and concerning the&s;e <HI>re|newed and &s;econd Conver&s;ions,</HI> which even Chri&s;t's own Di&s;ciples may &s;tand in need of.</P>
<P>Others of you (and to &s;peak the truth plainly to you) by far the greate&s;t part of you, (the more is my grief) among&s;t whom I have for thus many years been preaching the Go&s;pel of the Kingdom, are to this day in a natural <HI>iregenerate e&s;tate</HI>; Do you con&s;ider what is here &s;aid concerning <HI>the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of a true Conver&s;ion unto God in Chri&s;t, and the exceeding danger of living unprofitably under the means of Grace, and that God</HI>'s <HI>Spirit may &s;oon give you over and then you are undone.</HI> Yea let all of you con&s;ider and re|member, that <HI>Chri&s;t knocketh at your doors; and that precious time &s;hould be redeemed,</HI> and that &s;trait is the Gate and narrow is the Way, which leadeth unto life, <HI>and few there be that find it.</HI></P>
<P>And as the &s;ence of my own mortality drew me both to publi&s;h and preach the&s;e <HI>Sermons</HI>; &s;o likewi&s;e the &s;ame thing cau&s;eth me at this time, and in this way to &s;peak a few &s;olomn words to you, and to leave them upon Record among you.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t word that I would &s;ay to you is this, <HI>for that little time which I &s;hall continue with you, let me have the help of your fervent and con&s;tant Prayers.</HI> I believe you will all acknowledge, that my clo&s;ing with your de&s;ires (which I with&s;tood for divers years
<PB N="x" REF="002260_0012_0FDADEEF06B5B278">
together) in coming under that dreadful bond of Office-Relation, was the return and an&s;wer of your Prayers, yea of your extra|ordinary Seekings unto God about that matter; and I doubt not but you will all lay, that my being delivered from &s;o great a death as that which above two years ago I was under the Sentence of, is al&s;o an Evi|dence that God hath heard your Prayers: Now then the experience of the <HI>power</HI> which your Prayers have with God as it doth encourage me to de&s;ire them, &s;o let it engage you to continue them. See then (for it is your duty &s;o to do) that whenever you fall upon your knees in your Clo&s;ets to pray for your own Souls, that you bear me upon your hearts and make particular mention of my poor name before the Lord: what &s;hall I &s;ay unto you? I might tell you that equity requireth this at your hands; for God is witne&s;s, and day and night &s;eeth it, that I am mindful of you before the throne of grace, and that almo&s;t <HI>in every Prayer of mine.</HI> And I might &s;ay to you, that if you grant my reque&s;t herein the benefit will be your own, <HI>All things are yours</HI>; my Gifts (&s;uch weak ones as they are) my Time, my Studies, all of them are yours, who are <HI>my dearly beloved, and your Salvation longed for.</HI> If Chri&s;t fill me, I &s;hall be the better able to give out to you. The more of the Gifts and Graces of the Spirit that a Mini&s;ter doth
<PB N="xi" REF="002260_0013_0FDADEB259D18EE0">
receive from above, the better it is for them that wait upon his Mini&s;try. Therefore deny me <HI>not</HI> if you expect your own Spiritual Welfare. But I will &s;ay moreover, that <HI>I need your Prayers</HI>; and therefore let me have them. You &s;ee and cannot but be &s;en&s;ible of the &s;tate of the Lord's poor <HI>New-England People</HI>; Our Prophets and our Fathers <HI>where are they?</HI> It is &s;ad, but &s;o it is, <HI>New-Eng|land hath of late been a grave of God's Am|ba&s;&s;adors.</HI> Therefore tho&s;e few that yet &s;urvive, need &s;o much the more the help of the Prayers of God's praying people; <HI>Pauls</HI> are departed, pray then for <HI>Timothies, Daniels</HI> are gone to re&s;t, pray then for <HI>Haggai</HI>'s and <HI>Zacharies,</HI> that do &s;ucceed; <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>'s are dead, pray that the Lord would take of the Spirit which was i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Mo&s;es, and put it upon the <HI>Elders of I&s;rael; Elijahs</HI> are taken up; pray then that the Lord Spirit may be doubled upon &s;ucceeding &amp;c &s;urviving <HI>Eli&s;haes,</HI> and in &s;pecial upon him that now &s;peaketh to you, who is the lea&s;t among all the Lord's Servants, and not worthy to be called a Mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t.

Miracle to make them <HI>under&s;tand</HI> the <HI>tongues,</HI> than that they &s;hould be unlearned &s;till. Yea the truth is, that there never was any man eminently &s;erviceable as a Teacher in the Church &s;ince the Apo&s;tles, except he were a Learned man. Antient (Fathers as they were called) who defended the Truth again&s;t the Heathen Philo&s;ophers and the Hereticks of tho&s;e times, &s;uch as <HI>Ju&s;tin Martyr, Cyprian Au&s;tin, Hierom, &amp;c.</HI> were Learned men: And had &s;ome of them had more Learning in the Original Languages, it had been better for them, and for the Church of God; for there|by many a mi&s;interpretaion of the Scripture would have been prevented.

<Q>That it is a most certain and weighty Truth, that a &s;ound, through Conver&s;ion is of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity, in order to the Souls en|trance into the Kingdom of Heaven.</Q></P>

This is plainly affirmed by the Text, Chri&s;t declareth to his Di&s;ciples, that except that Lu&s;t of Pride were further mortified in them, they &s;hould not enter into Heaven. Some &s;ins which true Be|lievers are guilty of, they mu&s;t and &s;hall repent of them before they go out of this World, that &s;o they may be fit for Heaven.</P>

is nece&s;&s;ary: Ordinarily it is thus with <HI>new Converts</HI>; in &s;uch, many times Grace is very weak, and Corruption is very &s;trong; there is little Knowledge, &amp; much Ignorance; little Humility, &amp; much Pride; and thence a further Conver&s;ion mu&s;t be. This we &s;ee in the Di&s;ciples them&s;elves, a long time they were marvellou&s;ly Ignorant, &amp; yet too full of Pride and other corrup|tions: But after the A&s;cen&s;ion of Chri&s;t, there was a mighty change wrought in them; <HI>Then was that accompli&s;hed upon them, which here Christ &s;aid must be, a new Conver|&s;ion,</HI> they were <HI>endued with a power from on high,</HI> Luke 24.49. The Lord from on high poured his Spirit mightly upon them, &amp; thereby were <HI>they</HI> wonderfully changed; The change which was then wro't upon the Di&s;ciples, was not much le&s;s, than that which was wrought on them at their fir&s;t conver&s;ion; they differed from what them|&s;elves were afore, well nigh as much as at their fir&s;t Conver&s;ion they were made to differ from other men.</P>
<P>Again, True Believers may be under &s;ad Spiritual decays, and in this re&s;pect they may need, as it were, a <HI>new Conver&s;ion.</HI> This we &s;ee in the colla&s;ped Churches of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> yea, a godly man may fall into gro&s;s &s;ins, &s;uch as wa&s;te and wound the Con&s;cience, and break communion with

<P>Prop. VI. <HI>In true Conver&s;ion, there is a change, even of the whole man.</HI> The &s;anctify|ing change wrought in <HI>conver&s;ion,</HI> mu&s;t be proportionable to the <HI>defilement</HI> of natural Corruption.

This Corruption of Nature was Typified under the Law by the &s;preading Lepro&s;ie <HI>(Lev.</HI> 13.12, 13.) which <HI>covered all the skin of him that had the Plague, from his head even to his foot.</HI> Now the Plai&s;ter mu&s;t be an&s;werable to the Sore; therefore ina&s;much as the Corruption of Nature is univer&s;al, as to all parts and fa|culties; &s;o mu&s;t Repentance &amp; Conver&s;ion be univer&s;al.

the top to the bottom; it's &s;uch another change as that, which &s;hall pa&s;s upon the World at the la&s;t and Great Day; Indeed, then the materials &s;hall be the &s;ame, but there will be a wonderful alteration as to qualities; &s;o it is when a Soul is <HI>converted.</HI> As if a man &s;hould deface a deformed Pi|cture, and in the room of it &s;hould draw another compleat and beauiful; here the &s;ubject matter is the &s;ame, only her's a new Image. Thus the Holy Spirit draweth the ble&s;&s;ed Lines of the Image of God on that Soul, where once was the deformed Image of Satan. But to evince the truth of this Propo&s;ition, by Induction of particulars: 1. In <HI>conver&s;ion, the head is made new.</HI> A true <HI>convert</HI> hath a <HI>renewed mind,</HI> Eph. 4 23. Hence <HI>Conver&s;ion</HI> is in the Scripture called, <HI>Illumination,</HI> Heb. 10.32. &amp; <HI>opening of the eyes</HI> of the Soul, <HI>Acts</HI> 26.18. <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.18. When|ever God converts a Soul, he lets in a new, and a ble&s;&s;ed light into the Under&s;tanding, that the &s;inner hath other apprehen&s;ions about God, and Chri&s;t, and Heaven, and Sin, &amp; Hell, &amp; Spiritual objects, than once he had. Every <HI>converted</HI> &s;inner may &s;ay, as the man that was born blind &s;aid, after Je&s;us Chri&s;t had healed him, <HI>John</HI> 9.25. <HI>One thing I know, that whereas I was born

blind, now I &s;ee.</HI> Some that are truly <HI>Con|verted,</HI> cannot tell exactly the time, or the means, or manner of their <HI>Conver&s;ion</HI>; yet this they know, that now they &s;ee Spirit|ual things with another kind of &s;ight and apprehen&s;ion, then once they did. The truth is, that <HI>conver&s;ion</HI> doth begin here: As in the <HI>first Creation</HI> God began with <HI>light,</HI> &s;o in this &s;econd and new Creation, the Lord begins with effectual Conviction and Illumination&punc; 2 In <HI>Conver&s;ion, the heart</HI> is made new, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 36.26. <HI>A new heart will I give. Converting Grace</HI> is promi&s;ed to the Elect under that expre&s;&s;ion. <HI>A new heart</HI> is given to a man, when that heart which once was hard &amp; &s;en&s;le&s;s, is become &s;oft &amp; tender; <HI>when an heart of &s;tone, is turned into an heart of fle&s;h</HI>; and when that heart which once was full of nothing but pride and vanity, is become humble and meek. And when that heart which was fooli&s;h is be|come Spiritually wi&s;e, <HI>Prov.</HI> 10.8. The Heart is oft in Scripture, put for the Will, becau&s;e it is the &s;eed and &s;ubject thereof, as the head is of the Under&s;tanding.

Grace, the Will is captivated. The Will then refu&s;eth old &s;inful Objects which once were delighted in; and in&s;tead thereof, chu&s;eth new and better Objects: That Will which before was ob&s;tinate and rebellious, is now become pliable to the will of God in every thing. You &s;ee it in <HI>Paul,</HI> when he was in the Pangs of the new birth, <HI>Lord,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>what wilt thou have me to do?</HI> Acts; 9.6. And this alone proveth the truth of the Propo&s;ition before us; for a change of the Heart or Will, infers a change of the whole man; the Rea&s;on is, becau&s;e the Will is the Empre&s;s and Commandre&s;s of the Soul. Hence the act of any faculty or part belonging to a man, is not to be ac|counted the act of the whole, except the Will be involved in it. 3. In conver&s;ion, <HI>the affections are renewed:</HI> A &s;incere Convert doth not affect tho&s;e evils, which once he did affect; and doth affect tho&s;e good things which once he did not affect; Converting Grace cau&s;eth a marvellous change upon the affections; <HI>e. g.</HI> If we &s;peak of Love &amp; Haterd&punc; when a &s;inner is Converted, the&s;e affections are much altered and placed up|on new and other Objects: He loveth Spiritual good things in the chief place; he loveth God and Chri&s;t above all, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 73.25. <HI>Luke</HI> 14.26. he loveth Truth,

Again, the &s;incere Convert hath new joys and &s;orrows in his Soul. As for the Natural man his chief joy &amp; delight is in &s;ome carnal, worldly Object, either in the Plea&s;ures, or Profits, or Honours which the World affords: But as for the Converted man his chief delight is in Spiritual Objects; as in the favour of God, and communion with him by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and in the precious Promi&s;es, <HI>&amp;c,</HI> yea, he finds more &s;weetne&s;s in one good look from God in Chri&s;t, or in one Promi&s;e, than in all that the whole Earth can afford, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 4.6. &amp; 94 19&punc; So for Sorrow; the greate&s;t &s;orrows of a Natural man, are upon the account of <HI>&s;ome</HI> worldly cro&s;s or di&s;appointment; but the Converted man is grieved mo&s;t of all with the lo&s;s of Gods favour, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 30.6. and with the di&s;honour done to Gods name in the World, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 119.136, 158. as to <HI>intel|lectual and rational &s;orrow,</HI> Sin is the matter of greate&s;t grief unto his Soul, e&s;pecially tho&s;e &s;ins which before Conver&s;ion were the mo&s;t delightful, after Conver&s;ion are the greate&s;t bitterne&s;s of Soul. Again, where there is true <HI>Conver&s;ion,</HI> there are new hopes and fears; his hopes are placed chiefly upon Eternal Objects, upon Chri&s;t, and Heaven,

and Eternal Life, <HI>Col.</HI> 1.5, 27. and the like may be &s;aid concerning his Fear, it is not placed &s;o much upon Temporal, as upon Spiritual and Eternal Objects. I do but touch at things is we go along; but by this you &s;ee, that <HI>Converting Grace</HI> makes a won|derful change upon the affections; yea, upon all the affections, whether they be affections of <HI>&V;nion,</HI> or affections of <HI>Aver&s;ation.</HI> 4. In Conver&s;ion, there are <HI>new thoughts</HI> put into the heart; &amp; if there be a real &amp; through change, in re&s;pect of the thoughts, it is a &s;pecial Evidence of true Conver&s;ion, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 55.7. An Unconverted &s;inner, or one that hath only a common work of Gods Spirit upon him may po&s;&s;ibly make &s;ome Con&s;cience of his words and outward actions; but it's rare for &s;uch an one to look narrowly and dili|gently to the inward thoughts and workings of his heart; but where the Go&s;pel prevaileth to a &s;ound Conver&s;ion of the Soul, it brings <HI>every thought</HI> into &s;ubjection to the will of God, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10.5.

again&s;t the highe&s;t and mo&s;t &s;piritual light that ever &s;hone upon men.

unfruitfulne&s;s is the ready way to be de|prived of Go&s;pel Ordinances, and all the means of Grace. Sometimes indeed God doth take away men from the means, be|cau&s;e of this &s;in; hence the Lord &s;triketh them with &s;ickne&s;s, that they cannot come a|broad to the publick A&s;&s;emblies of his People, though they would; nay, with death it &s;elf. Thus we &s;ee in the <HI>Corinthians</HI> (ch. 11.) though they were true Believers, and &s;uch as &s;hould not be condemned with the World at the great Day; yet becau&s;e they did not come to, and profit by that Ordi|nance of the Lords Supper as they &s;hould have done, therefore &s;ickne&s;s and death be|fel them.

<P>Con&s;ider 1. <HI>That you are not, you cannot be Chri&s;tians indeed, except you be fruitful.</HI> It is given as the Character of a <HI>fal&s;e Chri&s;tian,</HI> or
<PB N="79" REF="002260_0103_0FDADF9AC20AE748">
an Hypocrite, that though he be a <HI>Branch in Chri&s;t</HI>; that is to &s;ay, <HI>a Profe&s;&s;or</HI> of the true Chri&s;tian Religion, <HI>yet he bears no fruit,</HI> Joh. 15.1. And it is noted concerning tho&s;e un|&s;ound Profe&s;&s;ors, which proved Apo&s;tates at la&s;t, that they <HI>were unfruitful,</HI> Jude 12. Tho&s;e that have indeed an intere&s;t in Chri&s;t, are always fruitful; <HI>They that are married unto Chri&s;t, bring forth fruit unto God,</HI> Rom. 7.4. If therefore there be not a bringing forth of this fruit, that's a &s;ure &s;ign that the &s;oul was never married to Chri&s;t, never u|nited unto him by faith, never had a &s;aving intere&s;t in him. It may be &s;aid of every true Believer, as was &s;aid of <HI>One&s;imus,</HI> Phil. 11. <HI>In time pa&s;t unprofitable, but now profita|ble.</HI> So a &s;inner before his Conver&s;ion, is an unfruitful Creature; but when once he is effectually brought home to God, then he is profitable; If he be (as <HI>One&s;imus</HI> was) a &s;ervant, he is a profitable Servant; he la|bours to conform him&s;elf to the will of God and &s;o to plea&s;e God in every thing; whate|ver Relation he &s;tands in, he brings forth fruit according to that Relation, endeavour|ing to an&s;wer the duties of that Relation; never &s;ay or think that you are Chri&s;tians, if it be nor thus with you. Hence it is, that the Conver&s;ion of &s;inners is in the Scriptures &s;et forth by &s;aying, <HI>In&s;tead of the Thorn &s;hall come up the Firr-tree; and in&s;tead of the Bryer &s;hall come up the Mirtle-tree,</HI> I&s;a.

<P>Con&s;ider 2. <HI>That many hearers of the Word are altogether unprofitable.</HI> Yea, the mo&s;t by far are &s;o; &s;o we read in <HI>Mat.</HI> 13. concern|ing four &s;orts of ground, &amp; but one of them good; that is to &s;ay, four &s;orts of hearers of the Word, and there are three to one that are bad. Oh, how &s;hould this <HI>awaken!</HI> And alas, if we look into the World we &s;hall find, that indeed it is thus: As it was &s;aid of <HI>E|phraim,</HI> that he was an <HI>empty Vine,</HI> that bro't forth fruit unto him&s;elf; thus it is with ma|ny, yea, with the mo&s;t of men, nay of Pro|fe&s;&s;ors, they bring forth fruit to them&s;elves, to the World, to Satan, but not to God. How is it with many of you? you have leaves and that's all, even Profe&s;&s;ion without Practice; others of you, you bring forth the fruit of Morality and Civility, &amp; that's all; you ble&s;s your &s;elves that you are no Drun|kards, no Adulterers, no Swearers; but I be&s;eech you con&s;ider, Morality and Civility alone, is no &s;aving Evangelical work; you may have this, and yet fall &s;hort of that fruit which the Go&s;pel requireth: There are o|thers, that in&s;tead of good, they bring forth evil fruit, even <HI>Thorns</HI> and <HI>Bryers.</HI> Are there not lamentable Divi&s;ions and Contentions a|mong&s;t us? &s;uch fruit is, <HI>Thorns</HI> and <HI>Bryers.</HI>

Chri&s;t's voice is &s;poken of. When Chri&s;t's <HI>Voice,</HI> his Word is heard, then is he <HI>knock|ing</HI> at the hearts of men; therefore the Word is compared to an Hammer, <HI>Jer.</HI> 23.29. <HI>Is not my Word like an Hammer,</HI> &amp;c.

<HI>by the cords of a man,</HI> that is, by mercies &amp; loving kindne&s;&s;es, for tho&s;e are the cords of a man, even the cords which men are taken and drawn with. And thus al&s;o did the Lord &s;trive with the&s;e &s;inners of the Old World, which my Text &s;peaketh of, as you may &s;ee by that which <HI>Eliphas</HI> &s;peaketh, <HI>Job</HI> 22.15. <HI>to</HI> 19. <HI>Ha&s;t thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden, who&s;e foundations was overthrown with a flood, which &s;aid unto God, depart from us, &amp; what can the Almighty do to them, yet he filled their hou&s;es with good things.</HI> So that tho&s;e wick|ed men that were overthrown with the Hood, yet God filled their hou&s;es with good things, and thereby did he &s;trive with them, to &s;ee if kindne&s;s would break their hearts.

<P N="2">2. There are the <HI>Inward &s;trivings</HI> of Gods Spirit. All tho&s;e common operations of the Spirit, which &s;inners, yea, Reprobate &s;in|ners may be &s;ubject unto, are the &s;ecret ble&s;&s;ed &s;trivings of the holy Gho&s;t, with the

Souls of men. There is indeed an inward, powerful, effectual, &s;aving Operations of the Spirit upon the hearts of the Elect. I am not &s;peaking of <HI>that,</HI> but of com|mon works of the Spirit which &s;inners may partake of. To in&s;tance a little: 1. <HI>There are &s;ome &s;inners, that the holy Spirit doth greatly enlighten their minds.</HI> They have much knowledge in the things of God, they are made to under&s;tand what their duty is, even what they mu&s;t do, <HI>that</HI> &s;o they may plea&s;e God, and be made happy for ever, <HI>Mich.</HI> 6.8. <HI>He hath &s;hewed thee, O man, what is good; And what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do ju&s;tly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God.</HI> They could not plead ignorance of the mind of God, the Lord had taken care that they &s;hould be in&s;tructed, both in duties of the fir&s;t and &s;econd Table. Now all Conviction of duty is from the Spirit, yea, all <HI>Illumination</HI> in Divine things is from him; therefore the holy Gho&s;t is called, <HI>the Spirit of Truth,</HI> becau&s;e all truth and all di&s;covery of truth is from him. If a man be but enlightned, &s;o as to un|der&s;tand the Fundamental points in Reli|gion, this is a great work of Gods Spirit. Hence the Apo&s;tle &s;aith, <HI>No man &s;peaking by the Spirit of God, calls Je&s;us accur&s;ed; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> no man can &s;ay, that Je&s;us is the Lord, but by the holy Spirit,</HI> 1 Cor. 12.3.
<PB N="121" REF="002260_0145_0FDAE00247BAB2E0">
Becau&s;e if a man be but convinced, <HI>that</HI> Je|&s;us Chri&s;t is the true Me&s;&s;iah, even the Son of God, and <HI>Lord</HI> of all, this Conviction is however a common work of the holy Gho&s;t upon the mind. 2. <HI>The holy Gho&s;t may cau&s;e terror to be in the Con&s;cience of a &s;inner</HI>: That then is a &s;econd way how the Spirit doth &s;trive inwardly, it is he that doth <HI>convince the world of &s;in,</HI> Joh. 16.8. All Conviction of &s;in and mi&s;ery, is from the Spirit. Sometimes the holy Spirit cometh and rea&s;ons the ca&s;e with a poor &s;inner, till at la&s;t he is &s;ilenced by the Evidence and Demon&s;tration of the Spirit; from the <HI>which Convincements,</HI> &s;ecret, awful terrors do ari&s;e. Hence the Scripture &s;peaks of <HI>the Spirit of Bondage unto fear,</HI> Rom. 8.15. The holy Spirit convinceth a &s;inner that his pre&s;ent condition is mi&s;erable; &s;o as <HI>that</HI> if he doth not get out of it, he mu&s;t peri&s;h to all e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er|nity. Hence di&s;mal fears do ari&s;e in the Soul; the &s;inner crieth out in the horror of his heart, <HI>I am a damned Wretch for ever, if death &s;hould find me in this e&s;tate.</HI> Now the&s;e terrible awakenings of Con&s;cien<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> are the mighty &s;trivings of the Spirit. An in&s;tance we have of this in <HI>Felix,</HI> Acts 24.25. As <HI>Paul rea&s;oned of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Temperance &amp; Judgment, Felix trembled.</HI> This <HI>Felix</HI> had been a very unrighteous and intemperate man, and did at that time live in unclean|ne&s;s; and thence hearing <HI>Paul</HI> preach and

prove, <HI>that there is a Judgment to come,</HI> wherein all &s;uch &s;inners &s;hall be puni&s;hed, he even trembled. Terror and trembling &s;eized upon his guilty Con&s;cience, at the &s;ad thought of this. 3. <HI>The holy Spirit may &s;o work upon the heart of a &s;inner, as to cau&s;e &s;ome good affections to work within him.</HI> Many have &s;ome faint, languid de|&s;ires, &s;ome cold wi&s;hes and wouldings af|ter Grace and life, <HI>that</HI> yet never did ex|perience a &s;aving work of the Spirit upon them. Now the&s;e &s;weet affections and workings of heart after that which is good, are from the holy Gho&s;t. Thus we &s;ee in tho&s;e Jews, <HI>John</HI> 5.35. <HI>Lord</HI> (&s;ay they) <HI>give us evermore of this bread.</HI> When they heard of the bread of Life, even &s;uch Bread, <HI>that</HI> if a man eat, he &s;hall never dye, pre&s;ently their affections were &s;tir|red, and marvellou&s;ly taken for a while, but it la&s;ted not. So the &s;tony ground hearer, <HI>received the word with joy,</HI> Mat. 13.21. he was much affected with the &s;weet promi&s;es of the Go&s;pel, yet this la&s;ted not.

and earne&s;t</HI> workings of heart towards God, when the good fit was upon them, but all died away, and came to nothing at la&s;t. Yea, even <HI>Balaam</HI> him&s;elf had his good affections and good wi&s;hes when time was, Numb. 23.10. <HI>Let me dye the death of the righteous; let my la&s;t end be like his.</HI> Bala|am in a good pang, could wi&s;h him&s;elf in the condition that righteous men are in: Many there are that have &s;uch <HI>Balaamitical fla&s;hes.</HI> 4. <HI>The holy Spirit may &s;o far &s;trive with a &s;inner, as to &s;tir up good purpo&s;es and re&s;olutions of Soul, to be, and to do better.</HI> As we &s;ee by them, <HI>Jer.</HI> 2.20. <HI>Thou &s;aid&s;t, I will not tran&s;gre&s;s, when,</HI> &amp;c: They pur|po&s;ed and promi&s;ed, that they would no more commit &s;uch and &s;uch &s;ins, yet when the Temptation came, they committed tho&s;e very &s;ins, which they had re&s;olved again&s;t. Now good purpo&s;es are from the holy Spi|rit. As evil purpo&s;es are from Satan, &s;o good purpo&s;es are from God; and u&s;ually it is &s;o, that if God &s;trive outwardly by his Word or Works, he doth al&s;o &s;trive inward|ly, by cau&s;ing Convictions, Terrors, good Affections and Re&s;olutions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This we &s;ee in them, P&s;al. 78 34. to 38. <HI>When he &s;lew them, then they &s;ought him, they enquired ear|ly after God, neverthele&s;s they did flatter him with their mouth, and lied unto him with their tongue; for their heart was not right with him, neither were they &s;tedfa&s;t in his Cove|nant.</HI>
<PB N="124" REF="002260_0148_0FDADFFDCD0DF310">
How common is it for &s;inners in their di&s;tre&s;s to purpo&s;e, and to promi&s;e better obedience, when &s;ickne&s;s is upon <HI>them,</HI> when they &s;ee Death and Eternity before their Eyes, when they &s;ee Hell gaping for them, and Devils ready to &s;eize upon their guilty &s;ouls; then Oh, if God will but &s;pare them this once, it &s;hall be &s;een how holy they will be; &amp; yet if the Lord doth deliver them, they are as bad or wor&s;e than ever they were, forgetting that the vows of God are upon them.</P>
<P>We come therefore in the &s;econd place, <HI>to &s;hew that the Spirit of God may cea&s;e &s;tri|ving with men.</HI> This is expre&s;&s;ed here in the Text, where God &s;aith, <HI>My Spirit &s;hall not &s;trive always.</HI> Now we mu&s;t not think, that this was a thing peculiar unto tho&s;e times of the old World only.

<P>Here con&s;ider a few things:</P>
<P>Con&s;ider. 1. <HI>That Gods Spirit will not always strive</HI>: Oh let the&s;e words &s;ound in thy ears, <HI>The Spirit of the Lord will not always &s;trive.</HI> Nay it may be, he will <HI>&s;trive no longer</HI>; Who knoweth, but that thy <HI>day</HI> may at this <HI>hour be</HI> &s;hutting upon thee?

to rest upon thee.</HI> God hath been purging of thee, and thou wa&s;t not purged; that is to &s;ay, he hath been u&s;ing means, and &s;triv|ing with thee, that &s;o thy Soul might be converted, and yet thou remaine&s;t a Carnal Creature &s;till: Fear le&s;t God &s;hould &s;ay, <HI>Thou &s;halt not be purged any more</HI>; thou &s;halt not have my Spirit to &s;trive with thee any <HI>longer.</HI></P>
<P>Con&s;ider. 2. <HI>That if it &s;hould be &s;o, that Gods Spirit &s;hould cea&s;e striving with thee, thou art then utterly undone forever</HI>: For when the Lord doth cea&s;e &s;triving with men, he doth <HI>even &s;wear in his wrath</HI> again&s;t them, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 95.11. <HI>&V;nto whom I &s;ware in my wrath, [if] they enter into my re&s;t.</HI> Saith the Lord, [if] tho&s;e &s;inners <HI>enter</HI> into re&s;t, then let me not be accounted God any longer: Oh thou &s;inful Creature, if the Lord &s;hould be provoked <HI>in his wrath to &s;wear</HI> again&s;t thee, then as &s;ure as God is God thou &s;halt be damned. A man may &s;ay a thing, and yet po&s;&s;ibly go back, but if he &s;wear, he will not go from his word: So the Lord &s;peaking after the manner of men, is &s;aid to &s;wear again&s;t &s;ome &s;inners, to &s;hew his unalterable De|termination again&s;t them, <HI>when he hath &s;worn, he will not repent,</HI> P&s;al. 110.4.

&s;hould for ever cea&s;e &s;triving with thee; and then no Prayers, nor Crys, nor Tears will avail for mercy. There is a Scripture, which methinks &s;hould &s;trike cold to the heart of many an unconverted &s;inner that hears me this day; it is that in the fir&s;t Chapter of the <HI>Proverbs,</HI> and the 28 Ver&s;e, <HI>Then &s;hall they call upon me, but I will not an&s;wer; they &s;hall &s;eek me early, but they &s;hall not find me.</HI> This was fulfilled upon the Jews, therefore did Chri&s;t &s;ay to them, <HI>Ye &s;hall &s;eek me, and &s;hall dye in your &s;ins: whither I go you cannot come,</HI> John 8.21. Alas, they did not come till the door of Mercy was &s;hut upon them. Had they &s;ought God <HI>early in the morning,</HI> they might have found him, <HI>Pro.</HI> 8.17.

But then it was too late, and therefore all crys were in vain. Re|member al&s;o how it was with the Children of <HI>I&s;rael, Deut.</HI> 1.45. <HI>Ye returned and wept before the Lord, but the Lord would not heark|en to your voice, nor give ear unto you.</HI> They

would not when they might, and therefore when they would, God &s;aid them nay. God commanded them to enter into <HI>Canaan,</HI> but they refu&s;ed; afterwards they would gladly have done it, but then it was too late: Though they prayed and wept, yet they had &s;inned away the offer of Grace, and the Lord was then become <HI>inexorable.</HI> Thus if men come after the day of Grace is over, though they &s;hould weep Seas of tears of blood, all would be in vain; <HI>for time is gone then.</HI> <Q>As I remember I have &s;ome-where read of a woman that had been guilty of Adultery, and it plea&s;ed God to terrifie her Con&s;cience, and then &s;he cryed out, <HI>Oh time is gone!</HI> and many Mini&s;ters were &s;ent for, to &s;ee if they could apply any word of Comfort, but &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ill &s;he cryed out, <HI>Time is gone</HI>! what tell you me of Prayer, <HI>my time is gone</HI>! what tell you me of Re|pentance and Pardon, <HI>my time is gone!</HI> what tell me of Faith in Chri&s;t, and Salvation by him, <HI>Oh my time is gone</HI>!</Q></P>
<P>Con&s;ider. 3. <HI>That whilst the Spirit of God doth continue striving, there is a day of Grace vouch&s;afed to you.</HI> Some poor Soul that trembleth at the Word of God, is ready to &s;ay, Alas, this is my doleful ca&s;e, I fear my

<P>THE u&s;ual method ob&s;erved by the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> in his Epi&s;tles, is, fir&s;t to di&s;cour&s;e Doctrinally, and then Practically; and &s;o he doth in this

Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Colo&s;&s;ians.</HI> The two fir&s;t Chapters are Doctrinal, and the two la&s;t are practical.</P>
<P>This Chapter then doth contain matter of Exhortation unto duty. 1. We have a &s;pe|cial <HI>Oeconomical</HI> Precept, even a rule concer|ning Hou&s;hold-Government, (which in the former Chapter the Apo&s;tle had been &s;peak|ing of,) <HI>ver&s;.</HI> 1.2. He lays down &s;undry <HI>general Moral Precepts,</HI> which concern Chri&s;|tians, in whatever &s;tate or relation they may &s;tand in.</P>
<P>And here the Apo&s;tle doth exhort. 1. To the practice of <HI>that</HI> great duty of prayer, <HI>ver.</HI> 2. and in &s;pecial <HI>that</HI> they would pray for him, <HI>ver&s;e</HI> 3, 4.2. He exhorts unto Chri&s;tian Wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>And <HI>that</HI> is the &s;cope of this ver&s;e, in <HI>which we</HI> have three things: 1. The duty exhorted unto, namely, Wi&s;e Walking, <HI>Walk in Wi&s;|dom,</HI> that is, cautelou&s;ly and circum&s;pectly, as it is expre&s;&s;ed by the &s;ame Apo&s;tle, wri|ting to the <HI>Ephe&s;ians,</HI> ch. 5. ver. 16.2. We have the object of this duty, <HI>towards them that are without,</HI> that is Infidels, who are out of the Pale of the vi&s;ible Church. The Church is compared to an Hou&s;e, hence they <HI>that</HI> are of the Church, are &s;aid to be <HI>with|in,</HI> that is, within doors, in re&s;pect of that &s;acred Hou&s;e of the Church; and them that do not belong to the vi&s;ible Church, are de|&s;cribed to be <HI>without,</HI> that is, they are not admitted
<PB N="148" REF="002260_0172_0FDAE05D1665E300">
within doors, but are kept out of the Temple.</P>
<P N="3">3. Here is that which is the &s;pecial work and evidence of this Wi&s;dom, namely, to <HI>re|deem the time,</HI> which are the words, that by Gods help, we are to &s;peak of.</P>
<P><HI>Time</HI> is &s;ometimes taken for &s;pace of time.

<P>The <HI>Doctrine</HI> which the words do af|ford unto us, is this;
<Q>That it is a great part of Chri&s;tian Wi&s;dom, timely to improve Opportunities and Sea|&s;ons of Grace.</Q></P>
<P>Intending to di&s;patch the point at this time, we &s;hall in the Doctrinal pro&s;ecuti|on of it, only &s;peak to two things, 1. What tho&s;e &s;ea&s;ons are which ought to be im|proved. 2. What is implied in redeem|ing &s;ea&s;ons of Grace; or when a man may be &s;aid to redeem the time.</P>
<P>Que&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. 1. <HI>What are tho&s;e &s;ea&s;ons which ought to be improved</HI>?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> 1. <HI>A mans life-time in this World is to be improved.</HI> Thus Chri&s;t hath taught
<PB N="149" REF="002260_0173_0FDAE02589070130">
us by his own <HI>unerring example,</HI> John 9.4. <HI>I mu&s;t work while it is day, the night cometh when no man can work.</HI> A mans life is but a &s;ea&s;on, even a day which &s;hall have a night follow it; and therefore it is to be improved: Yea, and it is but a &s;hort &s;ea&s;on, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7.30. <HI>The time is &s;hort.</HI> He that hath longe&s;t to live, yet hath but a &s;hort time to be in this World; therefore <HI>James</HI> &s;aith, <HI>What is your life? it is even a vapour that appeareth for a lit|tle time, and then vani&s;heth away,</HI> chap. 4. <HI>ver&s;.</HI> 14. and <HI>David</HI> &s;aith, <HI>Behold thou ha&s;t made my days an hand breadth, and mine age is as nothing before thee,</HI> P&s;al. 39.5. A mans time in this World is as nothing before God, that is to &s;ay, as nothing in compari&s;on of Eternity; therefore this time ought &s;o much the more carefully &amp; diligently to be improved; and it may be a mans time is much &s;horter than him|&s;elf doth think for. We read of one in the Go&s;pel that was to fooli&s;h, as to dream of many years, when as he had not &s;o much as one day to live: He &s;aid he had goods for many, not only days, but years, when as before this next day, his Soul was taken from him, <HI>Luke</HI> 12.20. Be&s;ides, when a mans life is once gone, it is irrecove|rable, men mu&s;t dye, and out of this World they &s;hall go, and yet they <HI>dye but once,</HI> Heb. 9.27. <HI>It is appointed for men</HI> [once]
<PB N="150" REF="002260_0174_0FDAE05E888FA680">
<HI>to dye:</HI> When once men are dead, <HI>the places that have known them, &s;hall know them no more; the eyes that have &s;een them, &s;hall &s;ee them no more; and the ears that have heard them, &s;hall hear them no more.</HI> And thence if men do not improve their time whil&s;t they are alive in the World, they lo&s;e their &s;ea|&s;on for ever. When death is come, it is then too late to improve time; therefore <HI>Hezekiah</HI> &s;aith, <HI>They that go down into the pit. cannot hope for thy truth,</HI> I&s;a 38 18. When a mans body is gone down into the pit of the grave, and his &s;oul is gone down into the pit of Hell, he is pa&s;t hope, &amp; pa&s;t help; he cannot hope for Gods mercy, he cannot hope for pardon of &s;in, he cannot hope for the &s;alvation of his &s;oul. There|fore life-time is to be improved.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Time &s;et apart for the &s;olemn Wor&s;hip of God, are carefully to be improved.</HI> Chri&s;ti|ans ought to redeem time from their particu|lar, to attend the duties of their general Cal|ling; they ought not to &s;erve them&s;elves only, but they mu&s;t look to it, that they allow them&s;elves time al&s;o for the &s;ervice of God. It is true, that &s;ome are &s;o much in the outward performance of religious du|ties, as that they do thereby intrench upon their particular callings, &s;pending more time in outward Wor&s;hip, than any rule of God doth require, or allow them to do: So the <HI>Heretical Euchites</HI> of old, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But the great|e&s;t
<PB N="151" REF="002260_0175_0FDAE0270E15F118">
part of men err on the other hand, in allowing too little time, rather than too much, for the performance of &s;acred duties. But it is a great point of Chri&s;tian wi&s;dom, to order things aright about this matter; &s;o as that neither a mans particular calling may intrench upon his general calling as a Chri&s;tian, nor yet his general upon the par|ticular. I &s;ay, that time mu&s;t be allowed for the Wor&s;hip of God. A man may not neglect the Wor&s;hip of God, either in his Family, or in his Clo&s;et, or in the publick A&s;&s;emblies of his people, out of pretence <HI>that</HI> he wants time; rather let a man deny him&s;elf time to &s;leep, nay time to eat and drink, than not to take time to pray, and to &s;erve God. Moreover, when a man is wor&s;hipping God in any duty, &s;uch a &s;ea&s;on is very heedfully to be improved, el&s;e the Lords name will be taken in vain; and men in&s;tead of &s;erving and plea&s;ing God, will provoke him to di&s;plea&s;ure by an heedle&s;s &s;erving of him. And in &s;pecial, the Lords Day is a &s;ea&s;on of Grace which ought to be improved, that's the day appointed to &s;o|lemnize the Name and Wor&s;hip of God in Chri&s;t among&s;t men, to the end of the World, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 118 24. <HI>This is the day which the Lord hath made, we will rejoyce in it:</HI> The day of Chri&s;ts Re&s;urrection, which was upon the fir&s;t-day of the week, even this very day is to be ob&s;erved, in Commemora|tion
<PB N="152" REF="002260_0176_0FDAE0600E343B00">
of the Re&s;urrection and Redemption of Chri&s;t: <HI>This is the day,</HI> which above o|thers, ought to be prized and improved: It is a Market-day for the Soul, and therefore to be redeemed. Be&s;ides, if men take hold of opportunities, to attend there where God is wor&s;hipped, they come where the Lord him&s;elf cometh, and thence may hope for a ble&s;&s;ing: In which re&s;pect &s;uch &s;ea&s;ons &s;hould earne&s;tly be laid hold on. You read in the fifth of <HI>John,</HI> concerning an impotent man that lay waiting at the Pools of <HI>Bethe&s;|da,</HI> and Chri&s;t finding him there, he was healed. Had not the man layen at the Pools of <HI>Bethe&s;da,</HI> Chri&s;t had not found him there, and had not Chri&s;t found him there, he had not been healed. Now the Ordinances of God are the Pools of <HI>Bethe&s;da</HI>; if Chri&s;t find men there, who knoweth but that Grace and Life may be given into their &s;ouls; but if they be not there, they keep them&s;elves out of the way of a ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The time of pro&s;perity is a &s;ea&s;on which ought to be well improve.</HI> Thus you find <HI>David</HI> calling upon the Princes of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> 1 Chron. 22.11, 18, 19. <HI>Is not the Lord your God with you? hath he not given you re&s;t on every &s;ide? now &s;et your heart and your &s;oul to &s;eek the Lord your God.</HI> It is (&s;aith he) a pro&s;|perous &s;ea&s;on with you, and therefore now be looking after God, &amp; the things of God; and indeed this is the mo&s;t commodious &s;ea|&s;on.
<PB N="153" REF="002260_0177_0FDAE028A4F906E0">
Husbandmen you know will take the &s;ea&s;on whil&s;t the Sun &s;hineth, and the wea|ther is favourable, to be gathering in the fruits of the earth: So if men would be laying in for Eternity, if they would be lay|ing up in &s;tore for them&s;elves a good foun|dation again&s;t the time to come, <HI>that</HI> they may lay hold of Eternal Life, it will be their wi&s;dom to improve the time of pro&s;|perity in order thereunto. As now, if God give unto a man a time of health &amp; &s;trength, let him improve it, in order to making his peace with God, and promoting the Eternal welfare of his own Soul. Thus the Holy Gho&s;t by <HI>Solomon</HI> doth exhort, Eccle&s;. 12.1. <HI>Re|member thy Creator</HI>; Ay, but when? When old age cometh, or when &s;ickne&s;s or death cometh, but never before <HI>that</HI>; to the Car|nal heart &s;aith, and &s;o the Devil &s;aith, but the Lord teacheth otherwi&s;e; therefore it is added, <HI>In the days of thy youth, while the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou &s;halt &s;ay, I have no plea&s;ure in them.</HI> The evil days of &s;ickne&s;s, or the trouble&s;ome years of old age will come up|on you; but &s;ee <HI>that</HI> you remember to make your <HI>peace with God,</HI> before tho&s;e days come.

<P>THe&s;e words are part of that large and ble&s;&s;ed Sermon which Chri&s;t preached on the Mount; the <HI>whole Sermon</HI> is full of Heavenly matter.

Thus it is with men, they are all Travelling to another World, they are all walking towards Eternity, but in contra|ry ways: Some are going towards Eternal

Life; others are going towards Eternal Death. Wherefore Chri&s;ts &s;cope in the&s;e Ver&s;es, is, to per&s;wade men to enter in at the Strait Gate, and to walk in the Nar|row way.</P>
<P>Divers Arguments are u&s;ed to pre&s;s this Exhortation, both with reference unto the Broad, and al&s;o with reference unto the Narrow Way. As for the Broad Way, one Argument there mentioned is, that it is a common thing to walk therein, <HI>Many there are that walk therein</HI>; and therefore there is &s;o much more need to be careful about the matter. Again, becau&s;e of the mi&s;erable end which that way doth bring unto, <HI>It leads unto de&s;truction:</HI> That's the end and i&s;&s;ue of walking in the Broad Way; there|fore we &s;hould be &s;ure to walk in the Nar|row Way. And then in reference to the Narrow Way it &s;elf, there are divers <HI>Ar|gument<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tive Con&s;iderations</HI> mentioned; 1.

many thou&s;ands, yea, million of them, even a numberle&s;s number, like the <HI>&s;tars of Heaven.</HI> But this is to be un|der&s;tood <HI>comparatively</HI>; the number of tho&s;e that walk in the way to life is but &s;mall, compared with the other number, namely, in re&s;pect of tho&s;e that &s;hall mi&s;s of Eternal Life. The Doctrine therefore which may be in&s;i&s;ted on from the words, is this.</P>
<P>Doctr. <HI>That the number of tho&s;e that walk in the way which leads to Eternal Life, being compared with tho&s;e that are in the way to De&s;truction, is but a very &s;mall number.</HI></P>
<P>In the Doctrinal pro&s;ecution of this point, three things may be attended. 1. To &s;hew what is that way of Life which is here &s;poken of. 2. How it doth appear that but few &s;hall find Eternal Life. 3. Whence it cometh to pa&s;s, that &s;o few do find E|ternal Life.</P>
<P>Que&s;t. 1. <HI>What is the way to life</HI>?</P>

of God, then he is in the way of life. This way is laid out by Rule, and that Rule is none other but the Word of Truth. Hence it is called, <HI>The Way of God,</HI> and the <HI>way of the Lord</HI>; that is to &s;ay, the way which the Lord hath appointed men to walk in, that &s;o they may be &s;aved. Particularly,</P>
<P N="1">1. In this way <HI>Repentance and &s;ound Con|ver&s;ion unto God</HI> is implied. For men by Nature are out of the right way, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.12.

Never any man did obtain Eternal Life, but it was in this way, even in a way of believ|ing on Chri&s;t; and never any man did mi&s;s of Eternal Life, that did indeed walk in the way of Faith. 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 5.12. <HI>He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.</HI> Who&s;o findeth Chri&s;t, finds the way to Eternal Life.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The way of new and holy obedience</HI> un|to God in Chri&s;t, is the way of life; There|fore the Scripture &s;peaks of the <HI>holy way,</HI> I&s;a. 35.8 <HI>And a way &s;hall be there, and it &s;hall be called the way of holine&s;s, the unclean &s;hall not pa&s;s over it.</HI> Now this Holine&s;s is the way to life, Prov. 12.28. <HI>In the way of Rigteou&s;ne&s;s is life, and in the path-way there|of is no death.</HI> If a man doth walk in righ|teous paths, and keep in righteous holy ways, no Eternal death &s;hall take hold of him, but this way will lead him unto life. This which hath been expre&s;&s;ed, is the only way to life and glory; this way hath ever been the &s;ame in all ages of the World.

<P>We come then unto the &s;econd thing, that is, to enquire, <HI>How it doth appear, that the number of tho&s;e that find the way to life is comparatively but a &s;mall number</HI>?</P>
<P>Now for An&s;wer unto that Enquiry, &s;eve|ral things may be mentioned, which are E|vidences and clear Demon&s;trations of the truth of this point.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Becau&s;e tho&s;e that do enjoy the Word and outward means of Grace, are comparatively but few.</HI> God hath appointed the means &amp; the end to go together; therefore where he intends that end of Eternal Life, he is wont to be&s;tow the means which him&s;elf hath ap|pointed, in order to the attainment of that end; Hence is that, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2.4. <HI>God will have all men</HI> (that is to &s;ay, men of all &s;orts, as the Context doth manife&s;t) <HI>to be &s;aved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth</HI>; tho&s;e two go together, even <HI>Salvation</HI> and the knowledge of the Truth.

which plainly declares, that without Prea|ching (according to ordinary Di&s;pen&s;ati|on) there is no Salvation This is cer|tain, that there is no Salvation without Chri&s;t, <HI>Acts</HI> 4.12. It was <HI>Au&s;tin</HI>'s &s;aying, that <HI>he that doth think that one may be &s;aved without Chri&s;t, it may well be que&s;ti|oned whether that man &s;hall him&s;elf be &s;a|ved or no.</HI> And there is no Salvation by Chri&s;t, without Faith in him: <HI>This is Life Eternal to know</HI> (that is, to believe on) <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> John 17.3.

<P>But the truth hereof will be further evi|dent, by &s;peaking to the third thing pro|pounded for the opening of the point; that is, <HI>Whence it cometh to pa&s;s that &s;o few do walk in the way of life?</HI> We &s;hall only mention two <HI>Rea&s;ons</HI> of the Doctrine.</P>
<P><HI>Rea&s;.</HI> 1. Becau&s;e <HI>the way of life doth not &s;uit with Nature.</HI> There mu&s;t be a Super|natural light to direct the Soul into this way, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.14. <HI>The natural man receiv|eth not the things of God, neither can he know them.</HI> And after a man doth &s;ee this way, there mu&s;t be a Supernatural work of the Spirit to cau&s;e him to venture on in it; yea, it is not only <HI>above</HI> nature, but <HI>again&s;t</HI> corrupt nature. The way of Mortification, is the way to Heaven. Now that's a way to which men are naturally as aver&s;e unto, as they are to cut off their right hand, or to pluck out a right eye, <HI>Mat.</HI> 5.29. If this be &s;o, no wonder that &s;o few are found walking in this narrow way. To &s;ee men
<PB N="189" REF="002260_0213_0FDAE0AA4470CB88">
&s;wimming down the &s;tream is no &s;trange thing, for that's natural; but to &s;ee them &s;wimming again&s;t the &s;tream, would be wonderful. Thus it is here, when men walk in the way to life, they &s;wim a|gain&s;t the &s;tream. Hence we need not marvel if there be but few &s;uch. And this is further manife&s;t, becau&s;e,</P>
<P>Rea&s;. 2. <HI>The way to life is an hard way,</HI> even a way full of Afflictions and Temp|tations on the right hand and on the left; hence Chri&s;t calls it a <HI>narrow way,</HI> or an <HI>afflicted</HI> way, as the word intimateth, a <HI>compre&s;&s;ed way,</HI> as &s;ome render it: Things that are <HI>dilated by pre&s;&s;ure,</HI> are made <HI>nar|row</HI>; &s;o is this way which you hear of, <HI>The way to the Kingdom of God is through many tribulations,</HI> Acts 14.22. It's like the way out of <HI>Egypt</HI> to <HI>Canaan,</HI> there was a di&s;mal de&s;olate Wilderne&s;s in the way, which was a Land of drought, and of pits, and of fiery flying Serpents, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> So is the way to the heavenly <HI>Canaan</HI> no le&s;s terrible. Thence there are but <HI>few that find it.</HI></P>
<P>Thus you &s;ee the Truth cleared and pro|ved from Scripture.</P>
<P>But &s;ome one will &s;ay, <HI>Doth not God delight more in glorifying his Grace, that in manife&s;ting the dreadfulne&s;s of his Ju&s;tice? How then can there more be damned than &s;aved</HI>?</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="002260_0214_0FDAE0720AB2A1D8"><HI>An&s;w.</HI> True, but Grace is glorified more in the life of a few, than Ju&s;tice in the De|&s;truction of tho&s;e many millions of millions that &s;hall peri&s;h. The rea&s;on is, Becau&s;e all men have de&s;erved death, but none have de&s;erved life. And as for tho&s;e that &s;hall be &s;aved, becau&s;e they are but few, therefore Grace is the more magnified towards them, and will be glorified in them, and by them to all Eternity.</P>
<P>We come then to apply this truth.</P>
<P>&V;&s;e. 1. By way of <HI>Confutation:</HI> This Doctrine lets us &s;ee the erroneou&s;ne&s;s of &s;udry fal&s;e Opinions which &s;ome men have taken up. As,</P>
<P N="1">1. Their Opinion is from hence convin|ced of error, <HI>who have thought that the Gentiles were &s;aved by their Phylo&s;ophy and Morality,</HI> though they had nothing but the light of Nature to in&s;truct them. If that were &s;o, Chri&s;t would never have &s;aid con|cerning the way to life, <HI>few there be that find it.</HI> How can that be, if very Heathens by the dark light of nature find it? One of the Ancients therefore &s;aid well, <HI>That &s;ome have endeavoured to prove</HI> Plato a <HI>Chri&s;tian, till they have thereby proved them&s;elves to be little better than Heathens.</HI> There is a Book extant with that Title, <HI>de Salute</HI> Ari&s;tote|lis, <HI>concerning the Salvation of</HI> Ari&s;totle. And an other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ath written a Book, <HI>de Ani|mabus Paganorum,</HI> endeavouring to prove,
<PB N="191" REF="002260_0215_0FDAE0ABD7C88040">
that the Souls of &s;ome <HI>that</HI> dyed Pagans, are in a &s;tate of bli&s;s. But tho' I cen|&s;ure not any of the godly, learned Anci|ents, or among&s;t the Reformers, that have been blemi&s;h'd with this error, yet it will be found certain another day, That <HI>Philo&s;ophy</HI> without <HI>Theology</HI>; light of Na|ture without the light of Scripture, will never bring <HI>the</HI> Soul to Chri&s;t, or into <HI>that</HI> way which leads to Eternal life. There are <HI>too</HI> many bad <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> but there are no good <HI>Heathens.</HI> Take the be&s;t of the Gen|tiles, even tho&s;e <HI>that</HI> wrote mo&s;t for Ver|tue, and try them by the Touch-&s;tone of Gods Word, and it will be found true, <HI>that</HI> there never was the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;t real Scripture-ver|tue in any of them.

Then Magnanimity, if tryed by Scripture, will be found no <HI>better than that</HI> odious and accur&s;ed &s;in of Pride. What &s;hall we &s;ay, <HI>that Paul</HI> doth expre&s;ly and by name con|demn <HI>that</HI> for a Vice, which <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> cry|eth up for a Vertue. So you find, <HI>Ephe&s;.</HI> 5.4. the Apo&s;tle <HI>there</HI> doth condemn <HI>Je&s;ting,</HI> the Greek word ENTRAPELIA, which is one of <HI>Ari&s;totles</HI> Vertues. Yet it mu&s;t be acknowledged, <HI>that</HI> the Morality of the

Gentiles was not altogether lo&s;t to them; for (as &s;ome have well ob&s;erved) they thereby procured Temporal good to them|&s;elves, and pre&s;ent ea&s;e of Con&s;cience, yea, and le&s;s mi&s;ery in Hell <HI>than otherwi&s;e</HI> they mu&s;t have &s;uffered. But as to Eternal Life, all <HI>the&s;e things without</HI> Chri&s;t, were of no value.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>This Doctrine al&s;o confuteth the Error of &V;niver&s;al Redemption.</HI> Certainly if Chri&s;t had dyed for all, he would never him&s;elf affirm, <HI>that but few &s;hall find the way to Eternal Life.</HI> If Chri&s;t have died <HI>to</HI> &s;ave men, and <HI>yet they</HI> fall &s;hort of <HI>Salvation,</HI> then mu&s;t his blood be &s;hed in vain, as <HI>not</HI> being able <HI>to</HI> accompli&s;h <HI>the</HI> end intended by him, which <HI>thing</HI> may <HI>not</HI> be imagined, <HI>Gal.</HI> 2.21.

<P>Doct. 2. <HI>That Chri&s;tians ought to work out their own Salvation, even with fear and trembling.</HI></P>
<P>To begin with the fir&s;t of the&s;e Doc|trines, namely, <HI>That men ought to work out their own Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>In the Doctrinal pro&s;ecution of this point, we &s;hall only attend two things: 1. To &s;hew what is implied in working out
<PB N="212" REF="002260_0236_0FDAE08A4C132020">
our own Salvation. 2. The Rea&s;on of this point.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>What is implied in working out our own Salvation</HI>; or, <HI>When may a man be &s;aid &s;o to do</HI>?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> We mu&s;t know <HI>Negatively,</HI> that herein is not implied, as though men had power to &s;ave them&s;elves. Men are able to de&s;troy them&s;elves; and that's all they can now do of them&s;elves, <HI>Ho&s;.</HI> 13.9. <HI>Thou ha&s;t destroyed thy &s;elf, O I&s;rael.</HI> There is a <HI>Self-de&s;truction</HI> which every man is &s;ubject unto; but there is no <HI>Self-&s;alvation.</HI> Herein is the difference between man in his fir&s;t, and in his fallen e&s;tate: <HI>Adam</HI> was able to do and live, had he improved the ability which at fir&s;t God be&s;towed on him; but &s;ince the fall none can do &s;o: It is therefore given as the de&s;cription of a man in his natural condition, that he is <HI>without strength,</HI> Rom. 5.6. A man by nature, hath no &s;piritual &s;trength for the performance of the thing that good is; nay, a natural man cannot &s;o much as de&s;ire that which is good, much le&s;s can he perform it: Therefore in the next Ver&s;e to the Text, the Apo&s;tle &s;aith, <HI>That it is God that worketh both to will and to do, of his own good plea&s;ure.</HI> So that a man cannot <HI>will,</HI> he cannot <HI>de&s;ire,</HI> much le&s;s <HI>do,</HI> that which is truly good, except Divine,

Supernatral help be afforded to him. And therefore though the Apo&s;tle &s;ay, <HI>Work out your Salvation,</HI> his meaning is not, as though men were able to &s;ave them&s;elves: Nor in his meaning, as though men could by their works merit Salvation. In a meritorious work, there mu&s;t be &s;ome proporti|on between the work, and thing merit|ed thereby; whereas there is no proporti|on between our Works and Salvation, Rom. 8.18. <HI>I reckon</HI> (&s;aith the Apo&s;tle) <HI>that the &s;ufferings of this pre&s;ent life, are not wor|thy to be compared with the glory which &s;hall be revealed.</HI> Suffering-work is hard work-pa&s;&s;ive obedience, is the harde&s;t and highe&s;t obedi|ence, therefore if a man could merit by any thing, it would be by &s;uffering, when as we &s;ee there is no proportion between our &s;uffrings &amp; the reward. Be&s;ides, to be &s;aved by Works, is contrary to being &s;aved by Grace: Works and Grace are in the matter of Salvation, as oppo&s;ite as two things can be: <HI>If it is of Works, it is not of Grace</HI> (&s;aith the Scripture) <HI>Rom.</HI> 4.4. &amp; 11.6. But we are &s;aved by Grace, <HI>Ephe&s;.</HI> 2.8. <HI>By Grace are ye &s;aved, and not of your &s;elves, it is the gift of God.</HI> In a word, to merit is none of our work, it is Chri&s;ts work: Though God calls us to work out our Salvation, yet not

God. The Lord doth not be&s;tow Grace (nor gifts) upon men, that &s;o they &s;hould let them lie by them idle; but that &s;o they might improve what they have received, &s;o as &s;hall make mo&s;t for the honour and inter|e&s;t of him that gave it, and thereby to pro|mote their own Salvation. As the not im|proving of Talents, is the way to mi&s;s of Salvation, as we &s;ee in the Parable of the Talents, <HI>Mat.</HI> 25. <HI>Adam</HI> had a large &s;tock of Grace conferred upon him, the &s;tock of all the World was put into his hands, but he improved it not, and thence lo&s;t the life of him&s;elf, and all his Po&s;terity. So the im|provement of Talents is the way to further Salvation; yea, the truth is, that the more any man doth exerci&s;e Grace, the more Sal|vation &s;hall he have: Degrees of Glory in Heaven, will be according to Improvements of Grace upon earth; therefore the Apo&s;tle &s;aith, <HI>He that &s;oweth &s;paringly, &s;hall reap &s;pa|ringly; and he that &s;oweth bountifully, &s;hall reap bountifully,</HI> 2 Cor. 9.6. and Chri&s;t &s;aith <HI>that who&s;oever hath, to him &s;hall be given, and he &s;hall have more abundance,</HI> Mat. 13.12. <HI>He that hath</HI>; that is, he that improveth the Grace which he hath received; for not to u&s;e a thing, is as if a man had it not; So [<HI>to have</HI>] is to <HI>improve</HI> what a man hath; &s;uch a one &s;hall have much Grace here, and much Glory hereafter.

glory to God; therefore Chri&s;t &s;aid to the Di&s;ciples, <HI>Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit,</HI> John 15.8. It's a greater glory to God for a poor Soul to act faith upon him, or to exerci&s;e love towards him, than all the Creatures in the World that have not Grace are able to bring unto him.

<P N="5">5. Herein is implied, that decays in grace be repaired.

You &s;hall, &s;aith he, hold on in your Chri&s;tian cour&s;e, till you come to the end of your race, <HI>and &s;hall never fall by the way,</HI> that is, not <HI>irrecoverably.</HI> Yet it is &s;adly true, that there may be gradual de|cays, though that &s;tock of Grace which God be&s;toweth upon the Soul in its fir&s;t Cover&s;i|on cannot be lo&s;t; yet a gracious Chri&s;tian may be, as it were, in a &s;wooning fit &s;ome|times. The <HI>wi&s;e Virgins &s;lept.</HI> The lively and vigorous actings of Grace may decay yea, a man may decay in Knowledge, in Love, in Practice, that <HI>po&s;&s;ibly</HI> he doth not <HI>pray</HI> &s;o often as formerly, nor hear &s;o diligently nor keep &s;uch a &s;trict watch over his own heart, nor is &s;o <HI>heavenly</HI> minded, nor &s;o
<PB N="221" REF="002260_0245_0FDAE0CD8F1BB0E8">
zealous for God as once he was. A true Chri&s;tian, if he be not <HI>very</HI> watchful, will be &s;ubject to not only <HI>actual,</HI> but <HI>even habi|tual declen&s;ions</HI>; As we &s;ee in the Chri&s;tians at <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> who had not only lo&s;t their <HI>fir&s;t works,</HI> there was actual declen&s;ions; but their <HI>fir&s;t love al&s;o,</HI> there was inward and habitual declen&s;ion, <HI>Rev.</HI> 2.5.

As it was &s;aid to back&s;liding <HI>Sardis, Repent, &s;trengthen the things which re|main, and are ready to dye, Rev.</HI> 3.2, 3. So as for decaying, dying, langui&s;hing Chri&s;ti|ans, the things which concern them, is to repent, and to &s;eek after renewing Grace. As <HI>David</HI> in &s;uch a ca&s;e did, P&s;al. 51.10. <HI>Renew a right &s;pirit within me,</HI> and again, Ver&s;. 12. <HI>Re&s;tore unto me the joy of thy Sal|vation.</HI> This is nece&s;&s;ary in order to work|ing out <HI>Salvation.</HI> If a man be going to &s;uch a place, and turn out of his way, if ever he would come to his journeys end, he mu&s;t return into his way again.

<P N="6">6. <HI>Herein is implied per&s;everance in the way of Grace and Salvation to the end.</HI> The Text doth not only &s;ay work, but <HI>work out,</HI> which noteth an holding out in the way of <HI>Salvation</HI> to the end. The Greek word here
<PB N="222" REF="002260_0246_0FDAE0978A096988">
u&s;ed, is a word of Perfection, and implieth a full and final ending of a matter. It is as if the Apo&s;tle had &s;aid, <HI>You mu&s;t never leave working about your Salvation, till you have fi|ni&s;hed it, till you have made compleat work of it.</HI> As it is &s;aid concerning the Righteous, <HI>that he &s;hall hold on in his way,</HI> Job 17.9.

<P N="7">7.

the concernments of others, but mind not at all <HI>their</HI> own; nay it may be, <HI>that</HI> are bu&s;ie in other mens <HI>matters,</HI> which do <HI>not at</HI> all belong <HI>to them,</HI> when in the mean time, the <HI>Salvation</HI> and eternal Concernment of their <HI>own Souls</HI> are not minded as ought to be. There was a time when <HI>Peter</HI> &s;aid concern|ing <HI>John, What &s;hall this man do</HI>? John 21.21.

What is the work that I &s;hould do?</HI> As it was with <HI>John</HI> Bapti&s;ts hearers, Luke 3.12, 13. The people came and &s;aid, <HI>What &s;hall we do?</HI> and the Publicans &s;aid, <HI>What &s;hall we do?</HI> and the Souldiers &s;aid, <HI>What &s;hall we do?</HI> Thus men ought to look to them&s;elves, and to their own particular duty. A man &s;hould watch over his own heart, and look well to the frame of his own &s;pirit; Then may he be &s;aid to work out his <HI>own</HI> Salvation. So much for the fir&s;t thing.</P>
<P>We &s;hould come now to the Rea&s;ons of the Doctrine: I &s;hall mention only one <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> at pre&s;ent, and that &s;hall be taken <HI>from the high and ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of this matter.</HI> Indeed, if it were needle&s;s, or an indifferent matter, men might be held ex|cu&s;ed, though they &s;hould not work out their own Salvation, at lea&s;t though they &s;hould not do it with fear and trembling,

(of which under the next Doctrine) but it is a thing of the greate&s;t concernment and <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> to be performed. It is nece&s;&s;ary in re&s;pect of the Commandment of God, which requireth this work to be done. <HI>There is a nece&s;&s;ity of the Precept,</HI> hence it was &s;aid to the Jews, that <HI>it was</HI> [nece&s;|&s;ary] <HI>that the word &s;hould fir&s;t be &s;poken to them,</HI> Acts 13.46. Why was this nece&s;&s;a|ry? but that &s;o the Commandment of the Lord might be obeyed. The Lord had &s;o commanded, that the Jews &s;hould have the fir&s;t offer of the Go&s;pel, therefore it was <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> that &s;o it &s;hould be. Thus here, the Lord hath commanded that men &s;hould <HI>work out their own Salvation</HI>; hence in this Ver&s;e, doing thus is called. <HI>Obedi|ence,</HI> This is al&s;o a <HI>nece&s;&s;ary mean</HI> in or|der to obtaining Salvation; Salvation is not to be had without this: Hence Chri&s;t &s;aith, <HI>Labour for everla&s;ting life,</HI> John 6.27. Certainly, the Lord would not pre&s;cribe unto men needle&s;s <HI>labour</HI>; if Eternal life could be had without <HI>Labour</HI>; if Salvation were to be obtained without <HI>working,</HI> the Lord would not require men thus to do. It is true, that if God hath decreed a mans Salvation, he &s;hall be &s;aved, but not without the u&s;e of means; for God hath decreed, that the end and the means &s;hall go toge|ther; we may therefore &s;ay here, as <HI>Paul</HI> &s;peaketh concerning his preaching the Go&s;|pel,

Alas! thus it is with men, yea, with the mo&s;t of men, and with the greate&s;t part of Chri&s;tians al&s;o, their time &amp; hearts are taken up about a thou&s;and needle&s;s <HI>things:</HI> One man is careful how he may build a great hou&s;e, but <HI>this is not needful</HI>; another is troubled about his Trading, how he may grow rich in this World, <HI>but this is not needful</HI>; another is taking care night &amp; day, how he may have Portions for his Chil|dren after him, <HI>but this is not needful; There is one thing needful,</HI> to make &s;ure of Salvati|on, that's needful to do, as <HI>Mary</HI> did, even to hearken to, and to obey the Doctrine of

Chri&s;t, which teacheth the way unto Salva|tion; this is needful, for a man to make &s;ure that it &s;hall go well with his Immortal Soul, when he &s;hall dye, and leave this World: Oh that is needful!</P>
<P>We therefore proceed unto the U&s;e of the point; let it be a word of earne&s;t <HI>Ex|hortation.</HI> Oh <HI>make &s;ure of your own Salva|tion.</HI> Con&s;ider well what you heard but now concerning the nece&s;&s;ity of this matter, Salvation is that which mu&s;t be had. As we &s;ay of bread. <HI>Bread mu&s;t be had</HI>; &s;o may we &s;ay of Salvation; <HI>It mu&s;t be had</HI>; you are undone without it for ever. It had been better for you that you had never been born, than that you &s;hould mi&s;s of <HI>Salvation</HI> at la&s;t. As the Di&s;ciples once cried out, <HI>Save us, Lord, or we peri&s;h,</HI> Mat. 8.25. So there is no middle way between the&s;e two, but either you mu&s;t have Eternal Salvation, or el&s;e you mu&s;t to Eternal Damnation.</P>

<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> Oh that there were many of you that did in earne&s;t make &s;uch enquiries. Ob|&s;erve then the&s;e Rules of Direction.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Take heed of thinking that you are in a &s;tate, or in the way of Salvation, when as it is not &s;o.</HI> Alas, it is thus with many, &amp; this proveth the Eternal ruine of their Souls, Prov. 14.12. <HI>There is a way which &s;eemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the

ways of death:</HI> There are that think they are going in the way which leads unto Life, when-as they are going in the way which will bring them down into the Chambers of Death. So it was with the Phari&s;ees: therefore Chri&s;t &s;aid to them, <HI>that he came not to call the righteous, but &s;inners to repen|tance</HI>; And <HI>that the whole have no need of a Phy&s;itian, but the &s;ick,</HI> Mat 9 13. They were righteous in their own eyes, they conceited them&s;elves to be whole, and thence never &s;ought after Chri&s;t the Phy&s;itian of Souls for help and healing. This conceit was their ruine. Thus it is with millions, they feel not their need of Chri&s;t: Every man indeed <HI>knoweth,</HI> as to a general <HI>Notio|nal</HI> Conviction, that he hath need of Chri&s;t, but few that <HI>feel</HI> it. Men &s;ee not them|&s;elves in a Chri&s;tle&s;s, lo&s;t condition, and thence they peri&s;h. This al&s;o was <HI>La<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">di|cea's</HI> undoing, Rev. 3.17. <HI>Thou &s;aye&s;t, I am rich, and encrea&s;ed in goods, and have need of nothing, and knowe&s;t not that thou art wretch|ed, and mi&s;erable, and poor, and blind, and naked.</HI> This is the rea&s;on why many are never &s;aved, even becau&s;e they think them|&s;elves &s;ure of Salvation already. Many mil|lions of tho&s;e lo&s;t Souls that are dropt down for ever into the pit of Eternal Darkne&s;s, this which you now hear was their ruine.</P>

mu&s;t beware of &s;uch. Alas, this which I now &s;peak of, hath been the ruine of ma|ny a Soul that hath been in a hopeful way towards Heaven.

Ser|vants are bid to be obedient to their Ma&s;|ters, <HI>fearing God.</HI> That which in one place is expre&s;&s;ed by <HI>fear and trembling,</HI> is in the other place called <HI>fearing God.</HI> Thus al&s;o, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7.1. <HI>Perfect holine&s;s in the fear of God.</HI> There the Apo&s;tle doth exhort the <HI>Corinthians</HI> unto the &s;ame duty, which here he exhorteth the <HI>Philippians</HI> unto: <HI>To perfect holine&s;s in the fear of God,</HI> and to <HI>work out our Salvation with fear and trembling,</HI> are the &s;ame thing. I &s;ay, an holy fear of God, namely, le&s;t he &s;hould be di&s;honoured, as the Lord &s;peaketh by the Prophet <HI>Malachi, If I he a Lord, where is my fear? and if I be a Father, where is my honour?</HI> Mal. 1.6 This is indeed the true fear of God, when a man is afraid le&s;t Gods name &s;hould any way &s;uffer di&s;honour by him; and when a man is afraid of lo&s;ing Gods favour, and dreads the di&s;plea&s;ure of God as the greate&s;t evil.

Self-Confidence is a fore-runner of De&s;truction; &s;o fear, in re&s;pect of a mans own weakne&s;s and jealou&s;ie over his own heart, is a notable means of being pre&s;erved unto Salvation. Therefore,</P>
<P N="5">5. Herein is implied. <HI>Lowline&s;s and Hu|mility.</HI> Some have well ob&s;erved, that this phra&s;e of <HI>Fear and Trembling,</HI> is u&s;ed five times in the Scripture, and always it is ta|ken in this &s;en&s;e, even for Lowline&s;s and Humility. And this &s;uits here with the Context, where the &s;cope of the Apo&s;tle (as before was intimated) is to exhort to <HI>Humility and Self-denial</HI>; and this is ex|pre&s;&s;ed by &s;aying, <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rk out your Salvation with fear and trembling.</HI> There are two mighty hindrances of Salvation; One is <HI>Sec|urity,</HI> unto this <HI>fear</HI> is oppo&s;ed; if you would be &s;aved, then beware of Security, but <HI>fear.</HI> Another hindrance of Salvation is <HI>Pride,</HI> unto this <HI>Trembling</HI> or <HI>Humility</HI> is oppo&s;ed. And this is well put in, becau&s;e if men work about their Salvation, they are apt to be proud. There is nothing more natural unto man, than to be proud &amp; &s;elf-confident by rea&s;on of his own works. If men labour in the practice of works of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, which are, though<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> not the cau&s;e, yet the way unto life and happinne&s;s,

they are apt to re&s;t therein; and &s;uch Souls are in the greate&s;t danger of ruine. There is no evil more dangerous than that of &s;piri|tual Pride, when men re&s;t in their Prayers and Duties and good Works; therefore this of <HI>Trembling</HI> is fitly put in by the Apo&s;tle, <HI>when he exhorts to work about our own Sal|vation.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. Herein is implied <HI>great care and di|ligence in the work of Salvation.</HI> This fear is not a fear of <HI>Diffidence,</HI> but of <HI>Diligence</HI>; It is not I &s;ay, a fear of Di&s;tru&s;t or de&s;pair, as if a man could not be a&s;&s;ured of his <HI>Sal|vation,</HI> no &s;uch thing is intended or implied in the word&punc; for that is contrary to other Scriptures, which require us to endeavour after <HI>A&s;&s;urance,</HI> which &s;heweth that A&s;&s;u|rance is attainable; and al&s;o, contrary to the experience of Saints, who have &s;ome of them had <HI>a full A&s;&s;urance.</HI> But it intima|teth, that men &s;hould be very diligent in endeavouring after <HI>Salvation</HI>; that every one &s;hould make this matter of <HI>Salvation</HI> his main bu&s;ine&s;s. And not to do, as mo&s;t do, <HI>who</HI> mind other things in the fir&s;t place, &amp; look af|ter Salvation, and the Eternal Concernments of their Souls only in the &s;econd place. But we &s;hould remember and do what Chri&s;t &s;aith, <HI>Mat</HI> 6.33. <HI>Seek fir&s;t the Kingdom of God, and his Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and all the&s;e things &s;hall be added to you.</HI> Even &s;o Sal|vation, the great things of the Kingdom

<P>Qu 2. <HI>But why &s;hould it be thus</HI>?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> That is the &s;econd thing to be &s;po|ken to: We &s;hall only mention two <HI>Rea|&s;ons</HI> of this point.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Becau&s;e of the difficulty which is in attaining to Salvation.</HI> Heaven is in the Scripture compared to an Hill, even &s;o go|ing towards Heaven, is going up Hill. Now that's hard; to go down Hill is natural and ea&s;ie, &s;o it is in going to Hell. But going in the way of Salvation, is like going up hill, or like &s;wimming again&s;t the &s;tream, which you know is not ea&s;ie. The way of Salvation is a <HI>narrow way</HI> You have heard that Chri&s;t hath &s;aid, <HI>Narrow is the way which leadeth unto Life.</HI> Now if a man be walking in a narrow path, he had need look well to every &s;tep that he taketh, le&s;t haply he &s;hould turn out of the right way. The gate of Salvation is a <HI>&s;trait gate</HI>; therefore Chri&s;t hath &s;aid, <HI>Strive to enter in at the &s;trait gate, for many &s;hall &s;eek, and &s;hall not be able,</HI> Luke 13 24. If a man were to go in at a wide gate, that were ea&s;ie, and needed no &s;triving about it; but to get in at a &s;trait gate, will co&s;t a man labour and &s;triving</P>
<P>But a little to enlarge here; there are two things e&s;pecially that &s;hew the difficul|ty which is in obtaining Salvation: And
<PB N="242" REF="002260_0266_0FDAE1158899BC88">
that therefore it is to be &s;ought after with fear and trembling.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>In that there are many Impediments to hinder a man from coming into, or from going on in the way of &s;alvation.</HI> There are many and mighty Enemies unto Salvation. As now the Devil is one Enemy to Salvation, his name is <HI>Abaddon,</HI> and <HI>Apollyon,</HI> that is, a De&s;troyer: Chri&s;t and Satan are mo&s;t con|trary in Nature, Properties and Works; Chri&s;ts work is to be a Saviour of Souls, but the Devils work is to be a De&s;troyer of Souls. And this is a mighty Enemy; hence the Scripture &s;peaketh of <HI>the power of the Ene|my,</HI> and the Apo&s;tle &s;aith, <HI>We wre&s;tle not with fle&s;h and blood,</HI> that is, not with weak Enemies, but with <HI>Principalities and Powers,</HI> even with &s;trong and potent Enemies, <HI>Eph.</HI> 6.13. And al&s;o a mo&s;t &s;ubtile Enemy, there|fore compared, not only to a Serpent, but to an Old Serpent, <HI>Rev.</HI> 12.9. becau&s;e of his ex|ceeding &s;ubtilty. Now if a man hath a po|tent and p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">litick Enemy to watch all oppor|tunities again&s;t, this calls for fear and care, le&s;t his Enemies &s;hould be his ruine. Satan labours by <HI>fraud</HI> to hinder the Salvation of &s;inners; thence &s;ometimes he per&s;wades them, that they are in the way of <HI>Salvation,</HI> when as it is not &s;o; and &s;ometimes he per|&s;wadeth a &s;inner, that it is &s;oon enough, &amp; too &s;oon for to look after Salvation: Thus he ruines many by <HI>Pre&s;umption.</HI> Al&s;o he la|bours to hinder the Salvation of Souls by
<PB N="243" REF="002260_0267_0FDAE0EE7A6D13B8">
<HI>force,</HI> and thence per&s;wadeth them, that it is too late for them to look after <HI>Sal|vation,</HI> and &s;o ruins them by <HI>de&s;pair.</HI> The <HI>Devil</HI> doth what he can to keep men from entring into the way of <HI>Salvation</HI>; or if he cannot do <HI>that,</HI> then he endeavours to hin|der them from going on in <HI>that</HI> way: Whence it is <HI>that</HI> they <HI>that</HI> are brought into the &s;ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e of <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Salvation,</HI> meet with new fears, new difficulties, new temptations, which other men are not acquainted with, and which them&s;elves in former times were not troubled with.</P>
<P>Again the <HI>World</HI> is another Enemy, which doth greatly hinder mens Salvation. Worldly Incumbrances are a marvellous Impediment; hence is that <HI>Heb.</HI> 12.10. <HI>Let us lay a&s;ide every Weight.</HI> What are the&s;e weights but worldly Incumbrances? If a man hath weights tied about his legs, the&s;e will hinder him from making <HI>any great</HI> progre&s;s in his way: So it is here, worldly Incumbrances are as weights which hinder from going forward in the way to Salvation. There are <HI>the reputed good things of the World,</HI> and in the&s;e there is a temptation and a &s;nare to the Soul; <HI>e.g. worldly gain</HI> &amp; <HI>profit</HI> is an heavy &s;nare, &amp; that which hindreth the Salvation or many a Soul. Some that have bid fair for Heaven, yet have fallen &s;hort at la&s;t, becau&s;e of this: &s;ome that have
<PB N="244" REF="002260_0268_0FDAE1171089DF18">
wrought much and long about their Sal|vation, yet have not been able to work it out by rea&s;on of this &s;nare. We read in the Go&s;pel, of a man that came to Chri&s;t to know what he &s;hould <HI>do</HI> that he might have Eternal Life: He was willing to <HI>work,</HI> that he might be <HI>Saved:</HI> He came with a Legal Que&s;tion, and with a Legal Spirit: Chri&s;t Suiteth his An&s;wer according to the Enquirer, and tells him of ob&s;erving the Commandments of the Law. The man profe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;eth, that he had been diligen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in keeping the&s;e for many years: Chri&s;t then toucheth him where his greate&s;t wound &amp; &s;nare was, namely, his inordinate love to earthly things, and <HI>to try him,</HI> the Lord bids him for&s;ake all his worldly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions to follow him; but then the man g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h away with a &s;ad heart, &s;eeing that he mu&s;t either mi&s;s of Eternal Salvation, or lo&s;e the World, and of the two, chu&s;eth rather to part with Eternal Life, then to part with his Worldly gain: Hereupon Chri&s;t &s;aid, <HI>How hardly &s;hall they that have riches, enter into the Kingdom of God: It is ea&s;ier for a Camel to go through a needles eye, than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God,</HI> Luke 18.24, 25. It is an hard matter for any man to be &s;aved; but for a rich man much

more hard than for others; were it not that with God all things are po&s;&s;ible, it would not be po&s;&s;ible for &s;uch an one to be &s;aved. So for the <HI>plea&s;ures of the World,</HI> they are a great &s;nare and hindrance to Salvation. A man mu&s;t for&s;ake the&s;e &s;o far as they &s;tand in oppo&s;ition to the will of God, but it is hard &s;o for to do: How hard is it for a carnal heart to for|&s;ake the plea&s;ures of &s;in? A poor Crea|ture thinks with him&s;elf, <HI>if I &s;hould turn into the way of Salvation, then I must never &s;ee a merry day more</HI>; here his Soul &s;ticks and peri&s;heth. And as for <HI>the evil things of the World,</HI> the&s;e are al&s;o great ob&s;ta|cles in the way to life, <HI>e. g. The cares of that World, the Thorney-ground hearer,</HI> tho' he did and &s;uffered much in order to Sal|vation, he went far, and held out long in an high and glorious Profe&s;&s;ion of the Go&s;pel, yet after all, <HI>the care of this world</HI> proved his ruine, <HI>Mat.</HI> 13.22. Alas, men take more care how they &s;hall live in this World, wherein they &s;hall continue but for a moment, than they do how they &s;hall live in another World, where they mu&s;t be to all Eternity. And hence it is that Salvation is neglected, &amp; the means conducing thereunto are neglected: Men
<PB N="246" REF="002260_0270_0FDAE11942958790">
are not &s;o frequent and diligent in hear|ing the Word as they ought to be, and prayer in Families; but e&s;pecially prayer in &s;ecret is lamentably neglected; &amp; the pretence is, they cannot &s;pare time from their <HI>worldly</HI> occa&s;ions, to attend the&s;e duties of their <HI>Chri&s;tian Calling</HI> Thus doth the World eat out the heart and life of Religion. So for the <HI>Cro&s;&s;es of the World,</HI> they are al&s;o a very great &s;nare. Men would fain have their Heaven here and in Heaven too, they would fain have their Paradi&s;e upon Earth: But when they &s;ee that that cannot be, then they are di&s;|couraged, and knocked off <HI>from Religion, and from Salvation.</HI> There have been that have begun to work about their Salvati|on, that yet have not been able <HI>to work it out,</HI> or to fini&s;h what they begun, becau&s;e of this which you now hear. The Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;pake an excellent Parable to this purpo&s;e, which you may &s;ee, <HI>Luk.</HI> 14.27, 28, 29. <HI>Who&s;oever doth not bear my Cro&s;s, cannot be my Di&s;ciple: Which of you intending to build a Tower, doth not first count the cost; le&s;t after he hath laid the foundation, he is not able to fini&s;h it.</HI> Alas there are that enter upon Religion, and do not think what it will co&s;t them; and thence when they meet with unexpcted,

temptations and difficulties, though they made a good beginning, they come to a mi&s;erable end at la&s;t. Now then ina&s;|much, as the <HI>Profits, Plea&s;ures, Cares, Cro&s;|&s;es</HI> of the World, are &s;uch Impediments in the way to life, men had need work out their Salvation with fear and trembling. Yet there is another Enemy more dange|rous than all the&s;e, that is, <HI>Self.</HI> The An|cient that prayed, <HI>Lord deliver me from that mi&s;erable Wretch my &s;elf</HI>; had a great deal of rea&s;on for what he &s;aid. <HI>Self-de|nial</HI> is requi&s;ite in order to Salvation, as the Apo&s;tle &s;heweth in this Context, but that's an hard task. The fir&s;t Le&s;&s;on in Chri&s;tianity is an hard Le&s;&s;on, namely, that a man mu&s;t <HI>deny him&s;elf,</HI> Mat. 16.24. <HI>Natural Self</HI> mu&s;t be denied, <HI>Prov.</HI> 3.8. <HI>Lean not to thine own under&s;tanding.</HI> A mans <HI>own</HI> under&s;tanding, his <HI>own</HI> will, his <HI>own</HI> affections and inclinations, &s;o far forth as they &s;tand in oppo&s;ition to, or in compe|tition with the will of God, mu&s;t be denied; yet there is no man that hath any acquaintance with his own heart, but finds that this is hard work, &s;o for <HI>Corrupti|on,</HI> &amp; <HI>&s;inful &s;elf,</HI> this mu&s;t be denied; yet this is very difficult: The &s;ins of men are like &s;trong fetters, which keep them from go|ing forward in the way to Salvation. <HI>Pe|ter</HI>
<PB N="248" REF="002260_0272_0FDAE11DD1EDFF10">
&s;aid to <HI>Simon Magus, Thou art in</HI> (<HI>the bond) of Iniquiny,</HI> Acts 8.23. How &s;hould a man that is <HI>bound</HI> hand and foot get for|ward? Thus do the <HI>Bonds of Iniquity,</HI> the Chains of &s;in, keep down the Souls of men, that they cannot mount up towards Hea|ven: A very hard thing it is to part with a beloved darling Lu&s;t.

there is that which is harder than all this, for even <HI>Righteous-&s;elf</HI> mu&s;t be denied al&s;o. The Apo&s;tle &s;heweth the rea&s;on why the Jews mi&s;carried in &s;eeking after Salvation was, becau&s;e <HI>they went about to establi&s;h their own Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> Rom. 10.3. for a man to Confe&s;s Sin, and to Reform, and Hear, and Pray, and Fa&s;t, and yet to renounce all this, and to abhor him&s;elf after all, <HI>this is hard, this is hard.</HI> 2.

Faith in Chri&s;t is nece&s;&s;a|ry to Salvation, but it is no ea&s;ie matter to believe: For a man to renounce Sin, Self and World, and to clo&s;e with Je&s;us Chri&s;t upon his own ble&s;&s;ed Terms, is a hard work: Therefore Chri&s;t hath &s;aid, John 6.44. <HI>No man can come to me, except the Father draw him</HI>: There mu&s;t be <HI>draw|ing</HI> for it, and drawing of the Almighty, or the Soul will never come to Chri&s;t; for &s;in draweth, and the World draweth, and the Devil draweth, to pull the Soul away from Chri&s;t, and therefore except God by an Infinite hand draw the Soul to Chri&s;t, they will not come together.

Work, as a greater never was. When <HI>Christ</HI> was brought into the Pri&s;on of the Grave; the &s;ins and guilt of all the world of God's Elect, was laid upon him, and therefore it was the mightie&s;t work that ever was to rai&s;e Chri&s;t out of the Grave; yet the like Infinite Power is required to make us believe. It is as hard a matter to make a Soul believe, as it is to rai&s;e the dead; and therefore it is a work beyond the power of any man or creature. A car|nal man once having a Daughter in de|&s;pair, being asked how &s;he did, <HI>Tu&s;h, tu&s;h</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>&s;he is well enough, if &s;he would but believe; &s;he aileth nothing, only &s;he wont believe.</HI> Soon after it plea&s;ed God to &s;trike this mans Con&s;cience with terror; &amp; then he was bid to believe; what, can you not believe now? <HI>Oh</HI> (&s;aith he) <HI>there are mil|lions of &s;ins I have been guilty of, and God hath let loo&s;e all the Devils of Hell upon my Soul; and how is it po&s;&s;ible for me to believe</HI>?

<P>We proceed therefore to the U&s;e of the Doctrine: Let it be of earne&s;t Ex|hortation, and that in the words of the Text, <HI>Work out your own Salvation with fear and trembling</HI>: So that you do not only work about, but work out your Salvation, and that you do it <HI>with fear and trembling.</HI> And for rules of Direction here, 1. <HI>Go to work under&s;tandingly.

Chri&s;t is the only &s;afe Foundation to build upon, 1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.11. <HI>Other Foundation can no man lay, be&s;ides that which is laid, even Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI>: Therefore &s;ee that you build upon him, and upon him wholly and only: Not partly upon Chri&s;t, and partly upon other things, but wholly on Chri&s;t alone. 3. <HI>Be often examining how this work goes forward</HI>: The rea&s;on why this work of a mans <HI>own Salvation</HI> goeth no more forward, is, becau&s;e the duty of <HI>Self Examination</HI> is no more practi&s;ed: There|fore examine whether you have Grace, 2 <HI>Cor:</HI> 13.5. and whether you grow in Grace: exa|mine whether you have laid a good Found|ation, and al&s;o how far you proceeded in the work. Alas, &s;ome think the work is well over, when it is to begin &s;till; and the rea&s;on of their mi&s;take is, becau&s;e they do not take pains to examine how matters &s;tand between God and their Souls. I have Read of a Heathen, that every day when night came, would call him&s;elf to an ac|count; and if he had not received and done &s;ome good that day, he would be much troubled. Alas, how much do many Chri&s;tians fall &s;hort of this? 4. <HI>Allow time for this matter, and make it your work.</HI> Great works mu&s;t have time allowed to do them

in. Now <HI>the greate&s;t work which every Man hath to do in this World, is to make &s;ure that his Soul get &s;afe to Heaven, when he dyeth and leaveth this World</HI>; Therefore allow your &s;elves time to attend the Duties of your general Calling, every day allow your &s;elves time for reading the Scripture, and for Prayer in your Familes, and in your Clo|&s;ets al&s;o; you can allow your &s;elves time for other matters, nay it may be needle&s;s matters, and very vanities; and will you not allow time to look after the Eternal Concernments of your imortal Souls? you can allow your &s;elves time to &s;leep, and will you not allow your &s;elves time to pray? Rather be without &s;leep, nay without ne|ce&s;&s;ary Food, than live without Prayer, and &s;ee that you make this bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Salva|tion your work.</HI> Do not think to make it a by work, which you will mind when you have nothing el&s;e to do. But whatever be done, or le&s;t undone, let not this matter of your Salvation be left undone, <HI>Luke</HI> 10. two la&s;t Ver&s;es. 5. <HI>Set about the work, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in your own, but in the strength of Chri&s;t,</HI> 1. Sam. 2.9. By <HI>strength,</HI> that is, Humane&punc; &s;trength, <HI>&s;hall no man prevail:</HI> You will certainly mi&s;carry in the work, if you &s;et upon it in your own &s;trength: There are
<PB N="256" REF="002260_0280_0FDAE124846EE728">
mighty Corruptions (Sons of <HI>Anak</HI>) to be &s;ubdued, there are mighty &s;trong Tempta|tions to be re&s;i&s;ted, there are great Duties to be performed; therefore enter upon all in <HI>the</HI> name of Chri&s;t, <HI>Phil.</HI> 4.13. <HI>I can do all things through Christ &s;trengthening of me.</HI> Then may you be able to &s;ubdue <HI>all</HI> Corruptions, re&s;i&s;t <HI>all</HI> Temptations, perform <HI>all</HI> Duties, bear <HI>all</HI> Afflictions, if the &s;trength of Chri&s;t be engaged with you &amp; for you. 6. <HI>Live in love and peace amongst your &s;elves.</HI> The Apo&s;tle in this Context is exhorting to peace and unity, and then &s;aith, <HI>Work out your own Salvation:</HI> Why, wha't that to the bu&s;ine&s;s of Salvation? Oh yes very much, for Divi&s;ions do exceedingly hinder Salvat|ion-work: Therefore it is that the Devil maketh it his main de&s;ign to &s;ow di&s;cord among&s;t Chri&s;tians, becau&s;e he l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">eth that the work of God will never go forward as it &s;hould do, if there be Contentions and Schi&s;ms among&s;t the Lords people. Alas, when it is thus, mens time &amp; &s;pirits will be taken up about parties, that every one in&s;tead of working out his own Salvation, will be &s;tudying and bu&s;ying him&s;elf how he may promote the intere&s;t of his own party &amp; faction: I tremble to think what account many among&s;t us will be able to give unto Chri&s;t another day in this re&s;pect.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="002260_0281_0FDAE0FCC5B49628">Now for Motives here,</P>
<P>Con&s;ider. 1. <HI>The po&s;ibility which is in this thing</HI> which you are exhorted unto. Indeed it is an hard matter for men to work out their own Salvation (as but now was pro|ved unto you) yet it is po&s;&s;ible: If you will <HI>abound in the work of the Lord, your labour &s;hall not be in vain,</HI> 1. Cor. 15. <HI>ult.</HI> Certain it is, that there is a po&s;&s;ibility of being &s;aved, for Chri&s;t hath purcha&s;ed Sal|vation: And God freely offers it in the Go&s;pel to all that will accept of it, upon gracious and ble&s;&s;ed terms. Be&s;ides, if a man be once brought into the way of Salvation, he is then able (by the Grace of God) to <HI>work out his Salvation.</HI> A man that hath not Grace, is not able <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o give him&s;elf Grace; but a man that hath Grace, is able to get more Grace, if he will be laborious in improving what he hath, <HI>Matth.</HI> 13.12.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider. 2. <HI>The momenteous greatne&s;s of this matter</HI>: It is a matter of the highe&s;t concernment which now you hear of; and therefore you had need be conver&s;ant about it, <HI>with fear and trembling.</HI> If a man were &s;et about a work, and it were &s;aid to him, if you do your work well, you &s;hall live, but if you do not your work well,
<PB N="258" REF="002260_0282_0FDAE126066DC080">
you &s;hall dye; With what trembling would he do it? So 'tis here, if you do this work well, you &s;hall live; but if other|wi&s;e, you &s;hall dye: You are about a matter of life and death, nay, of Eternal life or Eternal death, and therefore you need be in good earne&s;t. Of &s;uch moment is this Salvation, that if a man &s;hould fall &s;hort of it, all the World is never able to make him amends, or to countervail his lo&s;e: You know what Chri&s;t hath &s;aid, <HI>Matth.</HI> 16.26. <HI>What is a man profited, if he &s;hall gain the whole World, and lo&s;e his own Soul? or what &s;hall a man give in ex|change for his Soul?</HI> If a man &s;hould lo&s;e the Salvation of his Soul, all the World can never make him amends for that lo&s;e.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider. 3. <HI>That Salvation is not in your own hands, but depends on the good plea&s;ure of God:</HI> This is the motive which the Apo&s;tle makes u&s;e of in this context, <HI>Work out your own Salvation with fear and trembling; For</HI> (&s;aith he) <HI>it is God that worketh of his own good plea&s;ure:</HI> As if it were &s;aid, <HI>Tremble</HI> to mis God's &s;ea&s;on; if you do not work out your Salvation, it may be God's &s;ea&s;on will be over, and then you may go to work, and all in vain. <HI>Remember</HI> what you have heard concerning the
<PB N="259" REF="002260_0283_0FDAE0FE410BA3A0">
&s;trivings of Gods Spirit, he will not &s;trive always: <HI>Remember</HI> how it was with <HI>E&s;au:</HI> And <HI>Remember</HI> how it was with the Children of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> they neglected God's &s;ea&s;on, and afterwards laboured in vain to enter into <HI>Canaan. Remember</HI> how it was with the fooli&s;h Virgins, they came and knocked and cryed, and &s;aid, <HI>Lord, Lord, open unto us</HI>; but the door was &s;hut upon them.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider. 4. <HI>That except you [work out] your Salvation, you had as good do nothing.</HI> Though you &s;hould <HI>work,</HI> if you do not <HI>work out,</HI> you do nothing. As in running a Race except a Man <HI>hold out</HI> to the end of his Race, he lo&s;eth the Crown; O then, be &s;ure that you &s;o run as that you may obtain, 1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 9.24. You may run, you may labour, and yet not obtain the Crown of Life, except ye <HI>&s;o run,</HI> as to come to the end of your Chri&s;tian Cour&s;e. You may work, and yet mi&s;s of Salvation, except you <HI>work it out</HI>; and you mu&s;t <HI>begin well, and hold on well, and end well,</HI> if you de&s;ire happine&s;s. O how lamantable is it for a man to peri&s;h eternally, after he hath done and &s;uffered many things, after he hath made many prayers, and heard many Sermons, and it may be come to
<PB N="260" REF="002260_0284_0FDAE127ABAA92D8">
many Sacraments, after all this to peri&s;h, that's exceeding lamantable! to be ca&s;t away in the Harbours mouth as it were, to dye within &s;ight of <HI>Canaan,</HI> to go to Hell after the Soul hath been within on &s;tep of Heaven, that's &s;ad indeed. Now the Lord write the&s;e things in your hearts by the finger of his holy Spirit, and help you <HI>to work out your own Salvation with fear and trembling.</HI></P>
