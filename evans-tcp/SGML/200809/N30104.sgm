Moreover, while thou art in thy Chri&s;t|le&s;s State, God's Wrath is &s;till burning a|gain&s;t thee, the flaming Sword of Ju&s;tice is always over thy Neck, P&s;al. vii. 11. <HI>God is angry with the wicked every Day,</HI> every Day of the Week, and every Hour of the Day; when thou goe&s;t out and come&s;t in, ri&s;e it up, or lye&s;t down, God is &s;till angry with thee; yea, <HI>He hath bent his Bow, and made ready his Arrows,</HI> which are &s;teeled with Wrath, and headed with Vengeance; nay, his Bow is drawn, and his Arrows are at the Flight; and, O Chri&s;tle&s;s Soul, thou art only the Butt thereof, and if he let them fly, they will pierce thee to the very Soul, and who will heal that Wound? What a dangerous State is this?</P>
<P>And further, All the Cur&s;es of the Law are levelled again&s;t thee, and a ju&s;t God is engaged by his Oath to ruin thee, if thou abide&s;t in this State, Heb. iii. 18. <HI>To whom &s;ware he, that they &s;hould not enter into his Re&s;t, but to them that believed not.</HI> Should not the Thoughts of this make thee tremble? Were it but the Oath of a Man or a Company of Men to procure thy Death as of the&s;e forty Men that bound them&s;elves with an Oath, they would nei|ther Eat nor Drink till they killed <HI>Paul,</HI> it would bereave thee of thy Nights re&s;t and quiet till they were made Friends with thee; And will the Oath of the great God have no Effect upon thee, nor move <PB N="5" REF="039983_0004_1015866EDEED1D40">thee to flee to Chri&s;t for Protection and Reconciliation? Who can help thee or deal for thee, if Chri&s;t be neglected? With what Face can&s;t thou look to him, or cry for Mercy from him, when he comes to judge thee at the la&s;t Day. If thou remain Chri&s;tle&s;s now, thou wilt be Speechle&s;s, Helple&s;s and Hopele&s;s then. O think, what pale Faces, quivering Lips, fainting Hearts &amp; trembling Con&s;ciences will be among Chri&s;tle&s;s Sin|ners chen? How will their Heads hang down, and Knees knock together, and cry, alas for the Day! They can look no where for Comfort, for the Judge frowns on them, the Saints deride them, their own Friends upbraid them, the Angels mock them, the Devils &s;coff at them, the Heavens thunder again&s;t them, the Earth flames about them, and Hell groans for them, and down they will go roaring and howling for ever.</P>
<P>O Chri&s;tle&s;s Soul, how can'&s;t thou think to ly in that dark Dungeon for ever, where there is nothing but <HI>weeping and gua&s;hing of Teeth</HI> to be heard, and <HI>utter Darkne&s;s</HI> to be &s;een, but never the lea&s;t Sight of the Light of God's Favour to all Eternity? How wilt thou live in that <HI>Pit where there is no Water</HI>? Not a Drop of Comfort or Refre&s;hment to the thir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ty &s;corched Pri&s;oners, no, not &s;o much as one Drop to cool their Tongue, the Torments there are both Endle&s;s and Ea&s;ele&s;s.

<P>II.

Put all your other Sins in one Scale, and Unbelief in another, and you will find that Unbelief weighs down all the Re&s;t, for it is a &s;lighting of the whole Work of Redemption, which is the Ma&s;ter|piece of all God's Works, being that which hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Heart is mo&s;t &s;et upon, and he hath been at mo&s;t Pains about, I <HI>John</HI> iv. 9.

<P>III. Con&s;ider what an un&s;peakable Mer|cy and Happine&s;s it is to you, to enjoy the free Offers of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and to have God commanding you to receive him. How would the fallen Angels value &s;uch a Mer|cy, if they had it? They would not be loth to leave their Dungeon and accept of a Saviour as you are: But their State is e|ternally hopele&s;s and de&s;perate, there is no Remedy for their Mi&s;ery; O do not put your &s;elves in the &s;ame Ca&s;e with them by &s;lighting the offered Remedy. How would damned Souls prize &s;uch an Offer? The lea&s;t News, and remote&s;t Hopes of it would make them leap in their Chains, and &s;ing in the Flames. O how glad would they be to lift up their flaming Hands to take hold of the Cords of Love and Mercy if they could be let down to them in that dark Dungeon? <PB N="8" REF="039983_0006_10158673919E48D0">Why then &s;hould ye wilfully put your &s;elves into the &s;ame hopele&s;s Condition with them by your Unbelief? Nay, your neglecting &s;o many Offers, will &s;ink you far deeper in that &s;calding Lake of Fire and Brim&s;tone, and increa&s;e your Flames to more Vehemency than the&s;e of others who have not been &s;o privileged. O how will <HI>Devils, Turks, Jesus</HI> and <HI>Pagans</HI> up|braid you there, for your inexcu&s;eable Fol|ly in &s;lighting your Mercy, and de&s;troying your Souls? Be wi&s;e then in Time. prize your Privilege, and <HI>con&s;ider the Things that belong to your Peace, before they be hid from your Eyes.</HI></P>
<P>IV. Con&s;ider what an excellent &amp; &s;uit|able Help Chri&s;t is for fallen Sinners; he is well furni&s;hed and qualified for your Ca&s;e, he hath <HI>Gold</HI> for your Poverty, <HI>Eye|&s;alve</HI> for your Blindne&s;s, <HI>Balm</HI> for your Wounds, <HI>Phy&s;ick</HI> for your Di&s;ea&s;es, <HI>Bread</HI> for your Hunger, <HI>White Raiment</HI> for your Nakedne&s;s, a <HI>Fountain</HI> for your Pollution, and a <HI>Ran&s;om</HI> for your Debt and Bondage. In a Word, he hath a broad Plai&s;ter for your broad Sore, a deep Fountain for your deep Guilt; he is the chief of Savi|ours for the chief of Sinners. Behold how one Deep calls to another, the Depth of thy Mi&s;ery, for the Depth of his Mercy. Are your Sins and Mi&s;eries very exten&s;ive, then view the large Dimen&s;ions of his Mercy, Who can fathom the Height, the Depth, the Breadth or Length of it? As <PB N="9" REF="039983_0006_10158673919E48D0">for its Height, it is high as Heaven, and &s;urmounts the highe&s;t Mountains of Guilt: It is &s;o deep that it can bury the greate&s;t of your Sins: It is as broad as the Ea&s;t is from the We&s;t: And for its Length, it is from Everla&s;ting to Everla&s;ting, &s;o that it fully an&s;wers all your Wants and Mi&s;eries. In Chri&s;t there is all you need or can de|&s;ire; there is both. Food and Phy&s;ick, Cloathing, Strength, and Cordials; O Sin|ner, here is Blood to ju&s;tify thee, and Wa|ter to clean&s;e; here the Water of Life, O Believer, that will re&s;tore thy Soul again, renew thy Youth as the Eagles, cure all thy Di&s;ea&s;es, and heal all thy Pains. In a word, you have in Chri&s;t all that can make you Good, all that can make you Great, and all that can make you Happy.</P>
<P>V. Con&s;ider how <HI>near</HI> you are to Chri&s;t and Mercy, the Remedy is prepared, and Salvation is brought to your very Door, &s;o that you need not &s;ay, <HI>who will a&s;cend to Heaven, to bring me down the Water of Life</HI>; for it is brought to Earth to thy Hand: You need not &s;ay, <HI>Who will roll me away the Stone from the Well Mouth</HI>? for Chri&s;t hath done it for thee, and it is now a <HI>Foun|tain opened,</HI> and running by your Door. O it would be &s;ad to be &s;o near Chri&s;t, and yet eternally mi&s;s him, to peri&s;h like the Thief on the Cro&s;s with a Saviour at your Side, to be within a Step of him, and yet never touch him, yea to &s;ink into Hell

Behold, how earne&s;t he is with Sinners, that he bids them <HI>come</HI> to him three Times in one Ver&s;e, <HI>Come, Come, Come.</HI> What alluring Methods hath he

<P>Nay, he is content to follow you, when we run away from him, and pur&s;ue you with his gracious Offers: As the <HI>Rock fol|lowed the I&s;raelites in the Wilderne&s;s</HI> with its running Streams of Water, &s;o Chri&s;t our &s;piritual Rock follows you now with the Streams of his Mercy and Blood, to wa&s;h and &s;ave you.

Were it any Lo&s;s or Trouble for God to help us, we might well doubt of it; but &s;ince it is none, we may cry with Hope, Lord grant &s;uch an hungry Beggar an Alms out of the Ocean of thy Bounty, for thou wilt never mi&s;s it. As the <HI>Sun,</HI> the more it &s;hines, di&s;plays its Glory the <PB N="29" REF="039983_0016_1015868BF23CF640">more; &s;o thou wilt gain Glory, by put|ting forth thy Power to help &s;uch a Help|le&s;s Creature as I am.</P>
<P>Objection, <HI>But I have often looked and cried to him for Help, but alas, I am &s;uch a grievous Sinner he doth not an&s;wer me, un|le&s;s it be with a Frown.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> 1. It may be there is &s;ome Idol or Sin &s;till harboured, that thou art not willing to part with. This may be the <HI>Achan</HI> in the Camp that cau&s;eth the Lord to hide his Face, &s;earch for it, and ca&s;t out the <HI>accur&s;ed Thing, let not thine Eye pity it, neither do thou &s;pare it.</HI> If thou can&s;t not find it, go humbly to God and cry, <HI>Shew me, Lord, wherefore thou contende&s;t with me.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. It may be thou art not fervent enough, God keeps the Door bolted that you may be provoked to knock the harder, Matth. vii. 7. <HI>Ask and it &s;hall be given, &s;eek,</HI> &amp;c. In that one Ver&s;e you have three Calls to Fervency, not only <HI>Ask</HI> but <HI>Seek,</HI> not only <HI>Seek</HI> but <HI>Knock</HI>&punc; The Woman of <HI>Canaan</HI> readily took up the Meaning of Chri&s;t's refu&s;ing to an&s;wer her, &s;he turns the more Fervent and Importunate, and &s;o gets all her Will.</P>
<P N="3">3. Re&s;olve whatever Di&s;couragement you meet with, you will never quit the Throne of Grace, but you will always lay your &s;elf in Chri&s;t's Way, and never look to another for Help; yea that you <PB N="30" REF="039983_0017_1015868D87EA5A18">will die waiting on him: Remember the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI>'s Experience, P&s;al. xl. 1. <HI>I wait|ed patiently for the Lord, and at length he inclined his Ear, and heard my Cry:</HI> There was never any yet that waited on him, had cau&s;e to be a&s;hamed. You may meet with many Di&s;couragements and Tempta|tions, and be put to very &s;ad Thoughts, but you mu&s;t be re&s;olute in looking to Chri&s;t for Help, come what will; and in Imitation of the <HI>four Lepers at the Seige of Samaria,</HI> rea&s;on with your &s;elf, if I live at a Di&s;tance from Chri&s;t, I &s;hall infallibly peri&s;h, there is no Hope for me; if Chri&s;t pity me not when I am waiting on him, I &s;hall but peri&s;h, but yet there is Hope he will have Pity at length; there|fore if I peri&s;h, I'll peri&s;h at Chri&s;t's Foot|&s;tool, looking up to him, where never one yet peri&s;h'd, and I hope he will not let me be the fir&s;t.</P>
<P N="4">4. Make u&s;e of Arguments in pleading with him.</P>
<P N="1">1. Plead the Freene&s;s of his Mercy; it needs no Motive, and expects no Worth, but <HI>who&s;oever will, let him come and take the Water of Life freely,</HI> it runs freely, &s;o that Mountains cannot &s;top the current of it, more than Rocks can &s;top the Ebbing and Flowing of the Sea. <Q>Indeed, Lord, if Sin and Unworthine&s;s could &s;top Mercy, I might de&s;pair, for I am as un|worthy a Creature as ever the Sun &s;hin|ed <PB N="31" REF="039983_0017_1015868D87EA5A18">upon, but ble&s;&s;ed be God, Grace is free.</Q></P>
<P N="2">2. Plead Chri&s;t's Commi&s;&s;ion, <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> lxi. 1. He was &s;ent <HI>to proclaim Liberty to the Captives, and the opening of the Pri&s;on Doors to them that are bound:</HI> Lord, here a poor Pri&s;oner, a frozen, locked, bound up Heart: Here is Employment for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, Loo&s;e me, Knock off my Fetters, and <HI>lying my Soul out of Pri&s;on.</HI> Thou ha&s;t all Fulne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> dwelling in thee, and thou ha&s;t it given thee to be&s;tow on &s;uch mi&s;erable Objects as I am; Lord here a naked Back for thee to cover, an empty Stomach for thee to fill, a wounded Soul for thee to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. <HI>Lord thou came&s;t to &s;eek and &s;ave that which was lo&s;t,</HI> and wilt thou not be found of a lo&s;t Sinner that is &s;eeking thee.</P>
<P N="3">3. Plead the Communicativene&s;s of his Mercy to others: He had Compa&s;&s;ion upon Men's Bodies while he was on Earth, even the Bodies of wicked Men, &s;uch as the unthankful Lepers, he let none of them go without healing that came to him; &s;ay, <HI>Lord</HI> did thou &s;hew &s;o much Compa&s;&s;ion to di&s;ea&s;ed Bodies, and w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t thou not have &s;ome Pity on my dying Soul that is far more Precious than C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ca|&s;es of Clay.&mdash;Plead his Compa&s;&s;ion that he hath &s;hewed to the wor&s;t of Sinners, &s;uch as <HI>Mana&s;&s;ch, Mary Magdalen, Paul,</HI> and tho&s;e who murdered him.&mdash;Plead his Compa&s;&s;ion towards the finally Ob&s;tinate, <PB N="32" REF="039983_0018_1015868FAFB6FB28">and Impenitent, &s;uch as <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> over which he wept, <HI>Luke</HI> xix. Lord, did thy Heart melt with Pity to &s;uch, and wilt thou not pity a humbled Sinner, that confe&s;&s;eth Sin and would fain be reconcil|ed to God: Is not Mercy the Work thou delighte&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in? <HI>Mic.</HI> vii. 18.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> Labour for a Sen&s;e of the Mi&s;ery of a Chri&s;tle&s;s State, of your great Need of Chri&s;t, and of the Happine&s;s of being <HI>found in him,</HI> and in a Sen&s;e thereof, look to Chri&s;t and make a trial to take hold of him, &s;tir up your &s;elf to it, and re&s;t your Soul on him as you can, and God will help you and communicate Strength. He will not fail to notice and encourage an hone&s;t Attempt, Jer. xxx. 21. <HI>Who is this that engageth his Heart to approach to me</HI>? He will pity and help &s;uch. If you cannot apply Chri&s;t to your &s;elves and &s;ay, <HI>He is mine,</HI> yet apply your &s;elf to Chri&s;t and &s;ay, <HI>I would fain be thine,</HI> yea I am re&s;olved to be thine. Go forth to Chri&s;t with all the Faith you can arrive at, &s;ay with the poor Man, <HI>Lord I believe, help thou my Unbelief.</HI> You mu&s;t not &s;it &s;till and do nothing, but u&s;e all Means in your Power, for it is in the U&s;e of the&s;e that God works Faith; hoi&s;e up the Sails and wait for the Gales.</P>
