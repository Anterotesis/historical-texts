<HEAD>MEMOIRS OF THE LIFE OF THE REV. MR. GEORGE WHITEFIELD.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> From his Birth, to his going to the Univer&s;ity of <HI>OX|FORD,</HI> Anno <HI>1732.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THIS eminent and pious &s;ervant of Chri&s;t, Mr. GEORGE WHITE|FIELD, was born at Glouce&s;ter, on the 16th day of December, O. S. 1714. His father, Thomas Whitefield, nephew of the Rev. Mr. Samuel Whitefield of Rock|hampton, in Glouce&s;ter&s;hire <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Rev. Mr. Samuel Whitefield, great grand|father of George, was born at Wantage in Berk&s;hire, and was Rector of North Ledyard in Wilt&s;hire. He removed afterwards to Rockhampton. He had five daughters, two of whom were married to clergymen, Mr. Perkins and Mr. Lovingham: And two &s;ons, Sa|muel, who &s;ucceeded his father in the cure of Rock|hampton, and died without i&s;&s;ue; and Andrew, who was a private gentleman, and lived retired upon his e&s;tate. Andrew had fourteen children, of whom Thomas was the elde&s;t, the father of Mr. George Whitefield.</NOTE>, was fir&s;t bred to the employment of a wine merchant in Bri&s;tol; but afterwards kept an inn in the city of
<PB N="26" REF="013298_0026_0F8FFAD3CB1C44D0">
Glouce&s;ter. In Bri&s;tol he married Mi&s;tre&s;s Elizabeth Edwards, who was related to the Blackwells and the Dimours of that city; by whom he had &s;ix &s;ons and one daughter <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Elizabeth, the daughter, was twice reputably married at Bri&s;tol. John, his &s;on, lies interred with the family in St. Mary Decrypt church in Glouce&s;ter. Jo&s;eph died an infant. Andrew &s;ettled in trade at Bri&s;tol, and died in the twenty-eighth year of his age. James was Captain of a &s;hip, and died &s;uddenly at Bath. Thomas and Richard are &s;till living. The fa|ther died December 1716. The mother continued a widow &s;even years, and was then married to Mr. Longden, an ironmonger in Glouce&s;ter, by whom &s;he had no i&s;&s;ue. She died December 1751, in the &s;even|ty-fir&s;t year of her age.</NOTE>. Of the&s;e, George was the younge&s;t, who being bereaved of his father, when only two years old, was regarded by his mother with a peculiar ten|derne&s;s, and educated with more than ordinary care.</P>
<P>He was early under religious impre&s;&s;ions; but the bent of his nature, and the general cour&s;e of his younger years, as him&s;elf acknowledges <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See the two fir&s;t parts of his life at the beginning. Confe&s;&s;ions of a like nature, are to be found in the writings of St. Augu&s;tin.</NOTE> with ex|pre&s;&s;ions of &s;hame and &s;elf-condemnation, was of a ve|ry different kind.</P>
<P>Between the years of twelve and fifteen, he made a good progre&s;s in the Latin cla&s;&s;ics, at the public
<PB N="27" REF="013298_0027_0F8FFAD48946DCD8">
&s;chool: and his eloquence began to appear, even at that early period, in the &s;peeches which he delivered at the annual vi&s;itations. It is probable, the applau&s;e he received on the&s;e occa&s;ions, contributed to his fond|ne&s;s for theatrical amu&s;ements: From whence it has been in&s;inuated, that he learned his oratory upon the &s;tage. This, however, &s;eems to have no other foun|dation, than his acting a part &s;ometimes with his fel|low &s;cholars; particularly, in certain dramatic per|formances prepared for them by their ma&s;ter: For that he was more indebted as an orator to nature, than to art of any kind, mu&s;t be evident to all per&s;ons of di&s;|cernment who were acquainted with him. Such could not fail to ob&s;erve, that his eloquence was in a great mea&s;ure the effect of his genius, and proceeded chiefly from that peculiar a&s;&s;emblage of extraordinary talents with which God had endowed him.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this, it appears from his conduct, that he either had not yet di&s;covered where his talents lay, or could not find means to qualify him&s;elf for en|tering into any profe&s;&s;ion where they might be proper|ly exerci&s;ed: for, when he was about fifteen years of age, he declined the pur&s;uit of learning, and talked <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> getting an education that would better fit him for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|&s;ine&s;s. During this period, he &s;till continued to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> with his mother; and as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> circum&s;tances were not then &s;o ea&s;y as before, he did not &s;cruple to a&s;&s;i&s;t her in the bu&s;ine&s;s of the tavern. But the prevailing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of his genius began now &s;trongly to di&s;cover it&s;elf; for even in this unfavourable &s;ituation, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">po&s;ed &s;everal &s;ermons, one of which he dedicated in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> elde&s;t brother: And after having vi&s;ited him at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|tol, he came home with a re&s;olution to abandon his pre&s;ent employment, and to turn his thoughts a diffe|rent way.</P>
<P>After this, being for &s;ome time di&s;engaged <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> every pur&s;uit, and but poorly &s;upported out <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> in others &s;canty &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, he was in no &s;mall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="28" REF="013298_0028_0F8FFAD552B638E0">
of being utterly ruined by the influence of his former companions: but it plea&s;ed God to break the &s;nare by filling him with an abhorrence of their evil deeds.</P>
<P>About this time, the impre&s;&s;ions of religion began again to recover their influence in his brea&s;t: And when he was &s;eventeen years of age, he received the &s;acrament of the Lord's Supper. He now became more and more watchful, both over his heart and conver&s;a|tion. He was frequently employed in fa&s;ting and prayer; &s;pentmuch of his time in reading books of de|votion; attended public wor&s;hip twice every day; and &s;o deeply was he engaged in the&s;e exerci&s;es, that his thoughts were con&s;tantly &s;et on the great things of religion.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> From the Time of his going to the Univer&s;ity of <HI>OXFORD,</HI> to his embarking for <HI>GEORGIA,</HI> Anno <HI>1737.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHEN Mr. Whitefield arrived at eighteen, he was &s;ent to the Univer&s;ity of Oxford, where he was again expo&s;ed to the &s;ociety of the wick|ed: But remembering his former danger and delive|rance, by the grace of God, he re&s;i&s;ted all their &s;oli|citations, and cultivated an acquaintance with the Methodi&s;ts, as the only per&s;ons that &s;eemed to pre|&s;erve a &s;en&s;e of religion, through the whole of their deportment.</P>
<P>It would be going beyond our purpo&s;e, to give an account of the ri&s;e of Methodi&s;m: For this, the reader is referred to the Rev. Mr. John We&s;ley's fir&s;t Journal. But it may not be improper to notice the
<PB N="29" REF="013298_0029_0F904F576718FCC8">
&s;pirit of the age, when it fir&s;t appeared. At that time, &s;erious and practical chri&s;tianity in England was in a very low condition; &s;criptural, experimental religion, (which in the la&s;t century u&s;ed to be the &s;ubject of the &s;ermons and writings of the clergy) was become quite unfa&s;hionable; and the only thing in&s;i&s;ted on, was a defence of the out-works of chri&s;tianity again&s;t the objections of infidels. What was the con&s;equence? The writings of infidels multiplied every day, and in|fidelity made a rapid progre&s;s among per&s;ons of every rank, not becau&s;e they were rea&s;oned into it by the force of argument, but becau&s;e they were kept &s;tran|gers to Chri&s;t and the power of the go&s;pel. We have a mo&s;t affecting de&s;cription of this, by Bi&s;hop Butler, whom none will &s;u&s;pect of exaggerating the fact:
<Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Preface to his Analogy, May 1736.</NOTE> It is come, I know not how, to be taken for granted, by many per&s;ons, that chri&s;tianity is not &s;o much as a &s;ubject of inquiry; but that it is, now at length, di&s;covered to be fictitious; and, ac|cordingly they treat it, as if in the pre&s;ent age, this were an agreed point among all people of di&s;|cernment; and nothing remained but to &s;et it up as a principal &s;ubject of mirth and ridicule; as it were by way of repri&s;als, for its having &s;o long in|terrupted the plea&s;ures of the world.</Q>
Such was the &s;tate of religion in England, and Scotland was greedily &s;wallowing down the poi&s;on, when it plea&s;ed God to rai&s;e up the Methodi&s;ts, as in&s;truments to re|vive his work in the mid&s;t of abounding impiety, and to bring multitudes who had &s;carcely a form of godli|ne&s;s, to experience its quickening and renewing power.</P>
<P>Happy was it for Mr. Whitefield, that there was a Society of Methodi&s;ts, at that time, in Oxford, but e&s;pecially, that he became acquainted with the Rev. Mr. Charles We&s;ley, by whom he was treated with particular kindne&s;s. Such benefit did he receive un|der
<PB N="30" REF="013298_0030_0F8FFAD60F69ADC0">
his mini&s;try, that he always accounted him his &s;piritual father. And Mr. We&s;ley's reciprocal affec|tion for him, &s;tands recorded in the ver&s;es at the be|ginning of Mr. Whitefield's &s;econd and third Journals.</P>
<P>Like the other Methodi&s;ts, Mr. Whitefield now began to live by rule, and to improve every moment of his time to the be&s;t advantage. He received the communion every Sabbath, vi&s;ited the &s;ick, and the jail pri&s;oners, and read to the poor. For daring to be thus &s;ingularly religious, he &s;oon incurred the di&s;plea|&s;ure of his fellow-&s;tudents, and felt the effects of it in their unkind behaviour. In the mean time, he was greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed with melancholy thoughts, which were augmented by exce&s;&s;ive bodily au&s;terities. And at la&s;t, by reading, and perhaps mi&s;under&s;tanding &s;ome my&s;tic writers, he was driven to imagine, that the be&s;t method he could take, was to &s;hut him&s;elf up in his &s;tudy, till he had perfectly mortified his own will, and was enabled to do good without any mixture of cor|rupt motives. He likewi&s;e imagined, that he mu&s;t relinqui&s;h external duties, and public wor&s;hip; and la&s;tly, (which was no &s;mall trial and affliction to him) that he mu&s;t deny him&s;elf the plea&s;ure of conver&s;ing with his religious friends. In this pitiable &s;tate of mind, Mr. Charles We&s;ley found him one day, when he went to &s;ee him; apprized him of his danger, if he per&s;i&s;ted in that way of life, and recommended to him his brother, as a per&s;on of greater experience; who readily gave him, from time to time, his friendly advice. Soon after this, however, he carried his ab|&s;tinence and fa&s;ting to &s;uch an extreme, that his body was &s;o emaciated and feeble, that he could hardly walk up &s;tairs. His tutor therefore thought proper to call a phy&s;ician, and it appeared by the event, he had rightly judged in doing &s;o: for it plea&s;ed God to make the phy&s;ician's care and medicines &s;ucce&s;sful to his recovery.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="013298_0031_0F904F57D24F60C0">His bodily health being re&s;tored, his &s;oul was like|wi&s;e filled with peace and joy in believing on the Son of God. This joy was &s;o great for &s;ome time, that go where he would, he could not help prai&s;ing God con|tinually in his heart, and with &s;ome difficulty re&s;train|ed him&s;elf from doing it aloud. As he was urged to go into the country for confirming his health, he re|turned to his native air at Glouce&s;ter, where (his mind being now happily enlightened) he preferred the &s;a|cred writings to all other books, and read them with con&s;tant prayer; in which exerci&s;e he found un&s;peak|able delight and benefit. But inclination con&s;pired with duty, to hinder him from con&s;ining his religion to him&s;elf: Having a heart formed for &s;ociety and friend&s;hip, he could not think of &s;hutting him&s;elf up in his clo&s;et; but made it his bu&s;ine&s;s to conver&s;e with young per&s;ons, about his own time of life, in order to awaken them to a &s;en&s;e of religion. God was plea&s;|ed &s;oon to give &s;ucce&s;s to his endeavours this way; for &s;everal of them joined with him, and notwith|&s;tanding the contempt they knew it would bring up|on them, met together from time to time for religi|ous exerci&s;es. He al&s;o there read to &s;ome poor peo|ple in the town, twice or thrice a week, and read and prayed with the pri&s;oners in the county goal every day.</P>
<P>Being now about twenty-one years of age, he was &s;ent for by Doctor Ben&s;on, Bi&s;hop of Glouce&s;ter; who told him, That though he had purpo&s;ed to ordain none under three and twenty, yet he &s;hould reckon it his duty to ordain him whenever he applied. Upon which, at the earne&s;t per&s;ua&s;ions of his friends, he prepared for taking orders.</P>
<P>His behaviour on this occa&s;ion was very exempla|ry. He fir&s;t &s;tudied the thirty-nine articles, that he might be &s;atisfied of their being agreeable to Scrip|ture. Then he examined him&s;elf by the qualifica|tions of a Mini&s;ter mentioned in the New Te&s;tament,
<PB N="32" REF="013298_0032_0F904F59C5396AE8">
and by the que&s;tions that he knew were to be put to him at his ordination. On the Saturday, he was much in prayer for him&s;elf and tho&s;e who were to be ordained with him. On the morning of his ordi|nation, (which was at Glouce&s;ter, Sunday, June 20, 1736) he ro&s;e early, and again read, with prayer, St. Paul's Epi&s;tles to Timothy, and after his ordination, went to the Lord's Table.</P>
<P>The Sunday following, he preached his &s;ermon on <HI>The Nece&s;&s;ity and Benefit of Religious Society,</HI> to a very crowded auditory; and that &s;ame week he &s;et out for Oxford, whither he inclined to go, rather than to the pari&s;h which the Bi&s;hop would have given him; becau&s;e it was the place where he might be&s;t pro&s;e|cute his &s;tudies, and where he hoped his labours might be mo&s;t u&s;eful.
<Q>La&s;t Sunday in the afternoon, I preach'd my fir&s;t &s;ermon in the church where I was baptized, and al&s;o fir&s;t received the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper. Curio&s;ity drew a large congregation to|gether. The &s;ight, at fir&s;t, a little awed me. But I was comforted with a heart-felt &s;en&s;e of the Divine pre&s;ence: And &s;oon found the advantage of hav|ing been accu&s;tomed to public &s;peaking, when a boy at &s;chool; and of exhorting and teaching the pri|&s;oners and poor people at their private hou&s;es, whil&s;t at the univer&s;ity. By the&s;e means, I was kept from being daunted over much. As I pro|ceeded, I perceived the fire kindled, till at la&s;t, though &s;o young, and amid&s;t a crowd of tho&s;e who knew me in my childi&s;h days, I tru&s;t I was enabled to &s;peak with &s;ome degree of Go&s;pel au|thority. Some few mocked; but mo&s;t for the pre&s;ent &s;eemed &s;truck: and I have &s;ince heard, that a complaint had been made to the Bi&s;hop, that I drove fifteen mad, the fir&s;t &s;ermon. The worthy Prelate, as I am informed, wi&s;hed that the madne&s;s might not be forgotten, before next Sunday <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letter xvi.</NOTE>.</Q>
<PB N="33" REF="013298_0033_0F904F5B0B52D1A8">
Soon after this, he was invited to officiate at the chapel of the Tower of London. The fir&s;t time he preached in London, was Augu&s;t 1736, at Bi&s;hop&s;gate Church. Having a very young look, the people were &s;urpri&s;ed at his appearance, and &s;eemed to &s;neer as he went up to the pulpit; but they had not heard him long, when their contempt was turned into e&s;teem, and their &s;miles into grave attention. He continued at the Tower two months, preaching, catechi&s;ing, and vi&s;it|ing the &s;oldiers; and &s;everal &s;erious young men came to hear his morning di&s;cour&s;es on the Lord's day. In the mean time the letters which the Rev. Me&s;&s;ieurs We&s;leys and Ingham wrote home from Georgia, made him long to go and preach the Go&s;pel in tho&s;e parts; yet he waited till Providence &s;hould make his way more clear, and returning to Oxford, he found him&s;elf ve|ry happy in his former employments, and had much plea&s;ure in reading Henry's Commentary on the Bible, and in the company of &s;ome religious young men, who met together in his chamber every day.</P>
<P>In November 1736, he was again called from Ox|ford, to Mini&s;ter at Dummer in Hamp&s;hire. This was a new &s;phere of action among poor illiterate peo|ple; but he was &s;oon reconciled to it, and thought he reaped no &s;mall profit by conver&s;ing with them. Neverthele&s;s, he continued his &s;tudies with unwea|ried application: Dividing the day into three parts; eight hours for &s;leep and meals, eight for public pray|ers, catechi&s;ing and vi&s;iting; and eight for &s;tudy and retirement. During his &s;tay here, he was invited to a very profitable curacy in London; but did not ac|cept of it, as he was &s;till intent upon going abroad. Providence, at length, &s;eemed to open a door to him; for he received letters, containing what he thought to be an invitation, to go to Georgia, from Mr. John We&s;ley, who&s;e brother came over about this time to procure labourers. It is ea&s;y to judge, how readily this propo&s;al would be embraced: and now that he thought him&s;elf clearly called, (many things concur|ring
<PB N="34" REF="013298_0034_0F904F5C8DA15588">
to make his &s;tay at home le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary) he &s;et his affairs in order, and in January 1737, went to take leave of his friends in Glouce&s;ter and Bri&s;tol. At Glouce&s;ter, the congregations when he preached, were very large, and very &s;erious. At Bri&s;tol, many per|&s;ons were forced to return from the churches where he was invited to preach, for want of room. He went al&s;o to Bath, where he was kindly received, and preach|ed twice. But he did not &s;tay long at any of the&s;e places, being obliged to go to Oxford about the latter end of February; from whence he came up to London, to wait upon General Oglethorp and the Tru&s;tees for Georgia. He was &s;oon introduced to the Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, and the Bi&s;hop of London, who both approved of his going abroad. While he continued at London, waiting for General Oglethorp, he preach|ed more frequently than he had done before, and greater numbers of people flocked to hear him. But finding that the General was not likely to &s;ail for &s;ome time; and being under particular obligations to the Rev. Mr. Samp&s;on Harris, Mini&s;ter at Stone|hou&s;e in Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, he went at his reque&s;t, to &s;upply his charge, till he &s;hould di&s;patch &s;ome affairs in London. There he was very happy in his public mini&s;trations, but e&s;pecially in his retirements, which he u&s;ed afterwards to reflect upon with great &s;atisfac|tion <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Letter xxi.</NOTE>. On Mr. Harris's return, he left Stonehou&s;e, and upon repeated invitations went a &s;econd time to Bri&s;tol, where he preached as u&s;ual about five times a week. Here the multitudes of his hearers &s;till in|crea&s;ed
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>Some hung upon the rails, others climed up the leads of the church, and all together made the church it&s;elf &s;o hot, with their breath, that the &s;team would fall from the pillars like drops of rain.</Q>
<HI>Ibid.</HI></P></NOTE>. He was attended by per&s;ons of all ranks
<PB N="35" REF="013298_0035_0F904F5CED78EE20">
and denominations; private religious &s;ocieties were erected; a collection for the poor pri&s;oners in New|gate, was made twice or thrice a week; and large encouragement was offered to him, if he would not go abroad.&mdash;During his &s;tay at Bri&s;tol, which was from the end of May to the twenty-fir&s;t of June, he paid a &s;econd &s;hort vi&s;it to Bath, were the people crowded, and were &s;eriou&s;ly affected as at Bri&s;tol, and not le&s;s than 160<HI>l.</HI> was collected for the poor of Geor|gia.</P>
<P>June 21, he preached his farewell-&s;ermon at Bri&s;|tol; and towards the end of the di&s;cour&s;e, when he came to tell them, "it might be they would &s;ee him no more," the whole congregation was exceed|ingly affected; high and low, young and old, bur&s;t into a flood of tears. Multitudes, after &s;ermon, fol|lowed him home weeping; and the next day he was employed from &s;even in the morning till midnight, in talking and giving advice to tho&s;e who came to him, about the concerns of their &s;ouls and &s;alvation.</P>
<P>From Bri&s;tol he went to Glouce&s;ter, and preached to a very crowded auditory; and after &s;taying a few days went to Oxford, where he had an agreeable in|terview with the Methodi&s;ts, and came to London about the end of Augu&s;t.</P>
<P>Here he was invited to preach and a&s;&s;i&s;t in admi|ni&s;tering the Sacrament in a great many churches. The congregations continually increa&s;ed; and gene|rally on the Lord's-days, he u&s;ed to preach four times to very large and very much affected auditories, and to walk ten or twelve miles in going to the different churches. His friends began to be afraid he would hurt him&s;elf; but he u&s;ed to &s;ay,
<Q>He found by experience, the more he did, the more he might do for God.</Q></P>
<P>His name was now put into the news-papers, (though without his con&s;ent or knowledge) as a young Gentleman going volunteer to Georgia, who
<PB N="36" REF="013298_0036_0F904F5DD3AEB628">
was to preach before the &s;ocieties at their general quarterly meeting. This &s;tirred up the people's cu|rio&s;ity more and more. He preached on that occa|&s;ion, his &s;ermon on <HI>Early Piety,</HI> which was printed at the reque&s;t of the &s;ocieties. After this, for near three months &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, there was no end of peo|ple's flocking to hear him, and the managers of the charity &s;chools were continually applying to him to preach <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Letter xxviii.</NOTE> for the benefit of the children; for that purpo&s;e they procured the liberty of the churches on other days of the week be&s;ides the Lord's-day; and yet thou&s;ands went away from the large&s;t churches, not being able to get in. The congregations were all attention, and &s;eemed to hear as for eternity. He preached generally nine times a week, and often ad|mini&s;tered the Sacrament early on the Lord's-day morning, when you might &s;ee the &s;treets filled with people going to church with lanthorns in their hands, and hear them conver&s;ing about the things of God.</P>
<P>As his popularity increa&s;ed, oppo&s;ition increa&s;ed proportionably. Some of the clergy became angry; two of them &s;ent for him, and told him, they would not let him preach in their pulpits any more, unle&s;s he renounced that part of the preface of his &s;ermon on <HI>Regeneration,</HI> (lately publi&s;hed) wherein he wi&s;h|ed
<Q>that his brethren would entertain their audi|tories oftener with di&s;cour&s;es upon the new-birth.</Q>
Probably &s;ome of them were irritated the more, by his free conver&s;ation with many of the &s;erious Di&s;&s;enters, who invited him to their hou&s;es, and repeatedly told him,
<Q>That if the doctrines of the new-birth, and ju&s;tification by faith, were preached powerfully in the churches, there would be few Di&s;&s;enters in England.</Q>
Nor was he without oppo&s;ition even from &s;ome of his friends. But under the&s;e di&s;courage|ments, he had great comfort in meeting every even|ing with a band of religious intimates, to &s;pend an hour in prayer, for the advancement of the Go&s;pel,
<PB N="37" REF="013298_0037_0F904F5E90EFE830">
and for all their acquaintance, &s;o far as they knew their circum&s;tances. In this he had uncommon &s;atisfaction: once he &s;pent a whole night with them in prayer and prai&s;e; and &s;ometimes at midnight, af|ter he had been quite wearied with the labours of the day, he found his &s;trength renewed in this exerci&s;e, which made him compo&s;e his &s;ermon upon <HI>Interce&s;|&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>The nearer the time of his embarkation approach|ed, the more affectionate and eager the people grew. Thou&s;ands and thou&s;ands of prayers were put up for him. They would run and &s;top him in the alleys of the churches, and follow him with wi&s;hful looks. But above all, it was harde&s;t for him to part with his weeping friends at St. Dun&s;tan's, where he helped to admini&s;ter the Sacrament to them, after &s;pending the night before in prayer: This parting was to him al|mo&s;t in&s;upportable.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> From the Time of his embarking for <HI>GEORGIA,</HI> to his re-embarking for <HI>ENGLAND, 1738.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN the latter end of December, 1737, he embark|ed for Georgia<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here begins a Manu&s;cript of Mr. Whitefield's, from which &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages are taken in the following account. It is referred to by M. S.</NOTE>. This was to him a new, and at fir&s;t appearance, a very unpromi&s;ing &s;cene. The &s;hip was full of &s;oldiers, and there were near twenty women among them. The Captains, both of the &s;ol|diers
<PB N="38" REF="013298_0038_0F904F5F3A0086A8">
and &s;ailors, with the &s;urgeon, and a young cadet, gave him &s;oon to under&s;tand, that they looked upon him as an impo&s;tor, and for a while treated him as &s;uch. The fir&s;t Lord's day, one of them played on the hautboy, and nothing was to be &s;een but cards, and little heard but cur&s;ing and bla&s;phemy. This was a very di&s;agreeable &s;ituation; but it is worth while to ob&s;erve, with what prudence he was helped to behave among them, and how God was plea&s;ed to ble&s;s his patient and per&s;evering endeavours to do them good.</P>
<P>He began with the officers in the cabin, in the way of mild and gentle reproof; but this had little ef|fect.
<Q>I could do no more for a &s;ea&s;on, than whil&s;t I was writing, now and then turn my head by way of reproof, to a Lieutenant of the &s;oldiers, who &s;wore as though he was born of a &s;wearing con&s;ti|tution. Now, and then, he would take the hint, return my nod with a, <HI>Doctor I a&s;k your par|don,</HI> and then to his cards and &s;wearing again<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. S.</NOTE>.</Q>
He therefore tried what might be done between decks, among the &s;oldiers. And though the place was not very commodious, he read prayers and expounded twice a day. At fir&s;t he could not &s;ee any fruit of his labour, yet it was encouraging to find it &s;o kindly received by his new red-coat pari&s;hioners, (as he calls them) many of whom &s;ubmitted cheer|fully to be catechi&s;ed about the le&s;&s;ons they had heard expounded.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation things continued for &s;ome time. But all this while, he had no place for retirement, and there was no divine &s;ervice in the great cabin, both which he greatly de&s;ired. At la&s;t he obtained his wi&s;h: one day finding the &s;hip Captain a little inclined to favour him, he a&s;ked him to &s;uffer him now and then to retire into the round-hou&s;e, where the Captain &s;lept, and offered him money for the loan
<PB N="39" REF="013298_0039_0F904F60193F9F80">
of it. The Captain would not take the money, but readily granted his reque&s;t. Soon afterwards, the military Captain, having invited him to a di&s;h of cof|fee, he took the liberty to tell him,
<Q>That though he was a volunteer on board, yet as he was on board, he looked upon him&s;elf as his Chaplain, and as &s;uch, he thought it a little odd, to pray and preach to the &s;ervants, and not to the ma&s;ter;</Q>
and added withal,
<Q>That if he thought proper, he would make u&s;e of a &s;hort collect now and then, to him, and the other Gentlemen in the great cabin.</Q>
After pau&s;ing a while, and &s;haking his head, he an|&s;wered,
<Q>I think we may, when we have nothing el&s;e to do.</Q>
This aukward hint was all he got for the pre&s;ent; yet he was encouraged thereby to hope, that the de&s;ired point would &s;oon be gained.</P>
<P>They were detained in the Downs, by contrary winds, for near a month; the &s;oldiers on board be|came by this time more and more civilized, and the people at Deal heard him gladly. There he preach|ed thrice, at the invitation of the Mini&s;ters, and often expounded in the hou&s;e where he lodged. This work was very delightful to him; but he was &s;udden|ly called away by a fair wind, about the end of Janu|ary, 1738, ju&s;t after he had preached in Upper-Deal church.</P>
<P>Being returned to the &s;hip, he began to comfort him&s;elf with &s;ome promi&s;ing appearances of doing good in the great cabin. As he had no better place, he generally every night retired with his friend Mr. Haber&s;ham, and his brother, and two &s;ervants, be|hind the round-hou&s;e, for prayer and other religious exerci&s;es. Sometimes, he perceived Captain Whit|ing was hearkening within. One day finding on the Captain's pillow the Independent Whig, he exchang-it for a book entitled, <HI>The Self-Deceiper.</HI> Next morning the Captain came &s;miling, and en|quired who made that exchange; Mr. Whitefield
<PB N="40" REF="013298_0040_0F904F60C0C766E0">
confe&s;&s;ed the charge, and begged his acceptance of the book, which he &s;aid he had read, and liked very well. From thenceforward, a vi&s;ible alteration was &s;een in him. The other Captain al&s;o, about the &s;ame time, met him as he was coming from between decks, and de&s;ired,
<Q>that they might have public &s;ervice and expounding twice a-day in the great cabin.</Q></P>
<P>In about a fortnight, they reached Gibraltar, whither they were bound to take in &s;ome more &s;oldiers. There, one Major Sinclair had been &s;o kind as to provide a lodging for him una&s;ked, who, with the other military Gentlemen, even Go|vernor Sabine, and General Columbine, received him mo&s;t courteou&s;ly. Being apprehen&s;ive, that at a public military table, he might be more than ho&s;|pitably entertained, by way of prevention, he begged leave to remind his Excellency of an ob|&s;ervation made in the book of E&s;ther, on the Court of the great Aha&s;uerus, "That none did compel." He took the hint, and genteely replied,
<Q>That no compul&s;ion of any kind &s;hould be u&s;ed at his table.</Q>
And every thing was carried on with great decorum. The officers attended at public wor|&s;hip with order and gravity; the Mini&s;ters al&s;o be|haved with great civility; and all concurred to give him invitations to preach, which he did twice or thrice in the week:
<Q>Strange and unu&s;ual was the &s;cene, both with re&s;pect to the place and people. The adjacent promontories, and the largene&s;s of the rock of Gibraltar, helped me to enlarge any ideas of him, who in <HI>his &s;trength &s;etteth fa&s;t the mountains, and is girded about with power.</HI> And the place being, as it were, a public rendezvous of all nations, I thought I &s;aw the world in epi|tome<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. S.</NOTE>.</Q>
In the evenings and mornings, when on board, he expounded, conver&s;ed and prayed
<PB N="41" REF="013298_0041_0F904F6179F6C690">
with a religious &s;ociety of &s;oldiers, who had liberty from the Governor to a&s;&s;emble at any time in the church. His evening expo&s;itions were attended, not only by the &s;oldiers, but by officers, Mini&s;ters and town's-people; and from all that could be judged, his labours were not without the divine ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>Finding another &s;ociety of religious &s;oldiers there, belonging to the church of Scotland, he &s;ent them, as well as the former, &s;ome proper books, talked with &s;everal of them, and endeavoured to unite both &s;oci|eties together; urging on them the nece&s;&s;ity of a catholic, di&s;intere&s;ted love, and of joining in prayer for the advancement of the kingdom of Chri&s;t. This exhortation al&s;o, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, had a good effect; and two or three of the latter &s;ociety being draughted out for Georgia, de&s;ired leave to go in the &s;hip with Mr. Whitefield, which was readily al|lowed them.</P>
<P>Before the embarkation of the &s;oldiers, by the Ge|neral's con&s;ent, he gave them a parting di&s;cour&s;e in the church. And after embarkation, from time to time, as the weather permitted, he preached to them on board their re&s;pective &s;hips <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He not only preached to them; but gave them notice, that he intended &s;peaking to them, one by one, to &s;ee what account they could give of their faith.&mdash;<HI>Ibid.</HI> At this time he began his
<Q>Ob&s;erva|tion on &s;elect pa&s;&s;ages of Scripture turned into catechetical que&s;tions,</Q>
printed in vol IV. of his works.</NOTE>. Colonel Cochran, who commanded, was extremely civil: and &s;oon after their &s;etting &s;ail, there was &s;uch a change upon Cap|tain Mackay, that he de&s;ired Mr. Whitefield would not give him&s;elf the trouble of expounding and praying in the cabin, and between decks; for he would order a drum to be beat morning and evening, and him&s;elf would attend with the &s;oldiers on the
<PB N="42" REF="013298_0042_0F904F6231DD6568">
deck. This produced a very agreeable alteration; they were now as regular as in a church. Mr. Whitefield preached with a Captain on each &s;ide of him, and &s;oldiers all around; and the two other &s;hips companies, being now in the trade winds, drew near, and joined in the wor&s;hip of God. The great cabin was now become a-Bethel; both Captains were daily more and more affected; and a crucified Sa|viour, and the things pertaining to the kingdom of God, were the u&s;ual topics of their conver&s;ation. Once after public &s;ermon, Captain Mackay de&s;ired the &s;oldiers to &s;top, whil&s;t he informed them, that to his great &s;hame, he had been a notorious &s;wearer him&s;elf, but by the in&s;trumentality of that Gentle|man, pointing to Mr. Whitefield, he had now left it off, and exhorted them, for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, that they would go and do likewi&s;e. The children were cate|chi&s;ed; there was a reformation throughout the &s;ol|diery. The women cried,
<Q>What a change in our Captain.</Q>
The bad books and packs of cards which Mr. Whitefield exchanged for Bibles, and other religious books (abundance of which were given him to di&s;per&s;e by the <HI>Society for promoting Chri&s;tian knowledge</HI>) were now thrown overboard; and a fever, that prevailed in general through the whole &s;hip, helped to make the impre&s;&s;ions &s;ink deeper. For many days and nights, he vi&s;ited betwixt twenty and thirty &s;ick per&s;ons, crawling between decks upon his knees, admini&s;tring medicines or cordials to them, and &s;uch advice as &s;eemed &s;uitable to their circum&s;tances. The &s;ailors did not e&s;cape the fever; Captain Whiting gladly went with him to vi&s;it them. One of them in particular, who had been a mo&s;t notorious &s;coffer, &s;ent for him in a bitter agony, crying out upon, and lamenting his wicked life. The cadet, who was a cabin pa&s;&s;enger, being al&s;o &s;eized, was wounded deeply, told Mr. Whitefield the hi&s;tory of his life, and informed Captain Mackay of his de&s;ire to leave
<PB N="43" REF="013298_0043_0F904F62E760DF20">
the army, and to return to his original intention (hav|ing had an univer&s;ity education) of devoting him&s;elf to the &s;ervice of the church of God. Mr. Whitefield him&s;elf was al&s;o &s;eized, but by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, he &s;oon recovered, and was &s;trong enough, in about a week, to come out to the burial of the cook of the &s;hip, who had boa&s;ted,
<Q>That he would be wicked till two years before he died, and then he would be good.</Q>
But he was &s;uddenly taken ill and died in about &s;ix hours<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>This was the only adult, except a &s;oldier (who had killed him&s;elf at Gibraltar by perpetual drinking) that died out of all that were on board.</Q>

<P>It was the beginning of May, when they drew near to land. After preaching his farewell &s;ermon, he ar|rived at the par&s;onage-hou&s;e at Savannah, May 7, 1738, about four months after his fir&s;t embarkation at Deptford.</P>
<P>Upon this voyage (many years after) he made the following reflection:
<Q>A long, and, I tru&s;t, not al|together unprofitable voyage. What &s;hall I render to the Lord for all his mercies? Be&s;ides being &s;trengthened to go through my public work, I was enabled to write letters and compo&s;e &s;ermons, as though I had been on land. Even at this di&s;tance of time, the remembrance of the happy hours I enjoyed in religious exerci&s;es on the deck, is re|fre&s;hing to my &s;oul. And though nature &s;ome|times relented at being taken away from my friends, and little unu&s;ual inconveniences of a &s;ea-life; yet, a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that I had in view the glory of God, and the good of &s;ouls, from time to time af|forded me un&s;peakable &s;atisfaction <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">M. S.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>One Mr. Delamot, who had gone volunteer with Mr. We&s;ley, and was left behind by him as &s;chool|ma&s;ter
<PB N="44" REF="013298_0044_0F904F63A45F14B8">
at Savannah, received Mr. Whitefield at the par&s;onage-hou&s;e, which he found much better than expectation. Here &s;ome &s;erious per&s;ons, the fruits of Mr. We&s;ley's mini&s;try, &s;oon came to &s;ee him. On the morrow he read prayers, and expounded in the court hou&s;e, and waited upon the magi&s;trates; but be|ing taken ill, he was confined for above a week with a fever and ague.</P>
<P>When he was recovered, and able to look about him, he found every thing bore the a&s;pect of an in|fant colony: and, what was more di&s;couraging &s;till, he &s;aw it was likely to continue &s;o, by the very na|ture of its con&s;titution.
<Q>The people (&s;ays he) were denied the u&s;e both of rum and &s;laves. The lands were allotted them, according to a particular plan, whether good or bad; and the female heirs prohibited from inheriting. So that in reality, to place people there on &s;uch a footing, was little better than to tie their legs and bid them walk. The &s;cheme was well meant at home; but, as too many years experience evidently proved, was ab&s;o|lutely impracticable in &s;o hot a country abroad. However, that rendered what I had brought over from my friends, more acceptable to the poor in|habitants, and gave me an occular demon&s;tration, which was what I wanted, when the hint was given <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>It was fir&s;t propo&s;ed to me by my dear friend Mr. Charles We&s;ley, who, with General Ogle|thorpe, had concerted a &s;cheme for carrying o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;uch a de&s;ign, before I had any thoughts of going abroad my&s;elf.</Q>

The Saltzburgers at Ebenezer, I found had one; and having heard and read of what Profe&s;&s;or Franck had done in that way in Germany, I confidently
<PB N="45" REF="013298_0045_0F904F646711C138">
hoped that &s;omething of the like nature might be owned and &s;ucceeded in Georgia. Many poor or|phans were there already, and the number was likely &s;oon to increa&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><Q>As opportunity offered, I vi&s;ited Frederica, and the adjacent villages, and often admired, con&s;ider|ing the circum&s;tances and di&s;po&s;ition of the fir&s;t &s;ettlers, that &s;o much was really done. The &s;ettlers were chiefly broken and decayed trade&s;men from London and other parts of England; and &s;everal Scotch adverturers; &s;ome Highlanders, who had a worthy Mini&s;ter, named Maclcod; a few Moravi|ans; and the Saltzburghers, who were by far the mo&s;t indu&s;trious of the whole. With the worthy mini&s;ters of Ebenezer, Me&s;&s;rs. Grenaw and Bolt|zius, I contracted an intimacy. Many praying people were in the congregation, which, with the con&s;ideration that &s;o many charitable people in England had been &s;tirred up to contribute to Geor|gia, and &s;uch faithful labourers as Me&s;&s;rs. We&s;leys and Ingham had been &s;ent, gave me great hopes, that, unpromi&s;ing as the a&s;pect at pre&s;ent might be, the colony might emerge in time out of its in|fant &s;tate. Some &s;mall advances Mr. Ingham had made towards converting the Indians, who were at a &s;mall &s;ettlement about four miles from Savan|nah. He went and lived among them for a few months, and began to compo&s;e an Indian gram|mar; but he was &s;oon called away to England; and the Indians (who were only &s;ome run-away Creeks) were in a few years &s;cattered or dead. Mr. Charles We&s;ley had chiefly acted as Secretary to General Oglethorpe, but he &s;oon al&s;o went to Eng|land to engage more labourers; and not long af|ter, his brother, Mr. John We&s;ley, having met with unworthy treatment, both at Frederica and Georgia, &s;oon followed. All this I was apprized of, but think it mo&s;t prudent not to repeat grie|vances.
<PB N="46" REF="013298_0046_0F904F6526E945F0">
Through divine mercy, I met with re|&s;pectful treatment from magi&s;trates, officers and people. The fir&s;t I vi&s;ited now and then, the others, be&s;ides preaching twice a day, and four times of a Lord's day, I vi&s;ited from hou&s;e to hou&s;e: I was, in general, mo&s;t cordially received; but from time to time found, that <HI>Coelum non ani|mum mutant, qui trans mare currunt</HI>: Though lowered in their circum&s;tances, a &s;en&s;e of what they formerly were in their native country, remained. It was plain to be &s;een, that coming over was not &s;o much out of choice, as con&s;traint: choo&s;ing ra|ther to be poor in an unknown country abroad, than beholden to relations, or live among tho&s;e who knew them in more affluent circum&s;tances at home. Among &s;ome of the&s;e, the event however proved, that the word took effectual root. I was really happy in my little foreign cure, and could have cheerfully remained among them, had I not been obliged to return to England, to receive prie&s;t's orders, and make a beginning towards lay|ing a foundation to the Orphan-hou&s;e. And thus the place I intended to hide my&s;elf in, became, through my being obliged to return for the&s;e pur|po&s;es a means of increa&s;ing that popularity which was already begun, but which by me was ab&s;o|lutely unfor&s;een, and as ab&s;olutely unde&s;ign|ed. During my &s;tay there, the weather was mo&s;t inten&s;ely hot, &s;ometimes burning me almo&s;t through my &s;hoes. Seeing others do it who were as unable, I determined to enure my&s;elf to hardine&s;s, by lying con&s;tantly on the ground; which by u&s;e, I found to be &s;o far from being a hard&s;hip, that afterwards it became &s;o, to lie on a bed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M.

The inhabitants &s;eemed at his fir&s;t coming up to de&s;pi&s;e his youth; but their countenances were altered before wor&s;hip was over. Mr. Garden thanked him mo&s;t cordially, and apprized him of the ill treatment Mr. We&s;ley had met with in Georgia, and a&s;&s;ured him, that were the &s;ame arbitrary proceedings to commence again&s;t him, he would defend him with his life and fortune. He al&s;o &s;aid &s;omething about the colony of Georgia that much encouraged him, as if he thought its flouri&s;hing was not very far off; and that Charle&s;town was fifteen times bigger now, than when he (Mr. Garden) fir&s;t came there.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> From his Embarkation at <HI>CHARLESTOWN</HI> for <HI>LON|DON,</HI> to his preaching fir&s;t in <HI>MOREFIELDS, 1739.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SEPTEMBER 6, 1738, Mr. Whitefield em|barked in a &s;hip bound from Charle&s;town to London. They had a very uncomfortable pa&s;&s;age, for near a fortnight, they were beat about not far from the bar; they were &s;oon reduced to an allowance of water; and the &s;hip it&s;elf was quite out of repair. They were al&s;o very poorly off for provi&s;ions. When they were about a third part of their pa&s;&s;age, they met with a Jamaica man who had plenty of every thing. He &s;ent for Mr. Whitefield on board, and offered him a mo&s;t commodious birth; but he did not think it right to leave his &s;hip-mates in di&s;tre&s;s, and therefore returned to his own &s;hip, with &s;uch things as they were plea&s;ed to give him. The remaining part of the voyage was &s;till more perilous. The only thing comfortable, was, that in the mid&s;t of the&s;e trials, deep impre&s;&s;ions were made on &s;ome that were on board. All con&s;tantly attended public wor&s;hip twice and &s;ome thrice a day. Once the Captain cried out,
<Q>Lord, break this hard heart of mine.</Q>
Others were impre&s;&s;ed: particularly one Captain Gladman a pa&s;&s;enger, on whom a great change was wrought, and afterwards, at his own earne&s;t reque&s;t, became Mr. Whitefield's fellow-tra|veller. At length, after nine weeks to&s;&s;ing and beat|ing to and fro they found them&s;elves in Limerick harbour.
<Q>I wi&s;h I could never forget what I felt, when water and other provi&s;ions were brought us from a&s;hore. One Mr. MacMahon, a country gentleman came from his &s;eat at midnight on pur|po&s;e

<P>At Limerick, Bi&s;hop Bur&s;cough received him very kindly, and engaged him to preach in the ca|thedral, the good effects of which he heard of many years after. From thence he went to Dublin, where he preached, and was courteou&s;ly received by Dr. Delany, Bi&s;hop Rundel, and Archbi&s;hop Bolton, who had heard of him from a gentleman of Gibraltar. And after a pa&s;&s;age of twenty-four hours from Du|blin, he arrived at Park-gate, Thur&s;day, November 30, preached twice on the Lord's-day at Manche|&s;ter, and came to London the Friday following, December 8.</P>
<P>Here, he had a conference with the Moravian bre|thren, who were lately come to London; and tho' he could not directly fall in with their way of expre&s;&s;ing them&s;elves, yet he heartily agreed with them in the old Prote&s;tant Doctrine of Ju&s;tification in the &s;ight of God, by Faith alone in the imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t; and was not a little delighted to find a great increa&s;e of the work of God, both as to light and love, doctrine and practice, through the in&s;tru|mentality of Mr. Charles, and e&s;pecially of Mr. John We&s;ley.</P>
<P>Some of the clergy now began to &s;hew their di&s;|plea&s;ure more and more; &s;o that in two days time, five churches were denied him. And tho' the Arch|bi&s;hop of Canterbury, and the Bi&s;hop of London, both received him civilly, it was but coldly: And the lat|ter enquired,
<Q>Whether his Journals were not a lit|tle tinctured with enthu&s;ia&s;m?</Q>
He replied, That they were written only for him&s;elf, and private friends and were publi&s;hed entirely without his con&s;ent, or knowledge, or &s;o much as his con&s;ent being a&s;ked at all. It was certainly wrong to publi&s;h them, without
<PB N="50" REF="013298_0050_0F904F6A31E60C40">
his con&s;ent and revi&s;al; otherwi&s;e, the publication of them was a very proper way to prevent the mi&s;repre|&s;entation of facts, either by calumny and detraction on the one hand, or by exaggeration on the other. And it is a great pity he did not continue them. They would have been the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible memoirs of his life. But we &s;ee how the offence given by, or taken at, &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages, might help to determine him
<Q>to pro|ceed (as he afterwards &s;ays) in a more compendious way.</Q>
The Journals were, indeed, mo&s;tly written amid&s;t his ince&s;&s;ant labours in preaching, travelling, and writing a multitude of letters. And the whole was told with that unguarded &s;implicity, which tho' it charms the candid, and di&s;po&s;es them to forgive or overlook many things, yet gives frequent handle to the critical and &s;evere. It mu&s;t al&s;o be owned, that his un&s;u&s;pecting hone&s;ty made him &s;ometimes receive, with too little caution, the characters of per&s;ons and &s;ocieties, from tho&s;e whom he took to be friends of re|ligion, and who, perhaps, were really &s;o, but were mi&s;informed. Being therefore convinced, upon &s;e|cond thoughts, that both his Journals, and the two fir&s;t parts of his Life, needed correction, he promi&s;ed a new edition of them, which he accordingly publi&s;h|ed in 1756. And in the preface he ingenuou&s;ly ac|knowledges,
<Q>That upon a review, he had found many mi&s;takes, (which are now rectified) and many pa&s;&s;ages that were ju&s;tly exceptionable,</Q>
(which are now era&s;ed.) And in a note, upon <HI>September</HI> 24, 1740, he &s;ays,
<Q>In my former Journal, taking things by hear&s;ay too much, I &s;poke and wrote too ra&s;hly, both of the Colleges and Mini&s;ters of <HI>New England;</HI> for which, as I have already done when at Bo&s;ton la&s;t, from the pulpit, I take this opportunity of a&s;king public pardon from the pre&s;s. It was ra&s;h and un|charitable, and though well-meant, I fear, did hurt.</Q>
But the&s;e corrections, while they &s;hew the author's candour and humility, do not affect the hi&s;tory
<PB N="51" REF="013298_0051_0F904F6BB3578630">
of his extraordinary labours and &s;ucce&s;s in the work of the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>The Tru&s;tees for the Colony of Georgia received him more cordially, were plea&s;ed to expre&s;s their &s;atisfaction at the accounts &s;ent them of his conduct, during his &s;tay in the colony, and being reque&s;ted, by letters &s;ent un|known to him, from the Magi&s;trates and Inhabitants, they mo&s;t willingly pre&s;ented him to the Living of Sa|vannah, (though he in&s;i&s;ted upon having no &s;ala|ry) and as readily granted him five hundred acres of land, whereon to erect an Orphan-hou&s;e; to collect money for which, together with taking Prie&s;t's Orders, were the chief motives of his returning to England &s;o &s;oon.</P>
<P>Near a month elap&s;ed, before a board &s;at to make him the&s;e returns. But during that interval, he was not idle. He and his brethren went on in their u&s;ual cour&s;e, taking hold of every opportunity of do|ing good, and preaching occa&s;ionally as churches were allowed them <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>God gave us a mo&s;t plea&s;ant Go&s;pel Chri&s;tmas &s;ea&s;on, and &s;uch a happy beginning of a New-Year as I had never &s;een before.</Q>
M. S.</NOTE>. And tho' the church-wardens and clergy were aver&s;e, yet the common people were rather more eager than ever. But what &s;urprized him mo&s;t was, to &s;ee many of the heads and members of the London Societies, (who, by the accounts given by Dr. Woodward and Horneck <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Dr. Woodward's Account of the Ri&s;e and Pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;s of the Religious Societies in the City of London, &amp;c.</NOTE>, he thought were founded on a good bottom) make &s;uch vir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ut oppo|&s;ition. However, numbers of them were of another mind, and other Societies were &s;oon formed in va|rious parts of the town. A large room in Fetter|lane was the general place of rendezvous, where they had frequent meetings, and great &s;atisfaction in &s;ocial prayer.
<Q>It was a Penteco&s;t &s;ea&s;on indeed. Some|times
<PB N="52" REF="013298_0052_0F904F6BE5510638">
whole nights were &s;pent in prayer. Often have we been filled as with new wine. And often have I &s;een them overwhelmed with the Divine Pre&s;ence, and cry out,
<Q>Will GOD, indeed, dwell with men upon earth! How dreadful is this place! This is no other than the hou&s;e of GOD, and the gate of Heaven!<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. S.</NOTE></Q></Q>
At the &s;ame time, in the churches that were open, the people crowded, and were affected more than ever. And he and his bre|thren were &s;o much engaged, that for &s;ome days he could walk, and preach, and vi&s;it Societies with very little &s;leep, and religious exerci&s;es &s;eemed to be their meat and drink.</P>
<P>January 11, 1739, he &s;et out for Oxford to receive Prie&s;t's Orders from his good friend Bi&s;hop Ben&s;on, which he did the next Lord's-day; and having preached and admini&s;tred the Sacrament at the Ca&s;tle, and preached again in the afternoon, to a crowded congregation, he returned to London, January 15.</P>
<P>As he had collected &s;o much for the Charity &s;chools la&s;t year, he rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;ed that the pulpits would not be denied him for the u&s;e of the Georgia Orphan-hou&s;e this year. But the religious concern advancing, and &s;preading more and more, oppo&s;ition al&s;o increa&s;ed. A pamphlet was publi&s;hed again&s;t his &s;ermon, On Regeneration. Several Clergymen made &s;trong objections again&s;t him and his brethren for expounding in &s;ocieties; and &s;ome people were threatened with pro&s;ecution by their pari&s;h mini&s;ters, for &s;uffering them to expound in their hou&s;es. Yet this did not di&s;courage either preachers or hearers. The more they were oppo&s;ed, the more they were &s;trengthened. New awakenings were heard of in va|rious parts; and, "What &s;hall I do to be &s;aved?" was the repeated que&s;tion of every day.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="013298_0053_0F8FFAD734B7CDC8">All the pulpits were not as yet &s;hut up: Two or three churches were allowed him to preach in, and to collect for the Georgia Orphans, and for erecting a church for the poor Saltzburghers at Ebenezer. One Mr. Broughton behaved nobly on this occa&s;ion. Application being made to him, to deny Mr. Whitefield his pulpit, he an&s;wered,
<Q>Hav|ing got the Lecture&s;hip of St. Helen's by Mr. Whitefield's influence; if he in&s;i&s;ts upon it, he &s;hall have my pulpit.</Q>
Mr. Whitefield did in&s;i&s;t upon it, but (Mr. Broughton lo&s;ing the Lecture&s;hip) he afterwards blamed him&s;elf much for his con|duct.</P>
<P>In Bri&s;tol he had the u&s;e of the churches for two or three Sundays, but &s;oon found they would not be open very long. The Dean was not at home: The Chancellor threatened to &s;ilence and &s;u&s;pend him. In about a fortnight every door was &s;hut, except Newgate, where he preached, and collected for the poor pri&s;oners, and where people thronged, and were much impre&s;&s;ed; but this place, al&s;o was &s;oon &s;hut again&s;t him, by orders from the May|or.</P>
<P>Before his fir&s;t embarkation for Georgia, when he talked of going abroad, numbers in Bri&s;tol u&s;ed to reply,
<Q>What need of going abroad? Have we not Indians enough at home?</Q>
If you have a mind to convert Indians, there are colliers enough in King&s;wood. And before he left London, whil&s;t preaching at Bermond&s;ey Church, and &s;eeing &s;o ma|ny thou&s;ands that could not come in, he had a &s;trong inclination to go out and preach to them (though he then u&s;ed notes) upon one of the tomb|&s;tones in the church-yard. And this he mention|ed to &s;ome friends, who looked upon the motion, at fir&s;t, very unfavourably; yet were willing to take it into farther con&s;ideration. At Bri&s;tol he thought he had a clear call to try this method. The colliers, he
<PB N="54" REF="013298_0054_0F904F6CA54E7210">
had heard, were very rude, and very numerous; &s;o uncultivated, that no body cared to go among them; neither had they any place of wor&s;hip; and often, when provoked, they were a terror to the whole ci|ty of Bri&s;tol. He therefore looked upon the civiliz|ing of the&s;e people; and much more, the bringing of them to the profe&s;&s;ion and practice of chri&s;tianity, as a matter of great importance.
<Q>I thought it might be doing the &s;ervice of my Creator, who had a mountain for his pulpit, and the heavens for a &s;ounding board; and who, when his Go&s;|pel was refu&s;ed by the Jews, &s;et his &s;ervants into the high ways and hedges<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. S.</NOTE>.</Q>
After much prayer, and many &s;truggles with him&s;elf, he one day went to Hannam Mount, and &s;tanding upon a hill, be|gan to preach to about a hundred colliers, upon Matt. v. 1, 2, 3. This &s;oon took air. At the &s;e|cond and third time the numbers greatly increa&s;ed, till the congregation, at a moderate computation, amounted to near twenty thou&s;and. But with what gladne&s;s and eagerne&s;s, many of the&s;e de&s;pi&s;ed out|ca&s;ts, who had never been in a church in their lives, received the word, is above de&s;cription.
<Q>Having (as he writes) no righteou&s;ne&s;s of their own to re|nounce, they were glad to hear of a Je&s;us who was a friend to publicans, and came not to call the righteous, but &s;inners to repentance. The fir&s;t di&s;|covery of their being affected, was to &s;ee the white gutters made by their tears, which plenti|fully fell down their black cheeks, as they came out of the coal pits. Hundreds and hundreds of them were &s;oon brought under deep convictions, which (as the event proved) happily ended in a &s;ound and thorough conver&s;ion. The change was vi&s;ible to all, though numbers cho&s;e to impute it to any thing, rather than the finger of God. As the &s;cene was quite new, and I had
<PB N="55" REF="013298_0055_0F904F6D664349C0">
ju&s;t began to be an extempore preacher, it often occa&s;ioned many inward conflicts. Some|times, when twenty thou&s;and people were before me, I had not, in my own apprehen&s;ion, a word to &s;ay, either to God or them. But I was never totally de&s;erted, and frequently (for to deny it would be lying again&s;t God) &s;o a&s;&s;i&s;ted, that I knew by happy experience, what our Lord meant by &s;aying, <HI>Out of his belly &s;hall flow rivers of liv|ing water.</HI> The open firmament above me, the pro|&s;pect of adjacent fields, with the &s;ight of thou&s;ands, &s;ome in coaches, &s;ome on hor&s;eback and &s;ome in the trees, and at times all affected and drenched in tears together, to which &s;ometimes was added, the &s;olemnity of the approaching evening, was almo&s;t too much for, and quite overcame me<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. S.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>Be&s;ides the colliers, and thou&s;ands from neigh|bouring villages, per&s;ons of all ranks flocked daily out of Bri&s;tol. And he was &s;oon invited to preach, by &s;ome of the better &s;ort, in a large bowling-green in the city it&s;elf. Many indeed &s;neered, to &s;ee a &s;tripling, with a gown, mount a table, upon what they called uncon&s;ecrated ground. And for once, or twice, it excited the contempt and laughter of the higher rank, who formerly were his admirers, when he preached in the churches. But God enabled him to &s;tand the laugh, and to preach the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t with earne&s;tne&s;s and con&s;tancy; and was plea&s;ed to attend it with his ble&s;&s;ing. From all quarters, people flocked under great concern about their &s;ouls. Some|times he was employed almo&s;t from morning to night, giving an&s;wer to tho&s;e who came in great di&s;|tre&s;s, crying out, "What &s;hall we do to be &s;aved?" More a&s;&s;i&s;tance was wanted; he therefore wrote to Mr. John We&s;ley, who had never yet been at Bri&s;tol, and having received a favourable an&s;wer, recommended him and his brother, in the &s;tronge&s;t
<PB N="56" REF="013298_0056_0F8FFAD78A7D7C60">
manner, to the people, and earne&s;tly prayed that the la&s;t might be fir&s;t; for he was determined to pur&s;ue his &s;cheme of the Orphan-hou&s;e, and return again to his retreat at Georgia.</P>
<P>Mr. We&s;ley being come, he took an affectionate leave of his friends at Bri&s;tol, and made a &s;econd ex|cur&s;ion to Wales, where an awakening had begun &s;ome years before, by the in&s;trumentality of the Rev. Mr. Griffith Jones, and was now carried on by the mini&s;try of one Mr. Howel Harris, a layman. They met at Cardiff, and in company with many others went to Hu&s;k, Ponty-pool, Abergavenny, Comiboy, Carleon, Trelex, and Newport, and preached in all the&s;e places, Mr. Whitefield fir&s;t in Engli&s;h, and Mr. Harris afterwards in Welch, to many thou&s;ands. The &s;erious per&s;ons among them, of the Free Grace Di&s;&s;enters, rejoiced; but many of high-flying principles, and of another &s;tamp, were equally enraged, and expre&s;&s;ed their di&s;like by mockings and threats. All the&s;e, however, he was enabled to bear with patience, and without the lea&s;t di&s;couragement.</P>
<P>About the 8th of April, from Wales he went to Glouce&s;ter, the place of his birth, where a church was allowed him for once or twice, but no more. However, he preached frequently in Boothall, (the place where the judges &s;it) and in his brother's field, to many thou&s;ands. At the time of Mr. Whitefield's preaching in Glouce&s;ter, old Mr. Cole, a di&s;&s;enting Mini&s;ter, u&s;ed to &s;ay,
<Q>The&s;e are days of the Son of Man indeed.</Q>
This Mr. Cole, Mr. Whitefield when a boy, was taught to ridicule. And being a&s;ked once by one of his congregation, What bu&s;i|ne&s;s he would be of? He &s;aid,
<Q>A Mini&s;ter; but he would take care never to tell &s;tories in the pulpit like old Cole.</Q>
About twelve years after|wards, the old man hearing him preach, and tell &s;ome &s;tory to illu&s;trate the &s;ubject he was upon,
<PB N="57" REF="013298_0057_0F904F6E29233830">
and having been informed what he had before &s;aid, made this remark to one of his elders,
<Q>I find that young Whitefield can now tell &s;tories, as well as old Cole.</Q>
He was much affected with Mr. Whitefield's preaching, and &s;o humble, that he u&s;ed to &s;ub&s;cribe him&s;elf his curate; and went about preaching after him in the country from place to place. But one evening, whil&s;t preaching, he was &s;truck with death, and then a&s;ked for a chair to lean on, till he concluded his &s;ermon, when he was car|ried up &s;tairs, and died. Mr. Whitefield's reflection upon this (Letter DXXIII.) is,
<Q>O ble&s;&s;ed God! if it be thy holy will, may my exit be like his!</Q></P>
<P>As to Mr. Whitefield's telling &s;tories in the pulpit, &s;ome perhaps may find fault; but be&s;ide, that he had an uncommon fund of pa&s;&s;ages, proper enough to be thus told, and a peculiar talent of telling them; it was certainly, a mean of drawing multitudes to hear him, who would not have attended to the truths of the Go&s;pel, delivered in the ordinary manner.</P>
<P>His concern for his countrymen, his fellow-citi|zens, and his own relations, made him forget all bodi|ly weakne&s;s, (to which about this time he was fre|quently &s;ubject) and readily to comply with invi|tations given to preach at Pain&s;wick, Chaltenham, Eve&s;ham, Bad&s;ey, Strou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, Chafford, places abound|ing with inhabitants, and where there is ground to hope, many received much &s;piritual benefit. To wander thus about from place to place; to &s;tand in bowling-greens, at market-cro&s;&s;es, and in highways, e&s;pecially in his own country, where had he confer|red with fle&s;h and blood, he might have lived at ea&s;e; to be blamed by friends; and have every evil thing &s;poken again&s;t him by his enemies; was (e&s;pecially when his body was weak, and his &s;pirits, low) very trying; but &s;till he was inwardly &s;upported.</P>
<P>April 21. He again went to Oxford, and after &s;taying a few days with the Methodi&s;ts there, came
<PB N="58" REF="013298_0058_0F904F6EE65B4A48">
to London, where he attempted to preach at I&s;lington church, the incumbent, Mr. Stonehou&s;e, being a friend to the Methodi&s;ts; but in the mid&s;t of the prayers, the church-warden came and demanded his licence, or otherwi&s;e he forbad his preaching in that pulpit. He might perhaps have in&s;i&s;ted on his right to preach, yet for peace &s;ake he declined; and after the communion &s;ervice was over, he preached in the church-yard.</P>
<P>Opportunities of preaching in a more regular way being now denied him, and his preaching in the fields being attended with a remarkable ble&s;&s;ing, he judged it his duty to go on in this practice, and ventured the following Sunday into Moorfields. Pub|lic notice having been given, and the thing being new and &s;ingular, upon coming out of the coach, he found an incredible number of people a&s;&s;embled. Many had told him, that he &s;hould never come again out of that place alive. He went in, however, between two of his friends, who, by the pre&s;&s;ure of the crowd, were &s;oon parted entirely from him, and were obliged to leave him to the mercy of the rabble. But the&s;e, in&s;tead of hurting him, formed a lane for him, and car|ried him along to the middle of the Fields, (where a table had been placed, which was broken in pieces by the crowd) and afterwards back again to the wall that then parted the upper and lower Moorfields; from whence he preached without mole&s;tation, to an ex|ceeding great multitude in the lower Fields. Finding &s;uch encouragement, he went that &s;ame evening to Kennington-Common, a large open place, near three miles di&s;tant from London, where he preached to a va&s;t multitude, who were all attention, and behaved with as much regularity and quietne&s;s, as if they had been in a church <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Words cannot well expre&s;s the glorious di&s;|plays of Divine Grace, which we &s;aw, and heard of, and felt.</Q>

<P>FOR &s;everal months after this, Moorfields, Ken|nington-Common, and Blackheath, were the chief &s;cenes of action. At a moderate computation, the auditories often con&s;i&s;ted of above twenty thou|&s;and. It is &s;aid, their &s;inging could be heard two miles off, and his voice near a mile. Sometimes there were upwards of a hundred coaches, be&s;ides waggons, &s;caffolds, and other contrivances, which particular per&s;ons let out for the convenience of the audience. Having no other method to take, he was obliged to collect for the Orphan-hou&s;e in the fields, or not at all, which was humbling to him and his friends, who a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in that work. But the readine&s;s with which the people gave, and the prayers which they put up when throwing in their mites, were very en|couraging <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Once upwards of twenty pounds were collec|ted in halfpence.</Q>
M. S.</NOTE>. In the mean while, Mr. John We&s;ley was labouring with great zeal at Bri&s;tol, his brother Mr. Charles, in London and el&s;ewhere, Mr. Ingham had been preaching in many churches of York&s;hire, Mr. Kinchin in Oxford, and Mr. Rogers in Bed|ford&s;hire. Thus the &s;eed &s;own was gradually increa&s;|ed, and the embargo which was now laid on the &s;hipping, gave him lei&s;ure for more journeys through various parts of England; and God was plea&s;ed to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">wn his labours with amazing &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Some demur happening in Bri&s;tol, he went there a few days; put Mr. John We&s;ley (who had now
<PB N="60" REF="013298_0060_0F904F70AEAC3630">
made a progre&s;s in building the King&s;wood &s;chool, and al&s;o had begun a room at Bri&s;tol) in full power; and took him along with him, and introduced him as a field preacher, at Glouce&s;ter and other places. Eve|ry where the word &s;eemed to &s;ink deeper and deeper into the hearts of the hearers. Singing and praying were heard in King&s;wood, in&s;tead of cur&s;ing and &s;wearing; and in many other places the fruits of righteou&s;ne&s;s evidently appeared.</P>
<P>Many fal&s;e reports were now &s;pread abroad con|cerning him. Not a journey he could make, but he was either killed or wounded, or died &s;uddenly. One groundle&s;s fiction was continually invented after ano|ther. And the Bi&s;hop of London laid hold of this occa&s;ion for publi&s;hing a charge to his clergy, to avoid the extremes of enthu&s;ia&s;m and lukewarmne&s;s. But amid&s;t the&s;e di&s;couragements, he was not left without the countenance and friend&s;hip of &s;everal per&s;ons of influence.</P>
<P>The embargo being taken off, and upwards of a thou&s;and pounds collected for the Orphan-hou&s;e, he &s;ailed the &s;econd time for America, Augu&s;t 14, 1739, with a family con&s;i&s;ting of eight men, one boy, and two children, be&s;ides his friend Mr. Seward.</P>
<P>After a pa&s;&s;age of nine weeks <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For the manner in which he employed his time on board, &s;ee his Journals and Letters of this period.

IV. of his works.</NOTE>, he arrived at Phi|ladelphia in the beginning of November, and was im|mediately invited to preach in the churches, to which people of all denominations thronged, as in England. From thence he was invited to New-York, by Mr. Noble, the only per&s;on with whom he had any ac|quaintance in that part of America. Upon his arri|val,
<PB N="61" REF="013298_0061_0F904F71320C5508">
they waited on the Commi&s;&s;ary; but he refu&s;ed him the u&s;e of his church. Mr. Whitefield, there|fore, preached in the fields, and on the evening of the &s;ame day, to a very thronged and attentive audience in the Rev. Mr. Pemberton's meeting-hou&s;e; and con|tinued to do &s;o twice or thrice a day for above a week; and by all that could be judged, with very great &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>On his way to and from Philadelphia, he al&s;o preached at Elizabeth-Town, Maidenhead, Abingdon, Ne&s;hamini, Burlington, and New-Brun&s;wick, in the New-Jer&s;eys, to &s;ome thou&s;ands gathered from vari|ous parts, among whom there had been a con&s;iderable awakening, by the in&s;trumentality of one Mr. Free|linghau&s;en, a Dutch Mini&s;ter, and the Me&s;&s;rs. Ten|nents, Blair and Rowland. He had al&s;o the plea&s;ure of meeting with old Mr. Tennent, as well as his &s;ons, and with Mr. Dickin&s;on.
<Q>Mr. Tennent, and his brethren in pre&s;bytery, intend breeding up gracious youths for our Lord's vineyard. The place where|in the young men &s;tudy now, is a log-hou&s;e, about twenty feet long, and near as many broad. From this de&s;pi&s;ed place, &s;even or eight worthy Mi|ni&s;ters of Je&s;us have lately been &s;ent forth, and a foundation is now laying for the in&s;truction of ma|ny others. The work, I am per&s;uaded, is of God, and therefore will not come to nought<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Journals, Nov. 22, 1739.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>The event has verified his judgment about this in|&s;titution. It is now a large College at Princeton in New-Jer&s;eys; and has already had many worthy Pre|&s;idents, (&s;ome of who&s;e names are well known in the learned world) &s;uch as Mr. Dickin&s;on, Mr. Burr, Mr. Jonathan Edwards, Mr. Samuel Davies, Dr. Finley, and at pre&s;ent Dr. Wither&s;poon, by who&s;e abilities, care, and activity, it is, under Providence, in a very flouri&s;hing condition.</P>
<P>And there has been lately, (&s;ummer 1770) a re|markable revival of religion among the &s;tudents, both in the college and grammar &s;chool.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="013298_0062_0F904F71E5395F88">It was no le&s;s plea&s;ing than &s;trange to him, to &s;ee &s;uch gatherings in a foreign land; Mini&s;ters and peo|ple &s;hedding tears; &s;inners &s;truck with awe; and &s;e|rious per&s;ons, who had been much run down and de|&s;pi&s;ed, filled with joy. Mean time, the Orphan-hou&s;e affairs went on well. The things brought from Eng|land, were &s;old for their benefit. A &s;loop was pur|cha&s;ed, of which Captain Gladman was ma&s;ter; and a young man, who had lately received &s;erious impre&s;|&s;ions under Mr. Whitefield's preaching, willingly offered him&s;elf as mate. Many little pre&s;ents were made to his family for &s;ea &s;tores, and the intended hou&s;e. And about the end of November, he took his leave of his family, and ordered them to proceed in their voyage to Savannah, while him&s;elf, with Mr. Seward and two more, determined to go thither by land.</P>
<P>Numbers followed, &s;ome twenty, &s;ome &s;ixty miles out from Philadelphia. He preached at Che&s;ter, Wilmington, Newca&s;tle, (where he was met on the way by Mr. Ro&s;s, Mini&s;ter of the place) Chri&s;tian-Bridge, and Whitely-Creek, where Mr. William Tennent (who&s;e meeting-hou&s;e is in the neighbour|hood) had erected a tent for him. Here he ob&s;erved new &s;cenes of field-preaching, or rather preaching in the woods, opened to him. At Whitely-Creek, perhaps the congregation did not con&s;i&s;t of le&s;s than ten thou&s;and. Earne&s;t invitations were given him to come and preach el&s;ewhere; which he had great en|couragement to do, from the vi&s;ible &s;ucce&s;s of his la|bours; but he ha&s;ted to be with his family at Savan|nah.</P>
<P>In his way thither, he al&s;o preached in Maryland, at North-Ea&s;t and Joppa, and at Annapolis, the ca|pital, where he was received with much civility by the Governor; and at Upper-Marlborough.</P>
<P>In Virginia al&s;o, he preached at William&s;burgh, where he was courteou&s;ly received by the Governor,
<PB N="63" REF="013298_0063_0F904F730A5051E0">
and by Mr. Blair the Commi&s;&s;ary, whom he &s;peaks of with great regard.</P>
<P>When he came to North-Carolina, he thought it &s;eemed to be the greate&s;t wa&s;te, and the mo&s;t uncul|tivated of &s;pots, both in a temporal and &s;piritual &s;en&s;e. Yet here, in a place called Newburn-Town, his preaching was attended with an uncommon in|fluence. And it was not without effect at Newton on Cape-Fear River, where were many from Scot|land among&s;t the congregation, who had lately come over to &s;ettle in North-Carolina.</P>
<P>Immediately on coming into South-Carolina pro|vince, (he &s;ays) a vi&s;ible change was ob&s;ervable in the manners of the people. And when he came to Charle&s;town, (which was on Saturday, January 3, 1740) he could &s;carce believe but he was among&s;t Londonners, both in re&s;pect of gaiety of dre&s;s, and politene&s;s of manners.</P>
<P>Here he &s;oon perceived, that by field-preaching he had lo&s;t his old friend the Commi&s;&s;ary, who once promi&s;ed to defend him with life and fortune. How|ever, at the reque&s;t of the Independent Mini&s;ter, (who continued his friend to his dying day) he preached in his meeting-hou&s;e. At the fir&s;t &s;ermon, all was gay and trifling, no impre&s;&s;ion &s;eemingly made at all. But next morning in the French church, the &s;cene was quite altered. A vi&s;ible, and almo&s;t uni|ver&s;al concern appeared. Many of the inhabitants earne&s;tly de&s;ired him to give them one &s;ermon more; for which purpo&s;e he was prevailed upon to put off his journey till the next day; and there was rea&s;on to think his &s;tay was not in vain.</P>
<P>Next morning, he and his companions &s;et out in an open canoe for Savannah; and in their way, for the fir&s;t time, lay in the woods, upon the ground, near a large fire, which keeps off the wild bea&s;ts; upon which he makes this reflection,
<Q>An emblem,
<PB N="64" REF="013298_0064_0F904F73D50B7F38">
I thought, of the divine love and pre&s;ence keeping off evils and corruptions from the &s;oul <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. S.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>On his arrival at Savannah, January 11, he was very happy to meet his family, who had got there three weeks before him; and to find by letters from England, New-York, &amp;c. that the work of God pro|&s;pered. But it was a melancholy thing to &s;ee the colony of Georgia reduced even to a much lower ebb than when he left it, and almo&s;t de&s;erted by all but &s;uch as could not well go away. Employing the&s;e, therefore, he thought would be of &s;ingular &s;ervice, and the money expended, might be al&s;o a means of keeping them in the colony.</P>
<P>Before his arrival, Mr. Haber&s;ham had pitched upon a plot of ground for the Orphan-hou&s;e, of 500 acres, about ten miles from Savannah, and had already begun to clear and &s;tock it. The orphans, in the mean time, were accommodated in a hired hou&s;e. On this, many years after, he makes the following reflections:
<Q>Had I proceeded according to the rules of prudence, I &s;hould have fir&s;t cleared the land, built the hou&s;e, and then taken in the orphans; but I found their condition &s;o pitiable, and the inhabitants &s;o poor, that I immediately opened an infirmary, hired a large hou&s;e at a great rent, and took in at different times, twenty-four orphans. To all this I was encouraged, by the example of Profe&s;&s;or Franck. But I forgot to re|collect, that Profe&s;&s;or Franck built in Glaucha, in a populous country, and that I was building in the very tail of the world, where I could not expect the lea&s;t &s;upply, and which the badne&s;s of its con|&s;titution, which every day I expected would be al|tered, rendered by far the mo&s;t expen&s;ive part of all his Maje&s;ty's dominions. But had I received more and ventured le&s;s, I &s;hould have &s;uffered le&s;s, and others more <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. S.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="013298_0065_0F904F751C00E648">The fir&s;t collection he made in America, was at the Rev. Mr. Smith's meeting-hou&s;e in Charle&s;town, whither he went about the middle of March, to &s;ee his brother, the Captain of a &s;hip from England. He was de&s;ired by &s;ome of the inhabitants, to &s;peak in behalf of the poor orphans; and the collection amounted to &s;eventy pounds &s;terling. This was no &s;mall encouragement to him at that time, e&s;pecially as he had rea&s;on to think it came from tho&s;e who had received &s;piritual benefit by his mini&s;trations.</P>
<P>Having returned to Savannah, he went to the &s;pot of ground, where he intended the Orphan-hou&s;e &s;hould be built, and upon the 25th day of March, 1740, laid the fir&s;t brick of the great hou&s;e, which he called <HI>Bethe&s;da,</HI> i. e. <HI>a hou&s;e of mercy.</HI> Long af|ter this he writes,

By this time, near forty children were taken in, to be provided with food and raiment; and counting the workmen and all, he had near a hundred to be daily fed.

<P>MR. Whitefield again, therefore, &s;et off in a &s;loop for Newca&s;tle in Penn&s;ylvania, where he arrived about the middle of April. In this &s;hort pa&s;|&s;age of ten days, he was much di&s;couraged both by weakne&s;s of body, and low &s;pirits. But, as he ob|&s;erved afterwards, Providence was infinitely better to him than his fears, and exceeded his mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations. For during the &s;pace of two months, he was &s;trengthened to preach, generally twice, and fre|quently, be&s;ides travelling, thrice a day. At Phila|delphia, the churches were no longer allowed him; but he preached in the fields to congregations that con&s;i&s;ted &s;ometimes of near ten thou&s;and, and with great apparent &s;ucce&s;s.

<P>At New-York, New-Brun&s;wick, Statten-I&s;land, Ba&s;kenridge, Whitely-Creek, Frogs-Manor, Reedy-I&s;land, there was great concern upon the minds both of the preacher and hearers.</P>

<P>In a journal written by Mr. William Seward, (Mr. Whitefield's companion in travel) we have the follow|ing particulars belonging to this period.</P>
<P>April 9, 1740. Mr. Whitefield propo&s;ed my go|ing to England upon &s;everal important affairs, par|ticularly to bring over Mr. Hutchins to take care of the Orphan-hou&s;e in his ab&s;ence&mdash;To acquaint the Tru&s;tees of Georgia with the &s;tate of the colony, and the means, under God, for the better e&s;tabli&s;hment thereof, it being now upheld al|mo&s;t wholly by the &s;oldiery and Orphan-hou&s;e, mo&s;t of the people who are unconcerned in either, being gone or going&mdash;The proper means are principally three, 1. An allowance of negroes. 2. A free title to the lands. 3. An independent magi&s;tracy, <HI>viz.</HI> &s;uch as are able and willing to &s;erve without fee or reward. My bu&s;ine&s;s with the Tru&s;tees will be farther, to bring over the money, lodged in their hands for building the church at Savannah. I am, moreover, to collect &s;ub&s;criptions for a Negroe &s;chool in Penn&s;ylvania, where our brother Whitefield propo&s;es to take up land, in order to &s;ettle a town for the reception of &s;uch Engli&s;h friends, who&s;e hearts God &s;hall in|cline to come and &s;ettle there.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="013298_0068_0F904F794E2E7E40">April 13. Mr. Tennent informed us of the great &s;ucce&s;s which had attended our brother Whitefield's preaching, when here la&s;t. For &s;ome time, a general &s;ilence was fixed by the Lord on people's minds, and many began &s;eriou&s;ly to think on what foundation they &s;tood&mdash;A general out|ward reformation has been vi&s;ible. Many mini&s;ters have been quickened in their zeal to preach the word in &s;ea&s;on and out of &s;ea&s;on. Congregations are increa&s;ed, and &s;ome few, it is hoped, will be brought, through their convictions, into a &s;ound and &s;aving conver&s;ion.</P>
<P>April 14. Mr. Jones, the Bapti&s;t mini&s;ter, told us of two other mini&s;ters, Mr. Treat and Mr. Morgan, who were &s;o affected with our brother Whitefield's &s;pirit, that the latter had gone forth, preaching the glad tidings of &s;alvation, towards the &s;ea-coa&s;t in the Jer&s;eys, and many other places which lay in darkne&s;s and the &s;hadow of death. The former told his congregation, that he had been hitherto deceiving him&s;elf and them; and that he could not preach to them at pre&s;ent, but de&s;ired they would join in prayer with him.</P>
<P>April 15. We were informed, that an Indian trader was &s;o affected with brother Whitefield's doctrine, that he is gone to teach the Indians, with whom he u&s;ed to trade.</P>
<P>April 18. This day was publi&s;hed our brother Whitefield's Letter to the Inhabitants of Maryland, Virginia, North and South Carolina, about their abu&s;e of the poor negroes <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See his works, vol. IV.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Heard of a drinking club that had a negroe boy attending them, who u&s;ed to mimic people for their diver&s;ion. The Gentlemen bid him mimic our brother Whitefield, which he was very unwilling to do; but they in&s;i&s;ting upon it, he &s;tood up and &s;aid, 'I &s;peak the truth in Chri&s;t, I lie not, un|le&s;s

<P>&mdash;Notice was given of a new lecture at Ger|man-Town every Thur&s;day, by four Mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>April 22. Agreed with Mr. Allen for five thou|&s;and acres of land on the forks of Delaware, at 2200 l. &s;terling, the conveyance to be made to Mr. Whitefield, and after that a&s;&s;igned to me, as &s;ecu|rity for my advancing the money. Mr. White|field propo&s;es to give orders for building the ne|groe &s;chool on the purcha&s;ed land, before he leaves the province.</P>
<P>April 24. Came to Chri&s;topher Wigner's plan|tation in Skippack, where many Dutch people are &s;ettled, and where the famous Mr. Spalemburg re|&s;ided lately. It was &s;urprizing to &s;ee &s;uch a mul|titude of people gathered together in &s;uch a wil|derne&s;s country, thirty miles di&s;tant from Philadel|phia. &mdash;Our brother was exceedingly carried out in his &s;ermon, to pre&s;s poor &s;inners to come to Chri&s;t by faith, and claim all their privileges, <HI>viz.</HI> Not only righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace, but joy in the Holy Gho&s;t: and after he had done, our dear friend Pe|ter Boehler preached in Dutch, to tho&s;e who could not under&s;tand our brother in Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>Before our brother left Philadelphia, he was de|&s;ired to vi&s;it one who was under a deep &s;en&s;e of &s;in from hearing him preach. And in praying with this per&s;on, he was &s;o carried beyond him&s;elf, that the whole company (which were about twenty) &s;eemed to be filled with the Holy Gho&s;t, and mag|nified the God of heaven.</P>
<P>April 25. Ro&s;e at three o'clock; and though our brother Whitefield was very weak in body, yet the Lord enabled him to ride near fifty miles, and to preach to about five thou&s;and people at Amwell, with the &s;ame power as u&s;ual.&mdash;Mr. Gilbert Ten|nent,

Several from Beauford in South-Carolina, then received their fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions. All the&s;e things gave him great encouragement. And though his fa|mily was now great, (near a hundred and fifty, in|cluding workmen) and the plan laid down would have required &s;ome thou&s;ands to &s;upport it; and although very often he had not twenty pounds in ca&s;h, he was &s;till kept from being di&s;heartened; and his friends, believing the work to be of God, continued cheerfully to a&s;&s;i&s;t him.</P>
<P>Though he was very weak in body, yet the cry from various quarters for more preaching, and the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of &s;upplying &s;o large a family, made him go again to Charle&s;town, where, as well as at Dorche&s;ter, A&s;hley-Ferry, Ponpon, and John's-I&s;land, he preach|ed to very attentive and affected auditories. Char|le&s;town was the place of the greate&s;t &s;ucce&s;s, and of the greate&s;t oppo&s;ition. The Commi&s;&s;ary poured out his anathemas, refu&s;ed to give him the &s;acrament, and publi&s;hed &s;ome letters again&s;t him. But all in vain. He preached twice almo&s;t every day, to great crowds, in the independent and Bapti&s;t meeting-hou&s;es; be&s;ides ex|pounding in the evening in merchants hou&s;es. Thus he went on &s;ucce&s;sfully (though often ready to die with the exce&s;&s;ive heat) till the end of Augu&s;t: when having received mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing invitations from the Rev. Dr. Colman, and Mr. Cooper, mini&s;ters in Bo&s;ton; and being de&s;irous of &s;eeing the de&s;cendants of the good old Puritans, and their &s;eats of learn|ing; and having encouragement that &s;omething might be done for the Orphan-hou&s;e, he embark|ed in the Orphan-hou&s;e &s;loop for New-England, in company with &s;everal Charle&s;town friends; and ar|rived at Rhode-&s;land, September 14.</P>
<P>Here &s;everal Gentlemen &s;oon came to vi&s;it him, among whom was the Rev. Mr. Clap, an aged di&s;|&s;enting mini&s;ter, in whom he thought he &s;aw what manner of men the old Puritans were who fir&s;t &s;et|tled

New-England, and was much delighted with his conver&s;ation. They went together to the incum|bent's hou&s;e, to a&s;k the u&s;e of the church, which was granted; and in it he preached three days, twice a day, to deeply affected auditories.</P>
<P>This he thought was a happy entrance into New-England. But he was &s;till more agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed, when, before he got to Bo&s;ton, he was met &s;everal miles from the city, by the governor's &s;on, and &s;ome of the mini&s;ters, and principal inhabitants, who con|ducted him to Mr. St&mdash;nf&mdash;rd's (brother-in-law to Dr. Colman) who, with his colleague Mr. Cooper, and many others, came and joined in prayer.</P>
<P>Jonathan Belcher, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> was then Governor of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's colony, and Jo&s;iah Willard, Secretary. Both the&s;e Gentlemen were his &s;incere friends, &s;o were the Mini&s;ters, Me&s;&s;rs. Web, Foxcraft, Prince, Dr. Sewald, Gee, &amp;c. To avoid, however, giving any ju&s;t offence, he went to the Engli&s;h church to morning prayers; but finding, by conver&s;ation with the Commi&s;&s;ary, and &s;ome other clergy, that there was no acce&s;s there, he began preaching in the after|noon, at Dr. Colman's meeting-hou&s;e, and &s;o went round (except when he preached on the common) to the other meeting-hou&s;es, e&s;pecially the large&s;t of them, for &s;ome time together.</P>
<P>Governor Belcher, generally attended; Secretary Willard, and &s;everal of the Council, &s;et the &s;ame example; and all &s;eemed to vie who &s;hould &s;how the greate&s;t re&s;pect.

<P>He &s;et out next for Northampton: having read in England, an account of a remarkable work of con|ver&s;ion there, publi&s;hed by their Pa&s;tor the Rev. Mr. Jonathan Edwards; and having a great de&s;ire to &s;ee him, and to hear the account from his own mouth.</P>
<P>At Concord, Sudbury, Marlborough, Worche&s;ter, Leice&s;ter, Hadley, places all lying in the way, pul|pits and hou&s;es were every where opened, and a con|tinued influence attended his preaching. At Nor|thampton, when he came to remind them of what God had formerly done for them, it was like putting fire to tinder. Both Mini&s;ter and people were much moved; as were the children of the family, at an ex|hortation which their father de&s;ired Mr. Whitefield to give them.</P>
<P>After leaving Northampton, he preached in We&s;t|field, Springfield, Suffield Wind&s;or, Hertford, Wea|thersfield, Middleton, and Wallingford, to large and affected congregations. And October 23, reached Newhaven, where he was affectionately received by
<PB N="74" REF="013298_0074_0F904F7EA5F8CF58">
Mr. Pierpont, brother-in-law to Mr. Edwards, and had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing his friend Mr. Noble of New-York, who brought him letters from Georgia. Here al&s;o he was much refre&s;hed with the conver|&s;ation of &s;everal Go&s;pel Mini&s;ters. It being a&s;&s;embly time, and the Governor and Burge&s;&s;es then &s;itting he &s;tayed till Lord's-day, and had the plea&s;ure to &s;ee numbers daily impre&s;&s;ed, The good old Governor was particularly much affected; and at a private vi&s;it which Mr. Whitefield paid him, &s;aid,
<Q>Thanks be to God, for &s;uch refre&s;hings in our way to hea|ven.</Q></P>
<P>On Monday morning he &s;et forward, and preach|ed with u&s;ual &s;ucce&s;s at Milford, Stratford, Fairfield, Newark, and Stanford, where he was vi&s;ited by &s;ome Mini&s;ters under deep concern.</P>
<P>This was on the borders of New-York province, into which he now again entered, and preached at Rye and King&s;bridge, on his way to the city of New-York, where he arrived October 30. Here for three days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, and afterwards at Statten-I&s;land, Newark, Ba&s;kenridge, his preaching appear|ed to be attended, with more &s;ucce&s;s than ever. At Trenton he had a long conference with &s;ome Mi|ni&s;ters about Mr. Gilbert Tenent's complying with an invitation to go and preach in New-England. After prayer, and con&s;idering the arguments both for and again&s;t this propo&s;al, they thought it be&s;t he &s;hould go; which, however diffident of him&s;elf, he was per&s;uaded to do. And his mini&s;trations were at|tended with an extraordinary ble&s;&s;ing to multitudes, as is particularly narrated el&s;ewhere <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Prince's Chri&s;tian Hi&s;tory, or, hi&s;torical collections of the &s;ucce&s;s of the Go&s;pel, vol. II. where the facts are &s;et down in the order of time.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>About this time Mr. Whitefield wrote his Letter to &s;ome church-members of the Pre&s;byterian per&s;ua|&s;ion,

<P>What &s;ort of reception he had in New-England, will farther appear from the following letters of &s;ome eminent Mini&s;ters of Bo&s;ton, and adjacent towns, publi&s;hed by the Rev. Mr. Jo&s;iah Smith, of Charle&s;|town, in the South-Carolina Gazette.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>October</HI> 1, 1740.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Rev. and dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Your kind letter by Mr. Whitefield, and your other, are both now before me. You rai&s;ed our expectations of him very much, as did his Journals more, and Mr. P. of New-York, concurred with them; but we own now, that we have &s;een and heard him, that our expectations are all an&s;wered and exceeded, not only in his zealous, and fervent, abounding labours, but in the command of the hearts, and affections of his hearers.&mdash;He has been received here as an angel of God, and fervant of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.&mdash;I hope this vi&s;it to us, will be of very great u&s;e and benefit to Mini&s;ters and peo|ple. He has found his heart and mouth much opened to &s;peak freely and boldly to us, and he finds it received with joy.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>The &s;ame Gentleman, November 29, 1740, writes thus:&mdash;
<Q>Mr. White|field left us &s;even weeks ago; the la&s;t week we heard of him at Philadelphia. I heard that much of the pre&s;ence of God is with him. He has left a ble&s;&s;ing behind him, we hope with us. Our people, high and low, old and young, are very &s;wift to hear. The excellent meekne&s;s of Mr. Whitefield's an&s;wer to the queri&s;ts, will honour him to you.</Q></P>
<P>Another, in a Letter, October 22, 1740. expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf thus: <Q>Though it is always a &s;ingular
<PB N="76" REF="013298_0076_0F904F80317B9A40">
plea&s;ure to me to hear from you, yet your two let|ters by Mr. Whitefield, had a new circum&s;tance of plea&s;ure from the dear hand that pre&s;ented them. I perceive you was impatient to know what &s;ort of entering in he had among us. We (Mini&s;ters, rulers, and people) generally received him as an angel of God. When he preached his farewell &s;ermon in our common, there were twen|ty-three thou&s;and, at a moderate computation. We are abundantly convinced, that you &s;poke the words of truth and &s;oberne&s;s in your &s;ermon relat|ing to him, &s;uch a power and pre&s;ence of God with a preacher, and in religious a&s;&s;emblies, I never &s;aw before; but I would not limit the Holy One of I&s;rael. The prejudices of many are quite con|quered, and expectations of others va&s;tly outdone, as they freely own. A con&s;iderable number are awakened, and many chri&s;tians &s;eem to be greatly quickened. He has preached twice at Cambridge; he has one warm friend there, Mr. &mdash;, the tutor, who has followed him to Northampton, and will, for what I know, to Georgia. But Mr. White|field has not a warmer friend any where, than the fir&s;t man among us. Our Governor has &s;hewn him the highe&s;t re&s;pect, carried him in his coach from place to place, and could not help following him fifty miles out of town. I hope the religion of the country will fare the better for the impre&s;&s;ions left on him.</Q>
&mdash;The &s;ame Gentleman writes, Decem|ber 2, 1740,
<Q>The man greatly beloved, I &s;uppo&s;e, may be with you before now. That his vi&s;it here will be e&s;teemed a di&s;tingui&s;hing mercy of hea|ven by many, I am well &s;atisfied. Every day gives me fre&s;h proofs of Chri&s;t's &s;peaking in him. A &s;mall &s;et of Gentlemen among&s;t us, when they &s;aw the affections of the people &s;o moved under his preaching, would attribute it only to the force of &s;ound and ge&s;tures. But the impre&s;&s;ions on
<PB N="77" REF="013298_0077_0F904F80E78566B0">
many are &s;o la&s;ting, and have been &s;o transforming as to carry plain &s;ignatures of a divine hand going along with him.&mdash;Another Gentleman writes, Oc|tober 21, 1740, and thanks me for recommending to him, &s;o worthy a per&s;on as the Rev. Mr. White|field, who has preached Chri&s;t, and the great truths of the Go&s;pel among them, with remarkable fer|vour of &s;pirit, and to a general acceptance, and hopes that there are many awakened by his mi|ni&s;try. &mdash;Another of the &s;ame date writes, That he had conceived very highly of him by &s;ome clau&s;es in my private letters, and the &s;ermon I preached by way of apology, &amp;c. but confe&s;&s;es he had not gone high enough in his opinion of him, and that his expectations are more than an|&s;wered in him.&mdash;Another, November 21, 1740, ble&s;&s;es God that he was &s;ent thither; that he had &s;o many opportunities of &s;eeing him, and &s;itting under his mini&s;try. That he appeared to him a wonderful man indeed; that his preaching was ac|companied with a divine power, and energy, be|yond any man's he had ever heard before: and the effects of his mini&s;try were very marvellous among them.&mdash;I &s;hall conclude with the following pa&s;&s;age of another Gentleman, in a letter of No|vember 1, 1740. I received yours by the Rev. Mr. Whitefield, with whom I coveted a great deal more private conver&s;ation than I had opportunity for, by rea&s;on of the throngs of people almo&s;t perpe|tually with him. But he appears to be full of the love of God, and fired with an extraordinary zeal for the cau&s;e of Chri&s;t, and applies him&s;elf with the mo&s;t indefatigable diligence, that ever was &s;een among us, for the promoting the good of &s;ouls. His head, his heart, his hands &s;eem to be full of his Ma&s;ter's bu&s;ine&s;s. His di&s;cour&s;es, e&s;pe|cially when he goes into the expo&s;itory way, are very entertaining. Every eye is fixed upon him,
<PB N="78" REF="013298_0078_0F904F822E7FBF60">
and every ear chained to his lips. Mo&s;t are very much affected; many are awakened and con|vinced; and a general &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s excited. His addre&s;s more e&s;pecially to the pa&s;&s;ions, is wonder|ful, and beyond what I have ever &s;een. I think I can truly &s;ay, that his preaching has quickened me, and I believe it has many others be&s;ides, as well as the people. Several of my flock, e&s;pecial|ly the younger &s;ort, have been brought under con|victions by his preaching; and there is this re|markable among&s;t them of the good effect of his preaching, that the word now preached by us, &s;eems more precious to them, and comes with more power upon them. My prayer for him is, that his precious life may be lengthened out, and that he may be an in&s;trument of reviving dying religion in all places whither&s;oever he comes, who &s;eems to be wonderfully fitted for, as well as &s;pirit|ed to it.</Q></P>
<P>Saturday November 8, Mr. Whitefield came back to Philadelphia, and next day preached to &s;everal thou&s;ands in a hou&s;e built for that purpo&s;e, &s;ince his la&s;t departure. Here he both heard of, and &s;aw many, who were the fruits of former mini&s;trations; and continued among them till November 17, preach|ing twice a day. Afterwards he preached in Glou|ce&s;ter, Greenwich, Piles-Grove, Cohen&s;ie, Salem, Newca&s;tle, Whitely-Creek, Fog's Manor, Notting|ham; in many or mo&s;t of which places, the con|gregations were numerous and deeply affected.</P>
<P>November 22, he got to Bohemia in Maryland, and from thence he went to Reedy-I&s;land. At both places his preaching was attended with great influence. And at la&s;t (their &s;loop being detained by contrary winds near a week) he preached frequent|ly. All the Captains and crews of the &s;hips that were wind-bound con&s;tantly attended, and great numbers crowded out of the country, &s;ome as far as from Phi|ladelphia:
<PB N="79" REF="013298_0079_0F904F8269739E38">
and as great concern as ever came upon their minds.</P>
<P>December 1, he &s;et &s;ail from Reedy-I&s;land for Charle&s;town in South-Carolina, and here he makes the following remark:
<Q>It is now the &s;eventy-fifth day, &s;ince I arrived at Rhode-I&s;land. My body was then weak, but the Lord has much renewed its &s;trength. I have been enabled to preach, I think an hundred and &s;eventy-five times in public, be|&s;ides exhorting frequently in private. I have travelled upwards of eight hundred miles, and got|ten upwards of &s;even hundred pounds &s;terling in goods, provi&s;ions and money, for the Georgia orphans. Never did I perform my journeys with &s;o little fatigue, or &s;ee &s;uch continuance of the di|vine pre&s;ence in the congregations to whom I have preached. Prai&s;e the Lord, O my &s;oul<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Journals, December 1, 1740.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>After a plea&s;ant pa&s;&s;age of eight or nine days, and preaching again at Charle&s;town and Savannah, he ar|rived on the 14th of December at the Orphan-hou&s;e, where he found his family comfortably &s;ettled. At Rhode-I&s;land he had providentially met with one Mr. Jonathan Barber, who&s;e heart was very much knit to him, and who was willing to help him at the Orphan-hou&s;e. Him, therefore, he left &s;uperin|tendent for the &s;piritual, and Mr. Haber&s;ham for the temporal affairs; and having &s;pent a very comfortable Chri&s;tmas with his orphan family, he &s;et off again for <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">At Charle&s;town, the Commi&s;&s;ary was going to proceed again&s;t him for correcting and preparing for the pre&s;s, a letter written by Mr. Hugh B&mdash;n, in which it was hinted, that the clergy break their canons. He al&s;o laid him under &s;u&s;pen&s;ion for omit|ting to u&s;e the form of prayer, pre&s;cribed in the communion book, when officiating in a di&s;&s;enting con|gregation.&mdash;But Mr. Whitefield gave &s;ecurity for his appearance, and appealed home.</NOTE> Charle&s;town, where he arrived January 3, 1741,

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VII.</HI> From his Arrival in <HI>ENGLAND,</HI> in the Year 1741, to his leaving <HI>SCOTLAND,</HI> the &s;ame Year.</HEAD>
<P>THE new and unexpected &s;ituation in which he now found him&s;elf, will be be&s;t de&s;cribed in his own words:
<Q>But what a trying &s;cene appear|ed here! In my zeal, during my journey through America, I had written two well-meant, though injudicious letters, again&s;t England's two great fa|vourites, <HI>The Whole Duty of Man,</HI> and Archbi&s;hop Tillot&s;on, who, I &s;aid, knew no more of religion than Mahomet. The Moravians had made in|roads upon the &s;ocieties. Mr. John We&s;ley, &s;ome way or other, had been prevailed on to preach and print in favour of perfection, and univer&s;al redemption; and very &s;trongly again&s;t election, a doctrine, which I thought, and do now believe was taught me of God, therefore could not po&s;&s;ible recede from. Thinking it my duty &s;o to do, I had written an an&s;wer at the Orphan-hou&s;e, which though revi&s;ed, and much approved of by &s;ome good and judicious divines, I think had &s;ome too &s;trong expre&s;&s;ions about ab&s;olute reprobation, which the Apo&s;tle leaves rather to be inferred, than expre&s;t. The world was angry at me for the former, and numbers of my own &s;piritual children for the latter. One that got &s;ome hundreds of pounds by my &s;ermons, being led away by the Moravians, refu&s;ed to print for me any more. And others wrote to me, that God would de&s;troy me in a fortnight; and that my fall was as great as
<PB N="82" REF="013298_0082_0F904F85433F6008">
Peter's. In&s;tead of having thou&s;ands to attend me, &s;carce one of my &s;piritual children came to &s;ee me from morning to night. Once at Ken|nington-Common, I had not above a hundred to hear me. At the &s;ame time, I was much embar|ra&s;&s;ed in my outward circum&s;tances. A thou&s;and pounds I owed for the Orphan-hou&s;e. Two hun|dred and fifty pounds bills, drawn upon Mr. Seward, now dead, were returned upon me. I was al&s;o threatened to be arre&s;ted for two hun|dred pounds more. My travelling expences al&s;o to be defrayed. A family of a hundred to be daily maintained, four thou&s;and miles off, in the deare&s;t place of the King's dominions. Ten thou|&s;and times would I rather have died, than part with my old friends. It would have melted any heart to have heard Mr. Charles We&s;ley and me weeping, after prayer, that, if po&s;&s;ible, the breach might be prevented. Once I preached in the Foundery, (a place which Mr. John We&s;ley had procured in my ab&s;ence) on Gal. iii. but no more. All my work was to begin again. One day, I was exceedingly refre&s;hed in reading Beza's life of Calvin, wherein were the&s;e words, 'Calvin is turned out of Geneva, but behold a new church ari&s;es.' A Gentlewoman lent me three hundred pounds to pay the pre&s;ent Orphan-hou&s;e demand: and a &s;erious per&s;on (whom I never &s;aw or heard of) giving me one guinea; I had &s;uch confidence, that I ran down with it to a friend, and expre&s;&s;ed my hope, that God who &s;ent this per&s;on with the guinea, would make it up fifteen hundred: which was the &s;um I thought would be wanted.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Never had I preached in Moorfields on a week day. But in the &s;trength of God, I began on Good-Friday, and continued twice a day, walking back|ward and forward from Leadenhall, for &s;ome time preaching under one of the trees, and had the
<PB N="83" REF="013298_0083_0F904F857B31B790">
mortification of &s;eeing numbers of my &s;piritual children, who but a twelvemonth ago could have plucked out their eyes for me, running by me whil&s;t preaching, di&s;daining &s;o much as to look at me, and &s;ome of them putting their fingers in their ears, that they might not hear one word I &s;aid.</Q></P>
<P><Q>A like &s;cene opened at Bri&s;tol, where I was de|nied preaching in the hou&s;e I had founded: Bu&s;y bodies, on both &s;ides, blew up the coals. A breach en&s;ued. But as both &s;ides differed in judg|ment, and not in affection, and aimed at the glory of our common Lord; though we hearkened too much to tale-bearers on both &s;ides, we were kept from anathematizing each other, and went on in our u&s;ual way; being agreed in one point, endea|vouring to convert &s;ouls to their ever ble&s;&s;ed Me|diator.</Q></P>
<P>About this time he was ordered to attend in the Parliament Hou&s;e, to give information concerning the &s;tate of the colony in Georgia.
<Q>April 10, 1741. I have been at the Parliament Hou&s;e. The Georgia affair was adjourned. It was &s;ome|what of a trial to be in the hou&s;e. I then re|membered what the Apo&s;tle &s;aid, 'We are be|come a &s;pectacle to men' My appeal will come to nothing, I believe. I have waited upon the Speaker. He received me kindly<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letter CCLXXIV.</NOTE>.</Q>
Again,
<Q>He treated me kindly, and a&s;&s;ured me, that there would be no per&s;ecution in this King's reign.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Letter CCLXXXVI.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this, one Mr. Cennick, a preacher, who could not fall in with Mr. We&s;ley's &s;entiments, and one or two more in like circum&s;tances, having joined Mr. Whitefield, they began a new hou&s;e in King&s;wood, and &s;oon e&s;tabli&s;hed a &s;chool among them, that favoured Calvini&s;tical principles. And here, and in &s;everal other places, they preached
<PB N="84" REF="013298_0084_0F904F86408A4E40">
to very large and &s;erious congregations, in the &s;ame manner as he had done in America.</P>
<P>Thither he intended to return as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. Mean time, it being inconvenient, on account of the weather, to preach morning and evening in Moor|fields; &s;ome free-grace Di&s;&s;enters, (who &s;tood by him clo&s;ely in that time of trial) got the loan of a piece of ground, and engaged with a carpenter to build a large temporary &s;hed, to &s;creen the auditory from cold and rain, which he called a Tabernacle, as it was only intended to be made u&s;e of for a few months, during his &s;tay in his native country. The place fixed upon, was very near the Foundery, which he di&s;liked, becau&s;e he thought it looked like erecting altar again&s;t altar; but upon this occa&s;ion he re|marks,
<Q>All was wonderfully over-ruled for good, and for the furtherance of the Go&s;pel. A fre&s;h awakening immediately began. Congregations grew exceeding large, and at the people's de&s;ire, I &s;ent (nece&s;&s;ity reconciling me more and more to lay-preaching) for Me&s;&s;ieurs Cennick, Harris, Seagrave, Humphries, &amp;c. to a&s;&s;i&s;t <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. S.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>Fre&s;h doors were now opened to him, and invita|tions &s;ent to him from many places, where he had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ver been. At a common, near Braintree in E&s;&s;ex, upwards of ten thou&s;and per&s;ons attended. At Hal|&s;tead, Dedham, Co&s;sle&s;hall, Whethersfield, Colce&s;|ter, Bury, Ip&s;wich, the congregations were very large and much affected.
<Q>Sweet was the conver|&s;ation I had with &s;everal Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t. But our own clergy grew more and more &s;hy, now they knew I was a Calvini&s;t; though no doubt (as Mr. Bedford told me when going to the Bi&s;hop of London) our Articles are Calvini&s;tical <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">M.

<P>At this time al&s;o, he was &s;trongly &s;olicited by reli|gious per&s;ons of different per&s;ua&s;ions, to vi&s;it Scotland. Several letters had pa&s;t between him and the Me&s;|&s;ieurs
<PB N="85" REF="013298_0085_0F8FFAD849F84EA0">
Er&s;kines, &s;ome time before <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>See his Journals, and his Letters to the Rev. Mr. R. E. and the Rev. Mr. E. E.</P>
<P>In his la&s;t to Mr. E. E. before coming to Scot|land (Letter CCLXXX) he writes,
<Q>May 16, 1741. This morning, I received a kind letter from your brother Ralph, who thinks it be&s;t for me wholly to join the A&s;&s;ociate Pre&s;bytery, if it &s;hould plea&s;e God to &s;end me into Scotland. This I cannot altogether come into. I come only as an occa&s;ion|al preacher, to preach the &s;imple Go&s;pel to all that are willing to hear me, of whatever denomi|nation. I write this, that there may not be the lea&s;t mi&s;under&s;tanding between us. I love and honour the A&s;&s;ociate Pre&s;bytery in the bowels of Je&s;us Chri&s;t: but, let them not be offended, if in all things, I cannot immediately fall in with them.</Q></P>
<P>To the &s;ame purpo&s;e he writes to Mr. R. E. May 23, 1741. Letter CCLXXXVIII.</P></NOTE>, and he had a great de&s;ire to &s;ee them. He therefore took his pa&s;|&s;age from London to Leith, where (after five days which he employed in writing many execellent letters to his Orphans, &amp;c. See Letters CCCXI. to CCCXXXVII.) he arrived July 30, 1741. Several per&s;ons of di&s;tinction mo&s;t gladly received him, and would have had him preach at Edinburgh directly; but he was determined that the Rev. Me&s;&s;ieurs Er|&s;kines &s;hould have the fir&s;t offer; and therefore went immediately to Dumfermlin, and preached in Mr. Er|&s;kine's Meeting-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Great per&s;ua&s;ions were u&s;ed to detain him at Dumfermlin, and as great to keep him from preach|ing for and vi&s;iting the Rev. Mr. Wardlaw, who had been colleague to Mr. Ralph Er&s;kine above twen|ty years, and who, as well as the Rev. Mr. David|&s;on, a di&s;&s;enting Mini&s;ter in England, that went along
<PB N="86" REF="013298_0086_0F904F86F9B10330">
with Mr. Whitefield, were looked upon as perjured, for not adhering to the Solemn League and Covenant. This was new language to him, and therefore unin|telligible. But that he might be better informed, it was propo&s;ed that the Rev. Mr. Moncrief, Mr. Ebe|nezer Er&s;kine, and others, members of the A&s;&s;ociate Pre&s;bytery, &s;hould convene in a few days, in order to give him farther light.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Mr. Ralph Er&s;kine accompa|nied him to Edinburgh, where he preached in the Orphan-hou&s;e Park, (field-preaching being no novel|ty in Scotland) to a very large and affected auditory, upon the&s;e words,

The next day he preach|ed in the We&s;t Kirk, and expre&s;&s;ed great plea&s;ure in hearing two Go&s;pel &s;ermons from the Rev. Mr. Gu&s;t|hart, and the Rev. Mr. MacVicar. And the following day, he preached in the Cannongate church, where Mr. Ralph Er&s;kine went up with him into the pul|pit.</P>
<P>According to promi&s;e, he returned with him to Dumfermlin, where Mr. Ebenezer Er&s;kine, and &s;e|veral of the A&s;&s;ociate Pre&s;bytery were met together. When Mr. Whitefield came, they &s;oon propo&s;ed to proceed to bu&s;ine&s;s. He a&s;ked them for what pur|po&s;e? They an&s;wered, to di&s;cour&s;e, and &s;et him right about Church Government, and the Solemn League and Covenant. He replied, they might &s;ave them&s;elves that trouble, for he had no &s;cruple about it, and that &s;ettling Church Government, and preaching about the Solemn League and Cove|nant, was not his plan. He then told them &s;ome|thing of his experience, and how he was let into his pre&s;ent way of acting. One of them, in particu|lar, &s;aid he was deeply affected. And Mr. Ebene|zer Er&s;kine de&s;ired they would have patience with him, for that having been born and bred in England,
<PB N="87" REF="013298_0087_0F904F87D45ADC78">
and never &s;tudied the point, he could not be &s;up|po&s;ed to be perfectly acquainted with it. But Mr. M. in&s;i&s;ted, that he was therefore more inexcu&s;eable, for England had revolted mo&s;t with re&s;pect to Church Government; and that he being born and educated there, could not but be acquainted with the matter in debate. Mr. Whitefield told him, he had never yet made the Solemn League and Covenant the &s;ub|ject of his &s;tudy, being too bu&s;y about matters which he judged of greater importance. Several replied, that every pin of the Tabernacle was precious. He an&s;wered, that in every building, there were out&s;ide and in&s;ide workmen; that the latter, at pre&s;ent, was his province; that if they thought them&s;elves called to the former, they might proceed in their own way, and he would proceed in his. He then a&s;ked them &s;eriou&s;ly, what they would have him to do? The an&s;wer was, that he was not de&s;ired to &s;ub&s;cribe immediately to the Solemn League and Covenant, but to preach only for them, till he had further light. He a&s;ked, Why only for them? Mr. Ralph Er&s;kine &s;aid, "They were the Lord's people." He then a&s;ked, Were no other the Lord's people but them&s;elves? If not, and if others were the devil's people, they had more need to be preached to; that for his part, all places were alike to him; and that if the Pope him&s;elf would lend his pulpit, he would gladly proclaim in it the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Something pa&s;&s;ed about taking two of their brethren with him to England, to &s;ettle Pre&s;|bytery there; and then with two more, to go and &s;ettle Pre&s;bytery in America. But he a&s;ked, &s;uppo&s;e a number of Independents &s;hould come, and declare, that after the greate&s;t &s;earch, they were convinced that Independency was the right Church Govern|ment, and would di&s;turb no body, if tolerated; &s;hould they be tolerated? They an&s;wered, No.&mdash;Soon af|ter this the company broke up. And Mr. M. preached

<Q>I attended; but the good man &s;o &s;pent him&s;elf in the former part of his &s;ermon, in talking again&s;t prelacy, the Common Prayer-book, the &s;urplice, the ro&s;e in the hat, and &s;uch like externals; that when he came to the latter part of his text, to invite poor &s;inners to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, his breath was &s;o gone, that he could &s;carce be heard.

The con&s;equence of all this, was, an open breach. Mr. Whitefield retired thoughtful and unea&s;y to his clo&s;et, and after preach|ing in the fields, &s;at down and dined with them, and then took a final leave.

<Q>April 20, 1742 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gla&s;gow Weekly Hi&s;tory, No. XXVII.</NOTE>. Rev. and dear Sir, Knowing that many are careful to inform you, from time to time, what pa&s;&s;es here, I have hitherto delayed an&s;wering your mo&s;t ac|ceptable Letter, until I &s;hould tell you with the greate&s;t certainty, what were the ble&s;&s;ed effects of your mini&s;trations among&s;t us; and can now a&s;|&s;ure you, that they were not more &s;urpri&s;ing than la&s;ting. I don't know, or hear of any wrought upon by your mini&s;try, but are holding on in the paths of truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s. They &s;eem po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of a truly chri&s;tian &s;pirit. Je&s;us is precious to their &s;ouls; and like the morning light, they are advancing with increa&s;ing brightne&s;s to the perfect day. Since you left Scotland, numbers in different corners have been awakened. Many in a hopeful way. Religion in this &s;inful city revives and flouri&s;hes. Ordinances are more punc|tually attended on. People hear the word with gladne&s;s, and receive it in faith and love. New meetings for prayer and &s;piritual conference are erecting every where. Religious conver&s;ation has bani&s;hed &s;lander and callumny from &s;everal

<P><Q>I cannot ea&s;ily expre&s;s, with what plea&s;ure I write the&s;e things; and doubtle&s;s, they will give you no le&s;s joy in reading them. Should not the&s;e droppings of the dew of heaven encourage our faith and hope of a plentiful effu&s;ion of the Spirit, which will at once change our barren wilderne&s;s into a fruitful field? Should not this ha&s;ten your re|turn, that we may take &s;weet coun&s;el together, and enter into the hou&s;e of God in company? You are often on our hearts. We long to &s;ee you face to face. May much of your great Ma&s;|ter's pre&s;ence ever attend, and come along with you.</Q></P>

<Q>Edinburgh, Augu&s;t 8, 1743. As you de&s;ired, I have with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Mr. Archibald Bowie, Mr. Dun, and the <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Letter CCCCXXII.</NOTE> &s;erjeant, informed my&s;elf a little, with re|&s;pect to the number and &s;ituations of the praying &s;ocieties in this place, which you will take as fol|lows: They are, as near as we can gue&s;s, between twenty-four and thirty in number, &s;ome of which will nece&s;&s;arily be obliged to divide, by rea&s;on of too many meeting together; and that will increa&s;e the number. Among&s;t them are &s;everal meetings of boys and girls, who, in general, &s;eem not only to be growing in grace, but really increa&s;ing in knowledge.

Chri&s;t; as a young Gentleman of my acquaint|ance told me, when under a temptation to think, that he was &s;urely &s;eeking &s;ome imaginary re|fuge, in&s;tead of the Saviour, he was made to cry out in prayer, 'Lord, I want nothing el&s;e, and will have nothing &s;hort of the very Chri&s;t of God.' There are &s;everal meetings of young women, who (although I never, as yet, vi&s;ited any of them) I am informed, hold on very well. The &s;erjeant tells me, that at one of the&s;e meetings, on the morning of the Lord's-day, he has known them all wet with floods of tears, melted down with love to Chri&s;t, and affection to one another for Chri&s;t's &s;ake. I have my&s;elf been much ra|vi&s;hed (when in a meeting in the room below, where &s;ome of the&s;e re&s;ort) to hear them &s;ing the Lord's prai&s;es with &s;uch melodious voices. There are numbers of young men who meet for the ex|cellent purpo&s;e of glorifying God, and promoting chri&s;tian knowledge; among&s;t &s;ome of whom I have the honour to be a member; many of them are Divines, who are u&s;eful in in&s;tructing the weaker &s;ort of us; and that they endeavour to do with the greate&s;t anxiety and de&s;ire. A good number of old men, &s;ub&s;tantial, &s;tanding chri&s;tians, meet for their edification and in&s;truction (the glo|ry of their God being always their chief end) and are thereby often revived, and very much refre&s;h|ed. The generality of the&s;e &s;orts, above-mention|ed, do walk very circum&s;pectly, and really make it appear to the world, that they have been with Je&s;us: which is very much evidenced in their chearfully bearing reproaches for Chri&s;t's &s;ake. And upon the whole, we hope there is &s;uch a flame kindled, as &s;hall never be extingui&s;hed. And with re&s;pect to two particular &s;ocieties, whereof Mr. Bowie is a member, he gave me

<Q>Edinburgh, Augu&s;t 6, 1743. As you de&s;ire a &s;hort account of the two &s;ocieties I am concerned in, I &s;hall give it in a very few words. They con&s;i&s;t of twenty-five or twenty-&s;ix members each; and, except a very few, are all per&s;ons who&s;e concern about religion, be|gan in the late awakening. I never &s;aw the ends of &s;uch &s;ocieties an&s;wered near &s;o well, as among the&s;e. I think, I may &s;afely declare, that I was never witne&s;s to &s;o much of real chri&s;tian exerci&s;e among any per&s;ons I have known, as I have ob|&s;erved, to my great &s;atisfaction, among mo&s;t of them. It is mo&s;t amazing to ob&s;erve, how much &s;ome of them, who at their fir&s;t concern, were bruti&s;hly ignorant of every thing good, have now made &s;uch advances in knowledge, that they ex|cel tho&s;e who were formerly far before them. The concern about their own &s;alvation is not on|ly remarkable, but the abiding earne&s;tne&s;s they &s;how in their prayers, for the increa&s;e of the Re|deemer's kingdom, is mo&s;t de&s;irable; and the care they &s;how in watching over one another, is one con|vincing evidence of their brotherly love, and true chri&s;tian tenderne&s;s. I might &s;ay a great deal more, but mu&s;t conclude. I am, &amp;c. A. Bowie.</Q></P>

This is not all; for &s;everal country people are beginning to a&s;&s;emble together in little meetings, to wor&s;hip their God: parti|cularly, the &s;erjeant informs me of one, about two miles from this place, where &s;everal plow|men, and other illiterate per&s;ons, meet for the&s;e mo&s;t noble ends and purpo&s;es; and are going mo&s;t &s;weetly on, much increa&s;ed in grace and know|ledge,
<PB N="94" REF="013298_0094_0F904F8DB52BA9F0">
and &s;ome are daily added to their number. I am informed from the ea&s;t country, (where there have been no &s;ocieties &s;ince the &s;ece&s;&s;ion) that about Old Cambus, &s;ix miles from Dunbar, many are now meeting together for &s;ocial prayer, and mutual conver&s;ation about matters of religion, wherein the Lord is with them of a truth. And in that place, there is more eager thir&s;ting for the word, than u&s;ual, and the Mini&s;ters are learning to &s;peak with new tongues. And one of my ac|quaintance, who was in this place la&s;t winter, has happily been the Lord's in&s;trument in begin|ning the&s;e &s;ocieties. How beautiful and refre&s;h|ing is it, my dear friend, to hear of &s;o many fol|lowing after the de&s;pi&s;ed Je&s;us? Should we not take it as a token for good, that young ones, in|&s;tead of &s;pending their &s;pare hours in idle, vain, and unprofitable play, do now a&s;&s;emble, and join in calling upon the Lord. Is it not a good &s;ign to hear many poor fooli&s;h virgins, (in&s;tead of be|ing employed in the vanities of the generality of their &s;ex) meeting together for prayer; and many prodigal youths, in&s;tead of revelling, and drunkenne&s;s, chambering, and wontonne&s;s, now breathing after the knowledge of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and him crucified? O that the Lord would more and more exert his almighty power among&s;t us. There are &s;everal other &s;ocieties for prayer, near about this city, pro&s;pering very well.</Q></P>

<P><Q>I am well informed by &s;ome Mini&s;ters, and other judicious and experienced chri&s;tians, that there are to the number of fifty per&s;ons already got notice of, in and about Gla&s;gow, that by all that can be judged by per&s;ons of the be&s;t di&s;cerning in &s;piritual things, are &s;avingly converted, by the ble&s;&s;ing and power of God, accompanying your ten &s;ermons in that place; be&s;ides &s;everal others under convictions, not reckoned in this number, who&s;e &s;tate remains, as yet, a little doubtful.

His being by education and profe&s;&s;ion of a different way, from what, I cannot but think, is mo&s;t ju&s;tly profe&s;&s;ed among us, &s;eems to me, to add n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ht to his te&s;timony; as does al|&s;o hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> Lord by this is, as it were, attracting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and attention to one, who had he been formerly of us, would doubtle&s;s, like others, be de&s;pi&s;ed. And yet, I cannot but look upon it as a &s;ad in&s;tance of a departing God, that, in&s;tead of regard, he meets not only with contempt, but with oppo&s;ition al&s;o, from tho&s;e who ought to act a very different part. Did he preach another Je&s;us, or another doctrine, he ought ju&s;tly to be rejected: but this is not the ca&s;e. And yet this very thing is advanced as an ar|gument again&s;t him: It is &s;aid, he advances nothing new. And I allow it. This gives his friends joy. But the&s;e reverend Gentlemen &s;hould mind, that there are two things in Go&s;pel ordinances, purity and power. The fir&s;t in mercy, we &s;till have in &s;ome good mea&s;ure (though complaints of the want of this are very open) but the la&s;t, we &s;adly confe&s;s the want of, and this is what attends the Go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ed by him. And &s;ure, I am, that even the credible reports of it &s;hould much endear him to all, who wi&s;h well to the intere&s;t of our dear, though too unknown, and altogether lovely Lord Je&s;us.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="013298_0099_0F904F93170D2368"><Q>His calmne&s;s and &s;erenity under all he meets with, yea his joy in tribulation, is to me &s;o &s;ur|pri&s;ing, that I often think, the Lord &s;ent him to this place, in particular, to teach me how to preach, and e&s;pecially how to &s;uffer.</Q></P>
<P><Q>His attachment to no party, but to Chri&s;t, and true grace alone, has long appeared to me a pecu|liar excellency in him. Chri&s;tianity has been &s;o long broken into &s;o many different &s;ects and par|ties, that an hone&s;t pagan might ju&s;tly be at a lo&s;s, was he among us, where to find the religion of Je&s;us.</Q></P>
<P><Q>One now appears, who loudly calls us (and who&s;e voice the Lord &s;eems to back with power) to look into the original plan of that religion we profe&s;s: &s;ure nothing more ju&s;t, nothing more rea|&s;onable. He tells us, wherein the kingdom of God does con&s;i&s;t. And yet how &s;ad is it, he &s;hould be de&s;pi&s;ed. Who knows but this may be the Lord's la&s;t voice to us, before he takes his kingdom from us?</Q></P>
<P><Q>As to what you a&s;k of his reception in this city; I invited him, nay, urged him, to under|take this journey, in con&s;equence of a corre&s;pon|dence with him, for more than two or three years. I did it with the concurrence of a very few. His journey was delayed, till bad reports had imbitter|ed the minds of almo&s;t all again&s;t him: &s;o that when he came, I could &s;carce obtain liberty for him to preach even in the fields. All that I could do, was what I had re&s;olved long before; I gave him with great plea&s;ure, and full freedom, my pul|pit, which, for that day, was in the church which our Magi&s;trates and principal people of note fre|quent. And at once, the Lord, by his preaching, melted down the hearts of his enemies, (except &mdash; and&mdash;) &s;o that, contrary to our cu&s;tom, he was al|lowed the &s;ame place and pulpit in the evening of that
<PB N="100" REF="013298_0100_0F904E8133F36870">
day and the other church as often as he plea&s;|ed.</Q></P>
<P><Q>While he &s;tayed among us in this city, he an|&s;wered our expectations &s;o much, that he has &s;carce more friends any where of its bulk, than here, where, at fir&s;t, almo&s;t all were again&s;t him. And the word came al&s;o with &s;o much power, that I hope &s;everal of different denominations, will ble&s;s the Lord for evermore, that ever they heard him. And in his way from us, I &s;aw in part, and have heard more fully &s;ince, what &s;atisfies that this was of the Lord, and for the good of many.</Q>
<Q><HI>P. S.</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e you have heard, that our Magi|&s;trates waited on him while here, and made him free of this place; though that is a compliment, rarely allowed to &s;trangers, of late.</Q></P>

<Q>October 8, 1741<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gla&s;gow Weekly Hi&s;tory, No. XIII.</NOTE>. Honoured Sir, I am favoured with yours, wherein you de&s;ire my thoughts of Mr. White|field, and an account of his labours and &s;ucce&s;s with us. Although my &s;entiments may be little regarded by many, yet when you put me to it, I think I am bound to do ju&s;tice to the character of this &s;tranger, which I &s;ee few willing to do. I am not much &s;urprized, though the devil, and all he can influence, be up in arms again&s;t the youth, &s;eeing he makes &s;uch bold and vigorous attacks upon his kingdom and &s;trong holds. As you, Sir, do ob&s;erve it to be with you, &s;o it is with us. He is hated, and &s;poken again&s;t, by all the epi&s;co|pal party, and even the mo&s;t of our clergy do la|bour to dimini&s;h and expo&s;e him: this is not to be wondered at, &s;eeing his ince&s;&s;ant labours for Chri&s;t and &s;ouls, is &s;uch a &s;trong reproof to them; be|&s;ides, what he &s;ays publicly, again&s;t the &s;ending out of unconverted Mini&s;ters, and their preaching

an unknown Chri&s;t; this mu&s;t be galling to car|nal men. I look upon this youth, as rai&s;ed up of God, for &s;pecial &s;ervice, and &s;pirited for making new and &s;ingular attempts, for promoting true chri&s;tianity in the world, and for reviving it where it is decayed; and I &s;ee him wonderfully fitted and &s;trengthened, both in body and mind, for go|ing through his projects, amid&s;t the greate&s;t di&s;|couragements and difficulties. I &s;ee the man to be all of a piece; his life and conver&s;ation to be a tran&s;cript of his &s;ermons. It is truly a rare thing, to &s;ee &s;o much of God about any one man. To &s;ee one &s;o eminent for humility, in the mid&s;t of applau&s;e; for meekne&s;s and patience, under reproaches and injuries; for love to ene|mies; for de&s;ire to glorify Chri&s;t, and &s;ave &s;ouls; contentment in a mean lot, acquie&s;ing in the will of God in all ca&s;es, never fretting under any di&s;|pen&s;ation, but &s;till prai&s;ing and giving thanks for every thing. It is rare to &s;ee in a man, &s;uch a flaming fire for God and again&s;t &s;in, when in the pulpit; and yet mo&s;t ea&s;y and calm in conver&s;ing with men out of it; careful not to give offence to them, and yet never courting the favour of any. God has be&s;towed a large mea&s;ure of gifts and gra|ces upon him, for the work he is engaged in, and has made him a cho&s;en ve&s;&s;el, to carry his name among the Gentiles, and to revive his work in &s;everal other churches. O that God may order his coming to poor Scotland, in &s;uch a cloudy time, for the &s;ame end! And who knows, but God might be entreated, if we could wre&s;tle with him, notwith&s;tanding all our provocations! Things appeared mo&s;t unlikely, in other places, &s;ome while ago, where now Chri&s;t is riding in triumph, going forth conquering and to conquer. This worthy youth, is &s;ingularly fitted to do the work of an Evangeli&s;t; and I have been long of opi|nion,

that it would be for the advantage of the world, were this &s;till to be a &s;tanding office in the church. And &s;eeing the Lord has &s;tirred him up to venture his life, reputation, and his all for Chri&s;t; refu&s;e the be&s;t benefices in his own coun|try, and run all hazards by &s;ea and land, and travel &s;o many thou&s;and miles to proclaim the glo|ry of Chri&s;t, and riches of his free-grace, of which he him&s;elf is a monument; and e&s;pecially, &s;eeing God has honoured him to do all this with &s;uch &s;ur|pri&s;ing &s;ucce&s;s, among &s;inners of all ranks and per|&s;ua&s;ions, and even many of the mo&s;t notorious, in awakening and turning them to the Lord; I truly think we are al&s;o bound to honour him, and to e&s;teem him highly in love for his ma&s;ter's, and for his work's &s;ake, according to 1 The&s;&s;. v. 13. And for tho&s;e who vilify and oppo&s;e him, I wi&s;h they would even notice a Gamaliel's words, Acts v. 'Let him alone, le&s;t haply ye be found to &s;ight again&s;t God:' Or rather, that they would re|gard the Apo&s;tle Peter's words, apologizing for his going in with the uncircumci&s;ed, Acts xi. when the Holy Gho&s;t fell upon them; 'What was I that I could with&s;tand God?' I have my|&s;elf been witne&s;s to the Holy Gho&s;t falling upon him and his hearers oftener than once, I do not &s;ay in a miraculous, though in an ob&s;erveable manner. Yea, I have already &s;een the de&s;ireable fruits thereof in not a few; and hope, through the divine ble&s;&s;ing on the &s;eed &s;own, to &s;ee more. Many here are ble&s;&s;ing God, for &s;ending him to this country, though &s;atan has raged much again&s;t it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The Lord is a &s;overeign agent, and may rai&s;e up the in&s;truments of his glory, from what churches or places he plea&s;es; and glorifies his grace the more, when he does it from tho&s;e &s;ocieties, whence and when it could be lea&s;t expected.

Though Mr. Whitefield be ordained, according to his education, a Mini&s;ter of the Church of Eng|land; yet we are to regard him as one, whom God has rai&s;ed up, to witne&s;s again&s;t the corruptions of that church; whom God is &s;till enlightening, and cau&s;ing to make advances towards us. He has already conformed to us, both in doctrine and wor|&s;hip, and lies open to light to conform to us in other points. He is thoroughly a Calvini&s;t, and found to the doctrines of Free Grace, in the doc|trine of Original Sin, the New Birth, ju&s;tification by Chri&s;t, the nece&s;&s;ity of imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s, the operations of the Holy Gho&s;t, &amp;c. The&s;e he makes his great theme, drives the point home to the con&s;cience, and God attends it with great pow|er. And as God has enlightened him gradually in the&s;e things, &s;o he is &s;till ready to receive more light, and as &s;oon as he gets it, he is mo&s;t frank in declaring it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>God, by owning him &s;o wonderfully, is plea&s;ed to give a rebuke to our intemperate bigotry, and party-zeal, and to tell us, that neither circum|ci&s;ion nor uncircumci&s;ion availeth any thing. But a new creature.</Q>
<Q><HI>P. S.</HI> Many with us are for preferring Mini&s;ters, according to the party they are of, but commend me to a pious, Chri&s;t-exalt|ing, and &s;oul-winning Mini&s;ter, whatever be his denomination. Such are Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t's &s;ending, and of &s;uch he &s;aith, 'He that receiveth you, receiveth me, and he de&s;pi&s;eth you, de&s;pi&s;eth me;' which is a rule of duty to us.</Q></P>

<P><Q>Our journey to the north was as comfortable as any we had. In &s;everal places as he came along, the Lord countenanced him in a very convincing manner, particularly at a place called Lundie, five miles north from Dundee, where there is a con|&s;iderable number of &s;erious chri&s;tians, who hearing that he was to come that way, &s;pent mo&s;t part of the night before in prayer together. Although his preaching there was only in a pa&s;&s;ing way, having to ride to Dundee after it, and it was be|twixt three and four before he reached the place; yet he had but &s;carce well begun, before the pow|er of God was indeed very di&s;cernable. Never did I &s;ee &s;uch a plea&s;ing melting in a wor&s;hipping a&s;&s;embly. There was nothing violent in it, or like what we may call &s;crewing up the pa&s;&s;ions: for it evidently appeared to be deep and hearty, and to proceed from a higher &s;pring.</Q></P>
<P>The compiler lately received a tran&s;cript, from the diary of a very worthy chri&s;tian in Edinburgh, who died about two years ago, in which are the following pa&s;&s;ages.
<Q><HI>Sabbati,</HI> Augu&s;t 9, 1741. What is &s;ur|prizing, is, that numbers of all ranks, all denomi|nations, and all characters, come con&s;tantly to hear him, though his &s;ermons abound with tho&s;e truths which would be unwelcome from the mouth of others. He is indefatigable in his works. Three hours before noon he appoints, for people under di&s;tre&s;s to conver&s;e with him, when he is much confined. Then he writes numbers of let|ters. And this week he is to add a morning lecture to his work. I have rea&s;on, among many others, for ble&s;&s;ing God, for &s;ending him to this place.</Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>Sabbati,</HI> Augu&s;t 30, 1741. Mr. W&mdash; preach|ed Monday morning and afternoon, Tue&s;day forenoon in the Canongate church, evening in

the park, and gathered 25 l. 7s. 6d. for the poor Highlanders. Next day he went to Newbottle, and preached twice. On Thur&s;day to Whitburn; Friday morning at Torphichen; Friday evening at Linlithgow; Saturday morning and afternoon both at Falkirk. And this day he is at Airth. To|morrow he will preach twice at Sirling. Culro&s;s, Tue&s;day forenoon; Dumfermlin, afternoon. Wed|ne&s;day, twice at Kinro&s;s. Thur&s;day, Perth. From Friday to Monday, at Dundee. Monday, Kingla&s;|&s;ie, and came to Edinburgh on Tue&s;day. Ble&s;&s;ed be God, he &s;eldom preaches without &s;ome one or other laid under concern. Surely God has &s;ent him to this place for good. The devil never raged more by his emi&s;&s;aries. It is remarkable, there never was a Mini&s;ter, no nor any other man, again&s;t whom the mouths of the licentious have been more opened. Since he came, I have found my&s;elf more de&s;irous to be watchful, le&s;t my foot &s;lipt at any time, and to guard again&s;t many things, which before I thought indifferent.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Thur&s;day, October 29, 1741. Ye&s;terday Mr. Whitefield left this place, to return to England. His departure was a great grief to many, whom the Lord has mercifully awakened, under his mi|ni&s;try, the number of which, I believe, is very great. Mr. W&mdash;r alone, among about thirty young communicants that came to conver&s;e with him, found about a dozen, who told him, They were fir&s;t effectually touched under his mini&s;try; and gave very good accounts of a work of God upon their &s;ouls. Some of the mo&s;t abandoned wretches are brought to cry, 'What &s;hall I do to be &s;aved?' I have often had the opportunity of conver&s;ation with him, and, I think, I never heard him, or conver&s;ed with him, but I learn|ed &s;ome good le&s;&s;on. I do not remember to have heard one idle word drop from him, in all the times I have been in company with him, and
<PB N="106" REF="013298_0106_0F904E85B27F75B0">
others that have been much more with him, give him the &s;ame te&s;timony. On Tue&s;day la&s;t, he preached and exhorted &s;even times. I heard him to my great &s;atisfaction the fourth time, in the park. From that he went to the Old People's Ho&s;pi|tal, to give them an exhortation; but indeed, I never was witne&s;s to any thing of the kind before. All the congregation (for many followed him) were &s;o moved, that very few, if any, could refrain from crying out. I am &s;ure, the kingdom of God was then come nigh unto them, and that a woe will be unto them that &s;lighted the offers of a Sa|viour then made to them. From that, he went to Heriot's Ho&s;pital, where a great change is wrought, upon many of the boys; for there, as well as in the Maiden-Ho&s;pitals, fellow&s;hip-meetings are &s;et up, which is quite new there; for the boys of that Ho&s;pital were noted for the wickede&s;t boys about town. I was with him in a private hou&s;e in the evening. When he came there, he was quite worn out. However, he expounded there, which was the &s;eventh di&s;cour&s;e that day; and, what was very &s;urprizing, he was much fre&s;her after he had done, than at the beginning.</Q></P>
<P><Q>November 29, 1741, I had agreeable accounts of &s;ome of the children who were wrought upon by the mini&s;try of Mr. W&mdash;d. I heard this day of a good many I heard not of formerly, who were not only laid under concern, but &s;eem|ed to have a work of grace wrought upon their heart, appearing by a mo&s;t remarkable change in their conver&s;ation, and eager de&s;ires after far|ther degrees of knowledge of the Lord's ways, which leads them to attend every opportunity they can have for in&s;truction.</Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>Sabbati,</HI> December 6, 1741. Since Mr. White|field's coming here, I find chri&s;tians freer in con|ver&s;ation than formerly; which is a great mercy, both to them&s;elves, and all about them; the ex|perience
<PB N="107" REF="013298_0107_0F904E866657FAA0">
of which I have had this by pa&s;t week, in &s;everal places where I have been. I had occa&s;ion to &s;ee a &s;oldier, who was lately wrought upon by Mr. Whitefield's means. He &s;eems to have come a great length in a little time, and gives a very judicious account of the Lord's dealings with his &s;oul.</Q></P>
<P>As a conclu&s;ion of this article, concerning Mr. Whitefield's fir&s;t reception and mini&s;trations in Scot|land, the reader will not be di&s;plea&s;ed to &s;ee the fol|lowing extract from the papers of a Gentleman decea&s;|ed, who was eminent for his learning and knowledge of the world, and who had a general acquaintance with tho&s;e who profe&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t regard to religion.</P>
<P><Q>Me&s;&s;ieurs Ebenezer and Ralph Er&s;kine corre&s;|ponded with him for two or three years, and invited him to Scotland. But afterwards reflect|ing that if they held communion with an epi&s;copal Mini&s;ter, becau&s;e a good man and &s;ucce&s;sful preacher, they could not vindicate their renouncing commu|nion with &s;uch Mini&s;ters in the Church of Scot|land: They wrote to him not to come. Howe|ver, on the invitation of &s;ome Mini&s;ters and people of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church he came, and preached his fir&s;t &s;ermon in Mr. Ralph Er&s;kine's pulpit at Dumfermlin (a town ten or twelve miles from Edinburgh on the other &s;ide of Forth.) At a &s;e|cond vi&s;it to Dumfermlin, he had a conference with all the &s;eceding brethren, where he ho|ne&s;tly avowed that he was a member of the Church of England, and as he thought the government and wor&s;hip of it lawful, was re&s;olved, unle&s;s violently thru&s;t out of it, to continue &s;o, rebuking &s;in and preaching Chri&s;t: And told them the reckoned the Solemn League and Covenant a &s;in|ful Oath, as too much narrowing the communi|nion of &s;aints, and that he could not &s;ee the di|vine

right of Pre&s;bytery. On this they came to a pre&s;byterial re&s;olution to have no more to do with him; and one of them preached a &s;ermon to &s;hew that one who held communion with the Church of England, or back&s;lidden Church of Scotland, could not be an in&s;trument of reformati|on. This, however, did not hinder multitudes, both of the Seceders and e&s;tabli&s;hed Church of Scotland, from hearing his &s;ermons. His &s;ound|ne&s;s in the faith, his &s;ervent zeal, and unwearied diligence for promoting the cau&s;e of Chri&s;t; the plainne&s;s and &s;implicity, the affection and warmth of his &s;ermons: and the amazing power that had accompanied them in many parts of England, and in almo&s;t all the North American colonies, joined to his meekne&s;s, humility, and truly can|did and catholic &s;pirit, convinced them there was rea&s;on to think well of him, and to counte|nance his mini&s;try. Conver&s;ions were become rare, little liveline&s;s was to be found even in real chri&s;tians, and bigottry and blind zeal were pro|ducing animo&s;ities and divi&s;ions, and turning away the attention of good men from matters of infi|nitely greater importance. In this &s;ituation, an animated preacher appears, &s;ingularly qualified to awaken the &s;ecure, to recover chri&s;tians to their fir&s;t love, and fir&s;t works, and to reconcile their affections one to another.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The epi&s;copal clergy gave him no counte|nance, though &s;ome few of their people did. And in the e&s;tabli&s;hed Church of Scotland, &s;ome of the more rigid Pre&s;byterians would not hold communion with him, on account of his con|nection with the Church of England, and his &s;eeming to a&s;&s;ume the office of an Evangeli&s;t, peculiar, in their apprehen&s;ion, to the fir&s;t ages of the church: while &s;ome, who affected to be thought more &s;en&s;ible, or more modi&s;h and polite,
<PB N="109" REF="013298_0109_0F904E88709FEFE0">
were mightily di&s;&s;atisfied with him for preaching the Calvini&s;t Doctrines of Election, Original Sin, Efficacious Grace, Ju&s;tification through Faith, and the Per&s;everance of the Saints; and for inveighing again&s;t the play-hou&s;e, dancing a&s;&s;emblies, games of chance, haunting taverns, vanity and extrava|gance in dre&s;s, and levity in behaviour and con|ver&s;ation.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Some Gentlemen and Ladies who went to hear, would not go a &s;econd time, becau&s;e he di&s;turbed them, by in&s;i&s;ting on man's mi&s;erable and dange|rous &s;tate by nature, and the &s;trictne&s;s and holi|ne&s;s e&s;&s;ential to the chri&s;tian character. But upon many of his hearers in Edinburgh of all ranks and ages, e&s;pecially young people, deep impre&s;&s;ions were made, and many of them waited on him pri|vately, lamenting their former immoral lives, or &s;tupid thoughtle&s;sne&s;s about religion, and expre&s;|&s;ing their anxious concern about obtaining an in|tere&s;t in Chri&s;t, and the &s;anctifying influences of of the Spirit. In the greate&s;t part of the&s;e, the impre&s;&s;ions have appeared to be &s;aving, from their circum&s;pect examplary conduct &s;ince that time, or from their comfortable, or triumphant deaths. Many Pre&s;byterians begin to think more mildly and candidly than before, of the Mini&s;ters and members of the Church of England<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This year 1741, he received the compliment honorary Burge&s;s tickets from the towns of Stirling, Gla&s;gow, Pai&s;ley, and Aberdeen.

<Q>She has been a hou&s;e-keeper many years, once gay, but for three years la&s;t pa&s;t, a de&s;pi&s;ed follower of the Lamb of God.</Q>
From Abergavenny he went to Bri&s;tol, where he preached twice a day with his u&s;ual &s;ucce&s;s. Upon returning to London in the beginning of December, he receiv|ed letters from Georgia concerning his orphan-family, which, with re&s;pect to their external circum&s;tances, were a little di&s;couraging. On the other hand, he had mo&s;t comfortable accounts of the fruits of his mini&s;try in Scotland. This made him think of pay|ing another vi&s;it there in the &s;pring. Meantime, he had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing his labours attended with the divine ble&s;&s;ing at London and Bri&s;tol. And from Glouce&s;ter he thus writes,
<Q>December 22, 1741. La&s;t Thur&s;day evening the Lord brought me hi|ther. I preached immediately to our friends in in a large barn, and had my Ma&s;ter's pre&s;ence. On Friday and Saturday, I preached again twice. Both the power and the congregation increa&s;ed. On Sunday Providence opened a door for my preaching in St. John's, one of the pari&s;h churches.

Great numbers came. On Sunday afternoon, af|ter I had preached twice at Glouce&s;ter, I preach|ed at Mr. F&mdash;'s at the hill, &s;ix miles off, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gain at night, at Stroud. The people &s;eemed to be more hungry than ever, and the Lord to be more among&s;t them. Ye&s;terday morning I preached at Pain&s;wick in the pari&s;h church, here in the af|ternoon, and again at night in the barn. God gives me un&s;peakable comfort, and uninterrupted joy. Here &s;eems to be a new awakening, and a re|vival of the work of God. I find &s;everal country peo|ple were awakened when I preached at Tewk&s;bury, and heard of three or four that have died in the Lord. We &s;hall never know what good field-preaching has done, till we come to judgment. Many who were pre|judiced again&s;t me, begin to be of another mind; and God &s;hows me more and more, that when a man's ways plea&s;e the Lord, he will make even his enemies to be at peace with him. Tomorrow morning I purpo&s;e to &s;et out for Abergavenny, and to preach at Bri&s;tol, in Wilts, Glouce&s;ter, and Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, before I &s;ee London.</Q></P>

<P>On his way to London, Feb. 23, he was &s;till far|ther encouraged by receiving letters from Ameri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> informing him of the remarkable &s;ucce&s;s of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">+pel there, and that God had &s;tirred up &s;ome wealthy friends to a&s;&s;i&s;t his orphans in their late &s;traits.

<P>Upon his return to London, he went on with greater zeal and &s;ucce&s;s, if po&s;&s;ible, than ever.
<Q>Our Saviour (&s;ays he, writing to a brother <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Letter CCCCVII.</NOTE>, April 6, 1742) is doing great things in London daily. I rejoice to hear that you are helped in your work. Let this encourage you: go on, go on; the more we do, the more we may do for Je&s;us. I &s;leep and eat but little, and am con&s;tantly employed from morning till midnight, and yet my &s;trength is dai|ly renewed. O free grace! It fires my &s;oul, and makes me long to do &s;omething for Je&s;us. It is true, indeed I want to go home; but here are &s;o many &s;ouls ready to peri&s;h for lack of knowledge, that I am willing to tarry below as long as my Ma&s;ter has work for me.</Q></P>
<P>From this principle of compa&s;&s;ion to peri&s;hing &s;ouls, he now ventured to take a very extraordinary &s;tep. It had been the cu&s;tom for many years pa&s;t, in the holiday &s;ea&s;ons, to erect booths in Moorfields, for mountebanks, players, puppet &s;hows, &amp;c. which were attended from morning till night, by innumerable multitudes of the lower &s;ort of people. He formed a re&s;olution to preach the go&s;pel among them; and executed it. On Whitmonday, at &s;ix o'clock in the morning, attended by a large congregation of pray|ing
<PB N="113" REF="013298_0113_0F904E8AA48AE390">
people, he began. Thou&s;ands, who were wait|ing there, gaping for their u&s;ual diver&s;ions, all flock|ed round him. His text was, John iii. 14.
<Q>And as Mo&s;es lifted up the &s;erpent in the wilderne&s;s, even &s;o mu&s;t the Son of man be lifted up.</Q>
They gazed, they li&s;tened, they wept: and many &s;eemed to be &s;tung with deep conviction for their pa&s;t &s;ins. All was hu&s;hed and &s;olemn.
<Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. S. and Letters CCCCXI. CCCCXII.</NOTE> Being thus encouraged, (&s;ays he) I ventured out again at noon, when the fields were quite full; and could &s;carce help &s;mil|ing, to &s;ee thou&s;ands, when a merry-andrew was trumpeting to them, upon ob&s;erving me mount a &s;tand on the other &s;ide of the field, de&s;erting him, till not &s;o much as one was left behind, but all flocked to hear the go&s;pel. But this, together with a complaint that they had taken near twenty or thirty pounds le&s;s that day than u&s;ual, &s;o en|raged the owners of the booths, that when I came to preach a third time in the evening, in the mid&s;t of the &s;ermon, a merry-andrew got up upon a man's &s;houlders, and advancing near the pulpit, attempted to &s;la&s;h me with a long heavy whip &s;e|veral times. Soon afterwards they got a recruit|ing &s;erjeant, with his drum, &amp;c. to pa&s;s through the congregation. But I de&s;ired the people to make way for the King's officer, which was quiet|ly done. Finding the&s;e efforts to fail, a large body, quite on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, a&s;&s;embled together, and having got a great pole for their &s;tandard, advan|ced with &s;ound of drum, in a very threatening manner, till they came near the &s;kirts of the con|gregation. Uncommon courage was given both to preacher and hearers. I prayed for &s;upport and deliverance, and was heard. For ju&s;t as they ap|proached us with looks full of re&s;entment, I know not by what accident, they quarrelled among them|&s;elves, threw down their &s;taff, and went their way,
<PB N="114" REF="013298_0114_0F904E8D132DF538">
leaving, however, many of their company behind, who, before we had done, I tru&s;t were brought over to join the be&s;ieged party. I think I conti|nued in praying, preaching, and &s;inging, (for the noi&s;e was too great at times to preach) about <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> hours. We then retired to the Tabernacle, where thou&s;ands flocked. We were determined to pray down the booths; but ble&s;&s;ed be God, more &s;ub|&s;tantial work was done. At a moderate computa|tion, I received, I believe, a thou&s;and notes from per&s;ons under conviction; and &s;oon after, upwards of three hundred were received into the &s;ociety in one day. Some I married, that had lived together without marriage. One man had exchanged his wife for another, and given fourteen &s;hillings in exchange. Numbers, that &s;eemed as it were to have been bred up for Tyburn, were at that time plucked as firebrands out of the burning.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I cannot help adding, that &s;everal little boys and girls, who were fond of &s;itting round me on the pulpit, while I preached, and handing to me peo|ple's notes, though they were often pelted with eggs, dirt, &amp;c. thrown at me, never once gave way; but on the contrary, every time I was &s;truck, turned up their little weeping eyes, and &s;eemed to wi&s;h they could receive the blows for me. God make them, in their growing years, great and liv|ing martyrs for him, who out of the mouths of babes and &s;ucklings perfects prai&s;e.</Q></P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. X.</HI> From his Arrival in <HI>SCOTLAND 1742,</HI> to his Return to <HI>LONDON</HI> the &s;ame Year.</HEAD>
<P>SOON after this, he embarked a &s;econd time for Scotland and arrived at Leith, June 3, 1742.</P>
<P>From the Diary, formerly quoted, we have the following,
<Q>Edinburgh, Sabbath, June 6, 1742. On Thur&s;day la&s;t our dear friend Mr. Whitefield returned to this place, to the great comfort of many hone&s;t chri&s;tians, e&s;pecially of tho&s;e to whom he was made a mean of conviction and conver&s;ion when la&s;t here.&mdash;He &s;eems to have improved much in chri&s;tian knowledge. He is much refre&s;hed with the accounts of the work of God in the we&s;t country. I have heard him preach five excellent di&s;cour&s;es, all calculated for the building up of chri&s;tians, (though he never fails to put in a word for the conviction of &s;inners) and I think, can &s;ay, that I have never heard him without &s;ome influence attending his preaching, e&s;pecially in private hou&s;es. O may the impre&s;&s;ions made on my heart never wear off, le&s;t at any time I &s;hould be in danger of dropping my watch, and becoming untender.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Sabb. Oct. 17, 1742. It is a great recommen|dation of Mr. Whitefield to me, that though the Seceders give him every bad character that can be devi&s;ed, viz. a &s;orcerer, &amp;c. yet he takes all pa|tiently, and wherever he goes, &s;peaks well of them, &s;o far as he can: for none can approve of tho&s;e gro&s;s parts of their conduct: therefore the&s;e he choo&s;es to ca&s;t a mantle of love over.</Q></P>
<P>But here it is proper to take a view of the &s;tate of
<PB N="116" REF="013298_0116_0F904E8DE7AEC870">
things in that country upon his arrival. It had plea&s;ed God to ble&s;s his fir&s;t vi&s;it to Scotland, not only for the conver&s;ion of particular per&s;ons, and the com|fort and quickening of private chri&s;tians, but to rou&s;e them to more than ordinary concern about the &s;alva|tion of their neighbours, and to excite pious and con|&s;cientious Mini&s;ters to greater diligence in their work. Prayers were put up, with &s;ome degree of faith and hope, that God would now give &s;ucce&s;s to their la|bours; and not &s;uffer them always to complain that they &s;pent their &s;trength in vain. Nor were the&s;e prayers long unan&s;wered: for in the month of Febru|ary, 1742, an extraordinary religious concern began to appear publicly at Cambu&s;lang; and &s;oon after at Kil&s;yth and other places; the news of which quickly &s;pread through the land, and engaged general atten|tion. Of this, a ju&s;t though &s;hort de&s;cription is gi|ven in the following letter, written by the Rev. Mr. Hamilton (then Mini&s;ter in the Barony pari&s;h, now in the High-Church of Gla&s;gow) to Mr. Prince, Mini&s;ter in Bo&s;ton <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prince's Chri&s;tian Hi&s;tory, No. x.</NOTE>.
<Q>Gla&s;gow, September 13, 1742. We in the &s;outh and we&s;t of Scotland, have great rea&s;on to join in thankfulne&s;s to God, with you, for the days of the Redeemer's power that we are favoured with. Mr. Whitefield came to Scotland in &s;ummer 1741, for the fir&s;t time: and in many places where he preached, his mini|&s;trations were evidently ble&s;&s;ed, particularly in the cities of Edinburgh and Gla&s;gow, where a con&s;i|derable number of per&s;ons were brought under &s;uch impre&s;&s;ions of religion, as have never yet left them; but they are &s;till following on to know the Lord. However, this was only the beginning of far greater things: for about the middle of Febru|ary la&s;t, a very great concern appeared among the people of Cambu&s;lang, a &s;mall pari&s;h, lying four miles &s;outh-ea&s;t of Gla&s;gow, under the pa&s;toral in|&s;pection
<PB N="117" REF="013298_0117_0F904E8FCF50C6C0">
of the Rev. Mr. William MacCulloch, a man of con&s;iderable parts and great piety. This concern appeared with &s;ome circum&s;tances very unu&s;ual among us: to wit, &s;evere bodily agonies, outcryings, and faintings in the congregation. This made the report of it &s;pread like fire, and drew va&s;t multitudes of people from all quar|ters to that place. And I believe, in le&s;s than two months after the commencement of it, there were few pari&s;hes within twelve miles of Cambu&s;|lang, but had &s;ome, more or fewer awakened there, &s;o a very deep piercing &s;en&s;e of &s;in: and many at much greater di&s;tance. I am verily per|&s;uaded with your worthy brother Mr. Cooper, in his preface to Mr. Edwards's &s;ermon, that God has made u&s;e of the&s;e uncommon circum&s;tances, to make his work &s;pread the fa&s;ter. But, ble&s;&s;ed be God, Cambu&s;lang is not the only place where the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions are got. The &s;ame work is &s;preading in other pari&s;hes, and under their own Mini&s;ters, particularly at Calder, Kil&s;yth, and Cumbernaud, all to the north, and north-ea&s;t of Gla&s;gow. And I doubt not, that &s;ince the middle of February, when this work began at Cambu&s;lang, there are upwards of two thou&s;and per&s;ons awaken|ed, and almo&s;t all of them, by the be&s;t accounts I have, in a promi&s;ing condition: there being very few in&s;tances of impo&s;tors, or &s;uch as have lo&s;t their impre&s;&s;ions; and many whom we are bound to think are true Scripture converts, and evidencing it by a &s;uitable walk and conver&s;ation. There is evidently a greater &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and con|cern about religion appearing in mo&s;t of our con|gregations, than formerly: a greater de&s;ire after the word; people applying them&s;elves more clo&s;e|ly to their duty; and erecting new &s;ocieties for prayer and &s;piritual conference: which gives us
<PB N="118" REF="013298_0118_0F904E9118CCEC38">
the joyful pro&s;pect of a con&s;iderable enlargement of the Me&s;&s;iah's kingdom.</Q></P>
<P><Q>My pari&s;h has likewi&s;e had &s;ome &s;hare in this good work. There has been above an hundred new communicants among them this &s;ummer, who never did partake of the ble&s;&s;ed &s;acrament before: which is five times as many as ever I admitted in any former year: mo&s;t of them were awakened at Cambu&s;lang; &s;ome of them in their own church; and in others the impre&s;&s;ions have been more gra|dual, and not attended with the&s;e uncommon cir|cum&s;tances before mentioned. And, it is to be ob|&s;erved, that before we admit any per&s;on to the Lord's table, we particularly examine them, and are &s;atisfied with their knowledge of the principles of religion, of the nature and ends of the &s;acra|ment, and the impre&s;&s;ions of religion they have on their minds.</Q></P>
<P>To the &s;ame purpo&s;e is the Rev. Mr. Willi&s;on's letter to Dr. Colman, Mini&s;ter in Bo&s;ton, dated Dun|de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, Feb. 28, 1743.
<Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prince's Chri&s;tian Hi&s;tory, No. XI.</NOTE> I mu&s;t inform you a little of the work of God begun here. I told you in my la&s;t, that after Mr. Whitefield's fir&s;t coming and preaching three months in Scotland, there were &s;ome beginnings of a revival of religion in &s;ome of our principal cities, as Edinburgh and Gla&s;gow, which &s;till continue and increa&s;e, e&s;peci|ally &s;ince Mr. Whitefield's &s;econd coming in June la&s;t. But be&s;ides the&s;e cities, the Lord hath been plea&s;ed to begin a work much like that in New-England, in &s;everal places in the we&s;t of Scotland. The fir&s;t pari&s;h awakened, was Cambu&s;lang; the next was the pari&s;h of Kil&s;yth, about nine miles north ea&s;t of Gla&s;gow, and afterward the pari&s;hes of Calder, Kirkintilloch, Cumbernaud, Camp&s;ie, Kil|marneck, Gargunnock, and a great many others in the country. The awakenings of people have been, in a good many, attended with outcryings,
<PB N="119" REF="013298_0119_0F8FFAB5C9BD9B48">
faintings, and bodily di&s;tre&s;&s;es: but in many more, the work has proceeded with great calmne&s;s. But the effects in both &s;orts are alike good and de|&s;irable, and hitherto we hear nothing of their fall|ing back from what they have profe&s;&s;ed at the be|ginning: and &s;till we hear of &s;ome new pari&s;hes falling under great concern here and there, though the great cryings and outward di&s;tre&s;&s;es are much cea&s;ed.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The Lord, in this back&s;liding time, is willing to pity us, and &s;ee our ways and heal them, however crooked and perver&s;e they have been. O &s;hall not this wonderful &s;tep of divine conde&s;cen&s;ion, lead us all to repentance, and to go out to meet a re|turning God, in the way of humiliation and refor|mation. The Magi&s;trates and Mini&s;ters in Edin|burgh, are beginning to &s;et up &s;ocieties for refor|mation of manners, and new lectures on week days. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ay all our cities follow their example. There is a great increa&s;e of praying &s;ocieties al&s;o in Edin|burgh and other towns and villages; and in them they are keeping days of thank&s;giving for the par|tial waterings the Lord is giving us: tho&s;e in Edinburgh &s;end printed memorials to others thro' the nation, to excite them to it.</Q></P>
<P>The Rev. Mr. Macknight of Irvine, thus writes to Mr. Whitefield, June 21, 1742.
<Q>Ble&s;&s;ed be our glo|rious God, there are &s;ome awakenings among&s;t us at Irvine; not only of tho&s;e who have been at Cambu&s;lang, but &s;everal others are lately brought into great concern about their eternal &s;tate, and among them &s;everal children; the news of which I know will rejoice you, and I hope will encourage you to vi&s;it us, to help forward this great and glo|rious work of converting &s;inners.</Q></P>

<Q>Edinburgh, February, 1772. I would not a&s;cribe all the revival of religion in

Scotland, to the in&s;trumentality of Mr. Whitefield. At Cambu&s;lang, it began, before he had been there; but in Edinburgh, and all the other places in Scotland, that I heard of, after diligent enqui|ry, it began with <HI>his</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t vi&s;it. This honour he had from his divine Ma&s;ter, and it ought not to be taken from him. And every time he came to Scotland, it is an undoubted fact, that an uncom|mon power attended his mini&s;try: and many were always brought under &s;erious and la&s;ting impre&s;|&s;ions.</Q></P>
<P>The greate&s;t &s;trangers to religion could not avoid hearing of the&s;e things, but they were very different|ly affected with them. Whil&s;t &s;ome became more thoughtful and &s;erious, many mocked, and &s;ome were even filled with rage. On the other hand, the tem|per and behaviour of tho&s;e who were the &s;ubjects of this remarkable work, was the &s;tronge&s;t of all argu|ments that it came from above. Their earne&s;t de&s;ire to be rightly directed in the way to heaven; their tender and con&s;cientious walk; their faithfulne&s;s in the duties of their &s;tations; their readine&s;s to make ample re&s;titution for any act of inju&s;tice they had for|merly committed; their di&s;po&s;ition to judge mildly of others, but &s;everely of them&s;elves; their laying a&s;ide quarrels and law-&s;uits, and de&s;iring to be reconciled, and to live peaceably with all men; &s;uch amiable and heavenly qualities, e&s;pecially when appearing in &s;ome who had formerly been of a very oppo&s;ite cha|racter, could not fail to &s;trike every &s;erious ob&s;erver.

Though I am not very &s;olicitous what the world &s;ay of me, yet I would not refu&s;e to give any one, much le&s;s a Mini&s;ter of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, (and &s;uch an one I take you to be) all rea&s;onable &s;atisfaction about any part of my doctrine or conduct. I am &s;orry that the a&s;&s;ociate pre&s;bytery, be&s;ides the other things exceptionable in the grounds of their late fa&s;t, have done me much wrong. As to what they &s;ay about the &s;u|premacy, my &s;entiments, as to the power and au|thority of the civil magi&s;trate as to &s;acred things, agree with what is &s;aid in the We&s;tmin&s;ter Confe&s;|&s;ion of Faith, chap. xxiii. paragraph 3 and 4. And I do own the Lord Je&s;us to be the ble&s;&s;ed head and king of his church.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The Solemn League and Covenant I never ab|jured, neither was it ever propo&s;ed to me to be ab|jured: and as for my mi&s;&s;ives, if the a&s;&s;ociate pre&s;|bytery will be plea&s;ed to print them, the world will &s;ee that they had no rea&s;on to expect I would act in any other manner than I have done. What that part of my experience is, that &s;avours of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t enthu&s;ia&s;m, I know not, becau&s;e not &s;pe|cified; but this one thing I know, when I conver&s;|ed with them, they were &s;atisfied with the account I then gave of my experiences, and al&s;o of the validity of my mi&s;&s;ion; only, when they found I would preach the Go&s;pel promi&s;cuou&s;ly to all, and for every Mini&s;ter that would invite me, and not adhere only to them, one of them particularly &s;aid, 'They were &s;atisfied with all the other accounts which I gave of my&s;elf, except of my call to Scot|land at that time.' They would have been glad of my help, and have received me as a Mini&s;ter of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, had I con&s;ented to have preached only at the invitation of them and their people.

But I judged that to be contrary to the dictates of my con&s;cience; and therefore I could not comply. I thought their foundation was too narrow for any high hou&s;e to be built upon. I declared freely when la&s;t in Scotland (and am more and more con|vinced of it &s;ince) that they were building a Babel<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The event verified this conjecture. In his M. S. notes, &s;everal years after, he makes the following remark:
<Q>Such a work (the religious concern at Cambu&s;lang) &s;o very exten&s;ive, mu&s;t meet with great oppo&s;ition. My collections for the orphans gave a great handle; but the chief oppo&s;ition was made by the Seceders, who, though they had pray|ed for me at the mo&s;t extravagant rate, now gave out that I was agitated by the devil. Taking it for granted, that all converted per&s;ons mu&s;t take the covenant, and that God had left the Scotch e&s;tabli&s;hed churches long ago, and that he would never work by the hands of a curate of the Church of England, they condemned the whole work, as the work of the devil; and kept a fa&s;t through all Scotland, to humble them&s;elves, becau&s;e the devil was come down in great wrath, and to pray that the Lord would rebuke the de&s;troyer (for that was my title.) But the Lord rebuked the&s;e good men; for they &s;plit among them&s;elves, and excommuni|cated one another. Having afterwards a &s;hort in|terview with Mr. Ralph Er&s;kine, we embraced each other, and he &s;aid, We had &s;een &s;trange things.</Q></NOTE>. At the &s;ame time, they knew very well, I was very far from being again&s;t all church-government (for how can any church &s;ub&s;i&s;t without it?) I only urged, as I do now, that &s;ince holy men differ &s;o much about the outward form, we &s;hould bear with, and forbear one another, though in this re&s;pect we are not of one mind. I have often declared in
<PB N="124" REF="013298_0124_0F904E95896CA4B8">
the mo&s;t public manner, that I believe the Church of Scotland to be the be&s;t con&s;tituted national church in the world. At the &s;ame time I would bear with, and conver&s;e freely with all others, who do not err in fundamentals, and who give evidence that they are true lovers of the Lord Je&s;us. This is what I mean by a catholic &s;pirit. Nor that I believe a Jew or Pagan continuing &s;uch, can be a true chri&s;tian, or have true chri&s;tianity in them; and if there be any thing tending that way in the late extract which I &s;ent you, I utterly di&s;avow it. And I am &s;ure, I ob&s;erved no &s;uch thing in it, when I publi&s;hed it, though upon a clo&s;er review, &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions &s;eem ju&s;tly exceptionable. You know how &s;trongly I a&s;&s;ert all the doctrines of grace as held forth in the We&s;tmin&s;ter Confe&s;|&s;ion of Faith, and doctrinal articles of the Church of England. The&s;e I tru&s;t I &s;hall adhere to as long as I live, becau&s;e I verily believe they are the truths of God, and have felt the power of them in my own heart. I am only concerned that good men &s;hould be guilty of &s;uch mi&s;repre&s;enta|tions. But this teaches me more and more to exerci&s;e compa&s;&s;ion toward all the children of God, and to be more jealous over our own hearts, knowing what fallible creatures we all are. I ac|knowledge that I am a poor blind &s;inner, liable to err, and would be obliged to an enemy, much more to &s;o dear a friend as you are, to point out to me my mi&s;takes, as to my practice, or unguarded expre&s;&s;ions in my preaching or writing. At the &s;ame time, I would humble my&s;elf before my Ma&s;ter, for any thing I may &s;ay or do ami&s;s, and beg the influence and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his ble&s;&s;ed Spirit, that I may &s;ay and do &s;o no more.</Q></P>

Three of the little boys that were converted when I was la&s;t here, came to me and wept, and begged me to pray for and with them.

At Edinburgh he preached twice a day, as u&s;ual, in the Ho&s;pital park, where a number of &s;eats and &s;hades, in the form of an amphitheatre, were erected for the ac|commodation of his hearers. And in con&s;equence of earne&s;t invitations, he went to the we&s;t country, particularly to Cambu&s;lang, where he preached no le&s;s than three times upon the very day of his arri|val, to a va&s;t body of people, although he had preached that &s;ame morning at Gla&s;gow. The la&s;t of the&s;e exerci&s;es he began at nine at night, continuing till eleven, when he &s;aid, he ob&s;erved &s;uch a commotion among the people, as he had never &s;een in America.

At the celebration of the holy commu|nion, their joy was &s;o great, that at the de&s;ire of many, both Mini&s;ters and people, in imitation of Hezekiah's pa&s;&s;over, they had, a month or two af|terwards, a &s;econd; which was a general rendez|vous of the people of God.

<P>February 1744, an event happened to him, which, amid&s;t all his &s;ucce&s;s, tended to keep him humble, and &s;erved to cure him of a weakne&s;s to which he had been liable, the tru&s;ting to groundle&s;s impre&s;&s;i|ons. It was the death of his only child, concerning whom he was &s;o impre&s;&s;ed, that he made no &s;cruple of declaring before the birth, that the child would be a &s;on, and that he hoped he would live to preach the go&s;pel. Several narrow e&s;capes which Mrs. White|field had during her pregnancy, confirmed him in his expectations; which were &s;o high, that after he had publicly baptized the child at the Tabernacle, all went away, big with hopes of his being &s;pared to be em|ployed in the work of God. But the&s;e fond expec|tations were &s;oon bla&s;ted by the child's death, when he was about four months old. This was, no doubt, very humbling to the father; but he was helped to make the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t improvement of it.

<P>March 3, he attended the a&s;&s;izes at Glouce&s;ter. The occa&s;ion was, in the Summer 1743, the Metho|di&s;ts had been per&s;ecuted and abu&s;ed by the mob, particularly at Hampton, where &s;everal were hurt, and the life of their preachers threatened. Mr. White|field having tried other methods in vain, re&s;olved with the advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his brethren, to &s;eek the protection of law: and accordingly got an information lodged again&s;t the Hampton rioters in the court of King's-Bench. Facts being proved by a variety of evidence, and the defendants making no reply, the rule was made ab&s;olute; and an information filed again&s;t them. To this they pleaded, Not Guilty, and therefore the cau&s;e was referred in cour&s;e to the a&s;&s;izes in Glouce&s;ter. There he attended and got the better of his adver&s;aries. After a full hearing on both &s;ides, a verdict was given for the pro&s;ecutors, and all the defendants were brought in Guilty of the whole information lodged again&s;t them. This pro&s;e|cution had a very good effect. The rioters were greatly alarmed at the thoughts of having an execu|tion i&s;&s;ued out again&s;t them. But the intention of the Methodi&s;ts was, to let them &s;ee what they could do, and then to forgive them <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Letter DXLIX, DL.&mdash;See an account of this trial in his works, vol.

<P>Some time before this, &s;everal anonymous papers, entitled,

about in the religious &s;ocieties of London and We&s;tmin&s;ter, and given to many private per&s;ons, with &s;trict injunctions to part with them to no one. Mr. Whitefield having accidentally had the ha&s;ty pe|ru&s;al of them; and finding many queries concerning him and his conduct contained in them; and having applied for a copy, which was refu&s;ed him, he thought it his duty to publi&s;h an adverti&s;ement, de&s;iring, (as he knew not how &s;oon he might embark for Geor|gia) a &s;peedy, open publication of the &s;aid papers, that he might make a candid and impartial an&s;wer. He had rea&s;on to believe the Bi&s;hop of London was concerned in compo&s;ing or revi&s;ing them: but that he might not be mi&s;taken, after the publication of the adverti&s;ement, he wrote the Bi&s;hop a letter, where|in he de&s;ired to know, whether his Lord&s;hip was the author or not; and al&s;o de&s;ired a copy. The Bi&s;hop &s;ent word, "He &s;hould hear from him." Some time after, one Mr. Owen, printer to the Bi&s;hop, left a letter for Mr. Whitefield, informing him that he had orders from &s;everal of the Bi&s;hops, to print the Ob|&s;ervations, &amp;c. with &s;ome few additions, for their u&s;e; and when the impre&s;&s;ion was fini&s;hed, Mr. White|field &s;hould have a copy.&mdash;For the&s;e rea&s;ons, Mr. Whitefield thought it proper to direct his An&s;wer to the Ob&s;ervations, to the Bi&s;hop of London, and the other Bi&s;hops concerned in the publication of them.

It is remarkable, that ju&s;t before his &s;uc|ce&s;s at Plymouth, he was in danger of being killed. Four Gentleman, it &s;eems, came to the hou&s;e of one of his particular friends, kindly enquiring after him, and de&s;iring to know where he lodged. Soon after|wards, Mr. Whitefield received a letter, informing him, that the writer was a nephew of Mr. S&mdash;, an Attorney at New-York; that he had the plea&s;ure of &s;upping with Mr. Whitefield at his uncle's hou&s;e; and de&s;ired his company to &s;up with him, and a few more friends, at a tavern. Mr. Whitefield &s;ent him word, that it was not cu&s;tomary for him to &s;up abroad at taverns, but &s;hould be glad of the Gentleman's

company to eat a mor&s;el with him at his lodging: he accordingly came and &s;upped; but was ob&s;erved fre|quently to look around him, and to be very ab&s;ent. At la&s;t he took his leave, and returned to his compa|nions in the tavern; and being by them interrogated, what he had done, he an&s;wered,
<Q>That he had been u&s;ed &s;o civilly, he had not the heart to touch him.</Q>
Upon which, it &s;eems, another of the company, a Lieutenant of a man of war, laid a wager of ten gui|neas, that he would do his bu&s;ine&s;s for him. His com|panions, however, had the precaution to take away his &s;word. It was now about midnight, and Mr. Whitefield having that day preached to a large con|gregation, and vi&s;ited the French pri&s;oners, was gone to bed: when the landlady came and told him that a well-dre&s;&s;ed gentleman de&s;ired to &s;peak with him, Mr. Whitefield, imagining it was &s;omebody under con|viction, de&s;ired him to be brought up. He came, and &s;at down by the bed &s;ide, congratulated him up|on the &s;ucce&s;s of his mini&s;try, and expre&s;&s;ed much concern at being detained from hearing him. Soon after he broke out into the mo&s;t abu&s;ive language, and in a cruel and cowardly manner, beat him in his bed. The landlady and her daughter hearing the noi&s;e, ru&s;hed into the room, and &s;eized upon him; but he &s;oon di&s;engaged him&s;elf from them, and re|peated his blows on Mr. Whitefield, who being ap|prehen&s;ive that he intended to &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oot or &s;tab him, un|derwent all the &s;urprize of a &s;udden and violent death.

<Q>Take courage, I am ready to help you.</Q>

What gave me mo&s;t concern was, that notice had been given of my being to preach. Whil&s;t the Doctor was preparing a me|dicine feeling my pains abated, I on a &s;udden cried, 'Doctor, my pains are &s;u&s;pended: by the help of God, I will go and preach, and then come home and die.' In my own apprehen&s;ion, and in all appearance to others, I was a dying man. I preached. The people heard me as &s;uch. The invi&s;ible realities of another world lay open to my view. Expecting to &s;tretch into eternity, and to be with my Ma&s;ter before the morning, I &s;poke with peculiar energy. Such effects followed the words, I thought it was worth dying for a thou&s;and times. Though wonderfully comforted within, at my return home, I thought I was dying indeed. I was laid on a bed upon the ground, near the fire, and I heard my friends &s;ay, 'He is gone.' But God was plea&s;ed to order it otherwi&s;e. I gra|dually recovered; and &s;oon after, a poor Negro-woman would &s;ee me. She came, &s;at down upon the ground, and looked earne&s;tly in my face, and then &s;aid, in broken language;</Q>

<P><Q>In about three weeks I was enabled, though in great weakne&s;s, to reach Bo&s;ton; and every day was more and more confirmed, in what I had heard about a glorious work, that had been begun and carried on there, and in almo&s;t all parts of New-England, for two years together. Before my la&s;t embarkation from Georgia, Mr. Colman, and Mr. Cooper, wrote me word, that upon Mr. Tenant's going out as an itinerant, the awakening greatly in|crea&s;ed in various places<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See Prince's Chri&s;tian Hi&s;tory, or hi&s;torical col|lections, &amp;c.

But as the &s;ame &s;un that enlightens and warms the earth, gives vent to noxious in&s;ects; &s;o the &s;ame work, that for a while carried all before it, was &s;adly blemi&s;hed through the &s;ubtility of &s;atan <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg">Thus it was at the Reformation in Germany.</NOTE>, and the want of more experience in Mini&s;ters and people, who had never &s;een &s;uch a &s;cene before.

every day, and the di&s;orders were al&s;o at the high|e&s;t; &s;o that for a while, my &s;ituation was rendered uncomfortable. But amid&s;t all this &s;moke, a ble&s;&s;ed fire broke out. The awakened &s;ouls were as eager as ever to hear the word. Having heard that I had expounded early in Scotland, they beg|ged I would do the &s;ame in Bo&s;ton. I complied, and opened a lecture at &s;ix in the morning. I &s;el|dom preached to le&s;s than two thou&s;and.

<P><Q>Saturday Nov. 24, 1744. The Rev. Mr. Whitefield was &s;o far revived, as to be able to &s;et out from Port&s;mouth to Bo&s;ton, whither he came in a very feeble &s;tate the Monday evening after: &s;ince which,
<PB N="144" REF="013298_0144_0F904EA7389565B8">
he has been able to preach in &s;everal of our large&s;t hou&s;es of public wor&s;hip, particularly the Rev. Dr. Colman's, Dr. Sewall's, Mr. Webb's, and Mr. Gee's, to crowded a&s;&s;emblies of people, and with great and growing acceptance. At Dr. Colman's de|&s;ire, and the con&s;ent of the church, on Lord's-day after his arrival, he admini&s;tered to them the Holy Communion. And la&s;t Lord's-day he preached for Mr. Cheever of Chel&s;ea, and admini&s;tered the Holy Supper there. The next day preached for the Rev. Mr. Emer&s;on of Malden. Ye&s;terday he &s;et out to preach at &s;ome towns to the northward, propo&s;es to return hither the next Wedne&s;day even|ing, and after a few days, to comply with the earne&s;t invitations of &s;everal Mini&s;ters to go and preach to their congregations in the &s;outhern parts of the province. He comes with the &s;ame extra-ordinary &s;pirit of meekne&s;s, &s;weetne&s;s, and univer|&s;al benevolence, as before. In oppo&s;ition to the &s;pi|rit of &s;eparation and bigotry, is &s;till for holding com|munion with all prote&s;tant churches. In oppo&s;i|tion to enthu&s;ia&s;m, he preaches a clo&s;e adherence to the Scriptures, the nece&s;&s;ity of trying all impre&s;|&s;ions by them, and of rejecting whatever is not agree|able to them, as delu&s;ions. In oppo&s;ition to An|tinomiani&s;m, he preaches up all kinds of relative and religious duties, though to be performed in the &s;trength of Chri&s;t: and in &s;hort, the doctrines of the church of England, and of the fir&s;t fathers of this country. As before, he fir&s;t applies him&s;elf to the under&s;tandings of his hearers, and then to the affections. And the more he preaches, the more he convinces people of their mi&s;takes about him, and increa&s;es their &s;atisfaction.</Q></P>
<P>It was now &s;pring 1745, and at that time the fir&s;t expedition was &s;et on foot again&s;t Cape Breton. Co|lonel Pepperell, who was then at Bo&s;ton, and con|&s;tantly attended Mr. Whitefield's lecture, was plea&s;|ed,
<PB N="145" REF="013298_0145_0F904EA931B7CC68">
the day before he accepted a commi&s;&s;ion, to be General in that expedition, to a&s;k Mr. Whitefield's opinion of the matter. He told him, with his u&s;ual frankne&s;s,
<Q>That he did not, indeed, think the &s;cheme propo&s;ed for taking Loui&s;burgh, very promi&s;ing: that the eyes of all would be upon him. It he did not &s;ucceed, the widows and or|phans of the &s;lain &s;oldiers, would be like lions robbed of their whelps; but if it plea&s;ed God to give him &s;ucce&s;s, envy would endeavour to eclip&s;e his glory; he had need, therefore, if he went, to go with a &s;ingle eye; and then, there was no doubt, but if Providence really called him, he would find his &s;trength proportioned to the day,</Q>
About the &s;ame time, Mr. Sherburne, another of Mr. White|field's friends, being appointed one of the commi&s;|&s;aries, told him,
<Q>He mu&s;t favour the expedition, otherwi&s;e the &s;erious people would be di&s;couraged from enli&s;ting; not only &s;o, but in&s;i&s;ted he &s;hould give him a motto for his flag, for the encourage|ment of the &s;oldiers.</Q>
This he refu&s;ed to do, as it would be acting out of character. But Mr. Sherburne would take no denial. He therefore, at la&s;t, gave them one, <HI>Nil de&s;perandum Chri&s;to Duce.</HI>
<Q>If Chri&s;t be Captain, no fear of a defeat.</Q>
Upon which great numbers enli&s;tened<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Letter DLXXII.</NOTE>. And before their em|barkation, the officers de&s;ired him to give them a &s;ermon. This he readily complied with, and preach|ed from the&s;e words:
<Q>As many as were di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, as many as were di&s;contented, as many as were in debt, came to David, and he became a Captain over them.</Q>
He &s;piritualized the &s;ubject, and told them, How di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;inners came to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the &s;on David; and in his application, exhorted the &s;oldiers to behave like the &s;oldiers of David, and the officers to act like David's worthies; then he made no manner of doubt, there would be good news from
<PB N="146" REF="013298_0146_0F904EA9C8647FA0">
Cape Breton. After this, he preached to the Gene|ral him&s;elf; who a&s;ked him, If he would not be one of his Chaplains? But he excu&s;ed him&s;elf, and &s;aid,
<Q>He &s;hould think it an honour, but believed, as he generally preached three times a day, in various places, to large congregations, he could do more &s;ervice by &s;tirring up the people to pray, and thereby &s;trengthening his, and his &s;oldiers hands.</Q>
And in this practice he per&s;i&s;ted during the &s;iege of Loui&s;burgh,
<Q>I believe, adds he<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">M. S. and Letter DLXXII.</NOTE>, if ever people went with a di&s;intere&s;ted view, the New-Englan|ders did then. Though many of them were raw and undi&s;ciplined, yet numbers were &s;ub&s;tantial per&s;ons who left their farms, and willingly ventur|ed all for their country's good. An amazing &s;cene of Providence appeared<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg">See Mr. Prince's Sermon on that occa&s;ion.</NOTE>, and though &s;ome di&s;couraging accounts were &s;ent during the latter end of the &s;iege; yet in about &s;ix weeks, news was brought of the &s;urrender of Loui&s;burgh.

<P>The New-England people had, &s;ome time ago, of|fered to build him a large hou&s;e to preach in; but as this &s;cheme might have abridged his liberty of itine|rating, he thanked them for their kind offer, and at the &s;ame time begged leave to refu&s;e the accepting of it<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="marg">Letter DLXVII.</NOTE>. As his bodily &s;trength increa&s;ed, and his health grew better, he began to move farther &s;outhward; and, after preaching ea&s;tward, as far as Ca&s;cobay and North Yarmouth, he went through Connecticut, Plymouth, Rhode-I&s;land, preaching to

<Q>there was much &s;moke, yet every day I had more and more convincing proof, that a ble&s;&s;ed Go&s;pel fire had been kindled in the hearts both of Mini&s;ters and people. At New-York, where I preached as u&s;ual, I found that the &s;eed &s;own, had &s;prung up abundantly: and at the ea&s;t-end of Long-I&s;land &s;aw many in&s;tances. In my way to Philadelphia, I had the plea&s;ure of preach|ing, by an interpreter, to &s;ome converted Indians, and of &s;eeing near fifty young ones in one &s;chool, near Free-hold, learning the A&s;&s;embly's Catechi&s;m. A ble&s;&s;ed awakening had been begun, and carried on among the Delaware Indians, by the in&s;trumen|tality of Mr. David Brainard<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg">See his Life and Journals.</NOTE>, &s;uch a one as hath not been heard of &s;ince the awakening in New-England by the venerable Mr. Elliot, who u&s;ed to be &s;tiled the Apo&s;tle of the Indians; his brothe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ol|lowed him.

<P><Q>His brother, Mr. Gilbert Tennent, being ear|ne&s;tly &s;olicited thereto, I found &s;ettled in the place formerly erected at the beginning of the awaken|ing. The Gentlemen offered me eight hundred pounds a year, only to preach among them &s;ix months, and to travel the other &s;ix months where I would. Nothing remarkable happened, during my way &s;outhward. But when I came to Virgi|nia, I found that the word of the Lord had run and was glorified. During my preaching at Gl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;|gow, &s;ome per&s;ons wrote &s;ome of my extempore &s;ermons, and printed them almo&s;t as fa&s;t as I preached them.

Samuel Morris. He read and found benefit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See more fully narrated Hi&s;t. Coll. Book IV. Chap. v. &sect;. 22.</NOTE>. He then read them to others; they were awaken|ed and convinced. A fire was kindled; oppo&s;i|tion was made; other labourers were &s;ent for; and many, both white people and negroes, were converted to the Lord.</Q></P>
<P><Q>In North Carolina, where I &s;tayed too &s;hort a time, little was done. At Georgia, through the badne&s;s of the in&s;titution, and the Tru&s;tees ob&s;ti|nacy in not altering it, my load of debt and care was greatly increa&s;ed, and at times almo&s;t overwhelmed me. But I had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing one, who came as a player from New-York, now converted unto God, and a preacher of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. One Mr. Ratteray brought me ten pounds: and at my return northward, fre&s;h &s;upplies were rai&s;ed up. The generous Charle&s;town people rai&s;ed a &s;ub&s;cription of three hundred pounds, with which I bought land, being cheap, during the war; and a plantation, and a few negroes were purcha&s;ed at Indian-Land. Thus, for a while, the gap was &s;topped. I preached a &s;ermon upon the rebellion. Was very &s;ick at Philadelphia; kindly received at Bohemia, and at New-York.</Q></P>
<P><Q>As itinerating was my delight, and America, as being a new world, particularly plea&s;ing, I now began to think of returning no more to my native country. But travelling, care, and a load of debt, contracted not for my&s;elf, but the Or|phan-hou&s;e, weighed me down. And being much troubled with &s;titches in my &s;ide, I was advi&s;ed to go to Bermudas, for the recovery of my health.</Q></P>

<P><Q>October 8. I have had &s;ome &s;weet times with &s;everal of the Lutheran Mini&s;ters at Philadel|phia.</Q></P>
<P><Q>November 8. I have lately been in &s;even coun|ties in Maryland, and preached to great congrega|tions.</Q></P>
<P><Q>May 21, 1747. I have now been upon the &s;tretch, preaching con&s;tantly for almo&s;t three weeks. My body is often extremely weak, but the joy of the Lord is my &s;trength; and by the help of God, I intend going on till I drop, or this poor carca&s;e can hold out no more. The &s;outh|ern colonies lie in darkne&s;s, and yet, as far as I find, are as willing to receive the Go&s;pel, as others. If &s;ome good books could be purcha&s;ed, to di&s;|po&s;e among poor people, much good might be done.</Q></P>
<P><Q>June 1. The congregations ye&s;terday were exceeding large. I am &s;ick and well, as I u&s;ed to be in England: but the Redeemer fills me with comfort. I am determined, in his &s;trength, to die fighting.</Q></P>
<P><Q>June 4. I have omitted preaching one night to oblige my friends, that they may not charge me with murdering my&s;elf; but I hope yet to die in the pulpit, or &s;oon after I come out of it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>June 23. Since my la&s;t, I have been &s;everal times on the verge of eternity. At pre&s;ent, I am &s;o weak that I cannot preach. It is hard work to be &s;ilent, but I mu&s;t be tried every way.</Q></P>
<P><Q>June 29. God has been plea&s;ed to bring my body to the very brink of the grave, by convul&s;i|ons, gravel, a nervous cholic, and a violent fever.

For this week pa&s;t, I have not preached: but &s;ince my leaving Philadelphia, about three days ago, I &s;eemed to have gathered &s;trength, and hope once more, to-morrow, to proclaim among&s;t poor &s;inners, the un&s;earchable riches of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.

<P>MR. Whitefield met with the kinde&s;t reception at Bermudas, and for above a month, he preached generally twice a day, traver&s;ing the I&s;land from one end to the other: but his activity, u&s;efulne&s;s, and treatment, will be&s;t appear by an extract from his manu&s;cript journal of that period.</P>
<P><Q>The &s;implicity and plainne&s;s of the people, to|gether with the plea&s;ant &s;ituation of the i&s;land, much delighted me.&mdash;The Rev. Mr. Holiday, Mini&s;ter of Spani&s;h-Point, received me in a mo&s;t affectionate chri&s;tian manner, and begged I would make his hou&s;e my home.&mdash;In the evening, I ex|pounded at the hou&s;e of Mr. Savage of Port-Roy|al, which was very commodious, and which al&s;o he would have me make my home.&mdash;I went with Mr. Savage, in a boat, lent us by Captain &mdash;, to the town of St. George, in order to pay our re&s;pects to the Governor. All along we had a mo&s;t plea&s;ant pro&s;pect of the other part of the i&s;|land; but a more plea&s;ant one I never &s;aw. One Mrs. Smith, of St. George's, for whom I had a letter of recommendation from my dear old friend Mr. Smith of Charle&s;town, received me into her hou&s;e. About noon, with one of the council and Mr. Savage, I waited upon the Governor. He received us courteou&s;ly, and invited us to dine with him and the Council at the tavern. We accepted the invitation, and all behaved with great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">civility and re&s;pect. After the Governor ro&s;e

from table, he de&s;ired, if I &s;tayed in town on the Sunday, that I would dine with him at his own hou&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Sunday, March 20. Read prayers, and preached twice this day, to what were e&s;teemed here large auditories, in the morning at Spani&s;h-Point church, and in the evening at Bracki&s;h-pond church, about two miles di&s;tant from each other. In the after|noon I &s;poke with greater freedom than in the morning, and I tru&s;t not altogether in vain. All were attentive&mdash;&s;ome wept. I dined with Colo|nel Butterfield, one of the council, and received &s;everal invitations to other Gentlemen's hou&s;es.&mdash; May God ble&s;s and reward them, and incline them to open their heart to receive the Lord Je&s;us! Amen and Amen!</Q></P>
<P><Q>Wedne&s;day, March 23. Dined with Captain Gibbs, and went from thence and expounded at the hou&s;e of Captain F&mdash;le, at Hunbay, about two miles di&s;tant. The company was here al&s;o large, attentive, and affected. Our Lord gave me utterance: I expounded on the fir&s;t part of the viiith chapter of Jeremiah. After lecture, Mr. Riddle, a Coun&s;ellor, invited me to his hou&s;e, as did Mr. Paul, an aged Pre&s;byterian Mini&s;ter, to his pulpit; which I complied with upon con|dition the report was true, that the Governor had &s;erved the Mini&s;ters with an injunction that I &s;hould not preach in the churches.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Friday March 25. Was prevented preaching ye&s;terday by the rain, which continued from morn|ing till night; but this afternoon God gave me an|other opportunity of declaring his eternal truths to a large company at the hou&s;e of one Mr. B&mdash;s, who la&s;t night &s;ent me a letter of invi|tation.</Q></P>

It has been a plea&s;ant one to mine. Both morn|ing and afternoon I preached to a large auditory, for Bermudas, in Mr. Paul's meeting-hou&s;e, which I &s;uppo&s;e contains above four hundred. Abun|dance of negroes, and many others, were in the ve&s;try, porch, and about the hou&s;e. The word &s;eemed to be clothed with a convincing power, and to make its way into the hearts of the hearers. Between &s;ermons, I was entertained very civilly in a neighbouring-hou&s;e: Judge Ba&s;come and three more of the Council came thither; each gave me an invitation to his hou&s;e.&mdash;O how does the Lord make way for a poor &s;tranger in a &s;trange land!&mdash; After the &s;econd &s;ermon, I dined with Mr. Paul, and in the evening expounded to a very large com|pany at Coun&s;ellor Riddle's.&mdash;My body was &s;ome|what weak, but the Lord carried me through, and cau&s;ed me to go to re&s;t rejoicing. May I thus go to my grave, when my cea&s;ele&s;s uninterrupted re&s;t &s;hall begin!</Q></P>
<P><Q>Monday, March 28. Dined this day at Mrs. D&mdash;l's, mother-in-law to my dear friend the Rev. Mr. Smith; and afterwards preached to more than a large hou&s;e full of people, on Matt. ix.12. 'They that be whole need not a Phy&s;ician, but they that are &s;ick.' Towards the conclu&s;ion of the &s;ermon, the hearers began to be more affected than I have yet &s;een them.&mdash;Surely the Lord Je&s;us will give me &s;ome &s;eals in this i&s;land! Grant this, O Redeemer, for thy infinite mercy's &s;ake!</Q></P>
<P><Q>Thur&s;day, March 31.

Gentlemen and other people, with my friend Mr. Holiday, who came from different quarters to hear me.&mdash;Before I began preaching, I went round to &s;ee a mo&s;t remarkable cave, which very much di&s;|played the exqui&s;ite workman&s;hip of Him, 'who in his &s;trength &s;etteth fa&s;t the mountains, and is girded about with power.' Whil&s;t I was in the cave, quite unexpectedly I turned and &s;aw Coun|&s;ellor Riddle, who with his &s;on came to hear me, and whil&s;t we were in the boat told me, that he had been with the Governor, who declared he had no per&s;onal prejudice again&s;t me, and wondered I did not come to town and preach there, for it was the de&s;ire of the people; and that any hou&s;e in the town, the Court-hou&s;e, not excepted, &s;hould be at my &s;ervice. Thanks be to God for &s;o much favour!&mdash;If his cau&s;e requires it, I &s;hall have more.&mdash;He knows my heart; I value the favour of man no farther than as its makes room for the Go&s;pel, and gives me a large &s;cope to promote the glory of God. There being no capacious hou&s;e upon the i&s;land, I preached for the fir&s;t time here in the open air. All heard very attentive, and it was very plea&s;ant after &s;ermon to &s;ee &s;o many boats full of people returning from the wor|&s;hip of God. I talked &s;eriou&s;ly to &s;ome in our own boat, and began to &s;ing a p&s;alm, in which they readily joined.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Sunday, April 3. Preached twice this day at Mr. Paul's meeting-hou&s;e, as on the la&s;t Sabbath, but with greater freedom and power, e&s;pecially in the morning, and I think to as great, if not greater auditories: Dined with Colonel H&mdash;vy, another of the Council; vi&s;ited a &s;ick woman, where many came to hear, and expounded after|wards to a great company at Capt. John Darrel's, Mrs. D&mdash;l's &s;on, who with his wife courteou&s;ly entertained me, and de&s;ired me to make his hou&s;e

<P><Q>Wedne&s;day, April 6. Preached ye&s;terday at the hou&s;e of Mr. Anthony Smith, of Baylis Bay, with a con&s;iderable degree of warmth, and rode after|wards to St. George's, the only town on the i&s;land. The gentlemen of the town had &s;ent mean invi|tation by Judge Ba&s;come, and he with &s;everal others came to vi&s;it me at my lodgings, and inform|ed me, that the Governor de&s;ired to &s;ee me.&mdash; About ten I waited upon his Excellency, who re|ceived me with great civility, and told me he had no objection again&s;t my per&s;on or my principles, having never yet heard me, and he knew nothing in re&s;pect to my conduct in moral life, that might prejudice him again&s;t me; but his in&s;tructions were, to let none preach in the i&s;land, unle&s;s he had a written licence to preach &s;omewhere in Ame|rica or the We&s;t-Indies: at the &s;ame time he ac|knowledged it was but a matter of mere form. I informed his Excellency, that I had been regular|ly inducted to the pari&s;h of Savannah; that I was ordained prie&s;t by letters di&s;mi&s;&s;ory from my Lord of London, and under no church cen&s;ure from his Lord&s;hip; and would always read the church prayers, if the clergy would give me the u&s;e of their churches. I added farther, that a Mini&s;ter's pulpit was looked upon as his freehold, and that I knew one clergyman who had denied his own Dio|ce&s;an the u&s;e of his pulpit. But I told his Ex|cellency, I was &s;atisfied with the liberty he allow|ed me, and would not act contrary to his injunc|tion. I then begged leave to be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, becau&s;e I was to preach at eleven o'clock. His Excellen|cy
<PB N="156" REF="013298_0156_0F904EB07B157530">
&s;aid, he intended to do him&s;elf the plea&s;ure to hear me. At eleven the church-bell rung, the church bible, prayer book, and cu&s;hion were &s;ent to the town-hou&s;e. The Governor, &s;everal of the council, the Mini&s;ter of the pari&s;h, and a&s;&s;embly-men&punc; with a great number of the town's people, a&s;|&s;embled in great order. I was very &s;ick, through a cold I catched la&s;t night&punc; but I read the church prayers, (the fir&s;t le&s;&s;on was the xvth of the fir&s;t book of Samuel) and preached on tho&s;e words, 'Righteou&s;ne&s;s exalteth a nation.' Being weak and faint, and having much of the head-ach, I did not do that ju&s;tice to my &s;ubject, as I &s;ometimes am enabled to do; but the Lord &s;o helped me, that, as I found afterwards, the Governor and the other gentlemen expre&s;&s;ed their approbation, and ac|knowledged they did not expect to be &s;o well en|tertained.&mdash;Not unto me, O Lord, not unto me, but unto thy free grace be all the glory!</Q></P>
<P><Q>After &s;ermon, Dr. F&mdash;bs, and Mr. P&mdash;t, the Collector, came to me, and de&s;ired me to fa|vour them, and the gentlemen of the town with my company to dine with them. I accepted the invitation. The Governor and the Pre&s;ident and Judge Ba&s;come were there. All wondered at my &s;peaking &s;o freely and fluently without notes. The Governor a&s;ked me whether I u&s;ed minutes. I an&s;wered, No. He &s;aid it was a great gift. At table his Excellency introduced &s;omething of reli|gion, by a&s;king me the meaning of the word <HI>Hades.</HI> Several other things were &s;tarted about free-will, Adam's fall, prede&s;tination, &amp;c. to all which God enabled me to an&s;wer &s;o pertinently, and taught me to mix the <HI>utile</HI> and <HI>dulce</HI> &s;o together, that all at table &s;eemed highly plea&s;ed, &s;hook me by the hand, and invited me to their re&s;pective hou&s;es. The Governor, in particular, a&s;ked me to dine with him on the morrow, and Dr. F&mdash;b, one
<PB N="157" REF="013298_0157_0F904EB12635CCA0">
of his particular intimates, invited me to drink tea in the afternoon. I thanked all, returned proper re&s;pects, and went to my lodgings with &s;ome de|gree of thankfulne&s;s for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance vouch&s;afed me, and aba&s;ed before God at the con&s;ideration of my un&s;peakable unworthine&s;s. In the after|noon, about five o'clock, I expounded the parable of the Prodigal Son, to many people at a private hou&s;e, and in the evening had liberty to &s;peak freely and clo&s;ely to tho&s;e that &s;upped with me.&mdash; O that this may be the beginning of good go&s;pel times to the inhabitants of this town! Lord, teach me to deal prudently with them, and cau&s;e them to melt under thy word!</Q></P>
<P><Q>Friday, April 8. Preached ye&s;terday with great clearne&s;s and freedom, to about four&s;core people at a hou&s;e on David's i&s;land, over again&s;t St. George's town; went and lay at Mr. Holiday's, who came in a boat to fetch me; and this day I heard him preach and read prayers, after which I took the &s;acrament from him. Hone&s;t man, he would have had me admini&s;ter and officiate; but I cho&s;e not to do it, le&s;t I &s;hould bring him into trouble after my departure. However, in the afternoon, I preach|ed at one Mr. Tod's, in the &s;ame pari&s;h, to a very large company indeed. The Lord was with me. My heart was warm, and what went from the heart, I tru&s;t went to the heart, for many were affected. &mdash;O that they may be converted al&s;o! Then will it be a <HI>good</HI> Friday indeed to their &s;ouls.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Sunday, April 10. Dined and conver&s;ed ye&s;ter|day very agreeably with Judge Ba&s;come; who &s;eems to have the greate&s;t in&s;ight into the differ|ence between the Arminian and Calvini&s;tical &s;cheme of any one I have yet met with upon the i&s;land. In the afternoon, I vi&s;ited a &s;ick paralytic, and this day I preached twice again at Mr. Paul's meeting-hou&s;e. The congregations were rather
<PB N="158" REF="013298_0158_0F904EB1E98C0C20">
larger than ever, and the power of God &s;eemed to be more among&s;t them. I think I &s;ee a vi&s;ible alte|ration for the better every Lord's day. Ble&s;&s;ed be God! In the evening I expounded at Mr. Jo|&s;eph Dorrell's, (where I dined) to a very large com|pany; then went to his kin&s;man's, my u&s;ual lod|ging on Saturday and Sunday evenings, who with his wife and other friends, &s;eemed kinder and kinder daily.&mdash;Good mea&s;ure, pre&s;&s;ed down and running over, may the Lord, both as to &s;pirituals and temporals, return into all their bo&s;oms!</Q></P>
<P><Q>Saturday, April 16. Preached &s;ince Lord's day at five different hou&s;es, to concerned and affected congregations, at different parts of the i&s;land, but was more indi&s;po&s;ed one night after going to bed, than I had been for &s;ome time. On two of the days of this week, I dined with the Pre&s;ident and Captain Spafford, one of the council, both which entertained me with the utmo&s;t civility.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Sunday 17. Still God magnifies his power and goodne&s;s more and more. This morning we had a plea&s;ing &s;ight at Mr. Paul's meeting-hou&s;e. I began to preach, and the people to hear and be af|fected as in days of old at home. Indeed the pro|&s;pect is encouraging. Prai&s;e the Lord, O my &s;oul! After preaching twice to large congrega|tions in the meeting-hou&s;e, I at the de&s;ire of the parents, preached in the evening a &s;ermon at the funeral of a little boy about five years of age. A great number of people attended, and the Lord enabled me &s;o to &s;peak as to affect many of the hearers. Ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord for this day's work! &mdash;Not unto me, O Lord, not unto me, but unto thy free grace be all the glory!</Q></P>
<P><Q>Sunday, April 24. The la&s;t week being rainy, I preached only five times in private hou&s;es, and this day but once in the meeting-hou&s;e; but I hope neither time without effect. This evening
<PB N="159" REF="013298_0159_0F904EB2A6490A68">
expounded at Coun&s;ellor Riddle's, who with the other gentlemen, treats me with greater re&s;pect every day. Colonel Gilbert, one of the council, has lent me his hor&s;e during my &s;tay, and Mr. D&mdash;ll this morning informed me of a de&s;ign the gentlemen had, to rai&s;e a contribution to help me to di&s;charge my arrears, and &s;upport my orphan family.&mdash;Thanks be given to thy name, O God! Thou knowe&s;t all things; thou knowe&s;t that I want to owe no man any thing, but love and pro|vide for Bethe&s;da after my decea&s;e. Thou ha&s;t promi&s;ed thou wilt fulfil the de&s;ires of them that fear thee. I believe, Lord, help my unbelief, that thou wilt fulfil this de&s;ire of my &s;oul. Even &s;o, Amen!</Q></P>
<P><Q>Saturday, April 30. Preached &s;ince Lord's day, two funeral &s;ermons, and at five different hou&s;es in different parts of the i&s;land to &s;till larger and larger auditories, and perceived the people to be affected more and more. Twice or thrice I preached without doors. Riding in the &s;un, and preaching very earne&s;tly, a little fatigued me; &s;o that this evening I was obliged to lie down for &s;ome time.&mdash; <HI>Faint, yet pur&s;uing</HI>; mu&s;t be my motto &s;till.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Sunday, May 1. This morning was a little &s;ick; but I tru&s;t God gave us a happy beginning of the new month. I preached twice with power, e&s;pe|cially in the morning, to a very great congrega|tion in the meeting-hou&s;e; and in the evening, having given previous notice, I preached about four miles di&s;tant, in the fields, to a large compa|ny of negroes, and a number of white people who came to hear what I had to &s;ay to them. I be|lieve, in all, there were near fifteen hundred peo|ple. As the &s;ermon was intended for the negroes, I gave the auditory warning, that my di&s;cour&s;e would be chiefly directed to them, and that I &s;hould endeavour to imitate the example of Elijah,
<PB N="160" REF="013298_0160_0F904EB3659BD2A8">
who when he was about to rai&s;e the child, con|tracted him&s;elf to its length. The negroes &s;eemed very &s;en&s;ible and attentive. When I a&s;ked them, whether all of them did not de&s;ire to go to heaven, one of them with a very audible voice &s;aid, 'Yes, Sir.' This cau&s;ed a little &s;miling; but in general, every thing was carried on with great decency; and I believe the Lord enabled me &s;o to di&s;cour&s;e, as to touch the negroes, and yet not to give them the lea&s;t umbrage to &s;light or behave imperiou&s;ly to their ma&s;ters. If ever a Mini&s;ter in preaching, need the wi&s;dom of the &s;erpent to be joined with the harmle&s;&s;ne&s;s of the dove, it mu&s;t be when di&s;|cour&s;ing to negroes.&mdash;Vouch&s;afe me this favour, O God, for thy dear Son's &s;ake!</Q></P>
<P><Q>Monday, May 2. Upon enquiry, I found that &s;ome of the negroes did not like my preaching, becau&s;e I told them of their cur&s;ing, &s;wearing, thieving, and lying. One or two of the wor&s;t of them, as I was informed, went away. Some &s;aid, they would not go any more: They liked Mr. M&mdash;r better, for he never told them of the&s;e things; and I &s;aid, their hearts were as black as their faces. They expected, they &s;aid, to hear me &s;peak again&s;t their ma&s;ters. Ble&s;&s;ed be God, that I was directed not to &s;ay any thing, this fir&s;t time, to the ma&s;ters at all, though my text led me to it. It might have been of bad con&s;equence, to tell them their duty, or charge them too roundly with the neglect of it, before their &s;laves. They would mind all I &s;aid to their ma&s;ters, and, per|haps nothing that I &s;aid to them. Every thing is beautiful in its &s;ea&s;on. Lord, teach me always that due &s;ea&s;on, wherever I am called, to give ei|ther black or white, a portion of thy word! How|ever, others of the poor creatures, I hear, were very thankful, and came home to their ma&s;ter's hou&s;es, &s;aying, that they would &s;trive to &s;in no
<PB N="161" REF="013298_0161_0F904EB42AFBF3B8">
more. Poor hearts! The&s;e different accounts af|fected me; and upon the whole, I could not help rejoicing, to find that their con&s;ciences were &s;o far awake.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Saturday, May 7. In my conver&s;ation the&s;e two days, with &s;ome of my friends, I was diverted much, in hearing &s;everal things that pa&s;&s;ed among the poor negroes, &s;ince my preaching to them la&s;t Sunday. One of the women, it &s;eems, &s;aid, 'That if the book I preached out of was the be&s;t book that was ever bought at, and came out of London, &s;he was &s;ure it had never all that in it, which I &s;poke to the negroes.' The old man, who &s;poke out loud la&s;t Sunday, and &s;aid 'Yes,' when I a&s;ked them, Whether all the negroes would not go to heaven? Being que&s;tioned by &s;omebody, Why he &s;poke out &s;o? An&s;wered, 'That the gentleman put the que&s;tion once or twice to them, and the other fools had not the manners to make me any an&s;wer, till, at la&s;t, I &s;eemed to point at him, and he was a&s;hamed that no body &s;hould an|&s;wer me, and therefore he did.' Another, won|dering why I &s;aid, 'Negroes had black hearts;' was an&s;wered by his black brother thus: 'Ah, thou fool, do&s;t thou not under&s;tand it? He means black with &s;in.' Two more girls were overheard by their mi&s;tre&s;s, talking about religion, and they &s;aid, 'They knew, if they did not repent, they mu&s;t be damned.' From all which I infer, that the&s;e Bermudas negroes are more knowing than I &s;uppo&s;ed; that their con&s;ciences are awake, and con&s;equently prepared, in a good mea&s;ure, for hearing the Go&s;pel preached unto them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Sunday, May 8. This al&s;o, I tru&s;t, has been a good Sabbath. In the morning I was helped to preach powerfully to a melting, and rather a larger congregation than ever, in Mr. Paul's meeting-hou&s;e; and in the evening, to almo&s;t as large a
<PB N="162" REF="013298_0162_0F904EB4F76A5338">
congregation of black and white as la&s;t Sunday, in the fields, near my hearty friend Mr. Holiday's hou&s;e. To &s;ee &s;o many black faces was affecting. They heard very attentively, and &s;ome of them now began to weep.&mdash;May God grant them a godly &s;orrow, that worketh repentance not to be repented of!</Q></P>
<P><Q>Friday, May 13. This afternoon preached over the corp&s;e of Mr. Paul's elde&s;t &s;on, about twenty-four years of age; and by all I could hear and judge of by conver&s;ing with him, he did, indeed, die in the Lord. I vi&s;ited him twice la&s;t Lord's day, and was quite &s;atisfied with what he &s;aid, though he had not much of the &s;en&s;ible pre&s;ence of God. I find he was a preacher upon his death-bed. For he exhorted all his companions to love Chri&s;t in &s;incerity, and ble&s;&s;ed his brother and &s;i&s;ter, and, I think, his father and mother, ju&s;t before his depar|ture. A great many people attended the funeral. I preached on Luke vii. 13. 'And when the Lord &s;aw her, he had compa&s;&s;ion on her, and &s;aid unto her, weep not.' Many were affected in the application of my di&s;cour&s;e, and, I tru&s;t, &s;ome will be induced, by this young man's good example, to remember their Redeemer in the days of their youth.&mdash;Grant it, O Lord, for thy dear Son's &s;ake!</Q></P>
<P><Q>Sunday, May 15. Prai&s;e the Lord, O my &s;oul, and all that is within thee prai&s;e his holy name! This morning I preached my farewel &s;ermon at Mr. Paul's meeting-hou&s;e, it was quite full, and, as the Pre&s;ident &s;aid, above a hundred and fifty whites, be&s;ides blacks, were round the hou&s;e. At|tention &s;at on every face; and when I came to take my leave, oh, what a &s;weet unaffected weep|ing was there to be &s;een every where. I believe there were few dry eyes. The negroes likewi&s;e without doors, I heard wept plentifully. My own
<PB N="163" REF="013298_0163_0F904EB5E4E23320">
heart was affected, and though I have parted from friends &s;o often, yet I find every fre&s;h parting al|mo&s;t unman's me, and very much affects my heart. Surely, a great work is begun in &s;ome &s;ouls at Bermudas.&mdash;Carry it on, O Lord! and if it be thy will, &s;end me to this dear people again. Even &s;o, Lord Je&s;us. Amen!</Q></P>
<P><Q>After &s;ermon, I dined with three of the Council and other gentlemen and ladies, at Captain Ba&s;|come's; and from thence we went to a funeral, at which Mr. M&mdash;r preached; and after that I expounded on our Lord's Transfiguration, at the hou&s;e of one Mrs. Harvey, &s;i&s;ter to dear Mr. Smith of Charle&s;town. The hou&s;e was exceeding full, and it was &s;uppo&s;ed above three hundred &s;tood in the yard. The Lord enabled me to lift my voice like a trumpet. Many wept. Mr. M&mdash;r returned from the funeral with me, and attended the lecture, as did the three Coun&s;ellors, with whom I conver&s;ed very freely.&mdash;May God reward them, and all the dear people of the i&s;land, for tho&s;e many and great favours they have con|ferred on me, who am the chief of &s;inners, and le&s;s than the lea&s;t of all &s;aints!</Q></P>

I preached only three times, but to almo&s;t three times larger audi|tories than u&s;ual. Indeed the fields are white, ready unto harve&s;t. God has been plea&s;ed to ble&s;s private vi&s;its. Go where I will, upon the lea&s;t notice, hou&s;es are crowded, and the poor &s;ouls that follow are &s;oon drenched in tears. This day I took, as it were, another farewel. As the &s;hip did not &s;ail, I preached at Somer&s;et in the morning, to a
<PB N="164" REF="013298_0164_0F904EB7363768E8">
large congregation in the fields, and expounded in the evening to a large one at Mr. Harvey's hou&s;e, round which &s;tood many hundreds of people. But in the morning and evening how did the poor &s;ouls weep. The Lord &s;eemed to be with me in a peculiar manner, and though I was ready to die with heat and &s;training, yet I was enabled to &s;peak louder, and with greater power, I think, than I have been before. Gifts and grace, e&s;pecially in the evening, were both in exerci&s;e. After the &s;ervice, when I lay down on the bed to re&s;t, many came weeping bitterly around me, and took their la&s;t farewel. Though my body was very weak, yet my &s;oul was full of comfort. It magnified the Lord, and my &s;pirit rejoiced in God my Sa|viour. Abundance of prayers and ble&s;&s;ings were put up for my &s;afe pa&s;&s;age to England, and &s;pee|dy return to Bermudas again. May they enter into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth! For God willing, I intend vi&s;iting this dear people once more. In the mean while, with all humility and thankfulne&s;s of heart will I here, O Lord, &s;et up my Ebenezer. For hitherto &s;urely thou ha&s;t help|ed me! I cannot help thinking that I was led to this i&s;land by a peculiar Providence. My dear friend, Mr. Smith of Charle&s;town, has been made e&s;pecially in&s;trumental thereto. Thanks be to the Lord for &s;ending me hither. I have been receiv|ed in a manner I dared not expect, and have met with little, very little oppo&s;ition indeed. The in|habitants &s;eem to be plain and open hearted. They have al&s;o been open handed. For they have load|ed me with provi&s;ions for my &s;ea-&s;tore; and in the &s;everal pari&s;hes, by a private voluntary contribu|tion, have rai&s;ed me upwards of a hundred pounds &s;terling. This will pay a little of Bethe&s;da's debt, and enable me to make &s;uch remittance to my dear yoke-fellow, as may keep her from being em|barra&s;&s;ed,
<PB N="165" REF="013298_0165_0F904EB7E539FFB0">
or too much beholden in my ab&s;ence. Ble&s;&s;ed be God for bringing me out of my em|barra&s;&s;ments by degrees! May the Lord reward all my benefactors a thou&s;and fold! I hear that what was given, was given exceeding heartily, and people only lamented that they could do no more.</Q></P>
<P>After having tran&s;mitted to Georgia, what was given to him for the Orphan-hou&s;e, and dreading to go back to America in that &s;ea&s;on of heat, for fear of relap&s;ing, and having pre&s;&s;ing calls to England, he took the opportunity of a brig, and in twenty-eight days arrived at Deal. During this voyage, among other letters, he wrote the following:</P>
<P><Q>June 24, 1748. (on board.) Ye&s;terday I made an end of revi&s;ing all my journals. Alas! alas! in how many things have I judged and ac|ted wrong. I have been too ra&s;h and ha&s;ty in giv|ing characters both of places and per&s;ons. Being fond of Scripture language, I have often u&s;ed a &s;tile too apo&s;tolical, and at the &s;ame time, I have been too bitter in my zeal. Wild fire has been mixt with it, and I find that I frequently wrote and &s;poke in my own &s;pirit, when I thought I was writing and &s;peaking by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Spi|rit of God. I have likewi&s;e too much made in|ward impre&s;&s;ions my rule of acting, and too &s;oon and too explicitly publi&s;hed what had been better kept in longer, or told after my death. By the&s;e things, I have hurt the ble&s;&s;ed cau&s;e I would de|fend, and al&s;o &s;tirred up needle&s;s oppo&s;ition. This has humbled me much, and made me think of a &s;aying of Mr. Henry's, 'Jo&s;eph had more hone&s;ty than he had policy, or he never would have told his dreams.' At the &s;ame time, I cannot but prai&s;e GOD, who filled me with &s;o much of his holy fire, and carried me, a poor weak youth, through &s;uch a torrent both of popularity and con|tempt,
<PB N="166" REF="013298_0166_0F904EB9F0010C18">
and &s;et &s;o many &s;eals to my unworthy mini&s;trations. I ble&s;s him for ripening my judg|ment a little more, for giving me to &s;ee and con|fe&s;s, and I hope, in &s;ome degree, to correct and amend &s;ome of my mi&s;takes.</Q></P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XIV.</HI> From his Arrival in <HI>LONDON 1748,</HI> to his going to <HI>IRELAND</HI> in the Year <HI>1751.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ON Mr. Whitefield's vi&s;iting a few of his friends, immediately after his return, he found him&s;elf in no very agreeable &s;ituation. His congregation at the Tabernacle was &s;adly &s;cattered. And as to his outward circum&s;tances,he had &s;old all his hou&s;hold fur|niture, to help to pay the Orphan-hou&s;e debt, which yet was far from being cancelled. But under all the&s;e di&s;couragements, he was &s;till &s;upported. His congregation was &s;oon re-united, and received him with the greate&s;t joy. And at this time a very un|expected thing happened to him. Lady Huntingdon, before his arrival, had ordered Mr. Howel Harris to bring him to her hou&s;e at Chel&s;ea, as &s;oon as he came a&s;hore. He went, and having preached twice, the Counte&s;s wrote to him, that &s;everal of the Nobility de&s;ired to hear him. In a few days the Earl of Che&s;terfield, and a whole circle of them attended, and having heard once, de&s;ired they might hear him again.
<Q>I therefore preached again (&s;ays he) in the evening, and went home, never more &s;urpriz|ed at any incident in my life <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. S. and Letter DCLXXIII.</NOTE>. All behaved quite well, and were in &s;ome degree affected, the Earl of Che&s;terfield thanked me, and &s;aid, 'Sir, I will not tell you what I &s;hall tell others how I approv|ed of you;' or words to this purpo&s;e. At la&s;t, Lord Bolingbroke came to hear, &s;at like an Arch|bi&s;hop, and was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, 'I had done great
<PB N="168" REF="013298_0168_0F904EBC833E4E98">
ju&s;tice to the divine attributes in my di&s;cour&s;e <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is al&s;o &s;aid, that David Hume, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of Edin|burgh, was a hearer of Mr. Whitefield's and was much taken with his eloquence. Such Te&s;timonies are &s;et down, not for their weight, but their &s;ingularity.</NOTE>. Soon afterwards her Lady&s;hip removed to town, where I preached generally twice a week to very brilliant auditories. Ble&s;&s;ed be God, not without effectual &s;ucce&s;s on &s;ome.</Q></P>
<P>In September 1748, he made a third vi&s;it to Scot|land, where he met with a hearty welcome. Great multitudes flocked to hear him both at Edinburgh and Gla&s;gow.
<Q>I have rea&s;on (&s;ays he, Letter DCC) to believe &s;ome have been awakened, and many quickened and comforted. My old friends are more &s;olidly &s;o than ever, and a foundation, I tru&s;t has been laid for doing much good, if ever the Lord &s;hould call thither again. Two Synods, and one Pre&s;bytery, brought me upon the carpet; but all has worked for good.</Q></P>
<P>He means the Synods of Gla&s;gow and Perth, and the Pre&s;bytery of Edinburgh. What happened in the Synod of Gla&s;gow may be &s;een in a Pamphlet, entitled,
<Q>A fair and impartial Account of the Debate in the Synod of Gla&s;gow and Air, 6 October, 1748, anent employing Mr. Whitefield:</Q>
publi&s;hed at Edinburgh the &s;ame year, and &s;uppo&s;ed to be written by the Rev. Dr. Er&s;kine, who was then Mini&s;ter at Kirkintilloch. The &s;hort hi&s;tory of the matter is this. A motion was made, tending to prohibit or di&s;|courage Mini&s;ters from employing Mr. Whitefield. The &s;peeches made in &s;upport of the motion, were upon the following topics. His being a prie&s;t of the church of England. That he had not &s;ubcribed the Formula. His imprudencies. Chimerical &s;cheme of the Orphan-hou&s;e. Want of Evidence, that the money he collects is rightly applied. A&s;&s;erting that
<PB N="169" REF="013298_0169_0F904EBD6228CBF8">
a&s;&s;urance is e&s;&s;ential to faith. Encouraging a depen|dance on impul&s;es and immediate revelations. De|claring on &s;lender evidence, &s;ome people converted, and others carnal and unregenerated. Often, indeed, pretending to repent of his blunders, and retract; but as often relap&s;ing into them. And la&s;tly, his being under a &s;entence of &s;u&s;pen&s;ion by Commi&s;&s;ary Garden, from which he had appealed to the High Court of Chancery, and made oath to pro&s;ecute that appeal in a twelve month; and yet it was never pro&s;ecut|ed.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the Mini&s;ters who were again&s;t the motion, &s;poke in this manner. I blu&s;h to think, &s;aid one, that any of our brethren &s;hould befriend a propo&s;al, &s;o contrary to that moderation and catholic &s;pirit, which now is, and I hope ever &s;hall be the glory of our church. I am &s;en&s;ible, many things in the Church of England need reformation; but I ho|nour her, notwith&s;tanding, as our &s;i&s;ter church. If Bi&s;hop Butler, Bi&s;hop Sherlock, or Bi&s;hop Secker were in Scotland, I &s;hould welcome them to my pul|pit. In this I &s;hould imitate Mr. Samuel Rutherford, as firm a Pre&s;byterian as any of us, who yet employed Bi&s;hop U&s;her. There is no law of Chri&s;t, no Act of A&s;&s;embly prohibiting me to give my pulpit to an Epi&s;copal, Independent, or Anabapti&s;t Mini&s;ters, if of found principles in the fundamentals of Religion, and of a &s;ober life. Our Church expre&s;sly enjoins, Act XIII. April 1711, that great tenderne&s;s is to be u&s;ed to foreign Prote&s;tants. The requiring &s;trangers to &s;ub&s;cribe our Formula, before they preach with us, would lay as effectual a bar again&s;t employing tho&s;e of congregational principles, or Pre&s;byterian Non-&s;ub&s;cribers, as tho&s;e of the Church of England.</P>
<P>As to Mr. Whitefield, &s;aid another, there are few Mini&s;ters who&s;e character has been &s;o well atte&s;ted, by the mo&s;t competent judges, both at home and abroad. One thing I cannot but ob&s;erve: tho&s;e who
<PB N="170" REF="013298_0170_0F904EBDE6702A08">
have &s;poken mo&s;t warmly again&s;t Mr. Whitefield in this debate, acknowledge they have made little or no enquiry into his character: whereas tho&s;e on the other &s;ide, have made a very careful enquiry; and that enquiry has turned out entirely to their &s;atisfac|tion. With regard to his imprudencies, there is a great difference betwixt blunders owing to a bad heart, and tho&s;e that are owing only to a mi&s;informed judg|ment; e&s;pecially, when the mi&s;takes that occa&s;ioned them, have mi&s;led &s;everal great and good men. Whether Mr. Whitefield's &s;cheme of the Orphan-hou&s;e be prudent or not, it is demon&s;trable it was ho|ne&s;tly meant. The Magi&s;trates of Savannah publi&s;h|ed three years ago, in the Philadelphia Gazette, an affidavit that they had carefully examined Mr. White|field's receipts and di&s;bur&s;ements, and found that what he had collected in behalf of the Orphans, had been hone&s;tly applied; and that be&s;ides, he had given con&s;iderably to them of his own property. As to his maintaining, that a&s;&s;urance is e&s;&s;ential to faith; encouraging an unwarrantable regard to impre&s;&s;ions; and being too ha&s;ty in pronouncing men carnal or converted; his &s;entiments in the&s;e particulars, have been altered for upwards of two years. And now he &s;carce preaches a &s;ermon, without guarding his hearers again&s;t relying on impre&s;&s;ions, and telling them that faith, and a per&s;ua&s;ion we are ju&s;tified, are very dif|ferent things, and that a holy life is the be&s;t evidence of a gracious &s;tate. The&s;e retractions are owing to a real change of &s;entiment. Letters from corre&s;pon|dents in New-England &s;hew, that this change is, at lea&s;t, of two years date, and that ever &s;ince it happen|ed he has preached and acted with remarkable cau|tion. La&s;tly, with re&s;pect to the pro&s;ecution of his appeal; Mr. Whitefield exerted him&s;elf to the utmo&s;t to get his appeal heard, but could not prevail on the Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;o much as once to meet on the affair; they, no doubt, thinking of Mr. Garden's ar|bitrary
<PB N="171" REF="013298_0171_0F904EBEB5FA4490">
proceedings with the contempt they de&s;erved.</P>
<P><Q>But &s;ay &s;ome, Mr. Whitefield being under a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion not yet rever&s;ed, is now no Mini&s;ter.</Q>
But for what was he &s;u&s;pended? Why, for no other crime, than omitting to u&s;e the form of prayer pre|&s;cribed in the communion book, when officiating in a Pre&s;byterian congregation. And &s;hall a meeting of Pre&s;byterian Mini&s;ters, pay any regard to a &s;entence which had &s;uch a foundation?</P>
<P>The i&s;&s;ue of the debate was a rejecting of the mo|tion by a vote, 27 to 13; and a re&s;olution which was &s;o expre&s;t as to be a decent burial of it; laying no new re&s;triction on Mini&s;ters from inviting &s;trangers, but leaving things preci&s;ely as they were before. And they who cho&s;e to give Mr. Whitefield their pulpits, never after met with any mole&s;tation. Upon the whole, the attacks made on Mr. Whitefield's character, prov|ed the occa&s;ion of informing the Synod of the fal&s;|hood of many a&s;per&s;ions thrown out again&s;t him, of the great increa&s;e of his prudence and caution, and the remarkable change of his &s;entiments and behavi|our, &s;o far as either were offen&s;ive. And thus what was intended for his reproach, turned out to his ho|nour.</P>
<P>While he was in Scotland, he endeavoured to do all the &s;ervice he could to the New-Jer&s;ey College, and in conjunction with &s;ome Mini&s;ters who wi&s;hed well to that in&s;titution <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See his Letter on this &s;ubject to Mr. M'Laurin Letters DCCCXXXIV. and DCCCLXVIII.</NOTE>, advi&s;ed the &s;ending over a Mini&s;ter from America to make application in per|&s;on. Which was afterwards done in the year 1754, when Mr. Tennent and Mr. Davies applied to the General A&s;&s;embly, and obtained an appointment of a general collection. He al&s;o began to think of mak|ing his Orphan-hou&s;e not only a receptacle for father|le&s;s children, but al&s;o a place of literature and aca|demical

&s;tudies. Such a place, he thought, was much wanted in the &s;outhern parts of America; and if conducted in a proper manner, would be of great &s;ervice to the colony. He therefore, after his return to England, wrote to the Tru&s;tees, &s;ignifying that this was his intention, if they would be plea&s;ed to put the colony upon another footing, and allow a li|mitted u&s;e of negroes, without which he had long been of opinion, that Georgia never could be a flou|ri&s;hing province<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letter DCCXLIV.</NOTE>. Mean time, he went on his u&s;ual way, and with his u&s;ual &s;ucce&s;s at London, Bri&s;tol, and Glouce&s;ter, during the winter. And in February 1749, made an excur&s;ion to Exeter and Plymouth, where he found a &s;trange alteration in the people, &s;ince he had been fir&s;t there, about five years before; they now received him with the greate&s;t joy, and were importunate to hear him; and many of them gave proofs of a &s;olid conver&s;ion to God <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Letter DCCXXXIII. and M. S.</NOTE>.
<Q>Now (&s;ays he) Plymouth &s;eems to be quite a new place to me.</Q>
As his health was impaired in London, he loved to range (as he calls it) after precious &s;ouls. Though he never wanted to make a &s;ect, or to &s;et him|&s;elf at the head of a party.</P>
<P><Q>I have &s;een enough of popularity, (&s;ays he) to be &s;ick of it; and did not the intere&s;t of my ble&s;&s;ed Ma&s;ter require my appearing in<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Letter DCCXLVII.</NOTE> public, the world &s;hould hear but little of me henceforward.</Q>
Yet he could not think of remitting his diligence in the work of the Go&s;pel.

He was frequently very ill; but he imagined preach|ing and travelling did him &s;ervice.

<P><Q>About this time, he wrote Remarks an a pamph|let, entitled, The Enthu&s;ia&s;m of Methodi&s;ts and Papi&s;ts compared.</Q>

<P>In March 1749, he returned to London from an excur&s;ion of about &s;ix hundred miles in the we&s;t, where he had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing that his former vi&s;its had been ble&s;&s;ed with abundant &s;ucce&s;s<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Letter DCCXLIII.</NOTE>. In May he went to Port&s;mouth, and preached every day for more than a week, to very large and attentive audi|tories. Many were brought under convictions, pre|judices &s;eemed to be univer&s;ally removed, and people, that a few days before were &s;peaking all manner of evil again&s;t him, were very de&s;irous of his longer &s;tay to preach the Go&s;pel <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Letter DCCLI.</NOTE> among them.</P>
<P>June 24. He writes from Bri&s;tol:
<Q>Ye&s;terday God brought me here, after having carried me a circuit of about eight hundred miles, and enabled me to preach, I &s;uppo&s;e, to upwards of a hundred thou&s;and &s;ouls.

<P>In the months of July and Augu&s;t he was at Lon|don, Bri&s;tol, Plymouth, Biddiford, Exeter. When he returned to London, he had the plea&s;ure of a vi&s;it from two German Mini&s;ters, who had been labouring among the Jews, and, it is &s;aid, had been made in|&s;trumental in converting many of them <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Letter DCCLXXV.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the month of September he went into North|ampton&s;hire and York&s;hire; and preached at Oundle, Abberford, Leeds, and Hawarth, where good Mr. Grim&s;haw (who was &s;o indefatigable in his endeavours to bring &s;ouls to Chri&s;t) was Mini&s;ter. In his church they had above a thou&s;and communicants, and in the church-yard about &s;ix thou&s;and hearers. At Leeds, the auditory con&s;i&s;ted of above ten thou&s;and. Thither Mr. Whitefield was invited by one of the Rev. Mr. We&s;ley's preachers, and by the &s;ocieties. And Mr. Charles We&s;ley coming there, gave notice of him to the people<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Letters DCCLXXVIII, DCCLXXIX.</NOTE>, and al&s;o introduced him to the pulpit in Newca&s;tle, where he preached four times, and twice without doors.</P>
<P>It being now late in the year, he did not go for|ward to Scotland, but returned to London, after having preached about thirty times in York&s;hire, and above ten times in Che&s;hire, and Lanca&s;hire. He was al&s;o at Sheffield and Nottingham. And the con|gregations were every where large and &s;erious. Only in one or two places, he had a little raw treatment; but this he did not mind, while he had rea&s;on to think many received real benefit <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Letters DCCLXXXI, DCCLXXXVI.</NOTE>. He arrived in London about the middle of November, and continued there till the beginning of February, employed in his u&s;ual

manner. Having offered to a&s;&s;i&s;t, occa&s;ionally, at We&s;t-&s;treet chapel, it was accepted. Accordingly, he preached four or five times there, and admini&s;ter|ed the Sacrament twice or thrice. Congregations were very large <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letter DCCCXIX.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>February 6, 1750. He writes from Glouce&s;ter <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Letter DCCCXIV.</NOTE>:
<Q>Though I left London in a very weak condition, and the weather was but bad, I came here on Fri|day evening, and was &s;trengthened to preach on Saturday, and likewi&s;e on Sunday evening, and twice the &s;ame day in the country, at the New-hou&s;e and at Hampton.</Q>
And again from Bri&s;tol, February 12.
<Q>Since I wrote la&s;t, we have been favoured both in Glouce&s;ter city, and in the coun|try, with very plea&s;ant and delightful &s;ea&s;ons <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Letter DCCCXVI.</NOTE>. I have preached about twenty times, within this eight or nine days; and though frequently expo&s;|ed to rain and hail, am much better than when I left London.</Q>
From Bri&s;tol he went to Exeter, and to Plymouth, and in his way met with the Rev. Mr. Pear&s;all, a di&s;&s;enting Mini&s;ter at Taunton, and Mr. Darracott at Wellington; both of whom he &s;peaks of in his letters with the highe&s;t regard <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Letter DCCCXX.</NOTE>. At Plymouth he preached twelve times in &s;ix days, and the longer he preached, he had the greater num|ber of hearers. His friends grew more and more zea|lous, and the fury of his enemies began to &s;ub&s;ide. From thence he travelled near to the Land's-end, preaching in a great many places, &s;uch as Tavi&s;tock.

<P>In April he was at London and Port&s;mouth. And in May went to A&s;hby, to wait on Lady Huntingdon, who had been ill. In his way thither, he had a mo&s;t comfortable interview with the Rev. Dr. Doddridge, Mr. Hervey <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>Mr. Harvey thus wrote of this interview to a friend;</P>
<P><Q>I have &s;een lately, that mo&s;t excellent Mini&s;ter of the ever-ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us, Mr. Whitefield. I dined, &s;upped, and &s;pent the evening with him at North|ampton, in company with Dr. Doddridge, and two pious, ingenious Clergymen of the Church of Eng|land, both of them known to the learned world by their valuable writings. And &s;urely, I never &s;pent a more delightful evening, or &s;aw one that &s;eemed to make nearer approaches to the felicity of heaven. A Gentleman of great worth and rank in the town, invited us to his hou&s;e, and gave us an elegant treat; but how mean was his provi&s;ion, how coar&s;e his delicacies, compared with the fruit of my friend's lips; they dropped as the honey|comb, and were a well of life. Surely, people do not know that amiable and examplary man, or el&s;e, I cannot but think, in&s;tead of depreciating, they would applaud and love him. For my part, I ne|ver beheld &s;o fair a copy of our Lord, &s;uch a liv|ing image of the Saviour, &s;uch exalted delight in God, &s;uch enlarged benevolence to man, &s;uch a &s;teady faith in the divine promi&s;es, and &s;uch a fervent zeal for the divine glory; and all this, with|out the lea&s;t moro&s;ene&s;s of humour, or extravagan|cies of behaviour; &s;weetned with the mo&s;t engag|ing chearfulne&s;s of temper, and regulated by all the &s;obriety of rea&s;on, and wi&s;dom of Scripture; in &s;o much, that I cannot forbear applying the wi&s;e man's encomium of an illu&s;trious woman, to this eminent Mini&s;ter of the everla&s;ting Go&s;pel; "Many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> have done virtuou&s;ly, but thou excelle&s;t them all.</Q></P></NOTE>, and Dr. &mdash;.</P>

<P>After he left A&s;hby, he preached at Radcliff church, Nottingham and Sutten with great &s;ucce&s;s.
<Q>At Nottingham, (&s;ays he) &s;everal came to me, enquir|ing, What they &s;hould do to be &s;aved? I preached there four times. One evening, Lord S&mdash;, and &s;everal Gentlemen, were pre&s;ent, and behaved with great decency. Many thou&s;ands attended. Ye&s;terday morning I breakfa&s;ted with three di&s;&s;ent|ing Mini&s;ters; and Mr. P&mdash;s, who told me, that Lady P&mdash; de&s;ired he would pre&s;s me to preach at the church. Ye&s;terday, in the afternoon, I preached at Sutton; and this morning <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Letter DCCCXXXVIII.</NOTE> at Mans|field.</Q>
After leaving that place, he went to Ruther|ham and Sheffield. He was at Leeds in the end of

May, and ob&s;erves,
<Q>Methinks, I am now got into another climate <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letters DCCCXL, and XLIX.</NOTE>, where there are many of God's people.</Q>
From thence he went to Manche&s;ter, Ro|&s;indale, and &s;everal other parts of Lanca&s;hire, Kendal, Whitehaven, Cockermouth, preaching generally twice a day, and arrived at Edinburgh, July 6. Having preach|ed near a hundred times &s;ince he left London, and by a moderate computation, to above a hundred thou|&s;and &s;ouls.
<Q>It is amazing (he writes) to &s;ee how people are prepared, in places where I never was before. What &s;hall I render to the Lord?</Q></P>
<P>At Edinburgh and Gla&s;gow, (in which places he &s;pent the month of July, 1750) he was received, as u&s;ual, in the mo&s;t loving and tender manner, preaching generally twice a day to great multitudes, who&s;e &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, and earne&s;t de&s;ire to hear him, made him exert him&s;elf rather beyond his &s;trength.
<Q>By preaching always twice, (&s;ays he) and once thrice, and once four times in a day <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Letters DCCCLI, and LV.</NOTE>, I am quite weakened; but I hope to recruit again. I am burning with a fever, and have a violent cold; but Chri&s;t's pre&s;ence makes me &s;mile at pain, and the fire of his love burns up all fevers what&s;oever.</Q>
He left Edinburgh Augu&s;t 3, and &s;oon found him&s;elf much better for riding. At Berwick, one of the mini&s;ters &s;ent him an offer of his pulpit, and he was informed that many more round that town, were willing to do the &s;ame. At his return to London, he preached &s;everal times at We&s;t-&s;treet Chapel. He had al&s;o the plea&s;ure of Mr. Her|vey's company, who, at his de&s;ire, came up to town, and lodged in his hou&s;e. In the months of Septem|ber and October, he made excur&s;ions to Port&s;mouth, Chatham, Glouce&s;ter, Birmingham, Ever&s;ham, Wed|ne&s;bury, and Nottingham;
<Q>ranging about, (as he

And was particularly &s;ucce&s;sful at Chatham and Canterbury.</P>
<P>He &s;pent the winter in London, in his u&s;ual bu&s;y and laborious way, and with equal &s;ucce&s;s. He was confined, near a fortnight, to his room by a violent fe|ver, and inflammation of the lungs; but before the 17th of December, he was able to preach again. And in the latter end of January 1751, he rode po&s;t to A&s;h|by, being alarmed with the accounts of Lady Hunt|ingdon's dangerous illne&s;s, and the afflictions with which it had plea&s;ed God to vi&s;it her family. He writes from A&s;hby, January 29.
<Q>Ble&s;&s;ed be God, Lady Huntingdon is &s;omewhat better. Entreat all our friends to pray for her. Her &s;i&s;ter-in-law, La|dy Frances H&mdash;, lies dead in the hou&s;e. She was a retired chri&s;tian, lived &s;ilently, and died &s;ud|denly, without a groan. May my exit be like hers. Almo&s;t all the family have been &s;ick in their turns.</Q></P>
<P>Having left London, March 5, He went again in|to Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, and to Bri&s;tol, and preached at Taunton and Wellington in his way to Plymouth. April 11. he was at Exeter, and writes thus to Mr. Hervey:
<Q>Some good I tru&s;t, is to be done this &s;pring, to many &s;ouls. This we&s;tern circuit, I be|lieve, has been ble&s;&s;ed already. I have preached about forty times &s;ince I left London, and have been enabled &s;everal times to ride forty miles a day. I find this &s;en&s;ibly refre&s;hes me. I wi&s;h you could &s;ay &s;o too. At Plymouth we had &s;weet &s;ea&s;ons; and on Tue&s;day la&s;t I met with a young Clergy|man, who was awakened under my preaching &s;even years ago. He had been at Cambridge, and was ordained by the Bi&s;hop of Exeter. He is followed much, and, I &s;uppo&s;e, will &s;oon

be reproached for his Ma&s;ter's &s;ake. I hope you find &s;trength to proceed in your book.</Q></P>
<P>From Exeter he &s;et out on a tour through Wales, where, in about three weeks he rode near five hun|dred miles, and preached generally twice a day; and from hence, he made his vi&s;it to Ireland, which had been in his thoughts &s;ome time.</P>

<P>AFTER a pa&s;&s;age of five days from Wales, he arrived, May 24, 1751, at Dublin, where he was gladly received, and lodged at the hou&s;e of Mr. L&mdash;, and preached every morning and evening as u&s;ual in other places:
<Q>Surely (&s;ays he) here are many converted &s;ouls, among whom are two or three &s;tudents, and &s;everal &s;oldiers. At fir&s;t <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letters DCCCXCI, DCCCXCII.</NOTE> the greatne&s;s and hurry of the place &s;urprized me; but thanks be to the Lord of the harve&s;t, here as well as el&s;ewhere, the fields are white, ready unto har|ve&s;t.

And again:
<Q>Athlone, June 10. For this week pa&s;t, I have been preaching twice almo&s;t every day in &s;ome country towns. I find, through the many offences that have lately been given, mat|ters were brought to a low ebb. But the cry now is, 'Methodi&s;m is revived again.'</Q>
<Q>I took a journey from near Haverford We&s;t to Ireland, where a yet greater work had been begun and car|ried on to a high degree, amid&s;t prodigious oppo&s;i|tion; numbers converted, not only from Popery, but to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, at Athlone, Dublin, Limerick, Cork, and various other places<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">M. S.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>At Limerick he preached &s;even times to large and affected auditories, and twice at Cork (where the Me|thodi&s;ts had lately been mobbed) to a great body of people, with all quietne&s;s. From thence he went to
<PB N="182" REF="013298_0182_0F904EC6E7351818">
Bandon and Kin&s;ale, where a like ble&s;&s;ing attended his preaching. At his return to Cork, the numbers and affections of his hearers increa&s;ed. At Belfa&s;t al|&s;o he was detained &s;ome days beyond his intention, by the peoples' importunity, and preached at Li&s;burn, Lurgun, the Maize, and Lambag, towns and places adjacent. So many attended, and the pro&s;pect of do|ing good was &s;o promi&s;ing, that he was &s;orry he had not come to the north of Ireland &s;ooner. But he ha&s;t|ed to pay another vi&s;it to Scotland, before he em|barked for America, which he was intent upon doing before winter.</P>
<P>He therefore came over in the beginning of July 1751, from Belfa&s;t to Irvine, where, at the de&s;ire of the magi&s;trates, he preached to a great congregation; and &s;o proceeded to Gla&s;gow. From this place he writes, July 12.
<Q>Though I preached near eighty times in Ireland, and God was plea&s;ed to ble&s;s his word, yet Scotland &s;eems to be a new world to me. To &s;ee the people bring &s;o many Bibles, turn to every pa&s;&s;age when I am expounding, and hang|ing, as it were, upon me to hear every word, is very encouraging. I feel an uncommon freedom here; and talking with the winter as well as with the &s;ummer &s;aints, feeds and delights my heart.</Q></P>
<P>Here it may be proper, once for all, to take notice of &s;ome particulars relating to Mr. Whitefield's vi&s;its to Scotland, which he continued till within a few years of his death.</P>
<P>Though after the years 1741, and 1742, there was no &s;uch exten&s;ive new awakenings, Mr. Whitefield's coming was always refre&s;hing to &s;erious per&s;ons, and &s;eemed to put new life into them: and al&s;o to be the means of increa&s;ing their number. His preaching was &s;till eminently u&s;eful in various re&s;pects. In the fir&s;t place, it had an excellent tendency to de&s;troy the hurtful &s;pirit of bigotry, and exce&s;&s;ive zeal for &s;maller <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. S.</NOTE>
<PB N="183" REF="013298_0183_0F904EC830D3C180">
matters; and to turn mens' attention to the great and &s;ub&s;tantial things of religion. Another effect was, that it drew &s;everal per&s;ons to hear the go&s;pel, who &s;eldom went to hear it from other Mini&s;ters. Again, young people in general were much benefited by his mini&s;try, and particularly young &s;tudents, who be|came afterwards &s;erious evangelical preachers. La&s;t|ly, his morning di&s;cour&s;es, which were mo&s;tly intend|ed for &s;incere but di&s;con&s;olate &s;ouls, were peculiarly fitted to direct and encourage all &s;uch in the chri&s;tian life. And his addre&s;&s;es in the evening to the promi&s;|cuous multitudes who then attended him, were of a very alarming kind. There was &s;omething exceed|ingly &s;triking in the &s;olemnity of his evening congre|gations in the Orphan-hou&s;e park at Edinburgh, and High-church-yard of Gla&s;gow; e&s;pecially towards the conclu&s;ion of his &s;ermons, (which were common|ly very long, though they &s;eemed &s;hort to the hearers) when the whole multitude &s;tood fix'd, and like one man hung upon his lips, with &s;ilent attention, and many under deep impre&s;&s;ions of the great objects of religion, and the concerns of eternity. The&s;e things will not &s;oon be forgotten; and it is hoped, the many good effects, which by the divine ble&s;&s;ing attended them, never will.</P>
<P>His conver&s;ation was no le&s;s reviving than his &s;er|mons. Many in Edinburgh and Gla&s;gow are wit|ne&s;&s;es of this, e&s;pecially at Gla&s;gow, when in company with his good friends, Mr. MacLaurin, Mr. Robert Scott, &amp;c. one might challenge the &s;ons of plea&s;ure with all their wit, good humour and gaiety to furni&s;h entertainment &s;o agreeable. At the &s;ame time, every part of it was not more agreeable, than it was u&s;eful and edifying.</P>
<P>His friends in Scotland, among whom were many of all ranks, from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t, were very con&s;tant and &s;teady in their great regard for him. And his oppo&s;ers grew more and more mild. Some

anonymous pamphlets were written again&s;t him at his fir&s;t coming: But the&s;e &s;oon died and were forgotten. Afterwards a number of &s;tories were handed about to his di&s;advantage; but upon enquiry, it was found either that matters were mi&s;repre&s;ented or exaggerat|ed; or that there was no foundation for &s;uch reports at all. In &s;hort, when they were traced to their ori|gin, they rather turned out to his honour. He u&s;ed to &s;mile at good Mr. MacLaurin's hone&s;t zeal, who, on &s;uch occa&s;ions, &s;pared no pains to come at the truth, and when he had di&s;covered it, was no le&s;s ea|ger to communicate the di&s;covery to others, for the vindication of Mr. Whitefield's character, in which he thought the credit of religion was concerned. The following in&s;tance is well remembered. One Lieute|nant Wright alledged, that Mr. Whitefield had kept back money &s;ent by a gentlewoman to her &s;on in America. This coming to Mr. MacLaurin's ears, he was re&s;tle&s;s till he procured a meeting betwixt Mr. Whitefield and his accu&s;er. They met; Mr. Wright did not retract what he had &s;aid. Upon which a let|ter was in&s;tantly wrote to the mother at London; and her an&s;wer being received, a confutation of the calumny was publi&s;hed in the Gla&s;gow Courant, in the following terms: October 31, 1748.
<Q>A &s;tory having been &s;pread in this town of Mr. Whitefield's having received twenty pounds &s;terling from a gentlewoman in London, to give her &s;on in Geor|gia: whereas, he had received only three guineas, which he had returned to the gentlewoman when he came back from Georgia, her &s;on having been gone from thence before his arrival; a letter was wrote to London to clear up this affair, to which the gentlewoman has &s;ent this an&s;wer: 'Sir, this is to a&s;&s;ure you, that I received of Mr. John Ste|vens the three guineas, which was the full &s;um that I gave you for my &s;on. I hope it is only a fal&s;e a&s;per&s;ion on him; for I never heard that he &s;hould

&s;ay any &s;uch thing, being three months in Eng|land. I am, &amp;c. September 13, 1748.' There is likewi&s;e a receipt come down, dated September 3, to Mr. Stevens. Both the letter and receipt are to be &s;een in the hands of the publi&s;her.</Q></P>
<P>But, indeed, Mr. Whitefield's whole behaviour was &s;o open to the eyes of the world; and his character, after it had &s;tood many attacks from all quarters, came at la&s;t to be &s;o thoroughly e&s;tabli&s;hed, that &s;everal of his oppo&s;ers in Scotland &s;eemed rather to acquire a certain degree of e&s;teem for him; at lea&s;t, they all thought proper to give over &s;peaking again&s;t him.</P>
<P>When he was at Gla&s;gow, he always lodged with Mr. James Niven, Merchant, above the Cro&s;s; till towards the end of his life, his a&s;thmatic di&s;order made the town air di&s;agree with him. And then he went out in the evenings, and &s;tayed with his good friend Mr. MacCulloch at Cambu&s;lang.</P>
<P>A per&s;on of eminence, whom a &s;incere e&s;teem of Mr. Whitefield made attentive to his reception and mini&s;trations in Scotland, from fir&s;t to la&s;t; writes thus to the compiler:</P>
<P>Edinburgh, January 1772.
<Q>I think more might be &s;aid with great ju&s;tice, concerning the effects of his mini&s;try in Scotland, after the fir&s;t two years; as there was always a remarkable revival followed each of his vi&s;its; which many of the Mini&s;ters te&s;tified from their particular knowledge, e&s;pecially by the number of new communicants. Mention might be made of the great number of Mini&s;ters in Scotland, that employed him, and of the many af|fectionate letters he received from them, of which there were a good many printed both in the Lon|don and Gla&s;gow Weekly Hi&s;tories, from &s;ome of the mo&s;t eminent men in the church, who had em|ployed him to preach in their pulpits, and conti|nued &s;o to do, when opportunity offered; except in the Pre&s;bytery of Edinburgh; and even there,
<PB N="186" REF="013298_0186_0F904ECB66A4BEF8">
the Magi&s;trates always allowed him a church to preach in, every time he came.</Q></P>
<P>In the month of July, 1751, Mr. Whitefield was glad to under&s;tand that Mr. Dinwiddie, brother-in-law to the Rev. Mr. MacCulloch of Cambu&s;lang, was made Governor of Virginia. In that province there had been a con&s;iderable awakening for &s;ome years pa&s;t, e&s;pecially in Hanover county and the places adjacent. As the Mini&s;ters of the e&s;tabli&s;hment did not favour the work, and the people had put them&s;elves under the care of the New York Synod, they met with di&s;|couragements from tho&s;e in power. However, Mr. Samuel Davies (afterwards Pre&s;ident of the College of New-Jer&s;ey) being licen&s;ed, was &s;ettled over a con|gregation; and the religious concern &s;o increa&s;ed, that one congregation was multiplied to &s;even. There was now an agreeable pro&s;pect that the&s;e good peo|ple would have the &s;ame privileges &s;ecured to them, which di&s;&s;enting Prote&s;tants enjoy at home <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letter DCCCCI.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Augu&s;t 6, he &s;et out from Edinburgh for London, in order to embark a fourth time for America. He had thrown up much blood in Edinburgh; but the journey he was now upon had a good effect in reco|vering him from that illne&s;s: and as he went along, he was much refre&s;hed with the accounts he received of the happy fruits of his mini&s;try at Kendal the year before. After a &s;orrowful parting with his friends in England, which grew &s;till more di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to him, he went aboard the Antelope, Captain MacLellan, bound for Georgia with Germans; and took along with him &s;everal children.</P>
<P>He arrived at Savannah, October 27, and found the Orphan-hou&s;e in a flouri&s;hing condition.
<Q>Thanks be to God, (&s;ays he) all is well at Bethe&s;da. A mo&s;t excellent tract of land is granted to me very near the hou&s;e, which in a few years, I hope, will make a &s;ufficient provi&s;ion for it <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Letter DCCCCXII.</NOTE>.</Q>
From November 1751,

to the beginning of April 1752, he was partly at Be|the&s;da, and partly in South Carolina, &s;till upon the &s;tretch in his Ma&s;ter's work.

<P>Being warned by what had happened to him for|merly, he did not venture to &s;tay the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on in America; but took his pa&s;&s;age in the end of April for London. At his arrival, he perceived he had re|turned in a very good time; for Georgia was &s;oon to be taken into the hands of Government, and put on the &s;ame footing with other colonies, which gave ground to hope that it would &s;oon became a flouri&s;hing province. This was joyful news. He now thought pro|vidence was appearing for Georgia and Bethe&s;da. He determined therefore to &s;ell his plantation, and to car|ry all his &s;trength to the Orphan-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>About the middle of June, he planned a new rout.
<Q>Next week, (&s;ays he) God willing, I &s;hall go to Port&s;mouth, from thence to Bath, then to the we&s;t, then to Wales, and from thence, may be, to <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Letters DCCCCXVII.</NOTE> Scot|land and Ireland.</Q>
Accordingly we find his letters of this period, dated at Port&s;mouth, Bri&s;tol, Cardiff, Ha|verford-we&s;t. In returning to Bri&s;tol, he attended an a&s;&s;ociation, where were pre&s;ent about nine clergy, and near forty other labourers, of whom he writes <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Letter DCCCCXXV.</NOTE>:

In his way he preached twice at Lutterworth (the famous John Wickliff's pari&s;h) and at Leice&s;ter; and in both places was informed afterwards that good was done.

<P>MR. Whitefield having preached in London at his Tabernacle for a few days with his u&s;ual fervour, and &s;ucce&s;s, and to large congregations, in the end of the month of June, &s;et out towards Scot|land. In his way he had de&s;irable meetings at Oul|ney and Northampton. He preached al&s;o at Lei|ce&s;ter, and Nottingham, where a great multitude came to hear, and at Sheffield. In his way to Leeds, next morning, he preached at Rotheram and Wake|field. At the former place he had been di&s;turbed twice or thrice, and was almo&s;t determined to preach there no more. But he <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letter DCCCCLXXXIV.</NOTE> found this would have been a ra&s;h determination; for &s;ome who had been bitter per&s;ecutors, now received him gladly into their hou&s;e, and owned, that God had made him in&s;tru|mental in their conver&s;ion. At Leeds he had great &s;ucce&s;s. At York al&s;o he preached four times. Twice they were di&s;turbed, and twice had very agreeable &s;ea&s;ons. At Newca&s;tle he preached &s;even times, and once at Sunderland to great multitudes who were deeply impre&s;&s;ed. At five in the morning the great room was filled, and on the Lords-day, the congrega|tion without was exceeding large. In &s;hort, the pro&s;|pect all around was &s;o promi&s;ing, that he almo&s;t re|pented of his engagement to go to Scotland, and re|&s;olved to come back as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="013298_0193_0F904ED3C594ECB0">He proceeded however, according to his promi&s;e, and having &s;pent &s;ome days at Edinburgh and Gla&s;|gow in his u&s;ual laborious and earne&s;t manner, and with u&s;ual acceptance, he returned to England, Au|gu&s;t 7.</P>
<P>All this time he preached twice or thrice a day, and once five times. This he found rather too much for his &s;trength. But he &s;till went on, often expre&s;|&s;ing his de&s;ires and hopes &s;oon to &s;ee his Divine Ma&s;|ter in glory.</P>
<P>After he had been in Gla&s;gow, the following para|graph appeared in the Newca&s;tle Journal, Augu&s;t 11, 1753.
<Q>By a Letter from Edinburgh we are informed, that on the &s;econd in&s;tant Mr. Whitefield, the Iti|nerant, being at Gla&s;gow, and preaching to a nu|merous audience near the Play-hou&s;e lately built, he inflamed the mob &s;o much again&s;t it, that they ran directly from before him, and pulled it down to the ground. Several of the rioters are &s;ince taken up, and committed to goal.</Q></P>
<P>It would not have been worth while to tran&s;cribe this, were it not another &s;pecimen of the unaccount|able liberties taken by &s;ome of the oppo&s;ers of Mr. Whitefield, in telling their &s;tories concerning him. The fact was this. Mr. Whitefield being informed, that the Players had lately come to Gla&s;gow, and had met with &s;ome encouragement, took occa&s;ion in his &s;ermons to preach again&s;t Play-hou&s;es, and to repre|&s;ent their pernicious influence on religion and mora|lity, e&s;pecially in a populous, commercial city, and the &s;eat of a Univer&s;ity. But there was no riot. It was the proprietor of the Play-hou&s;e (at that time a &s;light temporary booth &s;upported by the old walls of the Bi&s;hop's Ca&s;tle) who ordered his workmen to take it down.</P>
<P>On his return to England, he went from Newca&s;tle to Stockton, O&s;motherly, York and Leeds. He a&s;&s;i&s;t|ed at the &s;acrament at Howard, where they had a
<PB N="194" REF="013298_0194_0F904ED4703E6EF0">
extraordinary &s;ea&s;on, and a va&s;t many communicants. He went as far as Bolton, Manche&s;ter and Stockport. The more he preached, the more eager the people &s;eemed to be. The la&s;t part of his circuit was to Lin|coln&s;hire, Rotheram, Sheffield Nottingham and Nor|thampton. He returned to London in the latter end of September, having travelled about twelve hundred miles, and preached a hundred and eighty times to many thou&s;ands <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letter DCCCCXCII.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>His &s;tay in London was but &s;hort, in the month of October he took another tour to Stafford&s;hire. A new &s;cene of u&s;efulne&s;s &s;eemed to open to him, while he he preached at Oulney, at Oxen near Harborough, Bo&s;worth, Kettering and Bedford; at all which places preached in one week. At Birmingham al&s;o, and &s;everal adjacent places, the people flocked to hear the go&s;pel. At a place near Dudley called Guarnall he was informed of a whole company that were awaken|ed by reading his &s;ermons <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Letter DCCCCXCVI.</NOTE>. He met with others a|wakened years ago, and heard of a notorious per&s;e|cutor and drunkard who had been powerfully &s;truck. He loved to break up new ground, as he expre&s;&s;es it; and had the plea&s;ure to find &s;ometimes that his way was prepared by the ble&s;&s;ing which God had given to his writings, particularly at Alperam in Che&s;hire, and at Liverpool, where a per&s;on that had received benefit by reading his &s;ermons, met him at landing, and took him to his hou&s;e. All was quiet here, and at Che&s;ter, where he preached four times and had &s;everal of the clergy in his congregations. But at Wrexham and Nantwich (where a Methodi&s;t meet|ing-hou&s;e had lately been pulled down) he was di|&s;turbed by the mob, and forced to remove his congre|gation to a place a little out of town <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Letter DCCCCXCVII.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Thus he went on, returning at times for a few days to London. And November 16, writes from Glou|ce&s;ter,
<PB N="195" REF="013298_0195_0F904ED56E2C9A38">

<P><Q>On Sunday, November, 25. he opened the new Tabernacle at Bri&s;tol, which he ob&s;erves was large, but not half large enough; for if the place could contain them, near as many would attend as in London.</Q>
He al&s;o preached twice, in his brother's great hou&s;e to the quality. Though it was &s;o late in the year, he &s;et out for Somer&s;et&s;hire, and preached &s;eve|ral times in the open air, at &s;even o'clock at night.

He was &s;till more &s;hocked at the proce&s;&s;ion of St. Francis; the following de&s;cription of which he wrote to his friend <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Letter MXXXVI.</NOTE>, with expre&s;&s;ions of prai&s;e and grati|tude to Providence for the great wonder of the Re|formation:
<Q>An intelligent Prote&s;tant, who &s;tood near me, was &s;o good as to be my interpreter of the dumb &s;hew as it pa&s;&s;ed along.&mdash;I &s;ay, dumb &s;hew; for you mu&s;t know, it was chiefly made up of waxen or wooden images, carried on mens' &s;houlders through the &s;treets, intending to repre|&s;ent the life and death of St. Francis, the founder of one of their religious orders. They were brought out from the Franci&s;can convent, and were preced|ed by three per&s;ons in &s;carlet habits, with ba&s;kets in their hands, in which they received the alms of the &s;pectators, for the benefit of the poor pri&s;oners. After the&s;e, came two little boys in party-coloured cloaths, with wings fixed on their &s;houlders, in imi|tation of little angels.&mdash;Then appeared the figure of St. Francis, very gay and beau-like, as he u&s;ed to be before his conver&s;ion. In the next he was in|troduced under conviction, and con&s;equently &s;tript of his finery. Soon after this, was exhibited an image of our ble&s;&s;ed LORD him&s;elf, in a purple gown, with long black hair, with St. Francis lying before him, to receive his immediate orders. Then came the Virgin Mother, (<HI>hore&s;co referens</HI>) with CHRIST her &s;on at her left hand, and St. Francis making his obei&s;ance to both.&mdash;Here, if I remem|ber aright, he made his fir&s;t appearance in his fri|ar's habit, with his hair cut &s;hort, but not as yet &s;haved in the crown of his head. After a little &s;pace followed a mitre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Cardinal gaudily attired, and be|fore him lay St. Francis almo&s;t pro&s;trate, in order to be confirmed in his office.

crown &s;horn, his habit black, and his loins girt with a knotted cord.&mdash;Here he prays to our Saviour hanging on a cro&s;s, that the marks of the wounds in his hands, feet, and &s;ide, might be impre&s;&s;ed on the &s;ame parts of his body. The prayer is granted; blood comes from the hands, feet, and &s;ide; and the &s;aint, with great devotion, re|ceives the impre&s;&s;ion. This was repre&s;ented by red waxen &s;trings, reaching from tho&s;e parts of the image to the corre&s;ponding parts of St. Francis's body. Upon this he begins to do wonders; and therefore, in a little while, he is carried along, as holding up a hou&s;e which was ju&s;t falling. This miracle, they &s;ay, was performed, (if my informa|tion be true) at Madrid, but the particulars of its hi&s;tory I have forgotten. At length the father dies, and is brought forth lying in his grave. But lo! the briars and nettles under which be lay, are turned unto fine and fragrant flowers. After this he is borne along upon a bier covered with a &s;il|ver pall, and four friars lamenting over him.&mdash;He then appears for the la&s;t time, but with an increa&s;e of power; for he was repre&s;ented as drawing tor|mented people out of purgatory with his knotted cord, which, as you may well imagine, the poor &s;ouls catched at, and took hold of very eagerly. At length came a gorgeous friar under a &s;plendid ca|nopy, bearing in his hand a piece of the holy cro&s;s. After him followed two more little winged boys, and then a long train of fat and well favoured Fran|ci&s;cans, with their <HI>calceis fene&s;tratis,</HI> as Era&s;mus calls them; and &s;o the proce&s;&s;ion ended. . . . . About ten o'clock at night, a train of near two hundred penitents pa&s;&s;ed along, and &s;everal companies fol|lowed after with their re&s;pective preaching friars at their heads, bearing crucifixes. The penitents them&s;elves were cloathed and covered all over with

white linen ve&s;tments, only holes were made for their eyes to peep out at. All were bare-footed, and all had long heavy chains fa&s;tened to their an|cles, which, when dragged along the &s;treet, made a di&s;mal rattling: but though alike in dre&s;s, yet in other re&s;pects there was great variety among&s;t them. For &s;ome carried great &s;tones on their backs, and others dead mens bones and &s;kulls in their hands. Some bore large and &s;eemingly very heavy cro&s;&s;es upon their &s;houlders, whil&s;t others had their arms extended quite wide, or carried a bow full of &s;words with the points downwards. Mo&s;t of them whipped and la&s;hed them&s;elves, &s;ome with cords, and others with flat bits of iron. It being a moon|&s;hine night, I could &s;ee them quite well; and in|deed &s;ome of them &s;truck &s;o hard, that I perceived their backs, (left bare on purpo&s;e to be &s;la&s;hed) were quite red, and &s;wollen very much by the vio|lence and repetition of the blows.

Go which way you would, nothing was to be &s;een but illuminations within, and hurry without.&mdash;For all per&s;ons, crowned heads them&s;elves not excepted, are obliged on this day to vi&s;it &s;even churches or altars, in imitation, as is &s;uppo&s;ed, of our LORD's being hurried from one tribunal to another, before he was condemned to be hung upon the cro&s;s.</Q>
The following is an ac|count of Good Friday's &s;uper&s;titious and idolatrous farce:
<Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letter MXLI.</NOTE>Before all u&s;ed to be noi&s;e and hurry;&mdash; now, all was hu&s;hed and &s;hut up in the mo&s;t awful and profound &s;ilence. No clock or bell had been heard &s;ince ye&s;terday noon. About two in the af|ternoon we got to the place, where (I had heard &s;ome days ago) an extraordinary &s;cene was to be exhibited: 'The crucifixion of the Son of GOD, repre&s;ented partly by dumb images, and partly by living per&s;ons, in a large church belonging to the convent of <HI>St. De Beate.</HI>' Several thou&s;ands crowd|ed into it.&mdash;Through the kind interpo&s;ition and a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of a Prote&s;tant or two, I was not only ad|mitted into the church, but was very commodiou&s;|ly &s;ituated to view the whole performance. We had not waited long before the curtain was drawn up. Immediately, upon a high &s;caffold, hung in the front with black baize, and behind with &s;ilk purple dama&s;k laced with gold, was exhibited to our view an image of the LORD JESUS at full length, crown|ed with thorns, and nailed on a cro&s;s between two figures of like dimen&s;ions, repre&s;enting the two thieves. At a little di&s;tance on the right hand, was placed an image of the Virgin Mary, in plain long ruffles, and a kind of widow-weeds. Her veil was purple &s;ilk, and &s;he had a wire glory round her head.&mdash;At the foot of the cro&s;s lay, in a mournful pen&s;ive po&s;ture, a living man, dre&s;&s;ed in woman's cloaths, who per&s;onated Mary Magdalen; and not
<PB N="201" REF="013298_0201_0F904DFB8E914F20">
far off &s;tood a young man, in imitation of the be|loved di&s;ciple.&mdash;He was dre&s;&s;ed in a loo&s;e green &s;ilk ve&s;ture, and bob-wig.&mdash; His eyes were fixed on the cro&s;s, and his two hands a little extended. On each &s;ide, near the front of the &s;tage, &s;tood two centinels in buff, with formidable caps and long beards; and directly in the front &s;tood another yet more formidable, with a large target in his hand. We may &s;uppo&s;e him to be the Roman centurion. To complete the &s;cene, from behind the purple hangings came out about twenty little purple ve&s;t|ed winged boys, two by two, each bearing a light|ed wax taper in his hand, and a crim&s;on and gold cap on his head.&mdash;At their entrance upon the &s;tage, they gently bowed their heads to the &s;pectators, then kneeled and made obei&s;ance, fir&s;t to the image on the cro&s;s, and then to that of the Virgin Mary. When ri&s;en, they bowed to each other, and then took their re&s;pective places over-again&s;t one ano|ther on &s;teps a&s;&s;igned for them at the front of the &s;tage. Oppo&s;ite to this, at a few yards di&s;tance, &s;tood a black friar in a pulpit hung in mourning. For a while he pau&s;ed, and then, breaking &s;ilence, gra|dually lifted up his voice 'till it was extended to a pretty high pitch, though I think &s;carce high enough for &s;o large an auditory. After he had pro|ceeded in his di&s;cour&s;e about a quarter of an hour, a confu&s;ed noi&s;e was heard near the front great door; upon turning my head, I &s;aw four long-bearded men, two of which carried a ladder on their &s;houlders, and after them followed two more with large gilt di&s;hes in their hands, full of linen, &s;pices, &amp;c. The&s;e (as I imagined) were the repre&s;entatives of Nicodemus and Jo&s;eph of Arimathea. On a &s;ig|nal given from the pulpit, they advanced towards the &s;teps of the &s;caffold. But upon their very fir&s;t attempting to mount it, at the watchful centurion's nod, the ob&s;ervant &s;oldiers made a pa&s;s at them,
<PB N="202" REF="013298_0202_0F904DFBAC2452D0">
and pre&s;ented the points of their javelins directly to their brea&s;ts. They are repul&s;ed. Upon this a letter from Pilate is produced. The centurion reads it, &s;hakes his head, and with looks that be&s;poke a forced compliance, beckons to the centinels to withdraw their arms. Leave being thus obtain|ed, they a&s;cend; and having paid their homage, by kneeling fir&s;t to the image on the cro&s;s, and then to the Virgin Mary, they retired to the back of the &s;tage. Still the preacher continued declaim|ing, or rather, (as was &s;aid) explaining the mourn|ful &s;cene. Magdalen per&s;i&s;ts in wringing her hands, and variou&s;ly expre&s;&s;ing her per&s;onated &s;orrow; whil&s;t John (&s;eemingly regardle&s;s of all be&s;ides) &s;tood gazing on the crucified figure. By this time it was near three o'clock, and therefore proper for the &s;cene to clo&s;e. The ladders are a&s;cended, the &s;uper&s;cription and crown of thorns taken off, long white rollers put round the arms of the image, and and then the nails knocked out which fa&s;tened the hands and feet. Here Mary Magdalen looks mo&s;t langui&s;hing, and John, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;tands more thun|der&s;truck than before.&mdash;The orator lifts up his voice, and almo&s;t all the hearers expre&s;&s;ed concern by weeping, beating their brea&s;ts, and &s;miting their cheeks.&mdash;At length the body is gently let down. Magdalen eyes it, and, gradually ri&s;ing, receives the feet into her wide &s;pread handkerchief; whil&s;t John (who hitherto &s;tood motionle&s;s like a &s;tatue) as the body came near the ground, with an eager|ne&s;s that be&s;poke the inten&s;e affection of a &s;ympa|thizing friend, runs towards the cro&s;s, &s;eizes the upper part of it into his cla&s;ping arms, and, with his di&s;gui&s;ed fellow mourner, helps to bear it away. Great preparations were made for its interment. It was wrapped in linen and &s;pices, &amp;c. and being laid upon a bier richly hung, was afterwards car|ried round the church-yard in grand proce&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="203" REF="013298_0203_0F904DFD4F278FF8">
and in about a quarter of an hour the corp&s;e was brought in, and depo&s;ited with great ceremony in an open &s;epulchre, prepared for the purpo&s;e.</Q>
Up|on all which he &s;ays,
<Q>Surely, thought I, whil&s;t at|tending on &s;uch a &s;cene of mock devotion, if ever, now is the dear LORD JESUS crucified afre&s;h; and I could then, and even now, think of no other plea for the poor beguiled devotees, than that which &s;uffering innocence put up him&s;elf for his enemies, when actually hanging upon the cro&s;s, 'Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.</Q></P>

<P>In &s;pring 1757, he &s;et out again on his northern circuit, and came to Edinburgh in the month of May, when the General A&s;&s;embly of the Church of Scot|land held their annual meeting. He was much plea&s;|ed
<PB N="213" REF="013298_0213_0F8FFA700C1CAD70">
with this circum&s;tance. Many Mini&s;ters attended his &s;ermons, perhaps a hundred at a time. Thereby prejudices were removed, and many of them &s;eemed to be deeply affected. About thirty of them, as a token of re&s;pect, invited him to a public entertain|ment. The King's Commi&s;&s;ioner al&s;o invited him to his table.</P>
<P>Some of the Scotch clergy, who were prejudiced again&s;t Mr. Whitefield, took upon them to &s;ignify to the Commi&s;&s;ioner, (Lord Cathcart) by &s;ome of their friends, that it would be better not to invite Mr. Whitefield to his table; and that it would give of|fence. This overture his Grace received with indig|nation.</P>
<P>The Earl of L&mdash; al&s;o, who was King's Com|mi&s;&s;ioner before Lord Cathcart, &s;hewed particular at|tention to Mr. Whitefield: And from the time of his fir&s;t coming to Scotland, &s;hewed a great and con&s;tant regard for him.</P>
<P>Thou&s;ands, among whom were a great many of the be&s;t rank, daily attended his mini&s;trations, and the longer he &s;taid, the more the congregations increa&s;ed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letter MCLXVII.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>From Edinburgh he went to Gla&s;gow, where, hav|ing preached twice by the way, he arrived june 8th, and continued till the 14th, preaching, as u&s;ual, in the High church-yard, to great multitudes, morning and evening; be&s;ides on the Lord's-day, both fore|noon and afternoon, in one of the churches of the city. The poor in Gla&s;gow being at this time in ve|ry mournful circum&s;tances, notwith&s;tanding the va|rious &s;ources of &s;upply, he (with the countenance of the magi&s;trates) made a collection for them, at his &s;ermon on Monday evening, which amounted to near &s;ixty pounds. Next day he preached at Pai&s;ley; and from thence &s;et out for Ireland.</P>
<P>His fir&s;t reception was promi&s;ing as formerly. Con|gregations at Dublin were very large, and much af|fected.
<PB N="214" REF="013298_0214_0F904E07471CE470">
One of the Bi&s;hops told a Nobleman, (who repeated it to Mr. Whitefield) that he was glad he was come to rou&s;e the people. All &s;orts attended, and all &s;orts &s;eemed to be &s;truck with a religious concern<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letters MCLXVIII, LXIX.</NOTE>. But on Sunday afternoon, July 3. after preaching in Oxmantown-green, (a place frequented by the Or|mand and Liberty boys, as they call them, who often fight there) he narrowly e&s;caped with his life. It be|ing war time, he took occa&s;ion to exhort his hearers, (as was his u&s;ual practice) not only to fear God, but to honour the King; and prayed for &s;ucce&s;s to the King of Pru&s;&s;ia. In the time of &s;ermon and prayer, a few &s;tones were thrown at him, which did no hurt. But when he had done, and thought to return home, the way he came, by the barracks, to his great &s;ur|prize acce&s;s was denied; and he was obliged to go near half a mile, from one end of the Green to the other, through hundreds of Papi&s;ts, &amp;c. who finding him unattended, (for a &s;oldier, and four preachers who came with him, had fled) threw vollies of &s;tones upon him from all quarters, and made him reel backwards and forwards, till he was almo&s;t breathle&s;s, and all over a gore of blood.
<Q>I received many blows and wounds; one was particularly large, and near my temples. I thought of Stephen, and was in hopes, like him, to go off in this bloody triumph, to the immediate pre&s;ence of my Ma&s;ter<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Letter MCLXX.</NOTE>.</Q>
At la&s;t, with great difficulty, he &s;taggered to the door of a Mi|ni&s;ter's hou&s;e lying next to the Green, which was kindly opened to him. For a while he continued &s;peechle&s;s and panting for breath; but his weeping friends having given him &s;ome cordials, and wa&s;hed his wounds, a coach was procured, in which, amid&s;t the oaths, imprecations and threatnings of the Popi&s;h rabble, he got &s;afe home; and joined in a hymn of thank&s;giving with his friends, by whom, he &s;ays,
<Q>none but &s;pectators could form an idea of the affec|tion

with which he was received.</Q>
Next morning he &s;et out for Port Arlington,
<Q>leaving, (&s;ays he) my per&s;ecutors to his mercy, who of per&s;ecutors has often made preachers. I pray God, I may thus be avenged of them<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Letter MCLXX.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>After preaching at Port Arlington, Limerick, and Cork; the beginning of Augu&s;t he returned to Eng|land; and, while the weather permitted, continued to range (as he expre&s;&s;es it) preaching with great earne&s;tne&s;s every where.
<Q>This &s;piritual hunting, (&s;ays he) is delightful &s;port, when the heart is in the work<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letter MCLXXIV.</NOTE>.</Q>
At Plymouth he had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing officers, &s;oldiers, &s;ailors, &amp;c. attending his &s;ermons with the utmo&s;t &s;olemnity. In Exeter al&s;o, Bri&s;tol, Glouce&s;ter, and Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, he had de|lightful &s;ea&s;ons. About the middle of October 1757, he returned to London.</P>
<P>His attendance this winter on both the Chapel and the Tabernacle, together with his thoughtfulne&s;s, greatly impaired his health. He was troubled with continual vomitings, got little &s;leep, and had no appe|tite. Still, however, he went on as well as he could.
<Q>I am brought, now<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Letter MCLXXXVII.</NOTE>, (&s;ays he) to the &s;hort allow|ance of preaching but once a day, and thrice on a Sunday.</Q>
But when he was not preaching, he was projecting &s;ome &s;cheme or other for the advance|ment of religion: for in&s;tance the building of alms-hou&s;es for pious widows, on the ground that &s;urround|ed his Chapel.
<Q>I have a plan, (&s;ays he) for twelve. The whole expence will be four hundred pounds. I have got a pro&s;pect of two. I propo&s;e allowing each widow half a crown a week. The Sacrament money will more than do. If this be effected many godly widows will be provided for, and a &s;tanding monument left that the Methodi&s;ts were not again&s;t good works<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Letters MCLXXXVII, MCLXXXIX.</NOTE>.</Q>
It was not long till
<PB N="216" REF="013298_0216_0F904E092DD91750">
this plan was put into execution. The foundation of the alms-hou&s;es was laid February 16, 1758, and the widows began to be admitted in June following.</P>
<P>He began his &s;ummer-circuit this year at Glouce&s;|ter: from thence he went to Bri&s;tol, and then to Wales. When he was in Wales he was brought very low in his health. He was not able to &s;it up in company, as he u&s;ed to do; and could take very little food. Yet continued travelling and preaching twice a day, through various towns in South Wales, where multi|tudes attended; on Sundays the numbers were al|mo&s;t incredible<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letters MCCIII, MCCVI.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the month of July he &s;et off for Scotland. In his way he preached at Everton, St. Neots, Kay&s;o, Bedford, Oulney, We&s;ton, Underwood, Raven&s;tone, Northampton, and Newca&s;tle. Four Clergymen lent him their pulpits. His bodily &s;trength increa&s;ed &s;o little by this journey, that he &s;ometimes had thoughts of turning back. But this he did not think to be his duty.
<Q>Through divine &s;trength, (&s;ays he) I hope to go forward, and &s;hall &s;trive, as much as in me lies, to die in this glorious work<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Letter MCCIX.</NOTE>.</Q>
Yet it plea&s;ed God to re&s;tore his health in a good mea&s;ure, &s;oon after his arrival in Scotland. From Edinburgh he writes, Augu&s;t 19 and 24.
<Q>For the&s;e four months la&s;t pa&s;t, I have been brought &s;o exceed|ing low in my body, that I was in hopes, every &s;ermon I preached would waft me to my wi&s;hed for home.

<P>This winter his negociations about the intended college at Bethe&s;da, came to an i&s;&s;ue. A memorial, addre&s;&s;ed to his Maje&s;ty, was put into the hands of the clerk of the privy council, &s;etting forth the great utility of a college in that place to the inhabitants of the &s;outhern provinces, and praying that a charter might be granted upon the plan of the college at New-Jer&s;ey. This memorial was by him tran&s;mit|ted to the Lord Pre&s;ident, and by his Lord&s;hip refer|red to the con&s;ideration of the Archbi&s;hop of Canter|bury, to whom al&s;o a draft of an intended charter was pre&s;ented by the Earl of D&mdash;h. Upon which an epi&s;tolary corre&s;pondence en&s;ued betwixt the Arch|bi&s;hop and Mr. Whitefield; the &s;um of which was, the Archbi&s;hop put the draft of the charter in the hands of the Lord P. who promi&s;ed to con&s;ider it and gave it as his opinion, that
<Q>the head of the college ought to be a member of the Church of Engli&s;h of

Mr. Whitefield an&s;wered, he could not agree to either of the&s;e re&s;trictions, becau&s;e the greate&s;t part of the Orphan-hou&s;e collections and contributions came from di&s;&s;enters; and becau&s;e he had frequently de|clared the intended college was to be founded upon
<Q>a broad bottom, and no other. This, &s;ays he, I judged I was &s;ufficiently warranted to do, from the known, long e&s;tabli&s;hed, mild, and uncoercive genius of the Engli&s;h government; al&s;o from your grace's moderation towards prote&s;tant di&s;&s;enters; from the unconquerable attachment of the Ameri|cans to toleration-principles, as well as from the avowed habitual feelings and &s;entiments of my own heart. This being the ca&s;e,&mdash;and as your grace by your &s;ilence &s;eems to be like-minded with the Lord P&mdash;t; and as your grace's and his lord&s;hip's influence will undoubtedly extend it|&s;elf to others, I would beg leave, after returning all due acknowledgments, to inform your grace that I intend troubling your grace and his lord|&s;hip no more about this &s;o long depending con|cern. As it hath plea&s;ed the great head of the church in &s;ome degree to renew my bodily &s;trength, I purpo&s;e now to renew my feeble efforts, and turn the charity into a more generous, and con&s;equently into a more exten&s;ively u&s;eful chan|nel. I have no ambition to be looked upon as the founder of a college; but I would fain act the part of an hone&s;t man, a di&s;intere&s;ted Mini&s;ter of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and a truly catholic, moderate pre&s;|byter of the church of England<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See his Works, vol.

Being quite unea&s;y, le&s;t by &s;taying longer I &s;hould be unready, if the wind &s;hould turn favourable, I went early on Sun|day morning to Deal, and from thence immediate|ly on board, and preached in the afternoon. This morning came a &s;urreptitious copy of my Taber|nacle Farewell Sermon, taken, as the &s;hort-hand writer profe&s;&s;es, <HI>verbatim,</HI> as I &s;poke it. But &s;urely he is mi&s;taken. The whole is &s;o injudiciou&s;ly paragraphed, and &s;o wretchedly unconnected, that I owe no thanks to the mi&s;guided, though it may be well-meant zeal of the writer and publisher, be they who they will. But &s;uch conduct is an una|voidable tax upon popularity. And all that appear for Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and his ble&s;&s;ed Go&s;pel, much like their ma&s;ter, expect to &s;uffer from the fal&s;e fire of profe&s;&s;ing friends, as well as &s;ecret malice of avow|ed enemies. However, if any one &s;entence is ble&s;|&s;ed to the conviction of one &s;inner, or the edificati|on of any individual &s;aint, I care not what becomes

of my character, though I would always pray to be pre&s;erved from bringing upon my&s;elf, or others, needle&s;s, unnece&s;&s;ary contempt.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Monday, September 25. Weighed anchor la&s;t Tue&s;day morning, with a &s;mall favourable gale and fine weather. So many &s;hips which had lain in the Downs, moving at the &s;ame time, and gent|ly gliding by us, together with the pro&s;pect of the adjacent &s;hore, made a mo&s;t agreeable &s;cene. But it proved only a very tran&s;ient one. For by that time we got to Fairlee, the wind backened, clouds gathered, very violent gales &s;ucceeded, and for &s;e|veral days we were &s;o to&s;&s;ed, that after coming over again&s;t Brighthelm&s;tone, the Captain rightly judging, turned back, (as did many other &s;hips) and anchored over again&s;t New Rum&s;ey and Dungene&s;s.&mdash;Lord, in thine own time, thou wilt give the winds a commi&s;&s;ion to carry us forward towards our de&s;ired port.</Q></P>
<P>At la&s;t they got out of the Channel, and on the 30th of November, arrived at Charle&s;town, in South-Caro|lina. It had been a dangerous and trying pa&s;&s;age; yet, on his arrival, he found him&s;elf in better health than at the end of any voyage he had made for &s;everal years; and the &s;ame day that he came a&s;hore, he preached at Charle&s;town, where his recep|tion was as hearty, or heartier than ever.
<Q>For the la&s;t week (November 1769) we were beating about our port, within &s;ight of it, and confined for two days in five-fathom-hole, ju&s;t over the bar. A dangerous &s;ituation, as the wind blew hard, and our &s;hip, like a young chri&s;tian, for want of more bal|la&s;t, would not obey the helm. But through in|finite mercy, on November 30, a pilot-boat came and took us &s;afe a&s;hore to Charle&s;town, after being on board almo&s;t thirteen weeks. Friends received me mo&s;t cordially.&mdash;Prai&s;e the Lord, O my &s;oul,

invited by the Rev. Mr. George Whitefield, attend|ed at divine &s;ervice in the Chapel of the Orphan-hou&s;e Academy, where prayers were read by the Rev. Mr. Ellington, and a very &s;uitable &s;ermon was preached by the Rev. Mr. Whitefield from Zecha|riah iv. 10. 'For who hath de&s;pi&s;ed the day of &s;mall things?' to the general &s;atisfaction of the auditory; in which he took occa&s;ion to mention the many di&s;couragements he met with, well known to many there, in carrying on this in&s;tituti|on for upwards of thirty years pa&s;t, and the pre&s;ent promi&s;ing pro&s;pect of its future and more exten&s;ive u&s;efulne&s;s. After divine &s;ervice, the company were very politely entertained with a hand&s;ome and plentiful dinner; and were greatly plea&s;ed to &s;ee the u&s;eful improvements made in the hou&s;e, the two additional wings for apartments for &s;tudents, one hundred and fifty feet each in length, and other le&s;&s;er buildings, in &s;o much forwardne&s;s, and the whole executed with ta&s;te, and in a ma&s;terly manner; and being &s;en&s;ible of the truly generous and di&s;intere&s;ted benefactions derived to the pro|vince through his means, they expre&s;&s;ed their gra|titude in the mo&s;t re&s;pectful terms.</Q></P>
<P>Soon after this he writes from Charle&s;town, Febru|ary 10.
<Q>Through mercy, I enjoy a greater &s;hare of bodily health than I have known for many years. I am now enabled to preach almo&s;t every day. Ble&s;&s;ed be God, all things are in great forwardne&s;s at Bethe&s;da.

He mo&s;t readily con&s;ents. I have &s;hown him a draught, which he much approves of; and all will be fini&s;hed at my return from the northward. In the mean while the buildings will be carried on.</Q>
He adds,

<P>And, New-York, June 30, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Letter MCCCCLXII.</NOTE>
<Q>Next week I pur|po&s;e to go to Albany. From thence, perhaps, to the Oneida Indians. There is to be a very large Indian congre&s;s. Mr. Kirkland accompanies me.

In his memorandum-book is the fol|lowing remark:
<Q>July 2, 1770. Sailed from New-York with Mr. Kirkland, and two kind old friends, and arrived at Albany, July 6. Was kindly received by Mr. Bays and Domine We&s;taloe. Preached the &s;ame evening, and went the next day to &s;ee the Cohoes Falls, twelve miles from Albany. O thou wonder-working God! Preached twice on the Lord's day at Albany, and the next day at Schenectady, and was &s;truck at the delightful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ation of the place. Heard aftewards that the word ran, and was glorified both there and at Albany. Grace, Grace!</Q></P>
<P>And again, from New-York, July 29, he writes, <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Letter MCCCCLXIII.</NOTE>
<Q>During this month I have been above a five hun|dred miles circuit, and have been enabled to preach and travel through the heat every day. The congregations have been very large, attentive, and affected, particularly at Albany, Schenectady, Great Bamington, Norfolk, Sali&s;bury, Sharon, Smithfield, Powkeep&s;ie, Fi&s;h-Kill, New-Rumbart, New-Wind|&s;or,

At this la&s;t place he preached in the open air, to accommodate the multitudes that came to hear him, no hou&s;e being able to contain them. He continued his di&s;cour&s;e near two hours, was greatly fatigued, and in the afternoon &s;et out for Newbury-Port, where he arrived that evening; went early to bed, it being Saturday night, intending to preach the next day. He awaked &s;everal times in the night, and complained much of a difficulty of breath|ing. At &s;ix o'clock on the Lord's day morning, he expired in a fit of the a&s;thma.</P>
<P>Mr. Richard Smith, who accompanied Mr. White|field from England to America the la&s;t time, and in his journeyings when there, to the time of his death, hath given a particular account of his death and inter|ment, which it may not be improper to in&s;ert.</P>
<P><Q>On Saturday, Sept. 29, 1770, Mr. Whitefield rode from Port&s;mouth to Exeter (fifteen miles) in the morning, and preached there to a very great multitude in the fields. It is remarkable, that be|fore he went out to preach that day, (which prov|ed to be his la&s;t &s;ermon) Mr. Clark&s;on, &s;enior, ob|&s;erving him more unea&s;y than u&s;ual, &s;aid to him, 'Sir, you are more fit to go to bed than to preach.' To which Mr. Whitefield an&s;wered, 'True, Sir:' but turning a&s;ide, he cla&s;ped his hands together, and, looking up, &s;poke, 'Lord Je&s;us, I am weary in thy work, but not of thy work. If I have not yet fini&s;hed my cour&s;e, let me go and &s;peak for thee once more in the fields, &s;eal thy truth, and come home and die.' The text he preached from was, 2 Cor. xiii. 5. 'Examine your&s;elves, whether ye be is

the faith; prove your own &s;elves: know ye not your own &s;elves, how that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is in you, except ye be reprobates?' He dined at Captain Gillman's. After dinner, Mr. Whitefield and Mr. Par&s;ons rode to Newbury. I did not get there till two hours after them. I found them at &s;upper. I a&s;ked Mr. Whitefield how he felt him&s;elf after his journey. He &s;aid, 'he was tired, therefore he &s;upped early, and would go to bed.' He eat a ve|ry little &s;upper, talked but little, a&s;ked Mr. Par|&s;ons to di&s;charge the table, and perform family du|ty; and then retired up &s;tairs. He &s;aid, 'that he would &s;it and read till I came to him,' which I did as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, and found him reading in the Bible, with Dr. Watts's P&s;alms lying open before him. He a&s;ked me for &s;ome water-gruel, and took about half his u&s;ual quantity, and kneeling down by the bed&s;ide, clo&s;ed the evening with prayer. Af|ter a little conver&s;ation, he went to re&s;t and &s;lept till two in the morning, when he awoke me, and a&s;ked for a little cyder; be drank about a wine gla&s;s full. I a&s;ked him how he felt, for he &s;eemed to pant for breath. He told me, 'His a&s;thma was coming on him again; I mu&s;t have two or three days re&s;t&punc; Two or three days riding, without preaching, would &s;et me up again.' Soon afterwards he a&s;ked me to put the window up a little higher, (though it was half up all night) for, &s;aid he, 'I cannot breathe, but I hope I &s;hall be better by and by; a good pulpit-&s;weat to-day may give me relief; I &s;hall be better after preaching.' I &s;aid to him, I wi&s;hed he would not preach &s;o often. He replied, 'I had rather wear out, than ru&s;t out.' I then told him, I was afraid he took cold in preaching ye&s;ter|day. He &s;aid, 'He believed he had;' and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;at up in the bed and prayed, that God would be plea&s;ed to ble&s;s his preaching where he had been, and al&s;o ble&s;s his preaching that day, that more

&s;ouls might be brought to Chri&s;t, and prayed for direction, whether he &s;hould winter at Bo&s;ton, or ha&s;ten to the &s;outhward: prayed for a ble&s;&s;ing on his Bethe&s;da College, and his dear family there; for Tabernacle and Chapel congregations, and all his connections on the other &s;ide the water, and then laid him&s;elf down to &s;leep again. This was nigh three o'clock. At a quarter pa&s;t four he wak|ed, and &s;aid, 'My a&s;thma, my a&s;thma is coming on, I wi&s;h I had not given out word to preach at Haverhill on Monday; I don't think I &s;hall be able: but, I &s;hall &s;ee what to-day will bring forth. If I am no better to-morrow, I will take a two or three days ride.' He then de&s;ired me to warm him a little gruel, and in breaking the fire-wood, I waked Mr. Par&s;ons; who thinking I knocked for him, ro&s;e and came in. He went to Mr. White|field's bed&s;ide, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ked him how he felt him&s;elf. He an&s;wered, 'I am almo&s;t &s;uffocated, I can &s;carce breathe: my a&s;thma quite choaks me.' I was then not a little &s;urprized, to hear how quick and with what difficulty he drew his breath. He got out of bed, and went to the open window for air. This was exactly at five o'clock. I went to him, and for about the &s;pace of five minutes, I &s;aw no dan|ger, only that he had a great difficulty in breath|ing, as I had often &s;een before. Soon afterwards he turned him&s;elf to me, and &s;aid, 'I am dying.' I &s;aid, I hope not, Sir. He ran to the other win|dow panting for breathing, but could get no re|lief. It was agreed I &s;hould go for Dr. Sawyer; and on my coming back, I &s;aw death on his face, and he again &s;aid, 'I am dying.' His eyes were fixed, his under lip drawing inward every time he drew breath; he went towards the window, and he offered him &s;ome warm wine with Lavender drops, which he refu&s;ed. I per&s;uaded him to &s;it down in the chair, and have his cloak on; he con|&s;ented
<PB N="253" REF="013298_0253_0F8FFA79CBCC5320">
by a &s;ign, but could not &s;peak. I then of|fered him the gla&s;s of warm wine; he took half of it, but it &s;eemed as if it would have &s;topped his breath entirely. In a little time he brought up a con&s;iderable quantity of phlegm and wind. I then began to have &s;ome &s;mall hopes. Mr. Par&s;ons &s;aid, he thought Mr. Whitefield breathed more freely than he did, and would recover. I &s;aid, no, Sir, he is certainly dying. I was continually employ|ed in taking the phlegm out of his mouth with a handkerchief, and bathing his temples with drops, rubbing his wri&s;ts, &amp;c. to give him relief, if po&s;|&s;ible; but all in vain, his hands and feet were cold as clay. When the Doctor came in, and &s;aw him in the chair leaning on my brea&s;t, he felt his pul&s;e, and &s;aid, 'He is a dead man.' Mr. Par&s;ons &s;aid&punc; 'I do not believe it, you mu&s;t do &s;omething Doc|tor.' He &s;aid, 'I cannot; he is now near his la&s;t breath.' And indeed &s;o it was, for he fetched but one ga&s;p, and &s;tretched out his feet, and breathed no more. This was exactly at &s;ix o'clock. We continued rubbing his legs and hands and feet with warm cloths, and bathed him with &s;pirits for &s;ome time, but all in vain. I then put him into a warm bed, the Doctor &s;tanding by, and often rai&s;ed him upright, continued rubbing him and putting &s;pirits to his no&s;e for an hour, till all hopes w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e.

Mr. Par&s;ons where &s;everal of them gave a very particular ac|count of their fir&s;t awakening under his mini&s;try,
<PB N="254" REF="013298_0254_0F8FFA7A8A84EAB8">
&s;everal years ago, and al&s;o of many in their con|gregations, that to their knowledge, under God, owed their conver&s;ion wholly to his coming among them, often repeating the ble&s;&s;ed &s;ea&s;ons they had enjoyed under his preaching: and all &s;aid, that this la&s;t vi&s;it was attended with more power than any other, and that all oppo&s;ition fell before him. Then one and another of them would pity and pray for his dear Tabernacle and Chapel congregations, and it was truly affecting to hear them bemoan A|merica and England's lo&s;s. Thus they continued for two hours conver&s;ing about his great u&s;efulne&s;s, and praying that God would &s;catter his gifts and drop his mantle among them. When the corp&s;e was placed at the foot of the pulpit, clo&s;e to the vault, the Rev. Mr. Daniel Rogers made a very af|fecting prayer, and openly confe&s;&s;ed, that under God, he owed his conver&s;ion to the labours of that dear Man of God, who&s;e precious remains now lay before them. Then he cried out, 'O my father, my father!' then &s;topt and wept, as though his heart would break, and the people weeping all through the place. Then he recovered, and fini&s;h|ed his prayer and &s;at down and wept. Then one of the Deacons gave out that hymn, 'Why do we mourn departing friends?' Some of the people weeping, &s;ome &s;inging, and &s;o on alternately. The Rev. Mr. Jewel preached a funeral di&s;cour&s;e, and made an affectionate addre&s;s to his brethren to lay to heart the death of that u&s;eful man of God; beg|ging that he and they might be upon their watch-tower, and endeavour to follow his ble&s;&s;ed exam|ple. The corp&s;e was then put into the vault, and all concluded with a &s;hort prayer, and dimi&s;&s;ion of the people, who went weeping through the &s;treets to their re&s;pective places of abode.</Q></P>
<P>The melancholy news of Mr. Whitefield's death reached London on Monday, November 5, 1770,
<PB N="255" REF="013298_0255_0F8FFA7B95FF1A80">
by the Bo&s;ton Gazette, and by three letters from dif|ferent per&s;ons at Bo&s;ton, to his friend Mr. Keen, who al&s;o by the &s;ame po&s;t received two of his own hand-writing, written in health: one &s;even, and the other five days before his death. Mr. Keen had the melan|choly event notified the &s;ame night at the Tabernacle, and the next night at Tottenham-Court Chapel. His next &s;tep was to con&s;ider of a proper per&s;on to preach the funeral &s;ermon; and recollecting he had often &s;aid to Mr. Whitefield, If you &s;hould die abroad, whom &s;hall we get to preach your funeral &s;ermon? Mu&s;t it be your old friend the Rev. Mr. John We&s;ley? And hav|ing received con&s;tantly for an&s;wer, "He is the man." Mr. Keen accordingly waited on the Rev. Mr. We&s;|ley on the Saturday following, and engaged him to preach it on the Lord's day, November 18, which he did to a very large, crowded, and mournful audito|ry: many hundreds going away, who could not po&s;|&s;ibly get in.</P>
<P>In both the places of wor&s;hip, the pulpits, &amp;c. were hung with black cloth, and the galleries with fine black baize. The pulpits had e&s;cutcheons placed in the front, and on each of the hou&s;es adjoining, hatch|ments were put up: The motto on each was, "<HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> vita Salus &amp; Gloria Chri&s;tus.</HI>" Six months exp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d be|fore the mourning was taken down, and the e&s;cutche|ons hung up in each ve&s;try.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXI.</HI> A De&s;cription of his Per&s;on; a Review of his Life; and the mo&s;t &s;triking Parts of his Character pointed out.</HEAD>
<P>HIS per&s;on was graceful, and well proportioned: his &s;tature rather above the middle &s;ize. His complexion was very fair. His eyes were of a dark blue colour, and &s;mall, but &s;prightly. He had a &s;quint with one of them. Occa&s;ioned either by the ignorance, or the carele&s;sne&s;s of the nur&s;e who attended him in the mea&s;les, when he was about four years old. His features were in general good and regular. His countenance was manly, and his voice exceeding &s;trong; yet both were &s;oftened with an uncommon degree of &s;weetne&s;s. He was always very clean and neat, and often &s;aid plea&s;antly
<Q>that a Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel ought to be without &s;pot.</Q>
His deport|ment was decent and ea&s;y, without the lea&s;t &s;tiffne&s;s or formality: and his engaging polite manner made his company univer&s;ally agreeable. In his youth he was &s;lender, and moved his body with great agility to action, &s;uitable to his di&s;cour&s;e; but about the for|tieth year of his age, he began to grow corpulent; which however was &s;olely the effect of his di&s;ea&s;e, being always, even to a proverb, remarkable for his moderation both in eating and drinking.</P>
<P>In reviewing the life of this extraordinary man, the following particulars appear very remarkable.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, we are &s;truck with his unwearied diligence in the office of religion, and his con&s;cientious improve|ment of every portion of his time. Early in the morning he ro&s;e to his Ma&s;ter's work, and all the day long was employed in a continual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of dif|ferent duties. Take a view of his public conduct; here he is engaged either in preaching the Go&s;pel, in vi&s;iting and giving coun&s;el to the afflicted, in in&s;truct|ing
<PB N="258" REF="013298_0258_0F904E27766FA758">
the ignorant, or in celebrating the prai&s;es of God. Ob&s;erve his behaviour in private company; there you hear him introducing, upon all occa&s;ions, and among all &s;orts of people, di&s;cour&s;e that tended to edification. And if you follow him to his retirements; you &s;ee him writing devout meditations upon the oc|currences of the day, or letters to his chri&s;tian ac|quaintance full of piety and zeal. What a gloomy idea mu&s;t a &s;tranger to vital piety entertain of a life &s;pent in this manner? He will think it mu&s;t have been not only joyle&s;s and di&s;gu&s;ting, but intolerably burthen&s;ome. Far otherwi&s;e did it appear in the ex|perience of this &s;ervant of Chri&s;t. He felt the great|e&s;t enjoyment when engaged in a con&s;tant round of &s;ocial and religious duties. In the&s;e, whole weeks pa&s;t away like one day. And when he was vi&s;ited with any di&s;tre&s;s or affliction, preaching, as he tells us him&s;elf, was his catholicon, and prayer his antidote again&s;t every trial. The plea&s;ure of a man of bu&s;ine&s;s in &s;ucce&s;sfully pu&s;hing his trade, or of a philo&s;opher when pur&s;uing his favourite &s;tudies, may give us &s;ome faint conception of the joys which he felt: yet &s;o ar|dent were his de&s;ires after the heavenly happine&s;s, that he often longed to fini&s;h his work, and to go home to his Saviour.
<Q>Ble&s;&s;ed be God, the pro&s;pect of death is plea&s;ant to my &s;oul. I would not live here always.</Q>
I want to be gone<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letter CCXLVIII.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><Q>Sometimes it ari&s;es from a fear of falling. Some|times from a pro&s;pect of future labours and &s;uffer|ings. But the&s;e are times when my &s;oul hath &s;uch foreta&s;tes of God, that I long more eagerly to be with Him; and the pro&s;pect of the happine&s;s which the &s;pirits of ju&s;t men made perfect now enjoy, often carries me, as it were, into another world.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Letter XCVI.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>Again, we are ju&s;tly &s;urprized at his frequent and fervent preaching under all the di&s;advantages of a
<PB N="259" REF="013298_0259_0F904E28AC9C6900">
&s;ickly con&s;titution, and the many fits of illne&s;s with which he was &s;uddenly &s;eized. It mu&s;t indeed be confe&s;&s;ed, that change of air, frequent travelling on hor&s;eback, and the many voyages he made, might contribute to the pre&s;ervation of his health and vi|gour: but when we con&s;ider what exertion of voice was nece&s;&s;ary to reach his large congregations; that he preached generally twice or thrice every day, and often four times on the Lord's day; but above all, what wa&s;te of &s;trength and &s;pirits every &s;ermon mu&s;t have co&s;t him, through the earne&s;tne&s;s of his delivery; it is truly a&s;toni&s;hing, how his con&s;titution could hold out &s;o long <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">"I preach till I &s;weat through and through." Letter XLVI.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But there is another circum&s;tance not le&s;s remark|able than either of the former, which is, the uncom|mon de&s;ire that all &s;orts of people expre&s;&s;ed to attend his preaching; and that not upon the fir&s;t or &s;econd vi&s;it only, but at every &s;ucceeding opportunity. Wherever he went, prodigious numbers flocked to hear him. His congregations often con&s;i&s;ted of four or five thou&s;and: in populous places they &s;welled to ten, &s;ometimes fourteen: and upon &s;ome occa&s;ions the concour&s;e was &s;o great, that they have been com|puted to be from twenty to thirty thou&s;and.</P>
<P>It is wonderful to think how he commanded the attention of &s;uch multitudes; with what compo&s;ure they li&s;tened when he began to &s;peak; how they hung upon his lips, and were often di&s;&s;olved in tears: and this was the ca&s;e with per&s;ons of the mo&s;t hardy and rugged, as well as tho&s;e of &s;ofter tempers.</P>
<P>His eloquence was indeed very great, and of the true&s;t and noble&s;t kind. He was utterly devoid of all appearance of affectation. He &s;eemed to be quite uncon&s;cious of the talents he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. The impor|tance of his &s;ubject, and the regard due to his hearers, engro&s;&s;ed all his concern. He &s;pake like one who
<PB N="260" REF="013298_0260_0F904E296A4A6698">
did not &s;eek their applau&s;e, but was concerned for their be&s;t intere&s;ts, and who, from a principle of un|feigned love, earne&s;tly endeavoured to lead them in the right way. And the effect in &s;ome mea&s;ure cor|re&s;ponded to the de&s;ign. They did not amu&s;e them|&s;elves with commending his di&s;cour&s;es; but being moved and per&s;uaded by what he &s;aid, entered into his views, felt his pa&s;&s;ions, and were willing, for that time at lea&s;t, to comply with all his reque&s;ts. This was e&s;pecially remarkable at his charity &s;ermons<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Which he preached for a great many others, be&s;ide his own orphans in Georgia. See his life.</NOTE>, when the worldly-minded were made to part with their money in &s;o generous a manner, that when they returned to their former temper, they were ready to think that it had been conjured from them by &s;ome inexplicable charm. The charm, however, was no|thing el&s;e than the power of his irre&s;i&s;tible eloquence, in which re&s;pect it is not ea&s;y to &s;ay, whether he was ever excelled either in ancient or modern times.</P>
<P>He had a &s;trong and mu&s;ical voice, and a wonderful command of it. His pronunciation was not only proper, but manly and graceful. Nor was he ever at a lo&s;s for the mo&s;t natural and &s;trong expre&s;&s;ions. Yet the&s;e in him were but lower qualities. The grand &s;ources of his eloquence were an exceeding lively imagination, which made people think they &s;aw what he de&s;cribed; and action &s;till more lively if po&s;&s;ible, by which, while every accent of his voice &s;poke to the ear, every feature of his face, every mo|tion of his hands, and every ge&s;ture &s;poke to the eye; &s;o that the mo&s;t di&s;&s;ipated and thoughtle&s;s found their attention involuntarily fixed, and the dulle&s;t and mo&s;t ignorant could not but under&s;tand. He had likewi&s;e a certain elevation of mind, which rai&s;ed him equal|ly above prai&s;e and cen&s;ure, and added great authori|ty to whatever he &s;aid. The natural language of this chri&s;tian fortitude was,
<Q>The Lord only knows
<PB N="261" REF="013298_0261_0F904E2AB13DD9A8">
how he will be plea&s;ed to di&s;po&s;e of me; great afflictions I am &s;ure of having; and a &s;udden death, ble&s;&s;ed be God, will not be terrible. I know that my Redeemer liveth. I every day long to &s;ee Him, that I may be free from the remainder of &s;in, and enjoy Him without interruption, for|ever <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Letter CCLXXXIII.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>But what was perhaps the mo&s;t important of all, he had a heart deeply exerci&s;ed in all the &s;ocial, as well as the pious and religious affections, and was at the &s;ame time mo&s;t remarkably communicative, by which means he was peculiarly fitted to awaken like feelings in others, and &s;o &s;ympathize with every one that had them.</P>
<P>This la&s;t, &s;ome have thought was the di&s;tingui&s;h|ing part of his character. It was certainly, however, an eminent part of it. In his journals and letters, an impartial reader will find in&s;tances thereof almo&s;t in every page: &s;uch as, lively gratitude to God in the fir&s;t place, and to all whom God had u&s;ed as in&s;tru|ments of good to him: &s;incere love in dealing &s;o plainly with his corre&s;pondents about the intere&s;t of their &s;ouls <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">See particularly Letter CXVIII.</NOTE>: frequent and particular interce&s;&s;ion for his friends, his enemies, and all mankind: great de|light in the &s;ociety of chri&s;tian acquaintance: many very &s;orrowful partings, and joyful meetings with his friends: tender heartedne&s;s to the afflicted: the plea|&s;ure in procuring and admini&s;tring &s;ea&s;onable &s;up|ply to the indi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt: and conde&s;cen&s;ion to people of the lowe&s;t rank, to in&s;truct and conver&s;e with them for their good, in as kind and &s;ociable a manner, as if he had been their brother or intimate friend. The&s;e are manife&s;t proofs that he had a heart ea&s;ily &s;u&s;ep|tible of every humane, tender, and compa&s;&s;ionate feel|ing. And this was certainly a great mean of enabling him &s;o &s;trongly to affect the hearts of others.</P>

By this de&s;cription, he was far from intending to confine true religion to the ex|erci&s;es of devotion.

This is the morality which we preach.</Q>
He u&s;ed al&s;o to give this definition of true religion,
<Q>that it is a univer&s;al morality founded upon love of God, and faith in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</Q>
Licen|tiou&s;ne&s;s and luxury, and all &s;orts of time-wa&s;ting and di&s;&s;ipating amu&s;ements, how fa&s;hionable &s;oever, he con&s;tantly inveighed again&s;t. The&s;e were the topics on which he employed his eloquence.</P>
<P>But not to dwell any longer on his accompli&s;hments as an orator, and the excellent purpo&s;es to which, through the grace of God, he devoted them; one thing remains to be mentioned, of an infinite high|er order than any human powers whatever: and that is, the power of God, which &s;o remarkably ac|companied the labours of his &s;ervant, and without which both Scripture and experience teach us, that all external means, however excellent, are ineffectual and vain.

From the&s;e, though they contain nothing materially different from the above accounts, yet the reader will probably not be di&s;plea&s;ed to &s;ee the following ex|tracts; as they not only &s;et the character of Mr. Whitefield in a variety of lights, but are &s;o many te&s;|timonies to it, by witne&s;&s;es of undoubted credit, in different parts of the world.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t was preached by Mr. Par&s;ons, the very day on which he died, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Early next morning Mr. Sherburn of Port&s;mouth, &s;ent Squire Clark&s;on and Dr. Haven, with a me&s;&s;age to Mr. Par&s;ons, de&s;iring Mr. Whitefield's remains might be buried in his own new tomb, at his own expence: and in the evening &s;everal Gentlemen from Bo&s;ton came to Mr. Par&s;ons, de&s;iring the body might be carried there. But as Mr. Whitefield had repeat|edly de&s;ired he might be buried before Mr. Par&s;ons's pulpit, if he died at Newbury-Port, Mr. Par&s;ons thought him&s;elf obliged to deny both of the&s;e reque&s;ts. The following account of his interment, is &s;ubjoined to his &s;ermon, viz. "October 2, 1770. At one o'clock all the bells in town were tolled for half an hour, and all the ve&s;&s;els in the harbour gave their proper &s;ignals of mourning. At two o'clock the bells tolled a &s;econd time. At three the bells called to attend the funeral. The Rev. Dr. Samuel Haven of Port&s;mouth, the Rev. Me&s;&s;ieurs Daniel Rogers of Exeter, Jedediah Jewet, and James Chandler of Rowley, Mo&s;es Par&s;ons of Newbury, and Edward Ba&s;s of Newbury-Port, were pall-bearers. The proce&s;&s;ion was from the Rev. Mr. Par&s;ons's of Newbury-Port, where Mr. Whitefield died. Mr. Par&s;ons and his family together with many other re&s;pectable per&s;ons followed the corp&s;e in mourning. The proce&s;&s;ion was only one mile, and then the corp&s;e was carried into the Pre&s;byterian church, and placed on the bier in the broad-alley, when the Rev. Mr. Rogers made a very &s;uitable prayer in the pre&s;ence of about &s;ix thou&s;and per&s;ons, within the walls of the church, while many thou&s;ands were on the out&s;ide, not being able to find admittance. Then, the third hymn of the &s;econd book of Dr. Watts's Spiritual Songs was &s;ung by the congregation. After this, the corp&s;e was put into a new tomb, before Mr. Par&s;ons's pulpit, which the Gentlemen of the congregation had prepared for that purpo&s;e; and be|fore it was &s;ealed, the Rev. Mr. Jewet gave a &s;uit|able exhortation, &amp;c."</P>

to live is Chri&s;t, and to die is gain." And this is the character he gives of his departed friend.</P>
<P>"Chri&s;t became a principle of &s;piritual life in his &s;oul, while he was an under-graduate at the Univer|&s;ity in Oxford. Before his conver&s;ion he was a Pha|ri&s;ee of the Phari&s;ees, as &s;trict as ever Paul was, be|fore God met him on his way to Dama&s;cus, according to his own declaration in his la&s;t &s;ermon, which I heard him preach at Exeter, ye&s;terday. He was, by means of reading, a very &s;earching, puritanical writer, convinced of the rottenne&s;s of all the duties he had done, and the danger of a &s;elf-righteous foundation of
<PB N="268" REF="013298_0268_0F904E300698CC08">
hope. When he heard Chri&s;t &s;peak to him in the Go&s;pel, he cried, 'Lord what wilt thou have me to 
<PB N="269" REF="013298_0269_0F904E315A440790">
do?' And it &s;eems as if, at that time, it had been made known to him that he was a cho&s;en ve&s;&s;el, to bear the name of Chri&s;t Je&s;us through the Briti&s;h Nation and her Colonies: to &s;tand before Kings and Nobles, and all &s;orts of people, to preach Chri&s;t, and him crucified. From that time the dawns of &s;alvati|on had living power in his heart, and he had an ar|dent de&s;ire to furni&s;h him&s;elf for the Go&s;pel mini&s;try. To this end, be&s;ides the u&s;ual &s;tudies at the college, he gave him&s;elf to reading the Holy Scriptures, to meditation and prayer; and particularly, he read Mr. Henry's Annotations on the Bible, upon his knees before God.</P>
<P>"Since my fir&s;t acquaintance with him, which is about thirty years ago, I have highly e&s;teemed him, as an excellent Chri&s;tian, and an eminent Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel. An heart &s;o bent for Chri&s;t, with &s;uch a &s;prightly active genius, could not admit of his &s;tat|ed fixed re&s;idence, in one place, as the pa&s;tor of a particular congregation; and therefore, he cho&s;e to itinerate from place to place, and from one country to another; which indeed was much better &s;uited to his talents, than a fixed abode would have been. I often con&s;idered him as an angel flying through the mid&s;t of heaven, with the everla&s;ting Go&s;pel, to preach unto them that dwell on the earth; for he preached the uncorrupted word of God, and gave &s;o|lemn warnings again&s;t all corruptions of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t. When he came the fir&s;t time to Bo&s;ton, the venerable Dr. Coleman, (with whom I had a &s;mall acquaintance) conde&s;cended to write to me, "That the wonderful man was come, and they had had a week of Sabbaths; that his zeal for Chri&s;t was ex|traordinary; and yet he recommended him&s;elf to his many thou&s;and hearers, by his engagedne&s;s for holi|ne&s;s and &s;ouls." I &s;oon had opportunity to ob&s;erve that wherever he flew, like a flame of fire, his mini&s;|try gave a general alarm to all &s;orts of people, though before, they had, for a long time, been amazingly
<PB N="270" REF="013298_0270_0F904E31A9B5A490">
&s;unk down into dead formality. It was then a time in New-England, that real Chri&s;tians generally had &s;lackened their zeal for Chri&s;t, and fallen into a re|mi&s;s and carele&s;s frame of &s;pirit: and hypocritical profe&s;&s;ors were &s;unk into a deep &s;leep of carnal &s;ecu|rity. Mini&s;ters and their congregations, &s;eemed to be at ea&s;e. But his preaching appeared to be from the heart, though too many, who &s;pake the &s;ame things, preached as if it were indifferent, whether they were received or rejected. We are convinced that he be|lieved the me&s;&s;age he brought us, to be of the la&s;t im|portance. Neverthele&s;s, as &s;oon as there was time for reflection, the enemies of Chri&s;t began to cavil, and hold up &s;ome of his &s;allies, as if they were un|pardonable faults. By &s;uch means he met with a &s;torm as tempe&s;tuous as the troubled &s;ea, that ca&s;ts up mire and dirt. Some of every &s;tation were too fond of their old way of formality, to part with it, for &s;uch a de|&s;pi&s;ed cau&s;e as living religion. But the Spirit of Chri&s;t &s;et home the me&s;&s;age of the Lord upon the con|&s;ciences of &s;ome, and &s;hook them off from their fal&s;e hopes: but many began to find fault, and &s;ome to write again&s;t his evangelizing through the country, while others threatened fire-brands, arrows, and death. Yet God gave room for his inten&s;e zeal to operate, and &s;it objects appeared, wherever he went, to engage him in preaching Chri&s;t, and him crucified.</P>
<P>"In his repeated vi&s;its to America, when his &s;er|vices had almo&s;t exhau&s;ted his animal &s;pirits, and his friends were ready to cry, Spare thy&s;elf, his hope of &s;erving Chri&s;t, and winning &s;ouls to him, animated and engaged him to run almo&s;t any ri&s;que. Neither did he ever cro&s;s the Atlantic on an itinerating vi&s;ita|tion, without vi&s;iting his numerous brethren here, to &s;ee how religion pro&s;pered among them: and we know that his labours have been unwearied among us, and to the applau&s;e of all his hearers; and, through the infinite mercy of God, his labours have &s;ometimes been crowned with great &s;ucce&s;s, in the conver&s;ion
<PB N="271" REF="013298_0271_0F904E3272FBF8B0">
of &s;inners, and the edification of &s;aints. And though he often returned from the pulpit very feeble after public preaching, yet his engaging &s;weetne&s;s of con|ver&s;ation, changed the &s;u&s;picions of many, into pa&s;|&s;ionate love and friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>"In many things his example is worthy of imita|tion; and, if in any thing he exceeded, or came &s;hort, his integrity, zeal for God, and love to Chri&s;t and his Go&s;pel, rendered him, in exten&s;ive u&s;efulne&s;s, more than equal to any of his brethren. In preaching here, and through mo&s;t parts of America, he has been in labours more abundant, approving him&s;elf a Mi|ni&s;ter of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in watchings, in fa&s;tings, by purene&s;s, by the Holy Gho&s;t, by love unfeigned; as &s;orrowful, yet always rejoicing; as having nothing, yet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing all things. And God that comforted tho&s;e that are ca&s;t down, has often comforted us by his coming; and not by his coming only, but by the con&s;olation wherewith he was comforted in us, &s;o that we could rejoice the more.</P>
<P>"His popularity exceeded all that ever I knew; and, though the a&s;thma was &s;ometimes an ob&s;truction to him, his delivery and entertaining method was &s;o inviting to the la&s;t, that it would command the atten|tion of the va&s;t multitudes of his hearers. An appre|hen&s;ion of his concern to &s;erve the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and do good to the &s;ouls of men, drew many thou&s;ands after him, who never embraced the doctrines he taught. He had &s;omething peculiar in his manner, expre&s;&s;ive of &s;incerity in all he delivered, that it con&s;trained the mo&s;t abandoned to think, he believed what he &s;aid was not only true, but of the la&s;t importance to &s;ouls; and by adapted texts adduced, and in&s;tances of the grace of God related agreeable thereto, he often &s;urpri&s;ed his mo&s;t judicious hearers.</P>
<P>"His labours extended not only to New-England, and many other colonies in Briti&s;h America, but were eminent and more abundant in Great-Britain. Many
<PB N="272" REF="013298_0272_0F904E3335DB27B8">
thou&s;ands at his Chapel and Tabernacle in London, and in other places, were witne&s;&s;es that he faithfully endeavour|ed to re&s;tore the doctrines of the Reformation, and the pu|rity of the church to its primitive glory. Some among the learned, &s;ome of the mighty and noble have been called, by his mini&s;try, to te&s;tify for the Go&s;pel of the grace of God. The force of his rea&s;onings again&s;t corrupt principles, and the ea&s;y method he had in expo&s;ing the danger of them, have a&s;toni&s;hed the mo&s;t that heard him, in all places where he preached. How did he lament and with&s;tand the modern, un&s;criptural notions of religion and &s;alvation, that were palmed upon the churches of every denomination! The af|fecting change from primitive purity to fatal here&s;y, together with the &s;ad effects of it in mere formality and open wickedne&s;s, would often make him cry, as the Prophet did in another ca&s;e, "How is the gold become dim, and the mo&s;t fine gold changed! How hath the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud, in his anger, and ca&s;t down from heaven to earth the beauty of I&s;rael"</P>
<P>"It is no wonder that this man of God &s;hould meet with enemies, and with great oppo&s;ition to his mini&s;|try; for hell trembled before him. It is no more than may be always expected of the devil, that he &s;hould &s;tir up his &s;ervants, to load the mo&s;t eminent Mini&s;|ters of Chri&s;t with calumny, and mo&s;t impudent lies; and repre&s;ent them as the filth and off-&s;couring of all things. All this may be, and often has been done, under a pretence of great concern for the honour of Chri&s;t, and the pre&s;ervation of Go&s;pel-order. When &s;atan's kingdom totters and begins to fall, he can find men enough to cry, The Church is in danger; and that, he knows, is &s;ufficient with m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ny, to hide his cloven foot, and make him appear as an angel of light.</P>
<P>"Through a variety of &s;uch labours and trials, our worthy friend, and exten&s;ively u&s;eful &s;ervant of Chri&s;t, Mr. Whitefield, pa&s;&s;ed, both in England and Ame|ca: but the Lord was his &s;un to guide and animate

him, and his &s;hield to defend and help him unto the end: neither did he count his own life dear, &s;o that he might fini&s;h his cour&s;e with joy, and the mini&s;try that he had received of the Lord Je&s;us, to te&s;tify the Go&s;pel of the grace of God. The la&s;t &s;ermon that he preached, though under the di&s;advantage of a &s;tage in the open air, was delivered with &s;uch clear|ne&s;s, pathos, and eloquence, as to plea&s;e and &s;urprize the &s;urrounding thou&s;ands. And as he had been con|firmed by the grace of God, many years before, and had been waiting and hoping for his la&s;t change, he then declared, that he hoped it was the la&s;t time he &s;hould ever preach. Doubtle&s;s, he then had &s;uch clear views of the ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of open vi&s;ion, and the com|complete fruition of God in Chri&s;t, that he felt the plea&s;ures of heaven in his raptured &s;oul, which made his countenance &s;hine like the unclouded &s;un."</P>
<P>The next &s;ermon was preached by Dr. Pemberton of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The following lines are part of a poem on Mr. Whitefield, which is publi&s;hed along with this &s;er|mon, written by a Negro &s;ervant-girl of 17 years of age; and who has been but nine years from Africa, belonging to Mr. J.

and employed to do uncommon &s;ervice for God's church upon earth, it would be criminal ingratitude to &s;uffer them to drop into the du&s;t without the mo&s;t re&s;pectful notice.
<Q>The memory of the ju&s;t is ble&s;|&s;ed!</Q>
Po&s;terity will view Mr. Whitefield in many re&s;pects, as one of the mo&s;t extraordinary characters of the pre&s;ent age. His zealous, ince&s;&s;ant, and &s;uc|ce&s;sful labours, in Europe and America, are without a parallel.</P>
<P>"Devoted early to God, he took orders as &s;oon as the con&s;titution of the e&s;tabli&s;hed Church in England allowed. His fir&s;t appearance in the work of the mi|ni&s;try was attended with &s;urpri&s;ing &s;ucce&s;s. The larg|e&s;t churches in London were not able to contain the numbers that perpetually flocked to hear his awaken|ing di&s;cour&s;es. The crowds daily increa&s;ed. He was &s;oon forced into the fields, followed by multitudes, who hung with &s;ilent attention upon his lips, and
<PB N="275" REF="013298_0275_0F8FFA814F164248">
with avidity received the word of life. The Spirit of God, in uncommon mea&s;ure, de&s;cended upon the hearers. The &s;ecure were awakened to a &s;alutary fear of divine wrath; and inquiring minds were directed to Je&s;us, the only Saviour of a revolted world. The vicious were vi&s;ibly reclaimed, and tho&s;e who had hitherto re&s;ted in a form of godline&s;s, were made ac|quainted with the power of a divine life. The peo|ple of God were refre&s;hed with the con&s;olation of the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit, and rejoiced to &s;ee their exalted Ma&s;|ter, going on from conquering to conquer; and &s;in|ners of all orders and characters, bowing to the &s;cep|ter of a crucified Saviour.</P>
<P>"His zeal could not be confined within the Briti&s;h i&s;lands. His ardent de&s;ire for the welfare of immortal &s;ouls, conveyed him to the di&s;tant &s;hores of America. We beheld a new &s;tar ari&s;e in the hemi&s;phere of the&s;e we&s;tern churches; and its &s;alutary influences were dif|fu&s;ed through a great part of the Briti&s;h &s;ettlements in the&s;e remote regions. We heard with plea&s;ure, from a Divine of the Epi&s;copal communion, tho&s;e great doc|trines of the Go&s;pel, which our venerable ance&s;tors brought with them from their native country. With a &s;oul elevated, above a fond attachment to forms and ceremonies, he inculcated that pure and unadulterat|ed religion, for the pre&s;ervation of which our fathers bani&s;hed them&s;elves into an uncultivated de&s;ert. In his repeated progre&s;&s;es through the Colonies, he was favoured with the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s which attended him on the other &s;ide of the Atlantic. He preached from day to day in thronged a&s;&s;emblies; yet his hearers never di&s;covered the lea&s;t wearine&s;s, but always followed him with increa&s;ing ardour. When in the pulpit, eve|ry eye was fixed upon his expre&s;&s;ive countenance; every ear was charmed with his melodious voice, all &s;orts of per&s;ons were captivated with the propriety and beauty of his addre&s;s.</P>
<P>"But it is not the fine &s;peaker, the accompli&s;hed orator, that we are to celebrate from the &s;acred de&s;k:

the&s;e engaging qualities, if not &s;anctified by divine grace, and con&s;ecrated to the &s;ervice of heaven, are as the &s;ounding bra&s;s, and the tinkling cymbal. When mi&s;improved, in&s;tead of conveying happine&s;s to man|kind, they render us more illu&s;triou&s;ly mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>"The gifts of nature, the acqui&s;itions of art, which adorned the character of Mr. Whitefield, were devoted to the honour of God, and the enlargement of the kingdom of our divine Redeemer. While he preached the Go&s;pel, the Holy Gho&s;t was &s;ent down to apply it to the con&s;ciences of the hearers; the eyes of the blind were opened, to behold the glories of the compa&s;&s;ionate Saviour; the ears of the deaf were un|&s;topped, to attend to the invitations of incarnate love; the dead were animated with a divine principle of life; many in all parts of the land, were turned from darkne&s;s to light, and from the power of &s;atan unto God. The&s;e doctrines which we had been in&s;tructed in from our infancy by our faithful Pa&s;tors, &s;eemed to acquire new force, and were attended with uncom|mon &s;ucce&s;s when delivered by him. His di&s;cour&s;es were not trifling &s;peculations, but contained the mo&s;t intere&s;ting truths; they were not an empty play of wit, but &s;olemn addre&s;&s;es to the hearts of men.</P>
<P>"To convince &s;inners that they were by nature children of wrath; by practice, tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors of the divine law; and in con&s;equence of this, expo&s;ed to the vengeance of offended heaven; to di&s;play the tran&s;cendent excellency of a Saviour, and per&s;uade awakened minds to confide in his merits and righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, as the only hope of a guilty world; to im|pre&s;s upon the profe&s;&s;ors of the Go&s;pel the nece&s;&s;ity, not only of an outward reformation, but an internal change, by the powerful influences of the Spirit; to lead the faithful to a zealous practice of the various duties of the Chri&s;tian life, that they may evidence the &s;incerity of their faith, and adorn the doctrine of God their Saviour; the&s;e were the reigning &s;ubjects of his pulpit di&s;cour&s;es.</P>

<P>"He was no contracted bigot, but embraced chri&s;ti|ans of every denomination in the arms of his charity, and acknowledged them to be children of the &s;ame Father, &s;ervants of the &s;ame Ma&s;ter, heirs of the &s;ame undefiled inheritance.</P>
<P>"That I am not complimenting the dead, but &s;peaking the words of truth and &s;oberne&s;s, I am per|&s;uaded I have many witne&s;&s;es in this a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>"He was always received by multitudes with plea&s;ure, when he favoured the&s;e parts with his la|bours; but he never had a more obliging reception than in his la&s;t vi&s;it. Men of the fir&s;t di&s;tinction in the province, not only attended his mini&s;try, but gave him the highe&s;t marks of their re&s;pect. With what faith|fulne&s;s did he declare unto us the whole coun&s;el of God? With what &s;olemnity did he reprove us for our increa&s;ing degeneracy? With what zeal did he ex|hort us, to remember from whence we were fallen, and repent and do our fir&s;t works, le&s;t God &s;hould come and remove our candle&s;tick out of its place?</P>
<P>"Animated with a Godlike de&s;ign of promoting the temporal and &s;piritual happine&s;s of mankind, after the example of his Divine Ma&s;ter, he went about do|ing good. In this he per&s;evered with unremitting ar|dour and a&s;&s;iduity, till death removed him to that re&s;t which remains for the people of God. Perhaps no man, &s;ince the apo&s;tolic age, preached oftner or with greater &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>"If we view his private character, he will appear in a mo&s;t amiable point of light. The polite Gen|tleman; the faithful friend; the engaging compa|nion; above all, the &s;incere Chri&s;tian, were vi&s;ible in the whole of his deportment.</P>
<P>"With large opportunities of accumulating wealth, he never di&s;covered the lea&s;t tincture of avarice. What he received from the kindne&s;s of his friends, he ge|nerou&s;ly

employed in offices of piety and charity. His benevolent mind was perpetually forming plans of exten&s;ive u&s;efulne&s;s. The Orphan-hou&s;e, which ma|ny years ago he erected in Georgia, and the College he was founding in that province at the time of his death, will be la&s;ting monuments of his care, that re|ligion and learning might be propagated to future ge|nerations.</P>
<P>"I have not, my brethren, drawn an imaginary portrait, but de&s;cribed a character exhibited in real life. I have not mentioned his natural abilities, which were va&s;tly above the common &s;tandard. I con&s;ider him principally in the light of a Chri&s;tian, and a Mi|ni&s;ter of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in which he &s;hone with a pecu|liar lu&s;tre, as a &s;tar of the fir&s;t magnitude.</P>
<P>"After all, I am not repre&s;enting a perfect man; there are &s;pots in the mo&s;t &s;hining characters upon earth. But this may be &s;aid of Mr. Whitefield with ju&s;tice, that after the mo&s;t public appearances for above thirty years, and the mo&s;t critical examination of his conduct, no other blemi&s;h could be fixed upon him, than what aro&s;e from the common frailties of human nature, and the peculiar circum&s;tances which attend|ed his fir&s;t entrance into public life.</P>
<P>"The imprudencies of unexperienced youth, he frequently acknowledged from the pulpit with a frank|ne&s;s which will for ever do honour to his memory. He took care to prevent any bad con&s;equences that might flow from his unguarded cen&s;ures in the early days of his mini&s;try. The longer he lived, the more he evidently increa&s;ed in purity of doctrine, in hu|mility, meekne&s;s, prudence, patience, and the other amiable virtues of the chri&s;tian life."</P>
<P>Another Funeral Sermon on Mr. Whitefield was preached by Mr. Ellington, at Savannah in Georgia, Nov. 11, 1770, upon Heb. xi. 26. "E&s;teeming the reproach of Chri&s;t greater riches than the trea&s;ures of Egypt: for he had re&s;pect unto the recompence

<P>The &s;ame public marks of regard were &s;hewn at one of the churches in Philadelphia, of which Mr. Sprout is pa&s;tor, which by de&s;ire of the &s;e&s;&s;ion and committee, was put into mourning.

<P>"The receiving the melancholy news of the much lamented death of a particular friend to this province, a per&s;on who was once Mini&s;ter of this church, is the rea&s;on of this di&s;cour&s;e; and my choice of this &s;ubject before us, is to pay my grateful re&s;pect to the memory of this well-known able Mini&s;ter of the New Te&s;tament, and faithful &s;ervant of the mo&s;t high God, the Rev. George Whitefield; who&s;e life was ju&s;t|ly e&s;teemed, and who&s;e death will be greatly regret|ted, by the &s;incerely religious part of mankind of all denominations, as long as there is one remaining on earth, who knew him, to recollect the fervor of &s;pirit, and holy zeal with which he &s;pake, when preaching the everla&s;ting Go&s;pel; and every other part of his di&s;intere&s;ted conduct, con&s;i&s;tent with the mini&s;terial character in life and conver&s;ation. Mr. Whitefield's works prai&s;e him loud enough; I am not able to &s;ay any thing that can add greater lu&s;tre to them. May every one that mini&s;ters in holy things, and all who partake of their mini&s;trations, have equal right to the characteri&s;tic in the text as he had.</P>
<P>"It is the ruling opinion of many, that the offence of the cro&s;s is long &s;ince cea&s;ed, and that whatever evil treatment &s;ome of a &s;ingular turn may meet with, it is only the fruit of their own doings, and the re|ward of their own work, whereby they rai&s;e the re&s;ent|ment of mankind again&s;t them for uncharitable &s;lan|der, and &s;piritual abu&s;e. But whoever knoweth any thing of the Go&s;pel, and hath experienced it to be

the power of God unto &s;alvation, knoweth this is the language of per&s;ons who are unacquainted with the depravity of their nature, and through the degeneracy of their hearts, are unwilling to be di&s;turbed; there|fore are &s;aying to the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, "Prophecy unto us &s;mooth things." But the Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel are to be &s;ons of thunder, and &s;o to utter their voice, and conduct their lives, as to prove the nature of their work.</P>
<P>"Our dear and reverend friend was highly honour|ed for many years, in being an happy in&s;trument to do this &s;ucce&s;sfully. With what a holy zeal he pro|ceeded, long before he was publicly ordained to the &s;acred office, has been long atte&s;ted; and no per&s;on has been able to contradict the te&s;timony. No &s;ooner did he appear in the work of the &s;anctuary, but he &s;oon convinced his numerous auditories, that his Al|mighty Lord, who had given him the commi&s;&s;ion, had by his grace wrought him for the &s;elf-&s;ame thing; and through the Holy Spirit, attending his endea|vours, made him a workman that needed not to be a&s;hamed. One would think his great &s;ucce&s;s in his public labours, the frequent opportunities he embraced of doing good, by the relief of people in di&s;tre&s;&s;ing circum&s;tances, every occa&s;ion he took to u&s;e his influ|ence for the good of mankind, and the whole of his behaviour through a life of fifty-&s;ix years, being (&s;o far as the frailty of our pre&s;ent &s;tate will admit) un|blameable and unreproveable, &s;hould have exempted him from contempt and reproach. But quite the contrary, there was &s;o near a re&s;emblance with his ble&s;&s;ed Ma&s;ter, that obliged him to bear his reproach. He has &s;uffered with him on earth, and he is now glorified with him in heaven. He has laboured a|bundantly, and he has been as liberally reproached and maligned from every quarter. Clergy and laity have whet their tongues like a &s;word again&s;t him, and bent their bows to &s;hoot their arrows; but the Lord, among&s;t all, has known and approved his righteous &s;er|vant.
<PB N="281" REF="013298_0281_0F904E3AB1EFDBF8">
Though it is well known he has had oppor|tunity long &s;ince to enjoy epi&s;copal emolument, yet, in his opinion (and it will be found he judged like a wi&s;e man in the end) &s;inners through his in&s;trumen|tality, being turned unto the Lord, and becoming his joy, and crown of rejoicing, in the day of our Lord Je&s;us, was e&s;teemed a greater honour than any this world could afford him. His longing de&s;ire for the &s;alvation of immortal &s;ouls, would not admit of his being confined within the di&s;trict of any walls; though it mu&s;t be ackowledged, he never thought of com|mencing field-preacher, till his invidious enemies re|fu&s;ed him church-pulpits, with indignation of &s;pirit unbecoming the lowe&s;t and vulgar cla&s;s of mankind, much le&s;s men profe&s;&s;ing them&s;elves preachers of god|line&s;s. Though he has, throughout the whole cour&s;e of his mini&s;try, given &s;ufficient proof of his inviolable attachment to our happy e&s;tabli&s;hment, he was de|&s;irous to countenance the image of Chri&s;t wherever he &s;aw it, well knowing, that political in&s;titutions in any nation whatever, &s;hould not de&s;troy the ble&s;&s;ed union, or prevent the communion which ought to &s;ub&s;i&s;t throughout the Holy Catholic Church, between real and &s;incere chri&s;tians of all denominations. Some people may retain &s;uch a veneration for apo&s;tolic phra&s;es as to &s;uppo&s;e they ought not to be applied to other per&s;ons; &s;orry am I to ob&s;erve, that few de&s;erve the application of them. But of Mr. Whitefield we may &s;ay with the &s;tricte&s;t truth, in journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils of his own countrymen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderne&s;s, in perils in the &s;ea, in perils among fal&s;e brethren, in wearine&s;s and painfulne&s;s, he hath ap|proved him&s;elf a Mini&s;ter of God. All who knew and were acquainted with him, &s;oon di&s;covered in him every ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k of good &s;en&s;e and good manners; his company and conversation was &s;o enlivening and en|tertaining, and at the &s;ame time &s;o in&s;tructive and edi|fying, that no per&s;on with the lea&s;t degree of common
<PB N="282" REF="013298_0282_0F904E3B6B75EA60">
&s;en&s;e, could behave improperly in his pre&s;ence. In him met (which do not often meet in one per&s;on) the fini&s;hed and complete Gentleman, and the real and true Chri&s;tian. Why then did he take plea&s;ure in re|proaches, and &s;ubmit to the taunts and in&s;ults both of the vulgar and politer part of mankind? He had re|&s;pect to the recompence of reward. Though the be|liever's work will never entitle him to a reward of debt, yet the reward of grace will always excite a holy de&s;ire to render &s;omething unto the Lord: What would&s;t thou have me do? is the ince&s;&s;ant inquiry of that &s;oul, who by the merits of the Redeemer's death, and the vir|tue of his precious blood, is redeemed from &s;in, and made a partaker of the inheritance incorruptible, un|defiled, and that fadeth not away. Faith operates by good works: and let all the men of the world &s;ay to the contrary, or to put ever &s;o ba&s;e a con&s;truction up|on our doctrine, it will evidence it&s;elf by the&s;e good fruits. It was from the&s;e principles that Mr. White|field acted, and they were productive of the de&s;ired effects; not only in alms giving, this was but a &s;mall matter, when compared with the happier and more important attempt which he made for the good of mankind, at the hazard of his life, and the expence of an unblemi&s;hed character. How he has preached with &s;howers of &s;tones, and many other in&s;truments of malice and revenge about his ears, many of his &s;urvi|ving friends can witne&s;s; but having the &s;alvation of &s;inners at heart, and a great de&s;ire to re&s;cue them from the power of eternal death; he re&s;olved to &s;pend and be &s;pent for the &s;ervice of precious and immortal &s;ouls; and &s;pared no pains, and refu&s;ed no labour, &s;o that he might but admini&s;ter to their real and eternal good: And glory be to our good God, he hath per&s;evered and endured to the end of his life, having re&s;pect un|to the recompence of the reward. Surely nothing el&s;e could &s;upport him under &s;uch a weight of care, and enable him, amid&s;t it all, for &s;o many years, to bear it with &s;o much chearfulne&s;s. The worthy in|habitants

of this Province do not want my atte&s;tation, either to the lo&s;s the province has &s;u&s;tained, or to the de&s;ire he has had for its pro&s;perity. His indefatigable endeavours to promote it, and the many fervent pray|ers he has night and day offered for it, &s;peak loud enough. Happy omens we would hope in favour of it, both as to its temporal increa&s;e, and &s;piritual pro&s;pe|rity. May God rai&s;e up &s;ome u&s;eful men to &s;upply his place, and carry on unto perfection what he hath &s;o di&s;intere&s;tedly begun, that the in&s;titution he hath founded in this province may be of public utility to the late&s;t po&s;terity! As to his death, little more can be &s;aid of it, than has been communicated to the pub|lic already. He died like a hero in the field of battle; he has been fighting the battles of the Lords of Ho&s;ts upwards of thirty years, again&s;t the world, &s;in, and &s;a|tan; and he hath been a conqueror, he hath fought &s;ucce&s;sfully; many, very many, converted &s;inners are the trophies of his victory: but now his warfare is ac|compli&s;hed, the Captain of his &s;alvation hath granted him a di&s;charge, he is entered into his everla&s;ting re&s;t, and is reaping the benefits of a life &s;incerely dedicated to the &s;ervice of the once crucified, but now exalted Je&s;us. He preached the day before his decea&s;e: tho' his death was &s;udden he was not &s;urprized; the morn|ing of his departure not many hours before his &s;pirit took its flight to the regions of bli&s;s, he prayed to the God of his &s;alvation, and committed his departing &s;oul into his hands, as his faithful Creator and all merci|ful Redeemer. Soon after he &s;aid, I am near my end, then fell a&s;leep; he fainted, and died; not one &s;igh, or groan; the Lord heard his prayer and granted him his reque&s;t, and gave him an ea&s;y di&s;mi&s;&s;ion out of time into eternity: &s;udden death was his de&s;ire, and &s;udden death was to him &s;udden glory. He has fought the good fight; few, if any, &s;ince the Apo&s;tles, hath been more exten&s;ively u&s;eful or laboured more abundantly. Thou&s;ands I believe I may with propriety &s;ay, in England, Scotland, and America, have great rea&s;on to

ble&s;s God for his mini&s;trations; for he hath travelled far and wide proclaiming the glad tidings of &s;alvation, through faith in a crucified Saviour. Adorable Em|manuel, make thou up the lo&s;s of him to thy church and people! Let a double portion of thy Spirit be poured out upon the remaining Mini&s;ters! Let that holy fire which burnt &s;o bright in thy departed &s;ervant, warm each of their hearts!

<P>A number of Funeral Sermons were preached for him in England as well as in America. In one by Mr. D. Edwards, Nov. 11, 1770, upon Heb. xi. 4.
<Q>By it he being dead, yet &s;peaketh,</Q>
we have the fol|lowing character of Mr. Whitefield.</P>
<P N="1">"1. The ardent love he bore to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t was remarkable. This divine principle con|&s;trained him to an unwearied application to the &s;er|vice of the Go&s;pel, and tran&s;ported him at times, in the eyes of &s;ome, beyond the bounds of &s;ober rea&s;on. He was content to be a fool for Chri&s;t's &s;ake; to be de&s;pi&s;ed, &s;o Chri&s;t might be honoured; to be nothing, that Je&s;us might be all in all. He had &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of the incomparable excellence of the per&s;on of Chri&s;t, of his adorable conde&s;cen&s;ion in taking our nature up|on him, and enduring the cur&s;es of the holy law; his compleat &s;uitablene&s;s and &s;ufficiency; as the wi&s;dom, righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;anctification and redemption of his peo|ple, that he could never &s;ay enough of him. He was &s;o convinced of the happy tendency and efficacy of this principle in his own mind, that he made u&s;e of it, and propo&s;ed it to others, in the room of a thou&s;and ar|guments, whenever he would inculcate the mo&s;t unre|&s;erved obedience to the whole will of God, or &s;tir up believers to a holy diligence in adorning the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things; in&s;pired by this prin|ciple, nothing frighted or flattered him from his duty.</P>
<P N="2">"2. Another plea&s;ing ingredient in his character, and a &s;ure evidence of the former, was love to the
<PB N="285" REF="013298_0285_0F904E3DC8FD6058">
&s;ouls of mankind. He rejoiced in their pro&s;perity as one that had found great &s;poil; and with St. Paul was willing to &s;pend and be &s;pent in promoting their happine&s;s. He loved all who loved Je&s;us Chri&s;t in &s;in|cerity, however they might differ in &s;ome circum&s;tan|tials. He embraced all opportunities to expo&s;e the malignant leaven of a party, and to remove prejudices and mi&s;apprehen&s;ions which good people too often entertain of one another, when under the influence of a &s;ectarian humour.</P>
<P N="3">"3. His attachment to the great doctrines of the Go&s;pel was inflexible; having known their worth, and experienced their power in his own heart, he plainly &s;aw, that though they were unacceptable to the carnal heart, yet they bore the plain impre&s;s of the infinite wi&s;dom of God. Tho&s;e important truths, which tend to humble the &s;inner, to exalt Chri&s;t, and pro|mote holine&s;s in heart and life, were his darling &s;ub|jects. He did not di&s;gui&s;e Go&s;pel-truths by &s;ome art|ful &s;weetening, or render them more palatable to men of corrupt minds: he &s;tudied to preach the word in its purity, plainne&s;s and &s;implicity. The warmth of his zeal di&s;gu&s;ted many who make a mighty outcry about candour and charity, and are willing to extend it to every &s;entiment, except the truths in which the Apo&s;tles gloried. It was his love to the truths of God, and the &s;ouls of men, that led him to expo&s;e tho&s;e who plead for the rectitude and excellency of human na|ture; deny the proper Godhead of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, ju&s;|tification by faith in his righteou&s;ne&s;s imputed, or the New-Birth, and the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of the opera|tions of the Holy Gho&s;t. Faith and holine&s;s were ever united together in his &s;y&s;tem, in oppo&s;ition to tho&s;e who pretend to faith without obedience to the law of God as the rule of life. He knew errors in the great truths of the Go&s;pel are not indifferent, but dreadful and fatal; he knew it was not candor and charity to &s;ay that errors in judgment are not hurtful, but the
<PB N="286" REF="013298_0286_0F904E3E66548BB8">
greate&s;t unmercifulne&s;s and cruelty; therefore he of|ten reproved &s;uch &s;harply.</P>
<P>"Although he was &s;o tenacious of the foundation-truths of the Go&s;pel, yet none more candid in things that are not e&s;&s;ential; herein he was full of gentle|ne&s;s and forbearance. In things indifferent he became all things to all men <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As to the difference between e&s;&s;entials and non-e&s;&s;entials in religion, Mr. Edwards refers to the Rev. Mr. Newton's "Review of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;tory, &s;o far as it concerns the progre&s;s, decl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n&s;ions, and revi|vals of Evangelical doctrine and practice."</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="4">"4. To the foregoing particulars in Mr. White|field's character, I may add his zeal. His chri&s;tian zeal was like the light of the &s;un, which did warm, &s;hine and cheri&s;h, but knew not to de&s;troy; full of ge|nerous philanthropy and benevolence, his zeal made him exceeding earne&s;t and importunate in his addre&s;|&s;es to &s;aints and &s;inners. His zeal returned ble&s;&s;ings for cur&s;es, and prayers for ill treatment: it kindled in him a becoming indignation again&s;t the errors, fol|lies, and &s;ins of the times: it led him to weep bitter|ly over tho&s;e who would not be per&s;uaded to fly from the wrath to come: it made him bold and intrepid in the cau&s;e of God, and kept him from that flatne&s;s and deadne&s;s which is too vi&s;ible in &s;ome good Mini&s;ters. In the&s;e things he was an example to Mini&s;ters of every denomination: and, if the limits of my di&s;|cour&s;e would admit, I could mention many things, as to his great charity to the poor, his humility, &amp;c."</P>
<P>On Sunday, Nov. 18, 1770, a Sermon was preach|ed on his death at the Chapel in Tottenham-Court-Road, and at the Tabernacle near Moorfields, by the Rev. Mr. John We&s;ley. The text was, Num. xxiii. 10.
<Q>Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my la&s;t end be like his.</Q>
And in the &s;ermon, after giving &s;ome particulars of his life and death, Mr. We&s;ley &s;ays,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="287" REF="013298_0287_0F8FFA83015B7538">"1. We are next to take &s;ome view of his character, A little &s;ketch of this was &s;oon after his death, pub|li&s;hed in the Bo&s;ton Gazette: an extract of which is &s;ubjoined: 'Little can be &s;aid of him, but what eve|ry friend to vital chri&s;tianity, who has &s;at under his mini&s;try, will atte&s;t. In his public labours he has for many years a&s;toni&s;hed the world with his eloquence and devotion. With what divine pathos did he per|&s;uade the impenitent &s;inner to embrace the practice of piety and virtue: filled with the &s;pirit of grace, he &s;poke from the heart, and with a fervency of zeal, perhaps unequalled, &s;ince the days of the Apo&s;tles, adorned the truths he delivered with the mo&s;t grace|ful charms of rhetoric and oratory. From the pulpit he was unrivalled in the command of an ever crowd|ed auditory. Nor was he le&s;s agreeable and in&s;tructive in his private conver&s;ation: happy in a remarkable ea&s;e of addre&s;s, willing to communicate, &s;tudious to edify; may the ri&s;ing generation catch a &s;park of that flame which &s;hone with &s;uch di&s;tingui&s;hed lu&s;tre in the &s;pirit and practice of this faithful &s;ervant of the mo&s;t high God.'</P>
<P N="2">"2. A more particular and equally ju&s;t character of him, has appeared in one of the Engli&s;h papers <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">London Chronicle, November 8, 1770.</NOTE>. It may not be di&s;agreeable to you to add the &s;ub&s;tance of this likewi&s;e: 'The character of this truly pious per|&s;on, mu&s;t be deeply impre&s;t on the heart of every friend to vital religion. In &s;pite of a tender and deli|cate con&s;titution, he continued to the la&s;t day of his life, preaching with a frequency and a fervour that &s;eemed to exceed the natural &s;trength of the mo&s;t ro|bu&s;t. Being called to the exerci&s;e of his function at an age, when mo&s;t young men are only beginning to qua|lify them&s;elves for it, he had not time to make a very con&s;iderable progre&s;s in the learned languages: but this defect was amply &s;upplied by a lively and fertile genius, by fervent zeal, and by a forcible and mo&s;t per&s;ua&s;ive delivery. And though in the pulpit he
<PB N="288" REF="013298_0288_0F904E4219F12CA0">
often found it needful, by the terrors of the Lord, to per&s;uade men, he had nothing gloomy in his nature, being &s;ingularly chearful, as well as charitable and ten|der hearted. He was as ready to relieve the bodily as the &s;piritual nece&s;&s;ities of tho&s;e that applied to him. It ought al&s;o to be ob&s;erved, that he con&s;tantly en|forced upon his audience every moral duty, particu|larly indu&s;try in their &s;everal callings, and obedience to their &s;uperiors. He endeavoured by the mo&s;t extra|ordinary efforts of preaching in different places, and even in the open fields, to rou&s;e the lower cla&s;s of people from the la&s;t degree of inattention and ignorance, to a &s;en&s;e of religion. For this and his other labours, the name of George Whitefield will long be remembered with e&s;teem and veneration.'</P>
<P N="3">"3. That both the&s;e accounts are ju&s;t and impar|tial, will readily be allowed; that is, as far as they go: but they go little farther than the out&s;ides of his cha|racter: they &s;hew you the preacher, but not the man, the chri&s;tian, the &s;aint of God. May I be permitted to add a little on this head, from a per&s;onal know|ledge of near forty years? Indeed, I am thoroughly &s;en&s;ible how difficult it is to &s;peak on &s;o delicate a &s;ub|ject; what prudence is required to avoid both extremes, to &s;ay neither too little, nor too much? Nay, I know it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;peak at all, to &s;ay either le&s;s or more, without incurring from &s;ome the former, from others the latter cen&s;ure. Some will &s;eriou&s;ly think that too little is &s;aid; and others, that it is too much: but without attending to this, I will &s;peak ju&s;t what I know, before Him to whom we are all to give an account.</P>
<P N="4">"4. Mention has already been made of his unpa|ralleled zeal, his indefatigable activity, his tender-heart|edne&s;s to the afflicted, and charitablene&s;s toward the poor. But &s;hould we not likewi&s;e mention his deep gratitude to all whom God had u&s;ed as in&s;truments of good to him? Of whom he did not cea&s;e to &s;peak in the mo&s;t re&s;pectful manner, even to his dying day. Should we not mention that he had an heart &s;u&s;cepti|tible
<PB N="289" REF="013298_0289_0F8FFA838A809D28">
of the mo&s;t generous and the mo&s;t tender friend|&s;hip? I have frequently thought, that this, of all others, was the di&s;tingui&s;hing part of his character. How few have we known of &s;o kind a temper, of &s;uch large and flowing affections. Was it not principally by this, that the hearts of others were &s;o &s;trangely drawn and knit to him? Can any thing but love beget love? This &s;hone in his very countenance, and continually breathed in all his words, whether in public or private. Was it not this, which, quick and penetrating as lightning, flew from heart to heart? Which gave that life to his &s;er|mons, his conver&s;ations, his letters? Ye are witne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P N="5">"5. But away with the vile mi&s;con&s;truction of men of corrupt minds, who know of no love, but what is earthly and &s;en&s;ual. Be it remembered, at the &s;ame time, that he was endued with the mo&s;t nice and unblemi&s;h|ed mode&s;ty. His office called him to conver&s;e very fre|quently and largely with women as well as men, and tho&s;e of every age and condition. But his whole beha|viour toward them, was a practical comment on that advice of St. Paul to Timothy, "Intreat the elder wo|men as mothers, the younger as &s;i&s;ters, with all purity."</P>
<P N="6">"6. Mean time, how &s;uitable to the friendline&s;s of his &s;pirit, was the frankne&s;s and openne&s;s of his con|ver&s;ation? Although it was as far removed from rude|ne&s;s on the one hand, as from guile and di&s;gui&s;e on the other. Was not his frankne&s;s at once a fruit and a proof of his courage and intrepidity? Armed with the&s;e, he feared not the faces of men, but u&s;ed great plainne&s;s of &s;peech to per&s;ons of every rank and condition, high and low, rich and poor; endeavouring only by mani|fe&s;tation of the truth, to commend him&s;elf to every man's con&s;cience in the &s;ight of God.</P>
<P N="7">"7. Neither was he afraid of labour or pain, any more than of what man could do unto him, being equally,
<Q>'Patient in bearing ill and doing well.'</Q>
And this appeared in the &s;teadine&s;s wherewith he pur|&s;ued whatever he undertook, for his Ma&s;ter's &s;ake: witne&s;s one in&s;tance for all, the Orphan-hou&s;e in Geor|gia,
<PB N="290" REF="013298_0290_0F904E43683E3F00">
which he began and perfected, in &s;pite of all di&s;|couragements. Indeed, in whatever concerned him|&s;elf, he was pliant and flexible: in this ca&s;e he was ea|&s;y to be intreated, ea&s;y to be either convinced or per|&s;uaded; but he was immoveable in the things of God, or wherever his con&s;cience was concerned. None could per&s;uade any more than affright him to vary in the lea&s;t point from that integrity, which was in&s;eparable from his whole character, and regulated all his words and actions. Herein he did
<Q><L>'Stand as an iron pillar &s;trong</L>
<L>'And &s;teadfa&s;t as a wall of bra&s;s.'</L></Q></P>
<P N="8">"8. If it be enquired, what was the foundation of this integrity, of his &s;incerity, courage, patience, and every other valuable and amiable quality; it is ea&s;y to give the an&s;wer. It was not the excellency of his natural temper; not the &s;trength of his under&s;tanding: it was not the force of education: no, nor the advice of his friends. It was no other than faith in a bleeding Lord; faith of the operation of God. It was a lively hope of an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away. It was the love of God &s;hed abroad in his heart by the Holy Gho&s;t, which was given unto him, filling his &s;oul with tender, di&s;intere&s;ted love to every child of man. From this &s;ource aro&s;e that tor|rent of eloquence which frequently bore down all be|fore it. From this, that a&s;toni&s;hing force of per&s;ua&s;ion, which the mo&s;t hardened &s;inners could not re&s;i&s;t. This it was, which often made his head as waters, and his eyes a fountain of tears. This it was which enabled him to pour out his &s;oul in prayer, in a manner pecu|liar to him&s;elf, with &s;uch fulne&s;s and ea&s;e united toge|ther, with &s;uch &s;trength and variety both of &s;entiment and expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P N="9">"9. I may clo&s;e this head with ob&s;erving, what an honour it plea&s;ed God to put upon his faithful &s;ervant, by allowing him to declare his everla&s;ting Go&s;pel, in &s;o many various countries, to &s;uch numbers of peo|ple, and with &s;o great an effect, on &s;o many of their pre|cious

</TEXT></Q></NOTE> On the &s;ame day (November 18, 1770) the Rev.
<PB N="292" REF="013298_0292_0F904E452A72E1E0">
Mr. Venn preached at the Counte&s;s of Huntingdon's Chapel at Bath, on I&s;aiah viii. 18. "Behold I, and the children whom the Lord hath given me, are for &s;igns and for wonders in I&s;rael; from the Lord of Ho&s;ts, which dwelleth in Mount Zion." And of Mr. Whitefield he &s;ays, "Though the children of Chri&s;t are all for &s;igns and for wonders in I&s;rael, yet do they differ as one &s;tar differs from another &s;tar in glory. Talents, grace, and zeal, eminently dignify &s;ome; and draw the eyes of men upon them. In the foremo&s;t of this rank, doubt|le&s;s, is the Rev. Mr. Whitefield to be placed; for his doctrine was the doctrine of the Reformers, of the A|po&s;tles, and of Chri&s;t: it was the doctrine of free grace, of God's everla&s;ting love. Through Je&s;us he preached the forgivene&s;s of &s;ins, and per&s;everance in holy living, through his faithfulne&s;s and power engaged to his peo|ple. And the doctrine which he preached he eminent|ly adorned by his zeal, and by his works. For if the greatne&s;s, extent, &s;ucce&s;s, and di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s of a man's labour can give him di&s;tinction among&s;t the chil|dren of Chri&s;t, we are warranted to affirm, that &s;carce any one of his Mini&s;ters &s;ince the Apo&s;tles days, has exceeded; &s;carce any one has equalled Mr. Whitefield.</P>
<P>"What a &s;ign and wonder was this man of God in the greatne&s;s of his labours! One cannot but &s;tand amazed that his mortal frame could for the &s;pace of near thirty years, without interruption, &s;u&s;tain the weight of them. For what is &s;o trying to the human frame, in youth e&s;pecially, as long-continued, frequent and violent &s;training of the lungs? Who, that knows their &s;tructure, would think it po&s;&s;ible, that a per&s;on, little above the age of manhood, &s;hould &s;peak in the compa&s;s of a &s;ingle week (and that for years) in gene|ral, forty hours, and in very many weeks, &s;ixty, and that to thou&s;ands; and after his labour, in&s;tead of taking any re&s;t, &s;hould be offering up prayers, interce&s;|&s;ions, with hymns and &s;piritual &s;ongs, as his manner was in every hou&s;e to which he was invited. The hi&s;|tory of the Church of Chri&s;t affords but very few in|&s;tances
<PB N="293" REF="013298_0293_0F904E45E9A06AF8">
of men thus ince&s;&s;antly employing their whole &s;trength, and as it were, every breath they drew, in the bu&s;ine&s;s of their &s;acred function. And the truth is, that, in point of labour, this extraordinary &s;ervant of God did as much in a few weeks, as mo&s;t of tho&s;e who exert them&s;elves are able to do in the &s;pace of a year. Thus labouring not by fits and &s;tarts, but with con&s;tan|cy and per&s;everance, and ardour unabated, his mortal frame, about nine years &s;ince, began to &s;ink under the weight of &s;o much work. If, with the length and fre|quency of Mr. Whitefield's preaching, we con&s;ider the inten&s;ene&s;s of voice and &s;pirit with which he &s;poke, the greatne&s;s of his labours will appear perfectly a&s;to|ni&s;hing: he knew not how to &s;peak with le&s;s zeal, in his whole manner, than became the &s;ubjects of his di&s;|cour&s;e. The total ruin of the human race by the fall; the complete recovery of believers in Chri&s;t, his dying love, and the un&s;earchable riches of his grace, to be known experimentally in this life, though fully to be di&s;played in the next: and the infatuation of &s;inners, led captive by their lu&s;ts down to the chambers of death: the&s;e grand truths, of more weight than words can paint, fired his whole &s;oul; they tran&s;ported him as much as earthly &s;pirits are tran&s;ported into vehemence, when they contend per&s;onally for their own property; he cried out therefore, as his dear Lord was wont to do, with a voice audible to an amazing di&s;tance: hence in a thou&s;and in&s;tances, where the cau&s;e of God more coolly pleaded, would have been neglected, he gained it a hearing, and carried the day: for the unu&s;ual ear|ne&s;tne&s;s of the &s;peaker rou&s;ed the mo&s;t &s;tupid and le|thargic: it compelled them to feel; the matter mu&s;t be momentous indeed, which the &s;peaker was urging as a man would plead for his own life. Early and of|ten his body &s;uffered for this very violent exertion of his &s;trength: early and often his in&s;ide has bled a con|&s;iderable quantity, and cried out, &s;pare thy&s;elf: but, prodigal of life, in the be&s;t of cau&s;es, he would give him&s;elf no re&s;t; expecting very &s;oon to fini&s;h his cour&s;e,
<PB N="294" REF="013298_0294_0F904E46A83D54A0">
and infinitely de&s;irous to &s;ave the &s;ouls condemned to die; he peri&s;hed. Though this may be blamed as an exce&s;s, it was an exce&s;s far above the reach of a &s;elfi&s;h mind, or an ordinary faith.</P>
<P>"Equal to the greatne&s;s and inten&s;ene&s;s of his la|bours, was their extent. The abilities and grace of mo&s;t teachers, have full employ in a &s;mall di&s;trict, nor have common men talents for more. But when God lights up in the brea&s;t, an apo&s;tolic zeal for his own glory, an apo&s;tolic love for the &s;ouls of men, it &s;eems rea&s;onable to conclude, &s;uch an in&s;trument is de&s;igned for the mo&s;t exten&s;ive u&s;efulne&s;s.</P>
<P>"Accordingly the compa&s;s of Mr. Whitefield's la|bours, exceeds any thing that others can pretend to. Not only in the &s;outh, the we&s;t, and north of England, did he lift up his voice, &s;aying, "Repent, for the king|dom of heaven is come:" but in Wales, in Scotland, in Ireland, and America, from Georgia to Bo&s;ton, va&s;t mul|titudes in each country were witne&s;&s;es of his zeal for the &s;alvation of &s;ouls.</P>
<P>"And to crown all, he was abundantly &s;ucce&s;sful in his va&s;t labours, and di&s;intere&s;ted too. The &s;eals to his mini&s;try, from fir&s;t to la&s;t, I am per&s;uaded, are more than would be credited, could the number be fixed. This is certain, his amazing popularity was only from his u&s;e|fulne&s;s; for he no &s;ooner opened his mouth as a preach|er, than God commanded an extraordinary ble&s;&s;ing up|on his word. The people were &s;o deeply impre&s;&s;ed with the &s;en&s;e of divine things from what he delivered, that, to his own great &s;urprize they followed him from church to church, until the large&s;t churches in London could no longer contain a fourth part of the crowds, which pre&s;&s;ed to hear the word of God from his lips.</P>
<P>"Should any one &s;ay, few in compari&s;on, be&s;ides the low, ignorant, common people were his followers; I would an&s;wer, the &s;ouls of the poor and ignorant, are to the full as precious as tho&s;e of the rich and learned: and the mob have &s;hown the ju&s;te&s;t di&s;cernment, and have received the truth; whil&s;t men of wealth, and
<PB N="295" REF="013298_0295_0F904E47AE26C608">
learning, and education, have trampled it under their feet. Witne&s;s the chief Scribes and Phari&s;ees, who re|jected both the Bapti&s;t and the Saviour, when the com|mon people ju&s;tified God, and gave them both the ho|nour of being &s;ent from him. Indeed in every age, we &s;ee the Scripture fulfilled, not many rich, not many mighty, not many wi&s;e men after the fle&s;h are called; but God hath cho&s;en the poor, rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom.</P>
<P>"However, when the fiercene&s;s of prejudice was worn off, numbers, who at fir&s;t de&s;pi&s;ed him, taught to do &s;o by gro&s;s &s;landers, were happy under his mini&s;try. And this honour was put upon him even to the la&s;t. He had a much larger audience &s;tatedly to hear him, than any man in the whole kingdom, perhaps in all Chri&s;tendom.</P>
<P>"And that this va&s;t multitude of people were ga|thered, ju&s;t as the primitive churches of Chri&s;t, by the truth they heard, and the &s;piritual benefit they received under his word, is evident beyond a rea&s;onable doubt. For if you trace his progre&s;s through the various cities and countries where he preached the Go&s;pel, you will find as the ca&s;e was with St. Paul, &s;o it was with this &s;ervant of Chri&s;t. Many were turned by him from dark|ne&s;s to light, from the power of &s;atan unto God, receiv|ing remi&s;&s;ion of their &s;ins, and an inheritance among tho&s;e that are &s;anctified, through faith in Chri&s;t. En|quire of the effects of his labours, from the only pro|per judges, tho&s;e who live in the religious world, and they will aver, that many within their own knowledge, &s;mall as that circle mu&s;t be, confe&s;s they owe their own &s;elves to this faithful witne&s;s for his Lord. Add to this, that the letters he received of grateful acknowledg|ment from per&s;ons of all ages and conditions in life, for the &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings he had conveyed to them, would fill whole volumes. Nay, it is a well-known fact, that the conver&s;ion of mens' &s;ouls has been the fruit of a &s;ingle &s;ermon from his lips; &s;o eminently was he made of God, a fi&s;her of men. But he was not more &s;ucce&s;sful
<PB N="296" REF="013298_0296_0F904E483AA14ED0">
than he was di&s;intere&s;ted in his labours; for though a va&s;t multitude, (which mu&s;t ever be the ca&s;e with tho&s;e whom God is plea&s;ed remarkably to own) followed him, he had &s;till no ambition to &s;tand as the head of a party. His great object was to exalt Chri&s;t crucified; and when his hearers were brought to the knowledge of &s;alvation, his point was gained, and his &s;oul was &s;a|tisfied. Hence neither in his &s;ermons, nor more private exhortations, did he ca&s;t di&s;paraging reflections upon other preachers of Chri&s;t. No ba&s;e &s;ugge&s;tion dropt from his mouth, as if to differ from him mu&s;t be owing to blindne&s;s in the judgment, or coldne&s;s of the heart for the intere&s;ts of holine&s;s. Truly cordial and catholic in his love for all who appeared to love the Lord Je&s;us in &s;incerity, he never de&s;ired to &s;ee his congregation in|crea&s;ed by tho&s;e who had evangelical pa&s;tors of their own. Further, in proof of his di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, con&s;i|der what he gained by his labours. The &s;courge of the tongue was let loo&s;e upon him, and his name was load|ed with the foule&s;t calumnies; he was often in tumults, and more than once in danger of his life, by the rage of the people; he wore him&s;elf away in the &s;ervice of &s;ouls; and when he died, he died quite exhau&s;ted by much &s;peaking; but in his death, he received an im|mediate an&s;wer to his own prayer, 'That if it were con&s;i&s;tent with the Divine Will, he might fini&s;h that day his Ma&s;ter's work.'</P>
<P>"For &s;uch a life, and &s;uch a death, (though in tears under our great lo&s;s) we mu&s;t yet thank God. And though we are allowed to &s;orrow, becau&s;e we &s;hall ne|ver &s;ee or hear him again, we mu&s;t rejoice that milli|ons have heard him &s;o long, &s;o often, and to &s;uch good effect; that out of this ma&s;s of people, multitudes are gone before him, we doubt not, to hail his entrance in|to the world of glory; and that in every period of life, from childhood to hoary age, many of his children in the Lord are &s;till to follow; all to be his crown of re|joicing: the only effectual, everla&s;ting confutation of his adver&s;aries; that he ran not in vain, nor laboured in vain."</P>
<P><PB N="297" REF="013298_0297_0F904E4987A7A7E0">There were many other &s;ermons preached on occa&s;i|on of Mr. Whitefield's death, in which the de&s;criptions of his character are the &s;ame in &s;ub&s;tance, with tho&s;e already given <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Such as, by the Rev.

For in a vi&s;it to Ireland, he was &s;olicited by the Primate of that kingdom, to accept of &s;ome con&s;iderable church preferment; but declined the offer, becau&s;e he looked upon him&s;elf as called to an itinerant life; and what makes this circum&s;tance the more remarkable, is, that Mr. Whitefield, at that time, had no pro&s;pect what|ever, as to temporals."</P></NOTE>.</P>

quite &s;uitable to his extraordinary manner of life. But it was &s;till more &s;ingular, to have a &s;ermon preached upon his per&s;onal and mini&s;terial character, in his own lifetime, and when he was but twenty-&s;ix years of age. This &s;ermon was preached by the Rev. Mr. Jo&s;iah Smith of Charle&s;town, South-Carolina, and was publi&s;hed at Bo&s;ton, with a recommendatory preface by the Rev. Dr. Colm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n and Mr. Cooper, in the year 1740. Of this it is worth while to make a &s;hort extract, after all that has been &s;aid; that by comparing it with the fu|neral &s;ermons, the reader may &s;ee how con&s;i&s;tent and uniform Mr. Whitefield's conduct was, from that early period of his mini&s;try, till his death.</P>
<P>After &s;peaking of his doctrine concerning Original Sin&mdash;Ju&s;tification by faith alone&mdash;Regeneration&mdash;The inward feelings of the Spirit&mdash;Mr. Smith adds, "As to the manner of his preaching&mdash;With what a flow of words did he &s;peak to us, upon the great concern of our &s;ouls! In what a flaming light did he &s;et out eter|nity before us! How earne&s;tly did he pre&s;s Chri&s;t up|on us! How clo&s;e, &s;trong, and pungent were his appli|cations to the con&s;cience; mingling light and heat; pointing the arrows of the Almighty at the heart of &s;inners, while he poured in the balm on the wounds of the contrite! How bold and courageous did he look? He was no flatterer. He taught the way of God in truth, and regarded not the per&s;ons of men. The polite&s;t and mo&s;t modi&s;h of our vices he &s;truck at, the mo&s;t fa&s;hion|able entertainments; regardle&s;s of every ones pre|&s;ence, but His in who&s;e name he &s;pake.</P>
<P>"As to his per&s;onal character, while he preaches up faith alone in our ju&s;tification before God, he is care|ful to maintain good works. The&s;e things the grace of God teaches us. And how much of this doctrine has he tran&s;cribed into his life! How rich has he been in all good works! What an eminent pattern of piety towards God! How holy and unblameable in all conver&s;ation and godline&s;s! How &s;ea&s;oned, how much to the u&s;e of edifying all his di&s;cour&s;es! How naturally does he turn
<PB N="300" REF="013298_0300_0F8FFA358E7CF430">
them to religion? How much is he given to devotion him&s;elf, and how does he labour to excite it in others!</P>
<P>"He affects no party in religion, nor &s;ets him&s;elf at the head of any. He is not bigotted to the le&s;&s;er rites and forms of religion, while zealous enough in all its e&s;&s;entials. He profe&s;&s;es love to good men of every de|nomination. His heart &s;eems &s;et upon doing good. He goes about his great Ma&s;ter's work with diligence and application, and with &s;uch chearfulne&s;s as would make one in love with a life of religion. He is proof again&s;t reproach and invective. When he is reviled, he revil|e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h not again; but prays heartily for all his enemies.</P>
<P>"He renders to all their due. While zealous for the things of God, is a friend to Cae&s;ar. And for charity, as it con&s;i&s;ts in compa&s;&s;ion and acts of beneficence, we have few men like minded. Had he been under any cri|minal influence of a mercenary temper; had he col|lected monies for him&s;elf in his journeys, under pre|text of doing it for the poor, as he was &s;landerou&s;ly re|ported, he had certainly a fair opportunity to enrich him&s;elf. But we have &s;een; and plain fact cannot be denied; that he ca&s;ts all into the Trea&s;ury, and &s;erves the tables of the poor with it. Strolling and vagabond orphans, without father, and without mother, without pur&s;e, and without friend, he &s;eeks out, picks up, and adopts into his family. He is now building accommo|dations, and laying the be&s;t foundation for their &s;up|port and maintenance." Thus far Mr. J. Smith, who had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing this character of his friend verified in the whole of his future life; and who, in his Funeral Sermon upon him at Charle&s;town, Oct. 28, 1770, has this remarkable expre&s;&s;ion, concerning a vi|&s;it he made to Mr. Whitefield at his Orphan-hou&s;e: "It was a &s;cene that made me think I was in heaven."</P>
<P>By a paper, written with Mr. Whitefield's own hand, of the contents of his imperfect manu&s;cript, frequent|ly quoted in the above account of his life, it appears, that if he had lived to fini&s;h it, the conclu&s;ion would have been, "Reflections upon the whole, containing
<PB N="301" REF="013298_0301_0F8FFA365052AA48">
arguments to prove the divinity of the work; and an&s;wers to objections again&s;t Fleid-preaching&mdash;Lay-preaching&mdash;Irregularities&mdash;And the blemi&s;hes that have attended it."</P>
<P>As he did not live to execute this de&s;ign, the reader is referred to what has been publi&s;hed upon the &s;ubject by the Rev. Me&s;&s;. Jonathan Edwards, Hobby, Shurt|liff, &amp;c. The Rev. Mr. Newton preached a &s;ermon at Olney, Nov. 11, 1770, on John v. 35.
<Q>He was a burning, and a &s;hining light.</Q>
In which he &s;peaks of Mr. Whitefield; an extract of which follows: "Some Mini&s;ters are burning and &s;hining lights in a peculiar and eminent degree. Such a one, I doubt not, was the &s;ervant of God who&s;e death we now lament. I have had &s;ome opportunities of looking over the Hi&s;|tory of the Church in pa&s;t ages, and I am not back|ward to &s;ay, that I have not read or heard of any per|&s;on &s;ince the Apo&s;tle's days, of whom it may more em|phatically be &s;aid, "He was a burning and a &s;hining light," than the late Mr. Whitefield, whether we con&s;i|der the warmth of his zeal, the greatne&s;s of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i|&s;terial talents, or the exten&s;ive u&s;efulne&s;s with which the Lord honoured him. I do not mean to prai&s;e the man, but the Lord who furni&s;hed him, and made him what he was. He was rai&s;ed up to &s;hine in a dark place. The &s;tate of religion, when he fir&s;t appeared in public, was very low, in our e&s;tabli&s;hed church. I &s;peak the truth, though to &s;ome it may be an offen&s;ive truth. The doctrines of Grace, were &s;eldom heard from the pulpit, and the life and power of godline&s;s were little known. Many of the mo&s;t &s;piritual among the Di&s;&s;enters, were mourning under the &s;en&s;e of a great &s;preading declen&s;i|on on their &s;ide&punc; what a change has taken place throughout the land within a little more than thirty years, that is, &s;ince the time when the fir&s;t &s;et of de|&s;pi&s;ed Mini&s;ters came from Oxford! and how much of this change has been owing to God's ble&s;&s;ing on Mr. Whitefield's labours, is well known to many who have lived through this period; and can hardly be denied
<PB N="302" REF="013298_0302_0F8FFA370C0E26B0">
by tho&s;e who are lea&s;t willing to allow it. Fir&s;t, He was a burning light. He had an ardent zeal for God, an enflamed de&s;ire for the &s;alvation of &s;inners. So that no labours could weary him, no difficulties or oppo&s;i|tion di&s;courage him, hardly any limits could confine him; not content with the bounds of a county, or a kingdom, this me&s;&s;enger of good tidings preached the everla&s;ting Go&s;pel in almo&s;t every con&s;iderable place in England, Scotland and Ireland, and throughout the Briti&s;h empire in America, which is an extent of more than a thou&s;and miles. Mo&s;t of the&s;e places he vi&s;ited again and again; nor did he confine his attention to places of note, but in the former part of his mini&s;try, was ready to preach to few, as well as to many, where|ever a door was opened; though in the latter part of his life, his frequent illne&s;s, and the nece&s;&s;ity of his more immediate charge, confined him more at home. In &s;ome of his mo&s;t early excur&s;ions, the good Provi|dence of God led him here, and many, I tru&s;t, were made willing to rejoice in his light, and have rea&s;on to ble&s;s God, that ever they &s;aw and heard him. 2dly, He was a &s;hining light: his zeal was not like wild-fire, but directed by &s;ound principles, and a &s;ound judgment. In this part of his character, I would ob&s;erve, 1&s;t, Tho' he was very young when he came out, the Lord &s;oon gave him a very clear view of the Go&s;pel. In the &s;er|mons he publi&s;hed &s;oon after his fir&s;t appearance, there is the &s;ame evangelical &s;train ob&s;erveable, as in tho&s;e which he preached in his advanced years. Time and ob&s;ervation, what he felt, and what he &s;aw, enlarged his experience, and gave his preaching an increa&s;ing ripene&s;s and &s;avour, as he grew older in the work; but from fir&s;t to la&s;t he preached the &s;ame Go&s;pel, and was determined to know nothing but Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and him crucified. 2dly, His &s;teadine&s;s and per&s;everance in the truth was the more remarkable, con&s;idering the difficulties and &s;nares he was &s;ometimes be&s;et with. But the Lord kept him &s;teady, &s;o that neither the ex|ample,
<PB N="303" REF="013298_0303_0F904DBF39178638">
nor friend&s;hip, nor importunity of tho&s;e he dearly loved, were capable of moving him.</P>
<P N="3">3dly, The Lord gave him a manner of preaching, which was peculiarly his own. He copied from none, and I never met any one who could imitate him with &s;ucce&s;s. They who attempted generally made them&s;elves di&s;agreeble. His familiar addre&s;s, the power of his ac|tion, his marvellous talent in fixing the attention even of the mo&s;t carele&s;s, I need not de&s;cribe to tho&s;e who have heard him, and to tho&s;e who have not, the attempt would be vain. Other Mini&s;ters could, perhaps, preach the Go&s;pel as clearly, and in general &s;ay the &s;ame things; but, I believe, no man living could &s;ay them in his way. Here I always thought him unequalled, and I hardly expect to &s;ee his equal while I live.</P>
<P N="4">"4th, But that which fini&s;hed his character as a &s;hining light, and is now his crown of rejoicing, was the &s;ingular &s;ucce&s;s which the Lord was plea&s;ed to give him in winning &s;ouls; what numbers entered the king|dom of glory before him, and what numbers are now lamenting his lo&s;s, who were awakened by his mini&s;try. It &s;eemed as if he never preached in vain. Perhaps there is hardly a place, in all the exten&s;ive compa&s;s of his labours, where &s;ome may not yet be found who thank|fully acknowledge him as their &s;piritual father. Nor was he an awakening preacher only wherever he came; if he preached but a &s;ingle di&s;cour&s;e, he u&s;ually brought a &s;ea&s;on of refre&s;hment and revival with him, to tho&s;e who had already received the truth. Great as his im|mediate and per&s;onal u&s;efulne&s;s was, his occa&s;ional u&s;e|fulne&s;s (if I may &s;o call it) was perhaps much greater. Many have cau&s;e to be thankful for him, who never &s;aw or heard him. I have already ob&s;erved, that there was a &s;omething peculiar in his manner of preaching, in which no per&s;on of &s;ound judgment would venture to imitate him. But notwith&s;tanding this, he was, in other re&s;pects, a &s;ignal and happy pattern and model <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> preachers. He introduced a way of clo&s;e and lively ap|plication to the con&s;cience, for which I believe many
<PB N="304" REF="013298_0304_0F8FFA37C9B4F470">
of the mo&s;t admired and eminent preachers now living will not be a&s;hamed, or unwilling to acknowledge them&s;elves his debtors."</P>
<P>There was al&s;o a Sermon preached on the occa&s;ion by the Rev. Mr. Samuel Brewer, of Stepney, London, which his mode&s;ty would not permit him to print. And many others of the Mini&s;ters, both of the Church, and among the Di&s;&s;enters in England, in their &s;ermons and prayers upon the news of Mr. Whitefield's death, be|wailed the lo&s;s of &s;o great a man, and &s;o faithful and &s;ucce&s;sful a &s;ervant of Chri&s;t; among the&s;e were the Rev. Mr. Romaine, Mr. Madan, Dr. Gibbons, and Dr. Trotter.</P>
<P>On the 6th of February 1771, the executors having received the probat of Mr. Whitefield's Will, Mr. Keen, who was perfectly acquainted with every parti|cular of his temporal affairs, immediately publi&s;hed it, with the following preamble:</P>
<P>As we make no doubt the numerous friends of the late Rev. Mr. George Whitefield will be glad of an opportunity of &s;eeing a genuine copy of his la&s;t Will and Te&s;tament; his Executors have favoured us with a copy of the &s;ame, tran&s;mitted to them from the Or|phan-hou&s;e in Georgia, and which they have proved in the Prerogative Court of Canterbury. And as it was Mr. Whitefield's con&s;tant declaration he never meant to rai&s;e either a pur&s;e or a party, it is to be re|marked, that almo&s;t the whole money he died po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, came to him within two or three years of his death in the following manner, <HI>viz.</HI> Mrs. Thom&s;on of Tower-Hill, bequeathed him L. 500. By the death of his wife, including a bond of L. 300 he got L. 700. Mr. Whitmore bequeathed him L. 100 and Mr. Win|der L. 100; and it is highly probable, that had he liv|ed to reach Georgia from his late northern tour, he would have much le&s;&s;ened the above &s;ums, by di&s;po|&s;ing of them in the &s;ame noble and di&s;intere&s;ted man|ner that all the public or private &s;ums he has been en|tru&s;ted with, have been.</P>

To all my other chri&s;tian benefactors, and more intimate acquaintance, I leave my mo&s;t hearty thanks and ble&s;&s;ing, a&s;&s;uring them that I am more and more convinced of the un|doubted reality, and infinite importance of the grand Go&s;pel truths which I have from time to time deliver|ed; and am &s;o far from repenting my delivering them in an itinerant way, that had I &s;trength equal to my inclina|tion, I would preach them from pole to pole, not only becau&s;e I have found them to be the power of God to the &s;alvation of my own &s;oul, but becau&s;e I am as much a&s;&s;ured that the Great Head of the Church hath called me by his word, providence and &s;pirit, to act in this way, as that the &s;un &s;hines at noon day. As for my enemies, and misjudging, mi&s;taken friends, I mo&s;t free|ly and heartily forgive them, and can only add, that the la&s;t tremendous day will &s;oon di&s;cover what I have been, what I am, and what I &s;hall be, when time it&s;elf &s;hall be no more; and therefore, from my inmo&s;t &s;oul, I clo&s;e all, by crying, Come, Lord Je&s;us, come quick|ly; even &s;o Lord Je&s;us, Amen and Amen.</P>

<P>Concerning the manner in which Mr. Whitefield's Tabernacle and Chapel are at pre&s;ent &s;upplied, the compiler has received the following information.:</P>
<P>HAVING by his Will left both of his places of wor&s;hip, his hou&s;es, library, and all things appertaining thereto, to two of his executors in &s;urvivor&s;hip, they have been enabled, through the abundant goodne&s;s of God, to carry on the work in the &s;ame manner as in Mr. Whitefield's life-time, without the lea&s;t diminu|tion either of largene&s;s of the congregations, or the vi|&s;ible power of God attending the mini&s;try ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. And as neither of them are Mini&s;ters, but engaged in ex|ten&s;ive bu&s;ine&s;s, it appears the more wonderful, and
<PB N="311" REF="013298_0311_0F904DC80934CFC0">
&s;hews the work to be begun and carried on by the pow|er of God alone; and it is their earne&s;t prayer and &s;tu|dy that it may be tran&s;mitted down, and faithful Mi|ni&s;ters and upright per&s;ons rai&s;ed to carry it on when their heads are laid in the du&s;t. Two of his fellow-labourers were taken off by death, whil&s;t he was la&s;t abroad, viz. the Rev. Mr. Howel Davie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; a Clergy|man, and Mr. Thomas Adams, a layman; and a lit|tle before, Mr. Middleton, all tried and faithful Mini&s;|ters; but the Lord hath wonderfully rai&s;ed up others in their &s;tead. The pre&s;ent Mini&s;ters are chiefly the&s;e, the Rev. Mr. Kin&s;man of Plymouth, the Rev. Mr. Edwards of Leeds, the Rev. Mr. Knight of Hallifax, and the Rev. Mr. A&s;hburner, of Pool in Dort&s;et&s;hire; the&s;e vi&s;it London once, and if wrote for, twice a year. The con&s;tant ones upon the &s;pot are, Mr. Jo&s;s and Mr. Brook&s;banks. The Rev. Mr. De Courcy, and the Rev. Mr. Piercy, and other Clergymen, have often a&s;&s;i&s;ted. Be&s;ides the&s;e, the proprietors have been fa|voured with the occa&s;ional labours of Mr. Rowland Hill, and Mr. Heath of Plymouth: al&s;o of many wor|thy Clergymen and Di&s;&s;enting Mini&s;ters from the coun|try, who e&s;teemed it their privilege to preach to very large, &s;erious, and attentive congregations, who&s;e hearts have been filled with thankfulne&s;s, and at the &s;ame time engaged in prayer for every &s;uch Mini&s;ter; and an unu&s;ual ble&s;&s;ing has commonly attended both &s;owers and reapers; and it is the earne&s;t de&s;ire of the proprietors, that the plea&s;ure of the Lord may thus pro&s;per in their hands. They purpo&s;e, through the ble&s;&s;ing of God, to let the pulpits be open to every di&s;intere&s;ted Mini&s;ter that may occa&s;ionally come to town, of good moral character, &s;ound in the faith, of moderate Calvini&s;tical principles, without di&s;tinction of parties or denominations, who&s;e talents are &s;uitable to preach with life and power to large congregations. And hope for the concurrence of all well-wi&s;hers to the pro&s;perity of Zion.</P>

<P>SINCE this work was fini&s;hed, the following par|ticulars have come to the Editor's knowledge, <HI>viz.</HI> That Mrs. Rachel Wells of Philadelphia, famous in America for her ingenious performances in wax-work, made a w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ge of Mr. Whitefield, as large as life, properly dre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">d, before Mr. Whitefield died: and (from her regard to the memory of that great and good man) &s;oon a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r his death, carried it, at her own expence, to Georgia, (upwards of nine hundred miles) and made a pre&s;ent of it to Bethe&s;da College. The likene&s;s is &s;aid to be &s;o &s;triking, that it a&s;toni&s;hes all who have &s;een it. Her &s;i&s;ter, Mrs. Wright of New-York, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the &s;ame uncommon genius for wax-work, is lately arrived in London, and has brought over with her &s;everal of her performances: among them is a wax image of Mr. Whitefield, dre&s;&s;ed in his own wig, band, &amp;c. &s;o like the original, that all who have &s;een it, have in the &s;tronge&s;t terms expre&s;&s;ed their approba|tion. It is &s;aid &s;he is come over, at the de&s;ire of &s;ome Gentlemen in New-York, to take off &s;ome of the capi|tal characters in England, viz. Lord Chatham, Mrs. Macaulay, Mr. Garrick, &amp;c. and from the &s;pecimen &s;he has given of her abilities in Mr. Whitefield's image, will no doubt meet with encouragement &s;uitable to her merit.</P>
