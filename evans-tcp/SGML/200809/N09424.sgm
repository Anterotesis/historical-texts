<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE materials for the following work were collected more than twenty years ago, and would then have been put to|gether for public u&s;e, had it not been thought un&s;ea&s;onable; as the Colonies were not, at that time, di&s;po&s;ed to attend to the epi&s;copal-di&s;pute: nor would this have been their in|clination at pre&s;ent, had it not been excited in them, more e&s;pecially by the clergy of the church of England, who, not being &s;atisfied with having tran&s;mitted petitions to their &s;uperiors at home, begging their influence in favor of the &s;ettlement of an Epi&s;copate in America, deputi&s;ed one of their number to write "an appeal to the Public," citing object|ors to their impartial tribunal for tryal of the weight of their objections, if any they had to offer, again&s;t the rea&s;onablene&s;s of their re|que&s;t. This conduct of their's has con&s;trained
<PB N="iv" REF="012009_0003_0F8941536DC86DB0">
tho&s;e of a different per&s;ua&s;ion to &s;peak in their own behalf; and the rather, as it was, in a formal manner, given out, that, "if nothing was &s;aid again&s;t an American Epi&s;copate, it would be taken for granted, all parties acqui|e&s;ced, and were &s;atisfied."</P>
<P>IN con&s;equence of this extraordinary chal|lenge, <HI>that</HI> has been &s;aid, which, I believe, the epi&s;copalians will not find them&s;elves ea&s;ily able to an&s;wer. But there is &s;till room for &s;uch a work as that profe&s;&s;es to be, which is emitted herewith: and it was judged by many to be &s;ea&s;onable at this day; more e&s;pecially, as it has been openly and repeatedly declared, 'that it is a <HI>FACT</HI> certainly and univer&s;ally handed down by the Chri&s;tian Fathers, even from the earlie&s;t days, that <HI>GOVERNING</HI> and <HI>ORDAIN|ING AUTHORITY</HI> was exerci&s;ed <HI>ONLY BY BISHOPS OF AN ORDER, IN THE CHURCH, DISTINCT FROM, AND SUPERIOR TO PRESBYTERS.</HI>'</P>
<P>HOW far the above affirmation is agreea|ble to truth, or whether it will at all con&s;i&s;t with it, every man of common under&s;tanding, who will be at the pains to read the &s;ub&s;equent pages, will be able, from what he may &s;ee with his own eyes, to judge. Tho&s;e, mo&s;t certainly,
<PB N="v" REF="012009_0004_0F8941542CF28010">
may be thought well qualified to form a judg|ment in this matter, who are men of capacity and learning, though they have had neither oppor|tunity, nor lei&s;ure, to acquaint them&s;elves with the writings of the antient Fathers. It was principally for the &s;ake of per&s;ons in each of the&s;e kinds, whether epi&s;copalians, or Chri&s;tians of any other denomination, that the pre&s;ent work was engaged in, and made public. And for this rea&s;on it was thought proper to be more particular, than would otherwi&s;e have been ne|ce&s;&s;ary, in giving an account, not only of the&s;e Fathers, but of their writings; di&s;tingui&s;hing between tho&s;e that have been fal&s;ely attribu|ted to them, and tho&s;e that may he e&s;teemed truly genuine; as al&s;o between tho&s;e that are pure, and tho&s;e that have been adulterated with corrupt mixtures. In the doing of this, which has enlarged the work, and increa&s;ed my labour, I pretend to be little more than a collector; though, in&s;tead of tran&s;cribing from others, I have u&s;ed my own words, unle&s;s when I give notice to the contrary: and this I cho&s;e to do, that I might be more conci&s;e, and have it in my power to convey only that to others, which I believe contains the exact truth.</P>
<P>THE pa&s;&s;ages from the Fathers, called apo&s;tolical, that is, the Fathers who may be
<PB N="vi" REF="012009_0005_0F894154EBFC21C0">
&s;uppo&s;ed to have conver&s;ed with one, or more, of the apo&s;tles, I have given in the ver&s;ion of Arch-Bi&s;hop Wake; not &s;o much to &s;ave my|&s;elf the trouble of a tran&s;lation, as to prevent all &s;u&s;picion of too high, or too low, a turn to any modes of expre&s;&s;ion, in order to favor my own &s;en&s;e of the fact in di&s;pute. I &s;hould have been glad, could I have done the like in regard of what is offered from the other Fathers. I am my&s;elf accountable for the tran&s;lation of the extracts from them; in which I have not &s;o much &s;tudied elegance, as an exact repre&s;enta|tion of their real meaning. I can truly &s;ay, I have, to the be&s;t of my capacity, given the <HI>WHOLE</HI> that is contained in the writings of the Fathers, within the time &s;pecified. Sure I am, I have willingly omitted no pa&s;&s;age, or word, that may be found in any of their works; but have been as free to in&s;ert tho&s;e, epi&s;copa|lians would de&s;ire might have a place here, as others they might wi&s;h had been kept out of &s;ight. It is po&s;&s;ible, after all, there may be omi&s;&s;ions, or mi&s;takes, through inattention, for|getfulne&s;s, or &s;ome other cau&s;e more or le&s;s faul|ty; though I am not con&s;cious of any, and be|lieve there are none that are material. If any &s;uch there &s;hould be, I &s;hould e&s;teem it a favor to &s;ee them corrected. As to tho&s;e of &s;mall importance, the learned and judicious, &s;hould they
<PB N="vii" REF="012009_0006_0F89415691138D30">
ob&s;erve any &s;uch, will candidly overlook and excu&s;e them.</P>
<P>HAD there been a &s;ufficiency of Greek types in town, and dexterity to u&s;e them, more of the language in which many pa&s;&s;ages were wrote would have been printed: but this de|fect may be thought pardonable, as I have all along in&s;erted &s;uch original words, though in Engli&s;h letters, as may be thought to be of importance in the pre&s;ent debate. I could ea&s;ily have crowded the margin with references to the books, and particular pages in them, I have had occa&s;ion to con&s;ult; but this, to &s;ave room, and a vain &s;hew of learning, I have omitted: at the &s;ame time, taking care to name my au|thors, and particular places in their writings, in all in&s;tances that have an argumentative connection with any con&s;iderable part of the grand &s;ubject in di&s;pute.</P>
<P>IT is hoped, the following work will not be altogether u&s;ele&s;s. Much indeed has been al|ready, and repeatedly, publi&s;hed relative to the Fathers, and their writings; and nothing more frequently to be met with than quotations from them, in &s;upport of the epi&s;copal cau&s;e, by tho&s;e who have appeared in its defence. But no one, within the compa&s;s of my knowledge, has
<PB N="viii" REF="012009_0007_0F8941572FB15DA8">
collected together, and brought to view, <HI>ALL</HI> that they have &s;aid expre&s;&s;ive of their &s;entiments upon this head. This, if I mi&s;take not, was a work much needed, and may be improved to good purpo&s;e. The truth of the <HI>FACT</HI> in debate may herefrom be brought to a clear and full de|termination.</P>
<P>IF any &s;hould complain of it as a fault, that I have confined my&s;elf within too narrow limits, not going beyond the clo&s;e of the &s;econd century;&mdash; I would briefly &s;ay, when we have pa&s;&s;ed the&s;e bounds we have got into times, in which there was very vi&s;ibly a departure from the purity and &s;implicity of the go&s;pel. The <HI>MAN OF SIN</HI> now began to make his appearance, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A Gentleman of learning beyond the Atlantic, to whom I had mentioned my confinement of the pre&s;ent view of Epi&s;copacy within the two fir&s;t centuries, expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf upon it in the&s;e words, "The third and following centu|ries are de&s;ervedly to be rejected with a kind of pious in|dignation in an enquiry of this nature. For when Con&s;tan|tine had deformed and corrupted chri&s;tianity; and from being "all glorious within," had dre&s;&s;ed up the church of Chri&s;t in robes of external pomp, and made it all gaudy without, and decked and adorned it like the kingdoms of this world; no wonder that its native mode&s;ty &s;oon be|came tainted; that it yielded to the &s;olicitations, and had criminal conver&s;ation with the princes of the earth; and by degrees &s;unk into that MOTHER OF HARLOTS, which it at pre&s;ent &s;hews it&s;elf to be, in almo&s;t every part of the world, where it is pretended to be e&s;tabli&s;hed by their power, and enriched with their wealth."</NOTE> though it
<PB N="ix" REF="012009_0008_0F894157EC8BC730">
was in a gradual way that he attained to that exaltation in dignity and power, as to be "above all that is called god." Be&s;ides, if there are no witne&s;&s;es for the fir&s;t two hundred years, or in&s;ufficient ones only, to certify the truth of the fact in que&s;tion, the great argument in favor of epi&s;copacy, fetched from the <HI>UNIVERSAL CONSENT OF ALL AGES FROM THE BEGIN|NING OF CHRISTIANITY,</HI> mu&s;t inevitably lo&s;e its force. And this is acknowledged by the cele|brated Bi&s;hop Hoadly, who has wrote, as I judge, in the mo&s;t ma&s;terly way, upon this &s;ide of the contro|ver&s;y, of any who have handled it. Says he, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rea&s;onablene&s;s of conformity to the church of England, p. 249.</NOTE>
<Q>We do not argue meerly from the te&s;timony of &s;o late writers as the&s;e [Jerom and St. Au|&s;tin] that epi&s;copacy is of apo&s;tolical in|&s;titution. We grant it doth not follow, St. Jerom thought &s;o, therefore it is &s;o. But writers of <HI>ALL AGES</HI> in the church witne&s;s that this was the government in their days, that it was in&s;tituted by the apo&s;tles, and delivered down as &s;uch. All that we pro|duce St. Jerom for in this ca&s;e is, that it was in his time, and that he believed it to be apo|&s;tolical, and received it as &s;uch: <HI>but with|out the te&s;timony of THE AGES BEFORE
<PB N="x" REF="012009_0009_0F894158ADDE7650">
HIM, I &s;hould not e&s;teem this a &s;ufficient argument that it was really &s;o.</HI></Q></P>
<P>I SHALL only add, that I have endea|voured to exhibit the following account of the ancient epi&s;copacy, not only with hone&s;t impar|tiality, but meekne&s;s and candor, &s;o as to give no ju&s;t occa&s;ion for complaint, that I have wrote with bitterne&s;s, and under the influence of that "wrath of man which worketh not the rightou&s;|ne&s;s of God." All I de&s;ire is, that tho&s;e into who&s;e hands this work may fall, would read it with like impartiality and candor; in which ca&s;e, I may venture to &s;ay, they will be at no lo&s;s to determine on which &s;ide the truth lies, with re&s;pect to the <HI>fact,</HI> that is the &s;ubject in debate.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>IN all di&s;putes relative to go&s;pel-truth, the demand is ju&s;t, "what &s;aith the &s;crip|ture? To the law, and to the te&s;timony." Such a demand is eminently proper, when the point in di&s;pute is &s;aid to be nearly and clo&s;ely connected with the very being of chri&s;tianity it&s;elf. The &s;acred books of the new-te&s;tament, if at all the rule of chri&s;tian truth, mu&s;t be allowed to be &s;o in in&s;tances that are thus highly intere&s;ting and im|portant.</P>
<P>IT were to be wi&s;hed, the&s;e in&s;pired books had been more generally honored, as the only &s;ufficient rule of judgment, by tho&s;e who have wrote in favor of EPISCOPACY, upon the plan of a DIVINE RIGHT; and the rather, as they &s;peak of it, not meerly as an in&s;titution of the go&s;pel, but an e&s;&s;en|tially nece&s;&s;ary one; in&s;omuch, that go&s;|pel-ordinances
<PB N="ii" REF="012009_0011_0F89415A2DD0AB10">
will be invalid, unle&s;s admi|ni&s;tred by tho&s;e, who have been epi&s;copally ve&s;ted with holy orders.</P>
<P>IN a matter of &s;uch momentous concern, they would not have acted an unworthy part, if they had confined their pleas to the &s;acred writings; producing &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages from them as &s;peak to the point, not im|plicitly and darkly; but in peremptory and expre&s;s terms, &s;o as to leave no rea&s;onable room for he&s;itation or doubt. It would be di&s;honorary to the BIBLE, and a gro&s;s re|flection on the penmen of it, to call that an "appointment of Chri&s;t," and an "e&s;|&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary" one, which is not contained in this &s;acred volume, and with &s;uch clearne&s;s and preci&s;ion, that &s;ober and impartial inquirers may readily perceive it to be there, without foreign help to a&s;&s;i&s;t their &s;ight. And yet, &s;uch help is made nece&s;&s;ary by epi&s;copal-writers. They &s;carce ever fail of turning us to the FATHERS in vindication of their cau&s;e; hereby vir|tually reflecting di&s;grace on the &s;criptures, as though they were in&s;ufficient, &s;imply of them&s;elves, to bring this controver&s;y to an i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P><PB N="iii" REF="012009_0012_0F89415AEDD696B0">WE object not again&s;t paying all due re|&s;pect to the primitive worthies, who were called after the name of Chri&s;t, and ho|nored that name by their faithful labors in the &s;ervice of the go&s;pel. But we re|member, our Savior has bid us "call no man ma&s;ter on earth," as we have "a ma&s;|ter in heaven," the only one he will allow us to own by that name. We cannot there|fore but judge it unwarrantable to take our &s;entiments, relative to any chri&s;tian truth, from meer men, however pious, learned, or ancient; or however a&s;&s;embled in coun|cils or &s;ynods. This, we imagine, would be a di&s;honor to Chri&s;t, the founder and revealer of our holy religion. He has given us the writings of the evangeli&s;ts and apo&s;tles to be the rule of our faith and practice; and it is, as we think, &s;o perfect and &s;ufficient an one, that we have no need to have recour&s;e to <HI>human,</HI> and therefore fallible, writers, either ancient or modern; yea, it is our firm per&s;ua&s;ion, that all that is delivered for "the truth as it is in Je|&s;us" by the FATHERS of whatever age, &s;tation, country, or character, ought to be judged of by this &s;acred and unerring rule: and if what they &s;ay does not agree here|with, there is, &s;o far, no light nor truth in them.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="012009_0013_0F89415BACBB56F8">IN order to reconcile the appeal that is &s;o often made to the FATHERS with that honor which is due to the &s;criptures, the epi&s;|copalian-plea is, that they con&s;ider the&s;e fathers, not as <HI>judges,</HI> but <HI>witne&s;&s;es</HI> only in their cau&s;e. But what are they brought to witne&s;s? Is it, that epi&s;copacy is an in&s;titution of Je&s;us Chri&s;t? If this is witne&s;&s;ed to in the &s;acred books, of which we, having the&s;e in our hands, are as good judges as they, it is &s;ufficient. There is no need of any foreign te&s;timony. If it is not, no other te&s;timony can &s;upply this defect. Are the&s;e fathers cited as witne&s;&s;es to what was the PRACTICE in their day? This is now generally the pretence. They may, &s;ay the epi&s;copalians, be properly appealed to, in order to know the truth of FACT in the ages in which they lived. And if, from their unanimous te&s;timony, even from the fir&s;t days of chri&s;tianity, it appears, that GO|VERNING and ORDAINING AUTHORITY was exerci&s;ed by BISHOPS ONLY, in di&s;tinc|tion from Pre&s;byters, and as an order in the the church above them, it would argue great arrogance, if not ob&s;tinate perver&s;ene&s;s, to di&s;pute the divine original of epi&s;copacy. But we mu&s;t be excu&s;ed, however perver&s;e we may be accounted, if we cannot bring
<PB N="v" REF="012009_0014_0F89415C71CA27A0">
our &s;elves to think, that the practice of the church, &s;ince the apo&s;tles days, however univer&s;al, will ju&s;tify our receiving that as an in&s;titution of Chri&s;t, and an e&s;&s;entially important one, which he him&s;elf hath not clearly and evidently made &s;o, either in his own per&s;on, or by tho&s;e in&s;pired writers, whom he commi&s;&s;ioned and in&s;tructed to declare his will: nor can we believe, the great author of chri&s;tianity would have put the profe&s;&s;ors of it to the difficult, I may &s;ay, as to mo&s;t of them, the impo&s;&s;ible ta&s;k of collecting any thing e&s;&s;ential to their &s;al|vation from the voluminous records of an|tiquity. We are rather per&s;uaded, he has ordered every article that is nece&s;&s;ary, either in point of faith or practice, to be &s;o fairly and legibly wrote by the &s;acred penmen, as that there &s;hould be no need of having recour&s;e to the ancient Fathers as WITNESSES, any more than judges, to a&s;certain his mind. To &s;uppo&s;e the contrary, would, in reality of con&s;truction, &s;ub&s;titue TRADITION the rule of e&s;&s;ential truth, in the room of the SCRIP|TURES, which were "given by in&s;piration of God;" or, at lea&s;t, make the former &s;o much a part of this rule, as that the latter, without it, would not be &s;ufficiently compleat. Such di&s;honor ought not to be ca&s;t on
<PB N="vi" REF="012009_0015_0F89415D2C4C8BB0">
the one only &s;tandard of the real mind of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>NOT that we &s;hould be under any fear|ful apprehen&s;ion, was the epi&s;copal-di&s;pute to be decided SOLELY by what can be prov|ed to be FACT, re&s;pecting the practice of the church before the coming on of tho&s;e ages, in which it is known that &s;uper&s;tition and corruption had unhappily got mixed with mo&s;t, if not all the appointments of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. It has indeed been long given out, and of late with more po&s;itive a&s;|&s;urance than common, that within the two fir&s;t centuries, tho&s;e pure&s;t and truly primi|tive ones, and all along through them, as well as in after ages, UNIVERSAL CONSENT is ju&s;tly pleadable in favor of epi&s;copacy. The de&s;ign of the en&s;uing work is to put it in the power of all intelligent readers, whe|ther learned or unlearned, to judge for them|&s;elves in this matter; and that they might be able to do it upon ju&s;t and &s;olid grounds, not here and there a detached te&s;timony, from this and the other &s;elected father, is brought to view, but the WHOLE, until towards the clo&s;e of the &s;econd century, they have ALL &s;aid relative to the affair of Bi&s;hops. If the con&s;ent of the church, through this long
<PB N="vii" REF="012009_0016_0F89415DEC8FA760">
and important period, without which it is impo&s;&s;ible it &s;hould be UNIVERSAL, can be known at all, it may be known in this way; and it is the only one in which it can be known with any degree of certainty. The di&s;pute about epi&s;copacy, &s;o far as it depends upon UNIVERSAL CONSENT, may be fairly and fully determined by every one for him&s;elf, by what is herewith offered to his peru&s;al.</P>
<P>THE method, according to which I pro|po&s;e to proceed, is this ea&s;y and plain one. The fathers will be di&s;tinctly mentioned one by one, their characters given, their writ|ings &s;pecified, and what they &s;ay relative to EPISCOPACY faithfully &s;et down, with &s;uch ob&s;ervations and remarks as may be thought needful. And they will &s;everally be brought to view in the order in which they are commonly placed, by the learned in &s;ubjects of this nature; or, in other words, according to the time, in which it is &s;uppo&s;ed they wrote. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It may be proper to give notice to the reader, that, in &s;peci|fying the date of the re&s;pective writings, from which I have extracted, I have only referred in general to the opinion of others, ver&s;ed in this kind of learning. It would have re|quired a volume of it&s;elf, to have fixed the mo&s;t probable date of each writing, and to have a&s;&s;igned the rea&s;ons, why this date, rather than any other was pitched upon; which would have been a needle&s;s labour to me, and of no benefit to the reader, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="012009_0017_0F89415F923967C0">ONLY, before I proceed, I would make the following rea&s;onable reque&s;t. It is, that every one would keep critically in view, as he goes along, the SPECIFIED FACT in di&s;|pute. And that he may be able to do this without mi&s;take, I &s;hall, in a few words, di&s;tinctly point it out.</P>
<P>THE Bi&s;hop, in who&s;e defence an appeal is made to antiquity, is not related, by his office, to a &s;ingle congregation of chri&s;tians only, with one or more Pre&s;byters belong|ing to it; but his charge is a DIOCESS, con|&s;i&s;ting of a number of congregations, great|er or le&s;s, with their re&s;pective Pre&s;byters. The inquiry therefore is, whether it be an UNI|VERSALLY ATTESTED FACT, that epi&s;co|pacy, in this &s;en&s;e, took place in, and through, the two fir&s;t ages? A Bi&s;hop, at the head of a number of congregations, greater or le&s;s, is an officer in the church of Chri&s;t quite different from the pa&s;tor of a &s;ingle congregation; though he &s;hould be called Bi&s;hop, as being the HEAD-PRESBYTER, or ve&s;ted with the character of PRIMUS INTER PARES.

under&s;tanding, after he has gone over the following te&s;timonies, to &s;ay, whether he thinks, that Bi&s;hops, after the DIOCESANMODE, were known in the fir&s;t ages of the church?</P>
<P>THE Bi&s;hop, for whom the fathers are called in as WITNESSES, is an officer in the church of an ORDER SUPERIOR to that of Pre&s;byters, and as di&s;tinct from it as the or|der of Pre&s;byters is for that of Deacons; the pretence being this, that Pre&s;byters were thought to have, in primitive times, no more right to meddle with the peculiar work of Bi&s;hops, than Deacons have to concern them&s;elves with the peculiar work of Pre&s;|byters. The que&s;tion therefore is, Whe|ther it will appear, from the following evi|dence, to be at all a FACT, much le&s;s an UNIVERSALLY known, and certainly atte&s;t|ed one, that there were Bi&s;hops, in this &s;en&s;e, in any church, in any part of the chri&s;tian world, within the two fir&s;t cen|turies?</P>
<P>THE Bi&s;hop, in who&s;e favor the ancient Fathers are &s;aid univer&s;ally to &s;peak, is one to whom the EXCLUSIVE RIGHT OF GO|VERNMENT has been committed by the appointment of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, or his apo&s;tles

<Q>And here&mdash;I think I may &s;ay, that we have as univer&s;al and as unanimous a te&s;timony of all writers, and hi&s;torians from the apo&s;tles days, as could rea&s;onably be ex|pected or de&s;ired: every one, who &s;peaks of the government of the church, in any place, witne&s;&s;ing, that epi&s;copacy was the &s;ettled form; and every one, who hath occa&s;ion to &s;peak of the original of it, tracing it up to the apo&s;tles days, and fixing it upon their decree.&mdash;Were there only te&s;timonies to be produced, that this was the government of the church in all ages, it would be but rea&s;onable to con|clude it of apo&s;tolical in&s;titution;&mdash;but when we find the &s;ame per&s;ons witne&s;&s;ing, not only that it was epi&s;copal, but that it was of apo&s;tolical in&s;titution, and deliver|ed down from the beginning as &s;uch, this adds weight to the matter, and makes it more undoubted. So that here are two points to which they bear witne&s;s, that this was the government of the church
<PB N="xi" REF="012009_0020_0F894161AD8FAE58">
in their days, and that it was of apo&s;to|lical in&s;titution. And in the&s;e there is &s;uch a con&s;tancy and unanimity, that even St. Jerom him&s;elf traces up epi&s;copacy to the very apo&s;tles, and makes it of their in&s;titution.</Q>
&mdash; He adds,
<Q>All churches and chri&s;tians, as far as we know, &s;eem to have been agreed, in this point, amid&s;t all their other differences, as univer&s;ally as can well be imagined.</Q>
One would &s;uppo&s;e, from the peremptory manner in which this citation is expre&s;&s;ed, that the FACT it affirms was &s;o evidently clear, as to leave no room for the lea&s;t doubt. Tho&s;e, who may think it worth while to look over the <HI>te&s;timonies</HI> brought to view, in the fol|lowing pages, will perhaps, by critically ob|&s;erving their real and ju&s;t import, be &s;ur|prized, that any man of learning, who pro|fe&s;&s;es a regard to truth, &s;hould &s;peak of it, and with &s;uch a degree of a&s;&s;urance, as the UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF ALL AGES from the apo&s;tles, that epi&s;copacy, in the impleaded &s;en&s;e, was the "form of go|vernment in the church in their day," and that it was by "apo&s;tolical in&s;titution;" e&s;pe|cially, if they &s;hould not be able to find, as it is certain they will not, &s;o much as a &s;ingle witne&s;s, for two hundred years,

who&s;e evidence is clear, direct, expre&s;s, and full, in affirming, either that this was the form of government in the church, or that it was ever in&s;tituted by Chri&s;t, or his ao&s;|tles: &s;o far is it from the truth, that this is a FACT UNANIMOUSLY and CONSTANTLY TESTIFIED TO, even from the beginning, and through all ages.</P>
<P>THE Bi&s;hop, for the &s;upport of who&s;e claims antiquity is repaired to, is one with whom the SOLE POWER of ORDINATION is lodged; in&s;omuch, that he only can con|vey holy orders conformably to the appoint|ment of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and &s;hould Pre&s;byters pre&s;ume to do this, they would take that upon them which they have no more a right to, than Deacons have to bapti&s;e, or admi|ni&s;ter the Lord's &s;upper. This part of the UNANIMOUS report of ALL AGES concern|ing the EXCLUSIVE RIGHT of Bi&s;hops de|&s;erves mo&s;t of all the &s;pecial notice of the reader; and he is particularly de&s;ired, as he goes along, to point out to him&s;elf, for his own &s;atisfaction; or to others, for their in|formation, any one among all the te&s;ti|monies he will have placed before his view, that plainly and directly affirms the RIGHT OF ORDINATION to be peculiar to Bi&s;hops as a di&s;tinct order from Pre&s;byters, and &s;uperi|or to them; or that this right was ever thus ex|erci&s;ed
<PB N="xiii" REF="012009_0022_0F8941632CA12008">
by them. If he &s;hould not be able to do this, as unque&s;tionably he will not, how &s;trange mu&s;t that affirmation appear, which &s;ays, in the mo&s;t po&s;itive terms, not only that this is FACT, but a fact CONSTANTLY and UNANIMOUSLY witne&s;&s;ed to by the fathers, in ALL AGES from the days of the apo&s;tles.</P>
<P>THE Bi&s;hop, in who&s;e defence antiquity is pleaded, is ve&s;ted with the power of CON|FIRMATION, according to the mode of the church of England; and it is appropriated to him as his right in di&s;tinction from all others. But I need not a&s;&s;ure the reader, he will in vain look to find it a FACT, with|in the two fir&s;t ages, that Bi&s;hops were ei|ther ve&s;ted with, or ever exerci&s;ed this pow|er. For he mu&s;t come down below the&s;e ages, before a word is &s;aid, by any one of the fathers, relative to this &s;uper&s;titious practice. Tertullian is the fir&s;t that mentions it; and he mentions likewi&s;e &s;ome other corrup|tions, which had got mingled with chri&s;ti|anity in that day.</P>
<P>IN &s;hort, the que&s;tion in debate, &s;o far as it relates to FACT, is, not whether there were officers in the chri&s;tian church, known by the name of Bi&s;hops in the apo|&s;tolic age, and down along through the two fir&s;t centuries? We join with the epi&s;copa|lians
<PB N="xiv" REF="012009_0023_0F894163ECDA1610">
in affirming this to be a truth univer|&s;ally te&s;tified to in tho&s;e times: but the pro|per que&s;tion is, what is FACT with refer|ence to the ORDER of the&s;e Bi&s;hops, and the POWERS PECULIAR TO THEIR OFFICE, and as EXERCISED by them in it? The name of Bi&s;hop is one thing, and the POWER claimed for, or exerci&s;ed by him, is another. The di&s;pute is, not about the name, but the POWER appropriated to it. This therefore &s;hould be heedfully attended to by all, in their examination of the evidences that will be produced; and they may, in this way, clearly and &s;atisfactorily determine, each one for him&s;elf, whether it be at all an at|te&s;ted FACT, much le&s;s a CONSTANT and UNANIMOUSLY ATTESTED ONE, from the apo&s;tles days, and down along through the two fir&s;t ages, as well as after ones, that Bi|&s;hops were ve&s;ted with, and did actually exer|ci&s;e, the above &s;pecified powers, which are at this day claimed for them, as the appropriate work of their office by divine appointment?</P>
<P>HAVING thus prepared the way, I now go on to introduce the FATHERS, and point out what they &s;ay upon the head of EPIS|COPACY; and &s;hall do it in the order that has been mentioned.</P>

<HEAD>BARNABAS.</HEAD>
<P>WE read, in the &s;acred books, of an eminent convert to the chri&s;|tian faith, under the name of Barnabas. If our Barnabas was this venerable per|&s;on, he is ju&s;tly placed <HI>fir&s;t</HI> among the writers in our propo&s;ed collection. For he lived in the days of the apo&s;tles, was then a preacher of the go&s;pel, and a fel|low-laborer with Paul in a &s;pecial mi&s;&s;ion to the gentile nations, to which they were both &s;eparated by expre&s;s direction of the Holy Gho&s;t. But whether he was this Barnabas, or &s;ome other per&s;on, in or near the apo&s;tolic age, who was called by this name, or cho&s;e, for certain ends, to borrow it, is a point in which neither an|cient nor modern writers are agreed; as we &s;hall pre&s;ently have occa&s;ion to make evident. If he was the &s;cripture-Barna|bas, the be&s;t account of him is contain|ed
<PB N="16" REF="012009_0025_0F8941656DE5C568" MS="y">
in the new-te&s;tament-books, which every one is at liberty to con&s;ult at his lei&s;ure. If he was not this Barnabas, we can know nothing about him, with any degree of certainty, but what may be col|lected from the epi&s;tle that goes under this name.</P>
<P>I SHALL not amu&s;e the reader with the hi&s;tory of his &s;uppo&s;ed &s;ufferings, as a martyr for the cau&s;e of Chri&s;t; much le&s;s with the MIRABILIA that are told of him, and with an air of too much faith, even by Arch-Bi&s;hop Wake, as well as Dr. Cave. For, to &s;peak the truth, I pay no regard to the idle legandary &s;tories, invented by monks, and other eccle&s;ia&s;tics, in the Roman church, after the vi&s;ible ri&s;e of anti-chri&s;t, to impo&s;e upon the people to &s;erve their own ba&s;e and wick|ed de&s;igns.</P>
<P>LEAVING therefore the&s;e extraordina|ries, as not worthy of notice, I go on to &s;peak of his works. Tertullian &s;eems to have been of the opinion, that he was the author of the epi&s;tle to the Hebrews; for he plainly quotes it as his: but it is, with Jerom, a matter of doubt, whether it
<PB N="17" REF="012009_0026_0F8941662C958F18">
ought to be a&s;cribed to him, or Luke, or Clement, or Paul. It does not appear, that Barnabas wrote any thing more than an epi&s;tle that is &s;till extant, at lea&s;t in part, both in greek and latin. The la|tin is thought to be a very ancient ver|&s;ion from the greek; though, when, in what country, or by what hand, it was tran&s;lated, none, &s;o far as I can learn, pre|tend &s;o much as to conjecture. Neither the greek or latin copies are perfect. The beginning is wanting in the greek, and the end in the Latin. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Lardener &s;ays of this epi&s;tle, "It is entire in the la|tin ver&s;ion." Cotelerius declares the contrary. His words are the&s;e, "Vetus antem interpretatio e&s;t imper|fecta et mutila, tum pa&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">m, tum precipue ad finem, ubi po&s;teriora capita re&s;ecantur." The exact truth is, neither the greek or old latin copies are complete; but as the latin contains what was wanting in the greek, and the greek what was wanting in the latin, between them both the epi&s;tle is made entire.</NOTE> Dr. Cave, who was apt to entertain as high an opi|nion of ancient writings as they de&s;erve, de&s;cribes the epi&s;tle of Barnabas in the following words.
<Q>The frame and con|texture of it is intricate and ob&s;cure, made up of uncouth allegories, forced and improbable interpretations of &s;crip|ture; though the main de&s;ign of it is to &s;hew, that the chri&s;tian religion has
<PB N="18" REF="012009_0027_0F894166EDC68568">
&s;uper&s;eded the rites and ceremonies of the Mo&s;aic law. The latter part of it contains an u&s;eful and excellent ex|hortation, managed under the notion of two ways; the one of light, the other of darkne&s;s; the one under the guidance of the angels of God, the other under the conduct of the angels of &s;atan, the prince of the iniquity of the age.</Q></P>
<P>THE chief difficulty, relative to this epi&s;tle, is to know, whether the &s;crip|ture-Barnabas was its author, or &s;ome other per&s;on, really of this name, or by ar|bitrary a&s;&s;umption.</P>
<P>SOME of the ancient Fathers &s;eem to have been of the mind, that the Barna|bas, who was Paul's companion, was the writer of it. Clement of Alexan|dria quotes it in that form, "&s;ays the apo&s;tle Barnabas." Origin, in his an&s;|wer to Cel&s;us, gives this epi&s;tle the title of catholic, "the catholic epi&s;tle of Bar|nabas;" which it is &s;uppo&s;ed he would not have done, had he not e&s;teem|ed its author to have been the Barnabas,
<PB N="19" REF="012009_0028_0F894167ADD20E88">
who&s;e memory is celebrated in the in&s;pired writings. Others, among the fathers, to &s;ay the lea&s;t, were in doubt, whether this epi&s;tle was wrote by Barnabas, who, with Paul, was "&s;eparated to the work, whereunto the Holy Gho&s;t had called them." Eu&s;ebius and Jerom both reck|on it among the "apocryphal books;" and doubtle&s;s for the &s;ame rea&s;on. What this is, we may learn from the epi&s;tle of the latter of the&s;e fathers to Laeta, in which he &s;ays, "Tho&s;e books are apo|cryphal that do not belong to the authors who&s;e name they bear."</P>
<P>THE moderns differ likewi&s;e in their judgment. Pear&s;on, Cave, Du-pin, Wake, and others, &s;uppo&s;e the &s;cripture-Barna|bas to have been the writer of this epi|&s;tle. Cotelerius rather thinks it was &s;ome other per&s;on <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"&mdash;magis inclino ut cen&s;eam, non e&s;&s;e apo&s;toli." And again, "Certe vix credi pote&s;t, quod adeo eximi|us apo&s;tolus&mdash;ea &s;crip&s;erit quae in opu&s;culo pre&s;enti con|tinentur; coactas dico allegorias, enarrationes &s;criptura|rum minus veri&s;imiles, fabulas de animalibus, aliaque."&mdash;</NOTE> of this name, or that appeared under it. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">It may &s;eem &s;trange to many, that writers, in the fir&s;t ages of chri&s;tianity, &s;hould appear, not under their own, but the names of tho&s;e who were in high reputation in their day. But the fact is inconte&s;tibly true. Says the learned Dr. Cave, "If it &s;hall be inquired, why a man, after much pains, &s;hould chu&s;e to publi&s;h his labors rather under another man's name than his own; there needs no other an&s;wer, than that this has been an old trade, which &s;ome men have taken up, either becau&s;e it was their humour to lay their own children at other men's doors, or to decline the cen&s;ure which the notions they publi&s;hed were like|ly to expo&s;e them to, or principally to conciliate the greater e&s;teem and value for them, by thru&s;ting them forth under the name of tho&s;e for whom the world have a ju&s;t regard and veneration."

opinion, it is utterly unworthy of &s;o ex|cellent a man as the Barnabas celebrated in the in&s;pired books. Ba&s;nage and Jones have largely offered their objections again&s;t this epi&s;tle as the genuine work of Barnabas, the companion of Paul. And they appear to me, I truly confe&s;s, to be unan&s;werable. It would carry me too far out of my way to give &s;o much as an ab&s;tract of the&s;e objections. I &s;hall content my&s;elf with only tran&s;cribing a few pa&s;&s;ages in this epi&s;tle, as tran&s;lated by Arch-Bi&s;hop Wake; leaving it with every judicious reader to &s;ay, whether he can think it at all probable, that &s;uch a man as the &s;cripture-Barnabas is known to have been, could have been the author

of them; a convert to the faith in the days of Chri&s;t; one per&s;onally acquaint|ed with the apo&s;tles; a fellow-laborer with them, by the expre&s;s appointment of heaven, in &s;preading the name and reli|gion of Chri&s;t; and, in a word, one that is characteri&s;ed by an in&s;pired pen as "a good man, full of the Holy Gho&s;t, and of faith."

<P>THIS pa&s;&s;age, in the Arch-Bi&s;hop's tran&s;lation, may not appear very &s;triking|ly exceptionable; but it really is &s;o, both in the original greek, and old latin ver&s;i|on.

<P>THE areopagite-&s;enate, &s;o denomina|ted from the famous areopagus, a court-hou&s;e, built upon a hill in Athens, was the mo&s;t &s;acred and venerable tribunal in Greece. All the greater and more capi|tal cau&s;es were brought before it; e&s;pe|cially matters of religion, bla&s;phemy a|gain&s;t the gods, and contempt of the ho|ly my&s;teries. Diony&s;ius is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been one of the judges, when Paul was arraigned before this &s;enate, as "a &s;etter forth of &s;trange gods" for "preach|ing Je&s;us and ana&s;ta&s;is," or the re&s;urrec|tion. It is &s;aid, and upon ju&s;t grounds, that he was converted by this apo&s;tle, while, in the mid&s;t of mars-hall, he made the addre&s;s to the men of Athens, recor|ded

in the 17th Chapter of the Acts. For though we are told, that "&s;ome mock|ed" at this preaching; it is al&s;o affirmed, that "certain men believed, among the which was Diony&s;ius the areopagite." Acts xvii. 32, 34.</P>
<P>NOTHING more is recorded, in the &s;a|cred books, concerning this truly primi|tive father. Eu&s;ebius &s;ays, "he was the fir&s;t Bi&s;hop of Athens; and intro|duces Diony&s;ius of Corinth mentioning the &s;ame thing. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">H. E. Lib. 3. cap. 4. lib. 4. cap. 22.</NOTE> No further notice is taken of him, until we come to ages re|mote from that in which he lived; on which account no great regard is to be paid to the commendations that are there be&s;towed on him, in the highe&s;t &s;trains of hyperbolical language.</P>
<P>NUMEROUS are the writings &s;aid to be left by this Diony&s;ius; for which rea|&s;on only I have given him, among the other fathers, a place in this work. Some there are who &s;trenuou&s;ly plead for the&s;e writings as genuine; though it is uni|ver&s;ally thought by prote&s;tants, and by &s;ome of fame even in the roman commu|nion, that they are fal&s;ely attributed to

him. None have wrote more largely, or with greater learning, in proof of their being &s;purious, than Mon&s;ieur D'aille; who has &s;aid enough to convince all, that are capable of conviction, that this is their true character. The learned Du|pin not only entertained this opinion of them, but has &s;aid that which is abun|dantly &s;ufficient to lead others into the &s;ame judgment about them. I &s;hall here tran&s;cribe one of the many arguments, he has u&s;ed to evidence their being &s;uppo&s;i|titious; and I have &s;elected this for a rea|&s;on that will obviou&s;ly be &s;ugge&s;ted to the reader, when he &s;ees what may be offered re|lative to the writings of another father, held in great reputation, at lea&s;t among &s;ome.</P>
<P>HIS argument is this;
<Q>The manner of the fir&s;t appearing of the&s;e books ought to be &s;u&s;pected. For it is cer|tain, that, being unknown to all anti|quity, they were fir&s;t quoted by the <HI>&s;eve|rian</HI> heretics, in a conference holden be|tween them, and the orthodox Bi&s;hops at Con&s;tantinople, in the palace of the emperor <HI>Ju&s;tinian,</HI> 532 years after the nativity of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. The &s;i|lence of all the ancient eccle&s;ia&s;tical

writers is, without doubt, a very great prejudice to them; for who can ima|gine, that &s;o con&s;iderable an author as St. Denys (if the&s;e books had been real|ly compo&s;ed by him) &s;hould have been unknown to Eu&s;ebius and St. Jerom? And who can believe, that, if they had known them, they &s;hould take no no|tice of them, when they compo&s;ed an exact catalogue of all the authors, of whom they had any knowledge; not omitting even tho&s;e that had <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> little reputation, that they were &s;carcely heard of in the world? Is it po&s;&s;ible that Eu&s;ebius, in making mention of Diony&s;ius the aropagite, in tw<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;everal places, &s;hould not have ob&s;erved, ac|cording to his u&s;ual method, that he had written &s;everal books? St. Jerom, in his epi&s;tle to Magnus, doth not omit the te&s;timony of one &s;ingle author to prove, that it is lawful to make u&s;e of prophane books; whereas the wri|tings of St. Denys might have &s;erved as a notable proof. Why then doth he not &s;peak &s;o much as one word con|cerning them? He gives us an ac|count, in his catalogue, of Quadratus Bi&s;hop of Athens, and of Ari&s;tides
<PB N="31" REF="012009_0040_0F8941716CC9C648">
the athenian philo&s;opher: is it po&s;|&s;ible, that St. Denys &s;hould be more ob|&s;cure than the&s;e two writers, or le&s;s e&s;teemed by St. Jerom? How could it happen, that all the ancient writers mention St. Diony&s;ius the areopagite, as Diony&s;ius Corinthius, St. Chy&s;o|&s;tom, St. Ambro&s;e, St. Augu&s;tine, and the author of the dialogues a&s;cri|bed to St. Cae&s;arius, the brother of St. Gregory Nazianzen, &s;hould give us no intimation of the&s;e books? In &s;hort, why were the&s;e books, which contain many things relating to the doctrine and di&s;cipline of the chri&s;tian church, and that would have been of great au|thority, as proceeding from &s;o ancient and con&s;iderable an author as St. Di|ony&s;ius the areopagite, never cited ei|ther for, or again&s;t any heretic, or for the illu&s;tration of any point of di&s;|cipline before the &s;ixth age of the church?</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>THE writings fal&s;ely atributed to Di|ony&s;ius the areopagite are as follow. A book "concerning the cele&s;tial hierar|chy;" another of "the divine names," another of "my&s;tical divinity;" ten

epi&s;tles; four to "Caius," one to "Dorotheus," another to "So&s;ipater," another to "Polycarp," another to "De|mophilus," another to "Titus," another to "John the evangeli&s;t." The&s;e have been printed, and reprinted, both in greek and latin, in many parts of Europe. Du-pin &s;ays, &s;everal other books were compo|&s;ed by this author, and quoted by him|&s;elf; &s;uch as a book concerning "&s;ymbo|lical knowledge;" another of "the &s;oul;" another of "divine hymns;" another of the "ju&s;t judgment of God; another of "tho&s;e things that are under&s;tood by the mind, and that may be perceived by the &s;en&s;es."&mdash;But the&s;e are all lo&s;t.</P>
<P>THESE books, as Johannes Scotus, the fir&s;t tran&s;lator of them into latin, tells us, are infinitely intricate and perplexed, far beyond the reach of modern apprehen|&s;ion, and which few are able to pierce in|to, by rea&s;on of the &s;ublimity of the my&s;|teries whereof they treat. And, as Dr. Cave ju&s;tly and judiciou&s;ly ob&s;erves,
<Q>Who|ever was their genuine parent, or up|on what account &s;oever he wrote them, it is plain, that he laid the foundation of a my&s;tical and unintelligible divi|nity
<PB N="33" REF="012009_0042_0F894172F6D8F848">
among chri&s;tians, and that hence proceeded all tho&s;e wild ro&s;icru&s;ean notions, which &s;ome men are &s;o fond of, and the life and practice whereof they cry up as the very &s;oul and per|fection of the chri&s;tian religion. And that this author does immediately mi|ni&s;ter to this de&s;ign, let the reader judge by one in&s;tance, and I a&s;&s;ure him none of the mo&s;t ob&s;cure and intricate pa&s;&s;ages in the&s;e books.</Q>
This in&s;tance he gives us, as he him&s;elf declares, ex|pre&s;&s;ed word for word. It is as follows;
<Q>God is known in all things, and without all things. He is known by knowledge, and by ignorance. There is both a co|gitation of him, and a word, and a &s;ci|ence, and a touch, and a &s;en&s;e, and an opinion, and a name, and all other things; and yet, he is neither thought, nor &s;poken, nor named. He is not any thing of tho&s;e things that are, nor is he known in any of the things that are; he is both all things in all, and nothing in nothing; out of all things he is known to all, and out of nothing to nothing. The&s;e are the things which we rightly di&s;cour&s;e concerning God. And this again is the mo&s;t divine knowledge of
<PB N="34" REF="012009_0043_0F894173ABAE6368">
God, that which is known by ignorance, according to the union that is above un|der&s;tanding; when the mind getting at a di&s;tance from all things that are, and ha|ving di&s;mi&s;&s;ed it&s;elf, is united to tho&s;e &s;uperillu&s;trious beams from whence, and where, it is enlightened in the unfa|thomable depths of wi&s;dom.</Q></P>
<P><Q>MORE of this, (&s;ay the Doctor,) and the like &s;tuff is plentifully &s;cattered up and down the&s;e books. And if this be not my&s;tical and profound enough, I know not what is; and which certainly any man, but one well ver&s;ed in this &s;ort of theology, would look upon as &s;trange jargon of non&s;en&s;e and contradiction. And yet, this is the height of devotion and piety, which &s;ome men earne&s;tly pre&s;s after, and wherein they glory: as if a man could not truly under&s;tand the my&s;teries of religion, until he had re|&s;igned his rea&s;on; nor be a chri&s;tian, without fir&s;t becoming an enthu&s;ia&s;t, nor be able to &s;peak &s;en&s;e, unle&s;s in a language which none can under&s;tand.</Q></P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">His character, writings, te&s;timonies from them with ob&s;ervations, and remarks.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Hermas has &s;ometimes been mi&s;|taken for Hermes, brother to Pius I. an eccle&s;ia&s;tic beyond the middle of the &s;econd century. The author of the "pontifi|cal" fathered upon Dama&s;us, the pre|tended "decretals of the Bi&s;hops of Rome," together with &s;ome other ancient, as well as modern writers, have fallen in|to this error, as Du-pin calls it, and has, in common with many other learned men, proved it to be, from all the primi|tive fathers, Clement of Alexandria, Ter|tullian, Origin, Eu&s;ebius, and Jerom; who always call him <HI>Hermas</HI> never <HI>Her|mes.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="012009_0045_0F894175F283FDD8">IT is unque&s;tionable, that there was, in the fir&s;t age, a per&s;on of this name; as the apo&s;tle Paul, among other chri&s;tians at Rome, &s;alutes <HI>Hermas</HI> by name. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. 16.14.</NOTE> It is certain al&s;o, that &s;everal of the fathers thought the &s;cripture-Hermas to be the &s;ame with him, of whom we are &s;peak|ing.

Arch-Bi&s;hop Wake, from &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages in his "Pa&s;tor," mentions &s;everal things, by way of conjecture, de&s;criptive of him; but, as the more ancient records are &s;i|lent about him, I &s;hall pa&s;s from his per&s;on to his</P>

in antiquity. And yet, it is not ea&s;y to &s;ay, what its authority was in tho&s;e days. Irenaeus &s;eems to quote it under <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Bene ergo pronunciavit &s;criptura."</NOTE> "the name of &s;cripture." Clement of Alexandria introduces a ci|tation from it in that language, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">"Theios to Erma meta apokalup&s;in lalou&s;a."</NOTE> "the power which &s;pake divinely to Hermas by revelation." Tertullian, before his profe&s;&s;ing him&s;elf a montani&s;t, &s;peaks of it, if not with any high encomium, yet without intimating a &s;u&s;picion as if it was of no good authority. Origin calls it <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">"Valde mihi utilis videtur et, ut puto, divinitus in&s;pirata."</NOTE> "a very u&s;eful writing, and in his opini|on divinely in&s;pired.

Jerom &s;tiles it, "a truly profi|table book, cited by the greek fathers."</P>
<P>BUT notwith&s;tanding all this, it is &s;ometimes even de&s;pi&s;ed as a work of no value; and this, by &s;ome of the very per|&s;ons above-named. Tertullian, after his

"rejected by all the churches as a fal&s;e and &s;purious writing." Origin &s;ome|times makes the &s;uppo&s;ition, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">"Si cui tamen libellus ille recipiendus videtur."</NOTE> "if it be a book to be received;" and mentions it moreover, "as de&s;pi&s;ed by &s;ome." Je|rom calls it <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">"Liber ille apocryphus &s;tultitiae condemnandus e&s;t."</NOTE> "an apocryphal book, to be condemned for the folly contained in it." Such difficulty is there in a&s;cer|taining the true e&s;timate put upon this writing in ancient times.</P>
<P>NOR are the moderns united in the judgment they pa&s;s on it. They are in|deed unanimou&s;ly agreed to renounce it as "a canonical book;" yet, they differ widely in the value they expre&s;s for it. Some receive it with re&s;pect, as "a vene|rable ancient piece;" while others look upon it as of "little worth." The learn|ed Du-pin gives that account of it,
<Q>It hath not been &s;o much valued by mo|dern authors; and there are very few,

at pre&s;ent, that commend it, or that have the &s;ame regard to it as tho&s;e that lived in the primitive ages of the church. And indeed, if we may judge by the method according to which it is wrote, and by the things therein con|tained, it does not &s;eem to de&s;erve much e&s;teem. The fir&s;t part, entitled, "the vi&s;ions," is full of many revelations that are explained to Hermas by "a wo|man" repre&s;enting the church. They all relate to the &s;tate of the church, and the manners of chri&s;tians. The &s;econd part, which is mo&s;t u&s;eful, is called "the ordinances," wherein are compri&s;ed diver&s;e precepts of morality, and pious in&s;tructions, which the pa&s;tor," or "angel of Hermas" pre|&s;cribes to him. The third part is cal|led, the "&s;imilitudes," becau&s;e it be|gins with &s;everal "&s;imilies," or com|pari&s;ons, and concludes with vi&s;ions. The&s;e three books comprehend very many moral in&s;tructions concerning the practice of chri&s;tian virtues; but the great number of vi&s;ions, allegories, and &s;imilitudes, make them tedious. And all the&s;e moral truths would, in my opinion, have been more u&s;eful, if
<PB N="40" REF="012009_0049_0F894178EDA3CEB0">
the author had propounded them &s;im|ply, as the apo&s;tles had done in their epi&s;tles.</Q></P>
<P>THIS work was penned in greek; though we have now extant only an old latin ver&s;ion. Barthius &s;uppo&s;es it not to have been tran&s;lated until the days of Jerom, becau&s;e that writer &s;peaks of it as "much u&s;ed among the greeks, but &s;carce known to the latins" But Cote|lerius herein oppo&s;es him, proving it to have been read, by &s;everal of the latins before the age of Jerom; and probably they read it in the pre&s;ent tran&s;lation: though it is not known, at this day, by whom it was made: nor can the time of writing this "pa&s;tor" be brought, with certainty, to an exact period. Arch-Bi&s;hop Wake places it the la&s;t piece but one in his "apo&s;to|lical fathers." He might probably think it was wrote after the epi&s;tles of Igna|tius and Polycarp. But it is mo&s;t common|ly &s;uppo&s;ed to have been wrote much &s;ooner. Some place its date about the year 90, a little before the diocle&s;ian per&s;ecution which he is thought to re|fer to in his "fourth vi&s;ion." Others

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS and REMARKS upon the foregoing te&s;timonies.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages in Hermas, which are all I can find to the purpo&s;e of the pre&s;ent controver&s;y, the reader may, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, perceive the ob&s;curity, with which his writings are perplexed. It appears that he has, here and there, drop|ed a few words that bear relation to the point we are upon; but what he has &s;aid is generally &s;o blended with vi&s;ionary or parabolical matter, that it is not ea&s;y, by any rational connection in his di&s;cour&s;e, to determine his meaning; and if we would under&s;tand him, we mu&s;t ordina|rily confine our&s;elves to the words bare|ly as they lie; unle&s;s, by comparing them with others of the like import, in other parts of his writing, we may be helped in fixing their true &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT dark as he is, there are &s;ome plain intimations, that the world, in his day, were not acquainted with Bi&s;hops, as offi|cers &s;uperior in their ORDER to Pre&s;byters; yea, that the churches were &s;o far from being modelled after the pre&s;ent epi&s;copal form, that the management of their reli|gious
<PB N="49" REF="012009_0058_0F8941806F733F50">
affairs was in the hands, not of SINGLE PERSONS, but a PLURALITY; and this, of EQUAL RANK. It is a com|mon phra&s;e in the&s;e writings, "qui prae&s;unt eccle&s;iae," that is, "who are &s;et over the church." And le&s;t it &s;hould be pretended, the word, church, is u&s;ed to &s;ignify the church-catholic, in which &s;en&s;e it might be true, that it had a plurality &s;et over it, though parti|cular churches had only a &s;ingle Bi&s;hop at their head: I &s;ay, to take away all ground for &s;uch a pretence, we have &s;uch an ob|&s;ervable pa&s;&s;age as that, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vi&s;. II. Sect. IV.</NOTE> "And thou (Hermas) &s;halt read in THIS CITY with the elders who are &s;et over the church." A more expre&s;s te&s;timony could not well be given to this FACT, that the church of Rome, at lea&s;t, was, in this age, go|verned, not by any <HI>&s;ingle pa&s;tor</HI> but a <HI>plu|rality,</HI> which plurality were <HI>Pre&s;byters,</HI> or if you plea&s;e <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI>; meaning hereby the SAME ORDER of officers in the church. For it is remarkable, the word, Bi&s;hops, (Epi&s;copi) is explained by Hermas him|&s;elf to &s;ignify, "Prae&s;ides eccle&s;iarum;" <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sim. IX. Sect. XXVII.</NOTE> that is to &s;ay, he de&s;cribes Bi&s;hops by
<PB N="50" REF="012009_0059_0F8941812D411158">
their being "tho&s;e who are &s;et over the church;" and tho&s;e who are "&s;et over the church" he expre&s;&s;ly calls <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vi&s;. II. Sect. IV.</NOTE> ("Se|niores") Elders, or Pre&s;byters; &s;o that, as it happily falls out, Bi&s;hops and Pre&s;by|ters, according to Hermas's own explana|tion of him&s;elf, are one and the &s;ame offi|cers in the church, &s;poken of promi&s;|cuou&s;ly, as in the new-te&s;tament-writings, under the names of Bi&s;hops or Pre&s;|byters.</P>
<P>BUT that this matter may be &s;et in a yet &s;tronger point of light, I &s;hall bring to view, and con&s;ider, what is brought from Hermas in favor of the di&s;tincti|on, he is &s;uppo&s;ed, by epi&s;copalian writers, to make between Bi&s;hops and Pre&s;by|ters. And,</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t pa&s;&s;age to this purpo&s;e, we have in Vi&s;. II. Sect. IV, in which it is &s;aid, "Thou &s;halt write two books, and &s;end one to Clement, and one to Grapte. And Clement &s;hall &s;end it to the foreign cities; for to him it is permitted." In the&s;e words, &s;ome are &s;o &s;harp-&s;ighted as
<PB N="51" REF="012009_0060_0F894181EDA637E0">
to perceive plain evidence of epi&s;copal &s;uperiority. For, &s;ay they, Clement was now Bi&s;hop of Rome, and the care of "&s;ending this book," or letter, to the "foreign cities," was devolved on him, without all doubt, in virtue of his office, as head of the church; to whom, upon this account, this bu&s;ine&s;s mo&s;t properly belonged.</P>
<P>THE an&s;wer is ea&s;y. That Clement was now Bi&s;hop of Rome, meaning here|by the &s;ingle head, or governor of this church, is &s;o far from being probable, that the direct contrary hereto is mo&s;t evidently &s;ignified by Hermas's "pa&s;tor," in the latter part of this very paragraph; where he &s;peaks of the church of Rome as under the government, not of any &s;in|gle per&s;on. And thou "&s;halt read in THIS CITY with the ELDERS who are &s;et over the church:" which words, I am per&s;uaded, can never be made to con&s;i&s;t with Clement's being now the epi&s;copal head of this church. He might, at this time, be related to the church of Rome, as one of their Bi&s;hops, or Elders; and he might al&s;o be the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed and di&s;tingui&s;hed among them; the mo&s;t
<PB N="52" REF="012009_0061_0F894182AC6036D8">
known, valued, and re&s;pected: to whom, upon the&s;e accounts, it might be given in charge, rather than to any of the other Elders or Bi&s;hops, to &s;end this book, or epi&s;tle; but not becau&s;e it &s;o belonged to him of right, and in virtue of his office, as that it could not have been devolved upon any other. It does not appear, either from Hermas, or any other ancient writer, that the care of &s;ending letters to the churches was the work of Bi&s;hops, as a peculiar badge of their office. The mo&s;t capable, or mo&s;t univer&s;ally known officer, in any church, might ordinarily be pitched upon to do this; and nothing more can be ar|gued from it, than that he was thought the be&s;t qualified per&s;on for &s;uch a work. Mo&s;t certainly, it is too trifling a matter on which to found a di&s;tinction of order between the officers of a church.</P>
<P>THE next pa&s;&s;age recurred to we have, in Vi&s;. III. Sect. V. in which are the&s;e words; "The &s;quare and the white &s;tones are the Apo&s;tles, and Bi&s;hops, and Doctors, and Mini&s;ters, who, through the mercy of God, have come in, and exerci&s;ed epi&s;co|pacy, and taught, and mini&s;tred." Co|telerius's note here is. "Hic habes.&mdash;In
<PB N="53" REF="012009_0062_0F8941836CB39A80">
Engli&s;h thus, "You have here the di&s;|tinct orders of the hierarchy, in apo&s;tles, in Bi&s;hops exerci&s;ing epi&s;copacy, in Doc|tors or Pre&s;byters teaching, and in Dea|cons mini&s;tring." And the common plea of prelatical writers, from this pa&s;|&s;age, is, that the three officers of the church, <HI>Bi&s;hops, Pre&s;byters,</HI> and <HI>Deacons,</HI> are here directly mentioned; and the di&s;tinction of their offices plainly in&s;i|nuated by di&s;tinct work a&s;&s;igned them; the Bi&s;hops being de&s;cribed by their "ex|erci&s;ing epi&s;copacy," the Doctors or Pre&s;|byters by their "teaching," and the Dea|cons by their "mini&s;tring."</P>
<P>THIS turn given to the words, may, to tho&s;e who have not read the "pa&s;tor of Hermas," carry the appearance of plau|&s;ibility; but, when fairly and impartial|ly examined, they will be found to make nothing again&s;t the affirmation, that Bi|&s;hops and Pre&s;byters are one and the &s;ame order of officers in the church of Chri&s;t. Two things are here pleaded.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t is, that direct mention is here made of three &s;orts of officers in the church, viz. <HI>Bi&s;hops, Doctors</HI> or <HI>Pre&s;by|ters,</HI>
<PB N="54" REF="012009_0063_0F8941842DC34178">
and <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> or <HI>Deacons.</HI>" But if the word, <HI>Doctors,</HI> is here u&s;ed exegeti|cally; not &s;pecifying di&s;tinct officers from Bi&s;hops, but meaning only a difference in the work of one and the &s;ame officers, there is plainly no force in the argument from this enumeration. And that this is really the truth of the matter, I &s;hall now make evident, beyond all rea&s;onable di&s;pute, even from Hermas him&s;elf. In order whereto,</P>
<P>LET us turn to Simil. IX. Sect. XXVII. where we have the&s;e words, "As con|cerning the tenth mountain, in which were trees that covered the cattle, they are &s;uch as have believed, certain Bi&s;hops, that is, per&s;ons &s;et over the churches,&mdash; and then &s;uch as are &s;et over the &s;ervices, who have protected the poor and widows," In this pa&s;&s;age two or three things are very ob&s;ervable. (1) That the word, Bi&s;hops, is particularly explained, and its &s;en&s;e, as u&s;ed in the writings of Hermas, punc|tually a&s;certained: which I thus notice, pre&s;uming it will be acknowledged rea|&s;onable to &s;tand to that &s;en&s;e of a word, in an author, which he him&s;elf has given of it. (2) It is plain, the words, "Epi&s;|copi," and "Prae&s;ides eccle&s;iarum," do, in
<PB N="55" REF="012009_0064_0F894184EC0A17F8">
Hermas, &s;ignify preci&s;ely one and the &s;ame thing. That is to &s;ay, "Bi&s;hops," and "&s;uch as are &s;et over the church," do intend one and the &s;ame order of church-officers. For the explanati|on, given by Hermas, of the word "Bi|&s;hops," is, their being per&s;ons that are "&s;et over the church." (3) Here are evi|dently TWO, and ONLY TWO ORDERS of church-officers &s;pecified; namely, <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> and <HI>Deacons</HI>: Bi&s;hops, under that &s;tile, "Prae&s;ides eccle&s;iarum," per&s;ons "&s;et over the church;" and DEACONS, characteri&s;ed by the phra&s;e, "Prae&s;ides mini&s;teriorum," &s;uch as were "&s;et over the &s;ervices;" that is, that had the care of "the poor, and the widows," as follows in the next words; which perfectly co|incide with the original rea&s;on of the in|&s;titution of the Deacon's office, and de|&s;cribe its proper work.</P>
<P>THESE things con&s;idered, I fear not to &s;ay, that there is good rea&s;on, why, when Hermas &s;peaks of "Bi&s;hops, and Doc|tors, and Mini&s;ters," we &s;hould under|&s;tand the words, "Doctors," exegetically, or explicative of the word, "Bi&s;hops;" not intending a di&s;tinct order of officers,
<PB N="56" REF="012009_0065_0F894185ABA631C0">
but rather pointing our thoughts to dif|ferent work of the &s;ame officers. And, in truth, unle&s;s we interpret the word after this, or &s;ome &s;uch &s;en&s;e, we &s;hall &s;et Her|mas at odds with him&s;elf. For he has mo&s;t punctually a&s;certained the meaning of the word, "Bi&s;hops," making it to &s;ig|nify preci&s;ely the &s;ame thing with "prae|&s;ides eccle&s;iarum," per&s;ons "&s;et over the church." Now the phra&s;e, "Prae&s;ides ec|cle&s;iarum," is perfectly the &s;ame with, "qui prae&s;unt eccle&s;iae;" which, in Vi&s;. II. Sect. IV, is, in the mo&s;t expre&s;s man|ner, applied to <HI>Presbyters</HI> or <HI>Elders.</HI> "Thou &s;halt read [cum Senioribus, qui prae&s;unt eccle&s;iae] with the <HI>Elders,</HI> or <HI>Presbyters,</HI> that are &s;et over the church." So that, by the mo&s;t ea&s;y and natural deduction, Bi&s;hops and Pre&s;byters, according to Her|mas, are the SAME ORDER of officers in the church: Nor can Hermas be ever made con&s;i&s;tent with him&s;elf, unle&s;s, when he &s;peaks of "Bi&s;hops and Doctors," we take him to u&s;e the word, "Doctors," as exegetical of the word, "Bi&s;hops," or a &s;ynonimous expletive; meaning only the &s;ame order of per&s;ons by both the&s;e terms. And, this interpretation will appear more ea&s;y, if it be con&s;idered, that the words,
<PB N="57" REF="012009_0066_0F89418751FE5A90">
"Bi&s;hops" and "Doctors," are common|ly u&s;ed in the writings of all antiquity, as &s;ynonimous terms. Nor is the term, "Doctor," ever appropriated to Pre&s;byters in di&s;tinction from Bi&s;hops. Far from this, even after the di&s;tinction between Bi&s;hops obtained in the church, the word, "Doctors", is commonly applied to Bi|&s;hops: nor was it ever an appropriated term to point out Pre&s;byters in di&s;tinction from Bi&s;hops.</P>
<P>MOREOVER, it ought to be con&s;idered, Hermas never makes the like enumerati|on, "Apo&s;tles, and Bi&s;hops, and Doc|tors, and Mini&s;ters;" but &s;everal times makes another, by which this ought, in all rea&s;on, to be explained. In Simil IV. Sect. XV. it is &s;aid, "the forty &s;tones are the Apo&s;tles and Doctors of the preaching of the &s;on of God. Again, in Sim. ib. Sect. XVI. The&s;e &s;ame "forty &s;tones" are explained to mean, "the Apo&s;tles and Doctors of the preaching of the name of the Son of God." Yet again Sim. ib. Sect. XXV. We read of &s;uch as "be|lieved the Apo&s;tles and certain Doctors, who &s;incerely preached the word." In all the&s;e places, mention is made only of
<PB N="58" REF="012009_0067_0F894187EC62D6B8">
"Apo&s;tles" and "Doctors." But, if Doctors did not mean the &s;ame thing with Bi&s;hops, it is very extraordinary, and no epi&s;copalian can account for it, that Bi|&s;hops &s;hould always be omitted in the&s;e enumerations, and "Doctors" always men|tioned. And truly, by this frequent coupling of Apo&s;tles and Doctors, it is quite natural to think, that Doctors were, in the opinion of Hermas, the next offi|cers in the church to Apo&s;tles, and by no means an order INFERIOR to Bi&s;hops.</P>
<P>IT may be properly added, as Hermas had been &s;peaking of "four-cornered &s;tones," it is highly probable, if not cer|tain, that he mentions the four names, "apo&s;tles, Bi&s;hops, Doctors, and Mini|&s;ters," only to make out &s;omething that might look like an analogy. In other pla|ces, where he had not to do with "&s;quare &s;tones," he gives us no &s;uch enumera|tion. For my&s;elf, I am fully per&s;uaded, we &s;hould not have had it here, had it not been for this trifling circum&s;tance. Put if any &s;hould in&s;i&s;t upon the nece&s;&s;i|ty of a &s;trict and proper analogy, and that it was Hermas's de&s;ign to exhibit one, the con&s;equence would be as fatal
<PB N="59" REF="012009_0068_0F894188AC43A658">
to the cau&s;e of epi&s;copacy, as to that of pre&s;byteriani&s;m. For, upon this &s;uppo&s;iti|on, there mu&s;t be FOUR ORDERS in the church, not THREE, an&s;wering to the "four corners" of the&s;e "&s;quare-&s;tones;" and the "Apo&s;tles," here mentioned, mu&s;t be officers as <HI>di&s;tinct</HI> from the "Bi|&s;hops," as the "Bi&s;hops" are from the "Doctors:" but how con&s;i&s;tent this will be with the pretence, that Bi&s;hops are ve&s;t|ed with the apo&s;tolic office, as their pro|per and only &s;ucce&s;&s;ors; I mu&s;t leave tho&s;e to determine, who&s;e concern it is to do &s;o.</P>
<P>THE other branch of the plea is, that Hermas not only mentions "Bi&s;hops, and Doctors or Pre&s;byters, and Mini&s;ters or Deacons;" but plainly in&s;inuates a di&s;|tinction of order between them, by di&s;|tinct works a&s;&s;igned them: for, he re|pre&s;ents the Bi&s;hops, as "exerci&s;ing epi&s;|copacy;" the Doctors, as "teaching;" and the mini&s;ters, as "mini&s;tring."</P>
<P>AND it is confe&s;&s;ed, if, in the age of Hermas, the work of "exerci&s;ing epi&s;|copacy," and the work of "preaching," were &s;eparated from each other, as they too commonly are now a days, the argu|ment
<PB N="60" REF="012009_0069_0F8941896C08DF78">
would carry with it &s;ome force. It is in fact true, at pre&s;ent, that tho&s;e "exerci&s;e epi&s;copacy," who &s;eldom or never exerci&s;e them&s;elves in "preaching." And, indeed, it rarely happens, that the per&s;ons ve&s;ted with the epi&s;copal office concern them&s;elves much with this other bu&s;ine&s;s. But it was not thus from the beginning. Preaching was not then looked upon as the di&s;tingui&s;hing mark of officers inferior to Bi&s;hops: but, for many ages, the work of "exerci&s;ing epi&s;|copacy," and the work of "preaching," were both united in one and the &s;ame of|ficer of the church; and "laboring in the word and doctrine" was the mo&s;t known, and di&s;tingui&s;hing character of all that were Bi&s;hops: in&s;omuch, that a &s;ingle in&s;tance cannot be produced (I &s;peak it with great po&s;itivene&s;s) of a per|&s;on "exerci&s;ing epi&s;copacy," that did not, at the &s;ame time, make it his <HI>chief</HI> bu&s;ine&s;s to "preach;" until we come in|to tho&s;e ages, in which the gro&s;&s;e&s;t cor|ruptions were prevalent among all orders and degrees of men in the church. So that, it is no argument, that the "Doc|tors" in Hermas were di&s;tinct officers from Bi&s;hops, becau&s;e they are &s;poken of
<PB N="61" REF="012009_0070_0F89418A2D8CA8E8">
as "preaching," and the Bi&s;hops as "ex|erci&s;ing epi&s;copacy." For the&s;e are both parts of one and the &s;ame office; and were always joined together, until, by corruption, they were &s;eparated. A Bi|&s;hop that was not a "Doctor," or "teach|er," was not known in the world in pri|mitive times. It is therefore impo&s;&s;ible, the "Doctors", in this pa&s;&s;age, could be di&s;tinct officers from the "Bi&s;hops," for this rea&s;on; as it had no exi&s;tence until hundreds of years after its being penned. It is far more rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, the &s;ame order of officers are here called both "Bi|&s;hops" and "Doctors," as pointing us to both parts of their office, "exerci&s;ing epi&s;copacy" and "preaching," or "teach|ing."</P>
<P>THE only remaining places in Hermas, in which epi&s;copacy is &s;ought for, are Vi&s;. III. Sect. IX. "I &s;ay unto you who are &s;et over the church, and love the <HI>fir&s;t &s;eats.</HI>" Mand. XII. Sect. VII. "The earthly &s;pirit exalteth it&s;elf, and will have the <HI>fir&s;t chair.</HI>" Simil. VI. Sect. VII. "They are &s;uch&mdash;as had &s;ome envy and &s;trife among them&s;elves for <HI>principality</HI> and <HI>dignity.</HI>" The plea here is, though

Hermas blames all contention about "precedence;" yet he plainly &s;uppo&s;es, at the &s;ame time, a <HI>fir&s;t</HI> or <HI>chief &s;eat</HI>; &s;ome &s;uperior place in the church, proper to per&s;ons of a &s;uperior rank or order; &s;uch as Bi&s;hops in that, and &s;ucceeding ages.</P>
<P>TO which I would &s;ay, it is very plain, from the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages in Hermas, that there was an a&s;&s;uming ambitious &s;pirit then prevailing among tho&s;e, who were "&s;et over the church," which "earthly &s;pirit," as he terms it, he cautions again&s;t, as what ought not to be encouraged. But that he &s;uppo&s;es, when he warns again&s;t "pride, envy, and a love of the fir&s;t &s;eats," there were any officers in the church of a rank or order &s;uperior to that of Pre&s;|byters, there is no ju&s;t ground to think. When Hermas dehorts from "loving the fir&s;t &s;eats, de&s;iring the fir&s;t chair, con|tending for principality and dignity;" he undoubtedly intends, by all the&s;e phra&s;es, one and the &s;ame thing: that is to &s;ay, he had it in view to di&s;countenance that proud, ambitious &s;pirit, which reigned in &s;ome; unrea&s;onably pu&s;hing them on to a&s;pire after &s;uperiority and prece|dence. It does not appear to have been
<PB N="63" REF="012009_0072_0F89418BACA2AE78">
his aim to in&s;inuate a &s;uperiority of or|der between Bi&s;hops and Pre&s;byters; but to check the growing vanity of tho&s;e, who, being of one and the &s;ame rank, yet &s;ought for pre-eminence, and &s;trove to get exalted above their brethren. The temper of the per&s;ons Hermas here finds fault with, &s;eems to have been much the &s;ame with that, which the Apo&s;tles di&s;|covered when they contended, "who among them &s;hould be greate&s;t:" or, ra|ther, like that of Diotrephes, of whom it is &s;aid, "that he loved to have the pre|heminence;" or (as the word <HI>Philopr&oacute;|teuein</HI> &s;ignifies) "loved to hold the fir&s;t place." But, as it is no argument, that there was among the Apo&s;tles any <HI>&s;uperi|ority of order,</HI> becau&s;e they affected &s;ome to be greate&s;t; or, that there was a like &s;uperior office in the church, to which a chief &s;eat was appropriated, becau&s;e Dio|trephes was of an a&s;piring haughty &s;pirit: &s;o neither is it any argument of the &s;ame thing, that Hermas blames the &s;ame &s;pi|rit, and warns again&s;t it.</P>
<P>NOR if, in the days of Hermas, there had been a known <HI>fir&s;t &s;eat,</HI> or <HI>chief chair,</HI> appropriated to &s;ome &s;pecial per&s;on, would
<PB N="64" REF="012009_0073_0F89418C6D7BD450">
it at once follow from hence, that there was a SUPERIORITY OF ORDER between Bi&s;hops and Pre&s;byters. Hermas, to be &s;ure, neither plainly mentions, or tacitly &s;ugge&s;ts, &s;uch a thing; nor makes any ap|plication of <HI>the&s;e &s;eats</HI> to this purpo&s;e.

<HEAD>CLEMENT OF ROME.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">His character, writings, and te&s;timonies from them, with ob&s;ervations and remarks.</HEAD>
<P>THE account we have in the "Re|cognitions" fal&s;ely a&s;cribed to this Clement, of his noble birth and parentage; his being &s;ent by his father Fau&s;tinus to be a &s;tudent at Athens; the manner and circum&s;tances of his conver&s;ion; his in|&s;truction under Barnabas; his bapti&s;m by the Apo&s;tle Peter, together with the various adventures of &s;ome of his neare&s;t relatives I &s;hall pa&s;s over in &s;ilence: not looking upon that &s;uppo&s;ititious piece of authority &s;ufficient to encourage a belief of the&s;e things.</P>
<P>NOR is it ab&s;olutely certain, that this is that Clement, of whom we read in the
<PB N="66" REF="012009_0075_0F89418DEC4D2020">
fourth chapter to the Philippians; though, as we know of no one under this name, to whom this text may be &s;o well applied, the conjecture in which the generality of learned writers are agreed, &s;eems no ways improbable, that he is the per&s;on there intended: e&s;pecially, con&s;idering the an|cient fathers do either expre&s;&s;ly call him the &s;cripture-Clement, or &s;o de&s;cribe him as naturally to point our thoughts to this father, rather than any other of the &s;ame name. Irenaeus &s;peaks of him as one that "had &s;een the Apo&s;tles, conver&s;ed with them, and attended on their preach|ing." Origen, Eu&s;ebius, and Jerom do all of them directly take notice of him, as the Clement "&s;poken of in &s;cripture." And if this was he, the honorable men|tion an in&s;pired pen makes of him, as "an Apo&s;tle's fellow-laborer in the go&s;pel, and one who&s;e name was in the book of life," is a very recommending cir|cum&s;tance, and cannot well fail of giv|ing us a favorable opinion of any ge|nuine writing, we may meet with under his name.</P>
<P>BUT however this be, he was a per&s;on anciently had in great veneration. Scarce
<PB N="67" REF="012009_0076_0F89418EAC00D0F8">
any of the fir&s;t fathers are more frequent|ly mentioned in antiquity, or their names remembered in higher expre&s;&s;ions of re|&s;pect and honor. Clement of Alexan|dria &s;peaks of him in the &s;tile of "an Apo&s;tle"; Origin (or Ruffin his tran&s;la|tor) calls him "the faithful Clement"; the author of "the que&s;tions and an&s;wers" a&s;cribed to Ju&s;tin Martyr, "the ble&s;&s;ed Clement;" Jerom, "an apo&s;tolical man."</P>
<P>HE is &s;aid to have been Bi&s;hop of Rome: though It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved here, we &s;hall be much mi&s;taken, if, from his being &s;poken of in the &s;tile of Bi&s;hop, we &s;hould imagine him like one of our Engli&s;h dioce&s;ans. It is indeed probable enough, the ancients, that call him Bi&s;hop, after the epi&s;copal power and grandeur had aro&s;e to &s;ome height, might, by this ap|pellation, mean &s;uch a kind of eccle&s;ia&s;tic as the Bi&s;hop was in their day. But this is no argument that he was &s;o, either in reality, or in the e&s;teem of the more pri|mitive fathers. We &s;hall afterwards &s;ee it to be the truth, that, until towards the clo&s;e of the &s;econd century, Bi&s;hops and Pre&s;byters were only different names for one and the &s;ame order of officers in the
<PB N="68" REF="012009_0077_0F89418F6B974958">
chri&s;tian church, and promi&s;cuou&s;ly u&s;ed ju&s;t in the &s;ame manner, as in the Apo&s;tles days: upon which account, when Cle|ment is &s;poken of as Bi&s;hop of Rome, it amounts to no more than if he had been called the Pa&s;tor, or one of the Pre&s;|byters of that church. Agreably Ire|naeus, in mentioning the per&s;ons that &s;ucceeded in the roman church, &s;ometimes does it under the name of Bi&s;hops, and &s;ometimes under the names of Pre&s;|byters; evidently u&s;ing the&s;e names pro|mi&s;cuou&s;ly, as &s;ignifying one and the &s;ame order of church officers. This will be fully &s;hewn in its proper place.</P>
<P>BUT though he was Bi&s;hop, or Pa&s;tor, of the church of Rome, yet the particular time of his entering upon this charge is matter of great difficulty; as is al&s;o the exact place he bears in the order of &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion: the ancient fathers being &s;o &s;trangely divided in their accounts upon this head. Tertullian derives the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion from Peter; and makes Clement his immediate &s;ucce&s;&s;or. The author of the "apo&s;tolical con&s;titutions" places at the head of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion the Apo&s;tle Paul, as well as Peter; and make Linus
<PB N="69" REF="012009_0078_0F8941911434E1D0">
to &s;ucceed Paul, and Clement Peter; but not until after the death of Linus. Irenaeus and Eu&s;ebius, be&s;ides Linus, name Anacletus before Clement; giving the order thus, Linus, Anacletus, Clement. And, after the days of Eu&s;ebius, &s;till grea|ter confu&s;ion is to be &s;een in the cata|logues of this &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. In &s;ome Ana|cletus is expunged, and Cletus placed in his room; while others retain both Cle|tus and Anacletus. And the order in which the&s;e are placed, is much varied. In &s;ome the line is &s;een running thus, Li|nus, Clement, Cletus, Anacletus. In others, Linus, Cletus, Clement, Anacle|tus. And again in others, Linus, Cle|tus, Anacletus, Clement. And agrea|bly the later Greeks (as Bi&s;hop Pear&s;on ob&s;erves from Cotelerius) do call Cle|ment, &s;ometimes the &s;econd, and &s;ome|times the third Bi&s;hop of Rome.</P>
<P>IN &s;uch confu&s;ion is the line, in one of the greate&s;t and mo&s;t celebrated chur|ches in primitive antiquity: upon which the learned Stillingfleet plea&s;antly ob&s;erves, "The &s;ucce&s;&s;ion here is as muddy as Tyber it&s;elf." Nor would the remark Dr. Cave makes upon the writers of the
<PB N="70" REF="012009_0079_0F894191AC14DDC8">
Romi&s;h church, be le&s;s pertinent, if we &s;hould apply it to tho&s;e of the Engli&s;h: "They are (&s;ays he) involved in an in|extricable labyrinth about the fir&s;t four Bi&s;hops of this (the Roman) &s;ee; &s;carce two of them, of any note, bringing in the &s;ame account." And after all that has been, or can be &s;aid, perhaps, there is no way of accommodating this matter, but by &s;uppo&s;ing Linus, Cletus, and Cle|ment to be Bi&s;hops of Rome, not &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively, but at the &s;ame time: which, though it breaks in upon the unity of the Epi&s;copate, gives no ju&s;t occa&s;ion for terror, &s;ince the old maxim, "one Bi|&s;hop one altar," does not appear to be &s;acred and inviolable, either from rea&s;on, &s;cripture, or antiquity.</P>
<P>I CANNOT help digre&s;&s;ing &s;o far here, as to in&s;ert a few words from the judici|ous Dr. Calamy.
<Q>If (&s;ays he) &s;uch con|fu&s;ion reigns here, (in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion at Rome) where one would apprehend the matter to be cleare&s;t, how weak is it to place our whole dependance on the&s;e &s;ort of tables? How poor a foun|dation do tho&s;e Gentlemen chu&s;e to build upon, who lay their main &s;tre&s;s
<PB N="71" REF="012009_0080_0F8941926C4F98F0">
on their derivation from the Roman table, in proof of their mini&s;terial au|thority? Were it not a thou&s;and times more candid, and ingenuous, to confe&s;s we are in the dark, and left at uncertain|ty, than to make pompous boa&s;ts, the ground of which examined, vani&s;h from under us? The&s;e &s;ort of pretences to apo&s;tolical right, and apo&s;tolical tradi|tion, backed with the tables of &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion, in the &s;everal churches, make, I confe&s;s, a mighty noi&s;e, and may dazzle the eyes of the weak, and pa&s;s for a ju&s;tification with tho&s;e that have the civil authority on their &s;ide, which may &s;eem to give them validity: but they di&s;appear, whenever they are exa|mined in cold blood, and viewed na|ked as they are them&s;elves. When we make the be&s;t of them we can, Eu&s;ebius is the main author that we have to depend on for the credit of the&s;e tables. And his account of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, in the &s;everal churches, is made up mo&s;tly of conjectures at three hundred years di&s;tance from apo&s;to|lical times, vouched by uncertain au|thors. And where he has left vacan|cies, Nicephorus Calli&s;tus, and Simeon
<PB N="72" REF="012009_0081_0F8941932C58D820">
the Metaphra&s;t, and other &s;uch hi&s;tori|cal tinkers, as Bi&s;hop Stillingfleet plea|&s;antly calls them, have taken effectual care to fill them up.&mdash;He that from the blind, broken, and uncertain ta|bles of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, that are tran&s;mitted to us in the records of antiquity, can infer the nece&s;&s;ity of epi&s;copal, and the invalidity of pre&s;byterian ordination, mu&s;t either have a &s;trong faith, or a predominant fancy. If they cannot be cleared, it is vain to argue from them: but if they can, they will &s;erve us as much as they will them.</Q>
But to return.</P>
<P>BEING Bi&s;hop of Rome, he was a con|&s;tant, laborious preacher of the word, and di&s;pen&s;er of go&s;pel ordinances to that church. For this is the mo&s;t ju&s;t and true idea of a faithful Bi&s;hop or Pa&s;tor in primitive times. The name Bi&s;hop was not then looked upon &s;o much a ti|tle of honor, as implying in it great watch|fulne&s;s, labor and pains: and this, not in "in&s;pecting and governing inferior clergymen," but in "feeding the flock of Chri&s;t" with the word and &s;acraments. Nor is there a fact more unque&s;tionably
<PB N="73" REF="012009_0082_0F894193ED742778">
clear, from the whole &s;train of primitive an|tiquity, than that it was the &s;tated, known, perpetual employment of all that were Bi&s;hops, to exerci&s;e them&s;elves chiefly in this work. And this true &s;cripture no|tion of the work of a Bi&s;hop, was &s;o ge|nerally prevalent, even after the di&s;tinc|tion between Bi&s;hop and Pre&s;byter took place, that the fourth council of Car|thage came into &s;uch a decree as that, "the Bi&s;hop &s;hall wholly occupy him&s;elf in reading, and praying, and preach|ing the word." But the reader that has a mind to &s;ee this matter indi&s;putably cleared up, has it done ready to his hand by that wonder of learning, the great Jame&s;on, in his "Nazianzeni Querela" and his "Cyprianus I&s;otimus".</P>
<P>It is common in modern authors to read of this Clement as bani&s;hed from his church, and at la&s;t dying a mar|tyr for the cau&s;e of Chri&s;t: though the&s;e things, to &s;ay the lea&s;t, are mat|ters of great uncertainty. None of the fathers of the three fir&s;t centuries, that I can find, make mention of him as an exile, or martyr. And what is pretty extraordinary, Eu&s;ebius, who is common|ly very particular in the&s;e ca&s;es, is whol|ly &s;ilent upon this head. If we may de|pend
<PB N="74" REF="012009_0083_0F894194AC4A16C8">
on the credit of Cotelerius, Ruffin, who lived in latter end of the fourth cen|tury, is the fir&s;t that &s;peaks of him as ho|nored with martyrdom. After him in|deed Simeon Metaphra&s;tes has exhibited to the world a mo&s;t particular and for|mal account of his "bani&s;hment to Cher|&s;on to dig in the marble quarries and la|bor in the mines; and afterwards of his being carried and thrown into the bottom of the &s;ea." St. Ephraem al&s;o, Bi&s;hop of Cher|&s;on, relates &s;everal very extraordinary mira|cles, that followed upon his being then put to death: but the&s;e are authors too much given to the romantic &s;train to place any dependance on; e&s;pecially in matters &s;o di&s;tant from their own times, about which the fir&s;t fathers are wholly &s;ilent. Nor is it much to the honor of the learned, and otherwi&s;e valuable, Dr. Cave, that he takes &s;o much notice, with &s;eeming faith, of the&s;e and &s;uch like plainly fabu|lous relations: though I could wi&s;h, he he had not, upon this account, been quite &s;o &s;everely cen&s;ured by my Lord Barring|ton, when he &s;ays of him, "that he has little that is not common and obvious, be|&s;ides &s;ome idle and legendary &s;tories, with which he abounds.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="012009_0084_0F8941956D898C08">BUT whatever was the manner of his death, Eu&s;ebius places it in the third of Trajan, that is, in the year of our Lord one hundred, after he had been Bi&s;hop of Rome nine years: which, whether it be the true account, I leave to others to determine.</P>
<P>THE writings that go under the name of this Clement are many, and may be di&s;tingui&s;h'd into GENUINE, DOUBTFUL, and SUPPOSITITIOUS.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="category of writings">
<HEAD>GENUINE.</HEAD>
<P>IN this rank is placed that excellent epi&s;tle to the Corinthians, concerning which the great Du-pin has dropped that remark, "next to the holy &s;cripture, it is, in my opinion, one of the mo&s;t eminent re|cords of antiquity." It was certainly &s;o accounted by the primitive fathers; who &s;carce mention it without &s;ome epithet of honor. It is called by Irenaeus (as Dr. Cave tran&s;lates the phra&s;e) "the mo&s;t excellent and ab&s;olute writing;" by Eu|&s;ebius "the truly great and admirable epi&s;tle:" and what the &s;ame author adds, may further a&s;&s;ure us of its high va|lue
<PB N="76" REF="012009_0085_0F8941962C297738">
in ancient times."; this epi&s;tle we have known to have been publicly read in many churches, both of old, and among our&s;elves al&s;o." Nor is it unwor|thy ob&s;ervation, that the only copy of this epi&s;tle, known in the world, was found written in the &s;ame volume with the &s;a|cred books of the new-te&s;tament: to which happy circum&s;tance we may a&s;cribe it, that we are favored with it, after it had been bewailed as lo&s;t for many ages.</P>
<P>THE manner of its di&s;covery and pub|lication was thus.&mdash;When Cyrill, Pa|triarch of Con&s;tantinople, returned from his Alexandrian &s;eat in Egypt, he brought with him a large collection of books; among which was an ancient copy of the old and new-te&s;tament, wrote by the hand of Thecla, a noble Egyptian virgin, about the time of the fir&s;t nicene coun|cil. This he &s;ent as a pre&s;ent to King Charles the fir&s;t, by Sir Thomas Roe, his Maje&s;ty's then Emba&s;&s;ador at the Otto|man court, upon his return into England. At the end of this copy was added this epi&s;tle of Clement, wrote by the &s;ame hand; though &s;omething broken and de|faced:
<PB N="77" REF="012009_0086_0F894196EC3E1878">
which, when the learned Patrick Young, his Maje&s;ty's library-keeper, had di&s;covered, he was commanded by the King, to make it public; which he ac|cordingly did at Oxford, in the year 1633, with a latin tran&s;lation, and learn|ed notes.</P>
<P>THE occa&s;ion of Clement's writing this epi&s;tle, we may learn from Irenaeus, who &s;ays, "In the days of Clement, the church of Rome wrote a very pathetical letter [they are &s;aid to have wrote it, though it was penned by Clement, be|cau&s;e it was wrote and &s;ent in their name] to re&s;tore them to peace." Eu&s;ebius ex|hibits the like te&s;timony, when he tells us, "that Clement wrote this epi&s;tle from Rome to Corinth, when &s;edition was rai&s;ed among the Corinthians." He adds a few words after, "that there was, at that time, a &s;edition among the Co|rinthians, Hege&s;ippus is a witne&s;s. Nor can any one that reads this epi&s;tle be at a lo&s;s as to the truth of this. It is plain, through the whole of it, there was a &s;hame|ful di&s;turbance in the church; and this chief|ly again&s;t its Pre&s;byters: &s;ome of the peo|ple being vainly conceited of their &s;pi|ritual
<PB N="78" REF="012009_0087_0F894197AD716088">
gifts, and therefore ri&s;ing up again&s;t their guides and teachers. Now, to heal this difference, and re&s;tore peace and good order, this epi&s;tle was principally de&s;ign|ed; and to this end it is admirably well adapted: being wrote in a plain and un|affected &s;tile; yet with great &s;trength and per&s;picuity, and evidently breathing the true &s;pirit and genius of the apo&s;tolic age.</P>
<P>THE epi&s;tle is wrote in the name of the church of Rome to the church of Co|rinth: upon which a noted author per|tinently remarks, "Had he (Clement) known him&s;elf to be the infallible judge of controver&s;ies, to who&s;e &s;entence the whole chri&s;tian world was bound to &s;tand, inve&s;ted with a &s;upreme, unaccountable power, from which there lay no appeal, we might have expected to hear him ar|gue at another rate." And as there is no mention in this epi&s;tle of any &s;ingle per|&s;on, as the head and Governor of the Co|rinthian church, I cannot forbear adding another remark, which &s;eems full as na|tural; namely, That if there had been, at that time, at the head of this church, an eccle&s;ia&s;tical officer, in any mea&s;ure, re&s;embling one of our modern Bi&s;hops,
<PB N="79" REF="012009_0088_0F8941986C1F3A20">
it is altogether unaccountable, how both Clement and the church of Rome &s;hould treat him with &s;uch neglect, as to be to|tally &s;ilent about him. It would certain|ly look &s;trange, and be re&s;ented ill, if one of our pre&s;ent Bi&s;hops &s;hould be &s;o &s;hamefully overlooked; his church com|plained of, rebuked, exhorted, and direct|ed to a proper method of peace: and all, without referring the matter to the Bi|&s;hop, or indeed taking the lea&s;t notice of him.&mdash;But of this we may hear more afterwards.</P>
<P>THE exact time, when this epi&s;tle was wrote, is not ea&s;y to be &s;tated; as we may be fully &s;atisfied from the di&s;agree|ment of the mo&s;t learned writers on this head. Mr. Young's thought is, that it was wrote about two years before his death, in the time that he &s;uppo&s;es him to be under bani&s;hment. Dr. Cave fixes the period a few years &s;ooner, a little af|ter the Diocle&s;ian per&s;ecution. Vende|linus places it in the year 95, when he apprehends this per&s;ecution was at its heighth. Cotelerius agrees with him as to the year, but rather thinks the per&s;e|cution was drawing to an end. But the
<PB N="80" REF="012009_0089_0F89419970C62CF0">
conjecture of Grotius, Dodwell, Arch-Bi&s;hop Wake, and &s;ome others, makes it to have been wrote much &s;ooner; be|tween the latter end of Nero's reign, and the de&s;truction of Jeru&s;alem, that is, between the years 64 and 70; which they very much ground on that pa&s;&s;age in the epi&s;tle, where they &s;uppo&s;e the Jewi&s;h prie&s;t|hood and Levitical mini&s;trations are &s;po|ken of as yet continuing.&mdash;But as it would be a going too far out of my way to con|&s;ider the particular rea&s;ons, on which the&s;e conjectures are built, I have barely referred to them, without pretending to &s;ay which are mo&s;t probable: but leaving it to the reader to examine the matter, and determine as he &s;ees fit:</P>
<P>THE only colour of an objection again&s;t the genuine&s;s of this epi&s;tle, is taken from the "fable of the phaenix," which Cle|ment particularly relates, and then u&s;es to repre&s;ent the credibility of the doctrine of the re&s;urrection. But it is not wor|thy of much notice. This was a &s;tory, however ridiculous, generally believed in that day, by the learned as well as un|learned, both Jews and Gentiles. And as the account of that "bird's reviving out

<P>GROTIUS's thoughts concerning this epi&s;tle, in his letter to Bignorius, are worth tran&s;cribing here. "I have (&s;ays he) read it over and over again, with the utmo&s;t care and diligence, and cannot think any other, than that it is the &s;ame epi&s;tle which Photius read: in who&s;e day, &s;ince it was in being, it is not wonderful, it has been pre&s;erved to our's, among the &s;acred writings. Neither &s;ee I any rea&s;on, ei|ther why the epi&s;tle which Photius read,

&s;hould not be the &s;ame which Jerom had, and before him Clement of Alexan|dria, and Irenaeus, yet nearer to the time of Clement of Rome: or why we &s;hould a&s;cribe it to any other, than Clement of Rome him&s;elf; &s;ince this has been hand|ed down to us, with &s;o great and univer|&s;al con&s;ent." To which I would only add, there is no one ancient piece, we have greater rea&s;on, both from its internal cha|racter, and external evidence, to depend upon as genuine. It is perhaps the mo&s;t frequently quoted, by the more primi|tive Fathers, of any unin&s;pired book; between all which quotations, and the pre&s;ent copy of this epi&s;tle, there is a won|derful agreement. And it carries in it none of tho&s;e marks of impo&s;tor that are to be met with, in &s;ome other pieces, and the&s;e too, palmed upon even this ve|ry Clement: but every thing is delivered both as to matter, and manner, as might be expected from one that lived in the apo&s;tolic age, and was a worthy faithful laborer in the vineyard of Chri&s;t.</P>

<P>THE pieces of this &s;ort, a&s;cribed to Clement, as their author, or the penman of others, are the "apo&s;tolical con&s;titu|tions," the "apo&s;tolical canons," the

<P>AS to the con&s;titutions; Mr. Whi&s;ton, the late&s;t patron of them, has given them the mo&s;t &s;acred character; pre|tending, that they are the work of even the whole body of the Apo&s;tles, and pen|ned by Clement as their amanuen&s;is: than which, perhaps, there never was an opinion attended with more, or greater ab&s;urdities. It is obvious to all, in any mea&s;ure, ver&s;ed in the ancient wri|tings, that there is a total &s;ilence of all primitive antiquity about the&s;e con&s;titu|tions. And however Mr. Whi&s;ton's authorities out of the fathers have &s;wel|led even into a volume, yet that they are only a va&s;t heap of mi&s;applications is &s;o evident, that no one, &s;o far as I can learn, has ever thought it worth while to be at the pains to take them out of that &s;trangly fal&s;e light, in which he has placed them: nor is there any need of it, there being enough in the books them|&s;elves to make it clearly evident, that no one of the apo&s;tles had any hand in writ|ing them; yea, that they never were in

being, at lea&s;t as we now have them, un|til the church of Chri&s;t was gone far in|to corruption and degeneracy. A few of tho&s;e many things, which are open to every one's ob&s;ervation, upon the bare reading of them, and that are &s;ufficient indications of this, I &s;hall here in&s;ert.</P>
<P>THE manner in which they &s;peak of Bi&s;hops is very extraordinary. They repre&s;ent them as "bearing the character of God among men;" as "&s;et over all men, Prie&s;ts, Kings, Princes, fathers, &s;ons, ma&s;ters, and all that are &s;ubject to them." They command them to "judge with like authority as God him&s;elf." They call the Bi&s;hop, "the mini&s;ter of the word, the keeper of knowledge, the me|diator between God and his people in re|ligious wor&s;hip, the ma&s;ter of piety, next unto God, the chri&s;tian's father, his Prince, Governor, King, Potentate;" and declare, that he is to be "honor'd next to God as an earthly God." They &s;peak of Bi&s;hops, as tho&s;e that are to be "venerated and honoured with all kind of honor;" as tho&s;e who have "received from God the power of life and death, in judging &s;inners, and condemning them to eter|nal
<PB N="86" REF="012009_0095_0F89419E6C120F08">
flames, and ab&s;olving tho&s;e who are converted." They exhort the people to "reverence their Bi&s;hops as Kings, and to honor them as their Lord."</P>
<P>THIS is a ta&s;te of the &s;pirit, and &s;tile, in which Bi&s;hops are here &s;poken of; between which, and the &s;tile and &s;pirit of the truly apo&s;tolical writings, upon the &s;ame &s;ubject, there cannot be a greater contrariety. Let a man read, over and over again, the genuine writings of the apo&s;tles, and he &s;hall ever find what they &s;ay concerning Bi&s;hops, to be delivered in plain &s;imple language, per|fectly &s;uited to the &s;piritual nature of that kingdom of Chri&s;t, in which they are of|ficers: whereas, the&s;e "con&s;titutions" &s;o &s;trangely differ from the apo&s;tolic genius, that, if the writings of the mo&s;t corrupt ages be looked into, we &s;hall not be able to find in them any expre&s;&s;ions, more unboundedly aggrandi&s;ing Bi&s;hops, and claiming for them higher degrees of ho|nor and reverence.</P>
<P>AND if we turn to the epi&s;tle of Cle|ment, the pretended amanuen&s;is of the Apo&s;tles, we &s;hall find as great a di&s;&s;o|nancy

between that, and the&s;e con&s;titu|tions: which is truly wonderful, if he had &s;uch an intimate acquaintance with them, as he mu&s;t have had, if he was the penman of them. Nor can it, in any ra|tional way, be accounted for, that, in wri|ting to the Corinthians, he &s;hould whol|ly pa&s;s by this mo&s;t valuable and canoni|cal part of &s;acred &s;cripture, (as it mu&s;t certainly be, if, as is &s;aid, it was compo|&s;ed by the whole body of Apo&s;tles) which yet he does; and this, when it was far better adapted to an&s;wer the de&s;ign of his "epi&s;tle," than all the other books of the new-te&s;tament put together. For here, the boundaries, not only between Bi|&s;hops and Pre&s;byters, but between Pre&s;|byters and Laics, are mo&s;t punctually fixed; their duty to them pre&s;cribed; their obedience &s;ecured; and, in a word, the whole controver&s;y among the Corin|thians, the occa&s;ion of Clement's writing to them, intirely &s;ettled. And yet, he takes not the lea&s;t notice of the&s;e "con|&s;titutions," though, from the mouth of the Apo&s;tles, he had penned them; while&punc; at the &s;ame time, he makes great u&s;e of the books both of the old and new-te&s;ta|ment, to fetch in arguments to his pur|po&s;e. But to proceed.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="012009_0097_0F89419FED741FA8">IN the&s;e "con&s;titutions," we have forms of prayer pre&s;cribed for a great va|riety of occa&s;ions: particularly for both &s;acraments, "bapti&s;m and the Lord's &s;upper;" for the "ordination of Bi&s;hops, Pre&s;byters, Deacons, Readers, Singers," and &s;o on. But that the&s;e were, any of them, ever u&s;ed in the primitive church, there are no foot&s;teps in antiquity: nor is there the lea&s;t reference made to them, by any truly ancient Father, upon any occa&s;ion: which is altogether unaccoun|table, if, as is pretended, they were com|po&s;ed, even by the whole body of Apo&s;|tles; and this, purpo&s;ely for the u&s;e of the chri&s;tian church.</P>
<P>WE here read of the u&s;e of "oyl in bapti&s;m;" nor is it allowed to be valid without a prayer for the efficacy of it on the bapti&s;ed per&s;on: and he is repre|&s;ented, without this prayer, as "de|&s;cending into the water to no better pur|po&s;e than a meer Jew;" and as "wa&s;hing off the defilements of his body, but not of his &s;oul."</P>
<P>WE have here pre&s;cribed an "office for the dead;" in which &s;upplication is

<P>WE are here commanded to attend "prayer at church," not only daily, but no le&s;s than "&s;ix times a day;" the particular &s;ea&s;ons for which, toge|ther with the trifling rea&s;ons on which they are grounded, are all particularly &s;pecified.</P>
<P>PARTICULAR care is here taken about the "form and &s;ituation of churches;" an appointment made, that they &s;hall be "oblong and facing the ea&s;t." Mag|nificence in churches is al&s;o commanded, the "Bi&s;hops throne" adju&s;ted, the place where he is to &s;tand appointed, namely, "the altar;" where he mu&s;t appear clothed with a "&s;hining &s;plendid ve&s;t|ment;" and before he begins prayer, he is ordered, in the &s;ight of all the people, "to make upon his forehead the &s;ign of the cro&s;s." The Deacons are command|ed to wait on each &s;ide of the altar, with a "fan in their hands made of thin membranes, or the feathers of a peacock,
<PB N="90" REF="012009_0099_0F894086AF990348">
or of fine cloth, to drive away the &s;mall animals from the &s;acramental cups." A very minute account is al&s;o exhibited of "places to &s;it in" in churches, and the "junior ordered to be turned of his place," if he does not yield it to a "more honorable &s;tranger;" together with other like in&s;tances of ceremony and good manners.</P>
<P>WE are here directed to "ob&s;erve days in honor to decea&s;ed &s;aints;" to accom|pany "their funerals with &s;inging," and to "a&s;&s;emble in the dormitories of the martyrs, and there to celebrate the holy euchari&s;t."</P>
<P>PARTICULAR mention is here made of "Sub-deacons, Readers, Singers, Con|fe&s;&s;ors, Porters, Mini&s;ters, Virgins, Ex|erci&s;ts," as BEARING OFFICE in the church. We read al&s;o of "Energumens, Cate|chumens," together with a great num|ber of "fa&s;ts and fea&s;ts," and a deal more &s;uch trumpery, which was ab&s;o|&s;olutely unknown in the apo&s;tolic age; but vi&s;ible enough in the church, in after days, when &s;he had become &s;uper|&s;titious and corrupt.

now particularly and largely have &s;hewn, but that I mu&s;t have taken con&s;iderable pains, in my own apprehen&s;ion, to little purpo&s;e; not doubting, but the bare nar|rative of the above articles will be thought by mo&s;t, a full ju&s;tification of tho&s;e, who di&s;card all pretence to the&s;e books, as apo&s;tolically compo&s;ed.</P>
<P>THIS opinion then being thrown a&s;ide, it is not ea&s;y to conceive of the&s;e "con|&s;titutions" in their pre&s;ent form, as any other, than the work of &s;ome very bold and impudent impo&s;tor; &s;ince he per&s;onates the Apo&s;tles with all freedom; &s;peaking in the name, &s;ometimes of one, &s;ometimes of another, and &s;ometimes of them all; with the greate&s;t &s;olemnity and formali|ty commanding this thing, and prohibit|ing another. In&s;tances of this are &s;o fre|quently to be met with, that it is needle&s;s to adduce any.

<P>AS to the time in which the&s;e books may be &s;uppo&s;ed to come abroad in the world, I know of none (tho&s;e few excep|ted who plead for them as penned by

For, &s;hould it be even allowed, that they were then in being, it is ab&s;olutely certain, they are not NOW, as they mu&s;t have been THEN. And, unle&s;s &s;ome way could be pointed out (which has never yet been done) to di&s;tingui&s;h the ORIGINAL CONTENTS, from the MULTIPLICITY OF CORRUPTIONS that have crept into them, they can be of no real &s;ervice; as there is no knowing what is GENUINE, and what the WORK of &s;en&s;ele&s;s and knavi&s;h INTERPOLAORTS.</NOTE> But whether tho&s;e, who thus fix the time, are in the right; or others, who bring it down to the fourth or fifth century, I &s;hall not di&s;pute.

<P>MR. Whi&s;ton pretends the &s;ame of the "canons" that he does of the con&s;titu|tions; that they were wrote by Clement, as the work of the whole apo&s;tolic body: but there does not appear any rea&s;on, why the &s;ame judgment &s;hould not be pa&s;&s;ed

upon them, that we have given of the con|&s;titutions, in point of their being apo&s;to|lically compo&s;ed. As for my&s;elf, nothing more was needful to convince me of this, after I had once read them: &s;o many of them being either trifling in them&s;elves, or incon&s;i&s;tent with the truly apo&s;tolical writings, or containing &s;uch things as were not known in the church until ages after the apo&s;tles.

<P>CAN. II. "If any Bi&s;hop or Pre&s;byter, be&s;ides what our Lord has appointed for &s;acrifice, &s;hall offer upon the altar other things; as honey, or milk, or cyder in|&s;tead of wine, or things made by the confectioner, or birds, or animals, or pul&s;e: let him be depo&s;ed. Excepting ears of corn, or grapes, it is not lawful to offer any thing upon the altar, &s;ave only oyl for the holy lamp, and incen&s;e of thyme in divine oblation." Tho&s;e who are in the lea&s;t acquainted with the writings of the apo&s;tolic age, and the af|ter corrupt ages of the church, can be at no lo&s;s to determine, in which of the&s;e ages, it is mo&s;t likely, this canon &s;hould

And the curious reader, that will be at the pains to run over the learn|ed Dodwell's "book of incen&s;e," cannot well help being &s;atisfied, particularly as to the article of offering incen&s;e, that it was ab&s;olutely unknown in the church, for &s;ome ages after the death of the Apo&s;tles.</P>
<P>CAN. V. "If any Bi&s;hop, Pre&s;byter, or Deacon, &s;hall celebrate with the Jews, the holy day of ea&s;ter before the vernal aequinox, let him be depo&s;ed." The controver&s;y between the ea&s;tern and we&s;|tern churches, about the time of keeping ea&s;ter, that happened in the &s;econd cen|tury, long after the death of the Apo&s;tles, might, by this canon, have been &s;ettled: and yet, in the whole management of this di&s;pute, (which was prodigiou&s;ly fierce) it was never once appealed to, nor the lea&s;t hint given, by either party, as if any &s;uch canon was in being: which is certain|ly a very &s;trange thing, if, before this di&s;|pute, this cannon had been made, and committed to writing by direction from the Apo&s;tles: e&s;pecially con&s;idering, the chief managers of this di&s;pute were the Pa&s;tors of the &s;everal churches, the mo&s;t

Who the author of the&s;e canons was, is a matter of the greate&s;t uncertainty. But whether he was an impo&s;tor, that de&s;ign|ed to impo&s;e upon the world, by putting them forth under the name of the Apo&s;|tles: or whether they are only the de|crees of ancient councils collected toge|ther in this form, by &s;ome per&s;on or per|&s;ons of hone&s;t intention; and &s;tiled apo&s;|tolical, not as if they had been made by the Apo&s;tles, but as containing things, in their apprehen&s;ion, con&s;onant to the rules delivered by the Apo&s;tles; or as made up of u&s;ages and traditions &s;uppo&s;ed, to be handed down from them: I &s;ay, whether of the&s;e opinions are the true&s;t, I &s;hall not at pre&s;ent debate.

opinion, that they ought to be placed in the third century. But in&s;tead of examining the arguments of the&s;e au|thors to know which are in the right, I &s;hall rather ob&s;erve concerning both the apo&s;tolical con&s;titutions, and canons, as a conclu&s;ion of what I &s;hall offer about them,</P>
<P>THAT however tho&s;e learned writers, who have given the world their thoughts about the&s;e books, may differ in matters of &s;maller importance; as the time, man|ner, and occa&s;ion of their being wrote; yet, with great unanimity, they reject them as the work of in&s;pired Apo&s;tles. And indeed, Mr. Whi&s;ton (depending on the credit of Dr. Smallbroke) is the fir&s;t per&s;on, either ancient or modern, &s;o far as we are informed by eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;|tory, that ever had this opinion of them:
<Q>Even Bovius, and Turrianus, (to u&s;e the language of that author) who fir&s;t recommended the con&s;titutions to the learned world, how vainly &s;oever they &s;pent their time in writing forced and unnatural apologies for them, were not &s;o fond of novelty, as to &s;up|po&s;e they were truly apo&s;tolical, and
<PB N="99" REF="012009_0108_0F89408E2D90EEA8">
the product of divine in&s;piration. Much le&s;s did they ever dream of &s;o high a degree of in&s;piration, as renders them (according to Mr. Whi&s;ton) more &s;acred than the authentic go&s;pels them|&s;elves. All that they pretended to a&s;|&s;ert was, that Clemens Romanus had collected &s;ome apo&s;tolical traditions, which he formed into the eight books of con&s;titutions, then retrieved and publi&s;hed by them. They, therefore, agreably to their hypothe&s;is, weak and precarious as it was, labored to e&s;tabli&s;h the antiquity of the con&s;ti|tutions, as a body of eccle&s;ia&s;tical di&s;|cipline; but expre&s;&s;ly di&s;claimed all preten&s;ions to divine authority, or to their being a &s;acred rule of life and manners.</Q>
He goes on in a man|ner that I &s;hall think worth tran&s;|cribing:
<Q>Indeed their principal de|&s;ign was to oppo&s;e tho&s;e of the re|formation by them. And that it was &s;o, both tho&s;e warm patrons of the con|&s;titutions very frankly acknowledge. Bovius, who tran&s;lated them fir&s;t into latin, and commented upon them, de|dicated his work to the Pope's legates that pre&s;ided in the council of Trent:

In the epi&s;tle dedicatory to whom, he acquaints us, that, upon a recital of &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages of the clementine con|&s;titutions, at a meeting of the fathers of the council of Trent, tho&s;e pa&s;|&s;ages were thought &s;o very &s;erviceable to what was there tran&s;acting in that &s;y|nod, as to give the fir&s;t hint to the publica|tion of the whole body of the con&s;tituti|ons. After which, Bovius a&s;&s;erts, that there is &s;carce any thing that is oppo&s;ed by the Heretics, that is, Prote&s;tants, as crept into the church by error and &s;uper|&s;tition, but may be defended by the authority of the&s;e con&s;titutions, and &s;hewn to be of primitive antiquity. Turrianus, likewi&s;e, who made the&s;e con&s;titutions a con&s;iderable part of his &s;tudies, a&s;&s;ures us, that they were thought very beneficial to the church, that is, the church of Rome, by the cen&s;ors of books in the council of Trent; and that their mo&s;t grave and weighty judgment of them was &s;ealed, and laid up at Rome, in the public records of the inqui&s;ition. Again, he affirms, that nothing of antiquity could be publi&s;hed more proper for that age, and better adapted to the confutation
<PB N="101" REF="012009_0110_0F89408FADC934E8">
of tho&s;e innovators, the Prote&s;tants.</Q>
He adds,
<Q>That the&s;e books were pro|videntially publi&s;hed in that age, when there was the greate&s;t occa&s;ion for them, as witne&s;&s;es again&s;t tho&s;e of the reformation: (at whom he rails very plentifully) and that it &s;eemed, nothing more was either wanting, or could be expected for their convicti|on. That the&s;e books were &s;ent by God to triumph over the&s;e Prote&s;|tants, and to &s;hew the world how ju&s;t|ly they were condemned in the coun|cil of Trent.</Q></P>
<P>DR. Smallbroke adds, the rea&s;on that he tran&s;cribed the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages from Bovius and Turrianus was,
<Q>That the reader might be rightly informed of the avow|ed de&s;ign of publi&s;hing the clementine con&s;titutions, even the confutation of the reformed religion,</Q>
And I have thus tran&s;cribed the pa&s;&s;ages from him, becau&s;e he &s;tiles him&s;elf "Canon-Re&s;i|dentiary of Hereford, Trea&s;urer of the church of Landaff, and Chaplain to his Grace, the Lord Arch-Bi&s;hop of Can|terbury."</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="012009_0111_0F8940906F5C1D70">THE next piece, that pre&s;ents it&s;elf under the name of Clement, is the "re|cognitions," as in the tran&s;lation of Ruf|fin. But it is &s;o empty of every thing &s;avoring of the &s;implicity of the fir&s;t and pure ages of chri&s;tianity, and &s;o full of fable, and feigned conferences about fate, and the influence of the &s;tars, and hea|venly con&s;tellations, and &s;uch like ridi|culous &s;tuff, that it is univer&s;ally placed below the time of Clement, as altogether unworthy of him.</P>
<P>AND the &s;ame may be &s;aid of the other writings, we have mentioned under the head of &s;uppo&s;ititious, if indeed they may be allowed to be called different ones. The "clementines" are thought, by &s;ome, to be that "other edition of the recog|nitions," Ruffin mentions in his preface to Gaudentius, prefixed to the recogni|tions he made a ver&s;ion of: &s;ince they &s;o exactly agree with the character he there gives of them, differing in &s;ome things from that he tran&s;lated, but the &s;ame in many. And for the "epitome of the acts of Peter," Dr. Cave calls it "a third edition of the recognitions," or rather an "ab&s;tract of both the recog|nitions

and clementines," though keep|ing more clo&s;ely to the latter. But whe|ther the&s;e are different compo&s;itions, or only one and the &s;ame piece, &s;omething varied and differently modelled, it mat|ters not; &s;o long as we have the con|currence of the main body of the learned world in throwing them a&s;ide as evident|ly &s;uppo&s;ititious.</P>

<P>THESE pa&s;&s;ages, it is pleaded, afford clear evidence, that there was, in the days of Clement, a di&s;tinction between Bi&s;hops and Pre&s;byters. Being &s;ubject, <HI>&ecirc;goumenois um&ocirc;n,</HI> that is, &s;ay they, to your eccle&s;ia&s;tical rulers; by whom they con|clude are meant Bi&s;hops: and this, as of|ficers di&s;tinct from Pre&s;byters; becau&s;e it follows, paying due honor <HI>tois par umin Pre&s;buterois</HI>; by whom, they &s;up|po&s;e, we are to under&s;tand, not aged men, but tho&s;e officers in the church, called Pre&s;byters.</P>
<P>NOW, in order to &s;how the invalidity of this plea, I have no need to go into the opinion of the learned Salma&s;ius, and Burton, who un&s;ter&s;tand by the&s;e <HI>&ecirc;gou|menoi,</HI> not eccle&s;ia&s;tical, but civil rulers; which opinion they &s;trengthen by ob|&s;erving,

that this word is &s;everal times u&s;ed in this epi&s;tle; but always as &s;ig|nifying tho&s;e, who were civil rulers. The places referred to by Salma&s;ius are five; and except tho&s;e under con&s;ideration, they are all, in which it is u&s;ed; and it is u&s;ed in them with reference to civil officers. But this notwith&s;tanding, as the word may, with propriety, be applied to eccle&s;ia&s;tical rulers, and is frequently applied to them in the &s;acred books; and as there is no hint given, any where in Clement's epi&s;tle, as if the Corinthi|ans were blameable for their di&s;obedience to their civil rulers; and its chief de&s;ign is to teach them a &s;utable conduct, not towards tho&s;e in the &s;tate, but in the church, that were &s;et over them: I &s;ay con&s;idering the&s;e things, I am willing to allow, that, by the&s;e rulers, we are to under&s;tand, not tho&s;e of the civil, but eccle&s;ia&s;tical order: but mu&s;t &s;ay, at the &s;ame time, that we have abundant rea&s;on to conclude, they were Pre&s;byters, and not Bi&s;hops; unle&s;s we take Bi|&s;hop and Pre&s;byter, to be only different words for the &s;ame officer. For let it be ob&s;erved.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="012009_0127_0F89409DEDA56CC0">THERE was, at this time, a plurality of the&s;e rulers in the church of Corinth; as is plain from the word, [<HI>&ecirc;goumenois</HI>] which is of a plural &s;ignification. Now, it is certain, that there was a plurality of Pre&s;byters in this church; and Pre&s;by|ters too, who had been "&s;et over them," to whom they were commanded to "be in SUBJECTION." Says Clement, [<HI>upo|tag&ecirc;te tois Pre&s;buterois</HI>] "Be ye &s;ubject to your Pre&s;byters." And it is ob&s;ervable, the &s;ame word, here joned with Pre&s;|byters, requiring the &s;ubjection of the Corinthian church to them, is joined al&s;o with the word, <HI>&ecirc;goumenois,</HI> be&s;peak|ing the &s;ame &s;ubjection. The interpre|tation is therefore &s;mooth, natural, and con&s;i&s;tent with the current &s;train of the whole epi&s;tle, while by the&s;e <HI>&ecirc;goumenois</HI> we under&s;tand the Pre&s;byters of the church; e&s;pecially, if it be further con|&s;idered, that Pre&s;byter-Bi&s;hops are the highe&s;t eccle&s;ia&s;tical rulers any where men|tioned by Clement: nor is his epi&s;tle at all acquainted with Bi&s;hops, only as they mean officers in the church, preci&s;ely of the &s;ame rank with the Pre&s;byters of it.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="012009_0128_0F89409EAE5A7480">BESIDES, it may be worth a remark, the word <HI>&ecirc;goumenoi</HI> is one of the names u&s;ed in &s;cripture to point out Pre&s;byters, or, in other words, tho&s;e officers in the chri&s;tian church, that are el&s;ewhere, in the &s;acred writings, promi&s;cuou&s;ly and in|differently called either Bi&s;hops, or Pre&s;by|ters. Thus in the epi&s;tle to the Hebrews, when they are minded of their duty to their eccle&s;ia&s;tical guides, or rulers, it is expre&s;&s;ed after that manner, "Remem|ber [<HI>t&ocirc;n &ecirc;goumen&ocirc;n um&ocirc;n</HI>] them which have the rule over you, and have &s;poken to you the word of God." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. xiii.7.</NOTE> And a few ver&s;es below, "obey [<HI>tois &ecirc;goumenois um&ocirc;n</HI>] all them that have the rule over you." And the epi&s;tle concludes in that &s;tile, "&s;alute [<HI>pantas tous &ecirc;goume|nous um&ocirc;n</HI>] them that have the rule over you." And this u&s;e of the word, in this epi&s;tle, is the rather to be regard|ed, becau&s;e Eu&s;ebius and Jerom &s;peak, both of them, of &s;o great an affinity, in many things, both as to words and mat|ter, between this and the epi&s;tle of Cle|ment, that it was from thence thought, that Clement was, at lea&s;t, the tran&s;lator of
<PB N="120" REF="012009_0129_0F89409F6DE4A840">
the epi&s;tle to the Hebrews. And cri|ticks make u&s;e of it as a &s;trong argu|ment in proof of the genuinene&s;s of the pre&s;ent copy of Clement's epi&s;tle, that it is found to agree &s;o well with this ob&s;er|vation of Eu&s;ebius and Jerom.</P>
<P>BUT if, with the Epi&s;copalians, we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e <HI>&ecirc;goumenoi</HI> mean Bi|&s;hops, in di&s;tinction from Pre&s;byters; will it not follow, as an inevitable con&s;e|quence, that there was in the church of Corinth, at the &s;ame time, a plurali|ty of Bi&s;hops? It is ob&s;ervable, the word is <HI>&ecirc;goumenois,</HI> not in the &s;ingular, but plu|ral number: which can never be recon|ciled with the doctrine of one "Bi&s;hop in a church, as the center of unity." The dilemma here is plain: either the&s;e <HI>&ecirc;gou|menoi</HI> were not Bi&s;hops in the &s;en&s;e pleaded for, or there were more of the&s;e Bi&s;hops than one, in the &s;ame church, at the &s;ame time. That is to &s;ay, either this te&s;timony from Clement mu&s;t be given up, or the old &s;acred maxim, "one Bi&s;hop one altar." But rather than part with this, I doubt not we &s;hall be left in quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of any te&s;timony whatever.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="012009_0130_0F8940A02E075340">IT will perhaps be objected again&s;t what has been offered, that the&s;e rulers are di&s;tingui&s;hued, in the pa&s;&s;ages them|selves, from Pre&s;byters; and therefore can never mean the &s;ame officers.</P>
<P>IN an&s;wer whereto, I freely acknow|ledge, the Greek words, <HI>&ecirc;goumenois,</HI> and <HI>Pre&s;buterois,</HI> are di&s;tingui&s;hed from each other; but that the word, <HI>Pre&s;buterois,</HI> means here tho&s;e officers in the church, that are called Pre&s;byters, there is no rea|&s;on to think. It is certain, this term is &s;ometimes u&s;ed in its common and un|appropriated &s;en&s;e, as &s;ignifying only aged per&s;ons. In this &s;en&s;e it is taken in 1. Tim. v. i. "Rebuke not [<HI>Pre&s;bu|ter&ocirc;</HI>] an Elder, but intreat him as a fa|ther,"&mdash;Dr. Whitby's note here is, "In the judgment of Chry&s;o&s;tom, Theodoret, Oecumenius, and Theophylact, the Elder here &s;ignifies, not a Prie&s;t, but a grave and ancient man; &s;uch being in all ages and nations &s;tiled fathers. And this &s;en&s;e, the di&s;tinction here of ages, and of &s;exes, &s;eems to plead for. For &s;o it follows, "the younger men (intreat) as brethren, the elder women as mothers," and &s;o on. In the &s;ame &s;en&s;e, this word
<PB N="122" REF="012009_0131_0F8940A0EF884620">
is to be taken in the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages of Cle|ment, and for the &s;ame rea&s;on; though much &s;trengthened by its manner of con|nection. For let it be ob&s;erved,</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, Clement is commending the Corinthians for what was FORMERLY worthy in their conduct; and, among other things, mentions it to their prai&s;e, that they "had been &s;ubject to their <HI>&ecirc;goumenois,</HI>" and had "paid due honor to their <HI>Pre&s;|byterois</HI>;" where, by <HI>Pre&s;byterois,</HI> he means, and mu&s;t mean, not their Pre&s;byters, but the AGED among them, not only becau&s;e it immediately follows, "ye commanded the YOUNG men to think tho&s;e things that were mode&s;t and grave;" but be|cau&s;e the <HI>&ecirc;goumenoi,</HI> they had, in their FORMER orderly &s;tate, been &s;ubject to, were the PRESBYTERS of the church: for the&s;e, as has been proved, he el&s;e|where mentions as "&s;et over the church," and accordingly enjoins their "&s;ubjection to them;" nor are any higher church officers &s;poken of in his epi&s;tle; and what is more, he &s;peaks of the&s;e, as has been &s;aid, and will hereafter be further prov|ed, as actually ve&s;ted with EPISCOPACY.
<PB N="123" REF="012009_0132_0F8940A1AE8AB410">
The interpretation therefore is natural, obvious, and con&s;i&s;tent, which under|&s;tands the word <HI>pre&s;byteroi,</HI> in this place, not as pointing out the officers in the church, called Pre&s;byters, who had been &s;poken of in the immediately foregoing words; but as &s;ignifying, in its unappro|priated &s;en&s;e, AGED PERSONS: whereas, to con&s;true it otherwi&s;e, would make Clement a carele&s;s, inattentive, not to &s;ay blundering, incon&s;i&s;tent writer.</P>
<P>IN the other pa&s;&s;age, Clement, in op|po&s;ition to the PRESENT di&s;orderly, &s;edi|tious behavior of &s;ome in the Corinthian church, exhorts them to a temper and conduct better befiting their character as Chri&s;tians. Says he, "Let us rever|ence our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who&s;e blood was given for us; let us honor [<HI>tous pro|&ecirc;goumenous &ecirc;m&ocirc;n</HI>] tho&s;e who are &s;et over us; let us re&s;pect [<HI>tous Pre&s;byterous &ecirc;m&ocirc;n</HI>] the aged among us; let us in&s;truct the younger men [<HI>neous</HI>] in the fear of the Lord." The <HI>Pro&ecirc;goumenoi</HI> here are the &s;ame that are &s;poken of in the above pa&s;&s;age, that is, the Pre&s;byters who had been &s;et over the church. The word, <HI>pre&s;byteroi,</HI> therefore mu&s;t mean their
<PB N="124" REF="012009_0133_0F8940A26F852D28">
aged people. There will, in this con|&s;truction of the word, be order, propri|ety, and beauty, in the exhortations that are &s;everally made: whereas, if the word is tran&s;lated &s;o as to &s;ignify the Pre&s;by|ters of the church, there will be intro|duced tautology, and a breach of order in the advices that are here given.</P>
<P>THE interpretation I have exhibited of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages will more evidently ap|pear to be ju&s;t; if we turn to &s;ect. iiid, where Clement &s;pecifies the di&s;orders he would blame in the church at Corinth. His words are the&s;e, "They who were of no renown lifted them&s;elves up again&s;t the honorable; tho&s;e of no reputation again&s;t tho&s;e that were in re&s;pect; the fooli&s;h again&s;t the wi&s;e; the young men again&s;t the aged, <HI>neous epi tous Pre&s;|byterous:</HI> therefore righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace are departed from you."&mdash;The op|po&s;ition between the young men and the aged, is &s;o plain here, that none ever pretended to di&s;pute this &s;en&s;e of the word, <HI>pre&s;byteroi,</HI> in this place. And this, being its &s;en&s;e here, mu&s;t be its &s;en&s;e al|&s;o in the other pa&s;&s;ages we have con&s;ider|ed;
<PB N="125" REF="012009_0134_0F8940A32D767168">
for they all relate to one and the &s;ame thing.</P>
<P>I SHALL only &s;ubjoin upon this head; in Cotelerius's "apo&s;tolical fathers" by L'Clerc, in all the&s;e &s;ections, the word <HI>pre&s;buteroi</HI> is tran&s;lated AGED PERSONS. Arch-Bi&s;hop Wake al&s;o, in his "epi&s;tles of the fathers," renders, the &s;ame word, in all the above places, in the &s;ame manner: which I thus give notice of, becau&s;e their thus tran&s;lating the word, mu&s;t have proceeded from a full conviction of the nece&s;&s;ary propriety of this ver&s;ion, and not from want of a good heart to &s;erve the epi&s;copal cau&s;e, as far as they could with a good con&s;cience.</P>
<P>THE next plea, made in favor of the di&s;tinction between Bi&s;hops and Pre&s;by|ters, is fetched from &s;ect. xld, where Cle|ment &s;peaks of the threefold order in the Jewi&s;h church, "High-Prie&s;t, Prie&s;ts, and Levites:" which is &s;uppo&s;ed to be a plain intimation of a like threefold order in the Chri&s;tian church, in the di&s;tinct officers of Bi&s;hops, Pre&s;byters, and Dea|cons. And as this is an argument
<PB N="126" REF="012009_0135_0F8940A3EF6D1918">
great &s;tre&s;s is laid upon, I &s;hall be parti|cular in con&s;idering it.</P>
<P>ONLY I mu&s;t fir&s;t de&s;ire the reader care|fully to look over &s;ect. xxxvii, xl, xli, xlii, xliv, which I have &s;et down entire, that he may be able to judge of the manner in which the&s;e words are introduced, the purpo&s;e they are brought to &s;erve, and the &s;pecial application that is made of them; which mu&s;t certainly be allowed to be the be&s;t method to come at their genuine meaning. Nor can it be thought fair to fix upon a few words, in a connect|ed argumentative di&s;cour&s;e, and plead for them as they be di&s;-joined from what preceeds, and follows: but their &s;en&s;e mu&s;t be determined by the place they bear in the argument of which they are a part. Having ob&s;erved this,</P>
<P>I AM free to own, Clement, in order to reduce the church of Corinth to a &s;tate of regularity, pre&s;ents to their view the oeconomy of the Jewi&s;h church; in which proper order and decorum had been con&s;tituted, and was ob&s;erved. But when he mentions the "Jewi&s;h High-Prie&s;t, Prie&s;ts, and Levites," that it was his
<PB N="127" REF="012009_0136_0F8940A4AE1D7F08">
intention to exhibit a pattern of the Chri&s;tian church, under the threefold order of Bi&s;hops, Pre&s;byters, and Deacons, there is no appearance of a probability to &s;uppo&s;e: as will be evident if we con|&s;ider what follows in one conjunct view.</P>
<P N="1">I. LET us compare this with the like kind of arguing, in this epi&s;tle. In &s;ect. xxxvii, Clement &s;ets before the Co|rinthians the example of an army: in which every one has his proper place. "Some are only common Soldiers; &s;ome are Praefects; &s;ome Chiliarchs; &s;ome Centurions; &s;ome Chieftains of fifty; eve|ry one of whom keeps to his own &s;tation". Now, the de&s;ign of this compari&s;on is ob|vious, namely, to repre&s;ent the beauty and nece&s;&s;ity of the like regularity in the church of Corinth. And the mean|ing is intirely ab&s;olved in this general accommodation, without going &s;o far in|to the parallel, as to &s;uppo&s;e preci&s;ely as many di&s;tinct officers in the church, as there are in an army.</P>
<P>SURELY, it was not his meaning, "that the church militant mu&s;t be re|gimented into order, under Patriarchs.
<PB N="128" REF="012009_0137_0F8940A56D7D5320">
Arch-Bi&s;hops, Bi&s;hops, Prie&s;ts, and other officers, &s;uperior to the common chri&s;|tian military!" There is no imaginable rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, &s;uch a thought ever en|tered into his heart.</P>
<P>IN Sect. XLII, he, in like manner, propo&s;es to the con&s;ideration of the Corinthian church the good order that was ob&s;erved in the Jewi&s;h church, par|ticularly in their wor&s;hip. They had (as he repre&s;ents) "their &s;acrifices both propitiatory and euchari&s;tical:" but the&s;e were not to be offered "every where," but "at Jeru&s;alem only;" and not in every place even at Jeru&s;alem, but in "the temple on the altar." And his aim here is plain, to encourage, among the Co|rinthians, from this example, the like de|cent regularity; without carrying the mat|ter &s;o far, as to make the Jewi&s;h wor&s;hip an exact model for the Chri&s;tian. So in the ca&s;e before us: when Clement men|tions the "High-Prie&s;t, Prie&s;ts, and Le|vites," with each "their proper &s;ervices a&s;&s;igned them," though he &s;o far accom|modates this in&s;tance, as to argue it to be rea&s;onable, that there &s;hould be, in like manner, per&s;ons in the Chri&s;tian
<PB N="129" REF="012009_0138_0F8940A62CDAF0D0">
church, who&s;e proper bu&s;ine&s;s it might be to attend its mini&s;trations; yet, that there ought to be exactly a threefold or|der of them, in an&s;wer to the threefold order in the Jewi&s;h church, there is no more ground to think, than that the parallel in the foregoing ca&s;es, ought to be intirely completed. It is enough that the parallel an&s;wer in the general de&s;ign, he has in view, without making it, as we vulgarly &s;peak, "run on all four." And it de&s;erves particular notice, in the u&s;e Clement makes of this argu|ment, in the words immediately follow|ing, he regards only its general accom|modation. For thus he goes on, "Let every one of you, Brethren, in his own proper order give God thanks; living in good con&s;cience, and keeping within the defined rule of his &s;ervice." He infers nothing in particular from the example of the Jewi&s;h "High-Prie&s;t, Prie&s;ts, and Le|vites" with their "appointed &s;ervices;" but only, in general, takes occa&s;ion to re|commend it to every one, in his proper place, to keep the duties of his &s;tation; without &s;o much as giving the lea&s;t hint, as if there were ju&s;t three &s;tations in the church of Corinth, as there were in the
<PB N="130" REF="012009_0139_0F8940A7D75E6048">
church of the Jews; which mu&s;t needs be deemed an argument of great negli|gence, if he had intended any thing like an exact parallel. To go on,</P>
<P N="2">II. IT is mo&s;t obviou&s;ly remarkable, Clement purpo&s;ely &s;ets him&s;elf, in &s;ect. xliid, to exhibit an account of the apo&s;to|lic appointment of officers in the Chri&s;tian church: in which he quite lays a&s;ide the Jewi&s;h con&s;titution in a three|fold order, and mentions, in&s;tead of it, only the twofold order of Bi&s;hops and Deacons. Says he, "The Apo&s;tles have preached the go&s;pel to us from our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and Je&s;us Chri&s;t from God. For Chri&s;t was &s;ent by God, and the Apo&s;tles by Chri&s;t.&mdash;Preaching there|fore through cities and countries, they con&s;tituted their fir&s;t fruits for BISHOPS and DEACONS."</P>
<P>IT certainly would have been natural, if Clement had intended a parallel be|tween the Jewi&s;h "High-Prie&s;t, Prie&s;ts, and Levites," and Chri&s;tian "Bi&s;hops, Pre&s;byters, and Deacons;" I &s;ay, it would have been obvious for him to have ap|plied
<PB N="131" REF="012009_0140_0F8940A89638E378">
here his di&s;cour&s;e but a few lines above: e&s;pecially, con&s;idering he was &s;till upon the &s;ame argument, pur&s;uing one and the &s;ame de&s;ign. But is there the lea&s;t hint of any &s;uch application? So far from it, that he &s;ays not a &s;ylla|ble of a threefold, but expre&s;&s;ly mentions a twofold order; and this, as appointed by the Apo&s;tles: which is an incon&s;i&s;ten|cy, upon the impleaded interpretation, not capable of being removed by any art of man.</P>
<P>NOR is it unworthy of a remark, that, in proving this con&s;titution of Bi&s;hops and Deacons to be, not a novel thing, but what had long before been wrote about, Clement refers us to that pa&s;&s;age in I&s;aiah, "I will appoint their Bi&s;hops in righteou&s;ne&s;s, and Deacons in faith." Whether this text is pertinently quoted, or not, is not my bu&s;ine&s;s to inquire: but thus much is undeniable, that, had Cle|ment perceived any re&s;emblance between the Jewi&s;h "High-Prie&s;t and Levites," (of whom he had but ju&s;t before &s;poken) and chri&s;tian "Bi&s;hops and Deacons", he would have much &s;ooner have turned us back to that con&s;titution, then to this
<PB N="132" REF="012009_0141_0F8940A92D29B0F8">
text; and his omitting to do this, can be a&s;cribed to no other rational cau&s;e, but its not having entered his heart, to &s;uppo&s;e any exact parallel between the Jewi&s;h, and Chri&s;tian con&s;titution, in point of a threefold order of officers.</P>
<P N="3">III. IT may not be ami&s;s to inquire, upon &s;uppo&s;ition Clement really intend|ed the con&s;titution of the Jewi&s;h church, in "High-Prie&s;t, Prie&s;ts, and Levites," as a pattern for the con&s;titution of the chri&s;tian church; I &s;ay, it may not be improper to inquire; whether, even up|on this &s;uppo&s;ition, he &s;ays any thing in favor of a di&s;tinction of order be|tween Bi&s;hops and Pre&s;byters. And it is plain he does not. For Bi&s;hops, in the days of Clement, (according to the highe&s;t demand of prelatical writers) were the heads only of a few congrega|tions in particular cities, and their neigh|bouring villages: whereas, nothing is more known, than that the "High-Prie&s;t" &s;tood related, not to a few &s;yna|gogues in this, and the other city, and the towns bordering thereon; but to the whole Jewi&s;h church. There is therefore no analogy between Bi&s;hops,
<PB N="133" REF="012009_0142_0F8940A9ED9FC388">
and the Jewi&s;h High-Prie&s;t: nor &s;hall we be able to find one any where &s;hort of ROME. For, be&s;ides the POPE, there is no vi&s;ible head to the chri&s;tian church, in any proper &s;en&s;e, an&s;wering to the High-Prie&s;t among the Jews. One in|vi&s;ible one indeed there is, "Je&s;us the HIGH-PRIEST of our profe&s;&s;ion;" under whom are placed, in the church, Bi&s;hops or Pre&s;byters, and Deacons. And in this &s;en&s;e, the parallel is &s;trictly ju&s;t, and per|fectly con&s;onant to the whole tenor of Clement's epi&s;tle: in which Chri&s;t is ex|pre&s;&s;ly &s;poken of in the &s;tile of HIGH-PRIEST <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In &s;ect. xxxvi, we have the&s;e words, "This is the way, beloved, in which we may find our Savior, Je&s;us Chri&s;t, TON ARCHIEREA T&Ocirc;N PROSPHOR&Ocirc;N EM&Ocirc;N," that is, the "HIGH-PRIEST of our offerings."</NOTE>; and under him, no other offi|cers are mentioned, as con&s;tituted in the chri&s;tian church, but Bi&s;hops, who are al&s;o called Pre&s;byters, and Deacons. But if we mu&s;t have a vi&s;ible head to the church, corre&s;ponding to the High-Prie&s;t in the Jewi&s;h model, there is no avoiding a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the PAPAL CHAIR. And, accordingly, to this purpo&s;e the Romani&s;ts con&s;tantly make u&s;e of this pa&s;&s;age in Clement: and every one, with half an
<PB N="134" REF="012009_0143_0F8940AAB17D5F60">
eye, may &s;ee, that the parallel is far more ju&s;t and natural between the POPE and the High-Prie&s;t, than between the High-Prie&s;t and Bi&s;hops: &s;ince there may be hundreds of Bi&s;hops in the chri&s;tian church; whereas there neither was, nor could be, but one High-Prie&s;t in the Jewi&s;h.</P>
<P>IT will no doubt be here &s;aid, it was the manner, in ancient times, to argue from the con&s;titution of the Jewi&s;h church, in High-Prie&s;t, Prie&s;ts, and Le|vites, to the con&s;titution of the Chri&s;|tian church in Bi&s;hops, Pre&s;byters, and Deacons: and, therefore, that the pa|rallel ought here to be thus run, however unnatural it may appear. In an&s;wer whereto,</P>
<P>I READILY acknowledge, it was an ancient cu&s;tom to argue from the Jewi&s;h to the Chri&s;tian con&s;titution, as is plead|ed; but, at the &s;ame time, mu&s;t ob&s;erve, this method of arguing was not in u&s;e, in the days of Clement. It was plainly the invention of later times, when Epi&s;co|pacy (in &s;ome &s;ort analagous to the mo|dern &s;en&s;e of the word) began to &s;how it|&s;elf:

nor can an in&s;tance be produced, from any writer, until long after the days of Clement, wherein it is thus u&s;ed. It is not therefore fair to argue for this application of the words in Clement, from the like application of the &s;ame words, in tho&s;e authors, who had no being in the world, until Clement had been dead, and turned into du&s;t, for many years. Be&s;ides, it ought to be con&s;idered, the writers, in after times, directly &s;peak of Bi&s;hops in the &s;tile of High-Prie&s;ts, and expre&s;sly make them, in the parallel, an|&s;wer to the Jewi&s;h High-Prie&s;t; leaving no room for doubt in the matter, with how much weakne&s;s and aukwardne&s;s &s;o|ever they, upon this account, become chargeable. But is this the ca&s;e with Clement? Does he ever call a Bi&s;hop, High-Prie&s;t? Does he ever go about to apply the Jewi&s;h con&s;titution, &s;o as to make Bi&s;hops an&s;wer in the parallel to the High-Prie&s;t? So far from any thing of this tendency, that he makes mention (as we have &s;een) only of a twofold order of officers in the chri&s;tian church, and gives not the lea&s;t hint, as if he ever thought of a third that was higher.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="136" REF="012009_0145_0F8940AC2F51EFF8">IV. I SHALL add to what has been &s;aid, if Clement is interpreted in the &s;en&s;e I am oppo&s;ing, there will be no harmony between his di&s;cour&s;e here, and the cur|rent &s;train of his epi&s;tle; which, through the whole, perfectly agrees with the ac|count he gives of the twofold order of Bi&s;hops and Deacons; but not at all with a threefold one, in imitation of the Jewi&s;h hierarchy. It is common in this epi&s;tle, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, to meet with the word Bi&s;hops as well as Pre&s;by|ters; to which if Deacons are added, &s;ome may think, the parallel will be made out. But it is ob&s;ervable, there never once oc|curs, in Clement's epi&s;tle, &s;uch a mode of &s;peech, as Bi&s;hops, Pre&s;byters, and Deacons, the almo&s;t &s;acred and invaria|ble way of writing, after the di&s;tinction between Bi&s;hops and Pre&s;byters took place. And though (as was &s;aid) we read of Bi&s;hops, as well as Pre&s;byters, yet it is &s;o ordered, that the Bi&s;hops are ne|ver &s;o much as once di&s;tingui&s;hed from Pre&s;byters: nay, &s;o far is Clement from repre&s;enting any di&s;tinction of order be|tween them, that he directly con&s;iders the Pre&s;byters of Corinth, as ve&s;ted with the Epi&s;copal office, and in the mo&s;t plain

manner reflects blame upon that church, for "ca&s;ting their Pre&s;byters out of their Epi&s;copacy."&mdash;But of this we &s;hall more particularly &s;peak, under the la&s;t argu|ment, brought from Clement in defence of modern Epi&s;copacy.</P>
<P>AND this is taken from tho&s;e words in &s;ect. xliv, "And the Apo&s;tles knew by our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that there would be contention about the name of Epi&s;|copacy: therefore, being endued with perfect foreknowledge, they con&s;tituted the before-mentioned per&s;ons (namely, Bi&s;hops and Deacons;) and moreover gave direction how, if they &s;hould die, other approved men &s;hould &s;ucceed in their mini&s;try."&mdash;Here it is urged, the Apo&s;tles are repre&s;ented as knowing there would ari&s;e tho&s;e, who would appear again&s;t the cau&s;e of Epi&s;copacy; and, as it were on purpo&s;e, to guard again&s;t it, did them&s;elves appoint Bi&s;hops in the church, and provide for a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of others in this office, after the decea&s;e of tho&s;e they appointed.</P>
<P>THIS plea, however often it has been urged, I &s;hall &s;how to be altogether inva|lid,
<PB N="138" REF="012009_0147_0F8940ADAE292768">
by making it evident, even from Cle|ment him&s;elf, that his di&s;cour&s;e in this pa&s;&s;age is &s;o far from favoring any di&s;|tinction of order between Bi&s;hops and Pre&s;byters, that it is the &s;tronge&s;t te&s;ti|mony, in his whole epi&s;tle, for their be|ing the &s;ame order of officers in the church; and &s;uch an one, that we could not have de&s;ired a &s;tronger, if we had been pre&s;ent, when this was exhibited, to direct his pen.</P>
<P>THE te&s;timony begins," And the Apo&s;tles knew by our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, there would be contention about the name of Epi&s;copacy."&mdash;But what are we to under&s;tand by this "Epi&s;copacy?" Is it &s;uch an one, as they only are ve&s;ted with, who are officers in the church &s;uperior in their order to Pre&s;byters? The modern u&s;e, and &s;ound, of the word, may po&s;&s;ibly be apt to lead the le&s;s thinking reader into &s;uch an imagination: but the term Epi&s;copacy, in the days of Clement, had quite another meaning from what it has now. With him, it intends only an over&s;ight of the flock; &s;uch an Epi&s;co|pacy, as per&s;ons nothing more than Pre&s;|byters might be, and actually were,
<PB N="139" REF="012009_0148_0F8940AE6EDE36F8">
ve&s;ted with. And for the proof of this, I &s;hall appeal to Clement him&s;elf; who, in this very &s;ection, tells us as much in the mo&s;t plain language. His words are the&s;e, "For it is no &s;mall &s;in, if we ca&s;t tho&s;e out of their Epi&s;copacy, [<HI>Epi&s;|kop&ecirc;s,</HI> the very word u&s;ed above] who have offered their gifts in an holy manner: Ble&s;&s;ed are tho&s;e PRESBYTERS who have fir&s;t fini&s;hed their cour&s;e." It &s;eems then Pre&s;byters might, in Clement's opini|on, be ve&s;ted with Epi&s;copacy, becau&s;e he declares the Pre&s;byters of Corinth were in fact thus ve&s;ted. Nor was the con|tention, "the Apo&s;tles knew there would be about the name of Epi&s;copacy," any other than &s;uch a contention as then ac|tually &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in the church of Corinth. And what was this? Not a contention, whether there was a di&s;tinction of order between Bi&s;hops and Pre&s;byters: we have no hint of any &s;uch thing any where in the epi&s;tle; but it was a contention a|bout the mini&s;terial order it&s;elf; a con|tention about the office of Pre&s;byters, or (as they are likewi&s;e called) Bi&s;hops; which the people had carried to &s;uch an height, as that they had ro&s;e up again&s;t their Bi|&s;hops or Pre&s;byters, and turned them out of their Epi&s;copacy.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="012009_0149_0F8940AF2E1F6368">THE plea goes on, the Apo&s;tles, to guard again&s;t this contention about Epi&s;copa|cy, "con&s;tituted Bi&s;hops and Deacons, and moreover gave direction (according to others a roll or li&s;t) that, when they &s;hould die, other approved men might &s;ucceed in the mini&s;try." And no one doubts, but the Apo&s;tles appointed Bi|&s;hops, and provided for a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;uch officers in the church. But the que&s;tion is, Who are here meant by the&s;e Bi&s;hops? Were they an order in the church di&s;tinct from, and &s;uperior to, Pre&s;byters? Clement him&s;elf can be&s;t inform us.

Let us then examine the connection of his di&s;cour&s;e in this paragraph.</P>
<P>AND he very plainly lays it down (1) That "the Apo&s;tles knew there would be contention about Epi&s;copacy." (2) To guard again&s;t this, they did them|&s;elves "appoint Bi&s;hops and Deacons in the church"; that is, (if we turn to &s;ect. xlii, the place he him&s;elf has refer|ed
<PB N="141" REF="012009_0150_0F8940AFF008BCD8">
to) they con&s;tituted of the "fir&s;t fruits of their conver&s;ions, a number of Bi&s;hops and Deacons" for the benefit of the church, as believers &s;hould after|wards increa&s;e. (3) Be&s;ides this con&s;ti|tution of per&s;ons, they "gave direction," as deaths &s;hould happen, that "others &s;hould be con&s;tituted to &s;ucceed in their room." (4) From the&s;e premi&s;es, he in|fers it to be an unju&s;tifiable thing to "ca&s;t tho&s;e out of their Epi&s;copacy," who have behaved well; whether they had been con&s;tituted by the Apo&s;tles them&s;elves, or other excellent men af|terwards. And now (5) To bring his argument to a point, and to let the church of Corinth certainly know, that he aimed at them in all this di&s;cour&s;e; and de&s;igned to condemn their un&s;utable conduct towards their Pre&s;byters, he offers to their con&s;ideration the "ble&s;&s;ed|ne&s;s of tho&s;e Pre&s;byters, who have gone off the &s;tage," in this article in &s;peci|al, "that they could not be removed out of the place where they were fixed, as they had removed &s;ome of their Pre&s;|byters from their honorable mini&s;tra|tions."</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="012009_0151_0F8940B0B4A60AE8">THIS is the unque&s;tionable connection of Clement's arguing in this paragraph. Upon which I would appeal to any per&s;on of common under&s;tanding, whether he could have any other intention, in this train of rea&s;oning, than to offer conviction to the church of Corinth, of their faulty con|duct in "ca&s;ting their Pre&s;byters out of their office?" But if their Pre&s;byters had been any other than tho&s;e Bi&s;hops, he had &s;poken of as con&s;tituted, either by the Apo&s;tles them&s;elves, or other famous men afterwards, what pertinency is there in this method of rea&s;oning? He men|tions only Bi&s;hops and Deacons as con|&s;tituted by the Apo&s;tles, or to be con|&s;tituted afterwards by others, by their direction. If therefore the Pre&s;byters of Corinth had not been in the number of tho&s;e Bi&s;hops, they had not acted again&s;t any apo&s;tolical con&s;titution, and could not fall by the force of this arguing: whereas, on the other hand, if by the&s;e Pre&s;byters we under&s;tand the &s;ame order of officers with the Bi&s;hops here &s;poken of, and con&s;ider the words Bi&s;hops and Pre&s;byters, as only different names to point out the &s;ame per&s;ons, the rea&s;oning will not only be clear and forceable, but

perfectly con&s;onant to the connection of his whole di&s;cour&s;e; which &s;o obviou&s;ly and nece&s;&s;arily leads to this, that I am well &s;atisfied no art of man can elude the evidence there is for it.</P>
<P>BESIDES, if the&s;e Bi&s;hops were an or|der of officers &s;uperior to Pre&s;byters, why &s;hould Clement &s;o particularly mention the apo&s;tolic con&s;titution of Bi&s;hops, about whom (as officers di&s;tinct from, and &s;uperior to, Pre&s;byters) there is no hint, in the epi&s;tle, as if there was any conten|tion; and, at the &s;ame time, omit &s;aying a word about the con&s;titution of Pre&s;by|ters, (as he certainly does, if they are an order di&s;tinct from Bi&s;hops) again&s;t whom the church of Corinth had ro&s;e up in the mo&s;t un&s;eemly manner? This &s;eems al|together unintelligible: e&s;pecially con|&s;idering, it is the governing de&s;ign of this whole epi&s;tle, and of this paragraph in &s;pecial, to correct the conduct of the Co|rinthians towards their PRESBYTERS, and &s;et them right in their behavior for time to come.</P>
<P>AND now, being let into the true meaning of Clement's Bi&s;hops, the con|trover&s;y,

among the learned, about that difficult word <HI>epinomin,</HI> in that part of the paragraph, where mention is made of the apo&s;tolic provi&s;ion for the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Bi&s;hops, is quite &s;uper&s;eded.

<P>ONLY I cannot omit ob&s;erving, that the con&s;truction, which &s;uppo&s;es the Apo&s;tles to have given a li&s;t, or roll of &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, does not &s;eem at all probable. For, as the learned Boy&s;e argues again&s;t this interpretation,
<Q>Who ever heard of &s;uch a li&s;t or roll? Was it a catalogue of all their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors to the worlds end? Or a li&s;t of their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, for one, two, or three centuries? How came this li&s;t, or roll to be lo&s;t? when the pre&s;ervation of it would have been of &s;uch va&s;t con&s;equence, to prevent all di&s;putes about future elections. For
<PB N="145" REF="012009_0154_0F8940B3D5A64068">
doubtle&s;s the churches would readily have concurred in the choice of &s;uch, as the Apo&s;tles, from certain foreknow|ledge, had marked down for Bi&s;hops and Deacons. So that it is certain, either this catalogue was never given by them, or tho&s;e churches, to whom it was given, were guilty of inexcu&s;a|ble negligence, in &s;uffering &s;o valua|ble a roll, that would have cleared up the uninterrupted line of Epi&s;copal &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, beyond di&s;pute, to be &s;o ut|terly lo&s;t, that no notion, no monu|ment of it, &s;hould be heard of to this day, and no Bi&s;hop ever once appeal to it, to ju&s;tifie his claim again&s;t com|petitors.</Q></P>
<P>THE evidence &s;upppo&s;ed to be con|tained in this epi&s;tle, for the &s;uperiority of Bi&s;hops to Pre&s;byters, being thus re|moved out of the way; I am under the fairer advantage to propo&s;e a few ob&s;er|vations, which &s;eem abundantly &s;uffici|ent to &s;how it to have been the mind of Clement, that Bi&s;hops and Pre&s;byters were, in his day, one and the &s;ame or|der of officers in the Chri&s;tian church. And,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="146" REF="012009_0155_0F8940B48B77AF28">1. I OBSERVE, when Clement &s;ets him|&s;elf, ex profe&s;&s;o, to give an account of the apo&s;tolical con&s;titution of officers in the Chri&s;tian church; and this, not in one or two particular places only, but throughout cities and countries, as they travelled to propagate the faith of Chri&s;t; he makes mention only of the two or|ders of Bi&s;hops and Deacons. And it is remarkable, how exactly con&s;onant this account is, to the &s;cripture account of the con&s;titution of the church of Philippi; in writing to whom, the Apo&s;tle Paul takes notice of no other officers among them, &s;ave only Bi&s;hops and Deacons. And the &s;ame Apo&s;tle writing to Timo|thy about church officers, de&s;cribes only the qualifications of Bi&s;hops and Dea|cons.</P>
<P N="2">2. I OBSERVE what is yet more full to my purpo&s;e, tho&s;e Bi&s;hops, Clement men|tions as con&s;tituted by the Apo&s;tles, or other famous men afterwards, were one and the &s;ame order of men with Pre&s;by|ters: otherwi&s;e, he pa&s;&s;es over a whole order of eccle&s;ia&s;tical officers; and this, at a time when he had undertaken to ex|hibit an account of the apo&s;tolic con&s;ti|tution
<PB N="147" REF="012009_0156_0F8940B52D7851E0">
of officers, in the Chri&s;tian church; which cannot but be thought an inex|cu&s;able omi&s;&s;ion. The only officers he takes notice of, as appointed by the Apo&s;|tles, are Bi&s;hops and Deacons. But if by the term Bi&s;hops, he does not mean the &s;ame kind of officers with tho&s;e that are called Pre&s;byters, he has certainly not &s;aid a word about any appointment of this order of officers; which is unac|countably &s;trange, con&s;idering he makes particular mention of the lower order in the church, that of Deacons. And in|deed, unle&s;s we &s;uppo&s;e Clement to mean preci&s;ely the &s;ame &s;ort of officers, when he u&s;es, &s;ometimes the word Bi&s;hops, and &s;ometimes the word Pre&s;byters, we &s;hall make him a mo&s;t blundering writer. For one of the main arguments he u&s;es, to reflect blame upon the church of Co|rinth, for ri&s;ing up again&s;t their Pre&s;|byters, is, the apo&s;tolic con&s;titution of Bi&s;hops: but if by this term, he did not mean the &s;ame &s;ort of officers, where would be the force of this rea&s;oning? How would it tend to afford conviction to the Corinthians, that they had done ill in acting again&s;t their Pre&s;byters, to be told of the apo&s;tolic appointment of one
<PB N="148" REF="012009_0157_0F8940B5ED60ED98">
order of officers &s;uperior to their Pre&s;by|ters, and another inferior to them; while, at the &s;ame time, not a word is &s;aid whe|ther the order of Pre&s;byters was ever con|&s;tituted at all? Such a method of rea|&s;oning is certainly very extraordinary, and much better calculated to encourage them in their &s;edition, than to bring them to repentance, and put a &s;top to it. Bi|&s;hops therefore with Clement are the &s;ame rank of officers with Pre&s;byters. And, as if he had it in de&s;ign, that we &s;hould not mi&s;take him, he plainly &s;peaks of the Pre&s;byters of Corinth, as &s;ome of tho&s;e very Bi&s;hops that were con&s;tituted either by the Apo&s;tles, or others after|wards by their direction: for he &s;uppo&s;es them placed in the epi&s;copal office, in that he directly finds fault with the Corinthi|ans "for ca&s;ting them out of their Epi&s;|copacy."</P>
<P>AND upon this, it is mo&s;t obvious to take notice of the perfect harmony there is, between the language of Clement and the Apo&s;tle Paul; who, when he had left Titus in Crete to ordain Elders in every city, writes to him to acquaint him with the qualifications that ought to
<PB N="149" REF="012009_0158_0F8940B6ADD84460">
be found in tho&s;e, who were to be con&s;ti|tuted Bi&s;hops; evidently u&s;ing the words, Pre&s;byters and Bi&s;hops, as &s;ignifying the &s;ame order of church officers. The Evan|geli&s;t Luke likewi&s;e &s;peaks of the Apo&s;|tles, as ordaining Elders in every church; which is mo&s;t plainly the &s;ame account with this of Clement, who mentions them as con&s;tituting Bi&s;hops in the churches they founded: for the&s;e Bi&s;hops were no other than Elders; and if Clement had &s;poken of the Apo&s;tles, as appointing Elders or Pre&s;byters in the churches they planted, it would have been perfectly the &s;ame thing with his &s;aying, that they ap|pointed Bi&s;hops.</P>
<P N="3">3. I OBSERVE, as a yet further confir|mation of what we are upon, that Pre&s;|byter-Bi&s;hops are the highe&s;t order of ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical officers &s;poken of in this epi&s;tle. They are the only per&s;ons mentioned as "&s;et over the church of Corinth;" they are the only per&s;ons that church are ex|horted to be "in &s;ubjection to:" nor is there a word li&s;ped of any duty owing from them to any &s;uperior order of men; no, nor the lea&s;t hint given of any &s;uch order; which leads me to ob&s;erve in the la&s;t place,</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="150" REF="012009_0159_0F8940B76F1901C0">4. THE moral a&s;&s;urance we have, that Clement knew of no Bi&s;hop, at lea&s;t, in the church of Corinth, of a &s;uperior or|der to that of Pre&s;byter.&mdash;Let us con&s;ider the direction of the epi&s;tle: it runs in that &s;tile, "the church of Rome to the church of Corinth," without any notice at all of their Bi&s;hop; which is &s;o much unlike the manner of in&s;criptions in after times, when Bi&s;hops were di&s;tingui&s;hed from Pre&s;byters, that, from this circum|&s;tance only, it looks probable, there was no &s;ingle Bi&s;hop at the head of that church. But the probability will be heightened in|to certainty, if we add, there is as intire &s;ilence, through the whole epi&s;tle, of the Bi&s;hop of this church: whereas, if any &s;ingle per&s;on had been at their head of an order di&s;tinct from their Pre&s;byters, and inve&s;ted with a &s;uperior right of au|thoritatively managing in all eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal affairs, it is not conceivable but he mu&s;t, &s;ome how or other, have been plainly pointed out.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t, mo&s;t &s;uperior, and di&s;tin|gui&s;hed officer in this church, could not but have been intere&s;ted in the &s;hameful di&s;turbance that was the occa&s;ion of this
<PB N="151" REF="012009_0160_0F8940B82EA11A70">
letter. He mu&s;t have joined, either with the Pre&s;byters, or the people, or have been an idle &s;pectator of the pre&s;ent quar|rel; and, in either ca&s;e, there are great difficulties to be accounted for.</P>
<P>IF he had been united with the Pre&s;|byters, and made u&s;e of his Epi&s;copal au|thority to oblige the people to peace, and their duty to their Pre&s;byters, it is &s;trange they are no where reprimanded for di&s;re|garding the authority of their Bi&s;hop! nor can it well be imagined, that Clement &s;hould be &s;o &s;evere upon them for their in|decent carriage to their Pre&s;byters, and yet &s;ilently pa&s;s over their di&s;obedience to their Bi&s;hop; which mu&s;t &s;urely have de&s;erved a rebuke, if they had oppo&s;ed his autho|rity, in their u&s;age of their Pre&s;byters.</P>
<P>OR, if he had favoured the Corinthian church, in their ill treatment of their Pre&s;byters, it is much lie is not rea&s;oned with, that he might be convinced of his mi&s;take: &s;ince the church are &s;o &s;harply rebuked, and earne&s;tly exhorted to re|pentance and amendment: nor is it ea&s;y to conceive of the propriety (according to the epi&s;copal &s;cheme) of their being
<PB N="152" REF="012009_0161_0F8940B8EF652DC0">
thus blamed, and condemned, while they had the countenance of their Bi&s;hop in what they did. Upon this &s;uppo&s;ition, the fir&s;t thing nece&s;&s;ary, in order to peace, mu&s;t have been to have offered conviction to the Bi&s;hop, and engaged him to de&s;i&s;t from encouraging the church, in their &s;e|ditious practice again&s;t their Pre&s;byters.</P>

<HEAD>POLYCARP.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">His character, writings, and te&s;timonies from them, with ob&s;ervations and remarks.</HEAD>
<P>PREVIOUS to what may be offered re|lative to this Father, I would give notice, that the order of time is a little broke in upon, by giving him a place here; for his "epi&s;tle to the Philippians" was not wrote until after the death of Ignatius, who mu&s;t therefore have wrote before him. But, as there are &s;ome im|portant pa&s;&s;ages, in his "epi&s;tle," the reader &s;hould be acquainted with, before he comes to Ignatius, it was thought be&s;t to place him fir&s;t. Having ob&s;erved this, I go on;</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="012009_0165_0F8940BCD708BA80">POLYCARP had his birth in the apo&s;tolic age; and probably not a great many years on this &s;ide, the middle of the fir&s;t cen|tury. Some modern authors &s;peak of him as born in Smyrna; as being a &s;lave in his younger years, and bought by a certain Lady named Cale&s;to, who, toge|ther with giving him his freedom, in|&s;tructed him in the Chri&s;tian religion, and afterwards made him her heir. But as the&s;e accounts, with many other of a like import, are extracted from writers great|ly remote from the age in which Poly|carp lived, and that were too much given to the romantic &s;train, they are not to be depended on.</P>
<P>IT may, upon much better authority, be e&s;teemed a ju&s;t &s;troke in his character, that he was one that "&s;at under the teaching of the Apo&s;tles," and was fa|miliarly "conver&s;ant with tho&s;e that knew our Lord," and particularly "with the Apo&s;tle John." This ac|count we have from Irenaeus, which we may the rather give credit to, becau&s;e he &s;peaks not only of his having, "in his younger years, &s;een Polycarp;" but as
<PB N="157" REF="012009_0166_0F8940BD6D66C998">
"retaining in his mind a di&s;tinct remem|brance of having heard him relate the&s;e things."</P>
<P>HE likewi&s;e makes mention of him as Bi&s;hop of Smyrna, and as placed in this office by the Apo&s;tles; though Tertullian names none of the Apo&s;tles, &s;ave "John," as having an hand in his con&s;titution. And Eu&s;ebius only &s;ays in general, "He was made Bi&s;hop by tho&s;e, who &s;aw the Lord, and mini&s;tred to him." But how|ever it might be as to this circum&s;tance, there is no difficulty about the thing it|&s;elf. He is readily allowed to have been Bi&s;hop of Smyrna.</P>
<P>AND from hence a mighty argument is drawn, in favor of his having been of an order in the church, &s;uperior to that of Pre&s;byters; e&s;pecially, when, in conjunc|tion herewith, that is &s;uppo&s;ed to be true, which Arch-Bi&s;hop U&s;her has endea|vored to prove to be &s;o, namely, That he was Bi&s;hop of Smyrna, when the Apo&s;tle John &s;ent his "apocalyptical letter" to the "Angel of that church." But the foundation of the argument at once vani&s;hes, when it is con&s;idered, that,
<PB N="158" REF="012009_0167_0F8940BE2E89C5C8">
in the age of Polycarp, no &s;uch thing as a di&s;tinction of order, between Bi|&s;hops and Pre&s;byters, was known in the church. This we have already proved from Clement of Rome, and Hermas, both Polycarp's contemporaries; and &s;hall further confirm from Polycarp him|&s;elf, when we come to take notice of his "epi&s;tle to the Philippians." And what is particularly ob&s;ervable, in the ca&s;e of Polycarp, he is by Irenaeus called Pre&s;|byter, as well as Bi&s;hop. In his epi&s;tle to Florinus, that is the &s;tile in which he &s;peaks of him, "Polycarp, [<HI>apo&s;tolikos Pre&s;|buteros</HI>] the apo&s;tolical Pre&s;byter"; which is the more worthy of notice, becau&s;e, with Irenaeus, the reciprocal u&s;e of the words, Bi&s;hop and Pre&s;byter, is very common. And herein (as we &s;hall &s;ee in the progre&s;s of this work) there is a won|derful agreement among the writers of this age, Ignatius only excepted, which we &s;hall account for afterwards. So that if we &s;hould, even, &s;uppo&s;e, the "An|gel of the church of Smyrna" to be Po|lycarp, a then Bi&s;hop of that church, &s;o long as we are ju&s;t to interpret the word Bi&s;hop, in the &s;en&s;e, in which it was un|der&s;tood, in this age of Chri&s;tianity, no|thing
<PB N="159" REF="012009_0168_0F8940BEEE11D2C0">
more can be made of it, than that he was an officer in that church, of the &s;ame order with the re&s;t of the Pre&s;by|ters of it: though he might be the mo&s;t eminent, known, and di&s;tingui&s;hed among them; and the mo&s;t proper, upon the&s;e accounts, to receive a letter which con|cerned the whole church.</P>
<P>IT is commonly, in modern accounts of the life of Polycarp, mentioned as an article particularly redounding to his ho|nor, that the venerable Ignatius had &s;uch an opinion of him, as a truly apo&s;tolical man, that he pitched upon him, as the mo&s;t &s;uitable per&s;on he could commend the care of his church at Antioch to, when he was parted from them, and on his journey to Rome, to &s;uffer mar|tyrdom. He is likewi&s;e highly e&s;teem|ed in love, and reverenced, as being the &s;uppo&s;ed collector of the epi&s;tles of Ig|natius: which, together with one of his own, he is &s;aid to have &s;ent, by one Cre&s;cens, to the church of Philippi.&mdash;But the&s;e things we &s;hall have occa&s;ion to ex|amine, at large, in a more proper place; and &s;o &s;hall leave them at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="012009_0169_0F8940BFAE586910">NOTHING more is found recorded of this primitive Father, until the ea&s;tern and we&s;|tern churches began to controvert about the time of keeping ea&s;ter; which occa&s;ion|ed his going to Rome (about the middle of the &s;econd century) in the days of Ani|cetus, to confer with him upon that mat|ter. And notwith&s;tanding all the di&s;|cour&s;e, the&s;e grave Fathers might have up|on this head, they could not come to an agreement; the one pleading apo&s;tolical practice for one time of ob&s;erving this fea&s;t, and the other the cu&s;tom of his predece&s;&s;ors, even up to the Apo&s;tles, for another: yet they were charitably di&s;|po&s;ed towards each other; which they &s;ignified, by communicating together: and Anicetus, for the reverence he had for Polycarp, gave him the euchari&s;t in his church; after which they ami|cably parted; and, as Eu&s;ebius &s;ays, "in the univer&s;al church, they were at peace with one another."</P>
<P>HOWEVER this might be, I cannot help going out of my way to ob&s;erve, that peace did not continue very long; for the con|trover&s;y, far from having a final &s;top now put to it, &s;trangely increa&s;ed afterwards,
<PB N="161" REF="012009_0170_0F8940C06DAD7370">
until it had even over&s;pread the whole Chri&s;tian world, and filled it with un|charitablene&s;s and contention. It &s;eems to have been at a mon&s;trous height, to|wards the latter end of the &s;econd centu|ry, in the days of Victor, who (to rely on the authority of Sir Peter King) was &s;o very turbulent and imperious, that he excommunicated the A&s;iatics, for their not complying with the church of Rome in this matter; condemning them for Heretics, and be&s;towing upon them a long and frightful name, becau&s;e they kept their ea&s;ter upon the fourteenth day after the appearance of the moon, or at full moon, on what day &s;oever it hap|pened. Nor was this controver&s;y &s;ettled, until the council of Nice, anno 325, by their authority, decided it; decreeing, that, throughout the whole Chri&s;tian world, ea&s;ter &s;hould be ob&s;erved, not on the day that the Jewi&s;h pa&s;&s;over fell, that is, at full moon; but on the Lord's day en&s;uing, as it was afterwards kept.</P>
<P>THE learned Stillingfleet improves this controver&s;y, by deducing from it an ar|gument again&s;t the certainty of preten|ded apo&s;tolic tradition, in a manner well
<PB N="162" REF="012009_0171_0F8940C12DC4D3D0">
worth our in&s;erting.
<Q>For my part (&s;ays he) I &s;ee not how any man, that would &s;ee rea&s;on for what he does, can adhere to the church for an unque&s;tio|nable tradition, received from the Apo&s;|tles; when, in the ca&s;e of keeping ea&s;|ter, whether with the Jews on the fourteenth moon, or only on the Lord's day, there was &s;o much unrea&s;onable heat &s;hewed on both &s;ides, and &s;uch confidence that, on either &s;ide, their tradition was apo&s;tolical. They had herein all the advantages imaginable, in order to the knowing the certain|ty of the thing then in que&s;tion among them; as their nearne&s;s to apo&s;tolical times, being but one remove from them; yea, the per&s;ons contending, pleading per&s;onal acquaintance with &s;ome of the Apo&s;tles them&s;elves, as Polycarp with John, and Anicetus of Rome that he had the tradition from Peter: and yet, &s;o great were the heats, &s;o irrecon|cileable the controver&s;y, that they pro|ceeded to dart the thunderbolt of ex|communication in one anothers faces.</Q></P>
<P>I WILL here add, what makes this con|trover&s;y the more &s;trange, is, that there
<PB N="163" REF="012009_0172_0F8940C1EEEF55C8">
is no account in &s;cripture of the in&s;titu|tion of any &s;uch annual fea&s;t; nor the lea&s;t intimation, that it was ever ob|&s;erved by Chri&s;tians in the Apo&s;tle's days. Upon which, I cannot re&s;train my&s;elf from tran&s;cribing the thoughts of Socrates, one of our mo&s;t ancient and valuable eccle|&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;torians, upon this head. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. V. Cap. 22.</NOTE> Says he,
<Q>Neither the ancients, nor the mo|derns, who have &s;tudiou&s;ly followed the Jews, had, in my judgment, any ju&s;t or rational cau&s;e of contending &s;o much about this fe&s;tival. For they con&s;idered not with them&s;elves, that, when the Jewi&s;h religion was changed into Chri&s;tianity, tho&s;e accurate ob&s;er|vances of the mo&s;aic law, and the types of things future, cea&s;ed. And this car|ries along with it, its own demon&s;tra|tion. For no one of Chri&s;t's laws has permitted the Chri&s;tians to ob&s;erve the rites of the Jews. Moreover, on the contrary, the Apo&s;tle has expre&s;&s;ly for|bid this, and does not only reject cir|cumci&s;ion, but always advi&s;es again&s;t contending about fe&s;tival days. Where|fore, in his epi&s;tle to the Galatians, his
<PB N="164" REF="012009_0173_0F8940C2ADEDEF40">
words are the&s;e, "Tell me, ye that de|&s;ire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?" And having &s;pent &s;ome few words in his di&s;cour&s;e here|of, he demon&s;trates, that the people of the Jews are "&s;ervants," but that tho&s;e who followed Chri&s;t are "called to liberty." Moreover, it is his admo|nition, "that days, and months, and years, &s;hould in no wi&s;e be ob&s;erved". Be&s;ides, in his epi&s;tle to the Colo&s;&s;ians, he loudly affirms, that &s;uch ob&s;ervations "are a &s;hadow." Wherefore he &s;ays, Let no man judge you in meat, or in drink, or in re&s;pect of any holy-day, or of the new moons, or of the &s;ab|bath days; which are a &s;hadow of things to come.</Q>
<Q>&mdash;The Apo&s;tles there|fore, and the go&s;pels, have no where impo&s;ed the yoke of &s;ervitude on tho&s;e, who have approached the preaching of faith; but have left the fea&s;t of ea&s;ter, and the other fe&s;tivals, to be honored by their gratitude and benevolence, who have had benefits conferred on them on the&s;e days. Wherefore, in regard men love fe&s;tivals, becau&s;e thereon they have ce&s;&s;ation from their labours, each per&s;on, in every place, according to his
<PB N="165" REF="012009_0174_0F8940C3702B67D8">
own plea&s;ure, has, by a certain cu&s;tom, celebrated the memory of the &s;aving pa&s;&s;ion. For neither our Savior, nor his Apo&s;tles, have enjoined us by any law to ob&s;erve this fe&s;tival. Nor have the go&s;pels, or the Apo&s;tles, threaten|ed us with any mulct, puni&s;hment, or cur&s;e, as the mo&s;aic law does the Jews. Moreover, it was not the Apo&s;tle's de&s;ign to make laws concerning fe&s;ti|val days, but to introduce good life and piety. And it &s;eems to me, that, as many other things, in &s;everal places, have been e&s;tabli&s;hed by cu&s;tom, &s;o the fea&s;t of ea&s;ter al&s;o had a peculiar ob|&s;ervation among all per&s;ons, from &s;ome old u&s;age, in regard none of the Apo&s;tles (as I have &s;aid) have made any determinate decree about it. Now, that the ob&s;ervation of this fe&s;tival had its original, among all men, in the primitive times, from cu&s;tom ra|ther than law, the things them&s;elves do demon&s;trate.</Q>
And this he goes on in &s;everal pages clearly to make out. But I mu&s;t now return,</P>
<P>POLYCARP, being at Rome, did not for|get his character as a mini&s;ter of Je&s;us
<PB N="166" REF="012009_0175_0F8940C42D4EF7F0">
Chri&s;t; but &s;et him&s;elf to defend the doc|trines of the go&s;pel: which he did to good purpo&s;e, confirming the &s;ouls of many, and recovering &s;ome from the poi&s;onous errors of tho&s;e two arch-heretics Marci|on and Valentinus. The former of the&s;e he once accidentally met in the &s;treets of Rome, but had no other conver&s;ation with him, than to let him know, that he e&s;teem|ed him to be the "fir&s;t-born of &s;atan." This may po&s;&s;ibly be thought a rough compliment; but it is a &s;trong argu|ment of his great indignation again&s;t tho&s;e, who had &s;o abominably corrupted the faith of Chri&s;t. Irenaeus attributes this &s;everity of language to his &s;trict ad|herence to that apo&s;tolic rule, "A man that is an heretic, after the fir&s;t and &s;e|cond admonition, reject: knowing that he that is &s;uch is perverted, and &s;inneth, being condemned of him&s;elf."</P>
<P>THE next thing we meet with, concern|ing Polycarp, relates to his death; which he did not &s;uffer until he had long la|bored in the &s;ervice of Chri&s;t. He is univer&s;ally acknowledged to have lived to be very old, not under ninety; and &s;ome think, con&s;iderably upwards of an
<PB N="167" REF="012009_0176_0F8940C4ECB36F88">
hundred years: and yet, he did not go out of the world in the ordinary way, but fell a martyr in the cau&s;e of Chri&s;t. We have extant an "epi&s;tle of the church of Smyrna", giving a particular account of his martyrdom, as to its time, occa&s;ion, manner, and circum&s;tances. Dr. Cave calls it a piece "that challenges a &s;ingu|lar e&s;teem and reverence, both for its &s;ub|ject matter, and antiquity; with the rea|ding of which, he joins with Scaliger in &s;aying, every &s;erious and devout mind mu&s;t needs be &s;o affected, as to think he can never have enough of it." And it is very true, &s;ome parts of this epi&s;tle are well calculated to affect a &s;erious and well-di&s;po&s;ed mind; but then, it has &s;uch a mixture of what &s;o evidently carries the face of meer fable, as to make it que&s;ti|onable, whether it be an exact repre|&s;entation of what was real fact. An in|&s;tance of this we have in Sect. xv, where we read of "the flames di&s;po&s;ing them|&s;elves into the re&s;emblance of an arch, like the &s;ails of a &s;hip &s;welled with the wind, gently encircling the body of the martyr; who &s;tood all the while in the mid&s;t, not like roa&s;ted fle&s;h, but gold pu|rified in the furnace; his body &s;ending
<PB N="168" REF="012009_0177_0F8940C699A0D250">
forth a delightful fragrancy, like frank|incen&s;e or co&s;tly &s;pices, pre&s;enting it|&s;elf to the &s;en&s;es of the by-&s;tanders." Of the &s;ame nature is &s;ect. xvi, which &s;peaks of "his body as incapable of being con|&s;umed by the fire; upon which the ex|ecutioner, being commanded, thru&s;t a launce into him: which he had no &s;ooner done, but a pigeon came forth out of the wound; and, together therewith, &s;uch a large quantity of blood as extingui&s;hed the fire." Some other things, in the like &s;train, are here to be met with; which, perhaps, not many will find a faith wide enough to &s;wallow.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t not indeed be concealed, Eu|&s;ebius has thought it worth while, not only to mention this "epi&s;tle," but to give the greate&s;t part of it a place in his "eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory." But then, it ought to be ob&s;erved, he is the fir&s;t wri|ter that takes any notice of it. And if his mentioning it be u&s;ed as an argu|ment to e&s;tabli&s;h its authority, the total &s;ilence of antiquity, from the time of its &s;uppo&s;ed compo&s;ure to his day, which was at lea&s;t an hundred and fifty years, may be oppo&s;ed thereto as a counter-ba|lance.

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS and REMARKS on the foregoing te&s;timonies.</HEAD>
<P>UPON a review of the above pa&s;&s;ages, nothing is more evident than that Poly|carp &s;peaks only of two orders of officers in the church at Philippi; in which he
<PB N="176" REF="012009_0185_0F8940CC6D451C80">
remarkably harmoni&s;es with Clement of Rome: only, whereas Clement promi&s;|cuou&s;ly makes u&s;e of the names, Bi&s;hop and Pre&s;byter to &s;ignify the highe&s;t, or fir&s;t, of the&s;e orders, Polycarp confines him&s;elf to the term Pre&s;byter, not &s;o much as once naming the word Bi&s;hop, any where in his epi&s;tle. Nor is there a le&s;s agreement between Polycarp, and the Apo&s;|tle Paul upon this head: only, whereas the Apo&s;tle Paul, in writing to this church at Philippi, &s;peaks of its officers in the &s;tile of "Bi&s;hops and Deacons;" Poly|carp alters the denomination, mentioning the fir&s;t of the&s;e orders, under the name of "Pre&s;byters." And as they both in|tend one and the &s;ame order of officers, the change of &s;tile, in which they &s;peak of them, is a &s;ignal illu&s;tration of the Pre&s;byterian glo&s;s upon the Apo&s;tle's words; as well as a good argument, that, in the language of the&s;e times, the terms Bi&s;hop and Pre&s;byter meant preci&s;ely the &s;ame order of eccle&s;ia&s;tical officers.</P>
<P>NOR does Polycarp barely mention Pre&s;|byters as the highe&s;t of the two orders
<PB N="177" REF="012009_0186_0F8940CD2CDD4678">
he takes notice of, in the church at Phi|lippi; but he likewi&s;e &s;peaks of the&s;e Pre&s;byters, as having devolved on them the "in&s;pection and rule" of the church. He therefore exhorts the Philippians "to be &s;ubject to their Pre&s;byters;" and the Pre&s;byters he exhorts, "to ab&s;tain from re&s;pect of per&s;ons and unrighteous judg|ment; not ha&s;tily believing a report again&s;t any man; not being rigid in judg|ment:" which plainly &s;uppo&s;es them, in his opinion, to have been ve&s;ted with the power of eccle&s;ia&s;tical di&s;cipline: and this, without any per&s;on of a &s;uperior or|der at their head. For it happens here, as in the epi&s;tle of Clement, there is a total &s;ilence about the Bi&s;hop of this church. Neither his name, or authority, are once mentioned: nor is there, through the whole epi&s;tle, &s;o much as a glance, lead|ing our thoughts to any per&s;on, related to this church, of &s;uperior authority to the Pre&s;byters of it.</P>
<P>THE reply &s;ometimes made to this is, perhaps the Bi&s;hop was dead. But what intimation is there, the epi&s;tle, or el&s;ewhere, that he was ever alive? It
<PB N="178" REF="012009_0187_0F8940CF2F9EA898">
ought fir&s;t to be proved, and not taken for granted, that he once had exi&s;tence; before it will, in rea&s;on, account for the &s;ilence there is about him, to &s;ay he was dead. Nor is it conceivable, if this had really been the ca&s;e, but Polycarp would have offered the Philippians matter of comfort under &s;o heavy a lo&s;s: at lea&s;t, he might have wi&s;hed them another Bi|&s;hop, or recommended it to them, to take care to get his place filled up.</P>
<P>IT may be worth while ju&s;t to ob&s;erve here, how frequently, according to the epi&s;co|pal &s;cheme, the primitive &s;ees were vacant by the death of their Bi&s;hops. When Clement wrote to the Corinthians, one plea is, their Bi&s;hop was dead, in order to &s;ati&s;fy for the &s;ilence there is about him. When we come to Philippi, the &s;ame an&s;wer is made; the Bi&s;hop is dead. And he was doubtle&s;s dead too in the days of the Apo&s;tle Paul: for he is as &s;ilent about him as Polycarp. The words of the ex|cellent Mr. Jame&s;on de&s;erve a place here. Says he
<Q>Philippi is no le&s;s fatal to the Epi&s;copals, than its neighbouring plains were to the Pompeians: for they are
<PB N="179" REF="012009_0188_0F8940CF6DC64AD0">
&s;tung and confounded with the very fir&s;t words of Paul to that church: and among their other wild &s;hifts, they an&s;wer, that the Bi&s;hop was often ab|&s;ent. But there was a good number of years between the writing of Paul, and that of Polycarp, to the Philippians; and yet, we &s;ee the Bi&s;hop is never come home. Why tarry the wheels of his Lord&s;hip's chariot? Hath he not &s;ped at court, that, after &s;o long ab&s;ence, there is no news of his re|turn? nor are we like ever to hear any more of him, for now (&s;ay they) he is dead.</Q></P>
<P>THERE being, in the body of this epi&s;|tle, nothing but what makes much again&s;t the cau&s;e of modern Epi&s;copacy, great &s;tre&s;s is laid upon the&s;e words in the "in&s;cription" to it, "Polycarp and the Pre&s;byters that are with him." But not|with&s;tanding all that can be made of the&s;e words, it will be impo&s;&s;ible to find in them any marks of a &s;uperiority of or|der between Polycarp, and the&s;e Pre&s;by|ters.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="012009_0189_0F8940D02CDEEC58">IT is true, Polycarp is fir&s;t mentioned, and then the other Pre&s;byters of Smyr|na: but what is this to prove his epi&s;|copal juri&s;diction, his being placed at the head of the&s;e Pre&s;byters, as an officer of di&s;tinct and &s;uperior rank? Certainly, no &s;uch thing can be collected, by any genu|ine deduction from this mode of diction. It rather plainly imports a parity of order be|tween the per&s;ons directing the epi&s;tle; for they are evidently a&s;&s;ociated as a body, without any &s;ign of di&s;tinction at all, un|le&s;s a meer primacy may be &s;o called: whereas, if Polycarp had been the epi&s;co|pal head of the Pre&s;byters of Smyrna, the in&s;cription (as the learned Salmatius ob|&s;erves) had more properly run, "Poly|carp the Bi&s;hop, and the Pre&s;byters of Smyrna:"&mdash;or rather, the epi&s;tle had been &s;ent in his own name, without any mention of the Pre&s;byters. And there is the more rea&s;on for this ob&s;ervation, if we may &s;uppo&s;e the truth of what this &s;ame author adds; namely, "There can|not be produced a &s;ingle in&s;tance, after the di&s;tinction between Bi&s;hops and Pre&s;|byters took place, of any epi&s;tle wrote by any Bi&s;hop, who, in the in&s;cription, made
<PB N="181" REF="012009_0190_0F8940D11FF94D80">
him&s;elf a co-partner with Pre&s;byters." This is evidently the ca&s;e here; the mo&s;t natural meaning of the in&s;cription being obviou&s;ly this, "Polycarp and the re&s;t of the Pre&s;byters of that college." Poly|carp plainly here joins him&s;elf with the other Pre&s;byters: they are all repre&s;ented as &s;o many co-partners in &s;ending the epi&s;tle: nor is there any di&s;tinction in|timated between them; only, Polycarp is particularly named, and fir&s;t mention|ed: which may ea&s;ily, and &s;atisfactorily, be accounted for, without going into the &s;uppo&s;ition of his being of an order in the church &s;uperior to that of Pre&s;|byters.</P>
<P>ONE great argument (exactly &s;imilar to this, from this in&s;cription) the Romani&s;ts make u&s;e of to prove "Peter's primacy," or &s;uperiority over the re&s;t of the Apo&s;|tles, is taken from his name's being fir&s;t placed in the catalogues, and narrations, we have of him and them, both in &s;crip|ture, and antiquity: to which the great Dr. Barrow (allowing the fact at lea&s;t to be &s;o con&s;tant as not to &s;eem ca&s;ual) an&s;wers,
<Q>That po&s;ition of names does
<PB N="182" REF="012009_0191_0F8940D2C4AE8068">
not argue difference of degree, or &s;upe|riority in power; any &s;mall advantage of age, &s;tanding, merit, or wealth, &s;erv|ing to ground &s;uch precedence; as common experience doth &s;hew.</Q>
Now this ob&s;ervation will help us to account for the particular, and fir&s;t, mention of Polycarp, in the in&s;cription under debate.</P>
<P>HE was probably the fir&s;t in age among the Pre&s;byters of Smyrna; being, at lea&s;t, between forty and fifty years old, when he wrote this "epi&s;tle to the Philippians." Or however this might be, he was doubt|le&s;s the fir&s;t in &s;tanding among them, that is, he was before any of them placed in the mini&s;terial office; was the &s;enior Pa&s;|tor of this church; and perhaps the very fir&s;t Pa&s;tor, the Smyrnaeans ever had fix|ed among them: to be &s;ure, no mention is made in antiquity of any one before him; but he is always placed at the head of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. Now &s;eniority of or|dination, e&s;pecially when &s;eniority of age is added thereto, is always found to be an occa&s;ion of precedence: and it is &s;o natural for it to be &s;o, that it is ordi|narily
<PB N="183" REF="012009_0192_0F8940D32E10E090">
granted without &s;o much as laying in any claim to it. And among Pa&s;tors of preci&s;ely the &s;ame order, the&s;e take place; and their names, when put into writing, are always fir&s;t mentioned: and &s;ometimes the&s;e only are mentioned, while others of more late &s;tanding are entire|ly left out.</P>
<P>BESIDES, Polycarp was one of di&s;tin|gui&s;hed per&s;onal worth; fir&s;t among the&s;e Pre&s;byters, as being, it may be, of &s;uperior endowments, both intellectual and moral: and as he was, by this means, in a more eminent manner qualified for the pa&s;toral office, his more eminent qualifications were a good ground of precedence. He might, from a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of his own &s;u|perior merit, be di&s;po&s;ed to a&s;&s;ume the fir&s;t place; and, by this means, cu&s;tom might give him po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it: or, his more &s;hining abilities might, being ob|&s;erved, procure from others a voluntary giving him the pre-eminence. "For to tho&s;e, who indi&s;putably excell in good qualities, hone&s;t and meek per&s;ons ea&s;ily will yield precedence; e&s;pecially on occa|&s;ions of public concernment, wherein it is
<PB N="184" REF="012009_0193_0F8940D3EE0F4668">
expedient the be&s;t qualified per&s;ons &s;hould be fir&s;t &s;een." And if, upon the account of his per&s;onal worth in &s;pecial, the church of Smyrna had expre&s;&s;ed a di&s;tingui&s;hing regard for Polycarp, it is nothing &s;trange: nor if the Pre&s;byters of this church had honored him as their father; had allow|ed him a primacy of order or dignity; waiting for him to lead in all public mat|ters, and name him&s;elf fir&s;t in all epi&s;tles, as the fir&s;t, or mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed per&s;on of their body, is it any more than is now commonly practi&s;ed.</P>
<P>MOREOVER, it may be worth our no|tice, Polycarp was one that had acquain|tance with the Apo&s;tles of our Lord; and, what is more, was placed in the pa&s;toral office at Smyrna, by at lea&s;t one of them: which are advantages that greatly di&s;tin|gui&s;hed him. And if, in virtue hereof, being, di&s;tingui&s;hly honored and reveren|ced, he had a&s;&s;igned him the fir&s;t place in the college of Pre&s;byters, belonging to this church, it is no more than might naturally be expected. Upon the whole,</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="012009_0194_0F8940D4AE5125B0">THERE is no rea&s;on to think, Poly|carp's being fir&s;t named, in this in&s;crip|tion, was owing to any other cau&s;e, than &s;ome or all of tho&s;e we have mentioned. To be &s;ure, it could not be becau&s;e of his epi&s;copal authority and pre-eminence, un|le&s;s the church of Smyrna was far differ|ent in its con&s;titution from the church at Philippi: and this is not in the lea&s;t probable, &s;ince there are no traces in this epi&s;tle of any &s;uperiority of order between Bi&s;hops and Pre&s;byters.</P>
<P>THERE is but one objection, what I have offered is liable to, that I know of: and this is, that Polycarp is &s;poken of, in an|tiquity, as Bi&s;hop of Smyrna; which be|ing con&s;idered at the &s;ame time that we read this in&s;cription, it will naturally lead us to con&s;true his particularly naming him&s;elf; and this, before the Pre&s;byters, as &s;ignifying his being of an order &s;upe|rior to them.</P>
<P>BUT as the whole weight of this ob|jection (if there be any at all in it) de|pends intirely upon the true import of the word Bi&s;hop, in the age of Polycarp,
<PB N="186" REF="012009_0195_0F8940D56F558208">
there is no rea&s;on to be moved by it: &s;ince we &s;hall &s;ee in the&s;e papers (which are through the whole of them an an&s;|wer to it) full evidence, that this word, in this age, was certainly &s;ynonimous with the word Pre&s;byter, and u&s;ed to &s;ignify nothing more than preci&s;ely the &s;ame order of church officers.</P>

<HEAD>IGNATIUS.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">His character, writings, and te&s;timonies from them, with ob&s;ervations and remarks.</HEAD>
<P>THE name, epithet, or whatever el&s;e any may plea&s;e to call it, given this Father, in all his epi&s;tles, is THEO|PHOROS; which, as the learned &s;ay, may be written differently accented: either THEOPH&Oacute;ROS, meaning, a "divine per|&s;on," one who "carried God in his brea&s;t;" or THE&Oacute;PHOROS &s;ignifying a per|&s;on "carried by God." The generality of tho&s;e, who entertain a favorable opi|nion of Ignatius's "epi&s;tles," think he was ordinarily &s;poken of, in the age in which he lived, in the &s;tile of THEOPHO|ROS;
<PB N="188" REF="012009_0197_0F8940D6EE966C10">
and that this name was applied to him, in the fir&s;t of the above &s;en&s;es, on account of his great piety, his "&s;oul's being full of God." But both the&s;e points may, with good rea&s;on, be called in que&s;|tion. It is undoubted fact, that he is never mentioned by any of the truly pri|mitive Fathers in the &s;tile of THEO|PHOROS. And what may be worth no|tice, tho&s;e, among the later ones, who give him this name, do, at the &s;ame time, &s;peak of him as the "child" our Savi|or "took up into his arms," and "&s;at before his di&s;ciples" as a pattern of hu|mility. And this is the &s;pecial rea&s;on they a&s;&s;ign of the application of this name. But, as the greate&s;t admirers of Ignatius e&s;teem this a fabulous &s;tory, falling in with Chry&s;o&s;tom, who &s;ays of this Father, that he never &s;aw our Lord, nor enjoyed any conver&s;e with him," the name THEOPHOROS, founded on it, ought not to be a&s;cribed to him. And, probably, it was not originally in&s;erted in the "in&s;criptions" to his "epi&s;tles;" unle&s;s we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e them &s;purious, and not wrote until the fable it&s;elf, that is the foundation of this name, in this &s;en&s;e, began to obtain a currency.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="012009_0198_0F8940D7B2C05AF8">IT is &s;aid, in &s;upport of the other rea|&s;on of the application of this name, that it &s;eems to have been the very one, Igna|tius him&s;elf is repre&s;ented to have given, in the extant account we have of his "martyrdom." For being a&s;ked, "Who was THEOPHOROS?" His reply was, "He who has Chri&s;t in his brea&s;t." From whence it is &s;uppo&s;ed, that he was com|monly known by this name, and for this rea&s;on. But, as "the acts of the mar|tyrdom of Ignatius" are no where quo|ted, mentioned, or &s;o much as referred to, in any manner whatever, by any Father, until we have got into tho&s;e times that were greatly remote from his day, they mu&s;t be acknowledged to be, at lea&s;t, of dubious authority, and not to be depend|ed on in point of argument.&mdash;But it would take up too much room, to lit|tle purpo&s;e, to enlarge here.</P>
<P>WHETHER Ignatius was called Theo|phoros or not; or whatever was the rea|&s;on of giving him this name, we are whol|ly at a lo&s;s to know, where he was born; how educated; when, and by what means, converted to the Chri&s;ti|an faith. And, in truth, the ancient
<PB N="190" REF="012009_0199_0F8941A16DD805E0">
records are &s;urprizingly &s;ilent about him; &s;eldom mentioning &s;o much as his name, until we come into the fourth cen|tury. He is highly celebrated by mo|dern writers; and were we to judge, from the honorary manner, in which they &s;peak of him, we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e, that he was not only the mo&s;t pious and holy man, but the mo&s;t faithful, and &s;ignally accom|pli&s;hed go&s;pel-mini&s;ter, that ever lived. This, po&s;&s;ibly, may be his ju&s;t character; but none can &s;ay that it is upon any other foot, than that of meer conjecture.</P>
<P>HE is commonly &s;poken of as Bi&s;hop of Antioch; but it ought to be remem|bered, that Origin, a writer in the third century, is the fir&s;t Father that mentions him under this character. He is follow|ed by the &s;ucceeding Fathers, in the &s;e|veral ages in which they re&s;pectively flou|ri&s;hed. And when they &s;peak of him in the &s;tile of Bi&s;hop, they doubtle&s;s took into the meaning of the word, the whole that was under&s;tood by it in their day. But this will, by no means, let us into the true idea of this term, as u&s;ed in the days of Ignatius. It is readily conced|ed, he was Bi&s;hop of Antioch; but utter|ly
<PB N="191" REF="012009_0200_0F8941A22D7062A0">
denied, that he was Bi&s;hop of this church in the &s;en&s;e, in which this word was u&s;ed, either in the age of Origen, or in tho&s;e ages that followed after. He might as properly be called the Pa&s;tor, the fir&s;t, or mo&s;t eminent Pre&s;byter, or Elder, of that church, as the Bi&s;hop of it; for nothing more was meant by the word Bi&s;hop, in the age in which Igna|tius flouri&s;hed.</P>
<P>IT may properly be ob&s;erved here, the different account the Fathers give of the order, or place, of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the church of Antioch, makes a difficulty not unlike that of Clement's &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the church of Rome. The difficulty is, where to place Ignatius in the line of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; &s;ome of the Fathers putting Euodius be|fore him, and others placing Ignatius next after &s;ome Apo&s;tle. The Epi&s;copalians are much puzzled to &s;olve this matter, and go into very different &s;chemes, which it is not my bu&s;ine&s;s, at pre&s;ent, to ex|amine.</P>

known, how he executed this tru&s;t: though it may, in general, be charitably thought, that he approved him&s;elf a faith|ful Mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t; as he couragi|ou&s;ly cho&s;e to die rather than di&s;own his Ma&s;ter and Lord. There is no room to doubt his having laid down his life for the &s;ake of the religion of Je&s;us; but as to the manner and circum&s;tances of his death, as related in the "acts of his mar|tyrdom," it may be ju&s;tly que&s;tioned, whether full credit is due to them. In &s;pecial, it is difficult to think that he &s;hould be &s;ent from Antioch to &s;uffer at Rome. The mo&s;t able writers are at a lo&s;s to account for this; and &s;ome look upon it as plainly an incredible &s;tory. The great Jame&s;on has this opinion of it. Says he,
<Q>Why &s;hould Trajan be at the pains to &s;end him guarded thi|ther? Certainly not for an entertain|ment to the people, as the pretended "acts of Ignatius" affirm. They had &s;tore of Chri&s;tians of all &s;orts at Rome, with the &s;pectacle of who&s;e &s;ufferings they might daily be cloyed. Neither, as &s;ome an&s;wer, becau&s;e he was a famous Chri&s;tian Bi&s;hop, at who&s;e death the Roman Chri&s;tians might be terrified;

&s;eeing the Emperor might conclude, from Ignatius's great re&s;olution and boldne&s;s, which him&s;elf had perceived, that he would much animate them. But the perpetual practice of the&s;e times frees us from further debate herein. I can never find, that the Ro|mans brought Chri&s;tians from A&s;ia, or &s;uch remote places, to be executed at Rome; but to the neare&s;t &s;eats of ju&s;|tice; as is clear in Polycarp, and other mo&s;t famous Bi&s;hops, or Pa&s;tors.</Q>
He goes on, quoting a pa&s;&s;age from Dr. Stil|lingfleet, in the&s;e words, <Q>And truly the &s;tory of Ignatius, as much as it is de|fended with his epi&s;tles, doth not &s;eem to be any of the mo&s;t probable. For wherefore &s;hould Ignatius, of all others, be brought to Rome to &s;uffer? when the Pro-Con&s;uls, and the Prae&s;ides Provin|ciarum, did every where, in the time of per&s;ecution, execute their power in puni&s;hing of Chri&s;tians at their own tribunals, without &s;ending them &s;o long a journey to Rome to be martyr|ed there.</Q>
&mdash;But however it might be as to this, and other circum&s;tances, the fact it&s;elf, that he died a martyr, is not di&s;puted.</P>

<P>No le&s;s than fifteen "Epi&s;tles" go un|der the name of Ignatius; and they have commonly been divided into three cla&s;&s;es. The fir&s;t contains the three epi&s;tles that are extant only in latin, and wrote, one of them to the "Virgin Mary," the other two to "St. John." The &s;econd compre|hends the five Greek epi&s;tles, which are not mentioned either by Eu&s;ebius, or Jerom. The fir&s;t, to "Mary Ca&s;&s;aboli|ta;" the &s;econd, to the inhabitants of

Tar&s;us;" the third "to the Antiochians;" the fourth, "to Hero," Deacon of the church at Antioch;" the fifth, "to the Philippians." A few Roman-catholic writers give credit to the&s;e epi&s;tles, as wrote by Ignatius; but they are herein univer&s;ally oppo&s;ed by Epi&s;copalian pro|te&s;tants, as well as others, who look up|on them as evidently &s;uppo&s;ititious. The third cla&s;s compri&s;es the &s;even epi&s;tles &s;uppo&s;ed to be taken notice of by Eu&s;e|bius; which are the following ones. The fir&s;t, "to the Ephe&s;ians;" the &s;econd, "to the Magne&s;ians;" the third, "to the Trallians;" the fourth, "to the Ro|mans;" the fifth, "to the Philadel|phians;" the &s;ixth, "to the Smyrnae|ans;" the &s;eventh "to Polycarp." N. B. Arch-Bi&s;hop U&s;her, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This noted Antiquary was clearly and fully of the opini|on, that the "epi&s;tle to Polycarp," which is reckoned among, and makes up, the &s;even "epi&s;tles of Ignatius," is fal&s;ely attributed to him; as he &s;uppo&s;es, this ve|nerable Father wrote no peculiar epi&s;tle to Polycarp, but that his "epi&s;tle to the church of Smyrna" was wrote, both to them and their Bi&s;hop, and directed joint|ly to them both. And he was in no doubt, but that this was the &s;entiment of Jerom al&s;o.

<P>THESE &s;even epi&s;tles, it may be ob&s;erv|ed, are again con&s;idered in two views. The fir&s;t exhibits them in the editions that were publi&s;hed before the days of the celebrated U&s;her and Vo&s;&s;ius; and thus con&s;idered, they are &s;tiled the "larger epi&s;tles," and are now almo&s;t univer&s;ally given up as incapable of a defence, on account of the CORRUP|TIONS that have &s;ome how or other un|happily got mixed with them: though it ought always to be kept in remem|brance, that the former advocates for Prelacy, who had no other editions but the&s;e, &s;trenuou&s;ly pleaded for them as the genuine valuable remains of the truly primitive Ignatius, and appealed to them as &s;uch, in the cau&s;e of Epi&s;copacy, per|haps with as much frequency, and zeal, as any of their Epi&s;copal brethren have done &s;ince.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="012009_0206_0F8941A6ACFB5D98">THE other view we have of the&s;e epi&s;|tles is, as they are &s;et forth by Arch-Bi|&s;hop U&s;her, from two latin copies he met with in England, one in the library of Caius college, the other in the library of Bi&s;hop Montague; and by the learned Vo&s;&s;ius, from a Greek manu&s;cript copy he found in the Florentine library. Con|&s;idered in this view, they are called the "&s;horter epi&s;tles," and repre&s;ented as both genuine and uncorrupted. They are accordingly the only ones now re|paired to, in proof of the &s;uperiority of Bi&s;hops to Pre&s;byters in order and pow|er. &mdash;May it not be pertinently queried here. Do not Epi&s;copalians evidently con|demn them&s;elves, while they zealou&s;ly adhere to <HI>the&s;e,</HI> and reject the <HI>former</HI> edi|tions of the "Ignatian epi&s;tles?" They would not be wrought upon, by any me|thods of rea&s;oning, to give up "epi&s;tles" they now acknowledge to be ba&s;ely in|terlarded with corruption, until they had got them, from other manu&s;cripts, in a &s;tate they could better defend. Does it not look, as though they imagined their cau&s;e &s;tood in ab&s;olute need of Ignatius, and were willing to part with him in the former editions, only becau&s;e they have
<PB N="198" REF="012009_0207_0F8941A76D758320">
others to &s;ub&s;titute in their room, that have not &s;o glaring an appearance of a ba&s;e mixture.? One can &s;carce help thinking, if other editions &s;hould be &s;et forth, from &s;till other manu&s;cripts, more defen&s;ible than the&s;e they now have, they would as readily quit the&s;e, as they have done the former ones.</P>
<P>BUT however pure and uncorrupt the&s;e "&s;horter epi&s;tles," publi&s;hed from the more lately di&s;covered manu&s;cripts, are &s;uppo&s;ed to be, there are &s;ome, and of the fir&s;t character too for learning, who have openly declared it to be their opinion, that they are SPURIOUS; and a &s;till grea|ter number are per&s;uaded they have been corrupted, if they are not &s;purious, to a degree that unfits them to be appealed to, as exhibiting the real &s;en&s;e of the true Ignatius.</P>
<P>THE &s;trange &s;ilence of primitive antiqui|ty concerning "epi&s;tles," under the name of Ignatius, is mentioned by &s;ome, in|timately acquainted with the Fathers, as a &s;ufficient rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that he ne|ver wrote any. There is no di&s;pute about the fact it&s;elf namely, that none
<PB N="199" REF="012009_0208_0F8941A82CC88210">
of the Fathers, who&s;e works are &s;till re|maining, in whole, or in part, give no|tice of "epi&s;tles" wrote by IGNATIUS, either a le&s;s or greater number, until we come into the fourth century, three only ex|cepted; of whom we &s;hall particularly &s;peak, in &s;ome proper place, afterwards. But then the plea is, this is a <HI>negative</HI> ar|gument, and proves nothing. It is ac|knowledged, <HI>negative evidence,</HI> con&s;idered in it&s;elf nakedly, is of no great weight. But &s;till, this kind of evidence may be &s;o attended with circum&s;tances as to yield conviction, not much &s;hort of that which is grounded on po&s;itive proof. Should a pretended writing be &s;o circum&s;tanced, in regard of its &s;uppo&s;ed author, &s;ubject-matter, occa&s;ion, and manner of penning, as that there would be as much rea&s;on to expect, it &s;hould be taken notice of by tho&s;e, who mu&s;t be thought to have been acquainted with it, as other writings of the &s;ame age; and they are commemo|rated, while this is &s;ilently pa&s;&s;ed over with neglect, not by here and there a Fa|ther, but the whole body of writers for two hundred years:&mdash;the&s;e are circum|&s;tances of no &s;mall importance, and add &s;trength to a <HI>negative</HI> te&s;timony, rendering
<PB N="200" REF="012009_0209_0F8941A8EC1C09B8">
it almo&s;t equal in force to that which is po&s;itive. Now, this is the ca&s;e re|&s;pecting the&s;e "Ignatian epi&s;tles." For it ought to be remembered, and con&s;i|dered,</P>
<P>IGNATIUS lived in the fir&s;t age of Chri&s;tianity, was per&s;onally known to, at lea&s;t, &s;ome of the Apo&s;tles, and many of tho&s;e who had been familiarly conver&s;ant with them. And he was con&s;tituted, if we may believe the Epi&s;copalians, by one of the Apo&s;tles, at lea&s;t, Bi&s;hop of the church of Antioch, a noted city in it&s;elf, and remarkable on account of its being the place, where believers were fir&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of CHRISTI|ANS. The&s;e are circum&s;tances, leaving it indi&s;putable, that Ignatius was no ob|&s;cure per&s;on, but as likely to be known as any in that day. Be&s;ides all this, he was a glorious martyr for the religion of Je&s;us; and, if he really wrote the&s;e epi&s;|tles, the circum&s;tances of his martyr|dom were truly extraordinary. For he was condemned at Antioch, to die at Rome. And, in order to the execution of this &s;entence, was conveyed, by a band of &s;oldiers, as a pri&s;oner of death for the
<PB N="201" REF="012009_0210_0F8941A9AB5C20D0">
&s;ake of Chri&s;t, through all the places, in which his name was named, that lay in the way between the greatly di|&s;tant cities from each other, Antioch and Rome. This is a circum&s;tance that would naturally &s;pread his fame, and occa&s;ion his being held in veneration by all the Chri&s;tian churches, as he pa&s;&s;ed along. Had he been before a per&s;on of no figure, this alone would have given him an exalted reputation: nor is it &s;up|po&s;eable, that any of the Fathers, of the &s;ame age, &s;hould be more exten&s;ively known, or more frequently &s;poken of with honor. The&s;e are the circum&s;tan|ces under which we are to conceive of the author of the&s;e "epi&s;tles."</P>
<P>AND as extraordinary ones attend the "epi&s;tles" them&s;elves; for they were wrote (if wrote by him) in the character of one that was a pri&s;oner, in bonds, for the name of Chri&s;t, and actually on his journey to be devoured by wild bea&s;ts: nor were they wrote to private friends, upon meer private concerns; but to no le&s;s than &s;ix as famous churches as were then in the world; and, if we may be|lieve the Epi&s;copalians, upon matters of
<PB N="202" REF="012009_0211_0F8941AB52139BF8">
the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential importance. The&s;e, &s;urely, are con&s;iderations that will not &s;uffer us to think, that the&s;e "epi&s;tles" were unknown, or not e&s;teemed worthy of particular notice. Epi&s;tles wrote, and &s;ent, to a number of &s;uch noted chur|ches, by &s;o good and great a Bi&s;hop, up|on the mo&s;t weighty points, at &s;o &s;olemn a time as that of his dying for the cau&s;e of Chri&s;t, mu&s;t have occa&s;ioned much talk among Chri&s;tians. They would have put a di&s;tingui&s;hing value upon &s;uch epi&s;tles; yea, they would have e&s;teemed them the mo&s;t celebrated monuments of all unin|&s;pired antiquity. How unaccountable then is it, that &s;o little notice &s;hould be taken of them, for the full &s;pace of two hundred years after the &s;uppo&s;ed date of their compo&s;ure! And what makes the matter &s;till more &s;trange is, that nothing more frequently occurs, than the menti|on of other writings of the &s;ame age with the&s;e. There is &s;carce an author, about the time in which Ignatius flouri&s;hed, but his works are particularly named, or quoted. And why &s;hould Ignatius, the mo&s;t celebrated of them all, be &s;hame|fully treated with &s;ilence and neglect? And this is the more to be wondered at,
<PB N="203" REF="012009_0212_0F8941ABEBF3D0D8">
as his writings were, in &s;ome ca&s;es, the mo&s;t pertinent that could have been referred to; far more &s;o than other wri|tings that are particularly mentioned, and remembered with honor.</P>
<P>BUT the force of this <HI>negative</HI> argu|ment will appear in a yet &s;tronger point of light, if, by way of &s;pecimen, we par|ticularly con&s;ider one or two of the an|cient writers, who take no notice of the&s;e "epi&s;tles."</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t &s;hall be Irenaeus. We have extant of his a large volume, entitled, "the confutation of that which is fal&s;e|ly called knowledge;" the main de&s;ign of which is, to explain and refute the erronious notions of Simon, Menander, Valentinus, Marcion, Cerinthus, Cer|don," and as many other heretics as had appeared in his day, and for an hundred years before. In &s;uch a work as this, of &s;o great length, and &s;uch variety of mat|ter and argument, it might well be ex|pected, &s;ome mention would have been made of &s;o celebrated a writer, and mar|tyr, as Ignatius, who both wrote and died in this very age: e&s;pecially, if it be
<PB N="204" REF="012009_0213_0F8941ACAC31C438">
con&s;idered, that his "epi&s;tles" are peculiarly pertinent to the great de&s;ign of Irenaeus's argument, more &s;o by far than any other ancient writing, we know any thing of, then extant in the world. For &s;ome (perhaps the mo&s;t) of tho&s;e very errors he oppo&s;es, were both noted and rejected by Ignatius. I need not be at the pains to produce in&s;tances of this for the &s;ake of tho&s;e, who are acquainted with the&s;e wri|tings; and for others, if they will only compare the "Ignatian epi&s;tles", with the fir&s;t of "Irenaeus's five books", they may, with their own eyes, &s;ee a number of them. What therefore more natural than to look for references to "the&s;e epi&s;|tles", in the works of Irenaeus? And how can it be accounted for, that he &s;hould take no notice of them, but that he knew of no &s;uch epi&s;tles? Had he con|fined him&s;elf to rea&s;on, or &s;cripture, in confutation of the&s;e heretics, having no recour&s;e to former writers, it would be &s;ome apology for his &s;ilence: but, far from this, one of his chief arguments is taken from "the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of doctrine in the Chri&s;tian church;" in order to confirm which, he recurs to the WRIT|INGS, as well as SAYINGS, of tho&s;e who
<PB N="205" REF="012009_0214_0F8941AD6C381568">
were older than the heretics he was re|futing. He makes a very particular and honorable mention of CLEMENT, and his "epi&s;tle to the Corinthians," and oppo&s;es even the whole of it again&s;t the here&s;ies he had under con&s;ideration. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. iii. Cap. iii.</NOTE> And yet, not a word is &s;aid, either here, or el&s;e|where, in his whole book, in commemo|ration of "Ignatius's epi&s;tles;" nor is there one word quoted from him to the purpo&s;e of the grand argument he has in pro&s;ecution.</P>
<P>THE an&s;wer to this is, That, in the place where Irenaeus mentions "Cle|ment," he had, to prevent being tedious, expre&s;&s;ly limited him&s;elf to "the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of doctrine in the church at Rome," of which Clement had been Bi&s;hop; and as, in the name of that church, he had wrote an "epi&s;tle to the Corinthians," wherein the doctrine of that church, and its op|po&s;ition to the doctrine of the&s;e heretics, might be ea&s;ily di&s;cerned, there was good rea&s;on, why he &s;hould di&s;tingui&s;h Cle|ment; a pertinency in appealing to him, while there would have been none in
<PB N="206" REF="012009_0215_0F8941AE2C13A160">
appealing to Ignatius. But, it is ob&s;erva|ble, in this very place, where he had con|fined his argument to the church of Rome, he takes occa&s;ion to commemorate "Po|lycarp's epi&s;tle to the Philippians." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. iii. Cap. iii.</NOTE> And why might he not, with as much propri|ety, have taken &s;ome notice of the "epi&s;|tles of Ignatius?" To this al&s;o it is re|plied, Irenaeus introduces the mention he makes of Polycarp, by &s;aying, he had been at Rome, where he oppo&s;ed the&s;e heretics, and recovered many from the errors wherewith they had been infected: upon which account it was to his purpo&s;e to name Polycarp, while there was no rea|&s;on, at this time, to mention Ignatius. But, it de&s;erves con&s;ideration, over and above mentioning Polycarp's being at Rome, and confuting the Heretics there, which was the only point directly to his argument, he takes occa&s;ion to celebrate his "epi&s;tle to the Philippians". There is little, or nothing, in this epi&s;tle to the de&s;ign he was upon, and accordingly he makes no u&s;e of it, or any &s;entence in it, to oppo&s;e the heretics: yet, this primitive Father having an epi&s;tle extant,
<PB N="207" REF="012009_0216_0F8941AEED503070">
he could not forbear making a record of it. And it might have been as pro|per, and pertinent, even in this very place, to have done the like by the "epi&s;tles of Ignatius. For it is particularly worthy of notice, Ignatius had been at Rome as well as Polycarp; and, what is more, died there a glorious martyr in the cau&s;e of Chri&s;t: Nor &s;hould it be forgot, that "the&s;e epi&s;tles," as Epi&s;copalians tell us, were collected by Polycarp, at lea&s;t, &s;ome of them, and annexed by him to his "own epi&s;tle" as part of one and the &s;ame volume. Irenaeus, therefore, having men|tioned "Polycarp's epi&s;tle", would, it may rea&s;onably and naturally be &s;uppo&s;ed, have mentioned the others al&s;o under the &s;ame cover, if he had known of them; and the rather, becau&s;e they were the work of &s;o eminent a primitive Father, and of all the writings, then extant, the be&s;t adapted to confound the heretics he was arguing again&s;t.</P>
<P>BUT &s;hould it be allowed, that, in this particular place, while his argument was under a &s;pecial limitation, it was more proper to take notice of the "epi&s;tles of Clement and Polycarp", than of "Ignatius";
<PB N="208" REF="012009_0217_0F8941AFAD5D1538">
yea, that there was good rea&s;on for men|tioning the former, and none at all for the latter; yet, what is this to account for the &s;ilence there every where el&s;e ap|pears concerning the&s;e epi&s;tles? Becau&s;e it was more proper in one place to men|tion Clement and Polycarp, than Igna|tius, will it therefore follow there was a propriety in making no mention of him at all? If this was a proper place to &s;peak of Clement, and Polycarp, might he not, in &s;ome other place, have done the like honor to Ignatius? And his &s;i|lence with re&s;pect to this mo&s;t noted Fa|ther, is the more &s;trange, as he has found &s;ome &s;uitable place to remember, not only Clement, and Polycarp, but Her|mas, Ignatius's contemporary, and Pa|pias, and Ju&s;tin, not a great way po&s;terior to him. Surely, no one, who e&s;teems "Ig|natius's epi&s;tles to be genuine, will &s;ay, that Irenaeus had more rea&s;on, or could with greater propriety, record the wri|tings of the&s;e Fathers, than tho&s;e of the more famed and memorable Ignatius. Be&s;ides all which, it may be worth minding, that nothing is more common with Irenaeus, than to have recour&s;e to the &s;ayings, both ORAL and WRITTEN, of tho&s;e Elders
<PB N="209" REF="012009_0218_0F8941B06DC65A70">
who preceeded him. "As a certain El|der &s;ays," "as was &s;aid by the Pre&s;by|ters," "as I heard from &s;uch a Senior," "as was delivered by tho&s;e who were di&s;ciples of the Apo&s;tles," are phra&s;es very familiar with him. He often, in this manner, introduces the words of the ancients. And yet, in &s;o many referen|ces, he never makes u&s;e of &s;o much as a &s;ingle &s;entence from Ignatius, to his grand purpo&s;e, that of refuting the he|retics; though, in mo&s;t of his epi&s;tles, there was that which was well adapted to &s;uch a de&s;ign. It certainly looks, as if he knew nothing of "the&s;e epi&s;tles": if he had, he mu&s;t needs have dropped, at lea&s;t, &s;ome hint about them, &s;omewhere or other, in &s;o large a work.</P>
<P>I SHALL next mention Clement of Alexandria; a per&s;on of va&s;t learning, &s;econd to none in the age in which he lived, for his acquaintance with all &s;orts of writers. Tho&s;e works of his that are &s;till in being are crouded with an immen&s;e variety of quotations from philo&s;ophers, poets, hi&s;torians, and all kinds of wri|ters, whether Pagan or Chri&s;tian. He particularly mentions the "epi&s;tle of
<PB N="210" REF="012009_0219_0F8941B12CD12CD0">
Barnabas," the "epi&s;tle of Clement of Rome," the "pa&s;tor of Hermas," all writers in the age in which Ignatius liv|ed. And if the "Ignatian epi&s;tles" had been extant in his day, one of his pro|digious learning mu&s;t have had know|ledge of it; and if he had, it is &s;carce credible he &s;hould have pa&s;&s;ed them over in &s;ilence. He often takes occa&s;ion to &s;peak of the heretics that corrupted the Chri&s;tian faith; and there being &s;o much in Ignatius upon this head, it is really &s;trange, he &s;hould never once comme|morate &s;o famous a writer, and martyr. It is quite natural to think, he had ne|ver &s;een, or heard of "epi&s;tles" under the name of Ignatius.</P>
<P>AND the &s;ame may be &s;aid of Tertul|lian, and other writers, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It may not be unworthy of notice, that, among the nu|merous writings of the Fathers, which are now lo&s;t, but were extant in the days of Eu&s;ebius, and red by him, he has named no one that &s;peaks of Ignatius as having wrote "epi&s;tles": from whence it may be fairly concluded, that they made no mention of epi&s;tles of his, any more than tho&s;e which have been handed down to us. For nothing more common with Eu&s;ebius, than to cite pa&s;&s;ages from the writings that are now lo&s;t, and pa&s;&s;ages too which mention the names of writers con-temporary with Ignatius, and po&s;terior to him. It is therefore to the highe&s;t degree probable, if Eu&s;ebius had met with any writers before his own day, who had mentioned epi&s;tles of Ig|natius, that he would have given us, at lea&s;t, &s;ome inti|mation of it. It is ob&s;ervable, he has pre&s;erved a frag|ment of an anonymous author, [&s;ome think Maximus, for rea&s;ons it would be needle&s;s to in&s;ert here] in which he &s;ays, in confutation of the here&s;y of Artemon, who held that "Chri&s;t was only a meer man," that it was "fir&s;t of all oppo&s;ed by the holy &s;criptures, and next by the books of &s;undry men long before the time of Victor, I mean Ju&s;tin, Miltiades, Tatian, Clement, Ire|naeus, Melito, and many others;" H. E. Lib. v. Cap. xviii. No notice is here taken of Ignatius, in who&s;e epi&s;tles, if his, in tho&s;e editions of them that are contend|ed for, this here&s;y of Artemon is as directly and fully condemned, as by any of the writers who&s;e names are particularly mentioned. Surely, if this author had known of the&s;e epi&s;tles, he would not have omitted to refer to them, when it would have been &s;o pertinent to the argument he was upon. And it mu&s;t be acknowledg|ed, to be altogether unaccountable, if epi&s;tles of Ignati|us had been mentioned, or quoted, in any of the writings now lo&s;t, but in being in the days of Eu&s;ebius, and &s;een and celebrated by him, that he &s;hould pa&s;s over &s;o im|portant an article in total &s;ilence; e&s;pecially, as it would have been &s;o much to his purpo&s;e to have been particular in taking notice of it.</NOTE> between the days

<P>IT is thought a &s;trong confirmation of this te&s;timony from Polycarp, that Eu&s;ebius, when &s;peaking of the "Igna|tian epi&s;tles," as commemorated by him, quotes from him this pa&s;&s;age in the ori|ginal Greek, which exhibits the very idea that is conveyed by the above ancient ver&s;ion.</P>
<P>UPON this "Polycarpian te&s;timony" it may be ob&s;erved, that the whole para|graph, from whence it is taken, is &s;u&s;|pected to have been an after addition, de|&s;igned to give credit to the "Ignatian epi&s;tles". And two things are offered in &s;upport of &s;uch a &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t is, its apparent abrupt|ne&s;s, and want of relation to the fore|going di&s;cour&s;e. There is no connection between this, and what went before: nor had Polycarp dropped any hint, that would lead one to expect this notice of "Ignatius epi&s;tles": and what is &s;aid, with reference to them, is &s;o in&s;erted, as
<PB N="215" REF="012009_0224_0F8941B5AC079F28">
to its manner, that no one, when he had read the foregoing words, could begin upon the&s;e without naturally making a pau&s;e, as meeting with what he had no rea&s;on given him to look for. Some, of great intimacy with the ancient wri|tings, have, from this con&s;ideration on|ly, been inclined to &s;u&s;pect, that the pa&s;|&s;age was unfairly crouded into the epi&s;|tle. &mdash;But I only mention this as a cir|cum&s;tance, that may give weight to what may be further offered of greater im|portance.</P>
<P>The other ground of &s;u&s;picion there|fore is, an apparent incon&s;i&s;tency, or contradiction, between what is affirmed in one of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, and another in the body of the epi&s;tle. The ninth &s;ec|tion contains the&s;e words, "Wherefore I exhort all of you to obey the word of righteou&s;ne&s;s, and exerci&s;e all patience, which ye have &s;een &s;et before your eyes, not only in the ble&s;&s;ed IGNATIUS, and Zozimus, and Rufus, but in others among your&s;elves, and in Paul him&s;elf, and the re&s;t of the Apo&s;tles: being <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Confidentes quia hi omnes non in vacuum concutrerunt, &s;ed in fide et ju&s;titia; et ad debitum &s;ibi locum a Do|mino, cui et compa&s;&s;i &s;unt, abierunt.</NOTE> confident
<PB N="216" REF="012009_0225_0F8941B66C467130">
in this, that all the&s;e have not run in vain, but in faith and righteou&s;ne&s;s; and ARE GONE TO THE PLACE DUE TO THEM FROM THE LORD, for whom they al&s;o &s;uffered".&mdash;Ignatius is &s;o evi|dently here &s;poken of, as having fi|ni&s;hed his &s;ufferings, and gone to the Lord, that there can be no rea&s;onable room for doubt in the ca&s;e. THESE ALL [HI OMNES] that is, IGNATIUS, Zo|simus, Rufus, and others, HAVE NOT RUN IN VAIN, but are GONE TO THE PLACE DUE TO THEM FROM THE LORD. No one that reads the&s;e words can be at a lo&s;s to determine, that Ignatius, in the thoughts of Polycarp, was really dead, and actually gone to the place of future rewards. And yet, this very Ignatius is here directly &s;uppo&s;ed to be alive, and not come to his la&s;t &s;ufferings. "Sig|nify to me what ye know about IGNA|TIUS, and THOSE THAT ARE WITH HIM." Is not this a manner of &s;peak|ing altogether ab&s;urd, unle&s;s it had been pre&s;umed, that Ignatius was yet alive? The mo&s;t plain &s;ignification of the words is, that this was the real truth. Can it now be imagined, that Polycarp, after he had &s;poken of Ignatius as actually
<PB N="217" REF="012009_0226_0F8941B72D508A48">
dead, and recommended his &s;ufferings and death as an example to others, &s;hould, in the &s;ame &s;hort epi&s;tle, &s;peak of him as alive, and de&s;ire to know about him; and this, from the very per&s;ons to whom he had recommended his death as an example? This would be very &s;trange; and it would be di&s;honorary to &s;o famous a Father to &s;uppo&s;e, he &s;hould be thus incon&s;i&s;tent with him&s;elf: but it is no uncommon thing for knavi&s;h per&s;ons to do that, which, through want of cauti|on, &s;erves to di&s;cover their fraud.</P>
<P>BUT we &s;hall be able to perceive more fully the force of what has been offer|ed, if we attend a while to what has been &s;aid to weaken its &s;trength.</P>
<P>IT is pleaded, Polycarp does not, in the objected words, in&s;inuate that Igna|tius was now <HI>alive,</HI> as is pretended, in con|tradiction to what he had &s;aid of him as <HI>dead,</HI> in &s;ect. ix. But, the Philippians, being likely to know con&s;iderable about Ignatius, both while hs was alive, and while he was &s;uffering martyrdom, he writes to them, as it was proper and natural for to him to do, to communicate
<PB N="218" REF="012009_0227_0F8941B7ED74D358">
to him what they knew, both about him, and tho&s;e that were his companions. This doth not &s;eem &s;atisfactory. The que&s;tion is not, what the Philippians might know about Ignatius, nor whether it was proper for Polycarp to de&s;ire them to tell him what they knew about him? but whether the manner of writing, here u&s;ed, is not &s;uch as evidently &s;uppo&s;es Ignatius had not yet come to his la&s;t &s;uf|ferings, contrary to what he had before expre&s;&s;ly declared? The words, "&s;igni|fy to me what ye certainly know about Ignatius, and tho&s;e THAT ARE WITH HIM," obviou&s;ly &s;uppo&s;e the per&s;on wrote about to be alive. And it is ob&s;ervable, he is repre&s;ented as having his companions about him. "Ignatius, and tho&s;e that are with him;" ARE, in the pre&s;ent ten&s;e. And if Polycarp had not known that he was dead, the mode of diction is ea&s;y and natural; but uncouth, I may &s;ay unin|telligible, if compared with the firm per|&s;ua&s;ion he had before expre&s;&s;ed, that he had fini&s;hed his cour&s;e, and obtained the crown of martyrdom.</P>
<P>OTHERS endeavor to remove the difficulty another way. They argue,
<PB N="219" REF="012009_0228_0F8941B8AC189EB8">
Polycarp, when he wrote this epi&s;tle, con|cluded in his own mind, that Ignatius, by this time, had gone through his &s;uffer|ings; for which rea&s;on, he pertinently writes as in &s;ect. ix: yet, having receiv|ed no certain account of his death, and not being fully &s;atisfied, whether he had &s;uffered, or not; or, if he had, how he had been treated by his per&s;ecutors, and how he had behaved in his la&s;t encoun|ter with the bea&s;ts, de&s;ires the Philippi|ans, who were much nearer to Rome than he was, and might therefore very proba|bly have heard much later from thence then he had, to &s;end him an account of what they knew relative to the&s;e matters. And in all this, what, they &s;ay, is there, not that locks like a contradiction, but that is not very natural, and particularly mo&s;t becoming the love and friend&s;hip of the ble&s;&s;ed Polycarp towards him, concerning whom he &s;o diligently enquired? It is obvious, at fir&s;t &s;ight, that this plea di|rectly contradicts the foregoing one; and yet, it is as far from unfolding the difficulty. For, from the whole &s;train of &s;ect. ix, it appears with a meridian lu&s;tre, that Polycarp was fully per&s;uaded that Ignatius was dead, and gone to reap
<PB N="220" REF="012009_0229_0F8941B96D385EC8">
the fruit of his fidelity to his Lord. He was in no doubt as to the truth of this fact, nor needed any information about it. He &s;peaks of it as a matter that was well known both to him&s;elf, and to the Philippians: nor can words more clearly and &s;trongly &s;ignify this, than tho&s;e he has u&s;ed to the purpo&s;e. "THESE ALL," therefore IGNATIUS among the re&s;t, and as truly as Paul, and the other Apo&s;tles, "have not run in vain, but ARE with the Lord in the place due to them." And yet, according to the plea here made, it is &s;uppo&s;ed that Polycarp, in the objected words, &s;peaks of it as a matter of uncer|tainty, whether Ignatius had come to his encounter with the bea&s;ts; which is no way reconcileable with the clear per&s;ua|&s;ion of his being dead, he had before ex|pre&s;&s;ed in &s;ect. ix.</P>
<P>IT is further &s;aid, in favor of the ge|numene&s;s of this pa&s;&s;age, that no one who de&s;igned to &s;erve a turn by corrupt|ing this epi&s;tle would have been, either &s;o negligent as not carefully to read it over, or having done this, would have been &s;o fooli&s;h as to have &s;ubjoined a reque&s;t to the Philippians in direct
<PB N="221" REF="012009_0230_0F8941BA2C3801E0">
contradiction to what the true Polycarp had told them before; and which, by con&s;e|quence, mu&s;t di&s;cover the fraud, and fru&s;trate the de&s;ign in view. This, it is po&s;&s;ible, may &s;eem an argument of weight to tho&s;e unacquainted with antiquity; but it will not appear in the &s;ame light to &s;uch as are ver&s;ed in this kind of &s;tu|dy; as they have often met with like in|&s;tances of folly. Whether the per&s;ons guilty of &s;uch fraudulent dealing were commonly weak; or whether they ima|gined tho&s;e they de&s;igned to impo&s;e up|on were of this character; or whether, though artful and cunning, they were left in Providence (as is often the ca&s;e at pre&s;ent in regard of all kinds of cheats) to do that, through carele&s;&s;ne&s;s and in|attention, which &s;erves to di&s;cover their fraud, I &s;hall not pretend to &s;ay: but it is a fact notoriou&s;ly known, that WHOLE PIECES, as well as INTERPOLATED SEN|TENCES were, in tho&s;e days, obtruded upon the world, full as ridiculous as this &s;uppo&s;ed corruption can be repre&s;ented to be. Signal in&s;tances of this nature are to be met with in the "apo&s;tolical con&s;titutions and canons," which are uni|ver&s;ally allowed to have been fraudulently
<PB N="222" REF="012009_0231_0F8941BAEC152800">
dealt with, even by tho&s;e who have not an opinion of them as &s;purious. The interpolations, and additions, made in the&s;e writings, do &s;o gro&s;&s;ly break in upon the order of time, the declared mind of the Apo&s;tles in the in&s;pired books, and are &s;o often chargeable with contradict|ing other parts of the &s;ame writings, that one could &s;carce believe it po&s;&s;ible a per&s;on of common &s;en&s;e &s;hould be guilty of &s;uch ridiculous weakne&s;s, but that there is no arguing again&s;t &s;tubborn fact. The reader that is inclined to &s;ee this &s;uppo&s;ed addition to "Polycarp's epi&s;|tle" fully matched for the weakne&s;s, and folly, it is &s;aid to contain, may meet with it done to his mind, in what has been offered, under the head of "Clement's writings," in the preceeding pages. To the like purpo&s;e he may con&s;ult Dr. Smallbroke's "Clementine con&s;titutions confuted, in an&s;wer to Mr. Whi&s;ton."</P>
<P>BUT if we drop the &s;uppo&s;ition of an "interpolation," and even allow this "Polycarpian te&s;timony," to be un&s;u&s;|pectedly genuine, it will not, at once, as too many have imagined, decide the controver&s;y relative to the "Ignatian
<PB N="223" REF="012009_0232_0F8941BBABF6EDB8">
epi&s;tles. " For it does not prove what it is brought for; but leaves the greate&s;t part of " the&s;e epi&s;tles" de&s;titute of all real evidence in their &s;upport. At mo&s;t, two only of the&s;e epi&s;tles are certainly taken notice of. No more are couched under tho&s;e words of Polycarp, "the epi&s;tles of Ignatius which he &s;ent to us:" nor do the greate&s;t patrons of "Ignatius's writings" pretend, that any other are here referred to, than his "epi&s;tle to the Smyr|naeans," and a particular one to "Poly|carp him&s;elf." And as to the words that immediately follow, "and as many other epi&s;tles as we had by us;" though they are interpreted, by epi&s;copal writers, to mean " the other epi&s;tles of IGNATI|US," there is not the lea&s;t need, unle&s;s to &s;erve a turn, to look upon them as re|ferring at all to any of the "Ignatian epi&s;tles." They are generally wrote, without any limitation to Ignatius. Arch-Bi&s;hop Wake indeed has been plea|&s;ed, no le&s;s than three times <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Apo&s;t. Fathers, p. 22, 31, and in his tran&s;lation of the epi&s;tle, p. 59.</NOTE> to in&s;ert the words OF HIS, without giving the reader any notice that they were words of his own putting in; by means whereof the meer
<PB N="224" REF="012009_0233_0F8941BC6B679A50">
Engli&s;h reader, and all who have &s;een on|ly his tran&s;lation, are unavoidably led to imagine, that the words, in "Polycarp's epi&s;tle," are ab&s;olutely confined to Igna|tius; when, in truth, they are generally expre&s;&s;ed, having nothing to an&s;wer the Arch-Bi&s;hop's limiting words OF HIS. In the "old ver&s;ion" of Polycarp, the words run thus, "Epi&s;tolas &s;an&eacute; Ignatii, quae tran&s;mi&s;&s;ae &s;unt vobis [pro nobis] ab eo, et ALIAS QUANTASCUMQUE apud nos habuimus, tran&s;mi&s;&s;imus vobis, &s;ecundum quod manda&s;tis." The original Greek, as quoted by Eu&s;ebius, perfectly agrees herewith. What is tran&s;lated in the old copy, " ET ALIAS QUANTASCUMQUE," is in the Greek, KAI ALLAS OSAS. It is acknowledged, in the fir&s;t part of this pa&s;&s;age, "Epi&s;tles of Ignatius" are di|rectly mentioned; that is, the Epi&s;copa|lians them&s;elves being judges, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Epi&s;tolas &s;an&egrave; Ignatii," Arch-Bi&s;hop Wake tran&s;lates "the epi&s;tles of IGANATIUS;" and in the margin has the&s;e words, " that is, to him&s;elf, and to the church of Smyrna". Cotelerius's note upon the &s;ame words is this, "de&s;ignantur duae Ignatii epi&s;tolae: una ad Polycar|pum; altera ad Polycarpi &s;eu Smyrnem&s;em eccle&s;iam.</NOTE> two of the epi&s;tles &s;aid to be his, "one to Poly|carp;" the "other to the church of Smyr|na:" but, in the latter part of it, the
<PB N="225" REF="012009_0234_0F8941BE13ABB4A0">
words are general, and &s;o far from be|ing limited to Ignatius, that they may, with propriety, be interpreted of ANY EPISTLES WHATEVER, Polycarp, or the church of Smyrna, might have had by them, of other famous primitive Fa|thers. And there are &s;ome con&s;iderati|ons that fairly lead to &s;uch a general con&s;truction of the words. For it is plain, the&s;e epi&s;tles were &s;ent, by Poly|carp and his church, to the church at Philippi, at their de&s;ire which had been &s;ignified to them. "We have &s;ent the epi&s;tles as you de&s;ired." And it is quite ea&s;y and natural to conceive of their &s;end|ing, upon the de&s;ire of the Philippians, the "epi&s;tles" Ignatius had wrote to THEM. But how &s;hould they come by his other epi&s;tles, tho&s;e which he wrote to the "Magne&s;ians," to the "Phila|delphians," to the "Ephe&s;ians," to the "Romans," and to the "Trallians?" And why &s;hould the church at Philippi &s;end to them for the&s;e epi&s;tles? If Ig|natius had really wrote to the&s;e churches, and the Philippians had a mind to &s;ee his epi&s;tles to them, it would have been na|tural for them to have &s;ent to tho&s;e chur|ches for a copy of their re&s;pective letters;
<PB N="226" REF="012009_0235_0F8941BEACAF25E0">
and in every re&s;pect as natural as was their &s;ending to Polycarp, and his church, for the letters he wrote to them. It there|fore looks as if the "epi&s;tles", here &s;poken of, as &s;ent to the Philippians, were tho&s;e "epi&s;tles of Ignatius" which he had wrote to Polycarp, and the Smyrnaeans; and "&s;uch other epi&s;tles", of other famous per&s;ons, as they had by them, that might be of more &s;pecial value. There is no|thing in this con&s;truction of the words that appears &s;trained, or unnatural; nor is there the lea&s;t need of any other inter|pretation. And &s;hould this prove to be the true con&s;truction, only TWO of the "SEVEN Ignatian epi&s;tles" are here men|tioned. The remaining five mu&s;t be taken care of by others. Yea, &s;hould we allow of the Epi&s;copalian interpretation, the matter would not be a great deal mended. In this ca&s;e, it is true, it might be argued, that Ignatius wrote more than two epi&s;tles; but what other epi&s;tles, to whom, or how many, would, after all, remain an utter uncertainty. The words &s;pecify nothing. "And as many other epi&s;tles as we had by us:"&mdash;No|thing is here &s;aid by which it can be
<PB N="227" REF="012009_0236_0F8941BF6BED1E00">
determined, how many epi&s;tles were in|tended, nor whether any of the pre&s;ent collection were of their number.</P>
<P>BUT, if we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e all that is pleaded for this te&s;timony, from Poly|carp, to be really true, the controver&s;y about the&s;e "epi&s;tles," in point of de|pendence on them, as containing the &s;en&s;e of Ignatius, will remain &s;till un|determined. For if it be allowed, that Polycarp &s;ent a collection of "&s;even Ig|natian epi&s;tles" to the church at Philip|pi; it will not follow from hence, that the pre&s;ent collection of the like number of epi&s;tles, under the name of Igna|natius, is the &s;ame incorrupt, unadulte|rated collection with that of Polycarp's. It is granted, it was not the &s;ame before the days of U&s;her, and Vo&s;&s;ius. And, &s;ince the appearance of tho&s;e learned antiqua|ries, the ca&s;e may po&s;&s;ibly be the &s;ame; and it mu&s;t evidently be &s;o, if the collecti|on of the&s;e "epi&s;tles," in their &s;uppo&s;ed be&s;t edition, contain &s;uch things as argue a date po&s;terior to the age in which Igna|tius lived, and that are altogether unworthy of that primitive Father, and martyr:

and that they contain &s;uch things as the&s;e, we &s;hall have occa&s;ion, in its pro|per place, particularly to evince.</P>
<P>IN the mean time, let us go on to Ire|naeus, the next writer, within the &s;econd century, cited in favor of the "epi&s;tles of Ignatius". His words are the&s;e, "as one from among us SAID, being adjudg|ed to the bea&s;ts that he might be a mar|tyr for God; <HI>I am the corn of Chri&s;t, and am ground with the teeth of bea&s;ts, that I may be found the pure bread of God".</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Quemadmodum quidam de no&s;tris DIXIT, prompter martyrium in Deum adjudicatus ad be&s;tias; "quoniam frumentnm &s;um Chri&s;ti, et per dentes be&s;tiarum molor, ut mundus panis Dei inveniar." Adver&s;. Heret. Lib. v. Cap. xxviii.</NOTE> The&s;e words are found in the epi&s;tle to the Romans, under the name of Igna|tius, &s;ect. iv. And it is thought a weighty circum&s;tance attending this te&s;|timony, that Eu&s;ebius has quoted it, and after this manner; "and Irenaeus knew of his [Ignatius's] martyrdom, and makes mention of his epi&s;tles in the&s;e words, "as one among us SAID, [<HI>eipe</HI>] being ad|judged to the bea&s;ts for the te&s;timony of

<P>IN an&s;wer to this te&s;timony of Irenaeus, it is allowed, that Ignatius is the per&s;on here referred to, and that the cited words are to be &s;een in one of the extant epi&s;|tles under his name.</P>
<P>BUT this notwith&s;tanding, it does not appear &s;ufficiently evident, that Irenaeus either knew of this "epi&s;tle," or took this &s;entence out of it. It is certain, he makes no mention of the "epi&s;tle," nei|ther does he anywhere &s;ay, that he tran&s;|cribed the&s;e words from it. And it is ob&s;ervable, the words are not introduced, "as one from among us WROTE;" but "as one from among us SAID." A great deal of pains has been taken to prove, that the phra&s;e," as was &s;aid," is not on|ly proper, but frequently u&s;ed, even by Irenaeus him&s;elf, to introduce citations from known written books. And no one ever que&s;tioned its being a phra&s;e,
<PB N="230" REF="012009_0239_0F8941C1AC934528">
both proper, and commonly u&s;ed, by all kinds of authors, by which to bring in the written words of others. But the que&s;tion is, whether it is not as proper a mode of &s;peech, and as commonly u&s;ed, to introduce the <HI>vocal</HI> as the <HI>written</HI> &s;ay|ings of others? And &s;ince the point in debate is, whether Ignatius wrote the&s;e epi&s;tles, how can it be thought a &s;atis|factory proof, that he did, to bring a quotation from Irenaeus, introduced af|ter that manner," as one of us SAID?" which phra&s;e, to &s;ay the lea&s;t, is as well capable of being interpreted to refer to a VOCAL, as a WRITTEN, &s;aying? It is replied to this, the words here quoted are found in one of the <HI>written</HI> "epi&s;tles" a&s;cribed to Ignatius, which is a circum|&s;tance that ought, in all rea&s;on, to de|termine the matter, that Irenaeus took them from this "epi&s;tle." I an&s;wer, the total &s;ilence of Irenaeus about any epi&s;tles of Ignatius, when he had the faire&s;t, the mo&s;t frequent, and mo&s;t urgent occa&s;ions, to have mentioned them, is a circum&s;tance full as &s;trong to induce a belief, that he knew nothing of them. But this is not all. Nothing more common with Irenaeus, than to
<PB N="231" REF="012009_0240_0F8941C26D3C3EF8">
have recour&s;e to the VOCAL &s;ayings of tho&s;e that were ancienter than him&s;elf; and a great number of them are intro|duced, in the very &s;ame manner with the&s;e words of Ignatius, "as &s;uch an one &s;aid." And as Irenaeus was acquainted with Po|lycarp, Ignatius's contemporary, and a va&s;t number of other ancients; why might he not have received this &s;aying from them, as what had been uttered by Igna|tius, in the day of his martyrdom? nor is this meer conjecture only. For the&s;e very words are mentioned by Jerom, as delivered by Ignatius in his la&s;t &s;uffer|ings. His words are the&s;e: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Cum jam damnatus e&s;&s;et ad be&s;tias, et ardore patien|di, rugientes audiret leones, ait: frumentum Chri&s;ti &s;um, dentibus be&s;tiarum molor, ut panis mundus in|veniar." Vid. lib. de viris illu&s;t. Cap. 16.</NOTE> "Now, when he had been condemned to the bea&s;ts, and in the heat of his &s;uffering had heard the roaring of the lions, he &s;aid, <HI>I am the corn of Chri&s;t, I am ground with the teeth of bea&s;ts, that I may be found pure bread.</HI> And "the acts of Ignatius's martyrdom," both the Greek and Latin acts, exhibit the &s;ame account with Jerom; and &s;o do Simeon the Metaphra&s;t, and the Roman breviary. Epi&s;copalians will not deny, that
<PB N="232" REF="012009_0241_0F8941C32C14E1B0">
the&s;e words were uttered by Ignatius, in the time of his &s;uffering. What diffi|culty can there then be in &s;uppo&s;ing, that Irenaeus &s;hould make mention of them, as a known, memorable SAYING of his? And why &s;hould not this be rather &s;up|po&s;ed, than that he &s;hould take them from that "epi&s;tle" which is attributed to him as its author? E&s;pecially, as there are &s;uch notorious circum&s;tances, all con&s;piring to encourage the thought, that he never &s;aw it.</P>
<P>BUT if we &s;hould allow this te&s;timony its utmo&s;t force, no more can be collect|ed from it, than that there was extant in the days of Irenaeus one SEVENTH PART of tho&s;e epi&s;tles that now go under the name of Ignatius. For it is only the "epi&s;tle to the Romans," one of the &s;e|ven that are attributed to him, that is here referred to. And every one, at the fir&s;t view, mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, how weak a te&s;timony this is; and that if it be al|lowed, or di&s;allowed, it will neither much hurt, or benefit, the general credit of the&s;e "epi&s;tles." And what may be thought worthy of notice, this "epi&s;tle to the Romans," the only one, upon the
<PB N="233" REF="012009_0242_0F8941C3EB62FAB8">
large&s;t &s;uppo&s;ition, here referred to, is the only one, among all the "Ignatian epi&s;|tles," that is &s;ilent about the cau&s;e of Epi&s;copacy. Nothing, as I remember, is &s;aid here upon this head; not &s;o much as the name Bi&s;hop mentioned, unle&s;s once very tran&s;iently. So that this is the only "epi&s;tle," among the "&s;even," that is in&s;ignificant to the controver&s;y we are upon. And if it be received as quoted by Irenaeus, it will do the Pre&s;byterians no di&s;&s;ervice; neither, if it be rejected as unknown to him, will it do the Epi&s;co|palians any harm. It is perfectly a mat|ter of no importance, as to the pre&s;ent di&s;pute, what becomes of it, or is &s;aid about it.</P>
<P>AFTER Irenaeus, Origen, who flouri&s;h|ed in the third century, is recurred to. In his "prologue to the commentaries on canticles," he &s;ays, "We remember one to have &s;aid, Ignatius by name, con|cerning Chri&s;t, <HI>but my love is crucified</HI>: nor do I judge him worthy of reproof for this." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Meminimus aliquem dixi&s;&s;e, nomine Ignatium, de Chri&s;to, "meus autem amor crucifixus e&s;t": nec reprehen|di <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">um pro hoc dignum judico."</NOTE> The&s;e words occur in the
<PB N="234" REF="012009_0243_0F8941C4ABF82E08">
"Ignatian epi&s;tle to the Romans," &s;ection vii. This &s;ame Origen, in his "&s;ixth homily on Luke," &s;peaks thus, "I have found it elegantly wrote in the epi&s;tle of a certain martyr, Ignatius I mean, Bi&s;hop of Antioch, the &s;econd after Peter, who fought with bea&s;ts in the per&s;ecution at Rome, <HI>the virginity of Mary was kept &s;ecret from the prince of this world.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"E<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">eganter in cujusdam martyris epi&s;tola &s;criptum reperi, Ignatium dico, Epi&s;copum Antiochiae, po&s;t Petrum &s;ecundum, qui in per&s;ecutione Romae pugnavit ad be&s;tias, "principem &s;aeculi hujus latuit Virginitas Mariae."</NOTE> The&s;e words we have in the "Ignatian epi&s;tle to the Ephe|&s;ians," &s;ect. xix.</P>
<P>TO the&s;e te&s;timonies from Origen, it mu&s;t be &s;aid, that they lie under the un|happine&s;s of being as exceptionable, as well as tho&s;e we have already con&s;idered. As to the fir&s;t of them, it is taken from a piece that is thought, by many of the mo&s;t learned writers, not to be Origen's, (who was a Pre&s;byter of the Greek church) but the work of &s;ome Latin author: or, &s;hould it be &s;uppo&s;ed to be his, we have it only in the tran&s;lation of Ruffin, who has taken &s;uch a &s;hameful liberty in all his tran&s;lations of Origen, to add, alter,
<PB N="235" REF="012009_0244_0F8941C5A64950B8">
and dimini&s;h, that there is no knowing what is his own, and what Origen's: and this is &s;o generally acknowledged, and lamented, by the learned, that a word need not be &s;aid in proof of it. It is, I &s;uppo&s;e, for this, or the foregoing rea|&s;on, or both, that tho&s;e celebrated anti|quaries, U&s;her, and Vo&s;&s;ius, do neither of them make u&s;e of this Origenical te&s;timony, in the evidence they ex|hibit in favor of the "epi&s;tles of Ignati|us"; as may be &s;een in their "prefaces" to their editions of the&s;e "epi&s;tles," in Le' Clerc's edition of Cotelerius's "apo&s;toli|cal Fathers." They were certainly well acquainted with it; and if they had thought it of any &s;ignificancy, they would have in&s;i&s;ted on it.&mdash;As for the other te&s;timony, taken from the "homily on Luke," this al&s;o is &s;u&s;pected to be the work, not of Origen, but of &s;ome Latin writer: or otherwi&s;e, it is extant only in Latin; and if it was tran&s;lated from the Greek by Jerom, as is pretended, there is no knowing what is Origen's. Du-pin &s;ays, "the ver&s;ions of Jerom are not more exact than Ruffin's: and Ruf|fin complains of the liberty Jerom took in his tran&s;lations, as Jerom complains of
<PB N="236" REF="012009_0245_0F8941C74D25A190">
Ruffin." And, &s;urely, no great credit ought to be given to meer tran&s;lations, which are known to have been done with an unbounded licence: and as this is the ca&s;e here, the&s;e te&s;timonies, brought to view, in evidence that Ignatius wrote "epi&s;tles," are of little weight, and will be e&s;teemed &s;o by impartial judges.</P>
<P>IT would be an omi&s;&s;ion if I did not add, it is a &s;hrewd circum&s;tance, in fa|vor of Origen's having never made men|tion of the "Ignatian epi&s;tles," that Eu&s;ebius takes not the lea&s;t notice of it. No one was a greater admirer, and rea|der, of Origen's works than Eu&s;ebius; nor was there an ancient Father more thoroughly ver&s;ed in them. It cannot therefore be accounted for, if Origin had, in the above &s;pecified places, commemo|rated Ignatius, that he &s;hould be totally &s;ilent about it. It is much more natu|ral to think, they are not the words of Origen, but of &s;ome interpolator, or fal&s;e interpreter.</P>
<P>WE have now con&s;idered the whole evidence, in proof that Ignatius wrote &s;uch "epi&s;tles" as go under his name,
<PB N="237" REF="012009_0246_0F8941C7AC633090">
until we come into the fourth century. And, I doubt not, that has been offered, which, to every unbia&s;&s;ed mind, will appear &s;ufficient to induce a &s;u&s;picion, le&s;t the venerable Ignatius &s;hould have been per&s;onated by &s;ome bold impo&s;tor. Mo&s;t certainly, the evidence, in &s;upport of his being the real author of the&s;e "epi&s;tles," falls va&s;tly &s;hort of what might rea&s;onably have been expected. There are, in all, but three writers, for the full &s;pace of two hundred years, that are produced as witne&s;&s;es, and the evidence they give is &s;o clogged with difficulties, as to occa&s;ion great doubt and he&s;i|tation. And, in truth, con&s;idering the character of Ignatius, his nearne&s;s to the Apo&s;tles, the extraordinary circum&s;tan|ces of his death, the uncommon occa|&s;ion of his writing the&s;e "epi&s;tles" (if they are truly his): con&s;idering, I &s;ay, the&s;e things, I may venture to appeal to the common &s;en&s;e of mankind, whether it is not a&s;toni&s;hing, that &s;uch epi&s;tles, of &s;uch a man, &s;hould be pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;uch &s;ilence for two hundred years toge|ther; no one writer making mention of them, unle&s;s in &s;uch a manner, and un|der &s;uch marks of &s;u&s;picion, as to leave
<PB N="238" REF="012009_0247_0F8941C86F1E58F0">
the mind in a &s;tate of uncertainty, to &s;ay the lea&s;t? I will not affirm, notwith|&s;tanding all that has been offered, that Ignatius wrote none of the "epi&s;tles" he is &s;aid to have wrote, though, to me, it appears highly improbable that he ever did.</P>
<P>I SHOULD now have gone on to &s;how, that the "Ignatian epi&s;tles" are, if not &s;purious, yet &s;o intermixed with corrup|tion, as to be unfit to be recurred to in the pre&s;ent controver&s;y. But previous to this, I &s;hall take notice of a difficulty that is urged, upon the &s;uppo&s;ition Igna|tius is not allowed to have wrote the&s;e "epi&s;tles" that are a&s;cribed to him, and &s;aid to be his.</P>
<P>IT is this, that Eu&s;ebius certainly thought, "the&s;e epi&s;tles" were wrote by Ignatius him&s;elf. And as he was a per|&s;on well capable of judging in this mat|ter, much better than we who live at &s;o great a di&s;tance from the times of Igna|tius, it is &s;aid to be a very bold thing now to plead, that "the&s;e epi&s;tles" are &s;purious.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="012009_0248_0F8941C92D4B0820">TO this the reply is, Eu&s;ebius was un|doubtedly a per&s;on of great learning, &s;ome think, the mo&s;t learned among all the chri&s;tian Greek Fathers. And we are ex|ceedingly beholden to him for many va|luable fragments of the works of many valuable primitive authors, which have long &s;ince peri&s;hed by the injury of time; as al&s;o for a great variety of know|ledge, relative to the Chri&s;tian hi&s;tory, we mu&s;t otherwi&s;e have been de&s;titute of. But this notwith&s;tanding, we are not obliged to call him <HI>Ma&s;ter,</HI> and, at all adventures, to take every thing for truth ju&s;t as he has delivered it. For, after all his learning, and whatever good qua|lities he might be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, he was a man "&s;ubject to like infirmities" with others; and there are too many in&s;tan|ces, in his writings, of carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, want of due attention, and a more thorough examination, not to &s;ay any thing wor&s;e. And he is, on all &s;ides, frequently charg|ed with &s;lips and mi&s;takes, and &s;ome that are very gro&s;s. The great Scaliger &s;ays of him, "No one has contributed more to the Chri&s;tian hi&s;tory, and no one is guilty of more mi&s;takes." Of the &s;ame mind was the learned Du-pin, though he
<PB N="240" REF="012009_0249_0F8941C9ED46D5E8">
expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf in &s;ofter terms. For, having &s;aid what he judged proper in com|mendation of his "eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory," he adds, "it mu&s;t neverthele&s;s be ac|knowledged, it is not altogether &s;o perfect as were to be wi&s;hed: for it is not written &s;moothly, neither is it always exact." And in his note here, he reckons up, at lea&s;t, half a &s;core of faults, which, &s;ays he, "are contrary both to the truth of hi&s;tory, and chronology." Nor do any of the noted antiquaries, either Prote&s;tant or Romi&s;h, Epi&s;copal or Pre&s;byterian, think them&s;elves obliged &s;acredly to ad|here to him; but do all, in their turns, take liberty to differ from him, and, as they imagine, upon ju&s;t grounds.</P>
<P>BUT what is more particularly perti|nent to what we are upon, Eu&s;ebius too credulou&s;ly &s;uffered him&s;elf to be &s;ome|times betrayed into the belief of that, which, if he had examined with more care, caution, and &s;u&s;picion, he would readily have rejected. There are in&s;tances of this to be met with in his valuable hi&s;to|ry. One I &s;hall here mention, as being full to the point under con&s;ideration. In the la&s;t chapter but one of the fir&s;t book
<PB N="241" REF="012009_0250_0F8941CAAD4E8A90">
of this hi&s;tory, we have a mo&s;t formal ac|count of "Agbarus's letter, King of Ede&s;|&s;a, to our Savior Je&s;us Chri&s;t, &s;ent to him at Jeru&s;alem by Ananias his foot|man;" and our "Savior's letter to King Agbarus in an&s;wer to it." And, in the following chapter, both the&s;e letters are in&s;erted at large, Eu&s;ebius having tran&s;|lated them out of the Syriac language, in which they were wrote, as he found the copies of them in the archieves of Ede&s;|&s;a. And the&s;e epi&s;tles, which he thus publi&s;hed to the world, he as verily be|lieved were wrote, one of them by our Savior, and the other by King Agbarus, as he did, that the epi&s;tles he mentions under the name of Ignatius were wrote by him. What regard now do the learn|ed world pay to Eu&s;ebius's judgment, with re&s;pect to the&s;e letters? Do they hold them&s;elves bound to receive them as "the epi&s;tles of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and King Agba|rus," becau&s;e Eu&s;ebius was too ha&s;tily led into this opinion of them? No; but, notwith&s;tanding the learning, the judg|ment, the integrity of Eu&s;ebius, and his nearne&s;s to the primitive times, they are &s;o free with him as to think, he was credulous in e&s;teeming "the&s;e letters"
<PB N="242" REF="012009_0251_0F8941CB6D4591B0">
genuine; and that he did it without &s;uf|ficient caution and enquiry. Even Arch-Bi&s;hop Wake has very plainly &s;ignified this to have been his opinion. Says he, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Apo&s;tol. Fathers" p. 93.</NOTE>
<Q>Natalis Alexander delivers this con|clu&s;ion; the "epi&s;tle of Agbarus" to our Savior, and "his an&s;wer" to it, are &s;uppo&s;ititious, and apocryphal: and, at large, an&s;wers all that is u&s;ually urged in favor of them. And Du|pin, after him, yet more &s;olidly con|vinces of &s;uch manife&s;t errors, as may &s;erve to &s;atisfy all con&s;idering per&s;ons, that Eu&s;ebius and Ephraaem were too ea&s;y of belief in this particular; and did not &s;ufficiently examine into it, when they delivered that as a certain truth, which, from &s;everal circum|&s;tances, appears to have been evidently otherwi&s;e.</Q>
Now, from this in&s;tance, produced from Eu&s;ebius, the arguing is both natural and forcible. If he might be mi&s;taken in his opinion about "the&s;e letters," he might al&s;o be mi&s;taken in his opinion about the "Ignatian epi&s;tles." If he was too credulou&s;ly betrayed into a belief of the genuinene&s;s of "the&s;e
<PB N="243" REF="012009_0252_0F8941CC2C184CB0">
letters," which are mo&s;t palpably &s;purious, he might al&s;o too credulou&s;ly come into the belief of the genuinene&s;s of the "epi&s;|tles of Ignatius." If, with re&s;pect to "the&s;e letters," he was too inattentive, not &s;ufficiently &s;u&s;picious, too thought|le&s;s of being impo&s;ed upon by religious fraud, this might al&s;o have been the ca&s;e with re&s;pect to the "epi&s;tles" in di&s;pute. Nor if the learned world do, without any difficulty, reject "the&s;e letters" as &s;puri|ous, in contradiction to the judgment of Eu&s;ebius, ought it to be objected as a difficulty in the way of rejecting "Ig|natius's epi&s;tles," that herein Eu&s;ebius's judgment is oppo&s;ed: nor can this be urged as a difficulty without evident par|tiality. For, in the in&s;tance we have mentioned, no difficulty is pretended; but the whole body of writers, both Ro|mi&s;h and Prote&s;tant (a few only excepted) reject "the&s;e letters" as a fraudulent im|po&s;ition upon the world, without making any compliment to the great Eu&s;ebius for their oppo&s;ition to him in this matter.</P>
<P>BUT, be&s;ides what has been offered, Eu&s;ebius has, in the ca&s;e before us, re|pre&s;ented the evidence upon which he
<PB N="244" REF="012009_0253_0F8941CCED396098">
received the&s;e "epi&s;tles;" which, if de|ficient, we have plainly no rea&s;on to be moved by his judgment: and that it really is &s;o we before proved, when the te&s;timonies of Polycarp and Irenaeus were con&s;idered, the two only ones he has men|tioned in &s;upport of the credit of "the&s;e epi&s;tles." It may, perhaps, be thought &s;trange, that Eu&s;ebius &s;hould judge, from the te&s;timonies of Polycarp and Irenaeus, that Ignatius wrote "the&s;e epi&s;tles," if what they &s;ay, be, as we have already endeavored to evince, in&s;ufficient for the purpo&s;e. But, why might not Eu&s;ebius make more of the&s;e te&s;timonies than they really contained, and argue too much from them, as others have done &s;ince? And that he has &s;o done (whether "the&s;e epi&s;tles" are true or fal&s;e) is too evident to be called in que&s;tion; as appears from what has been before offered upon this head. For, let it be ob&s;erved, he intro|duces Irenaeus &s;peaking upon the matter after this manner, "and Irenaeus remem|bered his EPISTLES, writing thus, <HI>be|cau&s;e I am the wheat of God.</HI>"&mdash;The&s;e words are to be found no where in the writings of Ignatius, but in the "epi&s;tle to the Romans:" nor does Irenaeus any|where
<PB N="245" REF="012009_0254_0F8941CDAD40F600">
where el&s;e mention any writing of Igna|tius, or refer to any pa&s;&s;age in his &s;uppo|&s;ed works. So that the utmo&s;t that can be collected, in point of argument, from the&s;e words is, that "the epi&s;tle to the Romans" was commemorated by Ire|naeus. But the conclu&s;ion, which Eu&s;e|bius draws, re&s;pects the "epi&s;tles in ge|neral;" which is certainly an in&s;tance of inattention to the ju&s;t import of the words he argues from. He goes on, "and Polycarp maketh mention hereof, in his epi&s;tle to the Philippians, writing thus,&mdash;<HI>the epi&s;tle of Ignatius which he &s;ent to us, and as many other epi&s;tles.</HI>"&mdash;It is far from being evident, as has been abun|dantly proved already, that Polycarp here mentions any more than TWO EPISTLES of Ignatius; and yet, the words are brought in evidence of the EPISTLES WITHOUT LIMITATION; which is ano|ther in&s;tance of a cur&s;ory con&s;ideration only of this pa&s;&s;age. Had he been &s;uf|ficiently cautious, he might have &s;een rea|&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, whether this te&s;timony was at all Polycarp's.&mdash;The true &s;tate of the ca&s;e &s;eems to have been this;&mdash;There were extant, in the days of Eu&s;ebius, "epi&s;tles under the name of Ignatius to

&s;everal famous churches;" and, meet|ing with a pa&s;&s;age in Polycarp's letter, that made mention of "epi&s;tles of Ig|natius," and another in Irenaeus, citing words that are to be found in ONE of "the&s;e epi&s;tles," he ha&s;tily concluded, without more ado, that Ignatius wrote ALL THE EPISTLES he had &s;een under his name: whereas, if he had thoroughly examined the matter, he would have found the&s;e te&s;timonies too weak to &s;upport the conclu&s;ion he makes from them; as they mo&s;t certainly are, whatever is the truth as touching "the&s;e epi&s;tles."</P>
<P>I SHALL only add, that Eu&s;ebius &s;eems not to have been without &s;ome bia&s;s up|on his mind, in favor of the "Ignatian epi&s;tles." For it is a plain ca&s;e, the &s;i|lence of the ancients, re&s;pecting particu|lar writings, is, with him, an argument much weakening the credit of them. The "&s;econd epi&s;tle of Clement" he e&s;teems, if not &s;uppo&s;ititious, at lea&s;t "le&s;s fa|mous, and le&s;s worthy of notice," be|cau&s;e "no te&s;timonies are alleged for it by the Elders." And the "dialogues of Peter and Apion" he looks upon as plainly &s;purious, for this, among other
<PB N="247" REF="012009_0256_0F8941CF2B7FC1E8">
rea&s;ons, "that none of the Elders have mentioned it." But, in the pre&s;ent in|&s;tance, though, as we have &s;een, there is a mo&s;t &s;urprizing &s;ilence in primitive an|tiquity about any writings of Ignatius, yet he takes no notice at all of it; but receives the "epi&s;tles" extant in his day, under the name of "this Father," with|out the lea&s;t he&s;itation, and by the lump too. And if Mr. Whi&s;ton's rea&s;oning may be thought valid, a good account may be given of this matter. According to him, the "epi&s;tles of Ignatius," ex|tant in the days of Eu&s;ebius, were the LARGER ONES, that is, the&s;e epi&s;tles as we have them in the editions before tho&s;e of U&s;her and Vo&s;&s;ius. As to the SHOR|TER EPISTLES," that is, tho&s;e we have in the editions of the&s;e learned antiqua|ries, he &s;peaks of them as the LARGER EPISTLES arbitrarily mangled and cur|tailed. And his arguments, upon this head, appear to me, I freely confe&s;s, to be exceeding weighty: nor do I think, they ever have been, or can be, fully an|&s;wered. And &s;hould this be the truth, there is no great difficulty in &s;uppo&s;ing, that Eu&s;ebius might be inclined to think as well of them as might be. For, as he
<PB N="248" REF="012009_0257_0F8941D00109CAF8">
and Whi&s;ton were nearly of the &s;ame &s;entiments, relative to an important point of Chri&s;tian doctrine, it was but natural for him to be well affected to "the&s;e epi&s;tles," which are well known to look with a favorable eye on this di&s;tingui&s;h|ing tenet of their's. So that, upon the whole, it is but rea&s;onable we &s;hould be left fairly to judge of the evidence in fa|vor, or di&s;-favor, of "the&s;e epi&s;tles," without being at all &s;wayed by the judgment of Eu&s;ebius: nor ought it to be looked upon as an objection of any weight again&s;t our rejecting them, that that learned au|thor thought them genuine; provided we have good rea&s;on &s;o to do.</P>
<P>I WILL not take upon me to &s;ay, that Ignatius did not write "epi&s;tles" that were &s;een by Eu&s;ebius; but thus much I will venture to &s;ay, that it is highly pro|bable, mo&s;t unprejudiced per&s;ons, in con|&s;equence of what has been offered, will be &s;trongly inclined to que&s;tion, whether they were &s;o certainly HIS, as to leave no rea&s;onable room for doubt in the ca&s;e.&mdash; But I mu&s;t now go on,</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="012009_0258_0F8941D1A48895B8">TO offer what may be thought nece&s;|&s;ary to &s;how, that "the&s;e epi&s;tles," if not &s;purious, have yet been corrupted to a de|degree that unfits them to be appealed to, as exhibiting the real mind of Ignatius; e&s;pecially with re&s;pect to Epi&s;copacy, the point now under debate.</P>
<P>WHAT I here propo&s;e to con&s;ider, meerly as interlarded corruption, is made u&s;e of by Daille, La'roque, and other learned writers, to prove, from the IN|TERNAL CONTENTS of "the&s;e epi&s;tles" them&s;elves, that they were not wrote by Ignatius, but by &s;ome later hand. And it mu&s;t be acknowledged, the EXTERNAL EVIDENCE in proof, that Ignatius did not write "the&s;e epi&s;tles," if con&s;idered in connection with this INTERNAL EVI|DENCE, will give great additional force to the argument, and leave &s;carce any room for doubt in the ca&s;e.&mdash;But I chu&s;e to give the Epi&s;copalians all the advantage they can de&s;ire; and &s;hall therefore here argue upon the &s;uppo&s;ition, that Igna|tius really wrote "epi&s;tles" that were extant in the days of Eu&s;ebius: but, even upon this &s;uppo&s;ition, we claim to be excu&s;ed from placing any manner of

dependance upon what they &s;ay, e&s;peci|ally upon the head of Epi&s;copacy; and for this very good rea&s;on, becau&s;e we af|firm, and &s;hall prove, that they are &s;o mingled with corruption, as not to con|vey the mind of the truly venerable Ig|natius.</P>
<P>SOME, perhaps, may think it owing to prejudice, when it is &s;o much as in&s;i|nuated, as if there were any corrupt mix|tures in &s;uch eminently valuable "epi&s;|tles" as tho&s;e of Ignatius. But it ought to be known, and remembered, that Ig|natius has been impudently and frau|dulently dealt with, no le&s;s than EIGHT of the fifteen epi&s;tles, that bear his name, being FORGERIES, and owned to be &s;o: be&s;ides which, it is true likewi&s;e, and ac|knowledged as the truth, even by Bi&s;hop Pear&s;on him&s;elf, the great advocate for Ignatius, that the other "&s;even epi&s;|tles," in all the editions of them, before U&s;her and Vo&s;&s;ius, were &s;o CORRUPTED by &s;ome knavi&s;h interpolator or other, as that they ought not to be depended on as exhibiting the real mind of the true Ignatius. It is not argued from hence, that the U&s;herian and Vo&s;&s;ian editions
<PB N="251" REF="012009_0260_0F8941D2EC0B0258">
mu&s;t needs be corrupted al&s;o; but thus much is obviou&s;ly, and certainly dedu|cible herefrom, that they MAY be &s;o; that to &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch a thing is no indica|tion of prejudice again&s;t them, as it is no more than has been actually done, with re&s;pect to the&s;e very "epi&s;tles," in for|mer editions.</P>
<P>MUCH might ea&s;ily be offered in &s;up|port of the affirmation, that the "epi&s;tles of Ignatius," in their late&s;t, be&s;t, and mo&s;t purged editions, are too much mix|ed with interpolated corruption to be de|pended on, as letting us into his true and real &s;entiments. I might particularly con&s;ider the "in&s;criptions" to the&s;e epi&s;|tles; all which carry with them this &s;hrewd mark of time, LATER than the days of Ignatius, their &s;peaking of him in the &s;tile of THEOPHOROS, an epithet never applied to him, until ages after his death.&mdash;I might take notice of the &s;to|ry of Ignatius's being "carried in bonds, from Syria to Rome, to be thrown to wild bea&s;ts," on the truth of which his epi&s;|tles intirely depend; and yet, the &s;tory is in it&s;elf a very &s;trange and unaccoun|table one, and &s;o e&s;teemed by many of

the mo&s;t learned writers.&mdash;I might in&s;i&s;t upon what is &s;aid of the "<HI>word's</HI> pro|ceeding from <HI>Sig&ecirc;,</HI>" a term of art in the <HI>Valentinian</HI> theology, not known to be u&s;ed as &s;uch, until after the departure of Ignatius out of our world.&mdash;In a word, I might bring to view a great number of pa&s;&s;ages, which it would be a di&s;honor to Ignatius to a&s;cribe to him, they are either &s;o weak, or ab&s;urd, or ridiculous, or in|con&s;i&s;tent with what he has el&s;ewhere &s;aid, and &s;ometimes in the &s;ame epi&s;tle.&mdash; But it would be too great, as well as need|le&s;s, a tryal of the reader's patience to con&s;ider &s;o many articles. I &s;hall there|fore pa&s;s them over, and wholly confine my&s;elf to what, more e&s;pecially, relates to the pre&s;ent controver&s;y, the things that are &s;aid concerning the OFFICERS OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH. And I the rather chu&s;e to enlarge upon this head, as it is enlarged upon in ALL the "Ignatian epi&s;tles" (the epi&s;tle to the Romans on|ly excepted,) and in a MANNER evidently &s;hewing, if the&s;e "epi&s;tles" are not &s;pu|rious, that they have been tampered with, and ba&s;ely corrupted by &s;ome over-heat|ed zealot for eccle&s;ia&s;tical dignity, and power, &s;o as to be unfitted to hand to us
<PB N="253" REF="012009_0262_0F8941D46D4AE8E0">
the true &s;entiments of the real Ignatius. And here it may be offered as follows.</P>
<P>CONSIDERING the circum&s;tances of Ignatius, when he is &s;aid to have wrote the&s;e epi&s;tles;&mdash;his being a pri&s;oner of death, and on his journey to Rome to &s;uffer martyrdom, it is not at all proba|ble, he &s;hould have his heart &s;o &s;et on exalting the Clergy, as, in all his epi&s;tles, to write, as if the main thing &s;uitable to be told the churches, was, that they had "worthy and God-becoming Bi&s;hops and Pre&s;byters, whom they ought to honor, and obey, even as Je&s;us Chri&s;t honored and obeyed the Father." There is evi|dently more, much more, &s;aid, in the&s;e epi&s;tles, upon the rights of the Clergy, and the &s;ubjection that was due to them, than upon any other &s;ubject, though of fundamental importance.&mdash;Does not this appear &s;trange? It would certainly do &s;o in any epi&s;tles wrote, at pre&s;ent, un|der like circum&s;tances. And what makes the matter &s;till more extraordinary, the &s;ame words and phra&s;es, upon the &s;ame beloved &s;ubject, not only come over in every epi&s;tle, &s;ave one; but in mo&s;t of them, they are needle&s;&s;ly repeated; and,
<PB N="254" REF="012009_0263_0F8941D52D4AC1D0">
in &s;ome of them, their repetition over and over again is quite ful&s;ome. To this it is &s;aid by Epi&s;copalians,</P>
<P>THAT here&s;ies now began to be broa|ched, and to infect the minds of many; and therefore, as the mo&s;t proper expe|dient that could, at that time, be thought on, to pre&s;erve the churches pure, Ig|natius exhorts them, and with pre&s;&s;ing earne&s;tne&s;s, to an adherence to the Cler|gy, union with, and &s;ubjection to, their Bi&s;hops and Pre&s;byters. And his &s;o zealou&s;ly, and frequently, in&s;i&s;ting upon this head, is made even a &s;ign of his &s;oul's flaming with love to the churches; di&s;co|vered in ardent de&s;ires that they might flouri&s;h in peace, truth, and holine&s;s, af|ter he had been devoured by wild bea&s;ts. In an&s;wer whereto,</P>
<P>I WOULD not go about to detract, in the lea&s;t, from the piety of Ignatius, his concern for the purity of the churches, and de&s;ire to pre&s;erve them from here&s;y: but, at the &s;ame time, cannot but think it very wonderful, if "&s;ubjection to church-governors" an implicit adher|ence to the "Bi&s;hop and his Clergy,"
<PB N="255" REF="012009_0264_0F8941D5ED2CAE98">
&s;uch a notable expedient, &s;o &s;ure and ef|fectual an one, to guard again&s;t here&s;y, that none of the Fathers contemporary with Ignatius &s;hould be &s;o happy as to hit upon it. It was as good an expedi|ent to cure divi&s;ions, as to &s;ecure from here&s;y; and yet, Clement of Rome makes no mention at all of it to the church of Corinth, when he wrote to them as rent with &s;trife and &s;ci&s;m. And it is ob&s;erva|ble, Polycarp, who wrote ju&s;t after Igna|tius, and with his "epi&s;tles" in keeping (as is pretended), among other things, cautions the church at Philippi again&s;t the ERRORS that then prevailed among many. But how does he pre&s;s the ex|hortation? Why, not a word does he li&s;p about their adhering to <HI>their Bi&s;hop, with the re&s;t of the Clergy,</HI> the great ar|gument here &s;aid to be u&s;ed by Ignatius: but he be&s;peaks them in the&s;e words, "The&s;e things, <HI>my brethren,</HI> I took not the liberty of my&s;elf to write unto you.&mdash;For neither I, nor any other &s;uch as I am, come up to the wi&s;|dom of the ble&s;&s;ed and renowned Paul, who, being him&s;elf in per&s;on with tho&s;e that then lived, did, with exactne&s;s and &s;oundne&s;s, teach the word of truth; and
<PB N="256" REF="012009_0265_0F8941D6B0EC6DE8">
being gone from you wrote an epi&s;tle to you, into which if you look, you will be able to edify your&s;elves in the faith that hath been delivered to you, which is the mother of us all."&mdash;And a little onwards, "Wherefore, leaving the vanity of many, and their fal&s;e doctrines, let us return to the word that was delivered to us from the beginning." If Ignatius had been as particular, and full, in recommending an adherence to the SCRIPTURE, an obe|dience to the APOSTOLIC WRITINGS, as he is in urging an adherence to the CLER|GY, and SUBJECTION TO THEM, it might, po&s;&s;ibly, have been as good a guard again&s;t "infection by here&s;y." He does, indeed, &s;ometimes exhorts tho&s;e he writes to, "to &s;tudy to be confirmed in the doctrine of our Lord, and his Apo&s;tles;" but where he ONCE advi&s;es to this, I will venture to &s;ay, he TEN TIMES pre&s;&s;es a regard to the CLERGY; and this he does in very unguarded language, without ever making the &s;uppo&s;ition, that they al&s;o might be corrupted with error; and, in this ca&s;e, cautioning the churches again&s;t being led a&s;ide by their governors: which is making much more of the Clergy, than the Apo&s;tles ever made of them&s;elves.&mdash;
<PB N="257" REF="012009_0266_0F8941D76B3D61B8">
But I &s;hall not enlarge here, having men|tioned what has been offered as a &s;mall circum&s;tance only, in compari&s;on with what I have yet to &s;ay. To go on there|fore,</P>
<P>IT is of more weighty con&s;ideration, that the officers of the chri&s;tian church are commonly &s;poken of, in "the&s;e epi&s;tles," in language not at all con&s;onant to the age in which the true Ignatius lived, nor indeed in the lea&s;t worthy of &s;o fa|mous and primitive a Father and martyr. What other thought can rea&s;onably be entertained of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, in which Bi&s;hops are repre&s;ented as "pre&s;iding in the place of God:" in which they are compared to "God the Father, to Je&s;us Chri&s;t the Son of the Father:" in which the churches are taught it to be their duty "to receive them as the Lord, to reverence them as Je&s;us Chri&s;t;" yea&punc; "to follow them as Chri&s;t does the Fa|ther:" in which they are commanded "&s;o to obey and &s;ubject them&s;elves to the Bi&s;hop as to do nothing without him, however rea&s;onable it might appear to them:" in which they are exhorted to be "&s;o one with the Bi&s;hop, as Chri&s;t is
<PB N="258" REF="012009_0267_0F8941D914354F30">
one with the Father;" and "&s;o to do nothing without him, as Chri&s;t did no|thing without the Father:" in which &s;o great account is made of obedience and &s;ubjection to the Bi&s;hop, that they that "do any thing without him" are e&s;teem|ed "doing the devil a &s;ervice;" and tho&s;e that remain with him" are, upon this ac|count only, thought worthy of the cha|racter of "belonging to Chri&s;t;" and are repre&s;ented as "walking not as men, but according to Chri&s;t:" yea, in which obedience to the officers of the church is &s;o highly e&s;timated by the writer, or in|terpolator, of "the&s;e epi&s;tles," that he even "pawns his &s;oul for tho&s;e that obey the Bi&s;hop, Pre&s;byters, and Deacons; and de&s;ires his portion in God may be with &s;uch."</P>
<P>THESE, and like expre&s;&s;ions, to be met with in "the&s;e epi&s;tles," are not ea&s;ily to be accounted for, upon the &s;uppo&s;ition that they have not been interlaced with corruption. In their literal and mo&s;t obvious &s;en&s;e, they are unworthy of any pious writer; much more of &s;o venera|ble a Father, and illu&s;trious a martyr, as Ignatius: nor can it be di&s;owned, that,
<PB N="259" REF="012009_0268_0F8941D9ABFB1FF0">
in this &s;en&s;e, they exalt the Clergy be|yond all rea&s;onable bounds, claiming for them the mo&s;t ab&s;olutely blind obedi|ence: and &s;hould we qualify their &s;en&s;e, to the utmo&s;t extent they are capable of, they carry the dignity and power of Bi|&s;hops and Pre&s;byters, and the &s;ubjection due to them, not only far above their de&s;erts, but &s;o as to di&s;cover the TRUE SPIRIT of AFTER-TIMES, and not that in which Ignatius is known to have lived.</P>
<P>IT may, with the exacte&s;t truth, be affir|med, that none of the writers, in the days of Ignatius, or near the age in which he flouri&s;hed, do bear the lea&s;t likene&s;s to him in his mode of &s;peaking, relative to the officers of the church. The&s;e unite, as one, in language becoming the &s;impli|city of the go&s;pel, and the purity and hu|mility of tho&s;e primitive times: where|as, the general &s;train of "Ignatus's epi&s;|tles" is evidently adapted, I may &s;ay, pur|po&s;ely contrived, to aggrandi&s;e the Clergy, and be&s;peak for them the highe&s;t rever|ence, honor, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. How can this be accounted for, without the &s;up|po&s;ition of &s;ome medling interpolator?

Why, otherwi&s;e, &s;hould there be &s;uch a &s;ignal difference between his manner of writing, and that of all the ancients in his day, and for a long time after his life had come to a period here on earth?</P>
<P>THE difference of &s;tile, in different writers, will not, as is pleaded here, ac|count for this. The &s;tile of Hermas wide|ly differs fromt hat of Clement, as Cle|ment's does. from that of Polycarp, and Polycarp's from that of Ju&s;tin Martyr, and Irenaeus; and yet, they all lead us to think much the &s;ame thing about the Clergy; and this, with all de&s;irable clear|ne&s;s and certainty, though they &s;everally expre&s;s them&s;elves in a manner peculiar each one to him&s;elf. And why might not Ignatius have wrote in his own &s;tile, and yet have concurred with his contem|poraries, in a like account of the officers of the church? It ought, mo&s;t certainly, to be a&s;cribed, not to meer difference in &s;tile, but to &s;ome other cau&s;e, that he &s;o &s;trangely differs from them. And what cau&s;e can this be, but the interlading hand of &s;ome zealot for clerical power and honor?</P>

The APPROPRIATION of the&s;e terms is not accidental, but de&s;igned; and it runs through all the copies of the&s;e epi&s;tles, the U&s;herian and Vo&s;&s;ian, as well as tho&s;e that were extant before them: is, in no ca&s;e, at no time, upon no occa|&s;ion, departed from.</P>
<P>WHAT agreement, now, is there be|tween the &s;uppo&s;ed Ignatius, and his con|temporaries, upon this head? Do they u&s;e the words, Bi&s;hop and Pre&s;byter, as he does, in an appropriated fixed &s;en&s;e? It cannot, with any face of truth, be af|firmed, that they do. Far from this, they differ as much from him, in their u&s;e of the&s;e terms, as they do from any of the writers of the third, or fourth centuries. There is indeed no writer, either before
<PB N="265" REF="012009_0274_0F8941DE2D29F360">
Ignatius, or at the time when he wrote, or even afterwards for more than an hun|dred years, that u&s;es the&s;e words as he does, in a &s;en&s;e &s;o certainly, and invaria|bly, fixed and appropriated. The re|der is de&s;ired to compare the pretended Ignatius's <HI>mode of diction,</HI> upon this point, with <HI>that</HI> which is held out to view, in the pre&s;ent volume, from all the writers until towards the clo&s;e of the &s;econd cen|tury; and he may then, from ocular in|&s;pection, be convinced, that he greatly differs fromt hem all; and eminently in this re&s;pect, that he invariably u&s;es the words, Bi&s;hop and Pre&s;byter, in the AP|PROPRIATED &s;en&s;e; while they u&s;e them promi&s;cuou&s;ly, &s;ometimes calling Bi&s;hops, Pre&s;byters; and &s;ometimes Pre&s;byters, Bi&s;hops: meaning by both terms one and the &s;ame order of officers in the church. He will evidently &s;ee, in "Hermas's pa&s;|tor," that the word, Bi&s;hops, is explained to &s;ignify, "tho&s;e that pre&s;ide in the church;" and that tho&s;e who pre&s;ide in the church are "the Pre&s;byters of it." He will at once perceive, in "Clement's epi&s;tle to the Corinthians," that the &s;ame officers who are called "Pre&s;byters," are directly &s;poken of as "ca&s;t out of their
<PB N="266" REF="012009_0275_0F8941DEEBC9BF50">
Epi&s;copacy." When he turns to Poly|carp, the &s;uppo&s;ed collector of the "Ig|natian epi&s;tles," and the next and near|e&s;t writer to him, &s;o far will he be from finding an analogy between "his epi&s;|tle," and the "epi&s;tles of Ignatius," that he no where &s;peaks of the Bi&s;hop of Philippi, or of any other church: nor does he &s;o much as mention the word, Bi&s;hop; which is really unaccountable, if it be re|membered, conformably to the &s;entiments of Epi&s;copalians, that Ignatius had very lately, and under the mo&s;t extraordinary circum&s;tances too, wrote "his epi&s;tles," and that Polycarp was particularly ac|quainted with them; yea, that he had wrote "one epi&s;tle to Polycarp" him&s;elf, and another to "his church at Smyrna," in one of which he "pawns his &s;oul for them that were obedient to the Bi|&s;hop, and the other Clergy;" and, in the other, makes the Bi&s;hop &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, that "no admini&s;tration could be valid with|out him, but whatever he &s;hould approve would be plea&s;ing to God." And he will be no more able to find in Ju&s;tin Martyr, or Irenaeus, an APPROPRIATED u&s;e of the terms, Bi&s;hop and Pre&s;byter, than in either of the foregoing writers.
<PB N="267" REF="012009_0276_0F8941DFAB411AD8">
Irenaeus, it is true, frequently u&s;es the&s;e terms, but in the PROMISCUOUS &s;en&s;e; as no one can be at a lo&s;s to perceive, who will be at the trouble of reading over the te&s;timonies, in this work, produced out of his writings: nor are the words, Bi|&s;hop and Pre&s;byter, u&s;ed as APPROPRI|ATED ones, until towards the clo&s;e of the &s;econd century; and, even then, the AP|PROPRIATION was not &s;teadily fixed. Clement of Alexandria, who chiefly flou|ri&s;hed in the latter end of the &s;econd cen|tury, and the beginning of the third, is the fir&s;t writer who u&s;es the mode of &s;peech, &s;o common, and invariable, with Ignatius, "Bi&s;hops, Pre&s;byters, and Dea|cons; and yet, &s;o long after the days of Ignatius, the di&s;tinct APPROPRIATION of the&s;e names was not certainly fixed. We mu&s;t go into the third century, I may rather &s;ay, beyond it, before the appropriation, after the manner of Ig|natius, is con&s;tant, &s;acred, and invari|able.</P>
<P>UPON which, the enquiry is highly per|tinent, how &s;hould Ignatius con&s;tantly, and forever, u&s;e the words, Bi&s;hop and Pre&s;byter, not in the &s;en&s;e in which they
<PB N="268" REF="012009_0277_0F8941E153771BC8">
were u&s;ed, in the age in which he wrote; but in the &s;en&s;e, in which they were u|&s;ed, in other ages, long after his death? This certainly looks &s;u&s;picious, and ought, in all rea&s;on, to put us upon our guard, le&s;t we &s;hould take &s;ome jugling impo&s;tor for the worthy, and primitive Ignatius. Words, we know, often vary in their &s;ig|nification; and &s;ometimes, when u&s;ed in this or that particular &s;en&s;e, are as &s;ure a mark of &s;uch a particular age, as the &s;pe|cial mode or fa&s;hion of garments. And this is plainly the ca&s;e here. Before the days of Ignatius, about the time of his living, and dying, and for many years after, the words, Bi&s;hop and Pre&s;byter, were not APPROPRIATED names, and as &s;uch applied to different per&s;ons; but were INDIFFERENTLY u&s;ed to point out either Bi&s;hops, or Pre&s;byters: whereas, towards the going out of this age, or rather the coming on of the next, they began to loo&s;e their PROMISCUOUS u&s;e, and to become APPROPRIATED terms, conveying the idea of different per&s;ons, who were commonly known, and di&s;tin|gui&s;hed, by the application of the&s;e now different names: though, it ought to be remembered, this appropriation was not
<PB N="269" REF="012009_0278_0F8941E1EE88B070">
&s;o SACRED and INVIOLABLE, as in the "epi&s;tles of Ignatius", till we have got much farther from the age in which he lived. And we are herefrom pre&s;ented with a criterion, by which we may de|termine, with all de&s;irable certainty, ei|ther that Ignatius did not write the "epi&s;tles" that go under his name, or that they have been &s;afely, and fraudu|lently, corrupted by &s;ome bigot for cleri|cal honor and power; in&s;omuch, that there is no knowing the real &s;entiments of the true Ignatius.</P>
<P>I HAVE now, with con&s;cious care and impartiality, endeavoured to exhibit the true &s;tate of the "epi&s;tles" called "Ig|natian;" leaving it with the reader to judge for him&s;elf, how far they may, with certainty, be depended on; more e&s;pecial|ly in the pre&s;ent debate. Po&s;&s;ibly, he may be di&s;po&s;ed to que&s;tion, whether Ignatius was at all the writer of the "epi&s;tles" that are a&s;cribed to him: or, &s;hould he be inclined to think he was, it is &s;carce &s;uppo&s;able, but he &s;hould be clearly &s;atisfied, that &s;ome fraudulent hand has made him write in a manner quite

di&s;&s;onant from the times in which he liv|ed; and to &s;uch a degree, as to unfit his "epi&s;tles" to be repaired to, with confi|dence, in the debate concerning epi&s;co|pacy.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS and REMARKS upon the TESTIMONIES from IGNATIUS.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH I have enlarged, in the fore|going pages, upon the rea&s;ons we have to think, that the "&s;even epi&s;tles" of Ig|natius are either SPURIOUS, or &s;o INTER|LARDED WITH AFTER ADDITIONS as not to be depended on; yet, I can truly &s;ay, I was not moved to this from an appre|hen&s;ion, that "the&s;e epi&s;tles," unle&s;s ta|ken out of the way, would be ruinous, or indeed at all hurtful, to the cau&s;e in the defence of which I am engaged. Epi&s;|copalians, I know, ever repair to them as their main &s;trength; and are ready to think, and &s;ay, that we are di&s;po&s;ed to &s;peak injuriou&s;ly of them, upon any
<PB N="290" REF="012009_0299_0F89422F2D018BA0">
pretences, however &s;lighty, becau&s;e they &s;peak &s;o clearly and fully again&s;t us. But they are herein greatly mi&s;taken. It is owing to the force of truth, and not to prejudice, or fear le&s;t our cau&s;e &s;hould &s;uffer, if tried by them, that we repre&s;ent them as under very &s;trong marks of &s;u&s;|picion. And to induce a belief of this, and, at the &s;ame time, to do ju&s;tice to our &s;ide of the di&s;pute, I &s;hall, in what fol|lows, &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e "epi&s;tles" to be GE|NUINE, as truly &s;o as the writings of Clement, or any other primitive Father; and, in this view of them, endeavor to &s;hew, that they furni&s;h much more evidence in favor of us, than of the Epi&s;|copalians; and that they may be ju&s;tly brought as witne&s;&s;es in defence of our cau&s;e, rather than their's.</P>
<P>IN order to &s;et this matter in a fair point of light, let it be remembered, the Bi&s;hops pleaded for by our antagoni&s;ts are DIOCESAN ones; and the POWERS they make ESSENTIAL to the epi&s;copal office, and exclude Pre&s;byters from, are tho&s;e of GOVERNMENT, ORDINATION, and CONFIRMATION. Let us now review the "Ignatian te&s;timonies," and &s;ee whether
<PB N="291" REF="012009_0300_0F89422FEC483A38">
they &s;peak of SUCH BISHOPS, or THESE POWERS that are &s;aid to be ESSENTIAL to their office, and characteri&s;tical of it.</P>
<P>I SHALL begin with &s;aying, that, upon the &s;tricte&s;t examination of all that is &s;aid in the "epi&s;tles of Ignatius," nothing can be found that will lead one into the idea of a DIOCESAN Bi&s;hop. It is as evident as it well can be, from the whole tenor of "the&s;e epi&s;tles," that the Ignatian Bi&s;hop was the pa&s;toral head of a SINGLE CONGREGATION, who u&s;ually met toge|ther in one place, and united in an atten|dance on the in&s;titutions of Chri&s;tianity. So much is to be met with upon this point, and in language &s;o full and ex|pre&s;s, that no rea&s;onable room is left for he&s;itation or doubt.</P>
<P>IGNATIUS "in&s;cribes" all the&s;e epi&s;|tles to SINGLE &s;ocieties of Chri&s;tians, in this and the other particular place. "To the church in Ephe&s;us," in "Magne&s;ia," in "Philadelphia," and &s;o on. And he applies &s;everally to the&s;e churches, as one would &s;peak to a &s;ingle congregation of Chri&s;tians, who&s;e cu&s;tom it was frequent|ly to a&s;&s;emble in one place, and join as
<PB N="292" REF="012009_0301_0F894230AC40B470">
one in wor&s;hipping God through Je&s;us Chri&s;t. And not only &s;o, but the directi|ons and exhortations he gives, both to the&s;e churches, and their Bi&s;hops, are &s;uch as make it morally certain, that he writes to &s;ingle congregations of Chri&s;tians, and not a number of them con&s;tituting one church. In&s;tances to this purpo&s;e might ea&s;ily be produced out of each of "the&s;e epi&s;tles." But, as &s;uch an enu|meration would be both needle&s;s, and te|dious, I &s;hall &s;elect only a few &s;triking &s;pecimens that mu&s;t be convincing to prejudice it&s;elf.</P>
<P>HE &s;ays to the church at Ephe&s;us, "If the prayer of one or two has &s;uch efficacy, how much more that of the Bi&s;hop, and the WHOLE CHURCH! HE that cometh not to the SAME PLACE <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The phra&s;e EPI TO AUTO, may be under&s;tood as re|ferring either to TIME, PLACE, or DESIGN, and is accordingly tran&s;lated, by the be&s;t critics, in all the&s;e &s;en|&s;es. It's propriety as meaning PLACE or TIME, ra|ther then DESIGN; and DESIGN rather than either of the former, can be determined only by the import of the &s;entence in which it is found, and the part it bears as connected with the di&s;cour&s;e. In this view of the phra&s;e, it cannot be better tran&s;lated here, than in the words of Arch-Bi&s;hop Wake, TO THE SAME PLACE. He was as clo&s;e a friend to the church of England as any man in his day, and would not have given this turn to the words, could he have pitched upon any other more favorable to the cau&s;e of Epi&s;copacy. The plain truth is, whether the phra&s;e is tran&s;lated here, or in the other places where it is u&s;ed in "Ignatius's epi&s;tles," TO THE SAME PLACE, or WITH ONE MIND, or DESIGN, the argument, in &s;upport of the cau&s;e we are defending, is equally &s;trong. For it lies in this, that the Chri&s;tians, con&s;tituting the Ephe&s;ian, and other churches, wrote to by Ignatius, are evidently &s;po|ken of as SINGLE CONGREGATIONS, which might, and ordinarily did, meet together for the wor&s;hip of God: and if &s;o, it mu&s;t be IN THE SAME PLACE, and more certainly than with ONE MIND. It is true, if the&s;e churches were PREVIOUSLY known to con&s;i&s;t of a number of congregations, more or le&s;s, each having a Bi&s;hop at their head, as their uniting principle, they might be &s;aid to come together with ONE HEART, UP|ON ONE DESIGN, though the congregations, of which they con&s;i&s;ted, a&s;&s;embled for wor&s;hip in fifty DIFFER|ENT PLACES. But it ought not to be taken for granted, but fir&s;t fully proved, that they were churches of this kind. Until this is done, it ought to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that they were SINGLE CONGREGATIONS; e&s;pecially, as this is the natural and mo&s;t obvious meaning of all the &s;en|tences, in which the phra&s;e is u&s;ed, and of the whole di&s;cour&s;e with which it is connected.</NOTE> is

puffed up with pride.&mdash;Endeavor to meet frequently to prai&s;e and glorify God. For when you are often together in the SAME PLACE, the &s;trength of &s;atan is broken.&mdash;Since EVERY ONE OF YOU BY NAME, with common con&s;ent meet to|gether in one faith, and one Je&s;us Chri&s;t, breaking ONE LOAF, which is the medi|cine of immortality."&mdash;This is proper language, if applied to a &s;ingle &s;ociety of
<PB N="294" REF="012009_0303_0F8942322BA23A20">
wor&s;hipping Chri&s;tians; but not ea&s;ily under&s;tood, if con&s;idered as directed to a dioce&s;an church; or, in other words, a church con&s;tituted of a number of con|gregations, more or le&s;s, incapable of meeting together in one place, and of having per&s;onal communion there in the public offices of religion. It is in|deed, in this way of application, quite unintelligible, unle&s;s we recur to that figurative mode of &s;peech, which was made nece&s;&s;ary in AFTER AGES, when the church began to appear with the evi|dent marks of antichri&s;t.</P>
<P>HE writes to the church in Magne&s;ia in the&s;e words, "When you meet toge|ther, let there be one prayer, one depre|cation, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It has been urged, that the MIA PROSEUCHEE, and MIA DEEESIS, to which the "Magne&s;ian church" is here exhorted, is no proof, that it did not con&s;i&s;t of a number of congregations, who, in DIFFERENT PLA|CES, offered up their prayers to God. It is acknow|ledged, was it a PREVIOUSLY indi&s;puted fact, that this church did con&s;i&s;t of a number of congregati|ons, "the one prayer," and "one &s;upplication," here &s;poken of, ought to be under&s;tood in a &s;en&s;e that would comport with the nature of &s;uch a church. And it is not denied, but that a &s;en&s;e might be invented, in which there might be "one prayer," and "one &s;upplication," though the church, that joins in it, &s;hould a&s;&s;emble in an hundred different places. But what is all this to the purpo&s;e? It is nothing more than fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;ing, with|out proving, that this "Magne&s;ian church" was of the DIOCESAN KIND, a complex body, made ONE by the union of its &s;everal parts with a Bi&s;hop at its head, and then putting a &s;en&s;e on the&s;e words, as grounded on this &s;uppo&s;ition. Such rea&s;oning, if u&s;ed by others, would be called a meer begging the que&s;tion. Every one knows, that the church of England, though a com|plex body, made up of a con&s;iderable number of DIO|CESSES, in each of which there are MANY wor&s;hip|ping a&s;&s;emblies of Chri&s;tians, does, and mu&s;t, join in "one prayer," and in "one &s;upplication", becau&s;e they are obliged to u&s;e preci&s;ely the &s;ame words in their pub|lic addre&s;&s;es to Heaven. And was it as certain, that the churches Ignatius writes to con&s;i&s;ted of a number of wor&s;hipping a&s;&s;emblies, more or le&s;s, who, in their pray|ers, u&s;ed the &s;ame words, no argument could be deduced from their "one prayer," and "one &s;upplication," in evidence of their being &s;ingle &s;ocieties of Chri&s;tians. But the point in que&s;tion is, whether the&s;e churches were DIOCESAN, or SINGLE CONGREGATIONS; and it is a good argument, in proof of the latter, that they are called upon to meet together, that they may unite as ONE in prayer and &s;upplication to God. They might, in &s;ome contrived &s;en&s;e, be &s;aid to do this, if they met in different a&s;&s;emblies; but it ought to be clear|ly and fully proved, that they thus met, before this &s;en&s;e can rea&s;onably be put upon the words. They are mo&s;t naturally, ea&s;ily, and obviou&s;ly applicable to ONE a&s;&s;embly of Chri&s;tians, uniting in prayer to Almighty God: nor &s;hould this &s;en&s;e be departed from, unle&s;s evident nece&s;&s;ity &s;hould call for it.</NOTE> one mind.&mdash;There is one Je|&s;us Chri&s;t, than whom nothing is more

excellent. ALL therefore run together as to ONE TEMPLE of God, as to one AL|TAR, as to one Je&s;us Chri&s;t." Is this &s;peaking to a dioce&s;s, or a particular con|gregation of Chri&s;tians? If common &s;en&s;e may be the judge, there can be no di&s;pute. The ca&s;e is too plain to admit of it.</P>
<P>HE thus be&s;peaks the church in Phila|delphia, "It becomes you, as a church of God to chu&s;e a Deacon to go thither [to Antioch] on a divine emba&s;&s;y, that he
<PB N="296" REF="012009_0305_0F894233AAAAB2F0">
may rejoice with them, being ASSEM|BLED TOGETHER."&mdash;Let me a&s;k here, was it a dioce&s;s, or a &s;ingle congre|gation, who, as a Chri&s;tian church, were to make choice of a me&s;&s;enger to go to Antioch? And was it the church of Chri&s;tians at Antioch, or a whole dio|ce&s;s, that this me&s;&s;enger was to rejoice with, when they had a&s;&s;embled together? No rea&s;onable an&s;wer can be given to the&s;e que&s;tions, but the right one; which is, that a &s;ingle congregation of Chri&s;ti|ans only is addre&s;&s;ed to. It follows in the next words, "Happy in Chri&s;t Je&s;us is he who &s;hall be thought worthy of &s;uch a mini&s;try: if ye be willing, ye may do this for the &s;ake of God; as the other NEIGHBOURING CHURCHES have &s;ent, &s;ome Bi&s;hops, &s;ome Pre&s;byters, and &s;ome
<PB N="297" REF="012009_0306_0F89423552D3BB90">
Deacons." Is the mode of diction, here u&s;ed, epi&s;copalian, or congregational? Is it the practice of dioce&s;&s;es, or &s;ingle con|gregations of Chri&s;tians, to chu&s;e me&s;|&s;engers, and &s;end them to other churches? When NEIGHBOURING churches, with each their own Bi&s;hop, their own Pre&s;byters, and Deacons, are here &s;poken of, can it with propriety, or con&s;i&s;tency, be &s;up|po&s;ed, that the&s;e neighbouring chur|ches were dioce&s;&s;es? Is it not infinitely more natural and rea&s;onable, to under|&s;tand by them &s;ingle congregations?</P>
<P>HE gives the following exhortations in his epi&s;tle to Polycarp, Bi&s;hop of the church at Smyrna, "Let not the wi|dows be neglected, be THOU after God their guardian.&mdash;Let your a&s;&s;emblies be more frequent.&mdash;Enquire after ALL by name. Do not proudly overlook the MEN-SER|VANTS, and the MAID-SERVANTS." The&s;e in&s;tructions are highly pertinent, if Po|lycarp's church was only a congregation of Chri&s;tians at Smyrna; and he might, if he was faithful and diligent, have com|plied with them, to his own honor, and the &s;piritual good of the people who were his &s;pecial charge. But if his church had
<PB N="298" REF="012009_0307_0F894235EB640070">
been of the dioce&s;an kind, what he is ex|horted to is highly ab&s;urd, becau&s;e ab&s;o|lutely impo&s;&s;ible to be put in practice. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">To evade the force of the argument here, it has been &s;aid, by the author of "an original draught of the primitive church," p. 79, 80, that
<Q>the advice to Polycarp was only to do what the primitive Bi&s;hops always did, that is, to keep the names of every member of his church enrolledin, what the ancients called, the MATRICULA [li&s;t or regi&s;ter] of their church. He is advi&s;ed to "inquire out by name," that is, to get &s;uch a regi&s;ter of their names, that upon occa&s;ion of any object of cha|rity propo&s;ed to him, or of any complaint, or appli|cation, made to him about any within his cure or ju|ri&s;diction, &mdash;he might, by means of this general MA|TRICULA, as the other Bi&s;hops did, more directly know, how the ca&s;e &s;tood with them: and which was more than all this, the names thus enrolled in this &s;acred record were per&s;onally entitled then to all the public interce&s;&s;ions, and &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings obtain|ed by the euchari&s;tical prayers, oblations, and &s;acra|ments of the whole church.&mdash;And the&s;e were &s;ufficient rea&s;ons for that apo&s;tolical Father [Ignatius] to mind a Bi&s;hop of the church to be careful of keeping &s;uch a nece&s;&s;ary MATRICULA as this, and an effectual way for St. Polycarp to take care of the meane&s;t and poore&s;t members of his dioce&s;s. But as to the matter of one &s;ingle congregation being then under his care, and that he mu&s;t "per&s;onally know them all by name," as one neighbour knows another, I think they no more imply it, than that Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar had but one town to command, and could know every &s;ubject he had, when (for many political rea&s;ons) he cau&s;ed them all to be enrolled, and required the &s;tate of his empire to be brought in to him.</Q>
Nothing more need be &s;aid to all this than ju&s;t to ob&s;erve, that the ad|vice here given to Polycarp is interpreted, not comfor|mably to the age in which he lived, but to after ages, when Bi&s;hops were at the head of churches known to be dioce&s;&s;es con&s;i&s;ting of numerous a&s;&s;emblies of wor&s;hip|ping Chri&s;tians. It is no wonder, if methods were now contrived for Bi&s;hops to do tho&s;e duties of their office by OTHERS, which they could not perform in their own PERSONS. But it was not thus in the times of Igna|tius. Bi&s;hops were then "in labors more abundant," both public and private, in which they PERSONALLY exerted them&s;elves, and not by tho&s;e who were DEPU|TIES under them. This did not become a cu&s;tom, un|til the love of ea&s;e, grandeur, and power, had got much the better of a zealous concern to promote the true in|tere&s;t of the religion of Je&s;us. There is therefore no ima|ginable good rea&s;on to think, but that the advice here given to Polycarp was, PERSONALLY to acquaint him|&s;elf with his whole church, even the meane&s;t members of it, that he might be able to &s;uit his conduct, upon his own knowledge, to their &s;pecial circum&s;tances. This is evidently that meaning of the words which naturally offers at fir&s;t fight: nor can any other be put upon them, unle&s;s we needle&s;ly, I may rather &s;ay unrea&s;ona|bly, repair to times greatly di&s;tant from tho&s;e, in which Ignatius and Polycarp &s;u&s;tained the office of Bi|&s;hops, and take our idea of the advice here given, not from their times, but tho&s;e after-ones, when there was a vi&s;ible and &s;ignal difference, not only in the external circum&s;tances, but the known employment, of tho&s;e who were then Bi&s;hops. There is no hint given, within the two fir&s;t centuries, of the MATRICULA, this author &s;peaks of; or of a Bi&s;hops acting in his cure, as Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar did, with re&s;pect to an enrollment of the people under his command. We mu&s;t come down to tho&s;e ages, in which Bi&s;hops more nearly re&s;embled Emperors, than they did in the days of Ignatius, before we &s;hall find the lea&s;t rea&s;on to in|terpret his advice to Polycarp, in a &s;en&s;e different from that we have taken it in.</NOTE> Be&s;ides, what dioce&s;an Bi&s;hop ever ima|gined it was his duty to inquire after ALL within his dioce&s;s by NAME, not over|looking even SERVANTS? mo&s;t certainly no one among this kind of Bi&s;hops ever performed, or endeavored to perform, this

his being "deprived of the bread of God who comes not to the "one altar." The&s;e phra&s;es are all readily under&s;tood, upon the &s;uppo&s;ition, that Ignatius is writing to &s;ingle congregations; but otherwi&s;e there is no &s;en&s;e in what he &s;ays, unle&s;s we make him &s;peak figuratively, when there is no need of it. A &s;ingle congrega|tion of Chri&s;tians, &s;uch an one as he is all along writing to, may come to "one altar," or communion-table; they may all "break" of the &s;ame &s;acramental "loaf:" whereas, it is impo&s;&s;ible, a Bi&s;hop with his whole dioce&s;s &s;hould literally do the&s;e things. They cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed

to do them, without calling in the help of a &s;trong and bold figure. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When Chri&s;tian churches, in proce&s;s of time, con&s;i&s;ted of numerous a&s;&s;emblies, who had each their "altar," their "euchari&s;t," their &s;acramental "loaf," the invention of man contrived a &s;en&s;e, in which the&s;e "altars," "euchari&s;ts," and "loaves," though NUMEROUS, might be called ONE; not indeed in the SAME, but DIFFERENT RESPECTS. But this metaphy&s;ical dex|terity did not come into u&s;e, until long after the age of Ignatius: for which rea&s;on, it is delu&s;ive, to &s;ay no|thing wor&s;e, to apply the&s;e DIFFERENT RESPECTS to his "one altar," "one euchari&s;t," and "one loaf;" making them MANY, and yet ONE, in RESPECTS that were never &s;o much as thought of in his day. I have never yet &s;een, within the two fir&s;t centuries, nor until the art of man was evidently employed to vindi|cate corruption in the church of God, &s;o much as a &s;in|gle in&s;tance of the mode of &s;peaking here applied to the truly primitive Ignatius. Let &s;uch an in&s;tance be pro|duced, if any are able to do it. Until then, it will be to no purpo&s;e to tell us, that, in ancient times, there was only "one altar," and "one &s;acramental loaf," in a Chri&s;tian church in ONE RESPECT, though in ANO|THER there were &s;ome hundreds. It was not the man|ner, in truly primitive times, to MULTIPLY altars in ONE SENSE, and make them all but ONE in another. We may not look for this, until the church was far gone in antichri&s;tian corruption.</NOTE>&mdash;But I may not enlarge. It would be an affront to the reader's under&s;tanding, &s;hould I &s;ay any thing more upon a point &s;o obviou&s;ly evident.</P>
<P>IT will perhaps be pleaded, it is a cir|cum&s;tancial matter only, whether a
<PB N="302" REF="012009_0311_0F894238ECA90390">
Bi&s;hop's church be great or &s;mall. His e&s;|&s;ential powers are the &s;ame, whether it con&s;i&s;ts of a &s;ingle congregation only, or a number, more or le&s;s. This, as I ap|prehend, is a fundamental mi&s;take upon this head. Dioce&s;an, and parochial, or congregational, epi&s;copacy e&s;&s;entially dif|fer, and are, in the nature of the thing, &s;ubver&s;ive of each other. Scores, or hundreds, of parochial Bi&s;hops mu&s;t be deprived of the proper powers of their of|fice, to make way for one &s;uch dioce&s;an, as the Engli&s;h Bi&s;hop is known to be. The plain truth is, dioce&s;an epi&s;copacy is an invention of man, wholly a political con&s;titution; and, I believe, e&s;&s;entially wrong: as it is impo&s;&s;ible a dioce&s;an Bi|&s;hop &s;hould do the duty of the Bi&s;hop's office, as de&s;cribed in the new te&s;tament, or even in the "epi&s;tles of Ignatius;" and the placing Bi&s;hops at the head of large dioce&s;&s;es, in&s;tead of tending to &s;erve the intere&s;t of Chri&s;t's &s;piritual kingdom, has been greatly hurtful to it, in all ages from the fir&s;t ri&s;e of antichri&s;t to this day. But however this be, which does not fall &s;o directly within our pre&s;ent de&s;ign, thus much is certain, that the IGNATIAN Bi&s;hop was not a DIOCESAN one, and
<PB N="303" REF="012009_0312_0F894239AC43E0F0">
that, if his Bi&s;hop is to be the pattern, or exemplar, there is not a Bi&s;hop in all En|gland conformed to it. The Bi&s;hops, or Pa&s;tors, of parochial, or congregational, churches do much more nearly re&s;emble the Bi&s;hop held out to view in "his epi&s;|tles." &mdash;But to go on,</P>
<P>IGNATIUS is not only &s;ilent about dio|ce&s;an Bi&s;hops, but the powers of GOVERN|MENT, ORDINATION, and CONFIRMA|TION, as appropriated to Bi&s;hops of any kind, as an order di&s;tinct from Pre&s;byters.</P>
<P>TO begin with GOVERNMENT. And here it ought to be ob&s;erved, there was, in each of the churches Ignatius wrote to, a PRESBYTERY, or, in other words, a number of Pre&s;byters, more or le&s;s, con|&s;tituting a council, &s;enate, college, or whatever other name any may plea&s;e to give it, of which the Bi&s;hop was the fir&s;t, or chief, having &s;ome degree of &s;uperiority beyond the re&s;t. But that the govern|ment of the church, or of the Pre&s;byters of it, was SOLELY in his hands; or that his precedency was &s;uch, as imported his being of another and higher ORDER than
<PB N="304" REF="012009_0313_0F89423A6CB246A8">
that of Pre&s;byters, he has no where given us to under&s;tand, in any of his epi&s;|tles. Far from this, the general &s;train of them all is, to lead us into the thought, that all church-affairs were to be direct|ed, and governed, not by the SOLE POW|ER OF THE BISHOP&punc; but by the authority and voice of the PRESBYTERY joined to his. This is &s;o obvious, that no one can ea&s;ily read his epi&s;tles without perceiving it to be the truth of fact. The evidence is too glaring not to be &s;een at once.</P>
<P>IT is acknowledged, Ignatius &s;peaks of Bi&s;hops, in the&s;e epi&s;tles, in a high &s;train of language, &s;uch as calls for great can|dor to free it from, at lea&s;t, &s;ome degree of profanity. But the &s;ame may be &s;aid, with as real truth, in regard of the man|ner in which he &s;peaks of Pre&s;byters. Does he call Bi&s;hops "the figure of the Father?" He goes on to call Pre&s;byters, "the council of God, and conjunction of the Apo&s;tles." Does he &s;peak of the Bi|&s;hop as "the grace of God?" He, in the &s;ame place, &s;peaks of the Pre&s;bytery as "law of Chri&s;t." Does he repre&s;ent the Bi&s;hop as "pre&s;iding in the place of God?"
<PB N="305" REF="012009_0314_0F89423B2CA565C8">
At the &s;ame time, he puts the Pre&s;byters "in the room of the apo&s;tolic &s;enate."</P>
<P>IT is acknowledged likewi&s;e, he fre|quently exhorts the churches to "obey their Bi&s;hops," to be in "&s;ubjection to them." But he enjoins it on them, in like manner, to be "&s;ubject to their Pre&s;|byters." And the language in which he exhorts them to obedience and &s;ubjection to their Pre&s;byters, as well as Bi&s;hops, is not only very &s;trong and pre&s;&s;ing, but &s;o often repeated as to be really di&s;gu&s;t|ful. "Attend to the Bi&s;hop and Pre&s;|bytery;" follow the Bi&s;hop, and the Pre&s;|byters;" "obey the Bi&s;hop, and Pre&s;byters;" be "&s;ubject to the Bi&s;hop, and Pre&s;by|tery," are injunctions, in the&s;e epi&s;tles, &s;o frequent as to be, at once, both needle&s;s, and trouble&s;ome.</P>
<P>SHOULD it be &s;aid here, he gives the church of Smyrna to under&s;tand, "it is not lawful without the Bi&s;hop either to bapti&s;e, or make a love-fea&s;t;" and ac|cordingly exhorts, "let none do any of tho&s;e things which belong to the church without the Bi&s;hop." Should it be added,
<PB N="306" REF="012009_0315_0F89423BEB910F98">
he tells the church of Tralles, "it is nece&s;&s;ary they &s;hould act nothing with|out the Bi&s;hop." The an&s;wer is ready at hand; he as expre&s;&s;ly tells the &s;ame church of Tralles, and in the &s;ame epi&s;|tle, "he that does any thing without the Bi&s;hop, and Pre&s;byters, is not of a pure con&s;cience." And in his epi&s;tle to the Magne&s;ians, the exhortation is, "Nei|ther do ye any thing without the Bi&s;hop and Pre&s;byters." And again, "I exhort you to do all things in the concord of God." What is that? The explanation follows in the next words, "the Bi&s;hop pre&s;iding in the place of God, and the Pre&s;byters in the place of the apo&s;tolic &s;enate."&mdash;"Let nothing divide you, but be united to the Bi&s;hop, and tho&s;e that pre&s;ide among you." It &s;hould &s;eem, from the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, and many more that might ea&s;ily be mentioned, if there was need of it, as plainly evident as words can well make it, that the Ignatian churches were governed, not by the Bi&s;hop only, but by a common college, company, or &s;enate, of which he was the fir&s;t in &s;u|periority. If nothing was to be done without the Bi&s;hop; neither was any
<PB N="307" REF="012009_0316_0F89423CAB6C4D70">
thing to be done without the Pre&s;byters. The voice of the Pre&s;bytery was nece&s;&s;a|ry, as truly as the voice of the Bi&s;hop. UNION was plainly the great thing Igna|tius had at heart, and would promote in the management of all church-affairs, not only between the church, and the Bi&s;hop; but between the Bi&s;hop, and the Pre&s;byters; &s;uch an union as that no|thing &s;hould be tran&s;acted without the Pre&s;byters, any more than without the Bi&s;hop. His aim was, that there &s;hould be the united authority and con&s;ent of both Bi&s;hops and Pre&s;byters, in the con|duct of every church-affair.</P>
<P>IT will, probably, be &s;till pleaded, Ig|natius is &s;o careful, in all his epi&s;tles, to di&s;tingui&s;h Bi&s;hops from Pre&s;byters, that we do not once find him calling Pre&s;by|ters, Bi&s;hops; or Bi&s;hops, Pre&s;byters. Far from this, he has always appropriated the&s;e names to different per&s;ons; from whence it may be fairly and ju&s;tly col|lected, that Bi&s;hops were a di&s;tinct &s;et of officers in the government of the church from Pre&s;byters, of an higher order
<PB N="308" REF="012009_0317_0F89423D6EE45178">
and ve&s;ted with &s;uperior powers, &s;uch as might not be exerci&s;ed by Pre&s;byters.</P>
<P>IT is granted, the names, Bi&s;hop and Presbyter, are carefully u&s;ed, in the Igna|tian epi&s;tles, to &s;pecify different per&s;ons; but, at the &s;ame time, utterly denied, that this appropriation of the&s;e names imports &s;uch a di&s;tinction between Bi&s;hops and Pre&s;byters, as is contended for; that is, a di&s;tinction that &s;uppo&s;es an higher and &s;uperior order of officers in the church to that of Presbyters. That it imports &s;ome degree of precedency, or &s;uperiority, is readily allowed; but why &s;hould it be thought, unle&s;s to &s;erve the epi&s;copal cau&s;e, that this &s;uperiority was a &s;uperi|ority in &s;uch &s;piritual powers as might not be exerci&s;ed by Presbyters? Ignati|us, as we &s;hall &s;ee pre&s;ently, has &s;aid no &s;uch thing; nor has he, in any of his epi&s;tles, appropriated any one of the powers proper to the mini&s;terial office to Bi&s;hops, in di&s;tinction from Presbyters. Epi&s;copalians, if any men in the world, &s;hould be &s;en&s;ible of the in&s;ufficiency of the argument, which would prove a di&s;|tinction of ORDERS in the church, or of
<PB N="309" REF="012009_0318_0F89423E2AAA4590">
ESSENTIAL POWERS in its officers, from the appropriation of different names to different per&s;ons, even though it was an appropriation that carried with it a very con&s;iderable degree of precedency and &s;uperiority. There are, in the church of England, a great variety of officers, with appropriated names, who greatly differ in the degree of their &s;uperiotity and inferiority; while yet, their e&s;&s;ential pow|ers, as officers in the kingdom of Chri&s;t, are preci&s;ely the &s;ame. The names, Arch-Bi&s;hop and Bi&s;hop, are appropriated ones, invariably pointing out different eccle|&s;ia&s;tical officers, the one &s;uperior in dig|nity and power to the other; and yet, Arch-Bi&s;hops are the &s;ame order in the church with Bi&s;hops, and they have no higher e&s;&s;ential powers. To &s;ay that they have would make FOUR ORDERS in the church of Chri&s;t, in&s;tead of THREE; which would be a flat contradiction to the avowed doctrine of the church of England it&s;elf. Deans, Arch-Deacons, Prebends. Rectors, and Curates, are all of them officers in the Engli&s;h church, di&s;tingui&s;hed from each other by the ap|plication of the&s;e names, and &s;everally
<PB N="310" REF="012009_0319_0F89423FD3FA74C8">
placed above each other in certain degrees of &s;uperiority; and yet, they are all ve&s;ted with exactly the &s;ame e&s;&s;ential powers. In regard of their ORDER, they are the &s;ame officers in the church. In &s;pecial, Rector and Curate are appropria|ted names, and &s;tand to &s;ignify different officers in the church, the one &s;uperior in dignity and power to the other; while yet, they both &s;u&s;tain the &s;ame rank, and are perfectly equal in the intrin&s;ic in&s;titu|ted powers of their office. The Curate is commi&s;&s;ioned to preach, bapti&s;e, and admini&s;ter the Lord's &s;upper, as truly as the Rector; and may, as well as he, per|form any other part of duty that belongs to this order of officers in the church. But this notwith&s;tanding, the Rector is placed in as high a degree of &s;uperiority above the Curate, as the Ignatian Bi&s;hop is above a Pre&s;byter. The Rector may, in the plenitude of his own power, do any thing, within the limits of his office, in his own pari&s;h; the Curate can do no|thing but by his permi&s;&s;ion. He can neither read prayers, preach, bapti&s;e, or perform any other public religious &s;er|vice, but in con&s;equence of his con&s;ent|ing
<PB N="311" REF="012009_0320_0F8942406B5FE5A8">
allowance. He is in truth the &s;er|vant of the Rector, and in perfect &s;ubjec|tion to him; yea, liable, unle&s;s quite &s;ub|&s;ervient to his plea&s;ure, to be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from &s;ervice in this cure. Wherein, now, in what in&s;tance, was the Ignatian Bi|&s;hop more of a &s;uperior to his Pre&s;byters? What greater power had he over them? I may rather &s;ay, how does it appear, that he either had, or ever exerci&s;ed, &s;o high a degree of power? The Rector may act, in his own pari&s;h, without the advice of his Curate; or, &s;hould he con|de&s;cend to a&s;k it, he may act in direct op|po&s;ition to it. It was not thus with the Ignatian-Bi&s;hop. He, with the Pre&s;|byters of the church, made one common council, or &s;enate; and it was, not accor|ding to his own &s;overeignty, but in agree|ment with the united voice of this council, that he acted. All the affairs of the church were managed in this way.&mdash;The Rec|tor may, of his own meer arbitrary will, di&s;charge the Curate from any fur|ther &s;ervice in his pari&s;h. Ignatius's Bi|&s;hop had no &s;uch power. Mo&s;t certainly it is no where &s;aid that he had, either in his "epi&s;tles," or el&s;ewhere. Let me
<PB N="312" REF="012009_0321_0F8942412E189D08">
a&s;k now, why &s;hould it be thought, that the Ignatian Bi&s;hop's &s;uperiority above a Pre&s;byter mu&s;t import a &s;uperiority of ORDER, or ESSENTIAL POWERS, any more than a Rector's &s;uperiority above his Curate &s;hould import the &s;ame thing? If a Rector's office is ESSENTIALLY the &s;ame with his Curate's, notwith&s;tanding his &s;uperiority in power, why mu&s;t it be otherwi&s;e in the ca&s;e of Ignatius's Bi&s;hop? The plain truth is, all the pre-eminence and &s;uperiority that Ignatius a&s;cribes to his Bi&s;hop may as ea&s;ily, and as ju&s;tly, be accounted for, without the &s;uppo&s;ition of his being of an ORDER di&s;tinct from, and &s;uperior to, Pre&s;byters, as the Rector's &s;uperiority above his Curate. If, notwith|&s;tanding the &s;ubjection of his Curate to him, they are both of the &s;ame order in the church, and partake of the &s;ame e&s;|&s;ential powers; why may not the &s;ame be &s;aid, with equal truth and ju&s;tice, of the Ignatian Bi&s;hop and his Pre&s;byters? E&s;pecially, if it be remembered, and duly con&s;idered, that no one mini&s;terial pow|er is mentioned by Ignatius, in any of his epi&s;tles, but what might be as well exer|ci&s;ed by Pre&s;byters as Bi&s;hops. And this leads to</P>
<P><PB N="313" REF="012009_0322_0F894241EC355E18">THE next power of Bi&s;hops, &s;aid to be di&s;tingui&s;hing, and e&s;&s;ential; which is that of ORDINATION. And who could think, con&s;idering the va&s;t labor that has been expended in &s;upport of the credit of Ignatius's epi&s;tles, and the perpetual u&s;e Epi&s;copalians make of them, in defence of their cau&s;e, but that he had expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, upon this head, &s;o clearly, po&s;i|tively, and fully, as to leave no further room for di&s;pute, at lea&s;t, whether it was a FACT, in his day, that Bi&s;hops, and they only, communicated holy orders? E&s;pecially, as the validity of go&s;pel-ad|mini&s;trations is made to depend upon this method of communication. And yet, we are as much at a lo&s;s for evidence in favor of this article, e&s;&s;entially connected with the very being of Chri&s;tianity it&s;elf, as if Ignatius had never wrote any one of his epi&s;tles. He can no more be brought as a witne&s;s to te&s;tify in behalf of EPISCOPAL-ORDINATION, either in point of FACT, or RIGHT, than any of his predece&s;&s;ors, contemporaries, or &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors within the two fir&s;t centuries.

&s;u&s;pect he had &s;o much as tran&s;iently &s;aid any thing that looks like ORDINA|TION; but this he may have done in his "epi&s;tle to the Magne&s;ians," wherein he tells them, "It becomes you not to u&s;e your Bi&s;hop too familiarly upon the ac|count of his youth, but to yield all re|verence to him, according to the power of God the Father: as al&s;o I perceive your holy Pre&s;byters do; not con&s;idering <HI>his age, which indeed to appearance is young.</HI>"&mdash;The&s;e la&s;t words are in the original, <HI>t&ecirc;n phainomen&ecirc;n neoterik&ecirc;n taxin</HI>; which &s;ome have tran&s;lated, <HI>his appearing youthful ordination.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thus I find them tran&s;lated by Cotelerius, in Le 'Clerc's edition of his "apo&s;tolical Fathers."

In Arch-Bi|&s;hop U&s;her's publication of the "Ignatian epi&s;tles," from the latin copies he found in England, the ver&s;ion is, "apparentem juniorem ordinem;" which is thought to refer to his being "ve&s;ted with holy orders while apparent|ly a young man." I will not oppo&s;e this interpretation of the words, being willing Epi&s;copalians &s;hould make the mo&s;t of what can be &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;aid by Ignatius.</NOTE> If this is a ver&s;ion that gives the true meaning of Ignatius, he has once, in &s;even epi&s;tles, mentioned ORDINATION; but without &s;aying, how it was performed, or by whom; whether by a Bi&s;hop of &s;ome other church, or by
<PB N="315" REF="012009_0324_0F8942436B3B7D58">
the Pre&s;byters of this at Magne&s;ia. The &s;hort of the matter is, he is totally &s;ilent, in all his epi&s;tles, upon this mo&s;t impor|tant and e&s;&s;ential power of the Bi&s;hop; never once &s;aying, or &s;o much as in&s;inu|ating, that it was his PECULIAR RIGHT to confer holy orders, or that they were, in FACT, ever conferred by Bi&s;hops, in di&s;tinction from Pre&s;byters.</P>
<P>IT will, perhaps, be pleaded here, Ig|natius has expre&s;&s;ly &s;aid, "it is not law|ful without the Bi&s;hop to bapti&s;e, or make a love fea&s;t;" and again, "it is nece&s;&s;ary nothing &s;hould be done with|out the Bi&s;hop." If &s;o, then &s;urely there ought to be no ordination without him. This is the obvious and evident implica|tion of his words.</P>
<P>THE an&s;wer is plain and ea&s;y. Should this rea&s;oning be allowed to be ju&s;t and valid, it will not follow from it, that the power of ordination was appropriated to Bi&s;hops, any more than the admini&s;tration of bapti&s;m, or making a love-fea&s;t. The mo&s;t that can be made of it is, that no church-affair &s;hould be managed without

the con&s;ent, the pre&s;ence, or permi&s;|&s;ion of the Bi&s;hop; but with his allow|ance, for aught that appears to the con|trary, Pre&s;byters might ORDAIN, as well as bapti&s;e, or admini&s;ter the Lord's &s;up|per. And it is, with me, pa&s;t all doubt, that the affair of ORDINATION, as truly as other religious offices, were managed, not by the BISHOP ALONE, but by the PRES|BYTERY, of which he was primus inter pares. For Ignatius is as expre&s;s in &s;ay|ing, "nothing ought to be done with|out the PRESBYTERS," as that "nothing ought to be done without the BISHOP."</P>
<P>THE la&s;t peculiar power of Bi&s;hops is that which relates to CONFIRMATION. But it unluckily happens, that the "Ig|natian epi&s;tles" are, if po&s;&s;ible, more &s;ilent about this, than the foregoing ar|ticle. They neither mention the name, or the thing intended by the name. And as they appear to be utter &s;trangers to any &s;uch cu&s;tom in the church of Chri&s;t, as that of confirmation, it would be in vain to look to them for evidence, that it belonged to Bi&s;hops, to them only, to them in di&s;tinction from Pre&s;byters,

to perform this extraordinary piece of &s;ervice.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, notwith&s;tanding Bi&s;hops are &s;o often mentioned by name by Ignatius; notwith&s;tanding the high &s;train of language in which he &s;peaks of them; notwith&s;tanding all the claims he makes for them, and of obedience and &s;ubjection to them;&mdash;he is &s;o far from being a competent witne&s;s to the GRAND FACTS we are upon, that he either &s;ays nothing relative to them, or that which is really de&s;tructive of them. It is as evi|dent as words can well make it, that the Bi&s;hops he &s;peaks of, in his epi&s;tles, were of the PAROCHIAL, not the DIOCESAN kind: from whence it follows, that the Rector, Pa&s;tor, or Bi&s;hop of a SINGLE CONGREGATION of Chri&s;tians, &s;uch an one as the churches in New-England, and the Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters at home, have at their head, is much more like to the IG|NATIAN Bi&s;hop, than any DIOCESAN in Great Britain. From the whole tenor of what he offers upon the head of government it al&s;o mo&s;t obviou&s;ly appears, as we have &s;een, that it was, and ought to be, manag|ed,
<PB N="318" REF="012009_0327_0F894245AC477AD0">
not by the Bi&s;hop as SOLE MONARCH in the church, but by a common &s;enate, or college, of which he was nothing more than primus inter pares, being ve&s;t|ed with no higher ESSENTIAL POWERS than the other members of the Pre&s;by|tery. And as to ORDINATION, and CON|FIRMATION, the appropriated right of Bi|&s;hops, he &s;ays not a word.

<P>PAPIAS, Bi&s;hop of Hierapolis, a city in A&s;ia, is &s;aid by Irenaeus to have been "an hearer of John, and compani|on of Polycarp." He unque&s;tionably meant by John, the writer of the go&s;pel, and the three epi&s;tles under this name. Dr. Cave places him at the year 110; but he is &s;aid by others, equally learned, to have flouri&s;hed about the years 115 and 116. He has &s;ometimes been mentioned as a martyr; but, as neither Eu&s;ebius or Jerom &s;ay any thing of this, it may be con&s;idered as a fact not to be depend|ed on. The time, as well as manner, of his death is uncertain. Irenaeus and Eu|&s;ebius both &s;peak of him as having wrote "five books" entitled "the explication of our Lord's di&s;cour&s;es;" but nothing remains of them except a few fragments

This book is yet extant among diver&s;e of the brethren, and a copy of it remaineth with us; in which there are con&s;picuous marks of the un|der&s;tanding, and true apo&s;tolic doctrine of the man."

<P>ARISTIDES flouri&s;hed about the &s;ame time. He is celebrated by Eu&s;ebius, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">H. E. Ibid.</NOTE> as "a faithful man, and one that labored for the furtherance of religion." He adds, "he publi&s;hed an "apology" (as Qua|dratus did before) for the "Chri&s;tian faith,"
<PB N="326" REF="012009_0335_0F89424C6C817E60">
with a "dedicatory epi&s;tle" to Adrian the Emperor; which book of his is kept by many, even to this day." And it was in being in the days of Jerom; for he writes both of this "apology," and its author, in the&s;e words; "Ari&s;tides was an eloquent Athenian Philo&s;opher, who, when he changed his religion, did not alter his profe&s;&s;ion. He pre&s;ented unto the Em|peror Adrian, at the time when Qua|dratus did, a volume in the form of an "apology," wherein he produced the proofs of our religion; which, being &s;till extant, &s;hews the learned how excellent a writer he was." He &s;ays again, "that this work was full of philo&s;ophical notions, and that it was afterwards imitated by Ju&s;tin." It has long been buried in ob|livion. Dr. Grabe has not been able, in his "&s;picilegium patrum," to gratify the curious with &s;o much as the &s;mal|le&s;t fragment of it.</P>
<P>AGRIPPA, &s;irnamed Ca&s;tor, was con|temporary with the above Fathers. His abilities, as a learned man, and his zeal in defending the truly apo&s;tolic doctrine, are &s;aid to have appeared in a book he wrote again&s;t the "here&s;y of Ba&s;ilides,"

He affirmed al&s;o, that this heretic taught his followers, "that it was a thing indifferent to eat &s;acrifices that were offered to idols; that it was lawful to renounce the faith in a time of per&s;ecution; and that, in imitation of Pythagoras, he impo&s;ed &s;ilence on his di&s;|ciples for the &s;pace of five years."

Eu&s;ebius ranks him among the fir&s;t who lived, and flouri&s;hed, after the death of the Apo&s;tles. He &s;peaks of him&s;elf, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eu&s;eb. H. E. Lib. iv.

This he is &s;aid to have done, dividing it into "five books," &s;tiled "commentaries" by Eu&s;ebius and Je|rom; wherein he relates the principal occurrences in the church, from the death of Chri&s;t to his own time. This work was penned, according to Eu&s;ebius, "in a &s;imple &s;tile;" and, as Jerom &s;peaks, "in imitation of the manner of tho&s;e who&s;e lives he wrote." There are no remains of it, but &s;ome fragments pre&s;erved by Eu&s;ebius in his eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory, and one more by Photius from Stephen Gobar.</P>

<P>BESIDES the five books beforemen|tioned, five more are attributed to him; containing "an hi&s;tory of the wars of the Jews," and of the "taking the city of Jeru&s;alem," which have been often printed, and, among other places, at Co|len, with the notes of Galterius. But there are few writers, who think it worth while &s;o much as to mention the&s;e works, they are &s;o evidently of the &s;purious kind.

<P>THE preci&s;e time of his conver&s;ion can|not be a&s;certained. Dr. Cave, and Til|lemont place it at the year 132 or 133.

<Q>For my own part, being yet detained under the "Plato|nic in&s;titutions," when I heard the Chri&s;tians traduced and reproached, and yet &s;aw them fearle&s;&s;ly ru&s;hing upon death, and venturing upon all tho&s;e things that are accounted mo&s;t

dreadful and amazing to human na|ture, I concluded with my&s;elf, it was impo&s;&s;ible that tho&s;e men &s;hould wal|low in vice, and be carried away with the love of lu&s;t and plea&s;ure. For what man, that is a &s;lave to plea&s;ure and intemperance, can chearfully bid death welcome, which he knows mu&s;t put a period to all his plea&s;ures and delights; and would not rather by all means endeavor to prolong his life as much as is po&s;&s;ible, and to delude his adver&s;aries, and conceal him&s;elf from the notice of the Magi&s;trate, rather than voluntarily betray and offer him|&s;elf to pre&s;ent execution?</Q>
&mdash;His rea|&s;oning here is certainly ju&s;t: nor is it &s;trange, that &s;uch extraordinary &s;trength of mind in Chri&s;tians to bear up under the greate&s;t dangers, and undergo the mo&s;t cruel &s;ufferings and deaths, &s;hould give him favorable thoughts of the reli|gion they profe&s;&s;ed, and the truth of which they &s;o chearfully &s;ealed with their blood. Marvellous effects have been pro|duced in the hearts of tho&s;e, who have been &s;pectators of the horrid cruelties which have been exerci&s;ed towards the di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t, and the amazing

patience, meekne&s;s, fortitude, and &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion, with which they endured them.</P>
<P>HAVING profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf a Chri&s;tian, he is &s;aid to have led an eminently vir|tuous and holy life. It is certain, he &s;tood up nobly in the Chri&s;tian cau&s;e; and it ought always to be remembered to his honor, that, in a time of hot per&s;ecution, when a man's only owning him&s;elf to be a Chri&s;tian was &s;ufficient to expo&s;e him to death, he &s;hould be able to put on re|&s;olution enough to become an advocate for Chri&s;tians, a public pleader of their cau&s;e; as he appears to have been by his two "apologies" in their behalf.</P>
<P>HE was at Rome, in the reign of "Antonine the pious," when the per|&s;ecution began to break forth; and he then wrote an excellent "apology" in their defence, and preferred it (as ap|pears from the in&s;cription) to "Antoninus Pius the Emperor, and to his two &s;ons Verus and Lucius, to the &s;enate, and by them to the whole people of Rome." This he did about the year 150, &s;ays Du|pin. Tillemont and Dr. Grabe think it was not pre&s;ented before this year.

Dr. Cave fixes the time at 140. Pagi and Ba&s;nage at 139; who&s;e opinion, &s;ays Dr. Lardener, "appears to me the true&s;t, for the rea&s;ons alledged by tho&s;e learn|ed men."</P>
<P>THIS

<P>WHAT Ju&s;tin had principally in view, in this "apology" was,
<Q>to repre&s;ent the inju&s;tice of the proceedings again&s;t the Chri&s;tians; for that, without any enquiry into the true merits of their ca&s;e, they were adjudged to death as the mo&s;t impious, and flagitious of all men; only their being called by the name of Chri&s;tians, being accounted &s;ufficient for their condemnation.&mdash;He ju&s;tifies them again&s;t the calumnies

that had been wickedly ca&s;t upon them; offering what was abundantly &s;uffi|cient to clear up their innocency. He particularly &s;hews, that they were not <HI>Athei&s;ts,</HI> as they had been characteri&s;ed; becau&s;e, though they wor&s;hipped not the gods of the heathen, yet they knew the true God, and performed that &s;er|vice which was agreable to him&punc; al&s;o, that they looked not for an earthly kingdom (as was &s;u&s;pected of them, and for which cau&s;e the Romans were fearful of their rebellion), but one that was divine and heavenly, on which account they were willing to run the hazard, and &s;uffer the lo&s;s, of this pre&s;ent life, which they never could do, were they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with de|&s;ires of reigning in this world. He likewi&s;e wipes off tho&s;e bla&s;phemies wherewith the Chri&s;tians were load|ed for their wor&s;hipping a "crucified man," by &s;uch as were altogether ig|norant of the my&s;tery of the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t; &s;hewing that the religion of &s;uch as wor&s;hipped the gods was but a vain and &s;ordid &s;uper&s;tition.

&s;uffering on the cro&s;s, and by convinc|ing arguments proves the truth of the Chri&s;tian faith; not forgetting to re|pre&s;ent the harmle&s;s lives of Chri&s;tians, their exact ob&s;ervance of cha&s;tity, pa|tience, peaceablene&s;s, gentlene&s;s, and love, even to their very enemies. In fine, he lays before them the manner of Chri&s;tians in their celebration of the &s;acred rites of bapti&s;m and the Lord's &s;upper, and their other ob&s;ervances; which he cho&s;e to do, becau&s;e of the ba&s;e &s;landers that had been rai&s;ed, and &s;cattered abroad, concerning them; as if horrible and abominable things were practi&s;ed by them in their &s;ecret meetings upon &s;uch occa&s;ions.</Q>
The "apology" is wrote with a freedom and boldne&s;s, becoming a &s;erious, zealous, and powerful advocate in pleading the cau&s;e of truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s. And it had its de&s;ired &s;ucce&s;s. For the Emperor, moved by this apology, as well as by other notices he had received, gave order that the Chri&s;tians henceforward &s;hould be treated in a regular and more gentle way; as appears from his "epi&s;tle to the commonality of A&s;ia," pre&s;erved by Eu&s;ebius, in the ivth book, and 13th

chapter of his eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory, by Ju&s;tin him&s;elf in his &s;econd apology, and from them, by other writers. The En|gli&s;h reader may meet with it, in a lan|guage he under&s;tands, in Dr. Cave's lives of the Fathers.</P>
<P>THE "&s;econd apology," &s;ome few &s;entences of which are lo&s;t, does not com|prehend &s;uch variety of matter: it is a complaint or remon&s;trance directed to the Emperor, repre&s;enting the injuries that were unju&s;tly offered to the Chri&s;tians; and making an&s;wer to the things object|ed again&s;t them. In this "apology," he de&s;cribes the &s;nares that were laid for him by a certain Cynic Philo&s;opher, named "Cre&s;cens," through who&s;e procurement he expected to &s;uffer death. "I expect, (&s;ays he) by &s;ome of tho&s;e who fal&s;ely call them&s;elves Philo&s;ophers, to be be|trayed, or brought to the &s;take or tree; it may be by this Cre&s;cens, a lover of popular applau&s;e, and of in&s;olent arrogance; a man unworthy to be called a Philo&s;opher, be|cau&s;e he publicly witne&s;&s;es the things which he knoweth not, as if the Chri&s;|tians were athei&s;tical and impious; and all to be in favor with, and plea&s;e, the multitudes whom he hath deceived."</P>
<P><PB N="342" REF="012009_0351_0F8942592C8362C0">IT was not long before it happened according to what he had &s;ugge&s;ted. For we are told, by Tatian, a di&s;ciple of Ju&s;|tin, that this &s;ame "Cre&s;cens" procured his death, which he &s;uffered, &s;ays Du|pin, in the &s;ixth year of the reign of Mar|cus Antoninus, the Philo&s;opher; that is, in the year of Chri&s;t 160. Dr. Cave &s;ays, in 164. Tillemont, in 167 or 168. Fabricus &s;uppo&s;es he was born in 89, and &s;uffered martyrdom in the 74th year of his age, A. D. 163.

<P>HIS name is often mentioned with ho|nor by the ancient Chri&s;tian writers. Ta|tian calls him "an admirable man." Methodius &s;ays, "he was not far re|moved from the Apo&s;tles in time, or virtue". Eu&s;ebius mentions him as one that was "famous, not long after the Apo&s;tles, an embracer of the true philo|&s;ophy, and well &s;tudied and exerci&s;ed in the doctrine of the Gentiles." Photius &s;ays, "he was well acquainted with the Chri&s;tian philo&s;ophy, and e&s;pecially with the heathen; rich in the knowledge of hi&s;tory, and other parts of learning.

But he took little care to &s;et off the native beauty of philo&s;ophy with the ornaments of rhetoric. For which rea&s;on, his di&s;|cour&s;es, though weighty and learned, want tho&s;e allurements which are apt to attract the vulgar." He adds, "He &s;hewed him&s;elf a Philo&s;opher not only in words, but in his actions, and his <HI>habit.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Says Dr. Cave, "Though he laid a&s;ide his former profe&s;|&s;ion, he &s;till retained his ancient garb, preaching and de|fending (as Eu&s;ebius, and Jerom report) the Chri&s;tian religion under his old "philo&s;ophic" habit, which was the "pallium," or "cloak," the u&s;ual badge of the Greek Philo&s;ophers, and which tho&s;e Chri&s;tians &s;till kept to, who, before their conver&s;ion, had been pro|fe&s;&s;ed Philo&s;ophers.

<P>I SHALL only add concerning this Fa|ther, that, though he appears to have been a man of con&s;iderable learning, and very conver&s;ant with the &s;acred writings, yet his rea&s;oning &s;ometimes will not bear being clo&s;ely examined; nor are his in|terpretations of the &s;cripture always &s;uch, as would be admired in this age of the world. He does not &s;eem to have been &s;tudious of art in &s;etting off his di&s;cour|&s;es. His manner is more like a rigid Philo&s;opher, than an eloquent orator. He is often dry, and &s;ometimes ob&s;cure. Nor would it do him wrong, &s;hould it be &s;aid, that he was not without defect as to his religious &s;entiments. His notion of the "millenium" was too gro&s;s and carnal. His conceit, "that &s;ome of the &s;inning angels had too free communication with women; begetting Daemons, and intro|ducing by this means, all kind of wick|edne&s;s among men," is quite extravagant. He may be thought to have le&s;&s;ened the

This no meer man ever yet did; for which rea|&s;on, whoever are &s;aved, mu&s;t be &s;aved upon the foot of grace through Chri&s;t: and in this way, why &s;hould it be thought incredible, that &s;ome among the heathen may have been &s;aved; though they knew not the plan upon which they ob|tained mercy?</P>

<P>APOL. ib. p. 97. "And upon Sunday, all tho&s;e who live in cities and country-towns or villages belonging to them, meet together, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The author of "an original draught of the primitive church," in an&s;wer to the author of the "enquiry into its con&s;titution," takes notice of this pa&s;&s;age as quoted ONLY in p. 17 of the "enquiry;" where the words are, "on Sunday all a&s;&s;emble together in the &s;ame place," leaving out, "throughout cities and countries:" upon which, the writer of the "draught" triumphantly &s;ays, p. 44, "Why do we think he left out the&s;e words, which were in the middle of the &s;entence? Why? Be|cau&s;e tho&s;e words of the holy Martyr would undeniably &s;hew it to be a general account of Chri&s;tian practice, in all places of the Chri&s;tian world; whereas our enquirer's bu&s;ine&s;s was to make it a particular in&s;tance of a &s;ingle Bi&s;hop's dioce&s;s, and that all the members of it, both "in city and country," met in one and the &s;ame place toge|ther at once; and if it were &s;o, then "cities and countries," in the plural number, would be too much for him: for if they proved any thing in that &s;en&s;e, they would prove that "cities and countries," indefinitely taken, wherever there were any Chri&s;tians in them, met all together every Sunday, and made but one congrega|tion." But if this remarker had turned his readers, as he would have done, had he acted a fair part, to p. 42 of the "enquiry," he would at once have made it glaringly evident, that the an&s;wer he has here given was nothing to the purpo&s;e. For the pa&s;&s;age in Ju&s;tin is here in|&s;erted to the full, both in the original Greek, and an Engli&s;h tran&s;lation. The words, as quoted in Greek, are the&s;e, "TEE TOU EELIOULEGOMINEE EE|MERA, PANT&Ocirc;N KATA POLEIS EE AGROUS ME|NONT&Ocirc;N EPI TO AUTO SUNELEUSIS GINETAI;" the very words quoted, by our remarker, in correction of p. 17 of the "enquiry." And the Engli&s;h tran&s;la|tion of the&s;e words, in this 42d p. of the "enquiry," is the &s;ame with that the remarker him&s;elf has given of them, only in&s;tead of "cities and countries," the "en|quiry" has it, "in city and country." But who does not at once &s;ee, that, conformably to the &s;entiment of Ju&s;tin, it is perfectly indifferent, whether his words are tran&s;lated "cities and countries," or "city and country?" The word AGROS may properly be taken to &s;ignify that part of a COUNTRY which is adjacent to &s;ome CITY, who&s;e towns or villages belong to it. The "enquiry" might under&s;tand the word in this &s;en&s;e; &s;uppo&s;ing that Ju&s;tin's meaning was, that all the Chri&s;tians, whether they lived in a city, or &s;ome village in the country near to it, and a territo|ry of it, a&s;&s;embled together every Sunday. And in this &s;en&s;e of the word, AGROS, it is preci&s;ely the &s;ame thing, whether the tran&s;lation be, "in cities and coun|tries," or "in the city and country." And the &s;ame may be &s;aid, &s;hould we &s;uppo&s;e, with our remarker, that the thought Ju&s;tin intended to communicate, was&punc; that all the Chri&s;tians in the Roman empire, or el&s;ewhere, throughout the world, "in cities or countries, a&s;&s;embled together on Sunday; for he mu&s;t mean, not in ONE BODY, but in DISTINCT CONGREGATIONS. And if they thus a&s;&s;embled, it mu&s;t be EPI TO AUTO, "in the &s;ame place," that is, not the whole complex body, but each part of which that body did con&s;i&s;t. This, without doubt, was the meaning of Ju&s;tin, and of the author of the "enquiry," in the words he has quoted from him. And, in this view of them, they are a clear and &s;trong proof of what they were introduced to make evident; which was, that, in Ju&s;tin's day, according to his account, the Bi&s;hop's charge was a &s;ingle congregation of Chri&s;tians, who u&s;ually a&s;&s;embled together on Sunday, or met in the &s;ame place, for the performance of tho&s;e religious &s;ervices he particularly relates. And they are as expre&s;s and full to the purpo&s;e, as could be de&s;ired; e&s;pecially if it be remembered, that the&s;e religious a&s;|&s;emblies are directly &s;poken of by Ju&s;tin, as having each of them their Prae&s;es, Bi&s;hop, Pa&s;tor, Prime-Pre&s;byter, or whatever other name any may plea&s;e to give him; who, when the Chri&s;tians were thus together in their &s;everal places of wor&s;hip, preached to them, admini&s;tered the &s;acraments, and did whatever el&s;e was proper to his office, at &s;uch times. This is certainly Ju&s;tin's repre&s;en|tation of the matter, unle&s;s "ALL the Chri&s;tians, throughout cities and countries," met together EVERY SUNDAY, in ONE GENERAL BODY; which our re|marker ju&s;tly &s;ays is "too much" to be his meaning: nor could it po&s;&s;ibly be the truth of fact. And it is mo&s;t obviou&s;ly remarkable, not a word is &s;aid, or di&s;tantly hinted, as if there was any officer in the Chri&s;tian church &s;uperior to the&s;e Pre&s;idents, or that any of them acted under him, as placed at their head; which mu&s;t be deemed an unpardonable omi&s;&s;ion in Ju&s;tin, if there had been, in his day, &s;uch an eccle&s;ia&s;tical officer: e&s;pecially if it be con&s;idered, that he was now writing to the "Em|peror, the &s;enate, and the whole body of the Roman peo|ple," on purpo&s;e to give them a fair and impartial ac|count of the nature, de&s;ign, and tendency of the meeting together of Chri&s;tians, with tho&s;e who had the &s;uperin|tendency of their religious affairs.</NOTE> and the writings of the

<P>ONE can &s;carce read the foregoing pa&s;&s;ages, and not take notice of the un|adulterated manner in which go&s;pel-ordi|nances are repre&s;ented to have been <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> mini&s;tered in that day. Nothing is &s;aid of tho&s;e ceremonies and &s;uper&s;titious ad|ditions, which, in after times, were brought in, and ob&s;erved, to the di&s;honor of God, the di&s;turbance of the church, and de|&s;poiling the ordinances them&s;elves of their native purity and &s;implicity, in which they appeared with a glory infinitely &s;uperior to that, which men have vainly endea|vored, by mixtures of their own invention, to put upon them. The&s;e, in truth, have deformed, not adorned them.&mdash;But to come nearer to the point in hand.</P>
<P><PB N="354" REF="012009_0363_0F894262F211A850">IT will obviou&s;ly be perceived, by a cur&s;ory reading only, that no evidence can be collected, from the&s;e te&s;timonies, in favor of the FACT pleaded for by Epi&s;|copalians. Not &s;o much as the word, Bi&s;hop, is to be found in them.&mdash;Not a &s;yllable is li&s;ped, importing a threefold order of officers in the church, Bi&s;hops, Pre&s;byters, and Deacons.&mdash;No in&s;inua|tion is given, not &s;o much as indirectly or implicitly, that Bi&s;hops were officers &s;uperior in their order to Pre&s;byters.&mdash; In &s;hort, &s;o far is ORDINATION, or CON|FIRMATION, from being appropriated to Bi&s;hops as their exclu&s;ive right, that not the lea&s;t hint is &s;ugge&s;ted about the one, or the other. And this is the more worthy of notice, as a very particular ac|count is exhibited of the ob&s;ervation of the Lord's day, of the admini&s;tration of bapti&s;m and the Lord's &s;upper, and of their being admini&s;tered by the PRESI|DENTS OF THE BRETHREN. Surely, Ju&s;tin would not have omitted to &s;peak of &s;o important a matter as the office and di&s;tingui&s;hing powers of Bi&s;hops, if he had thought of them as &s;ome Epi&s;copa|lians do at this day. He had as fair an opportunity to mention the&s;e things, as
<PB N="355" REF="012009_0364_0F894263AF476C90">
the other; yea, if Bi&s;hops, in his day, had been tho&s;e e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary offi|cers in the church, that they are made to be in this, he might with as much, nay, with much more, rea&s;on have brought them into view. He certainly did not know of &s;uch Bi&s;hops as are now con|tended for. Had there been any of this kind, in his day, it was altogether inex|cu&s;able in him, while pleading the cau&s;e of Chri&s;tians, to let it &s;uffer, by &s;aying nothing of that, which is now thought to en|ter into the very being of Chri&s;tianity it&s;elf.</P>
<P>IT may be pertinently added to what has been &s;aid, that the PRAESES, PRAE|POSITUS, or, in Engli&s;h, PRESIDENT of the brethren, was nothing more than the Pa&s;tor of a SINGLE flock, or congregation. For he is de&s;cribed as "leading in the pray|ers of a whole church, preaching to them, admini&s;tring the Lord's &s;upper, and &s;end|ing the con&s;ecrated elements to tho&s;e who could not be pre&s;ent at the time of ad|mini&s;tration." And it is remarkable, not a word is &s;aid of his being placed over Pre&s;byters as their ruler and Governor. In&s;tead of this, he is called the PRESI|DENT OF THE BRETHREN. And Pre&s;i|dents and Deacons are the TWO ORDERS
<PB N="356" REF="012009_0365_0F8942655752A078">
in the church he particularly &s;pecifies; meaning by Pre&s;idents, tho&s;e officers that were, in this age, promi&s;cuou&s;ly called either Bi&s;hops, or Pre&s;byters: or, at mo&s;t he could intend nothing more than <HI>Prime-Pre&s;byters,</HI> di&s;tingui&s;hing them as &s;uch by the application of this name to them. Mo&s;t certainly, he could not mean Bi|&s;hops in the impleaded &s;en&s;e; for then there would be only Bi&s;hops and Deacons in the church: neither could he mean Pre&s;byters in di&s;tinction from Bi&s;hops; for, in this view, there would be no Bi|&s;hops. The plain truth is, Ju&s;tin knew of but TWO INSTITUTED ORDERS of church-officers, the fir&s;t of which he calls PRESIDENTS, meaning hereby tho&s;e officers that were then called both Bi|&s;hops and Pre&s;byters; the other, DEA|CONS. And herein he agrees, not only with the apo&s;tolical writers, but with all his predece&s;&s;ors to the day in which he lived, who mention only TWO ORDERS of officers in the church; the fir&s;t of which they promi&s;cuou&s;ly call either Bi|&s;hops or Pre&s;byters, &s;ometimes the for|mer, and &s;ometimes the latter.</P>

<P>THE above named Fathers were all writers. I have, with Du-pin, placed them after Ju&s;tin, and before Ire|naeus, and in the &s;ame order; which, perhaps, is as exact as any they could be put in. There was no real need of bring|ing the&s;e writers to view; as the works of mo&s;t of them are lo&s;t, and tho&s;e of the other have nothing that falls in with our pre&s;ent de&s;ign: but it was thought be&s;t not to pa&s;s them over, without &s;aying what might be proper to give the reader a ju&s;t idea both of them, and of their writings.</P>
<P><PB N="358" REF="012009_0367_0F894266AB42F380">MELITO. He was Bi&s;hop of Sardis, in A&s;ia, and &s;ome &s;uppo&s;e him to have been the "Angel of the church" there, to whom one of the epi&s;tles in the "apo|calyp&s;e" is directed; but without the lea&s;t probability of truth. He flouri&s;hed, ac|cording to Dr. Cave, about the year 170. Du-pin brings him down a few years lower. Eu&s;ebius introduces Polycrates &s;peaking of him in that &s;tile, "Melito the Eunuch." It is generally &s;aid, he is thus &s;poken of on account of his extra|ordinary cha&s;te and &s;elf-denying life in celibacy, for religion's &s;ake. But no good rea&s;on has yet been given, &s;o far as I have &s;een, why the literal meaning of the word &s;hould be departed from. Jerom tells us, from one of Terrullian's works, "that he was e&s;teemed a Prophet by many of the people," that is, a man in&s;pired by the Holy Gho&s;t. He al&s;o informs us, from the &s;ame writer, that his "genius was eloquent and oratorical." He him&s;elf, as Eu&s;ebius writes in a quotation from him, tells us, "that he had travelled into the ea&s;t, and had compiled in order the books of the old te&s;tament, as they were then and there received:" upon which, he <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> "we have wrote &s;ix books of

Another "of the incorporeal God," or, as others tran&s;late the original words, "of God incarnate." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Lardner has not tran&s;lated the title of this book, be|cau&s;e, &s;ays he, "the meaning of it is doubtful." Says Du-pin, "It is expre&s;&s;ed in Greek, PERI ENS&Ocirc;MA|TOU THEOU, "of God incarnate," or "inve&s;ted with a body." Others expound this pa&s;&s;age after another manner, &s;uppo&s;ing, that he maintained that God was "corporeal." This la&s;t is not the proper &s;ignification of the Greek word.

But Til|lemont places it in 175; Ba&s;nage in 177, which latter date Dr. Lardner thinks comes neare&s;t the truth.</P>
<P>How long this celebrated Father lived, and in what manner he died, cannot be &s;aid at this day. Thus much only we

find, that Polycrates, in his "epi&s;tle to the church of Rome," &s;peaks of him, as "buried in Sardis, waiting for a vi&s;ita|tion from Heaven, when our Lord &s;hall rai&s;e him from the dead." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eu&s;eb. H. E. Lib. v. cap. 24.</NOTE></P>
<P>TATIAN. He was born in A&s;&s;yria, where he was in&s;tructed in the theology of the Grecians. The time of his con|ver&s;ion to the Chri&s;tian faith is uncertain; but it was effected, at lea&s;t in part, by reading the &s;acred books, and by con&s;ider|ing the corruptions and ab&s;urdities of Pagani&s;m. Of the&s;e things, he has in|formed us him&s;elf in his "di&s;cour&s;e again&s;t the Gentiles," the only one, among the many he wrote, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eu&s;ebius &s;ays, "He left to po&s;terity in writing a great number of commentaries." Jerom, in his book of il|lu&s;trious men, expre&s;&s;es it thus, "He left an infinite number of books."</NOTE> that is &s;till remaining. He is &s;uppo&s;ed to have publi&s;hed it be|fore he left the catholic opinions; Dr. Lardner thinks, between 165 and 173. He appears, from this performance, to have been a diligent &s;tudent in prophane learning. It is indeed filled with it; though the matters he treats of are not
<PB N="362" REF="012009_0371_0F894269ABF40788">
methodi&s;ed in the nice&s;t manner. Eu|&s;ebius calls this work "an elaborate one;" and &s;ays, "it is the mo&s;t elegant and u&s;e|ful of all his writings." He was Ju&s;tin's di&s;ciple, and lived in communion with the church during his life; but afterwards he embraced a variety of very ab&s;urd no|tions, and became the founder of a new &s;ect, called "Encratites," or "Continents." He condemned the u&s;e of wine, and diver&s;e &s;orts of fle&s;h, denied the lawfulne&s;s of marriage, the &s;alvation of Adam, and, what is much wor&s;e, the reality of Chri&s;t's &s;ufferings: be&s;ides all which, he main|tained the doctrine of Valentinus's "in|vi&s;ible aeons," and a&s;&s;erted, with Marcion, that there are "two Gods." Eu&s;ebius &s;peaks <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">H. E. Lib. iv. cap. 29.</NOTE> of his having "patched toge|ther, a kind of harmony and collection of the go&s;pels, which he called "dia te&s;&s;aron, of the four;" which, &s;ays he, "is &s;till in the hands of &s;ome." Theo|doret, a writer in the fifth century, &s;peak|ing of this &s;ame book, &s;ays, as I find him quoted by Dr. Lardner, he, mean|ing Tatian,
<Q>compo&s;ed a go&s;pel, which is called "dia te&s;&s;aron, of the four,"
<PB N="363" REF="012009_0372_0F89426A6C6DAC28">
leaving out the genealogies, and every thing that &s;hews the Lord to have been the &s;eed of David according to the fle&s;h; which has been u&s;ed, not only by tho&s;e of his &s;ect, but al&s;o by them who followed the apo&s;tolical doctrine, not perceiving the fraud of the com|po&s;ition, but &s;imply u&s;ing it as a com|pendious book. I have met with more then two hundred of the&s;e books, which were in e&s;teem in our churches; all which I took away and laid a&s;ide in a parcel, and placed in their room the go&s;pels of the four Evangeli&s;ts.</Q>
It was a report, in Eu&s;ebius's day, that this Tatian had the "a&s;&s;urance to alter the words of the Apo&s;tle [meaning without doubt the Apo&s;tle Paul,] pretending to mend the compo&s;ition, or order of his &s;tile." Dr. Mills &s;eems to think, this "altering the words of the Apo&s;tle" was nothing more than &s;ome interlineary or marginal explanations; and that the "correcting the Apo&s;tle's &s;tile" was on|ly di&s;po&s;ing his words, in the margin, in a more natural order, without doing, or intending to do, any prejudice to the ori|ginal text. This is as candid an account as can be given of this matter; but it
<PB N="364" REF="012009_0373_0F89426B2C6CF490">
does not well agree with the character of Tatian, who&s;e defection Eu&s;ebius <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">H. E. Lib. iv. cap. 29&punc;</NOTE> a&s;cribes to his being "&s;o puffed up with a pre|&s;umptuous &s;elf-e&s;timation, as to imagine he &s;urpa&s;&s;ed all others." Be&s;ides, having mentioned Severus, and his followers, called Severiani, and &s;aid, "they revile the Apo&s;tle Paul, reject his epi&s;tles, deny the acts of the Apo&s;tles;" he adds, "their fir&s;t author was Tatianus." How he died, is not known. Du-pin &s;ays, it was about the time that Irenaeus wrote his volume again&s;t here&s;ies; which, perhaps, is not far di&s;tant from the exact truth. Nothing is to be met with in this writer relative to the &s;ubject we are upon: or if there was, its credit would be much wea|kened, as, in&s;tead of "holding fa&s;t the truth," he had "turned a&s;ide to fables."</P>
<P>ATHENAGORAS. Two pieces of his are extant, "an apology for the Chri&s;ti|ans," and a "di&s;cour&s;e on the re&s;urrecti|on." In the former of the&s;e, he &s;peaks of him&s;elf as an "Athenian," and a "Philo&s;opher." And this is the mo&s;t we certainly know of him, except what
<PB N="365" REF="012009_0374_0F89426BEC51CB70">
may be collected from his writings. Eu|&s;ebius and Jerom &s;ay nothing of him, or of any work of his; nor is he mentioned by any of the ancients, until we have got down to Epiphanius, who has quoted a pa&s;&s;age from him. There is indeed &s;ome account of him by Philip Sidetes (a writer in the fifth century) in a fragment of his "Chri&s;tian hi&s;tory," publi&s;hed by Dodwel. But the learned in the&s;e matters do not give much credit to it. Says Dr. Lardner, "this hi&s;tory of Philip has no great character given it by Socrates, or Photius, who had read it."</P>
<P>THE "apology" is in&s;cribed to "Mar|cus Aurelius Antoninus, and Lucius Au|relius Commodus." Critical writers differ in their judgments as to one of the per|&s;ons, to whom this apology is addre&s;&s;ed, and accordingly put a different date to it. Some think it was addre&s;&s;ed to Marcus Antoninus, and his adopted brother and colleague in the empire, Lucius Verus, who died in 169, before which time this apology mu&s;t have been wrote. Others think it was in&s;cribed to Marcus Anto|ninus, and his &s;on Commodus. Tho&s;e of this latter opinion place it about the
<PB N="366" REF="012009_0375_0F89426CAE2AE0D0">
year 177 or 178. In this apology he wipes off the a&s;per&s;ions that had been ma|liciou&s;ly thrown on Chri&s;tians; affirm|ing, and de&s;cribing, their holine&s;s in all manner of conver&s;ation.&mdash;He a&s;&s;erts that the devils were ruined through love to women.&mdash;He admits free-will in its utmo&s;t latitude.&mdash;He commends virgi|nity, but condemns &s;econd marriages, calling them "hone&s;t adultery."&mdash;He treats of the re&s;urrection, and the la&s;t judg|ment.</P>
<P>HIS di&s;cour&s;e of the "re&s;urrection" was probably wrote after the apology; and what &s;trengthens the probability is, that, having towards the conclu&s;ion of the apology fallen upon the affair of the re|&s;urrection, he po&s;tpones a more full di&s;|cour&s;e upon it to &s;ome other time. He endeavors to prove, in this work, that a re&s;urrection from the dead, far from being impo&s;&s;ible, is extremely credible. His ar|guments are taken rather from rea&s;on than the &s;criptures.</P>
<P>THE genuinene&s;s of neither of the&s;e pieces are called in que&s;tion, though the author of them had &s;o little notice taken
<PB N="367" REF="012009_0376_0F89426D6A555B48">
of him in primitive antiquity. Dr. Lard|ner &s;ays, "He is a polite writer, and wrote in attic Greek; but he has rendered his &s;tile le&s;s agreeable by frequent parenthe&s;es."</P>
<P>HERMIAS. He is called "a Chri&s;tian Philo&s;opher," and wrote a piece, entitled, "Irri&s;io," an imperfect copy of which is &s;till remaining. It contains a &s;eries of &s;atyrical reflections on the wild opinions, and extravagant notions, of the philo|&s;ophycal Gentiles. Neither this work, or its author, are mentioned by any of the primitive Fathers; nor can it be deter|mined when he wrote it. However, &s;ays Du-pin "It is not to be doubted but that he is ancient, and that he lived before the pagan religion was extirpated." He adds, "This little book was printed by it&s;elf, in Greek and Latin, at Ba&s;il, anno domi|ni, 1553."</P>
<P>THEOPHILUS. He was born of hea|then parents, and was him&s;elf an heathen in religion, until his conver&s;ion to Chri&s;|tianity. When this was effected, or by what &s;pecial means, we know not; but, having profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf a Chri&s;tian, he &s;o adorned his character, in this view of
<PB N="368" REF="012009_0377_0F89426F0FE09340">
it, as to be thought worthy of the Epi&s;|copate at Antioch, in which he &s;ucceeded Eros, in the 8th of Marcus Antoninus, or 168th of our Lord.</P>
<P>HE did not confine him&s;elf to the work of preaching to the people of his particular charge, but endeavored by writ|ing al&s;o to &s;erve the common cau&s;e of Chri&s;tianity. He wrote, as the account is in Eu&s;ebius, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">H. E. Lib. iv. cap. 24.</NOTE> "three books to Auto|lycus, containing the elements of reli|gion;" another "again&s;t the here&s;y of Hermogenes;" another "again&s;t Mar|cion." There are al&s;o, &s;ays he, "other books of his concerning the rudiments of religion." Jerom, in his book of illu&s;trious men, be&s;ides mentioning the above writ|ings, &s;ays, "I have read &s;ome commen|taries upon the go&s;pel, and proverbs of Solomon, which go under his name; but they do not appear to me to an&s;wer the &s;tile and elegance of the beforementioned writings." There are &s;till extant, "&s;hort commentaries or allegories upon the four go&s;pels, in four books," with the name of Theophilus to them. Some have thought they were his; but without good rea&s;on.
<PB N="369" REF="012009_0378_0F89426FAB0B3210">
It is generally conceded, that they are the work of a much later writer. If the&s;e were the "commentaries" Jerom &s;aw, he ob&s;erved their difference in &s;tile and elogance from the other works of Theophilus; for which rea&s;on, it may be &s;uppo&s;ed, he was not the author of them; e&s;pecially, as they were unknown to Eu&s;ebius.

<P>THE fir&s;t of the&s;e books may not im|properly be called a di&s;cour&s;e between him and Autolycus, in an&s;wer to the de|&s;ire of that heathen Philo&s;opher, in which he treats of the nature of God, and what we call his attributes or perfections. The &s;econd book is wrote with a more im|mediate de&s;ign to convince Autolycus of the fal&s;hood of heatheni&s;m, and the truth of Chri&s;tianity. And here he mentions the opinions of the heathen concerning their gods, repre&s;enting their ab&s;urdity, and pointing out the contradictions there were among their Philo&s;ophers and Poets

upon this head. He enlarges upon the creation of the world; the hi&s;tory of Mo&s;es, which he &s;hews to be the olde&s;t and true&s;t of any in the world, and that they had extracted many things from the holy &s;criptures. In the third book, after having proved the writings of the hea|then to be contrary to good &s;en&s;e, and good manners, he vindicates the Chri&s;tians, by &s;etting their character in a fair and amiable light.

<Q>It is apparent from this little epitome, how well this author was acquainted with prophane hi&s;tory.

The third, to the "Nicomedians;" wherein he oppo&s;es the here&s;y of Marcion, com|paring it with the &s;tandard of faith. The fourth, to "the church of Gortyna, and

<HEAD TYPE="sub">His character, writings, te&s;timonies from them, and remarks.</HEAD>
<P>THE per&s;ons from whom Irenaeus de&s;cended are now unknown; and &s;o is the particular place where he was born. He might probably be a Greek, and of the country of A&s;ia. It is the con|jecture of &s;ome, that he was a native of Smyrna, or of &s;ome not far di&s;tant town, from his early acquaintance with the ve|nerable Polycarp. He was certainly, in his younger years, an attendant on the in|&s;tructions of this apo&s;tolical Father, who&s;e doctrine was &s;o deeply impre&s;&s;ed on his mind, that he firmly retained, even to old age, the remembrance of it. Thus much he has told us him&s;elf, in his
<PB N="380" REF="012009_0389_0F894277EAF7ADF8">
epi&s;tle to Florinus, quoted by Eu&s;ebius. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">H. E. Lib. v. cap. 20.</NOTE>
Says he,
<Q>I well remember the place where Polycarp &s;et when he taught; his going out, and coming in; his man|ner and cour&s;e of life; the figure and proportion of his body; the &s;ermons which he preached to the multitude; the relations he gave of his conver&s;e with the Apo&s;tle John, and others who &s;aw the Lord: how he remembered their &s;ayings, and what he heard from their mouths, touching the Lord, of his power and doctrine; reciting precepts, and all things con&s;onant to holy &s;crip|ture, out of their mouths (I &s;ay) who had &s;een with their eyes the word of life in the fle&s;h. The&s;e things, at that time, I diligently marked, and painted, not in paper, but in my heart; which continually, through the grace of God, I ponder and meditate.</Q>
&mdash;This mani|fe&s;ts his antiquity; which further appears from that frequent mode of diction, in his book again&s;t here&s;ies, "as I heard from a certain Pre&s;byter, who heard from tho&s;e who &s;aw the Apo&s;tles." Eu&s;ebius takes particular notice of this. Says he, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">H. E. Lib. v. cap. 8.</NOTE> "Irenaeus has mentioned the &s;ayings of
<PB N="381" REF="012009_0390_0F8942798F7A3FF0">
a certain apo&s;tolical Pre&s;byter without telling his name, and puts down his ex|po&s;itions of the &s;criptures." Who this Pre&s;|byter was cannot be a&s;certained. It might be Papias, whom he had &s;een, and heard, and has &s;ometimes pointed out by name. It might be Pothinus, his predece&s;&s;or, or &s;ome other ancient Father. He may from hence be ju&s;tly &s;tiled a man, if not of apo&s;tolical times, yet near to them; as having conver&s;ed with tho&s;e who had &s;een the Apo&s;tles, and were &s;ucce&s;&s;ors to them. When he took upon him the profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity is not known; though it is probable, he way indoctrinated in its principles from his earlie&s;t days, and not made a convert to them from the ido|latries and &s;uper&s;titions of Pagani&s;m.</P>
<P>THE time of his going to France can|not exactly be fixed; nor is the &s;pecial oc|ca&s;ion that led them there now known. But he &s;oon became famous in that part of the world, and did much &s;ervice for the intere&s;t of Chri&s;t, particularly in the church at Lyons. Pothinus, the Bi&s;hop, or Prae&s;es of this church, in the per&s;ecu|tion under Antoninus Verus, which now greatly raged in France, was brought
<PB N="382" REF="012009_0391_0F89427A2B00CDE8">
before the civil tribunal for his adherence to the cau&s;e of Chri&s;t, and, after a mo&s;t barbarous beating, was thrown into pri|&s;on almo&s;t breathle&s;s, and in about two days died there in the 90th year of his age. Irenaeus was thought the mo&s;t pro|per per&s;on to &s;ucceed the aged Martyr, and was accordingly cho&s;en by the church of Lyons their Bi&s;hop in his room, or, in other words, their Prime-Pre&s;byter.</P>
<P>THE &s;tate of their religious affairs was now unhappily difficult, not only on ac|count of that heavy per&s;ecution which was &s;carcely blown over, but al&s;o through the bu&s;y endeavors of &s;ome cunning deceivers to corrupt the pure doctrine of Chri&s;t embraced among them. The Valentinian heretics had by this time &s;pread them&s;elves as far as France, and bewitched, among others, a number of eminent women, with their wild and extravagant opinions. One Marcus was particularly a deceiver and abu&s;er of the weaker &s;ex. Upon this occa&s;ion, Irenaeus, as became a pious faithful Mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t, diligently labored to put a &s;top to the further &s;pread|ing of this contagion, and to recover tho&s;e who had been infected. And having,
<PB N="383" REF="012009_0392_0F89427AEB46ACA0">
under the favor of Heaven, &s;ecured his own charge, he was greatly &s;erviceable to other churches, as occa&s;ions therefor were offered in Providence. The church at Rome, being in danger of being led a&s;ide by two of her Pre&s;byters, Florinus and Bla&s;tus, he wrote to both the&s;e perverters of the truth, with great propriety and &s;trength; as we have the account from Eu&s;ebius. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">H. E. Lib. v. cap. 23.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE A&s;ian churches likewi&s;e were much troubled with the prophecies and delu&s;ians of Montanus, Alcibiades, and Theodotus: upon which the Gallican churches, either of their own accord, from chri&s;tian love and &s;ympathy, or at the reque&s;t of their A&s;ian brethren, &s;ent Irenaeus to them with their letters, that he might comfort them under their trial, confirm them in the truth, and a&s;&s;i&s;t them in the confutation of the&s;e heretics, who had ro&s;e up among them.</P>
<P>IN his time al&s;o, the controver&s;y about the circum&s;tances of keeping ea&s;ter was unhappily revived by Victor, Bi&s;hop of
<PB N="384" REF="012009_0393_0F89427BAC4E73F8">
Rome, a furious hot headed bigot, and increa&s;ed to an heighth that was like to bring confu&s;ion to the churches. Ire|naeus, not unaffected with the unchri&s;|tian heats and animo&s;ities that were now too prevalent, thought it his duty to en|deavour to promote love and peace be|tween the contending parties, notwith|&s;tanding their difference in &s;entiment upon this point. He accordingly wrote, in the name of the brethren in France, with great pertinence, to Victor of Rome. A large fragment of this letter Eu&s;ebius has pre&s;erved, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">H. E. Lib. v. cap. 23.</NOTE> in which Ire|naeus &s;ays,
<Q>Though he him&s;elf &s;olemni|&s;ed the fea&s;t of ea&s;ter on the Lord's day, according to his [Victor's] manner, yet he could not approve of the bitter zeal he di&s;covered again&s;t others for the ob&s;ervation of a cu&s;tom after the man|ner they had received from their an|ce&s;tors.</Q>
He tells him,
<Q>that differ|ent cu&s;toms had been u&s;ed in churches, not only in the celebration of the fea&s;t of ea&s;ter, but al&s;o of fa&s;ts, and in diver&s;e other matters of practice.</Q>
And, in fine, he reminds him,
<Q>That his predece&s;&s;ors did not contend with the
<PB N="385" REF="012009_0394_0F89427C6C42F690">
A&s;iatics in this matter; and that Po|lycarp, being at Rome, and having conferred with Anicetus, upon this affair, they determined that mutual communion ought not to be broken for a matter of &s;o &s;mall importance; and that they communicated with each other.</Q>
He wrote, as Eu&s;ebius a&s;&s;ures us, many reconciling letters to other Bi&s;hops, upon this &s;ame head. And, it is probable, they were followed with &s;ome good effect. For though the A&s;ia|tics did not lay a&s;ide their cu&s;tom, it does not appear that the union betwixt them and the Romani&s;ts was broken; but a more calm and tranquil &s;tate of things took place. Thus this good man, in agreement with the purport of his name, di&s;covered him&s;elf to be of a peace|able, and peace-making temper. And he has, from that time to this, been cha|racteri&s;ed as one happily di&s;po&s;ed to pro|mote candor, love, and peace among brethren; though he could clothe him&s;elf with zeal, and appear &s;trenuous and re|&s;olute, when the purity of go&s;pel truth was in danger of being corrupted by the cunning arts of tho&s;e, who lay in wait to deceive.</P>

Theodoret &s;ays, he was "an apo&s;tolical man, admirable, and the light of the we&s;tern church." Epiphanius al&s;o is high in his encomium of him. His words are, "Old Irenaeus, every way

<P>IN the fir&s;t book, having largely de|&s;cribed the heretical tenets of the Valen|tinians, he oppo&s;es to them the faith of all the churches in the world, which he comprehends, in a creed, truly catholic and excellent. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This creed being &s;o unlike tho&s;e we met with in after ages, containing, not metaphy&s;ical niceties, but &s;uch go&s;pel doctrines only, as are nearly and clo&s;ely connected with &s;alvation, I &s;hall think it worth while to in&s;ert it here. "It is, (as Irenaeus's words are) to believe in one omni|potent God, who made heaven, and the earth, and the &s;eas, and all things that are in them; and in one Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the Son of God, incarnate for our &s;alvation; and in the Holy Gho&s;t, who by the Prophets, preached the my&s;te|ries of the di&s;pen&s;ation and coming of Chri&s;t, his birth of a virgin, his pa&s;&s;ion, re&s;urrection from the dead, a&s;&s;ump|tion in his fle&s;h into heaven, and his coming from heaven in the glory of the Father to re&s;tore [recapitulate, or gather into one] all things, and to rai&s;e the fle&s;h [the bodies] of all mankind, that unto Je&s;us our Lord, and God, and Savior, and King, according to the good plea&s;ure of the Father, every knee &s;hould bow, both of things in heaven, and in the earth, and under the earth, and that every tongue &s;hould confe&s;s to him, and that he &s;hould pa&s;s a righteous &s;entence upon all, and &s;end &s;piritual wickedne&s;&s;es, the angels that fell and become apo&s;tate, and al&s;o ungodly, unrighteous, lawle&s;s, and bla&s;phemous men into eternal fire; but that, for the righteous and holy, and &s;uch as did keep his commandments, and abode in his love, &s;ome from the beginning, and &s;ome by repentance, he might, grati|fying them with life, be&s;tow on them incorruptibility, and eternal glory."</NOTE> He then goes on to

&s;hew, that all chri&s;tians agree in this faith; and that the mo&s;t learned can add no|thing to it, or make any changes in it, nor the mo&s;t &s;imple and ignorant dimin|i&s;h any part of it. He then largely ex|plains the ab&s;urd notions of Valentinus and his di&s;ciples; and, returning to the original of the heretics, and beginning with Simon Magus, he gives an account &s;ucce&s;&s;ively of all the here&s;ies that ap|peared &s;ince the time of that &s;orcerer, to the time wherein he wrote. This fir&s;t book is extremely dry, tedious, and ob|&s;cure; pre&s;enting us with &s;carce any thing but the wild conceits, and extra|vagantly ab&s;urd notions of the primitive heretics. In the &s;econd book, he makes u&s;e of the principles of the&s;e heretics to oppo&s;e their errors; &s;hewing that they contradict

them&s;elves, and that their notions were idle, ridiculous whim&s;ies. In the third book, he confutes them by the authority of the &s;acred writings, and tradition from tho&s;e who had &s;een and conver&s;ed with the Apo&s;tles. In the fourth book, he con|tinues to prove, that there is but one God; particularly, he &s;hews again&s;t Marcion, that the &s;ame God is exhibited in the old and new te&s;tament. He an&s;wers the objections of the heretics, e&s;pecially tho&s;e they fetch from &s;cripture. He then gives the rea&s;ons why a &s;piritual man, that is to &s;ay, a Chri&s;tian condemns Pagans, Jews, heretics and &s;ci&s;matics; and, finally, rejects the opinion of tho&s;e who affirmed, that men were naturally good or evil, and proves the liberty of mankind. In the la&s;t book, he treats of the fall of man, of the redemption by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, of the re&s;urrection of the dead, of the la&s;t judgment, of anti-chri&s;t, and of the &s;tate of &s;ouls after death.&mdash; The&s;e, in general, are the &s;ubjects en|larged on in the&s;e books.</P>

But it may be ju&s;tly que&s;tioned, whether his judgment was equal to his reading. The learned Photius &s;ays of him, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cod. 120.</NOTE> "That he had in &s;ome of his books, "&s;ophi&s;ti|cated the truth of eccle&s;ia&s;tical doctrines by &s;purious rea&s;onings." This is a real fact, and known to be &s;o, by all who are ac|quainted with his writings. His manner of arguing is &s;ometimes weak, not to &s;ay trifling. I am &s;ure, it would be thought to be &s;o in any one, who, at this day, &s;hould rea&s;on as he has done. However, he appears, after all, to have been a pious, learned, valuable man, who&s;e memory ought to be-ble&s;&s;ed for his laborious &s;ervices in the cau&s;e of truth. Many things are to be met with in his writings well worth our &s;pecial notice; though he &s;ometimes makes it appear, that he had his fail|ings and imperfections. Candor it&s;elf will not pretend, that he has not, in &s;ome in&s;tances, deviated from that unerring rule, the word of truth. He, with other writers, both before and after him, have built &s;ome hay and &s;tubble upon the foundation they held, which will not en|dure the trial of the fire.</P>
<P><PB N="397" REF="012009_0406_0F894044AE4BDE20">THE learned are not agreed as to the exact time, when Irenaeus wrote his "five books again&s;t here&s;ies."

Dr. Lardner &s;ays, "As to the time of his writing the&s;e "five books," it is the opi|nion of diver&s;e learned men, that they were not wrote, and publi&s;hed all toge|ther, but rather at &s;ome di&s;tance of time." And, though he does not attempt to &s;ettle preci&s;ely the year, in which this work was compleated, he places Irenaeus in the year 178; though he is inclined to think, his "books again&s;t here&s;ies" were not publi&s;hed quite &s;o &s;oon.</P>
<P>"HIS death, &s;ays Du-pin, was no le&s;s glorious than his life. For, after having governed the flock, which Je&s;us Chri&s;t had committed to his charge for 24 years, he fell a Martyr at Lyons, in the per&s;e|cution of the Emperor Severus, which was more cruel in France than in any other part of the world, anno Chri&s;ti 202, or 203." He has often been &s;poken of as a Martyr by other learned men. But, from the &s;ilence of Tertullian, Eu&s;ebius,
<PB N="398" REF="012009_0407_0F894045709F6728">
and other ancient Fathers concerning this matter, it is very ju&s;tly argued by Dr. Cave, Ba&s;nage, Dr. Lardner, and others, that there is no good rea&s;on to &s;ay he died a Martyr. The mo&s;t critical in|quirers into matters of this nature place his death, &s;ome in 190, and others in 191, or 192. Baronius <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ad.

<P>THE &s;econd, which is eminently per|tinent to the point in debate, is contain|ed in his "epi&s;tle to Victor" of Rome, which was extant in the days of Eu&s;e|bius, though it has long &s;ince been lo&s;t. The words are the&s;e, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eu&s;eb H. E.

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS and REMARKS upon the te&s;timonies from IRENAEUS.</HEAD>
<P>NOTHING is more obviou&s;ly evident, &s;o far as we regard the above pa&s;&s;ages, than that Irenaeus cannot be called in as a WITNESS, either to the CLAIM or EX|ERCISE of tho&s;e powers, which Epi&s;co|palians pretend are e&s;&s;ential to the office of Bi&s;hops. For he no where &s;ays, that it is the RIGHT of Bi&s;hops, in di&s;tinction from Pre&s;byters, to CONFER HOLY ORDERS; or that they were the per&s;ons, who did in FACT confer them, either in the age in which he lived, or any other: neither does
<PB N="410" REF="012009_0419_0F89404F2EAF9578">
he affirm, directly or indirectly, that it was any part of the work of Bi&s;hops, much le&s;s their appropriate di&s;criminate work, to GOVERN PRESBYTERS, or that they ever did &s;o. And, in&s;tead of declaring, that Bi&s;hops are officers in the church DISTINCT from, and SUPERIOR to, Pre&s;|byters, he &s;peaks of them, as clearly and fully as he could have done, in language nece&s;&s;arily leading us to look upon them as &s;u&s;taining the SAME OFFICE only in the church. No writer, &s;ince the apo&s;|tolic times, has more exactly, or frequent|ly, copied after the in&s;pired penmen, in the promi&s;cuous u&s;e of the words Bi&s;hops and Pre&s;byters. He u&s;es the&s;e words indifferently, and frequently, to point out the &s;ame officers in the church. And unle&s;s when he u&s;es the word, Bi&s;hops, he means the &s;ame church officers, as when he u&s;es the word, Pre&s;byters, there is nei|ther coherence, con&s;i&s;tency, or the lea&s;t force of argument, in mo&s;t of the pa&s;&s;a|ges, in which the&s;e words are mention|ed. As this is an important point in the pre&s;ent debate, I &s;hall enlarge in its illu&s;tration, and take occa&s;ion for it by an&s;wering what is pleaded, from Irenaeus, in favor of Epi&s;copacy.</P>
<P><PB N="411" REF="012009_0420_0F89404FEF99FD48">THE grand plea is, that he is pirticular in giving us the line of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; that he does it in &s;ingle per&s;ons; and that the&s;e per&s;ons are frequently and expre&s;&s;ly called Bi&s;hops: evidently importing a di&s;tinction of place, order, or office, be|tween them and Pre&s;byters.</P>
<P>THE an&s;wer is ea&s;y, and, as I imagine, &s;trongly conclu&s;ive. It is allowed, reck|oning the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion by &s;ingle per&s;ons in|timates &s;ome difference betwixt the nam|ed per&s;ons, and others of the &s;ame church, as the ground, or rea&s;on, of their being &s;ingled out.But what conceivable need is there, unle&s;s to &s;erve a turn, to &s;uppo&s;e, that the difference mu&s;t be &s;o great as to import an imparity of or|der, or office? Are there no in&s;tan|ces, in which it is certain, particular per&s;ons have been di&s;tingui&s;hed from their brethren of the &s;ame order, to an&s;wer the like end? Bi&s;hop Stillingfleet has told us of &s;ome admirably well adapted to the purpo&s;e. Says he, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Iren. p. 300.</NOTE>
<Q>At Athens, after they grew weary of their ten years <HI>Archontes,</HI> the people cho&s;e nine every
<PB N="412" REF="012009_0421_0F894050AE3A55D8">
year to govern the affairs of the com|mon-wealth. The&s;e nine enjoyed a parity of power among them&s;elves, and therefore had a place where they con&s;ulted together about the matters of &s;tate, which was called <HI>Stat&ecirc;gion,</HI> as Demo&s;thenes, Plutarch, and others tell us: now although they enjoyed this equality of power, yet one of them had greater dignity than the re&s;t, and therefore was called <HI>Arch&ocirc;n</HI> by way of excellency, and his name only was &s;et in the public records of that year, and therefore was called <HI>Arch&ocirc;n ep&ocirc;nu|mos</HI>; and the year was reckoned from him, as Pau&s;anias and Julius Pollux inform us. Here we &s;ee now the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion clear in one &s;ingle per&s;on, and yet no &s;uperiority of power in him over his colleagues. The like may be ob|&s;erved of the <HI>Ephori</HI> and <HI>bidiaei</HI> at Sparta. The number of the <HI>ephori</HI> was always five from their fir&s;t in&s;titution by Ly|curgus, and not nine, as the Greek etymologi&s;t imagines. The&s;e likewi&s;e enjoyed a parity of power; but among the&s;e, to give name to the year, they made choice of one who was called <HI>Ep&ocirc;numos</HI> here too, as the <HI>Arch&ocirc;n</HI> at
<PB N="413" REF="012009_0422_0F8940516FB31710">
Athens; and him they called <HI>Pre&s;t&ocirc;ta t&ocirc;n ephor&ocirc;n,</HI> as Plutarch tells: where we have the very name <HI>Proe&s;t&ocirc;s</HI> attributed to him that had only this primacy of order, without any &s;uperiority of power, which is u&s;ed by Ju&s;tin Martyr of the <HI>Pre&s;ident</HI> of a&s;&s;emblies among Chri&s;tians. Now from hence we may evidently &s;ee, that meer &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;ome &s;ingle per&s;ons named above the re&s;t, in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ions of apo&s;tolical churches, cannot enforce any &s;uperio|rity of power in the per&s;ons &s;o named, above others &s;uppo&s;ed to be joint go|vernors of the churches with them.</Q>
There was, we &s;ee, among the <HI>Archon|tes</HI> at Athens, and the <HI>Ephori</HI> at Sparta, a &s;enior in office, a chair-man, or pre&s;i|dent; and he was, for this rea&s;on, &s;ingled out, from his brethren of the &s;ame office-power, to give denomination to the year. The like may be &s;aid in the ca&s;e before us. Among the Pre&s;byters in each church, who all &s;u&s;tained the &s;ame office, and were ve&s;ted with the &s;ame e&s;&s;ential pow|ers, there might be a prae&s;es, Modera|tor, or prime-Pre&s;byter; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It may be worthy of &s;pecial notice here, Irenaeus him&s;elf very plainly intimates, that, among PRESBYTERS, or tho&s;e who were of that ORDER which con&s;tituted the PRESBYTERATE, there were &s;ome, in his day, who, "not having the fear of God in their hearts," but being "elated with the dignity of the FIRST or PRINCIPAL SESSION, contumeliou&s;ly treated the other Pre&s;byters." Vid. lib. iv. cap. 44.

He here &s;peaks of a PRINCIPAL SES|SION&punc; that is, one that belonged to the PRIME-PRES|BYTER, the HEAD or PRAESES of the PRESBYTERY.</NOTE> and he might,
<PB N="414" REF="012009_0423_0F8940522F98C8B0">
on this account, be &s;elected to have his name mentioned in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion: or his name might be in&s;erted, merely as being the &s;enior-Pre&s;byter, or becau&s;e he was be&s;t known, and mo&s;t celebrated for his learning, piety, and &s;trict attachment to the apo&s;tolic doctrine. This difference of character, without the &s;uppo&s;ition of any difference in point of office, or pow|er, will fully account for a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion as reckoned in a line of &s;ingle per&s;ons; and it is &s;ufficient, could nothing el&s;e be &s;aid, to render their arguing invalid, who, merely from hence, would conclude, that the&s;e particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed and named per&s;ons were of a &s;uperior, and di&s;tinct order, in the churches, from the Pre&s;by|ters belonging to them.</P>
<P>BUT, to give &s;trength to this argu|ment, it is further &s;aid, &s;ingle per&s;ons are
<PB N="415" REF="012009_0424_0F894052F37508E0">
not only named in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, but they are frequently and expre&s;&s;ly called Bi&s;hops. Very true; but then it is as true, that Irenaeas has taken all proper care, as though he had it in de&s;ign, to guard again&s;t any ones mi&s;taking his "&s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Bi&s;hops," for the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of a "&s;uperior order" in the church to that of Pre&s;byters. This is particularly worthy of notice. I &s;hall accordingly endeavor to &s;et it in the clear|e&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t point of light. And I know of no way in which I can better do this, than by placing a few of the forego|ing pa&s;&s;ages, upon the head of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, in two oppo&s;ite columns. It will then appear, at fir&s;t &s;ight, to every intelligent unprejudiced reader, that Irenaeus means, and, unle&s;s he is made to &s;peak non&s;en&s;e, mu&s;t mean by the "&s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Bi&s;hops," one and the &s;ame thing with the "&s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of Pre&s;byters," and vice-ver&s;a.</P>

mention of Bi&s;hops "as con&s;tituted in the churches by the Apo&s;tles?" He ex|pre&s;&s;es the &s;ame &s;entiment, when he &s;ays, "the Pre&s;byters in the church have &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion from the Apo&s;tles:" nor can we mi&s;take his meaning, if we only con&s;ider, that, in the immediately following words, he calls this very &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, "the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of the Epi&s;copate;" and, in ano|ther place, makes the remark, "&s;uch Pre&s;|byters the church nouri&s;heth;" and intro|duces the Prophet &s;aying, "I will give you Princes in peace, and Bi&s;hops in righteou&s;ne&s;s." In vain mu&s;t it be to look for a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Bi&s;hops, in Irenaeus's writings, di&s;tinct from Pre&s;byters, and ve&s;ted with &s;uperior powers, when he attributes not only "the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion," but "the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in Epi&s;copacy," to Pre&s;|byters; indifferently calling the &s;ingle per&s;ons he reckons in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, Bi|&s;hops and Pre&s;byters.

<P><PB N="421" REF="012009_0430_0F894058304A51E8">IT may be pertinently ob&s;erved yet fur|ther, the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion Irenaeus has in view, is not a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of POWER, but of DOC|TRINE. This will be obvious, at fir&s;t &s;ight, by looking over the foregoing quo|tations from him. His di&s;pute is with the heretics of that day; and the u&s;e he makes of the argument from &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is, to prove that they had departed from that DOCTRINE, which had been handed down, in the churches, even from the Apo&s;tles to that time. This is his grand point, and he keeps to it; never menti|oning the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, but in order to &s;hew, how, and from what original &s;ource, the DOCTRINE of Chri&s;t had come down, and been pre&s;erved in its purity to his day. To &s;eek therefore for a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of POWER, in Irenaeus, is to &s;eek for the living among the dead. He no where rea&s;ons from the &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion in the churches, in favor of any peculi|arity of power in Bi&s;hops beyond Pre&s;byters, but confines his argument SOLELY to the head of DOCTRINE. So that, it is impo&s;|&s;ible to make any valid u&s;e of what he has &s;aid upon &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, to prove a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of power; much le&s;s a &s;uperioriry of power, appropriated to Bi&s;hops in di&s;tinc|tion from Pre&s;byters. It mu&s;t be previ|ou&s;ly

laid down as a po&s;tulatum, or el&s;e &s;ufficiently made evident, that the apo&s;|tolic doctrine could not have been hand|ed down pure and incorrupt, but in a line of &s;uch Bi&s;hops as were of an order in the church &s;uperior to Pre&s;byters; or any argument from Irenaeus's &s;ucce&s;&s;ion will be e&s;&s;entially lame and defective. It will not be allowed, before it has been va|lidly proved, that Bi&s;hops, in the appro|priated &s;en&s;e, could be the only convey|ers of apo&s;tolic truth.

<P>IT may add weight to what has been &s;aid upon the&s;e te&s;timonies, if it be &s;ub|joined, that the Gallican churches, who &s;ent Irenaeus to Rome with an epi&s;tle to Eleutherius, Bi&s;hop of the church there, had no idea of that &s;uperiority of Bi&s;hops to Pre&s;byters, which is now &s;o much talk|ed of.

And this rea&s;oning will "appear &s;till more forcible, if it be added, that, in this very letter, he is mention|ed by the other Pre&s;byters, as their "bro|ther and colleague." So the words are in Eu&s;ebius, who has quoted them. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">H. E. Lib. iv. cap. 5.</NOTE> "Fa|ther Eleutherius! we wi&s;h you health in all things, and always in God.

<P>ONLY one plea more, that I know of, is fetched from Irenaeus in favor of the epi&s;copal cau&s;e. It is his u&s;ing that mode of &s;peech, "Bi&s;hops and Pre&s;byters;" which; &s;ay the prelati&s;ts, evidently imports a di&s;tinction of officers, and gives the &s;uperiority to Bi&s;hops.</P>
<P>IT is acknowledged, this mode of dic|tion is once u&s;ed by Irenaeus. But how
<PB N="425" REF="012009_0434_0F89405B2E4E2810">
does he u&s;e it? Not as his own, but the language rather of the Apo&s;tle Paul. The pa&s;&s;age, in which the words are to be found, runs thus: "He [Paul] applied him&s;elf to the Bi&s;hops and Pre&s;byters con|vened at Miletus, who were of Ephe&s;us, and the neighbouring towns, becau&s;e he was going to Jeru&s;alem."&mdash;The&s;e words, "Bi&s;hops and Pre&s;byters," which Ire|naeus has alluded to, or rather quoted from Acts xx, are u&s;ed &s;ynonimou&s;ly by the Apo&s;tle Paul. And of this there is no room for di&s;pute. For, it is expre&s;|ly declared, that, from Miletus, he &s;ent to Ephe&s;us, and called the Elders [<HI>Pre&s;|buterous</HI>] of the church. And in v. 28, in his exhortation to the&s;e very Elders, he as expre&s;&s;ly calls them [<HI>Epi&s;copous</HI>] Bi&s;hops. I would now a&s;k, is it not quite ea&s;y and natural to &s;uppo&s;e, that Irenaeus u&s;es the phra&s;e, "Bi&s;hops and Pre&s;byters," in allu&s;ion to the 17th and 28th ver&s;e of the ju&s;t mentioned xxth of Acts, in the former of which Paul u&s;es the word, "Pre&s;byters;" and in the latter, the word, "Bi&s;hops?" And as Paul mo&s;t certainly u&s;ed them &s;ynonimically; is it not rea&s;onable to think, that Irenaeus u&s;ed them in the like &s;en&s;e? E&s;pecially,
<PB N="426" REF="012009_0435_0F89405BEF5DC350">
as, in every other pa&s;&s;age through|out his writings, in&s;tead of connecting Bi&s;hops and Pre&s;byters, &s;o as that it might &s;eem as if he intended to make a di&s;tinc|tion between them, he has u&s;ed the words invariably in the &s;ynonimous &s;en&s;e, in|differently and promi&s;cuou&s;ly meaning by Bi&s;hops, Pre&s;byters; and by Pre&s;byters, Bi&s;hops.

<P>IT may, upon the whole, be &s;aid with real truth, not only that Irenaeus is a full and po&s;itive witne&s;s again&s;t the epi&s;|copal cau&s;e, but a po&s;itive and full one in favor of our's. He &s;ays not a word in evidence of tho&s;e POWERS that are made ESSENTIAL to the EPISCOPATE; but as much as we could de&s;ire, in proof of the SAMENESS of the ORDER, or OF|FICE, of Bi&s;hops and Pre&s;byters.</P>

<P>TITUS FLAVIUS CLEMENS, or CLE|MENT of ALEXANDRIA, the name by which he is more commonly di&s;tin|gui&s;hed, was probably of heatheni&s;h ex|tract; and &s;ome &s;ay, a native of Athens. Epiphanius tells us, "he was called by &s;ome Clement of Alexandria; by others Clement of Athens;" and &s;up|po&s;es from hence, "that Athens was the place of his birth; Alexandria, of his after re&s;idence, and con&s;tant employment." It is altogether uncertain, when he fir&s;t profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf a Chri&s;tian, and by what means he was induced to do &s;o. He flou|ri&s;hed, &s;ays Dr. Lardener, in the reign of Severus, and his &s;on Antoninus Cara|cella, that is, between 192 and 217. Du-pin
<PB N="434" REF="012009_0443_0F8940636E33ED38">
&s;ays, he reached the time of Helioga|bulus, and did not die before the year 220.</P>
<P>HE had early a &s;trong thir&s;t after know|ledge, and by diligent &s;tudy, under the advantage of valuable natural endow|ments, e&s;pecially a mo&s;t tenacious me|mory, and the be&s;t means of indoctrina|tion the world was favoured with in that day, he acquired the reputation of having attained to an extraordinary height in all &s;orts of learning. He was a &s;tudent un|der &s;everal ma&s;ters. As he him&s;elf tells us, in his fir&s;t book of &s;tromes, he had "two in Greece, the one a Caelo-Syrian, the other an Egyptian; two more in the ea&s;t, one an A&s;&s;yrian, the other of Pale&s;|tine: and that at la&s;t he found one in Egypt, who was far more excellent than all the re&s;t." This was Pantaenus, of whom he &s;peaks with great re&s;pect, and in his in&s;titutions expre&s;sly calls "his ma&s;|ter." The names of the fir&s;t four are not mentioned. Baronius thinks the A&s;&s;y|rian was Barde&s;anes, and he of Pale&s;tine Theophilus of Cae&s;aria. Vale&s;ius, with greater probability, &s;uppo&s;es Tatian to have been the A&s;&s;yrian, and Theodotus the Hebrew, under who&s;e name there is a "fragment" of the "in&s;titutions" at the end of the works of Clement.</P>
<P><PB N="435" REF="012009_0444_0F8940642F869C58">BUT though he &s;tudied under the&s;e &s;e|veral ma&s;ters, he did not implicitly &s;wallow their dictates, but cho&s;e, as it was fit he &s;hould do, to judge for him&s;elf. He ac|cordingly &s;ays, in the fir&s;t book of his &s;tromata, "I e&s;pou&s;ed not this, or that philo&s;ophy, neither the &s;toic, nor the pla|tonic, nor the epicurean, nor that of Ari&s;|totle; but whatever any of the&s;e &s;ects had &s;aid that was right and ju&s;t, all that, being &s;elected, I call philo&s;ophy." This not|with&s;tanding, as Dr. Cave ob&s;erves, "he came neare&s;t to the &s;toics, as appears from his di&s;cour&s;ing by way of paradoxes, and his affected novelty of words, two things peculiar to the men of that way. And I doubt not but he was peculiarly di&s;po&s;ed towards this &s;ect by the in&s;truc|tions of his ma&s;ter Pantaenus, &s;o great and profe&s;&s;ed an admirer of the &s;toical philo&s;ophy." This Pantaenus was ma&s;|ter of the &s;chool or academy at Alexan|dria, for the in&s;truction of <HI>catechumens,</HI> that is, new converts from heatheni&s;m, or the children of believers grown up to a capacity of indoctrination, e&s;pecially &s;uch of them as were intended for the &s;ervice of the church of Chri&s;t. The language and liberal arts, it is &s;aid, were taught here, as well as the grounds and
<PB N="436" REF="012009_0445_0F894064EE7EE888">
principles of the Chri&s;tian religion. Han|mer &s;ays, "Pantaenus read in Alexandria divinity and philo&s;ophy, from whence it is thought the orders of in&s;tituting uni|ver&s;ities fir&s;t began in Chri&s;tendom." Clement, it is probable, taught in this ca|techetical &s;chool with Pantaenus, and &s;up|plied his place while gone to preach the go&s;pel in India. It is certain, he &s;uc|ceeded him upon his death, in this office; and he continued in it a long time, to the end of his life; ever conducting with ho|nour to him&s;elf, and great advantage to tho&s;e who attended on his in&s;tructions. Some of the mo&s;t eminent men, in that age, were educated under his care; &s;uch as Origen, Alexander, afterwards Bi&s;hop of Jeru&s;alem, and many others. Not a great way from the beginning of Severus's reign, he &s;u&s;tained the office of a Pre&s;by|ter in the church of Alexandria, be&s;ides this of a catechi&s;t there; for in this cha|racter Eu&s;ebius &s;peaks of him in the year 195. And being a man of great piety, as well as learning, and eminently zealous to promote the honor of God, and the advancement of religion, he did much &s;ervice by his preaching, not only in Alexandria, but in Jeru&s;alem, and An|tioch, to which places he occa&s;ionally

were newly bapti&s;ed. An "eccle&s;ia&s;tical canon," or a di&s;cour&s;e "again&s;t jewdai&s;|ing." A di&s;cour&s;e "of the re&s;urrection." Another, "of continence." Another, "of marriage." The&s;e three he him&s;elf mentions in his &s;tromata; and particu|larly &s;peaks of the la&s;t, in his paedago|gus, lib. iii. cap. 8. where he gives a &s;um|mary of the contents of it. Trithemius <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De Scriptoribus.</NOTE> &s;ays, he wrote "many epi&s;tles." Eu&s;e|bius informs us, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">H. E. Lib. vi. cap. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> that he "promi&s;ed a commentary upon Gene&s;is." Whether he ever wrote it, is not now known. Be|&s;ides all the&s;e, Eu&s;ebius often mentions, and &s;ometimes quotes, a volume, called "hypotypo&s;es," or "eight books of in|&s;titutions." In this work, according to Photius, "he goes over the main body of the &s;criptures in a brief commentary, or expo&s;ition; not omitting &s;ome books that were generally rejected as apocryphal." This learned critic ob&s;erves further, in common with others, that, in this per|formance, there are "&s;ome things very er|ronious and fabulous. Du-pin &s;uppo&s;es this work mu&s;t needs have been compo&s;ed by St. Clement before he was thoroughly in&s;tructed in the Chri&s;tian religion, and had quitted the opinions of Plato; or
<PB N="439" REF="012009_0448_0F8940672E7EA620">
while he was half a Platoni&s;t, and half a Chri&s;tian. Dr. Cave rather falls in with the opinion of Photius, which was,
<Q>that probably the&s;e things were in&s;erted by another hand; as Ruffinus ex|pre&s;&s;ly a&s;&s;ures us, that here&s;ies had cor|rupted Clement his writings. Certain|ly, &s;ays he, had the&s;e books been infected with the&s;e prophane and poi&s;onous dog|mata in Eu&s;ebius's time, he would have given us, at lea&s;t, &s;ome ob&s;cure intimations of it. And con&s;iderable it is, that the&s;e things are not countenanced by his other books; nay, many of them are plainly contradicted by them.</Q></P>

<P>THE remaining, and commonly re|ceived, works of Clement, be&s;ides a &s;mall tract, more lately publi&s;hed, entitled,
<PB N="440" REF="012009_0449_0F894067EE4805C0">
"what rich man &s;hall be &s;aved?" are the&s;e three. His "exhortation to the Gentiles," in one book. His "paeda|gogue," or &s;chool-ma&s;ter, in three books. His "&s;tromes," in eight books; &s;o called, becau&s;e they contain a collection of mat|ter, &s;o put together as to make a variety not unlike that in Turkey-worked-carpets. The word, &s;tr&ocirc;maties, &s;ays Era&s;mus, is taken from pictured carpets, or tape&s;try." It is u&s;ed here, &s;ays Du-pin, "for that mixture we &s;ee in tape&s;try, and imports as much as mi&s;cellaneous commentaries, or di&s;cour&s;es." Clement him&s;elf gives us this idea of his work of &s;tromes. "The&s;e books, &s;ays he, are &s;tored with varieties, as their name imports. We pa&s;s on continually from one thing to another." He al&s;o calls them, "a variegated con|texture of di&s;cour&s;es;" which he com|pares "to a meadow, a tract of land, or a garden, wherein one may find all &s;orts of herbs, flowers, and fruits, of which we may gather as we plea&s;e." And &s;uch, in truth, are the&s;e books called, &s;tromata. They are as a mixed compo&s;ition, and contain as great a variety of all &s;orts of learning as could well be put together.</P>
<P>IN his "exhortation to the Gentiles," he &s;trongly repre&s;ents, and largely expo&s;es,
<PB N="441" REF="012009_0450_0F894068B56A9368">
the folly, and impiety, of the Pagan-idola|try; and then, with great cogency, urges to the profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity, and the wor&s;hip of the one only living and true God.</P>
<P>IN his "paedagogue," he tutors and in|&s;tructs the newly initiated converts to Chri&s;tianity; pre&s;cribing many wi&s;ely adapted rules to promote their increa&s;e in grace, until they attain to the "fullne&s;s of the &s;tature of men in Chri&s;t."</P>
<P>IN his "&s;tromata," he admini&s;ters "&s;trong meat" to them who are of "full age," and have "their &s;en&s;es exer|ci&s;ed to di&s;cern both good and evil;" en|deavouring to lead this kind of per&s;ons into a more clo&s;e and intimate acquaint|ance with the my&s;teries of religion. He tells us him&s;elf, that he purpo&s;ely wrote the&s;e books, &s;o as that the&s;e my&s;teries might not be clearly di&s;covered to tho&s;e who were not as yet initiated; while others, who were, might under&s;tand them to their advantage. "Our de&s;ign, (&s;ays he) was, (as Du-pin tran&s;lates him) to conceal, and, if I may &s;o &s;ay, to embroil things, that &s;o none but the intelligent, and tho&s;e who will take pains to inform them&s;elves, may be able to comprehend

them." In agreement with this account, it is the truth of fact, that he often writes in a manner &s;o ob&s;cure, as not to be ea&s;ily under&s;tood. He ob&s;erves frequently no order in the&s;e books. They are rather a collection of incoherent varieties, than an exact methodical compo&s;ure.</P>
<P>PERHAPS, no one of the Fathers has been more highly celebrated than this Clement, either by ancient, or more mo|dern writers. Alexander, Bi&s;hop of Je|ru&s;alem, and contemporary with him, in his "epi&s;tle to Origen," calls him the "&s;acred Clement;" and &s;ays, "he was "his ma&s;ter, and had been profitable to him." Eu&s;ebius, in his cronicle, makes mention of him as "an excellent ma&s;ter of the Chri&s;tian philo&s;ophy," and one "eminent for his writings." He el&s;ewhere more than once calls him "the admira|ble Clement." Jerom, in his catalogue of illu&s;trious men, &s;ays of his works, "they are full of erudition, borrowed from the trea&s;ures of the divine &s;cripture, and &s;ecu|lar literature:" and, in his epi&s;tle to Mag|nus, declares it as his opinion, that "Cle|ment was the mo&s;t learned of all men." And, having mentioned the chief of his works, adds, "what is there in them un|learned?
<PB N="443" REF="012009_0452_0F89406B152A6178">
What, not taken out of the very depths of philo&s;ophy?" He is honored, by more modern writers, with the titles of a "mo&s;t excellent, mo&s;t learned, mo&s;t eloquent man;" one who "exceeded all others in incredible knowledge." The learned Daille &s;ays of him,
<Q>What can you name more mixed, and fuller of variety than his &s;tromata, as he calls them, and his other works? which are throughout interlaced with hi&s;torical allu&s;ions, opinions, &s;entences, and pro|verbs, out of all &s;orts of writers, both &s;acred and prophane; heightened here with rich light&s;ome colors, then &s;haded with darkne&s;s, in &s;uch &s;ort as that it is a vain thing for an ignorant per&s;on to hope ever to reach his meaning.</Q>
The greate&s;t encomium of him we meet with in Gentianus Heroetius, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In epi&s;. ante oper. Clem.</NOTE> who, among others, tran&s;lated his works into Latin; but this is too long to be in&s;erted here.</P>
<P>THE highe&s;t &s;trains in which Clement has been commended, are not, as I imagine, too great, as they re&s;pect his learning. This, as Dr. Lardner's expre&s;&s;ion is, was "prodi|gious." And it is really wonderful, as the invention of the art of printing is much be|low
<PB N="444" REF="012009_0453_0F89406BADFA4F38">
his day, and it was therefore in his power to read only manu&s;cript copies of the works of others, how he could find ways to come at the &s;ight of &s;uch a multitude of them, as he &s;eems to have been perfect|ly acquainted with. There was &s;carce a pagan philo&s;opher, poet, or hi&s;torian, however near or di&s;tant from the age in which he lived, but he made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of their works. And the &s;ame may be &s;aid of all Chri&s;tian writers, whether they were orthodox or heretical; whe|ther they flouri&s;hed in the apo&s;tolic, or &s;ucceeding age, or about the time in which he lived. Con&s;idering his con&s;tant employment as a catechetical in&s;tructor, and his attending together herewith, for &s;ome years, the work of a Pre&s;byter of the church at Alexandria, it is amazing to think, after he had procured &s;uch an im|men&s;e variety of manu&s;cripts, how he could find time to read them; much more, how he could write &s;uch a number of books, in which he could make &s;o ea&s;y and ready a u&s;e of them! He mu&s;t have been a miracle of diligence, not loo&s;ing one inch of his time. But though I am a&s;toni&s;hed at his learning, I cannot think he was eminently great in regard of judg|ment. It will not be di&s;owned, by any

who have read his works, that his rea&s;on|ing too often will not bear examination; which cannot ea&s;ily be accounted for, if he had been as judicious as he was learned. And if I &s;hould add, that his religious &s;en|timents, in &s;ome points, were not agreea|ble to truth, it would not be di&s;puted.&mdash; But his abundant labors, in the cau&s;e of God, while living, and the u&s;efulne&s;s of his writings, in many re&s;pects, &s;ince his death, are more than enough to weigh down the mi&s;takes that may have dropped from his pen.</P>

<P>PAEDOG. lib. i. p, 120. edit. pott. We have here the following incidental pa&s;|&s;age, "If we, who have rule [<HI>proegou|menoi t&ocirc;n ekkle&s;i&ocirc;n</HI>] over the churches are Shepherds, or Pa&s;tors [<HI>poimenes</HI>] after the image of the good Shepherd."&mdash;</P>
<P>Ib. lib. iii. p. 291. In proof the impiety of women's wearing foreign hair, a|mong other arguments, he u&s;es this, "On whom or what [<HI>tini</HI>] will the Pre&s;byter [<HI>Pre&s;buteros</HI>] impo&s;e his hand? To whom, or what, will he give his ble&s;&s;ing? not

<P>Ib. lib. ib. p. 309. Having mentioned a variety of &s;cripture precepts, well adapt|ed to di&s;countenance iniquity, he goes on, and &s;ays, "Very many other commands, appertaining to &s;elect per&s;ons, are written in the &s;acred books, &s;ome to Pre&s;byters [<HI>Pre&s;buterois</HI>;] &s;ome to Bi&s;hops [<HI>Epi&s;kopois</HI>;] &s;ome to Deacons [<HI>Diakonois</HI>;] and &s;ome to widows."</P>
<P>STROM. lib, iii. p. 546. In di&s;cour&s;ing upon the doctrine of continence and mar|riage, he occa&s;ionally brings in the&s;e words, "Again, &s;ays he, [the Apo&s;tle Paul] tho&s;e are to be appointed Bi&s;hops [<HI>Epi&s;kopous dei kathi&s;ta&s;thai,</HI>] who, from ruling their own hou&s;e, are exerci&s;ed to the knowledge of ruling the whole church."</P>
<P>IB. lib. ib. p. 552. Having cited that apo&s;tolic direction, 1. Tim. v. 14, 15, "I will that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the hou&s;e, give none oc|ca&s;ion to the adver&s;ary to &s;peak reproach|fully," he adds, "but he mu&s;t be the hu&s;band of one wife only, whether he be

<P>IN. lib. ib. p. 561. Having mentioned a number of pa&s;&s;ages, in one or another of Paul's epi&s;tles, in vindication of marriage, he goes on, "What can they &s;ay to the&s;e things, who inveigh again&s;t marriage?" and adds this con&s;ideration further, "&s;ince he [this &s;ame Apo&s;tle] enjoins, that the Bi&s;hop [<HI>Epi&s;kopos</HI>] to be &s;et over the church [<HI>t&ecirc;s ekkl&ecirc;&s;ias aph&ecirc;gei&s;thai</HI>] be one who rules his own hou&s;e well."</P>
<P>IB. lib. vi. p. 793. "He therefore who has moderated his affections in the fir&s;t place, and by carefully exerci&s;ing him&s;elf to &s;ubdue his pa&s;&s;ions, hath obtained the ma&s;tery of them, and hath grown up to the bene|ficence of Gno&s;tic perfection, advances indeed from thence to an equal rank with the Angels. And now being full of light, and &s;hining like the &s;un in acts of goodne&s;s, he ha&s;tens, by a righteous know|ledge, through the love of God, to the holy man&s;ion, in like manner as the Apo&s;|tles: not that they became Apo&s;tles from any excelling peculiarity of their nature &s;ince Judas was cho&s;en with them, but
<PB N="448" REF="012009_0457_0F89406EAE247060">
&s;uch became Apo&s;tles, being cho&s;en by him who fore&s;ees even the ends. He there|fore who was not elected together with them, Matthias, when he had &s;hewed him|&s;elf worthy to be an Apo&s;tle, was put in the place of Judas. It is now therefore al|lowable for tho&s;e al&s;o who have exerci&s;ed them&s;elves in the divine commandments, and have perfectly and gno&s;tically lived ac|cording to the go&s;pel, to be a&s;cribed into the number of the Apo&s;tles. This man is in reality a Pre&s;byter [<HI>Pre&s;byteros,</HI>] and a true Deacon [<HI>Diakonos</HI>] of the purpo&s;e of God, if he does, and teaches, the things of the Lord: not ordained of men, nor becau&s;e a Pre&s;byter [<HI>Pre&s;byteros</HI>] there|fore e&s;teemed a righteous man; but be|cau&s;e a righteous man, therefore now reck|oned in the Pre&s;bytery [<HI>en Pre&s;byterio kat a|legomenos:</HI>] and though here upon earth he hath not been honored with the chief &s;eat [<HI>pr&oacute;tokathedria,</HI>] yet he &s;hall &s;et down among the four and twenty thrones, judg|ing the people, as John &s;ays in the Reve|lation. For the &s;cheme of &s;alvation is, in reality, ONE, reaching from the begin|ing of the world down to us, though &s;uppo&s;ed to be different in its be&s;towment, according to different generations and times. For it is fit and congruous, that

there &s;hould be one immutable be&s;tow|ment of &s;alvation, by <HI>one</HI> God, through <HI>one</HI> Lord, in <HI>diver&s;e manners</HI> profitable: on account whereof the middle-partition is taken away, which divided the Greek from the Jew, that they might be a pecu|liar people, and &s;o both come into unity of faith: and from both there is one elec|tion; and of the cho&s;en, &s;ome, he &s;ays, are more cho&s;en.

<HEAD>REMARKS and OBSERVATIONS on the foregoing TESTIMONIES.</HEAD>
<P>IT is obvious, upon the &s;lighte&s;t view of the above offered te&s;timonies, that Cle|ment, no more than the writers before him, can, with the lea&s;t &s;hadow of rea|&s;on, be produced as witne&s;&s;ing to the FACTS that are the grand &s;ubject under con&s;ideration. He &s;ays not a word, from whence it can be &s;o much as collected by remote con&s;equence, that he thought Bi|&s;hops had an EXCLUSIVE RIGHT to con|fer
<PB N="453" REF="012009_0462_0F8940726E78D1F0">
HOLY ORDERS; nor has he any where hinted, that it was ever the PRAC|TICE, in his day, or at any other time, for Bi&s;hops, as a DISTINCT ORDER of go&s;pel officers, to perform the work of ORDINA|TION. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of their ex|clu&s;ive right to GOVERN THE CHURCH. It is ob&s;ervable, in paedag. p. 120, though a PRESBYTER of the church of Alexan|dria, he includes him&s;elf in the number of tho&s;e <HI>pro&ecirc;goumenoi,</HI> or chief leaders, who are e&s;teemed Shepherds. "We, &s;ays he, who have rule in the churches, <HI>t&ocirc;n ekkle|&s;i&ocirc;n pro&ecirc;goumenoi.</HI>" And as to CONFIR|MATION, he no where mentions it, unle&s;s "the impo&s;ition of the hand," paedog. p. 291, may be &s;uppo&s;ed to refer to this cu&s;|tom. If this &s;hould be the truth, it is the fir&s;t hint we have, in all primititive an|tiquity, of &s;uch a practice in the church. But then, it de&s;erves particular notice, this te&s;timony can be of no &s;ervice to the epi&s;copal claim; for, not the Bi&s;hop, but the PRESBYTER, is repre&s;ented as "lay|ing on his hand." It could not therefore be, according to Clement, the appropriate work of a Bi&s;hop, a peculium of his of|fice as &s;uch.</P>
<P>IT is acknowledged, Clement once u&s;es that mode of diction, "Bi&s;hops, Pre&s;byters,
<PB N="454" REF="012009_0463_0F89407332968408">
Deacons;" and once more thus varied, "Pre&s;byters, Bi&s;hops, Deacons:" and he is the fir&s;t writer, Ignatius only excepted, if he is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the writer of the epi&s;tles a&s;cribed to him, that ever u&s;ed this manner of &s;peaking. But his thus writing is an in&s;ufficient ground on which to repre&s;ent him as a witne&s;s, that Bi&s;hops were, in his day, an order of officers in the church di&s;tinct from, and &s;uperior to, that of Pre&s;byters. The term, Bi&s;hop, may properly be u&s;ed as a di&s;tingui&s;hing name, though it &s;hould import no e&s;&s;en|tial &s;uperiority of office between him and a Pre&s;byter. Arch-Bi&s;hop is an appella|tion that di&s;tingui&s;hes the per&s;on to whom it is applied from one that is a Bi&s;hop only, and is ever u&s;ed to this purpo&s;e; and yet, Arch-Bi&s;hop and Bi&s;hop are one and the &s;ame order of officers in the church, Epi&s;|copalians them&s;elves being judges. So the name, Rector, points out a difference be|tween the per&s;ons called by this name, and tho&s;e that are called Curates; and yet, they both partake of the &s;ame e&s;&s;en|tial powers of preaching, bapti&s;ing, and admini&s;tring the Lord's &s;upper. It might, about this time, begin to be a cu&s;tom, not to have a Prae&s;es, or Head-Pre&s;byter in the church, but to di&s;tingui&s;h him by
<PB N="455" REF="012009_0464_0F894073ED3C6220">
<HI>appropriating</HI> to him the name of Bi&s;hop. And this might be the only rea&s;on of Clement's &s;peaking in that mode, "Bi|&s;hops, Pre&s;byters, Deacons." Mo&s;t cer|tainly, it could not be, becau&s;e he thought there were three di&s;tinct orders in the church, and that Bi&s;hops were, as Chri&s;t's officers, ve&s;ted with e&s;&s;ential powers &s;u|perior to Pre&s;byters, as Pre&s;byters are with powers e&s;&s;entially &s;uperior to Deacons; and for the following con&s;iderations.</P>
<P N="1">I. IN paedag. lib. iii. p. 309, his enu|meration runs thus, "Pre&s;byters, Bi&s;hops, Deacons;" which cannot ea&s;ily be ac|counted for, if he had &s;uppo&s;ed Bi&s;hops to have been an order in the church &s;uperi|or to that of Pre&s;byters, as Pre&s;byters are to that of Deacons. He no where, in &s;peaking of Pre&s;byters and Deacons, places Dea|cons before Pre&s;byters; but, as Pre&s;byters are a &s;uperior order of officers, he always mentions them fir&s;t. And there is no imaginable rea&s;on to think, but he would have done the &s;ame by Bi&s;hops, if, in his apprehen&s;ion, they had been officers in the church &s;uperior in their order to Pre&s;|byters. It is worthy of ob&s;ervation, Ignati|us does not give us the enumeration in this form; but places Bi&s;hops before Pre&s;byters.
<PB N="456" REF="012009_0465_0F894075957D28E0">
And it is que&s;tionable, whether an in&s;tance can be produced, after Bi&s;hops were look|ed upon as officers in the church of a &s;u|perior order to Pre&s;byters, from any wri|ter, who favored this opinion, wherein he places Pre&s;byters before Bi&s;hops in an enumeration of church officers. But this I barely mention as not unworthy of notice.</P>
<P N="2">II. IT is a con&s;ideration of more weight that in his book "quis dives &s;alvandus &s;it?" the church officer he &s;peaks of under the name of BISHOP, he likewi&s;e calls PRES|BYTER. His words are, "He [the Apo&s;|tle John] looked upon the BISHOP, who had been &s;et over the whole church, and &s;aid, I commit this young man to thy care." It follows a few lines after, "and the PRESBYTER, [<HI>o Pre&s;byter</HI>] taking the young Man, brought him home."&mdash; It is not in any degree probable, if, by the word, Bi&s;hop, Clement meant an officer in the church of a &s;uperior order to that of Pre&s;byters, he would have indifferently u&s;ed the terms, Bi&s;hop and Pre&s;byter, to point him out. Had the word, Bi&s;hop, been with him the known certainly AP|PROPRIATED term to di&s;tingui&s;h the fir&s;t or highe&s;t of three orders of officers in the
<PB N="457" REF="012009_0466_0F894076571F0588">
church, there would be an impropriety, not to &s;ay ab&s;urdity, in his calling that of|ficer a PRESBYTER, who was a Bi&s;hop: nor ought it to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that he would have been guilty of &s;o gro&s;s a reflection on the Bi&s;hop of a church.</P>
<P>IT is &s;aid, in an&s;wer, this Bi&s;hop, who is pointed out by the term Pre&s;byter [<HI>Pre&s;|byteros,</HI>] in the above cited place, is after|wards, in this very &s;tory, &s;poken of in that &s;tile, <HI>o Pre&s;byt&ecirc;s,</HI> "the old man." Upon which the plea is, that he might be called <HI>Pre&s;byteros,</HI> not on account of his being a Pre&s;byter, but an elderly per&s;on. It is confe&s;&s;ed the word, <HI>Pre&s;byteros,</HI> is &s;ome|times to be under&s;tood as meaning nothing more than an aged man; but this mean|ing can be given to it, only when the con|nection of the di&s;cour&s;e, where it is u&s;ed, makes it nece&s;&s;ary: otherwi&s;e, it is, with all the Fathers, an appropriated term, and not u&s;ed by any of them, either before, or after, Clement, but to denote an officer in the church of Chri&s;t. And, what may be worthy of &s;pecial notice, it is never u&s;ed by Clement, relative to an officer of the church, to &s;ignify <HI>meerly,</HI> or <HI>only,</HI> his being "a man in years." Why then &s;hould he be thought to u&s;e it in this &s;en&s;e, in the
<PB N="458" REF="012009_0467_0F894076EEB8E060">
pa&s;&s;age under con&s;ideration? And, had he intended to convey the idea of nothing more than "an old man," why did he not u&s;e the word <HI>Pre&s;byt&ecirc;s</HI>? He might, with equal ea&s;e, and more propriety, have u&s;ed this word, in both pa&s;&s;ages that have been brought to view; and his not doing it, plain|ly indicates, that he intended, in the fir&s;t of them, to lead us into the thought, that, by <HI>Pre&s;byteros,</HI> he meant the &s;ame officer in the church, he had ju&s;t before called Bi&s;hop, <HI>Epi&s;kopos</HI>; and in the &s;econd, to &s;ignify that he was an "elderly per&s;on." And there might be a &s;pecial propriety in his &s;peaking of him, in this &s;econd pa&s;&s;age, as an "elderly per&s;on;" as this would aggravate his fault in not taking better care of "the young man that had been depo&s;ited with him as his charge."</P>
<P>IT will add weight to what has been offered, in defence of Clement's promi&s;|cuou&s;ly u&s;ing the words, Bi&s;hop and Pre&s;byter, in that part of his &s;tory re|lating to the Apo&s;tle John, we have been con&s;idering, if we compare his u&s;e of the words here, with the u&s;e of them in &s;trom. lib, iii. p. 556, and &s;trom. ib. p. 552. In the former of the&s;e pages he &s;ays, "tho&s;e ought to be appointed BISHOPS, who, from
<PB N="459" REF="012009_0468_0F894077ADEE7410">
ruling their own hou&s;e, have been exer|ci&s;ed to rule the whole church." In the latter of them, his words are the&s;e, "He mu&s;t be the hu&s;band of one wife only, whether he be a PRESBYTER, or Dea|con, or Laic, if he would u&s;e marriage without blame." Let it now be ob&s;erved, the&s;e directions, re&s;pecting a "BISHOP'S ruling his own hou&s;e," and a "PRESBY|TER'S having but one wife," are both ta|ken, or rather cited, from the Apo&s;tle Paul's fir&s;t epi&s;tle to Timothy, iiid ch. 2d and 4th v. where the words are the&s;e, "A Bi&s;hop mu&s;t be the hu&s;band of one wife,"'- and "one that ruleth well his own hou&s;e." Now, that very officer in the church, which the Apo&s;tle Paul calls a BISHOP, is called by Clement, in one of the above pa&s;&s;ages, a BISHOP; and, in the other, a PRES|BYTER. He mu&s;t certainly mean, by PRESBYTER, preci&s;ely the &s;ame officer, both he him&s;elf, and the Apo&s;tle Paul, meant by BISHOP: or there would be no pertinency in his application of the&s;e texts. This, I &s;hould think, mu&s;t be &s;ufficient to put it beyond all rea&s;onable di&s;pute, that the word, <HI>Pre&s;byteros,</HI> in Clement's &s;tory of the Apo&s;tle John, is u&s;ed in its APPROPRIATED &s;en&s;e, to &s;ignify an officer in the church; and, as this officer, who
<PB N="460" REF="012009_0469_0F89407874615128">
is called a PRESBYTER, is al&s;o called a BISHOP, tho words mu&s;t be con&s;idered as promi&s;cuou&s;ly u&s;ed to mean one and the &s;ame eccle&s;ia&s;tical officer: &s;o the words are u&s;ed, in the places we have compared with this; and no better rea&s;on can be given for their not being &s;o u&s;ed here, than that of &s;erving an hypothe&s;is.</P>
<P N="3">3. IT is of &s;till more important con|&s;ideration, that Clement, in &s;trom. vii. p. 830, evidently appears to have had no knowledge of more than TWO ORDERS of officers in the Chri&s;tian church, that of <HI>Pre&s;byters,</HI> and that of <HI>Deacons.</HI> For, when he is purpo&s;ely &s;peaking of the &s;a|cred eccle&s;ia&s;tical functions, he particu|larly mentions the&s;e TWO, and NO MORE. One, he con&s;iders as &s;uperior, calling it <HI>belti&ocirc;tik&ecirc;,</HI> becau&s;e intended and adapted to "make men better:" the other he repre|&s;ents as inferior, calling it <HI>up&ecirc;retik&ecirc;,</HI> be|cau&s;e de&s;igned for a lower kind of mini|&s;try. The &s;uperior office he appropriates to PRESBYTERS; the inferior one to DEACONS: not giving the lea&s;t hint of any other, or higher office in the chri&s;tian church. Can this be accounted for, if he knew of any ORDER in the church higher than that, in which Pre&s;byters are
<PB N="461" REF="012009_0470_0F8940792FA7E3E0">
placed? Surely, if Bi&s;hops were officers in the church of a &s;uperior and higher order than Pre&s;byters, he would not have pa&s;&s;ed over this order of men in total &s;ilence, while he is particular in taking notice of the TWO LOWER ORDERS, that of Pre&s;byters, and that of Deacons. It is ob&s;ervable, he thought it proper, even in the very pa&s;&s;age we are upon, to a&s;cend to heaven in comtemplation, that he might bring in the Angels of God as employed in the TWO KINDS of mini&s;try he had been treating of; and yet, though Bi&s;hops were, in his opinion, (as Epi&s;copalians would have us believe) the mo&s;t exalted order of church-officers Chri&s;t had upon earth, he &s;ays not a word about them, or any &s;ervice they had to do; while, at the &s;ame time, he takes particular notice both of Pre&s;|byters and Deacons, &s;o much below Bi|&s;hops as not (comparatively) to de&s;erve being mentioned at all. This is truly a&s;toni&s;hing! And Clement mu&s;t be voted inexcu&s;able, unle&s;s we &s;uppo&s;e, (what I take to be the certain truth) that with him, Bi&s;hops and Pre&s;byters were one and the &s;ame order of men in the church, and might properly be &s;poken of under the name, either of Bi&s;hop, or Pre&s;byter. And in this view of the matter, there is a con|&s;i&s;tency,
<PB N="462" REF="012009_0471_0F894079EF7B3A48">
propriety, and cogency, in this di&s;cour&s;e of Clement: otherwi&s;e, it is, to &s;ay the lea&s;t, &s;trange and altogether un|accountable.</P>
<P N="4">IV. IN the la&s;t place, it is further evi|dent, from what Clement has &s;aid, in &s;trom. vi. p. 793, that he had no notion of more than TWO ORDERS of officers in the church of Chri&s;t; or, in other words, of Bi&s;hops as the fir&s;t and mo&s;t &s;uperior of THREE ORDERS. I have purpo&s;ely given the reader the whole 13th &s;ection of this 6th book, that he might be able to take a complete view of what he has offered upon this head. And if he is plea&s;ed to attend to what is contained in this &s;ection, he will find, that neither Apo&s;|tles, Pre&s;byters Deacons, or Laymen, are e&s;teemed, by Clement, excellent here, or intere&s;ted in felicity hereafter, but in pro|portion to their chri&s;tian knowledge, wi&s;|dom, and goodne&s;s; that is, their being more or le&s;s perfect gno&s;tics. In illu&s;t|ration of this, he &s;ays,
<Q>he is in reality a PRESBYTER in the church, and he is a true DEACON, who does, and teaches, the things of the Lord:&mdash;not account|ed a righteous man, becau&s;e a Pre&s;by|ter; but becau&s;e a righteous man there|fore

cho&s;en into the Pre&s;bytery: and though he be not honored with the FIRST SEAT <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A friend of mine, well &s;killed in the Greek, and who has particularly acquainted him&s;elf with the writings of this Clement, is clearly of the mind, that the PR&Ocirc;TOKA|THEDRIA, he here &s;peaks of, does not mean the FIRST CHAIR, SEAT, or PLACE in the PRESBYTERY, but the FIRST SESSION in the church here on earth, as well as in heaven. He had been &s;aying, in the imme|diately preceeding words, a man's being "truly righteous" was the rea&s;on, in God's account, why he was "cho&s;en into the Pre&s;bytery"; and though he &s;hould not be honored, here on earth, with the PR&Ocirc;TOKATHEDRIA, the FIRST SESSION, he &s;hould hereafter &s;et down on the twenty-four thrones," the HIGHEST AD|VANCEMENT of the Saints in glory. He is ra|ther more explicit, upon this head, a little onwards, in this &s;ame &s;ection; where, &s;peaking of the "PROGRESSIONS of tho&s;e who have lived, according to the go&s;pel, in the perfection of righteou&s;ne&s;s, he &s;ays, "the&s;e men, being taken up into the clouds, &s;hall FIRST mini&s;ter as DEA|CONS, THEN be admitted to a RANK IN THE PRES|BYTERY; which means the &s;ame thing with what he had, a little before, &s;poken of as "being honored with the PR&Ocirc;TOKATHEDRIA, the FIRST or HIGHEST SES|SION in the church, in the future &s;tate of glory." I &s;ee not but this critici&s;m of my friend is ju&s;t: it certainly falls in with the method of rea&s;oning, Clement has gone into, throughout this whole paragraph. However, I was not willing to depart from that &s;en&s;e of the word, in which it is univer&s;ally taken (&s;o far as my knowledge extends) by epi&s;copal writers. In this &s;en&s;e I have con&s;idered it; and offered that upon it which is, as I imagine, too force|able to be &s;et a&s;ide. The argument is much &s;tronger upon the interpretation of my friend. If this exhibits the truth, it is put beyond all po&s;&s;ible di&s;pute, that Clement knew of no HIGHER ORDER in the church than that of PRESBY|TERS.</NOTE> on earth, yet &s;hall here|after &s;it down on the twenty-four thrones, judging the people.</Q>
It is at fir&s;t &s;ight obvious, that Clement here makes mention of TWO ORDERS only in the church, that of PRESBYTERS, and that of DEACONS. And it is equally evident, that the fir&s;t &s;eat, he &s;peaks of, relates to the PRESBYTERY, and is the place of one, who is a con&s;tituent member, in common with the other Pre&s;byters, of this &s;enate, or eccle&s;ia&s;tical body. But, what does he mean by this <HI>fir&s;t &s;eat</HI>? One, not bia&s;&s;ed in his mind, would ea&s;ily and naturally
<PB N="464" REF="012009_0473_0F89407B6F566880">
be led to under&s;tand, by it, the &s;eat of the Head-Pre&s;byter, or Prae&s;es of the Pre&s;by|tery. It cannot rea&s;onably be thought, that Clement meant by it a &s;eat that was proper, not to a con&s;tituent member of the Pre&s;byterate, but to an officer in the church of another order, di&s;tinct from, and &s;uperior to, that of Pre&s;byters. This would be to make him &s;peak very impro|perly. For the <HI>fir&s;t &s;eat</HI> in a Pre&s;bytery obviou&s;ly and certainly imports a parity of <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> powers in the per&s;ons that con|&s;titute this body; though one of them may, in &s;ome re&s;pects, for prudential&punc; rea|&s;ons, have the precedency, or &s;uperiority, &s;o as to be &s;eated in the <HI>fir&s;t chair.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="465" REF="012009_0474_0F89407C2F792320">THIS will appear in a yet fuller light, if we examine what Clement has offered, in this &s;ame &s;ection, upon the progre&s;&s;i|ons in the church here, and in glory here|after. "Says he,
<Q>The&s;e progre&s;&s;ions in the church here, of Bi&s;hops, Pre&s;|byters, Deacons, I take to be imitations of the angelical glory, and of that di&s;|pen&s;ation, which the &s;criptures tell us, they look for, who, following the &s;teps of the Apo&s;tles, have lived, according to the go&s;pel, in the perfection of righ|teou&s;ne&s;s: the&s;e men, being taken up into the clouds, &s;hall fir&s;t mini&s;ter as Deacons, then be admitted to a rank in the Pre&s;bytery according to the pro|ce&s;&s;ion of glory, (for one glory differ|eth from another) until they grow up to a perfect man.</Q></P>
<P>THIS pa&s;&s;age, I am &s;en&s;ible, Epi&s;copa|lians bring as the &s;tronge&s;t te&s;timony, from Clement, in favor of a threefold order in the church, under the &s;pecified names of Bi&s;hops, Pre&s;byters, and Deacons. But &s;uch a con&s;truction of the words will not at all con&s;i&s;t, either with the pa&s;&s;age it|&s;elf, or what he has el&s;ewhere &s;aid upon this &s;ame &s;ubject. For, let it be ob&s;erved,</P>
<P><PB N="466" REF="012009_0475_0F89407CF06DB868">HE &s;peaks of the&s;e "progre&s;&s;ions, as "imitations of the angelic glory." Upon which Sir Peter King, in his "enquiry into the con&s;titution of the primitive church," p. 100, makes the following re|mark, in &s;upport of the opinion, that only two eccle&s;ia&s;tical orders, viz. Bi&s;hops and Deacons, or Pre&s;byters and Deacons, are noticed by Clement, namely, that "the&s;e orders are here re&s;embled by the angelic orders. Now, the &s;cripture mentions but two orders, viz. Arch-Angels and Angels; the Arch-Angels pre&s;iding over the An|gels, and the Angels obeying, and attend|ing on the Arch-Angels. According to this re&s;emblance, therefore, there mu&s;t be but two eccle&s;ia&s;tical orders in the church, which are Bi&s;hops or Pre&s;byters pre&s;iding and governing, with the Deacons attend|ing and obeying." This pa&s;&s;age has often been quoted from Sir Peter, as carrying conviction with it. But it does not ap|pear to me, that Clement here intended to &s;ugge&s;t, that there were no more than two orders of Angels, or that he at all made this thought the ground of the "imita|tion of the angelical glory," he &s;peaks of. You will then a&s;k, what does he ground it upon? This may be readily known by comparing his words here, with what he
<PB N="467" REF="012009_0476_0F89407DAD4B9C90">
&s;ays in &s;trom. vii. p. 830: where, having treated of the &s;acred functions in TWO ORDERS only; the one &s;uperior, which he appropriates to Pre&s;byters; the other in|ferior, which he makes proper to Deacons, he then adds, that by BOTH THESE MI|NISTRIES the ANGELS &s;erve God in the di&s;pen&s;ation of the affairs of this earth." Having, in this place, &s;poken of the An|gels, as employed in TWO KINDS of mi|ni&s;try, the one analogous to that of Pre&s;|byters, the other to that of Deacons, it &s;hould &s;eem obvious and natural, when he &s;peaks, in the pa&s;&s;age under con&s;idera|tion, of the "progre&s;&s;ions in the church, as imitations of the angelical glory," to un|der&s;tand by the&s;e progre&s;&s;ions, the pa&s;&s;ing from the lower mini&s;try in the church, that of Deacons, to the highe&s;t which is a rank among Pre&s;byters. And let it be remembered here, it is the glory of the An|gels in Heaven to &s;erve God in mini&s;tring to our earth; and their progre&s;&s;ion in glo|ry, &s;o far as it re&s;pects their mini&s;try in the TWO KINDS particularly mentioned by Clement, will be higher or lower accord|ing to the higher or lower nature of the TWO MINISTRIES in which they &s;erve God in the di&s;pen&s;ation of the things of this earth. And, in this view, the "pro|gre&s;&s;ions
<PB N="468" REF="012009_0477_0F89407E6EB6D108">
in the church" are "imitations of the evangelical glory." And thus it is ex|plained even by Clement him&s;elf. For, &s;ays he, tho&s;e, who
<Q>treading in the &s;teps of the Apo&s;tles, have lived in evangelical perfec|tion of righteou&s;ne&s;s, being taken up into the clouds, &s;hall <HI>fir&s;t mini&s;ter as</HI> DEACONS, <HI>then be admitted to a rank in the</HI> PRESBY|TERY, according to the proce&s;&s;ion in glory.</Q>
Ob&s;erve, their <HI>fir&s;t</HI> advance|ment is their <HI>mini&s;tring as</HI> DEACONS; their <HI>next</HI> and <HI>highe&s;t</HI> proce&s;&s;ion is their being <HI>admitted into the</HI> PRESBYTERATE: though it &s;hould be noticed here, there is a pro|gre&s;&s;ion in <HI>degree</HI> even in the Pre&s;byterate. For Clement, in this very &s;ection, has told us of a FIRST SEAT in the Pre&s;by|tery; which, if filled with a Prae&s;es, or Head-Pre&s;byter, under the name of Bi|&s;hop, will exactly an&s;wer the progre&s;&s;ions of Bi&s;hops, Pre&s;byters, Deacons here &s;po|ken of: nor can they be an&s;wered any other way, in con&s;i&s;tency with Clement's di&s;cour&s;e upon this &s;ubject, wherever he treats upon it. He &s;peaks in this &s;ection, and very particularly in &s;trom. vii. p. 830, of the two different orders of church-of|ficers, that of Pre&s;byters, and that of Dea|cons, and mentions no more. Bi&s;hops therefore, with him, could not be officers
<PB N="469" REF="012009_0478_0F89408018AB8958">
in the church of an order &s;uperior to that of Pre&s;byters; though they might be of|ficers having a precedency, a &s;uperiority, in degree: as the Prae&s;es of a Pre&s;byte|ry, though of the &s;ame order, is yet in degree above the re&s;t. And Clement has mo&s;t obviou&s;ly led us to conceive of Bi|&s;hops in this light, that is, as nothing more than the fir&s;t, the chief, the highe&s;t, in degree among the members that con&s;ti|tute what he calls the Pre&s;bytery. And, as he no where mentions any higher eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;enate, or body of men, or any higher order of officers in the Chri&s;|tian church, we are unavoidably con&s;train|ed to under&s;tand, by his Bi&s;hop, the Prae|&s;es, Chairman, or he that occupies the fir&s;t &s;eat in the Pre&s;bytery.</P>
<P>I SHALL only add, the works of Cle|ment we have extracted from are the la&s;t extant, within the &s;econd century: nor did he write the&s;e, until nearly the end of it. Dodwell &s;ays, between the beginning of the year 193, and the end of the year 195. Du-pin places this Clement the fir&s;t among the Fathers of the third cen|tury. And yet, he cannot be brought as a WITNESS, in favor of the GRAND FACTS pleaded for by Epi&s;copalians. Yea, in
<PB N="470" REF="012009_0479_0F894080ADCF0530">
the times after him, when there was a di&s;tinction in fact between Bi&s;hops and Pre&s;byters, it is no ea&s;y matter to point out preci&s;ely wherein it con&s;i&s;ted. It is with me, pa&s;t all doubt, that the idea of a Bi&s;hop, as di&s;tingui&s;hed from a Pre&s;by|ter, continually varied as corruption in|crea&s;ed, until, by degrees, there was pla|ced over the church an UNIVERSAL BI|SHOP, under the name of THE POPE OF ROME.&mdash;But I mu&s;t not go beyond the times to which this work is confined.</P>

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE now, at the expence of con|&s;iderable time and pains, brought to view, and con&s;idered, according to the plan laid down at fir&s;t, all that is &s;aid, by all the genuine writers, until towards the going out of the &s;econd century, (&s;o far as their writings, either in whole, or in part, have reached us) relative to Epi&s;copacy. And, upon a review of what has been offered, I cannot but expre&s;s my &s;urpri&s;e at the a&s;&s;urance, with which &s;ome prelatical authors affirm it to be a FACT, UNIVER|SALLY witne&s;&s;ed to, even from the EAR|LIEST AGES, that Bi&s;hops were officers in the church of an ORDER di&s;tinct from,
<PB N="471" REF="012009_0480_0F8940816F95CB10">
and &s;uperior to, Pre&s;byters, in whom were lodged the exclu&s;ive powers of GOVERN|MENT, and ORDINATION. Says one of the&s;e writers, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Scot's Chri&s;tian Life, vol. ii, p. 406.</NOTE> "The Chri&s;tian church, in the ages next &s;ucceeding the Apo&s;tles, a&s;&s;erts with <HI>one univer&s;al con&s;ent,</HI> the uni|ver&s;al derivation of a &s;uperior order of ec|cle&s;ia&s;tic officers from the Apo&s;tles to pre|&s;ide over the church." And again, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 421.</NOTE> "If any credit may be given, either to tho&s;e writers that lived in the apo&s;tolic age, or tho&s;e who immediately &s;ucceeded them, it is evident, that Epi&s;copacy is nothing el&s;e but only the apo&s;tolical &s;uperiority derived from the hands of the Apo&s;tles, in a continued &s;ucce&s;&s;ion from generation to generation." Says another of the&s;e writers, <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">The invalidity of the di&s;&s;enting Mini&s;try," in an&s;wer to a &s;ermon of Mr. Pierce's, p. 23.</NOTE> "The &s;tanding maxim of the epi&s;copal &s;cheme [namely, that ordaining power is appropriated to Bi&s;hops, as an order in the church &s;uperior to Pre&s;byters] has the earlie&s;t records of the church to &s;upport it; and there was &s;carce any ar|ticle of faith more firmly believed." And again, <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">P. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">3.</NOTE> "We have the &s;ame evidence, that Epi&s;copacy (that is, Bi&s;hops as
<PB N="472" REF="012009_0481_0F89408234528030">
di&s;tinct from, and &s;uperior to, Pre&s;byters) was the government of the primitive church, in the pure&s;t ages of Chri&s;ti|anity, that we have for the CANON OF SCRIPTURE." Another author &s;till has the&s;e words, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Brief defence of epi&s;copal ordination," p. 9.</NOTE> "The Apo&s;tles leaving the power of ORDAINING PRESBYTERS in the hands of FIXED BISHOPS, being a matter of fact pa&s;&s;ed many years ago, the only me|thod by which we can come to the know|ledge of it is, the te&s;timony of writers, who lived in the apo&s;tolical and following ages." And this te&s;timony he puts upon the fame foot with that we have for the &s;acred &s;criptures.</P>
<P>CAN it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the&s;e writers had acquainted them&s;elves with the records of the ages that next &s;ucceeded the Apo&s;|tles? Had this been the ca&s;e, it &s;hould &s;eem impo&s;&s;ible, however bia&s;&s;ed in their minds, that they could have delivered their &s;en|timents in language &s;o replete with po&s;i|tive a&s;&s;urance. Surely, they would not have put the te&s;timonies in favor of Epi&s;|copacy, upon a par with the te&s;timonies in proof of the authority of the &s;acred books of &s;cripture. This mu&s;t have been the effect, not only of deeply root|ed prejudice, but of an hear&s;ay-know|ledge
<PB N="473" REF="012009_0482_0F894082EDD66000">
only of the mo&s;t ancient and truly primitive writings. It cannot ea&s;ily be accounted for in any other way.</P>
<P>AS the reader has had laid before him a full view of what is &s;aid, upon the doc|trine of Epi&s;copacy, from the fir&s;t hun|dred and ninety years, &s;o far as it can be collected from the extant writings of the Fathers within this period, or the re|maining fragments of their writings, he may, from ocular in&s;pection, make a &s;a|tisfactory judgment in relation to this Epi&s;copacy. Only, he &s;hould keep in mind the GRAND POINT in que&s;tion, which is, what is the truth of FACT, in the records of the ages next to the Apo&s;tles, with re&s;pect to the ORDER, and OFFICE-POWER, of Bi&s;hops? For the di&s;pute is not about the NAME of Epi&s;copacy, but the THING intended by it. Prelati&s;ts &s;ay, the FACT univer&s;ally handed down is, that Bi&s;hops are an ORDER of officers in the church di&s;tinct from, and &s;uperior to, Pre&s;byters; and that the powers of GO|VERNMENT, ORDINATION, and CONFIR|MATION, are appropriated to them: in|&s;omuch, that Pre&s;byters no more exerci|&s;ed the&s;e powers, than Deacons bapti&s;ed, or admini&s;tred the Lord's &s;upper. Let the reader have this con&s;tantly in his view, as it may rea&s;onably be expected he &s;hould,
<PB N="474" REF="012009_0483_0F894083AF1FDBA8">
while he con&s;iders the te&s;timonies that have been produced; and I may venture to &s;ay, with the highe&s;t a&s;&s;urance, that he will be in no danger of calling in que&s;|tion the authority of the new-te&s;tament-books, for want of te&s;timonies in their behalf, though he &s;hould utterly reject EPISCOPACY, in the impleaded &s;en&s;e, as having no &s;upport, either in point of RIGHT, or PRACTICE, from any thing he may have met with in the writers within the two fir&s;t ages of the Chri&s;tian church. He is accordingly appealed to, and let him be judge; taking care to act his part, in this character, upon a fair, im|partial, and thorough examination of the evidence that has been held out to his view.</P>
