<HEAD>The TESTIMONY &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>_AS it is a great Satisfaction to us that the mo&s;t of us join'd with many worthy Mini&s;ters in their A&s;&s;embly met on Pur|po&s;e at <HI>Bo&s;ton, July</HI> 7. 1743, in yielding to the &s;overeign GOD thro' CHRIST the Glory due to his Power and Grace for the late <HI>extraordinary Work</HI> of HIS SPIRIT in diver&s;e Parts of the Land; in <HI>awakening Multitudes to a deep Concern about their eternal Salvation, carrying on the Con|victions of Sin. Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Judgment in great Num|bers, to the &s;criptural and charitable Marks of true Con|ver&s;ion, as well as reviving the Power of Godline&s;s in many who were accounted the regenerate Children of God before:</HI> &mdash; So we yet rejoyce that we have farther Oc|ca&s;ion to Prai&s;e him for the <HI>continued Evidence</HI> of the Grace of Chri&s;t in the mo&s;t of tho&s;e we are acquainted with, whom from the Marks laid down in Scripture we look'd upon to be converted, and that the <HI>Liveline&s;s of Piety</HI> remains in many. For <HI>the&s;e</HI> there is al&s;o due a Return of Glory to God: and in Imitation of the pious Examples of the Saints in Scripture, we would earne&s;tly call on Them, Our&s;elves, and Others, to yield it to Him.</P>
<P>But as in the <HI>Prophets</HI> and <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> Days, in the later Days of the <HI>Reformers</HI> in <HI>Europe,</HI> and in all other Times of the extraordinary Influence of the Spirit of God and Revival of Piety, whether of a larger or le&s;s Extent; they have been but <HI>of a &s;hort Duration;</HI> the Impre&s;&s;ions

on many have been ineffectual to true Conver&s;ion, their Goodne&s;s has been like <HI>Ephraim</HI>'s of old, <HI>as the Morning Cloud and early Dew, which have quickly pa&s;s'd away;</HI> yea, the DIVINE SPIRIT being &s;lighted, he has withdrawn his Influence more than before, and given them up to a greater Blindne&s;s and Hardne&s;s than ever; yea the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing Churches in Piety have &s;oon lo&s;t their vigo|rous Love to Chri&s;t like the Church of <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> and declined to &s;uch an hateful Lukewarmne&s;s of Religion, like that of <HI>Laodicea,</HI> as to be on the Point of being utterly rejected:&mdash; So we have in our lively Times been fearful of the <HI>like Decay</HI> and <HI>Withdraw,</HI> and gave Warn|ing of them; and an&s;werable to our Apprehen&s;ions, they &s;eem to be awfully coming to pa&s;s, and are to be deeply lamented.</P>
<P>And tho' in <HI>Sea&s;ons</HI> of <HI>extraordinary Revivals,</HI> as in the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> and <HI>Reformers</HI> Days, there were <HI>many Di&s;|orders</HI> and <HI>Errors</HI> among profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tians; and no other cou'd be expected among us on the like Occa&s;ion, which have been openly and repeatedly te&s;tified again&s;t by many of the Friends of this Revival in diver&s;e Parts of the Land: yet upon Ob&s;ervation of the &s;everal Chur|ches we re&s;pectively belong to, we cannot but al&s;o te&s;tify, that Di&s;orders and Errors have been both multiplied and magnified by unfriendly Reporters, much more than they really were where there&punc; were any, but in many of our Churches there were none at all; and <HI>the Work of the</HI> HOLY SPIRIT in our Churches, <HI>as above de&s;cribed,</HI> has been grievou&s;ly mi&s;repre&s;ented and defamed, his genuine Operations overlooked or perverted, He has been denied of his de&s;erved Glory for them; but the <HI>Infirmities and Corruptions</HI> of Men, permitted of the righteous God as u&s;ual to mingle with them, have been repre&s;ented as <HI>the Work it&s;elf,</HI> and then under <HI>their Name</HI> this divine Tran&s;|action awfully &s;et at nought, as has al&s;o been u&s;ual in other Revivals, to the Reproach of the World.</P>
<P>Among other Abu&s;es it has been repre&s;ented as if <HI>&s;uch mi&s;chievous Errors</HI> as <HI>the&s;e</HI> were <HI>prevailing</HI> among

the <HI>Subjects</HI> of <HI>this Revival</HI> in <HI>the&s;e Churches,</HI> viz (1) That &s;anctifying Grace in a Mini&s;ter is nece&s;&s;ary to render the Admini&s;tration of Go&s;pel Ordinances valid. (2) That unconverted Mini&s;ters are uncapable to be In&s;truments of converting People. (3) That Sanctification, [i. e. as de&s;cribed in the A&s;&s;embly's &s;horter Catechi&s;m] is no Evidence of Ju&s;tification. (4) That an unconverted Man ought not to pray. [5] That A&s;&s;urance is e&s;&s;ential to &s;aving Faith, &s;o that whoever &s;avingly believes is certain of it and not in Darkne&s;s or Doubt about it. [6] That they &s;light the in&s;pired Scriptures as a perfect Rule of Faith and Duty. [7] That they may leave the Scrip|tures and follow Impul&s;es, Dreams &amp; Trances.

as <HI>our Fathers</HI> made a <HI>publick Confe&s;&s;ion</HI> of <HI>their Faith</HI> in <HI>their Day,</HI> and recommended it to us their Po&s;terity; we cannot but judge Our&s;elves as <HI>Now</HI> called both by God and Man, and even obliged by Tho&s;e who write and &s;peak again&s;t us, to make &s;uch <HI>a Publick Profe&s;&s;ion</HI> of <HI>our own Faith</HI> to the World: and in particular <HI>openly</HI> and <HI>freely</HI> to DECLARE, that <HI>we have not departed from the ancient Faith of the&s;e Churches;</HI> but <HI>heartily adhere to the &s;ame;</HI> and look upon the &s;aid <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter a&s;&s;em|bly's &s;horter Catechi&s;m</HI> and the famous <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith</HI> agreed on by our venerable <HI>Synod</HI> of 1680 (which <HI>Con|fe&s;&s;ion</HI> for the refre&s;hing our Memory we have diligently read over at this Meeting) as mo&s;t valuable Summaries of Chri&s;tian Doctrine, excellently expre&s;&s;ing the Mind and Will of GOD as reveal'd in the <HI>Holy Scriptures</HI> the only infallible Rule of Faith and Practice: and which <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion</HI> we wi&s;h to be reprinted and di&s;per&s;ed &s;peedily for the publick Benefit, and would earne&s;tly recommend both to Preachers and People, both of this and future Generations.</P>

the fir&s;t &s;ound and pious <HI>Fathers</HI> of <HI>New England,</HI> have been the <HI>principal Means</HI> of <HI>the late Revival;</HI> we are &s;orry to &s;ee, that under the Name of <HI>New Light,</HI> many of the <HI>Preachers</HI> of the&s;e mo&s;t important Truths, and e&s;pecially tho&s;e which concern the <HI>Office</HI> and <HI>Operation</HI> of the SPIRIT <HI>of Grace</HI> in bringing lo&s;t and peri&s;hing Souls to Chri&s;t, are by many run down and ridicul'd; as tho&s;e our pious <HI>Forefathers</HI> were in their Day, under the &s;ame or alike reproachful Terms, by many on the other Side of the Water; and <HI>they</HI> who <HI>Preach</HI> the <HI>&s;ame Truths</HI> of the Go&s;pel and experimental Piety as tho&s;e great Divines, <HI>Hooker, Cotton, Shepard, Goodwin, Owen, Flavel,</HI> the <HI>Mathers, Willard, Stoddard,</HI> are repre&s;ented by &s;ome as <HI>New Light, Enthu&s;ia&s;tical</HI> or <HI>Antinomian</HI> Preachers: whereby the awful Danger grows of bani&s;h|ing even the <HI>Faith</HI> of the <HI>glorious Office</HI> of THAT DIVINE AGENT in the Work of Conviction, Conver&s;ion, Sancti|fication and Comfort, fir&s;t out of our Pulpits, and then out of the Land. Yea, to &s;o deplorable a Pa&s;s have &s;ome Traducers of this Revival brought us, that if any of the young Generation begin to leave off their Cur&s;ing, Swearing, immoderate Drinking, ob&s;cene Di&s;cour&s;e, grow concern'd for their Souls, and repair to the Word; they are immediately branded and vilified by their vain Com|panions with the Name of <HI>New-Lights,</HI> and Efforts are made to laugh them out of their &s;erious Concern for their Souls and Eternity; which we fear has been the ruinous Ca&s;e of many.</P>
<P>In &s;uch an awful-Scituation of Things as this, we cannot but apprehend that the DIVINE HEAD of the Church now loudly calls <HI>us,</HI> and <HI>all others</HI> who &s;eriou&s;ly believe &amp; are deeply concerned for <HI>tho&s;e great Truths of the Go&s;pel</HI> as collected in the above&s;aid <HI>Catechi&s;m</HI> &amp; <HI>Con|fe&s;&s;ion of Faith,</HI> with the Intere&s;t of <HI>vital Piety;</HI> &mdash; with|out impo&s;ing in the lea&s;t on Others, or a&s;&s;uming any Au|thority over the Con&s;cience of any, which we utterly abhor as directly contrary to the very Nature of Religion it&s;elf; &mdash; <HI>To unite</HI> our <HI>Re&s;olutions</HI> &amp; <HI>Endeavours,</HI> by all proper

Chri&s;t as their Root, before their Fruit can be &s;avoury unto God; that they mu&s;t have a new Principle to ani|mate, and a new End to direct them, before their Actions become gracious and acceptable in the Sight of God: And that they teach them the Nece&s;&s;ity of living by Faith on the Son of God, in a con&s;tant Looking to and Depen|dance on Him, as the great Author of all gracious In|fluences, for the Performance of every Duty: And withal, that after their be&s;t Performances and Attainments, they mu&s;t count them but Lo&s;s and Dung in Point of Justifi|cation before God; and make it their great De&s;ire only ;to be found in Christ and his Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>And that <HI>Mini&s;ters,</HI> in the <HI>Application</HI> of their Ser|mons, do endeavour rightly to divide the Word of Truth, &s;peaking distinctly to &s;uch various Ca&s;es of the <HI>Converted</HI> and <HI>Unconverted,</HI> as ari&s;e natively from the Subjects they have been handling: And that in the whole of their Di&s;cour&s;es, they take care to &s;uit them&s;elves to the Capa|city of their Hearers, as to Matter, Method and Ex|pre&s;&s;ion, and to the prevailing Sins of the Time and Place, with all prudent and zealous Freedom and Plainne&s;s: As al&s;o that they make <HI>Go&s;pel Subjects</HI> their <HI>main Theme</HI> and <HI>Study,</HI> and pre&s;s with all Earne&s;tne&s;s the Practice of moral Duties in a Go&s;pel Manner: And that they forbear delivering any Thing in Publick that may tend more to Amu&s;ement than Edification; and beware of bringing into their Sermons and publick Di&s;cour&s;es Matters of doubtful Di&s;putation, which tend to gender Strife rather than to promote the Edification of Christians. And the A&s;&s;embly exhort all to study to maintain the Unity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace.</P>
<P>And finally, the General A&s;&s;embly recommends to all <HI>Profe&s;&s;ors of Divinity,</HI> to u&s;e their best Endeavours to have the <HI>Students</HI> under their Care, well acquainted with the true Method of Preaching the Go&s;pel, as above di|rected: And that <HI>Pre&s;byteries</HI> at their privy Cen&s;ures inquire concerning the Ob&s;ervation of this Act.</P>

<P>And as the&s;e are our &s;erious Sentiments, Re&s;olutions and De&s;ires, as to the <HI>Doctrines of the Go&s;pel;</HI> we wou'd freely &amp; earne&s;tly invite <HI>all other Mini&s;ters,</HI> who <HI>heartily approve</HI> them, <HI>to unite with us</HI> in <HI>expre&s;&s;ing their Appro|bation of the &s;ame,</HI> both <HI>Tho&s;e who are in the &s;ame Ap|prehen&s;ion</HI> with us in the <HI>late Revival</HI> and <HI>Tho&s;e who are not;</HI> together with <HI>their Re&s;olutions</HI> by the Grace of God to maintain and promote the &s;aid important Truths and Power of Godline&s;s.</P>
<P>Upon the whole; as in all that has been &s;aid, we are far from impo&s;ing our Sentiments on others, as if we intended to exclude them from our Communion or Cha|rity; &s;o we are equally grieved to find &s;ome endeavour|ing to pervert our De&s;ign, as if we aim'd at making <HI>new Creeds</HI> or Te&s;ts of Communion, and others &s;uffer|ing them&s;elves to be impos'd upon by &s;uch an Abu&s;e, which we tru&s;t they will be delivered from by this De|claration.

<P>We conclude with Recommending the following Texts of Scripture to the &s;erious Con&s;ideration both of Mini&s;ters and People on this Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Heb. x. 23. <HI>Let us hold fa&s;t the Profe&s;&s;ion of our Faith without wavering.</HI></P>
<P>Rev. iii. 3, 11. <HI>Remember therefore how thou ha&s;t received and heard, and hold fa&s;t, and repent: Behold I come quickly! hold that fa&s;t which thou ha&s;t, that no Man take thy Crown.</HI></P>
<P>Col. iii. 12&mdash;14. <HI>Put on Bowels of Mercies, kindne&s;s, Hum|blene&s;s of Mind, Meekne&s;s, Long-&s;uffering; forbearing one another, and forgiving one another: If any Man have a Quar|rel again&s;t any; even as</HI> CHRIST <HI>forgave you, &s;o al&s;o do ye. And above all Things, put on Charity, which is the Bond of Perfectne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>1 Pet. iii. 8, 9. <HI>Be ye all of one Mind, having Compa&s;&s;ion one of another; Love as Brethren, be pitiful, be courteous: not rendring Evil for Evil, or Railing for Railing; but con|trariwi&s;e, Ble&s;&s;ing.</HI></P>
<P>Mat. v. 44, 45. <HI>Love your Enemies, ble&s;s them that cur&s;e you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that de&s;pitefully u&s;e you and per&s;ecute you; that you may be the Children of your</HI> FATHER <HI>which is in Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>2 Pet. iii. 17, 18. <HI>Ye therefore Beloved, &s;eeing ye know the&s;e Things before, beware le&s;t ye al&s;o being led away with the Error of the Wicked, fall from your own Stedfa&s;tne&s;s: But grow in Grace and in the Knowledge of our Lord and Saviour</HI> JESUS CHRIST: <HI>To Him be Glory both now and for ever,</HI> AMEN.</P>

<P N="1">(1) <HI>AThei&s;m</HI> &mdash; From <HI>Athei&s;ts:</HI> who deny the Being or Per|fections of GOD, or his Creation or Providence.</P>
<P N="2">(2) <HI>Dei&s;m</HI>&mdash; From <HI>Dei&s;ts:</HI> who tho' they believe the DEITY, yet deny the BIBLE to be given by divine In&s;piration.</P>

<P N="4">(4) <HI>Sociniani&s;m</HI>&mdash;From <HI>Socinus</HI> an <HI>Italian:</HI> who denied GOD's Omni&s;ciency, the Deity of the SON and HOLY GHOST, original Sin, Election, the Satisfaction of CHRIST, the Imputation of his Righteou&s;ne&s;s to our Ju&s;tification, the Operation of the HOLY SPIRIT in our Regeneration; and held that we mu&s;t believe nothing but what our &s;hallow and depraved Rea&s;on comprehends, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="5">(5) <HI>Arminiani&s;m</HI> &mdash; From <HI>Arminius</HI> a <HI>Dutchman:</HI> A Sy&s;tem which holds</P>
<P N="1">I. That the Will of GOD to &s;ave &s;uch as <HI>believe</HI> and <HI>per&s;e|vere</HI> in <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Obedience</HI> is the whole Decree of <HI>Election</HI> to Salvation: that there is one Election to <HI>Faith,</HI> another to <HI>Salvation;</HI> &s;o that Election to <HI>ju&s;tifying Faith</HI> may be without peremptory Election to <HI>Salvation:</HI> that <HI>the good Plea&s;ure and Purpo&s;e of</HI> GOD whereof the Scripture makes mention in the Doctrine of Election, doth not con&s;i&s;t herein,
<PB N="17" REF="005544_0016_10185B1E0C7FA560">
that GOD did elect &s;ome certain Men rather than others; but in this, that GOD from among all po&s;&s;ible Conditions, did chu&s;e as a <HI>Condition</HI> to Salvation, the <HI>Act of Faith</HI> in it &s;elf ignoble, and the <HI>imperfect Obedience of Faith,</HI> and was graciou&s;ly pleas'd to repute it for <HI>perfect Obedience,</HI> and ac|count it worthy of the Reward of everla&s;ting Life: That peremptory Election of &s;ingular Per&s;ons is made by Rea|&s;on of <HI>fore&s;een per&s;evering Faith, Repentance, Sanctity, and Godline&s;s:</HI> that &s;ome who were elected <HI>may</HI> and <HI>do</HI> for ever peri&s;h: and that in this Life there is no Fruit, no Sen&s;e, <HI>no Certainty</HI> of immutable Election unto Glory.</P>
<P N="2">II. That GOD the FATHER ordain'd his SON to the Death of the Cro&s;s, without any certain &amp; determinate Coun&s;el of &s;aving any particular Man expre&s;ly: That CHRIST by his Satisfaction did not certainly merit for any Man <HI>Salvation</HI> and <HI>Faith;</HI> but only purcha&s;ed to his FATHER a Power or plenary Good-will of treating a new with Mankind, and of pre&s;cribing them what new Conditions he plea&s;ed, the Per|formance of which Conditions &s;hould depend on <HI>Man's free Will;</HI> and that therefore it might fall out that either no Man or every Man might fulfill them: That the <HI>New Covenant of Grace</HI> which GOD the FATHER, by the Me|diation of CHRIST's Death, made with Men, doth not con&s;i&s;t herein, viz. that we are ju&s;tified before GOD and &s;aved by <HI>Faith,</HI> as it apprehends the Merit of CHRIST; but herein, viz. that the Exaction of perfect legal Obedience being abrogated, GOD reputes <HI>Faith it&s;elf</HI> and the <HI>imperfect Obedience of Faith</HI> for <HI>perfect Obedience</HI> of the Law, and graciou&s;ly thinks it worthy of the Reward of eternal Life; That all Men are received into the State of Reconciliation and Grace of the Covenant; &s;o that no Body &s;hall be con|demn'd for <HI>Original Sin,</HI> nor in Re&s;pect of it be liable to Death or Damnation, but are all acquitted from the Guilt of that Sin: And whereas &s;ome, rather than others, are made Partakers of Forgivene&s;s of Sins and Life eternal; that this Diver&s;ity depends on <HI>their own Free-Will</HI> applying it&s;elf to Grace indifferently offered, but not upon the <HI>&s;in|gular Gift of Mercy</HI> effectually working in <HI>them</HI> rather than <HI>others,</HI> that they may apply this Grace unto them&s;elves.</P>
<P N="3">III. That <HI>Original Sin</HI> is not of it&s;elf &s;ufficient for the con|demning all Mankind, or de&s;erving temporal and eternal Puni&s;hment: That <HI>the Will</HI> of Man was never corrupted, but only encumbered by the Darkne&s;s of the <HI>Under&s;tanding</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="005544_0017_10181383E4AF8E48">
and Unruline&s;s of the <HI>Affections:</HI> That an <HI>unregenerate</HI> Man is <HI>not properly, nor totally dead in Sins,</HI> nor de&s;titute of all Strength tending to &s;piritual Good&punc; but is able to hunger and thir&s;t after Righteou&s;ne&s;s or everla&s;ting Life, and to offer the Sacrifice of an humble and contrite Heart, even &s;uch as is acceptable to GOD: and that a <HI>corrupt and natural Man</HI> can &s;o rightly u&s;e the Light of Nature, or tho&s;e Gifts which are left in him after the Fall; that by the good U&s;e thereof he may attain to &s;aving Grace and by Degrees at length Salvation it &s;elf.</P>
<P N="4">IV. That in <HI>true Conver&s;ion</HI> there cannot be infu&s;ed by GOD any new Qualities, Habits or Gifts into <HI>the Will</HI> of Man; and &s;o <HI>that Faith</HI> by which we are fir&s;t converted and from which we are &s;tyled Faithful, is not any Quality or Gift infu&s;ed by GOD, but only an Act of Man: That the Grace whereby we are converted to GOD, is nothing el&s;e but a gentle Inducement perform'd by &s;ua&s;ory Motives: That no Cau&s;e can be alledged why even &s;uch moral Grace alone &s;hould not of <HI>natural</HI> Men make <HI>&s;piritual:</HI> That GOD doth not produce the Con&s;ent of our Will otherwi&s;e than by Way of moral Sua&s;ion: That GOD in regenerating a Man, doth not employ that omnipotent Strength, whereby he may powerfully and infallibly bow and bend his Will to Faith and Conver&s;ion: and that in <HI>Conver&s;ion,</HI> Grace does not in order of Cau&s;ality go before the Action of the Will; i. e. that GOD doth not effectually help Man's Will unto Conver&s;ion before the Will of Man moveth and determin|eth or &s;ettleth it &s;elf thereto.</P>
<P N="5">V. That the <HI>Per&s;everance</HI> of the Faithful is not an Effect of Election, or any <HI>Gift of</HI> GOD purcha&s;ed by the Death of CHRIST; but a <HI>Condition</HI> of the <HI>New Covenant,</HI> which is to be perform'd on <HI>Man</HI>'s Part by <HI>his own Free-will</HI> before his peremptory Election and Ju&s;tification: That the <HI>Rege|nerate</HI> may not only totally and finally fall from ju&s;tifying Faith, as al&s;o from Grace and Salvation; but that they do frequently fall from all The&s;e and peri&s;h eternally: That <HI>no Certainty</HI> of future <HI>Per&s;everance</HI> can be had in this Life, without &s;pecial Revelation: That the Doctrine maintaining <HI>A&s;&s;urance</HI> of Per&s;everance and of Salvation, is of its own Nature a &s;oft Pillow for the Fle&s;h, and hurtful to Godline&s;s, good Manners, Praying, and other holy Cour&s;es; and con|trariwi&s;e, that 'tis a very commendable Thing to be doubt|ful of &s;uch Per&s;everance: That <HI>the Faith</HI> of tho&s;e who be|lieve
<PB N="19" REF="005544_0018_10185B1F924D41C8">
but for a Sea&s;on, differs not from ju&s;tifying and &s;aving Faith, but only in Re&s;pect of <HI>Continuance:</HI> That 'tis not ab&s;urd that a Man &s;hould lo&s;e his <HI>fir&s;t Regeneration,</HI> and be again and again Regenerate; and that CHRIST never prayed for Believers infallible Per&s;everance.</P>
