</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE words are cho&s;en in honour of General FISKE, who&s;e elogium I am this day to pronounce. The Scriptures every where pay a tribute to character, in order to pay a ju&s;t tribute to truth. Hi&s;|tory lives in great men, as well as in great events, and it cannot do ju&s;tice to the one, without the other. The mo&s;t &s;imple chro|nology is that of lives; and laws take not plainer dates from the reign of princes, than great actions do from the times of great men. Surely then the &s;ilence will not be required of religion, which truth
<PB N="6" REF="031800_0005_0FEE72E08CC91DF8">has denied to hi&s;tory. We may pay the debt of friend&s;hip, and form the love of vir|tue, in the memory of the dead. The good man will a&s;k no apology, and no other man can de&s;erve one. It is the privilege of virtue to be dear in the recollection, and to have glory from pa&s;t actions.</P>
<P>A peculiar obligation ari&s;es on the pre|&s;ent occa&s;ion, from the di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;er|vices which our departed friend perfor|med for this religious &s;ociety. The &s;pirit of our times had required a change from a pari&s;h, to that of an incorporation of the proprietors in this hou&s;e of wor&s;hip. Other parts of the town enjoyed &s;uch pri|vileges, and many inhabitants were bound by local re&s;idence to &s;upport a mini&s;ter in the pari&s;h, who had other engagements. To obtain a law to di&s;&s;olve the pari&s;h was ea&s;y, but to change the proprietors of the hou&s;e &s;o as to provide &s;uch as were com|petent to the &s;ettlement and &s;upport of a
<PB N="7" REF="031800_0006_0FEF2819D9EB77B0">mini&s;ter, was difficult. The work mu&s;t be accompli&s;hed by &s;low degrees, and in this time, the &s;upport of a mini&s;ter mu&s;t be very precarious. It mu&s;t depend upon generous exertion, and require &s;ome ac|tive friend to per&s;evere in firm, but mild mea&s;ures, till the end was attained. Such was our decea&s;ed friend, and his liberality on the occa&s;ion was unbounded. He was con&s;tant, con&s;i&s;tent, and competent in &s;uch &s;ervices, and attained his wi&s;hes without divi&s;ion, or contention. His en|deavours to e&s;tabli&s;h, what he had &s;o lau|dably a&s;&s;i&s;ted to create, were uniform, till an apoplectic &s;hock di&s;enabled him from any important &s;ervices in our intere&s;t. We may then, with the greate&s;t ju&s;tice, unite with his fellow citizens in comme|morating the event of the pa&s;t week, in the death of an HONOURABLE MAN.</P>
<P>Major General JOHN FISKE was born in this town, on the 10th day of April,
<PB N="8" REF="031800_0007_0FEE72E359A70FF8">1744. His father was mini&s;ter of the fir&s;t church, which was, at his ordination, the only church within the limits of the town. He was a man of eminent talents in the pulpit, of a firm and per&s;evering mind, and of great ambition. He mar|ried into one of the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing fa|milies of the town, and was in very high e&s;teem, till di&s;&s;en&s;ions in the &s;ociety, from the ill defined di&s;cipline of our churches, interrupted the harmony, and prevented his u&s;efulne&s;s. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Samuel Fi&s;ke, ordained October 8, 1718, died in Salem, April 7, 1770, Aet. 81.</NOTE> Among his children, was the gentleman we lament. John was baptized on the 6th of May, by his uncle Nathan Bucknam, of Medway, in the fir&s;t church in Salem. This venerable man, lately decea&s;ed, nearly fini&s;hed a century of years. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">He died, in his charge at Medway, in February, 1795. Aet. 92.</NOTE> Debarred from the hopes of living in the mini&s;try, the Father was obliged to provide for his children in the u&s;ual bu&s;ine&s;s of life, and his &s;on, with a
<PB N="9" REF="031800_0008_0FEE72E62746D710">common education, early engaged in the bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;ea, and having great &s;uc|ce&s;s and happy talents for this employ|ment, he &s;oon became able to obtain pro|motion. He married for the fir&s;t time in June 1766 to a daughter of a Deacon in this church, in whom he found a worthy wife, and the mother of his children. She decea&s;ed in 1782, and he afterwards mar|ried a daughter of Col. Lee of Manche&s;|ter, with whom he lived only two years. He then married his pre&s;ent wife, with whom he lived happily, and from whom he experienced all the kind offices which were &s;o nece&s;&s;ary in the la&s;t years of his life. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He married Lydia Phippen, June 12, 1766, who died October 13, 1782. He married the widow Martha Hibbert, daughter of Col. John Lee, of Manche&s;ter, February 11, 1783, who died No|vember 30, 1785. He then married the widow Sarah Oerry, of Marblehead, daughter of Major John Wendell, of Bo&s;ton, June 18, 1786. His &s;urviving children are Anna, Elizabeth, and John, Elizabeth married Ebenezer Putnam, M. A. &s;on of Ebenezer Put|nam, phy&s;ician, of Salem, lately decea&s;ed. They have one child.</NOTE></P>
<P>Soon after he became ea&s;y in his cir|cum&s;tances,
<PB N="10" REF="031800_0009_0FEE72E8EC3692B0">the American Civil War com|menced. His intrepidity and ambition &s;oon marked him out, as capable of u&s;eful &s;ervices to his country, and he was ap|pointed a commander in the &s;ervice of the State, in one of the ve&s;&s;els then fitted for &s;ea, and held the fir&s;t commi&s;&s;ion. The natural warmth of his temper could never controul the generous &s;entiments of his heart. Even in times of war, he felt the great difference between the liberty of the law, which public exigencies might give to private ve&s;&s;els on the high &s;eas, and the authority it could have in the name of the State to capture ve&s;&s;els of the enemy. Of a commi&s;&s;ion he thought mo&s;t highly, and the mo&s;t generous conduct re&s;ulted from the pride, which this opinion in&s;pired. Our feeble marine force could atchieve nothing greater than to interrupt the trade of the enemy, and this might be done without in&s;ult, and inhumanity. At the clo&s;e of the war, he e&s;tabli&s;hed him&s;elf as
<PB N="11" REF="031800_0010_0FEE72EBAE8A7978">a merchant. As he ro&s;e in life, from the employments of navigation, he connected his character as a merchant, immediately with &s;hips in commerce, and extended his voyages, as the enterpri&s;ing &s;pirit of the times, and his own ambition led him, and had he not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed from early life an un|common genero&s;ity, he mu&s;t have ri&s;en to as &s;plendid wealth, as has ever been en|joyed in our country. In his bu&s;ine&s;s, he &s;oon became di&s;tingui&s;hed by his generous encouragement to all whom he employed. He never appeared more &s;incerely happy, than when the ma&s;ters of his ve&s;&s;els grew rich, and never di&s;covered more earne&s;t de|&s;ires, than to promote &s;uch as had been faithful in his employment. Punctuality with the trade&s;men, he mo&s;t highly valued, and his contracts were generous, never op|pre&s;&s;ive, and &s;eldom of le&s;s than equal ad|vantage, to all who formed them. He carefully ob&s;erved an annual &s;ettlement and arrangement of all his affairs, and no
<PB N="12" REF="031800_0011_0FEE72EE703C34A0">merchant could provide more amply for the accuracy of his papers, or the order and ju&s;t &s;eries of his books of account. And he &s;uffered no per&s;ons to be engaged in this &s;ervice, who had not adequate hopes of advantage from their fidelity. No man therefore could be more loved by his clerks and ma&s;ters. All are ready to atte&s;t the warmth of affection, which they have di&s;|covered.</P>
<P>His bu&s;ine&s;s kept him from any thoughts of civil offices in the &s;tate, but no man ever paid greater veneration to the &s;ervants of the people. He always &s;pake of places of tru&s;t, as offices of the highe&s;t honour, and he religiou&s;ly guarded again&s;t the li|berty to extend the cen&s;ure of a bad man, to any office he might hold in the &s;tate. Our chief magi&s;trates, our judges, and men of every office found him re&s;pectful to all the honours, which the &s;tate could confer, and di&s;covered that &s;uch honours
<PB N="13" REF="031800_0012_0FEE72F2750F9288">were &s;ure claims of the highe&s;t attention from his enlightened patrioti&s;m.</P>
<P>But though confined by his attention to bu&s;ine&s;s, in his wi&s;hes of civil promotion, no man was more attentive to the police, and the pro&s;perity of the town, in which he lived. As an officer of the town he was always u&s;eful; always ready; and always employed. In the admini&s;tration of the public charities, no man contributed more to the mo&s;t happy arrangements, to the kinde&s;t attentions, and to the general &s;ati&s;|faction of the poor. No part of the eco|nomy was forgotten by him. Every thing pa&s;&s;ed before his own eyes. He entered into the condition and claims of the lowe&s;t, and was as punctual and faithful, as in his own highe&s;t concerns. Upon the occa|&s;ional contributions in the Congregation, he has been known to a&s;&s;i&s;t liberally in the collection; to have added repeatedly in the arrangements; and then again in the
<PB N="14" REF="031800_0013_0FEE72F4038C9990">di&s;tribution, and has then &s;aid, "It is in|deed more than u&s;ual, but while one want is un&s;upplied, it is not enough."</P>
<P>For the Schools he always expre&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t &s;acred regard, and he was very active in obtaining that late e&s;tabli&s;hment, from which the town derives &s;o much honour, and &s;o general &s;atisfaction. He in&s;pected the building of the new Schools, and encouraged with great zeal the public Schools for the in&s;truction of Females. He always had an high opinion of the im|portant tru&s;t of a Schoolma&s;ter, and there|fore always was zealous for the mo&s;t am|ple compen&s;ation of their labours. The Schoolma&s;ters have lo&s;t a di&s;tingui&s;hed be|nefactor. The exemplary indu&s;try, and ju&s;t economy of this town, had &s;ubjected it to fal&s;e charges re&s;pecting its ho&s;pitality. The &s;ilent and re&s;erved manners &s;o natural to its employments, and to a town, which has &s;o very little inland trade, had given
<PB N="15" REF="031800_0014_0FEE72F6BB7730B8">occa&s;ion to &s;uch reports. It was the duty of men, who could unite with application to bu&s;ine&s;s, happy opportunities for lei&s;ure, to remove ungenerous prejudices. For this duty, our friend was eminently quali|fied. The habits of bu&s;ine&s;s were ea&s;y to him, and his affairs were well arranged, while his love of &s;ociety had never been impaired by his great indu&s;try and activity. He therefore opened his hou&s;e to the wor|thy of all nations. He received vi&s;its freely from all &s;trangers, recommended to him, and &s;earched out the wants of all, who entered the town. In his exten&s;ive &s;er|vices to men of every rank and de&s;cription, he remains unequalled.</P>
<P>He had been always taught to a&s;&s;ociate the influence of good morals with religious in&s;titutions of public in&s;truction, and therefore at public wor&s;hip he was con|&s;tant. No excu&s;es &s;ufficed for him. But with religious opinions he had formed no
<PB N="16" REF="031800_0015_0FEE72F976B109A0">enmities. He never thought men, who differed from him, were fools or knaves. He had a per&s;ua&s;ion that religious opinions depend not on names, but upon &s;incere inquiry, for their be&s;t influence, and that an hone&s;t mind might be &s;o circum&s;tanced, as to admit the mo&s;t ab&s;urd doctrines, and be uncharitable in the defence of them, while there might be great benevolence in the native purpo&s;es of the heart. He therefore loved all men, who acted in &s;in|cerity, and never found his own heart le&s;s &s;en&s;ible, nor his hand le&s;s ready, from the opinions, condition, or prejudices of any men. Few men can pre&s;erve this genero|&s;ity of mind, with greater freedom from caprice. No ha&s;ty expre&s;&s;ion was hard to recall, and no fudden purpo&s;e was &s;uffi|cient to check his bounty; and when he acted, he was &s;ure to do what was honour|able. He felt the claims of humanity ri&s;|ing above all the di&s;tinctions of civil life, and he had one law for all mankind.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="031800_0016_0FEE72FC414F8A70">
The kind opinion of his fellow citizens marked him out for all the honours they could confer. His promotion was una|voidable. They knew his ambition to give the highe&s;t &s;ucce&s;s to all his under|takings, and could not refu&s;e to urge him to many important &s;ervices. The &s;tate of the militia, the boa&s;t, as it ought to be the defence of Republics, then under many di&s;couragements, required a man of per&s;e|verance, and bold exertion. The laws of the militia were examined with great pre|judices, and the contrary opinions all tended to in&s;ubordination. A man of a di&s;intere&s;ted &s;pirit was nece&s;&s;ary to quiet the public mind, and to overrule prejudices in regard to a &s;ubject upon which the pub|lic &s;en&s;e is not yet determined. After his public appearance he &s;oon ro&s;e to the highe&s;t pre&s;erment. He became Colonel of the Regiment in 1788. In July 1789 he was elected, and commi&s;&s;ioned Briga|dier General, and in 1792 became Major
<PB N="18" REF="031800_0017_0FEE72FEF9957C50">General. Under his patronage began an a&s;&s;ociation of the Military Officers, which has been very favourable to private friend|&s;hip, as well as conducive to the ambition of a military command, while it much increa&s;ed the di&s;po&s;ition for the nece&s;&s;ary &s;ubordination.</P>
<P>While employed in organi&s;ing and en|couraging the militia, he was not forgot|ten by the merchants, and the members of the Marine Society. This in&s;titution, de|&s;igned for the charitable a&s;&s;i&s;tance of di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed mariners and their families, embra|ced al&s;o the liberal de&s;ign of promoting every thing u&s;eful to navigation, and of pre&s;erving and communicating all di&s;co|veries and occurrences on the voyages of the members, as well as of receiving all plans to facilitate the navigation of this port. The Marine Society was formed in 1766, revi&s;ed its laws in 1784, and again corrected them in 1790. After the death
<PB N="19" REF="031800_0018_0FEE7301C0779548">of that worthy man, Captain Jonathan Gardner, in 1791, our friend was appoint|ed his &s;ucce&s;&s;our, as Pre&s;ident, or Ma&s;ter of the Society. Under &s;o active an officer, its &s;pirit revived. It was not long after the appointment, convenient piers were rai&s;ed to guard again&s;t the dangers and the delays of a narrow and &s;hallow channel to our wharves, and the &s;tately beacon &s;oon appeared at the entrance of the harbour, which promoted from its known utility, the petition for the new light hou&s;e al|ready erected. The funds have increa&s;ed, and this Society is now one of the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing and reputable in the State.</P>
<P>But to teach us the uncertain pro&s;pects of life, while he was projecting the bolde&s;t de&s;igns for the pro&s;perity of Salem, he had a &s;troke of apoplexy, which put an end to his u&s;efulne&s;s. The evil had &s;o affected the brain in June 1795, that the hopes of recovery were lo&s;t. It was attended with
<PB N="20" REF="031800_0019_0FEE73047A0A8D10">great lo&s;s of memory, and with great ab|&s;ence of mind, when he fir&s;t awoke from &s;leep, and increa&s;ed into an entire derange|ment. But in his mo&s;t deranged &s;tate, he was full of great de&s;igns for mankind, and never betrayed a narrow thought, or one ungenerous purpo&s;e on any occa&s;ion. The aid of phy&s;icians in town and country was &s;ought in vain, and the &s;hocks were repeated, till an entire debility en&s;ued, and at la&s;t the powers of &s;peech failed, and in a violent fit of apoplexy, he expired at two o'clock on Thur&s;day la&s;t, the 28th day of September.</P>
<P>Various cau&s;es have been a&s;&s;igned, of a calamity, which arre&s;ted a man, of &s;o ap|parently firm con&s;titution, in the mid&s;t of his hopes and u&s;efulne&s;s. But the effects do not &s;o well corre&s;pond with the events, which occurred in his dome&s;tic circum&s;tan|ces, and his &s;ecular concerns, as to per|&s;uade us, that they were the remote, or
<PB N="21" REF="031800_0020_0FEE7307401DD8A0">immediate cau&s;es of his &s;ufferings. The repeated breaches in his family, and the depredations on his property at &s;ea, un|doubtedly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed him, but his natural cheerfulne&s;s, and the property he &s;till po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed, relieved him from the wor&s;t appre|hen&s;ions. From an intimate acquaintance, and an impartial inquiry, and from daily ob&s;ervation, it may be pre&s;umed, and from the hi&s;tory of his family and con&s;titution, that what he &s;uffered aro&s;e from no moral cau&s;e, and from no anxiety of mind, but from the nature of that di&s;order, which has &s;o often arre&s;ted the be&s;t and mo&s;t active men, and which did arre&s;t on the pa&s;t week a worthy gentleman of the &s;ame rank at the head of his divi&s;ion, and in the public di&s;charge of his duty. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. Hull at the review in Concord. He has &s;ince recovered of this &s;hock.</NOTE></P>
<P>High as may be our e&s;teem of him in his public offices, we &s;hall not value him
<PB N="22" REF="031800_0021_0FEE730B286965E0">le&s;s, when we ob&s;erve his di&s;po&s;ition in dome&s;tic life. In his fir&s;t years, he was called to repay the cares of his aged pa|rents, when he might have hoped to pro|vide for his own advancement. The joy as well as fidelity with which he di&s;charged this duty, is well known, and has been the &s;ubject of many a prophecy among the aged, re&s;pecting God's ble&s;&s;ings upon him Such an ingenuous affection di&s;plays his worth in an unequivocal manner.</P>
<P>As an Hu&s;band, he pa&s;&s;ed in quick &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion through various &s;cenes, all of which were adapted to explain the firm habits of his mind. In the wife of his youth, he had &s;weet endearment. The &s;hort &s;cene of gay, and fond life, which &s;ucceeded, &s;erved to fix his love of &s;ocial joy, and the amiable virtues of his la&s;t companion were rich ble&s;&s;ings upon the la&s;t &s;cene of his u&s;eful|ne&s;s, and in the hours which called for &s;ympathy, fidelity, and the &s;evere&s;t duty.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="031800_0022_0FEE730CAFC42640">
Of &s;ympathy he felt all the cruelty, and yet he commanded all the virtue. His children were dear to him. They ro&s;e into life, but peri&s;hed at the hour they ripened. An accompli&s;hed daughter of his hopes completed her education, and returned to her parents, to embrace them, and to die. He &s;aw the fond mother in one of his chil|dren, and found another home, but this expectation was &s;oon lo&s;t. The mother and the babes &s;oon pa&s;&s;ed to the &s;ilence of the grave. Yet another &s;miled on the world, and bid a &s;peedy farewell in youth and innocence. In the&s;e &s;cenes, he was tender, yet re&s;igned. He with increa&s;ed affection united to tho&s;e who remained with him, and as the circle became &s;mall, he filled it more with his pre&s;ence and his love. His manners were kind, and fami|liar, and commanded re&s;pect. He was fond, ea&s;ily excited to pity, but had a dig|nity in his tears. Superiour to complaint, he li&s;tened to the complaints of other men,
<PB N="24" REF="031800_0023_0FEE30A7959FCC10">and engaged their confidence. Without fraud, his language &s;eldom required an ex|planation, and did not admit concealed purpo&s;es of evil. He never valued his friend&s;hip, till he had proved it, and never believed his own &s;incerity, till he had di&s;|charged every obligation. Ju&s;tice with him was all the good in his power. He was fond of favour, but he endeavoured to de&s;erve it. He loved men, rather than opinions, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He profe&s;&s;ed the Unitarian doctrine.</NOTE> and he de&s;ired to know more of their actions, than of ther profe&s;&s;ions. As a ju&s;t tribute, it may be &s;aid, that in his friend&s;hips, he was con&s;tant. Few men, &s;o much in the world, knew &s;o little of being in and out of favour. No re&s;ent|ment made him deny any man's merit, and no enmity made him refu&s;e to &s;erve him. He blamed errour only when per|&s;i&s;ted in. He made it the intere&s;t of his friends to for&s;ake it, and judged of their &s;incerity by their actions. No explana|tions
<PB N="25" REF="031800_0024_0FEE730E37ED2768">debarred them from a return. He lived and died, as truly as any man ever did, the friend of all mankind.</P>
<P>We freely inquire re&s;pecting the per&s;on of a man, whom we are taught to love. General Fi&s;ke, in his per&s;on, was of fine proportions; hand&s;ome; in his manners ea&s;y; had a dignity in his motions, and could command re&s;pect. He had a benevo|lence in his countenance, while his eye was lofty, quick, and expre&s;&s;ive. In his con|ver&s;ation, he was often impetuous; but &s;oon calmed. Always &s;ure of his motives, he was able to correct his natural fire from the heart. He never concealed his faults, confe&s;&s;ed them, but ro&s;e above them by great virtues. When mo&s;t zealous, he was mo&s;t benevolent, and he could never be &s;udden, but when he had purpo&s;es of in|&s;tant good in his actions. His &s;teps, his &s;oul in&s;tantly partook of all his emotions, and he was all in every thing. His ambi|tion
<PB N="26" REF="031800_0025_0FEE731252A67D88">was never dangerous, for it had no guilt. His fondne&s;s for prai&s;e, made him de&s;erve it, and his plea&s;ures were purely &s;ocial. In his con&s;titution he was firm, in his natural &s;trength great, in his mu&s;|cles athletic. The conformation of his face had &s;trong lines, but he could not long pre&s;erve any angry emotion. He di&s;|covered his &s;oul in his per&s;on, as much as in his actions.</P>
<P>When we con&s;ider the benefits, which mankind have derived from the benevo|lent, we are convinced, that it is in the or|der of divine providence, to accompli&s;h the be&s;t de&s;igns for men, by the generous, and enlightened few, who appear in the &s;ucce&s;|&s;ive ages of the world. No man has been able to exhibit that equality of talents, which qualifies all men to be equally u&s;e|ful, enterpri&s;ing and &s;ucce&s;sful in any &s;tate of &s;ociety. Such circum&s;tances mu&s;t com|bine, &s;uch habits be formed, and &s;uch ge|nerous
<PB N="27" REF="031800_0026_0FEE731657F5E170">zeal mu&s;t exi&s;t, as can command the pa&s;&s;ions of mankind. In every coun|try, in every pur&s;uit, in every thing excel|lent, this has been the privilege of few men, and therefore it may be con&s;idered as a peculiar ble&s;&s;ing to any &s;ociety, when &s;uch men are allied to its intere&s;t. Such indi&s;putably was the friend whom we have this day in grateful remembrance, and whom we in the pa&s;t week, followed, with the highe&s;t honours, to the tomb. To commemorate real worth, is to create it. Great examples develope character, and in&s;pire virtue. The prophet celebrated in the text, was thus honourable. He knew the people were ignorant and corrupt; that a di&s;po&s;ition for change was not to be re&s;i&s;ted; that he was in danger from envy, competition, and intere&s;t. That the &s;afe path to pre&s;ent ea&s;e was by flattery, con&s;ent, and conformity. Had he yielded, he could not have uttered that generous appeal by which he has been rendered im|mortal.
<PB N="28" REF="031800_0027_0FEE7317E6922D10">Hi&s;tory could not have reported any thing great or honourable of &s;uch a man. He therefore yielded to the generous purpo&s;es of his own heart. He did every good thing in his power. He was crown|ed with the love, and rewarded with the pro&s;perity of an whole nation. May we never forget the richne&s;s of the reward, or the glory of the &s;ervice.</P>
<P>In &s;uch recitals, the &s;criptures are true to hi&s;tory. In all enlightened nations, &s;uch names are recorded at every eventful period. Con&s;ult even the hi&s;tory of the church. FATHERS have been reverenced in the primitive ages. We give this name to eminent men. If &s;uper&s;tition has at|tached it&s;elf to great names, it is not be|cau&s;e men have been ungrateful, but be|cau&s;e they were not philo&s;ophers. If men have reverenced great, though perverted talents, it was becau&s;e they knew more of great talents, than of truth. The mo&s;t
<PB N="29" REF="031800_0028_0FEE73196FDA7918">memorable &s;uper&s;tition is ignorance grate|ful to reward great zeal in the &s;ervice of mankind. In the reformation, we cele|brate the &s;ucce&s;sful labours of men, indig|nant at oppre&s;&s;ion. There have been as great men &s;ince, and more enlightened. When men are determined to do good, God always &s;ays, it &s;hall pro&s;per.</P>
<P>But why &s;hould we &s;earch antient re|cords? Why &s;hould we explore di&s;tant re|gions? The world is but one volume, and our own country has in&s;tructive pages open to our view. Our fathers boldly en|terpri&s;ed. We re&s;pect their names with gratitude. They have left no monuments, but in the memory of their labours. Their &s;ons have ari&s;en, have enlightened and in|&s;tructed their country. Every where, there has been virtue, and glory. A father has begun a &s;ettlement, and has given his name, his character, and his hopes to all around him. In the &s;tate, the city, and
<PB N="30" REF="031800_0029_0FEE731D67D9FB08">the field, men ari&s;e to en&s;ure the rewards of public gratitude. We are not without ex|amples in all our various communities. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The funeral di&s;cour&s;es lately printed in this county, upon the death of the Hon. Azor Orne, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR>. of Marblehead, and of Col. John Low, of Glouce&s;ter, expre&s;s the public &s;entiment.</NOTE> The obligations are univer&s;ally known. A di&s;play of genius, is the developement of the human powers, by the force of circum|&s;tances in which they are placed. We &s;ee not the full &s;trength of every man's capa|city, nor do we &s;uppo&s;e, that the man di&s;|tingui&s;hed in &s;ome circum&s;tances, would have been eminent in all. A great man ari&s;|es, and he diffu&s;es light around him. He kindles up new &s;uns to &s;hine with native &s;plendour, and genius has its glory. So a man of generous goodne&s;s gives his faire&s;t character to the regions in which he has his habitation. This is confirmed in the hi&s;tory of the human mind. One mind <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Locke.</NOTE> employed on the human under&s;tanding,
<PB N="31" REF="031800_0030_0FEE73215B9AECD0">has given exalted wi&s;dom to this divine philo&s;ophy. The <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Newton.</NOTE> principles of a philo|&s;opher have di&s;clo&s;ed the laws of nature. The pulpit <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Age of Louis XIV.</NOTE> was in&s;tructed in the la&s;t age, and humanity <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Howard.</NOTE> in the pre&s;ent. We all know the date of the&s;e events, when we commence our &s;tudies. Common minds follow up the&s;e eminent men to their la&s;t di&s;coveries, and if they cannot pa&s;s be|yond, they make familiar the path, which has been opened. So when a good exam|ple of life has been fairly exhibited, with|out any &s;tretch of the human powers, men advance freely, and po&s;&s;e&s;s the be&s;t attain|ments. Not half the labour is required to render men wi&s;e, which was nece&s;&s;ary to confirm them in errour and ignorance.</P>
<P>And may we not confirm the &s;ame hi&s;|tory of the virtues? One man teaches an whole nation to be brave. One man diffu|&s;es a &s;pirit of indu&s;try around him. One
<PB N="32" REF="031800_0031_0FEE7322E682CF78">man forms a love of order, and of peace. There is no virtue, which cannot di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s the mo&s;t inveterate errours, when it is e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in &s;ome great example. Men be|come proud of the imitation. Cruel is the attempt to confine them to the mea&s;ure of &s;canty virtue. When they copy in &s;trength of de&s;ire, they produce with &s;ure &s;ucce&s;s, the highe&s;t virtues of our nature. It is enough to know where men live, under what influence they are directed, to know what is the mea&s;ure of their hopes and of their virtues.</P>
<P>And mu&s;t not then the progre&s;s of &s;ocie|ty depend upon generous minds? The half taught parent mu&s;t err in the mo&s;t &s;imple le&s;&s;ons of truth. The mind of the child cannot be happily expanded. The unqualified in&s;tructor delays the vi&s;its of knowledge till &s;ome future generation. The darkne&s;s of his own mind prevents truth from &s;hining upon the world. But
<PB N="33" REF="031800_0032_0FEE732879DD7230">when his under&s;tanding is clear, he rai&s;es men to his own attainments, and grand elevation. They ri&s;e then with greater ea&s;e, than they could have grovelled below. This truth is not only clear, but momen|tous. It is too much forgotten in the fooli&s;h &s;atisfaction with pa&s;t ignorance.</P>
<P>And &s;hall not we take a le&s;&s;on from this truth, as illu&s;trated in the example of our friend? We have &s;een a generous man. We knew his &s;ervices, and we confe&s;s his influence. Should we ever de&s;cend to things which are mean, we &s;hall act unwor|thy of the mo&s;t ju&s;t expectations. It is an happy reflection that our friend found ample &s;upport in &s;ome men, who po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;ame virtues. We tru&s;t that they will continue to recommend the laudable prin|ciples they have adopted. May they act upon their enlightened under&s;tandings, and while they remember the good things in their power, may they be in love with their highe&s;t duty.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="031800_0033_0FEE732B3AC85318">
Con&s;ider the worth of our departed friend, and then can you wonder at our tears? Can you expect that we &s;hould have the la&s;t &s;ight of our deare&s;t friend, and not weep? that after an intimate ac|quaintance, con&s;tant &s;ervices, and uniform affection, we &s;hould forget the man, who has done &s;o much to make us happy, and &s;hould &s;eparate without angui&s;h? We are not &s;o taught by our pure&s;t affections. Nor do we expect to be for&s;aken in our tears. Many will crowd around us, to partake in our &s;orrows. They will know our lo&s;s, and mourn with us the death of an HONOURABLE MAN. They who have been a&s;&s;i&s;ted, while entering into life, and have experienced the care of a benefactor, they will lament the man who &s;o heartily rejoiced in their pro&s;perity. The poor will remember that they are no longer to be|hold him, who has &s;o often admini&s;tered relief to their wants. The mariner will think of him, who has &s;o often &s;ent charity
<PB N="35" REF="031800_0034_0FEE732E0D3F8A60">to the hou&s;e, from which the hu&s;band was ab&s;ent, or to which he could never return. While the &s;oldier will pa&s;s in thought, over the joy, which his general and his friend could in&s;pire. Every good man will mourn, when the friends of public happi|ne&s;s for&s;ake the world. But whatever re|flections good men may indulge upon the melancholy changes of human life, they who have lived in the intimate affections mu&s;t di&s;charge the duties of the &s;evere&s;t &s;ympathy. We condole, in &s;incerity, with the bereaved widow, who is &s;eparated from the man, &s;he loved. Her piety, her exem|plary patience, and her &s;ublime hopes will carry her to her God. The more rich our gifts, the greater the duty of re&s;ignation. Religion exalts the duty, while the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ings form the &s;evere&s;t obligation. We compa&s;&s;ionate an aged relative, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Madam King, &s;i&s;ter of his mother, and living in his family.</NOTE> who has &s;hared his love, and found in his hou&s;e, a quiet habitation. We pity an infirm bro|ther,
