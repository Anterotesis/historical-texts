<P>A Little before in this Chapter, you may read. That the Lord Je&s;us walked on the Sea, to go to <HI>Capernaum,</HI> having &s;ent his Di&s;ciples before in a Ship, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> but the Wind was contrary, by which means the Ship was hindred in her Pa&s;&s;age. Now, a|bout the fourth watch of the Night&punc; Je&s;us came walking upon the Sea, and overtok them&punc; at the &s;ight of whom they were afraid,</P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> When Providences are black and terri|ble to God's People, the Lord Je&s;us &s;hews him|&s;elf to them in a wonderful Manner; which &s;ometimes they can as little bear, as they can the things that were before terrible to them. They were afraid of the Wind &amp; Water; they we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e al&s;o afraid of their Lord &amp; Saviour, when he appeared to them in that &s;tate.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> he &s;aid, Be not afraid, it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> That the End of the appearing of the Lord Je&s;us unto his People, (though the manner of his appearing be never &s;o terrible) is to al|lay their Fears and Perplexities.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="003002_0003_0FEF964002C7AB80">Then they received him into the Ship, &amp; im|mediately the Ship was at Land whither it went.</P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> When Chri&s;t is ab&s;ent from his People, they go on but &s;lowly &amp; with great difficulty; but when he joineth him&s;elf unto them; Oh! how fa&s;t they &s;teer their Cour&s;e; how &s;oon are they at their Journeys end.</P>
<P>The People now, among whom he la&s;t Preach|ed, when they &s;aw that both Je&s;us was gone &amp; his Di&s;ciples, they al&s;o took Shipping, &amp; came to <HI>Capernaum,</HI> &s;eeking for Je&s;us. And when they had found him, they wondringly ask'd him, <HI>Rab|bi, When came&s;t thou hither?</HI> But the Lord Je&s;us &s;lighting their Complement, an&s;wer'd, <HI>Verily, ve|rily, ye &s;eek me not, becau&s;e ye &s;aw the Miracles, but becau&s;e ye did eat of the Loaves, and were filled.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> A People may follow Chri&s;t far, for ba&s;e Ends, as the&s;e went after him beyond Sea for Loaves: A Man's Belly may carry him a great way in Religion; yea, a Man's Belly will make him venture far for Chri&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Note</HI> again, They are not feigning Comple|ments, but gracious Intentions, that crown the Work in the Eye of Chri&s;t: Or thus, It is not the Toil &amp; Bu&s;ine&s;s of Profe&s;&s;ors, but their Love to him, that makes him approve of them.</P>
<P><HI>Note</HI> again, When Men &s;hall look for friend|ly Entertainment at Chri&s;t's Hand, (if their Hearts be rotten) even then will they mee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> with a Check and Rebuke, <HI>Ye &s;eek me not becau&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ye &s;aw the Miracles, but becau&s;e ye did eat of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oaves and were filled.</HI></P>

that come to him with Pretences only, come to him &s;incerely, that they may be &s;aved.</P>
<P>The <HI>Text,</HI> you will find, is after much more Di&s;cour&s;e with, &amp; about this People; and it is uttered by the Lord Je&s;us, at the Conclu&s;ion of the whole; &amp; intimateth, that &s;ince they were Profe&s;&s;ors in Patience only, &amp; therefore &s;uch as his Soul could not delght in, as &s;uch, that he would content him&s;elf with a Remnant that his Father had be&s;towed upon him. As if he &s;hould &s;ay, I am not like to be honour'd in your Salvation; but the Father hath be&s;towed upon me a Peeple, &amp; they &s;hall come to me in Truth, &amp; in them will I be &s;atisfy'd. <HI>The Text</HI> before may be called Chri&s;t's Repo&s;e; in the fulfilling whereof he re&s;ted him&s;elf content, after much Labour, and many Sermons &s;pent, as i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> were in vain. As he &s;aith by the Prophet, <HI>I have laboured in vain, I have &s;pent my &s;trength for n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ught, and in vain,</HI> I&s;a. 49.4.</P>
<P>But as he &s;aith there, <HI>My Judgment is with the Lord, and my Work with my God:</HI> So in the Text he &s;aith; <HI>All that the Father giveth me, &s;hall come to me, and him that cometh to me, I will in no wi&s;e c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> out.</HI> By the&s;e Words therefore, the Lord Je&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> comforteth him&s;elf under the Con&s;ideration of the Di&s;&s;imulation of &s;ome of his Followers. He al&s;o thus betook him&s;elf to re&s;t under the Con|&s;ideration of the little effect that his Mini&s;try <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ad in <HI>Capernaum, Corazin</HI> &amp; <HI>Bet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">da&punc; I thank once, O Father,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>Lord of Heaven and Earth, becau&s;e thou ha&s;t hid the&s;e things from the Wi&s;e are Prudent, and ha&s;t revealed them to Babes, even &s;o, Fa|ther, for &s;o it &s;eemed good in thy fight.</HI> Mat. 11.25.

<P>The fir&s;t part of the Text (as is evident) re&s;pecteth the Father, &amp; his Gift; the other part, the Son, and the Reception of his Gift.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> For the Gift of the Father, there is this to be Con&s;idered; <HI>to wit,</HI></P>
<P>The Gift it &s;elf; and that is a Gift of cer|tain Per&s;ons to the Son. The Father giveth, and that Gift &s;hall come: And him that co|meth: The Gift then is of Per&s;ons; The Fa|ther giveth Per&s;ons to Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly</HI> Next you have the Son's Reception of this Gift, and that it &s;heweth it &s;elf in the&s;e Particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. In the hearty Acknowledgment of it to be a Gift: <HI>The Father giveth me.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. In his Re&s;olution to bring them to Him|&s;elf; <HI>All that the Father giveth Me, &s;hall come to Me.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. And in his determining, that not any thing &s;hall make him di&s;like them in their coming: <HI>And him that cometh to me, I will in no wi&s;e ca&s;t out.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e things might be &s;poken to at large, as they are in this Method pre&s;ented to view; but I &s;hall choo&s;e to &s;peak to the&s;e Words;</P>

<P N="2">2. It mu&s;t not be taken for all that, in any &s;en&s;e, are given by the Father to him; becau&s;e
<PB N="7" REF="003002_0005_0FEF9A2CDD880730">
the Father hath given &s;ome, yea, many to him to be da&s;h'd in pieces by him. <HI>Ask of me</HI> &s;aid the Father to him, <HI>and I will give thee the Hea|then for thine Inheritance, and the uttermo&s;t parts of the Earth for thy Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</HI> But what mu&s;t be done with them?

This Method he u&s;eth not with them that he &s;aveth by his Grace, but with tho&s;e that Him|&s;elf and Saints &s;hall rule over in Ju&s;tice &amp; Se|verity, <HI>Rev</HI> 2.26, 27. Yet, as you &s;ee, they are given to him. Therefore the Gift intended in the Text, mu&s;t be re&s;trained to &s;ome; to a Gift that is given by way of &s;pecialty by the Father to the Son.</P>
<P>In <HI>P&s;al</HI> 18 He &s;aith plainly, that &s;ome are given to him, that he might de&s;troy them; <HI>Thou ha&s;t given me the Necks of mine Enemies, that I might de&s;troy them that hate me,</HI> ver. 40. The&s;e therefore cannot be of the Number of tho&s;e that are &s;aid to be given in the Text; for tho&s;e, even <HI>all</HI> of them, &s;hall come to him, and he <HI>will in no wi&s;e ca&s;t them out.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Some are given to Chri&s;t, that he by them might bring about &s;ome of his high and deep De&s;igns in the World. Thus <HI>Judas</HI> was given to Chri&s;t, <HI>viz</HI> That by him, even as he was de|termined before, he might bring about his Death, &amp; &s;o the Salvation of his Elect by his Blood. Yea, and <HI>Judas</HI> mu&s;t &s;o manage this Bu&s;ine&s;s, as that he may lo&s;e him&s;elf for ever in bringing it &s;o to pa&s;s: Therefore the Lord Je|&s;us, even in his lo&s;ing of <HI>Judas,</HI> applies him&s;elf to the Judgment of his Father, if he had not in that thing done that which was right, even

<P><HI>Tho&s;e</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>that thou gave&s;t me have I kept, and none of them is lo&s;t but the Son of Perdition, that the Scripture might be fulfilled,</HI> John 17.12. Let us then grant that <HI>Judas</HI> was given to Chri&s;t, but not as others are given to him; nor of tho&s;e made mention of in the Text; for then he &s;hould have failed to have been &s;o received by Chri&s;t, and kept to eternal Life. Indeed he was given to Chri&s;t, but he was given to him to lo&s;e him in the way that I have mentioned be|fore; he was given to Chri&s;t, that he by him might bring about his own death, as was before determin'd, &amp; that in the overthrow of him that did it. Yea, he mu&s;t bring about his own Death, as was before determin'd; and that in the overthrow of him that did it: Yea, he mu&s;t bring about his Dying for us, in the lo&s;s of the In&s;trument that betray'd him; that he might even fulfil the Scripture in his De&s;truction, as well as in the Salvation of the re&s;t. <HI>And none of them is lo&s;t, but the Son of Perdi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">on&punc; that the Scripture might be fulfilled.</HI></P>
<P>The Gift therefore in the Text mu&s;t not be taken in the large&s;t Sen&s;e, but even as the Words will bear, <HI>viz.</HI> For &s;uch a Gift as he accepteth, and promi&s;eth to be an effectual means of E|ternal Salvation to. <HI>All that the Father giveth Me, &s;hall come to Me; and him that cometh to Me, I will in no wi&s;e ca&s;t out.</HI> Mark! They &s;hall come that are in &s;pecial given to Me; and they &s;hall by no means be rejected; For this is the Sub|&s;tance of the Text.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e therefore intended, as the Gift in the

<P>The&s;e be they that the Father hath given to Chri&s;t to keep them; tho&s;e that Chri&s;t hath pro|mi&s;ed eternal Life unto; tho&s;e to whom he hath given his Word, and that he will have with him in hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Kingdom, to behold his Glory.</P>

Wherefore in tho&s;e other places, when this Gift is mentioned, it is &s;till &s;poken of as an Act that is pa&s;s: As, <HI>All that he hath given me?

Things pa&s;t, or things to come, are always pre&s;ent with God, &amp; with his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t: He calleth things that are not, (that is to us) as though they were. And again, <HI>Known unto God are all his Works from the Foundation of the World.

<P>Further, Here is &s;omething implied that is not expre&s;&s;ed, <HI>to wit,</HI> that the Father hath not given all Men to Chri&s;t; that is, in the &s;en&s;e as is intended in the Text; tho' in a larger, as was before, <HI>He hath given him every one of them</HI>; for then all &s;hould be &s;aved: He hath therefore di&s;po&s;ed of &s;ome another way.

<P>So that to move in thy Mind and Will after Chri&s;t, is to be coming to him.

<P>I an&s;wer, poor, helple&s;s, mi&s;erable Sinners <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">articularly.</P>

<P><HI>Freely,</HI> without Money, or without Price. <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI>!

<P><HI>But Thirdly,</HI> This Doctrine of Coming to <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> for Life, informeth us, That it is to be had no where el&s;e; might it be had any where el&s;e? the Text and him that &s;pake it, would be but little &s;et by; for what greater matter is there, in I will in no wi&s;e ca&s;t out, if another &s;tood by that would receive them? But here appears the Glory of Chri&s;t, that none but he can &s;ave And here appears his Love, that though none can &s;ave but <HI>He,</HI> yet he is not Coy in Saving; But him that comes to me &s;ayshel will in no wi&s;e ca&s;t him out</P>
<P>That none can &s;ave but <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> is evident from <HI>Acts</HI> 4.12. Neither is there Salvation in any other; and he hath given us Eternal Life, &amp; this Life is in his Son. If Life could have been had any where el&s;e it &s;hould have been in the Law, no man living &s;hall be ju&s;tified; and i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> not ju&s;tified, then no Life.</P>

<P><HI>Qu.</HI> But why would God &s;o order it, that Life &s;hould be had no where el&s;e, but in <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> There is rea&s;on for it, and that with re&s;pect to God and us</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. <HI>With re&s;pect to God.</HI></P>

<P>Secondly, Life mu&s;t be by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that God might be adored and magnified, for finding <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ut the Way. This is the Lord's doings, that in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll things he might be glorified through Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord.</P>

<P>Fourthly, Life mu&s;t be in Chri&s;t to cut off Boa&s;|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing from the Lips of Men. This al&s;o is the Apo|&s;tle's Rea&s;on, <HI>Rom</HI> 3.20, 27.</P>
<P>Fifthly, Life mu&s;t be in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;pect to us.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, That we might have it upon the ea&s;ie&s;t Terms, to wit Freely; as a Gift, not as Wages: was it in Mo&s;es's hand, we &s;hould come hardly at it. Was it in the Pope's hand, we &s;hould pay &s;oundly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or it. But thanks be to God, it is in Chri&s;t laid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">p in him, and by him to be communicated to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ners upon ea&s;ie Terms, even &s;o receiving, ac|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">pting&punc; and embracing with Thanksgiving, as the Scripture plainly declare, <HI>Job.</HI> 1.11.</P>
<P>Secondly, Life is in Chri&s;t for us, that it might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">at be upon &s;o b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ttle a Foundation, as indeed it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ould, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> been any where el&s;e.

<P>Thirdly, Life is in Chri&s;t, that it might be &s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to be the Seed. Alas! the be&s;t of us&punc; was Life lef<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in our hands&punc; to be &s;ure we &s;hould forfeit it, over and over, and over. Or, was it in any other hand we &s;hould by our often Back&s;liding &s;o offend him&punc; that at la&s;t he would &s;hut up his Bowels in ever|la&s;ting Di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t us. But now it is in Chri&s;t it is with one that can pity, pray for Pardon yea&punc; multiply Pardons. It is with one that can have Compa&s;&s;ion upon us, when we are out of the wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; with one that hath an heart to fetch us again when we are gone a&s;tray: with one that can Par|don without upbraiding. Ble&s;&s;ed be God that Life is in Chri&s;t! For now 'tis &s;ure to all the Seed.</P>
<P>But Fourthly. This Doctrine of coming to Je&s;us Chri&s;t for Life, informs us of the Evil of Unbelief, that wicked thing that is the only, or chief hin|drance to the coming Sinner&punc; Doth the Text &s;ay, Come? Doth it &s;ay, And him that cometh to me, I will in no wi&s;e ca&s;t out? Then what an Evil is that keepeth Sinners from coming to Je&s;us Chri&s;t? And that Evil is Unbelief. For by Faith we come. By Unbelief we keep away. Therefore it is &s;aid to be that, by which a Soul is &s;aid to depart from God, becau&s;e it was that which at fir&s;t cau&s;ed the World to go off from him&punc; and that al&s;o that keeps them from him to this day, And it doth it the more ea&s;tly, becau&s;e it doth it with a Wile.</P>
<P>This Sin may be called, The White Devil, for it oftentimes in its mi&s;chievous doing in the Soul &s;hews as it was an Angel of Light, yet it acteth like a Coun&s;ellor of Heaven. Therefore, a little to D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|cour&s;e of this Di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is that Sin, above all others that hath &s;ome &s;hew of Rea&s;ons in its Attempts. For it keeps the Soul from Chri&s;t, by pretending its pre&s;ent un|fitne&s;s and unpreparedne&s;s, as want of more &s;en&s;e of Sin, want of more Repentance, want of more Hu|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ility,
<PB N="173" REF="003002_0088_0FEF95F3E47ECDD0">
want of a more broken Heart.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is the Sin that mo&s;t &s;uiteth with the Con|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ence. The Con&s;cience of the coming &s;inner tells <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">m, that he hath nothing Good; that he &s;tands <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">dictable for Ten thou&s;and Talents; that he is a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y ignorant, blind, and hard hearted Sinner, un|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">orthy to be once taken notice of by Je&s;us Chri&s;t. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd will you (&s;ays Unbelief) in &s;uch a ca&s;e as now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ou are, pre&s;ume to come to Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="3">3. It it the Sin that mo&s;t &s;uits with our Sen&s;e of feeling. The coming Sinner feels the Working of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n&punc; of all manner of Sin and Wretchedne&s;s in his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le&s;h; he al&s;o feels the Wrath and Judgment of God due to &s;in&punc; and oftimes &s;taggers under it. Now, &s;ays Unbelief&punc; you may &s;ee you have no Grace for that which works in you is Corruption. You may al&s;o perceive that God doth not love you, becau&s;e the &s;en&s;e of his wrath abides upon you. Therefore how can you bear the Face to come to Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="4">4. It is &s;in above all others, that mo&s;t &s;uiteth the Wi&s;dom of our Fle&s;h. The Wi&s;dom of our Fle&s;h thinks it Prudence to que&s;tion a while, to hearken to both &s;ides a while, and not to be ra&s;h &s;udden, or unadvi&s;ed, in too bold a pre&s;uming up|on Je&s;us Chri&s;t. And this Wi&s;dom Unbelief falls in with.</P>
<P N="5">5. It is the &s;in, above all others, that continually is whi&s;pering the Soul in the Ear with Mi&s;tru&s;ts of the Faithfulne&s;s of God in keeping Promi&s;e to 'em that come to Je&s;us Chri&s;t for Life. It al&s;o &s;ugge&s;ts Mi&s;tru&s;t about Chri&s;t's willingne&s;s to receive it. And no &s;in can do this &s;o artificially as Unbelief.</P>

He can life thee out of all Difficulties, wherewith thou may'&s;t be &s;urrounded. He is Wi&s;e in Heart, and Mighty in Power. Every Life under Heaven is in his hand, yea the fallen An+gels trembled before him: And he will &s;ave thy Life, coming Sinner, Cor. 1.24.</P>
<P N="7">7. Coming Sinner, the Je&s;us to whom thou art coming, is lowly in Heart, he de&s;pi&s;eth not any.

<P>Sixthly, Coming Sinner, I will add another En|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ouragement for thy help.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, God hath prepared a Mercy Seat, a Throne <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f Grace to fit on&punc; that thou may'&s;t come thither <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o him, and that he may from thence hear thee, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd receive thee.

<P>Thirdly, Art thou coming?

<P>Sixthly, Coming Sinner, ha&s;t thou now and then had a Ki&s;s of the &s;weet Lips of Je&s;us Chri&s;t? I mean, &s;ome ble&s;&s;ed words dropping like a Honey-comb upon thy Soul to revive thee when thou art in the mid&s;t of thy Dumps.</P>
<P>Seventhly, Does not Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;ometimes give thee a glimp&s;e of him&s;elf, though perhaps thou &s;ee&s;t him not &s;o long a time, as while you may tell Twenty.</P>
<P>Eighthly, Ha&s;t thou not &s;ometimes, as it were the warmth of his Wings over &s;hadowing the Face of thy Soul, that gives thee as it were, a load upon thy &s;pirit as the bright Beams of the Sun do upon thy Body, when it &s;uddenly breaks out of a Cloud, though pre&s;ently all is gone away.</P>
<P>Well, all the&s;e things are the good Hand of thy God upon thee, &amp; they are upon thee to con&s;train to provoke, and to make the will|ing and able to come (coming Sinner,) that thou mighte&s;t in the End be &s;aved.</P>
