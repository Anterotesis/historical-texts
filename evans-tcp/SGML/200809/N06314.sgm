<HEAD>AN EPISTLE TO THE NATIONAL MEETING, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dearly beloved Friends, and Brethren,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAving been for &s;ome Time under a <HI>deep</HI> and <HI>mournful</HI> Sen&s;e of the States of many of the Churches of Chri&s;t, a <HI>weighty</HI> Concern came upon my Spirit, to communicate &s;ome of tho&s;e Things to you which came under my Con&s;ideration, and I could not be ea&s;y until I had given up to do it; and as I fore&s;ee what I &s;hall write will be <HI>long,</HI> and the <HI>longer</HI> by <HI>commemorating</HI> the Dealings of the LORD with us in <HI>this</HI> Nation, as well as by writing &s;ome Things <HI>new</HI> and <HI>old:</HI> So therefore, I de&s;ire you will bear its Length, it being, in Proba|bility, the la&s;t Time that ever I &s;hall write to you, for I am but <HI>weak</HI> in Body, and <HI>ill</HI> able to write at this Time; and, in all <HI>human Pro&s;pect,</HI> not likely to continue long in this World. But however that
<PB N="4" REF="008008_0003_102DCB3D641F92E8">
may be, Oh! &s;aith my Soul, that the Lord will be plea&s;ed to keep and pre&s;erve me <HI>near</HI> to him&s;elf to the End, that &s;o in the End of my Time, I may at|tain to that <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> Re&s;t, that the ELDERS, who have gone before me, are already entred into.</P>
<P>And now, my <HI>dear Friends,</HI> I herewith &s;end you the Salutation of my <HI>endeared</HI> Love in our LORD and SAVIOUR JESUS CHRIST, which re|mains as <HI>fre&s;h</HI> and <HI>fervent</HI> with me now in <HI>old</HI> Age, as in my <HI>Youth,</HI> more e&s;pecially to you that tra|vel in <HI>Spirit,</HI> and are zealou&s;ly concerned for the Welfare and Pro&s;perity of SION, you are as <HI>near</HI> and <HI>dear</HI> to me as ever, and I have Unity with you, in the <HI>Covenant</HI> of Love and Life, whether you are <HI>old</HI> or <HI>young, rich</HI> or <HI>poor,</HI> for in this Love it is that we are bound up together in the Bundle of Life, being <HI>baptized by one Spirit into one Body,</HI> and in this Love which proceeds from the Spirit, the true Unity of the Church is kept up and main|tained in the <HI>Bond of Peace,</HI> whereby the <HI>whole Body is edified</HI> together in love, which you know is a <HI>&s;tronger</HI> Bond and Tye than all <HI>outward</HI> Laws, Creeds, or Confe&s;&s;ions of Faith <HI>without it.</HI></P>
<P>And be&s;ides this Gift of the HOLY SPIRIT, which CHRIST has given us for our Salvation, he has given <HI>additional</HI> Means and A&s;&s;i&s;tances <HI>con|ducive</HI> to that great End; thus he has afforded us the HOLY SCRIPTURES for our <HI>Information, Edification</HI> and <HI>Comfort,</HI> thro' the Spirit. He has &s;ent us his <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> and <HI>Me&s;&s;engers,</HI> whom he has furni&s;hed with the <HI>immediate</HI> Power of his Word: He has gifted ELDERS to <HI>over&s;ee, advi&s;e</HI> and <HI>admoni&s;h</HI> us, and, by his holy Spirit, he has moved upon both Mini&s;ters and Elders, to give forth and leave us <HI>holy In&s;tructions,</HI> for keeping <HI>godly</HI> Order

and Di&s;cipline in the <HI>Churches</HI> of CHRIST, to be as an <HI>Hedge</HI> and <HI>Fence</HI> about us for our Pre&s;erva|tion (&s;o far as Means can do) in this Unity of the Spirit, as well as to keep us from the <HI>In|roads</HI> of the Enemy, <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 5. 8.</NOTE> <HI>who goes about con|tinually &s;eeking whom he may devour.</HI></P>
<P>Our <HI>gracious</HI> LORD has done all this for us in our Day and Time, as he did formerly, &s;o that we may truly &s;ay with that holy Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah,</HI> who &s;poke from the Mouth of the Lord, &s;ay|ing, <HI>What could have been done more to my Vineyard that I have not done in it.</HI> And I pray God it may not be &s;aid of many of us now as he &s;aid to <HI>I&s;rael</HI> then, <HI>viz. Wherefore, when I looked that it &s;hould bring forth Grapes, it brought forth wild Grapes.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>I&s;a.</HI> 5. 4.</NOTE></P>
<P>Now, my <HI>dear Friends,</HI> that which bears the greate&s;t Weight upon my Spirt at this Time, is, re|lating to <HI>godly</HI> Order and Di&s;cipline in the Churches of Chri&s;t: And tho' I well know that you, who have retained your <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Love to God, and have kept your Habitations in his <HI>holy Truth,</HI> do not want any Information of mine to convince you of the <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> and <HI>Service</HI> thereof; yet, as <HI>out of the Abundance of the Heart: the Mouth &s;peaketh,</HI> &s;o out of the abundant Concern I feel upon my Spirit for the Pro&s;perity of Truth, I be&s;eech you bear with me while I ea&s;e my Mind, if it but prove of the lea&s;t Benefit to the Younger in your Meet|ing, by &s;tirring up the <HI>pure Mind by Way of Remem|brance;</HI> for notwith&s;tanding I am very &s;en&s;ible that &s;ome of you do want but little &s;tirring up to your Duty, re&s;pecting Di&s;cipline, yet I believe many others do. Neither do you want to be convinced that our <HI>Womens,</HI> as well as <HI>Mens,</HI> Meeting for

Di&s;cipline, were <HI>fir&s;t</HI> &s;et up by the <HI>Movings</HI> of the LORD's Power, through that <HI>worthy</HI> and <HI>faithful</HI> Elder GEORGE FOX; and al&s;o, that the Authority of the&s;e Meetings is to be kept up and maintained therein, you are <HI>living</HI> Witne&s;&s;es there|of, becau&s;e the LORD has often owned your Services in them by the <HI>Over&s;hawdowings</HI> of his <HI>glorious</HI> Power.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Exod.</HI> 18. 4.</NOTE> You know al&s;o, that in the <HI>fir&s;t In&s;titution</HI> of the&s;e our Mens Meetings, the Members of them were to be <HI>faithful</HI> Men, who were to rule and govern for the LORD, <HI>Men fearing</HI> GOD, <HI>and hating Covetou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> agreeable to tho&s;e in the Apo&s;tles Times, whom the HOLY GHOST had made <HI>Over&s;eers</HI> in the Church of CHRIST; yet this does not exclude <HI>ho|ne&s;t minded</HI> young Men from being admitted to &s;it in tho&s;e Meetings <HI>as Learners,</HI> who, growing in Truth, may at length come to have their <HI>&s;piritual</HI> Sen&s;es exerci&s;ed, &s;o as <HI>rightly</HI> to di&s;cern between <HI>Good</HI> and <HI>Evil,</HI> and <HI>Things that differ,</HI> tho' at fir&s;t they may not &s;ee into Things <HI>&s;o clearly</HI> as the <HI>faithful</HI> Elders did, yet as they grow in Truth, and <HI>follow them,</HI> as the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> advi&s;es, <HI>the Lord in due Time will reveal &s;uch Things unto them.</HI> I can &s;peak this from my own Experience; likewi&s;e, in a more general Way, as there are, and always will be, <HI>different</HI> Degrees of Growth in the Members of the Church of CHRIST, yet as all are <HI>growing</HI> in Truth, and drawing <HI>one Way,</HI> and aiming at the <HI>&s;ame</HI> Thing, namely the <HI>Honour of the</HI> LORD, and Pro&s;perity of his <HI>holy</HI> Truth, there will be a <HI>general</HI> Conde&s;cen|&s;ion and Submi&s;&s;ion to one another, but more e&s;pe|cially to <HI>godly</HI> Elders and Over&s;eers; here the<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Phil.</HI> 3. 15.</NOTE>

<HI>&s;trong</HI> and <HI>Self-will</HI> of Man is kept out, and the Unity of the Spirit, in an <HI>heavenly</HI> Harmony, maintained in tho&s;e Meetings, as well as among the whole Body, or Church of CHRIST.</P>
<P>And while Things remained in this Order, the true <HI>Watchmen</HI> for CHRIST, tho&s;e Elders, <HI>were good</HI> Examples to the Flock them&s;elves; they diligently watched them, le&s;t the Enemy &s;hould &s;teal in upon them; and when at any Time he made an Appearance, they gave the Alarm to the Flock to beware of the Devourer: Thus, if any Thing did appear <HI>contrary</HI> to Truth, of what Kind &s;oever, then pre&s;ently (without De|lay) tho&s;e <HI>true Watchmen</HI> did endeavour to put a Stop thereto; then it was that Things went well in general in the Churches of CHRIST. I could enlarge abundantly upon the good Effects of it, but &s;top my&s;elf, and in a few Words &s;ay, <HI>That then the Di&s;orderly were dealt with in due Time, ac|cording to the Nature of their Offences, and for their Good: And if they could not be reclaimed, they were &s;et in their Places, Truth cleared, and they made as Examples to others, and then tho&s;e Examples in &s;ome Mea&s;ure became a Terror to &s;uch who were inclined and ready to follow their di&s;orderly Steps, by which Means many, I believe, were deterred there from: And thus holy Di&s;cipline was kept in its right Chan|nel, and, above all, the LORD was plea&s;ed to own tho&s;e Services with his heavenly Power.</HI></P>
<P>But alas! alas! The State of Things continued in this Condition but a few Years before the Enemy of all Righteou&s;ne&s;s made Attempts to break down the <HI>Fence</HI> of Di&s;cipline, which had been &s;et up by the <HI>Power</HI> of GOD, and even prevailed on &s;ome, who had been as <HI>leading</HI> Elders and Mini|&s;ters,

to be concerned therein (&s;uch who once knew better Things) but had departed from their <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Love to Truth, and Zeal for it; the&s;e Men, with their <HI>libertine</HI> Company in our bordering Na|tion, did ri&s;e up again&s;t that <HI>Man</HI> of GOD, <HI>G. Fox,</HI> who had been made the In&s;trument, in the Hand of the LORD, to &s;et up good Order and Di&s;cipline; they levelled their Rage and Malice again&s;t him in particular, with tho&s;e who had kept their <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Love in general: But their <HI>chief</HI> End was to lay wa&s;te, and de&s;troy this <HI>good</HI> Order and Di&s;cipline, and <HI>leave every one to do as they plea&s;ed,</HI> and would have no Bounds &s;et, with this <HI>plau&s;ible</HI> Pretence, that all mu&s;t be left to the Light in their Con&s;ciences, and Friends mu&s;t wait until they are convinced, that &s;uch and &s;uch Things were <HI>contrary</HI> to Truth, tho' even many of the Things they went into, the <HI>Light</HI> of CHRIST led the <HI>true</HI> Followers of it out of, and to te&s;tify again&s;t, <HI>in the Beginning.</HI> This was <HI>plea&s;ing</HI> Doctrine to <HI>Libertines;</HI> it took with them, and they made u&s;e of it, and thereupon went into <HI>wrong</HI> Liberty, as <HI>Height, Pride, Fa&s;hions</HI> of the <HI>World, Stiff-neckedne&s;s, Strife, Centention,</HI> and <HI>&s;o unruly,</HI> that they would not &s;ubmit their Diffe|rences to Friends, with many other Things <HI>con|trary</HI> to Truth, too long to enumerate; and yet all this under a Pretence of <HI>Chri&s;tian Liberty,</HI> and that they were not convinced by the <HI>Light</HI> in their Con|&s;ciences to the contrary. In &s;hort, the Rebellion and Confederacy (again&s;t good Order in the Church) was very great and &s;trong, and in &s;ome Places they &s;et up <HI>&s;eparate</HI> Meetings; but the LORD brought a <HI>Bla&s;t</HI> upon that Spirit, and they came to nothing, as a Body of People; yet notwith&s;tanding this, the Seeds, which they had &s;own in this Time of <HI>undue</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="008008_0008_102DCB961B2CB9E0">
Liberty remained, and &s;till remain among&s;t many, in &s;ome Places, and in this Time it was that &s;ome of tho&s;e Seeds were brought into this Nation, by Examples from them, and in particular <HI>Height</HI> and <HI>Finery</HI> in <HI>Apparel</HI> and <HI>Hou&s;hold Stuff,</HI> with &s;ome o|ther Things, of which I am pre&s;ently to &s;peak.</P>
<P>Tho' I was but a <HI>young Man</HI> then, yet an <HI>Eye</HI> and <HI>Ear</HI> Witne&s;s of many of tho&s;e Things, having been at &s;everal of the Meetings in <HI>England,</HI> wherein this <HI>libertine</HI> Spirit rai&s;ed Contention, and then I clearly &s;aw the Tendency thereof, that it would, if po&s;&s;ible, lay wa&s;te the whole <HI>Heritage</HI> of GOD, and I bore my Te&s;timony again&s;t it, as <HI>convenient</HI> Sea&s;ons and Opportunities offered.</P>
<P>I have written after this Manner to &s;hew how <HI>good</HI> Order and Di&s;cipline was &s;et up and e&s;tabli&s;h|ed in a general Way, and what Spirit it was that oppo&s;ed it then, and I greatly fear the &s;ame Spi|rit is at work now, in this Nation, tho' in a differ|ent Appearance, not by their oppo&s;ing all Di&s;cipline in a general Manner as they did, but by breaking of Minutes, and weakening the Hands of the <HI>Faith|ful,</HI> who are <HI>zealou&s;ly</HI> concerned in Spirit for the Promotion of Truth, and keeping up the Di&s;cipline thereof, in its <HI>right</HI> Line.</P>
<P>Now, in opening the&s;e Things, I find I &s;hall be &s;till led on in an <HI>hi&s;torical</HI> Manner, and therefore de&s;ire your Patience, and tho' it tend not to the Information of you <HI>faithful</HI> Elders in <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> who know them already, yet it may be to the Younger, by <HI>commemorating</HI> the kind Dealings of the LORD towards us, and &s;tirring up the <HI>pure</HI> Mind in them, and that none of us may be ungrateful to him, for all the Benefits and Labour that he has be&s;tow|ed upon us.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="008008_0009_102DCB985D4B7F18">
I have already &s;aid, that &s;ome of the Seeds, which that libertine Spirit had &s;own, were brought over into this Nation, and particularly that of <HI>Height and Finery in Apparel and Hou&s;ehold Furni|ture,</HI> &amp;c. And by exampling one another, they came to a great Height at la&s;t, tho' not to that Degree, as in the other Nation, but we are going fa&s;t into them.</P>
<P>Now, upon this Occa&s;ion, I mu&s;t revive the Me|mory of that <HI>Worthy</HI> Elder <HI>William Edmund&s;on,</HI> of this Nation, who&s;e Memory and Labours live, and are &s;weet to the <HI>upright</HI> in Heart, and who (as mo&s;t of you well know) was <HI>eminently</HI> in&s;tru|mental in the Hand of the LORD, not only in a <HI>powerful</HI> Mini&s;try by Word and Doctrine, but al&s;o for e&s;tabli&s;hing and maintaining <HI>good</HI> Order and Di&s;cipline in the Churches of CHRIST. He <HI>zealou&s;ly</HI> and with <HI>undaunted</HI> Courage &s;tood up <HI>faith|fully</HI> for the LORD and his Cau&s;e, and oppo&s;ed all <HI>fal&s;e</HI> Liberty, in its <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Appearance, and was, to my <HI>certain</HI> Knowledge, much grieved, when he &s;aw it growing in this Nation, and faithfully bore his Te&s;timony again&s;t it, <HI>without Favour or Affec|tion,</HI> and tho' he did &s;o, and that many Epi&s;tles and Minutes went forth from our Half-year Meet|ing, again&s;t that <HI>libertine</HI> Spirit of <HI>Height, Pride, and other Things,</HI> that had grown upon us, yet all did not prove fully effectual, until at la&s;t the LORD ble&s;t his <HI>unwearied</HI> Endeavours, with Succe&s;s, as a <HI>chief</HI> In&s;trument in the Hand of GOD, for putting <HI>godly</HI> Di&s;cipline in <HI>due</HI> and <HI>clo&s;e</HI> Execution, and by which Means a Stop was put to that Spirit, in <HI>great</HI> Mea&s;ure, until he was taken from us, and it is now about out Thirty Years &s;ince the LORD rai&s;ed up and &s;pirited many <HI>godly</HI> Elders to join with
<PB N="11" REF="008008_0010_102DCB9A199F0560">
him, as one Man, in this Work of <HI>Reformation,</HI> and thereupon Epi&s;tles were given forth from Half-years Meetings, which named Abundance of Su|perfluities, in <HI>Apparel, Hou&s;e Furniture, garni&s;hing of Hou&s;es,</HI> &amp;c. with <HI>numerous</HI> other Things relat|ing to <HI>Conver&s;ation</HI> and <HI>Behaviour,</HI> and running <HI>greedily</HI> after the Things of this World, too long to enumerate, and which may be &s;een in tho&s;e Minutes, and for the more effectual performing this Work, they directed us to chu&s;e out <HI>right &s;pirited</HI> Friends, who had a Concern upon them for the Pro&s;perity of Truth, and putting away all tho&s;e Things that were as <HI>Nui&s;ances</HI> in the Church, to vi&s;it every <HI>particular</HI> Family, to <HI>&s;ee, in&s;pect</HI> and <HI>advi&s;e</HI> ac|cordingly, as they &s;aw Occa&s;ion for it.</P>
<P>Now, about this Time, the LORD had al&s;o rai&s;|ed a Concern in the Minds of the <HI>faithful</HI> Elders, in mo&s;t Parts of this Nation, and, with them, had likewi&s;e been preparing the Hearts of a <HI>younger</HI> and <HI>middle aged</HI> Generation, to join in this Work, and when tho&s;e Epi&s;tles and Minutes came down to this Province, there was a <HI>general</HI> A&s;&s;ent in the Minds of Friends to comply with the Advices they gave us, as &s;eeing the Nece&s;&s;ity of it; and indeed I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I believe that we, in this City of <HI>Cork,</HI> were at that time as much concern|ed to take the Advice as any in the Nation; for tho' our Wives and Children dre&s;&s;ed pretty plain, yet many of them wore <HI>rich co&s;tly</HI> Apparel, tho' of grave Colours, and many of our Hou&s;es were furni&s;hed with <HI>divers</HI> Superfluities, that were not <HI>agreeable</HI> to the Plainne&s;s of Truth, and as Truth (I am &s;atisfied) led into, in the Beginning.</P>
<P>However, &s;o it was that the LORD touched the Hearts of tho&s;e al&s;o, and they joined <HI>Heart and</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="008008_0011_102DCB9E09751CB0">
<HI>Hand</HI> to the Work, in fir&s;t clean&s;ing their own Hou&s;es and Families from the&s;e Things, and after that, as Elders were appointed according to the Advice of the Half-year's Meeting to vi&s;it Families, &s;o &s;ome of tho&s;e, the <HI>Younger,</HI> were appointed a|mong&s;t the re&s;t; but I well know it was very hard for &s;ome them to give up to it, as thinking the Service too <HI>weighty</HI> for them, but having a Con|cern upon their Spirits, that the Work &s;hould go on, they at la&s;t complied, tho' in a Cro&s;s to their own Wills, they went in much <HI>Weakne&s;s, Fear and Trembling,</HI> but the LORD (I te&s;tify) was with and &s;trengthened them in the Service. I write this for the Encouragement of all <HI>hone&s;t hearted young Per&s;ons,</HI> &s;uch who are concerned in Spirit for the Pro&s;perity of Truth, and that think them&s;elves very weak, and thereby are <HI>too backward</HI> in &s;uch Services, which the <HI>faithful</HI> Elders in the Church of GOD &s;hall think them mea&s;urably capable of.</P>
<P>It is with me to let the <HI>Younger</HI> know how Friends proceeded in their Vi&s;its; and this I do, in order to &s;tir up their Minds by Way of Informa|tion and Encouragement. The Vi&s;iters cho&s;en <HI>fir&s;t</HI> met together, and, in the Love of GOD, without <HI>Partiality,</HI> examined one another, how far they &s;tood <HI>clear</HI> them&s;elves, relating to the Things about which they were going to advi&s;e others; and, after due Examination, proceeded thus: When we came to a Family, we &s;at down with them, and fir&s;t wait|ed a while upon the LORD, and then, as it aro&s;e in the Minds of any, we principally in the fir&s;t Place directed them to the Gift of the LORD's Spirit in them&s;elves, as that by which <HI>alone</HI> they could grow in the Truth, and which would lead them in outward Things, agreeable thereto, as to <HI>Con|ver&s;ation,</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="008008_0012_102DCB9F9A0A2340">
<HI>Behaviour and Plainne&s;s of Apparel and Speech,</HI> &amp;c. as it led our Elders in the Begin|ning; and that altho' the&s;e Things were very <HI>com|mendable</HI> in their Places, yet told them, they would not do <HI>of them&s;elves,</HI> except the Heart was al&s;o right in the Sight of the LORD: And having &s;poken what was in our Minds, according to the State of the Family we vi&s;ited (&s;ometimes all to|gether, and &s;ometimes particularly apart, as we &s;aw Occa&s;ion for it) we then came to the Minutes from our Half-year's Meeting, and &s;poke parti|cularly to them.</P>
<P>And this I may tell you of a Truth, that in all tho&s;e Vi&s;its we made in this City at that time we met with no <HI>Oppo&s;ition</HI> or <HI>Contradiction</HI> in any one Family or particular Per&s;on, that I remem|ber, but a <HI>general</HI> Conde&s;cen&s;ion in all, and &s;ome|times a <HI>free</HI> and <HI>open</HI> Confe&s;&s;ion of Things that had been ami&s;s, and that in <HI>great</HI> Tenderne&s;s, with Hopes of Amendment for the future; &s;o that the Vi&s;iters and Vi&s;ited had <HI>great</HI> Satisfaction in that Service; and this I may further tell you, above all, the LORD owned our Service, by favouring us with his holy Power therein, &s;o that in &s;ome Families, where Things were well, the LORD over&s;hadowed us by his <HI>living</HI> Pre&s;ence, and melted us down together, as into one Lump; <HI>May my Soul never forget tho&s;e Times, while I have a Day to live in this World!</HI></P>
<P>Now, after tho&s;e Vi&s;its were over in this City, in convenient Time mo&s;t of tho&s;e Vi&s;iters here did accompany &s;ome other <HI>faithful</HI> Elders in the Pro|vince, and they went through it, vi&s;iting the Fa|milies of Friends, like as they had done in this Ci|ty, which had much the <HI>&s;ame</HI> Effects as here, there

being <HI>a general</HI> Conde&s;cen&s;ion to comply with the De&s;ire of the Half-year's Meeting; and ac|cordingly, in Time, there was (I think I may &s;ay) a pretty full and <HI>effectual</HI> Reformation in this Pro|vince in outward Things that had been ami&s;s, and which that Meeting de&s;ired might be put away) and I under&s;tood the like Succe&s;s attended that Service in other Parts of this Nation; and thus Things &s;tood for &s;everal Years, and there was <HI>great</HI> Unity among Friends of this Province in particu|lar, as well as in general throughout the re&s;t of the Kingdom, and the LORD was plea&s;ed there|with, which he manife&s;ted oftentimes by the <HI>Overflowings</HI> of his <HI>divine Power</HI> in the Meetings of Friends.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, my dear Friends, my writing after this Manner looks rather like an <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> or <HI>Nar|rative</HI> than an Epi&s;tle, but I de&s;ire you will bear with me, it being to magnify the <HI>loving Kindne&s;s</HI> of the LORD in (rehear&s;ing) his Dealings with us, and for the Information and Encouragement of the <HI>Younger,</HI> that they may follow the Steps of the <HI>worthy Antients,</HI> who have followed Chri&s;t, and &s;hun and avoid that <HI>libertine</HI> Spirit, which I fear is now getting in, and has got in again, en|deavouring to throw down and lay wa&s;te what our <HI>godly</HI> Elders had reared up by the <HI>Power</HI> of the LORD, and from this Fear, I am led to query after this Manner.</P>
<P>Is there not (&s;ome) in Being, who not only &s;aw tho&s;e Times of <HI>outward</HI> Reformation, but al&s;o heartily joined therein, by putting away out of their Hou&s;es and Families tho&s;e Superfluities in <HI>Finene&s;s of Apparel</HI> and <HI>Hou&s;hold Furniture,</HI> &amp;c. I am &s;atisfied there are. Or is there any who, &s;ince

that Time, have owned that Concern, and for a Time &s;tood zealous for the Plainne&s;s of Truth? I am per&s;uaded there are. And now I query, is there any of late Times, of both Sorts, who have lo&s;t that former Zeal, and &s;uffered or permitted &s;ome of the <HI>&s;ame</HI> or <HI>greater Superfluities in Apparel and Dre&s;s to be worn by their Children, and in their Families; and likewi&s;e have &s;uffered or permitted as fine or finer Hou&s;e Furniture and Garni&s;hing to come into their own Hou&s;es, or their Childrens,</HI> which I am &s;atisfied they might have prevented, by zealou&s;ly &s;tanding again&s;t it; and moreover, have they not connived at others that have gone into &s;uch Things? I fear there are &s;uch.</P>
<P>Now, by the&s;e and the like Means, and by taking Examples from one another, the Seeds of <HI>Height, Pride</HI> and <HI>Vanity,</HI> have grown and &s;pread more (among us) than ever they were before that Time of <HI>Reformation,</HI> to the Wounding and Griev|ing of the Souls of the upright in Heart. Oh! Friends (<HI>Friends</HI>) I have this to &s;ay to you, from the Movings of the Spirit of the LORD in my Heart, how will you an&s;wer it in the Day of Ac|count? You, I &s;ay, that by your <HI>Ea&s;ine&s;s</HI> and <HI>Luke-warmne&s;s,</HI> have let in tho&s;e offen&s;ive Things upon us again; for as our ble&s;&s;ed Lord &s;aid, <HI>Who&s;o &s;hall offend one of the&s;e little Ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a Mil&s;tone were hanged about his Neck, and that he were drowned in the Depth of the Sea.</HI> What will be the Portion of &s;uch as the&s;e? Therefore let all who are concerned herein repent, and do their <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Works, before it be <HI>too late.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mat.</HI> 18. 6.</NOTE></P>
<P>Again, be&s;ides <HI>Height, Pride</HI> and <HI>Fa&s;hions,</HI> which have (I fear) appeared in too many with a <HI>daring</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="008008_0015_102DCBA7B9F92020">
Face, is there not &s;ome that have very much lo&s;t, or been a&s;hamed of, the <HI>plain</HI> Language, both in <HI>&s;peaking</HI> and <HI>writing.</HI></P>
<P>I further query, Are there not &s;ome, who have gone into <HI>undue</HI> Liberty of many Kinds, and o|thers that would be accounted <HI>&s;omething,</HI> who have gone into <HI>Contentions, Broils,</HI> and <HI>Differences,</HI> (through a <HI>covetous</HI> and <HI>&s;elfi&s;h</HI> Spirit) to the Trou|ble of the Church? I wi&s;h there may not. But I cannot well pa&s;s by that <HI>evil</HI> Spirit of Covetou&s;|ne&s;s without the following Remark. <Q>It is an abominable Evil in the Sight of the LORD, CHRIST him&s;elf &s;everely reprehended it, and cautioned to beware thereof; his <HI>holy</HI> A|po&s;tle called it <HI>Idolatry,</HI> and the <HI>former</HI> Pro|phets cried out again&s;t it; as did in like Manner that <HI>worthy</HI> Elder <HI>William Edmund&s;on</HI> (herein before mentioned) often warning us to beware thereof; where it takes <HI>deep</HI> Root in the Heart, it is a <HI>mercile&s;s devouring</HI> Spirit, not only endeavouring to <HI>devour</HI> others, but even de&s;troy that <HI>Man him&s;elf</HI> who gives Way thereto, and very little can &s;tand before it, therefore beware thereof wherever it appears.</Q></P>
<P>And la&s;tly, be&s;ides what I have queried above, I here query in a more general Manner, Are there not &s;ome who were once very zealous, and &s;tood again&s;t all tho&s;e Things I have mentioned, and if they had kept their Habitations in the LORD's <HI>holy</HI> Truth, might have been made &s;erviceable In&s;truments in his Hand; and as <HI>bright</HI> Stars in the <HI>Firmament</HI> of his Power, and have joined <HI>Hand in Hand,</HI> and put <HI>Shoulder to Shoulder,</HI> in helping the <HI>Faithful</HI> to keep out tho&s;e Things; and by which Means I am
<PB N="17" REF="008008_0016_102DCBDA5E7E6198">
per&s;uaded they would in great Mea&s;ure have been kept out. I &s;ay, Is there not &s;ome of tho&s;e (tho' I hope not many) that now of late Years have been <HI>faulty</HI> in &s;ome of tho&s;e Things them|&s;elves, and others who have &s;tood <HI>ea&s;y,</HI> and <HI>uncon|cerned</HI> in Mind, while they have &s;een and beheld &s;ome that were going into them, and in&s;tead of helping the zealous and upright in Heart, have rather <HI>clogged</HI> and <HI>weakened</HI> their Hands, by <HI>openly</HI> or <HI>&s;ecretly</HI> abetting the Cau&s;e of the wrong Spirit|ed and the Di&s;orderly, &s;o far as they were able, and thereby have &s;ometimes fended off the Stroke of Ju&s;tice and Judgment, in the Way of Di&s;|cipline (and hindered the Line thereof) from be|ing &s;tretched over &s;uch <HI>in due Time,</HI> according to the Nature of their Offences: <HI>For if right Times be not ob&s;erved, right Services may be lo&s;t.</HI> Where|as, if true Di&s;cipline had been duly and rightly executed, it might probably have tended to the <HI>Good of &s;uch Offenders them&s;elves;</HI> as well as the <HI>Dettering others</HI> from following their Steps; but, above all, it would have kept up, and e&s;tabli&s;hed good Order and Di&s;cipline in its right Line in the Church of CHRIST.</P>
<P>The Breaking or Ob&s;tructing this right Line of Di&s;cipline has (I fear) produced a <HI>partial</HI> conniving among&s;t &s;ome; for have not the <HI>Ea&s;y, Luke-warm,</HI> and <HI>Indifferent</HI> (who have lo&s;t their fir&s;t Love) daubed with <HI>untempered</HI> Mortar, while they have endeavoured to &s;kreen and defend the <HI>Covetous,</HI> and <HI>Troublers</HI> of the Church? And, on the other Hand, have not &s;uch joined with the <HI>luke-warm</HI> Daubers, when they have been ju&s;tly found Fault withal, and then

both Sorts have been ea&s;y with the <HI>High, Proud</HI> and <HI>Libertines,</HI> who al&s;o in <HI>their Turn</HI> (as they had Opportunity) defended the re&s;t; and thus they have &s;trengthened one another, contrary to that <HI>mo&s;t &s;olemn</HI> Charge which the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> gave to <HI>Timothy,</HI> in Relation to the Management of the Church Affairs, <HI>viz.

<P>But as for you, <HI>my dear Friends,</HI> who have re|tained your <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Love to GOD, and have &s;tood <HI>zealous</HI> for the LORD and his Truth, whether you are Mini&s;ters or Elders, <HI>young</HI> or <HI>old,</HI> what

I write touches you not; therefore I verily be|lieve you will not be offended at it, for you can di&s;cern from what Spirit I write: But notwith|&s;tanding I have enumerated &s;o many <HI>hurtful</HI> Things which have prevailed upon &s;ome that have been <HI>unwatchful,</HI> yet I hope none will mi|&s;take me &s;o far as that thereby I mean the Gene|rality of Friends, which I am far from doing; for I believe, and know, that the Lord has &s;till a <HI>faithful</HI> People in this Nation, which I hope he will pre&s;erve to the End.</P>
<P>Moreover, I have this in particular to &s;ay to you that go <HI>mourning</HI> under the Burden of tho&s;e Things I have mentioned, be not <HI>too</HI> much di&s;|couraged tho' &s;ome of your Brethren, that &s;hould have helped you, have left you, it was &s;o of old; remember that great Servant of the LORD, <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> how often he was brought into great Straits, by Oppo&s;itions he met with from <HI>re|bellious I&s;rael,</HI> yet the LORD &s;tood by him, and carried him through to the End.

&s;tand your Ground, and be zealous for the LORD and his Te&s;timony, and though <HI>you cannot do all you de&s;ire, yet do all you can for him,</HI> and the LORD will &s;tand by you, as he did by them formerly.</P>
<P><HI>Dear Friends,</HI> there is another Thing of great Con&s;equence that I have not yet mentioned, which has done abundance of Mi&s;chief in the Church, and that is the <HI>Fondne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Indulgence</HI> of many <HI>Parents</HI> to their <HI>Children,</HI> in giving them their own Way and Wills &s;o long, until the Root of Evil has grown and &s;pread it&s;elf forth into many <HI>evil</HI> Branches, and at length they have been &s;o alienated from Truth and Friends, that &s;ome of them have run quite out. I could en|large abundantly upon the <HI>evil</HI> Effects of this <HI>fond</HI> Indulgence, but that I have been &s;o large already on other Matters, and that we have &s;o many Minutes again&s;t it.</P>
<P>However I &s;ay, that tho' &s;ome godly Parents have di&s;charged their Duty to their Children, which has not had the de&s;ired Effect, yet they will be clear of their Blood; but I believe too ma|ny have not performed their Duty, by which Ne|glect their Children have taken wrong Liberty, and fallen into hurtful Things; &s;uch Parents mu&s;t be accountable for it in the Day of the LORD.</P>
<P>I have already &s;poken of admitting <HI>young</HI> Men into <HI>Mens</HI> Meetings, but have this to add (not as your Director) but as believing it is what Truth will lead all <HI>right &s;pirited</HI> Friends into in every Quarter, <HI>viz.</HI> To be very careful not to admit of any unle&s;s they come under the&s;e following Qualifications. Fir&s;t, They &s;hould be
<PB N="21" REF="008008_0020_102DCBE406B28DC8">
<HI>&s;ober</HI> and <HI>orderly</HI> in their Conver&s;ations. Second|ly, they &s;hould be <HI>plain,</HI> and <HI>exemplary</HI> in their Habit, Apparel and Dre&s;&s;ing, likewi&s;e <HI>no Tatlers.</HI> And thirdly, that &s;o far as Friends can have a Sen&s;e of their Spirits, that they will be <HI>conde&s;cend|ing to godly</HI> Elders, and not either in their Words or Spirits likely to oppo&s;e them, for I have ob|&s;erved in my Time, that &s;ome, who have been ad|mitted, without the&s;e Qualifications, have in Time proved <HI>great</HI> Troublers of the Church, e&s;pecially if they have had <HI>fluent</HI> Tongues, which I have beheld in &s;ome Places (in my former Tra|vels,) <HI>to the Grief of my Soul.</HI></P>
<P>Another Thing I may ob&s;erve to you, that we have <HI>a great</HI> many <HI>young</HI> and <HI>middle-aged</HI> Men among&s;t us, who are <HI>orderly,</HI> in their Conver&s;ations, and al&s;o wi&s;h well to the Pro&s;perity of Truth, and yet are (as I may term it) either <HI>indolent,</HI> or too much incumbred in the Things of this World, and thereby are backward in coming up into <HI>that Service</HI> for Truth, which otherwi&s;e they might be capable of, were their <HI>Spiritual</HI> Sen&s;es rightly exerci&s;ed, but by their being <HI>&s;o backward</HI> their Sen&s;es grow (as it were) <HI>dull,</HI> for want of U&s;e, and I believe it will become the Duty of <HI>godly</HI> Elders in all the Meetings where &s;uch are, to <HI>&s;tir</HI> them up to <HI>mind the Gift</HI> that is in them, or if Need be, even to <HI>rou&s;e</HI> them up to their Duties, as well for their <HI>own</HI> Good, as the <HI>Service</HI> they may have for the Truth.</P>
<P>And now, <HI>dear Friends,</HI> I am come near to as End of this very long Epi&s;tle, and tho' I have been <HI>thus large</HI> already, yet <HI>one</HI> Thing more, bears
<PB N="22" REF="008008_0021_102DCBE6796B3418">
Weight upon my Mind, and I could not be <HI>ea&s;y</HI> without touching upon it, which if it &s;hall only tend to <HI>a Caution</HI> of the Younger, my End will be an&s;wered; and that is relating to the <HI>clo&s;e Join|ing</HI> in Familiarity with any <HI>dark oppo&s;ite</HI> and <HI>un|ruly</HI> Spirits; you know we have Minutes again&s;t it; and the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> was of the <HI>&s;ame</HI> Mind, when he advi&s;ed to <HI>have no Company with any who obeyed not their Word, by that Epi&s;tle,</HI> 2 The&s;. iii. 14. 16. yet in that Ca&s;e advi&s;eth not <HI>to count &s;uch as an Enemy, but admoni&s;h him as a Brother,</HI> but po&s;itively commands, in the Name of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, to <HI>withdraw from every Brother that walked di&s;orderly and not after the Tradition received of the Apo&s;tle,</HI> &amp;c. 2 The&s;. iii. 6. and likewi&s;e to <HI>have no Fellow&s;hip with the un|fruitful Works of Darkne&s;s, but reprove them.</HI></P>
<P>Now, if any of tho&s;e who walk <HI>orderly,</HI> and are in Fellow&s;hip with Friends, do contract a very <HI>intimate and unnece&s;&s;ary Familiarity</HI> with Per&s;ons of <HI>dark</HI> or <HI>oppo&s;ite</HI> Spirits, I believe it will have the&s;e following <HI>bad</HI> Effects. Fir&s;t, It may rather &s;trengthen them in that Spirit, than help to re|claim them from their <HI>Oppo&s;ition.</HI> Secondly, It may harden them in <HI>Prejudice</HI> again&s;t tho&s;e that can|not do the &s;ame. Thirdly, It may be of <HI>ill Ex|ample,</HI> and tend to the further Hurt of others, who are inclined to follow the Steps of the <HI>Unfaithful.</HI> But beyond all this, in my Time I have ob&s;erved, that even the <HI>Orderly</HI> them&s;elves have been <HI>greatly</HI> hurt, at la&s;t &s;ome of them <HI>lo&s;t</HI> thereby, for having the&s;e Opportunities of <HI>frequent</HI> Conver&s;ation to|gether; and by the <HI>continual</HI> buzzing Things again&s;t the <HI>Faithful,</HI> the <HI>Orderly</HI> have in length of Time

lent an Ear to them, whereby <HI>Surmi&s;es</HI> and <HI>Jea|lou&s;ies</HI> have been begotten, then <HI>Hardne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Pre|judice</HI> have entered; and la&s;tly, a <HI>joining in Con|federacy with dark Spirits</HI> again&s;t tho&s;e who have nothing more in their View than the <HI>Honour</HI> of the LORD, and <HI>Good of Souls;</HI> and by this very Means (even to my own certain Knowledge) many who (at fir&s;t) were <HI>orderly</HI> and <HI>hone&s;t mind|ed,</HI> were caught in this Snare in the Time of the <HI>Separation,</HI> and &s;ome taken in the &s;ame in this Nation al&s;o: Therefore, I hope the <HI>Orderly</HI> will ob&s;erve our Minutes and the Advice and Com|mands of the Apo&s;tles, and if they have Occa|&s;ion (as they may often) to conver&s;e with any of the other Sort, to <HI>keep upon their Watch,</HI> and carry towards them, as to <HI>&s;uch who are under Ad|monition,</HI> for I am &s;ure Truth will lead thereto.</P>
