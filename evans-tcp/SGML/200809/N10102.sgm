<HEAD>A LETTER From an Eminent Mini&s;ter in the Church of Scotland: written to a Mini&s;ter of his Acquaintance at &s;ome di&s;tance in the &s;ame Kingdom.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Reverend and Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY de&s;ire and inten&s;ion in this Letter is to inform you what the Lord has lately done for my &s;oul: In order to this, it may be needful to give you a little previous information of my manner of life from my youth up, to the pre&s;ent time.</P>
<P>When I was about the age of fourteen, God was plea&s;ed to &s;hew me that I was a &s;inner, and that I mu&s;t be born again before I could enter into his kingdom. Accordingly, I betook my&s;elf to reading, praying and watching; and was enabled hereby to make &s;ome pro|gre&s;s in &s;anctification. In this manner I went on, tho' not always with the &s;ame diligence till about half a year ago. I thought my&s;elf in the right way to heaven, though as yet I was wholly out of the way; and ima|gined I was travelling towards Sion, though I had ne|ver yet &s;et my face thitherwards. Indeed God would have &s;hewn me that I was wrong, by not owning my mini&s;try, but I had no regard to this for a long time, imputing my want of &s;ucce&s;s to the haughty hearts of my hearers, and not to my naughty doctrine.</P>
<P>You may a&s;k, perhaps, What was my doctrine?
<PB N="2" REF="012832_0003_0F8B404C611A3A58">
Why, dear Sir, it was the doctrine that every man will naturally hold whil&s;t he continues in an unregenerate <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, viz. that we are to be ju&s;tified partly by our faith, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> by our works. This doctrine I preached for eight years, and though I took &s;ome extraordinary pains, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;anctification upon the people very <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> yet they continued as <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;anctified in their hearts, and unholy in their lives, as before. There was indeed a little more of the form of religion in the pa|ri&s;h but not a <HI>whit</HI> more of the <HI>power</HI> Ju&s;t after I had preached eight years in this manner, I began to be di&s;couraged; and now &s;ome &s;ecret mi&s;givings aro&s;e in my mind that I was not right my&s;elf. This happened about &s;ix months ago. Tho&s;e mi&s;givings grew &s;tron|ger, and at la&s;t, very painful. Being then under great doubts, I cried unto the Lord very earne&s;tly. The con&s;tant language of my heart was this&mdash;"Lord, if I am right, keep me &s;o; if I am not right make me &s;o Lead me to the knowledge of the truth as it is in Je&s;us."</P>
<P>After about ten days crying unto the Lord, he was plea&s;ed to return an an&s;wer to my prayer, and in the following wonderful manner. As I was &s;itting in my hou&s;e one morning, and mu&s;ing upon a text of &s;crip|ture, the following words were darted into my mind with great power, and &s;eemed, indeed, like a voice from heaven, (viz.) <HI>Cea&s;e from thy own works,</HI> before I heard the&s;e words, my mind was in a very unu&s;ual calm; but as &s;oon as I heard them, my &s;oul was in a tempe&s;t directly, and the tears flowed from my eyes like a torrent. The &s;cales fell from the eyes of my under&s;tanding immediately, and I now clearly &s;aw the rock I had been &s;plitting on for near thirty years.</P>
<P>Do you a&s;k what this rock was? Why, it was &s;ome
<PB N="3" REF="012832_0003_0F8B404C611A3A58">
&s;ecret reliance on my <HI>own works</HI> for &s;alvation. I had hoped to be &s;aved, partly in my <HI>own</HI> name, and partly in <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s name; though I am told there is &s;alvation in no other name except in the name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, Acts iv. 12. I had hoped to be &s;aved partly through my own works, and partly through Chri&s;t's mercies; though I am told we are &s;aved by grace through faith, and not of works, Eph. ii. 7, 8. I had hoped to make my&s;elf acceptable to God, partly <HI>through my own good works,</HI> though we are told that we are accepted thro' the beloved, Eph. i. 6. I had hoped to make my peace with God, partly through my own obedience to his laws, though I am told that <HI>peace</HI> is only to be had by faith, Rom. v.i. I had hoped to make my&s;elf a child of God by [legal] &s;anctification, though we are told, that we are made children of God by faith in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, Gal. iii. 26. I had thought that Regene|ration, the new Birth, or the new Creature con&s;i&s;ted in this legal &s;anctification, but now I know it con&s;i&s;ts in faith, 1 John v. 1.&mdash;Compare al&s;o the&s;e two pa&s;|&s;ages together, Gal. vi. 15.&mdash;and Gal. vi. 5.&mdash;where you will find that the new creature is <HI>faith working by love</HI>; the apo&s;tle adds the&s;e words, <HI>working by love</HI>; in order to di&s;tingui&s;h a <HI>living</HI> faith from a <HI>dead</HI> one. I had thought that &s;anctification was the way to ju&s;ti|fication, but now I am a&s;&s;ured that &s;anctification fol|lows after ju&s;tification; or in other words, that we mu&s;t fir&s;t be ju&s;tified by faith before we can have any true &s;anctification by the Spirit. When we are ju&s;ti|fied it is done <HI>freely,</HI> that is, graciou&s;ly without any the lea&s;t merits of ours, and &s;olely by the grace of God through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, Rom. iii. 24&mdash;28.</P>
<P>All that is previou&s;ly needful to ju&s;tification, is this, that we are convinced by the Spirit of God of our own
<PB N="4" REF="012832_0004_0F8B404D8D24D670">
utter &s;infulne&s;s, I&s;a. lxiv. 6.&mdash;Convinced that we are the children of wrath by nature, on account of our Birth-&s;in, Eph. ii. 3.&mdash;And that we are under the cur&s;e of God on account of actual &s;in, Gal. iii. 10.&mdash;And under the&s;e convictions come to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, renouncing all righteou&s;ne&s;s of our own, and relying &s;olely on him, who is appointed to be "the Lord our righteou&s;ne&s;s," Jer. xxiii. 6. Again, Chri&s;t &s;ays, "Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, (with the burden of &s;in) and I will give you re&s;t," i. e. I will take the burden away, I will relea&s;e you from the guilt of &s;in. Where you may ob&s;erve, that the only thing required of us when we come to Chri&s;t, is to come burdened and &s;en&s;ible that none can remove this burden but Chri&s;t. Again, Chri&s;t did not come to call the righteous, but &s;inners to repentance. See al&s;o Luke iv. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">. Hear how he cries out in I&s;a. lv. 1. "Ho e|very one that thir&s;teth, come ye to the waters and drink, come buy wine and milk (i. e.) the ble&s;&s;ings of the Go&s;pel) without money and without price." Where we are ordered to bring no money, i. e. no merits of our own, we mu&s;t not think to make a purcha&s;e of the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings by any de&s;erts of ours. They are offered freely, i. e. graciou&s;ly, and mu&s;t be received freely. Nothing more is required of us than to thir&s;t after them. Why was the Phari&s;ee rejected? [Luke xviii. 10.] Becau&s;e he came pleading his own works before God He was devout, ju&s;t, cha&s;te and ab&s;temious; and thanked God for enabling him to be &s;o. Very well; &s;o far all was right. But then he had &s;ome re|liance on the&s;e works, and therefore pleads the merits of them before God; which &s;hewed that he did not know what a &s;inner he was, and that he could only be &s;aved by grace through faith. He opens his mouth be|fore
<PB N="5" REF="012832_0004_0F8B404D8D24D670">
God, and pleads his own cau&s;e; though God de|clares that every mouth &s;hall be &s;topped before him, and the whole world brought in guilty before God, Rom. iii. 19. And why was the Publican ju&s;tified? Not on account of his own good works, but becau&s;e he was &s;en&s;ible of his evil ones; and accordingly came &s;elf-accu&s;ed, &s;elf-condemned, and crying out for mercy.</P>
<P>And now dear Sir, hear what is the ri&s;e and pro|gre&s;s of true religion in the &s;oul of man. When the Spirit of God has convinced any per&s;on that he is a child of wrath, and under the cur&s;e of God, [in which &s;tate every one continues to be, till he has received Je|&s;us Chri&s;t into his heart by faith,] then the heart of &s;uch a one becomes broken for &s;in; then, too, he feels what he never knew before, that he has no faith: and accordingly laments his evil heart of unbelief. In this &s;tate men continue &s;ome a longer, &s;ome a le&s;s time, till God is plea&s;ed to work faith in them. Then they are ju&s;tified, and are at peace with God, Rom. v. 1. i. e. have their &s;ins forgiven them, for that is the meaning of the word, <HI>peace.</HI> See Luke vii. 48,&mdash;50. &mdash;When we have received faith from God, [for it is his gift, Eph. ii. 8.] to ju&s;tify our per&s;ons, then we afterwards receive the Spirit to &s;anctify our natures, Eph i 13.&mdash;Gal. iii. 14. And now the work of [go&s;pel] &s;anctification goes forwards; now his fruit is more and more unto holine&s;s; now the love of God is &s;hed abroad in his heart by the holy Spirit, Rom. v. 5. Now he walks in the comforts of the holy Gho&s;t, Acts ix. 13. Now he is filled with joy and peace in believ|ing, Rom. xv. 13. Now he rejoices with joy un|&s;peakable and full of glory, 1 Pet. i. 8. And now he has the Spirit of God bearing witne&s;s with his own &s;pirit, that he is a child of God, Rom. viii. 16. 1 John
<PB N="6" REF="012832_0005_0F8B404DE3A726C8">
v. 10.&mdash;The&s;e are things which I was an utter &s;tran|ger to before, notwith&s;tanding all my reading, watch|ing and praying; and the&s;e are things that every one mu&s;t be a &s;tranger to, till he is made a child of God by faith in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</P>
<P>But to proceed; though a believer is continually more and more &s;anctified, "in body, &s;oul and &s;pirit," yet his hopes of heaven are not built on his &s;anctificati|on, but on Chri&s;t; he knows he is only complete in Chri&s;t, Col. ii. 10. And that the moment he &s;eeks to be ju&s;tified by his own obedience to God's law, that moment he falls from Chri&s;t and cea&s;es to have an in|tere&s;t in him, Gal. v. 4. Accordingly, though he la|bours to abound in all the fruits of righteou&s;ne&s;s, yet, like St. Paul, he de&s;ires to be found only in Chri&s;t, not having [i. e. not relying on] his own righteou&s;ne&s;s, but on the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God by faith, Phil. iii. 8, 9.</P>
<P>And now let me point out to you the grand delu&s;i|on, which had like to have ruined my &s;oul. I &s;aw ve|ry early &s;omething of the unbelief of my nature, and the nece&s;&s;ity of being born again. Accordingly I watch|ed, prayed and fa&s;ted too, thinking to purity my heart by the&s;e means, whereas it can only be purifyed by faith, Acts xv 9. Watching, praying and fa&s;ting are nece&s;|&s;ary duties, but I, like many others, placed &s;ome &s;ecret reliances on them, thinking they were to do that for me, in part at lea&s;t, which Chri&s;t only could. The truth is, though I &s;aw my&s;elf to be a &s;inner, and a great &s;inner, yet I did not &s;ee my&s;elf an utter lo&s;t &s;in|ner, and therefore I could not come to Je&s;us Chri&s;t a|lone to &s;ave me; de&s;pi&s;ed the doctrine of ju&s;tification by faith alone, looking on it as a fooli&s;h and a danger|ous doctrine; I was not yet &s;tript of all my righteou&s;|ne&s;s, could not con&s;ider it as "filthy rags," and there|fore
<PB N="7" REF="012832_0005_0F8B404DE3A726C8">
I went about to e&s;tabli&s;h a righteou&s;ne&s;s of my own; and did not &s;ubmit to the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God by faith, Rom. x. 3 &mdash;I did not &s;eek after righteou&s;|ne&s;s through faith, but, as it were, by the works of the law. Thus I &s;tumbled and fell, Rom. ix. 31, 32. In &s;hort, to u&s;e a homely &s;imilitude, I put the ju&s;tice of God in one &s;cale, and as many good works of my own as I could in the other, and when I found, as I always did, my own good works not to be a ballance to the divine ju&s;tice, I then threw in Chri&s;t as a make-weight. And this every one really does, who hopes for &s;alvation partly by doing what he can for him&s;elf, and then relying on Chri&s;t for the re&s;t.</P>
<P>But, dear Sir, Chri&s;t will be either a whole Saviour, or none at all. And if you think you have any good &s;ervice of your own to recommend you unto God, you are certainly without any intere&s;t in Chri&s;t. Be you ever &s;o &s;ober, &s;erious, ju&s;t and devout; you are &s;till un|der the cur&s;e of God as I was, and know it not, pro|vided you have any allowed reliance on your own works, and think they are to do &s;omething for you, and Chri&s;t to do the re&s;t.</P>
<P>I now proceed to acquaint you with the &s;ucce&s;s I have lately had in my mini&s;try. As &s;oon as God had opened my eyes, and &s;hewed me the true way to &s;al|vation, I began immediately to preach it And now I dealt with my hearers in a very different manner from what I u&s;ed to do. I told them very plainly, that they were children of wrath and under the cur&s;e of God, though they knew it not, and that none but Je&s;us Chri&s;t could deliver them from that Cur&s;e. I a&s;ked them if they had ever broke the law of God once, in thought, word or deed? If they had, they were un|der the cur&s;e: For it is written, "Cur&s;ed is every one
<PB N="8" REF="012832_0006_0F8B404F740667B8">
that continueth not in all the things that are written in the book of the law to do them." And again, "he that keepeth the whole law, and yet offendeth in one point, is guilty of all." If, indeed, we could keep the whole law, without offending in one point; if we had done, and could continue to do all things in God's law, then we might lay claim to eternal life on the &s;core of our own works. "But who is &s;ufficient for the&s;e things?" If we break God's law, we immediately fall under the cur&s;e of it, and none can deliver us from this cur&s;e but Je|&s;us Chri&s;t. There is an end for ever after, of any ju&s;|tification from our own works. No future good be|haviour can make any atonement for pa&s;t mi&s;carriages. If I keep all God's law to day, this is no amends for breaking them ye&s;terday. If therefore I am once un|der the cur&s;e of God, for having broken God's law, I can never after do any thing of my&s;elf to deliver me from this cur&s;e. I may then <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">, "O! wretched man that I am, who &s;hall deliver <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> from this body of &s;in?" And find none able to deliver, but Je&s;us Chri&s;t, Rom. vii. 24, 25. So that if I am once a &s;in|ner, nothing but the blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t can clean&s;e me from &s;in. All my hopes are then in him, and I mu&s;t fly to him as the only "refuge &s;et before me."</P>
<P>In this manner, dear Sir, I preached, and do preach to my people, labouring to bring them off from &s;elf-righteou&s;ne&s;s to a dependance on Chri&s;t's righteou&s;ne&s;s only for ju&s;tification, in the &s;ight of God: labouring to &s;hew them that they were all in a lo&s;t and peri&s;hing &s;tate, and that nothing could recover them out of this &s;tate, and make them children of God, but faith in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. And now &s;ee the con&s;equence. This was &s;trange doctrine to my hearers. They were &s;ur|prized, all armed and vexed. The old man, the car|nal
<PB N="9" REF="012832_0006_0F8B404F740667B8">
nature was &s;tirred up, and railed and oppo&s;ed the truth. However, the minds of mo&s;t were &s;eized with &s;ome convictions, and the hearts of &s;ome were truly broken for &s;in, &s;o that they came to me, as tho&s;e men|tioned in the Acts, 'pricked to the heart,' and crying out, "What mu&s;t I do to be &s;aved?" I then laid the promi&s;es before them, and told them, if they found them&s;elves under the cur&s;e, Chri&s;t was ready to deliver them from it; if they were really weary and heavy laden, Chri&s;t would give them re&s;t; if their hearts were broken for their &s;ins, and they would look up unto Chri&s;t he would heal them. I exhorted them al&s;o to thank God for the&s;e convictions, a&s;&s;uring them it was a token of good to their &s;ouls. For God mu&s;t fir&s;t &s;mite the heart before he can heal it, I&s;a. xix. 22. I generally found that they received comfort from the promi&s;es of God in his word; and though they com|plained much of the burden of &s;in, and of an evil heart of unbelief, yet they always went away refre&s;hed and comforted. The good fruits begin now to appear, not a few rejoice in Chri&s;t and love him; they love his word, and meditate in it; they exerci&s;e them&s;elves in prayer, and adorn their profe&s;&s;ion by a &s;uitable life and conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>And now let me make one reflection. I preached up &s;anctification very earne&s;tly as (as above mentioned) for eight years, and never brought one &s;oul to Chri&s;t, never had &s;ucce&s;s at all; but as &s;oon as ever I preached Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and faith in his blood, then conviction of &s;in took place in the hearers hearts, yea, and believers were, every now and then, added to the church And now let me a&s;k, what is the rea&s;on why my mi|ni&s;try was not ble&s;&s;ed, when I preached up &s;alvation partly by faith, and partly by works? It is becau&s;e
<PB N="10" REF="012832_0007_0F8B4051775AAB68">
this doctrine is not of God; and he will pro&s;per not mini&s;ters but &s;uch as preach &s;alvation in his own ap|pointed way, [viz] by faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Let me now apply my&s;elf to your own heart, and may God di&s;po&s;e you to receive my words in the &s;pi|rit of meekne&s;s. Indeed, Sir, I love and re&s;pect you, el&s;e I could not have wrote to you &s;o freely. Are you then in the &s;ame error that I was in for near forty years, [viz] that you mu&s;t be &s;aved partly by faith, and partly by works? And have you con&s;tantly preached this doctrine? Then you may be certainly a&s;&s;ured of the&s;e two things; fir&s;t, that you never yet brought one &s;oul to Chri&s;t, by your mini&s;try. And &s;econdly, that you are not yet in the way of &s;alvation your&s;elf. Oh! be not di&s;plea&s;ed with me for telling you the truth.&mdash;But you will &s;ay perhaps, that you have not only been &s;in|cere, but ever zealous in preaching the word of God. So was I; but there is a zeal which is not according to knowledge, and that zeal I had, though I knew it not. You may &s;ay farther, that you have read and prayed much, &s;o have I, but &s;till 'I knew nothing as I ought to know,' till God was plea&s;ed to &s;hew me that I was blind, and then I cried heartily to him for light and di|rection, and he opened mine eyes, John ix. 39.</P>
<P>Dear Sir, will you attend to the following advice? it is very &s;afe advice, be the &s;tate of your &s;oul what it will. Pray to God to lead you into the knowledge of the truth as it is in Je&s;us. Be&s;eech God to keep you in the truth, if you have received it; or if you are in er|ror, to reveal it unto you If you will do this heartily and con&s;tantly, God will not &s;uffer you to abide in darkne&s;s, if, indeed, you are in darkne&s;s, Jam i. 5.</P>
<P>I now proceed to give you &s;ome account of my&s;elf, and of the impediments which kept me from the truth.
<PB N="11" REF="012832_0007_0F8B4051775AAB68">
When I fir&s;t went to the College, I applied my&s;elf di|ligently to my &s;tudies, thinking human learning to be the chief, if not the only nece&s;&s;ary qualification for a divine. Accordingly I &s;tudied the Cla&s;&s;ics, Mathematicks, Ethics, Logics, Metaphy&s;ics, and read the works of our mo&s;t eminent Divines; and this I did for twenty years; and all the while was departing more and more from 'the truth as it is in Je&s;us;' vainly hoping to receive light and in&s;truction from human wi&s;dom, which could on|ly be had from the word and Spirit of God.</P>
<P>During this time, I was thought one of the true mi|ni&s;ters of Chri&s;t by &s;ome people, only becau&s;e I was a little more grave, and took a little more pains in my mini&s;try than &s;ome others of my brethren; but, in truth, I was not, I was an utter &s;tranger to the doc|trines of their ma&s;ter, which they preached as well as to Chri&s;t him&s;elf in my heart and could not abide the doctrine of ju&s;tification by faith, in particular. But when God was plea&s;ed to open mine eyes about half a year ago, he &s;hewed and taught me other things. Now I &s;aw that nothing had kept me &s;o much from the truth, as a de&s;ire of human wi&s;dom. Now I perceived that it was as difficult for a wi&s;e or learned man to be &s;aved, as it was for a rich man; or nobleman: 1 Cor. i. 26. Now I &s;aw that God even &s;till cho&s;e the fool|i&s;h things of this world to confound the wi&s;e, and the weak things to confound the mighty, for two plain rea&s;ons, 1&s;t, that no fle&s;h &s;hould glory in his pre&s;ence, ver. 29. and 2d. to &s;hew that faith did not &s;tand in or was not produced by the wi&s;dom of man, but by the power of God, 1 Cor. ii. 5. Now I di&s;cerned, that no one could under&s;tand the word of God, but by the Spirit of God, 1 Cor. ii. 12. Now I &s;aw that every be|liever in Chri&s;t was anointed by the holy Spirit of God,
<PB N="12" REF="012832_0008_0F8B40521ED3B558">
and thereby led to the knowledge of all needful truths, 1 John ii. 20. Now I &s;aw that Ju&s;tification by faith alone was a fundamental doctrine of chri&s;tianity; and did no longer wonder at the want of &s;ucce&s;s in tho&s;e mini&s;ters who did not preach this in particular, and the other fundamental doctrines of go&s;pel. They preach|ed not Chri&s;t's doctrine, and Chri&s;t owned it not. I once neither believed nor preached Ju&s;tification by faith only, yea, what was more dreadful, I was undermining this fundamental doctrine, and yet dreadful as this is, I fear it is the ca&s;e of too many of the clergy in this kingdom. Scarce any thing is preached but ju&s;tifica|tion by faith and works, at be&s;t. And what is the con|&s;equence? Why there is &s;carce any true religion a|mong us, the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t is not truly preached by us, and Chri&s;t will not own our mini&s;try. Look around the Pari&s;hes which are near you, and &s;ee whether you can find any thing be&s;ides the form of religion, and not much of that. Nay, among&s;t tho&s;e who are thought religious people; who are &s;ober, &s;erious, ju&s;t and de|vout; who read and pray, and give alms, and even fa&s;t; among&s;t the&s;e you will &s;carce find one who knows any thing of the power of religion, and has experimental knowledge of it. For if you a&s;k &s;uch people in the very words of &s;cripture, "whether they know that Je|&s;us Chri&s;t is in them, otherwi&s;e they are reprobates," 2 Cor. xiii. 5. Whether Chri&s;t dwells in their hearts by faith, Eph. iii. 17. Whether their &s;ins are forgiven for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, John ii. 12. Whether they have re|ceived an unction from the holy One, 1 John ii. 20. Whether the love of God has been &s;hed abroad in their hearts by the holy Gho&s;t, Rom. v. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">. Whether they are filled with joy and peace in believing, Rom. xv. 13. Whether they walk in the comfort of the holy Gho&s;t,
<PB N="13" REF="012832_0008_0F8B40521ED3B558">
and do ever rejoice with joy un&s;peakable and full of glory, Acts ix. 31. 1 Pet. i. 8. And la&s;tly, whether the Holy Spirit bears witne&s;s with their own &s;pirit that they are the children of God, Rom. viii. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">4. &amp;c. If, I &s;ay, you a&s;k the better &s;ort among us, whether they have any experience of the&s;e matters. they would &s;tare at you with the utmo&s;t amazement, and would think you an Enthu&s;ia&s;t, if they did not call you &s;o. Or, at mo&s;t, they would have expected to be enquired at ra|ther about the orthodoxy of the head, than about the&s;e experiences which re&s;ide in the heart alone, as being fuller of that than the other. Now &s;uch people who are only orthodox, and &s;uch who have all the form, but none of the power of religion, who are outwardly reformed but not inwardly renewed by the Holy Gho&s;t. The&s;e la&s;t are what our Saviour calls "whited &s;epul|chres," beautiful without, but full of rottenne&s;s with|in; the&s;e are "&s;triving to enter into the kingdom of heaven, but are not able," becau&s;e they do not "&s;trive lawfully:" for they do not &s;eek to enter in through Je|&s;us Chri&s;t, but partly through Chri&s;t, and partly thro' them&s;elves, partly by faith, and partly (if not wholly) by works, and they fir&s;t make a Chri&s;t of their ortho|doxy, make it to be 'all in all,' to &s;upply the place of heart-Religion and holine&s;s of life. And even when the&s;e two<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Orthodoxy and out&s;ide Religion.</NOTE> are found joined in any, it makes them but almo&s;t chri&s;tians. And if at any time it happens, that &s;ome are &s;eized with deep convictions, and are made &s;en&s;ible of their utter need of Chri&s;t, and that they can only be ju&s;tified by faith in his blood; the&s;e not find|ing proper food for their &s;ouls from one mini&s;ter, are obliged with tho&s;e people who have from time to time been brought into the &s;ame &s;tate of &s;oul, to go and hear another that preaches the true go&s;pel, where they can
<PB N="14" REF="012832_0009_0F8B405261206090">
find him. This is often the ca&s;e, &s;o &s;carce are go&s;pel mini&s;ters nowadays. It is no wonder therefore that there are &s;o few real chri&s;tians. If you read the fathers of the church, if you read the works of our good old reformers, and works that were publi&s;hed a hundred years ago, you will there find the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t preached, and the true doctrines of Prote&s;tants. But &s;ince that time, I mean in the la&s;t Century, the clergy, e&s;pecially of the church of England, have been gradu|ally departing more and more from this go&s;pel and tho&s;e doctrines; &s;o that at length there were few clergymen to be found in England but who preached contrary to them. And almo&s;t all the &s;ermons that have been publi&s;hed in the la&s;t century,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Meaning the &s;ame as referred to in the la&s;t note.</NOTE> are full of that &s;oul-de|&s;troying doctrine, that we are to be ju&s;tified either partly by our own works, and partly by Chri&s;t's merits, or by the former only.</P>
<P>Do you a&s;k how the clergy came to fall into this pernicious doctrine? I an&s;wer very ea&s;ily. Every man, whil&s;t he continues under the power of the carnal mind and is not awakened to &s;ee his utter lo&s;t condition, is naturally di&s;po&s;ed to embrace this doctrine. For not being yet convinced by the Spirit of God, that all his righteou&s;ne&s;s is as filthy rags, I&s;a. lxiv. 6. And that he is without help and &s;trength in him&s;elf, Rom. v. 6. I &s;ay, not being convinced of this, he naturally goes a|bout to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;ome righteou&s;ne&s;s of his own, and can|not &s;ubmit to the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God by faith. Not being yet &s;en&s;ible of his utter lo&s;t and helple&s;s &s;tate, he mu&s;t have &s;ome reliance on him&s;elf. And thus in&s;tead of looking wholly to Je&s;us Chri&s;t for &s;alvation, he looks partly to Chri&s;t and partly to him&s;elf: in&s;tead of &s;eek|ing for righteou&s;ne&s;s and &s;trength from the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, he &s;eeks for it partly from Chri&s;t and partly
<PB N="15" REF="012832_0009_0F8B405261206090">
from him&s;elf: in&s;tead of &s;eeking to be ju&s;tified in the Lord, he &s;eeks after ju&s;tification partly thro' the Lord, and partly through him&s;elf. But &s;ee what Chri&s;t &s;aith of this matter, I&s;a. xlv. 23, 23, 24, 25, &amp;c.</P>
<P>And now let me a&s;k, how the whole church of Rome happened to depart from the &s;implicity of the go&s;pel, and to fall into this doctrine of works, which we [the clergy of the church of England and Scotland] now preach. It was owing to the depraved nature of man, which makes him think him&s;elf to be &s;omething and can do &s;omething, though he is nothing and can do no|thing to ju&s;tify him&s;elf in God's &s;ight. At the refor|mation tho&s;e churches returned again to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and pleaded ju&s;tification on the go&s;pel-footing of faith only. And &s;o it continues: but though their Articles [and our confe&s;&s;ion of Faith] continue &s;ound and evan|gelical in this doctrie, [and are in every other doctrine, at lea&s;t, that is e&s;&s;ential to &s;alvation, agreeable to the word of God;] yet their and our clergy have departed once more from them, and are advancing to Rome a|gain in this particular, with ha&s;ty &s;trides; preaching in &s;pite of Articles or Confe&s;&s;ions and &s;ub&s;criptions, that mo&s;t pernicious, Papi&s;tical, and damnable doctrine of Ju&s;tification by faith and works. Which doctrine, I am verily a&s;&s;ured no one can hold, and be in a &s;tate of &s;alvation. Oh, that God would once more vi&s;it in mer|cy the&s;e poor di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Churches!</P>
<P>When I &s;at down to write, I did not intend to have filled more than half a &s;heet, but when I took my Pen in hand, I knew not how to lay it a&s;ide, I have wrote my &s;entiments with great freedom, and I hope without offence.</P>

be his mercy: may he lead you by his Spirit to "the knowledge of the truth as it is in Je&s;us;" and make you in&s;trumental in bringing &s;ouls "from darkne&s;s in|to light," and "tran&s;lating them out of the kingdom of Satan, into the glorious kingdom of his dear Son." AMEN.</P>
