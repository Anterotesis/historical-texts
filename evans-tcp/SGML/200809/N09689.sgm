<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_THE following &s;ermons, compri&s;ed in this &s;mall treati&s;e, were com|po&s;ed and preached at Weymouth, by <HI>JAMES BLAKE,</HI> A. B. of Dor|che&s;ter, a young gentleman, who has for &s;ome time been repo&s;ited in &s;ilence; and it is now nece&s;&s;ary to give &s;ome rea&s;ons why they are made public, and perhaps it may be accepta|ble to the reader to &s;ee a &s;hort character of their author.</P>
<P>He was admitted into Harvard-College, in the fifteenth year of his age, where he ex|hibited an eminent example of &s;tudiou&s;ne&s;s and proficiency in learning. He was free from vice to which many are unhappily addicted, and which is too often prevalent, in &s;uch a &s;ociety of youth. He was greatly e&s;teemed a|mong his cla&s;s-mates, and all the &s;ociety that were familiar with him. He gain'd the good will of his in&s;tructors, and was valued by them as one that greatly ornamented the &s;ociety. Thus he pa&s;&s;ed away his time at College, without the di&s;e&s;teem of any, and commenced Bachelor of arts in the year <HI>1769.</HI>
<PB N="iv" REF="012330_0003_0F88C91D2A46BD18">
From thence he went to Weymouth, and di&s;|charged the office of a School-ma&s;ter to general &s;atisfaction; but that being di&s;agreable to his mind, and &s;o great an impediment to his &s;tudies, that he re&s;igned it in about nine months, and employed him&s;elf wholly in the &s;tudy of divinity, under the in&s;truction of the Rev. Mr. <HI>Smith.</HI> He pur&s;ued this his fa|vorite &s;tudy with unwearied a&s;&s;iduity for a year, and then he began on the important work of the mini&s;try, but not without great reluctance; for he had determined not to preach until he had acquired a perfect know|ledge in the fundamental parts of religion (which cannot be done in the &s;mall &s;pace of a year.) But Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> being &s;ick, he was many times urged to &s;upply his place until he recovered, which (after repeated denials) he did. Thus having made a beginning he con|tinued preaching almo&s;t every &s;abbath until he died. With re&s;pect to his public character, he did not effect to be o&s;tentatious, and to di|vert the minds of his hearers, by a flow of words to little &s;ignificancy, but his main de|&s;ign was to edify them in the way of their duty; accordingly his di&s;cour&s;es were plain and in&s;tructive, his delivery was ea&s;y and agreable, accompanied with a few natural ge&s;tures. With regard to his private cha|racter, he was &s;ober and temperate, friendly
<PB N="v" REF="012330_0003_0F88C91D2A46BD18">
and &s;ociable, and in conver&s;ation entertaining and edifying; to the&s;e was joined an even temper and di&s;po&s;ition of mind, all which made him very agreable. He "per&s;evered in the ways of well doing," 'till he was <HI>21</HI> years old, wanting one month (which was the <HI>17</HI>th day of November <HI>1771</HI>) when after a very &s;hort illne&s;s, his Lord and ma&s;ter, who&s;e glory he was daily endeavouring to advance, was plea&s;ed to &s;ummon him from this &s;inful earth, to receive the reward of his early piety. Thus I have given a &s;hort character of him, and faintly delineated, neverthele&s;s worthy of our imita|tion. And as he has left no i&s;&s;ue to tell po&s;te|rity their lo&s;s, his friends and acquaintance have thought fit to print the following &s;er|mons, that his name may be pre&s;erved in re|membrance, and likewi&s;e that the kingdom of Chri&s;t may be advanced.</P>
<P>Now, Reader, I pre&s;ent the&s;e &s;ermons (without any material alteration) to your peru&s;al. And (after informing you, that they were never &s;tudied with a de&s;ign to be printed, and probably not wrote with &s;o great accuracy as they would have been, had he entertained &s;uch a thought) I &s;incerely hope that the divine ble&s;&s;ing may accompany them, and that hereby, tho&s;e that are dead in tre&s;|pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins, and are not as yet &s;avingly intere&s;ted in Chri&s;t, but are proceeding daily
<PB N="vi" REF="012330_0004_0F88C91DED6093C0">
in the broad way to perdition, and who will &s;hortly, without the &s;overeign influences of God's grace, be forever excluded the man&s;ions of ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, may have a la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ion made on their minds, that their future con|duct may be agreable to the dictates of reli|gion and rea&s;on, and that by their conver&s;a|tion they may abundantly evidence that they are candidates for future glory. And that tho&s;e of you who have an intere&s;t in the &s;u|pereminent joys of the approaching world, may hereby be encouraged to go on cheerfully in your christian walk, and &s;hew forth the virtues of Christ, in each of your daily actions, that your life may terminate in perfect peace and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>And that we may all not only know our duty, but likewi&s;e be diligent in doing of it; that we may increa&s;e daily in grace and in the knowledge of Christ our Saviour, and keep our&s;elves un&s;potted from &s;in; and be circum|&s;pect over our steps, that we may adorn our christian profe&s;&s;ion; &s;o that when we &s;hall have &s;erved our Maker to his acceptance, whether in the bloom of youth, or in more ad|vanced life, we may then be admitted to the &s;upercelestial &s;paces of bli&s;s and immortality, is the &s;incere and hearty de&s;ire of,</P>

<HEAD>SERMON I. The heavenly Country.</HEAD>

<Q><BIBL>HEBREWS XI. 16.</BIBL>
<P>But now they de&s;ire a better Coun|try, that is, an heavenly.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THE whole of this chapter was de|&s;igned by the in&s;pired author of it, to &s;et forth the excellency of faith. He begins with a defini|tion of it, Now faith is the &s;ub&s;tance of things hoped for, &amp;c. and proceeds to bring various in&s;tances from the old Te&s;tament, wherein tho&s;e ancient Patriarchs were &s;up|ported and excited by this divine grace of faith, to do and &s;uffer many excellent things to the advancement of the glory of God, and in obedience to his commands. It was this &s;hining virtue that encouraged Abra|ham,
<PB N="2" REF="012330_0005_0F88C91EA8FB7480">
at the command of God, to leave the place of his nativity, and to &s;ojourn in a &s;trange land, which was promi&s;ed him for a future inheritance. Here, with I&s;aac and Jacob, he dwelt in tabernacles, as a &s;tranger in the land of promi&s;e. The&s;e all died in faith, the apo&s;tle tells us, not having receiv|ed the promi&s;es, but having &s;een them afar off, and were per&s;waded that they &s;hould afterwards be accompli&s;hed. But though the&s;e promi&s;es were not made good during their life; yet by their ready obedience to the commands of God, their faith and reli|ance on his word, and their confe&s;&s;ing that their life on earth was but a pilgrimage, they plainly declared that they &s;ought a country: Yea, &s;aith our text, they de&s;ire a better country, that is, an heavenly. Thus you &s;ee what connection the text has with what goes before. But I &s;hall con&s;ider the words as they are in them&s;elves; and thus they plainly include this</P>

<P>That the &s;aints and people of God, &s;eek after and de&s;ire a better country, even an heavenly one.</P>

</BODY>
</TEXT></P>
<P>This doctrine naturally divides it&s;elf into two parts, which I &s;hall handle di&s;tinctly.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="3" REF="012330_0005_0F88C91EA8FB7480">I. Heaven is a better country. And,</P>
<P N="2">II. The &s;aints and people of God &s;eek after, and de&s;ire it.</P>
<P N="1">1. Heaven is a better country. This I &s;hall attempt to prove by taking a brief &s;ur|vey of the glories of tho&s;e un&s;een man&s;ions, and thereby &s;hewing that the excellency, beauty, and happine&s;s of them, infinitely &s;urpa&s;s the mo&s;t &s;plendid and pro&s;perous condition which can be enjoyed in this world. But alas! what a ta&s;k have I propo&s;ed to undertake? What tongue can utter? What pen can de&s;cribe? Yea, what imagination can comprehend, the tran&s;cendent happine&s;s of tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ed regions, where God &s;hines forth with unvailed lu&s;tre, di&s;plays his un|clouded maje&s;ty, and &s;heds the beams of his beneficence on all that &s;tand around? "Nei|ther eye hath &s;een, nor ear heard, neither hath it entred into the heart of man to con|ceive, the things which God has prepared for them that love him." To de&s;cribe, or even to conceive tho&s;e joys, were a ta&s;k more &s;uited to the capacities of tho&s;e glori|ous angels who re&s;ide in tho&s;e bli&s;sful &s;eats, than for an inhabitant of this lower world.</P>
<P>When we have enlarged our conceptions of their utmo&s;t bounds, and taken in all that our narrow under&s;tandings can com|prehend, &s;till our ideas fall infinitely &s;hort

<P>Heaven, then, is far &s;uperior to this world&punc; as it is a &s;tate of perfect knowledge, perfe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> purity, and perfect happine&s;s.</P>
<P N="1">1. Heaven is a &s;tate of perfect knowledge. Here on earth, as the apo&s;tle &s;aith, "w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="5" REF="012330_0006_0F88C91F6A9D9778">
know but in part," our knowledge of things <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s ob&s;cure and imperfect, "but when that which is perfect is come, then that which is imperfect &s;hall be done away." Here, in this world, we are unavoidably ignorant of many things, &s;ome are too &s;ublime for our comprehen&s;ion, &s;ome are too di&s;tant for our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">each, and many &s;o rare as not to fall under our ob&s;ervation. We labour under many prejudices and fal&s;e conceptions, even of &s;uch things as daily occur to us, and of which we think we have a perfect knowledge. And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> for things &s;ublime and &s;piritual, &s;uch as are not gro&s;s enough to fall under our &s;en&s;es, we either know nothing about them, or our knowledge of them is very ob&s;cure. But in that our happy &s;tate, when we &s;hall have bid adieu to the&s;e our clayey tabernacles, and &s;hall be dive&s;ted of our gro&s;s corporeal &s;en&s;es, we &s;hall behold all things by immediate in|tuition. We &s;hall have nothing to clog and confine our re&s;earches, but our enlarged ca|pacities &s;hall be able fully to comprehend &s;uch things as now appear dark and unintel|ligible. Particularly we &s;hall then be ble&s;&s;ed with the vi&s;ion of God, and &s;hall be able per|fectly to comprehend his infinite nature and perfections. "Now we for him but thro' a gla&s;s darkly, but then face to face." The &s;cripture a&s;&s;ures us that "we &s;hall then with
<PB N="6" REF="012330_0007_0F88C9202A913F50">
open face behold the glory of God, and &s;hall &s;ee him as he is." 1 John 3.2. Here "w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> walk by faith and not by &s;ight." But the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> our faith &s;hall be &s;wallowed up in vi&s;ion, and our hope &s;uper&s;eded by fruition. Here w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ee God only by reflection, as it were, from hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> works, but there we &s;hall have an immedi|ate and direct view of him, "and &s;hall know him even as we are known." Again, how many intricacies and my&s;teries do we daily behold in God's providence, which we can|not now reconcile with his all-holy and per|fect nature, and his concern for the good of man? But in our heavenly &s;tate, all the&s;e perplexing difficulties will be unfolded and made plain to us; we &s;hall then be enabled to view the whole chain of providence to|gether, to di&s;cover the connection of it's &s;e|veral parts, and their dependance upon each other, and perceive that every part, however dubious it might appear alone, is conducive to the good of the whole, and the carrying on of the grand de&s;ign. There we &s;hall &s;ee and acknowledge that it was only our blindne&s;s and ignorance that made us imagine any in|con&s;i&s;tencies in the divine conduct.</P>
<P>Moreover, it is probable that we &s;hall &s;till know and remember our friends and rela|tives, who&s;e company we took plea&s;ure in whil&s;t on earth: For the &s;oul will retain all
<PB N="7" REF="012330_0007_0F88C9202A913F50">
it's former ideas and impre&s;&s;ions, and the de|lights of conver&s;ation will &s;till be continued to us; at lea&s;t &s;o much of the knowledge of our former &s;tate, as is con&s;i&s;tent with the purity of the place, and our happine&s;s there, &s;hall remain with us in tho&s;e heavenly man|&s;ions. From all this we learn that heaven is a better country than the earth, in this re|&s;pect, that the knowledge of glorified &s;pirits &s;o far exceeds the ignorance of mortal men.</P>
<P N="2">2. Heaven is a &s;tate of perfect purity and holine&s;s. "There &s;hall in no wi&s;e enter in|to it any thing that defileth, or that worketh abomination, or that maketh a lie," as we read in the 21&s;t chapter of the Revelations, the 27th ver&s;e. In this world all godly men do mortify their earthly and corrupt affec|tions, and do their utmo&s;t to &s;ubdue all their perver&s;e appetites, and root out all evil in|clinations. But &s;till there remain &s;ome im|perfections and blemi&s;hes in the be&s;t of men. But when they enter the heavenly world, they &s;hall be freed from every taint of &s;in, they &s;hall be "clean&s;ed from all fil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ne&s;s of fle&s;h and &s;pirit," and &s;hall be pure and per|fect like the angels of God, or as the apo&s;tle &s;ays, like God him&s;elf. There, tho&s;e long|ings and breathings after pure and &s;potle&s;s holine&s;s, which they had in this life, &s;hall be fully gratified. There, there will be nothing
<PB N="8" REF="012330_0008_0F88C922C5FCDA28">
to incline or tempt them to any &s;in or impu|rity: But every thing will be agreable to the pure natures and de&s;ires of the inhabitants. There, the fle&s;h will no longer &s;way them to &s;in, nor the world intrude on their divine employments. There, &s;atan &s;hall be di&s;arm|ed of his darts, he &s;hall be rendred incapable of tempting any more; and the de&s;troyer him&s;elf &s;hall be de&s;troyed. Wherefore,</P>
<P N="3">3. Heaven is a &s;tate of perfect joy and happine&s;s. This is the peculiar characteri&s;tic of heaven, but cannot be conceived, much le&s;s de&s;cribed, by us in our pre&s;ent &s;tate; we are only certified of this in general (and this is &s;ufficient to excite our zealous endea|vours to obtain it) that this happine&s;s is great beyond comprehen&s;ion, that it is free from all allay and interruption, that it will be &s;uited to our capacities, and &s;atisfactory to our de&s;ires.</P>
<P>But let us take a more particular view of what may be &s;uppo&s;ed to con&s;titute the hap|pine&s;s of the ble&s;&s;ed inhabitants of heaven.</P>
<P N="1">1. They &s;hall be freed from all tho&s;e evils which attend them here. Men in this life are liable to numberle&s;s evils and ca&s;ualties, fears and torments, which often render life it&s;elf a &s;cene of mi&s;ery and &s;orrow. But tho&s;e that &s;hall be counted worthy to enter into that world &s;hall be delivered from all
<PB N="9" REF="012330_0008_0F88C922C5FCDA28">
tho&s;e annoyances. There, "all &s;ickne&s;s and death, &s;orrow and &s;ighing, &s;hall flee away," and uninterrupted peace, joy and &s;atisfaction, &s;hall come in their &s;tead. This is admirably de&s;cribed by St. John, the favourite apo&s;tle of our Lord, who was favoured with a vi|&s;ion of this heaven of happine&s;s, this new Jeru&s;alem, whil&s;t here on earth, Revelations 21. chap. 2, 3, and 4 ver&s;es. "And I John &s;aw the holy city, new Jeru&s;alem, coming down from God, out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her hu&s;band. And I heard a great voice out of heaven, &s;aying, be|hold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they &s;hall be his people, and God him&s;elf &s;hall be with them, and be their God. And God &s;hall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there &s;hall be no more death, neither &s;orrow, nor crying, neither &s;hall there be any more pain: For the former things are pa&s;&s;ed a|way." It was "&s;in that brought death into the world and all our woes" and afflictions: Wherefore when &s;in is thoroughly purged away, (as it will be before we enter upon the joys of heaven) all the di&s;mal train of di&s;|ea&s;es, pains, and death, &s;hall depart with it. So there will be nothing to allay our happi|ne&s;s, nothing to mole&s;t or di&s;compo&s;e us in our tranquil plea&s;ures.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="10" REF="012330_0009_0F88C92333036ED8">2. Another con&s;tituent of the happine&s;s of heaven will be, the enjoyment of God, the adoration of him, and the execution of his plea&s;ure. If good men take plea&s;ure in wor+&s;hipping God here on earth, and in rendring prai&s;es and thank&s;givings to his name, how much more when they &s;hall have dropt this vile fle&s;h, and are admitted to adore him in his more immediate pre&s;ence? In this im|perfect &s;tate it is impo&s;&s;ible for us to con|ceive or de&s;cribe the plea&s;ure and happine&s;s which all the glorified &s;aints will receive in the enjoyment of God. Doubtle&s;s it will be exceeding great, and worthy the bounteous author of it to be&s;tow. The performance of the divine will, and the celebration of God's goodne&s;s and kindne&s;s in man's re|demption and &s;alvation, will be inconceiv|ably plea&s;ant to the grateful &s;aints of God. And this plea&s;ure will be heightned and in|crea&s;ed, by recounting to each other the di|vine mercies, by wor&s;hipping God in com|pany, and &s;inging &s;ocial hallelujahs to him.</P>
<P>This brings me to con&s;ider the third ingre|dient of the happine&s;s of heaven, namely,</P>
<P N="3">3. The conver&s;ation of angels and &s;pirits of ju&s;t men made perfect. Man is by na|ture formed for &s;ociety. He is &s;o con&s;ti|tuted as to receive &s;atisfaction and plea&s;ure, from conver&s;ation with his fellow creatures.
<PB N="11" REF="012330_0009_0F88C92333036ED8">
E&s;pecially, the &s;aints and people of God here on earth, reap not only much advantage, but great delight and plea&s;ure, from their communion and conver&s;e with each other. It is a plea&s;ing entertainment to the true di&s;|ciples of Je&s;us, to confer together on holy matters, and jointly to exalt and magnify the glory of God for tho&s;e manife&s;tations of his love and kindne&s;s, which are di&s;covered to us in this our limited &s;tate. But how much greater will the mutual plea&s;ure of their conver&s;ation be, when they are enabled to behold, at one view, the whole grand &s;cheme of grace, and to recount to each other the mighty and unde&s;erved benefits re&s;ulting therefrom? How will they admire God's love, and gratefully ble&s;s his name to|gether? This is heaven! This is happine&s;s! Here they will have nothing to interrupt them; no intru&s;ions of the ungodly, no avocations of the world, to di&s;turb them; but they will &s;pend a happy eternity, in mutual fellow&s;hip and communion. And this commerce will not only be maintained by them with one another, but al&s;o with the holy angels, tho&s;e mini&s;tring &s;pirits, who have intere&s;ted them&s;elves in man's welfare, and who will now by their divine conver&s;a|tion, augment their joy and happine&s;s. But that we may have a more perfect idea of
<PB N="12" REF="012330_0010_0F88C923F0DD6E10">
the happine&s;s of the &s;aints in heaven, let us con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="4">4. That after the re&s;urrection and final judgment, the bodies as well as the &s;ouls of the righteous &s;hall participate in the heaven|ly bli&s;s. Their bodies, I &s;ay; not &s;uch vile and corruptible bodies as they are laid in the grave, but they will then undergo a mo&s;t glorious change. We learn from the apo|&s;tle Paul, that when Chri&s;t &s;hall come, "he &s;hall change our vile body, that it may be fa&s;hioned like unto his glorious body." Phil. 3.21. Fle&s;h and blood, &s;ays the apo&s;tle, cannot inherit the kingdom of God. Our bodies in their pre&s;ent gro&s;s and mortal &s;tate, are not &s;u&s;ceptible of that happine&s;s, which is to be enjoyed in the pre&s;ence of God; the effulgence of God's glorious pre&s;ence will be too bright and dazzling for mortal eyes. We cannot in the&s;e bodies &s;ee God's face and live. But at the re&s;urrection, the bodies of &s;aints will be &s;o altered as to be made capable of enjoying a pure, and never|fading felicity, with God their Creator, Re|deemer, and Sanctifier. This change of the body to be rai&s;ed, is thus &s;et forth by the apo&s;tle, 1 Cor. 15.42. <HI>It is &s;own in cor|ruption, it is rai&s;ed in incorruption: It is &s;own in di&s;honour, it is rai&s;ed in glory: It is &s;own in weakne&s;s, it is rai&s;ed in power:
<PB N="13" REF="012330_0010_0F88C923F0DD6E10">
It is &s;own a natural body, it is rai&s;ed a &s;pi|ritual body.</HI> That is, it &s;hall be &s;o purified and refined from all the dregs of matter, that it will de&s;erve the denomination of a &s;pi|rit, rather than of an ordinary body. The&s;e bodies of ours are liable to accidents and di&s;ea&s;es, to corruption and decay; but at the re&s;urrection, "this corruptible mu&s;t put on incorruption, and this mortal mu&s;t put on immortality." They &s;hall be freed from every de&s;tructive quality, and &s;hall be ren|dred active and vigorous, &s;o as to be no im|pediment to the free operation of the &s;oul. Agreable to which our Saviour &s;ays, that the &s;aints at the re&s;urrection, <HI>&s;hall be as the angels of God in heaven.</HI> Mat. 22.30. The bo|dies of the righteous being thus refined, and their &s;ouls purified from all the remainders of &s;in, they &s;hall be admitted to dwell with the Lord both in &s;oul and in body for ever. And,</P>
<P N="5">5. The happine&s;s which they &s;hall there enjoy, &s;hall be full and &s;atisfactory; which cannot be &s;aid of any earthly happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Here in this world we con&s;tantly imagine our&s;elves de&s;titute of &s;omething, which we e&s;teem requi&s;ite to our compleat felicity; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> creates unea&s;ine&s;s and di&s;content. But in heaven our whole capacities of enjoy|ment will be filled, and every de&s;ire will be

&s;atisfied. And though there will be degree of glory and rewards in heaven, (as may b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> argued from many places of &s;cripture) yet this does not hinder but that each one's hap|pine&s;s &s;hall be perfect. For every one will be happy according to their &s;everal capaci|ties of enjoyment. So that nothing &s;hall be wanting to any one to con&s;titute the greate&s;t happine&s;s which he is capable of enjoying. A difference of rewards is evident hence, Holine&s;s is a qualification, yea, and a nece&s;&s;ary ingredient of happine&s;s. Wherefore as there are different degrees of holine&s;s in this life, &s;o there mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be different degrees of happine&s;s in the next. More|over, the felicity of any &s;tate will be greatly increa&s;ed, by a per&s;on's entring upon it from a &s;tate of adver&s;ity and unhappine&s;s. The comparing their former with their pre&s;ent &s;tate, much enhances the value of the latter. Wherefore &s;uch &s;aints as have been per&s;e|cuted and hardly u&s;ed o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th, will more &s;en&s;ibly feel the va&s;tne&s;s and worth of the heavenly enjoyments. Mat. 5.12. Ble&s;&s;ed are ye, &s;ays our Saviour, when men &s;hall revile you, and per&s;ecute you; rejoice, and be exceeding glad; for great is your reward in heaven. But this difference does not hinder (as I &s;aid before) but that the happi|ne&s;s of all &s;hall be complete, and propor|tioned to their de&s;ires and capacities.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="15" REF="012330_0011_0F88C924BA6251D0">6. and la&s;tly. To crown all that has been &s;aid, of the happine&s;s of the ju&s;t, in the king|dom of heaven, let us con&s;ider that this hap|pine&s;s &s;hall be <HI>eternal.</HI> The felicity which they &s;hall enjoy in God's pre&s;ence, &s;hall ne|ver have an end. Whence it is &s;o frequent|ly called in &s;cripture by the name <HI>of eternal life,</HI> and <HI>everla&s;ting life</HI>; (in&s;tances of which are numberle&s;s.) This is nece&s;&s;ary to the perfection of the heavenly felicity. If the &s;aints there were in continual apprehen&s;ion of having an end put to their happine&s;s, how would it damp their joys, and le&s;&s;en their plea&s;ure? But on the contrary, it adds a new reli&s;h to their enjoyments to be a&s;cer|tain'd that they will be immutable, and inter|minable, that they will endure for myriads of ages, and then, be no nearer ending than at fir&s;t. We cannot now form to our&s;elves an adequate idea of this endle&s;s duration. Our finite under&s;tandings cannot compre|hend infinity. But that the heavenly re|wards are perpetual, and without end, is a|bundantly evident from the word of God. St. Peter a&s;&s;ures the &s;aints to whom he wrote, that there is <HI>an inheritance incorruptible, un|defiled, and that fadeth not away, re&s;erved in heaven for them.</HI> 1 Pet. 1.4. The things which are &s;een, and which we now enjoy, are temporal and vani&s;hing; but the things
<PB N="16" REF="012330_0012_0F88C9265699A118">
which are not &s;een, &amp; which &s;hall &s;ucceed this tran&s;itory &s;tate, are never-ending and eternal&punc; Thus I have given you &s;ome faint de&s;cripti|on of the matchle&s;s glories, and unparallell'd happine&s;s of the heavenly kingdom: But how weak are all de&s;criptions compared with the joys them&s;elves! The repre&s;entation which I have made of them, bears but a faint re&s;em|blance of the reality. I have endeavour'd, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> far as my rea&s;on, and the word of God would conduct me, to decypher this happine&s;s to you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> And what I have &s;aid is &s;ufficient to call forth our &s;tronge&s;t de&s;ires and mo&s;t zealous en|deavours, to attain the&s;e glorious rewards. That which is beyond the comprehen&s;ion of our pre&s;ent faculties, we mu&s;t patiently leave, until God &s;hall &s;ee fit, of his abundant grace, and through the merits of Chri&s;t, to call us (after we have done o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> utmo&s;t to qualify our&s;elves) to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e tran&s;cendent enjoyments. We &s;hall then doubtle&s;s be ready to &s;ay, as the Queen of Sheba to King Solomon, <HI>Behold the half was not told us!</HI> The glories and excellencies, which we now behold, far exceed the utmo&s;t that we ever heard or conceived of them.</P>
<P>I now proceed according to my fir&s;t pro|po&s;ed de&s;ign briefly to con&s;ider the &s;econd part of the doctrine contained in the text, namely,</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="17" REF="012330_0012_0F88C9265699A118">II. That the &s;aints and people of God de&s;ire, and &s;trive after heaven, that better country. But now they de&s;ire a better country, that is, an heavenly. This life they e&s;teem but a pilgrimage, or journey to another. They find nothing in this world worthy to engage their &s;upreme affections: Nothing that is able to &s;atisfy the de&s;ires of a rational and immortal &s;oul. They look down on all the&s;e worldly vanities with in|difference, and &s;oar aloft to tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ed re|gions of glory, where are tran&s;cendent re|wards prepared for them. Thus they de|&s;ire and &s;eek after heaven.</P>
<P N="1">1. As their thoughts and conver&s;ation center in that ble&s;&s;ed place. The plea&s;ures of a virtuous cour&s;e, the plea&s;ures to be found in the &s;ervice of God, and the glorious end of their godly race, are continually in their thoughts. They are con&s;tantly meditating on heaven, and the rewards that God has there prepared for them that love him. Heaven is the object of their contemplations, and it is this that influences them, in all their acti|ons. So that "their conver&s;ation is in hea|ven," whil&s;t they dwell here on earth. All their words and &s;peeches evidently manife&s;t their heavenly temper, and &s;hew their ar|dent love to God, and their pious endea|vours to plea&s;e him. From the&s;e they de|rive
<PB N="18" REF="012330_0013_0F88C926EA497C38">
a mo&s;t &s;ublime and god-like plea&s;ure; living in a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the favor of God here, and a comforting and well-grounded hope of his approbation in the world to come.</P>
<P N="2">2. The de&s;ires and affections of the godly are aimed at heaven. God and Chri&s;t are the objects of their love, they therefore often ardently wi&s;h to depart hence, that they may be with Chri&s;t which is far the be&s;t of all; with that mighty &s;aint and holy apo&s;tle Paul, they <HI>know that when their earthly hou&s;e of this tabernacle &s;hall be di&s;&s;olved, they have a building with God, an hou&s;e not made with hands eternal in the heavens.</HI> And there|fore <HI>for this they groan earne&s;tly, de&s;iring to be cloathed upon with their hou&s;e which is from heaven.</HI> 2 Cor. 5.12. They are wil|ling, and chu&s;e rather to be ab&s;ent from the body, to ca&s;t off this vile body with all it's &s;inful in&s;tigations, with all it's pains and &s;or|rows, mi&s;eries and di&s;quiets, and to be pre|&s;ent with the Lord, to behold his glory, and wor&s;hip in his pre&s;ence through eternal ages. Though they enjoy here the ble&s;&s;ings of a compo&s;ed mind, and peaceful con&s;cience, yet they feel that their happine&s;s on earth is in|complete. Tho' to them, to live be Chri&s;t, yet to die will be &s;till greater gain. This cau&s;es them to de&s;pi&s;e all earth's un&s;atisfying enjoyments, and excite their longings and breathings after heaven.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="19" REF="012330_0013_0F88C926EA497C38">3. Not only their thoughts and affections are placed on heaven, but all their actions likewi&s;e are ordered with a view to the ob|taining of tho&s;e glorious rewards. This is the principle of their conduct, this the &s;pring from whence their actions flow, and the ob|ject at which they aim. Tho&s;e who are thus heavenly di&s;po&s;ed, will be careful "to deny ungodline&s;s, and every worldly lu&s;t, and to live &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly and godly, in this pre&s;ent evil world," knowing that the&s;e are nece&s;&s;ary qualifications for their admittance into heaven. It is not a vain and fruitle&s;s wi&s;hing to enjoy heaven, nor a bare a&s;&s;ent to the truths of the go&s;pel, that will procure an entrance into tho&s;e bli&s;sful man&s;ions. But all that hope for admittance there, mu&s;t be careful to live a godly life, and to practice all tho&s;e duties that are required in the go&s;|pel, as evidences of their being in a &s;tate of ju&s;tification and &s;alvation. Belief is in order to practice, and the one is vain without the other. All therefore who are truly pious, and who &s;incerely &s;trive after heaven, are careful &s;o to order their conver&s;ation here, as to be qualified for happine&s;s hereafter. And thus mu&s;t all do, that de&s;ire to be godly. Thus I have &s;hewn, that it is the character of the &s;aints, to de&s;ire and &s;trive after hea|ven. All that now remains for me to do,
<PB N="20" REF="012330_0014_0F88C927C9D549C8">
is to draw &s;ome u&s;eful and practical infer|ences from the whole.</P>
<P>Inference 1&s;t. Hence we &s;ee the vanity of this world, and it's in&s;ufficiency to make us happy. Though a man be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the good things of this life: Though he have attain'd to the highe&s;t pitch of affluence, and is dignified with all the honour and power his ambition could crave: Though he have riches unnumbered, and all worldly plea&s;ures at his command; yet with the&s;e only, how far is he from happine&s;s? There &s;till remains &s;ome void in his brea&s;t, &s;ome de&s;ire which the&s;e things are not able to &s;atisfy. Be&s;ides, the&s;e outward things are fading and tran&s;i|tory, they vani&s;h like a &s;hadow and leave no trace behind them. And tho' they &s;hould be continued to a man as long as his frail and brittle life la&s;ts, yet how &s;hort is that? What a poor compen&s;ation will the&s;e fleeting and un&s;atisfactory plea&s;ures make for the lo&s;s of happine&s;s to all eternity? It becomes us therefore to draw off our affections from the things of this world, &amp; place them on heaven; to look upon this life as a journey to another; to be indifferent to the things of earth, and to &s;hew by all our actions that we are aiming at a better country, even a heavenly one.</P>
<P N="2">2. The con&s;ideration of tho&s;e bright and glorious rewards, prepared for the ju&s;t in
<PB N="21" REF="012330_0014_0F88C927C9D549C8">
heaven, &s;hould excite our thankfulne&s;s, and draw forth our prai&s;es to God, for &s;uch un|merited goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>We by our &s;ins have &s;ubjected our&s;elves to the cur&s;e of God's broken law, and it had been no breach of ju&s;tice in him, to have per|mitted the eternal puni&s;hment, annexed to the violation of it, to have fallen upon us. But ble&s;&s;ed be his name, he has not left us to our own ruin; he has promi&s;ed us par|don upon our repentance; the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Spirit upon our weak endeavours; and eternal life upon our per&s;everance in good|ne&s;s. Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and gave his Son to die for us, to procure for us the pardon of our &s;ins, and to open to us the gates of hea|ven. O let God's love and mercy to us, en|kindle our love to him: And let us manife&s;t our gratitude, by our prai&s;es and thank&s;giv|ings; and not only &s;o, but by embracing tho&s;e offers of grace, by performing the will of God, and laying hold on eternal life.</P>
<P N="3">3. This thought, that there is a crown of glory prepared in heaven for the godly, which God the righteous judge will &s;hortly be&s;tow upon them, &s;hould &s;erve to &s;upport them under all the pre&s;&s;ures and calamities of life.</P>
<P>Though their circum&s;tances be low in the world, though they be de&s;titute of the comfort|able enjoyments in this life, though they be
<PB N="22" REF="012330_0015_0F88C92869C50DE0">
exerci&s;ed with pains and afflictions, and tho' &s;uffer per&s;ecution from the ungodly, yet let them con&s;ider that they &s;hall &s;hortly be freed from them, that they &s;hall &s;oon be admitted to the rewards of their &s;ufferings, and the hap|pine&s;s of heaven, which will even be aug|mented by them. With the&s;e thoughts let them comfort them&s;elves, and <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;s their &s;ouls in patience. For I reckon,</HI> &s;aith the a|po&s;tle, <HI>that the &s;ufferings of this pre&s;ent time, are not worthy to be compared with the glory that &s;hall be revealed in us.</HI> Tho&s;e who die in the Lord &s;hall re&s;t in their labours. The grave will be to the godly a place of quiet: <HI>There the wicked cea&s;e from troubling: There the weary are at re&s;t. There the pri|&s;oners re&s;t together, they hear not the voice of the oppre&s;&s;or. The &s;mall and the great are there, and the &s;ervant is free from his ma&s;ter,</HI> as Job elegantly expre&s;&s;es it, 3d chap. 17, 18, and 19 ver&s;es. Surely then they have no rea&s;on to complain or to be impatient under the evils of this life, &s;ince they will be &s;o very &s;hort, and will be followed with &s;uch great and inconceivable rewards. E&s;pecially when the apo&s;tle tells them, that "the&s;e light afflictions, which are but for a moment, &s;hall work for them a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory." 2 Cor. 4.17. By thus quietly &s;ubmitting to the troubles and
<PB N="23" REF="012330_0015_0F88C92869C50DE0">
cro&s;&s;es of life, we imitate our ble&s;&s;ed ma&s;ter, "who for the joy that was &s;et before him, endured the cro&s;s, de&s;pi&s;ing the &s;hame." But to proceed,</P>
<P N="4">4. From what has been &s;aid, of the purity and holine&s;s of heaven, we learn the nece&s;&s;ity of our being holy here, in order to our be|ing happy there. Such as are <HI>pure in heart,</HI> and only &s;uch, <HI>&s;hall inherit the kingdom of God.</HI> "Without holine&s;s, &s;ays the apo&s;tle, no man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord." Wherefore if we ever would get to heaven, we mu&s;t, thro' the aids of the divine Spirit, renounce all our carnal affections, &s;ubdue all our depraved ap|petites and inclinations, mortify all our lu&s;ts and corruptions, and clean&s;e our&s;elves from all impurities of thought, word and deed. This, in the very nature of the thing, is re|qui&s;ite to make us capable of enjoying the happine&s;s of heaven. For if we &s;hould &s;up|po&s;e a wicked man to be admitted into hea|ven, in the temper with which he left the earth, with all his grovelling de&s;ires, and carnal affections about him; heaven it&s;elf would be no heaven to him. He would have no reli&s;h for the &s;ublime and &s;piritual joys of that place. He would take no plea&s;ure in the fellow&s;hip of God, who&s;e nature is &s;o oppo&s;ite to his. And the &s;ociety of the ju&s;t would afford him no delight: For they be|ing
<PB N="24" REF="012330_0016_0F88C92B393D2AF0">
&s;anctified, and purified from all filthine&s;s, their conver&s;ation and employment will be wholly about things pure and &s;piritual, and &s;o will afford no &s;atisfaction to the impure de&s;ires, and carnal propen&s;ions of a wicked man. In fine, he would find there nothing &s;uited to his depraved ta&s;te, nothing to gra|tify his corrupt inclinations, and &s;o he would properly be in hell, though in the man&s;ions of the ble&s;&s;ed. Thus we &s;ee it is not &s;o much the place it&s;elf, as the temper of the inhabitants, that con&s;titutes the happine&s;s of heaven. So that if we ever expect to enjoy happine&s;s in heaven, we mu&s;t acquire a hea|venly temper here below: The latter is both a natural, and moral qualification for the former; a natural, as it fits us for enjoying this happine&s;s, and a moral, as it is required by God as a condition of our being admit|ted to it.</P>
<P N="5">5. This doctrine affords us ample encou|ragement, to zeal and faithfulne&s;s in the &s;er|vice of God. There is an ample reward offer|ed to them that do well, no le&s;s than an eter|nity of happine&s;s. This will be conferred on all the true &s;ervants of Chri&s;t; and &s;uch as have mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves in &s;erving God and doing good, to their brethren, &s;hall be ble&s;&s;ed with a more di&s;tingui&s;hing re|ward. Wherefore let us with a holy emu|lation,
<PB N="25" REF="012330_0016_0F88C92B393D2AF0">
&s;trive to outvie each other in our re|ligious cour&s;e. Let us &s;truggle, and &s;trive with all our might, diligently to do God's will, that great may be our reward in hea|ven. More e&s;pecially let us do all the good we can to the &s;ouls of men, let us do our ut|mo&s;t to procure the &s;alvation of our bre|thren; re&s;ting a&s;&s;ured, that after the re&s;ur|rection, <HI>They that be wi&s;e &s;hall &s;hine as the brightne&s;s of the firmament, and they that turn many to righteou&s;ne&s;s, as the &s;tars for ever and ever.</HI> Dan. 12.3.</P>
<P>Finally. Let us (as we have heard that the people of God do) long and &s;eek after this heavenly country. Let us &s;oar above the tri|fling plea&s;ures of this world, and fix our minds on heaven the habitation of God. Let us always keep heaven in our eye; let our &s;u|preme affections be placed on this; and let all our actions tend to this. Let us improve the price put into our hands. Let us &s;eize the pre&s;ent opportunity, and lay hold on e|ternal life: Let us live as tho&s;e that expect a future bli&s;s: Let us con&s;ecrate our lives, our faculties, and all that we are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, to the &s;ervice of our Creator, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ful author of our happine&s;s.

<P>_THERE is no que&s;tion of &s;o great importance for a rational and im|mortal &s;oul to a&s;k, as that of the Jailor, "What &s;hall I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to be &s;aved?" This is the grand &s;tudy, and en|quiry of every pious and under&s;tanding man; being that, on the right re&s;olving of which an eternity of happine&s;s depends. It was to clear up this important point, that the Son
<PB N="28" REF="012330_0018_0F88C92C2C70DC90">
of God him&s;elf came down from heaven; and by his doctrines, precepts, and example, pointed out the only effectual way, whereby mankind can e&s;cape the pollutions of the world, and attain the regions of eternal bli&s;s. And in order to the in&s;truction of after ages, he has left behind him the &s;acred records of his will, written by holy men under the di|rection and in&s;piration of his ble&s;&s;ed Spirit, that none might be ignorant of the way of &s;alvation, wrought out and revealed by him. "Thus has Chri&s;t Je&s;us aboli&s;hed death, and brought life and immortality to light by the go&s;pel." Mankind being &s;inners, there ap|pears no way to una&s;&s;i&s;ted rea&s;on, whereby God can, con&s;i&s;tent with the honor of his perfections and laws, overlook their tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions, and receive them into favour and happine&s;s with him&s;elf. But in con&s;ulting the go&s;pel revelation, how are we &s;urpri&s;ed to find, that God has in infinite wi&s;dom con|trived, and in infinite mercy revealed and executed a plan of grace, whereby all his glo|rious attributes &s;hine un&s;ullied, and yet man|kind is put into a capacity of obtaining eter|nal &s;alvation.? For "God &s;o loved the world as to &s;end his only begotten Son," &amp;c. This is an unde&s;erved favour. The free gift of God&mdash;as is declared by the apo&s;tle in the text. By grace are ye &s;aved, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="012330_0018_0F88C92C2C70DC90">The apo&s;tle begins this chapter by &s;hew|ing the Ephe&s;ians what a deplorable &s;ituation they were in, before they were quickned by divine grace. He de&s;cribes them as "dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins&mdash;walking according to the cour&s;e of this world, and according to the prince of the power of the air&mdash;having their conver&s;ation in the lu&s;ts of the fle&s;h, fulfilling the de&s;ires of the fle&s;h and of the mind&mdash;and being by nature children of wrath." "<HI>But</HI>" proceeds the apo&s;tle, "God who is rich in mercy, for his great love where|with he loved us, even when we were dead in &s;ins, hath quickned us together with Chri&s;t, has rai&s;ed us up, and has made us &s;it toge|ther in heavenly places in Chri&s;t Je&s;us." So that it was owing to the free grace of God alone, that they were renewed in the temper of their minds, and from a &s;tate of expo&s;ed|ne&s;s to the divine wrath, and eternal death, were brought into a &s;tate of &s;alvation. This is more fully declared in the text, wherein we are told, that the &s;alvation of believers is of the free grace of God, and that the qua|lification herefor on their part, is faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t. From the words I &s;hall at|tempt the&s;e three things.</P>

<P N="1">1. I am to &s;hew that it is of the free grace of God alone that any are &s;aved. By grace are ye &s;aved, &amp;c. It was the uncon&s;trained benevolence of the divine nature, that pub|li&s;hed the tenders of mercy, and made eter|nal life obtainable by us. It is a free and un|&s;ollicited favour, to which God had no ex|traneous motives or excitements, nothing but his benevolence and good will. "He fir&s;t loved us," and that when by &s;in we had re|belled again&s;t him. We being &s;inners and could do nothing to call forth the divine mercy, there was nothing in us but our mi&s;|ery to move his pity and compa&s;&s;ion. Our ju&s;tification therefore and &s;alvation is often called by St. Paul, "the free gift." Which &s;eems at fir&s;t &s;ight in &s;ome mea&s;ure to op|po&s;e or interfere with this, are <HI>the &s;atisfacti|on of Chri&s;t,</HI> and <HI>the doings of our own?</HI> But neither of the&s;e de&s;troy the freene&s;s of God's grace in our &s;alvation. For,</P>
<P N="1">1. Though it is granted that Chri&s;t made full atonement for our offences, and &s;o paid down our ran&s;om for us, yet neverthele&s;s it is of the free grace of God that we are ju&s;ti|fied and &s;aved. For it was God him&s;elf that
<PB N="31" REF="012330_0019_0F88C92CEB4EA3B0">
provided a Saviour for us. From motives of love and kindne&s;s only, he gave this un&s;peak|able gift of a redeemer to the world, that there|by he might &s;hew mercy to us con&s;i&s;tent with the honour of his perfections. So that the mediation of Chri&s;t, and all that he did and &s;uffered for us, is to be con&s;idered only as the <HI>means</HI> made u&s;e of by God in ex|ecuting his &s;cheme of mercy, and not as the motive that prompted him to &s;hew mercy to man: It is not the cau&s;e, but the fruit and con&s;equence of the exertion of his free and unde&s;erved grace and favour towards us. It is thus that the &s;criptures repre&s;ent the matter. "In this was manife&s;ted the love of God to|wards us, becau&s;e that God <HI>&s;ent</HI> his only begot|ten Son into the world, that we might live thro' him." "Chri&s;t who knew no &s;in <HI>was</HI>" by the gracious appointment of God "made &s;in for us," the cha&s;ti&s;ement of our peace was on him, and by <HI>his</HI> &s;tripes we are heal|ed. God was in no way obliged to provide a &s;urety to bear the puni&s;hment of our &s;ins, and di&s;charge our debts for us; neither was he obliged, when a redeemer freely offered him&s;elf to &s;uffer for us, to accept of his &s;uffer|ings as &s;atisfaction for our offences. So that the mi&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t was <HI>of free grace, his</HI> undertaking the office of mediator was <HI>of free grace,</HI> and God's accepting his merits
<PB N="32" REF="012330_0020_0F88C92DAAF5C5B0">
and &s;ufferings for the ju&s;tification of believ|ers, is likewi&s;e of free grace. Hence as the apo&s;tle &s;ays, we are "ju&s;tified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Je&s;us Chri&s;t; whom God hath &s;et forth to be a propitiation, through faith in his blood, to declare his righteou&s;ne&s;s for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins that are pa&s;t, through the forbearance of God:&mdash;That he might be ju&s;t, and the ju&s;tifier of him that believeth in Je&s;us." Rom. 3.24, 25, and 26. So far then is the &s;atis|faction and meritorious &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t from infringing the free grace of God in our ju&s;tification, that it is the greate&s;t in&s;tance of his free and unde&s;erved love towards us. "Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and &s;ent his Son to be the propitiation for our &s;ins." 1 John 4.10.</P>
<P N="2">2. Neither is the free grace of God any ways le&s;&s;ened, by any works of holine&s;s per|formed by men, to qualify them&s;elves for the &s;aving gift. The apo&s;tle Paul is very earne&s;t in affirming and proving that no man can be ju&s;tified by any deeds of his own, done in conformity to the law. If indeed any man had fully an&s;wered the demands of the law, &s;o as to &s;tand ju&s;tified and uncon|demned, when that is made the &s;tandard of judgment, then "the reward would ju&s;tly be reckoned, <HI>not of grace</HI> but <HI>of debt:</HI>" He
<PB N="33" REF="012330_0020_0F88C92DAAF5C5B0">
might claim the reward as his due. But this is not the ca&s;e. There is no one but has tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the law, and &s;o &s;ubjected him|&s;elf to it's cur&s;e. For the law is very &s;trict and peremptory in pronouncing "every one cur&s;ed that continueth not in all things that are written in the book of the law to do them." But as many as are under the law and expect ju&s;tification by it, <HI>are under the cur&s;e.</HI> For, &s;ays the apo&s;tle, "all are gone out of the way&mdash;there is none righteous, no not one." Agreable to which &s;aith the wi&s;e man, "There is not a ju&s;t man upon earth that doeth good and &s;inneth not." Since therefore all mankind have rendred but a very imperfect obedience to the divine law, and con&s;equently are under the cur&s;e of it, they cannot be ju&s;tified by it. For the law cannot condemn a man as a tran&s;gre&s;&s;or, and at the &s;ame time vindicate him as righteous. So that it mu&s;t be by the free grace of God, through the redemption of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that any man is ju&s;tified and &s;aved; &s;ince all that we do merits no reward, but leaves us &s;till debtors to the law. <HI>Not by works of righ|teou&s;ne&s;s that we have done,</HI> &s;aith the apo&s;tle, <HI>but according to his mercy be &s;aved us, by the wa&s;hing of regeneration, and renewing of the holy Gho&s;t; which he &s;hed on us abundantly through Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Saviour; that, be|ing
<PB N="34" REF="012330_0021_0F88C9305A2FA4D0">
ju&s;tified by his grace, we &s;hould be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</HI> Titus 3.5, 6, 7. It would reflect highly o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the divine wi&s;dom in con&s;ulting a redeemer, and would de&s;troy the nece&s;&s;ity of any me|diator, to &s;uppo&s;e that we by any works of ours, could claim the divine acceptance. For "if righteou&s;ne&s;s comes by the law, then Chri&s;t is dead in vain." "Then faith is made void, and the promi&s;e made of none effect." For the promi&s;e of ju&s;tification to tho&s;e that believed in Chri&s;t, and depended on his righ|teou&s;ne&s;s alone herefor, would be vain and u&s;ele&s;s, could we be ju&s;tified by the law, in con&s;equence of any deeds of ours done is conformity to it. But &s;ince it is impo&s;&s;ible that any &s;hould make void the promi&s;es or de&s;igns of God, it is evident, that it is of the free and abundant grace of God alone that any of the &s;inful children of men are ju&s;tified and &s;aved. Indeed it is not only on account of our being debtors to the law, that we an &s;aved by grace, but the &s;ame divine grace would be exerci&s;ed in our &s;alvation were we free from the law. For &s;uppo&s;e a man &s;hould render perfect obedience to the divine law, and not tran&s;gre&s;s it, in one &s;ingle point, yet &s;till he would merit nothing; and hav|ing done no more than his duty, &s;epara<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> from the divine promi&s;e, he would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="35" REF="012330_0021_0F88C9305A2FA4D0">
entitled to no reward. Ju&s;tification indeed be might claim as his due: For he being really righteous, de&s;erves to be e&s;teemed and vindicated as righteous. Wherefore though &s;uch a one could not be looked upon as guilty in the &s;ight of God, and con&s;equently not liable to puni&s;hment; yet &s;eparate from the promi&s;e of God, who has connected ju&s;tifica|tion with &s;alvation, and has &s;aid that "whom he ju&s;tifies, them he al&s;o will glorify," &s;e|parate from this I &s;ay, he would not be en|titled to eternal life in heaven. If then the be&s;towment of eternal happine&s;s on man would be of grace, even if he perfectly an|&s;wered the demands of the law, what &s;uper|abounding grace is exerted in &s;aving any, when "all have &s;inned and come &s;hort of the glory of God?" But I proceed to con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="2">II. The grand qualification requi&s;ite in tho&s;e who &s;hall obtain &s;alvation. By grace are ye &s;aved <HI>thro' faith.</HI>" It is only thro' faith therefore that &s;alvation is obtained. In the ju&s;tification of a per&s;on by which he is put into a &s;tate of &s;alvation, there are three things requi&s;ite, grace, Chri&s;t &amp; faith. The free grace of God is the <HI>prime or im|pul&s;ive cau&s;e</HI> of man's &s;alvation; the righ|teou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t is the &s;ole <HI>meritorious cau&s;e</HI>; and <HI>faith in him,</HI> is the qualification
<PB N="36" REF="012330_0022_0F88C931F137FDA8">
required in tho&s;e that receive this &s;alvation, and is that by which alone the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t is imputed to any for ju&s;tification.</P>
<P>Faith, in the &s;imple notion of it, is an a&s;&s;en, or per&s;ua&s;ion of the mind relating to any truth upon the te&s;timony of others. The object of chri&s;tian faith is the revealed word of God, e&s;pecially the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles. It is, as the apo&s;tle phra&s;es it, "the belief of the truth as it is in Je&s;us." But all that believe Chri&s;t and his go&s;pel, are not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;aving faith. When our Saviour preached to the Jews at Bethany, "many of the chief rulers believed on him:" But they &s;till remained in a &s;tate of condem|nation, and <HI>loved the prai&s;e of men more than the prai&s;e of God.</HI> John 12.43. And &s;uch is the faith of many profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tians at this day. It is hi&s;torical &amp; &s;peculative only; it is the re&s;ult of education, rather than a &s;e|rious and pious confidence in the te&s;timony of God, and does but faintly affect their hearts, and influence their actions. It may rather be &s;aid of them, that they do not di&s;|believe the go&s;pel, or do not concern them|&s;elves about it, whether it be true or not, than that they have a po&s;itive belief of it, or a firm per&s;ua&s;ion of the truth of tho&s;e im|portant matters contained in it. But he who is the &s;ubject of &s;aving faith, hath a realizing
<PB N="37" REF="012330_0022_0F88C931F137FDA8">
and affecting view of &s;piritual things. He receives the truths of the go&s;pel, "not as the word of man but as the word of God," and relies on Chri&s;t alone for &s;alvation. The eyes of his under&s;tanding being enlightned, he is enabled to view divine truths in their &s;pirituality and importance, as what intimate|ly concern him, and ought &s;uitably to affect him. The natural product of this faith is love to God, and delight in his wor&s;hip and obedience. It is a faith that <HI>works by love, and purifies the heart.</HI> It is a faith that <HI>o|vercometh the world</HI>; &s;o as that the &s;ubject of it is not <HI>conformed unto this evil world,</HI> but is <HI>transformed by the renewing of the holy Gho&s;t,</HI> and <HI>created anew in Chri&s;t Je&s;us unto good works.</HI> For <HI>who&s;oever believeth that Je&s;us is the Chri&s;t,</HI> &s;ays the apo&s;tle John, <HI>is born of God:</HI> And <HI>who&s;oever is born of God &s;inneth not,</HI> does not allow him&s;elf in known tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, but <HI>keepeth him&s;elf,</HI> and is careful to conform his conver&s;ation to the example of Chri&s;t, and the precepts of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>Thus the true chri&s;tian faith, or that faith which ju&s;tifies and &s;aves, is &s;uch a firm and realizing per&s;ua&s;ion of the truth of the go&s;|pel, as powerfully influences the heart and affections, and di&s;po&s;es to a chearful compli|ance with all the divine commands. Such
<PB N="38" REF="012330_0023_0F88C9325AFB2290">
was the faith of <HI>Abraham, the father of the faithful,</HI> who "by faith, when he was called to go out unto a place which he &s;hould after|wards receive for an inheritance, <HI>obeyed.</HI>" And &s;uch was the faith of all the ancient Patriarchs, as the apo&s;tle to the Hebrews &s;hews at large;&mdash;and this is the faith which the apo&s;tle James &s;hews to be nece&s;&s;ary to our ju&s;tification. We are not ju&s;tified by a <HI>dead</HI> and unactive faith, but by &s;uch a faith as is a lively and powerful principle of holy actions, as exerts and evidences it&s;elf by good works, as is declared in the 2d chapter of St. James's epi&s;tle. St. Paul likewi&s;e a&s;&s;ures us, that <HI>all,</HI> whatever their belief is, "who obey not the go&s;pel of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, &s;hall be puni&s;hed with everla&s;ting de&s;truction from the pre&s;ence of the Lord, and the glory of his power." 2 The&s;&s;. 1.9. Works of obe|dience then, or the ble&s;&s;ed fruits of faith, are the be&s;t and only &s;ure evidence by which <HI>the faith of God's elect,</HI> may be di&s;cerned from the faith of &s;uch as remain in an unju&s;tified &s;tate. And that <HI>faith</HI> in this view of it, is the con|dition on which the &s;aving benefits of Chri&s;t's mediation are conferred upon us, or the qua|lification required in order to our being ju&s;ti|fied before God, and admitted to eternal life, is evident from &s;cripture, and from the na|ture of the thing. John 3.36. <HI>He that
<PB N="39" REF="012330_0023_0F88C9325AFB2290">
believeth on the Son hath everla&s;ting life; but he that believeth not the Son, &s;hall not &s;ee life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.</HI> In the Greek it is, "he that <HI>obeyeth</HI> not the Son," without which none does truly and &s;avingly believe. It is nece&s;&s;ary that mens hearts &s;hould be <HI>purified by faith,</HI> be|fore they can be fitted for the holy enjoyments of heaven. By faith they realize things not &s;een, conquer the world in their affections, and look &s;upremely at God and heaven:&mdash; It is <HI>through faith</HI> then that any <HI>are &s;aved.</HI> But here le&s;t we mi&s;take, it is nece&s;&s;ary that we make a proper di&s;tinction. Though <HI>be|lievers</HI> only are ju&s;tified and &s;aved; yet their believing is not the meritorious cau&s;e of their &s;alvation. It is not for the &s;ake of any thing that the per&s;on is or has, that he is acquitted from guilt, and admitted into favour and happine&s;s with God: But the reward pro|ceeds wholly from the free grace of God, and is conferred &s;olely on account, or in con&s;ideration of the righteou&s;ne&s;s wrought out by Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Faith is to be under|&s;tood as &s;ubordinate to the&s;e. For if we rely on our faith as that in the &s;ole virtue of which we &s;hall be ju&s;tified and &s;aved, or as the con|&s;ideration entitling us to the&s;e, we do as truly make void the grace of God, and the death of Chri&s;t, as if we relied on the merit of our
<PB N="40" REF="012330_0024_0F88C932F4066BA0">
works to &s;ave us. Unerring wi&s;dom has &s;een fit to con&s;titute his plan of mercy, as that the &s;aving benefits of redemption &s;hould be conferred only on &s;uch as believe on him; not becau&s;e their faith has any merit or ten|dency in it&s;elf to procure the&s;e benefits; but becau&s;e it is mo&s;t &s;uitable to the honor of his maje&s;ty, to confer them on &s;uch as believe on, and tru&s;t in, the proffer'd Saviour, rather than on &s;uch as de&s;pi&s;e and reject him. "Without faith it is impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e God." "Believe on the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t and thou &s;halt be &s;aved." I proceed now to con&s;ider the</P>
<P>IIId and la&s;t thing propo&s;ed from the text, viz. To &s;hew how, or in what &s;en&s;e this faith is &s;aid truly and properly to be the <HI>gift of God.</HI> But here by the way, I would ju&s;t re|mark, that this la&s;t part of the text is ex|pre&s;&s;ed &s;omewhat ambiguou&s;ly (as well in the original as in our tran&s;lation) and accor|dingly expo&s;itors differ in their interpretation of it. Some [as Poole, Clarius, &amp;c.] refer the la&s;t words, "it is the gift of God," to the whole preceeding &s;entence: "By grace ye are &s;av|ed," &amp;c.&mdash;and &s;o under&s;tand it, that &s;alva|tion is the gift of God.&mdash;Others again [as Henry, Grotius, Burkitt, &amp;c.] refer it to the &s;ub&s;tantive immediately foregoing, and &s;up|po&s;e that what the apo&s;tle de&s;igned to affirm,
<PB N="41" REF="012330_0024_0F88C932F4066BA0">
was, that the faith through which we are &s;aved, <HI>is the gift of God.</HI> I &s;hall prefer the latter &s;en&s;e as it is the common acceptation, and as it is agreable to what this &s;ame apo|&s;tle, who is the be&s;t interpreter of his own meaning, &s;ays in another place, Phil. 1.29. "Unto you it is <HI>given,</HI> to <HI>believe</HI> on him." So that what I have to enquire into is, how this <HI>faith</HI> by which we are ju&s;tified and &s;av|ed, is <HI>the gift of God</HI>; or in what &s;en&s;e it is properly &s;aid to be the gift of God? To this I an&s;wer&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. Negatively. Faith is not &s;o the gift of God, as to prevent or &s;et a&s;ide the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of all endeavours of our own to obtain it. It is very plain from the whole tenor of &s;cripture, from the exhortations, commands, promi&s;es and threatnings, which are found in almo&s;t every page, e&s;pecially of the new Te&s;tament. It is very evident from the&s;e, I &s;ay, and will appear &s;o to every one, that peru&s;es them, with a careful and impartial eye, that we are not to &s;it idle and indulge our&s;elves in &s;in, 'till God &s;hall &s;ee fit to in|&s;pire us with this &s;aving virtue; but that we are to be up and doing, exercing our&s;elves and faculties in the u&s;e of tho&s;e means, which God has appointed to fit us, for the be&s;tow|ment of his grace and &s;pirit, and by which alone he <HI>ordinarily</HI> communicates them.&mdash;
<PB N="42" REF="012330_0025_0F88C933AA556ED0">
Why el&s;e are we &s;o often called upon to be|lieve, repent, &amp;c. and threatned with aggra|vated damnation if we comply not? Why does he not rather &s;ay to us, as to the I&s;ra|elites at the red, &s;ea, "<HI>Stand &s;till,</HI> &amp; &s;ee the &s;al|vation of the Lord?" This were more pro|per and &s;uitable language to be addre&s;&s;ed to us, if there is nothing for us to do preparatory to, or in concurrence with, the &s;aving work of the Spirit in our &s;ouls, than that which we find in the new Te&s;tament, "Repent and believe the go&s;pel&mdash;and he that believeth not &s;hall be damned&mdash;He that hath ears to hear, let him <HI>hear</HI>&mdash;Con&s;ider the mighty works and miracles wrought among you, &amp; be per|&s;uaded by them to believe on me, otherwi&s;e it &s;hall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon, for Sodom and Gomorrha, in the day of judg|ment, than for you&mdash;&s;trive to enter into the &s;trait gate;" and innumerable other texts of like import.

Now if God in the be&s;towment of faith &s;uper&s;edes all human exertions, why does Chri&s;t mention it as a work required of them?

God as moral and accountable agents, as beings endued with under&s;tanding and will; and God requires that we make u&s;e of our rational faculties in matters of religion and faith. Otherwi&s;e what need have we of any written revelation at all, if the belief of di|vine truths is wrought in us wholly by the more compendious way of divine illumina|tion?

If we are not to apply our diligence to reading and hearing the word, and to weigh in our minds the proofs offered for our rational convicti|on, the multitude of miracles wrought by Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles, were to no end, and the works them&s;elves, as well as the records of them, are wholly &s;uperfluous.

<P N="1">1. It is God that gave the <HI>object of faith,</HI> viz. Chri&s;t and his go&s;pel.

<P>All this was done without any concur|rence, &s;ollicitation or endeavours, on the part of man. As God therefore gave Chri&s;t, and his go&s;pel, to be believed by man, he may truly and ju&s;tly be &s;aid, to be the giver of the chri&s;tian faith.</P>
<P N="2">2. God is the giver of faith, as he is the author of tho&s;e arguments which were de|&s;igned to convince and per&s;uade the natural rea&s;on of men. God not only &s;ent his Son to publi&s;h the glad tidings of &s;alvation, but he al&s;o accompanied his mi&s;&s;ion, with &s;uch

glorious proofs and atte&s;tations as render all men inexcu&s;able who do not believe on him. Thus, by a voice from heaven, the man&s;ion of his glory, he declared him to be his "beloved Son in whom he was well plea&s;ed." The Saviour through the whole cour&s;e of his mini&s;try, wrought by his divine power many great, &s;ignal and evident mira|cles, to confirm the faith of his di&s;ciples, and that all men might have &s;ufficient evidence to believe on him: And to the&s;e he him&s;elf frequently appeals for the truth of his divine mi&s;&s;ion. And after his a&s;cen&s;ion his apo&s;tles were enabled, by the effu&s;ion of the holy Spirit on them, to work miracles in his name, for the conviction of the world: "God him|&s;elf bearing witne&s;s to the truth of their preaching, both with &s;igns and wonders, and divers miracles, and gifts of the holy Gho&s;t." But the greate&s;t outward te&s;timony, which the Spirit of God has given of the truth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Chri&s;t's mi&s;&s;ion, is, <HI>his re&s;urrection from the dead.</HI> By this "he was declared to be the Son of God with power." St. Paul, in his &s;ermon at Athens, having mentioned the im|portant article of a future judgment by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, gives this as the confirmation of it, "whereof he hath <HI>given a&s;&s;urance</HI> unto all men, in that he hath <HI>rai&s;ed him from the dead.</HI>" In the original it is, "given <HI>faith</HI>

<P N="3">3dly and la&s;tly. Faith is the gift of God, more e&s;pecially in re&s;pect to the <HI>Spirit of God,</HI> by which this faith is produced in the heart, and without the inward efficacy and operation of which, it never becomes an a|biding and effectual per&s;ua&s;ion and principle of holine&s;s in any per&s;on. It is the <HI>Spirit of God</HI> that worketh in us the <HI>work of faith with power</HI>; and not the mere exertion of our natural faculties, which being depraved and di&s;abled by &s;in, are in&s;ufficient for this work. But then the method ordinarily made u&s;e of by the &s;pirit of holine&s;s in working faith in the hearts of men, is not immediate in&s;piration, or a mere &s;upernatural and irre|&s;i&s;tible impul&s;e, in which man is wholly and entirely pa&s;&s;ive; but a proper improving and directing the&s;e faculties we already po&s;|&s;e&s;s, concurring with them, and propounding proper means and motives to them. The &s;pirit does not implant in our minds any new faculties or powers which we had not before, neither does it infu&s;e into them any new truths, be&s;ides them contained in the holy Bible, which is a perfect rule of faith and manners. But by the Spirit of God ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

under&s;tandings are &s;trengthned, &amp; the truths of the go&s;pel propo&s;ed to them in a new and &s;triking light. "The eyes of our under|&s;tandings being enlightned, that we may know what is the hope of his calling," &amp;c.

<P>It is by &s;uch means as the&s;e, generally, that the Spirit of holine&s;s works faith in the hearts of men, and not by &s;uch an irre&s;i&s;tible im|pul&s;e as &s;upercedes the u&s;e of our own facul|ties and endeavours.

<P>Some will think thus. The evidence of &s;en&s;e is certainly a &s;tronger degree of a&s;&s;u|rance and more &s;olid ground of a&s;&s;ent, than the evidence of faith.

<HEAD>APPLICATION.</HEAD>
<P>From what has been &s;aid we &s;ee the rea&s;on why &s;en&s;ual and worldly men are &s;o blind and aver&s;e to the future concerns of their &s;ouls. It is becau&s;e the&s;e things are matters of faith, and not objects of &s;ight; and their minds are &s;o &s;en&s;ualized, as not to reli&s;h any thing of a &s;piritual nature, nor pur&s;ue any thing that does not affect their &s;en&s;es. The world and the things of it have engro&s;&s;ed the whole of their affections and thoughts; and whil&s;t the&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;overeignty of the &s;oul, they exclude from it all de&s;ires and contemplati|ons of a &s;erious &amp; heavenly nature. There|fore, &s;ays the apo&s;tle, "Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world; for if any man love the world, the love of the father is not in him." The carnal man walks only by &s;ight, and knows not how to direct his cour&s;e by faith of things not &s;een. The concerns of a future &s;tate appear at a great di&s;tance, to him that is u&s;ed to contemplate only on pre&s;ent things; at &s;o great a di&s;tance that he believes them not, or which amounts to the &s;ame thing, regards them not. Thus "the carnal mind" (or, as the apo&s;tle ex|pre&s;&s;es it in another place, "the friend&s;hip of the world) is enmity with God." We ought therefore to "take diligent heed le&s;t there be in any of us an evil heart of unbe|lief,
<PB N="74" REF="012330_0041_0F88C944FA837A18">
in departing from the living God." Though we &s;ee not now either the <HI>glories</HI> or the <HI>horrors</HI> of the invi&s;ible world; yet &s;ince God that cannot lie, has promi&s;ed the o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and threatned the other, and &s;ince we know that he <HI>is not &s;lack concerning his promi&s;es,</HI> w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> are no le&s;s certain of them, and ought no le&s;s to by influenced by them, than if we &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> them.

<P>Hence al&s;o we &s;ee the unrea&s;onablene&s;s of all &s;uch as di&s;believe the things of God and another world, becau&s;e they have not &s;een them. For it is impo&s;&s;ible in the nature of the thing that they &s;hould &s;ee the&s;e things whil&s;t they dwell in bodies of fle&s;h. Spirit and &s;piritual things being of too &s;ubtile and refined a nature to be di&s;cerned by our gro&s;s corporeal organs. Be&s;ides if they could be made to &s;ee them, &s;till it would be to no end. God having already done enough to convince the rea&s;on of every intelligent man who at|tends to the thing without prejudice. For if a man ob&s;tinately &s;tands out again&s;t all the arguments &amp; means of conviction which God has given, if he refu&s;es to hear Mo&s;es and the Prophets, Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles; if he will not hearken to the dictates of his own mind,
<PB N="75" REF="012330_0041_0F88C944FA837A18">
nor the &s;ugge&s;tions of the holy Spirit; we have the rea&s;on of the thing, as well as the word of God to a&s;&s;ure us, that he would not <HI>truely</HI> and <HI>stedfa&s;tly</HI> believe, tho' one of the ble&s;&s;ed inhabitants of Heaven &s;hould be deputed to declare to him in the language of glory, the being and will of God; or the one &s;hould ari&s;e from the dead, array|ed in all the gha&s;tly terrors of the pit, &s;hould proclaim the dreadful condemnation of ob|&s;tinate unbelievers. He would doubtle&s;s be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">artled and convinced for the time; but while the &s;ame prejudices and lu&s;ts were &s;uffered to predominate, which hindred his belief before, he would not &s;incerely and &s;avingly believe, &s;o as to direct his walk by faith and not by &s;ight.</P>
<P>We &s;ee likewi&s;e the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of God, who has given &s;ufficient evidence of religious truths, for the &s;atisfaction of e|very one who is not prepo&s;&s;e&s;t, and bias'd by his pa&s;&s;ions and lu&s;ts; and has moreover promi&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t and conduct &s;uch in their &s;earch after truth. God has not thought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">it &s;o far to humour the infidelity of men as to give them a &s;ight of future things, &s;ince this would have no good effect to pro|cure a &s;aving faith, or to draw men to obe|dience by the generous motives of love &amp; gra|titude, but only to produce a con&s;trained

<P>Moreover, we learn from what has be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> di&s;cour&s;ed on this &s;ubject, that faith is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> militant virtue, which has no place in heaven<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> On earth chri&s;tians walk by faith, and not by &s;ight: But in heaven their faith &s;hall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;wallowed up in perfect vi&s;ion.

<P>Again, we learn the nece&s;&s;ity of our exer|ci&s;ing faith in things not &s;een. This is the very foundation of all religion. "Without faith it is impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e God: For he

<P>But if our faith be e&s;tabli&s;hed on &s;uch dear and undeniable evidence, as &s;hall give full &s;atisfaction to our minds, it will render invi&s;ible objects as real and evident, as &s;en&s;e does vi&s;ible ones.

<P>_THE chri&s;tian religion is partly &s;peculative, and partly practical. In the go&s;pel which contains this religion, are conveyed the clear|e&s;t in&s;tructions, and mo&s;t important doct|rines, which &s;erve not only to gratify the inqui&s;itive mind, but to edify the chri&s;tian, and direct the immortal &s;oul.

over us, and all things. In the word of God are di&s;covered to us our primitive, our pre&s;ent, and our future &s;tate. Here we learn, that man was created in the ima<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of God, perfect and upright, but that h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;oon broke the divine command which wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the te&s;t of his obedience, and the conformity to which, was the condition of his remaining in his happy paradi&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cal &s;tate: That by this breach of the divine law, he lo&s;t the di|vine image, forfeited God's favour, and ex|po&s;ed him&s;elf to his eternal di&s;plea&s;ure. But in&s;tead of our being doomed to &s;uffer irretrievably that eternal death which is an|nexed to the breach of God's law, the go&s;|pel brings us glad tidings of great joy. By this we are informed that God of his infinite mercy, and uncon&s;trained goodne&s;s, has deigned to &s;end his own &s;on, from the glo|rious man&s;ions of bli&s;s, where he &s;hone coe|ternal with the father, to this our polluted world, to ran&s;om us from &s;in and de&s;tructi|on, to bear the puni&s;hment of our &s;ins, and thereby render man's &s;alvation con&s;i&s;tent with God's unerring ju&s;tice. In the go&s;pel revelation, the plan of grace, the method of executing it, the benefits re&s;ulting therefrom, and the terms on which we are to receive them are laid before us, and propo&s;ed to our &s;tudy and acquaintance. Here it is that we are to
<PB N="85" REF="012330_0046_0F88C94A45A9F380">
learn our duty. Here are laid down the mo&s;t excellent rules &amp; mo&s;t important precepts for the direction of our conduct. And it is our incumbent and indi&s;pen&s;able duty to &s;tudy the&s;e rules, and by a diligent inquiry, to in|form our&s;elves in whatever our great Creator, Lawgiver and Redeemer, requires of us. But we are not to re&s;t here. We are not only to &s;earch out what our duty is, but mu&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly and diligently &s;et about the practice of it. Knowledge is ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite in order to practice, but in vain and u&s;ele&s;s with|out it. <HI>U&s;ele&s;s</HI> did I &s;ay? Nay, it is an ag|gravation of our guilt; for "he that knows his ma&s;ter's will, and yet doth it not, &s;hall be beaten with many &s;tripes." One de&s;ign of our Saviour's appearing on earth, was to in&s;truct men in the doctrines and duties of religion; for without &s;uch in&s;truction they could not partake of the benefits of his re|demption. This in&s;truction he gave both by example &amp; precept. But he often inculcates it upon us, that we re&s;t not in the bare &s;pe|culative knowledge of our duty, but that we be careful to reduce it to practice. "Learn of me," &s;ays he, and not only &s;o, but "if ye love me keep my commandments."</P>
<P>And here, in the text, he promi&s;es the re|ward of happine&s;s to tho&s;e that not only <HI>know,</HI> but <HI>do</HI> what is commanded them.
<PB N="86" REF="012330_0047_0F88C94B149F05B0">
"If ye know the&s;e things, &amp;c." In this our Saviour takes occa&s;ion from a particular in&s;tance, to &s;ettle a general maxim, viz that religion con&s;i&s;ts mainly in <HI>practice,</HI> to which, neverthele&s;s, knowledge is a pre-requi&s;ite. In the preceeding ver&s;es we are told, that Chri&s;t though Lord of glory, conde&s;cended to the low and &s;ervile office of <HI>wa&s;hing his di&s;ciples feet,</HI> thereby to te&s;tify his love to his di&s;ciples, to give them an example of humi|lity and &s;erviceablene&s;s, and to figure to them that &s;piritual wa&s;hing which was nece&s;&s;ary in order to their being clean&s;ed from the filth, and pollution of &s;in, and being made parta|kers of his holine&s;s.

from a de&s;ign to glorify him, we do not do our duty, even whil&s;t we perform tho&s;e ve|ry acts, which are required of us by God as duties.

For "without holine&s;s no man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord." Nay &s;o far will the bare knowledge of God's requirements be from benefiting us, that it will make us the more aggravatedly guilty, and con&s;equently more deplorably mi&s;erable. He that conforms not to an unknown law, has &s;ome excu&s;e for his neglect; but if we &s;in again&s;t the light we have no cloak for our &s;in. "To him that knoweth to do good, and doth it not, to him it is &s;in." James 4.17.

<P N="1">1. They are happy in the favor &amp; ble&s;&s;ing of God here on earth. This the apo&s;tle James declares, "Be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your&s;elves.

Such &s;hall be ble&s;&s;ed with the enjoyment of worldly good things, &s;o far as God &s;ees to be mo&s;t for his glory, and be&s;t for them. "The Lord will give grace and glory, and no good thing will he withhold from them." A confluence of earthly enjoyments often|times proves a &s;nare to men; wherefore God often &s;ees it be&s;t that his faithful &s;er|vants

But even if they are de&s;titute of the&s;e, and over|whelm'd in afflictions, &s;till God is merciful to them, extends his grace and favour to|wards them, &s;anctifies his afflictive di&s;pen|&s;ations to them, and &s;o makes all things work together for their good. Tho&s;e that &s;incerely endeavour, to conform their minds and actions to the will of God, enjoy his fa|vor and &s;miles here on earth; whereas they that know their duty, and are not careful to do it, are objects of his wrath and di&s;plea&s;ure. "For not the hearers of the law are ju&s;t before God, but the <HI>doers</HI> of the law &s;hall be ju&s;tified." Rom. 2.13.

Where|as on the contrary, nothing &s;o troubles and di&s;quiets a man's mind, as the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that what he is doing is di&s;plea&s;ing to God, and &s;o a violation of his duty to him. Our actions con&s;idered only in them&s;elves, and in relation to this life, nece&s;&s;arily afford either &s;atisfaction or di&s;&s;atisfaction, according as they are conformable to the will of God or not. But more e&s;pecially do they &s;o, if we take into con&s;ideration tho&s;e future rewards and puni&s;hments, which are the certain con|&s;equents of them. The&s;e hopes of the di|vine approbation and reward hereafter, which men enjoy upon doing their duty; and that dread of future vengeance which attends the neglect and violation of it, greatly increa&s;e the &s;erenity and joy of the active &s;ervants of Chri&s;t, and the grief and unea&s;ine&s;s of the vain profe&s;&s;ors of his go&s;pel.

<P N="3">3. Such as not only know, but <HI>do</HI> the will of God, will be happy in the eternal enjoy|ment of him. We are told by the in&s;pired P&s;almi&s;t, P&s;al. 103.18. "The mercy of the Lord is <HI>from everla&s;ting to everla&s;ting</HI> upon them that fear him; to &s;uch as keep his covenant, and to tho&s;e that <HI>remember</HI> his commandments to <HI>do</HI> them." Not to &s;uch as barely <HI>remember</HI> his commandments, but to &s;uch as <HI>remember</HI> them <HI>to do them.</HI> This is the account which the bible gives us of the matter, from one end of it to the other. "If thou do&s;t well, &s;halt thou not be accept|ed?" &s;ays God to Cain. And in the la&s;t chapter of the revelations Chri&s;t &s;ays, "Be|hold I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give to every man according as his work &s;hall be.&mdash;Ble&s;&s;ed are they that <HI>do</HI> his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city." If a man attend to the doctrine of Chri&s;t, and gain the knowledge of it, without governing his life by it, his hopes of heaven are vain and groundle&s;s, built as it were upon the &s;and. The difference of the hopes of him that per|forms his duty, and of him that negligently hears it, is thus admirably expre&s;&s;ed by our

That they are not prohibited the lowe&s;t of the people, nor lock'd up from them in an unknown tongue, as in &s;ome popi&s;h coun|tries, but that we have been taught from our infancy to read, and to &s;tudy them, and to hear the explanations of them. How thank|ful ought we to be for &s;abbath opportuni|ties? For the provi&s;ion God has made in his church of a &s;tanding mini&s;try, whereby the truths of the go&s;pel are propo&s;ed, and his precepts inculcated on our minds; wherein by his amba&s;&s;adors, Chri&s;t him&s;elf be&s;eeches us to be reconciled to God, and calls upon us to repent, turn, and live. What prai&s;es and thank&s;givings &s;hould we render to God, for the &s;pirit of grace, whereby if we &s;in|cerely a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m at doing our duty, our minds will be enlightened in the knowledge of Chri&s;t, and we <HI>led</HI> into all truth. For, &s;aith Chri&s;t, "if any man be de&s;irous to do his will, he &s;hall know of the doctrine whether it be of God, or whe|ther
<PB N="103" REF="012330_0055_0F88C8F4AB0F7BB8">
I &s;peak of my&s;elf." Whereas "if the go&s;pel be hid from any, it is hid to them that are lo&s;t; in whom the god of this world hath b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">inded the minds of them that believe not, le&s;t the light of the glorious go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, &s;hould &s;hine unto them." So that if any man &s;earches the &s;criptures with an hone&s;t heart, and with &s;incere de&s;ires to learn and do the will of God, God will graciou&s;ly a&s;&s;i&s;t him, and by the illuminations of his &s;pi|rit, lead him into the knowledge of all ne|ce&s;&s;ary truth. "The meek will he guide in judgment; and the meek will he teach his way." The goodne&s;s of God in this re&s;pect calls for our &s;incere and unfeigned thanks.</P>
<P N="2">2. How inexcu&s;eable &s;hall we be if we do not improve tho&s;e means of knowledge, in &s;tudy and in practice? The heathen, who were never favoured with the light of reve|lation as we are, will by a plea of ignorance, receive at lea&s;t a mitigation of their puni&s;h|ment. But <HI>we</HI> cannot exculpate our&s;elves by pleading ignorance at the ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of God. For &s;ince God has put us into a capacity of learning our duty; though we &s;hould neg|lect the means of knowledge, and remain as ignorant of the divine will as the heathen world, yet our ignorance would not &s;erve for our excu&s;e, at the great day. For God

offers in&s;truction to us if we will receive it, but we wilfully oppo&s;e it. And the breach of duties of which we are <HI>wilfully</HI> ignorant, is equally as blame-worthy as the breach of, duties which we knew to be commanded by God. Wherefore when I &s;ay that the know|ledge of duties unperformed, will aggravate our puni&s;hment, let none think to alleviate his condemnation by ob&s;tinately per&s;i&s;ting in ignorance of his duty. For the ob&s;tinate neglect of learning his duty, will render him as guilty in the &s;ight of God, and con&s;e|quently as mi&s;erable, as the not performing his duty when known. Wherefore we &s;ee how de&s;titute we are of all excu&s;e, if we do not make u&s;e of tho&s;e means which God has graciou&s;ly favoured us with, and by divine grace, learn and practice what is required of us. God has done his part towards in&s;truct|ing us. He has granted us his word, and offers us his &s;pirit, to enlighten our under|&s;tandings, and lead us in the way of truth. Whom then have we to blame but our&s;elves, if we at la&s;t &s;uffer the aggravated condem|nation of tho&s;e who have <HI>cho&s;en darkne&s;s ra|ther than light, becau&s;e their deeds were e|vil?</HI> Since then we cannot be acquitted up|on a plea of ignorance, for our own non-con|formity to the divine will; what excu&s;e &s;hall we offer?

and inability to perform the duties re|quired of us? Neither will this pretence &s;tand us in &s;tead. For tho' our natural im|becility and impotence is great, yet God has promi&s;ed us his &s;pirit to help our infir|mities, if we &s;incerely a&s;k it of him, and are de&s;irous to practi&s;e his will. If to our &s;incere endeavours we add our earne&s;t pray|ers for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, his &s;trength will be &s;uffi|cient for us; and through his &s;trengthning <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s we can do all things. "Does any man lack wi&s;dom" to direct, or &s;trength to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in the way of his duty, "Let him a&s;k it of God, who gives to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it &s;hall be given him." <HI>But,</HI> it follows, "let him a&s;k in faith, nothing wavering." Our Savior declares that God is more ready to grant his holy Spirit to tho&s;e that thus a&s;k, than earthly parents are to give portions to their children. So that neither the plea of <HI>igno|rance</HI> nor <HI>inability</HI> will &s;erve to excu&s;e us at the bar of God, for our neglecting the du|ties of religion. But if from principles of love to God and faith in Chri&s;t, we &s;incere|ly and cheerfully endeavour, to perform whatever we can find to be our duty, our obedience tho' mix'd with many imperfec|ions, will through the merits of Chri&s;t be ac|cepted and rewarded. And this is the only

way wherein we can be acquitted, in the day of the revelation of the righteous judgment of God, when he &s;hall render to every man according to his works, and according to the fruit of his doings.</P>
<P>Finally, &s;ince we here &s;ee the road to hap|pine&s;s marked out to us, let us all be per|&s;uaded to pur&s;ue it. Let us lay a&s;ide e|very weight, and the &s;in that does mo&s;t ea&s;ily be&s;et us, and run with patience the race &s;et before us.

Let no difficulties di&s;|courage us, no dangers affright us from per|forming our duty; if we are the di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t, we mu&s;t imitate him as in other things, &s;o in bearing the cro&s;s. "Who&s;oever will come after me, let him deny him&s;elf," &amp;c. We mu&s;t expect to meet with many cro&s;&s;es, difficulties, and di&s;appointments in our chri&s;tian warfare. But con&s;idering the end of our faith, the prize of victory, and him under who&s;e banner we &s;erve, let us cloath our&s;elves with the whole armour of God, and with undaunted fortitude fight the good fight of faith, looking unto Je&s;us the captain of our &s;alvation, who him&s;elf for the joy that was &s;et before him, endured the cro&s;s, de&s;pi&s;ing the &s;hame, and is now

<P>_THESE words are part of St. Paul's famous &s;ermon at Athens, when bro't to an&s;wer for him&s;elf before the court of Areopagus. Athens was at this time famed throughout the world for learning and arts, which flou|ri&s;hed here in the greate&s;t perfection and lu&s;tre, and which rendred this city the mi&s;|tre&s;s
<PB N="110" REF="012330_0059_0F88C8F92B114C90">
of Greece and of the world, and the re|&s;ort of all learned men for &s;everal ages, 'till Rome rivalled her and eclip&s;ed her glory. But however eminent the Athenians were for human knowledge, the holy apo&s;tle found the city wholly given to idolatry, which &s;hewed their gro&s;s ignorance in divine and heavenly things. To reclaim them from their idols to the &s;ervice of the living God, in the de&s;ign and tendency of this di&s;cour&s;e of the apo&s;tle, which we find in the text and context. From the 18th ver&s;e we learn that the apo&s;tle had been di&s;puting with &s;ome of their philo&s;ophers and wi&s;e men, particularly of the epicurean and &s;toic &s;ects. The for|mer of whom, though they did not deny a God, yet they made him an idle and u&s;ele&s;s being, for they held the world to be made and governed by chance, that God took no cognizance of the affairs of men, and that the plea&s;ures of the world con&s;tituted the &s;upreme happine&s;s of man. Thus their prin|ciples tended directly to the di&s;honour of God, and the uncontroled indulgence of all manner of vice and immorality. The latter &s;ect, the &s;toics, allowed both the being and providence of God, but &s;uppo&s;ed him to be of a corporeal &s;ub&s;tance, and that his hands were tied up by the rigid &amp; inflexible laws of fate: And their fancied wi&s;e men, who had
<PB N="111" REF="012330_0059_0F88C8F92B114C90">
wholly eradicated their pa&s;&s;ions, they pro|phanely extolled as equal to God him&s;elf. The&s;e men it was that oppo&s;ed Paul with their fal&s;e notions and &s;ophi&s;tic rea&s;onings, and carried him before the above-named <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ourt, there demanding his farther explana|tion. This was probably done from an itch|ing curio&s;ity of hearing &s;ome new notions or opinions; for it is &s;aid ver. 21. that "all the Athenians and &s;trangers which were there, &s;pent their time in nothing el&s;e, but either to tell or to hear &s;ome new things." The&s;e be|ing a pagan and idolatrous people, and con|&s;equently not knowing the holy &s;criptures, the apo&s;tle does not rea&s;on with them from the &s;criptures as he did oftentimes with the Jews, but confutes their ab&s;urd and idola|trous notions from their own principles, from the rea&s;on and nature of things. But fir&s;t to obviate a prejudice they had conceived a|gain&s;t him as a letter-forth of &s;trange gods, he tells them that the God he preached unto them they already ignorantly wor&s;hipped, as appeared by an altar they had among&s;t them in&s;cribed "to the unknown God." That his de&s;ign therefore was only to in&s;truct them in his nature and perfections, and the way to render their conduct acceptable to him. Tho&s;e things he proves and elucidates from God's making the world, and pre&s;erving all
<PB N="112" REF="012330_0060_0F88C8F9ECBB33D0">
things in being, &s;o that "in him we live, move, and have our being." And he cites [a pa&s;&s;age from <HI>Aratus</HI>] one of their own poets, affirming that we are all the offspring of God. Since then God is allowed to be the God of the &s;pirits of all fle&s;h, and &s;ince he giveth to all life and breath and all things, the apo&s;tle infers that he cannot be like to gold or &s;ilver, or &s;tone graven by the art of man, nor that he dwells in temples made with hands, or that he was wor&s;hipped by their oblations as though be needed any thing, or was fed by the fumes of their in|cen&s;e and &s;acrifices, as they ab&s;urdly and fondly imagined. And le&s;t they &s;hould plead the authority of their own religion, and their de&s;ires of tru&s;ting their &s;alva|tion on the &s;ame footing that their fathers for &s;o many ages had, the apo&s;tle tells them in the text, that though God had hitherto connived at their ignorant &s;y&s;tems of devo|tion and ways of wor&s;hip, yet that he had now revealed a new di&s;pen&s;ation of his grace, wherein he aboli&s;hed all &s;acrifices but that of Chri&s;t, who had now appeared in the end of the world to take away &s;in by one &s;acri|fice of him&s;elf; and wherein all men were invited to <HI>repent</HI> of all their former &s;ins and mi&s;carriages, and accept the &s;alvation offered by Je&s;us Chri&s;t. And the times of this ig|norance

God winked at, &amp;c. Becau&s;e he hath appointed a day, &amp;c.

Accordingly, though many re&s;i&s;ted the evi|dence &amp; &s;pirit with which the apo&s;tle &s;pake, there were many likewi&s;e, as we learn from the &s;ub&s;equent narration, that were convin|ced hereby, and converted to the chri&s;tian <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aith; one of which belonged to the council before which St. Paul was &s;ummoned.</P>

tho&s;e places, where human literature was in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">'s highe&s;t perfection; if we look into the doctrines and practices of the mo&s;t enlight|ened men among them, we &s;hall find that di|vine and &s;piritual knowledge was at a very low ebb. "They were vain in their imagi|nations, &amp; their fooli&s;h hearts was darkned." The generality of them form'd very gro&s;s conceptions, and laboured under very perni|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ous mi&s;takes concerning God; which be|ing the foundation of all religion, the whole &s;uper&s;tructure mu&s;t likewi&s;e be very faulty and erroneous. How did they people hea|ven &amp; earth with a multitude of deities, and pay their &s;en&s;ele&s;s adorations and offer &s;acri|fices to gods of their own creation; though few of them went &s;o far as wholly to deny the exi&s;tence of any God, (for to do this they mu&s;t fir&s;t deny their rea&s;on and &s;en&s;es, &s;ince they could not open their eyes without di&s;|covering the foot&s;teps of the Deity in the works of his creative and providential power. Their rea&s;on left to it&s;elf, however corrupt, would &s;till lead them to the knowledge of a God.

<PB N="116" REF="012330_0062_0F88C8FC2AF92CC8">
earth, but they a&s;cribed to their gods. No wonder therefore if they in imitation of their deities, indulged them&s;elves in all manner of vicious and immoral practices. Not but that there were &s;ome exceptions. There were a few choice and enlightned &s;pirits even in the&s;e dark ages, who in a great mea&s;ure broke thro' the&s;e mi&s;ts of ignorance, and entertained more ju&s;t and worthy notions of the &s;upreme being. Thus Socrates, Plato, and &s;ome others, &s;eem to have rea&s;oned well on the unity of the di|vine nature and moral duties. But even the&s;e, however ju&s;t their ideas and conceptions were, conformed in their practices to the cor|ruptions of the times. And as the opinions generally entertained of the Deity, were very gro&s;s and inadequate, their knowledge of the way of rendering them&s;elves &amp; their conduct acceptable to him, mu&s;t be equally fal&s;e and erroneous. They &s;eem to have tru&s;ted al|mo&s;t wholly in external rites, prayers, hymns, &s;acrifices, &amp;c. without tho&s;e internal devo|tions of the &s;oul and tho&s;e &s;piritual &s;acrifices which the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us has taught us, and &s;hewn to be &s;o worthy of God, who being him&s;elf a Spirit, demands a &s;piritual &s;ervice of his rational creatures. They had only the dim light of nature to direct their con|duct, and point out the rules of duty to them: Which though it might lead them to

the knowledge of the chief moral duties, yet the&s;e did but feebly influence their hearts and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ves; becau&s;e they had not that clear know|ledge of them, nor tho&s;e encouragements <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d obligations to practi&s;e them, which we have under the go&s;pel. The mere beauty and amiablene&s;s of virtue in it&s;elf, and the rewards it carries along with it, could not have that efficacy again&s;t the corrupt incli|nations, lu&s;ts and prejudices of men, as when accompanied with the a&s;&s;urance of the divine pre&s;ence here, and acceptance in the coming world. When therefore we behold the great prevalence of iniquity, even under all the motives and encouragements which the go&s;|pel affords to a holy life, we cannot wonder if the heathen world, while di&s;titute of the&s;e encouragements, was more generally cor|rupted and &s;unk in the depths of vice, error and &s;uper&s;tition. Moreover the gentile world before it was enlightned by the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, was not only va&s;tly defective in the knowledge of God, and in the know|ledge, and con&s;equently the practice of reli|gion and holine&s;s, but they know little of them&s;elves, their condition here, the de&s;ign of their creation, and the cau&s;e of that cor|ruption &s;o prevalent in the world.

<P>In fine (for I mu&s;t not enlarge here) The heathen were ignorant in regard to a future &s;tate. Some of them (as Epicurus and his followers) wholly denied the &s;oul's immor|tality and future exi&s;tence. But the greate&s;t part of them had &s;ome dark and confu&s;ed notions of a future &s;tate of rewards and pu|ni&s;hments, which they might derive partly from tradition, and partly from a &s;en&s;e of the ju&s;tice and holine&s;s of the Deity, and the un|equal di&s;tribution of plea&s;ure and pain in this world. But what wild notions did they enter|tain of heaven and hell, of the ely&s;ian fields and internal regions! When we read the&s;e ficti|ons and fancies in their poets, one would be ready to imagine that their de&s;ign was rather to ridicule and burle&s;que, than de&s;cribe a fu|ture
<PB N="119" REF="012330_0063_0F88C8FD173B5F58">
&s;tate. So ignorant were they of that life and immortality which are now brought to light by the go&s;pel. They neverthele&s;s, many of them, entertained &s;trong hopes, not far &s;hort of a&s;&s;urance, that there was a hap|pine&s;s prepared for good men after death. [Witne&s;s Pythagoras, Plato, Socrates, Cicero, &amp;c.] But as to the re&s;urrection of the body, they &s;eem not to have had the lea&s;t imagi|nation or &s;u&s;picion of any &s;uch thing: But &s;uppo&s;ed that at it's di&s;&s;olution by death it wholly cea&s;ed for ever. They had no con|jecture that the&s;e bodies of ours, which are now &s;o frail and brittle, though after death they be corrupted and di&s;&s;olved; yet &s;hall e'er long be called from their du&s;ty bed, re|animated by the power of God, and &s;o re|fined and &s;piritualized as never again to be &s;ubject to di&s;&s;olution or decay.</P>
<P>Thus ignorant was the heathen world. In &s;uch an impenetrable darkne&s;s were we of the Gentiles involved, until the day-&s;pring from high vi&s;ited us; until the light of the glorious go&s;pel &s;hone upon us, and with it's refulgent beams &s;catter'd the&s;e clouds of ig|norance and error, and brought to light the&s;e future glorious &s;cenes of joy, and things in|vi&s;ible to mortal &s;ight. "Ble&s;&s;ed be God therefore, even the Father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who according to his abundant mer|cy"
<PB N="120" REF="012330_0064_0F88C8FDAA6AC7A8">
has not left us to grope in the thick darkne&s;s of heatheni&s;m, void of hope and void of comfort, but "has begotten us again unto a lively hope by the re&s;urrection of Je&s;us Chri&s;t from the dead, to an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled and that fadeth not away, re&s;erved in heaven for us, who are kept by the power of God through faith unto &s;alvation, ready to be revealed in the la&s;t times; wherein we greatly rejoice." 1 Pet. 1.3, 5. I proceed to &s;ay,</P>
<P N="2">II. God winked at the ignorance and cor|ruption of the&s;e times, without bearing any public te&s;timony again&s;t them, except <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the general indications of his providence, until the coming of Chri&s;t. We read not of any prophe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ent to in&s;truct them, or to convert them from the error of their ways, nor of any particular &s;ignal manife&s;tations of the divine judgments again&s;t them, either to puni&s;h them for their wickedne&s;s, or reclaim them from their errors, except in a few &s;ingle cities or individuals, until after Chri&s;t ap|peared on earth, and commi&s;&s;ioned his apo|&s;tles to go and teach all nations what is the true and acceptable way of the Lord. God beheld the generality of the world &s;unk in &s;in and idolatry for &s;o many ages with ap|parent unconcern, and &s;eemingly connived at their ways, until the fulne&s;s of time came,
<PB N="121" REF="012330_0064_0F88C8FDAA6AC7A8">
until the Me&s;&s;iah appeared to de&s;troy the dominions of &s;in and &s;atan, and e&s;tabli&s;hed his own kingdom in the world. This the apo&s;tle Paul declares not only in the text but more fully in his &s;ermon to the men of Ly&s;tra, Acts 14 where he tells them that he was now &s;ent "to preach to them that they &s;hould turn from their vanities unto the liv|ing God, who made heaven and earth, and the &s;ea, and all things therein; who in times pa&s;t &s;uffered all nations to walk in their own ways; neverthele&s;s he left not him&s;elf with|out witne&s;s, in that he did them good, and gave them rain from heaven and fruitful &s;ea&s;ons, filling their hearts with food and gladne&s;s." Here we &s;ee exemplified the goodne&s;s, patience and forbearance of the great Father of mercies, who makes his &s;un to ri&s;e, and his rain to fall on the evil as well as the good. Notwith&s;tanding their igno|rance was in a great mea&s;ure wilful, notwith|&s;tanding their prejudices and perver&s;ene&s;s which hindred them from attending to the intimation of the divine will in his works of creation and providence, notwith&s;tanding they acted in general contrary to the &s;ug|ge&s;tions of their con&s;ciences, or that law of God which was written in their hearts; not|with&s;tanding the&s;e things, I &s;ay, God bore with them from age to age, granted them
<PB N="122" REF="012330_0065_0F88C90092381BB8">
temporal favours in abundance, and after a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of years and of mercies, &s;ent his own &s;on to enlighten and reform them, and receive them into covenant with him&s;elf. "The&s;e things ha&s;t thou done, &s;aith God, and I have kept &s;ilence." Sometimes in|deed God te&s;tified his di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t their wicked ways, by di&s;playing his judgments again&s;t &s;ome particular cities, which had filled up the mea&s;ure of their iniquities. Thus we read of the frequent denunciations of God's wrath again&s;t Egypt, Babylon, Tyre and Sidon, &amp;c. Upon their not attending to which, God utterly de&s;troyed them, for an example to pre&s;ent and after ages.</P>
<P>But as long as they maintained any thing of natural virtue, humanity, and probity a|mong&s;t them, God winked at their many e|normities, becau&s;e they enjoyed but a &s;mall degree of light. For which rea&s;on al&s;o he has declared that their ca&s;e &s;hall be more tolerable at the judgment, than that of tho&s;e who have &s;inned again&s;t the clear light of the go&s;pel. Here is a demon&s;tration of the mercy and compa&s;&s;ion of God to the hea|then world. Tho' God was always equally an enemy to &s;in, yet as he &s;aw not fit then to in&s;truct them by a revelation from heaven, he pa&s;&s;ed by their corruptions in doctrine and wor&s;hip, and in compa&s;&s;ion to their ig|norance,
<PB N="123" REF="012330_0065_0F88C90092381BB8">
withheld his judgments from them. They had not any particular call to repen|tance, nor any direct encouragement to for|givene&s;s upon their renouncing and for&s;aking their &s;ins. Upon the&s;e con&s;iderations God winked at the impenitency of the&s;e dark ages, but <HI>now</HI> under the go&s;pel, commands all men every where to repent, and threatens the &s;ignal manife&s;tations of his vengeance a|gain&s;t all &s;uch as refu&s;e to comply with the gracious invitation.</P>
<P>Or we may con&s;ider the text in another light. We may con&s;ider God's winking at the heathen in their ignorance and corrup|tion, as the ju&s;t judgment of God again&s;t them for their notorious wickedne&s;s and de|te&s;table idolatry. Had they acted agreable to the be&s;t light they had, and appeared ho|ne&s;tly de&s;irous of farther degrees of know|ledge for the &s;ake of performing the divine will in a more perfect manner, God would doubtle&s;s have di&s;patched &s;ome of his &s;er|vants to them, as he often did to his people I&s;rael, to enlighten their minds in the know|ledge of the truth, and declare to them more explicitly what is that good and acceptable thing which the Lord required of them. But when God &s;aw them &s;o little de&s;irous of in|&s;truction, &s;o ob&s;tinate in their prejudices, and firmly attach'd to their errors and vices, he
<PB N="124" REF="012330_0066_0F88C900EEF5D1F0">
gave them up to their own blindne&s;s of mind and hardne&s;s of heart, and &s;uffered them to go on in their ways, without reclaiming them by any expre&s;s me&s;&s;ages from heaven. We may imagine God &s;o di&s;plea&s;ed with them for their flagrant immoralities and violations of the law of nature, as to pronounce con|cerning them as he did of the rebellious Jews by the prophet I&s;aiah, "go and tell this people, hear ye indeed, but under&s;tand not, and &s;ee ye indeed but perceive not: Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and &s;hut their eyes; le&s;t they &s;ee with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and under&s;tand with their hearts, and convert and be healed." This prejudice and per|ver&s;ene&s;s of the Jews, our ble&s;&s;ed Savior him|&s;elf gives as the rea&s;on (and cites this very text) why he did not in&s;truct them more plainly, during his abode on the earth, in things pertaining to the kingdom of heaven, but cho&s;e to declare them only by way of fiction and parable, to be more fully explained by his apo&s;tles after his a&s;cen&s;ion.</P>
<P>And why may not this be &s;uppo&s;ed to be the ca&s;e with the gentile world? It &s;eems to be agreable to the account which St. Paul gives of them in his fir&s;t chapter to the Ro|mans, where he &s;ays, that "the invi&s;ible things of God, even his eternal power and
<PB N="125" REF="012330_0066_0F88C900EEF5D1F0">
godhead, are clearly &s;een by the work of creation; &s;o that they are without excu&s;e: Becau&s;e that when they knew God, they glo|rified him not as God, neither were thank|ful, but became vain in their imaginations, and [&s;o] their fooli&s;h hearts was darkned. Profe&s;&s;ing them&s;elves to be wi&s;e they became fools; and changed the glory of the incor|ruptible God into an image, &amp;c. And &s;o, as they did not like to retain God in their know|ledge, God <HI>gave them over</HI> to a reprobate mind, to do tho&s;e things which are not conve|nient. Becau&s;e that knowing the judgment of God thus far, that they who commit &s;uch things are worthy of death, they not only did the &s;ame, but had plea&s;ure al&s;o in them that did them."</P>
<P>Thus did God for many ages overlook the corruptions of the heathen world; while he cho&s;e out the po&s;terity of Abraham for his own peculiar people, to whom he might more plainly reveal him&s;elf, that they might be a generation to &s;eek him, and a &s;eed to &s;erve him; and that the wor&s;hip of the true God might never wholly cea&s;e among men, 'till Chri&s;t the lamb &s;lain from the foundation of the world, appeared on earth, who gave him|&s;elf a ran&s;om for all, and who commanded his apo&s;tles to go and preach the go&s;pel to every creature, heathen as well as jew, that
<PB N="126" REF="012330_0067_0F88C90178E36E48">
who&s;oever believed on him, for&s;ook his &s;ins, and conformed his life to his in&s;tructions, might be &s;aved by him. This ble&s;&s;ed go&s;pel is what by the grace of God we are favoured with, and the tenor of which we are next to contemplate. I proceed therefore to my</P>
<P N="3">III. Propo&s;ition, which is, that the grand de&s;ign of the go&s;pel revelation is to call men to repentance. "But now commandeth all men every where to repent. The glad news of &s;alvation by Chri&s;t was u&s;hered in by John bapti&s;t his forerunner, who preached the bap|ti&s;m of repentance for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins; and cried in the wilderne&s;s of Judea, "repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." i. e. the di&s;pen&s;ation of the go&s;pel and king|dom of the Me&s;&s;iah is &s;oon to be e&s;tabli&s;hed in the world, repent ye therefore and reform your lives, that ye may become the worthy &s;ubjects of his kingdom. Our ble&s;&s;ed Sa|vior him&s;elf being initiated into his office as it were by bapti&s;m, began his public preach|ing with "repent, for the kingdom of hea|ven is at hand." Mat. 4.17. And when he &s;ent forth the twelve with in&s;tructions to publi&s;h his go&s;pel to the world, they know|ing the general &s;cope and tenor of the doct|rines of their divine ma&s;ter, "went out and preached that men &s;hould repent." For Chri&s;t him&s;elf, when he came into Galilee
<PB N="127" REF="012330_0067_0F88C90178E36E48">
"preaching the go&s;pel of the kingdom of God," did it in the&s;e words, "the time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: "<HI>Repent</HI> ye and believe the go&s;pel." The&s;e two words, repent and believe, comprehend in brief all that the go&s;pel requires of us. But the world, before Chri&s;t, being over|whelmed and &s;unk in the lowe&s;t aby&s;s of ig|norance and idolatry, as we have ju&s;t now &s;een, it was nece&s;&s;ary that they &s;hould repent of all their former &s;ins, and &s;o obtain the for|givene&s;s of them, before they could properly embrace the go&s;pel, and receive the &s;aving benefits of it. For the fir&s;t &s;tep that a vici|ous man can take towards a godly reforma|tion, and &s;uch a thorough change of life as the go&s;pel requires, is to be truly &s;en&s;ible of, and &s;orry for his &s;ins, and &s;o to repent of, and for&s;ake them. Accordingly, "God hath highly exalted Chri&s;t Je&s;us by his right hand, to be a prince and a &s;aviour to give repen|tance and forgivene&s;s of &s;ins." And the a|po&s;tle in his name te&s;tified not only to Jews, but al&s;o to the Greeks, repentance towards God as well as &s;aith in the Lord Je|&s;us Chri&s;t. "It is indeed a faithful &s;aying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t came into the world to &s;ave &s;inners, to &s;ave them from the error and corruption of their ways, to excite them to repent and
<PB N="128" REF="012330_0068_0F88C9022FE36640">
to invite them to accept &s;alvation through him. Had mankind been &s;o holy and guilt|le&s;s as not to &s;tand in need of forgivene&s;s, there had been no nece&s;&s;ity of the go&s;pel re|velation to call and encourage them to re|pent; there had been no occa&s;ion for the de|&s;cent of the &s;on of God from the heaven of glory, to &s;uffer and die, to purcha&s;e pardon for penitent tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors. But &s;ince all man|kind had corrupted his way, and there was none righteous, no not one: Since not only the Heathens who &s;at in darkne&s;s, but the Jews al&s;o who were favoured with a revela|tion from God, had &s;hamefully perverted and violated the divine law; it was requi&s;ite in order to &s;ave mankind from peri&s;hing eter|nally, that there &s;hould be &s;ome other way appointed for their &s;alvation, be&s;ides the ri|gid condition of the covenant of works.</P>
<P>To an&s;wer this gracious end, Chri&s;t came to earth, "whom God hath &s;et forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare <HI>his</HI> righteou&s;ne&s;s for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins that are pa&s;t, through the forbearance of God." And through him "the grace of God, which bringeth &s;alvation, hath appear|ed unto all men, teaching us that denying ungodline&s;s and worldly lu&s;ts, we &s;hould live &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly and godly in this pre|&s;ent world; looking for that ble&s;&s;ed hope,
<PB N="129" REF="012330_0068_0F88C9022FE36640">
and the glorious appearing of the great God, and our Savior Je&s;us Chri&s;t; who gave him|&s;elf for us that he might redeem us from all iniquities, and purify unto him&s;elf a peculiar people, zealous of good works." This is what God the Lord requires of us under this new di&s;pen&s;ation of his grace. For this, Chri&s;t has enlightned us with the light of his glorious go&s;pel, has purcha&s;ed forgivene&s;s by his &s;ufferings, and has promi&s;ed us his holy Spirit to a&s;&s;i&s;t us to for&s;ake our &s;ins and &s;ubdue our lu&s;ts; and on our complying with the&s;e his gracious de&s;igns, has promi&s;ed us pardon and acceptance with God, who&s;e favour is life, and who&s;e loving kindne&s;s is better than life.</P>
<P>Repentance then we &s;ee is a duty indi&s;pen|&s;ably incumbent on all who hope to obtain &s;alvation through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, it therefore de&s;erves a more large and ample con&s;idera|tion. I &s;hall therefore under this head at|tempt to &s;hew the&s;e &s;everal things. 1&s;t. What is implied in true repentance. 2dly. The univer&s;ality of the call and obligation to it. 3dly. The ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of it. And, 4thly. The motives and encouragements gi|ven to it in the go&s;pel. But, I &s;hall conclude at pre&s;ent with one or two reflections on what has been already con&s;idered. And,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="130" REF="012330_0069_0F88C9030244FA78">1. How thankful ought we to be to God, for granting us the light and priviledges of the glorious go&s;pel of the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us, and thereby di&s;pelling the ignorance of heathen|i&s;m, and calling us out of darkne&s;s into mar|vellous light. The greater the darkne&s;s is from which we are delivered, the greater in proportion ought our gratitude to be. We have &s;een what gro&s;s ignorance and error the heathen world before Chri&s;t was involved in; "The gentiles, &s;ays the apo&s;tle, walk in the vanity of their minds, having the under&s;tand|ing darkned, being alienated from the life of God, through the ignorance that is in them, becau&s;e of the blindne&s;s of their hearts." It was almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for them amid&s;t &s;uch thick and palpable darkne&s;s, to di&s;cern the right way and walk in it. Being thus blind|ed and deluded in their minds, it was ea&s;y for &s;atan the prince of darkne&s;s, to lead them captive at his plea&s;ure. But yet methinks, it would not be proper for us, ignorant as we are of the doings and de&s;igns of the al|mighty, utterly to exclude them from hea|ven, and peremptorily to deny the po&s;&s;ibili|ty of the &s;alvation of any of them. The &s;cripture no where that I know of, authori|zes any &s;uch determination; and if we have no ground for it here, certainly that charity which the go&s;pel &s;o frequently inculcates,
<PB N="131" REF="012330_0069_0F88C9030244FA78">
does not require us thus to judge. There were a few even in the dark ages of hea|theni&s;m, who &s;eem to have been rai&s;ed up as glorious lights in the world; and who &s;hone the brighter, for daring to appear ad|vocates for virtue, when the generality of mankind were &s;unk in &s;in and vice.</P>
<P>The&s;e glorious few &s;eem not only to have had pretty ju&s;t notions of God and religion, but to have been &s;incerely de&s;irous to plea&s;e him, to have taken great pains to &s;ubdue their appetites and pa&s;&s;ions, and to cultivate the virtues of a good life. Now there &s;eems to be no ab&s;urdity in &s;uppo&s;ing that a righ|teous and good God &s;hould in &s;ome mea&s;ure grant to &s;uch the divine influences of his &s;pirit, to implant in them a principle of ho|line&s;s, and &s;o far reveal Chri&s;t to them, as is nece&s;&s;ary to their &s;alvation thro' him, as well as to &s;uch as lived under the jewi&s;h di&s;pen&s;ation. It is &s;aid of Cornelius, while he was yet a heathen, "that he was a de|vout man, and one that feared God, that his prayers were heard, and that his alms were had in remembrance before him." And be|ing po&s;&s;e&s;t of the&s;e good qualities, he was dictated by a vi&s;ion where to go and learn Chri&s;t. On which occurrence the apo&s;tle Peter, to whom he was &s;ent, makes this ob|&s;ervation, "of a truth I perceive that God
<PB N="132" REF="012330_0070_0F88C903A99B7188">
is no re&s;pecter of per&s;ons; but in every na|tion, he that feareth God and worketh righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, is accepted with him." Acts 10.4. But whether it &s;hall plea&s;e God to admit any of the heathen to eternal happine&s;s or not, as it does not intimately concern us, and as he has not thought fit expre&s;sly to reveal it to us, &s;o it becomes us not to be peremtory on either hand, but to re&s;t gratefully &s;atisfied with that mea&s;ure of light and knowledge which we are favoured with, and to leave the re&s;t to God, "who will have mercy on whom he will have mercy," a&s;&s;ured that he who has no plea&s;ure in the death or puni&s;hment of any, will extend his mercy and loving kind|ne&s;s &s;o far, and no farther, than &s;hall be con|&s;i&s;tent with equity and ju&s;tice, and the &s;up|port and honour of his moral government. But be this as it may. This we are abun|dantly affored of, that we under the go&s;pel are put into a capacity of obtaining eternal life: That this eternal life and the way to it are revealed to us with &s;ufficient clearne&s;s; that God is ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t our feeble but up|right endeavours after it; that we may, and many of us doubtle&s;s &s;hall be admitted thro' Chri&s;t's merits to the ble&s;&s;ed pre&s;ence and enjoyment of God in heaven. What un|feigned and unbounded thanks are due from us to God, for this un&s;peakable gift! That
<PB N="133" REF="012330_0070_0F88C903A99B7188">
the &s;un of righteou&s;ne&s;s has ari&s;en upon us, and &s;cattered with his glad&s;ome beams the mi&s;ts of heathen ignorance! That the day|&s;pring from on high has vi&s;ited us and diffu|&s;ed the ble&s;&s;ings of light, life &amp; joy among us.</P>
<P>How &s;hould our tongues be exerci&s;ed with repeated no&s;annas to God! How &s;hould our hearts be affected and earth re&s;ound with our prai&s;es to the father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who has ble&s;&s;ed us with the joyful &s;ound of &s;alvation by Chri&s;t; who has revealed to us tho&s;e my&s;teries which have been hid from ages and generations of the world, and has brought to our ears tho&s;e glad tidings of great joy, which many prophets, wi&s;e men and princes de&s;ired to &s;ee and hear, but might not! If we have the lea&s;t &s;en&s;e of grati|tude in our bo&s;oms, or any reli&s;h for divine and &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings, we cannot but be af|fected with love and thankfulne&s;s to God for the&s;e ine&s;timable favours. But,</P>
<P N="2">2. We are bound not only to be thank|ful to God for the go&s;pel, but to comply with the merciful de&s;ign of it, which we have heard is to call men to repentance. It is by this means alone that we can demon&s;trate to our&s;elves and others, that we are truly thankful. If we reject the go&s;pel and live in the practice of tho&s;e immoralities and vi|ces which blackened the heathen world, we
<PB N="134" REF="012330_0071_0F88C9047901A890">
give an undeniable evidence that we are not truly thankful for that go&s;pel which re|proves tho&s;e deeds, and commands us to repent of and for&s;ake them.</P>
<P>Such as thus go on in &s;in, whatever profe&s;&s;ions of thankfulne&s;s they make, would doubtle&s;s be glad that God had never &s;o clearly revealed his will and their duty to them, and the nece&s;&s;ity of their compliance with it. "For he that doth evil hateth the light, neither cometh he to the light, le&s;t his deeds &s;hould be reproved."</P>
<P>Let us therefore &s;hew forth our love and gratitude to God by for&s;aking our &s;ins and cleaning unto him. And may God al|mighty a&s;&s;i&s;t us by his grace hereto. May he "create us anew in Chri&s;t Je&s;us unto good works," and grant us the aids of his Spirit, to &s;ubdue our &s;inful affections, to fortify us again&s;t temptation, and lead us in the paths of truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s for his name &s;ake.

Their notions of a future &s;tate were very erroneous and chimerical, full of doubt &amp; uncertainty: And of the re&s;urrection, they entertained not the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion. They knew not how to &s;ue for pardon and the divine favor, nor in what way, or in what name, it was po&s;&s;ible for them to be reconciled to a ju&s;t and holy God. They &s;eem to have been &s;en&s;ible that a mediator was nece&s;&s;ary, which made them addre&s;s their &s;upplications to Demons, An|gels, departed Heroes, and other inferior Deities.

<P>In the fir&s;t place I am to &s;hew wherein true repentance con&s;i&s;ts, or what is implied in it. Here I &s;hall very briefly mention &s;e|veral things which a &s;incere repentance to|wards

God nece&s;&s;arily includes in it, though all of them perhaps are not felt in equal de|grees by every true penitent. And if any &s;hould chu&s;e to call &s;ome of the things I &s;hall mention, preparatories to true repentance, or concomitants with it, and others of them the ble&s;&s;ed fruits and effects of it, rather than parts of repentance it&s;elf, I will not contend; but only affirm that wherever true repen|tance is, there are found (in a greater or le&s;&s;er degree) the following things: 1. A &s;en&s;e of &s;in and guilt. None can truly re|pent of his &s;ins till he is &s;en&s;ible that he is a &s;in|ner. He mu&s;t be brought to a &s;en&s;e of the great evil and heinous nature of &s;in, and of his expo&s;edne&s;s thereby to the wrath and cur&s;e of God; he mu&s;t &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity there is of breaking off his &s;ins by repentance in order to his obtaining favour and acceptance with the Almighty; otherwi&s;e he cannot ex|erci&s;e a &s;incere and godly repentance. For whil&s;t he thinks him&s;elf innocent, or is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ot convinced of his aggravated guilt, he &s;ees nothing that he has to repent of. It is not &s;uch as are &s;elf-righteous, that by the enabling grace of God are brought to a true repen|tance, but &s;uch as know them&s;elves to be &s;inners, &s;uch as have &s;o thorough and humi|liating conviction of their own vilene&s;s, &s;uch as are of a broken heart and contrite &s;pirit
<PB N="139" REF="012330_0073_0F88C9083AB528D8">
on account of their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of the holy law of God, and are cloathed with that &s;elf-aba&s;ing ornament of humility, which is in the &s;ight of God of great price.</P>
<P>This is admirably exemplified by our Sa|viour in the &s;tory of the conceited Phari&s;ee and convinced Publican, who enter'd the temple together to pay their devotions to God. Whil&s;t the one boa&s;ts of his virtues to claim the divine acceptance, the other &s;en&s;ible of his unworthine&s;s not only to re|ceive the favour of God, but even to lift up his eyes to heaven, &s;mites on his brea&s;t, and exclaims, "Lord, be merciful to me a &s;in|ner." He being thus convinced of his &s;in|fulne&s;s and guilt, was in a proper di&s;po&s;ition of mind to receive the pardon and favour of God; and accordingly "he went down to his hou&s;e ju&s;tified rather than the other." He that is duly &s;en&s;ible of the great need he &s;tands in of the divine forgivene&s;s, of his own unworthine&s;s of it, and of the nece&s;&s;ity of the merits and mediation of Chri&s;t in order to it, cannot but be &s;orry that he has bro't him&s;elf into &s;uch a woful &s;tate by &s;in; and will be excited to the &s;tronge&s;t de&s;ires and endeavours to for&s;ake his &s;ins, and plea&s;e God, who&s;e di&s;plea&s;ure he has incurred by &s;inning: And &s;uch a one has ample encou|ragement to expect the a&s;&s;i&s;tance and accep|tance

of God, who with &s;uch a &s;acrifice is well plea&s;ed." "For thus &s;aith the high and lofty One who inhabiteth eternity, who&s;e name is holy, I dwell in the high and holy place, and with him al&s;o that is of a contrite and <HI>humble</HI> &s;pirit, to revive the &s;pirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the con|trite ones. I have &s;een his ways, and will heal him, peace, peace to him," &amp;c. I&s;a. 57.15.</P>
<P N="2">2. True repentance implies in it not only a convicted &s;en&s;e of our manifold &s;in and guilt, but a humble <HI>acknowledgment</HI> of them before God. He that covereth his &s;ins &s;hall not pro&s;per, but who&s;o confe&s;&s;eth and for|&s;aketh them &s;hall have mercy." And "if we confe&s;s our &s;ins, he is faithful and ju&s;t to forgive us our &s;ins, and to clean&s;e us from all unrighteou&s;ne&s;s." So that we cannot truly repent of our &s;ins, &s;o as to obtain mer|cy and forgivene&s;s, without penitent con|fe&s;&s;ion of them. I acknowledge my tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions, &s;ays David; and my &s;in is ever before me. It is nece&s;&s;ary that we confe&s;s in general, that we have &s;inned and done that which is not right, that we have in many in&s;tances broken God's holy law, and acted contrary to tho&s;e obligations of duty and gratitude we were under to him; that here|by we have ju&s;tly incen&s;ed him again&s;t us, and expo&s;ed our&s;elves to his wrath, and the
<PB N="141" REF="012330_0074_0F88C908E9D25450">
&s;ad effects of his di&s;plea&s;ure. And not only &s;o, but when we fall into any great or pre|&s;umptuous &s;ins, we ought particularly to recount and confe&s;s them before God, with their &s;everal aggravations, and with a con|trition in &s;ome mea&s;ure proportioned to the guilt of them. Whereas a general confe&s;&s;i|on only, (if &s;incere) will be accepted for tho&s;e many &s;ins which we cannot particularly call to remembrance, for our &s;ins of ignorance and infirmity, and the daily imperfections of our be&s;t &s;ervices. And our confe&s;&s;ions both general and particular, mu&s;t be accompanied with hearty de&s;ires and earne&s;t prayers for forgivene&s;s. Thus David prays particular|ly, "Deliver me from blood-guiltine&s;s, O my God; and in general, "clean&s;e thou me from &s;ecret faults." God requires confe&s;&s;ion of us not to inform him, (for he is perfectly accquainted with all our thoughts and ways) but for our own good, to im|pre&s;s on our hearts a humiliating &s;en&s;e of our &s;ins, and to &s;hew forth our penitent di&s;|po&s;ition of mind. Such a di&s;po&s;ition as will fit us for receiving pardon from God, "who looketh upon man, as Elihu &s;aith, and if any &s;ay, I have &s;inned and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not: He will deliver his &s;oul from going into the pit, and his life &s;hall &s;ee the light." Job 33.27, 28.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="142" REF="012330_0075_0F88C90A839FF2B0">3. Our confe&s;&s;ion mu&s;t be accompanied with &s;hame and &s;orrow for our &s;ins, &s;uch a &s;orrow as &s;hall produce hatred and abhor|rence of them, otherwi&s;e we &s;hall not be &s;in|cere in our confe&s;&s;ions, and in our purpo&s;es of amendment. For he that confe&s;&s;es a fault is always &s;uppo&s;ed to be convinced of it. And he that is convinced that he has done ami&s;s, cannot but be a&s;hamed of it. Thus Ezra lamented, and confe&s;&s;ing before God the &s;ins of the land, &s;ays, "O my God, I am <HI>a&s;hamed</HI> and blu&s;h to lift up my face to thee, my God; for our iniquities are increa&s;ed over our head, and our tre&s;pa&s;s is grown up unto the heavens." So Jeremiah 3.25. "We lie down in our <HI>&s;hame,</HI> and our con|fu&s;ion covereth us, for we have &s;inned again&s;t the Lord." Evangelical repentance is al&s;o attended with great grief and &s;orrow for &s;in. I will declare mine iniquity, &s;ays the P&s;almi&s;t, and be &s;orry for my &s;in. The &s;incere peni|tent mourns and &s;orrows for his &s;ins, not only becau&s;e he has by them &s;ubjected him|&s;elf to the wrath of God &amp; pains of hell. For a &s;inner that is actuated by a mere legal prin|ciple, who continues to love &s;in and is re|&s;olved to go on in it, may yet like Judas, be filled with &s;orrow and remor&s;e, on ac|count of the great mi&s;chief and intolerable mi&s;ery which he has brought upon him&s;elf.
<PB N="143" REF="012330_0075_0F88C90A839FF2B0">
Such &s;orrow, &s;uch repentance as this, &s;hall be exerci&s;ed by the damned in hell, and con|&s;equently is not in it&s;elf that gracious af|fection of &s;oul which recommends to the fa|vour of God. But &s;orrow for &s;in, which is the concomitant of true repentance, is of a more ingenious nature. It proceeds chiefly (though not wholly excluding the other prin|ciple) from love and gratitude towards God, and a conciou&s;ne&s;s of having acted unwor|thily towards him who is his Creator and con&s;tant Benefactor, and who has &s;ent his own &s;on to ran&s;om him from &s;in and de|&s;truction. He is grieved for having acted unworthy of a rational creature, for having deformed and defiled his own &s;oul, reflected di&s;honour on God, and di&s;obeyed his righ|teous laws. This is that "godly &s;orrow" that "worketh repentance to &s;alvation not to be repented of." He who thus &s;incerely laments his &s;in, and &s;orrows after a godly &s;ort, who weeps and grieves more bitterly, the greater his &s;in and folly has been, will be led to hate &s;in and loathe him&s;elf on account of it.

<P N="4">4. He who&s;e grief and repentance for his &s;ins is &s;incere, will firmly <HI>re&s;olve</HI> to for&s;ake them for the future, and cleave unto God. And unle&s;s this is the happy effect of it, his repentance is not genuine, but only that re|luctance
<PB N="144" REF="012330_0076_0F88C90B334EE340">
and unea&s;ine&s;s which naturally ari&s;es in the mind of man, from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having done wrong, and a fear of puni&s;hment. Without a firm and vigorous re&s;olution, nothing can be done towards repentance and a change of life. When a &s;inner is brought to reflect on his pa&s;t life, and &s;ees how guilty he has been; when he is convinced of the evil and danger of his former cour&s;es, and that the only &s;afe way for him is to for&s;ake his &s;in and return to God and his duty; how|ever &s;trongly he is determined in his mind upon the expediency of repentance, yet un|le&s;s there is a fixed determination or <HI>re&s;olution</HI> of the will al&s;o, true repentance will not en|&s;ue. For though it is nece&s;&s;ary that the de|termination of the judgment &s;hould go be|fore the re&s;olution of the will, yet the one does not always imply the other. Many men have been fully convinced of the fitne&s;s and nece&s;&s;ity of a change of life, who yet for want of a &s;tedfa&s;t re&s;olution to turn from their &s;ins, have gone on in them and died in a &s;tate of impenitence. Nothing but a &s;trong and determinate re&s;olution will enable a man to &s;tem the torrent of vicious cu&s;tom, to conquer his own &s;inful inclinations, and the &s;trength of inveterate habits, and to with&s;tand the powerful a&s;&s;aults of temptation. Weak and feeble purpo&s;es of amendment will not
<PB N="145" REF="012330_0076_0F88C90B334EE340">
do this. Such as only faintly wi&s;h and in|tend to repent and reform, will be ea&s;ily &s;way'd to &s;in: Whereas he who upon ma|ture deliberation and &s;incere de&s;ires to glo|rify God in his life, has taken up a firm re|&s;olution to cea&s;e from &s;in and go on in a way of duty, will doubtle&s;s be able, by help of divine grace, to keep his re&s;olution. For re&s;olution fixes a man's &s;pirit, like an im|moveable rock, which when the rains de&s;cend and floods a&s;&s;ail it, abides firm again&s;t all impre&s;&s;ions. By virtue of &s;uch a re&s;olution as this, David could ri&s;e in defiance again&s;t all that would tempt him to &s;in, &s;aying, "depart from me, ye evil doers, for <HI>I will</HI> keep the commandments of my God."&mdash; Thus we &s;ee how nece&s;&s;ary a part holy re&s;o|lution is, of true repentance. Again,</P>
<P N="5">5. That chri&s;tian repentance which the go&s;pel requires, includes in it, a repairing to Chri&s;t, relying on his merits alone for for|givene&s;s, and ca&s;ting the guilty &s;oul before him to be wa&s;hed in his blood, and clean&s;ed from all &s;in. Faith in Chri&s;t, and tru&s;t in him for acceptance, is the root and founda|tion of all the chri&s;tian graces; and de&s;titute of this principle, they are not evangelical graces, but mere moral acts, &s;uch as may be exerci&s;ed by Pagans as well as Chri&s;tians. An Infidel, Heathen, or Jew, may be hearti|ly
<PB N="146" REF="012330_0077_0F88C90CAB358600">
grieved and &s;orry for his &s;ins, and re&s;olve to for&s;ake them; and in con&s;equence of this may turn from his allowed vicious cour&s;es, and cultivate in general the moral virtues of a good life. But this repentance, though it be commendable and prai&s;e worthy in him, yet being de&s;titute of faith in Chri&s;t, it is not evangelical repentance which is required of us under the chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation. Weary and heavy-laden &s;inners, who labour under a burden&s;ome &s;en&s;e of their &s;ins, are com|manded in the go&s;pel, not only to repent of and for&s;ake them, but to come to Chri&s;t for pardon, that &s;o being ea&s;ed of the heavy load, they may find re&s;t for their &s;ouls. Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who gave him&s;elf a ran&s;om for all, who was delivered up to death for our offences, and ro&s;e again for our ju&s;tification, has by his obedience and &s;ufferings made a compleat atonement and &s;atisfaction for &s;in. In con&s;equence of which God has highly ex|alted him by his right hand, to give <HI>repen|tance</HI> and <HI>remi&s;&s;ion</HI> of &s;ins. "Through him therefore is preached unto you the forgive|ne&s;s of &s;ins: And by him all that believe are ju&s;tified from all things, from which ye could not be ju&s;tified by the law of Mo&s;es." Thus as the <HI>forgivene&s;s of &s;ins</HI> is conferred only <HI>through Chri&s;t,</HI> and as repentance is in order to forgivene&s;s, it is nece&s;&s;ary that our repen|tance
<PB N="147" REF="012330_0077_0F88C90CAB358600">
&s;hould have a particular reference to Chri&s;t; or that a go&s;pel penitent &s;hould ex|erci&s;e faith in him, <HI>by whom we receive the atonement.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>That</HI> repentance which is &s;incere and genuine, nece&s;&s;arily implies in it, or at lea&s;t produces, actual reformation and change of life; a for&s;aking of &s;in, and practice of virtue and piety. It has been already &s;hewn that repentance includes in it a deep and hearty <HI>&s;orrow</HI> for &s;in, with a di&s;po&s;ition of mind, and a re&s;olution of will to turn from it. But this, if we &s;top here, is not true repentance. Repentance &s;ignifies <HI>a change,</HI> not only of di&s;po&s;ition but of practice; not only a re&s;o|lution to walk in the way of duty, but an actual performing &s;uch a re&s;olution, &s;o far as opportunity is granted for it. In affairs of common life, by repenting we frequently mean no more than a &s;orrow for any pa&s;t action, which upon reflection we find to have been wrong, and to wi&s;h that we had done otherwi&s;e. But this though it is implied in go&s;pel repentance, does not come up to the full notion of it, neither is it what is mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential to it. For what availeth the mo&s;t poignant &s;orrows and compunction, unle&s;s it worketh repentance, or a thorough change of heart and life? How can grief or remor&s;e alone, either plea&s;e God or profit us? Sorrow
<PB N="148" REF="012330_0078_0F88C90DB4D59AB0">
in it&s;elf is only pain and mi&s;ery. There can|not therefore be a greater affront and indig|nity offered to God, who delights in the happine&s;s of his creatures, than to &s;uppo&s;e that he takes a cruel plea&s;ure in the mi&s;ery of men; or that he delights to &s;ee them in|volved in tears, and labouring under trouble of mind and remor&s;e of con&s;cience for their &s;ins, any further than as this conduces to the reformation and happine&s;s of the per&s;ons thus affected. Our grieving and taking on can|not affect the almighty, nor move his com|pa&s;&s;ion towards us, whil&s;t we continue in &s;in: Neither does he count him&s;elf glorified by pain or melancholy; but "<HI>herein</HI> is my father glorified, &s;aith our Savior, that ye bring forth much fruit." What per&s;ons feel a more painful &s;orrow and contrition for &s;in, than &s;uch as are &s;unk into the depths of de|&s;pair? Yet who are farther from true repen|tance? If grief and affliction of &s;oul for hav|ing &s;inned were all that con&s;tituted go&s;pel repentance, the devil him&s;elf might become a true penitent: For he, when he feelst he ju&s;t vengeance of God, cannot but condemn him&s;elf, and grieve that ever he rebelled a|gain&s;t him: But as he remains the &s;ame devil &s;till, retains the &s;ame malignant temper, and continues the &s;ame cour&s;e of wickedne&s;s and rebellion, he is at the farthe&s;t remove po&s;&s;ible
<PB N="149" REF="012330_0078_0F88C90DB4D59AB0">
from true repentance. Thus we &s;ee, that grief and &s;orrow are of no advantage, any farther than as they are productive of a real repentance and reformation. So that if we would determine what is <HI>godly &s;orrow</HI> and what not, we mu&s;t judge of it, not from the degree of affliction in it, but from the real effects of it in heart and life. For he is mo&s;t truly &s;orry for his &s;in, that reflects upon it with dete&s;tation, and ab&s;olutely &s;huns and for&s;akes it. The go&s;pel repentance is called repentance from dead works;" not only for them, but from them. The grace of God by Chri&s;t Je&s;us, was not revealed to the world to inflict torment and mi&s;ery on men, or to make them &s;ad and melancholy, but to &s;ubdue &s;in in them and under them, to teach and direct them to "deny ungodline&s;s and worldly lu&s;ts, and to live &s;oberly, righ|teou&s;ly and godly, in the world." When John bapti&s;t came preaching the bapti&s;m of repentance, and when many people were bapti&s;ed by him, and <HI>confe&s;&s;ed their &s;ins,</HI> he lets them know that this alone was not &s;ufficient, but that it was nece&s;&s;ary that they &s;hould al&s;o <HI>bring forth fruits meet for re|pentance.</HI> A good tree will infallibly bring forth good fruit. However humbly and penitently therefore we have confe&s;&s;ed our &s;ins, however deeply we have been affected
<PB N="150" REF="012330_0079_0F88C90E2A7942B0">
with &s;orrow and angui&s;h for them, however vile we have e&s;teemed our&s;elves on account of them, and however &s;trongly we have de|termined to for&s;ake them, yet if we do not actually cea&s;e the indulgence of them, and practice the virtues of a holy life, when time and opportunity is granted herefor, we may be a&s;&s;ured beyond all doubt, that we have not yet exerci&s;ed that true repentance to|wards God which the go&s;pel requires of us. Every true penitent becomes thenceforward <HI>a new creature.</HI> He is "created anew in Chri&s;t Je&s;us unto good works," By the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the divine Spirit, "he puts off the old man which is corrupt, and puts on the new," repentance being nece&s;&s;arily con|nected or concomitant with regeneration and conver&s;ion. "Repent ye therefore, and <HI>be converted,</HI> that your &s;ins may be blotted out." I proceed to &s;ay,</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Re&s;titution</HI> is a nece&s;&s;ary branch or effect of &s;incere repentance. It is a dictate of natural rea&s;on as well as of religion, that whenever any wrong or injury is done to a|nother, a full re&s;titution or &s;atisfaction ought (&s;o far as can be) to be made to the party injured. As to our tre&s;pa&s;&s;es again&s;t God, we can make no adequate compen&s;ation for them. All we can do in re&s;pect of God, is humbly to confe&s;s our faults, to be heartily
<PB N="151" REF="012330_0079_0F88C90E2A7942B0">
&s;orry for them, and do better for the future. Though this does not come up to the notion of re&s;titution or &s;atisfaction, yet God is gra|ciou&s;ly plea&s;ed through Chri&s;t to accept it as &s;uch, when performed &s;incerely and from the heart. But be&s;ides the wrong done to God and our&s;elves; in many of our &s;ins we likewi&s;e injure our fellow-men. In this ca&s;e we may and ought to make reparation. If we have by our example, influence, or en|ticements, drawn any into &s;in, and thereby endangered their precious &s;ouls, we are bound &s;o far as we can, to reclaim them from their vices, and promote their &s;alvation. Or in whatever other way we have injured any per&s;on, whether by fraud or violence; whether the wrong affects his body, e&s;tate or reputation; we are obliged to re&s;tore what we have unju&s;tly detained from him, or o|therwi&s;e make &s;atisfaction, according as the ca&s;e and circum&s;tances require. And unle&s;s we do thus, we do not &s;incerely repent of the &s;in. For he that is truly penitent and &s;orry for his &s;in, will heartily wi&s;h he had not done it, and &s;o will be careful &s;o far as he can to <HI>undo</HI> it by making re&s;titution. Whil&s;t a man wilfully neglects making re|paration for any act of inju&s;tice, oppre&s;&s;ion, de&s;amation, &amp;c. he continues in the &s;in; and whil&s;t he continues in the &s;in, and does

not for&s;ake it, the guilt of it &s;hall not be wa&s;hed away. [Non dimittitur peccatum, ni&s;i re&s;tituatur ablatum.] The &s;criptures mention re&s;titution as a nece&s;&s;ary part of repentance, and an indi&s;pen&s;ible condition of pardon. Thus Ezekiel 33.14, &amp;c.&mdash; "When I &s;ay unto the wicked, thou &s;hall &s;urely die: If he <HI>turn</HI> from his &s;in and do that which is lawful and right; if the wicked <HI>re&s;tore the pledge, give again that which he hath robbed,</HI> and walk in the &s;tatutes of life without committing iniquity; none of his &s;ins that he hath committed &s;hall be menti|oned unto him; he &s;hall &s;urely live, he &s;hall not die."</P>
<P N="8">8. That our repentance be &s;incere, and effectual to procure the pardon of our &s;ins, it is nece&s;&s;ary that we forgive the offences of others again&s;t us. That this is a nece&s;&s;ary concomitant of true repentance, I prove thus. The divine forgivene&s;s is often promi&s;ed us on our &s;incere repentance: "Repent and be converted that your &s;ins may be blotted out." "If the wicked turn, he &s;hall live, &amp;c. But our Savior expre&s;ly declares, that "if we forgive not men their tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, nei|ther will our heavenly father forgive us." Con&s;equently that repentance to which the promi&s;e of pardon is annexed, mu&s;t include in it, forgivene&s;s of others. Indeed the
<PB N="153" REF="012330_0080_0F88C910D1D66FD0">
practice of all the duties of chri&s;tianity, &s;o far as by God's grace we are able, is, as I have already &s;hewn, comprehended in true repentance. But this duty of forgiving o|thers is more particularly in&s;i&s;ted on in the go&s;pel, as of peculiar efficacy in order to our obtaining pardon of God. If we forgive men their tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, and not otherwi&s;e, God will forgive us all tho&s;e &s;ins which we have utterly for&s;aken and renounced. And this is a very ju&s;t and equitable requi&s;ition.</P>
<P>For if God is ready to forgive us our hei|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ous and aggravated tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions upon our penitently a&s;king it of him, how can we in con&s;cience or gratitude refu&s;e to overlook the &s;light and incon&s;iderable offences of o|thers again&s;t us? When we read the &s;tory of the &s;ervant who being freely forgiven by his Lord a va&s;t debt of ten thou&s;and talents, yet refu&s;ed to forgive or have patience with his needy and &s;upplicating fellow-&s;ervant for the &s;mall &s;um of one hundred pence, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">elentle&s;ly con&s;igned him to pri&s;on and mi&s;|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ry; the con&s;cience of every one cannot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ut &s;ub&s;cribe to the ju&s;tice of the &s;entence of his being delivered to the tormentors, until <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e &s;hould make &s;atisfaction for the whole debt. "So likewi&s;e &s;hall my heavenly fa|ther do unto you, &s;ays Chri&s;t, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother
<PB N="154" REF="012330_0081_0F88C911318448E8">
their tre&s;pa&s;&s;es." If therefore we would e|vidence our repentance to be true and un|feigned, &s;uch as &s;hall avail with God through Chri&s;t for our pardon, we mu&s;t "be kind one to another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, when as God for Chri&s;t's &s;ake hath forgiven us."</P>
<P>La&s;tly. That our repentance be effectual to our final &s;alvation, it is nece&s;&s;ary that we not only change our lives at fir&s;t, and turn from &s;in to God, but that we continue in &s;uch a cour&s;e to the end. "He that con|tinueth to the end &s;hall be &s;aved; but if any man draw back, my &s;oul &s;hall have no plea|&s;ure in him." There are many who by &s;ome awakening call either in the word or pro|vidence of God, are brought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> dan|ger of their &s;tate, to mourn <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ns, and alter or amend their lives <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ntinue for &s;ome time to all appearance &s;incerely reli|gious. But the&s;e good impre&s;&s;ions being worn off by time, they relap&s;e into their former &s;tate of inactivity and wickedne&s;s, and &s;hew by their after-conduct that their former repentance was not e&s;tabli&s;hed on a good and la&s;ting principle. Now the re|pentance of &s;uch as thus afterwards fall a|way (if it may be called repentance) will not avail to their final happine&s;s. All their for|mer &s;trivings and &s;orrows will not an&s;wer for
<PB N="155" REF="012330_0081_0F88C911318448E8">
their admi&s;&s;ion into heaven. For &s;aith God, "when I &s;ay to the righteous, thou &s;halt &s;urely live; if he tru&s;t to his own righte|ou&s;ne&s;s [and turn a&s;ide] and commit iniqui|ty; all his righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall not be remem|bered; but for his iniquity that he hath committed, he &s;hall die for it." So that a con&s;tant and &s;teady progre&s;s in virtue is e&s;&s;ential to that repentance unto &s;alvation, which the go&s;pel requires. And by this it is di&s;tingui&s;hed from that repentance which is vain and unavailing.</P>
<P>Thus I have con&s;idered the &s;everal things which are either contained in true repentance or accompany it, or el&s;e flow from it. They are a &s;en&s;e of &s;ins, confe&s;&s;ion of them with &s;hame and &s;orrow, re&s;olution again&s;t them, applying to Chri&s;t for forgivene&s;s, an actual reformation in heart and life, re&s;titution, for|givene&s;s, and per&s;i&s;tance in virtue and god|line&s;s. Before I proceed to the next head, I would ju&s;t make one remark. Though each of the&s;e I have mentioned (as parts of true repentance) are nece&s;&s;ary, yet they are not <HI>equally</HI> di&s;cernible in every go&s;pel-peni|tent. Such as have had the happine&s;s of a religious education, who&s;e infant minds have had the principles of chri&s;tianity in&s;tilled into them, and who have been brought up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord,
<PB N="156" REF="012330_0082_0F88C911E95CF188">
though in their repentance they mourn for their &s;ins and imperfections, yet not having been guilty of any notorious tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, their &s;orrow will not be equal in degree to that of others: And as the general tenor of their actions has always been outwardly con|formed to the rules of religion, the change that is made in them will not be &s;o con&s;pi|cuous and evident to them&s;elves and others, as in tho&s;e that are reformed from a cour&s;e of profligancy and vice. But though the repentance and renovation of &s;uch is more &s;ilent and in&s;en&s;ible, yet it is nece&s;&s;ary that they as well as all others &s;hould repent and be renewed in the temper of their minds, before they can be &s;o conformed to the im|age of God as to enjoy happine&s;s with him. For "God commandeth <HI>all men every where</HI> to repent." I proceed therefore to con&s;ider, as I propo&s;ed,</P>
<P N="2">II. The univer&s;ality of the call and obli|gation to repentance. Before Chri&s;t, the re|velation of God's will, and the invitation to repentance for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins, was made only to the Jews. Many prophets were &s;ent forth by the almighty, command|ing and exhorting <HI>them</HI> to repent and turn from their evil ways, with promi&s;es that hereupon they &s;hould live and not die. But &s;ince the preaching of the go&s;pel, the true
<PB N="157" REF="012330_0082_0F88C911E95CF188">
religion is not as before, confined to any one nation or country, "but in every nation he that feareth God and worketh righteou&s;ne&s;s is accepted of him." God has now graci|ou&s;ly fulfilled his promi&s;e made by his pro|phets to call the gentile world to the faith. "Is he the God of the Jews only? Is he not al&s;o of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gen|tiles al&s;o." Every man every where, who hears the ble&s;&s;ed &s;ound of the go&s;pel, is now called upon to repent. Even the greate&s;t &s;inners have encouragement here. For "it is a faithful &s;aying&mdash;that Chri&s;t Je&s;us came into the world to &s;ave &s;inners, even the chief." And ju&s;t before his entrance into glory, he gave orders to his apo&s;tles, "that repentance and remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins &s;hould be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jeru&s;alem, who were the chief of &s;inners, the de&s;pi&s;ers and crucifiers of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord. But not only great and no|torious tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, but &s;uch al&s;o as have led more regular and moral lives, are com|manded to repent. For as all men have &s;inned and therefore &s;tand in need of for|givene&s;s, &s;o all are invited to accept of it on go&s;pel terms. Even the righteous or &s;uch as have already turned their feet into the way of God's te&s;timonies, though the general tenor of their actions being right, they have
<PB N="158" REF="012330_0083_0F88C9149DFB1068">
not need like the &s;inner to turn wholly about, and change their cour&s;e, yet they ought fre|quently to renew their repentance. Though the loud calls in &s;cripture to repent and turn, are directed chiefly to &s;inners, and though that repentance which I have de&s;cribed, im|plying a thorough change, can in the extent of it be applied only to them, yet there is a repen|tance which is required of &s;uch as are already true penitents and believers. For &s;ince none can arrive to a &s;tate of impeccability or &s;in|le&s;s perfection in this life, the grace of God in the go&s;pel would be in&s;ufficient to the &s;al|vation of any, if it provided not for the par|don of &s;ins committed after the fir&s;t repen|tance as well as before. The be&s;t of men, the mo&s;t eminent &s;aints, will &s;ometimes not|with&s;tanding their utmo&s;t caution, fall into &s;in, and fail in the exact performance of their duty; and while any are under the guilt of any &s;in, they are expo&s;ed to the wrath and cur&s;e of God: It is nece&s;&s;ary therefore that they recover them&s;elves, and be renewed a|gain unto repentance in order to their being re&s;tored to the favour of God. They mu&s;t mourn for their remaining imperfections; and whenever they are &s;urprized into &s;in, mu&s;t penitently a&s;k forgivene&s;s thro' Chri&s;t, and be excited to greater caution and vigi|lance in their future conduct. Thus all men,
<PB N="159" REF="012330_0083_0F88C9149DFB1068">
good and bad, high and low, bond and free, are called to repentance, and &s;o invited to the benefits of the go&s;pel redemption. For with God "there is no re&s;pect of per&s;ons,&mdash;there is neither Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free; but Chri&s;t is all and in all."&mdash;I am,</P>
<P N="3">III. To &s;hew the nece&s;&s;ity of repentance. And this, as there needs not much to be &s;aid to make it evident, &s;o I &s;hall not be long upon it. Without it we cannot be pardoned. For God is holy, and cannot be reconciled to &s;in. His nature is oppo&s;ite to it, and his laws were de&s;igned to re&s;train men from it But to forgive &s;in without repentance and amendment, is the direct way to encourage the practice of it, and de&s;troy the honour and reverence due to tho&s;e laws which &s;o &s;everely forbid it. We cannot enjoy happine&s;s in the communion of God, until we become like him, or he like us. But God is un|changeable. Con&s;equently we mu&s;t for&s;ake our &s;ins, and become in &s;ome degree holy as God is holy, before we can be happy with him. Nay, &s;hould God, contrary to his nature and word, forgive our &s;ins tho' in|dulg'd and unrepented of, and admit us in|to his beatific pre&s;ence, &s;till we could not forgive our&s;elves. Con&s;cience, that inex|orable Judge which God has placed in our brea&s;t, will not free us from the &s;ting of
<PB N="160" REF="012330_0084_0F88C9150288B268">
guilt, till we have repented and reformed. And &s;o long as a &s;en&s;e of guilt remained, we could not be happy. Thus in the nature of things, happine&s;s and impenitency are ab&s;o|lutely incompatible with each other. This is farther evident from the word of God. Sinners or "the unrighteous cannot inherit the kingdom of God." "The wicked &s;hall go away into everla&s;ting puni&s;hment." "God is angry with the wicked every day: If he turn not he will whet his &s;word, and his mi&s;chief &s;hall return upon his own head." "Except ye repent ye &s;hall all likewi&s;e pe|ri&s;h." "Ble&s;&s;ed are the pure in heart, for they &s;hall &s;ee God:" But "without holi|ne&s;s no man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord." Every man who con&s;ults the word of God, who &s;ees there the woful end of the impenitent &s;inner, and the glorious happine&s;s of the par|doned &s;aint, cannot but be &s;en&s;ible of the im|portance and nece&s;&s;ity of repentance. And &s;ince the pre&s;ent life is known to be the only time allotted for it, one would think it im|po&s;&s;ible that any &s;hould be &s;o unwi&s;e as to neglect or delay it. But this being unhap|pily the ca&s;e, we will con&s;ider in the</P>
<P N="4">IV. and la&s;t place, the motives and en|couragements to repentance which the go&s;|pel affords. The impenitency of the hea|then was winked at by God, becau&s;e they
<PB N="161" REF="012330_0084_0F88C9150288B268">
had little or no encouragement to it. But this is not the ca&s;e under the go&s;pel. Here we find God declaring him&s;elf "not willing any &s;hould peri&s;h, but that all &s;hould come to repentance." And that for this very rea&s;on "he is long-&s;uffering to us-ward," "that the goodne&s;s of God may lead us to repentance." Here we have the promi&s;e of pardon and remi&s;&s;ion, on our &s;incerely and truly repenting of our &s;ins; and a promi&s;e of the divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance herein, and not only &s;o, but we are a&s;&s;ured that there is a crown of glory that fadeth not away, re&s;erved in heaven for us. The great and manifold ble&s;&s;ings of redemption, the divine ble&s;&s;ing and fellow&s;hip of the &s;pirit here, and the en|joyment of God throughout eternity, are promi&s;ed to &s;uch as for&s;ake their &s;ins, &s;ub|due their lu&s;ts, and are renewed in the &s;pirit of their minds after the image of him that created them. But if we refu&s;e to hearken to the gracious calls of God to repentance and a holy life, and ob&s;tinately go on in &s;in "after our hard and impenitent hearts, we trea&s;ure up to our&s;elves wrath again&s;t the day of wrath, and the revelation of the righ|teous judgment of God; who will render to every man according to his deeds: to them who by patient continuance in well doing &s;eek for glory and honour and im|mortality,
<PB N="162" REF="012330_0085_0F88C915B10B9E48">
eternal life." Having therefore tho&s;e promi&s;es, dearly beloved, let us clean&s;e our&s;elves from all filthine&s;s of the fle&s;h and &s;pirit, perfecting holine&s;s in the fear of God."</P>
<P>Let us con&s;ider that whil&s;t we go on in a &s;tate of impenitency, we counteract the gracious de&s;igns of God in the go&s;pel reve|velation. In vain has God provided a re|deemer for us to deliver us from &s;in and death: In vain as to us has Chri&s;t died to purcha&s;e pardon and ju&s;tification for &s;inful man, and thereby to reconcile him to an offended God: In vain has God enlightened us with the knowledge of his will, and the terms on which we may procure his favor; if we &s;tand out again&s;t his exhortations and calls, and are wilfully bent on our own de|&s;truction. Nay it will be the un&s;peakable ag|gravation of our future doom, that the grace of God bringing &s;alvation has appeared to us, but we have harden'd our hearts again&s;t God, and refu&s;ed compliance with it.&mdash; Though God winked at the impenitency of the heathen in the times of ignorance, he will not wink at it in profe&s;&s;ed chri&s;tians under the light of the go&s;pel; but will a&s;&s;uredly execute his threatned vengeance on all that now daringly continue in &s;in. "Now con&s;ider this ye that forget God,

left he tear you in pieces and there be none to deliver." Rom. 16.25, 26, 27.</P>
<P>"Now to him that is of power to &s;tabli&s;h you according to the go&s;pel, and the preach|ing of Je&s;us Chri&s;t (according to the reve|lation of the my&s;tery, which was kept &s;ecret &s;ince the world began, but now is made manife&s;t, and by the &s;criptures of the pro|phets according to the commandment of the everla&s;ting God, made known to all nations for the obedience of faith: To God only wi&s;e, be glory through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for ever.</P>

<HEAD>His Character from Me&s;&s;iu'rs FLEET's Evening Po&s;t.</HEAD>
<P>DIED at the Rev. Mr. Smith's at Wey|mouth, the 17th in&s;tant, James Blake, B. A. and was this day decently interred at Dorche&s;ter, the place of his nativity. Early in life he di&s;covered a love for virtue and a thir&s;t for knowledge. His ri&s;ing genius induced his friends to give him a liberal edu|cation at Harvard College. He made a mo&s;t rapid progre&s;s in the arts and &s;ciences, and as a univer&s;al &s;cholar was equal perhaps to any of his &s;tanding. Inten&s;e application to his &s;tudies, impaired his health, and from an extreme aver&s;ion to di&s;tre&s;s his friends with his complaints, he concealed his difficulties, 'till an inflammation &s;eated on his &s;tomach, which removed him from this world in the bloom and verdure of life. Being &s;oon ripe for heaven, heaven claimed him as it's due. For &s;ome months pa&s;t he had preached in this and the neighbouring towns, occa&s;ion|ally, to the univer&s;al approbation of his hearers, and the be&s;t judges have acknow|ledged his di&s;cour&s;es from the pulpit were

He appeared ever to be influenced by the example of his divine Lord and Ma&s;ter, in who&s;e &s;ervice he had engaged, and for the advancement of who&s;e intere&s;t and kingdom in the world he was mo&s;t emi|nently accompli&s;hed. His undi&s;&s;embled piety, the amiablene&s;s of his temper, his mode&s;ty, innocence and innoffen&s;ivene&s;s, which appeared through the whole of his life and conver&s;ation, endeared him to peo|ple of all characters. The young, to whom his death is a &s;triking monitor, and a mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible illu&s;tration of this humbling truth, that every man at his be&s;t e&s;tate is altogether vanity, may from hence be convinced that early piety has it's attractive charms, and that the only way to la&s;ting fame and im|mortal glory is through the temple of vir|tue.
