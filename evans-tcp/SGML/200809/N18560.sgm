<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>I CORINTHIANS, III. 11.</BIBL>
<P>FOR OTHER FOUNDATION CAN NO MAN LAY, THAN THAT IS LAID, WHICH IS JESUS CHRIST.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>EVERY man, who has any &s;en&s;e of the value of his &s;oul, and any regard to its eternal inte|re&s;t, mu&s;t be convinced of the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ome &s;ure and certain foundation, for peace, comfort, and hope, with re&s;pect to his future &s;tate: The &s;oul is &s;o precious, that nothing can be a proper founda|tion for hope concerning its &s;alvation, but one that is firm and &s;tedfa&s;t, one that is laid by GOD him|&s;elf, one that will endure the &s;evere&s;t trials, and that will &s;tand when every thing el&s;e will fall. He is repre&s;ented as a fooli&s;h man, who built his hou&s;e on the &s;and; but he is called wi&s;e, who built upon the Rock, and that Rock is CHRIST.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o a matter of great importance, that Chri&s;|tians &s;hould learn to di&s;tingui&s;h between the true ground of hope, and every thing el&s;e which has any connexion with it, or dependence upon it: For want of this, many a true Chri&s;tian has been &s;ubject to great unea&s;ine&s;s of mind, and has deprived him|&s;elf of much comfort, which he might have enjoyed,
<PB N="4" REF="024089_0004_0FC331E7C94C6AB8">
if he had had a clear and di&s;tinct idea of what he ought &s;olely to build upon. We are very apt to mi&s;take the <HI>evidences</HI> of our intere&s;t in CHRIST, for the <HI>foundation</HI> of our hope; and becau&s;e we &s;ee much imperfection in the evidences, we are apt to think there is imperfection in the foundation: Whereas the foundation is perfect, while the &s;uper&s;tructure is very defective; and by a due attention to this di&s;|tinction, we might enjoy great comfort and peace of mind, even when our evidences are very dark and perplexed.</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle in our context, compares Chri&s;tians to a building, "YE are GOD's building," the foundation of which is JESUS CHRIST. "Every man" is building on this foundation; but the Apo&s;|tle's direction is, "Let every man take heed <HI>how</HI> he builds thereon." The foundation is the mo&s;t im|portant part: There is but one, and no man can lay another, that will &s;tand. When he has begun on the true foundation, then let him take heed how he builds; for there are precious and vile materials, which, imperfect as we are, we are very apt to blend together. There are "gold, &s;ilver and precious &s;tones," by which are meant divine truths in the heart, forming the graces and virtues of the Chri&s;tian character, the genuine fruits of faith and acts of obe|dience to the go&s;pel. And there are "wood, hay and &s;tubble," by which are meant fal&s;e notions, mi&s;|guided zeal, and erroneous conduct in religion, &s;u|per&s;tition, enthu&s;ia&s;m and human infirmity. The&s;e things are too often mixed with the genuine fruits of religion, even in tho&s;e whom we have rea&s;on to hope are true Chri&s;tians. But there is a day coming when "every man's work will be tried as with fire," then the&s;e imperfect and corrupt mixtures will be
<PB N="5" REF="024089_0005_0FC331EB4FA48C10">
burnt, and the man who had them will &s;uffer lo&s;s, a lo&s;s however which he will have no rea&s;on to regret; becau&s;e he him&s;elf &s;hall be &s;aved, yet &s;o as by fire, i. e. as "a brand plucked out of the burning." But if any man's work &s;hall abide the trial, he &s;hall re|ceive a reward, from that impartial and all-penetra|ting Judge, who "&s;hall try every man's work of what &s;ort it is." This I take to be the meaning of the Apo&s;tle in our text and context.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This interpretation was deduced from a view of the context, without con|&s;ulting any commentators. Upon looking into &s;ome of them &s;ince, I find, that though they allow good and bad <HI>works</HI> to be implied, yet they rather under&s;tand good and bad <HI>doctrines</HI> to be intended, by the figures u&s;ed in the 12th ver&s;e; and by the builders, they &s;uppo&s;e are meant public teachers (vid. Pol. Synop&s;.).</P>
<P>This method of interpreting the pa&s;&s;age appears to me too much re&s;trained in it&s;elf, and foreign to the Apo&s;tle's purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I &s;ee no rea&s;on why "every man" who is &s;aid to be building on the founda|tion, &s;hould be re&s;tricted to public teachers; &s;ince, every man mu&s;t contribute to his own edification, and thereby to the edification of the church; and Chri&s;tians are exhorted to "build up <HI>them&s;elves</HI> in their mo&s;t holy faith." Teaching is un|doubtedly &s;ub&s;ervient to this end, but practice much more &s;o; and the practice of Chri&s;tianity is "every man's" duty.</P>
<P>Nor can I &s;ee why good and bad doctrines &s;hould be meant by the metaphors in the 12th ver&s;e, <HI>rather</HI> than good and bad works; &s;ince, the goodne&s;s or badne&s;s of any doctrine is to be e&s;timated by its tendency to produce good or bad fruits in them that hear and believe it. The truths of the Go&s;pel naturally tend to pro|duce faith and holine&s;s, and fal&s;e doctrines lead to fal&s;e dependence and erro|neous conduct.</P>
<P>The de&s;ign of the Apo&s;tle appears to be to reprehend, not fal&s;e teaching, but fal&s;e practice. He is reproving the Corinthians for their "<HI>envying, &s;trife and di|vi&s;ions,</HI>" v. 3. Although he had
<Q>determined to know nothing among them, but JESUS CHRIST, and him crucified,</Q>
and had laid this for the founda|tion; yet they were building on the foundation, with tho&s;e corrupt materials, in&s;tead of the oppo&s;ite graces of <HI>love, unity</HI> and <HI>peace,</HI> to which he had exhorted them (chap. i. 10). He therefore &s;ets before them the folly and unprofitablene&s;s of their conduct, by telling them, that when their work &s;hall come to be tried by fire. i. e. by the exact and impartial di&s;cernment of Him,
<Q>who&s;e eyes are like a flame of fire,</Q>
that corrupt part of it &s;hall be burnt up, whil&s;t only that which is pure &s;hall abide and be rewarded. But he does not give the lea&s;t hint that tho&s;e corrupt works were produced in them by fal&s;e teaching; on the contrary, he &s;peaks with a becoming re&s;pect of Apollos and Cephas, who had been their teach|ers, after him&s;elf, and a&s;cribes the "envying, &s;trife and divi&s;ions" which were among them, to their own carnal di&s;po&s;ition; i. e. to the power of unmortified lu&s;ts, and to their not being fully brought off from their former
<Q>vain conver|&s;ation;</Q>
they were "yet carnal, and walked as men."</P>
<P>By a parity of rea&s;oning, all impure and corrupt mixtures, either in the under|&s;tanding, heart, or life of believers, which tend to keep them imperfect in know|ledge, love and obedience, may be reckoned as "wood, hay and &s;tubble," in the &s;piritual building, which will be de&s;troyed; and on the contrary, all tho&s;e im|provements in divine knowledge, love and holine&s;s, which are the genuine fruits of the Holy Spirit's operation, and their own concurrent endeavours, may be un|der&s;tood by the "gold, &s;ilver and precious &s;tones," which &s;hall abide the deci&s;ive trial, and &s;hall remain and increa&s;e forever</P></NOTE> He would
<PB N="6" REF="024089_0006_0FC331EF2E762A40">
have us take heed that we build on the true founda|tion, for God has laid but one, and no man can lay another. Yet as it is too evident that many per&s;ons, and &s;ome who call them&s;elves Chri&s;tians, are either building on an imperfect foundation, or el&s;e mi&s;|taking the foundation, for &s;ome part of the &s;uper|&s;tructure; I &s;hall endeavour, in di&s;cour&s;ing on this &s;ubject,</P>
<P N="1">I. To &s;hew that JESUS CHRIST is the only Foundation, on which we can build with &s;afety.</P>
<P N="2">II. To point out the weakne&s;s and in&s;ufficiency of other things which we may mi&s;take for the Foundation.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I am to &s;hew, that JESUS CHRIST is the only Foundation, on which we can build with &s;afety.</P>
<P>The Chri&s;tian life is here compared to a building rai&s;ed on a foundation; to a building not yet fini&s;h|ed, but which is growing up by degrees, to an holy temple in the Lord. A foundation is in its nature fixed and immoveable, compo&s;ed of the firme&s;t ma|terials, laid with great care and &s;trength, &s;o as to bear the &s;tructure, without any danger of its falling or &s;inking. Such a foundation is CHRIST, as he is de|&s;cribed by the Prophet;
<Q>Behold I lay in Zion for a foundation, a &s;tone, a tried &s;tone, a precious cor|ner-&s;tone, a &s;ure foundation.</Q>
(I&s;a. xxviii. 16.) When he is &s;aid to be a foundation, the meaning is, that on his account alone, we can hope for pardon and eternal life: And this will appear if we con&s;ider the dignity of his per&s;on, the depth of his humilia|tion, and the glorious te&s;timony of God to the per|fection of his work.</P>
<P>The dignity of his Per&s;on con&s;i&s;ted in his being the Son of God. The name whereby he is called is
<PB N="7" REF="024089_0007_0FC331F2E9611038">
"Wonderful," &s;o wonderful, that as he him&s;elf tells us, "No man knoweth the Son but the Father." The Apo&s;tle Paul, who had the mo&s;t elevated and comprehen&s;ive idea of the divine nature and govern|ment that any mortal ever had, has informed us, that by this glorious Per&s;on, whom he &s;tiles
<Q>the image of the invi&s;ible GOD, the fir&s;t born of every crea|ture, were all things created, which are in heaven, and which are in earth, vi&s;ible and invi&s;ible;</Q>
the Angels in their various ranks and orders, which he thus reckons up,
<Q>Thrones, Dominions, Principali|ties and Powers;</Q>
and not only that all things were created by him, but <HI>for</HI> him, and for this rea&s;on he is &s;tiled "the heir of all things," and "Lord of all." The whole creation being his own work, is his own property, and inheritance. No change or revolution could come to pa&s;s in his creation, without &s;erving in &s;ome way to manife&s;t his glory. Among the creatures which he endowed with rational powers and freedom of will, &s;ome of the &s;uperior order, abu&s;ing their natural liberty,
<Q>kept not their fir&s;t e&s;tate, but left their own habitation, and are re&s;erved in ever|la&s;ting chains, under darkne&s;s, to the judgment of the great day.</Q>
This is all which is revealed to us, concerning the defection, or revolt of tho&s;e &s;upe|rior beings; and perhaps we &s;hould never have been made acquainted with &s;o much as this, if there had not been &s;ome connexion between that event, and our own apo&s;tacy. For the prince of tho&s;e fallen &s;pirits was the in&s;trument of &s;preading ruin and mi|&s;ery in this world: He &s;educed our fir&s;t parents to join him in rebellion again&s;t their Maker; and thus brought mankind into a &s;tate of &s;in.</P>
<P>To recover from ruin, that part of his creation which had been thus &s;educed, the glorious Son of
<PB N="8" REF="024089_0008_0FC331F452DC6E20">
God was plea&s;ed to become a Mediator, with his Fa|ther. Divine ju&s;tice required that the guilty &s;hould be puni&s;hed; but the mercy and compa&s;&s;ion of our Emmanuel, led him to undertake the work of our redemption, by making him&s;elf a &s;acrifice for us. And becau&s;e it was impo&s;&s;ible that he &s;hould perform this work, in his pre-exi&s;tent &s;tate; becau&s;e it was impo&s;&s;ible that he &s;hould &s;uffer death, without a body to &s;uffer in; therefore God his Father prepared him a body, in the womb of a virgin, which body was "the &s;eed of Abraham."</P>
<P>We are then to con&s;ider that glorious and exalted Being, who "was in the form of GOD," who was "in the beginning with GOD," and "was GOD"; who&s;e comprehen&s;ive powers were equal to the crea|tion and government of the heavens and earth, re|duced to the condition of an human infant, one of the mo&s;t weak and helple&s;s beings in the world; all tho&s;e va&s;t and amazing faculties which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in the days of eternity, inclo&s;ed within the &s;canty limits of an infant mind, to be opened and unfolded by de|grees. He who
<Q>was made better than the angels, and obtained by inheritance a more excellent name than they,</Q>
was "made lower than the angels." He who was that wi&s;dom which
<Q>the Lord po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in the beginning of his way,</Q>
was reduced to &s;uch a &s;tate as to grow in wi&s;dom as he grew in &s;tature. He who was Lord and Governor of heaven and earth, became &s;ubject to Jo&s;eph and Mary, and lived in &s;trict obedience to their commands. He "in whom were hid all the trea&s;ures of wi&s;dom and knowledge," conde&s;cended to &s;it in the mid&s;t of the Jewi&s;h doctors, a&s;king them que&s;tions, and hearing with attention their an&s;wers. He who was Lord of the angels, and again&s;t whom &s;ome of them rebelled, was be&s;et with
<PB N="9" REF="024089_0009_0FC331FB174FF4E0">
the temptations of that &s;oul &s;pirit, the leader of their rebellion, was vexed with his impudent &s;ugge&s;tions, and carried about by him from place to place, that he might be tempted in a variety of ways, and that the temptations might have the greate&s;t force. He who was King of kings, and Lord of lords, put on the form of a &s;ervant. He who was happy in the joys of eternity, conde&s;cended to wearine&s;s, hunger and thir&s;t, grief and di&s;tre&s;s of mind. He who knew the heart of man, was betrayed by a fal&s;e friend. He who had "all power in heaven and earth," and was able to "rule in the mid&s;t of his enemies," was carried before the tribunal of an hypocritical high-prie&s;t, and the judgment-&s;eat of a time-&s;erving governor. He who is "the faithful witne&s;s," was fal&s;ely accu&s;ed, and
<Q>the Judge of all</Q>
was unju&s;tly condemned.
<Q>The Prince of Life</Q>
was hanged on a tree, and gave him&s;elf up to Death. His holy &s;oul was penetrated with a mo&s;t deep and affecting &s;en&s;e of the honor of his Father's law, the dignity of his character, the rectitude of his government, the ju&s;tice and nece&s;&s;ity of tho&s;e &s;uffer|ings which he was entering upon, and at the &s;ame time filled with the mo&s;t tender love and compa&s;&s;ion to mankind. Whil&s;t all the&s;e views were pre&s;ent in his mind, and whil&s;t at the &s;ame time he reflected on the eternal love of God to him,
<Q>the glory which he had with him before the foundation of the world,</Q>
and the un&s;peakable happine&s;s he had enjoyed
<Q>in the bo&s;om of the Father, rejoicing always before him,</Q>
he had now the gloomy pro&s;pect of being "cut off," and "made a cur&s;e:" and can we wonder, that, with the&s;e views and pro&s;pects in his mind, he &s;hould pray the Father to
<Q>glorify him again, with that glory which he had with him before the world was?</Q>
This prayer was made in full faith and confidence; and we are a&s;&s;ured, that "he was heard in that he feared."</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="024089_0010_0FC331FD6D109F00">God was plea&s;ed to give the mo&s;t public, &s;olemn te&s;timony to the perfection of his righteou&s;ne&s;s, and the acceptance of his &s;acrifice, by rai&s;ing him from the dead, and exalting him to his own right hand in the heavenly places. Being thus
<Q>made perfect through &s;uffering, he is become the author of eternal &s;alva|tion to them that obey him.</Q>
Upon this foundation, namely, the once offered &s;acrifice of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, God is reconciling the world to him&s;elf. Upon this foundation the Church is built. "Chri&s;t is the &s;tone which the Jewi&s;h builders rejected, and which is now become the head of the corner; neither is there &s;alva|tion in any other, for there is no other name given under heaven, among men, whereby we mu&s;t be &s;aved.</P>
<P>I now proceed to the &s;econd thing propo&s;ed, viz.</P>
<P N="2">II. To point out the weakne&s;s and in&s;ufficiency of other things, which we may mi&s;take for our foun|dation.</P>
<P N="1">1. There are &s;ome who build their religion only on the foundation of <HI>nature;</HI> on the natural notions which they have of God, his attributes and works. They have learnt that there is a God, that he is infi|nitely wi&s;e, holy, ju&s;t and good; and from the&s;e cha|racters of God, they infer the duties of reverence, love, and obedience to the dictates of that law which he has written on the heart. The&s;e primary truths and duties of religion are all contained in the Go&s;pel, and make an e&s;&s;ential part of it; but this foundation is defective, becau&s;e it admits not of a Mediator. It will do for innocent, but not for &s;inful creatures. This foundation is defective, becau&s;e it has no &s;acrifice for &s;in, and con&s;equently no promi&s;e of forgivene&s;s. The religion of nature will teach us a great part of our duty; but it will not &s;hew us how we can be ac|cepted
<PB N="11" REF="024089_0011_0FC33209427EF250">
of God, when we are pre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e of guilt; it cannot take that burden off from the con|&s;cience, and give us hope toward God, when we view our&s;elves as &s;inners in his &s;ight. This foundation alone, therefore, will not do for &s;inful creatures to build upon, e&s;pecially for tho&s;e who have a better re|vealed to them. If they neglect the true foundation, which God has revealed in the &s;criptures, and build only on this, they &s;hew that they
<Q>love darkne&s;s rather than light.</Q></P>
<P>Whatever knowledge of God may be deduced from the works of nature and providence, yet it is certain, that by Je&s;us Chri&s;t there is the mo&s;t full and glorious di&s;covery made of the divine perfections.
<Q>In him dwelt <HI>all the fulne&s;s</HI> of the Godhead, bodily;</Q>
&s;o that they who &s;aw him, &s;aw the Father who dwelt in him. God did "in very deed dwell with man," though
<Q>the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain him.</Q>
"God was manife&s;ted in the fle&s;h," and di&s;played his glorious perfections in human nature; yet in &s;uch a mild, ea&s;y and familiar view, as to at|tract the love, as well as veneration of tho&s;e who "beheld his glory." And by the revelation of God in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, we are led to &s;uch a knowledge of him, as will be the eternal life of our &s;ouls; a know|ledge which is begun here, and will be increa&s;ing through eternity. Let the Dei&s;t then boa&s;t of his natural knowledge of God, and throw the Mediator out of his religion; the Chri&s;tian will believe, that
<Q>there is ONE God, and ONE Mediator between God and man, the man Chri&s;t Je&s;us;</Q>
and in this Me|diator, he will &s;ee more of God, and be more happy in his acquaintance with him, than the mo&s;t enlight|ened Dei&s;t can without him.</P>
<P N="2">2. An <HI>outward profe&s;&s;ion</HI> &s;tands, for &s;ome people,
<PB N="12" REF="024089_0012_0FC3320DC46722E0">
in&s;tead of a foundation. They flatter them&s;elves, that becau&s;e they have been baptized into the name of Chri&s;t, or becau&s;e they have entered into the number of vi&s;ible Chri&s;tians, or becau&s;e they are regular in their attendance on the public wor&s;hip and ordi|nances, therefore it will be well with them hereafter. There are not many who will own this; for they would be a&s;hamed to have it known, that they have no better foundation; but yet they vainly pre&s;ume, in their hearts, that the re&s;pect, which they outwardly &s;hew to religion, will commend them to God, as wor|thy objects of his &s;avour: They think them&s;elves the friends of Chri&s;t, becau&s;e they eat and drink in his pre&s;ence, and call him Lord, Lord, and appear among his di&s;ciples. Such a conduct as this, is as ab|&s;urd, as if we &s;hould mi&s;take the outward covering and ornaments of a building for the foundation. An outward profe&s;&s;ion, an attendance on religious wor|&s;hip and ordinances, are but the ornamental part of the chri&s;tian character; they are indeed duties be|coming a Chri&s;tian, for it is our duty to be, and to appear to be, the di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t; but if we have no real religion within, to what purpo&s;e do we put on the appearance of it? Why do we attempt to de|ceive men, when God knows our heart? What will it avail to plead, that we have eaten and drunken in the pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t, when he &s;hall &s;ay,
<Q>I know you not, depart from me, ye that work iniquity?</Q></P>
<P N="3">3. Some people build their religion on a <HI>partial view of Chri&s;t, as a redeemer.</HI> They believe that he died to redeem us from the puni&s;hment of &s;in in the future world; but they have no idea of being re|deemed from the power of &s;in in this world: They will readily tru&s;t in him as a &s;aviour from the wrath of God, but they are not willing to &s;ubmit to him as
<PB N="13" REF="024089_0013_0FC332190BE9ED40">
a King and Lord, and bow their necks to his yoke: They would be glad to be &s;aved by him, but they are not willing to be ruled by him: They entertain very high thoughts of the mercy of God towards &s;in|ners, and the merits of Chri&s;t's blood, to deliver them from de&s;truction; but they have no regard to the duty which God requires of them; no readine&s;s to the work of mortification and &s;elf-denial; no di&s;|po&s;ition to do any thing in religion, but to entertain a blind hope, and a dead faith in Chri&s;t, as a partial redeemer. They may think they are building on the true foundation, becau&s;e they are in raptures with Chri&s;t and free grace; but it is a Chri&s;t of their own making, and not the Chri&s;t of God; it is grace of their own devi&s;ing, and not the grace of the Go&s;pel; for
<Q>the grace of God, which bringeth &s;alvation, teacheth us, that denying ungodline&s;s and worldly lu&s;ts, we &s;hould live &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly and godlily in the world;</Q>

<Q>gave him&s;elf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto him&s;elf a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</Q>
Tho&s;e therefore who pretend to build on Chri&s;t, and yet have no de&s;ire to be redeemed from iniquity, no de&s;ire to deny them|&s;elves, to take up their cro&s;s and follow him; no de&s;ire to live &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly and godlily in the world; whatever high notions they may entertain of Chri&s;t and free grace, are yet &s;trangers to the true foundation of chri&s;tian hope.</P>

There are others who go on the contrary ex|treme, and fancy that they &s;hall be &s;aved becau&s;e of their <HI>good works,</HI> without any ju&s;t regard to the perfect obedience of the Mediator.

The&s;e are all good works, good in them&s;elves, for they are com|manded duties, and have a tendency to do good, and God forbid that any man &s;hould, by any means, be di&s;couraged from the performance of them. But then we &s;hould remember, that the&s;e are not the foun|dation on which we are to build; they ought rather to be accounted a part of the &s;uper&s;tructure. Good works are proper materials in the &s;piritual building, but they &s;hould be put in their proper place, and not laid as the foundation of our hope of eternal life. They are, when rightly performed, fruits and evidences of our faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and our regard to his authority; but they are not the ground of our hope, becau&s;e they are imperfect. If we would be ju&s;tified by <HI>our</HI> obe|dience, it mu&s;t be perfect. None but a perfect righ|teou&s;ne&s;s can be allowed or accepted by God, as a ground of ju&s;tification in the eye of his law; and where is the man who dare look the law of God in the face, and &s;ay, "<HI>I am righteous?</HI>" If there be any defect in our obedience, be it ever &s;o &s;mall, that de|fect will mar the whole. "<HI>If we keep the whole law, and offend in one point, we are guilty of all.</HI>" But how often does it happen, that they who expect to be &s;a|ved by their works, and who glory in their ob&s;ervance of &s;ome of the rules of morality, are as remarkably deficient in others? Are there not &s;ome, who are &s;crupulous in their dealings, exact to their promi&s;es and the payment of their debts, yet are given to pa&s;|&s;ionate and profane language, or the lu&s;t of unclean|ne&s;s? Are there not &s;ome who are nice in their ob|&s;ervation of the Sabbath, and the forms of devotion, and yet will make no &s;cruple to &s;lander their neigh|bours,

Few people are entirely con&s;i&s;tent and uniform in their re|gard to the duties of morality; and if they make their foundation of &s;uch imperfect, ill-joined materials as the&s;e, they have but a poor bottom to &s;tand upon, and their building will fall into ruin.</P>
<P>As Chri&s;t is the true foundation of our hope to|ward God, &s;o he is the foundation of all that moral|ity, and tho&s;e good works, which will be accepted and rewarded at the la&s;t day. We are commanded to do all that we do,
<Q>in the name of Chri&s;t, and to the glory of God by him;</Q>
and if it be &s;o done, it will be accepted and rewarded for his &s;ake. The grace of God will accept and reward the obedience of believ|ers, for the &s;ake of Him who has

<P N="5">5. Some people are very fond of building upon their <HI>experiences.</HI> They think they have experienced &s;uch things, in the cour&s;e of their pa&s;t lives, as de|nominate them the favourites of heaven, and they have great confidence ari&s;ing from &s;uch a per&s;ua&s;ion. But, if what they have experienced is fal&s;e and delu|&s;ive,
<PB N="16" REF="024089_0016_0FC332251B0E5C70">
their confidence is in the highe&s;t degree dan|gerous; and, if their experiences are ever &s;o real and well-grounded, yet they mu&s;t be carefully di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from the foundation, for they are no part of it, but are rather a part of the &s;uper&s;tructure which is built upon it. And here I &s;hall be more large and particular, becau&s;e this is a very e&s;&s;ential part of Chri&s;tian knowledge; and an exact attention to it will greatly tend to remove difficulties, and clear up ob&s;curities, with which many good people are troubled.</P>
<P>By fal&s;e experiences, I mean tho&s;e exerci&s;es of the mind, which exi&s;t only in the imagination or pa&s;&s;ions, and never truly affect the heart, or have a right in|fluence on the moral conduct. Such, for in&s;tance, is the plea&s;ure which we feel in hearing &s;ome particular &s;orts of preaching; where, the mere force and energy of the &s;peaker's voice, the gracefulne&s;s of his oratory, or the &s;moothne&s;s of his periods, give a plea&s;ing mo|tion to the animal &s;pirits. Or, tho&s;e workings of the pa&s;&s;ions, either of admiration, fear, grief, joy or pity, which are excited by an attention to the word preached, and which go off as &s;oon as the &s;ound is out of our ears. Or, tho&s;e may be termed fal&s;e ex|periences, which con&s;i&s;t in the lively working of the fancy, either &s;leeping or waking; &s;uch as &s;eeing &s;ights, hearing voices, feeling impul&s;es and impre&s;&s;ions, which we do not know how to account for, and &s;o imagine them to be from the Spirit of God. When a per&s;on for&s;akes the Word of God, as his rule, and gives him|&s;elf up to the wild wanderings of his imagination, under a notion that he is immediately dictated to by the Spirit of God, he is in a fair way to run into all manner of confu&s;ion and error, both of principle and conduct. Or, we may call tho&s;e fal&s;e experiences,
<PB N="17" REF="024089_0017_0FC33226DFC64318">
which are grounded on the &s;udden impre&s;&s;ions of texts of &s;cripture on the mind, without any regard to the meaning and de&s;ign of the &s;acred writers. Truth may indeed be brought to the mind in this way by the Spirit of God, and he may u&s;e the words of &s;crip|ture, which are his own words, to convey truth to the mind; but before we can determine whether &s;uch impre&s;&s;ions are from him or not, we &s;hould con&s;ult the &s;criptures, and be &s;ure that we under&s;tand tho&s;e texts, which are &s;o impre&s;&s;ed, according to their ju&s;t &s;en&s;e and meaning; for we know that the devil him|&s;elf has quoted &s;cripture, by &s;craps and pieces, to fa|vour his temptations; as he did to Chri&s;t, when he would have had him ca&s;t him&s;elf down from the pin|nacle of the temple. And we &s;hould always be &s;ure that we pay more regard to <HI>the truth it&s;elf,</HI> than to the &s;udden and extraordinary manner of its coming into our mind. If we have a regard to the truths and commands of God's word, it is of no great impor+tance, whether they come into our mind by reading, by hearing, by recollection, or by &s;udden impre&s;&s;ion: But if we regard &s;udden impre&s;&s;ions, though made in the very words of &s;cripture, as a &s;ign of the di&s;tin|gui&s;hing favour of God toward us, and make u&s;e of them, to uphold a notion that we are admitted to more intimate communion with him, than other per|&s;ons, who take pains to &s;earch the &s;cripture, and ac|quire their knowledge more &s;lowly and regularly, we have a &s;ad proof of the blinding power of &s;piritual pride and pre&s;umption. In &s;hort, all tho&s;e workings of the imagination, all tho&s;e flights of pa&s;&s;ion, all tho&s;e impul&s;es and impre&s;&s;ions, which tend to rai&s;e our opinion of our&s;elves, as if we were higher in the favour of God than others; to make us look with contempt on tho&s;e whom we imagine to be not ad|mitted

to &s;uch familiarity with our Maker; to make us tru&s;t in our own attainments, and neglect the in|&s;tituted means of divine knowledge; all &s;uch things, call them experiences, manife&s;tations, or what you will, are vain and deceitful, and as worthle&s;s in them|&s;elves as the righteou&s;ne&s;s which Paul had before his conver&s;ion, and which he accounted but "as dung," when he came to know the grace of God in truth.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The reader may &s;ee this point largely di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, with great preci&s;ion and pen|etration, in the late Pre&s;ident Edwards's Treati&s;e of Religious Affections.</NOTE></P>
<P>But there is another kind of experiences, which are real and well-grounded, and yet are to be di&s;tingui&s;h|ed from the foundation of the Chri&s;tian's hope. For in&s;tance, every one, who is acquainted with the re|ligion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, has had experience of the wick|edne&s;s of his own heart; he is convinced, by expe|rience, that there is in him no good thing; he has &s;een that his &s;ins have &s;eparated between God and him, and that it is not in his power to remove the guilt of them, or &s;ecure the favour and mercy of God toward him. How ab&s;urd would it be to rely on &s;uch an experience as this, for the foundation of his hope? Is not the natural tendency of it to take him off from all &s;elf-dependence, and lead him to Chri&s;t, in whom alone he can find that righteou&s;ne&s;s, on which he may &s;afely build his hope of pardon and life? And indeed this is the true nature and ten|dency of all gracious and &s;piritual experiences, to &s;hew us our own emptine&s;s and in&s;ufficiency, and to make us prize and value Chri&s;t above all things. But our experience of the worthine&s;s and excellency of Chri&s;t, and of his &s;uitablene&s;s to be our &s;aviour, is not the rea&s;on of his being &s;o; he is &s;o, whether we experience it or not; he is altogether lovely in him|&s;elf, whether we perceive his beauty and loveline&s;s or
<PB N="19" REF="024089_0019_0FC33229E39E6C68">
not; he is infinitely worthy in him&s;elf, or we could not perceive him to be &s;o; he has "all fulne&s;s" dwelling in him, or we could not
<Q>receive of his ful|ne&s;s:</Q>
There is an e&s;&s;ential glory, dignity and loveline&s;s in his character, and a &s;uitablene&s;s in him to be our &s;aviour, which is the ground and rea&s;on of all exerci&s;e of tru&s;t in him, and love to him; and our belief of it unites us to him, and engages us to tru&s;t in him, to love and &s;erve him.</P>
<P>However, the&s;e experiences, though real, &s;piritual, and delightful, yet are liable to great imperfection and interruption; and for this rea&s;on, if there were no other, they are not a &s;uitable foundation for our hope. There is no Chri&s;tian, however highly favour|ed of God with a &s;en&s;e of his love and grace, and with a &s;ight of the glory, excellency and loveline&s;s of Je|&s;us Chri&s;t, but has been forced to experience, on the contrary, the hidings of God's face, and the withdraw of tho&s;e comfortable manife&s;tations of the love of God; e&s;pecially when he has been &s;urprized into &s;ome &s;in, the guilt of which hangs heavy on his &s;oul, and renders him offen&s;ive to an holy God. In &s;uch a circum&s;tance, can it be any ju&s;t ground of con&s;ola|tion to the Chri&s;tian, to reflect upon his pa&s;t experi|ences? Can he patch up a righteou&s;ne&s;s out of them, in which he may appear pure before an heart-&s;earch|ing God? Will old experiences quiet his mind, under a &s;en&s;e of new guilt? Will they purge his con&s;cience from dead works? Rather, will they not &s;erve to ag|gravate his guilt? Will he not be a&s;hamed of his in|gratitude to that God, who has &s;o highly &s;avoured him? Will he not &s;ee that he has violated the &s;tronge&s;t obligations? Will he not be a&s;hamed of his ba&s;ene&s;s and vilene&s;s? And will he have peace or re&s;t in his mind, till he has humbled him&s;elf be|fore
<PB N="20" REF="024089_0020_0FC33233FA1245A0">
God, and begged his pardoning mercy? And on what ground will he a&s;k, or can he look for mercy? Certainly, not from any thing that has heretofore pa&s;&s;ed in his mind; for that which is an aggravation of his offence cannot be the ground of his forgivene&s;s; but he mu&s;t, he will look to the atoning blood of the Lamb of God, &s;hed for him ages before he was born; and thence he will derive all his hope and comfort.</P>
<P>Moreover, &s;uppo&s;ing that a Chri&s;tian may, either by the natural decay of his rational faculties, or the power of a melancholy habit, lo&s;e all &s;en&s;e and re|membrance of his pa&s;t experiences, or be inclined to call in que&s;tion the reality of them; in either of the&s;e ca&s;es, what mu&s;t he do? If experiences are the ground of his hope, his hope is gone, and he mu&s;t abandon him&s;elf to de&s;pair. But God has provided better for us than this. He has provided "&s;trong con&s;olation" for them that fly
<Q>for refuge to lay hold on the hope &s;et before them;</Q>
this refuge is always open; and though a Chri&s;tian has fled to it ever &s;o often, &s;till he may flee to it again. If he &s;hould lo&s;e all comforta|ble &s;en&s;e of having done &s;o before, yet the doors of everla&s;ting mercy are wide open to receive him; and if he comes, "he &s;hall in no wi&s;e be ca&s;t out."
<Q>The foundation of God &s;tandeth &s;ure;</Q>
&s;o &s;ure, that none of the changes, darkne&s;&s;es and perplexities of our minds can remove it.</P>
<P>Chri&s;tian experiences are &s;o far from being the proper foundation of our hope, that though they &s;hould be all lo&s;t to our remembrance, yet the foun|dation of our hope will remain, and we may have recour&s;e to it at all times, as much as we had at fir&s;t, and derive the &s;ame comfort and &s;upport from it. The mo&s;t experienced Chri&s;tian in the world has no better, no other foundation for his hope than he had
<PB N="21" REF="024089_0021_0FC3324024563B18">
the fir&s;t moment he became a believer: He knows there is no other name given under heaven, whereby he can be &s;aved, but the name of Chri&s;t; and though he has had ever &s;o bright and clear evidence of his union to him, and intere&s;t in him, it does not add any thing to the &s;trength of his foundation; it does not add any thing to the virtue and merit of that blood which clean&s;eth from all &s;in, of that atonement which was the original ground of his reconciliation to God: He &s;till looks on him&s;elf as an unworthy &s;inner, and puts his whole tru&s;t in that
<Q>righteou&s;ne&s;s which delivereth from death.</Q>
The re&s;ult of all his ex|periences is to aba&s;e him&s;elf in his own eyes, and to exalt Chri&s;t in his e&s;teem; he finds him exceedingly precious, as the author and fini&s;her of his faith, and through him alone he hopes for acceptance before the pre&s;ence of a righteous God.</P>
<P>We &s;ee then, that experiences are to be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from the foundation; they are no part of it; but rather ari&s;e out of it; and the u&s;e of them is this; they are, in conjunction with acts of obedience, evi|dences of our being built on the true foundation. I &s;ay, in conjunction with acts of obedience, becau&s;e, without obedience to the commands of Chri&s;t, we certainly are not his di&s;ciples; and if our experiences are not accompanied with obedience, they are not true nor genuine; but both together &s;erve to evi|dence, that we are built on the foundation; they are both fruits of the Spirit of Chri&s;t, and
<Q>hereby do we know that we are of the truth, by the &s;pirit which he hath given us.</Q></P>
<P>Let me now a&s;&s;i&s;t you in making &s;ome IMPROVE|MENT of this Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>And, in the fir&s;t place, I would caution you again&s;t making a wrong u&s;e of it. Do not ha&s;tily conclude,
<PB N="22" REF="024089_0022_0FC3324187B17798">
from what you have heard, that all who have not &s;uch clear ideas of the di&s;tinction between the foun|dation and the &s;uper&s;tructure, are building on a wrong foundation. Some very &s;incere Chri&s;tians may have very indi&s;tinct notions of the&s;e things. They know that they mu&s;t believe in Chri&s;t; they know that they mu&s;t obey him, and they know they mu&s;t have an experimental acquaintance with relig|ion, or they cannot be &s;aved: And they are the &s;ub|jects of this faith, and this obedience, and this expe|rimental knowledge, and yet, not being able to di&s;|tingui&s;h between them, they blend them all together as the foundation of their hope, which is thereby greatly interrupted and ob&s;cured. But as our gra|cious Redeemer knows
<Q>how to have compa&s;&s;ion on the ignorant, and &s;uch as are out of the way;</Q>
&s;o we &s;hould exerci&s;e our charity toward all tho&s;e who appear to love and obey the Go&s;pel, though, at the &s;ame time, they appear to be but "babes in Chri&s;t," and "un&s;kilful in the word of righteou&s;ne&s;s."</P>
<P>Secondly, We &s;hould improve this &s;ubject to clear up the doubts and darkne&s;&s;es which Chri&s;tians are often troubled with, for want of attending to this di&s;tinction between the foundation and the &s;uper|&s;tructure.</P>
<P>When Chri&s;tians look within them&s;elves, they &s;ee &s;uch remainders of corruption, &s;uch imperfection in holine&s;s, &s;uch a mixture of &s;in with their be&s;t duties and brighte&s;t enjoyments, that they are ready to que&s;tion their own &s;incerity; they are afraid that they are building on a wrong foundation, and their peace and comfort are greatly interrupted: This makes them drag heavily along, and robs them of that &s;atis|faction which they might enjoy by a direct contempla|tion of the objects of faith and hope. This doubting,
<PB N="23" REF="024089_0023_0FC332430D164010">
he&s;itating frame of mind is very common with Chri&s;|tians on a &s;ick bed, and is much increa&s;ed by the weakne&s;s of their bodies, and the &s;ugge&s;tions of the great adver&s;ary, who loves to vex and di&s;tre&s;s, though it is not in his power to de&s;troy, the &s;heep of Chri&s;t. But if Chri&s;tians would learn to di&s;tingui&s;h between the foundation, and the &s;uper&s;tructure which is rai&s;ed upon it, this would help to remove, or prevent the darkne&s;s they are troubled with. And there is a clear di&s;tinction between them; for the one is perfect, and the other is imperfect; the foundation is the work of God alone, and is therefore ab&s;olutely perfect, un|changeable and immoveable; the other is the joint work of God's Spirit and them&s;elves; and is, as the Apo&s;tle de&s;cribes it in our context, a mixture of gold, &s;ilver and precious &s;tones, with wood, hay and &s;tubble; a mixture of &s;piritual graces and virtues with human errors, weakne&s;&s;es and infirmities. Now if we look among this mixture, we &s;hall find &s;ome things good and valuable, and &s;ome things vile, mean and abominable; but nothing fit to rely upon, nothing that can give us hope and confidence toward God. If we look over our devotional exerci&s;es, we &s;hall find &s;ome degree of &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, of love to God, of confi|dence in Chri&s;t, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the divine will; and therewith we &s;hall find a mixture of pride and vanity, wanderings of heart, carele&s;&s;ne&s;s and formal|ity. If we look over our good works, we &s;hall find &s;ome things ju&s;t and charitable, hone&s;t and of good report; and we &s;hall find a mixture of pa&s;&s;ion, or prejudice, or &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, or vain-glory, among the&s;e. If we look over our experiences, we may recollect &s;ome &s;ea&s;ons of great plea&s;ure and delight in God and the things of religion; we may find that we have, by divine grace, been enabled to re&s;i&s;t and overcome
<PB N="24" REF="024089_0024_0FC33244C2D22EE8">
very &s;trong temptations; that we have enjoyed much light and comfort in the word of God; much &s;upport in affliction, and the like: And on the other hand, we &s;hall find that we have had experience of the de|ceitfulne&s;s of our hearts; too ea&s;y compliance with the alluring vanities of the world; a re&s;tive, repining di&s;po&s;ition of mind, and a want of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to God's will. There is no Chri&s;tian but will find &s;uch a mixture of purity and impurity, &s;in and duty, in his own heart and life. But let him remember, that &s;uch a mixture as this is not the foundation, it is the &s;uper&s;tructure which is built upon it, and which will be tried with fire; the wood, hay and &s;tubble will be burnt up; and all that is worth pre&s;erving, will be pre&s;erved. The foundation is quite a different thing; it is nothing le&s;s than the perfect obedience of the Son of God, the "everla&s;ting righteou&s;ne&s;s" which he hath "brought in" for the ju&s;tification of the guilty: This is a thing which cannot be moved or &s;haken by any changes that pa&s;s in our minds; if our devotion, our obedience, our experience be ever &s;o imperfect, yet the foundation of God is perfect; the everla&s;ting righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Redeemer is as firm as the throne of God; the anchor of our hope is
<Q>within the vail, whither the Fore-runner is entered, having obtained eternal redemption for us.</Q>
Here then mu&s;t we look for hope and comfort; here is the "&s;trong con&s;olation" which God has provided for the heirs of &s;alvation: Behold the Lamb of God! turn your eyes off from your&s;elves, and look to Je&s;us, whom your &s;ins have pierced! Behold him giving his life a ran&s;om for you! Behold him ri&s;ing, and re|a&s;&s;uming that life which he laid down, carrying hu|man nature to heaven, and &s;eating it on the right hand of God! and behold him there, making con|tinual

interce&s;&s;ion for you! Draw your comfort from this &s;ource, and you need not fear drawing too much; there is enough to &s;atisfy the mo&s;t enlarged de&s;ires of your immortal &s;ouls. Let not a &s;en&s;e of your un|worthine&s;s hinder you from enjoying this rich con|&s;olation; for it is intended only for tho&s;e who know them&s;elves utterly unworthy; they only can receive it with a true reli&s;h; Go&s;pel ble&s;&s;ings are not bought and &s;old, they are freely given, and freely received, "without money and without price." Behold the grace of the giver, and e&s;teem the gift for its worth and preciou&s;ne&s;s; take the comfort which it con|tains, and which is de&s;igned for you, and keep not your&s;elves in doubt and darkne&s;s. If you look with|in your&s;elves ever &s;o long, ever &s;o critically, you will find nothing there to be any foundation for comfort; you will there &s;ee enough to be a ground of condem|nation and de&s;pair; but if you look to Chri&s;t, you will &s;ee enough in him to give you hope and confi|dence toward God.</P>
<P>I doubt not there are many true Chri&s;tians who are often perplexed with doubts and darkne&s;s about their &s;piritual &s;tate, becau&s;e they &s;ee &s;o much wickedne&s;s and imperfection in them&s;elves; and yet, whenever they can happily get di&s;engaged from them&s;elves, and turn their eyes toward their Redeemer, can rejoice and delight in him, are perfectly &s;atisfied with the plan of divine grace, and the method of &s;alvation; and though they
<Q>walk in darkne&s;s, and &s;ee no light, can tru&s;t in the name of the Lord, and &s;tay them&s;elves on their God;</Q>
and thus prove that they are built on the true foundation. The be&s;t way, therefore, to get rid of doubts and darkne&s;s, fears and &s;cruples, is to go di|rectly to the foundation, and begin again, ju&s;t as if we had never done any thing before, as if we were but

ju&s;t &s;etting out in religion; and we &s;hall then find the &s;ame comfort, ari&s;ing from a view of Chri&s;t and his redemption, as we did at fir&s;t; and as often as we get involved in darkne&s;s, do the &s;ame;
<Q>forget the things that are behind,</Q>
leave the wood, hay and &s;tubble to be burnt up, and take our comfort from the founda|tion, which is always fixed and immoveable.</P>
<P>Thirdly, What has been &s;aid may al&s;o be improved for the detection of hypocri&s;y. I do not mean, that we &s;hould detect the hypocri&s;y of one another, but of our&s;elves. Thus, we &s;hould examine what it is that we are building upon. Are we building on our out|ward profe&s;&s;ion of religion, our regular &s;tanding in the church, on the &s;uppo&s;ed goodne&s;s of our moral cha|racters, or our pa&s;t experiences? if &s;o, then we are mi&s;taking our foundation; and the &s;ooner we di&s;cover our mi&s;take, the better it will be for us. Let me a&s;&s;i&s;t you a little in this &s;elf-examination.</P>
<P>Are you regular in your profe&s;&s;ion of religion and attendance on the means of in&s;truction? Very well, this is your duty. Do you do it from a regard to Chri&s;t, and becau&s;e he would have all his di&s;ciples make an open profe&s;&s;ion of their relation to him? Do you do it to &s;hew that you are not a&s;hamed of a cruci|fied Saviour, even in the mid&s;t of a crooked, perver&s;e and &s;coffing generation? This is a duty you owe to Him, who hath redeemed you by his blood, who re|quires you to confe&s;s him before men, and has pro|mi&s;ed to confe&s;s you before his Father and his angels. But if you are proud of your profe&s;&s;ion; if you look upon your&s;elves as &s;uperior to other per&s;ons who make not &s;uch a profe&s;&s;ion; if you de&s;pi&s;e them as per&s;ons who do not &s;tand in &s;o near a relation to God as you; if you are ready to &s;ay,
<Q>God, I thank thee that I am not as other men, nor as this publican,</Q>
<PB N="27" REF="024089_0027_0FC3325807414108">
then your &s;acrifice is &s;o tainted with pride, your pro|fe&s;&s;ion is &s;uch a bubble, and your heart is &s;o rotten and deceitful, that God will look on you with the &s;ame contempt as you do on others; for he looks not at the outward appearance, but at the heart.</P>
<P>Again, Are you punctual and exact in the perform|ance of moral duties? Do you deal ju&s;tly with all men, and &s;hew mercy to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed? This is doing well. But are you con&s;i&s;tent with your&s;elves in what you do? Have you regard to <HI>all</HI> God's commands? Do you perform &s;ecret duties? Do you pray to your Fa|ther who &s;ees in &s;ecret? Do you give your alms &s;o that your left hand knows not what your right hand does? Do you mortify &s;ecret lu&s;ts? Do you watch and guard again&s;t &s;ecret temptations? Do you aim to be &s;piritually minded? And do you do all this in a firm reliance on the grace of Chri&s;t, and the aid of his Spirit, de&s;iring to approve your&s;elves faithful in the &s;ight of Him who &s;earches the heart? The&s;e are &s;igns that you are building on the true foundation; your morality is of the nature of gold, &s;ilver and pre|cious &s;tones, which will abide the devouring fire; and though you may have &s;ome mixture of wood, hay and &s;tubble, yet that will be burnt up, and you will be &s;aved. But if your morality is only outward; if you do works of ju&s;tice or charity to be &s;een of men; if whil&s;t your out&s;ide is fair, your hearts are impure; if you do not &s;truggle with &s;ecret lu&s;ts; if you are not uniform and con&s;i&s;tent in your obedience; if you perform one duty becau&s;e it is convenient, or becau&s;e it will get you a good name, and neglect another be|cau&s;e there is no outward advantage attending it; then your morality is but
<Q>a &s;ounding bra&s;s and a tinkling cymbal;</Q>
it may indeed be of &s;ome benefit to mankind, and to your&s;elf too, in outward re&s;pects;
<PB N="28" REF="024089_0028_0FC3326286D7C138">
it may be be&s;t for the world and for your temporal intere&s;t, but you have but a very poor foundation to expect, that "our God, who is a con&s;uming fire," will accept or reward it, in that day,
<Q>when the fire &s;hall try every man's work, of what &s;ort it is.</Q></P>
<P>Again, Have you had experiences? Do you re|member how you have been formerly wrought upon by the word of God? Have you been led to &s;ee the wickedne&s;s of your own heart? Have you been led to &s;ee your&s;elf condemned, by the righteous &s;entence of God's law? Have you been led to &s;ee the way of e&s;cape from the wrath of God? And do you &s;uppo&s;e you were enabled to
<Q>fly for refuge, and lay hold on the hope &s;et before you?</Q>
Perhaps you then expe|rienced &s;uch joy and &s;atisfaction, that, in the fir&s;t warmth of your affections, you were ready to for&s;ake all for Chri&s;t, and even thought you could lay down your life for his &s;ake; you were eager to profe&s;s your|&s;elf his di&s;ciple, and join with them that loved re|ligion; you loved the company of tho&s;e who &s;eemed mo&s;t zealous; you loved to hear plain, practical, ex|perimental preaching; you loved to examine your&s;elf by the marks which you read, or heard, from time to time, out of the word of God; and you were plea&s;ed when you found a corre&s;pondence in your own hearts thereto; &s;o far it was well; this was a good beginning. But how is it now? How has it been ever &s;ince? Have you, ever &s;ince that time, been growing in your hatred of &s;in, and your love of ho|line&s;s? Have you, ever &s;ince that time, been morti|fying your corrupt lu&s;ts? Have you, ever &s;ince that time, been guarding again&s;t the &s;in that ea&s;ily be&s;ets you? Have you, ever &s;ince that time, been crucified to the world, and the world to you? Have you ex|perienced, and do you yet continue to experience,
<PB N="29" REF="024089_0029_0FC3326A855F2EE0">
daily conflicts with your lu&s;ts? And when you are hard driven, and pre&s;&s;ed by temptations, do you go to "the Captain of &s;alvation," and beg him to make his &s;trength perfect in your weakne&s;s? And do you experience "his grace to be &s;ufficient for you," and that with every temptation, there is a way for your e&s;cape? You have lived &s;ome time in the world, and had doubtle&s;s &s;ome experience of the vanity of it, do you find that your heart is weaned from it? that your affections are more &s;trongly &s;et on heaven? You have doubtle&s;s met with afflictions, and what experience have you had in them? Do you find that "tribulation worketh patience?" Do you receive the di&s;cipline of God's providence with meekne&s;s, with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his will, with a child-like di&s;po&s;ition? Do you rejoice in tribulation? and
<Q>count it all joy when you fall into divers trials?</Q>
Are you glad that God tries you as gold is tried, that you may be puri|fied from the dro&s;s of corruption, and have greater evidence of your own purity? And are the&s;e experi|ences accompanied with a re&s;olute &s;elf-denial? a per|&s;evering obedience to the will of God? a regard to his glory and the good of mankind? Do you
<Q>deal ju&s;tly, and love mercy, and walk humbly with your God?</Q>
Do you "forgive men their tre&s;pa&s;&s;es," as you hope God will forgive yours? And after all that you have done, or can do, do you look upon your&s;elf as an unprofitable &s;ervant, and patiently wait for your reward, till God &s;hall plea&s;e, of his free grace, through Chri&s;t, to give it to you? If &s;o, the&s;e graces and ex|periences will prove you to be built on the true foun|dation; they are among the gold, &s;ilver and precious &s;tones, which compo&s;e the &s;piritual building; but they are not your foundation; that is <HI>more precious</HI> &s;till, for it is the tried &s;tone, which God him&s;elf has
<PB N="30" REF="024089_0030_0FC3326FF5506448">
laid in Zion. But if you are &s;upporting your&s;elf with a notion that you have had &s;uch and &s;uch experiences in time pa&s;t, and are patching up a righteou&s;ne&s;s out of them; if you imagine you were once converted, and that all has been well with you &s;ince, though you have lived in the neglect of known duty, and the commi&s;&s;ion of known &s;in, without remor&s;e of con&s;cience, or de&s;ign of amendment; if evil habits are gaining &s;trength, and your corruptions are yet unmortified; if you are impatient of reproof, and unwilling to receive correction; if you are offended when your experiences are called in que&s;tion; if you are angry with &s;uch preaching as &s;erves to di&s;turb the repo&s;e of your mind, and &s;hake the foundation on which you are building; then all your pretended ex|periences are no better than "filthy rags," in which you are trying to hide your &s;hame; they are but as a foundation of &s;and, and all that you build upon it will fall into ruin; and the &s;ooner it falls, the better it will be for you. May God grant you wi&s;dom to di&s;cover the weakne&s;s of your foundation, and lead you to the "Rock of Ages," on which alone you can build with any hopes of &s;afety.</P>
<P>Finally, Let us be thankful to God for Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the only foundation which he has laid; and for the abundant evidence which he has given us of the di|vinity of his character, the perfection of his righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, the acceptance of his &s;acrifice, the preva|lence of his interce&s;&s;ion, and the future glory of his kingdom. On him, as our foundation, let us build our faith, our hope, our profe&s;&s;ion, our obedience, and our experience. We mu&s;t not pretend to hold the foundation, unle&s;s we are building thereon; for a foundation is of no u&s;e but to build upon. Having therefore begun at the right foundation, let us be
<PB N="31" REF="024089_0031_0FC33274ADFE0470">
careful that our &s;tructure con&s;i&s;t of the be&s;t materials, and avoid, as much as po&s;&s;ible, all impure and pe|ri&s;hable mixtures. And if we are building on this foundation, we &s;hall have all his glorious perfections engaged for us; his wi&s;dom to direct us, his righ|teou&s;ne&s;s to ju&s;tify us, his power to defend us, and his grace to be&s;tow on us a full reward&mdash;when he "&s;hall be revealed from heaven in flaming fire." Then, our building, though imperfect, will abide the trial, all our errors and infirmities will be purged away, and our virtuous habits will be carried to perfection.</P>
