<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>EARLY on Tue&s;day morning, the 17th in&s;tant, I re|ceived intelligence of eleven men de&s;erting to the enemy, three of whom were intercepted by parties di&s;po&s;ed for that purpo&s;e, and between two and three o'clock P. M. that day, I was informed that the remaining eight were concealed by a quaker, about &s;even miles from this place, up the Brandywine, before which, I had detached &s;even hor&s;e and two parties of foot on each &s;ide the Brandywine to intercept them, and a party of nine hor&s;e, detached with a party of foot, to remove, and if nece&s;&s;ary to de&s;troy the forage below Newca&s;tle and Port-Penn, left me de&s;ti|tute of a &s;ingle light hor&s;e fit for duty, the towns-men having removed their hor&s;es into the country upon our ar|riving here; it was therefore out of the power of the quar|ter-ma&s;ter to procure hor&s;es for this purpo&s;e, which reduced me to the di&s;agreeable nece&s;&s;ity of ordering one hor&s;e from each officer in the divi&s;ion who kept two or more, which I judged &s;upernumerary, and that the public had a right to their &s;ervice upon &s;uch an emergency, though I fir&s;t &s;ent captain Brown to apply to the colonels for a hor&s;e a piece, and informed, there was no other probable method of mounting a party and effecting the purpo&s;e, which required the greate&s;t di&s;patch; through mi&s;take captain Brown in|formed colonel Hall, he had my orders to take one of his

<PB N="6" REF="016334_0006_0F9C26B704C16458">
other officers were, there appeared a con&s;iderable agitation, occa&s;ioned, as he then learned, by &s;ome per&s;on having given information, that &s;everal de&s;erters, who had left the garri&s;on the night before, were concealed in a country|man's hou&s;e, about &s;even miles from town; whereupon the general gave orders, that they &s;hould go and &s;eize hor&s;es wherever they could find them, his, or any other officers they could get, to mount a party to endeavour to apprehend the de&s;erters; &s;oon after &s;ome per&s;on came back and reported to the general, that colonel Hall refu&s;ed to let his hor&s;e go, the general then gave peremptory orders that they &s;hould go and take a hor&s;e from any officer who had more than one; after a while a per&s;on returned to the general, and told him, that colonel Hall ab&s;olutely re|fu&s;ed, and threatened to blow out the brains of any per&s;on who would come to take a hor&s;e from him; the general then &s;ent an officer, lieutenant M&lsquo;Pher&s;on, at the head of a party under arms, and ordered him to bring a hor&s;e from colonel Hall at all events.</P>
<P>Doctor Montgomery being que&s;tioned by colonel Hall, whether the general's order, with regard to his own hor&s;es, were confined to one, or extended to them all, an&s;wers, he thinks it was confined to one. The doctor being far|ther a&s;ked, how many hor&s;es the general had in his &s;tables or pa&s;ture, an&s;wers, he thinks three, exclu&s;ive of the bri|gade major's and the doctor's own, which was then lame with the &s;cratches. Colonel Hall further a&s;ked the doctor, whether Mrs Mar&s;hall, at who&s;e hou&s;e the general lodges, had any hor&s;es, who an&s;wers, &s;he kept one all winter, but whether he was then in town or not he could not tell.</P>
<P>Captain Brown, of the artillery, was next produced at an evidence, who upon oath declares, That a few days ago, upon his informing general Smallwood that &s;even of his company, and one of the &s;econd regiment, who had de&s;erted the night before, were concealed about &s;even miles out of town, he directed him to collect a number of officers to go after the de&s;erters, and al&s;o to get hor&s;es, to
<PB N="7" REF="016334_0007_0F9C26B7C3A02578">
take one of his fir&s;t, and then go to the other officers, be|ginning with the colonels commandant, for others; that he thereupon went to colonel J. Carvil Hall, and told him that the general had &s;ent him there to take one of his hor&s;es to go after &s;ome de&s;erters he had heard of, that the general had given one of his own, and had ordered him to go to the other officers, beginning with the colonels com|mandant, for others.</P>
<P>Colonel Hall then an&s;wered, he did not know any right the general had to order or take his hor&s;es, he might di&s;|po&s;e of his own as he plea&s;ed, but that he &s;hould not have his, and he would not let them go. Colonel Hall then a&s;ked captain Brown, if he did not tell him at the &s;ame time, that the general had a right to command him and his &s;ervices, but he had no authority over his hor&s;es, they were his private property; he an&s;wered yes, he &s;poke words to that effect.</P>
<P>Lieutenant Brown, of the light hor&s;e, upon oath &s;aith, that he was with captain Brown when he told the general about his de&s;erters, upon which the general a&s;ked him (lieutenant Brown) if he had any hor&s;e to &s;pare to go after them, that he an&s;wered he had not, that they were all upon duty who were fit to do duty.</P>
<P>Colonel Sheriff, quarter-ma&s;ter to the divi&s;ion, was next &s;worn, who &s;aith, That general Smallwood, on Tue&s;day la&s;t, &s;ent him the following order, viz. Ordered, that co|lonel Sheriff impre&s;s one hor&s;e from each officer in the di|vi&s;ion who keeps two or more. That upon his receiving the order, he immediately endor&s;ed it as follows, viz. Sir, 'tis the general's expre&s;s orders to begin with the colonels of the regiments, and act as within ordered; which en|dor&s;ement he directed to Mr. Edmond&s;on, a waggon-ma&s;|ter belonging to the divi&s;ion.</P>
<P>Colonel Sheriff was then a&s;ked, whether he thinks hor&s;es could not have been got &s;ufficient for the party, without taking the officers hor&s;es; an&s;wers, he thinks they could not have been got in le&s;s than two hours.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="016334_0008_0F9C26B90D605100">Mr. Edmond&s;on, brigade waggon-ma&s;ter, was next &s;worn, who &s;aith, That colonel Sheriff delivered him the orders above recited, which he &s;hewed to colonel Hall, that co|lonel Hall told him he &s;hould have none of his, upon which he returned to colonel Sheriff, and colonel Sheriff directed him to inform the general of what had pa&s;&s;ed; the general then ordered him to return to colonel Hall, and tell him, if he did not let his hor&s;e come, that he, this de|ponent, &s;hould take a party and bring one down; he in|formed colonel Hall of this order, to which colonel Hall replied, that he or any other per&s;on who &s;hould head the party, he would put a bullet through; that he then re|turned to the general, and informed him what colonel Hall had &s;aid.</P>
<P>Lieutenant M&lsquo;Pher&s;on being duly &s;worn, declareth, That on Tue&s;day la&s;t general Smallwood &s;ent for him, and upon his coming to his quarters, the general met him in the pa&s;&s;age, and ordered him to go and fetch his guard, upon which he went to the back yard, where he found the guard parading, and brought them to the front door, and then went in to the general and told him the guard was ready, whereupon he &s;at down and wrote the following orders, viz. Sir, You are ordered with the guard immediately to pro|ceed and impre&s;s one of colonel Hall's hor&s;es, and bring him here without delay, as there are &s;ome de&s;erters, if di&s;|patch is u&s;ed, may be taken. Herein fail not, and this &s;hall be your ju&s;tification.</P>
<P>After receiving the order, he went at the head of the guard to colonel Hall's quarters, where upon enquiry, he found the colonel was rode out, upon which he went to the colonel's &s;tables, and looking in at the window he &s;aw a hor&s;e &s;addled, which the forage-ma&s;ter (who was al&s;o &s;ent by the general) &s;aid was the colonel's hor&s;e; this de|ponent then ordered the guard to break open the door, which was locked, but upon their entering they found it was not colonel Hall's hor&s;e, though immediately after|wards colonel Hall's hor&s;e came running up to the &s;table
<PB N="9" REF="016334_0009_0F9C26B944641988">
door, having a &s;addle on but no bridle, the deponent then cau&s;ed the &s;oldiers to catch the hor&s;e, and they returned with the hor&s;e under guard to the general.</P>
<P>The following evidences were then called upon by colo|nel Carvil Hall, viz.</P>
<P>Captain Steward, of the artillery, being &s;worn, de|clareth, That he was at colonel Hall's quarters when cap|tain Brown came for his hor&s;e, and that he under&s;tood his application to be founded upon an ab&s;olute order to take the colonel's hor&s;e; that the colonel refu&s;ed to let him have his hor&s;e, &s;aying, that the general might command his &s;ervices, but his hor&s;e he had no right to, he was his private property, and &s;ome time afterwards, (this depo|nent thinks after captain Brown went away) colonel Hall told him, and &s;ome others that were pre&s;ent, that he had already lent his hor&s;e.</P>
<P>Lieutenant Hoops was next called upon, who upon oath declareth, That a few days ago, upon hearing that &s;ome de&s;erters were concealed a little way out of town, and that the general wanted a party of officers to go after them, he went to colonel Hall's quarters with an intention of bor|rowing a hor&s;e from his payma&s;ter, and finding the pay|ma&s;ter not at home, he mentioned his bu&s;ine&s;s to the colo|nel, who told him to &s;end to the &s;table and get his hor&s;e for that purpo&s;e; he &s;ent accordingly and got the hor&s;e and carried him off, and having hitched him to a po&s;t until the party would be ready, &s;ometime afterwards he under|&s;tood the hor&s;e was at the general's, where he went and reque&s;ted he might ride him, which the general, after &s;ome he&s;itation, agreed to. Lieut. Hoops was a&s;ked by the court, whether or no he had borrowed the hor&s;e before the general had &s;ent for him? An&s;wered, he did not know.</P>
<P>The court adjourns to 9 o'clock to-morrow morning.</P>
<P>March 21. The court met according to adjournment. D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ctor Montgomery was called upon a &s;econd time at the de&s;ire of general Smallwood, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ked him the following que&s;tions, viz. Whether or no he did not apprehend from
<PB N="10" REF="016334_0010_0F9C26BA03F784A8">
the repre&s;entation made by captain Brown, there was not a nece&s;&s;ity offending off immediately? An&s;wered, that from the repre&s;entation he had of the matter he thought it of the utmo&s;t importance that a party &s;hould be &s;ent off immediately.</P>
<P>Que&s;t. 2d. Does Mr. Montgomery recollect that I ex|pre&s;&s;ed my doubts that hor&s;es could not be got unle&s;s the officers hor&s;es were taken, and therefore ordered captain Brown to take one of mine, and apply to the other officers for theirs, as the only probable method of mounting the party? An&s;wers yes.</P>
<P>Que&s;t. 3d. Does Mr. Montgomery recollect the &s;tate which my hor&s;es were in, and his, and whether any of them were fit for the expedition, but the one I ordered? An&s;wers, he thinks none were fit but the one.</P>
<P>Captain Brown was next called upon and que&s;tioned by the general. Does captain Brown recollect that I expre&s;&s;ed my doubts of obtaining hor&s;es &s;o &s;peedily as might be ne|ce&s;&s;ary, unle&s;s the officers hor&s;es were taken, and that I directed him to take one of mine, and apply to the colo|nels for one a piece, and to the other officers for their hor&s;es, which mu&s;t be pre&s;&s;ed, as there was no probable way of getting hor&s;es otherways &s;o &s;peedily as it was nece&s;|&s;ary? An&s;wers, yes, I remember it well.</P>
<P>Que&s;t. How long does captain Brown think colonel Hall's refu&s;ing his hor&s;e delayed the party, and at what o'clock does he think he made the application? An&s;wers, he thinks he made the application between two and three o'clock, and that his refu&s;al delayed the party better than an hour.</P>
<P>Colonel Hall then a&s;ked captain Brown, whether he thinks his hor&s;e was indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary for the form|ing that party? An&s;wers, he thinks he was.</P>
<P>Que&s;t. 2d. How many did the party con&s;i&s;t of? An&s;wers, twelve, exclu&s;ive of the guide.</P>
<P>Que&s;t. 3d. Colonel Hall then a&s;ked captain Brown, whether he viewed his hor&s;e as a talis-man. or whether there was any particular virtue in the number twelve? An|&s;wers,
<PB N="11" REF="016334_0011_0F9C26BAC5593B70">
he did not think there was any particular virtue in the number twelve, but thinks three or four more would have been nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The general then a&s;ked captain Brown, whether or no &s;everal officers were not waiting who could not go for want of hor&s;es? An&s;wers, there were three or four who did not go for want of hor&s;es</P>
<P>Colonel Sheriff was then a&s;ked by the general, does co|lonel Sheriff apprehend he could have got fifteen or &s;ixteen hor&s;es in the town in the cour&s;e of that afternoon, without taking the officers hor&s;es agreeable to the order given him by the general? An&s;wers, he thinks they could not have been got.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="testimony">
<HEAD>Colonel HALL'S DEFENCE.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t part of the charge is di&s;obeying a general order, I deny that any general order was ever delivered me; it is true captain Brown came to me and told me the general had &s;ent him to take one of my hor&s;es. I viewed his calling upon me before he went to my &s;table and took my hor&s;e, which from his orders, if legal, he had a right to do, a piece of politene&s;s. I confe&s;s &s;o extraordinary a mandate hurt my feelings, and I forbid him. The &s;econd order, which was in writing, was brought by a waggon-ma&s;ter, and was by no means addre&s;&s;ed to me, and which he al&s;o might have executed without ever calling upon me. The third and la&s;t order was &s;imilar to the other two, and which the officer put in execution by breaking open my &s;table door, without ever &s;eeing me, as the others might have done theirs. If the court are of opinion that any of the&s;e were orders, for the breach of which an officer can be puni&s;hed, I mu&s;t confe&s;s hitherto I have been igno|rant what an order means. But &s;uppo&s;e the order was to me, I was not bound to obey it, it was unmilitary, and a precedent of the mo&s;t dangerous con&s;equence. Military authors of the fir&s;t reputation agree, that the mo&s;t ready and <HI>implicit</HI> obedience is due to every military order or command re&s;pecting duty, but at the &s;ame time po&s;itively
<PB N="12" REF="016334_0012_0F9C26BB83AEF670">
deny the right, and &s;trictly forbid the <HI>exertion</HI> of power to interfere in private property. The general might have prohibited me from drawing forage for my hor&s;e, he might have forbid my keeping a hor&s;e in the garri&s;on, I mean as commander of the po&s;t, but &s;o long as I was permitted to keep a hor&s;e, he was my own private property to every in|tent and meaning, as fully as my coat, my &s;hirt, or any thing el&s;e in my trunk, and as I have two coats, he might by the &s;ame rule of right, i. e. power, have ordered my trunk to be broke open, and one of them delivered to &s;ome naked &s;oldier who could not do duty for the want of one. If I am not very much mi&s;taken, I remember to have &s;een an order of his Excellency's, expre&s;sly confining the power of impre&s;&s;ing hor&s;es to the quarter-ma&s;ter-general, or his deputy, who may de&s;cend deputi&s;ing till it comes to the deputy waggon-ma&s;ter's deputy's &s;ervant, who &s;hall have a right, if this precedent is e&s;tabli&s;hed, to di&s;mount any general, except the commander in chief, who may be &s;o unlucky as to give him offence; for if the quarter-ma&s;ter had an authority to impre&s;s an officer's hor&s;e at all, he had it independent of general Smallwood, who by the above order appears to be excluded that right&mdash;if then the quar|ter-ma&s;ter's right to impre&s;s officers hor&s;es cannot be ad|mitted with any degree of con&s;i&s;tency, and the general ne|ver was inve&s;ted with that right. I know not on what mi|litary principle he can ju&s;tify his ordering the quarter-ma&s;|ter to impre&s;s my hor&s;e, and much le&s;s his aiding him with an armed force to break open my door. The very idea of military force in &s;uch ca&s;es is a denial of the right, it &s;up|po&s;es an urgent nece&s;&s;ity, requiring the immediate exertion of power to deprive an <HI>individual</HI> of his right for the greater good of the who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, becau&s;e, if every one is obliged by law to furni&s;h the general with a hor&s;e on demand, he has no need of an armed force, as they are puni&s;hable by the civil law for a refu&s;al. The di&s;tinction in a civil and miliary view will not hold here, for when I entered the &s;ervice of my country, by no act of mine did I &s;ubject my
<PB N="13" REF="016334_0013_0F9C26BC43AE42C0">
private property to the di&s;po&s;al of my commanding officer. It follows then, if the general had no <HI>right</HI> to take my hor&s;e, I had a right to refu&s;e him, &s;o that admitting that the order was to me, I was not obliged to obey it, and con&s;equently am unju&s;tly arre&s;ted; but as the la&s;t charge, however illy grounded, may carry a &s;mall degree of crimi|nality in the opinion of &s;ome of the members, I mu&s;t beg their indulgence a little longer, while I make a few ob&s;er|vations on that head. I acknowledged above I oppo&s;ed the execution of the general's <HI>pointed</HI> orders to take my hor&s;e, but I could not di&s;obey them, they were not direct|ed to me, and rou&s;ed by the arbitrary and illegal &s;tretch of power, I did, upon the &s;ame principles that induced me fir&s;t to take up arms in defence of the rights of man|kind, threaten to defend it at the expence of the invader's life, but on the fir&s;t moment's cool reflection gave up the re&s;olution, becau&s;e the illegality of the proceedings might be determined at much le&s;s expence than the life of a man, who, perhaps, thought he was in the execution of his du|ty. I had lent one hor&s;e to lieutenant Hoops to go upon the expedition far which he was demanded, and purpo&s;ely to avoid the execution of my threat, mounted the other &s;omewhat earlier than nece&s;&s;ary, to train the regiment. Upon the whole, if the court finds me not guilty of a breach of order, or that tho&s;e orders were illegal, I &s;hall readily re&s;t the ju&s;tification of my conduct in the third charge, on an appeal to their own brea&s;ts, and to every one who&s;e feeling renders him worthy a commi&s;&s;ion in de|fence of a cau&s;e the mo&s;t virtuous that ever men were en|gaged in.</P>

<P>The court with re&s;pect to the fir&s;t charge exhibited a|gain&s;t colonel Hall, are of opinion, that the order i&s;&s;ued in that in&s;tance was not military, nor conveyed through a military channel; that the general, by conveying it through the hands of the quarter-ma&s;ter, in the nature of an im|pre&s;&s;ment, not even addre&s;&s;ed to colonel Hall, was an ac|tual confe&s;&s;ion that he had not a right to expect or exact a compliance with the order by virtue of his &s;uperior com|mand. And with re&s;pect to the &s;econd charge, although the court does by no means approve of colonel Hall's in|tentions or threats of re&s;i&s;ting by force the officer &s;ent to execute the order, yet as they can ea&s;ily account for it, from the keen and &s;en&s;ible feelings of a per&s;on in his &s;itua|tion, and as a few moments cool reflection determined him to act otherwi&s;e, we acquit him of un-officer-like beha|viour: and are upon the whole unanimou&s;ly of opinion, that he is not guilty of the charge exhibited again&s;t him, and therefore acquit him with honour.</P>

<P>AS I was not privy to, or favoured with a copy of co|lonel Hall's defence to the court, till after the &s;entence
<PB N="15" REF="016334_0015_0F9C26BDC4579A50">
was handed in to me, in ju&s;tice therefore to my&s;elf I am bound to make the following remarks, as I think &s;everal parts of his defence exceptionable and unju&s;t.</P>
<P>Colonel Hall has taken great pains to ju&s;tify his conduct to the court-martial, and has made u&s;e of a number of &s;pecious arguments for that purpo&s;e, wherein it may be ob&s;erved, that all his rea&s;onings are more properly ad|dre&s;&s;ed to the pa&s;&s;ions than to the ju&s;tice and judgment of tho&s;e gentlemen who compo&s;ed the court: truth and rec|titude need no glo&s;s to recommend them&s;elves to the can|did mind, and notwith&s;tanding &s;uch &s;plendid argumenta|tion, the ca&s;e in hand illu&s;trates it&s;elf, and re&s;ts entirely upon its own merits, as &s;et forth in the evidence pro|duced.</P>
<P>That colonel Hall di&s;obeyed my orders, is a fact that the colonel him&s;elf does not controvert; that his compli|ance with them would have aided the &s;ervice, is as noto|rious; but whether tho&s;e orders were in them&s;elves unmi|litary, or i&s;&s;ued in an unmilitary way, it certainly was not the bu&s;ine&s;s of a good officer to oppo&s;e their operation. As colonel Hall &s;eems to be conver&s;ant with military au|thors, he will find &s;everal who pronounce, that officers have not even a right to declare a general order, which has a tendency to promote the &s;ervice, though i&s;&s;ued out of the common line, illegal or oppre&s;&s;ive, till &s;uch order has been carried into execution, and its effects make it appear to be &s;o. If general orders of this nature are to be oppo&s;ed in one in&s;tance, they may in a thou&s;and, and from &s;uch a precedent the con&s;equence might be, that an officer in time of action might refu&s;e to obey the orders of his commanding officer at the head of a line of battle, be|cau&s;e the orders were not con&s;onant with his opinion, and that they were unmilitary, or i&s;&s;ued in an unmilitary man|ner. Such a di&s;po&s;ition for cavilling might be admi&s;&s;ible at the bar of a county court, but can have no tendency to promote the &s;ervice, or create a good officer. If the com|mander in chief had i&s;&s;ued orders upon a &s;imilar emergency,
<PB N="16" REF="016334_0016_0F9C26BE84162480">
directing the quarter-ma&s;ter-general to impre&s;s one hor&s;e from each officer in the line, who had from two to &s;ix, a|greeable to their re&s;pective rank and limitation, not to mention &s;upernumeraries, and any officer had refu&s;ed to let the quarter-ma&s;ter-general put that order in execution, I &s;hould judge and pronounce him guilty of a breach of a general order, though the order was not particularly ad|dre&s;&s;ed to him.</P>
<P>Every order given out by a commanding officer, which in its operation is general, and calculated to aid the &s;er|vice, is and ought to be obeyed as a general order, and will be re&s;pected as &s;uch by every good officer, who would make a point of &s;acrificing his private views to the good of his country.</P>
<P>Hor&s;es were to be impre&s;&s;ed from &s;uch officers, who had more than one, as they could no otherways be had; no officer was pointed out by name, and con&s;equently the or|der could not be particularly directed to any one; they who were p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of more than one, came within the in|tent and de&s;cription of this order; colonel Hall among others was affected by it; but he tells us he will not obey the order; 'tis <HI>unmilitary,</HI> 'tis <HI>a bad precedent,</HI> 'tis <HI>tyranny,</HI> 'tis <HI>de&s;poti&s;m.</HI> But if colonel Hall will again peru&s;e his <HI>mi|litary authors</HI> of the fir&s;t reputation, he will there find (I flatter my&s;elf) no law, rule or cu&s;tom, authori&s;ing officers to di&s;pute or di&s;obey the commands of their &s;uperior of|ficer, though they &s;hould appear incon&s;i&s;tent. Mo&s;t authors tell us, orders are fir&s;t to be obeyed, and then the validity of them are to be canva&s;&s;ed, and a remedy can ea&s;ily be obtained after &s;ervice done.</P>
<P>The import of the word duty is great, and the idea in|definite; and the way to circum&s;cribe its extent is for an officer to do every thing, and obey every order, that ap|pears calculated to promote the good of that &s;ervice which he is engaged in. The circum&s;tances that appear in the proceedings of the court-martial in con&s;equence of the or|der, will &s;hew whether it was calculated to promote the
<PB N="17" REF="016334_0017_0F9C26BF43BB5A50">
afore&s;aid purpo&s;es, and whether colonel Hall was ju&s;tifiable in refu&s;ing to obey them.</P>
<P>I view the hor&s;e in que&s;tion as a &s;upernumerary, fed up|on &s;ufferance, and an expence to the public which was not allowed; certainly the public had a right to his &s;ervices, at lea&s;t for a few hours. Was colonel Hall's &s;upernume|rary <HI>coat</HI> to eat and drink at the public expence, its &s;er|vices might be required with as much propriety as its ma&s;|ter's; however, the allegory is as foreign to the &s;ubject, as the colonel's behaviour has been un-officer-like.</P>
<P>The colonel thinks he has &s;een an order of his excel|lency's, confining the power of impre&s;&s;ing to the quarter-ma&s;ter-general or his deputy; this directly proves that power is lodged &s;omewhere, and al&s;o pre&s;uppo&s;es a right to exi&s;t in the commander in chief to carry &s;uch powers into execution through the proper channels. Ab&s;tracted from my in&s;tructions, which in this and other lights are pretty exten&s;ive, as commander of this garri&s;on, I am mo&s;t cer|tainly inve&s;ted with a &s;imilar right in the circle of my com|mand, and therefore &s;hould judge an order directed to my divi&s;ion quarter-ma&s;ter of equal validity.</P>
<P>I &s;hould apprehend the quarter-ma&s;ter-general, or his deputies, are the only per&s;ons to receive and carry into execution orders for impre&s;&s;ing hor&s;es, &amp;c. and had I or|dered that duty to have pa&s;&s;ed through any other line, then the colonel him&s;elf might with great propriety have pronounced it unmilitary. To impre&s;s hor&s;es or any other &s;pecies of private property always implies an urgent nece&s;|&s;ity for &s;uch a mea&s;ure, and the nece&s;&s;ity implies &s;ome|thing of importance to be effected, which otherways could not be brought about. In &s;uch ca&s;e no true friend to his country ought to oppo&s;e or throw the lea&s;t impediment in the way, and the per&s;ons and property of officers, in my opinion, are not more &s;acred than tho&s;e o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the farmers, who, though they do not fight, yet feed tho&s;e who do, and are as nece&s;&s;ary members of &s;ociety as the former. I agree that &s;ome men are actuated by intere&s;ted and merce|nary

views, others by a &s;pirit of contradiction and impa|tience of controul, and in &s;uch ca&s;es will not lend their property with their own con&s;ent; then force becomes ne|ce&s;&s;ary and indi&s;pen&s;able. Had colonel Hall like a good officer obeyed tho&s;e orders, which were neither new or un|precedented, I &s;hould not have been under the nece&s;&s;ity of u&s;ing a military force; therefore when the colonel, in the high flood of his wi&s;dom, makes u&s;e of this circum&s;tance to di&s;prove the right of impre&s;&s;ing officers hor&s;es, his argu|ments only tend to convince the judicious of the nece&s;&s;ity of taking &s;uch mea&s;ures, to reduce turbulent and refracto|ry &s;pirits to a &s;en&s;e of their duty.</P>
<P>When an officer once deviates from the line of his pro|fe&s;&s;ion, by di&s;puting and controverting orders, 'tis neither &s;trange or uncommon to find him ju&s;tifying one breach by the commi&s;&s;ion of another. I am &s;orry to include the co|lonel in this de&s;cription; but after violating the order and putting on the cavalier with his commanding officer, he attempts to move the pa&s;&s;ions of the court by all the quib|bling ca&s;ui&s;try of an attorney, mi&s;tating facts, drawing unfair inferences, tending to mi&s;lead the judgment; this certainly is no evidence of candour, whatever it may be of ingenuity. As I have been honoured with the com|mand of this garri&s;on by his excellency general Wa&s;hing|ton, he certainly has inve&s;ted me with every power for the good government thereof; therefore I apprehend, among many other powers received for that purpo&s;e, the power of impre&s;&s;ing hor&s;es, &amp;c. was one: this power enables me up|on an emergency to impre&s;s colonel Hall's &s;upernumerary hor&s;e, and would perhaps have ju&s;tified my going farther. If that power be arbitrary and illegal, the remedy mu&s;t be &s;ought for and obtained at the fountain head. If then the power of ordering hor&s;es to be impre&s;&s;ed is ve&s;ted in me, colonel Hall, according to his own argument, had no right to refu&s;e, and con&s;equently the arre&s;t is ju&s;t and le|gal. The path<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tic di&s;play of arbitrary power, inva&s;ion of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> property, breach of privilege, and a number of o|ther
<PB N="19" REF="016334_0019_0F9C26C154769A08">
eloquent allu&s;ions, may divert the fancy, but &s;hould never bia&s;s the judgment of men of &s;en&s;e; nor do I believe this kind of rhap&s;ody has had any undue influence on the minds of the court, and notwith&s;tanding they are intere&s;ted in the event of the trial, my partiality for them induces me to think they made up their determination from an im|pre&s;&s;ion of an impropriety in the addre&s;s of the order, which I &s;till apprehend has gone through the proper chan|nel; however, this will be determined by his excellency general Wa&s;hington, in his approbation or di&s;approbation of the &s;entence. As the order was not addre&s;&s;ed to colonel Hall, it is &s;uppo&s;ed he was not bound to obey it. I would a&s;k, was I to order the whole garri&s;on under arms at &s;uch an hour, whether colonel Hall, not being particularly mentioned in the order, would think him&s;elf bound to obey &s;uch an order, and form his regiment? According to the colonel's private opinion and the determination he would certainly not be obliged to pay any attention to it.</P>
<P>Doubtle&s;s there are many officers who have as ju&s;t a &s;en&s;e of the merits of this pre&s;ent conte&s;t as colonel Hall, and are as hone&s;t men, who have &s;uffered in their per&s;ons, and &s;acrificed as much, nay I will venture to &s;ay more, to the &s;hrine of freedom, without all that di&s;play of integrity and &s;upererrogation that the colonel &s;ets forth.</P>
<P>That colonel Hall refu&s;ed to obey my orders is a fact that is allowed; that he threatened to take the life of the per&s;on authori&s;ed to execute the&s;e orders is al&s;o allowed; which conduct is certainly unlike an officer: wherefore I conclude, that colonel Hall is guilty of all the charges laid again&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">im in the full meaning and intent of the words.</P>

him&s;elf pointed at particularly by the order from which he relieved the &s;ubs then on duty.</P>

<P>Court met according to adjournment. Colonel Ford being duly &s;worn, depo&s;eth and &s;aith, on being a&s;ked by the court at the de&s;ire of the general, Whether general Smallwood did not ob&s;erve as follows:</P>
<P>Que&s;tion by general Smallwood. Did I not ob&s;erve to you, that the &s;carcity of officers and their &s;cruples about rank would render it difficult to make up a court-martial, unle&s;s the officers would wave their &s;cruples? And did I not de&s;ire you to give my compliments to them, and to beg that they would wave them in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, as there were &s;o many pri&s;oners who were an incumbrance?</P>
<P>An&s;wer by colonel Ford. The general did make the foregoing ob&s;ervations, and that he informed the court that the general hoped they would on that occa&s;ion wave their &s;cruples.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. Did you not acquaint the general, that all were willing to &s;erve, except Long, Eccle&s;ton and Nor|wood.</P>
<P>An&s;wer. I informed the general, that captains Long, Eccle&s;ton and Norwood, would not wave their &s;cruples.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion by the court. Did you inform the general, that captain Norwood was willing to &s;it agreeable to the general order?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. I heard no &s;uch thing, nor did I inform the general of &s;uch a thing.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion by the general. Did I not ob&s;erve that I &s;hould be under the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ending tho&s;e three gen|tlemen to relieve the &s;ubs on piquet, and place them that were on piquet on the court martial; as the &s;carcity of officers rendered this mea&s;ure nece&s;&s;ary? and did not I ob&s;erve, that I hoped the officers who &s;crupled to &s;it on court-martial on account of rank, would not think I pointed at them, as I had no other alternative?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. I think you made ob&s;ervations to that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="016334_0028_0F9C26C783557078">Que&s;tion. How many field officers are there in camp for duty?</P>

<P>An&s;wer. I think it has.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. From the duty they have done, would it not from your knowledge have been partial in me to have put them on the court-martial, and exempted the captains, who have done much le&s;s duty, from mounting on piquet?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. I do not know that captains have mounted piquet &s;ince we came to this po&s;t, until the time when captains Long, Eccle&s;ton and Norwood were ordered to relieve the piquets.</P>
<P>Que&s;tions a&s;ked by captain Norwood of colonel Ford. How long had the &s;ubs done duty at this place before they were ordered to be relieved by captains?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. I think it was the &s;econd day.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. Could not that court to your knowledge have been compo&s;ed, without relieving the &s;ubalterns by cap|tains, by putting field officers on that court, as well as the pre&s;ent?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. I think not, as colonel Woolford being a &s;e|nior officer to me, the court mu&s;t have been di&s;&s;olved, had he &s;at.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. Could not that court have been compo&s;ed except one member?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. I think it could, by putting major Howard and major Steward on.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. Did not colonel Ford hear me &s;ay, I was willing to &s;it on that court-martial agreeable to the Mary|land ro&s;ter?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. I think I did.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion by the general. Was not major Howard re|lieved by colonel Woolford the morning the court was or|dered?</P>

<P>Que&s;tion by the general. When was the court-martial ordered of which you was pre&s;ident?</P>

<P>An&s;wer. Yes.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. Did you know that major Steward was ap|pointed to relieve colonel Woolford on the 31&s;t ult.?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. Major Steward was appointed, but I did the duty in his room.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion by captain Norwood to major Howard. Could not a court-martial have been compo&s;ed on the 30th ult. by putting on three field officers, and leaving an officer to do the field duty?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. I believe it might have been done, by compre|hending the field officers who came off duty that morning.</P>

<P>Que&s;tion. Do you know, from the &s;carcity of officers and the hard duty of field and &s;ubaltern officers, that I could have relieved the piquets otherwi&s;e, without injuring the field and &s;ubaltern officers much more than the cap|tains?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. I think they mu&s;t have been injured more than the captains, from the returns that I have &s;een.</P>

<P>An&s;wer. I heard &s;ome of them &s;ay they would not be relieved but by captains, and I think they could not be relieved by captains without di&s;&s;olving the court-martial.</P>

<P>I HAVE read and con&s;idered the proceedings of the court-martial in the ca&s;e of captain Norwood. If our mi|litary con&s;titution does not authori&s;e the court to inve&s;ti|gate the third charge exhibited again&s;t him, and to deter|mine upon the &s;ame, and on the defence he offers, no powers can be derived from me for the purpo&s;e. However I am of opinion that they have a juri&s;diction in the ca&s;e, and that though a trial before &s;uch a court may in its con|&s;equences and operation bring in que&s;tion the character of a general officer, yet that this circum&s;tance will not &s;uper|&s;ede their power of enquiry, as to the matters in charge, as they are not to pa&s;s &s;entence again&s;t the general officer. This I deliver as mere matter of opinion, and without the lea&s;t de&s;ign or wi&s;h to influence the court to proceed in the ca&s;e of captain Norwood, if their &s;entiments are &s;till the &s;ame re&s;pecting the incompetency of their power.</P>

<P>Captain Norwood, of the fourth Maryland regiment, appeared before the court, and they proceeded to an in|ve&s;tigation of the two fir&s;t charges exhibited again&s;t him, to which he had before plead Not Guilty.</P>
<P>The charges were, 1&s;t. Publicly declaring and implying that he did not regard the cen&s;ure of the commander in chief, becau&s;e the facts &s;et forth to him on his (captain Norwood's) trial, were mi&s;tated.</P>

<P><PB N="36" REF="016334_0036_0F9C26CD8365A4E8">General Smallwood made an objection to the court's proceeding on the two fir&s;t articles of the charge exhibited again&s;t captain Norwood, unle&s;s they would include the whole of the charge, in which ca&s;e he was willing to give captain Norwood the fulle&s;t power of ju&s;tifying his expre&s;|&s;ions with which he was charged.</P>
<P>The court, after con&s;idering the objection made by ge|neral Smallwood to their proceeding further in the ca&s;e of captain Norwood, were of opinion, that it was inadmi&s;&s;i|ble, &s;ince &s;topping their proceeding in con&s;equence of this objection, would be &s;uppo&s;ing that they had no right to continue them, and con&s;equently, that an officer who has arre&s;ted another po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the power of preventing the &s;u|preme military court in the American army from examin|ing into the merits of the charge.</P>

his Excellency attended more to the repre&s;entation made by general Smallwood than to the proceedings of the court-martial, though I did not think you <HI>meant</HI> to convey this idea.</P>
<P>Lieutenant Baily depo&s;es and &s;ays, That while the army lay at Valley-Forge, he heard captain Norwood &s;ay, in a public company, that he did not much mind the reprimand given him in general orders, becau&s;e he &s;u&s;pected that the facts on which he was tried had been mi&s;repre&s;ented to his Excellency by general Smallwood.</P>

<P>Captain Norwood urges in his defence, That he never did, and never intended, to in&s;inuate any thing injurious to his Excellency, or to the court-martial, that it was ge|neral Smallwood only on whom he reflected.</P>
<P>The court having con&s;idered the charges and the evi|dence, are of opinion, that captain Norwood did &s;ay, that he did not regard, or did not <HI>mind,</HI> the cen&s;ure of the com|mander in chief, becau&s;e the facts &s;tated to him on his (captain Norwood's) trial were mi&s;repre&s;ented; and are farther of opinion, that his expre&s;&s;ion had a tendency (though captain Norwood could not mean it) to reflect on his Excellency, as well as on general Smallwood. The court find captain Norwood guilty of breaches of the 5th article of the 18th &s;ection, and of the 2d article of the 2d &s;ection of the articles of war, and do &s;entence him to be reprimanded in general orders.

<P>It is &s;tated to the court by general Smallwood, that it was not at his particular reque&s;t that the court (as recited in their proceedings) deferred hearing witne&s;&s;es on the fir&s;t and &s;econd charges exhibited again&s;t captain Norwood, till he might be pro&s;ecuted for the third article of the charge likewi&s;e, but on the contrary, general Smallwood reque&s;t|ed the court to proceed on an inve&s;tigation of the articles of the charge at large, and to give captain Norwood every latitude he would a&s;k of ju&s;tifying his a&s;&s;ertions, by ad|ducing evidence in &s;upport of them, and recurring to the proceedings of his trial on a late court-martial, wherein he was charged with a breach of general orders, on which he was found guilty, &s;entenced to be reprimanded, and was farther cen&s;ured by the commander in chief, which cen&s;ure gave ri&s;e to the expre&s;&s;ions from which the la&s;t article of the charge originated&mdash;But on the court determining that they were incompetent to proceed on the third article of the charge, for rea&s;ons exhibited al&s;o in their proceedings, general Smallwood then objected to their proceeding on

<P>THE commander in chief finds him&s;elf under the di&s;a|greeable nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;approving the proceedings of the court, becau&s;e they have not tried all the charges exhibited before them on each fact; agreeable to precedent and com|mon u&s;age, they ought to have given either a &s;entence of acquittal or condemnation. To this end their power and juri&s;diction &s;eem to have been fully competent; the third charge, from its very nature, implied a right of ju&s;tifica|tion in the pri&s;oner could not be di&s;criminated in point of rea&s;on from either of the preceding ones, or any other, the matter in que&s;tion between the parties in this in&s;tance was the character and conduct of one of them. The pri&s;oner, by the &s;tronge&s;t implication, acknowledged he had made the charge as &s;tated, and if permitted would ju&s;tify it; general Smallwood, on the other hand, con|&s;ented and declared him&s;elf willing, that the &s;hould have the fulle&s;t power of doing it; this circum&s;tance, &s;uppo&s;ing there had been room for doubt before re&s;pecting the court's authority to try the matter, was &s;ufficient to remove every objection.

<P>Captain Norwood refu&s;ed to plead to the two fir&s;t arti|cles of the charge exhibited again&s;t him, he urged that he had already been tried on them by a former court-martial, and that he could not be tried twice for the &s;ame facts.</P>
<P>The court having con&s;idered the objection made by cap|tain Norwood, are of opinion, that our military con&s;titu|tion undoubtedly ve&s;ts the commander in chief with the power of di&s;approving the proceedings of a court martial, and of ordering an officer to be tried again by the &s;ame or another court. The court were farther of opinion, that as general orders of the fourth in&s;tant po&s;itively directed them to proceed on the whole of the charge, they would inve&s;ti|gate the two fir&s;t articles of the charge exhibited again&s;t captain Norwood, in the &s;ame manner as if he had plead to them.</P>
<P>Captain Norwood pleads guilty of the third charge, and urges in ju&s;tification that his expre&s;&s;ions were true.</P>
<P>Captain Norwood objected to general Smallwood's a&s;k|ing any que&s;tions of the &s;everal witne&s;&s;es who &s;hould be ex|amined in the cour&s;e of his trial; he contends, that the general can have no right to a&s;k any que&s;tions, as the judge-advocate alone is empowered to pro&s;ecute.</P>
<P>The court were of opinion, that, as the principal end propo&s;ed by a court-martial mu&s;t be to di&s;cover the truth, and as general Smallwood might a&s;k many que&s;tions which had a tendency to illucidate the different charges, he &s;hould be permitted to propo&s;e any que&s;tions, which, if thought proper by the court, &s;hould be a&s;ked by the judge-advocate.</P>

Captain Norwood &s;aid farther, that he would make it his bu&s;ine&s;s to declare pub|licly in every company, that general Smallwood was a par|tial man and no gentleman.</P>
<P>Lieutenant Bailey depo&s;es and &s;ays, That while the ar|my lay at Valley-Forge, he heard captain Norwood &s;ay in a public company, that he did not <HI>much mind</HI> the repri|mand he had received in general orders, becau&s;e he ima|gined, that the facts on which he was tried had been mi&s;|repre&s;ented to his Excellency by general Smallwood. He &s;aid farther, that general Smallwood was a partial man and no gentleman, and that he would a&s;&s;ert this in every pub|lic company into which he &s;hould go.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion by the court. Do you know what gave occa&s;ion to the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions u&s;ed by captain Norwood?</P>

<P>Que&s;tion by the court. Was there any general order di|recting that &s;ubalterns &s;hould relieve captains?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. An expre&s;s order was i&s;&s;ued for that purpo&s;e.</P>

<P>Que&s;tion by the pri&s;oner. Did you ever hear me &s;ay any thing comprehended in the charges exhibited again&s;t me before this court?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. I heard you, in the court-martial at Chad's-Ford, tell general Smallwood, that you thought he was partial in trying you when he had relea&s;ed captain Eccle|&s;ton, though arre&s;ted for the &s;ame fact.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="016334_0046_0F9C26F6C3C7C9E8">Captain Norwood objects to the te&s;timony of major Hitchcock, as containing nothing which re&s;pects the charges exhibited again&s;t him before this court.

<P>The court having con&s;idered the objection of captain Norwood and the te&s;timony of major Hitchcock, are of o|pinion, that, as it appears from the te&s;timony of captain Brice that the relea&s;ement of captain Eccle&s;ton from his arre&s;t con&s;titutes a part of that partiality with which cap|tain Norwood accu&s;es general Smallwood, an enquiry into that fact comes with propriety from this court, and they do determine that the te&s;timony of major Hitchcock &s;hall remain on their proceedings.</P>

<P>Captain Ghi&s;elin and captain Baytop took the places of captain Hinds and captain Davis, and were &s;worn agreea|ble to the articles of war. The proceedings of ye&s;terday were read to them. Colonel Woolford was again adduced to the court as a witne&s;s, and was a&s;ked the following que&s;tions:</P>
<P>Que&s;tion by the court at the reque&s;t of general Small|wood. Do you remember the day that you, at the reque&s;t of captain Eccle&s;ton, applied to general Smallwood to have <HI>him</HI> relea&s;ed from his arre&s;t?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. It was the day preceding that on which the ge|neral relea&s;ed him.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion by the court at the reque&s;t of general Small|wood. What did general Smallwood &s;ay to you on your ap|plication in favour of captain Eccle&s;ton, with re&s;pect to that gentleman's relea&s;ement?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. He &s;aid that he had no other motive for arre&s;t|ing captains Norwood and Eccle&s;ton but to convince them of their error, and to prevent the &s;ervice from being in|jured in future by a &s;imilar conduct; that &s;ince captain Eccle&s;ton was &s;en&s;ible he had been wrong, if he would ac|knowledge it in writing, he (general Smallwood) would relea&s;e him, the general wi&s;hed the acknowledgment to be made in writing, that it might ju&s;tify him in di&s;charging Captain Eccle&s;ton from his arre&s;t.</P>
<P>The following witne&s;&s;es appeared at the reque&s;t of cap|tain Norwood.</P>
<P>Captain Oldham depo&s;es and &s;ays, That captains Nor|wood and Eccle&s;ton were arre&s;ted at Chad's-Ford for the &s;ame crime, they were each brought before a court-mar|tial, and each plead guilty to their charge. After cap|tain Norwood had made his defence, the court a&s;ked cap|tain Eccle&s;ton if it was &s;ufficient for him, he replied that it was. Almo&s;t immediately a note was given to the pre|&s;ident, which relea&s;ed captain Eccle&s;ton from his arre&s;t. The court then proceeded on the trial of captain Norwood;
<PB N="48" REF="016334_0048_0F9C26F8439D6658">
in &s;ome little time general Smallwood came into the room &s;ome of the court ob&s;erved to him, that they were deter|mining on captain Norwood's ca&s;e, the general &s;ignified a de&s;ire to hear the proceedings of the court, with captain Norwood's defence, read, this was done, he conceived that &s;ome part of captain Norwood's defence reflected on his conduct, and in&s;i&s;ting upon having a defence again&s;t tho&s;e reflections entered; the propriety of entering &s;uch a defence on the proceedings of the court, as captain Nor|wood had been already tried &s;o far as to be found guilty of the charge, was objected to by &s;everal members; at this general Smallwood grew exceedingly warm, &s;ignified that &s;ome of the court were partial, and farther &s;aid, that if his defence was not entered with the proceedings, and opinion given on the whole, he would di&s;&s;olve the court and take Norwood to head quarters for trial; he far|ther in&s;i&s;ted that the pre&s;ident &s;hould inform him by a note in the next room, where he would &s;tay, whether his defence &s;hould be entered or not; the court were of opini|on that the general's defence, with his evidences, &s;hould be entered, and opinion given conjointly on the whole.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion by the court. Who was to pro&s;ecute captains Eccle&s;ton and Norwood?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. I conceived that the judge-advocate, or per&s;on officiating as &s;uch, was to pro&s;ecute them.</P>

<P>Que&s;tion by the court. Was general Smallwood informed that the court had met before they proceeded on the trials of captains Norwood and Eccle&s;ton?</P>

<P>Que&s;tion by the court. What induced the court to pro|ceed on tho&s;e trials without giving general Smallwood no|tice of their intentions?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. I conceived and believe the court thought, that as tho&s;e gentlemen plead guilty to their charges, te&s;timony again&s;t them was unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>

<P>Que&s;tion by the court at the reque&s;t of general Small|wood. Did general Smallwood make application to the court for evidence to be taken in behalf of the United States?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. I think the general reque&s;ted that his witne&s;&s;es &s;hould be examined, but I believed tho&s;e witne&s;&s;es were only to exculpate him&s;elf from tho&s;e reflections which cap|tain Norwood, in his defence, had ca&s;t on him, as I did not conceive evidences in behalf of the United States ne|ce&s;&s;ary, when captain Norwood plead guilty to his charge.</P>

<P>An&s;wer. No, I believe the court had &s;entenced him to be reprimanded, but had not determined in what manner.</P>

<P>Que&s;tion by the court at the reque&s;t of general Small|wood. Did captain Norwood object, the &s;econd day, to the court's determining on the proceedings at large?</P>

<P>Captain Bell depo&s;es and &s;ays, That, at Chad's Ford, when captains Norwood and Eccle&s;ton were arre&s;ted by general Smallwood, a court was called for the purpo&s;e of trying them; the court met at the time appointed, and, after being properly prepared, a&s;ked captains Norwood and Eccle&s;ton, Whether they plead guilty to their charges. They replied in the affirmative. Captain Norwood's wit|ne&s;&s;es were examined, after which he gave in a defence. Captain Eccle&s;ton's defence was the &s;ame as captain Nor|wood's. Ju&s;t then captain Eccle&s;ton received a note, which he read and pre&s;ented to the pre&s;ident: he was by that note relea&s;ed from his arre&s;t; the deponent thinks be then left the room. The court had found captain Norwood guilty of di&s;obedience of orders, and were proceeding to determine on his puni&s;hment, when general Smallwood came into the room, and de&s;ired that the proceedings of the court &s;hould be read; after hearing them, the general conceived, that what captain Norwood had &s;aid reflected on him, and begged leave to offer &s;omething in ju&s;tifica|tion of him&s;elf; this the court granted; general Small|wood's evidence and defence were taken down; &s;ome words pa&s;&s;ed between him and captain Norwood, the de|ponent does not recollect them. After this captain Nor|wood &s;poke to the court, and indicated his hopes, that they would not con&s;ider general Smallwood's evidence and defence conjointly with his. General Smallwood was then going out of the room; on hearing what captain Norwood &s;aid, he returned, was very angry, and told the court that he would not be <HI>baffled</HI> by them; that it was in his power to di&s;&s;olve the court and, &s;ince he found that they were inclined to <HI>baffle</HI> him, he would di&s;&s;olved it and have cap|tain

Norwood tried at head quarters. The general added, That he perceived &s;ome of the court were inclined to act partially, and de&s;ired the pre&s;ident to &s;ignify, by a note to him in the next room, whether they would give their opi|nion on his evidence conjointly with captain Norwood's or not; the court informed him that they would, and thus put an end to the di&s;pute.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion by the court. Were captains Norwood and Ec|cle&s;ton tried together or &s;eparately?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. I think they were tried together.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion by the court. Did the court a&s;k whether they cho&s;e to be tried together or &s;eparately?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. I do not recollect that they did.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion by the court. Did the gentlemen reque&s;t to be tried together?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. I do not recollect that they did.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion by the court at the reque&s;t of general Small|wood. Did general Smallwood give in a defence to the court?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. He gave the court his rea&s;ons for arre&s;ting captain Norwood, and for ordering captains to be relieved by &s;ubalterns.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion by the court at the reque&s;t of general Small|wood. When captain Norwood indicated his hopes that the court would not con&s;ider the evidences produced by general Smallwood, did any members object to a con&s;ider|ation of the te&s;timony offered by the general?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. A di&s;pute aro&s;e in court about the propriety of admitting the witne&s;&s;es offered by the general.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion by the court at the reque&s;t of general Small|wood. Was there a great heat in the court publicly, on that matter?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. There were high di&s;putes.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion by the court at the reque&s;t of general Small|wood. Had general Smallwood any intimation of the court's proceeding on the trials of captains Norwood and Eccle&s;ton before they did proceed?</P>

<P>Que&s;tion by the court at the reque&s;t of general Small|wood. Was there any difference between general Small|wood and captain Norwood previous to this trial?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. I think there was.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion by the court at the reque&s;t of general Small|wood. What was it?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. While the divi&s;ion lay at Wilmington, one of the officers had touched on the general's character; this occa&s;ioned him to call the officers together at his quarters, where he began to <HI>clear up</HI> the charges which had been &s;aid again&s;t him; in clearing them up, high di&s;putes a|ro&s;e, particularly between the general and captain Nor|wood, concerning the u&s;age of &s;oldiers, and other mat|ters. Captain Norwood &s;aid, that be would <HI>always</HI> make a point of &s;triking any &s;oldier who gave him ill language; the general replied, then he would <HI>always</HI> make a point of arre&s;ting him.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion by the court at the reque&s;t of general Small|wood. Did the di&s;pute between general Smallwood and captain Norwood amount to a quarrel, or was it only a difference in &s;entiment?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. It was a difference in &s;entiment.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion by the court. Was this difference of &s;entiment carried on with warmth on each &s;ide?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. They were not very warm, but there was a de|gree of warmth.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion by the court. Did you ever hear captain Nor|wood, previous to his arre&s;t at Chad's-Ford, &s;ay that ge|neral Smallwood was a partial man and no gentleman?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. No.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion by the pri&s;oner. Did the general give in his <HI>defence</HI> the day that I plead to the charge, or was it the day after?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. I do not recollect.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion by the pri&s;oner. Did the court meet one or two days?</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="016334_0054_0F9C26FCC31CD060">An&s;wer. Two days.</P>
<P>Lieutenant Smith depo&s;es and &s;ays, That, when Cap|tains Norwood and Eccle&s;ton were arre&s;ted at Chad's-Ford, they each appeared at a court of which he was a member. Captain Norwood gave in a defence, which captain Eccle|&s;ton &s;aid was &s;ufficient for him. At this time captain Ec|cle&s;ton gave a note to the pre&s;ident, which the court thought &s;ufficient to relea&s;e him from his arre&s;t. They then cleared the room, and proceeded to pa&s;&s;ing &s;entence on captain Norwood; they had found him guilty and or|dered him to be reprimanded, but had not entered their determination on their proceedings, when general Small|wood came into the room. The deponent informed the general, that the court were then determining on captain Norwood's ca&s;e; he reque&s;ted to hear the proceedings of the court, with captain Norwood's defence; after hearing them, he informed the court, that he had <HI>&s;ome</HI> evidences to bring in again&s;t <HI>&s;ome</HI> reflections thrown out in captain Norwood's defence. Some of the court objected to the propriety of his bringing in witne&s;&s;es after they had begun to determine on the ca&s;e. Without coming to any re&s;olu|tion, the court adjourned till next day. Then general Smallwood in&s;i&s;ted on introducing his witne&s;&s;es, and the court granted his reque&s;t. After his witne&s;&s;es were heard, he harangued the court him&s;elf, and gave them his rea&s;ons for relea&s;ing captain Eccle&s;ton and not captain Norwood. After this captain Norwood ob&s;erved, that he thought it would be improper to give their opinion on the proceed|ings of the two days <HI>together,</HI> and left the room. The ge|neral immediately <HI>fell in a pa&s;&s;ion,</HI> and in&s;i&s;ted on its being done, as he had not been pre&s;ent the day before, and had it not in his power to bring in his witne&s;&s;es. This occa|&s;ioned much confu&s;ion in the court, in the cour&s;e of which general Smallwood &s;aid he did not doubt but &s;ome of the court were not partial. He likewi&s;e in&s;i&s;ted, that the pre|&s;ident &s;hould &s;ignify, by a note to him in tne next room, whether they would con&s;ider the proceedings of the two
<PB N="55" REF="016334_0055_0F9C26FD83313AF0">
days conjointly. The court gratified him. General Smallwood had called this court, and appointed the hour at which they were to meet; they were to have met about two hours and a half before the general came; it was ob|&s;erved by &s;ome of the court, that it was unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;end for the general, as he knew the time the court was to meet, which time was elap&s;ed, and as the gentlemen would plead guilty to the charges again&s;t them, for which rea&s;ons it was imagined that there was no occa&s;ion for witne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion by the court. When the court knew that cap|tain Norwood had a defence to give in, did they inform general Smallwood of it?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. Not to my knowledge.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion by the court at the reque&s;t of general Small|wood. Did captain Eccle&s;ton receive the note which re|lea&s;ed him from his arre&s;t in court?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. He received a note which I &s;uppo&s;ed to be his relea&s;ement in court, in the mid&s;t of captain Norwood's defence; from the manner of bringing it, the note ap|peared to have been &s;ent in a hurry?</P>
<P>Que&s;tion by the court at the reque&s;t of general Small|wood. Was that note read to the court?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. Yes.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion by the court at the reque&s;t of general Small|wood. Had any evidence been offered by captain Norwood when the court proceeded to determine in his ca&s;e?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. Not that I recollect.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion by the court at the reque&s;t of general Small|wood. How long had the court &s;at before general Small|wood came?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. I do not remember, but from the proceedings I imagine they mu&s;t have &s;et an hour or an hour and a half.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion by the court at the reque&s;t of general Small|wood. Did general Smallwood a&s;&s;ign any rea&s;on for his not attending &s;ooner?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. I believe he did after the proceedings of the court were read to him.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="016334_0056_0F9C26FE44D5A008">Que&s;tion by the court at the reque&s;t of general Small|wood. What were tho&s;e rea&s;ons?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. I think he &s;aid there were &s;ome pri&s;oners in the main guard whom he had to &s;end to Lanca&s;ter.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion by the pri&s;oner. Were captain Eccle&s;ton and my&s;elf both arre&s;ted for the &s;ame crime?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. As well as I can recollect you were.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion by the pri&s;oner. Did captain Eccle&s;ton and my&s;elf both plead guilty to the &s;ame charge?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. You did.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion by the pri&s;oner. Did I give in a ju&s;tification or defence?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. You acknowledged the fact, and gave your rea&s;ons for acting in the manner you had.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion by the court at the reque&s;t of general Small|wood. Do you remember the rea&s;ons general Smallwood gave the court for relea&s;ing captain Eccle&s;ton and not cap|tain Norwood?</P>
<P>An&s;wer. He &s;aid that captain Eccle&s;ton had acknow|ledged his fault; he added, that if captain Eccle&s;ton had not done this, and captain Norwood had, he would have relea&s;ed captain Norwood and would have pro&s;ecuted cap|tain Eccle&s;ton.</P>
<P>The court adjourns till the day after to-morrow 9 o'clock.</P>
<P>The movements of the army prevented the court from meeting till Saturday, September 19, 1778, when the court met at Salem, and proceeded to a farther inve&s;tigati|on of the charges exhibited again&s;t captain Norwood.</P>
<P>The depo&s;ition of captain Eccle&s;ton, taken by the judge advocate in pre&s;ence of general Smallwood and captain Norwood, was read to the court, and admitted as evidence.</P>
<P>The depo&s;ition was as follows: Captain Eccle&s;ton de|po&s;es and &s;ays, That he has never heard captain Norwood &s;ay any thing comprehended in the charges for which he is now in arre&s;t.</P>
<P>The following que&s;tions were a&s;ked by general Small|wood and captain Norwood.</P>

high an opinion of, under an arre&s;t, and I am per&s;uaded, had you exerci&s;ed your own judgment, you would not have fallen into the error. Combinations in an army have a dangerous tendency, even when they are concerted on ju&s;t principles, but an officer &s;hould be extremely cautious how he enters into them when not ju&s;tly grounded, and a com|manding officer mu&s;t be lo&s;t to all &s;en&s;e of honour and du|ty who does not check and di&s;countenance &s;uch mea&s;ures in every in&s;tance, and more particularly in the fir&s;t.

<P>Captain David&s;on depo&s;es and &s;ays, That in the court-martial called at Chad's-Ford, for the trials of captains Norwood and Eccle&s;ton, captain Norwood accu&s;ed general Smallwood with acting partially, in relea&s;ing captain Ec|cle&s;ton from his arre&s;t and pro&s;ecuting <HI>him</HI> on the &s;ame charge; the general replied, that he relea&s;ed captain Ec|cle&s;ton on the application made to him by that gentleman's friends, and that he was ever willing to di&s;charge from his arre&s;t, an officer who was convinced of his having been in an error. The court had determined on the ca&s;e of cap|tain Norwood without hearing the witne&s;&s;es to be adduced by general Smallwood, and had adjourned till next day; then the general attended with his witne&s;&s;es, in&s;i&s;ted on

Soon after the court &s;at, captain Eccle&s;ton, who was charged with the &s;ame facts, received a relea&s;e from his arre&s;t. The court then proceeded on the trial of captain Norwood. He was &s;entenced to be privately reprimanded by the com|manding officer of the regiment to which he belonged. Previous to this, &s;everal gentlemen, one of whom was the deponent, had applied to general Smallwood in favour of captain Eccle&s;ton; the deponent had reque&s;ted captain Eccle&s;ton to make &s;ome acknowledgment of his fault, and the captain replied that he would.

On the morning of captain Norwood's trial general Smallwood wrote to cap|tain Eccle&s;ton, the captain returned a note to the general, in which, as well as the deponent can recollect, he ac|knowledged him&s;elf convinced that he had been in an error.</P>

<P>To the fir&s;t two charges I have already refu&s;ed to plead and find my objection entered on your proceedings, though over-ruled. I &s;hall therefore only, on that head, remark that I flatter my&s;elf his Excellency will do me the ju&s;tice to believe, when he &s;ees my objection, that it did not pro|ceed from any di&s;re&s;pect to his orders, but from a tho|rough conviction that I could not with propriety be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> twice for the &s;ame offence.

<PB N="71" REF="016334_0071_0F9C26DB052F4D10">
letter to captain Eccle&s;ton&mdash;a letter which pretty plainly proves the general wi&s;hed to di&s;criminate between us, though we both &s;tood charged with the &s;ame offence; o|therways I am at a lo&s;s to know what the general means by &s;aying, "I am per&s;uaded had you exerci&s;ed your own judgment, you would not have fallen into the error; com|binations in an army have a dangerous tendency," &amp;c. What inference can be drawn from this, but that the ge|neral &s;uppo&s;ed I had bia&s;&s;ed captain Eccle&s;ton, or at lea&s;t that I was in a combination again&s;t him. Charges which he can by no means prove, nor had he a right to infer, without confe&s;&s;ing his partial conduct merited &s;uch combi|nations. However, the general, pa&s;&s;ing by the expre&s;&s;ive language of his letter, wi&s;hes to e&s;tabli&s;h the grounds of captain Eccle&s;ton's di&s;charge on the application of the cap|tain's friends&mdash;a &s;hallow pretext at be&s;t, e&s;pecially when &s;uch application was not made at the in&s;tance of captain Eccle&s;ton, though the general has attempted to prove, by his artful &s;ifting and extorting the matter of evidence, the application to him on captain Eccle&s;ton's behalf was at the captain's &s;pecial in&s;tance and prior to his, the ge|neral's, letter. Colonel Adams, it is true, &s;wears that captain Eccle&s;ton did apply to him to intercede with the general, but does not &s;ay it was prior to the general's let|ter; and indeed it appears it was not; for at the time of the conver&s;ation, captain Eccle&s;ton told colonel Adams he was going to write to the general, or that he would write, and accordingly did; but it was at the pre&s;&s;ing invitation contained in the general's own letter. With regard to co|lonel Woolford's and major Muir's te&s;timonies, I beg leave to be &s;ilent, becau&s;e, relying as I mu&s;t do on the&s;e gen|tlemens honours, the only con&s;truction I &s;hall venture to put on their te&s;timonies is, that probably they have forgot, or were mi&s;taken, as captain Eccle&s;ton remembers no &s;uch application, and it is &s;carcely probable the captain would ungratefully forget the mighty boon the colonel had ob|tained for him; and in his own te&s;timony, as he would

not contradict the colonel, he only mode&s;tly declares, that he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oes not remember any &s;uch application, but very well remembers he t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> me, at the time of his receiving the general's letter, that he had made no application to the general him&s;elf, nor had he got any per&s;on to do it for him; nor indeed does it appear he ever intended it, or 'tis highly probable major Steward would have been the per|&s;on to whom he would have applied for interce&s;&s;ion, as he was the fir&s;t per&s;on he had advi&s;ed with in his dilemma Colonel Ford well remembers his conver&s;ation with cap|tain Eccle&s;ton, which might have been prior to the cap|tain's receipt of the general's letter. It is true, in that conver&s;ation the captain confe&s;&s;es he thought him&s;elf wrong, but expre&s;&s;ed not the lea&s;t de&s;ire to u&s;e colonel Ford's intere&s;t in his di&s;charge, neither did he intimate the &s;malle&s;t de&s;ire to be relea&s;ed from his arre&s;t, till he had received the general's letter. Here indeed, were I to make a compari&s;on between captain Eccle&s;ton's conduct and my own, I might, without partiality, charge him with the highe&s;t degree of criminality, as he per&s;i&s;ted in a known error, and I ignorantly per&s;i&s;ted, in &s;pite of pride and oppre&s;&s;ion, in what I thought was right.&mdash;I &s;hall now take leave of the evidence adduced in this pre&s;ent trial, and once more turn back to remark on the general's conduct in cour&s;e of my three &s;everal arre&s;ts under his per&s;ecution.

charge, and the court was &s;itting on the nature of my of|fence, and on the mode of my puni&s;hment, and finding upon the whole it was mo&s;t probable his malevolent inten|tions would not be gratified, threatened to di&s;&s;olve the court unle&s;s they would hear him and enter his defence among their proceedings. Whether this harangue had any effect on the court or no, I won't undertake to &s;ay, but this I may venture to &s;ay, that general Smallwood is the fir&s;t commander in chief of any department, who has taken on him&s;elf the peculiar province of deputy judge-advocate, and commenced pro&s;ecutor in a court where he &s;hould always be reluctantly drawn even as an evidence. On my &s;econd trial, and on the &s;ame charges for which I now &s;tand, in &s;pite of general Smallwood's wi&s;h to crimi|nate me on the two fir&s;t articles, the court ju&s;tly acquitted me of intentional guilt, though, as the words might carry the implied tendency, they &s;entenced me to a reprimand in general orders; and on the third charge they thought them&s;elves incompetent to judge. Which &s;entence it plea&s;ed his Excellency to di&s;approve, though I have the happine&s;s to find, by a letter his Excellency did me the honour to write me, that he entirely acquitted me of in|tentionally reflecting on him&s;elf.</P>
<P>On the third court, the one before which I now &s;tand, you know your&s;elves the eagerne&s;s with which the general as endeavoured to criminate me, but, con&s;cious of my truth and integrity, I can rely with the mo&s;t &s;ettled com|po&s;ure on your unbia&s;&s;ed judgment, from a firm belief, that no gentlemen, convinced as I flatter my&s;elf you are of the prejudice and &s;ettled rancour of general Smallwood, will not condemn me for &s;peaking of that prejudice and rancour with &s;ome degree of a&s;perity.</P>

<P>THE unju&s;t and unmerited a&s;per&s;ions ca&s;t out in a public manner by captain Norwood again&s;t my conduct and to the prejudice of my character, whil&s;t acting officially in the di&s;charge of my duty, induces me to ri&s;e and claim the indulgence of the court a few minutes, to recapitulate and &s;et in a more comprehen&s;ive view, and clear point of light, my conduct and character, which I flatter my&s;elf are &s;o fully &s;upported and ju&s;tified by unque&s;tionable te&s;ti|mony, adduced &s;o clearly in point on the occa&s;ion, that a farther illu&s;tration would &s;eem unnece&s;&s;ary; but as it is the fir&s;t in&s;tance through a various life, in which I have been employed in a public capacity from my earlie&s;t man|hood, that ever my public or private character has been &s;truck at, hope my anxiety to &s;et my reputation in the cleare&s;t light may plead an excu&s;e for the intru&s;ion.</P>
<P>In the ca&s;e of captain Norwood's trial at Chad's-Ford, for a mo&s;t glaring breach of orders, (the proceedings on which have been exhibited to the pre&s;ent court-martial) it is obvious, from the te&s;timony of colonel Woolford, co|lonel Ford, major Howard, and brigade-major Hitchcock, (particularly the latter, who from his po&s;t mu&s;t have been be&s;t acquainted with the detail of that part of the army)
<PB N="75" REF="016334_0075_0F9C26DE0371E1B8">
that my orders, i&s;&s;ued through the brigade-major, were regular, and ought to have been obligatory, becau&s;e the &s;ervice required it; and the&s;e gentlemen prove to demon|&s;tration, that the duty could be complied with in no other manner than was directed by tho&s;e orders, without the highe&s;t inju&s;tice to both field and &s;ubaltern officers at that po&s;t; but captain Norwood not only refu&s;ed to comply with the order, but plead guilty, and &s;trenuou&s;ly urged he could ju&s;tify his conduct, in that ca&s;e there could have been no mi&s;repre&s;entation of his conduct, as he &s;o ungen|teelly and unju&s;tly a&s;&s;erts; the court found him guilty of all he was charged with, and &s;entenced him to be private|ly reprimanded by the commanding officer of his regiment, which, with the proceedings, were tran&s;mitted to general Wa&s;hington for his con&s;ideration, and from the face of the proceedings, his Excellency di&s;approved the &s;entence, and cen&s;ured captain Norwood in the following terms: "The commander in chief utterly di&s;approves the &s;entence, as al|together inadequate to the offence, the mutinous and dan|gerous &s;pirit which actuated captain Norwood, in his opi|nion, merited the mo&s;t exemplary puni&s;hment." Notwith|&s;tanding &s;o fragrant a violation of a general order, calcu|lated to aid the &s;ervice, and his ob&s;tinate ju&s;tification of his conduct, captain Norwood is at a lo&s;s to account for the cen&s;ure pa&s;&s;ed on him, unle&s;s general Smallwood had mi&s;|repre&s;ented facts, and therefore publicly declares, without farther enquiry, or even that re&s;erve and delicacy which &s;hould ever mark the conduct and character of an officer and a gentleman, that he does not regard the cen&s;ure of the commander in chief, becau&s;e general Smallwood had mi&s;repre&s;ented facts to him.</P>
<P>Captain Norwood was charged for refu&s;ing to comply with a general order, i&s;&s;ued expre&s;sly for the purpo&s;e of relieving the troops on piquet, founded in the nece&s;&s;ity of the ca&s;e, and which at that period could not otherwi&s;e be remedied, plead guilty to the charge, but urged in his de|fence, that the nece&s;&s;ity comprehended in the latter part of
<PB N="76" REF="016334_0076_0F9C26DEC36045E8">
the charge did not exi&s;t, notwith&s;tanding the te&s;timony of the above gentlemen proved the fact, and the propriety of this and every part of the charge, to demon&s;tration, pur&s;u|ant to which the court found him guilty, and &s;entenced him; it mu&s;t therefore appear very extraordinary that I could mi&s;repre&s;ent facts, when the court found him guilty of every fact with which he was charged, and proceeded to &s;entence him thereon as above, which the commander in chief utterly di&s;approved, as altogether inadequate to the offence; then what other inference could be deduced, but that the fallacy and ab&s;urdity of his a&s;&s;ertion is too glaring to require a &s;olid reply, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> it refutes it&s;elf, and clearly points out that it is utterly void of foundation.</P>
<P>This a&s;&s;ertion of the captain's does not only convey an ab&s;olute reflection on my character, but has an implied tendency to reflect on the commander in chief, as it mu&s;t be inferred, if the captain's words have any meaning at all, that his Excellency decided upon my mi&s;repre&s;entation, as he &s;tiles it, and not on the proceedings of the court-mar|tial, which would have been a manife&s;t deviation from that line of conduct, and love of ju&s;tice, which have ever mo&s;t eminently influenced and di&s;tingui&s;hed his character; but, &s;ays captain Norwood, I had no intention to reflect on his Excellency, I meant only to reflect on general Small|wood; in public a&s;&s;ertions and declarations of this nature, a man, even of captain Norwood's &s;en&s;e, certainly would not wi&s;h to place him&s;elf in the light of an ideot, who has no meaning annexed to his words; but the captain, if he is capable of rational reflection, mu&s;t know it is not his intention, but his expre&s;&s;ions, which mu&s;t affect and wound characters, therefore it becomes his duty, as an officer and a gentleman, nay, I might add&punc; as an hone&s;t citizen, to be more guarded in his expre&s;&s;ions, for it is tho&s;e only, in ca&s;es of &s;lander (and not his intention) which he is amena|ble for, and to be criminated by, unle&s;s he could e&s;tabli&s;h his favourite po&s;ition, in that in&s;tance he might indeed &s;trike at characters at large with impunity.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="016334_0077_0F9C26DF839C7040">A drunken man is puni&s;hed for &s;aying and doing things which he might perhaps with more propriety urge (as the captain does) he did not mean to &s;ay or do; in like man|ner, if captain Norwood's petulancy excites him to revile characters, he is an&s;werable for his unju&s;t a&s;&s;ertions, and not for his intentions: Lea&s;t the court &s;hould think I dwell too long on this part of the charge, I will tre&s;pa&s;s no longer than to ob&s;erve, that this a&s;&s;ertion of the captain's is not only unju&s;t, but &s;uch as he has not pretended to &s;up|port, nor can he ju&s;tify it upon any principle whatever, his conduct therefore has certainly been unbecoming an officer and a gentleman, by unju&s;tly &s;ugge&s;ting in public, that I had mi&s;repre&s;ented facts to general Wa&s;hington, which is not only a reflection on my character, but has an implied tendency to reflect on the commander in chief, and therefore make no doubt that the court, in this in|&s;tance, will find him guilty, and &s;entence him according to his demerit.</P>
<P>Captain Norwood has al&s;o publicly a&s;&s;erted, that I have been guilty of partiality in his ca&s;e, and that I am not a gentleman, and lea&s;t the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions &s;hould not have their full force and weight in that in&s;tance, he farther declares, that he would make it his particular duty to declare pub|licly in all companies that he &s;hould come into, that I was a partial man and no gentleman; the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions have been proved by captain Brice and lieutenant Baily, but the captain contending publicly before the pre&s;ent and late court, whereof colonel Hazen was pre&s;ident, that he could ju&s;tify tho&s;e charges, renders the proof of the&s;e officers un|nece&s;&s;ary; the charges are high and attrocious, the latter general and indefinite, and of &s;uch a nature, if ju&s;tified, as mu&s;t for ever bla&s;t and &s;tamp the blacke&s;t infamy on the character of an officer, and the charge, if not &s;upported, mu&s;t be rendered &s;till more flagrant, by being levelled at his com|manding officer when in the official di&s;charge of his duty; then how extremely cautious &s;hould the captain have been in thus venturing to ruin for ever the character of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;u|perior,

acting in the line of his duty. The latter charge, the mo&s;t infamous and injurious, he has adduced no te&s;timony in &s;upport of, yet I re&s;t a&s;&s;ured the court will con&s;ider its malignancy, and inflict an adequate and ex|emplary puni&s;hment, at pre&s;ent it requires no other notice from me but contempt, and the former he endeavours to &s;upport by adducing evidence to prove I was partial in re|lieving captain Eccle&s;ton from his arre&s;t and pro&s;ecuting him on the &s;ame charge, but his witne&s;&s;es only tend more clearly to prove his ob&s;tinately per&s;i&s;ting in an error, and attempting to the la&s;t to ju&s;tify his refractory conduct, and in&s;tead of e&s;tabli&s;hing, combine more &s;trongly with other te&s;timony, to refute and fal&s;ify his a&s;&s;ertions, which when he finds he cannot ju&s;tify, actuated by the &s;ame principle of inju&s;tice, and a degree of ca&s;ui&s;try peculiar to men of his ca&s;t, attempts to extort from his evidences that I ac|cu&s;ed the court at Chad's-Ford of partiality, and threaten|ed to di&s;&s;olve them, as if this procedure was any way con|nected with his unju&s;t a&s;per&s;ions, but colonel Adams, who was pre&s;ident of that court, and who&s;e duty it was upon &s;o ungenteel an accu&s;ation to have reprehended me, and who mo&s;t probably, from that con&s;ideration, mu&s;t have remem|bered the circum&s;tance, proves to demon&s;tration that no &s;uch accu&s;ation was made, but on the contrary, that I in|&s;i&s;ted on the court to determine on the evidence at large on both &s;ides, and not partially, which, when captain Norwood objected to, and two members, who are now his principal evidences, ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to include and de|termine on, then, and not till then, was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;yllable men|tioned about di&s;&s;olving the court, as will appear by recur|ring to colonel Adams's depo&s;ition.

In ju&s;tification of his a&s;&s;ertion, and to fit the charge of partiality in this in&s;tance, he has a&s;&s;erted
<PB N="79" REF="016334_0079_0F9C26E103D5B468">
and to the la&s;t in&s;i&s;ted on it, that the letter I wrote captain Eccle&s;ton was prior to any application made for and on his behalf, and was concerted to court him to make conce&s;&s;i|ons, as he phra&s;es it, though no &s;uch were ever required from either, as will appear from captain Eccle&s;ton's te&s;ti|mony and the letter it&s;elf, and notwith&s;tanding I have re|peatedly gave him my word of honour I had no &s;uch mo|tive, and that I could prove by the te&s;timony of colonels Woolford, Adams, Ford, majors Steward and Muir, that &s;uch application had been made, previous to my writing that letter, and that I required and received an acknow|ledgment in writing from captain Eccle&s;ton before he could be or was relieved from his arre&s;t, yet the&s;e declarations, &s;olemn and &s;acred as they were, have been di&s;regarded, and I believe I might ju&s;tly add, di&s;credited, till the fact was &s;o po&s;itively proved by the&s;e gentlemens te&s;timonies; but the captain now &s;ays; I have been deceived, my evi|dences have not proved what they informed me they could; I readily grant that the captain may have been made a a cat's-paw of, perhaps to &s;erve the &s;ecret purpo&s;es of more de&s;igning men, who may have had too much art and low cunning to &s;tand forth them&s;elves, but the captain's want of under&s;tanding and di&s;cernment to avoid their &s;nares, certainly does not ju&s;tify his unju&s;t and illiberal reflections on my conduct and character.</P>
<P>Does not captain Norwood therefore merit the mo&s;t ex|emplary puni&s;hment, by ob&s;tinately per&s;i&s;ting in his errors, and being influenced by the a&s;&s;ertions and per&s;ua&s;ions of his &s;uppo&s;ed friends, after I had repeatedly pledged him my honour that application had been made on behalf and by the reque&s;t of captain Eccle&s;ton before I wrote him the terms on which he would be relea&s;ed and that before I relea&s;ed him from his arre&s;t I received his acknowledgment in writing, and further, that had he made an acknow|ledgment of his error, and Eccle&s;ton declined it, I would have relea&s;ed him and pro&s;ecuted Eccle&s;ton; can the cap|tain then after this plead an excu&s;e for propagating his

And in that in&s;tance is not the offence doubly ag|gravated? And will not the mo&s;t diligent and active officers in the &s;ervice be mo&s;t expo&s;ed to &s;uch illiberal attacks? Then may we not bid adieu to good order and di&s;cipline which is &s;o &s;alutary, and without which no army can long exi&s;t?</P>
<P>But the captain, after he finds he can no longer ju&s;tify his a&s;&s;ertions, &s;urmi&s;es I have been right, and he now has no|thing to blame me for, but not calling upon him for an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|clairci&s;&s;ment of his a&s;&s;ertions before I arre&s;ted him; had I de&s;cended, after what is above recited, to make advance towards an explanation, then indeed the captain him&s;elf with propriety might have urged, that I came within the de&s;cription of his la&s;t a&s;&s;ertion.</P>

<P>_IN the beginning of captain Norwood's defence he &s;ays, "It is with plea&s;ure I find this very extraordinary trial drawing to a conclu&s;ion&mdash;a trial which, when traced back to its fir&s;t prin|ciples, will be found more replete with male|volence and per&s;ecution, than perhaps can be parallelled in any military proce&s;s in a free country&mdash;and with per|mi&s;&s;ion of this court, I will endeavour to trace to its foun|dation the principles on which, and inve&s;tigate the cau&s;e why, I have been cruelly kept in arre&s;t, and dragged from court to court for near four months."</P>
<P>Here I would beg leave to remark, that the captain mu&s;t entertain a high opinion of his own importance, becau&s;e I would not &s;uffer him with impunity to commit a breach of orders, and revile my character, he therefore roundly a&s;|&s;erts, and looks upon my pro&s;ecution to obtain ju&s;tice and &s;et my reputation in a clear light, to be dictated by malice and a &s;pirit of per&s;ecution&mdash;his &s;trange incon&s;i&s;tency and want of candour mu&s;t appear in a very &s;triking light, from the following certificate under the hand of major Muir, the facts recited in which occurred immediately after the

witne&s;&s;es had all been examined, the proceedings clo&s;ed, and a time limited for him to bring in his defence.</P>
<P>After the witne&s;&s;es had all appeared, and had all been examined before the court, and a certain time given to captain Norwood to make his defence, in pa&s;&s;ing towards the door with my&s;elf, he exclaimed, that it was very &s;ur|pri&s;ing!&mdash;that he believed they had been trying to put the general and him&s;elf by the ears, and that had it not been for two or three per&s;ons, he believed they would have been friends now. I ob&s;erved he (captain Norwood) had been mi&s;informed; he &s;aid he had, and that his witne&s;&s;es had not &s;upported what they informed him they could.&mdash;I made an&s;wer, the general was not to blame as to that, for application was made to him by &s;everal before captain Eccle&s;ton was relea&s;ed from his arre&s;t&mdash;he replied, he did not blame the general &s;o much now, but from the repre|&s;entation made to him by captain Eccle&s;ton, who informed him that he ever did make conce&s;&s;ions, acknowledge him|&s;elf in fault, or make application to be relea&s;ed from his arre&s;t, nor reque&s;ted of any per&s;on to make application for him, that I, or any judicious or impartial man, would think the general partial, by relea&s;ing Eccle&s;ton and pro|&s;ecuting him on the &s;ame charge, and a&s;ked me, if it had been my ca&s;e, whether I &s;hould not have thought the &s;ame? I an&s;wered him, relying on captain Eccle&s;ton's re|pre&s;entation, it's very probable I &s;hould, but I was &s;orry he did not make farther enquiry, or come to an explana|tion, when he mentioned it to the general at Chad's-Ford, and the general gave him his word of honour that applica|tion was made to him before he relea&s;ed Eccle&s;ton from his arre&s;t&mdash;he &s;aid he did not believe the general, as Ec|cle&s;ton had &s;o po&s;itively a&s;&s;ured him to the contrary, and that from the intimacy &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between them, and the good opinion he entertained of him, he could not doubt the truth of what he had a&s;&s;erted, but he &s;aid he &s;hould ever be of opinion that the general had a private pique a|gain&s;t him; I a&s;&s;ured him I did not think &s;o, for I had

<P>I &s;hall leave the public to judge from his &s;elf conviction expre&s;&s;ed to major Muir at the above time, what princi|ples he mu&s;t have been actuated by, in dictating his de|fence, fraught with illiberal abu&s;e and wanton &s;currility, beyond what was contained in his original a&s;&s;ertions, on which he was pro&s;ecuted; he al&s;o in&s;i&s;ts I have had a pri|vate pique again&s;t him&mdash;Has he through the cour&s;e of the pro&s;ecution made appear &s;uch pique ever exi&s;ted; has he proved any of his a&s;&s;ertions?

I &s;hall therefore treat his defence with the contempt it de&s;erves, by taking no further notice of it, than to make &s;ome ob&s;ervations on the following part, which contains a very dangerous po&s;ition, under the e&s;tabli&s;hment of which no man's character can remain &s;e|cure.</P>

<P>The captain attempts to compliment him&s;elf at the ex|pence of his judgment and candour, for the principles he lays down here, are as &s;ubver&s;ive of good order and di&s;ci|pline, as his conduct has been found to be un-officer-like &mdash;through the greater part of his defence, the reader will ob&s;erve, that he and his <HI>accomplices</HI> in the compo&s;ition, content them&s;elves with low in&s;inuations and humble &s;cur|rility, but here, with <HI>their aid,</HI> he breaks forth into <HI>heroics,</HI> and bur&s;ting a&s;under all obligations, moral, civil, and mi|litary, advances a new, but to him <HI>favourite po&s;ition</HI>&mdash;that from the principles of liberty, he had a right to think and &s;peak of men and their characters as he plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>This doctrine puts me in mind of the poor ignorant illi|terate &s;oldiers, when fir&s;t enli&s;ted into the American army, who judged, becau&s;e they were engaged in the noble cau&s;e of liberty, they had a right to indulge them&s;elves in every act of licentiou&s;ne&s;s, and therefore, when military di&s;ci|pline had ju&s;tly brought them to the halberds, to &s;uffer for their offences, u&s;ed to cry out&mdash;Is this liberty! is this li|berty!</P>

<P><PB N="87" REF="016334_0086_0F9C26E644226538">It has been a prevailing principle and practice with the captain and his a&s;&s;ociates, to think of men and their cha|racters as they plea&s;ed, and to in&s;inuate their opinions in a particular circle as matters of fact, though with &s;uch re|&s;erve and caution, that the authority could not be come at; but the captain in this in&s;tance having been le&s;s cir|cum&s;pect, was caught wandering out of his tract.</P>
<P>When a commanding officer becomes obnoxious to men of this ca&s;t, by faithfully di&s;charging his duty, and exact|ing that of others for the public good, de&s;pairing of in|juring his reputation by manly and open accu&s;ations, this lurking method is adopted, to remove, or at lea&s;t le&s;&s;en the weight of an object &s;o di&s;gu&s;ting. The captain and his a&s;&s;ociates come truly under this de&s;cription&mdash;their &s;elf-&s;ufficiency naturally renders them impatient of controul, blind to qualifications in others, and re&s;tle&s;s under any command, as they have imbibed &s;o tran&s;cendent an opi|nion of their own importance and capacity&mdash;perhaps it would not be very difficult to point out geniu&s;es of this cla&s;s in our line, who have been re&s;tle&s;s and di&s;&s;ati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fied under the command of almo&s;t every general officer under who&s;e immediate command they have &s;erved&mdash;nor have the excellent orders of the commander in chief in every in&s;tance been implicitly obeyed, or e&s;caped their <HI>nice di&s;|tinctions and critici&s;ms</HI>&mdash;&s;uch re&s;tle&s;s &s;pirits are often real misfortunes even in civil &s;ociety, but become pe&s;ts in an army.</P>
<P>This &s;ecure mode of &s;tabbing my character in the dark, was fir&s;t e&s;&s;ayed, whil&s;t the Maryland troops under my command garri&s;oned Wilmington, where I twice called in a public manner for the authors, and challenged them to point out a &s;ingle in&s;tance, in which I had acted unbecom|ing an officer and a gentleman, as will appear from the following certificates; but not a man has ever &s;tood forth.</P>

<P>In the winter of 1778, whil&s;t the Maryland divi&s;ion lay in Wilmington, a libel was circulated there, tending to revile general Smallwood's character; upon which the ge|neral, calling the officers of the garri&s;on together, at which meeting we were pre&s;ent with many others, when the ge|neral demanding their attention, acquainted them, as far as had come to his knowledge, with the circum&s;tances of the libel, urging, that it was not only fal&s;e and malicious, but one of the ba&s;e&s;t modes of &s;tabbing a character in the dark, adding, that the purport of calling that meeting was, that being very confident the author mu&s;t be pre&s;ent, he &s;aid he took that public method of calling upon him to &s;tand forth, and avow it, and of pronouncing him a cow|ard, a liar, and a &s;coundrel&mdash;notwith&s;tanding which, if

The captain replied he wrote it him&s;elf, the general begged he would excu&s;e him, he did not mean to di&s;tre&s;s him, but was cer|tain he mu&s;t have had a&s;&s;i&s;tance, ob&s;erving that the lan|guage and diction was very different from that u&s;ed in his other writings, and told the captain he &s;hould, as a preli|minary to a reconciliation, require him, on his mo&s;t &s;acred honour, to di&s;cover his accomplices, declaring that he would not &s;uffer him or them, or any &s;et of men whatever, to &s;port with his character or reputation; the captain pau&s;ed&mdash;then &s;aid it was &s;carce worth while&mdash;he could not &s;ay but there were &s;ome words not his own, the general &s;aid that was one point he &s;hould, in&s;i&s;t on, and that the captain &s;hould renounce and retract his a&s;&s;ertions, and the exceptionable parts of his defence; the captain &s;aid he was now &s;en&s;ible he had been mi&s;informed, and led into a deception, and he was willing to retract his a&s;&s;ertions, the general &s;aid he would &s;end him the terms in writing on which he would con&s;ent to a reconciliation, and when the captain complied with them, he would u&s;e his influence to have him re&s;tored to his command; the general then took leave of the captain and returned to the troops.</P>

<P><PB N="105" REF="016334_0104_0F9C26F3C3460B10">Having now traced him through all his <HI>windings and doublings,</HI> and left him in a labyrinth, I &s;ubmit to the im|partial public to decide on his conduct, and my reputation, which I tru&s;t has ever been unblemi&s;hed, and it ever has, and I hope ever will be my fir&s;t wi&s;h, to conduct my&s;elf in &s;uch a manner, as to merit their approbation, therefore I have no apprehen&s;ion that their good opinion and confi|dence will be le&s;&s;ened by any &s;ecret machinations of the captain, or his a&s;&s;ociates; and as he may &s;till be under the influence of his evil genius, I &s;hall here leave him, wi&s;hing he may be enlightened with <HI>ju&s;t &s;entiments of honour,</HI> and re&s;tored again to his <HI>proper &s;en&s;es,</HI> which he has affect|ed to have lo&s;t.</P>
