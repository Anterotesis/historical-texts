<P>CHRIST JESUS in the 18th Ver&s;e acquaints the Di&s;ciples with His own Authority: <HI>All Power is given unto Me in Heaven and in Earth.</HI> And then He Exerci&s;es His Authority in Commi&s;&s;ionating them. And fir&s;t, He tells them to whom they &s;hall go. <HI>viz. To all Nations,</HI> as they had Opportunity. They were forbiden formerly to go to the Gentiles. Mat. 10.5. <HI>Go not into the way of the Gentiles, &amp; in|to any City of the Samaritans enter ye not;</HI> but now He takes off that prohibition, tho' they were fir&s;t
<PB N="2" REF="001999_0003_0FBA56D1F90C6690">to offer the Go&s;pel to the Jews. <HI>Paul &amp; Barna|bas</HI> told the Jews, <HI>That it was nece&s;&s;ary that the Go&s;pel &s;hould fir&s;t be &s;poken to them,</HI> Act. 13.46. Secondly, Here be the &s;everal Offices which they are to Attend. (1) They were to make Di&s;ciples. We render it, Teach the word is <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>Di&s;ciple all Nations.</HI> They were to bring them to the acknowledgment of Chri&s;t &amp; the Profe&s;&s;ion of the Go&s;pel. (2) They were to Baptize them in the Name of the Father and of the Son &amp; of the Holy Gho&s;t. This is a Seal of the Covenant that &s;ucceeds in the room of Cir|cumci&s;ion, Repre&s;enting our being wa&s;ned from our Sins in the blood of Chri&s;t: This mu&s;t be applied to all Di&s;ciples Adult and Infants. (3) They mu&s;t teach them all rules of Obedience. This comprehends the whole Law of God both Moral &amp; In&s;tituted, what ever was their duty to practice, that was the duty of the Di&s;ciples to Preach. This work that He &s;ets them about was attended with much difficulty, con&s;idering the corruption of Nature, and the prejudices that both <HI>Jews &amp; Gentiles</HI> were under; therefore He incourages them that He will be with them. He would have them take &s;pecial notice of it, <HI>Lo, I am with you.</HI> Mind here, 1&s;t. What He pro|mi&s;es, that is, His Pre&s;ence. He was about to remove to Heaven, but he tells them, He will
<PB N="3" REF="001999_0004_0FBA56D7099961D8">be with them; though He was ab&s;ent as to His Humane Nature, yet He would be with them, by His Spirit and His Power. 2ly. The Per|&s;ons to whom the promi&s;e is made, and they are immediately the Eleven Apo&s;tles: But He in|tends their Succe&s;&s;ors al&s;o.

<Q><HI>CHRIST JESUS will be pre&s;ent with the Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel to the End of the World.</HI></Q>
<P>CHRIST was eminently with the Apo&s;tles, &s;o that in a &s;hort time, they &s;et up Churches in many parts of the World, and laid a foun|dation of the profe&s;&s;ion of the Chri&s;tian Reli|gion, both among civil and barbarous Nations; and tho' Mini&s;ters in the&s;e days mu&s;t not ex|pect &s;uch extraordinary gifts, or &s;uch wonder|ful &s;ucce&s;s as they had; yet they have the word of Chri&s;t for it, that He will be with them. They may conclude that Satan will be bu&s;y to oppo&s;e them: But this is their incouragement that Chri&s;t will be pre&s;ent with them. The work of the Mini&s;try is difficult work. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;aith, <HI>Who is &s;ufficient for the&s;e things,</HI> 2 Cor.
<PB N="4" REF="001999_0005_0FBA56D81AE9C158">2.16. But yet there is no rea&s;on that they &s;hould faint under their burden, for Chri&s;t &s;aith He will be with them. The Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel are Chri&s;ts Mini&s;ters, and their Service is Service for Chri&s;t, therefore it is no wonder that He will be pre&s;ent with them. When God &s;ent <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> to the Children of I&s;rael, He tells them that <HI>He will be with him,</HI> Exod. 3.12. So when Chri&s;t &s;ends his Mini&s;ters, He tells them that He will be with them; and it is a great Comfort to the People, that Chri&s;t will be with their Mini&s;ters: and this is not the Privilege of One Generation, or a few Genera|tions, but of all Generations to the end of the World.</P>
<P>Here it may be inquired, [1.] <HI>How do Mi|ni&s;ters need the Pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t?</HI> [2] <HI>How will Chri&s;t be pre&s;ent with them?</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Que&s;t. <HI>How do Mini&s;ters need the Pre&s;ence of Christ?</HI></P>
<P>An&s;w. 1. <HI>To furni&s;h them with Gifts for their Work.</HI> There was need of extraordinary Gifts in the beginning of the Go&s;pel, for the removal of Prejudices: both <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles</HI> by rea&s;on of their Education were under Prejudices, and there was need of Miraculous Gifts to prepare them to con&s;ider impartially the Doctrine
<PB N="5" REF="001999_0006_0FBA56D98DE51930">taught by the Apo&s;tles. And Mini&s;ters now need Chri&s;ts pre&s;ence to furni&s;h them with Gifts: there is need of a great deal of Wi&s;dom <HI>to find out acceptable words</HI> Eccl. 12.10. <HI>The Preacher &s;ought to find acceptable words.</HI> They need a great deal of Knowledge to accompli&s;h them for their work: The Mini&s;ter needs great Knowledge in the Scripture to inable him to an&s;wer all Ca&s;es of Con&s;cience that may be put to him; to help Per&s;ons that are in the dark to judge aright of their Condition, to inable them to &s;ee their Sincerity or their Hypocri&s;y; they need a great deal of Light from Chri&s;t, that they may under&s;tand the Truth in things that are controverted, and lead the People in the right way: there be abundance of Mi&s;takes among Men in Matters of Religion, &s;ome of them very dangerous, all of ill con&s;equence; and Mini&s;ters need Light from God, that they may not be blind guides: they need Divine Teaching, that they may be able <HI>to convince</HI> Men that do oppo&s;e the Truth; and to e&s;tabli&s;h them that do receive it He mu&s;t be able to <HI>con|vince gain&s;ayers,</HI> Tit. 1.9. There is a great deal of darkne&s;s among Men about Matters of Faith, about Moral Rules, and about Divine In&s;titu|tions; and Mini&s;ters need to be taught of God that they may teach People the good and the
<PB N="6" REF="001999_0007_0FBA56DB218807B8">right way. It is not enough for a Mini&s;ter to be able to make &s;ome Edifying Di&s;cour&s;es; he &s;hould be able to &s;et tho&s;e points that are more intricate in a true light, and to &s;peak accurate|ly, to all tho&s;e Ca&s;es that the Souls of Men need help in.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>To &s;trengthen them again&s;t Temptation.</HI> The Calling of a Mini&s;ter lays him open to great Temptation, e&s;pecially thro' a Spirit of Fear to neglect his duty; &s;ometimes he is cal|led to Preach &s;uch Truths as will be offen&s;ive to &s;ome, and &s;tir up their di&s;plea&s;ure and op|po&s;ition; &s;ometimes to give &s;uch Reproofs as will be taken very hardly by &s;ome Men, they will &s;tomach it that they are reflected upon; &s;ometimes he is under a nece&s;&s;ity to deal with &s;ome Men, that don't know how to bear it. And there is danger of being out-bid with a Spirit of Fear; &s;ome are his Friends and he is loth to offend them, he has a dependance up|on &s;ome, and it is dangerous cro&s;&s;ing them: in &s;uch ca&s;es he needs a great deal of help from Chri&s;t to &s;trengthen his Love and his Faith, that he may be bold to do his duty. When <HI>Jonah</HI> was &s;ent to cry again&s;t <HI>Nineveh</HI> becau&s;e of their wickedne&s;s, his fear ma&s;tered him, &s;o that he fled to <HI>Tar&s;hi&s;h,</HI> Jon. 1.2, 3. He was terrifyed to think what u&s;age he &s;hould
<PB N="7" REF="001999_0008_0FBA56DD72FF38B8">meet with all, and to avoid the anger of Men expo&s;ed him&s;elf to the anger of God. Faith|fulne&s;s may expo&s;e them to great Sorrows, the fear of which &s;ometimes makes to be unfaith|ful. <HI>Paul</HI> begs prayers on that account Eph. 6.19, 20. <HI>And for me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the My&s;tery of the Go&s;pel, for which I am an Amba&s;&s;ador in bonds, that there|in I may &s;peak boldly, as I ought to &s;peak.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>To protect their Per&s;ons.</HI> In times of Per|&s;ecution Mini&s;ters are more expo&s;ed than other Men; they are looked on as the head of their Party, and the principal &s;pight is again&s;t them. <HI>Jezabel</HI> cut off the Prophets of the Lord &s;o the Papi&s;ts have a particular Malice again&s;t them: and about Fifty Years &s;ince, Two Thou&s;and Mini&s;ters were &s;ilenced in <HI>England,</HI> in one day, and many of them expo&s;ed to great &s;traits: and at other times, they are expo&s;ed to many wrongs and injuries, and need help from God for their deliverance. <HI>Paul</HI> was delivered through the Pre&s;ence of God. 2 Tim. 4 17. <HI>The Lord &s;tood with me, and &s;trengthned me, and I was deliverea out of the Mouth of the Lion.</HI> Chri&s;t promi&s;ed <HI>Paul</HI> to deliver him, Acts 26.17. <HI>Delivering thee from the People and from the Gentiles to whom I &s;end thee</HI> And &s;o He did many times. If God had not delivered him, he had not continued in
<PB N="8" REF="001999_0009_0FBA56E2CA34E270">his work as he did, but would have fallen a Sacrifice to the rage of his Enemies many Years before he did. Acts 26.22. <HI>Having obtained help of God I continue unto this day.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>To Succeed their Labours.</HI> They need to be pro&s;pered in their labours, that there may be a Reformation wrought in the Land; that tho&s;e corrupt Practices which bring down the Judg|ment of God may be put away: And in order to this, they need the help of God. It is God's work to prepare Men to Reform. 2 Chron 29.36. <HI>And Hezekiah rejoyced &amp; all the People, that God had prepared the People, for the thing was done &s;uddenly.</HI> There is need of Divine help that the labours of Mini&s;ters may be pro&s;perous for the Comforting of Di&s;con&s;olate Saints: Some|times they are like <HI>Rachel, Refu&s;ing to be com|forted.</HI> There is need of the Pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t with Mini&s;ters for the Awakning of Sinners and bringing them to Chri&s;t. Mini&s;ters will Preach to no purpo&s;e if God do not &s;end His Spirit. Mini&s;ters can't open blind Eyes, nor rai&s;e dead Men to Life. Job. 16.7, 8. <HI>If I depart I will &s;end the Comforter unto you, and when he is come, be will reprove the world of Sin, of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and of Judgment.</HI> It is God that adds Efficacy to the Ordinances. 2 Cor. 10.4. <HI>The weapons of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> are mighty through God to the pulling
<PB N="9" REF="001999_0010_0FBA56E6EFE4C5D0">down of strong holds.</HI> It is God that ca&s;ts out Devils. It is Chri&s;ts work to build up His Church. It is a Divine work to make the Ar|rows of the word &s;tick in the Hearts of Men. Mini&s;ters may wa&s;te their Spirits, tire their Brains, and weary their Bodies to no purpo&s;e, if God don't add the operation of His Spirit. If God do not give His Ble&s;&s;ing to their labours, they may take up that complaint, I&s;a. 49.4. <HI>I have laboured in vain, and &s;pent my &s;trength for naught and in vain.</HI> Men can remain &s;otti&s;h and un|believing under the be&s;t means. <HI>It is God that takes away the heart of &s;tone and gives an heart of fle&s;h,</HI> Ezek. 11.19. Mini&s;ters may take pains and write their Sermons, but it is God only <HI>that writes the Law in the hearts of men.</HI> Jer. 31.33. It is <HI>His Voice that rai&s;eth dead &s;ouls,</HI> Joh. 5.25. The Word of God is the Sword of the Spirit.</P>
<P N="2">2. Que&s;t. <HI>How will Chri&s;t be pre&s;ent with them?</HI> How doth He ingage His Pre&s;ence? How far may we depend on tho&s;e words of Chri&s;t, without &s;training them? If we con&s;ider the Qualities of many Mini&s;ters, we cannot conceive any eminent Pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t with them; many of the Prie&s;ts of Old were very bad. Jer. 2.8. <HI>The Prie&s;ts &s;aid not, Where is the Lord, and they that handle the Law know me not:
<PB N="10" REF="001999_0011_0FBA56E7CA898A50">and the Pa&s;tors have tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed again&s;t me.</HI> So the <HI>Scribes &amp; Phari&s;ees</HI> were very corrupt. Mat. 23.3. <HI>Do not after their works, for they &s;ay and do nor.</HI> And &s;o it is at this day in many Countries, e&s;pecially with &s;ome Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel; their Practices are &s;uch as make many to &s;tum|ble at the Law.</P>
<P>An&s;w. 1. <HI>CHRIST will be &s;o pre&s;ent with the Go&s;pel-Mini&s;try, that His vi&s;ible Kingdom &s;hall be upheld.</HI> If &s;ome of them be notoriou&s;ly defective of their duty; yet by tho&s;e that are in the Mi|ni&s;try, His work &s;hall be carryed on, and His Kingdom &s;hall be pre&s;erved throughout all Ge|nerations. The Go&s;pel &s;hall be Preached and there &s;hall be tho&s;e that &s;hall make a Profe&s;&s;ion of the Truth. The Kingdom of Chri&s;t is &s;ome|times in a more fiouri&s;hing condition, and &s;ome|times it withers: but it &s;hall never be <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> of the&s;e Kings, &s;hall the God of Heaven set up a Kingdom, that &s;hall never be de&s;troyed. Mar. 16.18. <HI>Upon this Rock will I build my Church, and the gates of hell &s;hall not prevail again&s;t it.</HI> God has made a donation of an Eternal Kingdom to Chri&s;t. P&s;al. 72.17. <HI>His Name &s;hall endure for ever, it &s;hall continue as long as the Sun.</HI> How many &s;ecure, carnal and corrupt men are in the Mini&s;try, that con|tribute very little to the upholding of His King|dom?
<PB N="11" REF="001999_0012_0FBA56E951629B78">yet there &s;hall be &s;uch a Pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t with &s;ome that are in the Mini&s;try, that neither Per&s;ecutuion nor Here&s;y &s;hall prevail to root out the Kingdom of Chri&s;t. God will &s;o far pro&s;per the labours of the Mini&s;try, that the Church &s;hall be Immortal: There &s;hall be a Succe&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e that &s;hall make a Profe&s;&s;ion of the Go&s;pel: There &s;hall always be Witne&s;&s;es for Chri&s;t, tho' for a long while they Prophecy in Sackcloth. Chri&s;t &s;hall divide the &s;poil with the Mighty.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>CHRIST will be &s;o pre&s;ent with them, that all the Elect &s;hall be brought in.</HI> There be a Number who&s;e Names are written in the Lambs book of Life: there be a Number that God hath given to Chri&s;t, and God will ble&s;s the labours of Mini&s;ters unto their Conver&s;ion, &amp; their Per|&s;everance in Holine&s;s. Some Preach Chri&s;t out of love, and &s;ome for carnal ends. So it was of Old. Phil. 1 15. <HI>Some indeed Preach Chri&s;t even of envy and &s;trife, and &s;ome of good will</HI> But Chri&s;t doth &s;o far ble&s;s the Preaching and Writing of the Mini&s;try, that all the Elect &s;hall be brought in. In &s;ome Ages many are Con|verted, and in all Ages &s;uch as do belong unto the Election of Grace Joh 6.37. <HI>All that the Father hath given me &s;hall come unto me.</HI> Rom. 11.7. <HI>The Election hath obtained.</HI> Rom. 8.30. <HI>Whom
<PB N="12" REF="001999_0013_0FBA56EB4B61F890">he did Prede&s;linate, them he al&s;o Called, and whom be Called, them be al&s;o Ju&s;tifyed.</HI> Whether the Means be greater or le&s;s, there &s;hall be &s;uch a Pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t with them, that all whom God has cho&s;en &s;hall be Converted. If any of them live under corrupt and vicious Mini&s;ters, yet they &s;hall not mi&s;carry; the light that they enjoy &s;hall prevail for their Conver&s;ion and Sal|vation. P&s;al. 132.16. <HI>I will cloath her Prie&s;ts with Salvation.</HI> Chri&s;t will not loo&s;e any of tho&s;e that the Father hath given him.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>CHRIST will be pre&s;ent with many of them and make them gracious.</HI> For the advantage of Religion God will prepare many Godly Men to Preach the Go&s;pel: The Piety of Mini&s;ters is greatly for the promoting of Religion: Piety makes them more findious: Piety furni&s;hes them with &s;uch Experience, as greatly helps them in their work: Piety makes them more faithful to the Souls of Men; and the &s;en&s;e that People have of their Piety, cau&s;eth them to lay the more weight on their words, and cau&s;es the word to fall with more authority on them. God fits Men for the Mini&s;try. So God fitted <HI>Paul:</HI> He had cho&s;en him to Preach the Go&s;pel, and Conver|ted him in a wonderful manner. Gal. 1.15, 16. <HI>It plea&s;ed God who &s;eparated me from my Mothers Womb, and called me by his Grace, to reveal his Son
<PB N="13" REF="001999_0014_0FBA56EC4ADCFD98">in me.</HI> God promi&s;ed of old <HI>to rai&s;e up a faith|ful Priest,</HI> 1 Sam. 2.35. And &s;ometimes e&s;pe|cially there &s;hall be a great Number of faithful Preachers. Jer. 3.15. <HI>I will give them Pa&s;tors af|ter mine own heart, that &s;hall feed them with Know|ledge and Under&s;tanding.</HI> Chri&s;t advi&s;eth us to Pray that it may be &s;o. Mat. 9.38. <HI>Pray ye the Lord of the harve&s;t, that he would &s;end forth la|bourers into his harve&s;t.</HI> And He doth at times eminently an&s;wer &s;uch Prayers. So He did at the time of the ca&s;ting off of Popery, which that Scripture hath reference unto, Rev. 14.6. <HI>I &s;aw another Angel flie in the midst of Heaven, having the Everla&s;ting Go&s;pel to preach to them that dwell on the Earth.</HI> God rai&s;ed up <HI>Luther</HI> and <HI>Melancthon,</HI> and <HI>Zwinglius,</HI> and <HI>Calvin,</HI> with many others, who did great Service to the Church of God. God Converts &s;ome Men and then makes them Mini&s;ters. So he did <HI>Paul:</HI> He made him faithful, and &s;o put him into the Mini&s;try, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.12. And He puts &s;ome Men into the Mini&s;try and then Converts them. They are qualifyed with Gifts and Learning be|fore, and after they are entred into the work, God qualifies them with Grace. Acts 6.7. <HI>A great company of the Priests were obedient unto the Faith.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>CRHIST will be graciou&s;ly pre&s;ent with
<PB N="14" REF="001999_0015_0FBA56EE01676000">them that are faithful.</HI> It is a great commenda|tion of a Mini&s;ter to be a faithful Man. Col. 1.7. <HI>Epaphras, is for you a faithful Mini&s;ter of Christ.</HI> Such Men &s;hall have the gracious Pre|&s;ence of God. He will own them in their work, tho' it may be in different degrees. God don't give the &s;ame light to one faithful Man that He doth to another. Some godly Men are left to great Mi&s;takes. Godline&s;s is no &s;ecurity again&s;t le&s;&s;er Errors. Neither doth He give the like mea&s;ure of protection to one as to another. He appears more eminently for the pre&s;ervation of one, and the vindication of one, than of another. He eminently vindicated <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> as a reward of his faithfulne&s;s. Numb. 12.7. <HI>My &s;ervant Mo&s;es is not &s;o, who is faithful in all my hou&s;e.</HI> So He doth more eminently &s;ucceed the labours of one than of another. Some have more abundant &s;ucce&s;s, while &s;ome Men take abundance of pains, and there appears little profit: Others have great occa&s;ion to rejoyce that they have not run in vain. <HI>Paul</HI> had great &s;ucce&s;s. Rom. 15.29. <HI>I am &s;ure, that when I come unto you, I &s;hall come in the fulne&s;s of the ble&s;&s;ing of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>USE, I. <HI>This is ground of Encouragement to People, in Praying for the Pre&s;ence of God with their Mini&s;ters.</HI> The Mini&s;ter &s;hould Pray for
<PB N="15" REF="001999_0016_0FBA56F4037139C0">the People, and the People &s;hould Pray for their Mini&s;ters, for their own Mini&s;ters, and for the Mini&s;ters of the Land; yea, and for the Mi|ni&s;ters of the Chri&s;tian World. <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> Prays for the Mini&s;ters. Deut. 33.8. <HI>And of Levi he &s;aid, Let thy Thummim, and thy Urim be with the holy One,</HI> &amp;c. Ver&s;e 11. <HI>Ble&s;s, Lord his &s;ub&s;tance, and accept the work of his hands. David</HI> did &s;o, P&s;al. 132.9. <HI>Let thy Priests be clothed with Righteou&s;|ne&s;s.</HI> There is ground of incouragement that Chri&s;t hath promi&s;ed His Pre&s;ence with them. This Promi&s;e may make you bold and free in Praying for them: you may conclude that 'tis acceptable to God &s;o to do. You may gather from this Promi&s;e that you are welcome to Pray for them, that it is a thing &s;uitable to the Heart of God, and that there is great hopes that God will accept of &s;uch Prayers. Indeed God don't oblige Him&s;elf as to the degree of this Mercy, but you have no rea&s;on to be di&s;|couraged, He allows you to put Him in mind of His Promi&s;e, and to beg of Him that He would remember His Word, and fulfill it graciou&s;ly. You &s;hould look on this Mercy as a Mercy that God delights to be&s;tow, and &s;o come boldly to the Throne of Grace for it.</P>
<P>There be three faults contrary to this.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>When People Pray for them for Forms &s;ake.</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="001999_0017_0FBA56F7F16B8510">Many People have got a cu&s;tom when they make their Prayers, to &s;ay &s;omething in a cur&s;ory way for their Mini&s;ters: but it is not upon their heart that God would be with them. We have many People that are violently carrying on worldly de&s;igns, that are panting after the du&s;t of the Earth, that make light of the Go&s;pel, and go one to his Farm and another to his Mer|chandize: the&s;e Men are but formal in their Prayers for Spiritual Ble&s;&s;ings; they &s;pend it may be the greate&s;t part of their time in Prayer about Spiritual Ble&s;&s;ings, but their hearts don't go with their words. So they Pray for their Mini&s;ters, but it is only of cour&s;e, becau&s;e it is their manner: their hearts are not much in it that the labours of their Mini&s;ters be ble&s;&s;ed, either to others or to them&s;elves; when the words are out of their Mouths they have done with it, they think no more on it; they don't look after their Prayers to &s;ee what an&s;wer God gives them; if they be not heard they don't trouble them&s;elves, their hearts are not on the pro&s;perity of Religion; there is much of <HI>Gallio</HI>'s Spirit in them: <HI>They care not for tho&s;e matters,</HI> Acts 18. 17.</P>

<P N="3">3. <HI>When Men Pray pre&s;umptuou&s;ly for them.</HI> Some err on this hand, either from a mi&s;under|&s;tanding of the Promi&s;es, as if God were &s;o bound to ble&s;s the labours of His Mini&s;ters, that He

Some pre&s;ume upon their Prayers, as if they did Merit to be heard; as if their earne&s;t Prayers mu&s;t needs engage God, and it would not be fair for God to de|ny them; whereas if their Prayers be an&s;wered it is from free Grace.</P>

Not to be incouraged is to neglect the proper u&s;e of the&s;e words: The&s;e words, <HI>I will be with you,</HI> are a good foundation for them to Pray in Faith for it.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Chri&s;t is under bonds to grant His Pre&s;ence to the Ministry.</HI> This Promi&s;e is ab&s;olute to the Mini&s;try.

Eph. 4.11, 12. <HI>He gave &s;ome Apo&s;tles, &s;ome Prophets, &s;ome Evangeli&s;ts, &s;ome Pa&s;tors and Teachers, for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Mi|ni&s;try, for the edifying of the body of Christ.</HI> And He has Elect Ones to be brought in in all Ages: There &s;hall be a Succe&s;&s;ion of godly Ones to the End of the World.

USE, III. <HI>Ministers &s;hould do what they can that they may have the Pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t with them.</HI> It is true, that Chri&s;t acts &s;omewhat arbitrarily in this matter: yet there are rules to be attended that you may engage the Pre|&s;ence of Chri&s;t with you; and it is well worth the while to take care in this matter. It is a great comfort &amp; incouragement to a Mini&s;ter to &s;ee the Pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t with his labours. It is a &s;mile upon him; though it be no certain &s;ign of Sincerity, yet therein God &s;miles on him: It is an honour to him. When God &s;ets his Seal to his Mini&s;try, God owns him in his work. 1 Cor. 9.2. <HI>The Seal of my Apo&s;tle&s;hip are ye in the Lord.</HI> When God is pre&s;ent with his labours He makes him a ble&s;&s;ing; which was part of the happine&s;s of <HI>Abraham:</HI> God tells him, <HI>I will ble&s;s thee and thou &s;halt be a ble&s;&s;ing.</HI> Gen. 12.2. Dr <HI>Williams,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> in his old Age expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in this manner, <Q>That he had born many honourable Offices, but if he did know that he had been an in|&s;trument to Convert one Soul to God, it would be more comfort to him, than all the Offices that he had &s;u&s;tained.</Q> To be u&s;ele&s;s is a reproach, to be an in&s;trument to do hurt is a cur&s;e, but to be an in&s;trument of good is a great

<P N="1">1. <HI>Be of an unblameable Conver&s;ation.</HI> The holy carriages of Mini&s;ters have a natural tendency to beget aregard in the hearts of hearers; holy carriages do command re&s;pect, and prepare Men to receive advice. They are more ready to believe Men of good than men of bad Con|ver&s;ation. Holy carriages in Preachers take off prejudices from the Spirits of hearers: It &s;eems to Men that &s;uch Mini&s;ters urge rules from Con&s;cience and Compa&s;&s;ion. But an unholy Conver&s;ation dimini&s;hes Mens authority, their Words don't &s;ink into the hearts of their hearers, they don't look upon their advice as flowing from a gracious Spirit, but from &s;ome lower principles. But Men of a holy Conver&s;ation have a room in the hearts of others. Be&s;ides, this is a way to engage the Pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t. Evil carriages are abominable to Chri&s;t, but holy carriages are acceptable to Chri&s;t. Men that walk holily put honour upon him; and <HI>He will honour them that honour him,</HI> 1 Sam. 2.30. When Men carry holily, God delights to &s;ucceed their labours. Mal. 2.6. <HI>He walked with me in Peace and Equity, and did turn many away from iniquity.</HI> But when Men carry corruptly, He many times ca&s;ts contempt on them, and their
<PB N="26" REF="001999_0027_0FBA571C67099378">Mini&s;try is not ble&s;&s;ed. Mal. 2.8, 9. <HI>But ye are departed out of the way; ye have cau&s;ed many to &s;tumble at the Law; ye have corrupted the Co|venant of Levi, faith the Lord of ho&s;ts: Therefore have. I al&s;o made you contemptible and ba&s;e before all the People; according as ye have not kept my ways, but have been partial in the Law.</HI> An unholy Conver&s;ation brings a bla&s;t upon their labours. The pro&s;perity of Religion don't de|pend on the labours of Men that do not honour it: their words will not prevail without their practice: they mu&s;t Preach in their Conver&s;a|tion on Week days, as well as in the Pulpit on the Sabbath.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>In&s;i&s;t on tho&s;e things that Men &s;tand in &s;pecial need of.</HI> All Scripture is profitable, but the great de&s;ign of the Scripture and the Mini&s;try is to Convert Men to God. Acts 26.18. <HI>To open their blind eyes, to turn them from darkne&s;s to light, and from the power of Satan unto God.</HI> Some Mini|&s;ters &s;peak a great deal to Saints to comfort and incourage them; and alas, there be but a few of them in many Congregations: The body of the People are in a peri&s;hing condition; and there is ten times more need that Men be a|wakened and terrifyed.

It is not a little hint now and then, that will make them work out their Salvation with fear and trembling. Many Men are in a fa&s;t Sleep, and whi&s;pering will not awaken them; the threatnings of God had need ring in their Ears; they are &s;o athei&s;tical and devoted to the World, that it is well if Thunder &amp; Light|ning will &s;care them; they are &s;o hardned, that talking moderately to them, as <HI>Eli</HI> did to his Sons, takes no more impre&s;&s;ion on them, than on the Seats of the Meeting hou&s;e.

When we Pray for His Pre&s;ence, we acknowledge that we are unworthy of it; that we cannot challenge it as due, but depend on His Grace, to make it good to us; that we mu&s;t have it in a way of free gift. When we Pray for it, we acknowledge His &s;ufficiency to help us; that if we have His Pre&s;ence, that will be enough, that then we may go chearfully on in our work.

<HEAD>An Examination of the Power of the FRATERNITY.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By the &s;ame Author.</BYLINE>
<P>THE mi&s;takes of one Generation many times become the calamity of &s;ucceeding Generations. The pre&s;ent Generation are not only unhappy by rea&s;on of the dark|ne&s;s of their own Minds, but the errors of tho&s;e who have gone before them, have been a foundation of a great deal of Mi&s;ery. Po&s;terity is very prone to e&s;pou&s;e the principles of Ance&s;tors, and from an in|ordinate Veneration of them, to apprehend a &s;acred|ne&s;s in their Opinions, and don't give them&s;elves the trouble to make an impartial Examination of them, as if it were a tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion to call them into que&s;tion, and bordered upon Irreligion to be wave|ring about them; and the carnal intere&s;ts of many Per&s;ons has no &s;mall influence upon them, to pre|vail with them to engage violently in the Vindi|cation of them.</P>
<P>And if any particular Per&s;ons have been led by God into the under&s;tanding of tho&s;e mi&s;takes, and have made their differing Sentiments Publick, it has proved an occa&s;ion of much Sorrow; and many People have fallen into Parties, whereby a Spirit of
<PB N="2" REF="001999_0032_0FBA572C2227D1F8">Lore has been quenched, and great heats have ri&s;en, from whence have proceeded, Cen&s;ures and Re|proaches, and &s;ometimes Separation &amp; Per&s;ecution. There have been two eminent in&s;tances of this in latter times. When the People of <HI>England</HI> ca&s;t off the Doctriues of Popery, they retained many of the Ceremonies of the Church of <HI>Rome;</HI> as the <HI>Surplice, Cro&s;, in Bapti&s;m,</HI> and <HI>Kneeling at the Lords Supper,</HI> &amp;c. and this has been a wounding thing to their Po&s;te|rity. The Generations &s;ince have been greatly di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed by their Contentions about tho&s;e things. Many Books have been written for and again&s;t the Cere|monies; and &s;ometimes one party has got the upper hand, and have per&s;ecuted the other with a great deal of har&s;hne&s;s and &s;everity, to the undoing of many Families: Sometimes the other party has prevailed, and knew not how to u&s;e their advantage with moderation, and there is no pro&s;pect of the end of the&s;e troubles; the di&s;cords run &s;ometimes high|er and &s;ometimes lower, but nothing appears in Pro|vidence, but that they may be perpetual.</P>
<P>The other in&s;tance is in <HI>New-England;</HI> The fir&s;t Planters drew up a Platform of Church Di&s;cipline, before they had much time to weigh tho&s;e things, and when they were under prejudices, from the ex|perience of their &s;ufferings in <HI>England;</HI> and &s;ome of their Po&s;terity are mightily devoted to it, as if the Platform were the Pattern in the Mount, and all deviations from it, are looked upon as a degree of Apo&s;tacy; others have taken the liberty to Exa|mine it, and can di&s;cover no foundation in the Word of God for many Po&s;itions therein: the&s;e differences do much interrupt our quiet and hinder
<PB N="3" REF="001999_0033_0FBA572EC958E220">the flouri&s;hing of Religion. Some Per&s;ons place a great part of their Religion in their being of this or that party; and others who have better Principles, &s;pend more of their zeal in the&s;e Controver&s;ies thau is meet, and thereby it comes to pa&s;s that weightier matters are too much neglected. Mens Corruptions are drawn forth, offences are given, and &s;ome times offence is taken, to the great di&s;advantage of the Intere&s;t of Religion. There is a nece&s;&s;ity of the vindicating the Truth, yet we cannot do it without making &s;ome di&s;turbance</P>
<P>In the Platform it is &s;uffirmed, <HI>That the Brothren have power of judgment in matters of Cen&s;ure, and power in admitting of Members.</HI></P>
<P>This Principle is very Popular; it is taking with them to &s;ee them&s;elves advanced to a &s;hare in the government: They have a greater fondne&s;s for power than ability to u&s;e it, and nothing but light as clear as the light of the Sun at Noon day, will prevail with &s;ome Men to part with one Inch of that power, which they are told, doth belong to them.</P>
<P>But I &s;hall endeavour to clear it up, <HI>That the go|vernment of the Church is given unto the Elders, &amp; that the Fraternity have no power in binding &amp; loo&s;ing.</HI></P>
<P>CHRIST JESUS is the ab&s;olute head of the Church, and keeps that part of government en|tirely in His own hands, to appoint Officers and Laws for His Church. The Civil Magi&s;trate has power al&s;o in many Eccle&s;ia&s;tical ca&s;es; he may appoint days of Fa&s;ting, as <HI>Jeho&s;haphat</HI> did, 2 Chren. 20.3. <HI>Jeho&s;haphat feared &amp; &s;et him&s;elf to &s;eek the Lord and proclaimed a Fa&s;t throughout all Judah.</HI> And by the &s;ame rea&s;on they may appoint days of Thank|giving,
<PB N="4" REF="001999_0034_0FBA57318E2598E8">they may call Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Councils, they may take care of the Maintenance of Mini&s;ters, they may Suppre&s;s tho&s;e that give di&s;turbance to the Church.</P>
<P>The Elders with the Church have power al&s;o occa|&s;ionally to appoint days of Fa&s;ting or Thanksgiving.</P>
<P>The Brethren of the Church have power to choo&s;e their own Officers. It &s;eems al&s;o to belong to the body of the People to appoint where their Meeting|hou&s;e &s;hall be &s;et. But Spiritual power of govern|ing the Church, by admitting of Members, Cen&s;u|ing of Offenders, and taking off of Cen&s;ures, doth belong entirely to the Elders.</P>
<P N="1">1. Arg. Is from Mat. 16.19. <HI>I will give unto thee the Keys of the King done of Heaven, and what&s;oever thou &s;halt bind on earth &s;hall be bound in heaven; and what|&s;oever thou &s;halt loo&s;e on earth &s;hall be loo&s;ed in heaven.</HI> And Joh. 20 23. Chri&s;t &s;aith to the Apo&s;tles <HI>Who&s;e &s;ins ye remit, they are remitted to them, and who&s;oever &s;ins ye retain, they are retained.</HI> Here you may con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="1">1. What is given: There be two expre&s;&s;ions of this, The fir&s;t is <HI>the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven:</HI> This intends power over the Church. The Keys are the En&s;ign of Authority When <HI>Eliakim</HI> was made Steward of the Kings hou&s;e, it is expre&s;&s;ed in this manner: I&s;ai. 22 22. <HI>The Key of the hou&s;e of David I will lay upon his &s;houlder, &s;o he &s;hall open and none &s;hall &s;hut, and he &s;hall &s;hut and none &s;hall open.</HI> At this day, when a be&s;ieged City doth render to the be&s;iegers, they deliver up the Keys as a &s;ign of their Subjection. The &s;econd expre&s;&s;ion is, <HI>That what he binds on earth is bound in heaven,</HI> &amp;c. This notes a power to inflict Church Cen&s;ures, and al&s;o to deliver from them: for in <HI>John</HI> it is explained by <HI>permitting &amp; retaining &s;ins.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="5" REF="001999_0035_0FBA573424CB7AB8">
2. The Subject that this power is given unto, <HI>viz.</HI> Fir&s;tly to <HI>Peter</HI> and to the re&s;t of the Apo&s;tles, and &s;o to their Succe&s;&s;ors to the end of the World. As the Church is to continue, &s;o the government of the Church mu&s;t be continued. Go&s;pel Ordinances will continue in force to the end of the World; therefore the Go&s;pel Church is called, <HI>A Kingdom that cannot be moved,</HI> Heb. 12.28. The Key of Doctrine doth belong to the Mini&s;ters, they are the Succe&s;&s;ors of the Apo&s;tles to the end of the World: And the Key of Di&s;cipline belongs to the &s;ame Per&s;ons that the Key of Doctrine doth belong to. Heb. 13.7. <HI>Remember them that have the rule over you, that have &s;poken to you the Word of God.</HI> The managing of the Keys is a work of Office, and therefore doth belong to tho&s;e that have Office power in the Church.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not &s;hew how this Scripture has been abu|&s;ed by tho&s;e of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> for the E&s;ta|bli&s;hing of Papal power; But mind you how it hath been darkned by a violent interpretation among out &s;elves, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Keys were given to <HI>Peter</HI> partly as an Apo&s;tle, partly as a Mini&s;ter, partly as a Belie|ver. This interpretation has more of fancy than truth: If this interpretation were given by in&s;pired Men, it ought to be received, but there is not a tittle in the Text that looks that way.</P>
<P>If Chri&s;t had &s;aid, That He gave unto the Church the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, the Apo&s;tles, and Pa&s;tors, and Believers, might have put in their &s;eve|ral pleas for their &s;hares of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical power; but he doth not promi&s;e to give power to the <HI>Church,</HI> but to give power to <HI>Peter;</HI> and it would be very &s;trange if he &s;hould give power to <HI>Peter</HI> to judge an
<PB N="6" REF="001999_0036_0FBA573512F009A8">Offender as he was a Pa&s;tor, and yet further power to him as a Believer to give his Suffrage in the &s;ame ca&s;e among the Brethren.</P>
<P>The plain meaning of the Place is this, That as a reward of his hearty confe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t, Chri&s;t would be&s;tow on him the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven by making him an Officer in the Chri&s;tian Church. And its ab&s;urd &amp; ridiculous to ask whether he is made an Officer as an Officer, or as a Believer. It is all one as if we &s;hould ask whether the Staff be given to a Captain as a Captain, or as a common Souldier: or to ask whether the Office of a Gover|nour be given to him as a Governour, or as a Free|man. The giving the Keys to <HI>Peter</HI> gives Office|power to him; they are given unto him as one cho&s;en to &s;uch an Office.</P>
<P N="2">2. Arg. Is taken from 1 Tim. 5.17. <HI>Let the Elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour, e&s;pecial|ly they who labour in the Word &amp; Doctrine.</HI> Heb. 13 17. <HI>Obey them that have the rule over you, and &s;umbit your &s;elves, for they watch for your &s;ouls as they that mu&s;t give account.</HI></P>
<P>Con&s;ider 1. Who they are to whom this Honour &amp; Obedience mu&s;t be yielded, that are &s;tiled Rulers. And it is very evident that they are Elders, princi|pally if not only Teaching Elders: In Heb. 17.13. They are &s;aid to be tho&s;e <HI>that watch for their &s;ouls</HI> And v. 7. He &s;peaks of &s;uch Rulers, <HI>as have &s;poken to them in the Name of God.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. What their Duty is towards them; <HI>They are to they them,</HI> and to <HI>&s;ubmit to them.</HI> Whence we may ob&s;erve two things.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That the Elders are the only Rulers in the Church;
<PB N="7" REF="001999_0037_0FBA573694D45238">Ruling in the Church is appropriated to them.</HI> They are not called the Principal Rulers, but <HI>the Rulers.</HI> None el&s;e has any authority to joyn in Ruling When they are &s;aid to be the Rulers, it is exclu&s;ive of any other. They that are <HI>the Rulers</HI> are di&s;tingui&s;hed from them that are <HI>Ruled</HI> If Elders are the Rulers, then it is an Intru&s;ion for any other to intermeddle in Ruling. To Vote in matters of Rule is to Rule, therefore they that are not to Rule, are not to Vote. Elders being the only Rulers in the Church, they are to do every thing that is an act of Rule. It is an act of rule to call Offenders to an account, to Cen&s;ure them and Pardon them; &s;o to admit Members; therefore the&s;e Services are to be done by the Elders. For other Men to take upon them, to Vote in the&s;e ca&s;es, is to u&s;urp an authority that don't belong to them. Many are willing that the Elders &s;hould be Modera|tors to order Church Meetings, to order Speech and Silence, to put things to Vote; but Moderators are not Rulers. A Moderator in a Council, is not the Ru|ler of the Council. A private Man may be a Mode|rator in a Church, that has no Elder, when they con|vene to do what is proper for them, yet he is no Ru|ler, he is no Church Officer.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>They mu&s;t be Obeyed &amp; &s;ubmitted unto; the Church and every Member of it mu&s;t be &s;ubject to their Govern|ment.</HI> But if the Brethren have power to Vote in acts of government, then they have a liberty to obey or di&s;obey; and particular per&s;ons are only to obey the Elders in ca&s;e there be a concurrence of the Brethren with them If the Elders mu&s;t be obeyed they mu&s;t not be controuled or over ruled by them. There be other titles given to the Elders importing the &s;ame.
<PB N="8" REF="001999_0038_0FBA5739710D24E8">They are called <HI>Pa&s;tors</HI> or <HI>Shepherd;</HI> and &s;o have a government over the Sheep: the Sheep are not &s;it to govern them&s;elves. They are Over&s;eers or Bi&s;hops <HI>Acts</HI> 20.28. The care of the Church is committed unto them.</P>
<P N="3">3. Arg. <HI>The Mini&s;ters of the Jewi&s;h Church were the &s;ole judges in Spiritual cau&s;es.</HI> Sometimes al&s;o they were made judges in Civil Cau&s;es, becau&s;e they were &s;uitably qualified. 1 Chron. 26.29, 30. And <HI>of the Iz|harites, Chenaniah &amp; his Sons, were for the outward bu|&s;ine&s;s over I&s;rael, for officers &amp; judges. And of the He|bronites, Ha&s;habiah and his brethren, men of valour, a thou&s;and &amp; &s;even hundred, were officers among them of I&s;rael on this &s;ide Jordan we&s;tward, in all bu&s;ine&s;s of the Lord, and in the &s;ervice of the king.</HI> So in the follow|ing ver&s;es. But the Mini&s;ters and they alone were judges in &s;piritual cau&s;es. It is probable from &s;ome places of Scripture, that &s;ome Men of other Tribes were admitted to the Mini&s;try in I&s;rael. The Phari|&s;ees were of any Tribe, and they were allowed to be Teachers. Mat. 23.2, 3. <HI>The Scribes &amp; Phari&s;ees &s;et in Mo&s;es &s;eat, all therefore that they bid you ob&s;erve, that ob&s;erve &amp; do.</HI> And it is probable that they were the Mini&s;ters in &s;ome of the Synagogues, and did other acts of Office in admitting Pro&s;elytes, and &s;itting in judgment on offenders. Mat. 23.15. <HI>Wo to you Scribes and Phari&s;ees, Hypocrites, for you compa&s;s &s;ea &amp; land to make one Pro&s;elyte.</HI> Acts 23.6. <HI>Paul perceived that one part of the council were Sadduces, and the other Phari|&s;ees</HI> Yet the&s;e two things are &s;ure.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That the government of the Church of I&s;rael was not a popular government.</HI> The common &s;ort of People had no judgment in Eccle&s;ia&s;tical cau&s;es. Concer|ning
<PB N="9" REF="001999_0039_0FBA5751ED19AF50">either Moral or Ceremonial uncleanne&s;s. There is not one tittle in the word of God that Men were ei|ther condemned or pardoned by the Vote of the People.</P>
<P N="2">2. That the Prie&s;ts &amp; Levites were the judges in &s;piritual cau&s;es. 2 Chron. 19.8. <HI>He &s;et of the Prie&s;ts &amp; Levites, and of the chief of the Fathers in I&s;rael, for the judgment of the Lord, &amp; for controver&s;ies.</HI> And he tells them, <HI>v.</HI> 11. <HI>That Amaziah the chief Priest was over them in all matters of the Lord, and Zebadiah the Ruler of the hou&s;e of I&s;rael in the Kings matters.</HI> And in dif|ficult ca&s;es they were to carry their appeal to the place that God &s;hould chu&s;e; if it were an Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical Ca&s;e to the Prie&s;ts, and if it were a Civil to the Judge, and there the thing was to be finally i&s;&s;ued. <HI>Deut.</HI> 17. from <HI>v.</HI> 7. to 12. And in the ca&s;e of Lepro&s;y, the Man was to be pronounced clean or un|clean by the Prie&s;t. Lev. 13.3 <HI>The Prie&s;t &s;hall look up|on him &amp; pronounce him unclean.</HI> And v. 6. <HI>And the Prie&s;t &s;hall pronounce him clean.</HI> So in the ca&s;e of an unclean hou&s;e, Lev. 14.48. <HI>Then the Prie&s;t &s;hall pro|nounce the hou&s;e clean, becau&s;e the plague is healed.</HI> So the Prie&s;t was to value the unclean bea&s;t that a Man would redeem. Lev. 27.11, 12. <HI>He &s;hall pre&s;ent the bea&s;t before the Prie&s;t, and the Prie&s;t &s;hall value it, whether it be good or bad, as thou value&s;t it who art the Prie&s;t &s;o &s;hall it be.</HI> And if the judgment in Eccle&s;ia&s;tical cau&s;es did belong unto the Mini&s;ters of the Jewi&s;h Church, there is the like rea&s;on that it &s;hould belong unto the Mini&s;ters of the Chri&s;tian Church Mini&s;ters are now by their Function to perform all &s;piritual Offices in the Church. It was the Mini&s;ters work of old to ble&s;s the People, &s;o it is now; it was the Mini&s;ters work of old to teach the People, &s;o it is now; it was the Mini&s;ters work then to put up Publick Prayers, &s;o it
<PB N="10" REF="001999_0040_0FBA57548EB5EA38">is now; it was the Mini&s;ters work of old to judge in Spiritual cau&s;es, &s;o it is now: Men yeild the ca&s;e, only they &s;ay, <HI>That the Multitude have a Negative voice, and if they think meet may &s;top their proceedings.</HI> As if the People were to have more privilege &amp; power un|der the Go&s;pel, and the Mini&s;ter have le&s;s. As if the Jewi&s;h People were not qualified to have an hand in the government, &amp; Chri&s;tian Mini&s;ters were unqua|lified to govern without the Suffrage of the People. As if the Jewi&s;h Church were more unhappy than the Chri&s;tian in re&s;pect of the ignorance or unfaith|fulne&s;s of the People, and the Chri&s;tian more unhap|py in re&s;pect of the ignorance or unfaithfulne&s;s of their Mini&s;ters.</P>
<P N="4">4. Arg. <HI>The Community are not fit to judge &amp; rule in the Church.</HI> They mu&s;t be Men of under&s;tanding that are to judge in Civil cau&s;es. Exod. 18.21. <HI>Thou &s;halt provide out of all the People able men.</HI> Deut. 1.13. <HI>Take you wi&s;e men &amp; under&s;tanding, and known among your Tribes, &amp; I will make them rulers over you.</HI> There is a great deal of intricacy many times in cau&s;es, &amp; many things are offered to blind the eyes: there may be fair pretences for foul actions. Sometimes it is difficult to find out matter of fact; &s;ometimes to find out mat|ter of law. So that there is great need of under&s;tand|ing. <HI>Solomon</HI> prayed for wi&s;dom to judge I&s;rael, and I&s;rael took notice <HI>that the wi&s;dom of God was in him to do judgment,</HI> 1 King. 3. <HI>ult.</HI> But the Community are not men of under&s;tanding. Wi&s;e Men are but here &amp; there to be found. Many of them have not had the advantage of Reading &amp; Study. Some of them are Men of very weak Abilities, &s;ome of them are ra&s;h, &s;ome of them are Young, hardly Sixteen Years of Age, &s;o me of them are Servants; a crafty man may lead a
<PB N="11" REF="001999_0041_0FBA57561BC3AE68">Score of them by the No&s;e; they are uncapable to &s;ee into an ab&s;tru&s;e thing. Let the government be put into their hands, &amp; things will be carryed head-long by a tumultuous cry. If the Multitude were to be judges in Civil cau&s;es, things would quickly be tur|ned up &s;ide down. We have many examples in the Scripture of the ungovernable Spirit of the Multitude. When Chri&s;t Je&s;us &s;tood before <HI>Pilate, they cryed out, Crucify him, crucify him.</HI> When <HI>Stephen</HI> pleaded his ca&s;e, <HI>they lift up their voice &amp; &s;topped their ears, &amp; ran upon him with one accord.</HI> When <HI>Paul</HI> made his de|fence, <HI>they lift up their voice &amp; &s;aid, Away with &s;uch a fellow, it is not fit that he &s;hould live.</HI> We have no rea|&s;on to think that Chri&s;t would intru&s;t the govern|ment of His Church with Men &s;o uncapable to go|vern. We read <HI>of the cry of him that ruleth among fools.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. Arg. <HI>They that are impowred by Christ to judge who are di&s;ciples, have power to judge in other cau&s;es Ec|clefia&s;tical; but Mini&s;ters are to judge who are di&s;ciples.</HI> Mat. 28.19. <HI>Go therefore &amp; teach all Nations baptizing them.</HI> The word rendred <HI>Teach,</HI> is, <HI>Di&s;ciple them;</HI> and when that was done, then they were to Baptize them. They were not to ask the Church for liberty to Baptize them, and if the Church were unwilling, then to neglect it; but when they Di&s;cipled them, they were to Baptize them. If the command had been to Bap|tize tho&s;e that the Church Voted to be di&s;ciples, they ought to have taken a Vote for it: but if the com|mand be to Baptize di&s;ciples, they are made the judges who are di&s;ciples. There is the like rea&s;on for other acts of Office: becau&s;e they are to give the Lords-Supper to qualifyed Per&s;ons, therefore they are to judge who are qualifyed; and becau&s;e they are to cen&s;ure impenitent Offenders, they are to judge who
<PB N="12" REF="001999_0042_0FBA575865E687A8">are impenitent Offenders; and becau&s;e they are to forgive them that are Penitent, they are to judge who are Penitent <HI>Paul</HI> Baptized the Jailor &amp; his Family, &amp; <HI>Lydia</HI> without the con&s;ent of any Church. <HI>Philip</HI> Baptized the Eunuch, and <HI>Peter</HI> Baptized <HI>Cornelius</HI> without the con&s;ent of any Church. <HI>Paul</HI> Excom|municated <HI>Hymeneus &amp; Alexander,</HI> 1 Tim. 1.20. but there is no intimation that he had the con&s;ent of the Church. It may be pleaded, <HI>That Paul was an Apo|&s;tle, &amp; had extraordinary power.</HI> Yet it mu&s;t be yielded that then the Brethren have power of Suffrage only in &s;ome ca&s;es, &amp; that their con&s;ent is not nece&s;|&s;ary to the validity of the act.</P>
<P N="6">6.

If it had been by the Suffrage of many, that would have been no evidence of the &s;uffici|ency of his puni&s;hment, it would not been the heavier for the con&s;ent of the Brethren. But this is an argu|ment of the heavine&s;s of it, that it was a Publick puni&s;h|ment, that he was put to open &s;hame; he was puni&s;hed in the pre&s;ence of the whole Congregation. <HI>Paul</HI> had directed &s;o, that they &s;hould be gathered together, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.4. Whereby he was expo&s;ed to the greater &s;hame.</P>

<P N="1">1. That they give the reproof to the People of I&s;rael, in &s;uch ca&s;es, where the Rulers were the Per&s;ons in fault.

<P N="2">2. That Commands are &s;et down generally, when the Rulers are particularly intended.

And that acts of Ju&s;tice were to be done by the Suffrage of the Multitude.</P>
<P N="4">4 Obj. <HI>The taking away of the power of Brethren is the way to let Corruption into the Church.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> 1. There never was any way of government, pro|pounded by God and invented by Man, that hath pro|vailed to keep Corruption out of the Church. In a little while mo&s;t Churches have &s;en&s;ibly declined. The Church of I&s;rael, notwith&s;tanding the order which they were put into by God him&s;elf, grew corrupt in a little time.</P>
<P N="2">2. If the Rulers &amp; Teachers of a People grow corrupt, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> of Brethren will be a poor defence again&s;t
<PB N="16" REF="001999_0046_0FBA57666A82B0C0">Corruptions. If Magi&s;trates &amp; Mini&s;ters grow corrupt, the People are not like to hold their Integrity long. If the be&s;t &s;ort of Men grow corrupt, they that are wont to be inferiour to them in Piety, will joyn in the Corrup|tion. Jer. 5.31. <HI>The Prophets prophe&s;y fal&s;ely, and the Prie&s;ts bear rule by their means, and my People love to have it &s;o.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Humane inventions are not like to keep the Church pure. In Old <HI>England</HI> many Ceremonies are attended under an apprehen&s;ion that they are for decency and to increa&s;e Devotion. And in <HI>New-England</HI> &s;ome methods are taken to prevent Corruption &amp; promote Edification. But it don't become Men to reflect upon the wi&s;dom of God, as if they had under&s;tanding to mend His In&s;titutions.</P>
<P N="5">5 Obj. <HI>The taking away the power of the Brethren, &s;eems to exalt the Mini&s;ter too much, and to degrade the People as if they were very in&s;ignificant Per&s;ons; Whereas &s;ome Mini&s;ters are weak, and &s;ome of the Brethren be Men of very good Abilities.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> 1. The Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel are hereby no more exalted than the Mini&s;ters of the Jewi&s;h Church; nei|ther are the People deba&s;ed any lower than the People of the Jewi&s;h Church. The Tribe of Judah was very honourable, yet it is &s;aid that of it, <HI>No man gave atten|dance at the Altar,</HI> Heb. 7.13.</P>
<P N="2">2. This doth no more exalt the Mini&s;ter or deba&s;e the Brethren, than the confining of Preaching to the Mini|&s;ter. Preaching &s;eems to be a Service of more dignity than governing, yet People don't take it hardly that the Mini&s;ter only has the liberty of the Pulpit. It is no great honour to an able Brother, to have as good a Vote in the Church as a Man that can neither Write nor Read. If any of the Brethren be Men of Ability, there are other ways wherein they may u&s;e their Ta|lents; and if the Mini&s;ter have five times the Ability as &s;ome others, he will not think much to be debarred a Vote in Civil Affairs.</P>
<P>This Matter being thus cleared, there is no occa&s;ion for that Controver&s;y, <HI>Whether the Votes of the Fraternity in a Council are of equal authority with the Votes of the Elders?</HI></P>
