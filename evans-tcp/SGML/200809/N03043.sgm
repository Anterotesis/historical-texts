<P>THE two main defects of wit, to which all others may be reduced, are <HI>Error</HI> and <HI>Ignorance</HI>; by <HI>Igno|rance</HI> we know not things nere&s;|&s;ary; by <HI>Error</HI> we know them fal&s;ely. <HI>Ig|norance</HI> is a privation, <HI>Error</HI> is a po&s;itive act.

Error in Judgment is wor&s;e than Error in Practice, for then the Con&s;cience takes part with Sin, and a man thinks he ought to do what he doth.</P>
<P>Every Error is a plot of the Devil to &s;up|pre&s;s &s;ome Truth, and is very &s;preading &amp; infectious: this is the mo&s;t remarkable evil our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour takes notice of, <HI>Mat.</HI> 24 and that no le&s;s than three times <HI>ver.</HI> 5,

<P>I. <HI>To deny the morality of the fourth Com|mandment is a very &s;trange doctrine.</HI> There are a &s;ort of creatures ri&s;en up, who (in o|pen defiance to the great God and all good order) live in the con&s;tant breach of an ex|pre&s;s divine Law, by denying the morality of the fourth Commandment, &amp; ca&s;hiering it among other Levitical Rites and Cere|monies. For confutation of this Error, we may here,</P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> That all the Laws given in the old Te&s;tament, are to be di&s;tingui&s;hed in regard of their continuance, into the&s;e two &s;orts, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>(1) <HI>Perpetual,</HI> binding all men in all ages.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="003659_0017_1002026E6830B628">
Or,</P>
<P>(2) <HI>Temporary,</HI> binding only &s;uch as lived before the Re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t; for the Will of the Legi&s;lator (which is the very o|riginal of all that force, extent, and conti|nuance that the Law hath) was that &s;ome Precepts &s;hould be ob&s;erved only till the Re&s;urrection of the promi&s;ed Me&s;&s;iah, and no longer, and that others &s;hould continue in force from the fir&s;t promulgation of them to the end of time. Now the Que&s;tion is, Which of the&s;e kinds is the fourth Com|mandment of? and to this I an&s;wer, That it belongs to the former &s;ort, and is bind|ing to all men in all ages; as may appear by con&s;idering the following particulars.</P>
<P>[1] <HI>Con&s;ider</HI> Adam <HI>had no Precept given him in innocency, but what was of perpetual obli|gation</HI>: But this Precept was then given un|to man, therefore it is perpetual; the major propo&s;ition is evident thus, that all the Pre|cepts then given to <HI>Adam</HI> were moral and not ceremonial, for there was then no &s;in, and &s;o no need of a Saviour, &amp; con&s;equent|ly no u&s;e of ceremonies to &s;ignify the one or typify the other; and the minor is plain from <HI>Gen</HI> 2. 2.</P>
<P>[2] <HI>It is apparent that it was the real inten|tion of the &s;upreme and ab&s;olute Lawgiver, that this Precept &s;hould bind all men to the Worlds end.</HI> 
<PB N="16" REF="003659_0018_10023F5A33C82E08">
For how could the great God declare his mind in this behalf more plainly than by equalling it in all things with tho&s;e Precepts which all men mu&s;t own to be of everla&s;t|ing obligation. And by &s;eparating it wholly from, nay exalting it far above all tho&s;e which are on all hands acknowleged to be but Temporary.</P>
<P>(1) <HI>This Precept</HI> was promulgated in the &s;ame maje&s;tick manner, with the &s;ame voice, at the &s;ame time, and in the &s;ame place that the other nine were.</P>
<P>(2) <HI>It was delivered to the &s;ame Per&s;on,</HI> to be laid up in the &s;ame Ark, and &s;o is a part of the &s;ame Covenant, whence tho&s;e Tables are called the Tables of the Covenant, and that Ark the Ark of the Covenant. Whence it may be thus argued.</P>
<P>What Commandment &s;oever is a part of eternal Covenant, and is by God graced and commended with all tho&s;e &s;igns of com|mendation wherewith all the re&s;t are gra|ced, cannot be made of le&s;s continuance than the re&s;t (who&s;e perpetuity is &s;ignified by their being written on Tables of Stone, and being laid up in the Ark.)</P>
<P>But thus it is with re&s;pect to the fourth Commandment. Therefore, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>(3) <HI>The ble&s;&s;ed God him&s;elf</HI> hath &s;eparated this from all temporary Precepts, by giving
<PB N="17" REF="003659_0019_10023F5C961A4B70">
it tho&s;e privileges, as it were, and notes of honour, which all of them wanted; and he hath equalled it with the perpetual &amp; ever|la&s;ting Precepts, by communicating to it all tho&s;e te&s;timonies of force and continuance which they had; therefore we are bound to believe it was his holy will that this &s;hould continue in force as much and as long as the re&s;t, even to all men in all ages till time &s;hall be no more.</P>
<P>[3] <HI>Con&s;ider how unrea&s;onable, nay what a vile reflection it is on the Divine Wi&s;dom,</HI> for any to think that God would put a ceremo|nial and temporary law in the very mid&s;t of moral and perpetual Precepts, and urge it with more rea&s;ons, words, repetitions and particulars than any of tho&s;e morals, as he plainly doth in <HI>Exod.</HI> 20. 8, 9.</P>
<P>[4] <HI>Con&s;ider to deny the morality &amp; perpa|tuity of this Precept,</HI> is to take away one of the ten and &s;o leave but nine, which is con|trary to the expre&s;s word of God, in Deut. 10. 4. <HI>And he wrote on the Tables according to the fir&s;t writing, the ten Commandments, which the Lord &s;pake unto you in the mount,</HI> &amp;c. And how our Adver&s;aries can an&s;wer this I know not, unle&s;s they betake them&s;elves to the &s;ame poor &s;hift with the Papi&s;ts, who when they raze out the &s;econd Commandment, be|cau&s;e it is expre&s;ly again&s;t their Idolatry, 
<PB N="18" REF="003659_0020_10023F5EF35E44C0">
they divide the tenth into two to maintain the number.</P>
<P>[5] <HI>Con&s;ider all tho&s;e Laws in the Jewi&s;h Church,</HI> that were ceremonial and temporary, were accompli&s;hed in Chri&s;t, and abrogated by him; but it was not &s;o with re&s;pect un|to this Commandment, for we find plainly that this Precept was &s;till to continue in force under the Go&s;pel; as appears briefly by the&s;e things,</P>
<P>(1) The Prophet <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> foretelling the days of the Go&s;pel when Chri&s;t &s;hould be <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> (<HI>I&s;ai. ch.</HI> 56.) he pronounces a ble&s;&s;ing on them in tho&s;e days that keep the Sabbath from polluting it, (<HI>v.</HI> 2.) nay he puts the keeping of the Sabbath for the whole obedience of the Covenant (<HI>v.</HI> 6) which he would never do had it been no more than temporary.</P>
<P>(2) We accordingly find our ble&s;&s;ed Sa|viour him&s;elf, when &s;peaking of tho&s;e days wherein all the ceremonial Law was dead and buried, <HI>viz</HI> &s;everal years after his own Re&s;urrection &amp; A&s;cention, when <HI>Titus Ve&s;|pa&s;ian</HI> &s;hould de&s;troy Jeru&s;alem, he &s;ays, Mat. 24. 20 <HI>Pray that your flight be not in the winter, nor on the Sabbath day,</HI> plainly &s;hew|ing that the Sabbath was to continue after the legal Ceremonies cea&s;ed,</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="003659_0021_10023F61622F5F90">
(3) The &s;ame point concerning the per|petuity of this Law is plainly confirmed by <HI>James</HI> after Chri&s;t's A&s;cention: &s;ee <HI>Jam.</HI> 2 to where he &s;ays, <HI>He that keepeth the whole Law, and faileth but in one point, is guilty of all.</HI> Whence we may thus rea&s;on, The whole Law, and every part of it, was in force when <HI>James</HI> wrote this Epi&s;tle, for how can a man break a Law that is abrogared, or be guilty of all by breaking any one point, if the whole, and every point of it he not e|qually in force. Now this Epi&s;tle was writ|ten by <HI>James</HI> to &s;uch as lived under the Go&s;pel. Wherefore at that time and to tho&s;e Per&s;ons, the whole Law, &amp; every part and point of it was in force And if any doubt what <HI>James</HI> means by the Law, it is plain he meaneth the decalogue or ten Com|mandments, thus, He that &s;peaketh of a whole Law, and after in&s;tanceth in particu|lar members of the Law, mu&s;t needs mean the whole number of Precepts, whereof the&s;e two bro't for in&s;tance are members and parts. Now for in&s;tance <HI>James</HI> brings in two members of the decalogue. There|fore by the whole Law, and each point, he mu&s;t needs mean the decalogue and every precept thereof, as &s;till farther appears by his manner of &s;peaking and rea&s;oning, when as &s;ays thus, <HI>He that &s;aid, Thou &s;halt not

commit adultery, &s;aid al&s;o, Thou &s;halt not kill, if then thou commit not adultery, but kille&s;t, thou art a tran&s;gre&s;&s;or of the Law.</HI> Here we have an imperfect &s;yllogi&s;m, or a plain Enthymem, and a propo&s;ition mu&s;t needs be under&s;tood to make up the Argument, and having one propo&s;ition and the conclu&s;ion, no man that hath rea&s;on can choo&s;e but add the propo|&s;ition under&s;tood, thus or to this effect, <HI>viz.</HI> What things were &s;poken by the &s;ame Law|giver, do bind &s;o equally, that though a man keep one of them, and yet break ano|ther, he is a tran&s;gre&s;&s;or of that Law given by that Lawgiver. Now the&s;e two, <HI>thou &s;halt not commit adultery,</HI> and <HI>thou &s;halt not kill,</HI> were &s;o &s;poken: And may not one add to the &s;ame propo&s;ition, but this, <HI>thou &s;halt &s;anctify the Sabbath,</HI> was &s;o &s;poken, &amp; &s;o con|clude. Therefore if thou keep all the re&s;t and break this, thou art a tran&s;gre&s;&s;or. It is therefore from this place clearly manife&s;t, that the fourth Commandment as well as any other point of the Law is now in force.</P>
<P>There is one Argument that has &s;ome &s;hew of weight, which &s;ome make u&s;e of to overthrow this truth of the perpetuity of the fourth Commandment, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>That by our practice we declare our &s;elves now not bound to do the thing re|quired in this Precept, nay that we are 
<PB N="21" REF="003659_0023_10023F665916C678">
bound not to do it; Ina&s;much as our Sabbath is not the Seventh, but the Highth from the Creation. To which it may be An&s;wered.</P>
<P>That this Fourth Commandment does not require us to Re&s;t, and Sanctify the Se|venth, from the Creation, nor from any o|ther period of Time, but alone the Seventh Day after Six of Labour, or coming betwixt Six of Labour; in a &s;etled Cour&s;e of num|bering from any Period that God &s;hould ap|point; and &s;o in the meaning of the Com|mandment, we now do, and ever mu&s;t Re&s;t the Seventh Day: For that is the Seventh in order of numbering, which doth &s;till come betwixt Six, having Six before it, and Six after it continually, &amp; &s;o our Day of Re&s;t hath, and therefore we al&s;o Re&s;t the Seventh Day. It is true indeed the Period, from which the Chri&s;tian Church taketh the beginning of her Account is not the &s;ame, but another different from that which was the beginning of the Jewi&s;h Account; for they reckoned from the beginning of the Creation, &amp; &s;o for|ward: We from the Re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t, and &s;o forward; but ours is as truely and &s;urely the Seventh, as theirs, tho' reckoned from another Period; and as to the Period, from whence the account mu&s;t be made, we have no word at all of it in this Precept. The Law-giver &s;aith not, Six Days from the

Creation thou&s;halt labour, &amp; the &s;eventh from the Creation is the Sabbath of the Lord, in it thou &s;halt do no work: but, Six days &s;halt thou labour: And he faith not afterwards, The Lord ble&s;&s;ed and &s;anctified the &s;eventh day from the Creation, but the Sabbath day, that is the &s;eventh after &s;ix of labour Indeed the Lord by a &s;pecial in&s;titution giv|en to <HI>Adam, Gen.</HI> 2. 1. had for the times before Chri&s;t appointed that they &s;hould reckon from the Creation, which was the cau&s;e of the &s;pecial in&s;titution, but this is no part of the Commandment; and the pe|riod from which we take the beginning of our account hath as Divine and as Special an In&s;titution, as &s;hall appear anon.</P>
<P>II. <HI>The denial of the Change of the Sabbath, from the La&s;t to the Fir&s;t day of the Week, un|der the Go&s;pel is a &s;trange Doctrine</HI>: And the fal&s;hood of this may appear from the fol|lowing particulars.</P>
<P>(1) <HI>We have &s;ever ai intimctions of this change of the Day in the Old Te&s;timent.</HI> The Jewi&s;h Sabbath was the Seventh in order from the Creation, and &s;o the one immediately fol|lowing it was the eighth day in the &s;ame order of reckoning; now let us but take no|tice what &s;pecial regard was had to an eighth day under the legal di&s;pen&s;ation, 
<PB N="23" REF="003659_0025_10023F6B2E1689C8">
and &s;ee what may to our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e be deduced from it; and we find Circumoi|&s;ion was to be performed on the eighth day, <HI>Gen</HI> 17 12. The fir&s;tlings of the &s;locks and berds were to be &s;even days with the dam, and on the eighth day to be given to God. In clean&s;ing the Lepro&s;y, the per&s;on was to carry out of his Tent &s;even days, and on the eighth day he was to come and offer his gifts according to divine In&s;titution, <HI>Lev.</HI> 14. 10. So at the fea&s;t of In-gathering, on the fir&s;t day was to be a Sabbath, and on the eighth day a Sabbath, <HI>Lev.</HI> 23. 39. concern|ing which we may particularly remark both the numbers as holding forth a Sabbath to some, which &s;hould be both the fir&s;t &amp; the eighth day, the fir&s;t in the weekly account, and the eighth, as following the &s;eventh which was the Jewi&s;h Sabbath. But to come to that which is yet more plain, in <HI>Numb.</HI> 19. 12, <HI>to</HI> 36. we have the manner of the lea&s;t of Tabernacles, during &s;even days and the particular offerings of every day, then in <HI>v.</HI> 35. we find that the eighth day was a great holiday; now as the offering referred to Chri&s;t as the &s;ub&s;tance, why not this eighth day al&s;o? the whole intimating to us, that after the Me&s;&s;iah &s;hould offer up Him&s;elf once for all, the eighth day, <HI>i. e.</HI> the day after the &s;eventh which was the <HI>J</HI>ewi&s;h

Sabbath, &s;hould be the Day whereon &s;hould be a &s;olemn A&s;&s;embly. Again farther, Our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour calls him&s;elf the Tem|ple, and he was no doubt prefigured by it; now we find in 2 Chron 7. 8. that <HI>Solomon kept the fea&s;t of dedication &s;even days,</HI> and in ver. 9. <HI>On the eighth day they made a &s;olemn a&s;&s;embly</HI>; intimating that when Chri&s;t, the true Temple, &s;hould by his own power be rai&s;ed up, then the eighth day, <HI>i. e.</HI> the day after the Jewi&s;h &s;eventh, &s;hould be ob&s;er|ved, and that not only once but continually, as we &s;ee in the Ordinance of the new Tem|ple. Ezek. 43. 27. <HI>And when the&s;e days are expired, it &s;hall be that on the eighth day and &s;o forward, the prie&s;ts &s;hall make their burnt offer|ings on the altar.</HI> Thus al&s;o in the re&s;toring of Religion to its primitive purity under the reign of good <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> the Prie&s;ts on a fir&s;t eighth day &s;anctify the Porch, and on a &s;econd eighth day made an end of &s;ancti|fying the Lord's hou&s;e, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 29. 17.

But becau&s;e this may be looked upon as no conclu&s;ive way of arguing (tho' for my own part I cannot &s;ee what could be held forth or intimated by &s;uch a &s;pecial regard had to the eighth

<P>[1] Mention is made of the Seventh|Day-Sabbath, together with one rea&s;on of its in&s;titution, ver. 4. <HI>For he &s;pake in a certain place of the &s;eventh day on this wi&s;e, And God did re&s;t the &s;eventh day from all his works.</HI></P>
<P>[2] He tells us of <HI>another day</HI> (<HI>viz.</HI> di&s;|tinct from the &s;eventh day before-mention|ed) that was &s;poken of, <HI>ver.</HI> 8.</P>
<P>[3] He more particularly tells us what day that other day is, namely, the Day wherein Chri&s;t re&s;ted from his Work, which was the <HI>fir&s;t day of the week,</HI> whereon by his Re&s;urrection he compleated the Work of Redemption.</P>
<P>[4] He fairly intimates the appointment of this other Day in commemoration of the Son's re&s;ting; and that by giving us the like rea&s;on for the appointment of this other (or fir&s;t) Day as there was for the &s;eventh; the rea&s;on of God's appointing the &s;eventh day, was his re&s;ting from his Works of Creation; and there is a like rea&s;on for appointing the fir&s;t day, which was the day of Chri&s;t's

<P>(1) <HI>Not the former</HI>: For &s;uch a day of Chri&s;t's &s;pecial appearing not being named here, it would leave the Church at the ut|mo&s;t uncertainty to know what day was hereby intended; whereas the very &s;cope and de&s;ign of mentioning this Day is to point it out from other days; be&s;ides, if it were any &s;uch day, it would point at no one day; for there are many times of Chri&s;t's appearing; or even thus it would mo&s;t di|rectly point (it at any) to the fir&s;t day of the week, as a day (well known to the Church) whereon Chri&s;t mo&s;t frequently after his Re&s;urrection appeared to his Di&s;ciples.</P>
