<HEAD>TRAVELS OF <HI>JONAS HANWAY,</HI> ESQ.</HEAD>
<P>JONAS HANWAY, E&s;q. &s;o di&s;tingui&s;h|ed as a philanthropi&s;t and a real Chri&s;|tian, was born at Port&s;mouth on the 12th of Augu&s;t, 1712. His father was an naval offi|cer; but lo&s;ing his life at an early age by an accident, the care of rearing and educating the family devolved on the mother, who put Jonas to &s;chool in London, where he acquired &s;uch branches of learning as might qualify him for a commercial life, and made &s;ome proficiency in Latin.</P>
<P>At the age of &s;eventeen, he was bound apprentice to a merchant in Li&s;bon, where he &s;erved his time with great credit to him&s;elf and &s;atisfaction to his ma&s;ter Soon after he returned to London, and accepted the offer of a partner&s;hip in the hou&s;e of Dingly, a merchant at Peter&s;burgh, who was engaged in a Per&s;ian trade through Ru&s;&s;ia.</P>
<P>In this capacity he performed the travels which form the &s;ubject of the following pages. His work early obtained celebrity; and the character of the man gave the &s;tamp of authenticity to his de&s;criptions, and of &s;o|lidity to his remarks.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="035585_0003_10056C1123E0F3A8">Mr. Hanway, having clo&s;ed his commer|cial engagements, took up his re&s;idence in London, where he employed his time in literary pur&s;uits, and in the far more valua|ble occupations, of di&s;intere&s;ted benevolence and public-&s;pirited &s;ervices.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to follow him through all his charitable and prai&s;e-worthy undertak|ings. His country and mankind were bet|tered by his various exertions in their behalf; and he lived to reap the applau&s;e that was due to him. Honoured and re&s;pected, he clo&s;ed this tran&s;itory life on the 5th of September, 1786, in the &s;eventy-fifth year of his age.</P>
<P>We now proceed to his travels. In April 1743, he embarked from the port of Lon|don for Riga. On his arrival there, about the end of May, he was carried pri&s;oner to the Ca&s;tle of Dwenamund, becau&s;e he had come without a regular pa&s;&s;port, though it was not cu&s;tomary to carry one. However, having letters of recommendation from the Ru&s;&s;ian amba&s;&s;ador, at the court of London, to the great chancellor of the empire, he was &s;oon liberated.</P>
<P>He found the weather here as hot as it generally is in Portugal; for the &s;un, at this &s;ea&s;on, &s;inking below the horizon only for three or four hours, neither the earth nor the air had time to cool.</P>
<P>Mr. Hanway was received with great kindne&s;s by the Briti&s;h factors at Riga; but as a war at this time &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the Swedes and Ru&s;&s;ians, the governor had re|ceived
<PB N="5" REF="035585_0004_10056C13E3332B60">
expre&s;s orders to &s;uffer no one to pro|ceed to Peter&s;burgh without the particular permi&s;&s;ion of the court. This being at length procured, Mr. Hanway provided him|&s;elf with a &s;leeping waggon, which is made of leather and hung upon braces, and in this manner he rode po&s;t to the capital.</P>
<P>Riga was founded about the year 1190, when this country fir&s;t embraced Chri&s;tiani|ty. It is the metropolis of Livonia, and was taken from the Swedes by Peter the Great in 1713. The chief commodities here are ma&s;ts, timber, flax, and hemp, with which a con&s;iderable number of &s;hips are annually la|den. The hou&s;es are built with &s;teep roofs, and are &s;eldom above two &s;tories high. The German language is generally &s;poken here.</P>
<P>Having pa&s;&s;ed through &s;everal incon&s;idera|ble places, Mr. Hanway arrived at Narva, the capital of E&s;thonia, famous for the bat|tle fought here in 1700, when one hundred thou&s;and Ru&s;&s;ians fled before a handful of Swedes. This city &s;tands on a ri&s;ing ground, and is clean and well fortified, though not large. Its trade chiefly con&s;i&s;ts in hemp and timber.</P>
<P>Our author reached Peter&s;burgh on the 10th of June, and was much plea&s;ed with the general a&s;pect of the city. Soon after his arrival here, it was judged expedient that one of the partners, in the commercial hou&s;e to which he belonged, &s;hould proceed to Por&s;ia; and the intimation he received of the di&s;tracted &s;ituation of that country did not
<PB N="6" REF="035585_0005_10056C1578B092C0">
deter him from offering his &s;ervices, which were accepted.</P>
<P>Having obtained a pa&s;&s;port from the court of Ru&s;&s;ia, he provided a &s;leeping waggon, for him&s;elf, a &s;econd for his clerk, and a third for his baggage. He was al&s;o attended by a Ru&s;&s;ian &s;ervant, a Tartar boy, and a &s;oldier; and took upon him the charge of thirty-&s;even bales of Engli&s;h cloth, which was &s;ent for|ward on the 1&s;t of September, and on the 10th, Mr. Hanway followed it.</P>
<P>In two days he reached the river Volcoff, where the ferry-man, di&s;covering he was a merchant began to be in&s;olent; for the Ru&s;|&s;ian boors entertain no high re&s;pect for the commercial character. The &s;oldier, however, brought the fellow to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, by exer|ci&s;ing his cane, and our traveller was carried over in &s;afety.</P>
<P>On the 13th, one of the waggons &s;tuck in a mora&s;s, which obliged him to &s;pend the night in that &s;ituation Next day they reached Baanitz, near Novogorod, where they found the weather mild, and the roads open and plea&s;ant. Provi&s;ions were &s;o cheap, that beef might be purcha&s;ed for three farthings a pound, and matton and pork in proportion.</P>
<P>The 15th brought them to Valdal, the inhabitants of which are chiefly Poles, who were taken pri&s;oners in former wars; but the di&s;tinction between them and the original natives is almo&s;t lo&s;t. The dre&s;s of the wo|men, however, is nearer than the generality
<PB N="7" REF="035585_0006_10056C179BAF3050">
of the Ru&s;&s;ian pea&s;ants; but they greatly le&s;&s;en the effect of their per&s;onal charms by paint and giddine&s;s.</P>
<P>The &s;urrounding country is very plea&s;ant; and from the many love &s;ongs, which are here the delight of the Ru&s;&s;ians, it might be &s;uppo&s;ed that Venus had once fixed her re|&s;idence here; but the refined plea&s;ures are &s;carcely known among the pre&s;ent race.</P>
<P>The next day, Mr. Hanway overtook his carravan at Twere, and fearing that he might not be able to reach Per&s;ia &s;o &s;oon as he in|tended, he ordered an additional hor&s;e to be put to each carriage.</P>
<P>The Ru&s;&s;ian conveyances for merchandi&s;e are about ten feet long and three broad, principally compo&s;ed of two &s;trong poles, &s;upported by four &s;light wheels, nearly of an equal height. The bales are laid on a thick mat, and over them are placed other mats, with an outward covering of raw cow hides.</P>
<P>Twere is a very ancient city, &s;eated on the Twer&s;a, which runs into the Volga&punc; It is a great rendezvous for merchants, who carry on their traffic along the banks of the la&s;t-mentioned river.</P>
<P>On the 20th, Mr. Hanway arrived at Mo&s;cow, the ancient metropolis of the Ru&s;|&s;ian empire.</P>
<P>Among other grand projects of Peter the Great, was a road, to extend from Peter&s;|burgh to Mo&s;cow in a direct line, for the &s;pace of &s;even hundred and thirty-four ver&s;ts, or four hundred and eighty-&s;even Engli&s;h
<PB N="8" REF="035585_0007_10056C1B01F31988">
miles. This is in part executed, over &s;uch impediments as would have terrified a com|mon genious. For about one hundred and fifty ver&s;ts, it is wholly made of wood, laid over mora&s;&s;es, till then thought impa&s;&s;able.</P>
<P>Mo&s;cow &s;tands in 55 deg. 40 min. north latitude, and is built after the ea&s;tern man|ner, having few regular &s;teets, but many gardens mixed with the hou&s;es. It is &s;ix|teen Engli&s;h miles in circumference; and the river Mo&s;kwa meandering through it, adds greatly to its beauty and convenience,</P>
<P>The imperial palace is chiefly remarkable for its thirty chapels, and its pendant gar|den. The number of churches and chapels in this city almo&s;t exceeds credibility. They are &s;aid to amount to one thou&s;and eight hundred, but many of them are very mean.</P>
<P>The great bell of Mo&s;cow is at once a monument of art and folly. It weighs four hundred and forty-three thou&s;and &s;even hun|dred and &s;eventy-two pounds, and was ca&s;t in the reign of the late empre&s;s Anne; but the beam on which it hung being burnt, it fell to the ground, and &s;uffered con&s;iderable damage.</P>
<P>This city is the general re&s;idence of the Ru&s;&s;ian nobility, who are not obliged to fol|low the court; and it contains the chief mer|chants and manufacturers of the empire. The dreadful conflagrations which have re|peatedly happened here, and the removal of the court, have united to dimini&s;h the gran|deur and extent of this place; and now there
<PB N="9" REF="035585_0008_10056C1D171001C8">
is &s;carcely accommodations for the imperial retinue, without di&s;tre&s;&s;ing the people.</P>
<P>Having made the requi&s;ite preparations, on the 24th of September, Mr. Hanway left Mo&s;cow, and pa&s;&s;ed through a picture&s;que and plea&s;ant country, till he arived at Peri&s;|lawl, where he found him&s;elf in another cli|mate: for the harve&s;t here was not yet ga|thered in. The pro&s;pects are delightful, and the &s;oil is well watered, but the inhabitants exhibit proofs of indigence and di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Traver&s;ing a plea&s;ant country by good roads, on the 1&s;t of October he entered the Step, where he overtook a caravan, con&s;i&s;ting of forty loads of European goods, belonging to Armenian merchants Next day he ar|rived at Novochoper&s;kaja, the Ru&s;&s;ian fron|tier towards the Don Co&s;&s;acks, which is in|differently fortified, and is almo&s;t hid in a grove of oaks. The adjacent country is ve|ry delightful, and the travelling commodi|ous.</P>
<P>In the Co&s;&s;ack towns, the people appeared neat in their per&s;ons and comfortably cloth|ed. The woman were gay and comely; they wore a high cap, with two points, in the form of a cre&s;cent; and their &s;hifts were ornamented with red cro&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>In travelling through the Co&s;&s;ack country for three days, Mr Hanway &s;aw little more than land and &s;ky, except &s;ome woods which covered the mountains to the ea&s;tward. At length they arrived at Grigori&s;koi which,
<PB N="10" REF="035585_0009_10056C1E99E418F8">
forms a kind of penin&s;ula. Here the inhabi|tants catch va&s;t numbers of craw-fi&s;h, and ex|port the eyes for medicinal purpo&s;es. They dwell in oaken huts, and marry very young. Our author &s;aw a boy of fifteen contracted to a girl of the &s;ame age.</P>
<P>On the morning of the 9th, they arrived under the lines that are thrown up from the Don to the Volga, for the di&s;tance of fifty ver&s;ts. The fo&s;s is about &s;ixteen feet deep, and a mound of earth ri&s;es to the height of twenty feet, with a &s;trong wooden rail near the top. At certain di&s;tances are placed &s;entry-boxes, from which the guard can com|municate an alarm to the chief garri&s;on at Zaritzen, which terminates the line on the we&s;tern bank of the Volga. On this &s;pot Peter I intended to join the Don with the Volga, and this canal was actually begun for that purpo&s;e; but it now &s;erves as a defence again&s;t the incur&s;ions of the Tartars on that &s;ide</P>
<P>The Kuban Tartars were once very for|midable; but they are now kept in &s;ubjec|tion. The&s;e people made their appearance in &s;mall parties. In a deep valley, near Za|ritzen, which &s;tands on a high bank of the Volga, was an encampment of Calmuck Tartars. They have the &s;ame turn of fea|tures with the Chine&s;e; but are fierce and &s;avage. Their arms are bows and arrows; and they feed on the fle&s;h of hor&s;es, camels, dromedaries, and almo&s;t whatever falls in their way. They throw their dead to the dogs;
<PB N="11" REF="035585_0010_10056C214EA69088">
and if &s;ix, or more, fea&s;t on the corp&s;e, they e&s;teem it honourable to the defunct. What a &s;ingular and barbarous idea!</P>
<P>They pay religious adoration to little wooden images, which they care&s;s when they are plea&s;ed, but beat and ill-treat when the weather is unfavourable, or fortune frowns on them.</P>
<P>Our traveller now &s;et about procuring a ve&s;&s;el to carry his goods to A&s;tracan, and found one, which he purcha&s;ed for forty roubles or ten pounds. This bark, in her materials and equipment, was one of the mo&s;t crazy and indifferent that was ever tru&s;ted with &s;uch a valuable cargo, particularly in &s;uch a dangerous navigation; but there was no alternative&mdash;a better was not to be pro|cured.</P>
<P>Having given the nece&s;&s;ary in&s;tructions with regard to the conveyance of the goods, he prepared for his own voyage down the Volga, by engaging, for him&s;elf and attend|ants, two boats, each navigated by five men, with the addition of &s;ix &s;oldiers, by way of protection. This precaution was requi&s;ite, as the Volga is frequently infe&s;ted with pi|rates, who make u&s;e of row-boats, that carry from twenty to thirty hands, and are provid|ed with firearms. The&s;e marauders appear chiefly in the &s;pring, when the river over|flows its banks, and facilitates their e&s;cape, &s;hould they meet with re&s;i&s;tance. They &s;el|dom fail to murder, as well as rob, tho&s;e whom they can overpower; but if taken,
<PB N="12" REF="035585_0011_10056C2369B4D588">
they meet with the mo&s;t exemplary puni&s;h|ment, which, cruel as it is, is not always &s;ufficient to deter the re&s;t of the gang.</P>
<P>The Ru&s;&s;ian &s;oldiers are encouraged to take them alive; when they are put on a float, wherein a gallows is erected, armed, with iron hooks; and the wretched pirates, being &s;u&s;pended on them by the ribs, with a label over their heads &s;ignifying their crime, are launched on the &s;tream, and writhe in agonies inexpre&s;&s;ible till death relea&s;es them. It is a capital offence to give them the lea&s;t relief, or even to di&s;patch them by a le&s;s painful death.</P>
<P>It is reported, that one of the&s;e mi&s;creants found means to di&s;engage him&s;elf from the hook, and, though naked and faint with the lo&s;s of blood, he got a&s;hore, when the fir&s;t object he &s;aw being a poor &s;hepherd, he knocked him on the head with a &s;tone, in or|der to obtain his clothes. Such is the la|mentable depravity of &s;ome natures, that no danger can intimidate them, no example, however dreadful, can reclaim them!</P>
<P>On the 14th of October, Mr. Hanway put off from &s;hore, and &s;ailing down the ri|ver, he &s;aw &s;everal water fowl, larger than &s;wans, which the Ru&s;&s;ians call Dika Baba, or the wild old woman. They live on fi&s;h; and their fat is e&s;teemed a &s;pecific in aches and brui&s;es.</P>
<P>During their progre&s;s, the weather proved calm and the current moderate. In many places the banks were high and undermined;
<PB N="13" REF="035585_0012_10056C24EC8A34D8">
in others they found a flat &s;hore of various extent.</P>
<P>On the 17th they &s;topped at Chernoyare, about half way from Zaritzen to A&s;tracan, from which it is di&s;tant two hundred ver&s;ts. This place has &s;ome fortifications, and car|ries on a con&s;iderable trade, with the &s;ur|rounding Tartar nations. Next night they had a providential e&s;cape from being lo&s;t; and what enhanced their gratitude for their deliverance, was the &s;ight of &s;everal wrecks ca&s;t on the &s;hore, near the &s;pot of their dan|ger.</P>
<P>On the 19th, he reached A&s;tracan, where he was obliged to wait for a ve&s;&s;el, com|manded by Captain Woodroofe, which was to convey him to Per&s;ia; and employed the interval in viewing this city and its envi|rons.</P>
<P>A&s;tracan is the metropolis of a province of the &s;ame name, and &s;tands in 47 deg. north latitude, within the limits of A&s;ia, in an i&s;land about &s;ixty Engli&s;h miles from the Ca&s;pian Sea. It contains about &s;eventy thou&s;and inhabitants, of various nations, who&s;e different manners and cu&s;toms exhibit an epitome of A&s;ia. It is &s;urrounded by an old brick wall, and is well garri&s;oned by &s;ix regiments of Ru&s;&s;ian troops. The hou&s;es are of wood, and mo&s;t of them very mean. The upper part of the town commands a view of the Volga, which is here near three miles broad, and, from its occa&s;ional inundations,
<PB N="14" REF="035585_0013_10056C2709268F50">
is &s;aid to render the air in&s;alubrious, and to bring on various di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>Many gardens and orchards &s;urround A&s;|tracan; and grapes are carried from thence, twice a week, to the court of Peter&s;burgh, though the di&s;tance is not le&s;s than one thou|&s;and two hundred Engli&s;h miles&punc; The me|lons are very good; but though the grapes are in &s;uch high reque&s;t, the wine of this country is very indifferent.</P>
<P>About ten miles below A&s;tracan is the &s;mall i&s;land of Bo&s;makoff, remarkable for its large &s;torehou&s;es of &s;alt, from whence an im|men&s;e extent of counrry is &s;upplied. In this place likewi&s;e are very capital fi&s;heries, par|ticularly of &s;turgeon, beluga, and a&s;&s;orta.</P>
<P>This country is much infe&s;ted with locu&s;ts, which &s;ometimes appear in &s;uch &s;warms that they darken the &s;ky, and wherever they alight, leave not a blade of vegitation. Cap|tain Woodroofe informed our author, that once &s;ailing down the Volga, a cloud of the&s;e in&s;ects had fallen into the river, and ob&s;truct|ed the motion of the boat for many fathoms together.</P>
<P>The trade of A&s;tracan con&s;i&s;ts in red lea|ther, linen and woollen cloths, the greate&s;t part of which is exported to Per&s;ia, from whence they receive &s;ilks, cottons, and drugs, particularly rhubarb. The la&s;t article is en|gro&s;&s;ed by the government, and private per|&s;ons are prohibited from dealing in it, on pain of death.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="035585_0014_10056C29C39B9580">While Mr Hanway was here, the go|vernor invited him to a fea&s;t at which were nearly three hundred di&s;hes, which gave him an opportunity of &s;eeing a &s;ingular &s;pecimen of Ru&s;&s;ian intemperance, in drinking goblets of cherry-brandy to exce&s;s. This fea&s;t was occa&s;ioned by the birth of the governor's grand-daughter; and each of the gue&s;ts, made a pre&s;ent to the mother, according to his rank and abilities. In the opinion of our author, this is an ingenious way of levying contributions on merchants and others; and though le&s;s delicate than &s;ome of our own u&s;ages, is at lea&s;t as hone&s;t and creditable.</P>
<P>For &s;everal miles round the city wherever the &s;oil will admit of cultivation, are &s;ettle|ments of the Crim Tartars, a very civil and indu&s;trious people, &s;ubject to Ru&s;&s;ia. They rai&s;e goods crops of manna, oats, and water|melons; but their chief riches con&s;i&s;t in their wives and children, their &s;heep, hor&s;es, and cattle.</P>
<P>When a daughter becomes marriageable, they cover her tent with white linen, tie a painted cloth on the top with red &s;trings, and place by the &s;ide a painted waggon, which is to be her dowery. This is a &s;ignal for tho&s;e who want a wife, and the girl is generally di&s;po&s;ed of to him who offers her father the mo&s;t valuable pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>On the 8th of November Mr Hanway left A&s;tracan under convoy of the governor's barge, with twelve grenadiers, and &s;lept the fir&s;t night near a Calmuck &s;ettlement, com|po&s;ed
<PB N="16" REF="035585_0015_10056C2BDAB5DC30">
of circular tents about twelve feet high and fifteen yards in circumference. In the centre of the tent they make a fire, and the &s;moke i&s;&s;ues out by a vent at top.</P>
<P>The&s;e people are mi&s;erably poor, and &s;ub|&s;i&s;t all the year round on fi&s;h, which they catch in the Volga. They prefer living on the banks of that &s;tream, where the flags and ru&s;hes grow to a great height, and a&s;&s;i&s;t to &s;helter them from the &s;everity of the win|ter's cold.</P>
<P>At the efflux of the Volga are numerous &s;mall i&s;lands, and the whole &s;cene appears wild and inho&s;pitable. Arriving at Terkie, Mr. Hanway embarked on board an Engli&s;h &s;hip, the Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia, plea&s;ed to ex|change his crazy bark for a ve&s;&s;el of good oak. It gave no le&s;s delight to &s;ee the Bri|ti&s;h flag, and to receive the attentions of his countrymen.</P>
<P>On the 3d of December, having anchor|ed in Langarood Bay, he &s;ent to Mr. Elton, a Briti&s;h factor, to inform him of his arrival, when that gentleman waited on him, and con|ducted him to the &s;hore, where he gave him a cordial reception.</P>
<P>Mr. Elton's habitation at Langarood, was eight Engli&s;h miles from the &s;ea, in the mid&s;t of woods, &s;urrounded by mar&s;hes, where the roads were almo&s;t impa&s;&s;able. This &s;itua|tion naturally made the place very unwhole|&s;ome</P>
<P>Here Mr. Hanway &s;pent &s;everal days in conver&s;ing about the Ca&s;pian trade. It ap|peared
<PB N="17" REF="035585_0016_10056C2D5BC19F10">
that Mr. Elton was actually engaged in building &s;hips for the &s;hah, as had been reported in Ru&s;&s;ia; and Mr. Hanway took occa&s;ion to point out his apprehen&s;ions of the danger that might ari&s;e to their trade and &s;ettlement in Ru&s;&s;ia, in con&s;equence of his engagements with that prince.</P>
<P>One great inducement to open the Ca&s;pian trade, was the hope of e&s;tabli&s;hing a new branch of commerce from A&s;trabad to Me&s;|ched, from whence Mr. Elton thought it practicable to extend it to the northern ci|ties of the Mogul's empire. To attempt the execution of this de&s;ign fell to Mr. Hanway's lot. He had brought with him goods to the value of five thou&s;and pounds, for which he found no market in this country; and though the &s;hah had made an expre&s;s de|cree for his &s;afe conduct in all parts of his dominions, he was under con&s;iderable appre|hen&s;ions, till he found that, in ca&s;e of dan|ger, he might obtain a guard of &s;oldiers.</P>
<P>Having taken leave of Mr. Elton, our traveller got on &s;hip board, and they directed their cour&s;e for A&s;trabad, where they arrived on the 18th of December The &s;ea here, as in other parts of the Ca&s;pian, makes great inroads on the land, &s;o that in many places, trees lie on the &s;hore.</P>
<P>The &s;hip having ca&s;t anchor, Mr Hanway &s;ent an Armenian &s;ervant to know if he might land his goods in &s;ecurity; but he &s;oon re|turned without any information. In&s;tantly

they &s;aw many fires lighted, the &s;ignal of alarm; for, it &s;eems, the natives took them for pirates, and had put them&s;elves on the defen&s;ive.</P>
<P>Two days after, Mr. Hanway went on &s;hore, and having &s;atisfied the natives that he was come on a friendly errand, they received him kindly, and conducted him and his at|tendants to a &s;mall village, the way to which lay through thick woods and winding paths.</P>
<P>Having di&s;patched his Armenian interpre|ter to Mahomet Zaman Beg, the governor of A&s;trabad, with his compliments, that chief returned him an a&s;&s;urance of his pro|tection, and cautioned him again&s;t putting any confidence in the natives on the coa&s;t. A few days after he received a vi&s;it from Na|zeer Aga, a Per&s;ian officer attended by a grave old man named Myrza, who had a high reputation for wi&s;dom. The former had been recommended to Mr. Hanway as a per|&s;on of great probity; and on this occa&s;ion he made him offer of his hou&s;e at A&s;trabad, which our author accepted with grateful thanks.</P>
<P>About this time the ve&s;&s;el narrowly e&s;cap|ed being burnt, from the accidental confla|gration of a quantity of raw cotton, which was with difficulty extingui&s;hed with little damage, after it had nearly reached the pow|der che&s;t. Same night their alarm was re|newed by the mountains appearing in a blaze, which fire was intentionally kindled to de|&s;troy the in&s;ects; but, &s;preading by the wind
<PB N="19" REF="035585_0018_10056C323038E110">
and the long-continued drought, it made &s;uch progre&s;s, that the butter in the &s;hip was melt|ed by its heat, and the natives were obliged to labour with all their might to divert its cour&s;e from their villages.</P>
<P>On the 2d of January 1744, Mr. Hanway pitched his tent on the &s;hore, and made pre|paration for conveying the goods to the city. That day they were entertained with extem|pore &s;ongs, dances, and congratulations by the natives; and in the evening they witne&s;|&s;ed their devotions. Next morning Myrza's brother and two &s;ons brought hor&s;es for Mr. Hanway, and in a few hours they reached the city.</P>
<P>The &s;ucceeding day our author waited on the governor, and made him a pre&s;ent of &s;e|veral cuts of broad cloth and &s;ugar-loaves. He was attended by &s;everal per&s;ons of di&s;|tinction in the city, and behaved with great conde&s;cen&s;ion, telling Mr. Hanway that he was welcome to Per&s;ia, and that the city of A&s;trabad was now at his di&s;po&s;al. For this high-&s;trained compliment, our traveller re|turned due acknowledgments, and expre&s;&s;ed the grateful &s;en&s;e he felt of his kindne&s;s and protection.</P>
<P>Mr. Hanway, who was about to become the dupe of his own integrity and want of &s;u&s;picion, now waited on Nazeer Aga, of who&s;e politene&s;s he had received &s;ome &s;ignal proofs. He was far advanced in years; but while his age and his white beard rendered his appearance venerable, his manly cheerful

manner made his company perfectly agreea|ble. This per&s;on had been the companion of Nadir, when he was no more than the chief of a party of robbers in the neighbour|ing mountains; but &s;eemed too hone&s;t and una&s;&s;uming for a favourite; yet tho&s;e quali|ties had, perhaps, been his &s;afeguard through life. The old man received Mr Hanway with many tokens of good will, and &s;ent for &s;ome ma&s;ter carriers to agree about convey|ing his caravan to Me&s;ched. Here our traveller fir&s;t received an impre&s;&s;ion of the equivocating di&s;po&s;ition of the Per&s;ians; he found it impo&s;&s;ible to fix them to any thing, and therefore took his leave for that time.</P>
<P>A day or two after, &s;everal of the princi|pal per&s;ons of the place came to pay their re&s;pects to Mr. Hanway. Mo&s;t of them had an air of importance, and &s;poke little; but af|ter &s;itting and &s;moking the caallean, a mode of u&s;ing tobacco through water, for a few minutes, they ro&s;e and took their leave.</P>
<P>The difficulties and delays made by the carriers gave him great vexation, and &s;ome of the town&s;men frequently importuned him to open his bales there, and &s;ell them what they wanted. To this propo&s;al he did not think it prudent to accede; but to keep them in good humour, he made the mo&s;t con&s;idera|ble per&s;ons pre&s;ents of cloth enough to make a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">at.</P>
<P>At length, on the per&s;ua&s;ion of Nageer Aga, though contrary to his own &s;entiments, he &s;uffered the carriers to &s;et out with ten
<PB N="21" REF="035585_0020_10056C35D607A9E8">
loaded camels, two or three days before he was to follow them with the hor&s;es, and ap|pointed a place of rendezvous, on the other &s;ide of the mountains.</P>
<P>The&s;e being di&s;patched, Mr. Hanway made a vi&s;it to the governor, who appeared agitated and confounded. He pretended to be employed in providing hor&s;es to convey part of the king's trea&s;ure to Ca&s;bin, which prevented him from accommodating our traveller with &s;oldiers and hor&s;es as he wi&s;hed. This intelligence extremely &s;tartled him, but fortunately for his peace, he was at this time ignorant of the real extent of his un|happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Determined to follow the caravan imme|diately, he prepared to &s;et out; but while he was giving the nece&s;&s;ary orders, Nazeer Aga told him this was not a lucky hour, and that he mu&s;t not depart. Our author ex|pre&s;&s;ed his reliance on a good Providence who ordered all events, and that all hours were the &s;ame to him. However, the cata&s;trophe was now ripe. Scarcely had Nazeer Aga left him, when the hoar&s;e &s;ound of trumpets was heard to call in the neighbouring in|habitants, the &s;hops were ordered to be &s;hut, and the town&s;men to man the walls.</P>
<P>Mr. Hanway now began to recollect ma|ny incidents which a&s;&s;i&s;ted to develope the plot. Nazeer Aga advi&s;ed him to &s;end or his &s;hip, as they were all in extreme danger from a rebellion which had broken out in the vicinity of the city; but the ve&s;&s;el had &s;ailed
<PB N="22" REF="035585_0021_10056C37F3E4D9E0">
to another port; and he found that no one was allowed to leave the city; &s;o that the loads of cloth he had &s;ent forward were de|voted to the in&s;urgents without oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>It now appeared that Mahomet Ha&s;&s;an Beg, who had left the city &s;ome days before, had put him&s;elf at the head of a party Kha|jars and Turcoman Tartars, with an avowed intention of &s;eizing the &s;hah's trea&s;ure, and particularly our traveller's caravan.</P>
<P>The only con&s;olation that Nazeer Aga could now give Mr. Hanway, was the a&s;|&s;urance, that while he lived, he &s;hould be &s;ecured from per&s;onal danger. The re&s;pect which had always been &s;hewn by the chief of the in&s;urgents to this old man, induced him to venture him&s;elf among them; but he u&s;ed his eloquence and influence in vain to recal them to their duty, though they &s;uffered him to return to the city.</P>
<P>A be&s;ieged city, with a faithle&s;s and weak garri&s;on, was a new &s;cene to Mr. Hanway; and the idea he had formed of the barbarity of the Turcoman Tartars increa&s;ed the gloom in&s;eparable from his &s;ituation. His attend|ants would have per&s;uaded him to a&s;&s;ume the Per&s;ian dre&s;s, but he cho&s;e to remain with|out di&s;gui&s;e. The governor, however, and Nazeer Aga e&s;caped by night in the habit of pea&s;ants, and left the town&s;men to take c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e of them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who had not engaged in the rebel|lion now cur&s;ed our traveller as the cau&s;e of their di&s;tre&s;s, alledging that it was his valua|ble
<PB N="23" REF="035585_0022_10056C3A35EBC5A0">
goods that had tempted the in&s;urrection.</P>
<P>But he could not reproach him&s;elf with having given any ju&s;t cau&s;e of offence to any one; and patiently waited the event. The town was &s;urrendered on the 17th, and the king's trea&s;ure being &s;eized, the general and his attentendants next vi&s;ited Mr. Hanway, who, having collected his men into one room, &s;ent a Tartar boy, who &s;poke the Turki&s;h language, to introduce tho&s;e ho&s;tile gue&s;ts, and to tell them that he entreated humani|ty.</P>
<P>They a&s;&s;ured him of per&s;onal &s;ecurity, and that as &s;oon as the government was &s;ettled, his goods &s;hould be paid for; demanding at the &s;ame time to know where they were lodged, and a&s;king for his pur&s;e, which they returned, after counting the money.</P>
<P>It was now apparent on what principles Myrza Mahomet had acted. He was in the &s;ecret of the rebellion at the time he invited Mr Hanway to the city, and had brought him there as a victim, devoted to ruin; but having nothing more than his life to lo&s;e, he de&s;&s;embled the perfidy he had experienced, and endeavoured to &s;ecure the protection of Baba Sadoc, the new governor of the city, to whom he made a pre&s;ent of a piece of rich &s;ilk that he had found means to &s;e|crete.</P>
<P>His purfe, however, was again demanded, and he was obliged to give it up. Indeed he found that the Turcomans were not &s;ati&s;|fied with his &s;poils; they propo&s;ed to Ma|homet
<PB N="24" REF="035585_0023_10056C3CF215D2B8">
Khan Beg to have him and his at|tendants given up as &s;laves; and fearing le&s;t he &s;hould be carried away by tho&s;e barbarians, into their own country, he re&s;olved to effect his e&s;cape.</P>
<P>The victors &s;oon quarrelled about the plunder, and an order was i&s;&s;ued that no one &s;hould pa&s;s the gates without the knowledge of Mahomet Ha&s;&s;en Beg. However, Mr. Hanway having given the governor a regular account of the real value of the goods, the better to carry on the farce, was pre&s;ented with a bill for the amount, payable as &s;oon as the new order of affairs was &s;ettled. The governor al&s;o directed that a guard and hor&s;es &s;hould be provided for him and his attend|ants.</P>
<P>Accordingly, on the 24th of January, they took their leave of the city or A&s;trabad, ac|companied by Myrza his brothers, and two &s;ons. At the end of the fir&s;t day's journey, one of Myrza's brothers offered to conduct Mr. Hanway to a hou&s;e belonging to him in the adjacent mountain, which &s;cheme he re&s;o|lutely declined; and in this he was confirm|ed by the carriers, who expre&s;&s;ed their ap|prehen&s;ions for his &s;afety, if he complied.</P>
<P>It &s;eems this villian &s;uppo&s;ed our traveller was &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;ome concealed proper|ty, and having got him in his power, was de|termined to make u&s;e of the opportunity which pre&s;ented it&s;elf of &s;tripping <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of every thing. Finding he could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gle him by fal&s;e pretences, he &s;crupled not to

declare, that he would not &s;uffer him to proceed a mile farther, unle&s;s he left his bag|gage, as he could not an&s;wer for his &s;afety.</P>
<P>This crafty veteran, who&s;e perfidiou&s;ne&s;s was exceeded by nothing but his hypocri&s;y, was playing a deep game. If the rebellion &s;ucceeded, he intended to make &s;ure of the baggage; if it failed, be wi&s;hed to have the merit of pleading his loyalty, by pre&s;erving it for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. Mr. Hanway &s;aw him&s;elf wholly at his mercy, and therefore, after having concealed every thing that was port|able, he delivered up the re&s;t to him.</P>
<P>Next day, our author advanced with his Company about twenty Engli&s;h miles, and took up his lodgings in the open fields. Finding that his conductors &s;owed rebellion wherever they came, as the government of the &s;hah was become very unpopular, from his tyranny and exactions, he determined to part with them as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. They had engaged to carry him to Balfru&s;h, the capital of Mazandera; but hearing that the admiral of the coa&s;t, Mahomet Khan, was rai&s;ing forces to check the progre&s;s of the revolters, they were intimidated from pro|ceeding to the place of their de&s;tination, and left him on the &s;ea coa&s;t, before he knew how to manage without their &s;ervices.</P>
<P>After a very perilous navigation, he pro|videntially got &s;afe to Me&s;chedizar, and &s;oon after waited on the admiral of the coa&s;t, who congratulated him on his e&s;cape
<PB N="26" REF="035585_0025_10056C40AD504010">
with life, and joined in the a&s;&s;urances which he had received from the merchants at Bal|fru&s;h, that the &s;hah would make him a com|pen&s;ation for his lo&s;&s;es. This &s;erved to re|vive his dejected &s;pirits; but next day, the rebels having advanced within a few miles of the city, and the admiral painting the dan|gers of his own &s;ituation, as he neither was in a condition to give battle, nor dared to retreat for fear of his ma&s;ter's di&s;plea&s;ure, Mr. Hanway &s;aw there was no time to be lo&s;t, and e&s;caped by one gate as the Tar|tars entered by another.</P>
<P>The di&s;tre&s;&s;es he now underwent would be painful to relate. Hunger, cold, fatigue, and the mo&s;t imminent danger &s;urrounded him; but after various adventures, he had the good fortune to arrive at Langarood, which he had left &s;even weeks before; and was received by Mr. Elton with open arms, who rejoiced at his having e&s;caped with li|berty and life.</P>
<P>Mr Hanway had been twenty three days in reaching this place, from the time he left A&s;trabad; and for &s;ixteen days he had not taken off his boots, nor enjoyed a moment's comfortable repo&s;e. His legs and feet were much &s;welled and brui&s;ed; and he was in want of every nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Being now in &s;afety him&s;elf, his cares re|turned for his attendants, whom he had been obliged to abandon to their fate. Mr. Elton immediately &s;ent &s;ervants and hor&s;es in que&s;t of them, and if the di&s;a&s;ters which befel

Mr. Hanway him&s;elf were great, the calam|ities which Mr. Hogg, his clerk, had been doomed to &s;uffer, infinitely &s;urpa&s;&s;ed them. This unfortunate man was almo&s;t expiring of a con&s;umption, when he was brought to Langarood; he had been expo&s;ed, for three days and as many nights, to the cold and rain, without food or &s;helter; he had been five times robbed, and at la&s;t &s;tripped of his clothes, and left almo&s;t naked; and would infallibly have peri&s;hed, had he not been re|lieved by the charity of &s;ome dervi&s;es, who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> retreat in the mountains he had the good fortune to di&s;cover.</P>
<P>One of the Armenian &s;ervants, named Matteu&s;e, and his companions, did not re|turn till three weeks after, and had the good fortune to e&s;cape many of tho&s;e hard&s;hip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; Sadoc Aga had given them a pa&s;&s;port, the dictation of which will give a pretty good idea of the idiom of the oriental languages, as well as of Per&s;ian arrogance. "To the victorious armies be it known, that Matt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|u&s;e, the Armenian is here. Let him not be mole&s;ted, but live under our &s;hadow."</P>
<P>Being recovered from his fatigues, Mr. Hanway &s;et out for Re&s;hd, and after tra|velling &s;even miles, arrived at Lahijan, which is &s;eated on an eminence, and is reckoned the mo&s;t healthy town in the province of Ghilan. The rains had filled a large flat with water, in the centre of which &s;tood <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> grove on a moderate elevation, which &s;erve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

to beautify the pro&s;pect, and to render it as delightful as the &s;ea&s;on would permit.</P>
<P>Here he was received by Hadjee Zamon,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hadjee, or Sacred, is a title given to all tho&s;e who have made a pilgrimage to Mecca</NOTE> a man of &s;en&s;e and authority, who loudly complained of the inhumanity of the &s;hah and his officers. Supper being brought in, a &s;ervant pre&s;ented a ba&s;on of water and a towel to the gue&s;ts, to wa&s;h and dry their hands with; and then a kind of tea-board was &s;et before each, covered with a plate of pleo, in which was a &s;mall quantity of mine|ed meat mixed up with fruits and &s;pices. Plates of comfits, &s;herbet, and other weak liquors, were al&s;o &s;erved up. Every viand in this country is &s;o prepared, that it may be eaten with the fingers; to cut dre&s;&s;ed meat is reckoned an abomination.</P>
<P>Supper being fini&s;hed, warm water was brought in to wa&s;h with, and then the con|ver&s;ation was re&s;umed. This was carried on with great decency and attention to the &s;en|timents of the aged. It is not the riche&s;t man who is here regarded, but he who is mo&s;t e&s;teemed for wi&s;dom and experience.</P>
<P>Next morning our traveller &s;et forward to Re&s;hd, well plea&s;ed with his la&s;t night's en|tertainment; and the following day arrived at that city, where he had the plea&s;ure to be vi&s;ited by two Engli&s;h gentlemen, and three French mi&s;&s;ionaries. Soon after, he paid a vi&s;it of ceremony to Ordo Kouli Beg, gover|nor
<PB N="29" REF="035585_0028_10056C471E69F708">
of the province, who received him with much politene&s;s, and ordered a chair to be &s;et for him; a mark of attention not often paid in this country, where European fa&s;hi|ons are little regarded. The apartment was full of people, &s;eated on felts of camel's hair. After &s;ome general conver&s;ation, Mr. Hanway related the hi&s;tory of his misfor|tunes, and &s;oon took his leave.</P>
<P>Having here provided him&s;elf with clothes, arms, mules, and hor&s;es, he pur&s;u|ed his journey on the 26th. In the vicinity of Re&s;hd, are rice fields and plantations of mulberry-trees. The mountains, however, are compo&s;ed of naked rocks, piled on each other to a great height, and the only fertili|ty is in the vales.</P>
<P>On the 28th they pa&s;&s;ed the river Kizi|lazan in canoes, and &s;wam over the hor&s;es and mules; but the rapidity of the &s;tream rendered this very dangerous. As they a&s;|cended the mountains, they found the cli|mate much altered; and the wind blowing fre&s;h, they were obliged to di&s;mount and lead their cattle along the narrow paths among the precipices. The rocks here almo&s;t ro&s;e perpendicular from the river.</P>
<P>Continuing their progre&s;s over the moun|tains, on the 1&s;t of March they came to the great plain of Ca&s;bin, then covered deep in &s;now, which reflected &s;uch brightne&s;s from its &s;urface as painfully affected the organs of &s;ight. The villages in this plain are built in &s;uch a manner, that half the tenement is un|der

the &s;urface of the earth, and the roof is rai&s;ed into a cone, the better to carry off the &s;now. That night they lodged in a ru|ined &s;table; and next day re&s;umed their journey before &s;un ri&s;ing.</P>
<P>When Mr. Hanway arrived at Ca&s;t in, he waited on Hadjee Abdulcrim, the principal merchant in the town, who provided him with a hand&s;ome lodging, and told him that it was impo&s;&s;ible to proceed farther at pre|&s;ent, on an account of the &s;now.</P>
<P>The hou&s;es of Ca&s;bin are almo&s;t wholly &s;ubterraneous, and many of the gardens are below the level of the adjacent lands, to fa|cilitate the conveyance of water to them. In general they build with unburnt brick, and u&s;e a &s;trong cement of lime. Their habita|tions are flat roofed, and con&s;i&s;t of two di|vi&s;ions within an inclo&s;ure of mud. In the exterior court is a &s;pacious room called the Aviam, open on one &s;ide, and &s;upported by pillars, where the men di&s;patch their bu&s;i|ne&s;s; and behind this is the haram, or wo|men's apartment. Niches in the walls &s;up|ply the place of tables. The floors are co|vered with large carpets, and large pieces of felt are u&s;ed by way of cu&s;hions.</P>
<P>Mr. Hanway was hand&s;omely entertained by the Hadjee on the 3d of March. His ho&s;t enquiring how he liked Per&s;ia, our tra|veller told him the di&s;a&s;ters he had met with; when he received the comfortable a&s;&s;urance, that the &s;hah would do him ju&s;tice; but gave a pathetic de&s;cription of the mi&s;ery to which
<PB N="31" REF="035585_0030_10056C4C04B8E0A8">
the country was reduced; and in&s;tanced Ca&s;|bin, which was reduced from twelve thou|&s;and hou&s;es to le&s;s than a tenth of that num|ber. Mr. Hanway &s;en&s;ibly remarked, that when the &s;overeign had accompli&s;hed his de|&s;igns, there was rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, he would alter his &s;y&s;tem; for that it never could be his purpo&s;e to de&s;troy his people, as that would be annihilating his own con&s;equence.</P>
<P>In Ca&s;bin is a palace built by Nadar Shah, which Mr. Hanway vi&s;ited. It has a long avenue of lofty trees before the en|trance, and is inclo&s;ed by a wall of about a mile and a half in circumference, with only one entrance. Within this area are four large &s;quares, adorned with trees, fountains, and running &s;treams. The apartments are rai&s;ed about &s;ix feet from the ground; and the aviam, or open hall, which &s;tands in the centre, &s;huts in with folding doors. The rooms are ornamented in the Italian ta&s;te, and the ceilings are embelli&s;hed with moral &s;entences, arranged in &s;quares. Mo&s;t of the windows are compo&s;ed of painted gla&s;s, in which the figures are drawn in proper &s;hades, and executed with great felicity of de&s;ign.</P>
<P>The haram makes a magnificent appear|ance, and is quite &s;eparated from the other parts of the palace, by a wall of its own. The rooms are &s;inely decorated, and the whole is refre&s;hed with fountains, and adorn|ed with elegant and expen&s;ive embelli&s;h|ments.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="035585_0031_10056C4E211EAB10">Near the haram is the eunuchs' apart|ment, remarkable only for its having but one door. Here are likewi&s;e &s;ome old a|partments built by Shah Abas, in which are &s;ome indifferent pictures, by European arti&s;ts.</P>
<P>The city of Ca&s;bin is fortified by a wall and turrets. It is famous in hi&s;tory for hav|ing been one of the chief cities of the anci|ent Parthia, the re&s;idence of many of the Per&s;ian kings, and the burial place of He|phoe&s;ton, the favourite of Alexander the Great.

<P>In Per&s;ia it is an e&s;tabli&s;hed cu&s;tom for the military to pillage wherever they go, or at lea&s;t to compel the natives to furni&s;h them with whatever they want. This hard treat|ment &s;teels the hearts of the pea&s;ants again&s;t the calls of humanity. They defend their property by barricadoing their hou&s;es, and con&s;ider every &s;tranger as a foe, by which means the innocent &s;uffer, as well as the guilty.</P>
<P>Mr. Hanway at length di&s;covered that all his Per&s;ian fellow-travellers were in the cu&s;|tody
<PB N="33" REF="035585_0032_10056C4FA2F64588">
of a me&s;&s;enger. One of them who was a native of the ea&s;tern parts of Per&s;ia, particularly attracted his notice. He was al|mo&s;t black; and apprehended him&s;elf to be in con&s;iderable danger from the re&s;entment of the Shah. Being of a communicative di&s;po&s;ition, and finding that our author was an European, he freely &s;poke his &s;entiments.</P>
<P>"I am come from I&s;pahan," &s;aid he, "where I have been two years engaged in rai&s;ing forces for the &s;hah; and, in return for my &s;ervices, he has lately extorted four thou&s;and crowns from me, and I am now under the dread of &s;ome other act of vio|lence. It is no unu&s;ual thing for my ma&s;|ter to &s;end for a man, in order to &s;trangle him; and, for my part, I &s;hould be glad to compound for a &s;evere beating."</P>
<P>This pri&s;oner endeavoured to learn a pray|er by heart, which, if he repeated right in the pre&s;ence of the &s;hah, he &s;aid, it would divert his wrath. He had al&s;o another &s;pell, which was the repetition of ten particular letters of the alphabet as he entered the royal tent, clo&s;ing a finger at each, and keep|ing his fi&s;t clenched till he came before the throne; when he was &s;uddenly to open his hands, and by the di&s;charge of his magic ar|tillery, to &s;ubdue his &s;overeign's re&s;entment.</P>
<P>It is a&s;toni&s;hing to &s;ee in how many in|&s;tances the Per&s;ians demon&s;trate the highe&s;t &s;uper&s;tition. Almo&s;t every motion of the

<P>On the 17th, they began to approach the camp, and already fell in with the advanced guard. As they drew near the place where they expected to find their doom, the fears of the Per&s;ian convoy increa&s;ed, and they took leave of our author with heavy hearts. Their conductor, on wi&s;hing them to get on quickly, was a&s;ked, why he ha&s;tened them; "for, do&s;t thou not know," &s;aid one of them, "that to condemned per&s;ons, every hour of life is precious?"</P>
<P>Mr. Hanway having &s;ent forward his in|terpreter to the &s;hah<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s mini&s;ter, appointed for the reception of &s;trangers, to receive in|&s;tructions; on the 20th pitched his tent near the royal &s;tandard, and had the &s;atisfaction
<PB N="35" REF="035585_0034_10056C5483816660">
of hearing that the rebellion of A&s;trabad was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. But be had not been long in this &s;ituation, before a loaded piece, ac|cidentally going off in his tent, had very near deprived him of life; nor was he free from apprehen&s;ion of being called to account for the danger in which this involuntary bu|&s;ine&s;s had involved others, particularly as it happened &s;o near the royal re&s;idence. How|ever, it pa&s;&s;ed with no very &s;erious con&s;e|quences to any one.</P>
<P>Having paid his re&s;pects to Mu&s;tapha Khan, he was received with many marks of civility, invited to dinner, and made com|fortable, by the a&s;&s;urance that ju&s;tice &s;hould be done him. Meanwhile he delivered his petition into the chancery; and had the plea&s;ure to hear that it was believed, his ma|je&s;ty would pardon the Per&s;ians who had accompanied him from Ca&s;bin, as a com|pliment to him.</P>
<P>In a few days, the royal &s;tandard was tak|en down, as a &s;ignal for &s;triking the t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nts, and the whole army moved with great regu|larity, and again encamped about two leagues and a half di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Soon after our traveller received a decree, by which it was ordered, that he &s;hould de|liver in the particulars of his lo&s;&s;es in wri|ting, to Behbud Khan, the general in A&s;|trabad, who had orders to re&s;tore whatever part of the goods might be found, and to pay the deficiency, out of the &s;eque&s;tered e&s;tates of the rebels, to the la&s;t farthing.
<PB N="36" REF="035585_0035_10056C56A64D9E48">
As this laid him under the nece&s;&s;ity of re|turning to A&s;trabad, it was not quite what he wi&s;hed for, but he thought it prudent to acquie&s;ce.</P>
<P>Mr. Hanway being now made ea&s;y on the &s;ubject of his lo&s;s, amu&s;ed him&s;elf with tak|ing a ride round the Per&s;ian camp. The tents of the mini&s;ters and officers were pitch|ed in front, near that of the &s;hah, and oc|cupied a con&s;iderable &s;pace. The pavillion, in which his maje&s;ty u&s;ually &s;at to give au|dience, was of an oblong form, &s;upported by three poles, adorned at the top with gilt balls. It had no appearance of appropri|ate magnificence, and the front was always open, even in the mo&s;t unfavourable wea|ther The roof was covered with cotton cloth, lined with clouded &s;ilk. On the floor were &s;pread carpets, on which the &s;hah &s;ome|times &s;at cro&s;s-legged, and &s;ometimes he in|dulged him&s;elf with a &s;ofa.</P>
<P>At a di&s;tance behind were the monarch's private tents, where he retired to his meals; and almo&s;t contiguous were the tents of his ladies, &s;eparated from each other by curtains. The boundaries of the &s;hah's quarter were occupied by his eunuchs and female &s;laves; and almo&s;t the whole inclo&s;ure was &s;urround|ed by a &s;trong fence of net-work, guarded by a nightly patrole, that exerci&s;ed &s;everity again&s;t all intruders.</P>
<P>The camp market was about half a mile in extent. It con&s;i&s;ted of tents ranged like the hou&s;es in a &s;treet, where all kinds of
<PB N="37" REF="035585_0036_10056C5829999CC8">
provi&s;ions and articles of convenience were &s;old. An officer &s;uperintends this di&s;trict of the camp, and rides up and down, to pre|&s;erve peace and order. All the dealers are under the protection of &s;ome of the cour|tiers, who are them&s;elves the principal &s;pe|culators in grain, by which they make va&s;t profits.</P>
<P>The &s;hah had about &s;ixty women, and a|bout the &s;ame number of eunuchs. When he changed his &s;tation, he was preceded by running footmen, chanters, and a watch guard, that &s;pread a mile or two, to give notice of their ma&s;ter's approach, and to warn the people from intruding. Howe|ver, when he travelled without his women, this precaution was not attended to, and his &s;ubjects were allowed to approach him. His women, and other ladies of di&s;tinction, rode a&s;tride on white hor&s;es, or were carried on camels in a kind of elegant panniers. Wo|men of inferior rank mixed among the crowd; but not without a linen veil over their faces particularly tho&s;e of Per&s;ian birth, who are very &s;crupulous in this re&s;pect. A|bout one female to ten males is the u&s;ual proportion in the &s;hah's camp.</P>
<P>The hor&s;e furniture belonging to Nadir was to the la&s;t degree expen&s;ive. He had four &s;ets of it, one mounted with pearls, another with rubies, a third with emeralds, and a fourth with diamonds of great magni|tude. The immen&s;e value of tho&s;e trap|pings could only be equalled by the barba|rous
<PB N="38" REF="035585_0037_10056C5A4729C168">
ta&s;te in which they were executed. In a vi&s;it to Mu&s;tapha Khan, our traveller of|fered to get a complete &s;et of hor&s;e furni|ture made up in Europe for the &s;hah, which would infinitely &s;urpa&s;s the workman&s;hip of &s;uch as he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; but the khan, perfectly knowing his ma&s;ter's temper, replied, "the &s;hah has not patience enough to wait till they are fini&s;hed."</P>
<P>The officers, and even the &s;oldiers, &s;eem to have a pride in the &s;plendor of their hor&s;es' trappings; and, indeed, their accou|trements and arms in general, are very rich. It &s;eems to be a principle of policy in the monarch, to keep his army dependent, by encouraging them to expend their money in articles of vanity.</P>
<P>Mu&s;tapha Khan, one of the be&s;t and great|e&s;t men in the Per&s;ian court, &s;hewed &s;o much attention to Mr Hanway, that, out of gra|titude, he pre&s;ented him with a gold repeat|ing watch, &s;ome fine cloth, and &s;ilk. The chief at fir&s;t declined accepting them; but at la&s;t, being prevailed on to honour our traveller &s;o far, he made a return in &s;ome jewels, which had once decorated the head|dre&s;s of an Indian. The principal jewel con&s;i&s;ted of a large &s;apphire &s;et in gold, and encompa&s;&s;ed with diamonds</P>
<P>On the 27th of March, Mr. Hanway left the Per&s;ian camp, and had two &s;oldiers a&s;|&s;igned for his protection They now took a different route; and had every where the melancholy pro&s;pect of va&s;t tracts of land,
<PB N="39" REF="035585_0038_10056C5D018AF560">
of the riche&s;t &s;oil, lying wa&s;te, and towns and villages, once populous and hand&s;ome, reduced to ruin and de&s;olation</P>
<P>Next day, in the vicinity of an inacce&s;&s;i|ble mountain, they di&s;covered five per&s;ons, who put them&s;elves into a threatening po&s;ture, which gave our author &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s. The &s;oldiers entered into a parley with one of them, and purcha&s;ed a &s;tolen hor&s;e, belong|ing to the party of marauders, who, it &s;eems, were intimidated from attacking Mr. Han|way, by the reputation which the Europe|ans po&s;&s;e&s;s for their dexterity in the u&s;e of fire-arms. From this adventure, our author had no very exalted opinion of the reliance he could place on his military guards.</P>
<P>On the 29th, they a&s;cended the &s;ummit of a very high mountain, where they found the air &s;o extremely &s;ubtle and piercing, that it was with difficulty they could breathe. De&s;cending, however, into the valley, they enjoyed a very different climate, and Abar appeared before them with an enchanting a&s;pect. But this city had &s;uffered like the re&s;t, and it was with difficulty they could procure a lodging in it.</P>
<P>The mountains, over which their direct road lay, being &s;till covered with &s;now, they were obliged to take a circuit us route, and in the &s;pace of four leagues, they had occa|&s;ion to cro&s;s a branch of the Kizilazan no le&s;s than &s;ixty-five times This river was about thirty feet wide, and between two and
<PB N="40" REF="035585_0039_10056C5E83454BA8">
three deep: the &s;tream was rapid, and the bottom &s;toney and rough.</P>
<P>After a journey of ten hours, they arriv|ed at a de&s;olate caravan&s;ary, where they found nothing but water; but &s;ome ho&s;pita|ble inhabitants of a village they had previ|ou&s;ly pa&s;&s;ed through, had &s;upplied them with provi&s;ions. Next day, on approaching the mountains that cover Ghilan, they found the reflection of the &s;un &s;o &s;trong, that it was with difficulty they &s;aved them&s;elves from the &s;corching heat. At length, being almo&s;t exhau&s;ted, they came in &s;ight of the village of Ar&s;evil, which being barricadoed with large fir trees, except one narrow pa&s;&s;age, excited a &s;u&s;picion that it was in a &s;tate of rebellion. This apprehen&s;ion, however, was &s;oon relieved, by their learning that the in|habitants had thus &s;ecured them&s;elves from the couriers of the &s;hah, who &s;eize their hor&s;es, and ride them without mercy. They gave our traveller and his attendants a kind reception; but in two hours after their arri|val, eight couriers arrived, well-armed, em|ployed on &s;ome mi&s;&s;ion for their &s;overeign. The&s;e couriers exerci&s;e many acts of wanton cruelty, and think the authority under which they act is &s;ufficient to protect them. The po&s;tma&s;ters, who &s;upply them with hor&s;es, are &s;ubject to grievous oppre&s;&s;ions, and have frequently demands made upon them beyond what they can an&s;wer. One of the&s;e contractors being charged by Nadir with di&s;appointing his couriers, made this bold
<PB N="41" REF="035585_0040_10056C60A10E6700">
reply: "For every ten hor&s;es in my power, you &s;end me twenty couriers; and a man had better die at once than live to &s;erve a ra&s;cal." With this he immediately &s;tabbed him&s;elf. The &s;hah exclaimed, "Save him! he is a brave fellow!" but humanity was now too late: the wound was mortal.</P>
<P>While in this village, Mr. Hanway had the pain to &s;ee &s;ome youths, inve&s;ted with military power, &s;triking old men, who&s;e a&s;|pect entitled them to reverence, for trivial o|mi&s;&s;ions, or for no fault whatever. His Ar|menian &s;ervants &s;eemed inclined to imitate their example; but he re&s;trained them, by the a&s;&s;urance, that they &s;hould &s;uffer tenfold puni&s;hment if they injured any one.</P>
<P>After cro&s;&s;ing a high mountain, they de&s;|cended into a plea&s;ant and fruitful valley. Spring had already &s;trewed the ground with her fine&s;t bloom; and the brightne&s;s of the &s;ky, together with the picture&s;que appear|ance of the country, filled the mind with the mo&s;t plea&s;ing ideas. The river Kizila|zan meandered through this delicious &s;pot, and the mo&s;t beautiful woods and lawns di|ver&s;ified the &s;cene.</P>
<P>How happy, &s;ays Mr. Hanway, might Per&s;ia be, did not a general depravity of manners involve her inhabitants in &s;uch in|extricable confu&s;ion! But how much hap|pier &s;till are tho&s;e countries, though under a le&s;s favourable &s;ky, which enjoy a mild go|vernment, and who&s;e inhabitants are in&s;pired

with &s;entiments of true religion and virtue, which alone can blunt the edge of tho&s;e ills to which mankind are univer&s;ally &s;ubject!</P>
<P>On the 1&s;t of April, Mr. Hanway pa&s;&s;ed the defiles of the mountains, which guard the province of Ghilan, and next day arriv|ed at Re&s;hd, where he had the plea&s;ure of meeting &s;ome of his friends. On the 5th, he reached Langarood, where he once more found him&s;elf happy in the &s;ociety of Mr. Elton and the French mi&s;&s;ionaries.</P>
<P>Though near the &s;cene of his former &s;uf|ferings, and obliged to have intercour&s;e with &s;ome of tho&s;e who had contributed to his di&s;a&s;ters, with a mind &s;uperior to revenge, he indulged that Chri&s;tian charity which a|lone can en&s;ure tranquillity, and render the mind happy when it turns on it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Mr. Hanway was here vi&s;ited by a Per&s;ian prie&s;t, in company with Shahverdie Beg. They entertained him with &s;everal quotati|ons from their p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ets, particularly in regard to love and women; and expre&s;&s;ed them|&s;elves on this &s;ubject with great delicacy. The prie&s;t, or mullah, ob&s;erved, that though their laws allowed of four wives, be&s;ides con|cubines, he con&s;idered that man as the mo&s;t virtuous, who confined him&s;elf to one; while, on the other hand, he regarded celi|bacy as a crime again&s;t nature</P>

Even legi|timate marriage does not &s;eem to entitle the women to any di&s;tingui&s;hed privileges; for they are con&s;idered as little more than crea|tures formed for the plea&s;ure of their lords.</P>
<P>The women of Ghilan are fair and hand|&s;ome. They have black eyes and hair; and they darken the former by art. They are generally low in &s;tature, and have delicate features. The children of both &s;exes have fine complexions; but the boys &s;oon con|tract a tawney hue.</P>
<P>The women here are very indu&s;trious, and are frequently employed in the toils of agri|culture, on which occa&s;ions they do not al|ways conceal their faces with a veil. When women of rank, however, go abroad, they are not only veiled, but have a &s;ervant to clear the way for them; and it is reckoned the greate&s;t mark of unpolitene&s;s to look at them.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">How &s;ingular do the cu&s;toms of &s;ome countries appear, when contra&s;ted with tho&s;e of others!

Yet vanity is character|i&s;tic of the &s;ex in every country.</NOTE></P>
<P>The Per&s;ians are much governed by &s;hew and external parade. Hence &s;ome of the European factors have carried their o&s;tenta|tion to the mo&s;t ridiculous pitch. Perhaps this conduct is politic among a people who
<PB N="44" REF="035585_0043_10056C678567D9A0">
are &s;wayed by appearance; but it &s;eems in &s;ome ca&s;es to be carried too far.</P>
<P>The province of Ghilan is partly &s;ur|rounded by mountains, and has many diffi|cult pa&s;&s;es, for which rea&s;on it is not ea&s;ily kept in &s;ubjection. Re&s;hd, the capital, was formerly reckoned a mo&s;t in&s;alubrious &s;itua|tion, from the thickne&s;s of the woods which &s;urrounded it; but &s;ome of the&s;e have been cleared, and the place is no longer &s;o fatal to life. The whole province however is mar&s;ay; and it is ob&s;erved by the natives, that only women, mules, and poultry enjoy health, which may po&s;&s;ibly ari&s;e from the confine|ment to which they are generally &s;ubject.</P>
<P>But though the climate is unpropitions, the &s;oil is rich, and produces exuberant crops. Fruits of all kinds are very plenti|ful; but the grapes, for want of cultivation, are but indifferent Indeed, mo&s;t of the fruits are unfavourable to the health of &s;tran|gers, particularly the peaches and figs, which partake of the pernicious moi&s;ture of the &s;oil.</P>
<P>Having taken care to provide him&s;elf a proper armed guard, on the 1&s;t of May, Mr. Hanway &s;et out for A&s;trabad The fir&s;t evening they were benighted and lo&s;t in a wood, though they had &s;ucce&s;&s;ively pro|cured &s;everal guides, who abandoned them through fear. In this dilemma they ad|vanced towards a light, where they found a hou&s;e barricadoed with trees. In vain did they u&s;e their entre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ties with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">

conduct them to Radiz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r: they were oblig|ed to break into his hou&s;e by force, and to carry him with them in a rope. Unwarrant|able as this conduct may appear, it is con&s;o|nant to the practice in this di&s;tracted coun|try; and they took care to reward him for his &s;ervices, though they were involuntary.</P>
<P>Next day they entered the province of Mazanderan. On the 4th their cattle were attacked by a large wolf; but being driven off by the guard, the &s;avage content|ed him&s;elf with killing a cow. Soon after they fell in with a detachment of fifty &s;oldi|ers, the commander of whom courteou&s;ly of|fered his &s;ervice to guard them. Ten men were accepted, and the officer was compli|mented with cloth for a coat.</P>
<P>As they advanced farther into this pro|vince, which greatly re&s;embles Ghilan in its &s;oil, climate, and productions, the pea&s;ants began to grow daring, and one of them &s;eized the commander of their troop by the throat As it is dangerous to proceed to extremities, Mr. Hanway recommended for|bearance, and even withdrew from the hou&s;e a&s;&s;igned for their lodgings to a tent in the open air, that he might not incommode the women and children belonging to the fami|ly. Such attentive humanity is very amiable in any per&s;on, and probably was little ex|pected among the people of this country. However, night drawing on, he found him|&s;elf in a very bad neighbourhood; for the&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">lagers having engaged in the late rebelli|on,
<PB N="46" REF="035585_0045_10056C6B27B7FBE8">
began to be apprehen&s;ive that the &s;tran|gers were &s;ent to &s;eize them, and took to their arms, but &s;oon retired. The inhabitants of the neighbouring mountains were equally di&s;affected, and &s;everal hor&s;emen poured down into the village in the night, no doubt, with a view of plundering them; but find|ing Mr. Hanway and his party prepared, they returned without attempting any thing. It was evident they were con&s;idered as ex|tremely rich; for the natives would not be per&s;uaded, but that all the bra&s;s buttons on their clothes were &s;olid gold.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as it was day, they left this un|plea&s;ant &s;ituation, under a hot &s;un, which the Per&s;ians &s;eemed little to regard. During the heat of the day, however, they took &s;hel|ter in a wood, re&s;olving in future to travel only in the cool. As they approached to|wards Amul, the country appeared &s;till more plea&s;ant. The city &s;tands at the foot of Mount Taurus, and is wa&s;hed by a fine river, over which there is a bridge of twelve arches.</P>
<P>The Per&s;ians have a tradition, that if any governor or commander pa&s;&s;es this bridge on hor&s;eback, he will &s;oon be deprived of his office, if not of his life. On this account, though the &s;tream is very rapid, the natives generally ford it; and as our author did not chu&s;e to be regarded as a per&s;on excluded from the common bounties of heaven, he thought proper to gratify opinion &s;o far as to alight, and lead his hor&s;e over this fated bridge.</P>

<P>In this city our traveller met with a wri|ter belonging to Mahomet Khan, who, af|ter detailing the particulars of the late rebel|lion, invited him to a concert of mu&s;ic. One in&s;trument re&s;embled a flute, another a gui|tar, and a third a kettle-drum; to the mu|&s;ic of which an old man and two boys &s;ang and danced.

<P>To entertain Mr. Hanway to the be&s;t of his power, the writer then &s;ent for a prie&s;t, celebrated for his voice; but neither the vo|cal nor in&s;trumental mu&s;ic had much ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ms for an European ear.</P>
<P>In the evening of the 9th, Mr. Hanway left Amul, and travelled through a delight|ful country till they reached Balfru&s;h, the capital, where he learned additional circum|&s;tances relative to the fate of the rebels. Among the re&s;t, he was told, that the go|vernor appointed by Sadoc Aga, being &s;eiz|ed, had holes cut in his fle&s;h, and lighted candles put into them, in which &s;hocking

condition the unhappy chief was led <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aked about the market place, till he expired with lo&s;s of blood.</P>
<P>A day or two after Mr. Hanway paid a vi&s;it to Mahomet Khan, who had a delightful re&s;idence a few miles from the city. It was far from being &s;uperb; but the adjacent woods and rivulets gave it an air of charm|ing &s;implicity, beyond the fine&s;t &s;trokes of art. In the area before the hou&s;e, one hundred and fifty men were drawn up under arms, in double lines, to receive the gue&s;t. Our author alighted from his hor&s;e at a &s;mall di&s;tance, and advanced towards the khan with the u&s;ual &s;alutation. He was &s;itting in the aviam, or outer court, and re|ceived him with many expre&s;&s;ions of kind|ne&s;s; and, as a proof of his regard relea&s;ed a man that was tied and condemned to be beaten; adding, that he did this purely to honour his vi&s;itor.</P>
<P>Our traveller made this chief a pre&s;ent of &s;ome fine cloths, and a ca&s;e of choice li|quors, of which he was immoderately fond. Having prevailed on his gue&s;t to tarry all right, he ordered poultry and a &s;heep to be killed. Re&s;olving to &s;hew him &s;uch attenti|on as would wipe off the &s;tain of his former oil treatment; for which he conde&s;cended to make an apology.</P>
<P>After dinner, mu&s;ic and dancers were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ent for, who tortured the nerves of our au|thor the whole evening with their noi&s;e and ge&s;ticulation. When the dancing men fini&s;h|ed,
<PB N="49" REF="035585_0048_10056C7179277840">
they pre&s;ented Mr Hanway with an orange, which was a civil intimation that they expected a recompence for their trou|ble.</P>
<P>This entertainment being over, the khan invited him to drink brandy with him, and expre&s;&s;ed his a&s;toni&s;hment, when he found that an European and a Chri&s;tian was not fond of &s;pirituous liquors The khan, and his friends, indeed, &s;hewed no reluctance in this re&s;pect; and after Mr. Hanway retired, it is probable they fini&s;hed the &s;trong waters he had pre&s;ented him with. The u&s;ual mode is for each per&s;on to have a plate of &s;weet|meats before him, and to drink their liquor out of tea-cups, till they drop with intoxi|cation.</P>
<P>Next morning, Mr. Hanway viewed the monument of the khan's favourite wife, who had lately been buried in an adjoining wood. It had an epitaph, in which the trite &s;enti|ment was repeated, of comparing life to a flower, that blo&s;&s;oms in the &s;pring, attains the full lu&s;tre of beauty in the &s;ummer, be|gins to wither and decline in autumn, and when winter comes on, is liable to be blown to the ground by every gu&s;t of wind, where it lies and rots</P>
<P>Mr. Hanway now left Balfru&s;h, and pro|ceeded on his journey through a fine country to Alleabad, which has a palace of mean ap|pearance, but delightfully &s;ituated. The mo&s;t capital work of art in this vicinity is
<PB N="50" REF="035585_0049_10056C73444BF1F0">
the cau&s;eway, built by Shah Abas the Great, which extends from Ke&s;kar, in the &s;outh-we&s;t corner of the Ca&s;pian, to A&s;trabad, and be|yond it; compri&s;ing, in the whole, an ex|tent of three hundred Engli&s;h miles. It is rai&s;ed to the middle, with ditches on each &s;ide, and, in &s;ome places it is bordered with a thick wood, who&s;e luxuriant branches af|ford a delightful &s;helter to travellers.</P>
<P>At Sari, the next &s;tage, are four temples of the Guebres, or wor&s;hippers of fire, who formerly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all this coa&s;t. The&s;e re|ligious edifices are rotundas about fifty feet in diameter, rai&s;ed to a point of near one hundred and twenty feet in height, and are formed of the mo&s;t durable materials.</P>
<P>Continuing their route to A&s;hreff, they had a view of the mountain Demoan, on which, the Per&s;ians &s;ay, the ark re&s;ted, while the Armenians a&s;cribe this honour to Mount Arrarat, which in clear weather is al&s;o vi&s;ible on the we&s;tern coa&s;t of the Ca&s;|pian.</P>
<P>At A&s;hreff, they &s;aw a celebrated palace of Shah Abas, the mo&s;t magnificent of any on the coa&s;t of the Ca&s;pian Sea. Over the entrance are the arms of Per&s;ia, a lion with the &s;un ri&s;ing behind him, emblematic of the &s;trength and glory of this empire. Within the gate is a long avenue, on each &s;ide of which are thirty apartments for guards. The next gate opens into a garden, through which runs a &s;tream of limpid water, that falls in
<PB N="51" REF="035585_0050_10056C76A0B9BF20">
&s;everal ca&s;cades, with a ba&s;on and fountain at each.</P>
<P>In an adjacent building is a princely avi|am, painted with gold flowers on a blue ground, and containing &s;everal portraits, by a Dutch arti&s;t, of no ma&s;terly execution. On the &s;ides of the aviam are &s;everal &s;mall apart|ments, and behind them other waterfalls that pour down the &s;ides of a &s;leep mountain clothed with wood.</P>
<P>The garden is chiefly laid out in walks, bordered with rows of pines, orange, and other fruit trees. Beyond this is another garden, which &s;eems to be con&s;idered as &s;a|cred ground, as they were not permitted to enter it.</P>
<P>They next vi&s;ited a banquetting hou&s;e, dedicated to a grand&s;on of Ali; and out of re&s;pect to this place, they were de&s;ired to leave their &s;words at the door. The &s;o|lemnity with which our author was intro|duced here, in&s;pired at fir&s;t a kind of awe; but it was &s;oon exchanged to contempt, on &s;eeing the room adorned with &s;uch paintings as could only plea&s;e a voluptuous Mahome|tan.</P>
<P>They were then &s;hewn another hou&s;e and garden, in which was a &s;tately dome who&s;e top was painted, and the was covered with Dutch tiles, as far as the gallery. On an eminence, at &s;ome di&s;tance, &s;tood a building intended for an ob&s;ervatory.</P>
<P>The whole &s;tructure commands the view of a fine country and of the Ca&s;pian Sea.
<PB N="52" REF="035585_0051_10056C78C19FEC90">
In &s;hort, every circum&s;tance con&s;pires to ren|der this place delightful, and filled our au|thor with many plea&s;ing ideas; but the wretchedne&s;s of the people con&s;tantly recur|red to his thoughts, and damped the plea|&s;ure he felt from a view of the country.</P>
<P>On the 15th, they left A&s;hreff, and on the way met a courier from Myrza Maho|met to be&s;eech Mr. Hanway to ha&s;ten his journey, and u&s;e his intere&s;t to &s;ave his life. As they approached the city of A&s;trabad, they met &s;everal armed hor&s;emen, carrying home the pea&s;ants, who&s;e eyes had been put out for taking a part in the late rebellion. Near the entrance of the city on each &s;ide, was a &s;tone pyramid, full of niches which were filled with human heads that made a mo&s;t gha&s;tly appearance.</P>
<P>On entering A&s;trabad for the &s;econd time, Mr Hanway found it a &s;cene of mi&s;ery and de&s;olation That day the eyes of thirty per&s;ons had been &s;cooped out, four had been beheaded, and one burnt alive; two hun|dred women had been bani&s;hed the city, one hundred and fifty of whom had been &s;old to the &s;oldiers as &s;laves.</P>
<P>When Mr. Hanway was introduced to Behbud, the king's general, he found him &s;urrounded by &s;oldiers, and employed in judging and condemning the unhappy in|&s;urgents. After the fir&s;t compliments, our author delivered the &s;hah's decree, which was received with every mark of re&s;pect, and given to the &s;ecretary to read. A &s;peedy
<PB N="53" REF="035585_0052_10056C7A43293FF8">
compliance with it was promi&s;ed, and Mr. Hanway was then entertained with &s;weet|meats, and large white mulberries, which are a delicious fruit. During this repa&s;t, the pri&s;oners were removed, and the &s;ecreta|ry made a complimental &s;peech on the utili|ty of merchants, who ought, for their &s;er|vices to kings and countries, to be protected by all parties, and injured by none.</P>
<P>Sadoc Aga, who had a principal hand in Mr Hanway's misfortunes, was then brought before the tribunal. When our au|thor &s;aw him before, he was a youth of more than common vivacity, was richly dre&s;&s;ed, well armed, and full of mirth. What a change now appeared! His garb was mean, his eyes were deprived of &s;ight, he drooped his head, even the tone of his voice was altered. The general told him he mu&s;t pay for our traveller's goods, and en|quired how they had been di&s;po&s;ed of. "All I know of them," &s;aid he, "is, that they were taken by Mahomet Ha&s;&s;an, and by him di&s;tributed to the people. Would to God! that Mahomet Ha&s;&s;an, and his whole hou&s;e had been buried deep in the earth, ere I had heard his name! And how can I refund? I have nothing left, but this mean garb you &s;ee on my back; and this, indeed, is more than &s;ufficient; for, after you have deprived me of fight, of what value is life to me?"</P>
<P>This feeling &s;peech was accompanied with that emotion, natural to a daring &s;pirit: it
<PB N="54" REF="035585_0053_10056C7C5E25FCB0">
ought to have melted the tyrant; but to &s;i|lence him, he cruelly ordered the mi&s;erable man to be &s;truck on the mouth, which was done with &s;uch violence, that the blood gu&s;h|ed out.</P>
<P>Sadoc Aga being removed, Myrza Ma|homet was brought in, loaded with wooden fetters, and a heavy triangular wooden col|lar about his neck. Mr. Hanway might then have retorted the wrongs he had receiv|ed, had he been a brute; but he was a man, and a Briton, and wounded with the pite|ous objects before his eyes, his heart was too full to bear the &s;ight any longer.</P>
<P>He then vi&s;ited Mahomet Hu&s;&s;ein Khan, who&s;e &s;on had been governor of A&s;tracan before the rebellion, and who had been charged with the murder of Shah Toehmas, the la&s;t legitimate &s;overeign of Per&s;ia. He a&s;&s;ured Mr Hanway that his bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hould be expedited according to the &s;hah's order, and ob&s;erved, "I am charged with a parti|cular commi&s;&s;ion to excecute puni&s;hment on the rebels. I mu&s;t do that for which I know I &s;hall be damned. To-morrow is a day of blood; I will make them pay you, though I pull the money out of their throats."</P>
<P>This was too much for humanity to hear: Mr. Hanway was incapable of thanking him for this bloody intention. The unhappy re|bels had acted, indeed, as if they meane to devote them&s;elves to ruin; yet an oppo&s;iti|on to &s;uch execrable tyranny wanted only
<PB N="55" REF="035585_0054_10056C7DE203F648">
more &s;trength and wi&s;dom to give it the &s;tamp of glory.</P>
<P>Next day, eight Turcoman Tartars be|ing taken, were brought into the city, on which the general expre&s;&s;ed great &s;atisfacti|on, ob&s;erving, that many niches in the py|ramid called by his own name, were yet un|filled. In Per&s;ia a malefactor is executed with little ceremony; he kneels, and pro|nouncing his creed, "There is but one God, Mahomet is his prophet, and Ali his friend," his head is &s;truck off with a &s;cime|ter</P>
<P>When Mr. Hanway waited on Nazeer Aga, who had been his firme&s;t friend, he expre&s;&s;ed great &s;atisfaction at &s;eeing him a|live, after the dangers they had both run through. This per&s;on had been well remu|nerated by the &s;hah for the &s;ervices he had rendered him during the rebellion</P>
<P>In a few days after Mr. Hanway was in|formed that Captain Woodroofe was arrived in the bay of A&s;trabad, and Nazeer Aga ad|vi&s;ed him, by letter, that, as &s;everal of the hordes were &s;till in arms, it might be dan|gerous for him to tru&s;t his property on board the &s;hip. Our author thanked him for his care; but affecting &s;ecurity, as the be&s;t means of preventing danger; he returned for an&s;wer, that the great guns would deli|ver them from the mo&s;t numerous a&s;&s;ailants that might have the temerity to attack the ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="035585_0055_10056C80A5C52C98">On the 21&s;t, Myrza Mahomet delivered to Mr. Hanway the greate&s;t part of his bag|gage, and al&s;o paid him as much money as, he &s;aid, was in his hands, or in his power; in hopes that our author would intercede in his favour. Next morning he waited on the khans, and told them that Myrza had re|&s;tored his baggage, and that he hoped he would be pardoned "For your &s;ake," &s;aid the khan, "he &s;hall be &s;aved. His ma|je&s;ty has &s;hewn you honour, and it is my bu&s;ine&s;s to do the &s;ame." Mr. Hanway made his acknowledgments, and Myrza was liberated.</P>
<P>Mr. Hanway had now received to the va|lue of about five thou&s;and crowns; and was reque&s;ted to take a part of the remainder in female &s;laves. This he po&s;itively refu&s;ed to do, perhaps to the a&s;toni&s;hment of the ge|neral, who, learning, he was only thirty-two years old, &s;eemed to be looking for a &s;olu|tion of his continence in his hoary locks, till he was told that he wore a wig.</P>
<P>Delays &s;till intervening about the pay|ment of the remainder of the money, the governor pre&s;&s;ed Mr. Hanway to take his obligation for it, payable in ten or fifteen days, as the general was obliged to march, and avowed that he could not depart with|out a receipt; and that he mu&s;t kill men till he completed the &s;um. Mr Hanway ex|pre&s;&s;ed his hope that no one would &s;uffer on his account; but that he could not an&s;wer
<PB N="57" REF="035585_0056_10056C83557D2110">
to his principals to give a receipt in exchange for any obligation whatever.</P>
<P>Some days after, our author privately con|veyed on board the &s;hip, money and goods to the value of eleven thou&s;and crowns, and on the 29th he vi&s;ited the &s;hip again with five thou&s;and crowns more; leaving Matte|u&s;e, his old Armenian clerk, and two &s;er|vants to &s;olicit for the remainder, that was due, in conformity to the &s;hah's decree.</P>
<P>Before Mr. Hanway takes his leave of Per&s;ia, he give &s;ome account of the religi|on of the Guebres, which is &s;till pre&s;erved by &s;ome of the po&s;terity of the ancient Indi|ans and Per&s;ians. This religion &s;prang from Zeroa&s;ter, who lived about the year of the world 2860. This great philo&s;opher, &s;truck with the demon&s;trations he ob&s;erved of the perfection of that &s;elf-exi&s;tent Being, who is the author of all good, taught his follow|ers to wor&s;hip God under the &s;ymbol of light or fire, con&s;idering the brightne&s;s, activity, purity, and incorruptibility of that element, as bearing the mo&s;t perfect re&s;emblance to the nature of the beneficent Being Thus the Per&s;ians honoured the &s;un as the brighte&s;t image of God, and offered up their &s;acri|fices in the open air, thinking it injurious to the maje&s;ty of the God of Heaven, who fills immentity with his pre&s;ence, to confine his &s;ervice within walls.</P>
<P>About &s;ix hundred years after the fir&s;t Zeroa&s;ter, another philo&s;opher, of the &s;ame
<PB N="58" REF="035585_0057_10056C84D6B917C8">
name, aro&s;e, who refined on the doctrines of his predece&s;&s;or, and cau&s;ed temples to be built, in which the &s;acred fire was ordered to be continually pre&s;erved. The Guebres, or Gaurs, &s;till adhere to the tenets of tho&s;e two philo&s;ophers, with a few modifications, and their veneration for fire is unabated.</P>
<P>What is commonly called the everla&s;ting fire, is a phenomenon of a very extraordina|ry nature. This object of devotion is to be &s;een about ten miles from Bakir, a city of the Ca&s;pian Sea, where are &s;everal ancient temples of &s;tone, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been all dedicated to this active and pure element. Among the re&s;t is one, in which the Indi|ans now perform their devotions. Near the altar is a hollow cane, from the end of which i&s;&s;ues a blue flame, like that of a lamp burn|ing with &s;pirits. This flame, the wor&s;hip|pers pretend, has continued ever &s;ince the general deluge, and they believe it will la&s;t till the con&s;ummation of all things.</P>
<P>Round this temple are generally forty or fifty poor devotees, who come on a pilgrim|age from their own country, and are charged with the expiation of the fine of their friends and neighbours, which, it &s;eems, can be done by proxy. They mark their forehe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ds with &s;affron, and the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed for piety among them, ob&s;erve certain painful and invariable po&s;tures of their limbs.</P>
<P>At a &s;mall di&s;tance from the temples is a low cleft of a rock, with a horizontal open|ing, near &s;ix feet long and three broad, from
<PB N="59" REF="035585_0058_10056C86F0C6E488">
which i&s;&s;ues a blue flame, like that from the reed or cane in the temple. In &s;erene weather it burns low, but during a high wind, it &s;ometimes mounts to eight feet; yet without apparent effect on the rocks or &s;urrounding objects Here the devotees al&s;o pay their adorations</P>
<P>What is &s;till more &s;ingular, for two miles round this place, on removing the &s;urface of the ground to the depth of two or three in|ches, the uncovered part immediately takes fire on applying a coal or torch to it; but though it warms the earth, it does not change its &s;ub&s;tance. If a cane, or even a paper tube, be fixed, about two inches deep in the earth, and a live coal be held over the top and blown on, a flame in&s;tantly i&s;|&s;ues, without burning either the cane or the paper, provided their edges be luted. Three or four of tho&s;e burning canes will boil a pot, and in this manner the people dre&s;s their victuals.</P>
<P>Though this flame burns &s;o &s;pontaneou&s;|ly, it may be as ea&s;ily extingui&s;hed as that of &s;pirits of wine Round this remarkable &s;pot, brim&s;tone is dug, and &s;prings of naptha are found. The &s;prings boil up highe&s;t when the weather is thick and hazy; and the naptha often kindling on its &s;urface, &s;preads with incredible rapidity to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance. In &s;hort, the everla&s;ting fire is really natural to the &s;oil, and may be tra|ced to brim&s;tone and naptha. The latter, indeed, is the only fuel the inhabitants u&s;e
<PB N="60" REF="035585_0059_10056C890E45A408">
for dome&s;tic u&s;e, and is generally kept in earthen ve&s;&s;els under ground, and at a di&s;|tance from their hou&s;es, becau&s;e it is apt to kindle of it&s;elf.</P>
<P>In the penin&s;ula of Apcheron is a kind of white naptha, of a thinner con&s;i&s;tence, which the Ru&s;&s;ians u&s;e medicinally, and it is &s;aid to be carried into India, where, be|ing prepared, it forms the mo&s;t beautiful and durable varni&s;h known.</P>
<P>But to re&s;ume the narrative of tran&s;acti|ons: Mr. Hanway, having lived &s;ome time in a very friendly manner with Mr. Elton at Langarood, finding his health declining, removed to Lahijan for change of air, and from thence to Re&s;hd. About this time Mr Elton, who had hitherto &s;hewn him the extreme&s;t kindne&s;s, being much offended with our author's employers for their &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion to the Ru&s;&s;ian court, and apprehen|&s;ive that he might be blamed for his engage|ments with the &s;hah, which were ab&s;olutely incon&s;i&s;tent with the views of the Ru&s;&s;ian company, &s;uddenly contracted an unrea&s;on|able enmity again&s;t our traveller. But the details of quarrels can never be plea&s;ing to the benevolent, and therefore we pa&s;s over them</P>
<P>Mr Hanway having, with extreme dif|ficulty, and after long delay, obtained a recompence for his lo&s;&s;es, he di&s;po&s;ed of the cloth he had recovered, in Re&s;hd; and laid out the produce, as well as the money that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, in raw &s;ilk.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="035585_0060_10056C8B2663FCD8">Thus having fini&s;hed his mercantile tran&s;|actions, he left the city of Re&s;hd on the 13th of September, and arriving at Perry|bazar, he embarked in a flat-bottomed Per|&s;ian boat, and on the 29th reached Yerkie, where the commander of a guard-&s;hip, &s;ta|tioned there informed him, that if he had any goods on board, which were not the produce of Ghilan, and did not declare them, the law made it capital to the offend|er, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d decreed that the &s;hip and cargo &s;hould be burnt.</P>
<P>The Ru&s;&s;ian con&s;ul, it &s;eems, had inform|ed the governor of A&s;tracan, that the plague was raging at Ca&s;han; and, in con&s;equence of this, Mr. Hanway was &s;trictly interro|gated, if he had any goods on board from that place. They were then ordered to land on a &s;mall de&s;olate i&s;land to the ea&s;t of the channel of the Volga, where a &s;ur|geon examined them with the u&s;ual precau|tions; and, after being &s;atisfied they were not under infection, their letters were dip|ped in vinegar, and delivered to him.</P>
<P>Renewed enquiries were made, as to the places from whence they had taken their car|go, and where they had per&s;onally been &s;ince they left Ru&s;&s;ia.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate matters remained, till the 11th of October, during which &s;pace they &s;uffered both from the weather and the want of fre&s;h provi&s;ions. At la&s;t, a &s;ignal was made by the guard-&s;hip for Mr. Hanway and the captain to come on board, when
<PB N="62" REF="035585_0061_10056C8D46B9BDA0">
they had the mortification to be enjoined the performance of quarantine on an unin|habited i&s;land, &s;till more to the ea&s;tward. But what affected them mo&s;t, was to learn that all their letters, di&s;patches, and pa&s;&s;|ports, with the lives of twelve &s;oldiers, were lo&s;t by the attacks of the Calmucks, on the party which carried them.</P>
<P>At length, the governor of A&s;tracan &s;ig|nified his permi&s;&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n for Mr. Hanway to come up as far as the i&s;land of Caraza, &s;i|tuated on a &s;mall branch of the Volga, on condition that he brought neither clothes nor baggage with him. At this place he was lodged in a hou&s;e detached from the crew and the other pa&s;&s;engers, and, before he was &s;uffered to proceed further, he was required to &s;trip him&s;elf entirely naked in the open air, and to pa&s;s through the unplea&s;ant ce|remony of having a pail of warm water thrown over him.</P>
<P>Having undergone this di&s;cipline, he em|barked in a large barge rowed by twelve grenadiers, and &s;ailed for A&s;tracan. The day after his arrival, he waited on the go|vernor, who&s;e behaviour appeared much changed &s;ince he vi&s;ited him before.

<P><PB N="66" REF="035585_0065_10056C9547BC8F70">Mr. Hanway arrived at Peter&s;burgh on the 1&s;t of January, after having been ab|&s;ent about a year and four months, in which &s;pace he had travelled above four thou&s;and miles by land.</P>
<P>Peter&s;burgh, it is univer&s;ally known, was founded by Peter I. in the beginning of the pre&s;ent century, and may now be con&s;ider|ed as the modern metropolis. Though the &s;oil was formerly a barren mora&s;s, the geni|us of the founder has converted it into &s;olid land, and rai&s;ed an elegant and &s;uperb city on a &s;pot the mo&s;t unpromi&s;ing. This place ranges on both &s;ides of the N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">va. At the upper end of the north &s;ide &s;tands the citadel, which is more remarkable for the number of lives &s;acrificed in building it, than for its &s;trength.</P>
<P>As Peter took Am&s;terdam for his model, this city is inter&s;ected by canals; but, &s;in|gular as it may appear in &s;uch a climate, the hou&s;es are chiefly built in the Italian ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">, and have more numerous windows than the buildings in England.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By the heavy duties which have been laid on windows in this country, modern architecture is de|formed; for few now can afford to &s;tudy the beau|ty of appearance, but only the &s;aving of expence.</NOTE></P>
<P>The climate in the Ru&s;&s;ian dominions is very various. In the month of February, at Peter&s;burgh, the &s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> generally &s;hines bright, the &s;ky is clear, and every object &s;eems to glitter with gems, while the hu|man

frame is braced by the cold. Riding on &s;ledges then con&s;titutes the principal amu&s;e|ment of the young and active.</P>
<P>March commonly brings &s;howers, which, with the increa&s;ing heat of the &s;un, begin to melt the &s;urface of the ice, which in the Neva is &s;ometimes three quarters of a yard thick. About the end of that month, it frequently breaks up, and navigation begins to be re&s;tored.</P>
<P>April is often warm, and &s;erves as the prelude to the &s;pring: but it is &s;ometimes the beginning of June before vegetation has made any con&s;iderable progre&s;s. The heat at that &s;ea&s;on becoming very inten&s;e, its ef|fects on nature may be vi&s;ibly traced from day to day.</P>
<P>From this time, till the middle of July, the &s;un is almo&s;t con&s;tantly above the hori|zon, except for about two hours every night. The heat, at this period, is even di&s;agreea|bly inten&s;e; and would be &s;till more unplea|&s;ant did not winds and &s;howers occa&s;ionally refre&s;h the air Mr. Hanway, who re&s;ided here five years, once experienced a delightful &s;ea&s;on till the end of September; but this rarely happens: Augu&s;t clo&s;es the &s;cene of rural beauty and vegetation; &s;o that three months alone in the year, nature appears ani|mated.</P>
<P>In October and November the Neva is always frozen, and when once the ice be|comes &s;olid and the &s;now hard, the period of &s;peedy and &s;ecure conveyance by &s;ledges

<P>The Ru&s;&s;ians are generally of a middle &s;tature, though many of them are tall and comely. The women, however, are le&s;s lovely in Ru&s;&s;ia than in many other coun|tries, and even what charms they naturally po&s;&s;e&s;s are ob&s;cured by paint. It is an avow|ed &s;entiment with them; that if they have &s;ufficient plumpne&s;s, they can procure them|&s;elves beauty.</P>
<P>The common people are dre&s;&s;ed in long coats made of &s;heep &s;kins, with the wool inwards, and they wear fur caps&punc; Howe|ver, per&s;ons of rank, dre&s;s nearly in the &s;ame manner as the Engli&s;h, except wear|ing a great coat lined with fur, with a fur cap, whenever they go abroad.</P>
<P>Except the difference of petticoats, the lower cla&s;s of women wear &s;heep &s;kin coats, like the men; but tho&s;e who move in a higher &s;phere have &s;ilk cloaks lined with furs, which are rich or ordinary, according to rank and fortune.</P>
<P>Having clo&s;ed his commercial engage|ments at Peter&s;burgh, on the 9th of July 1750, Mr. Hanway left this place, and pro|ceeding along the banks of the Neva, came to the palace of Strelna Mu&s;a, about twenty

The gardens are laid out in a fine ta&s;te, and the whole edifice was intended to have been on a magnificent &s;cale, had Peter lived to realize his ideas. However, Peterkoff, which that great mo|narch left a mean building, by the partiali|ty of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, has ri&s;en into grandeur; while Strelna Mu&s;a has been neglected In|deed, Peterkoff has many local advantages. It has fine water works, &s;aid to re&s;emble tho&s;e of Ver&s;ailles, and the land&s;capes it commands are highly picture&s;que.</P>
<P>Mr. Hanway pa&s;&s;ing the Gulph of Fin|land, arrived at Cron&s;tadt, where unfavoura|ble weather confined him here &s;everal days. This delay gave him an opportunity of exa|mining the dry dock, contrived by Peter the Great, which is one of the mo&s;t &s;tupen|dous works of the kind in the world It ex|tends above &s;even hundred &s;athoms, is &s;ixty feet wide at the bottom, eighty at the top, and forty deep, furni&s;hed with different flood gates. Fourteen line of battle &s;hips may be accommodated here at once. Adjoining is a capital re&s;ervoir.</P>
<P>The I&s;land of Cron&s;tadt is about eighteen miles in circumference, but very barren. The great re&s;ort of mariners, however, to the town, renders it a populous and flouri&s;h|ing place.</P>

<P>Great part of Revel &s;tands upon an emi|nence, and has regular fortifications. The &s;treets are neither wide nor uniform, but &s;ome of the edifices are &s;tately, particularly the public buildings, though they contain little remarkable.</P>
<P>On the 19th, Mr. Hanway re embarked, and pa&s;&s;ing the I&s;le of Gothland, belonging to Sweden, on the morning of the 24th they entered the Vi&s;tula, and &s;ailed up to Dant|zic.

<P>Among the curio&s;ities which chiefly at|tracted our author's attention, was the great Lutheran church, a very ancient &s;tructure, which &s;till retains the crucifixes and other emblems of popery. This, it &s;eems, is not merely a matter of indifference, but was &s;ti|pulated by treaty. Among the paintings is one on wood by Van Dyke, repre&s;enting the re&s;urrection. It is much admired for its expre&s;&s;ion, though it is &s;aid to be one of the fir&s;t performances in oil colours.</P>
<P>Corn is the principal article of traffic here, which in plentiful &s;ea&s;ons, is brought down the Vi&s;tula in amazing quantities. The ve&s;|&s;els employed in this trade are about fifty

<P>Our traveller having &s;pent a week very agreeably at Dantzic, and provided him&s;elf with a chariot, took leave of his friends. He &s;oon entered the Pru&s;&s;ian dominions, and at Stolpe, a &s;mall plea&s;ant city, he was exa|mined whence he came, and whither he was going This is u&s;ual in Pru&s;&s;ia, and gives a good idea of vigilance and military di&s;ci|pline.</P>
<P>He now travelled over an open plea&s;ant country of arable lands, pretty populous, but not rich. At Stargard, the metropolis of Pru&s;&s;ian Pomerania, is a cathedral church of great antiquity; and three reformed church|es, in one of which &s;ervice is performed in the French language.</P>
<P>Our author next arrived at Koenin&s;burg, a &s;mall town on the Oder, which river he cro&s;&s;ed by a timber bridge. On the north bank is a fine palace and garden, belonging to the Margrave of Schwedt, with a very neat town, bearing the &s;ame name, adjacent. Near this place he &s;aw the bodies of two malefactors, who had been broken on the wheel.

<P>As he approached to Berlin, the face of the country began to wear a more cultivated a&s;pect; but the want of inclo&s;ures is a defect in rural embelli&s;hment; nor is that vivid verdure to be &s;een here which captivates the eye in England.</P>
<P>From Dantzic to Berlin, the di&s;tance is fifty-&s;even German, or about two hundred and fifty Engli&s;h miles.</P>
<P>The entrance into the metropolis of Pru&s;|&s;ia is airy and elegant; the &s;treets are regu|lar and clean, and the hou&s;es uniform. Near the Pont Neuf, over the Spree, is an eque&s;|trian &s;tatue of Frederick William the Great, which is e&s;teemed a piece of excellent work|man&s;hip. The palace of the Pont Neuf is al&s;o a magnificent pile.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t object that &s;trikes a traveller is the royal palace, called the ca&s;tle. The walls of the grand front are &s;even or eight feet thick, which, though they add to the &s;trength of the building, give a dark and gloomy air to its apartments.</P>
<P>The economy u&s;ed in this court de&s;erves notice. The common articles of furniture are of ma&s;&s;y &s;ilver, in which the fa&s;hion does not exceed &s;even per cent. &s;o that four millions of dollars might be ea&s;ily realized,

&s;hould the exigencies of the &s;tate require it. In this palace are the pictures of Charles V. and his empre&s;s, the frames of which are of &s;olid &s;ilver, and weigh &s;ix hundred and &s;ixty pounds, or &s;ix centners. There is al|&s;o a grand crown lu&s;tre of &s;even centners, and m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y &s;eparate articles of four or five centners weight. A mu&s;ic gallery is beauti|fully ornamented with &s;ilver; and one end of a gallery, for about twenty feet high, and as many in width, is wholly furni&s;hed with gilt plate, which is entirely for pa|rade.</P>
<P>The king's private apartments are &s;imply elegant; the prevailing ta&s;te is &s;tucco gilt. Several of the rooms have tables with pens, ink, and loo&s;e papers, which indicate the di&s;patch of bu&s;ine&s;s, ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">her than the pomp of royalty.

<P>The throne in the audience chamber is of velvet, embroidered with gold, in a grand, but cha&s;te, ta&s;te. In the old quarter of the palace, the mo&s;t remarkable piece of furni|ture is a bed of crim&s;on velvet, adorned with above two hundred cyphers, with electoral crowns, all &s;et with pearls: the chairs in this apartment are all in the &s;ame &s;tile.

<P>The ar&s;enal forms one &s;ide of the palace, and is &s;aid to be well &s;tocked with arms; but as vi&s;iting it is attended with &s;ome di&s;a|greeable ceremonies, our author declined an in&s;pection. The external, however, of this edifice is very fine: it has indeed a profu&s;i|on of ornaments.</P>
<P>From the palace he proceeded to vi&s;it the library, which he ob&s;erves, would be but a mean apartment for a common &s;chool. But its regulations are excellent, and liberty is allowed to every per&s;on who has the appear|ance of a gentleman, to &s;tudy here from ten in the morning till two in the afternoon. In this collection are five hundred Bibles of different languages and editions; and one is kept as a kind of relict, &s;aid to have been that which Charles I. of England u&s;ed on the &s;caffold, and which was pre&s;ented to the Elector of Brandenburgh by Dr. Juxon <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Like other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">lics, this Bible appears to be mul|tiplied.

<P>The opera hou&s;e is an elegant modern edifice, adorned with &s;plendid &s;cenes in an exqui&s;ite ta&s;te. It has three galleries, and is
<PB N="76" REF="035585_0075_10056CABC0BC85B8">
capable of containing two thou&s;and per&s;ons. The columns which &s;upport the roof are ranged in &s;uch a manner as to throw the whole into a grand &s;aloon. The orche&s;tra con&s;i&s;ts of about fifty performers.</P>
<P>This amu&s;ement is entirely &s;upported at the king's expence, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure is made &s;ub&s;ervient to political purpo&s;es. His maje&s;ty is extremely attached to mu&s;ic, and has acquired great knowledge of that &s;ci|ence.</P>
<P>The fortifications of the city of Berlin are regular, though not formidable. The French language is almo&s;t as prevalent here as the German. Many or the public &s;truc|tures are magnificent, and the &s;treets being regular, give the whole an air of grandeur.</P>
<P>Several thou&s;ands of French manufacturers having found protection in this country, the arts and manufactures are carried to a great degree of beauty and perfection. Gold and &s;ilver lace, and wrought &s;ilks, are &s;carcely to be purcha&s;ed on &s;uch advantageous terms in any other place.</P>
<P>Before Mr. Hanway left Berlin his curi|o&s;ity carried him to Charlottenburg, about a German league di&s;tant. This palace was fou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">d by his maje&s;ty's grandfather, but has been fini&s;hed in a fine &s;tyle by the pre|&s;ent &s;overeign.

decorated with bu&s;ts, &s;tatues, and large mir|rors.</P>
<P>Mr. Hanway's character of Frederic II. king of Pru&s;&s;ia, from the impartiality of the author, de&s;erves to be recorded. He &s;ays, that he had an early ta&s;te for literature and the polite arts, and di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by the delicacy of his manners, in oppo&s;ition to the inelegant cu&s;toms that prevailed in his father's court. The late king was much addicted to drinking, a reigning vice in Germany: the prince abominated this bea&s;t|ly practice, and in con&s;equence of this and other cau&s;es of di&s;&s;atisfaction, he determin|ed to retire from court in a private manner, and take up his re&s;idence in England; but his intentions being di&s;covered, an unhappy gentleman, who was in his confidence, lo&s;t his head, and the plan was fru&s;trated.</P>
<P>When princes are really God's vicege|rents, religion mu&s;t be the ba&s;is of their go|vernment. This prince, however, is by ma|ny reputed a free thinker of the wor&s;t cla&s;s; but the rule of his government, and his ex|emption from the vanities and mean gratifi|cations of life, do not favour &s;o har&s;h a judgment.</P>
<P>In one circum&s;tance his maje&s;ty excels any European potentate; I mean in economy. The allowance of his table is but thirty crowns a day, fi&s;h and wine excepted, in which he is by no means extravagant. Pot&s;|dam is his favorite re&s;idence, and here he a|voids the empty parade of a court. He en|tertains
<PB N="78" REF="035585_0077_10056CAF62180700">
at his table twelve per&s;ons: his fa|vourite mini&s;ters and foreign amba&s;&s;adors, who happen to be in attendance there, are fir&s;t invited, and his military officers, even to an en&s;ign fill up the vacant places. But this is not the only method he takes to in|gratiate him&s;elf with his &s;oldiery. The hum|ble&s;t officer knows that his injuries will be redre&s;&s;ed by the king; for wherever he may be &s;tationed, he needs only to write to his &s;ove|reign, and by the return of the po&s;t he may expect an an&s;wer, frequently written by the prince's own hand. He &s;ometimes even conde&s;cends to advi&s;e, where he thinks the party errs in judgment, or is influenced by unrea&s;onable de&s;ires.</P>
<P>His conver&s;ation is free and ea&s;y, even to plea&s;antry; but he knows how to &s;upport his dignity, not only through fear but affec|tion.</P>
<P>He is choice in his food, but eats mode|rately; and mixes water with his wine. He takes Spani&s;h &s;nuff to exce&s;s, and his clothes frequently bear the marks of this harmle&s;s though inelegant practice.</P>
<P>His face is florid, and his looks inclined to the pen&s;ive, or rather are expre&s;&s;ive of the ince&s;&s;ant labour of the mind. He begins to &s;toop, and is plump rather than corpulent. He often appears in boots, and always in regimentals; and he is ma&s;ter only of one change for the winter, and another for the &s;ummer. Our author &s;aw his wardrobe, which is either mean or noble, according to

the impre&s;&s;ion it makes on the &s;pectator. Little minds, which are caught by &s;how, will receive &s;mall gratification from the di&s;|play.</P>
<P>So little does he ob&s;erve u&s;ele&s;s forms, that he has ri&s;en from his chair at his wri|ting table, and ordered his &s;ecretary to take his place, and write down what he dictated &s;tanding. He often a&s;ks his mo&s;t familiar favourites, if they think the condition of a king de&s;irable above all others: and then tells them how ea&s;ily they may rectify their opinion, by ob&s;erving what labour and at|tention the duties of a king impo&s;e on him.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides his great &s;kill in mu&s;ic, in which he is a compo&s;er as well as a performer, he has a ta&s;te for poetry; and after undergoing the fatigues of a general in the day, he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es &s;uch tranquillity as to an&s;wer letters of plea&s;ure and politene&s;s in the evening, or even to compo&s;e ver&s;es</P>
<P>The grand &s;ecret of life, with regard to the execution of bu&s;ine&s;s of every kind, is a proper di&s;tribution of the &s;everal hours of the day; which nobody under&s;tands better than his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty. He generally goes to bed early, and, after &s;even or eight hours re&s;t, gets up, and pur&s;ues his &s;tated routine of bu&s;ine&s;s or amu&s;ement. When not en|gaged in war, he generally &s;pends a &s;hort time every morning in playing on the Ger|man flute, before he enters his cabinet, where he &s;tays till eleven: he then receives foreign mini&s;ters, and tran&s;acts other pub|lic

avocations till noon; when he u&s;ually goes abroad and gratifies him&s;elf in perform|ing the duties of a general, and keeping up the &s;pirit of di&s;cipline. Soon after one, dinner is &s;erved up: about three, a &s;ecretary comes to read to him; and in the evening he has a concert. This is the u&s;ual mode in which he fills up the day; and the regulari|ty of the &s;overeign is carried into every de|partment of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>His reputation is e&s;tabli&s;hed on the firm|e&s;t foundation, was it only for that bold and generous &s;troke in politics, by which he de|livered his country from the jaws of hire|ling lawyers, who, before his time, &s;ported with the &s;ufferings of the wretched, and &s;aw unmoved, the tears of the widow. In the Pru&s;&s;ian dominions the deci&s;ion of cau&s;es cannot be protracted to a ruinous length, nor carried to an enormous expence.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We will venture to affirm, that a prompt and cheap execution of di&s;tributive ju&s;tice, is one of the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ings of any country, and without it, no country can be happy.</NOTE></P>
<P>Pot&s;dam is agreeably &s;ituated on a branch of the Spree, and is an elegant and regular town. The palace is &s;mall but hand&s;ome; and &s;ome of the apartments are richly fur|ni&s;hed with works of mechanic art, and the fine&s;t productions of ta&s;te and genius</P>
<P>Here the royal guards are quartered, who amount to two thou&s;and men, all of large &s;tature, per&s;onable, and well clothed. They
<PB N="81" REF="035585_0080_10056CB5DEDCF0A0">
are di&s;tingui&s;hed by wearing &s;ilver laced hats and black cockades. His pre&s;ent maje&s;ty has wi&s;ely declined the oppre&s;&s;ive mea&s;ures practi&s;ed by his father, to keep up a race of giants, and yet they are &s;till remarkably tall. The officers dine every day in a large apartment at the king's expence.</P>
<P>The Pru&s;&s;ian &s;oldiers, in general, have re|markably &s;hort coats, &s;trengthened at the elbows with leather, in the form of a heart; which prevents the nece&s;&s;ity of patching an old garment. A &s;oldier here is never &s;een in rags; but as far as re&s;pects per&s;onal neatne&s;s, all appear to be gentlemen. The guards, and &s;ome other regiments, have new clothes every year; but in general, two &s;uits &s;erve for three years. The pay of a common &s;oldi|er is eight gro&s;ch, or fourteen pence a week, out of which they are &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;pend three pence in wa&s;hing, and in materials for cleaning their arms; but it &s;hould be ob&s;erv|ed, that they are furni&s;hed with bread gra|tis</P>
<P>Our traveller next vi&s;ited Sans Souci, in the vicinity of Pot&s;dam. It &s;tands on an e|minence, and enjoys a fine view of the town, and a &s;mall branch of the Spree which wa&s;h|es the gardens. The apartments are chiefly on the ground floor, and are &s;plendidly fur|ni&s;hed From the palace to the lower end of the garden is a de&s;cent of one hundred and twenty yards, by &s;ix &s;everal ranges of &s;tone &s;teps, and as many terraces, the &s;ides
<PB N="82" REF="035585_0081_10056CB80C410238">
of which are planted with vines under gla&s;s frames, by which means the grapes are brought to great perfection. The lower part of the garden is adorned with &s;everal fine &s;ta|tues, particularly Venus drawing a net, and a Diana with game, on pede&s;tals, richly or|namented with alto relievo. At the ea&s;tern extremity is an Egyptian pyramid embelli&s;h|ed with hieroglyphics.</P>
<P>Mr Hanway now took his leave of Ber|lin, and proceeded through woods and &s;andy plains to Britzen, which is the Pru&s;&s;ian fron|tier. He then entered the Electorate of Saxony, where the brightne&s;s of the verdure, the richne&s;s of the &s;oil, and the various pro|ductions of nature, both animate and inani|mate, gave the idea of plenty, &s;uperior to what he had &s;een in Pru&s;&s;ia; yet, many of the inhabitants of the latter have been tempt|ed, by political advantages, to change their country for the more &s;teril &s;oil of Pru&s;&s;ia. Hence the towns erected by his Pru&s;&s;ian ma|je&s;ty on his frontiers, are almo&s;t wholly peo|pled by Saxons.</P>
<P>At length our author arrived at Witten|burg, a fortified town on the Elbe, famous for a manufactory of coar&s;e cloth, the wool of this country being good and plentiful. Clothes are &s;ent hither from all parts to be dyed, and the blues and greens, commonly called Saxon, here are &s;uppo&s;ed to receive their fine&s;t tints.</P>
<P>In this place is an academy, with nearly &s;even hundred &s;tudents, and here is the So|koloff
<PB N="83" REF="035585_0082_10056CBAC9DA81B8">
church, where Martin Luther fir&s;t preached the doctrine which gave ri&s;e to the reformation. In this church too, that great reformer is inferred; but has no other mo|nument than a bra&s;s plate with an in&s;cripti|on, except his original portrait painted on wood, and well pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>The people here have a &s;trong tincture of the Romi&s;h &s;uper&s;tition, and the credulous maintain, that the devil vi&s;ited Luther in the library, now belonging to the academy; but that the reformer received him by throw|ing his ink&s;tand at his head.</P>
<P>In pa&s;&s;ing through this electorate, Mr. Hanway ob&s;erved, that the fertility of the &s;oil did not operate much to increa&s;e the o|pulence of the inhabitants. On the 25th, he &s;aw Mol&s;berg, a hunting palace of the Elector of Saxony, &s;ituated on an eminence near the village of I&s;engberg Its approach is by a long avenue, planted with wild che&s;|nut trees, and is encompa&s;&s;ed by woods, in which the prince takes &s;uch delight in hunting the wild boar, that he fixes his re|&s;idence here &s;ometimes for months &s;ucce&s;|&s;ively.</P>
<P>Hunting, indeed is the favourite diver|&s;ion of the Saxon court, but by indulging this too far, the &s;ubjects are more di&s;tre&s;&s;ed than the brutes. Above thirty thou&s;and head of deer are &s;aid to range in the open fields and fore&s;ts; but though they commit terrible depredations on the crops of the farmer, he dares not kill one, under the pe|nalty
<PB N="84" REF="035585_0083_10056CBCEF3FBFB8">
of being &s;ent to the gallies. In every town of note, five men keep watch every night by rotation to frighten the deer away, will bells, from de&s;troying their corn.</P>
<P>The pea&s;ants of this country carry their provi&s;ions to market from a great di&s;tance in wheelbarrows, who&s;e &s;tructure is well adapt|ed for this purpo&s;e. The wheel is bound with iron, and is both larger and lighter than tho&s;e u&s;ed in England</P>
<P>Dre&s;den, the capital, is &s;eated in the mid&s;t of a plain, &s;urrounded by lofty di&s;|tant hills, the neare&s;t of which are convert|ed into vineyards. The Elbe divides it into two parts, over which is a &s;tone bridge, five hundred and forty feet long, and thirty-&s;ix broad, con&s;i&s;ting of eighteen arches Up|on this &s;tructure &s;tands a brazen crucifix of curious workman&s;hip.</P>
<P>The city contains many hand&s;ome build|ings, &s;ix or &s;even &s;tories high, and &s;everal elegant &s;quares Near the entrance of what is called the New city is an eque&s;trian &s;tatue of Augu&s;tus II. erected on a lofty pede&s;tal, &s;aid to have been executed by a common &s;mith, and as &s;uch de&s;erves admiration, though it has many capital defects</P>
<P>The trade of Dre&s;den is very incon&s;idera|ble, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly in &s;ilver ingots, brought every fifteen days from the mines of F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">id|burg, to the amount of twenty thou&s;and dollars. This &s;ilver is immediately coined into florins, of higher value than the cur|rent coin, on which account it is conveyed
<PB N="85" REF="035585_0084_10056CBE7165E3A8">
into the neighbouring territories, and melt|ed down into pieces of other denominations.</P>
<P>Among the calamities under which this electorate labours, that of religious jealou&s;y is none of the lea&s;t. The Lutheran clergy oppre&s;s the Calvini&s;ts; while both think them&s;elves extremely injured, by the coun|tenance given at court to the Roman Catho|lics. The Prote&s;tants deem it a gro&s;s ab&s;ur|dity to be ruled by a Catholic prince; for, according to the e&s;tabli&s;hed Saxon con&s;titu|tion only one Catholic church can be allow|ed at Dre&s;den. A chapel, however, is con|nived at, as a private place of wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>Our author vi&s;ited the Grune Gewolbe, a part of the royal palace, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;eve|ral apartments; replete with curio&s;ities, which have been collected at an immen&s;e expence.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t chamber contains one hundred &s;mall, but exqui&s;ite, &s;tatues, principally in bra&s;s. Among others, are an eque&s;trian &s;ta|tue of Augu&s;tus II. King of Poland, Fre|deric William the Great of Pru&s;&s;ia, after the famous &s;tatue of Berlin, Lewis XIV. Mer|curius, Centaurs, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The &s;econd chamber contains a variety of ivory figures, among which are Abraham offering up his &s;on I&s;aac, with the angel de|&s;cending, all of exqui&s;ite workman&s;hip; a fine crucifix; and a &s;hip completely rigged, with ropes of gold wire.</P>
<P>The third is filled with &s;ilver ornaments, in particular, a large fountain, and four va&s;es of va&s;t &s;ize.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="035585_0085_10056CC08F762140">The fourth contains ve&s;&s;els of pure gold, and &s;ilver gilt. The pannels of this apart|ment are of looking gla&s;s</P>
<P>The fifth is a &s;pacious room, in which are many precious &s;tones, wrought with great art; a cup of lapis nephriticus; a &s;tatue of Charles II. of England; a hall of cry&s;tal, &s;ix inches in diameter, without a blemi&s;h; a large goblet &s;et round with the mo&s;t cu|rious and co&s;tly antiques; &s;everal tables in mo&s;aic; and the angel Michael vanqui&s;hing the devil, admirably executed in wood, and which co&s;t in England, where it was made, two thou&s;and five hundred pounds.</P>
<P>The &s;ixth chamber contains a collection of precious &s;tones, with an infinite variety of pearls, &s;et in a multiplicity of forms.</P>
<P>The &s;eventh and eighth apartments are &s;tored with jewels of immen&s;e value, inclo&s;|ed in gla&s;s ca&s;es. Among other rich curio|&s;ities, is a repre&s;entation of the throne of the Great Mogul, in &s;ilver figures enamelled, and adorned with precious &s;tones, with a view of princes offering their pre&s;ents, and falling pro&s;trate, with elephants, &s;oldiers, &s;ervants, and attendants.</P>
<P>Mr. Hanway having gratified his curio&s;i|ty here, paid a vi&s;it to the cabinet of curi|o&s;ities, called the Kun&s;tkammer</P>
<P>The fir&s;t chamber contains a &s;eries of prints, from the commencement of engrav|ing to the pre&s;ent time.</P>
<P>The &s;econd is filled with minerals, ores, and earths, from every country.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="035585_0086_10056CC3404CD7E0">The third contains petrifactions, particu|larly of animals and wood.</P>
<P>In the fourth chamber are different kinds of wood, and other vegetable productions; in particular, a cabinet, with three hundred and fifty &s;quares, about the &s;ize of the palm of a hand, all run in flat, as drawers, of as many different kinds of wood. In this apart|ment, likewi&s;e, are the portraits of a man and his wife, who lived near Tami&s;war: the man was one hundred and eighty-five years old, and the woman one hundred and &s;eventy-two.</P>
<P>In the fifth chamber is a &s;mall cabinet of &s;keletons, and other anatomical prepara|tions. The &s;ixth contains the &s;kins of many different animals &s;tuffed. The &s;eventh the &s;kins of fi&s;hes &s;tuffed. The eighth is devoted to &s;hells. In the ninth is a cabinet of about &s;ix feet high and four broad, every drawer of which has &s;ome natural curio&s;ity in am|ber. In the tenth is a grotto with &s;prings of water The eleventh contains corals The twelfth is filled with the &s;keletons of lions, bears, and other extraordinary animals, par|ticularly that of a hor&s;e, who&s;e mane is &s;aid to be three ell and a half long, and his tail twelve and a half.</P>
<P>Our author was then &s;hewn, in an apart|ment at &s;ome di&s;tance, a model of Solomon's temple, with all its furniture, which co&s;t twelve thou&s;and crowns.</P>
<P>The gallery of pictures next fell under his ob&s;ervation, which is one of the fine&s;t
<PB N="88" REF="035585_0087_10056CC571657A30">
in the world. It contains one hundred pieces of &s;uperlative value, all &s;aid to be originals, and to have co&s;t half a million of crowns. The whole collection con&s;i&s;ts of above two thou&s;and pieces, the capital works of Ra|phael, Rubens, and Corregio. Their aggre|gate value is about half a million &s;terling.</P>
<P>The Chine&s;e palace, as it is called, is a capital object of attraction. It &s;tands on the Elbe, and is built in the Chine&s;e ta&s;te throughout. In its different apartments are many natural and artificial curio&s;ities, too numerous to be particularized. Among other articles are forty-eight China va&s;es of great &s;ize, with which the father of the pre&s;ent elector was &s;o charmed, that he purcha&s;ed them of the late king of Pru&s;&s;ia, at the price of a whole regiment of dragoons.</P>
<P>The royal gardens, though fine, want that charm which ari&s;es from an inequality of ground. They contain a &s;mall palace, in the front of which is a field for tournaments, and behind a &s;heet of water. They are a|dorned with a profu&s;ion of marble &s;tatues, many of them colo&s;&s;al; and pourtray the ge|nius of the late King of Poland, Elector of Saxony, who, being entirely devoted to his amours, left them as monuments of his la|civiou&s;ne&s;s</P>
<P>Some of the palaces of the grandees are very beautiful, particularly that of Count Bruhl, which is fitted up with princely mag|nificence. His library is two hundred and twenty feet long, and well furni&s;hed with
<PB N="89" REF="035585_0088_10056CC6F3348158">
books. Nor is his gallery of pictures much inferior to &s;ome royal collections.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid that Saxony contains thirty thou&s;and towns and villages, of which &s;ixty are to be &s;een from &s;ome eminences near Dre&s;den. The population of the electorate is computed at four millions; but this &s;eems to be exaggerated. The people are burthen|ed with many heavy taxes, and the expenc|es of the court, in delicacies only, is &s;aid to be twice as much as the King of Pru&s;&s;ia allows for his whole table.</P>
<P>During Mr. Hanway's re&s;idence here, he was introduced to M. Calkoen, who had been amba&s;&s;ador from the United Nether|lands to the Ottoman Porte, and was now envoy to the King of Poland.</P>
<P>He had formerly re&s;ided in England, and profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf an admirer of that nation. At his table were Polanders, Italians, French, and Germans. The conver&s;ation, at fir&s;t, turned on Nadir Shah, when our author was a&s;ked, which of the countries he had &s;een he thought mo&s;t agreeable, and where a man of &s;entiment would chu&s;e to &s;pend his days. Mr. Hanway mode&s;tly re|plied, that his knowledge of the world was very limited; that he had &s;een a great deal of mi&s;ery in one &s;hape or other, in every country he had vi&s;ited; but, after a pau&s;e, determined in favour of England The com|pany &s;eemed &s;urpri&s;ed at his he&s;itation; and expre&s;&s;ed their &s;uffrage by a loud, but po|lite

applau&s;e, and unanimou&s;ly agreed in prai&s;e of this happy i&s;le.</P>
<P>On the 30th of Augu&s;t, Mr. Hanway left Dre&s;den, and travelled towards Mei&s;&s;en. He was captivated with the rural charms of the country; the corn-fields, the vineyards, and the different pro&s;pects of the Elbe. On approaching Mei&s;&s;en, the valley contracts, and &s;ome of the hou&s;es of this town are built on lofty rocks that ri&s;e perpendicular from the Elbe, and have a mo&s;t romantic appearance.</P>
<P>The ca&s;tle of Mei&s;&s;en, in which the por|celain manufactory is carried on, &s;tands on the we&s;tern bank of the Elbe, and is a large building, capable of &s;ome defence. No per&s;on is admitted here without an order from the governor of Dre&s;den, nor are the workmen allowed to leave the gates, on pain of being clo&s;ely confined; though, in fact, they are all pri&s;oners in a limited &s;en&s;e. They amount to about &s;even hundred; and &s;o moderate is their pay, that the annual expence of this e&s;tabli&s;hment is not e&s;timat|ed at more than eighty thou&s;and crowns. This manufacture, which is kept &s;o &s;ecret, is entirely on the elector's account, who &s;ells porcelain to the amount of one hun|dred and fifty, or two hundred thou&s;and crowns a year.</P>
<P>After pa&s;&s;ing the Elbe, and mounting a &s;teep a&s;cent, our author entered on a fine champaign country, where the &s;oil is rich and well cultivated, and towns and villages
<PB N="91" REF="035585_0090_10056CCBCEF905E8">
agreeably intermixed. At length he arrived at St. Hubert&s;berg, another hunting pa|lace, belonging to the elector, which is ex|tremely well &s;ituated for its de&s;tination. This building is large, and &s;ome of the a|partments are &s;uperlatively fine.</P>
<P>Proceeding on his journey, he met with nothing worth notice till he came to Leip|&s;ic, one of the greate&s;t trading towns of Germany, though it has no river of any mag|nitude near it. Here are three fairs,&mdash;on New Year's Day, Ea&s;ter, and Michaelmas, to which re&s;ort, people of almo&s;t every Eu|ropean nation, either to buy or &s;ell. But what adds to the pre-eminence of Leip&s;ic over many cities, which have &s;uperior local advantages is that liberty of con&s;cience granted to all religions <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is a&s;toni&s;hing that the obvious advantages re|&s;ulting from toleration, have not yet put a final end to bigotry, and that men &s;hould &s;till be weak enough to think they honour God by per&s;ecuting his crea|tures.</NOTE> Hence the inhabi|tants are di&s;tingui&s;hed for their indu&s;try, and their progre&s;s in moral and intellectual improvement. This is the &s;eat of a con&s;ide|rable univer&s;ity. The inhabitants amount to about forty thou&s;and within the walls, and the &s;uburbs are al&s;o very populous.</P>
<P>The fortifications &s;eem rather calculated for the u&s;e of the inhabitants to walk on, than for defence. The citizens, however, maintain two hundred &s;oldiers. The &s;treets
<PB N="92" REF="035585_0091_10056CCD51B979C0">
are clean and commodious, and the hou&s;es in general are lofty, with elegant fronts.</P>
<P>In the vicinity of Leip&s;ic are fine gar|dens; that called the Apel garden, in parti|cular, is laid out in an excellent ta&s;te, and is ornamented with &s;tatues, which, though not ma&s;terly performances, are &s;o ranged as to have a plea&s;ing effect.</P>
<P>In his road to Land&s;perg, Mr. Hanway had a di&s;tant view of Hall, famous for its univer&s;ity. At Land&s;perg he re-entered the Pru&s;&s;ian dominions; the tran&s;ition from one &s;overeignty to another, being very rapid in Germany, from the intermixture of proper|ty, and the &s;mall extent of principalities. Indeed the &s;ubjects of the petty &s;tates of Germany, which are very numerous, are the mo&s;t oppre&s;&s;ed of human beings. Their princes, by every art of exaction, can &s;carcely rai&s;e enough to &s;upport their af|fected dignity; though it may be &s;uppo&s;|ed that their nece&s;&s;ities render them ingeni|ous in devi&s;ing the means of obtaining &s;up|plies. Yet poverty and morality &s;eem in this country at lea&s;t to be intimately allied; for thefts and robberies are hardly known.</P>
<P>On the 3d of September, our author ar|rived at Magdeburg, di&s;tingui&s;hed for its for|tifications, which are immen&s;ely &s;trong. This city is under the &s;overeignty of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, and is remarkable for its magazines of merchandi&s;e, which are &s;pread from this centre over the &s;urrounding country. In the great &s;quare is an ancient &s;tatue of the em|peror
<PB N="93" REF="035585_0092_10056CCF79B4E360">
Otho, who is &s;aid to have founded this city in the year 930</P>
<P>Soon after quitting Magdeburg, Mr. Han|way had a fracas with a cu&s;tom-hou&s;e offi|cer, on account of the po&s;tillion attempting to evade the payment of a certain duty. However, by his &s;pirited conduct, he brought him&s;elf off in the mo&s;t honourable manner, and was allowed to pur&s;ue his journey with|out mole&s;tation. It &s;hould be ob&s;erved, that the German po&s;tillions wear the liveries of the countries to which they belong; and u&s;e &s;mall French horns, which &s;ome of them &s;ound in no unplea&s;ant manner.</P>
<P>At Helm&s;tet, belonging to the Duke of Brun&s;wick, are two hundred &s;tudents, chief|ly &s;upported by the bounty of their &s;ove|reign. Four German miles farther, lies Wol|&s;inbuttel, where our traveller arrived after the gates were &s;hut, but procured admi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The fortifications are neat and regular, and the hou&s;es appear comfortable, but not grand. The ducal palace an&s;wers the &s;ame de&s;cription; but it has &s;everal well-furni&s;h|ed apartments, and two &s;mall galleries of pictures. Mr. Hanway declined &s;eeing the public library, for want of time to examine its contents, thinking that the &s;imple view of books is a more barren entertainment, than &s;urveying the &s;ky, without contem|plating him who made it.</P>
<P>Next day he reached Brun&s;wick, a well fortified place. This is the ducal re&s;idence, and has an ar&s;enal well filled with every kind

of armour and ordnance. On the ramparts is a bra&s;s mortar piece, made in 1411, which is ten feet long, and nine feet in diameter. It requires fifty-two pounds of powder to charge it, and will carry a ball of &s;even hundred and thirty pounds weight to the di&s;tance of thirty-two thou&s;and paces, and throw a bomb of one thou&s;and pounds weight.</P>
<P>The military are clothed and trained near|ly after the Pru&s;&s;ian model: in times of peace they are e&s;timated at thirteen thou&s;and men; and yet the revenues of the country are &s;aid not to exceed two hundred and &s;ixty thou|&s;and pounds &s;terling a year.</P>
<P>Brun&s;wick contains &s;everal churches, one of which is a very ancient Gothic &s;tructure, and has its ceiling ornamented with twenty large paintings, repre&s;enting the prophets in the Old Te&s;tament in the clouds of heaven, which communicate a very &s;olemn air to the edifice. The high al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> is of marble, &s;up|ported by Aaron and Mo&s;es, and &s;urround|ed by &s;tatues of the four evangeli&s;ts.</P>
<P>This court is di&s;tingui&s;hed for its polite|ne&s;s, particularly to the Engli&s;h, who pa&s;s this way The duke &s;eems more attached to ea&s;e and happine&s;s, than vain parade. His coach is generally attended by no more than &s;even &s;ervants, and &s;ome of his family al|ways occupy the vacant &s;eats.</P>
<P>The palace of Saltzdahlen &s;tands above a German mile from Brun&s;wick, and is chief|ly con&s;tructed of timber, lined with painted cloth, which gives the apartments an air of

grandeur at a &s;mall expence. The picture gallery is a noble apartment, and contains many capital productions of the pencil. The left wing is furni&s;hed in a grote&s;que ta&s;te, with porcelain; and another is filled with painted enamelled ware, great part of which is &s;aid to have been executed by Raphael d'Urbino, while he was enamoured of the potter's daughter.</P>
<P>Among the mo&s;t celebrated paintings, are Adam and Eve viewing the dead body of Abel, and trying to open his eyes; Abra|ham embracing his own &s;on, after the trial which God had made of his faith; Peter delivered from pri&s;on by the angel; Judith and her attendant holding the head of Ho|lifernes, which &s;till &s;eems to retain the la&s;t traces of life; Cephalus and Procris; and various others.</P>
<P>The dutchy of Brun&s;wick carries on a pretty exten&s;ive trade with Bohemia. It a|bounds in hops, e&s;teemed the be&s;t in the em|pire; and much oil is made from turnip &s;eed.</P>
<P>On approaching the city of Hanover, it appeared embo&s;omed in trees, through which vi&s;tas are cut; and &s;o exten&s;ive are the woods in the environs, that though our author &s;ays it was computed eighty thou&s;and trees had been blown down in a late &s;torm, they could &s;carcely be mi&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Hanover, in many re&s;pects, is a plea&s;ant place, and may be e&s;teemed elegant. It is wa&s;hed by the Lena, a branch of the Alie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">

which runs into the We&s;er, and con&s;equent|ly it has a communication with Bremen.</P>
<P>The electoral palace is &s;eated on the banks of the Lena. It has &s;everal courts, and many grand and commodious apart|ments, &s;ome of which are hung with very rich tape&s;try. The opera-hou&s;e and the the|atre for the French comedians are both with|in the palace. During the winter, plays are regularly performed, and concerts are given twice a week, when the courtiers, without exception, take place, according to their mi|litary rank. A guard is always mounted, and an open table kept for the council of &s;tate, even when the king is not in his elec|toral dominions.</P>
<P>The military force, in time of peace, is about twenty-four thou&s;and men, and the re|venues of the electorate amount to &s;even hundred thou&s;and pounds, a con&s;iderable part of which ari&s;es from the &s;ilver mines.</P>
<P>Herenhau&s;en, &s;ituated about two Engli&s;h miles to the north of Hanover, is always con&s;idered as an object of attraction to tra|vellers. Our author &s;ays, he knows not whe|ther he was more mortified or &s;urpri&s;ed, to find that this celebrated palace fell va&s;tly &s;hort of his expectations. It was built in the year 1670, by the elector Erne&s;t Au|gu&s;tus; the greate&s;t part is of wood, and though the apartments are large, they are far from being magnificent Some of the furniture, however, is rich, and the pictures de&s;erve admiration.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="035585_0096_100556BFD3DF6700">The gardens are very beautiful. Mr. Han|way &s;ays he had &s;een none in Germany to be compared with them, though they were not laid out in that exqui&s;ite ta&s;te, of which there are &s;o numerous &s;pecimens in England. They are adorned with &s;tatues; and the jet d'eau, formed in 1716, by Mr. Ben&s;on, per|haps, is unrivalled, as it throws up the wa|ter &s;eventy feet high. Here, according to the German ta&s;te, is a &s;ylvan theatre, adorn|ed with &s;tatues, on which are &s;ometimes ex|hibited plays and ma&s;querades.</P>
<P>On the 15th of September, Mr. Hanway &s;et out for Zell. By the road, he ob&s;erved in &s;everal places, the remains of ancient buildings, about three feet high, which the vulgar ridiculou&s;ly imagine are of an era coe|val with the deluge</P>
<P>Zell, which is &s;ubject to Hanover, is a con&s;iderable fortified place The palace is &s;ituated on an eminence commanding a fine pro&s;pect, and is it&s;elf a &s;trong po&s;t. The hou&s;es are mo&s;tly mean wooden &s;tructures. This place has an incon&s;iderable trade with Bremen, by means of the river Aller.</P>
<P>In his way to Wei&s;&s;endorf, he pa&s;&s;ed through a barren country, fit only to &s;up|port flocks of &s;heep; and indeed this elec|torate &s;upplies the greate&s;t part of Germa|ny with mutton, as We&s;tphalia does with hogs, and Hungary with be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f</P>
<P>On the 17th he arrived a Hamburg, be|low which city the banks of the Elbe in

&s;ome places ri&s;e to a great height, and af|ford a delightful view of &s;everal i&s;lets in the middle of the river, which is five or &s;ix miles broad.</P>
<P>Hamburg is one of the towns belonging to the Han&s;eatic league, and is a place of the greate&s;t importance. Its &s;ituation for trade, and the reputation of its laws and go|vernment have peopled it with opulent mer|chants, who carry on an exten&s;ive com|merce. It &s;tands in the dutchy of Hol&s;tein, on the north &s;ide of the Elbe, where that river forms many i&s;lands, and &s;ome of the &s;treets are &s;o low, as to be frequently inun|dated by the tides.</P>
<P>The hou&s;es in general are &s;ub&s;tantially built, and make a &s;tately appearance; but many of the &s;treets are &s;o narrow, as to render it difficult to u&s;e wheel carriages. However, there are &s;ome parts of the town which are open and airy; but the&s;e being more remote from the river, are le&s;s fre|quented by commercial people.</P>
<P>Hamburgh is, with re&s;pect to Germany, what Am&s;terdam is to Europe&mdash;the general emporium of natural produce and manufac|ture. By means of canals, &s;hips may unload at the warehou&s;es, which are &s;tored with the mo&s;t valuable commodities.</P>
<P>The whole number of ve&s;&s;els, of con&s;ide|rable burden, belonging to the town, is computed at four hundred; &s;ome of the large&s;t of which trade to and from London. The Briti&s;h factory here is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of as
<PB N="99" REF="035585_0098_10056CDAA327FC18">
many di&s;tingui&s;hed privileges as any body of foreigners enjoy in the commercial world.</P>
<P>The fortifications on the land &s;ide are reckoned very &s;trong. The walks round the ramparts extend about four Engli&s;h miles, and, in mo&s;t places, are very plea&s;ant. On the ea&s;t &s;ide of the town is a fine piece of water, formed by the Al&s;ter, within the walls, which, in the &s;ummer, is covered with plea&s;ure-boats. The citizens have &s;everal gar|dens on the banks of the Elbe and the Al|&s;ter; they are kept in the neate&s;t trim; and, from their diminutive &s;ize, appear more like a puppet-&s;how than a rural &s;cene.</P>
<P>The city is divided into five pari&s;hes, which have as many capital churches. Lu|therani&s;m is the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion, and Roman Catholics are objects of great jea|lou&s;y; but the Jews, the univer&s;al brokers of nations, live unmole&s;ted.</P>
<P>The government of Hamburg is ve&s;ted in four burgoma&s;ters, and twenty-four &s;ena|tors; fourteen of whom are cho&s;en from a|mong the merchants, and ten from the pro|fe&s;&s;ors of the law. There are al&s;o four &s;yn|dics, who act as &s;ecretaries of &s;tate, and as many profe&s;&s;ed &s;ecretaries. Be&s;ides, every pari&s;h has the appointment of three officers, in the nature of the tribunes among the an|cient Romans; and nothing of moment is determined by the &s;enate without their con|currence. The population within the walls may be computed at one hundred and eighty thou&s;and &s;ouls, and it is probable, that the
<PB N="100" REF="035585_0099_10056CF24EBCC420">
&s;uburbs and adjacent villages contain about half that number. Except &s;ugar-baking and cotton printing, the manufactures of this place are very incon&s;iderable.</P>
<P>The better &s;ort of people, among the men, are very affable; but the women ap|pear re&s;erved. State and grandeur are here lo&s;t in the &s;uperiour attention to commercial pur&s;uits. Indeed the ea&s;y circum&s;tances of the majority of the inhabitants, and the e|quality of the con&s;titution under which they live, have infu&s;ed a certain degree of repub|lican independence, which tinctures their manners. This &s;pirit of in&s;ubordination is perceptible even in the lowe&s;t cla&s;&s;es; not that it prompts them to acts of riot, but it gives them a kind of con&s;equence, which, where the gradations of rank are ob&s;erved, would appear in&s;olent.</P>
<P>On the 20th of September, Mr. Hanway proceeded to Blankene&s;s by a delightful road, on the banks of the Elbe, which af|fords a fine and exten&s;ive view of part of the Hanoverian dominions on the we&s;t, and of Hol&s;tein an appendage of Denmark, on the ea&s;t. For &s;ome days he ob&s;erved nothing worth notice in the country or towns thro' which he pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>On the 1&s;t of October, he reached Clo&s;ter Seven. The &s;urrounding territory is thinly inhabited; but, as he approached Bremen, the a&s;pect in fertility and population began to improve About three Engli&s;h miles from Bremen, he ob&s;erved three &s;tones bear|ing
<PB N="101" REF="035585_0100_100556C7BA15F6F0">
the Briti&s;h arms, which mark the limits of the Hanoverian dominions.</P>
<P>Bremen is &s;eated on a plain, on both &s;ides of the We&s;er, over which it has a bridge. This dutchy formerly belonged to Sweden; but being conquered by the Danes, was &s;old to the Elector of Hanover in 1716; yet only a &s;mall part of the town is &s;ubject to that electorate. The re&s;t, with its adjacent territory, is independent, and is governed by its own laws and magi&s;trates.</P>
<P>Calvini&s;m is the prevailing religion here, and there are five churches for citizens of that per&s;ua&s;ion. The inhabitants amount to thirty thou&s;and; and, were we to judge from the frequent appearance of Soli Deo Gloria, painted in large characters over their doors and windows, both within and with|out, we &s;hould conclude that they were pi|ous indeed.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the &s;treets are narrow, but many of the buildings make a hand&s;ome appear|ance, and the &s;hops are full of merchan|di&s;e. In the market-place is the figure of a giant fourteen feet high, clothed in armour, &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">id to repre&s;ent a general who &s;aved the ci|ty when it was in the utmo&s;t danger from its enemies.

It is built in the Go|thic &s;tyle, and &s;eems to po&s;&s;e&s;s the quality of pre&s;erving the bodies of the dead from corruption.

The vault in which they were depo&s;ited, is about &s;ix feet below the &s;urface of the earth, arched over, and &s;eems to have nothing extraordinary, ex|cept that the air is temperate, and perfectly dry.</P>
<P>Several per&s;ons have offered con&s;iderable &s;ums to have their bodies depo&s;ited in this receptacle of mortality: but the prie&s;ts, it is &s;aid, refu&s;ed the idle boon; alleging that it is the decree of heaven, "that man &s;hould return to the du&s;t from which he was made."</P>
<P>The vicinity of Bremen being &s;ubject to inundations, a long cau&s;eway is rai&s;ed for the convenience of travelling. Pa&s;&s;ing along this, Mr. Hanway re-entered the Pru&s;&s;ian dominions, and at length arrived at Wilde|&s;hau&s;en, a principal town, and the re&s;idence of the great bailiff of the di&s;trict.</P>
<P>From thence he advanced to Ha&s;&s;elune, a pretty agreeable town, in the electorate of Cologn. Poverty and &s;uper&s;tition reign here unrivalled: a crucifix is erected on almo&s;t e|very &s;pot &s;ubject to ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>Lingen was the next &s;tage. This lies in the circle of We&s;tphalia, and is &s;ubject to the King of Pru&s;&s;ia The town is fortified, and the buildings are neat, the general cha|racter of places under the &s;overeignty of Pru&s;&s;ia.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="035585_0102_10056CE19F880D50">Our author now approached the confines of the United Netherlands, where the wo|men appeared almo&s;t blinded with the &s;moke ari&s;ing from the turf, which is here the u&s;u|al fuel. The little towns he began to pa&s;s through, exhibited that characteri&s;tic clean|line&s;s, for which the Dutch are &s;o remark|able.</P>
<P>In a &s;hort time he arrived at Daventer, a large city in the province of Overyffel, which formerly con&s;tituted one of the Han&s;e towns, but is now &s;ubject to the States.</P>
<P>It &s;tands on the river Y&s;&s;el, which is na|vigable for ve&s;&s;els of large burden. Over this &s;tream is a wooden bridge, where pa&s;&s;engers are &s;ubject to a heavy toll. The town is well fortified, and has a &s;trong garri&s;on. The hou&s;es and &s;treets are neat, and the inland trade is con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>From hence is a regular &s;tage to Voorthu|&s;en, and about midway is Loo, a famous &s;eat of the Prince of Orange. Voorthu&s;en is a mean village, and the environs are not very inviting.</P>
<P>At the di&s;tance of two German miles be|yond this, lies Amersfort. On approaching this place, evident &s;igns appear of the per|&s;evering indu&s;try of the Dutch. The tobac|co plantations are formed with great labour, and for an article, who&s;e con&s;umption is &s;o univer&s;al in the Netherlands, perhaps no ex|pence or trouble is too great</P>
<P>Amersfort is an ancient and pretty large town, on the &s;mall river Eems, which runs
<PB N="104" REF="035585_0103_10056CE3208875F0">
into the Zuyder Sea. The hou&s;es are clean to an extreme, but the manners of the people are far from being equally delicate; and their ru&s;ticity is &s;hewn in their con|tempt for &s;trangers.</P>
<P>About two Engli&s;h miles from this town &s;tands Soesdyke, a palace belonging to the Orange family, with a park of eight miles in circumference.</P>
<P>Our author being impatient to reach Am|&s;terdam, declined vi&s;iting Utrecht. In his way he pa&s;&s;ed through Naarden, the boun|dary of the province of Holland, and a well fortified place, &s;tanding near the Zuyder Sea. From hence to Am&s;terdam is reckon|ed two German miles. The whole country appears below the level of the &s;ea, but is en|riched with gardens and luxuriant pa&s;tures. In the avenue to Am&s;terdam, is a cau&s;eway lined with villages and gardens, which add greatly to the beauty of this artificial coun|try.</P>
<P>The city of Am&s;terdam, as well as many others in the Netherlands, are works of art and labour, not inferior to the greate&s;t mo|numents of human indu&s;try in ancient times. It &s;tands about two hundred and twenty miles ea&s;tward from London, and derives its name from the river Am&s;tel, or the dam of the Am&s;tel, which, by corruption, a&s;|&s;umes its pre&s;ent appellation.</P>
<P>Our author computes that it is about four hundred years old from its fir&s;t foundation, and two hundred and &s;eventy from the era

that it was inclo&s;ed with walls. In 1570 the Dutch began to lay the ba&s;is of their opu|lence and power. Embracing Calvini&s;m, and wearied with the oppre&s;&s;ions of the Spani&s;h government, they emancipated them&s;elves into liberty, after a long &s;truggle and many conflicts, and formed a great republic.</P>
<P>About the year 1660, the flame of liber|ty occa&s;ioned &s;uch a conflux of people to Am&s;terdam, that the walls were extended, and by &s;ub&s;equent enlargements, they are become three leagues in circuit. The city is e&s;teemed nearly one third as populous as London or Paris; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd within the walls are computed to be twenty-&s;ix thou&s;and five hundred hou&s;es.</P>
<P>The main &s;trength of the place con&s;i&s;ts in the difficulty of acce&s;s both by &s;ea and land; but the numerous &s;hoals that ob&s;truct the mouth of the Texel have proved no bar to commercial enterpri&s;e, though they ren|der navigation dangerous to &s;hips of war. Economy is here perceptible in every thing: even the ba&s;tions of the fortifications, which are very numerous, have each a windmill.</P>
<P>Many of the &s;treets are lined with canals and planted with trees. No wheel carriages are allowed to be drawn here, except on pay|ing a heavy duty. Coaches are &s;et on &s;ledg|es, drawn by one hor&s;e, and on the &s;ame vehicle goods and merchandi&s;e of every kind are conveyed from one place of the town to another.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="035585_0105_10056CE8341655D8">The hou&s;es are rather di&s;tingui&s;hed for neatne&s;s than elegance; and the principal care of the inhabitants &s;eems to be laid out in keeping them clean, which the nature of the climate renders in &s;ome mea&s;ure nece&s;&s;a|ry; but per&s;onal elegance is far from keep|ing pace with dome&s;tic neatne&s;s.</P>
<P>Of all the buildings in Am&s;terdam, the town-hou&s;e is the mo&s;t remarkable Its front extends two hundred and eighty-two feet in length, its depth is two hundred and thirty-two feet, and its height one hundred and &s;ixteen feet, exclu&s;ive of the cupola The expence of its erection co&s;t three millions of Guilders, which, con&s;idering the value of money at that period, is an a&s;toni&s;hing &s;um; but it &s;hould he con&s;idered, that it &s;tands on thirteen thou&s;and large piles of wood, &s;o that the foundation greatly enhanced the expence.</P>
<P>This immen&s;e fabric contains the offices and tribunals for the execution of the laws, in every branch of government. It is night|ly guarded by a body of the burghers, who are charged with the protection of this great re&s;ervoir of the wealth of the United Pro|vinces. The bank, which is kept in the lower apartments, is &s;aid to contain immen&s;e &s;ums of &s;pecie.</P>
<P>The Exchange is likewi&s;e a &s;pacious and convenient &s;tructure. It is &s;upported by forty-&s;ix pillars marked with numbers, and every merchant has his particular &s;tation, that he may be the more ea&s;ily found.</P>

<P>In pa&s;&s;ing over the Ya to Saardam, our author ob&s;erved the various purpo&s;es to which windmills are applied in this country. They are u&s;ed for &s;awing timber, for grinding woods and other materials for dyeing, and for almo&s;t every manufacture to which ma|chinery is applicable.</P>
<P>The dykes are prodigious monuments of labour, and many of them are lined with large &s;tones. That which bounds the Zuyder Sea, is rai&s;ed &s;ixteen feet perpendicular, and goes off on an ea&s;y &s;lope.</P>
<P>The danger of &s;uch a dreadful element as the &s;ea, is almo&s;t equal to that of a volcano, and the Dutch have often &s;uffered from its inroads. In &s;pite of their utmo&s;t &s;kill and indu&s;try, their dykes have proved ineffectual to &s;ecure them. In 1530, a great part of Zealand was overflowed, and in the &s;ame century, &s;eventy-two villages on the coa&s;t of Holland were &s;wallowed up, and twenty thou&s;and people peri&s;hed.

<P>Am&s;terdam is a prodigious magazine of corn, wine, timber, and naval &s;tores. Its herring and whale fi&s;heries bring in immen&s;e wealth; and the rich productions of their oriental po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions being poured in here, add immen&s;ely to the opulence and commerce of this emporium.</P>
<P>Though there are many Hollanders who live elegantly, the manners of the common people are extremely boori&s;h. Our author ob&s;erves, that he has &s;een a boatman in a great city, &s;trut up and down a room with his hat on, and &s;pit with a carele&s;s air of in|&s;olence at the feet of a gentleman who was treating him with civility, and throwing e|molument in his way. This behaviour they mi&s;take for liberty, as if liberty were incon|&s;i&s;tent with propriety of manner.</P>
<P>Chee&s;e, beer, Geneva, brandy, and to|bacco, with red herrings, are the luxuries of the common people, who in their cups are apt to mix ru&s;ticity with cruelty.</P>
<P>Con&s;tant employment, coldne&s;s of com|plexion, and an ungenial kind of food, may perhaps account for their indifference to the pa&s;&s;ion of love. Except among the higher ranks, female beauty is &s;carcely to be met with, nor does their dre&s;s &s;et off their home|ly per&s;ons to any advantage.</P>

<P>Mr. Hanway quitted Am&s;terdam on the 16th of October, and embarking at the Haerlem gate, proceeded down the canal in a treck&s;coot to that town, pa&s;&s;ing through a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of rich meadows well &s;tocked with cattle.</P>
<P>From Haerlem he proceeded to Leyden, through a plea&s;ant and rich country. This city is well known for its univer&s;ity, to which &s;tudents re&s;ort from all parts of Eu|rope. The hou&s;es are neat, and the &s;urround|ing gardens very plea&s;ant; but here the water becomes &s;tagnant, and in con&s;equence di&s;agreeable.</P>
<P>Our author next vi&s;ited the Hague, which having no inclo&s;ure, is denominated a vil|lage though it is the mo&s;t elegant place in the Netherlands. The &s;treets are broad, and the gaiety and &s;plendor of the inhabitants form a &s;triking contra&s;t to the &s;tyle of life in the trading cities. The a&s;&s;embly of the States General being held here, draws hi|ther all the principal people of di&s;tinction of the different provinces, and the amba&s;&s;adors from the other European courts. In &s;hort, the Hague is the &s;eat of amu&s;ement, of pa|rade,

and magnificence, in the United Pro|vinces</P>
<P>Delft, which was the next place our au|thor vi&s;ited, is a very ancient and plea&s;ant town, environed by meadows of con&s;iderable extent. This place is famous for its earthen ware, and its population, is computed at twenty thou&s;and per&s;ons.</P>
<P>Rotterdam, about &s;even miles di&s;tant, may ju&s;tly be con&s;idered as the &s;econd city of Holland. Indeed it has &s;everal advan|tages over Am&s;terdam it&s;elf, particularly with re&s;pect to the &s;outhern trade of Eu|rope: be&s;ides, the navigation of the Mae&s;e is more &s;afe and commodious than that of the Texel, and the air and water are better.</P>
<P>Among other public &s;tructures, is an ex|change for the merchants; but the mo&s;t re|markable edifice is the great church of St. Lawrence, in which are the monuments of &s;everal per&s;ons of di&s;tinction On the great bridge is the &s;tatue of the illu&s;trious Era&s;|mus.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h factory here is chiefly com|po&s;ed of North Britons, who have a Calvin|i&s;tic church. During the wars in Flanders, under the great Duke of Marlborough, an epi&s;copal church was erected by the contri|bution of the Engli&s;h officers, merchants, and mariners, which is &s;aid to be the only regular epi&s;copal church, countenanced and e&s;tabli&s;hed, belonging to the &s;ubjects of Great Britain, in a foreign country.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="035585_0110_100556C579773650">On the 27th of October, Mr. Hanway &s;ailed down the Mae&s;e to Helvoet Sluys. Though this is one of the be&s;t harbours in the United Provinces, the town is of no great extent. Here our traveller had the plea&s;ure to find a &s;mall &s;quadron of Briti&s;h &s;hips of war, under the command of Lord An&s;on, intended to convey George II. to England. The &s;ight of his country's &s;hips of war was the more agreeable, as he had not enjoyed &s;uch a view for the long &s;pace of eight years.</P>
<P>Embarking at this place next day in the packet for Harwich, he landed &s;afe on the Briti&s;h &s;hore, after a pa&s;&s;age of twenty-four hours, and thus clo&s;ed his exten&s;ive perigri|nations.</P>
