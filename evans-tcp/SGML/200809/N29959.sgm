<P>THIS Treati&s;e di&s;tributes the <HI>Whole Concern</HI> or <HI>Duty of a Chri&s;tian</HI> into the things which he ought to <HI>Know,</HI> and tho&s;e which he ought to <HI>Do.</HI> For the former are our Concern as well as the latter, be|cau&s;e our Chri&s;tianity con&s;i&s;ts in <HI>Principles</HI> as well as <HI>Practice</HI>: And therefore if we would approve our &s;elves to be complete Chri&s;tians, we mu&s;t take care of both the&s;e. In the Doctrinal part of this Book I have pre&s;ented the Reader with all the nece&s;&s;ary Truths of Chri&s;tianity, and in the Practical part I have &s;et down the peculiar &amp; proper Offices of All Per&s;ons of what rank or quality &s;oever, even of Rulers and Magi&s;trates. Nor have I omitted the Duty of Spiritual Governors, that is, Pa&s;tors and Teachers; for the Reader

might ju&s;tly think we are very Partial, when we pretend to a&s;&s;ign the <HI>Whole Concern of Man,</HI> and yet omit our <HI>Own</HI> Duty.</P>
<P>I have much Enlarged (beyond the pro|portion &amp; length which I have ob&s;erved in other Heads) on that of <HI>Parents</HI> and <HI>Children, Ma&s;ters</HI> &amp; <HI>Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of Fa|milies</HI> and their <HI>Charge,</HI> but let it not be accounted as a fault, for I intended this Book chiefly for Hou&s;holders and their Families, and therefore it was proper to <HI>In&s;i&s;t</HI> on tho&s;e Duties which more parti|cularly concern the&s;e.</P>
<P>So as to the <HI>Rea&s;ons</HI> &amp; <HI>Motives</HI> which I have u&s;ed to excite to the practice of the Duties Di&s;cour&s;ed of, I have more than ordinarily brought them forth when I had occa&s;ion to make my Application to Parents &amp; Heads of Families, not only becau&s;e <HI>the&s;e</HI> generally need them mo&s;t, but becau&s;e here they will have the <HI>greate&s;t</HI> Influence, and the <HI>large&s;t</HI> Effect, if they prove &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>I have added a particular Di&s;cour&s;e

concerning the nature of that <HI>Preparation</HI> which every Chri&s;tian ought to make for <HI>Death:</HI> which is a very u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary Subject, and therefore could not be omitted.</P>
<P>As to the wording and phra&s;ing of the whole, tho' I did not intend it &s;hould be &s;o Plain as that there &s;hould be nothing to entertain the Learned, yet I have calculated it chiefly for tho&s;e that are of ordinary under&s;tanding and low capacity, and accordingly I have u&s;ed a free &amp; facile way of Expre&s;&s;ion, as mo&s;t &s;uitable to that rank of Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Devotional</HI> Part, I have compo&s;ed it not only of Prayers to be u&s;ed in the Clo&s;et, but by the Family together, not being willing to be guilty of that Defect which is ob&s;ervable in the Book Entitled, <HI>The Whole Duty of Man,</HI> where there is not one Family-Prayer for Mornings or Evenings. To render this part of the Book as unexceptionable as I could, I have con&s;ulted and made &s;ome u&s;e of &s;everal <HI>Forms of Devotion</HI> publi&s;h'd by &s;ome of our mo&s;t Eminent Divines

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>A Preface to the en&s;uing Treati&s;e, &s;hewing the Nece&s;&s;ity of caring for the Soul.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">&sect;. 1. BEFORE I proceed to di&s;cour&s;e of the &s;everal Particulars of the <HI>Whole Concern of Man,</HI> it will be requi&s;ite in the fir&s;t place to <HI>prepare</HI> the Reader by convincing him of the <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity of the Care which be ought to have of his Soul.</HI> For unle&s;s he be throughly per&s;waded of this, he will never think him&s;elf concern'd in the Directions that I &s;hall lay down. We &s;ee daily that the greate&s;t Care of the generality of Men, is to ward off
<PB N="2" REF="039825_0009_10148C5ACA29C2C8">
dangers from their Bodies and E&s;tates, to guard and &s;ecure the&s;e by all means po&s;&s;ible from tho&s;e Evils which they are mo&s;t incident to; they very indu&s;triou&s;ly take care to prevent Sickne&s;s and Poverty, and to live in Health and Ea&s;e, and to grow Rich in the World: but in the mean time they neglect a far greater and weightier Concern, and wilfully pull down all manner of Evil and Mi&s;chief upon their Be&s;t and mo&s;t Con|&s;iderable Part, their <HI>Souls.</HI> But certainly they mu&s;t be reckon'd as very Unwi&s;e Per&s;ons who act after this rate, and indamage the&s;e latter to &s;ecure and &s;ave the former, namely, their Out|ward and Bodily Concerns. And on the contra|ry, this is the true&s;t Wi&s;dom, and the mo&s;t rational Love of our &s;elves, to prefer our Im|mortal <HI>Souls</HI> before all worldly intere&s;ts and ad|vantages what&s;oever. For a Mans <HI>Soul</HI> is his riche&s;t and mo&s;t precious Trea&s;ure: and the whole World is too mean a Price for it. This is the &s;en&s;e of our Infallible Ma&s;ter in tho&s;e Words of his, Matth. 16.26. <HI>What is a Man profiled if he &s;hall gain the whole World, and lo&s;e his own Soul? or what &s;hall a Man give in exchange for his Soul?</HI></P>
<P N="2">&sect;. 2. In which Admirable Pa&s;&s;age there is ob&s;ervable, Fir&s;t a double Suppo&s;ition, and Se|condly a double Po&s;ition or Conclu&s;ion grounded on tho&s;e Suppo&s;itions. The things &s;uppo&s;ed are, 1. That a Man may <HI>lo&s;e his Soul.</HI> 2. That with the lo&s;s of his <HI>Soul</HI> he may <HI>gain the whole World.</HI> For it is &s;aid, <HI>If he &s;hall gain the whole World and lo&s;e his own Soul.</HI> The Things that are po&s;itively a&s;&s;erted and infer'd from this two-fold
<PB N="3" REF="039825_0010_10148C958BF44D80">
Suppo&s;al are, 1. That the Man who gains the World and lo&s;es his Soul, receives no advan|tage or profit by &s;uch Gain. 2. That this wretched Man, having lo&s;t his Soul, cannot po&s;&s;ibly redeem and regain it, or give or take any thing in <HI>Ex|change</HI> for it.</P>
<P>So then, the&s;e four following Propo&s;itions com|prehend the full meaning of our Saviour's words. The Fir&s;t is this, that there are &s;ome Men, and tho&s;e too many in the World, who not only hazard but lo&s;e their Souls. The Second is, that it often happens that their gaining of the World is attended with this lo&s;s of their Souls. The Third is, that though Men gain the World, and yet lo&s;e their Immortal Souls, they are un&s;peaka|ble lo&s;ers by &s;uch a Bargain. The Fourth and la&s;t is, that there can be no Satisfaction or Re|compen&s;e made for the lo&s;s of a Mans Soul.</P>
<P N="3">&sect; 3. I begin with the Fir&s;t of the&s;e, namely, that there are &s;ome Men, and tho&s;e too many, who not only hazard but lo&s;e their Souls. Though this be a kind of <HI>Suppo&s;ition</HI> in the fore|mention'd words of our Saviour, yet it is a mo&s;t Po&s;itive Truth in it &s;elf. This is too &s;adly Ex|perienced, that the Sinner <HI>destroys his own Soul.</HI> Prov. 6.32. Not that the <HI>Soul</HI> of Man &s;hall cea&s;e to be,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mans Soul may be lo&s;t.</NOTE> nor that it &s;hall peri&s;h, and vani&s;h into no|thing: for it is an Immortal be|ing, and is not capable of being de&s;troy'd, with|out the Almighty Power of God who created it. But he hath plainly declared that it is his Will and Plea&s;ure that Souls &s;hall always exi&s;t, and remain either in Eernal Bli&s;s or Mi&s;ery.
<PB N="4" REF="039825_0011_10148C5F2B19C870">
By the <HI>lo&s;s of the Soul</HI> then we are not gro&s;ly to imagine any &s;uch thing as its being reduced to nothing: we cannot &s;o <HI>lo&s;e our Souls</HI> as that they &s;hall not continue to have a being. What is the meaning then of <HI>lo&s;ing the Soul?</HI></P>
<P>I An&s;wer, this may be learnt from the Origi|ginal Word, that is, the Word which the Evange|li&s;t here u&s;es; this &s;ignifies not only <HI>detriment</HI> or <HI>damage,</HI> but it denotes likewi&s;e <HI>privation</HI> or <HI>lo&s;s</HI>: and &s;o it may convey to us this double notion of the Souls being <HI>lo&s;t,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">As given up to Sin in this Life, and Mi|&s;ery in the next.</NOTE> namely Fir&s;t, in this Life, by the Damage it receives by Sin; Secondly, in the other Life, by the Deprivation of Glory, and exclu&s;ion from Eternal Hap|pine&s;s. There is a Temporary, and there is a Final Lo&s;s of the Soul: and it is only Sin or departing from God which procures this Perdi|tion. <HI>He that Converteth a Sinner &s;aveth a Soul,</HI> &s;aith St. <HI>James,</HI> ch. 5. <HI>ver.</HI> 20. Whence I gather, that if the Conver&s;ion of Sinners be the <HI>Saving</HI> of Souls; then by the Rule of Contraries, the <HI>Lo&s;ing</HI> of them is when they are Perverted and drawn away, Corrupted and Debauched by Lu&s;t and Vice, when they contract habits of Sin, and per&s;i&s;t in them, and Revolt from their Ma|ker and Redeemer, and are &s;hut out from Com|munion with God, and incur his wrath and di&s;|plea&s;ure. Then they are properly &s;aid to be <HI>lo&s;t.</HI></P>
<P N="4">&sect;. 4. So they are &s;aid to be more &s;ignally when this di&s;plea&s;ure follows them into the other World, and places them in the forlorn Condition
<PB N="5" REF="039825_0012_10148C986705BF00">
of the Damned Spirits of Darkne&s;s. Then they are irrecoverably lo&s;t in Hell, and Mercy it &s;elf cannot retrieve them, for they are ab&s;olutely de|prived of God's Favour, debar'd of his pre&s;ence, &s;hut out from it as Reprobates and Ca&s;taways, and irrever&s;ibly de&s;tined to endle&s;s Torments. Hence our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tran&s;lators have thus rendred that paralel Place in St. <HI>Luke,</HI> in Chapter 9. ver. 25. <HI>What is a Man advantaged if he &s;hall gain the whole World, and lo&s;e him&s;elf, or be ca&s;t away?</HI> Whereby they would let us under|&s;tand, that then a Man may properly be &s;aid to <HI>lo&s;e him&s;elf</HI> or his <HI>Soul,</HI> when he is <HI>ca&s;t away</HI>; that is, ca&s;t out of God's favour, which alone can create Ea&s;e and happine&s;s; when he is Fi|nally rejected by the Almighty, and utterly de|nied all tenders of Grace and Mercy. Whereup|on mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily follow a mo&s;t dreadful Horror and di&s;traction of Mind, and the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Pain and Torture: &s;uch as no thoughts can &s;uf|ficiently conceive, no Tongue is able to expre&s;s; for in this the Torments of Hell, and the Joys of Heaven re&s;emble one another, that they are both Unutterable. It is impo&s;&s;ible to tell you fully what the Damned lo&s;e, and what they &s;uffer; what they are deprived of, and what they feel.</P>
<P N="5">&sect;. 5. Let us, before we pa&s;s to the next Par|ticular, &s;tand a while and &s;eriou&s;ly lament and be|wail the forlorn &s;tate of <HI>lo&s;t Souls.</HI> I have gi|ven you a brief repre&s;entation of it; and now let us ask our &s;elves what can we imagine more &s;ad and dreadful? It would be well for the Sinner, if he could <HI>lo&s;e his Soul</HI> in the Sen&s;e which I fir&s;t of all mention'd, that is, if he could &s;lide into
<PB N="6" REF="039825_0013_10148C60B03650D0">
nothing, and for ever cea&s;e to be. But the will not be granted him: for he mu&s;t remained La&s;t|ing Monument of the divine di&s;plea&s;ure. This is the heighth of his Mi&s;ery, that he &s;hall have a Never-failing Exi&s;tence, and his portion &s;hall be in that <HI>Lake</HI> which Perpetually <HI>burns with Fire and Brimstone, where the Worm dieth not, and the Fire is not quenched.</HI> This the Holy and Infallible Book of God acquaints us with: and yet how Great are the Numbers of Men in the World, who throw them&s;elves into the&s;e Flames, and wilfully plunge them&s;elves into that horrible Lake, who not only <HI>Hazard</HI> but <HI>Lo&s;e</HI> their Souls? <HI>Broad is the gate that leads to De&s;truction, and Many there are that go in thereat,</HI> and &s;o are Everla&s;tingly excluded from all hopes of Life and Salvation. The&s;e Mi&s;erable &amp; be&s;otted Wretch|es, though perhaps they &s;ufficiently under&s;tood their Duty, yet wilfully neglected the practice of it. They ru&s;h'd into danger, &amp; &s;eem'd to court Death &amp; De&s;truction, neither minding the dread|ful Judgments of God, nor being affected with the Kindne&s;s &amp; Obligations they daily received from him. They cared not how they were to fare hereafter, &s;o they might be Permitted to Gratify and Indulge their de&s;ires here. They were no ways &s;ollicitous for the Future, but it was their Pre&s;ent Advantage only that they bu&s;ied them&s;elves about. And in this oftentimes they are thriving and &s;ucce&s;sful enough, but yet &s;o as that they but the <HI>World</HI> with the Price of their <HI>Souls.</HI></P>
<P N="6">&sect;. 6. Which brings me to the <HI>Second</HI> Pro+po&s;ition, which is this, that too often it happen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that Mens gaining the World is accompanied wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="7" REF="039825_0014_10148C9CC1541680">
the lo&s;s of their Souls. Whil&s;t they purcha&s;e Earth, they lo&s;e Heaven: they gra&s;p at things Temporal, and let go tho&s;e that are Eternal. Or, <HI>to gain the whole World,</HI> in the fulle&s;t mean|ing of our Saviour's Words is this, To climb as high in the World as a Mans Avarice or Ambi|tion can carry him, to immer&s;e him&s;elf as deep as he can in the delights of Sen&s;e, to attain to as ample a fruition of Earthly Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions as is po&s;&s;i|ble, to live in &s;plendor and gallantry, to be Great and Powerful, to be Rich and Wealthy, to enjoy the affluence of all &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ures, and to have what heart can wi&s;h. And now I believe you perceive already, that we are in a fair way to prove the Propo&s;ition: for whil&s;t the unbridled appe|tites of Men are let loo&s;e to the enjoyment of all they de&s;ire and covet after, it is no wonder that their <HI>Immortal Souls</HI> are hazarded. The Con|nection of the Parts in this clau&s;e of our Saviours Words, is no uncommon thing in the ob&s;ervation of all Intelligent Per&s;ons. The <HI>Gain</HI> of the <HI>World</HI> is joyn'd with the <HI>lo&s;s</HI> of the <HI>Soul.</HI> The frequent Examples of Mankind do too evidently evince, that Wealth and Worldly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions are held without Vertue and real Goodne&s;s; nay, that the&s;e are too often made in&s;trumental to the greate&s;t Vices: they u&s;ually promote in Mens minds Lu&s;t and Pride, forgetfulne&s;s of God, and a hatred of Goodne&s;s, a Prophane and Athei&s;ti|cal Spirit, and an utter di&s;regard of another Life.</P>
<P N="7">&sect;. 7. Would you know (or rather be re|minded of) the <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> of this? It is no other then this, that it is hard to gain the World, and
<PB N="8" REF="039825_0015_10148C638190CD78">
not let our Hearts upon it: and hence it is, that our never-dying Souls.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The immode|rate gain of the World en|dangers the lo&s;s of the Soul.</NOTE> are in|dangered by the acqui&s;ition of the&s;e Temporal and Tran&s;itory Goods. You read of the <HI>De|ceitfulne&s;s of Riches, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.</HI> 13.22. This Cheat, this Delu&s;ion is too apparent in the World, and the &s;ad effects of it redo and to the depraving and corrupting our Better Part. What do not the Immoderate care and Sollicitude about this World betray men to? What do not this Inor|dinate Love and Delight invite Men to, and even thru&s;t them upon? &s;o true is that of the Wi&s;e Man, [<HI>He that maketh ha&s;ts to be Rich, &s;hall not be Innocent.</HI>] Prov. 28.20. Which Words plain|ly import more than they expre&s;s; for the per|&s;on he &s;peaks of, is &s;o far from being <HI>Innocent</HI> that he unavoidably involves him&s;elf in the great|e&s;t <HI>Guilt,</HI> and runs into the wor&s;t of di&s;orders and mi&s;demeanors. Thus the Traytor <HI>Judas</HI> was betray'd (if I may &s;o &s;ay) into that Execra|ble Villany of Selling his Ma&s;ter by his Coveting the 30 Pieces of Silver. The true cau&s;e of <HI>De|mas</HI>'s for&s;aking St. <HI>Paul,</HI> and Apo&s;tatizing from his Chri&s;tian cour&s;e, was his <HI>loving of this pre|&s;ent World.</HI> 2 Tim. 4.10. This <HI>deceitfulne&s;s</HI> of <HI>Mammon</HI> might be Demon&s;trated in Innume|rable other In&s;tances, which I now forbear.</P>
<P N="8">&sect;. 8. I could Evidence to you likewi&s;e, that it not only Cheats Men of their Faith &amp; Religi|on, but of Heaven and Eternal Happine&s;s, which indeed nece&s;&s;arily follows on the other. There are Two Notable Parables left us by our Saviour,
<PB N="9" REF="039825_0016_10148C9E4552B778">
to put us in Mind of this. The Fir&s;t is of the <HI>Rich Man,</HI> Luke. 12.16. Who Built larger Barns and Granaries to Lodge his Stores and Provi&s;ions in, and then Sung this <HI>Requiem</HI> to his Soul, [<HI>Thou hast much Goods lay'd up for many Years, Eat, Drink, and be merry.</HI>] But mark what was &s;aid unto him by God, [<HI>Thou Fool, this Night thy Soul &s;hall be required of thee.</HI>] The Lo&s;s of his <HI>Soul,</HI> yea and the Eternal Perdition of it, was the Lamentable clo&s;e of all his Gains. The Reading or Hearing of this, &s;hould &s;tartle the Wealthie&s;t Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of this Worlds Goods, and remind them to &s;ecure their Intere&s;t <HI>Above,</HI> that when their Earthly Mammon fails, they may be receiv'd into <HI>Everla&s;ting Habitations.</HI> They have need of Repeating Our Church's Litany, <HI>In all time of our Wealth, Good Lord deliver us.</HI> They have Rea&s;on to Pray, and that mo&s;t heartily, that they may not be &s;o bu&s;y in Gaining the Riches of this World, as thereby to hazard their welfare in ano|ther.</P>
<P>The Other Parable is of the <HI>Wealthy Glutton, who Fared Deliciou&s;ly every Day,</HI> Luke. 16.19. But in the 23. ver. You find him <HI>in Hell, lifting up his Eyes, being in Torments,</HI> beholding that Happine&s;s which he could not come at, and Beg|ging for that Refre&s;hment which he was never like to obtain. And what was the Rea&s;on? Name|ly, becau&s;e he had wilfully Excluded him&s;elf by his Voluptuous and Luxurious Living, by Immode|rately Glutting him&s;elf with the Delights of this Life, and never thinking of another. The&s;e are very Lively Repre&s;entations and Convictions of the Truth of what we have been treating of.

Therefore let us make this Excellant U&s;e of it, to be exceeding Careful and Watchful through our whole Lives, that we be not Deceived and In&s;na|red by the Things of this World, that we &s;uffer not our Minds to be Debauched by the enjoyment of them, that (as the Apo&s;tle advi&s;eth) <HI>we u&s;e this World as not abu&s;ing it,</HI> le&s;t we be of the num|ber of tho&s;e whom our Saviour &s;peaks of, who <HI>Gain the World,</HI> but <HI>Lo&s;e their Souls</HI> into the Bargain.</P>

its Delights, and we cannot be deceiv'd: and therefore we conclude, that this <HI>World</HI> hath more worth in it then you imagine: and you vainly in|deavour to beat down the Price of it. And then as for the <HI>Soul,</HI> we cannot &s;ay &s;uch great things of that. Yea, many di&s;pute and wrangle about it's Nature and Properties, and certain it is, that no Nan ever &s;aw it.

And in a Word, the Souls of Men were made after the I|mage of God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Image of God</NOTE> they are Copies of
<PB N="12" REF="039825_0019_10148C69523BC920">
that Excellent and Divine Original. Thus hu|mane Souls in their own Nature are of great Worth &amp; Excellency.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Price of your Redemption.</NOTE> Again, we cannot but be con|vinc'd, that they are &s;o from the Con&s;ideration of the Great Price which was Pay'd for them. God thought Mens Souls worth the expen&s;e of the Blood of his only Begotten Son. This &s;hews how highly they were valued by God the Father, and Chri&s;t Je&s;us the Merciful Redee|mer of them. This &s;hews that they are in them|&s;elves Precious, and that they are in the Sight of God of great Price.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Attempts of the Enemy.</NOTE> Likewi&s;e, from the eager and bu&s;y endea|vours of the Evil Spirit, to pre|vert &amp; &s;educe them, we may In|fer the great &amp; ine&s;timable worth of them. He is re&s;tle&s;s in his Attempts to make a Prey of us, becau&s;e we carry within us &s;o Great &amp; Rich a Trea|&s;ure: this makes it worth his pains &amp; utmo&s;t care, to Spoil and Rob us. So that the Indefatigable A&s;&s;aults of this our Malicious &amp; Cunning Adver|&s;ary, are an Argument of the Extraordinary Worth and Excellency of our Souls.</P>
<P>But then for the <HI>World,</HI> weigh it in the bal|lance, and it will be found Light and Worthle&s;s.

But the mo&s;t palpable di&s;paragement and blemi&s;h, of all the things that this World affords, may be comprehended in the&s;e Two Things, Fir&s;t, They cannot allay or mitigate the Stings of a wounded Con&s;cience: they cannot avail us when God withdraws the light of his Counte|nance, when he writes bitter things again&s;t us, and di&s;covers his wrath &amp; di&s;plea&s;ure for our Sins.

They are Phy&s;icians of no value, becau&s;e they cannot Cure and Heal our Inward di&s;tem|pers: but they rather &s;erve to Increa&s;e them. And Secondly, more particularly, the <HI>World</HI> can|not &s;peak Peace to a Man when he is to leave it, and to go out of it, and con&s;equently, it cannot be of any great value and worth, for all its worth extends no further then this Life, which is &s;hort and &s;oon ended.

rationally conclude, that it is a very Mean and Sorry thing; and hence al&s;o it followeth, that a Man is not in the lea&s;t Profited, if he &s;hall Gain the World by the Lo&s;s of his Soul.</P>
<P N="13">&sect;. 13. I might further prove this Propo&s;iti|on by the next, as thus; That the man who lo&s;es his Soul, though with the Acce&s;&s;ion of Worldly Gain, is an un&s;peakable Lo&s;er, may be made good by the <HI>Fourth</HI> and La&s;t Propo&s;ition, which is yet behind, which you may remember was to this effect, That there can be no Satisfaction or Re|compence given for the lo&s;s of a Mans Soul: or, as 'tis here expre&s;s'd, there is no Exchange. The Greek Word hath reference to <HI>Contracts</HI> &amp; <HI>Bar|gains</HI> about <HI>Buying</HI> &amp; <HI>Selling,</HI> which of Old were made not by Paying or Receiving of Money, but by Bartering or <HI>Exchanging.</HI> Whence the word is here made u&s;e of by our Saviour, to let us know, that there is no <HI>Traficking</HI> for Lo&s;t and Damned Souls, there is no <HI>Buying</HI> of them again, when they are finally Sold and Lo&s;t. And more particularly, the word is u&s;ed in Good Authors to &s;ignify the <HI>Price of Redemption,</HI> and &s;o it may very fitly be applyed here: and then this impor|tant Truth is convey'd to us, that after this Life there is an utter Impo&s;&s;ibility of Redeeming a lo&s;t Soul. If the Sinner be once taken Captive by Satan, and bound in the Chains of Darkne&s;s, there is no hope of Redemption, there is no Counter-Price to be laid down and paid, to buy him back again. <HI>What &s;hall a Man give in Exchange for his Soul?</HI></P>

<P N="15">&sect; 15. And this will appear to be a Propo|&s;ition too &s;adly true if we con&s;ider this one thing, that there is no Proportion at all, between the thing lo&s;t and that which is offered in Exchange or Compen&s;ation. The whole World affords nothing that can <HI>An&s;wer</HI> the Lo&s;s of a Soul; for (as I have briefly demon&s;trated to you) all the World in re&s;pect of the Immortal Spirit of Man is Mean and Incon&s;iderable. There is no Com|pari&s;on at all between the&s;e Two: therefore the Gain of the whole World will not countervail the lo&s;s of one Soul. And this al&s;o is to be con|&s;ider'd, that there is an Irrever&s;ible Sentence pa&s;t upon the Wicked as &s;oon as they leave this World, and therefore there can be no Satisfaction or Ex|change made for them. When once the Fatal Doom is pronounced by the Judge, there is no po&s;&s;ibility of Evading it.</P>

<PB N="17" REF="039825_0024_10148CA8D0148808">
of their Prie&s;ts is the only fuel which main|tains that Fire. A con&s;tant Revenue comes into them from the <HI>Dirges</HI> and <HI>Ma&s;&s;es</HI> for the dead, in hope of a Relea&s;e out of tho&s;e Flames. Thus this, and many other Popi&s;h doctrines are founded on their Secular Profit. They make their Gain their Godline&s;s. To <HI>Gain the World</HI> they pretend to re&s;cue <HI>Souls</HI> out of the Infernal Pri&s;on; whil&s;t in the mean time by their fal&s;hoods and delu&s;ions they palbably endanger the Salvation of men, and put them into the direct way of Lo&s;ing their Souls. But what can be more Plain and Peremp|tory than that of the Royal Preacher, in <HI>Eccl.</HI> 9.10. [<HI>What&s;oever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might, for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge in the grave whither thou goest?</HI>] As much as to &s;ay, the working out of our Salva|tion, is the proper and only employment of this Life, and after it there is no Redre&s;s. Whence it follows that the Lo&s;s of Souls is not to be Re|ver&s;ed in another World, and con&s;equently that it is &s;uch a Lo&s;s as is Ine&s;timable &amp; Irrecoverable. [<HI>For what is a man profited if he &s;hall gain the whole world, and lo&s;e his own Soul? or what &s;hall a man give in Exchange for his Soul.</HI></P>
<P N="16">&sect;. 16. Thus I have di&s;tinctly con&s;idered the &s;everal branches of our Saviours words, with the Propo&s;itions that they afford. And I have done it with this de&s;ign, that we might thence be convin|ced of the Grand thing I propounded, namely, <HI>the Nece&s;&s;ity of taking care for our Souls,</HI> and that above and before all other things what&s;oever. This is the proper Inference from <HI>every</HI> one of tho&s;e Particulars that I have in&s;i&s;ted upon: which I will
<PB N="18" REF="039825_0025_10148C6EF5EF0990">
thus briefly make good. Fir&s;t, If the Lo&s;s of the Soul be no unu&s;ual thing, then it highly concerns us to take Care, that we be not of the number of tho&s;e unhappy per&s;ons who lo&s;e their Souls. Secondly, If the Gain of the World contributes to this Lo&s;s, then we are obliged to be very cau|tious and circum&s;pect, in the u&s;e of the enjoy|ments of this World: which we cannot be, unle&s;s we have a great Care of our Souls, unle&s;s we watch over them with much diligence, and take &s;ome pains about the regulating &amp; well ordering of them. E&s;pecially, if we con&s;ider, Thirdly, that all the Worldly Gain &amp; Advantage we can expect to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of by our &s;inful and vitious behaviour, will be of no real Profit to us, this will further en|gage us to mind the welfare of our Souls, and to &s;ecure that, whatever el&s;e we fail in. And then la&s;tly, if we con&s;ider that the Lo&s;s of our Souls is of that nature that no Exchange or Recompen&s;e can be made for it, we are yet more &s;trongly ob|liged to the duty I have &s;o often mentioned. If we lo&s;e our Souls, it is impo&s;&s;ible to recover them: If by our wilful neglect we forfeit our Salvation, there is no way left to regain it.</P>
<P N="17">&sect; 17. Wherefore let us be exhorted to value our Immortal Souls above all things el&s;e, and to think nothing too difficult to do, or too dear to part with for the en&s;uring and &s;aving of the&s;e. As for our <HI>Bodies,</HI> the worth of them is, that they are the receptacles of our <HI>Souls.</HI> The&s;e are the Jewels, the others are but the Ca&s;ket. And as for the World, and all things in it, they are not only vain and empty, and unable to &s;atisfy the ra|tional mind of man, but they are wont to mold
<PB N="19" REF="039825_0026_10148CAB5DB54920">
and di&s;turb it, and to divert it from attending to the &s;erious concerns of another World. There|fore that we may in good earne&s;t mind the Inte|re&s;t of our Souls, we mu&s;t be careful not to bu&s;y our &s;elves too much with worldly affairs, we mu&s;t not &s;et our hearts on Earthly profits &amp; plea&s;ures. My meaning is not that we &s;hould &s;light &amp; di&s;|regard our Bodies and our temporal concerns. We may lawfully look after the&s;e, we have free leave to mind our &s;ecular bu&s;ine&s;s in a moderate and due manner, and &s;o far as Chri&s;tian Di&s;creti|on requires of us. But that which I urge is this, that we &s;hould not &s;o attend on our Earthly em|ployments as to forget Heaven, that we &s;hould not be &s;o &s;ollicitous about our bodily affairs, as to neglect the things which are Spiritual, accord|ing to the Apo&s;tle's complaint, <HI>that all &s;eek their own, not the things which are Je&s;us Chri&s;t's,</HI> Phil. 2.21.</P>
<P>But we ought to li&s;ten to our Ble&s;&s;ed Ma&s;ter's Advice, <HI>Mat.</HI> 6.33. <HI>Seek ye fir&s;t the King|dom of God, and his righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI>; that is, mind Religion and your Souls in the Fir&s;t place, &amp; then be not neglectful of your temporal Intere&s;t, &amp; the things which conduce to the advantage of your bodies and outward man. Know this, that your Eternal Salvation is the main thing you are to mind: you are to prefer your Spiritual advantage before all worldly and temporal con&s;iderations. For your <HI>Souls</HI> are more con&s;iderable than the <HI>whole World,</HI> and therefore the &s;ecuring of them is a matter of the greate&s;t moment, and of the highe&s;t concern.

<P>Let me Ob&s;erve to you the Dependance of tho&s;e words in the fir&s;t and &s;econd ver&s;es of the 4th Chapter of <HI>Ho&s;ea.</HI> The Complaint at that time was, <HI>that there was no Knowledge of God in the Land:</HI> Whereupon it immediately follows that <HI>by Swearing, and Lying, &amp; Killing, &amp; Steal|ing, and committing Adultery, they brake out, and blood touched blood.</HI> Ignorance of God hath the&s;e woful Con&s;equences, the&s;e di&s;mal ef|fects. He that knows not God, and is not in|&s;tructed in his duty, will be tempted to commit all manner of wickedne&s;s and impiety. If we look into the Body of Man, we &s;hall find that there is a near conjunction between the Head and all the Members that are de&s;igned for action and motion: the Brain, the Seat of Under&s;tanding, con&s;tantly &s;ends forth Spirits through all the Nerves into the whole fabrick of the body, in or|der to &s;en&s;e and action. This may repre&s;ent or &s;hadow out to us an higher Notion, namely, the near Tye and Union, the con&s;tant commerce and corre&s;pondence between <HI>Knowledge</HI> &amp; <HI>Practice,</HI> between the Under&s;tanding &amp; the Conver&s;ation.

</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">&sect;. 1. THE fir&s;t Fundamental and nece&s;&s;ary Principle of Knowledge is, that there is a God. This is the foundation &amp; ground|work of all: And the &s;everal in&s;uing Particulars mu&s;t be built on this bottom. The Author to the <HI>Hebrews</HI> makes this the fir&s;t and lowe&s;t &s;tep of our Knowledge and Belief, <HI>Heb.</HI> 11.6. <HI>He that cometh unto God</HI> (that is, in any way of Re|ligious Wor&s;hip) <HI>mu&s;t believe that he is.</HI> It is requi&s;ite that he lay his foundation in the Know|ledge and Belief of a God. And here indeed Na|tural, as well as Revealed Religion, directs us; for the Pagan World arrived thus far, namely, to acknowledge a Supreme Being, who was before all things, and is exalted above all, &amp; is the Go|vernour and Di&s;po&s;er of all. They had &s;ome no|tice of a Being that was the Author of all other Beings &amp; is Infinite and Eternal, &amp; void of all Imperfections what&s;oever. This is <HI>God,</HI> &amp; the truth &amp; reality of &s;uch a Being are proved from that general Impre&s;s &amp; univer&s;al Stamp of a Deity which are on Mens Minds.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Being of God a Dictate of Nature.</NOTE> All of us, as we we are Men and Rational Creatures, have this Notion naturally implanted in our Under&s;tandings, that there is a Sovereign Being that made us, &amp; upholds us, and is continually &s;hewing kindne&s;s to us, and is in him&s;elf infinitely good and perfect. We bring this Sentiment into the World with us, &amp; it is
<PB N="38" REF="039825_0045_10146B1E1E406E38">
&s;o fa&s;t riveted into our Minds, that we cannot &s;hake it off and be rid of it, though we would. Now, this being a per&s;wa&s;ion fixed in all Man|kind, it follows, that it is a very Rea&s;onable Dictate: And the voice of Nature here is to be interpreted as the Voice of God. All agree una|nimou&s;ly in this Acknowledgment, &amp; there are no Di&s;&s;enters in this Point, unle&s;s they be tho&s;e who&s;e Brains are di&s;turbed &amp; &s;hattered, or tho&s;e who being addicted to their Lu&s;ts and Vices, di&s;|cour&s;e again&s;t a Deity, becau&s;e they would not have one to puni&s;h them for their mi&s;demeanours. Excepting the&s;e Men, the univer&s;al &s;uffrage of Mankind is, that there is a God.</P>
<P N="2">&sect;. 2. Again the Knowledge of a God, that is, of his real Exi&s;tence is proved not only from the natural In&s;tinct of every Man's Mind, but al&s;o from tho&s;e occa&s;ional Reflections which Men are wont to make upon them&s;elves &amp; their Actions. How frequently do their Con&s;ciences tell them that they have done ami&s;s? And they pronounce them&s;elves guilty, &amp; fear &amp; dread po&s;&s;e&s;s their Minds. Now I pray tell me whence doth this proceed? Why are they afraid, &amp; find a di&s;order in them&s;elves? Is it not becau&s;e they have of|fended &s;ome Being or Per&s;on who knoweth what they have done, and who will call them to an Account, and will puni&s;h them for their mi&s;car|riages?<NOTE PLACE="marg">Proved from con&s;cience of guilt.</NOTE> Who is this but <HI>God?</HI> It is their con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his taking notice of their faults that di&s;com|po&s;eth them: And we read that the greate&s;t Tyrants and mo&s;t do|mineering Per&s;ecutors, who have defied and out-braved all Mankind, yet were not able to &s;tifle
<PB N="39" REF="039825_0046_10148CC5C50BD308">
their Fears which they had in their Brea&s;ts of a God. The apprehen&s;ion of this hath made them quake and tremble, and amid&s;t all their Plea&s;ures and Luxuries, they could by no means divert the torments of their own Con&s;ciences. The&s;e cried aloud to them that there was a God, a God who would &s;everely animadvert upon their wicked Actions. Thus there are inward Evidences from Mens Souls and Con&s;ciences, which are undeniable proofs of a Godhead.</P>
<P N="3">&sect;. 3. But be&s;ides the&s;e inward proofs, there are the&s;e likewi&s;e which are outward and vi&s;ible. Open your Eyes, look abroad, and you cannot but behold a God in the Frame and Fabrick of the World,<NOTE PLACE="marg">From the vi&s;i|ble Frame of things.</NOTE> in the upper and lower Rooms of this great Hou&s;e, and in all the Gue&s;ts &amp; Inhabitants of it. View and con&s;ider the&s;e di&s;tinctly, and you will confe&s;s them to be no le&s;s than a demon&s;tration of a Dei|ty. The exi&s;tence of a Creator appears unto us by his Creatures. We may know the great Ar|tificer of the World by the Works of his Hands, and that as certainly as we can gather from the &s;ight of a complete and exact Watch, that the Spring and the Wheels, and all the other parts of it, and the whole orderly motion of it, are not by chance, but are the product of &s;ome skilful Workman and Arti&s;t: Nay, we may gather this <HI>more</HI> certainly; for if &s;uch a piece of Workman|&s;hip as a Watch, which mu&s;t be wound up at a certain time, or el&s;e its Motion will fail, and the finene&s;s and exactne&s;s of all its parts will &s;ignifie nothing, (I &s;ay) this Workman&s;hip be not thought by any &s;ober Man to be ca&s;ual, or to be from its

&s;elf, then much le&s;s can we imagine the Fabrick of the World to be of that nature, when we &s;ee that after &s;ome thou&s;ands of years it needs no winding up, no renewing, repairing, or recruit|ing, but continues entire and perfect, as at fir&s;t, and is moved and acted in the &s;ame way, cour&s;e and method that it ever was. This &s;hews its Almighty Author, &amp; All wi&s;e Maker, &s;o that we have rea&s;on to e&s;tabli&s;h our &s;elves in the be|lief of a God from the con&s;ideration of the Ma|ker of the World, &amp; all things in it. <HI>His eter|nal Power &amp; Godhead are clearly &s;een &amp; un|der&s;tood by the things that are made,</HI> Rom. 1. 20. And more particularly &amp; &s;ignally <HI>the Hea|vens declare the glory of God, &amp; the Firma|ment &s;heweth his handy work,</HI> P&s;al. 19.1. And his glorious Power, Maje&s;ty, Wi&s;dom &amp; Good|ne&s;s, are beheld <HI>every where</HI> in the Works which we &s;ee in the World. Where&s;oever you look, he is before your Eyes, he may be taken notice of in every Creature. Therefore we may, if we plea&s;e, be &s;o favourable in our Cen&s;ures as to imagine, that that excellent Natural Philo&s;opher, who in the beginning of his <HI>Natural Hi&s;tory</HI> a&s;&s;erts the <HI>World</HI> to be <HI>God,</HI> meant no more than this, that God is to be di&s;covered in all the parts of this wonderful compo&s;ure of the World, &amp; particularly in the Frame of our Bodies. Thus God <HI>is not far from every one of us,</HI> &amp; <HI>in him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> live, &amp; move, and have our being.</HI> The Works of the Creation a|lone are an undeniable proof of a Deity. You mu&s;t needs acknowledge a God when you take a &s;urvey of the Heavens &amp; of the Earth, &amp; of the excellent Furniture belonging to them, e&s;pecially if you &s;urvey your &s;elves, &amp; con&s;ider the make

both of your Souls &amp; Bodies, the excellent Work|man&s;hip whereof is a pregnant confutation of Athei&s;m. It is utterly impo&s;&s;ible that the&s;e things &s;hould make them&s;elves, &amp; that they &s;hould &s;ub|&s;i&s;t in that wonderful manner in which they ap|pear, without a Divine Contriver and Author.</P>
<P N="4">&sect; 4. And here, to render this Argument yet &s;tronger &amp; more forcible, we are to ob&s;erve and remember, that all the Works we contemplate in the World &s;hew <HI>De&s;ign</HI> &amp; <HI>Intention</HI> in the mak|ing of them, &amp; therefore are not the Works of Chance, but the re&s;ult of an infinite Wi&s;dom. Behold the greater World, the whole Structure of the Heavenly &amp; Earthly Bodies; &amp; look into the le&s;&s;er World, your &s;elves, &amp; you will find, that there is an excellent <HI>Harmony</HI> &amp; <HI>Connexion</HI> of all things, you will perceive that one thing was made and fitted for another, and that there are certain <HI>Ends</HI> and <HI>Purpo&s;es</HI> to which they tend, and for which they were contrived. So that from the contemplation of the Works that are before us, we cannot but infer an All-wi&s;e Ar|chitect and Di&s;po&s;er.</P>
<P N="5">&sect;. 5. There are &s;everal other Arguments to prove the <HI>Divinity,</HI> as the many <HI>Revelations</HI> God hath made of him&s;elf to the Patriarchs and holy Men in the Old Te&s;tament, &amp; to the Apo&s;|tles and others in the New: the <HI>foretelling of future Events</HI> many hundreds of Years before they came to pa&s;s: The &s;trange and wonderful <HI>Pre&s;ervation of the Church</HI> in all Ages: The remarkable <HI>Puni&s;hing</HI> of notorious Offenders, &s;o that <HI>the Lord is known by the Judgments which he executeth,</HI> P&s;al. 9.16. And la&s;tly, the &s;ingu|lar <HI>Rewarding</HI> and <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing</HI> of &s;ome religious

<P>Wherefore let us firmly imbrace this leading Principle, which is the Source and Root of all the re&s;t, and the very prop and &s;upport of Religion; for he that acknowledgeth not that there is a God, cannot wor&s;hip or obey him. Let us be well grounded in this fir&s;t and fundamental Point con|cerning the Being of God: Let us have a &s;olid and rightly &s;ettled per&s;wa&s;ion of it, founded on tho&s;e clear and convictive Arguments before al|ledged.</P>
<P N="6">&sect;. 6. II. As we are to know there is a God, &s;o we mu&s;t know that he is but One, and that there is no other God but He. This Principle mu&s;t be &s;ettled in us in contradi&s;tinction to the plurality of Gods which the Pagans vainly ima|gined. We mu&s;t acquaint our &s;elves, that it is a very gro&s;s &amp; ab&s;urd thing to con|ceive,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Unity of God.</NOTE> that there are more Gods than One. This delu&s;ion is fre|quently &s;truck at in the Sacred Law given by <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and the oppo&s;ite Truth is there very often inculcated. This is the Fir&s;t thing which is pre&s;ented to us in that Body of Precepts, which we call the <HI>Ten Commandments, Thou &s;halt have no other God but me.</HI> This is urged as a nece&s;&s;ary Principle of <HI>Knowledge, Deut.</HI> 4.35. <HI>That thou mighte&s;t know that the Lord he is God, and there is none el&s;e be&s;ides him.</HI> Again, in the 39th Ver&s;e of the the &s;ame Chap|ter, this is commended as a Principle which ought to be known and con&s;idered. <HI>Know therefore

And you may ob&s;erve, that it is mention'd in that place al&s;o as a <HI>Principle of Knowledge: We know that an Idol is nothing in the World,</HI> (that is, though it be counted &s;ome|thing, nay a very Deity, by the ignorant and ido|latrous Gentiles, yet it is no &s;uch thing really): <HI>We know this,</HI> &s;aith the Apo&s;tle, &amp; <HI>we know that there is no other God but one: For though there be that are called Gods (as there be Gods many and Lords many) yet to us there is but one God.</HI> An&s;werable to which is that which the &s;ame A|po&s;tle &s;aith in <HI>Eph.</HI> 4.5. <HI>There is one Lord</HI>: And Ver&s;e the 6th, <HI>There is one God &amp; Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all</HI>; which is an excellent de&s;cription and portraiture of that One True God.</P>
<P N="7">&sect;. 7. The Philo&s;ophers and &s;ober Men among the Gentiles, when they had a mind to &s;peak &s;e|riou&s;ly, &amp; to be under&s;tood &s;o, a&s;&s;erted that there was but One God: And truly they might arrive to this by the very light of Nature; for the very Notion of a God, that is, of an infinitely and tran&s;cendently Good, Wi&s;e, and powerful Being, includes this in it, that there cannot be more Gods than one. For what is Infinitely Perfect can be but One, becau&s;e that which is mo&s;t perfect ex|ceeds and &s;urpa&s;&s;es all others, and con&s;equently there cannot be any other of that tran&s;cendent Nature: It is impo&s;&s;ible there &s;hould be any more than One of that Rank.

<P N="8">&sect;. 8. I might add here al&s;o, that the know|ledge of this Principle is nece&s;&s;ary in order to the fixing and rectifying of our Devotion. For the knowledge of one God is the foundation of all our Addre&s;&s;es to him, it is the true Ba&s;is of our Ser|vice and Wor&s;hip: For the&s;e Exerci&s;es of Religi|on ari&s;e from the excellency and tran&s;cendency of that One Being above all others.

And becau&s;e the &s;ame infallible Scripture a&s;&s;ures us that there is but one God; we gather this like|wi&s;e that the&s;e Three are One; and we not only gather it, but it is expre&s;&s;ed in plain terms.

For although he is plea&s;ed to let &s;ome great Of|fenders per&s;i&s;t in their gro&s;s Impieties, and not cut them off in the Career of their Sins, yet this is no argument of Impunity: For who knows what La&s;hes &amp; Torments they feel in their Brea&s;ts?

He who might de&s;erved|ly pour down the Vials of his Wrath upon our Heads, he who might utterly de&s;troy us as &s;oon as we offend, yet is plea&s;ed to let us experience his patience and long-&s;uffering, and vouch&s;afeth to bear with our Follies, and by his forbearance de&s;igns to win us to repentance and amendment of life.

From the whole Series of the Apo&s;tle's words in that place, it is clear, that we are all Criminals even by Birth, we inherit Death and Sin from the fir&s;t Man. His Corruption becomes ours, not only by imitation and example (as &s;ome would per|&s;wade us) but by Propagation. Which is yet further a&s;&s;erted &amp; confirmed by the &s;ame in&s;pired Apo&s;tle, when he &s;aith, <HI>We all were by Nature the Children of Wrath, as well as others,</HI> Eph. 2.3. <HI>We all,</HI> that is, <HI>Jews</HI> (for the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks of him&s;elf and his Countrymen) as well as <HI>others,</HI> namely <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and particularly the <HI>Ephe&s;ians</HI> to whom he writes, <HI>we all, Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles</HI> (which comprehends the whole Race of Mankind) are <HI>by Nature,</HI> that is, by our Birth &amp; de&s;cent <HI>Children of Wrath,</HI> liable to God's Wrath and Di&s;plea&s;ure, obnoxious to Puni&s;hment both here and hereafter.

Be very de|&s;irous then (as it is your Intere&s;t) to be acquaint|ed with this way of Man's being deliver'd from his mi&s;erable Condition. St. <HI>Paul</HI> briefly com|prizes it is tho&s;e few words, in <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.15. <HI>If through the Offence of one many be dead, much more the Grace of God, and the gift by Grace, which is by one Man, Je&s;us Christ, hath abound|ed unto many.</HI> And if you read what follows, you will find that this <HI>Happy State</HI> or Condition of Man, no le&s;s than the <HI>Mi&s;erable</HI> one before treated of, is repeated and explained to the very end of the Chapter. <HI>The Judgment was by one to Condemnation, but the Free Gift is of many Offences unto Ju&s;tification. If by one Man's Offence Death reigned by one, much more they which receive abundance of Grace &s;hall reign in Life by one, Je&s;us Christ. As by the offence of one Judgment came upon all to Condemnation, even &s;o by the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of one, the Free Gift came upon all Men unto Justification of Life.</HI> And the final Clo&s;e is, <HI>As &s;in hath reigned unto death, even &s;o Grace reigneth through Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s unto eternal Life, by Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord.</HI></P>

<PB N="65" REF="039825_0072_10148D25F6BA25A8">
it is certain that the Apo&s;tle is not here guilty of vain and u&s;ele&s;s Repetitions, but it is the Excel|lency and Nece&s;&s;ity of the Matter which cau&s;ed him to inculcate it in &s;o many words of the &s;ame Sen&s;e and Import.

But &s;uppo&s;e him void of Sin and Guilt, yet if he were a mere Man, he could not be able to &s;ave us, for it is above the &s;trength of a Creature to redeem lo&s;t Sinners; wherefore it was requi&s;ite that this Surety &s;hould be <HI>God</HI> as well as <HI>Man</HI>: And ac|cordingly it was ordained and appointed by the Sacred Trinity that one of that number, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Second Per&s;on,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Surety mu&s;t be God and Man.</NOTE> &s;hould undertake and accompli&s;h the Recovery and Re&s;tauration of lo&s;t Mankind, and that in order to that he &s;hould take upon him our Humane Nature.</P>

<P>Nay, let me tell you, you cannot attain to a right Knowledge of the former, but through the latter. To this purpo&s;e I offer tho&s;e words of the Ble&s;&s;ed St. <HI>Paul</HI> to your Meditations, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.6. <HI>God who commanded the light to &s;hine out of darkne&s;s, hath &s;hined in our Hearts, to give the light of the Knowledge of the Glory of God in the face of Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI>: As if the Apo&s;tle had &s;aid, God is a bright and glorious Sun, whom we cannot look upon directly, the Rays and Beams of his Maje&s;ty being &s;o tran&s;cendently Illu&s;trious. That we may therefore behold this Divine Glo|ry, and not be &s;truck blind with it, whil&s;t we are gazing on it, it is nece&s;&s;ary that we take a view of it, not as it is in it &s;elf ab&s;tractly, but as it re|pre&s;ents it &s;elf to us in the Face of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. There we may behold God in the be&s;t and &s;afe&s;t manner. That we may know him aright, we mu&s;t look on Chri&s;t who is the <HI>expre&s;s Image of his Per&s;on,</HI> and in whom he is well plea&s;ed.

<P N="10">&sect; 10. And thus I have acquainted you with the Threefold State of Man. He was &s;potle&s;s and innocent by his Creation: He was corrupted by Satan's Temptations, and &s;o apo&s;tatiz'd: But he is re&s;tor'd and renew'd by the wonderful Grace and Mercy of God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us. Or thus, Man was created at fir&s;t according to God's Image, in Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Holine&s;s, and con&s;equently was in a &s;tate of Happine&s;s; but he wilfully tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ed God's Command, and thereby lo&s;t his fir&s;t Purity and Innocence: Thence came Sin into the World, and Death by Sin. But notwith&s;tand|ing this, God at fir&s;t promi&s;ed, and afterwards actually &s;ent his Son to deliver Man out of this mi&s;erable Condition, and to Redeem him from Death and the Cur&s;e, and to confer upon him eternal Life and Happine&s;s.

</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">&sect;. 1. VIII. YOU mu&s;t have yet a more parti|cular knowledge of the way of <HI>Recovery</HI> of lo&s;t Man, as it relates to the <HI>Alteration</HI> which is to be made in <HI>us,</HI> and as it hath re&s;pect to tho&s;e things which <HI>we</HI> are to do. You mu&s;t know this, that in order to Salvation and Happi|ne&s;s it is nece&s;&s;ary you be changed in your Minds and in your whole Man: For (as you have been taught already) you were all born in a &s;tate of Nature, that is, you were corrupted and depra|ved both in your Souls and Bodies. Now, you

cannot pa&s;s from this State unto that of Grace but by <HI>Regeneration.</HI> You mu&s;t be born again:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Regene|ration.</NOTE> A new Nature mu&s;t be planted in you. Are they not the plain and expre&s;s words of Chri&s;t, who be&s;t knew the Terms of Salvation? <HI>Except a Man be born Again, he cannot &s;ee the Kingdom of God, Joh.</HI> 3.3. He can neither ar|rive to the Kingdom of Grace here, nor of Glory hereafter. This Regeneration or new Birth is then wrought in us, when the Graces of the Holy Spirit are inwardly planted and rooted in our Hearts, and when they bring forth Fruit in our outward Conver&s;ations. For this is certain, that the internal habit of Grace and Holine&s;s will &s;hew it &s;elf in good Works, in all vi&s;ible and apparent acts of Sobriety, Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Godline&s;s. We mu&s;t per&s;uade our &s;elves then of the indi&s;|pen&s;able nece&s;&s;ity of having our Minds and Con|&s;ciences, our Hearts and Lives adorned with all &s;piritual Endowments, for otherwi&s;e we have no marks and &s;igns of our being born again, and we have no hopes of &s;eeing the Kingdom of God.</P>
<P N="2">&sect;. 2. And this mu&s;t needs be &s;o, becau&s;e the&s;e Graces and Vertues are expre&s;s <HI>Conditions,</HI> on our part, (as hath been &s;aid before) of the new Cove|nant. And by <HI>Conditions</HI> I mean no more than this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch a Change, in order to the benefits of the new Covenant.</NOTE> that they are &s;uch <HI>ne|ce&s;&s;ary Requi&s;ites</HI> that without them none &s;hall be partakers of the benefits and privileges of the Co|venant. Thus <HI>Believing</HI> is made a condition of <HI>being &s;aved, Mark</HI> 16.16. and (which is the &s;ame) it is a condition or <HI>not

And in the beginning of the &s;ame Chapter, <HI>poverty of Spirit, purity of heart, meekne&s;s, mercifulne&s;s,</HI> are made conditions of <HI>Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s.</HI> And <HI>Repentance</HI> is ex|horted unto as a conditional a&s;&s;urance of our <HI>&s;ins being blotted out</HI>; that is, forgiven, <HI>Acts</HI> 3.19. And in &s;undry other places Pardon is offer'd, and Heaven is propo&s;ed on the terms or doing what is commanded us. For though Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;|ne&s;s be the only meritorious Cau&s;e of our Pardon, and of our Salvation and Happine&s;s, yet our Faith and Repentance, and other Graces, are the previous conditions of them on our part. And we are not to wonder at this, becau&s;e it is a Di|vine Appointment &amp; Con&s;titution; for it appears from the Holy Writ, that it was agreed from all Eternity between the Father and the Son, that Man &s;hould not be &s;aved but in a way of Duty, and that in order to this his Sins &s;hould not be remitted but on condition of Repentance; and con&s;equently, though the Go&s;pel be a di&s;pen&s;ation of Grace, yet it promi&s;es Pardon to none that per&s;i&s;t in their Rebellion. And this is the tenour
<PB N="77" REF="039825_0084_10148D349CCBB828" MS="y">
of the <HI>new Covenant</HI> which is made with Man, namely, that he &s;hall perform the <HI>Conditions</HI> which are required on his part; and therefore if he neglects this, he cannot expect to have the be|nefit of the Covenant.</P>
<P>Or if you di&s;like the word <HI>Conditions,</HI> call tho&s;e Graces &amp; Duties <HI>Qualifications,</HI> becau&s;e in their own nature they fir us for Heaven and Happi|ne&s;s, and the fruition of God.

<P N="3">&sect;. 3. The&s;e Graces have like|wi&s;e the nature of <HI>Means,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Graces of the Spirit, in order to eter|nal Life, have the &s;ame ne|ce&s;&s;ity as of Means to the End.</NOTE> and on that account are of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity, for the <HI>Means</HI> are in order to an <HI>End,</HI> &amp; the end can|not be obtained without them. So we find in Scripture that there is a nece&s;&s;ity of being Born again, of being religious and holy, and of obeying God's commands in order to the ob|taining of eternal Happine&s;s, which is the End we aim at. Or, the&s;e divine Endowments may be called <HI>In&s;truments</HI> and <HI>Helps</HI> of our Salvation, becau&s;e they further and advance it in that way which is peculiar to them, &amp; which is of God's own appointment: &amp; particularly &s;ome of them may be &s;aid to be In&s;truments of applying to us the Salvation wrought by Chri&s;t. Or la&s;tly, the&s;e
<PB N="78" REF="039825_0085_10148CF860E858D0">
Acts of Holine&s;s and Obedience in the Lives of the Faithful may be called <HI>Thankful Acknow|ledgments</HI> of God's Mercy to them in Chri&s;t Je|&s;us, they are ingenuous <HI>Retributions</HI> for the matchle&s;s kindne&s;s &s;hew'd to them in their Re|demption. And certainly it is mo&s;t highly rea|&s;onable that &s;uch grateful Returns &s;hould be made by tho&s;e that participate of the Life of God, and feel that new Principle in their hearts which is a powerful Spring of all that is good and ho|ly.</P>
<P N="4">&sect;. 4. Thus under what con&s;ideration &s;oever you look upon the Graces of the Go&s;pel, it ap|pears that we lie under a nece&s;&s;ary obligation of adorning our Lives with them. We mu&s;t be daily examining the Truth &amp; Sincerity of them, and we mu&s;t &s;trive to increa&s;e and improve them. According to St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s advice (2 Epi&s;t. chap. 1. ver. 5.) we are to <HI>add unto our faith vertue, and to vertue knowledge</HI> (that is, expe|rience of the ways of goodne&s;s and piety) <HI>and to knowledge temperance, and to temperance pa|tience, and to patience godline&s;s, and to godli|ne&s;s brotherly kindne&s;s, and to brotherly kind|ne&s;s charity,</HI> and the whole retinue of Divine Graces, which I &s;hall particularly de&s;cribe to you afterwards, when I come to the &s;econd general part of my Di&s;cour&s;e. We mu&s;t &s;hun all the Oc|ca&s;ions of Sin, and embrace all the Opportunities of doing good, and abound in all Vertues, and grow in every Grace, and per&s;evere in all Holi|ne&s;s &amp; Godline&s;s to the end of our Lives. This we mu&s;t do, or el&s;e we can never have the Be|nefit of Chri&s;t's Redemption; all his Undertak|ings will avail nothing without this. For as it
<PB N="79" REF="039825_0086_10148D38055D13D0">
was Gods's Will and Appointment that Chri&s;t &s;hould &s;uffer and make atonement for Sin &s;o <HI>this is the will of God, even our &s;anctification,</HI> 1 <HI>The&s;&s;.</HI> 4.3. And we are &s;ure that the great end and de&s;ign of Chri&s;t's coming was to re&s;tore us to our primitive Holine&s;s and Purity, and to renew the &s;piritual Life in us. Therefore let us not be ignorant of this great Truth, but act according to it, and commend Religion to the World by an exemplary Conver&s;ation, that <HI>others &s;eeing our good works, may glorifie our Father which is in Heaven.</HI></P>
<P N="5">&sect;. 5. And be&s;ides the&s;e Graces and Vertues which are to &s;hine in our Lives, there are certain <HI>Duties</HI> &amp; <HI>Exerci&s;es</HI> of Religion that are required of us. For though all Graces are our Duty, yet all the Duties &amp; Performances in Chri&s;tianity are not to be term'd Graces or Vertues, but they are rather to be call'd <HI>Means</HI> of Grace and <HI>Helps</HI> to Salvation.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duties of Religion made nece&s;&s;ary by Command.</NOTE> Such are holy Meditation, de|vout &amp; ardent Prayer, a diligent reading the Scriptures, attending on the Word preached, a pious celebrating of both the Sacraments, and the like Religious Exerci&s;es which are enjoined us by our Saviour &amp; his Apo&s;tles, of which I &s;hall di&s;tinct|ly di&s;cour&s;e when I come to the <HI>Practical Part</HI> of this Treati&s;e, for that is the proper place for them to be in&s;i&s;ted upon: but now I only offer tho&s;e things to you as matter of your <HI>Knowledge.</HI> You are by no means to be &s;trangers to this great Truth, that the Word &amp; Sacraments, &amp; the le&s;t of the In&s;titutions and Ordinances of divine Ap|pointment are to be made u&s;e of by us as means

and helps in order to Grace and Holine&s;s. We are to know, that as we cannot arrive at Happi|ne&s;s, unle&s;s we be furni&s;hed with inward Graces, &s;o neither can we attain that end, unle&s;s we con|&s;cientiou&s;ly perform tho&s;e outward Exerci&s;es of Religion which the Go&s;pel requires of us.

They talk of ex|alting Chri&s;t, whil&s;t they are throwing down all Chri&s;tian Duties; they are for &s;etting up Chri&s;t by pulling down his Ordinances, by di&s;paraging of tho&s;e Means which were of his own ordain|ing.</P>
<P>But we are to know that God is a God of <HI>or|der,</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 14.33.40. and what he thinks be&s;t for us, is really &s;o; therefore we are not to pre|&s;cribe Laws to him, but to re&s;t in what he hath determined.

He promi&s;es no where to make void the Mini&s;try of the Church, and to teach us from Heaven immediatly without the u&s;e of this, for this would be de&s;troying what he had &s;et up him&s;elf; for we read that our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour gave Commi&s;&s;ion to his Di&s;ciples to <HI>Teach and Baptize,</HI> (which includes all the other Or|dinances of Chri&s;t) and promi&s;ed <HI>to be with them always unto the end of the World,</HI> Matth. 28.20. which &s;hews that this Promi&s;e is made al&s;o to their Succe&s;&s;ors in the Mini&s;try; for the Apo&s;tles them&s;elves were not to be <HI>always,</HI> or <HI>unto the end of the World</HI>: Therefore this mu&s;t be meant of all the Faithful Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, in all the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Ages of the World.

The other Principle of Knowledge be|longing to this General Head which I am now upon, is this, that though the Graces and Duties I have been &s;peaking of are ours, becau&s;e they are exerted by us, yet none of them are the product of our own power and &s;trength. For we can do nothing acceptably in Religion without divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance, we can do no &s;piritual good without the Grace of God. <HI>We are not &s;ufficient of our &s;elves</HI> (&s;aith the Apo&s;tle) <HI>to think any thing as of our &s;elves, but our &s;ufficiency is of God,</HI> 2.

While&s;t a Man is Unrege|nerate and in a &s;tate of Nature, He hath a Free Will only to Sin, but hath no Will towards that which is Holy and Divine, but on the contrary is Aver&s;e to it: which proceeds from that Ina|bility which he contracted by <HI>Adam</HI>'s fall.

They are not only accepted for the &s;ake of the un&s;potted Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Je&s;us (as was &s;aid before) but becau&s;e they proceed from the Holy Gho&s;t, the Author of all &s;piritual Life and Goodne&s;s.

<P N="1">&sect;. 1. HAving given you a full enumeration of the Principles of Chri&s;tianity, which are required to be known by every Chri&s;tian, I am now to offer to you a plain Account of all that we are bound to <HI>Practice,</HI> in order to our Salvation and Happine&s;s. And by <HI>Practice</HI> I mean not only all outward Acti|ons of Religion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Practice of Religion.</NOTE> but tho&s;e like|wi&s;e that are inward, <HI>viz.</HI> the Thoughts and De&s;ires, the Will and Affections, the good and holy Inclinations of the Mind; and, in a word, all but <HI>Knowledge</HI> of which I have di&s;tinctly &s;poken before. It is ne|ce&s;&s;ary that I awe you a compleat Scheme or Platform of this Practical part of Chri&s;tianity, that you may have it always before your Eyes, and be con&s;tantly examining your Lives by it, and urging upon your &s;elves your exact confor|mity to it. And becau&s;e the Apo&s;tle hath redu|ced

<P N="3">&sect;. 3. It is the great work of Chri&s;tian <HI>Sobri|ety</HI> to regulate and moderate our Thoughts, Judgments and Opinions. We are not to <HI>think</HI> as we plea&s;e, for it is evident from Sacred Writ that Religion provides for the government and management of the Thoughts, and doth not leave them, at liberty, that is, to &s;ally forth and fix them&s;elves on any object without di&s;tinction. Concerning the Per&s;ons of the Old Degenerate World it is complain'd that <HI>every imagination of the thoughts of their hearts was only Evil, and that continually,</HI> Gen. 6.5.

<P N="5">&sect;. 5. To think meanly and humbly of our &s;elves, &amp; what we do, is another e&s;&s;ential part of Sobriety.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Humility.</NOTE> For this teaches us to be &s;en&s;ible of our manifold Infirmities and Deficiencies, our great Unwor|thine&s;s and Vilene&s;s, and thence to think of our &s;elves as becomes &s;uch weak and vile Creatures. Wherefore it is Chri&s;tianity alone that lays the Foundation of the deepe&s;t Humility, by acquaint|ing us with our fallen State,, and the true nature of our pre&s;ent Condition; which the wi&s;e&s;t of the Heathens were ignorant of, and con&s;equently knew not what true <HI>Humility</HI> was. This is taught us by the Go&s;pel only, which gives us a &s;ight of our &s;elves, of the Corruption of our Nature, and of the vilene&s;s of Sin, and thereby lays us low, and cau&s;es us to aba&s;e and humble our &s;elves. We &s;hould always govern our &s;elves by that Apo&s;to|lical Advice, <HI>Rom.</HI> 12.3. <HI>Not to think of our &s;elves more highly than we ought to think, but to think &s;oberly</HI>; that is, to judge of our &s;elves after an humble and mode&s;t manner, and not to pretend to more than we have, or to be better

than we are; yea, not to <HI>boa&s;t</HI> of any of the At|tainments we really are Ma&s;ters of, though they be never &s;o goodly and excellent, for they are but Gifts, they are what <HI>we have received,</HI> and <HI>why</HI> then <HI>&s;hould we glory as if we had not receiv|ed them</HI>? 1 Cor. 4 7. Though we be never &s;o well furni&s;hed with &s;piritual Endowments and Graces, we mu&s;t not be proud of them: But the greater our other Gifts &amp; Graces are, the greater &s;hould be our Humility. We mu&s;t always have lowly Thoughts of our &s;elves, by rea&s;on of our Failings and Offences both pa&s;t and pre&s;ent. Our own Sins &s;hould be thought to be the greate&s;t, as St. <HI>Paul</HI> was <HI>the chiefe&s;t of Sinners</HI> in his own account. So as to Opinion and Judgment, a &s;ober Chri&s;tian follows that Coun&s;el of the holy Writer, <HI>Be not wi&s;e in your own Conceits,</HI> Rom. 12.16. Do not arrogate to your &s;elves, &amp; fond|ly, prefer your own Judgment before that of o|thers; think this, that others may under&s;tand things as well, if not better, than your &s;elves.

<P N="6">&sect;. 6. <HI>Con&s;ideration</HI> is another part of <HI>Sobriety</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Con&s;idera|tion.</NOTE> for this bids us look into our &s;elves, &amp; conver&s;e with our own Souls, and reflect on our pa&s;t Actions, <HI>and think on our Ways</HI> (as the P&s;almi&s;t expre&s;&s;es it, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 119.59.) &amp; freely and impartially examine our State &amp; Condition.

Minds and Con&s;cience. From that fond opinion which we generally have of our &s;elves, we are wont to entertain fal&s;e Per&s;wa&s;ions concerning our Lives and Actions: We u&s;ually take &s;ome fair appearances, &s;ome goodly &s;hew &amp; &s;emblance of Vertue for real Sanctity, and &s;o we delude our &s;elves, and make a con&s;tant practice of it: And the wor&s;t is, we think to deceive God as well as our &s;elves. Now then, we are concerned to take &s;uch a cour&s;e as may prevent or cure this de&s;truc|tive Folly: And what more effectual way can we apply our &s;elves to than this, <HI>viz.</HI> to deal impar|tially with our &s;elves, and to di&s;cover our Self|delu&s;ions, by &s;earching narrowly into our Souls, and Ran&s;acking our Hearts and Manners?

So &s;hould we fix and determine our &s;elves by holy and religious Purpo&s;es, and not always pa&s;s our days in an unfixed po&s;ture, and &s;o hover in uncertainty.

Then they lead us to a &s;ight and &s;en&s;e of our pa&s;t Mi&s;carriages and Fail|ings, they wean us from the over-lu&s;cious Sweets of this World, and give us a reli&s;h of another, and a better State.

They are &s;erviceable, by the Divine Ble&s;&s;ing, to quicken our Prayers, to ha&s;ten our Repentance, and to promote all our Graces &amp; Duties. Which was long &s;ince experienced by that holy Man who profe&s;&s;ed, <HI>It was good for him that he had been afflicted, that he might learn God's Statutes,</HI> P&s;al. 119.71. Another of later Experience declar|ed, That <HI>his Tribulations were more nece&s;&s;ary for him than his Meal &amp; Drink.</HI> So &s;aid the pious <HI>Martin Luther.</HI> If we have re&s;pect likewi&s;e to the future State, we &s;hall find that Afflictions are u&s;eful to prepare us for that, becau&s;e they remind us of this great Truth, that this World which we are now in is not our proper Place, this Earth is not our Center; for if it were we &s;hould find Re&s;t and Quiet in it: If this were the Place de&s;igned for our Happine&s;s, we &s;hould not be unea&s;y and troubled in it.

Though you proceed not &s;o far as to di&s;temper your Brains, or to impair your Health, yet the lavi&s;hing away of &s;o much Time, is contrary to the Laws of Chri&s;tian Sobriety. Your Time is given you for the nece&s;&s;ary Works of your Calling, for the Bu&s;ine&s;s of this Life, but much more for the Concerns of another: And your Time is little enough for the&s;e.

This Ver|tue &s;trictly enjoins us to avoid Fornication and Adultery, and all manner of Uncleanne&s;s, be|cau&s;e the&s;e are direct Deviations from the natural End and U&s;e of tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions and Enjoyments which are permitted us; and therefore the recti|fied Nature and rational Part of Man allow not of them. <HI>The Body is not for Fornication but for the Lord,</HI> 1 Cor 6.13. As much as to &s;ay, our Bodies were ordained for Holy and Religious U&s;es, and therefore mu&s;t not be prophaned by Lu&s;t. They, as well as our Souls, were made to be employed in the Service of our <HI>Lord Je&s;us</HI>; they are dedicated and devoted to his Honour, and therefore it is a &s;acrilegious Alienation of them to make them &s;erviceable to Uncleanne&s;s. And as <HI>the Body is for the Lord,</HI> &s;o the Apo&s;tle adds, <HI>the Lord is for the Body,</HI> that is, Chri&s;t came to &s;anctifie and redeem our Bodies as well as our Souls, and therefore the one as well as the other mu&s;t be con&s;ecrated to his Service.

<P N="13">&sect;. 13. The Fir&s;t <HI>Relation</HI> is that of a King and his Subjects: and there are proper Duties belong|ing to both. The Office of Kings and Supreme Governours, or (as the Apo&s;tle calls them the <HI>Higher Powers</HI>) is thus briefly &s;umm'd up in <HI>Rom.</HI> 13.3. They are to be <HI>a Terror to Evil works, but tho&s;e that do Good are to have prai&s;e of them.</HI> It is ab&s;olutely required of Kings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Office of a Pious Prince.</NOTE> that they re&s;train Vice by puni&s;hing it: and if there be occa&s;ion, they ought to augment the Penalties of Sin and Wickedne&s;s, and make them more heavy and grievous, that Vice may not be augmented and increa&s;ed, by rea&s;on of the too ea&s;y re&s;traints that are laid upon it. And as there is need of prudent and &s;ea&s;onable Severity, &s;o on other occa&s;ions, Mildne&s;s and Clemency be|come a Prince. To cru&s;h and &s;queeze his peo|ple, is the mo&s;t abhorrent thought imaginable, and the farthe&s;t from his practi&s;e, for he Remembers that he is the Father of his Country, &amp; therefore is to be Compa&s;&s;ionate and Merciful, &amp; to bear a tender Affection to them, and to &s;hew by the En|couragements and Rewards, which he di&s;tributes, that he hath a &s;ingular Kindne&s;s and Favour for tho&s;e that are Vertuous and Worthy. A great part of his Royal work is to Pre&s;erve and A&s;&s;ert

the Civil Rights, Liberties, and Privileges of his Subjects, to Defend &amp; Protect them in their Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions and Properties; not to make his own Will the &s;tandard of his Actions towards them, but to keep the Law, as well as they. For a King is he that Rules according to the Laws, &amp; always makes the good of his People, his Grand and Principal End: whereas a Tyrant makes his own Will his Law, and never con&s;ults the well-fare of his Sub|jects. And as a good Prince maintains the &s;ecular Rights and Properties of tho&s;e over whom he is &s;et, &s;o in a more &s;pecial manner, he upholds them in their Religion, and thinks it an Honour as well as his Duty, to promote the Fear and Wor&s;hip of the mo&s;t High among them. <HI>We think it well be comes our high Place and Station,</HI> &s;aid the Em|perors, <HI>Theodo&s;ius</HI> &amp; <HI>Valentinian, to give Admo|nitions &amp; Injunctions to our Subjects concerning Religion.</HI> And tho&s;e were admirable words of <HI>Theodo&s;ius</HI> &amp; <HI>Honorius, We do nothing el&s;e ei|ther in the heat of War, or in the cool retire|ments of Peace, but Con&s;ult and Order bow the good People of our Empire may truly Wor&s;hip God, and &s;pend their days in his Service.</HI> Thus it is the Glory of Crown'd Heads, to advance the Honour of the King of Kings, to be Guardians of the Church, to be Patrons of Religion, and to be eminently Pious them&s;elves. And certain it is, that nothing is &s;o dear to Heaven, and &s;o benefi|cial to Mankind as &s;uch a Prince.</P>
<P N="14">&sect;. 14. Again, there is the Duty of Subordi|nate Magi&s;trates, who are call'd <HI>Governours that are &s;ent by</HI> the Supreme Power, 1 Pet. 2.14. And the Apo&s;tle there tells us, to what End and Purpo&s;e they are &s;ent, viz. <HI>For the puni&s;hment

of Evil doers,</HI> &amp; <HI>for the prai&s;e of them that do well.</HI> So that from comparing this with what <HI>St. Paul</HI> had &s;aid be|fore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The general Office of Chri|&s;tian Magi|&s;trates.</NOTE> it is clear, that the de&s;ign of the Supreme Ruler, and of tho&s;e that are placed under him, ought to be the &s;ame, that is, to take care that Vice be effectually re&s;train'd and that Vertue be encouraged; that Puni&s;hments be Inflicted, and Rewards di&s;pens'd according to the De&s;erts of Per&s;ons. They mi&s;erably pervert the End and De&s;ign of their <HI>bearing the Sword,</HI> if they turn the edge of it to the good, and the back of it to the Wicked.

And here in a more &s;ignal manner it is required of them that they take notice of tho&s;e Sins and Enormities which prevail mo&s;t in the places where they are, the reigning Sins of the Age, &s;uch as Idlene&s;s, Drunkenne&s;s, Whoredom, Swearing, For&s;wearing, Prophaning the Chri&s;tian Sabbath, exce&s;&s;ive Pride and Luxury, which la&s;t have been cured hereto|fore by Sumptuary Laws, but now the Di&s;ea&s;e breaks out afre&s;h: All the&s;e &s;hould be cha&s;ti&s;ed and kept under by publick Penalties.</P>
<P N="15">&sect; 15. And it is requi&s;ite in order to this, that Magi&s;trates be Per&s;ons of great Courage &amp; Re&s;o|lution, &amp; no ways affrighted at the thoughts of that ill treatment they meet with in the di&s;charge of of their Tru&s;t, and the faithful Execution of their Office. They are the Phy&s;icians of the Body Po|litick,
<PB N="136" REF="039825_0143_101661C23AF6F0B0">
and accordingly mu&s;t remember, that it is &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to oppo&s;e the <HI>Di&s;ea&s;e</HI> with great &s;everity, and to plea&s;e the <HI>Patient</HI> at the &s;ame time: And therefore they mu&s;t re&s;olve upon the unwearied performance of their Duty, although they purcha&s;e ill will, and be loaded with oblo|quy for their pains. All that I will add under this Head, is, that in Magi&s;trates and Rulers a per&s;onal Goodne&s;s and Worthine&s;s, and a care of their own Families are requi&s;ite to make them exactly fit for their Employment&punc; for none can &s;o effectually Rule over others, as tho&s;e that have the art of governing them&s;elves and the Per&s;ons that more nearly belong to them. Be&s;ides that, it is a &s;hame for them to terrifie Vice abroad, and yet to cheri&s;h it within their own Doors. It is &s;candalous to &s;trike with the Sword of Ju&s;tice at the Sins of the Town or Country they live in, and yet &s;uffer their own Habitations to be a Refuge of Prophanene&s;s and Irreligion, a Nur&s;ery of Lewd|ne&s;s and Immorality. Mu&s;t they check Vice only becau&s;e it is open and publick, and walks the Streets and Market-places? and at the &s;ame time mu&s;t it be received into their Families and lurk within their Walls, and there find Protection in|&s;tead of Puni&s;hment? No, by no means. The fir&s;t thing they are to do is to extirpate Vice out of their own Lives, &amp; tho&s;e of their Hou&s;hold, and then they may with confidence &amp; &s;ucce&s;s attempt the reforming of the Publick.</P>

By your means Defilement was derived to their Nature, and by rea&s;on of that defiled Temper they have con|tracted a pronene&s;s to all Evil, and an aver&s;ene&s;s to whatever is good: So that you are engaged on this account to endeavour, as much as in you lies, to heal that Infection which they catched of you, to cure that contagion which you imparted to them. You &s;et them into a &s;inful &amp; mi&s;erable World, and therefore you mu&s;t prevent their be|ing beguiled by it: You mu&s;t labour to enlighten and rectifie their Minds, and to bring them to a love of Holine&s;s &amp; Piety.

<P N="2">&sect;. 2. II. You that are <HI>Parents</HI> have the great|e&s;t Room in the Affections of your Children, and therefore on that account you have the advantage, above all others, of in&s;tructing them, and doing all Offices of Religion toward them. Your Chil|dren are prompted by the Dictates of Nature to love you, and what is there which Love will not

excite them to do? You are their be&s;t Friends and Benefactors: They are beholding to you for their Being, and their whole allowance is gene|rally from your hand. They will therefore hearken to you, and comply with your Directions and Admonitions, when you call upon them to con&s;ider their Ways, and bring Credit both to you and to them&s;elves by a vertuous Behaviour. Your kindne&s;&s;es to them are &s;o many &amp; &s;o great, that, be&s;ides the natural In&s;tinct of Love, they will find them&s;elves obliged to do any thing that you fairly propound to them, and to return your Kindne&s;&s;es in that way which they are capable to do. The <HI>Lacedemonian</HI> Women, when their <HI>Children</HI> proved undutiful and refractory, were wont to lay open their Brea&s;ts, &amp; to &s;hew them their P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ps, to remind them of their Love &amp; care in &s;uckling of them &amp; bringing them up, there|by (if it were po&s;&s;ible) to reduce them to a &s;en&s;e of their Duty, &amp; to &s;hame them into Obedience and good Manners. And certainly with Chil|dren of any Ingenuity this is a very cogent and powerful way of dealing with them? but e&s;pe|cially if they con&s;ider further that they were not only nouri&s;hed by their Parents, but have &s;ince received all manner of good things from them, they will &s;ee that they have yet a &s;tronger Obli|gation on them to do whatever their <HI>Parents</HI> enjoin them. Wherefore on this &s;core you have a va&s;t Influence upon them, and may hope to prevail with them, and fix your pious Coun&s;els and Precepts upon them.</P>
<P N="3">&sect;. 3. III. As <HI>Children</HI> are tied by the Law of Nature to love their <HI>Parents,</HI> &s;o you that are <HI>Pa|rents</HI> are bound by the &s;ame Law to love them.

They are part of you, and therefore the natural Affection which is in your Brea&s;ts teaches you to love them as your &s;elves. E&s;pecially the <HI>Mo|ther</HI>'s Love is reckoned as the greate&s;t, becau&s;e &s;he is &s;uppo&s;ed to have Nur&s;ed and Suckled her <HI>Children,</HI> which is not only a &s;ign of natural Af|fection, but a great increa&s;er of it in that Sex. But though this be much laid a&s;ide of late by an ill Cu&s;tom, yet however, there is an inbred princi|ple of Love in <HI>Mothers,</HI> as &s;uch. And moreo|ver, <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI> promotes and improves the na|tural In&s;tinct of Love in <HI>both Parents,</HI> and al&s;o directs it to the highe&s;t end. It &s;tirs them up not only to con&s;ult and procure the bodily good of their I&s;&s;ue, but it bids them love them chiefly in &s;uch a manner as is mo&s;t conducible to the good of their Souls, and their everla&s;ting Happi|ne&s;s. The active Principle of Love in them for|cibly moves them to this; for if they really love their Children, they will &s;trive to make them po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the greate&s;t Good, and of the chief|e&s;t Ble&s;&s;ings; and &s;uch are the Favour of God, Grace and Holine&s;s, and eternal Life. Where|fore you that are <HI>Parents</HI> mu&s;t mind this in the fir&s;t place, el&s;e you cannot be &s;aid to love your Children as you ought, that is, to love them with the true Love of a <HI>Parent.</HI> This we may gather from tho&s;e places of Scripture where the Great God is plea&s;ed to expre&s;s his Love and Care to us by <HI>Paternal Affection,</HI> yea not only by the Love of a <HI>Father,</HI> but of a <HI>Mother</HI>: For can we think that he con&s;ults only the Welfare of our Bodies? Doth he not &s;hew his Love by his re|gard to our Souls and our future Happine&s;s? What a poor Affection is that which extends no

Say not that you love your Off|&s;pring, when with indi&s;creet Fondne&s;s you con|nive at their Faults, of even allow of them. You do not love, but hate them, whil&s;t you act thus; for the Softne&s;s and Indulgence which you u&s;e to them will but &s;ooth them into Hell, &amp; thus you become unmerciful and cruel to their Souls; you &s;hew your &s;elves more &s;avage and barbarous than tho&s;e Idolatrous Parents of old, who made their Children pa&s;s through the Fire to <HI>Moloch.</HI> Sure|ly no one will call this <HI>Love.</HI> But then you may be truly &s;aid to exert this Affection toward your <HI>Children,</HI> when, be&s;ides your care of that part of their Education which relates to their Bodies, and outward Concerns, you look to their Souls, and mind their everla&s;ting Good, when you help them, through the divine Grace and A&s;&s;i&s;tance, to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>one thing nece&s;&s;ary which cannot be taken from them,</HI> which Thieves and Invaders cannot rob them of, which Power or Policy cannot extort from them, which Poverty and Exigence cannot deprive them of, which Sickne&s;s and Di&s;ea&s;es cannot impair in them, which Bani&s;hment and Per&s;ecution cannot &s;poil them of, which Death it &s;elf and the Grave can|not hinder them from, but rather help to put them into a full fruition of.

Whence it follows, that it is an huge in&s;tance of Folly and Indi&s;cretion to be very &s;ol|licious about leaving an E&s;tate to your <HI>Children,</HI> and yet not to concern your &s;elves in the lea&s;t for their &s;piritual Welfare and Happine&s;s.

There are indeed &s;ome In|&s;tances to the contrary in all Times, but that which we can gather from them is only this, that if good and vertuous Principles &s;uck'd in betimes are not always able to pre&s;erve Per&s;ons from A|po&s;tacy, and running into all &s;orts of evil, how dangerou&s;ly infected mu&s;t tho&s;e needs be, and how unavoidable is their Sin and De&s;truction who in their very tender Years were brought up in the practice of Vice, and were acquainted with no other Principles but &s;uch as lead them to it?

him, Go up thou Bald-head, Go up thou Bald-head. And he turned back, and look'd on them, and Cur&s;ed them in the name of the Lord. And there came forth Two She bears out of the Wood, and tare Forty and Two Children of them.</HI> As the P&s;almi&s;t informs us, <HI>that out of the Mouth of Babes &amp; Sucklings God hath ordained &s;trength,</HI> P&s;alm 8.2. Even the&s;e little ones may have the Seeds of Grace Sown in them betimes, &s;omething of God and Goodne&s;s may be found in them; &s;o on the contrary, <HI>here</HI> the&s;e little Children by Rea|&s;on of their Natural Depravity, and Evil Educa|tion, and Ill Examples &s;et before them, di&s;cover the Diabolical Spirit in them. As &s;oon almo&s;t as they have the u&s;e of their Tongues they employ them again&s;t God, and jeer at his Servants. Alas poor wretches they had heard Older ones Flout at this Man of God, they had &s;een Prophets abu&s;ed and affronted, they had learnt of their Parents at home to de&s;pi&s;e the Me&s;&s;engers of God, and to &s;peak unworthily of the Aged: &amp; now they think they may &s;afely follow their Parents &s;teps; there could be no fault in imitating of them.</P>
<P>Think of this, you that are Parents, remember how prone your Children are to do as you do, to make you their Pre&s;ident and Example, and to look upon your words &amp; actions as the &s;tandard of theirs.

Where|as they ought to have Reverenced this Holy Man, to have Re&s;pected his Age, and honoured his Sa|cred Profe&s;&s;ion, and that Extraordinary Spirit which he was endued with, and which was be|come Famous throughout all <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> they on the contrary Irreverently &s;coff'd at him, &amp; reproach|ed his Old Age, &amp; hooted at him for his Years: They who&s;e hair was &s;carcely grown, derided the Prophet becau&s;e his was fallen by Age.</P>
<P>Where by the way let Parents be reminded to inculcate this betimes on their little ones, that they mu&s;t by no means de&s;pi&s;e any Per&s;ons for their Years, nor mock at any for their natural Defects and Infirmities. If they be not carefully check'd as to this particular, they will in time laugh at their Parents, &amp; &s;corn them when they are Old: they will upbraid them for their Weakne&s;&s;es and Failings, which are the Con&s;tant and In&s;eperable attendants of declining Years. Let Parents there|fore Rehear&s;e this Remarkable Story in the Ears of their Children, and cau&s;e them to Remember what was the Fate of that young crew who vili|fied the Man of God.

<P N="1">&sect;. 1.

and accordingly he took care to bring them up in the practice of Godline&s;s, as appears from the pious care he had about his Son <HI>I&s;aac</HI>'s Marriage, and from the happy propagation of Religion in that Race and Family. Another illu&s;trious In|&s;tance of a Godly Parents concern for his Children is holy <HI>Job,</HI> of whom it is thus recorded, <HI>Job.</HI> 1. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, 5. <HI>His Sons went &amp; fea&s;ted in their Hou&s;es, every one his day, and &s;ent and called for their three Si&s;ters, to eat &amp; drink with them. And it was &s;o when the Days of their Fea&s;ting were gone about, that Job &s;ent &amp; &s;anctified them, &amp; ro&s;e up early in the Morning, &amp; offered burnt offer|ings according to the number of them all: For Job &s;aid, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> may be that my Sons have &s;inned and cur&s;ed God in their Hearts. Thus did Job con|tinually.</HI> It is evident, that <HI>Job</HI>'s Piety was not only Per&s;onal, Chap 1. Ver&s;e 1. but relative, that is, extended to his Children; of which here is a very &s;ingular proof from his godly Fear and Jealou&s;y. He was afraid his Children had too freely indulged &s;ome unlawful practice in the time of their Fea&s;ting &amp; Mirth, and ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> thereby offendad God. Or, &s;uppo&s;e they were not out|wardly and vi&s;ibly prophane, but had been &s;o &s;e|cretly and in their Thoughts, for that may be the meaning of <HI>Cur&s;ing God in their Hearts</HI>: Al|though their Words and Actions did not betray any Irreverence towards the Maje&s;ty of God, yet he fear'd their Minds might inwardly conceive &s;omething unworthy of him. Which excellent Pattern &s;hould remind all <HI>Parents</HI> of rendring the good of their Childrens Souls, &amp; taking care that they offend not God in any thing. They are u&s;u|ally heard to &s;ay when their young ones are long

out of their &s;ight, It may be the are come to &s;ome harm, it may be &s;ome Evil hath befallen them, they have been beaten, or abu&s;ed, or the like. Thus do <HI>Parents</HI> expre&s;s their <HI>Fears</HI> con|cerning their Children, but &s;eldom or never in the Language of this good Man, <HI>It may be they have &s;inned, &amp; cur&s;ed God.</HI> Ob&s;erve the Stile, <HI>It may be:</HI> a po&s;&s;ibility of the thing, and a mere &s;u&s;picion were ground enough, you &s;ee, for his Godly care and fear; &s;o extreamly tender was he of his Childrens good.</P>
<P>Which al&s;o appear'd from the Means he u&s;ed for their &s;afety, <HI>He offered burnt-offerings ac|cording to the number of his Children,</HI> &amp; in order to this <HI>he &s;anctified them,</HI> that is, he &s;olemnly pre|pared them for that &s;acred performance, that it might prove &s;ucce&s;sful. <HI>Job</HI>'s Children had re|fre&s;hed them&s;elves with free Eating &amp; Drinking at one anothers Hou&s;es: Now he takes care that their Minds be intent upon Religion. Friendly Re|pa&s;t is followed with Piety &amp; Devotion. As they Fea&s;ted together, &s;o <HI>Job</HI> would have them meet and Pray together, and lament their pa&s;t Mi&s;car|riages, and thankfully acknowledge the Mercy and Goodne&s;s of God to them, and jointly endea|vour by Sacrifice to avert his Di&s;plea&s;ure. <HI>Thus did Job continually,</HI> that is, as often as his Sons and Daughters met together, he never forgot to call upon them to examine their Hearts, &amp; &s;earch into their Ways, &amp; to make their Peace with God. The &s;ame Principle that &s;et him on work at fir&s;t, carried him through it, and cau&s;ed him to per&s;e|vere to the End.

And in other places he lets us know what excellent Le&s;&s;ons they in&s;tilled into him. Not only his Father, but his Mother took upon her the care of In&s;tructing him in his Younger years, as is evident from the la&s;t Chapter of the <HI>Proverbs,</HI> the former Part of which <HI>is the Prophecy that his Mother taught him.</HI> ver. 1. She infu&s;ed into her Son the Reverence of a <HI>Deity</HI> betimes, and con&s;tantly pray'd that <HI>God would be with him,</HI> whence perhaps he is &s;ti|led <HI>Lemuel,</HI> and &s;he furni&s;h'd him with Divine <HI>Sayings</HI> and <HI>Proverbs</HI> to &s;ettle his Judgments and direct his Practice. Thus <HI>Bath&s;heba</HI> was both Mother and Tutoure&s;s to <HI>Solomon</HI>: and in part of requital he endited a Panegyrick of her prai&s;e, and in the Commendation of all tho&s;e of her Sex who imitate &s;o Royal and Religious a Pattern, as you my read at the 10th ver. of the la&s;t Chap|ter of the <HI>Proverbs,</HI> to the End.

But this is the thing which at pre&s;ent we are taking notice of, that both Fa|thers and Mothers ought to be Exemplary in their Religious Educating of their Children. <HI>My Son hear the In&s;truction of thy Father, &amp; for &s;ake not the Law of thy Mother,</HI> Prov. 1 8.

It is plain then that the In&s;tructing and Educating of the&s;e in Religion are the Duty of a Wife,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Education the Womans care as well as the Mans.</NOTE> as well as of a Husband; nay, they &s;eem to be more particularly the Care and Employment of the former be|cau&s;e &s;he is mo&s;t Conver&s;ant with the&s;e young ones, &amp; hath the opportunities of informing their minds, and &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ping their man|ners. And it is as true likewi&s;e that Mothers, if they be vitiou&s;ly inclined, are by rea&s;on their more intimate and frequent conver&s;e with their Children, capable of doing them the greater harm by In&s;tilling of corrupt Principles into them. And therefore it is perhaps that in the Hi&s;tory of the Kings of <HI>Judah</HI> their <HI>Mothers</HI> names are mention|ed, both of the Religious &amp; Irreligious Kings, as bearing a part in the Commendation of their Sons that were Good, and in the Di&s;grace and Infamy of them that were wicked, becau&s;e they were &s;o In&s;trumental and Serv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ceable towards either. The extraordinary piety of King <HI>Hezekiah</HI> may perhaps be partly Attributed to the whole&s;ome Admonitions of his Mother <HI>Abijah,</HI> 2 Chron. 29.1.

And if Mothers can thus prevail on their Sons when they are arrived to &s;ome Maturity of Age, and are as it were at their own di&s;po&s;al, much more are they able to influence upon them when they are younger, and under their Wings, and wholly at their Command. Wherefore let <HI>Mothers</HI> make u&s;e of their Authority, &amp; whil&s;t they have their Children at their Becks, train them up to what is good &amp; holy, in&s;truct them in the Law of God and the nece&s;&s;ary Matters of Salva|tion, inure them to pious Di&s;cipline, and order their Lives aright.

<P>This I take to be the true &s;en&s;e of the Words, for it is likely that <HI>Child bearing</HI> is here put for the whole di&s;charge of the Office required of a Married Woman in her dome&s;tick Capacity, which is u&s;ually mo&s;t exerci&s;ed &amp; &s;een in bringing forth and breeding up of her <HI>Children.</HI> By <HI>Child bear|ing,</HI> as I apprehend, is chiefly meant Educating of Children, becau&s;e in vain are they <HI>Born,</HI> unle&s;s they be <HI>In&s;tituted</HI> &amp; <HI>Educated</HI>; the one is wholly in order to the other, and therefore it is no won|der that it is mentioned in the place of it.

Finally, I &s;ugge&s;t this as another Con|&s;ideration and Motive, that the more Holy any Per&s;ons are, the more Dutiful they are to their Parents.

three Rea&s;ons; Fir&s;t, becau&s;e tho&s;e Servants who are mo&s;t Religious towards God will prove mo&s;t faithful to you. If their care of your Bu&s;i|ne&s;s be founded on an upright Con&s;cience, and a true &s;en&s;e of the Obligations which are laid upon them by Chri&s;tianity, they will then behave them|&s;elves in their places as it becomes true Chri&s;tian Servants. Think not that any will do their Duty aright, &amp; per&s;evere in it, unle&s;s the Principles of Godline&s;s &amp; Righteou&s;ne&s;s have taken fa&s;t hold of their Hearts. We read in <HI>Gen.</HI> 39 9. what it was that made <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> &s;o true to <HI>Potiphar,</HI> his Ma&s;t|er: <HI>how can I do this great Wickedne&s;s,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>and &s;in again&s;t God</HI>? As much as if he had &s;aid, I cann't be fal&s;e to my Ma&s;ter who hath entru&s;ted me with his Hou&s;hould Affairs and all his E&s;tate: I cann't be injurious to my Mi&s;tre&s;s by comply|ing with her Temptations, I cannot be unfaithful to either, becau&s;e I have a greater Ma&s;ter to &s;erve, and I dare not di&s;plea&s;e &amp; offend him. St. <HI>Paul</HI> was urgent with <HI>Philemon</HI> to take <HI>One&s;imus</HI> a|gain into his Service, becau&s;e being Converted he would be <HI>profitable to him,</HI> Ver.11. he being now a good Chri&s;tian, would prove a good and u&s;e|ful Servant. You then that are Ma&s;ters and Mi&s;|tre&s;&s;es of Families, be exhorted to in&s;truct your Servants in Religion, call upon them to make Con&s;cience of their ways, and to be truly Vertu|ous, becau&s;e thereby they will be in a capacity to &s;erve you faithfully. It is your Intere&s;t to ac|quaint them with the Will of God, and to allure them to the love of it: Your very worldly Ad|vantage obliges you to this, for you will find a pre&s;ent Benefit accruing to you by it, and you will be abundantly recompen&s;ed for your Care and

<P N="24">&sect; 24. Secondly, This is another Rea&s;on to be thought of, That pious Servants derive a <HI>Ble&s;|&s;ing</HI> on a Family. <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> whom I mentioned before, is an eminent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ce of this; <HI>Gen.</HI> 3 39. <HI>The Lord made all he did to pro&s;per in his hand</HI>: and Ver. 5 <HI>It came to pa&s;s from the time that Potiphar had made him over&s;een in his b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u&s;e, and over all that he had that the Lord ble&s;&s;ed the Egyptians hou&s;e for Jo&s;eph's &s;ake, and the ble&s;&s;ing of the Lord was upon all that he had, in the hou&s;e and in the field.</HI> How in&s;trument|al was <HI>Naaman</HI>'s Servant (who it is probable was a Pro&s;elyte to the True Religion) in promoting the Welfare and real Good of his Ma&s;ter; How <HI>profitable</HI> even in this &s;en&s;e was <HI>One&s;imus</HI> to his Ma&s;ter <HI>Philemon</HI>? You that have Servants under you, u&s;e your utmo&s;t endeavours to further Reli|gion &amp; Goodne&s;s in them, for one Religious Ser|vant may bring down a Ble&s;&s;ing upon a whole Hou&s;e. By minding the Spiritual Good of your Servants you may be rewarded in your &s;ecular and wordly Affairs. As on the contrary, you may be bla&s;ted in your worldly concerns for the &s;ake of one or more impious Servants that you keep in your Families. For as I ob&s;erved before that <HI>Parents</HI> and <HI>Children</HI> mutually derive a Ble&s;&s;ing or Cur&s;e on one another, &s;o it is as tru&punc; that <HI>Ma&s;ters</HI> &amp; <HI>Servants</HI> do the like.</P>
<P N="25">&sect;. 25. Thirdly, Let this be con&s;idered, That wicked Servants will corrupt your Children, and &s;et back all the In&s;tructions you gave them, and

therefore on this account endeavour to check all Vice, and nouri&s;h all goodne&s;s in your Servants. As you de&s;ire that your Care and Pains about your Children may prove &s;ucce&s;sful, &s;ee that you promote Religion among your Servants, take care that they &s;erve the Lord as well as you. Encou|rage Piety in them as much as Indu&s;try and Di|ligence. Nay, you &s;hould be more troubled at their offending of God than your &s;elves.

So likewi&s;e a Servant is to mind the Work he is &s;et about, or the proper Charge which is incumbent on him, as he is of &s;uch or &s;uch a Trade or Profe&s;&s;ion. Here then Negligence is to be condemned in one of this Relation. All Carele&s;ne&s;s and Sloth &amp; Idlene&s;s, yea and even that <HI>Sanntring</HI> Humour which po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es &s;ome Servants, are un&s;ufferable; for it is of the very E&s;&s;ence of a good Servant to have his Thoughts upon his Bu&s;ine&s;s, and indu&s;triou&s;ly to pur&s;ue it.</P>

Thirdly, <HI>Sincerity</HI> is another qualifica|tion, for you &s;ee this it often menti|oned,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sincerity.</NOTE> and that in variety of Expre&s;&s;i|ons. Servants are bid to Obey their Ma&s;ters <HI>in Singlene&s;s of heart,</HI> or (as 'tis in the Greek) in &s;implicity of heart, out of a Simple and Uncorrupt Principle, out of a hearty de&s;ire and Intention to do their Duty, and to di&s;charge a good Con&s;cience. And they are enjoyn'd to do Service unto their Ma&s;ters <HI>as unto Christ,</HI> as if he were the Immediate Ma&s;ter under whom they &s;erv'd. And the Apo&s;tle adds that they mu&s;t look upon them&s;elves <HI>as the Servants of Christ,</HI> they mu&s;t own his Authority in that of their Ma&s;ters, &amp; they mu&s;t chiefly indeavour to plea&s;e Him, &amp; not Act as <HI>men-plea&s;ers,</HI> that is, for Ba&s;e and Sini&s;ter ends; they mu&s;t not obey <HI>with Eye-Service,</HI> that is, do the Part of Servants only when their Ma&s;ter or Mi&s;tre&s;s is pre&s;ent, and hath an Eye upon them: but they ought to Act out of a &s;en&s;e of their Duty, &amp; therefore do it Faithfully, whether any takes notice of them or no. <HI>With good will they do Service,</HI> they perform it Free|ly and Chearfully, becau&s;e God hath enjoined it, and it is plea&s;ing to him. Thus you &s;ee what is required of Servants as to the Principle and man|ner of their Behaviour towards tho&s;e who are &s;et over them: it mu&s;t be with Sincerity &amp; Upright|ne&s;s of heart.

If this pair of Relatives do not di&s;charge their Duty a|right, the re&s;t of the Family never can; yea, the mi&s;carriage of Per&s;ons in this State of Life may not unfitly be A&s;&s;igned as a main cau&s;e of their mis|behaviour in tho&s;e other Conditions and Capaci|ties before mentioned; and therefore it is nece&s;&s;a|ry that I &s;peak particularly concerning the&s;e, that the good Deportment of the&s;e Chief Heads of the Dome&s;tick Body may be &s;ecured. In order to this a Good Foundation is to be laid at fir&s;t: the Married Life mu&s;t be commenced Wi&s;ely and Di&s;creetly, with great Deliberation &amp; Thought|fulne&s;s. The Man mu&s;t make choice of <HI>a Meet Help,</HI> one that is Religious &amp; Vertuous, and &s;ui|table to him as to his E&s;tate, Age, Calling, and other Circum&s;tances.

For, ac|cording to his &s;olemn Ingagement, he is to make her partaker in his worldly Goods: And by help of that Calling or Employment which Providence hath determined him to, or of the E&s;tate and Revenues which he either brought to her, or had with her, or by both, it is incumbent upon him to make &s;ufficient Pro|vi&s;ion for her, that they may jointly &s;hare in that comfortable Sub&s;i&s;tence which their Station and Rank in the World call for. But yet this is to be taken with &s;ome Limitation; for if the Con|dition and Circum&s;tances of the Woman be &s;uch, that &s;he is in a capacity to contribute per&s;onally towards the maintenance of the Family, by &s;ome Skill in a lawful Employment of her own, or by giving a&s;&s;i&s;tance to her Husband in his, &s;he then is engaged to be &s;erviceable in the &s;upport of her Hou&s;hould.

Be|&s;ides the contrary may prove very hurtful to them, and &s;o we &s;hall be injurious to them. For a Lyar, one that loveth and maketh Lyes, wrongs and injures his Brethren; yea, he &s;poils all Socie|ty and Conver&s;e, for there can be no Faith or Cre|dit among Men (which is the &s;upport of all Hu|mane Society) if Truth be laid a&s;ide, and Fal&s;|hood takes place. Speech was given us by God to declare our Minds and Thoughts to others, that thereby a mutual Conver&s;e and Communion might be maintained: But Lying, which is &s;peak|ing contrary to what we think or know, perverts this end and de&s;ign of Speech, and therefore mu&s;t needs prove very de&s;tructive. Wherefore follow the Apo&s;tolical advice, <HI>Col.</HI> 3.9. <HI>Lye not one to another,</HI> do not utter and deliver that as Truth which you know to be fal&s;e; but <HI>putting away Lying, &s;peak the Truth every Man with his Neighbour,</HI> Eph. 4.25. And the Apo&s;tle there adds this Rea&s;on, <HI>For we are Members one of a|nother</HI>: As much as to &s;ay. All Men are fellow-Members, they belong all to the &s;ame Body and

And not only as we are Men, but much more as we are Chri&s;tians, we are Mem|bers of one another, being united unto Chri&s;t Je&s;us our Head: &amp; therefore we mu&s;t not dare to Lye, and thereby deceive &amp; hurt our Brethren to whom we are &s;o nearly related. Nay we are not permit|ted to tell a Lye, though we were &s;ure it would hurt no Body, nay, though we were certain it would tend to our own or others Safety and Advantage: And the rea&s;on is this, becau&s;e we are forbid <HI>to do evil, that good may come of it,</HI> Rom. 3.8.</P>

It is unworthy of a Chri&s;tian to make the wor&s;t of Mens Actions, and to repre&s;ent them to others as &s;uch; but it is much more ba&s;e and unworthy, ye utterly to be abhorred, to detract from our Neighbours Credit out of a Principle of ill Will &amp; Malice toward them.

And as for <HI>Adultery,</HI> which is the De|bauching of a Married Woman, that is a Fact which is yet much more Unju&s;t and Unrighteous, for be&s;ides the &s;tain of Lewdne&s;s there is a breach of Faith, and a perjurious violating of the Bond of Matrimony. Therefore of the Adultere&s;s it is &s;aid, Prov. 2.17. <HI>She forgetteth the Covenant of her God,</HI> that is, &s;he prophanely breaks that So|lemn and Sacred Covenant which &s;he made at Marriage.

It is a &s;ignal act of Grace that they are admitted into Favour at la&s;t. So <HI>few</HI> are the Per&s;ons that are pardon'd and &s;aved, in compari&s;on of the great Multitudes that peri&s;h in this Sin, that they are here &s;aid to be <HI>none.</HI> Such is the Nature of this heinous Vice, when per&s;i&s;ted in, that it is attend|ed generally with Impenitence. For (as the Pro|phet tells us) <HI>Whoredom</HI> (no le&s;s than exce&s;s of <HI>Wine</HI>) <HI>takes away the heart,</HI> Ho&s;. 4.11. that is, it is a Sin of that quality that it deprives the mind of all &s;en&s;e of Goodne&s;s, it &s;tupifies the Con&s;cience, and naturally hardens tho&s;e that commit it. It makes them in&s;en&s;ible of their Guilt, though it is the greate&s;t imaginable; and it cau&s;es them to take no notice of their Danger, which yet is as great as can be. For thus <HI>Solomon</HI> expre&s;&s;es the mi&s;erable Condition of a Lewd Woman, and tho&s;e that have &s;inful Conver&s;e with her, <HI>Her hou&s;e enclineth un|to death, &amp; her paths unto the dead, Prov.</HI> 2.18.

I threw away Pounds upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le and di&s;&s;o|lute Companions, I expanded my Revenues in the maintaining of my Plea&s;ures, but I could not afford to part with the &s;malle&s;t Sums to tho&s;e who&s;e low and indigent Condition cried aloud for Relief. I &s;pent that in Sin &amp; Vanity which I might, and ought to have employed in charitable Undertak|ings.

What comfort now can there be in &s;uch Reflections as the&s;e&punc; Nay, how great mo&s;t the Angui&s;h and Torment be which always accompany &s;uch Thoughts? For when a Man thinks with him&s;elf that he had an opportu|nity to do good, and yet that he wholly neglected it, it is the mo&s;t dreadful Sting of Con&s;cience ima|ginable.

<P N="1">&sect;. 1. THE Third and La&s;t Branch of the Chri&s;tian Religion, as it re&s;pects our Practice, is our more e&s;pecial Duty toward <HI>God.</HI> For though all tho&s;e Duties of Chri&s;tianity before-named have relation unto Him (it being impo&s;|&s;ible there &s;hould be any acts of Religion with|out it) yet this which I am now to &s;peak of hath a more immediate and direct regard to Him, and therefore from the &s;peciality of its Object it is called <HI>Godline&s;s,</HI> to di&s;tingui&s;h it from the other

two Branches of Practical Religion already treat|ed of. And truly <HI>This</HI> is the noble&s;t and mo&s;t exalted part of Religion, becau&s;e thereby we &s;o nearly and intimately conver&s;e with <HI>God.</HI> Whereas, on the contrary, <HI>Ungodline&s;s</HI> and <HI>Pro|phanene&s;s</HI> are the mo&s;t elevated Crimes, and the blacke&s;t Imputation that any Man can be charged with, becau&s;e hereby we wilfully alienate our &s;elves from God, and are Strangers to all Com|munion with him. What the nature of this part of Religion is, and wherein it con&s;i&s;ts, I will di&s;tinctly &s;hew you in the&s;e following Particulars.</P>
<P N="2">&sect;. 2. I. It requires of us to acknowledge <HI>God</HI> and his <HI>Pro|vidence</HI> in the Univer&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Godline&s;s, and wherein it con&s;i&s;ts.</NOTE> and to live in a con&s;tant &s;en&s;e of them.

which you are convinced of. You mu&s;t own it to be a great ea&s;e and &s;atisfaction to your Minds, to con&s;ider that the All-wi&s;e Creator concerns him&s;elf with the World, that it is filled with his Pre&s;ence, and govern'd by his Care, and that nothing comes to pa&s;s without his di&s;po&s;al. This is the fir&s;t part of our immediate Duty to|wards the mo&s;t High, and it is the Foundation of all the re&s;t that I &s;hall name.</P>
<P N="3">&sect;. 3. II.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ju&s;t thoughts concerning God.</NOTE> It is contain'd in our immediate Duty toward <HI>God,</HI> that our Thoughts be employ'd in the Contemplation of him. We mu&s;t fre|quently repre&s;ent his Excellencies to our Minds, and po&s;&s;e&s;s our Hearts with &s;uch high &amp; worthy Conceptions of him as the&s;e, namely, that he is infinitely Powerful, Ju&s;t, Wi&s;e and Good, that all his ways are holy, and that he can do nothing a|mi&s;s, and that we ought to acquie&s;ce in his Word and Works as mo&s;t Rea&s;onable and Righteous. But becau&s;e <HI>his ways are not like Man's ways,</HI> but are in many things <HI>un&s;earchable &amp; pa&s;t find|ing out,</HI> therefore we mu&s;t not too boldly pry into them, and call them into que&s;tion. When we think of God, we mu&s;t lay a&s;ide all audacious Curio&s;ity, as becometh poor weak Creatures who are not able to comprehend an Infinite Being. Such Thoughts and Re&s;olves are nece&s;&s;ary in order to the right di&s;charging of our Duty toward God. We mu&s;t not only acquaint our &s;elves with his manifold Perfections, which was the Subject of the Fir&s;t Part of this Treati&s;e, but (which is the thing that I now urge) we ought to call them to mind frequently, to revolve them in our Thoughts, con&s;tantly to meditate upon them, and regulate
<PB N="267" REF="039825_0274_10148DE8C793F100">
our Lives by them. This is matter of Practice.</P>
<P N="4">&sect;. 4. III. <HI>Godline&s;s</HI> requires that we &s;hew a Reverence to the Supreme Being in our Words and Speeches.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Expre&s;s Re|verence to his Name and Being.</NOTE> As the Mind and Thoughts, &s;o the Tongue mu&s;t be concerned in our Duty towards God. There mu&s;t be no irreverend and undecent mentioning of his Name, no Pre&s;umptuous and rude Language concerning &s;piritual My&s;teries; no vain, light and fooli&s;h Words concerning Things that have relation to Religion; no treating the Holy Scriptures with Di&s;re&s;pect and Irreverenec; no wre&s;ting and di&s;torting of them; no &s;peaking Irreligiou&s;ly concerning any of God's Works; no prophane and bla&s;phemous Expre&s;&s;ions; nor any Words that are derogatory to God's Honour: for all this <HI>is taking the Name of the Lord God in vain,</HI> which is ab&s;olutely forbidden.</P>
<P N="5">&sect;. 5. Again, all unlawful &amp; prophane <HI>Swear|ing,</HI> and even the u&s;e of vain and &s;ight <HI>Oaths</HI> are to be dete&s;ted and &s;hun'd as another In&s;tance of <HI>Ungodline&s;s</HI> in Words. A Modern Author tells us, That this wicked Interjection of Speech is &s;o much practi&s;ed &amp; approved of, that &s;ome Ma&s;ters of Language in <HI>France</HI> make it their Third Le&s;|&s;on to their Scholars, to get by heart &s;o many <HI>Oaths,</HI> old &amp; new. One would think that <HI>England</HI> (as well as our Neighbouring Country) had &s;ome of the&s;e Tutours, were it not that we find many &s;o ready to Swear, that they need <HI>not be taught.</HI> The Streets and Markets, and pub|lick Hou&s;es, &amp; Places of Conver&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ungodline&s;s of Prophane Swearing.</NOTE> and even private Dwellings, and A|partments te&s;tifie the Truth of this,

and bear witne&s;s to the common Guilt which is now grown &s;o crying, and, if not &s;peedily &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, will bring down Judgments on this Nation of a very high quality. For cer|tainly it is the mo&s;t unrea&s;onable thing imaginable that poor dependent Creatures, who cannnot &s;ub|&s;i&s;t one moment without the &s;pecial &s;upport and immediate influence of the Almighty, &s;hould dare to prophane his Holy Name by ra&s;h and impious Oaths: This is one of the mo&s;t unaccountable and &s;trange Enormities that the Inhabitants of a Land can be guilty of, and therefore, if it be per&s;i&s;ted in, it will meet with &s;ome &s;trange and unu&s;ual Puni&s;hment.</P>
<P N="6"><NOTE PLACE="marg">Perjury.</NOTE>&sect;. 6. With this may be joined all Fal&s;e and Deceitful Swearing, which is generally known by the Name of <HI>Perjury,</HI> and is too frequent a practice in the&s;e days. But it is a direct Violation of that Divine Law, <HI>Thou &s;hall not for &s;wear thy &s;elf,</HI> Mat. 5 33. and is the Root of infinite Mi&s;chief in the World. And here I will al&s;o mention that Helli&s;h Practice which &s;o much prevails amon&s;t us, namely, the u|&s;ing of God's Name in <HI>Cur&s;ing</HI> &amp; <HI>Ex|ecrations.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cur&s;ing.</NOTE> We daily hear Men crying out to Heaven to inflict the greate&s;t of Plagues and Judgments not only on others, but up|on them&s;elves. Is it not mo&s;t amazing and pro|digious that in a Civilized Nation, profe&s;&s;ing Re|ligion, there &s;hould be Per&s;ons who every Mi|nute call on God to <HI>Damn them</HI>? All the&s;e Acts of <HI>Ungodline&s;s</HI> we are perfectly to abhor and a|void, &amp; to do what we can to prevent the &s;pread|ing of them.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="269" REF="039825_0276_10148DEDDAFE85C0">&sect;. 7. More e&s;pecially as to the Sin of Com|mon and Prophane Swearing (which prevails &s;o much every where at this day)<NOTE PLACE="marg">Remedies a|gain&s;t prophane Swearing.</NOTE> be careful to &s;ecure your &s;elves from the Commi&s;&s;ion of it by &s;uch helps and means as the&s;e, Fir&s;t, Check your &s;elves at the fir&s;t Tendencies to this Sin. The neglecting of this hath proved very pernicious to many Per&s;ons: they in&s;tead of &s;tifling and &s;uppre&s;&s;ing their Incli|nations to this vice, give way to it, and &s;o it grows up into a Habit and Cu&s;tom, which they can never afterwards ma&s;ter. And they generally are &s;o free as to own this, that by a Continued Practice they have &s;o fixed them&s;elves in this way, that they can't rid them&s;elves of it: though they are not &s;o Ingenuous as to confe&s;s that this Excu&s;e adds to their fault. Wherefore be careful to u&s;e an early Di&s;cipline upon your &s;elves; re&s;i&s;t this &s;in betimes, and you will get the conque&s;t of it.</P>
<P N="8">&sect;. 8. Secondly, Avoid all the <HI>Occa&s;ions</HI> of Swearing. Among which <HI>Anger</HI> &amp; <HI>Pa&s;&s;ion</HI> may be mentioned in the fir&s;t place, for it is evident that tho&s;e who are of a Wrathful temper are mo&s;t inclinable to <HI>Ra&s;h</HI> &amp; <HI>Prophane</HI> Swearing. Their Choler &s;upplies them with this Helli&s;h Rhetorick, and they never more abound with it than when they are Incen&s;ed and enraged. Therefore it is your concern to nouri&s;h <HI>Meekne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Patience,</HI> and to promote in your &s;elves a quiet and pla|cid temper, and to bani&s;h from your brea&s;ts all undue Anger, that it may not become the fuel of this Vice.</P>
<P N="9"><PB N="270" REF="039825_0277_10148DF15ED18E90">&sect;. 9. Again, <HI>Drunkenne&s;s</HI> is another Occa&s;ion of this wicked Practice, as is too frequently ob&s;er|ved. The Clubs of the Debauched and Intem|perate ring aloud with this Cur&s;ed Noi&s;e. It is as 'twere natural to tho&s;e who con&s;tantly inflame them&s;elves with Wine to be guilty of this di&s;or|der, becau&s;e then they have no guard upon their lips, &amp; their Tongues u&s;ually are as di&s;tempered as their Brains. So that it will be ab&s;olutely re|qui&s;ite, in order to your not being liable to this fault, to abhor all Exce&s;s in Drinking, and to ad|dict your &s;elves to Moderation and Temperance, and to keep your &s;elves always Cool and Sober. <HI>Gaming</HI> is another Incentive to this Sin, accord|ing to that old &s;aying, <HI>a Game&s;ter is pre&s;umed to Cur&s;e &amp; Bla&s;pheme.</HI> It is an E&s;&s;ential part of the Character of &s;uch a man, that he is given not only to Lying, but Swearing and For-&s;wearing. Wherefore let no Temptation prevail with you at any time to comply with this Unlawful and Scandalous practice.</P>
<P N="10">&sect;. 10. Moreover, that you may not be in|fected with this deadly Poi&s;on, carefully avoid the Company of tho&s;e that are. For the Society of Swearers is Contagious, &amp; will certainly have a Fatal influence upon you if you joyn your &s;elves to them. Therefore firmly re&s;olve to keep always at a di&s;tance from them, and never to have Com|munion with any that are addicted to this Pro|phane&s;s. La&s;tly, let me add this, be careful that you rehear&s;e not other mens Oaths. This is a fault in many, who though they will &s;eldom or never &s;wear them&s;elves, yet they will not refu&s;e to repeat other mens Swearing. But this may in time prove an Occa&s;ion of Greater Evil: by ex|pre&s;&s;ing
<PB N="271" REF="039825_0278_10148DF2F6198C60">
the impious words of others, they may come at la&s;t to imitate them. Be very cautious then in this particular: be not ea&s;ily induced to pronounce expre&s;&s;ions that were evil in the fir&s;t uttering; e&s;pecially if they be Oaths, take them not into your mouths: for whil&s;t you Repeat and Recite others unnece&s;&s;ary &amp; prophane Swearing, you make it your own, and will in time learn to do the &s;ame.</P>
<P N="11">&sect;. 11. Thus you &s;ee what <HI>Ungodline&s;s</HI> is as it hath reference to our words and Speeches: and I need not add that it is our Indi&s;pen&s;able Duty to Hate and Shun every part of it. Nor is this enough, for we are to promote the oppo&s;ite prac|tices both in our &s;elves and others. We mu&s;t not only never venture to be &s;o impious as to invoke the Sacred Name of the mo&s;t High in prophane Wi&s;hes and Execrations, but we are to ob&s;erve that injunction of the Apo&s;tle, <HI>Ble&s;s and Cur&s;e not,</HI> Rom. 12.14. We mu&s;t not only hate all Ra&s;h and vain Swearing in common di&s;cour&s;e and ordinary Communication, which is the fa&s;hiona|ble vice of this prophane Age; but whenever we have a lawful call to &s;wear before a Magi&s;trate, we mu&s;t be very careful to <HI>&s;wear in Truth, in Judgment, and in Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> Jer. 4.2.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of taking a &s;olemn Oath.</NOTE> The taking of an Oath ought to be a matter of Con&s;ci|ence with us, and not to be done out of Cu&s;tom or ill De&s;ign.</P>

Religious and Holy Life, whereby we oblige our &s;elves in a mo&s;t Sacred manner to adhere to God and our Duty, and e&s;pecially to &s;ome particular part of it. As the making of the&s;e Vows to God is a great help to Godline&s;s, &s;o it is a part of it, and is due from us to God, when there is occa&s;ion for it. When we find our &s;elves very much en|clined to &s;hrink from our duty, we are to make u&s;e of this as a Remedy again&s;t our Incon&s;tancy; we are by this means to &s;ettle and e&s;tabli&s;h our &s;elves in the practice of Holine&s;s, for it will be of great advantage to us to tye our &s;elves by a Sa|cred promi&s;e in the pre&s;ence of God to undertake and perform this or that particular Duty, or to for&s;ake this or that vice. For this we have the Example of the holie&s;t men: <HI>thus Job made a Covenant with his Eyes,</HI> Job. 31.1. That is, he bound him&s;elf by a Solemn Engagement &amp; Vow before God not to offend with his Bodily &s;ight. <HI>I have &s;worn,</HI> &s;aith the pious <HI>P&s;almi&s;t,</HI> that I will keep thy <HI>Righteous Judgments,</HI> P&s;. 119.106. He calls it Swearing becau&s;e there is a Solemn calling of God to witne&s;s in this Act of Religion, and therefore &s;o far it is of the nature of an Oath. We mu&s;t be exceeding careful that we Live and Act according to the tenour of the&s;e Solemn Pro|te&s;tations and Vows; or el&s;e we Increa&s;e our guilt by the breach of them Wherefore let us take up that re&s;olution in <HI>P&s;al</HI> 66.14 <HI>I will pay thee my vows which my lips have uttered.</HI> And &s;o as to all other Sacred Engagements and Oaths we mu&s;t Remember to keep them as Religiou&s;ly as we made them. <HI>Thou &s;halt perform unto the Lord thy Oaths, Mat.</HI> 5.33 And if we ob&s;erve not this, we Di&s;honour &amp; Prophane God's name

The &s;hort is, we are bound to make u&s;e of God's Name, and to mention his word and works, and all that belongs to him with Holy Fear and Re|verence: Religion mu&s;t &s;anctify and govern our Tongues: and all our Words &s;hould &s;avour of Pi|ety and Godline&s;s.

<P N="13">&sect;. 13. IV. <HI>Faith,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Faith its nature &amp; Acts.</NOTE> which is indeed the Root of all <HI>Godline&s;s,</HI> and without which no man can plea&s;e God.

For Faith doth not enquire whether they be hard to be a&s;&s;ented to, but whether they be A&s;&s;erted and delivered by God him&s;elf; and being per&s;wa|ded of this, it readily believes them to be true; becau&s;e the Te&s;timony of God is Infallible, and therefore commands our A&s;&s;ent. An other act of Go&s;pel Faith is an hearty <HI>Approving</HI> of the Truths of the Go&s;pel, for it is an Act of the Will, as well as of the Under&s;tanding. Faith is therefore a &s;incere Accepting of Chri&s;t in that manner as he offer'd in the Go&s;pel, and as he hath &s;hewed him&s;elf in his di&s;tinct Offices of King, Prie&s;t, and Prophet. In true and &s;aving <HI>Faith</HI> is included a voluntary &s;ubmitting to all the Laws and Precepts of Chri&s;tianity, and &s;hewing our readine&s;s to practice them.

<P N="14">&sect;. 14. Both the&s;e are comprehended in that excellent definition of <HI>Faith</HI> which the Apo&s;tle gives us in <HI>Heb</HI> 11.1. <HI>Faith is the &s;ub&s;tance of things hoped for the evidence of things not &s;een.</HI> Where by <HI>the things not &s;een</HI> are meant all tho&s;e Spiritual and Divine things which are Revealed and Di&s;covered to us by God, and which the Sa|cred Writings treat of.

of the efficacy of our Saviour's meritorious Death, whereby our Redemptiom was wrought, and whereby a New Covenant, namely, that of Grace and Mercy &amp; Pardon was e&s;tabli&s;hed, and there|fore the Cup in this Sacrament is called the <HI>New Covenant in his Blood,</HI> Luk. 22.20. as much as to &s;ay, it is a Confirmation of all the Benefits and Advantages which are convey'd by the New Co|venant, &s;ealed with the Blood of Chri&s;t.

The words in the large&s;t Sen&s;e, may be meant of the whole extent and compa&s;s of Man's Life, &amp; his duration here in this World. In this mo&s;t comprehen&s;ive acceptation, <HI>The Time is &s;hort; For what is our Life? It is even a Va|pour that appeareth for a little time, and then vani&s;hes away,</HI> James 4 14. Or it may be meant of the particular &amp; peculiar Sea&s;ons of Man's Life, and of the time of his U&s;ing and Enjoying tho&s;e Things which are vouch&s;afed to him in this World, which is far &s;horter than Time in the Gro&s;s and Bulk, becau&s;e that other is but a parcel of this. Thus if we take a view of the particular Portions and Sea&s;ons of Time which are granted to us, we &s;hall fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d that they are very fading and tran&s;itory. Such is the time of Youth and Vigour, and &s;uch is that of Health and Strength: And &s;o the days of Pro&s;perity and outward Abundance prove very &s;hort to many: and perhaps the Opportunities of Grace and &s;piritual Good are &s;horte&s;t of all to &s;ome Per&s;ons.

What do they &s;ignifie to a Man that is dying, and pa&s;&s;ing into the in|fernal Flames? It is &s;uch a thought as this that

and are &s;et at oppo&s;ition to each other. Fir&s;t, they are ju&s;tly to be blamed who pretend to live <HI>Soberly</HI> and <HI>Righteou&s;ly,</HI> but take no care of be|ing <HI>Godly:</HI> Secondly, tho&s;e that make a &s;hew of living <HI>Godlily,</HI> but neglect <HI>Sobriety</HI> and <HI>Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> I will &s;peak of the&s;e di&s;tinctly.</P>
<P N="9">&sect;. 9. <HI>First,</HI> Some &s;eem to lead their Lives <HI>Soberly</HI> and <HI>Justly,</HI> but in the mean time neglect <HI>Godline&s;s.</HI> They run not into Intemperance, they are Cha&s;t, Mode&s;t, and Grave, they injure not their Neighbours, but carry them&s;elves very lov|ingly and obligingly toward all Men, but yet they wholly forget their Duty to God. The&s;e Men are to be reminded that Temperance, and Ju&s;tice, and loving their Neighbours, if they be devoid of <HI>Godline&s;s</HI> are but empty &amp; in&s;ignificant Names: They are but outward Shews and Appearances, and utterly de&s;titute of an inward Principle to actuate and guide them, &amp; to make them accep|table. For a Sen&s;e of God is the &s;pring of all due Behaviour rewards our &s;elves and others. Such then are gro&s;ly mi&s;taken who ima|gine that there is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o other Good but that wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> re&s;pects humane Righteou&s;ne&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sin and Danger of being Partial in Religion.</NOTE> and therefore they have no regard of any Duty to God.

If the Bo|dy be divided from the Head, or from the Heart, which are the &s;ources of Life and Action, what is it but a &s;en&s;ele&s;s Trunk, and an unactive Ma&s;s of Matter? In like manner if Men pretend to be Righteous, and yet are de&s;titute of this vital Prin|ciple of Godlines, it may be &s;aid of them as of the wanton Widow, <HI>They are dead whil&s;t they live,</HI> or, as it was &s;aid of the Church of <HI>Sardis, They have a name that they live,</HI> they have &s;ome &s;hew and appearance of Spiritual Life, but they are really dead. Acts of Sobriety, and Ju&s;tice, and Hone&s;ty &s;eparated from Piety are mere Car|ka&s;&s;es of Religion: But then they may be &s;aid to have Life put into them when they i&s;&s;ue from and are grounded upon our Duty to God, and when they all refer to this: For we mu&s;t do them all for God's &s;ake: In the performing of them we mu&s;t di&s;charge our Con&s;ciences towards him, we mu&s;t make him our principal Object &amp; ultimate end in them: Briefly, we mu&s;t &s;erve and honour him by them. Wherefore this reproves, and at the &s;ame time baffles the Folly of tho&s;e Per&s;ons who place all their Religion in the Second Table, and per&s;wade them&s;elves that if they live tempe|rately and &s;oberly, and give every Man his own, they are compleat Chri&s;tians, and they &s;hall be excus'd tho' they deny God his due.

What will it avail you to have Bibles by you, and to be able to turn very dexterou&s;ly to Chapter &amp; Ver&s;e, &amp; thence to inform your &s;elves of your Duty in all kinds, if you perform it not? What will it profit you to under&s;tand the Doc|trines contained in that holy Book, if you di&s;cover nothing of them in your Lives? What will it ad|vantage you to Di&s;cour&s;e of tho&s;e excellent Truths, unle&s;s you practice the Contents of them?

O LORD, give us Help from Trouble, for vain is the Help of Man. Let the Cries and Supplications of thy Servants, who are calling upon Thee in this Day of <HI>Ja|cob</HI>'s Trouble, be Graciou&s;ly heard by Thee. Thou would&s;t have &s;pared <HI>Sodom,</HI> if Ten Righte|ous Men had been found in it.

Wilt Thou not give Ear to the Prayer &amp; Petitions of the&s;e thy Servants, and abate thine Anger and Di&s;plea&s;ure towards us, and remember thy wonted Mercies to this Nation?

<P>It is true, O LORD, we have been a Stubborn and Rebellious People, a People that &s;et not their Heart aright, and who&s;e Spirit is not &s;tedfa&s;t with Thee.

And therefore Thou may&s;t ju&s;tly &s;end thy Plagues and Judgments among us: Thou may&s;t de&s;ervedly puni&s;h us yet &s;even times more for our Iniquities.

We have tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed a|gain&s;t Greater Light, and more Abundant Mer|cy, than other Nations; and therefore we may expect to be puni&s;hed more than others.

to reflect on his pa&s;t Life, and to &s;urvey all the Actions of it. Repre&s;ent unto him all his for|mer Failings and Offences, that he may &s;eriou&s;ly and heartily bewail them, before he goes hence and be no more &s;een. Let him call to mind his Sins of Omi&s;&s;ion and Commi&s;&s;ion, his &s;ecret and open Sins, his Sins again&s;t the <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> and again&s;t the <HI>Second Table</HI>; his Sins which were more im|mediately committed again&s;t Thee, and tho&s;e al|&s;o which were directly committed again&s;t his Brethren and Neighbours, and again&s;t him&s;elf.

Let it grieve him at the Heart, that he hath offended &s;o Merciful a God, &s;o Kind a Benefactor, &s;o Loving a Father. And let his Grief and Remor&s;e proceed from an inward Hatred of all Sins; Namely, becau&s;e they are contrary to thy Holy Nature, and are a Violation of thy Ju&s;t and Righteous Laws. Work in him a firm Pur|po&s;e and Re&s;olution, never to commit tho&s;e Sins again which he now &s;tands guilty of; but to live more circum&s;pectly for the Time to come, both towards God and towards Men. Give him an Eye of Faith to look up unto Je&s;us who &s;uffer'd on the Cro&s;s, and &s;hed his precious Blood to re|concile lo&s;t Sinners unto God. Enable thy Ser|vant to relye with a firm Faith and Confidence, on the Merits of his Crucified Lord. Let him

A&s;&s;i&s;t him therefore to depend intirely upon the Righteou&s;|ne&s;s and Satisfaction of this Ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer, and renouncing all Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Worthine&s;s of his own, to confide wholly in the Meritorious Undertaking of this &s;potle&s;s Son of God. And let this Faith di&s;cover it &s;elf to be a True, &amp; Live|ly, and Saving Faith, by its working by Love, by Obedience to thy Will, by all the Fruits of Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, by a Holy and Exemplary Conver&s;ati|on. More e&s;epecially grant, that thy Servant may at this Time give a Proof of the Sincerity of his Faith, by &s;ubmitting and re&s;igning him&s;elf to thy Fatherly Correction. Give him Grace to &s;urren|der him&s;elf to thy Will and Plea&s;ure, whether it be in Life or Death. Suffer him not to murmur and repine at thy afflicting Hand, but teach him to embrace the Rod, patiently to yield to thy good Providence, and to &s;ay, It is the Lord; let him do what &s;eemeth him good. Cau&s;e thy Ser|vant to look back with Thankfulne&s;s, for all the Mercies and Ble&s;&s;ings which Thou ha&s;t from time to time con&s;er'd upon him. Let him call to mind all thy pa&s;t Mercies, from the beginning of his Life to this Moment. Spiritual and Temporal Mercies, Mercies to his Soul and to his Body, he ought to recount with a Thankful Heart, That Thou ha&s;t lengthned out his Life thus far, that Thou ha&s;t delivered him out of many Dangers and Perils, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ou ha&s;t not &s;natched him away in the Commi&s;&s;ion of his Sins, that Thou ha&s;t granted him Time and Space to repent in, &amp; that
