<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>PEACE is &s;o lovely in it&s;elf, and is &s;o e&s;&s;ential to happine&s;s, that all would be accounted friends there|to. The direction from above is, <HI>&s;eek peace and pur&s;ue it:</HI> and the cry from below is <HI>peace, peace!</HI> Yet there is a great and important difference be|tween the two languages; for the divine voice is, <HI>love the TRUTH and peace;</HI> and the way pre&s;cribed to promote <HI>union</HI> is, <HI>&s;peaking the TRUTH in love. Zech. 8.19. Eph. 4.15.</HI> But the two grand engines to &s;upport the contrary cau&s;e are <HI>deceit</HI> and <HI>violence.</HI> Which cau&s;e the Prince of <HI>peace</HI> came into the world on purpo&s;e to de&s;troy; and wherever his <HI>truth</HI> prevails, it breaks up that &s;ort of <HI>peace.</HI> Hence the charge exhibited again&s;t one of his greate&s;t mini&s;ters, by men of principal note in the world for religion and order, was, <HI>We have found this man a pe&s;tilent fellow, and a mover of &s;edition throughout the world. Acts 24.5.</HI> And it was not only &s;o among the <HI>Jews,</HI> but al&s;o in the capital of a <HI>Ro|man colony;</HI> when the power of truth had cut off the hope of an unlawful &s;cheme of <HI>gain,</HI> the <HI>magi&s;trates</HI> &s;oon had a complaint laid before them, that, <HI>the&s;e men do exceedingly trouble our city. Acts 16.20.</HI></P>
<P>However, this conduct both in <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Heathens,</HI> is &s;o plainly expo&s;ed in the bible, that the whole <HI>chri&s;tian world</HI> will condemn it; and who will dare to appear now to plead for a <HI>peace</HI> contrary to <HI>truth?</HI> In&s;tead of that, <HI>truth</HI> is &s;et upon as high a pole among <HI>prote&s;tants,</HI> as the <HI>cro&s;s</HI> is among the <HI>papi&s;ts</HI>: and every author that writes, has got the im|portant <HI>word</HI> wrote in &s;ome place, where the reader may not fail to &s;ee it. Yet the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> has been &s;uch <HI>galling of one ano|ther</HI> in <HI>perver&s;e di&s;puted</HI> and <HI>&s;triving</HI> about this and other <HI>words</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. 6.4, 5.</NOTE> in our day, that &s;ome &s;erious people are ready to condemn all <HI>di&s;puting,</HI> at being a principal cau&s;e of all the confu&s;ions that appear in our nation and land. Tho' if after the confu&s;ed noi&s;e, and garments rolled in blood, with the great perplexities which were produced by many <HI>defeats</HI> that we met with in the beginning of the late war, any had &s;aid,
<PB N="iv" REF="010823_0003_0F81D4693207F3F0">
we had better be <HI>ea&s;y</HI> as long as we can, than to oppo&s;e the enemy any more; &s;uch advice would hardly have pa&s;&s;ed for good policy, or for a token of true regard to our peace and welfare.</P>
<P>All rational attempts to remove calamities, are levelled again&s;t the cau&s;es of them; and as deceit and violence have been the cau&s;es of all our woes from the beginning, &s;o a great part of the work of God's &s;ervants in all ages has been to point out and expo&s;e the deceits of fal&s;e men; which has often pro|duced what the prophet &s;peaks of, viz. <HI>A voice of the how|ling of the &s;hepherds;</HI> and &s;ays he, <HI>my &s;oul loathed them, and their &s;oul al&s;o abhorred me. Zech. 11.3, 8.</HI> And things of like nature have appeared in our times, but none are willing to be accounted the <HI>idol &s;hepherds</HI>; each one would turn it off to others; and many mini&s;ters in our land have been labouring the&s;e <HI>20</HI> years to fix the odious character upon a number of people who have withdrawn from their &s;ocieties. Among whom Mr. <HI>Fi&s;h</HI> has lately di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf, by at|tempting to open the
<Q><HI>ri&s;e, cau&s;e and tendency</HI> of the&s;e &s;eparations and the errors of the anabapti&s;ts,</Q>
in a volume of about <HI>200</HI> pages. This I have been reque&s;ted by chri&s;tian friends to write &s;ome reply to; but as I have &s;everal times, expo&s;ed &s;ome of my thoughts on the&s;e &s;ubjects, to the world. I repeatedly told my friends that I thought I had done my part in that way. At length it was urged that many of the fir&s;t leaders in &s;eparation were gone off the &s;tage, and &s;carce any left that are &s;o fully acquainted with the circum&s;tances and manner of the fir&s;t &s;eparations, as I have been. This argument prevailed &s;o far, that I agreed to take and read the book and act as light might appear. And when I came to read it, no doubt remained whether it ought to be an&s;wer|ed or not, tho' the doing of it was far from appearing a plea&s;ing lot to nature. For whatever plea&s;ure it may yield, to appear to the public in matters that are plea&s;ing, or for a|mu&s;ement; yet in <HI>war,</HI> to be di&s;tingui&s;hed as a mark for every one to &s;hoot at, <HI>that</HI> nature dreads. My unequalne&s;s to the ta&s;k was &s;till a greater difficulty; for tho' it was an ea&s;y matter to point out many of Mr. <HI>Fi&s;h</HI>'s mi&s;takes and in|con&s;i&s;tences, &s;o as to render his performance contemptible; to do the &s;ubject ju&s;tice, would be nothing le&s;s than to lay open the religious <HI>con&s;titutions</HI> of the whole country, and many <HI>tran&s;actions</HI> which deeply affect the characters of many noted men.</P>
<P>Yet to omit it now, could not be done with a clear con|&s;cience; for Mr. <HI>F.</HI> &s;ays,
<Q>If I have in any in&s;tance, mi&s;|taken
<PB N="v" REF="010823_0003_0F81D4693207F3F0">
<HI>facts,</HI> or mi&s;repre&s;ented <HI>per&s;ons</HI> or <HI>things,</HI> I de&s;ire it may be corrected.</Q>
Preface p. <HI>4.</HI> And after a long di&s;cour&s;e on tho&s;e things, he &s;ays,
<Q>The foregoing <HI>errors, principles,</HI> and groundle&s;s <HI>offences</HI> which they took, the charge of all which mu&s;t lie upon them until they purge them&s;elves.</Q>
p. <HI>164.</HI> Therefore to be &s;ilent now, would be a letting many things pa&s;s for truth, which I knew were not &s;o, tho' many others did not know it. Mr. <HI>F.</HI> tells us he hopes, if there are any <HI>mi&s;takes,</HI>
<Q>it will be looked upon as &s;imple and unde|&s;igned.</Q>
To which I would &s;ay, I de&s;ire always to avoid the evil of judging the <HI>coun&s;els</HI> of others <HI>hearts,</HI> and to judge righteou&s;ly according to what is made manife&s;t. But as he has manife&s;ted that he has <HI>mi&s;took</HI> the <HI>rule it&s;elf,</HI> throughout his book, I leave him and others to con&s;ider how <HI>&s;imple</HI> or <HI>un|de&s;igned</HI> &s;uch a <HI>mi&s;take</HI> can be; or what le&s;s can be expected than fal&s;e actings upon a fal&s;e rule. Three witne&s;&s;es are allowed to prove any point, both by divine and human law: and that number &s;hall &s;uffice for the pre&s;ent to prove that he has mi&s;took, and acted contrary to the <HI>golden rule</HI> in the af|fair before us.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>1.</HI> No man, or community can think it rea&s;onable to have their character drawn only by their <HI>imperfections</HI> with|out any of their <HI>vertues:</HI> yet Mr. <HI>F.</HI> after a long attempt to draw the &s;eparates "picture to the life," &s;ays,
<Q>Whatever <HI>good things</HI> they have among them, they have them not <HI>as &s;eparates,</HI> but in <HI>common</HI> with other chri&s;tians. The things that I have told you of above, are their <HI>characteri&s;|ticks.</HI></Q>
p. <HI>160.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><HI>2.</HI> None can be willing to have the character of their whole denomination taken from evil per&s;ons and things which may be pickt out among them: yet in the mid&s;t of this labour to draw our picture, he &s;ays,
<Q>I would not here be under|&s;tood to repre&s;ent them <HI>all</HI> to a man, as advancing and <HI>uniting</HI> in every <HI>one</HI> of the particulars above-mentioned; but <HI>&s;ome</HI> of them held <HI>one,</HI> &s;ome <HI>another.</HI></Q>
p. <HI>142.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><HI>3.</HI> No man can rationally be willing to be deprived of the liberty of hearing and judging for him&s;elf in important matters; nor to be condemned by others without a fair hear|ing; yet this is the very labour of Mr. <HI>Fi&s;h</HI>'s whole book; for a principal rea&s;on given for his writing it, in the fir&s;t page of his preface is, that
<Q>a con&s;iderable number, if not the greater part of his few remaining people, inadvertently fa|voured the &s;eparate teachers, <HI>&s;o far</HI> as to frequent their meetings.</Q>
And a &s;pecial article of advice, in the <HI>con|clu&s;ion</HI> is
<Q><HI>Go not after them nor follow them.</HI>&mdash;How
<PB N="vi" REF="010823_0004_0F81D469F485F7F8">
can you, with any good con&s;cience, after I have &s;hewn you from <HI>whence</HI> they aro&s;e, their <HI>principle, &s;pirit</HI> and <HI>ten|dency.</HI></Q>
p. <HI>191.</HI> Thus his whole drift appears to be to keep his people from hearing and judging for them&s;elves. And he has condemned us without a fair hearing: for ac|counts of our principles and practices have been publi&s;hed by various hands, and at different times for the&s;e <HI>18</HI> years; yet it does not appear thro' his whole book, that he has paid any regard to them, even &s;o much as to point out our mi&s;takes or incon&s;i&s;tencies, (as doubtle&s;s he might have found &s;ome &s;uch;) but the chief of what he has held forth to the world again&s;t us, is upon his own bare word.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e the chief thing which blinded him in the&s;e affairs, was a conceit of his <HI>good de&s;ign</HI> therein; for &s;peaking of "the grievous things" which he has written both again&s;t &s;e|parates and bapti&s;ts, he &s;ays,
<Q>Neither of which &s;hould I have meddled with, could I at this day, have &s;een how to plead the cau&s;e of the <HI>churches</HI> (that our brethren have &s;epara|ted from) which I believe to be the cau&s;e of God, with|out &s;hewing the <HI>younger</HI> and reminding the <HI>elder</HI> among my people, how and wherein <HI>this &s;acred cau&s;e</HI> has been injured.</Q>
Pref. p. <HI>4.</HI> Now 'tis no new thing for men under a &s;trong conceit that they are engaged in a <HI>good cau&s;e</HI> to put <HI>good</HI> meanings to <HI>bad</HI> actions of their own, and <HI>bad</HI> meanings to <HI>good</HI> actions of others; yea and to e&s;teem men's <HI>works</HI> for the <HI>per&s;ons</HI> &s;ake, in&s;tead of e&s;teeming the <HI>per&s;on</HI> highly for his <HI>work's</HI> &s;ake. And this temper will prompt men to think that <HI>evil</HI> don't belong to the <HI>&s;acred cau&s;e</HI> that they are in, and that <HI>good</HI> don't belong to the oppo&s;ite party, but are intruders on each hand; and they would attribute the <HI>evil</HI> among them&s;elves to others, and the good among others to them&s;elves. And is it not from hence that our author, when he is going to reckon up a catalogue of the <HI>evil</HI> of the times, &s;ays,
<Q>If the &s;eparates are not the <HI>only</HI> guilty per&s;ons, or not <HI>MORE</HI> guilty than <HI>&s;ome</HI> that <HI>pretend</HI> to be of the <HI>&s;tanding order,</HI> yet 'tis manife&s;t that the following di&s;|orders are owing <HI>chiefly</HI> if not <HI>entirely</HI> to the <HI>SEPARA|TIONS</HI>?</Q>
p. <HI>172.</HI> Ob&s;erve, 'tis only <HI>&s;ome,</HI> and they but <HI>pretenders</HI> to be of the <HI>&s;tanding order</HI> who are allowed to be <HI>guilty,</HI> while the real guilt is laid <HI>chiefly</HI> if not <HI>entirely</HI> at the <HI>&s;eparates</HI> doors. On the other hand he &s;ays,
<Q>I know not of one <HI>principle</HI> or <HI>practice,</HI> among them that is agreeable to the go&s;pel, but what they learned in <HI>our churches.</HI></Q>
p. <HI>113.</HI> This is a fine way indeed of treating mankind!</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="010823_0004_0F81D469F485F7F8">However I tru&s;t it will yet be made manife&s;t, that it was what God taught us by his word and &s;pirit, of the <HI>corrupti|ons</HI> which are <HI>allowed,</HI> yea and pleaded for to this day, <HI>in</HI> tho&s;e churches that cau&s;ed us to &s;eparate from them. But as it &s;eems beneath the dignity of the&s;e learned gentlemen to take notice of <HI>laymen's</HI> writings, I would, to help Mr. <HI>F's</HI> eye-&s;ight a little, ju&s;t point him to one who calls him a <HI>layman</HI> as he does us; and who has got a <HI>title</HI> as much above him, as he has above us. He has only the title of <HI>reverend,</HI> but one who has the &s;hocking title given him of <HI>reverend Father in God,</HI> preached a &s;ermon on <HI>Feb. 21. 1766,</HI> before the <HI>&s;ociety</HI> which &s;upports the <HI>church mini&s;ters</HI> that are &s;ent in|to this country; wherein he declares that '<HI>PERSECUTION</HI> for <HI>OPINIONS</HI> was the <HI>mo&s;t abominable</HI> of all the errors of the <HI>antichri&s;tian</HI> church.' <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bi&s;hop of <HI>Gloce&s;ter</HI>'s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mon before &s;aid Society. p. 9.</NOTE> And his &s;ermon abounds with the word <HI>charity,</HI> and he allows that our fathers were driven into this land for <HI>con&s;cience &s;ake;</HI> yet &s;peaking expre&s;sly of tho&s;e colonies where <HI>pre&s;byteriani&s;m is e&s;tabli&s;hed,</HI> and <HI>re|mains</HI> in its <HI>ancient PURITY,</HI> he &s;ays,
<Q>That very people, who&s;e fathers were driven for con&s;cience &s;ake into the <HI>wa&s;te howling wilderne&s;s,</HI> are now as ready to laugh at the bible, as at their fathers ruffs and collarbands.</Q>
<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Page 12, 13.</NOTE> Here is a <HI>character</HI> given to the world of Mr. <HI>Fi&s;h's</HI> chur|ches, by one who &s;tands &s;o much above them, that he treats them ju&s;t as the&s;e mini&s;ters do us, namely to <HI>accu&s;e</HI> without any <HI>proof</HI> but great <HI>&s;welling words</HI> of their own. And this very accu&s;ation from the bi&s;hop, is given as the rea&s;on of their continuing their labours among us, in&s;tead of going on to go&s;pelize the <HI>&s;avages,</HI> which he allows to be the original de|&s;ign of that <HI>&s;ociety:</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Page 8.</NOTE> for he &s;ays,
<Q>We might well leave the&s;e factious people to them&s;elves, did not a mi&s;erable cir|cum&s;tance &s;till call for our rejected <HI>charity;</HI> I mean, the &s;preading of <HI>GENTILISM</HI> in the colonies them&s;elves.</Q>
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Page 11.</NOTE></P>
<P>And if we were to judge by his account it might be thought that &s;uch <HI>heatheni&s;m</HI> abounded the mo&s;t in <HI>Connecticut</HI> of any part of the land; for by the li&s;t of their <HI>mi&s;&s;ionaries</HI> at the end of the bi&s;hop's &s;ermon, it appears that they have a <HI>third</HI> more of them there, than in any other colony in <HI>America:</HI> tho' it looks more rational to me to &s;uppo&s;e that the clegy's power being carried to the highe&s;t pitch there, is the cau&s;e of it. This prelates conduct in this matter has been ju&s;tly com|plained of as an open violation of the laws of truth and equity; yet if he were allowed our authors method, to claim all that
<PB N="viii" REF="010823_0005_0F81D46AB96B8620">
is good among us to his &s;ide, becau&s;e our fathers came out of the church of <HI>England</HI>; then he might po&s;&s;ibly find <HI>&s;ome</HI> &s;uch per&s;ons in <HI>New-England</HI> as he &s;peaks of, tho' likely he might find ten to one of that character in his own <HI>dioce&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>The common name that his charity prompts him to give di&s;&s;enters in that &s;ermon is <HI>fanaticks.</HI> Now I &s;uppo&s;e a proper definition of that name is, that 'tis one who is <HI>puft up</HI> with a <HI>fancy</HI> that he has got &s;ome <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ew di&s;covery</HI> to make to others. And if &s;o, what &s;hall we think of the bi&s;hop of <HI>Gloce&s;ter?</HI> for he gives it in his &s;ermon as a <HI>new di&s;covery</HI> which he had made, that the <HI>&s;avages</HI> ought to be <HI>civilized</HI> as well as <HI>chri&s;tianized;</HI> and he attributes their little &s;ucce&s;s in times pa&s;t, chiefly to the want of knowing, or want of attend|ing to that maxim. Whereas to have told the plain truth, he mu&s;t have informed his honorable audience, that the rea&s;on why they had done &s;o little to chri&s;tanize the <HI>Indians,</HI> was be|cau&s;e they had &s;pent almo&s;t all their labours among the <HI>En|gli&s;h,</HI> and in the mo&s;t <HI>wealthy</HI> places that they could get footing in. And if he could have &s;tooped &s;o low as to have looked into the life of Mr. <HI>John Eliot</HI> in the la&s;t century, and the life of Mr. <HI>David Brainerd</HI> in this, he would have found, (that in&s;tead of a <HI>new di&s;covery</HI>) the very <HI>maxim</HI> he &s;peaks of was known and acted upon, both in the pa&s;t and pre&s;ent age, by the mo&s;t zealous and mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful labourers to bring the <HI>Indians</HI> to true chri&s;tianity, that <HI>America</HI> ever &s;aw.</P>
<P>The bi&s;hop proceeds to charge the <HI>coloni&s;ts</HI> with the dread|ful crime of yearly <HI>&s;tealing &s;laves</HI> from the oppo&s;ite continent, and <HI>&s;acrificing</HI> of them
<Q>to their great idol the <HI>GOD OF GAIN.</HI></Q>
p. <HI>25.</HI> And he &s;ays,
<Q>Nothing is more certain in it&s;elf, and apparent to all, than that the infamous traf|fic for &s;laves, directly infringes both divine and human law. <HI>Nature</HI> created man free, and <HI>grace</HI> invites him to a&s;&s;ert his freedom.</Q>

A profe&s;&s;ed mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t, at the head of a &s;ociety, compo&s;ed of the chief <HI>dignitaries of the church,</HI> and of &s;everal lords in the <HI>&s;tate,</HI> after exclaiming again&s;t per&s;ecution, <HI>charac|teri&s;eth</HI> the <HI>coloni&s;ts</HI> as <HI>fanaticks, factious gentiles,</HI> yearly practi&s;ing the wor&s;t of <HI>heatheni&s;m,</HI> even the <HI>&s;acrificing</HI> of <HI>human</HI> creatures to an <HI>idol;</HI> and this from the &s;ame truth that tells of <HI>pious de&s;igns</HI> in <HI>all</HI> the proceedings of his <HI>own party,</HI> and that charges it as <HI>impiety,</HI> even to <HI>&s;u&s;pect</HI> their <HI>per&s;everance</HI> therein! <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">And all this to move people to contribute money to that Society&punc; yet church-men have as great a hand in the &s;lave-trade as any.</NOTE> <HI>But thinke&s;t thou, O man, that judge&s;t them that do &s;uch things, and do&s;t the &s;ame, that thou &s;halt e&s;cape the judgment of God?</HI></P>
<P>Perhaps &s;ome are ready to cry, Who is this, that pre&s;umes to correct bi&s;hops and mini&s;ters at &s;uch a rate? An&s;wer, he is a per&s;on of very little note in the learned world, and never was a member of their &s;chools. Indeed they have given him a few titles; as &s;ometimes he has been of a <HI>credible family,</HI> and &s;o it was wondered at that he would go with &s;uch a de&s;picable people; yet anon he was pronounced a <HI>young up&s;tart,</HI> not to be regarded. One &s;entence decla|red him to be a <HI>crafty deceiver</HI>; the next an <HI>hone&s;t gump|head.</HI> Sometimes 'twas a&s;&s;erted that he was pur&s;uing <HI>worldly gain;</HI> and at another time they declared that he had little or nothing for his labour, and &s;pent his own e&s;tate: but <HI>neither &s;o did their witne&s;s agree together.</HI></P>
<P>The truth is, what little he does know, was gained in the &s;chool which Dr. <HI>Franck</HI> &s;peaks of, where the highe&s;t wi&s;|dom is, to <HI>know Je&s;us Chri&s;t and him crucified;</HI> and wherein things are taught in an <HI>experimental</HI> way. Hence the reader will find &s;everal le&s;&s;ons in the en&s;uing pages, repeated in that manner: and tho' he is not in&s;en&s;ible that <HI>telling of experience,</HI> is treated with contempt by the fa&s;hion|able chri&s;tians of our day, yet he is not daunted at their &s;neers, while he &s;ees the chief apo&s;tle of the <HI>circumci&s;ion</HI> taking this method to &s;atisfy his brethren; and the great apo&s;tle of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> doing the &s;ame before his learned per&s;ecutors, when they were complained of, for leaving the <HI>cu&s;toms of their fathers,</HI> Acts <HI>11.4&punc;&mdash;18.</HI> &amp; <HI>22.1&mdash;21.</HI> One &s;pecial order of that &s;chool is,
<Q>Have no fellow&s;hip with the unfruitful <HI>works of darkne&s;s,</HI> but rather <HI>reprove them.</HI> But all things that are <HI>reproved,</HI>
<PB N="x" REF="010823_0006_0F81D46BD78623F8">
are made <HI>manife&s;t</HI> by the <HI>light.</HI></Q>
This he takes to be a &s;ufficient warrant for improving a fair opportunity to at|tempt to hold up light to his fellow men, and to labour to convince all he can, be they ever &s;o much above him, where|in they have mi&s;took darkne&s;s for light; and he expects the &s;ame from others.</P>
<P>He would be far from repre&s;enting Mr. <HI>Fi&s;h</HI> as <HI>&s;ingular</HI> in what he has now publi&s;hed. No, his &s;ermons are a proper <HI>&s;pecimen</HI> of what has often been delivered from pul|pits in our land, for more than <HI>20</HI> years; and being per|&s;uaded that many worthy men, both in public and private &s;tations, have not known the true &s;tate of the&s;e affairs, therefore the author was induced to enlarge more upon them, than his love of brevity would otherwi&s;e have permit|ted. And may we all &s;o &s;peak and &s;o hear and do, as they that &s;hall be judged by the law of liberty.</P>

<HEAD>The Introduction. Containing &s;ome brief Remarks upon the <HI>Characters</HI> which Mr. <HI>Fi&s;h</HI> gives of a Church of Chri&s;t.</HEAD>
<P>_THOSE who de&s;ire to bring any controver&s;y to a ju&s;t i&s;&s;ue, will endeavor to hold up what light they can, concerning the merits of the cau&s;e, and not amu&s;e or perplex others minds with things foreign from the things in hand: therefore, as Mr. <HI>Fi&s;h</HI> begins his preface with this informa|tion, that
<Q>The &s;pecial occa&s;ion of the following di&s;cour&s;es was, the revival of the &s;pirit and principles of <HI>&s;eparation</HI> and <HI>anababti&s;m</HI>;</Q>
I &s;hall endeavor, according to the light I may be favoured with, to attend clo&s;ely to the&s;e points, and &s;hew wherein the difference between us lies, and the grounds of that difference.</P>
<P><Q>I heartily concur with him that the <HI>truth</HI> which <HI>Peter</HI> confe&s;&s;ed, or the per&s;on of Chri&s;t, of whom this confe&s;&s;ion is made, <HI>is the rock,</HI> upon which Je&s;us Chri&s;t re&s;olves to build his church;</Q>
and that <HI>Peter</HI> was
<Q>one of tho&s;e <HI>lively &s;tones,</HI> or precious materials of that building.</Q>
page 3. But I can't &s;ay &s;o of &s;ome of the <HI>characters</HI> which he gives to de&s;cribe the church of Chri&s;t by; the fir&s;t of which is,</P>
<P><Q>That Je&s;us Chri&s;t has but one church in the world, and that it is the <HI>&s;ame which it always was.</HI></Q>
To ex|plain which he &s;ays,
<Q>We gentile believers were graffed in among the Jewi&s;h believers, making one church. As the apo&s;tle Paul &s;hews, <HI>Rom.</HI> 11.17. And the whole is but the continuation of the &s;ame church, from the be|ginning of the world.</Q>
p. 6.7. It is readily granted that the <HI>invi&s;ible</HI> church is always the &s;ame; but that is not what Mr. F. intends: for he has ju&s;t before &s;aid,
<Q>I mean to &s;peak of Chri&s;t's <HI>vi&s;ible Church</HI> upon earth.&mdash; which contains both good and bad, true believers and nominal.</Q>
And his <HI>&s;ixth charctter</HI> of the church is only an explanation of this: which is, that
<Q>The church of
<PB N="12" REF="010823_0007_0F81D46C29DD1A20">
Chri&s;t has always con&s;i&s;ted of vi&s;ible believing parents and their children bound together by covenant to be the Lords.</Q>
p. 22. And after &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e upon <HI>A|braham's</HI> covenant he &s;ays,
<Q>Hence it appears that believ|ing parents cannot enter into <HI>that</HI> covenant which God made with <HI>Abraham,</HI> without taking their children with them.&mdash;They therefore that take God for their God, but not the God of their &s;eed, <HI>equally &s;o</HI>; they leave out <HI>half,</HI> or the <HI>greater part</HI> of the &s;ubjects of it.</Q>
p. 24, 25. He adds
<Q>If any &s;ay that this promi&s;e <HI>To thee and thy &s;eed after thee,</HI> under the go&s;pel, intends thy <HI>&s;eed</HI> or <HI>children</HI> when they are grown up, or be|come <HI>actual believers</HI>; and not while they are in a &s;tate of infancy, I apprehend the expo&s;ition will not &s;tand.</Q>
And after citing <HI>Deut.</HI> 29.10, &amp;c. he &s;ays,
<Q>Here you &s;ee, that great and &s;mall, parents and children, even little ones, &s;tand forth in a body, that they might all enter into (or renew) covenant with their God.&mdash;Which &s;hows that <HI>children,</HI> even <HI>infants</HI> were always reckoned a part of that <HI>body</HI> or <HI>church,</HI> which the Lord gathered in Abraham's family.</Q>
p. 25, 26.</P>
<P>Tis true that this was the con&s;titution of the church which was gathered in <HI>Abraham</HI>'s family, as appears from ver&s;e 13 which is, <HI>That he may e&s;tabli&s;h thee to day for a people unto him&s;elf, and that he may be unto thee a God, as he hath &s;aid unto thee, and as he hath &s;worn unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to I&s;aac, and to Jacob.</HI></P>
<P>But when Mr. <HI>Fi&s;h</HI> &s;ays,
<Q>Is it not altogether rea&s;on|able to &s;uppo&s;e that the chri&s;tian church is made up of the &s;ame materials that the jewi&s;h church was?</Q>
The an&s;wer mu&s;t be No, by no means; becau&s;e God has &s;aid the contrary; and 'tis perfect madne&s;s to &s;et up our <HI>&s;up|po&s;itions</HI> and <HI>rea&s;onings</HI> again&s;t divine revelation. Now that God has &s;aid the contrary, appears from <HI>Jer.</HI> 31.31, 32. Where he &s;ays,
<Q>Behold, the days come, &s;aith the Lord, that I will make a <HI>new covenant</HI> with the hou&s;e of <HI>I&s;rael; not according to the covenant</HI> that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand, to bring them out of the land of <HI>Egypt.</HI></Q>
Tho&s;e who &s;tood forth then as a body to enter into covenant, tho' they had &s;een great &s;igns and miracles; yet the Lord had not given them an <HI>heart to perceive, eyes to &s;ee,</HI> nor <HI>ears to hear,</HI> unto that day. But of this new covenant he &s;ays,
<Q>I will put my law in their <HI>inward parts,</HI> and write it in <HI>their hearts,</HI> and I <HI>will</HI> be their God, and they <HI>&s;hall</HI> be
<PB N="13" REF="010823_0007_0F81D46C29DD1A20">
my people; and they &s;hall <HI>all know me</HI> from the <HI>lea&s;t</HI> of them unto the <HI>greate&s;t</HI> of them, &s;aith the Lord.</Q>
The con&s;titution, prie&s;thood and ordinances of the jewi&s;h church, &s;erved unto the <HI>example</HI> and <HI>&s;hadow</HI> of heavenly things; but this is a <HI>better</HI> covenant which is e&s;tabli&s;hed upon <HI>better promi&s;es.</HI> That <HI>old</HI> covenant I&s;rael <HI>brake,</HI> and he <HI>regarded them not</HI>: But this <HI>new</HI> covenant is e&s;tabli&s;hed upon better promi&s;es, which are, <HI>I will,</HI> and <HI>they &s;hall. Heb.</HI> 8.5&mdash;13.</P>
<P>I cannot imagine that 'tis po&s;&s;ible for words to expre&s;s more plainly than the&s;e do, that there is an e&s;&s;ential diffe|rence between the <HI>materials,</HI> as well as the <HI>forms</HI> of the two churches; even the &s;ame that there is between &s;hadow and &s;ub&s;tance, fle&s;h and &s;pirit, type and antitype. All <HI>Abraham</HI>'s <HI>natural</HI> &s;eed were circumci&s;ed, and God &s;aid, <HI>my covenant &s;hall be in your fle&s;h</HI>; and all his &s;eed in a <HI>go&s;pel</HI> &s;en&s;e have the law written in their <HI>hearts,</HI> and their <HI>&s;ins</HI> &s;hall be <HI>remembered no more.</HI> Heb. 10.16, 17. Accor|dingly it was &s;uch as <HI>gladly received the word,</HI> and <HI>&s;uch as &s;hould be &s;aved,</HI> that were <HI>added to the church,</HI> in the apo&s;tles times, <HI>Acts</HI> 2. And when &s;ome of a contrary cha|racter got in, they are &s;aid to <HI>creep in unawares,</HI> Gal. 2.4. Jude 4. Therefore I think we may ju&s;tly return our au|thor's que&s;tion, and &s;ay,
<Q>Is it not altogether <HI>unrea&s;onable</HI> to &s;uppo&s;e that the chri&s;tian church is made up of the &s;ame materials the jewi&s;h church was, &s;ince the holy Gho&s;t has &s;o plainly declared the contrary?</Q></P>
<P>Having given a few of my thoughts upon Mr. <HI>Fi&s;h</HI>'s <HI>fir&s;t</HI> mark of a true church; and al&s;o of his <HI>&s;ixth</HI> which explained it, I come to his <HI>&s;econd,</HI> which is, that the churches "Foundation is one, and ever the &s;ame." p. 7. This is &s;trictly true of the invi&s;ible church, but the leaders of the vi&s;ible church when Je&s;us came, where <HI>builders</HI> who &s;et at nought this glorious <HI>corner-&s;tone</HI>; and he &s;hews that none build on the <HI>Rock</HI> but &s;uch as <HI>hear his &s;ayings and do them,</HI> Mat. 7.24. Faith cometh by hearing: and tho&s;e who hear and believe with their <HI>hearts,</HI> ought to confe&s;s with their <HI>mouths,</HI> and obey all Chri&s;t's commands, and thus they are <HI>built up for an habitation of God thro' the Spirit.</HI> In this &s;en&s;e I would join with him.</P>
<P>His <HI>third</HI> mark is, that
<Q>Chri&s;t Je&s;us was always the head and king of his church.</Q>
p. 9. So he is: and I heartily concur with him that our Lord Je&s;us
<Q>has done enough to make us tremble at the thoughts of attempting any
<PB N="14" REF="010823_0008_0F81D46D1C4DAE88">
thing, in his hou&s;e and wor&s;hip, which he has not directed us to do, much more any thing that he has forbidden.</Q></P>
<P>Our authors fourth character is,
<Q>Chri&s;t's church has always been furni&s;hed with officers of his appointing.</Q>
p. 11. Here again we agree in general truths; but when he comes to trace the order down from the beginning, why was his memory &s;o &s;hort as never to mention the <HI>prophets</HI> in the jewi&s;h church, while he enlarges upon the ca&s;e of the <HI>prie&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Levites</HI>? Perhaps he might think the latter would be&s;t agree with his notion of a <HI>line</HI> of <HI>&s;ucce&s;&s;ion</HI>; but he may find him&s;elf mi&s;taken there. For after the return of the <HI>Jews</HI> from <HI>Babylon,</HI> &s;ome of the children of the <HI>prie&s;ts,</HI> &s;ought their <HI>regi&s;ter</HI> among tho&s;e that were reckoned by <HI>genealogy,</HI> but they were not found: therefore they were, as <HI>polluted, put from the prie&s;thood.</HI> Ezra 2.62. Now if the power of ordination is not in the <HI>church,</HI> but is <HI>wholly</HI> committed to the <HI>mini&s;ters</HI> of the churches, as Mr. <HI>F.</HI> expre&s;ly holds (p. 80.145.) then, according to this plain example, every mini&s;ter who can't produce the <HI>regi&s;ter</HI> of his ordination, as being derived in an <HI>uninterrupted line</HI> down from the apo&s;tles, he ought as <HI>polluted</HI> to be <HI>put from the</HI> mini&s;try. And where will he and his brethren be then?</P>
<P>Indeed he would have us think that they have &s;uch a re|gi&s;ter where the very <HI>names</HI> of &s;uch a line is pre&s;erved. p. 18. But it &s;eems by the margin that 'tis in <HI>Latin,</HI> and as we are come out of the <HI>Latin</HI> church, we &s;hall expect to hear it in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> before we believe it. <HI>Paul's charge</HI> is not to give heed to <HI>fables and endle&s;s genealogies,</HI> which mini&s;ter <HI>que&s;t|ions,</HI> rather than <HI>godly edifying.</HI> 1 Tim. 1.4. And how fully have the&s;e words been verified in the di&s;putes which <HI>catholics, prelates,</HI> and <HI>pre&s;byters</HI> have had upon this affair the&s;e many hundred years? and it &s;till mini&s;ters <HI>que&s;tion</HI> which are as much unre&s;olved, as when they began the di&s;pute.</P>
<P>Our author's <HI>fifth</HI> character is, that
<Q>The church of Chri&s;t is a confederate people, a people in vi&s;ible covenant with God and with one another,</Q>
p. 19. This is true, and &s;o is his <HI>&s;eventh,</HI> that 'tis
<Q>further known by &s;pecial ordinances which God hath given it,</Q>
p. 34. Tho' it ought to be remembred that the fal&s;e church hath covenants and ordinances as well as the true, only the true church endeavours to keep to the divine pattern; while the fal&s;e, adds inventions of her own. The&s;e are therefore by no means &s;o plain marks to di&s;tingui&s;h the true church as his <HI>eighth</HI> and la&s;t is; viz. that
<Q>Chri&s;t's church has always had,
<PB N="15" REF="010823_0008_0F81D46D1C4DAE88">
and always will have his holy &s;pirit dwelling in it.</Q>
p. 44. This is a great truth; for if one church as well as per&s;on, have not the <HI>Spirit of Chri&s;t,</HI> it is <HI>none of his.</HI> Thus I have given a little touch upon the <HI>characteri&s;tics</HI> which Mr. F. has given of the church: two of them I think are not true, in the others we agree in general, tho' when we come to ap|ply them the difference between us will more di&s;tinctly open in many particulars.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Part. I. The <HI>con&s;titution</HI> which Mr. <HI>F.</HI> pleads for, opened, and proved to be e&s;&s;entially different from the fir&s;t churches in this Country.</HEAD>
<P>When Mr. <HI>Fi&s;h</HI> comes to apply the&s;e characters, he, to prepare the way promi&s;eth &s;everal things, the &s;ub&s;tance of which are, That the rule is perfect, but the be&s;t of men are imperfect, &s;o that when they come with hone&s;t hearts to ap|ply divine rules, they differ &s;o widely in their opinions upon &s;ome modes of wor&s;hip, as to render it difficult, if not im|practicable for them to wor&s;hip harmoniou&s;ly together: which &s;hews the nece&s;&s;ity as well as grounds of mutal for|bearance, and &s;hould make us cautious how we give hard names. The&s;e are weighty con&s;iderations, and if they had continued with due weight upon his mind thro' his follow|ing di&s;cour&s;es, it would doubtle&s;s have prevented my troub|ling him in the affair; but &s;ince it has proved to be o|therwi&s;e, I will <HI>al&s;o give mine opinion</HI>; and then leave it with the reader to judge for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Our author fir&s;t applies his rules to tho&s;e which he calls <HI>&s;tanding churches,</HI> and he &s;ays,
<Q>We have &s;ufficient rea&s;on to be comfortably &s;atisfied that the&s;e churches are true churches of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</Q>
p. 78. As to their <HI>con&s;titution,</HI> he &s;ays,
<Q>They are in general of the <HI>congre|gational</HI> way; and altho' in many parts, particularly in this <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Connecticut.</NOTE> colony, they are for mutual benefit, <HI>con&s;ociated</HI> or united together by agreement, yet they remain <HI>con|gregational,</HI> p. 79.</Q></P>
<P>This title, as I under&s;tand, is derived from the fathers of this country, therefore we mu&s;t look there for its true meaning. Now <HI>Cambridge platform</HI> &s;ays, the church &s;ince the coming of Chri&s;t is
<Q>only congregational, therefore neither national, provincial nor cla&s;&s;ical.</Q>
National churches have their pari&s;hes, for managing the common affairs of their wor&s;hip, who yet are under the government of the whole: But the plan before us in expre&s;s di&s;tinction therefrom, has the whole power of church goverment in
<PB N="16" REF="010823_0009_0F81D46DA85DB998">
each particular church,
<Q>power to open and &s;hut, to chu&s;e and refu&s;e, to con&s;titute in office, and remove from office.</Q>
This is the expre&s;s meaning of the name, as it is explained by our fathers who gave it: And tho' they freely improved the advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of other chur|ches, yet it was <HI>&s;i&s;ters</HI> or <HI>equals,</HI> who &s;till had the whole right of government within each church.</P>
<P>And are the &s;tanding churches &s;uch? No, Mr. <HI>F.</HI> has not got two pages forward, before he lays down this as the fir&s;t thing which <HI>ought</HI> to be <HI>corrected</HI> in the churches, viz.
<Q>The impo&s;ition of hands at the ordaining of elders, which, &s;ays he, I apprehend the go&s;pel has committed <HI>wholly</HI> to the care of the <HI>pre&s;bytery,</HI> or <HI>mini&s;ters</HI> of the churches; but is by the indulgent <HI>Cambridge</HI> platform, di&s;po&s;ed of to the <HI>brethren,</HI> at the plea&s;ure of the church.</Q>
p. 80. Thus while he u&s;urps the name, be|cau&s;e 'tis credible, he denies a principal point in its meaning, and directly &s;ets up a power above the churches; for, if the power of ordination is not <HI>in</HI> the church, then &s;he mu&s;t be beholden to a power <HI>without</HI> her, and &s;o <HI>above</HI> her, to give her office-authority. But our fathers had &s;een too much of this &s;piritual tyranny, to be willing to come under it again; and as they knew that the <HI>church of the living God,</HI> is <HI>the pillar and ground of the truth,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. 3.15. John 3.9, 10.</NOTE> they re&s;ted the matter there, and de&s;ired with <HI>Timothy</HI> to behave as they ought, <HI>in the hou&s;e of God</HI>; but not like <HI>Diotrephes</HI> to love a <HI>pre-eminence over it.</HI> However Mr. <HI>F.</HI> would have it that their <HI>practice</HI> was not agreable to their <HI>principles,</HI> and &s;ays <HI>Plymouth</HI> church "attempted not to ordain a mini&s;ter merely as a church," of brethren only, with their own hands." p. 84. But Mr. <HI>Prince</HI> who knew as well as he, informs us con|cerning the fir&s;t church in <HI>Salem,</HI> that on <HI>Aug.</HI> 6. 1629.
<Q>They proceeded to <HI>ordain their</HI> mini&s;ters; as al&s;o Mr. <HI>Houghton</HI> a ruling elder; being &s;eparated to their &s;eve|ral offices by the impo&s;ition of the hands of &s;ome of the <HI>brethren</HI> appointed by the church thereto: Governor <HI>Bradford</HI> and others, as <HI>me&s;&s;engers</HI> from the church of <HI>Plymouth,</HI> being by cro&s;s winds hindred from being pre|&s;ent in the former part of the &s;ervice, came time enough to give them the <HI>right hand of fellow&s;hip.</HI></Q>

And the &s;ame author informs us in the next page, that one di&s;tingui&s;hing character of a congregational church is,
<Q>That there is no juri&s;diction to which particular churches are or ought to be &s;ubject, by way of authoritative cen&s;ure, nor any other <HI>church power,</HI> extrin&s;ical to &s;uch churches, which they ought to depend upon <HI>any other &s;ort of men</HI> for the exerci&s;e of.</Q></P>
<P>Here the point turns: We all hold it proper occa&s;ionally to improve the advice and gifts of other churches, while all are equal as to power: but all mini&s;ters who think they have a power to impart to another church, which that church has not within it&s;elf, and has not a right to exerci&s;e without a&s;&s;i&s;tance received from abroad; they are not congregational men, let them pretend what they will.</P>
<P>Another great point in the congregational plan is, that the "power to open and &s;hut," is in the church as a bo|dy; and therefore that they all ought to hear and judge of the evidence that any give of their right to be received as members. Dr. <HI>Increa&s;e Mather</HI> &s;ays,
<Q>There is <HI>no congregational</HI> man, but he <HI>reports to the church</HI> &s;ome|thing of what the per&s;on de&s;iring communion with them, has related to him; which the <HI>pre&s;byterian</HI> does not, only declares his own &s;atisfaction, and giveth the brethren a liberty to object again&s;t their conver&s;ation.</Q>
<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mitchel's Life. dedicat. p. 23.</NOTE> And he tells us, that in the declaration of the <HI>faith</HI> and <HI>order</HI> of the <HI>congregational churches</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> given at <HI>Savoy,</HI> Oct. 12. 1658.

<Q>That the
<PB N="18" REF="010823_0010_0F81D47153D83EF8">
members of particular churches are &s;aints by calling, vi&s;ibly manife&s;ting their obedience to the call of Chri&s;t, who being further known to each other, by their con|fe&s;&s;ion of &s;aith, wrought <HI>in them</HI> by the power of God, <HI>declared by them&s;elves,</HI> or otherwi&s;e manife&s;ted, con&s;ent to walk together according to the appointment of Chri&s;t.</Q>
The doctor further &s;ays,
<Q>It is evident, that the church (and not the officers only) have power given them by Chri&s;t to judge who are meet to be <HI>put out</HI> of their communion. Matt. 18.17. 1 Cor. 5.12. Then they mu&s;t needs have the like power as to tho&s;e that are to be <HI>taken into</HI> their communion.</Q>
And is this the way now of the churches Mr. <HI>F.</HI> pleads for? No, I never knew an in&s;tance in my day, of any who were admitted into any of tho&s;e churches, by declaring <HI>per&s;o|nally the &s;aith wrought in</HI> their &s;ouls; and a great part of them have now dropt even giving <HI>written relations.</HI></P>
<P>This leads us down to a third article of difference which is the root of all, namely, the <HI>matter</HI> of a go&s;pel church. We have already &s;een that Mr. <HI>F.</HI> &s;uppo&s;eth that the
<Q>chri&s;tian church is made up of the &s;ame <HI>materials</HI> that the jewi&s;h church was.</Q>
But the <HI>Cambridge</HI> platform expre&s;sly &s;ays,
<Q>The <HI>matter</HI> of a vi&s;ible church are &s;aints by calling, 1 Cor. 1.2. Eph. 1.1.</Q>
and that the church
<Q>under the law, was <HI>national,</HI> which &s;ince the coming of Chri&s;t is <HI>only congregational</HI>; therefore neither national, provincial nor cla&s;&s;ical.</Q>
Yet Mr. <HI>Fi&s;h</HI> has the face to tell the world that their
<Q>churches are, in general, pro|perly <HI>congregational.</HI></Q>
And then goes on to produce the te&s;timony of pre&s;ident <HI>Oaks</HI> in favour of that plan, as the "highe&s;t &s;tep that has been taken towards <HI>reformation</HI>;" to which he &s;ays,
<Q>The venerable Dr. <HI>Increa&s;e Mather</HI> adds the weight of his approbation,</Q>
p. 80. After which, a long quotation is produced from the doctor in favor of the <HI>college,</HI> from whence almo&s;t all the churches were &s;up|plied with mini&s;ters; yet he &s;topt a little too &s;hort at la&s;t; for that venerable author's next words are the&s;e, viz.
<Q>Nor are the churches like to continue <HI>pure golden can|dle&s;ticks,</HI> if the <HI>college,</HI> which &s;hould &s;upply them, prove <HI>apo&s;tate.</HI></Q>
And in the &s;ame book, he lets us know what he means by that dreadful name,
<Q>The deb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ing, &s;ays he, the <HI>matter</HI> of particular churches mu&s;t needs corrupt them. A learned and renowned author (i. e. Dr. <HI>Owen</HI>) has evidenced that the letting go this principle, that
<PB N="19" REF="010823_0010_0F81D47153D83EF8">
particular churches ought to con&s;i&s;t of <HI>regenerate per|&s;ons,</HI> brought in the great <HI>apo&s;tate of the chri&s;tian church.</HI> The way to prevent the like <HI>apo&s;tacy,</HI> (&s;ays Dr. <HI>Mather</HI>) in the&s;e churches, is to require an <HI>account</HI> of tho&s;e that offer them&s;elves to communion therein, concerning the <HI>work of God on their &s;ouls,</HI> as well as concerning their knowlege and belief.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mitchel's life. dedicat. p. 27. &amp; 16.</NOTE> And he tells us <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 10.</NOTE> that
<Q>Ble&s;&s;ed Mr. <HI>Mitchel</HI> would frequently a&s;&s;ert, that if it &s;hould pa&s;s for current doctrine in <HI>New-England,</HI> that all per&s;ons <HI>orthodox in judgment,</HI> as to matters of faith, not <HI>&s;canda|lous in life,</HI> ought to be admitted to partake of the Lord's &s;upper, without an examination, concerning the <HI>work of &s;aving grace in their hearts,</HI> it would be a real <HI>apo&s;tacy</HI> from former principles.</Q></P>
<P>And are mini&s;ters now of the&s;e &s;entiments? A worthy gentleman told me that he &s;at a number of years at <HI>Mar|blehead,</HI> under the mini&s;try of <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">He has been pre&s;ident of <HI>Harvard College</HI> this 30 years.</NOTE> Mr. <HI>Holyoke,</HI> before he was elected pre&s;ident of the &s;ame college that the&s;e words were directed to; and that his common method of admitting members into the church was without giving them any relation of experiences at all, either verbal or written; and that has now got to be a prevailing cu&s;tom in many parts of the country. Yet mini&s;ters pretend to be upon the &s;ame foundation with tho&s;e fathers. But here is a treble te&s;timony that they are <HI>apo&s;tates</HI> therefrom. And Dr. <HI>Increa&s;e Mather</HI> had &s;uch a view of its coming on, that he &s;aid in the year 1700, that
<Q>If the begun <HI>apo&s;tacy</HI> &s;hould pro|ceed as fa&s;t the next thirty years, as it has done the la&s;t, &s;urely it will come to that in <HI>New-England,</HI> (except the go&s;pel it&s;elf depart with the order of it) that the mo&s;t con&s;cientious people therein, will think them&s;elves con|cerned to <HI>gather churches out of churches.</HI></Q>
<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">See the preface to his vindication of the order of the churches in <HI>New-England.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>Now we may form &s;ome judgment how far this apo&s;ta|cy had proceeded, when our &s;eparation began, more than forty years afterwards, by a &s;ort of <HI>pa&s;toral letter,</HI> which all the mini&s;ters in <HI>Windham</HI> county publi&s;hed again&s;t us; wherein they &s;ay,
<Q>This notion of a pure church, as &s;e|parating the converted from the unconverted, is contra|ry to the revealed will of God. This is as evident as any thing can be by that way of evidence, in divers pa|rables of our Savior,</Q>
p. 20. The fir&s;t parable which
<PB N="20" REF="010823_0011_0F81D4720F00BA90">
they refer us to, is that of the <HI>tares of the field,</HI> in Matt. 13.24, &amp;c. And they &s;ay,
<Q>Our Savior explains it to his di&s;ciples, as you &s;ee from ver&s;e 37. Where he &s;ays, <HI>The field is the world</HI>; in which therefore is this king|dom of heaven. <HI>The good &s;eed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one.</HI> Both the one and the other are in the kingdom of heaven which is in this world, i. e. <HI>the vi&s;ible church,</HI></Q>
p. 21. And after giving their thoughts upon &s;everal other &s;criptures, they &s;ay,
<Q>There are many other texts which might be urged, and plainly &s;hew, that it is the will of Chri&s;t, that all tho&s;e who make an <HI>out|ward credible profe&s;&s;ion of chri&s;tianity,</HI> &s;hould be admit|ted into his church, and tho' <HI>unconverted be there</HI> among the wheat the honorable ve&s;&s;els, &s;o long as he has a church in the world, that they may be under proper ordinances for their conver&s;ion, and for the trial of his people, and their u&s;efulne&s;s to them, &amp;c.</Q>
p. 23.</P>
<P>I leave the reader to judge how near this doctrine comes to what Mr. <HI>Mitchel</HI> and other fathers call <HI>apo&s;tacy,</HI> and al&s;o how <HI>current</HI> this doctrine has pa&s;t, when the mini&s;ters of a whole county, have publi&s;hed it to the world; and world only remark here, that they have done like tho&s;e who formerly made <HI>void</HI> the divine command by their own <HI>traditions</HI>; for as they have contradicted our &s;aviour in ex|plaining the parable of the <HI>tares,</HI> and the <HI>field</HI> which he &s;ays is the <HI>world,</HI> they &s;ay is the <HI>church</HI>; &s;o they have made void his command in this very affair. His command is, <HI>Let both grow together</HI>: but their practice has &s;aid, No, they &s;hall not; for as &s;oon as any appear'd again&s;t their &s;chemes, they would not let them grow, nor enjoy their natural rights. Mr <HI>Finley,</HI> who has &s;ince been pre&s;ident of <HI>New Jer&s;ey</HI> college, happened to come in tho&s;e times to <HI>New-Haven,</HI> and only for his preaching to the &s;eparates there, he was taken up by civil officers and carried out of the colony; and tho&s;e who belong'd among us, that ven|tured publickly to improve their gifts without the mini&s;ters licence, were not &s;uffered to enjoy <HI>worldly</HI> privileges, but were taken up one after another, and ca&s;t into pri&s;on.

<PB N="21" REF="010823_0011_0F81D4720F00BA90">
practice became &s;o odious that none would buy &s;uch goods; and then they took to &s;eizing their per&s;ons. I have an ac|count before me of no le&s;s than <HI>eleven</HI> per&s;ons who were &s;eized thus and carried to jail in <HI>Norwich</HI> only in 8 months, after <HI>June</HI> 17, 1752. one of which was a <HI>widow</HI> 54 years old who belonged to another church, where &s;he attended, and did her part towards the &s;upport of divine wor&s;hip, ac|cording to her con&s;cience, and had no concern with the pari&s;h mini&s;ter; therefore &s;he did not think that the rate which was demanded for him was ju&s;t: yet for her refu|&s;ing to pay it, &s;he was taken, and, tho' a weakly woman was carried to pri&s;on in a dark rainy night. One told them then that it look'd like the <HI>works of darkne&s;s.</HI> But the chri&s;tian character &s;he bore, and the chri&s;tian temper which &s;he and others then di&s;covered, greatly weakened the cau&s;e they de&s;igned to promote hereby.</P>
<P>Not long after, a gentleman in the &s;ame place, was im|pri&s;oned for the &s;ame cau&s;e, while he &s;tood a repre&s;entative for the town, in the general court. About the &s;ame time a &s;ingle woman of a good character, in <HI>Raynham,</HI> was con|fined more than 12 months in <HI>Taunton</HI> goal, which the mi|ni&s;ter might have prevented by cro&s;&s;ing out, only an <HI>eight penny</HI> rate. At length the evidence &s;he gave of true <HI>con|&s;cientiou&s;ne&s;s</HI> in the matter, cau&s;ed &s;uch unea&s;ine&s;s among that mini&s;ter's own people, that they rai&s;ed money and went and &s;et her at liberty. This is but a little &s;ketch of what has been done of that nature, in various parts of our land.</P>
<P>If any &s;ay, Why are the&s;e odious things publi&s;hed now? I an&s;wer, <HI>Is there not a cau&s;e</HI>? When the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> complained a few years ago to the king of <HI>Spain,</HI> that many things were publi&s;hed again&s;t them, and de&s;ired him to for|bid it; his reply was,
<Q>The way not to have <HI>faults</HI> pub|li&s;hed, is <HI>not to commit them.</HI></Q>
The&s;e are often called, <HI>&s;tanding churches</HI>; therefore one de&s;ign of this is to &s;hew what they <HI>&s;tand upon</HI>; even the &s;ame that other <HI>national</HI> or <HI>provincial</HI> churches do,&mdash;<HI>civil authority.</HI> Hence, how often do they tell us, "That if it where not for the &s;upport of the civil powers, their churches would &s;oon be broken up?" And an author of great note has lately told the world that,
<Q>After all that may be &s;aid in favour of the <HI>con&s;titution,</HI> the <HI>&s;trength</HI> of it lay in the union de|clared with the civil authority.</Q>

<P>I am much obliged to his Honor for the ingenuous ac|count which he has given us of former times: yet I &s;hall take the liberty to &s;ay, that if he was not unaw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es, a little <HI>wedded</HI> to his own apprehen&s;ions, I hardly think he would have called this, a <HI>ju&s;t ob&s;ervation</HI>; for el&s;ewhere, &s;peaking of the te&s;ts which had been impo&s;ed by authority in both Englands to produce <HI>uniformity in religion,</HI> he &s;ays,
<Q>Both the one and the other mu&s;t have occa&s;ioned much <HI>formality</HI> and <HI>hypocri&s;y.</HI> The my&s;teries of our holy religi|on have been <HI>pro&s;tituted</HI> to mere <HI>&s;ecular views and advan|tages.</HI></Q>

<P>"The experience of all reformed churches," is appealed to for proof, that this <HI>coercive</HI> power is needful to keep the <HI>order of the go&s;pel</HI>: but the &s;ame appeal might more ju&s;tly be made, to prove that the clergy, when <HI>thus</HI> &s;up|ported, have been the mo&s;t tyrannical of all men; which has often &s;erved to harden infidels again&s;t all go&s;pel prea|chers. A plain rea&s;on why &s;uch men have been the mo&s;t tyrannical, is becau&s;e they claim authority, more immediate|ly from the <HI>higher</HI> power, than others do. Tho' civil authority is of divine appointment, as well as eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal; yet the highe&s;t civil rulers know, that they are &s;et up and &s;upported by men, while the others claim a com|mi&s;&s;ion from God.

a little further lay open my views of this affair; which are, that, as civil rulers ought to be men fearing God, and hating covetou&s;ne&s;s, and to be terrors to evil doers, and a prai&s;e to them who do well; and as mini&s;ters ought to pray for rulers, and to teach the people to be &s;ubject to them; So there may and ought to be a &s;weet harmony between them&punc; yet as there is a great difference between the nature of their work, they never ought to have <HI>&s;uch a union</HI> together, as was de&s;cribed above.</P>
<P>For, 1. The holy gho&s;t calls the orders and laws of civil &s;tates <HI>ordinances of man,</HI> 1 Pet. 2.13. But all the rules and orders of divine wor&s;hip are <HI>ordinances of God</HI>; and it <HI>defi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the earth under</HI> its <HI>inhabitants,</HI> when the&s;e <HI>laws</HI> are <HI>tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed,</HI> and <HI>ordinances changed.</HI> I&s;a. 24.5. And one of his laws is,
<Q>AS EVERY man hath received the <HI>gift, even &s;o</HI> mini&s;ter the &s;ame one to another, as good &s;tewards of the manifold grace of God. If <HI>any man &s;peak,</HI> let him &s;peak as the oracles of God; if <HI>any man mini&s;ter,</HI> let him do it as of the <HI>ability</HI> which GOD GIVETH: that GOD <HI>in all things may be glorified thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></Q>
1 Pet. 4.10, 11. But this law and or|der has been &s;o much <HI>changed</HI> in our land, that churches have not looked &s;o much at the <HI>ability</HI> which <HI>God</HI> has <HI>given,</HI> as to the <HI>titles</HI> which <HI>man</HI> has <HI>be&s;towed.</HI> I &s;ay <HI>titles,</HI> for many of their mini&s;ters have not <HI>gifts</HI> to deliver a &s;ermon without <HI>reading</HI>; notwith&s;tanding their <HI>name</HI> of being <HI>learned</HI> men. And yet it is called, the
<Q>order of the go&s;|pel,</Q>
now, to have &s;uch men's <HI>per&s;ons in admiration</HI> &s;o as not to chu&s;e any others into the mini&s;try, <HI>le&s;t man's glory &s;hould be brought down,</HI> while we are repre&s;ented as proud rebels, for not owning them as &s;uch.</P>
<P N="2">2. The civil magi&s;trates work is, to promote order and peace among men, in their moral behaviour towards each other, &s;o that every per&s;on among all denominations who doth <HI>that which is good</HI> may <HI>have prai&s;e of the &s;ame</HI>; and and that all contrary behaviour may be re&s;trained, or

forcibly puni&s;hed. And as all &s;orts of men are members of civil &s;ociety and partake of the benefits of &s;uch government, therefore they ought to be <HI>&s;ubject,</HI> and pay <HI>tribute</HI> to rulers. Rom. 13.1 &mdash;6.

<P>I &s;hall clo&s;e this head with this remark; that while Mr. <HI>F.</HI> &s;eems plea&s;ed with what he tho't would do great execution again&s;t us, he has unawares involved him&s;elf in a &s;ad <HI>dilem|ma</HI>: for if the ca&s;e be as I have repre&s;ented, he &s;tands a fair chance of falling among fal&s;e teachers: but if his &s;en&s;e of the text be right, he &s;hews a want of <HI>Paul</HI>'s temper, and in&s;tead of cutting off occa&s;ion of being called a hireling, he &s;till pleads up for that &s;cheme, which often extorts wa|ges from &s;uch as receive no &s;ervice from them, in|&s;tead of doing real &s;ervice without wages as <HI>Paul</HI> did. At the &s;ame time he endeavors artfully to blend a <HI>free</HI> &s;upport to mini&s;ters, and a <HI>forced</HI> one together; where|as there is as much difference between them, as there is between the power of truth in the mind, and the power of the civil &s;word on the body. The fir&s;t is abundantly clear in &s;cripture, the other has no warrant there.</P>
<P N="3">3. Another difference between civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical go|verment is, that civil &s;tates if large, have various degrees of offices one above another, who receive their authority thro' many hands, down from the head, and that often, more according to e&s;tate or favor, than merit: but 'tis the rever&s;e in Chri&s;t's kingdom; he forbid the fir&s;t notions of this in his di&s;ciples, and expre&s;sly told them that it <HI>&s;hould not be &s;o</HI> among them, as it was in earthly &s;tates, <HI>Mark</HI> 10.43. <HI>Luk.</HI> 22.26. An obvious rea&s;on of this difference is that an earthly king cannot in per&s;on &s;ee, to but littl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that is done in his kingdom, and therefore mu&s;t tru&s;t other to manage affairs for him in his ab&s;ence; but Zion's Kin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> is pre&s;ent every where, and &s;ees to all that is done, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> tells every church, <HI>I know thy works</HI>: and he takes ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that the faithful are &s;upported and rewarded, and that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> unfaithful are corrected or puni&s;hed.

<Q>civil government and a defen&s;ive war will &s;tand or fall together.</Q>
Hence Je&s;us &s;aid, <HI>If my kingdom were of this world, then would my &s;ervants fight, that I &s;hould not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.</HI> Joh. 18.36. Therefore the dignity of his government is maintained, not by <HI>carnal,</HI> but by <HI>&s;piritual</HI> weapons: and not by <HI>re&s;i&s;ting,</HI> but pati|ently <HI>bearing</HI> evil treatment. Hence when one of his chief officers was greatly abu&s;ed he &s;aid, <HI>Being reviled, we ble&s;s: being per&s;ecuted, we &s;uffer it: being defamed, we intreat: we are made the filth of the world, and are the off-&s;couring of all things unto this day.</HI> 1 Cor. 4.12.13. And the way in which the &s;aints finally obtain victory over the <HI>dragon</HI> and <HI>his angels</HI> is, <HI>by the blood of the lamb, and the word of their te&s;timony; and not loving their lives unto the death.</HI> Rev. 12.11.</P>
<P>I have been the more particular on the&s;e things, be|cau&s;e the core of our difficulties lies here. And if the kind reader finds here but an imperfect de&s;cription of the way of the churches acting upon truth, in di&s;tinction from all earthly powers, let him remember that this is a <HI>high|way</HI> that has been very much <HI>unoccupied</HI> in later ages, and men have gone in <HI>by ways:</HI> but 'tis hoped that this <HI>good old way</HI> will &s;peedily be opened &s;o plainly that <HI>fools &s;hall not err therein</HI>: and if this weak attempt may be owned as any means thereof, that will over-balance all the world's reproaches on that account. The confounding of civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs together has done amazing mi&s;chief in the world: and as Dr. <HI>Cotton Mather</HI> ob&s;erves
<Q>The reforming churches flying from <HI>Rome,</HI> carried &s;ome of them more, &s;ome of them le&s;s, all of them &s;omething of <HI>Rome,</HI> with them, e&s;pecially in that &s;pirit of impo&s;i|tion and per&s;ecution, which has too much cleaved unto them all.</Q>
This was the wor&s;t mi&s;take that our fathers brought with them to this land; &amp; tho' their po&s;terity will generally explode tho&s;e bitter <HI>fruits</HI>; yet few of them &s;eem to be &s;en&s;ible of the <HI>root</HI> from whence they &s;prang. What our Lord &s;aid of &s;erving two ma&s;ters, may in &s;ome &s;en&s;e be applied to the joining of the&s;e two powers toge|ther; one or the other will carry the day, and they have each had their turns in our land.

charter, none could be &s;o much as <HI>freemen</HI> in the &s;tate, till they were members of the church; and &s;uch as afterwards fell under church-cen&s;ure were not allowed to &s;it in the court. And &s;truggles on the&s;e points were a principal cau&s;e of loo&s;ing that charter. But now the &s;cale is &s;o far turned, that 'tis a profe&s;&s;ed rule with many mini|&s;ters, not to deal with any per&s;on in the church for moral evil, 'till they are convicted in the &s;tate. A great turn indeed!</P>
<P>As nearne&s;s tends to beg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t likene&s;s, &s;o there have been &s;everal attempts made in our land, to e&s;tabli&s;h various de|grees of power in eccle&s;ia&s;tical, as there is in civil rule. This was tried for above &s;ixty years ago in the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts</HI> province; but it was prevented there; yet Mr. <HI>Sal|ton&s;tal</HI> who had quitted the pulpit in <HI>New-London,</HI> for the governors chair in <HI>Connecticut</HI> colony, brought in the &s;cheme there &s;oon after for a cla&s;icial power in each county, that men might appeal to, as they do from an inferior to a &s;uperior court! and after much contention it was, e&s;tab|li&s;hed by law; only with this re&s;erve. That as many as would, might di&s;&s;ent from it. My honoured grandfather, <HI>Jo&s;eph Bac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">us</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> with the other repre&s;entative from <HI>Norwich,</HI> &s;oon felt the effect of this new power; for as they had thought it duty to oppo&s;e it in the court, &s;o they did al&s;o in the church. But Mr. <HI>Woodward</HI> the mini&s;ter was re|&s;olute to bring in the &s;cheme there, and got a majority on his &s;ide; therefore rather than come under &s;uch a yoke, they, with a con&s;iderable part of the church withdrew, and held a &s;eparate meeting three months; and then the mini|&s;ter con&s;ented to have the matter tried by a council, tho' in the mean time he had laid them under <HI>church cen&s;ure</HI>; an account of which being conveyed to the general <HI>court,</HI> the repre&s;entatives were not &s;uffered to &s;it therein. Such were the early effects of this new power. However, af|ter many councils and much fatigue, <HI>a &s;um of money</HI> pre|vailed with that mini&s;ter to quit his place, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">And rarely can any &s;ociety now, get rid of a bad mini&s;ter, but <HI>by that means.</HI></NOTE> and the church in <HI>Norwich</HI> re&s;olved to continue upon their old platform.</P>
<P>The&s;e and &s;uch-like things prevented that new plan, called <HI>Saybrook regulation,</HI> from taking &s;o deep effect as many intended it &s;hould: yet they obtained one great arti|cle of power thereby, which they have generally held ever &s;ince, and that is the <HI>licencing of candidates for the mini|&s;try,</HI>

and &s;o <HI>limiting</HI> the churches to &s;uch in their choice of pa&s;tors. Yea this &s;piritual court has attempted to de|prive churches of their pa&s;tors who were already in office: one notable in&s;tance whereof, I will mention. In the be|ginning of our glorious revival of religion in the land, <HI>New-Haven</HI> con&s;ociation made &s;ome laws again&s;t mini&s;ters preaching in others pari&s;hes, if they were de&s;ired to the contrary: <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Laws of the &s;ame nature were &s;oon after carried into the gene|ral court and pa&s;&s;ed there.</NOTE> &s;oon after which, Mr. <HI>Philem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n Robbins</HI> of <HI>Branford,</HI> (who was a great friend to that work of God) received a letter from the pa&s;tor of a <HI>Bapti&s;t</HI> church in <HI>Wallingford,</HI> which informed him that tho' they were of different &s;entiments about the <HI>form</HI> of religion, yet as they agreed in the <HI>e&s;&s;entials,</HI> they de&s;ired him to come and preach among them. This he thought to be a rea&s;onable reque&s;t, and therefore appointed a meeting among them in the beginning of the year 1742. But before the appoint|ed time came, he received two letters, one from &s;ome of the inhabitants of that town, the other from &s;ome neighbouring mini&s;ters, which informed him that they did not think it would be for the be&s;t for him to preach among that people, and de&s;ired he would not; but gave no rea&s;on at all. Yet becau&s;e he would not put by a meeting which he had appointed merely at their reque&s;t, without any rea|&s;on given, he was fir&s;t excluded from the <HI>con&s;ociation,</HI> and then complaints were received there again&s;t him, from a few of his di&s;affected people; upon which he made an attempt to get reconciled again to the mini&s;ters, but found it could not be done upon any lower terms, than confe&s;&s;ing that he did wrong in preaching to that <HI>bapti&s;t</HI> &s;ociety as he did. <HI>That</HI> he could not in con&s;cience do; &s;o they part|ed, which opened a wider door for complaints than before, and &s;o many were carried in, that a con&s;ociation was ap|pointed in his own town to try the ca&s;e, and a citation was &s;ent to him to come and an&s;wer to many articles.</P>
<P>Hereupon Mr. <HI>Robbins</HI> called his church together, and laid the&s;e articles before them, with an&s;wers thereto; and the church manife&s;ted &s;atisfaction therewith: and as they found that the church was originally &s;ettled according to <HI>Cambridge platform,</HI> and had never voted an alteration; they now voted to abide by their old con&s;titution, and ap|pointed Mr. <HI>Robbins</HI> and others to go and inform the con|&s;ociation that they denied their juri&s;diction, and would not be tried by them. This was accordingly done; yet this

<HI>&s;piritual court</HI> declared that they had juri&s;diction of the ca&s;e, and went on to hear and try charges again&s;t him, without any to an&s;wer for him; and drew up and pub|li&s;hed their judgment that

and &s;o warned all to beware of him, 'till he made &s;atisfaction therefor. Mr. <HI>Robbins,</HI> having copies of the&s;e proceedings, publi&s;hed them to the world, in 1747. Afterward four of the in|habitants of <HI>Branford</HI> (if I remember right their number) went to the general court with a complaint that the town &s;till held this condemned man for their mini&s;ter, and prayed the court to turn him out of his place. This cau&s;ed a great turn in the rulers minds; and I know not who will now appear to ju&s;tify their conduct; and yet I fear there are but few who are convinced that the root of all this mi&s;chief lies in mans trying to modle church affairs accord|ing to worldly rule. In civil &s;tates particular men are in|ve&s;ted with authority to judge for the whole; but in Chri&s;t's kingdom each one has an equal right to judge for him&s;elf. Indeed there is a likene&s;s in this re&s;pect that all politic bodies have their limits and their power extends only to tho&s;e within their bounds; but then the limits of civil juri&s;diction is fixed by earthly power, and that of the church is only by voluntary con&s;ent; for Chri&s;t will have no pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d &s;oldiers in his army.</P>

<Q>You mu&s;t not judge.</Q>
But that was &s;o far from preventing, that it naturally produced a judgment in young converts, that tho&s;e who were offended at &s;uch free invitations, were &s;trangers to vital religion: and doubtle&s;s many exceeded due bounds in that way; yet to be more &s;everely dealt with therefor, than others were for the vile&s;t crimes, (as many were) this had no tendency to convince them that they were wrong, or their reprovers right.</P>

<P>They were expelled accordingly, and became teachers among the &s;eparates.

And as we have &s;ome other ordained pa&s;tors, who have con&s;iderable &s;kill in both the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> tongues; and three mem|bers of one &s;eparate church in <HI>Norwich,</HI> have each brought up a &s;on at college within the&s;e few years, one of which is now a tutor of <HI>Yale</HI> college; and as a like number have been &s;ent to college from <HI>Windham,</HI> be&s;ide &s;ome in other places; I leave Mr. <HI>Fi&s;h</HI> to con&s;ider how he can an&s;wer what he has &s;aid, either to God or man.</P>
<P>However, tho' his <HI>charge</HI> is far from truth, yet 'tis readi|ly granted, that we have a great di&s;like to &s;ome &s;orts of learn|ing, e&s;pecially the art of di&s;puting again&s;t the truth, as well as for it, the art of making ea&s;y things hard, in&s;tead of making hard things ea&s;y; &s;uch <HI>oppo&s;itions of &s;cience,</HI> we <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. 6.20</NOTE> have no likening to, nor of the art of handling the <HI>word of God deceitfully,</HI> and twi&s;ting things into any &s;hape to &s;uit men's own turns.

<P>When I read this, I confe&s;s it cau&s;ed this enquiry in my mind, If Mr. <HI>Fi&s;h</HI> knows no better, than to con&s;true this &s;cripture &s;o, where is his <HI>learning?</HI> and if he does, where is his <HI>hone&s;ty?</HI> His controver&s;y with us is about <HI>human</HI> learn|ing, whereas that text expre&s;&s;eth <HI>divine</HI> learning, as plain as words can po&s;&s;ibly do; and there is great rea&s;on to think, that the prophet here per&s;onates HIM, who tho' <HI>he were a &s;on, yet learned he obedience, by the things which he &s;uffered, and being tempted, he is able to &s;uccour them that are tempt|ed.</HI> Did any Phari&s;ee ever abu&s;e &s;cripture, to impo&s;e upon people, wor&s;e than this?</P>
<P>Let us con&s;ider another &s;cripture, namely, 2 Tim. 3.6. which our author gives us a large comment upon, in order to guard again&s;t tho&s;e that oppo&s;e their churches, and clo|&s;eth it by &s;aying,
<Q>This de&s;ign is hid from vulgar eyes, by the plau&s;ible covering or pretence, of &s;etting truth in a <HI>clearer light,</HI> and building up the church on a <HI>better footing,</HI> and of <HI>purer materials,</HI></Q>
p. 70. Now we may take notice, that the apo&s;tle makes no di&s;tinction in the text, between <HI>public</HI> and <HI>private</HI> hou&s;es, for he often taught both <HI>publickly</HI> and from <HI>hou&s;e to hou&s;e</HI>; but what he points out fal&s;e teachers by, is, the manner of their getting in, and the work they do when they are in. As to the fir&s;t, they <HI>creep into hou&s;es</HI>: and we all know that <HI>creeping</HI> is oppo|&s;ite to going <HI>upright,</HI> therefore when Peter <HI>di&s;&s;embled,</HI> Paul with&s;tood <HI>him to the face,</HI> becau&s;e he <HI>walked not uprightly, according to the truth of the go&s;pel</HI>; and that concerning introducing the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> &s;chemes into the <HI>chri&s;tian</HI> church, Gal. 2.11 &mdash; 14. I leave Mr. <HI>F.</HI> to con&s;ider how well this will agree with his notion, that the
<Q>chri&s;tian church is made up of the <HI>&s;ame materials,</HI> that the Jewi&s;h church was.</Q></P>
<P>I remember that Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> in his <HI>farewell &s;ermon</HI> at <HI>Northampton,</HI> warned that people of their danger of being impo&s;ed upon, for he &s;aid, he knew the <HI>art</HI> that &s;ome young mini&s;ters had got, of <HI>di&s;gui&s;ing</HI> their principles, 'till they could get into place, and then they would corrupt people's minds by degrees. This leads to the other branch of the text under con&s;ideration, which is, that when tho&s;e teachers are got into hou&s;es, they <HI>lead captive &s;illy women laden with &s;in, led away with divers lu&s;ts.</HI> And how many have there been in our day, who have appeared in a <HI>Cal|vini&s;t</HI> garb till they have got &s;ettled, and then as fa&s;t as

any <HI>women</HI> or others came <HI>laden with &s;in,</HI> to talk with them about their &s;ouls concern, they would <HI>lead</HI> them to the <HI>church,</HI> in&s;tead of leading them to <HI>Chri&s;t fir&s;t,</HI> and &s;o they are &s;ettled down in a <HI>form of Godline&s;s</HI>; and <HI>this &s;ort</HI> of men, will &s;oon <HI>deny the power</HI> of it. ver&s;e. 5.

And if we had no &s;uch men in our land, can it be thought, that we &s;hould have heard <HI>Judas</HI> cried up &s;o much as we have? I mean not to reflect upon any man's per&s;on, but only to hold up the plain truth, and leave all men to judge for them&s;elves; and where any &s;uch men are found, God's command in ver. 5. is, <HI>From &s;uch turn away.</HI> Mr. <HI>F.</HI> pretends, that tho&s;e teachers were for building the church, "of purer materials" than others; whereas the text &s;peaks expre&s;sly of <HI>that &s;ort</HI> of men, who have the form, but deny the <HI>power of godline&s;s.</HI></P>

<P>And on Oct. 9. 1745. A new &s;eparate church in <HI>Mans|field</HI> was gathered, and they made choice of Mr. <HI>Thomas Mar&s;h</HI> for their pa&s;tor, who had for many years been a deacon in the &s;econd church in <HI>Windham</HI>; and they ap|pointed his ordination to be on <HI>Jan.</HI> 6. 1746. But the day before, many of the &s;tanding mini&s;ters met in that town, and at the &s;ame time Mr. <HI>Mar&s;h</HI> was &s;eized by an officer, and carried to <HI>Windham</HI> Goal, for preaching &s;ome|time before, without licence from the mini&s;ters; and on the day propo&s;ed for his ordination, as a great a&s;&s;embly were engag'd in religious wor&s;hip, there came up a dozen or fourteen mini&s;ters, and de&s;ired a conference with this new church; hoping likely that now the <HI>&s;hepherd</HI> was ta|ken, they might <HI>&s;catter the &s;heep.</HI> What they talked of, was to try to convince them of their errors; but when they had begun with that old argument, "Take him Goaler!" that powerful argument upon the <HI>body</HI>; what free acce&s;s could they rationally expect after that, to convince the mind? They complained afterward, of meeting with <HI>noi&s;y treatment,</HI> and who could expect le&s;s?</P>

<P>_WHEN we fir&s;t appeared again&s;t, having the wor|thy, and the unworthy partake together at the Lord's &s;upper, (which was a principal rea&s;on of our fathers &s;eparation from the Church of <HI>England</HI>) mini&s;ters told us, as I have before proved, that <HI>tares</HI> and <HI>wheat</HI> mu&s;t grow together in the church, 'till the harve&s;t: for they knew there were many both in pub|lic and private &s;tations, who, notwith&s;tanding their <HI>form</HI> of godline&s;s, <HI>appeared</HI> as plainly again&s;t the <HI>power</HI> of it, as the <HI>tares</HI> appeared by their <HI>fruits</HI> in the field.

becau&s;e we would not confound church and world toge|ther, as they did, they &s;hifted about, and accu&s;ed us with a&s;&s;uming God's prerogative to &s;earch the heart; while they a&s;&s;erted, that we could not know who were &s;aints, and who not. And when 'twas reply'd, that Chri&s;t &s;aid, <HI>ye &s;hall know them</HI>: the return would often be, What, are you <HI>infallible</HI>? Whereupon di&s;putes have en&s;ued, which have often been carried to extremes on both hands.

<P>And doubtle&s;s confidence has been carried beyond evi|dence, in many in&s;tances; and I &s;uppo&s;e many have been more concerned to keep up a good opinion of &s;uch as they have received for chri&s;tians, than they have to di&s;charge their duty towards them in a go&s;pel manner.

<P>Mr. <HI>F.</HI> knows that our chief di&s;putes, have been upon <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|&s;ibilities</HI> and not &s;ecrets. The fir&s;t thing which he advances, to prove that &s;eparates had a bad &s;pirit, is that,
<Q>They en|deavoured to draw off from us, every true believer, or chri&s;tian, (in their &s;en&s;e of the word) and would have left a congregation behind them, of nothing but &s;uch as they judged to be hypocrites and gracele&s;s per&s;ons: without the benefit of one &s;aint to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, in the affairs of their &s;ouls.</Q></P>
<P>And he directly turns to the parable of the <HI>tares,</HI> as a <HI>&s;ure</HI> proof that this was wrong; and adds, as a great agra|vation of their crime, that they would call others to,
<Q><HI>Come out from among them, and be &s;eparate</HI>; with this re|flection,</Q>
<Q>If they are chri&s;tians, why don't they come away from the Shades of <HI>Babylon</HI>!</Q>

<HI>Solomon</HI> tells us that <HI>words fitly &s;poken,</HI> are like <HI>apples of gold, in pictures of &s;ilver</HI>&punc; and I think the&s;e words of Mr. <HI>Mitchel</HI> are &s;uch; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Mr. <HI>Fi&s;h</HI> often refers us to this godly man; I would de|&s;ire him to turn and look into this gla&s;s him&s;elf.

like the &s;tanding church now, and not like the &s;eparates, from an account of that church, which is given in the appen|dix to Mr. <HI>Robbins</HI>'s ordination &s;ermon; and after picking out a few pa&s;&s;ages, which are chiefly the opinion of the writer of the account, now in the year 1760, he then re|fers it to the reader to judge how little <HI>re&s;emblance</HI> there is between them and us, p. 84.

<Q>&s;uffice, for a man publickly to &s;ay, <HI>I believe on Chri&s;t, or do unfeignedly repent of my &s;ins?</HI> Or to con&s;ent to &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions being read, or propounded unto him, without any more adoe?</Q>

<P>There has been a great deal of &s;mother rai&s;ed in our day to hide or get over the&s;e &s;elf evident truths, many have been for lowering the profe&s;&s;ion &s;o that it might not imply &s;aving faith in it; but Zion's king &s;ays <HI>He that is not for me is again&s;t me</HI>; and he declares that <HI>publicans</HI> and <HI>har|lots go into the kingdom of God before</HI> tho&s;e who &s;aid, <HI>I go &s;ir; and went not.

to perplex &s;incere minds; this argument has ju&s;tly been retorted back again: for none will pretend to admit per|&s;ons without &s;ome &s;ort of qualification or other: and 'tis va&s;tly more difficult to determine the point concerning <HI>mo|ral</HI> &s;incerity, than <HI>gracious</HI> &s;incerity; for the fir&s;t is only re&s;traints and influences <HI>upon</HI> a per&s;on, while the other is a living principle <HI>within</HI> him; and I think this is an unan&s;wer|able rea&s;on which Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> gives, why the latter, and not the other, makes meet members for Chri&s;t's Church, namely that moral &s;incerity is <HI>tran&s;ient,</HI> and may be intire|ly lo&s;t; but a gracious principle <HI>abides</HI> for ever.

And as a principal means of begetting and increa&s;ing this love, is <HI>declaring</HI> to each other what <HI>God has done</HI> for our <HI>&s;ouls</HI>; &s;o our Lord &s;ays, <HI>Every tree is known by his own fruit,&mdash;a good man out of the good trea&s;ure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good:</HI> And the beloved di&s;ciple &s;ays, <HI>That which we have &s;een and heard, declare we unto you, that ye al&s;o may have fellow&s;hip with us,</HI> &amp;c. And to &s;hew that our &s;entiments are not &s;ingular, as well as for the edification of the &s;aints, I will here tran&s;cribe a little of what was wrote in the la&s;t century, by one who is allow'd to be a man of as great learning and piety as any in his day.</P>
<P>I mean Dr. <HI>John Owen,</HI> who, after ob&s;erving how men are liable to mi&s;takes in various ways, and giving cautions accordingly, he proceeds to &s;peak of &s;ome duties which can't be performed without &s;ome knowledge of others &s;tate, and al&s;o of the way wherein it is attained," 1&s;t. There are, &s;ays he,
<Q>many duties incumbent on us to be performed, with and towards profe&s;&s;ors, which without admitting a judgment to be made of their &s;tate and con|dition, cannot be performed in faith. And in reference unto the&s;e duties alone, it is that we are called to judge the &s;tate of others. For we are not giving countenance unto a ra&s;h uncharitable cen&s;uring of mens &s;piritual conditions, nor unto any judging of any men, any other than what our own duty towards them doth in|di&s;pen&s;ably require. Thus if we are to lay down our lives for the brethren, it is very meet that we &s;hould &s;o far know them &s;o to be, as that we may hazard our lives in faith when we are called thereunto. We are al&s;o to join with them in tho&s;e ordinances wherein we make a &s;olemn profe&s;&s;ion, that we are members of the &s;ame body with them, that we have the &s;ame head, the &s;ame faith and love: we mu&s;t love them becau&s;e they are begotten of God, children of our heavenly fa|ther; and therefore mu&s;t on &s;ome good ground believe them &s;o to be. In a word, the due performance of all principal mutual go&s;pel duties, to the glory of God, and our own edification, depend upon this &s;uppo&s;ition, that we may have &s;uch &s;atisfying per&s;ua&s;ion concerning the
<PB N="59" REF="010823_0030_0F81D4866A417970">
&s;piritual condition of others, as that from which we may take our aim in what we do.</Q></P>
<P N="2"><Q>2. For the grounds hereof, I &s;hall mention one only, which all others do lean upon. This is pre&s;&s;ed, 1 Cor. 12.12, 13. As the body is one, and hath many mem|bers, and all the members of that one body being many, are one body, &s;o is Chri&s;t: for by one &s;pirit we are all bapti|zed into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free, and have been made all to drink into one &s;pirit. They are all united unto, and hold of one head; &s;o is Chri&s;t my&s;tical, that is, all believers under Chri&s;t their head. And this union they have by the inhabi|tation of the &s;ame quickning Spirit, which is in Chri&s;t their head, and by him they are all brought into the &s;ame &s;piritual &s;tate and frame; they are made to drink into one and the &s;ame &s;pirit; for this &s;ame &s;pirit pro|duceth the &s;ame effects in them all, the &s;ame in kind tho' differing in degrees, as the apo&s;tle fully declares. Eph. 4.3&mdash;6. And this &s;pirit is in them and not in the world, Joh. 16. And as it gives them a naturalne&s;s in their duties one towards another, or in mutual caring for, rejoicing and &s;orrowing with one another as mem|bers one of another. 1 Cor. 12.25, 26. So that it reveals and di&s;covers them to each other, &s;o far as is necce&s;&s;ary for the performance of the duties mentioned, in &s;uch a manner as becomes members of the &s;ame body. There is on this account a &s;piritually natural an&s;wering of one to another, as face an&s;wereth face in the water, they can &s;ee and di&s;cern that in others whereof they have expe|rience in them&s;elves, they ta&s;te and reli&s;h that in others which they feed upon in them&s;elves, and wherein the lives of their &s;ouls do con&s;i&s;t; the &s;ame &s;pirit of life be|ing in them, they have the &s;ame &s;piritual ta&s;te and fa|vor. And unle&s;s their palates are di&s;tempered by temp|tation or fal&s;e opinion or prejudices, they can in their communion ta&s;te of that &s;pirit in each other, which they are all made to drink into. This gives them the &s;ame likene&s;s and image in the inward man, the &s;ame heavenly light in their minds, the &s;ame affections; and being thus prepared to judge and di&s;cern of the &s;tates of each other, in reference unto their mutual duties, they have moreover the true rule of the word to judge of all &s;pirits and &s;piritual effects by. And this is the ground of all that love without di&s;&s;imulation, and real communion
<PB N="60" REF="010823_0031_0F81D4872A4793F0">
that is among the &s;aints of God in this world. If the&s;e are omitted, there is an end of all profitable u&s;e of church-&s;ociety. Churches without this, are but mere hu&s;ks and &s;hells of churches, carca&s;es without &s;ouls; for as there is no real union unto Chri&s;t without faith, &s;o there is no real union among the members of any church without love, and that acting it&s;elf in all the duties mentioned, let not this ordinance be in vain.</Q>

And now, where is the power that is derived by a <HI>local &s;ucce&s;&s;ion</HI> from the apo&s;tles?

It is well
<PB N="63" REF="010823_0032_0F81D487F3613E78">
known that the word <HI>elder</HI> in &s;cripture, does not always mean per&s;ons in office, either in church or &s;tate; but often is u&s;ed only for per&s;ons of &s;uperior gifts, age or experience; yea the name, when applied to officers, &s;eems to derive its original, from the cu&s;tom of chu&s;ing &s;uch per&s;ons into office; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Elders among the <HI>Jews,</HI> were the mo&s;t con&s;iderable per&s;ons for age, experience, and wi&s;dom, who con&s;tituted the council of the people; among the <HI>primative chri&s;tians,</HI> tho&s;e of the fir&s;t rank in the church were called <HI>elders</HI></Q>

<P>Upon the whole, I can freely leave it with every con|&s;cience to judge, whether the &s;criptures carry the point a whit further than this, <HI>That leading men in the primitive church, led in ordinations as well as other things.</HI> And who will di&s;pute that point with any body? Tho&s;e who hold the power to
<Q>con&s;titute in office, and to remove from office,</Q>
to be intirely in the church, yet always ap|point leading men, (and &s;uch as are in office when they can be conveniently had) to act in and for the church, in ordinations. Much &s;tre&s;s is laid by many, on the terms, <HI>commit thou,</HI> in 2 Tim. 2.2. in order to prove the power of ordination to be inherent in them, who are already in office; but it has been already proved, that the apo&s;tles them&s;elves, (even tho' they &s;ometimes conveyed extraordi|nary gifts by laying on their hands, yet) did not pretend to act in ordinations, only in con&s;equence of the churches act; therefore they properly acted as the churches mouth, in putting men into office, and <HI>charging</HI> them to be faith|ful therein: and <HI>Timothy,</HI> and all other leaders, ought to be very careful when they are called to a&s;&s;i&s;t in ordinati|ons, to &s;ee that they commit the charge of &s;ouls, only to <HI>faithful men. Paul</HI> in writing to this &s;ame per&s;on, u&s;eth the &s;ame words, This <HI>charge</HI> I <HI>commit</HI> unto thee; and, I <HI>give</HI> thee <HI>charge,</HI> as &s;ynonymous terms, 1 Tim. 1.18. &amp; 6.13. And be the right of ordination where it will, yet this is certain, that the direction is to commit the charge of &s;ouls to <HI>faithful men</HI>; and none but &s;uch can truly be in the go&s;pel line; and when any <HI>creep in,</HI> under a <HI>&s;heeps cloath|ing,</HI> who are not truly &s;uch; when they di&s;cover by their fruits that they are <HI>fal&s;e</HI> men, our Lord commands his peo|ple to <HI>beware of them,</HI> Mat. 7.14, 15.</P>
<P>Another text which is often advanced to prove that mi|ni&s;terial power is handed down by an external line from
<PB N="64" REF="010823_0033_0F81D488B1B75738">
the apo&s;tles, is Mat. 28.18,&mdash;20. But I think two things may be &s;ufficient to evince the ab&s;urdity of con&s;truing that commi&s;&s;ion and promi&s;e in &s;uch a way.</P>
<P N="1">1. All the promi&s;es of God, are IN Chri&s;t Je&s;us; and the heirs of promi&s;e are only &s;uch as have <HI>fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope &s;et before us,</HI> 2 Cor. 1.20. Heb. 6.17, 18. How vain then mu&s;t the attempt be, to apply that promi&s;e to any who have not <HI>fled</HI> to the go&s;pel <HI>refuge</HI>?</P>
<P N="2">2. Our Lord connects <HI>precept</HI> and <HI>promi&s;e</HI> together in the text, <HI>Teaching them to ob&s;erve all things, what&s;oever I have commanded you: and lo I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world</HI>: Therefore this promi&s;e is &s;o far from &s;upporting a <HI>&s;ucce&s;&s;ion</HI> of unconverted mini&s;ters, that it could not &s;upport even the apo&s;tles them&s;elves, if they turn|ed a&s;ide from the line of truth; yea, in&s;tead of the <HI>promi&s;e,</HI> the <HI>cur&s;e</HI> would &s;eize upon an apo&s;tle or angel, if they &s;hould turn off from the go&s;pel way, as I have proved be|fore. Should any &s;ay, that tho&s;e words of <HI>Paul</HI> are <HI>hypo|thetical</HI> expre&s;&s;ions; i. e. &s;uppo&s;ing a ca&s;e for illu&s;tration, which is not granted, for 'tis readily allowed, that they are &s;o; but I would have people remember, that 'tis chiefly from &s;uch ways of &s;peaking, that they draw their pleas for unconverted mini&s;ters, as from 1 Cor. 13.1&mdash;3. &amp;c.</P>
<P>To &s;hew that my opinion about a line of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is not &s;ingular, I will tran&s;cribe &s;ome of Dr. <HI>Owen</HI>'s thoughts thereon, which were publi&s;hed in <HI>London</HI> 1692. in a &s;mall piece called, "A guide to church-fellow&s;hip and order," wherein he &s;ays, p. 47, 48.
<Q>The office of the mini&s;try, for the <HI>continuation</HI> of the <HI>church &s;tate,</HI> and admini&s;tra|tion of all ordinances of wor&s;hip unto the end of the world, is &s;ufficiently &s;ecured, (1.) By the <HI>law,</HI> con&s;ti|tution and appointment of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, erect|ing that office, and giving warranty for its continuance, to the con&s;ummation of all things, Mat. 28.20. Eph. 4.13. (2.) By his continuance according unto his promi&s;e, to communicate <HI>&s;piritual gifts</HI> unto men, for the mini&s;terial edification of the church.&mdash;(3.) On the duty of believers, or of the <HI>church,</HI> which is, to chu&s;e, call, and &s;olemnly &s;et apart unto the office of the mini|&s;try, &s;uch as the Lord Chri&s;t by his &s;pirit, hath made meet for it, according unto the rule of his word.</Q></P>
<P><Q>If all the&s;e, or any of them do fail, I acknowledge, &s;ays he, that all <HI>mini&s;terial authority</HI> and ability for the di&s;pen&s;ation of go&s;pel ordinances mu&s;t fail al&s;o, and con&s;equently the &s;tate of the <HI>church.</HI> And tho&s;e who
<PB N="65" REF="010823_0033_0F81D488B1B75738">
plead for the continuation of a <HI>&s;ucce&s;&s;ive mini&s;try,</HI> with|out re&s;pect unto the&s;e things, without re&s;olving both the <HI>authority</HI> and <HI>office</HI> of it unto them, do but erect a <HI>dead image,</HI> in&s;tead of the living and life giving in&s;titutions of Chri&s;t. They take away the <HI>living creature,</HI> and &s;et up a <HI>&s;kin &s;tuffed with &s;traw.</HI></Q>
Thus far Dr. <HI>Owen.</HI></P>
<P>Compare this with the opinions of the pre&s;ent day. Mr. <HI>Fi&s;h</HI> &s;ays,
<Q>Tis true indeed, Je&s;us did not go into the <HI>colleges</HI> or &s;chools of learning, for his fir&s;t mini&s;ters: nor was there any need of &s;uch a &s;tep, while Chri&s;t him|&s;elf was per&s;onally pre&s;ent, to educate his &s;ons. But they, whom he took into his &s;chool, were chiefly unlearn|ed and ignorant men: to whom, in a little time, he gave &s;uch a mea&s;ure of knowledge, learning and grace, as abundantly qualified them for the great work, where|to he appointed them.</Q>
p. 15. But now he &s;ays,
<Q>The <HI>&s;eparates</HI> having &s;hut learning out of doors, have there|by deprived them&s;elves of the <HI>be&s;t means</HI> of obtaining and pre&s;erving the <HI>knowledge</HI> of <HI>pure divine truths.</HI></Q>
p. 169.
<Q>Neither do they <HI>know</HI> whether the bible is rightly tran&s;lated, ONLY as they have it from the <HI>learned.</HI></Q>
p. 167. And he &s;ays, our holding the whole <HI>power</HI> of <HI>ordi|nation</HI> to be in the <HI>church,</HI> is
<Q>without <HI>any</HI> direction in the whole word of God; and contrary to plain go&s;pel example. p. 145.</Q>
But Men &s;ays he,
<Q>Having the word of reconciliation <HI>committed</HI> to them, by auth|orized hands, they become amba&s;&s;adors for Chri&s;t, p. 17.</Q></P>
<P>Here reader ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="1">1. That I have proved that he charges us fal&s;ely, as to our &s;hutting out learning.</P>
<P N="2">2. Here is an awful &s;troke again&s;t the divinity of Je&s;us Chri&s;t: for it has been proved a little back, that the <HI>end</HI> of the <HI>conver&s;ation</HI> of true leaders is, Je&s;us Chri&s;t <HI>the</HI> SAME <HI>ye&s;terday, and to day&punc; and for ever.</HI> But the end of Mr. <HI>Fi&s;h</HI>'s <HI>conver&s;ation</HI> is the contrary, and &s;o is that of a great part of the mini&s;ters of our land: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>About 13 years ago, Dr. <HI>Mayhew</HI> of <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> plainly in print &s;truck again&s;t the <HI>eternal</HI> and <HI>e&s;&s;entia</HI>&punc; divinity of our Lord Je&s;us. Which occa&s;ioned Mr. <HI>Pemberton</HI>'s publi&s;hing a &s;ermon with an appendix, upon Chri&s;t's <HI>power</HI> and <HI>divinity</HI>; to which Dr. <HI>Sewall,</HI> Mr. <HI>Prince,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Foxcroft,</HI> wrote a preface, wherein they expre&s;s their hopes that,
<Q>By the ble&s;&s;ing of Chri&s;t, it may be of excellent &s;ervice to guard many of the readers, from tho&s;e mo&s;t dangerous &s;ugge&s;tions again&s;t his adorable deity, which have been of late unhappily publi&s;hed, to the great grief and offence of many among us.</Q></P>
<P>They don't name either the author of book; yet this was the plaine&s;t te&s;timony that was publi&s;hed among us on that occa&s;ion, as ever I heard of: neither can I learn that Dr. <HI>Mayhew</HI> ever retracted that dangerous and fundamental error; yet after he died in July 1766, he was celebrated from the pulpit, and pre&s;s, by many mini&s;ters in town and country, as one of the brighte&s;t characters among them. Dr. <HI>Chauncy,</HI> who formerly wrote &s;o much to try to prove that <HI>New-England</HI> mini&s;ters had not forfeit|ed their character, by any of their open conduct, publi&s;hed a fu|neral &s;ermon for him, wherein he greatly extols Dr. <HI>Mayhew</HI>; and in a note, p. 28. he &s;ays,
<Q>Two or 3 years ago a pam|phlet appeared among us under the name of an <HI>ob&s;cure</HI> per&s;on, without <HI>reputation</HI>;&mdash;in which the Dr. was repre&s;ented as an <HI>enemy to the atonement made by Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> The writer of that piece (&s;ays Dr. <HI>C.</HI>) knew little of the Dr. or the true meaning of his works. He might as well have taxed <HI>any</HI> mini|&s;ter in the <HI>town</HI> or <HI>province</HI> upon this head.</Q>
If I believed Dr. <HI>Chauncy</HI>'s te&s;timony in this, I &s;hould have a wor&s;e opinion of that order of mini&s;ters than I ever yet had; for I have great rea&s;on to believe, that Dr. <HI>Mayhew</HI>'s writings, have done the mo&s;t to corrupt peoples minds, and to prejudice them again&s;t the pure <HI>doctrines of grace,</HI> as they were held by the <HI>fathers</HI> of this country, of any one man in our land.</P>
<P>The <HI>ob&s;cure</HI> per&s;on without <HI>reputation,</HI> which Dr. <HI>C.</HI> refers to, is Mr. <HI>John Cleaveland,</HI> who was expell'd out of <HI>college,</HI> after he had been there about 3 years, only for his attending the wor&s;hip of God, with the church which he was a member of, in&s;tead of going to hear a <HI>candidate</HI> which the <HI>a&s;&s;ociation</HI> and the world had &s;et up, in oppo&s;ition to the <HI>church.</HI> He wrote again&s;t two of Dr. <HI>M.</HI> &s;ermons; and the pre&s;ident who expelled him, did him&s;elf &s;o much honor on this occa&s;ion, as to &s;end Mr. <HI>Cleave|land</HI> a degree of <HI>ma&s;ter</HI> of <HI>arts.</HI></P></NOTE> For what le&s;s can be
<PB N="66" REF="010823_0034_0F81D4897255B630">
the import of &s;aying, that Chri&s;t taught and qualified men for the mini&s;try, when he was "per&s;onally pre&s;ent," as he cannot or does not do now; what le&s;s can it be than to &s;ay, he is not <HI>truly God</HI> by nature, but only &s;o by <HI>office,</HI> and that having &s;et up officers in his kingdom, he has gone to heaven, and left them to order affairs in his ab&s;ence? God has often changed his di&s;pen&s;ations, but his nature and his grace remain ever the &s;ame. He in&s;pired men to write the &s;criptures, and gave them power to <HI>confirm his word</HI> with <HI>diver&s;e miracles</HI>; which is not nece&s;&s;ary, &s;ince the bible is acknowledged to be complete. But 'tis as great a truth now, as ever, that, <HI>No man knoweth the things of God, but the &s;pirit of God</HI>; and that each faint has <HI>receiv|ed</HI> this &s;pirit, that they <HI>might</HI> KNOW <HI>the things that are freely given to them of God.</HI> Yet Mr. <HI>F.</HI> declares that we

don't
<Q>know whether we have the <HI>pure divine truths</HI> or not, ONLY as we have it from the <HI>learned.</HI></Q>
Whereas <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays, <HI>my &s;peech, and my preaching was not with entice|ing words of man's wi&s;dom, but in</HI> DEMONSTRATION <HI>of the</HI> SPIRIT, <HI>and of power: that your</HI> FAITH <HI>&s;hould not &s;tand in the wi&s;dom of men, but in the power of God,</HI> 1 Cor. 2.4, 5.11, 12. And <HI>John</HI> &s;ays, <HI>little children, ye have an uncti|on from the holy</HI> ONE, and <HI>ye</HI> KNOW <HI>all things</HI>; and <HI>the anointing which ye have received of him, abideth in you: and ye need not that any man teach you; but as the &s;ame anoint|ing, teacheth you of all things.</HI> And he expre&s;sly declares, that <HI>it is the &s;pirit of antichri&s;t</HI> which <HI>denies this.</HI> 1 John 2.18 &mdash; 27.</P>
<P>Then let Mr. <HI>F.</HI> look to it; for he has told us from Dr. <HI>Owen</HI> that the
<Q><HI>be&s;t</HI> of human nature, if not united to the divine nature, is no better than <HI>&s;and</HI> to build the church upon.</Q>
p 56. Yea, and he has al&s;o given it as a clear mark of Chri&s;t's church, that it always has his <HI>holy &s;pirit dwelling in it.</HI> What non&s;en&s;e (if no wor&s;e) then is it, to tell of Chri&s;t's &s;ervants deriving their <HI>knowledge</HI> of the truth and <HI>right</HI> to preach it, only from the hands of men? His argument is that,
<Q>There is nothing of <HI>in&s;piration</HI> in <HI>tran&s;lating</HI> the bible.</Q>
An&s;wer, there is as much of in|&s;piration in that, as there is in <HI>tran&s;cribing</HI> of it; and how many thou&s;and times has that been done, before it came to the copy that he has &s;een? and how does he know he has got the <HI>pure truth,</HI> as it was wrote by in&s;piration? True prote&s;tants all confe&s;s, that the <HI>certain</HI> knowledge of the truth, is attained only by the &s;ame way in the nature of it, which <HI>Paul</HI> points out for the <HI>unlearned,</HI> to gain it by; even that when truth is rightly delivered in <HI>words ea&s;y to be under&s;tood, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all; and thus are the &s;ecrets of his heart made manife&s;t; and falling down on his face, he will wor&s;hip God, and report that God is in you of a truth.</HI> This is in the mid&s;t of the chapter, which is concluded with a precept which the&s;e mini&s;ters often remind us of, viz. <HI>Let all things be done decent|ly and in order,</HI> 1 Cor. 14.9, 24, 25, 40. And a main <HI>indecency</HI> and <HI>di&s;order</HI> which is therein condemned, is &s;peak|ing in the church, in language not ea&s;ily under&s;tood. And who are more guilty of &s;uch <HI>di&s;orders</HI> than the&s;e great pre|tenders to <HI>learning</HI>!

<Q>Suffer me here, to drop a word of awakening, to all <HI>you</HI> that have &s;eparated from our churches, that if <HI>this confe&s;&s;ion</HI> of Mr. <HI>Davenport,</HI> toge|ther with the truths that <HI>have</HI> been, and <HI>are yet</HI> to be told you, don't convince you that you have been, and &s;till are <HI>deluded,</HI> that is, <HI>deceived</HI> and turned a&s;ide from the way of truth and duty, <HI>in the matter of your &s;epara|ting,</HI> you may, from your <HI>non conviction,</HI> KNOW FOR CERTAIN, not only that you <HI>are</HI> thus <HI>deluded,</HI> but that your <HI>delu&s;ion</HI> is very &s;trong.</Q>

<P>It de&s;erves particular notice, that this <HI>new infallible</HI> tri|bunal, delivers off the &s;entence, as the <HI>old</HI> one u&s;ed to do, from a <HI>fallible</HI> rule; which rule the judge does not &s;eem to under&s;tand very well him&s;elf; for Mr. <HI>Dapenport's</HI> great|e&s;t error was, his a&s;&s;uming the power to him&s;elf to <HI>try</HI> mi|ni&s;ters, and then his openly "advi&s;ing and urging" people to for&s;ake &s;uch as he had condem'd, by a

ob&s;erved in <HI>exhorters,</HI> was their being "puft up." This is the rule that our new judge gives &s;entence upon: and in p. 164. he &s;ays,
<Q><HI>Stand by thy &s;elf, come not near me, for I am bolier than thou,</HI> (P&s;al. 65.5.) is certain|ly the language of &s;piritual pride; but this was the lan|guage of &s;eparating from our churches, becau&s;e (as they &s;aid) there were hypocrites in them, which they could commune with.</Q>
But I think we may claim liberty of a <HI>review</HI> upon this judgment: for the text &s;ays nothing con|cerning &s;eparating <HI>good</HI> men from <HI>bad</HI> ones: others are allowed to be <HI>holy,</HI> but the proud language is, I am <HI>holier</HI> than thou.

yet &s;ome of his concluding advice to his people is,
<Q>Go not after them nor follow them.&mdash;How can you, with a good con&s;cience, after <HI>I have &s;hewn you</HI> from <HI>whence</HI> they aro&s;e, their <HI>principles, &s;pirit</HI> and <HI>tendency</HI>? They are <HI>&s;eparates</HI>; let them be &s;o, let them alone.</Q>

<Q><HI>Writing</HI> down all that is judged expedient to deliver, at that time, and <HI>pray|ing</HI> for a&s;&s;i&s;tance in delivering, is no way in|con&s;i&s;tent, but incumbent duty.</Q>

When <HI>writing</HI> for the pre&s;s, and <HI>writing</HI> for the <HI>pulpit,</HI> can be proved to be equal, then this text may &s;erve the turn 'tis brought for, and not 'till then.

<PB N="75" REF="010823_0038_0F81D48DCFAFE650">
"They which preach the <HI>go&s;pel</HI> &s;hall live of the law:" yea, and not the <HI>law</HI> of God, but by the <HI>law</HI> of <HI>man</HI>; and however pious the per&s;ons might be who fir&s;t made the law; I think the evidences that have been before exhi|bited, prove that the law in it &s;elf is of &s;uch a nature, as that which we read of in P&s;al. 94.20. For tho' &s;ome may think that tho&s;e <HI>&s;poiling of goods,</HI> and <HI>haling men and wo|men to pri&s;on,</HI> which we have &s;een, is only an <HI>abu&s;e</HI> of the law; yet a little reflection may convince them of their mi&s;|take, and that the <HI>u&s;e</HI> of it carries tho&s;e things in its very nature. The great de&s;ign of the law, is to make all the inhabitants of the town or pari&s;h, pay what the rulers &s;ay is their part towards the incumbent mini&s;ters &s;upport; and the natural language of all that are attached to that way is,
<Q>If others are not <HI>made</HI> to do their part, I will not do mine,</Q>
and where all the people <HI>love to have it &s;o,</HI> they may get along without &s;uch open <HI>violence</HI>: but when any happen to be convinced that the way is wrong, and &s;o will not give what is required, they are naturally led to <HI>take it by force.</HI> God &s;aid of the prie&s;ts, who practi&s;ed &s;o formerly, that their <HI>&s;in was very great,</HI> 1 Sam. 2.16.17. And how vain is it, for men to &s;ay otherwi&s;e of &s;uch practice now?</P>
<P>Many plead in this ca&s;e, that promi&s;e to the church, that <HI>Kings &s;hall be her nur&s;ing fathers, and Queens her nur&s;ing mothers.</HI> But what an odd &s;tory would it be, for any to tell of very <HI>kind parents,</HI> who manife&s;ted &s;uch a <HI>tender</HI> re|gard for their children, that they would <HI>rob</HI> one child of his food, or <HI>ca&s;t</HI> him <HI>into a dungeon,</HI> to uphold another in grandeur! Power mu&s;t be exerted in families or king|doms to <HI>re&s;train</HI> one per&s;on or community from <HI>injuring</HI> another; but nothing can bring any to act aright in the performance or &s;upport of divine wor&s;hp, but light and truth. Hence when the place and furniture for wor&s;hip, was to be provided in the wilderne&s;s with co&s;tly materials; tho' the great lawgiver, could infallibly have pre&s;cribed each mans part by law, if he had been plea&s;ed &s;o to do; yet he took another method. For <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> &s;pake unto all the congregation of the children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> &s;aying, <HI>This is the thing which the Lord commanded, &s;aying, Take ye from among you an offering unto the Lord: who&s;oever is of a willing heart, let him bring it, an offering of the Lord; gold, &s;ilver,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Exod.</HI> 35.4, 5. So when the <HI>temple</HI> was to be built, <HI>David</HI> appeared as a <HI>nur&s;ing father</HI> in <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and &s;et his <HI>affection</HI> to the hou&s;e of his God, in &s;uch a manner,
<PB N="76" REF="010823_0039_0F81D48E9E4A7888">
that of <HI>his own proper goods,</HI> he gave thereto, <HI>three thou|&s;and talents of gold,</HI> and <HI>&s;even thou&s;and talents of refined &s;ilver</HI>: and by his in&s;truction and example, he moved other fathers and rulers to <HI>offer willingly</HI> for the hou&s;e, above 5000 <HI>talents of gold,</HI> and a 10,000 <HI>talents of &s;ilver,</HI> be&s;ide great preparations of other materials. 1 Chron. 29.3&mdash;7.

And tho' I know but little, yet in all that has been &s;aid upon the&s;e controver&s;ies, I never could &s;ee any proof from the bible of any allowance of the u&s;e of <HI>coercive</HI> power, to <HI>compel</HI> any to bring their offering, even under the law, where church and &s;tate were one: how much le&s;s then can it be warrantable under the go&s;pel, where Chri&s;t's <HI>kingdom is not of this world</HI>?

<PB N="92" REF="010823_0047_0F81D49869AE1AE0">
Mr. <HI>Matthew Smith</HI> of <HI>Mansfield,</HI> had preached upon trial, to that church, a con&s;iderable time, 'till they thought proper to appoint a meeting to &s;eek for divine direction, and to proceed to the choice of a pa&s;tor, as they might have clearne&s;s; and there happened to be &s;everal other teachers pre&s;ent, one of which, when the que&s;tion was a&s;ked about, what &s;hould be the <HI>method</HI> of proceeding, in choo&s;ing a pa&s;tor? An&s;wered, that if any &s;ee it to be their lot, they &s;hould declare it.

And the re&s;t of the day was &s;pent in wor&s;hip, 'till in, or near the even|ing, when &s;ome of the church got into a labour with one of their brethren, upon &s;ome of his moral conduct, which they judged not to be agreeable to rule: and at length he was brought to confe&s;s it, which gave as vi&s;ible a quick|ning to their minds, as the other declaration had a damp: and a leading brother in the church being much overcome, took hold of Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> (who was expected before to be their mini&s;ter) and told him he was the man to go before them; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here note, this has not been our common <HI>method.</HI></NOTE> and all concurred therewith: and he was ordain|ed <HI>Dec.</HI> 10. 1746. and he mini&s;tred in word and ordinan|ces to them, 'till the &s;pring 1749. Then he went off and left his flock; for which, after various labours with him, he was, by the advice of a council, excommunicated on <HI>July</HI> 20. 1750. as I had the account in a letter from a member of the council &s;oon after, which letter is now be|fore me. Three or four years afterwards, Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> re|turned and confe&s;t his fault to the church, and they for|gave him. The man al&s;o who made that <HI>declaration,</HI> has al&s;o &s;een clearly &s;ince how he was impo&s;ed upon then, as I have rea&s;on to think, from the account he gave me of it, &s;ome years ago.</P>

<P>Now reader thou art to judge for thy &s;elf. I have joined i&s;&s;ue with Mr. <HI>Fi&s;h,</HI> that
<Q>the church of Chri&s;t in which his &s;pirit dwells, has never been a <HI>bitter, fierce, revenge|ful, per&s;ecuting</HI> church: but the rever&s;e.</Q>
And he has exerted all his learning in an attempt to prove that the &s;tanding churches have that &s;pirit, and that the &s;eparates have the contrary character. And he has advanced it as a principal evidence of their not having the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t, that
<Q>They endeavoured to draw off every <HI>true Chri&s;tian,</HI> and would have left a congregation behind them, of no|thing but <HI>hypocrites</HI> and <HI>gracele&s;s per&s;ons.</HI></Q>
This is brought to prove that they had not a <HI>kind and charitable &s;pirit.</HI> But if he had reviewed a text that &s;tands as a <HI>mott<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> in his title page, which calls him to <HI>mea&s;ure the pattern</HI>; and had ob&s;erved that the rule given to mea&s;ure the <HI>form</HI> and <HI>fa&s;hion</HI> of God's hou&s;e by, with the <HI>goings out</HI> and <HI>comings in thereof,</HI> is, that, <HI>The whole limit thereof round about</HI> &s;hall be, MOST HOLY: <HI>behold,</HI> THIS <HI>is the law of the hou&s;e.</HI> Ezek. 43.10&mdash;12. And al&s;o had taken notice, that the terms given to another prophet, upon which alone he &s;hould be God's <HI>mouth,</HI> were, <HI>If thou take forth the pre|cious from the vile.</HI> (Jer. 15.19.) And that the <HI>holy &s;pirit</HI> expre&s;sly commands us in the new te&s;tament, to <HI>Come out and be &s;eparate from unbelievers</HI>; and to <HI>turn away from</HI> tho&s;e who have the <HI>form,</HI> but <HI>deny the power of godline&s;s.</HI> 2.

fir&s;t of pa&s;&s;ing over what Mr. <HI>Fi&s;h</HI> has &s;aid upon it, without notice; but for &s;everal rea&s;ons I have altered my mind, and concluded to make a few <HI>remarks</HI> upon that part of his book al&s;o.</P>
<P>And the fir&s;t remark I &s;hall make is, that our author takes the method which many have done before him, and tries fir&s;t to <HI>inflame</HI> peoples natural <HI>pa&s;&s;ions,</HI> and then he is pretty certain to get his argument with them: for he &s;ays,
<Q>The church was always <HI>fond</HI> of her <HI>children,</HI>&mdash;And can we now, without <HI>horror,</HI> indulge the thought, either that Chri&s;t hath ca&s;t them off, of that the church is <HI>become as cruel as the O&s;trich.</HI></Q>
p. 28. And having &s;pent a whole page in &s;uch <HI>exclamations,</HI> he then tells of
<Q>fair|ly arguing the points:</Q>
but if the fir&s;t point is gained, that the bapti&s;ts principles are <HI>horribly cruel,</HI> what room can be left for argument in the affair? for who will under|take to di&s;pute for &s;uch principles? Satan him&s;elf pre|tends <HI>kindne&s;s</HI> and not <HI>cruelty</HI> in his inticements.</P>
<P>It is &s;trange to &s;ee how great and good men, have been <HI>blinded</HI> by this &s;tratagem. Dr. <HI>Mather</HI> tell us, that Mr. <HI>Elliot</HI> publi&s;hed an an&s;wer to Mr. <HI>Norcott</HI> on <HI>bapti&s;m,</HI> and began it with the&s;e lines, viz.
<Q>The book &s;peaks with a voice of a <HI>lamb,</HI> and I think the author is a <HI>godly</HI> tho' erring <HI>brother</HI>; but he acts the cau&s;e of a <HI>roaring lion,</HI> who by all crafty ways, &s;eeketh to devour the poor <HI>lambs</HI> of the flock of Chri&s;t.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Elliot's</HI> life p. 57.</NOTE> Now the <HI>lion</HI> is prai&s;ed for his <HI>&s;tately goings,</HI> but who would dare to come near, or encounter with him, unle&s;s he had <HI>David's</HI> faith? In&s;tead of that, each one is for keeping their di&s;tance, and endea|vouring to &s;ecure them&s;elves and their children again&s;t the <HI>terrible</HI> bea&s;t. Even &s;o great a champion as Mr. <HI>Mitchel,</HI> found his courage fail in this matter. For, when Mr. <HI>Dun&s;tar,</HI> pre&s;ident of <HI>Cambridge</HI> college, embraced the <HI>bap|ti&s;t</HI> principles in 1653, and
<Q>thought him&s;elf under &s;ome obligation to bear his te&s;timony in &s;ome &s;ermons, again&s;t the admini&s;tration of <HI>bapti&s;m</HI> to any <HI>infant</HI> what&s;oever.</Q>
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mitchel's</HI> life p. 67.</NOTE> Mr. <HI>Mitchel,</HI> after he had been to talk with him, found that it cau&s;ed him to <HI>&s;cruple infant bapti&s;m,</HI> which he &s;ays,

<Q>After I came from him, I had a &s;trange experience: I &s;ound hurrying and pre&s;&s;ing &s;ugge&s;tions again&s;t <HI>paedo-bapti&s;m,</HI> and injec|ted &s;cruples and thoughts, whether the other way might not be right, and <HI>infant bapti&s;m,</HI> an invention of men: and whether I might with good con&s;cience baptize chil|dren and the like. And the&s;e thoughts were darted in with &s;ome impre&s;&s;ion, and left a &s;trange confu&s;ion and &s;ickline&s;s upon my &s;pirit. Yet methought, it was not hard to di&s;cern that they were from the EVIL ONE. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> becau&s;e they were rather <HI>inj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed,</HI> hurrying &s;ug|ge&s;tions, than any deliberate thoughts, or bringing any light with them. <HI>Secondly,</HI> becau&s;e they were <HI>unrea|&s;onable</HI>; interrupting me in my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dy for the &s;abbath, and putting my &s;pirit into confu&s;ion, &s;o as I had much ado, to do ought in my &s;ermon. It was not now a time to &s;tudy that matter; but when in the former part of the week, I had given my&s;elf to that &s;tudy, the more I &s;tudied it, the more clear and rational light I &s;aw for <HI>paedo bapti&s;m,</HI> but now the&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions hurried me into <HI>&s;cruples.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Tho' this may have pa&s;&s;ed for good rea&s;oning with ma|ny; yet &s;hould a <HI>bapti&s;t</HI> mini&s;ter own that he had very much <HI>&s;crupled,</HI> whether his way was right or not, but had concluded the <HI>&s;cruples</HI> were from the <HI>evil one,</HI> becau&s;e they were attended with <HI>confu&s;ion</HI> and <HI>darkne&s;s,</HI> rather than <HI>de|liberation</HI> in his mind; and did not come by his own rea|&s;onings, but by means of talking with a <HI>great</HI> and <HI>good</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">For Mr. <HI>Mitchel</HI> e&s;teem'd and honored Mr. <HI>Dun&s;tar</HI> as &s;uch to his dying day, p. 70.</NOTE> man, which happened not to be in the right time in the week, but too near the <HI>&s;abbath</HI>: and that therefore he was <HI>re&s;olved,</HI> that he would have an <HI>argument able to remove a mountain,</HI> before he would recede from a <HI>practice</HI> which had been <HI>received as truth</HI> among his faithful fathers.

in his mind; and we &s;hould heared more about the bapti&s;ts being <HI>wilful</HI> in their way than we have done yet.</P>
<P>The Lord gave this rea&s;on to <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> why they &s;hould not oppre&s;s a &s;tranger, viz. <HI>For ye know the heart of a &s;tranger, &s;eeing ye were &s;trangers in the land of Egypt.</HI> And I find the truth of that word in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e; for I have gone thro' the &s;ame <HI>hurrying</HI> and <HI>darkne&s;s,</HI> upon this point, which Mr. <HI>Mitchel</HI> de&s;cribes, and thought once that I had got clear of it, in the &s;ame way; and al&s;o felt the like <HI>fear</HI> of di&s;puting with others upon it, that he did. Neither was it any creature that &s;topt me at la&s;t, from go|ing on in that way, No, but in my retired hours, this que&s;ti|on was put to my con&s;cience, (I believe) by him who made me,
<Q>where is it, and in what relation to the vi&s;ible church do baptized infants &s;tand, who are not <HI>regenera|ted</HI>?</Q>
This I was not able to an&s;wer; for it was a &s;et|tled point with me before (as it was with Mr. <HI>Mitchel</HI>) that none but <HI>new-born</HI> &s;ouls ought to come to the <HI>Lords-Supper</HI>; and yet <HI>bapti&s;m</HI> is the fir&s;t ordinance in a <HI>chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion,</HI> and his notion of a <HI>middle way,</HI> between the church and the world, I could not ju&s;tify: &s;o that I found the <HI>mountain</HI> to be on the other &s;ide of the que&s;tion; and if Mr. <HI>Hooker,</HI> or any others could have helped me to an <HI>argument</HI> able to <HI>remove it,</HI> I &s;hould have gladly u&s;ed it, rather than to be <HI>turned about</HI> again in this affair; but tho' I &s;ought diligently, by all means within my reach, for twelve months or more, yet I never could find &s;uch an ar|gument. <HI>Solomon</HI> &s;ays, <HI>The heart knoweth its own bit|terne&s;s</HI>: and none but they who have experienced the like, can tell what I then endured; and in&s;tead of help from my brethren, they helped to increa&s;e the burden: for one would &s;ay, It was my li&s;tning to the <HI>bapti&s;ts,</HI> that cau&s;ed all this difficulty: while another would be as confident that it was the <HI>fear of men</HI> that kept me from coming out in <HI>believers bapti&s;m.</HI></P>
<P>Often did I think of <HI>Job's</HI> words, <HI>Were your &s;oul in my &s;ouls &s;tead, I could heap words upon you.</HI> I &s;ee now that the chief thing that held my mind &s;o long in &s;u&s;pence, was not di&s;tingui&s;hing as I ought between <HI>men,</HI> and the <HI>rule it&s;elf.</HI> For when I look'd into the <HI>word,</HI> I could read be|lievers bapti&s;m plainly, and nothing plainly of bringing in|fants thereto; but when I turned to look among <HI>men,</HI> &s;o many <HI>good</HI> ones would be brought up on one &s;ide, and <HI>bad</HI> ones on the other, and I &s;aw &s;o much of a wrong <HI>temper</HI> in my <HI>bapti&s;t</HI> brethren who had come out lately, that I &s;aid

<P>An&s;wer, It is to be lamented that the&s;e evils too much prevail in all parts of the land, among all denominations; but I have rea&s;on to think there is a con&s;iderable reforma|tion, on the&s;e accounts, among the bapti&s;ts lately. O may there be much more! A few con&s;iderations on <HI>family pray|er,</HI> which I thought duty to publi&s;h two years ago, were at their de&s;ire printed a <HI>Newport,</HI> and have been kindly received in that <HI>colony</HI>; for which I am bound to give thanks to God. And I hope my fathers and brethren, will yet be more engaged by an agreeable walk, to cut off oc|ca&s;ion from them who de&s;ire occa&s;ion, and give evidence to all, that believers bapti&s;m has no natural tendency to make people neglect the duties of private or public religion: The joining of the&s;e evils with the very name of a <HI>bapti&s;t,</HI> has long been an engine to guard peoples minds again&s;t looking into their true &s;entiments; whereas there is no more natural relation between tho&s;e evils, and our princi|ple about <HI>bapti&s;m,</HI> than there is between true <HI>learning</HI> and a <HI>haughty per&s;ecuting</HI> behaviour, which have often been put together on the other hand. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The &s;entiments of our <HI>bapti&s;t</HI> brethren in <HI>England,</HI> who have had long experience in the&s;e things, as they were publi&s;hed in a <HI>letter of advice</HI> to their brethern, from an a&s;&s;embly of 15 churches, met at <HI>Burton</HI> in <HI>Gloce&s;ter&s;hire</HI> Aug. 16. 1765, I will give a little extract from.&mdash;
<Q>Take care of &s;tretching your family wor|&s;hip to an unrea&s;onable length, or performing it un&s;ea&s;onably: let it not be defer'd too late in the morning, le&s;t your hearts &s;hould be engaged in the hurries of bu&s;ine&s;s, and entangled in the cares of the world; nor put it off till the la&s;t thing in the evening, le&s;t you &s;hould be overcome with drow&s;ine&s;s, and thus yawn out a prayer, in&s;tead of groaning out one.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Be &s;trict in ob&s;erving the weekly day of re&s;t, and not content|ed with attending upon public wor&s;hip, let it be the &s;abbath of the Lord in all your dwellings: Keep your children and &s;er|vants much under your eye: in&s;i&s;t upon their remembering &s;omething of what they have heard: put them upon reading the &s;criptures; what is above their capacities explain to them, and clo&s;e the day with recommending them to God.</Q></P></NOTE></P>
<P>Upon a clo&s;e view, I am fully convinced that our fathers were greatly mi&s;taken in this matter, and the effects plainly evidence it; for, 1. How often can we hear the&s;e children of the church making remarks on the loo&s;e walk of pro|fe&s;&s;ors,
<PB N="108" REF="010823_0055_0F81D3FF6E4830B8">
but if they are turned to their own walk, they are ready to reply, <HI>I am no profe&s;&s;or</HI>; plainly &s;uppo&s;ing that their <HI>obligation</HI> to regard divine rule, depends on their <HI>own act</HI>; for they naturally imagine that they have as good a right to act for them&s;elves <HI>now,</HI> as their parents had to act for them in <HI>infancy. Paul,</HI> when &s;peaking to <HI>heathens,</HI> re|minded them that we are the <HI>offspring of God,</HI> and there|fore are under <HI>indi&s;pen&s;ible obligations</HI> to <HI>&s;eek him,</HI> and act as <HI>depend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt</HI> creatures on <HI>him in</HI> whom <HI>we live,</HI> and <HI>move, and have our being.</HI> Act. 17 &mdash; 27.29. And he urges on <HI>chri&s;tians,</HI> the importance of giving <HI>more earne&s;t heed,</HI> to the things revea|led in the go&s;pel, from the con&s;ideration of the <HI>greatne&s;s</HI> of the things in them&s;elves; the <HI>evidence</HI> they come with; the <HI>im|portance</HI> of them to us, and the <HI>account</HI> we mu&s;t give for them, or for our <HI>neglect</HI> of them. Heb. 2.1 &mdash; 3. The&s;e are &s;triking con&s;iderations indeed: but to fix the <HI>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gation</HI> upon an <HI>act</HI> that is never expre&s;&s;ed in the whole bible, has rather a tendency to guard again&s;t conviction, than to cau&s;e a true &s;en&s;e of duty; e&s;pecially if we ob&s;erve, 2. That when people have a few <HI>out&s;ide</HI> things, they are apt to think that they are, either <HI>&s;afe,</HI> or in a <HI>fair way</HI> for it: which is exactly the founda|tion error of the <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> who were <HI>blind,</HI> becau&s;e they did not FIRST clean&s;e that which is <HI>within,</HI> that the <HI>out&s;ide</HI> might be <HI>clean al&s;o.</HI> Matt: 23.26 Many have &s;een the dan|ger of this, who at the &s;ame time did not &s;ee how their principles would lead to it. Mr. <HI>Willard</HI> of <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> after a long di&s;cour&s;e upon <HI>renewing covenant,</HI> in the year 1680. wherein were included <HI>parents</HI> and their <HI>children,</HI> yet &s;ays,
<Q>To con&s;ide in the&s;e <HI>outward</HI> enjoyments, as if they were <HI>real</HI> a&s;&s;urances of God's complacency, is not <HI>&s;aith</HI> but <HI>pre&s;umption</HI>: &mdash;And yet, &s;ays he, what more common then for the children of men thus to <HI>delude</HI> them&s;elves with &s;uch opinions?

An&s;wer, &s;everal who have formerly &s;ent their &s;ons to col|lege, have been di&s;appointed, as the clergy have found means to draw them over to their party; which has di&s;|couraged others from &s;ending their &s;ons.

<P>In order to &s;hew how poorly furni&s;hed our churches are with <HI>teachers,</HI> Mr. <HI>F.</HI> tells a &s;tory of his conver&s;ing with one of them, who held that tho&s;e words, <HI>Drink ye all of it,</HI> proved that they mu&s;t eat and drink <HI>up all</HI> the elements, that are &s;et apart for the <HI>Lord's-&s;upper</HI>: and repre&s;ents it as the <HI>common practice</HI> among our churches. p. 101. In an&s;wer to this.

<P>Having given &s;uch an account of the bapti&s;t, he con|cludes, that many <HI>good things</HI> are <HI>lo&s;t,</HI> and no good thing gained by going over to them, unle&s;s theirs is the <HI>only &s;crip|tural mode.</HI> Upon this he &s;ays,

<Q>This text affords not the <HI>lea&s;t &s;hadow</HI> of proof for <HI>plunging.</HI></Q>
p. 105.

<P>And <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> I would a&s;k this teacher how he came to act as he &s;ays we <HI>learned enemies,</HI> who <HI>make havock of the church,</HI> do? who&s;e language according to his own account, p. 176, is,
<Q>You don't rightly under&s;tand your bible: 'tis <HI>thus</HI> and <HI>&s;o</HI> in the <HI>original</HI>; the meaning of <HI>this</HI> and <HI>that</HI> text, is not as you take it; but ju&s;t the rever&s;e, or very different.</Q>
He a&s;ks whether we mu&s;t not run back to the <HI>&s;tanding churches</HI> for help in &s;uch a ca&s;e? I believe not; but I will tell him what I have once done. When the mini&s;ters of <HI>Norwich</HI> and one from <HI>Pre&s;ton,</HI> joined and made &s;ome <HI>ad|ditions</HI> to Mr. <HI>Dickin&s;on's dialogue,</HI> and got it reprinted, I &s;ent one of them to Dr. <HI>Gill,</HI> who had an&s;wered the dia|logue before; but when he ob&s;erved that they have added in page 5, that "St. <HI>Irenaus,</HI> who lived about 14 years af|ter Chri&s;t; &mdash;&s;ays in his epi&s;tle ad Rom. lib. 5.

The doctor ordered an adverti&s;ement to be in&s;erted at the end of one of his books, wherein, after mentioning this pa&s;&s;age, he

<P>A <HI>&s;econd</HI> que&s;tion I would a&s;k is, how our author and his brethren came to depart in this ca&s;e, from the general rule, of <HI>interpreting ob&s;cure</HI> places by tho&s;e which are plain? It is well known that the meaning of words is mo&s;t plain, where they are u&s;ed in their <HI>literal</HI> &s;en&s;e, and commonly, but part of their meaning is refer'd to, when u&s;ed in a <HI>figurative</HI> way. As for in&s;tance, the metaphor of a <HI>thief,</HI> and of an <HI>unju&s;t judge</HI> is refer'd to by our Lord, to &s;hew the <HI>&s;uddenne&s;s</HI> of his coming, and the <HI>prevalence</HI> of <HI>impor|tunity</HI>: but what bla&s;phemer will dare to apply the whole meaning of tho&s;e words either to the Father or to the Son? yet in the ca&s;e before us, all arts are u&s;ed to <HI>darken</HI> texts which &s;peak of <HI>bapti&s;m</HI> in the <HI>literal</HI> &s;en&s;e, and then we are turned to places where the word is u&s;ed in a <HI>figurative</HI> way, in order to decide its true meaning. The <HI>overwhelming</HI> &s;orrow of Chri&s;t; and his di&s;ciples being <HI>filled</HI> with the ho|ly Gho&s;t, are called <HI>bapti&s;ms</HI>; and Mr. <HI>F.</HI> would point us only to the <HI>way</HI> or <HI>manner</HI> of its <HI>coming,</HI> and not to their being <HI>filled</HI> or <HI>overwhelmed</HI> therein, and then &s;ays,
<Q>There was <HI>nothing</HI> in either of tho&s;e <HI>bapti&s;ms,</HI> that &s;o much as <HI>look'd like dipping.</HI></Q>

Thus he denies what <HI>is</HI> in the bible; but at other times would have us read what never <HI>was</HI> there: for in the &s;ame page he refers us to Mr. <HI>Dickin&s;on's</HI> dialogue, who in &s;peaking of <HI>I&s;rael's</HI> being <HI>baptized</HI> to <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> leaves out all the circum|&s;tances of their going <HI>into,</HI> and coming <HI>out of,</HI> the &s;ea, and having the waters on <HI>each hand,</HI> and the cloud <HI>over them</HI>: I &s;ay, he leaves all the&s;e out, and then tells us of
<Q>rain from the cloud,</Q>
which the bible &s;peaks nothing of. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s the&s;e men who are &s;o much confin'd to what <HI>they</HI> have <HI>written,</HI> in their teaching, can <HI>read</HI> to the people what <HI>God</HI> never <HI>wrote</HI> in his word!</P>
<P>My <HI>third</HI> que&s;tion is this; Can they find one in&s;tance that God ever in&s;tituted an ordinance without &s;hewing the <HI>manner</HI> how it &s;hould be perform'd? will they &s;ay that Chri&s;t appointed the <HI>matter</HI> of the ordinance of the &s;upper to be bread and wine, but left the church to <HI>decree rites and ceremonies</HI> concerning the <HI>manner</HI> of its performance?

I pre&s;ume none will &s;ay it would.

<P>And let me a&s;k tho&s;e who hold that if <HI>water</HI> is u&s;ed in the &s;acred name 'tis bapti&s;m, tho' it be done by <HI>&s;prinkling</HI> or <HI>pouring,</HI> whether they think <HI>Paul</HI> under&s;tood what he &s;aid when he calls bapti&s;m a <HI>burial</HI>? Rom. 6.4, 5. In|deed Mr. <HI>Dickin&s;on</HI> &s;ays,
<Q>It is mo&s;t evident that this text has no reference at all to,&mdash;any particular <HI>mode</HI> of ad|mini&s;tring that ordinance, but the plain manife&s;t &s;cope of the words, is to &s;hew us our <HI>obligation</HI> by <HI>bapti&s;m,</HI> unto a conformity to the death and re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t, by <HI>dying unto &s;in,</HI> and <HI>ri&s;ing again unto newne&s;s of life.</HI></Q>
An&s;wer, 'tis readily granted that this is his &s;cope; but do they &s;uppo&s;e that learned <HI>Paul</HI> had &s;uch a &s;cope with him as to u&s;e <HI>words</HI> without any reference to their true <HI>mean|ing</HI>? Common people know, that when they <HI>bury</HI> a man they never expect to &s;ee him return to his <HI>old way of living</HI> again; and that when they <HI>plant</HI> corn they expect its next appearance will be by a <HI>new growth</HI>: and how &s;tricking from hence is the argument to engage <HI>baptized</HI> believers to walk in <HI>newne&s;s of life</HI>? But now, for&s;ooth, <HI>Paul</HI> mu&s;t be thought to apply the words <HI>buried</HI> and <HI>planted</HI> to bap|ti&s;m, when <HI>&s;prinkled</HI> and <HI>wa&s;hed,</HI> would have done as well or better! &s;uch advances have men made in <HI>learning</HI> &s;ince <HI>Paul's</HI> day!</P>
<P>Before we leave this point, I would a&s;k the&s;e learned gen|tlemen how they came to know which <HI>part</HI> of the body they &s;hould apply water to? Circumci&s;ion was in a <HI>&s;ecret part,</HI> and they often tell us that bapti&s;m comes in its room. If <HI>wa&s;hing</HI> be bapti&s;m, Je&s;us <HI>wa&s;hed</HI> his di&s;ciples <HI>feet,</HI> but I don't read that he wa&s;hed their <HI>face</HI>: how then did they come to know that <HI>&s;prinkling</HI> the <HI>face</HI> was bapti&s;m?</P>

<P N="1">1.

Rom. 14.5, 22, 23. Yet modern <HI>charity</HI> will <HI>condemn</HI> all who dare to think and act contrary to the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion. Every &s;oul that ventures to &s;ee with its own eyes; &s;o far as they di&s;cover and act upon truth, they like <HI>Noah</HI> do therein condemn all the world who act contrary thereto; which renews the old complaint, <HI>Thou reproache&s;t us al&s;o.</HI> And what then? Mr. <HI>F.</HI> con|demns us as much as we do him. No, &s;ays he, we are not <HI>obliged</HI> nor <HI>di&s;po&s;ed</HI> to treat them with like <HI>&s;everity:</HI> but if we read on, we &s;hall find he has told the world that he has proved <HI>beyond contradiction</HI> that we are wrong, and has <HI>fairly &s;ilenced</HI> us, and therefore has warned all not to hear us any more: and what &s;eparate or bapti&s;t in <HI>New-Eng|land,</HI> has done more or &s;o much as this towards unchurch|ing any other &s;ect what&s;oever?</P>
<P>Will he admit any into his community without he thinks they are baptized; or without they will conform to the <HI>orders</HI> of his church? I believe not.

<P>It was God's expre&s;s command, that three times in the year all the males in his antient church, &s;hould appear be|fore him; the la&s;t of which times was at the fea&s;t of <HI>taber|nacles,</HI> which took its name from the <HI>mode</HI> which he order|ed it to be kept in, viz.

The&s;e things if rightly viewed, would &s;weep off abundance of &s;tuff that is brought up in our day, to frighten people from <HI>&s;eeing</HI> the truth, or from <HI>acting</HI> upon it when 'tis &s;een.</P>
<P>Dare any pretend that they have equa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> evidence of the divine pre&s;ence in &s;prinkling for bapti&s;m, with what <HI>I&s;rael</HI> had at that fea&s;t? or that any have practi&s;ed it, who equal|led <HI>David</HI> for <HI>devotion,</HI> or <HI>Solomon</HI> for <HI>wi&s;dom</HI>? yet the poor captives who returned from <HI>Babylon</HI> were not deter'd by &s;uch great characters, from returning to an a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ct con|formity to divine rule. 4. As the bapti&s;ts are often repre|&s;ented as the mo&s;t <HI>rigid</HI> of all &s;ects, I will briefly touch up|on &s;ome plain evidences to the contrary. The reader may remember how &s;hockingly Mr. <HI>Robbins</HI> of <HI>Branford</HI> was treated by the <HI>con&s;ociation</HI> for his preaching among the <HI>bapti&s;ts.</HI> And tho' the &s;eparates &s;et out, and for &s;ome years practi&s;ed free communion with the bapti&s;ts, and the bars were broken down, &s;o that they were admitted to free and &s;ucce&s;sful labors in many bapti&s;t &s;ocieties, and they went on comfortably together, 'till by this freedom many were brought into &s;uch an acquaintance with the bapti&s;t prin|ciples, as to embrace and practice them; yet that made a great difficulty, and &s;everal were cen&s;ured by churches and councils, for leaving infant bapti&s;m: upon which many at|tempts were made for accommodation, 'till at length a bap|ti&s;t elder refu&s;ed to act in an ordination with an elder of the other denomination, becau&s;e he thought that elder had in &s;everal in&s;tances injured the bapti&s;ts and their principles. This cau&s;ed hard contention between the two elders, and they joined and called all the&s;e churches together, to hear the affair: which was the large&s;t meeting we ever had &s;ince the beginning of the &s;eparation.</P>
<P>The meeting was at <HI>Stonington</HI> on May 29, 1754, where the me&s;&s;engers of about 35 churches came together; and labored in conference upon the&s;e affairs three days; and in the clo&s;e of the meeting, &s;everal of the mo&s;t noted leaders on the &s;ide of the paedo-bapti&s;ts openly declared that tho' they could yet commune with &s;aints who did <HI>not &s;ee</HI> light for infant bapti&s;m; yet they did withdraw the hand of fel|low&s;hip from all &s;uch as profe&s;&s;ed <HI>to &s;ee</HI> that there was no warrant for bringing infants to that ordinance. And thus the breach appeared before the world to be on that &s;ide.</P>

<P>A few le&s;&s;ons of in&s;truction mu&s;t clo&s;e the whole.</P>
<P N="1">1.

and behavior, we thereby contract guilt to our&s;elves, and injure our fellow men. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To give a plain illu&s;tration of my meaning. I will mention an in&s;tance which equally cuts both ways. In our former di&s;|putes concerning bapti&s;m, I heard one advance it as a motive to embrace the bapti&s;t principles, that thereby providence had opened a door for a relea&s;e from a burden of taxes: and the &s;ame day I heard another of equal note &s;ay, The bapti&s;t principles might be right, and he did not know but he &s;hould conform to them if he liv'd among them, but it would not do to make an <HI>overturn</HI> about it among us. I was then at a lo&s;s in the affair; But this made my &s;oul cry, Alas where are we! that <HI>intere&s;t</HI> &s;hould be advanced as an argument, for a principle as truth, and <HI>honour</HI> as an argument again&s;t it! Each party can readily &s;ee corruption on the other &s;ide; yet alas! how little faithful <HI>charity</HI> is exer|ci&s;ed, to di&s;tingui&s;h between <HI>truth,</HI> and the <HI>corruptions</HI> and <HI>infir|mities</HI> of tho&s;e who profe&s;s it?</NOTE></P>
<P N="3">3. Let none indulge the imagination of being <HI>neuters</HI> in this ca&s;e: for all heaven is engaged <HI>for</HI> truth, and all hell <HI>again&s;t</HI> it; and this world is <HI>divided</HI> between them; &s;o that HE who is the <HI>truth</HI> and the <HI>life,</HI> &s;ays, He that is not with me, is again&s;t me; and he that <HI>gathereth not with me, &s;cattereth abroad.</HI> Mat. 12.30.

<P N="4">4. Learn what is the real cau&s;e of all the <HI>di&s;orders</HI> in the world.

<P>And whenever the power of God is remarkably di&s;play|ed, to turn men from darkne&s;s to light, and from the pow|er of &s;atan unto God; a loud noi&s;e is &s;oon rai&s;ed about <HI>di&s;orders, delu&s;ions</HI> and <HI>imprudencies</HI>; and all arts are u&s;ed to blind peoples minds, and to &s;ettle them back into carnal &s;ecurity again. And no &s;tratagem of the enemy has been more &s;ucce&s;sful, than to mix and confound error with truth, in chri&s;tians experiences, conver&s;ation, and conduct: and when their corruptions are di&s;covered, &s;inners and hypocrites catch at them: for God &s;ays, They <HI>eat up</HI> the <HI>&s;in</HI> of <HI>my people,</HI> and they <HI>&s;et their heart on their iniquity</HI>&punc; Ho&s;. 4.8. And the de&s;troyer of &s;ouls would per&s;uade them, that there is nothing in religion: or if there is &s;ome reality therein, yet that common people can't di&s;cern the difference, and therefore mu&s;t be directed by &s;uch as know better than they. In order to accompli&s;h this end, many who would be thought to know much, have often pretend|ed to di&s;cern di&s;tinctions, where others can &s;ee no differ|ence; while things which are really di&s;tinct in their nature, are confounded together. This wickedne&s;s has been as wretchedly practi&s;ed by &s;ome, under the pretence of <HI>&s;piri|tual teaching,</HI> as it has by others under the name of <HI>great learning.</HI></P>
<P>It is a fact not to be di&s;puted, that &s;ome men know more, and &s;ee further than others do, both in natural, and in &s;piritual things; but when real or pretended knowledge, is u&s;ed to keep others in ignorance, and to excite a high opinion of them&s;elves, in&s;tead of laboring to enlighten and benefit others; that is a certain token of &s;uch per&s;ons being en&s;nared by, if they are not under the full power <HI>of,</HI> the <HI>wi&s;dom</HI> which is <HI>from beneath.</HI> For when there was much
<PB N="122" REF="010823_0062_0F81D406309299D0">
murmuring among the common people, concerning HIM who &s;pake as no mere man ever did: &s;ome &s;aying <HI>He is a good man,</HI> others &s;aying, <HI>Nay, but he deceiveth the people</HI>: He was &s;o far from checking their attempt to form a judg|ment of &s;uch matters, that he gave them an infallible rule to judge upon: viz. <HI>He that &s;peaketh of him&s;elf, &s;eeketh his own glory: but he that &s;eeketh his glory that &s;ent him, the &s;ame is true, and no unrighteou&s;ne&s;s in him.</HI> John 7.18, But as tho&s;e who have a <HI>right</HI> to judge, yet many times don't judge <HI>right</HI>; therefore he lays down two important le&s;&s;ons in the affair. One is, not to act as unconcerned <HI>&s;pec|tators,</HI> but as per&s;ons really engaged to <HI>practice</HI> what they know. <HI>If any man will</HI> DO <HI>his will, he &s;hall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I &s;peak of my&s;elf.</HI> The other le&s;&s;on is, not to <HI>judge</HI> in a &s;uperficial manner, by the <HI>appearance</HI> and &s;hew which is made, but to <HI>judge righteous judgment</HI>; to &s;earch carefully into the truth and reality of things.</P>
<P>Thus the &s;on of God plainly held forth the right which common people ever have to judge, both of the <HI>doctrine</HI> and <HI>conduct</HI> of <HI>teachers</HI>; and the <HI>meek he will guide in judg|ment,</HI> while tho&s;e who receive not the <HI>love of the truth,</HI> but have <HI>plea&s;ure in unrighteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> are con&s;tantly expo&s;ed to be given over to <HI>&s;trong delu&s;ions.</HI> This being the <HI>order</HI> of Chri&s;t's kingdom; hence &s;ee what a <HI>di&s;order</HI> it makes, when common chri&s;tians are denied the free liberty of examining their teachers, and of acting according to their judgments in the affair; and al&s;o that 'tis a great <HI>di&s;order</HI> to condemn and reproach any teachers, only becau&s;e they are not owned by <HI>rulers</HI> or <HI>learned mini&s;ters</HI>: for by this very rule, our glorious Lord was condemned as a <HI>deceiver,</HI> and his fol|lowers &s;tigmatized as <HI>ignorant cur&s;ed people,</HI> by men who were as famous in the world's e&s;teem, for <HI>learning, devoti|on,</HI> and <HI>order,</HI> as any in our day, ver. 47&mdash;49. Nor is the <HI>di&s;order</HI> le&s;s on the other hand, when any under a pretence of <HI>&s;pecial teachings,</HI> and <HI>divine influence,</HI> croud their im|provements upon tho&s;e who are not edifyed thereby, and plead their right &s;o to do, becau&s;e they &s;ee further than others, who they &s;ay can't di&s;cern where they are: tho' (it may be) &s;erious chri&s;tians <HI>do &s;ee</HI> them at the &s;ame time, conduct in a <HI>fle&s;h-plea&s;ing</HI> way, and even not providing things <HI>hone&s;t in the &s;ight of men.</HI></P>
<P>Some &s;uch <HI>&s;pots</HI> and <HI>blemi&s;hes</HI> have cau&s;ed the greate&s;t di&s;orders that I have ever known among any of our chur|ches;
<PB N="123" REF="010823_0062_0F81D406309299D0">
and a principal rea&s;on of &s;ome &s;uch per&s;ons being left to go on, &s;o far as they have in &s;uch a way, was a fear in humble &s;ouls of &s;peaking evil (as many have done) of <HI>things they know not</HI>: and we ought always to be cautions in that re&s;pect, for 'tis like &s;hooting in the dark, where we may be as likely to wound a friend as an enemy. What we know to be right, we ought to own, and to di&s;own what we know to be wrong, and leave other things 'till they are opened to us.

<P>It is an important part of <HI>go&s;pel order,</HI> to have every member encouraged in the improvement of the gifts which are given them; but for any to pretend, they have got &s;o far out of &s;ight of the lea&s;t &s;aint, either by human or di|vine teachings, that the &s;aint can't under&s;tand them, when they properly improve their gifts, is as ab&s;urd as to tell of a <HI>candle &s;hining &s;o bright as not to give light unto all that are in the hou&s;e.</HI> Mat. 5.15.

Wherein my name is mentioned, and a few &s;trokes are giv|en upon my <HI>letter</HI> to Mr. <HI>Lord.</HI> I &s;hall therefore add a brief reply thereto in this place. His text is, 1 Cor. 7.14.

Thus in a plain prophecy of go&s;pel privileges and ble&s;&s;ings it is &s;aid, <HI>In that day, &s;hall there be upon the bells of the hor&s;es, holine&s;s unto the Lord;&mdash;Yea, every pot in Jeru&s;alem and in</HI> Judah <HI>&s;hall be holine&s;s unto the Lord of ho&s;ts,</HI> Zech. 14.20, 21. Which words I &s;uppo&s;e intend the &s;ame thing that <HI>Paul</HI> expre&s;&s;ed, in this very epi&s;tle, (after he had declared that tho&s;e things were <HI>lawful</HI> to chri&s;tians which were <HI>unclean</HI> to the Jews,) <HI>Whether therefore ye eat or drink, or what&s;oever ye do, do all to the glory of God.</HI> 1. Cor. 10.31. So he &s;ays in 1 Tim. 4&punc;4, 5. <HI>Every creature of God is good,&mdash;for it is &s;anctified by the word of God, and prayer,</HI> i. e. His word gives chri&s;tians a <HI>warrant</HI> to take them, and by prayer they receive a <HI>ble&s;&s;ing</HI> in the u&s;e of them.</P>
<P>Now in my letter to Mr. <HI>Lord,</HI> I gave it as my mind, that this third &s;en&s;e of the words <HI>&s;anctified</HI> and <HI>holy,</HI> was the true intent of them in the text before us: and that the <HI>Co|rinthians</HI> writing to the apo&s;tle upon this affair (ver. 1.) was doubtle&s;s occa&s;ioned by their reading in Ezra 10.3. That the <HI>Jews</HI> were obliged to <HI>put away all the wives, and &s;uch as was born of them,</HI> which they had taken of other nations, that were not of their religion: which might na|turally cau&s;e an enquiry, whether they mu&s;t do &s;o now or not? And the an&s;wer is in the negative, for the unbelie|ving mate is <HI>&s;anctified,</HI> and their children <HI>holy.</HI> And Mr. <HI>Fo&s;ter</HI> entirely concurs with my &s;en&s;e of the occa&s;ion of the words, and al&s;o as to the meaning of the word <HI>&s;anctified</HI>; but he would have the word <HI>holy</HI> taken in the &s;econd &s;en&s;e which was given above; and the only rea&s;on that he gives
<PB N="125" REF="010823_0063_0F81D406E9BFBE80">
for differing from me in that re&s;pect p. 8. is,
<Q>That the unbelieving party is not &s;aid to be &s;anctified in relation to God but only in relation to the believing yoke-fel|low.</Q>
But he &s;ays, children are holy,
<Q>not in relation to any other but God only.</Q></P>
<P>Upon which I would ob&s;erve, that 'tis very evident in the text, that the childrens being holy, is the <HI>effect</HI> of the parents being &s;anctified, &s;o that here we are pre&s;ented with a number of ab&s;urdities. As 1. an <HI>effect</HI> which ri&s;eth above its <HI>cau&s;e.</HI> 2. With a ca&s;e of con&s;cience, which was occa|&s;ioned by a text in <HI>Ezra,</HI> that obliged the <HI>Jews</HI> to put away their <HI>wives,</HI> and &s;uch as were <HI>born of them,</HI> as <HI>equally un|clean</HI>; and yet the an&s;wer to it is declared, to mean &s;ome|thing <HI>higher</HI> in the child than in the parent it &s;prang from. For Mr. <HI>Fo&s;ter</HI> &s;ays, the unbelieving parents being
<Q>de&s;ti|tute of the &s;anctifying graces of the holy &s;pirit of God, are unfit for communion with him.</Q>
p. 5. Yet in the &s;ame page after &s;aying,
<Q>The children of believers are as others, born in &s;in, and by <HI>nature</HI> children of wrath;</Q>
he goes on to &s;ay,
<Q>They are vi&s;ibly &s;anctified, being &s;et apart for God:</Q>
and declares,
<Q>It is &s;uch a &s;anctification or holine&s;s as is intended, when the church and people of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> are called holy; P&s;al. 50.5. Gather my <HI>&s;aints</HI> together unto me, tho&s;e that have made a covenant with me by &s;acrifice.</Q>
Here <HI>old &s;inners</HI> are declared to be <HI>unfit</HI> for communion with God, while 'tis a&s;&s;erted that <HI>young ones</HI> who are <HI>born in &s;in,</HI> are &s;et apart for him! 3. We have a <HI>&s;elf-contradiction</HI>; for in p. 4. Mr. <HI>Fo&s;ter</HI> refer|ing to Ezra 10.3. &s;ays,
<Q>'Tis ju&s;t that tho&s;e actions that are done again&s;t <HI>law,</HI> &s;hould be accounted not only <HI>un|lawful,</HI> but <HI>null.</HI>&mdash;But it was otherwi&s;e with tho&s;e to whom the apo&s;tle wrote; for they were <HI>lawful</HI> man and wife; their marriage not being <HI>prohibited,</HI> they might not be <HI>parted,</HI> and their children not unclean, but holy.</Q>
Yet in page 7 when he is oppo&s;ing Dr. <HI>Gill,</HI> he &s;ays,
<Q>The que&s;tion propounded by the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> was not whe|ther a believing hu&s;band and unbelieving wife, were <HI>lawful</HI> man and wife together? No body <HI>doubted that.</HI></Q></P>
<P>However I will not wa&s;te paper, nor abu&s;e the reader with remarks upon all the &s;tuff which his &s;ermon abounds with; but would ju&s;t ob&s;erve, that the new-te&s;tament cer|tainly gives the &s;ame &s;en&s;e of the&s;e terms, <HI>&s;anctified</HI> and holy, el&s;e where, as we do here; and tho&s;e who give the other &s;en&s;e of them are forced, all of them, to borrow it from the <HI>national church</HI> in the old te&s;tament; and Mr.
<PB N="126" REF="010823_0064_0F81D409B36E4280">
<HI>For&s;ter</HI> &s;ays,
<Q>I freely own that I know no other difference, betwixt a national church and a congregational church, but one is great, and the other little.</Q>
p. 20. If all would come out &s;o plain, we &s;hould hope to &s;ee the contro|ver&s;y &s;oon brought to an i&s;&s;ue: for the fir&s;t con&s;titution of the national church, in <HI>Abraham's hou&s;hold,</HI> is very expre&s;s; the <HI>covenant</HI> included every <HI>man-child</HI> that was <HI>b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rn in his hou&s;e, and bought with his money of the &s;tranger.</HI> The&s;e were all in that covenant, and therefore were to have the <HI>token</HI> of it admini&s;tred upon them. <HI>Circumci&s;ion</HI> did not bring them into covenant; natural birth or purcha&s;e brought them in, and being in, if there was one &s;oul of them that continued without the token of the covenant, God &s;aid, <HI>That &s;oul &s;hall be cut off from his people: he hath broken my covenant.</HI> Gen. 17.13, 14, 27. And when the <HI>pa&s;&s;over</HI> was in&s;tituted in that church, the Lord &s;aid, <HI>every man's &s;ervant that is bought for money, when thou ha&s;t cir|cumci&s;ed him,</HI> THEN <HI>&s;hall he eat thereof.</HI> Exod. 12.44.</P>
<P>No words could be more plain than the&s;e are, to de&s;cribe the exact limits of the national church; yet Mr. <HI>Dickin&s;on</HI> a&s;&s;erts, that the patent &s;ealed by bapti&s;m, is
<Q>The very &s;ame <HI>parchment</HI> that was given to <HI>Abraham</HI>:</Q>
and Mr. <HI>Fi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Fo&s;ter</HI> concur in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e. But if &s;o, then out of their own mouths they are condemned; for in&s;tead of excluding <HI>half</HI> the &s;ubjects, as they tell us of, they ex|clude more than a <HI>hundred</HI> to <HI>one. Abraham,</HI> before this, had 118 &s;ervants, <HI>born in his own hou&s;e,</HI> who were fit for <HI>&s;oldiers.</HI> Gen. 14.14. And <HI>in the &s;elf-&s;ame day</HI> that this covenant was made with him, he <HI>circumci&s;ed his &s;on</HI> and ALL <HI>the</HI> MEN <HI>of his hou&s;e.</HI> Here was but <HI>one</HI> of his <HI>own &s;eed</HI> to &s;uch a great <HI>hou&s;hold,</HI> (but now their plea is, only for little children.) And if we view the antitype, we may &s;ee as plain a de&s;cription of the go&s;pel church. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;hews to the <HI>Ephe&s;ians,</HI> that Chri&s;t had <HI>broken down the middle wall of partition between</HI> them and the <HI>Jews,</HI> and came and <HI>preached peace</HI> to both, whereby their <HI>enmity was &s;lain</HI>; and <HI>thro' him they both had acce&s;s by one &s;pirit unto the Father,</HI> and were <HI>fellow-citizens with the &s;aints, and of the</HI> HOUSHOLD OF GOD; <HI>and were built upon the foundation of the apo&s;tles and prophets, Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf being the chief corner-&s;tone,</HI> Eph. 2.14&mdash;20</P>
<P>Now if Mr. <HI>Fo&s;ter</HI> knows of no other difference between the&s;e two churches but only what re&s;pects their <HI>number,</HI> I would de&s;ire him to go to &s;chool with <HI>Nicodemus,</HI> and learn the difference betwixt being <HI>born of the fle&s;h,</HI> and a being
<PB N="127" REF="010823_0064_0F81D409B36E4280">
<HI>born of the &s;pirit.</HI> In my letter, I had ob&s;erved that the <HI>oracles of God</HI> were <HI>committed to the Jews,</HI> and many means were u&s;ed for the conver&s;ion of members <HI>within</HI> the church: whereas now, the go&s;pel is freely <HI>preached to all nations,</HI> and the <HI>lively &s;tones,</HI> which are the materials of this <HI>&s;piri|tual hou&s;e,</HI> which is the antitype of <HI>Solomon</HI>'s temple, are <HI>prepared without,</HI> before they are <HI>builded together for an habitation of God thro' the &s;pirit.</HI> Upon which Mr. <HI>Fo&s;ter</HI> gives &s;everal cants, and &s;ays, he knows not what I mean, unle&s;s it is, "That there is now no means
<Q>u&s;ed for the conver&s;ion of members within the church.</Q>
p. 21.</P>
<P>But if the ob&s;erving this difference, that the means for conver&s;ion were <HI>confined within</HI> the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> church, which are now <HI>freely u&s;ed</HI> with others who are <HI>without</HI> the chri&s;ti|an church, can convey <HI>no other</HI> meaning in it, than that there are <HI>no means</HI> u&s;ed for conver&s;ion within this church; then I de&s;pair of ever conveying any ju&s;t ideas to mankind I However, when we &s;ee how this man leaves his own mean|ing, we &s;hall not wonder at this treatment of others; for upon my &s;aying that <HI>Paul</HI> takes much pains to keep <HI>Abra|ham's</HI> natural and &s;piritual &s;eed di&s;tinct, he &s;ays,
<Q><HI>Abra|ham</HI> never had a &s;piritual &s;eed, nor no other man, the man Je&s;us Chri&s;t excepted.</Q>
p. 24. And leaves it &s;o. Now whether he thinks, <HI>One&s;imus</HI> whom <HI>Paul</HI> had <HI>begotten in his bonds,</HI> was his <HI>natural</HI> or <HI>&s;piritual &s;on</HI> I know not; neither &s;hall I detain my reader, any further than to cor|rect two &s;tories which this writer has publi&s;hed.</P>
<P>In warning the people of <HI>Wood&s;tock</HI> of their danger, Mr. <HI>Fo&s;ter</HI> &s;ays,
<Q>By going after tho&s;e who are now cau&s;ing divi&s;ions and &s;eparations among you, and conniving at their wicked doctrines and practices, you will be in dan|ger of falling into &s;uch errors, and embracing &s;uch opi|nions, as will render your &s;alvation altogether hopele&s;s.</Q>
p. 28. Then after allowing that there were &s;ome &s;ober bapti&s;ts in the land 20 years ago, he &s;ays,
<Q>As to our pre|&s;ent &s;eparate bapti&s;ts, 'tis well known that in opinion and practice, they are notoriou&s;ly bad, and &s;eem daily grow|ing wor&s;e. Witne&s;s Dr. <HI>Davis's</HI> book, which &s;o far as I can under&s;tand, is generally liked among them. This man was as famous a bapti&s;t preacher as any in the country a few years ago, and what he is now come to, his book will &s;how, in which he bla&s;phemou&s;ly attributes all conviction of &s;in to the Devil.</Q>
p. 29.</P>
<P>This I perceive was delivered from the pulpit, which makes me think of Dr. <HI>Franck's</HI> &s;aying, that he who hears
<PB N="128" REF="010823_0065_0F81D40A63991150">
&s;uch a railer does not hear Chri&s;t, but the devil him&s;elf; for what could that <HI>accu&s;er</HI> &s;ay more fal&s;e than this is! The pa&s;tor of the bapti&s;t church in <HI>Stafford,</HI> informed me &s;ome years ago of one <HI>Davis</HI> a phy&s;ician, who was ca&s;t out of that church, for broaching antinomian errors; and that he publi&s;hed a &s;mall pamphlet upon them afterward: but I never &s;aw the man nor his book, and 'tis &s;o far from be|ing "generally liked among" our churches, that very few have ever &s;een his book, and Mr. <HI>Fo&s;ter</HI> may be boldly challenged to produce an in&s;tance if he can of one member in the bapti&s;t church in <HI>Wood&s;tock,</HI> or any church which they hold-fellow&s;hip with, who like or will countenance the horrid principle he &s;peaks of.</P>
<P>The other &s;tory concerns <HI>Wook&s;tock</HI> in particular. Mr. <HI>Fo&s;ter</HI> &s;ays,
<Q>I am informed that not long &s;ince, there was a hopeful pro&s;pect of the revival of &s;erious godline&s;s among you; that a number of per&s;ons in this place, ap|peared &s;eriou&s;ly and &s;uitably concerned about the great things of God and religion, and were enquiring the way to Zion, with their faces thither ward; but no &s;ooner did the&s;e men, like a de&s;troying flood, come in among you, but they flung all into confu&s;ion, as you &s;ee this day, and in a moment da&s;hed all your hopes of a revival of god|line&s;s among&s;t you.</Q>
p. 33.34.</P>
<P>Now the plain &s;tate of their ca&s;e, as I have it from good authorities, is briefly thus. Vanity and extravagance, e&s;|pecially among young people in that place, had greatly prevailed: 'till a young man, who had been a ringleader in frolicking, happened to hear a <HI>bapti&s;t</HI> elder preach, in Dec. 1763. which was ble&s;t as a means of his <HI>awakening,</HI> and he continued under <HI>conviction</HI> 'till the next <HI>March,</HI> and then was brought out of darkne&s;s into marvellous light; where|upon four of his old companions came one evening, to try to get him back to his former way; but in&s;tead of that, two of them were &s;eized under <HI>conviction</HI>; and they were moved to &s;et up religious meetings, in&s;tead of their former frolicks; which meetings in a few weeks increa&s;ed to &s;eve|ral hundreds; and the&s;e meetings which were carried on by prayer, &s;inging, reading, and mutual exhortation, were made a happy means of the awakening and hopeful con|ver&s;ion of a con&s;iderable number. And tho' they gladly improved occa&s;ional opportunities of hearing bapti&s;t elders, yet they &s;till attended the pari&s;h meeting, 'till the mini&s;ter there, upon a fa&s;t which was appointed for the purpo&s;e, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ot &s;ome neighbouring mini&s;ters to labour to regulate
<PB N="129" REF="010823_0065_0F81D40A63991150">
them: who plainly warned them again&s;t the fir&s;t in&s;tru|ments of their awakening, as being the <HI>deceivers</HI> which &s;hould come in the la&s;t times. And they evidently &s;et up the &s;ame &s;tandard that we have &s;een &s;o much of before, of <HI>mea&s;uring them&s;elves by them&s;elves,</HI> &s;o as to read all off for <HI>delu&s;ion,</HI> which interfered with the order and honor of the old mini&s;ters and churches as they &s;tood.</P>
<P>But for young converts to hear, the in&s;truments and na|ture of that work, which turn'd them from vanity to love Chri&s;t, treated at &s;uch a rate, it only &s;erved to convince them that the mini&s;ters who treated things at that rate, were wrong, and &s;o finally cau&s;ed a &s;eparation from them, and a bapti&s;t church was gathered in that place. The former part of this account I had from the mouth of the young man who as fir&s;t awakened there, and in the pre|&s;ence of one of the two young men who were convinced by him; and the re&s;t I have had atte&s;ted by many &s;ub|&s;tantial evidences.</P>
<P>I leave the reader to make his own remarks; and &s;hall only ob&s;erve that this author has intermixed with the&s;e &s;landers, &s;ome quotations of the mo&s;t <HI>bitter</HI> &s;entences again&s;t the bapti&s;ts, that he could find in the antient fa|thers; it makes me think of a &s;aying of one of the <HI>old Martyrs,</HI>
<Q>Alas! &s;ays he, &s;uch is the wickedne&s;s of the&s;e our la&s;t days, that nothing moves us!&mdash;Neither the pure doctrine, the godline&s;s of life, nor good example of the antient fathers.&mdash;If in anything they erred, that will their charitable children embrace, <HI>publi&s;h</HI> and main|tain with &s;word, faggot and fire: but in vain they &s;trive again&s;t the &s;tream; for tho' in de&s;pite of the truth, by force of the ears of crafty per&s;ua&s;ion, they may bring them&s;elves into the haven of <HI>hell</HI>; yet can they not make all men believe that the banks move, while the &s;hip &s;aileth, nor ever &s;hall be able to turn the direct cour&s;e of the &s;tream of God's truth.</Q></P>
