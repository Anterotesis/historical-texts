<HEAD>PREFACE Of the Author.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t thirty years of my life were &s;pent in the <HI>literary way,</HI> and generally employed in a cour&s;e of hard &s;tudy, and clo&s;e attention to &s;ome &s;ubject or other; after which, by a turn in my private affairs, I went into a cour&s;e of <HI>mercantile bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI> which was indeed more a matter of nece&s;&s;ity than inclination. My old habits of reading and thinking could not ea&s;ily be &s;haken off, and I was &s;carce ever without either a book or &s;ome &s;ubject of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion ready prepared, to which I could re&s;ort, the mo|ment I found my&s;elf at lei&s;ure from other bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>My u&s;ual method of di&s;cu&s;&s;ing any &s;ubjects which I un|dertook to examine, was, as far as po&s;&s;ible, to find out and define the <HI>original, natural principles</HI> of them, and to &s;uffer my mind to be drawn on without <HI>bias or any incidental pre|judice,</HI> to &s;uch conclu&s;ions as tho&s;e original principles would naturally <HI>lead to</HI> and <HI>demon&s;trate, i. e.</HI> I endeavoured, as far as I could, to make my&s;elf <HI>my own original,</HI> and draw all my knowledge from the <HI>original and natural &s;ources</HI> or <HI>fir&s;t principles</HI> of it.</P>
<P>The powerful pre&s;&s;ures of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> force during the war, and the ob&s;tinate and determined defence of the <HI>Ame|ricans,</HI> &s;oon threw every thing into di&s;order, and produced every day <HI>new occurrences</HI> and <HI>new problems,</HI> which <HI>Ame|rica</HI> had never &s;een before, and, of cour&s;e, knew not how either to obviate or &s;olve them.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t operations of the war affected my connexions in trade &s;o much, that it threw me out of my u&s;ual cour&s;e of bu&s;ine&s;s, and left me at lei&s;ure to contemplate <HI>tho&s;e occur|rences;</HI> and I thought I might render an e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice to my country by examining them, reducing them to <HI>their original principles,</HI> explaining their <HI>nature,</HI> and pointing out their <HI>natural operation and probable effects.</HI></P>
<P>I conceived that the mo&s;t important and alarming of the&s;e events and que&s;tions were tho&s;e which re&s;pected <HI>our re&s;ources,</HI> and e&s;pecially the <HI>&s;tate of the Continental money,</HI> which was the <HI>&s;ole &s;upply</HI> of the public trea&s;ury at that
<PB N="iv" REF="023972_0003_0FC2BB9F91078EE0">
time. This induced me to turn my attention very &s;eriou&s;ly to the <HI>nature and operation of MONEY and finance;</HI> a &s;ubject which I had never before examined, further than daily practice and private economy made nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Some <HI>rea&s;onings and conclu&s;ions</HI> on this &s;ubject were pub|li&s;hed under the &s;ignature of <HI>A Financier</HI> in 1776, and make the fir&s;t of the following E&s;&s;ays; all the re&s;t were publi&s;hed &s;ucce&s;&s;ively (as dated) under the &s;ignature of <HI>A Citizen of Philadelphia.</HI></P>
<P>Whil&s;t I rea&s;oned on the great &s;ubjects of the <HI>natural operation of money</HI> and of <HI>national finances,</HI> and drew &s;uch theorems and conclu&s;ions as appeared to me to re&s;ult from their natural, original <HI>principles,</HI> I had an opportunity to compare tho&s;e <HI>conclu&s;ions</HI> with real <HI>fact,</HI> and to judge of their truth by <HI>experiment of their actual effects;</HI> and in this I was rarely mi&s;taken. The effects or con&s;equences which I inferred from the principles on which I rea&s;oned, &s;carce|ly in one in&s;tance <HI>failed to follow</HI> in the <HI>kind,</HI> tho' not al|ways in the <HI>degree,</HI> which I expected, <HI>e. g.</HI> the &s;trength of the States, and the patrioti&s;m, the patience, the firmne&s;s, and &s;teady virtue of our people, were <HI>greater</HI> than I could expect, whil&s;t I rea&s;oned on human nature and human pa&s;&s;ions, as exhibited in the example of other nations, <HI>e&s;pecially in the in&s;tance of unpaid armies.</HI> From the&s;e &s;prang re&s;ources for continuing the war, beyond my &s;anguine cal|culations, whil&s;t <HI>national ruin</HI> appeared to me more near and certain than it really was.</P>
<P>Again, the ob&s;tinate per&s;everance of the <HI>Briti&s;h nation</HI> in continuing the <HI>American</HI> war was <HI>le&s;s</HI> than I computed on. I believe, the <HI>American independence</HI> was the only point which that nation ever yielded, after exerting every nerve of their &s;trength to carry their purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Further, I had no idea that the <HI>Continental money</HI> could be made to pa&s;s at all <HI>as a medium of trade</HI> at a depreciation even of 50 or 100, much le&s;s of 500, for 1.</P>
<P>It may be worth notice here, that the&s;e E&s;&s;ays exhibit not only a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the <HI>principles and nature of money</HI> and <HI>national finances,</HI> but contain al&s;o a kind of <HI>hi&s;tory</HI> of the&s;e principles <HI>compared</HI> with <HI>facts</HI> or their <HI>real operation,</HI> during the convul&s;ions of <HI>America</HI> thro' a &s;even years' war, when the dangers, the di&s;tre&s;&s;es, the firmne&s;s, the terrors, the wi&s;dom, the folly, the expedients, the exertions, the re&s;ources, the &s;trength and the weakne&s;s, the &s;ucce&s;&s;es and the di&s;appointments, which appeared under all modes and forms, put every <HI>principle</HI> into <HI>operation,</HI> and every <HI>conclu|&s;ion</HI>
<PB N="v" REF="023972_0004_0FC2BBA103B37E98">
and <HI>theorem to the te&s;t,</HI> and left no room for <HI>fal&s;e rea|&s;onings</HI> or <HI>idle projections,</HI> becau&s;e their <HI>fallacy</HI> was &s;ure to be <HI>detected very &s;oon</HI> by a <HI>failure</HI> or <HI>deficiency</HI> of their <HI>effects.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e E&s;&s;ays were all written at the times in which the &s;everal &s;ubjects of them were <HI>fre&s;h,</HI> and <HI>&s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed</HI> on every <HI>American</HI> mind, and the <HI>feelings</HI> of every body were <HI>alive</HI> and <HI>wound up</HI> to the highe&s;t pitch of anxiety, and an a&s;ylum of even &s;afety was eagerly &s;ought. It may, therefore, be agreeable to my <HI>fellow-citizens</HI> to <HI>revi&s;e the&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;cenes,</HI> as people &s;ometimes have plea&s;ure in view|ing <HI>places</HI> in which they have pa&s;&s;ed thro' <HI>&s;orrows</HI> and <HI>cala|mities</HI> that are now over and pa&s;t.</P>
<P>A review of arguments and rea&s;onings on the ab&s;tru&s;e &s;ubject of money and finance, <HI>cennected with fact, i. e.</HI> with the <HI>actual effects and con&s;equences</HI> of them, may afford &s;ome <HI>gratification</HI> and <HI>amu&s;ement</HI> to <HI>&s;peculative</HI> people, who are di&s;po&s;ed to examine and explore tho&s;e <HI>difficult,</HI> but very <HI>intere&s;ting matters,</HI> errors and mi&s;takes in which have tript up the heels of, and brought by the board, very many &s;tate&s;men in every nation.</P>
<P>For this rea&s;on it is probable that <HI>politicians</HI> and <HI>&s;tate&s;men</HI> who may happen to be involved in the&s;e inquiries, may find <HI>benefit</HI> in an attention to <HI>American experience.</HI></P>
<P>Such a connexion of <HI>principles, theorems,</HI> and <HI>facts,</HI> in the great &s;ubject of <HI>money</HI> and <HI>finance,</HI> is a <HI>phenomenon</HI> rare|ly to be found in any nation &s;o clearly exhibited, as in the hi&s;tory of money and finances in our States during the war and its con&s;equences.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, in the hi&s;tory of <HI>American</HI> di&s;tre&s;&s;es, <HI>perfect wi&s;dom</HI> is not to be expected; but we have an opportunity of <HI>learning wi&s;dom</HI> from it. Many <HI>projects, plans, &s;chemes,</HI> and <HI>manoeuvres,</HI> &s;ome of them <HI>hurtful,</HI> and others <HI>vain</HI> and <HI>ridiculous</HI> enough, were &s;et on foot, and &s;ome of them pu&s;hed into execution with great &s;everity, which either <HI>died &s;oon</HI> without effect, or were <HI>marked with calamity</HI> du|ring their continuance.</P>
<P>Many others more <HI>wi&s;e</HI> and <HI>judicious</HI> were al&s;o propo&s;ed, and <HI>&s;ooner or later</HI> adopted with <HI>&s;ucce&s;s and great benefit.</HI></P>
<P>We have now an opportunity of <HI>di&s;tingui&s;hing</HI> the <HI>wi&s;e</HI> from the <HI>fooli&s;h,</HI> the <HI>good</HI> from the <HI>bad,</HI> by their effects, which may help us much to wi&s;dom in our future coun&s;els.</P>
<P>We are now <HI>at lei&s;ure for con&s;ideration,</HI> and cannot plead <HI>pre&s;&s;ures</HI> and <HI>di&s;tre&s;&s;es</HI> in excu&s;e for any mi&s;takes; and we have the effects of former errors, like beacons of caution &s;et up before our eyes to guard us again&s;t repeating them.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="023972_0005_0FC2BBAF4D167E90">
Some E&s;&s;ays on different &s;ubjects are introduced here, which I leave; with all the re&s;t, to make their way in the world, <HI>according to their merits.</HI></P>
<P>In the&s;e E&s;&s;ays Continental money is often con&s;idered; to under&s;tand the arguments it may often be nece&s;&s;ary to recur to the value of that money at the date of each E&s;&s;ay: I have, for this purpo&s;e, added at the end of this book four <HI>&s;cales of depreciation,</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the &s;cale of <HI>Congre&s;s,</HI> that of the State of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hed by law, <HI>April</HI> 3, 1781, and two others, one for <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> the other for <HI>Virginia,</HI> taken from the <HI>merchants' books.</HI></P>
<P>The two fir&s;t, for political rea&s;ons, vary from the <HI>true exchange</HI> part of the time; the other two, taken from the merchants' books, are as <HI>near the true and actual exchange,</HI> as a thing of &s;uch a fluctuating and variable nature can be expected to be.</P>
<P>I have al&s;o added a chronology of remarkable events, as people generally connect the occurrences of the&s;e times with &s;ome or other of tho&s;e events.</P>
<P>I cannot &s;ay I had all the &s;ucce&s;s in the&s;e publications which I wi&s;hed.</P>
<P>In &s;ome ca&s;es, they cro&s;&s;ed the favorite <HI>plans</HI> propo&s;ed by influential men, which, like their children, they could not bear to &s;ee <HI>killed,</HI> or even <HI>corrected.</HI></P>
<P>In &s;ome ca&s;es they oppo&s;ed &s;ome great and &s;trong <HI>inter|e&s;ts,</HI> which bore them down.</P>
<P>In &s;ome ca&s;es, they &s;tood oppo&s;ed to <HI>general opinion</HI> in point of real propriety. The &s;ubjects were new, and the public mind had not time to fix it&s;elf on the ground of <HI>experience;</HI> many errors prevailed at that time.</P>
<P>In fine, mo&s;t people at the time were wrought up to &s;uch a <HI>pa&s;&s;ionate attachment</HI> to the <HI>American cau&s;e,</HI> that they had not patience to examine and con&s;ider <HI>coolly</HI> the <HI>means nece&s;&s;ary</HI> to &s;upport it.</P>
<P>But all men have now an opportunity to compare the various <HI>plans and projects</HI> of tho&s;e times with the <HI>facts</HI> which followed, and doubtle&s;s will have plea&s;ure in di&s;tin|gui&s;hing the <HI>wi&s;e and prudent</HI> from the <HI>wild and idle,</HI> by their <HI>actual effects.</HI></P>
<P>In this view, I here pre&s;ent my E&s;&s;ays all together to the reader's peru&s;al and cen&s;ure.</P>

<HEAD>AN ESSAY On the Danger of too much circulating Ca&s;h in a State, the ill Con&s;equences thence ari&s;ing, and the Nece&s;&s;ary Remedies.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">[Publi&s;hed in the Penn&s;ylvania Evening Po&s;t of Oct. 5, 1776, un|der the &s;ignature of A Financier.]</HEAD>
<P>THE computations of the value of the Free States of America by <HI>Conti</HI>&mdash;and <HI>Doria,</HI> in the Evening Po&s;t of Sept. 21, rather prove that value to be immen&s;e than reduce it to a certainty. Perhaps another method of com|putation might be admitted, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> from the quantity of land within the pre&s;ent inhabited part of tho&s;e &s;tates, which is at lea&s;t two hundred millions of acres, and worth a dollar per acre I &s;hould think at lea&s;t, &s;ome &s;ay two or three dol|lars, and perhaps the per&s;onal e&s;tate may be computed at as much more, which I do not think is reckoning high, and will make the amount four hundred millions of dol|lars. All the&s;e computations prove with certainty enough that the funds, on which the Continental money depends, are &s;ufficiently great to &s;upport a very much larger quan|tity than is already emitted.<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">The fir&s;t emi&s;&s;ion of Continental money was dated May 10, 1775, but was not really i&s;&s;ued into actual circulation till &s;ome months afterwards, but the quantity multiplied &s;o fa&s;t that it became &s;omewhat alarming at the time when this e&s;&s;ay was written.</NOTE> I would farther ob&s;erve that the American States owe nothing to any body but them&s;elves, and employ no &s;hips, &s;oldiers, &amp;c. but their own, &s;o that they contract no foreign debt; and I take it
<PB N="2" REF="023972_0009_0FC2BBBD7418CEA8">
to be a clear maxim, that no &s;tate can be ruined, bankrupt|ed, or indeed much endangered, by any debt due to it&s;elf only; nor can it ever be much impoveri&s;hed by any war, if the war and other ca&s;ualties do not de&s;troy mankind fa&s;ter than the women produce them, and the people that are left at home can furni&s;h the provi&s;ions, clothing, &amp;c. ne|ce&s;&s;ary for them&s;elves and the &s;oldiery, together with all other nece&s;&s;ary &s;tores and implements of the war.</P>
<P>There requires no more to pre&s;erve &s;uch a &s;tate in a war of any length of time than good economy in bringing the burden equally on all, in proportion to their abilities; but then I think it very nece&s;&s;ary that they &s;hould <HI>pay as they go,</HI> as near as may be. The <HI>&s;oldier</HI> renders his per|&s;onal &s;ervices down on the &s;pot, the <HI>farmer</HI> his provi&s;ions, the <HI>trade&s;man</HI> his fabrics, and why &s;hould not the <HI>monied man</HI> pay his money down too? Why &s;hould the &s;oldier, trade&s;man, farmer, &amp;c. be paid in promi&s;es, which are not &s;o good as money, if the fulfilment is at a di&s;tance?</P>
<P>Payment in promi&s;es or bills of credit is a temporary expedient, and will always be dangerous, where the quan|tity increa&s;es too much, at lea&s;t it will always have the con&s;equences of a medium increa&s;ed beyond the nece&s;&s;ities of trade; and whenever that happens, a &s;peedy remedy is nece&s;&s;ary, or the ill effects will &s;oon be alarming, and, if long neglected, will not be ea&s;ily remedied. The remedy or rather prevention of this evil I take to be very ea&s;y at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>If the <HI>quantity of Continental currency is greater than is nece&s;&s;ary for a medium of trade,</HI> it will appear by a number of very perceptible effects, each of which point out and facilitate the remedy. <HI>One effect</HI> will be, that people will choo&s;e to have their e&s;tates ve&s;ted in any goods of intrin&s;ic value rather than in money, and of cour&s;e there will be a quick demand for every kind of goods, and con&s;equently a high price for them; <HI>another effect</HI> will be di&s;couragement of indu&s;try, for people will not work hard to procure goods for &s;ale, while the medium for which they mu&s;t &s;ell them is &s;uppo&s;ed to be wor&s;e than the goods; and of cour&s;e, <HI>an|other effect</HI> will be a di&s;couragement of trade, for nobody
<PB N="3" REF="023972_0010_0FC2BBC6B85A77C8">
will import goods, and &s;ell them, when imported, for a medium that is wor&s;e than the goods them&s;elves; for in that ca&s;e, though the profits may be <HI>nominal,</HI> the lo&s;s will be <HI>real.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e effects all point out their only remedy, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> le&s;|&s;ening the quantity of the circulating medium, and this can be done by but three ways that I know of: Fir&s;t, the <HI>de&s;truction of it</HI> by &s;ome ca&s;ualty, as fire, &s;hipwreck, &amp;c. or &s;econdly, <HI>exportation</HI> of it, which cannot happen in our ca&s;e, becau&s;e our medium has no currency abroad, and I think it very well for us that it has not; for in that ca&s;e our debt would &s;oon become due to people without our&s;elves, and of cour&s;e le&s;s &s;en&s;ible, more difficult to be paid, and more dangerous; the third, and, in my opinion, the only practicable way of le&s;&s;ening the quantity is <HI>by a tan,</HI> which never can be paid &s;o ea&s;y as when money is more plenty, than goods, and of cour&s;e, the very cau&s;e which makes a tax nece&s;&s;ary, facilitates the payment of it.</P>
<P>The tax ought to be <HI>equal to the exce&s;s of the currency,</HI> &s;o as to le&s;&s;en the currency down to that quantity which is nece&s;&s;ary for a medium of trade, and this, in my opinion, ought to be done by every &s;tate, whether money is imme|diately wanted in the public trea&s;ury or not, for it is better for any &s;tate to have their exce&s;s of money, tho' it were all gold and &s;ilver, <HI>hoarded</HI> in a public trea&s;ury or bank, than <HI>circulated</HI> among the people, for nothing can have wor&s;e effects on any &s;tate than an exce&s;s of money. The pover|ty of the &s;tates of Holland, where nobody can have mo|ney who does not fir&s;t earn it, has produced indu&s;try, fru|gality, economy, good habits of body and mind, and du|rable and well-e&s;tabli&s;hed riches, whil&s;t the exce&s;s of mo|ney has produced the contrary in Spain, i. e. has ruined their indu&s;try and economy, and filled them with pride and poverty.</P>
<P>But there is, be&s;ides this general principle, a &s;pecial rea&s;on in our ca&s;e, why we &s;hould pay a large part of our Continental debt by a pre&s;ent tax; the great con&s;umption of our armies, and &s;toppage of our imports, make a great demand for the produce of our lands, the fabrics of our

trade&s;men, and the labor of our people, and of cour&s;e rai&s;es the prices of all the&s;e much higher than u&s;ual, &s;o that the hu&s;bandman, trade&s;man, and laborer get money much fa&s;ter and ea&s;ier than they u&s;ed to do, and it is a plain maxim, that people &s;hould always pay their debts when they have a good run of bu&s;ine&s;s, and have money plenty; many a man has been <HI>di&s;tre&s;&s;ed</HI> for a debt when bu|&s;ine&s;s and money were &s;carce, which he had <HI>neglected</HI> to pay when he could have done it with great ea&s;e to him&s;elf, had he attended to it in its proper &s;ea&s;on; this applies to a community or &s;tate as well as to a private per&s;on.</P>
<P>The&s;e la&s;t ob&s;ervations will apply with great exactne&s;s to tho&s;e parts of the Continent which lie neare&s;t to the great &s;cenes of the war, and have &s;uffered mo&s;t by it; and if they can bear the tax, I think tho&s;e who lie at a di&s;tance from tho&s;e horrors, and have felt little more than a &s;ympa|thy of the di&s;tre&s;s of their brethren, can have no rea&s;on to complain, if they are called on for their &s;hare of the expen&s;e.</P>
<P>The Continental money is to be con&s;idered as a debt fa&s;tened on the per&s;on and e&s;tate of every member of the United States, a debt of great honor and ju&s;tice, of na|tional honor and ju&s;tice, not barely <HI>empty honor,</HI> but that <HI>e&s;&s;ential honor and credit</HI> in which the &s;afety of the &s;tate is compri&s;ed, and therefore by confe&s;&s;ion of every body mu&s;t be punctually and honorably paid in due time; otherwi&s;e all &s;ecurity ari&s;ing from public credit mu&s;t be lo&s;t, all con|fidence of individuals in our public councils mu&s;t be de|&s;troyed, and great inju&s;tice mu&s;t be done to every po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of our public currency, to the <HI>detriment</HI> of all, and ruin of many who have placed mo&s;t confidence in our public ad|mini&s;tration: and nothing but &s;hame, &s;candal, and con|tempt can en&s;ue, for which nothing but mo&s;t inevitable ne|ce&s;&s;ity can be any rea&s;onable excu&s;e.<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">The citizen, at the time of writing this, had no conception that the continental money could continue to be a quick currency at 500 for 1, and finally run it&s;elf out to nothing, and die, not only without <HI>any tumult, but</HI> with the general <HI>&s;atisfaction</HI> of the people.</NOTE></P>
<P>And in this great argument is every individual of our United States &s;o deeply intere&s;ted, that I cannot conceive
<PB N="5" REF="023972_0012_0FC2BBD1C4969750">
one &s;en&s;ible per&s;on can be per&s;uaded to ri&s;k the&s;e con&s;e|quences for the &s;ake of a little delay of payment of that which mu&s;t one day be paid, or we mu&s;t all be ruined to|gether. The Continental debt is already a heavy one, and there is no way of &s;inking it but by paying it while we can; it is &s;till increa&s;ing fa&s;t; and without a &s;peedy tax, and a very &s;ufficient one, it will grow upon us beyond any po&s;&s;ibility of payment. If a man only &s;uffers his rents, butcher's and trade&s;man's bills, &amp;c. to be unpaid a number of years, it will endanger his whole fortune. An expen&s;e account ought always to be paid up as &s;oon as it becomes due; the&s;e are accumulating &s;ums, and it is dangerous to neglect them.</P>
<P>I have heard &s;ome people &s;ay, it is no matter for the pre&s;ent payment of the Continental debt, we are a country of rapid increa&s;e, and what is contracted by three millions of people, will &s;oon be paid by &s;ix. But how unfatherly and ungenerous is it to load po&s;terity with an immen&s;e debt, which we have an advantage in &s;inking a good part of our&s;elves; be&s;ides, it will be a great di&s;couragement to foreign emigrants to &s;ettle in this country, to be told that the country is loaded with an immen&s;e debt, and their fir&s;t title to an enfranchi&s;ement will be by beginning to pay it.</P>
<P>We are engaged in a cau&s;e which, in all annals of time, has ever been deemed mo&s;t honorable and glorious, and mo&s;t characteri&s;tic of noble and generous minds, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> &s;purn|ing off &s;lavery, and a&s;&s;erting our liberty. As things now &s;tand, the mo&s;t hardened, impudent Tory does not pretend that if we fail of &s;upporting our cau&s;e, we have any other chance but that of ab&s;olute &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and pardon, and even that pardon, doubtle&s;s, with numerous exceptions. Good GOD! Who can bear the thought of ab&s;olute <HI>&s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion and pardon? Pardon!</HI> for the greate&s;t virtue of a civil nature that the human mind is capable of! Who can think, without di&s;traction, of coming under the domina|tion of tories, and &s;uing to them for favors and interce&s;|&s;ions? Tories! with &s;tanding armies at their heels, and &s;oldiers with bayonets ready to enforce all the re&s;pect and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion they may claim.</P>

This dreadful apprehe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ion introduces, with great force on my mind, another rea&s;on why we ought to &s;ink, by a &s;ufficient tax, as much as we can of the continental debt, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> That without this it is not po&s;&s;ible to continue the war, and avoid ab&s;olute &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I conceive the <HI>value of the currency</HI> of any &s;tate has <HI>a limit,</HI> a <HI>ne plus ultra,</HI> beyond which it cannot go, and if the <HI>nominal &s;um</HI> is extended beyond that <HI>limit,</HI> the <HI>value</HI> will not follow. No human wi&s;dom, or authority, can be able to &s;tretch the nominal currency beyond &s;uch real va|lue. The con&s;equence of any attempt to extend &s;uch no|minal addition, mu&s;t depreciate the value of the whole, till it is reduced within &s;aid limit.</P>
<P>I will explain my meaning thus:<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">No e&s;timate of the current ca&s;h of the Thirteen States had been made on any &s;ure data when this e&s;&s;ay was publi&s;hed, but it was generally computed at about 30,000,000 of dollars, which is &s;omewhat le&s;s than one third of the current ca&s;h of Great Britain; but on a more critical examina|tion of the &s;ubject, this computation appeared much too high: perhaps, about 12,000,000 of dollars may be near the truth.</NOTE> Suppo&s;e that thirty millions of dollars was the utmo&s;t limit of currency to which the United States of America could give real, ef|fectual value, and they &s;hould emit thirty millions more; I &s;ay the la&s;t thirty millions would add nothing to the value of the whole, but would &s;ink the value of the whole &s;ixty millions down to its limit, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> thirty millions; i. e. the whole &s;ixty millions in that ca&s;e would not purcha&s;e more real, &s;ub&s;tantial goods, than the thirty millions would have done, before the other thirty millions were added to it.</P>
<P>It follows from this, that any attempt to continue the war, by increa&s;ing the currency beyond the above&s;aid limit, is vain, and mu&s;t fail of the effect intended, and ruin all tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s the currency already emitted. Whether the currency already emitted ri&s;es to the &s;aid limit, is a que&s;tion of fact that may admit &s;ome doubt, but that it is not greatly within it, I think can be no doubt with people well acquainted with the nature and circum&s;tances of this great &s;ubject; and be that as it may, I think every incon|venience ari&s;ing from it is ea&s;ily remedied by a &s;ufficient tax. I do not apprehend we have yet &s;uffered by a depre|ciation
<PB N="7" REF="023972_0014_0FC2BBE7C903D0C8">
of the currency, becau&s;e I cannot ob&s;erve that the general prices of goods are more rai&s;ed than the circum|&s;tances of the war would make nece&s;&s;ary, were our money all gold and &s;ilver, and farther extremities may produce farther effects of the &s;ame kind, without depreciating the currency at all.</P>
<P>No kind of nece&s;&s;aries have ri&s;en to the exce&s;s of price given la&s;t winter in Bo&s;ton for fre&s;h provi&s;ions, tho' their currency was all gold and &s;ilver, increa&s;e of ri&s;k mu&s;t rai&s;e the price of all imported goods, &s;carcity of laborers mu&s;t rai&s;e the price of labor, and of con&s;equence the price of every thing produced by labor, &s;carcity of trade&s;men (ma|ny of whom are gone into the war) and demand for trade&s;|men's fabrics, mu&s;t rai&s;e the price of them; be&s;ides, many raw materials u&s;ed by the trade&s;men, mu&s;t be imported at great ri&s;k, and I do not &s;ee that the prices of mo&s;t or all the&s;e are greater than they would be, if every Continental dollar was a &s;ilver one.</P>
<P>But &s;hould we admit that we are on the verge of a de|preciation, or that our currency hath &s;uffered &s;ome little already in its value, two con&s;equences will follow, which de&s;erve great and immediate con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, That a <HI>&s;peedy remedy</HI> is immediately nece&s;&s;ary, which &s;hall operate effectually, and prevent the ruin of our currency; and the &s;econd is, that the remedy by this very means becomes more <HI>ea&s;y and practicable</HI> than otherwi&s;e it could be, becau&s;e a tax will be paid much more ea&s;ily in this ca&s;e than it could be, if money was in credit enough to be avariciou&s;ly hoarded, and this holds, let the tax be of any nature, &s;uch as general a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment of polls and e&s;|tates, exci&s;es, impo&s;ts, or duties on goods, lotteries, &amp;c. &amp;c. in any or all the&s;e ways, our currency may be le&s;&s;ened much ea&s;ier, when its credit is a little doubted, than when it is at its highe&s;t.<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">However plain the nece&s;&s;ity of a tax at that time to prevent the ex|ce&s;&s;ive increa&s;e of the continental money, may appear to us <HI>now,</HI> it was <HI>then</HI> not &s;o clear; for after many debates in Congre&s;s, that mea&s;ure was not adopted for a long time. I am told, one member of Congre&s;s ro&s;e during tho&s;e debates with this exclamation, <Q>Do you think, Gentlemen, that I will con&s;ent to load my con&s;tituents with taxes, when we can &s;end to our printer, and get a waggon-lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d of money, one quire of which will pay for the whole?</Q></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="023972_0015_0FC2BBE9B87BBF50">
What contributes not a little to this facility is, that it may be done by general con&s;ent, without public unea&s;ine&s;s and di&s;turbance, for a depreciation of currency can be wi&s;h|ed for by nobody, but tho&s;e who are deeply in debt, the weight or numbers of whom I have rea&s;on to believe is not great at pre&s;ent in the&s;e States; it is the mighty intere&s;t of all the re&s;t of the inhabitants to prevent a depreciation, and I conceive every man of e&s;tate who has ca&s;h in hand, or due to him, would be willing to contribute his &s;hare to the le&s;&s;ening our currency, and &s;o pre&s;erving its credit.

<HEAD>AN ESSAY ON FREE TRADE AND FINANCE.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Fir&s;t publi&s;hed in Philadelphia, July 1779, and dedicated to CONGRESS.</HEAD>
<P>FREEDOM of trade, or unre&s;trained liberty of the &s;ubject to <HI>hold or di&s;po&s;e of</HI> his property as he plea&s;es, is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the pro&s;perity of every community, and to the happine&s;s of all individuals who compo&s;e it: this liberty will produce the following effects:</P>
<P N="1">1. Every indu&s;trious man will procure <HI>all the goods</HI> he can for &s;ale; this is the way to get mo&s;t money; and gain is the &s;oul of indu&s;try, the hope of reward &s;weetens labor, and the mo&s;t righteous have re&s;pect to the recompence of reward.</P>
<P N="2">2. Every man will make his goods for market of the <HI>be&s;t quality</HI> he can, becau&s;e they will bring more money and quicker &s;ale than goods of mean quality.</P>
<P N="3">3. Every man will endeavour to carry to market the mo&s;t <HI>&s;carce goods</HI> becau&s;e there is the greate&s;t demand and be&s;t price for them. All experience &s;hews, that the mo&s;t effec|tual way to turn a &s;carcity into a plenty, is to rai&s;e the price of the articles wanted: witne&s;s, among other in|&s;tances, the mo&s;t alarming &s;carcity of &s;altpetre and gun|powder, in the beginning of the pre&s;ent war, &s;ucceeded by the mo&s;t abundant plenty in le&s;s than one year, effected altogether by the high price and premiums &s;et on them.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="10" REF="023972_0017_0FC2BBECD41E73A0">
4. Every man will go to market and return in <HI>good hu|mor</HI> and full &s;atisfaction, even though he may be di&s;ap|pointed of the high price he expected, becau&s;e he has had the full chance of the market, and can blame nobody; and &s;hould he indulge fretting on the occa&s;ion, he would be the more ridiculed, and le&s;s pitied by his neighbours: and good humor and &s;atisfaction contribute not a little to the happi|ne&s;s and pro&s;perity of communities, as well as individuals; and therefore this is an article by no means to be left out or overlooked in the admini&s;tration of either public or pri|vate oeconomy.</P>
<P N="5">5. In times of danger, di&s;tre&s;s, and difficulty, every man will u&s;e <HI>&s;trong endeavours</HI> to get his goods to market, in proportion to the nece&s;&s;ity and great demand for them; becau&s;e they will then bring the be&s;t price, and every man is fond of embracing golden opportunities and favorable chances.</P>
<P N="6">6. When things grow &s;carce and dear, every man will u&s;e them with the <HI>be&s;t oeconomy,</HI> and make the &s;tock on hand go as far and la&s;t as long as po&s;&s;ible; or if he is de&s;ti|tute, will buy as little as will ju&s;t &s;erve his nece&s;&s;ity.

<P N="7">7. In times of &s;carcity, every man will have &s;trong in|ducements to bring <HI>all he can &s;pare</HI> to market, becau&s;e it will then bring the highe&s;t price he can ever expect, and con&s;equently the community will have the benefit of all that exi&s;ts among them, in a much &s;urer manner than any degree of force could extort it, and all to the entire &s;atis|faction of buyer and &s;eller; by which the numberle&s;s feuds, riots, re&s;entments, and mi&s;chiefs which u&s;ually attend forced markets, would be entirely avoided; and the market be &s;upplied with all there is to be had.

<P N="8">8. In times of &s;carcity, when all the goods that are to be had, are expo&s;ed to &s;ale, it is not po&s;&s;ible the prices &s;hould <HI>exceed the degree of &s;carcity,</HI> for when the prices ri&s;e very high, they will &s;oon determine whether the &s;carcity is real or not; for <HI>if not real</HI> the high price will bring &s;uch quan|tity to market as will &s;oon lower the price; but <HI>if real,</HI> it is nece&s;&s;ary for the above rea&s;ons, that the prices &s;hould continue high till &s;upplies are produced.</P>

<P N="1">1. Every man will have as <HI>little to do</HI> with the market, and bring as few goods there as he can; for the le&s;s goods he has for &s;ale, the le&s;s mortification and lo&s;s he &s;u&s;tains.</P>
<P N="2">2. Every man will make his goods for market of a <HI>bad quality,</HI> or at lea&s;t not the be&s;t; for they mu&s;t all go at the limited price, and he therefore gets nothing for any &s;peci|al care or &s;kill he may be&s;tow on his goods to meliorate or perfect their quality: for the &s;ame rea&s;on, every man will expo&s;e his wor&s;t goods to market, and keep the be&s;t out of &s;ight; for example, mu&s;ty tea, &s;tale flour, black heavy bread, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="3">3. Every man is induced to keep &s;uch goods as are <HI>mo&s;t &s;carce</HI> from market; for if he carries them there, he can get no more than the limited price, and &s;tands a chance of a bad hu&s;tling in the crowd into the bargain. Whereas, if he can keep his goods from market, the &s;carcity will &s;oon force a great price, and he has a chance of great profits.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="12" REF="023972_0019_0FC2BBF8A6E93268">
4. If prices are limited, and the owner is compelled to &s;ell at the prices limited, he con&s;iders him&s;elf <HI>injured</HI> by every &s;ale he makes for le&s;s than he &s;uppo&s;es he could have obtained in a free market; that his liberty is taken from him, and he can no longer call his property his own. The&s;e are hard feelings to one born to freedom almo&s;t per|fect, and rai&s;ed to the expectations of enjoying it in future time, in its highe&s;t perfection. The&s;e feelings fill the mind with anxiety and re&s;entment, and when in&s;tances of this become numerous among the merchants, trade&s;men, and farmers, &s;mall accidents may blow up the concealed coal, and mo&s;t fatal effects may ea&s;ily be &s;uppo&s;ed to en&s;ue. This is a danger of no &s;mall magnitude, for the real &s;trength and e&s;tabli&s;hment of every government con&s;i&s;ts in the hearty union and &s;atisfaction of the individuals that compo&s;e it.</P>
<P N="5">5. In times of danger, di&s;tre&s;s, and difficulty, no man will be induced to any <HI>great efforts</HI> to &s;upply the market; for an additional danger makes an additional expen&s;e upon the goods; but he mu&s;t take the limited price and no more; he will not con&s;equently combat or ri&s;k an increa&s;e of dan|ger and expen&s;e without any chance of compen&s;ation.</P>
<P N="6">6. When things grow &s;carce, every man will endeavour to lay in <HI>great &s;tores</HI> if he can do it without an increa&s;e of price, and will not think it nece&s;&s;ary to retrench his ex|pen&s;es, whil&s;t he thinks his &s;tock will la&s;t through the &s;carcity; the con&s;equence of which is, that all the &s;carce articles at market will be &s;crambled up by a few hands, who will have no inducement to par&s;imony in the expendi|ture of them, by which the &s;carcity and di&s;tre&s;s are increa&s;|ed, and many mu&s;t be wholly de&s;titute; and as far as this re&s;pects the nece&s;&s;aries of life, the con&s;equences mu&s;t be dreadful.</P>
<P N="7">7. Add to the above, that in times of &s;carcity and great demand, every man who can po&s;&s;ibly <HI>conceal</HI> his goods will be tempted to do it, in expectation that the great de|mand will &s;oon break through the unnatural re&s;traint of the limitation, and he &s;hall be able to obtain a great profit in the future &s;ale; and in &s;pite of all the vigilance and force that can be u&s;ed, many will be able to do this; which I
<PB N="13" REF="023972_0020_0FC2BBFF5F655698">
take to be one of the natural effects of any unnatural re|&s;traint of trade, which cannot be avoided.</P>
<P N="8">8. In addition to all the&s;e, the <HI>difficulties</HI> which mu&s;t attend the execution of &s;uch an act of limitation, may per|haps furni&s;h not the lea&s;t objection to it. Mu&s;t the owner be obliged to &s;ell to every per&s;on who applies to purcha&s;e, without knowing whether he wants for u&s;e or &s;ale?

<P N="9">9. It is not po&s;&s;ible to form a limitation of prices which &s;hall <HI>be ju&s;t,</HI> and therefore the whole &s;cheme nece&s;&s;arily implies inju&s;tice. The principles on which the ju&s;t prices of goods are fixed, are in a con&s;tant &s;tate of fluctuation, and therefore the prices mu&s;t ri&s;e and fall with their cau&s;es; all experience proves this, and it holds true in the mo&s;t ex|ce&s;&s;ive degree, in times of &s;uch public di&s;tre&s;s and convul|&s;ion as we now experience. And as it is much &s;afer to bind a man in health than a man in convul&s;ions, &s;o it will be &s;afer to limit trade in peaceable than convul&s;ed times. It is not more ab&s;urd to limit the preci&s;e height to which a &s;hip &s;hall be fixed at a wharf, where the tide is con&s;tantly ebb|ing and flowing. A great force will be requi&s;ite to keep the &s;hip from ri&s;ing or falling with the tide, and a mighty little u&s;e to pay for the trouble; be&s;ides the probability of very e&s;&s;ential damage which the &s;hip mu&s;t incur by the ap|plication of the nece&s;&s;ary force: but indi&s;creet as this would be judged, it is le&s;s dangerous in a calm than in a &s;tormy &s;ea&s;on.</P>

10. Another mi&s;chievous con&s;equence of this fatal mea|&s;ure, and not the lea&s;t, I conceive to be its unhappy ten|dency to <HI>corrupt the morals and integrity</HI> of the people. To e&s;cape the ruinous con&s;equences of loo&s;ing in their &s;ales, they are in a manner compelled, but to &s;ay the lea&s;t, they have very &s;trong temptation, either by downright lying, or u&s;ing little arts, &s;hifts, and cheats, to avoid the &s;ale of their goods to di&s;advantage. <HI>This</HI> naturally brings them into the habit, and gives them a facility of inventing and practi&s;ing <HI>low methods</HI> of &s;hamming Abraham, which they never would otherwi&s;e have thought of, and which it is infinitely detrimental to the public, they ever &s;hould learn; in&s;tances of this &s;ort might be enumerated without end. But it is needle&s;s to give examples, it were better they and their cau&s;es &s;hould be removed, than that they &s;hould be re|peated. But after all, it is &s;aid that a limitation of prices is nece&s;&s;ary to <HI>appreciate the currency,</HI> and <HI>&s;upply the army.</HI> Two very great objects indeed: I will attend to both.</P>
<P>I. I do not conceive that a limitation of prices can po&s;&s;i|bly <HI>appreciate the currency</HI> or prevent a further depreciation.</P>
<P N="1">1. The value of money is nothing in it&s;elf, it is a <HI>mere relation,</HI> it is the proportion between the medium of trade and the objects of trade; the&s;e two will always be in ba|lance: Therefore, if the medium of trade be increa&s;ed, whil&s;t the objects of trade continue the &s;ame, the money mu&s;t depreciate; if the medium of trade increa&s;es, and the ob|jects of trade decrea&s;e, the proportion will alter fa&s;t, and the depreciation will increa&s;e in a double proportion, which I take to be the ca&s;e at pre&s;ent. Money will therefore in|crea&s;e or decrea&s;e its value according to the increa&s;e or de|crea&s;e of its quantity, and the increa&s;e or decrea&s;e of the quantity of goods, or the objects of trade. This principle is grounded on the nature of the thing, and can never be altered, and con&s;equently any attempt to oppo&s;e it mu&s;t be equally vain, as oppo&s;ing any other law of nature what|ever. It follows from this, that nothing can ever appreci|ate the money, but le&s;&s;ening its quantity, or increa&s;ing the quantity of goods or objects of trade, and all attempts to
<PB N="15" REF="023972_0022_0FC2BC0263C9D998">
do this in any other method, will prove vain and fruitle&s;s in the end.</P>
<P N="2">2. It follows, that the price that any article of trade will bring in a free, open market, is the only <HI>mea&s;ure of the value</HI> of that article at that time, and if this is warped from the truth, by any artifices of the merchant, or force of power, it cannot hold; but the error will &s;oon di&s;cover it|&s;elf, and the correction of it will be compelled by the irre|&s;i&s;tible force of natural principles, <HI>i. e.</HI> it is not po&s;&s;ible for merchants to rai&s;e goods too high, or the force of power to depre&s;s them too low, and make them keep &s;o. Both the&s;e may be done for a &s;hort time, but neither can la&s;t long.</P>
<P N="3">3. It follows that any limitation of prices, however &s;trongly enforced, if below the rates required by this great natural proportion, is but <HI>temporary inju&s;tice,</HI> cannot be of long continuance, will tend daily to le&s;&s;en the quantity of goods in market, and &s;o will increa&s;e the mi&s;chief it was de&s;igned to prevent, and bring with it a large train of evils be&s;ides, which will require much time and wi&s;dom to reme|dy, and many that will be utterly remedile&s;s, examples of which are obvious.</P>
<P N="4">4. Money is made only for a medium of trade, and mu&s;t be kept in <HI>circulation and u&s;e,</HI> or it peri&s;hes; for to &s;top the circulation of money and to kill it is the &s;ame thing, &s;top its cour&s;e and it dies, give it circulation again and it re|vives, or comes to life again; therefore, the price of goods for &s;ale, or objects of trade (<HI>i.e.</HI> every thing for which mo|ney is paid) mu&s;t always be &s;o high, as to require all the money there is to purcha&s;e them, otherwi&s;e the &s;um re|maining cannot circulate, <HI>i. e.</HI> there will be nothing to lay it out upon, and &s;o the owner mu&s;t keep it by him, dead and u&s;ele&s;s: &s;o that let what &s;ums of money &s;oever be in circulation, the objects of trade mu&s;t either increa&s;e in quantity, or ri&s;e in price &s;o high as to take all the money there is in circulation to purcha&s;e them, and as this natural law cannot be re&s;trained, &s;o neither can it be exceeded by any degree of artifice or force for any long time, for if the objects of trade ri&s;e &s;o high that all the money in circula|tion
<PB N="16" REF="023972_0023_0FC2BC0946BFF760">
will not purcha&s;e them, the overplus mu&s;t remain dead and un&s;aleable in the hands of the owner, which will &s;oon reduce the price; for goods which cannot be &s;old, are as u&s;ele&s;s in the hands of the merchant, as money which can|not be circulated.</P>
<P N="5">5. Every limitation of prices below their due proportion, <HI>checks the circulation</HI> of money, than which nothing can be more dangerous, when money is over plenty; this has been the con&s;tant effect of every limitation of prices which has been tried in America. Bu&s;ine&s;s immediately &s;tagnates, goods cannot be had, people cannot purcha&s;e with their money the nece&s;&s;aries they want, they begin of cour&s;e to think that their money is good for nothing, and refu&s;e to take any more of it, and grow willing to part with what they have on hand at a depreciated value; &s;o that the cer|tain operation of a limitation of prices is a further depre|ciation of the money in&s;tead of the contrary. In&s;tead of this, it is of the la&s;t nece&s;&s;ity in a plenty of money, that a free circulation be kept up, people will readily and even greedily take any money which they can readily pa&s;s again. And as long as this la&s;ts, there can be no danger of the money's &s;topping; whereas, the contrary chills it at once, and in a &s;hort time mu&s;t chill it into a torpor, incapable of cure. Much in this ca&s;e depends on opinion, which is &s;oon formed by people in general, when they find they cannot buy nece&s;&s;aries with their money. Specious rea|&s;onings, warm harrangues, declarations of Congre&s;s, or even the force of power operate little again&s;t this; it is a gl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ing intuitive proof of the badne&s;s of money, when it will not purcha&s;e nece&s;&s;aries, and as glaring and &s;trong a proof that it is good, when it will buy any thing in market. Hence appears the nece&s;&s;ity of keeping up a high and bri&s;k circulation of money, and the folly and danger of limita|tions, or any other mea&s;ures which prevent a circulation and ob&s;truct trade. The&s;e are arguments grounded on plain fact, they have their foundation in the laws of na|ture, and no artifice or force of man can prevent, elude, or avoid their effects; their operation is uncontrolable, and therefore I conceive all oppo&s;ition to them is the height of
<PB N="17" REF="023972_0024_0FC2BC0CDC1C2EA8">
ab&s;urdity, and dangerous in the highe&s;t degree.&mdash;For ten months before the late limitations, we had a trade perfect|ly free, on which two ob&s;ervations are obvious.</P>
<P N="1">1. That any goods at market might be bought for con|tinental money, the Speculators e&s;pecially (as they are call|ed) were fond of receiving it, and no per&s;on could be at any lo&s;s for any thing at market, if he had that money to purcha&s;e the goods he needed.</P>
<P N="2">2. That imported goods on an average (which were the only articles Speculators dealt in) were 50 per cent. cheaper on the 25th of May la&s;t, than on the 25th of July preced|ing, <HI>i. e.</HI> any given quantity of imported goods would buy 50 per cent. more articles of country produce, or hard mo|ney, on the 25th of July, than on the 25th of May la&s;t; and for the truth of this, I refer to the merchants' books; from which it follows that the Speculators (however nume|rous and however cen&s;ured) have not rai&s;ed the price of the goods they have principally dealt it:&mdash;Indeed all experience teaches, that the more hands the goods in market are held by, the cheaper they will be, and the more difficult to rai&s;e the price; and therefore, if the merchants ever think of rai&s;ing the price of any article, they never fail to &s;ay, We mu&s;t wait till the&s;e goods are drained out of the &s;mall &s;tores and get them into few hands. In July 25, 1778, price current of imported goods, at Philadelphia, was as follows, We&s;t-India rum 3l. 15s. Mu&s;covado &s;ugars 30l. mola&s;&s;es 40s. pepper 17s. 6d. coffee 9s. cotton 15s. bohea tea 60s. Madeira wine 400l. dry goods about 8 to 1 old prices, and hard money 4 to 1, and price current of country produce, was as follows, for Indian corn 15s. oats 12s. flour 60s. bar iron 200l. con&s;equently on July 25, 1778, one gallon of We&s;t-India rum would bring 5 bu&s;hels of Indian corn, 6 bu&s;hels of oats, 1&frac14; hundred of flour, and 2/5 of a <HI>hundred of iron,</HI> or 18s. 9d. hard money; any body may ea&s;ily compare the re&s;t, and they will find enough to prove my a&s;&s;ertion with large allowance. Price current 25th May la&s;t was, rum 7l. &s;ugars 130l. iron 800l. tea 6l. 10s. &amp;c. Indian corn 7l. 10s. oats 90s. flour 30l. (hard money 20 to 1) and con&s;equently one gallon of rum would buy no
<PB N="18" REF="023972_0025_0FC2BC10BAEB2CF8">
more than one bu&s;hel of Indian corn, 1&frac12; bu&s;hel of oats, &frac14; hundred flour, and 2/5 hundred iron or 7s. hard money, &amp;c. The&s;e computations are made in the face of the world, and grounded on facts which any body may di&s;|prove if they are not true, or correct the rea&s;oning if it is not ju&s;t. Now I have only to add; let any body who is di&s;po&s;ed to &s;ee, open their eyes, and &s;ee who it is that has rai&s;ed our prices, or <HI>which is the &s;ame thing,</HI> depreciated our money. Is it the Speculators who deal only in import|ed articles? Or the farmers, among whom no kind of dan|gerous &s;peculation does or can exi&s;t? Perhaps it may be re|plied here, that the articles of country produce are extreme|ly &s;carce, which rai&s;es their price beyond the due proporti|on of other things: if you &s;ay this, you &s;ay every thing and yield every thing, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that the plenty and &s;carcity of goods will govern the price. You mu&s;t admit too, that the plenty and &s;carcity of money will determine the value of that al&s;o. Why then will any one pretend to limit either, again&s;t the operation of this great principle? It is ea&s;y, in addition to all this, to prove that the price of imported articles in gene|ral does not exceed the value of them, if computed on the ex|pen&s;e of acquirement: but this I mean only to hint, and wave it for the pre&s;ent; and only wi&s;h &s;ome merchants of experi|ence and reputation would take it up, and publi&s;h the need|ful e&s;&s;ay on it.</P>
<P>Nor do I think that the &s;cheme of loans can give e&s;tabli&s;h|ment to the currency, or prevent its depreciation.&mdash;For</P>
<P N="1">1. All loans increa&s;e the public debt, and the immen&s;ity of the &s;um is one cau&s;e of the depreciation, as it induces people to think it never will be paid, or the payment will nece&s;&s;arily be delayed to &s;uch a di&s;tant period, as in point of u&s;e to the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or <HI>is nearly</HI> equal to total failure.</P>
<P N="2">2. If the credit of the Loan-Office is well &s;upported (as it mu&s;t be to give it any good effect) the Loan-Office certifi|cates them&s;elves will pa&s;s in payment, and &s;o become an addition to the currency which they are de&s;igned to le&s;&s;en.</P>
<P N="3">3. If foreign loans are negotiated, and bills &s;old here, drawn on the loaned bank in Europe, tho&s;e very bills will become a currency here, and &s;o add to the mi&s;chief.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="19" REF="023972_0026_0FC2BC19769EAA80">
4. The di&s;count on all European bills, is not le&s;s than 50 per cent. which lo&s;s mu&s;t immediately be &s;u&s;tained by the Continent on the fir&s;t &s;ale of them.</P>
<P N="5">5. If hard money, borrowed in Europe, &s;hould be im|ported and &s;old here, the in&s;urance, which is more than 50 per cent. mu&s;t be lo&s;t, nor can any man tell the mi&s;|chief which would attend any attempt to import hard mo|ney, and open offices for the &s;ale of it for continental bills: but a large group of the&s;e pre&s;ent them&s;elves too plainly to need enumeration.</P>
<P N="6">6. Nor do I think the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was a propo&s;al for a &s;ub&s;cription and immediate advance of mo|ney, to be di&s;counted on the future taxes, of the &s;ub&s;cribers.</NOTE> &s;cheme adopted by <HI>our Commit|tee</HI> promi&s;es better &s;ucce&s;s; for that propo&s;es Loaning with|out inducement; and if it &s;hould &s;ucceed to the utmo&s;t ex|pectation, it would drain the be&s;t friends to our cau&s;e of their money, whil&s;t our internal enemies would pay no|thing, for no compul&s;ion is propo&s;ed, and after all, it will be at be&s;t but an anticipation of the revenue, very danger|ous in the end; for the very <HI>wor&s;t</HI> thing that can be done re&s;pecting a revenue, is to <HI>de&s;troy it all,</HI> principal and u&s;e, and the <HI>next wor&s;t</HI> thing is to <HI>anticipate it, i. e.</HI> to &s;pend this year the rent and proceeds which will become due and payable next year, and the&s;e two are &s;o connected, that the latter generally brings on the former &s;ooner or later.</P>
<P>After all the&s;e objections to the various methods that have been propo&s;ed, it may be expected that I &s;hould propo&s;e &s;ome method that will be practicable and effectual to fix the value of our currency; and this I cannot think very difficult, either in theory or practice, though I have not one new thought to offer the public on the &s;ubject. We are now on the brink of ruin, and the wor&s;t di&s;grace, in dan|ger of lo&s;s of liberty hitherto nobly a&s;&s;erted, and &s;ubjecti|on to &s;hameful &s;lavery to enemies mo&s;t cruel and in&s;ulting in them&s;elves, and all that heightened in them to madne&s;s by the determined oppo&s;ition we have given to their &s;cheme of tyranny over us. All this danger ari&s;es not from our <HI>po|verty or want,</HI> for we have officers and &s;oldiers enough, &s;tores

<P>In matters of difficulty and importance, all wi&s;e coun|&s;ellors compare well the <HI>end</HI> and the <HI>means,</HI> on which two very weighty matters always pre&s;ent them&s;elves.</P>
<P N="1">1. Whether the means are &s;ufficient to &s;ecure and effect the end propo&s;ed.&mdash;And</P>
<P N="2">2. Whether the end is worth the means nece&s;&s;ary to ef|fect it. When the&s;e two points are &s;ettled, there remains no more room for con&s;ultation or debate, the re&s;t is all vi|gorous action, &s;trenuous exertion to put the means into &s;uch effectual execution as to obtain the end. This is a wi&s;e method of planning, which no man will have any ob|jection to. We will then adopt it in the con&s;ideration of the weighty &s;ubject now in view.</P>
<P N="1">1. The end is fixing our currency and preventing any fu|ture depreciation, and &s;o putting an effectual end to all the cheats, delu&s;ions, di&s;appointments, and ruinous lo&s;&s;es, which every one who has been concerned in it hath hi|therto felt, and giving every one a &s;ure and well grounded confidence in it in future.

<P N="2">2. The <HI>only means</HI> I conceive po&s;&s;ible to obtain this end, are to call in &s;uch &s;ums annually by taxes, as &s;hall be equal to the annual expenditures; this will prevent the increa&s;e of the money, will make a great demand for it through the Thirteen United States, will give it a bri&s;k circulation, will exhibit a mo&s;t convincing proof that it may be all called in and redeemed, and that it is the real de&s;ign of Congre&s;s to do this.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>No taxes had hitherto been collected, or other funds but Continental mo|ney and loans, provided for &s;upporting the war, which had la&s;ted four years, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> had any methods been adopted either to <HI>le&s;&s;en the quantity</HI> of that money, or even to prevent the <HI>increa&s;e of it,</HI> except the in&s;titution of the Loan-Office, October 3, 1776, which proved a remedy altogether inadequate to the purpo&s;e, and of cour&s;e the emi&s;&s;ions of that paper were multiplied, which together with the emi&s;&s;ions of the particular &s;tates, &s;welled the quantity &s;o much that the depreciation at that time (July 24, 1779) became very alarming; it was about 20 to 1, <HI>i. e.</HI> one dollar hard money would buy 20 dollars continental: the annual expen&s;e of &s;upporting an army of 50,000 men and a &s;mall navy, amounted to at lea&s;t ten millions of Mexican dollars.</P>

1. It is rare that the people refu&s;e burdens or even grum|ble under them, when, by general conviction, they are nece&s;&s;ary for the public good. And I dare &s;ay, that the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of fixing and e&s;tabli&s;hing our currency is become obvious to almo&s;t every individual on this Conti|nent, and the real nece&s;&s;ity of taxes for this purpo&s;e clear|ly &s;een by all.</P>
<P N="2">2. As far as my acquaintance with people of middling rank extends, they have been generally in favor of tax|ing for three years pa&s;t; they &s;ay this money mu&s;t be paid fir&s;t or la&s;t, and we can better pay it now whil&s;t we have little u&s;e for our money, whil&s;t it is plenty and ea&s;y to be got, than in future time, when we can perhaps not &s;o well &s;pare it, and when the getting it will be much more diffi|cult.</P>

The number of &s;ouls are computed at 3,000,000, in all the States, and of cour&s;e this would produce 12,000,000 bu&s;hels of wheat, which at 20 dollars per bu|&s;hel (the lowe&s;t pre&s;ent price) will be 240,000,000 millions of dollars, a &s;um greatly exceeding any annual exigence of the&s;e States; each State might apportion this as they plea&s;|ed, &s;o as to relieve the poor, and increa&s;e the &s;hare of the rich, but the middling farmer, who has ten in family, would have 40 bu&s;hels of wheat or its value, to pay in a year.</P>

<P>To facilitate this, I humbly propo&s;e one thing more, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> To take off every re&s;traint and limitation from our commerce. Let <HI>trade be as free as air.</HI> Let every man make the mo&s;t of his goods and in his own way, and then he will be &s;atisfied. Let every man ta&s;te and enjoy the &s;weets of that liberty of per&s;on and property, which was highly expected under an independent government. It is a &s;ad omen to find among the fir&s;t effects of independence, greater re&s;traints and abridgments of natural liberty, than ever we felt under the government we have lately renounc|ed and &s;haken off. Let the laws point out the <HI>duty,</HI> and be the bulwark of <HI>&s;ecurity</HI> of every man.</P>
<P>Nothing gives the people &s;uch high &s;atisfaction with any &s;y&s;tem of government they live under, as the actual enjoy|ment of the ine&s;timable ble&s;&s;ings of perfect liberty and full &s;ecurity under it; this will mo&s;t effectually induce them cheerfully to &s;upport it. No burdens will be thought hea|vy, or difficulties di&s;couraging, which the exigencies of go|vernment may require, when every man finds his own <HI>hap|pine&s;s</HI> involved in the <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hment</HI> of the State.</P>
<P>If, on the freedom of trade, any articles &s;hould ri&s;e in their price, the mi&s;chief facilitates this remedy, it makes the payment of the taxes more ea&s;y and tolerable. Whereas, if the taxes were collected during the limitation of the market and &s;tagnation of bu&s;ine&s;s, the payment would be extremely difficult, and the murmurs high and rea&s;onable; it would be almo&s;t like the Egyptians demanding brick without &s;traw. But when the circulation of money is bri&s;k, and the price and demand for goods high, every one knows that money may be rai&s;ed and taxes may be paid much more ea&s;ily than in dull times of &s;tagnated bu&s;ine&s;s. And this ought to be noticed on another account.</P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary our <HI>fir&s;t taxes</HI> &s;hould be rendered as <HI>ea&s;y</HI> as po&s;&s;ible to the people; for tho' high in nominal &s;um, if they find them ea&s;ily paid, the terror and unea&s;ine&s;s which

<P>II. <HI>How is the army to be &s;upplied?</HI> The method I propo&s;e, if it can be adopted, will undoubtedly fix the cur|rency and create a great demand for money, and a quick circulation of it; this will of cour&s;e open all the &s;tores in the State to any purcha&s;ers that may offer, and a <HI>little pru|dence</HI> u&s;ed in purcha&s;ing, may &s;upply the army to the full, at rea&s;onable prices. Indeed I am rather afraid of <HI>over|doing</HI> the thing in this way, &s;o far as to cau&s;e an <HI>apprecia|tion</HI> of the money, which I do not think ought ever to be done, for I &s;ee no rea&s;on why the States &s;hould be taxed to rai&s;e the money in my pocket to twenty times the cur|rent value of it; but this is a great argument, and may be the &s;ubject of future di&s;cu&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t add here, that this method will not only fix our currency and &s;upport our army, but will afford another ad|vantage of no &s;mall moment: it will take away the <HI>capital hope</HI> and <HI>a&s;&s;urance</HI> of our enemies of conquering us; for they depend more on the <HI>failure</HI> of our funds than on their <HI>own force,</HI> for this purpo&s;e; they count high on the quar|rels, contention, oppre&s;&s;ions, and mi&s;chiefs that will ari&s;e from the low, &s;inking credit of our money; and by this are encouraged to continue the war, which they would re|linqui&s;h as de&s;perate without it.</P>
<P>I will ju&s;t note here, that however intolerable the means I propo&s;e may appear at fir&s;t &s;ight, I cannot think them impracticable; the tax I propo&s;e is not more than two thirds of the annual taxes in Great Britain; the whole re|venue rai&s;ed every year there is about 12,500,000l. &s;ter|ling, which is &s;omewhat more than 55,000,000 dollars, reckoning them at 4s. 6d. a-piece; divide this by the num|ber of &s;ouls in Great Britain, which are computed at 9,000,000, and we have the &s;um of &s;omewhat more than 6 dollars per head on each of the inhabitants or living per|&s;ons there; but, be this as it may, to balance the argument

<HEAD>A SECOND ESSAY ON FREE TRADE and FINANCE.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Fir&s;t publi&s;hed in Philadelphia, Augu&s;t 1779, and dedicated to the &s;everal Legi&s;latures of the American Union.</HEAD>
<P>IN my la&s;t ESSAY I ob&s;erved, that the value of money was nothing in it&s;elf, it was a mere relation, it was the proportion between the medium of trade and the ob|jects of trade, which two will be for ever in balance, or equal the one to the other; therefore, if the money or me|dium of trade be increa&s;ed, whil&s;t the objects of trade or occa&s;ions of money continue the &s;ame, the value of the mo|ney mu&s;t depreciate or le&s;&s;en; and this depreciation mu&s;t and will be <HI>(coeteris paribus)</HI> according to the increa&s;e of the quantity.</P>
<P>It follows hence, <HI>that the value of the current money in any country, cannot be increa&s;ed by any additions made to its quanti|ty.</HI> I do not pretend that the&s;e propo&s;itions are ab&s;olutely univer&s;al&mdash;I know that money may be &s;o le&s;&s;ened in its quantity, as to be inadequate to the purpo&s;es of trade; in which ca&s;e, an addition to its quantity would doubtle&s;s add to its value and u&s;e. It is equally true, that the quantity of money may be increa&s;ed to &s;uch an immen&s;ity of exce&s;s, that the very bulk or enormous ma&s;s would render it incon|venient for a medium of trade. I do not mean, nor does my argument require, that my propo&s;itions &s;hould be ap|plied
<PB N="28" REF="023972_0035_0FC2BC4C2C841E40">
to either of the&s;e extremes; it is &s;ufficient for my purpo&s;e, that they hold true in any country where the mo|ney or medium of trade is &s;o duly adapted and proportioned to the objects of trade, that the one is found adequate and &s;ufficient for the other; in which ca&s;e, any departure from the &s;aid due proportion, either by increa&s;ing or decrea&s;ing the medium, mu&s;t verge either towards one or the other of the&s;e extremes, and partake more or le&s;s of their di&s;advan|tages.</P>
<P>It follows from the above, that <HI>our national debt of Con|tinental money has not increa&s;ed in value for three years pa&s;t, notwith&s;tanding the va&s;t increa&s;e of the bulk or nominal &s;um;</HI> and this propo&s;ition is proved from fact (which is the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible proof of any principle advanced in theory) for it is evident that it would not require one farthing more <HI>real va|lue,</HI> &s;ay country produce or hard money, to buy up every Continental dollar <HI>now</HI> in circulation, than would have been nece&s;&s;ary <HI>three years ago,</HI> to purcha&s;e all that was then in circulation; <HI>i. e.</HI> the depreciation has kept full pace with its increa&s;e of quantity. Indeed, I am of opi|nion, it rather <HI>exceeds</HI> this proportion, <HI>i. e.</HI> that the money has depreciated fa&s;ter than the increa&s;e of its quantity would require, and that it would of cour&s;e require a le&s;s real value to purcha&s;e it all now, than would have bought it all three years ago. I think the enormity of the &s;um has carried it within the &s;en&s;ible influence of that <HI>fatal ex|treme</HI> which mu&s;t finally de&s;troy its whole value and u&s;e, if the quantity continues to increa&s;e.</P>
<P>It appears then that we do not owe a &s;hilling more of <HI>real value</HI> than we owed three years ago, except the debt abroad and the loans at home which have been contracted &s;ince; &s;o that our finances are not in &s;o deplorable a &s;tate as they &s;eem to be, and a remedy is much more in our power than would be imagined on the fir&s;t view of the matter, and may be adopted for three years to come, if the war &s;hould continue &s;o long, with le&s;s <HI>burden, hard&s;hip, oppre&s;&s;ion, danger, damage,</HI> and <HI>lo&s;s</HI> than we have, to our &s;orrow, experienced for three years pa&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="023972_0036_0FC2BC4D8D287C08">
It follows then, that <HI>all the expenditures of the war for three years pa&s;t except the foreign debts and internal loans</HI> (in which la&s;t I include the monies due for lottery prizes) <HI>have been actually paid in depreciation of our currency,</HI> which is perhaps the mo&s;t inconvenient method of levying pub|lic taxes that could be invented.</P>
<P>As this propo&s;ition may be new to &s;ome people, I only beg they would not be &s;tartled too much at it, but have patience to read a few lines further, in which I &s;hall con|&s;ider both parts of it.</P>
<P>Without going into minute calculations of the depre|ciation, or determining with preci&s;ion the pre&s;ent exchange, I imagine it will not be di&s;puted that the depreciation for three years pa&s;t has been at lea&s;t <HI>fifty per cent.</HI> per ann. <HI>i. e.</HI> that <HI>one hundred pounds</HI> at the end of the year, would not buy more goods than <HI>fifty pounds</HI> would have purcha&s;ed at the beginning of the year. Try it for the year pa&s;t: in Augu&s;t 1778, fifty pounds would have purcha&s;ed &s;ixteen hundred of flour, fifty bu&s;hels of Indian corn, five hun|dred of bar iron, one and an half hundred of &s;ugar, twelve pounds of hard money, &amp;c. See if one hundred pounds will buy as much now.</P>
<P>This is arguing on fact, which is &s;tubborn and yields to the prejudice of no man. It appears then that a man who has kept one hundred pounds by him for the &s;pace of one year, is to all intents in the &s;ame condition he would have been in, if the hundred pounds had kept its value un|depreciated, and he had paid one half of it in a tax, <HI>i. e.</HI> in both ca&s;es he would have had fifty pounds and no more left. He has then, to all intents and purpo&s;es, paid a tax of fifty pounds for the year towards the depreciation, and has now fifty pounds le&s;s money than he would have had if no depreciation had taken place, as much in every re&s;pect as his ca&s;h would have le&s;&s;ened fifty pounds by paying a tax of that &s;um.</P>
<P>I have heard that this plea was made u&s;e of by the Agents of the <HI>New-England</HI> colonies, when the matter of reimbur&s;ements to tho&s;e colonies, for their great expendi|tures in the two la&s;t wars, was debated and granted in the
<PB N="30" REF="023972_0037_0FC2BC4F09A1F140">
<HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament, and the argument allowed to be a good one. The que&s;tion was, what &s;ums tho&s;e colonies had emitted for the &s;ervice of the wars, and what was the va|lue of the bills to be redeemed? the Agents pleaded, that the value was to be e&s;timated at the <HI>time of emi&s;&s;ion,</HI> not at the <HI>time of redemption</HI> of tho&s;e bills; for when bills of cre|dit depreciate in any country, <HI>the depreciation is as much a tax on the inhabitants as the depreciated &s;um would be, if levied in the u&s;ual way of a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment on polls and e&s;tates.</HI> The argu|ment is indeed a demon&s;trable one, and &s;upported and ju&s;|tified by plain fact in every view; yet there is &s;uch a <HI>&s;ubtle and &s;trong delu&s;ion</HI> in the depreciation as ob&s;cures the &s;ubject, and will almo&s;t cheat a man who views it un|der full conviction, and feels the effects of it; and this tends to render the <HI>mi&s;chief more ruinous</HI> than otherwi&s;e it would be, becau&s;e people who feel it, often <HI>mi&s;take the cau&s;e,</HI> and adopt from thence remedies altogether <HI>in|effectual,</HI> and &s;ometimes very <HI>hurtful,</HI> and which often tend rather to <HI>increa&s;e</HI> than <HI>cure</HI> the evil.</P>
<P>Of this &s;ort, I take to be the whole torrent of <HI>cen&s;ure and abu&s;e</HI> which has been thrown out and kept up again&s;t the merchants, farmers, and trade&s;men, for rai&s;ing the prices of their &s;everal fabrics and goods. Of this &s;ort like|wi&s;e, I con&s;ider the ab&s;urd &s;cheme of <HI>limitation of prices,</HI> which never fails to limit goods out of the market, at lea&s;t out of &s;ight; prevents importations and manufactures, di&s;|courages the adventures of the mo&s;t patriotic merchants, who keep their money in trade through all ri&s;ks, in order to produce foreign goods, without which, neither the coun|try could be &s;upplied, nor the war be &s;upported; checks the indu&s;try of the farmers and trade&s;men, without which all internal &s;upplies mu&s;t fail; fills the minds of all with ill humor, and rai&s;es the country into factions and heated parties, zealous to devour one another, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>The&s;e are only a few of the evils which ari&s;e from mi&s;|taken cau&s;es of the depreciation of our currency, and the con&s;equent improper methods adopted for its remedy, all which prove the ab&s;urdity as well as the reality of defraying the expenditures of the war in that way, which naturally
<PB N="31" REF="023972_0038_0FC2BC5081684290">
brings on the con&s;ideration of the &s;econd part of my pro|po&s;ition, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> this method of paying the expen&s;es of the war is very inconvenient.</P>
<P N="1">1. Becau&s;e this method brings the burden beyond due proportion, on the mo&s;t <HI>virtuous and u&s;eful</HI> of our people, &s;uch as by prudence and economy have made money and got a good command of ca&s;h, lying in debts due on mort|gages, bonds, book-debts, &amp;c. and at the &s;ame time ope|rates in favor of the mo&s;t <HI>worthle&s;s men</HI> among&s;t us, the <HI>di&s;&s;ipating, &s;lack, lazy,</HI> and <HI>dilatory</HI> &s;ort, who commonly keep them&s;elves in debt, and live on the fortunes of others. The&s;e contemptible, u&s;ele&s;s characters are enabled hereby, after keeping a creditor years out of his ju&s;t due, to pay him off with one <HI>fourth,</HI> yea, one <HI>eighth,</HI> yea, one <HI>&s;ix|teenth,</HI> yea, one <HI>twentieth</HI> part of the value of the debt when it was contracted, by which the frugal and indu&s;tri|ous are compelled to pay a very heavy tax to tho&s;e u&s;ele&s;s, idle men, by which many of them have acquired great for|tunes, and of cour&s;e great weight among us, to the ma|nife&s;t damage of the public; for the weight and influence of this &s;ort of men, ought never to be increa&s;ed in any community, for wherever we &s;ee one of them taking the lead among the people, we have rea&s;on to believe that mi&s;|chief is a brewing, and that the public peace and &s;ecurity is more or le&s;s in danger. For the truth of this, I appeal to the experience and ob&s;ervation of all wi&s;e and good men.</P>
<P N="2">2. In this way the burden comes very heavy on the mo&s;t <HI>helple&s;s part of our people,</HI> who are mo&s;t entitled to the pro|tection of the &s;tate, and ought not to have their burdens increa&s;ed; &s;uch as widows, orphans, and old men, who&s;e principal dependence is on legacies, money at intere&s;t, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="3">3. It oppre&s;&s;es the <HI>&s;alary-men</HI> and <HI>all public officers,</HI> both in church and &s;tate, who&s;e fees and &s;alaries are reduced to almo&s;t nothing, and any applications for relief are apt to rai&s;e an unrea&s;onable clamor again&s;t them, as if avarice and greedine&s;s of money was their principal pa&s;&s;ion. This pre|judices the public &s;ervice, in which they are employed, and di&s;courages men of abilities from &s;eeking or accepting &s;uch
<PB N="32" REF="023972_0039_0FC2BC5F64381C28">
public offices, and le&s;&s;ens the weight and influence of tho&s;e who hold them.</P>
<P N="4">4. This di&s;courages <HI>indu&s;try and trade;</HI> for if the profits obtained by the&s;e wa&s;te in the de&s;k, there is little induce|ment to increa&s;e the &s;tock.</P>
<P N="5">5. This defrauds the <HI>army of their pay</HI> and appointments, and <HI>di&s;courages inli&s;tments,</HI> and promotes de&s;ertions, &amp;c. Many would like the army very well, if they could live by the profe&s;&s;ion; but few are &s;o attached to it as to be willing to be ruined there.</P>
<P N="6">6. It makes <HI>&s;upplies for the army difficult</HI> to be obtained; becau&s;e few men are fond of carrying the fruits of their year's labor to the army, to be &s;old for a peri&s;hing medium, which every day grows wor&s;e and wor&s;e.</P>
<P N="7">7. The whole &s;y&s;tem is grounded <HI>in inju&s;tice, is contrary to the fir&s;t maxims of upright dealing, and corrupts the whole cour&s;e of trade and commutative ju&s;tice,</HI> and of cour&s;e will &s;oon <HI>de&s;troy</HI> all principles of <HI>morality</HI> and <HI>hone&s;ty</HI> in trade, among the people; for here it is to be con&s;idered, that mo|ney is not only the <HI>in&s;trument or means</HI> by which trade is carried on, but becomes a &s;ort of <HI>common mea&s;ure of the va|lue of all articles of trade;</HI> and therefore I &s;hould conceive it would be as dangerous to adopt any mea&s;ures which would alter its value and render it fluctuating, as to alter the <HI>&s;tandard weights</HI> and <HI>mea&s;ures,</HI> by which the quantity of goods &s;old in market is u&s;ually a&s;certained:&mdash;as for example, to &s;horten the &s;tandard <HI>yard,</HI> le&s;&s;en the &s;tandard <HI>bu&s;hel,</HI> or dimini&s;h the &s;tandard <HI>pound</HI> weight, or adopt any mea&s;ures that tend to this, and will probably effect it. We ea&s;ily &s;ee the dangerous con&s;equences, nor can there be any nece&s;&s;ity to expo&s;e here the ab&s;urdities and mi&s;chiefs which mu&s;t follow.</P>
<P>Enough has been &s;aid on this dreary &s;ubject; the mi&s;|chiefs are too glaring to need further proof; a remedy is the great thing now to be &s;ought: ought we then to at|tempt a remedy of the mi&s;chiefs of <HI>depreciation,</HI> by any en|deavour to <HI>appreciate</HI> our currency? I think not.</P>
<P N="1">1. Becau&s;e the &s;um depreciated has been <HI>paid by the coun|try once already,</HI> by the depreciation it&s;elf in their hands,
<PB N="33" REF="023972_0040_0FC2BC60EB013760">
and there is no rea&s;on why the &s;ame country &s;hould be tax|ed to pay it over again: <HI>i. e.</HI> every man who has had a hun|dred pounds in his pocket a month, has paid four per cent. <HI>i. e.</HI> four pounds of tax for it at lea&s;t; but this is not the wor&s;t of it, for he has likewi&s;e paid four per cent. per month on all the monies that were due to him during the whole time (by which the public were not benefited.) But exe|crable as this method of &s;upplying the public exigencies may be, it has had its <HI>full effect,</HI> and therefore there can be no rea&s;on that payment &s;hould be made over again.</P>

<P N="9">9. <HI>This plan of appreciation would not be any remedy to the principal &s;ufferers by the depreciation;</HI> for not one tenth part of the appreciated currency would probably be found in the &s;ame hands that &s;uffered by the depreciation; the in|crea&s;e of tax would be more to the greate&s;t part of the peo|ple, than all the profits they would gain by the apprecia|tion.</P>
<P N="10">10. It is not &s;uppo&s;able that <HI>thirteen General A&s;&s;emblies would concur in voting and levying</HI> &s;uch a u&s;ele&s;s, burden|&s;ome, and pernicious tax:&mdash;nor if they would, is it likely that the people either <HI>could</HI> or <HI>would</HI> pay it.&mdash;Therefore,</P>
<P N="11">11. It appears that the&s;e rea&s;ons, which prove that this <HI>ought not</HI> to be done, all tend to prove that it <HI>cannot</HI> be done, and this is a good rea&s;on why it ought not to be <HI>at|tempted.</HI> But to &s;um up the whole argument in one word,</P>
<P N="12">12. All the mi&s;chiefs ari&s;ing from a <HI>depreciation,</HI> would equally ari&s;e from an <HI>appreciation;</HI> but in an <HI>inver&s;ed order,</HI> and I think it will appear plain to any per&s;on of di&s;cern|ment, who duly and attentively con&s;iders it, that inver&s;ing the order, will infer many mi&s;chiefs <HI>more ruinous</HI> to the community, than tho&s;e we have already felt from the de|preciation: but in any view, the very idea that we are to live under the cur&s;e of a fluctuating currency eighteen years longer is intolerable.</P>
<P>Therefore I humbly propo&s;e, that the fooli&s;h method of <HI>denying</HI> the depreciation or <HI>lowering</HI> it below what it really is, may be wholly di&s;continued, and that as &s;oon as the va|lue of the currency is fixed, there may be a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This idea of forming a &s;cale of depreciation, I believe was the fir&s;t ever propo&s;ed in <HI>America,</HI> and was much cen&s;ured and even reprobated at fir&s;t, but &s;oon afterwards was adopted by Congre&s;s and all the States.</NOTE> <HI>&s;cale</HI> or <HI>table</HI> of exchange e&s;tabli&s;hed as near as may be to its then pre|&s;ent true value, and that hard money be received and paid in the Continental Trea&s;ury according to it: this will effec|tually prevent its appreciation, and if means can be found to collect monies &s;ufficient for future expenditures, which

I do not think difficult, no further depreciation need be apprehended, the currency will become fixed, which is all that the &s;afety of the &s;tate requires, and all that we can rea|&s;onably hope for, or even wi&s;h to accompli&s;h.</P>
<P>I beg leave to in&s;ert here one propo&s;ition more, which I think deducible from the foregoing ones, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that if any country which had a medium of trade properly balanced and adapted to the purpo&s;es of trade, &s;hould by any means receive a large <HI>addition of money</HI> without an <HI>increa&s;e of the ob|jects</HI> of money, it would be more the intere&s;t of that coun|try to <HI>call in,</HI> and <HI>de&s;troy</HI> that additional quantity by taxes (if it could not be drained off &s;peedily &s;ome other way) than <HI>to let it circulate</HI> among them; for example, if by opening mines, by large trea&s;ure trove, by large &s;ucce&s;s and captures in war, or by too many pre&s;&s;es the money &s;hould be in|crea&s;ed beyond the due quantity nece&s;&s;ary for the purpo&s;es of a medium of trade: in &s;uch ca&s;e, I give my opinion, that it would be more for the benefit of &s;uch country, to call in and de&s;troy <HI>&s;uch &s;urplu&s;age</HI> of ca&s;h, by taxes equally levied on all, than to <HI>permit it to circulate</HI> among them.&mdash;For</P>
<P N="1">1. This <HI>increa&s;ed</HI> quantity of money, if &s;uffered to circu|late, would <HI>depreciate</HI> till it had duly diffu&s;ed it&s;elf over the country, when it would acquire a <HI>certain rate</HI> of exchange, and its value would become fixed in &s;uch a manner, that <HI>the value of the whole</HI> would be ju&s;t equal to the <HI>value of the money which was in circulation before the increa&s;e happened,</HI> and con&s;equently the country would gain nothing by it, but an increa&s;ed <HI>nominal &s;um;</HI> ju&s;t as if the <HI>&s;tandard yard</HI> &s;hould be <HI>&s;hortened</HI> one half, and thereby increa&s;e the num|ber of yards of cloth in the country to double the former number, but would not add <HI>one inch of new cloth,</HI> or enable the owners of all the cloth to make <HI>one garment more</HI> than before. But</P>
<P N="2">2. While this was doing, <HI>va&s;t mi&s;chief</HI> would ari&s;e from the depreciation; the <HI>legacies</HI> of the widow and orphans, the <HI>&s;alaries</HI> and <HI>fees</HI> of public officers of church and &s;tate, the <HI>pay of the army,</HI> the value of all <HI>debts due,</HI> the <HI>&s;tandard</HI> of all contracts for money, &amp;c. would be <HI>le&s;&s;ened</HI> to the mo&s;t manife&s;t injury of the creditors. Examples of
<PB N="36" REF="023972_0043_0FC2BC7138EBEA28">
which dreadful effects we &s;ee daily before our eyes&mdash;this mu&s;t &s;urely force the mo&s;t &s;triking conviction.</P>
<P N="3">3. I conceive the&s;e mi&s;chiefs would prove a much <HI>heavier burden</HI> on the country, and would have <HI>much wor&s;e effects,</HI> than could ari&s;e from <HI>a tax to amount of the increa&s;ed quantity</HI> of money levied on the inhabitants.&mdash;For</P>
<P N="4">4. The inhabitants could <HI>not be impoveri&s;hed by &s;uch a tax,</HI> as there would be as much value of money, and as much goods and other e&s;tate in the country after the tax was le|vied as before, and all the lo&s;s to the country would be the time and charges &s;pent in collecting it; for all the goods &s;old for the payment of this tax, would &s;till remain in the country, and continue as valuable as they were before they were &s;old.</P>
<P N="5">5. The <HI>contentions, re&s;entments, and ill-humor,</HI> which a depreciation naturally generates, would by this method <HI>be prevented,</HI> which alone, in my opinion would, if not pre|vented, impoveri&s;h the country <HI>more than the whole tax,</HI> even if the money was all borrowed from abroad to pay it. Only ob&s;erve two neighbours inflamed with rage and re|&s;entment again&s;t each other, and &s;ee what time, money, and labor they will &s;pend, and how much they will en|gage their &s;everal friends in their quarrel, and how all kind offices of friend&s;hip and mutual a&s;&s;i&s;tance are totally lo&s;t be|tween them during their anger. By this we may form &s;ome gue&s;s at the degree of impoveri&s;hment which a coun|try mu&s;t &s;uffer by general di&s;contents, and numberle&s;s in|&s;tances of per&s;onal injuries and con&s;equent re&s;entments.</P>
<P>Hence it follows clearly, in my opinion, that it would be more for the intere&s;t of the Thirteen United States to <HI>call in and &s;ink</HI> their Continental bills as fa&s;t as they i&s;&s;ue, than to receive <HI>a &s;um of gold</HI> every year equal to the money i&s;&s;ued, from &s;ome foreign power, as a perfect gift never to be repaid, <HI>i. e.</HI> we had better pay every year, by taxes, the whole expenditures of the year, than to receive the amount of tho&s;e expenditures in ca&s;h from <HI>Spain</HI> as a free gift. Tho' I introduce this propo&s;ition as a corollary, yet as it is of &s;ome con&s;equence, we will, if you plea&s;e, view it awhile, and con&s;ider the operation and effects of its two
<PB N="37" REF="023972_0044_0FC2BC7287E846D8">
parts, and we &s;hall be better able to judge which of the two would contribute mo&s;t to the real welfare and happi|ne&s;s of the country.</P>
<P N="1">1. The tax would <HI>fix the currency,</HI> and thereby give e&s;ta|bli&s;hment to every branch and department of <HI>bu&s;ine&s;s, trade, war, civil police, and religion,</HI> which has any connexion with money; but the gift would make &s;uch an increa&s;e of the circulating ca&s;h as would depreciate it (for hard money can and will depreciate as well as paper bills, if increa&s;ed too much) and thereby every department of <HI>bu&s;ine&s;s, trade, war, civil police, and religion</HI> which has any connexion with money, mu&s;t langui&s;h and be enervated.</P>
<P N="2">2. The tax will <HI>promote the indu&s;try, prudence, and econo|my</HI> of the people, but the <HI>gift</HI> would naturally introduce and encourage <HI>idlene&s;s</HI> and <HI>di&s;&s;ipation.</HI> Few men will ri&s;e early and eat the bread of carefulne&s;s, when money flows in upon them without their own anxious care. A man, pre&s;&s;ed with a demand for money for a tax or any other debt, does not yield to his own appetite, or the reque&s;t of his wife or child for a luxury, &s;o ea&s;ily as the &s;ame man would do, with plenty of money, and no pre&s;&s;ing demand: for the truth of this I appeal to the feelings of every man.</P>
<P>No virtue is &s;o fixed in the human mind as to continue long undimini&s;hed without its u&s;ual motives and inducements, and it requires no great experience in the world to &s;how us the danger of le&s;&s;ening any of the&s;e; the very beginning of remi&s;&s;ne&s;s of virtuous habits ought to be as alarming as the &s;wallowing of a &s;low poi&s;on; and this, as applied to my &s;ubject, is demon&s;trated by a very common ob&s;ervation, that fortunes &s;uddenly acquired with|out the <HI>indu&s;try</HI> of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, rarely ever increa&s;e his happine&s;s and welfare, help his virtuous habits, or conti|nue long with him; they mo&s;t commonly ruin him. Mo|ney in a &s;tate is like &s;alt in cookery; &s;ome of it is very ne|ce&s;&s;ary, but too much of it &s;poils every di&s;h, and renders the whole dinner un&s;avory to the ta&s;te, and hurtful to the health.</P>
<P N="3">3. The tax will operate in <HI>a way of ju&s;tice</HI> to all, and therefore will give <HI>general peace and &s;atisfaction to all good
<PB N="38" REF="023972_0045_0FC2BC73A96F3938">
men,</HI> to all genuine Whigs and well-di&s;po&s;ed people, and will &s;ilence the clamors and di&s;appoint the hopes of the Tories, which are grounded principally on the unea&s;ine&s;s and jealou&s;ies, injuries and re&s;entments which wrong &s;teps will rai&s;e among the people. The operation of the tax would be ju&s;t this; it would compel the man who &s;tays at home and renders no actual &s;ervice, and furni&s;hes no &s;up|plies to the war, to pay as much as tho&s;e do, who render the actual &s;ervice and furni&s;h the &s;upplies: tho&s;e who ren|der per&s;onal &s;ervice and furni&s;h &s;upplies, contribute tho&s;e great aids in &s;olid &s;ub&s;tance within the year; and therefore tho&s;e who &s;tay at home ought to pay their quotas of &s;olid &s;ub&s;tance al&s;o within the year. There can be no rea&s;on given why tho&s;e that go into the war &s;hould render their &s;ervice within the year, and tho&s;e who &s;tay at home &s;hould pay nothing, or be tru&s;ted to &s;ome future day.</P>
<P>This method is grounded on &s;uch manife&s;t ju&s;tice, that no Tory, however litigious, can with any good face object to it; and therefore, however chagrined at heart he may be, he mu&s;t keep his mouth &s;hut, or look out for &s;ome other &s;ubject of complaint to make a noi&s;e about; but the natural operation of the gift would be very contrary to this; there would be &s;o many &s;chemes and pretences &s;et on foot to draw for the money before it could leave <HI>Spain;</HI> &s;o ma|ny hungry favorites crowding round every office of di&s;tribution in every department, and in &s;hort, &s;uch a &s;cramble for the bigge&s;t &s;hare of it; and &s;o much chagrin, di&s;appointment, and mortification occa&s;ioned; and &s;o ma|ny jealou&s;ies, quarrels, and re&s;entments excited by it, as would, in my opinion, injure and impoveri&s;h the States much more than the tax would do. But all this I &s;ubmit to tho&s;e who have been be&s;t acquainted with public boards and offices.</P>
<P N="4">4. The mo&s;t of the above arguments have been <HI>confirmed by facts</HI> in many notorious in&s;tances, which are the be&s;t proofs in matters of this &s;ort which can be advanced: the &s;poils and luxuries of <HI>Capua</HI> ruined <HI>Hannibal'</HI>s army; the &s;ack of <HI>Carthage</HI> and plunder of the rich, ea&s;tern, con|quered provinces corrupted the morals of the <HI>Romans,</HI> de|&s;troyed
<PB N="39" REF="023972_0046_0FC2BC753B5A59E8">
their economy, brought in luxurious exce&s;&s;es, bred the mo&s;t mortal quarrels, overturned the commonwealth, introduced tyranny, and ended in the mo&s;t tragical de|&s;truction of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire; the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> (who were once mo&s;t untainted in morals and mo&s;t intrepid in war) it is &s;aid, were ruined by the mines of the <HI>Bra&s;ils,</HI> and are now an enervated people, without manufactures and internal &s;upplies, a nation of Lords, poor in the mid&s;t of money, and proud in the mid&s;t of want, and are &s;carce a &s;hadow of their ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>And to come nearer home, the &s;ucce&s;&s;es and &s;poils of the la&s;t war ruined the <HI>Engli&s;h nation;</HI> they are no longer that wi&s;e, that faithful, that benevolent, humane nation which we were ever taught to e&s;teem them, but rude, faithle&s;s, cruel, &s;avage, avaricious, &s;ordid, &amp;c. with &s;carce a &s;ingle virtue left in their character; the principal remains of our ance&s;tors is their prowe&s;s in war; but even this is perverted: this, which was heroi&s;m in them, is inhumani|ty in the pre&s;ent generation; the &s;word, which was the terror of their <HI>enemies,</HI> is by the pre&s;ent race &s;heathed in the bowels of their <HI>brethren.</HI></P>
<P>It follows hence, I conceive, very clearly, that the riches of a nation do not con&s;i&s;t in the abundance of money, but in number of people, in &s;upplies and re&s;ources, in the ne|ce&s;&s;aries and conveniencies of life, in good laws, good pub|lic officers, in virtuous citizens, in &s;trength and concord, in wi&s;dom, in ju&s;tice, in wi&s;e coun&s;els, and manly force.</P>
<P>From all the&s;e con&s;iderations, it appears plain to me, that &s;udden acqui&s;itions of money are dangerous to any country, and have in many in&s;tances proved very ruinous and fatal to &s;tates and kingdoms as well as individuals; from hence I think we may fairly and &s;trongly conclude, that it is not the wi&s;dom of <HI>America</HI> to attempt by any means of gift or loan, an acqui&s;ition of money from any foreign powers, but by &s;trong exertions of our own to fur|ni&s;h our own &s;upplies. We have money enough for our own purpo&s;es, and as good as any in the world, if we can be wi&s;e and firm enough, by proper mea&s;ures to fix its va|lue, and pre&s;erve it from future fluctuation.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="023972_0047_0FC2BC769D120FF8">
But if the&s;e arguments &s;hould not be convincing, I will venture to add one more, which with me has great weight.</P>
<P N="5">5. By a tax we &s;hall furni&s;h <HI>our own &s;upplies</HI> in a <HI>&s;ure</HI> way, not liable to <HI>di&s;appointment</HI> by any caprices of <HI>others,</HI> nor &s;ubjecting us to any &s;ort of <HI>dependence on foreigners;</HI> we &s;hall work out our own &s;alvation without dependence on any power but Divine Providence, which we may ever acknowledge without danger of in&s;ult; but if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> receive aids from foreign &s;tates by loan or gift, the obligation con|ferred on us will be ever great in their opinion, and &s;hould we ever have occa&s;ion in future time to adopt any mea&s;ures not perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with their views and de|mands, we mu&s;t be in&s;ulted with large exhibitions of the pre&s;ent favors, and as large and plentiful accu&s;ations of ingratitude, and it may be long before we hear the la&s;t of it.</P>
<P>As it is more reputable for a man to acquire a fortune by his own indu&s;try, than by heir&s;hip, favor of friends, or &s;udden accidents, &s;o I think our own deliverance and e&s;ta|bli&s;hment, wrought out by our own &s;trong exertions and virtuous efforts, will be more honorable and &s;afe for us, than to receive the&s;e great ble&s;&s;ings from the gift of a neighbour, were he willing to be&s;tow them. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> never will have done holding up to the view of the <HI>Dutch</HI> the &s;upplies and aids they received from the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in Queen <HI>Elizabeth'</HI>s time, and the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> are obliged to hear a great deal of the &s;ame &s;ort of language, on the &s;core of a&s;&s;i&s;tances received by them from the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in the late wars.</P>
<P>Indeed I know not how we can call our&s;elves independ|ent, if we are to lie under &s;uch &s;ort of debts to our neigh|bours, e&s;pecially if to the obligations of gratitude, we are to be loaded with the additional one of large &s;ums of hard money, with a corroding, annual intere&s;t to devour the proceeds of our labors and trade for ages to come.</P>
<P>I would &s;ooner con&s;ent to bear any pre&s;ent burden, not ab&s;olutely intolerable, than find my&s;elf and po&s;terity load|ed with &s;uch a heavy, galling debt, to la&s;t, as other nati|onal debts mo&s;t commonly do, <HI>for ever,</HI> and the States &s;o

oppre&s;&s;ed and drained by it, as to have &s;carce &s;pirits or &s;trength left to re&s;ent any in&s;ults or injuries that may be offered in future time, or repel any inva&s;ions that may be attempted.</P>
<P>Indeed the alliance we have formed with <HI>France,</HI> is grounded on &s;uch generous principles of <HI>ju&s;tice, mutual in|tere&s;t,</HI> and <HI>independence,</HI> as plainly demon&s;trate that it is not the wi&s;h of <HI>France</HI> that our minds ever &s;hould be di&s;|turbed by any of the&s;e painful feelings; and I think it would be very mean in us to abu&s;e their genero&s;ity, and we might <HI>be a&s;hamed to worry them</HI> for &s;upplies, which we could <HI>better furni&s;h</HI> our&s;elves than receive from them, e&s;pe|cially to &s;olicit <HI>France</HI> for money to pay the <HI>intere&s;t of loans</HI> from our own people, certainly has a bad look. If a &s;on &s;hould demand &s;ecurity of a &s;tranger for monies lent to his father, people would certainly &s;ay &s;omething.&mdash;</P>
<P>We hope to form an alliance with <HI>Spain</HI> on principles of equal ju&s;tice and mutual benefit, but we &s;hall &s;oon le&s;&s;en our character in their eyes, if we improve our fir&s;t ac|quaintance in begging aids, which, with proper application and indu&s;try, we could well do without. But whenever real nece&s;&s;ity does pre&s;s us beyond our own powers of re|lief, we may then, without humiliation, apply for help to our friends, and I do not doubt but they would give with plea&s;ure to our real nece&s;&s;ity, what they would either deny or grudgingly &s;pare to our lazine&s;s or needle&s;s &s;olicita|tions.</P>
<P>I pre&s;ume it is needle&s;s to add any more arguments to prove the nece&s;&s;ity or expediency of taxing equal to our expenditures, but the great groan &s;till is, that <HI>this is im|practicable,</HI> it cannot be done. To all I have &s;aid before, I beg leave here to add &s;ome further arguments to prove the <HI>practicability</HI> of this method; three years ago, it was &s;aid, <HI>there is no danger yet,</HI> it will be time enough to tax &s;ome time hence; it is now &s;aid, <HI>it is too late,</HI> we are in|volved &s;o much that a tax adequate to our pre&s;ent occa&s;ions for money is impo&s;&s;ible; had we begun &s;ooner, it might have been done, but now it is too late.

All the &s;ervices and &s;upplies for which the tax is wanted, <HI>are actually furni&s;hed every year</HI> by the Thirteen States, and have been for four years pa&s;t; now is it more po&s;&s;ible, more rea&s;onable, or more ea&s;y <HI>to compel a few</HI> in|dividuals to furni&s;h the&s;e &s;ervices and &s;upplies <HI>without pay|ment,</HI> than <HI>to lay the burden</HI> in proper proportion on
<PB N="43" REF="023972_0050_0FC2BC8741FC02C8">
all, and <HI>to compel every individual</HI> to furni&s;h his part? <HI>i. e.</HI> I do contend it is more ea&s;y, more rea&s;onable, and therefore more practicable, and of cour&s;e very po&s;&s;ible to compel <HI>tho&s;e that &s;tay at home</HI> and render neither per&s;onal &s;ervices nor &s;upplies to the war, to pay <HI>as much real value or &s;ub&s;tance</HI> in money as tho&s;e do who <HI>render the &s;ervices</HI> or furni&s;h the &s;upplies; and if any of the&s;e &s;tayers at home think this comes too hard on them, let them change places awhile with tho&s;e that do render the &s;ervices or furni&s;h the &s;upplies, <HI>i. e.</HI> let them go into the army in per&s;on, or &s;end their corn, their beef, or other &s;upplies, and when they have tried both, they will know which is ea&s;ie&s;t, and will always have their option to take the one or the other, and will be convinced that both are po&s;&s;ible and practica|ble.</P>
<P>Can any man make any rea&s;onable and weighty objec|tion to this? Yet this is all that is required; for when the &s;ervices are rendered, and the &s;upplies are furni&s;hed, and both are paid for, the whole bu&s;ine&s;s is done, and the tax has had its full effect.</P>
<P>I will venture to add my opinion, that this rea&s;oning will be verified in fact to very good purpo&s;e, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that when it is ob&s;erved that the man who <HI>renders the actual &s;ervice</HI> is paid fully for it, and the man who <HI>&s;tays at home</HI> mu&s;t pay his full quota towards it, many who now &s;tay at home, will be induced to go and render the actual &s;ervice, and thereby avoid making the payment at home, and be|come entitled to receive it in the army, which will greatly facilitate the recruiting &s;ervice. An object of no &s;mall magnitude.</P>
<P N="3">3. The tax which I propo&s;e, collected in quarterly or monthly payments, will occa&s;ion &s;uch <HI>a quick circulation of money,</HI> that every bill will probably pay its value <HI>many times over</HI> in a year, as it mu&s;t do every time it pa&s;&s;es from hand to hand; it will fly from the Commi&s;&s;ary to the farmer, from him to the Collector, from him to the Trea&s;urer, from him to the Commi&s;&s;ary, from him to the farmer again, &amp;c. in a circle often repeated in a year; con&s;e|quently it would be po&s;&s;ible to levy a Sum in a year by
<PB N="44" REF="023972_0051_0FC2BC94AF44BD10">
taxes, much exceeding the whole &s;um of current ca&s;h; it would render the whole Thirteen States like a full market, where all per&s;ons are eager to &s;ell all they have for &s;ale, and as eager to buy all which they have need of, and if this circle of bu&s;ine&s;s was permitted to run without any re&s;traints, it would render the procurement and payment of money as ea&s;y as the nature of the thing admits, would va&s;tly lighten the burden of taxes, and would give &s;uch great advantages, both to the farmer, mechanic, and tra|der, as would in good mea&s;ure reimbur&s;e the tax it|&s;elf.</P>
<P N="4">4. Some peculiar circum&s;tances of this country much contribute to make the payment of taxes practicable and ea&s;y. Tho&s;e places which have <HI>&s;uffered</HI> mo&s;t by the war, lie <HI>neare&s;t</HI> to the &s;eat of it, and of cour&s;e have the <HI>greate&s;t plenty</HI> of money, and have the benefit of the <HI>quicke&s;t de|mand</HI> and <HI>highe&s;t price</HI> for every thing they have for &s;ale, whil&s;t it happily falls out, that tho&s;e towns and counties that lie mo&s;t remote from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eat of the war, and have the greate&s;t &s;carcity of money, yet have been <HI>lea&s;t impo|veri&s;hed</HI> by the war, and are almo&s;t every one of them fine, grazing, fruitful countries, which produce great quantities of beef, mutton, and pork, which may be ea&s;ily conveyed to the army on foot, and thereby facilitate the payment of taxes and &s;upply of the army at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>Another favorable circum&s;tance is this, the enemy cannot &s;upply them&s;elves, e&s;pecially with tho&s;e articles we mo&s;t want, otherwi&s;e than by importing them; and as their ve&s;&s;els cannot always go under convoy, they often become a prey to our &s;hips of war and privateers, by which we gain a &s;up|ply of foreign nece&s;&s;aries, without contracting a foreign debt; tho&s;e concerned are enriched, the objects of trade are increa&s;ed, and the payment of taxes and &s;upply of the army greatly facilita<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed.</P>
<P>The benefits of this we have often experienced, and perhaps might increa&s;e them, if our crui&s;ing bu&s;ine&s;s was <HI>more properly conducted,</HI> and <HI>more liberally encouraged.</HI> Upon the whole matter, I beg leave to clo&s;e this E&s;&s;ay with a &s;hort view of the pre&s;ent &s;tate of our finances, then
<PB N="45" REF="023972_0052_0FC2BC962BDA6120">
to offer my propo&s;itions of trade and finance, and la&s;tly, point out the effects and operations which I conceive the&s;e will have on our trade, currency, and army.</P>
<P>I. Our pre&s;ent debt is <HI>what we o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> abroad, all our do|me&s;tic loans,</HI> and all the <HI>paper currency</HI> now in circulation, with enough more (if more is nece&s;&s;ary) to balance our public accounts.</P>
<P>II. The currency I rate at its pre&s;ent value; and admit|ting the nominal &s;um to be about 160,000,000 of dollars, the real value may be 8 or 9,000,000 of dollars, and which I conceive is not a larger &s;um than is at all times nece&s;&s;ary for a medium of trade in the Thirteen States.</P>
<P>III. The great intere&s;t of the&s;e States, I take to be, <HI>fix|ing</HI> the value of the currency, and preventing the <HI>further fluctuation</HI> of it, either by <HI>depreciation</HI> or <HI>appreciation;</HI> for I conceive the&s;e to be equally de&s;tructive, or if there is any difference, the latter is the wor&s;t of the two.&mdash;For this purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>IV. I think the <HI>further increa&s;e</HI> of the currency &s;hould be <HI>prevented,</HI> and the <HI>pre&s;&s;es &s;topped</HI> as &s;oon as may be, and this I think may take place on <HI>January</HI> next, nor do I &s;ee how it can be done &s;ooner. What the further fluctua|tion of the currency will be in the mean time, is uncer|tain; but the two mo&s;t powerful means I know of, to pre|vent the future depreciation, are, the <HI>heavy tax</HI> to be col|lected in this time, and <HI>taking off all re&s;traints from trade;</HI> if this la&s;t is not done, the &s;carcity of goods will be &s;o great, and the objects of trade &s;o few, that no wi&s;dom can prevent, or force &s;uppre&s;s, the exorbitant ri&s;e of goods before that time, e&s;pecially of &s;alt, rum, coffee, tea, and other articles of great con&s;umption, that have been <HI>limited much below</HI> the co&s;t and charges of importation.</P>
<P>V. I propo&s;e that a <HI>cour&s;e of taxes</HI> be in&s;tituted, to be paid monthly or quarterly, <HI>equal to the public expendi|tures.</HI></P>
<P>VI. When the pre&s;&s;es are &s;topped, and an effectual me|thod of &s;upplying the Trea&s;ury by taxes is well &s;ecured, the <HI>Continental money</HI> will in a &s;hort time make <HI>for it&s;elf an exchange,</HI> or gain a fixed value; it is impo&s;&s;ible now to &s;ay
<PB N="46" REF="023972_0053_0FC2BC97ACB16418">
what that value will be, but however it fixes, it will be right, and then I propo&s;e.</P>
<P>VII. To fix the exchange according to that value, by di|recting that <HI>hard money</HI> &s;hall be paid and received in the Trea&s;ury <HI>at that exchange,</HI> which will effectually prevent its appreciation; and if an adequate tax is well paid, the depreciation al&s;o will be effectually &s;topped: <HI>e. g.</HI> if the ex|change &s;hould be fixed at 20 for 1, and any per&s;on is di&s;|po&s;ed to pay his tax in hard money, let 1 dollar be receiv|ed in full for 20 paper ones, and let all payments be made from the Trea&s;ury by the &s;ame exchange.</P>
<P>But you will &s;ay, what is to <HI>become of the public faith?</HI> and I &s;ay, what <HI>is become of it already?</HI> I <HI>leave</HI> it where I <HI>found</HI> it, I do not make it any <HI>wor&s;e,</HI> but endeavour to pre|&s;erve it from <HI>further decays.</HI> If <HI>nineteen parts</HI> out of twen|ty are dead already, I am for pre&s;erving the <HI>twentieth part</HI> which remains alive; perhaps by good management and proper nur&s;ing, it may grow into full magnitude; but to effect this, it appears to me very nece&s;&s;ary to purge it of all tho&s;e deadly mixtures and bad adherents which have already brought it within an ace of total de&s;truction.</P>
<P>However this may be, I think it appears very plain, from what has been before advanced in this E&s;&s;ay, that continuing the dreadful mi&s;chiefs and injuries of a fluctu|ating currency for <HI>eighteen years</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Congre&s;s, about this time, publi&s;hed a &s;ort of funding &s;y&s;tem, in which, they propo&s;ed <HI>(and plighted the public faith with &s;olemnity enough too, for)</HI> the payment of the public debt in <HI>eighteen years.</HI></NOTE> to come, will no how atone for the wrongs, or compen&s;ate the damages, incur|red by that de&s;tructive delu&s;ion in four years pa&s;t, and I cannot conceive on what principles any man could wi&s;h to purcha&s;e &s;uch a deadly evil for many years to come, at the expen&s;e of heavy, galling taxes, almo&s;t as u&s;ele&s;s, difficult, and de&s;perate, as the rolling of <HI>Si&s;yphus'</HI>s &s;tone.</P>
<P>VIII. And for the &s;ame rea&s;on, <HI>all debts</HI> due from or to the Trea&s;ury, ought to be paid <HI>at the exchange</HI> which exi&s;ted at the <HI>time they were contracted;</HI> and therefore, I think it nece&s;&s;ary to form a <HI>table</HI> or <HI>rate</HI> of exchange, to be continued from the fir&s;t depreciation of Continental bills
<PB N="47" REF="023972_0054_0FC2BC992C3EB4B8">
up to the afore&s;aid period, when they &s;hall become of fix|ed value; and that all <HI>Loan-Office certificates</HI> be paid ac|cording to the <HI>exchange which exi&s;ted</HI> at the time in which the certificates were dated, and that all other debts be paid at <HI>the exchange</HI> which exi&s;ted when <HI>they were contract|ed,</HI> and all <HI>intere&s;t</HI> due ought to be paid at the <HI>&s;ame exchange</HI> as the <HI>debt</HI> out of which it grows.</P>
<P>This appears to me &s;o manife&s;tly ju&s;t and rea&s;onable, that I cannot think any objection can be made to it, and therefore to offer any arguments in &s;upport of it, would &s;eem to call into doubt the ju&s;tice of my country; I have only to ob&s;erve, that great judgment and accuracy will be required in forming tho&s;e rates of exchange, as any error in the&s;e would introduce an error into the adju&s;tment of all contracts for money, which yet remain un&s;ettled.</P>
<P N="9">9. The currency fixed as above, will be <HI>ju&s;t &s;ufficient</HI> for a medium of trade and <HI>no more,</HI> and if we can by firm and proper, &s;teady conduct, keep it fixed, it will an&s;wer all the ends of a medium of trade, without any inconveniency, for no one can &s;uppo&s;e it is of any con&s;equence, whether we e&s;timate a dollar at three pence, or &s;ix pence, or nine pence, or ninety pence, if it continues the &s;ame at all times, with no more variation than is ever incident to the nature of money.&mdash;Therefore</P>
<P N="10">10. There will be no immediate occa&s;ion for <HI>further taxes</HI> for &s;inking any part of the bills, which are or &s;hall be in circulation on the 1&s;t of <HI>January</HI> next, for no rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;igned why the country &s;hould be taxed to le&s;&s;en the quantity of money in circulation, when there is no more in being than is nece&s;&s;ary for a medium of trade.</P>
<P N="11">11. The method I propo&s;e will, by its natural operati|on, keep the <HI>army full of men</HI> and <HI>well &s;upplied,</HI> and we may be in good condition to carry on the war any length of time that may be nece&s;&s;ary, till it can be clo&s;ed by a &s;afe and honorable peace.</P>
<P N="12">12. And this method will al&s;o, by its natural operation, <HI>&s;ix our finances</HI> on the be&s;t and &s;ure&s;t footing that can be wi&s;hed, our currency will be <HI>as good as any on earth,</HI> and all the re&s;ources of a mo&s;t plentiful country will be proper|ly
<PB N="48" REF="023972_0055_0FC2BC9A9DBEC6D0">
and effectually opened for the u&s;e of the public, at what|ever time and to whatever amount the public exigence and nece&s;&s;ity may require.</P>
<P N="13">13. When the war &s;hall cea&s;e, it will leave us in a man|ner <HI>free of debt and little impoveri&s;hed;</HI> we may ea&s;ily, when the war is over, pay our foreign and dome&s;tic loans, and whenever we find it nece&s;&s;ary, &s;ink the whole current bills, all which may be done in a &s;hort time, and without any burdens &s;o heavy as to endanger the peace or pro&s;perity of the States. Every other &s;cheme which I have heard pro|po&s;ed, leaves us &s;ubject to two dreadful calamities: 1&s;t. The <HI>danger of &s;inking under the weight of the war.</HI> 2d. If we get through that, yet we &s;hall be left <HI>under &s;uch a load of debt,</HI> which mu&s;t be &s;unk by &s;uch long and galling taxes, as will almo&s;t make our <HI>lives a burden</HI> and our <HI>liberty a dear purcha&s;e,</HI> yea, the weight of the debt will <HI>abridge</HI> our liber|ty it&s;elf, for I know not how any per&s;ons or &s;tates can be called entirely free, who are deeply involved in debt beyond their pre&s;ent powers of payment.</P>
<P N="14">14. This method will be a good criterion by which we may <HI>di&s;tingui&s;h the Whigs from the Tories,</HI> this &s;cheme touches the pre&s;ent ca&s;h, it compels the pre&s;ent and actual contributions of every one to the great cau&s;e of <HI>American</HI> liberty, this will rou&s;e the feelings of every Tory, partly becau&s;e his pre&s;ent ca&s;h is called for, and partly becau&s;e it e&s;tabli&s;hes the &s;y&s;tem of liberty which he wi&s;hes to &s;ee de|&s;troyed. And as we have rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that much <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> gold is &s;pread among us, for the purpo&s;e of bribing our mo&s;t popular and able men, it will be of great con&s;e|quence to di&s;cover who they are that may be thus engaged to de&s;troy us, and as they probably will a&s;&s;ume the charac|ter of zealous Whigs, they cannot be better di&s;tingui&s;hed than by the temper in which they receive &s;uch propo&s;itions, as promi&s;e an effectual remedy of the mi&s;chiefs and dangers which mo&s;t threaten our de&s;truction, and at the &s;ame time bla&s;t the &s;ure&s;t hopes and confidence of our enemies.</P>
<P>Thus I have a &s;econd time given my thoughts, with the greate&s;t freedom, on the great &s;ubject of free trade and fi|nance, a &s;ubject perhaps as difficult and intricate as any
<PB N="49" REF="023972_0056_0FC2BCAB47CE0430">
whatever. A good <HI>financier</HI> is as rare as a <HI>phoenix,</HI> there is but here and there one appears in an age, yet in our pre|&s;ent circum&s;tances, a good financier is as nece&s;&s;ary as a ge|neral, for the one cannot be &s;upported without the other. I do not pretend to be equal to this great &s;ubject, I know I am not, but in the&s;e times of di&s;tre&s;s, every one ought to contribute what he can, and my fortunes are &s;o impaired by the depredations of the enemy, and my health and con|&s;titution &s;o broken by their in&s;ult and cruelty, that I have little left but &s;entiments and kind wi&s;hes to be&s;tow, and as the widow's mite was of great account in heaven, I hope my mite may be candidly received, as it is mo&s;t uprightly intended.</P>
<P>I know the <HI>limitation</HI> of trade, the doctrine of <HI>loans,</HI> and <HI>appreciation</HI> of our currency are ideas much favored by very many zealous people; my E&s;&s;ays are directly oppo&s;ed to them all, and I have only to &s;ay in excu&s;e, that I &s;hould not venture to face the cen&s;ure of &s;uch characters, if I were not really convinced of the high impropriety of all the three mentioned doctrines, and the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of adopting &s;entiments and mea&s;ures the mo&s;t <HI>oppo&s;ed</HI> to them.</P>
<P>It is with great pain I differ in &s;entiments from many gentlemen of &s;hining abilities, great experience, and mo&s;t undoubted integrity; and was the importance of the &s;ub|ject at the pre&s;ent cri&s;is le&s;s, I &s;hould not obtrude my thoughts on the public, nor have I the vanity to imagine that the feeble E&s;&s;ays of an ob&s;cure individual can correct the errors of a Continent; I only hope my publications may be &s;o far regarded, as to bring on a mo&s;t &s;erious in|quiry and thorough di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the weighty &s;ubject, by men of genius and abilities, equal to the mighty ta&s;k, that &s;o the real &s;ource of our calamities and their proper reme|dies may be di&s;covered, and the wi&s;e&s;t mea&s;ures may be adopted and pur&s;ued with diligence, &s;pirit, and deci&s;ion.</P>
<P>For however weak or ridiculous my E&s;&s;ays may be deem|ed, the &s;ubject of them will be acknowledged of &s;ufficient weight to engage the attention of the mo&s;t able and re&s;pec|table characters among us.&mdash;<HI>Si n&ocirc;&s;ti rect&uacute;is i&s;tis, candidus imperti, &s;i non, his utere mecum.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A THIRD ESSAY ON FREE TRADE and FINANCE.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">[Publi&s;hed in Philadelphia, January 8th, 1780.]</HEAD>
<P>CREDIT, either public or private, may always be kept good, where there is a &s;ufficient e&s;tate to &s;up|port it. Therefore, if private per&s;ons, a company of mer|chants, or a State, &s;uffer their credit to decay, when they have a &s;ufficient &s;tock to &s;upport it, their management mu&s;t be <HI>bad,</HI> but their affairs can never be <HI>de&s;perate</HI> &s;o long as their &s;tock or e&s;tate continues &s;ufficient to di&s;charge all demands on them; their <HI>bad management</HI> only need be cor|rected, and <HI>a good one</HI> adopted, and their affairs may be retrieved, and their credit re&s;tored. Therefore, the Thir|teen United States are not bankrupt, nor are their affairs de&s;perate, tho' their credit runs very low, and their fi|nances are in the wor&s;t condition. We have men enough for every purpo&s;e&mdash;We have provi&s;ions and &s;tores enough. Our hou&s;es, lands, and &s;tock on the lands, are little dimi|ni&s;hed, and in many places increa&s;ed, &s;ince the war began; yet our credit runs &s;o low, that it is with great difficulty &s;ufficient &s;upplies can be obtained.</P>
<P>The error lies in our <HI>finances,</HI> or <HI>management of the pub|lic &s;tock,</HI> and mu&s;t be mended, or we are ruined. In the
<PB N="51" REF="023972_0058_0FC2BCAE26B42460">
mid&s;t of full plenty we already &s;uffer the want of all things.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing nece&s;&s;ary to correcting an error, is to <HI>di&s;cover</HI> it, the next is to <HI>confe&s;s</HI> it, and the la&s;t to <HI>avoid</HI> it. Perhaps neither, of the&s;e three things are ea|&s;y in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. An error in finances, like a leak in a &s;hip, may be obvious in the <HI>fact,</HI> alarming in its <HI>effects,</HI> but difficult <HI>to find.</HI> The fact in view affords per|haps the &s;tronge&s;t proof of this. Our finances have, for five years pa&s;t, been under the management of fifty men, of the be&s;t abilities and mo&s;t &s;potle&s;s integrity, that could be elected out of the Thirteen States; yet they are in a ruined condition. We have &s;uffered <HI>more</HI> from this than from <HI>every other</HI> cau&s;e of calamity: it has killed <HI>more</HI> men, pervaded and corrupted the choice&s;t intere&s;ts of our coun|try <HI>more,</HI> and done <HI>more</HI> inju&s;tice, than even the arms and artifices of our enemies; &s;till the fatal error continues un|mended, and perhaps unexplored.</P>
<P>Our admiration and cen&s;ure will be greatly dimini&s;hed here, when we con&s;ider that the doctrine of finance, or the <HI>nature, effects,</HI> and <HI>operation</HI> of money may be placed among the mo&s;t <HI>ab&s;tru&s;e and intricate &s;ubjects,</HI> which we ever have occa&s;ion to examine. Not one in ten thou&s;and is capable of under&s;tanding it, and perhaps not one man in the world was ever complete ma&s;ter of it.</P>
<P>As a full proof of this, I adduce the many fruitle&s;s at|tempts to &s;top the depreciation of our currency, which have been adopted both in and out of Congre&s;s; all of which have failed of the expected &s;ucce&s;s, and many of them have greatly <HI>increa&s;ed</HI> the mi&s;chief they were intend|ed to <HI>remedy.</HI> The <HI>various &s;chemes</HI> and plans for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, which have been formed and propo&s;ed by many men of mo&s;t acknowledged abilities, warmly <HI>adopted</HI> by &s;ome, and as warmly <HI>oppo&s;ed</HI> by others, are a further proof of the great difficulty and ab&s;tru&s;e nature of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The univer&s;al <HI>di&s;tre&s;s</HI> of the country, ari&s;ing from this <HI>error</HI> in our finances, makes it a &s;ubject of the mo&s;t inter|e&s;ting importance, and the mo&s;t univer&s;al inquiry, yet the intellectual powers of the Continent, tho' wound up to
<PB N="52" REF="023972_0059_0FC2BCAFE6F8E9D8">
the highe&s;t pitch of attention, have not yet been able to find a remedy. The evil &s;till continues as unchecked as ever. It &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible to control or compute its force; it ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">les all calculation. Yet &s;o are we &s;ituated, and &s;o critical is the pre&s;ent moment, that a remedy mu&s;t be found, or we peri&s;h.</P>
<P>The <HI>morality</HI> and <HI>indu&s;try</HI> of our people are declining fa&s;t. <HI>Our laws</HI> become iniquitous, and the wor&s;t of all &s;in is that iniquity which <HI>is framed by a law,</HI> for it fixes the <HI>mi&s;chief</HI> in the very place where a <HI>remedy</HI> ought always to be &s;ought and found. The confidence of our people in the <HI>government</HI> is le&s;&s;ened, our <HI>army &s;uffers,</HI> and our <HI>credit</HI> and <HI>character abroad</HI> is in danger of contempt. All the&s;e, and no man can tell how many more, evils, hang like a thick cloud over us, the bur&s;ting of which will overwhelm us. But this is no time or place for declamation; a <HI>remedy</HI> is the thing to be &s;ought; a <HI>remedy</HI> or <HI>ruin</HI> are the only two alternatives before us.</P>
<P>I have twice e&s;&s;ayed to throw &s;ome light on this dark &s;ubject, with very little effect; my &s;y&s;tem, however &s;ome of its parts were approved, has not been adopted. My argu|ments, perhaps, were not thought conclu&s;ive, or were not &s;ufficiently clear, and therefore were little attended to; I will, neverthele&s;s, once more attempt to lay before the public, &s;ome principles and propo&s;itions which appear to me to have great weight, and which I &s;hall ground on fact as much as I can; for in this, as in natural philo&s;ophy, <HI>one experiment</HI> I conceive to be better, and &s;tronger proof than an <HI>hundred theorems.</HI></P>
<P>I. In every State where the occa&s;ions of money conti|nue unvaried, the <HI>incomes</HI> and <HI>expenditures</HI> ought to be kept equal, otherwi&s;e the <HI>value</HI> of money will <HI>fluctuate, i. e.</HI> in|crea&s;e or decrea&s;e; by which every money-contract, as well as all legacies, &s;alaries, fees of public offices, rents, &amp;c. will be altered, and the money, when paid, will be either more or le&s;s than was intended in the contract, in the law, &amp;c. In this ca&s;e, it matters little whether the increa&s;e of money proceeds from foreign loans or gifts, from opening mines, or pre&s;&s;es; an increa&s;e of money in any of the&s;e
<PB N="53" REF="023972_0060_0FC2BCC214D88858">
or any other way, will, with great inju&s;tice, alter the value of the payment, to the manife&s;t wrong and injury of the receiver; by which the law it&s;elf, as well as the contract or donation, becomes perverted and corrupted, and is made to enure contrary to the original intention of all the parties concerned; this is proved by very &s;ad experiment among our&s;elves.</P>
<P>Hence it appears from plain experiment, that any me|thod that tends to increa&s;e or decrea&s;e the quantity of cir|culating ca&s;h, will not prove a remedy, but will increa&s;e the evil, or run us into the contrary extreme, equally un|ju&s;t and mi&s;chievous, or perhaps more fatal. Hence it fol|lows, that our true remedy, mu&s;t, in the nature of the thing, lie, not <HI>in appreciating,</HI> more than <HI>in depreciating,</HI> the currency, but <HI>in fixing</HI> the value of it where it is, and keeping it &s;o fixed, that any man who makes a money-contract, may find, when the day of payment comes, that the money paid is ju&s;t the &s;ame as it was at the time of contract, that &s;o the money paid may exactly corre&s;pond with the intention of the contract, and be of cour&s;e a ju&s;t fulfilment of it without increa&s;e or decrea&s;e; which can|not po&s;&s;ibly happen where there is any fluctuation of its value between the times of contract and payment.</P>
<P>Hence, when the value of money is fixed and can be kept &s;o, it is in the <HI>mo&s;t perfect &s;tate</HI> its nature is capable of, and does, in the <HI>mo&s;t perfect manner,</HI> an&s;wer all the purpo&s;es and u&s;es which are de&s;ired or expected from it; for it is impo&s;&s;ible that money &s;hould exi&s;t in higher perfection, than when it is of &s;uch fixed and certain value that all other articles may be compared with it, and their value &s;afely e&s;timated from that compari&s;on.</P>
<P>Hence it follows clearly, that as far as money deviates from a fixed value, and becomes fluctuating, it lo&s;es its u&s;e, and becomes dangerous to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, and this will of cour&s;e, without any regard to its quantity, le&s;|&s;en its value, or increa&s;e its depreciation; and this may be a&s;&s;igned as one great cau&s;e of the pre&s;ent deprecia|tion of our currency beyond what its quantity would re|quire.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="023972_0061_0FC2BCC3EEA9CD00">
Hence it follows, that if money can obtain a fixed va|lue, it is of no manner of con&s;equence what the quantity is, for its value will ever fix at that rate or proportion to the occa&s;ions for money, which will make the one equal to the other, and of cour&s;e our Continental money will have ju&s;t the &s;ame u&s;e, if the value of it fixes at two pence the dollar, as at any other &s;um that can be named; but if that value of two pence is variable and like to be re|duced to a penny, every man would prefer two pence of fixed money to it; but if that value of two pence is fixed, it will be con&s;idered by every man ju&s;t as good, and no better than two pence of any other &s;ort of fixed money.</P>
<P>II. As the u&s;e and de&s;ign of money is to be a medium of all trade, it is nece&s;&s;ary that the <HI>demand for money</HI> &s;hould be at lea&s;t equal to the <HI>demand for every thing el&s;e</HI> which is to be bought or &s;old, for if there is one thing to be &s;old, which money will not purcha&s;e, the u&s;e of money is not &s;o great as it would be if it would buy every thing, and there|fore its value is &s;o far depreciated. Trade is carried on by the medium of money ea&s;ier than in any other way, and for that rea&s;on it was introduced. An over plenty or &s;carcity of money introduces barter, which takes away the u&s;e of money &s;o far as it extends, and con&s;equently depreciates it, and perhaps the great practice of <HI>bartering one &s;carce article for another,</HI> which has been introduced by the great plenty of money among us, may be a&s;&s;igned as one great cau&s;e of the depreciation of our currency beyond what the quantity would require.</P>
<P>Hence it follows that the only po&s;&s;ible way to re&s;tore our money to its true value and u&s;e, is to <HI>increa&s;e the demand</HI> for it; but this cannot be done by opening <HI>mines</HI> or <HI>pre&s;&s;es,</HI> by <HI>foreign loans</HI> or <HI>importations of money,</HI> but may be done by <HI>taxes,</HI> which make a demand for money all over the Thir|teen States, and from every taxable in it. In this every one is agreed. The only que&s;tion is, How far this demand is to be increa&s;ed? The an&s;wer is ea&s;y, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Till all &s;up|plies which we need can be purcha&s;ed for money, which will certainly be the ca&s;e, when the demand for money is &s;ufficiently great.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="023972_0062_0FC2BCC58D902B00">
This demand may be rai&s;ed at any time, and to any pitch we plea&s;e, by taxes; &s;o that the true and only po&s;&s;ible re|medy of the great mi&s;chief lies con&s;tantly <HI>in our power,</HI> and may be put in practice whenever <HI>we plea&s;e.</HI> But it mu&s;t be put into <HI>actual practice; talking</HI> about it, <HI>voting</HI> about it, making <HI>a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments</HI> and <HI>tax bills,</HI> will not do with|out an <HI>actual</HI> and <HI>&s;ea&s;onable collection and payment</HI> into the trea&s;ury.</P>
<P>That this may be done, &s;o as to give a fixed and e&s;ta|bli&s;hed permanancy to our currency; and thereby &s;ave the States, and at the &s;ame time relieve every individual from the danger, damage, and anxiety he now &s;uffers from the deficiency of our currency; and avoid oppre&s;&s;ion of indivi|duals, and thereby put an end to all unea&s;ine&s;&s;es in the go|vernment: that this may be done, I &s;ay, the &s;everal things following mu&s;t be &s;trictly attended to.</P>
<P N="1">1. That the taxation be <HI>fair and equitable,</HI> &s;o as to bring the burden equally or in due proportion on each State, and on the <HI>individuals</HI> of each State. The fir&s;t is the bu&s;ine&s;s of Congre&s;s, the &s;econd of every particular State. As to the fir&s;t, it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that there be an e&s;timate made of the abilities of each State, on which the quotas are to be grounded; and this I think cannot be done bet|ter than by making the <HI>number of &s;ouls</HI> in each State the rule of it.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It is to be ob&s;erved here that it was not the practice of Congre&s;s un|der the old confederation, to in&s;titute taxes by any direct acts of their own, but they calculated the &s;ums wanted, and made requi&s;itions of them from the &s;everal States, in &s;uch proportions or quotas as were made <HI>pro re nata,</HI> as no e&s;tabli&s;hed quotas, or rules of forming them, were &s;ettled. There was much conver&s;ation about this time and many debates in Congre&s;s, concern|ing the rule or principle on which the e&s;timates of the quotas of each State &s;hould be fixed; and &s;undry modes of this e&s;timation were adopted by Con|gre&s;s, with various alterations and amendments, till at la&s;t the long debated matter was &s;ettled by the new Con&s;titution (article I.) on the principle here propo&s;ed, with a &s;mall variation re&s;pecting Negroes and Indians.</P>
<P><HI>N.

<P N="2"><PB N="56" REF="023972_0063_0FC2BCD2463825D8">
2. It is further ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, that the <HI>quotas</HI> of each State be e&s;timated <HI>in hard money,</HI> payable in Conti|nental money <HI>at the exchange</HI> which exi&s;ts in each particu|lar State at the time they pay their tax into the Continental Trea&s;ury: hard money is a fixed &s;tandard of value, and can never vary much here from its value in <HI>Europe,</HI> and there|fore fixing the quotas by this &s;tandard, will prevent any ir|regularities which will ari&s;e from depreciation of our cur|rency between the time of the <HI>demand</HI> of the quotas, and the time of <HI>payment</HI> by each State; without this the depreci|ation might afford an inducement, tho' a <HI>very wicked one,</HI> to &s;ome States, to make their <HI>collections and payments dila|tory,</HI> for there would be an advantage in delaying payment of taxes, as well as of every other debt, if the &s;um &s;hould <HI>le&s;&s;en</HI> every day, and it has been found in fact, tho' little to the honor of the tardy States, that <HI>&s;ome States</HI> have paid their quotas, when the exchange was <HI>four to one,</HI> whil&s;t <HI>others</HI> have paid their quotas of the &s;ame tax at the ex|change of <HI>twenty for one, i. e.</HI> ju&s;t one fifth part of the ju&s;t debt.</P>
<P>I &s;aid that the payments ought to be made at the ex|change that &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in the State that pays the money, at the time of payment, for all &s;upplies which are purcha&s;ed for the u&s;e of the public in that State, are purcha&s;ed at that exchange, and therefore it is rea&s;onable that their quotas of taxes &s;hould be paid at the &s;ame exchange, whether it be higher or lower than that which exi&s;ts in the other States at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, if the quotas demanded of each State be not made in fixed money, it is not at all certain they will be &s;ufficient when paid; for if the e&s;timates of expenditures were made in money at twenty for one, and the tax de|manded be made out accordingly, it is very certain if it &s;hould be paid at forty for one, it would not &s;atisfy more than half the e&s;timate, and therefore mu&s;t be deficient by one half, and the work is all to do over again to get the other half collected and paid, be&s;ides all the dangers and damages which may ari&s;e from the delay.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="023972_0064_0FC2BCDB37149DD0">
Nor do I &s;ee that any rea&s;onable objection could be made to the ju&s;tice of <HI>crediting</HI> the States for their pa&s;t payments <HI>by the &s;ame rule;</HI> for it is &s;urely wrong that a dilatory State that has really paid but one fifth part of the value of her quota, &s;hould have credit for the whole: but whatever may be thought proper with re&s;pect to the time <HI>pa&s;t,</HI> I think there can be no doubt that &s;uch &s;candalous and dan|gerous mi&s;chiefs &s;hould be well guarded again&s;t in <HI>time to come.</HI> To all this it ought to be further added, that when any State delays to collect their taxes, the money will ac|cumulate, and con&s;equently depreciate fa&s;ter in it than in other States where the tax is quickly collected; and no rea&s;on can be given, why any State &s;hould take advantage of that depreciation which their own iniquitous delay has occa&s;ioned.</P>
<P>It is further nece&s;&s;ary that each delinquent State &s;hould be charged with <HI>the intere&s;t</HI> of all &s;uch parts of their &s;everal quotas which &s;hall be unpaid at the time pre&s;cribed by Con|gre&s;s, till payment be made; and for the &s;ame rea&s;on they &s;hould be allowed intere&s;t on all &s;uch &s;ums as may be paid before the &s;aid time of payment, till &s;uch time of payment comes; and if all this, together with the honor and zeal of the &s;everal States, &s;hould be in&s;ufficient to prevent <HI>defi|ciencies,</HI> further methods &s;hould be adopted and effectually executed, till &s;uch deficiencies &s;hall be prevented; for the very idea of &s;upporting the union, dignity, public faith, and even &s;afety of the Thirteen States, without <HI>good punctu|ality</HI> in each State, is mo&s;t manife&s;tly chimerical, vain, and ridiculous; for there can never be any <HI>confidence</HI> placed in our admini&s;tration, if their <HI>coun&s;els, covenants, and mea|&s;ures,</HI> mu&s;t be ever liable to be rendered fruitle&s;s or im|practicable by the deficiencies of one or two of tho&s;e States.</P>
<P N="3">3. On the part of the particular States, it is nece&s;&s;ary that each of them at the beginning of each year &s;hould have a li&s;t or a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment of all taxables completed, and all appeals adju&s;ted, and good collectors appointed, that as &s;oon as any tax is granted by their Legi&s;lature, it may be put im|mediately into the collectors' hands, and the collection be fini&s;hed and the money paid into the Continental Trea&s;ury,
<PB N="58" REF="023972_0065_0FC2BCDCB7797E08">
without lo&s;s of time. If matters were once put into this train, any nece&s;&s;ary &s;um demanded by Congre&s;s might be collected, and ready for u&s;e in a very &s;hort time; and this will fully obviate the great objection, that taxes, tho' ac|knowledged to be the only &s;ure and final remedy, are yet too &s;low in their operation to be depended on.</P>
<P>It appears from this view, that taxes are a much more <HI>certain and &s;peedy</HI> &s;upply, and may be depended on with much greater &s;afety than any other method which has been pointed out to me, and they are a final, <HI>a fini&s;hed remedy;</HI> whereas loans, lotteries, annuities, and every other method which I have heard of, are no more than temporary expe|dients, are but plau&s;ible anticipations of our revenue, and all look forward to a burden to be impo&s;ed in future time, which had better be borne now, and be finally done with.</P>
<P>And as I propo&s;e that all the e&s;timates of Congre&s;s, and all the quotas demanded of the States, &s;hould be made out in hard money, &s;o I al&s;o propo&s;e that the taxes may be made out in the &s;ame money, payable either in hard mo|ney or Continental, at the option of the per&s;on who pays the tax. Sundry material advantages I conceive will ari&s;e from this:</P>
<P N="1">1. Many per&s;ons out of trade have no money but hard, and when called on for the tax, may be compelled to part with their hard money, at an unrea&s;onable exchange, which will be avoided if hard money it&s;elf will pay the tax.</P>
<P N="2">2. This will pre&s;erve the tax from any po&s;&s;ibility of fluc|tuation, by the depreciation or appreciation of the curren|cy, for if any per&s;on thinks the exchange demanded unrea|&s;onable, he may pay it in hard money, and then he is &s;ure not to pay either too much or too little.</P>
<P N="3">3. This will gradually bring &s;ums of hard money, per|haps not incon&s;iderable, into the Continental Trea&s;ury, which may be &s;o u&s;ed as to prevent drawing on <HI>Europe,</HI> and thereby increa&s;ing our foreign debt, which I conceive an object greatly worth attention.</P>
<P N="4">4. This will exhibit the tax to view in its real value, and prevent the terrors which may ari&s;e from the enormous found in Continental money.</P>

5. This would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">atly tend in a &s;hort cour&s;e of time to reduce all our p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">te contracts to the fixed &s;tandard of hard money, by which we &s;hould avoid that vortex of fluc|tuation and uncertainty, which has rendered all our private dealings precarious, and made even our profits rather the effect of chance, than of wi&s;e calculation and indu&s;try. Nor do I think that this would at all prejudice the real u&s;e of the Continental money, for it would &s;till pa&s;s at its exchange or value.</P>
<P>Indeed I do not &s;ee that the depreciation of the money would have been in it&s;elf a calamity half &s;o ruinous as it has proved, if it had <HI>operated only on the ca&s;h in being;</HI> it would have been a tax upon every po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of it, and would have le&s;&s;ened the public debt, for it is manife&s;t that the public debt at the exchange of forty for one, is but half what it was when the exchange was twenty for one; and as that money was perhaps as equally diffu&s;ed over the Thirteen States, as any other property, the tax might have operated with a tolerable degree of ju&s;tice; but the ca&s;e was altered when the depreciation was not confined to the Continental money only, but drew every thing el&s;e after it: when it came to operate on <HI>every debt and money-contract,</HI> on every <HI>legacy, &s;alary, public fee</HI> and <HI>fine,</HI> yea, on the <HI>fi|nances</HI> of the States, &s;o as to de&s;troy all <HI>calculation of both &s;upplies and expenditures,</HI> the mi&s;chief became infinite: we were both in our private affairs and public councils, thrown into confu&s;ion inextricable.</P>
<P>New objects, new effects, &s;tarted up to view in every quarter, which no <HI>di&s;cernment</HI> could fore&s;ee, nor <HI>wi&s;dom</HI> ob|viate, and like an inchantment of fairy vi&s;ions, bewildered us all in &s;uch a maze of errors, interwoven with &s;uch &s;ub|tilty into every branch of our movements, that no one de|partment was free of them; and we all &s;tand trembling this moment before this mon&s;ter of depreciation, like bewilder|ed travellers in a giant's ca&s;tle, where the <HI>bones</HI> of broken fortunes are every where in &s;ight, with the <HI>&s;pectres of wi|dows and fatherle&s;s,</HI> and a thou&s;and others, which the mon|&s;ter has devoured, and <HI>is &s;till</HI> devouring as greedy as ever.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="023972_0067_0FC2BCDFD4FA77D8">
This mi&s;chief will be greatly le&s;&s;ened, if, by reducing all our debts and demands, public and private, to the &s;tand|ard of hard money, we can confine the depreciation of the money to it&s;elf, and prevent its operation on all other money-contracts and &s;ecurities, and this will, in my opi|nion, greatly tend to cure the depreciation it&s;elf, becau&s;e in that ca&s;e no man can gain any thing by the deprecia|tion, but every man who has any ca&s;h mu&s;t lo&s;e by it; and when private intere&s;t is brought into a coincidence with the public good, they will greatly help each other.</P>
<P>But be all this as it may, let us not lo&s;e &s;ight of the principal argument, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that no project or &s;cheme to &s;top the depreciation can have the de&s;ired effect, if it does not <HI>increa&s;e the demand</HI> for our currency; and on the contrary, any &s;cheme whatever that will increa&s;e the demand for our currency, will <HI>le&s;&s;en or check the depreciation.</HI> Hence we &s;ee how vain all propo&s;itions mu&s;t be, which, by their natural operation, will increa&s;e ca&s;h among us, and thereby le&s;&s;en the demand for it, or increa&s;e the national debt beyond all probability of payment, and thereby le&s;&s;en the public cre|dit, and of cour&s;e le&s;&s;en al&s;o the demand for the currency which depends on it.

of taxes may be made more quick and more &s;ure, than in any other I know of. This is dealing in <HI>realities.</HI> We have dealt in <HI>&s;hadows and delu&s;ions</HI> too long already for our <HI>honor,</HI> too long for our <HI>&s;afety.</HI> It is not only wicked, di&s;|honorable, and dangerous, but it is weak and ab&s;urd, to &s;uppo&s;e that we can any longer produce our public &s;upplies out of &s;hadows and vi&s;ionary projects; the ba&s;ele&s;s fabric will vani&s;h; our re&s;ources con&s;i&s;t in <HI>real &s;ub&s;tance</HI> only, and from thence alone can our &s;upplies be produced, and let them be collected by an equable tax, and the burden on the public will not be any thing near &s;o heavy and ruinous, as the numberle&s;s mi&s;chiefs of the depreciation have proved for four years pa&s;t.</P>
<P>But it may be a&s;ked, What is to be done in the pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s? How are our pre&s;ent, immediate wants to be re|lieved? The an&s;wer mu&s;t lie in a pretty narrow compa&s;s. I know of but three things that can be done in the ca&s;e: 1. To <HI>borrow money,</HI> which is fatal in its operation, and uncertain in its effects. 2. To &s;et the <HI>pre&s;&s;es</HI> a going again, which will not only increa&s;e the mi&s;chief, but de&s;troy the operation of any remedy. Or, 3. do without &s;upplies awhile. If the crows cannot be killed, nor the carca&s;s be removed out of their reach, the &s;ure way is to let them eat it all up to the very bones, and then they will go away of their own accord; and this is better than to have <HI>Tityus'</HI>s vulture for ever gnawing on our liver, and our liver grow|ing at the &s;ame time as fa&s;t as he eats it. Here is indeed a notable difficulty which would vani&s;h into nothing, if there was a proper connexion formed between the <HI>great re|&s;ources</HI> of the Thirteen States, the real &s;ub&s;tance, the mighty wealth which they contain, and <HI>the credit of the States,</HI> nece&s;&s;ary to collect them, and bring them to public u&s;e, when the public &s;afety or convenience requires them. The credit of our currrency is too lax, too enervated, and feeble for this; people have more of it already than they have u&s;e for, and the depreciation makes it a dangerous ar|ticle to keep on hand: it is like peri&s;hable goods, which are lo&s;t in the keeping. In the nature of the thing there is nor can be no remedy for this, but increa&s;ing the de|mands
<PB N="62" REF="023972_0069_0FC2BCF1B482E2E8">
for the currency, and this can be done in no other way than by an univer&s;al tax, which alone can create an univer&s;al demand, and this demand mu&s;t operate on tho&s;e per&s;ons who have the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies, &s;o as to make their nece&s;&s;ity for money equal to the nece&s;&s;ity of the pur|cha&s;er of the &s;upplies.</P>
<P>This will put the contracting parties on a par of equal nece&s;&s;ity on each &s;ide, which alone can ever produce an equal bargain, and is the real, natural &s;ource of all trade.

Let a per&s;on who is under nece&s;&s;ity of an article, apply to one who has it, but is under no nece&s;&s;ity to &s;ell it, he mu&s;t give any price that is a&s;ked. Let a man who is under nece&s;&s;ity of &s;elling an article, apply to one to purcha&s;e, who is under no nece&s;&s;ity of buying, he mu&s;t take what is offered. This may be thought a refine|ment of argument, but I appeal to every man, the lea&s;t or the mo&s;t ver&s;ed in trade, if this is not the univer&s;al principle of all trade, and if it is not the univer&s;al practice of all wi&s;e traders, if they are under a nece&s;&s;ity of buying or &s;elling, to conceal that nece&s;&s;ity as far as they can, le&s;t it &s;hould put them under di&s;advantage in making their bar|gain.</P>
<P>It is further to be ob&s;erved, that an increa&s;ed demand for money is the only thing which will naturally excite great diligence and pains in procuring &s;uch articles as will bring it; therefore, it appears that this is the only true means of re&s;toring the <HI>decayed indu&s;try</HI> of our people, with|out which we &s;hall &s;oon have no &s;upplies rai&s;ed, and then we mu&s;t be de&s;titute indeed, for no demand for money can produce &s;upplies which are not in exi&s;tence, which to

<P>I <HI>abhor</HI> and <HI>execrate</HI> every idea of a <HI>foreign loan</HI> to pur|cha&s;e nece&s;&s;aries produced among our&s;elves; it may be ne|ce&s;&s;ary to borrow in <HI>Europe</HI> money &s;ufficient to purcha&s;e what we mu&s;t export from thence, and enough to make former contracts punctually and hone&s;tly good; but to bor|row money in <HI>Europe</HI> to pay for &s;upplies produced here among our&s;elves, appears to me the height of ab&s;urdity: this expo&s;es our weakne&s;s to all the world; not our <HI>weak|ne&s;s</HI> in point of <HI>&s;upplies;</HI> not the exhau&s;ted &s;tate of our country, for that is full of every thing we want, clothing and military &s;tores excepted; but the weakne&s;s of our <HI>coun&s;els</HI> and <HI>admini&s;tration,</HI> that our <HI>dome&s;tic economy</HI> &s;hould be &s;o bad, that we &s;hould not be able to call into public u&s;e the very &s;upplies in which the country abounds, is <HI>&s;hameful:</HI> &s;uch an imbecility of coun&s;els, I imagine, will hold us up in &s;o very contemptible a light in <HI>Europe</HI> as will effectually de&s;troy all our <HI>credit there,</HI> and thereby put it out of our power to <HI>de&s;troy our&s;elves;</HI> but if this &s;hould not be the ca&s;e, I do not &s;ee but our independence, with all the ble&s;&s;ings re&s;ulting from it, is in danger: for I really fear that &s;ome among us would, without concern, mortgage the Thirteen States up to the value of every acre they con|tain, to any foreign power that will tru&s;t us.</P>
<P>It is as nece&s;&s;ary that we pre&s;erve our&s;elves independent of <HI>France, Spain,</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> as of <HI>England.</HI> It is ma|nife&s;t beyond any need of proof, that the nation who is in debt to a &s;uperior power, cannot be free and independent, but is ever liable to demands the mo&s;t in&s;ulting and incon|&s;i&s;tent with freedom and &s;afery.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="023972_0071_0FC2BCF4C2DA4D08">
But if after all, nothing can &s;top the career of this fatal mea&s;ure of contracting a further foreign debt, I beg, at lea&s;t, that the monies nece&s;&s;ary be borrowed at home on yearly intere&s;t, payable in bills on <HI>Europe,</HI> or in hard money at home, and let the delinquent States be charged with this intere&s;t, for if there was no delinquency, there would be no need of a loan: my rea&s;ons are,</P>
<P N="1">1. If intere&s;t of hard money or bills mu&s;t be paid, I think it better that our own people &s;hould have it than &s;trangers, that the yearly profits of the loan &s;hould lie among our&s;elves, and not go out of the country, never to return.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is le&s;s dangerous to contract a foreign debt, &s;uffici|ent for the yearly intere&s;t of this loan, than for the princi|pal and intere&s;t too.</P>
<P N="3">3. This method will have one ab&s;urdity le&s;s than the other, for if bills are to i&s;&s;ue for the money to be loaned in <HI>Europe</HI> (for our nece&s;&s;ities are &s;o pre&s;&s;ing, it is &s;aid we cannot wait till the advices arrive that the loan is com|pleted) they mu&s;t be drawn on funds of mere imagination, for not one &s;hilling of the fund on which they are to be drawn, is yet procured, nor do we know that the loan can be obtained at all; and therefore every bill is liable to come back prote&s;ted, to the utter ruin, and mo&s;t laughable con|tempt of the credit of the States. And</P>
<P N="4">4. The uncertainty of the payment of the bills will cer|tainly operate on the &s;ale of them. I believe nobody ex|pects they can be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">old at a lo&s;s of le&s;s than 20 or 30 per cent. The pre&s;ent exchange of the currency is 40 to 1; but I have not heard any body propo&s;e &s;elling the bills at more than 30 for 1.</P>
<P N="5">5. The very idea of drawing bills or loaning at a lo&s;s of 20, 30, or 40 per cent. appears to me &s;o very ruinous and ab&s;urd, and the fact &s;tands in &s;o glaring and &s;triking a light, that I do not know how to form one argument for the conviction of &s;uch as are willing to adopt either. The great, &s;ure, and only &s;upply of all our wants, and remedy of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> di&s;tre&s;s, lies in taxes. Ju&s;tice requires that this re|medy &s;hould be effectually adopted: public burdens ought
<PB N="65" REF="023972_0072_0FC2BCF642341A28">
to re&s;t in due proportion on all, which can be effected in no other way. This alone will create an univer&s;al demand for our currency, and bring it into &s;uch repute, that every nece&s;&s;ary article in the country may be readily purcha&s;ed with it; this &s;ettles and fini&s;hes the matter as we go, and relieves us at once from the anxious terrors of an un&s;up|portable debt, and all future demands and in&s;ults from any power on earth.</P>
<P>Say, <HI>Americans,</HI> if this freedom and independence, for which you have bled and nobly dared every danger, and for which you have &s;et at defiance, and incurred the ven|geance of, the mighte&s;t power on earth, is not &s;till worth your mo&s;t capital attention: it avails little to <HI>change our ma&s;ters;</HI> to have <HI>none</HI> is our object, which can never be our ca&s;e, if we are in debt to foreign powers.</P>
<P>III. I beg leave here to propo&s;e one thing more, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> to <HI>take off every re&s;traint from our trade.</HI> Let every man be at liberty to get money as fa&s;t as he can; and let the public call for it as fa&s;t as the public exigence requires. Limita|tions of our trade have been &s;o often tried, &s;o &s;trongly en|forced, and have &s;o con&s;tantly failed of the intended effect, and have, in every in&s;tance, produced &s;o much inju&s;tice and oppre&s;&s;ion in our dealings, and excited &s;o many quar|rels, &s;o much ill-will and chagrin among our people, that they have, in every in&s;tance, after &s;ome time of mo&s;t per|nicious continuance, been laid a&s;ide by a kind of general con&s;ent, and even mo&s;t of their advocates have been con|vinced of their hurtful tendency, as well as utter impracti|cability.</P>
<P>As experiment is the &s;ure&s;t proof of the natural effects of all &s;peculations of this kind, and as this proof of fact has ever appeared in the &s;tronge&s;t manner, again&s;t the practicability and &s;ucce&s;s of all re&s;traints of this &s;ort, and as every &s;eeming, temporary advantage that has re&s;ulted from them, has con&s;tantly been followed by effects &s;o very pernicious and alarming, it is <HI>&s;trange,</HI> it is <HI>marvellous</HI> to me, that any per&s;on of common di&s;cernment, who has been acquainted with all the above-mentioned trials and
<PB N="66" REF="023972_0073_0FC2BD0034F1F098">
effects, &s;hould entertain any idea of the expediency of try|ing any &s;uch method again.</P>
<P>Not le&s;s ab&s;urd &s;hould I conceive a number of adepts in <HI>Barclay'</HI>s &s;y&s;tem of ideas, driving their heads ten times go|ing again&s;t a wall, and &s;till preparing to try it again with greater force than before, becau&s;e they could not believe there was the <HI>&s;ub&s;tance</HI> of a wall, but an <HI>idea</HI> only there; equally in both ca&s;es mu&s;t the career of the zealots be &s;top|ped in hard fact, and their &s;kulls, if not exceeding thick, mu&s;t be greatly wounded.</P>
<P>Liberty and property are the mo&s;t tender intere&s;ts of mankind; any kind of abridgment, re&s;traint, or control of the&s;e is ever &s;en&s;ibly felt and borne with impatience; and the natural cour&s;e of things &s;eems &s;o adapted to tho&s;e two great and favorite rights, that any violations of them will, by their mo&s;t natural operation, produce effects very un&s;a|lutary, if not fatal. Indeed, this mi&s;chief may at any time be increa&s;ed till the effects are tragical. Trade, if let alone, will ever make its own way be&s;t, and, like an irre|&s;i&s;tible river, will ever run &s;afe&s;t, do lea&s;t mi&s;chief and mo&s;t good, when &s;uffered to run without ob&s;truction in its own natural channel.</P>
<P>IV. I humbly propo&s;e further, that <HI>no private property may ever be taken for public u&s;e, again&s;t the con&s;ent of the owner, without the mo&s;t manife&s;t nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> and in that ca&s;e, not without paying the <HI>full value.</HI> If the public wants any man's property, they are certainly better able to pay for it, than an individual is to lo&s;e it. Paying half or any thing le&s;s than the whole value, is a &s;curvy and eva&s;ive way of robbing the owner, and infinitely unworthy of the ju&s;tice and dignity of a State. There has been &s;o much of this iniquity committed either with or without pretext of Law, that it has been really dangerous for a man to po&s;&s;e&s;s an article of capital demand; he has been in danger of hav|ing the article torn from him, not only without due pay|ment, but with in&s;ult and abu&s;e; and this wicked and &s;hameful practice has really di&s;couraged many per&s;ons of great ability and indu&s;try, from procuring articles of great demand, le&s;t they &s;hould be thereby &s;ubjected to the mor|tification
<PB N="67" REF="023972_0074_0FC2BD09792DA648">
of having them torn away with violence and di&s;|grace.</P>
<P>Many great nece&s;&s;aries have been rendered &s;carce by the&s;e means, and thereby the price has become enormous, and the procurement difficult. In&s;tances in flour, &s;alt, &amp;c. are mo&s;t notorious and obvious. This greatly de&s;troys the confidence of the holders of the great nece&s;&s;aries, in the officers of government, and le&s;&s;ens their a&s;&s;iduity and zeal in procuring or bringing their goods to the public &s;tores. The con&s;equences of this &s;hameful iniquity are mo&s;t fatal in their nature, and tho' &s;low and not immediately percep|tible, yet mo&s;t certain in their operation, and mo&s;t &s;ure of effects.</P>
<P>V. I propo&s;e further that there be the greate&s;t care and attention in the <HI>appointment of the men</HI> who are to fill all <HI>places</HI> of public tru&s;t, and e&s;pecially &s;uch as are employed in the <HI>revenue</HI> and <HI>expenditures</HI> of the public monies and &s;upplies. I &s;hould conceive the following qualifications &s;o nece&s;&s;ary as to admit of no di&s;pen&s;ation:</P>
<P N="1">1. That the candidate for any place of public tru&s;t have &s;ufficient <HI>knowledge and ability</HI> to di&s;charge the duties of the office propo&s;ed for him. A public officer, like St. <HI>Paul'</HI>s bi&s;hop, ought to be a workman that needs not to be a&s;ham|ed. But I am &s;ure any <HI>per&s;on needs to be a&s;hamed,</HI> who ap|pears in a public office without under&s;tanding the <HI>duties of it,</HI> and therefore utterly incapable of di&s;charging them pro|perly: and the <HI>per&s;ons who appointed</HI> him ought to be a&s;ham|ed of him too, and he certainly will prove a <HI>&s;hame to the public;</HI> for the public, <HI>i. e.</HI> a kingdom, a &s;tate, a country, or a city, always &s;hine thro' the medium of their <HI>public men;</HI> if they mean to have their weight, dignity, charac|ter, and intere&s;t well &s;upported in a treaty, a Congre&s;s, a General A&s;&s;embly, or a Court of Ju&s;tice, they mu&s;t ap|point <HI>&s;ufficient men</HI> to repre&s;ent them and act for them; if they would have their mo&s;t public and important coun&s;els, their laws, the admini&s;tration of public ju&s;tice and ci|vil policy, or their revenue <HI>well conducted,</HI> they mu&s;t ap|point <HI>men of knowledge</HI> ane <HI>abilities</HI> &s;ufficient for the&s;e great purpo&s;es, to conduct them; the&s;e are all objects of &s;uch
<PB N="68" REF="023972_0075_0FC2BD0A96BB9868">
magnitude, &s;uch general importance, and pervade with &s;uch &s;ubtilty every intere&s;t of the community, that they reach and deeply affect every individual, and pre&s;cribe the degree of &s;ecurity, honor, and peace which he is to en|joy.</P>
<P>How mad and execrable then mu&s;t be that elector, or per&s;on concerned in the appointment of a public officer, who, from motives of party, per&s;onal friend&s;hip, or any wor&s;e inducement, will give his vote for a per&s;on, who, he knows, is deficient in the knowledge and abilities requi&s;ite to the proper di&s;charge of the office? Let a man's virtue and integrity be never &s;o great, if he wants knowledge and ability, he never can &s;hine, he never can &s;erve with honor or advantage in the office, but mu&s;t be a &s;hame to him&s;elf and to his con&s;tituents, and mo&s;t probably a damage, and may be a ruin into the bargain. But</P>
<P N="2">2. Knowledge and abilities, tho' e&s;&s;ential, are not the only requi&s;ites in a public man; <HI>integrity and prudence</HI> are al&s;o mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary. The true character of the heart can|not be certainly known indeed, but is be&s;t judged of by his general deportment; therefore the character which a man obtains among his neighbours, and tho&s;e who be&s;t know him, is the &s;ure&s;t rule by which he can be e&s;timated, and will be mo&s;t likely to pre-engage the public confidence in his favor; and it is nece&s;&s;ary, not only that a public man &s;hould be upright, but al&s;o that he &s;hould be generally e&s;teemed &s;o. The wife of <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> ought not to be &s;u&s;pect|ed; therefore it mu&s;t be the height of folly (to &s;ay no wor&s;e) to appoint a man to public &s;tation, who&s;e private character for integrity and prudence is not good.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Sound judgment and rational di&s;cretion</HI> is a mo&s;t e&s;&s;en|tial part of nece&s;&s;ary character <HI>in a public man,</HI> e&s;pecially one who is concerned in the public councils, or important offices of any &s;ort. Nothing can &s;carcely be conceived more dangerous to the public, than to have its great ar|rangements &s;ubject to the influence of a man of <HI>wild pro|jection, and extravagant conceits;</HI> &s;uch a per&s;on, e&s;pecially if he has a good addre&s;s and copious invention, is enough to <HI>make errors fa&s;ter</HI> than twenty men of the be&s;t wi&s;dom
<PB N="69" REF="023972_0076_0FC2BD1957621198">
can <HI>mend.</HI> It is not &s;trange, to find men, who have great talents at di&s;covering valuable mines, who, at the &s;ame time, have no knowledge in e&s;&s;aying the ore, or making the proper u&s;e of it. But to come more immediately to the point in view,</P>
<P N="4">4. In the appointment of an officer of the revenue, or expenditures of the public monies, <HI>i. e.</HI> one through who&s;e hands the public monies or &s;upplies are to pa&s;s, it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary, mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary, that he &s;hould be a man of known <HI>indu&s;try, economy, and thriftine&s;s in his own pri|vate affairs.</HI> If a man's <HI>regard to his own character, fortune, and family,</HI> is not a &s;ufficient inducement to make him <HI>care|ful, indu&s;trious,</HI> and <HI>thrifty</HI> in his own affairs, it is not to be pre&s;umed, that any regard he may have to the public <HI>can make</HI> him &s;o; a man's own intere&s;t always lies neare&s;t his heart, <HI>i. e.</HI> &s;elf-love is the &s;tronge&s;t of all pa&s;&s;ions and mo|tives. It was hardly ever known, that rai&s;ing a man into public office, <HI>mended his private vices,</HI> but <HI>they</HI> mo&s;t com|monly like a pervading poi&s;on, get incorporated into the department, in which he officiates, and greatly corrupt and injure the admini&s;tration of it.</P>
<P>Therefore to appoint a <HI>bankrupt,</HI> a man of <HI>di&s;&s;ipation, idlene&s;s,</HI> and <HI>prodigality,</HI> to an office, through which the public <HI>monies</HI> and <HI>&s;upplies</HI> are to pa&s;s, is a &s;ure way to have them <HI>wa&s;ted</HI> or <HI>purloined,</HI> in which the riches, &s;trength, and blood of the States are exhau&s;ted; not to an&s;wer <HI>the great ends</HI> of government, the <HI>&s;afety, &s;ecurity,</HI> and <HI>peace</HI> of the great whole, but to gratify the <HI>extravagance, di&s;&s;ipation,</HI> and <HI>debauchery</HI> of an individual; it would be much better, if a man has &s;uch a friend, that mu&s;t be &s;erved, to <HI>give him a few thou&s;ands,</HI> to &s;pend in his own way, than to admit him into the important <HI>offices of revenue,</HI> and thereby cor|rupt its cour&s;e and u&s;e.</P>
<P>Perhaps &s;ome errors of this &s;ort may have occa&s;ioned a profu&s;ion of expen&s;e, a neglect and lo&s;s of public &s;tores, and a failure of di&s;tribution, all which tend to increa&s;e our di&s;tre&s;s, and accelerate the decays of our finances; for as in private affairs, <HI>prudence</HI> in expen&s;e is as nece&s;&s;ary to a fortune as the <HI>acquirement of money,</HI> &s;o in our public admi|ni&s;tration,
<PB N="70" REF="023972_0077_0FC2BD1A23793CE0">
I conceive <HI>economy</HI> in expenditures, as nece&s;&s;ary a part of financiering, as the <HI>acquirement</HI> of a revenue: and I conceive in this, as in all other parts of public admini|&s;tration, good government depends more on the <HI>men who admini&s;ter,</HI> than on the &s;y&s;tem or form of the con&s;titution, the wi&s;dom of the laws, or prudence of the general orders; for let all the&s;e be ever &s;o good, if the executive part is not committed to indu&s;trious, wi&s;e, and faithful <HI>men,</HI> there will be a great failure of <HI>ju&s;tice, &s;ecurity,</HI> and <HI>peace.</HI></P>
<P>VI. I propo&s;e a review of all our departments, and <HI>re|ducing all unnece&s;&s;ary expenditures</HI> in them, as far as po&s;&s;ible. It is better to le&s;&s;en the expen&s;es, where it can be done with &s;afety, than to increa&s;e the revenue; the one le&s;&s;ens, the other increa&s;es the public burden. I am told there are 9000 rations i&s;&s;ued daily in this city, where there is not the lea&s;t appearance of any military movements, except a few invalids, and &s;ick in the ho&s;pital, and the pri&s;oners, all which do not amount to one third of the afore&s;aid num|ber of rations.</P>
<P>I am told there are po&s;ts of commi&s;&s;ioners, quarter-ma|&s;ters, purcha&s;ers, &amp;c. fixed at about 10 or 15 miles di&s;|tance from each other thro' this State, and &s;ome &s;ay thro the whole Thirteen States; if they were all &s;ent out of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> all the &s;upplies within reach of our market, would come of cour&s;e to this city, and might be all purcha&s;ed here by one man, much cheaper, and at le&s;s expen&s;e, than by all tho&s;e po&s;ts; &s;preading them about thro' the country an&s;wers the &s;ame end, as if a private man &s;hould &s;end a &s;ervant ten miles out of town to buy his marketing; he mu&s;t &s;olicit more, pay a higher price, and have a wor&s;e choice than if he &s;tayed at home, and bought in market. But I can|not pretend to go into the minutiae of the&s;e matters; I can only ob&s;erve, that people out of doors cannot at all conceive the rea&s;on or u&s;e of the&s;e multiplied officers of &s;o many dif|ferent names, that one has need of a dictionary to under|&s;tand them; I am apt to wi&s;h they were all &s;truck off the li&s;t, by one da&s;h of the pen, at lea&s;t that their rations and clothing might be &s;topped, and &s;ent to camp for the u&s;e of our &s;oldiers in real &s;ervice.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="023972_0078_0FC2BD1E07D02328">
I would add to my wi&s;h al&s;o, that their hor&s;es might be taken away from them, that they might not be able to pa|rade it thro' the country on hor&s;eback, or in carriages, as they now do with a gaiety of dre&s;s, importance of air, and grandeur of equipage, very chagrining to the impover|i&s;hed inhabitants who maintain them: I conceive this me|thod would &s;upply our camp very comfortably for &s;everal months, till our finances might be recruited by the nume|rous taxes which are coming in, and in this way the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of Loans might be prevented, or at lea&s;t le&s;&s;ened.</P>
<P>If it &s;hould not be thought expedient to &s;end <HI>their wines</HI> to camp, as I do not know that an abundance of liquors do &s;oldiers or any body el&s;e any good, I propo&s;e to &s;end them to vendue, as they have much engro&s;&s;ed that article of late, it is become very &s;carce and dear, and would pro|bably bring a great price, and the proceeds of them might be a &s;ea&s;onable &s;upply to the Continental Trea&s;ury, and further le&s;&s;en the nece&s;&s;ity of loaning.</P>
<P>In fine, my great object is to get our <HI>revenue fixed</HI> on a &s;ure and &s;ufficient foundation, and our <HI>expenditures reduced within the bounds of u&s;e, nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;afety and benefit of the community.</HI> In this ca&s;e our people will all be willing to contribute the aids nece&s;&s;ary; for the intentions of the peo|ple at large are <HI>ever upright,</HI> and it is rare that there is any difficulty with them in this re&s;pect, when they are con|vinced that the public monies are all <HI>prudently expended</HI> for nece&s;&s;ary u&s;es.</P>
<P>I further conceive that taxes are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, not only to &s;upply the public trea&s;ury, but to reduce our money to a fixed &s;tandard, and re&s;tore it to its natural and nece&s;|&s;ary u&s;e, which no other method of &s;upplying the trea&s;ury can do, and which yet mu&s;t be done, in order to deliver us from the mo&s;t dreadful calamity of a fluctuating currency. This I con&s;ider as of the mo&s;t weighty importance, and at the &s;ame time of &s;o critical, difficult, and intricate a na|ture, that it will require the utmo&s;t attention to the means of it, and the highe&s;t prudence and care to watch their operations, and add to or dimini&s;h their force as occa&s;ion may require.</P>

For if the money &s;hould appreciate, it will, over and above all private wrong, increa&s;e the national debt. An appreciation of only 10 per cent. which may be done al|mo&s;t imperceptibly, will add 20,000,000 to that debt, which mu&s;t be paid, not in &s;hadows, but by the hard la|bor of our people. Such is the <HI>&s;ubtile nature</HI> and <HI>impercep|tible <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">peration of this mighty error,</HI> that no degree of attenti|on to it can be deemed unnece&s;&s;ary. To mend this, I con|ceive to be the great work before us, <HI>hic labor, hoc opus e&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>I am but little concerned or alarmed at the pre&s;ent pinch of the trea&s;ury. Our re&s;ources are too great to permit &s;uch a temporary, &s;uch a momentary di&s;tre&s;s to be fatal; a proper reduction of our expenditures, or a &s;mall anticipa|tion of our revenue in any way, will remedy it. If the great &s;prings of our revenue can be put in motion, we may be ea&s;ily &s;aved, otherwi&s;e we mu&s;t peri&s;h.</P>
<P>I beg leave here to add, that the attention of Congre&s;s, however &s;ufficient, if it were not unavoidably drawn off by an infinity of other objects that con&s;tantly crowd upon them, is not and cannot be practicable in a degree ade|quate to this great object. Nor indeed do I think that any board of numbers or aggregate body would be likely to form a &s;y&s;tem &s;o exact, and be&s;tow an attention &s;o accurate and uniform as would be nece&s;&s;ary in this ca&s;e. I conceive it mu&s;t be the work of <HI>one mind,</HI> which ever could inve&s;ti|gate and &s;uperintend matters of an ab&s;tru&s;e nature and cri|tical movements better alone than with company; and therefore,</P>

<P>If a man adequate to this bu&s;ine&s;s could be found, I con|ceive his appointment would be of the highe&s;t utility to the States, as we may ea&s;ily conceive only by imagining the be|nefits which might have re&s;ulted from &s;uch an appoint|ment, had &s;uch an one been made five years ago.</P>

<P>THE &s;y&s;tem of taxation equal to the public expendi|tures, adopted and recommended by Congre&s;s,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The fir&s;t recommendation of Congre&s;s to the States <HI>to rai&s;e money by a tax</HI> (which I recollect) was on <HI>Jan.</HI> 14, 1777; but this was done in &s;o <HI>in|definite</HI> a manner, <HI>without any &s;ums or quotas &s;pecified,</HI> that little or nothing came of it.</P>
<P>In <HI>Nov.</HI> 22, 1777, Congre&s;s recommended to the States to <HI>rai&s;e</HI> 5,000,000 <HI>of dollars</HI> in the cour&s;e of the year 1778, in quarterly payments, <HI>with the quotas of each State annexed,</HI> &amp;c. but this had little effect; <HI>&s;mall &s;ums</HI> were rai&s;ed and paid by <HI>&s;ome of the States,</HI> within the year 1778; others made &s;ome remittances <HI>long afterwards,</HI> when the money was 20 for 1, or more, &amp;c. but great part was never paid at all.&mdash;In the addre&s;s of Congre&s;s to the people of the United States, <HI>May</HI> 8, 1778, is this expre&s;&s;ion; <Q>what are the rea&s;ons that your <HI>money is depreciated?</HI> Becau&s;e <HI>no taxes have been impo&s;ed</HI> to carry on the war.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Jan.</HI> 2, 1779, Congre&s;s re&s;olved, that the States be called on for their quotas of 15,000,000 <HI>of dollars,</HI> to be rai&s;ed by taxes for the year 1779, and of 6,000,000 <HI>of dollars</HI> to be rai&s;ed <HI>annually</HI> for 18 <HI>years,</HI> commencing with the year 1780; as a <HI>fund</HI> for &s;inking <HI>loans</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> paying inter|e&s;t,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 21, 1779, Congre&s;s re&s;olved, that the States &s;hould be called on for their quotas of the <HI>further</HI> &s;um of 45,000,000 <HI>of dollars,</HI> to be paid into the Continental Trea&s;ury before the 1<HI>&s;t of Jan.</HI> 1780.</P>
<P><HI>Oct.</HI> 6, 1779, they further re&s;olved, that the States be called on to rai&s;e their re&s;pective quotas of 15,000,000 <HI>of dollars, monthly;</HI> to be paid into the Continental Trea&s;ury on the 1<HI>&s;t day of Feb.</HI> 1780, and on the 1&s;t day day of <HI>each following</HI> month up to <HI>Oct.</HI> 1&s;t inclu&s;ive; <HI>i. e.</HI> 15,000,000 of dollars <HI>per month</HI> for 9 months &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, beginning with <HI>Feb.</HI> 1780.</P>
<P>This provi&s;ion for the year 1780, <HI>if continued thro' the year,</HI> would have amounted to 180,000,000 <HI>of dollars;</HI> to which if we add the annual 6,000,000 for that year, it would rai&s;e the &s;um to 186,000,000 of dollars; which, had, it been <HI>rigidly and effectually collected</HI> (as might be expected; for <HI>every body by this time,</HI> both in and out of Congre&s;s, <HI>&s;eemed pretty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> ear|ne&s;t for effectual taxes)</HI> I &s;ay, had this &s;um been <HI>rigidly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> it would doubtle&s;s have produced a <HI>very de&s;tructive</HI> and <HI>very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"></HI> of the currency, which it was my object in this E&s;&s;ay to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> avoid.</P>

<P><PB N="75" REF="023972_0082_0FC2BD335DAC2548">
Yet it is to be noted here with care and concern, that when the&s;e great and &s;teady principles come to operate on the pre&s;ent di&s;tracted &s;tate of our currency and finances, very <HI>&s;ad</HI> and perhaps <HI>fatal effects</HI> will be produced, and in|finite inju&s;tice done, even by this forcible remedy, tho' the mo&s;t &s;alutary and only effectual one, if &s;ome care is not taken to <HI>direct</HI> its force and <HI>limit</HI> its fir&s;t effects. The <HI>appreciation</HI> of our currency is among the fir&s;t of the&s;e ill con&s;equences which I fear, and would guard again&s;t. The evils of this I have con&s;idered in my Second E&s;&s;ay; but as what I there urged either has not been under&s;tood or regard|ed, I think it nece&s;&s;ary here to re&s;ume the &s;ubject, which cer|tainly merits the highe&s;t attention of every <HI>American.</HI></P>
<P>The value of Continental money is what it is <HI>now</HI> worth to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. The <HI>pre&s;ent exchange</HI> of Continental money
<PB N="76" REF="023972_0083_0FC2BD3465A60020">
is to hard money at the rate of about 40 <HI>to</HI> 1, tho' it is ve|ry fluctuating; at this exchange of 40 to 1, which is very near the truth, and for which I appeal to the merchants' and gold&s;miths' books, I &s;ay, at this exchange, our debt of continental money, <HI>i. e.</HI> all the continental money in cir|culation, is worth 5,000,000 <HI>of dollars in hard money.</HI> For the reader need not be told that that value is found by di|viding the whole &s;um of our currency, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> 200,000,000 <HI>of dollars,</HI> by the exchange, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> 40, which will make a quotient of 5,000,000 of dollars of hard money.</P>
<P>If this exchange is reduced, &s;ay to 20 for 1, it will in|crea&s;e this public debt to 10,000,000 of hard dollars. Therefore, it follows, that <HI>every appreciation</HI> of the money <HI>increa&s;es</HI> the public debt, and to an amazing degree, by movements, indeed almo&s;t imperceptible, yet certain, and to an amount almo&s;t beyond belief. For if the exchange &s;hould fall to 10 for 1, the debt would ri&s;e to 20,000,000; an exchange of 5 to 1 would rai&s;e the debt to 40,000,000 of hard dollars, and &s;o on till the debt would ri&s;e to 200,000,000 of hard dollars, and all this <HI>without the lea&s;t benefit to the public,</HI> but in every view to its <HI>detriment.</HI> For, over and above the va&s;t increa&s;e of taxes nece&s;&s;ary to pay this increa&s;ed debt, many other evils &s;till wor&s;e than the tax would follow, to which I mu&s;t beg the reader's mo&s;t &s;erious attention; for however out of &s;ight and di&s;tant it may appear, the mi&s;chief is infinite, and mu&s;t be fatal, if not prevented.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>This appreciation will rai&s;e the value of the money in the che&s;ts of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, in proportion as it increa&s;es the public debt.</HI> This will rai&s;e the <HI>great money-holders into nabobs,</HI> &s;o rich there will be no living with them. They have alrea|dy, it is generally thought, much more than their &s;hare. Men of <HI>overgrown riches,</HI> e&s;pecially of &s;udden acquirement, are <HI>dangerous</HI> to any community. They are not generally people of the <HI>be&s;t refinement of manners</HI> or <HI>wi&s;e&s;t di&s;cretion,</HI> and therefore, their influence in the community (which will ever be, <HI>caeteris paribus,</HI> in proportion to their wealth) will be dangerous; but were they all the be&s;t of men, &s;uch amazing and &s;udden acqui&s;itions of wealth would be enough
<PB N="77" REF="023972_0084_0FC2BD39D2D5C318">
to &s;poil them. We find, by long and various experience, that human nature cannot bear, without corruption, &s;uch &s;udden leaps into the heights of greatne&s;s, pro&s;perity, wealth, and influence.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>This &s;ame cau&s;e will induce all men to hoard their money,</HI> when <HI>they find it grows better and better daily in their che&s;ts.</HI> Money will &s;oon become &s;o &s;carce, as not to be obtained without great difficulty, and this will increa&s;e the value <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> appreciation of it; for the value of money will ever be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> proportion to its &s;carcity and demand. Thus every &s;tage of this mi&s;chief will tend to increa&s;e the evil, and lead on to further &s;tages of the &s;ame calamity and di&s;tre&s;s. This is obvious to every one.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>This &s;ame cau&s;e will ruin our trade and manufactures;</HI> for the ri&s;e of money in the de&s;k will be more profitable than any trade or branch of manufacture. This will <HI>ruin all indu&s;try;</HI> for the rich will not go into bu&s;ine&s;s, and the poor will not find employers, and this will produce &s;carcity of all goods, both home produced and imported, and of cour&s;e general di&s;tre&s;s and want mu&s;t follow.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>This &s;ame appreciation will increa&s;e the public debt, and con&s;equently will increa&s;e the taxes by which it mu&s;t be paid, and that in proportion to the value or amount of the apprecia|tion.</HI> The appreciation of money is like an account in a merchant's book; there mu&s;t be a <HI>debtor</HI> and <HI>creditor</HI> to it. It is not po&s;&s;ible that one &s;hilling &s;hould be <HI>gained</HI> by one per&s;on in this way, which is not <HI>lo&s;t</HI> by &s;omebody. If you make the money more valuable in my pocket, it will co&s;t the public more to redeem it; and therefore, if it was to be appreciated up to its original value, every man's tax mu&s;t be multiplied by the pre&s;ent exchange, <HI>i. e.</HI> made about 40 times greater than it need be, to redeem all the money at the pre&s;ent value; and therefore it is probable tho&s;e who think the pre&s;ent taxes are not more than the fortieth part of what they &s;hould be, will be zealous pro|moters of the &s;cheme of appreciation.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>This &s;ame thing will increa&s;e every private debt.</HI> For nothing is plainer than this, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> if the money is more va|luable at the time of payment than it was at the time of
<PB N="78" REF="023972_0085_0FC2BD3B2B31D4B0">
contract, the debt is thereby increa&s;ed, <HI>i. e.</HI> it will take more hard money, or more wheat to pay the debt, than would have paid it at the time of contract. This brings on the inevitable ruin of many poor people, who cannot avoid be|ing more or le&s;s in debt for rent or &s;ome other nece&s;&s;ary thing. It is hard enough for them to pay their debts at their ju&s;t value; but when the &s;um comes to be increa&s;ed, perhaps doubled or trebled in a few months, the payment becomes either extremely difficult or impo&s;&s;ible. This might at fir&s;t plea&s;e the rich pretty well, but they would find their mi&s;take, for they would be obliged &s;oon to ac|cept a notice of bankruptcy, in&s;tead of payment from their debtors.</P>
<P N="6">6. The great cry for appreciation is, that tho&s;e who have &s;uffered by depreciation ought to have the benefit of a com|pen&s;ation by the appreciation of the currency; but this is nugatory, and will prove in the end a perfect deception. <HI>For not one tenth part, perhaps not an hundredth part of the money, when it &s;hall appreciate, will be found in the hands of tho&s;e who have &s;uffered by the depreciation.</HI> It will be no ad|equate remedy to any of them, but will be an increa&s;e of di&s;tre&s;s and injury to far the greate&s;t part of them.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e per&s;ons who have &s;uffered by the depreciation, but by the chance of the times have been able to make it up &s;ome other way, &s;o as to be able to hoard up &s;ufficient <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of money to take advantage of the appreciation, tho&s;e, I &s;ay, are not the great objects of my concern; but the helple&s;s widow, the fatherle&s;s infant, and a thou&s;and others, who have been obliged, thro' the deficiency of their intere&s;t, to &s;pend on the principal, till it is all or mo&s;tly gone, tho&s;e, I &s;ay, are the <HI>great objects of pity;</HI> their <HI>cries for ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>compen&s;ation</HI> ought to be heard; the appreci|ation does them no good, for they have not ca&s;h on which it can operate; for nobody can take any benefit of the ap|preciation, but &s;uch as have more ca&s;h on hand than all their taxes will amount to; but the afore&s;aid widows&punc; &amp;c. are by the appreciation plunged into an increa&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> and injury; for if they have an acre of land, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ow left, they mu&s;t be loaded with a va&s;t incre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">,
<PB N="79" REF="023972_0086_0FC2BD3EE439F8B8">
in order to appreciate the money which <HI>they have l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">t,</HI> and which now lies hoarded in the coffers of their <HI>rich neigh|bours,</HI> who have gotten it from them.</P>
<P>From this view of the matter, it appears that many peo|ple may imagine that they &s;hall receive an advantage from the appreciation, and therefore cry loudly for it, who will, in the end, be greatly hurt by it. It &s;eems they a&s;k <HI>they know not what,</HI> like the mother of <HI>Zebedee'</HI>s children, who, in the ardency of maternal affection, petitioned our Savi|our that her two &s;ons might &s;it, the one on his <HI>right</HI> hand, and the other on his <HI>left,</HI> not con&s;idering that the purport of her petition was, that one of her &s;ons might be <HI>&s;aved</HI> and the other <HI>damned.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. The appreciation <HI>of the Continental bills</HI> will continue thro' the <HI>whole cour&s;e of it, all the mi&s;chiefs of a fluctuating currency.</HI> This de&s;troys or varies the <HI>&s;tandard</HI> or <HI>common mea&s;ure of value</HI> of all things bought or &s;old; renders all <HI>money-contracts</HI> and <HI>debts uncertain; corrupts the equity</HI> and <HI>alters the force of our laws,</HI> by varying the <HI>fines, forfeitures,</HI> and <HI>fees</HI> limited by them; and in &s;hort, throws both the <HI>private man in his dealings,</HI> and the <HI>judge on the bench,</HI> into &s;uch perplexity and confu&s;ion, that neither can have due <HI>knowledge of right,</HI> even when they may be di&s;po&s;ed to do it, whil&s;t the <HI>wicked</HI> have the greate&s;t latitude in which they may practi&s;e <HI>&s;hocking wrongs,</HI> and that in the <HI>face of the &s;un,</HI> and <HI>with impunity.</HI> This &s;u&s;pends the <HI>rewards of virtue</HI> and the <HI>puni&s;hment of vice, corrupts the morals</HI> of the people, and in the end <HI>produces every evil work.</HI> Surely this picture is dreary.</P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>From all the&s;e mi&s;chiefs no one benefit can ari&s;e to the public.</HI> Every <HI>advantage</HI> of the appreciation goes to the <HI>rich men</HI> who have got the money hoarded, and to them <HI>alone.</HI> Why then all this more than <HI>Herculean labor</HI> of ap|preciating the money? why all the&s;e ri&s;ks and public dan|gers? why all this multiplied <HI>burden and di&s;tre&s;s</HI> on our people? The u&s;es of the currency are to every purpo&s;e as great to the public, if fixed at the pre&s;ent value, at two pence or three pence the dollar, as at any <HI>other value</HI> that can be named.</P>

<P>But if the money is appreciated, the tax will have a very different effect, as will be obvious at fir&s;t &s;ight, only by viewing its operation in one very familiar in&s;tance, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Suppo&s;e two brothers have each a plantation of equal va|lue, &s;ay worth 1000<HI>l.</HI> hard money each, and one of them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ells his plantation for 1000<HI>l</HI> hard money, and changes that money into 40,000<HI>l.</HI> continental money, and the tax comes on; and we will further &s;uppo&s;e they are both taxed according to the value of their e&s;tates, <HI>i. e.</HI> equally, and that the tax nece&s;&s;ary to appreciate the money be 20 per cent. on the whole value; it appears then plain that the tax of <HI>the one,</HI> who keeps his plantation, will be 200<HI>l.</HI> hard money, and the tax of <HI>the other,</HI> who has 40,000<HI>l.</HI> continental money, will be 8000<HI>l.</HI> of that money; con&s;e|quently, the fir&s;t will have a clear e&s;tate le&s;t of 800<HI>l.</HI> hard money value, but the other will have an e&s;tate worth 32,000<HI>l.</HI> hard money, for by the &s;uppo&s;ition all the money he has left will be <HI>appreciated</HI> up to its original value, <HI>i. e.</HI> to the value of hard money, and will be worth 40 times as much as his brother's e&s;tate. But if all the&s;e arguments do not convince, I have one more, which, I think, mu&s;t do for the hardie&s;t opponent; it is this:&mdash;</P>
<P N="10">10. <HI>The &s;cheme of appreciation will de&s;troy it&s;elf; it is in its nature impracticable, and its own operation will work its de&s;truction.</HI> For the appreciation of the currency will in|crea&s;e the <HI>taxes</HI> and <HI>public burdens</HI> to &s;uch an enormous and <HI>in&s;upportable amount,</HI> that the people neither <HI>can,</HI> or <HI>will,</HI> or <HI>ought to bear them.</HI> When they come to be told that all their taxes are not at all for the benefit of the public, but are for no other purpo&s;e than to increa&s;e the value of the money hoarded by their rich neighbours (and <HI>they certainly

<P>Then the mighty bubble will &s;ink into nothing, and with it will go all our <HI>revenue, public faith, defence, honor,</HI> and <HI>political exi&s;tence.</HI></P>
<P>Very many things more might be added on this fertile &s;ubject; but if what I have &s;aid in my Second E&s;&s;ay on this &s;ubject, and what I have repeated and added here, is not &s;ufficient for conviction, it is vain and u&s;ele&s;s in my opinion to add more, and &s;hall only here beg my reader's patience and attention a moment to an affair of my own.</P>
<P>I do here, as an individual, <HI>enter my prote&s;t</HI> mo&s;t &s;olemn|ly again&s;t this mo&s;t fatal, u&s;ele&s;s, and chimerical &s;cheme of appreciating the currency, and am determined to leave a copy of my E&s;&s;ays with my children, that my po&s;terity may know that in 1780 there was, at lea&s;t, <HI>one citizen</HI> of Phi|ladelphia who was not totally di&s;tracted, and that they may have the honor and con&s;olation of being de&s;cended from a man, who was able to keep <HI>in his &s;en&s;es</HI> in times of the greate&s;t <HI>infatuation.</HI></P>
<P>But all this notwith&s;tanding, and altho' appearances are &s;trong again&s;t me, I will &s;till hope that there yet is a judi|cious majority on my &s;ide, who are thoroughly &s;ick of all <HI>vi&s;ionary projects,</HI> and wi&s;h to adopt the <HI>&s;ub&s;tantial and &s;ure</HI> remedies which &s;till remain in our power. With &s;uch as the&s;e I will mo&s;t cheerfully join in company, and &s;it down with them with great plea&s;ure, and unite in farther con&s;ul|tation on the important &s;ubject, begging this favor at the &s;ame time of the re&s;t, who do not like our employment, that they would not come into the room to interrupt us; and this they cannot think a hard&s;hip, as they certainly can lo&s;e nothing by it, for I really have not one word more to &s;ay to them.</P>
<P>If it is granted that the currency ought not to be appre|ciated up to its original value, <HI>I cannot &s;ee a &s;hadow of rea|&s;on why it &s;hould be appreciated at all, and not be fixed at its pre&s;ent value.</HI> The <HI>truth</HI> is always better than <HI>any thing near it,</HI> altho' ever &s;o near. Every &s;hilling that it may be appre|ciated
<PB N="82" REF="023972_0089_0FC2BD4817B04CF0">
is added to the public debt, for which the public receives not the <HI>lea&s;t advantage,</HI> but all the <HI>profit</HI> goes to the <HI>great hoarders</HI> of our currency; for tho&s;e who have no more on hand than ju&s;t the amount of their whole tax get nothing by it. There remain then but two things to be con&s;idered: 1&s;t. <HI>What the pre&s;ent exchange of the currency is;</HI> and 2dly. <HI>How to fix it to that exchange or value.</HI></P>
<P>I. As to the fir&s;t of the&s;e there is a difficulty, principally ari&s;ing from this, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that the exchange is not the <HI>&s;ame</HI> in all the States, but <HI>different</HI> in the different States, and this difference is not fixed in the different States, but &s;ometimes varies in the &s;everal parts of the &s;ame State. But it is here to be ob&s;erved, that the exchange of the &s;everal parts of the State differs very little from that which prevails in the great capitals neare&s;t to them, and what little variation there is, mo&s;t generally appears to lie in this, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that the exchange ri&s;es <HI>fir&s;t in the great capitals,</HI> and the <HI>out towns,</HI> of le&s;s trade, follow pretty <HI>quickly</HI> after them; &s;o that the exchange of each State may be pretty &s;afely taken from that of its capital, or the great capital to which it is mo&s;t contiguous.</P>
<P>The rule by which I find the true exchange at any given time is, to take the exchange which prevailed at the given time in each State, and add them all together and divide the &s;um by 13, and the quotient will be the mean exchange or value of the currency. For in&s;tance, by the be&s;t advice I can collect, the exchange <HI>la&s;t Chri&s;tmas,</HI> or <HI>December</HI> 25, 1779, was, in the four <HI>New-England</HI> States, <HI>New-York, North</HI> and <HI>South Carolina,</HI> and <HI>Georgia, i. e.</HI> in eight States, at 35 for 1, and in <HI>New-Jer&s;ey, Penn&s;ylvania, Delaware, Maryland,</HI> and <HI>Virginia, i. e.</HI> in five States, at 40 for 1, their &s;ums will &s;tand thus,&mdash;

which &s;um divided by 13 gives a quotient of 36 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">/23 or 37 nearly, which I &s;uppo&s;e to be the true mean exchange or
<PB N="83" REF="023972_0090_0FC2BD5B7A121E90">
averaged value of the currency, through all the Thirteen States, at that time.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent exchange in this city is 45 to 1, and the ex|change was ri&s;ing both to the ea&s;tward and &s;outhward when the la&s;t advices came away, &s;o that I &s;uppo&s;e the pre&s;ent mean exchange may &s;afely and truly be fixed at 40 for 1, but our future advices will &s;oon determine this beyond all doubt. This is throwing a&s;ide all theory and &s;peculation, and grounding my computation entirely on fact, and is a method which I expect will be allowed to be fair, true, and unexceptionable; <HI>and at this value I propo&s;e that the cur|rency &s;hould be fixed at pre&s;ent, and be finally redeemed at the &s;ame.</HI> Both the&s;e I conceive very ju&s;t and practicable.</P>
<P>I do not think there is any ju&s;tice in taxing the public to appreciate any man's money in his che&s;t beyond the pre|&s;ent value. This would be burdening the public, merely for the benefit of a few individuals of monied men; for I before ob&s;erved that no per&s;on could take benefit of &s;uch an appreciation, but &s;uch as have more money on hand than all their taxes for redeeming the whole currency will amount to; and tho&s;e few among us who have &s;uch a &s;ur|plus of money are the men who have the lea&s;t occa&s;ion of a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the public, and in general have the lea&s;t right to expect or even to wi&s;h it. For a further con&s;ide|ration of this I refer back to all the rea&s;ons I have given again&s;t an appreciation.</P>
<P>On the other hand, it will be readily granted that every principle of ju&s;tice requires that any further depreciation of our currency &s;hould, if po&s;&s;ible, be prevented. The <HI>prac|ticability</HI> of both the&s;e, <HI>i. e. of fixing the currency,</HI> de&s;erves our mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;ideration; and here, notwith&s;tanding the unaccountable and &s;eemingly capricious fluctuation of the exchange, both in progre&s;&s;ive and retrograde motion (for we have frequently &s;een both) yet I &s;ay, this notwith|&s;tanding, I do contend <HI>there are great natural principles, which, if properly applied, will confine this &s;lippery &s;ubject, fix it to a point, and prevent &s;uch fluctuation as will greatly prejudice its u&s;e.</HI>&mdash;To prevent an APPRECIATION,</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="023972_0091_0FC2BD5C1ED105D8">
I. As the currency has no real fixed value in it&s;elf, it is nece&s;&s;ary that <HI>it &s;hould be connected, tied, or fa&s;tened firmly to &s;omething that is fixed, which may hold it &s;teady,</HI> as an an|chor does a &s;hip, which keeps its place by that connection, let the wind or tide &s;et either way. Such a fixed medium is hard money, the value of which cannot vary much from its value in <HI>Europe,</HI> and therefore its permanency may be &s;afely depended on. To this end I propo&s;e,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That an order of Congre&s;s be pa&s;&s;ed, that hard money &s;hall be received for taxes and all other payments into the Continen|tal Trea&s;ury, at the pre&s;ent value or fixed exchange;</HI> &s;ay 40 for 1. For as the demand for taxes will be very great and univer&s;al; if the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem of taxation be carried into effectual execution, as it doubtle&s;s will be, it will not be po&s;&s;ible for any man to get a better exchange than is re|ceived in the public trea&s;ury.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>I propo&s;e that a re&s;olution pa&s;s to redeem the whole cur|rency finally at the pre&s;ent value;</HI> &s;ay 40 for 1. This will effectually take away all inducement to rai&s;e the value of it beyond the exchange which can finally be obtained for it, when it &s;hall be redeemed. I do apprehend that my rea|&s;ons before a&s;&s;igned again&s;t the appreciation will prove the ju&s;tice, good policy, and nece&s;&s;ity of the&s;e re&s;olutions, to which I therefore refer.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>I propo&s;e that all public e&s;timates, quotas, payments, &amp;c. be made in hard money, or Continental equal to it at the cur|rent exchange,</HI> and al&s;o <HI>that all judgments of courts, fees, &s;alaries, &amp;c. &s;hould be made up in the &s;ame manner,</HI> that &s;o no public community or private per&s;on &s;hould receive either injury or benefit from any future fluctuation of the curren|cy, either up or down, if &s;uch &s;hould happen, any farther than his ca&s;h on hand might be affected by it. This would not only be an effectual remedy of the crying inju&s;tice, both public and private, which has too long prevailed among us, but will al&s;o take away the principal inducement and tempt|ation to attempt any fluctuation of the currency.</P>
<P N="4">4. I propo&s;e, for the more effectual operation of this remedy, <HI>that all the tender acts, all laws again&s;t dealing in hard money, and every other of that nature which now &s;ub&s;i&s;t
<PB N="85" REF="023972_0092_0FC2BD5F03793C88">
in any</HI> of the States, may be repealed. As tho&s;e acts were mo&s;tly made on the recommendation of Congre&s;s, I appre|hend a recommendation of that honorable body to the &s;e|veral States for &s;uch repeal might be nece&s;&s;ary.&mdash;It appears to me that the&s;e propo&s;itions will mo&s;t effectually prevent any future <HI>appreciation</HI> of our currency.</P>
<P>But it may be &s;aid here, we are &s;ufficiently out of dan|ger of that, the pre&s;ent labor is &s;top the <HI>depreciation.</HI> But I do not know all this. I have many rea&s;ons to fear an ap|preciation, which would be a very ruinous calamity if it &s;hould happen, and I think we may do well to u&s;e precau|tions again&s;t a po&s;&s;ible evil; and I have at lea&s;t the com|mon argument of quacks in favor of my propo&s;itions, <Q>that they are innocent, they can do no hurt, and they may do good.</Q> If the event to which they are de&s;igned to be applied &s;hould happen, they will be of the utmo&s;t u&s;e and benefit; if that event &s;hould not happen, their opera|tion will be prevented, and no bad effects can proceed from them. I am as &s;en&s;ible as any man of the urgent nece&s;&s;ity of preventing a farther depreciation, and therefore recur to &s;uch great natural principles as I think will mo&s;t effectu|ally and a&s;&s;uredly remedy the mi&s;chief; and here I hope it will not be taken ami&s;s, if I repeat &s;ome things I have heretofore advanced; for great truths, and weighty princi|ples of deci&s;ive importance, ought often to be repeated, that they may be better kept in mind. I proceed then, to prevent DEPRECIATION,</P>
<P>II. To ob&s;erve, that <HI>one great cau&s;e of depreciation is the increa&s;e of the quantity of our currency, and therefore the quan|tity mu&s;t by no means be increa&s;ed.</HI> For it is not po&s;&s;ible to prevent the operation of &s;uch increa&s;e on the depreciation. It matters not in what &s;hape &s;uch an increa&s;e may appear, whether <HI>of Continental bills, certificates, bills on</HI> Europe, <HI>or bills of particular States. If the quantity in circulation is in|crea&s;ed, it is not in the nature of the thing po&s;&s;ible to prevent the effect of depreciation, which mu&s;t and will flow from that increa&s;e.</HI> Therefore, <HI>the incomes mu&s;t be made equal to the expenditures.</HI> This will give the currency a quick circula|tion, &s;ufficient for every purpo&s;e, without any increa&s;e of
<PB N="86" REF="023972_0093_0FC2BD5FF6B57288">
its quantity, will rai&s;e that demand for it, which is e&s;&s;enti|al to its nature and u&s;e, and from its natural operation will prevent any po&s;&s;ibility of depreciation, if the confidence of the public in its final redemption can be made entire and free of doubt.</P>
<P>And this brings me to the con&s;ideration of another great principle, on which the credit of all bills mu&s;t depend, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>the final redemption of the bills mu&s;t be made certain, and the value or exchange at which they &s;hall be finally paid or redeemed mu&s;t be certainly known.</HI> If there is any doubt of either of the&s;e in the minds of the people, that doubt will le&s;&s;en the value of the bills; for a certainty will always be better than an uncertainty, <HI>i. e.</HI> the credit of the States mu&s;t &s;tand &s;o firmly connected with their real &s;ub&s;tance, that there can be no doubt but the one will be &s;upported by the other. The life and u&s;e of money lies in a quick and ready circu|lation; yet, although this circulation &s;hould be ever &s;o bri&s;k, if it pa&s;&s;es from hand to hand, like <HI>Robin's alive,</HI> in con&s;tant danger of <HI>dying in the la&s;t hand,</HI> it mu&s;t, notwith|&s;tanding all its &s;igns of life and vigor, depreciate fa&s;t; and <HI>I conceive a general confidence or doubt of this kind has operated more on our currency than people are generally aware of.</HI></P>
<P>In the gloomy a&s;pect of our affairs in the winter of 1778, when the <HI>Briti&s;h army</HI> had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> the exchange ro&s;e to 6, 7, <HI>and</HI> 8 <HI>for</HI> 1. In the &s;ummer and fall of the &s;ame year, when we began to feel the great effects of General <HI>Gates'</HI>s <HI>&s;ucce&s;s,</HI> the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;ued for peac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> and their army left <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> our alliance with <HI>France</HI> was formed, with a pro&s;pect of the acce&s;&s;ion of <HI>Spain,</HI> and a powerful <HI>French</HI> fleet was on our coa&s;t, the exchange fell to 4 <HI>for</HI> 1, and kept down for many months to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>
<P>But when our &s;anguine expectations began to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, new difficulties aro&s;e, and the multiplied emi&s;&s;ions had &s;welled the quantity of our currency to an enormous amount, be|yond any probability or even po&s;&s;ibility of payment <HI>at full value,</HI> there en&s;ued a <HI>great abatement of the general confidence,</HI> and mighty doubts aro&s;e whether it would ever be redeem|ed at all, or, if it was, at what value; and the&s;e doubts in|crea&s;ed with the increa&s;e of the quantity, and &s;ome other
<PB N="87" REF="023972_0094_0FC2BD6173A74C10">
cau&s;es, till the exchange ro&s;e up to the enormous height which now exi&s;ts. The principal cau&s;es of the&s;e doubts, and con&s;equently of the depreciation, I take it, have been <HI>the uncertainty of the fate of the war, or &s;upport of our In|dependence, and the increa&s;ing enormous &s;um of our currency.</HI> I conceive all doubts ari&s;ing from the fir&s;t of the&s;e cau&s;es are pretty well done away.</P>
<P>I think it is &s;o far from remaining a doubt whether we &s;hall &s;upport our Independence, that <HI>I do not apprehend it is in our power to give it up if we were willing,</HI> and to fall back into the dominion of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI> I am of opinion that <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> and perhaps &s;ome other powers, mu&s;t be conquered, before the <HI>trade</HI> or <HI>government of America</HI> can be permitted to be monopolized and controlled by <HI>Great-Britain.</HI> The va&s;t <HI>extent</HI> of our country, the <HI>fertility</HI> of our &s;oil, <HI>&s;alubrity</HI> of our climates, with other natural ad|vantages, together with the <HI>rapid increa&s;e</HI> of our people, agriculture, and arts, make us an object of va&s;t import|ance, expectation, and attention with every trading country of <HI>Europe,</HI> and they will not ea&s;ily give up the &s;hare of pro|fit which they expect to derive from us.</P>
<P>If we continue to increa&s;e as we have done in time pa&s;t, that is, to <HI>double every 25 years,</HI> the Thirteen States will contain more people at the end of the next century, than <HI>France, Spain,</HI> and <HI>Great-Britain</HI> together all contain at pre&s;ent. All <HI>Europe</HI> gaze with attention on our ri&s;ing great|ne&s;s, and it is a pity that <HI>America,</HI> like &s;ome <HI>carele&s;s beauty,</HI> &s;hould be the only per&s;on in the company, <HI>in&s;en&s;ible of her charms.</HI> It is time for us to know our own importance, and not throw our&s;elves away in a needle&s;s de&s;pondency.</P>
<P>As to the doubts ari&s;ing from the great quantity of our currency, and the con&s;equent uncertainty of its redempti|on, I conceive they will be effectually removed by the fore|going propo&s;itions. The pre&s;ent debt of Continental money cea&s;es to appear enormous; it does not exceed 5,000,000 <HI>of hard dollars,</HI> which is le&s;s than 2 dollars per head on the inhabitants; a light burden! a trifle! not adequate to the abilities of the poore&s;t town in the Thirteen States. The only remaining doubt is, whether the States <HI>will in fact
<PB N="88" REF="023972_0095_0FC2BD62E13AF158">
pay this &s;um,</HI> &s;mall as it is. This doubt appears to me ri|diculous; for were we to &s;uppo&s;e there was not a grain of <HI>honor</HI> or <HI>hone&s;ty</HI> left in the Thirteen States, on which we could depend for the payment of their debts, yet they have &s;uffered &s;o much by the depreciation of their currency, that they will, from a principle of <HI>&s;elf-pre&s;ervation,</HI> remedy the mi&s;chief, and prevent it in future. A burnt child dreads the fire, and certainly we have not lo&s;t all the feel|ings of human nature, however callous we may be to the inducements of moral principles.</P>
<P>But <HI>my confidence, even in the morality of the States, is not &s;haken, it is entire.</HI> It is my opinion our people are able and willing to do all that is nece&s;&s;ary to be done in the pre|&s;ent cri&s;is. Nothing more is or can be nece&s;&s;ary, than to put the matter in a <HI>proper train of operation.</HI></P>
<P>Let the people &s;ee the <HI>expenditures</HI> made with <HI>prudence and economy;</HI> that the <HI>demand</HI> of public money is grounded on <HI>public nece&s;&s;ity only;</HI> let them &s;ee men acting in the offices, through which the public monies are to pa&s;s, in whom they can have <HI>confidence;</HI> let them &s;ee a <HI>&s;y&s;tem of fi|nance</HI> formed, which &s;hall appear both <HI>practicable and &s;uffi|cient,</HI> and put under <HI>&s;uch direction</HI> as &s;hall afford a good pro|bability of <HI>prudent management and effectual execution;</HI> let the&s;e things be done (and I do not take them to be moun|tains impracticable) and I conceive our public faith will be effectually re&s;tored, and ri&s;e to &s;uch a degree of re&s;pectabi|lity, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o branch of the revenue will dare to defraud the trea&s;ury, or withhold the &s;upplies nece&s;&s;ary to the public &s;afety; no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, on the other hand, will our public faith prove a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and infamous trap to tho&s;e who have tru&s;ted their fortunes to its &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>I do not pretend the&s;e are light matters and without dif|ficulty. <HI>The f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rming a &s;y&s;tem of finance is an arduous work, fully <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to the abilities of a per&s;on of the &s;tronge&s;t intellects, &s;teady attention, and aptitude to the &s;ubject.

<P>The power of <HI>&s;uperintendence</HI> and <HI>legal &s;anction</HI> is theirs; but the <HI>calculation and execution</HI> of the &s;y&s;tem is not, in my humble opinion, compatible to the &s;enatorial body. The <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament, &s;ome years ago, aboli&s;hed the <HI>Julian &s;tyle,</HI> and adopted the <HI>Gregorian,</HI> and gave it legal &s;anction, to the great &s;atisfaction and benefit of the kingdom; but I never heard any man &s;uppo&s;e that that Parliament was ever capable of <HI>calculating or demon&s;trating</HI> either of the &s;tyles; yet I do not apprehend that it is any reflection on the dig|nity, abilities, or competency of that Parliament to &s;up|po&s;e, that, if nobody could have calculated &s;tyles better than they could, we might have done without any till this time, and computed the advance of the &s;pring by the bud|ding of white-oak trees, as the <HI>Indians</HI> do.</P>
<P>The con&s;equence from all this is, in my opinion, that if a &s;enatorial body want &s;tyles, &s;y&s;tems of finance, or any things el&s;e which require peculiar abilities, &s;uch as by com|mon probability cannot be pre&s;umed to exi&s;t in &s;uch a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|dy, they can only manife&s;t their wi&s;dom and employ their authority in appointing men of proper abilities to make them; then the Senate can <HI>examine</HI> and <HI>correct</HI> them, and <HI>add their &s;anction</HI> and authority, put the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">cution of them</HI> under a proper direction, and keep the <HI>&s;uperintendence only</HI> in them&s;elves. I think it may ea&s;ily appear, that <HI>the nature of the &s;ubject limits the powers of a Senate to this line of con|duct.</HI></P>
<P>But were it not &s;o, good policy would pre&s;cribe this method; for <HI>the ground of finance is, every &s;tep of is, mo&s;t dangerous ground.</HI> Errors are at fir&s;t imperceptible and ea|&s;ily made, but &s;oon &s;hoot up into capital importance, and often a&s;&s;ume a mo&s;t hideous and gha&s;tly appearance; all which is apt to throw di&s;grace and cen&s;ure, and &s;ometimes contempt, on the authors.

<HI>ignorance</HI> may be attributed to <HI>bad de&s;ign.</HI> In any view, mi&s;takes and di&s;appointments prove the ignorance or im|perfection of the managers, and there will always be &s;ome degree of <HI>contempt due to per&s;ons</HI> who undertake things which they <HI>know not how</HI> to perform.</P>

<P>The abilities requi&s;ite to form and execute &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem are not to be found or expected in any <HI>&s;enatorial body; i. e.</HI> by common probability it cannot be pre&s;umed, that the component members of &s;uch a body &s;hould be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the rare and peculiar abilities requi&s;ite for this great pur|po&s;e.</P>

<P>The&s;e are my be&s;t thoughts, the &s;ubject is too va&s;t, too unexplored for my comprehen&s;ion. This is my fourth ad|dre&s;s to the public on this weighty theme. I am obliged for the favorable reception of the other three, hope the &s;ame candor will be extended to this. My thoughts are free, the nature and incidents of the &s;ubject dictate my argument.

<P>My clo&s;e attention to this great and intricate &s;ubject has taught me that it baffles all &s;peculative theory and calcula|tion.

<HEAD>A FIFTH ESSAY ON FREE TRADE and FINANCE.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Fir&s;t publi&s;hed in Philadelphia, March 30, 1780.</HEAD>
<P>THE expenditures of the pre&s;ent year 1780, are e&s;ti|mated (as I am told) at about 10,000,000 of dollars hard money. This &s;um mu&s;t be rai&s;ed and paid, or our defence mu&s;t be di&s;continued; we mu&s;t lo&s;e our liberties and probably many of our heads too; our &s;truggles mu&s;t vani&s;h into &s;moke and di&s;grace; and our glorious <HI>revolution</HI> mu&s;t be dubbed <HI>rebellion,</HI> and puni&s;hed as &s;uch, and how much more God knows. The &s;aid <HI>&s;um</HI> mu&s;t be <HI>rai&s;ed,</HI> or <HI>the&s;e mi&s;eries mu&s;t en&s;ue.</HI> We have no other alternative, and it is vain and idle to amu&s;e our&s;elves with any hopes or even &s;hadows of any other. Our <HI>defence</HI> cannot be conti|nued without the <HI>nece&s;&s;ary money;</HI> if that cea&s;es, we in|&s;tantly lie open to the full power of our enemies, and mu&s;t &s;ubmit to any conditions they may pre&s;cribe.</P>
<P>This I take to be the plain &s;tate of the facts; &s;tubborn facts, which can neither be removed, eluded, or &s;oftened, by any po&s;&s;ible <HI>fine&s;&s;e, coloring,</HI> or <HI>eva&s;ions.</HI> We may as well keep them in <HI>&s;ight</HI> as to <HI>&s;hut our eyes</HI> again&s;t them; for <HI>facts they are, and will have their operation, which we mu&s;t feel, whether we will &s;ee them or not.</HI> If the expenditures, on which the e&s;timates are made, can be reduced, doubt|le&s;s

every po&s;&s;ible attention will be paid to &s;uch an object, but we cannot flatter our&s;elves that any very con&s;iderable &s;avings can be made in this way; it only remains then that we &s;et our&s;elves <HI>immediately</HI> to rai&s;e the money, or give up the cau&s;e in de&s;pair. I &s;ay IMMEDIATELY, for it will &s;oon be too late; every department will be &s;o involved in debt, and the difficulties, di&s;appointments, and confu&s;ions thence ari&s;ing will multiply &s;o fa&s;t, that no remedy can be admitted.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To this E&s;&s;ay, when fir&s;t publi&s;hed, the following preface was prefix|ed, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> "The urging taxes, I know very well, is an unpopular ta&s;k, and generally meets a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">our reception</HI> and very <HI>little thanks;</HI> but the <HI>belly</HI> mu&s;t be fed, or all the <HI>members</HI> mu&s;t peri&s;h, and it is not po&s;&s;ible it &s;hould <HI>convey</HI> nu|triment which it does not <HI>receive.</HI> When we find a general decay and weak|ne&s;s &s;preading into every limb and nerve of the body, it is time to attend ve|ry &s;eriou&s;ly to the <HI>malady,</HI> and every other con&s;ideration mu&s;t give place to the <HI>remedy.</HI> If there is a di&s;order or worm in the bowels which devours much of the food, it is a &s;ad circum&s;tance indeed, but &s;till the belly mu&s;t be fed, while we are taking every method in our power to extract or kill the worm. <HI>Truth,</HI> however di&s;agreeable, <HI>will force it&s;elf</HI> into notice and attention, and <HI>to know it</HI> is always &s;afer than <HI>to be deceived;</HI> our <HI>deception</HI> or <HI>ignorance</HI> will not retard the ha&s;ty &s;teps <HI>of ruin.</HI> The man who <HI>points out</HI> the real di&s;tre&s;&s;es and dangers or errors of the State, does not <HI>make</HI> them; the knowledge of them tends to a remedy. I therefore hope my humble attempt may be re|ceived with candour, however di&s;agreeable the &s;ubject, a pre&s;ent and dili|gent attention to which, I conceive ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the public &s;afety.

<P>In a cri&s;is of danger, when the mo&s;t &s;pirited and re&s;o|lute efforts are called for, to &s;ee <HI>men</HI> like children &s;tand with one hand in their eyes, and the other in their mouths, blubbering out with voices half a&s;&s;ured, <HI>I cannot! I can|not! I dare not! I dare not!</HI> is ridiculous, argues &s;uch meanne&s;s of &s;pirit, &s;uch heartle&s;s cowardice, I am a&s;ham|ed of it. If I really thought the people of <HI>America</HI> ca|pable of this, I would not move a finger to &s;ave them from that &s;lavery and &s;ubjection for which they mu&s;t, in that ca&s;e, be &s;o well fitted by nature; it would not move my pity to &s;ee them <HI>la&s;hed</HI> by their ma&s;ters into that <HI>&s;everity</HI> of effort, which their cowardly &s;ouls had not <HI>animation</HI> enough to <HI>exert</HI> in defence of their own liberties.</P>
<P>The very <HI>taxes</HI> which we now he&s;itate to <HI>impo&s;e on our|&s;elves</HI> to defend and &s;ecure our liberties, will, I dare &s;ay,
<PB N="99" REF="023972_0106_0FC2B5882C9CB338">
be <HI>impo&s;ed</HI> and <HI>rigidly extorted</HI> by our enemies, whenever they &s;hall get their yoke on our necks: the price which they will make us pay for our <HI>chains,</HI> will be greater than that which is now nece&s;&s;ary to pay for our <HI>liberty;</HI> the <HI>temporary</HI> burdens which are now demanded to &s;ecure the well-being of our&s;elves and po&s;terity, will be made <HI>perpetu|al</HI> on us and them by our enemies, when they &s;hall find it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ecure <HI>our</HI> &s;lavery and <HI>their</HI> luxury: for did any man ever know or read the hi&s;tory of any country, governed as an appendage of a di&s;tant empire, that was not fleeced, if not &s;kinned and peeled to the bone, by their di&s;tant, unfeeling, un&s;ympathizing de&s;pots. Such countries are never, in &s;uch ca&s;e, e&s;timated by any other &s;cale, than the amount of the revenue and other advantages that can be drawn from them.</P>
<P>I do not really think that the people of the United States are at all the proper &s;ubjects of this kind of government; I do not think a meanne&s;s of &s;pirit, a gro&s;s &s;tupidity, or cowardly diffidence makes any part of their character; they have, in fact, re&s;ented injuries, a&s;&s;erted their liberties, and nobly dared to defend them, with a degree of exertion, per&s;everance, and firmne&s;s, unparalleled and almo&s;t beyond belief. It is my opinion that we may &s;afely depend on any <HI>degree of exertion</HI> and <HI>&s;pirit</HI> in our people, which is nece&s;&s;ary to their &s;afety; and if this is not all called out and put in force, when and to any degree the public &s;afety may require it, the fault will lie in the <HI>rulers,</HI> not in the <HI>peo|ple.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed I am of opinion, there are few in&s;tances of any countries over-run or en&s;laved, thro' any <HI>defect of virtue</HI> in the <HI>people,</HI> which does not originate in their <HI>rulers;</HI> the natural and common &s;ource of remedies lies in the rulers, and if they are good, they will &s;ee the mi&s;chief, and apply the remedy, before it ri&s;es to &s;uch force as to endanger the liberties of a country. If vice or corruption gets ground in any popular &s;tate, it generally di&s;covers it&s;elf pretty ear|ly in the appointment of <HI>officers of notorious improper cha|racter,</HI> or in&s;ufficient abilities, to fill and manage the im|portant departments of the &s;tate; for where any corruption
<PB N="100" REF="023972_0107_0FC2B58A09670B20">
or prejudice prevails in any &s;tate, they will generally en|deavour to get into place, &s;uch officers as are likely to <HI>&s;upport &s;uch corruption or prejudice.</HI></P>
<P>In this ca&s;e, the mi&s;chief is carried into the very <HI>&s;ource of remedy,</HI> and corruption gets a whip-row, which gains by every movement; and if this whip-row can be broken, the game mu&s;t &s;oon be up, and there remains nothing to do, but to &s;et again, and try a new game. But as all that is <HI>not our ca&s;e,</HI> this may be deemed a needle&s;s digre&s;&s;ion: we will come then directly to what <HI>is our ca&s;e,</HI> which I will here endeavour to &s;tate as it &s;tands in fact, which no fretting, or je&s;ting, or &s;hrugging can alter.</P>
<P>I. The e&s;timates of the pre&s;ent year amount to about 10,000,000 of hard dollars, or the value of them, which mu&s;t <HI>be paid</HI> by &s;omebody, or <HI>our defence cannot be continued.</HI> If this cea&s;es, our country mu&s;t lie-open to the unre&s;train|ed ravages and plunders of our enemies, and every obnoxi|ous individual be expo&s;ed to their vengeance, and we have &s;een enough of them to know that their tender mercies are cruelty. And the only que&s;tion I conceive that can ari&s;e here is this, Whether this heavy burden &s;hall be laid on a <HI>part only</HI> of our people, and cru&s;h them into ruin; or whether it &s;hall be laid <HI>equably on all?</HI> In the latter ca&s;e, heavy as it is, it may be borne; it will not amount to more than 4 dollars on each per&s;on, or 20 dollars on a middling family of 5 per&s;ons. If there is a beggar in the Thirteen States who cannot pay this, he mu&s;t have &s;ome rich neighbours who can pay it for him; and it lies with each State to <HI>apportion</HI> their taxes in &s;uch manner as to <HI>ea&s;e the poor,</HI> and <HI>increa&s;e the &s;hare of the rich,</HI> &s;o as to bring the burden on all in due proportion to their abilities.</P>
<P>If, in&s;tead of this, the whole weight mu&s;t lie on a few, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> &s;uch as happen to have the &s;upplies nece&s;&s;ary for public u&s;e; if the wheat, hay, &amp;c. mu&s;t be <HI>torn from the farmer;</HI> the rum, &s;alt, &amp;c. from the <HI>merchant;</HI> the &s;er|vices of the <HI>&s;oldiers, waggoners,</HI> &amp;c. be <HI>compelled by force;</HI> if in this way our &s;upplies and &s;ervices are to be <HI>extorted from a few,</HI> whil&s;t the <HI>re&s;t</HI> bear nothing, the community
<PB N="101" REF="023972_0108_0FC2B59BC2A50C38">
mu&s;t &s;uffer much more than it would do, were the burden equally proportioned on all.</P>
<P>For to &s;ay nothing about the <HI>execrable inju&s;tice and wick|edne&s;s</HI> of this method, the <HI>re&s;entment and rage</HI> it will excite, the <HI>di&s;couragement to the future indu&s;try</HI> of the farmer, or <HI>adventure</HI> of the merchant, the <HI>reluctant recruits</HI> of the ar|my, hereby occa&s;ioned; to &s;ay nothing of the&s;e, it is as manife&s;t that a heavy burden may be borne by a whole community with more convenience than the &s;ame can be borne by a part only; as that a large beam of timber can be borne by 20 men, each bearing in proportion to his &s;trength, better than by 10 only who are cru&s;hed by the weight, whil&s;t the other 10 bear nothing, or perhaps &s;ome of them <HI>hang on and increa&s;e</HI> the weight. The 10 who are cru&s;hed and over&s;trained will be rendered unfit <HI>to bear any burden</HI> in future time, and of cour&s;e their future &s;ervices will be <HI>lo&s;t</HI> to the community; whereas if the whole 20 bore each his due proportion, it might be a heavy lift in|deed, but none of them would be <HI>over&s;trained,</HI> and they would all be <HI>fit</HI> for future &s;ervice.</P>
<P>II. <HI>Our currency is in &s;uch a feeble</HI> and <HI>fluctuating &s;tate, that the ends and u&s;es of it are much decayed, and in a manner lo&s;t; it cea&s;es</HI> to be a certain <HI>&s;ecurity</HI> to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of any <HI>determinate value,</HI> and of cour&s;e cannot be a common mea|&s;ure of value for other things; &s;o that it becomes impo&s;&s;i|ble to calculate or carry on our <HI>private bu&s;ine&s;s</HI> or <HI>public ope|rations</HI> with this medium, and of cour&s;e both mu&s;t cea&s;e, or be greatly impaired by this mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>This may be ea&s;ily and &s;peedily remedied by taxes; for if every bill of our currency was a <HI>Turki&s;h turban,</HI> we might ea&s;ily &s;et any price on it we plea&s;ed, and make the demand quick at that price, in this way; for was an ade|quate tax made, and &s;peedily and rigidly pre&s;&s;ed, obliging every man to pay a turban or 10 dollars into the public trea&s;ury, it is manife&s;t the price of a <HI>turban</HI> would imme|diately be 10 <HI>dollars,</HI> and the demand quick at that price. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, we may rai&s;e the value and demand for our currency to any pitch or degree we plea&s;e, in the &s;ame way, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> by making a tax for any &s;ufficient <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">um of
<PB N="102" REF="023972_0109_0FC2B5A2C1C87778">
continental dollars, or the value in hard money, at any ex|change we plea&s;e to fix. This would immediately rai&s;e the continental money up to that exchange, if the tax was large enough, and &s;ufficiently pre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Indeed we manife&s;tly have it in our power to increa&s;e the demand and value of our currency to a much <HI>higher degree</HI> in this way, than either the fixing the currency or the <HI>public exigencies</HI> require. This is a matter that requires great judgment and nicety of ob&s;ervation. Some may think there may be danger of oppre&s;&s;ion here; but I an|&s;wer there is neither danger nor po&s;&s;ibility of oppre&s;&s;ion, if the exchange is not fixed higher or lower than the cur|rent exchange or <HI>real pre&s;ent</HI> value, nor more money re|quired than is nece&s;&s;ary for the public u&s;e, and the States apportion the tax on their people properly according to their &s;everal abilities; all which ought to be very carefully at|tended to; and if any part is not <HI>done right,</HI> the fault will lie on <HI>tho&s;e that do it,</HI> but not at all on <HI>the principle</HI> here advanced.</P>
<P>But before we quit this idea, I beg leave to add one ob|&s;ervation more here, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> every hone&s;t individual, I con|ceive, <HI>lo&s;es more</HI> in a year by the pre&s;ent fluctuating &s;tate of our currency, and the pre&s;ent mode of procuring the public &s;upplies, than his <HI>whole tax</HI> would amount to; he <HI>lo&s;es his bu&s;ine&s;s</HI> on which the &s;upport of him&s;elf and fami|ly depends, and mu&s;t live on his dead &s;tock, or at lea&s;t is &s;ubjected to mo&s;t material di&s;advantage and di&s;courage|ment; for I &s;ubmit it to every man to judge, whether any man, either in the occupation of <HI>hu&s;bandry, mechanic arts, or merchandi&s;e,</HI> can compute his bu&s;ine&s;s in &s;uch a manner, as to make it &s;afe to put his <HI>whole &s;tock in action</HI> in any of the&s;e ways, while he has no <HI>rea&s;onable a&s;&s;urance</HI> what the produce of his diligence may be, or whether he may have <HI>the &s;elling</HI> his produce, fabrics, or merchandi&s;e, when he has procured them.</P>
<P>The <HI>occupations of life</HI> are of &s;uch <HI>great</HI> importance to every man, that it is manife&s;t that even &s;mall embarra&s;&s;|ments in them, involve a <HI>damage much greater</HI> than any man's <HI>tax would be</HI> to the whole expenditures of the war.
<PB N="103" REF="023972_0110_0FC2B5B2E64F05A8">
This opens to our view another actual circum&s;tance, ano|ther fact, which is too obvious to be overlooked, and too &s;erious and intere&s;ting to be neglected, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>
<P>III. <HI>The whole &s;ources of our &s;upplies are dying away fa&s;t, are le&s;&s;ening to an alarming degree, and threaten not a mere &s;carcity, but univer&s;al famine, want, and deficiency in a &s;hort time.</HI> Mo&s;t people are <HI>le&s;&s;ening the bu&s;ine&s;s</HI> of their &s;everal occupations down to a pitch ju&s;t &s;ufficient for their pre&s;ent occa&s;ions and nece&s;&s;ities, and many have wholly <HI>thrown up</HI> their occupations, and live on their <HI>dead &s;tock,</HI> and very few are calculating their bu&s;ine&s;s on any <HI>large &s;cale.</HI> I &s;ub|mit the truth of this to common ob&s;ervation. The pre&s;ent <HI>great demand</HI> for merchandi&s;e, fabrics, and the farmers' produce, which would be the <HI>&s;harpe&s;t &s;pur</HI> of indu&s;try, were our public coun&s;els wi&s;e, and our currency good, now becomes the <HI>terror of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors,</HI> and induces them to <HI>hide and conceal</HI> their effects, in&s;tead of <HI>expo&s;ing them in open market:</HI> our public acts (for taking &s;upplies by <HI>force)</HI> demon&s;trate this, for &s;uch acts are always &s;uppo&s;ed to <HI>be &s;uited to the circum&s;tances of the times.</HI></P>
<P>This is a direct and manife&s;t con&s;equence of the num|berle&s;s in&s;tances of <HI>force</HI> and <HI>fraud</HI> which have been prac|ti&s;ed to <HI>rob</HI> and <HI>cheat</HI> the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors out of their goods. The&s;e methods are in every view mad, wicked, and ab&s;urd; <HI>mad</HI> in tho&s;e who do not &s;ee the con&s;equences of them; <HI>wicked</HI> in tho&s;e who do &s;ee them; and <HI>ab&s;urd</HI> in both, be|cau&s;e by their natural operation they &s;oon <HI>defeat and de&s;troy the very ends</HI> for which they are adopted, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>mending the currency,</HI> and <HI>procuring &s;upplies.</HI></P>
<P>The great Creator has not given to all men equal di&s;|cernment; &s;ome politicians are &s;hort-&s;ighted, and cannot &s;ee the <HI>di&s;tant</HI> ill con&s;equences of mea&s;ures which yield a <HI>pre&s;ent advantage,</HI> but he mu&s;t be a <HI>&s;tupid blockhead</HI> who cannot &s;ee &s;uch effects when they <HI>&s;tare him in the face,</HI> and &s;tand in full fact <HI>before his eyes.</HI></P>
<P>The proper remedy of the&s;e terrible mi&s;chiefs is to lay the public burden equally on all by taxes; this is ea&s;ier, more rea&s;onable, and more &s;afe for the community, than to &s;uffer it to re&s;t upon a few. The burden mu&s;t be borne
<PB N="104" REF="023972_0111_0FC2B5B3DA2A6510">
by the community in &s;ome way; the &s;upplies and &s;ervices cannot be procured for nothing; we have too lately tried it out and out, and have full proof that <HI>&s;omething</HI> cannot be paid for with <HI>nothing,</HI> and therefore if &s;omething is to be paid for, it is vain and ridiculous to be ca&s;ting about, and &s;tarting and cha&s;ing one <HI>vi&s;ionary project</HI> after another, of <HI>new emi&s;&s;ions and better emi&s;&s;ions,</HI> of <HI>loans foreign and dome&s;tic,</HI> &amp;c. We mu&s;t recur to <HI>&s;olid wealth</HI> to pay for all our <HI>&s;olid &s;upplies.</HI> The nature of the &s;ubject will drive us to this at la&s;t, and the longer we put it off, the longer our mi&s;eries will increa&s;e; and God grant that we may not put it off till all remedy is de&s;perate.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t at la&s;t have recour&s;e to the &s;olid wealth of the States, and every individual mu&s;t be called on for his &s;hare. In this there can be no rea&s;on of complaint; the <HI>cry of op|pre&s;&s;ion</HI> will cea&s;e; that <HI>demand</HI> will be given to our curren|cy which <HI>is e&s;&s;ential to its nature and u&s;e;</HI> and every po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of &s;upplies will ha&s;ten to offer them: this will &s;timulate the indu&s;try of men of all occupations, and fill our country with virtue and plenty. But it may be objected here,</P>
<P N="1">1. That our old currency is got &s;o much out of repute, that it cannot be reformed, but may be <HI>called in,</HI> and re|placed with a <HI>new and better one.</HI> I an&s;wer, all that ails the old currency is, that it is not, it carries not in it, a &s;ufficient <HI>certain &s;ecurity</HI> of any determinate value to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or; and this &s;ame thing will all the <HI>new currency</HI> or <HI>any currency</HI> we can make, unle&s;s we can <HI>mend the public faith</HI> on which it depends, and <HI>connect</HI> it &s;o manife&s;tly and firmly with the <HI>real wealth</HI> of the States, that the <HI>&s;ecurity may be undoubted.</HI> It is impo&s;&s;ible this can be done by any thing but payment, either pre&s;ent or &s;o &s;ecured, that there will remain no doubt in the mind of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or that it will be <HI>bona fide</HI> made. If this can be done, there is no doubt but we may make our currency good, yea, better than hard money, becau&s;e it is <HI>&s;ooner counted,</HI> and more <HI>ea|&s;ily conveyed.</HI></P>
<P>There is indeed one rea&s;on for calling in the old curren|cy, and i&s;&s;uing a new one, which appears to me to have real and great weight, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Many of the bills of the pre|&s;ent

currency are <HI>counterfeited,</HI> and it is very nece&s;&s;ary the public &s;hould be freed from the&s;e impo&s;itions; and to this another may be added, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> It would be very de&s;irable to have a currency which &s;hould <HI>expre&s;s the true value</HI> of the bills in <HI>the face of them.</HI> The pre&s;ent bills carry but a <HI>for|tieth part</HI> of the value expre&s;&s;ed <HI>in their face;</HI> and this holds out the <HI>feeble, enervated,</HI> and <HI>debilitated &s;tate of our public credit</HI> in &s;o glaring a light, and publi&s;hes our <HI>&s;hame</HI> and <HI>di&s;tre&s;s</HI> &s;o very undeniably and univer&s;ally, that I &s;hould be willing to have them out of &s;ight; as people generally en|deavour to keep out of view, <HI>brands</HI> and <HI>marks</HI> which indi|cate the <HI>di&s;grace</HI> of their families.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, there is a &s;ort of deception in the bills, which I conceive to be hurtful; when a man gets a great bundle of them, he is apt to be cheated in &s;pite of the convictions of his own heart, into an opinion that he is <HI>richer</HI> than he is, and of cour&s;e to <HI>abate</HI> a little of that <HI>economy</HI> which he would think nece&s;&s;ary if his mind was not <HI>dilated</HI> by that delu&s;ion; whil&s;t, on the other hand, the taxes appear more <HI>heavy</HI> and <HI>terrible</HI> when heightened under the enormous de|nomination of the currency, than they would do were they offered and demanded in <HI>a &s;hape</HI> that corre&s;ponded to their real value.</P>
<P>The&s;e may perhaps by general con&s;ent be allowed good rea&s;ons for calling in the pre&s;ent bills and i&s;&s;uing new ones, and this may be well enough, if the mode and regulations of the mea&s;ure are limited to its u&s;es.</P>
<P>But the <HI>&s;ub&s;tance is yet wanting,</HI> every thing nece&s;&s;ary to give <HI>fixture</HI> to the currency is <HI>&s;till to be done,</HI> and <HI>all</HI> remains to be done, and will remain &s;o, till we can <HI>fix the funds</HI> of our currency &s;o &s;ure as to make it a <HI>certain &s;ecurity of real value</HI> to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, and call it in &s;o fa&s;t by taxes as to <HI>limit its quantity</HI> within the u&s;es of circulation, and prevent its increa&s;ing to &s;uch amount as to render the <HI>final redemp|tion difficult, improbable,</HI> or <HI>uncertain.</HI> This is the grand gift of the whole matter; this will effectually <HI>&s;ave</HI> us; <HI>le&s;s</HI> than this <HI>will not;</HI> all the <HI>re&s;t</HI> is but &s;hifting the weights in the &s;cale, without adding a &s;ingle ounce to help a balance or preponderation; this therefore is our great object, from

which our attention mu&s;t <HI>not be diverted,</HI> no, not <HI>for a mo|ment;</HI> on this our <HI>fate</HI> depends.</P>
<P N="2">2. It may be further objected, that no nation of <HI>Europe</HI> can carry on a war without loans, or &s;ome way anticipating their revenue, and running in debt, and how can it be &s;uppo&s;ed that we can do it otherwi&s;e? I an&s;wer, their ca&s;e differs from ours very materially.</P>
<P N="1">1. They have <HI>credit to borrow on,</HI> which we have not, unle&s;s we allow &s;uch a ruinous di&s;count as makes our affairs de&s;perate, and mu&s;t &s;oon put it out of our power to pre|&s;erve our liberty.</P>
<P N="2">2. Our country is <HI>richer,</HI> more full of <HI>men and &s;tores</HI> ne|ce&s;&s;ary in war, than tho&s;e of <HI>Europe</HI> in general, and of cour&s;e the carrying on the war without running in debt is more practicable by us, than by them.</P>
<P N="3">3. They have &s;uch &s;ure and e&s;tabli&s;hed <HI>&s;y&s;tems of finance fixed and &s;ettled,</HI> on which they can i&s;&s;ue internal bills, as furni&s;h a <HI>certain &s;ecurity</HI> to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, of payment; their trea&s;uries are the &s;afe&s;t repo&s;itories of their nation's wealth; we have not the&s;e advantages, our trea&s;ury has hitherto proved the <HI>de&s;truction of the wealth</HI> that has been <HI>tru&s;ted to it,</HI> and of cour&s;e every body is afraid of it, and therefore loaning at home to any great amount is impracticable, and what <HI>cannot be done</HI> need not be urged as <HI>politic, eligible</HI> or <HI>&s;alutary.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. If any nation of <HI>Europe</HI> borrows &s;pecie, and thereby <HI>increa&s;es</HI> and of cour&s;e <HI>depreciates</HI> their ca&s;h but 2 or 3 per cent. that di&s;count is enough <HI>to &s;pread it all over Europe,</HI> by which the balance is &s;oon re&s;tored, and the depreciation is checked; or if any nation, as <HI>Spain,</HI> imports money from <HI>Peru,</HI> and makes it over plenty and of reduced value, it &s;preads over <HI>Europe</HI> directly; and &s;o by covering a lar|ger &s;urface the depreciation becomes in&s;en&s;ible, and the in|convenience little felt; but this is not the ca&s;e with us; <HI>our currency cannot be exported,</HI> were it ever &s;o good, there|fore, any increa&s;e of quantity mu&s;t have its full effect by way of depreciation among our&s;elves; and of cour&s;e any <HI>increa&s;e of the quantity</HI> de&s;troys at once the very end and u&s;e of &s;uch increa&s;e, as the <HI>value</HI> cannot be thereby <HI>increa&s;ed,</HI>
<PB N="107" REF="023972_0114_0FC2B5B844284CF0">
but in&s;tead of this, the whole deluge of mi&s;chiefs ari&s;ing from a fluctuating currency mu&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">low in upon us.</P>
<P N="5">5. The very <HI>operation of this method of loaning, and anti|cipating</HI> of the revenue, adopted and practi&s;ed by the na|tions of <HI>Europe,</HI> is in it&s;elf enough, were it ever &s;o practi|cable by us, to deter us from following &s;o <HI>fatal an example.</HI> See Great-Britain enervated and benumbed under the pre&s;|&s;ure of an enormous debt, the very intere&s;t of which con|&s;umes the be&s;t part of the riche&s;t revenue which the wealth, indu&s;try, and oppre&s;&s;ion of the nation can produce. How di&s;heartening mu&s;t it be for that people to &s;truggle thro' the year merely to pay a corroding intere&s;t, which brings them <HI>not the nearer</HI> to the end of their mi&s;ery, but only <HI>keeps alive that gnawing vulture</HI> that mu&s;t <HI>for ever</HI> feed on their very entrails. I cannot but wonder that any man in his &s;en&s;es &s;hould hold up &s;uch a &s;ad &s;pectacle for an exam|ple to the <HI>Americans.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. The nations of <HI>Europe</HI> never attempt to borrow mo|ney, till they have fir&s;t <HI>rai&s;ed all the revenue they can within them&s;elves,</HI> and find it not &s;ufficient; but this is &s;o far from our ca&s;e, that we have <HI>never yet taxed half enough</HI> to drain off that &s;urplu&s;age of money which the war has occa&s;ion|ed, and our capital di&s;tre&s;&s;es and difficulties have all along ari&s;en from that <HI>flood of money</HI> which made it <HI>too plenty</HI> for u&s;e; even <HI>hard money</HI> will buy little more <HI>than half</HI> &s;o much country produce as it would purcha&s;e before the war.</P>
<P>This mi&s;chief cannot be remedied by <HI>increa&s;e of the quantity,</HI> by loans or any other way, but mu&s;t in its nature be checked by <HI>draining off</HI> and <HI>le&s;&s;ening that quantity,</HI> and thereby rai&s;ing the demand for it which is e&s;&s;ential to its u&s;e. From all this it appears to be weak and &s;illy as well as ab&s;urd, to urge for our imitation the example of other nations, the very convenience, nece&s;&s;ity, or even practica|bility of which depends on circum&s;tances which do not ap|ply at all to our ca&s;e.</P>
<P>It is not the lea&s;t danger of this practice that it <HI>operates in&s;en&s;ibly,</HI> &s;aps and mortgages our wealth before we know it; it operates like a <HI>&s;low poi&s;on,</HI> which is certain death, and more painful, tho' more &s;low and lingering, than the
<PB N="108" REF="023972_0115_0FC2B5D0897E7B20">
<HI>&s;udden execution</HI> of the ball or &s;word. Indeed I look on all <HI>in&s;en&s;ible taxes</HI> to be highly dangerous; a fatal <HI>in&s;tance of which</HI> we have in the <HI>depreciation</HI> of our own currency. I think it nece&s;&s;ary that the people &s;hould <HI>&s;ee and feel</HI> what they pay, &s;hould earn the money before it is &s;pent; this would prevent a thou&s;and <HI>&s;tupid, fooli&s;h,</HI> and <HI>needle&s;s ways of &s;pending the public money;</HI> this would make the rulers careful how they adopt any <HI>expen&s;ive operations,</HI> and atten|tive to the &s;tricte&s;t <HI>economy</HI> in the expenditure.</P>
<P><HI>In&s;en&s;ible taxes</HI> are like <HI>in&s;en&s;ible per&s;piration,</HI> which <HI>weak|ens</HI> the body, and <HI>wa&s;tes</HI> the con&s;titution before the pa|tient knows he is &s;ick. Nature generally marks places of danger with &s;ignals of notice, and every mariner looks on one &s;unken rock as more dangerous than twenty that are above water; for this rea&s;on I think that every branch of the revenue &s;hould originate in &s;uch &s;en&s;ible and vi&s;ible de|mands on the wealth of the people, that they may all feel and know <HI>what they pay,</HI> and what they <HI>pay it for;</HI> and this is, in my opinion, the &s;ure&s;t way to keep a <HI>trea&s;ury al|ways &s;upplied</HI> with enough by the cheerful contributions of the people, when the public &s;afety or convenience re|quires it, and to prevent <HI>more than enough</HI> being ever de|manded or granted: a due attention to both the&s;e I take to be no &s;mall <HI>branch</HI> or even <HI>pillar of policy</HI> in every &s;tate. The foregoing &s;urvey of our mi&s;chiefs and remedies brings up to view another circum&s;tance which appears to me a very plain fact, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>
<P>IV. Our di&s;tre&s;&s;es, dangers, and difficulties do not con|&s;i&s;t in a <HI>want of any thing,</HI> but in <HI>over plenty,</HI> in &s;urplu&s;age of ca&s;h, which is become &s;o common and ea&s;y of acquire|ment, that it is &s;lighted, it is little thought of, it is &s;carce an object of <HI>de&s;ire,</HI> much le&s;s of <HI>animation;</HI> our burdens are burdens <HI>of ca&s;h,</HI> that which is the <HI>wi&s;h</HI> and <HI>want</HI> of mo&s;t other di&s;tre&s;&s;ed people is <HI>our mi&s;ery;</HI> like plethoric con&s;titutions, who&s;e <HI>&s;tamina are all good,</HI> but are <HI>overloaded</HI> with too much blood. A &s;ufficient bleeding, a proper <HI>draining off</HI> of this &s;uperfluous matter, would &s;et us all right in a &s;hort time, and every part of the con&s;titution would find <HI>ea&s;e, relief,</HI> and a <HI>&s;peedy return of life</HI> and <HI>vigor</HI>
<PB N="109" REF="023972_0116_0FC2B5D292AFE3C8">
from the &s;imple operation of this mo&s;t obvious, natural re|medy. On the whole matter, I think that one more fact offers it&s;elf to view, which were we in a <HI>le&s;s torpid &s;tate,</HI> might animate us to &s;ome &s;pirited efforts, &s;ome lively ex|ertions to extricate our&s;elves from di&s;tre&s;s and danger, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>
<P>V. Every circum&s;tance con&s;pires to demon&s;trate that the <HI>mo&s;t &s;ure and effectual remedies are in our own power,</HI> are <HI>ve|ry practicable, and the pre&s;ent time</HI> is the <HI>mo&s;t &s;uitable for the application of them</HI> that any nation in di&s;tre&s;s ever had or could wi&s;h. We are <HI>free of debt,</HI> at lea&s;t of the <HI>pre&s;&s;ures</HI> of debt; the whole public debt at home and abroad does not exceed our abilities, and may be paid in two or three years without any painful exertions. We are yet <HI>on this &s;ide of that bottomle&s;s aby&s;s of debt,</HI> into which our enemies find them&s;elves plunged; that in&s;upportable but everla&s;ting burden that pre&s;&s;es and exhau&s;ts them in &s;o fatal a manner, that they are become the &s;port of their enemies and neglect of their friends; none appears for them in this their day of di&s;tre&s;s.</P>

I do not pretend to be adequate to &s;uch a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and &s;hall only beg leave to make a few remarks on it; and this I am induced to do at this time, becau&s;e the act is but lately publi&s;hed, and our people have not had time to make up their minds on it, and I conceive many per&s;ons mi&s;ap|prehend the real de&s;ign and true con&s;truction of it.</P>

<P>I do not conceive it to be the de&s;ign of Congre&s;s that <HI>any part of the new bills &s;hall i&s;&s;ue at all,</HI> if it &s;hall be found that it cannot be done <HI>at their full value,</HI> without <HI>any depreciation;</HI> or that they &s;hall i&s;&s;ue <HI>any fa&s;ter,</HI> or to any <HI>larger amount</HI> than can be done, without any <HI>depreciation;</HI> for I can by no means admit the &s;uppo&s;ition, that the new bills are to be i&s;&s;ued in <HI>a depreciated &s;tate,</HI> becau&s;e that very depreciation <HI>defeats their u&s;e,</HI> renders them in&s;ufficient for the procurement of &s;upplies, and involves us over again in the <HI>mi&s;eries of a fluctuating currency,</HI> whil&s;t we are at the
<PB N="113" REF="023972_0120_0FC2B5D8AF68D740">
&s;ame time loaded with a va&s;t debt of hard money <HI>to pay the intere&s;t of them.</HI> I never doubted the integrity of Congre&s;s, and therefore cannot attribute to them &s;uch ab&s;urdity of de&s;ign, even tho' the letter of their act might admit &s;uch a ruinous and ab&s;urd con&s;truction.</P>
<P>They re&s;erve, in their act, 4, <HI>tenths of the new bills for their own di&s;po&s;al,</HI> which they will doubtle&s;s <HI>i&s;&s;ue in a man|ner &s;afe</HI> and <HI>u&s;eful</HI> to the States; whil&s;t the other 6 <HI>tenths</HI> are left to the di&s;cretion of the States, who have every in|ducement to a <HI>prudent i&s;&s;ue of them,</HI> as each &s;tate will &s;tand bound to redeem both principal and intere&s;t of all they &s;hall i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>I am further told, that the Congre&s;s have it in contem|plation <HI>to appoint a Financier-General, of known gravity, judgment, and economy,</HI> to <HI>&s;uperintend</HI> this great department, who can either <HI>let out</HI> or <HI>withhold</HI> the i&s;&s;ues in &s;uch manner as to give the bills all the <HI>effect</HI> and <HI>u&s;e</HI> their nature will ad|mit, without <HI>overloading</HI> the public credit, or <HI>increa&s;ing the quantity</HI> &s;o far as to <HI>le&s;&s;en their demand,</HI> and, by that means, <HI>lo&s;e the whole benefit</HI> by gra&s;ping at too much. This error is &s;o fatal and recent, and the apprehen&s;ions of the people <HI>wound up to &s;uch a pitch of alarm,</HI> that I much doubt if <HI>half</HI> the propo&s;ed quantity of the new bills can be i&s;&s;ued <HI>without a &s;en&s;ible depreciation;</HI> but experience will be&s;t &s;how this, and prudence at the time mu&s;t dictate the <HI>practicable degree</HI> which may be ventured on; and it is my opinion, that no po&s;&s;ible height of public nece&s;&s;ity can <HI>ju&s;tify exceed|ing &s;uch degree,</HI> becau&s;e that exce&s;s is a &s;ure way to defeat the u&s;es of the currency, and of cour&s;e to increa&s;e the public nece&s;&s;ities, let them be ever &s;o high before.</P>
<P>The exchange is a &s;ure barometer of the public credit, as it is of the trade, and will always &s;erve as a &s;afe moni|tor and guide to our coun&s;els of revenue. It is the <HI>vaine&s;t of all vanities</HI> to imagine that a public bill is <HI>worth a dollar</HI> when it <HI>will not bring it,</HI> or that it is <HI>worth any more than it will bring.</HI> If it &s;hall be &s;ound on trial that any larger &s;um than I have &s;uppo&s;ed, or that the whole 10,000,000 can be i&s;&s;ued without depreciation, the public may &s;afely receive the benefit of the whole; and the addition of the
<PB N="114" REF="023972_0121_0FC2B5F49C433AC0">
intere&s;t, which will be received by every individual that holds the bills, will compen&s;ate for the increa&s;e of his taxes to pay it.</P>
<P>This matter cannot be computed on with any exactne&s;s, without knowing the <HI>whole amount of the current ca&s;h of the Thirteen States,</HI> which I have not yet &s;een any where a&s;|certained. I have heretofore on a few data made a &s;ort of loo&s;e, rough computation of it, to be about 12,000,000 <HI>of hard dollars;</HI> but I have of late been collecting documents for a more exact calculation, and on a nearer view am in|duced to believe the amount will rather fall <HI>&s;hort of that &s;um,</HI> and perhaps very con&s;iderably; and I think farther, it is very manife&s;t that we mu&s;t have a <HI>promi&s;cuous circu|lation</HI> of both <HI>hard money</HI> and <HI>paper,</HI> in order to keep the <HI>exchange of them equal:</HI> but this by the bye.</P>
<P N="4">4. It may be further objected to this act, that we can have no &s;ecurity that <HI>&s;ome nece&s;&s;ity or other</HI> will not be urged next year to make a <HI>further addition to the emi&s;&s;ions</HI> of cir|culating bills, till they <HI>will depreciate.</HI></P>
<P>But in an&s;wer to this, I am clearly of opinion, Congre&s;s will not be able to i&s;&s;ue <HI>the whole</HI> 10,000,000 already voted <HI>without a depreciation;</HI> and al&s;o, that they will not dare to i&s;&s;ue <HI>any of it in a depreciated &s;tate;</HI> this will &s;o manife&s;tly and immediately <HI>ruin the u&s;e of the whole,</HI> and defeat its <HI>whole purpo&s;e,</HI> and bring on afre&s;h the mi&s;chiefs of a <HI>fluc|tuating currency,</HI> that I can have no idea that any men in their &s;en&s;es can think of adopting it.</P>
<P>But if we are to &s;uppo&s;e our wi&s;e&s;t men capable of &s;uch <HI>idle frenzy,</HI> it is needle&s;s to rea&s;on any further about it, we may as well give up <HI>all u&s;e of our intellects,</HI> and follow where wild di&s;traction roves, and take the fate which a concour&s;e of <HI>whim and accident</HI> &s;hall provide for us: but I augur better things; I am full of expectation that before our affairs come to this pa&s;s, our wi&s;e&s;t men, both in Con|gre&s;s and State-A&s;&s;emblies, will be convinced of one great truth, dictated by nature and our pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>that we mu&s;t pay our expenditures as we go:</HI> and this is the only practicable method before us; this will make any &s;cheme good, which is not wretched indeed, and without
<PB N="115" REF="023972_0122_0FC2B5F5EAAD2FA8">
this, every devi&s;able &s;cheme is but whim, vi&s;ion, and frenzy.</P>
<P N="5">5. The &s;um of 10,000,000 is not more than the States are able to make <HI>the mo&s;t &s;ufficient</HI> and <HI>undoubted &s;ecurity for,</HI> if they plea&s;e. But let that &s;ecurity be ever &s;o good; to give it a currency, and prevent a depreciation, they mu&s;t rai&s;e a demand for it by general taxes. The&s;e are recom|mended by Congre&s;s in their act of the 18th in&s;tant, and others foregoing; and were they put under rigid col|lection by all the States, we might judge whether the de|mand thereby rai&s;ed was &s;ufficient to give life and u&s;e to the currency; if it &s;hould not be &s;o, it is nece&s;&s;ary that the taxes be &s;till increa&s;ed till that effect &s;hall appear, at which time, and not before, the grand point will be gain|ed, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that of fixing our currency. We &s;hall then have the two great things nece&s;&s;ary to fix any paper currency, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>good funds,</HI> which may give the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or a certain &s;e|curity; and a <HI>quick demand</HI> and circulation of the currency it&s;elf.</P>
<P N="6">6. It appears then, that if the &s;aid act was put into proper and wi&s;e execution, duly limited and &s;ufficiently vi|gorous, it will an&s;wer the great and important ends ex|pected from it; and tho' it may not be thought the <HI>be&s;t po&s;&s;ible,</HI> yet as it appears to be &s;ufficient for its purpo&s;e, were it duly put into operation, and properly &s;upported, I think it clear that the States ought not to <HI>he&s;itate adopting</HI> it, nor <HI>&s;tarve</HI> it by too languid and dilatory movements; the be&s;t plan po&s;&s;ible may be rendered u&s;ele&s;s and ineffectu|al this way; wi&s;dom and deci&s;ion in coun&s;el are not more nece&s;&s;ary in any important plans of this &s;ort, than vigor in execution.</P>
<P>I do not con&s;ider the act &s;o much a &s;cheme of increa&s;ing the revenue as of fixing the currency; but if it is to in|clude both, the fir&s;t certainly depends on the <HI>la&s;t,</HI> and <HI>is limited by it;</HI> for Congre&s;s cannot think of i&s;&s;uing any part of the new bills in a depreciated &s;tate; they mu&s;t fix their value, or it is idle, dangerous, and ineffectual to the la&s;t degree to i&s;&s;ue them; if they can be i&s;&s;ued in a fixed &s;tate, yet no more of them can be i&s;&s;ued than can be kept

in a fixed &s;tate; for to exceed this limit, will be to de&s;troy their whole u&s;e at once, and involve us in more di&s;tre&s;s than before. I look on it a <HI>very bold &s;tep</HI> to put the revenue on &s;uch <HI>a ri&s;k;</HI> but I &s;uppo&s;e the public nece&s;&s;ities require it, and of this the Congre&s;s are the be&s;t judges, and doubt|le&s;s acted on more rea&s;ons than we out of doors can &s;ee.</P>
<P>The fixing the currency, and <HI>incomes of revenue</HI> are of of the la&s;t con&s;equence to us all in the pre&s;ent cri&s;is; and therefore it appears to me ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that every State &s;hould exert them&s;elves in the mo&s;t &s;peedy and effec|tual manner to give &s;anction and force to this act, le&s;t, by their defect, the important chance &s;hould turn again&s;t us, and we &s;hould be left without revenue or currency at this critical time, when our <HI>political exi&s;tence,</HI> as well as the <HI>oc|cupation</HI> and <HI>means of living</HI> of every individual, <HI>depend on both.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In my Fourth E&s;&s;ay on Trade and Finance, publi&s;hed <HI>Feb.</HI> 10, 1780&punc; I calculated the exchange of Continental money at that time to be 40 for 1, and &s;trongly urged the <HI>fixture</HI> of it at that exchange, that the fatal mi&s;|chiefs of a <HI>fluctuating</HI> currency, either by appreciation or depreciation, might be avoided.</P>
<P>From this I &s;uppo&s;e that &s;ome people have &s;urmi&s;ed that the <HI>fir&s;t idea and original plan</HI> of this act was <HI>formed</HI> by me and <HI>&s;ugge&s;ted</HI> to Congre&s;s, and my opinion here expre&s;&s;ed, "that the States ought to adopt it without he&s;ita|tion," confirms their conjecture: this induces me to ob&s;erve &s;ome things on this matter, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>
<P N="1">1. This act was not the ab&s;urd, inefficient, and ridiculous thing, which &s;ome people have repre&s;ented it to be; there was <HI>no error in its principle;</HI> it wanted nothing to complete its purpo&s;es but <HI>decided &s;upport</HI> and <HI>effectual execution.</HI> The <HI>taxes then in&s;tituted</HI> by Congre&s;s, with the arrearages of for|mer requi&s;itions, would have been (if punctually paid) &s;ufficient to <HI>call in every bill</HI> of the old money, and a <HI>large &s;um</HI> of the <HI>new bills,</HI> in the cour&s;e of one year, and would doubtle&s;s have rai&s;ed &s;uch a demand for what re|mained, as would have <HI>kept up its value,</HI> and prevented any depreciation.</P>
<P>Yet, 2d, I did <HI>not approve</HI> of it, but in all conver&s;ations I had with Mem|bers of Congre&s;s, whil&s;t it was under debate, I con&s;tantly <HI>oppo&s;ed it;</HI> princi|pally becau&s;e I did not expect, as the &s;tate of things then was, that it would receive that <HI>&s;upport and vigorous execution</HI> which was nece&s;&s;ary to give it a due effect.</P>
<P>The people of the States at that time had been worried and fretted, di&s;|appointed and put out of humor by &s;o many <HI>tender-acts, limitations of prices,</HI> and other <HI>compul&s;ory methods to force value into paper money,</HI> and <HI>compel the cir|culation of it,</HI> and by &s;o many vain <HI>funding &s;chemes, declarations,</HI> and <HI>promi&s;es,</HI> all which i&s;&s;ued from Congre&s;s, but <HI>died under the mo&s;t zealous efforts to put them into operation</HI> and <HI>effect,</HI> that their patience was all exhau&s;ted; I &s;ay, the&s;e <HI>irritations</HI> and <HI>di&s;appointments</HI> had &s;o de&s;troyed the <HI>courage</HI> and <HI>confidence</HI> of the people, that they appeared <HI>heartle&s;s</HI> and almo&s;t <HI>&s;tupid</HI> when their at|tention was called to any <HI>new propo&s;itions.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides all this, I had objections to &s;everal clau&s;es of the act, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> our people were pretty well accu&s;tomed to the old bills (bad as they were) but to <HI>call them all in,</HI> and &s;ub&s;titute <HI>a new &s;ort</HI> in their &s;tead, I thought would be a <HI>novelty</HI> that might have danger in it; at lea&s;t, it would require great <HI>expen&s;e, time,</HI> &amp;c. and all to very little u&s;e or benefit; for the <HI>&s;ame ener|gy of taxation</HI> ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to <HI>&s;upport the credit of the new bills,</HI> would be quite &s;ufficient to make <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> for the old ones</HI> as would prevent their further <HI>depreciation,</HI> and receiving hard money in their &s;tead at 40 for 1. would prevent their <HI>appreciation.</HI></P>
<P>I could not &s;ee any benefit in <HI>the &s;ignature of the States,</HI> and feared this might bring <HI>into doubt</HI> the full <HI>powers</HI> of Congre&s;s to i&s;&s;ue bills, or do any other like acts under their <HI>own &s;ignature.</HI></P>
<P>Nor could I &s;ee any advantage ari&s;ing from the <HI>intere&s;t</HI> annexed to the bills; it being payable <HI>&s;ix years afterwards</HI> would create mighty little in|ducement to their <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> circulation; but if the bills &s;ucceeded, this would greatly <HI>increa&s;e the price</HI> of their <HI>final</HI> redemption.</P>
<P>But I had another material objection to the act; for when I calculated the exchange, <HI>Feb.</HI> 10, 1780, it was really 40 to 1; but when this act pa&s;&s;ed, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the 18th of <HI>March</HI> following, the exchange had increa&s;ed to 60 for 1, and con&s;equently, all the provi&s;ions of the act which related to the exchange, became e&s;&s;entially wrong, and of cour&s;e rendered the act it&s;elf utterly impracticable, without new provi&s;ions conformable to the exchange which really exi&s;ted at the time, or making all the requi&s;itions of the act in hard money or Continental bills of the &s;ame value, <HI>i. e.</HI> at any exchange that &s;hould exi&s;t at the time of payment.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding all this, when the bill was actually <HI>pa&s;t,</HI> and the <HI>revenues and &s;upplies</HI> of the year depended on <HI>its &s;ucce&s;s,</HI> I readily offered my little mite of aid to give it an effectual operation, as I &s;uppo&s;e any Member of Congre&s;s would and ought to do, <HI>when it was pa&s;t,</HI> tho' he oppo&s;ed it in every &s;tage, <HI>whil&s;t under debate.</HI></P></NOTE></P>

The tax demanded will amount to about 4 <HI>hard dol|lars</HI> in a year to each per&s;on in the States, or 20 &s;uch dollars, or the value of them, to a middling family of 5 per&s;ons; and this will, by the due apportionment of the tax, be <HI>le&s;&s;ened</HI> to the <HI>poor</HI> and <HI>increa&s;ed</HI> to the <HI>rich,</HI> in pro|portion to their abilities. This is the <HI>height</HI> of it; this is the wor&s;t that can happen; this is the <HI>dreadful price</HI> de|manded for our <HI>&s;alvation,</HI> to &s;ave us from &s;ure de&s;truction, and which the Thirteen States are deeply <HI>he&s;itating</HI> and <HI>contemplating</HI> whether they <HI>will pay or no;</HI> at lea&s;t this tax is what the <HI>Congre&s;s</HI> are he&s;itating to <HI>recommend,</HI> and the <HI>States</HI> to <HI>levy</HI> and <HI>collect,</HI> tho' I doubt if the people would he&s;itate a moment to pay it, if it was put under collection, e&s;pecially if it was demanded in monthly rates, which would render the payment much more practicable than it would be, if it was all called for at one payment. Now we will con&s;ider what is lo&s;t for want of this tax.</P>
<P N="1">1. Every indu&s;trious man lo&s;es his <HI>bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI> his <HI>occupation,</HI> or at lea&s;t finds it <HI>greatly embarra&s;&s;ed,</HI> and &s;ubjected to great difficulty and di&s;couragement: for, I &s;ubmit it to every man to judge, whether, in the pre&s;ent <HI>fluctuating &s;tate of the currency</HI> and mode of <HI>procuring the public &s;upplies,</HI> whe|ther, I &s;ay, it can be <HI>&s;afe or prudent</HI> for any man to lay out any bu&s;ine&s;s of hu&s;bandry, mechanic arts, or merchandi&s;e, <HI>on any large &s;cale,</HI> whil&s;t he knows not <HI>what he mu&s;t &s;ell his proceeds for</HI> when he has got them, or whether he may <HI>have the &s;elling of them at all or not?</HI> The&s;e embarra&s;&s;|ments are very <HI>&s;en&s;ibly felt</HI> thro' the States, but would all vani&s;h, if our finances were re&s;tored. And I think it very plain, that a man's occupation mu&s;t be very poor indeed,
<PB N="121" REF="023972_0128_0FC2B626D5F7A458">
if the&s;e embarra&s;&s;ments are not more <HI>damage</HI> to him, than his <HI>whole tax would amount to.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. For want of the tax, <HI>the &s;upplies of the country are daily le&s;&s;ening, our plenty wa&s;tes away fa&s;t,</HI> and <HI>&s;carcity</HI> and <HI>want</HI> are &s;ucceeding in the place of them. This makes every man's e&s;tate in the country <HI>le&s;s valuable,</HI> as it is ap|parent that an e&s;tate in a country of <HI>poverty and want,</HI> is not &s;o good, or worth &s;o much money, as the &s;ame e&s;tate would be in a country <HI>full of riches and plentiful &s;upplies. All means of living</HI> will of cour&s;e become harder to be obtained, as it is more difficult procuring &s;upplies in a coun|try where <HI>they are &s;carce,</HI> than in one where they <HI>are plenty.</HI> What may be the amount of <HI>lo&s;s</HI> to each individual from the&s;e cau&s;es, is not ea&s;y to calculate; but as they affect the <HI>whole bulk of e&s;tates,</HI> and operate on the <HI>whole means of livelihood,</HI> they cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed <HI>&s;mall,</HI> and I think will readily be allowed to <HI>exceed</HI> any man's <HI>&s;hare</HI> of the <HI>tax</HI> ne|ce&s;&s;ary to <HI>prevent them.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. For want of the tax, <HI>the morality and indu&s;try of the people are greatly dimini&s;hed. Frauds, cheats,</HI> and <HI>gro&s;s di&s;|hone&s;ty</HI> are introduced, and a thou&s;and <HI>idle ways of living</HI> are attempted in the room of that hone&s;t <HI>indu&s;try, economy,</HI> and <HI>diligence</HI> which heretofore <HI>ble&s;&s;ed</HI> and <HI>enriched</HI> this coun|try. And as an e&s;tate in a country of <HI>hone&s;t,</HI> indu&s;trious people, is better than in one filled with <HI>idle rogues;</HI> and as all property is hereby rendered more un&s;afe and le&s;s valua|ble; it is very ea&s;y to &s;ee, that the <HI>lo&s;s</HI> of each individual in this re&s;pect, will be very con&s;iderable, and mu&s;t, on a very moderate computation, much <HI>exceed the tax</HI> required to <HI>remedy the whole mi&s;chief.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. For want of the tax, our <HI>trade is decaying fa&s;t;</HI> and this not only ruins the merchant, and renders the procure|ment of &s;uch nece&s;&s;aries as are u&s;ually &s;upplied by our trade, more dear and difficult, but it <HI>enervates the whole &s;y&s;tem both of hu&s;bandry</HI> and <HI>mechanic arts,</HI> as the&s;e can never flouri&s;h <HI>without a market,</HI> where the produce of the farmer and the fabrics of the mechanic may be &s;old, when ready for &s;ale. This affects the whole country in a mo&s;t ma|terial manner, and mu&s;t at lea&s;t involve each individual in
<PB N="122" REF="023972_0129_0FC2B62DF8A115E8">
a <HI>lo&s;s</HI> of more than his <HI>tax would amount to,</HI> &s;ufficient to give a fixed value and u&s;e to our currency, and thereby re&s;tore our trade and hu&s;bandry to their former vigor.</P>
<P N="5">5. For want of the tax our <HI>defence mu&s;t cea&s;e,</HI> and we mu&s;t <HI>lie open to the ravages</HI> and <HI>plunders of our enemies;</HI> the very ri&s;k and danger of which involves many di&s;tre&s;&s;es that mu&s;t occa&s;ion <HI>lo&s;s</HI> to every individual, far greater than the whole amount of his tax would be towards &s;uch defence as would render the country quite &s;afe and &s;ecure. Add to this, the danger of being finally <HI>overrun</HI> and <HI>conquered</HI> by our enemies, and falling under their unre&s;trained power; in which ca&s;e, they would doubtle&s;s extort <HI>perpetual</HI> taxes from us, to as great amount as are now required for <HI>a &s;hort time</HI> to &s;ecure us again&s;t their power.</P>
<P N="6">6. The want of this tax <HI>enervates our laws,</HI> renders their fines, penalties, and forfeitures uncertain and ineffectual; de&s;troys the &s;alaries, fees, and rewards of our civil and re|ligious officers, and of cour&s;e prevents men of abilities from &s;erving in the character of judge, &s;heriff, go&s;pel-mini&s;ter, &s;choolma&s;ter, &amp;c. and of cour&s;e the whole <HI>&s;y&s;tem of our civil and religious polity, and education of youth is clearly on the decline</HI> to a very dangerous degree; but as all the&s;e in&s;titutions tend much to the happine&s;s of &s;ociety, any de|cline of them mu&s;t greatly <HI>prejudice the value of every e&s;tate,</HI> and the pro&s;pects of happine&s;s and utility ari&s;ing from it, to an amount greatly <HI>beyond the tax required</HI> to &s;ecure all the&s;e whole&s;ome in&s;titutions in their fulle&s;t u&s;e, re&s;pectabi|lity, and general influence.</P>
<P>I might add here more in&s;tances of lo&s;s incurred by in|dividuals from the fluctuating &s;tate of our currency and di&s;orders of our finances, which would be all remedied by the tax I recommend; but it appears to me, tho&s;e already adduced are grounded on &s;uch obvious and notorious facts, are of &s;uch intere&s;ting concern, and of &s;uch forcible con|clu&s;ion, that if they do not convince, it is needle&s;s to offer more on the &s;ubject; it is vain to <HI>offer arguments</HI> to people who will not give a <HI>&s;hilling to &s;ave a pound;</HI> and yet this is much more than the tax I propo&s;e, requires, however it may be <HI>aggravated and heightened</HI> by &s;tingy, timorous,
<PB N="123" REF="023972_0130_0FC2B640FAD6DDC0">
or corrupted men, into an <HI>exorbitancy</HI> utterly in&s;upport|able.</P>
<P>II. As the money collected by taxes, or other money to the amount will be con&s;tantly i&s;&s;uing, the payment of hea|vy taxes will be rendered as ea&s;y as the nature of the ca&s;e admits; while at the &s;ame time the great demand for money occa&s;ioned by the tax, will be &s;ufficient to keep its value fixed, and its u&s;es well &s;ecured and pre&s;erved. The faci|lity of rai&s;ing &s;ums of money when the circulation is bri&s;k, and the demand quick for goods on hands, is ea&s;ily con|ceived, by any per&s;on in the lea&s;t acquainted with trade. This mightily le&s;&s;ens the burden of the tax below what it would be, if collected in a dull time of bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;car|city of ca&s;h, and con&s;equently the tax it&s;elf becomes le&s;s &s;en&s;ibly felt under the&s;e favorable circum&s;tances of ea&s;y procurement, than the &s;ame would be, if deferred to &s;ome future time, when there might be le&s;s demand for goods, and greater &s;carcity of ca&s;h; therefore it is the intere&s;t of every individual to pay his dues to the public whil&s;t he can do it with the greate&s;t ea&s;e, rather than defer it to &s;ome future time, when he may happen to be called on for it at a juncture when the payment will be more difficult and di|&s;tre&s;&s;ing than now.</P>
<P>III. The price of mo&s;t kinds of country produce is <HI>much higher</HI> than it is u&s;ually in times of general quiet, and there|fore <HI>the tax may be paid</HI> much <HI>ea&s;ier</HI> now than then; as a bu|&s;hel of wheat, a cow, a &s;heep, &amp;c. will bring <HI>much more</HI> now than it will do when quiet is again re&s;tored, and of cour&s;e ought to be &s;old now, that the payment may be made whil&s;t it can be done with mo&s;t ea&s;e and advantage; for <HI>what is not paid now mu&s;t lie as a debt</HI> to be paid in future time, when it will probably take near <HI>a double quantity</HI> of wheat, beef, mutton, park, &amp;c. to pay it, as would now be &s;uf|ficient.</P>
<P>IV. Further, a prudent man will never let a demand <HI>lie again&s;t him</HI> when he can <HI>conveniently &s;atisfy it;</HI> and a public debt is the wor&s;t of all kind of demands, when a man is not ready for them; for I &s;ubmit it to every man if he would not &s;ee <HI>any &s;ort of creditor</HI> come to him when he was
<PB N="124" REF="023972_0131_0FC2B6425AD245A0">
unprepared to pay, rather than <HI>a public collector. Pre&s;ent payment</HI> avoids all this trouble and mortification, as well as <HI>&s;aves much</HI> by the high price which that produce will now bring, which mu&s;t be &s;old to pay the tax.</P>
<P>V. The tax will procure a good market, and &s;ure, &s;uffi|cient payment to individuals who have &s;uch articles for &s;ale as are needed by the public; whereas for want of the tax, thou&s;ands who have &s;old their goods to the public, have been paid in a u&s;ele&s;s currency, or have not been able to get any payment at all, to their great di&s;appointment and damage. This is a con&s;ideration of great importance to mo&s;t people in the States, as there are few who would not choo&s;e to &s;upply the public with &s;ome kind of goods or &s;ervices in their power, if they could be &s;ure of punctual and &s;uffici|ent payment. The having a quick and profitable market for what is made ready for &s;ale, is no &s;mall advantage to every individual; for without this all his goods which he does not need for his own con&s;umption, lie u&s;ele&s;s on his hands, or his time may be lo&s;t for want of an employer, who would pay him for his &s;ervices.</P>
<P>The <HI>advantages</HI> re&s;ulting from this <HI>one circum&s;tance</HI> would be equal to the tax to many thou&s;ands of individuals; as the goods or time they would <HI>lo&s;e</HI> for want of a market or em|ployers, would be more than equal to the <HI>tax,</HI> as they have experienced to their &s;orrow, who have lo&s;t their goods for want of a market, or &s;old them where they could not get their payment either in due time, or in currency of certain value.</P>
<P>VI. The tax would remove all cau&s;e of complaint, and put an end to the great oppre&s;&s;ion which has taken place much too long; for if the burden is laid equally on all, no one can have any cau&s;e to complain of oppre&s;&s;ion when his &s;hare is demanded; but without this the &s;upplies want|ed for the public mu&s;t be taken by force or fraud from the owners, without payment, to their great oppre&s;&s;ion and in|jury. Indeed if &s;upplies are not procured and &s;ent to the army, the&s;e oppre&s;&s;ions mu&s;t be multiplied to a very tragi|cal degree; for to di&s;band the army and &s;end them home, when their pre&s;ent &s;upplies are &s;pent, will not probably be
<PB N="125" REF="023972_0132_0FC2B643E153F798">
either &s;afe for the country, or agreeable to them; they mu&s;t therefore live in free quarters; they will probably be directed to march into &s;uch States and towns as have been mo&s;t deficient in furni&s;hing their quotas: but even in that ca&s;e, thou&s;ands of individuals will &s;uffer, who have not been guilty of any deficiency or delays; for in ca&s;es of &s;uch extremity, the innocent mu&s;t be involved with the guilty, and of cour&s;e oppre&s;&s;ions mu&s;t be infinite, and very terrible. The burden of the tax bears no proportion to the ruinous and mo&s;t dreadful effects re&s;ulting in this one in&s;tance from the want of it.</P>
<P>VII. The tax in a few months will <HI>re&s;tore our finances, fix our currency,</HI> and put us in condition <HI>to unite</HI> our force with every <HI>po&s;&s;ible advantage;</HI> and this will &s;o clearly de|mon&s;trate our unbroken &s;trength, union, and firmne&s;s, that the <HI>hearts</HI> of our enemies <HI>will die</HI> within them, and they will &s;oon break up and leave us in de&s;pair. Their <HI>only hope</HI> of conque&s;t has long been from the <HI>confu&s;ions of our fi|nances;</HI> they have not attempted for two years pa&s;t <HI>to oppo&s;e their capital force to ours,</HI> but have hung on us in hopes that we &s;hould <HI>&s;oon &s;ink under the pre&s;&s;ure of our own expen&s;es,</HI> and &s;o fall an ea&s;y prey into their hands; and they will con|tinue in this hope as long as they &s;ee us <HI>ringing the changes on vi&s;ionary &s;chemes,</HI> and trying in <HI>new &s;hapes and attitudes</HI> an <HI>old delu&s;ion,</HI> that always <HI>has deceived</HI> us in every &s;hape, and probably <HI>always will.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Nov.</HI> 19, 1779, Congre&s;s earne&s;tly recommended to the &s;everal States, <Q>forthwith to <HI>enact laws</HI> for a <HI>general limitation of prices,</HI> to commence from the 1<HI>&s;t day of Feb.</HI> (then) next,</Q> on the principle of <HI>the exchange of the currency being at</HI> 20 <HI>for</HI> 1.</P>

<P>VIII. This &s;ame thing will &s;how <HI>to foreign powers our unbroken &s;trength, great re&s;ources, wi&s;dom of policy, and vi|gor in execution,</HI> give us <HI>great re&s;pectability</HI> in their eyes, and enable us to <HI>demand and expect any aids from them</HI> which
<PB N="126" REF="023972_0133_0FC2B645630D6768">
we may need; for the &s;tate of human nature is &s;uch, that tho&s;e can get <HI>lea&s;t help</HI> who <HI>need it mo&s;t,</HI> and tho&s;e can pro|cure <HI>mo&s;t friends</HI> who need them <HI>lea&s;t;</HI> and the <HI>be&s;t way</HI> for a man or a nation to <HI>get a&s;&s;i&s;tance from his neighbours</HI> is to be <HI>able to do without it.</HI></P>
<P>On the whole, I do not &s;ee that any thing more is nece&s;|&s;ary, than wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e, deci&s;ive coun&s;els, put into action with &s;pirit and re&s;olution. We have enough to do with, if we had but &s;pirit and wi&s;dom to call it into u&s;e; and I think <HI>this &s;pirit</HI> is much more wanting in our <HI>rulers</HI> than in the <HI>people.</HI> In old times of di&s;tre&s;s among <HI>the I&s;raelites,</HI> it was a &s;ign of ap|proaching deliverance when the <HI>Spirit of the Lord came on their great men, i. e.</HI> in the <HI>Hebrew</HI> dialect, <HI>a great &s;pirit, great courage,</HI> and <HI>re&s;olution,</HI> adequate to the work; as the <HI>trees of the Lord</HI> mean <HI>great trees;</HI> the <HI>&s;ons of God</HI> were their <HI>great men,</HI> and <HI>thunder</HI> is called the <HI>voice</HI> of the Lord, be|cau&s;e it is <HI>greate&s;t of voices</HI> in the natural world. The <HI>Ro|mans,</HI> without in&s;piration, &s;omehow catched the &s;ame idea. <HI>Audentes fortuna juvat.</HI> They e&s;teemed <HI>Fortune</HI> a divinity, ready <HI>to help tho&s;e</HI> who had &s;pirit and courage <HI>to help them|&s;elves.</HI> Little is to be expected from <HI>languid coun&s;els, half a&s;&s;ured re&s;olutions, plans</HI> that want <HI>extent adequate to their purpo&s;e,</HI> and <HI>vigor</HI> of execution equal to their <HI>extent.</HI> If I could &s;ee a little more of that <HI>Spirit of the Lord</HI> which ani|mated the brave old worthies, I &s;hould &s;oon expect to &s;ee the <HI>&s;word of the Lord</HI> follow, and our <HI>troubles</HI> and <HI>troublers</HI> all melting away before us.</P>
<P>But before I quit this &s;ubject, I beg leave to add one thought more, which appears to me of the mo&s;t capital importance, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>that no plan of taxation,</HI> or any thing el&s;e, can be of <HI>any good effect,</HI> if there is not <HI>&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">me method adopted</HI> to bring all the States into <HI>an union and punctuality of execu|tion.</HI> The lea&s;t company of men, who have a common con|cern, if it is but in a &s;hip or piece of banked meadow, find it ab&s;olutely and e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to have &s;ome way <HI>to compel their partners</HI> into a punctual <HI>di&s;charge of their quotas.</HI> The very exi&s;tence of our union requires this. If one State <HI>hangs back,</HI> another <HI>will,</HI> and the be&s;t concerted <HI>plan</HI> po&s;&s;ible may be rendered ineffectual by <HI>delays and defects</HI> in the execution.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="023972_0134_0FC2B64713BF0DC0">
It is e&s;&s;ential to the very being of any independent com|munity, that it has in it <HI>all the powers</HI> nece&s;&s;ary to its <HI>own pre&s;ervation.</HI> The&s;e powers doubtle&s;s <HI>exi&s;t</HI> in the Thirteen States, <HI>as perfectly</HI> as in any other community in the world.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">[Fir&s;t publi&s;hed in Philadelphia, Dec. 13, 1780.]</HEAD>
<P>THE Tender-Act of <HI>November</HI> 29, 1780, is publi&s;h|ed by order of the A&s;&s;embly of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> for public con&s;ideration, and therefore the duty and re&s;pect due to the A&s;&s;embly and the Public obliges every one to con&s;ider it, and offer &s;uch remarks on it as de&s;erve public notice. In compliance with this duty, I have con&s;idered the &s;aid act, and the following Strictures appear to me of importance &s;ufficient to engage the public attention.</P>
<P>The <HI>nature of a Tender-Act</HI> is no more or le&s;s than <HI>e&s;ta|bli&s;hing by law the &s;tandard value of money,</HI> and has the &s;ame u&s;e with re&s;pect to the <HI>currency,</HI> that the legal &s;tand|ard <HI>pound, bu&s;hel, yard, or gallon</HI> has to <HI>tho&s;e goods,</HI> the quantities of which are u&s;ually a&s;certained by tho&s;e weights and mea&s;ures; therefore to call any thing a <HI>pound or &s;hilling,</HI> which <HI>really is not &s;o,</HI> and <HI>make it a legal &s;tandard,</HI> is an <HI>error</HI> of the &s;ame nature as <HI>dimini&s;hing</HI> the <HI>&s;tandard bu&s;hel, yard, gallon,</HI> &amp;c. or making a law that a <HI>foot</HI> &s;hall be the <HI>legal yard,</HI> an <HI>ounce</HI> the <HI>legal pound, a peck</HI> the <HI>legal bu&s;hel,</HI>
<PB N="129" REF="023972_0136_0FC2B65748A29A10">
or a <HI>quart</HI> the <HI>legal gallon,</HI> and compelling every body to receive all <HI>goods due to them</HI> by &s;uch deficient mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>Further, to make any thing the <HI>legal &s;tandard</HI> of any of the&s;e, which is not of <HI>fixed</HI> but <HI>variable nature,</HI> is an error of the &s;ame kind and mi&s;chief as the other; <HI>e. g.</HI> to make a <HI>turnip</HI> the &s;tandard pound weight, which may dry up in the cour&s;e of a year to a <HI>pith</HI> of not more than <HI>two or three ounces,</HI> or to make a <HI>flannel &s;tring</HI> the &s;tandard <HI>yard,</HI> which will &s;hrink in u&s;ing to half its length. The ab&s;urdity of this is too glaring to need any thing further &s;aid on it.</P>
<P>But to come to the matter now in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t ob&s;ervation which occurs to me is, that the bills, which are made a tender, contain a <HI>public promi&s;e of money to be paid in &s;ix years.</HI> On which I beg leave to remark,
<PB N="130" REF="023972_0137_0FC2B6717B138CE8">
that the be&s;t and mo&s;t indubitable &s;ecurity of money to be paid in <HI>&s;ix years,</HI> or any <HI>future time,</HI> is not &s;o good or va|luable as ready ca&s;h. The truth of this propo&s;ition is &s;o evident and obvious to every body, that it cannot need proof.</P>
<P>Therefore the law, which obliges a man to accept the&s;e bills in&s;tead of ready ca&s;h, obliges him to receive a <HI>le&s;s</HI> valu|able thing in full payment of a <HI>more</HI> valuable one, and in|jures him to amount of the difference; and is &s;o far a direct violation of the <HI>laws of commutative ju&s;tice&mdash;laws</HI> grounded in the nature of <HI>human rights,</HI> &s;upported by the mo&s;t nece&s;|&s;ary <HI>natural principles,</HI> and enjoined by the mo&s;t expre&s;s au|thority <HI>of God Almighty,</HI> and which it is not po&s;&s;ible that any legi&s;lature on earth &s;hould <HI>have right</HI> to infringe or abrogate.</P>
<P>Again, the &s;ecurity ari&s;ing from the public promi&s;e is not generally deemed <HI>certain.</HI> The public <HI>faith</HI> has been <HI>&s;o often violated,</HI> and the <HI>&s;ufferings</HI> of individuals thence ari&s;ing have been &s;o <HI>multiplied and exten&s;ive,</HI> that the gene|ral confidence of our people in that &s;ecurity is much <HI>le&s;&s;en|ed;</HI> and as a chance or <HI>uncertainty</HI> can never be &s;o valua|ble as a <HI>certainty,</HI> tho&s;e bills mu&s;t and will be con&s;idered as le&s;s valuable than they would be, was the &s;ecurity on which they depended, free of all doubt or uncertainty; and con&s;equently, the di&s;count of their value will always be e&s;timated by, and of cour&s;e be equal to, this difference. Therefore, the inju&s;tice of forcing them on the &s;ubject at <HI>full value</HI> of pre&s;ent ca&s;h, is greatly increa&s;ed.</P>
<P>The&s;e po&s;itions and rea&s;onings are grounded on &s;uch no|toriety of fact, that any explanation or proof is needle&s;s; and I hope an objection again&s;t a law, drawn from the mo&s;t manife&s;t and acknowledged inju&s;tice of its operation and effect, will not be deemed trivial, or be ea&s;ily &s;et a&s;ide or got over.</P>
<P>Naked facts are <HI>powerful</HI> things, and arguments &s;ome|times do be&s;t, and have the greate&s;t effect, when addre&s;&s;ed to the <HI>feelings</HI> of mankind; and that I may pre&s;s the matter as clo&s;e as I can, I beg leave to propo&s;e the following ca&s;e, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>
<P>Suppo&s;e a man of grave phiz and character &s;hould, <HI>in di&s;tre&s;s,</HI> apply to his neighbour for the loan of 1000
<PB N="131" REF="023972_0138_0FC2B673460ECBE8">
<HI>&s;ilver</HI> dollars, with &s;olemn promi&s;e on his <HI>honor</HI> and <HI>truth</HI> to repay them in a month, and in the mean time the ten|der-act under con&s;ideration &s;hould pa&s;s into a law, and the borrower, at the month's end, &s;hould tender 1000 of the <HI>new</HI> paper dollars in payment.</P>
<P>I beg leave here to propo&s;e to every <HI>Member</HI> of the A&s;|&s;embly who voted for that law, and to every <HI>other</HI> man, who is a <HI>member of this State,</HI> what their &s;entiments of that acti|on would be, and in what light they would view the <HI>borrow|er,</HI> who tendered the <HI>paper</HI> dollars <HI>(i. e.</HI> 2/<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the debt) in payment of the &s;ilver ones he had received; <HI>i. e.</HI> would they con&s;ider him as an <HI>upright, hone&s;t man,</HI> or a <HI>&s;hamele&s;s ra&s;cal?</HI></P>
<P>In whichever of the two characters they may choo&s;e to con&s;ider &s;uch a man, it may be proper to note, that the <HI>act</HI> in que&s;tion, if pa&s;&s;ed into a law, would <HI>protect</HI> him, and not only &s;o, but would &s;ubject the lender to the <HI>lo&s;s</HI> of the <HI>whole money</HI> if he refu&s;ed to receive it. This is a &s;omewhat delicate matter, which it is painful to dwell long upon. I will therefore clo&s;e what I have to &s;ay on it with a few very &s;erious remarks, the truth, ju&s;tice, and propriety of which I humbly &s;ubmit to the reader.</P>
<P N="1">1. The wor&s;t kind of evil, and that which corrupts and endangers any community mo&s;t, is that <HI>iniquity which is framed by a law;</HI> for this places the mi&s;chief in the very &s;pot, on the very &s;eat, to which every one ought to look and apply for a remedy.</P>
<P N="2">2. It cannot be con&s;i&s;tent with the honor, the policy, the intere&s;t, or character of an A&s;&s;embly of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> to make a law, which, by its natural operation, &s;hall afford <HI>protection</HI> to manife&s;t inju&s;tice, deliberate knavery, and known wrong.</P>
<P N="3">3. No cau&s;e or end can be &s;o good, <HI>i. e.</HI> &s;o <HI>heavenly</HI> in its origin, &s;o <HI>excellent</HI> in its nature, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o <HI>perfect</HI> in its princi|ples, and &s;o <HI>u&s;eful</HI> in its operation, as to require or ju&s;tify <HI>infernal means</HI> to promote it. By <HI>infernal means</HI> I mean &s;uch as are mo&s;t <HI>oppo&s;ed to Heaven and its laws;</HI> mo&s;t repug|nant to natural principles of <HI>equity,</HI> which are all derived from <HI>Heaven;</HI> and mo&s;t de&s;tructive of the <HI>rights</HI> of human nature, which are e&s;&s;ential to the happine&s;s of &s;ociety, the laws of
<PB N="132" REF="023972_0139_0FC2B674B1D147D8">
which are <HI>engraven by Heaven</HI> on the heart of every man; &s;ome wicked men have formerly &s;aid, "let us do <HI>evil,</HI> that <HI>good</HI> may come, who&s;e <HI>damnation</HI> is ju&s;t."</P>
<P>But perhaps this <HI>&s;ort</HI> of argument may not have all the effect I could wi&s;h on the mind of <HI>every</HI> reader. I there|fore proceed to another argument, which goes to the na|ture and principle of the act it&s;elf, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that the <HI>credit or value of money</HI> cannot, in the very nature of the thing, be &s;upplied, pre&s;erved, or re&s;tored by <HI>penal laws,</HI> or any <HI>coercive</HI> methods. The &s;ubject is <HI>incompatible to force,</HI> it is out of its reach, and never can be made &s;u&s;ceptible of it, or controllable by it. The thing which makes money an object of de&s;ire, which gives it &s;trength of motive on the hearts of all men, is the general <HI>confidence,</HI> the <HI>opinion</HI> which it gains, as a &s;overeign <HI>means</HI> of obtaining every thing needful. This confidence, this opinion, exi&s;ts in the mind only, and is not <HI>compellable</HI> or <HI>a&s;&s;ailable by force,</HI> but mu&s;t be grounded on that evidence and rea&s;on which the mind can &s;ee and believe; and is no more &s;ubject to the action of force, than any other pa&s;&s;ion, &s;entiment, or affection of the mind; any more than faith, love, or e&s;teem.</P>
<P>It is not more ab&s;urd to attempt to <HI>impel faith</HI> into the heart of an unbeliever by <HI>fire</HI> and <HI>faggot,</HI> or to <HI>whip</HI> love into your mi&s;tre&s;s with a <HI>cow&s;kin,</HI> than to force <HI>value</HI> or <HI>credit</HI> into your money by <HI>penal laws.</HI></P>
<P>You may, indeed, by force compel a man to deliver his goods for <HI>money</HI> which he does not <HI>e&s;teem,</HI> and the &s;ame force may compel him to deliver his goods without any <HI>money</HI> at all; but the credit or value of the money cannot be helped by all this, as appears by numberle&s;s examples. Plain facts are &s;tubborn and undeniable proofs of this. Indeed, this has been tried among our&s;elves in &s;uch extent of places and variety of &s;hapes, and in every in&s;tance been found ineffectual, that I am amazed to &s;ee any attempt to revive it, under any devi&s;able form what&s;oever. Number|le&s;s are the in&s;tances of flagrant oppre&s;&s;ion and wrong, and even ruin, which have been the &s;ad effects of the&s;e dread|ful experiments, with infinite detriment to the community
<PB N="133" REF="023972_0140_0FC2B6762BD32D60">
in general, without effecting in any one in&s;tance the <HI>ends intended.</HI> The facts on which this argument depends, are fre&s;h in every one's memory.</P>
<P>I could wi&s;h, for the honor of my country, to draw a veil over what is pa&s;t, and that wi&s;dom might be derived from pa&s;t errors, &s;ufficient to induce every one to avoid them in future. In fine, from the contemplation of the nature of the thing, and of the facts and experiments which have been made in every variety of mode, and &s;up|ported by every degree of power and exertion, it appears as plain and undeniable as intuitive proof, that the credit or value of money is not in its nature controllable by force, and therefore, any attempt to reach it in that way, mu&s;t end in di&s;appointment, and the greater the efforts, and the higher the authority which may be exerted in that way, the greater mu&s;t be the chagrin, &s;hame, and mortification, when the ba&s;ele&s;s fabric &s;hall vani&s;h into &s;moke.</P>
<P>The only po&s;&s;ible method then of giving value or credit to money is, to give it &s;uch qualities, and clothe it with &s;uch circum&s;tances, as &s;hall make it a &s;ure means of pro|curing every needful thing; for money that will not an|&s;wer all things, is defective, and has not in it the full na|ture and qualities of money. In this way only it will grow fa&s;t enough into e&s;teem, and become a &s;ufficient object of de&s;ire, to an&s;wer every end and u&s;e of money. There|fore, when the que&s;tion is propo&s;ed, how &s;hall we give credit or value to our money? the an&s;wer, the only true an&s;wer, is, bring it into demand, make it nece&s;&s;ary to eve|ry one, make it a high means of happine&s;s, and a &s;ure re|medy of mi&s;ery. To attempt this in any other way is to go out of nature, and of cour&s;e into difficulty, only to ob|tain &s;hameful di&s;appointment in the end.</P>
<P>There is nothing better than to take things in their natu|ral way. A <HI>great and difficult work</HI> may be accompli&s;hed by ea&s;y diligence, if a good method and a wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e choice of means are adopted; but a <HI>&s;mall work</HI> may be made difficult, very &s;oon, if taken at the wrong end, and pur&s;ued by un|natural means. There is a <HI>right</HI> and a <HI>wrong method</HI> of doing every thing. You may lead with a <HI>thread</HI> what you
<PB N="134" REF="023972_0141_0FC2B677B4CD9400">
cannot drive with <HI>whips</HI> and <HI>&s;corpions.</HI> The <HI>Britons</HI> have found this to their co&s;t, in the unnatural means they have pur&s;ued to pre&s;erve and recover their dominions in <HI>Ameri|ca.</HI> I wi&s;h we might be made wi&s;e by their errors.
<Q><HI>Felix quem faciunt aliena pericula cautum.</HI></Q></P>
<P>I would be willing to learn wi&s;dom from <HI>Great Britain. Fas e&s;t ab ho&s;te doceri.</HI> Amid&s;t all their madne&s;s, and in all their di&s;tre&s;&s;es for money, they never once thought of mak|ing their bank or exchequer bills a tender, or &s;upporting their currency by penal laws. But the&s;e con&s;iderations may have little effect on <HI>&s;ome minds,</HI> who are not very de|licate in their choice of means, but &s;eem re&s;olved to carry their point, <HI>volente nolente Deo.</HI></P>
<P>I therefore ha&s;ten to another topic of argument, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> It appears to me the act is founded in mi&s;taken and very had policy, and by its natural operation mu&s;t produce many ef|fects extremely prejudicial to our great and mo&s;t important intere&s;ts.</P>
<P N="1">1. It &s;eems plain to me, that the act has a fatal tenden|cy to de&s;troy the great motives of <HI>indu&s;try,</HI> and to di&s;heart|en and di&s;courage men of every profe&s;&s;ion and occupation from pur&s;uing their bu&s;ine&s;s <HI>on any large &s;cale</HI> or to any <HI>great effect,</HI> and therefore will prevent the production of tho&s;e &s;upplies derived from hu&s;bandry and manufactures, which are e&s;&s;ential to our &s;afety, &s;upport and comfort. Few men will be&s;tow their labor, attention, and good money, with zeal, to procure goods and commodities for &s;ale, which they know they mu&s;t &s;ell for money which they e&s;teem bad, or at be&s;t doubtful. This propo&s;ition is &s;o obvious and natural, that it &s;trikes the mind with conviction at fir&s;t &s;ight with|out proof, and is &s;o amply confirmed by our pa&s;t experi|ence, that it can admit no doubt as to its truth or con&s;equence.</P>
<P>The extent and dreadful effects of this are <HI>unavoidable and immen&s;e.</HI> If the indu&s;try of the farmer and trade&s;man is di&s;couraged, and they cea&s;e to lay them&s;elves out for large crops and fabrics, the con&s;equence mu&s;t be an uni|ver&s;al
<PB N="135" REF="023972_0142_0FC2B6896F5CD120">
diminution and &s;carcity of the produce of the coun|try and mo&s;t important articles of living, as well as com|merce. The general indu&s;try of the country is of &s;uch va&s;t importance, is an object of &s;uch magnitude, that to check it, is to bring on ruin, poverty, famine, and di&s;tre&s;s, with idlene&s;s, vice, corruption of morals, and every &s;pecies of evil; but enumeration or enlargement is unnece&s;&s;ary here.</P>
<P>As money is the &s;inews of every bu&s;ine&s;s, the introduc|ing a doubtful medium, and forcing it into currency by pe|nal laws, mu&s;t weaken and le&s;&s;en every branch of bu&s;ine&s;s, in proportion to the diminution of inducement found in the money.</P>
<P N="2">2. The &s;ame thing will <HI>render the procurement of &s;upplies for the army difficult,</HI> if not utterly <HI>impracticable.</HI> Mo&s;t men will hold back their goods from the market, rather than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ell them for money of a doubtful credit; and there will be no po&s;&s;ible way of collecting them, but to &s;end a <HI>&s;uperior force</HI> into the country, and there take them by <HI>violence</HI> from the owner, which will occa&s;ion &s;uch an expen&s;e as will <HI>double the co&s;t</HI> of the &s;upplies by the time they get to the army, be &s;ubject to a thou&s;and <HI>frauds,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. This is the mo&s;t obvious and ntural operation of the act, if we con&s;ider its own nature only, and is confirmed by &s;uch am|ple experience, recent in the memory of every man, that it can leave no doubt but all this train of michiefs mu&s;t follow the act from its fir&s;t operation.</P>
<P N="3">3. I apprehend the act will, by its natural operation, tend to <HI>corrupt the morality of the people, &s;ap</HI> the &s;upport, if not the very foundation, of our <HI>independence,</HI> le&s;&s;en the re&s;pect due to our <HI>Legi&s;lature,</HI> and de&s;troy that <HI>reverence for our laws,</HI> which is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to their proper operation, and the peace and protection of &s;ociety. Many people will be &s;o terrified with the apprehen&s;ion of &s;eeing their real &s;ub&s;tance, the fruit of their labor and anxious attention, converted into a bundle of paper bills of uncer|tain value, that, to avoid this evil, they will have &s;trong inducements to rack their invention for all devi&s;able ways and methods of avoiding it; and this will give ri&s;e to &s;uch
<PB N="136" REF="023972_0143_0FC2B68A896C6E08">
numberle&s;s <HI>frauds, ambiguities, lies, quibbles,</HI> and <HI>&s;hams,</HI> as will introduce the habit and give a kind of facility to the practice of &s;uch guile and feats of art, as will endanger the <HI>uprightne&s;s, plain hone&s;ty,</HI> and <HI>noble &s;incerity,</HI> which ever <HI>mark</HI> the character of a happy and virtuous people.</P>
<P>Many, who wi&s;h well to our independence, and have many nece&s;&s;aries for our army which they would wi&s;h to &s;upply, will be yet held back from offering their goods, from the &s;ole con&s;ideration of the doubtful value of the bills in which tho&s;e &s;upplies mu&s;t be paid for; and in&s;tan|ces of this &s;ort I conceive will be &s;o numerous, as greatly to affect the &s;upplies of our army, and of cour&s;e the &s;up|port of our independence. The injuries and &s;ufferings of people, who are compelled to take &s;aid bills in &s;atisfaction of contracts for real money, will induce them in their rage to u&s;e the legi&s;lature, who formed the act, with great li|berty, and perhaps gro&s;s di&s;re&s;pect; whil&s;t the habit of re|proaching the legi&s;lature, and eluding the injurious act, will become general, and pave the way to an habitual and univer&s;al abhorrence of our legi&s;lature and contempt of our laws, with a kind of facility and artful dexterity in eluding the force of the whole code.</P>
<P>I freely &s;ubmit it to my reader, if the&s;e con&s;equences are at all unnatural or ill-drawn, if the &s;urmi&s;es are at all groundle&s;s, or the painting a white too &s;trong. No art of government is more nece&s;&s;ary, than that of keeping up the dignity and re&s;pectability of the legi&s;latures, and all courts and officers of government, and exciting and pre&s;erving in the hearts of the people a high reverence for the laws; and any thing which endangers the&s;e great &s;upports of the &s;tate ought to be avoided as a deadly evil.</P>
<P N="4">4. The act, I apprehend, will give a bad appearance to our <HI>credit, honor,</HI> and <HI>re&s;pectability,</HI> in the eyes of our neigh|bours on this continent, and the nations of <HI>Europe,</HI> and other more di&s;tant parts of the world. For when they come to be informed that our <HI>own people mu&s;t be compelled,</HI> by the lo&s;s of half their e&s;tates and impri&s;onment of their per&s;ons, <HI>to tru&s;t the public faith,</HI> they will at once conclude there mu&s;t be &s;ome great danger, &s;ome &s;hocking mi&s;chief

<P>It cannot be fairly objected to the&s;e Strictures, that they &s;uppo&s;e the bills funded by this act are of le&s;s value than hard money. The act it&s;elf implies this.

Be&s;ides, the fact &s;tands in &s;uch glaring light in the eyes of all men, that it is mere trifling to di&s;pute it.</P>
<P>I dare think that there is not a man to be found, either in the A&s;&s;embly or out of it, that would e&s;teem him&s;elf &s;o rich and &s;afe in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of 1000 of the&s;e dol|lars, as of 1000 <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> ones; and the mo&s;t effectu|al way to impre&s;s a &s;en&s;e of the deficiency of the act on the minds of all men, and even di&s;cover the idea which the A&s;&s;embly them&s;elves have of it, is to enforce it by penal|ties of extreme &s;everity; for were there no deficiency in the act, it could not po&s;&s;ibly require &s;uch penalties to give it all nece&s;&s;ary effect, nor is it &s;uppo&s;able that the A&s;&s;embly would add the &s;anction of horrid penalties to any of their acts, unle&s;s they thought there was need of them.</P>
<P>The enormity of the penalty de&s;erves remark. The pe|nalty for <HI>refu&s;ing</HI> a dollar of the&s;e bills is greater than for <HI>&s;tealing ten times the &s;um.</HI></P>

Further, the act alters, and of cour&s;e de&s;troys, the na|ture and value of public and private contracts, and of con&s;equence &s;trikes at the root of all public and private credit.

<HEAD>AN ESSAY OR Humble Attempt to examine and &s;tate the TRUE INTEREST Of PENNSYLVANIA with Re&s;pect to the Paper Currency.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">[Fir&s;t publi&s;hed in Philadelphia, Dec. 13, 1780.]</HEAD>
<P>I PROPOSE, fir&s;t, &s;ome remarks on the <HI>&s;ubject of paper money,</HI> and, &s;econdly, &s;ome particular con&s;idera|tion of the <HI>Acts of our A&s;&s;embly for i&s;&s;uing the new Conti|nental bills,</HI> with &s;ome rea&s;ons why I think the true intere&s;t of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> requires that <HI>tho&s;e acts &s;hould be repealed,</HI> and the i&s;&s;uing of tho&s;e bills &s;hould be &s;topped or &s;u&s;pended for the pre&s;ent, and I hope to do this without offence; for the great intere&s;ts of a State, in which 400,000 <HI>citizens</HI> are concerned, cannot be too well under&s;tood, nor the utility of its laws be too carefully examined, or the errors of them be di&s;covered and amended too &s;oon.</P>
<P><HI>Two things are e&s;&s;ential nece&s;&s;ary to give paper bills a cre|dit and currency equal to hard money.</HI> 1. <HI>Such certainty of</HI> HONEST <HI>and</HI> PUNCTUAL REDEMPTION, as &s;hall fully &s;atisfy the mind of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. 2. <HI>That the</HI> CREDIT <HI>and</HI> DEMAND <HI>for &s;aid bills &s;hould be &s;o con&s;tantly kept up, from the time of their</HI> EMISSION <HI>to that of their</HI> REDEMP|TION, <HI>that the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or may be able, at any time, to pa&s;s them at hard money value.</HI> The fir&s;t of the&s;e is provided for by
<PB N="140" REF="023972_0147_0FC2B6B7A17BD6A0">
the A&s;&s;embly, if their act &s;hall produce the <HI>certainty</HI> of re|demption required, which I am not here to di&s;pute: but the &s;econd is equally nece&s;&s;ary; for &s;hould the bills pa&s;s from their emi&s;&s;ion to their redemption, or any part of that intermediate time, at a depreciated value, &s;ay 2, 3, or 4 for 1, tho' they &s;hould be redeemed at full value at the <HI>expiration</HI> of their currency in the mo&s;t punctual manner, yet the <HI>mi&s;chiefs</HI> they would occa&s;ion <HI>in the mean time</HI> would be infinite.</P>
<P>One of which would be, that the depreciation it|&s;elf would render the final redemption of the bills at full value both unju&s;t and pernicious, as well as very hard and oppre&s;&s;ive to the body of the people; for, in this ca&s;e, the people mu&s;t be taxed, &s;ay <HI>two, three,</HI> or <HI>four times</HI> the value or current exchange of the bills; not to the <HI>public benefit,</HI> but &s;olely to increa&s;e the wealth of tho&s;e <HI>rich peo|ple,</HI> who will hoard up the bills, and have them in po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion at the time of their redemption. From which it ap|pears (and indeed I think it may be demon&s;trated from the plaine&s;t principles) <HI>that public bills ought always to be redeem|ed at that value or current exchange, at which they u&s;ually pa&s;s at the time of redemption, let their nominal value be what|ever it may.</HI> Indeed, the infinite and ruinous mi&s;chiefs of a fluctuating currency are &s;o generally felt and well under|&s;tood, that I conceive there is no need of proof, that it is equally nece&s;&s;ary to keep the value or exchange of bills &s;ta|ble and unvarying thro' the <HI>whole time of their currency,</HI> as to provide &s;ure funds for their <HI>final redemption,</HI> and that the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> of the&s;e does not depend &s;olely on the <HI>la&s;t.</HI> The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> of the&s;e depends on opinion, per&s;ua&s;ion, and general prac|tice; the <HI>la&s;t</HI> on the ability and integrity of the redeemer.</P>
<P>If you offer a bill to a &s;tranger, he never thinks of a&s;k|ing when, by whom, or how certainly that bill is to be re|deemed, but his only que&s;tion is, whether he can <HI>pa&s;s it again?</HI> Not one in a thou&s;and who takes a public bill, takes it with a de&s;ign to lay it up five or &s;ix years, tho' its redemption be ever &s;o &s;ure at that time, but his object is immediate u&s;e, to &s;erve his pre&s;ent occa&s;ions by in&s;tantly pa&s;&s;ing it again, or at lea&s;t having it in his power to do

it whenever occa&s;ion may offer. I take it that the&s;e principles and rea&s;onings are perfectly plain and clear, and will afford, by the cleare&s;t inference, the following con&s;e|quence, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>That no public bills ought ever to be i&s;&s;ued, which have not the&s;e two great and e&s;&s;ential &s;upports,</HI> 1. a CERTAINTY <HI>of final redemption; and, 2. &s;uch general con|fidence and demand, as will in&s;ure their currency at full value without depreciation, during the whole time of their circula|tion.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed, it appears to me, that to i&s;&s;ue public bills with|out the&s;e &s;upports is the plaine&s;t folly, bordering on in&s;ani|ty, and mu&s;t be very <HI>criminal,</HI> when done in the face of clear evidence and conviction. It further appears to me, that the <HI>new Continental bills have not the&s;e &s;upports at pre|&s;ent, and therefore ought not to be i&s;&s;ued till the&s;e &s;upports can be obtained,</HI> and of con&s;equence, that the great intere&s;t of the State requires that the laws for i&s;&s;uing them &s;hould be re|pealed; or at lea&s;t that the i&s;&s;uing them &s;hould be &s;u&s;pend|ed till the&s;e &s;upports can be obtained; for which I offer the following rea&s;ons, which &s;eems to me to be of weight and force &s;ufficient to engage the mo&s;t &s;erious attention of the public.</P>
<P N="1">1. The quantity (<ABBR>viz.</ABBR> 10,000,000 of dollars) is at lea&s;t <HI>four times as much in value as all the old Continental bills,</HI> and therefore mu&s;t, from the nature of the thing, depreciate it, were its funds ever &s;o indubitable, and the public con|fidence in it ever &s;o great.&mdash;I conceive the pre&s;ent mean exchange of the Continental bills is about 100 for 1, at lea&s;t they cannot be &s;et at le&s;s than 80 for 1, on any &s;ure facts, which makes the whole quantity (<ABBR>viz.</ABBR> 200,000,000) worth 2,500,000 of hard dollars, which is but one fourth of 10,000,000;&mdash;and further, that increa&s;ing the quantity of money will <HI>(caeteris paribus)</HI> decrea&s;e its value. This will always be a natural truth, as long as the value of mo|ney is nothing but the proportion between the quantity of circulating money and the <HI>occa&s;ions</HI> of money (as I think I have demon&s;trated in my <HI>E&s;&s;ays</HI> on Free Trade and Fi|nance, and e&s;pecially in the <HI>Second E&s;&s;ay</HI>) and which now
<PB N="142" REF="023972_0149_0FC2B6BB0AF73C58">
is become &s;uch a received truth, that it cannot need further proof here.</P>
<P N="2">2. The &s;um of 10,000,000 of dollars, added to the other bills which will continue circulating, &s;uch as State money, and certificates of various kinds, &amp;c. <HI>is much more paper money than the Thirteen States ever did or can bear.</HI> The whole circulating ca&s;h of the Thirteen States, on the be&s;t calculation I have been able to make, never did exceed 12,000,000, I rather think it not more than 10,000,000 of hard dollars in value, and not more than half, or at mo&s;t three fifths, of the circulating ca&s;h in this State was paper in 1774; and I am convinced, by very good docu|ments, that that proportion was not exceeded in the other States, where paper money was circulated; and as mo&s;t of the trade and bu&s;ine&s;s that requires &s;tock or ca&s;h, is now in &s;tagnation, there cannot be occa&s;ion for &s;o much circu|lating ca&s;h as in 1774, when every bu&s;ine&s;s, trade, and oc|cupation was in full vigor.</P>
<P>Indeed, it is ea&s;y to make a pretty ju&s;t e&s;timate of the quantity of circulating paper which the country can now bear, from fact, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> from the value of the pre&s;ent circulat|ing paper, of which the Continental bills are much the greate&s;t part; by which it will appear, that the pre&s;ent circulating paper cannot exceed <HI>four</HI> millions of <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> dollars in value,&mdash;and that it is as much as the Thirteen States can bear, or rather more, is plain from this,&mdash;<ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that the paper of all &s;orts continues to depreciate. Now, in the&s;e circum&s;tances, to pour on 3 or 4 times as much new paper as we are found, by experiment, by plain fact, able to bear, is in my opinion a &s;ure way to depreciate it. I think it is not more certain, if you pour three or four buckets of water into one that is already full, that &s;ome of it mu&s;t run over; yea, I think that the whole quantity you pour in mu&s;t all run over.</P>
<P N="3">3. We have <HI>already too much money circulating among us,</HI> for it is certain that even hard money will not purcha&s;e more than two thirds as much labor, country produce, or other nece&s;&s;aries, which are not heightened in their price by the extraordinary expen&s;e of importation, as the &s;ame
<PB N="143" REF="023972_0150_0FC2B6BC86A74AF8">
would have purcha&s;ed in 1774. Hence it follows, that the quantity of money has increa&s;ed beyond the occa&s;ions of money in that proportion. This is rea&s;oning on &s;ure prin|ciples, which any body may di&s;prove that can; the price of market, rents, and even real e&s;tates, afford a mo&s;t plain and &s;triking proof of this; it is further to be noted here that the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> armies import much money, which they are daily &s;preading among us, and thereby ra|pidly increa&s;e our circulating ca&s;h. It follows then, that our be&s;t policy is to reduce the quantity of our circulating medium, e&s;pecially that dangerous part of it which con|&s;i&s;ts in paper, that we may avoid, as far as po&s;&s;ible, the further horrors and mi&s;chiefs of a depreciating currency, rather than to increa&s;e the evil by pouring in immen&s;e ad|ditions.</P>
<P N="4">4. The pre&s;ent Continental money <HI>pa&s;&s;es at its exchange</HI> thro' all the Thirteen States readily enough; any thing&punc; even hard money, may be purcha&s;ed with it; therefore it an&s;wers well the ends and u&s;es of a circulating medium. But the new bills, however well e&s;tabli&s;hed their funds may be, <HI>have not the confidence</HI> of the public in general, nor will they be readily <HI>received.</HI> They are a <HI>new thing,</HI> and their fate uncertain. This will naturally depreciate them in the fir&s;t beginning of their circulation, by which the whole <HI>commerce</HI> of the Thirteen States, as well as the <HI>pub|lic finance and expenditures,</HI> will receive the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential injury. Now <HI>to call in a currency that is well received, and which an&s;wers well the ends and u&s;es of a circulating medium, and i&s;&s;ue of it one of doubtful credit, which will pro|bably be received with diffidence, if not di&s;gu&s;t, appears to me the height of ab&s;urdity.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. The <HI>new bills,</HI> however funded, mu&s;t &s;tand on the <HI>&s;ame ba&s;is as the old,</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the PUBLIC FAITH, which however modified, is neither better nor wor&s;e in the one ca&s;e than the other, and therefore the new bills will de|pend on no better &s;upports than the old ones, and of con|&s;equence nothing can be gained by the exchange, the trou|ble, ri&s;k, and expen&s;e of which mu&s;t therefore be wholly lo&s;t.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="144" REF="023972_0151_0FC2B6BDF987B4F8">
6. If the old bills &s;hould depreciate, the public will <HI>gain</HI> the depreciation; but if the new bills &s;hould depre|ciate, the public mu&s;t <HI>lo&s;e</HI> the depreciation, or mu&s;t &s;uffer a &s;econd bankruptcy to avoid the lo&s;s.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>If the new bills &s;hould be emitted, they will not an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of a</HI> GENERAL CURRENCY, <HI>which is one prin|cipal end of their creation: but, like the State money, will be confined to the State that &s;igns them.</HI> For it is very certain, that one State will no &s;ooner take the new bills &s;igned by another State, than they will take any other bills &s;igned by the &s;ame State; for the Continental &s;ecurity, added to the new bills, is neither expre&s;&s;ed nor intended to mend the cre|dit or make good the <HI>deficiencies</HI> of any of the States, but &s;uch as are rendered <HI>incapable of</HI> payment by the <HI>power or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the enemy.</HI> The pre&s;ent Continental bills have a general currency, and therefore ought to be kept in circulation in preference to the new bills, if no other rea&s;on could be given for it.</P>
<P N="8">8. Mo&s;t of the other States who have emitted the new bills, have i&s;&s;ued them at 40 for 1, <HI>i. e.</HI> at about half their nominal value, and it is in my opinion pretty much in vain for us to attempt to give our bills a better exchange or va|lue than theirs have, in as much as their funds of redemp|tion and means of intermediate circulation are as good as ours; be&s;ides, to attempt this would be to introduce &s;uch a variety, &s;uch a jargon of exchanges, as would defeat every purpo&s;e of a general currency of tho&s;e bills.</P>
<P N="9">9. If the new bills &s;hould be i&s;&s;ued <HI>at half value,</HI> or &s;hould &s;peedily <HI>depreciate to 2 for</HI> 1 (and I think on every natural principle they mu&s;t depreciate to 3 or 4 for 1 by the time they are all out) I &s;ay, at 2 for 1 the States will not only&mdash;1. give 4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"><HI>&s;.</HI> for every 20<HI>&s;.</HI> which they i&s;&s;ue; and, 2. <HI>give 10 per cent. intere&s;t</HI> in hard money for it all; but, 3. when they have i&s;&s;ued it all, it will pay <HI>but half the expenditures of the year,</HI> if tho&s;e expenditures are 10,000,000 of hard dollars, as they are generally comput|ed; for it is plain that 10,000,000 <HI>at 2 for</HI> 1, will pay but 5,000,000 real money; and if the whole 10,000,000 &s;hould be called in by taxes within the year, yet at the end of the
<PB N="145" REF="023972_0152_0FC2B6D299427228">
year, the States would find them&s;elves in debt 5,000,000 of hard dollars, over the above the heavy balance now again&s;t them, and the annual increa&s;e of the public debt abroad.</P>
<P>But if (as will mo&s;t likely be the ca&s;e) mo&s;t of the new bills &s;hould be out&s;tanding at the end of the year, we mu&s;t add to the afore&s;aid 5,000,000 of hard dollars debt, the amount of all the out&s;tanding bills, with one year's hard money intere&s;t on them all&mdash;a va&s;t chaos this, equal to the dreary regions of ancient night! My reader may think my rea&s;oning is &s;anguine, and expre&s;&s;ion &s;trong, but both proceed from the real convictions of my own mind, from the force of truth.</P>
<P>If I have di&s;covered and de&s;cribed properly the&s;e opera|tions of the new bills on the Thirteen States, it follows that <HI>this State mu&s;t take its &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">re</HI> of <HI>the&s;e con&s;equences</HI> if they i&s;&s;ue <HI>their quot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> of them.</P>
<P>What I would humbly propo&s;e, in&s;tead of this mea&s;ure, is, <HI>to repeal the acts for i&s;&s;uing the new bills, or &s;u&s;pend their execution till we are in condition to give them a currency truly and really equal to hard money, and keep them &s;o&punc; and in the mean time to continue the circulation of the pre&s;ent Continental or State bills, or both, till we can get hard money enough for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> currency,</HI> or till time and wi&s;dom &s;hall di&s;cover &s;ome other re&s;ource, le&s;s fraught with di&s;honor, di&s;appointment, and ruin.</P>
<P>In fine, <HI>taxation equal to the public expenditures</HI> is, in my opinion, the only method in nature by which our <HI>defence</HI> can be continued, our <HI>independence</HI> be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;erved, a de&s;truc|tive <HI>increa&s;e of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> public debt</HI> be avoided, <HI>our currency</HI> (hard or paper) be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in a &s;tate of <HI>fixed value,</HI> the natural &s;prings of <HI>indu&s;try</HI> be given to every profe&s;&s;ion of men, our <HI>&s;upplies</HI> made plentiful, the public <HI>confidence</HI> be re&s;tored to the <HI>public coun&s;els,</HI> the <HI>morality</HI> of our people be revived, and the <HI>ble&s;&s;ings</HI> of heaven be &s;ecured to our&s;elves and our po&s;terity. All this, I conceive, is proved fully in my five E&s;&s;ays, e&s;pecially the Fifth, to which I refer every one who is not already weary of my thoughts, and would wi&s;h to be further acquainted with my &s;entiments on this &s;ub|ject.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="023972_0153_0FC2B6D490FA38D0">
Upon the whole matter, I conceive that <HI>union in coun&s;els, uniformity of method</HI> in our finances, and the benefits of a <HI>general currency,</HI> were the principal <HI>objects</HI> of the re&s;olution of Congre&s;s of the 18th of March, 1780 (tho' I confe&s;s I never could &s;ee the advantages of that re&s;olution.) I further conceive <HI>the&s;e objects are already lo&s;t;</HI> for the different ex|change at which the different States i&s;&s;ue and pa&s;s the bills, and the want of confidence of the States in each other (for one State will not take the bills of the other <HI>States,</HI> as we find by experiment) together with the deficient and dila|tory &s;upports given to tho&s;e re&s;olutions, I &s;ay, all the&s;e to|gether de&s;troy the intended union of coun&s;els and uniformi|ty of finances, and render a general currency of the bills impracticable.</P>
<P>Indeed, I ever con&s;idered the <HI>enormous quantity of bills propo&s;ed for emi&s;&s;ion in the &s;aid re&s;olution,</HI> to be a &s;eed of mi&s;chief, which would grow up with force in the cour&s;e of its operation, and defeat its effects; the ill con&s;equences of which could no otherwi&s;e be avoided, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n by the mo&s;t &s;trenuous and united efforts of the States in its &s;upport, and u&s;ing the greate&s;t prudence and caution as to the quan|tity i&s;&s;ued; all which I noticed with great freedom in my &s;trictures on &s;aid re&s;olution, in my <HI>Fifth E&s;&s;ay,</HI> publi&s;hed ten months ago. It now appears that the efforts of the States in &s;upport of &s;aid re&s;olution have been very dilato|ry, far from deci&s;ive, and widely differing in the manner of exertion; that the general confidence of the public in the &s;ucce&s;s of the bills is greatly &s;haken; and that the ge|neral currency of them is rendered impracticable, and not to be expected, and of cour&s;e that the g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> de&s;ign, and be|nefits of the mea&s;ure are already become de&s;perate.</P>
<P>I cannot &s;ee that it would be wi&s;e in our A&s;&s;embly fur|ther to pur&s;ue a <HI>&s;cheme, the principal objects of which are al|ready defeated,</HI> and which, of cour&s;e, has already <HI>lo&s;t its ca|pital u&s;es;</HI> e&s;pecially when there are &s;o many and important objections lying in the way of its operation: to &s;uppo&s;e that we can <HI>cut our way</HI> thro' all the&s;e difficulties, and force the bills into circulation by <HI>penal laws</HI> is an idea which I cannot think admi&s;&s;ible, for the rea&s;ons I alleged in my

<P>The people of the Thirteen States are almo&s;t in the &s;ame condition which they would have been in, if they <HI>had &s;old their principal produce to bankrupts</HI> or broken merchants, who could not pay them.

The&s;e are facts notorious to every body, and ari&s;e directly from this, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that there is not public money enough to pay the public creditors.</P>
<P>Whereas, if every man was called on for his &s;hare of the public debt, <HI>there would be money enough to pay every bo|dy,</HI> and all this dreadful deluge of calamity would be re|medied at once, and every individual would be a gainer by the tax he would pay, becau&s;e he lo&s;es more every year by the <HI>confu&s;ions</HI> and <HI>di&s;appointments</HI> ari&s;ing from <HI>this want</HI> of public monies, than his <HI>tax</HI> would amount to.

<P>It is further manife&s;t, that &s;uch an univer&s;al <HI>demand</HI> for money will give it <HI>value,</HI> will make it an object of univer|&s;al <HI>de&s;ire;</HI> this will give <HI>&s;pring</HI> to indu&s;try, <HI>motion</HI> to eve|ry method of obtaining money, and <HI>&s;ecurity</HI> to every man who has obtained it.

of <HI>Greece</HI> received the declaration of their liberties from the mouth of the <HI>Roman</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador.

<P>I think it impo&s;&s;ible that further arguments &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary to prove the expediency, yea, the &s;trong propri|ety, and urgent rea&s;on of di&s;mi&s;&s;ing at once all the&s;e mo&s;t unnatural and de&s;tructive mea&s;ures, the&s;e ab&s;urd <HI>&s;candals of human rea&s;on, and of</HI> American <HI>policy;</HI> that &s;o our minds may be open to impre&s;&s;ions from the true &s;tate of our ca&s;e; open to the real difficulties we are under, and to the proper mea|&s;ures which will, by their natural operation, afford us relief.

But the ab&s;urdity of our mea&s;ures is not all the objecti|on I have to them. They are <HI>inadequate</HI> to their own pur|po&s;es.

I think it would be far more <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>&s;atisfactory</HI> to our people, to make out <HI>e&s;timates and demands equal to our nece&s;&s;ities,</HI> which will give this &s;trong inducement to the efforts of each individual, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that it will be adequate to the purpo&s;e; that the <HI>means, however difficult, will be &s;ufficient to produce the great ends de&s;igned.</HI> When the great demand is made known, the fir&s;t que&s;tion will be, <HI>Is this enough? Will this be &s;ufficient to the purpo&s;e?</HI> An a&s;&s;ured, affirmative an&s;wer will in&s;pire great courage and effort, when the object is the <HI>great wi&s;h,</HI> the <HI>pa&s;&s;ionate de&s;ire</HI> of almo&s;t every individual, as is mo&s;t manife&s;tly the ca&s;e with our people. It is a fal&s;e delicacy, a &s;hameful timidity, a dangerous injury to a nation, to keep them ignorant of their <HI>true circum&s;tances and real dan|ger, and not give them an opportunity to put the means of their &s;afety in practice.</HI></P>
<P>I am clearly of opinion, that &s;carce a man of any weight could be found in the Thirteen States, who would not rea|dily and with joy pay a much larger &s;um than his tax would amount to, if he had rea&s;onable hope that the <HI>di|&s;tre&s;&s;es, oppre&s;&s;ions,</HI> and <HI>dangers</HI> of the country could be thereby removed, a <HI>free cour&s;e of ju&s;tice</HI> be re&s;tored, every man's <HI>per&s;on</HI> and <HI>property</HI> be <HI>protected,</HI> and the <HI>natural in|ducements of indu&s;try</HI> be favored and encouraged, and our <HI>in&s;ulting enemies be effectually oppo&s;ed.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>yearly incomes of the country</HI> are much more than &s;uf|ficient to do all this, if properly called into u&s;e. We have two armies in the country to feed, and the produce of the country is amply &s;ufficient for both. The &s;upplies of the <HI>one</HI> we are paid for, it is only <HI>the other</HI> which mu&s;t be &s;up|ported from our own re&s;ources; and after &s;upplying both

armies (if our hu&s;bandry and trade could be &s;uffered to take their natural cour&s;e) we &s;hould have large produce to &s;pare for exportation.</P>
<P>In addition to all this, I am clearly of opinion that our re&s;ources are &s;o great, that with proper management (even tho' the war &s;hould continue &s;even years longer) <HI>the trea&s;ury of the Thirteen States might be filled with &s;ilver and gold coin, and be made a BANK as &s;afe and u&s;eful as that of</HI> Am&s;ter|dam <HI>or</HI> Venice; and all this within a very &s;hort time, as may be clearly demon&s;trated to any body who is acquainted with the nature and con&s;titution of this kind of &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch,</HI> as &s;oon as they found out the &s;ecret of in|&s;piring their people with the true &s;pirit of indu&s;try and en|terpri&s;e, &s;oon recovered their national credit, and grew amazingly rich, long <HI>before their wars with</HI> Spain <HI>cea&s;ed.</HI> We have va&s;tly greater means in our power than they had, and want nothing but <HI>their wi&s;dom</HI> to improve them to as great advantage. I conceive it to be very certain and manife&s;t, that <HI>our national character, honor, and &s;afety are yet in our own power,</HI> and depend on nothing for their full and <HI>perfect e&s;tabli&s;hment,</HI> but our own <HI>wi&s;dom</HI> and <HI>effort,</HI> and the <HI>ble&s;&s;ing</HI> of Divine Providence.</P>
<P>I will conclude this E&s;&s;ay with one propo&s;ition, which, however much like a paradox it may appear at fir&s;t &s;ight, I think is very demon&s;trable, and I conceive will require little more than mere in&s;pection for a &s;hort time, to con|vince every man of di&s;cernment and &s;erious attention of its truth, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>it would be ea&s;ier and cheaper for every man of bu&s;ine&s;s, whether farmer, trade&s;man, or merchant, to pay his &s;hare of the whole annual expenditures of the public within the year, than not to pay it; i. e.</HI> he would live more <HI>ea&s;y</HI> thro' the year, and be <HI>richer</HI> at the end of it, by <HI>paying</HI> &s;uch tax, than by <HI>not paying</HI> it.

<P>It is further nece&s;&s;ary that this be done in &s;uch <HI>&s;ea&s;on,</HI> as to give &s;ufficient time for the deliberations of Congre&s;s, and carrying their re&s;olutions into effect, in the mo&s;t na|tural and ea&s;y way, that thereby the dangers, mi&s;chiefs,

<P>IV. <HI>To call on the &s;everal States for &s;uch quotas as may be a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by Congre&s;s,</HI> and to keep them advi&s;ed of every thing that the demands of Congre&s;s and the public exigencies may require of them, re&s;pecting the revenue.</P>
<P>V. <HI>To in&s;pect all the expenditures of the States,</HI> of every kind, to the end they may be made with the <HI>be&s;t economy,</HI> and to the <HI>utmo&s;t benefit</HI> of the public.</P>

<P>VII. <HI>To in&s;pect all debts due to and from the States, all bills of credit,</HI> and <HI>all treaties</HI> and <HI>contracts</HI> relating to the revenue or public monies, to the end there may be collec|tion and payment made, with that punctuality and deci|&s;ion nece&s;&s;ary to the <HI>&s;upport of the public faith,</HI> that &s;o the States may receive no detriment from any <HI>failure or delay</HI> in this delicate and important particular.</P>
<P>VIII. <HI>To keep an account of the whole revenue,</HI> and all its parts, and of the <HI>whole expenditures,</HI> and all their parts, in &s;o clear and dige&s;ted a manner, as to be able, on rea&s;on|able notice, to report to Congre&s;s the &s;tate and amount of each, with the <HI>deficiency</HI> or <HI>&s;urplu&s;age</HI> of the revenue for purpo&s;es of government.</P>

make him&s;elf &s;o acquainted with the &s;ame, as to be able to point out the <HI>be&s;t ways and means</HI> of increa&s;ing the reve|nue, for any purpo&s;es of public &s;afety and advantage, when Congre&s;s &s;hall require &s;uch &s;ervice from him.</P>
<P>X <HI>To make di&s;covery and report to Congre&s;s</HI> of any depart|ment of the expenditures, which are <HI>more expen&s;ive th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n nece&s;&s;ary,</HI> and of any that <HI>are &s;tarved</HI> thro' want of &s;uch &s;upplies and allowances as are nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>XI. To be in all things &s;ubject to the <HI>control of Congre&s;s,</HI> and to be <HI>accountable to them only.</HI></P>
<P>This view of the exten&s;ive duty of a Financier clearly di&s;covers the <HI>nature, importance, and u&s;es</HI> of his office. The great de&s;ign of it is, to range the &s;everal &s;ources of the public revenue in order, that the <HI>whole &s;y&s;tem</HI> of it may be <HI>clearly under&s;tood,</HI> that any <HI>part that is wanted</HI> may be at hand, that the whole may be <HI>rai&s;ed</HI> with the <HI>lea&s;t burden</HI> po&s;&s;ible to the people, and be made to go as <HI>far, and pro|duce as much benefit,</HI> as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The <HI>invention of ways and means</HI> of improving the reve|nue, or rai&s;ing public money, is not a more nece&s;&s;ary part of the bu&s;ine&s;s of finance, than <HI>economy and prudence in the expenditures.</HI> Perhaps the latter is the more important and difficult of the two. For I conceive there may be found <HI>ten men</HI> who know how to <HI>get money,</HI> to <HI>one</HI> who knows how to <HI>keep it,</HI> or <HI>pay it away with proper economy and prudence;</HI> and I apprehend that our pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and the exhau&s;ted &s;tate of our revenues, ari&s;e more from defects in the <HI>la&s;t</HI> of the&s;e, than the <HI>fir&s;t.</HI> The natural operation of this office di&s;covers the&s;e errors, and leads to a remedy. For,</P>
<P N="1">1. It is manife&s;t that the man, who&s;e duty it is to <HI>find all the money</HI> which is to pay every department, will be mo&s;t likely to &s;tudy and introduce <HI>economy</HI> in the expendi|tures, and to &s;py out and check any <HI>exce&s;&s;ive expen&s;e or wa&s;te.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. It is further very natural to &s;uppo&s;e, that when the Congre&s;s are informed with certainty of the <HI>extent of the revenue,</HI> they will calculate their <HI>expenditures within the limits of it;</HI> &s;o that this office becomes a re&s;traint even
<PB N="166" REF="023972_0173_0FC2B76ED5E11300">
on Congre&s;s it&s;elf, if we can &s;uppo&s;e them <HI>capable of any want of due con&s;ideration or prudence</HI> in this re&s;pect: And,</P>
<P N="3">3. Every officer of expenditure will find him&s;elf under <HI>&s;ome check</HI> al&s;o, when he reflects that he mu&s;t bear the <HI>pene|trating eye of the man</HI> who finds all the money which he <HI>&s;pends or pays out</HI> of his office. Further,</P>
<P>The <HI>powers, rights,</HI> and <HI>privileges</HI> of this great office are al&s;o obvious from the above &s;urvey of its nature and u&s;es.</P>
<P N="1">1. It appears that this office is of <HI>great extent and im|portance,</HI> and therefore ought to receive from every depart|ment of the States all &s;uch <HI>&s;uitable helps, countenance, and &s;upport,</HI> as are nece&s;&s;ary to procure and pre&s;erve its <HI>u&s;es, proper operation, authority, and dignity.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. That this officer ought to be <HI>kept con&s;tantly advi&s;ed by Congre&s;s, of all &s;uch re&s;olutions</HI> of that body as re&s;pect the public <HI>revenues and expenditures.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. That he &s;hould have right to <HI>demand all accounts,</HI> and <HI>in&s;pection of all books,</HI> which re&s;pect the public revenues and expenditures. And,</P>
<P N="4">4. That he &s;hould be ve&s;ted, by commi&s;&s;ion from Con|gre&s;s, with all <HI>the authority</HI> nece&s;&s;ary to the full and per|fect di&s;charge of all the duties of his office, and be indulg|ed with <HI>all the privileges</HI> nece&s;&s;ary to the <HI>&s;ucce&s;s, u&s;e, and dignity</HI> of it.</P>
<P>As this ground is all new and untrodden, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> dan|gerous to define <HI>too particularly</HI> the <HI>duties, right<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">,</HI> and <HI>privileges</HI> of this office. A little practice on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> and general principles on which it is founded will gradually open the particulars further nece&s;&s;ary, which may be ad|ded by future provi&s;ions, if &s;uch &s;hall be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound expedient.</P>
<P>As I am ignorant of the pre&s;ent arrangement of the re|venues and expenditures, I cannot tell how far any of the above particulars may fall within the departments already e&s;tabli&s;hed, and have here only to add, that as far as any of them are provided for, <HI>a return only</HI> will be nece&s;&s;ary from the &s;ubordinate officers, of &s;uch particulars as may be requi&s;ite to complete the accounts, and furni&s;h the ma|terials of this great office.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="023972_0174_0FC2B76FEA667630">
From which it appears, that this office does not inter|fere with any other offices of the revenue or expenditures; &s;uch as the office of <HI>Trea&s;urer or Trea&s;ury Board, Auditor of Accounts,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. This office <HI>begins</HI> where they <HI>end.</HI> This office takes the &s;tate and balance of the accounts of all the other officers, as they make up and fini&s;h them. This office arranges and brings them all into one view, and &s;tates in order every branch both of revenue and expendi|ture, from the aggregate of which the amount of the whole is made.</P>

<P>With the&s;e documents, a man endowed with the proper <HI>&s;kill,</HI> great <HI>comprehen&s;ion</HI> of mind, and natural <HI>aptitude</HI> to the &s;ubject, nece&s;&s;ary for this great work, will be able to &s;ee the <HI>exce&s;&s;es</HI> and <HI>deficiencies</HI> of each branch of revenue and expenditure, and to judge in what manner every error may be corrected and reformed; and what makes this re|formation ea&s;ier is, that the error may be &s;oon di&s;covered, and the particular branch or place in which it lies be point|ed out, and the natural and proper means of amendment put into direct and &s;peedy operation, which <HI>nips the evil in the bud,</HI> before it has <HI>time</HI> to grow into &s;uch <HI>fatal magnitude,</HI> as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> only to <HI>corrupt the department</HI> in which it lies, but al&s;o to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> into other contiguous departments, &s;o as to become <HI>ruinous</HI> in its continuance, and very <HI>difficult</HI> in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></P>

the wor&s;t way that perhaps ever was or could be thought of, is that which has been adopted for five years pa&s;t, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>paying the expenditures by the depreciation of the currency. This has done it indeed in &s;ome mea&s;ure, but with &s;uch an in|undation of calamities as are enough to draw tears.</HI></P>
<P>A <HI>good Financier</HI> is much the <HI>rare&s;t character</HI> to be found of any in the great departments of &s;tate. <HI>France</HI> has had but <HI>three</HI> in 400 years, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the <HI>Duke of Sully,</HI> under <HI>Hen|ry IV.

Eng|land</HI> has not had one &s;ince Queen <HI>Elizabeth's</HI> time: per|haps Lord <HI>North</HI> is equal to any that have gone before him, but his whole talents at finance are all exhau&s;ted in <HI>running his nation in debt,</HI> and contriving ways and means of paying the <HI>intere&s;t</HI> by the endle&s;s oppre&s;&s;ion of his people.</P>
<P>The great <HI>Po&s;tlethwait</HI> indeed, about thirty years ago, had the true genius of financiering, as appears by his va|rious treati&s;es on that &s;ubject; but the &s;tupid mini&s;try of his time had &s;o little conception of the matter, that they did <HI>not know a Financier when they &s;aw one,</HI> or, like the cock in the fable, did not know the <HI>value of the jewel</HI> which <HI>&s;hined</HI> in their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ight.</P>
<P>We rarely read in hi&s;tory of any wars, or other move|ments <HI>of expen&s;e,</HI> undertaken by any nation, but we find their <HI>finances &s;oon fail,</HI> and then the movements (be they ever &s;o important) mu&s;t be <HI>di&s;continued,</HI> or <HI>&s;tarved</HI> into ve|ry trivial effect.

This calamity does not always ari&s;e from the <HI>ex|pen&s;es</HI> being greater than the <HI>re&s;ources;</HI> it more commonly takes its origin from &s;ome or all of the following capital errors of finance:</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>In the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment and collection;</HI> as when the tax is not laid <HI>in &s;ea&s;on,</HI> or is &s;o laid that it does not operate by way of <HI>equali|ty</HI> on every part of the community; when the tax is con&s;um|ed <HI>in the collection of taxes;</HI> by an over number of officers or other needle&s;s expen&s;e; by the <HI>embezzlement</HI> of the officers; &amp;c. &amp;c. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">f this kind of error are, all free quarters of

<P N="2">2. By <HI>wa&s;te or want of economy in the expenditure;</HI> as where the money is paid for purpo&s;es <HI>diver&s;e</HI> from tho&s;e for which it was granted, and appropriated; when the pub|lic movements are &s;o ill contrived and managed, as to co&s;t <HI>more money</HI> than is nece&s;&s;ary; when <HI>u&s;ele&s;s projects</HI> are undertaken; when the public property is &s;uffered to <HI>wa&s;te, decay,</HI> or <HI>peri&s;h</HI> for want of <HI>due care</HI> and <HI>proper di&s;po&s;al</HI> of it; want of di&s;cernment and di&s;cretion to pay the <HI>mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing</HI> demands <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> and let tho&s;e debts lie unpaid, that can remain with the <HI>lea&s;t damage,</HI> whenever it &s;o happen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> that there is not money on hand enough to &s;atisfy <HI>all the demands.</HI> A great deal depends on this kind of di&s;cretion, when the demands may happen to <HI>exceed</HI> the &s;upplies, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>By &s;uffering the public credit to decay;</HI> this is an amaz|ing wa&s;te of the public wealth; for when a man's credit runs low, he mu&s;t be in difficulty to find people that will <HI>tru&s;t him at all,</HI> cannot expect a <HI>good choice,</HI> or to be well &s;erved, and after all, over and above the <HI>intere&s;t and other douceurs,</HI> he mu&s;t expect to pay heavily for the <HI>ri&s;k</HI> of tru&s;ting him.

<P>In all aggregate bodies, where <HI>many men</HI> make up a board, they can throw off the blame of any mi&s;manage|ment from <HI>one</HI> to <HI>another,</HI> &amp;c. which cannot be the ca&s;e when the tru&s;t is committed to a &s;ingle <HI>per&s;on.</HI> Be&s;ides, from the nature and duty, the de&s;ign and u&s;es of this office, it appears mo&s;t plain and evident, that <HI>it mu&s;t be the work of</HI> ONE MIND.</P>
<P>Its object is &s;o <HI>va&s;t and complex,</HI> and the action con&s;i&s;ts in <HI>comparing, fitting, and balancing</HI> &s;o many different things to and with each other, that it cannot be otherwi&s;e done than by the attention of a <HI>&s;ingle mind.</HI> In a &s;tate of qui|etude, when &s;mall expenditures are nece&s;&s;ary, little ex|perience, &s;kill, or economy may do; but when the expen|ditures grow va&s;t, and require a <HI>&s;trong draft</HI> on every re|&s;ource of the revenue, then <HI>&s;kill, attention, order, and method</HI> become e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary.

<P>I agree perfectly in his opinion, that it is not <HI>beneath the dignity</HI> of a government to explain any public mea&s;ures which may be mi&s;under&s;tood thro' <HI>ignorance;</HI> but &s;hould they be mi&s;under&s;tood any <HI>other way,</HI> I do not pretend to &s;ay how far the dignity of government might &s;uffer by an explanation.</P>

<P>A great number of mo&s;t re&s;pectable citizens, who were in the hou&s;e, re|turned the fire on the mob, and in fine, a number of lives were lo&s;t.</P>

<PB N="173" REF="023972_0180_0FC2B799EA1A32C0">
and I could have wi&s;hed that inquiries and pro&s;ecutions might have gone on, till the <HI>true, guilty authors</HI> could have been di&s;covered, held up to public view, and puni&s;hed; but government has found this inconvenient, &s;o I have no more to &s;ay about it.</P>
<P>I will only ob&s;erve, that I do not think the character of our citizens is that of unea&s;ine&s;s, tumult, and faction: I rather think they have exhibited an example of great meek|ne&s;s, of tame patience, almo&s;t bordering on &s;tupidity. Nor am I at all convinced, that the objections that have been made to the above&s;aid re&s;olution of Council, ari&s;e at all from <HI>faction,</HI> or any di&s;po&s;ition to impo&s;e on the unwary.

<P>I proceed, with all re&s;pect due to the honorable Council, to make &s;ome remarks on their defence. I have no plea|&s;ure in cavilling at the mea&s;ures of government, but only wi&s;h to ca&s;t light on a &s;ubject, in which our <HI>whole State is intere&s;ted.</HI> And, as I have never been concerned in fac|tions, ferments, tumults, or riots, but ever have been a peaceable citizen, and hearty well-wi&s;her to the true inter|e&s;ts of our State, I expect a candid attention of my fellow-citizens to the arguments I offer.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The facts referred to in the&s;e E&s;&s;ays were, at the time of their publi|cation, fre&s;h in every one's memory, and matters of general notoriety; but that is not the ca&s;e with &s;trangers, or even our own people, at this di&s;tance of time; therefore a &s;tatement of the&s;e facts may be nece&s;&s;ary to enable the reader to under&s;tand the&s;e remarks, and the rea&s;onings on them.</P>
<P>The A&s;&s;embly of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> 25th of <HI>March,</HI> 1780, i&s;&s;ued 100,000<HI>l.</HI> paper bills, funded on the <HI>faith</HI> of the State, &s;ome <HI>city lots,</HI> and the <HI>Pro|vince I&s;land,</HI> which at that time belonged to the State (hence this emi&s;&s;ion was called I&s;land money:) they al&s;o i&s;&s;ued the bills on intere&s;t at 5 <HI>per cent. per annum.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e bills, thus propped up, were u&s;hered into the world with great confidence of the A&s;&s;embly. They, however, pa&s;&s;ed in a depreciated &s;tate, much below their nominal value: to remedy which, a &s;ub&s;equent act was pa&s;&s;ed, <HI>Dec.</HI> 23, 1780, by which the&s;e bills were made "a legal tender; with penalties for <HI>refu&s;ing</HI> to take them for goods, &amp;c. <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>forfeiture</HI> of <HI>double</HI> the value offered; and for the &s;econd offence, of <HI>half</HI> the offender's lands, goods, and chattels, and <HI>impri&s;onment of his per&s;on</HI> during the war."</P>
<P>This act had &s;everal uncommon clau&s;es in&s;erted in it, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>
<P N="1">1. That agents for the public, collectors of taxes, &amp;c. &s;hould account to the trea&s;ury for &s;uch of the&s;e bills as they had received, at the price or rate at which they received them, <HI>i. e.</HI> at their depreciated value.</P>
<P N="2">2. That the exchange, till <HI>Feb.</HI> 1, then next, between Continental cur|rency and the&s;e bills, &s;hould be 75 for 1; but the real exchange of Conti|nental to hard money was 100 for 1, at that time.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Executive Council were empowered and required to publi&s;h the rate of exchange between &s;pecie and Continental money, in the fir&s;t week of every month after &s;aid <HI>Feb.</HI> 1: and</P>
<P N="4">4. That exchange, &s;o publi&s;hed, &s;hould be the exchange between <HI>Conti|nental money and the&s;e bills.</HI> On <HI>May</HI> 2, 1781, the current exchange of the&s;e bills to hard money was 3 for 1, and to Continental, was 75 for 1; but the exchange of hard money for Continental was about 220 or 225 for 1; and the practice was, to multiply the exchange of the State bills reduced to Continental, by their exchange with hard money, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> 3; which gave 225 Continental for the value of one hard dollar.</P>
<P>At this time, the Council declared the rate of exchange of hard money for the month of <HI>May,</HI> to be 175 for 1, which was the &s;ame thing (ac|cording to the operation of the &s;aid act of the 23d of <HI>Dec.</HI> 1780) as de|claring the exchange of the State bills to Continental to be 175 for 1; and the practice &s;till continued of multiplying the State money reduced to Con|tinental, which was now become 175 for 1, by its hard money exchange, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> 3; which made the exchange of Continental money three times 175, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> 525 for 1 of hard; a va&s;t and &s;udden leap indeed, and which became the <HI>current exchange</HI> in <HI>le&s;s than a week</HI> from the declaration of the exchange by the Council.</P>
<P>So that every per&s;on who had one week before given a hard dollar for 225 Continental ones, found that he had lo&s;t <HI>above half the value of his mo|ney,</HI> as it would, at the end of the week, purcha&s;e but 3-7ths of a hard dollar.</P>
<P>This made a mighty noi&s;e, and deeply affected every body; as Conti|tinental money was then <HI>the general currency,</HI> and <HI>all prices in market were &s;et or e&s;timated in it,</HI> as much as they were in <HI>old Tenor</HI> at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> at the clo&s;e of the <HI>la&s;t French war</HI> in 1763.</P>
<P>This rou&s;ed the feelings of mr. <HI>Reed,</HI> who was Pre&s;ident of the State at that time, and was &s;uppo&s;ed to be the <HI>prime mover,</HI> not only of the &s;aid <HI>declaration of Council,</HI> but of the <HI>act</HI> on which it was grounded, and induc|ed him to publi&s;h his defence of &s;aid declaration, on which the&s;e remarks were made.</P>
<P>The error really lay in the <HI>ab&s;urdity of the law it&s;elf,</HI> which limited the State money to a certain exchange of Continental (<ABBR>viz.</ABBR> 75 to 1) with &s;uch variations of exchange of hard money, as &s;hould be publi&s;hed by Council the <HI>fir&s;t week in every month;</HI> which exchange of <HI>hard money, by the operation of the act,</HI> became the legal exchange of the <HI>State bills,</HI> and of cour&s;e rai&s;ed their exchange 4-7ths higher than the <HI>real, true exchange</HI> of them was at that time, and made them bring indeed more than double the continental money which they would have purcha&s;ed before, but did not enable the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> to buy any more hard money than before.</P>
<P>Had the Council <HI>pur&s;ued the act,</HI> they might have <HI>been excu&s;ed;</HI> but their <HI>error</HI> lay in declaring <HI>a fal&s;e exchange</HI> of hard money, <HI>much below</HI> the true one, with de&s;ign, by way <HI>of trimming and bending facts,</HI> to reduce a <HI>little</HI> the ab&s;urd effects of the act it&s;elf. The true exchange of Continental for hard money, the fir&s;t week in <HI>Feb.</HI> 1781, was about 100 for 1, where it had &s;tood &s;everal months; in <HI>March</HI> it was about 115 to 1, and in the be|ginning of <HI>April,</HI> 130; but ro&s;e fa&s;t thro' the month, and got up to 220, the fir&s;t week in <HI>May.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e exchanges and the intere&s;ting effects of every variation of them, will appear to a &s;tranger as <HI>intricate and hard to under&s;tand</HI> as the <HI>price of &s;tocks</HI> in <HI>Change-alley;</HI> but they were perfectly under&s;tood by people of all ranks at that time, in as much as every variation of the exchange altered the value of all their ca&s;h on hand.</P>
<P>One thing makes the&s;e manoeuvres very important, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> they not only <HI>rai&s;ed the exchange</HI> of Continental money up to 500 or 600 to 1, but in a few days <HI>&s;topped the currency of the Continental bills intirely,</HI> after which they never pa&s;&s;ed at all <HI>as money;</HI> or any otherwi&s;e than as an article of &s;pecu|lation, at mo&s;t de&s;ultory and capricious exchanges from 400 to 1000 for 1.</P>
<P>The &s;ame cau&s;e &s;o di&s;gu&s;ted the minds of all men with paper bills of all &s;orts, that our State money (tho' undoubtedly well funded) depreciated in le&s;s than a month to 6 and 7 to 1: the final redemption of which, by a <HI>future appreciation,</HI> co&s;t this State above 120,000<HI>l.</HI> tho' we never received more than 20, or at mo&s;t, 30,000<HI>l. real value</HI> for it.</P>
<P>Perhaps this whole tran&s;action affords the mo&s;t &s;triking proof conceiva|ble, of the ab&s;urdity of all attempts to <HI>fix the value of money by a law,</HI> or any other methods of <HI>compul&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>In this in&s;tance we &s;ee the Continental money <HI>mortally wounded,</HI> an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> our State money <HI>debilitated and depreciated</HI> down to a <HI>&s;eventh</HI> part of its nominal value, by the <HI>very ill-fated means</HI> which were de&s;igned to <HI>&s;upport both of them.</HI></P>
<P>Thus <HI>fell, ended, and died,</HI> the Continental currency, aged 6 <HI>years;</HI> the mo&s;t <HI>powerful &s;tate engine,</HI> and the greate&s;t <HI>prodigy of revenue,</HI> and of the mo&s;t <HI>my&s;terious, uncontrollable,</HI> and almo&s;t <HI>magical operation,</HI> ever known or heard of in the <HI>political</HI> or <HI>commercial</HI> world; bubbles of a like <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ort which have happened in other countries, &s;uch as the <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi &s;cheme in France,</HI> the <HI>South-Sea in England,</HI> &amp;c. la&s;ted but a few months, and then <HI>bur&s;t</HI> into nothing; but this held out much longer, and &s;eemed to retain a <HI>vigorous con&s;titution</HI> to its la&s;t, for its circulation was never more bri&s;k and quick than when its exchange was 500 to 1; yet it <HI>expired without one groan or &s;truggle:</HI> and I believe, of all things which ever &s;uffered di&s;&s;olution &s;ince life was fir&s;t given to the creation, this <HI>mighty mon&s;ter died the lea&s;t lamented.</HI></P>
<P>Yet I hear that &s;ome folks are preparing to dig the &s;keleton of it out of the grave where it has quietly re&s;ted 9 <HI>years,</HI> that we may have the plea&s;ure of <HI>wa&s;ting a million or two</HI> upon its ob&s;equies.</P>
<P>If it <HI>&s;aved the State;</HI> it has al&s;o <HI>polluted</HI> the <HI>equity of our laws;</HI> turned them into <HI>engines of oppre&s;&s;ion and wrong;</HI> corrupted the <HI>ju&s;tice of our public admini&s;tra|tion;</HI> de&s;troyed the <HI>fortunes</HI> of thou&s;ands who had mo&s;t <HI>confidence in it;</HI> ener|vated the <HI>trade, hu&s;bandry, and manufactures</HI> of our country; and went far <HI>to de&s;troy the morality</HI> of our people; after all this, I wi&s;h it might be &s;uffered to lie where it is, in a &s;tate of quiet <HI>oblivion,</HI> yea, <HI>perfectly forgotten;</HI> for I think that every <HI>remembrance of it</HI> mu&s;t be mixed with <HI>bitterne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>I hope the reader will excu&s;e this &s;mall digre&s;&s;ion; for when I came to the <HI>&s;pot</HI> where the poor old CONTINENTAL died, I could not help &s;topping to mark <HI>the place</HI> with &s;ome little <HI>&s;ignal of notice.</HI></P></NOTE></P>

1. The fir&s;t fact alleged by the Council is, "<HI>that by the law</HI> of the State, and their <HI>own oaths,</HI> they are required to

publi&s;h the <HI>true</HI> exchange the fir&s;t week in every month&punc; but the whole city knows, that 175 for 1 was not the <HI>true exchange</HI> on the 2d in&s;tant; and the Council cannot be &s;up|po&s;ed to be <HI>ignorant</HI> of what is known to every other per&s;on in the city, and which the laws &s;uppo&s;e them to be acquainted with, or it would be ab&s;urd to lodge the power of judgment with them.</P>
<P>So that their <HI>variation from the true exchange</HI> cannot be excu&s;ed by any plea of <HI>ignorance.</HI> Therefore, when they &s;ay, "that they have not the &s;ame opportunity of <HI>knowing</HI> the current rate of exchange with accurate preci&s;ion," as the merchants have, I think it follows, that they ought to have inquired of the merchants, and gained the mo&s;t ac|curate information po&s;&s;ible, in a matter of that con&s;equence and delicacy, in which the <HI>laws</HI> of the State, their own <HI>oaths,</HI> and the <HI>intere&s;ts</HI> of the whole State, were concerned; but not that they &s;hould adopt the <HI>lowe&s;t</HI> known rate, at which they could di&s;cover that any commercial tran&s;actions had been adju&s;ted.</P>
<P>The <HI>lowe&s;t rate</HI> is never the <HI>current</HI> or <HI>true</HI> rate of ex|change, any more than the <HI>highe&s;t.</HI> It e&s;&s;entially and mo&s;t manife&s;tly differs from the <HI>true,</HI> as far as the <HI>extreme</HI> differs from the <HI>mean;</HI> a difference which the Council, on their own principles, had no right to make, as it did not, in my opinion, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">omport with, or &s;atisfy, either the <HI>words</HI> or <HI>meaning of the law,</HI> under which they acted. But while the obligations of the <HI>law,</HI> and their <HI>oaths,</HI> are urged, and the <HI>integrity</HI> and <HI>con&s;ciences</HI> of the Council are deeply affect|ed; would any one &s;uppo&s;e that the Council would publi&s;h what all the world knows to be <HI>fal&s;e,</HI> and that under the &s;anction of an <HI>oath?</HI> Could the Council, without violat|ing every principle of truth and veracity, declare the ex|change to be 175, when there was not one per&s;on in the city but mu&s;t know the contrary; Indeed I think it is bad
<PB N="177" REF="023972_0184_OFC2B7B1D0D1E498">
enough when a Council, by any &s;olemn act, violate their <HI>faith;</HI> but when they are hardy enough to violate their <HI>oath and "veracity"</HI> too, the matter mu&s;t look very &s;erious to all good men.</P>
<P>Further, while we are told &s;o much about <HI>laws</HI> of the State and <HI>oaths</HI> of office, I am led to inquire where the&s;e <HI>laws</HI> and <HI>oaths</HI> have been for &s;everal months pa&s;t, during which time the exchange was <HI>con&s;tantly and gradually ri&s;ing:</HI> and the Council, in the fir&s;t week in each month as con|&s;tantly declaring and publi&s;hing the exchange to be 75 for 1, for three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive months pa&s;t, when there was not a &s;ingle per&s;on in the city but mu&s;t have known the con|trary? <HI>Con&s;i&s;tency</HI> in the acts and declarations of public bodies, is of great u&s;e, and much to be de&s;ired; their <HI>dig|nity</HI> &s;tands mightily tarni&s;hed, and nigh unto ridicule with|out it.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another fact adduced by the Council, is, "that the rate of exchange has been, by common con&s;ent and u&s;age of trade, <HI>gradually ri&s;ing</HI> for &s;ome time pa&s;t; &s;o that no per&s;on, in his private dealing, pays or receives at the rate of 75 for 1;" and the whole city may add, <HI>neither was it on the 2d in&s;t.</HI> (the date of their re&s;olution) at 175 for 1; the current exchange was known to every one to be at lea&s;t 220 for 1, at that time.</P>
<P>The Council go on to argue, "that the people have rai&s;ed it (the exchange) by common con&s;ent, and Council have only followed them, by making a declaration of what <HI>they</HI> have done." If this allegation is <HI>true,</HI> it will ju&s;tify the Council's conclu&s;ion; but if it <HI>is not,</HI> it may be deem|ed a provoking, in&s;ulting attempt to impo&s;e a <HI>deception</HI> on <HI>"the unwary"</HI> public, and beneath the <HI>dignity</HI> of Council to adduce it. I will examine it with confidence, becau&s;e eve|ry merchant in the city knows whether it is true or not.</P>
<P>The re&s;olution of Council declares (if not expre&s;sly, at lea&s;t <HI>in effect,</HI> and all the effect that it could in rea&s;on be &s;uppo&s;ed to have) that the exchange of old Continental to State money is 175 for 1. Now the people, by com|mon con&s;ent and u&s;age of trade, have never done this; have not rai&s;ed that exchange to 175 for 1; it had never
<PB N="178" REF="023972_0185_OFC2B7B35BEB4EF0">
exceeded 75 at that time; therefore the re&s;olution annihi|lated the difference between 175 and 75, <HI>i. e.</HI> 4-7ths, <HI>i. e.</HI> &s;omewhat more than eleven &s;hillings in the pound, of all the Continental money, which every man was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of at that time. The truth of the&s;e facts and ob&s;ervations are obvious to every <HI>merchant,</HI> and indeed to every <HI>market-woman;</HI> and I leave them to &s;tand on their own ground, having no di&s;po&s;ition to indulge a vein of &s;arca&s;m or ridi|cule on this &s;erious &s;ubject.</P>
<P>I would only ob&s;erve, that this fatal re&s;olution has taken from thou&s;ands their <HI>daily bread,</HI> and ruined the fortunes of many who had capital &s;ums of that money on hand; that all the Continental money in the <HI>trea&s;ury</HI> of the State, or <HI>due</HI> in taxes, or any other way, is reduced more than half, to the great lo&s;s and embarra&s;&s;ment of the public; and eve|ry man who has <HI>not paid</HI> his taxes, may now pay them with <HI>le&s;s than</HI> half the real value which tho&s;e paid, who&s;e rates were collected one week before. "And is this rea&s;ona|ble? Is this ju&s;t?"</P>
<P>Further, the Council adduce this fact, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> "that the rate of exchange has been <HI>gradually ri&s;ing</HI> for &s;ome time pa&s;t:" and they might have added, that the people have been <HI>gradually conforming</HI> them&s;elves to that ri&s;e. But the ca&s;e is widely different, when they make &s;uch a &s;hocking <HI>&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">art at once,</HI> as from 75 to 175. A man may de&s;cend from the <HI>garret</HI> to the <HI>lower floor</HI> by a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">light of &s;tairs with|out any damage; but were he to de&s;cend at <HI>one leap,</HI> he would probably break his neck. The feelings of too ma|ny make any further explanation of this matter quite un|nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P N="3">3. But the third fact adduced by the Council, and which, I &s;uppo&s;e, is de&s;igned for a clincher, and which is to afford an argument of <HI>indi&s;pen&s;able nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> is this, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> "that the State of <HI>New-Jer&s;ey</HI> had, on the 27th ult. rai&s;ed their exchange to 150 for 1; and that the people of that State were pouring in their Continental money on us," &amp;c.</P>
<P>I cannot but &s;top here, to ob&s;erve how quick the old tone is changed. It has been a long time urged by people of great judgment, that the only natural and &s;ure way to
<PB N="179" REF="023972_0186_0FC2B7C7CE4B2A18">
prevent our being deluged by an inundation of Continental money, is, to keep the exchange of it &s;omewhat higher here, than it was in the neighbouring States. Yet tho&s;e very people who now, for this rea&s;on, force up the ex|change, have, for years pa&s;t, been in the bittere&s;t manner rai&s;ing an outcry again&s;t &s;uch as depreciated the cur|rency.</P>
<P>It is true, indeed, that the <HI>Jer&s;ey</HI> people could bring their Continental money over <HI>Delaware,</HI> and purcha&s;e State money at 75 for 1; and it is as true, that our people could carry the <HI>Jer&s;ey</HI> money over the <HI>Delaware,</HI> and &s;ell it at 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">0 for 1; and the advantage, on the whole, would be on our &s;ide; becau&s;e all the Continental money which was in the <HI>Jer&s;ies</HI> at the date of their re&s;olution, co&s;t their peo|ple 75 for 1, and they get no more for it here. Whereas our people, who carry their State money to them, pur|cha&s;ed it for 75, and got 150 for it.</P>
<P>But after all, it could be but the <HI>bubble of a day;</HI> it might furni&s;h employment for &s;tock-jobbers, &s;chemers, and idle people a &s;hort time, but could not continue long; it is not po&s;&s;ible that advantage could be taken long of different ex|changes on the two &s;ides of <HI>Delaware,</HI> whil&s;t the commu|nication is &s;o very great; and after all, the difference could be but trifling.</P>
<P>For neither the re&s;olution of the <HI>Jer&s;ies,</HI> nor of <HI>our State,</HI> can make the State money of either a whit more va|luable, <HI>i. e.</HI> make it purcha&s;e any more hard money or any other valuable goods, than before; but the <HI>violent &s;hock</HI> mu&s;t depreciate both, as we find by experience, which is the &s;ure&s;t evidence in matters of this nature.</P>
<P>But, <HI>&s;alus populi, &s;uprema lex.</HI> What is now to be done? Is it be&s;t to repeal the re&s;olution? I think not. The mi&s;|chief <HI>is done.</HI> A repeal will not <HI>remedy it.</HI> The <HI>Continental money has received its mortal wound.</HI> I do not think it ad|vi&s;able or po&s;&s;ible to <HI>heal</HI> it. The State money follows fa&s;t after it. The exchange for hard money on the 2d in&s;tant was 3 for 1; it is now &s;aid to be 4 for 1 at lea&s;t.</P>
<P>I think we have now no choice left, but to adopt my old doctrine, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> "To recur to our &s;olid &s;ub&s;tance, or real

<P>The pre&s;ent evil originates <HI>in the law,</HI> which the Coun|cil have undertaken to <HI>execute.</HI> If a law is &s;o <HI>ab&s;urdly</HI> made as to be <HI>incapable of execution,</HI> nothing but ab&s;urdity and perplexity can ari&s;e out of it. It will lie with the A&s;&s;em|bly in their approaching &s;e&s;&s;ion, to repeal the law or not.</P>
<P>On the whole, if the Council have not increa&s;ed the <HI>e&s;teem</HI> of the public by their re&s;olution, they are at lea&s;t en|titled to &s;ome <HI>compa&s;&s;ion.</HI> They have undertaken a <HI>ta&s;k that is impo&s;&s;ible;</HI> and I imagine their difficulties would puzzle much <HI>abler heads</HI> than theirs. If a legi&s;lature &s;hould make a law that a <HI>bar of iron</HI> &s;hould be cut a&s;under with an <HI>ax of wood,</HI> the officer entru&s;ted with the execution of it, might think it his duty to <HI>try;</HI> but he need not be &s;ur|pri&s;ed, after all his labor and chopping, to find the <HI>iron bar intire,</HI> and his <HI>ax &s;adly brui&s;ed.</HI></P>
<P>The exchange, or operation of money, is a very nice, touchy, delicate &s;ubject; and no man can, by right or pru|dence, intermeddle with it, who does not <HI>under&s;tand its na|ture and principles.</HI> No <HI>dignity</HI> of &s;tation, or <HI>reverence</HI> of character, can &s;ecure a man again&s;t <HI>ridicule</HI> and <HI>contempt,</HI> when he comes to be knocked about by the <HI>magical effects</HI> of that all-powerful &s;ubject, when put into operation un|der the direction of <HI>un&s;kilful hands.</HI></P>

<P>IT is of no con&s;equence to the public, whether TIMO|LEON or my&s;elf have the <HI>blacke&s;t heart,</HI> the <HI>foule&s;t mouth,</HI> or the <HI>mo&s;t &s;piteful pen.</HI> I yield to him the <HI>palm</HI> in every article of per&s;onal abu&s;e, &s;ly innuendo, or gro&s;s &s;can|dal; I mean to confine my&s;elf to &s;uch particulars as the public have an <HI>intere&s;t</HI> in.</P>
<P>In my Remarks on the Re&s;olution for rai&s;ing the Ex|change, I ob&s;erved that the Council, in their defence, had urged that both the <HI>laws of the State,</HI> and their <HI>oaths of of|fice,</HI> required what they had done.</P>
<P>I replied, that the exchange which they had publi&s;hed for &s;everal &s;ucce&s;&s;ive months, was not the <HI>true exchange;</HI> and therefore could not &s;atisfy either the <HI>law</HI> or their <HI>oaths</HI> of office. Mr. <HI>T.</HI> &s;eems to deny this, but &s;ays, the virtu|ous part of the community repre&s;ented the exchange as va|rious from 150 to 200 or 225. This I deny, and call on mr. <HI>T.</HI> to produce <HI>one virtuous per&s;on</HI> of the community, of
<PB N="182" REF="023972_0189_0FC2B7CD058905D0">
knowledge fit to be con&s;ulted, who ever <HI>told</HI> the Council the exchange on the date of their re&s;olution was 175; or one re&s;pectable merchant (as he goes on to a&s;&s;ert) who ever <HI>&s;aid</HI> or <HI>agreed</HI> that the exchange in <HI>March</HI> or <HI>April</HI> la&s;t, was 75 for 1. The <HI>contrary of both</HI> is well known to every body in this city. <HI>Plain fact</HI> is here notoriou&s;ly again&s;t mr. <HI>T.;</HI> for which I appeal to the <HI>whole city,</HI> who are the mo&s;t competent judges.</P>
<P>What mr. <HI>T.</HI> a&s;&s;erts, and I deny, is this, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that <HI>the exchange of hard money was here in</HI> February, March, <HI>and</HI> April <HI>la&s;t, at 75 for 1, and in</HI> May 2<HI>d, in&s;tant, at</HI> 175 <HI>for</HI> 1. I do not begrudge mr. <HI>T.</HI> the whole credit of his fetch, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> "that the act of A&s;&s;embly does not require the Coun|cil to publi&s;h the mo&s;t <HI>current rate,</HI> but &s;imply <HI>the rate of exchange;</HI>" but whatever credit this precious &s;ubtilty may give to his ingenuity, it can afford no help to his argu|ment; becau&s;e <HI>the exchange</HI> does mean the <HI>current</HI> or u&s;ual <HI>exchange,</HI> from the force of the particle <HI>the,</HI> for which I refer to the mo&s;t common <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Grammar of the &s;chools. The words are not <HI>an exchange,</HI> or <HI>any exchange,</HI> but <HI>the exchange,</HI> which cannot with any propriety mean any but that <HI>particular one</HI> which was mo&s;t <HI>current</HI> or u&s;ual at the time.</P>
<P>But mr. <HI>T.</HI> cannot po&s;&s;ibly under&s;tand this my&s;tery, how a <HI>buyer</HI> can be a <HI>lo&s;er</HI> by the Council's declaring the ex|change 175. I can ea&s;ily explain this matter of fact; be|fore the date of that declaration, with 220 dollars the buyer could purcha&s;e candles or fi&s;h to the value of one hard
<PB N="183" REF="023972_0190_0FC2B7E192A00D18">
dollar; but after that declaration, he mu&s;t pay 500 of the &s;ame dollars for the &s;ame goods; his lo&s;s therefore is the difference between 220 and 500, <HI>i. e.</HI> 280, or <HI>&s;omething more than eleven &s;hillings in the pound.</HI></P>
<P>This is a computation grown very familiar in the city; and I cannot but wonder it &s;hould remain &s;o long a my&s;te|ry to mr. <HI>T.;</HI> for this &s;ame rea&s;on, or to u&s;e the numeri|cal figures of the re&s;olution (to make the matter plainer to mr. <HI>T.</HI> who di&s;covers much my&s;tery, and &s;ome <HI>my&s;tery of my&s;teries</HI> in the matter) becau&s;e that 175 dollars bring no more after the re&s;olution, than 75 would bring before, eve|ry po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of Continental money, and of cour&s;e the pub|lic trea&s;ury, <HI>lo&s;es 4-7ths of all they have on hand,</HI> and all <HI>debts due and payable</HI> in that currency.</P>
<P>This he <HI>confidently a&s;&s;erts to be a fal&s;ehood.</HI> I think he might be a&s;hamed to deny a <HI>truth of public notoriety;</HI> but if he is really &s;o dull as not to be able to &s;ee this, it is manife&s;t the Council &s;ee it very plain, as is very evident by their attempt (tho' a vain one) to obviate the mi&s;chiefs of it, in the payment of <HI>taxes, fines,</HI> &amp;c.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By re&s;olve of Council, <HI>May</HI> 4, 178<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, collectors of taxes, fines, &amp;c. are directed to receive them in the following manner, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> when paid in old Continental money, they are to receive the &s;ame &s;um at which each per&s;on &s;tands charged in the duplicate (or tax-book;) but if paid in &s;pecie, or State money, or new Continental (<HI>i. e.</HI> 40 for 1 money) they &s;hould re|ceive it at the <HI>former exchange</HI> of 75 for 1, not according to the <HI>new rate</HI> of 175 for 1, publi&s;hed by Council, <HI>May</HI> 2d, <HI>i. e.</HI> two days before.</NOTE> and which, he &s;ays, is <HI>the real and true cau&s;e of much of the clamor</HI> again&s;t the Council's re&s;olution.</P>
<P>But in this he is very much mi&s;taken, becau&s;e the re|medy adopted by the Council is <HI>void of effect,</HI> as it does not reach or remedy the <HI>mi&s;chief;</HI> for tho' the tories and whigs too cannot pay their <HI>State money</HI> for taxes at more than 75, yet they can and daily do change their State money for <HI>Con|tinental,</HI> and pay their taxes with much le&s;s than <HI>half the real value</HI> which tho&s;e paid, who paid their taxes before the re|&s;olution was publi&s;hed, and this is publicly known to every body. Nor can I &s;ee any thing but per&s;onal hone&s;ty which prevents all our collectors from changing all the State money which they received before the re&s;olution, for old Conti|nental;
<PB N="184" REF="023972_0191_0FC2B7E2B5AC47B8">
and paying <HI>that</HI> into the trea&s;ury. This is the ble&s;&s;ed way in which (it is the peculiar felicity of mr. <HI>T.</HI> to di&s;cover) our trea&s;ury has been enriched &s;ince the re&s;o|lution.</P>
<P>If it &s;till does not appear to mr. <HI>T.</HI> that the old Conti|nental money, either in his own de&s;k or in the trea&s;ury, is reduced to le&s;s than <HI>half the value</HI> it had before the re|&s;olution, the be&s;t way I know of to &s;atisfy him&s;elf is, to take &s;ome of it to buy any nece&s;&s;aries, and he will, I doubt not, have a <HI>practical proof</HI> too &s;trong to admit a doubt; and if in this or any other way he &s;hould happen to be <HI>convinced,</HI> I &s;hall expect that he will <HI>publicly acknowledge it,</HI> for his own &s;ake.</P>
<P>But to follow mr. <HI>T.</HI> a little further. I have &s;aid in my Remarks, that "the re&s;olution of Council declares (if not expre&s;sly, at lea&s;t <HI>in effect,</HI> and all the effect that it could in rea&s;on be &s;uppo&s;ed to have) that the exchange of old Continental to State money, is 175 for 1." This mr. <HI>T.</HI> denies with great triumph. I mu&s;t beg the reader's atten|tion here a moment; the words of the law are, that the Council are required to publi&s;h "the then rate of exchange between &s;pecie and Continental money, which exchange, &s;o publi&s;hed, &s;hall be <HI>the exchange of the Continental money and the State money,"</HI> &amp;c. in which it is manife&s;t, that the mo&s;t expre&s;s de&s;ign of publi&s;hing the exchange of <HI>&s;pecie,</HI> was thereby to fix the exchange of the <HI>State money</HI> on a par with it; this was the effect which the legi&s;lature intended, and the very effect which the Council intended, as appears by their provi&s;ion <HI>again&s;t</HI> the effects of it, in the ca&s;e of taxes, fines, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Yet mr. <HI>T.</HI> with great a&s;&s;urance a&s;ks, "What has this to do with the Council's publication, which has not State money in contemplation?" His <HI>law logic</HI> helps him out but poorly here, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that the <HI>operation of the law</HI> on this publication, and not this <HI>publication</HI> it&s;elf, produced the ef|fect: he might as well deny that a <HI>miller</HI> grinds wheat, be|cau&s;e the <HI>mill&s;tones</HI> grind it; or that a <HI>man</HI> travels a journey on hor&s;eback, becau&s;e the <HI>hor&s;e</HI> only travels; for it is very plain, that the law, without this publication, would no

more have rai&s;ed the exchange of State money, than the mill would grind the wheat without the <HI>miller</HI> to &s;et it a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">going, or the hor&s;e perform the journey without the <HI>rider</HI> on his back. I therefore conclude, that every one will be convinced that my propo&s;ition is true; and if it is true, mr. <HI>T.</HI> acknowledges that <HI>"my ob&s;ervation will apply."</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>T.</HI> among other rea&s;ons why the Council did not rai&s;e the exchange la&s;t month, gives this one, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the <HI>&s;pe|culation</HI> at <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> and <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI> improved the <HI>credit</HI> of the old Continental money here, and therefore was not to be interrupted by any <HI>di&s;advantageous alteration</HI> of the exchange.</P>
<P>This &s;peculation was, to purcha&s;e Continental <HI>here</HI> at 220 for 1, and &s;ell it at <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> for 75; but in the very next paragraph, he reprobates the &s;ame kind of <HI>&s;peculation to the Jer&s;ies</HI> very &s;everely, I &s;uppo&s;e, becau&s;e it was not &s;o <HI>pro|fitable.</HI> "Is this," &s;ays he, "a traffic which public coun|&s;els are to promote and encourage?" I have no where &s;aid the&s;e &s;peculations were <HI>good,</HI> I mentioned them as <HI>bad</HI> things; and all I &s;aid, and all my argument required, was, that they were but <HI>bubbles of a day,</HI> &amp;c. and could not ju&s;|tify &s;o <HI>dangerous</HI> and <HI>ruinous</HI> a mea&s;ure, as rai&s;ing the ex|change to prevent their mi&s;chief, becau&s;e this would make the remedy wor&s;e than the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>

as he calls it, may have &s;ome palliation. But I can &s;ee no <HI>indecency</HI> in pointing out the evils or impracticabilities of a law, which the whole community mu&s;t &s;uffer; if this is done in &s;uch a way as tends to a remedy. <HI>The numberle&s;s in&s;tances of private di&s;tre&s;s,</HI> as well as the <HI>&s;tarving condition</HI> of all the public departments, and e&s;pecially the <HI>unprovided &s;tate of the army,</HI> were my great inducements to write my Remarks, and thereby expo&s;e the errors which at lea&s;t ag|gravated our calamities.

<P>My writings on <HI>finance</HI> are open to every body, and have met the approbation of many of the <HI>greate&s;t men</HI> in <HI>Ame|rica;</HI> and I believe mr. <HI>T.</HI> begins to feel the <HI>force</HI> of them: for I find he begins to '<HI>hope</HI> we &s;hall have <HI>&s;pirit</HI> enough to enforce a <HI>hard money tax,'</HI> which has long made <HI>a part</HI> of my &s;cheme of finance, and which mr. <HI>T.</HI> has con&s;tantly <HI>reprobated,</HI> till now.

<P>THESE authors, together with TIMOLEON, are the <HI>&s;ons of darkne&s;s.</HI> The printers are not at liberty to <HI>give up their names.</HI> I take PHOCION and TIMOLEON to be the &s;ame per&s;on. But as I &s;uppo&s;e they are a&s;hamed to be &s;een, I do not mean to di&s;oblige them by hauling them <HI>into light,</HI> but hope, whil&s;t it is impo&s;&s;ible for me to know who they are, it will be deemed very ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e any thing I write, de&s;igned for a <HI>per&s;onal application</HI> to ei|ther of them. PHOCION &s;ays, that "the CITIZEN has in&s;inuated that no merchant could <HI>have advi&s;ed the continu|ance</HI> of the exchange at 75 in <HI>April</HI> la&s;t." This is <HI>not true,</HI> PHOCION; you do <HI>depart from the fact;</HI> and you <HI>know you
<PB N="192" REF="023972_0199_0FC2AD9957B5BB90">
do.</HI> Had you kept to the fact, your &s;entence would have &s;tood thus, <ABBR>Viz.</ABBR> <HI>The CITIZEN denies that any re&s;pectable mer|chants ever informed the Council that the true or current ex|change of &s;pecie was</HI> 75 <HI>in</HI> April <HI>la&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>On this I have challenged TIMOLEON, and now chal|lenge PHOCION. It is mean for you, PHOCION, to &s;neak out from the point in que&s;tion, by &s;uch an artful but piti|ful eva&s;ion. A man of character would be a&s;hamed of it; but it is ea&s;ier to <HI>blu&s;h in the dark</HI> than before company.</P>
<P>You go on to mention mr. <HI>Robert Morris,</HI> as having given his opinion and advice to publi&s;h "the exchange in <HI>April</HI> at 75." I have rea&s;on to believe that this is <HI>not true;</HI> that mr. <HI>Robert Morris</HI> never was con&s;ulted in <HI>April</HI> la&s;t, nor did give any <HI>opinion</HI> or <HI>advice about publi&s;hing the ex|change</HI> &s;o late as <HI>April</HI> la&s;t; and that his opinion at that time was decidedly for publi&s;hing the exchange <HI>as high as the truth,</HI> if it was determined to publi&s;h it <HI>at all.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. PHOCION has called up mr. <HI>Morris'</HI>s name, which obliges me to do the &s;ame. Mr. <HI>Morris</HI> is ea&s;ily con&s;ulted, and will doubtle&s;s inform, if de&s;ired, what he did &s;ay on the &s;ubject to which I refer.</P>
<P>At an earlier period, &s;ay the beginning of <HI>February</HI> or <HI>March,</HI> when the exchange &s;tood with little variation, and the &s;ub&s;equent ri&s;e of it was not fore&s;een; when the effects of the tender law could not be known; many merchants, and mr. <HI>Morris</HI> among them, might think it dangerous to &s;hock the then &s;tate of our trade and currency by any un|natural and &s;udden &s;tart of the exchange, and might give it as their opinion and advice to publi&s;h it at 75. But if this is admitted ever &s;o true, it does not follow that any of them ever meant to intimate thereby, that the <HI>true exchange</HI>
<PB N="193" REF="023972_0200_0FC2ADBE4E677C18">
even in <HI>February</HI> or <HI>March,</HI> much le&s;s in <HI>April</HI> la&s;t; <HI>was</HI> 75.</P>
<P>Therefore, the whole matter does not contain any the lea&s;t contradiction to any thing which I have a&s;&s;erted, is therefore a manife&s;t departure from the fact in que&s;tion, and of cour&s;e is ju&s;t &s;o much foreign matter lugged in for the mere purpo&s;e of artful &s;huffle and deception.</P>
<P>Mr. PHOCION, you mu&s;t &s;tick better to the point; it is &s;hameful to &s;tart, &s;huffle, and evade the true matter which labours at bar; you mu&s;t keep to the fact; if you do not do this <HI>for your&s;elf,</HI> I will do it <HI>for you;</HI> for I can and will hold you <HI>&s;o clo&s;e,</HI> that it &s;hall not be in your power to <HI>&s;quirm out of the gra&s;p</HI> which pinches you. Farewell.</P>
<P>Now mr. IMPARTIAL calls for my attention a moment. It would be hard to take no notice of this man, who &s;eems to be boiling over with galli&s;h matter, and to have taken great pains to &s;crape together a con&s;iderable number of ve|ry hard, black words, &s;uitable to expre&s;s it. It is ea&s;y to &s;ee what &s;ort of a blowing genius this is, by only ca&s;ting an eye over his <HI>"crude revilements, villanies, hollow prin|ciples, pe&s;tilent &s;pirit, jaundiced eyes, feculencies of wealth, execrable characters, &s;tream of di&s;cord, Sodom, fal&s;e patriot,</HI> BECAUSE JEALOUS, <HI>&s;neer of the States, di&s;appointment and malice, which are</HI> IMMORTAL <HI>with the wicked</HI> AFTER THEIR DEATH," to which may be added his poor old hackneyed word, <HI>"junto,"</HI> which he has honored with large employment in this &s;ervice.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t beg to be excu&s;ed from following him thro' &s;uch a foul thicket of hard names, coar&s;e &s;currility, and low dirt. I can ea&s;ily believe he is not acquainted with Pre&s;ident <HI>Reed,</HI> tho' I cannot &s;o ea&s;ily admit that he is ac|quainted with <HI>his government,</HI> yet it is very clear he means to defend it; but as he &s;eems to be very &s;cant of matter, and barren of argument, it may be deemed a good-natured action to help him out a little. We generally judge of our governors as we do of our carpenters, <HI>by the goodne&s;s of their work when it is done.</HI></P>
<P>I will therefore attempt to lay down &s;ome general rules, marks, or &s;igns, by which a good or bad government may
<PB N="194" REF="023972_0201_0FC2ADC070262FE8">
be di&s;tingui&s;hed; by the help of which mr. IMPARTIAL may, if he plea&s;es, elucidate and embelli&s;h the government of his hero, and &s;upport it with <HI>&s;ome kind of argument,</HI> which will probably have more weight with the public, than any <HI>loud-&s;ounding, hollow</HI> encomiums whatever.</P>
<P N="1">1. When the <HI>laws protect</HI> the per&s;ons and property of the &s;ubject, the government is <HI>good:</HI> but it mu&s;t be <HI>weak</HI> or <HI>wicked,</HI> when the laws are &s;o framed, as in their operation to <HI>injure</HI> and <HI>oppre&s;s</HI> the &s;ubject in his per&s;on or e&s;tate.</P>
<P N="2">2. When the laws are held in general <HI>reverence</HI> by the people, the government is <HI>good:</HI> but it mu&s;t be bad, when the laws are generally con&s;idered as <HI>iniquitous,</HI> and <HI>execrated</HI> as &s;uch.</P>
<P N="3">3. When the laws <HI>re&s;train</HI> wicked men, and &s;upport, <HI>protect,</HI> and encourage hone&s;ty, upright dealings, and in|du&s;try, the government is <HI>good:</HI> but when the laws let all the <HI>rogues</HI> in the community <HI>loo&s;e on the hone&s;t</HI> and indu&s;tri|ous citizen, the government mu&s;t be very <HI>weak</HI> or <HI>wicked.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. When men of grave <HI>wi&s;dom,</HI> proper <HI>abilities,</HI> and known <HI>integrity,</HI> are put <HI>into office,</HI> the government is <HI>good:</HI> but when we &s;ee men of <HI>wild projection,</HI> doubtful <HI>morals,</HI> and inadequate <HI>abilities,</HI> crowding them&s;elves by addre&s;s and corruption into office, the <HI>confidence</HI> of the people in the government mu&s;t be <HI>lo&s;t,</HI> and the <HI>admini&s;tration</HI> it&s;elf mu&s;t be <HI>very weak.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. When the laws are made a <HI>rule of duty,</HI> and <HI>bul|wark of &s;afety</HI> and <HI>protection</HI> to the &s;ubject, the government is <HI>good:</HI> but when we &s;ee people impri&s;oned, per&s;ecuted, and ruined, <HI>without trial, conviction,</HI> or a <HI>day</HI> in <HI>court,</HI> the admini&s;tration will be deemed <HI>bad.</HI> The <HI>wor&s;t man</HI> that ever lived has a <HI>right to a day in court,</HI> to a cool hearing, and an opportunity <HI>to &s;ay,</HI> by him&s;elf or coun&s;el, all which he fairly can <HI>for him&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. When the laws are gravely admini&s;tered by the pro|per officers, the government is <HI>good:</HI> but when <HI>mobs, riots, and in&s;urrections</HI> infe&s;t the community, and di&s;turb the pub|lic peace; when the force of the community is put under any <HI>other direction</HI> than that of the <HI>law;</HI> the government becomes <HI>dangerous,</HI> and all &s;ecurity is lo&s;t.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="195" REF="023972_0202_0FC2ADC1F2AABFB8">
7. When the forces and re&s;ources of a State are &s;o mo|delled, put into order, and under &s;uch control, that both may be called into action and u&s;e, when, and to &s;uch de|gree as the public &s;afety requires, the government is <HI>good:</HI> but when the public debts are unliquidated or unpaid, the army ill-&s;upplied or ill-paid, the force of the State dwin|dling away, and the means of pre&s;ervation lo&s;t, the admi|ni&s;tration mu&s;t be amazingly <HI>bad,</HI> and the State in a condi|tion of mo&s;t alarming danger.</P>
<P N="8">8. When the trade, agriculture, and mechanic arts, tho&s;e great &s;ources of, not the wealth only, but even <HI>mo|rality,</HI> of a country, are properly encouraged, the govern|ment is <HI>good:</HI> but when we &s;ee our merchants drove, by the <HI>oppre&s;&s;ion</HI> of the <HI>laws,</HI> or <HI>ab&s;urdity of admini&s;tration,</HI> out of the State, and the farmers and trade&s;men following them with their produce and fabrics, the government mu&s;t be <HI>bad</HI> indeed.</P>
<P N="9">9. When the <HI>dignity</HI> of public boards, and the <HI>per&s;onal</HI> re&s;pectability of public men, are well kept up in the minds of the people, the government is <HI>good:</HI> but when the pub|lic <HI>boards</HI> are execrated as wanting common hone&s;ty or pru|dence, and public <HI>men</HI> cur&s;ed, hated, and de&s;pi&s;ed, as void of <HI>honor, truth, &s;kill,</HI> and <HI>uprightne&s;s,</HI> the government mu&s;t be <HI>bad.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. When we &s;ee the officers of government carefully attending to the forms, deci&s;ions, and &s;pirit of the laws, which &s;ecure the liberty of the &s;ubject, the government is <HI>good:</HI> but when we &s;ee officers in the great departments ea|gerly and impatiently gra&s;ping at <HI>enormous, dangerous,</HI> and <HI>arbitrary powers,</HI> attempting to deprive the &s;ubject of the <HI>rights of a jury,</HI> the <HI>habeas corpus,</HI> and other e&s;&s;ential legal forms of proce&s;s and trial, we have rea&s;on to apprehend the government is <HI>bad.</HI> The&s;e are the very <HI>tyrannies</HI> of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> court, and are ranked among the <HI>capital articles</HI> of complaint, on which we ground our <HI>war</HI> again&s;t them, and <HI>&s;eparation</HI> from them.</P>
<P N="11">11. A good government is willing to come to the <HI>light,</HI> and to <HI>explain</HI> the <HI>public movements</HI> to the under&s;tandings of the &s;ubject: <HI>bad governments</HI> are more impatient of <HI>exa|mination,</HI>
<PB N="196" REF="023972_0203_0FC2ADC364A1CEC0">
are apt to complain of the <HI>liberty of the pre&s;s,</HI> and when remarks are made on their mea&s;ures with ever &s;o much propriety, truth, and mode&s;ty, they rarely attend with candor, but endeavour to <HI>divert</HI> the attention of the public by <HI>artful eva&s;ions</HI> of the matter in que&s;tion, and in|&s;tead of an&s;wers, entertain their fellow-citizens either with ful&s;ome <HI>rapture</HI> of <HI>panegyric,</HI> or declamations of <HI>per&s;onal abu&s;e,</HI> or <HI>foul &s;currility,</HI> neither of which has the mo&s;t di&s;|tant relation to the grievances complained of, and which require their explanation.</P>
<P>It may be objected that the above rules, as far as they relate to the laws, will not apply, becau&s;e it <HI>luckily</HI> happens that our con&s;titution does not ve&s;t the Pre&s;ident with the power of legi&s;lation; it is equally true, that our con&s;titu|tion does not empower the Pre&s;ident to <HI>rai&s;e mobs,</HI> and <HI>ap|point committees,</HI> and therefore the objection may go to that part too. Upon this I have only to ob&s;erve, that the whole management of the public affairs, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to be under the great influence of any <HI>prime mover,</HI> is com|monly called the admini&s;tration or government of &s;uch a mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>But as I am not going to make u&s;e of any of the&s;e rules for my&s;elf, but wrote them &s;olely for the benefit of mr. IMPARTIAL, he or any body el&s;e that reads them, may <HI>leave out</HI> all which he thinks <HI>not for his purpo&s;e,</HI> and make u&s;e of, and apply, &s;uch of them only as he thinks <HI>apropos.</HI></P>
<P>On the whole I have to ob&s;erve to TIMOLEON, PHO|CION, IMPARTIAL, and every other writer, that if any of them are di&s;po&s;ed to object to the truth of any fact or principle which I have advanced or may advance, and will &s;tate their objections fairly and candidly, I &s;hall have plea|&s;ure in giving them all the information in my power; but if they are di&s;po&s;ed to <HI>run off in a tangent,</HI> thro' the end|le&s;s wilds of <HI>abu&s;e, per&s;onal reflection,</HI> and <HI>&s;currility,</HI> in which the public can have <HI>no concern,</HI> I mu&s;t beg leave to inform them once for all, that I think it incon&s;i&s;tent with the <HI>re&s;pect</HI> I owe the public, and the <HI>dignity of character</HI> I mean to a&s;&s;ume to my&s;elf, to follow them in &s;uch a <HI>dirty career.</HI> I have neither talents nor ta&s;te for that kind of writing.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="023972_0204_0FC2ADC4D3F7F810">
I mean to addre&s;s the under&s;tanding of my readers, not their pa&s;&s;ions, their bia&s;&s;es, much le&s;s their corrupt ta&s;te.

<P>III. A number of &s;overeign States uniting into one Com|monwealth, and appointing a &s;upreme power to manage the affairs of the union, <HI>do nece&s;&s;arily and unavoidably part with and transfer over to &s;uch &s;upreme power, &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of their own &s;overeignty, as is nece&s;&s;ary to render the ends of the union effectual,</HI> otherwi&s;e their confederation will be an union without bands of union, like a ca&s;k without hoops, that may and probably will fall to pieces, as &s;oon as it is put to any exerci&s;e which requires &s;trength.</P>
<P>In like manner, every member of civil &s;ociety parts with many of his natural rights, that he may enjoy the re&s;t in greater &s;ecurity under the protection of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>The UNION of the Thirteen States of <HI>America</HI> is of mighty con&s;equence to the <HI>&s;ecurity, &s;overeignty,</HI> and even <HI>liberty</HI> of each of them, and of all the individuals who compo&s;e them; <HI>united</HI> under a natural, well adju&s;ted, and effectual con&s;titution, they are a &s;trong, rich, growing power, with great re&s;ources and means of defence, which no foreign power will ea&s;ily attempt to invade or in&s;ult; they may ea&s;ily command re&s;pect.</P>
<P>As their exports are mo&s;tly either <HI>raw materials</HI> or <HI>pro|vi&s;ions,</HI> and their imports mo&s;tly <HI>fini&s;hed goods,</HI> their trade becomes a capital object with every manufacturing nation of <HI>Europe,</HI> and all the &s;outhern colonies of <HI>America;</HI> their friend&s;hip and trade will of cour&s;e be courted, and each power in amity with them will contribute to their &s;ecu|rity.</P>
<P>Their <HI>union</HI> is of great moment in another re&s;pect; they thereby form a <HI>&s;uperintending power among them&s;elves,</HI> that can moderate and terminate <HI>di&s;putes</HI> that may ari&s;e between <HI>different States,</HI> re&s;train inte&s;tine violence, and prevent any recour&s;e to the <HI>dreadful deci&s;ion</HI> of the &s;word.</P>
<P>I do not mean here to go into a detail of all the advan|tages of our union; they offer them&s;elves on every view,
<PB N="201" REF="023972_0208_0FC2ADE3ABE0DD48">
and are important enough to engage every hone&s;t, prudent mind, to &s;ecure and e&s;tabli&s;h that union by every po&s;&s;ible method, that we may enjoy the full benefit of it, and be rendered happy and &s;afe under the protection it affords.</P>
<P>This <HI>union,</HI> however important, cannot be &s;upported without a <HI>con&s;titution founded on principles of natural truth, fitne&s;s,</HI> and <HI>utility.</HI> If there is one article wrong in &s;uch con&s;titution, it will di&s;cover it&s;elf in practice, by its bale|ful operation, and de&s;troy or at lea&s;t injure the union.</P>
<P>Many nations have been ruined by the <HI>errors of their po|litical con&s;titutions.</HI> Such errors fir&s;t introduce wrongs and injuries, which &s;oon breed di&s;contents, which gradually work up into mortal hatred and re&s;entments; hence in|veterate parties are formed, which of cour&s;e make the whole community a hou&s;e divided again&s;t it&s;elf, which &s;oon falls either a prey to &s;ome enemies without, who watch to devour them, or el&s;e crumble into their original con&s;tituent parts, and lo&s;e all re&s;pectability, &s;trength, and &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>It is as phy&s;ically impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ecure to civil &s;ociety, good <HI>cement of union, duration, and &s;ecurity, without a con|&s;titution</HI> founded on principles of natural fitne&s;s and right, as to rai&s;e timbers into a &s;trong, compact building, which have not been framed upon true geometric principles; for if you cut one beam a <HI>foot too long or too &s;hort,</HI> not all the <HI>authority</HI> and all the <HI>force</HI> of all the carpenters can ever get it into its place, and make it fit with proper &s;ymmetry there.</P>
<P>As the fate then of all governments depends much on their political con&s;titutions, they become an object of mighty moment to the happine&s;s and well-being of &s;oci|ety; and as the framing of &s;uch a con&s;titution requires great knowledge of the rights of men and &s;ocieties, as well as of the intere&s;ts, circum&s;tances, and even prejudi|ces of the &s;everal parts of the community or common|wealth, for which it is intended; it becomes a very com|plex &s;ubject, and of cour&s;e requires great &s;teadine&s;s and comprehen&s;ion of thought, as well as great knowledge of men and things, to do it properly.

it with my be&s;t abilities, and hope from the candor of the public to e&s;cape cen&s;ure, if I cannot merit prai&s;e.</P>
<P>I BEGIN with my fir&s;t and great principle, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>That the con&s;titution mu&s;t ve&s;t powers in every department &s;ufficient to &s;ecure and make effectual the ends of it.</HI> The &s;upreme au|thority mu&s;t have the power of <HI>making war</HI> and <HI>peace</HI>&mdash;of <HI>appointing armies</HI> and <HI>navies</HI>&mdash;of appointing <HI>officers both civil</HI> and <HI>military</HI>&mdash;of making <HI>contracts</HI>&mdash;of <HI>emitting, coining,</HI> and <HI>borrowing money</HI>&mdash;of <HI>regulating trade</HI>&mdash;of making <HI>treaties with foreign powers</HI>&mdash;of e&s;tabli&s;hing <HI>po&s;t offices</HI>&mdash;and in &s;hort of doing <HI>every thing</HI> which the <HI>well-being</HI> of the Common|wealth may require, and which is <HI>not compatible</HI> to any particular State, all of which require money, and can|not po&s;&s;ibly be made effectual without it.</P>
<P><HI>They mu&s;t therefore of nece&s;&s;ity be ve&s;ted with a power of taxation.</HI> I know this is a mo&s;t important and weighty tru&s;t, a dreadful engine of oppre&s;&s;ion, tyranny, and injury, when ill u&s;ed; yet, from <HI>the nece&s;&s;ity of the ca&s;e,</HI> it mu&s;t be admitted.</P>
<P>For to give a &s;upreme authority a power of making <HI>con|tracts,</HI> without any power of <HI>payment</HI>&mdash;of appointing <HI>of|ficers</HI> civil and military, without money to <HI>pay</HI> them&mdash;a power to <HI>build &s;hips,</HI> without <HI>any money</HI> to do it with&mdash;a power of <HI>emitting money,</HI> without any power to <HI>redeem</HI> it&mdash;or of <HI>borrowing</HI> money, without any power to make <HI>payment,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. &s;uch &s;oleci&s;ms in government, are &s;o nugatory and ab&s;urd, that I really think to offer further arguments on the &s;ubject, would be to in&s;ult the under|&s;tanding of my readers.</P>
<P>To make all the&s;e payments dependent on the votes of <HI>thirteen popular a&s;&s;emblies,</HI> who will undertake to judge of the propriety of every contract and every occa&s;ion of mo|ney, and <HI>grant</HI> or <HI>withhold</HI> &s;upplies according to their opi|nion, whil&s;t at the &s;ame time, the operations of the whole may be &s;topped by the vote of a &s;ingle one of them, is ab|&s;urd; for this renders all <HI>&s;upplies</HI> &s;o <HI>precarious,</HI> and the <HI>pub|lic credit</HI> &s;o extremely <HI>uncertain,</HI> as mu&s;t in its nature ren|der all <HI>efforts in war,</HI> and all <HI>regular admini&s;tration in peace,</HI>
<PB N="203" REF="023972_0210_0FC2ADE6D81B72A0">
utterly impracticable, as well as mo&s;t pointedly ridiculous. Is there a man to be found, who would lend money, or render per&s;onal &s;ervices, or make contracts on &s;uch pre|carious &s;ecurity? of this we have a proof of fact, the &s;tronge&s;t of all proofs, a fatal experience, the &s;ure&s;t tho' &s;evere&s;t of all demon&s;trations, which renders all other proof or argument on this &s;ubject quite unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent <HI>broken &s;tate of our finances</HI>&mdash;public debts and bankruptcies&mdash;enormous and ridiculous depreciation of public &s;ecurities&mdash;with the total annihilation of our public credit&mdash;prove beyond all contradiction the vanity of all recour&s;e to the &s;everal A&s;&s;emblies of the States. The re|cent in&s;tance of the duty of 5 per cent. on imported goods, &s;truck dead, and the bankruptcies which en&s;ued on the &s;in|gle vote of <HI>Rhode-I&s;land,</HI> affords another proof, of what it is certain <HI>may be done again</HI> in like circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>I have another rea&s;on why <HI>a power of taxation or of rai&s;|ing money,</HI> ought to be ve&s;ted in the &s;upreme authority of our commonwealth, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the monies nece&s;&s;ary for the pub|lic ought to be rai&s;ed by a <HI>duty impo&s;ed on imported goods,</HI> not a bare 5 <HI>per cent.</HI> or <HI>any other per cent.</HI> on all imported goods indi&s;criminately, but a duty <HI>much heavier</HI> on all arti|cles of <HI>luxury or mere ornament,</HI> and which are con&s;umed principally by the <HI>rich</HI> or prodigal part of the community, &s;uch as <HI>&s;ilks</HI> of all &s;orts, <HI>mu&s;lins, cambricks, lawns, &s;uperfine cloths, &s;pirits, wines,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>Such an impo&s;t would ea&s;e the <HI>hu&s;bandman,</HI> the <HI>mechanic,</HI> and the <HI>poor;</HI> would have all the practical effects of a <HI>&s;ump|tuary law;</HI> would mend the economy, and increa&s;e the in|du&s;try, of the community; would be collected without the &s;hocking circum&s;tances of <HI>collectors and their warrants;</HI> and make the <HI>quantity of tax</HI> paid, always depend on the <HI>choice</HI> of the per&s;on who pays it.</P>
<P>This tax can be laid by the &s;upreme authority much more conveniently than by the particular A&s;&s;emblies, and would in no ca&s;e be &s;ubject to their <HI>repeals</HI> or <HI>modifications;</HI> and of cour&s;e the public credit would never be dependent on, or liable to bankruptcy by the <HI>humors</HI> of any particu|lar A&s;&s;embly.&mdash;In an <HI>E&s;&s;ay on Finance,</HI> which I de&s;ign &s;oon

<P>The delegates which are to form that augu&s;t body, which are to hold and exerci&s;e the &s;upreme authority, ought to be <HI>appointed by the States in any manner they plea&s;e; in which they &s;hould not be limited by any re&s;trictions;</HI> their own <HI>dignity</HI> and the <HI>weight</HI> they will hold in the great pub|lic councils, will always depend on the <HI>abilities</HI> of the per|&s;ons they appoint to repre&s;ent them there; and if they are wi&s;e enough to choo&s;e men of <HI>&s;ufficient abilities,</HI> and re|&s;pectable characters, men of &s;ound &s;en&s;e, exten&s;ive know|ledge, gravity, and integrity, they will reap the <HI>honor</HI> and <HI>advantage</HI> of &s;uch wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>But if they are <HI>fools enough</HI> to appoint men of <HI>trifling</HI> or <HI>vile characters,</HI> of <HI>mean abilities, faulty morals,</HI> or <HI>de&s;picable ignorance,</HI> they mu&s;t reap the <HI>fruits</HI> of &s;uch folly, and con|tent them&s;elves to have <HI>no weight, dignity,</HI> or <HI>e&s;teem</HI> in the public councils; and what is more to be lamented by the Commonwealth, to do <HI>no good there.</HI></P>
<P>I have no objection to the States electing and recalling their delegates as often as they plea&s;e, but think it hard and very injurious both to them and the Commonwealth, that they &s;hould be <HI>obliged to di&s;continue them after three years' &s;ervice,</HI> if they find them on that trial to be men of &s;ufficient integrity and abilities; a man of that experience is certainly much more qualified to &s;erve in the place, than a new member of equal good character can be; experience makes perfect in every kind of bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash;<HI>old, experienced &s;tate&s;men,</HI> of tried and approved integrity and abilities, are a great <HI>ble&s;&s;ing to a State</HI>&mdash;they acquire great authority and e&s;teem as well as wi&s;dom, and very much contribute to keep the &s;y&s;tem of government in good and &s;alutary order; and this furni&s;hes the &s;tronge&s;t rea&s;on why they &s;hould be continued in the &s;ervice, on <HI>Plato'</HI>s great maxim, that "the man <HI>be&s;t qualified</HI> to &s;erve, ought to be <HI>appointed".</HI></P>
<P>I am &s;orry to &s;ee a contrary maxim adopted in our <HI>Ame|rican</HI> coun&s;els; to make the <HI>highe&s;t rea&s;on</HI> that can be given for <HI>continuing a man in</HI> the public admini&s;tration, a&s;&s;igned as a <HI>con&s;titutional</HI> and <HI>ab&s;olute rea&s;on for turning him out,</HI>

<P>It &s;eems to me that a man's <HI>inducements to qualify him&s;elf for a public employment,</HI> and make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of it, mu&s;t be much di&s;couraged by this con&s;ideration, that let him take whatever pains to qualify him&s;elf in the be&s;t man|ner, he mu&s;t be &s;hortly <HI>turned out,</HI> and of cour&s;e it would be of more con&s;equence to him, to turn his attention to &s;ome other bu&s;ine&s;s, which he might adopt when his pre|&s;ent appointment &s;hould expire; and by this means the Commonwealth is in danger of lo&s;ing the zeal, indu&s;try, and &s;hining abilities, as well as &s;ervices, of their mo&s;t ac|compli&s;hed and valuable men.</P>
<P>I hear that the &s;tate of <HI>Georgia</HI> has improved on this ble&s;&s;ed principle, and limited the continuance of their go|vernors to <HI>one year;</HI> the con&s;equence is, they have already the <HI>gho&s;ts of departed governors &s;talking</HI> about in every part of their State, and growing more plenty every year; and as the price of every thing is reduced by its plenty, I can &s;uppo&s;e governors will &s;oon be very low there.</P>
<P>This <HI>doctrine of rotation</HI> was fir&s;t propo&s;ed by &s;ome &s;prightly geniu&s;es of brilliant politics, with this cogent rea&s;on; that by introducing a rotation in the public offices, we &s;hould have a great number of men trained up to public &s;ervice; but it appears to me that it will be more likely to produce many <HI>jacks at all trades,</HI> but <HI>good at none.</HI></P>
<P>I think that frequent elections are a &s;ufficient &s;ecurity again&s;t the continuance of men in public office who&s;e con|duct is not approved, and there can be no rea&s;on for ex|cluding
<PB N="206" REF="023972_0213_0FC2AE02EFD6B440">
tho&s;e who&s;e conduct is approved, and who are al|lowed to be better qualified than any men who can be found to &s;upply their places.</P>
<P>Another great object of government, is the <HI>apportionment of burdens and benefits;</HI> for if a <HI>greater quota</HI> of burden, or a <HI>le&s;s quota</HI> of benefit than is ju&s;t and right, be allotted to any State, this ill apportionment will be an everla&s;ting &s;ource of unea&s;ine&s;s and di&s;content. In the fir&s;t ca&s;e, the over-burdened State will complain; in the la&s;t ca&s;e, all the States, who&s;e quota of benefit is under-rated, will be un|ea&s;y; and this is a ca&s;e of &s;uch delicacy, that it cannot be &s;afely tru&s;ted to the arbitrary opinion or judgment of any body of men however augu&s;t.</P>
<P>Some natural principle of confe&s;&s;ed equity, and which can be reduced to a certainty, ought, if po&s;&s;ible, to be found and adopted; for it is of the highe&s;t moment to the Com|monwealth, to obviate, and, if po&s;&s;ible, wholly to take away, &s;uch a fruitful and common &s;ource of infinite di&s;|putes, as that of apportionment of quotas has ever proved in all States of the earth.</P>
<P>The <HI>value of lands</HI> may be a good rule; but the <HI>a&s;certain|ment of that value</HI> is impracticable; no a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment can be made which will not be liable to exception and debate&mdash;to adopt a good rule in any thing which is impracticable, is ab&s;urd; for it is phy&s;ically impo&s;&s;ible that any thing &s;hould be good for <HI>practice,</HI> which cannot be <HI>practi&s;ed</HI> at all;&mdash;but if the value of lands was capable of certain a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment, yet to adopt that value as a rule of apportionment of quo|tas, and at the &s;ame time to <HI>except from valuation</HI> large tracts of &s;undry States of immen&s;e value, which have all been defended by the joint arms of the whole Empire, and for the defence of which no additional quota of &s;upply is to be demanded of tho&s;e States, to whom &s;uch lands are &s;e|cured by &s;uch joint efforts of the States, is in its nature unrea&s;onable, and will open a door for great complaint.</P>
<P>It is plain without argument, that &s;uch States ought either to <HI>make grants</HI> to the Commonwealth of &s;uch tracts of de|fended territory, or <HI>&s;ell as much</HI> of them as will pay their proper quota of defence, and <HI>pay &s;uch &s;ums</HI> into the pub|lic
<PB N="207" REF="023972_0214_0FC2AE16E0F26AF0">
trea&s;ury; and this ought to be done, let what rule of quota &s;oever be adopted with re&s;pect to the cultivated part of the United States; for no propo&s;ition of natural right and ju&s;tice can be plainer than this, that every part of va|luable property which is <HI>defended,</HI> ought to contribute its quota of &s;upply for that <HI>defence.</HI></P>
<P>If then the value of cultivated lands is found to be an impracticable rule of apportionment of quotas, we have to &s;eek for &s;ome other, equally ju&s;t and le&s;s exceptionable.</P>
<P>It appears to me, that <HI>the number of living &s;ouls</HI> or <HI>hu|man per&s;ons</HI> of whatever age, &s;ex, or condition, will afford us a rule or mea&s;ure of apportionment which will for ever <HI>increa&s;e</HI> and <HI>decrea&s;e</HI> with the <HI>real wealth</HI> of the States, and will of cour&s;e be a <HI>perpetual rule,</HI> not capable of corruption by any circum&s;tances of future time; which is of va&s;t con&s;ideration in forming a con&s;titution which is de&s;igned for <HI>perpetual duration,</HI> and which will in its nature be as ju&s;t as to the inhabited parts of each State, as that of the value of lands, or any other that has or can be men|tioned.</P>
<P>Land takes its value not merely from the goodne&s;s of its &s;oil, but from innumerable other relative advantages, among which the population of the country may be con&s;idered as principal; as lands in a full-&s;ettled country will always <HI>(caeteris paribus)</HI> bring more than lands in thin &s;ettle|ments&mdash;On this principle, when the inhabitants of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia, Poland,</HI> &amp;c. &s;ell real e&s;tates, they do not value them as we do, by the <HI>number of acres,</HI> but by the <HI>number of people</HI> who live on them.</P>
<P>Where any piece of land has many advantages, many people will crowd there to obtain them; which will create many competitors for the purcha&s;e of it; which will of cour&s;e rai&s;e the price. Where there are fewer advantages, there will be fewer competitors, and of cour&s;e a le&s;s price; and the&s;e two things will for ever be proportionate to each other, and of cour&s;e the one will always be a &s;ure index of the other.</P>
<P>The only con&s;iderable objection I have ever heard to this, is, that the quality of inhabitants differs in the differ|ent
<PB N="208" REF="023972_0215_0FC2AE18AF369028">
States, and it is not rea&s;onable that the <HI>black &s;laves</HI> in the <HI>&s;outhern</HI> States &s;hould be e&s;timated on a par with the <HI>white freemen</HI> in the <HI>northern</HI> States. To di&s;cu&s;s this que&s;|tion fairly, I think it will be ju&s;t to e&s;timate the <HI>neat va|lue</HI> of the labor of both; and if it &s;hall appear that the labor of the black per&s;on produces as much neat wealth to the &s;outhern State, as the labor of the white per&s;on does to the northern State, I think it will follow plainly, that they are equally u&s;eful inhabitants in point of wealth; and therefore in the ca&s;e before us, &s;hould be e&s;timated alike.</P>
<P>And if the amazing profits which the &s;outhern planters boa&s;t of receiving from the labor of their &s;laves on their plantations, are <HI>real,</HI> the &s;outhern people have greatly the advantage in this kind of e&s;timation, and as this objection comes principally from the &s;outhward, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e that the gentlemen from that part would blu&s;h to urge it any further.</P>
<P>That the &s;upreme authority &s;hould be ve&s;ted with powers to <HI>terminate</HI> and <HI>finally decide controver&s;ies ari&s;ing between different States,</HI> I take it, will be univer&s;ally admitted, but I humbly apprehend that an <HI>appeal</HI> from the fir&s;t in&s;tance of trial ought to be admitted in cau&s;es of great moment, on the &s;ame rea&s;ons that &s;uch appeals are admitted in all the States of <HI>Europe.</HI> It is well known to all men ver&s;ed in courts, that the fir&s;t hearing of a cau&s;e, rather gives an opening to that evidence and rea&s;on which ought to de|cide it, than &s;uch a full examination and thorough di&s;cu&s;|&s;ion, as &s;hould always precede a final judgment, in cau&s;es of national con&s;equence.&mdash;A detail of rea&s;ons might be added, which I deem it unnece&s;&s;ary to enlarge on here.</P>
<P>The &s;upreme authority ought to have a power of <HI>peace and war,</HI> and forming <HI>treaties</HI> and <HI>alliances</HI> with all foreign powers; which implies a nece&s;&s;ity of their al&s;o having &s;uf|ficient powers to <HI>enforce the obedience</HI> of all &s;ubjects of the United States to &s;uch treaties and alliances; with <HI>full powers to unite the force</HI> of the States; and direct its ope|rations in war; and to puni&s;h all tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors in all the&s;e re&s;pects; otherwi&s;e, by the imprudence <HI>of a few,</HI> the whole Commonwealth may be embroiled with foreign

powers, and the operations of war may be rendered u&s;e|le&s;s, or fail much of their due effect.</P>
<P>All the&s;e I conceive will be ea&s;ily granted, e&s;pecially the latter, as the power of Congre&s;s to appoint and direct the army and navy in war, with all departments thereto be|longing, and puni&s;hing delinquents in them all, is already admitted into practice in the cour&s;e of the pre&s;ent unhap|py war, in which we have been long engaged.</P>
<P>II.

<P N="1">1.

<P>It is to be wi&s;hed that none might be appointed that were not <HI>fit</HI> and <HI>adequate</HI> to this weighty bu&s;ine&s;s; but a little knowledge of human nature, and a little acquaintance with the political hi&s;tory of mankind, will &s;oon teach us that this is not to be expected.</P>
<P>The repre&s;entatives appointed by popular elections are commonly not only the <HI>legal,</HI> but <HI>real,</HI> &s;ub&s;tantial repre|&s;entatives of their electors, <HI>i. e.</HI> there will commonly be about the <HI>&s;ame proportion</HI> of <HI>grave, &s;ound, well-qualified men,</HI>&mdash;<HI>trifling, de&s;ultory men,</HI>&mdash;<HI>wild</HI> or <HI>knavi&s;h &s;chemers,</HI>&mdash;and <HI>dull, ignorant fools,</HI> in the <HI>delegated a&s;&s;embly,</HI> as in the <HI>body of electors.</HI></P>

<P>We will &s;uppo&s;e then they are all met in Congre&s;s, clothed with that <HI>va&s;t authority</HI> which it is nece&s;&s;ary to the <HI>well-being,</HI> and even <HI>exi&s;tence, of the union,</HI> that they &s;hould be ve&s;ted with; how &s;hall we empower them to do all ne|ce&s;&s;ary and effectual <HI>good,</HI> and re&s;train them from doing <HI>hurt?</HI> To do this properly, I think we mu&s;t recur to tho&s;e <HI>natural motives</HI> of action, tho&s;e <HI>feelings</HI> and appre|hen&s;ions, which u&s;ually occur to the mind at the <HI>very time</HI> of action; for <HI>di&s;tant</HI> con&s;equences, however weighty, are often too much di&s;regarded.</P>

I do not believe there is a more natural truth in the world, than that divine one of our SAVIOUR, <HI>"he that doth truth, cometh to the light."</HI> I would therefore recommend that mode of deliberation, which will naturally bring on the mo&s;t thorough and cri|tical <HI>di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the &s;ubject,</HI> previous to pa&s;&s;ing any act; and for that purpo&s;e humbly propo&s;e,</P>

<P>Under the&s;e circum&s;tances, a man of ignorance or evil de&s;ign will be afraid to impo&s;e on the credulity, inatten|tion, or confidence of his hou&s;e, by introducing any <HI>cor|rupt</HI> or <HI>indige&s;ted propo&s;ition,</HI> which he knows he mu&s;t be called on to defend again&s;t the <HI>&s;evere &s;crutiny</HI> and <HI>poignant objections</HI> of the other hou&s;e. I do not believe the many hurtful and fooli&s;h legi&s;lative acts which fir&s;t or la&s;t have injured all the States on earth, have originated &s;o much in corruption as indolence, ignorance, and a want of a full comprehen&s;ion of the &s;ubject, which a full, prying, and emulous di&s;cu&s;&s;ion would tend in a great mea&s;ure to remove: this naturally rou&s;es the lazy and idle, who hate the pain of clo&s;e thinking; animates the ambitious to excel in policy and argument; and excites the whole to &s;upport the dignity of their hou&s;e, and vindicate their own propo|&s;itions.</P>
<P>I am not of opinion that bodies of elective men, which u&s;ually compo&s;e <HI>Parliaments, Diets, A&s;&s;emblies, Congre&s;&s;es,</HI> &amp;c. are commonly <HI>di&s;hone&s;t;</HI> but I believe it rarely happens that there are not <HI>de&s;igning men</HI> among them; and I think it would be much more difficult for them to unite their parti&s;ans in two hou&s;es, and corrupt or deceive them both, than to carry on their de&s;igns where there is but <HI>one un|alarmed, unapprehen&s;ive</HI> hou&s;e to be managed; and as there is <HI>no hope</HI> of making the&s;e bad men good, the be&s;t policy is to <HI>embarra&s;s</HI> them, and make their work as <HI>difficult</HI> as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>In the&s;e a&s;&s;emblies are frequently to be found &s;anguine men, upright enough indeed, but of &s;trong, wild projec|tion, who&s;e brains are always teeming with <HI>Utopian, chime|rical plans,</HI> and <HI>political whims,</HI> very de&s;tructive to &s;ociety.

<P>The con&s;ultations and deci&s;ions of national councils are &s;o very important, that the <HI>fate of millions</HI> depends on them; therefore no man ought to &s;peak in &s;uch a&s;&s;emblies, without con&s;idering that the fate of millions <HI>hangs on his tongue,</HI>&mdash;and of cour&s;e a man can have no right in &s;uch augu&s;t councils to utter indige&s;ted &s;entiments, or indulge him&s;elf in &s;udden, unexamined flights of thought; his mo&s;t tried and improved abilities are due to the State, who have tru&s;ted him with their mo&s;t important intere&s;ts.</P>

<P>TRADE is of &s;uch e&s;&s;ential importance to our intere&s;ts, and &s;o intimately connected with all our &s;taples, great and
<PB N="216" REF="023972_0223_0FC2AE420CD0BB30">
&s;mall, that no &s;ources of our wealth can flouri&s;h, and ope|rate to the general benefit of the community, <HI>without it.</HI> Our <HI>hu&s;bandry,</HI> that grand &s;taple of our country, can ne|ver exceed our home con&s;umption <HI>without this</HI>&mdash;it is plain at fir&s;t &s;ight, that the <HI>farmer</HI> will not toil and &s;weat thro' the year to rai&s;e great plenty of the produce of the &s;oil, if there is <HI>no market</HI> for his produce, when he has it ready for &s;ale, <HI>i. e.</HI> if there are no merchants to buy it.</P>
<P>In like manner, the <HI>manufacturer</HI> will not lay out his bu|&s;ine&s;s on any large &s;cale, if there is no merchant to buy his fabrics when he has fini&s;hed them; a <HI>vent</HI> is of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential importance to every manufacturing coun|try&mdash;the merchants, therefore, become the natural negotia|tors of the wealth of the country, who take off the <HI>abun|dance,</HI> and &s;upply the <HI>wants,</HI> of the inhabitants;&mdash;and as this negotiation is the bu&s;ine&s;s of their lives, and the &s;ource of their own wealth, they of cour&s;e become better acquainted with both our abundance and wants, and are more intere&s;ted in finding and improving the be&s;t <HI>vent</HI> for the one, and <HI>&s;upply</HI> of the other, than any other men among us, and they have a natural intere&s;t in making both the purcha&s;e and &s;upply as convenient to their cu&s;tomers as po&s;&s;ible, that they may &s;ecure their cu&s;tom, and thereby increa&s;e their own bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>It follows then, that the merchants are not only <HI>qualified to give the fulle&s;t and mo&s;t important information</HI> to our &s;u|preme legi&s;lature, concerning the &s;tate of our trade&mdash;the abundance and wants,&mdash;the wealth and poverty, of our people, <HI>i. e.</HI> their mo&s;t important intere&s;ts, but are al&s;o the mo&s;t likely to do it <HI>fairly</HI> and <HI>truly,</HI> and to forward with their influence, every mea&s;ure which will operate to the convenience and benefit of our commerce, and oppo&s;e with their whole weight and &s;uperior knowledge of the &s;ubject, any <HI>wild &s;chemes,</HI> which an ignorant or arbitrary legi&s;lature may attempt to introduce, to the hurt and em|barra&s;&s;ment of our intercour&s;e both with one another, and with foreigners.</P>
<P>The States of <HI>Venice</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> have ever been govern|ed by <HI>merchants,</HI> or at lea&s;t their policy has ever been
<PB N="217" REF="023972_0224_0FC2AE439D469930">
under the great influence of that &s;ort of men. No States have been better &s;erved, as appears by their great &s;ucce&s;s, the ea&s;e and happine&s;s of their citizens, as well as the &s;trength and riches of their Commonwealths: the one is the <HI>olde&s;t,</HI> and the other the <HI>riche&s;t,</HI> State in the world of equal number of people&mdash;the one has maintained &s;undry wars with the <HI>Grand Turk</HI>&mdash;and the other has with&s;tood the power of <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>France;</HI> and the <HI>capitals</HI> of both have long been the principal marts of the &s;everal parts of <HI>Europe</HI> in which they are &s;ituated; and the <HI>banks</HI> of both are the be&s;t &s;upported, and in the be&s;t credit, of any <HI>banks in Europe,</HI> tho' their countries or territories are very &s;mall, and their inhabitants but a handful, when compared with the great States in their neighbourhood.</P>
<P>Merchants mu&s;t, from the nature of their bu&s;ine&s;s, cer|tainly under&s;tand the intere&s;ts and re&s;ources of their coun|try, the be&s;t of any men in it; and I know not of <HI>any one rea&s;on</HI> why they &s;hould be deemed <HI>le&s;s upright or patriotic,</HI> than any other rank of citizens whatever.</P>
<P>I therefore humbly propo&s;e, if the merchants in the &s;e|veral States are di&s;po&s;ed to &s;end delegates from their body, to meet and attend the &s;itting of Congre&s;s, that they &s;hall be permitted to form a <HI>chamber of commerce,</HI> and <HI>their ad|vice</HI> to Congre&s;s be <HI>demanded and admitted</HI> concerning all bills before Congre&s;s, as far as the &s;ame may affect the <HI>trade of the States.</HI></P>
<P>I have no idea that the continent is made for Congre&s;s: I take them to be no more than the upper &s;ervants of the great political body, who are to find out things by <HI>&s;tudy and inquiry</HI> as other people do; and therefore I think it nece&s;&s;ary to place them under the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible advantages for information, and to require them to improve all tho&s;e advantages, to qualify them&s;elves in the be&s;t manner po&s;&s;i|ble, for the wi&s;e and u&s;eful di&s;charge of the va&s;t tru&s;t and mighty authority repo&s;ed in them; and as I conceive the advice of the merchants to be one of the greate&s;t &s;ources of mercantile information, which is any where placed within their reach, it ought by no means to be neglected,
<PB N="218" REF="023972_0225_0FC2AE64AAD0B180">
but &s;o hu&s;banded and improved, that the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible advantages may be derived from it.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, I have another rea&s;on why the merchants ought to be con&s;ulted; I take it to be very plain that the hu&s;bandry and manufactures of the country mu&s;t be ruin|ed, if the pre&s;ent weight of taxes is continued on them much longer, and of cour&s;e a very great part of our reve|nue mu&s;t ari&s;e from <HI>impo&s;ts on merchandi&s;e,</HI> which will fall directly within the merchants' &s;phere of bu&s;ine&s;s, and of cour&s;e their concurrence and advice will be of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence, not only to direct the propere&s;t mode of le|vying tho&s;e duties, but al&s;o to get them carried into quiet and peaceable execution</P>
<P>No men are more conver&s;ant with the citizens, or more intimately connected with their intere&s;ts, than the mer|chants, and therefore their weight and influence will have a mighty effect on the minds of the people. I do not re|collect an in&s;tance, in which the Court of <HI>London</HI> ever re|jected the remon&s;trances and advices of the merchants, and did not &s;uffer &s;everely for their pride. We have &s;ome &s;triking in&s;tances of this in the di&s;regarded advices and re|mon&s;trances of very many <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> merchants again&s;t the <HI>American</HI> war, and their fears and apprehen&s;ions we &s;ee verified, almo&s;t like prophecies, by the event.</P>
<P>I know not why I &s;hould continue this argument any longer, or indeed why I have urged it &s;o long, in as much as I cannot conceive that Congre&s;s or any body el&s;e will deem it below the dignity of the &s;upreme power to con&s;ult &s;o important an order of men, in matters of the fir&s;t con|&s;equence, which fall immediately under their notice, and in which their experience, and of cour&s;e their knowledge and advice are preferable to tho&s;e of any other order of men.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the benefits which Congre&s;s may receive from this in&s;titution, <HI>a chamber of commerce,</HI> compo&s;ed of mem|bers from <HI>all trading towns</HI> in the States, if properly in&s;ti|tuted and conducted, will prod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> many, I might al|mo&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> utility to all the States&mdash;it will give dignity, uniformity, and &s;afety to

<P>It may be objected to all this, that the <HI>le&s;s complex</HI> and the <HI>more &s;imple</HI> every con&s;titution is, the <HI>nearer it comes to perfection:</HI> this argument would be very good, and afford a very forcible conclu&s;ion, if the government of <HI>men</HI> was like that of the <HI>Almighty,</HI> always founded on wi&s;dom, knowledge, and truth; but in the pre&s;ent imperfect &s;tate of human nature, where the be&s;t of men know but <HI>in part,</HI> and mu&s;t recur to advice and information <HI>for the re&s;t,</HI> it certainly becomes nece&s;&s;ary to form a con&s;titution on &s;uch principles, as will &s;ecure <HI>that information</HI> and <HI>advice</HI> in the be&s;t and &s;ure&s;t manner po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>It may be further objected that the forms herein pro|po&s;ed will <HI>embarra&s;s the bu&s;ine&s;s</HI> of Congre&s;s, and make it at be&s;t <HI>&s;low and dilatory.</HI> As far as this form will prevent the hurrying a bill thro' the hou&s;e without due examina|tion, the <HI>objection</HI> it&s;elf becomes an <HI>advantage</HI>&mdash;at mo&s;t the&s;e checks on the &s;upreme authority can have no further effect than to <HI>delay or de&s;troy a good bill,</HI> but cannot <HI>pa&s;s a bad one;</HI> and I think it much better in the main, to <HI>lo&s;e a good bill</HI> than to &s;uffer a <HI>bad one to pa&s;s</HI> into a law.&mdash;Be&s;ides it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that clear, plain ca&s;es will meet with embarra&s;&s;ment, and it is mo&s;t &s;afe that untried, doubt|ful, difficult matters &s;hould pa&s;s thro' the grave&s;t and fulle&s;t di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, before the &s;anction of law is given to them.</P>
<P>But what is to be done if the <HI>two hou&s;es grow jealous and ill-natured,</HI> and after all their information and advice, grow out of humor and in&s;incere, and <HI>no concurrence can be ob|tained?</HI>&mdash;I

<P>It is however an ill compliment to &s;o many grave per|&s;onages, to &s;uppo&s;e them capable of throwing a&s;ide their rea&s;on, and giving them&s;elves up like children to the con|trol of their pa&s;&s;ions; or, if this &s;hould happen for a <HI>mo|ment,</HI> that it &s;hould continue any <HI>length of time,</HI> is hardly to be pre&s;umed of a body of men placed in &s;uch high &s;ta|tions of <HI>dignity</HI> and <HI>importance,</HI> with the <HI>eyes of all the world</HI> upon them&mdash;but if they &s;hould, after all, be capable of this, I think it madne&s;s to &s;et them to making laws, during &s;uch fits&mdash;it is be&s;t, when they are in <HI>no condition to do good,</HI> to keep them <HI>from doing hurt,</HI>&mdash;and if they do not grow wi&s;er in rea&s;onable time, I know of nothing better, than to be a&s;hamed of our old appointments, and make new ones.</P>

To appoint a Congre&s;s with powers to do <HI>all acts ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the &s;upport and u&s;es of the union;</HI> and at the &s;ame time to leave all the States at liberty to <HI>obey them or not with impunity,</HI> is, in every view, the gro&s;&s;e&s;t <HI>ab&s;urdity,</HI> wor&s;e than a &s;tate of nature without any &s;upreme authori|ty at all, and at be&s;t a ridiculous effort of childi&s;h non|&s;en&s;e: and of cour&s;e,</P>
<P N="4">4. Every State in the Union is under the highe&s;t obliga|tions <HI>to obey the &s;upreme authority of the whole,</HI> and in the <HI>highe&s;t degree amenable to it,</HI> and &s;ubject to the <HI>highe&s;t cen|&s;ure for di&s;obedience</HI>&mdash;Yet all this notwith&s;tanding, I think the &s;oul that &s;ins &s;hould die, <HI>i. e.</HI> the cen&s;ure of the great &s;upreme power, ought to be &s;o directed, if po&s;&s;ible, as to light on tho&s;e per&s;ons, who have betrayed their country, and expo&s;ed it to di&s;&s;olution, by oppo&s;ing and rejecting that &s;upreme authority, which is the <HI>band of our union,</HI> and from whence proceeds the <HI>principal &s;trength and energy</HI> of our government.</P>
<P>I therefore propo&s;e, that every <HI>per&s;on</HI> whatever, whe|ther in <HI>public</HI> or <HI>private character,</HI> who &s;hall, by <HI>public vote</HI> or other <HI>overt act, di&s;obey the &s;upreme authority,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> be <HI>amenable to Congre&s;s,</HI> &s;hall be <HI>&s;ummoned and compelled to ap|pear</HI> before Congre&s;s, and, on due conviction, <HI>&s;uffer &s;uch fine, impri&s;onment, or other puni&s;hment,</HI> as the &s;upreme au|thority &s;hall judge requi&s;ite.</P>
<P>It may be objected here, that this will make a Member of A&s;&s;embly accountable to Congre&s;s for his vote in A&s;&s;em|bly; I an&s;wer, it does &s;o <HI>in this only ca&s;e,</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> when that vote <HI>is to di&s;obey the &s;upreme authority:</HI> no Member of A&s;|&s;embly can have right to give <HI>&s;uch a vote,</HI> and therefore ought to be puni&s;hed for &s;o doing&mdash;When the &s;upreme authority is di&s;obeyed, the government mu&s;t lo&s;e its energy

and effect, and of cour&s;e the Empire mu&s;t be &s;haken to its very foundation.</P>
<P>A government which is but <HI>half executed,</HI> or who&s;e <HI>ope|rations may all be &s;topped by a &s;ingle vote,</HI> is the mo&s;t <HI>dange|rous of all in&s;titutions.</HI>&mdash;See the pre&s;ent <HI>Poland,</HI> and anci|ent <HI>Greece</HI> buried in ruins, in con&s;equence of this fatal error in their policy. A government which has not energy and effect, can never afford protection or &s;ecurity to its &s;ub|jects, <HI>i. e.</HI> mu&s;t ever be ineffectual to its own ends.</P>
<P>I cannot therefore admit, that the great ends of our Union &s;hould lie at the mercy of a &s;ingle State, or that the energy of our government &s;hould be checked by a &s;in|gle di&s;obedience, or that &s;uch di&s;obedience &s;hould ever be &s;heltered from cen&s;ure and puni&s;hment; the con&s;equence is too capital, too fatal to be admitted. Even tho' I know very well that a &s;upreme authority, with all its dignity and importance, is &s;ubject to pa&s;&s;ions like other le&s;&s;er pow|ers, that they may be and often are heated, violent, op|pre&s;&s;ive, and very tyrannical; yet I know al&s;o, that per|fection is not to be hoped for in this life, and we mu&s;t take all in&s;titutions with their natural defects, or reject them altogether: I will guard again&s;t the&s;e abu&s;es of pow|er as far as po&s;&s;ible, but I cannot give up all government, or de&s;troy its nece&s;&s;ary energy, for fear of the&s;e abu&s;es.</P>
<P>But to fence them out as far as po&s;&s;ible, and to give the States as great a check on the &s;upreme authority, as can con&s;i&s;t with its nece&s;&s;ary energy and effect,</P>
<P>I propo&s;e that any State may petition Congre&s;s to repeal any law or deci&s;ion which they have made, and if <HI>more than half the States</HI> do this, the <HI>law or deci&s;ion &s;hall be re|pealed,</HI> let its nature or importance be however great, ex|cepting only &s;uch acts as <HI>create funds for the public credit,</HI> which &s;hall never be repealed till their end is effected, or other funds equally effectual are &s;ub&s;tituted in their places; but Congre&s;s &s;hall not be obliged to repeal any of the&s;e acts, &s;o petitioned again&s;t, till they have time to lay the rea&s;ons of &s;uch acts before &s;uch petitioning States, and to receive their an&s;wer; becau&s;e &s;uch petitions may ari&s;e from &s;udden heats, popular prejudices, or the publication
<PB N="225" REF="023972_0232_0FC2AE9A0C69BFE8">
of matters fal&s;e in fact, and may require time and means of cool reflection and the fulle&s;t information, before the final deci&s;ion is made: but if after all, <HI>more than half</HI> the States per&s;i&s;t in their demand of a repeal, it &s;hall take place.</P>
<P>The rea&s;on is, the <HI>unea&s;ine&s;s of a majority</HI> of States af|fords a &s;trong <HI>pre&s;umption</HI> that the act is <HI>wrong,</HI> for unea|&s;ine&s;s ari&s;es much more frequently from <HI>wrong</HI> than <HI>right;</HI> but if the act was <HI>good and right,</HI> it would &s;till be better to <HI>repeal</HI> and <HI>lo&s;e</HI> it, than to <HI>force</HI> the execution of it again&s;t the opinion of a <HI>major part</HI> of the States; and la&s;tly, if every act of Congre&s;s is &s;ubject to this repeal, Congre&s;s it&s;elf will have <HI>&s;tronger inducement</HI> not only to examine well the &s;everal acts under their con&s;ideration, but al&s;o to <HI>communicate the rea&s;ons</HI> of them to the States, than they would have, if their &s;imple vote gave <HI>the final &s;tamp of irrevocable authority</HI> to their acts.</P>
<P>Further I propo&s;e, that if the <HI>execution of any act or order of the &s;upreme authority &s;hall be oppo&s;ed by force in any of the States</HI> (which God forbid!) it &s;hall be lawful for Congre&s;s to &s;end into &s;uch State <HI>a &s;ufficient force to &s;uppre&s;s it.</HI></P>
<P>On the whole, I take it that the very <HI>exi&s;tence and u&s;e of our union</HI> e&s;&s;entially depends on the <HI>full energy and final effect</HI> of the laws made to &s;upport it; and therefore I <HI>&s;acrifice all other con&s;iderations to this energy and effect,</HI> and if our UNION is not worth this purcha&s;e, we mu&s;t give it up&mdash;the <HI>nature of the thing</HI> does not admit any other alternative.</P>
<P>I do contend that <HI>our UNION is worth this purcha&s;e</HI>&mdash;<HI>with it,</HI> every individual re&s;ts &s;ecure under its protection again&s;t foreign or dome&s;tic in&s;ult and oppre&s;&s;ion&mdash;<HI>without it,</HI> we can have no &s;ecurity again&s;t the oppre&s;&s;ion, in&s;ult, and in|va&s;ion of foreign powers; for no &s;ingle State is of im|portance enough to be an object of treaty with them, nor, if it was, could it bear the expen&s;e of &s;uch treaties, or &s;upport any character or re&s;pect in a di&s;&s;evered &s;tate, but mu&s;t lo&s;e all re&s;pectability among the nations abroad.</P>
<P>We have a very <HI>exten&s;ive trade,</HI> which cannot be carried on with &s;ecurity and advantage, <HI>without treaties</HI> of com|merce and alliance with foreign nations.</P>

<P>I conclude then, that our UNION is not only of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential con&s;equence to the well-being of the States in ge|neral, but to that of every individual citizen of them, and of cour&s;e ought to be &s;upported, and made as u&s;eful and &s;afe as po&s;&s;ible, by a con&s;titution which admits that <HI>full energy</HI> and <HI>final effect of government which alone can &s;ecure its great ends and u&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>In a di&s;&s;ertation of this &s;ort, I would not wi&s;h to de&s;cend to <HI>minutiae,</HI> yet there are &s;ome &s;mall matters which have important con&s;equences, and therefore ought to be noticed.

<P>Where there is &s;uch a va&s;t authority and tru&s;t devolved on Congre&s;s, and the grand and mo&s;t important intere&s;ts of the Empire re&s;t on their deci&s;ions, it appears to me highly unrea&s;onable that we &s;hould &s;uffer their <HI>augu&s;t con|&s;ultations to be &s;u&s;pended,</HI> or their <HI>dignity, authority,</HI> and <HI>in|fluence le&s;&s;ened</HI> by the <HI>idlene&s;s, neglect, and non-attendance</HI> of its members; for we know that the acts of a <HI>thin hou&s;e</HI> do not u&s;ually carry with them the &s;ame degree of weight and re&s;pect as tho&s;e of a <HI>full</HI> hou&s;e.</P>

<P>I have one argument in favor of my whole plan, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> it is &s;o formed that no men of <HI>dull</HI> intellects, or <HI>&s;mall knowledge,</HI> or of <HI>habits too idle</HI> for con&s;tant attendance, or clo&s;e and &s;teady attention, can do the bu&s;ine&s;s with any to|lerable degree of re&s;pectability, nor can they find either honor, profit, or &s;atisfaction in being there, and of cour&s;e, I could wi&s;h that the choice of the electors might never fall on <HI>&s;uch a man,</HI> or if it &s;hould, that he might have <HI>&s;en&s;e enough</HI> (of <HI>pain</HI> at lea&s;t, if not of <HI>&s;hame</HI>) to decline his acceptance.</P>
<P>For after all that can be done, I do not think that a good admini&s;tration depends wholly on a good con&s;titution and good laws, for in&s;ufficient or bad men will always make <HI>bad work,</HI> and <HI>a bad admini&s;tration,</HI> let the <HI>con&s;titution and laws be ever &s;o good;</HI> the management of able, faith|ful, and upright men alone can cau&s;e an admini&s;tra|tion to <HI>brighten,</HI> and the <HI>dignity</HI> and <HI>wi&s;dom</HI> of an Empire to <HI>ri&s;e into re&s;pect;</HI> make <HI>truth</HI> the line and mea&s;ure of <HI>pub|lic deci&s;ion;</HI> give <HI>weight</HI> and <HI>authority</HI> to the government, and <HI>&s;ecurity</HI> and <HI>peace</HI> to the &s;ubject.</P>

<P>It is a pity we &s;hould lo&s;e the honor and ble&s;&s;ings which have co&s;t us &s;o dear, for want of wi&s;dom and firmne&s;s in mea&s;ures, which are e&s;&s;ential to our pre&s;ervation.

A man mu&s;t always depend for &s;upply on tho&s;e articles which he can <HI>be&s;t &s;pare,</HI> or which he can furni&s;h with <HI>lea&s;t</HI> inconvenience: he &s;hould fir&s;t &s;ell &s;uch articles as he has <HI>purpo&s;ely provided for market:</HI> if the&s;e are not enough, then &s;uch articles of his e&s;tate as he can <HI>be&s;t &s;pare,</HI> always &s;acrificing <HI>luxuries fir&s;t,</HI> and nece&s;&s;aries <HI>la&s;t</HI> of all.</P>
<P>II. <HI>Any intere&s;t or thing whatever, on which the burden of tax is laid, is dimini&s;hed either in quantity or neat value, e. g.</HI> if <HI>money</HI> is taxed, part of the &s;um goes to pay the tax; if <HI>lands,</HI> part of the produce or price goes to pay it; if <HI>goods,</HI> part of the price which the goods will &s;ell for, goes to pay it, &amp;c.</P>
<P>III. <HI>The con&s;umption of any thing, on which the burden of tax is laid, will always be thereby le&s;&s;ened,</HI> becau&s;e &s;uch tax will <HI>rai&s;e</HI> the price of the article taxed, and fewer people will be able or willing to pay <HI>&s;uch advance</HI> of price, than would purcha&s;e, if the price was <HI>not rai&s;ed:</HI> and con&s;e|quently,</P>
<P>IV. <HI>The burden of tax ought to lie heavie&s;t on &s;uch arti|cles, the u&s;e and con&s;umption of which are lea&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to the community; and lighte&s;t on tho&s;e articles, the u&s;e and con|&s;umption
<PB N="232" REF="023972_0239_0FC2AEB8B61834A0">
of which are mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to the community.</HI> I think this &s;o plain, that it cannot need any thing &s;aid on it either by way of illu&s;tration or proof.</P>
<P>V. <HI>The &s;taples of any country are both the &s;ource and mea|&s;ure of its wealth,</HI> and therefore ought to be <HI>encouraged and increa&s;ed</HI> as far as po&s;&s;ible. No country can enjoy or con|&s;ume more than they can rai&s;e, make, or purcha&s;e. No country can purcha&s;e more than they can pay for; and no country can make payment beyond the amount of the <HI>&s;ur|plus</HI> which remains of their &s;taples, after their <HI>con&s;umption</HI> is &s;ubtracted. If they go beyond this, they mu&s;t run in debt, <HI>i. e.</HI> eat the calf in the cow's belly, or con&s;ume this year the proceeds of the next, which is a direct &s;tep to ruin, and mu&s;t (if continued) end in de&s;truction.</P>
<P>VI. <HI>The great &s;taples of the Thirteen United States, are our</HI> HUSBANDRY, FISHERIES, AND MANUFACTURES. <HI>Trade</HI> comes in as the <HI>hand-maid</HI> of them all&mdash;the <HI>&s;ervant</HI> that tends upon them&mdash;the <HI>nur&s;e</HI> that takes away their re|dundancies, and &s;upplies their wants. <HI>The&s;e</HI> we may con|&s;ider as the great <HI>&s;ources</HI> of our wealth; and our <HI>trade,</HI> as the great <HI>conduit</HI> thro' which it flows. All the&s;e we ought in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound policy to guard, encourage, and increa&s;e <HI>as far as po&s;&s;ible,</HI> and to load them with burdens and em|barra&s;&s;ments <HI>as little</HI> as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>VII. When any country finds that any articles are grow|ing into u&s;e, and their con&s;umption increa&s;ing &s;o far as to become hurtful to the pro&s;perity of the people, or to cor|rupt their morals or economy, <HI>it is the intere&s;t and good po|licy of &s;uch country to check and dimini&s;h the u&s;e and con&s;ump|tion of &s;uch articles,</HI> down to &s;uch degree as &s;hall con&s;i&s;t with the greate&s;t happine&s;s and purity of their people.</P>
<P>VIII. This is done the mo&s;t effectually and unexcepti|onably, by <HI>taxing &s;uch articles, and thereby rai&s;ing the price of them &s;o high,</HI> as &s;hall be nece&s;&s;ary to <HI>reduce</HI> their con|&s;umption, as far as is needful for the general good. The force of this ob&s;ervation has been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">elt by all nations; and <HI>&s;umptuary laws</HI> have been tried in all &s;hapes, to <HI>prevent or reduce</HI> &s;uch hurtful con&s;umptions; but none ever did or can do it &s;o effectually as <HI>rai&s;ing the price of them:</HI> this touches the
<PB N="233" REF="023972_0240_0FC2AED0B4ADFE10">
feelings of every purcha&s;er, and connects the u&s;e of &s;uch articles with the pain of the purcha&s;er, who cannot afford them, &s;o clo&s;ely and con&s;tantly, as cannot fail to operate by way of <HI>diminution</HI> or <HI>di&s;u&s;e</HI> of &s;uch con&s;umption; and as to &s;uch rich or prodigal people, as can or will go to the price of &s;uch articles, they are the very per&s;ons who, I think, are the mo&s;t able and &s;uitable to pay taxes to the State.</P>
<P>I think it would not be difficult to enumerate a great number of &s;uch articles of <HI>luxury, pride, or mere ornament,</HI> which are growing into &s;uch exce&s;&s;ive u&s;e among us, as to become dangerous to the <HI>wealth, economy, morals,</HI> and <HI>health</HI> of our people, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>di&s;tilled &s;pirits</HI> of all &s;orts, e&s;pe|cially whi&s;ky and country rum, all imported <HI>wines, &s;ilks</HI> of all &s;orts, <HI>cambrics, lawns, laces,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. <HI>&s;uperfine cloths and velvets, jewels</HI> of all kinds, &amp;c. to which might be added a very large catalogue of articles, tho' not &s;o <HI>capi|tally</HI> dangerous as the&s;e, yet &s;uch as would admit <HI>a check</HI> in their con&s;umption, without any damage to the States, &s;uch as <HI>&s;ugar, tea, coffee, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, fine linens,</HI> all <HI>cloths and &s;tuffs</HI> generally u&s;ed by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he <HI>richer kind</HI> of people, &amp;c. all which may be judiciou&s;ly taxed at <HI>ten, twenty, fifty,</HI> or <HI>one hundred per cent.</HI> on their fir&s;t importation; and to the&s;e might be added, a &s;mall duty of perhaps <HI>five per cent.</HI> on all other imported goods whatever.</P>
<P>Two things are here to be con&s;idered and proved. 1. That <HI>this mode</HI> of taxation would be more <HI>beneficial</HI> to the com|munity than any other: and, 2. that this mode is <HI>prac|ticable.</HI> If the&s;e two things are fairly and clearly proved, I think there can be no room left for doubt, whether this kind of taxation ought to be immediately adopted, and put in practice.</P>
<P>I will offer my rea&s;ons in favor of the&s;e propo&s;itions as fully, clearly, and truly as I can, and hope they may be judged worthy of a candid attention. I will endeavour in the fir&s;t place, to point out <HI>the benefits ari&s;ing from this mode of taxation.</HI></P>
<P>I. This mode of taxation may &s;afely be rai&s;ed to &s;uch a degree, as <HI>to produce all the money we need for the public &s;er|vice,</HI>
<PB N="234" REF="023972_0241_0FC2AED21C744188">
or &s;ufficiently <HI>near</HI> it; perhaps a <HI>&s;mall tax</HI> in the or|dinary way would be more beneficial to the States than <HI>none,</HI> becau&s;e this tax keeps the cu&s;tomary avenues from the wealth of individuals to the public trea&s;ury always open, which may be u&s;ed on emergencies, and the <HI>habit and practice</HI> being &s;ettled, would avoid the difficulties natu|rally ari&s;ing from <HI>novelty</HI> or <HI>innovations.</HI></P>
<P>But to return to my argument. It is greatly in favor of this kind of tax, that it will bring money <HI>enough</HI> for the public &s;ervice; it is matter of great animation in the pur|&s;uit of any object, to know that, when accompli&s;hed, it will be <HI>adequate to its purpo&s;es.</HI> People all want to &s;ee the <HI>end of things,</HI> and to know when they are to <HI>have done:</HI> this will naturally produce much &s;tronger efforts, vigor, and cheerfulne&s;s, than if the thing, when accompli&s;hed, would be but <HI>half adequate</HI> to its purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>II. This mode of taxation <HI>applies for money where it is to be had in greate&s;t plenty, and can be paid with mo&s;t ea&s;e and lea&s;t pain.</HI> If we apply to the <HI>farmer, trade&s;man,</HI> or <HI>la|borer</HI> for ca&s;h, they have mighty little of it, and it is hard for them to rai&s;e the nece&s;&s;ary &s;um; but it is matter of <HI>common cour&s;e</HI> with the merchant, <HI>thro' who&s;e hands the great current of circulating ca&s;h pa&s;&s;es;</HI> he will con&s;ider the tax as part of the <HI>fir&s;t co&s;t</HI> of his goods, and &s;et his price and &s;ell accordingly: it matters little to him, whether he <HI>pays half</HI> the co&s;t of his goods <HI>abroad,</HI> and the <HI>other half at home,</HI> or whether he pays it all abroad; his object is to get the whole out of his &s;ales, with as much profit to him&s;elf as he can.</P>
<P>III. This mode <HI>lays the burden of tax on that kind of con|&s;umption which is exce&s;&s;ive and hurtful, and le&s;&s;ens that con|&s;umption, and of cour&s;e mends the economy, and increa&s;es the indu&s;try and health, of the people.</HI> For it is plain, that <HI>no more money</HI> will be paid for the goods taxed, than would have been paid for the &s;ame kind of goods, had they <HI>not</HI> been taxed: the difference is, the &s;ame money paid for the taxed goods will not buy <HI>&s;o many</HI> of them as before the tax, becau&s;e the tax will <HI>rai&s;e the price</HI> of them.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="023972_0242_0FC2AEE9E46E2C00">
And when the con&s;umption or u&s;e of &s;uch goods is ex|ce&s;&s;ive and hurtful, this <HI>le&s;&s;ening</HI> of it is a <HI>benefit,</HI> tho' the &s;ame money is paid for them as before, for the &s;ame rea&s;on that it is better for a man that happens to be at a tavern with exce&s;&s;ive drinkers, to pay his <HI>whole &s;hare of the reckon|ing,</HI> but drink <HI>le&s;s than his &s;hare</HI> of the liquors, and <HI>go home &s;ober,</HI> than to pay the <HI>&s;ame</HI> reckoning, drink his <HI>full &s;hare</HI> of the liquors, and <HI>go home drunk.</HI> It is always bet|ter for a man to buy poi&s;on and <HI>not u&s;e</HI> it, than to buy the &s;ame poi&s;on and <HI>u&s;e</HI> it; in the one ca&s;e he lo&s;es nothing but his <HI>money,</HI> in the other ca&s;e he lo&s;es his money and <HI>health</HI> too. For the &s;ame rea&s;on it is better for a reaper to drink <HI>half a pint</HI> of rum in a day, than to reap for the &s;ame wages, and drink a <HI>quart</HI> of rum. This rea&s;oning will hold in its proper degree, with re&s;pect to every kind of con&s;umption which is exce&s;&s;ive and hurtful.</P>
<P>IV. This mode of taxation <HI>&s;aves the whole &s;um of the tax to the States,</HI> while at the &s;ame time <HI>it mends the habits and health of the people:</HI> for it is plain, that if the con&s;umption of &s;uch imported goods is le&s;&s;ened by the tax, <HI>a le&s;s quan|tity</HI> will be <HI>imported,</HI> and of cour&s;e a <HI>le&s;s</HI> &s;um of money need be <HI>&s;ent abroad</HI> to pay the fir&s;t co&s;t of the&s;e goods; and this exce&s;s of money, which is thus &s;aved from going abroad (from whence it <HI>would never return</HI>) is paid by the tax into the <HI>public trea&s;ury,</HI> from whence it i&s;&s;ues on the public &s;ervice, and is directly thrown <HI>into circulation again</HI> thro' the States, and of cour&s;e becomes a <HI>clear &s;aving,</HI> or balance of increa&s;e of the circulating medium, and con&s;e|quently of <HI>realized</HI> wealth in the country; whil&s;t at the &s;ame time, the people are better &s;erved and accommodated by the <HI>reduced</HI> con&s;umption, than they could have been by the <HI>exce&s;&s;ive</HI> one.</P>
<P>V. It appears from what has been ju&s;t now ob&s;erved, that <HI>this mode of taxation naturally increa&s;es the circulating ca&s;h of the States,</HI> and every one knows what <HI>a &s;pring, what vigor</HI> this gives to every kind of bu&s;ine&s;s in the country, whether of hu&s;bandry, mechanic arts, or trade. There is no compari&s;on between the advantages of carrying on any &s;ort of bu&s;ine&s;s in a country where <HI>ca&s;h circulates freely,</HI> and
<PB N="236" REF="023972_0243_0FC2AEF365AE8F88">
in a country where ca&s;h is <HI>&s;carce.</HI> In the one ca&s;e, every kind of bu&s;ine&s;s will <HI>flouri&s;h,</HI> and indu&s;try has every &s;ort of <HI>encouragement</HI> and motive for exertion; in the other all bu|&s;ine&s;s mu&s;t be &s;adly <HI>embarra&s;&s;ed,</HI> and of cour&s;e make but a feeble and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">low progre&s;s.</P>
<P>We can &s;carce form a conception, what a <HI>different face the&s;e two circum&s;tances will give a country</HI> in a &s;hort time; in the one ca&s;e, <HI>buildings</HI> ri&s;e, <HI>hu&s;bandry</HI> improves, <HI>arts</HI> and <HI>manufactures</HI> flouri&s;h, the country is <HI>alive,</HI> and every part of it <HI>abounding</HI> with indu&s;try, profits, and delight; the other can produce little more than <HI>langui&s;hment, decay, dull|ne&s;s,</HI> and <HI>fruitle&s;s anxiety, di&s;appointment,</HI> and <HI>wretched|ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>VI. The tax I propo&s;e, <HI>will operate in a way of general equality, ju&s;tice, and due proportion.</HI> A tax on general con|&s;umptions cannot fail to bring the burden in <HI>due</HI> propor|tion on individuals, becau&s;e every one will pay in propor|tion to his con&s;umption; and the pre&s;umption is, that the man who &s;pends <HI>mo&s;t,</HI> is <HI>be&s;t able</HI> to &s;pend.</P>
<P>If this propo&s;ition admits of exceptions, they are gene|rally in favor of the <HI>economi&s;t,</HI> the careful, penurious man, and again&s;t the <HI>prodigal</HI> who di&s;&s;ipates his e&s;tate, and will operate as a check upon him, if he is not pa&s;t all con&s;ide|rations of intere&s;t. If this is the ca&s;e with him, the &s;ooner his e&s;tate is run thro' the better it is, both for him&s;elf and the public, for when this happens, he mu&s;t either <HI>die</HI> or <HI>work</HI> for his living, and of cour&s;e do <HI>&s;ome good</HI> in the world, or at lea&s;t <HI>cea&s;e doing hurt;</HI> he will then no longer be able to &s;et an <HI>example</HI> of idlene&s;s, extravagance, and di&s;&s;olutene&s;s, and draw other <HI>gay &s;pirits</HI> into his pernicious practices; and if his con&s;titution &s;hall happen to out-la&s;t his e&s;tate, he may by temperance enjoy &s;ome good degree of health, and his adver&s;ities may perhaps bring on &s;erious reflections, &s;incere repentance, and amendment of life, and if his fortune is de&s;perate in this world, he may at lea&s;t find &s;trong inducements to prepare for the next; &s;o that he is in no &s;en&s;e injured by the tax, but may by pru|dence derive grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> benefits from it.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="023972_0244_0FC2AEF4D1E23770">
Be&s;ides, I am of opinion that government ought to leave every man <HI>ma&s;ter of his own e&s;tate,</HI> and permit him to <HI>judge</HI> for him&s;elf <HI>how fa&s;t</HI> and <HI>in what way</HI> he will &s;pend it; he knows well what tax he pays on every expenditure, and every part of it is &s;ubject to his own <HI>free choice,</HI> and if his career of <HI>di&s;&s;ipation</HI> cannot be <HI>re&s;trained,</HI> it is as <HI>well</HI> for <HI>him,</HI> and much <HI>better</HI> for <HI>the public,</HI> that he &s;hould give part of his wealth to the public trea&s;ury, than wa&s;te the whole of it in his luxury and plea&s;ures; &s;o that I do not &s;ee that he has in this ca&s;e the lea&s;t ground of complaint of <HI>injury</HI> or <HI>oppre&s;&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides, I think there is a kind of <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> in framing the public in&s;tiiutions in &s;uch a manner, that a man cannot &s;pend a dollar in <HI>luxury</HI> and <HI>di&s;&s;ipation,</HI> which is <HI>hurtful</HI> to the public, but he mu&s;t at the &s;ame time <HI>pay another dollar</HI> into the public trea&s;ury, to make thereby &s;ome <HI>compen&s;ation</HI> for the injury which the public receives from his <HI>luxury.</HI></P>
<P>And as to the <HI>niggard, the penurious man,</HI> who does not &s;pend his money in proportion to his <HI>wealth,</HI> and of cour&s;e does not pay <HI>his &s;hare</HI> of tax; it is ob&s;ervable that even his very <HI>penury</HI> inures to the <HI>benefit</HI> of the community, for what he does <HI>not &s;pend,</HI> he <HI>&s;aves,</HI> and thereby enriches him|&s;elf, and of cour&s;e adds to the <HI>wealth</HI> of the community, for the <HI>wealth of the community</HI> is always the <HI>aggregate of the wealth</HI> of every individual who compo&s;es it; this ought therefore to be a <HI>favored ca&s;e,</HI> as the community eventually gains more by a &s;hilling <HI>&s;aved,</HI> than it could by a &s;hilling con&s;umed and <HI>lo&s;t,</HI> tho' the con&s;umer &s;hould pay <HI>&s;ix-pence</HI> into the public trea&s;ury.</P>
<P>In fine, the <HI>tax</HI> on this principle <HI>is carved out of the ex|penditures of the nation,</HI> not indeed <HI>all</HI> expenditures indi&s;cri|minately, but is &s;o calculated as to fall <HI>heavie&s;t</HI> on tho&s;e ex|penditures which are the mo&s;t general <HI>indices of wealth,</HI> and are u&s;ually made by the <HI>rich</HI> who are the be&s;t able to bear them; and the few exceptions which may be &s;uppo&s;ed to take place, will generally operate <HI>in favor of virtue</HI> and <HI>economy,</HI> and again&s;t <HI>vice</HI> and <HI>di&s;&s;ipation;</HI> and where it falls heavie&s;t, and becomes mo&s;t burden&s;ome, it is de&s;igned, and does actually tend, to <HI>correct</HI> that very <HI>vicious ta&s;te</HI> and cor|rupt
<PB N="238" REF="023972_0245_0FC2AEF620B1A8D0">
<HI>habit,</HI> which is the <HI>true cau&s;e</HI> of the burden, and which it is always <HI>in the power</HI> of the &s;ufferer to <HI>ea&s;e</HI> him&s;elf of, whenever he plea&s;es.</P>
<P>Point out any other mode of taxing, if you can, that <HI>finds its way</HI> &s;o &s;urely to the <HI>wealth</HI> of individuals, and <HI>ap|portions</HI> it&s;elf thereto &s;o <HI>equitably,</HI> that no &s;ubject can be burdened beyond his due proportion, without having <HI>a full remedy always in his own power;</HI> yea, a <HI>&s;ure, ea&s;y, and ex|cellent remedy,</HI> becau&s;e a man may always avail him&s;elf of it, without the expen&s;e and trouble of a <HI>law-&s;uit,</HI> or being &s;ubjected to <HI>any body's deci&s;ions, opinions, or caprices,</HI> but his own.</P>
<P>VII. This mode of taxing will make <HI>the quantity and time of the tax depend on the free choice of the man who pays it.</HI> If a man has a mind to drink a bowl of punch or bottle of wine with his friend, or buy a &s;ilk gown for his daughter, he knows very well how much <HI>tax</HI> is <HI>incorporated</HI> with the purcha&s;e, and adopts and pays it with cheerfulne&s;s and good-humor; a <HI>humor</HI> very different from the <HI>irritated &s;en&s;ibility</HI> of a man, who &s;ees an <HI>awful collector</HI> enter upon him with his warrant of <HI>plenary powers</HI> to <HI>di&s;train</HI> his goods, or <HI>arre&s;t</HI> his per&s;on, for a <HI>tax</HI> which perhaps he <HI>abhors,</HI> either from religious &s;cruples, or an opinion that he is rated beyond his due proportion, or becau&s;e he is not at that time <HI>in condition</HI> to pay it.</P>
<P>The good-humor of the &s;ubject is of great con&s;equence in any government. When people have their <HI>own way</HI> and <HI>choice</HI> in a matter, they will bear <HI>great</HI> burdens with <HI>little</HI> complaint; but when matters are forced on them <HI>contrary to their humor,</HI> they will make <HI>great</HI> complaints on <HI>&s;mall</HI> occa&s;ions, and the public peace is often de&s;troyed, much more by the <HI>manner of doing,</HI> than by <HI>the thing done.</HI></P>
<P>VIII. This mode of taxing <HI>will give our trea&s;ury &s;ome compen&s;ation for the monies which our people pay towards the tax of other countries which they travel thro', or re&s;ide in, when abroad.</HI> An <HI>American</HI> cannot travel thro' any country of <HI>Europe,</HI> and drink a bowl of punch or eat a dinner, but he <HI>contributes to the tax</HI> of the country; and if our taxes, like theirs, were laid on &s;uch <HI>luxurious con&s;umptions</HI> as
<PB N="239" REF="023972_0246_0FC2AEF859873F70">
<HI>travellers</HI> u&s;ually indulge them&s;elves in, <HI>their</HI> people who travel thro' <HI>our</HI> country, or re&s;ide in it, would contribute towards <HI>our</HI> taxes, in like manner as <HI>our</HI> people who tra|vel or re&s;ide in <HI>their</HI> countries, contribute to <HI>theirs.</HI></P>
<P>And as we expect that the intercour&s;e between us and all the countries of <HI>Europe</HI> will be very great, it is highly rea&s;onable that <HI>our trea&s;ury</HI> &s;hould receive the <HI>&s;ame benefit</HI> from <HI>their</HI> travellers among us, that <HI>their</HI> trea&s;uries receive from <HI>our</HI> people who travel or re&s;ide among <HI>them,</HI> and a little attention to the &s;ubject will be &s;ufficient to convince any man that this article <HI>is more than a trifle.</HI></P>
<P>IX. This mode of taxing, which brings the burden of the tax principally on articles of luxury, or at mo&s;t on ar|ticles of not the fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ity, <HI>gives ea&s;ement and relief to our hu&s;bandry and manufactures, which are in danger of ruin from the pre&s;ent weight of taxes which lies on them.</HI> If we tax land, we <HI>le&s;&s;en its value,</HI> and of cour&s;e dimini&s;h the whole <HI>farming intere&s;t.</HI> If we tax <HI>polls,</HI> we in effect tax <HI>labor,</HI> which di&s;courages it, and of con&s;equence we ca&s;t a damp and deadening languor on the very <HI>fir&s;t &s;prings,</HI> the <HI>original principle</HI> and <HI>&s;ource</HI> of our national wealth, and <HI>wound</HI> the great &s;taples of the country <HI>in their embryo.</HI></P>
<P>Now I think that any mode of taxing, which gives <HI>re|medy and relief</HI> again&s;t &s;o <HI>great,</HI> &s;o <HI>fatal an evil,</HI> would de|&s;erve con&s;ideration, even tho' it had not the&s;e advantages in its favor, which I have before enumerated. I have heard a &s;tupid and cruel argument urged, that taxing labor has this advantage, that it promotes indu&s;try, becau&s;e it in|crea&s;es nece&s;&s;ity. This argument proves in a very cogent manner, that it is be&s;t to make every body poor, becau&s;e it will make them work the harder.</P>
<P>But I &s;hould think it would be more humane and liberal in a government to manage the public admini&s;tration &s;o, that <HI>indu&s;try</HI> might have all po&s;&s;ible <HI>encouragement,</HI> that it might be rather <HI>animated</HI> by an increa&s;e of happine&s;s and hope of reward, than <HI>goaded on</HI> by dire nece&s;&s;ity and the dreadful &s;purs of pinching want.</P>
<P>I freely give it as my clear and decided opinion, that it is the intere&s;t, duty, and be&s;t policy of every government,
<PB N="240" REF="023972_0247_0FC2AEF9226C8FA0">
to give all po&s;&s;ible <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;e, exoneration, and encouragement to that indu&s;try, tho&s;e occupations, and kinds of bu&s;ine&s;s, which mo&s;t <HI>enrich, &s;trengthen,</HI> and <HI>happi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y</HI> a nation, and to lay the <HI>burdens</HI> of government as far as po&s;&s;ible on tho&s;e <HI>fa&s;hions, habits,</HI> and <HI>practices,</HI> which tend to weaken, <HI>impo|veri&s;h,</HI> and <HI>corrupt</HI> the people; and therefore that any mode of taxing which tends to encourage the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> of the&s;e, and di&s;courage the <HI>la&s;t,</HI> is worthy of the mo&s;t &s;erious at|tention.</P>
<P>But perhaps the advantage of this kind of taxation will appear in a more &s;triking light, by con&s;idering its <HI>practical</HI> and <HI>general effects</HI> on a nation which adopts it; in which view of the matter I think it will be very manife&s;t,</P>
<P>I. That any man of bu&s;ine&s;s, whether he be merchant, farmer, or trade&s;man, <HI>may live ea&s;ier and better, i. e. be happier thro' the year, and richer at the end of it, in a country where this tax is paid,</HI> than he could live in the &s;ame coun|try, <HI>if the tax was not paid;</HI> for as the tax is laid on <HI>u&s;ele&s;s con&s;umptions,</HI> it would of cour&s;e <HI>dimini&s;h</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ho&s;e con&s;ump|tions, and of cour&s;e <HI>&s;ave the fir&s;t co&s;t</HI> of the part dimini&s;h|ed, and all the <HI>additional expen&s;e</HI> which the u&s;e of that part would require.</P>
<P>If a man lives in a country abounding in luxury, he mu&s;t <HI>go</HI> in &s;ome degree <HI>into it,</HI> or appear <HI>&s;ingular</HI> and <HI>mean,</HI> and that part which he would be in a manner compelled to adopt, would probably co&s;t him <HI>more</HI> than his <HI>tax.</HI></P>
<P>But it is here to be con&s;idered, that the <HI>fir&s;t co&s;t</HI> of an article of luxury is not near <HI>all the co&s;t of it.</HI> One article often makes another nece&s;&s;ary, and that a third, and &s;o on almo&s;t <HI>ad infinitum;</HI> if you buy a &s;ilk cloak, there mu&s;t al&s;o be <HI>trimmings,</HI> and that will not do without a <HI>hat</HI> or <HI>bonnet,</HI> and the&s;e require a <HI>&s;uitable accommodation</HI> in every other part of the dre&s;s, in order to keep up any &s;ort of <HI>decency and uniformity</HI> of appearance; and there al&s;o mu&s;t be &s;pent a great deal of time to put the&s;e <HI>fine things on,</HI> and to <HI>wear</HI> them, to <HI>&s;how</HI> them, to <HI>receive</HI> and <HI>pay</HI> vi&s;its in them, &amp;c.</P>
<P>And when this kind of luxury prevails in a country be|yond the degree which its <HI>wealth can bear,</HI> the con&s;equence

is <HI>pride, poverty, debt, duns, law-&s;uits,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. The far|mer finds the proceeds of the year <HI>vani&s;hed into trifles;</HI> the merchant and trade&s;man may &s;ell their goods indeed, but cannot <HI>get payment</HI> for them.

<P>But were the&s;e families, with the &s;ame income, to live in a country of <HI>more economy</HI> and <HI>le&s;s luxury,</HI> they would ea&s;ily pay the taxes on the luxuries they did u&s;e, keep on a <HI>good footing</HI> with their neighbours, appear with as <HI>much di&s;tinction,</HI> live <HI>happy</HI> and <HI>unembarra&s;&s;ed thro'</HI> the year, and have money in their pockets at the <HI>end</HI> of it.

will &s;uppo&s;e then that all this is done, and when this is done, we will &s;top a moment, and look round us, and view the <HI>advantages</HI> re&s;ulting from this mea&s;ure, over and above the capital one of checking and re&s;training that ex|ce&s;&s;ive luxury that threatens, if not an <HI>ab&s;olute de&s;truction,</HI> yet at lea&s;t a <HI>tarni&s;hment of every principle</HI> out of which our pro&s;perity, wealth, and happine&s;s mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily and for ever flow.

<P>The fir&s;t grand effect which pre&s;ents it&s;elf to my view is, that <HI>our army will be paid;</HI> and that our brethren, our fellow-citizens, who, by their <HI>valor,</HI> their <HI>patience,</HI> their <HI>per&s;everance</HI> in the field, have &s;ecured to us our <HI>va&s;t, exten|&s;ive country,</HI> and all its ble&s;&s;ings, will be enabled to <HI>return</HI> to their friends and connexions, not only <HI>crowned</HI> with the <HI>laurels</HI> of the field, but <HI>rewarded</HI> by the <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>grati|tude</HI> of their country, and be thereby enabled to &s;upport their <HI>dignity of character,</HI> or at lea&s;t be put on <HI>a footing with their fellow-citizens</HI> (whom they have &s;aved) in the procurement of the means of living.</P>
<P>The next advantage of this mea&s;ure which occurs to me is, <HI>the ea&s;ement and exoneration of the laborers of the commu|nity, the hu&s;bandman and trade&s;man,</HI> out of <HI>who&s;e labor</HI> all our <HI>wealth</HI> and <HI>&s;upplies</HI> are derived; by them we are <HI>fed,</HI> by them we are <HI>clothed,</HI> by the various modifications of <HI>their labor</HI> our <HI>&s;taples</HI> are produced, our <HI>commerce</HI> receives its principle, and our utmo&s;t <HI>abundance</HI> is &s;upplied; we are therefore bound by every principle of <HI>ju&s;tice, gratitude,</HI> and <HI>good policy,</HI> to give them encouragement and uninterrupted &s;ecurity in their peaceful occupations, and not, by an <HI>un|natural</HI> and <HI>ill-fated</HI> arrangement of our finances, compel them to <HI>leave</HI> their <HI>labors,</HI> which are the grand object of <HI>their</HI> attention and <HI>our</HI> &s;upplies, <HI>to go and hunt up money</HI> to &s;atisfy a collector of taxes.</P>

<P>On this &s;tate of the matter I beg leave to ob&s;erve, that the war it&s;elf for &s;even years pa&s;t has laid a tax on us near|ly <HI>equal to the highe&s;t of the&s;e,</HI> and on &s;ome articles of ne|ce&s;&s;ary con&s;umption, from <HI>two hundred</HI> to a <HI>thou&s;and</HI> per cent. <HI>higher,</HI> &s;uch as <HI>&s;alt, pepper, all&s;pice, allum, powder, lead,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. and yet I never heard any body complain of being ruined by the war, becau&s;e <HI>rum</HI> was <HI>twenty &s;hillings</HI> per gallon, <HI>tea</HI> twelve &s;hillings per pound, or <HI>mantuas</HI> three dollars a yard, or <HI>pepper</HI> ten &s;hillings a pound, or <HI>&s;uperfine cloths</HI> eight dollars a yard, &amp;c. Nor does it appear to me, that the country has paid <HI>a &s;hilling more</HI> for <HI>rum, &s;ilks, &s;uperfine cloths,</HI> &amp;c. for the <HI>la&s;t &s;even years,</HI> than was paid for the &s;ame articles the &s;even <HI>preceding years, i. e.</HI> the whole tax was paid by <HI>le&s;&s;ening the con&s;umption</HI> of the&s;e articles.</P>
<P>Nor do I think that the health, habits, or happine&s;s of the country have &s;uffered in the lea&s;t on the whole, from its being obliged to u&s;e <HI>le&s;s of the&s;e articles</HI> than was before u&s;ual; but be this as it may, it is very certain that the country has &s;uffered but little from the increa&s;ed price of the&s;e articles which I propo&s;e to tax, except at &s;ome par|ticular times when tho&s;e prices were rai&s;ed much higher than the point to which I propo&s;e to rai&s;e them, <HI>i. e.</HI> at particular times <HI>rum</HI> has been as high as <HI>three dollars</HI> a gal|lon; <HI>tea, three dollars</HI> a pound; <HI>&s;ugars, three &s;hillings</HI> and <HI>&s;ix-pence,</HI> and <HI>coffee, three &s;hillings and &s;ix-pence</HI> a pound; <HI>mantuas</HI> four dollars a yard, &amp;c.</P>
<P>But it is ob&s;ervable, that the principal increa&s;ed prices which have really hurt and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed the country during the war, have been of <HI>other articles</HI> which I propo&s;e to tax very lightly, or not at all; &s;uch as <HI>&s;alt,</HI> which has at times

<P>The u&s;e I mean to make of the&s;e ob&s;ervations is, to prove from plain, acknowledged fact, that the <HI>increa&s;ed price</HI> of the articles which I wi&s;h to tax, up to the utmo&s;t point to which I propo&s;e to rai&s;e them, will be but a <HI>light inconvenience</HI> (if any at all) on the people, and the <HI>dimini&s;h|ed</HI> con&s;umption of tho&s;e articles, and the <HI>increa&s;e</HI> of <HI>circu|lating ca&s;h</HI> (both which will naturally and unavoidably re|&s;ult from the tax) will be <HI>benefits</HI> which will at lea&s;t com|pen&s;ate for the <HI>burden</HI> of the tax, and I think it is very plain, will leave a <HI>balance of advantage</HI> in favor of the tax.</P>
<P>But if you &s;hould think I conclude too &s;trongly, and you &s;hould not be able to go quite my lengths in this ar|gument, &s;o much, I think, does at lea&s;t appear inconte&s;ta|bly plain, that if there is a <HI>real di&s;advantage</HI> ari&s;ing from my mode of taxing, it is <HI>&s;o &s;mall,</HI> that it holds <HI>no compa|ri&s;on</HI> with the burden of tax <HI>hitherto in u&s;e</HI> on polls and e&s;tates, which <HI>di&s;courages indu&s;try, oppre&s;&s;es the laborer, le&s;|&s;ens</HI> the value of our <HI>lands, ruins</HI> our <HI>hu&s;bandry</HI> and <HI>manu|factures,</HI> and with all the&s;e dreary evils, cannot po&s;&s;ibly be collected to <HI>half the amount</HI> which <HI>the public &s;ervice requires.</HI></P>
<P>But to &s;ave further argument on this head, I will with great a&s;&s;urance appeal to the &s;en&s;e, the feelings of our <HI>farmers,</HI> who make the great bulk of our inhabitants, if they would not <HI>prefer living</HI> in a <HI>country</HI> where they mu&s;t pay the afore-mentioned <HI>increa&s;ed prices</HI> on the goods I pro|po&s;e to tax, rather than <HI>where</HI> they mu&s;t part with the &s;ame number of <HI>cows, oxen, &s;heep, bu&s;hels of wheat,</HI> or <HI>pounds of pork</HI> or <HI>beef,</HI> &amp;c. which are now, in the pre&s;ent mode of taxing, annually demanded of them to &s;atisfy the tax.</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="023972_0254_0FC2AF3E447D8D28">
I dare make the &s;ame appeal to all our <HI>trade&s;men,</HI> and even to our <HI>merchants,</HI> who, in my opinion, would have clear and decided advantages from my mode of taxing, as well as the farmers. I do not &s;ee how the merchant or any body el&s;e can be hurt by the tax; but will all be clear|ly benefited by it, if the following particulars are ob|&s;erved:</P>
<P>I. That <HI>the tax be laid with &s;uch judgment and prudence, and different weight on different articles, that the con&s;umption of no article &s;hall be dimini&s;hed by it, beyond what the good and true intere&s;t of the nation requires;</HI> for it is certainly <HI>better for the merchant</HI> to deal with his cu&s;tomers in &s;uch articles as are <HI>u&s;eful</HI> to them, and in &s;uch way that they &s;hall de|rive, <HI>real benefit from their trade with him,</HI> than to &s;upply them with articles that are <HI>u&s;ele&s;s</HI> or <HI>hurtful</HI> to them, and which of cour&s;e impoveri&s;h them.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t ca&s;e, he will make his cu&s;tomers <HI>rich</HI> and <HI>able to continue</HI> trading with him, and to make him good and punctual <HI>payments:</HI> in the other ca&s;e, he makes his cu&s;tomers <HI>poor,</HI> and of cour&s;e &s;ubjects him&s;elf to the dan|ger of <HI>dilatory payments,</HI> or perhaps of a <HI>final lo&s;s</HI> of his debts.</P>
<P>II. That <HI>the tax be univer&s;al and alike on every part of the country,</HI> for if one State is taxed, and its neighbour is not, the State taxed will lo&s;e its trade. This proves in the mo&s;t intuitive manner, that every tax of impo&s;t on imported goods mu&s;t be laid by the <HI>general government,</HI> and not by any <HI>particular State,</HI> who&s;e laws cannot be extended be|yond its own juri&s;diction.

<P>III. <HI>That the tax be univer&s;ally collected. Smuggling</HI> hurts the <HI>fair trader;</HI> favor and connivance of collectors to par|ticular importers, thro' <HI>bribery, friend&s;hip,</HI> or <HI>indolence,</HI> has the &s;ame effect; the per&s;on who <HI>avoids</HI> the tax can <HI>under|&s;ell</HI> him who <HI>pays</HI> it; therefore it is the <HI>great intere&s;t of the merchant,</HI> when the duty is laid, to make it a <HI>decided point,</HI> that <HI>every</HI> importer &s;hall <HI>pay the duty.</HI></P>
<P>And I am of opinion, that when the <HI>body of merchants</HI> make it a <HI>decided</HI> matter to carry any point of this nature, they are very <HI>able</HI> to accompli&s;h it; they certainly <HI>know bet|ter</HI>

<P>I conceive nothing more is nece&s;&s;ary to make the collec|tion of this tax ea&s;y, than to convince the <HI>merchants,</HI> and indeed the whole <HI>community,</HI> that the tax is <HI>nece&s;&s;ary for the public &s;ervice,</HI>&mdash;for the e&s;&s;ential <HI>purpo&s;es</HI> of government; and that every one who pays it, receives a full compen&s;a|tion in the <HI>benefits</HI> he derives from the union; and that the <HI>management of the affair</HI> be committed to the <HI>merchants,</HI> to which, from the nature of their profe&s;&s;ion and bu&s;ine&s;s, they are <HI>more adequate and qualified,</HI> than any <HI>other</HI> men; and as it falls directly within the &s;phere of their bu&s;ine&s;s, it &s;eems to be an <HI>honor,</HI> a <HI>mark of confidence,</HI> to which they are entitled.</P>
<P>Indeed, let the community at large be <HI>convinced</HI> that the money proceeding from this tax, is <HI>nece&s;&s;ary for the public &s;ervice,</HI> and that it can be a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with <HI>le&s;s burden</HI> on the people <HI>in this way,</HI> than in the <HI>mode hitherto practi&s;ed,</HI> and the collection will be <HI>ea&s;y and natural.</HI></P>
<P>The tax will cea&s;e to be con&s;idered, like the taxes form|erly impo&s;ed on us by the <HI>Briti&s;h Parliament, uncon&s;titution|al</HI> in their <HI>a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment,</HI> and <HI>u&s;ele&s;s</HI> in their <HI>expenditure,</HI> for they plagued us with taxes only to &s;atisfy their harpies (little or none of the money ever reached the <HI>Briti&s;h trea&s;ury</HI>) but <HI>this tax</HI> is impo&s;ed by our own people,&mdash;by our own repre&s;entatives, and for our own benefit.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be impo&s;ed by Congre&s;s indeed, as the autho|rity of any particular A&s;&s;embly cannot be adequate to it; for it mu&s;t operate alike in all the States, be alike univer|&s;al in its effects, and uniform in its mode of a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment and collection; and mu&s;t therefore proceed from the <HI>gene|ral</HI> authority which pre&s;ides over the whole Union, <HI>i. e.</HI> from the Congre&s;s; but it is a Congre&s;s of our <HI>own ap|pointment:</HI> for the members of Congre&s;s are as much <HI>our repre&s;entatives,</HI> and cho&s;en by <HI>our people,</HI> as the members of the &s;everal <HI>State-A&s;&s;emblies;</HI> and the end and u&s;e of the tax is <HI>our own public &s;ervice,</HI> to &s;ecure the benefits of <HI>our</HI> union, without which it is impo&s;&s;ible we &s;hould obtain <HI>re|&s;pectability abroad,</HI> an <HI>uniform admini&s;tration</HI> of civil po|lice

<P>I never knew any mea&s;ure of government oppo&s;ed in its execution by the people, when a general conviction took place that the mea&s;ure was properly planned, and was ne|ce&s;&s;ary to the public good. We have had full proof thro' the war, what <HI>great burdens</HI> our people will, very cheer|fully and even without complaint, bear, when they are <HI>convinced</HI> that the <HI>exigencies</HI> of the State, and the <HI>public &s;afe|ty,</HI> made <HI>them nece&s;&s;ary.</HI></P>
<P>This exhibits <HI>the tax in an advantageous light,</HI> rather <HI>eli|gible</HI> than <HI>&s;hocking,</HI> connects the ideas of <HI>burden</HI> and <HI>benefit</HI> together, and naturally brings the <HI>evils</HI> removed by the tax, and the <HI>advantages</HI> re&s;ulting from it, into one view, and may &s;trike the minds of the people &s;o &s;trongly, as to make the <HI>burden</HI> of it appear light, when compared with its <HI>be|nefits.</HI></P>
<P>This brings me to the con&s;ideration of the <HI>practicability of my mode of taxation</HI> which I propo&s;ed, and which I do conceive is a matter of capital weight in this di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, for which I do rely on the&s;e two grand propo&s;itions:</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That whatever is the real, great intere&s;t of the people, they may, by proper mea&s;ures, be made to believe and adopt:</HI> and,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That whatever is admitted to be a matter of common and important intere&s;t, in the general opinion of the people, may be ea&s;ily put in practice by wi&s;dom, prudence, and due manage|ment of the affair.</HI></P>
<P>I do contend, that when this tax is fairly propo&s;ed to the public, with a proper elucidation of the <HI>evils</HI> it avoids, and the <HI>advantages</HI> which re&s;ult from it, it will not be looked on as a <HI>burden of oppre&s;&s;ion,</HI> an <HI>impo&s;ition of power,</HI> but as the <HI>purcha&s;e</HI> of our mo&s;t <HI>precious ble&s;&s;ings,</HI> as a mea&s;ure ab|&s;olutely <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> to our mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential and important <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|tere&s;ts.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore any attempt to <HI>avoid</HI> this tax, by <HI>&s;muggling</HI> or any <HI>other way,</HI> will be deemed by general con&s;ent an act of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">eanne&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">;</HI> an <HI>avoidance</HI> of a <HI>due</HI> &s;hare of the public burden; fru&s;trating the <HI>nece&s;&s;ary plans</HI> of public &s;afety, and render|ing

ineffectual the <HI>public mea&s;ures</HI> adopted by general con|&s;ent, for the public &s;ecurity, tranquillity, and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Such an action implies in it great <HI>meanne&s;s</HI> of character in the agent, and a <HI>high crime</HI> again&s;t the State, and the detection of it will be con&s;idered as a very material <HI>&s;ervice</HI> to the Commonwealth. Where any actions are deemed <HI>crimes, &s;candals,</HI> and <HI>nui&s;ances</HI> by the general voice of the people, <HI>detections and informations</HI> again&s;t them are reputa|ble; they cea&s;e to be <HI>infamous&mdash;the infamy of an informer</HI> does not take place in &s;uch in&s;tances.</P>
<P><HI>The rea&s;ons of governmental mea&s;ures ought always to attend their publication,</HI> &s;o far as to afford good means of convic|tion to the people at large, that their <HI>object and tendency</HI> is the <HI>public good.</HI> This greatly facilitates their execution and &s;ucce&s;s.

<P>I abhor a <HI>my&s;terious government.</HI> I think an admini&s;tra|tion, like a private man, which affects to have a great <HI>ma|ny &s;ecrets</HI> that mu&s;t not be explained, has generally a great many <HI>faults</HI> which will not bear <HI>telling,</HI> or a great deal of <HI>corruption</HI> which will not bear <HI>examining.</HI> Government, like private per&s;ons, may indeed have <HI>&s;ecrets,</HI> which ought to be kept &s;o; but in that ca&s;e, caution &s;hould be u&s;ed again&s;t any intimations or hints getting abroad, even <HI>that there are &s;uch &s;ecrets,</HI> or any &s;ecrets: for this would pro|duce an anxious inquiry and &s;olicitous in&s;pection, which might make the <HI>keeping</HI> the &s;ecret more <HI>difficult,</HI> and be&s;ides bring on many other inconveniencies ari&s;ing from number|le&s;s apprehen&s;ions, which &s;uch a circum&s;tance would give birth to.</P>
<P>An <HI>o&s;tentatious giving out</HI> that there are <HI>mighty &s;ecrets</HI> in the cabinet, or many <HI>my&s;teries</HI> in the State, that mu&s;t not be <HI>pried</HI> too clo&s;ely <HI>into,</HI> is the very contrary of all this, and generally is a &s;ign of a <HI>weak admini&s;tration,</HI> and not &s;eldom of a <HI>corrupt</HI> one; but of all public mea&s;ures which require explanations to the people, <HI>that of taxes,</HI> which touches

<P N="1">1. <HI>That the money required in taxes is nece&s;&s;ary for the pub|lic good:</HI> and,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That it will certainly be actually expended only on the ob|jects for which it is a&s;ked and given.</HI></P>
<P>And if the&s;e two things are <HI>really true,</HI> there will rarely be much difficulty in making them to be <HI>believed</HI> thro' the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible part of the Commonwealth; but if the&s;e two things either a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> not <HI>really true</HI> or not <HI>really and generally believed,</HI> I do not know that a <HI>&s;tanding army</HI> would be &s;uf|ficient to collect the taxes.</P>
<P>I am of opinion their force, authority, and influence, like the conque&s;ts of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> army, would la&s;t no longer in any place than they &s;taid to &s;upport it. Whenever they &s;hall go away, I imagine they will find that they have left behind them infinitely more <HI>abhorrence</HI> than <HI>obedience</HI> among the people.</P>
<P>Tho' I am clearly of opinion that there mu&s;t exi&s;t <HI>an ul|timate force</HI> or <HI>power of compul&s;ion</HI> in every effective and good government, yet it is plain to me, that &s;uch force is never to be put in action <HI>again&s;t the general conviction</HI> or <HI>opi|nion</HI> of the people; nor indeed do I believe it ever <HI>can</HI> be &s;o exerci&s;ed with &s;ucce&s;s and final effect, for every attempt of this kind tends to <HI>convul&s;ions and death.</HI></P>
<P>Such an ultimate force indeed ought to fall upon and correct tho&s;e who &s;in again&s;t the peace, intere&s;t, and &s;ecu|rity of the public.

<P>In all ca&s;es of this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ort, the <HI>righteous &s;everities</HI> of govern|ment will be <HI>approved, &s;upported,</HI> and even <HI>applauded</HI> by the general voice.</P>
<P>Yea, if we were to &s;uppo&s;e that the general opinion was wrong in any particular matter of importance, yet it is plain, that vicious opinion could not be <HI>controlled by force;</HI> it mu&s;t continue till the ill effects of it &s;hall produce a <HI>ge|neral conviction</HI> of its error, or till the people can be con|vinced by rea&s;on and argument of the danger of &s;uch opi|nion, before the ill con&s;equences of it are <HI>actually</HI> felt; in both which ca&s;es the people will <HI>turn about fa&s;t enough of their own accord,</HI> and the <HI>error</HI> will be <HI>corrected</HI> mo&s;t effec|tually, and with ea&s;e, and without any danger of di&s;turb|ing the public tranquillity.</P>
<P>Opinions indeed of a dangerous, hurtful nature may &s;pread among the people, and, when they become general, are to be con&s;idered as great public calamities, which ad|mit of no remedy but that which they carry with them, and which will prove effectual in the end, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> their <HI>own evil tendency,</HI> and therefore mu&s;t be <HI>let alone,</HI> like inundati|ons, which, however calamitous, whatever wa&s;te and de|&s;truction they make, cannot be controlled; any attempt to <HI>&s;top</HI> their force, <HI>increa&s;es</HI> their violence and mi&s;chief; they do <HI>lea&s;t hurt</HI> when they are <HI>unmole&s;ted,</HI> and are &s;uffered to drain them&s;elves off in their own natural channels.</P>

every plan of this kind as a departure from the true principles of government, as de&s;tructive in its con&s;equen|ces, as ab&s;urd and ineffectual to its own ends; for &s;uch a government, whenever it has been tried, in&s;tead of promot|ing the <HI>peace, &s;ecurity,</HI> and <HI>happine&s;s</HI> of the State, has ge|nerally been found to have operated by way of <HI>tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>It appears from all this, that the true art of government lies in <HI>good and full information of the facts</HI> to which its or|dinances are to be accommodated, and <HI>in wi&s;dom in adopt|ing &s;uch in&s;titutions, laws, and plans of operation,</HI> as &s;hall be&s;t &s;uit the &s;tate and true intere&s;ts of the people; and <HI>acting openly, fairly, and candidly with them.</HI> You may as well at|tempt, by fine&s;&s;es, to cheat people into <HI>holine&s;s</HI> and <HI>heaven,</HI> as into their <HI>real political intere&s;ts.</HI></P>
<P>There are people &s;cattered over the whole nation, who under&s;tand the great intere&s;ts of the community and the wi&s;dom of public mea&s;ures, and are as firmly attached to them as tho&s;e who &s;it in the &s;eat of government, and who are always di&s;&s;atisfied, and their confidence in the public coun&s;els is le&s;&s;ened, when they ob&s;erve public mea&s;ures are adopted, which they do not &s;ee the <HI>u&s;e of,</HI> and the <HI>ends</HI> for which they are calculated; and of cour&s;e <HI>little my&s;tery</HI> and <HI>few &s;ecrets</HI> are nece&s;&s;ary in government.

<P>In &s;uch a mode of admini&s;tration as this, if burdens that are <HI>really heavy</HI> are <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> for the public &s;afety, they will be <HI>cheerfully</HI> taken up, and <HI>patiently borne,</HI> by the peo|ple without endangering the public tranquillity.</P>
<P>Another objection again&s;t my mode of taxing (which, in my opinion, is the greate&s;t by far that can be fairly urged) remains yet to be con&s;idered. I once almo&s;t concluded not to mention it here, becau&s;e its hurtful operation is <HI>di&s;tant,</HI> we are in no <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> danger of its effects, and its <HI>evils may be prevented</HI> or <HI>remedied</HI> in future time by nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ures, without requiring our pre&s;ent attention.

utmo&s;t inve&s;tigation of it has been able to di&s;cover, that the public may take it up or reject it on the fulle&s;t rea&s;on that I can lay before them. The objection is,</P>
<P><HI>That this tax is in&s;en&s;ible, and will produce more money than the people are apprized of, and in future time, when our trade and con&s;umptions &s;hall increa&s;e, may produce more than the public &s;ervice will require,</HI> and of cour&s;e <HI>will tend to public di&s;&s;ipation and corruption.</HI> For <HI>frugality</HI> in a <HI>court</HI> ever &s;prings from <HI>nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> and a <HI>rich trea&s;ury naturally makes a prodigal admini&s;tration,</HI> and too often a <HI>corrupt one.</HI></P>
<P>It may be an&s;wered, that it will always be ea&s;y to <HI>le&s;&s;en or take the tax off,</HI> whenever it &s;hall become <HI>too productive.</HI> This may be <HI>ea&s;y,</HI> but will always be <HI>dangerous.</HI> The im|po&s;ing it at the clo&s;e of the war will prevent the <HI>fall of the goods taxed,</HI> and keep them <HI>up partly to the war pri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e,</HI> and of cour&s;e <HI>&s;ave the merchants</HI> who have goods by them, from <HI>very great lo&s;s,</HI> and is a good rea&s;on for impo&s;ing it now; but when it &s;hall be taken off, it will <HI>reduce</HI> the price of the goods taxed, in &s;o <HI>&s;udden a manner,</HI> as will be very <HI>hurtful</HI> to tho&s;e who have &s;tock on hand, and may ruin ve|ry many families.</P>
<P>There is another, and perhaps better, way of guarding again&s;t the evils of the objection. It will be ea&s;y to tran&s;|mit to each State an account of the annual proceeds of the tax, and when the <HI>amount</HI> &s;hall exceed the <HI>annual expendi|tures,</HI> an <HI>account of the &s;urplus,</HI> together with an e&s;timate of the proportion of each State (according to the e&s;tabli&s;h|ed quota of burdens and benefits) may be returned with it, and the &s;aid <HI>proportion of the &s;urplus</HI> may be made <HI>&s;ubject to the orders of each State re&s;pectively;</HI> and if they judge that they can <HI>more &s;afely tru&s;t their own economy,</HI> than that of the <HI>&s;upreme admini&s;tration,</HI> each State may draw its quo|ta out of the <HI>general trea&s;ury</HI> into <HI>its own,</HI> and there keep it as a depo&s;ited fund of public wealth, or di&s;po&s;e of it as they plea&s;e.

I have known this cogent argument u&s;ed in favor of fo|reign loans, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> we give but <HI>five per cent.</HI> intere&s;t <HI>abroad,</HI> and our people can make <HI>ten per cent. advantage</HI> of the mo|ney <HI>at home,</HI> therefore they gain five per cent. by the loan.</P>
<P>This &s;tupid argument, if it proves any thing, ju&s;t proves that it is every man's intere&s;t to borrow money, for it is certainly profitable to buy any thing for five pounds which will bring ten; but the natural fact is the very rever&s;e of this, for if you bring money into a kingdom or family, which is not the <HI>proceeds of indu&s;try,</HI> it will naturally <HI>le&s;&s;en the indu&s;try</HI> and <HI>increa&s;e the expen&s;es of it.</HI> It has been of|ten ob&s;erved, that when a per&s;on gains any <HI>&s;udden acqui&s;i|tion of wealth</HI> by trea&s;ure-trove, captures at &s;ea, drawing a high prize in a lottery, or any other way <HI>not connected with indu&s;try,</HI> he is rarely known to <HI>keep it long,</HI> but &s;oon <HI>di&s;&s;i|pates it.</HI> The <HI>&s;en&s;ible value</HI> of money is lo&s;t, when the idea of it becomes <HI>di&s;connected</HI> with the <HI>labor and pain of earning it,</HI> and expen&s;es will naturally <HI>increa&s;e</HI> where there is <HI>plenty of wealth</HI> to &s;upport them. The effect is the &s;ame on a nation.</P>
<P>Is <HI>Spain</HI> a whit richer for all the mines of <HI>South-Ameri|ca?</HI> The indu&s;try of <HI>Holland</HI> has proved a much &s;urer &s;ource of durable wealth. We already find a dangerous <HI>exce&s;s of luxury</HI> growing out of our <HI>borrowed money,</HI> and our <HI>indu&s;try</HI> (e&s;pecially in procuring &s;upplies of our own) wants <HI>great animation.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the afore&s;aid argument is not grounded on fact; it is true, I &s;uppo&s;e, that we pay but five per cent. intere&s;t on our foreign loans, but they co&s;t us from fifteen to twenty per cent. more to get them home, for that is at lea&s;t the di&s;count which has been made on the &s;ale of our bills for &s;everal years pa&s;t, and if we bring it over in ca&s;h,
<PB N="257" REF="023972_0264_0FC2AFA20C533A48">
there is freight and in&s;urance to be paid, which increa&s;es the lo&s;s.</P>
<P>From this it appears, that for every eighty pounds of &s;upply which we obtain in this way, we mu&s;t pay at lea&s;t an hundred pounds, even if we were to pay the principal at the end of the year, and the con&s;uming worm of five per cent. intere&s;t every year after, if the payment is delay|ed: to all this lo&s;s is to be added, all the expen&s;e of <HI>nego|tiating</HI> the loans abroad, <HI>brokerage</HI> on &s;ale of the bills, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>To e&s;cape the ruinous effects of this mode of &s;upply, I think <HI>every exertion</HI> &s;hould be made to obtain our &s;upplies <HI>at home;</HI> it is certainly very plain our country i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>not ex|hau&s;ted,</HI> it is <HI>full</HI> of every kind of <HI>&s;upply</HI> which we need, and nothing further can be nece&s;&s;ary, than to find <HI>tho&s;e ave|nues from the &s;ources of wealth</HI> in the hands of individuals, which <HI>lead into the public trea&s;ury,</HI> tho&s;e <HI>ways</HI> and <HI>proportions</HI> that are mo&s;t <HI>ju&s;t,</HI> mo&s;t <HI>equal,</HI> and mo&s;t <HI>ea&s;y</HI> to the people. This is the <HI>fir&s;t great art</HI> of finance; that of <HI>economy</HI> in expenditures is the next.</P>
<P>Any body may receive money and pay it out; borrow money and draw bills; but to <HI>rai&s;e and manage the internal revenue,</HI> &s;o as to make the <HI>wealth</HI> of the country <HI>balance</HI> the <HI>public expenditures,</HI> is not &s;o ea&s;y a ta&s;k, but yet I think not &s;o hard as to be impracticable; unle&s;s this can be done, the <HI>greate&s;t conceivable abilities</HI> mu&s;t <HI>labor in vain,</HI> for it is naturally impo&s;&s;ible that any e&s;tate, which cannot pay its expenditures, &s;hould continue long without embarra&s;&s;ment and diminution; the load of debt mu&s;t continually increa&s;e, and the intere&s;t will make a continual addition to that debt, and render the e&s;tate more and more unable every year to clear it&s;elf; but if the e&s;tate <HI>can pay its expenditures,</HI> it is the height of madne&s;s <HI>not to do it.</HI></P>
<P>If revenues can be &s;pared &s;ufficient to di&s;charge the in|tere&s;t of the debt, &s;o as to &s;top its increa&s;e, the e&s;tate may be &s;aved, and a future increa&s;e of revenue may in time wipe off the principal; but no hope is left, if <HI>intere&s;t upon intere&s;t</HI> mu&s;t continue to <HI>accumulate.</HI></P>

And as the <HI>intere&s;t of every individual is in&s;eparably con|nected with the public credit</HI> or &s;tate of the finances, it fol|lows that this affair becomes a matter of the utmo&s;t con|cern and very important moment to <HI>every per&s;on</HI> in the community, and therefore ought to be attended to as a matter of the highe&s;t national concern; and <HI>no burden</HI> ought to be accounted <HI>too heavy,</HI> which is &s;ufficient to <HI>re|medy</HI> &s;o great a mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>It may be objected to all this, that the duties I propo&s;e are &s;o extremely high, that, 1. <HI>they will hurt our trade:</HI> and, 2. <HI>can have no chance of obtaining a general con&s;ent.</HI></P>
<P>To the fir&s;t I an&s;wer&mdash;as far as this tax tends to le&s;&s;en the importation of hurtful luxuries and u&s;ele&s;s con&s;ump|tions, it is <HI>the very object I have in view;</HI> and it is &s;o very <HI>light</HI> on all other articles, that the <HI>burden</HI> will be almo&s;t <HI>in|&s;en&s;ible.</HI></P>
<P>But as to the &s;econd objection&mdash;it is in vain to <HI>trifle</HI> with a matter of &s;uch weight and importance, or weary our peo|ple with <HI>&s;mall plans</HI> and <HI>remedies,</HI> utterly inadequate to the purpo&s;e.

<P>Our national debt, including the &s;upplies for the pre&s;ent year, I am told, by the Financier's e&s;timate delivered to Congre&s;s, amounts to about 35,000,000 <HI>of dollars,</HI> the an|nual intere&s;t of which will be &s;omewhat above 2,000,000 of dollars, which, I think, may be rai&s;ed by the tax I pro|po&s;e (tho' it is impo&s;&s;ible to tell with much preci&s;ion, what the proceeds of a tax will be, which has not been tried:) it is very plain that the proceeds will be large, and &s;o cal|culated as to be almo&s;t wholly a clear &s;aving, not to &s;ay a benefit, to the country; and if there &s;hould be deficiencies, a &s;mall additional tax may be laid in the u&s;ual way to &s;up|ply them.</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="023972_0266_0FC2AFA65A4C1610">
Our annual expenditures, on the peace e&s;tabli&s;hment, may, I think, be reduced to a quarter or third of a million of dollars, and perhaps, if our national debt <HI>was liquidated as it ought to be,</HI> a great &s;aving might be made both of <HI>prin|cipal and intere&s;t;</HI> but the detail of the&s;e matters is in eve|ry one's power, who has lei&s;ure and proper documents to make the calculations.</P>
<P>Without de&s;cending to <HI>minutiae,</HI> I only mean to examine the <HI>great principles</HI> of re&s;ource and <HI>mode</HI> of &s;upply which are within our power, and give my rea&s;ons as clear as I can for adopting a <HI>practical trial.</HI> Such a practice would doubtle&s;s <HI>di&s;cover</HI> many things which no <HI>fore&s;ight</HI> can reach, and <HI>experience only</HI> can elucidate; it is an <HI>untrodden path</HI> which I recommend, and tho' it cannot be perfectly known, yet it &s;eems to me to have &s;uch an <HI>appearance of advantage</HI> as de&s;erves a trial.</P>
<P>The <HI>expen&s;e</HI> and <HI>difficulty</HI> of collection will be <HI>no greater</HI> on the <HI>high tax</HI> I propo&s;e, than it would be on a <HI>trifling one,</HI> which would produce le&s;s than a <HI>tenth part</HI> of the &s;up|ply which this would furni&s;h.</P>
<P>Therefore, if it &s;hould be judged prudent to make the trial, I think it mo&s;t advi&s;able to take it up on <HI>&s;uch a large &s;cale,</HI> as will make it <HI>&s;ufficiently productive</HI> to become an ob|ject worthy of <HI>&s;trong effort</HI> and <HI>per&s;evering diligence,</HI> in or|der to give it <HI>a full effect.</HI></P>
<P>In fine, we have not children or dunces to deal with, but a people who have as quick a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ight of their intere&s;t, and as much courage, readine&s;s, and cheerfulne&s;s to &s;up|port it as any people on earth. We can have, therefore, nothing more to do, than to make &s;uch propo&s;itions to them as are <HI>really</HI> for their intere&s;t, to convince their minds that the thing propo&s;ed is <HI>nece&s;&s;ary and beneficial;</HI> and this is to be done, not by <HI>refinement of argument,</HI> but by devi&s;ing and explaining <HI>&s;uch mea&s;ures</HI> as will, from their <HI>nature and ope|ration,</HI> produce <HI>beneficial effects.</HI></P>
<P>We mu&s;t, with candor and fairne&s;s, in a manner open and undi&s;gui&s;ed, <HI>tell them</HI> what we want money <HI>for,</HI> and <HI>how much,</HI> and by a <HI>wi&s;e and upright management</HI> of their intere&s;ts de&s;erve and gain <HI>their confidence,</HI> that their money,

when obtained, &s;hall, to the <HI>la&s;t &s;hilling,</HI> be paid for &s;uch <HI>nece&s;&s;ary purpo&s;es;</HI> the tax will then cea&s;e to be <HI>odious.</HI> It will become an object of <HI>acknowledged intere&s;t,</HI> and every per&s;on who <HI>&s;muggles</HI> or otherwi&s;e <HI>avoids</HI> the tax, will be con&s;idered as <HI>&s;hrinking from a burden</HI> which the public good makes nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Every attempt of this &s;ort will become <HI>di&s;reputable</HI> and <HI>infamous,</HI> and when you can connect the <HI>tax</HI> and <HI>character</HI> together, there will be <HI>little difficulty</HI> in collecting it.</P>
<P>This will effectually obviate the great objection, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that it will be <HI>impracticable</HI> to collect a heavy tax on goods of <HI>great</HI> value, but <HI>little</HI> bulk, &s;uch as <HI>&s;ilks, laces,</HI> and the like, becau&s;e they may be <HI>ea&s;ily</HI> &s;muggled, &amp;c. Whenever they are to be &s;old, they mu&s;t be expo&s;ed to view, and let the <HI>burden of proof</HI> ever lie on the <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, that the tax has been bona fide paid.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hould think it advi&s;able to commit the management of this matter to the merchants; they are <HI>mo&s;t hurt</HI> by <HI>&s;mug|gling,</HI> and of cour&s;e have the <HI>highe&s;t intere&s;t</HI> in preventing it. It will be <HI>ten times more difficult</HI> to cheat and impo&s;e on them, than any others, becau&s;e the matter falls wholly within their <HI>own &s;phere of bu&s;ine&s;s. Two of a trade cannot cheat one another as ea&s;y</HI> as <HI>either</HI> of them might cheat <HI>a &s;tranger.</HI> If the merchants would take the matter up, and make it a kind of <HI>profe&s;&s;ional honor</HI> to prevent &s;muggling, and &s;ee that the duty is <HI>effectually paid,</HI> there is little doubt but <HI>they</HI> could effect it.</P>
<P>All this rea&s;oning depends on this one principle, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that our <HI>public mea&s;ures</HI> mu&s;t carry in them <HI>wi&s;dom, natural fitne&s;s, ju&s;tice,</HI> and <HI>propriety:</HI> then they will gain character, reputation, and confidence among the people at large, and mutual intere&s;t will &s;oon make the government ea&s;y and effective; every individual will &s;oon find his <HI>intere&s;t</HI> con|nected with <HI>that of the public,</HI> and he will have every in|ducement both of <HI>honor and profit</HI> to &s;tand well with the government, and effectually &s;upport it.</P>
<P>And in this way, even the great doctrine of taxation it|&s;elf, that <HI>common and almo&s;t univer&s;al &s;ource of complaint,</HI> may become an object of <HI>acknowledged nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> of <HI>confe&s;&s;ed

right,</HI> and the payment made like that of any other debt, with <HI>conviction of right and full &s;atisfaction.</HI></P>
<P>I will conclude this E&s;&s;ay with one argument more in fa|vor of my principle of taxation, which appears to me of &s;uch mighty weight and va&s;t importance, as mu&s;t reach the feelings, and govern the heart, of every upright <HI>American,</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>that our public union, with all its ble&s;&s;ings, depends on it, and is &s;upported by it,</HI> and mu&s;t, without it, di&s;&s;olve and wa&s;te away into its original atoms.</P>
<P>To refu&s;e any plan its <HI>nece&s;&s;ary &s;upport,</HI> and to <HI>murder and de&s;troy</HI> it, is the <HI>&s;ame thing;</HI> the union cannot be &s;up|ported without &s;o much money as is nece&s;&s;ary to that &s;up|port, and that money <HI>may be rai&s;ed in the way</HI> I propo&s;e, and <HI>cannot in any other.</HI> We have a mo&s;t plain and unde|niable proof of fact, that the u&s;ual mode of taxation of polls and e&s;tates, is in its principle <HI>unju&s;t</HI> and <HI>unequal,</HI> be|cau&s;e it does not operate on our people in any <HI>due proportion to their wealth:</HI> this mi&s;chief was le&s;s felt, when our taxes were <HI>very &s;mall,</HI> and therefore, tho' <HI>unju&s;t,</HI> were not <HI>ruinous;</HI> but the ca&s;e is greatly altered, now the taxes are <HI>grown up into the burden</HI> which the pre&s;ent exigencies of the na|tion require.</P>
<P>The &s;aid tax hitherto in u&s;e is further ruinous, becau&s;e it carves what money it does produce, out of the very <HI>fir&s;t re&s;ources,</HI> the <HI>original principle of our national wealth,</HI> which, like <HI>tender <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> &s;hould be <HI>nur&s;ed and guarded</HI> with all care, till they arrive to &s;trength and maturity;&mdash;then we may <HI>pluck the fruit</HI> without <HI>hurting the tree:</HI>&mdash;to cramp and di|mini&s;h any of the&s;e, is like making bread of our <HI>&s;eed wheat,</HI> or feeding our <HI>mowing grounds,</HI> every <HI>quantity</HI> we take <HI>le&s;|&s;ens the next crop ten;</HI> but what gives deci&s;ion to the point is, that we have the clear proof of experience, that the utmo&s;t efforts in this way have not been &s;ufficient to pro|duce <HI>one quarter</HI> of the &s;um nece&s;&s;ary for the public &s;ervice; nor is there any probability of an <HI>increa&s;ed</HI> production.</P>
<P>The mode of &s;upply by <HI>foreign loans</HI> need not be further reprobated; it is plain to every body, that if they can be continued (which is doubtful) they will &s;oon involve us in <HI>a foreign debt,</HI> va&s;tly beyond all <HI>po&s;&s;ibility of payment:</HI> our

<P>The &s;cheme of i&s;&s;uing any more Continental money, I take for granted, nobody will think of; and therefore I conclude, that all the ways and means which <HI>have hitherto been tried,</HI> have proved utterly in&s;ufficie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">or the purpo&s;e: and I further conceive, that it will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">, that the <HI>mode I propo&s;e,</HI> if put into practice, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> <HI>&s;ufficient.</HI> I further contend, that <HI>no other mod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> reach is or can be <HI>equally ea&s;y</HI> to the people, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> <HI>productive</HI> of &s;ufficient money for the various <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> our union; this is then the <HI>only practicable way</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> can be &s;up|ported, and of cour&s;e <HI>the union depends</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and, without it, mu&s;t inevitably fall to pieces.</P>
<P>To &s;ay all this, may be thought very <HI>great pre&s;umption</HI> in an individual; be it &s;o; &s;till I am &s;afe, for no man can contradict me, who is not able to find and explain &s;ome <HI>other way of &s;upply, equally ea&s;y</HI> to the people, and <HI>equally productive</HI> of all the money which the &s;upport of the union requires: but in as much as the eagerne&s;s of inquiry for &s;everal years pa&s;t has not been able to di&s;cover any <HI>&s;uch other mode,</HI> I conclude there is <HI>no &s;uch,</HI> and of cour&s;e, the one I have propo&s;ed is the only one that can be adopted, to &s;ave our union from di&s;&s;olution.</P>

<P>I am clearly of opinion, if our people have lo&s;t their confidence in our public coun&s;els, and are backward in pu&s;hing them into practice, the rea&s;on is, not becau&s;e they <HI>&s;tupid</HI> and <HI>blind</HI> to their intere&s;ts, or <HI>wanting in zeal</HI> to pro|mote them, but becau&s;e their <HI>courage</HI> is all <HI>worn out,</HI> and their <HI>patience exhau&s;ted,</HI> by a &s;even years' cour&s;e of <HI>vi&s;ionary, ineffectual, ill-contrived,</HI> and <HI>half-dige&s;ted</HI> plans, which pro|mi&s;ed little in <HI>theory,</HI> but con&s;tantly in <HI>practice,</HI> proved the ba&s;ele&s;s fabrics of a vi&s;ion, and vani&s;hed at la&s;t, not only <HI>without u&s;e,</HI> but with con&s;equences very <HI>detrimental</HI> to our national character of integrity and wi&s;dom, as well as to the intere&s;ts and morals of our people; not the lea&s;t di&s;|couraging of all which was this con&s;tant effect which they all had, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that tho&s;e States or individuals, which <HI>pro|moted them with mo&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">al, ardor, and effort, always lo&s;t mo&s;t by them.</HI></P>
<P>I am of opinion it is quite time to quit this <HI>childi&s;h mini|ature</HI> of coun&s;els, and adopt &s;omething <HI>up to the full life,</HI> and propo&s;e &s;ome &s;y&s;tem to our people, that will, when executed, be <HI>effective and &s;ufficient</HI> for it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> purpo&s;e. I ima|gine &s;uch a propo&s;al would find our people full enough of &s;en&s;e to di&s;cu&s;s it, candor to approve of it, and zeal to promote it.</P>
<P>But if you will continue to believe that my <HI>high &s;cale</HI> of tax will &s;tupify our people with terror on fir&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ight of the dreadful, dreary object, I will &s;eriou&s;ly a&s;k you if you are acquainted with one individual, who, you think, would be likely to hand him&s;elf, or run di&s;tracted, or give up the <HI>American</HI> Union or Independence, on being told, that he mu&s;t, for the re&s;t of his life, pay a <HI>dollar a gallon</HI> tax on di&s;tilled <HI>&s;pirits</HI> and <HI>win<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">;</HI> a duty equal to the <HI>fir&s;t co&s;t</HI> on <HI>&s;ilks, cambrics, lawns, mu&s;lins, laces, jewellery,</HI> and &s;o on thro' all the grades of the tax I propo&s;e.</P>
<P>Or how does the dreadful &s;pectre affect your own con|&s;titution? Does it make your own blood run cold and &s;tiffen in your veins? As you are mo&s;tly men of fa&s;hion

and fortune, I conceive you will be as deeply intere&s;ted i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the tax as the mo&s;t of your con&s;tituents, and you may pretty well judge of <HI>their feelings</HI> by <HI>your own.</HI> I do not apprehend that your anxiety is excited at all for your&s;elves, but for your people; but cannot you &s;uppo&s;e that your con&s;tituents have &s;en&s;e to di&s;cern the nece&s;&s;ity and utility of a public mea&s;ure, judgment and patrioti&s;m to approve it, and firmne&s;s to bear the burden of it, as well as you?</P>
<P>Some objects, when &s;een thro' a mi&s;t, or at a di&s;tance, appear frightful and clothed with terrors, which all vani&s;h on a <HI>nearer</HI> view, and more <HI>clo&s;e</HI> in&s;pection.

<P>Let us &s;uppo&s;e and realize to our&s;elves then, that my &s;cale of tax was adopted and become habitual to the peo|ple; can you imagine that the country would be thereby rendered a whit the wor&s;e, or more inconvenient to live in, than if the tax was not paid? or if you cannot come quite up to this, do you conceive the inconvenience of the tax paid in this way, by any compari&s;on <HI>&s;o heavy and burden|&s;ome,</HI> as the pre&s;ent tax on <HI>polls and e&s;tates,</HI> or any other <HI>of equal product,</HI> that has <HI>ever been practi&s;ed</HI> or <HI>propo&s;ed,</HI> would be to the people at large.</P>
<P>I do not know how far our people at large are impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e of the <HI>importance of our union;</HI> it is, in my opinion, an object of the utmo&s;t weight; I conceive that the very exi&s;tence of our <HI>re&s;pectability abroad,</HI> the intere&s;t which we are to derive from our <HI>connexions with foreign nations,</HI> and our <HI>&s;ecurity</HI> again&s;t foreign and dome&s;tic in&s;ults and inva&s;ions, <HI>all depend on it,</HI> and even our <HI>independence</HI> it&s;elf cannot be &s;upported <HI>without it;</HI> and as I know well that the attachment of our people to their independence is al|mo&s;t univer&s;al, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e that our union, which is &s;o clo&s;ely and in&s;eparably connected with it, would like|wi&s;e be an equal object of their attachment and concern.</P>
<P>If this is the ca&s;e, I cannot be per&s;uaded that our peo|ple will revolt again&s;t any rea&s;onable and nece&s;&s;ary means of &s;upporting both the one and the other, and as the tax I propo&s;e appears to me the <HI>only po&s;&s;ible</HI> and <HI>practicable

means,</HI> any how within our power, which can be <HI>adequate</HI> to this great purpo&s;e, I cannot &s;ay that I &s;hudder to pro|po&s;e &s;uch a tax; but I think we may &s;afely pre&s;ume on the <HI>good &s;en&s;e of our people,</HI> their <HI>patience, and di&s;cernment</HI> of their intere&s;ts, enough to expect their concurrence in the mea&s;ure, and even cheerfulne&s;s and zeal in &s;upporting it.</P>
<P>But if this cannot be obtained, I can add no more; I have no conception that the <HI>Americans</HI> either <HI>can</HI> or <HI>ought</HI> to be governed <HI>again&s;t</HI> their con&s;ent, or that the collection of taxes, of any kind, or in any mode, can be made with &s;ucce&s;s, whil&s;t an opinion becomes general among the peo|ple, that the <HI>taxes</HI> are <HI>unnece&s;&s;ary, unju&s;t, or improperly ap|plied.</HI></P>
<P>I think it would not be very difficult to make out <HI>the de|tail of particulars</HI> nece&s;&s;ary to form the plan or &s;y&s;tem, both of the tax and its collection, on the principles herein urged; but the whole is humbly &s;ubmitted to the con&s;ide|ration of the public, who, I hope, are enough impre&s;&s;ed with the importance of the &s;ubject, and the nece&s;&s;ity of adopting &s;ome deci&s;ions relating to it, without delay, to induce every one to give it that attention that its <HI>nature and weight</HI> requires, and which our pre&s;ent critical circum|&s;tances make indi&s;pen&s;able to our political &s;alvation.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It may be of u&s;e to the reader, to advert to &s;ome particulars of the &s;tate and condition of the country and its revenues, at the time when this E&s;&s;ay was fir&s;t publi&s;hed.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Continental money</HI> had been entirely <HI>out of circulation</HI> near two years, and all kinds of <HI>e&s;timates, payments,</HI> and <HI>accounts</HI> were made in <HI>hard money.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. That the <HI>Bank of North-America</HI> was in&s;tituted by Congre&s;s, and pret|ty well e&s;tabli&s;hed at <HI>Philadelphia:</HI> the charter of it bears date <HI>Dec.</HI> 31, 1781.</P>
<P N="3">3. Very &s;trong exertions had been made to <HI>obtain money from the States,</HI> by a tax levied on polls and e&s;tates in the old and u&s;ual way, and &s;uch convic|tion of the nece&s;&s;ity of public &s;upplies generally took place thro' the States, that con&s;iderable &s;ums were obtained in this way, and remitted in bank bills to the Financier General, mr. <HI>Morris.</HI></P>
<P>But the&s;e taxes were levied by the States neither in any <HI>due proportion</HI> of quotas, nor with any <HI>equality</HI> of either <HI>quantity</HI> or <HI>punctuality</HI> in the pay|ments, and as no <HI>power of compul&s;ion was ve&s;ted in Congre&s;s</HI> at that time, the &s;upplies <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ell <HI>va&s;tly &s;hort</HI> of the public exigencies; large loans indeed were negotiated abroad, and many wild and vain &s;chemes for rai&s;ing money were propo&s;ed at home; but all was languor and deficiency.</P>
<P N="4">4. A &s;trong and laborious effort was made by Congre&s;s for <HI>an impo&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of only five per cent. on imported goods,</HI> which, with great difficulty and delay, <HI>was at la&s;t ratified</HI> by all the States <HI>except Rhode-I&s;land,</HI> which, by its <HI>final negative,</HI> fru&s;trated the plan, rendered it wholly void, and it died without any effect.</P>
<P N="5">5. A very con&s;iderable <HI>foreign debt </HI> was contracted, and every depart|ment at home was <HI>deeply involved,</HI> and <HI>no payments could be made</HI> either at home or abroad; it was with the <HI>utmo&s;t difficulty</HI> that money could be pro|cured for <HI>daily &s;upplies,</HI> which were ab&s;olutely indi&s;pen&s;able.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Very great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> were due to the army,</HI> and had there not been <HI>more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"></HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the <HI>army,</HI> and <HI>greater <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> their <HI>General</HI> and <HI>other officers,</HI> than &s;carce ever exi&s;ted before, it would have been impo&s;&s;ible to have <HI>kept them together,</HI> or to have <HI>governed</HI> them with any proper <HI>di&s;cipline.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. We were ju&s;t upon the clo&s;e of the war; the peace was expected &s;oon; the preliminary articles of it were indeed &s;ettled and &s;igned, <HI>Jan.</HI> 20, 1783, but the advice of them had not reached <HI>America</HI> at that time: but,</P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>Peace,</HI> tho' the mo&s;t <HI>de&s;irable</HI> of all things at that time, yet was clothed <HI>with terrors,</HI> and the near approach of it excited the mo&s;t <HI>anxious apprehen&s;ions.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>murmurs</HI> of the army <HI>for their pay</HI> ran high; there was no money <HI>to pay</HI> them, yet they were to be <HI>di&s;banded;</HI> and <HI>whether they would &s;uffer them|&s;elves to be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and &s;ent to their &s;everal homes, without their pay,</HI> was a que&s;tion of great importance.</P>
<P>The&s;e difficulties were afterwards obviated by the prudence of General <HI>Wa&s;hington,</HI> but in a way that harrowed up all his feelings; he ordered &s;mall divi&s;ions of the army to be marched off to diver&s;e di&s;tant places, and then directed them to be <HI>di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, without any pay</HI> indeed, but <HI>with a profu|&s;ion of promi&s;es</HI> and <HI>a&s;&s;urances</HI> that &s;peedy provi&s;ion &s;hould be made for the &s;ettlement and payment of their accounts.</P>
<P>Commi&s;&s;ioners were indeed appointed to &s;ettle all unliquidated public ac|counts, both of the army and other creditors, but <HI>no payments</HI> were made but <HI>in certificates</HI> of the debts due, with promi&s;e to pay them with intere&s;t to the creditor or <HI>bearer.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e were <HI>worth about 2s. 6d. in the pound,</HI> and the circulation of them &s;oon became very great <HI>at that exchange:</HI> but to return to the time of writ|ing this E&s;&s;ay&mdash;</P>
<P N="9">9. Tho' the <HI>public trea&s;ury was &s;o very poor and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed,</HI> yet the States were <HI>really overrun with an abundance of ca&s;h:</HI> the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> armies, our <HI>foreign loans, Havanna trade,</HI> &amp;c. had filled the country with <HI>money,</HI> and <HI>bills on Europe</HI> were currently &s;old at 20 to 40 per cent. <HI>below par.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. This induced the merchants to buy the&s;e bills, and remit them to <HI>Europe,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in return to import great quantities of <HI>European</HI> goods, which arrived under the great expen&s;e of a <HI>war freight</HI> and <HI>in&s;urance;</HI> yet their <HI>&s;carcity,</HI> the great <HI>plenty of ca&s;h,</HI> and the <HI>luxury and pride</HI> of the people were &s;uch, that they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">old <HI>rapidly</HI> and to <HI>great profit;</HI> all which made the <HI>tax of impo&s;t</HI> I propo&s;ed, very peculiarly <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> at that time for many rea&s;ons; not only,</P>
<P N="1">1. To &s;upply the trea&s;ury; but,</P>
<P N="2">2. To re&s;train and check the <HI>luxurious con&s;umptions</HI> which were growing fa&s;t into fa&s;hion.</P>
<P N="3">3. To keep up the price of goods, and thereby &s;ave the merchants from ruin, or at lea&s;t, from very great lo&s;s, by the reduction of the price of their goods on hand, which would be the natural con&s;equence of the peace.</P>
<P N="4">4. To prevent a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of imported goods</HI> flowing in upon us, which &s;oon drained the country of its ca&s;h, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">illed the States with luxury; but the tax would have either <HI>prevented</HI> the evil, or would have brought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>immen&s;e &s;um into the public trea&s;ury,</HI> which would have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;ed our public embarra&s;&s;|ments.</P>
<P>Perhaps both might have been produced by the tax to &s;uch a degree, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> have afforded <HI>very great and de&s;irable advantages;</HI> but the mea&s;ure was not adopted, tho' I believe every one regrets at this day that it was not then pur&s;ued.</P>
<P>The principles of it have &s;ince been adopted by the <HI>now Congre&s;s,</HI> and tho' on a much <HI>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ale</HI> than I propo&s;ed, yet we find the tax richly productive, and very little burden&s;ome to our people.</P></NOTE></P>

Of the&s;e there are a great varie|ty, and di&s;tingui&s;hed by divers appellations, &s;uch as <HI>loan-office certificates, depreciation certificates, final &s;ettlements,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>

As the public was in no condition to pay the&s;e &s;ecuri|ties when they became due, they &s;uffered <HI>a great deprecia|tion:</HI> the owners &s;old them for what they could get, and they have long been <HI>an article of traffic</HI> in the hands of the <HI>brokers</HI> and <HI>&s;peculators;</HI> and the price-current, or e&s;timated

value of them, as they pa&s;s from hand to hand, is become as much <HI>fixed</HI> and as <HI>well known</HI> in the brokers' offices, as that of any <HI>other goods</HI> or merchandi&s;es.</P>
<P>And this <HI>price-current,</HI> made in market by the general con&s;ent of buyers and &s;ellers, <HI>determines the value</HI> of all ar|ticles of traffic, whether <HI>goods, bills of exchange, public &s;e|curities, &s;tocks</HI> of every kind, or even <HI>money it&s;elf:</HI> and this rule of e&s;timation is &s;o <HI>fixed</HI> and natural, that no external force or height of authority can <HI>alter</HI> it, as has been clear|ly proved by experiment (the &s;tronge&s;t proof in nature) in the in&s;tances of <HI>tender-laws and regulation of prices,</HI> which have often been attempted <HI>in vain,</HI> tho' pu&s;hed as far <HI>as law, authority, violence,</HI> and <HI>force</HI> could go.</P>
<P>Therefore it follows, that the public &s;ecurities, when they become articles of exchange or traffic, are really <HI>worth</HI> what they will <HI>bring</HI> in market, and no more; <HI>i. e. let their nominal value be what it will, their real value is &s;o much as, and no more than, they will bring in market:</HI> this is plain, natural law, which it is in vain for the greate&s;t force or highe&s;t authority to oppo&s;e; it will prove too &s;trong for the mo&s;t mighty oppo&s;ition; it is therefore mo&s;t wi&s;e to &s;ubmit to it, and obey its &s;overeign dictates, without reluctance.</P>
<P>The price-current of public &s;ecurities has been different at different times, and the different kinds of them are e&s;ti|mated at different prices; very many have been purcha&s;ed at 2<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> in the pound, or 8 for 1; others at 6<HI>s.</HI> or 7<HI>s.</HI> in the pound, or about 3 for 1. A few in&s;tances may be produced of &s;ales at higher and lower prices; but in gene|ral, I believe, the above prices may be e&s;timated as the ex|tremes: very great numbers of <HI>final &s;ettlements</HI> have been bought at 2<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> in the pound, or 8 for 1.</P>
<P>It is very certain, and undoubtedly confe&s;&s;ed on all &s;ides that our <HI>&s;oldiers,</HI> when their <HI>&s;ervices were over,</HI> and their accounts were fairly adju&s;ted, were entitled to the liquidat|ed balances in their favor, in <HI>genuine money<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> this was <HI>in ju&s;tice</HI> due to them for their &s;ervices, and if they were paid, <HI>no more than ju&s;tice</HI> was done them; but if, in&s;tead of this, they were paid nominally <HI>twenty &s;hillings</HI> in a certificate, note of public promi&s;e, or any other article of negotiation

or traffic, which was worth, by general con&s;ent of buyer and &s;eller, in the public exchange, <HI>no more than 2s. 6d.</HI> and would bring no more, it is plain they were paid but 2<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> in the pound, and the <HI>remaining 17s. 6d. is &s;till due to them.</HI></P>
<P>We will &s;uppo&s;e, that in&s;tead of a certificate of 20<HI>s.</HI> which would bring but 2<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> they had been paid <HI>in bra&s;s,</HI> at <HI>20s. per lb.</HI> which was worth in market, and would bring <HI>no more than, 2s. 6d. per lb.</HI> it is plain their condition would have been exactly the &s;ame, <HI>i. e.</HI> the &s;oldier that re|ceived the <HI>pound of bra&s;s,</HI> which he could &s;ell for 2<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> and no more, would be ju&s;t as well off, and as well paid, as the &s;oldier who received the <HI>certificate of 20s.</HI> which he could &s;ell for 2<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> and no more; it is a very plain ca&s;e that neither of them are paid more than 2<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> in the pound, and that the remaining 17<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> remains unpaid, and con&s;equently due to them.</P>
<P>And if any <HI>ju&s;tice of honor to the public faith</HI> is de&s;igned or attempted, if mu&s;t be effected by <HI>paying</HI> to them what &s;till <HI>remains due</HI> to them. But can the human mind con|ceive, that any &s;ort of ju&s;tice or honor to the public faith would be done, not by <HI>pitying</HI> the poor &s;oldiers, and <HI>paying</HI> the balance due to them, but in&s;tead of this, by rai&s;ing a large &s;um of money, by taxing the community, to buy in <HI>all the bra&s;s,</HI> and giving 20<HI>s.</HI> per lb. for it to the &s;peculators who had bought it of the &s;oldiers for 2<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> per lb. (even whil&s;t the current market price was but 2<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI>) and giving intere&s;t till the ca&s;h was paid? which would be giving tho&s;e &s;peculators <HI>eight times</HI> as much money as the <HI>capital</HI> they advanced, and 48 <HI>per cent. per ann. intere&s;t</HI> for it, till the ca&s;h was paid.</P>
<P>The brokers' intere&s;t of 4 per cent. per month, is a fool to this; for this not only recovers 4 <HI>per cent. per month in|tere&s;t,</HI> but &s;ecures the payment of <HI>eight-fold the capital,</HI> when the intere&s;t cea&s;es. Be&s;ides, the brokers run &s;ome ri&s;k of <HI>opprobrium and lo&s;s</HI> of their debt; but this plan gives <HI>honor and &s;ecurity</HI> to the whole tran&s;action, by giving it the &s;a|cred &s;anction of the &s;upreme power of the State.</P>

It makes no difference to the argument, whether the ar|ticle to traffic paid to the &s;oldiers, and purcha&s;ed in again by the State, be <HI>bra&s;s</HI> or <HI>certificates;</HI> becau&s;e both, by the &s;uppo&s;ition, are of <HI>equal price</HI> in the market, and make a payment of <HI>equal value</HI> to the &s;oldiers.</P>
<P>The whole argument holds good and in equal force, with regard to all <HI>original holders</HI> of public &s;ecurities, as to the <HI>&s;oldiers,</HI> all of whom are &s;uppo&s;ed to have furni&s;hed to the public, <HI>ca&s;h, goods, or &s;ervices,</HI> to the amount of the certificates they received.</P>
<P>The argument al&s;o has the &s;ame force, with re&s;pect to &s;peculators, who have purcha&s;ed public &s;ecurities at a <HI>higher exchange</HI> than 8 for 1: with re&s;pect to the&s;e, the conclu&s;ion is the &s;ame in <HI>nature,</HI> but differs only in <HI>degree.</HI></P>
<P>This plan of paying the va&s;t &s;ums of public monies to &s;peculators, which were originally due to the &s;oldiers and other original holders of the public &s;ecurities, and the pay|ment being <HI>withheld</HI> from them to whom it ought to have been made, <HI>&s;till remains due:</HI> I &s;ay, the plan of paying the&s;e monies to the &s;peculators, who at pre&s;ent hold the &s;ecurities, <HI>i. e.</HI> paying to the&s;e &s;peculators <HI>eight times</HI> the capital they advanced for the purcha&s;e of them, <HI>with 48 per cent. per ann. intere&s;t,</HI> till actual payment is made to them, and taxing the State to rai&s;e the&s;e monies, and of cour&s;e <HI>taxing the poor &s;oldiers</HI> (who, in their penury and di&s;|tre&s;s, &s;old their certificates at 2<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI>) in the pound, for the <HI>money</HI> nece&s;&s;ary <HI>to pay them at 20s.</HI> in the pound, with in|tere&s;t, to the &s;peculators who purcha&s;ed them: I &s;ay, this plan is adopted by &s;ome folks with great &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and gravity; and their ideas are &s;upported with very &s;pecious arguments, the detail of which I wave con&s;idering ju&s;t now, that I may mention one propo&s;ition, which I think nece&s;&s;ary to introduce here, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>
<P><HI>No ingenuity of argument</HI> can ever &s;upport <HI>an ab&s;urd con|clu&s;ion;</HI> the ab&s;urdity of the conclu&s;ion for ever de&s;troys the argument, however &s;pecious and ingenious the pre|mi&s;es may be found: this is called by logicians <HI>reductio ad ab&s;urdum,</HI> has been taught in the &s;chools a thou&s;and years, and has always been allowed to be good rea&s;oning.</P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="023972_0281_0FC2AFFB32B8FC40">
All the arguments that can be adduced, can never con|vince any body that this plan is right; there is not a <HI>boy</HI> in a compting-hou&s;e, or <HI>maid</HI> in a kitchen, who would not exclaim again&s;t the inju&s;tice of it, the moment they heard and under&s;tood it; the <HI>common &s;en&s;e</HI> which re&s;ides in every human brea&s;t, <HI>revolts</HI> again&s;t it; for this I appeal to the &s;entiments and feelings of every body who has any.</P>
<P>Do not you think, my fellow-citizens, that a &s;peculator in public &s;ecurities mu&s;t be pretty well brazed, yea, bra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ed over, who can <HI>expre&s;s his joy</HI> without blu&s;hing, in the face of the world, and tell us that he is <HI>enlivened</HI> with hopes of obtaining a public act, entitling him to <HI>eight times the capi|tal</HI> of his &s;peculations, with 48 <HI>per cent. per ann. intere&s;t,</HI> till he receives the principal in <HI>good, &s;olid, hard ca&s;h;</HI> all which he knows to be the <HI>earnings</HI> of the poor, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;oldier, who, with his family, langui&s;hes for want of the payment, which is withheld from him by means of the <HI>failure of the public faith?</HI></P>
<P>This plan, however cruel, &s;hocking, and execrable it may appear, is defended by &s;ome folks by this argument, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the <HI>public &s;ecurities, like bonds, bills of exchange, pro|mi&s;&s;ory notes,</HI> &amp;c. are a&s;&s;ignable or transferable over, by which the a&s;&s;ignee becomes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of <HI>all the right and intere&s;t,</HI> which the <HI>original holder</HI> had therein; that the whole property pa&s;&s;es by the a&s;&s;ignment, and the &s;um paid by the a&s;&s;ignee to the original holder, whether <HI>little or much,</HI> is of no con&s;ideration in the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e this holds true <HI>generally</HI> with re&s;pect to bonds, bills of exchange, promi&s;&s;ory notes, &amp;c. but I do not think it holds true <HI>univer&s;ally:</HI> the rule has its exceptions, and I think the <HI>ca&s;e in point</HI> is manife&s;tly one of the <HI>&s;tronge&s;t in&s;tances</HI> of them. The <HI>Continental money</HI> is a mo&s;t notori|ous one; the <HI>public faith</HI> was plighted for the redemption of <HI>that money,</HI> as &s;acredly as <HI>force</HI> of words, <HI>height</HI> of au|thority, and <HI>appeals to Heaven</HI> could do it. Yet every man acknowledges, that if that money, tho' all made <HI>payable to the bearer,</HI> was to be redeemed at a <HI>hard dollar</HI> for every <HI>Continental one,</HI> the mo&s;t ab&s;urd <HI>inju&s;tice</HI> would be done.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="023972_0282_0FC2AFFCB053CBB0">
The <HI>old State money</HI> of this State affords another in&s;tance of the &s;ame kind. The <HI>loan-office certificates</HI> afford a third in&s;tance, the value of which is e&s;timated by Congre&s;s, by a public <HI>&s;cale of depreciation,</HI> grounded on the <HI>real value of the certificates,</HI> at the &s;everal <HI>dates</HI> at which they were i&s;|&s;ued. Nobody pretends to object to this mea&s;ure<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> or the principle on which it was founded.</P>
<P>Another in&s;tance may be adduced from a clear, decided rule of the law of the land, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> if an executor buys up the bonds of his te&s;tator at a di&s;count, <HI>i. e.</HI> by paying le&s;s than the nominal value for them, when he comes to make up the accounts of his executor&s;hip, he &s;hall not be allow|ed the <HI>nominal value</HI> of tho&s;e bonds, but &s;o much only as he <HI>actually paid</HI> for them.</P>
<P>To all this I will venture to add here a propo&s;ed ca&s;e, with my opinion on it, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> &s;uppo&s;e a merchant &s;tops pay|ment, who has thou&s;ands of bonds, notes, &amp;c. again&s;t him, and upon the be&s;t &s;urvey of his affairs, it becomes the general opinion that he will pay 2<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> in the pound, and his <HI>bonds and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">otes</HI> are generally pa&s;&s;ed from hand to to hand, <HI>at that exchange.</HI> Every broker and banker has them, and pa&s;&s;es them for years together at that rate; but, after a &s;eries of time, the debtor becomes able and willing to pay his whole debt, and is cited into a mo&s;t &s;overeign court of chancery, where <HI>mere right and ju&s;tice</HI> is the rule of the court; where it is confe&s;&s;ed that the 2<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> is either paid or now due to the a&s;&s;ignee of the note for 20<HI>s.</HI> and the &s;ole que&s;tion before the court is, <HI>who &s;hall have the other 17s. 6d.</HI> whether the <HI>original creditor,</HI> to whom the debt was due, for full con&s;ideration paid, or to the a&s;&s;ignee who had never paid <HI>any thing</HI> for it?</P>
<P>We will &s;uppo&s;e the court is under no bias, but <HI>hone&s;tly</HI> mean to make &s;uch a decree as will be <HI>mo&s;t ju&s;t,</HI> do the <HI>mo&s;t honor</HI> to their court, and be <HI>be&s;t approved in Heaven.</HI> I make no difficulty in giving my opinion, that the court will award in favor of the original creditor, who has paid the <HI>full con&s;ideration</HI> of the debt, in preference to the a&s;&s;ignee, who has <HI>never paid any thing</HI> for it.</P>

Find fault with and di&s;prove this opinion, whoever of you can; I expo&s;e it with confidence, to the cen&s;ure of you all. Where two per&s;ons are in equal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an e&s;tate, <HI>it &s;hall be given to him that hath right. Original right</HI> is &s;uch a <HI>&s;acred thing,</HI> that it can and will go great lengths in favor of its proprietor, is ever <HI>reverenced by the law,</HI> and ever claims the principal <HI>attention of the court.</HI></P>
<P>I take it, that the facts out of which <HI>the rea&s;ons grow,</HI> that govern a&s;&s;ignments of bonds, bills of exchange, and negotiable notes, are &s;o <HI>toto c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">elo</HI> different from tho&s;e in the ca&s;e now under di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to argue from the one to the other without the mo&s;t manife&s;t ab|&s;urdity.</P>
<P>One in&s;tance of this difference, of full notoriety, and &s;triking enough, is this, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that in the ca&s;e of transfer of bills of exchange, negotiable notes, &amp;c. a <HI>valuable con|&s;ideration</HI> is always pre&s;umed to be given; but in the ca&s;e in point <HI>no &s;uch thing,</HI> but the <HI>very contrary, appears</HI> in full blaze of evidence; 2<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> in the pound has not the <HI>lea&s;t preten&s;ion</HI> of being a valuable con&s;ideration for <HI>eight times</HI> the principal advanced, and 48 <HI>per cent. intere&s;t</HI> for the &s;ame, till the whole &s;hall be paid, together with 48 per cent. for &s;everal years' intere&s;t due on the certificate, <HI>before the pur|cha&s;er ever &s;aw it,</HI> or even <HI>paid his 2s. 6d. for it.</HI></P>
<P>This fact &s;tands glaring in the <HI>face of the world,</HI> and &s;trikes conviction of its own inju&s;tice and ab&s;urdity into every beholder; it gives concern to the mo&s;t avaricious &s;peculator, and brings a <HI>blu&s;h</HI> even into the <HI>anvil counte|nances</HI> of the &s;anguine promoters of the ble&s;&s;ed &s;cheme of making provi&s;ion for the enormous payment.</P>
<P>They endeavour to <HI>palliate</HI> it, or <HI>&s;huffle it out of &s;ight,</HI> by &s;ugge&s;ting that the in&s;tances of this &s;ort are but <HI>few</HI> and incon&s;iderable, and &s;o blended with the right and ju&s;tice due to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed widows, orphans, &s;oldiers, and other worthy citizens, who are public creditors, that they can|not be &s;eparated, and are therefore not worthy to be no|ticed; but here again the fact is notoriou&s;ly again&s;t them. I &s;hould think a man had need of a <HI>front as hard as an

andiron,</HI> to affirm, in the face of the public, that <HI>the&s;e in|&s;tances are but few and incon&s;iderable.</HI></P>
<P>It is a matter of public notoriety and general belief, that almo&s;t the <HI>whole</HI> of the <HI>widows, orphans, &s;oldiers,</HI> and other <HI>di&s;tre&s;&s;ed public creditors,</HI> have &s;old their certifi|cates, which are now in the hands of the &s;peculators, who are known to be very numerous, and many of whom have a va&s;t amount of them.</P>
<P>But let the&s;e in&s;tances be few or many, it is a vain pre|tence to &s;ay they are <HI>&s;o blended with the other public credi|tors, that they cannot be &s;eparated.</HI> A method of <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>due di&s;crimination</HI> is <HI>ea&s;ily inve&s;tigated;</HI> the public creditors are <HI>ea&s;ily found;</HI> their <HI>names</HI> are all on the <HI>public books,</HI> with the <HI>balances which were due to them</HI> when their accounts were &s;ettled.</P>
<P>I propo&s;e then, that <HI>they &s;hall be debited with the certifi|cates they received, at the price, exchange, or value at which they pa&s;&s;ed or could be &s;old, when they received them, and have the re&s;idue of their balance paid to them hone&s;tly, with intere&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>It will take <HI>no more money</HI> to pay <HI>them</HI> than to pay the <HI>&s;peculators;</HI> and as to the certificates, except &s;uch as are in the hands of the <HI>original holders,</HI> let them be paid <HI>to who|ever brings them in,</HI> at a &s;cale of value founded on their ori|ginal value when they were i&s;&s;ued, or the mean exchange at which they have pa&s;&s;ed for two or three years back.</P>
<P>This will repay to the &s;peculators all the ca&s;h they have advanced, which, I think, is all the ju&s;tice or tenderne&s;s to which they are entitled from the public; for, to &s;ay the be&s;t of them, I e&s;teem them a &s;ort of men <HI>barely tolerable,</HI> but by no means worthy of <HI>encouragement.</HI></P>
<P>Some people &s;ay they have merit, and &s;upport the pub|lic faith, by giving <HI>&s;omething</HI> for certificates, when others would <HI>not buy them at all;</HI> but I think we are not much beholden to them, for vilifying and decrying the public faith, till they have per&s;uaded the poor &s;oldiers to &s;ell their certificates for 2<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> in the pound, rather than tru&s;t the public any longer.</P>
<P>As my propo&s;al leaves no ground of complaint on the part of the &s;peculators, &s;o I think it will do manife&s;t ju&s;tice

<P>I &s;ay, the&s;e two parties are the original creditors and the a&s;&s;ignees of the bonds who appear before this court, and the grand que&s;tion now before the court is, whether they will pay the&s;e public monies to the <HI>&s;oldiers</HI> and <HI>other</HI> virtuous <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">izens,</HI> who are the <HI>original creditors;</HI> or whether they will pay the&s;e &s;ame monies to a <HI>parcel of &s;tock-jobbers and &s;peculators</HI> in the public funds and &s;ecurities, at the rate of 8 for 1 of the principal they have advanced, and 48 per cent. per ann. intere&s;t, till the principal is paid, together with 48 per cent. intere&s;t from the date of the certificate, to the time of the purcha&s;e of it by the &s;peculator, which, in &s;ome ca&s;es, is &s;everal years, and rai&s;es the intere&s;t due on the certificates at the time of purcha&s;e, to a <HI>much greater &s;um</HI> than was paid for the <HI>whole certificate?</HI></P>
<P>We will then, if you plea&s;e, &s;uppo&s;e our venerable high court of chancery, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> our A&s;&s;embly, to be &s;itting, with the public monies all on the table before them; and the two parties appear and make their claim to the money; it is confe&s;&s;ed that the public have had a valuable con&s;ide|ration for it, and therefore ju&s;tly owe it to &s;omebody, and the only que&s;tion before the court is, <HI>who &s;hall have it?</HI></P>
<P>The &s;peculators bring in their certificates &s;igned over to them, and claim to be admitted <HI>in the place of the original creditors,</HI> and <HI>paid</HI> as &s;uch, on the <HI>equity</HI> and common <HI>rea|&s;on of a&s;&s;ignments.</HI></P>

the <HI>remainder</HI> of the debt due from the public to us at the time of &s;ettlement, is <HI>&s;till due</HI> to us and <HI>unpaid,</HI> and we now <HI>claim it.</HI> The &s;peculators have no &s;uch plea of a va|luable <HI>con&s;ideration given;</HI> they have purcha&s;ed at &s;uch va&s;t di&s;count, that they have no preten&s;ions to a valuable con&s;i|deration given; what they have paid we are content they &s;hould <HI>receive back</HI> with intere&s;t; the <HI>re&s;t</HI> is our <HI>dear earn|ings,</HI> which the public have had the <HI>full benefit</HI> of, and which we now claim as <HI>our due,</HI> and <HI>demand payment.</HI></P>
<P>This is &s;tating the matter, I conceive, clearly and fairly, and I beg leave to give my opinion decidedly in favor of the original creditors. It does appear to me, that the <HI>quid pro quo, or valuable con&s;ideration, goes &s;o into the nature, and makes &s;uch a part of, the very e&s;&s;ence of commutative ju&s;tice, that it is impo&s;&s;ible that an equitable debt &s;hould be generated without it, by any contract whatever.</HI></P>
<P>It is a matter of the mo&s;t public notoriety, that the <HI>quid pro quo,</HI> or valuable con&s;ideration paid by the &s;peculators, is <HI>no more than the exchange</HI> at which they purcha&s;ed the certificates, which is &s;uch a <HI>mere trifle,</HI> that it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">onts the common feelings of the human mind, to pretend that &s;uch a trifle (&s;ay, one &s;ixth or eighth part) is a valuable con&s;ide|ration for <HI>the whole;</HI> it is a valuable con&s;ideration for <HI>no more than was paid,</HI> and of con&s;equence can generate a debt of <HI>no more;</HI> the <HI>re&s;t</HI> &s;till &s;tands connected with the original con&s;ideration paid, <HI>i. e. &s;ticks</HI> to the original credi|tor, and there will adhere, till it is di&s;charged by an ade|quate payment.</P>
<P>For no man is <HI>born</HI> with, or <HI>can acquire,</HI> a right to the <HI>earnings</HI> or <HI>fortune</HI> of another, without giving a <HI>valuable con&s;ideration</HI> for it, and that con&s;ideration mu&s;t be of <HI>ade|quate value;</HI> for a <HI>penny</HI> can no more be a valuable con&s;ide|ration for a <HI>pound,</HI> than <HI>nothing</HI> at all can be for a <HI>penny:</HI> for it &s;trikes the human under&s;tanding as plainly, and with as much force, that a <HI>pound</HI> is worth more than a <HI>penny,</HI> as that a <HI>penny</HI> is worth more than <HI>nothing at all.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore I do conclude, and contend &s;trongly for the conclu&s;ion, that the &s;peculators are entitled to no more than they have paid a valuable con&s;ideration for, and <HI>the
<PB N="281" REF="023972_0288_0FC2B04CDB8C3730">
re&s;t remains due</HI> to the original creditors, as their <HI>dear earn|ings</HI> for which they have <HI>not yet been paid.</HI></P>
<P>I know very well that the &s;peculators have many ingeni|ous arguments, &s;pun as fine as &s;ilk, to prove their right to the whole debt &s;pecified in their certificates; but the &s;ol|dier has a much better one, &s;trong as iron, yea, made of iron, I mean his <HI>earnings with &s;word and mu&s;ket,</HI> thro' a &s;even years' war, which yet remain <HI>un&s;atisfied.</HI> Do you think that the fine&s;t &s;ilken arguments of the &s;peculator can &s;tand any the lea&s;t chance with this iron one of the &s;ol|dier?</P>
<P>There is &s;omething in <HI>original right,</HI> which &s;trikes the human mind w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> irre&s;i&s;tible force: this <HI>original right</HI> will for ever attach it&s;elf to <HI>original earnings;</HI> there it will <HI>&s;tick,</HI> and cannot be <HI>torn</HI> away by any force, nor be <HI>decoyed</HI> by any fraud, till it is <HI>&s;atisfied</HI> by adequate payment. A <HI>ju&s;t debt</HI> will for ever <HI>remain a debt due, till it is paid.</HI></P>
<P>It therefore follows, that if we pay the &s;peculators the immen&s;e &s;ums which they demand, the public debt of the whole &s;um will <HI>&s;till remain due to the original creditors,</HI> who have, by their <HI>ca&s;h, &s;upplies,</HI> and <HI>earnings,</HI> advanced the full, valuable con&s;ideration, out of which the debt fir&s;t grew, and who have <HI>never been paid.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Public ju&s;tice</HI> and the honor of the <HI>public faith</HI> require, not only that we pay as <HI>much money</HI> as we owe, <HI>but that we pay it to the per&s;ons to whom it is due;</HI> for paying it to any <HI>body el&s;e</HI> can be no &s;atisfaction of that ju&s;tice and faith which we owe to our <HI>real creditors,</HI> but is an additional injury to them.</P>
<P>The human mind can no otherwi&s;e know <HI>right and wrong,</HI> than by the <HI>force and manner</HI> in which they &s;trike the mind, and rai&s;e an <HI>approbation or di&s;approbation</HI> in it; and I appeal to the <HI>feelings</HI> of all my readers, whether my propo&s;itions do not <HI>&s;trike</HI> their minds &s;trongly, and <HI>force their approbation</HI> of my conclu&s;ion. I challenge the hardi|e&s;t &s;peculator to believe it <HI>right,</HI> if he can, or rather not to believe it <HI>wrong,</HI> to lay the burden of a tax on the com|munity, and among the re&s;t on the <HI>public creditors them|&s;elves,</HI> to rai&s;e money to pay the public debt, and when it
<PB N="282" REF="023972_0289_0FC2B053AA0FAB70">
is collected, to pay it away, not to the <HI>real creditors,</HI> who, by their earnings and advances, have paid the full con&s;ide|ration for the debts due to them, but to <HI>others who never earned</HI> any thing for us, nor paid any valuable con&s;ideration to us, and, of con&s;equence, can have nothing due to them from us.</P>
<P>There is another very &s;erious con&s;equence, which I ap|prehend from our paying &s;uch an enormous &s;um to the &s;pe|culators, as they demand, if we now had the whole mo|ney in the trea&s;ury, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> it would be &s;uch a drain of our public money, as would put it wholly <HI>out of our power to pay our real creditors</HI> in any tolerable &s;ea&s;on, and would, in a great mea&s;ure, <HI>reduce them to de&s;pair,</HI> of ever receiving their debts due, and of cour&s;e would greatly le&s;&s;en all <HI>con|fidence in the public faith.</HI></P>
<P>But if the money is not in the public trea&s;ury (which I take to be the fact) our i&s;&s;uing another deluge of <HI>public promi&s;es,</HI> by way of <HI>funding</HI> &s;uch an enormous &s;um, I fear would hurt the credit of the State &s;till more; for <HI>public promi&s;es,</HI> like all other promi&s;es that are broken, become of <HI>le&s;s and le&s;s value,</HI> the oftener they are <HI>repeated,</HI> and the more they are <HI>multiplied;</HI> and tho' I profe&s;s to believe ful|ly, that the&s;e new and multiplied public bills would be good enough to pay the &s;peculators with, yet I &s;hould be &s;orry that our <HI>real creditors</HI> (who have paid a full con&s;idera|tion for their debts due from the public) &s;hould partake of the inconveniencies of them.</P>
<P>I therefore humbly propo&s;e, that the fir&s;t thing we do, &s;hould be to &s;et about <HI>rai&s;ing the money;</HI> for <HI>this</HI> will be more acceptable when it comes, whoever is to have it, than <HI>any promi&s;es</HI> we can make.</P>
<P>And in the next place I would propo&s;e, that the <HI>real cre|ditors</HI> &s;hould be <HI>paid fir&s;t,</HI> and the &s;peculators <HI>la&s;t of all,</HI> if it is judged nece&s;&s;ary that they &s;hould ever be paid. I have &s;everal very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rgent rea&s;ons for this propo&s;ition, both moral and political.</P>
<P N="1">1. The real creditors have lain out of their money <HI>longer</HI> than the &s;peculators, and it &s;eems to me very rea&s;on|able and ju&s;t, that the <HI>olde&s;t</HI> debts &s;hould be <HI>fir&s;t</HI> paid.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="283" REF="023972_0290_0FC2B055E05392E0">
2. The &s;peculators who expect <HI>eight-fold their principal,</HI> and 48 <HI>per cent. intere&s;t,</HI> can <HI>better afford</HI> to lie awhile out of their money, than the <HI>real creditors,</HI> who have no pre|ten&s;ions to <HI>any more than barely their principal,</HI> and 6 per cent. intere&s;t.</P>
<P N="3">3. The general e&s;teem of the people, and public con|viction of the ju&s;tice of the demand, is much greater with re&s;pect to the real creditors, than to the &s;peculators; and therefore, when the citizens of the State are told, when the money is to be collected, that it is de&s;igned <HI>for the pay|ment of the real creditors,</HI> the tax will probably be paid <HI>more cheerfully,</HI> and with <HI>le&s;s unea&s;ine&s;s and di&s;turbance,</HI> than may be expected if it was publicly known that it was <HI>to go to the &s;peculators.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. The real creditors are poor, and would be greatly re|lieved by the payment made to them, and be enabled <HI>to go into bu&s;ine&s;s</HI> for their <HI>own</HI> and the <HI>public</HI> advantage. But when the &s;peculators are paid, they will all at once become &s;o <HI>amazingly rich,</HI> that they will probably &s;et up their car|riages, and run into other cour&s;es of <HI>idlene&s;s and plea&s;ures, luxury and di&s;&s;ipation,</HI> which are ever hurtful to the public; and I think it good policy to pay that money <HI>fir&s;t</HI> which is like to do the <HI>mo&s;t</HI> good, and to pay that which is like to do the <HI>mo&s;t hurt, la&s;t of all,</HI> if it mu&s;t be paid at all; for I &s;hall ever think it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound wi&s;dom, if <HI>evils and mi&s;chiefs</HI> cannot be <HI>wholly avoided,</HI> to keep them at <HI>as great a di&s;|tance</HI> as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>On the whole, whether any or all my propo&s;itions can be admitted or not, it does at lea&s;t appear that the real, original <HI>creditors,</HI> and <HI>&s;peculators,</HI> are characters of &s;uch <HI>different</HI> predicament and merit, and their demands on the public, founded on &s;uch <HI>different original con&s;iderations, rea|&s;ons,</HI> and <HI>real earnings,</HI> that the lea&s;t con&s;equence that can be drawn from the whole matter, is a mo&s;t manife&s;t nece&s;|&s;ity that there &s;hould be a <HI>di&s;crimination between them;</HI> that they can, with no propriety, or appearance of ju&s;tice, be con&s;idered on an <HI>equal footing</HI> with each other, or in any manner entitled to the <HI>&s;ame con&s;ideration</HI> and <HI>treatment</HI> from the public.</P>

But I mu&s;t &s;top here a moment, to con&s;ider a capital argu|ment advanced very &s;eriou&s;ly, <HI>"that if all the certificates are not indi&s;criminately paid up to the holders of them, the pub|lic credit will receive &s;uch a wound that we &s;hall never be able to per&s;uade any body in future to loan money, or furni&s;h &s;upplies or &s;ervices on the public faith, let our nece&s;&s;ities be ever &s;o great."</HI> I believe it will be readily admitted, that I have &s;tated this argument in the <HI>&s;ame light</HI> in which it is <HI>urged</HI> by tho&s;e who make u&s;e of it; but I think there is a <HI>delu|&s;ion</HI> in this &s;tatement of the argument, which I will endea|vour to <HI>correct</HI> in the following manner, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>
<P>If, by any <HI>mi&s;management or neglect,</HI> if, by any <HI>deficiency or mi&s;application</HI> of the public monies, it &s;hall &s;o fall out, that the <HI>real, worthy, public creditors</HI> cannot be paid; if matters are <HI>worked about</HI> by any <HI>&s;hifts, arts, combinations, contrivances,</HI> or <HI>deceits,</HI> &s;o that the man who has <HI>loaned mo|ney, furni&s;hed &s;upplies,</HI> or <HI>rendered &s;ervices</HI> to the public in its nece&s;&s;ities, <HI>cannot be paid:</HI> no <HI>pretty, plau&s;ible excu&s;e,</HI> no <HI>fine-&s;pun arguments,</HI> no <HI>force</HI> of words, which really mean <HI>nothing,</HI> no pathetic <HI>addre&s;&s;es</HI> upon perverted facts, can help us out; but the public credit mu&s;t &s;uffer; and if the very men who make the&s;e mi&s;takes, or even &s;ome wi&s;er men, were to rule the roa&s;t in any future time of public di&s;tre&s;s, there is the highe&s;t probability that they would find people <HI>backward to lend their money,</HI> furni&s;h <HI>&s;upplies,</HI> or render <HI>&s;ervices,</HI> on the credit of the public.</P>
<P>On the other hand, if we con&s;ent to pay the &s;peculators the <HI>bare principal,</HI> which they have paid, with the intere&s;t of it, but &s;hall refu&s;e to &s;ecure by the public &s;anction, the <HI>profits of 8 or</HI> 900 per cent. which they demand, the amount of which, in moderate computation, cannot be le&s;s than 2 <HI>or</HI> 3,000,000 <HI>of dollars,</HI> which they never <HI>earn|ed</HI> or <HI>paid</HI> for, nor we ever received any <HI>benefit</HI> or valuable con&s;ideration for; I &s;ay, if we refu&s;e to pay to the &s;pecula|tors the&s;e <HI>enormous profits,</HI> it will &s;o <HI>di&s;courage</HI> them, that it may make them <HI>backward</HI> in venturing again, and &s;o we may be obliged to do <HI>without them</HI> in future times, let us <HI>want them ever &s;o much.</HI></P>
<P>Both the&s;e alternatives are doubtle&s;s very <HI>dreadful,</HI> and
<PB N="285" REF="023972_0292_0FC2B058E13B37A8">
I think there can be no doubt, but we are under an un|avoidable nece&s;&s;ity of incurring <HI>one of them;</HI> but I am in no condition to give my opinion, which would be the mo&s;t <HI>terrible</HI> of the two. So having clearly and fairly &s;tated the facts, I leave the re&s;t to the reader.</P>
<P>But it may be further objected,&mdash;if all this is to be ad|mitted, will it not put it out of the power of the holder of any public &s;ecurity, <HI>to &s;ell it?</HI> Experience will perhaps furni&s;h the be&s;t an&s;wer to this que&s;tion. The <HI>depreciation</HI> of Continental money never <HI>&s;topped</HI> the circulation of it. As long as it retained any value at all, it pa&s;&s;ed quick enough; and would purcha&s;e hard money or any thing el&s;e, as readily as ever, when the exchange was 200 for 1, and when every <HI>hope,</HI> or even <HI>idea,</HI> of its being <HI>redeemed</HI> at nominal value, had <HI>entirely vani&s;hed.</HI></P>
<P>I am told, the price of <HI>&s;tocks</HI> or <HI>public &s;ecurities</HI> in <HI>Eng|land</HI> is now at 55 per cent. <HI>i. e.</HI> reduced by depreciation to near half their nominal value; and not a man in <HI>Eng|land</HI> has the mo&s;t di&s;tant idea that they will <HI>ever be redeem|ed</HI> at their nominal value, yet <HI>they pa&s;s</HI> quick enough <HI>at their exchange,</HI> and any per&s;on who is di&s;po&s;ed <HI>to &s;ell out,</HI> has no difficulty in finding a <HI>purcha&s;er.</HI></P>
<P>It may be further objected, that if the &s;peculators could have known before-hand, that they &s;hould <HI>come off &s;o,</HI> they would not have been concerned in &s;uch &s;peculations at all; but would have laid out their money in <HI>trade, hu&s;ban|dry, manufactures,</HI> or &s;ome <HI>other way.</HI> However <HI>lamentable</HI> this may be, I mu&s;t leave it unan&s;wered.</P>
<P>It may be further objected, that this doctrine will over|&s;et and throw into confu&s;ion the common <HI>rules and laws,</HI> which regulate a&s;&s;ignments of <HI>bonds, bills of exchange, ne|gotiable notes,</HI> &amp;c. which have had the &s;anction of long u&s;age and practice, and have ever been found by experi|ence to be both ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, it will not, for this plain rea&s;on, which would demon&s;trably govern the ca&s;e, if nothing el&s;e could be &s;aid upon it, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> every <HI>law or rule of right,</HI> whether commer|cial, political, moral, or divine, holds <HI>right and ju&s;t, only in its mean;</HI> the moment it is pu&s;hed <HI>out of its mean,</HI> into
<PB N="286" REF="023972_0293_0FC2B0656C609880">
its <HI>extremes,</HI> it lo&s;es the <HI>rea&s;ons</HI> on which it is founded, and becomes <HI>wrong</HI> and <HI>unju&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>We have a law which forbids to make <HI>graven images;</HI> but this prohibits not <HI>&s;tatues</HI> in gardens or <HI>heads</HI> on &s;hips. We have another forbidding to do any <HI>work on the Sabbath;</HI> but this does not make it unlawful to <HI>put out the fire</HI> of a hou&s;e that is burning, or laboring hard to <HI>&s;ave a drowning man,</HI> or to pull <HI>an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">x out of the mire.</HI> We have a law that &s;ays, "thou <HI>&s;halt not kill;</HI>" but this prohibits not the <HI>exe|cution</HI> of a malefactor, or <HI>fighting a battle.</HI> We have an|other that &s;ays, "thou &s;halt not <HI>&s;teal;</HI>" yet a man may <HI>lawfully &s;teal</HI> to <HI>&s;atisfy his hunger.</HI></P>
<P>The only que&s;tion, I conceive, which the &s;ubject admits in this place is, whether the demand of the &s;peculator is an <HI>extreme ca&s;e,</HI> which comes not <HI>within the rea&s;ons,</HI> and of cour&s;e cannot be ju&s;tified or &s;upported by the <HI>rule, of com|mon a&s;&s;ignments?</HI> I contend for the affirmative of this que&s;tion, and for rea&s;on &s;ay the demand is <HI>morally wrong,</HI> becau&s;e it would take an immen&s;e &s;um of money from the community, which mu&s;t be a large proportion of their earnings, and give the &s;ame to the &s;peculators, <HI>without any adequate valuable con&s;ideration,</HI> either paid by the &s;pecula|tors, or received from them by the citizens, contrary to the mo&s;t fundamental law of <HI>commutative ju&s;tice,</HI> which re|quires that a <HI>quid pro quo,</HI> or a valuable <HI>con&s;ideration,</HI> &s;hall always be given <HI>in lieu</HI> of the property transferred. This is the mo&s;t <HI>e&s;&s;ential part of the moral law,</HI> which regards property.</P>
<P>Further, this is not only <HI>morally</HI> wrong, but <HI>politically</HI> &s;o too.</P>
<P N="1">1. Becau&s;e it take<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> an immen&s;e property from tho&s;e who had <HI>earned</HI> it, and would, of cour&s;e, probably make the <HI>be&s;t u&s;e</HI> of it, and places it in the hands of people who have <HI>not earned</HI> it, and who would, of cour&s;e, probably make the <HI>wor&s;t u&s;e</HI> of it. And it is certainly high policy to keep the wealth of the State as far as po&s;&s;ible in the hands of tho&s;e people who will make the <HI>be&s;t u&s;e</HI> of it.</P>
<P N="2">2. Becau&s;e this would <HI>impoveri&s;h the great body of the peo|ple,</HI> who are ever the &s;trength of every nation, in order to

<P N="3">3. Becau&s;e this plan will <HI>retard the increa&s;e</HI> of our <HI>trade</HI> and our <HI>population,</HI> and le&s;&s;en the <HI>value</HI> of our lands.

<P>Our neighbours, e&s;pecially <HI>New-York,</HI> have a va&s;t ex|tent of un&s;ettled lands; they court &s;ettlers with this pow|erful motive, that they have means to pay their debts with|out any burden&s;ome recour&s;e to <HI>taxes</HI> on their <HI>lands, labor,</HI> or <HI>cattle.</HI></P>
<P>The funding plan in que&s;tion, I am told, will require about 300,000 dollars per ann. to defray the intere&s;t only; be&s;ides which, we have &s;undry immen&s;e demands again&s;t the State. The principal debt, the funding of which is now under con&s;ideration, is <HI>about 5,000,000 of dollars,</HI> near half of which I take to be de&s;igned for <HI>clear profit</HI> to the &s;pecula|tors; to be due to them, or from us, it cannot be &s;aid, for they never paid us any thing for it; it mu&s;t then be <HI>ex|ce&s;&s;ive genero&s;ity</HI> to them.</P>
<P>It may do for people to be <HI>generous,</HI> when their <HI>incomes are affluent,</HI> and <HI>ca&s;h, plenty;</HI> but when they are oppre&s;&s;ed with <HI>debt</HI> to &s;uch an amount as to bring their <HI>credit,</HI> and even their <HI>capital,</HI> into danger, in this critical circum&s;tance, the &s;tricte&s;t <HI>economy,</HI> yea, even <HI>clo&s;e par&s;imony,</HI> become very important duties. But in &s;uch a cri&s;is of di&s;tre&s;s and dan|ger, to a&s;&s;ume an immen&s;e, needle&s;s, additional debt, even if a due con&s;ideration was paid for it, would be extreme ill policy; but to do it without <HI>any con&s;ideration</HI> at all, would be the height of <HI>ab&s;urdity and madne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>At all times we ought to be <HI>ju&s;t,</HI> before we are <HI>gene|rous.</HI> But at &s;uch a cri&s;is, a lavi&s;hment that will put it <HI>out of our power to be ju&s;t,</HI> mu&s;t be reprobated as downright wickedne&s;s. And as the <HI>criminality</HI> of all crimes is e&s;ti|mated

by the <HI>damage</HI> they do, that <HI>conduct in a ruler,</HI> which de&s;troys the <HI>credit</HI> of a State, and even puts it out of the power of it to be <HI>ju&s;t,</HI> and of cour&s;e de&s;troys the <HI>rights</HI> of thou&s;ands of its mo&s;t meritorious citizens, ought to be branded, as the mo&s;t cen&s;urable of <HI>any crime</HI> which can af|fect human <HI>property, character, and honor.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. This plan is impolitic, becau&s;e it will convey the mo|ney collected from the people to <HI>a great di&s;tance</HI> from the places where it was collected, and of cour&s;e the people who paid it, will have <HI>little or no benefit</HI> from its future cir|culation. If the &s;ame monies were to be paid (as they ought to be) to the <HI>real creditors, i. e.</HI> the &s;oldiers and others, who furni&s;hed monies, &s;upplies, &amp;c. who are &s;cat|tered over the whole State, and are to be found in every part of it; I &s;ay, if the monies collected from the people were to be paid to tho&s;e, it would be <HI>diffu&s;ed over the whole State,</HI> and every per&s;on who paid the tax to rai&s;e the&s;e mo|nies, would have a chance of <HI>taking benefit of its cir|culation.</HI></P>
<P>But the ca&s;e will be widely different, when it &s;hall be paid to the &s;peculators; mo&s;t of them live in the city, and the few who re&s;ide in the country, when they come to re|ceive their immen&s;e fortunes, will immediately come to the city, with all their money; the country will be no proper place to parade in; they will find nobody there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">it to rank with; and that is not all; but when they clatter along in their carriages, they may chance to hear &s;omebody &s;ay, <Q>there goes a &s;peculator or &s;tock-jobber, who revels in the &s;poils of his country.</Q></P>
<P>In &s;hort, this will not do at all; they mu&s;t move into the city, where they can find people of their own cla&s;s to a&s;|&s;ociate with.</P>
<P>And this is not the wor&s;t of it; the &s;peculators, I &s;up|po&s;e, mu&s;t <HI>nominally belong to this State,</HI> but doubt not but they are in company, and &s;hare profits with many who <HI>live out of it,</HI> and con&s;equently convey their wealth out of the State.</P>
<P>And this is not the wor&s;t of it, but I conceive that ma|ny of them, tho' they re&s;ide in this State, are not na|tives

<P>It is here to be noted in a manner which I think de&s;erves great attention, that however <HI>dirty, ragged, poor,</HI> and <HI>de&s;|picable</HI> an <HI>injured people</HI> may appear, they always have one <HI>&s;pecies of revenge</HI> left to them, which they rarely fail to make the mo&s;t of, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the <HI>power and privilege of cur&s;ing</HI> their oppre&s;&s;ors; they cur&s;e them in the <HI>&s;treets,</HI> they pro|pagate their cur&s;es by their fire-&s;ides to their <HI>children,</HI> who are not commonly apt to have much defect of memo|ry, and they <HI>mix</HI> their execrations with their <HI>prayers to Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>It is &s;aid that the <HI>cur&s;e cau&s;ele&s;s will not come;</HI> but I be|lieve few States or individuals have rea&s;on to make them|&s;elves very ea&s;y <HI>under tho&s;e cur&s;es which are not cau&s;ele&s;s.</HI> There is mo&s;t certainly a <HI>Providence</HI> which governs the world, which pays the utmo&s;t attention to <HI>right</HI> and <HI>wrong,</HI> without the lea&s;t re&s;pect imaginable to the <HI>lace</HI> or <HI>rags</HI> of the &s;uitors.</P>
<P>Many more arguments might be adduced, but I deem the above fully &s;ufficient, to prove that the plan in que&s;ti|on is in its nature <HI>immoral</HI> and <HI>di&s;hone&s;t;</HI> and, in a <HI>politi|cal</HI> view, extremely <HI>injurious</HI> to the State, and I might al|mo&s;t add, <HI>fatally ruinous;</HI> and therefore is demon&s;trated to be <HI>an extreme ca&s;e,</HI> not at all <HI>within the rea&s;ons</HI> of, and of cour&s;e <HI>not ju&s;tifiable</HI> by, the common <HI>law or rule of a&s;&s;ign|ments</HI> which, by long u&s;e, has been found to be both <HI>mo|rally</HI> and <HI>politically good</HI> and u&s;eful.</P>
<P>The <HI>Committee of Public Creditors,</HI> in their la&s;t petition to the A&s;&s;embly, have introduced one propo&s;ition, which plea&s;es me very much, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <Q><HI>Nothing that is morally</HI> WRONG <HI>can ever be politically</HI> RIGHT.</Q> I could wi&s;h

this was written in <HI>letters of gold</HI> in the fronti&s;piece of all our <HI>chambers of public council;</HI> and, what is more, might be engraved on the <HI>hearts</HI> of all our public men, as a prac|tical principle <HI>too &s;acred</HI> to yield to any <HI>views of intere&s;t,</HI> however <HI>gaudily dre&s;&s;ed,</HI> or <HI>finely colored:</HI> and, by way of giving it my little mite of improvement and &s;upport, I beg leave to add, that nothing which is both <HI>morally</HI> and <HI>politi|cally wrong,</HI> can ever be <HI>right</HI> in any &s;en&s;e what&s;oever.</P>
<P>I have one argument again&s;t &s;atisfying the demands of the &s;peculators, which I have not marked under either mo|ral or political arguments, becau&s;e it appears to me &s;trong|ly to partake of both, and therefore ought to be mentioned by it&s;elf. It is this, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>it gives public &s;anction,</HI> &s;upport, and even a kind of <HI>dignity,</HI> to a &s;ort of &s;peculation, which, if not wicked in it&s;elf, is of a nature very ruinous to the public, as it affords <HI>enormous profits without any earnings,</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> eight-fold the principal, and 48 per cent. intere&s;t, which (were they to be freed from <HI>di&s;grace and danger,</HI> and to be made <HI>reputable</HI> and &s;afe by the <HI>&s;anction and &s;upport</HI> of the Legi&s;lature) would be enough to induce <HI>bad men</HI> of all profe&s;&s;ions to <HI>withdraw their &s;tock in bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI> from their u&s;ual occupations, and <HI>ve&s;t</HI> it in &s;uch &s;peculations of high <HI>profit and honor.</HI></P>
<P>In my opinion, nothing &s;carcely can be wor&s;e than <HI>public laws or in&s;titutions,</HI> which tend to draw people from the <HI>hone&s;t and painful</HI> method of <HI>earning</HI> fortunes, and to en|courage them to pur&s;ue <HI>chimerical ways</HI> and <HI>means</HI> of ob|taining <HI>wealth</HI> by <HI>&s;leight of hand, without any earnings at all.</HI></P>
<P>But were the&s;e &s;peculators to gamble on <HI>each other's pur&s;es</HI> only, I &s;hould think le&s;s of it; but it becomes pub|licly ruinous, when the <HI>public</HI> are to pay the <HI>lo&s;ings.</HI></P>
<P>The fatal experience of <HI>Europe</HI> might, methinks, be a warning to us.

But our &s;peculators go far beyond this; they give 2<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> in the pound, which is 8 for 1. But it is no wonder that our &s;peculators &s;hould exceed tho&s;e of the mo&s;t ingenious nation in <HI>Europe,</HI> &s;ince the <HI>American genius</HI> &s;ets up to <HI>outdo all the world</HI> in every thing.</P>
<P>A cri&s;is of <HI>public di&s;tre&s;s</HI> is the proper time for this kind of vermin to &s;warm, like <HI>flies</HI> about a <HI>&s;ore,</HI> or <HI>crows</HI> round a <HI>carca&s;s,</HI> not with any de&s;ign to <HI>heal the &s;ore,</HI> or <HI>re&s;tore life,</HI> but to <HI>feed them&s;elves.</HI> This I admit to be a principle natural enough; but however excu&s;able it may be in it|&s;elf for the&s;e, like all other noxious animals, to pur&s;ue the means of their own pre&s;ervation, yet I cannot think they are entitled to the <HI>gratitude,</HI> or <HI>&s;upport,</HI> or <HI>rewards,</HI> of the public.</P>
<P>I beg the reader to note here very particularly, that I do not mean by any thing I write, to oppo&s;e any practicable and wi&s;e plan of funding or paying the <HI>real public debts;</HI> all I object to is, <HI>funding or paying the profits of the &s;pecula|tors.</HI></P>
<P>But however our public coun&s;els may &s;ettle this que&s;tion, and whatever is to be done with our public monies, when we get them, I here beg my readers' attention a little, to the <HI>ways and means</HI> of rai&s;ing them.</P>
<P N="1">1. In the fir&s;t place, <HI>I do object as &s;trongly as I am able, to laying any con&s;iderable tax on polls and e&s;tates.</HI> This is tax|ing the labor, cattle, and lands of our people, which are the <HI>embryo,</HI> the <HI>fir&s;t principles,</HI> the very <HI>&s;eed,</HI> the <HI>raw ma|terials</HI> of our wealth; and of cour&s;e ought to be mo&s;t carefully and tenderly <HI>nur&s;ed, cultivated,</HI> and <HI>encouraged;</HI> but by no means to be <HI>burdened</HI> and <HI>di&s;couraged.</HI></P>
<P>We have <HI>imported luxuries</HI> enough, which are hurtful to the public; the nece&s;&s;ary re&s;traints of which <HI>require a tax</HI> &s;ufficiently large for the public u&s;e. It would be better for
<PB N="292" REF="023972_0299_0FC2A7BD454E1FB0">
our people to pay a tax of a dollar per gallon on rum and wines, 50 per cent. on &s;ilks, &amp;c. &amp;c. than to &s;uffer their <HI>labor</HI> and <HI>lands</HI> to be taxed. But if this, with our u&s;ual taxes on trade, &amp;c. is not &s;ufficient, I would rather tax our <HI>exported goods</HI> than our <HI>labor</HI> and <HI>lands;</HI> becau&s;e I think it manife&s;tly better to tax our <HI>fini&s;hed goods,</HI> than our <HI>raw materials.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides, our pa&s;t experience has &s;ufficiently taught us, that the collection of any con&s;iderable tax on polls and e&s;tates is impracticable; the va&s;t arrears of mo&s;t of our counties are a full proof of this; and to make our <HI>trea&s;ury</HI> depend on revenues of <HI>uncertain product,</HI> is a &s;ure way to &s;ubject our finance to <HI>con&s;tant di&s;appointment,</HI> and of cour&s;e to keep our <HI>public credit</HI> in a perpetual &s;tate of <HI>depre&s;&s;ion,</HI> and &s;candalous, as well as ruinous, <HI>deficiency.</HI> But I will not dwell longer here on this &s;ubject, having treated it more largely in my Sixth E&s;&s;ay on Free Trade and Fi|nance, to which I refer the reader, if he de&s;ires to hear any more about it. <HI>[See p. 230.]</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>I object mo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly to i&s;&s;uing paper money, in our pre|&s;ent circum&s;tances,</HI> for the following rea&s;ons:</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>We have already a full &s;ufficiency of circulating ca&s;h.</HI> The labor of our people, and all the great &s;taple commodi|ties of our country, produced by it, will and do bring not only immediate <HI>ca&s;h,</HI> but a <HI>high price;</HI> and it is not po&s;&s;i|ble that money &s;hould be <HI>too &s;carce</HI> in any country, where the <HI>labor</HI> and <HI>produce</HI> of it have <HI>quick &s;ale, good price,</HI> and command immediate <HI>ca&s;h;</HI> whil&s;t this is the ca&s;e, every natural and nece&s;&s;ary <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nd</HI> and <HI>u&s;e</HI> of ca&s;h is fully an&s;wered and &s;atisfied; and, of cour&s;e, if any body in &s;uch ca&s;e wants money, the want mu&s;t ari&s;e, not from any <HI>&s;carcity of ca&s;h,</HI> but from a want of &s;omething that will <HI>purcha&s;e it, i. e.</HI> from poverty; which the introduction of an addition|al quantity of circulating ca&s;h will by no means remove, but mu&s;t increa&s;e, becau&s;e it will directly tend to le&s;&s;en indu&s;try, and introduce luxury.</P>
<P>It is no objection to this, that <HI>European</HI> and <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> goods will not bring ready ca&s;h; it is well known that the market is greatly glutted with tho&s;e articles; and when a
<PB N="293" REF="023972_0300_0FC2A7CD00125B38">
market is <HI>over&s;tocked with any articles,</HI> they will not bring <HI>quick</HI> &s;ale and <HI>ready</HI> ca&s;h, let money be ever &s;o plenty.</P>
<P N="2">2. Our ca&s;h for a year pa&s;t has been not only fully &s;uf|ficient for the purpo&s;es of our trade, <HI>but has been in a very &s;ettled, &s;teady &s;tate, with very little fluctuation or variation in its value.</HI> This appears from the <HI>&s;ettled prices</HI> which our &s;taple commodities have born thro' the la&s;t year. The &s;ame thing appears from the <HI>negotiations of the Bank;</HI> from which it is manife&s;t, that the &s;tate and quantity of hard ca&s;h is nearly the &s;ame with us now as it was a year ago; this proves that the quantity of circulating ca&s;h is &s;uffici|ent; for were it not &s;o, it would undulate and vary; for ca&s;h, like water, will always flow from the <HI>higher</HI> to the <HI>lower</HI> &s;urface, and will never become <HI>fixed and &s;teady</HI> till the true <HI>equilibrium</HI> is obtained.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>It is admitted by every body, that ca&s;h was plenty enough before the war; but it is plain we have now much more of it than we had then;</HI> becau&s;e the price of labor and the pro|duce of the country are much higher now than they were then. On an average, about 40 or 50 per cent. more can now be obtained for labor and country produce, than their current price was in 1774.</P>
<P>It is no objection to this, that it is more difficult to <HI>bor|row money on intere&s;t now</HI> than it was <HI>then;</HI> it is a want of public and private <HI>faith,</HI> and <HI>di&s;tru&s;t</HI> of all &s;ecurity, and not a <HI>&s;carcity</HI> of ca&s;h, which makes the difficulty. Be&s;ides this, another cau&s;e may be a&s;&s;igned, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> our monied men who u&s;ed to di&s;po&s;e of their money in that way, have, at lea&s;t many of them, <HI>lo&s;t their money,</HI> loaned on either pub|lic or private &s;ecurities, by the <HI>defect of tho&s;e &s;ecurities,</HI> and of cour&s;e the lenders of money are in this way reduced to a <HI>fewer</HI> number, whil&s;t at the &s;ame time, the &s;ame cau&s;e <HI>adds to the number</HI> of tho&s;e who have occa&s;ion to <HI>bor|row;</HI> each of which naturally increa&s;es the difficulty of borrowing.</P>
<P>Striking paper money will <HI>le&s;&s;en</HI> none of the&s;e difficulties, but will <HI>increa&s;e</HI> them all; as it is evident that it will much le&s;&s;en all <HI>confidence in any &s;ecurities</HI> of long continu|ance,
<PB N="294" REF="023972_0301_0FC2A7CE31D1BD08">
and, in every view, <HI>dimini&s;h</HI> the number of lenders of money.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Making large and &s;udden additions (of either pa|per or hard money) to our circulating ca&s;h, will not increa&s;e our wealth:</HI> its effect will be an <HI>increa&s;e of the price</HI> of all articles of traffic, <HI>i. e.</HI> it will de&s;troy the <HI>&s;teady value</HI> of our money, by le&s;&s;ening its worth in an <HI>inver&s;e ratio</HI> of the increa&s;e of its quantity, and &s;o, without any benefit, will introduce the ruinous mi&s;chiefs of a fluctuating currency, <HI>from which, good Lord, deliver us!</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>I do not apprehend that we have the lea&s;t chance of &s;up|porting the credit of paper money, if it &s;hould be i&s;&s;ued;</HI> and to expo&s;e our public credit to further <HI>di&s;grace</HI> and <HI>in&s;ult,</HI> and to wa&s;te the public wealth in further <HI>&s;tupid, ab&s;urd,</HI> and <HI>iniquitous appreciations</HI> of depreciated paper, appears to me the height of political frenzy. The pre&s;&s;ure of a va&s;t public debt, the low &s;tate of the public credit, the univer|&s;al diffidence in that &s;ort of money which prevails among the people of all ranks, and the dreadful apprehen&s;ions of its con&s;equences, which are expre&s;&s;ed <HI>by the Bank,</HI> and by all <HI>our merchants</HI> (who are certainly the be&s;t judges of the matter) I &s;ay, all the&s;e put together appear to me to de&s;troy every degree of probability of &s;upporting the credit of any additional paper currency.</P>
<P>And I cannot &s;uppo&s;e any body di&s;tracted enough to think it <HI>proper to i&s;&s;ue it,</HI> if every idea of the probability of <HI>&s;upporting its credit</HI> mu&s;t be given up. But I am apt to con|jecture, that if our &s;peculators fail in their &s;cheme of get|ting their <HI>immen&s;e profits funded,</HI> the demand for <HI>that money</HI> will be greatly le&s;&s;ened, and &s;o, perhaps, the <HI>zeal</HI> for &s;trik|ing paper may <HI>cool away,</HI> and, of cour&s;e, any further ar|guments again&s;t it, may not be nece&s;&s;ary. But if nothing can hinder the attempt, I am of opinion it mu&s;t die in the birth.&mdash;For,</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>I do not believe it po&s;&s;ible to u&s;her paper money into gene|ral currency, either with or without a tender-act.</HI> Making it <HI>a tender</HI> is indeed too &s;hocking to be admitted by any &s;ober man that I have heard of; and <HI>without it,</HI> it mu&s;t, I think,
<PB N="295" REF="023972_0302_0FC2A7CF4F4706A8">
have the &s;ame effect, and &s;hare the &s;ame fate, as the other paper which has recently gone before it.</P>
<P>But after all, if it &s;hould gain a <HI>general currency,</HI> and a <HI>credit</HI> but <HI>little inferior</HI> to hard money, the effect, I think, mu&s;t plainly and evidently be, <HI>that it will &s;oon drive all the hard money out of the country, or at lea&s;t out of circulation,</HI> as it will certainly be either hoarded or purcha&s;ed up for ex|portation; and then we &s;hall have nothing before us, but to increa&s;e the <HI>quantity</HI> of our paper, and &s;upply the <HI>defici|ency</HI> of its <HI>value</HI> by <HI>additions</HI> to its <HI>quantity,</HI> and make the mo&s;t of it, Continental like, as long as we can make it pa&s;s at all.</P>
<P N="7">7. With re&s;pect to the plan of opening a <HI>Loan-Office,</HI> and &s;triking a &s;um of paper money to put into it, <HI>to be loan|ed out on private &s;ecurity</HI> to &s;uch per&s;ons as may want to borrow, I have to ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That all the objections which lie again&s;t &s;triking paper money at all, lie with equal weight again&s;t &s;triking any for this particular purpo&s;e.</HI></P>

<HI>make it operate</HI> in a way of <HI>effectual, impartial,</HI> and <HI>general</HI> utility.</P>
<P>Upon the whole matter, the great principle I go upon with re&s;pect to public &s;ecurities, is this, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>that all bills i&s;&s;ued on the public credit, of every &s;ort, under whatever deno|mination they may appear, whether of certificates, paper mo|ney, annuities, &amp;c. &amp;c. take their value, not from the</HI> &s;ums &s;pecified in the face <HI>of them, but from the</HI> price <HI>or</HI> exchange <HI>at which they generally pa&s;s in market, and, of cour&s;e, when they are redeemed by the public, it ought to be either at their original value, or at that price or exchange at which they ge|nerally pa&s;s at the time of redemption,</HI> EXCEPTING ONLY <HI>&s;uch &s;ecurities as are in the hands of the original holder, and have never been alienated.</HI> Such &s;ecurities are <HI>evidences of</HI> full con&s;ideration <HI>paid, and, of cour&s;e, of a</HI> full debt <HI>due to &s;uch holder: but &s;ecurities in the hands of a purcha&s;er cannot be</HI> &s;uch evidence.</P>
<P>When public &s;ecurities gain a currency, or become ob|jects of traffic, and depreciate in the hands of the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;or, <HI>he doubtle&s;s &s;u&s;tains lo&s;s,</HI> and is really <HI>injured;</HI> and when the depreciation is great, &s;ay 8 for 1, or 200 for 1 (bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> which we have &s;een) the mi&s;chief becomes <HI>very hea|vy,</HI> and in its nature lies in the <HI>lo&s;s which the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of the &s;ecurities &s;u&s;tained, by their depreciation whil&s;t they were in his hands:</HI></P>
<P>Hence it appears clearly enough <HI>where the mi&s;chief</HI> lies, and, of cour&s;e, it is ea&s;y to &s;ee what mu&s;t be the <HI>nature</HI> of the remedy it requires, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>&s;uch a remedy as will make up the lo&s;&s;es which every one has &s;u&s;tained by the depreciation of the public &s;ecurities whil&s;t in their hands.</HI> This is manife&s;tly impracticable, and perhaps the utmo&s;t power of human in|vention cannot hit on any plan which will do this; what then ought the public to do? I an&s;wer, the &s;ame which any private man mu&s;t do, who knows that he has had a <HI>valuable con&s;ideration</HI> for money, and <HI>hone&s;tly owes</HI> it, but <HI>knows not to whom</HI> it is due, or cannot <HI>find his creditor.</HI></P>
<P>From this view of the matter it appears very plain, that <HI>appreciating</HI> the &s;ecurities, and redeeming them at <HI>full va|lue,</HI> gives not the <HI>lea&s;t remedy</HI> to the <HI>&s;ufferers by the deprecia|tion,</HI>
<PB N="297" REF="023972_0304_0FC2A7D6AA9A3830">
but is an <HI>additional injury</HI> to them; becau&s;e the &s;ecu|rities, <HI>at the time of redemption, will not be in the</HI> &s;ame <HI>hands in which they depreciated,</HI> and, of cour&s;e, the &s;ufferers will find <HI>them&s;elves taxed</HI> to make up the money, which <HI>they lo&s;t</HI> by the depreciation, that it may be paid to the pre&s;ent holders of the &s;ecurities, who <HI>never lo&s;t</HI> any thing. But if any one wi&s;hes to &s;ee this &s;ubject further di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, I refer him to my <HI>Fifth E&s;&s;ay on Free Trade and Finance,</HI> where this matter is fully con&s;idered, with re&s;pect to Continental money. [<HI>See p.</HI> 97.]</P>
<P>I will conclude here by ob&s;erving, that not one argu|ment can be adduced for redeeming the public &s;ecurities at full value, which will not apply to the <HI>Continental</HI> and <HI>old State money,</HI> and prove that both ought to be redeemed at <HI>full nominal value.</HI></P>
<P>I take it that the public accounts are nearly all adju&s;ted, and the public creditors have received certificates or public &s;ecurities for their re&s;pective balances. But as tho&s;e &s;ecu|rities are mo&s;tly Continental, it will lie with <HI>Congre&s;s,</HI> and not with any <HI>particular State,</HI> to pre&s;cribe the time, mode, and value of their redemption.</P>
<P>In the mean time, I think we may do much for the pre|&s;ent relief of our own di&s;tre&s;&s;ed citizens, who &s;uffer greatly by the <HI>delays</HI> of Continental payment; and I e&s;teem the at|tempts of <HI>our A&s;&s;embly</HI> very <HI>laudable</HI> in their <HI>principle.</HI> What I complain of is an <HI>error</HI> in the <HI>application.</HI> It is certainly very good in them to &s;train every nerve to rai&s;e money for the <HI>relief of our widows, orphans, &s;oldiers,</HI> and <HI>other wor|thy and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed public creditors;</HI> but I think it <HI>a mi&s;take</HI> to plan the matter &s;o, that when the money is rai&s;ed, it <HI>&s;hall not be applied</HI> to the relief of tho&s;e <HI>worthy, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed citizens,</HI> but &s;hall go, at lea&s;t a very con&s;iderable part of it, to a <HI>parcel of &s;peculators,</HI> who neither ever <HI>earned</HI> it, nor are in any <HI>di&s;tre&s;s</HI> for want of it; for they are generally rich, and can command plenty of ca&s;h.</P>
<P>With the good leave of the public, I will &s;um up the matter, and humbly offer &s;ome propo&s;itions, which appear to me worthy of con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>I. <HI>I propo&s;e to &s;et about rai&s;ing all the money we can, not by a</HI> tax on polls and e&s;tates, <HI>which will be very burden&s;ome
<PB N="298" REF="023972_0305_0FC2A7DE82C551F0">
to our people, hurtful to the capital intere&s;t of the State, and of very</HI> uncertain product; <HI>but by continuing our pre&s;ent</HI> duties on trade, <HI>with &s;uch further</HI> additional duties on LUXU|RIES, <HI>as will be nece&s;&s;ary to</HI> re&s;train the exce&s;&s;ive <HI>u&s;e of them:</HI> and this, I conceive, will require duties <HI>&s;o high,</HI> as will be &s;ufficient for the <HI>exigencies</HI> of the State, and will be of <HI>certain product.</HI></P>
<P>II. <HI>I propo&s;e to pay all the intere&s;t which is now due to the inhabitants of this State, on all &s;uch public &s;ecurities as are in the hands of the</HI> original holders, <HI>and have</HI> not been alienat|ed (to be a&s;certained by <HI>affidavit</HI> or any <HI>other</HI> &s;ufficient proof) and al&s;o to <HI>&s;top payment</HI> of all intere&s;t on any certifi|cates which are <HI>not in the hands of the original holders;</HI> for I do not know that among citizens of equal merit, we can with ju&s;tice make fi&s;h of one, and fle&s;h of another.</P>
<P>III. <HI>I propo&s;e that commi&s;&s;ioners be appointed to</HI> purcha&s;e up <HI>&s;uch public &s;ecurities as were originally given to the citizens of this State, but have</HI> been alienated <HI>by the original holders, and are now in currency as objects of traffic or exchange: to pur|cha&s;e &s;uch &s;ecurities, I &s;ay, at the</HI> current exchange, <HI>or as low as they can be bought.</HI> It is certainly as right for <HI>the State</HI> to buy up the&s;e &s;ecurities, which are become a com|mon object of traffic, as it is for <HI>any individual.</HI> Two great advantages will re&s;ult from this:</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The pre&s;ent holders will have the value of them paid in money:</HI> and,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The State will have them to produce to Congre&s;s, when|ever our quota &s;hall be demanded for the redemption of them;</HI> for the &s;ecurities them&s;elves will doubtle&s;s be accepted as good payment of our quota, both of principal and intere&s;t; and it will then be indifferent to us <HI>at what exchange,</HI> or in <HI>what manner</HI> or <HI>time,</HI> Congre&s;s may direct their redemp|tion.</P>
<P>IV. <HI>I propo&s;e that all tho&s;e original holders of public &s;ecuri|ties, who have alienated them, &s;hall be debited on the public books, with the certificates they received, at the</HI> value <HI>(and no more) at which they could be</HI> &s;old at the time they received <HI>them, or the</HI> time of their date, <HI>and that the re&s;idue of their balance may be paid, together with the principal of the certifi|cates,</HI>
<PB N="299" REF="023972_0306_0FC2A7DFD063B978">
<HI>which are now in the hands of the original holders, and have not been alienated.</HI> I &s;ay, that both the&s;e <HI>be paid as &s;oon as money &s;ufficient can be rai&s;ed by the State.</HI></P>
<P>It will require, I know, a heavy &s;um of money to do this, but we &s;hall have this &s;atisfaction to animate our ex|ertions, that we are doing <HI>an act of ju&s;tice in favor of tho&s;e to whom the money is ju&s;tly due,</HI> and &s;hall have the advan|tage of paying it to people who are &s;cattered thro' the State, and will immediately circulate the money among our citizens, in every part of the State, which, if the ju&s;tice was equal, will be much <HI>preferable to paying the &s;ame money</HI> to people who would carry it all <HI>away to di&s;tant parts,</HI> from whence it would have little chance of returning into circu|lation, to the places where it was collected.</P>
<P>V. As the pre&s;&s;ures of the State are very heavy, I think we ought to make all the &s;avings we can; I therefore pro|po&s;e <HI>to le&s;&s;en the Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly, by taking away two-thirds of the members, and limiting the &s;e&s;&s;ions of the Council</HI> to the A&s;&s;embly's &s;e&s;&s;ions, unle&s;s the Pre&s;ident &s;hould, on emer|gent occa&s;ions, &s;ummon them. I think <HI>one-third</HI> of our A&s;&s;embly would do the bu&s;ine&s;s much <HI>better</HI> than all of them; and the Pre&s;ident, with a good Secretary, would be &s;ufficient for the common and u&s;ual bu&s;ine&s;s of the Council. I know of no advantage ari&s;ing from <HI>over-nu|merous Legi&s;latures,</HI> or <HI>Councils</HI> that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">it too long. The ex|tremes of democratical government tend to anarchy, or de&s;poti&s;m, or ruin.</P>
<P>An idle, u&s;ele&s;s, or corrupt member is le&s;s noticed and ea&s;ier lo&s;t in the crowd, in a <HI>large</HI> A&s;&s;embly, than in a <HI>&s;mall</HI> one. <HI>Virtue and merit</HI> are, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, <HI>le&s;s</HI> con&s;picuous in a large than &s;mall A&s;&s;embly; <HI>cabals, party-&s;chemes,</HI> and <HI>intere&s;ted plans,</HI> are ea&s;ier formed in a <HI>large</HI> than in a <HI>&s;mall</HI> hou&s;e, and the <HI>guilt</HI> or <HI>folly</HI> of an indivi|dual is more ea&s;ily &s;heltered or concealed in <HI>great</HI> than in <HI>&s;mall</HI> numbers.</P>
<P>For when A&s;&s;emblies are large, the bu&s;ine&s;s is mo&s;t com|monly done by a few, under the umbrage of the whole; the major part are not commonly <HI>in the &s;ecret.</HI> The <HI>Ame|rican Congre&s;s</HI> rarely con&s;i&s;ts of more than thirty members
<PB N="300" REF="023972_0307_0FC2A7E49D8A8BB8">
pre&s;ent, yet no complaint has been made that their num|ber is too &s;mall. The <HI>Briti&s;h Hou&s;e of Commons</HI> con&s;i&s;ts of more than five hundred members, not very famous for gra|vity, wi&s;dom, or order. Their proceedings are commonly directed by the <HI>Premier,</HI> and a few <HI>leading members;</HI> yet if you a&s;k Lord <HI>North,</HI> why he pu&s;hed the <HI>American</HI> war, he will tell you with great compo&s;ure, that it was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>his war, but the war of the Parliament.</HI></P>
<P>When <HI>more people</HI> are employed about any bu&s;ine&s;s than are nece&s;&s;ary to do it, the con&s;equence has ever been found to be, that the bu&s;ine&s;s is not <HI>done &s;o well,</HI> is clogged with <HI>more delays,</HI> is le&s;s <HI>con&s;i&s;tent</HI> in its &s;everal parts, and not &s;o <HI>well methodized.</HI> The people who are intere&s;ted in the bu|&s;ine&s;s, and have occa&s;ion to attend upon it, are not &s;o <HI>well-&s;erved,</HI> and a <HI>greater expen&s;e</HI> is incurred, than would hap|pen, if people <HI>ju&s;t enough</HI> for the bu&s;ine&s;s, and <HI>no more,</HI> had been employed.</P>
<P>This, one would think, was grounded on natural fitne&s;s; for we find it holds true in all human affairs, from a hou&s;e too full of <HI>&s;ervants,</HI> a field with too many <HI>reapers,</HI> a town-meeting of too many <HI>people,</HI> a kitchen with too many <HI>cooks,</HI> a committee of too many <HI>members,</HI> a church with too ma|ny <HI>deacons</HI> or too large a ve&s;try, a court with too many <HI>judges,</HI> and &s;o on, up to an a&s;&s;embly of the fir&s;t dignity, with too many <HI>repre&s;entatives.</HI></P>
<P>Now to admit any principle or circum&s;tance into our grave&s;t and mo&s;t important councils, which has ever been found hurtful in all ca&s;es where it has been adopted, is highly imprudent and dangerous, and tends to ruin. The fatal experience of many great nations proves this in a manner very forcible and convincing.</P>
<P><HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Greece</HI> lo&s;t their liberties by over-numerous Se|nates, &amp;c. and <HI>Poland</HI> is now in de&s;olation from the &s;ame cau&s;e; their <HI>Po&s;polite,</HI> which was in&s;tituted for the great defence of their nation, and their <HI>liberum veto,</HI> which they hugged with enthu&s;ia&s;m, as the <HI>&s;tandard</HI> of their liberty, together with their <HI>over-numerous Diets,</HI> have completely ruined them. But whether the&s;e ob&s;ervations are proper

or not, we &s;hall, by this propo&s;ition, at lea&s;t &s;ave a <HI>va&s;t ex|pen&s;e,</HI> at a time when the utmo&s;t economy is nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>VI. At all times, but e&s;pecially i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> times of public pre&s;|&s;ure, the <HI>peace and quiet</HI> of the State &s;hould be con&s;ulted, and the general <HI>confidence</HI> of the people in the government &s;hould be as far as po&s;&s;ible <HI>&s;ecured,</HI> it order to its firm e&s;ta|bli&s;hment, and the great <HI>principles</HI> of our civil policy &s;hould be <HI>&s;trictly regarded.</HI> I therefore humbly propo&s;e <HI>the repeal of the te&s;t-act;</HI> for we can no how expect the internal peace and quiet of our people, and their confidence in our go|vernment, &s;o long as we exclude <HI>one-third</HI> our citizens from any &s;hare in it.</P>
<P>Nor can we any how call our civil policy a government <HI>of the people,</HI> or reap the advantage of &s;uch a government, as long as &s;o <HI>large a proportion</HI> of our citizens (if reckoned by numbers, influence, wi&s;dom, or e&s;tate) are <HI>&s;hut out</HI> and <HI>disfranchi&s;ed.</HI> We need the <HI>coun&s;els</HI> as well as the <HI>wealth</HI> of <HI>all</HI> our people, and our con&s;titution gives <HI>equal right,</HI> as well as pre&s;cribes <HI>equal duty,</HI> to them all.</P>
<P><HI>That the major mu&s;t rule the minor,</HI> is undoubtedly a maxim e&s;&s;ential to a democratical or republican govern|ment; but it is equally manife&s;t, that the <HI>extremes</HI> of this maxim will de&s;troy the very <HI>nature,</HI> as well as <HI>u&s;es,</HI> of &s;uch governments. For if <HI>two-thirds</HI> can disfranchi&s;e the <HI>minor</HI> third, a <HI>majority</HI> of the remaining two-thirds may disfran|chi&s;e the <HI>minority</HI> of them, and &s;o on <HI>toties quoties,</HI> till there will be but <HI>two</HI> left undisfranchi&s;ed, to govern the whole; which, I &s;uppo&s;e, every body will allow to be &s;omewhat <HI>wor&s;e</HI> than to have <HI>but one</HI> &s;overeign de&s;pot; for the two might quarrel, and each form his party, and &s;o the State might be involved in a civil war, which could not happen, if there was but <HI>one</HI> de&s;pot, and nobody el&s;e left capable of forming a party.</P>
<P>It is doubtle&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to adopt good maxims of govern|ment, but it is equally nece&s;&s;ary to exerci&s;e &s;ome <HI>prudence and di&s;cretion</HI> in the u&s;e of them; for we may be ruined by the <HI>extremes</HI> of tho&s;e very maxims, which, in their <HI>mean,</HI> are very &s;alutary and u&s;eful.</P>

<P>And the very money which is <HI>granted and paid</HI> by the country, for the <HI>ju&s;t recompen&s;e</HI> of the&s;e <HI>worthy and de&s;erv|ing patriots,</HI> is, by a &s;trange <HI>fatality</HI> of events, <HI>ab&s;urdity</HI> of rea&s;oning, and <HI>perver&s;ion</HI> of coun&s;el and right, I &s;ay, this money is propo&s;ed by &s;ome to be diverted from, and <HI>never paid to,</HI> them; but to be given to another cla&s;s of <HI>citizens and foreigners,</HI> who do not pretend <HI>to any merit of their own,</HI> or to have <HI>earned any of the money,</HI> but who&s;e claim and de|mand is founded wholly on the <HI>merit and earnings</HI> of the&s;e worthy citizens, who are, by the very plan, <HI>to lo&s;e it all, and get none of it.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>worthy patriots I allude to, are tho&s;e who, during the war,</HI> when our country was overwhelmed with infinite di&s;tre&s;s and danger, <HI>rendered their &s;ervices, &s;upplies, and mo|ney in its defence,</HI> but who, on the adju&s;tment of their ac|counts, <HI>could not be paid,</HI> by rea&s;on of the deficiency of the public finances of the States, and, therefore, were <HI>obliged to accept</HI> certificates of the balances <HI>due</HI> to them, with pro|mi&s;es of intere&s;t and payment in future time.</P>
<P>The&s;e certificates were made <HI>payable to the bearer,</HI> and of cour&s;e were negotiable, and were worth about 2<HI>s.</HI> or 2<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> in the pound, their value being e&s;timated by the current or <HI>common price,</HI> at which they were generally <HI>bought</HI> and <HI>&s;old</HI> in the public market; for the value of certificates, as well as of every thing el&s;e that becomes an object of gene|ral exchange or transfer, <HI>mu&s;t, and ever will, be e&s;timated by the current or common price it will bring in market.</HI></P>

<PB N="309" REF="023972_0316_0FC2A80B8225CE00">
both at home and abroad, That <HI>they mu&s;t be paid.</HI></P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e, I beg the candid attention of my reader to the following propo&s;itions:</P>
<P>I. <HI>No public creditor who receives a certificate, is thereby paid any more than the value of the certificate at the time of delivery, i. e.</HI> it is not the <HI>nominal value</HI> but the <HI>real value</HI> only, <HI>i. e.</HI> the current price of it, which is to be regarded in e&s;timating the quantity of payment made by it.</P>
<P>When any body propo&s;es to pay a debt in bills of ex|change, bills of paper money, certificates, or any bills of public or private credit (if the creditor agrees to accept &s;uch payment) the fir&s;t que&s;tion that invariably occurs is, <HI>what is the exchange?</HI> i. e. <HI>no regard</HI> at all is paid to the <HI>nominal</HI> value, but reference is con&s;tantly had to <HI>the ex|change</HI> or <HI>current price</HI> in market, in order to determine what amount of &s;uch bills &s;hall be given to &s;atisfy the debt. This practice is &s;o <HI>univer&s;al</HI> among all men, and grounded on &s;uch <HI>manife&s;t principles of right,</HI> that I cannot conceive that any man can be found, who will di&s;pute either the reality or propriety of it.</P>
<P><HI>The practice of Congre&s;s,</HI> the &s;upreme council of the Uni|on, <HI>affords a precedent of this &s;ame principle,</HI> adopted by them, re&s;pecting their <HI>loan-office certificates.</HI></P>
<P>They publi&s;hed by their authority a <HI>&s;cale of depreciation,</HI> by which the value of tho&s;e certificates was e&s;timated at the <HI>real exchange</HI> they had at the <HI>time of their dates,</HI> and the rate of their <HI>final redemption</HI> was fixed on the &s;ame prin|ciple.</P>
<P><HI>All the States adopted the &s;ame principle,</HI> either by making u&s;e of the &s;cale of Congre&s;s, or e&s;tabli&s;hing &s;cales of their own, by which the value of Continental money was e&s;ti|mated thro' all the &s;tages of its depreciation.</P>
<P>This practice of Congre&s;s and of all the States was founded not only on ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity, but on the plaine&s;t principles of right; and if they made any deviation from ju&s;tice, in the adju&s;tment of any of their &s;cales, this was no error in the principle, but merely a fault in the practice or u&s;e of it. And &s;urely there can be <HI>no rea&s;on why</HI> the
<PB N="310" REF="023972_0317_0FC2A8160FDFA110">
&s;ame rule (if a good one) of e&s;timating the real value of certificates i&s;&s;ued in 1777 and the &s;ub&s;equent years, &s;hould not be applied to the certificates which were i&s;&s;ued at the clo&s;e of the war.</P>
<P>But there is certainly <HI>great rea&s;on why</HI> our mo&s;t virtuous citizens, who, by their patriotic efforts, &s;ervices, and &s;up|plies, <HI>&s;upported the war,</HI> and <HI>&s;aved our country,</HI> &s;hould not be &s;ubjected to the lo&s;s of <HI>&s;even-eighths</HI> of their ju&s;t dues, for want of &s;uch a rule, or &s;ome other means of &s;aving them from &s;uch ruinous and <HI>&s;hameful inju&s;tice.</HI></P>
<P>Farther, let us appeal to <HI>plain, common &s;en&s;e</HI> on this &s;ub|ject. When the public accounts were &s;ettled at the clo&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the war, the public creditors were entitled to their &s;e|veral balances due to them from the States, <HI>in good hard money.</HI> Now can any po&s;&s;ible rea&s;on be given, why a cer|tificate worth but 2<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> &s;hould be good payment to them, of 20<HI>s. at that time,</HI> any more than <HI>now at this time?</HI> I believe it will be readily admitted, that if any body (per|&s;onal or aggregate) &s;hould, at this time, &s;eriou&s;ly propo&s;e <HI>to pay a debt of</HI> 20<HI>s.</HI> with a certificate or any thing el&s;e, which <HI>was worth but</HI> 2<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> the offer would be rejected with every degree of <HI>contempt,</HI> as a mo&s;t <HI>villainous</HI> and <HI>ra&s;|cally in&s;ult.</HI></P>
<P>Is there one Member of Congre&s;s, who would not think him&s;elf abu&s;ed by the offer of a certificate worth 3-5<HI>ths of a dollar,</HI> in full &s;atisfaction of <HI>&s;ix dollars,</HI> which he expects for one day's attendance in the hou&s;e? but how aggravated and keen, would be his feelings and chagrin, if he &s;hould neglect his family and private concerns, and attend Con|gre&s;s &s;even years, and, at the end of the term, &s;hould be paid off in <HI>certificates of the &s;ame depreciated value!</HI></P>
<P>Or, do you think his vexation would be <HI>&s;oftened</HI> any, by being told, that tho' his certificates were really worth at pre&s;ent <HI>but</HI> 2<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d. in the pound,</HI> yet the &s;um <HI>expre&s;&s;ed on the face</HI> of them was 20<HI>s.</HI> in the pound, and therefore he mu&s;t be &s;atisfied with them as good and <HI>full payment,</HI> and if he would have patience to keep them <HI>long enough,</HI> they might perhaps bring him the full, real value expre&s;&s;ed in them?</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="023972_0318_0FC2A82920D964B0">
I believe every Member of Congre&s;s will readily allow, that I have hit on what would be the <HI>true feelings</HI> of any of his brethren, and even of him&s;elf, in &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ed ca&s;e. If &s;o, gentlemen, plea&s;e to <HI>do as you would be done by;</HI> this <HI>rule of conduct</HI> is enjoined upon you by an autho|rity much &s;uperior, and far paramount, to any you can lay the lea&s;t claim to, in your utmo&s;t dignity, and fulle&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;overeign power.</P>
<P>From all this it appears evident, that the public creditors, who have received certificates in payment, were paid <HI>no more than the current value or exchange</HI> of the certificates, at the time they received them. <HI>So much is paid and no more,</HI> and &s;o much and no more they ought to be <HI>debited,</HI> and the <HI>re&s;idue of the debt,</HI> not having been paid, is &s;till <HI>due to them.</HI></P>
<P>It farther appears, that the certificates which were de|livered to the <HI>&s;oldiers</HI> and <HI>other public creditors,</HI> on the final &s;ettlement of their accounts, after the clo&s;e of the war, were worth <HI>not more than</HI> 2<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> in the pound, which ought to be <HI>debited</HI> to them, and the <HI>remaining</HI> 17<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d. in the pound,</HI> being unpaid, &s;till <HI>remains due</HI> to them.</P>
<P>II. <HI>The&s;e balances which remain unpaid to the public credi|tors, ought to be paid as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</HI> The &s;ums due to them are their <HI>dear, their painful earnings;</HI> the&s;e claim|ants are the <HI>&s;oldiers who fought,</HI> and the <HI>citizens who &s;up|plied</HI> them, when the <HI>&s;alvation of our country</HI> was the great <HI>prize contended for;</HI> it is owing to their virtuous and &s;trong exertions, that we have <HI>any thing left,</HI> either for our <HI>own enjoyment,</HI> or the <HI>payment of them.</HI></P>
<P>We have no in&s;tance in hi&s;tory, of an army who di&s;co|vered and practi&s;ed more &s;pirit, firmne&s;s, patience, di&s;ci|pline, fortitude, and zeal, either under the in&s;tant pre&s;&s;ure of the greate&s;t <HI>hard&s;hips and &s;ufferings,</HI> or in the &s;olemn and awful <HI>march to the mo&s;t dangerous enterpri&s;es,</HI> or in the arduous <HI>moments of battle,</HI> than were found in our troops.</P>
<P>Nor did they he&s;itate or faulter in the lea&s;t, till they had <HI>completed their great work,</HI> rai&s;ed their <HI>own,</HI> their <HI>general's,</HI> and their <HI>country's</HI> honor and character to the utmo&s;t height, and reached the arduous goal which they had con|&s;tantly
<PB N="312" REF="023972_0319_0FC2A82A037FD408">
in view, thro' every &s;tage of their fatigue and dan|ger; this <HI>glorious goal</HI> was the <HI>complete liberation of one of the greate&s;t empires</HI> of the earth, which <HI>empire we are,</HI> who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">it clothed in all the maje&s;ty of empire, wealth, and power, &s;olemnly deliberating, <HI>whether we &s;hall pay the&s;e our deli|verers, or not.</HI></P>
<P>That "the <HI>laborer</HI> is worthy of his <HI>hire,</HI>" is the great doctrine of COMMUTATIVE JUSTICE, that <HI>divine law</HI> of nature, and <HI>nature's God,</HI> which, in the utmo&s;t <HI>maje&s;ty</HI> of command, connects the <HI>quid pro quo,</HI> that augu&s;t principle on which alone all <HI>thrones</HI> and <HI>governments</HI> can acquire and fix a <HI>permanent e&s;tabli&s;hment;</HI> this &s;acred principle, I &s;ay, requires that the&s;e worthy claimants &s;hould be paid the money due to them, becau&s;e they have <HI>dearly, nobly, and faithfully earned</HI> it.</P>
<P>There is in every human heart, a <HI>principle of right,</HI> a principle planted by the <HI>great Creator,</HI> ever approving the things which are mo&s;t excellent; how far &s;oever this &s;a|cred principle may become <HI>generally practical, emanate</HI> and <HI>&s;pread</HI> in &s;ociety, and <HI>govern and direct the general mind;</HI> yet the <HI>di&s;pen&s;ation</HI> of public ju&s;tice and right, lies <HI>in the power,</HI> and becomes the <HI>peculiar duty, of a few men,</HI> the cho&s;en and dignified <HI>few,</HI> to whom the admini&s;tration of the great affairs and intere&s;ts of the nation are commit|ted.</P>
<P>The&s;e dignified per&s;onages are &s;ometimes called <HI>gods;</HI> they certainly &s;it in the place of God, and whether given to the people in <HI>wrath</HI> or <HI>mercy,</HI> are certainly appointed by him, and the &s;acred <HI>charge and duty</HI> of imitating his government lies on them; <HI>judgment and ju&s;tice</HI> are the ha|bitation of his throne; and the&s;e &s;acred virtues ought al|ways to be found in our &s;upreme council, not as <HI>tran&s;ient per&s;ons</HI> who may be called in on favorite occa&s;ions, where their pre&s;ence may be pretty well admitted, and their in|&s;pection may be tolerable, but as <HI>con&s;tant re&s;idents,</HI> who take up their dwelling there, as the place of their <HI>uniform habitation.</HI></P>
<P>With a heart melted in &s;ympathy with the <HI>&s;ufferings</HI> of my country's <HI>deliverers,</HI> with a &s;ublimated &s;en&s;e of the

<HI>importance,</HI> as well as <HI>&s;acred nature,</HI> of the <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>judg|ment</HI> of our nation, I mo&s;t devoutly implore (and doubt not the concurrence of every hone&s;t <HI>American</HI>) that the&s;e <HI>&s;overeign and &s;acred virtues</HI> may <HI>dwell,</HI> not only in our &s;u|preme <HI>councils,</HI> but in the heart of every <HI>member who &s;hall give his vote</HI> in the deci&s;ion of this mo&s;t capital and inte|re&s;ting cau&s;e which I am pleading.</P>
<P>Another thing which ought to induce us to pay the&s;e worthy citizens is, <HI>their brilliant &s;ucce&s;s, and the mo&s;t im|portant benefits we derive from their exertions.</HI> I do not &s;ay that <HI>&s;ucce&s;s</HI> &s;imply is a <HI>virtue,</HI> but it is a very great <HI>proof</HI> of it, in as much as &s;ucce&s;s generally follows <HI>prudent, &s;pirited,</HI> and <HI>per&s;evering</HI> conduct; nor do I &s;ay that <HI>rewards</HI> ought to be proportioned to the <HI>benefits</HI> received; for by this rule we can never <HI>pay enough</HI> to our deliverers; but where the benefits accruing from virtuous exertions are very great, they at lea&s;t become entitled to a <HI>full compen&s;ation,</HI> and per|haps liberal minds will think <HI>a generous one</HI> might with great propriety be allowed.</P>
<P>We call general <HI>Wa&s;hington,</HI> the <HI>father</HI> and <HI>&s;aviour</HI> of his country, and with great propriety; the virtues <HI>of a fa|ther</HI> he might have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed <HI>alone,</HI> but <HI>the &s;aviour</HI> of his country he <HI>could not have been without his army.</HI> He in|deed de&s;igned with <HI>di&s;cernment,</HI> commanded with <HI>prudence,</HI> and led on his troops with <HI>fortitude;</HI> but altho' the&s;e vir|tues were carried by him beyond the power of imitation, the &s;ucce&s;s mu&s;t have failed, had not his <HI>army co-operated</HI> with his de&s;igns effectually, <HI>obeyed</HI> his orders cheerfully, and <HI>followed</HI> him with firmne&s;s; without the&s;e, neither his laurels could have been obtained, nor our deliverance have been completed.</P>
<P><HI>They were his faithful companions</HI> in <HI>di&s;tre&s;&s;es,</HI> in <HI>dangers,</HI> in <HI>battles,</HI> in <HI>victories;</HI> they &s;hared his <HI>fortunes,</HI> they &s;hared his <HI>merits,</HI> and they per&s;evered with him, till they al&s;o &s;hared his <HI>final &s;ucce&s;&s;es,</HI> which put a period to <HI>their</HI> long and patient <HI>labors,</HI> and our <HI>country's calamities.</HI></P>
<P>How would all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ine feelings of the human mind have <HI>glowed in the brea&s;t</HI> of that exalted general, if, in that period of <HI>triumphant and final &s;ucce&s;s,</HI> he could have

called the&s;e his <HI>dear</HI> and <HI>worthy fellow-laborers</HI> and <HI>fellow-&s;ufferers</HI> together, met their brightened countenances with the warme&s;t <HI>mutual congratulations, thanked</HI> them for their &s;ervices, and <HI>di&s;mi&s;&s;ed</HI> them with <HI>&s;uch rewards,</HI> as would have enabled them to return to their families with &s;ome degree of <HI>advantage,</HI> as well as <HI>honor.</HI></P>
<P>But I will draw a veil over the re&s;t, and only &s;ay, the <HI>hard nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of the times prevented this; the general knew it, the &s;oldiers knew it, and &s;ubmitted with <HI>patience</HI> to ac|cept their di&s;charge, and find their way home as they could, with <HI>empty hands</HI> and dry lips.</P>
<P>Is it po&s;&s;ible that the <HI>great councils of America &s;hall &s;uffer &s;uch per&s;evering fortitude, di&s;cipline, and patience to go with|out their reward? Generous allowances</HI> are not demanded; <HI>liberal appointments</HI> are not &s;olicited; no more is required than the <HI>&s;imple pay</HI> which was <HI>promi&s;ed</HI> them by Congre&s;s; all they a&s;k for, is the fulfilment of that <HI>&s;acred contract,</HI> which is grounded on the <HI>public faith and honor of an em|pire.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed, I think that the <HI>patient and quiet behaviour</HI> of the <HI>real</HI> public creditors, both at the clo&s;e of the war and &s;ince, entitles them to the <HI>highe&s;t e&s;teem</HI> and re&s;pect of all our ci|tizens, and &s;hould excite a very &s;trong zeal, to make the mo&s;t powerful efforts <HI>to do them right;</HI> it is certainly <HI>mean, ba&s;e,</HI> and <HI>&s;hameful,</HI> it is <HI>below</HI> the <HI>dignity</HI> of a nation, to <HI>deny</HI> or <HI>delay that ju&s;tice</HI> to virtuous, <HI>quiet,</HI> and <HI>well-behaved citizens,</HI> which would be granted to <HI>tumult, uproar,</HI> and <HI>in&s;urrection.</HI></P>
<P>Will any man pre&s;ume to &s;ay they are <HI>quiet,</HI> becau&s;e it is not in their power to make <HI>di&s;turbance?</HI> This is very ill-natured; but were it really the ca&s;e, it would bring them into the rank of <HI>helple&s;s per&s;ons,</HI> like the widows and fatherle&s;s, who have <HI>rights which they are not able to a&s;&s;ert</HI> and &s;upport; the&s;e are entitled to the mo&s;t <HI>peculiar</HI> and <HI>tender protections</HI> of the government; the <HI>wrongs</HI> and <HI>oppre&s;|&s;ions</HI> of &s;uch as the&s;e, are always ranked among the <HI>mo&s;t horrid</HI> and <HI>cruel acts</HI> of inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>But I do not conceive this to be the <HI>real fact;</HI> all States have found that there may be as great force and &s;trength

in the <HI>&s;till, &s;mall voice,</HI> as in the <HI>explo&s;ions</HI> that break the cedars of <HI>Lebanon;</HI> it is not commonly <HI>a fretfulne&s;s of tem|per</HI> in the people, but the <HI>cau&s;e of complaint,</HI> which breeds di&s;turbances in a State; it is rare that people can be work|ed up into general in&s;urrection, without &s;ome <HI>great and general cau&s;e.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Wrongs</HI> and <HI>oppre&s;&s;ions</HI> diffu&s;ed over a State will always <HI>&s;ow the &s;eeds</HI> of di&s;content; the&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">it <HI>ea&s;y on nobody;</HI> but al|ways operate by way of fret and re&s;entment, and are ge|nerally the <HI>cau&s;es of &s;erious in&s;urrections,</HI> and &s;ometimes of mo&s;t <HI>capital</HI> revolutions, in government; I know of <HI>but one &s;ure way</HI> to keep the people quiet and ea&s;y in any govern|ment, and that is, to cau&s;e <HI>'ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>judgment</HI> to run down its &s;treets, and <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> to cover it.'</P>
<P>But it ought to be noted here, that tho' the proper way to keep the &s;ubjects of any State in <HI>quietne&s;s,</HI> is to do them <HI>ju&s;tice,</HI> yet it does not follow, that no men will be <HI>quiet</HI> under wrongs; many virtuous and good citizens will put up with injuries, and bear them with patience, rather than engage in pur&s;uits for redre&s;s, which may make the <HI>remedy wor&s;e than the di&s;ea&s;e;</HI> few men would be willing to foment public di&s;turbances, and make the land of their nativity a <HI>&s;cene of de&s;olation</HI> and horror, to gain <HI>redre&s;s</HI> of per&s;onal wrongs, or to gratify a <HI>&s;pirit of revenge.</HI></P>
<P>Many good men would patiently &s;uffer injuries, rather than even give <HI>unea&s;ine&s;s</HI> to their oppre&s;&s;ors, e&s;pecially where the wrong happens to proceed from &s;ome <HI>near con|nection,</HI> a <HI>brother,</HI> a <HI>father,</HI> or perhaps the <HI>fathers</HI> of their country; but this virtuous patience under injury I deem highly <HI>meritorious,</HI> and de&s;erving the utmo&s;t <HI>attention</HI> to their <HI>rights,</HI> and the <HI>redre&s;s</HI> of their <HI>wrongs.</HI></P>
<P>But when the very people from whom redre&s;s is ex|pected, begin to take advantage of the peaceable di&s;po&s;i|tion of &s;uch a citizen, to think him <HI>void of &s;pirit,</HI> and pro|ceed to <HI>in&s;ult</HI> his wrongs, <HI>trifle</HI> with his demands, <HI>ridicule</HI> his preten&s;ions, and plead <HI>ab&s;urd arguments</HI> in avoidance of his claims, <HI>arguments</HI> which are a <HI>burle&s;que of common &s;en&s;e,</HI> and which cannot meet the approbation of that <HI>di&s;cerning power,</HI> which the all-wi&s;e Creator has <HI>planted</HI> in every hu|man
<PB N="316" REF="023972_0323_0FC2A847130A7B30">
mind, as the great <HI>index of right and wrong;</HI> I &s;ay, when in&s;ults of this &s;ort are added to injuries, there is a <HI>point, a bound, beyond which</HI> human patience will not en|dure, and, of cour&s;e, &s;uch injuries never will be <HI>offered</HI> to any per&s;on who is &s;uppo&s;ed to be in condition to <HI>a&s;&s;ert and vindicate his own rights,</HI> or to <HI>re&s;ent properly the in&s;ults offer|ed to him.</HI></P>
<P>For example, let us &s;uppo&s;e that the <HI>Continental army,</HI> officers and men, with <HI>tho&s;e who, by their contributions, fed and clothed them,</HI> were all <HI>met together,</HI> with their augu&s;t general at the head of them,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>When I wrote this I had no doubt but that, if &s;uch an a&s;&s;embly of <HI>fel|low-laborers</HI> and <HI>fellow-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> had appeared, their <HI>general</HI> would have cheerfully put him&s;elf at their <HI>head,</HI> and have <HI>&s;upported their &s;uit</HI> with all his power and influence.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o very manife&s;t, that both <HI>they</HI> and their <HI>rights</HI> are all, at this time, in <HI>real exi&s;tence and full life,</HI> tho' not all <HI>met</HI> together in condition to <HI>a&s;&s;ert and demand</HI> the ju&s;tice which is due to them.</P>
<P>It is further certain, that the <HI>known rights</HI> of an <HI>ab&s;ent man</HI> ought not to be neglected, becau&s;e he is <HI>not pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">t</HI> to a&s;&s;ert them, or in condition to vin|dicate his demand; <HI>infants,</HI> and all other <HI>helple&s;s</HI> per&s;ons, have rights which are ever <HI>recogni&s;ed</HI> by the <HI>law of right,</HI> and ought ever to be <HI>&s;upported</HI> by <HI>the government,</HI> to which the admini&s;tration of that <HI>law of right</HI> is committed.</P></NOTE> and, in this <HI>re&s;pectable</HI> &s;tate, &s;hould pre&s;ent their humble petition to Congre&s;s <HI>for their pay;</HI> do you think, gentlemen, that there <HI>is a man in all the States,</HI> either in or out of Congre&s;s, who would ven|ture to tell them <HI>they were paid already, and had no right to expect any thing farther from their country?</HI></P>
<P>If a &s;peech of this &s;ort is &s;uppo&s;able, it may be proper to con&s;ider it a little more particularly. I conceive that any &s;peech directed to an army, the great &s;ubject of which is, to per&s;uade them, after &s;even years' hard &s;ervice, <HI>to go off quietly without their pay,</HI> mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily carry in it <HI>ma|terials &s;omewhat rough, har&s;h,</HI> and not much &s;uited to the <HI>ta&s;te of the hearers;</HI> it will therefore, doubtle&s;s, be nece&s;|&s;ary to <HI>&s;often and &s;weeten</HI> it as much as may be, in order to in&s;ure its <HI>proper effect.</HI></P>
<P>I will go on then to &s;uppo&s;e, if you plea&s;e, that &s;ome grave per&s;on of known wi&s;dom, candor, and poli&s;hed man|ners, &s;hould ri&s;e up to make an addre&s;s to this <HI>great</HI> and <HI>re&s;pectable body</HI> of citizens, which, I think we may pre|&s;ume,

<P>I do not blame you in this di&s;tre&s;s for &s;elling your certificates; but you ought to have con&s;ider|ed, that, when you &s;old them, you <HI>made over</HI> and <HI>tran&s;|ferred</HI> all your <HI>right to payment,</HI> for all your <HI>&s;ervices</HI> and <HI>advances</HI> to your country, and, therefore, ought not to have &s;old them <HI>&s;o cheap;</HI> you really <HI>hurt</HI> your&s;elves, and <HI>deba&s;ed</HI> the honor and credit of the States, by that im|prudent &s;tep; had you been <HI>wi&s;e enough</HI> to have &s;old them at 20<HI>s.</HI> in the pound, <HI>your nece&s;&s;ities</HI> had been bet|ter relieved, and all <HI>this trouble</HI> and <HI>perplexity</HI> which you give your&s;elves and <HI>us,</HI> would have been prevented.</P>

<P> You might as well blame us for not turn|ing our certificates into <HI>joes</HI> and <HI>guineas;</HI> you know as well as we, that it was <HI>ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible</HI> to get <HI>more</HI> for them, or do <HI>better</HI> with them, than we did; we received the cer|tificates made <HI>payable to the bearer,</HI> and of cour&s;e, <HI>negotiable,</HI> and <HI>calculated</HI> to be <HI>bought</HI> and <HI>&s;old, i. e.</HI> to circulate like ca&s;h thro' <HI>any and every hand;</HI> but we had no idea when we &s;old them, that we <HI>&s;old</HI> any more than we <HI>received;</HI> or that our &s;elling them <HI>de&s;troyed</HI> our demand on the States, for <HI>that part</HI> of our earnings which we had <HI>not received,</HI> and which was <HI>not paid</HI> to us; nor can we conceive, how our &s;ale of <HI>negotiable</HI> certificates can operate on our <HI>real earnings</HI> like an <HI>enchanter's wand,</HI> &s;o as to <HI>annihilate</HI> them, or turn them into a <HI>mi&s;t.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>ORATOR.</SPEAKER>
<P> I ob&s;erve, gentlemen, you grow &s;ome|what warm; I wi&s;h to avoid all ill-humor and hard lan|guage; you have <HI>de&s;erved nobly;</HI> you have gained <HI>great honor;</HI> you have <HI>&s;aved your country;</HI> and I hope, after all this merit, you will neither <HI>tarni&s;h</HI> your own <HI>honors,</HI> nor <HI>di&s;turb</HI> your country's <HI>peace,</HI> by your unea&s;ine&s;s and <HI>di&s;content.</HI></P>
<P>What is done is pa&s;&s;ed and cannot be recalled; I ear|ne&s;tly recommend to you, my dear and honored fellow-citizens, to <HI>return home peaceably and quietly</HI> like virtuous and good chri&s;tians, and <HI>go to work double tides,</HI> to rai&s;e money to pay the <HI>pre&s;ent holders</HI> of your certificates; for however fooli&s;hly you parted with them <HI>under value,</HI> yet the <HI>public faith</HI> is annexed to them, and mu&s;t be &s;up|ported.</P>
</SP>
<P>I appeal to every man in the Union, whether this ad|dre&s;s, or rather dialogue, does not &s;tate <HI>every fact</HI> and <HI>eve|ry argument, truly</HI> and <HI>fairly;</HI> and whether &s;uch a &s;tate|ment of facts and arguments would be likely to <HI>&s;end the hearers home</HI> contented and quiet, without their pay; I trow not. If the above &s;tatement is <HI>not right,</HI> I challenge <HI>any body that can, to mend it;</HI> for my part, I freely own my opinion, that the whole harangue, tho' ever &s;o <HI>well-dre&s;&s;ed and poli&s;hed,</HI> is, and mu&s;t be, from the <HI>nature of the facts,</HI> an <HI>in&s;ult</HI> not only on the&s;e worthy <HI>citizens,</HI> who rendered their &s;upplies and &s;ervices to their country during the war, but on <HI>common &s;en&s;e it&s;elf,</HI> and mu&s;t <HI>wound</HI> the <HI>natural feel|ings</HI> of the humane mind, and which no man of hone&s;ty and candor could ever make in the <HI>ab&s;ence</HI> of the parties, and which no man, who had any regard to <HI>per&s;onal &s;afety,</HI> would dare to make in the <HI>pre&s;ence</HI> of them.</P>
<P>The Orator's plan is, to con&s;ider the certificates deliver|ed to the public creditors, on the &s;ettlement of their de|mands, for &s;upplies and &s;ervices rendered during the war, to con&s;ider the&s;e certificates, I &s;ay, as <HI>full payment of the &s;um due to them,</HI> and to <HI>redeem</HI> the certificates at full <HI>nomi|nal</HI> value, by <HI>payments</HI> made to the <HI>bearers</HI> of them.</P>
<P>It is farther a mo&s;t plain fact, that the certificates were not worth <HI>more than</HI> 2<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d. in the pound,</HI> at the time they
<PB N="320" REF="023972_0327_0FC2A84C9BA93CE0">
were <HI>delivered to the real public creditors,</HI> on the final &s;ettle|ment of their accounts, after the clo&s;e of the war.</P>
<P>And it is a farther plain fact, that by far the <HI>greate&s;t part</HI> of the&s;e certificates have been &s;old by the original holders, in their nece&s;&s;ities and di&s;tre&s;&s;es, to per&s;ons who are <HI>now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed</HI> of them, <HI>at</HI> 2<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d. in the pound,</HI> or at mo&s;t for &s;ome <HI>trifle</HI> which bears but &s;mall proportion to the <HI>nominal value.</HI></P>
<P>Now this plan, <HI>dre&s;s</HI> it, and <HI>cook</HI> it, and <HI>&s;ea&s;on</HI> it, and <HI>color</HI> it in <HI>any</HI> and <HI>every</HI> way you po&s;&s;ibly can, if carried into execution, will mo&s;t <HI>nece&s;&s;arily</HI> and <HI>unavoidably</HI> draw after it the&s;e two con&s;equences:</P>
<P N="1">1. That a &s;um of <HI>many millions</HI> of money mu&s;t be levi|ed and collected from the <HI>labor</HI> and <HI>painful earnings</HI> of the citizens of the States, <HI>not to be paid</HI> to the <HI>worthy citizens,</HI> who, by their <HI>&s;upplies</HI> and <HI>&s;ervices,</HI> during their country's <HI>di&s;tre&s;s,</HI> have <HI>merited</HI> and <HI>earned</HI> it, but to be paid to num|bers of rich <HI>&s;peculators,</HI> who have <HI>no pretence</HI> of having <HI>merited</HI> or <HI>earned</HI> any of it, and who will, upon the <HI>earn|ings of tho&s;e others,</HI> make a <HI>profit immen&s;e,</HI> not le&s;s in thou|&s;ands of in&s;tances than 1000 <HI>per cent.</HI> Whil&s;t,</P>
<P N="2">2. The great bulk of the worthy citizens, who, by their &s;upplies and &s;ervices, <HI>really</HI> and <HI>dearly merited</HI> and <HI>earned</HI> the money, but who <HI>have &s;old</HI> their certificates (which is the ca&s;e of by far the greate&s;t part of them) mu&s;t and will <HI>ab&s;olutely and finally lo&s;e</HI> 7-8<HI>ths,</HI> and very many <HI>even eleven parts out of twelve,</HI> of their <HI>real merits</HI> and <HI>painful earnings,</HI> from which <HI>&s;hameful</HI> inju&s;tice, <HI>Good Lord, deliver us.</HI></P>
<P>I beg leave here to a&s;k the gentlemen who compo&s;e our &s;upreme admini&s;tration, legi&s;lative, executive, and official,</P>
<P N="1">1. Whether they can po&s;&s;ibly reconcile their own minds <HI>to any plan</HI> which involves &s;uch <HI>gro&s;s inju&s;tice?</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Whether any of them could be prevailed on, at any time of their lives, on any con&s;ideration, to pay <HI>a private debt of their own of</HI> 20<HI>s.</HI> with a <HI>certificate,</HI> or any other <HI>de|preciated paper, worth but</HI> 2<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.?</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Whether in heaven or earth (and farther we need not go) I &s;ay, whether in heaven or earth, there can be

found a <HI>rea&s;on</HI> which can <HI>ju&s;tify</HI> a <HI>mini&s;ter of State,</HI> or any <HI>public man,</HI> employed in the di&s;pen&s;ation of the <HI>ju&s;tice and judgment</HI> of a nation, in <HI>devi&s;ing or doing</HI> any thing, which, in his <HI>per&s;onal</HI> capacity, would <HI>wound his honor</HI> and <HI>con&s;cience,</HI> and <HI>damn</HI> him to <HI>eternal infamy and contempt.</HI></P>
<P>It is known to every body, that at the clo&s;e of the war, our nation was <HI>bankrupt;</HI> at lea&s;t they <HI>&s;topped payment,</HI> could not, and did not, <HI>do ju&s;tice</HI> to tho&s;e to whom they were <HI>ju&s;tly indebted;</HI> and if we could not pay them <HI>when we ought,</HI> the only way to heal and remedy the matter, is <HI>to pay them when we can;</HI> and it is mighty plain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> if we <HI>ho|ne&s;tly mean</HI> to pay our debts, we mu&s;t not only pay the <HI>whole money we owe,</HI> but mu&s;t pay it to tho&s;e <HI>to whom we owe it;</HI> for paying it to any <HI>body el&s;e</HI> can be no &s;atisfaction of the debt.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more ab&s;urd than to apply the <HI>common rule of a&s;&s;ignments</HI> of negotiable notes, bills of exchange, &amp;c. to the public certificates; the exchange of the one rarely ri&s;es or falls more than 4 <HI>or</HI> 5 <HI>per cent.;</HI> the depreci|ation of the other is 15 <HI>or</HI> 20 <HI>times as much,</HI> and is &s;o enor|mous, that the <HI>principal value</HI> is ab&s;orbed by it, and not more than 1-8<HI>th or</HI> 1-10<HI>th part of the nominal value in reality re|mains;</HI> here is an <HI>extreme ca&s;e</HI> indeed, and it is well known that every <HI>law, right,</HI> or <HI>rule of morality</HI> is <HI>limited to its mean or rea&s;onable application;</HI> the moment it diverges there-from, and flies into <HI>its extreme,</HI> it lo&s;es its <HI>rectitude</HI> and <HI>equity,</HI> and becomes <HI>injurious and wrong;</HI> and the &s;ure and infallible <HI>criterion</HI> of &s;uch extreme, is when &s;uch applicati|on operates by way of <HI>inju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>de&s;truction of right.</HI></P>
<P>And in the ca&s;e in point before us, the application of the common rule of a&s;&s;ignments, to the certificates, has a nece&s;&s;ary operation, mo&s;t <HI>cruel, injurious,</HI> and <HI>hurtful</HI> in two re&s;pects:</P>
<P N="1">1. It takes an immen&s;e <HI>&s;um</HI> of money from <HI>virtuous ci|tizens, who dearly merited</HI> and <HI>earned it,</HI> and &s;ubjects them to a <HI>total</HI> and <HI>ruinous</HI> lo&s;s; whil&s;t,</P>
<P N="2">2. It conveys the &s;ame <HI>immen&s;e &s;um</HI> to <HI>other men, who never merited or earned it all,</HI> and gives them an <HI>enormous</HI>
<PB N="322" REF="023972_0329_0FC2A84FB7987BA0">
<HI>profit</HI> of 1000 per cent. on the <HI>merits and earnings</HI> of the lo&s;ers.</P>
<P>This whole doctrine is &s;o perfectly known and familiar to all doctors in <HI>law</HI> and <HI>morality,</HI> that they have adopted it for a proverb or maxim, <HI>&s;ummum jus, &s;umma injuria, i. e. right in extreme</HI> becomes <HI>extreme wrong;</HI> and nobody ever pretended to di&s;pute this maxim, who was not either mo&s;t poignantly pre&s;&s;ed with argument (in which ca&s;e the &s;chool|men will make any &s;hifts) or hurried and impelled <HI>by &s;ome favorite &s;cheme or intere&s;t,</HI> out of all their <HI>philo&s;ophy, decen|cy, and common &s;en&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>There is another plan or method of doing this bu&s;ine&s;s, which appears to me much more <HI>ju&s;t and equitable,</HI> and quite <HI>as ea&s;y</HI> as the one I have been exploding, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Let <HI>every certificate be e&s;timated by a &s;cale of value, grounded on the current price or exchange of it at its date, and at this va|lue let it be debited to every public creditor who received it, and at the &s;ame value,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>I apprehend that certificates &s;hould never be redeemed at a higher rate than their value or current exchange was at the time of i&s;&s;uing them; for the public never received a valuable con&s;ideration for any more than was paid; and to demand their redemption at a higher value would be charging the public with <HI>u&s;urious intere&s;t,</HI> which would be as wrong between <HI>public,</HI> as between <HI>private, contractors.</HI></P>
<P>It may be objected, perhaps, that the public do not <HI>literally receive</HI> 2<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> and give their bond or certificate for 20<HI>s.:</HI> but I an&s;wer, they <HI>really</HI> do this; for it is very plain, that the certificate, when i&s;&s;ued, was worth <HI>no more than its current exchange</HI> at that time, <HI>&s;ay</HI> 2<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.:</HI> the public creditor received <HI>no more,</HI> and ought to be <HI>debited with no more;</HI> but the certificate is made payable to the <HI>bearer, who is a &s;tranger,</HI> at 20<HI>s.</HI></P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> if I pay 2<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> and, in con&s;ideration thereof, take a bond to a third <HI>per&s;on, who is a &s;tranger,</HI> for 20<HI>s.</HI> it is plain that the <HI>bond is u&s;urious and void,</HI> and if it <HI>pa&s;&s;es by a&s;&s;ignment</HI> thro' a <HI>thou&s;and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ds,</HI> the <HI>u&s;ury</HI> will always <HI>&s;tick</HI> to it, and, of cour&s;e, it will ever carry with it its <HI>legal defect,</HI> or <HI>prin|ciple of avoidance.</HI></P>
<P>For it is plain, that if a private man &s;hould receive 2<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> and give his bond for 20<HI>s.</HI> the bond would be u&s;urious, and of cour&s;e void.</P>
<P>My propo&s;ition is plainly ju&s;t, and acknowledged by Congre&s;s and every body el&s;e, and has the &s;anction of general practice with re&s;pect to <HI>loan-office certificates, Continental money,</HI> &amp;c. and I challenge any man to give a &s;hadow of rea&s;on, why all &s;ub&s;equent <HI>certificates,</HI> or <HI>paper of public cre|dit,</HI> &s;hould not be e&s;timated, and in every re&s;pect be governed, by the &s;ame rule.</P>
<P>But if the certificate depreciates <HI>below its original value,</HI> the aggregate public <HI>&s;u&s;tains the lo&s;s.</HI> This is manife&s;tly the ca&s;e with re&s;pect to all paper money, certificates, and other public &s;ecurities of every kind, which gain a general currency, or become objects of common exchange and negotia|tion thro' the community, and happen to depreciate during &s;uch currency.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s by depreciation becomes divided into <HI>innumerable parts,</HI> every <HI>&s;ingle one</HI> of which con&s;i&s;ts of the <HI>lo&s;s</HI> each individual &s;everally <HI>&s;u&s;tained</HI> by the depreciation of the paper, whil&s;t <HI>it was in his bands,</HI> and the aggregate &s;um of all <HI>the&s;e parts</HI> or lo&s;&s;es, makes up the <HI>whole &s;um</HI> of the depreciation, or the <HI>difference</HI> between the <HI>current value</HI> of the paper at the time, and the <HI>ori|ginal value</HI> of it when it fir&s;t i&s;&s;ued.</P>
<P>By this it appears, that the aggregate public has &s;u&s;tained the whole lo&s;s, not in a way of perfect equality indeed (and perhaps no public a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment ever did or can do this) but by way of general tax, of which innumerable individuals (tho' not &s;trictly every one) has &s;u&s;tained or paid his &s;hare, and, of cour&s;e, it would be very unju&s;t to tax the &s;ame public over again for &s;uch &s;um, not to pay it to the <HI>per&s;ons who have &s;uffered</HI> by the depreciation, but to <HI>other</HI> people, who have <HI>lo&s;t nothing,</HI> nor have any <HI>claim of merit</HI> to it.</P></NOTE> <HI>or at the current value (as the ca&s;e may</HI>
<PB N="323" REF="023972_0330_0FC2A8678AA20BC0">
<HI>require) let it be redeemed, with intere&s;t from its date to the time of its redemption,</HI> and let <HI>the remainder of the balances due to the public creditors, who have received certificates, be paid them in money with intere&s;t, as &s;oon as that can be done.</HI></P>
<P>I know no rea&s;on why the real or current value of the certificates in que&s;tion &s;hould not be fixed by a &s;cale, as well as the loan-office certificates, and other depreciated public paper, during the war; this principle, as I before ob&s;erved, was adopted not only by Congre&s;s, but by all the States, as a matter of both ju&s;tice and nece&s;&s;ity, and the tender-acts and other infringements of this plan, were found totally wrongful, and, of cour&s;e, were repealed.</P>
<P>No human plan of di&s;pen&s;ing commutative ju&s;tice to a nation, can ever be perfect and wholly free from error; all that human wi&s;dom and human virtue can do, is to adopt that plan, which, in its operation, &s;hall produce <HI>the mo&s;t ju&s;tice and right,</HI> and the <HI>lea&s;t injury and wrong,</HI> of any that can be devi&s;ed, and carry the plan into effect by the mo&s;t equitable <HI>admini&s;tration</HI> which can be practi&s;ed.</P>
<P>If this then is a good rule or criterion of a good plan (which certainly no man can &s;eriou&s;ly deny) let us try the two plans by this infallible touch&s;tone, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> which of them, in its operation, will produce the <HI>mo&s;t ju&s;tice and utility,</HI> and avoid the <HI>greate&s;t injury and wrong.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. The ju&s;tice and utility of the one is reduced by its operation <HI>to almo&s;t nothing,</HI> whil&s;t the <HI>injuries</HI> and <HI>wrongs</HI> it
<PB N="324" REF="023972_0331_0FC2A86904EC1220">
produces are <HI>enormous, dete&s;table,</HI> and <HI>almo&s;t infinite;</HI> no le&s;s than depriving numberle&s;s citizens of 9-10<HI>ths</HI> of the reward due to their great <HI>merits</HI> and <HI>&s;ervices,</HI> and &s;ub|jecting them to a <HI>final</HI> and <HI>total lo&s;s</HI> of the &s;ame, whil&s;t it heaps the <HI>immen&s;e wealth</HI> (which is <HI>their due,</HI> and <HI>which they lo&s;e</HI>) on <HI>another cla&s;s</HI> of men, who have <HI>no pretence to any merit</HI> at all.</P>
<P N="2">2. The other plan gives to tho&s;e <HI>meritorious citizens all the rewards</HI> to which they are entitled, and if any inju&s;tice has been done them by the long delay, it is in &s;ome mea|&s;ure made up to them by the intere&s;t it propo&s;es to give them, whil&s;t it gives to the <HI>purcha&s;ers</HI> of alienated certifi|cates, the <HI>&s;ame price</HI> for them which they were <HI>worth when fir&s;t i&s;&s;ued,</HI> with <HI>intere&s;t</HI> from <HI>that</HI> time till their <HI>redemption;</HI> and I think this is all they have a right to expect, and we may very well &s;ay to each of them, <HI>Take what is thine own with u&s;ury, and more we will not give thee.</HI></P>
<P>If this cla&s;s of men &s;u&s;tain any lo&s;s, it mu&s;t ari&s;e from their having purcha&s;ed certificates at a <HI>higher exchange</HI> or <HI>price</HI> than they bore when they were <HI>fir&s;t i&s;&s;ued,</HI> and this is a lo&s;s to which &s;peculations of that &s;ort are <HI>always expo&s;ed;</HI> if any of our rich and enterpri&s;ing citizens are di&s;po&s;ed to <HI>deal in &s;tocks, gamble in the funds,</HI> or to be concerned in any <HI>negotiations of hazard</HI> whatever, they all expect to be liable to a <HI>run of ill luck,</HI> as well as to <HI>good fortune;</HI> and I do not know that the public have much occa&s;ion to trouble them&s;elves about either their profit or lo&s;s.</P>
<P>But if the lo&s;&s;es of the&s;e men &s;hould be thought pitia|ble, they certainly, in either <HI>magnitude</HI> or <HI>di&s;tre&s;s,</HI> bear not the lea&s;t proportion to the <HI>heavy, ruinous lo&s;&s;es,</HI> which our mo&s;t <HI>virtuous</HI> and <HI>meritorious citizens</HI> mu&s;t &s;u&s;tain on <HI>the other plan;</HI> much le&s;s can they ju&s;tify the adoption of a plan in their favor, which will <HI>deprive</HI> our mo&s;t re&s;pectable citizens of the <HI>immen&s;e &s;ums</HI> due to their painful <HI>merit</HI> and <HI>&s;ervices,</HI> in order to <HI>lavi&s;h</HI> the &s;ame away on the&s;e adven|turous <HI>&s;peculators,</HI> and thereby accumulate the <HI>fortunes of the one,</HI> and the <HI>di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the other,</HI> to a degree almo&s;t infinite.</P>
<P><PB N="325" REF="023972_0332_0FC2A86A8765C4B0">
But after all, if the lo&s;&s;es of the&s;e &s;peculating gentry mu&s;t be thought to require compen&s;ation, I beg it may be made by <HI>the public,</HI> but by no means let it be <HI>carved out of the dear merits and earnings</HI> of the <HI>noble&s;t patriots</HI> of our country.</P>
<P>But the &s;acred duty of paying the&s;e worthy citizens, who have <HI>done and &s;uffered</HI> &s;o much for our country, and from who&s;e <HI>noble exertions</HI> we actually derive and enjoy mo&s;t <HI>ine&s;timable benefits,</HI> is not only enforced on us by every <HI>principle of ju&s;tice, honor,</HI> and <HI>gratitude;</HI> but it is farther recommended by many <HI>advantages</HI> and great <HI>inducements of intere&s;t,</HI> which are either involved in it, connected with it, or con&s;equential from it.

<P>I do not offer this as <HI>an airy compliment</HI> to the citizens of the States; but I do <HI>mo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly believe,</HI> that the wi&s;hes of our augu&s;t <HI>general,</HI> in the ca&s;e before us, and tho&s;e of <HI>the great body</HI> of our people, are the <HI>&s;ame,</HI> or at lea&s;t, <HI>&s;imilar;</HI> the operations of the war being under the <HI>direction</HI> of the general, and the more important parts, both of <HI>action and events,</HI> happening under the <HI>in&s;pection of his own eye,</HI> will doubtle&s;s excite in his mind more <HI>lively &s;entiments</HI> of <HI>many things and circum&s;tances,</HI> than the people at large can have; yet I think the conduct of tho&s;e worthy patriots who &s;up|ported the war by their &s;upplies and &s;ervices, <HI>meets the ap|probation of the people</HI> in &s;o univer&s;al a manner, that very few can be found, who would not &s;incerely join <HI>their au|gu&s;t general,</HI> in wi&s;hes that they may be paid.

<HI>paid.</HI> Let their <HI>merits</HI> be ever &s;o great, and our <HI>obligations</HI> to do them ju&s;tice be ever &s;o &s;acred, yet if our ca&s;e was &s;uch that we <HI>could not</HI> pay them, no more need be &s;aid on the &s;ubject; but if we <HI>can</HI> pay them, and <HI>do not,</HI> one would think that <HI>heaven and earth</HI> would ri&s;e in their favor, and <HI>revenge their wrongs.</HI></P>
<P>To prove that they can be paid, the following facts may, and doubtle&s;s will, be admitted to be <HI>true and convincing evidence.</HI></P>
<P>1. That the <HI>country is rich enough</HI> to pay them: 2. That the <HI>people are generally convinced,</HI> that <HI>the debt</HI> demanded is <HI>ju&s;tly due to their merits and earnings;</HI> 3. That they are <HI>willing</HI> to pay them: and, 4. That our <HI>government, or &s;u|preme council, is al&s;o willing to pay them, and vigorou&s;ly</HI> to &s;et on foot and pur&s;ue the <HI>ways and means proper to ef|fect it.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. That the country is <HI>rich enough</HI> to pay their deliverers, is too manife&s;t to admit a doubt, or need any proof. It is ea&s;ily demon&s;trated, that an additional impo&s;t on <HI>imported luxuries</HI> (&s;uch as &s;pirits, wines, &s;ilks, jewellery, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI>) but <HI>barely high enough to reduce the con&s;umption down to that moderate degree,</HI> which is really nece&s;&s;ary to the <HI>health, wealth, and morality</HI> of the inhabitants, would make our finances amply <HI>&s;ufficient</HI> to pay every &s;hilling we owe <HI>to the&s;e worthy citizens,</HI> and not this only, but al&s;o <HI>to di&s;charge every other debt which either honor, ju&s;tice, or gratitude de|mands of us.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. That our people are generally <HI>convinced</HI> that the mo|ney demanded by the&s;e worthy citizens is <HI>ju&s;tly due to them,</HI> is abundantly manife&s;t from many con&s;iderations: 1&s;t. They have <HI>di&s;cernment enough to know</HI> that a <HI>debt ju&s;tly due</HI> will always be due <HI>until it is paid.</HI> That <HI>long delay of pay|ment</HI> is no <HI>extingui&s;hment of a debt.</HI> 2d. I believe their <HI>ge|nius</HI> ri&s;es high enough to comprehend, that a <HI>debt of</HI> 20<HI>s. cannot be paid and &s;atisfied by a payment of</HI> 2<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> or, which amounts to the &s;ame thing, that <HI>the whole is greater than a part,</HI> or that 20 of any thing cannot be balanced or equaliz|ed by <HI>an eighth part</HI> of the &s;ame thing.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="329" REF="023972_0336_0FC2A88AA71CE4C8">
3. That our people at large are <HI>univer&s;ally willing</HI> to pay the&s;e worthy citizens, is al&s;o very manife&s;t.</P>
<P>1&s;t. <HI>The habits of morality are &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed on our people in general.</HI> The country is not old enough to e&s;ta|bli&s;h <HI>vice, oppre&s;&s;ion, and injury,</HI> or to obliterate the natural <HI>index of right and wrong,</HI> in the human mind: in the old countries, the <HI>luxury</HI> of an <HI>individual</HI> may con&s;ume the <HI>la|bor</HI> of <HI>thou&s;ands;</HI> a <HI>nation</HI> may be taxed and oppre&s;&s;ed to &s;upport the <HI>lu&s;t, pride, and haughty grandeur of a few;</HI> a court of inqui&s;ition may be in&s;tituted to <HI>force the mind,</HI> and <HI>infringe the rights of con&s;cience,</HI> and <HI>the people will bear it;</HI> but with us <HI>it is otherwi&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>America, oppre&s;&s;ors</HI> have not lo&s;t their <HI>&s;hame,</HI> nor the <HI>oppre&s;&s;ed</HI> their <HI>re&s;entment,</HI> nor <HI>the people</HI> their natural <HI>&s;en&s;e of good and evil;</HI> when the&s;e worthy citizens exhibit their <HI>merits and &s;ervices,</HI> &s;how their <HI>wounds,</HI> and plead their <HI>con&s;titutions and fortunes broken in the cau&s;e of their country,</HI> and <HI>cry for their pay,</HI> the general mind is in&s;tantly affected, a <HI>&s;en&s;e</HI> of both ju&s;tice and compa&s;&s;ion is &s;trongly <HI>excited,</HI> and the univer&s;al <HI>wi&s;h and murmur</HI> is, <HI>'let right be done,'</HI> and, 'why has it been &s;o long <HI>neglected and delayed?'</HI></P>
<P>2d. For the truth of the fact, I appeal to every man in the States, whether, within the circle of his acquaint|ance, there does not prevail a <HI>general pity</HI> for the &s;oldiers and other liberal &s;upporters of the war; <HI>a decided opinion and high &s;en&s;e</HI> that they have been <HI>injured and ill u&s;ed;</HI> and a &s;trong and &s;incere <HI>wi&s;h</HI> that they may be <HI>paid:</HI> as far as my acquaintance with my countrymen extends, this wi&s;h is almo&s;t univer&s;al, and if any exception can be found, I conceive it mu&s;t be among <HI>two cla&s;&s;es</HI> of people. 1. The <HI>pre&s;ent holders of alienated certificates,</HI> &s;ome of whom, I &s;uppo&s;e, wi&s;h to <HI>grab and &s;ecure</HI> to them&s;elves, the <HI>rewards</HI> due to the <HI>merits and &s;ervices</HI> of the&s;e worthy patriots. 2. The other cla&s;s are tho&s;e who always <HI>abhorred</HI> both the <HI>war</HI> and <HI>Revolution,</HI> and are therefore well enough plea&s;ed to &s;ee all tho&s;e who were concerned in <HI>promoting both the one and the other,</HI> mo&s;t effectually <HI>mortified and di&s;appointed.</HI> This leads us to con&s;ider,</P>

4. The <HI>happy facility and ea&s;e with which our &s;upreme council can adopt the mea&s;ure of paying the&s;e worthy, injured citizens,</HI> and put into mo&s;t effectual operation the <HI>ways and means</HI> nece&s;&s;ary to accompli&s;h it; nobody doubts that this is the ardent <HI>wi&s;h of their hearts,</HI> or that they will <HI>&s;peedily adopt</HI> the favorite mea&s;ure, and vigorou&s;ly &s;upport and pu&s;h it to its <HI>final effect,</HI> and thereby demon&s;trate to the world, how &s;trongly they are <HI>animated and gratified with the plea&s;ing ta&s;k</HI> of repairing the <HI>wrongs of our injured citi|zens,</HI> and re&s;toring the <HI>ju&s;tice, honor, and dignity of our country.</HI></P>
<P>By large and repeated trials of the temper of our peo|ple, we find that they will <HI>bear great pre&s;&s;ures and burdens,</HI> and will freely devote their <HI>&s;ervices and fortunes</HI> for what they deem to be the <HI>good</HI> of their country, for <HI>objects</HI> which fall in with their <HI>wi&s;hes,</HI> and meet their <HI>approbation;</HI> this temper will enable government to in&s;titute any <HI>proper modes of &s;upply,</HI> for the payment of our worthy patriots, when that very payment is the <HI>favorite wi&s;h</HI> of the people who are to pay the tax which is collected for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Two different bodies of claimants now pre&s;ent their de|mands on government; the&s;e <HI>worthy patriots</HI> are one of them; and the <HI>pre&s;ent holders</HI> of alienated certificates are the other; it will require <HI>equal &s;ums</HI> of money to pay ei|ther of them; the only que&s;tion is, <HI>which of them</HI> &s;hall have it? but I conceive, that the <HI>difficulty</HI> of rai&s;ing the money for the payment of each of the&s;e, will not be by any means <HI>equal,</HI> but <HI>extremely different.</HI></P>
<P>This brings into view another con&s;ideration, which, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of our finances, appears to me of great moment; our revenue &s;y&s;tem is <HI>young and tender,</HI> and it is of great importance to introduce the <HI>practice</HI> of it, and get it formed into a &s;ort of <HI>habit</HI> in the States as &s;oon as po&s;&s;i|ble; and this may require <HI>delicate management;</HI> if taxes are called for in <HI>ways,</HI> and for <HI>purpo&s;es,</HI> which are generally <HI>approved,</HI> the collection may be made with <HI>little difficulty and few murmurs;</HI> but if <HI>immen&s;e &s;ums</HI> of money are de|manded in ways that are <HI>di&s;gu&s;ting,</HI> and for <HI>purpo&s;es not ge|nerally approved,</HI> and perhaps <HI>abhorred,</HI> the difficulties of

collection will be <HI>great,</HI> and the <HI>murmurs, infinite;</HI> this may bring <HI>embarra&s;&s;ments</HI> on the revenue, which we may <HI>long</HI> feel very &s;ad effects of. To apply this to the ca&s;e be|fore us&mdash;</P>
<P>A large impo&s;t laid purpo&s;ely for the payment of the <HI>re|al &s;upporters of the war,</HI> will meet the <HI>approbation,</HI> and co|incide with the <HI>wi&s;hes,</HI> of the <HI>great body</HI> of our people, and, of cour&s;e, the <HI>collection</HI> will be made with <HI>ea&s;e and good humor;</HI> but let our people be told that this <HI>immen&s;e &s;um,</HI> which is levied for that favorite purpo&s;e, when <HI>carried</HI> into the trea&s;ury, is not to be <HI>given to tho&s;e favorite patriots,</HI> but is to be <HI>grabbed</HI> up by another cla&s;s of men who have no pretence to either <HI>&s;ervice or merit,</HI> but claim only what is due to the <HI>merits and the &s;ervices of the others,</HI> I con|ceive, in this ca&s;e, that all <HI>good humor</HI> will take its flight in an in&s;tant, and <HI>murmurs plenty and &s;our</HI> enough will en|&s;ue.</P>
<P>What effect &s;uch general murmurs, complaints, and di&s;|contents may have on the <HI>revenue,</HI> may be ea&s;ily fore&s;een, and I &s;hould be glad to know, that the&s;e mi&s;chiefs would <HI>end</HI> with the revenue, without <HI>extending</HI> farther to di&s;turb and derange the <HI>general police</HI> of the nation; the lea&s;t mi&s;|chief which can be expected from this general di&s;&s;atisfac|tion may be, that it will furni&s;h a plau&s;ible <HI>excu&s;e or plea for &s;mugglers and tho&s;e who wi&s;h</HI> to <HI>defraud</HI> the revenue, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that there cannot be much harm in <HI>eluding a tax</HI> which is levied for the very purpo&s;e of <HI>&s;atisfying claims,</HI> which are, in their nature, <HI>wrongful,</HI> and not grounded on any &s;uch <HI>valuable con&s;iderations,</HI> as the <HI>laws of commutative ju&s;tice</HI> make e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to the exi&s;tence of any <HI>rightful transfer of property.</HI></P>

<Q><P>THE <HI>South-Sea &s;cheme</HI> in <HI>England</HI> affords us the only in&s;tance I ever heard of in that country, of any national &s;tocks or funds, who&s;e fluctua|tion or exchange ever varied, <HI>i. e.</HI> ro&s;e or fell, &s;o much as from par to 8 for 1, or vice ver&s;a, form 8 for 1 to par.</P>
<P>National &s;tocks or funds I call them, not becau&s;e tho&s;e &s;tocks were properly <HI>public money,</HI> but becau&s;e they were of &s;uch <HI>magnitude and extent</HI> as to affect the <HI>trade and credit</HI> of the nation, and were managed under the <HI>&s;anction and protection of national authority,</HI> and controlled by the <HI>in&s;pec|tion of Parliament.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>South-Sea Company</HI> was <HI>incorporated</HI> by act of Parliament, <HI>in</HI> 1711 <HI>i. e.</HI> a great number of proprietors of <HI>navy bills, debentures, and other public &s;ecurities,</HI> were incorporated into a Company, to which was given a great variety of <HI>duties on wines, tobacco,</HI> India <HI>goods, &amp;c.</HI> to pay the <HI>an|nual intere&s;t</HI> due to them, amounting to above <HI>half a million</HI> &s;terling; and al&s;o, with this grant was joined a grant of a monopoly of the trade to <HI>Spani&s;h South-America,</HI> grounded on the <HI>A&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">nto treaty, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>This Company &s;oon grew amazingly rich, had the King and mo&s;t other capital per&s;onage for &s;tock-holders, and in 1718, <HI>his Maje&s;ty him|&s;elf</HI> was cho&s;en their <HI>Governor;</HI> at which time, the Company was become the great favorite of the court and nation, and, in 1720, were in &s;uch good condition, that 100<HI>l.</HI> &s;hare <HI>of their &s;tock</HI> was worth 130<HI>l. i. e.</HI> 30 <HI>per cent. above par.</HI></P>
<P>At this time, <HI>i. e.</HI> in 1720, the &s;cheme of reducing all the <HI>public funds into one,</HI> for di&s;charging the national debt (which, by the by, at that time was alarming enough) <HI>was &s;et</HI> on foot.</P>
<P>The <HI>South-Sea Company</HI> and <HI>Bank of England</HI> were competitors, and bid on one another for the privilege of taking in the <HI>national debts,</HI> and thereby increa&s;ing their <HI>capital &s;tock</HI> and <HI>yearly fund.</HI> The offer of the Company to Parliament for this privilege, was above 7,000,000<HI>l.</HI> &s;terling, &amp;c. which was more than the Bank would give, and, of cour&s;e, was accepted and ratified by an act of Parliament.</P>
<P>Having thus carried their point, the next thing was <HI>to go to work,</HI> and make the mo&s;t of their privilege, which was generally thought <HI>&s;o great,</HI> that their &s;tocks ro&s;e from 130 to 300<HI>l.</HI> for a &s;hare of 100<HI>l.</HI> by the time their contract with Parliament was completed.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing they had to do, was to purcha&s;e in <HI>the public &s;ecurities,</HI> which they were able to do on pretty favorable terms; for the <HI>Revolution,</HI> and the <HI>wars</HI> of King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> had rai&s;ed the national debt to about 40,000,000<HI>l.</HI> &s;terling (if I remember right) which was in tho&s;e days thought a very alarming &s;um (tho' the nation have learned better &s;ince) of cour&s;e, the credit of the public debts was &s;omewhat <HI>doubtful;</HI> and as the &s;tock of the <HI>South-Sea Bank</HI> or <HI>Company</HI> was <HI>in the fir&s;t credit,</HI> the proprietors of the public &s;ecurities thought them&s;elves <HI>hap|py to carry in and &s;ell</HI> their public &s;ecurities, on &s;uch terms as they and the Company could agree on. Above 26,000,000<HI>l.</HI> &s;terling was &s;ub&s;cribed into the <HI>South-Sea</HI> &s;tock, in this manner.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, the Company opened their books and &s;old out &s;tock to an im|men&s;e amount, and to a profit from 300 to 1000 per cent. Their fir&s;t &s;ub&s;cription was for 1,000,000 at 300<HI>l. April</HI> 12, 1720; and the &s;tock ro&s;e &s;o fa&s;t, that on the 24th of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> following, the books were opened for a &s;ub&s;cription of 1,000,000 capital &s;tock, at 1000<HI>l.</HI> for every 100<HI>l.</HI> capital &s;tock, which was filled in <HI>three hours;</HI> &s;uch was <HI>the rage</HI> for that &s;ort of &s;peculating, at that time. And, what is <HI>more amazing,</HI> after the books were clo&s;ed, in the afternoon of the &s;ame day, this <HI>&s;ame &s;ub&s;crip|tion</HI> was &s;old in <HI>Change-Alley at</HI> 30 <HI>or</HI> 40 <HI>per cent. advance.</HI></P>
<P>The ca&s;h and credits of the Company were va&s;tly accumulated by this time; and as they lent millions on intere&s;t, and &s;old mo&s;t of their &s;tocks for about 1-5th ca&s;h in hand, the re&s;t on credit at &s;everal future payments, the debts due to them were immen&s;e.</P>
<P>When the bubble bur&s;t, as it did in le&s;s than &s;ix months after, and the &s;tock the &s;ub&s;cribers had purcha&s;ed at 1000 per cent, was reduced down to about 150, and, of cour&s;e, the lo&s;s of ever &s;uch &s;ub&s;criber was 850<HI>l.</HI> out of every 1000<HI>l.</HI> &s;ub&s;cribed; I &s;ay, when this happened, legal &s;uits (of which very many were commenced) for the&s;e debts due to the Company, would have reduced mo&s;t of the monied men in the kingdom to a &s;tate of remedile&s;s bankruptcy, and the Company mu&s;t have lo&s;t mo&s;t of their money in the bargain. The public creditors had lo&s;t mo&s;t of their pub|lic &s;ecurities, which they had &s;ub&s;cribed into that fund. And infinite other mi&s;chiefs of a like nature mu&s;t have accrued, of a kind mo&s;t ruin|ous and wrong, and of an amount &s;o great as to affect national intere&s;t, honor, and credit, and of &s;uch an extreme and extraordinary nature, that no ordinary rules of law could be applied in any &s;uch manner as to afford the lea&s;t remedy, but would rather increa&s;e the evil, and give the wrong a kind of &s;anction of law.</P>
<P>In <HI>this extreme ca&s;e,</HI> the Parliament found them&s;elves under an ab&s;o|lute nece&s;&s;ity of a&s;&s;uming the powers of <HI>&s;overeign equity,</HI> and, as <HI>&s;upreme chancellors</HI> of the kingdom, to &s;uper&s;ede the ordinary <HI>rules of the law,</HI> con|trol its <HI>force,</HI> &s;often its <HI>rigor,</HI> and adopt &s;uch <HI>equitable principles,</HI> as would afford <HI>&s;ome remedy of an evil, an injury, a wrong,</HI> of &s;uch magnitude, as brought the <HI>ju&s;tice, credit,</HI> and <HI>&s;afety</HI> of the nation into danger.</P>
<P>On this principle they <HI>&s;u&s;pended law-&s;uits;</HI> annulled <HI>&s;pecial bails;</HI> di&s;|charged numberle&s;s <HI>debtors who owed for &s;tock,</HI> on paying 10 <HI>per cent. of their debts;</HI> compelled <HI>compen&s;ations</HI> in favor of the &s;ufferers; forced <HI>divi|dends and appropriations</HI> of the &s;tock of the Company; and even <HI>puni&s;hed</HI> many for mi&s;management, who &s;eemed to have conformed them&s;elves to the letter of the law, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>

<P>Very &s;trong remon&s;trances were made again&s;t the inter|ference of the legi&s;lature, and that the matter &s;hould be left to the cour&s;e of common law, <HI>i. e.</HI> to be decided ac|cording to the common rule of a&s;&s;ignments of all negotia|ble notes, bonds, &amp;c. But on a clo&s;e in&s;pection of the matter, it was &s;oon clearly &s;een, that the variation of ex|change of the&s;e &s;tocks (or their depreciation, as we call it) was &s;o <HI>enormous and extreme,</HI> that any application of the <HI>ordinary rules of law and practice</HI> to them, would produce the mo&s;t <HI>ruinous inju&s;tice and wrongs,</HI> and, of cour&s;e, eve|ry idea of <HI>that mode of &s;ettlement and adju&s;tment</HI> was in&s;tant|ly given up.</P>
<P>Their great principle was, that ju&s;tice and right was the <HI>grand end</HI> of law, and paramount to any <HI>particular rules or e&s;tabli&s;hed practice,</HI> and, of cour&s;e, ought to <HI>control them</HI> in all ca&s;es of &s;o <HI>extreme</HI> and <HI>extraordinary a kind,</HI> as could not fall within <HI>the rea&s;on on which tho&s;e rules were founded,</HI> but &s;o circum&s;tanced, as that an application of the&s;e <HI>common rules</HI> would <HI>unavoidably</HI> produce &s;uch <HI>injury and wrong,</HI> as was totally <HI>de&s;tructive of all that right</HI> which was the e&s;&s;en|tial <HI>principle and end</HI> of all law.</P>
<P>Upon full con&s;ideration of all this, by an act of <HI>&s;ove|vereignty</HI> they adopted the mo&s;t <HI>equitable principles,</HI> which they could devi&s;e in tho&s;e great confu&s;ions, which would apply to the <HI>particular ca&s;es</HI> that lay before them, and which would, in their operation, produce the <HI>mo&s;t right and avoid all wrong,</HI> in the be&s;t manner they could think of.</P>

for <HI>&s;ale or purcha&s;e of any &s;tock</HI> or &s;ub&s;cription, and al&s;o ordered that all per&s;ons, who had become <HI>indebted</HI> to the Company for South-Sea <HI>&s;tock, &amp;c.</HI> &s;hould, on <HI>pay|ment of</HI> 10 <HI>per cent. be di&s;charged</HI> from any farther demands. They made many other re&s;olutions (which were afterwards made acts of parliament) totally <HI>repugnant</HI> to the <HI>common rules of law and practice,</HI> but ab&s;olutely <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> to be adopted in tho&s;e <HI>extreme ca&s;es,</HI> to which the&s;e common <HI>rules</HI> could not be <HI>applied</HI> without the mo&s;t manife&s;t and ruinous <HI>wrongs</HI> and <HI>inju&s;tice;</HI> wrongs of &s;uch magnitude as to affect the <HI>trade</HI> and <HI>credit of the nation,</HI> as well as to bring remedile&s;s <HI>ruin on</HI> thou&s;ands of <HI>individuals,</HI> and, at the &s;ame time, heap <HI>immen&s;e fortunes</HI> on others who had never <HI>de&s;erved them.</HI></P>
<P>I know very well that great pains were taken in <HI>France,</HI> to throw much <HI>odium and blame on mr.</HI> Law, and to make him chargeable with the great and ruinous mi&s;chiefs of the <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi &s;cheme;</HI> and the &s;ame indu&s;try was u&s;ed in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> to ca&s;t <HI>blame on the directors of the South-Sea Company,</HI> and to father the pernicious con&s;equences of that &s;cheme on their corruption and mi&s;management.</P>
<P>But tho' it may be probable enough, that in &s;chemes of that va&s;t magnitude and national intere&s;t, <HI>faults in the ma|nagement</HI> might be found, which are always made to re&s;t on the <HI>prime movers and directors</HI> of them, yet the <HI>mo&s;t ca|pital and de&s;tructive mi&s;chiefs &s;prung from the nature of the &s;chemes them&s;elves,</HI> and would nece&s;&s;arily happen (tho', per|haps, not in every po&s;&s;ible exce&s;s and aggravation) if the <HI>&s;ame plans were to be &s;et on foot a thou&s;and times</HI> over.</P>
<P>But as the&s;e &s;chemes were e&s;tabli&s;hed under the <HI>&s;anction of the Legi&s;lature,</HI> in the fulle&s;t manner that could be de|vi&s;ed, it was not <HI>quite decent to admit</HI> in the national a&s;&s;em|blies, that their <HI>mi&s;chiefs flowed from their nature,</HI> but the blame mu&s;t be thrown on &s;omebody, as &s;ome <HI>&s;tupid com|mittees,</HI> in the late times, attributed the <HI>depreciation</HI> of the Continental money <HI>to the merchants.</HI></P>
<P>This, to be &s;ure, in <HI>England,</HI> was natural enough, where they adopt this principle, that when popular di&s;contents ri&s;e very high, <HI>one man mu&s;t die for the people, i. e.</HI> one or
<PB N="336" REF="023972_0343_0FC2A8A6EB02FC80">
more victims mu&s;t be &s;acrificed, like &s;cape-goats, to ap|pea&s;e the people, and thereby <HI>parry the re&s;entment</HI> due to the <HI>mini&s;ter,</HI> or <HI>prince,</HI> or <HI>Parliament,</HI> or <HI>other principal,</HI> from who&s;e <HI>folly</HI> or <HI>mi&s;conduct</HI> the mi&s;chief originally pro|ceeded; witne&s;s, admiral <HI>Byng,</HI> and many others.</P>
<P>But let the mi&s;chief originate wherever it might, the grand object of attention was <HI>a remedy,</HI> and this, doubtle&s;s, engro&s;&s;ed and occupied the whole wi&s;dom of the legi&s;latures and the re&s;pective nations, at the time; for whil&s;t their great intere&s;t, both <HI>national</HI> and <HI>individual,</HI> were rapidly melting down under the fatal influence of the&s;e <HI>de&s;tructive &s;chemes,</HI> even <HI>&s;upreme councils</HI> were willing to <HI>hearken to ad|vice;</HI> and, therefore, we may well pre&s;ume that we have an <HI>example of the mo&s;t con&s;ummate national wi&s;dom</HI> that could be collected, in the <HI>modes of remedy</HI> which they adopted.</P>
<P>Nor does any body &s;uppo&s;e that one man in <HI>England</HI> ex|pects that <HI>their national debt</HI> will ever be paid <HI>at par,</HI> tho' the pre&s;ent di&s;count or depreciation is but <HI>about 25 per cent.;</HI> or that <HI>more intere&s;t</HI> will be paid than the <HI>real value</HI> of the&s;e &s;tocks or certificates require; the <HI>pre&s;ent intere&s;t</HI> paid on them being 3 or 3&frac12; <HI>per cent.</HI> whil&s;t the <HI>common intere&s;t</HI> of that country is 5 per cent.</P>
<P>I do not pretend to refer to any thing, which might be done in the old days of barbarity and ignorance; but I do not recollect having ever heard of one modern prince or State in <HI>Europe,</HI> who ever attempted to pay <HI>his &s;oldiers or other public creditors,</HI> in <HI>certificates,</HI> or &s;tocks, or negotiable &s;ecurities of any &s;ort; except when &s;uch payment made <HI>a part of the original contract,</HI> as the contracts for navy &s;up|plies are payable in navy bills, &amp;c. All that I know, which is at all like it, is paying armies, &amp;c. with <HI>ba&s;e coin,</HI> which &s;ome princes have done; but this was a <HI>State-cheat</HI> univer&s;ally dete&s;ted; nor could all the authority of &s;uch prince ever give &s;uch ba&s;e coin a currency beyond its <HI>real value;</HI> nor did I ever hear of much it being called in and <HI>redeemed at full nominal value.</HI></P>
<P>This I take to be the practice of the nations of <HI>Europe,</HI> in ca&s;es &s;imilar to the one I am pleading; and, I think, a very little di&s;cretion on our part might induce us to imitate
<PB N="337" REF="023972_0344_0FC2A8AC96C65E38">
their prudence and virtue, profit by their example, and avoid their errors.</P>
<P>But it may, perhaps, be more important to our internal quiet, to advert to what has been the practice of our own States in &s;imilar ca&s;es; for <HI>any innovations,</HI> or <HI>departure from known u&s;age, and cu&s;toms among our&s;elves,</HI> may give more di&s;&s;atisfaction to our people, than any deviation from <HI>European</HI> practices, which, tho' perhaps <HI>equally <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;e,</HI> yet are <HI>le&s;s known</HI> and con&s;idered among us, than our own.</P>
<P>The <HI>loan-office certificates</HI> i&s;&s;ued by our own &s;upreme council during the war, are all <HI>e&s;timated by a &s;cale,</HI> the principle of which is the value of them at the time of their dates; the <HI>value of our Continental and States money</HI> has been e&s;timated by either the general <HI>&s;cale of Congre&s;s,</HI> or that of <HI>particular States;</HI> this method was indeed neglected too long, but was at la&s;t fully adopted, upon the plaine&s;t rea|&s;on and mo&s;t urgent nece&s;&s;ity; and when our <HI>Continental</HI> and <HI>State</HI> money depreciated down to nothing, <HI>it all died where it was;</HI> nobody ever thought of <HI>appreciating it</HI> again, by a redemption at its <HI>original value.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Old Tenor and other bills</HI> which had a currency in many of the States long before the Revolution, were re|deemed at their <HI>current exchange,</HI> without the lea&s;t regard to their <HI>nominal value.</HI></P>
<P>And can any po&s;&s;ible rea&s;on be given, why we &s;hould adopt <HI>an innovation</HI> (propo&s;ed and urged by many) re&s;pect|ing <HI>the certificates in que&s;tion,</HI> which is a <HI>total departure</HI> from the con&s;tant practice of all the States <HI>before, at, and &s;ince the Revolution,</HI> in all ca&s;es of <HI>&s;imilar rea&s;on; an innovation,</HI> which, by its natural and nece&s;&s;ary operation, mu&s;t and will not only produce <HI>immen&s;e and ruinous wrong</HI> to num|berle&s;s individuals of mo&s;t <HI>de&s;erving citizens,</HI> but will al&s;o di&s;grace and di&s;parage our <HI>public credit,</HI> honor, and dignity, and di&s;courage the <HI>confidence</HI> of our <HI>own citizens and fo|reigners</HI> in our <HI>national ju&s;tice and morality?</HI></P>
<P>Indeed, the <HI>ordinary rules</HI> of law would do infinite <HI>mi&s;|chief and inju&s;tice,</HI> were not the <HI>rigor</HI> of them to be <HI>&s;often|ed and corrected by chancery;</HI> the powers of chancery ought always to <HI>control the common law,</HI> whenever, in any ca&s;e,

<P><HI>Not &s;o,</HI> but in a manner <HI>widely different,</HI> will be the operation of the <HI>&s;cheme</HI> of paying the&s;e monies to the <HI>&s;peculators;</HI> about one-third of whom, I am told, are <HI>foreigners,</HI> who will carry their &s;hare of the money <HI>out of the country, never to return again;</HI> and the other two-thirds, if paid to the &s;pe|culators here, will not probably produce any general increa&s;e of <HI>circulation</HI> of money, or <HI>other benefit</HI> to the public.</P>
<P>For money obtained by <HI>&s;udden acquirement,</HI> without <HI>indu&s;try, merit,</HI> or <HI>earnings,</HI> &s;eldom proves any <HI>benefit</HI> either to the <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors</HI> or to the <HI>public,</HI> but generally produces <HI>luxury, vanity, pride,</HI> and hurtful example of <HI>prodigality and wa&s;te,</HI> till the whole is <HI>expended,</HI> and then the poor <HI>objects</HI> and <HI>their fami|lies</HI> are lo&s;t much <HI>more forlorn and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed</HI> than they would probably have been had the money never have come into their hands.</P>
<P>I think any body may ob&s;erve the very <HI>different effects and operations</HI> of the&s;e two plans, and it appears to me, that <HI>little penetration</HI> will be nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;cern that the <HI>gain</HI> lies on the &s;ide of <HI>godline&s;s;</HI> and, of cour&s;e, if we <HI>reject the right,</HI> with &s;o <HI>many benefits</HI> annexed, and <HI>adopt the wrong,</HI> with &s;uch a train of <HI>mi&s;chiefs</HI> at the heels of it, however our <HI>integrity</HI> may be unim|<HI>peached,</HI> our <HI>wi&s;dom</HI> will be <HI>doubted,</HI> and will appear to many people altoge|ther <HI>inadequate</HI> to the management of the finances of a nation.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>The&s;e are no &s;mall advantages re&s;ulting from taxation; and, I think, <HI>their effects</HI> on the nation at large will com|pen&s;ate <HI>the burden</HI> of it, and probably yield a <HI>balance of ad|vantage;</HI> e&s;pecially if the tax &s;hould be levied by an <HI>impo&s;t on imported luxuries,</HI> and thereby <HI>le&s;&s;en the con&s;umption</HI> of u&s;ele&s;s and hurtful articles; which would operate to the <HI>be|nefit</HI> of the community, even if the <HI>money</HI> produced by the tax was all <HI>thrown into the &s;ea.</HI></P>
<P>This mode of taxation may ea&s;ily be made adequate to all the exigencies of the State, and leave no occa&s;ion of re|verting to either an <HI>exci&s;e</HI> or <HI>direct taxation,</HI> both of which will be much more <HI>difficult</HI> in their a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment, more <HI>expen|&s;ive</HI> in the collection, more <HI>di&s;gu&s;ting</HI> in the mode of de|mand, more <HI>burden&s;ome</HI> to the &s;ubject, le&s;s <HI>equable</HI> in pre&s;|&s;ure, and much more <HI>uncertain</HI> in the product.</P>
<P>I now, with the utmo&s;t confidence, &s;ubmit it to the <HI>heart,</HI> to the <HI>feelings,</HI> and to the <HI>con&s;cience,</HI> of every citi|zen of the States, that I have exhibited proofs, not barely

&s;ufficient for full conviction, but &s;o plain, that any per&s;on mu&s;t put violence on him&s;elf, who will not be convinced,</P>
<P>I. That the real public creditors, who&s;e cau&s;e I am pleading, <HI>have not yet been paid;</HI> this is as plain as that 20<HI>s. is more than</HI> 2<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI></P>
<P>II. That <HI>they ought to be paid,</HI> with the fir&s;t monies we can get; this is as plain as that "the laborer is worthy of his hire," or, that contracts made on valuable con&s;ideration given, ought to be fulfilled.</P>
<P>III. That I have exhibited &s;uch a &s;tatement of our finan|ces or re&s;ources of &s;upply, as demon&s;trates that <HI>they can be paid;</HI> that the payment of them would not be <HI>a burden or di&s;tre&s;s</HI> on the country, but rather a <HI>benefit,</HI> a manife&s;t <HI>ad|vantage,</HI> to our people at large: and,</P>
<P>IV. That from mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential con&s;iderations of public ju&s;tice and honor, of national character, both abroad and at home, and of the internal peace and e&s;tabli&s;hment of our nation, it follows mo&s;t clearly, that <HI>they mu&s;t be paid.</HI></P>
<P>I do not know any thing farther nece&s;&s;ary or that can be done, but to give this E&s;&s;ay &s;ome in&s;cription, which may direct it to &s;ome <HI>particular attention;</HI> for that which is of|fered to the <HI>public at large,</HI> is generally con&s;idered as <HI>every body's bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI> and &s;o is apt to be in fact <HI>nobody's</HI> and, of cour&s;e, becomes <HI>neglected.</HI></P>
<P>As I mean, in this E&s;&s;ay, to plead the cau&s;e of national ju&s;tice, I wi&s;h to addre&s;s it to Congre&s;s, and beg the pa|tronage of that augu&s;t body;</P>

<HEAD>A REVIEW OF THE PRINCIPLES AND ARGUMENTS Of the two foregoing ESSAYS, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> The Seventh E&s;&s;ay on Finance, and The Plea for the Poor Soldiers; WITH SOME OBSERVATIONS ON THE FINANCES of the UNION.</HEAD>
<P>I. THE <HI>finances</HI> or <HI>management of the &s;tock or revenue</HI> of every State or individual, from the <HI>greate&s;t Em|pire</HI> down to the <HI>lea&s;t Republic,</HI> from the highe&s;t <HI>company</HI> to the lowe&s;t <HI>partner&s;hip,</HI> from the riche&s;t <HI>landholder</HI> or <HI>mer|chant</HI> to the poore&s;t <HI>pea&s;ant</HI> or <HI>pedlar,</HI> determines their <HI>for|tune or fate,</HI> is the <HI>great principle</HI> out of which their <HI>peace</HI> and <HI>plenty,</HI> or their <HI>embarra&s;&s;ment</HI> and <HI>&s;traits,</HI> mu&s;t grow, and from which mu&s;t proceed their <HI>final honors</HI> and <HI>&s;ucce&s;s,</HI> or their <HI>di&s;grace</HI> and <HI>ruin.</HI></P>
<P>This &s;ubject, of cour&s;e, becomes an object of mo&s;t <HI>ca|pital concern,</HI> and ought to be an object of <HI>fir&s;t con&s;ide|ration,</HI> both of every community and al&s;o of every indivi|dual.</P>
<P><PB N="345" REF="023972_0352_0FC2A8E35A4AD1D8">
Therefore, when any plan, either of political manoeuvre in a nation, or bu&s;ine&s;s in le&s;&s;er communities or individu|als, is in contemplation, <HI>to count the co&s;t</HI> becomes an indi&s;|pen&s;able part of the deliberations.</P>
<P>And when the co&s;t is properly computed or counted, the next thing is, to look out for and find <HI>revenues or incomes &s;ufficient to pay it.</HI></P>
<P>An <HI>error</HI> in either of the&s;e, <HI>i. e.</HI> a <HI>wild calculation of the expen&s;e</HI> of any propo&s;ed plan, or a wild and deficient <HI>e&s;ti|mate</HI> of the income or revenue &s;ufficient to pay it, is the common and u&s;ual <HI>cau&s;e of bankruptcy, breach of faith,</HI> and <HI>lo&s;s of credit,</HI> in both the one and the other, and of all the di&s;graces, embarra&s;&s;ments, and other ruinous con&s;equences which mu&s;t flow therefrom.</P>
<P>II. The <HI>capital &s;tock</HI> of a nation or individual <HI>is the wealth each po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es,</HI> and the <HI>re&s;ources</HI> which are with cer|tainty <HI>within their power;</HI> but the more proper and &s;afe way of computing the &s;tock is rather by the <HI>yearly income</HI> or <HI>revenue,</HI> than by the <HI>capital;</HI> becau&s;e if the annual ex|penditures exceed the annual incomes, the <HI>capital &s;tock</HI> mu&s;t be <HI>left in debt</HI> at the end of the year, which, if continued, mu&s;t &s;oon produce <HI>embarra&s;&s;ments</HI> and <HI>&s;traits,</HI> and even <HI>bankruptcy</HI> in the end.</P>
<P>It often happens that much valuable property is &s;o con|ditioned, that it will not produce any <HI>yearly income,</HI> or, at mo&s;t, not any that is adequate to the intere&s;t of its value; therefore, it would be very imprudent for a nation or indi|vidual to make calculations of <HI>yearly expenditures,</HI> grounded on <HI>&s;uch e&s;tates,</HI> for they will fail of &s;upply otherwi&s;e than <HI>by way of mortgage,</HI> which ought to be avoided as a <HI>la&s;t,</HI> becau&s;e it is a <HI>fatal, re&s;ort.</HI></P>
<P>III. But let the &s;tock or finance of a nation or individu|al be ever &s;o good and affluent, yet <HI>every advantage</HI> of it mu&s;t and ever will <HI>ari&s;e</HI> from, and be <HI>limited</HI> by, the <HI>ju&s;tice, hone&s;ty,</HI> and <HI>truth, with which it is negotiated or admini|&s;tered. Hone&s;t payment</HI> of <HI>ju&s;t debts,</HI> and <HI>fulfilment of con|tracts,</HI> are mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to give either a nation or individual the <HI>command and control of all the &s;upplies and</HI>
<PB N="346" REF="023972_0353_0FC2A8E4ED2C6078">
<HI>&s;ervices,</HI> which can be furni&s;hed within the circle of their influence.</P>
<P>For all per&s;ons will <HI>ha&s;ten with eagerne&s;s</HI> to render all &s;upplies and &s;ervices in their power to an <HI>hone&s;t, grateful payma&s;ter,</HI> and will <HI>avoid, with a proportionate reluctance,</HI> furni&s;hing either the one or the other to a <HI>di&s;hone&s;t, dila|tory, or tricki&s;h</HI> payma&s;ter.</P>
<P>And, of cour&s;e, all &s;upplies and &s;ervices, in the <HI>one ca&s;e,</HI> will be obtained in the <HI>ea&s;ie&s;t, quicke&s;t</HI> manner, and will be executed and rendered in the <HI>highe&s;t perfection</HI> (as there will be <HI>choice</HI> of materials, &s;tores, and workmen) and in the <HI>cheape&s;t way,</HI> and at the <HI>lowe&s;t rates.</HI></P>
<P>But, in the <HI>other ca&s;e,</HI> both the &s;upplies and &s;ervices will be <HI>embarra&s;&s;ed</HI> in their <HI>acquirement,</HI> will be executed and rendered in <HI>deficient manner,</HI> and at very <HI>high prices;</HI> for every one is loth to deal with a <HI>bad payma&s;ter,</HI> nor will &s;uf|fer him&s;elf to be <HI>engaged</HI> or <HI>employed</HI> by him, unle&s;s he is impelled by <HI>&s;ome urgent nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> or <HI>induced</HI> by the <HI>offer of very high price,</HI> or <HI>great emoluments.</HI></P>
<P>IV. <HI>Economy and prudence in expenditures</HI> is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the obtainment of the great <HI>advantages and be|nefits</HI> of the <HI>revenue or national &s;tock;</HI> without this, that <HI>ju&s;|tice and hone&s;ty</HI> in the management of the revenue can ne|ver be practi&s;ed, which is e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to its ends and u&s;es: for if the revenue or &s;tock is <HI>wa&s;ted</HI> by <HI>needle&s;s expen&s;es,</HI> tho&s;e which are <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> mu&s;t be <HI>unprovided</HI> for; if large, <HI>fictitious,</HI> and <HI>groundle&s;s demands</HI> are <HI>accepted</HI> and <HI>paid,</HI> debts which are by <HI>honor, contract,</HI> and <HI>real merits, ju&s;tly due,</HI> mu&s;t lie <HI>unpaid.</HI></P>
<P>This operates not only to the <HI>great injury</HI> of the <HI>real creditors,</HI> but al&s;o to the <HI>embarra&s;&s;ment</HI> of the <HI>whole commu|nity;</HI> for <HI>every branch</HI> of bu&s;ine&s;s in the nation <HI>&s;tands con|nected</HI> with the <HI>public finance,</HI> as the <HI>public debts</HI> are great and exten&s;ive objects of <HI>dependence</HI> and <HI>exchange,</HI> and, of cour&s;e, any <HI>di&s;appointment</HI> in the&s;e will generate <HI>innumerable di&s;appointments</HI> in the cour&s;e of currency thro' which they ought to pa&s;s, and, of cour&s;e, will either <HI>directly or re|motely affect</HI> every branch of bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="347" REF="023972_0354_0FC2A8E691595860">
We have had late and large proof of this kind of vexa|tion, in the numberle&s;s in&s;tances of per&s;ons who could not carry on their bu&s;ine&s;s, or pay their debts, becau&s;e they were di&s;appointed of receiving monies due to them by the public: &s;uch a mode of financiering as this will ruin any nation in the world.</P>
<P>The foregoing propo&s;itions and remarks I con&s;ider as <HI>maxims</HI> or <HI>fir&s;t principles,</HI> which force the a&s;&s;ent of the mind <HI>at fir&s;t &s;ight,</HI> by a kind of <HI>intuitive proof</HI> or <HI>in&s;tant perception,</HI> and which nobody will ever think of <HI>di&s;puting,</HI> much le&s;s of <HI>denying;</HI> I therefore premi&s;e them like <HI>axioms,</HI> on which I may &s;afely proceed to build <HI>any doctrines or plans</HI> which really re&s;t on the&s;e foundations, or come within their e&s;&s;ential principles and rea&s;ons.&mdash;I go on now with my Review of the Principles and Arguments of the two foregoing E&s;&s;ays.</P>
<P>The great principles of the two foregoing E&s;&s;ays are compri&s;ed in the following propo&s;itions:</P>
<P>I. <HI>That all certificates delivered to the public creditors, ought to be placed to the debit of their account, at the value or ex|change of them at the time they received them,</HI> and the <HI>remain|der or re&s;idue of the debt due to them, ought to be paid to them with intere&s;t:</HI> and that <HI>all certificates,</HI> when brought into the trea&s;ury, <HI>ought to be paid to the bearer,</HI> whether an <HI>origi|nal holder or alienee,</HI> at the <HI>value or exchange, which each of them bore at the time of its date,</HI> or at the <HI>current exchange at the time of redemption,</HI> as the ca&s;e may require. If this can|not be admitted, my &s;econd propo&s;ition is,</P>
<P>II. To pay <HI>all certificates brought in by the original holders,</HI> at <HI>full nominal value, with intere&s;t;</HI> and to pay <HI>all the alien|ated certificates</HI> at the <HI>value or exchange they bore at their dates,</HI> or at the <HI>time of redemption,</HI> as the ca&s;e may require. If this cannot be admitted, I propo&s;e,</P>
<P>III. That the <HI>original holders be fir&s;t paid,</HI> and the <HI>&s;pecu|lators, la&s;t of all,</HI> if they mu&s;t be paid at all.</P>
<P>The great principle or &s;ub&s;tance of my argument is, that <HI>the public money ought to be paid to the real, original creditors,</HI> who, by rendering <HI>&s;upplies and &s;ervices</HI> to the country, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>really, meritoriou&s;ly, and painfully earned it:</HI> for,</P>

Their demand is founded on the <HI>mo&s;t &s;olemn contract of Congre&s;s,</HI> who had <HI>good right to make &s;uch contract,</HI> which <HI>binds the honor, the morality, and ju&s;tice of the country,</HI> and nothing but <HI>payment</HI> can di&s;charge the country from the <HI>guilt of inju&s;tice,</HI> and <HI>violation of faith</HI> and <HI>truth</HI> mo&s;t <HI>&s;o|lemnly</HI> plighted to them.</P>
<P N="2">2. They <HI>fulfilled</HI> the whole of &s;aid &s;olemn contract vir|tuou&s;ly, hone&s;tly, and very painfully <HI>on their parts,</HI> and therefore, on every principle of <HI>merit</HI> and <HI>earning, are en|titled</HI> to their <HI>pay.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>infinite benefits</HI> we derive from that <HI>contract</HI> and their faithful <HI>fulfilment</HI> of it, afford <HI>another argument</HI> why we &s;hould pay them: we cannot <HI>hone&s;tly</HI> enjoy the <HI>benefit</HI> of any <HI>man's labor,</HI> without paying him his <HI>hire;</HI> it is to the &s;upplies and &s;ervices of the&s;e men, that we are indebted for <HI>our country, our lives, our e&s;tates, our liberty,</HI> and <HI>our in|dependence,</HI> and all the ble&s;&s;ings of a <HI>free government,</HI> un|controlled and unbia&s;&s;ed by any <HI>foreign</HI> power or influence; and it ought not to be thought <HI>po&s;&s;ible,</HI> that &s;uch an <HI>Ame|rican government,</HI> which derives its <HI>exi&s;tence</HI> from the <HI>exer|tions,</HI> the <HI>travails,</HI> and <HI>per&s;evering virtue</HI> of the&s;e <HI>patriots,</HI> &s;hould, by a public act, <HI>deny</HI> them their <HI>pay,</HI> their <HI>hire,</HI> their <HI>reward,</HI> for merits which have been &s;o <HI>beneficial</HI> to us, and <HI>painful</HI> to them; or &s;hould &s;uffer <HI>any how</HI> the <HI>public mo|ney,</HI> carved out of the wealth and earnings of our citizens for the <HI>very purpo&s;e</HI> of paying the&s;e worthy patriots, to be <HI>diverted</HI> from this de&s;irable object, or to be <HI>applied</HI> to any <HI>other</HI> purpo&s;e whatever.</P>
<P N="4">4. The heart-moving and unparallelled di&s;tre&s;&s;es of very <HI>many thou&s;ands</HI> of the&s;e worthy patriots for <HI>want of their pay,</HI> is another cogent rea&s;on why they &s;hould <HI>be paid:</HI> I do not &s;ay, that the <HI>benefits</HI> we receive from their merits, or the <HI>di&s;tre&s;&s;es</HI> they &s;uffer from our breach of faith and pro|mi&s;e in denying them their pay, <HI>increa&s;e</HI> or <HI>alter</HI> the <HI>&s;tipula|tions of their contract;</HI> but both have a <HI>&s;trong effect</HI> on the <HI>gratitude,</HI> the <HI>benevolence,</HI> and <HI>compa&s;&s;ion</HI> of the human mind, which are virtues of &s;uch <HI>precious</HI> and <HI>primary</HI> con|&s;ideration in &s;ociety, that, I think, no government ought to be <HI>callous</HI> to their <HI>influence,</HI> or <HI>hardened</HI> into an <HI>in&s;en&s;ibi|lity</HI>

<HI>of their force.</HI> We all think it wor&s;e to refu&s;e a la|borer his hire, when he and his family mu&s;t <HI>&s;tarve and pe|ri&s;h</HI> for want of it, than to deny payment of an equal &s;um to a rich man, who had an <HI>equally ju&s;t demand,</HI> but who&s;e fortune would enable him to bear the lo&s;s <HI>without pain.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. The&s;e original creditors have <HI>not yet been paid,</HI> but in <HI>&s;mall</HI> part, and therefore the <HI>remaining balance</HI> is &s;till due to them, and <HI>ought</HI> to be paid. Nobody pretends they have ever received <HI>any payment</HI> but <HI>negotiable certificates</HI> made payable to the <HI>bearer,</HI> and worth on average, when they received them, about 2<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d. in the pound;</HI> the&s;e certifi|cates, I &s;ay, ought to be debited to them at <HI>their value or current exchange</HI> when they <HI>received</HI> them; <HI>&s;o much</HI> they have received, and <HI>no more;</HI> and the re&s;idue of balance due to them ought to be paid to them.</P>
<P>I have attended to all the debates on this great &s;ubject, both public and private, which have fell in my way, but I do not recollect one per&s;on who ever &s;eriou&s;ly in&s;i&s;ted, that the certificates delivered to the public creditors were <HI>full payment of the debt due to them;</HI> but this notwith&s;tanding, I have heard <HI>many objections,</HI> &s;illy and nugatory enough, &s;trongly urged again&s;t making any further payment to tho&s;e who had &s;old their certificates.</P>
<P N="1">1. One was, that if they had not &s;old their <HI>debt,</HI> they had &s;old the <HI>evidence of it,</HI> and &s;o could have <HI>no further de|mand;</HI> this is <HI>not true;</HI> the <HI>evidence</HI> of the debt is <HI>the pub|lic books,</HI> where their accounts are <HI>adju&s;ted,</HI> and the <HI>balance</HI> due to them is <HI>entered;</HI> and nothing can ju&s;tly be objected to this but &s;ome evidence that the debt <HI>has been paid;</HI> which evidence, the <HI>certificate,</HI> if produced, could not &s;upply. Further, the <HI>certificate,</HI> if produced, could not be &s;o <HI>good</HI> evidence as the <HI>public books,</HI> for the one might be <HI>counter|feit,</HI> the other <HI>could not be:</HI> &s;uppo&s;e a man brings &s;uit on a <HI>record,</HI> of which he has &s;ome time or other taken a copy, and produces the <HI>record</HI> in court; can it be objected to his recovery, that he has <HI>not produced the copy?</HI> Or, if a man brings &s;uit on a contract, and has <HI>three</HI> witne&s;&s;es to it, <HI>two</HI> of which he produces, who fully verify the fact; &s;hall he
<PB N="350" REF="023972_0357_0FC2A8F7CC22F6D0">
lo&s;e his cau&s;e, becau&s;e he did not call in the <HI>third wit|ne&s;s?</HI></P>
<P>The public creditor who demands his pay, mu&s;t doubt|le&s;s bring <HI>evidence &s;ufficient</HI> to &s;upport his &s;uit, <HI>i. e.</HI> the <HI>proof will lie upon him,</HI> and if he can, in any way, <HI>verify the facts,</HI> and <HI>&s;upport his right,</HI> he doubtle&s;s <HI>ought to be paid.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Another objection has been made, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that <HI>all</HI> the original creditors who &s;old their certificates, were not <HI>dri|ven by nece&s;&s;ity</HI> to do this; and what if they were not? can there be any <HI>crime</HI> or <HI>di&s;qualification</HI> in &s;elling a negotiable certificate, made payable to the <HI>bearer,</HI> and purpo&s;ely <HI>cal|culated,</HI> like bills of money, for <HI>negotiation</HI> and <HI>currency</HI> thro' <HI>any</HI> and <HI>every</HI> hand?</P>
<P N="3">3. It has been objected, that <HI>&s;ome</HI> original creditors &s;old their certificates thro' <HI>diffidence of the public faith.</HI> And what if they did? Do you think they were <HI>&s;ingular</HI> in their diffidence? Suppo&s;e any man wants confidence in his debtor, and <HI>fears or doubts</HI> that he &s;hall lo&s;e his debt; Can that affect the <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> of his demand, or his <HI>right to payment?</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Another objects to <HI>any further payment,</HI> becau&s;e <HI>&s;ome</HI> of the creditors who &s;old their certificates for 2<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> in the pound, had <HI>managed their</HI> 2<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d. &s;o well</HI> by a &s;even years' negotiation, as <HI>to make</HI> 20<HI>s. out of it.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. Another objects, that <HI>many</HI> of the public creditors were of &s;uch a <HI>di&s;&s;ipating turn,</HI> that if they were paid the whole 20<HI>s.</HI> due to them, they would &s;oon <HI>&s;pend</HI> it, and, of cour&s;e, would be <HI>no better</HI> but rather <HI>wor&s;e</HI> off, than if they had never been paid.</P>
<P>Now, gentlemen-readers, &s;uppo&s;e any private debtor &s;hould be &s;ummoned into court, at the &s;uit of his creditor, for a debt of 20<HI>s.</HI> and he &s;hould &s;how <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> he had, &s;even years ago, paid his creditor 2<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> of the debt of 20<HI>s.</HI> and plead <HI>any or all the foregoing objections</HI> again&s;t any further payment of the 17<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> which remained due; can you imagine that the court would allow &s;uch plea to be good in <HI>law or equity,</HI> and <HI>&s;ufficient to di&s;charge</HI> the debtor from any <HI>further payment?</HI> And if the&s;e <HI>pleas</HI> and <HI>objections</HI> &s;hould
<PB N="351" REF="023972_0358_0FC2A8FF863055D8">
appear trifling and ridiculous in a <HI>private concern,</HI> can you bring your&s;elves to believe they would receive any addition|al weight or dignity from being introduced by any mo&s;t dignified per&s;onage, and urged in the mo&s;t augu&s;t a&s;&s;embly on earth, again&s;t paying <HI>public creditors</HI> circum&s;tanced in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>But the <HI>great objection</HI> &s;till remains, the <HI>clincher</HI> that is to &s;upport the whole plan, and &s;o connect the parts together, as to make the whole con&s;i&s;tent with <HI>law, rea&s;on, right,</HI> and <HI>ju&s;tice;</HI> for certainly no plan can be ju&s;tified, which has not all the&s;e qualities. This capital objection to pay|ing the original creditors, who have &s;old their certificates, the balance of the debt, which has never been paid to them, is this, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>
<P>They have <HI>&s;old their certificates,</HI> and thereby <HI>conveyed to the purcha&s;er all their right</HI> to their demand or debt due to them. As much &s;tre&s;s is laid on this objection, it requires a particular con&s;ideration.</P>
<P N="1">1. If the public promi&s;e or faith is <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed to be given</HI> in the certificate, it was <HI>broken the in&s;tant it was made;</HI> it was <HI>violated in the very birth of it;</HI> it was <HI>verbal</HI> only, not <HI>real;</HI> the <HI>words</HI> expre&s;&s;ed the <HI>nominal</HI> value, but the <HI>reality</HI> or <HI>meaning</HI> &s;unk down in&s;tantly to the <HI>current value,</HI> by the very <HI>con&s;truction</HI> which Congre&s;s it&s;elf fixed, by their &s;cale, on like words in the loan-office certificates, and under this con&s;truction they pa&s;&s;ed, by univer&s;al con&s;ent of buyer and &s;eller, from hand to hand.</P>
<P>The <HI>wrong</HI> was <HI>in&s;tantly</HI> done to the original creditor, and he in&s;tantly &s;u&s;tained the <HI>injury</HI> and <HI>damage,</HI> and, con|&s;equently, if any thing is to be done in future time to compen&s;ate or repair that damage, it ought <HI>&s;o to be done,</HI> that he who <HI>&s;uffered</HI> the <HI>injury</HI> and <HI>damage,</HI> may receive the <HI>benefit</HI> of it; making this compen&s;ation to a <HI>&s;tranger,</HI> who &s;uffered nothing, is no <HI>repair of the wrong done,</HI> is no &s;ort of <HI>re&s;toration</HI> of injured right, and is, of cour&s;e, nu|gatory and ridiculous.</P>
<P N="2">2. But, in real truth, if the public faith was de&s;igned to be really plighted at all, it was annexed to the <HI>debt,</HI> not to the <HI>certificate;</HI> the debt was founded on the <HI>merits or</HI>
<PB N="352" REF="023972_0359_0FC2A90B74A1D0E0">
<HI>valuable con&s;iderations out of which it grew,</HI> and to the&s;e it adheres, and carries with it the promi&s;e or public faith which is annexed to it.</P>
<P>The <HI>certificates</HI> and the&s;e <HI>merits</HI> are very widely different things; the one <HI>depreciated to</HI> 2<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> in the pound; the other <HI>kept their value</HI> without the lea&s;t diminution; the one was <HI>transferred;</HI> the other <HI>was not.</HI> The &s;peculators can produce the <HI>certificates,</HI> but they cannot produce the <HI>merits,</HI> of the original creditors: the&s;e they never bought or paid for, and, therefore, can have no right or claim to them, or the rewards of them, <HI>i. e.</HI> to the debt annexed to them; for it is impo&s;&s;ible that one man &s;hould have a <HI>right</HI> to the <HI>labor</HI> or <HI>hire</HI> of another, without paying a <HI>valuable con&s;ide|ration</HI> for it; if it was even <HI>agreed to be transferred without this,</HI> the transfer would be <HI>void</HI> as a <HI>nudum pactum,</HI> not on|ly by the <HI>laws of the land,</HI> but by the immutable <HI>laws of commutative ju&s;tice.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The certificate was never either delivered to, or receiv|ed by, the original creditor, as <HI>full payment of the debt</HI> due to him, and therefore never <HI>compri&s;ed or carried in it that debt;</HI> nor is it pretended or pleaded by any body as any thing more than the <HI>evidence</HI> of that debt; and, of cour&s;e, if the debt can be &s;ufficiently <HI>proved by the public books,</HI> or any other evidence, the want or ab&s;ence of the certificate can be no objection to the claim of the original creditor.</P>
<P N="4">4. The certificate, when fir&s;t delivered to the public creditor, being made payable to the bearer, and expre&s;sly fitted and calculated for circulation or exchange, like other bills of public credit, compri&s;ed and carried in it <HI>&s;ome va|lue</HI> as long as it could be &s;old, but, like all other articles of negotiation or exchange, that value was <HI>liable to varia|tion</HI> according to the <HI>ri&s;e</HI> or <HI>fall</HI> of the market.</P>
<P>From the two la&s;t propo&s;itions it clearly follows, that when the certificate was &s;old, all the <HI>value</HI> which it com|pri&s;ed or carried in it was &s;old and transferred with it, and <HI>no more;</HI> and of cour&s;e, the purcha&s;er, by the &s;ale, be|came entitled to that <HI>value,</HI> and <HI>no more:</HI> the re&s;t of the debt &s;taid behind, and &s;tuck fa&s;t to the original merits out of which it originally grew, and in the place where it al|ways
<PB N="353" REF="023972_0360_0FC2A90CCD7501E0">
belonged, <HI>i. e.</HI> the original creditor, by the &s;ale of his certificate, &s;old and granted all that he received, and no more; and that part which he had not received, he retained, and has a right to call for and receive, whenever he plea&s;es.</P>
<P N="5">5. A reference to the <HI>real de&s;ign of Congre&s;s</HI> in i&s;&s;uing the certificates, e&s;pecially at the clo&s;e of the war, may ca&s;t &s;ome light on this affair. We are not to &s;uppo&s;e that con|gre&s;s i&s;&s;ued negotiable certificates <HI>for</HI> 40,000,000 <HI>of dol|lars,</HI> worth but 2<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> or &s;ome &s;uch trifle, in the pound, with <HI>real, &s;erious de&s;ign</HI> to load the nation with the immen&s;e burden of redeeming them at 20<HI>s. in the pound,</HI> wholly for the benefit of the <HI>bearers;</HI> by far the greate&s;t part of whom, they had every rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, would be <HI>&s;trangers</HI> not only to the <HI>merits,</HI> out of which the debt certified original|ly grew, but to <HI>any &s;uch &s;ervices,</HI> or even <HI>kind wi&s;hes,</HI> for our country, as could de&s;erve the public notice; and many of them <HI>&s;trangers</HI> to the country it&s;elf.</P>
<P>We never ought to impute bad intentions, e&s;pecially to public bodies of dignity, where their actions will equally well bear a favorable con&s;truction. I think, we are rather bound in charity to &s;uppo&s;e, that, as Congre&s;s found the public trea&s;ury &s;o exhau&s;ted that it was impracticable to make even a &s;mall, partial payment to the public creditors, they might think that negotiable certificates would &s;ell for <HI>&s;omething,</HI> which, tho' little, might be better than <HI>nothing,</HI> and afford <HI>&s;ome relief,</HI> till the country could recover a little from the ruins of the war, and arrange the finances into &s;ome productive &s;tate, which would &s;upply funds &s;ufficient for full payment; and that, in the mean time, they might &s;afely tru&s;t to the wi&s;dom of a future Congre&s;s, to adopt modes of redemption of &s;uch certificates, either &s;imilar to their own &s;cales then in e&s;tabli&s;hed practice, or &s;ome other which might do <HI>ju&s;tice to all,</HI> or at lea&s;t &s;omething near it, and bring <HI>ruin on nobody,</HI> nor even di&s;appoinment; for &s;uch a limited redemption was expected by every body at that time.</P>
<P>They had been long accu&s;tomed to i&s;&s;ue public paper with the public faith plighted in <HI>words expre&s;&s;ive and &s;olemn enough,</HI> which yet, by their own &s;cales and by general ac|ceptation, were reduced, <HI>in con&s;truction</HI> or <HI>meaning,</HI> down
<PB N="354" REF="023972_0361_0FC2A90E10661EC0">
to the <HI>current value</HI> or <HI>exchange</HI> which their paper obtained; and when they i&s;&s;ued the certificates in que&s;tion, I have no doubt but they con&s;idered them&s;elves merely <HI>pur&s;uing their long u&s;age or practice,</HI> and conceived that the <HI>public paper they then i&s;&s;ued,</HI> with all the <HI>re&s;t</HI> that preceded it, would, in time, find and meet &s;ome rea&s;onable mode of liquidation and final redemption, <HI>tolerable to all,</HI> and <HI>ruinous to none.</HI></P>
<P>In this view of the matter, tho' the means they adopted may not be deemed <HI>altogether proper</HI> (and perhaps, under the public pre&s;&s;ures and nece&s;&s;ities which then exi&s;ted, no means could be hit on <HI>wholly free</HI> from exception) yet their <HI>intentions</HI> may be admitted to be <HI>ju&s;t, &s;alutary, and bene|volent,</HI> and agreeable to the <HI>general expectation.</HI></P>
<P>Whereas, on the other hand, to &s;uppo&s;e them <HI>deliberate|ly</HI> loading the States with a debt of 40,000,000 of dollars, for only 5,000,000 which they received and had the bene|fit of, is <HI>mon&s;trous,</HI> which becomes &s;till more <HI>hideous,</HI> if this horrible plan was <HI>de&s;ignedly</HI> &s;o formed that, by its na|tural operation, it would, in the end, cut all &s;uch of the original creditors who took benefit of it, off from 7-8<HI>ths</HI> of their <HI>pay or the debt certified</HI> to be due to them. But,</P>
<P N="6">6. To &s;uppo&s;e that the whole debt due to the original creditors is compri&s;ed in their certificates, and transferred by the &s;ale of them to the purcha&s;ers, by the common rule of a&s;&s;ignments, I &s;ay, this &s;uppo&s;ition will demon&s;trably prove either that the common rule of a&s;&s;ignments is <HI>wrong</HI> and <HI>bad</HI> in it&s;elf, or <HI>wrongly applied</HI> to this ca&s;e: but <HI>wrong in it&s;elf</HI> it is not; for it is plainly enough very good and u&s;eful <HI>in its place, i. e.</HI> within its due <HI>mean</HI> and <HI>rea&s;on;</HI> therefore, in the ca&s;e in que&s;tion, the application is <HI>wrongful, i. e.</HI> the rule will not admit a rea&s;onable <HI>application to the facts,</HI> on which its operation is demanded.</P>
<P>For <HI>every law divine and human,</HI> every practicable <HI>rule of morality or &s;ound policy,</HI> is and mu&s;t mo&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be <HI>founded on ju&s;tice and right,</HI> and, in its application, mu&s;t <HI>produce ju&s;tice and right,</HI> and <HI>avoid injury and wrong;</HI> there|fore, whenever any law or rule, however <HI>&s;acred in it&s;elf,</HI> is applied <HI>to any facts or ca&s;e</HI> to which it &s;o <HI>ill &s;uits,</HI> that its nece&s;&s;ary and unavoidable operation will be to <HI>de&s;troy</HI>
<PB N="355" REF="023972_0362_0FC2A90F93B1E690">
<HI>right</HI> and <HI>ju&s;tice,</HI> and to produce <HI>wrong and injury,</HI> the application is certainly wrongful: in &s;uch ca&s;e, the true u&s;e and meaning of the rule is <HI>mi&s;taken</HI> or <HI>perverted.</HI></P>
<P>All laws of every country are &s;o capable of application to ca&s;es which are out of their rea&s;on, that a Court of <HI>Chancery</HI> makes a part of every judiciary &s;y&s;tem; the au|thority and duty of which is to <HI>control and &s;often</HI> the <HI>extreme rigor</HI> of the law; and when any &s;tatute or other rule is of &s;o high authority that the powers of the court, do not ex|tend far enough to give relief, application is and ought al|ways to be made to the <HI>&s;upreme authority, which is ever the &s;upreme chancery of the State,</HI> to <HI>repeal</HI> &s;uch law, or <HI>explain</HI> and <HI>limit</HI> its true meaning, and <HI>correct</HI> the errors and wrongs of it.</P>
<P>Now to apply the foregoing po&s;ition (which certainly no man will controvert) to the ca&s;e before us&mdash;The opinion in di&s;pute, 'that the &s;ale of a certificate transfers the whole debt certified, to the purcha&s;er, by the <HI>common rule of a&s;|&s;ignments,' cannot be true,</HI> becau&s;e this would nece&s;&s;arily involve and imply <HI>great wrong</HI> and <HI>inju&s;tice,</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> it would take away the <HI>rewards due to the merits</HI> and <HI>earnings</HI> of our mo&s;t meritorious citizens, and give the monies <HI>due to them</HI> to <HI>another cla&s;s</HI> of people, who are not entitled to any of it <HI>by any kind of valuable con&s;iderations, merits,</HI> or <HI>earnings</HI> whatever, <HI>i. e.</HI> it would cut the original public creditors, who, by their merits and &s;ervices, <HI>&s;upported the war and &s;av|ed their country,</HI> off from the <HI>rewards,</HI> the <HI>pay,</HI> the <HI>hire</HI> due to them, and <HI>give the &s;ame to the &s;peculators,</HI> who never <HI>&s;erv|ed</HI> or <HI>&s;aved</HI> the country, and to whom <HI>we owe</HI> nothing.</P>
<P>This takes the <HI>public money to an immen&s;e amount,</HI> from a va&s;t number of mo&s;t de&s;erving citizens, &s;cattered thro' eve|ry part of the Empire, who have <HI>dearly and mo&s;t virtuou&s;ly earned</HI> it, and have <HI>never been paid,</HI> and many of whom, with their families, for want of their pay, are now &s;uffer|ing the <HI>pangs of ruin and extreme di&s;tre&s;s,</HI> and <HI>all</HI> &s;uffer <HI>great</HI> inconvenience and di&s;appointment; I &s;ay, from the&s;e worthy, unhappy objects it takes the <HI>public money due to their earnings,</HI> and gives it to <HI>&s;peculators,</HI> who have never <HI>earned any of it.</HI></P>

No man ever adopted that plan, but he found the <HI>gro&s;s, but un|avoidable, final inju&s;tice</HI> of it a great difficulty, <HI>hard to be got over;</HI> and this final inju&s;tice proves as plainly that the plan which involves it, is <HI>wrong,</HI> as that any effect indicates the nature of its cau&s;e, or that that which <HI>does or works wrong,</HI> is <HI>wrong:</HI> of cour&s;e, there is an <HI>error in the matter</HI> &s;o very gro&s;s and important as to be <HI>fatal in &s;ociety.</HI> Society can|not exi&s;t, if the laws of it will not &s;ecure <HI>to the laborer his hire,</HI> or to the <HI>virtuous the rewards of his virtue,</HI> or to the <HI>indu&s;trious the fruits of his indu&s;try.</HI></P>
<P>In fine, the facts under that plan &s;tand glaring thus: the original creditors claim their pay by <HI>&s;olemn, public con|tract,</HI> by <HI>dear earnings,</HI> and <HI>mo&s;t virtuous merits;</HI> they have <HI>not been paid;</HI> the <HI>money due</HI> to them is carved out of the <HI>labors of the nation,</HI> in order to <HI>pay them;</HI> they can get <HI>none of it,</HI> are finally <HI>cut off from it,</HI> and the <HI>&s;peculators</HI> are to <HI>get it all,</HI> without the lea&s;t <HI>claim</HI> of <HI>merit, &s;ervices,</HI> or <HI>va|luable con&s;ideration paid</HI> for it.</P>
<P>The&s;e facts mu&s;t be either <HI>di&s;proved</HI> or <HI>avoided</HI> (which cannot be; they are of the mo&s;t public <HI>notoriety</HI>) or the <HI>ab&s;urdities</HI> and <HI>injuries</HI> re&s;ulting from them mu&s;t be <HI>&s;wal|lowed</HI> and <HI>dige&s;ted</HI> (Good Heaven! what throats and &s;to|machs men mu&s;t have to do this!) or the <HI>plan</HI> mu&s;t be <HI>given up.</HI></P>
<P>Many people puzzle them&s;elves to find where the error or wrong lies: &s;ome &s;ay, <HI>in the breach of the public faith;</HI> &s;ome &s;ay, <HI>in the original i&s;&s;uing the negotiable certificates;</HI> others &s;ay, <HI>in the folly of the &s;eller, &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> but I &s;hould think it very ea&s;y to &s;ee that the error lies in &s;uppo&s;ing that <HI>property can be transferred by implication,</HI> without any <HI>inten|tion</HI> of the &s;eller, and without any <HI>valuable con&s;ideration</HI> paid for it.</P>
<P>But it matters little <HI>where</HI> the error or wrong lies; it is quite enough to know that <HI>it really exi&s;ts,</HI> and will <HI>produce</HI>

<HI>its baneful effects,</HI> and is of &s;uch <HI>magnitude</HI> as to affect the <HI>e&s;&s;ential intere&s;ts of the nation,</HI> and will do &s;o for <HI>ages to come;</HI> and, therefore, as &s;oon as the error is di&s;covered, it ought immediately to be <HI>corrected or remedied:</HI> the <HI>national &s;afe|ty, peace,</HI> and <HI>pro&s;perity</HI> require this.</P>
<P>If we <HI>&s;ow</HI> all over the nation <HI>errors and wrongs,</HI> they may be <HI>unnoticed</HI> at fir&s;t, but will &s;oon <HI>&s;pring up</HI> and <HI>grow</HI> into a <HI>fore&s;t of chagrin</HI> and <HI>di&s;content,</HI> of <HI>wretchedne&s;s</HI> and <HI>ruin.</HI> Nothing can give peace and e&s;tabli&s;hment to a na|tion, equal to <HI>'judgment</HI> and <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> running down its &s;treets, and <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> overflowing it.'</P>

<P N="1">1. The plan I <HI>oppo&s;e</HI> pays the immen&s;e &s;um of public mo|ney given by the nation purpo&s;ely to <HI>reward the &s;aviours</HI> of their country, pays this money, I &s;ay, to the <HI>&s;peculators,</HI> who never <HI>earned any of it,</HI> who do not pretend to found their claim to it on any <HI>merits,</HI> or <HI>&s;ervices,</HI> or <HI>valuable con|&s;ideration,</HI> which they ever rendered to the <HI>nation</HI> or <HI>any body el&s;e,</HI> but demand the compen&s;ations and rewards <HI>due to the original creditors,</HI> without <HI>pretending</HI> to have paid any <HI>valuable con&s;ideration</HI> therefor to them; and at the &s;ame time, the plan denies tho&s;e immen&s;e rewards to tho&s;e <HI>wor|thy citizens,</HI> who found their claim thereto on <HI>the mo&s;t &s;a|cred contract of Congre&s;s</HI> to them, under <HI>&s;anction</HI> of the <HI>pub|lic faith,</HI> which <HI>binds the country "by the laws of</HI> GOD <HI>and man;"</HI> on the mo&s;t <HI>punctual fulfilment</HI> of &s;aid contract, on <HI>their part;</HI> and on <HI>their great virtue and merit,</HI> in <HI>&s;aving their country</HI> in its mo&s;t <HI>dreadful danger</HI> and <HI>di&s;tre&s;s:</HI> if any body thinks there is any <HI>honor, ju&s;tice,</HI> or <HI>right</HI> in this plan, let him look for it, and I believe he will ea&s;ily find all that <HI>is there.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The plan I <HI>propo&s;e</HI> is, to <HI>debit the original creditors</HI> with all the <HI>certificates they received,</HI> at <HI>their current value</HI> at the time of their <HI>dates,</HI> and pay the <HI>remaining balance</HI> due to them <HI>with intere&s;t;</HI> and to redeem the <HI>certificates</HI> by pay|ment to the <HI>bearer,</HI> let him be either <HI>original holder</HI> or <HI>alienee,</HI>
<PB N="359" REF="023972_0366_0FC2A923CA2D1A40">
at the <HI>&s;ame rate,</HI> or at their <HI>current exchange</HI> at the time of redemption, as the ca&s;e may require.</P>
<P>This plan pays the immen&s;e public monies to the people who <HI>earned</HI> them, <HI>i. e.</HI> to tho&s;e who, by &s;olemn, <HI>public contract,</HI> and by their <HI>real &s;upplies</HI> and <HI>&s;ervices</HI> rendered as the <HI>conditions</HI> of that contract on <HI>their part,</HI> are mo&s;t <HI>ju&s;tly</HI> and <HI>&s;ub&s;tantially entitled</HI> to them; and, at the &s;ame time, pays to the <HI>&s;peculators</HI> the <HI>proper value</HI> of the certificates which they have purcha&s;ed.</P>
<P>This plan, I think, will do the <HI>mo&s;t general ju&s;tice</HI> to the citizens at large, which can be done by imperfect human wi&s;dom, in the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances of the matter. This will <HI>place</HI> the public monies <HI>where they belong,</HI> will give eve|ry one <HI>his due,</HI> and <HI>no more than his due.</HI> This will bring, on one &s;ide, <HI>wrong and ruinous di&s;tre&s;s on nobody;</HI> nor will it, on the other, heap <HI>unmerited, unearned fortunes on any body.</HI> This will, <HI>in the end, do manife&s;t ju&s;tice and right to every one.</HI> This ought ever to be our goal, whatever <HI>confu|&s;ion, doubt,</HI> and <HI>darkne&s;s</HI> may ari&s;e from the chaos of <HI>&s;ubtile arguments, dexterity</HI> of management, and <HI>artful di&s;gui&s;ing</HI> and <HI>twi&s;ting of facts,</HI> thro' which we may be forced to make our way in our pa&s;&s;age on to this realm of <HI>ju&s;tice, truth, and light:</HI> for whatever dark and gloomy pa&s;&s;ages we may have occa&s;ion to pa&s;s thro', in the deliberation and adju&s;tment of human concerns and di&s;putes, <HI>final ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>right</HI> ought ever to be the &s;tar that <HI>directs</HI> our &s;teps, and which will certainly <HI>guide</HI> us to the <HI>rightful i&s;&s;ue</HI> at la&s;t.</P>
<P>I cannot &s;ee that this plan will bear hard on more than <HI>two</HI> &s;orts or de&s;criptions of men, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>
<P N="1">1. Such public creditors who have <HI>real merits</HI> and <HI>ju&s;t right</HI> to a claim, but, by &s;ome means, may not be able to <HI>prove</HI> their right; and probably, among the infinite number of real public creditors, there may be <HI>&s;ome</HI> of this &s;ort, and perhaps <HI>many,</HI> who mu&s;t &s;uffer without remedy; for what <HI>cannot be proved,</HI> cannot be <HI>admitted</HI> in any court in the world; but then it is to be noted, that the <HI>plan I oppo&s;e</HI> leaves the&s;e &s;ufferers as <HI>much unprovided for,</HI> and as much <HI>de&s;pe|rate and without remedy,</HI> as the plan I <HI>propo&s;e,</HI> and, of
<PB N="360" REF="023972_0367_0FC2A92B1EC712F8">
cour&s;e, this objection lies with <HI>equal weight</HI> again&s;t <HI>both</HI> plans, if it is of any weight again&s;t either of them.</P>
<P N="2">2. The &s;econd &s;ort of men who may think my plan impo&s;es hard&s;hip on them, are &s;uch &s;peculators as have purcha&s;ed their certificates at a <HI>higher exchange</HI> than that at which I propo&s;e to redeem them; but this lo&s;s or hard|&s;hip (if it is any) is and always mu&s;t be <HI>incident</HI> to &s;uch &s;peculations, which, at be&s;t, are but <HI>games at hazard,</HI> alto|gether <HI>u&s;ele&s;s,</HI> barely <HI>tolerable,</HI> and often very <HI>hurtful</HI> to the public: I do not, therefore, conceive their lo&s;s or gain de|&s;erves any con&s;ideration in the public deliberations or de|ci&s;ions of this great que&s;tion, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>what rate or &s;cale of re|demption</HI> of certificates, <HI>Continental money, or any other public paper,</HI> does the <HI>general ju&s;tice,</HI> and <HI>national honor,</HI> and &s;afe|ty of our country, <HI>require?</HI> But if we were to allow that the lo&s;&s;es and hard&s;hips of the&s;e men were <HI>real</HI> and <HI>pitiful,</HI> they bear not the <HI>lea&s;t proportion</HI> to the infinite <HI>hard&s;hip</HI> and <HI>ruinous di&s;tre&s;&s;es,</HI> to which the plan I oppo&s;e &s;ubjects countle&s;s <HI>thou&s;ands</HI> of our mo&s;t <HI>de&s;erving</HI> citizens; even if the calculation is made on either the <HI>numbers, amount of lo&s;s,</HI> or the <HI>merits,</HI> of the &s;ufferers.</P>
<P>If this alternative cannot be avoided, it can admit no doubt but the <HI>le&s;&s;er</HI> mu&s;t yield to the <HI>greater;</HI> for it is cer|tainly a le&s;s evil to incur the lo&s;s of a <HI>penny</HI> than a <HI>pound,</HI> or even to do <HI>inju&s;tice</HI> to <HI>one</HI> man than to a <HI>thou&s;and;</HI> and of two evils we ought to choo&s;e the lea&s;t.</P>
<P>But the morality of the two plans, <HI>i. e.</HI> the degree of <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>right,</HI> or of <HI>injury</HI> and <HI>wrong,</HI> which their ope|ration will naturally produce, is not the only thing which ought to govern our choice of them; there is a mo&s;t im|portant <HI>difference</HI> both of <HI>facility of collection</HI> and <HI>utility of payment,</HI> under them. For,</P>
<P>I. Under the plan I propo&s;e, the public money paid will be <HI>&s;cattered</HI> over the <HI>whole nation,</HI> thro' every part where the real public creditors will be found; and the money &s;o paid will,</P>
<P N="1">1. Do an act of <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> long due to the receiver:</P>
<P N="2">2. Will increa&s;e the <HI>bu&s;ine&s;s</HI> of the country; as mo&s;t of the creditors will be thereby enabled to go into or increa&s;e
<PB N="361" REF="023972_0368_0FC2A92C0E277D48">
their bu&s;ine&s;s, who are now <HI>re&s;trained</HI> and <HI>held back,</HI> thro' want of their &s;tock withheld from them by the public.</P>
<P N="3">3. This money will immediately &s;pread thro' every part of the nation, and cau&s;e a great increa&s;e of <HI>circulation,</HI> which will give <HI>&s;pirit</HI> and <HI>facility</HI> to the general indu&s;try and wealth of our people at large; and as the taxes are all ultimately paid by the con&s;umers, who are &s;pread over every part of the country,</P>
<P N="4">4. The <HI>facility of collection</HI> of the &s;econd tax will grow out of the <HI>operation of the fir&s;t,</HI> as the payments will be made more <HI>ea&s;y</HI> and <HI>&s;atisfactory</HI> thereby; for the people will naturally grow <HI>contented</HI> under a tax, when they per|ceive <HI>advantages ari&s;ing</HI> out of the <HI>increa&s;ed circulation</HI> of ca&s;h produced by it, enough to compen&s;ate the <HI>burden</HI> of the tax.</P>
<P>II. But under the plan I oppo&s;e, the ca&s;e will be <HI>great|ly otherwi&s;e;</HI> for,</P>
<P N="1">1. One <HI>third</HI> of the &s;peculators are &s;uppo&s;ed to be <HI>fo|reigners,</HI> and, of cour&s;e, their third of the money paid (&s;ay, 7 or 8,000,000 of dollars) will be <HI>&s;ent</HI> directly <HI>out of the country, never to return</HI> again; <HI>this drain</HI> of ca&s;h by an|nual intere&s;t (for nobody thinks of paying the principal) when added to <HI>that</HI> of the foreign debt, is enough (if we had no other drains) to keep the country <HI>poor, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed,</HI> and <HI>behind hand</HI> for ages to come.</P>
<P N="2">2. The other two-thirds paid to the &s;peculators here, will not be &s;cattered over the country, and increa&s;e the <HI>ge|neral circulation,</HI> but will be <HI>accumulated in few hands,</HI> mo&s;t of which, according to the common cour&s;e of human pa&s;|&s;ions, will be applied to make and &s;upport <HI>nur&s;eries of vice, luxury, pride, vanity, di&s;&s;ipation,</HI> and <HI>bad example:</HI> for for|tunes obtained by <HI>&s;udden</HI> acquirement, without any <HI>merits</HI> or <HI>earnings,</HI> are u&s;ually &s;pent in this way; and if a few of them &s;hould happen to employ their money prudently, it will <HI>&s;o far</HI> contribute to <HI>accumulating the national wealth into few hands,</HI> which is one of the wor&s;t things that can happen to a nation.</P>
<P>III. Another difference of the operation of the two plans will have great effect on the <HI>revenue.</HI> When the
<PB N="362" REF="023972_0369_0FC2A936EC5D8F28">
public money is paid for purpo&s;es of <HI>acknowledged ju&s;tice, utility,</HI> and <HI>general advantage,</HI> the payment of taxes will be made without <HI>murmur,</HI> and the collection, of cour&s;e, will be <HI>ea&s;y</HI> and <HI>without di&s;turbance.</HI> Paying to the original cre|ditors the <HI>hire of their labors,</HI> the <HI>debt</HI> due to them for ex|ertions that <HI>&s;aved their country,</HI> is a method of employing the public money of mo&s;t <HI>acknowledged propriety</HI> thro' the nation; but the payment of &s;peculators is not &s;o popular; it is <HI>hard</HI> for people to &s;ee the fruits of their labor taken from them, and given to &s;peculators who never earned any of it.</P>
<P>This will naturally make the taxes <HI>odious;</HI> and, of cour&s;e, the <HI>burden</HI> of the <HI>old</HI> taxes, the <HI>in&s;tituting of new ones,</HI> and the <HI>collection of both,</HI> will &s;oon become objects of general <HI>unea&s;ine&s;s, murmur,</HI> and <HI>ill-humor;</HI> which, when <HI>general,</HI> will be ea&s;ily blowed up into <HI>tumults, in&s;urrections,</HI> and a general <HI>derangement</HI> of the peace and political order of &s;o|ciety; &s;muggling and other avoidances of the taxes may not be the mo&s;t alarming of the&s;e national frets.</P>
<P>In a nation thus tempered, a few m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n of &s;pirit, and en|terpri&s;e, who may happen to be <HI>di&s;gu&s;ted, &s;oured with male|volence,</HI> and <HI>fired with thir&s;t of revenge,</HI> may do infinite mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>Without the aid of any &s;uch incendiaries, I am per&s;uad|ed beyond a doubt, that any tax to <HI>pay the &s;peculators</HI> will &s;it <HI>very unea&s;y</HI> on the mo&s;t <HI>quiet</HI> and <HI>peaceable</HI> citizens that can be found among us.</P>
<P>I was lately in conver&s;ation with a gentleman of <HI>great fortune,</HI> and noted for a very <HI>generous</HI> and <HI>peaceful temper,</HI> who told me he had ju&s;t been paying an impo&s;t of about 30 dollars for wines he imported for his own u&s;e, and ad|ded, <Q>had it been to pay <HI>our &s;oldiers</HI> and <HI>other &s;upporters of the war,</HI> I &s;hould not have begrudged it, had it been <HI>three times</HI> as much; but the thought that it mu&s;t <HI>go to the idle &s;peculators,</HI> makes my <HI>blood boil</HI> in my veins:</Q>&mdash;and I conceive, every hone&s;t <HI>American</HI> that earns his own money, feels ju&s;t &s;o.</P>
<P><HI>Taxes</HI> are ever ranked among the mo&s;t <HI>te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hy articles of civil police,</HI> and require very <HI>delicate</HI> management; and our
<PB N="363" REF="023972_0370_0FC2A93C8A903170">
revenue-&s;y&s;tem is <HI>very young, tender,</HI> and not ripened enough into <HI>firm, general habit;</HI> and, tho' in its infancy, it is pre&s;&s;ed with a much <HI>heavier load</HI> than the country ever felt before; I therefore conclude, that any plan that <HI>tends to embroil the finances,</HI> and furni&s;h <HI>objections</HI> and <HI>murmurs</HI> again&s;t the <HI>re|venue,</HI> ought to be <HI>reprobated</HI> as the mo&s;t <HI>dangerous</HI> and <HI>fa|tal</HI> mea&s;ure that can be devi&s;ed.</P>
<P>IV. There is another objection to the plan I <HI>oppo&s;e,</HI> which I con&s;ider very great, and which, I think, is obvi|ated by the one I <HI>propo&s;e,</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> it encourages and &s;upports <HI>idle and hurtful arts and contrivances</HI> to procure <HI>fortunes</HI> by <HI>dexterity</HI> and <HI>&s;leight of hand,</HI> rather than by the <HI>old, painful methods of indu&s;try, economy,</HI> and <HI>care.</HI> The&s;e &s;peculators all have for their <HI>object,</HI> the <HI>acquirement</HI> of wealth without <HI>earning</HI> it, <HI>i. e.</HI> of getting the <HI>hire</HI> and <HI>rewards</HI> due to the <HI>labor</HI> and <HI>merits of another,</HI> into their own <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion</HI> and <HI>en|joyment, without any retribution:</HI> this therefore is, in its na|ture and principle, wrongful; and people of this ca&s;t com|monly &s;pend their <HI>&s;tock and time</HI> in the&s;e pur&s;uits, which, otherwi&s;e, they would employ in <HI>u&s;eful occupations</HI> of hu&s;|bandry, manufactures, or trade; and, of cour&s;e, &s;o much good <HI>&s;tock and time is lo&s;t</HI> to the public.</P>
<P>I think, this &s;ort of &s;peculations ought not to be con&s;i|dered as <HI>merely u&s;ele&s;s,</HI> but <HI>hurtful al&s;o,</HI> and, therefore, ought by no means to be <HI>encouraged and &s;upported</HI> by any mea&s;ures of government; e&s;pecially when their <HI>exce&s;s</HI> has been carri|ed to &s;uch an <HI>enormous pitch,</HI> as to draw after it the <HI>ruinous con&s;equences</HI> de&s;cribed above, and obvious to every di&s;cerning eye.</P>
<P>V. My next objection to the plan I oppo&s;e, ari&s;es from <HI>the general &s;tate of the finances of the nation,</HI> which I beg leave to introduce, with &s;ome previous ob&s;ervations by way of preface.</P>
<P N="1">1. I am not <HI>alarmed at a heavy national debt;</HI> much le&s;s do I apprehend any <HI>de&s;truction</HI> or <HI>ruin</HI> from it, if not too enormous; nor,</P>

<P>From this &s;tatement it appears, that the whole <HI>pre&s;ent revenue</HI> is le&s;s than <HI>two-fifths of the yearly expenditures;</HI> a little more than <HI>two-fifths</HI> of it are ab&s;orbed by the civil li&s;t and intere&s;t of the <HI>foreign debt,</HI> and about <HI>two-thirds of the remainder</HI> are appropriated to pay the <HI>clear profits or gains of the &s;peculators,</HI> and the debts due to the original creditors come in for the other third, but by &s;uch an <HI>unequal</HI> di&s;tri|bution, that far the <HI>greate&s;t</HI> part of them <HI>get nothing at all,</HI> and tho&s;e who do come in for <HI>&s;omething,</HI> get but <HI>two-thirds</HI> of the debt confe&s;&s;ed by every body to be due to them.</P>
<P>For the truth of this &s;tatement I appeal to the <HI>public books, e&s;timates, calculations, and records,</HI> except <HI>my e&s;timate</HI> of the exchange or value of certificates, which is a matter of public <HI>notoriety,</HI> and I leave any body to <HI>correct it, who can.</HI></P>
<P>Out of this &s;tatement, I think, ari&s;es a very &s;trong ob|jection again&s;t the <HI>plan I oppo&s;e.</HI> I think it is manife&s;tly wrong, e&s;pecially in the <HI>di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;traits and deficiency</HI> of the revenue, to be&s;tow 26,000,000 of the living funds which the revenue can &s;upply, <HI>on the &s;peculators,</HI> who never paid any thing for it, either to the nation, or to the original creditors, whil&s;t there remains due to &s;aid creditors a debt of <HI>above</HI> 50,000,000, which is not only <HI>unpaid,</HI> but totally <HI>unprovided for;</HI> and e&s;pecially when it is con&s;idered, that this <HI>neglected debt</HI> is originally founded on the mo&s;t <HI>&s;olemn, public contract,</HI> and the mo&s;t <HI>faithful</HI> and <HI>painful fulfilment</HI> of it on <HI>the part</HI> of the creditors.</P>
<P><PB N="367" REF="023972_0374_0FC2A95001EA0168">
I do not at pre&s;ent advert to any but the following que&s;|tions, that can ari&s;e on this &s;tatement of the public debt and the exi&s;ting revenue.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t que&s;tion to be con&s;idered is,&mdash;whether this &s;tate|ment is <HI>wild</HI> and <HI>ideal</HI> only, or <HI>really true</HI> and grounded on <HI>&s;uch facts as will &s;upport it?</HI> For my part, I have not any particular knowledge of the facts on which it is grounded, and, of cour&s;e, do not object to any of it, except that part which <HI>adopts the clear gains of the &s;peculators</HI> into the public debt, and <HI>loads</HI> the nation with the <HI>burden of</HI> 26,000,000 <HI>dollars</HI> to pay them, and <HI>of</HI> 800,000 <HI>more,</HI> to rai&s;e the old Continental money out of the <HI>grave</HI> where it has quietly <HI>&s;lept</HI> more than &s;even years.</P>
<P>The &s;econd que&s;tion which offers it&s;elf is,&mdash;whether any part of the public debt, included in the above &s;tatement, can be <HI>reduced, docked off,</HI> or <HI>thrown out?</HI> There are but two items which, I conceive, can admit a doubt in this que&s;tion:</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is,&mdash;<HI>the</HI> 26,000,000 <HI>dollars</HI> appropriated to the payment of the <HI>clear gains</HI> of the &s;peculators. This, I think, ought to be <HI>rejected</HI> for all the rea&s;ons a&s;&s;igned above.</P>
<P>The &s;econd is,&mdash;the balance of the, &s;ame &s;um due to the original creditors. I think (whatever may be decided as to <HI>paying</HI> or <HI>rejecting</HI> the clear gains of the &s;peculators) this item of the &s;tatement ought <HI>to be admitted and paid,</HI> for all the rea&s;ons above urged, and this additional one, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the <HI>character</HI> of the <HI>nation abroad</HI> for <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>honor,</HI> requires this.</P>
<P>For let us &s;uppo&s;e that one of our emba&s;&s;adors at a fo|reign court &s;hould, in &s;ome grand circle, happen to ha|rangue a little on the <HI>ju&s;tice, honor,</HI> political con&s;titution, &s;trength, riches, and ble&s;&s;ings of his country, and &s;ome grave man, with much meaning in his countenance, &s;hould reply to him&mdash;<Q>Sir, all you &s;ay of the <HI>ble&s;&s;ings</HI> of your country, may be true for any thing I know; but it &s;eems to me, the <HI>ju&s;tice and honor of it are not quite &s;o clear,</HI> for I think I have heard that your Congre&s;s <HI>refu&s;ed to pay to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e noble and patriotic citizens,</HI> who, with their <HI>blood</HI>

and <HI>travail, purcha&s;ed</HI> for you <HI>all the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings</HI> you bea&s;t of, the <HI>rewards,</HI> the <HI>&s;imple hire</HI> due to them by the mo&s;t <HI>&s;acred, public contract</HI> that could be made, and <HI>faithfully fulfilled on their part,</HI> by exertions and &s;ervices, the mo&s;t <HI>noble, arduous, painful,</HI> and <HI>per&s;evering,</HI> of which we have any example in hi&s;tory.</Q></P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, you would not wi&s;h to &s;ee our emba&s;&s;ador <HI>da&s;hed out of countenance, pocket the affront,</HI> and <HI>&s;link into a corner:</HI> but if you think &s;ome reply nece&s;&s;ary to <HI>bring him off,</HI> and as he may not have one ready cut and dried at hand, I wi&s;h any of you who oppo&s;e this payment, would make a <HI>&s;uitable one for him,</HI> that he may be proper|ly armed at all points to defend the <HI>honor</HI> of this country, whenever it may be <HI>in&s;ulted or attacked.</HI></P>
<P>Third que&s;tion. As the pre&s;ent revenue amounts to le&s;s than two-fifths of the yearly expenditures, according to the above &s;tatement, the next que&s;tion is,&mdash;can the <HI>revenues be increa&s;ed up to the amount of the nece&s;&s;ary annual expenditures? i. e.</HI> can the <HI>duties</HI> or <HI>taxes</HI> be <HI>rai&s;ed</HI> up to <HI>three-fifths higher</HI> than they <HI>now are?</HI> I conceive this will be <HI>difficult</HI> in the <HI>a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment,</HI> and more &s;o in the <HI>collection;</HI> indeed, it appears to me <HI>totally impracticable,</HI> as things &s;tand at pre&s;ent; and the idea of <HI>deferring</HI> payment, and <HI>loading</HI> the nation with an in&s;talment to be paid <HI>ten years hence,</HI> brings to my mind a young rake, who bought a hor&s;e, and agreed to pay for it <HI>"at the next election,"</HI> but &s;urreptitiou&s;ly drew the note payable <HI>"at the re&s;urrection;"</HI> the creditor applied for pay|ment; the rake plead that the time was not come; on which the creditor applied to his <HI>father,</HI> who was a grave, &s;erious man; he called his &s;on, and a&s;ked why he did not pay the debt; the &s;on replied, that it was not yet due, as he would &s;ee by the note; the father replied, <Q>Ah! young man, pay the debt in&s;tantly; I fear, at the rate you go on, you will have enough to an&s;wer for <HI>at the re&s;urrec|tion,</HI> without this note again&s;t you.</Q></P>
<P>Fourth que&s;tion. If the revenue is not adequate to full payment, ought not the <HI>actual payments</HI> to be made by <HI>divi|dends,</HI> payable to every creditor in <HI>equal proportions</HI> of the debt due? In &s;uch ca&s;e, to pay <HI>part</HI> of the creditors <HI>half</HI>
<PB N="369" REF="023972_0376_0FC2A9699210BD98">
<HI>or two-thirds</HI> of their demand, and <HI>nothing</HI> to the <HI>re&s;t,</HI> is contrary to the mo&s;t received <HI>rule of di&s;tributive ju&s;tice,</HI> in all ca&s;es of private <HI>bankruptcies</HI> or <HI>&s;toppages of payment,</HI> and I can &s;ee no rea&s;on why the &s;ame rule &s;hould not extend to the <HI>deficiencies</HI> of the <HI>public revenue.</HI></P>
<P>Fifth que&s;tion. If the public revenues are deficient, ought <HI>any creditor at all to be paid any thing,</HI> till the whole debt is <HI>liquidated</HI> and reduced to a <HI>certainty,</HI> without which it is impo&s;&s;ible to make the requi&s;ite dividends? A <HI>negative</HI> an&s;wer to this que&s;tion &s;eems to be &s;o clearly ju&s;t and pro|per, that I cannot conceive that it will be di&s;puted.</P>
<P>But after all, if the fir&s;t propo&s;ition of my plan above urged cannot be admitted, and the <HI>final deci&s;ion</HI> mu&s;t be, that the original creditors who have <HI>&s;old</HI> their certificates, have, by the &s;ale, <HI>extingui&s;hed their demand</HI> for any <HI>further</HI> payment; that no evidence of the debt can be admitted, but certificates; and <HI>no payment</HI> of the debt certified in them, can be allowed and made to any body but the <HI>holders</HI> of them (all which appears to me to be &s;trange doctrine) I beg leave, if this mu&s;t be the ca&s;e, to introduce my &s;e|cond propo&s;ition, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>
<P>That all <HI>original holders</HI> of certificates <HI>be paid the full no|minal value of their certificates, principal and intere&s;t;</HI> and that all <HI>alienated certificates</HI> be paid to the <HI>bearer</HI> at the <HI>rate, value or current exchange they had at their dates,</HI> or at the <HI>time of redemption,</HI> as the ca&s;e may require, <HI>i. e.</HI> &s;o that no certificate &s;hall be redeemed at <HI>a higher value or exchange than it bore at the time of its date,</HI> or (if, after its date, it depreciated) at no <HI>higher exchange</HI> than &s;hall be its <HI>current value</HI> at the <HI>time</HI> of redemption; for the public never re|ceived any <HI>valuable con&s;ideration for it, more than its value</HI> at the time of its <HI>date,</HI> and therefore never ought to pay <HI>any more to redeem it;</HI> but if it has <HI>depreciated</HI> thro' the cour&s;e of its currency or circulation, the <HI>public</HI> has paid that <HI>depreciation once already,</HI> for it operates by way of <HI>tax on the innumerable hands</HI> in which it depreciated, <HI>i. e.</HI> on the <HI>public,</HI> thro' which it circulated; and there can be no rea|&s;on why the <HI>public</HI> &s;hould pay the <HI>&s;ame lo&s;s over again;</HI> and if they &s;hould do this, it would be no <HI>reparation</HI> to the <HI>&s;uf|ferer;</HI>
<PB N="370" REF="023972_0377_0FC2A96B509C6930">
for, at the time of doing this, the certificate would not be in the <HI>&s;ame hands which &s;uffered by the depreciation?</HI> but this argument is more fully di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in the preceding E&s;&s;ays, where the doctrine of <HI>appreciation</HI> and <HI>depreciation</HI> is often called up and con&s;idered.</P>
<P>The certificates are <HI>evidence</HI> of the debt certified, in the hands of the <HI>original holder,</HI> and my propo&s;ition is, to pay it to him: but in the <HI>hands of the alienee</HI> it carries not any <HI>&s;uch evidence,</HI> for it is plain enough, both in <HI>fact</HI> and <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> that, by the &s;ale of the certificate, nothing more was ei|ther <HI>transferred by the &s;eller,</HI> or <HI>expected</HI> or <HI>paid for by the purcha&s;er,</HI> than the <HI>chance</HI> or <HI>right</HI> of receiving &s;uch <HI>&s;um</HI> or <HI>value</HI> for it, as the Congre&s;s &s;hould <HI>&s;et</HI> or <HI>fix</HI> as the <HI>price</HI> or <HI>exchange</HI> at which it &s;hould be <HI>finally redeemed:</HI> and this <HI>rate</HI> or <HI>&s;cale</HI> of redemption ought to be &s;et or e&s;timated with|out the lea&s;t regard to the <HI>lo&s;s</HI> or <HI>gain</HI> of the &s;peculators; but on <HI>principles of general ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>right only, i. e.</HI> in &s;uch manner as will do <HI>mo&s;t right</HI> and <HI>lea&s;t wrong, i. e.</HI> in &s;uch manner, that <HI>no de&s;cription</HI> of citizens &s;hould be <HI>more bene|fited or hurt,</HI> or made <HI>richer</HI> or <HI>poorer,</HI> by it, than <HI>another;</HI> for all national <HI>di&s;tributions</HI> of ju&s;tice, all public <HI>in&s;titutions</HI> and <HI>deci&s;ions</HI> whatever, ought always to be &s;o made, that both the <HI>burdens</HI> and <HI>benefits</HI> of them may fall <HI>equably</HI> on all, and not lie <HI>more heavily</HI> or <HI>more beneficially</HI> on <HI>one</HI> than <HI>another, i. e.</HI> &s;o that every one &s;hall participate his <HI>clear</HI> and <HI>proportionable &s;hare</HI> both of the <HI>burden</HI> and <HI>benefit</HI> of them.</P>
<P>The rate or &s;cale of redemption, thus e&s;timated and fix|ed, will manife&s;tly pay to the &s;peculator all that he has right to receive, <HI>i. e.</HI> all that he ever bought or paid for; and if the overplus may not be paid to the original credi|tor, let it be retained in the trea&s;ury, and be paid to no|body; for I cannot &s;ee the u&s;e of paying it at all, where it is not due.</P>
<P>This propo&s;ition (which I advanced five years ago in my <HI>Seventh E&s;&s;ay on Finance)</HI> gave ri&s;e to the great que&s;tion of <HI>di&s;crimination</HI> between <HI>original holders</HI> and <HI>purcha&s;ers</HI> of cer|tificates, and has been &s;o fully di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, that little need be added in this Review of the Arguments.</P>
<P><PB N="371" REF="023972_0378_0FC2A96C93937980">
Perhaps it may be enough to ob&s;erve, that mo&s;t of the <HI>oppo&s;ers</HI> of the propo&s;ition acknowledge the <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> of it, but object to it at <HI>impracticable.</HI> But I can &s;ee very little weight in the objection; every one who claims as an <HI>origi|nal</HI> holder, mu&s;t <HI>di&s;criminate him&s;elf, i. e.</HI> the <HI>proof will lie on him</HI> that he is <HI>&s;uch.</HI> I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, that his <HI>name</HI> in|&s;erted in the certificate, and his <HI>affidavit</HI> that he has never <HI>alienated</HI> it, would be &s;ufficient. If the certificate was ta|ken out for <HI>his benefit</HI> in the <HI>name</HI> of another (as perhaps has been often done) the <HI>balance due on the public books,</HI> and, the certificate <HI>debited</HI> to him, with his own <HI>affidavit,</HI> would make the matter clear enough; be&s;ides, the <HI>negotiator</HI> of &s;uch a matter would be a good witne&s;s.</P>
<P>There is no more danger of <HI>perjuries</HI> in this ca&s;e, than there is in oaths to original entries on <HI>books of accounts,</HI> to <HI>&s;ignatures, &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> After all, there can be but very few ca&s;es, if any, where the plan I <HI>oppo&s;e</HI> can give any <HI>more</HI> or <HI>better remedy</HI> to creditors who have lo&s;t their proofs, than the one I <HI>propo&s;e</HI> affords.</P>
<P>My la&s;t propo&s;ition is,&mdash;if neither of the above-men|tioned two can be admitted, that the <HI>original holder</HI> &s;hall be <HI>fir&s;t paid,</HI> and the <HI>&s;peculator la&s;t of all,</HI> if he mu&s;t be <HI>paid at all.</HI> The rea&s;on is, becau&s;e the debt of the <HI>original</HI> holder is founded on <HI>greater merits</HI> and <HI>real earnings</HI> than the other, and, therefore, ought to be con&s;idered as of a <HI>higher</HI> and <HI>more worthy nature,</HI> and, of cour&s;e, ought to be <HI>preferred</HI> in payment.</P>
<P>Upon the whole matter, I have <HI>no conception</HI> that the pre|&s;ent arrangement of the public finances, <HI>i. e.</HI> of receipts and payments, is by any means <HI>adequate to the exigencies of the nation.</HI> I cannot form any idea, that our revenue either <HI>is or can be made &s;ufficient</HI> to &s;upport the <HI>immen&s;e load</HI> of debt which lies upon it: nor can I conceive how any nation can exi&s;t without the <HI>utmo&s;t deficiencies, di&s;gra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> and <HI>even bank|ruptcy,</HI> where the drafts on the revenue &s;o greatly exceed the annual incomes of it; can exi&s;t, I &s;ay, without running over head and ears into the horrible gulf, the unbounded chaos of derangement, which will draw into it every con|ceivable embarra&s;&s;ment, not only of the public revenue,

<P><HI>Deferring payments to future time</HI> is but putting <HI>far away the evil day,</HI> and avoiding the pain of <HI>pre&s;ent pre&s;&s;ures,</HI> at the expen&s;e of <HI>future embarra&s;&s;ment.</HI> The unavoidable con|&s;equence of an over-loaded revenue will be a <HI>deficiency of the public payments, i. e.</HI> a <HI>failure</HI> of the <HI>public credit,</HI> and of the ju&s;tice and honor of the nation.</P>
<P>But in our own ca&s;e, this is not <HI>all our calamity;</HI> for, under all this pre&s;&s;ure of taxes, we can derive little <HI>im|provement</HI> of our country, or even <HI>&s;afety</HI> and <HI>&s;ecurity,</HI> from them: this immen&s;e <HI>gulf of debt</HI> &s;wallows up all our <HI>reve|nues,</HI> and is by no means <HI>&s;atisfied with them all;</HI> it leaves us not a <HI>&s;hilling</HI> fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>public roads, inland navigation, encou|ragement of agriculture, manufactures,</HI> or <HI>genius</HI> of any &s;ort, or even for <HI>defence</HI> again&s;t <HI>enemies</HI> or <HI>pirates,</HI> in ca&s;e of a war; all the navy of the nation is not &s;ufficient to &s;uppre&s;s a <HI>pilot-boat,</HI> if it &s;hould be armed and manned by <HI>pirates</HI> to <HI>in&s;ult</HI> and <HI>infe&s;t</HI> our coa&s;ts.</P>
<P>But this is not all; our people have not the <HI>benefit</HI> of that <HI>increa&s;ed circulation</HI> of ca&s;h, which would ari&s;e from the heavy taxes they do pay, if the payments were made to creditors <HI>&s;cattered over</HI> the nation, who would in&s;tantly circulate the money they received, among the <HI>&s;ame people</HI> from whom it had been <HI>collected;</HI> but our money goes to <HI>&s;trangers,</HI> or to &s;uch <HI>accumulations,</HI> that it is carried off far beyond our reach for ever, after we have paid it in taxes.</P>

<P>Either to <HI>reduce the debt</HI> by <HI>docking off &s;ome part</HI> of it, or to <HI>increa&s;e the revenue</HI> up to an amount &s;ufficient to pay it: the <HI>latter</HI> I take to be utterly <HI>impracticable</HI> and <HI>de&s;perate,</HI> as the matter now &s;tands; the <HI>other,</HI> I think, might be done. The <HI>only part</HI> of the e&s;timate of the national debt that is
<PB N="373" REF="023972_0380_0FC2A9794EB0E510">
not for the nation's <HI>benefit,</HI> is the 26,000,000 <HI>dollars</HI> appro|priated to pay the <HI>clear profits</HI> of the &s;peculators. This, I think, might be <HI>&s;pared out of the e&s;timate,</HI> but as it is fund|ed, I think it cannot be well docked off without a REPEAL <HI>of the funding act,</HI> which I <HI>humbly wi&s;h may take place.</HI> I know there would be <HI>great difficulties</HI> in doing this, but I conceive there will be much greater difficulties in not doing it. I am confident, the act, when it begins to operate, will be found, in its nature, wrong and impracticable, and nece&s;|&s;ity will compel the re&s;cinding it &s;ooner or later, and it is much ea&s;ier to correct a new error than an old one; it is more honorable to correct an error with readine&s;s of mind on fir&s;t conviction, than to wait for the &s;evere compul&s;ions of nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>But if the repeal of the act &s;hould be thought improper, perhaps a &s;upplement fixing a rea&s;onable rate or &s;cale of exchange at which the certificates and Continental money &s;hall be received into the new loan, might prove a very &s;alutary amendment of it: and if I could believe that any thing le&s;s than the nation's <HI>well-being</HI> made this repeal or amendment nece&s;&s;ary, I &s;hould be &s;ilent about it.</P>
<P>Any attempt to pay this va&s;t &s;um twice over, would draw con&s;equences the mo&s;t de&s;tructive and ruinous that can be conceived; and if both cannot be paid, and we cannot avoid the alternative, I would prefer &s;acrificing a demand which never <HI>originated</HI> in <HI>real merit or earnings,</HI> but receives its <HI>whole force</HI> from an <HI>extravagant implication</HI> of a <HI>meaning</HI> in words, which, by con&s;truction of <HI>&s;peaker</HI> or <HI>hearer</HI> at the time of utterance, was <HI>never compri&s;ed</HI> or <HI>conveyed</HI> in them; I &s;ay, I would prefer this to any <HI>violation</HI> of the <HI>&s;olemn con|tract;</HI> the <HI>&s;acred public vows, &s;ealed</HI> and <HI>plighted</HI> to the <HI>ori|nal</HI> creditors, in the time of our country's <HI>utmo&s;t danger</HI> and <HI>deep di&s;tre&s;s,</HI> and to who&s;e <HI>faithful</HI> and <HI>painful fulfilment</HI> of that <HI>contract on their parts,</HI> we are <HI>indebted</HI> under GOD for <HI>our deliverance.</HI></P>
<P>If the fir&s;t part of this alternative can be adopted, our de&s;peration may cea&s;e, the great difficulty will dimini&s;h, partly becau&s;e a large and the mo&s;t exceptionable part of the burden will be taken off, and partly becau&s;e what is
<PB N="374" REF="023972_0381_0FC2A97AC5E1A550">
left will be a debt of &s;uch acknowledged and uncontroverted right, ju&s;tice, and honor, as will give courage and force to our councils to a&s;&s;e&s;s, and our people to bear, &s;uch bur|dens of tax as will be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport it, and gradually to wipe it off.</P>
<P>It is human to err, but it is the decided mark of &s;trong intellects and a generous temper, to acknowledge and correct an error on conviction; yet &s;uch is the common weakne&s;s of the human mind, that error is often con|nected with ob&s;tinacy; tho&s;e who are weak enough to make mi&s;takes, are rarely wi&s;e enough to correct them; and the hard nece&s;&s;ity which compels an amendment of an error, will not always produce an acknowledgment of it. The &s;tability of public mea&s;ures and deci&s;ions ought to re&s;t on their rectitude and natural fitne&s;s, not on an ob&s;tinacy that is blind to their faults. Every body acknow|ledges that it is honorable and noble to own and correct an error, and that it is mean and ba&s;e to per&s;i&s;t in one; yet mo&s;t men feel a &s;ort of degrading &s;hame, when they are called upon to correct their own mi&s;takes. I hope our public councils are not affected with any of the&s;e little feelings: but, be it &s;o or not, it is commonly true, that errors adopted on long deliberation are not ea&s;ily given up and corrected. I do not wi&s;h to in&s;inuate here, that any attention will be wanting to my arguments, drawn from religion and the fear of God (for his name has been called in to give force to the vows of the nation to their real cre|ditors) or to arguments drawn from morality, national ju&s;|tice and honor, from gratitude and compa&s;&s;ion, &amp;c. the&s;e are arguments to be an&s;wered to God, to the nation, and to con&s;cience.&mdash;But to wave all the&s;e for this time, I beg to conclude with the following que&s;tions, directed to every body:</P>
<P>Fir&s;t que&s;tion. Whether paying the clear profits of the &s;peculators, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> 26,250,000 dollars, will not load and ex|hau&s;t the revenue &s;o much, as to put it out of our power to pay our real debts of the fir&s;t honor, ju&s;tice, covenants, and truth of the nation?</P>
<P><PB N="375" REF="023972_0382_0FC2A97C5D844E10">
Second que&s;tion. Whether this payment will not be matter of general di&s;approbation and di&s;gu&s;t, e&s;pecially when kept alive and fre&s;h in memory, by the annual de|mand of above 1,000,000 dollars to pay the intere&s;t of it?</P>
<P>Third que&s;tion. Whether denying payment to &s;uch of our citizens, who, by their virtue and efforts, &s;aved our country, will not be matter of great di&s;&s;atisfaction to our people, and di&s;courage their future zeal and readine&s;s to &s;erve their country, when their &s;ervices may be nece&s;&s;ary?</P>
<P>It is the <HI>right</HI> as well as <HI>duty</HI> of every citizen, to u&s;e his be&s;t endeavours to avert his country's <HI>dangers</HI> and <HI>impend|ing di&s;tre&s;&s;es,</HI> whenever they appear threatening. Our country has a <HI>right</HI> to the <HI>wi&s;dom</HI> as well as to the <HI>wealth</HI> of all its inhabitants, when the public exigence makes <HI>either or both nece&s;&s;ary,</HI> and the <HI>right of the nation</HI> implies the <HI>duty of its citizens.</HI></P>
<P>In di&s;charge of this <HI>duty,</HI> I here offer my <HI>mite of wi&s;dom,</HI> &s;uch as it is, to my country. If any <HI>one &s;entence</HI> of the&s;e Di&s;&s;ertations does not carry conviction, let it be rejected; but if my <HI>principles</HI> and <HI>arguments reach the heart,</HI> and com|pel the mind of the reader to yield to their <HI>rectitude</HI> and <HI>force,</HI> they will produce the effects I wi&s;h.</P>
<P>But whether I am gratified or di&s;appointed, whether my country be &s;aved or not, I have that <HI>con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of upright intentions</HI> and <HI>faithful endeavours</HI> for the &s;alvation of the Union, which in&s;pires me with the mo&s;t <HI>&s;atisfactory expec|tation,</HI> that I &s;hall be glorious in the eyes of the LORD and of <HI>po&s;terity.</HI></P>

<HEAD>AN ESSAY ON THE SEAT OF THE Federal Government, AND THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF CONGRESS OVER A Ten Miles Di&s;trict; WITH OBSERVATIONS On the Economy and delicate Morals nece&s;&s;ary to be ob|&s;erved in infant States.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">[Fir&s;t publi&s;hed in Philadelphia, Sep. 21, 1789.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The &s;eat of Congre&s;s was at <HI>New-York</HI> at that time.</NOTE>]</HEAD>
<P>AS the <HI>fixing the Seat of the Federal Government</HI> is a &s;ubject, which has of late engro&s;&s;ed the attention of many people both in and out of Congre&s;s, perhaps a few ob&s;ervations on the nature and con&s;equences of that mea&s;ure may be u&s;eful, and, of cour&s;e, acceptable at this time. I offer my be&s;t thoughts with freedom, without meaning to offend.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Tho' the <HI>United States</HI> of <HI>America</HI> contain about 640,000,000 acres of land, which have every advantage of &s;oil and &s;ituation that any country can boa&s;t, and tho' their territory is equal to <HI>Great-Britain, Germany, France,</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> taken together, yet their population and civil e&s;tabli&s;hments are both young, and, as yet, in the tender &s;tate and &s;mall beginnings; and, of cour&s;e, the greate&s;t attention is nece&s;&s;ary to that <HI>poli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> and <HI>economy,</HI> which mu&s;t &s;trengthen, increa&s;e, and connect the whole. I therefore hope, that the humble attempts of the author to point out and patronize &s;ome leading principles of both the&s;e great objects, which are really of mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential con&s;ideration, will meet the candor and favorable attention of Congre&s;s and the Public.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="377" REF="023972_0384_0FC2A99841E78C80">
It appears to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, that deciding, or even pre&s;&s;ing, the que&s;tion of the <HI>permanent re&s;idence</HI> of Congre&s;s is very <HI>im|proper at this time,</HI> becau&s;e,</P>
<P>I. Congre&s;s have it in their power, without moving this que&s;tion, <HI>to obtain every accommodation for them&s;elves which can be nece&s;&s;ary</HI> for years to come, and in a &s;ituation as nearly in the centre of the pre&s;ent population of the States, and as convenient for the whole Union, as any that can be obtained by any fixture of place that can be made, and all this without <HI>any expen&s;e</HI> of the States.</P>
<P>It is certain, that <HI>Philadelphia</HI> can and readily would fur|ni&s;h any and all public buildings, which Congre&s;s can need for their two Hou&s;es; and it is likewi&s;e certain, that all the public officers have &s;uch <HI>liberal appointments,</HI> that they can very well afford to pay any &s;mall rent which would be ne|ce&s;&s;ary for their offices.</P>
<P>It is farther certain, that <HI>Philadelphia</HI> is neare<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> to the <HI>centre</HI> and <HI>general convenience</HI> of the States, in their pre&s;ent &s;tate of population, than any &s;pot either on the <HI>Potowmac</HI> or <HI>Su&s;quehannah,</HI> or any <HI>other place propo&s;ed</HI> for the perma|nent re&s;idence of Congre&s;s, and will probably continue &s;o for many years.</P>
<P>II. Fixing the &s;eat of government will be altogether u&s;e|le&s;s, <HI>till a &s;um of money can be advanced, &s;ufficient to purcha&s;e the &s;oil, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rect the nece&s;&s;ary buildings; which will require</HI> (according to the e&s;timate of the Lower Hou&s;e of Congre&s;s) 100,000 <HI>dollars.</HI> But it is certain, that, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of our finances, and the numerous and pre&s;&s;ing de|mands on the trea&s;ury, we are in no condition to <HI>advance any &s;uch &s;um;</HI> we have large debts called for in the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing manner, by creditors both foreign and dome&s;tic,
<PB N="378" REF="023972_0385_0FC2A9998FAC38E8">
who&s;e demands we are bound to &s;atisfy with the fir&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|nies we can rai&s;e, either from our own re&s;ources or our credit; the&s;e demands, I &s;ay, we are bound to &s;atisfy, on every principle of <HI>ju&s;tice, public faith, national honor, and common hone&s;ty,</HI> nay, by every inducement of <HI>gratitude, and even compa&s;&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>It follows then, that <HI>to delay the&s;e payments,</HI> in order to &s;quander away 100,000 dollars on buildings of no immedi|ate u&s;e or nece&s;&s;ity, is an act of very <HI>high inju&s;tice,</HI> and even <HI>wickedne&s;s;</HI> it is pro&s;tituting the <HI>ju&s;tice, honor,</HI> and even <HI>morality</HI> of the nation, to very little more than <HI>vain &s;how</HI> and <HI>pageantry.</HI></P>
<P>It may, indeed, be doubtful what &s;ort of ju&s;tice or gra|titude is due to the <HI>purcha&s;ers of alienated certificates;</HI> but there can certainly be no doubt of the <HI>ju&s;tice and gratitude too,</HI> which is due to the <HI>original holders</HI> of certificates, who actually rendered their <HI>&s;ervices, &s;upplies,</HI> and <HI>ca&s;h</HI> to the States, in the time of their <HI>highe&s;t dangers</HI> and <HI>di&s;tre&s;&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e men did in fact pay the purcha&s;e of our inde|pendence; and can it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that <HI>Americans</HI> can en|joy all the rich ble&s;&s;ings of their independence, and, at the &s;ame time, refu&s;e payment to the <HI>fir&s;t purcha&s;ers</HI> of it, who come like beggars to &s;olicit payment, to relieve them from the penury and di&s;tre&s;s which they &s;uffer for want of it?&mdash;Mu&s;t all this &s;candal, meanne&s;s, and wrong be incurred, in order to lavi&s;h immen&s;e &s;ums on a parcel of <HI>large edi|fices,</HI> to be reared up in the woods, and which are no more nece&s;&s;ary to the pre&s;ent honor, &s;afety, or even convenience of the States, than a fifth wheel to a coach? Common &s;en&s;e forbids it.</P>
<P>It is manife&s;tly as wicked, &s;hameful, inhuman, and ridiculous for a State to do this, as for an individual to purcha&s;e <HI>a large e&s;tate,</HI> enjoy the <HI>rich produce</HI> of it, and re|fu&s;e to pay the <HI>original purcha&s;e of it,</HI> becau&s;e the creditor happens to be a poor creature, who cannot <HI>compel</HI> him to payment. Can &s;uch a man, with any rea&s;on, expect either the <HI>ble&s;&s;ings of Heaven, e&s;teem of mankind,</HI> or any <HI>kind of pro&s;perity</HI> in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch iniquitous affluence and in|glorious grandeur? whil&s;t the original purcha&s;e-money is
<PB N="379" REF="023972_0386_0FC2A99B02DADD90">
<HI>wrongfully withheld</HI> from the creditor; and the money due to him is laid out in &s;umptuous buildings and gaudy pa|rade.</P>
<P>I &s;hould think, that gentlemen who can propo&s;e &s;uch a plan, have forgot the great principles of <HI>ju&s;tice, public faith,</HI> and <HI>economy,</HI> on which alone the <HI>honor, e&s;tabli&s;hment,</HI> and <HI>&s;afety</HI> of a nation can be founded, and, in&s;tead of the&s;e, have adopted the &s;entiments of young beaus and girls, who think the highe&s;t di&s;tinction con&s;i&s;ts in the fine|ry of their dre&s;s, and &s;et that mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> down as undoubtedly the mo&s;t re&s;pectable, who&s;e clothes and jewels are the riche&s;t and mo&s;t brilliant.</P>
<P>When there is an e&s;tate much involved, it commonly happens that &s;ome debts, on account of <HI>greater original merit, better earnings,</HI> or other <HI>cau&s;es,</HI> are deemed to be of a <HI>higher nature</HI> than others, and are therefore entitled to a <HI>precedency</HI> or <HI>priority</HI> of payment; the <HI>original holders</HI> of the public &s;ecurities have undoubtedly this claim, and are there|fore entitled to precedency of payment, and the States are undoubtedly furni&s;hed with &s;ufficient re&s;ources to pay them, or, at lea&s;t, their annual or half-yearly intere&s;t; and the&s;e re&s;ources ought not to be diverted from &s;o nece&s;&s;ary and ho|norable an object, to the vain purpo&s;es of ridiculous parade or extravagant appointments, or other <HI>Utopian</HI> expen&s;es.</P>
<P>But it may be objected to this by hone&s;t men, who will &s;ay, 'we approve the ju&s;tice and rea&s;on of this propo&s;i|tion; it <HI>coincides</HI> with the <HI>very &s;entiments of the heart,</HI> and meets both the <HI>hone&s;t</HI> and <HI>grateful feelings</HI> of our &s;ouls; but, alas! it is <HI>impracticable,</HI> becau&s;e the original holders of the public &s;ecurities cannot be <HI>a&s;certained</HI> and <HI>di&s;crimi|nated</HI> from others who are not &s;uch; many who are really original holders, will not be able to prove that they are &s;uch.' In an&s;wer to this, I readily admit that any man who pre&s;ents him&s;elf as an original holder, and claims the benefit of precedence of payment, mu&s;t prove him&s;elf to be &s;uch, <HI>i. e.</HI> the proof will lie on him, and which almo&s;t the whole of them will be able to produce with the utmo&s;t certainty, becau&s;e their names are <HI>recorded</HI> in the <HI>public of|fices,</HI> in which their accounts were <HI>&s;ettled,</HI> and out of which
<PB N="380" REF="023972_0387_0FC2A9AD666D3820">
their <HI>certificates i&s;&s;ued,</HI> and tho' &s;ome few will not be able to make this proof, and &s;o mu&s;t lo&s;e the benefit for want of proof, yet this affords no rea&s;on why tho&s;e who <HI>can make proof,</HI> &s;hould lo&s;e the benefit of it; we might as well deny that <HI>authenticated deeds</HI> &s;hould be admitted as good evi|dence of titles of lands to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, becau&s;e many peo|ple have purcha&s;ed e&s;tates, but have either neglected <HI>to pro|cure</HI> the proper deeds, or, by &s;ome misfortune, <HI>have lo&s;t</HI> them, and, of cour&s;e, mu&s;t lo&s;e their e&s;tates, for want of the proper evidence of that <HI>right</HI> which is <HI>really</HI> in them.</P>
<P>III. In the late public debates of Congre&s;s on the &s;ub|ject of fixing the permanent &s;eat of government, gentle|men differed &s;o extremely <HI>in their e&s;timates of the di&s;tance of &s;tations, convenience of pa&s;&s;age both by land and water, &s;alu|brity or unhealthine&s;s of places, &s;tate of population, and many other circum&s;tances</HI> nece&s;&s;ary to be taken into account, that it appears very plain, that the internal geography and ma|ny other local qualities of the United States are not &s;uffi|ciently defined and under&s;tood, to enable us to fix even the <HI>centrality</HI> of the States, and a&s;certain many other things ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to be known and con&s;idered, in deter|mining the permanent &s;eat of government. Therefore, it is prudent to put off that determination, till the <HI>data</HI> on which it manife&s;tly ought to depend, can be more fully known and a&s;certained.</P>
<P>IV. It is expected that <HI>four or five States will &s;oon be ad|ded to the pre&s;ent Union;</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>North-Carolina</HI> and <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI> had not, at the time this E&s;&s;ay was publi&s;hed, acceded to the Union under the New Con&s;titution: the acce&s;&s;ion of &s;ome <HI>new</HI> States was expected, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>Vermont, Kentucky, &amp;c.</HI></NOTE> the acce&s;&s;ion of two of them we hope to be very near, and it is unrea&s;onable to pu&s;h the deci&s;ion of a que&s;tion (which is thought by many to be of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence to the whole Union) <HI>by only a part of the whole,</HI> when, by a little delay, in no manner preju|dicial to us, a deci&s;ion may be obtained, in which <HI>every part</HI> may have its due weight and influence.</P>
<P>But there is another rea&s;on again&s;t an immediate deci|&s;ion of the que&s;tion (and perhaps of more con&s;equence
<PB N="381" REF="023972_0388_0FC2A9B3146F2F98">
than this) which is drawn from the pre&s;ent &s;tate of Con|gre&s;s, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>
<P>V. In the late di&s;cu&s;&s;ions of this &s;ubject in Congre&s;s, different gentlemen adopted <HI>different &s;pots or places for the &s;eat of government,</HI> and became divided into two parties nearly equal; each contending for his favorite &s;pot with all force of argument and energy of zeal; and both parties adhered to their &s;everal favorite po&s;itions with &s;uch pointed and inflexible ob&s;tinacy, and worked them&s;elves up to &s;uch an acrimony of debate, that it became impo&s;&s;ible to force the deci&s;ion, without giving a &s;ort of triumph to one par|ty, and &s;ubjecting the other to very &s;en&s;ible mortification; and as the majority mu&s;t be very &s;mall, if the que&s;tion is pu&s;hed on to a deci&s;ion (for the parties are nearly equal) it is much to be feared that the affair will produce much di&s;&s;atisfaction, and perhaps de&s;troy mutual confidence and good-humor, which may in future <HI>weaken our coun&s;els,</HI> and <HI>le&s;&s;en our unanimity</HI> in matters that have <HI>no connection with the &s;eat of government;</HI> for it is well known, that irritated parties rarely adopt much accommodating temper or bene|volent conde&s;cen&s;ion one towards another.</P>
<P><HI>England</HI> and <HI>France, Holland</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> give us, in their hi&s;tories, dreadful le&s;&s;ons of the tragical effects of &s;tate-parties, and I pray God, we may have prudence enough to put an early &s;top to them, if we find them in &s;mall be|ginnings growing among&s;t us.</P>
<P>For the&s;e rea&s;ons I wi&s;h the &s;aid deci&s;ion may be po&s;t|poned; I would wi&s;h this, if it was only to give gentlemen <HI>time</HI> to cool, and, <HI>when cool,</HI> to <HI>revi&s;e</HI> their <HI>opinions</HI> and <HI>ar|guments.</HI>&mdash;Time &s;oftens the acrimony of the mind, takes off the edge of the pa&s;&s;ions, makes room for charity and benevolence, and may perhaps produce &s;uch a &s;pirit of ac|commodation, as, together with new information and new lights that may be thrown on the &s;ubject, may produce in a future time a deci&s;ion which will &s;trengthen our union, without any danger of weakening or de&s;troying it.</P>
<P>Perhaps it may appear in future time, that neither of the &s;pots contended for are on the whole eligible, and, of cour&s;e, both parties may yield their favorite po&s;itions, with|out
<PB N="382" REF="023972_0389_0FC2A9B48FC85438">
giving any cau&s;e of triumph to their opponents.&mdash;But there are &s;till other rea&s;ons for a po&s;tponement of this de|ci&s;ion not yet mentioned, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>
<P>VI. <HI>Centrality will undoubtedly be (c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">teris paribus) the principle on which the &s;eat of government ought to be placed,</HI> becau&s;e every part of the Union has equal right to accom|modation; but this mu&s;t be a <HI>centrality of population,</HI> not of <HI>territory;</HI> it cannot matter much whether the &s;eat of government is at little or great di&s;tance from tho&s;e parts of the territory, which con&s;i&s;t of uninhabited woods and lakes.</P>
<P>But this centre is, in its nature, a <HI>moving point,</HI> and mu&s;t and will continue &s;o, till the population of every part of the territory is complete, and becomes invariable, which, in the common cour&s;e of human events, can never hap|pen. And no kind of e&s;tabli&s;hment which we can give to the &s;eat of government, will keep it <HI>fixed</HI> and <HI>unmoved,</HI> when future rea&s;ons and future coun&s;els &s;hall operate a|gain&s;t it.</P>
<P>Therefore, it is altogether vain and highly imprudent to endeavour to fix our &s;eat of government by laying out any more money than is of immediate u&s;e and ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;i|ty, in furni&s;hing the accommodations of it, and e&s;pecially at a time when <HI>out finances</HI> are extremely <HI>low and deranged,</HI> our people greatly <HI>burdened,</HI> and the <HI>honor</HI> and <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> of the States every where &s;uffering in a &s;candalous manner, by our <HI>breaches of faith</HI> and <HI>failure of public credit.</HI></P>
<P>But tho' centrality is the principle <HI>(caeteris paribus)</HI> on which the &s;eat of government ought to be placed, yet <HI>(cae|teris non paribus)</HI> it may become otherwi&s;e; many other things may occur, to make a removal from centrality ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>VII. The &s;eat of government ought to be in a place where the <HI>court</HI> and <HI>officers</HI> of government, and all the <HI>va&s;t numbers of people,</HI> both citizens and foreigners, who have occa&s;ion to re&s;ort there, may <HI>be accommodated in the be&s;t and mo&s;t convenient manner;</HI> but it is certain, that neither the one nor the other have any chance for &s;uch accommoda|tions on the de&s;ert banks of the <HI>Potowmac</HI> or <HI>Su&s;quehannah</HI>
<PB N="383" REF="023972_0390_0FC2A9C1D5B9E7A8">
for many, many years to come; therefore, I think it be&s;t to defer moving to either of the places for the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>VIII. The &s;eat of government ought to be in a place of <HI>the greate&s;t attainable intelligence,</HI> that the rulers may take benefit of the mo&s;t exten&s;ive <HI>corre&s;pondences</HI> of men of all profe&s;&s;ions, of foreigners re&s;orting from every part of the earth, of the mo&s;t complete <HI>libraries, maps,</HI> &amp;<HI>c.</HI> &amp;<HI>c.</HI></P>
<P>Congre&s;s may have concerns with all the world. Not a citizen in the States can have a connexion in any part of the earth, but, on &s;ome occa&s;ion or other, Congre&s;s may <HI>have the matter before them.</HI> They mu&s;t pre&s;ide over all improvements of the country, in which the experience and information of foreigners may be of e&s;&s;ential u&s;e. We may be intere&s;ted in the cu&s;toms of foreign nations, which nobody can explain &s;o well as their own people re&s;iding among us, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>It is not &s;uppo&s;able that the Members of Congre&s;s will come <HI>from home,</HI> furni&s;hed with competent knowledge of all the &s;ubjects they will have occa&s;ion to con&s;ider and de|cide; and if they have <HI>not this knowledge,</HI> they mu&s;t obtain it <HI>by information,</HI> as other folks do, and, of cour&s;e, mu&s;t be furni&s;hed with <HI>the means of information;</HI> but I think we might as well immure them in the <HI>bottom of a well,</HI> or &s;hut them up in a <HI>cave,</HI> where they would be effectually cut off from all intelligence of the world, as place them within the de&s;ert, dreary <HI>fogs,</HI> and di&s;heartening <HI>agues</HI> of either the <HI>Potowmac</HI> or <HI>Su&s;quehannah,</HI> where there is nothing <HI>grand</HI> and <HI>maje&s;tic</HI> to be &s;een, but the <HI>ice</HI> and <HI>floods,</HI> and nothing <HI>lively</HI> to be heard or felt, but <HI>mu&s;k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">toes.</HI> I am of opinion, the defects of nature mu&s;t be corrected by art, before ei|ther of the&s;e places can become the be&s;t centre of intelli|gence in <HI>America;</HI> and therefore, I think Congre&s;s need not be in much hurry to move to either of them.</P>
<P>IX. It is nece&s;&s;ary the &s;eat of government &s;hould be placed where <HI>the manufactures, agriculture, trade, and wealth of the country can receive the be&s;t protection and encouragement,</HI> and be mo&s;t ea&s;ily and properly <HI>directed and regulated by the government.</HI> The great fir&s;t principles of our wealth are our great &s;taples of manufactures and agriculture; the&s;e
<PB N="384" REF="023972_0391_0FC2A9C2CC474B98">
both receive their invigorating principle from our trade, for nobody would labor much to rai&s;e the produce of the earth, or make fabrics, if there was no trade to make a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> for them, or no market where they could be &s;old.</P>
<P>This, of cour&s;e, brings the whole into action on the <HI>various &s;eats of navigation,</HI> and, of cour&s;e, it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that the &s;eat of government &s;hould be near &s;uch &s;eat of navigation, that government may have the be&s;t op|portunities to cheri&s;h and protect the&s;e mo&s;t important in|tere&s;ts, which not only compri&s;e the grand <HI>wealth</HI> and <HI>re|&s;ources</HI> of the &s;ubject, but out of which mu&s;t be derived the great and mo&s;t <HI>capital &s;upplies</HI> of the government.</P>
<P>Farther, if it is nece&s;&s;ary that the &s;eat of government &s;hould be near <HI>any</HI> of the&s;e &s;eats of navigation and trade, it is evid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">y mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary, that it &s;hould be placed near to <HI>the greate&s;t &s;eat and centre</HI> of them.</P>
<P>But neither the banks of <HI>Potowmac</HI> nor <HI>Su&s;quehannah</HI> are near any &s;uch centre, nor have either of them any chance of ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;uch advantage; therefore, I think it be&s;t to put off at lea&s;t for the pre&s;ent an emigration to either of them.</P>
<P>X. It is nece&s;&s;ary that the &s;eat of government &s;hould be placed in that po&s;ition, which is mo&s;t convenient for the <HI>defence and protection of the Union.</HI> Our State is yet young; we are yet ignorant how far, and in what light, we may be con&s;idered in the political &s;y&s;tems of the <HI>European</HI> or <HI>Afri|can nations,</HI> or what de&s;igns they are or may be meditating concerning us; I &s;uppo&s;e, our derangements and pre&s;&s;ures &s;ince the peace have &s;et us in a &s;omewhat di&s;advantageous light among them; but <HI>nature</HI> will &s;oon give us <HI>con&s;equence,</HI> as, in the ordinary cour&s;e of events, another century will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> us as <HI>numerous,</HI> and perhaps as <HI>powerful</HI> and <HI>rich,</HI> as the <HI>greate&s;t</HI> of them, and, of cour&s;e, we &s;hall be as <HI>re&s;pect|able,</HI> if we have <HI>wi&s;dom</HI> enough to improve our advan|tages.</P>
<P>The <HI>two colonies</HI> of the <HI>European</HI> powers, to which we are contiguous, are &s;o thinly inhabited and weak, that I conceive we are in little danger from them; the <HI>Indians</HI> we can ea&s;ily manage; our connexions with all the other
<PB N="385" REF="023972_0392_0FC2A9C75D4EBF20">
nations of the world mu&s;t depend <HI>on navigation,</HI> for we can neither pa&s;s to them, nor they to us, otherwi&s;e than acro&s;s the &s;ea.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e nobody does now, or perhaps ever will, wi&s;h for any other than <HI>commercial connections</HI> with any of them; but even our commerce may require <HI>protection,</HI> and as the caprices of mankind are &s;ometimes very vicious, and may lead to actions very provoking, it is not impo&s;&s;ible we may be in&s;ulted <HI>on our own coa&s;ts,</HI> or even in our harbours, if we are wholly <HI>void of force</HI> to protect them.</P>
<P>All this brings into view the very <HI>great importance of our navigation,</HI> which is the great means of our commerce, and, of cour&s;e, of our wealth, which will doubtle&s;s re|quire very exten&s;ive and numerous &s;hipping; and the&s;e will make a <HI>naval force,</HI> greater or le&s;s, at lea&s;t in &s;ome degree, nece&s;&s;ary; and as this is an object on which not only the <HI>wealth,</HI> but even the <HI>character</HI> and <HI>&s;afety,</HI> of the States will <HI>capitally depend,</HI> it in&s;tantly ri&s;es into view as an intere&s;t, an accommodation, of &s;uch va&s;t magnitude, as to require a &s;ort of precedence of con&s;ideration, of mo&s;t ca|pital and decided attention; and, of cour&s;e, will at lea&s;t require the <HI>&s;eat of government</HI> to be &s;o near to the <HI>&s;eat of it,</HI> as may be nece&s;&s;ary to give it all the in&s;pection, &s;up|port, and protection, that a matter of &s;uch capital con&s;e|quence mu&s;t require from government.</P>
<P>The banks of <HI>Potowmac</HI> and <HI>Su&s;quehannah</HI> are too re|mote from any practicable <HI>&s;eat of a navy,</HI> to admit any probability that it will ever be properly attended to by a court at &s;uch di&s;tance. We have no in&s;tance of any na|tion, which pays a proper attention to their navigation, who&s;e <HI>&s;eat of government</HI> is at a <HI>great di&s;tance</HI> from their <HI>principal harbours.</HI></P>
<P><HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> have good harbours, and every induce|ment and advantage for building and furni&s;hing a complete navy, but their capitals are far removed from the &s;ight of &s;hips, and, of cour&s;e, they are neglected.</P>
<P>On the contrary, the courts of <HI>England, Holland, Ve|nice,</HI> and <HI>Genoa,</HI> have their harbours near them, and their &s;hipping is rarely neglected or out of order.</P>
<P><PB N="386" REF="023972_0393_0FC2A9C9243DA238">
In as much, then, as capital con&s;iderations ought ever to control capital deci&s;ions, I have no doubt but a &s;eat of the federal government will be looked for and found, not on the banks of <HI>Potowmac</HI> or <HI>Su&s;quehannah,</HI> but near to &s;ome <HI>navigable water,</HI> proper for the <HI>capital &s;tation of a na|vy;</HI> and to recede from this principle will indicate not <HI>er|ror of judgment,</HI> not <HI>corruption of heart alone,</HI> but <HI>ab&s;olute, total madne&s;s;</HI> and for the ju&s;tice of this remark, I appeal to the &s;entiments of all the citizens of <HI>America,</HI> and of all their friends in the world.</P>
<P>Time has fully ju&s;tified <HI>Peter</HI> the Great, Czar of <HI>Mu&s;|covy;</HI> who, on the force of this very principle, removed the &s;eat of his Empire from its ancient po&s;ition, near 500 miles farther from the centre of his dominions, and into a climate and &s;oil much le&s;s de&s;irable, merely to gain a &s;itu|ation <HI>contiguous to a harbour for his &s;hips;</HI> in con&s;equence of which his Empire is amazingly enriched by trade, and become very re&s;pectable for its <HI>naval force.</HI></P>
<P>But I &s;uppo&s;e it will be &s;trongly objected to any delay of fixing the &s;eat of government, that, till that is done, Con|gre&s;s cannot come into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their <HI>exclu&s;ive juri&s;dic|tion over ten miles &s;quare of territory,</HI> which is to &s;urround their &s;eat when fixed, and not before; and, of cour&s;e, till then they cannot enjoy the advantages of it.</P>
<P>This is a mea&s;ure that has been adopted and approved by &s;o many votes of Convention, Congre&s;s, and particular States, that I &s;uppo&s;e my&s;elf very &s;tupid, whil&s;t I cannot &s;ee any kind of fitne&s;s or propriety in the mea&s;ure, or any advantages that will naturally re&s;ult from it. But as <HI>&s;tu|pidity is no crime,</HI> and nobody can be rightfully <HI>blamed for not under&s;tanding</HI> what is <HI>totally out of the reach of his men|tal powers,</HI> or for <HI>not &s;eeing</HI> what does not appear <HI>vi&s;ible</HI> to him, I will venture to give my thoughts on this &s;ubject, in full expectation, not of <HI>blame</HI> and <HI>cen&s;ure,</HI> but of being deemed mo&s;t uncommonly <HI>&s;tupid</HI> and <HI>dull,</HI> in not being able to comprehend what is &s;o <HI>very clear</HI> and <HI>plain</HI> to other folks.</P>
<P>I. In the fir&s;t place, I can ea&s;ily conceive that Congre&s;s ought to have and enjoy all <HI>powers, authorities,</HI> and <HI>juri&s;|dictions,</HI>
<PB N="387" REF="023972_0394_0FC2A9D662E46750">
<HI>that are or can be nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve their own dig|nity, re&s;pectability,</HI> and <HI>&s;tate;</HI> &s;ufficient fully to &s;ecure them, to all intents and purpo&s;es, again&s;t all contempts, violences, intru&s;ions, or embarra&s;&s;ments, and to regulate and adju&s;t their own order, economy, and even ceremony, in the mo&s;t proper and decent manner, which they can devi&s;e; and that they &s;hall be fully empowered to <HI>try and puni&s;h</HI> all violations and tre&s;pa&s;&s;es in any of the&s;e re&s;pects, either by acts of their corporate or aggregate body, or by &s;uch judges or officers as they &s;hall appoint; and that all the&s;e powers &s;hall be &s;uperior to, and uncontrollable by, any other power or authority whatever.</P>
<P>All <HI>the&s;e powers of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation</HI> ought undoubtedly to exi&s;t in the fulle&s;t manner in that augu&s;t body, and their prudence in the exerci&s;e of them may &s;afely, and mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily, be relied on by the citizens of the States, with|out in&s;tituting any &s;uperior authority to control them.&mdash;But, in the &s;econd place, it appears to me,</P>
<P>II. That the&s;e powers, authorities, and juri&s;dictions mu&s;t not be <HI>fa&s;tened or limited to any particular place;</HI> but mu&s;t be <HI>inherent</HI> in that augu&s;t body, and mu&s;t <HI>go and come</HI> with them when and where&s;oever <HI>they move.</HI></P>
<P>If, by the inva&s;ions of an enemy, a conflagration of their edifices, the infections of a plague, or any other cau&s;e, they &s;hould find it convenient to remove their court or the &s;eat of their re&s;idence to &s;ome di&s;tant place, they mu&s;t <HI>carry all the&s;e juri&s;dictions</HI> and <HI>powers with them;</HI> it will not do well to leave them behind; their u&s;e will be as great and nece&s;&s;ary in the place to which they move, as it was in the place they have left, and it would be hard upon that augu&s;t body, to add to their calamities of removal, the additional mortification of being le&s;&s;ened and deflower|ed by it.</P>
<P>III. I have no idea that the citizens of any one di&s;trict &s;hould be any more <HI>&s;ubject to the authority and control</HI> of Congre&s;s, or &s;hould be <HI>entitled to their benefits or notice</HI> in any way whatever, <HI>more than all the re&s;t.</HI> Every citizen has <HI>equal right</HI> to all the benefits of, and owes <HI>equal duty</HI> to, that &s;upreme body. Any <HI>di&s;tinctions</HI> of this &s;ort lay a

foundation for partialities, expectations, or at lea&s;t jealou|&s;ies, which are very pernicious in &s;ociety; and altho' the citizens of the ten miles di&s;trict may be few at fir&s;t, yet we &s;hall probably find (whatever objections Congre&s;s have to a re&s;idence in cities) that buildings and inhabitants will multiply round their court very &s;oon into a large city; in which numerous occa&s;ions will probably ari&s;e to operate on the above-mentioned &s;ources of di&s;content and cha|grin.</P>
<P>IV. Congre&s;s will have to make a <HI>whole code of laws</HI> for the <HI>ten miles di&s;trict,</HI> to <HI>appoint</HI> every judiciary and execu|tive <HI>officer,</HI> and to &s;uperintend the <HI>admini&s;tration</HI> of the whole; and if they are as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">low about that, as they are in organizing the federal government (and the ca&s;e is quite as novel, and the ground equally untrodden) this work may probably take up their time many months; and as the States pay them about 1000 dollars a day, during their &s;e&s;&s;ion, the admini&s;tration of the di&s;trict will &s;oon co&s;t the States 100,000 <HI>dollars;</HI> which is much more than either we <HI>can &s;pare,</HI> or the di&s;trict <HI>can be worth</HI> to us.</P>
<P>V. The whole <HI>police of the di&s;trict</HI> will be a <HI>&s;oleci&s;m</HI> in the federal government; their laws will be made and im|po&s;ed by people that are not <HI>of their election,</HI> but by &s;tran|gers, not by even their own fellow-citizens. It is altoge|ther at the option of Congre&s;s, whether they may <HI>appoint</HI> one officer of their police, either judiciary or executive; they have no voice in <HI>taxation</HI> or giving their own money; they do <HI>not belong</HI> to the Thirteen States, for they are <HI>no part</HI> of either of them, and, of cour&s;e, <HI>not parties</HI> to the confederation, nor are they a State of them&s;elves; the <HI>pro|ce&s;s</HI> of none of the confederated States <HI>can run</HI> there, &s;o that, for any thing they can do, their di&s;trict will be a <HI>re|fuge</HI> for debtors, thieves, and even murderers.</P>
<P>They mu&s;t &s;ubmit, right or wrong, to the deci&s;ions of their rulers, for they have <HI>no appeal,</HI> no refuge from <HI>injury or tyranny;</HI> and this is no very comfortable circum&s;tance, if we con&s;ider a little how common it is for courts to <HI>op|pre&s;s</HI> the cities in which they re&s;ide. And if, under the&s;e circum&s;tances, the di&s;trict &s;hould think them&s;elves op|pre&s;&s;ed,

and &s;hould happen to <HI>rebel or rai&s;e an in&s;urrection,</HI> the <HI>force of the Union</HI> mu&s;t be called in to quell them; and this will occa&s;ion another <HI>expen&s;e</HI> to the States, both of <HI>blood and trea&s;ure,</HI> which I &s;trongly object to.</P>
<P>VI. Be&s;ides all this, I know not what <HI>they will do,</HI> or what will <HI>become of them,</HI> if Congre&s;s &s;hould happen to <HI>re|move from them</HI> finally, and <HI>not return;</HI> here mu&s;t be an|other <HI>new road cut</HI> to their final de&s;tination, I know not how nor where.</P>
<P>After all this trouble and expen&s;e, I cannot &s;ee <HI>one &s;ingle benefit</HI> or <HI>advantage</HI> which can accrue to the <HI>Congre&s;s,</HI> or the <HI>States,</HI> or the <HI>di&s;trict,</HI> from the whole of it; the powers and juri&s;dictions above de&s;cribed appear to me to contain every thing, every authority which Congre&s;s can po&s;&s;ibly need. I take it they are all <HI>compri&s;ed</HI> in the <HI>con&s;titution,</HI> tho' not <HI>particularly</HI> enumerated there; but if it &s;hould be judged that the&s;e powers are not given <HI>explicitly enough</HI> in the con&s;titution, they can ea&s;ily be added by way of <HI>amend|ment,</HI> and I dare believe every State will readily <HI>ratify</HI> them.</P>
<P>But I am tired of gazing at this ten miles di&s;trict, this <HI>unnatural object,</HI> this <HI>&s;port of police;</HI> for I can really make <HI>nothing</HI> of it; and &s;o I quit it, being willing to refer it over to Congre&s;s to make <HI>&s;omething</HI> of it, if they can.</P>
<P>I now return from this long and weari&s;ome di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this great objection again&s;t any delay in fixing the &s;eat of government, and return to my principal &s;ubject, which I mean briefly to revi&s;e, and reduce the matter to very few words, as follows:</P>
<P>We have every nece&s;&s;ary building for the u&s;e of Con|gre&s;s ready made, and have no need of new ones; and if we did need them, we have no money to &s;pare to build them, &s;o long as our debts (of mo&s;t poignant pre&s;&s;ure and di&s;tre&s;s) are unpaid;&mdash;the geography and other circum|&s;tances of the States are not &s;ufficiantly known, to enable us to a&s;certain the mo&s;t central place for a &s;eat of govern|ment;&mdash;the pre&s;ent violent heats in Congre&s;s about this &s;ubject render a deci&s;ion of it dangerous at this time;&mdash;we expect an acce&s;&s;ion of new States, who ought to have their

weight in the deci&s;ion, but they mu&s;t be excluded, if the deci&s;ion is pu&s;hed before their acce&s;&s;ion;&mdash;that any attempt to e&s;tabli&s;h a permanent &s;eat of government of long dura|tion, is impracticable and vain, as the ju&s;t and central point for &s;uch a &s;eat will, in its nature, be always moving, and future rea&s;ons and coun&s;els will alter any e&s;tabli&s;h|ments we can now make;&mdash;that the &s;eat of government ought doubtle&s;s to be &s;ituated in the place of the greate&s;t intelligence,&mdash;in the centre of commerce and navigation,&mdash;and as near as may be to the mo&s;t capital and convenient &s;tation or harbour of the navy,&mdash;and in that place which is mo&s;t convenient for the general protection and defence of all the States.</P>
<P>Upon the whole matter, the <HI>great internal &s;ources of our wealth,</HI> which are derived from the labor of our people, either in the way of <HI>hu&s;bandry</HI> or <HI>manufactures,</HI> all tend to <HI>a centre</HI> in the <HI>line of navigation,</HI> which runs near the &s;ea|coa&s;t, from one end of the States to the other; the <HI>exter|nal</HI> wealth derived from our <HI>trade</HI> with foreign countries, tends to and centres in <HI>the &s;ame line;</HI> here <HI>both meet</HI> and <HI>receive their invigorating principle,</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> their <HI>market.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>market</HI> or <HI>&s;ale</HI> is the principle which gives <HI>life</HI> and <HI>vigor</HI> to <HI>both</HI> the&s;e: this principle is put in action on this <HI>great line of navigation;</HI> here the &s;ales of <HI>both</HI> are made; the one is <HI>purcha&s;ed</HI> and <HI>&s;hipped</HI> for <HI>exportation,</HI> the other is <HI>purcha&s;ed</HI> and <HI>&s;ent off</HI> for <HI>con&s;umption,</HI> into the various parts of the country.</P>
<P>On this <HI>line,</HI> then, is the great <HI>&s;eat</HI> and <HI>centre of negoti|ation,</HI> both of our <HI>home</HI> produce, and our <HI>imported</HI> wealth; here are to be found the <HI>great exchanges</HI> of the nation, and, of cour&s;e, the <HI>greate&s;t plenty of ca&s;h,</HI> and here are found the <HI>great banks,</HI> the riche&s;t <HI>repo&s;itories</HI> of money, and the grand <HI>conduits</HI> of its circulation.</P>
<P>On this &s;ame line runs the greate&s;t cour&s;e of <HI>intelligence</HI> and <HI>advice</HI> from one end of the States to the other; and next to this are the <HI>communications</HI> which are conveyed <HI>by &s;ea,</HI> from the <HI>remote&s;t countries</HI> on one &s;ide, and by the <HI>great roads</HI> leading from the extremities of the <HI>interior coun|try</HI> on the other; but both centre and unite on this grand
<PB N="391" REF="023972_0398_0FC2A9EAD34A6A60">
line of communication: for the truth of this I appeal to every po&s;t-office in the Union, and to every man who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s has any connexion with the general communica|tion of the country.</P>
<P>It is farther obvious, and &s;o intuitively plain that it can|not need a proof, that a court, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s lies <HI>with all men and all places,</HI> ought to be &s;eated in the <HI>greate&s;t centre of that communication which connects them all.</HI></P>
<P>It follows then, by the mo&s;t intuitive evidence, that the <HI>&s;eat</HI> of the federal government ought to be placed on the <HI>great line of navigation,</HI> and as near the geographical <HI>centre</HI> of it, as the great centre of wealth and communication can be found, and as near as may be to the grand <HI>&s;tation of the navigation,</HI> both of <HI>commerce</HI> and <HI>force,</HI> which mu&s;t in&s;ure the wealth, honor, and &s;afety of the whole.</P>
<P>Another obvious and very intere&s;ting rea&s;on why the &s;eat of government ought to be placed in the grand centre of trade and communication, is this, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> very <HI>many people</HI> will have <HI>bu&s;ine&s;s</HI> of importance <HI>with the federal court</HI> or &s;ome of its <HI>public offices,</HI> which may be well enough done <HI>without their per&s;onal attendance,</HI> and they will have many more opportunities of <HI>&s;ending</HI> their bu&s;ine&s;s by &s;ome per&s;on of confidence who is going to the court, than they could find, if the court was held in &s;ome out-of-the-way place, far from &s;uch centre of general re&s;ort.</P>
<P>It is ea&s;ily ob&s;erved, that a per&s;on in <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> has more op|portunities to &s;end to <HI>New-York,</HI> which lies on the <HI>great road</HI> of general communication, than to <HI>Albany,</HI> which lies acro&s;s the country: a per&s;on at <HI>Pitt&s;burg</HI> has more oppor|tunities to &s;end to <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> than to any place of <HI>half the di&s;tance,</HI> which lies either <HI>north</HI> or <HI>&s;outh</HI> of it; any per|&s;on in the country may &s;end to their <HI>capital ea&s;ier</HI> than to a <HI>neighbouring town,</HI> which lies in any direction which cro&s;&s;es the road to their capital at right angles.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, many people will frequently have bu&s;ine&s;s with the court, and private bu&s;ine&s;s of trade, at the &s;ame time; and it is a great advantage to be able to do both with but one expen&s;e of journey and time; to people who live at great di&s;tance, the&s;e advantages will be very con&s;iderable,
<PB N="392" REF="023972_0399_0FC2A38B355EC7E0">
and the in&s;tances very numerous tho' perhaps the mention|ing the matter here may &s;eem trifling.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;tatements of facts, ob&s;ervations, and rea&s;onings appear to me proper, important, and convincing; and for the truth, ju&s;tice, and fitne&s;s of them, I appeal to the heart of every <HI>American,</HI> to that <HI>approving power</HI> which is to be found in every <HI>human brea&s;t,</HI> and which no man can <HI>control,</HI> when the matter propo&s;ed &s;trikes the mind with a <HI>force</HI> of evidence, which, however <HI>di&s;agreeable</HI> the &s;ubject, will <HI>compel the a&s;&s;ent.</HI></P>
<P>I farther make the &s;ame appeal to the <HI>con&s;cience</HI> of every man, who makes <HI>truth the &s;ole object of his pur&s;uit,</HI> and who has <HI>hone&s;ty</HI> and <HI>firmne&s;s</HI> enough to control the <HI>little &s;ordid pa&s;&s;ions,</HI> which <HI>local attachments, &s;ini&s;ter intere&s;ts,</HI> or party zeal may call up and &s;timulate to <HI>corrupt his judgment,</HI> or to <HI>pro&s;titute</HI> it; but perhaps, in the pre&s;ent corrupt &s;tate of human nature, no degree of virtue or natural firmne&s;s will make a man at all times proof again&s;t the&s;e little pa&s;|&s;ions.</P>
<P>It is lamentable, when we &s;ee a man of dignity of con|duct, noble &s;entiments, great comprehen&s;ion of mind, ex|ten&s;ive erudition, and &s;ound judgment, forget the great principles of his &s;ubject, lo&s;e his balance, and fret him&s;elf out of temper, in patronizing any little local intere&s;ts and partial attachments.&mdash;Good Heaven! how he le&s;&s;ens! how he &s;inks! how out of character he appears! like a clergy|man of &s;anctity grown fooli&s;h with drink; a grave judge lo&s;ing his law in a pa&s;&s;ion; or a &s;enator, entru&s;ted with the confidence and coun&s;els of a nation, fribbling and act|ing like a fool to plea&s;e a courtezan.</P>
<P>If the above principles and rea&s;onings are allowed to be ju&s;t and conclu&s;ive, our next bu&s;ine&s;s will be to look for a place for a &s;eat of government, to which they will apply; I will venture to propo&s;e PHILADELPHIA for the place.</P>
<P>I. It is as near the <HI>geographical centre</HI> as any place in any manner capable of accommodating Congre&s;s; its di&s;tance from the &s;outh line of the States is about 700 <HI>miles;</HI> from the north-ea&s;t extremity, <HI>about the &s;ame;</HI> from <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi,</HI> on an ea&s;t and we&s;t line, perhaps <HI>a little more;</HI> the &s;aid <HI>ea&s;t</HI>
<PB N="393" REF="023972_0400_0FC2A395F19F3B58">
and <HI>we&s;t line</HI> will divide the territory of the Union into <HI>two parts,</HI> of <HI>nearly equal acres.</HI></P>
<P>The computation cannot be made with accuracy, be|cau&s;e the northern boundary, as well as the northern part of the we&s;tern boundary, is little known, and, of cour&s;e, the lines, having never been mea&s;ured, cannot by compu|tation be reduced to certainty; but as far as the <HI>be&s;t maps</HI> we have may be depended on, the difference is not very great, tho' the <HI>&s;outhern part</HI> is the large&s;t of the two, but is greatly covered and incumbered by many <HI>huge mountains</HI> of <HI>immen&s;e length,</HI> every where rendered <HI>incapable of culti|vation</HI> by their <HI>height, precipices,</HI> and <HI>rocks,</HI> al&s;o by <HI>va&s;t bar|ren plains of hot, coar&s;e &s;and,</HI> and by <HI>dry knolls</HI> of land full of <HI>&s;hrubs, hard &s;oil,</HI> and <HI>&s;tones;</HI> all which can never be capable of but &s;mall cultivation, if any at all. The <HI>north|ern part is better land,</HI> more capable of <HI>exten&s;ive</HI> and <HI>uni|form cultivation,</HI> has a <HI>better air,</HI> and <HI>climates</HI> much more <HI>healthy.</HI></P>
<P>The pre&s;ent population of the <HI>northern</HI> part is the <HI>mo&s;t numerous,</HI> if we may compute from the <HI>number of Delegates in Congre&s;s,</HI> which are &s;ent from the two parts, allowing &s;even of the <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> Delegates to the northern part, and one of them to the &s;outhern; as the &s;aid line leaves about <HI>one-eighth part of Penn&s;ylvania</HI> on the <HI>&s;outhern</HI> &s;ide; but the inhabitants of the <HI>northern</HI> part are much the <HI>mo&s;t robu&s;t and indu&s;trious,</HI> and, of cour&s;e, the mo&s;t likely to in|crea&s;e the <HI>wealth</HI> and <HI>&s;trength</HI> of the Union.</P>
<P>The inexhau&s;tible <HI>fi&s;heries</HI> in which the <HI>northern</HI> people are concerned, will add greatly to their <HI>population</HI> and <HI>wealth,</HI> for the <HI>wives of fi&s;hermen</HI> are noted for bearing the <HI>mo&s;t numerous</HI> and <HI>&s;tronge&s;t children:</HI> the &s;imple herring-fi&s;hery is &s;aid to be one of the greate&s;t &s;ources of wealth and population in <HI>Holland;</HI> if &s;o, it is probable the im|men&s;e fi&s;heries of our northern people will have a &s;imilar effect, and of much greater extent.</P>
<P>Indeed, the chance of rapid population is generally much greater in the northern part than in the &s;outhern, for their natural increa&s;e is much greater, and their people are not only more enterpri&s;ing, but &s;tronger and more indu&s;trious,
<PB N="394" REF="023972_0401_0FC2A397300BDDA0">
and, of cour&s;e, more able and fit to endure the hard&s;hips of new beginnings. The natural increa&s;e of <HI>New-Eng|land</HI> is not le&s;s than 30,000 <HI>&s;ouls yearly,</HI> and their emigra|tions will be almo&s;t wholly to the <HI>we&s;tward, not</HI> to the <HI>&s;outhward,</HI> for they are generally prejudiced again&s;t the &s;outhern climates.</P>
<P>From all this it appears, that <HI>Philadelphia is as near the centre of the Union, as any point which can be found in the great line of navigation,</HI> and in all probability will continue to be &s;o for at lea&s;t an age or two to come.</P>
<P>II. <HI>Philadelphia</HI> is, and undoubtedly will be acknowledg|ed by every one, the <HI>greate&s;t centre of wealth, trade, navi|gation,</HI> and <HI>intelligence,</HI> both foreign and dome&s;tic, which is any where to be found in the United States: this needs no proof.</P>
<P>III. It is &s;eated on the banks of the river <HI>Delaware,</HI> which is the <HI>be&s;t &s;tation or harbour for &s;hipping</HI> that can be any where found, or even de&s;ired. It has the following qualities or accommodations: 1. It is capable of <HI>ea&s;y</HI> and mo&s;t <HI>impregnable fortification</HI> and defence from the <HI>chaps of Newca&s;tle Bay,</HI> 80 miles from the &s;ea, up to <HI>the city,</HI> which is about 50 miles above the &s;aid chaps. So that, by its di&s;tance from the &s;ea and its defences, it is <HI>perfectly &s;ecure,</HI> or may be ea&s;ily made &s;o, again&s;t any <HI>&s;udden &s;urpri&s;al,</HI> or even <HI>inva&s;ions,</HI> of an enemy. 2. It affords <HI>&s;ufficient water</HI> for any &s;hip that ever was built, as far up as <HI>Wilmington,</HI> which is 15 miles above the &s;aid chaps, and 24 <HI>feet water</HI> from <HI>Wilmington up to the city.</HI> 3. It affords the <HI>be&s;t an|chorage,</HI> and is wholly &s;ecure again&s;t <HI>all winds, tides,</HI> and <HI>&s;torms,</HI> the whole length from the &s;aid chaps up to the city. 4. The common tides ri&s;e and fall about 6 <HI>feet,</HI> which is a great advantage in many re&s;pects. 5. Its waters not only produce no incumbrance <HI>to a &s;hip's bottom,</HI> but in&s;tantly kill <HI>all worms, cockles,</HI> and other <HI>vermin</HI> which may happen to infe&s;t a &s;hip on her fir&s;t arrival from &s;ea. 6. It is fur|ni&s;hed with the <HI>greate&s;t plenty of timber, iron,</HI> and all other <HI>materials</HI> and <HI>&s;tores</HI> for <HI>building, rigging,</HI> and <HI>repairing &s;hips,</HI> and <HI>provi&s;ions</HI> for victualling them. 7. It is furni&s;hed with all natural conveniencies for <HI>dry docks;</HI> which may be built
<PB N="395" REF="023972_0402_0FC2A398B5DAD998">
in &s;ufficient number and extent for every purpo&s;e of <HI>clean|ing &s;hips.</HI> 8. It is <HI>&s;pacious</HI> enough to afford <HI>anchorage</HI> and every other <HI>accommodation</HI> of &s;ecurity for perhaps <HI>all the &s;hips in the world.</HI> 9. The port of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> being the <HI>grand centre</HI> of commercial navigation, will always furni&s;h <HI>plenty of &s;eamen,</HI> and render the <HI>manning</HI> of a navy always <HI>ea&s;y,</HI> or at lea&s;t practicable. The&s;e are the rare, &s;ingular, and excellent advantages of this port and river.</P>
<P>I know of <HI>but one</HI> con&s;iderable <HI>inconvenience,</HI> which can be objected to it, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>the ice u&s;ually &s;tops navigation in the river</HI> about <HI>two months</HI> in the year; but this is in the <HI>mid|dle of winter,</HI> when we rarely wi&s;h to have &s;hips at &s;ea; and if they &s;hould happen to come on the coa&s;t in that &s;ea|&s;on, they may ea&s;ily make a harbour in <HI>New-York</HI> or <HI>Che|&s;apeak Bay;</HI> &s;hips that winter in the river are ea&s;ily <HI>&s;ecured again&s;t any damage from the ice,</HI> as we never have any <HI>floods</HI> which ri&s;e more than a <HI>foot or two</HI> above common high-water.</P>
<P>IV. <HI>Philadelphia</HI> can furni&s;h more <HI>local accommodations</HI> for Congre&s;s, and all the va&s;t number of people who will re&s;ort to the &s;eat of government, than any <HI>other city</HI> in <HI>America.</HI> When compared with any of them, it has more <HI>hou&s;es,</HI> more <HI>inhabitants,</HI> more <HI>riches,</HI> more <HI>churches,</HI> and more <HI>play-hou&s;es,</HI> and quite as <HI>much virtue,</HI> tho' perhaps &s;omewhat <HI>le&s;s &s;ociability,</HI> but <HI>more punctuality</HI> in payments, which is &s;ome indication of <HI>more hone&s;ty.</HI></P>
<P>V. The <HI>climate</HI> is <HI>temperate,</HI> and the <HI>air, good;</HI> the &s;pring and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">all are delightful; the winters mo&s;tly moderate, with no more &s;now or fro&s;t than in nece&s;&s;ary for the conveni|ence of the inhabitants and the growth of vegetables, &amp;c. the <HI>heat</HI> of &s;ummer is <HI>rarely inten&s;e,</HI> and if at any time it becomes violent, it &s;eldom <HI>la&s;ts long;</HI> it is very uncommon to have the Mercury at 90&deg;.</P>
<P>But I &s;uppo&s;e the greate&s;t objection to it is its <HI>numerous population.</HI> I cannot conceive what objection Congre&s;s can have to re&s;iding in <HI>a large city;</HI> their <HI>accommodations</HI> are bet|ter and cheaper, their <HI>intelligence</HI> and <HI>communication</HI> more full and ea&s;y, their <HI>means of information</HI> from conver&s;ation, large libraries, maps, &amp;c. are much greater, and their
<PB N="396" REF="023972_0403_0FC2A39CBB3D5820">
<HI>dignity</HI> and <HI>re&s;pectability</HI> more con&s;picuous than they could po&s;&s;ibly be <HI>in le&s;&s;er places.</HI></P>
<P>I never heard of the lea&s;t inconvenience, which the <HI>Engli&s;h Parliament</HI> ever &s;uffered from &s;itting in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> which is the <HI>mo&s;t populous &s;pot in Europe.</HI> The city of <HI>Rome,</HI> which contained 6,000,000 of people, was the &s;eat of the <HI>Roman</HI> government, and all the inconveniencies which were felt, aro&s;e not from the <HI>continuance</HI> of it there, but from the <HI>removal of it to Con&s;tantinople;</HI> this &s;oon brought on a divi&s;ion of the Empire into Ea&s;tern and We&s;tern, or <HI>Roman</HI> and <HI>Grecian;</HI> which &s;oon terminated in the total ruin, and even extinction, of the We&s;tern Empire; the <HI>courts</HI> of mo&s;t of the States and kingdoms of <HI>Europe</HI> are held in the <HI>mo&s;t populous cities,</HI> without any mi&s;chiefs ari&s;ing from their population that I ever heard of.</P>
<P>But if there are mi&s;chiefs in this, they are unavoidable, for let them fix their &s;eat where they plea&s;e, a <HI>populous city</HI> will &s;oon grow round them, which can never be avoided without <HI>repeated removals.</HI></P>
<P>I never heard of but one inconvenience ari&s;ing from the largene&s;s of the city which is the &s;eat of Congre&s;s, which is this, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>the various allurements and plea&s;ures of the place are apt to divert &s;ome of their Members from their attention to the public bu&s;ine&s;s and their duty in the Hou&s;e;</HI> but this, I conceive, is by no means to be remedied by <HI>running away</HI> from the mi&s;chief, but by <HI>impo&s;ing &s;evere laws on their own Members, and rigidly puni&s;hing, and even expelling,</HI> SUCH <HI>of them as are guilty of any immoral and &s;candalous practices, which reflect di&s;grace on their body, or corrupt their morals or coun&s;els; or</HI> SUCH <HI>who, on any account, neglect their attend|ance and duty in the Hou&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>When per&s;ons appointed to &s;uch high and dignified &s;ta|tions, happen to be &s;o <HI>lo&s;t to all &s;en&s;e of duty, honor, and even &s;hame, as to di&s;grace them&s;elves and the augu&s;t body to which they belong, by levities, debaucheries, negligence of their duty, and of the mo&s;t important intere&s;ts they are appointed to manage,</HI> the&s;e men, I &s;ay, are the proper objects of puni&s;h|ment; and if they cannot be reformed, the honor and &s;afety of the States require that they be expelled from the
<PB N="397" REF="023972_0404_0FC2A3A6A48F3508">
Hou&s;e. And this, I conceive, is the only practicable me|thod of curing the mi&s;chief; and this, if put into proper execution, will very effectually cure it.</P>
<P>It is very manife&s;t that the dignity, the honor, the re|&s;pectability, example, and even univer&s;al vi&s;ible virtue of Congre&s;s are <HI>in their own keeping.</HI> No <HI>other authority</HI> can interpo&s;e to correct a failure in any of the&s;e, unle&s;s it is the <HI>awful tribunal of the pre&s;s,</HI> which is a mo&s;t <HI>dreadful court,</HI> that always multiplies and increa&s;es the mi&s;chief in order to remedy it; and I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, a Congre&s;s of the lea&s;t degree of prudence would take the matter under their <HI>own direction,</HI> in order to prevent <HI>an appeal</HI> to that mo&s;t <HI>&s;overeign,</HI> indeed, but mo&s;t <HI>mortifying</HI> and <HI>di&s;graceful,</HI> of all umpires.</P>
<P>The <HI>virtues and example of Congre&s;s are of infinite import|ance</HI> to the Union. Vices and corruptions <HI>planted in a court</HI> (where they make their fir&s;t appearance with a &s;ort of brilliance, derived from their connection, or at lea&s;t clo&s;e neighbourhood, with the fir&s;t honors of the nation) have a very <HI>high introduction,</HI> and <HI>&s;pread fa&s;t</HI> among the people. Nobody can watch and &s;uppre&s;s the fir&s;t budding of this fruitful &s;ource of evil, more fatal than the opening of <HI>Pan|dora'</HI>s box, but Congre&s;s it&s;elf.</P>
<P>There is no &s;ituation in either town or country, no gran|deur of &s;how or pompous parade, no virtues of a few, no combination of every excellency in the Pre&s;ident, nor any &s;trength, wealth, and maje&s;ty of the States they repre&s;ent, which can give <HI>dignity to Congre&s;s,</HI> &s;o long as the Members have not <HI>virtue</HI> and <HI>di&s;cretion</HI> to <HI>give dignity to them&s;elves,</HI> and <HI>fitne&s;s</HI> to their re&s;olutions. The <HI>vices,</HI> the <HI>negligence,</HI> and even the <HI>levities,</HI> of a <HI>few,</HI> will tarni&s;h the <HI>glory</HI> and le&s;&s;en the <HI>dignity</HI> of that <HI>augu&s;t body,</HI> and dimini&s;h the <HI>con|fidence</HI> of the &s;ubject in them.</P>
<P>Some very extraordinary things which have lately pa&s;&s;ed, induce me to turn my attention to the great principles of economy and delicate morals, which are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;a|ry to be practi&s;ed in an infant State.</P>
<P>I. Any appearance of <HI>pomp, grandeur,</HI> and <HI>magnificence</HI> of <HI>dre&s;s,</HI> of <HI>equipage,</HI> of <HI>buildings,</HI> or of <HI>entertainments</HI> &s;hould be carefully avoided.</P>

Our people being generally of middle rank, have not been accu&s;tomed to the&s;e <HI>grand appearances,</HI> and are apt to think there is &s;omething <HI>foppi&s;h</HI> and <HI>puerile</HI> in them, &s;ome|thing that indicates <HI>weakne&s;s</HI> and <HI>vanity,</HI> or, which is wor&s;e, may imagine they are de&s;igned to exhibit and keep up a &s;ort of <HI>hauteur, loftine&s;s, and pride of &s;tation,</HI> which is to cow down and di&s;pirit the &s;ubject, and depre&s;s him with a &s;en&s;e of his own inferiority, when he comes near the court.</P>
<P N="3">3. Luxuries and levities, magnificence and &s;how, take up <HI>much time, and are incon&s;i&s;tent with that gravity of coun|&s;el, fixed attention, and &s;teady pur&s;uit,</HI> which the great affairs of the nation require of its mini&s;ters; it is well known that hard &s;tudents, or men deeply engaged in pur&s;uit of any kind of bu&s;ine&s;s, neglect all <HI>pageantries,</HI> and generally de|&s;pi&s;e them.</P>
<P N="4">4. All the&s;e appearances are attended <HI>with expen&s;e</HI> which is not only <HI>needle&s;s,</HI> but <HI>hurtful;</HI> as it mu&s;t be a burden either to the <HI>public trea&s;ury,</HI> or to the <HI>individual concerned,</HI> and may probably become a very <HI>bad example of luxury and little pride,</HI> which a young State, like all n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">w beginners, &s;hould ever avoid.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides all this, the great bulk of our citizens are made up of people who &s;et out in the world with <HI>&s;mall begin|nings,</HI> and, by unwearied <HI>indu&s;try and thrift,</HI> have by little and little accumulated the competency they now enjoy. Any <HI>departure</HI> from this line of conduct they have com|monly &s;een followed by <HI>poverty</HI> and <HI>wretchedne&s;s;</HI> &s;uch peo|ple have a high &s;en&s;e of the <HI>value of money,</HI> becau&s;e, by long labor and careful economy, they have <HI>earned</HI> and <HI>pre|&s;erved</HI> it. To people of the&s;e fixed habits, any exce&s;s of <HI>liberal grandeur</HI> and <HI>&s;umptuous parade</HI> mu&s;t appear very <HI>dan|gerous;</HI>
<PB N="399" REF="023972_0406_0FC2A3A9366C82A8">
like a gulf which will &s;oon &s;wallow up all the pub|lic money; this makes them aver&s;e to the payment of taxes or ca&s;h, which is like to be con&s;umed and lo&s;t in prodigal expen&s;es.</P>
<P>More than all this, very great numbers of our people are derived from ance&s;tors, who left their native &s;oil <HI>on account of religion;</HI> who&s;e <HI>devotion and morals</HI> were very &s;evere, and a religious <HI>gravity and au&s;terity of manners</HI> has marked the character of their de&s;cendants ever &s;ince; not &s;o much as a play-hou&s;e could be admitted, till very lately, in the mo&s;t capital cities; and, of cour&s;e, every exce&s;s of <HI>levity, gaiety, dre&s;s, equipage, parties of plea&s;ure, gallantries, amours, &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> appear to &s;uch people like <HI>debauchery, di&s;&s;ipation,</HI> and <HI>corruption of morals,</HI> and prudence directs that not only <HI>evil,</HI> but <HI>all appearance of it,</HI> is to be avoided.</P>
<P>Some re&s;pect &s;hould certainly be paid to the &s;trong <HI>ha|bits, cu&s;toms, tempers,</HI> and <HI>&s;entiments</HI> of any people, by per|&s;ons who re&s;ide among them, e&s;pecially by per&s;ons who have the <HI>management</HI> and <HI>direction</HI> of their mo&s;t <HI>precious and delicate intere&s;ts.</HI> I am &s;ure the gaieties, plea&s;ures, and ex|pen&s;es of <HI>New-York,</HI> &s;ince the new Congre&s;s have re&s;ided there, are the common talk and lamentation of the people where I live; who are not the mo&s;t noted in the world for <HI>rigid manners</HI> or <HI>par&s;imony</HI> of living.</P>
<P>II. Another great article of economy, mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to be ob&s;erved by Congre&s;s and all the States, is the <HI>appoint|ments or emoluments</HI> annexed to all <HI>public offices.</HI> Making money or accumulating fortunes ought not to be the <HI>ruling object</HI> either in tho&s;e who <HI>give,</HI> or tho&s;e who <HI>take,</HI> public offices; the greate&s;t <HI>integrity, learning,</HI> and <HI>official abilities</HI> are commonly found among men who&s;e habits are formed under the practice of <HI>moderate living and prudent economy;</HI> who would very cheerfully accept a public office with <HI>very moderate</HI> emoluments, and execute it in the <HI>be&s;t manner.</HI></P>
<P>An <HI>abundant &s;ufficiency</HI> of men of this ca&s;t may be found in the Union, who&s;e <HI>mediocrity of de&s;ires</HI> and <HI>prudent econo|my</HI> will enable them to afford very well to accept the place on moderate terms; and who&s;e habits of indu&s;try, &s;teadi|ne&s;s,
<PB N="400" REF="023972_0407_0FC2A3AAADF13330">
and integrity will almo&s;t in&s;ure a faithful and proper performance of the duties of it.</P>
<P>What madne&s;s is it then to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> by</HI> this &s;ort of men, and <HI>offer</HI> the public offices to men of either &s;uch <HI>great fortunes</HI> or <HI>great bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI> that they cannot afford to attend to the duties of them, without very <HI>great emoluments?</HI> To hear men talk in Congre&s;s of the &s;acrifices of fortune which they make by accepting their places, rai&s;es my indigna|tion; not again&s;t the <HI>impatient &s;ufferer</HI> &s;o much, indeed, as again&s;t the <HI>fools</HI> who appointed him, who, I conceive, made much greater &s;acrifices of <HI>their common &s;en&s;e</HI> in giv|ing him the place, than he did of <HI>his money</HI> in accepting it.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, where a man's <HI>wants are &s;upplied by his diligence,</HI> he will naturally be very <HI>indu&s;trious and per&s;evering;</HI> but it is commonly found that indu&s;try is very apt to abate, where the occa&s;ions of it are le&s;&s;ened or removed. I do not know a more effectual way to <HI>&s;poil a public officer,</HI> than making him <HI>too rich;</HI> &s;uch a man is apt to turn over the public concerns to <HI>clerks</HI> or <HI>&s;ubalterns,</HI> and to devote more of his time to <HI>indolence</HI> or <HI>plea&s;ures,</HI> than to the <HI>bu&s;ine&s;s</HI> of his office.</P>
<P>Whether any of the&s;e ob&s;ervations will apply to the com|pen&s;ations which Congre&s;s have voted to them&s;elves, the great officers of &s;tate, the collectors and officers of the re|venue, the door-keepers, and &s;undry other public officers, I leave to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed another time; without going into any detail of that matter at pre&s;ent, I have only to &s;ay, that the compen&s;ations are generally deemed (by people I have conver&s;ed with) to be about <HI>double</HI> of what they ought to be, in order <HI>to in&s;ure the bu&s;ine&s;s of the re&s;pective offices to be well done;</HI> and as they are amazingly higher than the States of the Union in general allow to their officers of a &s;imilar nature, I &s;uppo&s;e they will be thought exce&s;&s;ive, and, of cour&s;e, will be complained of, and probably viewed with unea&s;ine&s;s and di&s;&s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>Certainly the extravagancies of the courts of <HI>Europe</HI> in this re&s;pect are no kind of <HI>rule</HI> for us, and I think any gen|tleman might be a&s;hamed to quote their example (which is and ever has been univer&s;ally exploded in <HI>America</HI>) as a
<PB N="401" REF="023972_0408_0FC2A3AD942FA9E0">
rea&s;on why we &s;hould <HI>imitate</HI> it. But it may be noted, that no compen&s;ations allowed in <HI>Europe</HI> or <HI>America</HI> to the Members of any <HI>Parliament, Diet, States General, A&s;&s;em|bly,</HI> or any <HI>other body</HI> &s;imilar to that of Congre&s;s, ever were <HI>one-third</HI> of what Congre&s;s have granted to <HI>them&s;elves;</HI> at lea&s;t this is true as far as I could ever gain information of the matter.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e they give no credit for the <HI>honor</HI> of their &s;ta|tions, their <HI>acquaintance</HI> with all the capital characters in <HI>America,</HI> and all tho&s;e of <HI>Europe,</HI> which repair to the fede|ral court, their <HI>information</HI> of the &s;tate and principle of the manufactures, agriculture, commerce, and policies of all the States of the Union, the opportunities they acquire of &s;erving their children and friends, and the <HI>con&s;equence</HI> which their re&s;idence in Congre&s;s will ever after give to <HI>them</HI> and their <HI>families</HI> in their re&s;pective States, whenever they &s;hall return home. I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e <HI>all</HI> the&s;e advantages, or even <HI>any one</HI> of them, would be compen&s;ation enough for a few months' re&s;idence in Congre&s;s, without <HI>any money</HI> at all; e&s;pecially if their <HI>&s;imple and nece&s;&s;ary</HI> expen&s;es were born by the public into the bargain.</P>
<P>III. <HI>Economy</HI> ab&s;olutely requires the <HI>payment of the public debts,</HI> at lea&s;t the annual or half-yearly intere&s;t of them; the public would derive greater advantages from this, by the <HI>general animation</HI> of every &s;ort of bu&s;ine&s;s it would pro|duce, than would <HI>compen&s;ate the burden</HI> of rai&s;ing the mo|ney to do it, even if we pay no regard to the <HI>public ju&s;tice, honor, credit, morality, gratitude,</HI> and <HI>even compa&s;&s;ion,</HI> which all con&s;pire to enforce the &s;ame mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>But if all this cannot be done at pre&s;ent, enough may doubtle&s;s be done to &s;atisfy the <HI>original holders</HI> of the pub|lic &s;ecurities, who are manife&s;tly the mo&s;t <HI>meritorious,</HI> as well as the <HI>greate&s;t, &s;ufferers,</HI> and the mo&s;t <HI>di&s;tre&s;&s;ed</HI> and <HI>ru|ined</HI> by the <HI>public defaults of any among us;</HI> but I touched on this before, and it is needle&s;s to add more on this drea|ry &s;ubject in this place.</P>
<P>IV. Economy requires that the public monies &s;hould be rai&s;ed in that way that is <HI>ea&s;ie&s;t to the people, and lea&s;t trou|ble&s;ome, di&s;gu&s;ting, and expen&s;ive in the collection;</HI> an impo&s;t
<PB N="402" REF="023972_0409_0FC2A3BB8F8392A8">
on <HI>imported luxuries</HI> and articles of <HI>unnece&s;&s;ary</HI> con&s;umption, but ju&s;t <HI>high enough</HI> to reduce the <HI>exce&s;&s;ive</HI> u&s;e of them down to that degree, which is mo&s;t conducive to the <HI>health, morals,</HI> and <HI>wealth</HI> of our people, together with the <HI>&s;mall impo&s;t</HI> on other articles already a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, will, I con|ceive, produce all the &s;upplies which the public exigences require; the collection of all this will be <HI>cheap and ea&s;y; a few officers in the places of navigation</HI> will be &s;ufficient; and the importers who pay the duty, will be <HI>few,</HI> and will all be <HI>reimbur&s;ed</HI> in their &s;ales.</P>
<P>But <HI>a general exci&s;e</HI> (which, I hear, is in contemplation) will require an almo&s;t <HI>infinite number of officers,</HI> who&s;e <HI>pay</HI> will amount to <HI>va&s;t &s;ums,</HI> and who&s;e <HI>duty</HI> will be of the <HI>mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;ting and mortifying kind</HI> to the people; for my part, I had rather pay a <HI>dollar a gallon,</HI> impo&s;t duty, on all the &s;pirits and wines I con&s;ume, than &s;uffer the <HI>mortify|ing intru&s;ions of an exci&s;e-officer,</HI> to examine my <HI>liquors,</HI> tho' his demand was but <HI>a &s;hilling;</HI> and after all, it will be to|tally <HI>impo&s;&s;ible to collect</HI> this duty in the exterior parts of the States with any kind of general uniformity and equality, as all experience has ever made manife&s;t. But I have treated this more fully <HI>in my Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh E&s;|&s;ays on Free Trade and Finance,</HI> to which I refer any body who wi&s;hes to &s;ee my &s;entiments on this &s;ubject more fully explained.</P>
<P>I write with the mo&s;t <HI>unlimited freedom,</HI> and I expect the <HI>candor</HI> of my countrymen; if my &s;entiments are <HI>wrong, condemn them;</HI> if <HI>right, approve and adopt them;</HI> it is not <HI>an itch of writing</HI> which impels me, but <HI>a zeal for a good government and a wi&s;e admini&s;tration</HI> prompts me to write, and dictates every line. I lament that any one advantage of my country &s;hould be <HI>lo&s;t</HI> for want of <HI>proper manage|ment,</HI> or that we &s;hould ever incur the old cen&s;ure of <HI>fools,</HI> having a <HI>price</HI> put into their hands, but no <HI>hearts</HI> to im|prove it. May Heaven direct our public coun&s;els, and give pro&s;perity and e&s;tabli&s;hment to our union.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">[Fir&s;t publi&s;hed in Philadelphia, October 12, 1787.]</HEAD>
<P>I AM now to con&s;ider the objections of our &s;ixteen Members to the <HI>New Con&s;titution</HI> it&s;elf, which is much the mo&s;t important part that lies on me.</P>
<P N="1">1. Their fir&s;t objection is, that the government propo&s;ed will be <HI>too expen&s;ive.</HI> I an&s;wer, that if the appointments
<PB N="404" REF="023972_0411_0FC2A3BE35617378">
of offices are not more, and the compen&s;ations or emolu|ments of office not greater, than is nece&s;&s;ary, the expen&s;e will be by no means burden&s;ome, and this mu&s;t be left to the prudence of Congre&s;s; for I know of no way to con|trol &s;upreme powers from extravagance in this re&s;pect. Doubtle&s;s many in&s;tances may be produced of many need|le&s;s offices being created, and many inferior officers, who receive far greater emoluments of office than the fir&s;t Pre|&s;ident of the State.</P>
<P N="2">2. Their next objection is again&s;t a <HI>legi&s;lature con&s;i&s;ting of three branches.</HI> This is &s;o far from an objection, that I con&s;ider it as an advantage. The mo&s;t weighty and im|portant affairs of the Union mu&s;t be tran&s;acted in Con|gre&s;s; the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential coun&s;els mu&s;t be there decided, which mu&s;t all go thro' three &s;everal di&s;cu&s;&s;ions in three dif|ferent chambers (all equally competent to the &s;ubject and equally governed by the &s;ame motives and intere&s;ts, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the good of the great Commonwealth, and the approbation of the people) before any deci&s;ion can be made; and when di&s;putes are very high, different di&s;cu&s;&s;ions are nece&s;|&s;ary, becau&s;e they afford time for all parties to cool and re|con&s;ider.</P>
<P>This appears to me to be a very &s;afe way, and a very likely method to prevent any &s;udden and undige&s;ted re&s;olu|tions from pa&s;&s;ing; and tho' it may delay, or even de&s;troy, a good bill, will hardly admit the pa&s;&s;ing of a bad one, which is by far the wor&s;t evil of the two. But if all this cannot &s;top the cour&s;e of a bad bill, the negative of the Pre&s;ident will at lea&s;t give it further embarra&s;&s;ment, will furni&s;h all the new light which a mo&s;t &s;erious di&s;cu&s;&s;ion in a third Hou&s;e can give, and will make a new di&s;cu&s;&s;ion nece&s;&s;ary in each of the other two, where every member will have an opportunity to revi&s;e his opinion, to correct his arguments, and bring his judgment to the greate&s;t ma|turity po&s;&s;ible: if all this can not keep the public deci&s;ion within the bounds of wi&s;dom, natural fitne&s;s, right, and convenience, it will be hard to find any efforts of human wi&s;dom that can do it.</P>
<P><PB N="405" REF="023972_0412_0FC2A3C2015333F0">
I believe it would be difficult to find a man in the Uni|on, who would not readily con&s;ent to have Congre&s;s ve&s;ted with all the va&s;t powers propo&s;ed by the New Con&s;titution, if he could be &s;ure that tho&s;e powers would be exerci&s;ed with wi&s;dom, ju&s;tice, and propriety, and not be abu&s;ed; and I do not &s;ee that greater precautions and guards again&s;t abu&s;es can well be devi&s;ed, or more effectual methods u&s;ed to throw every degree of light on every &s;ubject of debate, or more powerful motives to a rea&s;onable and hone&s;t deci|&s;ion can be &s;et before the minds of Congre&s;s, than are here propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>And if this is the be&s;t that can be obtained, it ought in all prudence to be adopted till better appears, rather than to be rejected merely becau&s;e it is human, not perfect, and may be abu&s;ed. At any rate I think it very plain that our chance of a right deci&s;ion in a Congre&s;s of three branches, is much greater than in one of a &s;ingle chamber: but how|ever all this may be, I cannot &s;ee the lea&s;t tendency in a Legi&s;lature of three branches to increa&s;e the burdens or taxes of the people. I think it very evident that any propo&s;ition of extravagant expen&s;e would be checked and embarra&s;&s;ed in &s;uch an A&s;&s;embly, more than in a &s;ingle Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Further, the two Hou&s;es being by their election take<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> from the body of the States, and being them&s;elves princi|pal inhabitants, will naturally have the intere&s;t of the Com|monwealth &s;incerely at heart, their principle mu&s;t be the &s;ame, their differences mu&s;t be (if any) in the mode of pur&s;uing it, or ari&s;e from local attachments; I &s;ay, the great intere&s;t of their country, and the e&s;teem, confidence, and approbation of their fellow-citizens, mu&s;t be &s;trong governing principles in both Hou&s;es, as well as in the Pre|&s;ident him&s;elf.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide this &s;ubject fully di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in my Di&s;&s;ertation on that Con&s;titution which is nece&s;&s;ary for the United States, page 198.</NOTE></P>
<P N="3">3. Another objection is, that the Con&s;titution propo&s;ed will <HI>annihilate the State-governments, or reduce them to mere corporations.</HI> I take it that this objection is thrown out
<PB N="406" REF="023972_0413_0FC2A3C3782F7410">
(merely <HI>invidiae cau&s;a</HI>) without the lea&s;t ground for it; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">or I do not find <HI>one article</HI> of the Con&s;titution propo&s;ed, which ve&s;ts <HI>Congre&s;s,</HI> or <HI>any of their officers</HI> or <HI>courts,</HI> with a pow|er <HI>to interfere in the lea&s;t in the internal police or government of any one State,</HI> when the intere&s;ts of <HI>&s;ome other State,</HI> or <HI>&s;trangers,</HI> or <HI>the Union</HI> in general, are <HI>not concerned;</HI> and in all &s;uch ca&s;es it is ab&s;olutely and manife&s;tly nece&s;&s;ary that Congre&s;s &s;hould have <HI>a controlling power,</HI> otherwi&s;e there would be <HI>no end of controver&s;ies and injuries</HI> between <HI>different States,</HI> nor any <HI>&s;afety</HI> for <HI>individuals,</HI> nor any po&s;&s;i|bility <HI>of &s;upporting the Union</HI> with any tolerable degree of honor, &s;trength, or &s;ecurity.</P>
<P N="4">4. Another objection is again&s;t the <HI>power of taxation ve&s;ted in Congre&s;s.</HI> But I an&s;wer, this is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;a|ry and unavoidable, from the nece&s;&s;ity of the ca&s;e; I know it is a <HI>tender point,</HI> a <HI>va&s;t power,</HI> and a <HI>terrible engine of op|pre&s;&s;ion</HI> and <HI>tyranny,</HI> when <HI>wantonly, injudiciou&s;ly,</HI> or <HI>wick|edly u&s;ed,</HI> but <HI>mu&s;t be admitted;</HI> for it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;up|port the Union, or indeed any government, <HI>without ex|pen&s;e</HI>&mdash;the Congre&s;s are the <HI>proper judges</HI> of that expen&s;e, the <HI>amount</HI> of it, and the be&s;t <HI>means</HI> of &s;upplying it; the <HI>&s;afety</HI> of the States <HI>ab&s;olutely requires</HI> that this power be lodged <HI>&s;omewhere,</HI> and no <HI>other body</HI> can have the lea&s;t pre|ten&s;ions to it; and <HI>no part</HI> of the re&s;ources of the States can, with any &s;afety, be <HI>exempt,</HI> when the <HI>exigencies</HI> of the Union or government require their <HI>utmo&s;t exertion.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>&s;tronger we make our government,</HI> the <HI>greater protec|tion it can afford us,</HI> and the <HI>greater</HI> will our <HI>&s;afety be</HI> under it.</P>
<P>It is ea&s;y enough here to harangue on the <HI>arts of a court</HI> to create occa&s;ions for money, or the unbounded <HI>ex|travagance</HI> with which they can &s;pend it; but all this not|with&s;tanding, we mu&s;t take our courts as we do our wives, <HI>for better or for wor&s;e.</HI> We hope the be&s;t of an <HI>American Congre&s;s,</HI> but if they di&s;appoint us, we cannot help it; it is in vain to try to form any plan of <HI>avoiding the frailties</HI> of human nature.&mdash;Would any man choo&s;e a <HI>lame</HI> hor&s;e l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t a <HI>&s;ound</HI> one &s;hould run away with him? or will any man prefer a <HI>&s;mall tent</HI> to live in, before a <HI>large hou&s;e,</HI> which
<PB N="407" REF="023972_0414_0FC2A3CA5BB3FEC8">
may <HI>fall down</HI> and <HI>cru&s;h him</HI> in its ruins? No man has any right to find fault with this article, till he can &s;ub&s;ti|tute a better in its room.</P>
<P>The &s;ixteen Members attempt to aggravate the horrors of this devouring power, by &s;ugge&s;ting the rigid &s;everity with which Congre&s;s, with their <HI>faithful &s;oldiers,</HI> will <HI>exact and collect</HI> the taxes. This picture, &s;tripped of its <HI>black drapery,</HI> amounts to ju&s;t this, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that whatever taxes are laid will be collected, without exception, from every per|&s;on charged with them, which mu&s;t look di&s;agreeable, I &s;uppo&s;e, to people who, by one &s;hift or another, have a|voided paying taxes all their lives.</P>
<P>But it is a plain truth, and will be obvious to any body who duly con&s;iders it, that nothing can be more ruinous to a <HI>State,</HI> or oppre&s;&s;ive to <HI>individuals,</HI> than a <HI>partial and dila|tory collection</HI> of taxes, e&s;pecially where the tax is an impo&s;t or exci&s;e, becau&s;e the man who <HI>avoids</HI> the tax, can <HI>under|&s;ell,</HI> and con&s;equently <HI>ruin,</HI> him who <HI>pays</HI> it, <HI>i. e.</HI> &s;mug|gling ruins the fair trader, and a <HI>remedy</HI> of this mi&s;chief, I cannot &s;uppo&s;e, will be deemed by our people in general &s;uch a <HI>very awful judgment,</HI> as the &s;ixteen Members would make us believe their con&s;tituents will con&s;ider it to be.</P>
<P N="5">5. They object, that the <HI>liberty of the pre&s;s is not a&s;&s;erted</HI> in the Con&s;titution. I an&s;wer, neither are any of the <HI>ten commandments,</HI> but I do not think, that it follows that it was the de&s;ign of the Convention to &s;acrifice either <HI>the one</HI> or <HI>the other</HI> to contempt, or to leave them void of protec|tion and effectual &s;upport.</P>
<P N="6">6. It is objected further, that the Con&s;titution contains <HI>no declaration of rights.</HI> I an&s;wer, this is not true: the Con&s;titution contains a declaration of many rights, and ve|ry important ones, <HI>e. g.</HI> that people &s;hall be obliged to <HI>fulfil their contracts,</HI> and <HI>not avoid</HI> them by <HI>tenders</HI> of any thing le&s;s than the value &s;tipulated; that no <HI>ex po&s;t fact<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> laws &s;hall be made, &amp;c. but it was no part of the bu&s;i|ne&s;s of their appointment to make <HI>a code of laws;</HI> it was &s;ufficient <HI>to fix the Con&s;titution right,</HI> and that would pave the way for the mo&s;t effectual &s;ecurity of the rights of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="408" REF="023972_0415_0FC2A3D53B732590">
7. They further object, that no provi&s;ion is made again&s;t a <HI>&s;tanding army in time of peace.</HI> I an&s;wer, that a &s;tanding army, <HI>i. e.</HI> regular troops, are often nece&s;&s;ary in time of peace, to prevent a war, to guard again&s;t &s;udden inva&s;ions, for garri&s;on-duty, to quell mobs and riots, as guards to Congre&s;s and perhaps other courts, &amp;c. &amp;c. as military &s;chools to keep up the knowledge and habits of military di&s;cipline and exerci&s;e, &amp;c. &amp;c. and as the power of rai&s;|ing troops is rightfully and without objection ve&s;ted in Congre&s;s, &s;o they are the <HI>propere&s;t and be&s;t judges</HI> of the <HI>number</HI> requi&s;ite, and the <HI>occa&s;ion, time,</HI> and <HI>manner</HI> of em|ploying them; if they are not wanted on military duty, they may be employed in making <HI>public roads, fortifications,</HI> or any other <HI>public works:</HI> they need not be an <HI>u&s;ele&s;s bur|den</HI> to the States: and for all this the prudence of Con|gre&s;s mu&s;t be tru&s;ted, and nobody can have a right to ob|ject to this, till they can point out &s;ome way of doing bet|ter.</P>
<P N="8">8. Another objection is, that the New Con&s;titution <HI>abo|li&s;hes trial by jury in civil cau&s;es.</HI> I an&s;wer, I do not &s;ee one word in the Con&s;titution, which, by any candid con&s;truc|tion, can &s;upport even the remote&s;t &s;u&s;picion that this ever entered in the heart of one Member of the Convention: I therefore &s;et down the &s;ugge&s;tion for &s;heer malice, and &s;o di&s;mi&s;s it.</P>
<P N="9">9. Another objection is, that the federal <HI>judiciary is &s;o con&s;tructed as to de&s;troy the judiciaries of the &s;everal States,</HI> and that the <HI>appellate juri&s;diction, with re&s;pect to law and fact, is unnece&s;&s;ary.</HI> I an&s;wer, both the <HI>original</HI> and <HI>appel|late</HI> juri&s;diction of the federal judiciary are manife&s;tly ne|ce&s;&s;ary, where the cau&s;e of action affects the citizens of <HI>different</HI> States, the <HI>general intere&s;t</HI> of the Union, or <HI>&s;tran|gers</HI> (and to ca&s;es of <HI>the&s;e de&s;criptions only</HI> does the <HI>juri&s;dic|diction</HI> of the federal judiciary <HI>extend</HI>) I &s;ay, the&s;e juri&s;dic|tions of the federal judiciary are manife&s;tly nece&s;&s;ary for the rea&s;ons ju&s;t now given under the third objection.</P>
<P>I do not &s;ee how they can avoid trying any i&s;&s;ues joined before them, whether the thing to be decided is <HI>law</HI> or
<PB N="409" REF="023972_0416_0FC2A3D664D755E0">
<HI>fact;</HI> but I think no doubt can be made, that if the i&s;&s;ue joined is on <HI>fact,</HI> it mu&s;t be tried by a jury.</P>
<P N="10">10. They object, that the <HI>election of Delegates</HI> for the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives <HI>is for two years,</HI> and of Senators, <HI>for &s;ix years.</HI> I think this a manife&s;t <HI>advantage,</HI> rather than an <HI>objection.</HI> Very great inconveniences mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily ari&s;e from a too frequent change of the Members of large legi&s;lative or executive bodies, where the revi&s;ion of every pa&s;t tran&s;action mu&s;t be taken up, explained, and di&s;cu&s;&s;ed anew for the information of the new Members; where the &s;ettled rules of the Hou&s;e are little under&s;tood by them, &amp;c. &amp;c. all which ought to be avoided, if it can be with &s;afety.</P>
<P>Further, it is plain that any man who &s;erves in &s;uch bo|dies, is better qualified the &s;econd year than he could be the fir&s;t, becau&s;e experience adds qualifications for every bu&s;ine&s;s, &amp;c. the only objection is, that long continuance affords danger of corruption, but for this the Con&s;titution provides a remedy by impeachment and expul&s;ion, which will be a &s;ufficient re&s;traint, unle&s;s a majority of the Hou&s;e and Senate &s;hould become corrupt, which is not ea&s;ily pre|&s;umable: in fine, there is a <HI>certain mean</HI> between too <HI>long</HI> and too <HI>&s;hort</HI> continuances of Members in Congre&s;s, and I cannot &s;ee but it is judiciou&s;ly fixed by the Convention.</P>
<P>Upon the whole matter, I think the &s;ixteen Members have employed <HI>an addre&s;s-writer</HI> of great dexterity, who has given us a &s;trong &s;ample of <HI>ingenious malignity and ill-nature</HI>&mdash;a ma&s;terpiece of <HI>high coloring</HI> in the <HI>&s;care-crow way;</HI> in his account of the conduct of the &s;ixteen Mem|bers, by an unexpected openne&s;s and candor, he avows <HI>facts</HI> which he certainly cannot expect to ju&s;tify, or even hope that their con&s;tituents will patronize or even approve, but he &s;eems to lo&s;e all candor when he deals <HI>in &s;entiments;</HI> when he comes to point out the <HI>nature</HI> and <HI>operation</HI> of the <HI>New Con&s;titution,</HI> he appears to mi&s;take the <HI>&s;pirit</HI> and <HI>true principles</HI> of it very much; or, which is wor&s;e, takes plea|&s;ure in &s;howing it in the <HI>wor&s;t light</HI> he can paint it in.</P>
<P>I however agree with him in this, 'that this is <HI>the time for con&s;ideration and minute examination;'</HI> and, I think, the
<PB N="410" REF="023972_0417_0FC2A3D7C08A4288">
great &s;ubject, when viewed &s;eriou&s;ly, without pa&s;&s;ion or prejudice, will <HI>bear,</HI> and <HI>brighten under, the &s;evere&s;t examina|tion</HI> of the rational inquirer. If the <HI>provi&s;ions</HI> of the law or Con&s;titution do not exceed the <HI>occa&s;ions,</HI> if the <HI>remedies</HI> are not extended beyond the <HI>mi&s;chiefs,</HI> the government can|not be ju&s;tly charged with <HI>&s;everity;</HI> on the other hand, if the provi&s;ions are not <HI>adequate</HI> to the occa&s;ions, and the remedies <HI>not equal to</HI> the mi&s;chiefs, the government mu&s;t b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>too lax,</HI> and not &s;ufficiently operative to give the nece&s;|&s;ary <HI>&s;ecurity</HI> to the &s;ubject: to form a right judgment, we mu&s;t compare the&s;e two things well together, and not &s;uf|fer our minds to dwell on one of them alone, without con&s;idering it in <HI>connexion</HI> with the other; by this means we &s;hall ea&s;ily &s;ee that the one makes the other nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Were we to view only the <HI>gaols</HI> and <HI>dungeons,</HI> the <HI>gal|lows</HI> and <HI>pillories,</HI> the <HI>chains</HI> and <HI>wheel-barrows,</HI> of any State, we might be induced to think the government <HI>&s;evere;</HI> but when we turn our attention to the <HI>murders</HI> and <HI>parri|cides,</HI> the <HI>robberies</HI> and <HI>burglaries,</HI> the <HI>piracies</HI> and <HI>thefts, which merit the&s;e puni&s;hments,</HI> our idea of <HI>cruelty</HI> vani&s;hes at once, and we admire the <HI>ju&s;tice,</HI> and perhaps <HI>clemency,</HI> of that government, which before <HI>&s;hocked</HI> us as too &s;evere.</P>
<P>So when we fix our attention only on the <HI>&s;uperlative au|thority</HI> and <HI>energetic force</HI> ve&s;ted in Congre&s;s, and our federal executive powers by the New Con&s;titution, we may at fir&s;t &s;ight be induced to think that we yield more of the <HI>&s;ove|reignty of the States</HI> and of <HI>per&s;onal liberty,</HI> than is requi&s;ite to maintain the federal government; but when, on the other hand, we con&s;ider with full &s;urvey the <HI>va&s;t &s;upports</HI> which the union requires, and the <HI>immen&s;e con&s;equence of that</HI> UNION to us all, we &s;hall probably &s;oon be convinced that the powers afore&s;aid, <HI>exten&s;ive</HI> as they are, are not <HI>greater</HI> than is nece&s;&s;ary for our benefit: for,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>No laws of any State, which do not carry in them a force which extends to their effectual and final execution, can afford a certain and &s;ufficient &s;ecurity to the &s;ubject;</HI> for,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Laws of any kind, which fail of execution, are wor&s;e than none,</HI> becau&s;e they <HI>weaken</HI> the government, expo&s;e it to <HI>contempt,</HI> de&s;troy the <HI>confidence</HI> of all men, both &s;ubjects
<PB N="411" REF="023972_0418_0FC2A3DBCC3CE770">
and &s;trangers, in it, and <HI>di&s;appoint</HI> all men who have <HI>con|fided in it.</HI></P>
<P>In fine, <HI>our union</HI> can never be &s;upported without <HI>definite</HI> and <HI>effectual</HI> laws, which are co-exten&s;ive with their occa|&s;ions, and which are &s;upported by authorities and powers which can give them <HI>execution with energy;</HI> if admitting &s;uch powers into our Con&s;titution can be called a <HI>&s;acrifice,</HI> it is a <HI>&s;acrifice to &s;afety,</HI> and the only que&s;tion is, whether our UNION or federal government is worth this &s;acrifice.</P>
<P><HI>Our</HI> UNION, I &s;ay, <HI>under the protection of which</HI> every individual re&s;ts &s;ecure again&s;t <HI>foreign</HI> and <HI>dome&s;tic</HI> in&s;ult and oppre&s;&s;ion; but <HI>without it</HI> we can have no &s;ecurity again&s;t inva&s;ions, in&s;ults, and oppre&s;&s;ions of <HI>foreign powers,</HI> or a|gain&s;t the inroads and wars of <HI>one State on another,</HI> or even again&s;t <HI>in&s;urrections</HI> and <HI>rebellions</HI> ari&s;ing within particular States, by which our wealth and &s;trength, as well as ea&s;e, comfort, and &s;afety, will be devoured and de&s;troyed by <HI>ene|mies growing out of our own bowels.</HI></P>
<P>It is <HI>our</HI> UNION <HI>alone</HI> which can give us <HI>re&s;pectability abroad</HI> in the eyes of foreign nations, and &s;ecure to us all the advantages both of <HI>trade</HI> and <HI>&s;afety,</HI> which can be de|rived from <HI>treaties with them.</HI></P>
<P>The Thirteen States all united and well cemented toge|ther, are a <HI>&s;trong, rich,</HI> and <HI>formidable</HI> body, not of <HI>&s;tati|onary,</HI> maturated power, but <HI>increa&s;ing</HI> every day in riches, &s;trength, and numbers.</P>
<P>Thus circum&s;tanced, we can demand the attention and re&s;pect of all foreign nations, but they will give us both in <HI>exact proportion</HI> to the <HI>&s;olidity of our union:</HI> for if they ob&s;erve our <HI>union</HI> to be <HI>lax,</HI> from <HI>in&s;ufficient</HI> principles of cement in our <HI>Con&s;titution,</HI> or <HI>mutinies</HI> and <HI>in&s;urrections</HI> of our own people (which are the direct con&s;equence of an <HI>in&s;ufficient cement of union</HI>) I &s;ay, when foreign nations &s;ee either of the&s;e, they will immediately <HI>abate</HI> of their <HI>atten|tion</HI> and <HI>re&s;pect</HI> to us, and <HI>confidence</HI> in us.</P>
<P>And as it appears to me, that the New Con&s;titution does not ve&s;t Congre&s;s with <HI>more</HI> or <HI>greater</HI> powers than are ne|ce&s;&s;ary to &s;upport this <HI>important union,</HI> I wi&s;h it may be ad|mitted

in the mo&s;t <HI>cordial</HI> and <HI>unanimous</HI> manner by all the States.</P>
<P>It is a <HI>human</HI> compo&s;ition, and may have <HI>errors</HI> which future experience will enable us to di&s;cover and correct; but I think it is pretty plain, if it has faults, that the ad|dre&s;s-writer of the &s;ixteen Members has not been able to find them; for he has all along either hunted down <HI>phan|toms of error,</HI> that have no <HI>real exi&s;tence,</HI> or, which is wor&s;e, <HI>tarni&s;hed real excellencies</HI> into <HI>blemi&s;hes.</HI></P>
<P>I have dwelt the longer on the&s;e remarks of this writer, becau&s;e I ob&s;erve that all the &s;cribblers in our papers again&s;t the New Con&s;titution, have taken their cue principally from him; all their lucubrations contain little more than <HI>his ideas</HI> dre&s;&s;ed out in a great variety of forms; one of which colors &s;o high as to make the New Con&s;titution &s;trongly re&s;emble the <HI>Turki&s;h government</HI> (vide Gazetteer of the 10th in&s;tant) which, I think, comes about as near the truth as any of the re&s;t, and brings to my mind a &s;en|timent in polemical divinity, which I have &s;omewhere read, that there were once great di&s;putes and different opinions among divines about the <HI>mark which was &s;et on Cain,</HI> when one of them very gravely thought it was a <HI>horn fully grown out on his forehead.</HI> It is probable he could not think of a <HI>wor&s;e mark</HI> than that.</P>
<P>On the whole matter, there is no end of the extravagan|cies of the human fancy, which are commonly dictated by <HI>poignant feelings, di&s;ordered pa&s;&s;ions,</HI> or <HI>affecting intere&s;ts;</HI> but I could wi&s;h my fellow-citizens, in the matter of va&s;t importance before us, would dive&s;t them&s;elves of bias, pa&s;&s;ion, and <HI>little per&s;onal</HI> or <HI>local intere&s;ts,</HI> and con&s;ider the great &s;ubject with that dignity of rea&s;on, and independence of &s;entiment, which national intere&s;ts ever require.</P>
<P>I have here given my &s;entiments with the mo&s;t unbia&s;|&s;ed freedom, and hope they will be received with the mo&s;t candid attention and unbia&s;&s;ed di&s;cu&s;&s;ion by the State in which <HI>I live,</HI> and in which I expect <HI>to leave my children.</HI></P>
<P>I will conclude with one ob&s;ervation, which I take to be very capital, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that the di&s;tre&s;&s;es and oppre&s;&s;ions, both of nations and individuals, often ari&s;e from the <HI>powers of

<P><PB N="414" REF="023972_0421_0FC2A3E8527192A8">
HIS fir&s;t que&s;tion is, <HI>Whether a confederated government is be&s;t for the United States?</HI></P>
<P>I an&s;wer,&mdash;If <HI>Brutus,</HI> or any body el&s;e, cannot find any <HI>benefit</HI> re&s;ulting from the <HI>union of the Thirteen States;</HI> if they can do <HI>without</HI> as well as <HI>with</HI> the re&s;pectability, the protection, and the &s;ecurity, which the States may derive from that union, I have nothing further to &s;ay: but if <HI>that union</HI> is to be <HI>&s;upported</HI> in any &s;uch manner as to afford re|&s;pectability, protection, or &s;ecurity to the States, I &s;ay it mu&s;t be done by an <HI>adequate government,</HI> and cannot be <HI>otherwi&s;e done.</HI></P>
<P>This government mu&s;t have a &s;upreme power, <HI>&s;uperior to and able to control</HI> each and all of its parts. It is e&s;&s;ential to all government, that <HI>&s;uch a power be &s;omewhere exi&s;ting in it;</HI> and if <HI>the place</HI> where the propo&s;ed Con&s;titution has fixed it, does not &s;uit <HI>Brutus</HI> and his friends, I will give him leave to &s;tow it away in any <HI>other place that is better:</HI> but I will not con&s;ent to have it <HI>annihilated;</HI> neither will I agree to have it <HI>cramped and pinched</HI> for room, &s;o as to <HI>le&s;&s;en</HI> its energy; for that will <HI>de&s;troy</HI> both its nature and u&s;e.</P>
<P>The &s;upreme power of government ought to be <HI>full, de|finite, e&s;tabli&s;hed,</HI> and <HI>acknowledged.</HI> Powers of government <HI>too limited,</HI> or <HI>uncertain</HI> and <HI>di&s;puted,</HI> have ever proved, like <HI>Pandora'</HI>s box, a mo&s;t fruitful &s;ource of quarrels, animo&s;i|ties, wars, deva&s;tation, and ruin, in all &s;hapes and degrees, in all communities, &s;tates, and kingdoms on earth.</P>
<P>Nothing tends more to the <HI>honor, e&s;tabli&s;hment,</HI> and <HI>peace</HI> of &s;ociety, than <HI>public deci&s;ions,</HI> grounded on principles of <HI>right, natural fitne&s;s, and prudence;</HI> but when the powers of government are <HI>too limited,</HI> &s;uch deci&s;ions cannot be <HI>made and enforced;</HI> &s;o the mi&s;chief goes without a remedy: dreadful examples of which we have felt, in in&s;tances more than enough, for &s;even years pa&s;t.</P>

<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary in States, as well as in private families, that controver&s;ies &s;hould have a ju&s;t, <HI>&s;peedy,</HI> and effectual deci&s;ion, that right may be done before the contention has <HI>time</HI> to grow up into habits of malignity, re&s;entment, ill-nature, and ill offices.

<P>Or &s;hall we in&s;titute <HI>a &s;upreme power, with full and ef|fectual authority to control the animo&s;ities and decide the di&s;putes of the&s;e &s;trong, contending bodies?</HI> In the one propo&s;ed to us, we have perhaps every chance of a <HI>righteous judgment,</HI> that we have any rea&s;on to hope for; but I am clearly of opinion, that even a <HI>wrongful deci&s;ion</HI> would, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, be preferable to <HI>the continuance</HI> of &s;uch de&s;tructive contro|ver&s;ies.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e that neither <HI>Brutus</HI> nor any of his friends would wi&s;h to &s;ee our government <HI>embroiled abroad,</HI> and, therefore, will admit it nece&s;&s;ary to in&s;titute &s;ome <HI>federal authority,</HI> &s;ufficient to puni&s;h <HI>any individual or State,</HI> who &s;hall violate our <HI>treaties</HI> with foreign nations, in&s;ult their <HI>dignity,</HI> or abu&s;e their <HI>citizens,</HI> and compel due reparation in all &s;uch ca&s;es.</P>
<P>I further apprehend, that <HI>Brutus</HI> is willing to have the <HI>general intere&s;t and welfare</HI> of the States well provided for and &s;upported, and, therefore, will con&s;ent that there &s;hall exi&s;t in the States an authority to <HI>do</HI> all this <HI>effectually;</HI> but he &s;eems grieved that Congre&s;s &s;hould be the <HI>judges of this general welfare</HI> of the States. If he will be kind enough to point out any <HI>other more &s;uitable and proper judges,</HI> I will con&s;ent to have them admitted.</P>
<P>Indeed, I begin to have hopes of <HI>Brutus,</HI> and think he may come right at la&s;t; for I ob&s;erve (after all his fear and

trembling about the new government) the con&s;titution he <HI>defines and adopts,</HI> is <HI>the very &s;ame</HI> as that which the <HI>Fede|ral Convention</HI> have propo&s;ed to us, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> "that the Thir|teen States &s;hould continue thirteen confederated republics, under the <HI>direction and control</HI> of a &s;upreme <HI>federal head,</HI> for certain <HI>defined national purpo&s;es</HI> only." Where we may ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="1">1. That the New Con&s;titution <HI>leaves</HI> all the Thirteen States, <HI>complete republics,</HI> as it <HI>found</HI> them, but all confede|rated under the direction and control of a <HI>federal head,</HI> for certain <HI>defined national purpo&s;es only, i. e.</HI> it leaves all the dignities, authorities, and internal police of each States in <HI>free, full,</HI> and <HI>perfect condition;</HI> unle&s;s when national pur|po&s;es make the control of them by the federal head or au|thority, nece&s;&s;ary to the <HI>general benefit.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The&s;e powers of control by the federal head or au|thority are defined in the New Con&s;titution, as minutely as may be, <HI>in their principle;</HI> and <HI>any detail</HI> of them which may become nece&s;&s;ary, is committed to the wi&s;dom of Con|gre&s;s.</P>
<P N="3">3. It extends the controlling power of the federal head to <HI>no one ca&s;e,</HI> to which the juri&s;diction or power of defini|tive deci&s;ion of any one State <HI>can be competent.</HI> And,</P>
<P N="4">4. In every &s;uch ca&s;e, the <HI>controlling power</HI> of the fede|ral head is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the <HI>&s;upport, dignity, and benefit</HI> of the <HI>national government,</HI> and the <HI>&s;afety of indivi|duals;</HI> neither of which can, by any po&s;&s;ibility, be &s;ecured without it.</P>
<P>All this falls in pretty well with <HI>Brutus'</HI>s &s;entiments; for he does not think that the New Con&s;titution in its <HI>pre|&s;ent &s;tate</HI> &s;o very bad, but fears that it will <HI>not pre&s;erve</HI> its purity of in&s;titution, but, if adopted, will immediately verge to, and terminate in, <HI>a con&s;olidation, i. e.</HI> a de&s;truc|tion of the State-governments. For argument, he &s;ugge&s;ts the <HI>avidity of power</HI> natural to rulers, and the <HI>eager gra&s;p</HI> with which they hold it when obtained, and their &s;trong <HI>propen&s;ity to abu&s;e</HI> their power, and <HI>encroach</HI> on the liberties of the people.</P>

He dwells on the <HI>va&s;t powers</HI> ve&s;ted in Congre&s;s by the New Con&s;titution, <HI>i. e. of levying taxes, rai&s;ing armies, ap|pointing federal courts, &amp;c.</HI> takes it for granted that all the&s;e powers will be <HI>abu&s;ed</HI> and carried to an <HI>oppre&s;&s;ive ex|ce&s;s;</HI> and then harangues on the dreadful ca&s;e we &s;hall be in, when our <HI>wealth</HI> is all devoured by taxes; our <HI>liberty</HI> de&s;troyed by the power of the army; and our <HI>civil rights</HI> all &s;acrificed by the unbounded power of the federal courts, &amp;c.</P>
<P>And when he has run him&s;elf out of breath with this dreary declamation, he comes to the conclu&s;ion he &s;et out with, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that the Thirteen States are <HI>too big</HI> for a repub|lican government, which requires <HI>&s;mall territory,</HI> and can|not be &s;upported in <HI>more exten&s;ive nations;</HI> that in large States <HI>liberty</HI> will &s;oon be &s;wallowed up, and lo&s;t in the <HI>magnitude of power</HI> requi&s;ite in the government, &amp;c.</P>
<P>If any conclu&s;ion at all can be drawn from this ba&s;ele&s;s a&s;&s;emblage of gloomy thoughts, I think it mu&s;t be <HI>again&s;t any union at all;</HI> again&s;t <HI>any kind of federal government.</HI> For nothing can be plainer than this, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>that the union cannot by any po&s;&s;ibility be &s;upported with &s;ucce&s;s, without adequate and effectual powers of government.</HI></P>
<P>We mu&s;t have <HI>money</HI> to &s;upport the union, and, there|fore, the <HI>power of rai&s;ing it</HI> mu&s;t be lodged <HI>&s;omewhere;</HI> we mu&s;t have <HI>a military force,</HI> and, of con&s;equence, the power of <HI>rai&s;ing and directing it</HI> mu&s;t exi&s;t; <HI>civil</HI> and <HI>criminal cau&s;es</HI> of national concern will ari&s;e, therefore, there mu&s;t be &s;omewhere a power of appointing <HI>courts</HI> to hear and deter|mine them.</P>
<P>The&s;e powers mu&s;t be ve&s;ted in Congre&s;s; for nobody pretends to wi&s;h to have them ve&s;ted in any <HI>other body</HI> of men.</P>
<P>The Thirteen States have a territory very exten&s;ive, and inhabitants very numerous, and every day rapidly increa&s;|ing; therefore, the powers of government nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport their union mu&s;t be <HI>great</HI> in proportion.

<P>The Members of Congre&s;s will be the <HI>be&s;t</HI> we can get; they will all of them derive their appointment from the States, and if the States are not <HI>wi&s;e enough</HI> to &s;end <HI>good and &s;uitable</HI> men, great <HI>blame,</HI> great <HI>&s;in</HI> will lie at their door. But I &s;uppo&s;e nobody would wi&s;h to mend this fault by taking away <HI>the election of the people,</HI> and directing the appointment of Congre&s;s to be made <HI>in any other way.</HI></P>
<P>When we have gotten the <HI>be&s;t</HI> that can be obtained, we ought to be quiet and cea&s;e complaining. It is not in the power of human wi&s;dom to do more; it is the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ate of hu|man nature to <HI>be imperfect and to err;</HI> and no doubt but Congre&s;s, with all their <HI>dignity of &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ation and character,</HI> with all their <HI>opportunities</HI> to gain <HI>wi&s;dom and information,</HI> with all their <HI>inducements to virtue and integrity,</HI> will <HI>err,</HI> and <HI>abu&s;e</HI> or <HI>mi&s;apply</HI> their powers in more or le&s;s in&s;tances.

<P>The <HI>dignity and importance</HI> of their &s;tation and character will afford all the inducements to virtue and effort, which can influence a mind <HI>capable</HI> of their force.</P>
<P>Their own <HI>per&s;onal reputation,</HI> with the eyes of all the world on them,&mdash;the <HI>approbation of their fellow-citizens,</HI> which every man in public &s;tation naturally wi&s;hes to en|joy, and the <HI>dread of cen&s;ure and &s;hame,</HI>&mdash;all contribute ve|ry forcible and &s;trong inducements to noble, upright, and worthy behaviour.</P>
<P>The <HI>particular intere&s;t</HI> which every Member of Congre&s;s has in every public order and re&s;olution, is <HI>another &s;trong motive</HI> to right action.

<P>Another mighty influence to the noble&s;t principle of ac|tion will be, <HI>the fear of God before their eyes;</HI> for while they &s;it in the place of God, to give law, ju&s;tice, and right to the States, they mu&s;t be <HI>mon&s;ters indeed,</HI> if they do not regard <HI>his law,</HI> and imitate <HI>his character.</HI></P>
<P>If all this will not produce <HI>a Congre&s;s fit to be tru&s;ted, and worthy of the public confidence,</HI> I think we may give the mat|ter up as impracticable.

<P>UPON this &s;tatement of facts and principles (for the truth and reality of which, I appeal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o every candid man) I beg leave to remark,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="420" REF="023972_0427_0FC2A403511F7FC8">
1. That the Federal Convention, in the Con&s;titution pro|po&s;ed to us, have exerted their utmo&s;t to produce <HI>a Con|gre&s;s worthy of the public confidence,</HI> who &s;hall have <HI>abilities</HI> adequate to their important duty, and &s;hall act under every po&s;&s;ible inducement to execute it <HI>faithfully.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. That this affords <HI>every chance</HI> which the nature of the thing will admit, <HI>of a wi&s;e and upright admini&s;tration.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Yet all this notwith&s;tanding, it is very po&s;&s;ible that Congre&s;s <HI>may err, may abu&s;e or mi&s;apply</HI> their powers, which no precaution of human wi&s;dom can prevent.</P>
<P N="4">4. It is <HI>vain,</HI> it is <HI>childi&s;h,</HI> it is <HI>contentious</HI> to object to a Con&s;titution thus framed and guarded, on pretence that the Commonwealth may &s;uffer by a <HI>bad admini&s;tration</HI> of it; or to <HI>withhold the nece&s;&s;ary powers</HI> of government from the &s;upreme rulers of it, le&s;t they &s;hould <HI>abu&s;e or mi&s;apply</HI> tho&s;e powers. This is an objection which will operate will equal force again&s;t <HI>every in&s;titution</HI> that can be made in this world, whether of <HI>policy, religion, commerce,</HI> or <HI>any other human concern,</HI> which can require regulations: for it is not po&s;&s;i|ble to form any in&s;titution however nece&s;&s;ary, wi&s;e, and good, who&s;e u&s;es may not be le&s;&s;ened or de&s;troyed by bad management.</P>
<P>If <HI>Brutus</HI> or any body el&s;e can point out any <HI>checks, cau|tio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s</HI> or <HI>regulations,</HI> which have been hitherto omitted, which will make Congre&s;s more <HI>wi&s;e,</HI> more <HI>capable,</HI> more <HI>diligent,</HI> or more <HI>faithful,</HI> I am willing to attend to them.</P>
<P>But to &s;et Congre&s;s at the <HI>head</HI> of the government, and object to their being ve&s;ted with <HI>full</HI> and <HI>&s;ufficient power</HI> to manage all the great departments of it, appears to me <HI>ab|&s;urd,</HI> quite <HI>wild,</HI> and <HI>chimerical:</HI> it would produce a plan which would de&s;troy it&s;elf as it went along, would be a &s;ort of counter-po&s;ition of contrary parts, and render it impo&s;&s;ible for rulers to render tho&s;e &s;ervices, and &s;ecure tho&s;e benefits, to the States, which are the only great ends of their appointment.</P>
<P>The Con&s;titution, under <HI>Brutus'</HI>s corrections, would &s;tand thus, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Congre&s;s would have power to <HI>rai&s;e money,</HI> but mu&s;t not direct the <HI>quantity,</HI> or <HI>mode of levying</HI> it; they might rai&s;e <HI>armies,</HI> but mu&s;t not judge of the <HI>number</HI> of

<P>Any body with half an eye may &s;ee what &s;ort of admi|ni&s;tration the Con&s;titution thus corrected would produce, <HI>e. g.</HI> it would require much greater trouble to leave the work <HI>undone,</HI> than would be nece&s;&s;ary to get it <HI>well done,</HI> under a Con&s;titution of &s;ufficient powers.

<P N="5">5. <HI>Brutus</HI> all along founds his objections and fears on <HI>extreme ca&s;es</HI> of abu&s;e or mi&s;application of &s;upreme powers, which may <HI>po&s;&s;ibly</HI> happen under the admini&s;tration of a <HI>wild, weak,</HI> or <HI>wicked</HI> Congre&s;s; but it is ea&s;y to ob&s;erve, that all in&s;titutions are liable to <HI>extremes,</HI> but ought not <HI>to be judged by them;</HI> they do not <HI>often</HI> appear, and perhaps <HI>never</HI> may; but if they &s;hould happen in the ca&s;es &s;uppo&s;ed (which God forbid) there is <HI>a remedy pointed out in the Con|&s;titution it&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>It is not &s;uppo&s;able that &s;uch abu&s;es could ri&s;e to any ru|inous height, before they would affect the States &s;o much, that at lea&s;t <HI>two-thirds</HI> of them would unite in pur&s;uing a remedy in the mode pre&s;cribed by the Con&s;titution, which will always be liable <HI>to amendment,</HI> whenever any mi&s;chiefs or abu&s;es appear in the government, which the Con&s;titu|tion, in its pre&s;ent &s;tate, cannot reach and correct.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Brutus</HI> thinks we can never be too much afraid of the <HI>encroaching avidity of rulers;</HI> but it is pretty plain, that however great the natural <HI>lu&s;t of power in rulers</HI> may be, the <HI>jealou&s;y of the people in giving it</HI> is about equal; the&s;e two oppo&s;ite pa&s;&s;ions will always operate in <HI>oppo&s;ite</HI> direc|tions to each other, and, like <HI>action and reaction</HI> in natural bodies, will ever tend to a <HI>good balance.</HI></P>
<P>At any rate, the Congre&s;s can never <HI>get</HI> more power than the people will <HI>give,</HI> nor <HI>hold</HI> it any longer than they
<PB N="422" REF="023972_0429_0FC2A40F4323D540">
will <HI>permit;</HI> for &s;hould they a&s;&s;ume tyrannical powers, and make encroachments on liberty without the con&s;ent of the people, they would &s;oon atone for their temerity with <HI>&s;hame</HI> and <HI>di&s;grace,</HI> and probably with their <HI>heads.</HI></P>
<P>But it is here to be noted, that all the danger does not ari&s;e from <HI>the extreme</HI> of power <HI>in the rulers;</HI> for when the balance verges to the <HI>contrary extreme,</HI> and the power of the rulers becomes too much <HI>limited and cramped,</HI> all the nerves of government are weakened, and the admini&s;tra|tion mu&s;t unavoidably <HI>&s;icken</HI> and <HI>lo&s;e that energy</HI> which is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;upport of the <HI>State,</HI> and the &s;ecurity of the <HI>people.</HI> For it is a truth worthy of great attention, that laws are not made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> much for the <HI>righte|ous</HI> as for the <HI>wicked;</HI> who never fail to &s;helter them&s;elves <HI>from puni&s;hment</HI> whenever they can, under the <HI>defects of the law, and the weakne&s;s of government.</HI></P>
<P>I now come to con&s;ider the grand propo&s;ition which <HI>Brutus</HI> &s;ets out with, concludes with, and interlards all along, and which &s;eems to be the great gi&s;t of his perform|ance, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>that a confederation of the Thirteen States into one great republic is not be&s;t for them:</HI> and goes on to prove by a variety of arguments, that <HI>a republican form of govern|ment is not compatible, and cannot be convenient to &s;o exten&s;ive a territory as the &s;aid States po&s;&s;e&s;s.</HI> He begins by taking one a&s;&s;umption for granted (for I cannot &s;ee that his argu|ments prove it at all) <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that the Con&s;titution propo&s;ed will <HI>melt down</HI> and <HI>de&s;troy</HI> the <HI>juri&s;diction</HI> of the particular States, and <HI>con&s;olidate</HI> them all into one <HI>great republic.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot &s;ee the lea&s;t rea&s;on for this &s;entiment, nor the lea&s;t <HI>tendency</HI> in the New Con&s;titution to produce <HI>this effect.</HI> For the Con&s;titution does not &s;uffer the <HI>federal powers</HI> to <HI>control</HI> in the lea&s;t, or &s;o much as to <HI>interfere in, the internal policy, juri&s;diction,</HI> or <HI>municipal rights</HI> of any particular State; except where great and manife&s;t <HI>national purpo&s;es and intere&s;ts</HI> make that control nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>It appears very evident to me, that <HI>the Con&s;titution gives an e&s;tabli&s;hment, &s;upport, and protection to the internal and &s;e|parate police</HI> of each State, under the &s;uperintendency of the federal powers, which it could not po&s;&s;ibly enjoy in an
<PB N="423" REF="023972_0430_0FC2A412EBEF0E18">
independent &s;tate. Under the confederation each State derives &s;trength, firmne&s;s, and permanency from its com|pact with the other States.

<P>There can be no doubt that each State will receive from the union great <HI>&s;upport and protection</HI> again&s;t the <HI>inva&s;ions and inroads</HI> of foreign enemies, as well as again&s;t <HI>riots and in&s;urrections</HI> of their own citizens; and, of con&s;equence, the cour&s;e of their internal admini&s;tration will be &s;ecured by this means again&s;t any <HI>interruption or embarra&s;&s;ment</HI> from either of the&s;e cau&s;es.</P>
<P>They will al&s;o derive their <HI>&s;hare of benefit</HI> from the <HI>re&s;pec|tability</HI> of the Union <HI>abroad,</HI> from the <HI>treaties</HI> and <HI>alliances</HI> which may be made with <HI>foreign nations, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Another benefit they will receive from the control of the &s;upreme power of the Union is this, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> they will be re|&s;trained from making <HI>angry, oppre&s;&s;ive, and de&s;tructive laws;</HI> from declaring <HI>ruinous wars</HI> with their neighbours; from fomenting <HI>quarrels and controver&s;ies, &amp;c.</HI> all which ever <HI>weaken</HI> a State, tend to its fatal <HI>di&s;order,</HI> and often end in its di&s;&s;olution. <HI>'Righteou&s;ne&s;s exalts</HI> and &s;trengthens <HI>a na|tion; but &s;in is a reproach</HI> and weakening of <HI>any people.'</HI></P>
<P>They will, indeed, have the privilege of oppre&s;&s;ing <HI>their own citizens</HI> by bad <HI>laws</HI> or bad <HI>admini&s;tration;</HI> but the mo|ment the mi&s;chief extends <HI>beyond their own State,</HI> and be|gins to affect the citizens of <HI>other States, &s;trangers,</HI> or the <HI>national welfare,</HI>&mdash;the &s;alutary <HI>control</HI> of the &s;upreme power will <HI>check the evil,</HI> and re&s;tore <HI>&s;trength and &s;ecurity,</HI> as well as <HI>hone&s;ty and right,</HI> to the offending State.</P>
<P>It appears then very plain, that the natural effect and tendency of the <HI>&s;upreme powers</HI> of the Union is, to give <HI>&s;trength, e&s;tabli&s;hment, and permanency</HI> to the internal police and juri&s;diction of <HI>each of the particular States;</HI> not to <HI>melt down and de&s;troy,</HI> but to <HI>&s;upport and confirm,</HI> them all.</P>
<P>By what &s;ort of a&s;&s;urance, then, can <HI>Brutus</HI> tell us, that the New Con&s;titution, <HI>if executed, mu&s;t certainly and infa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ibly terminate in a con&s;olidation of the whole into one great

It is true, that the Con&s;titution, <HI>like every other on earth</HI> committed to human management, <HI>may be corrupted by a bad admini&s;tra|tion,</HI> and be made to operate to the <HI>de&s;truction</HI> of the very capital benefits and u&s;es, which were the <HI>great end</HI> of its in&s;titution.</P>
<P>The &s;ame argument will prove, with equal cogency, that the Con&s;titution of each particular State may be corrupted in practice, become tyrannical and inimical to liberty.

<P>But, after all, &s;uppo&s;ing this event &s;hould take place, and, by &s;ome &s;trange fatality, the &s;everal States &s;hould be <HI>melted down</HI> and <HI>merged</HI> in the great Commonwealth, in the form of <HI>counties</HI> or <HI>di&s;tricts;</HI> I do not &s;ee why <HI>a common|wealth mode of government would not be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s &s;uitable and con|venient for the great State, as any other form whatever;</HI> I cannot &s;ee any &s;ufficient ground or rea&s;on for the po&s;ition pretty often and boldly advanced, <HI>that a republican form of government can never be &s;uitable for any nation of exten&s;ive territory and numerous population.</HI></P>
<P>For if Congre&s;s can be cho&s;en by the &s;everal States, tho' under the form and name of <HI>counties or election-di&s;tricts,</HI> and be in every re&s;pect in&s;tituted as directed by the New Con|&s;titution, I do not &s;ee but we &s;hall have as &s;uitable a <HI>nation|al council,</HI> as wi&s;e a <HI>legi&s;lative,</HI> and as &s;trong and &s;afe an <HI>executive, power,</HI> as can be obtained under any form of go|vernment whatever, let our territory be <HI>ever &s;o exten&s;ive or populous.</HI></P>

<HEAD>AN ESSAY ON CREDIT: IN WHICH The Doctrine of BANKS is con&s;idered, AND Some REMARKS are made on the PRESENT STATE of the BANK OF NORTH-AMERICA.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">[Fir&s;t publi&s;hed in Philadelphia, Feb. 10, 1786.]</HEAD>
<P>CREDIT <HI>is the confidence which mankind place in the virtue and good character of its object:</HI> &s;o when we &s;ay of a man, 'he is a per&s;on of credit and reputation,' the meaning is, that he is a man in who&s;e virtue and good character people in general place confidence.</P>
<P>Credit, in a commercial &s;en&s;e, <HI>is the confidence which peo|ple place in a man's integrity and punctuality in fulfilling his contracts and performing his engagements.</HI> When we &s;peak of a merchant of credit, we mean a merchant in who&s;e ability, integrity, and punctuality in fulfilling his contracts and engagements, people have confidence, <HI>i. e.</HI> a man of integrity and truth, who is fit to be believed and tru&s;ted; the contrary or rever&s;e of this is a man of no integrity in his dealings, who will quibble and &s;huffle, evade his contracts, violate his word and truth, delay his payments,

di&s;appoint his creditors, u&s;e deceit, chicanery, and fal&s;e|hood, &amp;c. <HI>i. e.</HI> is not fit <HI>to be believed or tru&s;ted.</HI></P>
<P>From this view of the matter it appears, that credit is a mo&s;t valuable thing in &s;ociety, it gives hearts-ea&s;e, it gives wealth, it is <HI>a nur&s;e of every &s;ocial virtue,</HI> it makes a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oil &s;uitable for the growth of public &s;pirit and every pub|lic virtue; the worth and value of this may, perhaps, be be&s;t illu&s;trated by comparing it or viewing it in contra&s;t with its contrary; how much better do we feel, how much richer do we grow, how much more ea&s;y, &s;afe, and &s;ati&s;|fied do we enjoy our&s;elves, when we live among citizens to whom we can give full credit, in whom we can have &s;afe confidence, and whom we can tru&s;t, than when we find our&s;elves among people to whom we can give no cre|dit, in whom we can have no confidence, and whom we cannot tru&s;t, and where every concern or contract we make with them is attended with <HI>anxiety,</HI> unea&s;ine&s;s, and fear, and commonly followed by <HI>deceit, lo&s;s,</HI> and <HI>di&s;appoint|ment?</HI> In this ca&s;e, I de&s;ire, I can need, no better argu|ment, no better proof, no better explanation of my &s;ubject, than an appeal to the <HI>in&s;tant feelings</HI> of my fellow-citi|zens.</P>
<P>But however valuable and excellent in &s;ociety, however profitable and happyfying, however &s;oothing to our warm|e&s;t wi&s;hes, <HI>credit public</HI> or <HI>private</HI> may be, <HI>it is in vain to hope for it, or even to imagine the po&s;&s;ibility of its exi&s;tence, without its proper object, which is hone&s;ty or integrity;</HI> it can no more be forced by laws, it can no more be obtruded by authority, however high and pui&s;&s;ant, than an article of faith can be forced on the under&s;tanding, without proper proof or evidence.</P>
<P><HI>Credit and hone&s;ty are in their nature correlatives, and mu&s;t and for ever will imply and &s;upport each other.</HI> Integrity will generate credit and confidence the moment it is known in any part of the world; and the moment that integrity or hone&s;ty is ob&s;erved to cea&s;e, the credit or confidence which was generated by it, in&s;tantly cea&s;es too; it dies, it can never be brought to draw another breath, after the
<PB N="429" REF="023972_0436_0FC2A425CDDF0A68">
integrity which generated it and &s;upplied all its vital mo|tions, is gone.</P>
<P>It is here to be noted, that however nece&s;&s;ary and even e&s;&s;ential <HI>integrity</HI> is to <HI>credit,</HI> yet in a commercial &s;en&s;e, <HI>i. e.</HI> as far as it relates to trade, money, or wealth, it is not the <HI>only</HI> thing nece&s;&s;ary; <HI>power or ability mu&s;t be added;</HI> for however clear and plain it is, that an hone&s;t man will never contract beyond his power of performance, yet it often happens that his power of performance may be much le&s;&s;ened between the time of <HI>contract</HI> and the time of <HI>fulfil|ment,</HI> by many incidents which may and often do take place, which at once le&s;&s;en his credit, or the confidence of his neighbours in his engagements.</P>
<P>The&s;e incidents often affect hone&s;t merchants &s;o deeply, as to occa&s;ion <HI>their failure or bankruptcy,</HI> and <HI>their</HI> failure often produces <HI>another</HI> in their creditors, that a <HI>third,</HI> and that a <HI>fourth, &amp;c.</HI> This <HI>&s;ucce&s;&s;ion</HI> of <HI>failures</HI> often origi|nates in a <HI>&s;windler</HI> or <HI>ra&s;cal,</HI> who knowingly contracts va&s;t|ly beyond his ability of performance, and, of cour&s;e, ruins not only him&s;elf, but a numerous &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of hone&s;t men.</P>
<P>This affords us one in&s;tance of the va&s;t mi&s;chief which a community may and often does &s;uffer, from <HI>one di&s;hone&s;t man</HI> re&s;iding among them; very many others might be pro|duced of like mi&s;chief, effected in a great variety of ways, and to &s;uch a degree that a <HI>national character</HI> may be deep|ly &s;tained by the <HI>iniquity and knavery of a few.</HI></P>
<P>This &s;hows that it is of mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;equence to eve|ry State, to u&s;e every po&s;&s;ible means, not only to pre&s;erve the national credit and character of their State in <HI>good pu|rity and honor,</HI> but al&s;o to introduce, as far as may be, <HI>ha|bits of integrity and honor</HI> among their <HI>citizens,</HI> and extir|pate, as far as can be done, all &s;uch villainous and &s;canda|lous practices, as naturally tend to di&s;grace the <HI>national character,</HI> and ruin the fortunes of <HI>private</HI> citizens.</P>
<P>The&s;e ob&s;ervations will appear with greater force and advantage, if we recur for a moment to what I ju&s;t now mentioned, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the great ea&s;e, &s;atisfaction, and conveni|ence of living in a State where the <HI>public finance is &s;o ma|naged,</HI>
<PB N="430" REF="023972_0437_0FC2A4272E8C6990">
that all private citizens can <HI>&s;afely rely on the ju&s;tice and punctuality of the public engagements,</HI> and where the ha|bits of hone&s;ty and integrity are &s;o general among the <HI>pri|vate</HI> citizens, that they may &s;afely tru&s;t <HI>one another,</HI> &s;o that credit and mutual confidence in each other may prevail thro' the community.</P>
<P>Thus circum&s;tanced, every man may &s;afely employ his &s;tock in any bu&s;ine&s;s of advantage, either of merchandi&s;e, mechani&s;m, or hu&s;bandry; whereas if he lived in a State, and among citizens, of contrary character, <HI>he would be afraid to let his &s;tock go out of his own keeping, le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t it &s;hould fall into hands, either public or private, which would retain it from him, &s;o that he could not recover it again, tho' the advan|tages of improvement, both to the public and him&s;elf, might be very great and inviting.</HI></P>
<P>In a State, and among citizens, &s;o happily di&s;po&s;ed, <HI>any man,</HI> with indu&s;try and economy, tho' his means were &s;mall, might <HI>live very ea&s;y and comfortable,</HI> and the <HI>man of fortune</HI> might <HI>improve</HI> his e&s;tate very &s;afely and happily, to the great advantage both of the public and him&s;elf. Stran|gers would have every encouragement to flock in to &s;uch a State, and thereby increa&s;e the population, and, of cour&s;e, the commerce, manufactures, and hu&s;bandry of it.</P>
<P>From this view of the &s;ubject it appears &s;trikingly evi|dent, that <HI>credit, both public and private,</HI> and the <HI>mutual confidence</HI> of citizens in the <HI>public ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>in each other,</HI> is of mo&s;t momentous advantage, of mo&s;t capital conveni|ence, both to the public and to the individual members of it; it contributes mo&s;t decidedly and e&s;&s;entially to the in|ternal e&s;tabli&s;hment, &s;ecurity, and &s;afety of the govern|ment, and to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;e, wealth, and happine&s;s of private citizens; therefore, it follows, that <HI>it is the high intere&s;t and great duty of every State to adopt and pur&s;ue every practi|cable method of &s;ecuring, enlarging, and extending to the ut|mo&s;t degree, all the advantages and ble&s;&s;ings which can re&s;ult from &s;uch public and private credit, and the mutual confidence of the &s;ubjects of the State in the public and in each other.</HI></P>
<P>The wi&s;e&s;t and riche&s;t nations of <HI>Europe,</HI> long before we were born, have &s;een this &s;ubject and its mo&s;t momentous
<PB N="431" REF="023972_0438_0FC2A42D9BD14AC8">
importance in a light &s;o &s;trong and glaring, as induced them to adopt every practicable method in their power, to &s;ecure to them&s;elves &s;uch invaluable advantages. In their <HI>practice</HI> we have an <HI>example,</HI> and in their <HI>&s;ucce&s;s</HI> we have <HI>encouragement,</HI> and very &s;trong <HI>inducement</HI> to imitate it.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e, the riche&s;t trading cities of <HI>Europe</HI> long &s;ince adopted the plan of e&s;tabli&s;hing <HI>public</HI> BANKS; this plan they formed upon the mo&s;t deliberate con&s;idera|tion; they had the greate&s;t opportunities of information, had the greate&s;t experience in the &s;ubject; they knew the <HI>importance, operation, and effects</HI> of both <HI>ca&s;h and credit,</HI> the be&s;t of any men then in the world, as their trade and wealth were then the greate&s;t of any in the world. It is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that their fir&s;t e&s;&s;ays reached the perfec|tion of the &s;ubject, but they found advantages enough in their fir&s;t trial, to induce them to continue the practice ever &s;ince.</P>
<P><HI>Genoa</HI> was the fir&s;t State in <HI>Europe</HI> which e&s;tabli&s;hed a public bank; their bank of <HI>St. George</HI> was e&s;tabli&s;hed in 1407, by a public act of that republic. The plan was &s;oon followed by <HI>Venice,</HI> who&s;e bank, which continues to this day with the greate&s;t advantage to the State, as well as to their private citizens, and has ever been in the high|e&s;t reputation and credit both at home and thro' all <HI>Europe,</HI> was e&s;tabli&s;hed by a public act of their State.</P>
<P>The city of <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> long after followed their exam|ple, and their <HI>pre&s;ent bank</HI> received a public e&s;tabli&s;hment by an act of their States-General in 1609. The cities of <HI>Rotterdam</HI> and <HI>Hamburgh</HI> adopted the &s;ame practice; and <HI>England,</HI> who is always phlegmatic and late in adopting the example of the other <HI>European</HI> States, in&s;tituted and e&s;tabli&s;hed its <HI>bank</HI> in 1694; and <HI>France,</HI> who&s;e attention in tho&s;e days was little turned to improvements in trade, came later into it; their royal <HI>bank</HI> at <HI>Paris</HI> was e&s;tabli&s;hed by public authority in 1718.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e, very many other banks of le&s;s extent and con&s;equence, both public and private, are now e&s;tabli&s;hed in the greate&s;t trading cities and <HI>banks</HI> are become the
<PB N="432" REF="023972_0439_0FC2A42ED38227E8">
great receptacles of the <HI>ca&s;h of Europe,</HI> and almo&s;t all mer|cantile receipts and payments are made thro' them.</P>
<P>The bank of <HI>Genoa,</HI> indeed, failed in 1746, after that re|public had, for a great length of time, enjoyed mo&s;t &s;ignal and capital benefits from it; but its ruin was not brought on by <HI>any defect of its principle,</HI> or <HI>mi&s;management</HI> of its di|rectors, but by the <HI>madne&s;s of the rulers</HI> of that State; they were not mad enough, indeed, to decry it as an u&s;e|le&s;s or dangerous in&s;titution, but they adopted the contrary extreme, they magnified its &s;trength and power too much, and compelled the directors to make <HI>advances</HI> to the State, beyond what their <HI>funds</HI> would bear.</P>
<P>The other <HI>banks</HI> have continued to this day, and with &s;uch incredible and mo&s;t acknowledged benefit to the &s;eve|ral States in which they are e&s;tabli&s;hed, that their <HI>credit or decline</HI> has generally been con&s;idered as a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ort of <HI>&s;ure crite|rion of the &s;trength or weakne&s;s</HI> of the State in which they are e&s;tabli&s;hed. When nations are at war, they ever have thought it a &s;ure way to bring fatal embarra&s;&s;ments on an enemy, if they can by any po&s;&s;ible means <HI>&s;hake the cre|dit of their bank;</HI> and every State has always been ready to go great lengths to <HI>&s;upport their bank,</HI> if, by any turn of affairs, it has happened to be in di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t, therefore, be very ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e that <HI>&s;uch an in&s;titution can be hurtful or even u&s;ele&s;s, that has &s;tood the te&s;t of &s;uch exten&s;ive and durable trial and practice, among &s;o many nations of the greate&s;t experience and mo&s;t accurate know|ledge of the &s;ubject;</HI> an in&s;titution thro' which not only the ca&s;h of <HI>private merchants,</HI> but of the greate&s;t and riche&s;t <HI>trading companies,</HI> and even the <HI>trea&s;ure of nations,</HI> has been &s;o long negotiated, and which, thro' &s;o great a length of time, up to this very hour, &s;upports its credit and character of va&s;t utility, by the univer&s;al &s;uffrage of nations, thro' all ranks of people, from crowns and the mo&s;t dignified a&s;&s;emblies of &s;tate&s;men, and the mo&s;t wealthy companies of merchants, down to the lowe&s;t dealer.</P>

<P>But however well the nature of <HI>banks</HI> may be under&s;tood in <HI>Europe,</HI> and however immen&s;e the advantages and pro|fits which are derived from them may be, yet the thing is new in <HI>America,</HI> and by many people thought unfavora|bly of.</P>
<P>The BANK OF NORTH-AMERICA, tho' e&s;tabli&s;hed by act of Congre&s;s (<HI>December</HI> 31, 1781) which is the highe&s;t authority of the Union, and recogni&s;ed expre&s;sly by many of the States, and implicitly by them all, is neverthele&s;s treated by many people here as a mo&s;t dangerous and inju|rious thing, utterly incompatible with the &s;afety of the State, and, of cour&s;e, they think it ought to be demoli&s;hed without ceremony, and that even the <HI>common forms</HI> of di&s;&s;o|lution are unnece&s;&s;ary, as people are not <HI>very nice</HI> in the manner, or <HI>delicate</HI> in the choice of means, of hunting down a <HI>bea&s;t of prey,</HI> or de&s;troying a <HI>common enemy.</HI></P>
<P>But as I &s;uppo&s;e my fellow-citizens will ever be willing to <HI>hear</HI> before they <HI>condemn</HI> a thing that has <HI>once &s;aved them,</HI> and very often afforded many of them a <HI>material conveni|ence,</HI> I apprehend a &s;hort di&s;&s;ertation, &s;howing the nature of a bank, will not be unacceptable.</P>
<P><HI>A</HI> BANK <HI>is a large repo&s;itory of ca&s;h, depo&s;ited under the direction of proper officers</HI> (&s;ay, a pre&s;ident and directors) <HI>for the purpo&s;e of e&s;tabli&s;hing and &s;upporting a great and exten&s;ive credit, to be made u&s;e of in every ca&s;e where an e&s;tabli&s;hed cre|dit will an&s;wer in exchange or payment as well as ca&s;h, or better than ca&s;h, as in many circum&s;tances will manife&s;tly and undoubtedly be the ca&s;e:</HI> for in&s;tance, &s;uppo&s;e this State &s;hould incorporate a <HI>bank,</HI> and order all the <HI>revenues of the State</HI> to be paid <HI>into it,</HI> and &s;hould direct that all the <HI>debts of the State</HI> &s;hould be paid in checks on the bank, or in bank-bills, payable to the bearer, which bearer &s;hould have liberty, whenever he plea&s;es, to carry his bill to the bank, and receive ca&s;h for it, and &s;hould direct further, that if &s;uch bank-bills, in any circum&s;tance, happen to &s;uit any

citizen <HI>better than ca&s;h,</HI> he &s;hould be at liberty to carry his <HI>ca&s;h</HI> to the bank, and take out <HI>bank-bills</HI> for it.</P>
<P>The effect or operation of &s;uch a bank, when its credit becomes e&s;tabli&s;hed (<HI>i. e.</HI> when the people at large believed with full confidence that the fund or &s;tock was &s;ufficient, and the management fair and upright) I &s;ay, the operation or effect of &s;uch a bank would be, that very few of the people who &s;hould be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch bank-bills, would carry them into the bank, and receive ca&s;h for them, be|cau&s;e the bills would an&s;wer by far the greate&s;t part of the purpo&s;es of ca&s;h as well as &s;pecie, <HI>i. e.</HI> they would pur|cha&s;e any kind of commodities, and pay any kind of debts, as well as ca&s;h, as we find is the ca&s;e of the bank-bills of the <HI>Bank of North-America,</HI> at this time.</P>
<P>Further, &s;uch bills would not only be as good as &s;pecie for almo&s;t every purpo&s;e where ca&s;h is u&s;ed or needed, but, on many accounts, they would be better than ca&s;h, as any &s;um of them is <HI>ea&s;ier</HI> and more certainly <HI>counted</HI> than ca&s;h; the danger of <HI>counterfeits</HI> would be le&s;s; the <HI>carriage</HI> would be ea&s;ier; they would be le&s;s expo&s;ed to <HI>thefts</HI> and <HI>robberies</HI> than ca&s;h (for a man can conceal from a thief 1000 dollars in bills, or run from a robber with them, ea&s;ier than with 1000 dollars of &s;ilver); in ca&s;e they are de&s;troyed by <HI>fire, water,</HI> or <HI>other accident,</HI> they are not <HI>lo&s;t,</HI> but on proof made at the bank, they may be replaced, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The advantage would be &s;till greater, if, in&s;tead of bank-bills, the owner would take <HI>a bank credit,</HI> and <HI>draw checks</HI> on the bank whenever he needed his money; this would enable him to pay any &s;um <HI>exactly,</HI> without the trouble of <HI>making change;</HI> he would be able in any future time <HI>to prove his payments,</HI> if he pre&s;erved his checks which he re|ceived cancelled from the bank, as every man ought to do; this would at once free him from all danger of lo&s;s by <HI>fire, robbers, mi&s;laying, dropping them on the road, &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> This practice is found by experience to be &s;o very convenient, that it is almo&s;t <HI>univer&s;ally adopted</HI> b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> people who keep their ca&s;h in our pre&s;ent bank.</P>
<P>The&s;e and many other advantages which bank-bills or bank-credit have beyond what ca&s;h can have, would doubt|le&s;s
<PB N="435" REF="023972_0442_0FC2A445A0E27118">
induce mo&s;t people <HI>to prefer bills</HI> or <HI>bank credit</HI> to <HI>ca&s;h,</HI> and, of cour&s;e, very few po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of either would demand ca&s;h at the bank; the con&s;equence of which would be, that at the end of the year much of the ca&s;h would remain in the bank, tho' the whole amount of the bank-&s;tock &s;hould have been paid out in bills, and been con&s;tantly cir|culating among the people, with every advantage that <HI>ca&s;h could have,</HI> and many other very valuable advantages that <HI>ca&s;h could not have,</HI> as has been ju&s;t now &s;hown.</P>
<P>The benefits or u&s;es of the bank, when thus e&s;tabli&s;hed, are various: 1. <HI>The bank gains all the lo&s;t paper,</HI> i. e. <HI>all &s;uch bank-bills as are lo&s;t (where the lo&s;s cannot be proved) and, of cour&s;e, can never be brought to the bank for redemp|tion or payment.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The bank can, on any public emergency, <HI>emit bank-bills beyond the amount of the ca&s;h or &s;tock in the bank,</HI> and, of cour&s;e, can have the benefit of a con&s;iderable &s;um to circulate or u&s;e for the public benefit, without paying in|tere&s;t, or <HI>having it known to an enemy that they are embar|ra&s;&s;ed or in debt.</HI> Or,</P>
<P N="3">3. If the exigencies of the State &s;hould not require this, <HI>they may accommodate their citizens with di&s;counts or loans on intere&s;t, to the great increa&s;e of the bank-&s;tock or revenue,</HI> as well as doing great favor to individuals, and increa&s;ing the trade, manufactures, and hu&s;bandry of the State; <HI>this is the be&s;t and perhaps the only proper way of &s;upporting a public loan-office in a State.</HI> And,</P>
<P N="4">4. If the revenues &s;hould increa&s;e beyond the expendi|tures of the State, <HI>they will accumulate in the bank till the amount may be very great;</HI> and a rich State, like a rich in|dividual, derives many and great advantages from wealth, and even from the reputation of wealth.</P>
<P>The&s;e advantages have been found by experience to be much greater, va&s;tly greater, than a &s;anguine &s;peculator, upon a bare view of the nature of the &s;ubject, would ima|gine. <HI>The force and energy of credit, perfectly well e&s;tabli&s;h|ed and permanent, is va&s;t almo&s;t beyond conception;</HI> it is found by experience to &s;upply the place of ca&s;h, and much better than ca&s;h, in almo&s;t all tran&s;actions, except in &s;mall ex|pen&s;es,
<PB N="436" REF="023972_0443_0FC2A4483A415480">
where &s;mall change is nece&s;&s;ary, &s;uch as travelling expen&s;es, market-money, &amp;c.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o found by experience, that any &s;um of money in the &s;tock of a bank well regulated and managed, is &s;uf|ficient to &s;upport the credit of <HI>double or treble its amount in bank-bills,</HI> whil&s;t each of tho&s;e bills is indi&s;putably as good as ca&s;h, becau&s;e <HI>the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or may at any time exchange them at the bank for &s;olid hard money, whenever, either thro' di&s;|tru&s;t of the bank, or his own conveniency, he may choo&s;e to do it;</HI> it follows then,</P>
<P N="5">5. That a good bank may increa&s;e the circulating medi|um of a State to double or treble the quantity of real ca&s;h, without increa&s;ing the real money, or <HI>incurring the lea&s;t danger of a depreciation.</HI> And,</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>A good bank will receive no money but good coin of &s;tand|ard weight and finene&s;s,</HI> and this will naturally and unavoid|ably keep the current coin, ca&s;h, or medium <HI>good,</HI> or di&s;|cover its <HI>defects;</HI> for if, by any means, a deba&s;ed or light coin, or public bills of depreciated value, &s;hould gain a currency in any State (all which have often happened) the &s;tandard of the bank will di&s;cover their defects, <HI>and an ex|change or agio of &s;uch depreciated money and that of the bank, will at once determine the true or real value of &s;uch depreciated currency.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. Another capital u&s;e and advantage of a bank is, <HI>that it makes one of the be&s;t repo&s;itories for money that is de&s;igned to lie for any great length of time on intere&s;t,</HI> as it affords a much better &s;ecurity than can be found in the hands of any private man, and the half-yearly dividends are more than equal to any profit that can be derived from them when put to intere&s;t on mortgage, and the punctuality of payment better &s;ecured, and the trouble of collection much le&s;s.</P>
<P>Such monies as are here intended, are <HI>legacies or any other provi&s;ion which is made for young children,</HI> to be paid to them with the intere&s;t, at their full age; <HI>any provi&s;ion which a man may wi&s;h to make for him&s;elf or wife, again&s;t old age;</HI> the funds of <HI>public in&s;titutions of religion or charity,</HI>
<PB N="437" REF="023972_0444_0FC2A4525CA004A8">
&s;uch as <HI>churches, ho&s;pitals, poor-hou&s;es, widows' fund, &s;ea-captains' fund, &amp;c.</HI> any accumulation of ca&s;h, which a man may choo&s;e to prepare, in order to complete <HI>&s;ome great payment, or accompli&s;h &s;ome great purcha&s;e at a future day,</HI> &s;uch as a hou&s;e, a far<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, &amp;c. &amp;c. And as bank-&s;tock of a good bank can at any time <HI>be &s;old for ca&s;h,</HI> the bank be|comes the &s;ure&s;t fund to produce the principal ca&s;h repo&s;it|ed in it, when needed, and al&s;o the intere&s;t in the mean time, which may be u&s;ed, if needed, when it is paid in, or may be added to the principal in the bank.</P>
<P>This will appear to be a very important u&s;e of a bank, if we attend to the &s;ubject a little, e&s;pecially to the ca&s;e of <HI>orphans and infants,</HI> and &s;ee in how many ways they are <HI>defrauded or &s;omehow deprived of the ca&s;h. which their parents have carefully laid up for them,</HI> whil&s;t their infancy prevents their taking care of it them&s;elves.</P>
<P N="8">8. Another great u&s;e of a good bank is, <HI>that it probably may very much promote economy and indu&s;try,</HI> as <HI>particularly in many of the fore-mentioned in&s;tances,</HI> <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> when a man is engaged in accumulating any &s;um of money for any capi|tal purpo&s;e, &s;uch as making provi&s;ion for his infant chil|dren, or him&s;elf in old age, or for a heavy purcha&s;e, or any other de&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n which lies near his heart, he will be very indu&s;trious, and his economy will be very good, till he has <HI>made up his heap,</HI> or got the <HI>nece&s;&s;ary &s;um</HI> together, and by that time he may perhaps have acquired &s;uch habits of indu&s;try and economy, that he may not &s;top at the ac|quirement of the &s;um fir&s;t propo&s;ed, but may be induced to keep on and enlarge it beyond the original de&s;ign.</P>
<P>The bank gives a &s;ure operation to &s;uch a &s;cheme, at lea&s;t in point of &s;afe keeping and punctual payment. Neighbours may &s;ee the example and its advantages, and fall into it them&s;elves, and &s;o on till the in&s;tances of &s;uch accumulations, and, of cour&s;e, of &s;uch economy and in|du&s;try, may become general among monied men thro' the State, to the great advantage and &s;trength of the State, the bank, and them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The&s;e are only <HI>a few of the benefits derived from a bank,</HI> which our &s;hort experience will enable us clearly to under|&s;tand,
<PB N="438" REF="023972_0445_0FC2A4538ABFA5E0">
and which in point of <HI>fact or reality</HI> are demon&s;trat|ed by the &s;ame experience &s;o clearly and fully, as to put the matter beyond a doubt. I do not pretend to compre|hend the great &s;ubject enough to explain all the infinite u&s;es and advantages which the long experience of the great|e&s;t cities of <HI>Europe</HI> has found re&s;ulting from banks, or the &s;till greater advantages which a further experience may di&s;|cover either to them or to us; but the&s;e are certainly &s;uffi|cient to induce every friend to the integrity, wealth, and honor, intere&s;t and genuine re&s;pectability of his country, to think favorably of the &s;ubject, and to exert all proper endeavours to participate of its u&s;es.</P>
<P>But to pur&s;ue the matter further&mdash;&s;uppo&s;e a number of <HI>private citizens</HI> form a bank, each of whom puts in one or more &s;hares, and rai&s;e in that way a bank-&s;tock of any proper &s;um (&s;ay, 1,000,000 dollars) for a fund to &s;upport a large and exten&s;ive credit, for the purpo&s;e of <HI>depo&s;its, loans,</HI> and <HI>di&s;counts,</HI> and appoint proper officers to manage the &s;ame, and obtain a public e&s;tabli&s;hment by <HI>a charter,</HI> or <HI>other public act</HI> of the government; this will be <HI>a private bank,</HI> becau&s;e the &s;tock of it is the money of private men, and the officers or directors are appointed by private &s;tock|holders; <HI>but it may in &s;ome &s;en&s;e be deemed public,</HI> both on account of its <HI>exten&s;ive utility and public importance,</HI> and the <HI>public patronage and e&s;tabli&s;hment</HI> it receives from govern|ment.</P>
<P>This bank will have a nature and operation &s;imilar to the other, and will a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ord the &s;ame kind of convenience to the citizens who choo&s;e to be concerned in it, and in both ca&s;es the particular profits of the bank will go to the &s;tock|holders, <HI>i. e.</HI> to the private &s;tockholders, who&s;e contribu|tions compo&s;e the &s;tock, or to the State, as far as the pub|lic funds are ve&s;ted in bank-&s;tock, if it &s;hould be thought proper to ve&s;t any part of the public trea&s;ure in &s;uch &s;tock, but the <HI>management</HI> of it would be exclu&s;ively under the conduct of its <HI>own &s;tockholders and directors.</HI></P>
<P>Of this kind is the BANK OF NORTH-AMERICA, and has a much greater capital (about 900,000 dollars) than any <HI>&s;tate-bank</HI> can have in the pre&s;ent condition of our
<PB N="439" REF="023972_0446_0FC2A454EF4D96B0">
finances, and its operation, effects, and u&s;es are much more exten&s;ive, and its accommodations to the citizens, and even to the State, much greater than a &s;tate-bank could have; this may afford one an&s;wer to an objection which &s;ome may rai&s;e again&s;t the pre&s;ent bank, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>
<P><HI>That it would be better to di&s;continue the pre&s;ent bank, and erect a &s;tate or public bank in its &s;tead;</HI> another an&s;wer may be, <HI>that no plan of this &s;ort can be &s;o &s;ure of a proper ma|nagement under the State, as it would be under the direction of its own proprietors.</HI> A bank is a &s;ort of mercantile in&s;ti|tution, or at lea&s;t has &s;uch a clo&s;e connexion with the whole mercantile intere&s;t, that it will more naturally and properly fall under the direction of merchants, than of any other &s;ort of men le&s;s acquainted with its nature and prin|ciples, and le&s;s intere&s;ted in its &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Another rea&s;on is, that a bank, who&s;e &s;tock is made up by the &s;ub&s;cription of private men, and managed by the &s;tockholders, is the <HI>&s;ure&s;t antidote or pre&s;ervative again&s;t ty|ranny in the government, that can be named;</HI> its owners are the <HI>rich men</HI> of the State, who will never be concerned in <HI>needle&s;s popular clamors</HI> or <HI>&s;edition</HI> again&s;t the government, but, at the &s;ame time, have both <HI>influence</HI> and <HI>inducement</HI> enough to be a <HI>check</HI> and <HI>re&s;traint</HI> on government, when it becomes <HI>oppre&s;&s;ive,</HI> and <HI>really verges towards tyranny.</HI></P>
<P>The rich have an intere&s;t in their poor fellow-citizens, and (as &s;ome men u&s;e their wives) however tyrannical they may be <HI>them&s;elves,</HI> they will not &s;uffer <HI>any body el&s;e</HI> to ty|rannize over them. Trade and banks cannot flouri&s;h in a <HI>de&s;potic government,</HI> and, of cour&s;e, where they do exi&s;t, they will keep <HI>de&s;poti&s;m,</HI> as far as po&s;&s;ible, <HI>out of the State.</HI> The &s;tockholders are too numerous, too much &s;cattered, of &s;entiments and connexions too different, to admit any danger of becoming <HI>tyrants them&s;elves.</HI> I never heard an in&s;tance of a State who&s;e government was corrupted by a <HI>private</HI> bank.</P>
<P>But a <HI>&s;tate-bank,</HI> if we could po&s;&s;ibly &s;uppo&s;e that it would be <HI>well managed,</HI> and <HI>grow rich, would tend immedi|ately and directly to tyranny in the government,</HI> becau&s;e it would give the mini&s;ter or ruler the command of a va&s;t

&s;um of money; and I never knew a <HI>rich trea&s;ury</HI> at the command of a <HI>mini&s;ter,</HI> who&s;e head was not <HI>turned by it,</HI> and the in&s;anity never fails to take <HI>a direction towards ty|ranny.</HI></P>
<P>The better way, I &s;hould think, would be <HI>to join both to|gether, &s;o as that all the &s;tate-revenues may be paid into the bank, and all public payments be made by checks on the bank,</HI> and let the State become <HI>&s;tockholders</HI> as far as they plea&s;e, and take &s;ums out of the bank to the amount of their &s;tock, whenever it is nece&s;&s;ary.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Many advantages would ari&s;e from this method:</P>
<P N="1">1. The bank is more re&s;pon&s;ible for any deficiency than any private man can be.</P>
<P N="2">2. It has <HI>the be&s;t convenience and &s;ecurity</HI> for <HI>&s;afe keeping</HI> the ca&s;h depo&s;ited in it.</P>
<P N="3">3. No mini&s;ter or other man <HI>can pay away</HI> public money otherwi&s;e than <HI>by a check on the bank,</HI> which is in &s;ome degree a <HI>matter of notoriety,</HI> and in|volves a <HI>re&s;pon&s;ibility.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. The receipts and payments would <HI>be &s;ettled up</HI> to a &s;hilling (according to the cu&s;tom of the bank) at lea&s;t <HI>once a month.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. The <HI>commi&s;&s;ion</HI> or <HI>allowance</HI> to a trea&s;urer for this &s;ervice <HI>would be &s;av|ed,</HI> as the bank would be very willing to undertake the bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>receiving</HI> all or any part of the public revenue, and <HI>paying</HI> the &s;ame out, without <HI>any commi&s;&s;ion or &s;alary, i. e.</HI> without any <HI>allowance</HI> or <HI>charge</HI> for the &s;ervice; this would be a <HI>great &s;aving,</HI> even if the commi&s;&s;ion allowed to a trea&s;urer was not more than a <HI>real compen&s;ation</HI> for the &s;ervice.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>This will an&s;wer every purpo&s;e of <HI>the State</HI> as well as a <HI>&s;tate-bank,</HI> will increa&s;e the &s;tock of the pre&s;ent bank, and, of cour&s;e, extend the power and energy of it &s;o much, that it will be able to &s;upply the nece&s;&s;ities of the State with <HI>any loans of ca&s;h,</HI> which (without the mo&s;t violent con|vul&s;ions) can ever be nece&s;&s;ary; and, at the &s;ame time, would be able to afford mo&s;t ample accommodations to pri|vate citizens or companies, to the va&s;t benefit and increa&s;e, not only of private fortunes, but of our <HI>trade, manufac|tures,</HI> and <HI>hu&s;bandry</HI> in general.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent funds of the BANK OF NORTH-AMERI|CA, or the ca&s;h which &s;upports it, is, 1&s;t. <HI>the bank-&s;tock,</HI> or the money paid in by the &s;tock-holders, which is about 900,000 dollars: and, 2d. the <HI>money depo&s;ited</HI> by men of all de&s;criptions, who may draw it out by checks on the bank whenever they plea&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="441" REF="023972_0448_0FC2A4581E163988">
The&s;e &s;ums are variable, indeed, but always very con&s;i|derable, as no per&s;on ever draws checks <HI>beyond his depo&s;it,</HI> very few ever draw <HI>quite up,</HI> and very many people have large &s;ums there, becau&s;e their <HI>ca&s;h lies in the bank</HI> not on|ly <HI>more &s;ecure,</HI> but is more <HI>convenient</HI> for payments <HI>there,</HI> than it could be in the <HI>keeping</HI> of its owner.</P>
<P>Some objections have been made to the pre&s;ent bank, which it may be proper to con&s;ider&mdash;</P>
<P>I. <HI>Such va&s;t &s;ums of money are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oarded up in the bank, that ca&s;h is become &s;carce</HI> in town and country. I an&s;wer,&mdash;This is not true in fact:</P>
<P N="1">1. Becau&s;e <HI>the bank circulates daily more ca&s;h than it has in the bank,</HI> and, of cour&s;e, makes ca&s;h plentier than it would be, if we had no bank. And,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>A very great part of the bank-&s;tock, on the &s;trength of which the bank i&s;&s;ues and &s;upports the circulation it gives out, belongs not to this State or its neighbourhood, but to people who live in di&s;tant parts,</HI> to whom it mu&s;t be remitted if the bank &s;hould be broke up.</P>
<P>II. <HI>Another objection is, that monied men find a greater ad|vantage in purcha&s;ing bank-&s;tock than in letting their money on intere&s;t to people in the country, as formerly was done, and, of cour&s;e, tho' the monied men in town may gain by the bank, yet the country-people &s;uffer by it.</HI>&mdash;This is a &s;trange &s;ort of &s;entiment to appear in form of an objection; becau&s;e the bank enhances the value, or increa&s;es the u&s;e, of ca&s;h or any other property, &s;o that the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or can be more bene|fited by it than before; therefore, the bank is hurtful.</P>
<P>The &s;ame cau&s;e (<HI>i. e.</HI> the bank) rai&s;es the price of wheat and flour, to the benefit of the <HI>country farmer,</HI> indeed, but to the damage of the <HI>merchant</HI> in town, who mu&s;t pay more for them than before; if our country produce was all con&s;umed in the State, the&s;e mi&s;chiefs and benefits would balance one another; becau&s;e what one citizen lo&s;t, another would gain; but a very con&s;iderable part of our produce is exported and paid for by foreigners; and there|fore the higher the price, the greater is the benefit to the State.</P>
<P><PB N="442" REF="023972_0449_0FC2A4626CDCCD60">
But this evil complained of <HI>does not originate in the bank,</HI> but in quite <HI>different</HI> cau&s;es; many monied men who u&s;ed to lend money on intere&s;t, have lo&s;t their money <HI>by the war, by the enemy, or by the depreciation of money, or by eva|&s;ions of payment</HI> which have been introduced &s;ince, and, of cour&s;e, have <HI>no money</HI> to lend; and all who have any, have found the danger of letting it in the old way &s;o great, that few will venture into it again; and, la&s;tly, the objec|tion is hardly true in fact; <HI>becau&s;e any man in the country who has credit enough in town to get a good indor&s;er, can have money out of the bank, as well as a merchant of the city.</HI></P>
<P>III. Another objection to the bank is, <HI>that the di&s;counts of the bank make money of &s;uch ea&s;y acquirement, that it induces merchants to</HI> over-trade <HI>their &s;tocks, and di&s;&s;ipating young fel|lows to</HI> &s;pend <HI>their money</HI> fa&s;ter <HI>than they would do, if it was harder to get it.</HI> I believe this is all true, and not only ari&s;es from, but is an actual proof of, the <HI>great convenience</HI> and <HI>public utility</HI> of the bank.</P>
<P>This is ju&s;t of the nature of all other objections again&s;t a <HI>good thing;</HI> becau&s;e it may be made an <HI>ill u&s;e</HI> of; and will prove that a <HI>good farm</HI> is wor&s;e than a <HI>bad one,</HI> be|cau&s;e it makes the farmer <HI>lazy,</HI> in as much as a little work on good land will rai&s;e his bread; <HI>good victuals and drink</HI> are wor&s;e than <HI>bad,</HI> becau&s;e <HI>gluttons</HI> and <HI>drunkards</HI> will eat and drink to <HI>exce&s;s;</HI> a <HI>loving wife</HI> is wor&s;e than a <HI>cro&s;s one,</HI> becau&s;e her hu&s;band will be apt to lie in bed <HI>too long</HI> with her; and <HI>riches</HI> are wor&s;e than <HI>poverty,</HI> becau&s;e they intro|duce <HI>luxury, &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> But I cannot be made to believe that ble&s;&s;ings ought to be driven out of the State, becau&s;e &s;ome people will make <HI>an ill u&s;e</HI> of them.</P>
<P>I &s;hall ever believe that it is ea&s;ier living in a place where a man can rai&s;e a &s;um of ready ca&s;h on any emergency, without delay or difficulty, than where &s;uch a thing can|not be obtained without great delay, trouble, or perhaps &s;elling property to great di&s;advantage for it. Such a faci|lity is an advantage which, I think, is not to be de&s;pi&s;ed or ea&s;ily parted with.</P>
<P>IV. Another objection is, <HI>that all the benefits of the bank centre in the city and near confines of it, but the country reaps
<PB N="443" REF="023972_0450_0FC2A4673A5E69D0">
no advantage from it.</HI> I an&s;wer,&mdash;&s;uppo&s;e this was true (which cannot well be admitted) as it co&s;ts the country no|thing, why do they begrudge the advantages of it to the city? I dare &s;ay the inhabitants of the city would all re|joice mo&s;t heartily to &s;ee the country in full enjoyment of every advantage and convenience of life, that could be de|rived from nature or art.</P>
<P>But it is very evident that the country derives a great advantage from the bank, for <HI>the richer the merchants are, and the greater their trade, the better market they afford for the produce of the country.</HI> This is a particular of capital con&s;equence to the country, for their hu&s;bandry is <HI>animated and &s;upported</HI> by their <HI>market;</HI> indeed, the hu&s;bandman and the merchant ever <HI>mutually &s;upport and benefit</HI> each other: and it is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible that <HI>either</HI> of them &s;hould be benefited or hurt, but the <HI>other</HI> will be affected by it.</P>
<P>V. Another objection is, <HI>that the great wealth of the bank will give it an undue influence on the government.</HI> There is no doubt but wealth creates influence; but it is that &s;ort of influence which has ever been found &s;afe to the State. Our bank is a &s;ort of mercantile in&s;titution, and the influ|ence of merchants is the &s;afe&s;t of any that can affect a go|vernment.</P>
<P>The <HI>par&s;on</HI> lives on the <HI>&s;ins</HI> of the people, the <HI>doctor</HI> on their <HI>di&s;ea&s;es,</HI> and the <HI>lawyer</HI> on their <HI>di&s;putes</HI> and <HI>quarrels</HI> (and, I &s;uppo&s;e, they all think they ought to <HI>pray</HI> for their <HI>daily bread</HI>) but the merchant lives on the <HI>wealth</HI> of the people. He never wi&s;hes for a poor cu&s;tomer or a poor country; the richer his cu&s;tomers are, the more they can purcha&s;e, and the better payments they can make to him. The mer|chant has every inducement to &s;eek and promote the <HI>wealth</HI> of the State.</P>
<P><HI>Wealth rarely begets &s;edition;</HI> that baneful production ge|nerally &s;prings from <HI>poverty, vice, and di&s;appointment.</HI> The&s;e are the characters which find an intere&s;t in fi&s;hing in trou|bled waters. We have, perhaps, no in&s;tance of a nation ruined by its merchants. I never heard of a State di&s;tre&s;&s;|ed by a <HI>private bank;</HI> but in&s;tances are plenty enough of States <HI>&s;erved and &s;aved</HI> by &s;uch a bank.</P>
<P><PB N="444" REF="023972_0451_0FC2A46892E4BB20">
On the whole, I think it ab&s;urd to bani&s;h wealth from a State, for fear it &s;hould gain <HI>too much influence</HI> in govern|ment, or <HI>generate faction</HI> in the State; but of all kinds of wealth, <HI>a bank would be the lea&s;t likely to produce the&s;e effects,</HI> becau&s;e the &s;tock-holders of the bank are made up of <HI>all parties,</HI> and are as likely to balance each other's influence <HI>there,</HI> as in <HI>any other part of the State.</HI> It would, in my opinion, be much more politic, to make a <HI>levelling act,</HI> to prevent the great wealth of <HI>individuals,</HI> who are much more likely to become dangerous to the State, than any <HI>aggregate bodies</HI> of men, however wealthy they may be.</P>
<P>VI. Another objection is, <HI>that the general benefits of a bank depend on the integrity of the directors, who may, in ma|ny ways, by a corrupt or partial management, de&s;troy the&s;e u&s;es, or make the whole &s;tock of the bank &s;ub&s;ervient to the intere&s;ts of a few favorites, and, of cour&s;e, the great body of the peo|ple mu&s;t be excluded from the advantages of it.</HI> I an&s;wer,&mdash;this is an objection that may be made with equal force again&s;t every in&s;titution on earth; none of which are &s;o good and beneficial, but their u&s;es may be le&s;&s;ened or de|&s;troyed by corrupt management; and when our directors are called upon to vindicate them&s;elves again&s;t any &s;uch charge, it will be time enough to think of an an&s;wer: in the mean time, the pre&s;ent internal &s;trength and good con|dition of our bank demon&s;trate, that the management of the directors has been conducted with great prudence.</P>
<P>I here beg leave to &s;ubjoin <HI>a &s;hort hi&s;tory of the Bank of North-America, with an account of &s;ome great difficulties it hath had to &s;truggle with from its fir&s;t commencement (four years ago) down to this time,</HI> and to make <HI>&s;ome remarks on its pre&s;ent &s;tate.</HI></P>
<P>I. I &s;hall attempt to give a &s;hort hi&s;tory of our bank.&mdash;It being ob&s;erved that the <HI>finances</HI> of the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t regulated States of <HI>Europe,</HI> have for a long time been <HI>nego|tiated thro' their banks,</HI> or at lea&s;t been &s;o <HI>clo&s;ely connected</HI> with them, as to derive the mo&s;t <HI>capital benefits</HI> and <HI>a&s;&s;i&s;t|ances</HI> from them, mr <HI>Morris,</HI> in 1781, when our finances were in a cri&s;is almo&s;t de&s;perate, I &s;ay, mr. <HI>Morris,</HI> being then <HI>Financier-General,</HI> adopted the &s;cheme of forming a

bank in <HI>America,</HI> which was propo&s;ed to and approved by Congre&s;s, to which <HI>a thou&s;and &s;hares, of 400 dollars</HI> each, were &s;oon &s;ub&s;cribed, and application was made to Con|gre&s;s for <HI>a charter of incorporation,</HI> which was granted by their <HI>public ordinance of December 31, 1781.</HI> It appears by the preamble of &s;aid ordinance, that Congre&s;s approved and adopted the &s;cheme <HI>from a conviction of the &s;upport which the</HI> finances <HI>of the United States would receive from a national bank,</HI> and that <HI>the exigencies of the United States made it indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary</HI> that &s;uch a bank &s;hould be in|corporated.</P>
<P>Tho' this act of incorporation pa&s;&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters"> Congre&s;s, <HI>Dec.</HI> 31, 1781, yet it was <HI>no new or &s;udden thought;</HI> for the Fi|nancier-General had laid the plan of a national bank be|fore them as early as <HI>May</HI> 17, Preceding, and on the 26th day of the &s;ame month Congre&s;s approved the &s;ame, and engaged to grant an act of incorporation, as &s;oon as the &s;ub&s;cription &s;hould be full; nor was <HI>the thing new to any of the States,</HI> for the &s;cheme of the bank, and the re&s;olution of Congre&s;s of <HI>May</HI> 26, were publi&s;hed in all the States, and &s;ub&s;criptions were publicly opened in them all.</P>
<P>In the re&s;olution la&s;t mentioned, Congre&s;s recommended to all the States to make all nece&s;&s;ary laws <HI>for &s;upport of the</HI> BANK, and in particular to make it felony to counterfeit the bank-notes, &s;eal of the bank, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>All the States <HI>recogni&s;ed the act of Congre&s;s</HI> for incorpo|rating the bank, many of them mo&s;t <HI>explicitly,</HI> the re&s;t <HI>im|plicitly,</HI> as none of them objected to it, but all made u&s;e of the bank, and participated of the benefits of it, as far as their opportunity and convenience prompted them.</P>
<P><HI>The State of Penn&s;ylvania recogni&s;ed not only the &s;aid re|commendations, by their act of March</HI> 18, 1782, again&s;t counterfeiting bank-bills, &amp;c. but by another act of <HI>April</HI> 1, 1782, counting upon the act of Congre&s;s incorporating the bank, did grant an act of incorporation to the bank, &s;imilar to, and in the &s;ame words of, that of Congre&s;s, enacting THAT THOSE WHO ARE AND THOSE WHO SHALL BECOME SUBSCRIBERS TO THE SAID BANK, BE AND FOR EVER HEREAFTER SHALL BE, A CORPO|RATION

<P>Under this &s;acred &s;anction of the law, and fully confi|ding in the honor, ju&s;tice, and even contract, of our Legi&s;|lature, the Directors, in <HI>January</HI> 1784, re&s;olving to make their in&s;titution as exten&s;ive and u&s;eful as po&s;&s;ible, opened their books <HI>for new &s;ub&s;criptions.</HI> Under the <HI>inducement and encouragement of the&s;e firm e&s;tabli&s;hments,</HI> very many per&s;ons, both citizens and foreigners, became &s;ub&s;cribers, <HI>and placed their money in our bank;</HI> the amount of the new &s;ub&s;criptions, after the charter of this State was obtained, was above 500,000 dollars.

<P>The amount of the old and new &s;ub&s;criptions aro&s;e up to the va&s;t &s;um of 900,000 dollars, which is the pre&s;ent amount of the &s;tock of the bank, a va&s;t &s;um indeed for the new beginnings of <HI>America,</HI> tho' &s;mall when compared with the immen&s;e &s;tock of &s;ome <HI>European</HI> banks.&mdash;With the depo&s;its and this great capital &s;tock (which was perma|nent, and not liable to be withdrawn by the proprietors, as the depo&s;ited monies were) with the depo&s;its and the permanent &s;tock, I &s;ay, the bank was in condition with great &s;afety <HI>to make &s;uch exten&s;ive negotiations, as could afford very capital accommodations both to the public and to private ci|tizens,</HI> whenever their occa&s;ions and exigencies made the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the bank nece&s;&s;ary to them.</P>

So great was its &s;ucce&s;s, and &s;o amazing were its effects, that it appears by the bank-books, that its ca&s;h-account in one year, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> from <HI>January</HI> 1, 1784, to <HI>January</HI> 1, 1785 (the third year of its operation) amounted to the almo&s;t incredible &s;um of 59,570,000 Mexican dollars; and tho' the attacks upon the bank, and many other difficulties which much dimini&s;hed its negotiations in the &s;ucceeding year, were &s;o great as &s;eemed <HI>almo&s;t fatal,</HI> yet &s;uch was its <HI>great internal &s;trength,</HI> and the <HI>energy</HI> of its <HI>very nature,</HI> that its tran&s;actions from <HI>January</HI> 1, 1785, to <HI>January</HI> 1, 1786, amounted to about 37,000,000 dollars.</P>
<P>II. <HI>I now proceed to give &s;ome account of the difficulties which the bank has had to &s;truggle with, from its fir&s;t begin|ning down to this time.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The fir&s;t difficulties aro&s;e from the novelty of the thing.</HI> The Directors were engaged in a bu&s;ine&s;s in which they had no experience (nothing of the kind having ever before been practi&s;ed in <HI>America</HI>) and tho' they acted with the greate&s;t con&s;ideration, care, and caution po&s;&s;ible, yet all this notwith&s;tanding, it is hardly &s;uppo&s;able but <HI>&s;ome errors in management mu&s;t have been committed.</HI> The&s;e (if any have happened) by experience will be di&s;covered, and by pru|dence may be corrected and avoided in future time, but they form no conclu&s;ion again&s;t the <HI>principles</HI> of the bank or its <HI>natural</HI> utility.</P>
<P><HI>The &s;ame novelty of the thing prevented a general confidence in the bank at fir&s;t among the people.</HI></P>
<P>It was further unlucky, that the bank was fir&s;t opened <HI>at a time when the people had &s;o often been di&s;appointed and deceived in every &s;pecies of public propo&s;itions and engagements relative to money, that they knew not whom they could tru&s;t;</HI> they he&s;itated le&s;t they &s;hould be taken in by the bank, as they had often been by very numerous propo&s;als to which their confidence had been courted. But the <HI>fidelity</HI> of the Directors, and the <HI>perfect punctuality of all payments</HI> at the bank, &s;oon got the better of this diffidence, and the bank gained an almo&s;t univer&s;al <HI>credit</HI> and <HI>confidence</HI> among the people, even among its profe&s;&s;ed and bittere&s;t enemies.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="448" REF="023972_0455_0FC2A47B00AFA8C0">
2. Another difficulty with the bank has ever been, that <HI>the balance of foreign trade has been again&s;t America, ever &s;ince the bank was fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed.</HI> This has occa&s;ioned &s;uch great exportations of ca&s;h as render it &s;carce, and, of cour&s;e, embarra&s;&s;es all ca&s;h bu&s;ine&s;s. This mu&s;t deeply affect the bank, as it is obvious at fir&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ight to every one.</P>
<P N="3">3. Another &s;ort of difficulties aro&s;e <HI>from numerous ene|mies, who, from different motives, embarra&s;&s;ed the operation of the bank much;</HI> they began with crying up the <HI>public uti|lity</HI> of the in&s;titution, and its great profits to the &s;tock|holders, and thought that one &s;et of men ought not to monopolize the reputation and opportunity of doing &s;o much good, and engro&s;&s;ing &s;uch great profits to them&s;elves, and withal threw out hints, importing that the Directors were <HI>haughty, partial, and not obliging enough, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>To remedy all which, in 1784 they &s;et on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oot <HI>a &s;cheme for a new bank, by the name of the Bank of Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> got large &s;ub&s;criptions for a fund to begin with, and peti|tioned the A&s;&s;embly of this State for a charter, &amp;c. not a word was heard all this time again&s;t the bank, <HI>as an in&s;ti|tution hurtful to the States or individuals,</HI> but its <HI>mi&s;chiefs</HI> were made to grow out of its <HI>great utility</HI> and <HI>&s;alutary</HI> ef|fects.</P>
<P>The Directors, with much trouble, <HI>put a &s;top to this plan,</HI> by &s;trongly urging the fatal con&s;equences ari&s;ing <HI>from two capital banks operating in one city,</HI> which might, perhaps, <HI>act in oppo&s;ition to each other,</HI> and, of cour&s;e, de&s;troy each other. They finally per&s;uaded the &s;ub&s;cribers to the new bank to relinqui&s;h their &s;cheme, and join the old bank, and add their &s;ub&s;criptions to it, which they at la&s;t agreed to, and &s;o that difficulty was got over.</P>
<P>But the bank did not re&s;t long, for &s;oon after this la&s;t mentioned difficulty &s;ub&s;ided, there aro&s;e a pretty nume|rous party in the State who adopted the <HI>&s;cheme of paper money to be i&s;&s;ued by our General A&s;&s;embly.</HI> All the difficulty was to make it pa&s;s <HI>equal to hard money,</HI> and they had little hopes of this, unle&s;s the <HI>bank</HI> would give it <HI>a currency,</HI> which every body &s;aw plain enough that the Directors
<PB N="449" REF="023972_0456_0FC2A47C20506E30">
<HI>could not do.</HI> The <HI>bank,</HI> therefore, and the <HI>&s;cheme for pa|per money,</HI> were con&s;idered as incon&s;i&s;tent with each other, and one or the other, of cour&s;e, mu&s;t fall. The party for paper money determined at once that the <HI>bank mu&s;t be &s;acrificed,</HI> and united with all its other enemies to decry it as an in&s;titution <HI>injurious to the State, and incompatible with the public &s;afety.</HI></P>
<P>They rai&s;ed (and declaimed upon) many objections to it, the mo&s;t material of which (that I heard of) I have con&s;i|dered already in the foregoing pages of this E&s;&s;ay. The matter was carried &s;o far, that an act of the Legi&s;lature of this State was obtained, and pa&s;&s;ed <HI>September</HI> 13, 1785, repealing the act of <HI>April</HI> 1, 1782, which granted the <HI>&s;tate-charter</HI> to the bank, and al&s;o the act of <HI>March</HI> 18, 1782, which made it <HI>felony to counterfeit</HI> the bank-bills, &amp;c. and thus &s;tands the matter at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>III. I now proceed <HI>to make &s;ome remarks on the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the bank.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Notwith&s;tanding all the difficulties above-mentioned, the bank is now in good condition; its internal &s;trength is not weakened; its funds are not dimini&s;hed, tho' its energy and extent of operation has been indeed &s;omewhat le&s;&s;ened, as was ob&s;erved before.</P>
<P N="2">2. The pre&s;ent funds or wealth of the bank con&s;i&s;ts in&punc; 1&s;t. <HI>the bank-&s;tock, about 900,000</HI> Mexican dollars. 2d. In the <HI>di&s;counted bills</HI> now in the bank, and payable to it. 3d. The <HI>ca&s;h depo&s;ited</HI> in the bank for &s;afe keeping, and which the owners may draw out whenever they plea&s;e. 4th. The <HI>furniture and uten&s;ils</HI> of the bank, and any <HI>&s;mall profits</HI> which may have lain over or ari&s;en &s;ince the la&s;t di|vidend.</P>
<P>The debts of the bank to be paid out of their &s;tock are, 1&s;t. All the <HI>bank-bills now in circulation.</HI> 2d. All the <HI>bank-credits</HI> or balances due to &s;uch per&s;ons as have depo&s;its in the bank. N.

3.

<P>Que&s;tion I. <HI>Whether Congre&s;s has a right to e&s;tabli&s;h a national bank, &s;o as to make it &s;uch a legal in&s;titution as the laws of the States of the Union are obliged to acknowledge or recogni&s;e?</HI></P>
<P N="1">1.

But the an&s;wer is ea&s;y; for,</P>
<P>1&s;t. A power of incorporating a <HI>national bank</HI> never did exi&s;t in any of the States. They might erect banks, or any other corporations, and call them by what <HI>name</HI> they plea&s;ed; but their <HI>authority,</HI> like that of all their other laws, mu&s;t be limited by the bounds of the State, and could not extend beyond them. Nor,</P>
<P>2d. Does this act of Congre&s;s <HI>limit the power</HI> of any of the States?&mdash;They &s;till retain and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> exerci&s;e <HI>every power,</HI> juri&s;diction, and right of incorporating banks, as fully as ever they had them: for,</P>
<P>3d. The &s;aid &s;econd article of Confederation does not re|&s;train Congre&s;s from having or exerci&s;ing any &s;overeignty, power, juri&s;diction, or right, whatever; it only re&s;trains them from exerci&s;ing it in <HI>&s;uch manner as to deprive the States of it.</HI> Notwith&s;tanding all the &s;overeignty and power of Congre&s;s, they &s;hall ever be &s;o limited, that each
<PB N="451" REF="023972_0458_0FC2A4869ADD8870">
State &s;hall retain its own &s;overeignty, power, &amp;c. even <HI>concurrent juri&s;dictions</HI> (if the&s;e can be called &s;uch) often exi&s;t together without the lea&s;t re&s;traint of each other.</P>
<P N="2">2. The act of Congre&s;s incorporating the bank, <HI>is an act of finance;</HI> they con&s;idered it mo&s;t expre&s;sly as a means, a very important <HI>means, of finance,</HI> which is a branch of power that mo&s;t undoubtedly falls within their authority or juri&s;diction. They are not <HI>expre&s;sly</HI> empowered, indeed, to appoint a <HI>Financier,</HI> give him in&s;tructions, receive his plans, or <HI>form a bank.</HI> But, as all tho&s;e were nece&s;&s;ary means of promoting the general intere&s;t, the liberties, and general welfare of the States, which are the grand and mo&s;t acknowledged objects of the Confederation, they are doubtle&s;s comprehended within its powers.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Confederation (article 9) empowers Congre&s;s to <HI>borrow money</HI> on the credit of the States, and <HI>this certainly implies a power to find or procure &s;omebody who will lend it to them;</HI> and this they effected to a great degree by incorpo|rating the bank, which &s;upplied them to a very large a|mount.&mdash;They owed the bank at one time 400,000 Mexi|can dollars, for money lent them by the bank; and all the monies lent at different times to Congre&s;s, and to the dif|ferent <HI>departments</HI> under their direction, amounted to above 2,000,000 Mexican dollars; and the&s;e loans were of &s;uch capital and e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice in that mo&s;t deranged and weak &s;tate of the public finances, that (in the opinion of tho&s;e be&s;t acquainted with the matter) the war could not have been continued without them.</P>
<P>The bank al&s;o lent at different times to this State, for its defence and other public purpo&s;es, above 130,000 dol|lars, which certainly proves that the bank was very conve|nient to the public, and very nece&s;&s;ary to the general wel|fare and general intere&s;t of it; and, therefore, mu&s;t be comprehended in the powers granted to Congre&s;s, to ma|nage the general intere&s;t, and &s;ecure the liberties, defence, and general welfare of the States.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>The independence, defence, and almo&s;t the very exi&s;tence, of our pre&s;ent political e&s;tabli&s;hments mu&s;t depend on the bank, in ca&s;e of an inva&s;ion of an enemy;</HI> for it is very certain, that,
<PB N="452" REF="023972_0459_0FC2A4880E7BCF38">
in &s;uch ca&s;e, due and nece&s;&s;ary oppo&s;ition and defence could not be made by a depreciating currency; nor do I think it would be po&s;&s;ible for the Congre&s;s or States to bor|row el&s;ewhere monies &s;ufficient, and in &s;ea&s;on, for our de|fence; or to i&s;&s;ue paper bills enough for that purpo&s;e, which would not depreciate.&mdash;I apprehend I &s;hall not be called on for any proof of this.</P>
<P>I therefore go on to infer, that Congre&s;s, who are ex|pre&s;sly empowered to &s;ecure <HI>the defence, liberties, welfare, and general intere&s;ts</HI> of the States, are, of cour&s;e, empow|ered <HI>to in&s;titute a bank,</HI> which is &s;o <HI>apparently and e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to all the&s;e great purpo&s;es.</HI>&mdash;It follows then, that tho&s;e who oppo&s;e the bank, oppo&s;e the e&s;&s;ential means of our defence, and, of cour&s;e, lay us open to de&s;truction, the fir&s;t time any enemy &s;hall invade our country.</P>
<P N="5">5. If we &s;hould admit that there was a defect in the powers of Congre&s;s to incorporate the bank, yet <HI>that defect is amply &s;upplied by the &s;ub&s;equent recogni&s;ance of the States, their acquie&s;cence in the in&s;titution, and participation of the be|nefits of it, for a cour&s;e of years; for a &s;ub&s;equent con&s;ent of the principal</HI> is as good as <HI>a previous order,</HI> to every purpo&s;e of e&s;tabli&s;hment or legitimation of any act of <HI>a &s;ub&s;ti|tute.</HI></P>
<P>On the whole, then, I conclude that the Bank of <HI>North-America,</HI> by the ordinance of Congre&s;s for its incorpora|tion, is a well-e&s;tabli&s;hed and <HI>legal</HI> in&s;titution, and as &s;uch ought to be con&s;idered and recogni&s;ed by all the States, both in their laws and all judicial proceedings, as far as the &s;ame may affect the &s;aid bank.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion II. <HI>What is the meaning, energy, and operation of the act of this State of March</HI> 18, 1782, <HI>making it felony to counterfeit the &s;eal or bills of the bank?</HI>&mdash;I an&s;wer&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. It carries in it the &s;tronge&s;t <HI>recogni&s;ance</HI> or <HI>acknow|ledgment of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> legal e&s;tabli&s;hment of the bank;</HI> and, of cour&s;e, of the authority and lawful force of the ordinance of Con|gre&s;s for its incorporation, on which alone the legality of the bank then depended; for it is trifling, it is ridiculous, it is infamous, to &s;uppo&s;e that the Legi&s;lature of this State would, by a mo&s;t &s;olemn act, make it <HI>felony, i. e.</HI> death,
<PB N="453" REF="023972_0460_0FC2A48993D4EF50">
to counterfeit the &s;eal and bills of any number of men, who had <HI>no legal right</HI> to <HI>make a &s;eal, i&s;&s;ue bills,</HI> or <HI>a&s;&s;ume</HI> to them&s;elves any other <HI>powers,</HI> liberties, or privileges of <HI>a corporate body.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That act implies the mo&s;t &s;olemn con&s;ent of this State to the afore&s;aid ordinance of Congre&s;s, and carries in it further the nature and energy of a &s;olemn &s;tipulation and compact</HI> of this State with Congre&s;s, <HI>i. e.</HI> with all the States, to &s;up|port that public mea&s;ure of the Union, with all the weight and authority which this State could give to it, in all the particulars or clau&s;es mentioned or enacted in the &s;aid law.</P>
<P>The <HI>public and vigorous &s;upport</HI> of the particular States gives <HI>great force</HI> to an act of Congre&s;s, tho' it might be con&s;idered as <HI>fully legal</HI> without it, gives confidence in the public mea&s;ures, and is a good rea&s;on and &s;trong induce|ment to engage the public councils of the particular States, as well as individuals, &s;trongly to exert them&s;elves and ri&s;k their fortunes therein. Therefore,</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>That act cannot, of right, be repealed by this State, without con&s;ent of Congre&s;s, i. e. of the other States of the Union.</HI> It is a part of <HI>that &s;upport</HI> of a public mea&s;ure of the Union, on which the <HI>other States</HI> have, and ought to have, <HI>dependence and confidence. Mutual confidence is the end of the Union,</HI> as that alone can produce defence and other exertions for the public welfare; all the States have therefore an intere&s;t in <HI>that &s;upport,</HI> a very great intere&s;t, indeed, and cannot be deprived of it, without a violation of the union; it is a part of that band of union, which holds the States together; to take it away, therefore, is to weaken the union, and, of cour&s;e, to le&s;&s;en its power of operation, and the benefits re&s;ulting from it.</P>
<P>Indeed, if this State can <HI>repeal</HI> the &s;aid act <HI>without con|&s;ent of the other States,</HI> I do not &s;ee why they may not go on to <HI>repeal</HI> all the acts they have ever made <HI>in &s;upport of the union,</HI> and all the powers of it, even up to that act of theirs which con&s;ented to and adopted the <HI>Confederation</HI> it&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="454" REF="023972_0461_0FC2A48AF34BF928">
Que&s;tion III. <HI>What is the meaning, energy, and effect of the act of this State of April</HI> 1, 1782, <HI>incorporating the bank?</HI> I an&s;wer,&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. It carries in it <HI>the mo&s;t public and full acquie&s;cence and &s;atisfaction of our Legi&s;lature in the act of Congre&s;s for incor|porating the bank;</HI> becau&s;e it counts upon that act, without the lea&s;t cen&s;ure, but with mo&s;t apparent approbation of it.</P>
<P N="2">2. It imports their <HI>approbation,</HI> becau&s;e they &s;how a rea|dine&s;s to give it all the &s;upport which the authority of this State could give, and add to its e&s;tabli&s;hment the further &s;anction of a charter of this State, conceived in the very words of Congre&s;s.</P>
<P N="3">3. Tho', as I take it, <HI>this &s;tate-charter</HI> did not add any thing to the <HI>legality of the bank's e&s;tabli&s;hment under the char|ter of Congre&s;s,</HI> yet it &s;erved to obviate and &s;atisfy the <HI>pre|judices of many people,</HI> who had formed an opinion, that it would be &s;afer to tru&s;t their property in the bank, <HI>with</HI> a &s;tate-charter, than <HI>without</HI> one, and, on the account, <HI>withheld their &s;ub&s;criptions till the &s;tate-charter was made.</HI></P>
<P>I never heard that any body, at that time, di&s;puted or called in que&s;tion the <HI>legal authority</HI> of Congre&s;s to give a charter to the bank; but the public faith, plighted by Con|gre&s;s, relating to money, had been at that time &s;o <HI>often and recently violated,</HI> that very little confidence was placed by many people in their <HI>public acts</HI> or <HI>re&s;olutions</HI> of any &s;ort, who therefore thought them&s;elves more &s;ecure under a &s;tate-charter, than they &s;hould be under a charter of Con|gre&s;s, without &s;uch &s;upport.</P>
<P>This I take to be the true rea&s;on why the Pre&s;ident and Directors of the bank applied to our A&s;&s;embly for a &s;tate-charter, which manife&s;tly removed many <HI>prejudices</HI> and <HI>ob|&s;tacles</HI> which operated again&s;t the bank, as it was plain that &s;ub&s;criptions to it were offered fa&s;ter, and bank-&s;tock was more coveted, after the &s;tate-charter was obtained than be|fore: therefore, I think it very evident that,</P>
<P N="4">4. This act operated by way of <HI>&s;trong inducement and encouragement to very many citizens, as well as &s;trangers,</HI> to <HI>&s;ub&s;cribe to the bank, and tru&s;t their property in it;</HI> and that
<PB N="455" REF="023972_0462_0FC2A48C6EC5EC38">
the act was purpo&s;ely made with intention that it might have this operation and effect; and therefore ought to <HI>&s;e|cure the proprietors</HI> from <HI>any di&s;appointment,</HI> as far as the whole force of the act can do it; for certainly it cannot be ju&s;tifiable in any State <HI>to hold out encouragement</HI> to the peo|ple, to draw them into a <HI>&s;nare,</HI> and then leave them in the <HI>lurch.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. Whatever might be the effect of this act on the bank, by way of aiding the legality of its e&s;tabli&s;hment, or giv|ing it &s;upport as a Continental in&s;titution, there is no doubt but it had this one perfect effect, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> it incorpora|ted the &s;ub&s;cribers to the bank into a legal company, and in&s;tituted a <HI>complete, e&s;tabli&s;hed,</HI> and <HI>legal bank</HI> of <HI>Penn&s;ylva|nia,</HI> tho' by the name of the Pre&s;ident, Directors, and Company of the Bank of <HI>North-America;</HI> for any State may give <HI>what name</HI> or <HI>title</HI> they plea&s;e to their coporations, tho' they cannot extend their <HI>authority</HI> or <HI>privileges</HI> beyond their own juri&s;diction.</P>
<P>This act, therefore, undoubtedly brought the bank un|der the <HI>cogni&s;ance</HI> of the laws of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> and entitled the Company, and every proprietor of it, to the full <HI>pro|tection</HI> of the&s;e laws. Whether this put them into any <HI>bet|ter</HI> condition than they were before, made their e&s;tabli&s;h|ment any more <HI>legal,</HI> or increa&s;ed their right to the <HI>protec|tion</HI> of the laws of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> or not, may be a que&s;tion; but it can be no que&s;tion, that very many people were of this opinion, and governed their conduct by it.</P>
<P>It is further certain that this &s;tate-charter may eventually prove of mo&s;t capital &s;ervice to the &s;tockholders; for it is po&s;&s;ible that Congre&s;s may repeal their ordinance for incor|porating the bank, or, by &s;ome other act of &s;overeignty, may vacate its charter (for &s;tranger things happen &s;ome|times) or the union of the Thirteen States may, by &s;ome means or other, be di&s;&s;olved (which, I think, would &s;oon happen, if each State &s;hould <HI>withdraw its &s;upports</HI>) and, by that means, the authority of all their acts might cea&s;e, and, of cour&s;e, their charter of the bank might fall with the re&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="456" REF="023972_0463_0FC2A49AA97E4C98">
Yet, I &s;ay (all the&s;e mi&s;haps notwith&s;tanding) under the charter of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> the bank would continue to be a <HI>legal &s;tate-e&s;tabli&s;hment,</HI> and might go on with its negotia|tions, and, in &s;hort, pur&s;ue the whole bu&s;ine&s;s which the great intere&s;ts of the concern might make nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion IV. <HI>Can the act of March</HI> 18, 1782 (making it felony to counterfeit bank-bills, &amp;c.) <HI>and that of April</HI> 1, 1782 (incorporating the bank) I &s;ay, <HI>can the&s;e acts, of right, be repealed by our Legi&s;lature, without con&s;ent of the parties intere&s;ted.</HI>&mdash;I give my an&s;wer in the negative, and for this my opinion I beg the reader's candid attention to the following rea&s;ons, which appear to me to de&s;erve great con&s;ideration, even by tho&s;e who may not think them of &s;ufficient force to ju&s;tify my conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P N="1">1. The&s;e acts <HI>ve&s;t a right, privilege, and intere&s;t, i. e. a valuable property in all the &s;tockholders of the bank,</HI> and there|fore cannot, of right, be repealed by any act of the Le|gi&s;lature, <HI>without the con&s;ent of the &s;tockholders.</HI> The&s;e acts are of the nature of <HI>bargains or contracts</HI> between the <HI>Le|gi&s;lature</HI> and the <HI>&s;tockholders,</HI> in which the &s;tipulations were, that in con&s;ideration that the &s;tockholders had or &s;hould <HI>put their money</HI> into the bank, the Legi&s;lature would give &s;uch <HI>&s;upport</HI> and <HI>legal e&s;tabli&s;hment to the bank,</HI> as &s;hould enable them to make and enjoy all the advantages and profits which &s;hould re&s;ult from it, under the <HI>firm protection of the law.</HI></P>
<P>On this <HI>encouragement,</HI> the &s;tockholders held or placed their fortunes in the bank, and the Legi&s;lature pa&s;&s;ed the &s;aid acts in &s;upport of it, and &s;o the <HI>bargain was fini&s;hed.</HI> I take it that when the act of the Legi&s;lature ve&s;ts in or grants to any individual or company of men, on valuable con&s;ideration (<HI>i. e.</HI> for which the grantee pays his money) <HI>any valuable right, intere&s;t,</HI> or <HI>property,</HI> the <HI>grantees in&s;tantly become legally &s;eized of &s;uch right, which thereby becomes as much guarantied or warranted to them by the law of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">d,</HI> as is any <HI>other property</HI> whatever which they <HI>may</HI> or <HI>can po&s;&s;e&s;s;</HI> and, therefore, they cannot be deve&s;ted or depr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">d of it by any act of the Legi&s;lature, any more than of their <HI>lands, cattle, furniture,</HI> or any <HI>other e&s;tate,</HI> of which they
<PB N="457" REF="023972_0464_0FC2A49BE1819B30">
are lawful owners, and which they hold under the full <HI>pro|tection</HI> of the law.</P>
<P>The &s;ort of acts of the Legi&s;lature which I here mean (that ve&s;t a <HI>right</HI> or <HI>intere&s;t</HI> in any <HI>individual</HI> or <HI>company</HI> of men) are &s;uch as the&s;e, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> an act granting <HI>a commi&s;&s;ion of &s;ewers to owners of meadows,</HI> who expend much money in banking and ditching them, to make them u&s;eful to the public and their owners; an act granting <HI>toll to per&s;ons who &s;hall build a bridge,</HI> for which they contribute their money; an act granting <HI>wild lands to people who will cultivate and improve them,</HI> and who expend their money for that pur|po&s;e; any acts for <HI>&s;upporting and incorporating the &s;ub&s;cribers of a bank,</HI> in con&s;ideration of <HI>large &s;ums of money</HI> &s;ub&s;cri|bed or contributed to it, and in pro&s;pects of great benefits re&s;ulting from it, both to the public and to the &s;tockhold|ers; an act for incorporating <HI>churches, univer&s;ities, ho&s;pitals, &s;chools, &amp;c.</HI> in con&s;ideration <HI>of money paid or to be paid</HI> by the contributors, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>I conceive that all acts of this kind ve&s;t <HI>&s;uch rights, pri|vileges, or intere&s;ts in the grantees</HI> (who thereby gain &s;uch <HI>protection</HI> of the laws in the enjoyment of them) that they <HI>cannot be rightfully deve&s;ted or deprived by any act of repeal of the charters or acts which give their title, or by any other act of the Legi&s;lature whatever.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The &s;econd great rea&s;on of this is, that <HI>the declaration of rights</HI> (which is part of the Con&s;titution of this State) <HI>gives every citizen a right to be protected in the enjoyment of his property.</HI> It knows but two ways by which the &s;ubject can be deve&s;ted of his lawful property; 1&s;t. by <HI>crime and for|feiture;</HI> and, 2d. <HI>by his own contract or con&s;ent:</HI> if his pro|perty is challenged or demanded of him in either of the&s;e ways, or by any other way, let the controver&s;y be of what nature &s;oever, re&s;pecting property, he is entitled <HI>to a fair trial by jury.</HI> [See articles 8, 9, and 11.] This can be had no where but in a <HI>judicial court.</HI></P>
<P>The General A&s;&s;embly are <HI>not &s;uch a court;</HI> they have the <HI>legi&s;lative,</HI> but not the <HI>executive</HI> or <HI>judicial,</HI> power of the State; they can neither <HI>empannel a jury,</HI> nor make a judicial deci&s;ion <HI>without one,</HI> much le&s;s can they deprive
<PB N="458" REF="023972_0465_0FC2A49CF224D678">
any individual or company of &s;ubjects of any of their legal rights, intere&s;ts, property, or privileges, <HI>without any trial, &s;ummons,</HI> or <HI>examination</HI> at all, by any <HI>act</HI> or <HI>repeal of acts</HI> whatever, which they can make.</P>
<P N="3">3. I take it, <HI>that the declaration of rights is of &s;uperior authority to any act which the General A&s;&s;embly can make, and will control and even render totally null and void any act of the A&s;&s;embly which infringes it; and will</HI> and ought to be con|&s;idered &s;o <HI>by the judges of our courts, whenever the &s;ame may be pleaded before them:</HI> for when two <HI>contradictory laws</HI> are pleaded before a court, it is impo&s;&s;ible but the <HI>one</HI> or the <HI>other</HI> mu&s;t be judged <HI>void;</HI> and if <HI>one</HI> of the&s;e laws ap|pears to be grounded on a <HI>&s;uperior</HI> authority to that of the <HI>other,</HI> there can be no doubt but the <HI>&s;uperior</HI> authority mu&s;t control the <HI>le&s;&s;er.</HI></P>
<P>I con&s;ider the A&s;&s;embly as <HI>the mere creatures</HI> of their con&s;tituents, and acting merely by <HI>a &s;ub&s;tituted power;</HI> and the declaration of rights I con&s;ider as <HI>the capital in&s;tructions</HI> which they receive from their <HI>con&s;tituents,</HI> by which they are <HI>bound to regulate their conduct, and by which their power and authority are altogether limited.</HI> This doctrine ought to be brought into full view, and to be recogni&s;ed by every &s;ubject, in its whole importance and energy, whenever we &s;ee our A&s;&s;embly <HI>infringing the declaration of rights,</HI> in &s;o capital and alarming an in&s;tance, as to make any act what|ever, which will, <HI>in its operation, unavoidably and eventually deprive any &s;ubject, or number of &s;ubjects, of any right, in|tere&s;t, or property, without trial by jury.</HI></P>
<P>The very per&s;ons who&s;e <HI>wi&s;hes</HI> or <HI>prejudices</HI> may be gra|tified by &s;uch acts of the Legi&s;lature, ought to <HI>tremble</HI> at their con&s;equences, for the <HI>two-edged</HI> &s;word, which has <HI>one edge</HI> turned again&s;t our enemy, has <HI>another</HI> which may be turned again&s;t <HI>our&s;elves, i. e.</HI> it can cut both &s;ides alike, and is equally qualified to wound <HI>both parties,</HI> whenever it may be applied to them.</P>
<P><HI>Charters</HI> (or rights of individuals or companies &s;ecured by an act of the State) <HI>have ever been con&s;idered as a kind of &s;cored things,</HI> not to be vacated by a bare <HI>holding up a few hands,</HI> and <HI>&s;oiling a page of paper,</HI> without any further pre|vious
<PB N="459" REF="023972_0466_0FC2A49E7137A7B8">
or &s;ub&s;equent forms or ceremonies; but in all wi&s;e States have ever been con&s;idered as <HI>&s;ecurities</HI> of &s;uch <HI>capital con&s;equence,</HI> that any attempts to de&s;troy them have ever excited a <HI>general alarm,</HI> and have rarely happened but in times of great <HI>corruption</HI> of government and <HI>dangerous en|croachments</HI> of arbitrary power.</P>
<P>I think it, on the whole, very manife&s;t, that a Legi&s;la|ture, which, for valuable con&s;ideration paid, has by pub|lic act <HI>&s;old and granted certain valuable rights, privileges, or intere&s;ts</HI> to any individual or company of men; I &s;ay, &s;uch Legi&s;lature have <HI>no more right by repeal of their act to vacate the title and de&s;troy the e&s;tate</HI> of &s;uch grantees, and to <HI>relea&s;e them&s;elves,</HI> than any private contractor has to <HI>relea&s;e him&s;elf,</HI> and <HI>refu&s;e to execute</HI> his own contract, whenever he grows <HI>&s;ick</HI> of his bargain.</P>
<P>Indeed, I think the &s;acred force of contracts <HI>binds &s;trong|er in an act of &s;tate,</HI> than in the <HI>act of an individual,</HI> becau&s;e <HI>the whole government is injured and weakened by a violation of the public faith,</HI> but the vacillation of a <HI>private man</HI> can produce no more than <HI>private damages.</HI></P>
<P>But as <HI>public faith</HI> is an old threadbare topic of argu|ment, and is as much <HI>out of fa&s;hion</HI> as going to <HI>church</HI> or reading the <HI>bible,</HI> and has been dinned in the ears of &s;ome folks, till, like the doctrine of repentance to &s;inners, it ra|ther nau&s;eates than convicts, I will forbear pre&s;&s;ing it further at this time, as I wi&s;h not to <HI>di&s;gu&s;t</HI> but to <HI>per|&s;uade.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>The ordinance of Congre&s;s for granting the charter of the bank is a mea&s;ure of the Union,</HI> &s;olemnly recogni&s;ed by this State (in the two <HI>repealed acts</HI>) in which all the States are intere&s;ted, and is, therefore, of &s;uch <HI>high authority</HI> as controls all the States to &s;uch a degree, that any attempts of this State (by an act of repeal, or any other act) to withdraw their &s;upport, and thereby weaken and embarra&s;s &s;uch mea&s;ure of the Union, mu&s;t be void, <HI>ip&s;o facto,</HI> in it&s;elf.</P>
<P>For I take it, that every act of Congre&s;s appointing or directing any mea&s;ure of the Union, when recogni&s;ed by the States, either by their expre&s;s act of approbation, or
<PB N="460" REF="023972_0467_0FC2A4A037AF4B78">
by long acquie&s;cence and practice, is of &s;uperior authority to any act of any of the States, nor <HI>does it remain in the power of any particular State to withdraw their &s;upport from it, or to relea&s;e and di&s;charge them&s;elves</HI> from their obliga|tions to it, or to make any act which &s;hall, in its operation, <HI>le&s;&s;en the energy and effect of it.</HI> But I have touched on this before, and &s;o need not enlarge on it further in this place.</P>
<P N="5">5. The act of repeal (<HI>Sept.</HI> 13, 1785) <HI>deprives a great number of our citizens and &s;trangers of their rights, privileges, and property,</HI> to a va&s;t amount, and to the utter ruin of many families; rights, privileges, and property which were <HI>gua|rantied and &s;ecured</HI> to them <HI>for ever,</HI> by the mo&s;t <HI>&s;olemn act</HI> of our Legi&s;lature, and, of cour&s;e, by the whole <HI>force and power of the law;</HI> and all this by an act of <HI>mere &s;overeign|ty,</HI> without &s;o much as alleging again&s;t them <HI>any crime</HI> by which they have <HI>forfeited,</HI> or <HI>contract</HI> by which they have <HI>alienated,</HI> them, and without any <HI>&s;ummons,</HI> or <HI>trial,</HI> or <HI>judgment of court,</HI> or <HI>verdict of jury.</HI></P>
<P>This is &s;o directly in the very face of our <HI>declaration of rights,</HI> as manife&s;tly <HI>infringes</HI> it, and, of cour&s;e, renders <HI>the act void.</HI> This is, indeed, rather an epitome of what I &s;aid before than a new argument, but the immen&s;ity of the do&s;s or damage occa&s;ioned by the &s;aid act of repeal, may, perhaps, engage the reader's attention, and &s;et the &s;ubject in a &s;tronger light of importance, than it might ap|pear in, were the con&s;equences <HI>le&s;s fatal and ruinous</HI> both to the <HI>Union</HI> in general, to <HI>each of the States,</HI> and <HI>all the in|dividuals</HI> who are concerned in the bank.</P>
<P>But admitting that the act of <HI>Sept.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">3, 1785, for re|pealing the &s;aid acts of <HI>March</HI> 8, 1782, and of <HI>April</HI> 1, 1782, is to all intents and purpo&s;es valid in law, and, of cour&s;e, that the bank is thereby deprived of all the &s;upport and legal e&s;tabli&s;hment which it once received from the &s;aid laws, when they were in force, there ari&s;es another que&s;tion, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>
<P>Que&s;tion V. <HI>In what condition does the &s;aid act of repeal leave the bank?</HI> I an&s;wer,&mdash;</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="461" REF="023972_0468_0FC2A4A76D334DE8">
1. In point of its <HI>legality, the &s;aid act of repeal leaves the bank ju&s;t where the &s;aid repealed acts found it,</HI> when they were fir&s;t made; the repeal takes away <HI>no more</HI> than the acts them&s;elves <HI>gave,</HI> and, of cour&s;e, if the bank was a <HI>legal e&s;tabli&s;hment</HI> before the&s;e acts were made, it <HI>continues &s;o</HI> &s;till after the repeal of them: therefore,</P>
<P N="2">2. The Pre&s;ident, Directors, any Company of the Bank remain a <HI>legal corporate body,</HI> under the charter of <HI>Congre&s;s,</HI> and may do all acts as &s;uch in <HI>the &s;ame manner</HI> as before the &s;aid repealed acts of this State were made.</P>
<P>Upon the whole matter, I think it very plain that <HI>the &s;upreme authority</HI> of all States under all forms of govern|ment, whether monarchical, oligarchical, or democratical (a theocracy only excepted) <HI>is lodged in the body of the peo|ple.</HI></P>
<P>1&s;t. Becau&s;e the <HI>right to be &s;ecured by, and which are the &s;ole end of, all civil government, are ve&s;ted in them:</HI> and,</P>
<P>2d. Becau&s;e the great <HI>force or &s;trength which mu&s;t &s;upport all civil government is lodged in them,</HI> and, of cour&s;e, all <HI>pacta conventa</HI> or capital con&s;titutions e&s;tabli&s;hed by them, do <HI>bind and control all authorities whatever which act under them,</HI> and, of cour&s;e, it appears that the Legi&s;lature of this State have not an <HI>original</HI> but <HI>a derived</HI> authority, which, of cour&s;e, is not <HI>ab&s;olute</HI> but <HI>limited,</HI> it is li|mited,</P>
<P>1&s;t. By <HI>the laws of</HI> GOD:</P>
<P>2d. By the <HI>Con&s;titution of this State:</HI> and,</P>
<P>3d. By the <HI>confederation or union of the Thirteen States,</HI> and, of cour&s;e, by <HI>every legal act of Congre&s;s</HI> under that union, for the general welfare of the States: therefore, if our Legi&s;lature &s;hould make an act to repeal <HI>the ten com|mandments,</HI> or to infringe <HI>the Con&s;titution,</HI> or to de&s;troy or weaken <HI>the Union, or any legal mea&s;ures of Congre&s;s,</HI> it would, of cour&s;e, be <HI>ip&s;o facto void.</HI></P>
<P>Further, I take it that our General A&s;&s;embly are limited and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">d down to <HI>the &s;ort or kind of authority which is given to them;</HI> all acts proper for a <HI>legi&s;lative body,</HI> they are em|powered to do, <HI>&s;ubject to the afore&s;aid limitations,</HI> but they cannot a&s;&s;ume to them&s;elves or exerci&s;e the <HI>judicial</HI> or <HI>exe|cutive</HI>
<PB N="462" REF="023972_0469_0FC2A4B6A8EBA1B8">
<HI>powers of government;</HI> the&s;e powers are totally out of their commi&s;&s;ion or juri&s;diction, and they can no more intrude on, or exerci&s;e the <HI>authority of the&s;e departments,</HI> than a <HI>&s;heriff</HI> can obtrude him&s;elf on the <HI>judge's &s;eat,</HI> or a <HI>chief ju&s;tice &s;erve a writ.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore, it follows that if the Legi&s;lature &s;hould pa&s;s an act, which, by its operation, takes away the <HI>life, liber|ty, or lawful rights, privileges, or property of any &s;ubject, i. e.</HI> &s;uch as the &s;ubject holds under <HI>the protection and &s;anc|tion of the law,</HI> it mu&s;t be <HI>void;</HI> for if any thing of this &s;ort is to be done in the State, or if any controver&s;y or que&s;tion about it, is to be decided, the Con&s;titution has or|dained <HI>a different method, a quite different court or authority, in and by</HI> which it mu&s;t be done.</P>
<P>It is no objection to this, to &s;ay that much and many important things <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be left to <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> and <HI>the di&s;cretion</HI> of the A&s;&s;embly; for &s;uch <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> mu&s;t <HI>exi&s;t,</HI> before it can <HI>operate, or ju&s;tify any act grounded on it;</HI> and becau&s;e much is left to the <HI>di&s;cretion</HI> of the A&s;&s;embly, it does not follow, that they have a right <HI>to throw by all di&s;cretion,</HI> and act without any.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>There is no doubt but &s;uch a combination and concurrence of event may happen, as will make <HI>a departure</HI> not only from the <HI>ordinary cour&s;e</HI> of admini&s;tering ju&s;tice, but even from the <HI>common maxims of ju&s;tice it&s;elf, ne|ce&s;&s;ary.</HI></P>
<P>Such a <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> was found in <HI>France,</HI> when a <HI>remedy</HI> was to be provided for the <HI>flagrant mi&s;chiefs of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi &s;cheme.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>South-Sea bubble</HI> produced a like <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> in <HI>England;</HI> in order to obvi|ate the <HI>enormous and complex mi&s;chiefs of that fatal exce&s;s of &s;peculation.</HI></P>
<P>The National A&s;&s;embly in <HI>France</HI> have found a like <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> in order to reduce the <HI>enormous accumulation</HI> of the wealth of the community <HI>into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">w <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ands</HI> (<ABBR>viz.</ABBR> of their nobility and clergy) and to liberate the nation from the <HI>di&s;tre&s;s, weakne&s;s,</HI> and <HI>ruin</HI> thence ari&s;ing.</P>
<P>Perhaps every <HI>ce&s;&s;ion of territory</HI> from one nation or &s;tate to another in|volves in it &s;ome &s;uch <HI>nece&s;&s;ity.</HI></P>
<P>And we may probably meet the &s;ame <HI>nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> if our nation &s;hould &s;ee <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">it to <HI>exonerate it&s;elf</HI> from the immen&s;e <HI>burden of providing about</HI> 30,000,000 <HI>dol|lars,</HI> to pay <HI>&s;peculators</HI> who never <HI>earned a &s;hilling of it,</HI> nor ever render|ed any <HI>&s;ervices</HI> or <HI>valuable con&s;ideration</HI> whatever to the <HI>nation</HI> or any <HI>body el&s;e,</HI> for any part of it.</P>
<P>But it is to be here noted with great care, that &s;uch <HI>nece&s;&s;ity mu&s;t exi&s;t,</HI> before it can <HI>operate,</HI> or be pleaded <HI>in excu&s;e</HI> of the extraordinary mea&s;ures which it will ju&s;tify; but a pretence of &s;uch nece&s;&s;ity, when it does not <HI>real|ly exi&s;t,</HI> is not only <HI>ridiculous,</HI> but <HI>very dangerous.</HI> This is arguing on <HI>fal&s;e po&s;ition,</HI> a &s;ad example of which we have in the troubles of <HI>Charles I.</HI> of <HI>England.</HI>&mdash;The King, or rather his court, held out,</P>

<P N="2">2. That the King, holding the <HI>&s;upreme executive power,</HI> was the <HI>legal and proper judge</HI> of that <HI>nece&s;&s;ity.</HI></P>
<P>On the&s;e po&s;itions they proceeded to ju&s;tify the power at that time claimed and practi&s;ed by the King, of <HI>rai&s;ing money without act of Parlia|ment,</HI> &s;uch as <HI>&s;hip money, coal</HI> and <HI>conduit money, &amp;c. &amp;c. i. e.</HI> it was only &s;aying that <HI>the King judged</HI> the exi&s;ting <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> &s;ufficient to <HI>warrant</HI> the&s;e mea&s;ures, and the matter was all <HI>legal;</HI> that was the <HI>clin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">er</HI> that fini&s;hed the bu&s;ine&s;s.

<P N="1">1. The <HI>great</HI> and <HI>u&s;ual circulation of ca&s;h</HI> (thro' which 37,000,000 dollars were negotiated la&s;t year) would at once be <HI>&s;topped.</HI></P>
<P>All di&s;counted bills mu&s;t immediately be paid or &s;ued, which would ruin very many, I think I may &s;ay, &s;cores of &s;ub&s;tantial families; and their failures would occa&s;ion,</P>
<P N="3">3. A great <HI>lo&s;s to the bank,</HI> and, of cour&s;e, to the &s;tock|holders. And,</P>
<P N="4">4. The <HI>&s;tockholders mu&s;t lie out of their money</HI> till the bank-accounts could be &s;ettled, which would probably be &s;ome years.</P>
<P N="5">5. All the monies belonging to &s;ub&s;cribers <HI>out of the State,</HI> mu&s;t be carried <HI>out of it</HI> as fa&s;t as they could be col|lected: and,</P>

<P>I will conclude my E&s;&s;ay on this very important and in|tere&s;ting &s;ubject, with only ob&s;erving, that I have <HI>&s;tated the facts</HI> with all care and the be&s;t information, and, I be|lieve,

<HEAD>STRICTURES ON THE NET PRODUCE OF THE TAXES OF GREAT-BRITAIN, In the Year 1784, as publi&s;hed by Order of their Hou&s;e of Commons.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">[Fir&s;t publi&s;hed in Philadelphia, Aug. 4, 1785.]</HEAD>
<P>HAVING by accident met with <HI>a li&s;t or detail of the Briti&s;h taxes for</HI> 1784, and the <HI>net produce</HI> of each of them, which lays open in a pretty clear manner the <HI>&s;ources</HI> of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> revenues, and points out the <HI>ways and means</HI> by which tho&s;e immen&s;e &s;ums are rai&s;ed, which are nece&s;&s;ary for the current &s;ervices of the year, payment of the intere&s;t of their va&s;t national debt, &s;upport of their public credit, &amp;c. and as the attention of the <HI>Thirteen American States</HI> is, or ought to be, much fixed on <HI>a public revenue,</HI> and, of cour&s;e, on <HI>our trade,</HI> out of which it mu&s;t grow; I thought the practice and example of &s;o old, &s;o experienced, and &s;ucce&s;sful a people as the <HI>Britons,</HI>
<PB N="465" REF="023972_0472_0FC2A4BD300F3CE8">
might be of u&s;e to us at this time, and therefore procured the account or li&s;t of their revenues above referred to, to be publi&s;hed in the <HI>Penn&s;ylvania Packet</HI> of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 4, 1785, and added the&s;e Strictures on them.</P>
<P>Whether the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> government has expended the va&s;t, the immen&s;e &s;ums produced by their finance for the la&s;t 90 years, for purpo&s;e <HI>&s;alutary</HI> and <HI>beneficial</HI> to the nation, or not, is out of the pre&s;ent que&s;tion; but their <HI>&s;ucce&s;s in rai&s;ing the&s;e va&s;t &s;ums</HI> is certainly &s;urpri&s;ing. E&s;pecially when we con&s;ider that this has been done in &s;uch a manner, that the nation has not only, <HI>not been impoveri&s;hed thereby,</HI> but has been <HI>increa&s;ing rapidly in the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial riches,</HI> du|ring the whole time it &s;upported the immen&s;e pre&s;&s;ure of their taxes.</P>
<P>The <HI>hou&s;es</HI> of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> are now much more valua|ble than they were 90 years ago; the <HI>live &s;tock</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> their farms is greatly increa&s;ed; their <HI>lands</HI> are better cultiva|ted, and much more productive; their conveniences for <HI>tran&s;portation</HI> are greatly increa&s;ed by mending <HI>roads,</HI> open|ing <HI>canals,</HI> and clearing <HI>rivers</HI> for <HI>inland navigation:</HI> their <HI>manufactures</HI> are va&s;tly increa&s;ed, both in quantity and va|lue; the <HI>trading &s;tock</HI> of their merchants, their <HI>&s;hipping,</HI> and the <HI>exports</HI> of their manufactures, and <HI>produce</HI> of their lands, are va&s;tly increa&s;ed &s;ince the year 1694, when the Bank of <HI>England</HI> was fir&s;t in&s;tituted, and the &s;cheme of funding the public debts had its origin. By <HI>the&s;e only</HI> the wealth of the nation can be truly e&s;timated.</P>
<P>This <HI>real wealth,</HI> con&s;idered as national, has very little connexion with the public funds or &s;tocks; for &s;hould they all &s;ail, this mu&s;t continue, and out of it might always be produced <HI>funds</HI> or <HI>&s;tocks</HI> &s;ufficient for the u&s;e of the pub|lic: <HI>this kind of wealth</HI> mu&s;t then be con&s;idered as the <HI>real, &s;ub&s;tantial</HI> wealth of the nation; the great <HI>ba&s;is</HI> on which all the &s;uper&s;tructures of public credit or nominal wealth mu&s;t be built, and by which they mu&s;t be &s;upported.</P>
<P>The fact is, then, that this <HI>real wealth</HI> of <HI>Britain</HI> is much <HI>greater</HI> now than it was 90 years ago, notwith&s;tand|ing the amazing taxes which have been paid during the whole of the la&s;t 90 years, and the va&s;t debt which now
<PB N="466" REF="023972_0473_0FC2A4BF648A2FE0">
lies on the nation: indeed, this real wealth, as ob&s;erved <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> has <HI>little connexion</HI> with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">word public debt; but, on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">, is rather <HI>helped</HI> than <HI>hurt</HI> by it; for it appears very plain, that the national wealth has increa&s;ed fa&s;ter under the weight of that debt, than ever it did before the doctrine of creating and funding a national debt was thought of.</P>
<P>It appears, then, that the national <HI>debt,</HI> or the <HI>public cre|dit, may fail,</HI> without de&s;troying the real and &s;ub&s;tantial wealth of the nation; for if the public credit was to fail, as <HI>our</HI> Continental money, and <HI>their South-Sea</HI> &s;tock, once did, and every per&s;on who had any thing in the funds &s;hould lo&s;e it all, this would not de&s;troy the <HI>hou&s;es, fields, cattle, &amp;c.</HI> of the country; it would only produce a <HI>&s;hift of pro|perty</HI> from one per&s;on to another; would produce infinite inju&s;tice and ruin to individuals, indeed, and no degree of puni&s;hment would be too great for tho&s;e, thro' who&s;e mi&s;|management, fraud, and corruption, &s;uch a thing &s;hould happen; but it would by no means bring on the <HI>de&s;truc|tion of the nation.</HI></P>
<P>All that could happen would be, that tho&s;e who had mo|nies in the &s;tocks would <HI>lo&s;e</HI> them; and tho&s;e who were taxed to &s;upport the &s;tocks, would be <HI>liberated</HI> from the burden of tax; but the <HI>fields</HI> would produce the &s;ame quantity of <HI>wheat,</HI> and the <HI>meadows</HI> would fatten the <HI>&s;ame number</HI> of cattle, as before; and, of cour&s;e, the bread and the meat would be as plenty as ever, and the more bread and meat the country produced, the richer it certainly would be.</P>
<P>Therefore, a man who buys lands and puts them into high cultivation, or erects mills, &s;hops, &amp;c. for manufac|tories and conveniencies of life, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es <HI>mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial wealth of high independence;</HI> whil&s;t the man who deals in public <HI>&s;ecurities</HI> and <HI>paper credit,</HI> depends on the humor, the honor, the wi&s;dom, and the ju&s;tice of the nation, and therefore acquires a wealth <HI>'which is liable to moth and ru&s;t, and which thieves can &s;teal.'</HI></P>
<P>The long experience of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> affords a mo&s;t ir|refragable proof of fact, that both tho&s;e kinds of wealth are mutual &s;upports of each other, <HI>i. e.</HI> that public credit
<PB N="467" REF="023972_0474_0FC2A4C32DA31330">
increa&s;es the <HI>value</HI> and <HI>produce</HI> of the lands and manufac|tures, whil&s;t, at the &s;ame time, the lands and manufac|tures produce the <HI>great &s;taple</HI> and exten&s;ive commerce, which enable the nation, <HI>by a proper management,</HI> to &s;up|port the public credit; and, therefore, what <HI>this proper ma|nagement is, becomes a matter of much importance for us to know, and carefully attend to.</HI></P>
<P>For <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> in one great thing, are alike, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the &s;ource of wealth in both countries is the &s;ame; the lands and manufactures are the <HI>fir&s;t matter</HI> which af|fords the great &s;taples of <HI>commerce,</HI> as well as the mo&s;t ca|pital <HI>home-&s;upplies</HI> of the people; therefore, it is probable, that the &s;ame management or line of conduct which has proved advantageous to <HI>them,</HI> may be &s;o to <HI>us.</HI></P>
<P>We &s;ee in the account of the taxes of <HI>Britain,</HI> a &s;peci|men and a good deal of the detail of this important ma|nagement,&mdash;on which I beg leave to remark&mdash;</P>
<P>I. <HI>They are very careful to make their revenues in &s;uch form that their produce &s;hall be certain, and their amount capable of pretty exact computation.</HI></P>
<P>II. To be guarded again&s;t all po&s;&s;ible delay or di&s;appoint|ment, <HI>they circulate their revenues mo&s;tly thro' the bank, or at lea&s;t keep the exchequer &s;o clo&s;ely connected with the bank, that they can at all times avail them&s;elves of a bank-credit when they need it:</HI> &s;o that they are always able to &s;atisfy the de|mands of every creditor of the public funds, without the lea&s;t delay or trouble: this could not, perhaps, by any po&s;|&s;ibility, be done in any other method than by the help of the <HI>bank,</HI> and the importance of it will be obvious to any body, who con&s;iders that <HI>public credit</HI> can by no po&s;&s;ibility be &s;upported in any other way than by <HI>mo&s;t punctual pay|ments</HI> to the public creditors: the experience of all nations, but e&s;pecially our own, has taught us that public <HI>promi&s;es</HI> and <HI>paper,</HI> or public <HI>laws of regulation</HI> and <HI>tender,</HI> can <HI>do nothing</HI> towards the &s;upport of public credit, without <HI>punc|tual payment</HI> of the public creditors.</P>
<P>III. They have ever made it an object of great care, <HI>to lay and collect the public taxes in &s;uch a manner as &s;hould be the mo&s;t ea&s;y, the mo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible, and the mo&s;t advantageous of

<P N="1">1. That <HI>the great burden of their taxes con&s;i&s;ts in the cu|&s;toms, exci&s;e, and &s;tamps;</HI> the net produce of the&s;e is above 9,000,000<HI>l.</HI> &s;terling, in all which, lands, labor, and farmer's &s;tock are not called on, nor is any per&s;on compelled to pay any of the taxes, unle&s;s he choo&s;es to be concerned in the articles taxed.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The tax is laid in a very great mea&s;ure on either articles of mere luxury, or &s;uch fine and rich goods as are con&s;umed mo&s;tly by people of wealth, e. g.</HI> about one half of this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> is on <HI>drinkable liquors</HI> (for under this cla&s;s I &s;hall doubtle&s;s be allowed to rank malt, hops, tea, &amp;c. &amp;c. the &s;ole u&s;e of which is to make &s;uch liquors) the&s;e are mo&s;tly articles of luxury, as wines, &s;pirits, &s;trong beer, &amp;c. <HI>Tobacco</HI> and &s;nuff are great articles, as al&s;o are <HI>Ea&s;t-India goods, carri|ages, &amp;c.</HI> mo&s;t of which are either articles of <HI>mere luxury,</HI> or the con&s;umption of very <HI>wealthy people.</HI> But,</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Goods of nece&s;&s;ary con&s;umption are not wholly omitted,</HI> as we &s;ee in the articles of <HI>hides, tallow, candles, &s;alt, cools, paper, &amp;c.</HI> but in the&s;e the heavie&s;t part of the burden falls on the <HI>rich,</HI> as they con&s;ume the&s;e articles with much greater prodigality and profu&s;ene&s;s than the poor.</P>
<P N="4">4. Very poor people have very &s;mall u&s;e for any papers which pay a &s;tamp-duty, and, of cour&s;e, tho&s;e duties are almo&s;t wholly paid by people of at lea&s;t good &s;ub&s;tance, if not great wealth.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>The heavie&s;t and mo&s;t painful part of &s;aid taxes is that on hou&s;es and windows,</HI> ranked under the head of incidents; this is &s;aid to be paid by the poor tenants, many of whom brick up their windows to avoid the tax.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>The land-tax at 4s. on the pound</HI> (not mentioned in the account) <HI>produces about</HI> 2,000,000 <HI>a year:</HI> but this, tho' called 4<HI>s.</HI> is really not more than 1<HI>s.</HI> or perhaps not 6<HI>d.</HI> becau&s;e that tax is laid on <HI>an old a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment</HI> or e&s;timate of the lands of <HI>England,</HI> which &s;ets them at le&s;s than a <HI>quarter</HI> of their pre&s;ent value, and &s;ome very improved e&s;tates are not
<PB N="469" REF="023972_0476_0FC2A4D5785A48E8">
e&s;timated at <HI>one-tenth</HI> of their pre&s;ent value, and, of cour&s;e, if a man has rents to amount of 100<HI>l.</HI> per annum, his tax may be 5<HI>l.</HI> or perhaps not 40<HI>s.</HI> This, and the tax on <HI>hou&s;es</HI> and <HI>windows,</HI> are all which bear any re&s;emblance to <HI>our taxes on polls and e&s;tates,</HI> and, in point of <HI>weight and burden, bear no proportion</HI> to ours.</P>
<P>On the mode of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> taxes, and the operation of their national debt, the following things may be noted, and de&s;erve our con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>I. Their taxes being chiefly on luxuries <HI>are a benefit and &s;aving to the nation;</HI> they le&s;&s;en the <HI>con&s;umption,</HI> and of cour&s;e re&s;train the <HI>exce&s;&s;es,</HI> of luxury, and pre&s;ent the vices, expen&s;es, and mi&s;chiefs, which would otherwi&s;e en&s;ue.</P>
<P>II. <HI>The taxes prevent the exportation of money;</HI> that part of the price of the goods taxed, which goes to pay the duty, cannot <HI>be exported,</HI> but goes into the public trea&s;ury, whence it i&s;&s;ues in half-yearly payments to the <HI>public credi|tors all over</HI> the nation.</P>
<P>III. <HI>This produces a great plenty and bri&s;k circulation of ca&s;h;</HI> for the&s;e payments are all made without the lea&s;t de|lay, and in ready ca&s;h, and the amount being very large (perhaps, about half the current ca&s;h of the nation yearly) makes a very large and bri&s;k circulation of ca&s;h, and the frequency of the payments keeps up that circulation into almo&s;t an equable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">low thro' the year.</P>
<P>IV. From this plenty and quick circulation of ca&s;h pro|duced by the taxes, <HI>each individual, or at lea&s;t the nation at large, derives a benefit which more than compen&s;ates the tax which is the purcha&s;e of it;</HI> for every one knows the odds of doing bu&s;ine&s;s in a place where <HI>ca&s;h is plenty</HI> and <HI>bri&s;kly circulating,</HI> and in a place where it is <HI>&s;carce and &s;tagnant;</HI> this will &s;oon produce a difference in the proceeds of any man's bu&s;ine&s;s, equal to his &s;hare of the tax.</P>
<P>V. <HI>This &s;hows a rea&s;on why the Briti&s;h nation increa&s;es rapidly in wealth under the pre&s;&s;ure of va&s;t taxes,</HI> and has uniformly done &s;o for 90 years pa&s;t, <HI>i.e. the benefits re|&s;ulting from the tax are more than a compen&s;ation for the in|convenience of paying it.</HI> So that it leaves a balance of pro|fit in favor of the nation or individual who pays it.</P>
<P><PB N="470" REF="023972_0477_0FC2A4D92BF8ED70">
VI. This benefit re&s;ults chiefly from the <HI>great punctuality with which the public creditors are paid</HI>&mdash;to a day&mdash;to an hour&mdash;without the lea&s;t put off or delay. This not only &s;ets the example, but gives the power, of punctual pay|ments, and &s;trongly tends to introduce the general practice of it, to the va&s;t advantage of all trade. This depends on the &s;ame principle as the old adage, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> "If you would make money fa&s;t, pay a high rent;" <HI>i. e.</HI> it is better to have a &s;tand in a place of <HI>bri&s;k bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI> tho' the <HI>rent is high,</HI> than to &s;it down in a <HI>dull</HI> place at a <HI>low</HI> rent, or even <HI>rent-free.</HI></P>
<P>VII. This punctuality of the public payments, which produces &s;o many va&s;t advantages, <HI>becomes practicable only by the clo&s;e connexion which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between the public trea&s;ury and the bank;</HI> but the&s;e advantages are not the whole of the benefits thence derived, the <HI>&s;ame thing enables the trea&s;ury</HI> to furni&s;h any &s;um of money in an in&s;tant, which any emergency may make nece&s;&s;ary; &s;o that the nation is never in danger of <HI>lo&s;ing the benefit</HI> of any important manoeuvre for <HI>want of ca&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>By this means they have often been enabled to oppo&s;e <HI>foreign enemies,</HI> cru&s;h interior <HI>rebellions,</HI> &s;upport their great <HI>trading companies</HI> at a hard pu&s;h, give aid to the <HI>bank,</HI> and ever to pre&s;erve their <HI>public credit.</HI></P>
<P>And could that di&s;cerning, &s;ucce&s;sful people have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed wi&s;dom and gravity of coun&s;el enough to make the be&s;t u&s;e of their own advantages, <HI>&s;ua &s;i bona norint,</HI> their hap|pine&s;s and glory mu&s;t have been va&s;t indeed. Had they in <HI>improvements</HI> of their hu&s;bandry and trade, in <HI>meliorating</HI> and <HI>decorating</HI> their country, &s;pent the money which they have <HI>wa&s;ted</HI> in needle&s;s <HI>&s;ub&s;idies</HI> to foreign princes, in <HI>Con|tinental</HI> and <HI>American</HI> wars, and many other fatal policies, their <HI>&s;trength,</HI> their <HI>riches,</HI> their <HI>re&s;pectability,</HI> their <HI>happi|ne&s;s</HI> would have ri&s;en &s;uperior to that of any nation on the face of the earth.</P>
<P>This is the nation from which we derive our <HI>origin,</HI> and I hope we may re&s;pect the <HI>honors of our parentage,</HI> without imitating the <HI>vices of our ance&s;tors.</HI> And what I have to wi&s;h is, that tho' we are broken off from them, we may

<P>But if this unrea&s;onable, indelicate method of inve&s;ti|gating truth would always produce it, I have &s;till a pretty cogent rea&s;on again&s;t the practice of it, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that the public would not be <HI>benefited,</HI> but <HI>greatly prejudiced by &s;uch a di&s;co|very.</HI> I think it is very evident that many &s;ins do <HI>le&s;s hurt</HI> while they <HI>lie concealed,</HI> than they would do, <HI>if publi&s;hed;</HI> caves-droppers rarely hear any good of them&s;elves; jealou&s;y is a low, unea&s;y pa&s;&s;ion, and is commonly gratified by an <HI>increa&s;e of torment;</HI> and people that are anxiou&s;ly fond of <HI>fi&s;hing</HI> for &s;ecrets, rarely fail to <HI>hook in</HI> trouble; and the&s;e ob&s;ervations are not le&s;s true, and commonly more dan|gerous, in <HI>&s;tate-policy</HI> than in <HI>private life;</HI> but in both e|qually indicate <HI>weakne&s;s of intellects,</HI> di&s;orders of imagina|tion, great ignorance of human nature, and that painful, ridiculous anxiety which generally accompanies irritable nerves, and want of true, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound judgment.</P>

when it de&s;cends to <HI>low, pimping</HI> methods of ad|mini&s;tration. The tree is to be judged by its fruit only.</P>

<P>I have on the whole no opinion that <HI>te&s;t-acts</HI> or even <HI>oaths of allegiance</HI> afford any kind of &s;ecurity to the State; nor have I any very high opinion of <HI>oaths of office,</HI> but I do greatly object to <HI>any oaths being tacked to an office,</HI> more than the &s;imple <HI>adjuration to execute the office legally and faithfully;</HI> and I equally object to municipal rights and privileges be|ing made dependent on te&s;t-oaths or &s;olemn declarations of &s;ecret opinions or &s;entiments.</P>

<P>As a rea&s;on for this, I humbly urge, over and above the capital arguments drawn from the ju&s;tice of government, and the equality and impartiality with which it ought to be admini&s;tered to all orders and ranks of people, I &s;ay, be|&s;ides this, I wi&s;h to urge the nece&s;&s;ity of convincing all our people, <HI>by the equity and impartiality of our government,</HI> that it is a <HI>&s;afe and &s;ure protection</HI> of per&s;on and property; that

<P>This will give a practical proof that our government carries in i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the mo&s;t characteri&s;tic marks of a <HI>free, ju&s;t, and gentle policy,</HI> which is directly oppo&s;ed <HI>to tyranny,</HI> the e&s;&s;ence of which con&s;i&s;ts in a <HI>denial or partial di&s;tribution of ju&s;tice,</HI> and laying <HI>unequal</HI> burdens on <HI>one part</HI> of the com|munity, in <HI>favor of other parts.</HI> This will &s;oon gain the approbation and confidence of all people of &s;erious and cool reflexion; the <HI>violent ravings</HI> of pa&s;&s;ion and prejudice will &s;oon <HI>&s;pend their own &s;trength,</HI> and &s;ub&s;ide of cour&s;e, when all <HI>real ground</HI> of complaint is taken away.</P>
<P>The non-jurors are very numerous; our bu&s;ine&s;s and in|tere&s;t is to get them reconciled, not exterminated. Man|kind will ever like that government be&s;t, where they can enjoy mo&s;t &s;ecurity, ju&s;tice, and peace. Our political cha|racter, both among neighbours and foreign nations, re|quires this; if great numbers of <HI>our own people</HI> have a &s;trong aver&s;ion to <HI>our</HI> government, it will afford a pre|&s;umption to &s;trangers, that either our people or our go|vernment mu&s;t be <HI>very bad.</HI> Either of which will le&s;&s;en our dignity and weight, and injure our public character abroad, and di&s;courage that acce&s;&s;ion of foreigners, which is nece&s;&s;ary to increa&s;e our population, trade, and hu&s;ban|dry.</P>
<P><HI>Rigor</HI> and <HI>force</HI> can never govern any people longer than till they can find an opportunity of <HI>avoiding</HI> or <HI>revenging</HI> it.

together, and mutually &s;upport each other, the go|vernment has the highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible &s;ecurity of good order, public peace, and &s;ocial happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Sundry other rea&s;ons and ob&s;ervations might be added on this &s;ubject, which I can only hint at here, and leave the reader to enlarge on them as he plea&s;es.</P>
<P>I. A great <HI>multiplicity</HI> of oaths makes them <HI>common</HI> and <HI>families,</HI> and thereby <HI>le&s;&s;ens</HI> their &s;olemnity and practical force.</P>
<P>II. It cannot be expected that they will be <HI>&s;incerely taken and kept;</HI> and, therefore, they will introduce many <HI>perju|ries, eva&s;ions, &amp;c.</HI> which naturally tend to eradicate from the mind the high obligation of &s;uch awful appeals to the ALMIGHTY, and that <HI>&s;olemn &s;en&s;e of truth,</HI> which mo&s;t effectually &s;ecures the benefits of an oath.</P>
<P>III. It is pre&s;umed that very few of the pre&s;ent non-jurors refu&s;e the oaths becau&s;e they wi&s;h to return to the <HI>Engli&s;h government,</HI> or becau&s;e they are aver&s;e to the <HI>Ame|rican independency;</HI> but for a great variety of other rea&s;ons, which might be ea&s;ily mentioned; and for the truth of this I appeal to the non-jurors them&s;elves, who can be&s;t explain their own opinions and &s;entiments.</P>
<P>IV. Some of the enjoined oaths contain <HI>facts</HI> which ma|ny do not believe to be true, and <HI>contradictions</HI> which can|not be reconciled.</P>
<P>V. People of the mo&s;t delicate &s;entiments of religion and truth only, <HI>i. e.</HI> the <HI>be&s;t people</HI> in the world, may be <HI>governed</HI> and perhaps <HI>hurt</HI> by them; whil&s;t people of a <HI>con|trary</HI> character will all avail them&s;elves of &s;ome <HI>&s;hift or other</HI> to avoid their whole effects.</P>
<P>VI. The experience of ages and nations proves that this mea&s;ure has ever <HI>failed of producing the effects propo&s;ed and intended</HI> by it. Have we &s;ecured the obedience and good|will of one <HI>American</HI> &s;ubject by it? We have &s;een, with indignation and contempt, the <HI>Briti&s;h generals</HI> rigidly im|po&s;ing <HI>their</HI> oath of allegiance wherever they gained foot|ing, and hanging &s;uch as have relap&s;ed; the con&s;equence is, they have <HI>di&s;affected</HI> and <HI>lo&s;t</HI> all their friends in the

&s;outhern governments lately, and in all the re&s;t long ago; the revolts again&s;t them are nearly univer&s;al.</P>
<P>VII. The real object of the&s;e te&s;ts is not always the <HI>&s;afety of the State;</HI> they are <HI>too often</HI> made u&s;e of as <HI>engines of a ruling party,</HI> to entrap and puni&s;h &s;uch people as they &s;uppo&s;e inimical to <HI>them&s;elves,</HI> and who&s;e conduct is &s;o pru|dent and inoffen&s;ive, that they are not liable to puni&s;hment, but by &s;ome law which creates a crime which can be prov|ed and puni&s;hed <HI>without the evidence of overt acts.</HI> This is the height of <HI>abomination,</HI> a mo&s;t execrable corruption and abu&s;e of the mo&s;t &s;acred rights of law.</P>
<P>VIII. When, by &s;uch wicked tricks, numbers of our freemen are excluded from their <HI>right of election,</HI> and bear|ing their part in the government of the State, the <HI>e&s;&s;ential principle</HI> on which the government of the United States is founded, <HI>is violated.</HI> This principle is, <HI>that all rights of go|vernment lies in the people,</HI> and that <HI>our government</HI> is a go|vernment of <HI>the people;</HI> which cannot be the ca&s;e where numbers of the <HI>people,</HI> who have a right to a &s;hare in it, <HI>are excluded.</HI></P>
<P>It is ea&s;y enough for any party which gets into the &s;ad|dle, to keep their places there, by impo&s;ing &s;ome <HI>condition</HI> which is either <HI>impo&s;&s;ible</HI> or <HI>impracticable,</HI> on all the people of <HI>different</HI> &s;entiments from them&s;elves, <HI>e. g.</HI> they may make the very <HI>point in que&s;tion</HI> between the two parties a <HI>term</HI> of admi&s;&s;ion or exclu&s;ion of the civil privileges and franchi&s;es of the people.</P>
<P>This is a &s;hort way of cutting down oppo&s;ing parties, and de&s;troying their weight in &s;ociety, and changing the very e&s;&s;ence of the Con&s;titution from being the govern|ment of <HI>the people,</HI> to that of being a government of <HI>part</HI> of the people <HI>only:</HI> for there is a very wide difference be|tween a government by major vote of <HI>all the people,</HI> and a government by a major vote of <HI>part of the people,</HI> whil&s;t the <HI>other part</HI> are <HI>excluded</HI> from voting at all; for by this method of proceeding, the governing or voting part may, by repeated exclu&s;ions, reduce the government to a <HI>very &s;mall number,</HI> a mere <HI>junto of a few,</HI> from which the <HI>main body of the people</HI> may be excluded; which is not the free

<HI>government of the people</HI> intended by our Con&s;titution, but a mere unchecked <HI>tyranny of a few.</HI></P>
<P>To effect all which, nothing more is nece&s;&s;ary than this, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> whenever there ari&s;es an oppo&s;ition to any point car|ried by a majority, for that &s;ame majority to require <HI>an oath approving the very point in di&s;pute,</HI> and impo&s;ing a <HI>penal|ty</HI> of exclu&s;ion from <HI>all right of voting,</HI> on &s;uch as refu&s;e the oath, and &s;o go on <HI>toties quoties,</HI> whenever an oppo&s;i|tion ari&s;es. This will effectually exclude the oppo&s;ition from future voting; for men will often <HI>conform</HI> to a mat|ter carried by a majority again&s;t them, who would by no means <HI>&s;wear an approbation</HI> of it.</P>
<P>This may be repeated till there are but two voters left in the whole State, and then one of them has nothing more to do than to kill the other, and he will be <HI>&s;old tyrant,</HI> and will be very &s;afe, if he can get a &s;tanding army to &s;upport him: and this will not be difficult, if he has money e|nough: and this too will be ea&s;y; for the voting part of the community can always lay <HI>what taxes</HI> and <HI>rai&s;e what money they plea&s;e,</HI> and the army which is to receive that mo|ney, can ea&s;ily <HI>enforce the collection</HI> or payment of it.</P>
<P>Nor is this any very unnatural, &s;trained, or extravagant &s;uppo&s;ition; for we have often &s;een <HI>Commonwealths,</HI> by the <HI>fatal errors</HI> of their policy, run into a <HI>monarchical</HI> and <HI>de&s;potic tyranny:</HI> and the only &s;ure way to avoid the fatal con&s;equences of &s;uch errors, is to <HI>nip them in the bud; ob|&s;tare principiis,</HI> to detect their principles, and re&s;train and correct the fir&s;t beginnings of them, before they gain &s;uch &s;trength as to be irre&s;i&s;tible.

<P>To take off all <HI>disfranchi&s;ements and di&s;abilities</HI> created by any of our &s;tatutes, for no other cau&s;e than <HI>neglecting the te&s;t-acts, oath of allegiance,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Te&s;t-acts,</HI> at the time this E&s;&s;ay was written, were deemed &s;o <HI>import|ant,</HI> that any objection to them, or doubt of their u&s;e, was cried out upon and reprobated by the violent party which then prevailed in the State, as <HI>malignancy</HI> again&s;t the <HI>American independence, di&s;affection to the government,</HI> and <HI>a &s;ort of trea&s;on.</HI> I was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and <HI>much threatened</HI> for writing this E&s;&s;ay.

After applying pretty liberally all the hard words he could think of, he gives the character of it as follows&mdash;"Of all publications hitherto exhibited in print, &s;ince the e&s;tabli&s;hment of our independence, this E&s;&s;ay is foremo&s;t in barefaced and undi&s;gui&s;ed principles, to <HI>to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">i&s;m favorable;</HI> to our <HI>Revolution inimical;</HI> and of our <HI>Con&s;titution &s;ubver&s;ive:</HI>" and then goes on to ob&s;erve, that every inde|pendent State ought to be guarded by &s;ome criterion, by which <HI>good</HI> citizens may be di&s;tingui&s;hed from <HI>bad</HI> ones; and that all &s;uch States have good right and authority to adopt any &s;uch criterion or term of citizen&s;hip, which they think proper; and that te&s;t-acts are of this kind, &amp;c.</P>
<P>In my reply, publi&s;hed in the &s;ame <HI>Journal, Oct.</HI> 5, 1781, I urge that te&s;t-acts have no more connexion with the <HI>independent government of the Union,</HI> or the <HI>Con&s;titution of this State,</HI> than with <HI>all other governments;</HI> but they may be nece&s;&s;ary to <HI>toryi&s;m,</HI> as they have been generally mo&s;t <HI>adopted</HI> and <HI>pre&s;&s;ed</HI> in the <HI>weake&s;t</HI> and <HI>wor&s;t governments;</HI>&mdash;that I do not di&s;pute <HI>the authority</HI> of any independent State to make te&s;t-acts; it is the <HI>expediency only</HI> of making them which I object to&mdash;that very many <HI>good</HI> men will <HI>refu&s;e</HI> them, and many <HI>bad</HI> men will <HI>take</HI> them&mdash;that the merits and qualities of citizens ought to be taken and e&s;timated by their <HI>conduct or overt acts,</HI> not by the <HI>&s;ecrets of their hearts,</HI> which are cogni&s;able by GOD <HI>alone,</HI> not by the <HI>State,</HI> till <HI>by overt acts</HI> they are made <HI>known:</HI> the <HI>Con&s;titutionali&s;t</HI> &s;ays, that non-jurors are <HI>aliens,</HI> not <HI>citi|zens;</HI> this I denied; for were they <HI>aliens,</HI> they could not be <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">olden</HI> to any <HI>municipal obedience</HI> or <HI>duties,</HI> &s;uch as <HI>taxes, &s;ervices, &amp;c.</HI> or be <HI>capable of trea|&s;ons,</HI> or <HI>crimes</HI> again&s;t the <HI>State,</HI> to which (if aliens) they could <HI>owe no alle|giance</HI>&mdash;I further urged, that te&s;t-acts, where the mo&s;t that could be, was made of them, amounted to no more than <HI>a man's te&s;timony in his own ca&s;e,</HI> which was not admitted in matters of the &s;malle&s;t moment, and, of cour&s;e, the mo&s;t important of all intere&s;ts ought not to be controlled or limited by it&mdash;that pre&s;&s;ing te&s;t-acts was a &s;ure way to keep alive the mo&s;t <HI>galling frets</HI> and <HI>di&s;contents,</HI> in a State, and was very bad policy even in a <HI>ruling party,</HI> be|cau&s;e the &s;ame mea&s;ures might be <HI>retorted</HI> upon them&s;elves, if they &s;hould happen to &s;lip <HI>out</HI> of the &s;addle, and their <HI>opponents</HI> &s;hould get <HI>into</HI> it.&mdash;</P>
<P>On the whole I much prefer a government which &s;ecures to every man the &s;ecrets of his own mind, and makes him amenable for his conduct and overt acts only, rather than one which intrudes on &s;uch &s;ecrets, and makes the di&s;covery of them on oath a term of the riche&s;t and noble&s;t benefits and privileges of &s;ociety.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">[Fir&s;t publi&s;hed in Philadelphia, April 25, 1781.]</HEAD>
<P>IN my &s;everal treati&s;es on <HI>finance,</HI> I have all along en|deavoured to open and explain the great general prin|ciples of the &s;ubject, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>improvement</HI> of the revenue, and <HI>economy</HI> in the expenditures.

<P>I. <HI>The whole territory or extent of the Thirteen States is the aggregate of them all, i. e.</HI> the territory or extent of each of the States added together, make the whole territo|ry or extent of right and dominion of the United States; and, of cour&s;e, whatever is comprehended within the boundaries of each State, now makes a part of our Com|monwealth.</P>
<P>This is to be con&s;idered as our <HI>pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion,</HI> our pre|&s;ent decided right, which is guarantied to us by the treaty
<PB N="486" REF="023972_0493_0FC2A515CA7EF748">
with <HI>France</HI> (Article XI.) together with any 'additions or conque&s;ts, which our Confederation may obtain during the war, from any of the dominions now or heretofore po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by <HI>Great-Britain</HI> in <HI>North-America;'</HI> &s;o that by conque&s;t we may extend our dominion further, if we can; and, in this ca&s;e, we &s;hall have the guarantee of the treaty afore&s;aid for our &s;ecurity; but if this cannot be done, our pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions are ab&s;olutely and unconditionally gua|rantied to us, with liberty, &s;overeignty, and independence, ab&s;olute and unlimited, in and over the &s;ame.</P>
<P>And as the great intere&s;ts of <HI>France</HI> and our Common|wealth will always make the <HI>perpetual union</HI> of them nece&s;|&s;ary, &s;o the&s;e powers united will be able to afford &s;uch a &s;ure mutual protection to the whole dominions of each other, as will render them wholly &s;ecure and free of dan|ger from any other powers whatever; &s;o that we may &s;afe|ly compute on all the advantages of our pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and turn our thoughts on the ways and means of making the be&s;t of them; while, at the &s;ame time, we have a rich and valuable chance of acquiring by conque&s;t new domi|nions, and having, of cour&s;e, &s;uch new acqui&s;itions co|vered by the &s;ame guarantee which now &s;ecures our pre|&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>Nobody can pretend to deny that our pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions comprehend <HI>all the lands included within the boundaries of the Thirteen States, as the &s;ame exi&s;ted at the time our inde|pendence fir&s;t began;</HI> but it will be &s;trongly urged that they cannot extend <HI>beyond them,</HI> &s;o as to cover any lands not in|cluded within the bounds of <HI>&s;ome one</HI> of the States, unle&s;s we can make a claim to a further extent <HI>by conque&s;t;</HI> in|deed, I do not &s;ee how we can <HI>otherwi&s;e</HI> &s;upport a claim to independence, &s;overeignty, and dominion over any thing which was <HI>not within our bounds</HI> at that time: therefore, it follows,</P>
<P N="1">1. That wherever we fix the <HI>exterior limit or bounds of any one of the States,</HI> there we fix the <HI>bounds of our Common|wealth;</HI> and it will be urged again&s;t us, that all beyond is not our territory, our right, or dominion: and, there|fore,</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="487" REF="023972_0494_0FC2A51989E606F0">
2. It is our intere&s;t <HI>to extend the exterior boundary of each of our States</HI> as far as we <HI>fairly can;</HI> and, of cour&s;e, any attempt (ari&s;ing from envy or any little di&s;putes) to <HI>abridge or reduce the limits of any of the States</HI> to lines &s;hort of their true extent, and &s;o prevent their <HI>covering the whole territo|ry</HI> to which their original charters, or u&s;ual pre&s;criptive ti|tles, give them right, is the <HI>height of folly</HI> and <HI>ab&s;urd policy,</HI> and operates directly again&s;t the great intere&s;t of the Commonwealth.</P>
<P>And here I cannot but take notice of the madne&s;s, &s;hort|&s;ighted policy, and <HI>public mi&s;chief,</HI> of a late pamphlet, en|titled <HI>Public Good,</HI> which, by very weak and trifling argu|ments, attempts to limit the territory of <HI>Virginia</HI> to a ve|ry incon&s;iderable part of its original and true extent. I think &s;ome note of di&s;approbation &s;hould be fixed on that treati&s;e, le&s;t it &s;hould be produced in future debates, as a proof of the general &s;en&s;e of the States at this time.</P>
<P>There is, indeed, as is well known, &s;ome <HI>ob&s;curity of de|&s;cription</HI> to be found in all the <HI>ancient charters</HI> of the&s;e States, which, by that means, admit of a latitude of con|&s;truction; but mo&s;t of the&s;e are reduced to a determinate certainty by <HI>&s;ub&s;equent acts, deci&s;ions, u&s;ages,</HI> &amp;<HI>c.</HI> and, I conceive, that for mo&s;t obvious rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>II. <HI>The boundaries of the &s;everal States are to be taken and a&s;certained from their original charters, &s;uch con&s;truc|tion as has obtained by &s;ub&s;equent u&s;age, judicial deci&s;ions, or any other acts of the crown or the inhabitants, which tend to give them a determinate and fixed definition.</HI> If, in any ca&s;e, no light can be drawn from &s;uch u&s;age or &s;ub&s;equent acts, the particular boundaries mu&s;t depend on the words of the charters, with &s;uch rea&s;onable con&s;truction as &s;hall give them their <HI>greate&s;t effect,</HI> and be <HI>mo&s;t adequate to the original intention</HI> of them, or, in law language, &s;o <HI>ut res magis va|leat quam pereat;</HI> by which rule of con&s;truction, there can be no doubt but <HI>Virginia,</HI> having boundaries &s;ufficiently fixed on the &s;ea-coa&s;t, is <HI>to extend we&s;t,</HI> and <HI>carry her breadth</HI> to the <HI>South-Sea,</HI> or at lea&s;t as far as the <HI>dominion of the crown extended, at the time when American independence fir&s;t began.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="488" REF="023972_0495_0FC2A51D62374ED0">
Two things are &s;ufficiently clear,</P>
<P>1&s;t. That all the States are &s;o bounded on each other, that there are <HI>no &s;trips of land lying between any two of them;</HI> and,</P>
<P>2d. That their we&s;tern boundary is <HI>the South-Sea,</HI> or at lea&s;t the <HI>we&s;tern boundary of the dominions of the crown,</HI> at the commencement of our Commonwealth.</P>
<P>So that the country or territory of the Thirteen States, is clearly bounded on <HI>the we&s;t</HI> as afore&s;aid; on the <HI>&s;outh,</HI> by the &s;outh line of <HI>Georgia</HI> (about N. lat. 30&deg; 22&prime;) on <HI>the ea&s;t,</HI> by the &s;ea, including the i&s;lands lying in the o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ing of the coa&s;t; and <HI>north,</HI> by the north line of the Province of <HI>Maine, New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> and <HI>the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts State</HI> (about N. lat. 45) its <HI>length,</HI> north and &s;outh, is about 1000 <HI>miles;</HI> and its <HI>breadth,</HI> ea&s;t and we&s;t (if it extends no far|ther than the <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi</HI> river) about 600 <HI>miles</HI> on the <HI>&s;outh|ern</HI> part, and 1250 <HI>miles</HI> on the <HI>northern</HI> part.</P>
<P>The contents of which are &s;omewhat more than 810,000 <HI>&s;quare miles;</HI> more than equal to tho&s;e of <HI>France, Spain, Germany,</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> and much more valuable in re&s;pect of air, climate, &s;oil, timber, fo&s;&s;ils, fi&s;heries, harbors, rivers, &amp;c. with all conveniency for tran&s;portation, both by mari|time and inland navigation.</P>
<P>It is further to be noted here, that with re&s;pect to <HI>Virgi|nia,</HI> and &s;ome other governments, which either never had any charters, or who&s;e charters have been &s;urrendered to the crown, that the <HI>&s;oil and juri&s;diction</HI> of them were <HI>both in the crown,</HI> and therefore the King <HI>ever</HI> claimed right to make new grants of &s;oil, and carve out and e&s;tabli&s;h any new juri&s;dictions or governments which he thought expe|dient, and on this principle actually did carve <HI>Maryland</HI> and par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> out of <HI>Virginia;</HI> how ju&s;tly I am not to &s;ay; but this does not hinder <HI>Virginia</HI> from taking her departure from her true ea&s;tern boundary on the &s;ea|coa&s;t, and covering all the lands within her limits (not in|cluded in the&s;e <HI>c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rvatures</HI>) to her utmo&s;t we&s;tern boundary.</P>
<P>It is, indeed, to be ob&s;erved here, that a&s;certaining the boundaries of any State, does not prove the <HI>title or right of &s;uch State to all lands</HI> included within &s;uch boundaries.
<PB N="489" REF="023972_0496_0FC2A51EAF84AC40">
There is a di&s;tinction to be made between tho&s;e lands which have been <HI>alienated by the crown,</HI> the title of which, at the date of our independence, was not in the crown, but ve&s;ted in particular per&s;ons, either &s;ole or aggregate, and tho&s;e which <HI>remained in the crown,</HI> the title of which the crown then held in right of its &s;overeignty, which was a right ve&s;ted in the &s;upreme authority, in nature of a tru&s;t for the u&s;e of the public.</P>
<P>There is no doubt but every right and title of all per&s;ons and bodies politic are as effectually &s;ecured and confirmed to the owners, to all intents and purpo&s;es, under the <HI>Com|monwealth,</HI> as they were formerly <HI>under the crown;</HI> but it cannot be admitted that any individual or bodies politic &s;hould acquire <HI>new rights</HI> by the Revolution, to which they were not entitled under the crown, <HI>i. e.</HI> each State has right to claim, hold, or alienate whatever property or e&s;tate it had right to obtain, hold, or alienate, whil&s;t it was a colony under the crown; but cannot have right to claim, hold, or alienate any e&s;tate, the claim, tenure, or alienation of which was then the right of the crown.</P>
<P>But every &s;uch e&s;tate being then held by the crown in right of &s;overeignty, or its &s;upreme power, in tru&s;t for the u&s;e of the whole community or body politic, of which it was the &s;upreme power, mu&s;t pa&s;s, by the Revolution, in|to the &s;upreme power of our Commonwealth, <HI>i. e.</HI> into the Congre&s;s, and be ve&s;ted in them in tru&s;t for the public u&s;e of the body politic, of which they are the &s;upreme power; and the right of tenure and alienation mu&s;t be ve&s;ted in them alone.</P>
<P>Indeed, in all revolutions of government which have ever happened in <HI>Europe,</HI> and perhaps in the whole world, all <HI>crown-lands, jewels,</HI> and <HI>all other e&s;tate</HI> which belonged to the &s;upreme power which <HI>lo&s;t</HI> the government, ever pa&s;&s;ed by the revolution into the &s;upreme power which <HI>gained</HI> it; and all &s;uch e&s;tate always became ve&s;ted in the <HI>latter</HI> occupant, in the &s;ame condition and under the &s;ame limitations to which it was &s;ubject under the tenure of the <HI>former</HI> occupant.</P>

Nor can I &s;ee the lea&s;t pretence of rea&s;on, why we &s;hould depart from a rule of right grounded on the mo&s;t plain and natural fitne&s;s, adopted by every nation in the world under like circum&s;tances, and ju&s;tified and confirm|ed by the experience and &s;anction of ages. I think that no|thing but our unacquaintedne&s;s with the heights to which we are ri&s;en, the high &s;phere in which we now move, and an incapacity of viewing and judging of things on a great &s;cale, could give ri&s;e to &s;o extravagant an idea, as that <HI>one State</HI> &s;hould be <HI>more entitled than another</HI> to the <HI>crown-lands,</HI> or any other property of the crown, which ever was in its nature public, and ought to continue &s;o, or be di&s;po&s;ed of for the u&s;e and benefit of the whole public community; or that one State &s;hould acquire more right, or property, or e&s;tate than another, by that Revolution which was the <HI>joint act,</HI> procured and perfected by the <HI>joint effort</HI> and <HI>expen&s;e,</HI> of the whole.

<P>III.

<P>IV. Six only of the States have a large <HI>we&s;tern extent</HI> of un&s;ettled lands, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, Connecticut, Virgi|nia, North</HI> and <HI>South-Carolina,</HI> and <HI>Georgia;</HI> the other &s;e|ven are limited within <HI>much narrower</HI> bounds.</P>

<P>For here it is to be con&s;idered, that the expen&s;e of the war is not to be e&s;timated merely by the <HI>ca&s;h</HI> it has co&s;t; but the <HI>deva&s;tations</HI> of the enemy, the lo&s;s of <HI>lives,</HI> &amp;<HI>c.</HI> are to be brought into the account; and when the e&s;timate comes to be made on the&s;e principles, it will ri&s;e very high on &s;uch parts of the intere&s;t defended as could lo&s;e <HI>no lives,</HI> becau&s;e it had <HI>no inhabitants;</HI> and was incapable of <HI>deva&s;ta|tion,</HI> becau&s;e it had <HI>no improvements</HI> which could be de|&s;troyed.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, as all the States have exerted them&s;elves with <HI>equal ardor, danger,</HI> and <HI>effort</HI> in carrying on the war, it is but rea&s;onable they &s;hould all &s;hare <HI>alike</HI> in the <HI>advantages</HI> re&s;ulting from it.

<P>But I deem it needle&s;s to urge this matter farther, becau&s;e I am informed that a general conviction of the expediency of this mea&s;ure prevails thro' all the States, and that it is free|ly agreed on the part of the &s;aid &s;ix States, to make &s;uch a <HI>ce&s;&s;ion</HI> or <HI>grant</HI> to the States-general, as above men|tioned, and that the &s;ame will &s;oon be done.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The foregoing ideas and arguments were &s;uch as were &s;ugge&s;ted at the time when this E&s;&s;ay was fir&s;t publi&s;hed, and were matters of much conver&s;ation and di&s;cu&s;&s;ion both in and out of Congre&s;s, but have all been long &s;ince adju&s;ted and &s;ettled.</P>
<P>The boundaries of the Union were defined in the treaty of peace with <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> in <HI>Feb.</HI> 1783, and extended much beyond the limits here propo&s;ed.</P>

We will &s;uppo&s;e, then, that this is done, and the right and title of the&s;e we&s;tern uncultivated lands ve&s;ted in the States-general; what is to be done with them? <HI>i. e.</HI> how are they to be managed, in order to obtain the greate&s;t na|tional benefit po&s;&s;ible from them?</P>
<P>Some people think we ought to <HI>&s;ell</HI> or <HI>mortgage them to foreign States,</HI> for money in our pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s. But I have many rea&s;ons again&s;t this method. The fir&s;t is,</P>
<P>That it is capable of the mo&s;t demon&s;trative proof, that <HI>no importation of money</HI> can help us, even if it was <HI>given to us,</HI> much le&s;s if our lands are to be <HI>mortgaged</HI> for it. We are in much more danger from <HI>the plenty</HI> of money coming from all quarters in upon us, than from any <HI>&s;carcity of it;</HI> our &s;alvation mu&s;t ari&s;e from the <HI>wealth</HI> and <HI>virtue</HI> which abounds <HI>in the country,</HI> not in hunting <HI>abroad for money.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides, I abhor the very idea of <HI>&s;trangers</HI> having their <HI>paw on any of our lands</HI> in any &s;hape whatever: and,</P>
<P>Further, they would bring <HI>mighty little in</HI> this way, <HI>i. e.</HI> very little <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> benefit, tho' enough of <HI>future</HI> trouble; it would be like killing the goo&s;e that laid an egg every day, in order to tear out at once all that was in her belly. But every idea of this &s;ort is painful to me; I wi&s;h not to dwell longer on it, but beg leave to propo&s;e a method which ap|pears to me more for our advantage.</P>
<P>I. Let the <HI>ceded territory</HI> be divided from the unceded by the plaine&s;t lines, and let it be kept in its pre&s;ent unculti|vated &s;tate, and pre&s;erved from the <HI>intru&s;ion of any &s;ettlers</HI> whatever, by the mo&s;t rigid and effectual prohibitions, till the <HI>lands adjoining</HI> are <HI>fully &s;ettled:</HI> then,</P>
<P><PB N="493" REF="023972_0500_0FC2A08B37D02D70">
II. <HI>Survey out town&s;hips of &s;ix, eight, or ten miles &s;quare,</HI> contiguous to the &s;ettled country, and &s;ell the lands at ven|due to the highe&s;t bidder, on the following conditions:</P>
<P N="1">1. That none be &s;old at le&s;s than a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> dollar per acre.</P>
<P N="2">2. That every purcha&s;er be obliged to &s;ettle and improve his purcha&s;e within two or three years, or forfeit his lands; the particular regulations of which &s;hould be publi&s;hed at the time of &s;ale, and be rigidly executed; and when the <HI>fir&s;t cour&s;e or tier</HI> of town&s;hips are &s;old, and the <HI>&s;ettlement</HI> of them <HI>&s;ecured,</HI> lay out <HI>another tier,</HI> &s;ell them in like man|ner, and &s;o on thro' the whole. This method will have the following advantages, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>
<P N="1">1. All the lands &s;old will bring at lea&s;t a dollar per acre; and if we admit, as above computed, tho&s;e 300,000,000 acres of our we&s;tern territory to become the public proper|ty of the States-general, and allow 100,000,000 acres for lakes, ponds, beds of rivers, barrens, &amp;c. there will remain 200,000,000 acres of good land to be &s;old; which, at a dollar per acre, will produce 200,000,000 <HI>hard dollars</HI> for the trea&s;ury of the United States; the annual intere&s;t of which, at 5 per cent. will be 10,000,000 dollars <HI>per an|num:</HI> a &s;um much more than &s;ufficient to defray the whole public expen&s;es of the Thirteen States, in a time of peace, and, of cour&s;e, a large &s;urplus to be expended on a navy, roads, canals, and many other improvements of our coun|try, with a &s;ufficient &s;um to be laid up for a time of war.</P>
<P N="2">2. This method will pu&s;h our &s;ettlements out in clo&s;e columns, much le&s;s a&s;&s;ailable by the enemy, and more ea|&s;ily defended, than exten&s;ive, thin populations; there will be people here for defence <HI>near the frontiers;</HI> they will have the inducements of a <HI>near intere&s;t</HI> to animate them to the &s;ervice; their cour&s;e of life and acquaintance with the country will render them much <HI>more fit</HI> for the &s;ervice, than people drawn from the interior parts of the country; and the nece&s;&s;ary force may be collected and put into ac|tion <HI>much quicker,</HI> and with much <HI>le&s;s expen&s;e,</HI> than if the &s;ame was drawn from di&s;tant parts.</P>
<P><PB N="494" REF="023972_0501_0FC2A08EF098DF48">
The&s;e and many more and great advantages will natu|rally re&s;ult from our pu&s;hing out our &s;ettlements in clo&s;e columns, which cannot be expected or hoped for from a va&s;tly extended fronti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> thinly inhabited.</P>
<P>Add to this, that every new beginner makes his fir&s;t im|provement <HI>in company of near neighbours,</HI> and at but <HI>&s;mall di&s;tance</HI> from <HI>older &s;ettlements,</HI> much <HI>more ea&s;ily</HI> than he could do alone in a wilderne&s;s, where he could receive <HI>no helps from neighbours,</HI> let his nece&s;&s;ity be ever &s;o great.</P>
<P N="3">3. This method would obviate one abu&s;e very hurtful to new &s;ettlements, mo&s;t injurious to the individuals who fir&s;t migrate and bear the hard&s;hips of fir&s;t cultivation, and which greatly retards the population and improvement of a new country, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>large quantities of land lying unimproved in the hands of non-re&s;idents or ab&s;entees,</HI> who neither dwell on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">and, nor cau&s;e it to be cultivated at all, but their land lies in its wild &s;tate, a <HI>refuge for bears, wolves,</HI> and <HI>other bea&s;ts</HI> of prey, ready to <HI>devour</HI> the produce of the neighbouring farmers, bears no part of the <HI>burden of fir&s;t cultivation,</HI> and keeps the &s;ettlers at an <HI>inconvenient di&s;tance</HI> from each other, and <HI>ob&s;tructs</HI> the growth and riches of the town&s;hips in which it lies; whil&s;t the owner, by the <HI>ri&s;e of the land,</HI> makes a <HI>fortune</HI> out of the <HI>labor</HI> and <HI>toils</HI> of the neigh|bouring cultivators. This is a mo&s;t <HI>cruel way of enriching one man by the labor of another,</HI> and &s;o very hurtful to the cultivation of the country, that it ought to be re&s;trained by the mo&s;t deci&s;ive mea&s;ures.</P>
<P N="4">4. This method will give every inhabitant of the Thir|teen States an equal chance of availing him&s;elf of any ad|vantage of <HI>procuring lands for the accommodation of him&s;elf or family;</HI> whil&s;t, at the &s;ame time, the ceding State will reap great benefit from the <HI>produce</HI> and <HI>trade</HI> of the ad|joining &s;ettlements, which will, at the &s;ame time, become a <HI>&s;ecure barrier</HI> to their frontiers, again&s;t the incur&s;ions of an enemy on that &s;ide.</P>
<P N="5">5. In this method we can <HI>extend our laws, cu&s;toms,</HI> and <HI>civil police</HI> as <HI>fa&s;t</HI> and as <HI>far</HI> as we extend our <HI>&s;ettlements;</HI> of cour&s;e, our frontier people will enjoy every benefit of civil &s;ociety and regular admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice; which
<PB N="495" REF="023972_0502_0FC2A0962D662D58">
cannot take place with equal perfection in the great extent of a thin &s;ettled frontier.</P>
<P N="6">6. Another thing very nece&s;&s;ary to be ob&s;erved in the whole management of this affair is, <HI>to cultivate a good and friendly corre&s;pondence with the Indian natives, by a careful practice of ju&s;tice and benevolence towards them.</HI> They are an innumerable race of people, probably extending over a va&s;t country to the we&s;t &s;eas, and very great advantages may be derived from their trade, if we can gain and pre|&s;erve their confidence.</P>
<P>Whereas nobody ever yet gained any thing by an <HI>Indian</HI> war. <HI>Their &s;poils are of no value; but their revenge and de|predations are terrible. It is much cheaper to purcha&s;e their lands, than to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s them by force; and ju&s;tice in all ca&s;es is more profitable than violence and wrong.</HI></P>
<P>It may be noted here, that many inhabitants are already on the lands &s;uppo&s;ed to be ceded. What is to be done with them? I an&s;wer&mdash;if their continuance is matter of <HI>unea&s;ine&s;s to the Indians,</HI> and is likely to produce broils with them, they are by all means to be <HI>removed.</HI> For it is un|rea&s;onable that the public tranquillity &s;hould be endangered for the &s;ake of the convenience of a few people, who, <HI>without the lea&s;t pretence of right,</HI> have fixed them&s;elves down on lands <HI>not their own.</HI></P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding this, if their continuance will not endanger the public &s;ecurity, let them keep their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions on expre&s;s condition, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that, when the town&s;hips in which their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions &s;hall be included when the future &s;urveys &s;hall be made, &s;hall be &s;old, they &s;hall pay as much for their lands as the other purcha&s;ers of the &s;ame town|&s;hip pay on an average for theirs, excluding every idea of favor, to which they may think them&s;elves entitled for their <HI>fir&s;t migration</HI> and <HI>cultivation.</HI> For I e&s;teem all this very wrong and injurious to the public, which rather de&s;erves puni&s;hment than reward.</P>
<P>But there is another objection more forcible, which, I &s;up|po&s;e, will be pretty readily made to my &s;cheme, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> all the benefits of this &s;cheme are <HI>future,</HI> are a great <HI>way off;</HI> but we want <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> &s;upplies, to relieve the pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ities
<PB N="496" REF="023972_0503_0FC2A099C2699D60">
of our country. This was <HI>E&s;au'</HI>s argument, when he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">old his birthright for a me&s;s of pottage, and is certainly a very good one, when really grounded on fact; for no doubt a man had better give his whole fortune for <HI>one meat</HI> of vic|tuals, than <HI>&s;tarve to death</HI> for want of it; but I think wi&s;e men will examine this fact very clo&s;ely, and be very deci|dedly convinced, that the <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed</HI> pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ity is <HI>really</HI> great enough to induce us to forego all the fore-mentioned advantages for the &s;ake of the pittance, the trifle of money which tho&s;e lands would now bring, if &s;old or mortgaged at pre&s;ent for the utmo&s;t they would bring, attended with all the &s;hocking and mortifying di&s;advantages of giving any foreigners a footing in our country, and a claim upon our mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential and central intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>But I think the objection it&s;elf is grounded on an error; for I think the pre&s;ent advantages re&s;ulting from my plan greater than could ari&s;e from any kind of mortgage or ali|enation of the&s;e lands; for I con&s;ider them like a <HI>rich, va|luable, and &s;ure rever&s;ion,</HI> which never fails to give the owner a great e&s;timation, credit, and re&s;pectability in the eyes of his neighbours, tho' he receives no pernancy of pre&s;ent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> profits; but if this rever&s;ion was &s;old or mortgaged for a trifle, and &s;oon di&s;&s;ipated (as doubtle&s;s would be our ca&s;e) the owner would appear in a light more contemptible, and in every view much more di&s;advantageous, than if he had never owned the right.</P>
<P>It cannot be too often repeated, that <HI>we are not capable of being &s;aved, or even helped, by the importation of foreign money;</HI> it will de&s;troy our <HI>indu&s;try,</HI> it will introduce <HI>luxury;</HI> the increa&s;e of <HI>quantity</HI> and <HI>ea&s;e of acquirement will depre|ciate it,</HI> and thereby defeat its own u&s;es.</P>
<P>This is as true as the diurnal rotation of the earth, but, like it, not obvious to the perceptions of every mind. Un|happy for us! the <HI>nature of money,</HI> and the <HI>radical e&s;&s;ence</HI> of the <HI>public finance,</HI> depend on principles <HI>too latent</HI> for ea&s;y comprehen&s;ion; and what makes the matter more danger|ous, like many delu&s;ive appearances in the natural world, is, they &s;eem to be perfectly ea&s;y and obvious, when they are lea&s;t under&s;tood; and therefore it has been ob&s;erved in
<PB N="497" REF="023972_0504_0FC2A09AEFCA8EE0">
all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, that they work like <HI>magic</HI> under the direction of un&s;kilful men, ever producing <HI>effects</HI> the <HI>lea&s;t expected,</HI> as well as failing of tho&s;e <HI>mo&s;t &s;anguinely</HI> computed upon.</P>
<P>Their operations, like other doctrines which depend on an infinity of relations, are governed by &s;o many co-ope|rating cau&s;es, that their delineation is very difficult, and their demon&s;tration intricate, and not to be under&s;tood without a long and deep attention.</P>
<P>They make a part of the <HI>great law of proportions,</HI> which nature never fails to regulate and adju&s;t with perfect exactne&s;s, but which the greate&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t intellects, with the mo&s;t nervous attention, can but <HI>imperfectly com|prehend.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore, in this, as in all other branches of phy&s;ical knowledge, our &s;afe&s;t cue and &s;ure&s;t principles mu&s;t be drawn from experiment. But to return to my &s;ubject&mdash;</P>
<P>I do not apprehend the actual pernancy of profits from our we&s;tern lands, when di&s;po&s;ed of according to my plan, &s;o very di&s;tant as many may imagine. The argument of ana|logy, from what has been to what will be, is generally al|lowed to be a good one. If, therefore, upon this rule of rea&s;oning, we may &s;uppo&s;e that the increa&s;e of population in our country &s;hall continue the &s;ame in time to come as we have experienced in time pa&s;t, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that the number of &s;ouls double once in 25 years, it will appear very probable that our own eyes may live to &s;ee the commencement of a great demand and rapid &s;ale of our we&s;tern territory. The number of &s;ouls in the Thirteen States in 1775, was gene|rally computed at 3,000,000. [Some people of great ob|&s;ervation were of opinion, this number was much exceed|ed.] On the afore&s;aid &s;cale of computation, the number of &s;ouls in the&s;e States, at the end of the next century, will amount to 96,000,000; enough to extend over the whole territory of our Commonwealth, and more than <HI>Spain, France, Germany,</HI> and <HI>Italy</HI> now contain.</P>
<P N="7">7. I will here &s;ubjoin one thing more, which may per|haps be thought worthy of &s;ome con&s;ideration, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that in &s;urveying and granting the we&s;tern lands, all &s;altlicks, and mines of metallic ores, coals, minerals, and all other
<PB N="498" REF="023972_0505_0FC2A0A39810B888">
valuable fo&s;&s;ils (in all which the country greatly abounds) may be re&s;erved and &s;eque&s;tered for public u&s;e: a great revenue may grow out of them: and it &s;eems unrea&s;onable that tho&s;e va&s;t &s;ources of wealth &s;hould be engro&s;&s;ed and monopolized by any individuals. I think they ought to be improved to the be&s;t public advantage, but in &s;uch manner, that the va&s;t pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;uing from them &s;hould flow into the public trea&s;ury, and thereby inure to the equal advantage of the whole community.</P>
<P>The foregoing con&s;iderations open to view &s;uch great ob|jects, &s;uch pro&s;pects of va&s;t population and national wealth, as may at fir&s;t &s;ight appear chimerical, illu&s;ory, and incre|dible. A great mini&s;ter of &s;tate was formerly &s;o a&s;toni&s;h|ed at the very mention of the va&s;t &s;upplies predicted by the prophet <HI>Eli&s;ha,</HI> that he, with amazement mixed with un|belief, exclaimed, <HI>"If the Lord would make windows in heaven, might this thing be!"</HI> But I mean to &s;ubject this E&s;&s;ay to the mo&s;t rigid examination. Plea&s;e to review eve|ry propo&s;ition, and clo&s;ely examine every argument and in|ference I make, and if they do not ju&s;tify the conclu&s;ion, reject them; but if you find the facts alleged, true, the propo&s;itions ju&s;t, and the inferences fairly drawn, do not &s;tart at your own good fortune, or &s;hrink from the ble&s;|&s;ings which Heaven pours on your country. The bounda|ries herein de&s;cribed, by which the contents of our terri|tories are computed, are taken from <HI>Mitchel'</HI>s map, pub|li&s;hed in 1755, at the reque&s;t of the Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners of Trade and Plantations, and is chiefly compo&s;ed from draughts, charts, and actual &s;urveys of different parts of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> colonies and plantations in <HI>America,</HI> great part of which have been lately taken by their Lord&s;hips' orders, and tran&s;mitted to the plantation-office, as is certified by <HI>John Pownal,</HI> &s;ecretary of &s;aid office, and is perhaps a map of the be&s;t authority and greate&s;t accuracy of any ex|tant. The facts are of public notoriety. The computa|tions are all made on obvious principles, and may be cor|rected by any body, if wrong. The &s;entiments are my own, and are cheerfully &s;ubmitted to the mo&s;t rigorous &s;crutiny that can con&s;i&s;t with truth and candor. The &s;ub|ject
<PB N="499" REF="023972_0506_0FC2A0A4BAEFDC30">
is very large; I do not pretend to exhau&s;t it, or that this E&s;&s;ay is a fini&s;hed piece; it is a &s;ketch only, a draught of outlines, which, I hope, will be allowed to de&s;erve at lea&s;t a candid attention. I wi&s;h it might be &s;ufficient to produce a full conviction, that it cannot be the intere&s;t of the United States either, 1&s;t. to &s;uffer &s;uch va&s;t and valua|ble ble&s;&s;ings to be ravi&s;hed from us by our enemies; or, 2d. to con&s;ent to their being &s;old and alienated to fo|reigners, for any little, trifling pre&s;ent con&s;iderations; &s;uch fooli&s;h bargains mu&s;t originate in very narrow views of the &s;ubject, and terminate in &s;hame and lo&s;s, and in every &s;tage be marked with mortification, di&s;putes, and embar|ra&s;&s;ment.</P>
<P>I will conclude by ju&s;t ob&s;erving, that this E&s;&s;ay is whol|ly confined to one branch only, to one &s;ingle re&s;ource, of our public revenue; only one item of our national wealth: an income va&s;t indeed, not drawn at all from the pur&s;es of the people, but capable of being &s;o conducted, that every individual who choo&s;es to be intere&s;ted in it, may find a good profit re&s;ulting from the concern. I do not doubt but if the whole great &s;ubject was properly &s;urveyed by a mind capable of &s;uch reflections, many other &s;ources of revenue might be found, of va&s;t utility to the public, and in no &s;en&s;e injurious, but highly profitable, to individuals. So to graft the revenue on the public &s;tock, &s;o to unite and combine public and private intere&s;ts, that they may mutu|ally &s;upport, feed, and quicken each other, is the &s;ecret art, the true &s;pirit of financiering; but we mu&s;t never lo&s;e &s;ight of this one great truth, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that all re&s;ources of pub|lic wealth and &s;afety are only materials put into our hands for improvement, and will prove either profitable or hurt|ful according to the wi&s;dom or folly with which they are managed. Ruin may grow out of national wealth, as well as from national poverty. Perhaps it may require more great and good talents to &s;upport an affluent fortune than a narrow one. Affluence has at lea&s;t as many dangers as indigence. All depends on the characters of the men who manage them. The happine&s;s and wretchedne&s;s of na|tions depend on the abilities and virtue of the men em|ployed
