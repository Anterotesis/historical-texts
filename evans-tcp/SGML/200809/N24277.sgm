<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P>THE charge of bla&s;phemy, which is put upon the record again&s;t the printer of this publi|cation is not an accu&s;ation of the &s;ervants of the crown, but comes before you &s;anctioned by the oaths of a grand jury of the country. It &s;tood for trial upon a former day; but it happening, as it fre|quently does, without any imputation upon the gentlemen named in the pannel, that a &s;ufficient number did not appear to con&s;titute a full &s;pecial jury, I thought it my duty to withdraw the cau&s;e from trial, till I could have the opportunity which is now open to me of addre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf to you, who were originally appointed to try it. I pur&s;ued this cour&s;e, however, from no jealou&s;y of the common juries appointed by the laws for the ordinary &s;ervice of the court, &s;ince my whole life has been one con|tinued experience of their virtues; but becau&s;e I thought it of great importance, that tho&s;e who were
<PB N="4" REF="032093_0003_0FF11AFF99368F30">
to decide upon a cau&s;e &s;o very momentous to the public, &s;hould have the highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible qualifica|tions for the deci&s;ion: that they &s;hould not only be men capable from their educations of forming an enlightened judgment, but that their &s;ituations &s;hould be &s;uch as to bring them within the full view of their enlightened country, to which, in character and in e&s;timation, they were in their own turns to be re&s;pon&s;ible.</P>
<P>Not having the honour, Gentlemen, to be &s;worn for the king as one of his coun&s;el, it has fallen much oftener to my lot to defend indictments for li|bels, than to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the pro&s;ecution of them. But I feel no embarra&s;&s;ment from that recollection; &s;ince I &s;hall not be found to-day to expre&s;s a &s;entiment, or to utter an expre&s;&s;ion, incon&s;i&s;tent with tho&s;e in|valuable principles for which I have uniformly con|tended in the defence of others. Nothing that I have ever &s;aid, either profe&s;&s;ionally or per&s;onally, for the liberty of the pre&s;s, do I mean to-day to contradict or counteract. On the contrary, I de&s;ire to preface the very &s;hort di&s;cour&s;e I have to make to you with reminding you, that it is your mo&s;t &s;olemn duty to take care that it &s;uffers no injury in your hands. A free and unlicen&s;ed pre&s;s <HI>(in the ju&s;t and legal &s;en&s;e of the expre&s;&s;ion)</HI> has led to all the ble&s;&s;ings both of religion and government, which Great Bri|tain or any part of the world at this moment enjoys, and is calculated &s;till farther to advance mankind to higher degrees of civilization and happine&s;s. But this freedom, like every other, mu&s;t be limited to be enjoyed, and like every human advantage, may be defeated by its abu&s;e.</P>
<P>Gentlemen! the defendant &s;tands indicted for having publi&s;hed this book, which I have only read from the obligations of profe&s;&s;ional duty, and which I ro&s;e from the reading of with a&s;toni&s;hment and di&s;gu&s;t. Standing here with all the privileges be|longing to the highe&s;t coun&s;el for the crown, I &s;hall
<PB N="5" REF="032093_0004_0FF11B02786EBF30">
be entitled to reply to any defence that &s;hall be made for the publication. I &s;hall wait with patience till I hear it. Indeed, if I were to anticipate the de|fence which I hear and read of, it would be defaming by anticipation the learned coun&s;el who is to make it. For if I am to collect it, even from a formal notice given to the pro&s;ecutors in the cour&s;e of the proceedings, I have to expect, that, in&s;tead of a defence conducted according to the rules and prin|ciples of Engli&s;h law and ju&s;tice, the foundation of all our laws, and the &s;anctions of all our ju&s;tice, are to be &s;truck at and in&s;ulted. What is the force of that juri&s;diction which enables the court to &s;it in judgment? What but the oath which his Lord&s;hip, as well as your&s;elves, have &s;worn upon the go&s;pel to fulfil? Yet in the king's court, where his Ma|je&s;ty is him&s;elf al&s;o &s;worn to admini&s;ter the ju&s;tice of England&mdash;in the king's court&mdash;who receives his high authority under a &s;olemn oath to maintain the Chri&s;tian religion, as it is promulgated by God in the Holy Scriptures, I am neverthele&s;s called upon as coun&s;el for the pro&s;ecution, to produce a certain book de&s;cribed in the indictment to be the Holy Bible. No man de&s;erves to be upon the rolls of the court, who dares, as an attorney, to put his name to &s;uch a notice. It is an in&s;ult to the authority and dignity of the court of which he is an officer; &s;ince it &s;eems to call in que&s;tion the very foundations of its juri&s;diction. If this is to be the &s;pirit and tem|per of the defence; if, as I collect from that array of books which are &s;pread upon the benches behind me, this publication is to be vindicated by an attack of all the truths which the Chri&s;tian religion pro|mulgates to mankind, let it be remembered that &s;uch an argument was neither &s;ugge&s;ted nor ju&s;tified by any thing &s;aid by me on the part of the pro&s;ecu|tion. <HI>In this &s;tage of the proceedings,</HI> I &s;hall call for reverence to the Sacred Scriptures, not from their merits, unbounded as they are, but from their au|thority
<PB N="6" REF="032093_0005_0FF0D3EDCC74C438">
in a Chri&s;tian country&mdash;not from the obliga|tions of con&s;cience, but from the rules of law. For my own part, Gentlemen, I have been ever deeply devoted to the truths of Chri&s;tianity; and my firm belief in the Holy Go&s;pel is by no means owing to the prejudices of education (though I was religi|ou&s;ly educated by the be&s;t of parents), but ari&s;es from the fulle&s;t and mo&s;t continued reflections of my riper years and under&s;tanding. It forms at this moment the great con&s;olation of a life, which, as a &s;hadow, mu&s;t pa&s;s away; and without it, indeed, I &s;hould con&s;ider my long cour&s;e of health and pro&s;perity (perhaps too long and too uninterrupted to be good for any man) only as the du&s;t which the wind &s;catters, and rather as a &s;nare than as a ble&s;&s;|ing. Much, however, as I wi&s;h to &s;upport the au|thority of Scripture from a rea&s;oned con&s;ideration of it, I &s;hall repre&s;s that &s;ubject for the pre&s;ent. But if the defence &s;hall be as I have &s;u&s;pected, to bring them at all into argument or que&s;tion, I &s;hall then fulfil a duty which I owe not only to the court, as coun&s;el for the pro&s;ecution, but to the public, to &s;tate what I feel and know concerning the evidences of that religion which is reviled without being exa|mined, and denied without being under&s;tood.</P>
<P>I am well aware that by the communications of a free pre&s;s, all the errors of mankind, from age to age, have been di&s;&s;ipated and di&s;pelled; and I re|collect that the world, under the banners of reformed Chri&s;tianity, has &s;truggled through per&s;ecution to the noble eminence on which it &s;tands at this mo|ment, &s;hedding the ble&s;&s;ings of humanity and &s;ci|ence upon the nations of the earth. It may be a&s;ked, by what means the reformation would have been effected, if the books of the reformers had been &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and the errors of condemned and exploded &s;uper&s;titions had been &s;upported as unque&s;|tionable by the &s;tate, founded upon tho&s;e very &s;u|per&s;titions formerly, as it is at pre&s;ent upon the doc|trines
<PB N="7" REF="032093_0006_0FF11B07AB828108">
of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church? Or how, upon &s;uch principles, any reformation, civil or religious can in future be effected? The &s;olution is ea&s;y:&mdash; Let us examine what are the genuine principles of the liberty of the pre&s;s, as they regard writings upon general &s;ubjects, unconnected with the per|&s;onal reputations of private men, which are wholly foreign to the pre&s;ent inquiry. They are full of &s;implicity, and are brought as near perfection, by the law of England, as, perhaps, is con&s;i&s;tent with any of the frail in&s;titutions of mankind.</P>
<P>Although every community mu&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h &s;u|preme authorities, founded upon fixed principles, and mu&s;t give high powers to magi&s;trates to admini&s;ter laws for the pre&s;ervation of the government it&s;elf, and for the &s;ecurity of tho&s;e who are to be protected by it: yet, as infallibility and perfection belong neither to human e&s;tabli&s;hments nor to human indi|viduals, it ought to be the policy of all free e&s;ta|bli&s;hments, as it is mo&s;t peculiarly the principle of our own con&s;titution, to permit the mo&s;t unbounded freedom of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, even by detecting errors in the con&s;titution or admini&s;tration of the very govern|ment it&s;elf, &s;o as that decorum is ob&s;erved, which every &s;tate mu&s;t exact from its &s;ubjects, and which impo&s;es no re&s;traint upon any intellectual compo&s;i|tion, fairly, hone&s;tly, and decently addre&s;&s;ed to the con&s;ciences and under&s;tandings of men. Upon this principle, I have an unque&s;tionable right (a right which the be&s;t &s;ubjects have exerci&s;ed) to examine the principles and &s;tructure of the con&s;titution, and by fair, manly rea&s;oning, to que&s;tion the practice of its admini&s;trators. I have a right to con&s;ider and to point out errors in the one or in the other; and not merely to rea&s;on upon their exi&s;tence, but to con&s;i|der the means of their reformation. By &s;uch free, well-intentioned, mode&s;t, and dignified communi|cation of &s;entiments and opinions, all nations have been gradually improved, and milder laws and purer
<PB N="8" REF="032093_0007_0FF11B0A8B018528">
religions have been e&s;tabli&s;hed. The &s;ame princi|ples, which vindicate civil contentions hone&s;tly di|rected, extend their protection to the &s;harpe&s;t con|trover&s;ies on religious faiths. This rational and le|gal cour&s;e of improvement was recognized and ratified by Lord Kenyon, as the law of England, in a late trial at Guildhall, when he looked back with gratitude to the labours of the reformers, as the fountains of our religious emancipation, and of the civil ble&s;&s;ings that followed in their train. The Engli&s;h con&s;titution, indeed, does not &s;top &s;hort in the toleration of religious <HI>opinions,</HI> but liberally ex|tends it to <HI>practice.</HI> It permits every man, EVEN PUBLICLY to wor&s;hip God according to his own con&s;cience, though in marked di&s;&s;ent from the na|tional e&s;tabli&s;hment, &s;o as he profe&s;&s;es the general faith, which is the &s;anction of all our moral duties, and the only pledge of our &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the &s;y&s;tem which con&s;titutes a &s;tate. Is not this &s;y&s;tem of free|dom of controver&s;y, and freedom of wor&s;hip, &s;uffi|cient for all the purpo&s;es of human happine&s;s and improvement? And can it be nece&s;&s;ary for either, that the law &s;hould hold out indemnity to tho&s;e who wholly abjure and revile the government of their country, or the religion on which it re&s;ts for its foundation? I expect to hear, in an&s;wer to what I am now &s;aying, much that will offend me. My learned friend, from the difficulties of his &s;ituation, which I know, from experience, how to feel for very &s;incerely, may be driven to advance propo&s;i|tions which it may be my duty, with much freedom, to reply to; and the law will &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ction that freedom. But will not the ends of ju&s;tice be completely an|&s;wered by that right, to point out the errors of his di&s;cour&s;e in terms that are decent, and calculated to expo&s;e its defects; or will any argument &s;uffer, or will public ju&s;tice be impeded, becau&s;e neither pri|vate honour and ju&s;tice, nor public decorum, would endure my telling my very learned friend, that he
<PB N="9" REF="032093_0008_0FF11B0EB45E9208">
was a fool, a liar, and a &s;coundrel, in the face of the court, becau&s;e I differed from him in argument or opinion? This is ju&s;t the di&s;tinction between a book of free legal controver&s;y and the book which I am arraigning before you. Every man has a legal right to inve&s;tigate, with mode&s;ty and decency, con|trover&s;ial points of the Chri&s;tian religion; but no man, con&s;i&s;tently with a law, which only exi&s;ts un|der its &s;anctions, has a right not only broadly to deny its very exi&s;tence, but to pour forth a &s;hock|ing and in&s;ulting invective, which the lowe&s;t e&s;ta|bli&s;hments in the gradations of civil authority ought not to be permitted to &s;uffer, and which &s;oon would be borne down by in&s;olence and di&s;obedience, if they did.</P>
<P>The &s;ame principle pervades the whole &s;y&s;tem of the law, not merely in its ab&s;tract theory, but in its daily and mo&s;t applauded practice.&mdash;The inter|cour&s;e between the &s;exes, and which, properly regu|lated, not only continues, but humanizes and adorns our natures, is the foundation of all the thou&s;and romances, plays, and novels, which are in the hands of every body. Some of them lead to the confirma|tion of every virtuous principle; others, though with the &s;ame profe&s;&s;ion, addre&s;s the imagination in a manner to lead the pa&s;&s;ions into dangerous exce&s;&s;es. But though the law does not nicely di&s;criminate the various &s;hades which di&s;tingui&s;h the&s;e works from one another, &s;o as that it &s;uffers many to pa&s;s, through its liberal &s;pirit, that upon principle might be &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed, would it or does it tolerate, or does any decent man contend that it ought to pa&s;s by unpu|ni&s;hed, libels of the mo&s;t &s;hamele&s;s ob&s;cenity, mani|fe&s;tly pointed to debauch innocence, and to bla&s;t and poi&s;on the morals of the ri&s;ing generation? This is only another illu&s;tration to demon&s;trate the ob|vious di&s;tinction between the work of an author, who fairly exerci&s;es the powers of his mind, in in|ve&s;tigating doctrinal points in the religion of any
<PB N="10" REF="032093_0009_0FF11B103B1876B8">
country, and him who attacks the rational exi&s;tence of every religion, and brands with ab&s;urdity and folly the &s;tate which &s;anctions, and the obedient tools who cheri&s;h the delu&s;ion. But this publication appears to me to be as mi&s;chievous and cruel in its probable effects, as it is manife&s;tly illegal in its principles; becau&s;e it &s;trikes at the be&s;t, &s;ometimes, alas! the only refuge and con&s;olation amid&s;t the di&s;tre&s;&s;es and afflictions of the world. The poor and humble, whom it affects to pity, may be &s;tabbed to the heart by it. They have more occa&s;ion for firm hopes beyond the grave, than tho&s;e who have greater comforts to render life delightful. I can conceive a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed but virtuous man, &s;urrounded by children, looking up to him for bread when he has none to give them, &s;inking under the la&s;t day's labour, and unequal to the next, yet &s;till looking up with confidence to the hour when all tears &s;hall be wiped from the eyes of affliction, bearing the burden laid upon him by a my&s;terious Providence which he adores, and looking forward with exultation to the revealed promi&s;es of his Creator, when he &s;hall be greater than the greate&s;t, and happier than the hap|pie&s;t of mankind. What a change in &s;uch a mind might not be wrought by &s;uch a mercile&s;s publica|tion? Gentlemen! whether the&s;e remarks are the overcharged declamations of an accu&s;ing coun&s;el, or the ju&s;t reflections of a man anxious for the public freedom, which is be&s;t &s;ecured by the morals of a na|tion, will be be&s;t &s;ettled by an appeal to the pa&s;&s;ages in the work, that are &s;elected by the indictment for your con&s;ideration and judgment. You are at liber|ty to connect them with every context and &s;equel, and to be&s;tow upon them the milde&s;t interpretation. [<HI>Here Mr. Er&s;kine read and commented upon &s;ever<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l of the &s;elected pa&s;&s;ages, and then proceeded as follows:</HI>] &mdash;Gentlemen, it would be u&s;ele&s;s and di&s;gu&s;ting to enumerate the other pa&s;&s;ages within the &s;cope of the indictment. How any man can rationally vin|dicate
<PB N="11" REF="032093_0010_0FF11B129A6F6520">
the publication of &s;uch a book, in a country where the Chri&s;tian religion is the very foundation of the law of the land, I am totally at a lo&s;s to con|ceive, and have no ideas for the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of. How is a tribunal, who&s;e whole juri&s;diction is found|ed upon the &s;olemn belief and practice of what is denied as fal&s;ehood, and reprobated as impiety, to deal with &s;uch an anomalous defence? Upon what principle is it even offered to the court, who&s;e au|thority is contemned and mocked at? If the religion propo&s;ed to be called in que&s;tion, is not previou&s;ly adopted in belief and &s;olemnly acted upon, what authority has the court to pa&s;s any judgment at all of acquittal or condemnation? Why am I now, or upon any other occa&s;ion, to &s;ubmit to your lord|&s;hip's authority? Why am I now, or at any time, to addre&s;s twelve of my equals, as I am now addre&s;&s;ing you, with reverence and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion? Under what &s;anction are the witne&s;&s;es to give their evidence, without which there can be no trial? Under what obligations can I call upon you, the jury repre&s;ent|ing your country, to admini&s;ter ju&s;tice? Surely upon no other than that you are &s;worn to admini&s;ter it under the oaths you have taken. The whole judicial fabric, from the king's &s;overeign authority to the lowe&s;t office of magi&s;tracy, has no other foundation. The whole is built, both in form and &s;ub&s;tance, upon the &s;ame oath of every one of its mini&s;ters to do ju&s;tice AS GOD SHALL HELP THEM HEREAFTER. What God? And what hereafter? That God, undoubtedly, who has commanded kings to rule, and judges to decree with ju&s;tice; who has &s;aid to witne&s;&s;es, not by the voice of nature, but in revealed commandments&mdash;THOU SHALT NOT BEAR FALSE TESTIMONY AGAINST THY NEIGHBOUR; and who has enforced obedience to them by the re|velation of the unutterable ble&s;&s;ings which &s;hall at|tend their ob&s;ervance, and the awful puni&s;hments which &s;hall await upon their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. But it
<PB N="12" REF="032093_0011_0FF11B1556ED6E38">
&s;eems, this is an age of rea&s;on, and the time and the per&s;on are at la&s;t arrived, that are to di&s;&s;ipate the er|rors which have over&s;pread the pa&s;t generations of ignorance. The believers in Chri&s;tianity are many, but it belongs to the few that are wi&s;e to correct their credulity. Belief is an act of rea&s;on, and &s;uperior rea&s;on may, therefore, dictate to the weak. In run|ning the mind along the long li&s;t of &s;incere and de|vout Chri&s;tians, I cannot help lamenting, that New|ton had not lived to this day, to have had his &s;hal|lowne&s;s filled up with this new flood of light.&mdash;But the &s;ubject is too awful for irony. I will &s;peak plainly and directly. Newton was a Chri&s;tian! Newton, who&s;e mind bur&s;t forth from the fetters ca&s;t by nature upon our finite conceptions&mdash;Newton, who&s;e &s;cience was truth, and the foundation of who&s;e knowledge of it was philo&s;ophy&mdash;not tho&s;e vi&s;ion|ary and arrogant pre&s;umptions, which too often u&s;urp its name, but philo&s;ophy re&s;ting upon the ba&s;is of mathematics, which, like figures, cannot lie&mdash;Newton, who carried the line and rule to the uttermo&s;t barriers of creation, and explored the principles by which, no doubt, all created matter is held together and exi&s;ts. But this extraordinary man, in the mighty reach of his mind, overlooked, perhaps, the errors, which a minuter inve&s;tigation of the created things on this earth might have taught him, of the e&s;&s;ence of his Creator. What &s;hall then be &s;aid of the great Mr. Boyle, who looked into the organic &s;tructure of all matter, even to the brute inanimate &s;ub&s;tances which the foot treads on? Such a man may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have been equally qualified with Mr. Paine to look up through nature to nature's God. Yet the re&s;ult of all his contem|pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">on was the mo&s;t confirmed and devout belief in all which the other holds in contempt, as de&s;picable and drivelling &s;uper&s;tition.&mdash;But this error might, perhaps, ari&s;e from a want of due attention to the
<PB N="13" REF="032093_0012_0FF11B17132590C8">
foundations of human judgment, and the &s;tructure of that under&s;tanding which God has given us for the inve&s;tigation of truth.&mdash;Let that que&s;tion be an|&s;wered by Mr. Locke, who was, to the highe&s;t pitch of devotion and adoration, a Chri&s;tian&mdash;Mr. Locke, who&s;e office was to detect the errors of thinking, by going up to the fountains of thought, and to direct into the proper track of rea&s;oning, the devious mind of man, by &s;hewing him its whole proce&s;s, from the fir&s;t perceptions of &s;en&s;e to the la&s;t conclu&s;ions of ratiocination, putting a rein be&s;ides upon fal&s;e opinion, by practical rules for the conduct of human judgment. But the&s;e men were only deep thinkers, and lived in their clo&s;ets, unaccu&s;tomed to the traffic of the world, and to the laws which practically regulate mankind.</P>
<P>Gentlemen! in the place were we now &s;it to admini&s;ter the ju&s;tice of this great country, above a century ago, the never-to-be-forgotten Sir Matthew Hale pre&s;ided; who&s;e faith in Chri&s;tianity is an ex|alted commentary upon its truth and rea&s;on, and who&s;e life was a glorious example of its fruits in man, admini&s;tering human ju&s;tice with a wi&s;dom and purity drawn from the pure fountain of the Chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation, which has been, and will be, in all ages, a &s;ubject of the highe&s;t reverence and admiration. But it is &s;aid by the author, that the Chri&s;tian fable is but the tale of the more ancient &s;uper&s;titions of the world, and may be ea&s;ily de|tected by a proper under&s;tanding of the mythologies of the Heathens. Did Milton under&s;tand tho&s;e mythologies? Was <HI>he</HI> le&s;s ver&s;ed than Mr. Paine in the &s;uper&s;titions of the world? No, they were the &s;ubject of his immortal &s;ong; and though &s;hut out from all recurrence to them, he poured them forth from the &s;tores of a memory rich with all that man ever knew, and laid them in their order as the il|lu&s;tration of that real and exalted faith, the unque&s;|tionable

<L>He &s;aw, till, bla&s;ted with exce&s;s of light,</L>
<L>He clos'd his eyes in endle&s;s night.</L></Q>
But it was the light of the BODY only that was extingui&s;hed: "The cele&s;tial light &s;hone inward, and enabled him to ju&s;tify the ways of God to man." The re&s;ult of his thinking was neverthele&s;s not the &s;ame as the author's. The my&s;terious incarnation of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour (which this work bla&s;phemes in words &s;o wholly unfit for the mouth of a Chri&s;tian, or for the ear of a court of ju&s;tice, that I dare not, and will not, give them utterance) Milton made the grand conclu&s;ion of the <HI>Paradi&s;e Lost,</HI> the re&s;t from his fini&s;hed labours, and the ultimate hope, expecta|tion, and glory of the world.</P>

<P>The immortal poet having thus put into the mouth of the angel the prophecy of man's redemp|tion, follows it with that &s;olemn and beautiful ad|monition, addre&s;&s;ed in the Poem to our great fir&s;t parent, but intended as an addre&s;s to his po&s;terity through all generations:
<Q><L>This having learn'd, thou ha&s;t attain'd the &s;um</L>

<P><PB N="15" REF="032093_0014_0FF11B1DFAFEE3D8">Thus you find all that is great, or wi&s;e, or &s;plen|did, or illu&s;trious, among&s;t created beings; all the minds gifted beyond ordinary nature, if not in&s;pired by its univer&s;al Author for the advancement and dig|nity of the world, though divided by di&s;tant ages, and by cla&s;hing opinions, di&s;tingui&s;hing them from one another, yet joining as it were in one &s;ublime chorus, to celebrate the truths of Chri&s;tianity, and laying upon its holy altars the never-fading of|ferings of their immortal wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>Again&s;t all this concurring te&s;timony, we find &s;uddenly, from the author of this book, that the Bible teaches nothing but "lies, ob&s;cenity, cruelty, and inju&s;tice." Has he ever read our Saviour's &s;ermon on the Mount, in which the great princi|ples of our faith and duty are &s;ummed up?&mdash;Let us all but read and practi&s;e it; and lies, ob&s;cenity, cruelty, and inju&s;tice, and all human wickedne&s;s, will be bani&s;hed from the world!"</P>
<P>Gentlemen! there is but one con&s;ideration more, which I cannot po&s;&s;ibly omit, becau&s;e I confe&s;s it affects me very deeply. The author of this book has written largely on public liberty and govern|ment; and this la&s;t performance has, on that ac|count, been more widely circulated, and principally among tho&s;e who attached them&s;elves from principle to his former works. This circum&s;tance renders a public attack <HI>upon all revealed religion</HI> from &s;uch a writer infinitely more dangerous. The religious and moral &s;en&s;e of the people of Great Britain, is the great anchor which alone can hold the ve&s;&s;el of the &s;tate amid&s;t the &s;torms which agitate the world; and if I could believe for a moment, that the ma&s;s of the people were to be debauched from the princi|ples of religion, which forms the true ba&s;is of that humanity, charity, and benevolence, that has been &s;o long the national characteri&s;tic, in&s;tead of mixing my&s;elf, as I &s;ometimes have done, in political refor|mations, I would rather retire to the uttermo&s;t
<PB N="16" REF="032093_0015_0FF11B1F88F891E0">
corners of the earth, to avoid their agitation; and would bear, not only the imperfections and abu&s;es complained of in our own wi&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hment, but even the wor&s;t government that ever exi&s;ted in the world, rather than go to the work of reformation with a multitude &s;et free from all the charities of Chri&s;tianity, who had no &s;en&s;e of God's exi&s;tence, but from Mr. Paine's ob&s;ervation of nature, which the ma&s;s of mankind have no lei&s;ure to contemplate; nor any belief of future rewards and puni&s;hments, to animate the good in the glorious pur&s;uit of human happine&s;s, nor to deter the wicked from de|&s;troying it even in its birth. But I know the people of England better. They are a religious people, and, with the ble&s;&s;ing of God, as far as it is in my power, I will lend my aid to keep them &s;o. I have no objections to the free&s;t and mo&s;t extended di&s;|cu&s;&s;ions upon doctrinal points of the Chri&s;tian reli|gion, and <HI>though the law of England does not permit it,</HI> I do not dread the rea&s;oned arguments of Dei&s;ts again&s;t the exi&s;tence of Chri&s;tianity it&s;elf, becau&s;e, as was &s;aid by its divine Author, if it is of God it will &s;tand. An intellectual book, however erro|neous, addre&s;&s;ed to the intellectual world upon &s;o profound and complicated a &s;ubject, can never work the mi&s;chief which this indictment is calcu|lated to repre&s;s. Such works will only employ the minds of men enlightened by &s;tudy, to a deeper inve&s;tigation of a &s;ubject well worthy of their deepe&s;t and continued contemplation. The powers of the mind are given for human improvement in the progre&s;s of human exi&s;tence. The changes pro|duced by &s;uch reciprocations of lights and intelli|gences are certain in their progre&s;&s;ions, and make their way imperceptibly, as conviction comes upon the world, by the final and irre&s;i&s;tible power of truth. If Chri&s;tianity be founded in fal&s;ehood, let us become Dei&s;ts in this manner, and I am contented. But this book has no &s;uch object, and no &s;uch
<PB N="17" REF="032093_0016_0FF11B211C3E1658">
capacity: it pre&s;ents no arguments to the wi&s;e and enlightened. On the contrary, it treats the faith and opinions of the wi&s;e&s;t with the mo&s;t &s;hocking contempt, and &s;tirs up men, without the advantages of learning, or &s;ober thinking, to a total di&s;belief of every thing hitherto held &s;acred; and con&s;e|quently to a rejection of all the laws and ordinances of the &s;tate, which &s;tand only upon the a&s;&s;umption of their truth. Gentlemen, I cannot conclude with|out expre&s;&s;ing the deepe&s;t regret at all attacks upon the Chri&s;tian religion by authors who profe&s;s to pro|mote the civil liberties of the world. For under what other au&s;pices than Chri&s;tianity have the lo&s;t and &s;ubverted liberties of mankind in former ages been re-a&s;&s;erted? By what zeal, but the warm zeal of devout Chri&s;tians, have Engli&s;h liberties been redeemed and con&s;ecrated? Under what other &s;anc|tions, even in our own days, have liberty and happi|ne&s;s been extending and &s;preading to the uttermo&s;t corners of the earth? What work of civilization, what commonwealth of greatne&s;s, has this bald religion of nature ever e&s;tabli&s;hed? We &s;ee, on the contrary, the nations that have no other light than that of nature to direct them, &s;unk in barba|ri&s;m, or &s;laves to arbitrary governments; whil&s;t, &s;ince the Chri&s;tian aera, the great career of the world has been &s;lowly, but clearly advancing, lighter at every &s;tep, from the awful prophecies of the Go&s;pel, and leading, I tru&s;t, in the end to univer&s;al and eternal happine&s;s. Each generation of mankind can &s;ee but a few revolving links of this mighty and my&s;terious chain; but by doing our &s;everal duties in our allotted &s;tations, we are &s;ure that we are fulfilling the purpo&s;es of our exi&s;tence. YOU, I tru&s;t, will fulfil yours this day!</P></Q>

<P>A Mr. <HI>Fleming,</HI> one of the clerks of the Bank, was the only witne&s;s called on the part of the pro&s;ecution. He &s;aid, he purcha&s;ed the book in que&s;tion of the defendant, at his &s;hop, on the 7th of February la&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="032093_0017_0FF11B22D186E0A0">The NOTICE which Mr. ERSKINE mentioned in his &s;peech was here read, and Mr. JOHN MARTIN, the attorney for the defendant, readily admitted that he had &s;ent it to tho&s;e who were concerned for the pro&s;ecution.</P>
<P>Mr. KYD made a very learned and ingenious &s;peech for the defendant. He &s;aid he would endea|vour to di&s;charge the important duty which he owed to his client, in a manner that was con&s;i&s;tent with the dignity of that court, and with that decency and &s;olemnity which, he felt, belonged to the &s;ubject. The que&s;tion was, whether the author, when he wrote this book, felt as he wrote, and expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf as he felt. He humbly &s;ubmitted, that the inferences which Mr. Paine had drawn from the pre|mi&s;es, were &s;uch as he might have drawn with a fair and hone&s;t intention. Whether tho&s;e inferences were ju&s;t or not, was totally a different que&s;tion. But, if his lord&s;hip and the gentlemen of the jury could di&s;cover no wicked or malicious intent, they would not puni&s;h a man for a mere error in judgment. If the jury could collect no wicked intention in the author from reading the whole of this performance, he contended he was completely protected under the right which he and every other man had to exerci&s;e the powers of his mind in di&s;cu&s;&s;ing any controver&s;ial points of religion. Suppo&s;ing then the book had been written innocently, he might infer, as a general propo&s;ition, that it was al&s;o publi&s;hed with an inno|cent intention. At the &s;ame time he admitted, that what was &s;o written, might be publi&s;hed from a ma|licious motive, for which the publi&s;her would be amenable to the laws of his country. The learned coun&s;el next &s;elected &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages from this per|formance, to &s;hew, that the author felt the mo&s;t profound reverence and veneration for the Supreme Being, and denied the truth of revelation only be|cau&s;e he could not reconcile it to the character and attributes of the Deity. It was &s;tated in that publi|cation,
<PB N="19" REF="032093_0018_0FF11B26884FF9B8">
that the law of nature was engraven on every man's heart, and that he might clearly collect the knowledge of that duty which he owed to his Creator from a contemplation of his works. Mr. Kyd next endeavoured to ju&s;tify the charges made upon the Bible by the author, by a variety of pa&s;&s;ages which he &s;elected, but which, at the de&s;ire of his lord&s;hip and the jury, he did not read, but only referred to them, and contended, that if tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages were found in any other book, they would be con&s;idered as indecent and immoral. He appealed to the wri|tings of Dr. Lardner, Dr. Bentley, and other emi|nent divines, in &s;upport of the right of free di&s;cu&s;&s;ion upon all &s;ubjects of a controver&s;ial nature. He then &s;poke in &s;evere terms of this pro&s;ecution, which, he &s;aid, would never have been in&s;tituted, had it not been for Bi&s;hop WATSON's APOLOGY, which had been very widely circulated, and had excited a cu|rio&s;ity to read the book, to which it was an an&s;wer; and to gratify that public curio&s;ity, it was, that this book, which, he believed, had been fir&s;t publi&s;hed at Paris, was afterwards publi&s;hed in this country. Mr. Kyd in&s;i&s;ted, at great length, upon the freedom of inquiry, and a free pre&s;s, and gave the reforma|tion and revolution as two in&s;tances of the ine&s;ti|mable ble&s;&s;ings which had re&s;ulted from them to this country.</P>
<P>Mr. ERSKINE made a mo&s;t eloquent reply. He &s;aid, he was bound, in re&s;pect to his learned friend, as a member of a mo&s;t honourable profe&s;&s;ion, to &s;uppo&s;e, that he was placed in a very irk&s;ome &s;itua|tion, to be called on for a defence &s;o exceedingly difficult to make, and &s;o extremely delicate to ma|nage, without violating that common decency that was due to a court of ju&s;tice. He could not there|fore help con&s;idering him as entitled to a con&s;idera|ble degree of indulgence. Mr. Er&s;kine here ad|verted to &s;everal of the pa&s;&s;ages &s;elected from the Old Te&s;tament by Mr. Kyd, and explained the
<PB N="20" REF="032093_0019_0FF11B291B6002C8">
rea&s;on of their introduction into the &s;acred writings. The hi&s;tory of man he &s;aid, was the hi&s;tory of man's vices and pa&s;&s;ions, which could not be cen&s;ured without adverting to their exi&s;tence; and many of the in&s;tances that had been referred to, were re|corded as memorable warnings and examples for the in&s;truction of mankind. Mr. E. next entered mo&s;t forcibly and deeply into the evidences of Chri&s;tianity, particularly tho&s;e that were founded on that &s;tupendous &s;cheme of prophecy, which formed one of the mo&s;t unan&s;werable arguments for the truth of the Chri&s;tian religion. "It was not," he &s;aid, "the purpo&s;e of God to de&s;troy free agency by overpowering the human mind with the irre&s;i&s;tible light and conviction of revelation, but to leave men to collect its truths, as they were gradually illu&s;trated in the accompli&s;hment of the divine promi&s;es of the Go&s;pel. Bred as he was to the con&s;ideration of evi|dence, he declared he con&s;idered the prophecy con|cerning the de&s;truction of the Jewi&s;h nation, if there was nothing el&s;e to &s;upport Chri&s;tianity, ab&s;olutely irre&s;i&s;tible. The divi&s;ion of the Jews into tribes, to pre&s;erve the genealogy of Chri&s;t, the di&s;tinction of the tribe of Judah, from which he was to come; the lo&s;s of that di&s;tinction when that end was accom|pli&s;hed; the predicted departure of the &s;ceptre from I&s;rael; the de&s;truction of the temple of Jeru&s;alem, which imperial munificence in vain attempted to re|build to di&s;grace the prophecy; the di&s;per&s;ion of this nation over the face of the whole earth, the &s;preading of the Go&s;pel throughout the world; the per&s;ecutions of its true mini&s;ters, and the foretold &s;uper&s;titions which for ages had defiled its wor&s;hip&mdash;the&s;e were topics upon which Mr. Er&s;kine expatiated with great eloquence, and produced a mo&s;t powerful effect on every part of the audience. He concluded with a vindication of the authors of this pro&s;ecution. He &s;aid, they were men of the highe&s;t character and greater con&s;ideration in the country. Many of them
<PB N="21" REF="032093_0020_0FF11B2AB48B10A8">
were charged with the offices of religion; others of them were clothed with the robes of magi&s;tracy; mo&s;t of them were men of deep learning and think|ing; and all of them ju&s;tly entitled to the thanks of the public for their noble exertions in the cau&s;e of religion and virtue.</P>

<P>"BEING now in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the facts of this ca&s;e, and convinced, in my own mind, what con|clu&s;ion ought to be drawn from them, I am not &s;ure, that it is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay any thing at all to you upon the &s;ubject. Gentlemen, before you proceed to de|cide on the merits of this or any other cau&s;e, it is proper to &s;ee whether the parties litigating &s;tand in a fair light before you. I was extremely hurt when the learned coun&s;el for the defendant thought fit to &s;tate to you, with very con&s;iderable empha&s;is, and a very determined tone of voice, that this was a &s;can|dalous pro&s;ecution. I cannot help wi&s;hing that &s;en|tence had not been uttered. Who commenced this pro&s;ecution I certainly know not. But from what fell from the very learned coun&s;el who has ju&s;t &s;at down, I am inclined to &s;uppo&s;e it proceeded from a &s;ociety of gentlemen in&s;tituted for the mo&s;t important of all purpo&s;es, for pre&s;erving the morals of the people; a &s;ociety compo&s;ed of clergymen, and laymen of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable character in the kingdom, who, feeling how the country is overrun with profligacy and wickedne&s;s, which boldly rai&s;e their heads in defiance of the law of the land, were determined to &s;ee whether, in the fir&s;t place, by admonition and advice, they could not &s;top the torrent of vice and immorality; and &s;econdly, if that &s;hould fail, to try what could be done by puni&s;hment. If people with the very be&s;t intentions carry on pro&s;ecutions that are oppre&s;&s;ive, the end may not always perhaps
<PB N="22" REF="032093_0021_0FF11B2C6B70E150">
&s;anctify the means. But the manner in which this pro&s;ecution has been conducted, is certainly not op|pre&s;&s;ive; for in&s;tead of proceeding in the more ex|pen&s;ive mode, the pro&s;ecutors went before a grand jury of the country: and it was nece&s;&s;ary to ob|tain the opinion of that grand jury before the party could be put in proce&s;s.&mdash;Gentlemen! we &s;it here in a Chri&s;tian a&s;&s;embly to admini&s;ter the laws of the land, and I am to take my knowledge of what the law is from that which has been &s;anctioned by a great variety of legal deci&s;ions. I am bound to &s;tate to you what my predece&s;&s;ors in Mr. Wool&s;ton's ca&s;e (2 Strange, 834) &s;tated half a century ago in this court, of which I am an humble member, namely, that the Chri&s;tian religion is part of the law of the land. Chri&s;tianity from its earlie&s;t in&s;titution met with its oppo&s;ers. Its profe&s;&s;ors were very &s;oon called upon to publi&s;h their apologies for the doc|trines they had embraced. In what manner they did that, and whether they had the advantage of their adver&s;aries, or &s;unk under the &s;uperiority of their arguments, mankind for near two thou&s;and years have had an opportunity of judging. They have &s;een what Julian, Ju&s;tin Martyr, and other apologi&s;ts have written, and have been of opinion the argument was in favour of tho&s;e very publica|tions. The world has been lately favoured with another apology from a mo&s;t learned and re&s;pectable prelate, who calls his work <HI>An Apology for the Chri&s;tian Religion.</HI> I &s;hall not decide between the merits of the one and the other. The publications them&s;elves are in the hands of the world; and I &s;in|cerely wi&s;h, in the concluding language of the work to which I have ju&s;t referred (I do not affect to u&s;e the very words), I &s;incerely wi&s;h that the author of the work in que&s;tion may become a partaker of that faith in revealed religion, which he has &s;o gro&s;sly defamed, and may be enabled to make his peace with God for that di&s;order which he has endeavoured
<PB N="23" REF="032093_0022_0FF11B31387D3650">
to the utmo&s;t of his power to introduce into &s;ociety. We have heard to-day, that the light of nature, and the contemplation of the works of creation, are &s;ufficient, without any other revelation of the divine will. Socrates, Plato, Xenophon, Tully&mdash;each of them in their turns profe&s;&s;ed they wanted other lights; and knowing and confe&s;&s;ing that God was good, they took it for granted the time would come when he would impart a farther revelation of his will to mankind. Though they walked as it were through a cloud, darkly, they hoped their po&s;terity would almo&s;t &s;ee God face to face. This condition of mankind has met with reprehen&s;ion to-day. But I &s;hall not pur&s;ue this argument; fully impre&s;&s;ed with the great truths of religion, which, thank God, I was taught in my early years to believe, and which the hour of reflection and inquiry, in&s;tead of producing any doubt, has fully confirmed me in. I expected the learned coun&s;el for the defendant would have differed the ca&s;e of the publi&s;her from that of the author of this work; that he would have en|deavoured to convince you that whatever guilt might belong to the author, nothing was imputable to the publi&s;her. He has, however, to my utter &s;urpri&s;e, exactly rever&s;ed the ca&s;e. He tells you it was ori|ginally publi&s;hed at Paris in 1794; that the feelings of the author's friends were wounded by this work, which I call a nefarious publication, and that it was in a great mea&s;ure forgotten; and you are now called upon to judge of the merits or demerits of the publi&s;her, who has brought forth a &s;till-born work, forgotten by every body, till he ventured, in defiance of the verdicts of mankind on the author's political works, to &s;end it forth among the inhabitants of this country. Unle&s;s it was for the mo&s;t malignant pur|po&s;es, I cannot conceive how it was publi&s;hed. It is however for you to judge of it, and to do ju&s;tice between the public and defendant."</P>
