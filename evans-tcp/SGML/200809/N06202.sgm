<HEAD>Deeds of Charity Rewarded, at the Judgment-Day, with everla&s;ting Ble&s;|&s;edne&s;s.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>MATT. XXV. 34, 35, 40.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>Then &s;hall the King &s;ay unto them on his right hand, come, ye ble&s;&s;ed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat; I was thir&s;ty, and ye gave me drink; I was a &s;tranger and ye took me in.&mdash;Verily, I &s;ay unto you, ina&s;much as ye have done it unto one of the lea&s;t of the&s;e my brethren, ye have done it unto me.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE pa&s;&s;age of &s;cripture, of which the words I have read to you are a part, contain an account of the proce&s;s of the great and general judgment: an account, perhaps, the mo&s;t ob&s;ervable of any to be met with, in a &s;ingle view, throughout the new-te&s;tament.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="007869_0004_102DECADAD800E58">
IT might be <Q>profitable for our in&s;truction in righteou&s;ne&s;s,</Q> to go over the particulars of this account: But the limits to which I am confined will not allow of this, nor indeed to di&s;cour&s;e upon every thing worthy of notice in the text it &s;elf.</P>
<P>THREE things only may come under con&s;idera|tion, at pre&s;ent, as being of more &s;ignal importance.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. The influence of deeds of charity on the &s;en|tence that will be pronounced, at the general judgment, on the righteous.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. The particular and di&s;tinct mention that is here made of this kind of deeds before any other.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. The endearing manner in which our Saviour, the great Judge of the world, &s;peaks of deeds of charity.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>I. THE fir&s;t thing to be con&s;idered is, the operation of deeds of charity with re&s;pect to the &s;entence, which will be pronounced on the righteous, at the judgment. The &s;entence is that, ver. 34. <Q>Come, ye ble&s;&s;ed of my Father, inherit the kingdom pre|pared for you from the foundation of the world.</Q>
<PB N="7" REF="007869_0005_102DECB01BD68A88">
And then follows, ver. 35, the influence of charity on the procurement of this happy &s;entence, <Q>For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat; I was thir&s;ty, and ye gave me drink,</Q> and &s;o on.</P>
<P>OUR Lord, you &s;ee, has connected the &s;entence, at the judgment-day, which pronounces and makes men ble&s;&s;ed, with deeds of charity to the needy and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. This kind of deeds therefore are of &s;er|vice, in &s;ome &s;en&s;e or other, in order to the procure|ment of this &s;entence.</P>
<P>BUT the que&s;tion is, what is their influence? How do they operate to the obtainment of ble&s;&s;edne&s;s at the judgment?</P>
<P>IN an&s;wer whereto, we may be &s;ure, they are of no u&s;e, have no influence, as the <HI>meritorious</HI> cau&s;e, ground, or rea&s;on, of this ble&s;&s;edne&s;s. The church of <HI>Rome</HI> may think highly of the value of good works, hoping to be bid, at the judgment, to inherit God's heavenly kingdom, on account of the <HI>worthine&s;s</HI> of them; and they may &s;upport them&s;elves in their hope, from what our Lord has &s;aid in my text. But they certainly mi&s;take his meaning. To &s;peak of works, whether of righteou&s;ne&s;s or charity, as merito|rious
<PB N="8" REF="007869_0006_102DECB370823680">
of heavenly ble&s;&s;edne&s;s is an ab&s;urdity too gro&s;s to be entertained by any, who are allowed the free u&s;e of their rea&s;on, and the word of God.</P>
<P>'TIS one of the mo&s;t obvious truths, that all that we have, and are, we derive from God. Not only our ability, but our very inclination, to every good work, is the free gift of God. The apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> therefore makes tho&s;e appeals, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> iv. 7 <Q>Who maketh thee to differ from another? and what ha&s;t thou that thou did&s;t not receive?</Q> And his rea&s;on|ing hereupon is &s;trictly conclu&s;ive; <Q>Now, if thou did&s;t receive it, why do&s;t thou glory as if thou had&s;t not received it?</Q> This &s;ame apo&s;tle makes that &s;olemn challenge, <HI>Rom.</HI> xi. 35. <Q>Who hath fir&s;t given to him?</Q> If any are able to an&s;wer and &s;ay, we have given to God that which we did not fir&s;t re|ceive from him they may then claim, as is conceded in the next words, <Q>to have it recompen&s;ed to them again.</Q> But as no meer man could ever ju&s;tly plead thus, it mu&s;t forever be acknowledged, that an admi&s;&s;ion to ble&s;&s;edne&s;s in heaven is a reward of grace, and not of debt. E&s;pecially,</P>
<P>IF it be con&s;idered, that, when we have done our all in &s;erving God, and doing good to men, we have done only our duty. And where is the merit of this?
<PB N="9" REF="007869_0007_102DECB589E3D088">
As our Saviour argues, <HI>Luk.</HI> xvii. 9, 10. <Q>Doth he thank that Servant, becau&s;e he did the things that were commanded him? I trow not. So likewi&s;e ye, when ye have done all tho&s;e things which are commanded you, &s;ay, we are unprofitable &s;ervants, we have done that which was our duty to do.</Q> And we have the more rea&s;on, after we have done our all, to e&s;teem our&s;elves "unprofitable &s;ervants," becau&s;e our be&s;t &s;ervices carry in them &s;o great a mixture of frailty and imperfection, and are accompanied with &s;o many faults and follies, that we &s;tand ab&s;olutely in need of the pity and mercy of God. Be&s;ides all which,</P>
<P>"Our goodne&s;s extendeth not unto God:" Nor if we are ever &s;o righteous, or charitable, can we "be profitable to the Almighty." Excellent is the rea&s;on|ing in the book of <HI>Job</HI> to this purpo&s;e. "Is it any plea&s;ure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? or gain to him, that thou make&s;t thy ways perfect? Look to the heavens, and &s;ee, and behold the clouds which are higher than thou. If thou &s;inne&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">, what do&s;t thou again&s;t him? Or if thy tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions be multiplied, what doth thou unto him? If thou be righteous, what give&s;t thou him? Or what receiveth he of thine hand?" The words are a mo&s;t &s;olemn check to the fond conceit, we are too apt to entertain of our&s;elves, and of the &s;ignificancy of our &s;ervices, as they re&s;pect
<PB N="10" REF="007869_0008_102DECB7C9118C68">
God. When we look up to the heavens, and behold the &s;ky, and the clouds, we &s;ee them to be high above us: But the great God is &s;till infinitely higher; exalted far above all heavens, and as far beyond the reach of being affected by any conduct of our's to|wards him. We may be ready to indulge the tho't, as if the glorious God was mightily di&s;&s;erved by our &s;ins, and as much benefited by our acts of goodne&s;s: But this is altogether a vain imagination. If we are wicked, it's no hurt to the Almighty: Nor if we are righteous, is he at all advantaged by it. He is neither the wor&s;e for our &s;ins committed again&s;t him; nor the better, tho' we &s;hould make our ways perfect before him. And whatever our carriage is, he unchangeably remains the &s;ame ble&s;&s;ed God forever more. How impo&s;&s;ible is it then, that we &s;hould <HI>merit</HI> at his hands! If he receives nothing from us, if he is nothing bettered by any goodne&s;s of our's, all tho't of <HI>de&s;ert</HI> mu&s;t be totally laid a&s;ide; e&s;pecially that mo&s;t vain of all imaginations, the pretence of <HI>merit|ing</HI> &s;o great a reward from God as heaven, and the everla&s;ting ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of it.</P>
<P>BUT tho' all claim of reward upon the foot of works, in point of <HI>merit,</HI> mu&s;t be forever excluded; yet are they far from being u&s;ele&s;s. And works of charity may properly be con&s;idered as having &s;ome
<PB N="11" REF="007869_0009_102DECB973971B88">
influence on the be&s;towment of ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, at the judgment-day. And their influence &s;eems to lie in this, that they are among tho&s;e fruits of faith and love, which, as there is opportunity therefor, are made requi&s;ite, in the go&s;pel-covenant, in order to our be|ing qualified for the rewards of the heavenly kingdom. It having plea&s;ed God, of his meer mercy, upon the account of Chri&s;t, for his &s;ake, and in virtue of his merits, to make the promi&s;e of heavenly everla&s;ting ble&s;&s;edne&s;s to per&s;ons &s;o and &s;o qualified, our having "fed the hungry, and cloathed the naked," and this, from a principle of faith that has wrought in the&s;e effects of love, operates to our advantage, at the judg|ment, as it declares us to be the per&s;ons that are qualified, according to the go&s;pel-&s;cheme, for the kingdom, God has prepared from the foundation of the world.</P>
<P>WHEN therefore our Saviour, in the text, pro|nounces the happy &s;entence on the righteous, "come ye ble&s;&s;ed of my Father"&mdash;, and adds this account of the matter, "FOR I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat"&mdash;, his de&s;ign is, not to point out the proper cau&s;e, the meritorious ground, of this reward; but the connection the go&s;pel has made between the reward, and the way to it. He would hereby, in the &s;tronge&s;t manner, give us to under&s;tand, the nece&s;&s;ity of deeds of charity in order to an admi&s;&s;ion to future
<PB N="12" REF="007869_0010_102DECBCE3F46438">
ble&s;&s;edne&s;s; and that there can be no &s;uch thing, ac|cording to the con&s;titution of the go&s;pel-covenant, as our being tho't <HI>meet,</HI> at the general judgment, to in|herit the kingdom of God, unle&s;s we are the &s;ubjects of that faith, which has wro't by love, not only love to God, but to our brother al&s;o, evidencing it's reality by all proper acts of beneficence, as there has been opportunity therefor.</P>
<P>IN a word, the chief thing aimed at by our Lord is, to a&s;&s;ert the ab&s;olute and indi&s;pen&s;ible nece&s;&s;ity of deeds of charity, &s;o far as God gives opportunity; to declare it, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn and formal manner, that if we have this world's goods, and are of &s;uch a temper as that we can "&s;ee our brother have need, and &s;hut up our bowels of compa&s;&s;ion from him," we &s;hall in no wi&s;e be counted worthy, at the judg|ment-day, to receive the &s;entence, "come, ye ble&s;&s;ed of my father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world"!&mdash;But I may not enlarge any further here. To go on,</P>
<P>II. THE &s;econd thing ob&s;ervable in the text, is the particular and di&s;tinct mention of deeds of charity, rather than any other. "I was an hungred, and ye ye gave me meat; I was thir&s;ty, and ye gave me drink",&mdash;You ob&s;erve, deeds of charity are the on|ly
<PB N="13" REF="007869_0011_102DECBEA9243618">
ones our Lord his in&s;tanced in. And the&s;e are &s;in|gled out, and mentioned with particularity, and di&s;|tinctne&s;s.</P>
<P>"Not but that many (as one expre&s;&s;es it) will be found at the right hand of Chri&s;t, who never were in a capacity to "feed the hungry, or cloth the naked"; but were them&s;elvs both fed and cloathed by the charity of others." 'Tis particularly recorded of <HI>Lazarus</HI> a poor beggar, &s;o reduced as to de&s;ire to be "fed with the crumbs which fell from <HI>Dives'</HI>s ta|ble", that, when he died, he was "carried by the angels to <HI>Abraham'</HI>s bo&s;om". And, to &s;ay the lea&s;t, as great numbers from among the poor, as from among the rich, will hereafter be admitted into the kingdom of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>NEITHER may we think, becau&s;e works of charity are here particularly mentioned, that other good works are needle&s;s; or that the&s;e will atone for the want of the other. Charity is not here &s;ingled out to exclude the concurrence of other chri&s;tian virtues. We may not imagine, that 'tis of little con&s;i|deration how a man lives in other re&s;pects, if he is but bountiful in his di&s;tributions to the nece&s;&s;itous. No; how plea&s;ing &s;oever the &s;acrifice of alms may be to
<PB N="14" REF="007869_0012_102DECC19E566350">
the Father of mercies, 'twill be of no account, another day, if we are negligent of our duty in other regards. We mu&s;t be pious towards God, &s;ober as to our&s;elves, and righteous, as well as charitable, towards our neigh|bour: Nor otherwi&s;e &s;hall we, at the judgment, be pronounced "good and faithful &s;ervants," and be bid to "enter into the joy of our Lord."</P>
<P>BUT if other works be&s;ides charitable ones are thus nece&s;&s;ary, why, you will &s;ay, are the&s;e latter &s;in|gled out, and di&s;tingui&s;hed, as it were, from the re&s;t?</P>
<P>SEVERAL good rea&s;ons may be a&s;&s;igned for this; and they are the&s;e that follow.</P>
<P>ONE may be obviou&s;ly collected from the very &s;entence it&s;elf, which is here pa&s;&s;ed on the righteous. For 'tis a &s;entence of mercy; pronounced, not ac|cording to the rigors of ju&s;tice, but the allowances of grace. Our Lord and Judge is now exerci&s;ing the mo&s;t illu&s;trious act of grace towards righteous men: And what works &s;o proper to be particularly mention|ed by name as works of mercy? At &s;uch a time as this, there &s;eems to be a &s;pecial fitne&s;s in our Saviour's taking a di&s;tinct notice of the charitable deeds, which good men have done, in obedience to his go&s;pel, and in relief of tho&s;e who needed their compa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="007869_0013_102DECC343AC1BF8">
IT ought al&s;o to be remembred, that deeds of cha|rity are often performed in &s;o &s;ecret a manner, that they will never be known, unle&s;s they are revealed at the day of judgment. Many good men &s;o punctually, in many ca&s;es, ob&s;erve the direction of their Lord, that they &s;uffer not their "left hand to know what their right hand does," in the article of "giving alms," Their good deeds to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed members of Je&s;us Chri&s;t lie concealed from the knowledge of the world. 'Tis not imagined, and would &s;carcely be believed, how frequently, and with what liberality, they make di&s;tributions to the nece&s;&s;ities of the &s;aints. And is it fit &s;o much goodne&s;s &s;hould forever be buried in &s;e|crecy? It &s;hall not, but, according to the promi&s;e of Chri&s;t him&s;elf, be opened to the world, and rewarded. So we read, <HI>Matt.</HI> vi. 3, 4. "When thou do&s;t alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doth, that thine alms may be in &s;ecret: And thy Father, which &s;eeth in &s;ecret, him&s;elf &s;hall reward thee openly." Our Lord might, probably, have in view this promi&s;ed reward; &s;o wording his account of the judgment, as to a&s;&s;ure good men, that all their deeds of charity &s;hould then be openly acknowledged, and particularly related, to their eternal honor, before the general a&s;&s;embly of men and angels.</P>
<P>ANOTHER rea&s;on of this conduct of our Lord might be, the great &s;tre&s;s he has laid upon the duty
<PB N="16" REF="007869_0014_102DECC56304FF10">
of charity, in the new-te&s;tament-writings. Of all the duties we owe to our neighbour, there is no one, per|haps, in the whole &s;y&s;tem of chri&s;tian morality, that is more particularly, frequently, and pre&s;&s;ingly ur|ged upon us. That we &s;hould love one another, not in profe&s;&s;ion only, but with a love expre&s;&s;ing it&s;elf in all in&s;tances of beneficence, was the great me&s;&s;age the Son of God came into the world to deliver to us. So we are told, 1 <HI>John</HI> iii. 2. "This is the me&s;&s;age ye have heard from the beginning, that ye &s;hould love one another." The law of love, as di&s;covering it&s;elf "in deed and in truth, and not in word and tongue" only, is emphatically the law of chri&s;tianity. Says our Saviour, <HI>John</HI> xv. 12. "This is MY command|ment, that ye love one another." Says the apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> in his name, <HI>Col.</HI> iii. 14, "Above all the&s;e things put on charity." And the apo&s;tle <HI>John</HI> &s;o connects the duty of loving one another with the fir&s;t and great du|ty of loving God, that if we do not love one another, neither can we love God. His words are the&s;e, 1 <HI>John</HI> iii. 17. "But who&s;o hath this world's goods, and &s;eeth his brother have need, and &s;hutteth up his bowels of compa&s;&s;ion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him"? The manner of diction im|ports a mo&s;t vehement denial. It does not dwell in him, be his pretences what they will. In fine, this charity is made &s;o to enter into the very being of chri&s;tianity it&s;elf, as that, without it, we are not allow|ed
<PB N="17" REF="007869_0015_102DECC8DD1A7C38">
the character of real chri&s;tians. To this purpo&s;e we read. 1 <HI>John</HI> iii. 10. "In this the children of God are manife&s;t, and the children of the devil; who&s;oever doth not righteou&s;ne&s;s is not of God: neither he that loveth not his brother." So in the 14th ver. "We know that we have pa&s;&s;ed from death to life, becau&s;e we love the brethren: He that loveth not his bro|ther, abideth in death." Va&s;t &s;tre&s;s, you &s;ee, is laid upon this duty of love, not the name, but the thing, that is to &s;ay, love as it di&s;covers it&s;elf in all proper deeds of charity. And we are herefrom taught the pertinency of the di&s;tingui&s;hing notice our Saviour takes, at the general judgment, of this kind of deeds. It cannot be thought &s;trange, that he &s;hould thus &s;in|gle them out, &s;ince they are &s;o emphatically particu|larized in the go&s;pel, and &s;poken of as nece&s;&s;ary in order to an acquittance at the bar of judgment.</P>
<P>MOREOVER, deeds of charity, &s;pringing from a principle of love, are a &s;ure proof of our being uni|ver&s;ally qualified for the rewards of God's heavenly kingdom. For our whole duty, both to God and man, is nothing but love diver&s;ified in its working.</P>
<P>WHAT is our duty to God but love varied in its actings? It is the root of all holy obedience to him, and &s;eminally comprehends it all. The apo&s;tle <HI>John</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="007869_0016_102DECCA85BF7368">
therefore ob&s;erves, 1 <HI>John</HI> v. 3. "This is the love of God, that we keep his commandments." And, if our love be real and hearty, it will expre&s;s it&s;elf in a dutiful regard to him as our King and God, in a &s;tea|dy care to ob&s;erve what&s;oever he has commanded.</P>
<P>AND the &s;ame may be &s;aid of love to our neigh|bour. It includes in it virtually all the offices of ju&s;tice and charity, and whatever duty we are obliged to, with reference to one another. So we are expre&s;ly taught by the apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> in <HI>Rom.</HI> xiii. 8. "Owe no man any thing but to love one another; for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law." It fol|lows in the two next ver&s;es, "Thou &s;halt not com|mit adultery, thou &s;halt not kill"&mdash;; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this &s;aying, namely, thou &s;halt love thy neighbour as thy &s;elf.&mdash;Therefore love is the fulfilling of the law."</P>
<P>So that where love is, that love which expre&s;&s;es it&s;elf in deeds of charity to the poor members of Chri&s;t, there no other chri&s;tian grace can be totally wanting. Our Saviour therefore, by mentioning deeds of charity, as &s;pringing from love, has done the &s;ame thing in effect, as if he had mentioned every thing el&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="007869_0017_102DECCD25895448">
IN fine, another rea&s;on, why our Saviour takes &s;uch di&s;tingui&s;hing notice of acts of charity may be, becau&s;e he looks upon every one of them as a kind|ne&s;s done to him&s;elf. And this leads me to the next thing to be di&s;cour&s;ed to from the text; and that is,</P>
<P>III. The endearing manner in which he &s;peaks of deeds of charity. "I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat; I was thir&s;ty, and ye gave me drink," and &s;o on. What is done by the righteous, in a way of charitable di&s;tributions to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed members of Chri&s;t, he graciou&s;ly &s;peaks of as done to him&s;elf. For this is the meaning of the words, as our Lord has him&s;elf explained them. For 'tis ob&s;ervable, when the great Judge of the world had &s;aid, "come, ye ble&s;&s;ed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you,&mdash;for I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat"&mdash;; The righteous, to whom he had thus ap|plied, filled with humble wonder, to find &s;uch poor and worthle&s;s &s;ervices of their's, &s;o graciou&s;ly ow<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">d and amply rewarded, break forth in the following admiring addre&s;s to their King and Judge, "Lord, when &s;aw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thir&s;ty, and gave thee drink? when &s;aw we thee a &s;tranger, and took the in"&mdash;? To which our Savi|our makes the a&s;toni&s;hing an&s;wer, in the latter part of my text, "Verily, I &s;ay unto you, ina&s;much as ye

have done it unto one of the lea&s;t of the&s;e my bre|thren, ye have done it unto me." Me indeed, in my own per&s;on, ye have not relieved, refre&s;hed, and com|forted; but the&s;e offices of charity ye have done to my brethren, to tho&s;e I am nearly related to, and ten|derly concerned for: And what ye have thus done to them, even the lea&s;t of them, I take kindly at your hands, looking upon it with the like friendly regard, as if done to my&s;elf.</P>
<P>O WONDERFUL conde&s;cen&s;ion of the Son of God, our Saviour and Judge! That he &s;hould take any no|tice of the charities of &s;uch poor, imperfect, &s;elfi&s;h creatures, de&s;erves our humble and grateful acknow|ledgments; but that he &s;hould make &s;o great account of them, e&s;teem them as &s;o many kind &s;ervices done to his own per&s;on, &s;peak of them as &s;uch openly in the face of all angels and men, and admit us here|upon to the rewards of grace in his Fathers heavenly and eternal kingdom;&mdash;it is un&s;peakably a&s;toni&s;hing! Nothing could have been &s;aid more powerfully adap|ted to convey an idea of the warmth and &s;trength of the grace of Chri&s;t towards men&punc; and we mu&s;t be lo&s;t to all &s;en&s;e of ingenuity, if our hearts are not touched with it.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="007869_0019_102DECD26C3B1EC0">
BUT that we may be led into a right under&s;tand|ing of this language of our Lord and Judge, and con|ceive aright of the propriety of his &s;aying, "ina&s;much as ye have done it to the lea&s;t of my brethren, ye have done it to me," let it be ob&s;erved,</P>
<P>THAT, as he was plea&s;ed to become a partaker of fle&s;h and blood, in fa&s;hion as a man, mankind in common are his brethren. Their relation to him as &s;uch ari&s;es from his being a man, like as we are, &s;in only excepted. And in con&s;equence of his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing manhood, he may properly be con&s;idered as, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, intere&s;ted both in the joys and &s;orrows of them, who, in common with him, partake of the &s;ame nature. He is accordingly &s;poken of, <HI>Heb.</HI> iv. 15. as "an high-prie&s;t, who could be touched with the feeling of our infirmities." What is done to us may, in a &s;en&s;e, on account of his alliance to humanity, be &s;aid to be done to him.</P>
<P>BUT there is an higher and more glorious &s;en&s;e, in which the words of our Lord may be under&s;tood. As we are chri&s;tians, not in profe&s;&s;ion, and appearance only, but in reality and truth, we are, in the moral and religious &s;en&s;e, whatever nation or kindred we are of, members of that body of which Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the head. The in&s;pired pen-men often &s;et the
<PB N="22" REF="007869_0020_102DECD4B33227C8">
matter before us in this light. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xii. 12, 13. "For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of the body, being many mem|bers, are one body: So al&s;o is Chri&s;t. For by one &s;pirit we are baptized into one body." In like man|ner, it is ob&s;erved of believers, ver. 27th, "Ye are the body of Chri&s;t, and members in particular." Now, according to the rea&s;oning, in this &s;ame chapter, 26th ver. "Whether one member &s;uffer, all the members &s;uffer with it; or one member be honored, all the members rejoice with it." And as Chri&s;t is the head of the body, the church, it is eminently true, with re&s;pect to him, that he is a &s;harer with its &s;eve|ral members in their joys and griefs. As they are parts of his body, it cannot be but he &s;hould have a tender &s;ympathy with them.</P>
<P>'TIS in allu&s;ion to this manner of &s;peaking, not in|frequently u&s;ed in &s;cripture, that what is done to the di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t, is repre&s;ented as done to him&s;elf. In this point of light, we are, at once, let into the meaning of that &s;urprizing voice from heaven, <HI>Acts</HI> ix. 4, 5. "Saul, Saul, why per&s;ecute&s;t thou me?&mdash;I am Je&s;us whom thou per&s;ecute&s;t." In the &s;ame light, we may readily &s;ee the propriety, and force, of that remarkable pa&s;&s;age, in the go&s;pel, "Who&s;oever &s;hall give to drink unto one of the&s;e little ones, a cup
<PB N="23" REF="007869_0021_102DECD65FB36310">
of cold water only in the name of a di&s;ciple, verily I &s;ay unto you, he &s;hall in no wi&s;e lo&s;e his reward." And 'tis with a view to the &s;ame con&s;ideration of good men as the body of Chri&s;t, that he &s;ays, "I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat; I was thir&s;ty, and ye gave me drink."&mdash;And again, "Verily I &s;ay unto you, ina&s;much as ye have done it to the lea&s;t of the&s;e my brethren, ye have done it unto me."</P>
<P>HAVING, with as much brevity as I could, gone over the &s;everal particulars propo&s;ed to be con&s;idered, there is time to turn the di&s;cour&s;e into a &s;erious exhortation, calling upon my &s;elf and you to abound in deeds of charity. Nor can the wi&s;dom of men or angels pre&s;ent to our view, for our quickning and encouragement, &s;tronger arguments than tho&s;e con|tained in my text. Our Saviour and Judge will ac|cept it kindly of us, if we open our hearts at the cry of his needy di&s;ciples, and &s;tretch forth our hands to their relief. Yea, he will reckon it an act of bene|ficence done to him&s;elf, and acknowledge it as &s;uch before the general a&s;&s;embly at the great day. And can we with&s;tand &s;o moving, &s;o endearing, a con&s;ide|ration? Where, in that ca&s;e, is our love to the Sa|viour, our be&s;t friend, and greate&s;t benefactor? Was our dear Lord now on earth, and could we behold him, with our bodily eyes, in a &s;uffering &s;tate, as he once was, &s;hould we think any thing too much to
<PB N="24" REF="007869_0022_102DECDAA8865BF0">
part with for his comfort? Let us make it appear, that we &s;hould not, by mini&s;tring to the nece&s;&s;ities of poor &s;aints. In this way, we may now mini&s;ter even to Chri&s;t him&s;elf. For he is the head of that body, of which believers, however poor and needy, are parts; and the kindne&s;s we &s;how them, we &s;how it con&s;tructively to him: Yea, there is no office of love we can expre&s;s towards them, even the meane&s;t of them, but our Lord will take it as though per&s;onally done to him&s;elf. O the a&s;toni&s;hing &s;tupidity of tho&s;e men, who are not made willing, by this con&s;training motive, to do good, as they have opportunity, and ability, to the hou&s;hold of faith!</P>
<P>IF this &s;hould be the truth with re&s;pect to any of us, let us look forward to the coming day of judg|ment, and know, that our admi&s;&s;ion to the rewards of an eternal kingdom is e&s;&s;entially connected with that "love to the brethren," which will &s;how it &s;elf in all &s;uitable in&s;tances of beneficence towards them. The inquiry, at the judgment, will be, what have been our charities, in obedience to the go&s;pel? What di&s;ttributions have we made to Chri&s;t's poor, which we have always had with us to move our commi&s;era|tion? Nor will it be in our power to give a good ac|count of our&s;elves, if we cannot &s;ay, that we have fed the hungry, and cloathed the naked, in &s;ome pro|portion
<PB N="25" REF="007869_0023_102DECDC58D4FEA0">
according to the ability God has given us. It will not then avail us, tho' we &s;hould have done no hurt, if we have done no good. It will not then &s;uffice, that we have been fair and hone&s;t in our dealings, that we have been &s;ober and temperate in our enjoyments, or that we have appeared zealous and devout towards God, if, at the &s;ame time, we have been heard-hear|ted and uncharitable; if, while we have had it by us, we have &s;aid to our poor neighbour, "go, and come again to morrow, and I will give thee"; if, while we have had ability, we have &s;aid to this and the other "brother and &s;i&s;ter, when naked, or de&s;titute of daily food, depart in peace, be ye warmed, be ye filled, and have not given them tho&s;e things which are needful for the body."</P>
<P>IT may be worthy of our particular notice, and mo&s;t &s;olemn remembrance, that the dreadful cur&s;e &s;poken of, in the context, as denounced again&s;t the wicked, is grounded on their neglect of deeds of cha|rity. "Depart from me ye cur&s;ed; for I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat; I was thir&s;ty, and ye gave me no drink," and &s;o on. They were, no doubt, &s;inners in other re&s;pects; [the want of charity is commonly accompanied with many other &s;ins] but their uncharitablene&s;s only is mentioned by name; and 'tis on this account, in &s;pecial, that they are doomed to "the fire prepared for the devil and his angels."</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="007869_0024_102DECDE790DD5C0">
Do we, my brethren, believe a coming day of judgment? Do we expect to &s;ee the Son of man de|&s;cending from heaven, in great glory, with his holy angels, to &s;ummon both quick and dead to an appear|ance before his tribunal? Let us prove our faith by our works. "To do good and communicate, let us not forget; for with &s;uch &s;acrifices God is well plea|&s;ed." Do we hope to be found at the right hand of our Judge, when he &s;hall "appear a &s;econd time without &s;in unto &s;alvation"? Let us then be "rich in good works, ready to di&s;tribute, willing to com|municate": So &s;hall we "lay up in &s;tore for our &s;elves a good foundation again&s;t that time, and &s;hall lay hold on eternal life."</P>
<P>THE ble&s;&s;ed &s;entence, we have heard, will, at the judgment-day, be pronounced on tho&s;e, and only tho&s;e, who have "fed the hungry, and cloathed the naked." If therefore we have not, when God has given us ability and opportunity, done the&s;e kind offices to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed in Chri&s;t, and are con&s;cious to our &s;elves that we have been thus uncharitable, we can be at no lo&s;s to determine, that we are not in the number of tho&s;e, concerning whom the great King and Judge of the world will &s;ay, at his appear|ing, "come, ye ble&s;&s;ed of my father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you, from the foundation of the world."</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="007869_0025_102DC734A5FEE9D8">
SURELY, if we had faith in a judgment to come, and did but realize the advantage, the un&s;peakable and everla&s;ting advantage, it would then be to us, to have abounded in deeds of charity, we &s;hould not be di&s;po&s;ed to "with-hold more than is meet," as we too commonly are. 'Tis a certain truth, however backward we may be to admit it, that the be&s;t thing we can do with "the mammon of unrighteou&s;|ne&s;s" is, to "make to our&s;elves friends of it," by employing it to the u&s;es of charity, that "when we &s;ail, they may receive us to everla&s;ting habitations." We are hardly brought to believe it, but 'tis a go&s;pel truth, that we then mo&s;t con&s;ult our own intere&s;t, when we do the mo&s;t good with our e&s;tates. We may, in this way con&s;tructively remit them to another world, where we may enjoy the benefit of them forever. Every deed of charity, &s;pringing from a principle of faith in Chri&s;t, and love to God and our neighbour, is as &s;o much trea&s;ure laid up in heaven. We may be ready to think, all that is done this way is lo&s;t, e&s;teeming it as "bread ca&s;t upon the waters." as the wi&s;e man &s;peaks; but we &s;hall "find it again after many days: perhaps, in this world, without a po&s;&s;ibility of failure in the coming eternal world. The lea&s;t good we do to the lea&s;t di&s;ciple of Chri&s;t, done in faith and love, &s;hall be remembred, and taken notice of, by him at the judgment, and amply rewarded. And the more good we do, the more di&s;tingui&s;hingly glorious will
<PB N="28" REF="007869_0026_102DECE39E77B690">
the &s;entence of our Judge be, when he bids us "enter into the joys of our Lord."</P>
<P>SOME, perhaps, may be ready to find fault with me for not bringing a di&s;cour&s;e better fitted to the de|&s;igns of a communion-day. But it ought to be re|membred, our being hereafter admitted to &s;et down at the eternal &s;upper of the Lamb, in God's heavenly kingdom, is connected, in the text I have been upon, even by our Saviour him&s;elf, with the regard we have paid to that duty of charity I have been recommending.</P>
<P>AND 'tis ob&s;ervable, that very death, which we commemorate, at the holy &s;upper, was owing to cha|rity in the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us to the peri&s;hing &s;ons of men, greater charity than was ever before expre&s;&s;ed in this world of our's, or ever will be expre&s;&s;ed again. And the &s;upper, at which we are about to communicate, is an appointed memorial of this very charity of our Saviour and Lord: Nor can we &s;uitably remember his death, without remembring that charity of his, which made him willing to undergo this death for our eternal good.</P>
<P>AND 'tis, moreover, a fea&s;t of charity that we are about to attend. And if we would attend it aright, it mu&s;t be in the exerci&s;e of that charity, which will in|fluence us to "love one another, even as Chri&s;t loved us," when he "gave him&s;elf an offering for our &s;ins."</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="007869_0027_102DECE66D34B160">
BESIDES all which, the &s;ubject I have been upon is, at this time, the more &s;ea&s;onable, as, in the provi|dence of God, there is an opportunity, and a fair call, to pre&s;ent to your view an illu&s;trious in&s;tance of one of tho&s;e righteous ones, of who&s;e deeds of charity to the poor, we have rea&s;on to believe, our Redeemer will take particular notice, at the great day of judgment, and publi&s;h to the general a&s;&s;embly of angels and men to his eternal honor.</P>
<P>YOUR thoughts, I doubt not, are at once fixed on that dear brother of our's, and friend of Chri&s;t and the poor, who departed this life ye&s;terday Morn|ing.</P>
<P>WHAT is &s;aid upon &s;uch occa&s;ions is &s;ometimes apt to give di&s;gu&s;t, as being e&s;teemed a compliment to the dead, rather than their ju&s;t character. But, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, I am in no fear of giving offence, the per&s;on I am to &s;peak of was &s;o unexceptionable, &s;o unenvied unle&s;s for his goodne&s;s, and &s;o univer|&s;ally well &s;poken of, both while living, and now he is dead.</P>
<P>IT was his glory and happine&s;s, that he began early to &s;eek and &s;erve God; and he made good progre&s;s in religion, exemplifying in his temper, and conduct, the things that were virtuous and prai&s;e|worthy.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="007869_0028_102DECE81F070DE0">
HE had upon his mind an habitual awe and rever|ence of the great God; was a man of undi&s;&s;embled piety; prayerful and devout; con&s;cientious in his ob|&s;ervation of the Lord's day; a con&s;tant &s;erious at|tendant on all the in&s;titutions of go&s;pel-wor&s;hip; a bright pattern of meekne&s;s and humility, patience and &s;ubjection to the Father of &s;pirits; remarkable for his regard to ju&s;tice, which he ever di&s;covered in the fair|ne&s;s in his dealings, punctual veracity to his word; for his uprightne&s;s and integrity; his generous and public &s;pirit; his plain-heartedne&s;s and &s;implicity; his free|dom from deceit and guile; his di&s;regard to the pomps and vanities of the world; his peaceable, inoffen&s;ive and kind carriage towards all men.</P>
<P>HE was of an active &s;pirit, diligent in bu&s;ine&s;s; but did not pur&s;ue it to the neglect of the one thing need|ful. His &s;hare of this world's goods, the fruit of his own labour, under the divine ble&s;&s;ing, was very con|&s;iderable; but he did not keep it to him&s;elf. He "honored the Lord with his &s;ub&s;tance"; chearfully embracing the opportunities providence put into his hands of relieving the nece&s;&s;ities of the poor. He was "rich in good works, ready to di&s;tribute, willing to communicate": Tho' how often he did &s;o is not fully known, nor will it be known, till the day of the re|velation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. And what added much to the beauty and value of his charities, he di&s;pen&s;ed them

without noi&s;e and bu&s;tle, without &s;hew or o&s;tentation; not &s;eeking, not regarding, the prai&s;e of men, and con|cerned chiefly to approve him&s;elf to his great Lord and Judge. He was, in a word, one of tho&s;e "good men for whom (as the apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> &s;peaks) one would even dare to die." He "gave much alms to the people," and they went up "for a memorial before God."</P>
<P>HE was, as might be expected of &s;uch a man, re|conciled to the thoughts of death, willing to be "ab|&s;ent from the body," as hoping he &s;hould go to "be with Chri&s;t, which is be&s;t of all.

In&s;tead of the fathers, may there be the children, to &s;upply their place, and continue this church to the &s;econd coming of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t!</P>
