<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IT may be &s;uppo&s;ed by many, that the following pub|lication needs an apology: the author is &s;en&s;ible of it, and offers, as &s;uch, the rea&s;ons which he gives, in the beginning of the &s;ubject, for entering upon it.</P>
<P>He is not fond of religious controver&s;y; but there are times when a mini&s;ter of religion may feel it nece&s;&s;ary to bear his te&s;timony, feeble as it may be, again&s;t errors, which, in his view, teem with the mo&s;t pernicious con&s;e|quences to the intere&s;ts of real piety, and the welfare of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Such a time the author e&s;teems the pre&s;ent to be. Alarmed at the progre&s;s of the errors which the following Sermons are de&s;igned to refute, and at the patronage af|forded them by &s;ome di&s;tingui&s;hed characters in our the|ological world, he was willing to contribute his mite to the cau&s;e of truth, and to hazard his name and (&s;ome may think) his reputation as a writer, in the &s;upport of it.</P>
<P>He hath treated the &s;ubject in a general and diffu&s;ive manner, with the de&s;ign, that it may be under&s;tood by all. He hath treated it practically; for it is, or ought to be, the end of every di&s;cour&s;e, to make men not only wi&s;er, but better. If he can e&s;tabli&s;h the wavering mind of one &s;erious Chri&s;tian; if he can arou&s;e one carele&s;s &s;inner to a &s;en&s;e of his danger, he will e&s;teem it a rich reward for all his trouble, and a better recompence than the highe&s;t re|putation as a polemical writer.</P>
<P>He is not con&s;cious to him&s;elf of feeling any bitterne&s;s again&s;t tho&s;e who think differently from him. Though he

con&s;iders them as mi&s;taken, yet he hopes them to be good men, and influenced by the dictates of their con&s;ciences. Perhaps there may &s;ome warm expre&s;&s;ions have e&s;caped him, in the cour&s;e of the argument; they are not meant for the men, but for the doctrine which they a&s;&s;ert and patronize.</P>
<P>The unanimous de&s;ire of tho&s;e who heard them, and the opinion of &s;uch as have read them in manu&s;cript, have led to the publication of the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es.</P>

<HEAD>THREE SERMONS, PREACHED AT MALDEN, OCTOBER, 1782.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>ISAIAH lxvi. 24.</HI></BIBL>
<P>AND they &s;hall go forth, and look upon the carca&s;es of the men that have tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed again&s;t me: far their worm &s;hall not die, neither &s;hall their fire be quenched: and they &s;hall be an abhorring unto all fle&s;h.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS remarkable denunciation of divine vengeance concludes the prophecy of the princely I&s;aiah. He had the cleare&s;t views of any of the prophets, of the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation; he delivered the promi&s;es and encouragements of the covenant of grace to believers in &s;triking, and animating language, and at the &s;ame time denounced the judgments of Heaven again&s;t all <HI>the work|ers of iniquity.</HI></P>
<P>The chapter whence our text is taken, contains both promi&s;es and threatenings; for it evidently refers to the days when all men, then upon the face of the earth, &s;hall be made acquainted with the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, and &s;ubmit truly unto it. And the&s;e &s;hall know the mi&s;ery of the men who, in times pa&s;t, have rejected the coun&s;el of God again&s;t them&s;elves: they &s;hall be made acquainted with this, to excite their gratitude to the great God, for &s;aving them from &s;uch a ruin, to keep up a lively view of the infinite evil of &s;in in their minds, and perhaps to be a
<PB N="8" REF="018207_0006_0FA5BC45B9226B48">
means of pre&s;erving their integrity, and preventing them from de&s;iring to return unto folly.</P>
<P>That the prophet was &s;peaking in the text of the future puni&s;hment of the wicked, a puni&s;hment which &s;hould take place in a &s;tate different from the pre&s;ent, is evident by the quotation which our Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t made of this very pa&s;&s;age, Mark ix. 43, 44. <HI>And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off; it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never &s;hall be quenched: where their worm dieth not, and their fire is not quenched.</HI></P>
<P>The text is metaphorical, and points out the future, endle&s;s mi&s;ery of the impenitent, by the de&s;truction which cometh upon the carca&s;es of tho&s;e who fall in battle, and are left unburied. The &s;aints &s;hall behold the mi&s;ery, and ruin of tho&s;e who die in their &s;ins, as we behold, with a gloomy melancholy, the unburied carca&s;es which cover a field of battle. The accu&s;ations of their con&s;ciences &s;hall be to the wicked as a worm which gnaws without cea&s;ing, and as a fire which no art, nor force can quench; their moral character &s;hall be &s;uch as to render them an abhor|rence to all tho&s;e who love, and delight in that which is good, in the &s;ame manner as a corp&s;e, which is covered with filth, and infe&s;ted with worms, is di&s;agreeable, and abhorrent to tho&s;e who behold it.</P>
<P>Thus is the mi&s;ery of the finally impenitent repre&s;ented by the text, in language metaphorical, it is true, but adapted to the de&s;ign of the prophet, and elegantly ex|pre&s;&s;ive of his meaning. <HI>The worm that dieth not, the fire that &s;hall not be quenched,</HI> pre&s;ent us with a grand, but alarming idea, of the future &s;tate of the impenitent &s;inner.</P>
<P>That there &s;hall be a &s;tate of puni&s;hment for the wicked beyond the grave, &s;carce any believer in revelation will doubt. But many &s;cruple whether this puni&s;hment &s;hall be eternal in its duration; they &s;uppo&s;e that it &s;hall la&s;t only for a limited time, and then, that all things, and all men &s;hall be re&s;tored to a &s;tate of happine&s;s. Many indulge to the&s;e &s;cruples at the pre&s;ent day. The doctrine of the eternal puni&s;hment of the wicked is openly attacked. Many, and tho&s;e men of eminence (and, we would hope, of virtue and goodne&s;s too,) patronize the oppo&s;ers of
<PB N="9" REF="018207_0007_0FA5BC460A85F458">
this doctrines and this con&s;ideration hath led me to make choice of the pre&s;ent &s;ubject.</P>
<P>This choice needs no apology. The doctrine before us is important, and intere&s;ting to every individual of us. If we are rational and accountable creatures; if we are made for immortality, and mu&s;t be happy or mi&s;erable, through|out eternity, as we are righteous or wicked here, it be|comes us to know it; for the knowledge, one would think, mu&s;t have a powerful effect upon our conduct.</P>
<P>The mini&s;ters of religion <HI>are &s;et for the defence of the go&s;pel.</HI> They are not at liberty to permit their private feel|ings, or their worldly intere&s;t, to re&s;train them from de|livering <HI>the whole coun&s;el of God.</HI> However di&s;agreeable their &s;entiments may be, to the pride or corruption of the human heart: however painful it may be to them to deliver truths, which will occa&s;ion unea&s;ine&s;s, and terror to their hearers; yet they mu&s;t <HI>&s;et their faces as flints</HI>; they mu&s;t re&s;olutely determine to deliver every part of divine truth, let it plea&s;e, or di&s;plea&s;e whom it may.</P>
<P>It hath been ob&s;erved, that men's principles in religion, were often formed by their natural di&s;po&s;ition and habit; and that the doctrine of eternal puni&s;hment, was the pro|duct of a dark and gloomy mind. But that mind mu&s;t be gloomy and malevolent indeed, which can delight in cau&s;|ing needle&s;s terror to its fellow creatures: and the di&s;po&s;i|tion mu&s;t be truly diabolical, which can take plea&s;ure in reflecting upon human mi&s;ery, capriciou&s;ly or unju&s;tly in|flicted. But if this doctrine is really true, it is a part of the warme&s;t benevolence, and true&s;t friend&s;hip, to warn men of their danger, and caution them to avoid it. What influence my natural temper may have upon my creed, I determine not; but this I know, that I believe fully, from the word of God, that tho&s;e mu&s;t be eternally mi&s;erable, who die in their &s;ins. And therefore I feel, that I am per|forming an act of the true&s;t kindne&s;s, when I am endea|vouring to convince you of this truth, and urging you to flee from the wrath to come.</P>
<P>The de&s;ign of this, and &s;ome following di&s;cour&s;es, is to &s;hew,</P>
<P>DOCT.] <HI>That the puni&s;hment of the finally impenitent, (meaning tho&s;e who die &s;o) will be eternal in its duration; or, that all nun &s;hall not be finally &s;aved.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="018207_0008_0FA5BC46949F6F28">Tho&s;e propo&s;itions are &s;o clo&s;ely connected with each other, as that the proof of one, nece&s;&s;arily confirms and e&s;tabli&s;hes the other. We mu&s;t be excu&s;ed, therefore, for blending them together.</P>
<P>The doctrine before us, we will endeavour, fir&s;t, to prove from &s;cripture: and then we will an&s;wer, and attempt to invalidate, the objections and arguments of its oppo&s;ers.</P>
<P>And here, we are ready to acknowledge, that this doc|trine depends entirely upon the te&s;timony of revelation. We know little of the eternal world, of the nature or ex|tent of our exi&s;tence there, by the light of rea&s;on, <HI>Life and immortality are brought to light by the go&s;pel.</HI> We are indebted to revelation for the mo&s;t which we know, concerning the invi&s;ible world, and tho&s;e who do now, or &s;hall hereafter, inhabit it. We are content, therefore, to wave the te&s;ti|mony of the heathen writers; to omit the opinions of their philo&s;ophers, upon the immortality of the &s;oul; and to lay a&s;ide their de&s;criptions of Ely&s;ium and Tartarus, which might po&s;&s;ibly tend to prove, that they had an idea of the eternal happine&s;s of the good, and the eternal mi&s;ery of the wicked, in the future-world. But the&s;e te&s;timonies would weigh but little; they are merely the effects of tradition, tran&s;mitted in a manner &s;ufficiently dark and doubtful. We are much &s;afer when we attend to the dic|tates of revelation. Here we may re&s;t, with the utmo&s;t &s;ecurity. We know this will not deceive us.</P>
<P N="1">I. Our fir&s;t argument, to prove the doctrine we advance, is taken from the very great difference, which is made in the word of God, between the character, and end of the righteous and the wicked.</P>
<P>It is mo&s;t certain, that, in every part of the word of God, there is a very plain, and expre&s;s di&s;tinction, kept up between &s;aints and &s;inners. The one are repre&s;ented, as di|rectly oppo&s;ite to the other, in di&s;po&s;ition, in manners in character and end. The one are &s;tyled <HI>children of God:</HI> the other are repre&s;ented as <HI>children of the evil one, at children of wrath, a generation of vipers,</HI> and the like. There is &s;uch a difference, in the character and &s;tate of the righteous and the wicked, as that the latter are told, that they mu&s;t pa&s;s through a change, great as a natural birth, before they can be numbered with the former. <HI>Except a man be born
<PB N="11" REF="018207_0009_0FA5BC475B280E90">
again,</HI> &s;aith our Saviour, Joh. iii. 3. <HI>he cannot &s;ee the king|dom of God.</HI> The &s;aints of God are &s;tyled his <HI>workman&s;hip, created in Chri&s;t Je&s;us unto holine&s;s and good works.</HI> It is &s;aid, that <HI>neither circumci&s;ion availeth any thing, nor uncircum|ci&s;ion, but the new creature.</HI> And good men are &s;aid to be <HI>born, not of blood, nor of the will of the fle&s;h, nor of the will of man, but of God.</HI></P>
<P>It is true, that regeneration is a metaphorical term; but &s;till it means <HI>&s;omething,</HI> and tends to convey an idea &s;ome|what &s;imilar to that from which it is taken. The expre&s;|&s;ions we have but now quoted, mu&s;t (if they mean any thing) &s;erve to convey as much as this; that when men are brought to leave their &s;ins, and turn to God, or, in &s;crip|ture language, are regenerated, the moral frame, and di&s;|po&s;ition of their minds, are totally changed; their views of things become e&s;&s;entially different from what they were, and their conduct and behaviour are altered in con&s;equence. It &s;eems as if a metaphor, taken from a change &s;o great as that, from non-exi&s;tence to exi&s;tence, could not convey le&s;s than this.</P>
<P>This change mu&s;t pa&s;s upon men, while they are in a &s;tate of probation, while they are under the influence of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions and affections, which, we have rea&s;on to think, are peculiar to the pre&s;ent &s;tate of exi&s;tence. The &s;cripture every where repre&s;ents, the change made upon us by death, as e&s;&s;entially altering our &s;ituation, with re&s;pect to the things of eternity, and the concerns of our &s;ouls. The effects of this regeneration, are works of piety, charity and kindne&s;s, adapted to the pre&s;ent &s;tate of mankind only. Which things prove, that the idea of a regeneration, beyond the grave, is ridiculous in it&s;elf; and could be pro|duced, only by the nece&s;&s;ity of getting rid of a powerful argument, which militated with a darling &s;cheme.</P>
<P>The de&s;ign and intention of the go&s;pel mini&s;try is &s;aid, Acts xxvi. 18. to be, <HI>to open men's eyes, and to turn them from darkne&s;s to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgivene&s;s of &s;ins.</HI> Surely the apo&s;tle mu&s;t here intend &s;omething important! He mu&s;t mean to convey, that there is a very great alteration made, not only in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of men's minds, by the go&s;pel, but al&s;o in their conditi|on with re&s;pect to eternity. It cannot be imagined that tho&s;e
<PB N="12" REF="018207_0010_0FA5BC4815026718">
who have experienced the effects of the go&s;pel, mentioned in this text, are, or will be ever, in the &s;ame &s;ituation with tho&s;e, who are under the influence of darkne&s;s, and are in a &s;tate of death. But if all men are &s;aved, they will be as truly, and as eternally happy, as any who &s;ubmit to the go&s;pel, and experience its transforming efficacy. The doctrine we are combating, then, hath a tendency to lead men to di&s;regard the go&s;pel, and to prevent their being &s;o influenced by it, as to partake of its ble&s;&s;ings.</P>
<P>The righteous and the wicked are &s;aid to be treated differently by God in this world. The fir&s;t are promi&s;ed the light of his countenance, and communion and fellow&s;hip with him. It is engaged to them, that <HI>all things &s;hall work together for their good;</HI> and they are &s;aid to <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;s all things:</HI> while it is declared, that <HI>there is no peace to the wicked</HI>&mdash;that <HI>they are poor and mi&s;erable, blind and naked.</HI> And a denun|ciation like this, is pronounced again&s;t them, Mal. ii. 2. <HI>If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay it to heart, to give glory unto my name, &s;aith the Lord of ho&s;ts, I will even &s;end a cur&s;e upon you; and I will cur&s;e your ble&s;&s;ings; yea, I have cur&s;ed them already, becau&s;e ye do not lay it to heart.</HI></P>
<P>The deaths of the righteous and wicked are repre&s;ented, as e&s;&s;entially different: <HI>the wicked is driven away in his wickedne&s;s; but the righteous hath hope in his death.</HI> In the parable of the rich man and Lazarus, Luke xvi. the beg|gar is &s;aid to have died, and to be carried by the angels into Abraham's bo&s;om. The rich man al&s;o, we are told, died, and was buried; <HI>and in hell,</HI> goes on the hi&s;tory, <HI>he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and &s;eeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bo&s;om.</HI> The death of the &s;aints is de|clared, to be precious in the &s;ight of the Lord; while the wicked are repre&s;ented, as dying under his wrath and cur&s;e, and expo&s;ed to his everla&s;ting di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, there is, through the whole of the word of God, a plain, and evident di&s;tinction made between the character, the &s;ituation, and circum&s;tances of good and bad men. There are marks, and &s;ignatures pointed out to us, in the &s;criptures, by which we are to judge, whether we hear the one, or the other character. We are pre&s;&s;ed ear|ne&s;tly, to examine our&s;elves as to this point; and are cau|tioned again&s;t deception. We are moreover a&s;&s;ured, that
<PB N="13" REF="018207_0011_0FA5BC48E3FE8210">
this di&s;tinction &s;hall be kept up in the future, as well as the pre&s;ent world, in Mal. iii. 18. <HI>Then &s;hall ye return, and di&s;cern between the righteous and the wicked; between him that &s;erveth God, and him that &s;erveth him not.</HI> An examination of the context, will convince every man, that this declara|tion refers to the day of judgment; repre&s;ented there, as <HI>the day when God makes up his jewels,</HI> and as <HI>the day that &s;hall burn as an oven.</HI></P>
<P>Now, my brethren, why is all this di&s;tinction made? Why are the characters, the &s;tate, and the ends, of good and bad men, repre&s;ented as &s;o entirely different, if there is a time coming, when they &s;hall both &s;tand upon the &s;ame footing, and both be equally acceptable to God, and happy in the enjoyment of him? Why is all this parade, in the word of God, concerning the nece&s;&s;ity of a change of heart, the importance of faith, and the indi&s;pen&s;able ne|ce&s;&s;ity of holine&s;s, in order to our &s;eeing God in happi|ne&s;s, if we are all to do &s;o, &s;ooner or later, let us be ever &s;o unholy, or unbelieving? Why are eternal life, and happi|ne&s;s, promi&s;ed only to men, of a certain character, if men of all characters are finally to partake of them? Why is it &s;aid, <HI>without holine&s;s no man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord,</HI> if we &s;hall all &s;ee him, &s;ooner or later, whether we are holy or no? Why is it &s;aid, with &s;o much &s;olemnity, 1 Cor. vi. 9, 10. <HI>Know ye not, that the unrighteous &s;hall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived, neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abu&s;ers of them&s;elves with man|kind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, &s;hall inherit the kingdom of God!</HI> Why is this declaration made, I &s;ay, if men of the&s;e characters, be they ever &s;o vicious, though they may live and die in the love and con&s;tant, allowed, deliberate practice of every one of the&s;e vices, &s;hall finally enter the kingdom of hea|ven? If the man, who wallows in blood, who breaks through every &s;ocial, and moral obligation; who prevents and de&s;troys the happine&s;s of millions; who wantons in the mi&s;ery and wretchedne&s;s of whole nations, and commu|nities of men: if this man, living and dying under the in|fluence, and government of the&s;e ferocious pa&s;&s;ions, is to be finally happy, and glorious to all eternity, what need is there of &s;elf-denial, and mortification? Why need we give
<PB N="14" REF="018207_0012_0FA5BC49988B8DD8">
diligence to make our calling and election &s;ure? Why &s;hould we &s;tudy, and take pains to be &s;aints, and conformed to the image of God? Surely, this is labour lo&s;t, and good men are in this life mo&s;t mi&s;erable!</P>
<P>If the time is to come, when all men &s;hall be admitted to the divine favour and happine&s;s; then, &s;urely, the di&s;|tinction, which is &s;o carefully made in the &s;criptures of God, between good and bad men, is nugatory and vain! We need take no pains to become Chri&s;tians, or to live and walk as they are directed to do. We may as well gratify our pa&s;&s;ions and appetites, as not do &s;o; for throughout eter|nity, it will be the &s;ame thing to us, every di&s;tinction &s;hall be levelled, and we &s;hall all be happy alike! Perhaps there cannot be conclu&s;ions, more natural in them&s;elves, or which will be more univer&s;ally drawn by mankind, from the doc|trine we are oppo&s;ing, than the&s;e. And can there be con|clu&s;ions, more fatal to the intere&s;ts of virtue and holine&s;s, or more pernicious to human &s;ociety? To what purpo&s;e tend exhortations to &s;aints, or alarms to &s;inners, if they are to meet at la&s;t, without di&s;tinction, in the &s;ame happy world? And what is there to prevent a believer in the doctrine of univer&s;al redemption, from committing any crime, which his intere&s;t, or his pa&s;&s;ions may dictate, if he can e&s;cape pre&s;ent &s;hame and puni&s;hment?</P>
<P>Brethren, &s;olemnly would I caution, and warn you all, as you expect to an&s;wer it another day, to remember, that the word of God makes a very great di&s;tinction, between the righteous and the wicked: that the one are to be happy, while the other are to be mi&s;erable: that it is, in this word, repre&s;ented, as above all things nece&s;&s;ary, to be believers in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and to be &s;anctified by his holy &s;pirit. Do not let any thing, any &s;entiment or doctrine, dimini&s;h your concern about <HI>the one thing that is needful</HI>; for the hour is ha&s;tening, when we &s;hall every one find, that we could never take too much pains, nor be&s;tow too much &s;olicitude, upon the &s;alvation of our immortal &s;ouls.</P>
<P N="2">II. A &s;econd argument, to prove that the duration of the puni&s;hment of the impenitent, in the other world, &s;hall be eternal; or that all men are not &s;aved, ari&s;es from the na|ture of &s;in. However light &s;ome may e&s;teem this, yet we are taught, by the word of God, to view it as an evil and a

bitter thing under the &s;un. It is there &s;poken of, in terms adapted to convey to us, the mo&s;t formidable ideas of it; and in its con&s;equences, it is &s;aid <HI>to bite like a &s;erpent, and &s;ting like an adder.</HI></P>
<P>It is right for us to judge of the nature of an offence, from the dignity, &s;ituation, and circum&s;tances of the per|&s;on, again&s;t whom it is committed; and from the obligations, of the per&s;on committing it, to a contrary cour&s;e of con|duct. We cannot arrive at a preci&s;e idea of the nature of an offence, without taking the&s;e into view; for they have an intimate connection and relation. An offence of a &s;er|vant again&s;t his ma&s;ter, of a &s;ubject again&s;t his king, is greater than the offence of either of them again&s;t an equal.</P>
<P>Sin is an offence committed again&s;t an infinite autho|rity, for it is a violation of the laws of an infinite God. He hath guarded the injunctions of his law, and the pre|cepts of his go&s;pel, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> no le&s;s a &s;anction, than the whole weight of his infinite authority. This every &s;inner knows. But notwith&s;tanding this knowledge, he goes directly in the face of this infinite authority. He commits &s;in, though the infinite, and eternal Jehovah forbids it.</P>
<P>The &s;inner is under the highe&s;t obligations to a contrary cour&s;e of conduct. God is his creator, pre&s;erver, and be|nefactor. He hath the mo&s;t powerful motives &s;et before him, to excite him to his duty, and re&s;train him from &s;in. God is daily increa&s;ing the number of his benefits to him. But notwith&s;tanding all this; notwith&s;tanding all his light, knowledge, and advantages, he doth that which is entirely wrong&mdash;he may ju&s;tly be charged, then, with an infinite offence.</P>
<P>An infinite offence, merits an infinite puni&s;hment. But man is a finite creature, he cannot be puni&s;hed by a ven|geance infinite in its nature. His puni&s;hment, therefore, mu&s;t be eternal in its duration, in order to its being ade|quate to the offence: and thus we &s;hall find, that the &s;crip|tures of God repre&s;ent it.</P>
<P>There is no one thing, which all the declarations, pro|mi&s;es, and threatenings of the word of God, hath a more direct tendency to &s;hew us, than that God views &s;in as a mo&s;t pernicious evil; that it is directly contrary to his na|ture, which is holine&s;s it&s;elf; and hath the mo&s;t pernicious
<PB N="16" REF="018207_0014_0FA5BC4B2DCE2A70">
effects upon human happine&s;s. The &s;criptures &s;peak of it, as <HI>a great and horrible evil, as exceeding &s;inful,</HI> as <HI>that which God's &s;oul hateth, that which &s;eparateth between God and man,</HI> and <HI>that again&s;t which his wrath is revealed.</HI></P>
<P>The word of God leads us to view &s;in, as the cau&s;e of the death of Chri&s;t, and as that which produces every ca|lamity to which mankind are &s;ubject. We are warned again&s;t it, as our bane. We have every motive, and induce|ment &s;et before us, to re&s;train us from it; and are directed to make u&s;e of every occurrence in providence, as a motive <HI>to take away &s;in.</HI> Every page of divine revelation furni&s;hes more or le&s;s arguments, to re&s;train us from iniquity.</P>
<P>So directly contrary is &s;in repre&s;ented to be to the pure nature of the divinity, and &s;o &s;ubver&s;ive of human happine&s;s, as that without repentance of it, and turning from it, we are expre&s;sly told, that we &s;hall not enjoy the mercy of God. We read, Prov. xx<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> 13. <HI>He that covereth his &s;ins, &s;hall not pro&s;per: but who&s;o confe&s;&s;eth and for&s;aketh them, &s;hall have mercy.</HI> Without repentance of &s;in, which includes for&s;aking it, we are told, that we &s;hall not enjoy eternal life. <HI>Except ye repent,</HI> &s;aith our Lord, Luke xiii. 3. <HI>ye &s;hall all likewi&s;e peri&s;h.</HI> At the &s;ame time that we are called upon to believe the go&s;pel, Mark i. 15. we are di|rected to repent, which proves, that this is equally nece&s;|&s;ary to &s;alvation, with faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>How un&s;criptural mu&s;t that doctrine be, then, which tells us, that how many &s;oever infinite offences again&s;t God we may be guilty of, and how long or ob&s;tinately &s;oever we may per&s;i&s;t in them; though we may live di&s;obeying the divine authority, and die bla&s;pheming, and cur&s;ing the name, the nature, and the works of the great and dreadful God; per&s;i&s;ting in our hatred and oppo&s;ition to him; yet we &s;hall be happy at la&s;t: yea, that the time will come, when we &s;hall be as really, and truly glorious and happy, as tho&s;e who have been ever &s;o penitent for their offences again&s;t God, and ever &s;o de&s;irous of conformity to him! Is that doctrine agreeable to &s;cripture, which &s;aith, that whether a man repents and for&s;akes &s;in or no, yet he &s;hall be happy at la&s;t? Is it not, on the contrary, reprobated by every page of the go&s;pel?</P>
<P>It is mo&s;t certain, that our partiality in our own favour,
<PB N="17" REF="018207_0015_0FA5BC4C006C5A48">
renders us apt to excu&s;e, and ju&s;tify our&s;elves. Our crimes do not appear &s;o heinous to us, as they are in them&s;elves; neither do we think that they de&s;erve a very heavy pu|ni&s;hment. Let a man, who hath been guilty of the mo&s;t capital and atrocious crime, judge of the puni&s;hment which ought to be inflicted upon him, and we know that it will not be very heavy. Our partiality in our own favour, leads us to &s;uppo&s;e, that we cannot de&s;erve any great &s;uffering, for &s;uch trifling offences, as natural men are ready to e&s;teem their &s;ins to be. We ought always to take this thought into view, when we are judging upon our&s;elves, and en|deavouring to find the light in which we &s;tand, with re|&s;pect to our Maker.</P>
<P N="3">III. A third argument, in &s;upport of our doctrine, is drawn from the plain, and po&s;itive declarations of the word of God.</P>
<P>The whole &s;cope of revelation appears to be, to lead us to a view of this truth; and to &s;hew us the great and a&s;to|ni&s;hing difference, which there is, in this world, and which there will be in the next, between tho&s;e who are &s;ubjects of the grace of God, and tho&s;e who remain in their &s;ins and iniquities. And declarations to this purpo&s;e, are in|ter&s;per&s;ed in every part of the &s;criptures.</P>
<P>We &s;hall begin with that remarkable declaration of our Lord, concerning the man who betrayed him, Mark xiv. 21. <HI>Good were it for that man, if he had never been born.</HI> The plain meaning of which is, that it would have been far better for Judas never to have had exi&s;tence at all, than&punc; by his own folly and wickedne&s;s, to have expo&s;ed him&s;elf to everla&s;ting ruin and de&s;truction.</P>
<P>Now, if the time will come, be it after ever &s;o many ages, wherein Judas &s;hall be happy and glorious, this declaration cannot be true. The felicity of heaven is &s;o exqui&s;itely great, as to counterbalance every pain, which we can, in this world, or in the <HI>Limbus patrum</HI> of the <HI>pious</HI> church of Rome, undergo. Surely, infinite glory, which can never know an end; <HI>which eye hath not &s;een, nor ear heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of man to conceive of;</HI> this glory, enjoyed eternally, will render it far better for Ju|das to have been born, than not to have been &s;o. He mu&s;t ble&s;s God, to all eternity, for his exi&s;tence in &s;uch glory,
<PB N="18" REF="018207_0016_0FA5BC4FCBC467C8">
let him before have endured ever &s;o much angui&s;h, and di&s;tre&s;s; and it will be better for him to have been born, in exact proportion, between a finite, and infinite duration.</P>
<P>But, &s;urely, that doctrine, which admits Judas I&s;cariot, the covetous defrauder of his ma&s;ter in life, and the ba&s;e, treacherous betrayer of him to death; whom Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf calls, <HI>the &s;on of perdition;</HI> and who was &s;o filled with horror and de&s;pair, at his own vilene&s;s and guilt, as to put an end to his life, with his own hands: this doctrine, I &s;ay, mu&s;t be friendly to abandoned characters; and mu&s;t &s;erve to make every man's con&s;cience ea&s;y, let him live and die ever &s;o wickedly.</P>
<P>If it is declared, in the word of God, that there is one &s;in, which never &s;hall be forgiven to a man: then it follows, that any one, nay, all, who are guilty of this &s;in, &s;hall fall &s;hort of eternal life, and of con&s;equence be eternally mi|&s;erable: for no one will be &s;o ab&s;urd as to &s;ay, that men &s;hall be &s;aved, and glorified, without having their &s;ins for|given them: but our Lord him&s;elf hath &s;aid, Matt. xii. 31, 32. <HI>Wherefore I &s;ay unto you, all manner of &s;in and bla&s;|phemy &s;hall be forgiven unto men: but the bla&s;phemy again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t &s;hall not be forgiven unto men. And who&s;oever &s;peaketh a word again&s;t the Son of man, it &s;hall be forgiven him: but who&s;oever &s;peaketh again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t, it &s;hall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, nor in the world to come.</HI> This is the plain language of &s;cripture; and there are other parts of it con&s;entaneous to this. Now, we cannot &s;uppo&s;e, that &s;uch a denunciation &s;hould be made again&s;t a &s;in, of which mankind never can be guilty; becau&s;e this would be trifling with the mo&s;t important concerns of mankind, and would &s;erve only to excite u&s;ele&s;s terrors. Could no man then, had no man before, and &s;hould no one after, be guilty of this offence, we have every rea&s;on to think, that nothing would have been &s;aid concerning it. But if there is a &s;in, which never &s;hall be forgiven, either in this world, or the other; and any one man, either here|tofore hath, or hereafter &s;hall, be guilty of it; then there is one man who &s;hall not be &s;aved, and of con&s;equence the parade made by our adver&s;aries, with their univer&s;al ap|pellations, appears to be groundle&s;s. Thus much, at lea&s;t, is demon&s;trable, that the fear of being utterly denied for|givene&s;s,
<PB N="19" REF="018207_0017_0FA5BC50544EBB00">
either in time or eternity, is held up as a motive to re&s;train us from &s;in; which would not have been done, had this motive no exi&s;tence in reality. Divine revelation deals not in fictitious terrors.</P>

<P>IN order to prove the eternal duration of the puni&s;h|ment of the wicked, or that all men are not finally &s;aved, we proceed to ob&s;erve,</P>
<P>That eternal mi&s;ery is &s;et again&s;t eternal happine&s;s, is the word of God: and the one is &s;aid to be commen&s;urate with the other.</P>
<P>None pretend to di&s;pute the eternal duration of the hap|pine&s;s of the &s;aints&mdash;all agree, that they &s;hall be glorious and ble&s;&s;ed for ever:&mdash;indeed, the &s;tronge&s;t terms are made u&s;e of, to point out this duration. But terms equally &s;trong are u&s;ed, to repre&s;ent the everla&s;ting puni&s;hment of the wicked: &mdash;the mi&s;ery of the one, is &s;et in contra&s;t with the happi|ne&s;s of the other.</P>
<P>In Rom. vi. la&s;t, the apo&s;tle Paul makes this declara|tion, <HI>The wages of &s;in is death, but the gift of God is eternal life, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, our Lord.</HI> Here the mi&s;ery and ruin, con&s;equent upon &s;in, are evidently contra&s;ted with the life and happine&s;s, which will be the reward of the &s;aints of God. The one is &s;et over again&s;t the other.</P>
<P>But this contra&s;t, and the eternal duration of the &s;aint's glory, and the &s;inner's puni&s;hment, are mo&s;t &s;trikingly di&s;|played, in the account given of the general judgment, by our Lord him&s;elf, Matt. xxv. He there de&s;cribes the charac|ter of the &s;aint and the &s;inner: he declares what evidence &s;hall be produced, to prove this character: he relates the &s;entence which &s;hall be pa&s;&s;ed upon both, according to their character and de&s;erts. The righteous &s;hall receive a plaudit from their Judge, and &s;hall <HI>inherit the kingdom pre|pared for them from the foundation of the world.</HI> The &s;entence of the wicked is to be pronounced in the&s;e terms&mdash;(trem|ble, our &s;ouls, when ye hear it, le&s;t it &s;hould be your fate!) &mdash;<HI>Depart from me, ye cur&s;ed, into everla&s;ting fire, prepared for
<PB N="20" REF="018207_0018_0FA5BC525DDCB6E0">
the devil and his angels.</HI> The whole account is clo&s;ed thus; <HI>And the&s;e</HI> (i. e. the wicked) <HI>&s;hall go away into everla&s;ting puni&s;hment, but the righteous into life eternal.</HI></P>
<P>And with re&s;pect to the la&s;t &s;entence quoted, it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that the very &s;ame word is u&s;ed in the Greek, to expre&s;s <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> and <HI>eternal,</HI> (the word aioonios) and our tran&s;lators altered the phra&s;es, probably, to avoid a too frequent repetition of the &s;ame term. Here then, without di&s;pute, the mi&s;ery of the wicked is put in con|tra&s;t with the happine&s;s of the righteous. The &s;ame term, preci&s;ely, expre&s;&s;es the duration of the happine&s;s of one, and the mi&s;ery of the other: &s;o that, according to this de|claration of our Lord, tho&s;e who die impenitent, and un|believing, &s;hall be mi&s;erable as long as tho&s;e, who obey the go&s;pel, &s;hall be happy. The&s;e, our opponents them&s;elves allow, &s;hall be ble&s;&s;ed and glorious as long as God exi&s;ts: and doth it not follow, then, that the impenitent &s;hall be mi&s;erable as long?</P>
<P>The fire, into which the finally impenitent are to be ca&s;t, is called here, everla&s;ting fire, (to pur to aioonion); and their puni&s;hment is &s;tyled, an everla&s;ting puni&s;hment. This ar|gument would carry demon&s;tration with it, were it not true, that the word is &s;ometimes u&s;ed in a limited &s;en&s;e, in the &s;criptures of divine revelation.</P>
<P>That it is not always u&s;ed in a limited &s;en&s;e (as &s;ome have had the hardine&s;s to a&s;&s;ert) will be evident to you, when I a&s;&s;ure you (from a careful examination of the Septuagint tran&s;lation, and the Greek te&s;tament) that the word is often, nay, by far oftener (perhaps as much as nine times in ten) u&s;ed to &s;ignify an unlimited duration. Thus is the word (aioonios) u&s;ed to repre&s;ent the eternity of God, Gen. xxi. 33. I&s;ai. xl. 28. Rom. vi. 26. It is u&s;ed, likewi&s;e, to repre&s;ent his attributes, which are &s;urely everla&s;ting, as P&s;al. c. 5. His mercy is <HI>everla&s;ting.</HI> P&s;al. cxix. 142. Thy righteou&s;ne&s;s is an <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> righteou&s;ne&s;s. It is u&s;ed to repre&s;ent the duration of the divine govern|ment, Dan. iv. 3. His kingdom is an <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> kingdom.</P>
<P>This phra&s;e is almo&s;t univer&s;ally made u&s;e of, to repre|&s;ent the duration of the &s;aint's happine&s;s, as well as of the &s;inner's mi&s;ery. I&s;ai. xxxv. 10. And the ran&s;omed of the Lord &s;hall return, and come to Zion, with &s;ongs, and <HI>ever|la&s;ting</HI>
<PB N="21" REF="018207_0019_0FA5BC529CE05D50">
joy upon their heads. Dan. xii. 2. And many of them that &s;leep in the du&s;t of the earth, &s;hall awake; &s;ome to <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> life, and &s;ome to &s;hame, and <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> contempt. John iii. 16. For God &s;o loved the world, as to give his only begotten &s;on, that who&s;oever believeth in him, &s;hould not peri&s;h, but have <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> life. I&s;ai. xxxiii. 14. The &s;inners in Zion are afraid, fearfulne&s;s hath &s;urpri&s;ed the hypocrites. Who among us &s;hall dwell with devouring fire? Who among&s;t us &s;hall dwell with <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> burning? 2 The&s;&s;. i. 9. Who (&s;peaking of them that know not God, and obey not the go&s;pel of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t) &s;hall be puni&s;hed with <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> de&s;truction, from the pre|&s;ence of the Lord, and the glory of his power.</P>
<P>We have proved, that the word (aioonios) refers, often, to an unlimited duration; and in order to prove that it doth &s;o in this xxvth Matt. we ob&s;erve, that it is here u&s;ed to expre&s;s the everla&s;ting happine&s;s of the &s;aints, which, &s;ay our opponents, is proved by other phra&s;es in &s;cripture. But if this duration is unlimited, and appears &s;o beyond di&s;|pute, then the duration of the puni&s;hment of the wicked is &s;o, for the &s;ame phra&s;e is u&s;ed to repre&s;ent the one, as the other: and the happine&s;s of the one, is not only here, but in many other parts of &s;cripture, contra&s;ted with the mi|&s;ery of the other. It is by no means probable, that a phra&s;e, &s;ignifying a limited duration, in the beginning of a &s;hort ver&s;e, would be u&s;ed, before the conclu&s;ion of it, to point out an unlimited one.</P>
<P>It hath been &s;aid, by &s;ome a&s;&s;erters of univer&s;al &s;alvation, that tho&s;e repre&s;ented as &s;tanding on the left hand, are the &s;ins of mankind, which are to be puni&s;hed, while the men them&s;elves e&s;cape: that men's &s;ins are the tares, but they are the wheat.</P>
<P>This is a &s;uppo&s;ition almo&s;t too ridiculous to need any notice; but weak minds have been affected by it: it is proper, therefore, to &s;ay, that it is impo&s;&s;ible, in the na|ture of things, to &s;eparate the &s;in from the &s;inner, becau&s;e no action can po&s;&s;ibly exi&s;t, &s;eparate from, or independent of, the agent. Is it po&s;&s;ible that there &s;hould be murder without a murderer? Can the murder be puni&s;hed, with|out the puni&s;hment of him who committed it? Is there any per&s;onality, any con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, any prai&s;e, or blame,
<PB N="22" REF="018207_0020_0FA5BC54194139A8">
in mere &s;imple actions, &s;eparate from their agent? Let us only <HI>think</HI> a &s;ingle moment, and we &s;hall &s;ee the fallacy of this idea. Our thoughts, our volitions, our actions, are a part of our&s;elves; they depend upon us, and cannot be &s;eparated from us.</P>
<P>Shifting their po&s;ition, the univer&s;ali&s;ts have again &s;aid, that by the goats on the left hand, in this xxv Matth. are intended, the devils; but that the &s;heep, on the right hand, point out mankind.</P>
<P>But we &s;hall find, if we look into the account, that both the &s;heep, and the goats, are addre&s;&s;ed as per&s;ons of the &s;ame nature, under the &s;ame obligations to the &s;ame duties, in con&s;equence of the relations they &s;u&s;tain. The goats are condemned, for the omi&s;&s;ion of the &s;ame duties, on account of the performance of which, the &s;heep are re|warded. But the devils are not bound to the&s;e duties; they are not placed in &s;uch a relation to mankind; nor are they &s;o conver&s;ant among them, as to render it &s;uitable for them to perform the&s;e duties. What man wi&s;hes the devils to <HI>feed,</HI> or <HI>give him drink</HI>? Who doth not deprecate their taking him in? Who de&s;ires &s;uch clothing, as the&s;e malevolent &s;pirits would be&s;tow upon him? Who de&s;ires their company, or wi&s;hes the devils to <HI>vi&s;it him,</HI> when he is <HI>&s;ick, and in pri&s;on</HI>? And who, according to the account given of them, in holy writ, can &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e duties to be incumbent upon them? And will, we a&s;k once more, the righteous, and holy Judge of the world, condemn any of his creatures, bad as they may be in them&s;elves, for not doing that which they are under no obligation to do?</P>
<P>In pro&s;ecution of the argument, drawn from the &s;crip|tures, to prove the eternal duration of the puni&s;hment of the wicked, we proceed to quote Matt. xviii. 8. <HI>Where|fore, if thy hand, or the foot offend thee, cut them off, and ca&s;t them from thee. It is better for thee to enter into life halt, or maimed, rather than having two hands, or two feet, to be ca&s;t into everla&s;ting fire.</HI> In the next ver&s;e, this is &s;tyled <HI>hell fire;</HI> which proves plainly, that it refers to that &s;tate of puni&s;hment, upon which the wicked enter after death.</P>
<P>But this is &s;till more plainly di&s;covered, and the truth of our doctrine proved, by the parallel place, Mark ix. 43. Here it is &s;tyled; <HI>the fire that never &s;hall be quenched;</HI> (eis to
<PB N="23" REF="018207_0021_0FA5BC5622A60690">
pur to a&s;be&s;ton). This adjective expre&s;&s;es the perpetuity of the puni&s;hment of the wicked, from its very nature. It hath a principle of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence within it&s;elf, which can be de|&s;troyed by no continuance, or perpetuity of di&s;tre&s;s. Thus the phra&s;e, (a&s;be&s;tos,) is made u&s;e of, by naturali&s;ts, to expre&s;s a kind of mineral, which was well known to the ancients, and is to us in the&s;e days. It is ea&s;ily inflammable; but it never con&s;umes in the fire. It doth not &s;uffer the lea&s;t diminution, nor &s;eparation of its parts, from the fire. Nor doth it decrea&s;e in its weight, from being burnt ever &s;o long. This is a fact well known. And perhaps no one body in nature, can be produced, which more plainly points out, the unquenchable fire of the bottomle&s;s pit; which is continually burning, but &s;till never exhau&s;ts its fuel; which preys upon the heart-&s;trings of tho&s;e who endure it, without putting an end to their exi&s;tence, or dimini&s;hing their capacity to endure it.</P>
<P>Our Lord goes on, in ver&s;e 44, to &s;peak of hell, as the place <HI>where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.</HI> The time &s;hall never come, when the agony and di&s;tre&s;s, which is repre&s;ented by the worm, and the fire, &s;hall come to a period. It is plain our Lord meant, to point out the puni&s;hment of the wicked; of tho&s;e who followed the dictates of their own corrupt hearts, and who would not deny them&s;elves for his &s;ake. It follows, therefore, that the time &s;hall never come, when the puni&s;hment of the&s;e men (be it what it may) &s;hall have a period.</P>
<P>In order to evade the force of this text, the advocates for univer&s;al &s;alvation, explain it thus: The worm &s;hall not die, and the fire &s;hall not be quenched, while the wicked continue in purgatory, or a &s;tate of puni&s;hment. But, &s;urely, this is to render the text perfectly nugatory: for the language of this interpretation is, as long as the worm lives, it &s;hall not die: and as long as the fire burns, it &s;hall not be quenched: the wicked &s;hall be puni&s;hed as long as they are puni&s;hed! This is mere trifling with lan|guage: and interpretations of this kind, can make the bible mean any thing, or nothing. If the&s;e per&s;ons will examine the Septuagint tran&s;lation of our text, they will find, that it expre&s;&s;es the &s;entiment thus: Where their worm &s;hall <HI>never</HI> die, and their fire &s;hall <HI>never</HI> be quench|ed:
<PB N="24" REF="018207_0022_0FA5BC5663E214B8">
&mdash;which militates, entirely, with the interpretation they give, as well as with their &s;entiments at large.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who hold to univer&s;al &s;alvation, in order to evade the force of the argument again&s;t them, drawn from the happine&s;s of heaven being repre&s;ented by a term, &s;ignifying an equal duration with the torments of hell, have ob&s;erv|ed, that the &s;criptures &s;peak of the happine&s;s of heaven, as to its duration, in other terms, be&s;ides that of <HI>everla&s;ting:</HI> that they &s;peak of it, as incorruptible, &amp;c. but they for|get, that the &s;ame argument may be brought to prove, the eternal duration of the puni&s;hment of the wicked. In our text, in Mark ix. the torments of hell are pointed out, by an unquenchable fire; a fire durable, and la&s;ting in its own nature; and by a worm which knows no period to its exi&s;tence; but always lives, and lives to gnaw. Surely the&s;e phra&s;es convey an idea, of an inheritance for the finally impenitent, equally incorruptible, though far dif|ferent, in its nature, from that which is laid up for the &s;aints in glory. We may remark, al&s;o, that the puni&s;h|ment of the wicked, is repre&s;ented to us, as <HI>an everla&s;ting de&s;truction from the pre&s;ence of the Lord, and the glory of his power.</HI></P>
<P>The nature, the exqui&s;ite nature of the puni&s;hment of tho&s;e who die in their &s;ins, may be gathered from the metaphors, by which they are pointed out in the word of God. There is none of the&s;e more terrible, than that of fire burning, and con&s;uming continually, without putting an end to our exi&s;tence. Perhaps nothing cau&s;es keener angui&s;h to the body, than the application of fire. That mu&s;t, then, be a torment inconceivably great, which can, in any &s;en&s;e, an&s;wer to this metaphor.</P>
<P>The <HI>eternity</HI> of the torments of hell, is like vi&s;e conveyed by this metaphor, Rev. xiv. 11. <HI>And the &s;moke of their tor|ment a&s;cendeth up</HI> FOR EVER <HI>and</HI> EVER; <HI>and they have no re&s;t, day nor night, who wor&s;hip the bea&s;t, and his image, and who&s;oever receiveth the mark of his name.</HI> The de&s;ign of this text cannot be mi&s;taken; we know that it refers to future puni&s;hment; and it is peculiarly ob&s;ervable on this account: the phra&s;e, by which the duration of this pu|ni&s;hment is expre&s;&s;ed, (eis aioonas aioonoon) is univer&s;ally applied, both in the old, and new te&s;tament, to an unli|mited
<PB N="25" REF="018207_0023_0FA5BC5724D63CA0">
duration. It is not, in a &s;ingle in&s;tance, u&s;ed to expre&s;s any other. It is never applied, to point out a li|mited term. And we would a&s;k our opponents, whether they know of any Greek phra&s;e, u&s;ed in the bible, in the writings of the fathers of the church, or profane authors, which conveys a &s;tronger idea of eternity? This phra&s;e is made u&s;e of, in &s;cripture, to &s;ignify the duration of that Being, who liveth for ever and ever; as al&s;o the everla&s;t|ing mi&s;ery of the grand enemy of mankind. It is u&s;ed, al&s;o, Rev. xix. 3. as well as in this place, to point out, the duration of the puni&s;hment of &s;uch, as die in their &s;ins; and can mean nothing &s;hort of an eternal one.</P>
<P>In addition to the texts, already quoted, to prove the eternity of hell torments, we will now &s;ugge&s;t to your con&s;ideration, two or three, in which it is, in &s;o many words, &s;aid, that all men &s;hall not be &s;aved.</P>
<P>And the fir&s;t, is the declaration of our Lord him&s;elf, Matt. xxii. 14. <HI>For many are called, but few are cho&s;en.</HI> This is a moral, drawn from the parable of the marriage fea&s;t; and of the man, who had not on the wedding gar|ment. The expre&s;&s;ion is plain, and without limitation; and mu&s;t mean, at lea&s;t, as much as this: that every one, &s;aint and &s;inner, with the wedding garment, and without it, &s;hall not finally inherit the kingdom of heaven. If it means not as much as this, it means nothing: and this is all the u&s;e, which we purpo&s;e, at pre&s;ent, to make of it.</P>
<P>More expre&s;s, if po&s;&s;ible, is that a&s;&s;ertion of our Lord, in his &s;ermon upon the mount, Matt. vii. 13, 14. <HI>Enter ye in at the &s;trait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to de&s;truction; and many there be, which go in thereat: becau&s;e &s;trait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life; and few there be that find it.</HI> Here Chri&s;t him&s;elf &s;ays, that there are but few, comparatively, who find the way to eternal life. How diametrically con|trary to this, is the propo&s;ition, that all &s;hall at la&s;t find it, and be happy!</P>
<P>In one of the journeys, made by our Lord, when upon earth, a certain per&s;on came to him, and a&s;ked a que&s;tion, highly important: <HI>Lord, are there few that be &s;aved</HI>? To this, Chri&s;t replies, in a manner &s;imilar to his declaration upon the mount: Luke xiii. 24. <HI>Strive to enter in at the
<PB N="26" REF="018207_0024_0FA5BC57EF01B100">
&s;trait gate; for many, I &s;ay unto you, will &s;eek to enter in, and &s;hall not be able.</HI> He then goes on, in a parabolical manner, to point out, the mi&s;erable fate of tho&s;e profe&s;&s;ors of religion, who delay their preparation for death, till it comes upon them; the addition which it will make to their &s;ufferings, to behold the happine&s;s of others, and the numbers of Gentiles who &s;hall obtain the kingdom of heaven; while the Jews, who thought, they alone &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s it, are ca&s;t out. Now, if there are any, who &s;hall &s;eek to enter into the kingdom of heaven at the la&s;t day, (for to this, Chri&s;t evidently refers,) and &s;hall not be able, then there will be &s;ome excluded thence, and of con&s;e|quence, all will not be finally &s;aved.</P>
<P>The&s;e plain, and po&s;itive a&s;&s;ertions of our Saviour, &s;eem as if they demanded our a&s;&s;ent, and mu&s;t lead us to be very careful how we indulge to an hope, totally incon&s;i&s;tent with them.</P>
<P>We argue our doctrine,</P>
<P N="4">IV. From the limitation, with which all the promi&s;es of the go&s;pel are attended.</P>
<P>The&s;e promi&s;es are not made, univer&s;ally, to all men: or, it is not engaged to all men, let their character be what it may, that they &s;hall &s;hare in the ble&s;&s;ings, which this go&s;pel promi&s;es. It is only to per&s;ons of a certain cha|racter, pointed out in the go&s;pel; to &s;uch as <HI>believe, re|pent, are born again, hope, tru&s;t, overcome, are obedient,</HI> or <HI>hold out to the end,</HI> that &s;alvation is ab&s;olutely promi&s;ed, and engaged. Men of a different character; &s;uch as di&s;believe, and reject the go&s;pel; &s;uch as live, and die in &s;in, unre|pented of, and unfor&s;aken, are the objects of go&s;pel threat|enings. Thus, when it is promi&s;ed, <HI>he that believeth, &s;hall be &s;aved;</HI> it is, at the &s;ame time, threatened, <HI>he that be|lieveth not, &s;hall be damned.</HI> But it is needle&s;s to quote texts to this purpo&s;e; your own con&s;tant ob&s;ervation mu&s;t fur|ni&s;h you with them.</P>
<P>I a&s;k, now, what man hath any right, to take any en|couragement, from any one of the&s;e promi&s;es, unle&s;s he po&s;&s;e&s;s the character, to which the promi&s;e is made? I a&s;k the a&s;&s;erters of univer&s;al &s;alvation, whether they can pro|duce a &s;ingle promi&s;e of the go&s;pel, made to an unbeliever, a rejecter of go&s;pel grace, a con&s;tant, and allowed violater
<PB N="27" REF="018207_0025_0FA5BC58A2710C10">
of every command of God? And if they could, whether this would not, at once, render every di&s;tinction of cha|racter, totally unnece&s;&s;ary? If the go&s;pel promi&s;es &s;alva|tion only to men of a certain character, have any a right to expect it, but &s;uch as &s;u&s;tain this character? Or, can a di&s;pen&s;ation, which confines its benefits, in all its decla|rations, and propo&s;als, to &s;uch as &s;ubmit to it, be extended to all men, without exception? Mu&s;t not the plan of me|diation, be e&s;&s;entially altered, in its nature, before this can be the ca&s;e? What mini&s;ter of <HI>religion</HI> will &s;tand up, and tell his people, "whether you accept of the go&s;pel we preach to you, or no: whether you &s;ubmit your&s;elves to its directions, or not: whether you are good, or bad: righteous, or wicked; yet you &s;hall &s;hare in go&s;pel bene|fits, and be happy at la&s;t?"</P>
<P>The eternal duration of the puni&s;hment of the wicked, is argued,</P>
<P N="5">V. From the nature of vicious habits.</P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;trong, and immovable by any power, &s;hort of omnipotence it&s;elf. When a man hath contracted an ha|bit of thinking, and acting in a particular way: when he hath imbibed a love, and &s;trong inclination to it; and thus prefers acting, in this way, to any other, he cannot, without an extraneous power exerted, fall into a different way; becau&s;e this would be to &s;uppo&s;e, that he could choo&s;e a thing, and refu&s;e it, at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>The word of God con&s;tantly repre&s;ents vicious habits in this light, and points out the nece&s;&s;ity of an exertion of divine power, in order to overcome them. The &s;tronge&s;t metaphorical expre&s;&s;ions, as well as plain, and expre&s;s de|clarations, are u&s;ed to convey to us this truth. <HI>Can the Ethiopian change his &s;kin,</HI> a&s;ks the prophet, Jer. xiii. 23. <HI>or the leopard his &s;pots? then may ye al&s;o do good, that are ac|cu&s;tomed to do evil.</HI> Our Saviour, in &s;o many words, a&s;|&s;erts, John vi. 44. <HI>No man can come to me, except the Father, who hath &s;ent me, draw him.</HI> Thus do the &s;criptures &s;peak of the inveteracy of vicious habits.</P>
<P>If they are thus inveterate, and the impenitent die un|der the influence of &s;uch habits, or inclinations, (as, ac|cording to the &s;uppo&s;ition, they do,) they mu&s;t remain, for ever, under the influence of them, unle&s;s a divine pow|er
<PB N="28" REF="018207_0026_0FA5BC59D046AFE0">
or is exerted upon them. But in the word of God, (whence all our knowledge of this matter ari&s;es,) we are not told, that any &s;uch power &s;hall be exerted: but, on the contrary, are led to conclude, that they will be given over to the influence of their own corrupt, and vicious hearts. Thus is it &s;olemnly a&s;&s;erted, Rev. xxii. 11. <HI>He that is unju&s;t, let him be unju&s;t &s;till: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy &s;till: and he that is righteous, let him he righteous &s;till: and he that is holy, let him be holy &s;till.</HI> This text plainly declares, that in what&s;oever &s;ituation, with re&s;pect to their moral cha|racter, men are found, at the time of which it &s;peaks; in the &s;ame &s;ituation, they &s;hall remain. That this time is the day of judgment, is evident, from the ver&s;e which fol|lows: <HI>And behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work &s;hall be.</HI> Whence it follows conclu&s;ively, that in the &s;ame &s;ituation as we are found, at the time of judgment; whether holy, or not holy; believing, or unbelieving; in that &s;ame &s;ituation &s;hall we remain, throughout eternity.</P>
<P>It is mo&s;t certain, that vicious habits &s;trengthen by in|dulgence. The longer we give way to, and are under the influence of them, the more we are attached to them; the le&s;s willing we are to be dive&s;ted of them, and the more forcible they grow; like a river, &s;mall at its &s;ource, but increa&s;ing as it flows, till its torrent becomes irre&s;i&s;tible. If the wicked, then, die under the influence of &s;uch ha|bits; if their &s;ouls are filled with malevolence to the God who made, and the beings who &s;urround them; if, as we have &s;een, no alteration will be made upon them beyond the grave; then they mu&s;t increa&s;e in this malevolence, and the expre&s;&s;ions of it, to all eternity. Their &s;ouls will not be at all more reconciled to God, or one another, by the torments they undergo; but they will be continually increa&s;ing in their rage and enmity.</P>
<P>We are led to this idea, by an expre&s;&s;ion u&s;ed by our Lord, in an expo&s;ition of a parable of his, Matt. xiii. 49, 50. <HI>So &s;hall it be at the end of the world; the angels &s;hall come forth, and &s;ever the wicked from among the ju&s;t; and &s;hall ca&s;t them into the furnace of fire: there &s;hall be wailing, and gna&s;hing of teeth.</HI> This latter expre&s;&s;ion is always u&s;ed, in &s;cripture, to convey to us, an idea of the highe&s;t degree
<PB N="29" REF="018207_0027_0FA5BC5A38073748">
of rage, and malevolence; the utmo&s;t exacerbation of an|ger. Thus &s;aith Job, xvi. 9. <HI>He teareth me in his wrath, who hateth me; he gna&s;heth upon me with his teeth.</HI> The &s;ame expre&s;&s;ion is u&s;ed, to expre&s;s the rage, and cruel pa&s;&s;ion, which filled the brea&s;ts of the Jews again&s;t Ste|phen, when he had faithfully reproved them for their &s;ins, Acts vii. 54. <HI>When they heard the&s;e things, they were cut to the heart; and they gna&s;hed on him with their teeth.</HI></P>
<P>When, therefore, hell is de&s;cribed as the place of <HI>gna&s;h|ing of teeth,</HI> we are led to conceive of the rage, and impo|tent re&s;entment, which fills the brea&s;ts of the mi&s;erable inhabitants, again&s;t God, and goodne&s;s. From the in|dulgence, and unlimited expre&s;&s;ion of this rage, according to their ability, it will increa&s;e, and gain &s;trength, in&s;tead of being dimini&s;hed, or aboli&s;hed; and of con&s;equence, they will, to eternity, remain under the influence, and puni&s;hment of it. We argue,</P>
<P N="6">VI. That the doctrine of univer&s;al &s;alvation, is not true, becau&s;e it hath a tendency to dimini&s;h, and enervate the motives, by which men are urged to embrace the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>No doctrine can come from God, which hath a tendency to introduce licentiou&s;ne&s;s, or lead men to de&s;pi&s;e the law, or go&s;pel of God: for this would contradict his nature, which is pure, and holy; and would be totally incon&s;i&s;t|ent with, and oppo&s;ite to, the other doctrines of the go&s;|pel of Chri&s;t: for he came into the world, not to de&s;troy, but to fulfil, the law of morality.</P>
<P>We know that one of the mo&s;t &s;trong, and powerful arguments, u&s;ed in the &s;criptures, to quicken men to em|brace the go&s;pel, and &s;ubmit to its precepts, is drawn from the fatal con&s;equences, with which a rejection of them, and di&s;obedience to it, will be attended. We are warned <HI>to flee from the wrath to come. Knowing the terrors of the Lord,</HI> the mini&s;ters of religion <HI>per&s;uade men.</HI> Sen&s;ible that <HI>the wrath of God is revealed from heaven, again&s;t all ungodli|ne&s;s, and unrighteou&s;ne&s;s of men,</HI> they <HI>be&s;eech men, in Chri&s;t's &s;tead, to become reconciled unto God.</HI> And they u&s;e the ter|rors of the law, as the mo&s;t powerful inducement, to a|waken &s;inners from their &s;tupid lethargy, and rou&s;e them to attend to their mo&s;t intere&s;ting concerns.</P>
<P>And, in the pre&s;ent melancholy &s;tate of human nature,
<PB N="30" REF="018207_0028_0FA5BC5B0680E2F0">
the&s;e are the mo&s;t energetic motives, which can be u&s;ed with men; and they are the mo&s;t likely to influence their minds. We know that mankind are not governed by a &s;en&s;e of rectitude: They have not &s;uch a re&s;pect to the Deity, as to cau&s;e them to follow a cour&s;e of conduct in|con&s;i&s;tent with their pa&s;&s;ions, in order to plea&s;e, or to ho|nour him. We know, on the contrary, that they are univer&s;ally attached to &s;inful indulgences: They love iniquity of every kind, and follow it with greedine&s;s; Nothing, therefore, but the terror of heavy puni&s;hment, the apprehen&s;ion of endle&s;s ruin, will excite them to for|&s;ake their &s;inful cour&s;es, and take up with a new cour&s;e of thinking, and acting. Mankind are not affected with a &s;en&s;e of gratitude, for benefits received: neither are they ingenuous enough, to be broken off from vice, and excited to virtue, by any motive, &s;hort of ruin and de&s;truction.</P>
<P>That doctrine, then, which hath a tendency to enervate the force of this argument, hath a tendency, likewi&s;e, to prevent the effect of the go&s;pel upon the minds of men, and of con&s;equence to introduce licentiou&s;ne&s;s. But the doctrine of univer&s;al re&s;titution, hath this tendency, be|cau&s;e it a&s;&s;ures men, that, let them act as they will, be they good or bad, righteous or wicked; although they live and die with the mo&s;t confirmed inveteracy to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to his go&s;pel, to his people, and his ways; yet the time will come, when they &s;hall get to heaven. Bring men to believe this, and in vain &s;hall we urge upon them the deformity of vice, and the excellency of virtue:&mdash;in vain &s;hall we declare to them, the plain and po&s;itive com|mands of God:&mdash;in vain &s;hall we addre&s;s their rea&s;on, their gratitude, their ingenuity. The voice of criminal incli|nation will &s;ound &s;till louder, and will be obeyed. Di|ve&s;ted of the&s;e friendly terrors, they will gratify every vicious propen&s;ity, without a check; and will mount to the highe&s;t pitch of wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P>This we know to be the ca&s;e; becau&s;e even the appre|hen&s;ion of everla&s;ting puni&s;hment, is in&s;ufficient to re&s;train depraved man, from criminal indulgences. Though he believes, and knows, that everla&s;ting mi&s;ery, and angui&s;h, will be the con&s;equence of &s;in, allowed, and per&s;i&s;ted in; yet, with all his apprehen&s;ions about him, he ru&s;hes on the
<PB N="31" REF="018207_0029_0FA5BC5BA40E1A40">
thick bo&s;&s;es of the divine buckler, and dares almighty vengeance. Though he may feel him&s;elf &s;inged with the flames of the bottomle&s;s pit; yet, &s;till he &s;ins, and &s;ins again. So &s;trong is the force of natural corruption!</P>
<P>And if apprehen&s;ions of everla&s;ting puni&s;hment, are in&s;ufficient to re&s;train the &s;inner, how much le&s;s will the fear of a few ages of purgatory, to be &s;ucceeded by endle&s;s bli&s;s? With how keen a reli&s;h, will he follow the dictates of every &s;inful propen&s;ity? His purgatory will be &s;hort; it will be but a point, when compared with eternity; and heaven will make amends for all! Thus will the &s;inner rea&s;on; and indeed, were this doctrine true, his rea&s;oning would be ju&s;t.</P>
<P>Doth not this thought prove, to every man's feeling, and conviction, the pernicious con&s;equences of a doctrine, &s;o plea&s;ing to human nature? Have we any need to di|mini&s;h the force of tho&s;e motives, by which men are, in any degree, re&s;trained from the practice of &s;in? Shall we, in this age of licentiou&s;ne&s;s, throw down any barriers, by which men are kept from &s;inful indulgence? Let the friends of the doctrine of re&s;titution, rea&s;on as they may; yet we do know, that men will indulge them&s;elves more freely in &s;in, if they believe it to be puni&s;hed only for a limited time, than if they thought it would be followed with everla&s;ting mi&s;ery. It is not acting a friendly part to mankind, then, to take away the force of this re&s;traint.</P>
<P>Were men to <HI>act,</HI> univer&s;ally, under the belief of the doctrine of re&s;titution, and indulge, without fear, to every propen&s;ity within them, which was not prevented by the force of human laws, in what a &s;tate would &s;ociety &s;oon be? Every thing that could e&s;cape the cen&s;ure of the judge, would be acted without controul; and this would would be a con&s;tant &s;cene of murder, rapine, and theft! Every moral, every religious tie, which interfered with their pa&s;&s;ions, would be bur&s;t a&s;under, with equal ca&s;e as Samp&s;on's flaxen cords; and riot, anarchy, and confu&s;ion, would univer&s;ally prevail!&mdash;Ble&s;&s;ed con&s;equences of this gentle, lulling doctrine!</P>
<P>However contemptibly religion, and its con&s;iderations, may be viewed by &s;ome, in the pre&s;ent day; yet we have every rea&s;on to believe, that the fear of everla&s;ting mi&s;ery,
<PB N="32" REF="018207_0030_0FA5BC5C6583C280">
in the world to come, re&s;trains very many, from indulging to cour&s;es, which they would otherwi&s;e &s;trenuou&s;ly pur&s;ue! The apprehen&s;ion of this ruin, keeps hold of many a man's con&s;cience, which nothing el&s;e could bind; and makes him &s;hudder at the thought of crimes, which he would otherwi&s;e freely commit! Take away this re&s;traint; make him believe, that whatever he does, or &s;ays, yet he &s;hall be happy at la&s;t; and he will become the mo&s;t abandoned of men! Now he doth much wickedne&s;s, with eternal de&s;truction before his eyes:&mdash;to how much more would he indulge, if this re&s;traint was taken away!</P>

infinite Jehovah to their &s;tandard, and pre&s;ume to &s;ay, that one thing is right for him to do, and another is not? &mdash;Surely, this is <HI>a knowledge too wonderful us.</HI> Let us remember, too, that we are parties, intere&s;ted in this ca&s;e; that we are determining, what mercy and favour &s;hall be &s;hewn to our&s;elves: and this circum&s;tance alone, is &s;uf|ficient to di&s;qualify us, from judging rightly in the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Let us &s;earch the word of God:&mdash;if this reveals the doctrine of eternal puni&s;hment, it is &s;ufficient to demand our a&s;&s;ent, and prove to us, al&s;o, that it is perfectly con|&s;i&s;tent with his mercy. When we have once e&s;tabli&s;hed in our minds, that the &s;criptures are a revelation from God, we are bound, if we would act rationally, to believe every thing they &s;ay, how much &s;oever it may &s;urpa&s;s our rea&s;on. We know that the Almighty will not impo&s;e upon us&mdash;we know, too, that he cannot be impo&s;ed upon, or reveal that for truth, which is fal&s;hood&mdash;we are a&s;&s;ured, that he knows what is con&s;i&s;tent with his mercy, and will do nothing but what is perfectly right. If, then, the doctrine we have been &s;upporting, is founded upon &s;crip|ture, (of which, judge ye!) it mu&s;t &s;tand firm, and e&s;tab|li&s;hed; and this objection doth not, in the lea&s;t, affect it.</P>
<P>But even, on the views of the objectors, we are not &s;ure, that &s;uch a puni&s;hment, as we have been &s;peaking of, is incon&s;i&s;tent with the mercy and goodne&s;s of God. What &s;hould we think of a legi&s;lator, who guarded his laws with a &s;anction inadequate to their importance; and who &s;uf|fered his lenient di&s;po&s;ition, &s;o to influence him, as to forbid any capital puni&s;hment to be inflicted, in any ca&s;e whatever? What &s;hould we think of a judge, who was to acquit, and pardon all who were brought before him, were they innocent or guilty? Should we e&s;teem his character complete, becau&s;e his tenderne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition, would not permit him to cau&s;e any mi&s;ery, or unhappine&s;s, to the mo&s;t abandoned criminal, that was judged by him? What con&s;equences would this &s;oon have upon &s;ociety; and what crimes would it not occa&s;ion? The an&s;wer, and the appli|cation, is ea&s;y.</P>
<P>The welfare of &s;ociety, requires the puni&s;hment of tho&s;e, who violate its laws, in order that they may be re|garded; and that the end, for which government was
<PB N="34" REF="018207_0032_0FA5BC5DD4BF7E30">
in&s;tituted, may be an&s;wered. And this puni&s;hment mu&s;t be adapted to the nature of the offence, in order to its an&s;wering the purpo&s;e: if it is not, the law, and the law-makers, will be both of them contemptible. The laws of God are guarded with &s;uch a &s;anction, as we have endea|voured to &s;hew, in the pa&s;t &s;ubject. If, then, it is not executed, will it not be di&s;honorary to God? If he de|nounces threatenings, which he means not to execute; if he declares ab&s;olutely, that he will do that, which, it af|terwards appears, he never de&s;igned, nor thought of do|ing; will it not give us the idea of weakne&s;s, and want of veracity, in him? And mu&s;t not his government be con|temptible, in the &s;ight of all beings?</P>
<P>We know not of what importance the eternal puni&s;h|ment of the wicked may be, to promote the happine&s;s, and maintain the order of univer&s;al being. We know not but that the inhabitants of innumerable worlds, may be re&s;trained from &s;in and folly, by beholding the mi&s;eries of this. We know not what effect the &s;ight of the mi&s;ery of the wicked, may have upon the &s;aints and angels in hea|ven, to pre&s;erve them in their integrity: for though we are a&s;&s;ured, that they &s;hall pre&s;erve it, yet we know not but that it may be in the way of means and motives. So much as this we know, that the puni&s;hment of the wicked will di&s;play, to all per&s;ons, and all worlds, the glory of the divine ju&s;tice and holine&s;s.</P>
<P>If God hath declared to &s;inners, that the con&s;equences of their crimes &s;hall be eternal death; and they, with this con&s;equence before their eyes, freely and voluntarily do that, to which this puni&s;hment is annexed, can they charge God with inju&s;tice, and want of mercy, if he inflicts it upon them? Are they not paying the price, which they knew they &s;hould have to pay, for their vicious indulgence? What plea will they have to make, to excu&s;e them from &s;uffering it? Will not their <HI>mouths be &s;topped, and their &s;ouls become guilty before God?</HI> They knew, when they commit|ted &s;in, that this would be the con&s;equence of it; and who, but them&s;elves, can they blame, if they feel this con&s;e|quence?</P>
<P>We are always to remember, that God is ju&s;t, as well as merciful. Indi&s;criminate mercy, in a judge, is inju&s;tice.
<PB N="35" REF="018207_0033_0FA5BC610B1E9E60">
God owes &s;omething to his rectitude and holine&s;s, to his aver&s;ion from &s;in, as well as to his mercy. One perfection is not to &s;wallow up another, or crowd it out from exerci&s;e.</P>
<Q>"A God all mercy, is a God unju&s;t."</Q>
<P>Strict, inflexible ju&s;tice, requires the everla&s;ting puni&s;h|ment of the &s;inner, who here refu&s;es and rejects offered &s;alvation. This, our antagoni&s;ts will not deny. And is it right, that mercy &s;hould overcome the dictates of ju&s;tice, in every in&s;tance whatever? The an&s;wer is ea&s;y.</P>
<P>Our antagoni&s;ts a&s;k, whether we wi&s;h, or de&s;ire, the wor&s;t enemy we have in the world, to be eternally mi&s;era|ble? We an&s;wer, with truth, in the negative!&mdash;They a&s;k again, is not God more compa&s;&s;ionate than you? We re|ply, without doubt; but he is more ju&s;t too. A man of true humanity, never beheld a criminal executed, without wi&s;hing to reprieve him, if it could be done with &s;afety to &s;ociety. But his compa&s;&s;ion would be weakne&s;s, if he wi&s;hed to &s;pare him, and let him loo&s;e again, to murder, rob, and de&s;troy. It may be &s;aid, that the com|pari&s;on does not hold: but we a&s;k, who fir&s;t introduced it?</P>
<P>Upon the whole, if we con&s;ider our utter incapacity to judge, with preci&s;ion, upon the divine nature and will; the certainty with which we may depend upon what re|velation declares; if we realize, again, what, even in our view, belongs to the character of a ju&s;t judge; and re|member, that the divine ju&s;tice is as truly amiable as his mercy; we &s;hall &s;ee the objection to have no weight.</P>
<P>OBJ. 2. It is objected again, that no puni&s;hment can be ju&s;t, but that which is calculated for the good of the offender.</P>
<P>This is not true; for capital puni&s;hments, for certain offences, are pre&s;cribed by the law of God, and adopted by every nation. Such capital puni&s;hments, reaching to the life of the offend&eacute;r, cannot be calculated to promote his good. Let men (if they will be governed by their own ideas) only rea&s;on upon the doctrine before us, as they do in other ca&s;es, and many difficulties will vani&s;h, which now ob&s;truct the truth from their view.</P>
<P>We reject, with horror, the idea, that the Almighty puni&s;hes any, from the &s;ame principle, which, in man, is revenge, or re&s;entment&mdash;we know, that he hath no male|volence
<PB N="36" REF="018207_0034_0FA5BC630BD61720">
in his nature; and we may be a&s;&s;ured, that, if he puni&s;hes any of his creatures with an infinite puni&s;hment, it is becau&s;e he &s;ees it nece&s;&s;ary, fit and right, that he &s;hould do &s;o. God will do no wrong, nor injury, to any of his creatures; but will manife&s;t him&s;elf to be ju&s;t, and merciful in his conduct, towards them.</P>
<P>OBJ. 3. We will now proceed to con&s;ider tho&s;e texts of &s;cripture, which are produced to prove, that all men &s;hall be &s;aved.</P>
<P>And here we mu&s;t remark, that no &s;cripture is of pri|vate interpretation&mdash;that we are not to form our ideas of a doctrine, from a &s;ingle text of &s;cripture, or from &s;everal &s;uch, how plau&s;ible &s;oever they may appear, if that doctrine contradicts the general run of &s;cripture, and is incon&s;i&s;tent with the univer&s;al ideas held out by the word of God. The Holy Gho&s;t is the be&s;t interpreter of his own mean|ing&mdash;he be&s;t knows what he intended by his own decla|rations&mdash;<HI>for what man knoweth the things of a man, &s;ave the &s;pirit of a man which is in him? Even &s;o, the things of God knoweth no man, but the &s;pirit of God.</HI> 1. Cor ii. 11.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t text produced by the univer&s;ali&s;ts, which we &s;hall mention, is, 1 Tim. ii. 4. <HI>Who will have all men to be &s;aved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.</HI> This, our antagoni&s;ts &s;ay, proves, that God is willing that all men &s;hall enjoy eternal life; and that they &s;hall actually do &s;o.</P>
<P>We agree with them, that there is &s;alvation for all men: that this is freely offered to the chief of &s;inners in the go&s;pel: that it is God's will, that they &s;hould accept of it; nay, his po&s;itive commandment.</P>
<P>It is the will of God, that all men &s;hould both now, and hereafter, obey his commands, and be perfectly holy. Who will &s;ay, that God doth not will all men to do as, he requires them? But we know, that they do not comply with his will; neither doth he exert his almighty power, to make them do &s;o. All men are not holy, and yet the apo&s;tle &s;aith, 1 The&s;&s;. iv. 3. <HI>This is the will of God, even your &s;anctification.</HI> God never wills men to be any other|wi&s;e than holy, for he commands them all to be &s;o: but we &s;ee he leaves them to their own choice; and if they will not obey his commandments, he will puni&s;h them ac|cordingly. There is nothing in the text produced, which
<PB N="37" REF="018207_0035_0FA5BC6352715BF8">
proves more than this, that God commands, and therefore wills, all men to believe, to be holy, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;alva|tion. This is agreeable to him; and he <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> agreeablene&s;s, by the pains which he <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">, in every age of the world.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, this text hath a direct connection with the ex|hortation of the apo&s;tle, v. 1, 2, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">. <HI>I exhort therefore, that fir&s;t of all, &s;upplications, prayers, interce&s;&s;ions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men; for kings, and for all in authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life, in all godline&s;s and hone&s;ty: for this is good and acceptable in the &s;ight of God our &s;aviour, who will have all men to be &s;aved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.</HI> As a motive to quicken the Chri&s;tian mini&s;ter, to whom he wrote, to pray for the progre&s;s of the go&s;pel, and the happine&s;s of mankind in con&s;equence, the apo&s;tle declares, that &s;uch prayers would be acceptable in the &s;ight of God; it was grateful to him, to have prayers made for the progre&s;s of the go&s;pel, becau&s;e God willed, and commanded all men to &s;ubmit to it, and be &s;aved. He was not to confine his good wi&s;hes and prayers to one nation, or part of the world only, becau&s;e God did not mean thus to confine the ble&s;&s;ings of it; but willed all men to believe, and obey it. The &s;ub&s;equent context proves this interpretation to be right&mdash;<HI>for there is one God, and one mediator between God and man, the man Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who gave him&s;elf a ran&s;om for all, to be te&s;tified in due time.</HI> Men ought not to wor&s;hip idols, when there is but one God&mdash;they ought not to de&s;pair of pardon and acceptance, becau&s;e there is one mediator between God and man&mdash;they may be a&s;&s;ured, that, let their nation or character be what they may, they are &s;till welcome to his mediation, for <HI>he died a ran&s;om for all;</HI> and he &s;hall be te&s;tified as a &s;aviour to all, in due time&mdash;the period &s;hall arrive, when the go&s;pel &s;hall be preached to every creature, and have an univer&s;al &s;pread.</P>
<P>Coming to the knowledge of the truth, is mentioned, in this text, as nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation: but if all men &s;hall enjoy it at la&s;t, let them be ever &s;o ignorant, or ever &s;o wicked, then how can this knowledge be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation?</P>
<P>When it is &s;aid, 1 Tim. iv. 10. that <HI>God is the &s;aviour of
<PB N="38" REF="018207_0036_0FA5BC64F14BA4E8">
all men, e&s;pecially of tho&s;e that believe,</HI> it evidently refers to a temporal &s;alvation; to &s;upport under, and deliverance from, outward affliction; becau&s;e it is thus introduced&mdash; <HI>for therefore, we both labour and &s;uffer reproach, becau&s;e we tru&s;t in the living God, who,</HI> &amp;c. All men, in every age, and every country, experience a greater or le&s;s degree of this &s;alvation: but tho&s;e who believe; and are thus &s;avingly intere&s;ted in go&s;pel ble&s;&s;ings, may depend upon &s;pecial, and peculiar &s;upports, under troubles of every kind.</P>
<P>The latter part of the 5th Rom. is quoted by our oppo&s;ers, to &s;upport their &s;entiments: but if we con&s;ider it atten|tively, and compare it with the connection in which it &s;tands, and other declarations of the &s;ame apo&s;tle, we &s;hall find, that the general truths, meant to be conveyed by St. Paul, are the&s;e&mdash;that, although one &s;in involved the whole world of mankind in mi&s;ery, yet, under the go&s;pel, many and aggravated offences, &s;hould not prevent any man's &s;alvation:&mdash;that we are placed, by the grace of God, in a &s;tate of probation, far preferable to that of Adam, becau&s;e one fall ruined him, but we may be pardoned many offen|ces:&mdash;that believers, under the go&s;pel, are entitled to greater privileges here, and greater glory hereafter, than Adam was, in innocence; and therefore the grace and goodne&s;s of Chri&s;t hath abounded far above the &s;in of Adam:&mdash;we were lo&s;t in one, we may be &s;aved in one, if our own folly and perver&s;ene&s;s prevent not.&mdash;If every ill con&s;equence of the fall of Adam, is removed from every man, and he is in a better &s;ituation than he would have been if Adam had retained his innocence, (as the declara|tion of the apo&s;tle mu&s;t prove, as it is interpreted by the univer&s;ali&s;ts); then why do &s;o many troubles and di&s;tre&s;&s;es remain among men; and why is any puni&s;hment inflicted upon them even here&mdash;why is not this world a paradi&s;e&mdash; and what right hath death to deprive us of exi&s;tence here? It may be &s;aid, with truth, that the&s;e are nece&s;&s;ary; that the happine&s;s of the whole, is promoted by the &s;ufferings of a part. But if it is nece&s;&s;ary, that puni&s;hment and &s;uf|fering &s;hould take place now, who can &s;ay, it will not be equally nece&s;&s;ary to eternity? For, the &s;ame rea&s;ons, which make it right and fit for God to inflict temporary puni&s;h|ment, will make it equally right and fit, for ought we, or the univer&s;ali&s;ts know, to inflict eternal puni&s;hment.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="018207_0037_0FA5BC6709698BC0">The a&s;&s;ertion of the apo&s;tle, 1 Cor. xv. 22. <HI>For as in Adam all die, even &s;o in Chri&s;t &s;hall all be made alive,</HI> is an|other text, upon which some unthinking a&s;&s;erters of uni|ver&s;al redemption, found their belief:&mdash;but if we examine the chapter, from beginning to end, we &s;hall find, that it is addre&s;&s;ed only to, and &s;peaks only of, &s;aints, or believers in Je&s;us Chri&s;t; &s;uch as believed, as were not yet <HI>in their &s;ins,</HI> as &s;hould be <HI>the fir&s;t fruits of Chri&s;t at his coming.</HI> But was not this the ca&s;e, the apo&s;tle is &s;peaking, for ought that appears, of nothing more, nor le&s;s, than a re&s;urrection from temporal death. The idea, conveyed by his words, is &s;imply this:&mdash;As all men are &s;ubject to temporal death, in con&s;equence of the fall of the fir&s;t Adam, &s;o all men &s;hall be rai&s;ed to natural life again, at the re&s;urrection, in con&s;equence of the &s;ufferings of the &s;econd Adam. Of the re&s;urrection of the body, and of that only, is the apo&s;tle di&s;cour&s;ing, in this chapter; and to make the text quoted, refer to eternal &s;alvation, is neither more, nor le&s;s, than wre&s;ting its &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>The declaration of the apo&s;tle, with re&s;pect to the time when Chri&s;t &s;hall deliver up the mediatorial kingdom to the Father, is another text, quoted by our oppo&s;ers, to prove their &s;entiments: <HI>Then cometh the end, when he &s;hall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the father; when he &s;hall have put down all rule, and all authority, and power: for he mu&s;t reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet:&mdash; the la&s;t enemy, that &s;hall be de&s;troyed, is death.</HI> If we examine the&s;e texts, in the connexion wherein they &s;tand, we &s;hall find, that the apo&s;tle is &s;till &s;peaking of the day of the re&s;urrection, when a final period &s;hall be put to all the op|po&s;ition to his de&s;igns, which Chri&s;t hath met with, from men and devils: that death, which now reigns over all, both good and bad, &s;hall then be &s;ubdued: he &s;hall ac|compli&s;h all that he had in de&s;ign, when he took upon him the human nature: he &s;hall appear to have glorified his Father's mercy, and his ju&s;tice, and &s;hall give up the office of a mediator, &s;o as that he will plead no more for the pardon of the &s;ins of any, who then remain without an intere&s;t in him; but will leave them to the con&s;equences of their perver&s;e rejections of him. The&s;e things &s;hall take place at the day of judgment; for <HI>then,</HI> which in|troduces

the text we are con&s;idering, immediately &s;ucceeds, and of con&s;equence hath reference to, the time of Chri&s;t's <HI>coming:</HI> by which phra&s;e, the day of judgment is frequently pointed out in the new-te&s;tament; and therefore hath re|&s;pect unto it. Now, if there are any, who are declared to be rejected of Chri&s;t, in the judgment day (and that there are, Matth. xxv. and other places of &s;cripture, a&s;&s;ure us), then they will be for ever rejected of him, for he will act no longer in the character of a mediator&mdash;there will be none to &s;ave them. This declaration, then, in&s;tead of proving the contrary, a&s;&s;erts, implicitly, the eternal dura|tion of the puni&s;hment of the wicked.</P>
<P>In 1 Joh. iii. 8. it is &s;aid, <HI>He that committeth &s;in, is of the devil; for the devil &s;inneth from the beginning: for this pur|po&s;e, the Son of God was manife&s;ted, that he might de&s;troy the works of the devil.</HI> This, &s;trange as it may appear, is de|clared to be a &s;trong proof, that all men &s;hall be finally &s;aved. But who, without a favourite &s;y&s;tem to &s;upport, would have thought of putting any other interpretation upon the words, than &s;imply this?&mdash;All who live in &s;in, and will not for&s;ake it, are of the devil: Chri&s;t came into the world, to de&s;troy &s;in, to bring men off from it: no man is, therefore, &s;ubject to Chri&s;t, or can be entitled to his ble&s;&s;ings, who lives in &s;in.&mdash;View it in its connexion, and in its plain, obvious meaning, you will find it to be parallel to tho&s;e&mdash;<HI>No man can &s;erve two ma&s;ters.&mdash;Do we, then, make void the law, through faith? God forbid: yea, we e&s;tabli&s;h the law.</HI>&mdash;But, even in the &s;en&s;e of our op|po&s;ers, it proves nothing in their favour: if we &s;uppo&s;e &s;inners to be meant, by the works of the devil, we know that they &s;hall be puni&s;hed with an everla&s;ting de&s;truction, from the pre&s;ence of the Lord, and the glory of his power. Their puni&s;hment is pointed out in the word of God, by the term, de&s;truction: and the text will, in this &s;en&s;e, prove no more nor le&s;s than this, that Chri&s;t came to pu|ni&s;h, and de&s;troy the finally impenitent.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, that if the devil puni&s;hes men to all eternity, then &s;o many as are &s;ubject to it, are &s;uffered to live in rebellion again&s;t God; and he is deprived of their &s;ervice to all eternity. But this is &s;urely begging the que&s;tion, becau&s;e we &s;uppo&s;e, and believe, that God's ju&s;tice is ho|noured,
<PB N="41" REF="018207_0039_0FA5BC686A445FA0">
and his glory promoted, by the puni&s;hment of the wicked, as truly, as by the rewards of the righteous. No one imagines, that the devil holds a &s;overeignty inde|pendent of the divine permi&s;&s;ion: he is no more than the executioner of the divine ju&s;tice, upon tho&s;e who merit puni&s;hment. Let his enmity be ever &s;o great, again&s;t God and goodne&s;s, he may &s;till be made u&s;e of, contrary to his will, or purpo&s;e, to an&s;wer the ends of both. Sin is now permitted, to fulfil wi&s;e and good purpo&s;es. With|out doubt, Omnipotence could prevent its exi&s;tence&mdash;it doth not&mdash;he hath &s;ufficient rea&s;ons for this permi&s;&s;ion now; and who can tell, but that the&s;e rea&s;ons may exi&s;t for eternity?</P>
<P>It is mo&s;t certain, that God will procure his tribute of prai&s;e, from all created beings, in one way or another: if they will not glorify his mercy, they &s;hall glorify his ju&s;|tice. He will be defrauded of his prai&s;e by none of them; but they &s;hall all an&s;wer, one or other valuable purpo&s;e, to this end. In this &s;en&s;e, &s;hall every creature, that is in heaven, and upon earth, and under the earth, wor&s;hip and prai&s;e God.</P>
<P>We ought, when we go about to examine the &s;criptures, to do it with a mind open to conviction. The misfor|tune and the &s;in of many, is, that they fir&s;t embrace a doctrine, and then go thither to find proof and &s;upport for it; whereas, we ought to go, with minds open, and unprejudiced, to this fountain of in&s;truction, and gather thence, what is truth or fal&s;ehood.</P>
<P>Again, we repeat, that one &s;cripture is to be compared with another; and we are not to take detached parts of it, or &s;ingle phra&s;es, and thence rai&s;e our &s;entiments; but we are to examine into the general run of its declarations, and form a judgment according to them. Thus, as to the &s;ubject concerning which we have been treating, when we find, that there is &s;uch a &s;triking difference made be|tween the characters of the righteous and wicked; when we &s;ee &s;o many plain a&s;&s;ertions, that the wicked &s;hall be everla&s;tingly puni&s;hed; when we know, that the ble&s;&s;ings of the go&s;pel are promi&s;ed to tho&s;e only, who &s;ubmit to, and obey it; when we find it al&s;o expre&s;sly declared, that <HI>many are called, but few cho&s;en</HI>; or, in other words, that

there are few who are &s;aved; we &s;hould not, becau&s;e &s;ome &s;ingle, detached expre&s;&s;ions &s;eem to favour a contrary &s;uppo&s;ition, give up &s;o important a truth. We know, that all men, without exception, reap &s;ome benefit from the &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t; that all men are offered an intere&s;t in them; and that it will be their own fault, if any reject &s;uch an intere&s;t, and fall &s;hort of eternal life.

<P>We ought always to examine the connexion, in which any text of &s;cripture &s;tands; for this mu&s;t be taken into view, in order to determine its true meaning. We may prove any thing from the bible, or any other book, if we take only detached &s;entences, without re&s;pect to their connexion.</P>
<P>The &s;entiments and opinions of &s;ome of the fathers, and others in later times, who are &s;tyled eminent, di&s;tingui&s;hed characters, are brought to prove, that there &s;hall be a re&s;titution of all things, (in the &s;en&s;e of the univer&s;ali&s;ts). But this doth not appear to be a very cogent argument. Had <HI>we</HI> made u&s;e of it; had <HI>we</HI> (as we might) have produced the univer&s;al te&s;timony of all tho&s;e, who were &s;tyled the orthodox part of the church, we &s;hould have heard a loud outcry, about a bigoted, &s;uper&s;titious at|tachment to long received notions: we &s;hould have been directed to examine, and judge for our&s;elves, and informed, that the &s;entiments of no man influenced the judgments of our oppo&s;ers. But thus it is, when a reflection &s;uits one &s;ide of the que&s;tion, it is adopted with eagerne&s;s, and it is very right: but if it is, with equal propriety, u&s;ed on the other, it is matter of &s;corn and ridicule.</P>
<P>Some divines of England&mdash;men, indeed, of a very wandering, un&s;ettled turn of mind&mdash;with two of the fa|thers, who wrote in the early ages of Chri&s;tianity, have been cited, as holding the doctrine which we have com|bated. <HI>Origen,</HI> and <HI>Clemens of Alexandria,</HI> are the&s;e two fathers; both of them per&s;ons deeply immer&s;ed in the Platonic philo&s;ophy, and &s;ubject to &s;trange whims and conceits. Tho&s;e who are acquainted with eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory, know, that neither of them were e&s;teemed right, by the contemporary church, in this, and in other parti|culars.
<PB N="43" REF="018207_0041_0FA5BC69D488BAA8">
<HI>Origen</HI> held to the recovery of all the devils, as well as all fallen men; and perhaps he had as much rea&s;on for the one &s;entiment, as the other.</P>
<P>No one means to di&s;pute the antiquity of this doctrine; &s;ome believe it to have been one of the fir&s;t which was preached to Adam:&mdash;he heard, and, unhappily for us, he believed it. Satan, many think, delivered it to our com|mon parents in this language, <HI>Ye &s;hall not &s;urely die.</HI> He tempted them to think, that God could not, with ju&s;tice, or that he did not de&s;ign to execute his threatenings upon them. He per&s;uaded them to believe, that they &s;hould not &s;uffer the death denounced again&s;t them. The artifice &s;ucceeded, and Adam was undone.</P>
<P>Let us not be lulled to &s;leep in the &s;ame manner. We mu&s;t not flatter our&s;elves, that, let us live as we li&s;t, all will be well at la&s;t. We mu&s;t not flatter our&s;elves that God will not execute his threatenings. He is ju&s;t; he is true; he is upright, as well as merciful. Let who will tell us, that, though we live in &s;in, and die impenitent, yet we &s;hall be happy at la&s;t, we may be a&s;&s;ured, that it is the &s;yren &s;ong, which beguiled Adam to his ruin; and that, if we heed it, it will i&s;&s;ue in the &s;ame manner, as to us.</P>
<P>You will extend your patience a little longer, while we make a few ob&s;ervations upon the purgatory, to which &s;ome univer&s;ali&s;ts have had recour&s;e, in order to avoid the di&s;agreeable con&s;equences, which may be drawn from their doctrine.</P>
<P>Perhaps the phra&s;e, <HI>purgatory,</HI> may be deemed invidious; but there can be no word which will expre&s;s the idea of a &s;tate of purgation more conci&s;ely. It is a phra&s;e, adopted by the church of Rome, to point out a &s;ituation &s;imilar to that upon which wicked men (according to our oppo|nents) enter at death. "It is," &s;aith cardinal Bellarmine, "a certain place, in which, as in a pri&s;on, tho&s;e &s;ouls are purged, after this life, which were not fully purged in it; that being &s;o purged, they may be able to enter into hea|ven, into which no unclean thing can enter." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Locus quidam, in quo, tanquam in carcere, po&s;t hanc vitam, purgantur animae, quae, in hac, non plen&eacute; purgatae fue|runt; ut nimirum &s;ic purgatae, in coelum ingredi valeant, qu&oacute; nihil intrabit conquinotum. <BIBL><HI>Pellarm. de purgator.

this definition agrees with the ideas of the univer|&s;ali&s;ts, they, and we, mu&s;t judge for our&s;elves.</P>
<P>This purgatory mu&s;t be a new &s;tate of probation, or only a &s;tate of temporary puni&s;hment. If it is con&s;idered as another &s;tate of probation, the con&s;equence will imme|diately follow, that, let a man live as he may; let him neglect every religious and moral duty; let him live and die ever &s;o abandoned; it will have no effect upon his eternal happine&s;s, becau&s;e he is to enter upon another &s;tate, in which he &s;hall have opportunity to rectify the mi&s;takes committed in this, and &s;ecure his eternal felicity. This &s;trikes at the root of &s;ociety, and hath a tendency to deprive men of &s;ome of the mo&s;t &s;alutary re&s;traints, which deter them from acts of outrage and wickedne&s;s. It is a con&s;equence, which our opponents them&s;elves, do not love &s;hould follow.</P>
<P>But whatever con&s;equences might follow from it, yet, if it was a &s;cripture doctrine, we ought to embrace it, and leave con&s;equences with him, who is able to take care of them. But this is not the ca&s;e: the &s;criptures, on the contrary, lead us to con&s;ider the pre&s;ent, as a &s;tate of exi&s;tence, in which our characters are to be form|ed for eternity: that the pre&s;ent, is the only time, in which we can &s;ecure an intere&s;t in the go&s;pel &s;alvation: that if we let &s;lip this opportunity, the door will be &s;hut upon us, and we &s;hall be finally excluded from all title to go&s;pel benefits. The &s;ame &s;criptures repre&s;ent death, as putting an end to our opportunities of doing, and getting good: we are charged, <HI>what&s;oever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wi&s;dom, in the grave, whither thou goe&s;t.</HI> Eccl. ix. 10. Our &s;tate of exi&s;tence beyond the grave, is re|pre&s;ented as a &s;tate of inactivity, with re&s;pect to the &s;al|vation of our &s;ouls; as the place <HI>where no man can work.</HI> One of the principal arguments, to excite us to exertion in the concerns of our &s;ouls, urged in the word of God, is that drawn from the pre&s;ent's being the only time for us to do &s;o, and our immediate entrance, at death, upon a &s;tate of fixed happine&s;s, or mi&s;ery. We are no where told, that we &s;hall have opportunity to repent, believe, and perform good works, after death: it is no where &s;aid,
<PB N="45" REF="018207_0043_0FA5BC6D179E0540">
that, let us mi&s;take as we may now, we &s;hall have oppor|tunity to rectify it hereafter: but it is po&s;itively &s;aid, <HI>It is appointed unto all men once to die, and after death is the judgment.</HI></P>
<P>We all agree, that it is lawful to pray for tho&s;e who are in a &s;tate of probation: but if &s;ouls are &s;o after death; if they are not finally fixed in weal or woe, why may not we fall to praying for the dead; praying, either that they may be pre&s;erved through the next &s;tate of probation, or &s;peedily delivered from the pains and penalties of pur|gatory? But this would &s;mell too &s;trongly of old mother church.</P>
<P>If we view this purgatory as a &s;tate of temporary pu|ni&s;hment, to be certainly &s;ucceeded by an eternity of glory and happine&s;s, we &s;hall con&s;ider the damned in hell, as in the &s;ame &s;ituation with good men here upon earth: they are enduring affliction and di&s;tre&s;s, in order to qualify them the better for glory and happine&s;s: they may, with the highe&s;t propriety, adopt the language of the apo&s;tle, and &s;ay, 2 Cor. iv. 17, 18. <HI>For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; while we look not at the things which are &s;een, but at the things which are not &s;een: for the things which are &s;een, are temporal,</HI> (or temporary); <HI>but the things which are not &s;een, are eternal.</HI> They mu&s;t view their pre|&s;ent puni&s;hment, as nece&s;&s;ary to their future happine&s;s: they may &s;ubmit to it with great patience, becau&s;e they know it to be temporary; and may look beyond it, with ineffable tran&s;port, to an eternity of happine&s;s and glory. The&s;e &s;ame motives &s;upport good men, under the &s;ufferings of human life; &s;o that &s;aints in this world, and &s;inners in hell, in the next, will be in the &s;ame &s;ituation: the latter, indeed, will have one great advantage&mdash;they are &s;ure of heaven at la&s;t: they may pa&s;s their &s;tate of &s;uffering with great content, becau&s;e they have a full a&s;&s;urance of eternal life; while many precious &s;aints of God, upon earth, go mourning, all the day long, under doubts and uncertain|ties, as to their future &s;tate.</P>
<P>The&s;e ab&s;urdities follow, upon the doctrine of a purga|tory. And, indeed, when we once take up our foot from the doctrine of eternal puni&s;hment, we know not where to
<PB N="46" REF="018207_0044_0FA5BC6F079715B0">
&s;et it down; we know not of what nature, or duration, the puni&s;hment of the wicked will be: indeed, we know not that they will have any at all; for much more may be &s;aid, with probability, to prove, that they &s;hall be annihi|lated, than that they &s;hall be &s;ubject only to a temporary puni&s;hment.</P>

<HEAD>IMPROVEMENT.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. We are led, by the pa&s;t &s;ubject, to admire and adore the holine&s;s and &s;overeignty of the great God.</P>
<P>The holine&s;s of God is manife&s;ted, in his excluding, for over, from his pre&s;ence, all &s;uch as re&s;olutely per&s;i&s;t in &s;in. This di&s;covers, how incompatible it is with his nature: he cannot endure the &s;ociety, nor will he permit the happi|ne&s;s, of &s;uch as <HI>love darkne&s;s rather than light.</HI> He gives them all a &s;pace for repentance: but if they will not make u&s;e of it; if they will de&s;pi&s;e free and rich mercy; if they will cleave to their own iniquity; he hath &s;worn, that they &s;hall <HI>never enter into his re&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>God, my brethren, is a &s;overeign agent: he doth his plea&s;ure in heaven above, and upon earth beneath: we are all entirely in his hands: we cannot, with effect, re&s;i&s;t his will, nor &s;et a&s;ide his purpo&s;es. We may here rea&s;on as we plea&s;e. We may, in the fulne&s;s of our pride, and our ignorance, declare, that one thing is right for God to do, and another wrong: we may &s;ay, that one thing is con&s;i&s;tent with his mercy, and another is incon|&s;i&s;tent: but when we have done all, he will di&s;po&s;e of us as he &s;eeth to be right and be&s;t. Poor, contemptible worms of the du&s;t, as we are, we cannot alter a &s;ingle purpo&s;e of his, relating to us; nor prevent it from being carried into execution, a &s;ingle moment. If <HI>he</HI> &s;ees it right, to &s;entence us to eternal mi&s;ery, neither angels, men, nor devils, can prevent the execution. We may feel rage, and enmity, again&s;t the God that made us; but the expre&s;&s;ions of it will return upon our&s;elves, and increa&s;e, in&s;tead of alleviating, our mi&s;ery. Let us always re|member, that God is in heaven, and we upon earth; and therefore it becomes us, that our words &s;hould be few.</P>
<P N="2">2. We di&s;cern the rea&s;on we have to be thankful for Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="018207_0045_0FA5BC6F42C7CEA8">It is certain, that we cannot entertain too exalted ideas of the obligations we are under to Chri&s;t, our redeemer. But perhaps nothing hath a more natural tendency to en|large the&s;e, than a reflection upon our ruined, deplorable &s;tate, without him. It is &s;aid, that we cannot have com|plete ideas of happine&s;s, without viewing its oppo&s;ite mi|&s;ery: &s;urely, then, our pa&s;t &s;ubject will repre&s;ent the happine&s;s enjoyed by the &s;aints, and purcha&s;ed by Chri&s;t, in the &s;tronge&s;t point of light, as it paints the mi&s;ery of &s;inners in &s;uch vivid colours. <HI>Glory be to God in the high|e&s;t; on earth, peace and good will to man.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Let the pa&s;t &s;ubject make us afraid of &s;in.</P>
<P>It is to be lamented, that mankind are no more under the influence of ingenuous principles; that a &s;en&s;e of kindne&s;s and obligation hath no more effect upon them. But it is the fact, that we are not thankful as we &s;hould be; and that our conduct is not governed by gratitude, and affection, &s;o much as it is by hope or fear.</P>
<P>But, as this is the ca&s;e, we have rea&s;on to be thankful, that the&s;e latter motives are &s;et before us, in &s;uch a &s;trong and powerful light, in the word of God. Sin is our bane: &mdash;it is our mi&s;ery in this world, and, unrepented of, will be our ruin in the next. It is well for us, therefore, that &s;uch terrors, as the pa&s;t &s;ubject pre&s;ents, are brandi&s;hed before our eyes. We are warned, and cautioned, to flee from the wrath to come; a&s;&s;ured that we may e&s;cape it, if we will apply to the only Saviour.</P>
<P>Let us, then, fear &s;in. Let us dread tho&s;e principles and practices, which will provoke God to anger here, and expo&s;e us to eternal vengeance hereafter. Nothing is &s;o truly pernicious to us, or ought &s;o much to be dreaded by us, as offending the great God, and thus ruining our own &s;ouls. And it is truly amazing, that we have no more &s;en&s;e of the evil of &s;in now, and the con&s;equences of it hereafter, that we can play, as it were, upon the brink of ruin, and &s;port our&s;elves with that mi&s;ery, which is &s;hortly to overtake the impenitent. Had we but a realizing &s;en&s;e of that puni&s;hment, which &s;in will meet with, in the world to come; did we but feel the worth of our &s;ouls, and the weight of an eternity, we &s;hould not dare to trifle, as we do now, with our deare&s;t intere&s;ts: we &s;hould flee from &s;in,
<PB N="48" REF="018207_0046_0FA5BC70E2B81790">
as from our utmo&s;t de&s;truction; we &s;hould turn a deaf ear to the &s;yren &s;ong of &s;inful plea&s;ure, and &s;hould give our fir&s;t and principal <HI>diligence, to make our calling and election &s;ure.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI> beware of indulging to any reflections, or em|bracing any &s;entiments, which have a tendency to dimi|ni&s;h your fear of &s;in. We are too in&s;en&s;ible, too little cau|tious of it now; we need not be le&s;s fearful of it. Tho&s;e who endeavour to make us view &s;in as an evil le&s;s perni|cious than it really is, will not do us any good. Their opinions are not friendly (to &s;ay no more) to the intere&s;ts of real religion, and the welfare of &s;ociety.</P>
<P N="4">4. Let us be cautioned again&s;t tho&s;e errors, which the pa&s;t &s;ubject hath been de&s;igned to refute.</P>
<P>The doctrine of univer&s;al &s;alvation is, in the highe&s;t degree, grateful to corrupt human nature; it flatters our pride; it favours our indolence; it takes off a re&s;traint from our gratifications; it calms our con&s;ciences; and hath a tendency to dimini&s;h, yea, to de&s;troy, our mo&s;t lively fears, as to futurity. This doctrine &s;inks into our hearts in&s;en&s;ibly; and is &s;o grateful to us, as that it <HI>will</HI> make a greater or le&s;s impre&s;&s;ion upon us.</P>
<P>This is a ground of caution to us; we are always ready to believe what we wi&s;h; we try to find it true; we give every thing, advanced in its favour, a partial hearing; while we turn a deaf ear to the arguments &s;ugge&s;ted again&s;t it. We know this to be the ca&s;e, not only in matters of religion, but al&s;o in things pertaining to this life.</P>
<P>But we are to remember, that our wi&s;hing things to be true, will not make them &s;o; nor if they are fal&s;e in their nature, will their convenience to us, make them true: yet our wi&s;hes and de&s;ires may, and will, have a great tendency to warp our judgment&mdash;to make us &s;hut our eyes again&s;t the light, and expo&s;e us to embrace error, in&s;tead of truth. When we have &s;omething within us, which whi&s;|pers, that its being true, will make us happy; and its be|ing fal&s;e, will render us mi&s;erable; we &s;hall, in almo&s;t every ca&s;e, believe, let it be ever &s;o glaringly ab&s;urd.</P>
<P>Let us apply this reflection to the &s;ubject before us. Let us be afraid of embracing &s;uch a lulling, fle&s;h-plea&s;ing doctrine. We wi&s;h it to be true, and this will be apt to make us believe it: we are partial in favour of what is
<PB N="49" REF="018207_0047_0FA5BC72E233A168">
&s;aid for it: we are prejudiced again&s;t what is produced to controvert it: we are liable, therefore, very liable to error; to fall in with it, though it be ever &s;o contrary to &s;cripture and rea&s;on.</P>
<P>It is to be wi&s;hed, that tho&s;e who have embraced this doctrine, would look into their hearts, and &s;eriou&s;ly exa|mine, whether their de&s;ires, or their needs, that it may be true, have not led them to fall in with it, and blinded their eyes to the plain dictates of their under&s;tanding and con|&s;cience. Let them remember, that it is for their &s;ouls, and eternity; and that a mi&s;take may be fatal to them.</P>
<P>And let tho&s;e of us, who are &s;earching for the truth, in this matter, always take this thought with us, and let it make us <HI>jealous over our&s;elves, with a godly jealou&s;y,</HI> le&s;t we be drawn away, and enticed, by our eager wi&s;hes and de&s;ires, to embrace an error, which may be fatal to us. Our hearts are deceitful, and wicked; they are <HI>apt to put &s;weet for bitter, and bitter for &s;weet;</HI> and to lead us into &s;uch errors, as flatter our pride, our avarice, and our &s;en&s;uality.</P>
<P>Let us remember, again, that to believe, and act under the fear of eternal puni&s;hment, or a&s;&s;enting to this doc|trine, and acting under the influence of it, is much &s;afer than the other way. If the &s;entiments of our oppo&s;ers are true, we are perfectly &s;afe, becau&s;e all will be happy at la&s;t: but what will become of them, if <HI>our</HI> &s;entiments are true? What if, when they come into the eternal world, they &s;hould find, that they are to be placed in weal or woe for ever, according as their character here hath been; and they have conducted as carele&s;sly as their doc|trine leads them to conduct? What a di&s;appointment! What horror and di&s;may, what inexpre&s;&s;ible angui&s;h, will the reflection, that it is too late to rectify the mi&s;take, oc|ca&s;ion to them! We could heartily with, that all the friends, favourers, and preachers of this doctrine, would &s;eriou&s;ly reflect upon this con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Religious controver&s;ies are not friendly to the intere&s;ts of real piety. Perhaps they injure it in no way more, than by introducing a &s;pirit of bitterne&s;s and rancour, of cen&s;ure and ra&s;h judging. Let us be careful again&s;t this &s;pirit, in the &s;ubject we have been upon. We may con|demn,
<PB N="50" REF="018207_0048_0FA5BC73BB98E1B8">
and reprobate the doctrine; but we have no right to condemn the men who hold it. Their hearts may be better than their heads; nay, we know they are &s;o; for not one of them lives, and conducts, &s;o wickedly as his religious tenets will admit him to do. Their con&s;ciences are too tender to be affected with their theories; and they live as well, perhaps, and &s;ome of them better, than their neighbours, who hold to the truth. Let this make us careful of judging, or cen&s;uring them:&mdash;to their own ma&s;ter, they &s;tand or fall! It is the command of Chri&s;t, <HI>judge not, that ye be not judged.</HI></P>
<P>La&s;tly. Let us all be exhorted to &s;trive, that we may avoid everla&s;ting mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>You will not, my brethren, view the pa&s;t &s;ubject as a mere que&s;tion of &s;peculation, controverted with a de&s;ign to gratify an inqui&s;itive mind, or gain a victory over its oppo&s;ers. Let us, on the contrary, bring home to our bo&s;oms, a &s;en&s;e of our per&s;onal intere&s;t in it. Let us re|alize, that you and I mu&s;t be eternally mi&s;erable, if we die with the weight of our &s;ins upon us, without pardon|ing grace and mercy.</P>
<P>We can have no adequate conception of the mi&s;ery, which the finally impenitent endure in hell: they are puni&s;hed to the utmo&s;t extent of their capacities: they experience the utmo&s;t exacerbation of angui&s;h. All is darkne&s;s, mi&s;ery, and de&s;pair around them! Hope, the la&s;t, the be&s;t companion of the mi&s;erable, hath now for|&s;aken them! They have nothing before them but accu|mulated angui&s;h; for the iron gates of a long eternity are &s;hut upon them, never to be opened!</P>
<P>Shudder, O my &s;oul, at the tremendous idea, and be quickened to <HI>flee from the wrath to come!</HI> Realize, that this is the fir&s;t, and mo&s;t important concern! What are all the fa&s;cinating plea&s;ures of time and &s;en&s;e; of what con|&s;equence are the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite guilty enjoyments, when compared with the <HI>one thing that is needful!</HI> Away, then, with delays, and de&s;igns, that interfere with this! <HI>Now</HI> may a bli&s;sful eternity be &s;ecured;&mdash;by and by it will be for ever too late! <HI>Now</HI> are propo&s;als of peace and pardon made;&mdash;by and by they will be offered no more!

&s;pirit, in a &s;ituation &s;o dangerous; but <HI>turn to the &s;trong hold, as a pri&s;oner of hope!</HI></P>
<P>Offers of deliverance from the mi&s;ery we have been de|&s;cribing, and of an entrance upon an eternity of felicity, are made to every one of us, in the go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t! No one is excluded from it; we are <HI>all</HI> invited to partake of it.

<P>Let us then, every one, renounce our &s;ins, and &s;ubmit our&s;elves to the teachings and guidings of the divine &s;pi|rit; that thus we may be made <HI>partakers of the divine na|ture;</HI> that <HI>our feet may take hold upon eternal life,</HI> and our &s;ouls be for ever happy, in the pre&s;ence of God&mdash;<HI>where is fulne&s;s of joys; and at his right hand, where are plea&s;ures for ever more.</HI></P>
