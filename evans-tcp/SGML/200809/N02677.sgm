<OPENER><SALUTE>Courteous Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have pre&s;ented thee with a &s;mall Volume, in which is contained much Truth, which may through the ble&s;&s;ing of God give thee great Satisfaction, if thou &s;earch the Scriptures diligently, and ask Wi&s;dom in Faith, of him who is the giver of <HI>every good and perfect Gift;</HI> without who&s;e help, I can pro|mi&s;e thee no profit.</P>
<P>The Matter I treat on, is about Gods Prede|&s;tination, Election, and Reprobation, according to his foreknowledge; and of the death of Chri&s;t for the Sons of Men. The Body and Sub&s;tance of all Objections I have laboured to an&s;wer, briefly and plainly, and that both by Scripture

and Rea&s;on, to the &s;atisfaction of all rational Men fearing God. And I am con&s;cious to my &s;elf before God, that I aim at nothing more, then the Glory of the great God, <HI>in whom we live, move, and have our Beings</HI>; and <HI>to whom we mu&s;t all give an account of all our Actions,</HI> at the great Day: and in the next place, at the good and benefit of all that &s;hall read or hear the holy Scriptures, and by them try the&s;e following Lines. They are &s;o few, that thou may&s;t ea&s;ily purcha&s;e them; and if thou finde&s;t no profit in them, it will be but three or four Pence lo&s;t: but if they prove pro|fitable to thee, it will be very well be&s;towed.</P>
<P>The Times are now drawing nigh, in which the Lord him&s;elf will appear from Heaven, to take an account of every Man, how they have &s;pent their talents of wi&s;dom and under&s;tand|ing which he hath lent them: &amp; happy will eve|ry Man be, that can give up his account with joy, can &s;ay with <HI>Paul,</HI> that they have <HI>labour|ed to have con&s;ciences void of offence to|wards God &amp; towards all Men;</HI> and <HI>walk|ed in all the Ordinances and Command|ments of the Lord blamele&s;s</HI>: the which while &s;ome Men are labouring after, I find them drowned and lo&s;t in a labyrinth about Prede&s;tination, Election, and Reprobation;

<HEAD>The Order of Cau&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Scripture &s;aith, <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.4. &s;peaking of Gods Election, that <HI>he hath cho&s;en us in him, before the foundation of the world, that we &s;hould be holy and without blame before him in love</HI> &amp;c. and <HI>Peter</HI> al&s;o, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.2. calleth the Saints <HI>Elect, according to the fore-know|ledge of God the Father through Sanctification of the Spi|rit, unto obedience,</HI> &amp;c. and <HI>Paul</HI> (2 <HI>The&s;&s;.</HI> 2.13) &s;aith to the Saints, that <HI>God hath from the beginning cho|&s;en them to &s;alvation, through &s;anctification of the Spirit, and belief of the truth, whereunto he called you by our Go&s;pel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>From all which places we mu&s;t needs conclude, that God hath cho&s;en &s;ome to life and glory, e|ven before or from the foundation of the world, becau&s;e the Scripture &s;aith it; <HI>and</HI> (as Chri&s;t &s;aith in another ca&s;e) <HI>the Scripture cannot be broken.</HI> Therefore the wi&s;dom of all Chri&s;tians is, To la|bour to have judgements informed according to the Scriptures, and that the Scriptures, and their Judgements may &s;peak both one thing: and to
<PB N="2" REF="003171_0005_0FEFFB58A0D9DDC8">
that end, Let us con&s;ider the manner of Gods &s;peaking to the &s;ons of men.</P>
<P><HI>Rom.</HI> 4.17. He faith to our Father <HI>Abraham, As it is written, I have made thee a father of many na|tions, before him whom he believed, even God, who quick|neth the dead, and calleth things that are not as though they were,</HI> &amp;c. Ob&s;erve, God &s;peaks then in that pre&s;ent time to <HI>Abraham,</HI> &s;aying, <HI>I have made thee a Father of many Nations,</HI> notwith&s;tanding <HI>A|braham</HI> was not the Father of one Child at that time, but <HI>I&s;hmael:</HI> &s;ee <HI>Gen.</HI> 17.5. how then mu&s;t we under&s;tand, <HI>I have made thee a Father of many Nati|ons</HI>?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> The Apo&s;tle telleth us plainly, <HI>Rom</HI> 4.17. that it was &s;o before God, who <HI>calleth things that are not, as though they were:</HI> and &s;o he calleth <HI>Abraham</HI> the Father of many Nations, though he was not as yet; no not the Father of <HI>I&s;aac, in whom his &s;eed &s;hould be called.</HI></P>
<P>The like may again be ob&s;erved when he cal|led Chri&s;t <HI>a Lamb &s;lain from the foundation of the World,</HI> Rev. 13.8. yet he was not &s;lain many thou|&s;and years after</P>
<P>Therefore the &s;ame may again be con&s;idered about Gods Election from the foundation of the world, thus:</P>
<P>God calleth <HI>Abraham, a Father of many Nations,</HI> though not &s;o; God calleth Chri&s;t, <HI>a Lamb &s;lain from the foundation of the Wourld,</HI> though not &s;lain many thou&s;and years after, till he was a man in the fle&s;h: even &s;o he calleth men elected from the foundation of the world, though not elected many
<PB N="3" REF="003171_0005_0FEFFB58A0D9DDC8">
thou&s;and years after, till they are men in the fle&s;h: yet it is all &s;o, and done before God, who fore&s;e|eth and knoweth all things, even from eternity to eternity; and therefore <HI>calleth things that are not as though they were:</HI> for he &s;eeth the beginning and end of all mens actions, whether good or evil, at once; and knowing as well from the foundation of the world what men would do in their generations, as they can know when their lives and actions are fini&s;hed. He therefore could as well conclude of mens &s;alvation or damnation then, as men can know them&s;elves at the end of their days, or at the day of Judgment.</P>
<P>By all which it is clear, that as Chri&s;t was called <HI>a Lamb &s;lain from the foundation of the World,</HI> and yet not &s;lain nor touched till the day of his death: &s;o al&s;o, although God calleth men Elect from the foundation of the world, yet they are not Elect nor cho&s;en, until the very day of their conver|&s;ion and turning from &s;in to God: for God <HI>calleth things that are not as though they were</HI>: from whence it is evident they were not Elect, although &s;o called.</P>
<P>Again, if we con&s;ider Election according to the foreknowledge of God, it is plain from that text in 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1, 2. <HI>Elect according to the foreknowledge of God, through &s;anctification of the Spirit, unto obedience.</HI> From whence I rea&s;on thus:</P>
<P>If the Elect are cho&s;en through the &s;anctifi|cation of the Spirit, then they were not cho|&s;en before they had the Spirit, and were &s;anctified by the Spirit.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="003171_0006_0FEFFB5B074F3740">But they had not that &s;anctifying Spirit before they had a being, either in the World, or el&s;e in their Mothers Womb at lea&s;twi&s;e.</P>
<P>Therefore not cho&s;en from the foundation of the World, but only as afore&s;aid.</P>
<P>Again, 2 The&s;&s;. 2.13. <HI>We are hound to give thanks alway to God for you, Brethren, beloved of the Lord, becau&s;e God hath from the beginning cho&s;en you to &s;alvation, through &s;anctification of the Spirit, and belief of the truth, whereunto you were called by our Go&s;pel.</HI> From whence I argue thus:</P>
<P>If the Saints are <HI>cho&s;en to &s;alvation through &s;ancti|fication of the Spirit, and believing of the truth,</HI> and were <HI>called to believe that truth by the bear|ing of the Go&s;pel</HI>; then they were not cho&s;en before they had believed the truth, and be|fore they did hear the Go&s;pel, by which they were called to believe.</P>
<P>But they were cho&s;en through believing the truth, and called to believe it by the Go&s;pel, as afore&s;aid; and <HI>Faith cometh by hearing,</HI> Rom. 10.17.</P>
<P>Therefore not cho&s;en before <HI>they</HI> had a being, no more than Chri&s;t was &s;lain before <HI>he</HI> had a being.</P>
<P>For according to the Scripture they were <HI>cho&s;en through &s;anctification of the Spirit, and belief of the truth</HI>: and if through it, then not without it (ob|&s;erve that&punc;) but it is through it, therefore not without it. Moreover, they were called to this Faith <HI>by the Go&s;pel</HI>; which they never heard be|fore they had a being.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="003171_0006_0FEFFB5B074F3740">Therefore it is clear, their Election was not before their Conver&s;ion, though God &s;aw it before: neither indeed can it be, becau&s;e the E|lect are all <HI>cho&s;en in Chri&s;t, Eph.</HI> 1.4. but I can prove that tho&s;e very Elect <HI>Ephe&s;ians</HI> were once out of Chri&s;t, <HI>Chap.</HI> 2.11, 12. <HI>Remember</HI> (&s;aith the Apo&s;tle) <HI>that at that time ye were without Chri&s;t, Hope, without God in the world</HI>: From whence I argue thus:</P>
<P>If at that time they <HI>were without God,</HI> and <HI>with|out Chri&s;t,</HI> then at that time they were not in him: for they could not be without him and within him both at one time: and if not in Chri&s;t, then <HI>not cho&s;en in him,</HI> as all rational Men will grant. From all which I conclude,</P>
<P>That Men were elected in Chri&s;t, according to the Scripture, yet never in him, before they believed in him: and they never believed in him, before they heard the Go&s;pel: and they never heard the Go&s;pel before they were born. There|fore not Elected, though &s;o called by <HI>God who ju&s;tifieth the ungodly,</HI> and <HI>calleth things that are not, as though they were.</HI></P>
<P>Again, how plain is it <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.11, 12. where <HI>Paul</HI> &s;aith, that <HI>they whom God did prede&s;tinate ac|cording to the coun&s;el of his own will, to be to the prai&s;e of his glory,</HI> were &s;uch as did fir&s;t <HI>tru&s;t in Chri&s;t</HI>: and in ver. 13. he &s;aith, that <HI>they tru&s;ted in Chri&s;t after they heard the word of truth, the Go&s;pel of their salvation</HI>; (not before) the which they never heard before they were born, all Men will grant that have but rea&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="003171_0007_0FEFFB5D5B7B2800">Again, how clear is that text, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.2. <HI>Elect according to the foreknowledge of God:</HI> whence it is plain, if God <HI>knew them,</HI> before he <HI>Elected them,</HI> then he knew them as Men in the fle&s;h, and not as they were nothings: and if he knew them as they were Men, they mu&s;t needs be born fir&s;t; for of nothing, nothing can be known before time, nor cho&s;en in time. Therefore I conclude, that the real and ab&s;olute act of Election comes to pa&s;s in time, though known of God before time, who according to his foreknowledge <HI>calleth things that are not as though they were</HI>; and &s;o calleth Men that are not Elected as though they were Elected.</P>
<P>And thus is the great Objection about Gods Election an&s;wered, and the &s;tumbling-block ta|ken away, to the end that Men might <HI>work out their &s;alvation with fear and trembling,</HI> and <HI>make their Calling and Election &s;ure.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ame may al&s;o be con&s;idered of Gods prede&s;tination, or fore-appointing all obedient Believers to Life and Salvation, (not without, but) <HI>according to his foreknowledge</HI> of all their words and actions <HI>from the foundation of the World.</HI> And &s;o likewi&s;e he prede&s;tinateth or fore appointeth all di&s;obedient Unbelievers and Apo&s;tates to Death and Damnation (not without, but) <HI>accor|ding to his foreknowledge</HI> of all their words and actions, <HI>from the foundation of the world.</HI></P>
<P>Thus I do believe that God fore&s;aw all Men and things, pa&s;t, pre&s;ent and to come, at once, at once: I do believe that God fore&s;aw <HI>Adams</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="003171_0007_0FEFFB5D5B7B2800">
Fall long before he was a creature in being; for nothing is hid from his eyes, but <HI>all things are naked and bare before him with whom we have to do,</HI> Heb. 4.13.</P>
<P>But it may be &s;ome will &s;ay, <HI>If God did fore|know</HI> Adam <HI>would fall when he had created him, why then did he make him</HI>?</P>
<P>To which I an&s;wer two things: fir&s;t, what have we to do to reply again&s;t our Maker? <HI>&s;hall the thing formed &s;ay to him that formed it, Why ha&s;t thou made me thus</HI>? Shall <HI>Adam</HI> &s;ay to his Maker, Why ha&s;t thou made me thus [&s;ubject to fall?] What is that to <HI>Adam,</HI> &s;eeing God hath given him and his po&s;terity means to ri&s;e again to a good or a better condition, and the neglect of that means is that which will ri&s;e up in Judgment again&s;t all &s;lothful di&s;obedient ones that will not make u&s;e of their talents of power, wi&s;dom and under&s;tand|ing which God hath given them, to work out their Salvation with fear and trembling while they may? This well con&s;idered, will give light into <HI>Rom.</HI> 9.10, 11, 20, 21, 22. and if Men will needs under&s;tand that God loved <HI>Jacob</HI> and hated <HI>E&s;au</HI> before they were born, they &s;hould con&s;ider that God knew them both before they were born and after they were born [alike] according to his foreknowledge, as afore&s;aid.</P>
<P>But I know that this is brought to prove <HI>that Gods Election is not becau&s;e of works fore&s;een.</HI></P>
<P>To which I an&s;wer; but what works? It is true, God doth not chu&s;e us becau&s;e of any works of righteou&s;ne&s;s that we have done, or can do,
<PB N="8" REF="003171_0008_0FEFFB5F20049C08">
out of Chri&s;t; for out of him no works are ac|cepted: therefore it is &s;aid, <HI>Not of works, le&s;t any Man &s;hould boa&s;t:</HI> therefore no works are re|quired of unbelievers, but the very <HI>prayers of the wicked are an abomination to the Lord</HI>: but it is be|cau&s;e of works of righteou&s;ne&s;s that Chri&s;t him|&s;elf hath wrought for us, in his own per&s;on; and doth work by us and in us, by his Spirit, when we are Believers. And though boa&s;ting in the works of the Law, and boa&s;ting of works before believing be reproved; yet <HI>Paul</HI> &s;aith, <HI>As the truth of Chri&s;t is in me, no Man &s;hall &s;top me of that boa&s;|ting,</HI> 2 Cor. 11.10. and although he cried down works before faith in &s;o many places, yet he preacheth up works after believing, loud enough, in the&s;e words. <HI>Tit.</HI> 3.8. <HI>This a faithful &s;aying, and the&s;e things I will that thou con&s;tantly affirm, That they which have believed in God might be careful to main|tain good works; for they are good and profitable,</HI> &amp;c. and Phil. 2.12, 13. <HI>Work out your &s;alvation with fear and trembling: for it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do, of his own good plea&s;ure.</HI> Thus we may &s;ee, that al|though it be not for our workings without Chri&s;t, that we are cho&s;en or prede&s;tinated to life and glory; yet it is by our workings with Chri&s;t, when he by his Spirit dwelleth in our hearts by believing, and is <HI>in us the hope of glo|ry:</HI> for then he worketh in us, and our works are acceptable, becau&s;e he works them by us, and we work them in him. Therefore <HI>Paul</HI> &s;aith, <HI>We therefore as workers together with him, be&s;eech you,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="003171_0008_0FEFFB5F20049C08">Therefore if Men would but open their eyes, they might ea&s;ily &s;ee what works the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks of, when he &s;aith Election is <HI>not of works.</HI> But of this more plainly anon.</P>
<P>Secondly, I an&s;wer: Although God &s;aw <HI>Adam</HI> would fall, yet he &s;aw him a Creature fir&s;t, or el&s;e he could not have for&s;een he would fall when he was a Creature: therefore <HI>God is the God of order, and not of confu&s;ion,</HI> 1 Cor. 14.33. and fore-&s;eeth all things orderly, and not con|fu&s;edly.</P>
<P>So then I conclude, that fir&s;t he &s;aw <HI>Adam</HI> created.</P>
<P>Secondly, He &s;aw him fallen, and all his Po&s;terity in his loyns.</P>
<P>Thirdly, He &s;aw Chri&s;t crucified for them.</P>
<P>Fourthly, He fore&s;aw the Go&s;pel preached to all Men in their Generations.</P>
<P>Fifthly, He fore&s;aw all Mens receiving, or refu&s;ing; believing, or not believing; obeying, or di&s;obeying his Go&s;pel, in their &s;everal Ge|nerations, as it was, is, or &s;hall be communica|ted to the end of all ages in order at once. And &s;eeing as well then, what Men would do in their Ages and Generations to come, as they do know them&s;elves when their Lives and Actions are fini&s;hed, God could thereupon make up his Election and Reprobation, chu&s;ing or electing obedient Believers, according to his foreknow|ledge to Life and Salvation; and refu&s;ing and
<PB N="10" REF="003171_0009_0FEFFB618607F5E8">
reprobating di&s;obedient Unbelievers, to eternal Death and Damnation.</P>
<P>And thus is Election and Reprobation to be con&s;idered, according to the foreknowledge of God in Chri&s;t, or out of Chri&s;t from the foun|dation of the World, according to the Scrip|tures. Which if well con&s;idered, it would put an end to all the confu&s;ed and di&s;tracted thoughts in Men about the&s;e things.</P>
<P>But it may be that &s;ome will yet object, <HI>that I hold faith and obedience in us, to be the cau&s;e of Gods electing or chu&s;ing us to Life and Glory.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> That Faith in Chri&s;t, and Obedience to Chri&s;t, is [<HI>a cau&s;e</HI>] without which God chu|&s;eth none to Life and Salvation, I affirm, becau&s;e we never read that God cho&s;e any di&s;obedient Unbeliever to Life and Glory which lived and died &s;o: but that it is [<HI>the cau&s;e</HI>] for which he doth chu&s;e any, I &s;hall utterly deny, and &s;hew the contrary, in the Order of Cau&s;es, thus:</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e I &s;hould affirm my obedience to be the cau&s;e of my Election to Salvation, then what is the cau&s;e of my obedience?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> My love to Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>But what is the cau&s;e of my love to Chri&s;t?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> My faith in Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>But what is the cau&s;e of my faith in Chri&s;t?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> The preaching of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that <HI>he died for my &s;ins, and ro&s;e again for my ju&s;tification,</HI> without which there could be no believers: for take away Chri&s;t, &amp; take away faith; and then believe who can.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="003171_0009_0FEFFB618607F5E8">But what is the cau&s;e of the preaching of the Go&s;pel to us?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> Chri&s;ts dying for us.</P>
<P>But what is the cau&s;e of Chri&s;ts dying for us?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> Even Gods great love of pity wherewith he loved us even <HI>when we were dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins,</HI> Eph. 2.4. at that time <HI>he commended his love towards us, in that while we were yet &s;inners Chri&s;t died for us,</HI> Rom. 5.8.</P>
<P>Thus all Men may &s;ee, that I do not hold that God cho&s;e any to Life and Salvation for any good in them, before he put it in them; as I &s;hall make it appear more large, by the Scriptures, con|&s;idering the cau&s;es in order, de&s;cending from God to us, or a&s;cending from us to God.</P>

<P>Gods love to the &s;ons of Men, as they were &s;inners again&s;t him, and enemies to him, was the cau&s;e of his &s;ending his Son to die for &s;inners, for his <HI>enemies, for the ungodly, for the unju&s;t</HI>; as ap|peareth by the&s;e following Scriptures: <HI>John.</HI> 3.16. <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.6, 8, 10. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3.18. <HI>God &s;o loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, that who|&s;oever believeth in him, &s;hould not peri&s;h, but hvae e|verla&s;ting life. For when we were yet without &s;trength, in due time Chri&s;t died for the ungodly.</HI> And, <HI>God commendeth his love to us, in that while we were yet &s;inners Chri&s;t died for us. For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much wore being reconciled we &s;hould be &s;a|ved by his life. For Chri&s;t al&s;o hath &s;uffered for

<P>Thus are the cau&s;es of Gods Election and Mans Salvation laid down in order, &s;o clearly that the meane&s;t capacity may under&s;tand them: which more briefly are thus:</P>
<P N="1">1. Gods love was the cau&s;e of his &s;ending his Son to die for &s;inners.</P>
<P N="2">2. Chri&s;t dying for &s;inners, and ri&s;ing again for their ju&s;tification, is the cau&s;e of the Go&s;pels preaching.</P>
<P N="3">3. The preaching of the Go&s;pel is the cau&s;e of our believing.</P>
<P N="4">4. Our believing is the cau&s;e of our ju&s;tifica|tion from &s;in.</P>
<P N="5">5. The knowing our &s;elves ju&s;tified from &s;in by the blood of Chri&s;t, is the cau&s;e of our love to Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="6">6. Our love to Chri&s;t is the cau&s;e of our o|beying of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="7">7. Our obeying of Chri&s;t is the cau&s;e of his be|coming the author of eternal Salvation to us, and all them that obey him.</P>
<P>Now if we con&s;ider the cau&s;es in order from us to God, it is as clear, beginning at the la&s;t.</P>
<P N="7">7. Our obedience is the cau&s;e of our &s;alvation.</P>
<P N="6">6. Our love is the cau&s;e of our obedience.</P>

<P N="4">4. Our believing is the cau&s;e of our ju&s;tification.</P>
<P N="3">3. The preaching of the Go&s;pel is the cau&s;e of our faith.</P>
<P N="2">2. Chri&s;t's Death and Re&s;urrection, is the cau&s;e of the Go&s;pels preaching.</P>
<P N="1">1. Gods love is the cau&s;e of &s;ending his Son to die for us.</P>
<P>Thus it appears, that it is <HI>not for any works of Righteou&s;ne&s;s that we have done,</HI> but of his love and mercy he &s;aved us, by &s;ending a Saviour, <HI>Tit.</HI> 3.4, 5. From all which, the&s;e following things are con&s;iderable, and ought to be con&s;idered of all that de&s;ire to fear God aright.</P>
<P N="1">1. There was a nece&s;&s;ity of Gods love in &s;end|ing his Son to die for us; without which, he had not come to die, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 4.10.</P>
<P N="2">2. There was a nece&s;&s;ity of Chri&s;ts love in dying for us; without which, the Go&s;pel could not be preached, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.3, 4.</P>
<P N="3">3. There was a nece&s;&s;ity of the Go&s;pels being preached; without which, there could have been no believing, <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.14, 15, 17.</P>
<P N="4">4. There is a nece&s;&s;ity of our believing the Go&s;pel; without which, we cannot be ju&s;tified from our Sins by Faith in the blood of Chri&s;t: <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.25.</P>
<P N="5">5. There is a nece&s;&s;ity of our being ju&s;tified by Faith in the blood of Chri&s;t; without which,
<PB N="16" REF="003171_0012_0FEFFB6931F22200">
we cannot come to know that he <HI>loved us, and wa&s;hed us from our &s;ins in his own blood,</HI> Rev. 1.5.</P>
<P N="6">6. There is a nece&s;&s;ity of our knowing his love wherewith he fir&s;t loved us; without which, we cannot love him again: For, <HI>we love him, be|cau&s;e he loved us fir&s;t,</HI> 1 John 4.19.</P>
<P N="7">7. There is a nece&s;&s;ity of our loving Chri&s;t who loved us fir&s;t; without which, we cannot keep his Commandments: For, <HI>this is love that we keep his Commandments; and his Commandments are not grievous,</HI> 1 John 5.3.</P>
<P N="8">8. There is a nece&s;&s;ity of out keeping his Commandments, and obeying his voice; with|out which, we cannot inherit the promi&s;es, nor be heirs of eternal life. For, <HI>Chri&s;t is become the Author of eternal &s;alvation to all tho&s;e that obey him.</HI> Heb. 5.9. And, <HI>ble&s;&s;ed are they which do his Com|mandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and enter in through the gates into the City,</HI> Rev 22.14. And, <HI>we have need of patience, that after we have done the will of God, we might inherit the promi&s;es,</HI> Heb. 10.36 <HI>for the doors of the Lord's work are ble&s;&s;ed in their deeds,</HI> Jam. 1.25. <HI>But tho&s;e that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, he will render indignation and wrath; tribulation and angui&s;h upon every Soul of Man that doth evil.</HI> And, <HI>Tho&s;e which will not hear him</HI> (even Chri&s;t, <HI>that great Prophet</HI>) <HI>in all things what&s;oever he &s;hall &s;ay unto them, &s;hall be de|&s;troyed from among his People with an everla&s;ting de|&s;truction from the pre&s;ence of God, and from the glory of his power, when he &s;hall come in flaming fire, to

render vengeance on them that know not God, and obey not the Go&s;pel of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> See Rom. 2.8, 9. Act. 3.22, 23. 2 The&s;&s;. 1.7, 8, 9.</P>
<P>By all which we &s;ee, that there is as great a ne|ce&s;&s;ity of our keeping the Commandments and Ordinances of Chri&s;t, as there was of Gods &s;end|ing his Son to die for us, and as there was of Chri&s;ts dying for our &s;ins, and ri&s;ing again for our ju&s;tification: for, without faith in Chri&s;t, and obedience to Chri&s;t, there is no promi&s;e of life and &s;alvation by Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>All which may &s;erve &s;harply to reprove three &s;orts of People.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Tho&s;e which are ignorant and know not Chri&s;t nor his commands, what they are; and are contented with their ignorance, and think to make that a cloak for their &s;ins.</P>
<P>Secondly, Tho&s;e which are carele&s;s, and when they know God, and Chri&s;t, and his command|ments, will not do them, but pre&s;ume upon mercy and &s;alvation without obeying of Chri&s;t. The&s;e are tho&s;e which think to be &s;aved by Faith only, without doing the will and work of God in their generation; the which <HI>James</HI> calleth <HI>vain Men,</HI> James 2.14, 17, 20. &s;aying, <HI>What doth it profit if they have faith and not works? Can faith &s;ave them? But wilt thou know, O vain Man, that faith without works is dead? was not</HI> Abraham <HI>our father ju&s;tified by works, when he had offered up his Son</HI> I&s;aac? <HI>See&s;t thou not how faith wrought with his works, and by works was his &s;aith made perfect.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="003171_0013_0FEFFB6AD58C7EA8">Thirdly, It &s;erves to reprove tho&s;e mo&s;t &s;harply, who after they have known the truth, and walk|ed therein, having <HI>ta&s;ted the good word of God,</HI> and found it &s;weet and plea&s;ant to their &s;ouls, and have had their hearts ravi&s;hed with the <HI>powers</HI> and con&s;olations <HI>of the world to come; if they fall away, and turn from the holy Commandment once deli|vered to them, their latter end will be wor&s;e than their beginning.</HI> And <HI>it had been better for them they had never known the way of truth:</HI> for they chiefly &s;hall be puni&s;hed. 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21. <HI>For in them is fulfilled the true proverb: The dog is turned to his own vomit a|gain, and the &s;ow that was wa&s;hed to her wallowing in the mire,</HI> ver&s;. 22.</P>
<P>But it may be &s;ome will yet &s;ay, <HI>All this is no|thing to many thau&s;ands in the world, that never hear of God nor Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>To which I an&s;wer with the words of <HI>Paul, Rom.</HI> 10.18. <HI>But have they not heard? yes verily: their &s;ound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world.</HI> And again, <HI>Act.</HI> 26.26. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;aith, He was per&s;waded that <HI>none of tho&s;e things were hidden; for it was not done in a corner.</HI> And certain it is, that the knowledge of God is manife&s;t throughout the world. For <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 19. <HI>The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firma|ment &s;heweth his handy-work: day unto day uttereth &s;peech, and night unto night &s;heweth knowledge:</HI> And, <HI>There is no language nor &s;peech where their voice is not heard.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="003171_0013_0FEFFB6AD58C7EA8">Object. But it may be &s;ome will &s;ay, <HI>But what knowledge is this?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> I an&s;wer with <HI>Paul, Rom.</HI> 1.19, 20. <HI>That which may be known of God is manife&s;t in them: for God hath &s;hewed it unto them. For the invi&s;ible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly &s;een, being under&s;tood by the things that are made</HI>; [<HI>even</HI>] <HI>his eternal power and Godhead: &s;o that they are without excu&s;e.</HI> Now if all know enough to leave them without excu&s;e, then the Di&s;pute is at an end. Notwith&s;tanding it is yet further re|markable, That as we hear there is a People in the other parts of the world, which wor&s;hip Idols, or the Sun, Moon, and Stars; yea, that wor&s;hip the Devil: &s;o al&s;o tho&s;e People do as well hear that there is a People in this part of the world which wor&s;hip God and Chri&s;t; and do as fami|liarly call us Chri&s;tians, as we call them Hea|thens.</P>
<P>Again, all that wor&s;hip any thing for a God, do by that acknowledge that there is a God: and all that offer &s;acrifice to a God, do by that confe&s;s there is a God offended, or may be offended, and is reconcilable by &s;acrifice: and it is apparent, that <HI>tho&s;e which have not the Law are a Law to them&s;elves,</HI> as <HI>Paul</HI> &s;aith, Rom. 2.14, 15. <HI>which &s;hew the work of the Law written in their hearts, their con&s;cience al&s;o bear|ing them witne&s;s, and their thoughts the mean while accu&s;ing or el&s;e excu&s;ing one another; In the day when God &s;hall judge the &s;ecrets of all Men by Chri&s;t Je&s;us</HI> [according to my Go&s;pel,] &s;aith <HI>Paul,</HI> ver&s;. 16.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="003171_0014_0FEFFB6DD0C25438">And thus are all cavils of this nature ea&s;ily an|&s;wered, and all Men left without excu&s;e.</P>
<P>Having thus briefly gone thorow Prede&s;tination and Election according to the forekowledge of God: I &s;hall now &s;peak a word or two about Chri&s;ts death, and the offer of grace by his death to the &s;ons of Men.</P>
<P>The main que&s;tion is, <HI>Whether Chri&s;t died for all, or but for &s;ome?</HI></P>
<P>To which I &s;hall an&s;wer by the Scriptures, &s;hewing, 1. the te&s;timony of all the Prophets: 2. of the Angel of God: 3. of Chri&s;t him&s;elf: 4. of the holy Apo&s;tles of our Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah,</HI> Chap. 53.4, 5, 6. &s;aith thus: <HI>Surely he hath born our griefs and carried our &s;orrows: yet we did e&s;teem him &s;tricken, &s;mitten of God, and afflicted. But he was wounded for our tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, he was brui&s;ed for our iniquities, and the cha&s;ti&s;ements of our Peace was upon him: and with his &s;tripes we are healed. All we like &s;heep have gone a&s;tray: we have every one turned to his own way: and the Lord hath laid on him the ini|quities of us all.</HI> Thus <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> &s;heweth plainly, that the iniquities of all tho&s;e that went a&s;tray, were laid upon Chri&s;t. And to him the te&s;ti|mony of all the other Prophets agreeth. <HI>Acts</HI> 10 43. <HI>To him give all the Prophets witne&s;s, that through his name who&s;oever believeth in him, &s;hall receive remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins.</HI> The &s;ame &s;aith that great Prophet <HI>John Bapti&s;t,</HI> John 1.7. <HI>who came to bear
<PB N="21" REF="003171_0014_0FEFFB6DD0C25438">
witne&s;s of the light, that all Men through him might believe.</HI> And again, <HI>ver.</HI> 29. <HI>Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the &s;ins of the world.</HI> Thus have all the Prophets, with one con&s;ent, te&s;tified, that God laid upon Chri&s;t the iniquities of all that are gone a&s;tray, that he was the Lamb of God that taketh away the &s;in of the world, that all Men through him might believe; and that through his name who&s;oever believeth in him, &s;hould receive remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins.</P>
<P>Likewi&s;e the Angel of God te&s;tifieth <HI>(Luke</HI> 2.10) the &s;ame things in effect, &s;aying, <HI>Fear not; for I bring you glad tidings of great joy, which &s;hall be to all people:</HI> which was, <HI>that there was born un|to them, that day in the City of</HI> David <HI>a Saviour, which was Chri&s;t the Lord.</HI> By all which it &s;till appeareth, that Chri&s;t died for <HI>all Men,</HI> or el&s;e it could not be glad tidings of great joy to <HI>all peo|ple,</HI> but rather &s;ad tidings to all tho&s;e for whom he died not, if there were any &s;uch.</P>
<P>And now we come to the words of Chri&s;t him&s;elf, who knew his own bu&s;ine&s;s better than any Man el&s;e: and therefore if his te&s;timony a|greeth with tho&s;e that have gone before, we mu&s;t needs be convinced that it is a truth. For which, &s;ee <HI>John</HI> 3.14, 15, 16. in the&s;e words: <HI>As</HI> Mo&s;es <HI>lifted up the &s;erpent in the Wilderne&s;s, even &s;o mu&s;t the Son of Man be lifted up, that who&s;oever believeth in him, &s;hould not peri&s;h, but have ever|la&s;ting life: For God &s;o loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that who&s;oever believeth in him &s;hould not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting life,</HI> &amp;c.
<PB N="22" REF="003171_0015_0FEFFB6FCA29C6B0">
<HI>For God &s;ent not his Son to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be &s;aved.</HI> Thus we &s;ee the words of Chri&s;t agree with the words of the Prophets: Therefore it mu&s;t needs be ow|ned for a truth, that Chri&s;t died for all as afore|&s;aid.</P>
<P>And now we &s;hall hear what the Apo&s;tles &s;peak concerning this thing, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.14, 15. <HI>The love of Chri&s;t con&s;traineth us, becau&s;e we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all once dead; and that he died for all, that they which live &s;hould not henceforth live to them&s;elves, but to him that died for them and ro&s;e again.</HI> And <HI>Paul</HI> &s;aith, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2.5, 6. that <HI>there is one God, and one Medi|ator between God and Man, the Man Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who gave him&s;elf a ran&s;ome for</HI> [<HI>all</HI>] <HI>to be te&s;tified in due time.</HI> From whence the Reader may do well to con&s;ider, that if we may under&s;tand the Scripture as it is written, that there is one God and one Mediator; &s;o al&s;o we may under&s;tand from the &s;ame Scripture, that the &s;ame Mediator gave him&s;elf in due time a ran&s;ome for all. Again, <HI>Paul</HI> &s;aith in the &s;ame Epi&s;tle, <HI>Chap.</HI> 1.15. that <HI>it is a faithful &s;aying, and worthy of all accep|tation, that Chri&s;t came into the world to &s;ave &s;inners, of whom</HI> Paul <HI>was the chief.</HI> Whence I conclude, If he came to &s;ave the chief of &s;inners, then &s;urely he left none without a Saviour, and means of &s;alvation. Again he &s;aith to <HI>Titus,</HI> Chap. 2.11. that <HI>the grace of God that bringeth &s;alvation to all Men, hath appeared.</HI> And <HI>Heb.</HI> 2.9. <HI>That he by the Grace of God &s;hould ta&s;te death for every Man.</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="003171_0015_0FEFFB6FCA29C6B0">
And 1 <HI>John</HI> 2.2. that <HI>he is the propitiation for our &s;ins; and not for ours only, but al&s;o for the &s;ins of the whole world.</HI> And <HI>Chap.</HI> 4.14. he &s;aith (&s;peak|ing of him&s;elf and the re&s;t of the Apo&s;tles) <HI>We have &s;een and do te&s;tifie, that the Father &s;ent the Son to be the Saviour of the world.</HI></P>
<P>Thus we have the te&s;timony of all the Prophets, the Angel of God, Chri&s;t the Lord him&s;elf, &amp; all his holy Apo&s;tles, agreeing together in one, to prove, that Chri&s;t died for all Mankind; and by him grace, mercy, and eternal life, is offered to all, and the wor&s;t of &s;inners.

<P>That the Lord laid upon him the iniquities of all that went a&s;tray, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 53.6. that he gave him|&s;elf as a ran&s;om in due time for all Men, yea, the chief of &s;inners. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2.6. <HI>chap.</HI> 1.15. that he by the grace of God ta&s;ted death for every Man, <HI>Heb.</HI> 2.9. that he is the propitiation for our &s;ins, and not for ours only, but al&s;o for the &s;ins of the whole world, 1 <HI>John</HI> 2.2. that the Fa|ther &s;ent the Son to be the Saviour of the world, 1 <HI>John</HI> 4.14. that he is the Lamb of God which taketh away the &s;in of the world, that all Men through him might believe, <HI>Job.</HI> 1.7, 29. and to him give all the Prophets witne&s;s, that through his name who&s;oever believeth in him &s;hall receive remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins, <HI>Acts</HI> 10.43. and Chri&s;t te&s;tifieth of him&s;elf, that God &s;o loved the world, that
<PB N="24" REF="003171_0016_0FEFFB716FC752C0">
he gave his only begotten Son, that who&s;oever believeth in him &s;hould not peri&s;h, but have e|verla&s;ting life, <HI>John</HI> 3.16. and this is glad ti|dings of great joy to all people, <HI>Luke</HI> 2.10.</P>
<P>And thus the plea&s;ant harmony of Scriptures, out of the mouths of &s;o many faithful witne&s;&s;es which none dare deny, mu&s;t needs make &s;weet melody in the hearts of all true believers.</P>
<P>But now it remaineth for me to &s;peak to tho&s;e Objections which are u&s;ually brought again&s;t the&s;e Scriptures. To which I &s;hall give a brief, yet (through the help of the Lord, I hope. a) &s;atisfactory An&s;wer. And to that end I &s;hall &s;um them all up into four heads, thus:</P>
<P>The common Objections are rai&s;ed again&s;t the word [<HI>all Men,</HI>] and the word [<HI>every Man,</HI>] the word [<HI>world,</HI>] and the word [<HI>whole world.</HI>] Which are managed thus: that Chri&s;t died for [<HI>all</HI>] the [<HI>Elect</HI>] for [<HI>every</HI>] one of the Elect, for the [<HI>world</HI>] <HI>of</HI> [<HI>believers,</HI>] or the [<HI>whole</HI>] <HI>world of the</HI> [<HI>Elect</HI>]</P>
<P>To which I an&s;wer: That Chri&s;t died for the Elect, I freely grant, becau&s;e he died for <HI>all Men, every Man,</HI> and <HI>the whole world</HI> as afore&s;aid: but that he died for the Elect as they were Elect, or becau&s;e they were Elect, I utterly deny, and will &s;hew the contrary by the Scriptures anon. But fir&s;t I will con&s;ider the Objections, whether they ari&s;e naturally from the Scriptures or no: which will appear thus:</P>
<P>If the Scripture no where &s;peaks of <HI>a world of Believers</HI> and Elect Per&s;ons, then we have
<PB N="25" REF="003171_0016_0FEFFB716FC752C0">
no ground to believe that Chri&s;t died for a world of believers and Elect per&s;ons.</P>
<P>But the Scripture no where &s;peaks of a &s;uch a world:</P>
<P>Therefore we have no ground to believe Chri&s;t died for &s;uch a world.</P>
<P>Nay, the Scriptures are &s;o far from calling be|lievers and Elect per&s;ons a <HI>world,</HI> that they are oppo&s;ed again&s;t the world; as appeareth by the words of Chri&s;t, <HI>John.</HI> 15.19. <HI>If ye were of the World, the World would love his own: but becau&s;e ye are not of the World, but I have cho&s;en you out of the World, therefore the World hateth you.</HI></P>
<P>But now if we &s;hould grant the&s;e Men their Argument, it would de&s;troy their own principle, which is, <HI>That none of the Elect can peri&s;h.</HI> But that &s;ome that Chri&s;t died for may peri&s;h, is evi|dent in the&s;e words of <HI>Paul; And &s;o &s;hall thy weak brother peri&s;h for whom Chri&s;t died,</HI> 1 Cor. 8.11. But if Chri&s;t died for none but the world of E|lect, as they &s;ay, then &s;ome of the Elect may pe|ri&s;h. And thus their folly is manife&s;t. There|fore I &s;hall now &s;hew by the Scriptures what world Chri&s;t died for, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.6. <HI>When we were yet without &s;trength, in due time, Chri&s;t died for the ungodly,</HI> ver. 8. <HI>But God commendeth his love to|wards us, in that while we were yet &s;inners Chri&s;t died for us.</HI> ver. 10. <HI>For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more being reconciled we &s;hall be &s;aved by his life.</HI> From all which we clearly &s;ee, that Chri&s;t died for the world of ungodly, and for the world
<PB N="26" REF="003171_0017_0FEFFB7403AF8310">
of &s;inners, and for the world of his enemies, yea for the world of unju&s;t, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3.18. <HI>For Chri&s;t al&s;o&punc; hath once &s;uffered for &s;ins, the ju&s;t for the un|ju&s;t, that he might bring us to God.</HI> But the Elect, as Elect, are not unju&s;t: for <HI>who &s;hall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? It is God that ju&s;tifieth, who is he that condemneth?</HI> &amp;c. See <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.33, 34. Therefore he died not for the Elect, as or becau&s;e they were Elect, but even for the world that <HI>John</HI> &s;peaks of, when he &s;aith, <HI>We know we are of God, and the whole World lyeth in wickedne&s;s,</HI> 1 <HI>John</HI> 5.19.</P>
<P>Obj. But the Saints and tho&s;e that &s;hall be &s;a|ved were once &s;inners as well as others. <HI>Eph.</HI> 2.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> But that was not as they were Elect in Chri&s;t, but as they were reprobates, or void of judgment concerning the faith, out of Chri&s;t, without God, without hope, yea enemies in their minds by evil works: See <HI>ver&s;.</HI> 1, 2, 3, 11, 12, 13. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all which hath been the condition of the be&s;t of Gods people, until they be ju&s;tified by faith, and <HI>made nigh by the blood of Chri&s;t:</HI> for <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles</HI> are all under &s;in, and every mouth &s;topped, &amp; all the world guilty before God, until they be &s;et free by believing in the blood of Chri&s;t. See <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.19, 20, 21 22, 23, 24, 25. Therefore to affirm that Chri&s;t died for the Elect, or believers, as they were, and becau&s;e they were Elect and believers, is ab&s;olute non&s;ence: as I &s;hall now prove, thus,</P>
<P>They which hold that God intended to &s;end his Son to die only for the world of believers, mu&s;t
<PB N="27" REF="003171_0017_0FEFFB7403AF8310">
al&s;o of nece&s;&s;ity hold that there was a world of believers before God intended to &s;end his Son &s;o die; and they were the cau&s;e of Gods &s;ending his Son.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> If there was a world of believers before God intended to &s;end his Son to die, then I pray tell me, 1. what they believed; and 2. whom they believed in, before there was a Chri&s;t inten|ded for them; and I am &s;atisfied: but till then, I mu&s;t needs conclude it is ab&s;olute non&s;ence and confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Again, they which believe that Chri&s;t was &s;ent to die only for a world of Elect, mu&s;t al&s;o needs conclude that there were a world of Elect before God intended to &s;end his Son to die.</P>
<P>To which I an&s;wer: Tho&s;e which are Elect, are <HI>cho&s;en in Chri&s;t,</HI> Eph 1.4. and out of him there is no Election: therefore if there was a world of Elect before God intended a Chri&s;t to die for the Elect, I pray tell me, 1. who were they E|lected in, 2. and what they were Elected unto: otherwi&s;e I mu&s;t needs conclude as afore&s;aid, (namely) that &s;uch rea&s;oning is without &s;ence and without Scripture.</P>
<P>But to end the controver&s;ie, I &s;hall commit the&s;e following things to the con&s;ideration of all rational Men fearing God.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Scripture faith, that <HI>Chri&s;t came to &s;eek and to &s;ave that which was lo&s;t,</HI> Luke 19.10.</P>
<P>But the Elect, as they bear the name of Elect, are not lo&s;t, but a found and &s;aved People, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.18. 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.9. <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 64.5.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="003171_0018_0FEFFB765EE3D258">Therefore he died not for the Elect, as or becau&s;e they were Elect; for that had been to &s;eek and &s;ave that which was found and &s;aved before.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Scripture &s;aith, that <HI>he came not to call the righteous, but &s;inners to repentance,</HI> Mat. 9.13.</P>
<P>But the Elect are <HI>all righteous,</HI> I&s;a. 60.21. Chap. 26.1, 2. Luke 1.6. <HI>Zacharias and Eliza|beth were both righteous before God,</HI> and <HI>he that doth righteou&s;ne&s;s is righteous,</HI> 1 John 3.7.</P>
<P>Therefore Chri&s;t died not for the Elect as they were, and becau&s;e they were Elect and righte|ous: neither could he; for <HI>there is none righteous, no not one</HI>; until they be made righteous by faith in Chri&s;t: See <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.10, with <HI>Chap.</HI> 4.5. for then he had come to call them to repentance and righteou&s;ne&s;s, that had repented and were righteous before.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Scripture &s;aith, that <HI>in due time Chri&s;t died for the ungodly,</HI> Rom. 5.6.</P>
<P>But the Elect are not ungodly: for <HI>God hath cho&s;en to him&s;elf the Man that is godly,</HI> P&s;al. 4.3.</P>
<P>Therefore Chri&s;t died not for the Elect, as or becau&s;e they were Elect; for that had been to redeem them by his blood that were redeemed before.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Scripture &s;aith, that <HI>Chri&s;t died for the unju&s;t, that he might bring them to God,</HI> 1 Pet. 3.18.</P>
<P>But the Elect are not unju&s;t, but a ju&s;tified people: and <HI>who &s;hall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect?</HI> for <HI>it is God that ju&s;tifieth, who then &s;hall condemn?</HI> Rom. 8.33, 34.</P>
<P><PB REF="003171_0018_0FEFFB765EE3D258">Therefore Chri&s;t died not for the Elect, as Elect; for that had been to ju&s;tifie them that were ju&s;t before, and to bring them near to God that were near before.</P>
<P N="5">5. The Scripture &s;aith, that <HI>he came to preach deliverance to the captives.</HI></P>
<P>But the Elect are not Captives and Pri&s;oners under Satan, but &s;et at liberty by Chri&s;t, and are his Soldiers, and do fight the Lords Battles again&s;t Sin, the World, and the Devil; <HI>&s;tanding fa&s;t in that liberty wherewith Chri&s;t hath made them free.</HI> See Eph. 6.11, 12. with 2 Tim. 2.3, 4. Gal. 5.1.</P>
<P>Therefore Chri&s;t died not for the Elect, as or becau&s;e they were Elect: that had been to &s;et them at liberty, that were at liberty before.</P>
<P N="6">6. The Scripture &s;aith that he came to give &s;ight to the blind, and light to them that fit in darkne&s;s, <HI>Luke</HI> 4.18. with <HI>Mat.</HI> 4.16.</P>
<P>But the Elect are not in darkne&s;s, nor yet blind; but, <HI>ble&s;&s;ed are their eyes for they &s;ee,</HI> Mat. 13.16. and they are all <HI>the children of the light,</HI> and <HI>of the day,</HI> 1 The&s;&s;. 5.4, 5.</P>
<P>Therefore Chri&s;t died not for the Elect, as or becau&s;e they were Elect; for that had been to give light to them which had light before, and to open the eyes of them which &s;aw before.</P>
<P N="7">7. The Scripture &s;aith (<HI>Eph.</HI> 2.5, 12.) that <HI>he quickned them that were dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins</HI>; &s;uch as <HI>in times pa&s;t were without Chri&s;t, aliens from the common wealth of I&s;rael, and &s;trangers from
<PB N="30" REF="003171_0019_0FEFFB782EA94448">
the covenant of promi&s;e; having no hope, without God in the World.</HI></P>
<P>But the Elect are not dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins, but alive in Chri&s;t, and <HI>their life is hid with Chri&s;t in God:</HI> neither are they without Chri&s;t; for they are <HI>cho&s;en in him</HI>: nor &s;trangers and fo|reigners to the Common-wealth of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and Covenant of Promi&s;es: but they are <HI>fellow citizens with the Saints, and of the hou&s;hold of God,</HI> Eph. 2.19. and are <HI>made nigh by the blood of Chri&s;t,</HI> ver&s;. 13. neither are they without hope; for their faith and hope is in God, and they have <HI>put on hope as an helmet of &s;alvation,</HI> 1 <HI>The&s;&s;.</HI> 5.8.</P>
<P>Therefore Chri&s;t died not for the Elect, as they were Elect, nor becau&s;e they were Elect: for that had been to quicken them that were a|live before, to bring them into Covenant that were in Covenant before, to make them near to God by his blood that were near before. And thus, by the&s;e Mens account, the Lord Chri&s;t lo&s;t his labour of love, and accompli&s;hed a &s;olemn nothing.</P>
<P>And thus have I &s;hewed plainly by the Scrip|ture, and &s;ound Rea&s;on, that it is ab&s;olute Non|&s;en&s;e for any to &s;ay that Chri&s;t died for the E|lect, as they were, or becau&s;e they were Elect: Becau&s;e,</P>
<P N="1">1. That had been to &s;eek and &s;ave them that were found and &s;aved before.</P>
<P N="2">2. To call them to Repentance that had re|pented before.</P>

<P N="1">1. If Chri&s;t died not for all Men, then De|&s;pair is no &s;in in them that peri&s;h by it, &s;eeing there is not any thing for tho&s;e Men to believe unto &s;alvation, for whom Chri&s;t died not.</P>

<P N="4">4. Satan doth no evil in per&s;wading Men that Chri&s;t died not for them, but doth per&s;wade them to believe the truth, if it be true that Chri&s;t died but for &s;ome few of the world.</P>

<P N="7">7. If Chri&s;t died not for all Men, then it is a Vertue in &s;ome Men to be Unbelievers, and not to believe in Chri&s;t that he died for them, but rather to believe that he did not die for them: for if that be a truth, it is a Vertue to believe all truth: And then it followeth, that tho&s;e that believe that Chri&s;t died not for them, do as well as they which believe Chri&s;t did die for them, &s;eeing both are true; and it is as much Vertue to believe one truth as another.</P>

vanities, and &s;o for&s;ook their own mercies, and denied the Lord that bought them, and brought upon them&s;elves &s;wift de&s;truction: and becau&s;e they received not the love of the truth that they might be &s;aved, therefore (if you would know wherefore) God gave them up to &s;trong delu&s;ions to believe Lies, that they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had plea&s;ure in unrighteou&s;ne&s;s. See <HI>Prov.</HI> 1.24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32. 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.1, 2. 2 <HI>The&s;&s;.</HI> 2.10, 11, 12.

proved already at large; and <HI>He that &s;pared not his only Son, but delivered him up for us all: how &s;hall he not with him give us all things?</HI> Rom. 8.32. and his hand is &s;tretched out all the Day long to a &s;tiff-necked gain&s;aying People. What Man is there that knoweth not, that if he make u&s;e of all the Will, Power, and Under&s;tanding that God hath given him, the Lord will double his talent and give him more? And that the Lord have given all Men enough to leave them without ex|cu&s;e, I have already proved in the former part of the Book; and if any Man would have more, they mu&s;t improve that which they have faith|fully, for <HI>he that is faithful in that which is lea&s;t, will be faithful al&s;o in much: but he that is unju&s;t in the lea&s;t will al&s;o be unju&s;t in much</HI>: Luke 16.10.

<P>I an&s;wer, What &s;hould hinder them if they be willing? for fir&s;t, <HI>God is not willing that any &s;hould peri&s;h.</HI> Secondly, <HI>God is willing that all Men &s;hould come to the knowledge of the truth, and he &s;aved.</HI> 2 Pet. 3.9 1 Tim. 2.4. and Chri&s;t is willing, for <HI>he came not to judge the world, but to &s;ave the world</HI>: and how did he weep over <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI>? and <HI>how oft</HI> (as afore&s;aid) <HI>would he have gathered them toge|ther as a Hen doth her Chickins? but they would not.</HI>

And now what hinders Mens &s;alvation, but that &s;ame, [<HI>they would not?</HI>] Con&s;ider well, and judge.</P>
<P>Obj. <HI>But it is not in him that willeth, nor in him that runneth; but in God that &s;heweth mercy,</HI> Rom. 9.16.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> Very well: then it &s;eemeth by that Scripture that Men have freewill to be &s;aved; and indeed I wonder what Man alive de&s;ires not to be &s;aved: but it &s;eems their willing and running in their own ways will not attain it: it was not <HI>Cain</HI>'s &s;acrifice, nor the Scribes and Phari&s;ees long prayers and fa&s;tings with disfigured faces, nor yet their giving alms to the poor, and Tythes of all they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, that could give any of the&s;e a Man&s;ion in Heaven: (and why?) <HI>Becau&s;e they &s;ought it not by faith, but by the works of the Law,</HI> Rom. 9.30, 31, 32. and &s;o it is to this day; Men would with <HI>Balaam,</HI> gladly die the death of the righteous; and O who would not be &s;aved! but then they &s;hould come at Chri&s;ts call, and turn at his reproof, and wait for his coun&s;els who is the wonderful Coun&s;ellor, and live to him that died for them, walking in all the Commandments and Ordinances of Chri&s;t blamele&s;s, hearing him in all things what&s;oever he &s;hall &s;ay to them, and follow him where&s;oever he go; and when they have done all this with a good con&s;ci|ence, be contented to bear the reproaches and &s;hame that belong to the Cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, and to have Men, yea wicked Men, and &s;ome devout and honourable Men and Women per&s;ecute and revile them, and &s;ay all manner of evil &s;ayings

on them fal&s;ly, for his name &s;ake, and indure all this patiently, with &s;uch a Spirit as can pray for the &s;alvation even of their wor&s;t enemies, as for their own Souls; as Chri&s;t, who when he had fulfilled all Righteou&s;ne&s;s, was numbered among&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, and crucified between two thieves, and at that time prayed for his enemies: When we can thus follow Chri&s;t, then happy are we, <HI>for the &s;pirit of God and of Glory doth re&s;t upon us.</HI> See 1 Pet. 4.12, 13, 14, 15. and the greater is our reward in heaven, for in like manner per&s;ecu|ted they the Prophets before us. But I confe&s;s this way is &s;o narrow, and this gate is &s;o &s;traight, that few can enter and walk therein, except they learn of Chri&s;t who is humble and meek, and then they will find re&s;t to their Souls; and by and through him who is the Door, they will go in and out and find pa&s;ture. See <HI>Mat.</HI> 5.10, 11, 12.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee that although it be not in him that willeth, nor in him that runneth in his own ways, and after the imaginations of his own heart; yet it is in him that will run in Gods ways, and follow Chri&s;t in his Commands and Ordinances where&s;oever he go: for it is in God that &s;heweth mercy, who hath indeed &s;hewed mercy unto &s;in|ners and the wor&s;t of &s;inners, in &s;ending his only begotten Son to die for them, to take away their &s;ins, to call them to repentance, to give them the knowledge of Salvation by the remi&s;&s;ion of their &s;ins through his [mercy,] yea, through the [ten|der mercy] of our God, whereby the Day-&s;pring from on high hath vi&s;ited us, to give light to them

that &s;it in darkne&s;s and in the &s;hadow of death, and to guide our feet in the way of peace, <HI>Luk.</HI> 1. who before did not know the way of peace.</P>
<P>Therefore now let all Men take heed how they &s;in again&s;t &s;uch rich mercy and free grace, as is offered to them, even to the wor&s;t of &s;inners, by the Lord in the Go&s;pel of Truth, (which is the glad tidings of our Salvation) le&s;t mercy ri&s;e up in judgment again&s;t them in the great day, and left they &s;in again&s;t that true Light that is come into the world to enlighten every Man, (which is Chri&s;t) who by his word and &s;pirit hath made known to the &s;ons of Men what&s;oever he &s;aw in the bo&s;om of the Father; yea, even the whole coun&s;el of God, which is nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation.
