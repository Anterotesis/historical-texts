<HEAD>The PREFACE To the READER.</HEAD>
<P>I Doubt not but a Variety of Cen&s;ures will be pa&s;s'd upon this Di&s;cour&s;e, and its Author, by tho&s;e who are di&s;affec|ted at the Work of GOD. Some may &s;ay, It can be nothing but Pride and Self-Conceit that engages a Youth to appear in Print: Or perhaps they will &s;ay, <HI>Raw Novice;</HI> or, How knoweth this Man Letters? Others may &s;ay, I pu&s;h the Matter a little too far in many Things; that my Doctrine is too har&s;h; and may call it a Piece of Railery. But neither &s;o do their Witne&s;&s;es agree; for if the Doctrine be too grating and galling to the Generality of Mankind, how then can I expect to rai&s;e my Reputation, and gratify by Pride, by making it publick? And tho' I do &s;o with <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> De&s;ire of and Love to tho&s;e who oppo&s;e them&s;elves; yet they will be ready to conclude, that it proceeds from Pa&s;&s;ion and Rage. But let the Reader carefully ob&s;erve the Chap|ter Arguments are chiefly founded; and &s;ee whether the &s;ame Objection might not have been made to our LORD by the Phari&s;ees, when he rea&s;oned with them upon the &s;ame Subject. And I &s;hould in vain look for a better Reception than he met with, from the &s;ame Ranks of Per&s;ons, if I deal faithfully with them. Yet I mu&s;t not forbear. It may lea&s;e GOD to make it u&s;eful to &s;ome. I would earne&s;tly recommend a &s;erious Peru&s;al of that Book, entitled, <HI>The fulfilling of the Scriptures,</HI> to &s;uch as call this a <HI>New Scheme.</HI> I am per&s;waded, that a new Impre&s;&s;ion of &s;aid Book might be very &s;erviceable to the pre&s;ent Age: It is <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">revely and judiciou&s;ly written.</P>

I need make no other Apology for the Method or Stile of this Sermon, but only, that it is better to be under&s;tood by all, than admired by any. However 'tis not generally &s;o flat as to be nau&s;eous. I hold it a good Rule, to judge of any Treati&s;e from the Notions which the Strain thereof &s;eems naturally to convey and in&s;ill; and not from &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters"> defencele&s;s Expre&s;&s;ions, or Sentences dropt by the by. But there is a Club lately formed, who call them&s;elves <HI>Queri&s;ts,</HI> that &s;eem plea&s;ed with the contrary. Method: If they c<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> find on unguarded Word or Sentence, they pre&s;ently deduct a Doctrine from it, which the Author's general Strain ca<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> prove was never by him intended. When a figurative Ex|pre&s;&s;ion, in a Book to them di&s;plea&s;ing, will bear a fix Wittici&s;m, or &s;atyrical Jeer; if it cannot be call'd <HI>un&s;ound Doctrine,</HI> they will make it <HI>horrid Non-&s;en&s;e;</HI> and &s;ometimes &s;trive to perplex Things that are plain enough; and &s;eem de&s;irous to per&s;wade the World, that &s;uch forced Meanings are the Author's Principles. Thus they have dealt by Mr. <HI>Whitefield;</HI> and thus they may, perhaps, deal by this Sermon. For many will hate and contradict, what they are unable to confute. But the Reader may &s;ee, what a perver&s;e Way of Rea&s;oning at would be, to affirm that a Kingdom is weak, becau&s;e there are &s;ome depopulated Villages in it: Yet after this Manner do the <HI>Queri&s;ts</HI> rea&s;on. I can truly &s;ay, that it is an un|plea&s;ing Ta&s;k to me, thus to cen&s;ure any: But the Nece&s;&s;ary of it, in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, is plain, <HI>viz.</HI> That none may be impos'd on to think a Book is con&s;uted, when &s;ome Expre&s;|&s;iens are cen&s;ured in the of re&s;aid Manner. Either let the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> is fied Per&s;ons ra&s;e the Foundation on which I have built: or, if that cannot be done, let them &s;how, that the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">per&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> there is not built upon the Foundation.

There is one Thing further I would ob&s;erve to the Reader, <HI>viz.</HI> That Religion has frequently been traduc'd by its Ene|<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ies, as the procuring Cau&s;e of common Calamities: And accordingly, &s;ome of our Oppo&s;ers do invidiou&s;ly &s;peak after this Manner; <Q>That the Mi&s;ery of an hard Winter has been &s;ent upon the Land as a ju&s;t Judgment for &s;uch a <HI>Devili&s;h Work</HI> as has been among&s;t us.</Q> I mention this the rather, becau&s;e it is exactly parallel to a Calumny which <HI>Heathen</HI> Oppo&s;ers ca&s;t upon <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI> in the primitive Ages. When a &s;ore Famine was in the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, they boldly &s;poke to this Purpo&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>That <HI>the GODS</HI> (for &s;uch was their Dichect) <HI>had &s;ent the Famine as a Puni&s;hment on account of the</HI> Chri|&s;tians;</Q> and hence they thought it Ju&s;tice to &s;acrifice them, and appea&s;e their angry Deities by utterly de&s;troying the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Race. By &s;uch Sugge&s;tions the Devil &s;irives to imbitter the World again&s;t the Power of Godline&s;s: We are not ignorant of his Devices. <HI>Wo to the Inhabitants of the Earth, for the Devil is come down with great Wrath, becau&s;e he knows his Time is &s;hort.</HI> No doubt he will ere long, upon &s;ome &s;uch Pretence, per&s;wade his Servants that it is not fit &s;uch Follows as we &s;hould live. For thus has he always done. Oh that GOD may convince Oppo&s;ers who rea&s;on thus! For, if they per&s;i&s;t, they will find to their &s;ad Experience, that GOD will &s;end, not only tem|poral Calamities, but eternal Woes, on tho&s;e who continue to de&s;pi&s;e his Work: And will <HI>give his Witne&s;&s;es Power to &s;mite the Earth with all Plagues, as often as they will.</HI> Rev. <HI>xi. 6.</HI> And that not becau&s;e of the Progre&s;s of vital Piety, but for the Contempt and Rejection of it: Tho' the ungodly World, as they wre&s;t the Scriptures, &s;o al&s;o they wre&s;t the Providences of GOD, to their own De&s;truction. Thus were the <HI>Jews</HI> infatuated to interpret all the Progno&s;ticks of their final De&s;olation, as Tokens of their compleat Victory.</P>

<P>But if I ca&s;t out Devils by the Spirit of GOD, then the Kingdom of GOD is come unto you.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_MY Brethren, If we look back into the Hi&s;tory of the Church, we may &s;ee that CHRIST's Coming to it has not been &s;o clear and evident, as not to be mi&s;taken and rejected, even by his own profe&s;&s;ing People; <HI>He came to his own, and his own received him not.</HI> Joh. I. 11. And becau&s;e this is the very Hinge whereon our Eter|nal Happine&s;s turns, every one mu&s;t &s;ay, that it con|cerns us all to &s;tudy the &s;ure&s;t and cleare&s;t Light in this Matter. It de&s;erves the mo&s;t &s;olemn and &s;erious Atten|tion; the mo&s;t calm and deliberate Con&s;ideration; the mo&s;t impartial and unprejudiced Examination: Becau&s;e it is an Affair of eternal Moment. It is no &s;leevele&s;s Errand I come to you about this Day; what I &s;peak, will be in Remembrance to all Eternity. I come to &s;peak for GOD, who is here pre&s;ent as a Witne&s;s of my Intentions, and a Judge of the Truth of my Doc|trine; and a Witne&s;s of the Reception you give it. In the Fear of this Great GOD let us both &s;peak and hear. And do not mi&s;take me, as if I were &s;peaking for my&s;elf. No; I a&s;k not your Silver or Gold; I value not your Applau&s;e or Di&s;prai&s;e; nor do I de&s;ire from a Party-Zeal, to wed you to an Opinion. I de&s;ire none,
<PB N="8" REF="004716_0005_100DCC8D32E01BE0">no not a Brother, to join with me herein, unl<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters"> be joined to JESUS CHRIST; or from a Pro&s;pect that be may be joined to him. For, my Principle is. That whoever are hypocritical Pretenders, either Mini&s;ters or People, will, &s;ooner or later, take Offence, and be a Di&s;honour, and a Wound to Religion, as <HI>Demas</HI> and <HI>Alexander.</HI> If you will mi&s;take me, to your own Lo&s;s it will be, and your Blood will be upon your own Heads; for I have endeavour'd to prevent it.</P>
<P>THE Occa&s;ion of the Words of my Text you will &s;ind by looking back to the 22. <HI>v.</HI> where is recorded a great Miracle wrought by our LORD, <HI>viz.</HI> Healing a Per&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by the Devil, blind and dumb: So evi|dent was it, that he both &s;pake and &s;aw; it could be no Delu&s;ion. In <HI>v.</HI> 23. is ob&s;erv'd the Effect of this on the Multitude; they were amazed, and &s;aid, <HI>Is not this the Son of</HI> David? They &s;eemed well affected, and ju&s;t ready to acknowledge this to be the Work of GOD, and to embrace CHRIST as the promi&s;ed <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> until the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> jumbled them all again. For, no doubt, they concluded, that if it were the <HI>Finger of GOD,</HI> &s;urely the pious <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> who knew the Law be&s;t, and expounded it to them, would not oppo&s;e it. And therefore they turn their Eyes from the Miracle to hear the angr<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Phari&s;ies.</HI></P>
<P>What could any think, but that this Miracle would have put 'em for ever to Silence, and have made even the Devil a&s;hamed to oppo&s;e what was &s;o evident? Or at lea&s;t have &s;atisfied the People about CHRIST, &s;o as they would not give Heed to the <HI>Phari&s;ees.</HI> But, from the following Hi&s;tory we find it did neither. For when the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> perceived the People's Readine&s;s to embrace JESUS as the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> they were afraid of the Con&s;e|quence; for they knew their Credit mu&s;t then &s;ink, perceiving that as many as were his <HI>wa<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters"> Adherents,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">, and their un&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">rching, l<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">gal, unpro|fitable,

And to prepo&s;&s;e&s;s, and imbitter the People effectually again&s;t him, they call him, <HI>This Fellow.</HI> A bitter Scoff, a &s;atyrical &s;eer, Mocking, Laughing at the Work of GOD, or its Promoters, calling it <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m</HI> or <HI>Fally,</HI> will readily turn carnal Hearts again&s;t it; and make 'em &s;hrink from it as a &s;hameful Thing. <HI>This Fel|low,</HI> &s;ay they, tho' 'tis true he has ca&s;t out a Devil, yet that will not prove him to be the Son of <HI>David;</HI> for the Devil him&s;elf can ca&s;t out Devils; do not think the more of him for that; for we can prove from the Scriptures that he is not the Son of <HI>David,</HI> and con|&s;equently he mu&s;t be an <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;tick Fellow,</HI> in League with the Devil, and to obtain the Applau&s;e of ignorant People, he gets the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Devil to ca&s;t out Devils. Oh how would this &s;hock the People, and rai&s;e their Aver&s;ion again&s;t CHRIST! to hear their own beloved Teachers painfully warn them again&s;t him as a <HI>Devili&s;h Fellow!</HI></P>
<P>And alas! thus it has been with many at this Day, when the Power of GOD has appear'd in the A&s;&s;emblies. They have been put into &s;ome Amazement, and &s;tunn'd about their own Ca&s;e; have entertain'd a favourable Opinion of the Work of GOD, until they have heard other Mini&s;ters &s;peak again&s;t it; and by their Means, and the Devil's Temptations, joined with the Plague of an un&s;anctified Heart, have not only been jumbled, and turn'd from it, but have turn'd actually again&s;t it. They who to-day cry <HI>Ho&s;anna,</HI> to-morrow, when im|bitter'd by the Chief Prie&s;ts, cry, <HI>Crucify him.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>v.</HI> 25. we have our LORD's Reply in Vindi|cation of his Work from the fal&s;e and malicious A&s;per|&s;ions of his Oppo&s;ers. And hence his Amba&s;&s;adors are taught to do the &s;ame Thing; to ju&s;tify his Work, tho' they &s;hould thereby ca&s;t Contempt on all the Mini&s;ters on Earth. Why then, will any make it an Objection

Therefore, after CHRIST's Example I ought to vindicate his Work; nay, there is a Wo to me if I do not, tho' it &s;hould co&s;t me my Life; tho' it &s;hould be to the everla&s;ting Di&s;grace of all that oppo&s;e it, whether Mini&s;ters or People, Friends or Enemies, Relations or Strangers.

<P>Our LORD refutes the <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> 1. From the <HI>Incon&s;i&s;teney of their Argument with human Policy.</HI> For whoever has a Kingdom, and de&s;ires to pre&s;erve it, would certainly take the mo&s;t probable Means for that End: And &s;ince the Safety of a Kingdom con&s;i&s;ts in the Unity of its Members, con&s;equently the Contrary tends to its Overthrow. For if it were divided again&s;t it&s;elf, it would de&s;troy it&s;elf by inte&s;tine Broils, and become an ea&s;y Prey to a foreign Enemy. Now, as <HI>Satan</HI> has a Kingdom, &s;o he has Policy enough to pre&s;erve it, and his Malice again&s;t GOD and Mankind is not le&s;&s;en'd. But if he would forcibly ca&s;t out Devils in Confirmation of a Doctrine directly &s;abver&s;ive of his Kingdom, &s;urely we mu&s;t think he has forgot his Poli|cy, has laid a&s;ide his Malice, is divided again&s;t him&s;elf, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;et for the Reformation of Hell, and con&s;equently his Kingdom cannot long continue.</P>

Tho&s;e who have been greatly re|formed in Externals, and afterwards turned openly Profane, are a Proof of this. Be&s;ides the Apo&s;tle teaches us the &s;ame Thing, in <HI>Eph.</HI> ii. 3. while he puts him&s;elf, and others who were then Chri&s;tians, in the &s;ame Rank with the wor&s;t of Sinners, before their Conver&s;ion.

<P>Now, &s;ince the&s;e are the Evidences of a Soul po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed of <HI>Satan;</HI> the contrary Characters mu&s;t be engraven on it by the Spirit of GOD, when <HI>Satan</HI> is ca&s;t out.</P>
<P>And hence we may the more ea&s;ily know, in The <HI>Second</HI> Place, <HI>By what Marks it will be di&s;cern|able when a Soul is freed from the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of</HI> Satan.</P>
<P>And this will be di&s;cernable, 1. To the Per&s;ons them|&s;elves. 2. To other Chri&s;tians. 3. In &s;ome Mea&s;ure to the Gracele&s;s World.</P>
<P>And 1. The Per&s;ons them&s;elves may know: For, when the Spirit of GOD comes to ca&s;t out <HI>Satan,</HI> he convinces of <HI>Sin,</HI> of <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> and <HI>Judgment.</HI> He fir&s;t removes their natural Blindne&s;s; and they &s;ee them&s;elves to be all that I have de&s;cribed them to be, and wor&s;e.

By this Means they perceive the&s;e Things to be Sins, which they little thought of before. They &s;ee they have never given the Law its Due in any one In&s;tance of Life, in Thought, Word, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">or Deed. The Ignorance, Pride, Selfi&s;hne&s;s, Hypocri&s;y, Slothfulne&s;s, &amp;c. that were mix'd with their be&s;t Doings, are opened to their View, and they behold a whole World of Iniquity. But fur|ther, they &s;ee the heinous Nature of Sin, how hateful, how contrary to the Nature of GOD. Al&s;o the dread|ful Con&s;equences of it; the infinite Power and Ju&s;tice of GOD engaged again&s;t 'em for it; the burning Hell they are expo&s;ed to on account of it; the glorious Heaven they lo&s;e by it; and with all their own utter In|ability to expiate the Guilt of the &s;malle&s;t Sin. Their natural Stupidity and Carele&s;ne&s;s is al&s;o remov'd; they are exceedingly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and can be no longer ea&s;y; nothing will quiet them but an a&s;&s;ured Token of GOD's Favour and pardoning Grace. Thus he convinces of Sin; and they mu&s;t needs know what they are con|vinced of.</P>
<P>Then the Holy Gho&s;t opens up the Scriptures, and reveals to their fainting Souls the Scripture-Method of Falvation by the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of CHRIST; and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">kes them &s;ee, that, tho' they have no heavenly Beauty, Wi&s;dom, or Rightcou&s;ne&s;s, yet CHRIST is all they can want, or de&s;ire: They are &s;o &s;urely convinced of this, that they as little doubt of his Righreou&s;ne&s;s, as of their own Sins. They can venture their Souls, their <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">rnal Happine&s;s, upon the Truth of the Go&s;pel; they do not at all doubt of Life in CHRIST, if they could but win him, and be found in him. They &s;ee the Excellency of this Method of Salvation, and the ab|<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="5 letters"> Nece&s;&s;ity of this perfect Righteou&s;ne&s;s.

<PB N="17" REF="004716_0009_100DCC9655E80840" MS="y">al&s;o a willing Saviour, and will refu&s;e none that come to him. Thus they are convinced of Righteou&s;ne&s;s; and can they be convinced of any Thing, and not know that they are convinced of it?</P>
<P>Further, their native Pride is broken down; their hard Hearts are melted, and their ob&s;tinate Wills made pliable, and cheerfully con&s;ent to take CHRIST for <HI>Wi&s;dom, Rightrou&s;ne&s;s, Sanctification,</HI> and <HI>Redemption.</HI> Then he is lovely above all Things, the Chiefe&s;t among ten Thousand in their E&s;teem. He is their Choice, their Delight, their Happine&s;s, the Center of all their Affections, the Ground of their Hopes and Joys. They cannot be &s;atisfied without a Sen&s;e of his Pre&s;ence; they are troubled when he hides his Face. In&s;tead of a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">avi&s;h Terror and Horror of Con&s;cience, they are, &s;ometimes, fill'd with inward Peace, and Con&s;olation, and Joy in the Holy Gho&s;t. Then is the Power of Sin broken, and the Life is reform'd to better Purpo&s;e than ever it was before. They love what they formerly loathed; and hate what they lov'd. Strict Holine&s;s is lovely, GOD's Laws are &s;weet to their Souls; they delight in religious Exerci&s;es, in religious Company, and &s;piritual Conference, in&s;tead of wanton Frolicks and vain Mirth. In&s;tead of Pride, Covetou&s;ne&s;s, out|ragious Pa&s;&s;ions, Hatred, and Wrathfulne&s;s; they have Humility, Meekne&s;s, and Gentlene&s;s, Love to the People of GOD, Love to their Enemies, a generous Contempt of earthly Things, Heavenly-Mindedne&s;s. In&s;tead of carele&s;s Lives, there is a Watch upon their very Thoughts. They daily mourn under a Sen&s;e of their daily Mi&s;carriages, and grieve at the inborn Cor|ruptions which they feel in their Souls. Thus they &s;ight under CHRIST'S Banner, again&s;t the Devil, the World, and the Fle&s;h. Thus they are convinced of Judgment; for whoever have felt the&s;e Things, may know.

2. This will be di&s;cernable to other Chri&s;tians, and that by Analogy, or Compari&s;on of Experiences: For, tho' the Work of GOD may differ in &s;ome Circum|&s;tances in the Beginning; yet in Sub&s;tance it is the &s;ame; and when it is wrought, is ju&s;t the &s;ame in all; there is but one Faith, and one Spirit. Real Chri&s;tians have all the &s;ame De&s;ires, the &s;ame Fears, the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ionate Breathings of Love to GOD and CHRIST; the &s;ame Pur&s;uits after Holine&s;s, and Mortification of Sin; the &s;ame Complaints, the &s;ame Joys and Com|forts; the &s;ame Supports and Encouragements: Cat down and rai&s;ed up on the very &s;ame Accounts; have the &s;ame Savour, Ta&s;te, and Reli&s;h of divine Things. There is an Onene&s;s among them, a Fellow-Feeling of one another's Grievances, a Bearing of one another's Burdens. This endears them to one another above the deare&s;t gracele&s;s Relations. Now, 'tis from this Same|ne&s;s of Experiences that their Knowledge of one another proceeds. When they tell each other what GOD has done for their Souls, they under&s;tand one another &s;weet|ly; and the one &s;ees him&s;elf in the other's Heart when it is told him. As a Traveller (making Allowance for Similitudes) will know that another has travell'd the &s;ame Road, by his exact De&s;cription of particular Pla|ces; and can di&s;tingui&s;h between him, and another that has only read the <HI>Geographical</HI> De&s;cription of it, by the different Remarks they will unavoidably make. And what tho' &s;ome Hypocrites may be taken for Chri&s;tians, and &s;ome weak Chri&s;tians mi&s;taken too; Yet <HI>particular Exceptions do not break general Rules:</HI> The Body of Hypocrites and Chri&s;tians will not be for ea&s;ily mi&s;taken by experienced, judicious Chri&s;tians, as carnal People imagine. For tho' many gracele&s;s Per&s;ons may learn to talk of Chri&s;tian Experiences, yet they will generally bewray their Ignorance in &s;ome thing or other, that every real Chri&s;tian knows, when they come clo&s;e to the Point. But &s;till they will want that
<PB N="19" REF="004716_0010_100DCC98D6541080" MS="y">Power, and Reli&s;h, and Savour of divine Things, which are inimitable. And hence the Apo&s;tle, in 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> iv. 19, 30. &s;ays, <HI>I will know, not the Words</HI> of &s;uch an one, <HI>but the Power; for the Kingdom of GOD</HI> con&s;i&s;ts <HI>not in Word, but in Power.</HI> So every real Chri&s;tian can di&s;tingui&s;h between <HI>Words</HI> and <HI>Power;</HI> or el&s;e the &s;ame Apo&s;tle would have in vain directed them to <HI>turn away from &s;uch as had the</HI> FORM, <HI>but deny'd the</HI> POWER <HI>of Gadline&s;s.</HI> 2 Tim. iii. 5. Now, if in expre&s;s Words the Power were deny'd, the Form would be wanting; and therefore it mu&s;t be &s;uch as have the Form, and in Words confe&s;s that Power of Godline&s;s, from whom Chri&s;tians mu&s;t turn away, only becau&s;e they <HI>have not</HI> this Power. But how could this be done, unle&s;s they could di&s;tingui&s;h between the <HI>Form,</HI> and the <HI>Power?</HI> But this they can do; for, whoever has had the Spirit and Pre&s;ence of GOD, cannot but know when he wants it, and when he has it; and knowing what Emotions of Heart he has in &s;uch and &s;uch Frames, he will the more readily di&s;cern, when another &s;peaks, prays, or preaches with the &s;ame Reli&s;h of divine Things; as he that has felt the Pa&s;&s;ions of Anger, Love, or Joy, will the more readily ob&s;erve the Symptoms of them in another. And a &s;piritual Object is as di&s;cernable to a &s;piritual Man, as a natural Object to a natural Man. But the natural Man, who is &s;piritually blind, cannot po&s;&s;ibly perceive the &s;piritual Object, cannot &s;avour the Things of GOD. But a Chri&s;tian cannot but know, when another &s;peaks &s;kilfully, feelingly, and di&s;tinctly of his own Ca&s;e; and al&s;o when it is ignorantly, in&s;ipidly, indi&s;tinctly, and powerle&s;ly &s;poken of. And hence the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, <HI>The &s;piritual Man judgeth all Things, yet he him&s;elf is judged of no Man.</HI> 1 Cor. ii. 15. That is, He can di&s;cern &s;piritual Things, and is be&s;t able to judge of &s;piritual Per&s;ons; yet he is not to be judged, as to his Experiences, by a natural Man; becau&s;e the natural Man is not a fit or proper Judge of &s;piritual Things, &s;eeing he under|&s;tands
<PB N="20" REF="004716_0011_100DCC9AE67CDFF0">them not. &mdash;Now, the&s;e internal Evidences of a Work of GOD can never be repre&s;ented to the Under&s;tandings of &s;uch who have never felt them, any more than Light or Colours to one born blind; he wants Proof that there is Light, and a&s;ks how we can know it; we can only tell him that the Light comes attended with its own Evidence, and by the Light we &s;ee Light. Ju&s;t &s;o it is here: Carnal Per&s;ons have a great many Exceptions again&s;t this Doctrine; they wonder how we can pretend to judge of the State of others; and will tell us, <HI>We take GOD's Prerogative upon us to judge the Hearts of Men;</HI> whereas we only judge them from what appears to us, in &s;o far as we know of their Manner of Life, and Chri&s;tian Experien|ces. And hence it is, that whenever GOD opens the Eyes of any, they &s;oon &s;ee what Company to join with. Hence likewi&s;e it is, that Chri&s;tians cannot but judge the&s;e to be gracele&s;s, who oppo&s;e, di&s;like, or &s;how Ig|norance of tho&s;e Things, which they know to be the Things of the Spirit of GOD. When they tell them &s;o, they call it Hatred and Rage; but this Doctrine proves that it is not.&mdash;Hence we may al&s;o infer, That the&s;e Per&s;ons, who have &s;ufficient Opportunity of knowing the Lives of Profe&s;&s;ors, and yet &s;ee no Difference among &s;uch as &s;eem to have an equal Quan|tity of Morality, and Head-Knowledge; I &s;ay, this Doctrine will prove the&s;e to be blind them&s;elves.

<P N="3">3. The Work of GOD may be di&s;cernable to them al&s;o; and that by &s;uch Evidences as carry in them a Probability that the Devil is ca&s;t out. Nay, according to their own Principles they are obliged to believe it: For their profe&s;&s;ed Principle is, to judge every Man a Chri&s;tian who is Moral and Orthodox: And tho' they be not competent Judges of Chri&s;tian Experiences, from whence they might have a <HI>Certainty</HI> of the Work of GOD; yet there are other Marks that are level to their Capacities, from whence they may have a <HI>Probability.</HI> As, when he that was formerly a Drunkard, lives a &s;ober Life: When a vain, light, and wanton Per&s;on becomes grave, and &s;edate: When the Bla&s;phemer becomes a Prai&s;er of GOD: When Laughter is turn'd into Mourning; and carnal Joy into Heavine&s;s; and that profe&s;&s;edly on account of their Souls Condition: When the Ignorant are fill'd with Knowledge in divine Things, and the Tongue that was dumb in the Things of GOD, &s;peaks the Language of <HI>Canaan:</HI> When the Erroneous are become Orthodox in fundamental Points: When &s;uch as never minded any Religion, do make Religion their only Ba&s;ine&s;s: When bu&s;y <HI>Marthas,</HI> and covetous Worldlings, do neglect their worldly Concerns to &s;eek after GOD's Ordinances.

<P N="1">1. As to the Circum&s;tances of the Church; He al|ways came when it needed a Reformation, even in the Judgment of gracele&s;s Profe&s;&s;ors; when Religion dwindled into an empty Form, and Profe&s;&s;ors had lo&s;t the Life and Power of Godline&s;s; in a Word, when
<PB N="24" REF="004716_0013_100DCC9EC2518D38">there was Midnight-Darkne&s;s, and little Faith to be found on the Earth. Thus it was when he came in the Fle&s;h; when he &s;ent St. <HI>Athana&s;ius, Luther</HI> and <HI>Calvin,</HI> and at the Reformation of <HI>Scotland.</HI> We find the gracele&s;s <HI>Jews</HI> prayed for the Day of the LORD, in <HI>Amos</HI> 5.18. And hence were our Pulpits filled with &s;eemingly devout Prayers for a Revival of Religion, and Confe&s;&s;ions of its decayed State. And what had we lately but a dry Formality? Did not all in general &s;eem to be at Ea&s;e in <HI>Zion,</HI> and in much Peace about the State of their Souls? How few were a&s;king the Watch-men, <HI>What of the Night?</HI> The Lives of Pro|fe&s;&s;ors carele&s;s, unholy, unguarded; Ordinances at|tended, Duties performed, Sermons preached, without Life or Power, and as little Succe&s;s. Was not world|ly Di&s;cour&s;e our mutual Entertainment at our &s;olemn A&s;&s;emblies on Holy-days? Thus in Darkne&s;s and Se|curity were we: And <HI>like People, like Prie&s;t.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. As to the Manner of his Coming; It never was in &s;uch a Manner as carnal Per&s;ons imagined; but &s;till unexpected, and out of the common Way. And this is a nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equent of the State of the Church: For &s;ince he comes in a dark Time, we may ea&s;ily conclude, that the Manner thereof is unob&s;erv'd at fir&s;t. He mu&s;t needs come unawares, when a carnal World have forgotten, and do neglect him; and do not know him, or the powerful Operations of his Spirit until they <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">l them. For tho' they may pray for the Day of the LORD; yet they know it not when it comes, and &s;o do not know what they a&s;k. <HI>Amos</HI> 5.18. Now, by this Means he comes always quire cro&s;s to the Inclina|tions of the Clergy, who are generally &s;unk in Carnality as well as the People. And as a Con&s;equence of this, the Mini&s;ters by whom He works, have always at fir&s;t been few: And thus the Work appears the more eminently to be his own, the le&s;s probable that the In|&s;truments appear. Thus it was when he came in the
<PB N="25" REF="004716_0013_100DCC9EC2518D38" MS="y">Fle&s;h. He came indeed out of <HI>Beth<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ehem,</HI> but in a mean Condition; and afterwards unperceivably chang|ing his Place, was mi&s;taken. When he enter'd on his publick Mini&s;try, it was <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> according to the Tradi|tions of the Fathers; for we find they were &s;urprized, in <HI>Luke</HI> iv. when he began to expound the Scriptures, being neither a Scribe nor Phari&s;ee. And the People not being u&s;ed with &s;uch clo&s;e and particular Applica|tions, could not bear his new Methods. Pa&s;&s;ing by the e&s;tabli&s;hed, but proud, bigotted, gain&s;aying Clergy, he chu&s;es Twelve unlearned, unpoli&s;hed Men, mo&s;t of them Fi&s;hers; and gave them a Commi&s;&s;ion to preach the Go&s;pel, without con&s;ulting the <HI>Sanhedrim</HI> about &s;uch <HI>unprecedented</HI> Proceedings. Thus was his Coming dark, and cro&s;s to them. &mdash; Now, in our Days the Parallel is plain, for &s;uppo&s;ing the pre&s;ent Commotion to be the Work of GOD: Every one knows how cro&s;s it is to the Inclinations of the Clergy. Surely, our Oppo&s;ers will confe&s;s, they neither did, nor do ex|pect Religion to be reviv'd in &s;uch a Manner; while there are &s;o many Things, in their Opinion, wrong. Surely, it is a dark Day to them, and no Light in it; many of them know not what to make of it, by their own Confe&s;&s;ion. We all know how few its Propagators are; and they &s;ay, that mo&s;t of us are unlearned: But do they not, by the by, bewray them&s;elves herein? For, if unlearned, they mu&s;t have the le&s;s Rhetorick and Oratory; and con&s;equently the le&s;s able to bring &s;uch Things to pa&s;s. If it were the Work of Man, a &s;uperior Power of Man would overthrow it. &mdash; In a Word, the Parallel holds in every Thing, only our Manner of Licen&s;ing is not <HI>unprecedented.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The Treatment he met with; As a native Con|&s;equence of his Coming in &s;o dark and mean a Condi|tion, and cro&s;s to the Minds of the Clergy; he was rejected by them, and by many of the Noble and Mighty after the Fle&s;h; who imbitter'd again&s;t him
<PB N="26" REF="004716_0014_100DCCA0C8D63CD0">as many People as they could influence. And as a Con&s;equence of his being di&s;own'd by the&s;e, he was chiefly followed by what we call the <HI>Mob,</HI> the <HI>Rabble,</HI> the <HI>common</HI> and <HI>meaner Sort.</HI> And being di&s;own'd by the &s;elf-righteous Morali&s;ts, was follow'd by the openly Profane, the <HI>Publicans,</HI> and <HI>Harlots:</HI> For he is &s;till &s;et for the <HI>Ri&s;e and Fall of many in</HI> I&s;rael; and many who thought them&s;elves <HI>fir&s;i,</HI> and were e&s;teemed &s;o by others in the Dark, did &s;how them&s;elves to be <HI>la&s;t.</HI> Thus it was when he came in the Fle&s;h; rejected by the Clergy &s;o generally, and by the Noble and Wi&s;e, that it was &s;aid, <HI>Have any of the Rulers or Phari&s;ees believed on him?</HI> No: <HI>But this People who know not the Law, are accur&s;ed.</HI> &mdash; Ju&s;t &s;o is he treated by the &s;ame Ranks of Per&s;ons at this Day. May I not a&s;k, Have any of the Rulers, have any of the Mini&s;ters embraced the pre&s;ent Work? Do they not rather pre|po&s;&s;e&s;s and imbitter the carnal People again&s;t it? And many who &s;eemed <HI>fir&s;t</HI> in Religion, are they not become the very <HI>la&s;t,</HI> and the <HI>la&s;t, fir&s;t?</HI> For our Oppo&s;ers confe&s;s of their own Accord, That <HI>it is only the ignorant Rabble that embrace it; many of which never minded any Religion, and &s;o do not know the Law.</HI> Sure they who know the Law, might know, that it is a good Proof of a Day of GOD's Power when <HI>the Poor have the Go&s;pel preach'd to them,</HI> and do receive it. <HI>Mat.</HI> xi. 5. Might they not know that our LORD u&s;ed this Argument? And al&s;o that <HI>GOD chu&s;es fooli&s;h Things to confound the Wi&s;e?</HI> But they mu&s;t confe&s;s, that tho' there be not <HI>many,</HI> yet, Glory to GOD! there are <HI>&s;ome</HI> of the <HI>Wi&s;e,</HI> and <HI>Mighty,</HI> and <HI>Noble,</HI> on our Side.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Effects and Con&s;equences of his Coming; As a Con&s;equence of the &s;trong Oppo&s;ition of the Clergy, and others of their Adherents, again&s;t him. Contrary to their own Intentions, their Speaking of him was a Means of &s;etting the People on the Search; and Num|bers flock'd after him, to hear the&s;e <HI>n<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">w Doctrines,</HI> and
<PB N="27" REF="004716_0014_100DCCA0C8D63CD0" MS="y"><HI>new Methods;</HI> and were then caught in the Go&s;pel-net: <HI>As many as were ordained to eternal Life, believed.</HI> Thus in <HI>Joh.</HI> vii. 11, <HI>&amp; &s;eq.</HI> the Phari&s;ees &s;peaking again&s;t him, put him in the People's Minds, who began to talk of him. His Audiences were often deeply affected; and frequently divided between him and the Clergy: And hence we &s;o often read, that <HI>there was a Divi&s;ion among the People.</HI> He never came to &s;end Peace on the Earth, but a <HI>Sword,</HI> and <HI>Divi&s;ion.</HI> Luk. xii. 51&mdash;58. &mdash; Ju&s;t &s;o it has been in our Day. Many can &s;ay by Experience, that their Attention and Curio&s;ity was rai&s;ed by Means of the Contradictions of their Mini&s;ters. And hence we have &s;een unu&s;ual Numbers going to hear the Word like thir&s;ty Flocks: And heard a great Mourning, like the Mourning of <HI>Hadadrimmon</HI> in the Valley of <HI>Megid|don.</HI> Al&s;o there has been a Divi&s;ion among the People; &s;ome prai&s;ing GOD for what their Eyes have &s;een, and their Ears heard, and their Souls felt; others going way mocking, contradicting, bla&s;pheming.</P>
<P>Another Effect was, the Breaking down of Bigotry; partly as a native Con&s;equence of the Attention of all Parties being rai&s;ed to come and hear; and partly by the Example and Directions of CHRIST, and his Fol|lowers. Thus he freely conver&s;ed, eat, and drank, with different oppo&s;ite Parties, <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Samaritans, Publicans</HI> and <HI>Phari&s;ees;</HI> and ju&s;tified his &s;o doing from the Need there was of it, that all might come freely, and reap Benefit. And the Apo&s;tle, in <HI>Phil.</HI> iii. 15, 16. advi&s;es real Chri&s;tians who hold the Foundation, to walk together in &s;uch Things as they are agreed in; for in Things wherein they are di&s;agreed, they cannot. &mdash; And ju&s;t &s;o our Oppo&s;ers confe&s;s it to be now, while they accu&s;e us for holding Communion with different Societies, and would in&s;inuate, that we do &s;o from &s;ome politick De&s;ign: Indeed there is this Policy in it, To gain &s;ome by any Means, and make a Party for JESUS CHRIST.</P>

5. The Attempts; As a Con&s;equence of the People's following CHRIST or his Amba&s;&s;adors, and di&s;regard|ing the Clergy, the latter always attempted to over|throw the <HI>new Scheme:</HI> Were (1) unwearied in form|ing mi&s;chievous Devices again&s;t him; would tell the People, they had an Impo&s;ture, and were deluded, and deceiv'd; followed him for no other End but to find &s;omething to cavil at; wre&s;ted both his Words and Actions to find Matter of Accu&s;ation. (2) They were un&s;atisfied; for after they had been bu&s;y all along, they &s;ay, <HI>What do we?</HI> q. d. We have been too &s;lack and cowardly; come, let us be&s;tir our&s;elves, and not &s;uffer all to be overturn'd; we have prevail'd nothing as yet. (3) Their Attempts were &s;till un&s;ucce&s;sful, and always tended to promote the Cau&s;e they were &s;et to baffle: Tho' they are &s;till bu&s;y, yet are con&s;cious they prevail nothing. Thus when the Scribes and Phari&s;ees &s;ought Chri&s;t at the Fea&s;t, <HI>Joh.</HI> vii. 11. they put him in the People's Minds, who &s;traight began to talk of him, &s;ome good, &s;ome evil: When the Phari&s;ees perceived this, they &s;orbid them to &s;peak of him either good or ill; for &s;o much is imply'd in the&s;e Words, <HI>Howbeit no Man &s;poke openly of him, for Fear of the Jews.</HI> They hoped that the Thoughts of Chri&s;t would wear out of the People's Minds thro' Time. &mdash; Ju&s;t thus do the Op|po&s;ers now to a tittle It can be made appear, how Companies of Mini&s;ters and People, have met together in a private Manner, to con&s;ult how they might &s;uppre&s;s the <HI>new Scheme,</HI> and what they could &s;ay again&s;t it: And indeed, their Cavils, and the Spirit with which they are urged, do plainly &s;how, that they rather de&s;ire Matter of Accu&s;ation, than that they really have it. How do they twi&s;t and wre&s;t both the Words and Actions, and magni&s;y the Blemi&s;hes, of tho&s;e who &s;tand up for the Work of GOD? If they can find an un|guarded Expre&s;&s;ion, they draw what horrid Con&s;equen|ces from it they can, and then affirm that this is the

They &s;till found Exceptions again&s;t all his Works; and when they could not deny the Matter of Fact, they a&s;cribed it to the Devil &s;ometimes. How often do they a&s;k the Man born blind, how he receiv'd his Sight? and would willingly have deny'd that he was blind: How earne&s;t were they to find &s;ome Flaw or other? And when they could find none, they put a religious Face upon their Envy; exhort the Man to give GOD the Glory, but not to mind JESUS; for they were &s;ure he was a Sinner. &mdash; Ju&s;t &s;o it is now a-days to a tittle. Our Oppo&s;ers have no End of a&s;king for Evidences; without taking Notice of the Power of GOD, that has appear'd in the A&s;&s;emblies, or on the Lives of Men: They &s;till mu&s;ter up Objections, and harp only on what they call Di&s;order.

There is the &s;ame kind of Oppo&s;ition, and Oppo&s;ers too, in <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>England</HI> at pre&s;ent, as here in <HI>America.</HI> And had I Time, I could &s;how that all Things, in every Period of the Church, an&s;wer and agree with this, as Face an&s;wers Face in a Gla&s;s. But the Coming of CHRIST in the Fle&s;h, will be found to be analogous to his Coming at other Times; and the Parallel from that, is mo&s;t level to the Capacity of every one; and trac'd with le&s;s Difficulty, and more Certainty by common People: And therefore I have chie&s;ly compar'd that Period, and our pre&s;ent Day.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="004716_0017_100D8796AB0DF518" MS="y">
But la&s;tly, if <HI>Satan</HI> be ca&s;t out, <HI>It</HI> will be in&s;tead of all Proofs, that the Kingdom of GOD is come unto us. For, &s;ays CHRIST, <HI>if I ca&s;t out Devils by the Spirit of GOD, then the Kingdom of GOD is come unto you.</HI></P>
<P>I have &s;hown under the <HI>Second</HI> Head, how the People of GOD may know this to be true of them&s;elves; and how they are &s;atisfied of each other, by Analogy of Experiences; and accordingly they believe, and are &s;ure, that the Kingdom of GOD is come. They know the Voice of their Beloved. And therefore I &s;hall only in&s;i&s;t on &s;uch Evidences now, as can appear to the World.</P>
<P>And here it is evident, that a peaceful World has been rou&s;ed with a Witne&s;s about the State of their Souls. <HI>Luke</HI> xi. 21, 22. The&s;e who were ignorant, can &s;peak &s;kilfully about religious Things; and even the Gracele&s;s are increa&s;ed in Knowledge: Which is a Proof, That <HI>Light is come into the World.</HI> Some <HI>Dei&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> are become &s;ound in the Faith; and Drunkards have become &s;ober; Swearers and Bla&s;phe|mers drop their Oaths, and &s;peak reverently of GOD: Vain Per&s;ons who minded no Religion, but frequented Taverns, Plays and Frolicks, pa&s;&s;ing their Time in Filthine&s;s, fooli&s;h Talking and Je&s;ting, or &s;inging paltry Songs; do now frequent Chri&s;tian Societies, &s;eek Chri&s;tian Conver&s;ation, and talk of Soul-Concerns; and chu&s;e to expre&s;s their Mirth in Pflams, and Hymns, and &s;piritual Songs. They who were too &s;prightly to be devout, and e&s;teemed it an unmanly Thing to &s;hed Tears for their Souls State; have mourned as for an only Son, and &s;eemed to be in Bitternerne&s;s as for a Fir&s;t-born. <HI>Zech.</HI> xii. 10. Worldlings have quit their Labour, and earne&s;tly followed the Ordinances of GOD. Pious and Soul-&s;earching Books, that &s;ormerly lay neglected, are now in great Reque&s;t. And, which is yet more, Per&s;ons who only came to mock at the Lamentations of others, have been convinced ere they
<PB N="34" REF="004716_0018_100DCCA984413008">went away, and by free Grace profelyted to &s;uch Ways as they formerly de&s;pi&s;ed. Mini&s;ters have been &s;trengthned, and &s;tirr'd up, to preach every Day for &s;ome Time con&s;iderable. &mdash; And that all this is Con|&s;equent upon the Preaching of true Go&s;pel-Doctrine, the printed Writings of tho&s;e Mini&s;ters, by whom the Work is carried on, will prove. Their Doctrine is plainly &s;ubver&s;ive of <HI>Satan</HI>'s Kingdom; tho' they be &s;landerou&s;ly reported of, by &s;ome, who &s;trive to per|plex Things that are plain, and make an unguarded Expre&s;&s;ion to be un&s;ound Doctrine: Yet, if their Doctrines be compared with tho&s;e of our pious An|ce&s;tors, it will be evident, that they harmonize in the &s;ame Truths in experimental Things; and con&s;equent|ly we mu&s;t think, That <HI>the Hearts of the Children are turn'd to the Fathers,</HI> from whom they had degenerated.</P>
<P>Now, let it be ob&s;erv'd, that I do not lay down the&s;e outward Evidences as infallible Marks of true Grace: Let none judge him&s;elf Gracious from them alone, without the internal Evidences formerly de&s;cribed. I only urge the&s;e, becau&s;e gracele&s;s Per&s;ons cannot judge from the other Marks; and becau&s;e Oppo&s;ers of God's Work, are obliged, by their own profe&s;&s;ed Principles, to acknowledge, That <HI>Satan is ca&s;t out,</HI> when &s;uch Things appear. &mdash; And were it nece&s;&s;ary, I could produce many In&s;tances of &s;uch Reformations as I have mentioned.</P>
<P>And how &s;hall any now account for their Oppo&s;ition to this Work? I de&s;ire to &s;peak to &s;uch with Bowels of Love.</P>
<P>My Dear Fellow-Mortals! Let me a while expo&s;tu|late the Matter with you. Why do you not act agree|able to your own Principles? A dry Formali&s;t, who &s;hows no Reli&s;h, nor Power of Godline&s;s, &s;eems to live cha&s;te, hone&s;t, and &s;ober; and you charitably judge he does &s;o by the Grace of GOD. Another, who was
<PB N="35" REF="004716_0018_100DCCA984413008" MS="y">drunken and unclean, becomes cha&s;te and &s;ober, lively and zealous withal; and you in&s;inuate or &s;ay, that it is by the Power of the Devil. Why do you not con&s;i&s;t with your&s;elves? Why do you &s;ay the one is of GOD, and the other of the Devil, who is a zealous Pleader for the Work of GOD? Do you not &s;ee, that GOD can condemn you by your own Rules? One Man diligently attended GOD's Ordinances all his Days, being in|&s;tructed out of the Law, and accu&s;tomed to approve of the Things that are more excellent; and you would allow he does &s;o by the Power of GOD, becau&s;e he is an orderly Man, and is very orthodox in Mint, and Ani&s;e, and Cumin. Another that was heedle&s;s of all Reli|gion, a Publican, Harlot, Sabbath-breaker, Erroneous, does now take much Pains to wait upon GOD, and begins to ob&s;erve the divine Law; and yet you &s;ay, it is the Work of Men or Devils: Therefore, the&s;e very Per&s;ons, whom you approve of, &s;hall be your Judges, and witne&s;s again&s;t your glaring Partiality. The&s;e de&s;pi&s;ed Publicans and Harlots, &s;hall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven before you, and &s;it down with <HI>Abraham, I&s;aac,</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI> when you, the pro|fe&s;&s;ed Children of the Kingdom, &s;hall be thru&s;t down to utter Darkne&s;s, except you repent.</P>
<P>Was not the World very &s;ecure a while ago, in Compari&s;on of what it is now? Did not many appear to be at Ea&s;e in <HI>Zion,</HI> who are now alarmed? Or if you &s;hould deny that moral Profe&s;&s;ors were in a carnal Secu|rity, tho' contrary to the expre&s;s Declaration of many of them; yet, mu&s;t you not confe&s;s, that the openly Profane, the gro&s;sly Ignorant, who minded no Religion, were in a carnal Security? And if &s;uch Per&s;ons had Peace about the State of their Souls, mu&s;t you not &s;ay, that the Devil made the Peace? Now then, let me a&s;k you, <HI>How can one <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ter into a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">trong Man's Hou&s;e, and &s;poil his Goods, unle&s;s he fir&s;t bind the &s;trong Man?</HI> If the Devil kept the&s;e in Slavery, mu&s;t they not have

<P>Do you not perceive a great Change on &s;ome of your Neighbours? Do you not ob&s;erve &s;ome of them to be more devout and &s;erious, more &s;ober and knowing, who u&s;ed to be quite otherwi&s;e? And how do you account for the&s;e Things? Why do you not either make the Tree good, and its Fruit good; or el&s;e, corrupt, and its Fruit corrupt? Either &s;ay, that Sobriety and De|votion, Temperance and Cha&s;tity, diligent Attendance on GOD's Ordinances, Chri&s;tian Conference, Sorrow for Sin, Leaving it off, &amp;c. are good, and proceed from a good Cau&s;e; or el&s;e, &s;ay that they are evil, and pro|ceed from an evil Cau&s;e. But if von &s;ay they are good; why do you a&s;cribe them to <HI>Satan?</HI> Can he give what he has not? Either &s;peak Things that are con&s;i&s;tent, or el&s;e be &s;ilent. <HI>And why do you not even of your&s;elves judge what is right?</HI> But, <HI>O Generation of Vibers, how can ye, being evil,</HI> and unrenewed, <HI>&s;peak good Things? For out of the Abundance of the Heart, the Mouth &s;peaketn.</HI> Matth. xii. 34.</P>
<P>Perhaps you will &s;ay, That you &s;ee no Change, only that People are more cen&s;orious and uncharitable, judg|ing their Neighbours to be gracele&s;s, and &s;eem har&s;h and pa&s;&s;ionate again&s;t other Mini&s;ters, whom they call carnal; and you a&s;k, Are the&s;e the Fruits of the Spirit of GOD?</P>
<P>In An&s;wer, I would de&s;ire your&s;elves to tell' by what Rule you would have them judge an Oppo&s;er of GOD's Work to be gracious, who per&s;i&s;ts again&s;t all Evidences of it? Either he does &s;o ignorantly, or knowingly? If ignorantly, does it not prove that he is &s;piritually plind, and cannot perceive the Things of GOD, and &s;o mu&s;t be <HI>Gracele&s;s?</HI> But if he does &s;o &s;pitefully, contrary to the Remon&s;trances of his Con&s;cience, en<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ghtned by the Spirit of GOD; it &s;eems to be
<PB N="37" REF="004716_0019_100DCCAC4C871F70" MS="y">plainly the unpardonable Sin. And why will you accu&s;e me for judging thus, until you prove what I contend for to be the Work of the Devil? Why do you make that Practice an Argument that it is not the Work of GOD, &s;ince its being his Work will ju&s;ti&s;y the Practice? It I &s;hould judge Oppo&s;ers of GOD's Work to be gracious, as well as tho&s;e who plead for it; then I would, like you, be incon&s;i&s;tent with my&s;elf; then I would make it, not the Work of GOD, but &s;ome indifferent Thing, where Men might be good, and hold either Side. &mdash; It is no new Thing to hear Zeal for GOD, and Oppo&s;ition to the Enemies of his Cau&s;e, mi&s;taken for Pa&s;&s;ion and Rage, by &s;uch as never have felt the Love of GOD in their Hearts. And if &s;ome Chri&s;tians, when provok'd by your bla&s;phemous Railery, do &s;peak pa&s;&s;ionately with Indignation, I think &s;omething of it is very ju&s;tifiable, when I con&s;ider <HI>Paul</HI>'s Words to <HI>Elymas,</HI> Act. xiii. 10. <HI>O &s;uil of all Subtilty, and all Michief, thou Child of the Devil, thou Enemy of all Righteou&s;ne&s;s, wilt thou not cea&s;e to pervert the right Ways of the LORD?</HI> But, no doubt, their Zeal may &s;ometimes be as ra&s;h as <HI>Peter</HI>'s, when he cut off <HI>Malchus</HI>'s Ear: The LORD does not approve of this, neither do we: Young Chri&s;tians have often too much Wild-Fire, mixt with true Zeal. And if ever your Hearts had been warm with Zeal for GOD and his Cau&s;e, if you had ever had a <HI>Fir&s;t Love;</HI> (Rev. ii. 4.) then you would know it to be as I &s;ay; and would be ready to make Allowances, e&s;pecially in &s;ome warm Tempers. &mdash; But I &s;uppo&s;e you would have them be perfect, all Spirit, and no Fle&s;h. &mdash; They them&s;elves long to be &s;o. But if they were, it would not &s;creen them from your Malice, more than our LORD from the Phari&s;ees. <HI>Malchus</HI> had as good an Argument, as you, to prove that <HI>Peter</HI> had no Grace; that CHRIST and all his Followers were quarrel&s;ome and &s;editious: And it is probable he did improve it to the &s;ame End
<PB N="38" REF="004716_0020_100DCCAE14BAD2E0">as you do other Things; a&s;king, if that was any Fruit of the Spirit to cut off his Ear? No doubt he might &s;ay, <Q>If that be Conver&s;ion, may God keep me from it; the&s;e that pretend mo&s;t of all to it, are the mo&s;t bitter and outragious; one of the Gang cut off my Ear, from a religious Pretence; there's none of them better; they are all embarqued in the &s;ame Ship, and have the &s;ame &s;our and har&s;h Turn of Mind.</Q> Ju&s;t thus you blind your&s;elves by poring only on the black Spots of GOD's People, and &s;trive to make them more &s;o: Where then is your boa&s;ted Charity? Do you not &s;ee that all your Cavils and Objections prove you to be ignorant of the Things of GOD, and Enemies to his Work? Do you not &s;ee that your very Objec|tions prove it to be his Work, and always will? For thus has GOD always over&s;hot the Devil in his own Bow. Perhaps &s;ome of you will &s;ay, We are not again&s;t it. But do you not &s;how, that you are not for it? Are you not more cordial with its Enemies, than its Friends? Are you not &s;till making Exceptions again&s;t it? I look upon all Neuters, as Enemies, in Affairs of Religion. Away with your carnal Prudence! And either follow <HI>GOD</HI> or <HI>Baal. He that is not</HI> actually <HI>with us, is again&s;t us; and he that gathereth not with us, &s;eattereth abread.</HI> Mat. xii. 30.</P>
<P>I know there will be no End of your Objections, and calling for Evidences, until GOD open your Eyes, if ever he do it. The Que&s;tion is likely &s;till to be, <HI>What Sign, what Proof do you give us, &s;eeing &s;o many Things are wrong?</HI> I will an&s;wer, as our LORD did on the &s;ame Occa&s;ion, <HI>An evil and adulterous Generation &s;ecketh after a Sign, and there &s;hall no other Sign be given to it, but</HI> only the <HI>POWER of GOD's WORD</HI> on the Hearts and Lives of Mankind. This is the la&s;t, and greate&s;t Evidence; and if you reject this, you reject the la&s;t Means of your Conviction.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="004716_0020_100DCCAE14BAD2E0" MS="y">
I tell you further, That <HI>the Sin again&s;t the Holy Cho&s;t &s;hall never be forgiven.</HI> And I verily fear, that many, both Mini&s;ters and People, in this Generation, will be guilty of it: For GOD generally leaves a Te&s;timony in the Con&s;ciences of his bittere&s;t Enemies; and when they per&s;i&s;t again&s;t the&s;e Convictions, and the cleare&s;t Evi|dences of Matters of Fact, &s;pitefully, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> reproach the Work of his Spirit; I have &s;mall Hopes that they &s;hall ever be renewed to Repentance.

Indeed I am afraid, le&s;t I hear, to my Sorrow, that &s;ome of you die in a <HI>fearful Looking for of Wrath and fury Indignation.</HI> But whoever of you do the&s;e Things ignorantly, as <HI>Paul,</HI> who verily thought he &s;hould do many Things again&s;t <HI>Je&s;us of Nazareth;</HI> there is yet Hope concerning you. I be&s;eech you then, &s;ear and tremble to proceed further: Pray to GOD, if, perhaps, the Thoughts of your Hearts, and Words of your Mouths, may be forgiven you. And do not re&s;i&s;t the&s;e Evidences that are as clear as you are capable of, until GOD give you to know the Things of his Spirit. If you will re&s;i&s;t, I tell you in the Fear of GOD, it will be more tolerable for <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah,</HI> for <HI>Tyre</HI> and <HI>Sidon,</HI> in the Day of Judgment, than for you: <HI>Ninevels</HI> together with them, &s;hall ri&s;e up in Judgment again&s;t you, and &s;hall condemn you; becau&s;e you have Oppor|tunity of greater Light than they. And tho' you be exalted nearer Heaven, yet wo to you, for with a more dreadful Vengeance will you be plunged deeper into Hell. And every Word you &s;peak again&s;t the Work of GOD, you &s;hall give Account thereof in the Day of Judgment. Your fal&s;e and malicious Slanders again&s;t GOD's Servants, will be &s;et in Order before the a&s;&s;em|hled Univer&s;e. And how will you then make good your Party again&s;t GOD? Neither will the Mini&s;ters,

No, you &s;hall fall in the Day, and the fal&s;e Prophet &s;hall fall with you in the Night, and GOD will de&s;troy, you both; you &s;hall go down with them into the Sides of the Pit, and make your Beds in Hell; both &s;hall fall together into the burning Gulf of eternal Wo, unle&s;s you repent.
