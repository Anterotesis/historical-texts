<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM honoured with yours of Augu&s;t 30. Mine of the 7th of that month a&s;&s;ured you that mea&s;ures were taken for excluding from all further a&s;ylum in our ports, ve&s;&s;els armed in them to cruize on nations with which we are at peace, and for the re&s;toration of the prizes the Lovely La&s;s, Prince William Henry, and the Jane of Dublin; and that &s;hould the mea&s;ures for re&s;titution fail in their effect, the Pre&s;ident con&s;idered it as in|cumbent on the United States to make com|pen&s;ation for the ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>WE are bound by our treaties with three of the belligerent nations, by all the means in our power to protect and defend their ve&s;&s;els and effects in our ports, or waters, or on the &s;eas near our &s;hores, and to recover and re&s;tore the &s;ame to the right owners when taken from them. If all the means in our power are u&s;ed, and fail in their effect, we are not bound by our treaties with tho&s;e nations to make compen&s;ation.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="031414_0042_0FEC51AE190E71A8">THOUGH we have no &s;imilar treaty with Great Britain, it was the opinion of the Pre&s;ident, that we &s;hould u&s;e towards that nation the &s;ame rule, which under this article, was to govern us with the other nations; and even to extend it to captures made on the high &s;eas, and brought into our ports, if done by ve&s;&s;els which had been armed within them.</P>
<P>HAVING, for particular rea&s;ons, forbore to u&s;e all the means in our power for the re&s;ti|tution of the three ve&s;&s;els mentioned in my letter of Augu&s;t 7th, the Pre&s;ident thought it incumbent on the United States to make compen&s;ation for them: And though nothing was &s;aid in that letter of other ve&s;&s;els taken under like circum&s;tances, and brought in after the 5th of June, and before the date of that letter, yet when the &s;ame forbearance had taken place, it was and is his opinion, that compen&s;ation would be equally due.</P>
<P>AS to prizes made under the &s;ame cir|cum&s;tances, and brought in after the date of that letter, the Pre&s;ident determined, that all the means in our power &s;hould be u&s;ed for their re&s;titution. If the&s;e fail, as we &s;hould not be bound by our treaties to make compen&s;ation to the other powers in the analogous ca&s;e, he did not mean to give an opinion that it ought to be done to Great Britain. But &s;till if any ca&s;es &s;hall ari&s;e &s;ub|&s;equent to that date, the circum&s;tances of
<PB N="43" REF="031414_0043_0FEC51B24D89DDB8">
which &s;hall place them on &s;imilar ground with tho&s;e before it, the Pre&s;ident would think compen&s;ation equally incumbent on the United States.</P>
<P>In&s;tructions are given to the governors of the different &s;tates, to u&s;e all the means in their power for re&s;toring prizes of this la&s;t de&s;cription found within their ports. Though they will of cour&s;e take mea&s;ures to be in|formed of them, and the general government has given them the aid of the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officers for this purpo&s;e, yet you will be &s;en|&s;ible of the importance of multiplying the channels of their information as far as &s;hall depend on your&s;elf, or any per&s;on under your direction, in order that the governors may u&s;e the means in their power for making re&s;titution.</P>
<P>Without knowledge of the capture they cannot re&s;tore it. It will always be be&s;t to give the notice to them directly; but any information which you &s;hall be plea&s;ed to &s;end to me al&s;o at any time &s;hall be for|warded to them as quickly as di&s;tance will permit.</P>
<P>Hence you will perceive, Sir, that the Pre&s;ident contemplates re&s;titution or com|pen&s;ation in the ca&s;e before the 7th of Au+gu&s;t; and after that date, re&s;titution if it can be effected by any means in our power. And that it will be important that you &s;hould &s;ub&s;tantiate the fact, that &s;uch prizes are in our ports or waters.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="031414_0044_0FEC51BB1A273C78">Your li&s;t of the privateers illicitly armed in our ports is, I believe, correct.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to lo&s;&s;es by detention, wa&s;te, &s;poliation &s;u&s;tained by ve&s;&s;els taken as be|fore mentioned, between the dates of June 5th and Augu&s;t 7th, it is propo&s;ed as a pro|vi&s;ional mea&s;ure, that the collector of the cu&s;|toms of the di&s;trict, and the Briti&s;h con&s;ul, or any other per&s;on you plea&s;e, &s;hall appoint per&s;ons to e&s;tabli&s;h the value of the ve&s;&s;el and cargo, at the time of her capture and of her arrival in the port into which &s;he is brought, according to their value in that port. If this &s;hall be agreeable to you, and, you will be plea&s;ed to &s;ignify it to me, with the names of the prizes under&s;tood to be of this de&s;cription, in&s;tructions will be given accordingly, to the collector of the cu&s;toms where the re&s;pective ve&s;&s;els are.</P>
