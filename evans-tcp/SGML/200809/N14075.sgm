<HEAD>EPISTLE To all &s;uch Readers as are not &s;o far po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the &s;tupifying Doctrine, of SALTATION FOR ALL MEN, as to be quite in&s;en&s;ible of the Nature and Importance of SCRIPTURAL EVIDENCE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Author of the following Tract, has lately &s;een an anonymous pamphlet, entitled, SALVATION FOR ALL MEN. In which, though the author kept him&s;elf be|hind the curtain, he ventured to name &s;everal of his favorite authors, and of them he gives great a&s;&s;urance to the public, that they were &s;kilful demagogues, and worthy of undoubted confidence. And we mu&s;t be very &s;ceptical if we don't con&s;i|der this publi&s;her, as their cordial devotee. He had al&s;o &s;een a &s;erious an&s;wer to that namele&s;s pamphlet, done by the vener|able Dr. Mather. Al&s;o a printed letter to the doctor, in which the author appears to di&s;play HIMSELF. The author of this piece has al&s;o been favored with another reply to the above namele&s;s pamphlet; &s;tiled THE DOCTRINE OF FUTURE PUNISHMENT ILLUSTRATED. And was agreeably &s;ti|mulated by its kind, but ju&s;t reproof of "&s;inful latitude, and &s;piritual &s;leep." p. 4. Preface addre&s;&s;ed to all who &s;ee gro&s;s attacks made on the revealed &s;y&s;tem, profe&s;s honor for it, and yet with MEROZ of old, come no forth to the help of the Lord, again&s;t the mighty. For though nothing great, has been exhibited in the la&s;t attack, except the unbelief, and daring front, which it indicates. Yet as all oppo&s;ition to the bible, is patronized by the prince of darkne&s;s; &s;o it be|comes all who di&s;avow his dominion, to take the alarm, and beat to arms. The leaders of this attack boa&s;t of an|tiquity; yet they &s;eem cautious of the true original, which we have from authority quite indi&s;putable. Gen. iii. 4, in the&s;e words "ye &s;hall not &s;urely die." They boa&s;t al&s;o of the number and importance of their abettors; but they do not care to &s;peak out, and &s;ay "our name is Legion." And yet all who tremble at the word of the Lord, con&s;ider them as acting the legionary part, and executing the im|port of that early delu&s;ion: no, no, "ye &s;hall not &s;urely die." But all may be admoni&s;hed, that this flattery, is not le&s;s malignent, for making its appearance again, at &s;o late a period: nor its circumvention, le&s;s certain; or its tragical tendency le&s;s tremendous in its nature, than at fir&s;t. But the reigning Lord of the world, has pleged him&s;elf "to brui&s;e the &s;erpents head. And he never &s;uffers this fir&s;t oppo&s;er
<PB N="IV" REF="017812_0004_0FA31B14C2DBDB78">
of his de&s;igns, and corruptor of his truth to prevail, any farther than he both knows how, and is inflexibly deter|mined, to terminate in the accompli&s;hment of his purpo&s;e. For in defiance of all oppo&s;ition, "he will do all his plea|&s;ure, and nothing &s;hall &s;tay his hand." Yea, though "the enemy come in like a flood," he will lift up a hundred a|gain&s;t him. I&s;aia lix. 19. This therefore gives &s;trong con|&s;olation to all who tremble for the ark of God, at this day. He knew the council of the Syrians in their bed-cham|ber. He heard the reproachful words of SENACHERIB, a|gain&s;t the living God. And he dares all oppo&s;ition &s;till, when he &s;ays "a&s;&s;ociate your&s;elves, O ye people, and ye &s;hall be broken in pieces; and give ear, all ye of far coun|tries: gird your&s;elves, and ye &s;hall be broken in pieces; gird your&s;elves, and ye &s;hall be broken in pieces. Take council, and it &s;hall come to nought; &s;peak the word, and it &s;hall not &s;tand: for God is with us." I&s;aia viii. 9, 10. Now all the&s;e things are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are to come. I. Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. x. 11. And the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e are mighty &s;wa&s;ives to induce all, who with purpo&s;e of heart chu&s;e to &s;erve the Lord, and to whom his word is precious, to attend to it, confide in it, and do it unu&s;ual honors, in this day of rebuke and bla&s;phemy: viz.</P>
<P N="1">1. When the words of many in MALACHI's time, were &s;tout again&s;t the Lord: and they &s;tood upon their vindica|tion, in&s;i&s;ting on it, that they have rea&s;on to alledge a|gain&s;t divine ordinations; and counted the proud who did &s;o, the happy men; and even celebrated and extolled tho&s;e who boldly wrought wickedne&s;s, and tempted God. Mal. iii. 13, 14, 15. Even then, tho&s;e who feared the Lord, did openly &s;peak, appear, and act in te&s;timony for him. And it plea&s;ed the Lord, he hearkened and heard their te&s;timonies, and kept a memorial thereof in their favour, in his book of remembrence. V. 16.</P>
<P N="2">2. He will render to every man according to his deeds: &s;o tho&s;e who by con&s;tant patience in doing good, exert them&s;elves in &s;eeking the honor and glory of God, and in maintaining the honor of his holy word, he will render e|ternal life. Which to all who contentiou&s;ly oppo&s;e his re|vealed nature and will, and &s;o do not obey the truth; but actually obey righteousne&s;s, in re&s;pect to &s;entiment, pro|fe&s;&s;ion and practice, contrary to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of his ho|ly
<PB N="V" REF="017812_0005_0FA31B1583070A28">
word: to every &s;oul of them "he will render indigna|tion and wrath, tribulation and angui&s;h." Rom. ii. 6,&mdash;9.</P>
<P N="3">3. Another motive on all &s;uch as dearly love God's law, to e&s;pou&s;e its quarrel, in &s;uch a day of in&s;ult upon it, as we now behold is; there is a natural connection among he|re&s;ies; one gro&s;s war induces many: and when the flood gate is drawn, if it is not &s;peedily &s;hut down, an inundati|on may follow. The perfect connection and uniformity of the divine &s;y&s;tem is &s;uch, that an avowed oppo&s;ition to one branch of it, infers a &s;trong nece&s;&s;ity of denying all the re&s;t. Put <HI>nomo repente fit pe&s;&s;imus.</HI> Heriticks don't arrive at their full growth &s;uddenly. The &s;hocking here&s;y of this day, begun without any &s;en&s;ible deviation from the truth of God: viz. In avowing the grace of &s;alvation, to be "free grace." Which is the doctrine of God. But the ringleader of fal&s;|hood always did, and always will employ his &s;ubtilty and power to &s;uppre&s;s, or corrupt the purity of this doctrine; he well knew, if he could induce his omi&s;&s;aries to avow, and maintain the notion of &s;alvation for all men, and put it to the account of "free grace;" it would be a corruption of that doctrine, and &s;o &s;tand to its final &s;uppre&s;&s;ion. Both as it mu&s;t introduce various other errors, of the &s;ame ten|dency; and as its nature, being un&s;upportable from the &s;criptures, is to di&s;credit, and &s;o to extirpate that radical principle of Chri&s;tianity. The doctrine of free grace, in the ju&s;tification, and &s;alvation of &s;inners, according to the bible, is the eye-&s;ore of hell, as well as the object of en|mity to all wicked hearts. There is an a&s;&s;ential difference between the free grace of the bible, and the univer&s;al grace, now proclaimed. The former &s;uppo&s;eth moral ruin; the latter, human exi&s;tence. The former proceeds on the merit of attonement, according to the letter of the bible; the latter on &s;uch as men plea&s;e to a&s;&s;ign for it. The for|mer really makes new creatures; the latter has the word of men to make happy ones. The former is by God him|&s;elf re&s;trained to the &s;eed of ABRAHAM; the latter, in defi|ance of the word of God, is extended to all the &s;eed of fallen ADAM. The former powerfully cultivates the fear of God, and true holine&s;s; the latter evades both, and invites all licenciousne&s;s.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, This doctrine of univer&s;al &s;alvation, nece&s;&s;arily excludes that mo&s;t merciful doctrine of gracious election; which is e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to the certainty of &s;alvation for
<PB N="VI" REF="017812_0006_0FA31B16435DFFE0">
any at all. For if &s;alvation is certain to any, it mu&s;t be in con&s;equence of an unfru&s;trable purpo&s;e in God. And this, to &s;uch as cant de&s;erve it, mu&s;t be the effect of mere grace. So that their &s;alvation is wholly owing to election of grace. Rom. xi. 5. They are cho&s;en in Chri&s;t, according to the good plea&s;ure of his will. Eph. i. 3, 4, 5. Even the whole &s;y&s;tem of the go&s;pel is founded in the doctrine of election by mere grace. But the notion of univer&s;al &s;alvation, both excludes this doctrine; and therein the fir&s;t principle of the chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem. And yet this is not all, for if elec|tion is excluded, the ab&s;olute &s;overeignty of God is al&s;o excluded. And his claim to do what he will with his own, is al&s;o vacated. And of cour&s;e, there is no certain monu|ment of his inflexible righteousne&s;s. On this occa&s;ion e|very reader is de&s;ired to attend carefully to the bible, on the&s;e points? and for his help, to re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d candidly what the very judicious Mr. E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ISHA COLES, Mr. COOPER of Bo&s;ton, and Mr. AUGUSTUS TOPLADY, Vicar of Bro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d Hembury, Devon; and Chaplain to LORD HOLLAND; have written on the&s;e points. Who&s;e evidences for the truth of them were never ene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">vated, nor ever will be. And be&s;ides all the a|bove aberrations from the infallable &s;tandard; the free will of man, as the immediate &s;pring and rea&s;on of his &s;al|vation, mu&s;t again be atte&s;ted. And the po&s;&s;ibilty of re|pentance in hell, or of final &s;alvation without it, mu&s;t be p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">imed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> us. <HI>Cretat ille quem Deus dem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI> Or, which none can be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eve, till bereft of under&s;tanding. Nay the old doctrine of purgatory mu&s;t be &s;ubmitted to; and rea&s;on is as good, to &s;ubmit to all the re&s;t of that &s;y&s;tem The re|ply above mentioned has a pertinent remark <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the ca&s;e of tho&s;e, who for obvious rea&s;ons, are a&s;&s;igned to a tempo|rary damnation, by the univer&s;al device, and then to be relea&s;ed and admitted to glory. when they have &s;uffered e|qual to their &s;in. P. 25. 'Tis of this tenor, viz Then they are their own redeemers; they have &s;atisfied divine ju&s;tice by &s;uffering, and &s;o are not obliged to chri&s;tian|ity at all, for their &s;alvation. And if they take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in their own right, they mu&s;t hold it &s;o forever. Con&s;e|quently their &s;ongs of prai&s;e mu&s;t be to them&s;elves, not redeeming love. Whereas we know, for certainty, that the &s;ong of all in heaven, and their multitude &s;hall be perfectly innumerable, will be "&s;alvation to our God, and to the Lamb." Rev. vii. 9, 10. And that becau&s;e "he hath wa&s;hed us
<PB N="VII" REF="017812_0007_0FA31B170533D920">
from our &s;ins in his own blood." Indeed we need nothing to &s;et us right, in our judgment of the&s;e matters, but to attend to the infallible oracles, and no wonder, tho&s;e that &s;et them a&s;ide go a&s;tray.</P>
<P>The author of this piece has re&s;ted &s;ome time from his numerous vocations, to give &s;ome &s;criptural light, to the leading pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, by which &s;ome impo&s;e on, and abu&s;e the credulity of tho&s;e who attend to them. In do|ing which, he was confined to brevity, but has endeavor|ed plainne&s;s. His abhorrence of &s;uch u&s;e of the &s;acred text, as he thinks he di&s;cerns in the namele&s;s pamphlet before|mentioned, was very trying. He has endeavored however, in his remarks to be governed by plain text. And de&s;ires his readers candid attention to whatever he may judge is his main de&s;ign. He does indeed con&s;ider the matter be|fore us, to be too high, important, and intere&s;ting, to ad|mit of &s;oothing and leniency. No trimming! no daubing! &s;hould doubtle&s;s be the mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">to in &s;uch ca&s;es. God once en|joined on all his people, mo&s;t fearful &s;everities, again&s;t &s;uch as endeavored to &s;educe them from the purity of his com|mandments, in which they were bound to walk. Deut. xiii. in the 13th and following ver&s;es. they were directed in this manner; if thou &s;halt hear &s;ay, that certain men, the children of Beliel, have withdrawn the inhabitants of their city, to &s;erve other gods. i. e. are endeavoring to corrupt their faith and manners, and thou find the thing certain, that &s;uch abomination is wrought among you. Then the highe&s;t penal execution was to be made upon them. God in the mean time forbid his people to con&s;ent, or hearken at all to their mo&s;t pernicious device, or to exerci&s;e pity or lenity towards them. 8. v. To all which the word of God, as the &s;word of the Holy Spirit, now corre&s;ponds. Which &s;hould excite every Chri&s;tian to &s;tudy that word, and be much in prayer, that he may be able to weild it dexterou&s;ly. The holy apo&s;tle referring to it, &s;ays, II.

<HEAD>The Doctrine of Salvation for all Men put out of all Di&s;pute.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The fir&s;t PART.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t pretended divine authority, which has of late been advanced in &s;upport of the doctrine of &s;alvation for all men, is, I. Tim. ii. 4. The words are "Who will have all men to be &s;aved." The in&s;pired word here rendered &s;av|ed, is <HI>&s;ootbeenai,</HI> and is often rendered <HI>to be kept,</HI> or <HI>pre&s;erved.</HI> It is u&s;ed al&s;o, Matt. v. 23. to &s;ignify what JAIRUS wanted for his daughter, viz. to be healed, or pre&s;erved from dying. It is u&s;ed al&s;o Matt. xiv. 30. and it is rendered <HI>&s;ave,</HI> as in the text in que&s;tion; but every body knows what Peter meant by it, viz. "Lord pre&s;erve me from drowning. Again it is u&s;ed Mark v. 28. where al&s;o it is plain, the woman afflicted with her bloody i&s;&s;ue meant, that &s;he &s;hould be healed, that &s;o her health and life might be pre&s;erv|ed. The di&s;ciples al&s;o u&s;ed it, when chri&s;t told them LA|ZARUS &s;leepeth. They &s;ay then he will do well. Mean|ing it is a &s;ign he is recovering. And it is u&s;ed ever in the &s;ame form, as is the text before us, viz. <HI>Sootheenai.</HI> Acts xiv. 9. Re&s;pecting the impotent man of LYSTRA, his having faith to be healed, i. e. re&s;tored to the u&s;e of his limbs. And &s;o we gain ea&s;y light about the &s;en&s;e of this word as u&s;ed in Matt. xxiv. 22. Where it is rendered <HI>&s;aved,</HI> as in the text in que&s;tion; &s;hewing that the &s;edi|tious and murderous Fraction of the Jews, were &s;o &s;in|gularly &s;hocking and ruinous, that unle&s;s God had &s;hortened the time of their ravagings, they would have de&s;troyed e|very man of their nation; but God to pre&s;erve his elect among them, brought the Roman army on them; which brought the tragedy to a &s;peedy i&s;&s;ue; and &s;o <HI>&s;aved</HI> i. e. delivered and pre&s;erved his own elect. And as pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture &s;hould be always under&s;tood con&s;i&s;tently one with another: and as all judges of languages know that <HI>&s;oozoo,</HI> the theme of the word in que&s;tion, properly &s;igni|fies
<PB N="10" REF="017812_0010_0FA31B19592D3890">
<HI>to keep, pre&s;erve,</HI> &amp;c. And not always <HI>to &s;ave,</HI> as it means future ble&s;&s;edne&s;s. So the text in que&s;tion teach|eth us that God will have all men, in common, provided for, and pre&s;erved; that he may accompli&s;h the de&s;ign of his government and grace among them. And for this end, he has him&s;elf made all nece&s;&s;ary natural provi&s;ion.</P>
<P>Collateral evidences for this &s;en&s;e of the que&s;tion are:</P>
<P N="1">I. It is of &s;o much importance to the accompli&s;hment of divine purpo&s;es among men, that in common, they &s;hould be kept and pre&s;erved; that he him&s;elf has taken it em|phatically for his &s;tile: "The Pre&s;erver of men." Job vii. 20. P&s;alm xxxvi. 6.</P>
<P N="2">II. He has made it one of the principle laws of his moral government in this world, by which men are bound in all their conduct one towards another. Witne&s;s the 6th commandment.</P>
<P N="3">III. The text it&s;elf in que&s;tion indicates this &s;en&s;e; for it is allowed on all hands, that "the knowledge of the truth" is the qualification for final &s;alvation; which qua|lification is &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">anes expre&s;&s;ed as it is here, by "know|ing truth," often by "believing truth;" and by other e|quivalent expre&s;&s;ions: yet the&s;e qualifications are never placed after their object; viz. The &s;alvation to which they relate. No text of &s;cripture &s;ays <HI>be &s;aved,</HI> and <HI>believe.</HI> But the rever&s;e univer&s;ally. Con&s;equently, no man who forms his notion of &s;criptural things, by &s;criptural expre&s;&s;ions, would imagine that final &s;alvation is &s;o much as thought of, in the text in que&s;tion. What a &s;olici&s;m is this! "God will have all men to be &s;aved, and then come to the know|ledge of the truth." Or, "and &s;o come to the knowledge of the truth." And no man who holds faith of the divin|ity of the Bible will boldly cen&s;ure the form of its in&s;pir|ed expre&s;&s;ions. But &s;ubmi&s;&s;ivly allow the divine author under&s;tood the propriety of language, as well as the na|ture of its divine materials. And of cour&s;e, conclude, that as the qualification of "knowing truth," is in the in&s;pir|ed order of this text, placed after the doctrine of being <HI>&s;aved</HI>; therefore the notion of <HI>&s;aved,</HI> in this text means &s;omething previous to the knowledge and belief of the truth, and refers to it as its object. And this gives clear light.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="11" REF="017812_0011_0FA31B1A034B0098">I. Why the order of expre&s;&s;ions were &s;o placed, viz. Be|cau&s;e the nauture of their materials were in this order, in the nature of their ca&s;es: and &s;o it is beautiful.</P>
<P N="2">II. That though &s;ome form of this Greek word is often u&s;ed for final &s;alvation, yet it is often u&s;ed otherwi&s;e: and therefore we are never to conclude, that becau&s;e &s;ome form of the word <HI>&s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">zoo,</HI> is u&s;ed in a text of &s;cripture, it mu&s;t therefore intend final happine&s;s; for the contrary is cer|tain by the in&s;tances abovementioned.</P>
<P N="3">III. That when we read the word <HI>&s;ave,</HI> or <HI>&s;aved,</HI> in the tran&s;lation, we are never to conclude it nece&s;&s;arily means final happine&s;s: becau&s;e it is certain it often means o|therwi&s;e, as has been &s;hewed.</P>
<P N="4">IV. That a certain rule by which to judge of the im|port of this Greek word, and of the word <HI>&s;ave</HI> or <HI>&s;aved,</HI> in the tran&s;lation, is,</P>
<P N="1">1. Analogy, or agreement with the general run of &s;crip|ture, for in&s;piration u&s;eth words in &s;tricte&s;t propriety; keeping his eye on other texts where they are u&s;ed, and on the nature of the ca&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. When the doctrine of the text, and the previous qua|lifications dictate the &s;en&s;e of the&s;e words to be final hap|ne&s;s, we mu&s;t under&s;tand them &s;o, and never otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>Obj. 1. But it is here &s;aid that "God our Saviour wills" that all men &s;hould be &s;aved.</P>
<P>An&s;. 1. God our Saviour wills every thing, which he bringeth to pa&s;s in this world; and &s;o whatever is the ob|ject of his efficiency, it is nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould will its exi&s;t|ence.</P>
<P N="2">2. The word rendered <HI>will</HI> is <HI>theelei,</HI> which in, I. Cor. vii. 7. &s;ignifies <HI>to wi&s;h.</HI> And in Mark. x. 35. it &s;ignifies <HI>to de&s;ire.</HI> But the de&s;ireablene&s;s of an object, of it&s;elf, in no ca&s;e gives certainty of its exi&s;tence. And when this word is u&s;ed of God, it is certain it can imply no more nece&s;|&s;arily, even with re&s;pect to the &s;alvation of men, than what he declares Ezek. xviii. 32, that the perdition, even of the wicked, in it&s;elf, and for its own &s;ake, never plea&s;|eth him: his perfect benevolence, has no reli&s;h for that ob|ject, on its own account, but the contrary, viz. That they &s;hould "turn and live." But this never affects the de&s;ir|ed
<PB N="12" REF="017812_0012_0FA31B1AC4CDCC20">
object; for this object never takes place but in con&s;e|quence of ab&s;olute determination, and an&s;werable actual efficiency.</P>
<P>Obj 2. But I apprehend this text means, that God wills the knowledge of truth, in order to &s;alvation, though it is named afterward.</P>
<P>An&s;. This is natural enough; inferiors often have a vi|cious plea&s;ure in dictating to, and correcting their &s;uperi|ors; but it is quite &s;hocking when &s;uch as we are, have the front to correct their law-giver; implicitly &s;aying, "Lord I conceive thou ha&s;t not &s;poken the thing as it is; and as I pre&s;ume thou did&s;t really intend." J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">b indeed with e|vident propriety accu&s;eth BILDAD, for not having declared the thing as it is. Job xxvi. 3. But after God had &s;pok|en, he takes &s;hame to him&s;elf, for "uttering that he un|der&s;tood not, and &s;aying things too wonderful for him." JOB knew he was neither able nor worthy to di&s;pute a point with his Maker. Job ix. 14, &amp;c. And when he un|der&s;tood the mind of God, his an&s;wer was, "I know it is &s;o of a truth." Job ix. 2.</P>
<P>It has been proved already, that the word rendered <HI>&s;aved</HI> in I. Tim. ii. 4. is u&s;ed for very different purpo&s;es; and of cour&s;e, the hope of future happine&s;s, cannot be built on the u&s;e of it in this text. It has al&s;o been proved, that when|ever qualifications for future happine&s;s are named, in connecti|on with that end, as their object, the order of their nature is ob&s;erved; as, "he that believeth &s;hall be &s;aved, the pure in heart &s;hall &s;ee God, &amp;c." And never the rever&s;e. Therefore the "&s;aved" here expre&s;&s;ed, is not that &s;alvation which follows any knowledge of truth what&s;oever.</P>
<P>Another text on which &s;ome have harped, as hoping thereby to &s;erve a turn, is I. Tim. ii. 6. "Who gave him&s;elf a ran&s;om for all." The&s;e men conduct very ill, in catching a bit from wi&s;doms table, and running, as if for fear of cor|rection, nor do they pay due regard to that maxim of moral philo&s;ophy, viz. "Search and &s;ee if the&s;e things are &s;o." Otherwi&s;e they would ea&s;ily find a clue, which would guide them to a clear and con&s;i&s;tent under&s;tanding of this divine pa&s;&s;age, viz. That Paul, the writer of this epi&s;tle was a Jew; and had been thoroughly ver&s;ed and rooted in the Jewi&s;h notions of GOD and religion; according to that &s;ummary which our Saviour rea&s;oning with the woman of Samaria,
<PB N="13" REF="017812_0013_0FA31B1B8320B090">
couched in this aphori&s;m, "Salvation is of the Jews." which the apo&s;tle illu&s;trates, when he &s;ays, "Who&s;e are the Fathers, and of whom as concerning the fle&s;h, Chri&s;t came, to whom al&s;o belonged the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the &s;ervice of GOD, and the promi&s;es. Rom. ix. 4, 5. All this the Jews knew, and al&s;o that from <HI>their Zion,</HI> was the law to go forth; and the word of the Lord from <HI>their Jeru&s;alem.</HI> I&s;a. ii. 3. In con&s;equence of all this, the Jews appropriated every favourable con&s;ideration of God. Je&s;us Chri&s;t, Bible, religion, holy duties, and acceptible obedience to their own nation. This laid the foundation of their prejudi|ces and zeal again&s;t chri&s;tianity, and occa&s;ioned the primary and arduous labours of the apo&s;tles, to convince them that GOD was determined to &s;hew him&s;elf the GOD of other na|tions as well as of the Jews; and this point labored extreme|ly in the apo&s;tolic age. It was a capital article with the apo&s;tle Paul, e&s;pecially after he turned to the Gentiles, to root out this deep prejudice of his nation; for he knew that the go&s;pel and its ble&s;&s;ings going to the Gentiles did not at all prevent hope to the Jews. He is therefore often inculcat|ing this great and glorious benevolence of their GOD, to at|tract and gain them over to a like catholic &amp; benevolent mind. This is the obvious rea&s;on of Pauls u&s;ing this univer&s;al mono|&s;yllable ALL, exceeding often. He knew al&s;o that his dear &s;on Timothy was nearly related to the Jews, for his mother was a Jewe&s;s; and it &s;eems his father was a pro&s;elyte to them; and this &s;on had from a child, been brought up in the &s;tricte&s;t ob&s;ervance of the Jewi&s;h &s;y&s;tem. II. Tim. iii. 15. Now in view of this general &s;tate of things, ob&s;erve the tenor of this context.</P>
<P>The apo&s;tle a&s;&s;ures Timothy what principles he was po&s;&s;e&s;t of, viz. faith, as to what God had made him under&s;tand of his de&s;igns: and love, as of the &s;ame kind with what God had di&s;played in converting, and calling him to the go&s;pel mini&s;|try; and which mu&s;t therefore flow in the exten&s;ive channel of its original, the love of God, &s;o as by faith he believed Gods mind revealed towards poor Gentiles, &s;o his love drew him the &s;ame way; and all this he has in Chri&s;t Je&s;us. 1 Tim. i, 14. for though Je&s;us Chri&s;t was humanely of the Jews, yet his perfect merit was di&s;played, and his blood &s;hed without tho&s;e walls, as giving hope, and being full of promi&s;e to other nations as well as that.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="14" REF="017812_0014_0FA31B1C44B78CD0">2. The &s;ource of the&s;e principles was the grace of God, which could flow to Gentiles as freely as to Jews, becau&s;e his motive is in him&s;elf.</P>
<P N="3">3. He points out his pattern and example, Je&s;us Chri&s;t who came into the world, not Jewry only, but the world, his bu|&s;ine&s;s therefore was to &s;ave &s;inners. 15. v. not profe&s;&s;ing Jews only, but &s;uch as were mo&s;t notoriou&s;ly without de&s;erving, poor Gentiles. Implying at the &s;ame time all this was couched in chu&s;ing me, who&s;e ill-de&s;erving exceeded all: and in this he gave pattern to tho&s;e, who by men were judged to have no claim at all on the fountain of goodne&s;s, viz. the Gentiles. 16, v. On this he builds his eminent celebration of the only wi&s;e God, that he &s;hould di&s;play &s;uch exten&s;ivne&s;s of heart. 17. v. and then proceeds to his &s;olemn charge to his &s;on Timothy, 18, v. that he &s;hould not conduct him&s;elf according to the nar|row and contracted principles in which he had been educated; but keep the faith, 19. v. that his con&s;cience might be re|duced to the government of what God &s;hewed was his will, viz. that Gentiles &s;hould be equally the &s;ubjects of his mercy as the Jews. The apo&s;tle knew it always was the de&s;ign of God that Japhe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;hould dwell in the tents of Shem, Gen. ix. 27. and God had made him &s;ee and know that it was now to be fulfilled, in Gentiles being brought into the priviledges of the vi&s;ible church, he therefore urgeth it on his &s;on Timothy by every means as the determined object of divine coun&s;els: and there|fore a &s;ummary of what he and Timothy had to do, and this is the rea&s;on why he begins and proceeds in this &s;econd chapter, with this matter of his faith full in his eye; in&s;i&s;ting on it that Timothy &s;hould not confine his prayers to the Jews, either as a nation, or as a church; but &s;hould extend them con&s;tantly to all men, to Gentiles as much as Jews, and to kings which could not be among the Jews, at that time; the rea&s;on he a&s;&s;igns for all this, is, for this plea&s;eth God, 3, v. who&s;e will is, that all tho&s;e priviledges tending to &s;alvation, &s;hould be extended to Gentiles, ju&s;t as they u&s;ed to be indulged to the Jews; for he now intends Gentiles &s;hall be &s;aved as well as Jews, 4, v. and therefore they mu&s;t have the means of knowing the truth, And then crowns all,</P>
<P N="1">1. With a mighty argument to his purpo&s;e, drawn from the unity of the divine nature, 5 v. as if he had &s;aid, there is but one God; the Gentiles are as much his creatures as the Jews, &amp; his &s;ufficiency of power and grace are as equal to their ca&s;e, as to that of the Jews, according to Rom. iii. 29. and they have as much to attract his good will.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="15" REF="017812_0015_0FA31B1D03307B88">2. He argueth equally from the onene&s;s of mediator&s;hip; there is but one mediator, and he always propo&s;ed his object to be world, not Jewry only; nay the place of his death, be|ing without the walls of Jeru&s;alem, as well as the avowed de|&s;ign of his mi&s;&s;ion, had an eminently promi&s;ing a&s;pect to the Gentiles. yea,</P>
<P N="3">3. The object of his mediator&s;hip in this world, determines the &s;ame point; this was not Jews, but Men. 5, v. now Gen|tiles are men, as well as Jews; therefore for Gentiles he gave him&s;elf a ran&s;om, as well as for Jews, and &s;o it appears from the tenor of the whole conte&s;t, that by giving him&s;elf a ran&s;om for all, 6, v. there is no de&s;ign to &s;hew the efficacy of his death, as to the number of its individual objects; but that its general ob|ject was as much Gentiles as Jews, it will be proved to certain|ty, in the &s;equel, that every individual among either Jews or Gentiles were never actually &s;avingly benefitted by that ran|&s;om nor ever will be, but that the Gentiles had equal advan|tages by it as the Jews, and as this is evidently the de&s;ign of the text; what folly, mu&s;t it appear for any to ri&s;k his imagi|nary expectation of eternal life, on this ALL? which has no re&s;pect to the individual objects of the ran&s;om; but only af|firms an equal general re&s;pect to Gentiles, as to Jews, to in|duce Timothy to comport with the revealed will of God in that ca&s;e; and no longer re&s;train his views, prayers and labours to Jews only, as &s;uppo&s;ing they were the only objects of that ran|&s;om; intended equally for others, as for them.</P>
<P>Another text of &s;cripture which &s;ome lean upon, who &s;eem to want more &s;upport to their hope, than the God of hope has given them, is, I Tim. iv. 10. which is thus rendered, "the living God, who is the &s;aviour of all men". On which we &s;hould ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="1">I. That the word rendered &s;aviour in this text is <HI>&s;oofl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">as,</HI> which is commonly rendered by &s;ervator, i. e. keeper, or pre|&s;erver, and not by &s;alvator, which indeed is &s;aviour, and that God is eminently the pre&s;erver of men, and therefore of all men, in common, is witne&s;&s;ed by Job vii. 20. and by Neh. ix. 6. where the pre&s;erving of every thing in heaven earth and &s;ea, is equally a&s;cribed to him, and the p&s;almi&s;t al&s;o &s;ays, "thou pre&s;erve&s;t man and bea&s;t", P&s;al. xxxvi. 6. by which we may determine, the &s;aviour&s;hip named in this, I. Tim. iv. 10. is equally di&s;played on bea&s;ts as men; yea, on the whole material creation, and as <HI>Sue<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tus</HI> ob&s;erves in his war, Exer.

angels and devils, we &s;ee then what ground tho&s;e build on who expect univer&s;al &s;alvation from this text.</P>
<P N="2">II. It is not the manner of the &s;cripture, to a&s;cribe the &s;alvation of men, immediately to the fir&s;t per&s;on in the &s;a|cred Three. It is not con&s;i&s;tent with the revealed order of operation, with tho&s;e &s;acred per&s;onalities. But the &s;tile "living God," of whom the Saviour&s;hip of this text is pre|dicated, is known to be the emphatical di&s;tinction of the fir&s;t per&s;onality. By Mat. xvi. 16. "Thou art Chri&s;t, the &s;on of the living God." Al&s;o by John vi. 69. "We be|lief and are &s;ure, thou art that Chri&s;t the &s;on of the living God." It therefore follows that &s;uture &s;alvation is not &s;o much as thought of in this text.</P>
<P N="3">III. Tho&s;e who build their hope of univer&s;al &s;alvation on this text, mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e, either that &s;ome are &s;aved without be|lieving, or that the &s;alvation of believers is a different thing in it&s;elf from that of others, becau&s;e this text &s;ays "he is the the Saviour of all men, e&s;pecially of tho&s;e who believe". There is &s;omething in the &s;alvation of believers, according to tho&s;e men, &s;pecially di&s;tinct from that of others, and it mu&s;t be their having &s;aith, which &s;ome who are &s;aved have not, or in the quality of their &s;alvation, whereas in the true &s;en&s;e of this text, there is no difficulty; for God is indeed the pre&s;erver of all men; but he e&s;pecially watcheth over, and cares for &s;uch, as by believing put their tru&s;t in him, &s;o it appears, tho&s;e who flatter them&s;elves about a univer&s;al &s;alvation, have no ground at all in this text.</P>
<P>In the next place our attention is called to a text of &s;crip|ture upon which &s;ome venture their univer&s;al building, right or wrong; &amp; which they have forced into the &s;ervice of their i|maginition, and it is, I. John ii, 2. "He is the propitiation for our &s;ins, and not for ours only, by al&s;o for the &s;ins of the whole world." All we have to do here is to find the mind of God, in the&s;e la&s;t words, "the whole world." Now this expre&s;&s;ion is u&s;ed variou&s;ly in the Bible; let us carefully at|tend to it. The word in this text rendered <HI>world</HI> is <HI>ro&s;mos.</HI> But this word in Rom. xi. 12. means the Gentiles, exclu|&s;ive of the Jews, as any one may &s;ee. But then we begin to &s;ee that this word in the text in que&s;tion may not mean every body. And Mr. LEIGH, Critc. Ver. Says it means the Gentiles in oppo&s;ition to the Jews. It is certainly u&s;ed in John. xv. 18. &amp;c. For only a part of mankind; which will appear by turning to the pa&s;&s;age. For it is u&s;ed as a di|&s;tinction
<PB N="17" REF="017812_0017_0FA31B1E82F69F08">
for &s;uch as oppo&s;ed the Apo&s;tles. So we have an|other evidence, it does not mean all men, in John xvi. 8. The &s;ame word is expre&s;sly limited to unbelievers; exclu|&s;ive of all who believe in Chri&s;t;&mdash;&s;o in John xiv. 17. It is u&s;ed for &s;uch as cannot receive the &s;pirit of truth; exclu&s;ive of tho&s;e who receive him, and in the 17, v. of the &s;ame chapter, for all except the di&s;ciples, of cour&s;e this word don't nece&s;&s;a|rily mean all men it is u&s;ed with like limitation, John xv, 19. and xvii, 9, v. it means tho&s;e for whom the &s;aviour of man did not &s;o much as a&s;k for &s;alvation, and in I. Cor. vi, 2. it means only &s;uch as &s;hall be finally judged by the &s;aints, in Heb. xi, 7. he means only &s;uch as were condemned by Noah's conduct in building the ark, it is &s;aid with like limitation, II. Pet. ii. 5.</P>
<P>But we &s;hall be told the expre&s;&s;ion in this, I. John ii, 2. is much more emphatical, it is <HI>peri co ou tou Ko&s;mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. For the whole world.</HI> Yet we &s;hall &s;oon &s;ee to certainty, that other texts of equal authority prove, that this phra&s;e is no foundation for the notion of univer&s;al &s;alvation. We are told, Rom. i. 8. that the faith of the Roman Chri&s;tians was &s;poken of "throughout the whole world." And yet every body knows, that tho&s;e who &s;it in darkne&s;s, and &s;aw no go&s;pel-light; even whole nations, who at that day, had neither heard, or thought of the chri&s;tian faith, are not included in this ex|pre&s;&s;ion. Of cour&s;e, it is ra&s;h, and dangerous, for creatures of ye&s;terday, and going before an inflexible and righteous judge, to build their hope of univer&s;al &s;alvation on an ex|pre&s;&s;ion which the &s;criptures u&s;e in a limited &s;en&s;e. "The whole world" through which the faith of a few believers at <HI>Rome,</HI> was celebrated, at that time, could not likely be more than the "Roman empire;" and it is probable that &s;everal he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">then nations within that monarchy, never heard, thought, of concerned them&s;elves at all about the faith of a few individuals at <HI>Rome.</HI> Yet in &s;uch a limited &s;en&s;e is this phra&s;e u&s;ed in the holy word. See I. John v. 19. "The whole world lieth in wickedne&s;s," and yet in the &s;ame ver&s;e he expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf, the Parthian chri&s;tians, and all who are of God. So far therefore is this expre&s;&s;ion from &s;erving the purpo&s;e of tho&s;e who in a very mi&s;taken manner confide in it. Many other &s;criptures of the &s;ame &s;en&s;e which u&s;e the word <HI>all</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>the whole,</HI> are evi|dently u&s;ed, with like re&s;triction.

And every body knows the whole

of any thing, is all of that thing; and all is the whole; and are u&s;ed &s;o, except where re&s;triction in their import is &s;ufficiently made manife&s;t. Of cour&s;e, no con&s;iderate man will draw conclu&s;ion, ab&s;olutely univer&s;al, from univer&s;al expre&s;&s;ions, till he finds whether the &s;ame authority or the nature of the ca&s;e, has not re&s;trained their real import. We may &s;ee an in&s;tance in Luke ii. 1. "There went out a decree from Cae&s;ar Augu&s;tus, that all the world &s;hould be taxed." And yet it is obvious, that no more can be meant, than &s;uch parts of the world, as were under CAESAR's juri&s;|diction; which though it was exten&s;ive, yet far, very far from being ab&s;olutely univer&s;al. Ju&s;t &s;o it is with regard to the &s;ubjects of the chri&s;tian propitiation. They &s;hall be a number beyond the po&s;&s;ibility of numerical calculation. Rev. vii. 9. Yet no more than were elected to &s;alvation from among men, and were called, ju&s;tified and &s;anctified, as will be proved hereafter. Another univer&s;al phra&s;e we have Mat. iv. 8. which is nece&s;&s;arily re&s;trained, by a very figurative meaning. It is &s;aid the Devil &s;hewed to our Sa|viour "all the kingdoms of the world." But there is no &s;pot in the univer&s;e which gives advantage to any corporeal eye-&s;ight to &s;ee &s;o much; nor any vi&s;ive faculty in nature &s;ufficient for it.</P>
<P>So it is certain that none of tho&s;e who try to confide in the univer&s;al form of expre&s;&s;ion, in the text in que&s;tion; can give them&s;elves any a&s;&s;urance of &s;afety in it, we find an in&s;tance of this kind of expre&s;&s;ion in Rev. iii. 10. "I will keep the from the hour of temptation, which &s;hall come on all the world, no doubt this hour of temptation was that mo&s;t &s;hocking &s;cene of per&s;ecution, practi&s;ed by heathen Romans, again&s;t chri&s;tia|nity, for above two hundred years before Con&s;tantine the great, in what a re&s;trained &s;en&s;e is every man obliged to under&s;tand this expre&s;&s;ion; when, long and bloody as it was, it could ex|tend no further than the bounds of the Roman Empire? ano|ther in&s;tance of a like limited &s;en&s;e, to a like unlimited phra&s;e is in Rev. xiii, 3. and all the world, wandered after the bea&s;t, but the vii, v. &s;ays he made war with the &s;aints, did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he &s;aints wander after the bea&s;t? no &s;urely! or if they did, did the bea&s;t make war with &s;uch as wandered after him? then this univer&s;al expre&s;&s;ion, can't be under&s;tood univer&s;ally, we can get nothing then, drawing conclu&s;ions in &s;uch ca&s;es, which the Bible it&s;elf, will not warrant, nor the common &s;en&s;e of con&s;iderate men, &s;upport.</P>

<P>The truth of the whole affair is this; this epi&s;tle was written to &s;uch Jews, as had been driven out of their own country by former per&s;ecutions, and large numbers of them had found &s;anctuary in Parthia, a country far from their own land, in the ea&s;tern part of A&s;ia, and having no communication with their native country, nor means to know how it fared with chri&s;tians there, &s;ince they left that land, and their brethren di&s;tre&s;&s;ed with per&s;ecution, in&s;piration directs this apo&s;tle, to write them this epi&s;tle to inform them what the father of light had taught them, &s;ince their expul&s;ion, and how the chri&s;tian intere&s;t &s;uc|ceeded, and among many documents, he tells them that chri&s;ti|anity was yet triumphant, not only among the Jews in a mea|&s;ure, but al&s;o among the Gentiles; in&s;omuch that contrary to a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> their old traditions, the true religion obtained, and remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins was granted equally to the Gentiles, as to the Jews, &s;o that the propitiation was applied to, was evidently as effectual for the re&s;t of the world, as it was at fir&s;t for tho&s;e Par|thians, and many others among the Jews, therefore he &s;ays, "not for our &s;ins only, but for tho&s;e of the whole world," that is, ju&s;t &s;o for others wherever its doctrine comes, as it was at fir&s;t for us.

As &s;urely therefore as the Bible is a &s;y&s;tem, con&s;i&s;tent with it&s;elf, or with its faithful and univer&s;al executor, divine pro|dence; &s;o &s;urely this and no more than this, is the true con|&s;truction of the text in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>Another pa&s;&s;age which has been wre&s;ted out of its evi|dent latitude to favor the de&s;ired univer&s;ality, is. Tit. ii. 11. "For the grace of God, which bringeth &s;alvation hath ap|peared to all men." Every man who reads the Bible, and is attentive to what he reads, may ob&s;erve this text refers to time then pa&s;t, "hath appeared." But to all &s;uch leaders, it is evident enough, that at that time, the Bible and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> contents, had appeared to but a very few of mankind. And &s;o it is certain at fir&s;t &s;ight, that the device of &s;alvation for all men univer&s;ally, has no &s;upport of this text. It was indeed true then, and &s;o it is &s;till, that wherever the Bible comes, it appears plainly enough to all who are rational|ly attentive to what they &s;ee in it, that it is a &s;cheme of grace, very free grace: and that eternal &s;alvation is its ob|ject. And that by its grace, the wor&s;t of men, may happily attain to that object. But it is ju&s;t as evident from all parts of this divine &s;y&s;tem, that it never de&s;igned every indivi|dual to that happine&s;s, as it is from the letter of this text, compared with tho&s;e times, that they had not attained to it then.</P>
<P>The next object of our attention mu&s;t be a pa&s;&s;age in Eph. i. 10. "That he might gather together in one, all things in Chri&s;t, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth."

<P N="2">2.

<P N="1">1. Holy angels in heaven are not &s;o gathered into Chri&s;t, and made to center in him, as &s;ome men, and all tipical things are.</P>
<P N="2">2. An infinite multitude of things on earth, be&s;ides all bea&s;ts are nece&s;&s;arily excluded from the meaning of both the&s;e texts. Be&s;ides, one character of devils, is, that they "go to and fro in the earth, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> walk up and down in it. Job i. 7. Yet they are &s;o far from being included in the import of the&s;e texts, that they do not de&s;ire it, their de|&s;tiny will not admit of it, and divine ju&s;tice forbids it.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is evident that all things ab&s;olutely in heaven and earth cannot be included in the de&s;ign of the&s;e texts; both becau&s;e a great many are naturally incapable of it; and be|cau&s;e it is ab&s;urd to be &s;uppo&s;ed of &s;ome other.

<P N="4">4. The above &s;entiments on the fir&s;t of the&s;e texts are confirmed by the &s;upplement in the 11th v. viz. In whom <HI>al&s;o</HI> we, the Ephe&s;ian &s;aints, "have obtained an inheritance." This <HI>al&s;o</HI> &s;hews that the Ephe&s;ian chri&s;tians were not in the above collection; for the &s;uppo&s;ition of it would make this pa&s;&s;age tautologous, and ab&s;urd.

So it is evident <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the notion of &s;alvation for all men, has no &s;upport at all from
<PB N="22" REF="017812_0022_0FA31B2242F03E38">
either of the&s;e texts. The next portion of inflexible truth, in which &s;ome are &s;eeking room for their notion of &s;alva|tion for all men, is in Rom. v. 18. "The free gift came upon all men."</P>
<P N="1">1. The a&s;&s;ertors of univer&s;al &s;alvation, ought to have been very &s;ure that the word <HI>all,</HI> certainly means every indivi|dual of the kind, before they place &s;uch importance on it in this text, or any other. But in order to gain &s;uch certain|ty, they mu&s;t make great alterations in the following &s;crip|tures, viz. Acts xxii. 15. Which &s;ays that Paul &s;hould be "God's witne&s;s to all men." But this is fully explained by the 21&s;t ver&s;e. "I will &s;end thee to the Gentiles." For when divine admini&s;trations and mi&s;&s;ions, which had been peculiar to the Jews, becau&s;e common to Gentiles with the Jews, then they were common to all men, becau&s;e Jews and Gentiles, were all men. Although there were in|numerable multitudes of both &s;orts which Paul never &s;aw; and to whom his te&s;timony never did, nor ever will arrive. E&s;pecially tho&s;e who never &s;aw him in life, and have &s;ince pa&s;&s;ed into eternity, without the advantage of it. So al&s;o I. The&s;&s;. ii. 15. "They are contrary to all men." Yet &s;urely not to them&s;elves! nor in general to their own nati|on; but to the Gentiles, whom the Jews di&s;pi&s;ed and op|po&s;ed in general; but not univer&s;ally, for &s;ome Gentiles were well accepted pro&s;elites. Al&s;o Eph. iii. 9. Paul was to make "all men &s;ee the fellow&s;hip of the go&s;pel-my&s;tery." Yet &s;urely, not &s;uch as he never &s;aw, nor who ever &s;aw or heard of him; which is much the greate&s;t part of human nature, both before and &s;ince. But it is endle&s;s, as well as needle&s;s, to multiply in&s;tances of the u&s;e of the&s;e univer&s;al phra&s;es in a very partial and limited &s;en&s;e. And is it the part of any rational being to venture eternity on &s;o preca|rious a foundation?</P>
<P N="2">2. But the true key to this text is the words <HI>even &s;o.</HI> For this text contains a noted parity between the fir&s;t and &s;econd Adam; &s;hewing the medium through which ju&s;tifi|cation flowed to &s;ome by the &s;econd Adam, was of the &s;ame kind, with that by which condemnation flowed to all men, from the fir&s;t Adam. But what was that medium in ca&s;e of the fir&s;t Adam? The an&s;wer is <HI>federal head&s;hip.</HI> Now put the words of equation, or corre&s;pondency, <HI>even &s;o</HI>; and then we &s;hall &s;ee the truth of the text, viz. As all who were in the fir&s;t federal head&s;hip, &s;uffered by the offence
<PB N="23" REF="017812_0023_0FA31B2303C36CB8">
of one; <HI>even &s;o.</HI> Ju&s;t &s;o, all who were in the &s;econd fe|deral head&s;hip, live by the &s;econd Adam. And this is the plain &s;en&s;e of another text by which many through inat|tention &s;eem to be &s;educed, viz. I. Cor. xv. 22. "For as in Adam all die, <HI>even &s;o</HI> in Chri&s;t &s;hall all be made alive." For a federal head&s;hip was the only mean of imputation, in the fir&s;t ca&s;e; <HI>even &s;o</HI> it was in the la&s;t. So that all tho&s;e who are in the covenant of works are dead in Adam: ju&s;t &s;o, all who are in the covenant of grace are alive in Je&s;us Chri&s;t. So it appears that the&s;e two <HI>alls,</HI> are mea&s;ured by the medium of connection with their re&s;pective princi|pal. And &s;o we &s;ee that want of attention to the word of truth, or a wor&s;e cau&s;e, has occa&s;ioned all the confidence about univer&s;al &s;alvation on this text of &s;cripture.</P>
<P>Another holy expre&s;&s;ion, which much again&s;t its own mind, has been pre&s;&s;ed into the &s;ervice of univer&s;al &s;alvation, is, Luke ii. 10. In which the angel &s;aid to the &s;hepherd, "I bring you good tidings of great joy, which &s;hall be to all people." The in&s;pired expre&s;&s;ion is <HI>panti too l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI> Which is <HI>omni populo</HI>; to every people. A very general expre&s;&s;ion. BEZA, &s;ays in Mat. iv. It is not &s;imply univer&s;al, but in|definite. And &s;o this univer&s;al particle is u&s;ed, I. Cor. x. 23. where the apo&s;tle &s;ays "all things are lawful for me." Of which every body knows it is not meant of ab&s;olute univer&s;ality. It is &s;everal times u&s;ed with like limitation, I. Cor. ix. 22. and exceeding often el&s;ewhere. So Chri&s;t is &s;aid to heal "all di&s;ea&s;es," Mat. ix. 35. That is, &s;ome of all kinds; to &s;hew that none exceeded him, either by being of long &s;tanding, or great malignancy. In a like ge|neral &s;en&s;e, the angel's tidings were matter of great joy, not to the Jews only, among whom the holy Babe was born; but to all people, to Gentiles as well as Jews, without one thought of re&s;pect to every individual of any people. So when any great good occurs to a country or people, it is matter of great joy, although a thou&s;and individuals are not benefitted by it; as independence to America: though male-contents count it the ae<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a of their ruin. Its being matter of great joy to all people, that the Me&s;&s;iah was born in Beth|lehem, is no evidence that every per&s;on will have &s;aving benefit thereby; it was matter of great joy to the angels them&s;elves; but they had no thought of &s;alvation thereby. But it being the very highe&s;t in&s;tance of benevolence, de|manded great joy from all people, without regard to &s;o lit|tle
<PB N="24" REF="017812_0024_0FA31B23C31A1140">
an object as per&s;onal benefit; though it were that of &s;alvation by it. In this view the pa&s;&s;age in que&s;tion agrees with all the re&s;t in the Bible; and with all the re&s;t of the Bible agrees to reject the crude imagination of &s;alvation for all men.</P>
<P>Another portion of con&s;i&s;tent truth which has been ad|duced to &s;upport the above anti&s;criptural notion of &s;alvati|on for all men, is, I. Tim. vi. 13. "I give thee charge in the &s;ight of God who quickneth all things." Doubt|le&s;s every judicious reader, will judge the a bettors of this notion of &s;alvation of men, are &s;traightened for encourage|ment from the Bible, when they alledge &s;uch a pa&s;&s;age as this for their &s;upport. But all who are taught of God to guard again&s;t dangerous &s;ubtilties; &s;hould be thankful that men are not able to bury &s;uch a &s;nare deep, nor guard it with one good divine evidence. The in&s;pired expre&s;&s;ion in this text is <HI>zooopoiountos ta panta. Who maketh all things alive.</HI> On which ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="1">I. This text relates not to men, but to things. At lea&s;t, no more to mankind, than to all other creatures, which re|ceive life and quickning from God, the univer&s;al Quickner. Therefore this &s;ame word is u&s;ed Rom. viii. 11. For the efficatious cau&s;e of the re&s;urrection; becau&s;e exerted on mere matter, to cau&s;e life and motion to commence where it was not. Again it is u&s;ed, I. Cor. xv. 36. as having equal re|&s;pect to the germination of wheat after &s;owing, as to the rai&s;ing of dead bodies at the la&s;t day. It is u&s;ed al&s;o, Rom. iv. 17. As importing the efficacy by which ability for coition was revived in Abraham; and by which crea|tion it&s;elf recieved exi&s;tence.</P>
<P N="2">II. The word here rendered <HI>quickneth</HI> &s;ignifies <HI>to make alive.</HI> And &s;o has no relation to the ca&s;e which it is named to &s;erve. And CHANICER, one of the ancients &s;ays, there is no place in the New Te&s;tament, where it does not &s;ignify, <HI>vitam accipere, qua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> quis non habebat.</HI> Leigh in verb. i. e. to recieve a life which the &s;ubject had not before. It is ad|mitable therefore that this text &s;hould be thought of, as a &s;upport to the above named doctrine.</P>
<P>Now we mu&s;t attend to what is named for the &s;ame pur|po&s;e in Rev. v. 13. The &s;um of which is, "every crea|ture in heaven, earth, and under the earth, and in the &s;ea, &s;aid, ble&s;&s;ing and honor and glory and power, be to him who &s;itteth on the throne, and to the Lamb for ever and

ever." And does the reader think that every great cele|bration of God and the Lamb implies the &s;alvation of all men? But we have often been told, that the argument which proves too much, doth in fact prove nothing at all. Now if all the actors in this notable triumph, are &s;uppo&s;ed to be the &s;ubjects of the great &s;alvation; then not only all men, but all the angels in heaven, nay all the bea&s;ts on earth, and mon&s;ters of the deep, are as much the &s;ubjects of that &s;alvation as men. Some indeed have &s;o far di&s;intangled them&s;elves from the re&s;traints of common &s;en&s;e, and al&s;o of the word of God, as to pretend &s;alvation finally for devils, but what have bea&s;ts, either by land or &s;ea to do with it? And it is as certain holy angels are not &s;aved by the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t. So that this argument engro&s;&s;eth much more than can be true; and con&s;equently an&s;wers no purpo&s;e at all; except to di&s;play a di&s;po&s;ition for trifling with &s;acred things, and to anticipate a certain &s;hame and confu&s;ion of face.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the word rendered <HI>Creature,</HI> in this text is <HI>Kti&s;ma.</HI> And I. Tim. iv. 4. u&s;ing the &s;ame words, &s;ays, "every crea|ture of God is good." Where it evidently means our daily food, or common means of nouri&s;hment. By which it might &s;eem, the triumph of the text in que&s;tion is &s;omehow a|&s;cribed to the material creation. And &s;o it is a figure of &s;peech called <HI>Anthro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">epathy,</HI> by which the pa&s;&s;ions and af|fections of men are a&s;cribed to inanimate things; which is ex|ceedingly common in the Bible. The prophet I&s;a. lv.c. 12. v. having commemorated many great works of God to his peo|ple in that &s;tate of the church; and given a&s;&s;urance that he would &s;end the Me&s;&s;iah to them, fir&s;t de&s;cribes their joy, and then carries over their affections to the material world, and &s;ays, "the mountains and hills &s;hall break forth into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ging; and all the trees of the field &s;hall clap their hands." Ju&s;t &s;o the text in que&s;tion employs the material creation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> prai&s;e of the Lamb's appearing to open the <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dex f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s,</HI> of book of God's decrees and purpo&s;es re&s;pecting his church. And it is truely admirable that the followers of theirs own <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ui tatnus,</HI> about &s;alvation for all men, have never called to mind that trees are a noted <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">roglyphic</HI> for men; and &s;o confidently &s;upported their cau&s;e by the la&s;t text above-mentioned, becau&s;e it is there expre&s;sly &s;aid "that all the trees &s;hall clap their hands" on the news of the Me&s;&s;iah's under|taking.

&s;upport the cau&s;e. And doubtle&s;s there will be time enough to advance them all before God's &s;ealed ones &s;hall be &s;e|duced. This &s;ame word is al&s;o u&s;ed James i. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. where the apo&s;tle draws a parallel between tho&s;e among men, whom God will accept to &s;alvation, and the fir&s;t fruits under the law. Now only the fir&s;t fruits, under the law were offer|ed to God; they were his portion of all the fruits of the field. And this was the figure of tho&s;e among men, who &s;hould be &s;aved. Therefore we read, Rev. xiv. 4. "The&s;e are they which follow the Lamb whither&s;oever he goeth; tho&s;e were redeemed from among men, being the fir&s;t fruits to God and the Lamb." Therefore,</P>
<P N="1">1. It appears, that the text in que&s;tion is &s;o far from &s;up|porting the doctrine of &s;alvation for all men, that it &s;ays not one word di&s;tinctly about men at all. But in order to celebrate the dying love of Chri&s;t, for his <HI>fir&s;t fruits</HI> among men; the creation in general is animated with &s;ongs, and made to &s;econd the &s;houts of tho&s;e who are redeemed in prai&s;e of their redemption.</P>
<P N="2">2. And the rea&s;on of this form of triumph is 3. v. becau&s;e inqui&s;ition had been made through all created nature, for &s;ome one, able to open the abovementioned book of God's de&s;igns, and execute its import; but none was found able, till the lion of the Tribe of Judah appeared. And as all creatures are &s;ome way intere&s;ted in the &s;overeign determ|inations of God concerning this world; &s;o the nature of their ca&s;e is repre&s;ented, by this univer&s;al triumph; import|ing now we &s;hall all know the true &s;tate of things, and the whole of divine coun&s;els about us: and as "the Lord is righteous in all his ways;" &s;o no fear of the con&s;equence; for if our nature and ta&s;te are not &s;erved, and fully &s;uited by every execution; yet two things are infallible; and both worthy of a God, and both worthy of highe&s;t acclamations from us all: viz. His own honor, and the general good of the creatures, are both &s;ecure.</P>
<P>Another portion of &s;cripture by which &s;ome indeavor to &s;upport their notion of &s;alvation, is, I. Cor. xv. 27. "He hath put all things under his feet." On which ob&s;erve,</P>

And &s;o this text is a comment on the words of Chri&s;t. Mat. xxviii. 18. "All power is given me, in heaven and earth." And can of cour&s;e, no more imply &s;alvation for all men, than for the brutal world, and holy angels. Be&s;ides,</P>
<P N="2">2. This con&s;truction of the text is confirmed by what fol|loweth; which &s;hews that nothing was excluded from this ab&s;olute &s;ubjection to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, but the Father only.</P>
<P N="3">3. This text verifieth the royal prophecy, P&s;alm vii. 6. "Thou made&s;t him," viz. Je&s;us Chri&s;t; "to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou ha&s;t put all things un|der his feet." Which confirms the object of this text, to be the material creation. And &s;o it is immediately exam|plified by the P&s;almi&s;t; 7 &amp; 8. v. "All &s;heep and oxen, yea and the bea&s;ts of the field; fowls of the air, and fi&s;hes of the &s;ea." Which may guard all people again&s;t the abu&s;e of this text.</P>
<P N="4">4. Therefore the ancients rendered this Greek word, not be obedient, as of intelligent &s;ubjects; but <HI>be ye &s;ubject,</HI> as implying mere ab&s;olute dominion; and &s;ome of them pa&s;&s;iv|ly, <HI>be ye &s;ubjected.</HI> And Heb. ii. 8. &s;upports this con&s;truction. "Thou ha&s;t put all things in &s;ubjection under his feet; and ha&s;t left nothing that is not put under him." Therefore &s;uch as &s;upport their notion of &s;alvation of men from this text, mu&s;t either mean that the material creation is the &s;ubject of chri&s;tian &s;alvation; or they u&s;e &s;cripture without con&s;ult|ing its import. But &s;uch as fear God, will not trifle with his word, nor carele&s;sly deceive their fellow men.</P>

<P>Now we &s;hould attend to a few Points, that we may &s;ee if the&s;e Things are &s;o.</P>
<P N="1">I. They &s;ay there is no text of &s;cripture which nece&s;&s;a|rily implies eternal puni&s;hment. And they in&s;i&s;t that neither the Greek <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ioon,</HI> or Hebrew <HI>gnolam</HI> doth &s;ufficienly prove a|gain&s;t them. Now though it will &s;oon be proved that the&s;e words inconte&s;tibly &s;ignifying ab&s;olute eternity often in the Bible; yet it is to be noted e&s;pecially of the fir&s;t of them, that it does not always &s;ignify &s;o; but &s;ignifieth the dura|tion of its &s;ubject, be the &s;ame longer or &s;horter. There|fore when the &s;ubject of which this word is predicated, is of interminable duration, either by its own nature, or by appointment, in all &s;uch ca&s;es the import of this word is nece&s;&s;arily eternity. This mu&s;t be further cleared by in&s;tances of its divine u&s;e.</P>
<P>As to the Greek <HI>aioon,</HI> and its derivatives, the reader may &s;ee the divine u&s;e of them in the following in&s;tances. Mat. vi. 13. u&s;eth it thus "for thine is the kingdom and the power, and the glory <HI>Ei&s;ten aiconas, forever.</HI>" Now if the rea|der judgeth that the &s;ubject, of which this word is pred<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ated here, viz.

<P>It is al&s;o u&s;ed Mat. xii. 32. de&s;cribing the nature and con&s;equence of the &s;in again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t; concerning which, this text &s;aith, "it &s;hall not be forgiven him, viz.

<P>Another in&s;tance of the u&s;e of this word is Mark iii. 29.

And it mu&s;t &s;tand as long as power and right attend it; but the power and right of God are coeval with his nature. So therefore is this &s;entence.</P>
<P>This word is again u&s;ed John iv. 14. "He who drink|eth of the water I &s;hall give him, &s;hall never thir&s;t;" i. e. thir&s;ting is excluded, or prevented to him, <HI>eis ton aioona, for|ever.</HI> And is not this a deliverance quite interminable.

<P>So al&s;o, in John vi. 51. If any man eat of the living bread which came down from heaven he &s;hall live <HI>eis ton aioona, forever.</HI> And if there is no end to <HI>forever,</HI> then eternity is the import of the word here al&s;o.</P>
<P>So John vi. 58. He that eateth of this bread which came down from heaven &s;hall live <HI>ais ton aioona, forever.</HI> If then the bread of life has eternity in its virtue, &s;uch import is in this word.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o u&s;ed John viii. 51. and confirmed with "verily verily, if any man keeps my &s;ayings he &s;hall never &s;ee death." The in&s;pired expre&s;&s;ion is <HI>eis ton aioona,</HI> and if to never &s;ee death; nece&s;&s;arily implies eternity of life: then &s;o this word means.</P>
<P>It is twice u&s;ed in John x. 28. "And I give them <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> aioonian, eternal life</HI>" and it is confirmed by adding, "and they

<P>Al&s;o John xi. 26. "Who&s;oever liveth and believeth in me &s;hall never die." The words are <HI>ais ton aioona.</HI> And if never to die nece&s;&s;arily implies eternity of life, then this word implies eternity.</P>
<P>Once more John xii. 34. "We have heard that Chri&s;t a|bideth <HI>ais ton aioona, forever.</HI> As plainly then as eternity is a&s;cribed to Chri&s;t; &s;o plainly it is imported in this word. LEIGH's Crit. Sac. in Verb. &s;ays it &s;ignifies <HI>Eternity.</HI> And that the ancients held that puni&s;hment eternal, on which this word was predicated. And this is evidently the &s;en&s;e of the word in the abovementioned. Mat. xii. 32. and Mark iii. 29.</P>
<P>And as to the Hebrew word <HI>Guolam,</HI> the critick above|named &s;ays it de&s;igns "ab&s;olute perpetuity, eternity;" when it affirms of God, or things in their own nature eternal; and it will be &s;till further proved in the &s;equel, that future puni&s;h|ment is &s;o. The abovenamed Reply ob&s;erves that the import of tho&s;e words is mea&s;ured by the &s;ubject to which they ap|ply; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f to the Jewi&s;h &s;tate of the church, or its ordinances; the mountains, &amp;c. The durability imported in the&s;e words is equal to that of their &s;ubject. So when they apply to God, his gracious covenant, or the future &s;tate of exi&s;t|ence, they import duration equal to their &s;ubject. And it has been proved by plain texts, that the above Greek word often nece&s;&s;arily means eternity. Therefore the &s;choolmen &s;ay, that wicked men are ju&s;tly puni&s;hed <HI>in eterno Dei,</HI> who have &s;inned <HI>in eterno Deo.</HI> i. e. They &s;hall be puni&s;hed through eternity, as mea&s;ured by God, who have &s;inned through their whole life here. And this Hebrew word certainly means eternity in the mo&s;t ab&s;olute &s;en&s;e in P&s;alm x. 16. "The Lord is king for ever and ever." And in Exod. xv. 18. "The Lord &s;hall reign for ever and ever." Be&s;ides,</P>
<P N="2">II. Sinful men are of a totally depraved nature, and a to|tally morally depraved nature; as &s;uch, cannot po&s;&s;ibly be happy; happine&s;s mu&s;t be according to con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s. If con&s;cience witne&s;&s;eth only of moral evil, it can only ac|cu&s;e without ce&s;&s;ation; and &s;o give &s;en&s;e of mi&s;ery. Be|&s;ides, &s;uch &s;ubject can receive nothing but penalty in a righteous government. And &s;o both from it&s;elf, and from the government over it, mu&s;t be mi&s;erable. And this ca&s;e
<PB N="31" REF="017812_0031_0FA31B2903ECC2C0">
mu&s;t be as durable, as the internal propen&s;ities of man. If then his time of probation is &s;pent in &s;inning, the nature of his ca&s;e will make him mi&s;erable as long as his nature la&s;ts.</P>
<P N="3">III. Such a nature, retaining its predominant propen&s;i|ties, cannot cea&s;e from &s;inning; its own propen&s;ities will act out their own nature; and of cour&s;e, &s;ins will, and mu&s;t encrea&s;e during exi&s;tence. And &s;o there will be the &s;ame &s;ort of rea&s;on for infliction of puni&s;hment, as at fir&s;t; and this is the natural &s;ubjective rea&s;on, for puni&s;hment at all, and for the eternity of it.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The demerit of &s;in, is mea&s;ured by its object, the direct object of &s;in, is the holy law, its ultimate object is the divine nature; both are of perfect, unlimitable, and &s;o eternal rectitude and goodne&s;s. Exactly an&s;werable thereto is the demerit of their contempt. But the &s;inning &s;ubject is very finite; con&s;equently puni&s;hment cannot be adequately endured, but by duration equal to its object. And this is the natural objective rea&s;on for the nece&s;&s;arily endle&s;s dur|ation of future puni&s;hment.</P>
<P N="5">V. Of &s;ome &s;inners it is &s;aid Heb. vi. that it is <HI>impo&s;&s;ible</HI> to renew them to repentance. And will any dare to hold, that it is not only po&s;&s;ible, but certain, that &s;alvation &s;hall be had, where God their Maker, has &s;aid it is <HI>impo&s;&s;ible</HI>?</P>
<P N="6">VI. They talk of &s;ome making atonement for their own &s;ins, by &s;uffering an an&s;werable &s;pace in hell. It will be no honor to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for &s;uch to arrive at, and dwell in heaven; for thereby they get only what they have earned, and de&s;erved. They do not arrive there by Je&s;us Chri&s;t's merit, but by their own. They have ballanced the account with divine ju&s;tice, by their own &s;ufferings. Perhaps the reader will judge this is another in&s;tance of the devils &s;cheme acted over again. "Ye &s;hall not &s;urely die, but ye &s;hall your&s;elves <HI>be as Gods.</HI>"</P>
<P N="7">VII. The following &s;criptures ab&s;olutely &s;ix the eternity of future puni&s;hment, viz. Mat. xxv. 46. "The&s;e &s;hall go away into <HI>Kolafin aioonion, everla&s;ting puni&s;hment. But the right|eous eis zooeen aioonian, into life eternal.</HI> The antithe&s;is fixeth the equality of the&s;e two repre&s;entations of eternity. The &s;ame word, which generally &s;ignifies eternity, as has been pro|ved, is equally u&s;ed for them both. Therefore they are both of equal duration.</P>

<P>And Rev. xiv. 11. &s;peaking of the wor&s;hippers of the bea&s;t faith, "The &s;moke of their torment a&s;cendeth, <HI>eis aioena<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> aio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nas,</HI> forever and ever;" as if eternity was multiplyed in|to it&s;elf, to denote an ab&s;olute incomprehen&s;ible duration, which mu&s;t be ab&s;olute eternity. But &s;ome may imagine the a&s;&s;ertors of univer&s;al &s;alvation do not mean to include Papi&s;ts But pray why not? are not Papi&s;ts men? And many of them far from being the greate&s;t &s;inners, for want of the cleare&s;t light. Be&s;ides, the&s;e Univer&s;ali&s;ts have adopted &s;ome badges of Popery, be&s;ides their acknowledgement of purgatory; which &s;hould induce them to be tender of their brethren the wor&s;hippers of the bea&s;t; however terrible the la&s;t men|tioned text is to all who &s;imbolize with them.</P>
<P>And Rev. xix. 3. &s;peaking of the &s;ame &s;ort of men, un|der the character of a great Whore who corrupted the earth, by corrupting the word of God, and &s;educing men; &s;aith.

A like emphatical de&s;cription of duration quite endle&s;s, as before.</P>
<P>Though there are innumerable pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, where|in God, who can not lie or deceive, has determined the point of the eternity of future puni&s;hment, yet the la&s;t to be named now is Rev. xx. 10. &s;aying, "And the devil who deceived them," viz. The innumerable multitude from all quarters of the earth, which &s;hall con&s;titute the army of Gog and Magog, "was ca&s;t into the lake of fire and brim&s;tone, where the bea&s;t and the fal&s;e prophet are, and &s;hall be tor|mented

Doubtle&s;s the&s;e therefore will not be &s;aved. And the rea&s;on of the ca&s;e, concludes again&s;t all their a|bettors. And &s;uch a have any mark of the bea&s;t, or fal&s;e prophet about them, had need be ware. For the durati|on of their puni&s;hment is quite interminable.</P>
<P N="3">III. The third of the&s;e mi&s;cellaneous &s;entiments is, God &s;wore in his wrath, that &s;ome &s;hould not enter into the re&s;t of Canaan. P&s;alm 95.11. But he has told us Heb. iv. 11. that their failure was example to us, by which to take heed lea&s;t we enter not the heavenly &s;tate, which was the an|titype of Canaan's re&s;t. If then that affair was all type of this; then the oath of God barrs entrance now, to the &s;ame &s;ort of men: and &s;o 'tis as impo&s;&s;ible all &s;hould be &s;aved, as the oath of God be broken.</P>

Pro|perty is founded in right. God is the vindicator, never the violator of right. If then Judas's right is there, he mu&s;t remain there, for "far be it from God, that he &s;hould do iniquity." Job xxxiv. 10. But then all men cannot be &s;aved; nor can Judas be relea&s;ed from his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; but of cour&s;e it mu&s;t be eternal.</P>

From this pri&s;on none can come forth, till they have paid the uttermo&s;t farthing. Mat. v. 25 But for a finite being as man, to pay the uttermo&s;t farthing of an infinite debt, nece&s;&s;arily employs eternity, as has been &s;hewed.

<P N="6">VI. Mat. xxvi. 24. Says of Judas "it had been good for him, if he had not been born." But if in any future period of duration, he &s;hould be di&s;charged from his own place, and enjoy the happine&s;s of the heavenly &s;tate thencefor|ward forever; then this text would be evidently not true; for a perfect ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, for a thou&s;andth part of that hap|py duration, mu&s;t be in &s;ome &s;en&s;e, infinitely better than ne|ver

<P N="7">VII. In Luke xvi. 26. it is &s;aid, "there is a great gulph fixed between the happy and the mi&s;erable." And it is a gulph which is unpa&s;&s;able. The in&s;pired words are <HI>Mega Cha&s;ma e&s;te nigneno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> i. e. <HI>firmi&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">um D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e utum,</HI> or <HI>a &s;tatute of God mo&s;t firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed</HI> &s;o firmly that it is quite inviol|able. But how then &s;hall any &s;oul come from among the mi&s;erable, as long as divine &s;ufficiency for maintaining this gulph continues?</P>
<P N="8">VIII. In Mat. xxv. 41. the final &s;entence of bani&s;hment from the pre&s;ence and enjoyment of God is in the&s;e words: "Depart from me ye cur&s;ed, into everla&s;ting fire prepared for the devil and his angels." On which we may note,</P>
<P N="1">1. The word in this &s;entence rendered everla&s;ting, is <HI>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ian,</HI> which has been proved already to &s;ignify eternal, in its utmo&s;t &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. And this notion of the word, is confirmed by its al|lowed derivation from <HI>aei,</HI> always, and, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on,</HI> being, natur|ally therefore implying <HI>to be always.</HI> And &s;urely <HI>always</HI> is forever.</P>
<P N="3">3 The word rendered cur&s;ed is <HI>Kateeramenoi,</HI> which is <HI>de|vored</HI>; finally and forever given up.</P>
<P N="4">4. This devotion is to the &s;tate, portion, and puni&s;hment of the devil and his angels. Of cour&s;e, while that &s;tate of puni&s;hment is the portion of the devil and his angels, the&s;e devoted &s;ouls mu&s;t inhabit with them. Either therefore the damnation of devils is limited, or that of wicked men is unlimited. For the latter are given up to the very &s;ame place and portion as the former.</P>
<P N="5">5. The very notion of <HI>burning</HI> in the&s;e figurative de&s;crip|tions of hell, implies &s;en&s;ible hopele&s;&s;ne&s;s, or knowledge of interminability of &s;uffering. If there was a po&s;&s;ible hope of e&s;cape, or terminability, the e&s;&s;ence of this idea of <HI>burning,</HI> would cea&s;e. Tho&s;e &s;ufferings would be very great, but not <HI>burning.</HI> That the notion of burning implies ab&s;o|lute de&s;paration, appears,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t By the purity between the burning fire, and the knaw|ing worm. Mark ix. 44. I&s;ai. lxvi. 24. They are of e|qual efficacy and duration. Make the fire quenchable, and the worm in&s;tantly cea&s;es to knaw. This worm is con&s;ci|ence
<PB N="35" REF="017812_0035_0FA31B2C02D4BB40">
&s;en&s;ible of guilt and puni&s;hment. But the remon|&s;trances of con&s;cience are always according to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ight from God. The wicked in this life have the fire and the worm, but not <HI>burning Fire,</HI> nor <HI>never dying Worm.</HI> But when the worm gets to be <HI>Outeleuta never to be fini&s;hed</HI>; then the fire al&s;o becomes burning fire.</P>
<P N="2">2. It appears from the corro&s;ivene&s;s of burning fire, that fire exi&s;ts in a thou&s;and in&s;tances, where it is not burning fire. But as &s;oon as it is burning fire, it corrodes. 'Tis ab&s;o|lute de&s;peration, or knowledge of interminability of &s;uffer|ing, that corrodes and totally de&s;troys all &s;elf enjoyment or hope; and this is ab&s;olutely burning. Therefore the Bible &s;peaks the thing as it is, everla&s;ting burning!</P>
<P>So the Univer&s;ali&s;ts have not only devi&s;ed an e&s;cape finally from the &s;ufferings to which GOD has a&s;&s;igned the wicked hereafter, but they have quenched the <HI>burning</HI> fire while they are in puni&s;hment, and al&s;o prevented the preying worm. But is not all this a daring oppo&s;ition to divine e&s;tabli&s;h|ment? And as penalty is the &s;upport of all law, &s;o they have by this means enervated, and made void the laws of GOD. And we know what is the portion of &s;uch&mdash;they &s;hall have their part taken out of the book of life, out of the holy city, and out of the ble&s;&s;ings written in the go&s;pel. And they who add their own imaginations to things writ|ten in the Bible, God &s;hall add to them the plagues writ|ten in the holy book. Rev. xxii 18&mdash;19. Nay,</P>
<P>GOD has expre&s;sly and repeatedly declared, That this burning fire <HI>never &s;hall be quenched.</HI> Mark, ix. 43, 44, 55, 48. al&s;o, I&s;aiah lxvi 24. In all which pa&s;&s;ages the immortality of the worm, and the unquenchablene&s;s of the fire, are exact parrellels, which is incon&s;i&s;tent with &s;alvati|on for all, and with any di&s;charge from puni&s;hment.</P>
<P N="11">XI. If &s;in in ve&s;&s;els of wrath fitted to de&s;truction, is quite connatural to them, then either they mu&s;t be converted in Hell, or never be di&s;charged from it: but conver&s;ion is a work of grace any where, and no &s;uch di&s;play of grace, can at all be expected, but according to the words of grace, in the Bible; but there is not one word in the Bible, about di&s;|playing &s;uch grace in Hell. Therefore there never will be any di&s;charge from that &s;tate of puni&s;hment.</P>
<P N="10">X. If it is nece&s;&s;ary for the glory of God that any &s;hould be puni&s;hed with de&s;truction from the pre&s;ence of the Lord, according to II. The&s;&s;. i. 19. then it is at lea&s;t, equally
<PB N="36" REF="017812_0036_0FA31B2CC2DB9910">
nece&s;&s;ary, that &s;uch de&s;truction &s;hould be everla&s;ting: But it is nece&s;&s;ary that &s;ome &s;hould be puni&s;hed with de&s;truction from the pre&s;ence of the Lord, this our adver&s;aries confe&s;s. Therefore it is at lea&s;t, equally nece&s;&s;ary, that &s;uch de&s;truc|tion &s;hould be everla&s;ting. For,</P>
<P N="1">1. The word of in&s;piration in this text is <HI>aioonion,</HI> which, as has been proved, is genuine evidence, that the judgment of God is, that it &s;hould be everla&s;ting.</P>
<P N="2">2. Every rea&s;on for puni&s;hing any with de&s;truction from the pre&s;ence of the Lord at all, makes it at lea&s;t, as nece&s;&s;ary to continue the &s;ame execution forever, if the execution of this puni&s;hment at fir&s;t, was nece&s;&s;ary as a reward of evil deeds, then as long as evil deeds continue, the rea&s;on of this execution continues. But there can be none but evil deeds in Hell; therefore the rea&s;on of that puni&s;hment can never cea&s;e. If this puni&s;hment was inflicted at fir&s;t, in honor to divine ju&s;tice, then as long as divine ju&s;tice remains the &s;ame, &s;o long the rea&s;on for this punini&s;hment remains. If this execution was made at fir&s;t to te&s;tify Gods abhorrence of &s;in, then as long as that abhorrence remains, this execution mu&s;t remain. God, right, and the moral nature of things, never change: whatever therefore, in the nature of God, of right, or of morality, induced and ju&s;tified the fir&s;t executi|on in this ca&s;e, will at lea&s;t, ju&s;tify it forever. <HI>I I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;om Canbus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">adem e&s;t Ratio,</HI> in like ca&s;es the &s;ame rea&s;on obtains. No eva|&s;ion can be made from this argument, but that the damned, will in &s;ome period of their mi&s;ery cea&s;e from &s;inning, and &s;o may be di&s;charged. Again&s;t which &s;uppo&s;ition the following things lie, viz.</P>
<P N="1">1. Such &s;uppo&s;ed ce&s;&s;ation from &s;inning mu&s;t be from a motive <HI>ab <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tra,</HI> or <HI>ab extra, from within, or from without</HI>; from within, it cannot derive without a new heart, and there is not one indication in the word of God, or nature of things, that a new heart will be given in hell, if there was, the neare&s;t pro&s;pect of good to &s;ome men, would be their &s;peedy arrival among the damned; and from without, this &s;uppo&s;ed ce&s;&s;ation from &s;inning cannot derive: both becau&s;e the applicati|ons of redemption are peculiar to this life, according to the Bible; and becau&s;e the wrath of God, and nothing el&s;e is re|vealed re&s;pecting the damned; and la&s;tly, becau&s;e the oath of an unchanging God barrs all hope, Heb. iii. 11.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another thing which lies again&s;t the above &s;uppo&s;ition is, their old &s;inful habits having full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their nature,
<PB N="37" REF="017812_0037_0FA31B2D82CFBDE8">
mu&s;t continue, while that endures; al&s;o their old &s;ins, having in their nature eternal demerit nece&s;&s;arily bind to an eternity of &s;uffering. The intrin&s;ic malignity of all &s;in is mea&s;ured, by the revealed dignity of its object. An offence committed again&s;t the known authority, and dignity of a prince, by his &s;ubject, differs va&s;tly in its intrin&s;ic malignity and demerit, from that of the &s;ame action materially again&s;t a pea&s;ant. As much gro&s;&s;er is the ca&s;e before us, as God is above a fellow &s;inner; now this difference is in all views quite infinite. Such therefore is the demerit of all &s;ins again&s;t God, and how &s;hould the &s;ubject po&s;&s;ibly open a new account, while the old re|mains nece&s;&s;arily unballanced.</P>
<P N="3">3. The very nature of all di&s;appointed, di&s;plea&s;ed and tor|mented &s;pirits, is &s;elf-vindication, &s;elf-excu&s;ing, and to con|ceive accu&s;ing allegations again&s;t the &s;ource of their trouble. This is obvious both to ob&s;ervation and &s;en&s;ation; but all this is e&s;&s;entially &s;in, and wickedne&s;s again&s;t God; yet &s;uch &s;in and wickedne&s;s mu&s;t from the nature of the ca&s;e, eternally employ the damned, without exception of one &s;en&s;ation, or act of volition; till they become cordially plea&s;ed with the pains of damnation, and if this is perfectly impo&s;&s;ible, then it is equally &s;o, that &s;uch &s;in and wickedne&s;s &s;hould cea&s;e, or their con&s;equently de&s;erved puni&s;hment.</P>
<P N="11">XI. If eternity of puni&s;hment, on &s;uppo&s;ition of its certainty, is an infinite good in the intelligent &s;y&s;tem; then to deny the eternity of puni&s;hment, is to deny what is an infinite good in the intelligent &s;y&s;tem. But an eternity of puni&s;hment, &s;uppo&s;|ing it to be certain, is an infinite good in the intelligent &s;y&s;tem. Therefore to deny the eternity of future puni&s;hment, is to deny what is an infinite good in the intelligent &s;y&s;tem. Now that future eternal puni&s;hment is &s;uch infinite good, &s;hall be proved.</P>
<P N="1">1. If for thinking beings, &s;ubjects of a &s;upreme perfect government, to be made circum&s;tantially acquainted with, and well a&s;&s;ured of the mind of their Supreme, and the de&s;igns of his government is an infinite priviledge; and an infinite priviledge is an infinite good; then the con&s;equence avails: But for &s;uch &s;ubjects to be &s;o informed and a&s;&s;ured of the mind and de&s;igns of their Supreme, is an infinite priviledge, and &s;uch priviledge is an infinite good: Therefore future eternal puni&s;hment is an infinite good in the intelligent &s;y&s;tem. So that if it was not made certain, 'tis mo&s;t de&s;irable that it &s;hould be &s;o. But a belief of divine perfections, and that
<PB N="38" REF="017812_0038_0FA31B2E43ACCBC0">
his government, and whole plan, are ju&s;t like him&s;elf, in propriety and righteou&s;ne&s;s, implies a belief, that every de|&s;irable and perfect good for his &s;y&s;tem is contained in it; and that for &s;uch &s;ubjects to be &s;o made acquainted with, and a&s;&s;ured of the mind and de&s;igns of their Supreme, and of his univer&s;al dominion, is a priviledge, will not be de|nied; nor will any deny it to be an infinite priviledge, who believe &s;uch Supreme to be infinite in all views, and who believe the nature and de&s;ign of his government to be of infinite importance to the &s;ubjects of it. And doubtle&s;s the &s;ame light will determine all who have it, that &s;uch an infinite priviledge is an infinite good. But then it fol|lows, that future eternal puni&s;hment is an infinite good, in the intelligent &s;y&s;tem, as plainly as either the nature and rea&s;on of the ca&s;e, make it evident to be true; or as the word of GOD &s;hews it to be certainly a part of his plan. Both which have been proved already.</P>
<P N="2">2. That which has infinite weight, from its own nature, to prevent infinite evil, both moral and penal, and to com|mend and urge infinite good, both &s;ubjectivly and objectiv|ly, to entelligent creatures, is it&s;elf an infinite good to them: But the con&s;ideration of future eternal puni&s;hment, is from its own nature, of &s;uch infinite weight; therefore it is an infinite good to &s;uch creatures. For it is an argument of infinite weight again&s;t all &s;in and its con&s;equence; and for all good and happine&s;s forever. Con&s;equently tho&s;e who deny it, remove a mean of infinite weight, for the good of mankind and the glory of God.</P>
<P N="3">3. If future eternal puni&s;hment has influence to the honor of God, and of all divine objects; it is an infinite good; but the former is true; therefore &s;uch puni&s;hment is an infi|nite good in the &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is an everla&s;ting monumental evidence, that there is no unrighteou&s;ne&s;s in God. And that which &s;upports the honor of infinite righteousne&s;s, truth, and goodne&s;s, is it&s;elf, for that rea&s;on, infinitely good. God has well informed men of the nature and demerit of &s;in; and has given a&s;&s;urance that in ca&s;e of di&s;obedience, he would a&s;&s;ign them, to this very puni&s;hment; which is therefore the proof in fact, that "ju&s;t and right is <HI>be.</HI>" Whereas the denial, and removal of this evidence, ca&s;ts the reproach of fal&s;hood, and delu&s;ion on the nature, name and word of God.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="39" REF="017812_0039_0FA31B2F03A5A3B8">2. Everla&s;ting puni&s;hment reflects honor on the laws of God. It is penalty &s;upports the honor of all laws. Divine laws being infinite in all views, their honor can be &s;up|ported by nothing le&s;s than puni&s;hment an&s;werable to their nature.</P>
<P N="3">3. It reflects light on the nature, and &s;hews the rea&s;on, of &s;uch chri&s;tian atonement as the Bible di&s;cribes. The a toner being of infinite dignity, could not be &s;ubjected to &s;uch &s;ufferings, but on that &s;uppo&s;ition of the infinite deme|rit of &s;in, which is the nece&s;&s;ary implication of eternal pu|ni&s;hment; That one who was God-man mu&s;t endure as Je&s;us Chri&s;t did, has the &s;elf-&s;ame occa&s;ional rea&s;on, as e|ternal puni&s;hment has. They reflect light on each other, and doubtle&s;s mu&s;t &s;tand and fall together.</P>
<P N="4">4. Eternal puni&s;hment reflects &s;uch an honor on that ho|ly law, who&s;e penalty is there executed, as it is not po&s;|&s;ible it &s;hould have on any other &s;uppo&s;ition. It &s;peake that law, who&s;e penalty it is, to be infinite in excellency. Whereas a &s;mall or temporary puni&s;hment, degrades the law, who&s;e penalty it is. Therefore we &s;ee every mitigation of future puni&s;hment, relaxeth moral bonds.</P>
<P N="5">5. Therefore without this doctrine of future eternal pu|ni&s;hment; the honor of all divine attributes, the value of the atonement, the dignity of the holy law, the truth of the Bible; all fail, and are depreciated. And if the mean of all the&s;e infinite honors is an infinite good, in the mo|ral &s;y&s;tem; then eternal puni&s;hment is an infinite good in the moral &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P N="6">6. The &s;criptural notion of future puni&s;hment, ju&s;tifies, and honors the faith, hope and conduct of all true believ|ers. Their faith was founded in what they &s;aw in the Bi|ble; this gave &s;pring to their hope, and holy lives, and &s;ufferings. If the Bible is never honored with this future execution; it infinitely weakens and di&s;honors all their re|ligion. For one rea&s;on of their religion was a refuge from that eternal &s;torm. Heb. vi. 18. I&s;aiah xxv. 4.</P>
<P N="7">7. The honor of Je&s;us Chri&s;t's &s;aviour&s;hip in part depends on the reallity of eternal puni&s;hment. For &s;alvation always re&s;pects the evil from which, as well as the good to which it is affected. Con&s;equently as much as is taken from the eternity of future puni&s;hment, ju&s;t &s;o much is taken from the glory of &s;alvation by Je&s;us Chri&s;t. For only by him are a|ny &s;aved from the wrath to come. I. The&s;&s;. i. 10.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="40" REF="017812_0040_0FA31B2FC3A0E4E0">8 Future puni&s;hment is the foil to &s;et of off di&s;tingui&s;hing grace to tho&s;e who are &s;aved; gives rea&s;on for, and ani|mates the &s;ongs of &s;uch, in prai&s;e of God and the Lamb; and it will be as nece&s;&s;ary in all future periods of eternity, as it was at fir&s;t.</P>
<P N="9">9. It is the truth and certainty of eternal puni&s;hment, which emphatically gives character to God, as a righteous judge; and gives weight, to and &s;upports his revealed judg|ment, about the nature and difference of &s;in and holine&s;s. Con&s;equently,</P>
<P N="10">10. As it will be equally nece&s;&s;ary, that all the&s;e purpo&s;es &s;hould be &s;erved in all periods of eternity, as at any of them; &s;o the &s;ame rea&s;on which ju&s;tifies damnation at all, will equal|ly prove the nece&s;&s;ity of its eternity.</P>
<P N="11">11. And as each, and every one of the&s;e purpo&s;es &s;erved by eternal future puni&s;hment, is a good of infinite value; &s;o it is evident that future eternal puni&s;hment is an infinite good; in the intelligent &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P N="12">12. Nay more, for as innumerable infinite goods, mu&s;t be of more worth and value than all the lo&s;es &s;u&s;tained by a finite number of finite creatures, in that future puni&s;hment; &s;o that future puni&s;hment, mu&s;t on the whole, be a pure, and ab&s;tract good, a mo&s;t rational and worthy object of joy and prai&s;e, for the intelligent &s;y&s;tem, and &s;o we are arrived exactly at the di|vine te&s;timony. Rev. xvi. 5. "thou art righteous O Lord, who art and wa&s;t and &s;hall be becau&s;e thou ha&s;t judged thus". And now we may under&s;tand the cxxxvi P&s;alm, 10.14.17.18.19.20. as a &s;ong of prai&s;e for penal execution, and each a&s;cribed to mercy, and that as a rea&s;on which endures forever, to which therefore all mu&s;t concur who love mercy. And therefore re&s;pecting &s;uch as do not &s;o concur, God will be ju&s;tified when he &s;peaks, and clear when he judgeth, P&s;alm, lvii, 4.</P>
<P N="12">XII. The twelfth &s;entiment evidential of eternal puni&s;h|ment is, it is probable the damned would rather chu&s;e, on their own principles, continuance in their &s;tate, than the company and employments of the beatific vi&s;ion, if they had opportunity of free choice. This in &s;ome mea&s;ure appears,</P>
<P N="1">1 Becau&s;e the devil, who loves ea&s;e, honor and happine&s;s, as well as any; when he had opportunity of free conver&s;ation with his judge, as in the ca&s;e of Job. Job, i. 6. &amp;c. And al&s;o in the affair of Ahab, I. Kings, xxii. 21.22. And of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, whom &s;atan knew to be his &s;overeign. Mat. iv. 3. &amp;c.
<PB N="41" REF="017812_0041_0FA31B3086D28560">
He never moved one word, for a rever&s;ion of the decree of his puni&s;hment.</P>
<P N="2">2. The natural aver&s;ion of &s;inful men to all holy objects, which in the Bible is called enmity; is &s;uch, as doubtle&s;s render the &s;tate of the damned, more con&s;onant to the feel|ings, of tho&s;e who are in it; than the immediate glory of God, and the holy world would be death and damnation, make no moral alterations in the &s;ubjects; and the &s;ame di&s;po|&s;ition of heart; which makes aver&s;ion to all holy objects here, no doubt operates according to its nature there.</P>
<P N="3">3. When Dives, one of the damned, had opportunity of free conver&s;ation with Abraham, a fellow man; he offered not one word, for a place in Abraham's bo&s;om: he only wanted &s;ome mitigation of mi&s;ery, in his own &s;ituation.</P>
<P>But as the device of &s;alvation for all men, excludes the noted doctrine of election; it is nece&s;&s;ary a te&s;timony &s;hould here be given to the truth of this doctrine of God. There|fore,</P>
<P N="13">XIII. If God has cho&s;en a number of per&s;ons out of the body of mankind, to be &s;aved, then all mankind will not be &s;aved: But God has cho&s;en a number out of mankind to be &s;aved; therefore all men will not be &s;aved.</P>
<P>Election is thus de&s;cribed, <HI>ex omnibus Electio ad &s;alutem,</HI> i. e. a choo&s;ing &s;ome out of all, to &s;alvation. So Peter writing to the believing &s;trangers, I. Pet. i. 2. &s;ays "they were elect, ac|cording to the foreknowledge of God". And Paul &s;aith, Rom. xi. 5. "there was a remnant in his time, an&s;werable to Elijah's &s;even thou&s;and, according to the election of grace", and he &s;aith of the The&s;&s;alonian church, "God hath from the beginning cho&s;en you to &s;alvation," Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;aith of his followers, "I have cho&s;en you out of the world." There|fore Rom. xi. 5. he &s;aith, "the election hath obtained it, and the re&s;t were blinded," but "as many as were ordained to eternal life believed." Acts xiii. 48. but though it is a pro|&s;titution of &s;uch evidence, to urge it on &s;uch as are not influ|enced by &s;criptural authority; yet for the &s;ake of &s;uch as re|verence the judgment of God, a few more evidences may be given to this e&s;&s;ential article in the divine &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P N="1">1. If the &s;criptures are the infallible word of God, and do affirm the doctrine of election, in the &s;en&s;e above ex|plained, then this doctrine mu&s;t be believed at infinite peril&punc; But that the &s;criptures <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e the word of God, is generally con|fe&s;&s;ed, and that they do affirm this doctrine, of God's choo&s;ing
<PB N="42" REF="017812_0042_0FA31B3143179C58">
&s;ome of mankind to &s;alvation, and that therefore all men cannot be &s;aved, has already been proved, and &s;hall be made further evident; therefore this doctrine mu&s;t be believed, at the peril of giving the lie to God and the Bible, and that in a multitude of in&s;tances. So at the period of this world, when tho&s;e who are heirs of glory, are to be received to that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, the account of it, which is perfectly right, &s;aith, Mat. xxiv. 31. "He &s;hall &s;end his angels, and they &s;hall gather together his elect, from the four winds." And of the&s;e God has declared, I. The&s;&s;. v ix. "That he has not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain &s;alvation by our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t." And there are about a &s;core of in&s;tances in the Bible wherein &s;ome form of the word ELECT is u&s;ed to the &s;ame purpo&s;e; and con&s;equently &s;o many evidences, quite incon|te&s;tible again&s;t the device of Salvation for all men. And twice that number of texts, wherein &s;ome form of the word CHOSEN is u&s;ed to the &s;ame purpo&s;e; each determining the truth and right of the doctrine of election in the above &s;en&s;e. Be&s;ides a number of in&s;tances, wherein the word AP|POINT in &s;ome of its forms, is u&s;ed, as indicative of the &s;o|vereignty, and to the &s;ame purpo&s;e. Al&s;o a number of texts might be named, wherein the word <HI>ordained</HI> is u&s;ed to the &s;ame purpo&s;e. As Acts xiii. 48. forenamed, "as many as were ordained to eternal life believed." And about fifty pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, indicate the &s;ame &s;overeignty, and to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, by the expre&s;&s;ion <HI>I will</HI> and the like, as to the di&s;play of di&s;tingui&s;hing grace among men, re&s;pect|ing final &s;alvation. As Exod. xxxiii. 19. "I will be gra|cious to whom I will be gracious; and I will &s;hew mercy, on whom I will &s;hew mercy." So I&s;aiah lviii. 8. "With everla&s;ting kindne&s;s will I have mercy on thee, &s;aith the Lord thy redeemer." And Rom. ix. 16. "It is not of him who willeth, nor of him who runeth, but of God who &s;hew|eth mercy."</P>
<P>But becau&s;e a number of objections, again&s;t this hated di&s;|play of the divine nature, &s;eem plau&s;ible to the incon&s;i|derate. A very brief hint of reply may be given to &s;ome of them.</P>
<P>Obj. 1. But this does not agree with that love which God has for men in common.</P>
<P>An&s;. No &s;cripture implies that God has <HI>&s;aving Love</HI> for mankind in common. Many &s;criptures which are perverted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t that dictate of pride have been proved already
<PB N="43" REF="017812_0043_0FA31B3202CE98F0">
to have no &s;uch import. But God, as the God of all na|ture, doth &s;o love men in common, as to &s;end his own &s;on in their nature, to &s;et an example for them all; and to make actual and perfect atonement, for &s;uch of them, as it plea&s;|ed God to give him, in the covenant of redemption. He doth &s;o love them in common, as to give them being, life, breath, and all the mercies they enjoy. "He maketh his &s;un to ri&s;e on the evil and on the good; and &s;endeth rain on the ju&s;t, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the unju&s;t. And &s;o his tender mercies are on them all.</P>
<P>Obj. 2. This makes God a re&s;pector of per&s;ons, which is contrary to Acts x. 34.</P>
<P>An&s;. No per&s;onal con&s;ideration at all, commends any per|&s;on to the grace of God; he neither loves or hates any, becau&s;e they are black or white, Jew or Greek, rich or poor, or for any thing el&s;e merely per&s;onal. "Not for your &s;akes, do I this, &s;aith the Lord God, be it known to you." Ezek. xxxvi. 32. Saving grace is all for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, not for ours.</P>
<P>Obj. 3. Then there is need of good works.</P>
<P>An&s;. And art thou one of tho&s;e who expect to be &s;aved by good works? No works of ours are the means, or rea|&s;ons of election, or con&s;equent &s;alvation. Tho&s;e who are &s;aved are elected to do good works, as much as to &s;alva|tion, and as an evidence of their title to it, and qualifi|cation for it. "They are cho&s;en to &s;alvation through &s;anc|tification of the &s;pirit, and belief of the truth." II. The&s;&s;. ii. 13.</P>
<P>Obj. 4. But the threatnings of the law are made in com|mon to all.</P>
<P>An&s;. They be &s;o, as a mean to make them &s;ee their dan|ger, and need of a &s;aviour, and "they that hear &s;hall live." John v. 25. This is a mean e&s;tabli&s;hed to bring about the end and de&s;ign of election.</P>
<P>Obj. 5. Then God made multitudes on purpo&s;e to damn them.</P>
<P>An&s;. It is not true. The fir&s;t object of de&s;ign with God, in all his works is, "to make his name known in all the earth." Rom. ix. 16. i. e. to &s;hew to all, who he is, and what he can do. That he may be feared, obeyed, and tru&s;ted. Indeed he always knew who would regard him, and who not<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and it always was his decree, "the &s;oul that &s;ins &s;hall d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e." Ezek. x<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Wickedne&s;s cho&s;en, and
<PB N="44" REF="017812_0044_0FA31B3326D3E160">
held fa&s;t is a certain mean of de&s;truction. "The ways of &s;in are death." Rom. vi. 23. But damnation of men never was the leading object of de&s;ign with God. He cannot have ta&s;te for that object in it&s;elf. Yet he delights to glorify his ju&s;tice, on tho&s;e who have abu&s;ed his mea&s;ure. "Je|&s;us knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who &s;hould betray him." John vi. 64.</P>
<P>Obj. 6. But the doctrine of election tends to relax the bonds of morality.</P>
<P>An&s;. All men are bound to holine&s;s, both in principle and practice; and the&s;e bonds cannot be relaxed, but by choice of their &s;ubject. And what &s;uch &s;ubject knows not can give no ju&s;t cau&s;e to &s;uch choice; but no man knows the object of election; till he finds Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the object of his own election. And that his own principle prevents remi&s;&s;|ne&s;s to holine&s;s.</P>
<P>Obj. 7. But ab&s;olute election renders means of grace u&s;e|le&s;s.</P>
<P>An&s;. If by means of grace is meant any thing in this world &s;ufficient of it&s;elf to give grace; it is as wide from the Bi|ble, as the denial of election. But if the objection de&s;igns means appointed and u&s;ed by God to beget grace; it is mo&s;t injudicious. How &s;hould God's chu&s;ing &s;ome to &s;alvation, hinder his be&s;towing grace on them? No man ever was cho&s;|en immediately to &s;alvation; election is immediately to the priviledge of divine in&s;titutions; and &s;o to the ble&s;&s;ing of God attending them, and &s;o to &s;alvation following there|upon. II. The&s;&s;. ii. 13. "God hath cho&s;en you to &s;alva|tion&punc; through &s;anctification of the &s;pirit, and belief of the truth."</P>
<P N="2">2. If the doctrine of election is nece&s;&s;ary to the honour of all divine perfections, then it ought to have a place a|mong eternal truths, but the former is true, therefore the letter mu&s;t be allowed. A few things mu&s;t be premi&s;ed to clear the truth of this hypothe&s;is.</P>
<P N="1">1. That Je&s;us Chri&s;t was de&s;igned from eternity to the office of redeemer of &s;inners, this will be allowed, and this is the rea&s;on why he is called "the Lamb &s;lain from the foundation of the word." Rev. xiii. 8. To this end was he "foreordained, before the foundation of the world." I. Peter i. 20.</P>
<P N="2">2. That the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e of redemption intentionally paid by him then, was infinitely great and valuable. This al&s;o will be allowed.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="45" REF="017812_0045_0FA31B339ED708E8">3. That the moving rea&s;on of all this was THE WILL OF GOD. Therefore &s;aid P&s;alm xl. 7, 8. "Lo I come, I de|light to do thy will, O my God." And John x. 18. I lay down my life, this commandment have I received of my Father.</P>
<P N="4">4. Then it became nece&s;&s;ary for the honor of all divine perfections, that his reward &s;hould be a&s;&s;igned him, by the &s;ame &s;overeign will, and made infallibly &s;ecure, that he might know certainly what he &s;hould have, for the travail of his &s;oul.</P>
<P N="1">1. The honor of divine ju&s;tice became intere&s;ted, in Chri&s;t's having a reward a&s;&s;igned him, and this made infallibly cer|tain. For it is a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ule of natural righteou&s;ne&s;s, "the labourer is worthy of his hire," Luke x. 7. but how this co&s;tly attone|ment &s;hould &s;ucceed, or whether it &s;hould certainly &s;ucceed at all, could not be made quite certain to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, but by an ab&s;olute determination or decree, wherein God pledgeth him|&s;elf to the redeemer, to cau&s;e to be effectuated &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s and reward infallibly. There is nothing in all exi&s;tence ab&s;o|lutely infallible but God. The rea&s;on of this ca&s;e demanded infallibility of &s;ecurity to Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Therefore Rom. v. viii. 29. &s;peaks in this manner, he did Prede&s;tinate, or ab&s;olutely decree and appoint, tho&s;e whom he foreknew, to be conform|ed to the image of his &s;on; that he, i. e. Chri&s;t, might be quite &s;ure that he &s;hould be the fir&s;t born among many bre|thren. therefore it is &s;aid, in Gal. iii. 17. that the law could not di&s;annul the covenant which was confimed before of God in Chri&s;t, and I&s;aiah de&s;cribes this righteous &s;ettlement thus, I&s;a, liii 10. "when thou &s;halt make his &s;oul an offering for &s;in, he &s;hall &s;ee his &s;eed", and when all this is fulfilled in fact, then ju&s;tice is honored, for God the father has dealt ju&s;tly by his &s;uffering &s;on.</P>
<P>Obj. But we make this reward the greater, and more ho|norable, by excluding election; and allowing the whole hu|mane race to Chri&s;t, in&s;tead of an elect number.</P>
<P>An&s;. That is no honor at all, but an infinite reproach, which advanceth one attribute of God, at the expence, and infinite di&s;honor of another. Righteou&s;ne&s;s and ju&s;tice are attributes of God, immediately di&s;honored by &s;in, and they have a prima|ry demand for reparation of honors; but in the device of &s;al|vation for all men no equal monument of honor, to the&s;e di|vine attributes is allowed at all.</P>
<P>It is indeed &s;aid, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;upplied this defect, by equal honors to tho&s;e divine attributes, but we all know that
<PB N="46" REF="017812_0046_0FA31B3442BBBCD0">
no man knows any thing at all about this affair but what he finds in the Bible, we al&s;o equally know not only that the Bible &s;ays no &s;uch thing, but affirms, and uniformly maintains the rever&s;e, viz. that Je&s;us Chri&s;t did not make his &s;oul an of|fering for all &s;inners, as has been proved, but for tho&s;e only whom God had cho&s;en, or elected in Chri&s;t, according to Eph. i. 4. therefore Rev. xiv. 4. &s;aith, "the&s;e are they which follow the Lamb; the&s;e were redeemed from among men," con&s;equently no attonement was actually made &s;o the re&s;t of mankind; therefore u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ppea&s;ed wrath impends him &s;till; and eternal puni&s;hment is prepared for them, as has been proved already.</P>
<P>So that the denial of the doctrine of election, implies infi|nite di&s;honor to the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God; which can be &s;olv|ed no way but on the avowed principle of the bible, viz. that Je&s;us Chri&s;t did perfect honor to inju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed ju&s;tice, by an equal attonement, for all who were given him, by the father in the covenant of redemption; and the &s;ame divine attribute is ho|nored, as to all others by infliction of the penalty always &s;uf|fered to the breach of the law.</P>
<P N="2">2. So al&s;o the mercy of God is honored by the doctrine of e|lection. Therefore on the plan of the Bible, which always implies this doctrine, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">xxxv P&s;alm, 10. v. &s;ays, "mer|cy and truth are met together: righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace have ki&s;&s;ed each other." And this in con&s;equence of the &s;alvation wrought out by Chri&s;t, named in the foregoing 9. v. And on the &s;ame account the Apo&s;tle &s;aith, Eph. i. 4.5.6. that God's having prede&s;tinated tho&s;e whom he had cho&s;en, or e|lected in Chri&s;t, to the adoption of children, by Je&s;us Chri&s;t to him&s;elf, according to the good plea&s;ure of his will, is to the prai&s;e of the glory of his grace, and the &s;ame Apo&s;tle teacheth Rom. ix. 23. that "the riches of his glory are made known, on the ve&s;&s;els of mercy afore prepared unto glory." Nay mer|cy is eminently honored by election, two ways.</P>
<P N="1">1. Becau&s;e mercy, love, and goodwill to men, are the &s;ource of it. Therefore the Apo&s;tle a&s;cribes election, which is according to the fore-knowledge of God the father, to the abundance of his mercy, I, Pet. 1.2.3. &s;o it is called electi|on of grace, or mere mercy, Rom. xi. 5.</P>
<P N="2">2. Becau&s;e abounding mercy is the effect and con&s;equence of election, "he hath cho&s;en you to &s;alvation;" and to holi|ne&s;s and faith, as the only way to that &s;alvation. II. The&s;&s;. ii. 13. they who are elected, "have grace and peace multi|plied
<PB N="47" REF="017812_0047_0FA31B3504022F20">
to them," I. Pet. i. 2. election infallibly i&s;&s;ues in "a lively hope, of the inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away, re&s;erved in heaven for them," I. Pet. i. 4. and they are &s;urely "kept by the power of God, through &s;aith to that &s;alvation," 5. v. but for men to a&s;cibe to mer|cy, the &s;alvation of all men, without any warrant from God, is &s;uch a di&s;honor to the mercy of God, as weakens the &s;criptural te&s;timony about it; and de&s;troys the ground and rea&s;on of chri&s;tian confidence in it; becau&s;e of cour&s;e, the Bi|ble is not to be depended on about it. The like might be al|ledged of every other attribute of God.</P>
<P>So it appears that it was nece&s;&s;ary there &s;hould be an election of &s;ome to eternal life, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t might have infallible a&s;&s;urance of &s;eeing the travail of his &s;oul, and of being &s;atisfied, that as many as were given him, in that inflexible decree, &s;hould certainly be with him, to behold his glory, and &s;hout his prai&s;e forever and ever. And it was nece&s;&s;ary as an infallible ground of a&s;&s;urance and certainty, that every attribute of God, &s;hould be &s;een and held, honorable and glorious forever. For nothing at all, in a &s;cheme of favor to &s;inners, can be an infallible ground of certainty, but a decree of God. Nor any thing make the import of &s;uch decree publickly <HI>certain,</HI> but proper a&s;|&s;urance that it derives from the inflexible, and rightfully &s;overeign WILL OF GOD: having in view the glory of all his attributes, and the infallible di&s;play of infinite mercy in the &s;alvation of &s;ome &s;inners; which indeed, as the ca&s;e is, is a number pa&s;t all numbering, "which no man can num|ber. Rev. vii. 9.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. If the doctrine of &s;alvation for all men, and &s;o of cour&s;e, the exclu&s;ion of the divine doctrine of gracious e|lection, imports a &s;uppo&s;ition of the natural &s;ufficiency of the will of man, to any good work; then that doctrine of &s;alvation for all men, with its con&s;equent implications, is to be avoided, with mo&s;t &s;erious dete&s;tation. Some rea&s;on for this conclu&s;ion &s;hall be given.</P>
<P N="1">1. The doctrine of &s;alvation for all men, implying as is a|bove &s;uppo&s;ed, is certainly incon&s;i&s;tent with the evidences of the mind and will of God, above-cited; and with innume|rable others; a &s;pecimen of which now follows, II. John, ix. 10.11. "who&s;oever tran&s;gre&s;&s;eth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Chri&s;t, hath not God: he that abideth in the doc|trine of Chri&s;t, hath both the Father and the Son. If there

come any to you and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your hou&s;e; neither bid him God &s;peed, for he that bid|deth him God &s;peed, is partaker of his evil deeds." The ca|pital idea in this pa&s;&s;age of &s;cripture, is in the word "tran&s;|gre&s;&s;eth." Some evidence of its &s;en&s;e and pertinency in this ca&s;e, mu&s;t be added.</P>
<P N="1">1.

<P N="2">2.

<P N="3">3. The above mentioned word rendered "tran&s;gre&s;&s;eth," is u&s;ed Mat. xv. 3. to &s;ignify making void, or &s;etting a&s;ide, the doctrine, or commandments of God, by mere devices of men, &s;uch therefore as do &s;o, we are warned again&s;t in this text,</P>
<P N="4">4. The margin of the Bible refers the reader to I. Cor. v. 11. as of a parrellel nature and importance, but there the coun&s;el &s;ubjoined is; "with &s;uch an one no not to eat." It al&s;o re|fers to I. Cor. xvi. 22. which is, "if any man love not the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t;" of which his principles and practice mu&s;t be evidence, "let him be an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">thema maranatha," he al&s;o refers to G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. i. 8. "if we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other go&s;pel to you, than that we have preached to you, let him be accur&s;ed," and to &s;hew how much God him&s;elf in&s;i&s;ted on keeping the entire &s;y&s;tem of the go&s;pel uncorrupted: it is re|peated again in the next ver&s;e, "let him be accur&s;ed."</P>
<P>Indeed the author of the Bible, &s;o well knew its perfection as a &s;y&s;tem: and the mo&s;t important nece&s;&s;ity, of it, being pre|&s;erved pure, and con&s;idered as a perfect te&s;t of Right; both in things to be believed, and in things to be done; that though he approved the Church of <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rgamos,</HI> in mo&s;t points, yet he charged them, with having among them &s;uch as held the doc|trine of <HI>Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> the crime of which was, ca&s;ting a &s;tumbling block before the children of I&s;rael.

which admoni&s;heth all people, as they fear God, and would be conformed to his perfect &s;y&s;tem, and &s;o be acceptable to him; that they avoid and oppo&s;e a &s;ett of notions, &s;o palpably in|con&s;i&s;tent with the whole Bible as this of &s;alvation for all men, with its appendages, have been proved to be.</P>
<P N="2">2. The doctrine of &s;alvation for all men is an open affront to the letter, as well as evident meaning of plain &s;cripture. The Bible a&s;&s;ures us, that God of his abounding grace, de&s;igned &s;ome, yea, many of the fallen race of men to &s;alvation, by Je|&s;us Chri&s;t, and gave them to him for that purpo&s;e, and the&s;e are they for whom he made &s;atisfaction; which is the plain &s;en&s;e of the following expre&s;&s;ions of the mind of God. viz. John xvii. 6. &amp;c. "I have manife&s;ted thy name to the men whom thou gave&s;t me out of the world, thine they were and thou ga|ve&s;t them me, I pray for them, I pray not for the world, but for them which thou ha&s;t given me. They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. For their &s;akes I &s;anctify my|&s;elf; that they al&s;o may be &s;anctified through the truth." John xviii. 9. "Of them which thou gave&s;t me, I have lo&s;t none." John i. 12. "To as many as received him, to them gave he power to be &s;ons of God." John iii. 16. "That who|&s;oever believeth in him &s;hould not peri&s;h." John x. 29. "My Father who gave them me, is greater than all." John vi. 39. "And his will is, that of all which he hath given me, I &s;hould lo&s;e nothing." The apo&s;tle's object was "to &s;ave &s;ome." "All men have not faith." II. The&s;&s;. iii. 3. The flock of God is "a little flock." Yet it is "the plea&s;ure of God to give them the kingdom." Luke xii. 32. Only they who have part in the fir&s;t re&s;urrection, are written in the Lamb's book of life. Rev. xiii. 8.20.6. Only tho&s;e "whom he fore-knew did he prede&s;tinate to be conformed to the image of his &s;on." Rom. viii. 29. Spiritual ble&s;&s;ings are peculiar to &s;uch as are cho&s;en in Chri&s;t; they only being prede&s;tinated to the adoption of children. Eph. i. 3.4.5. The&s;e are the elected, or cho&s;en generation; the purcha&s;ed people I. Pet. ii. 9. 'In no wi&s;e &s;hall any enter into the kingdom of heaven, but they who are written in the Lamb's book of life." Rev. xxi. 27.</P>
<P N="3">3. The doctrine of &s;alvation for all men, tends to deceive multitudes with hopes of &s;alvation, to whom God has given no hopes of it. For only &s;uch as believe and are conformed
<PB N="50" REF="017812_0050_0FA31B3742B93078">
to the Bible, can have &s;alvation. Mark xvi. 16. "To every &s;oul of them who obey unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;hall be rendered in|dignation and wrath." Rom. ii. 8, 9. "The wicked &s;hall be turned into hell, with all the nations who forget God. P&s;al. ix. 17. Be not deceived, the unrighteous &s;hall not in|herit the kingdom of God. I. Cor. vi. 9. And the holy book abounds with &s;uch &s;entences. To all which, the device of &s;al|vation for all men, is a mo&s;t daring; oppo&s;ition; and the faire&s;t way to &s;upport a pretence of this device, is to deny the divini|ty of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and the Bible. And after Dei&s;m, the road is open to Athei&s;m, and either of the&s;e will decide the point, who &s;hall be &s;aved and who not. But 'tis affecting to con&s;ider multitudes, without any qualifications for future happine&s;s, pacifying their con&s;ciences with this, that &s;ome men, and perhaps, becau&s;e of advantage, they call them great and good, affirm that Chri&s;t died for all, and of co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that all &s;hall be &s;aved. So becau&s;e this better plea&s;eth a &s;lothful wick|ed heart, they turn a deaf ear to the bible, and to all who urge its contents, for they cannot hold both to be true, &s;ince they are directly oppo&s;ite to each other. And as God will not be&s;tow &s;alvation in a way di&s;honorable to Je&s;us Chri&s;t and the Bible, &s;o all &s;uch mu&s;t peri&s;h.</P>
<P>Hoping what has been offered on the foregoing topics, may excite &s;ome hand more at lei&s;ure, and better furni&s;hed to do them ju&s;tice; a few corollaries will conclude the whole.</P>
<P N="1">1. The doctrine of election has divine authority, i. e. ab&s;o|lute a&s;&s;urance was given to the redeemer, for whom, and how many, he &s;hould make &s;atisfaction to divine ju&s;tice, which number of mankind being as has been &s;hewn quite numberle&s;s; is in the &s;cripture called the Lord's inheritance; his people, his portion, heritage &amp;c. which being cho&s;en for his part, he will never leave nor for&s;ake. Heb. xiii. 5. to the&s;e the king|dom of heaven is &s;ecured by covenant. Heb. ix. 15. and it mu&s;t be high arrogance to a&s;&s;ign to that kingdom any among men, not quallified according to charter, and who cannot be named in the LAMB's book of life.</P>
<P N="2">2. Then the great God is ab&s;olute &s;overeign; and it is law|ful for him to do what he will with his own. Mat. xx. 15, all mankind were his &s;ole property: and he dealt bountifully with them. They have gone a&s;tray, and wa&s;ted his goods; though
<PB N="51" REF="017812_0051_0FA31B3805265C00">
he had given them a &s;ummary of his law, by which they knew, the demerit of &s;in was death in all &s;en&s;es. Now all their goods are forfeited; and they have no claim, but execution of penalty. Yet this was the time of love, he pa&s;&s;ed by, and &s;aid to his Jeru&s;alem, as a type of his elect, LIVE. Ezek. xvi. 6. and when he &s;aw there was none to &s;ave them, his own arm brought &s;alvation, he &s;aid, "I will redeem them from death." Ho&s;. xiii. 14. and as the &s;ource of this hope, was the mere benevolence of God, &s;o when he had glorified him&s;elf in &s;uch a purpo&s;e; he held him&s;elf obliged to glorify him&s;elf again in an an&s;werable accompli&s;hment. John xii. 28.</P>
<P N="3">3. To what purpo&s;e then can it be, to palm on him, a more exten&s;ive inheritance, among men, than he who is Lord of all, cho&s;e for that purpo&s;e? E&s;pecially as no manner of title can be given, for want of authority. Will he thank them for it? &s;urely no. Will he not rather reprove them, and &s;et the&s;e things in dreadful order before their eyes? P&s;alm l. 21.22.</P>
<P N="4">4. Then perfect righteou&s;ne&s;s may be affirmed of every word, and every work of God. "He is a rock, his work is perfect, all his ways are judgment, a God of truth, and without ini|quity ju&s;t and right is he." Deut. xxxii. 4. Therefore he cur&s;|eth them who pervert judgment. Deut. xxvii. 19. And will &s;urely reprove them who deal deceitfully for him. Job xiii. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.</P>
<P N="5">5. Then it certainly becomes us, to regulate our &s;enti|ments and conduct, exactly according to the determinations of his mo&s;t perfect &s;y&s;tem; for every deviation from it, will receive a ju&s;t recompen&s;e of reward. Heb. ii. 2. Be&s;ides, by this word &s;hall we all be judged at the la&s;t day. For when the three books, which are the publick regi&s;ters of the kingdom, &s;hall be opened, of which the Bible is one; while omni&s;cience and con&s;cience, are the other two; all men will be judged out of the things written in the&s;e books; ju&s;t as they have treated them. Rev. xx. 12. So it is the highe&s;t intere&s;t, as well as duty, of all men to govern them|&s;elves entirely, by the mo&s;t legible of the&s;e books; the Bi|ble. For "it is a quick di&s;cerner of the thoughts, and in|tents of the heart." Heb. iv. 12.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="52" REF="017812_0052_0FA31B38C2B88C68">6. By attention to the Bible we gain the rea&s;ons, which in|fluenced the divine mind, in concerting his plan, e&s;pecially as to his chu&s;ing &s;ome of mankind, and not all to &s;alvation, viz.</P>
<P N="1">1. That he might thereby e&s;tabli&s;h a witne&s;&s;ing monument, of the righteous &s;overeignty, of which he knew him&s;elf well po&s;&s;e&s;t; and which he knew it was be&s;t for men to know and revere. For he knew all men were his ab&s;olute property; and that they were all bankrupts; having totally forfeited all good, and lo&s;t all ground of claim to a re&s;toration. He knew al&s;o that his ju&s;tice was as honorable as his mercy; yea that both were alike honorable. And though he was under no bonds to &s;hew mercy at all; yet &s;uch is his benevolent nature, that mercy plea&s;ed him. But &s;ome of men, were due to his ju|&s;tice, as a monument of its righteou&s;ne&s;s. And the judge of all the earth mu&s;t do right. Some ancient evidences of his righteous &s;overeignty, are not to be di&s;puted. He defeated the councel of "AHITH<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">PHEL, to the intent that he might bring e|vel upon ABSALOM." II. Sam. xvii. 14. And did in fact give order in &s;uch manner, as &s;hould i&s;&s;ue in the final blindne&s;s of many. I&s;aiah vi. 9, 10. To this end he &s;ent &s;trong delu&s;ions to &s;ome, that they might be damned. II. The&s;&s;. ii. 11, 12. So his righteou&s;ne&s;s appears, in making the wicked for the day of evil. Prov. xvi. 4. And di&s;obedient ones were appointed to &s;tumble at the word. I Pet. ii. 8. And &s;ome as natural brute bea&s;ts made to be de&s;troyed, &s;hall utterly peri&s;h. II. Pet. ii. 12.</P>
<P N="2">2. That he might make his grace appear as &s;elf-&s;ufficient, in making &s;alvation infallible &s;ure to &s;ome, who de&s;erved it no more than tho&s;e who were before ordained to damnation. Jud. iv. And to bind them, by the &s;tronge&s;t bonds to honor his laws, and prai&s;e his grace forever. And they will forever "&s;ing unto the Lord, becau&s;e he hath done marvelous things." P&s;alm xcviii. 1.</P>
<P N="3">3. That he might furni&s;h the <HI>Lapis lydius,</HI> or effectual touch-&s;tone; by which to try the &s;pirits of mankind. Men often &s;ay, "I go &s;ir." But when they find the evident drift of the Bible, is to exalt the Lord alone, and to humble the pride of all fle&s;h; then they turn back, and walk no more with it. They &s;ay the&s;e are hard &s;ayings; and they are offended. For "they are
<PB N="53" REF="017812_0053_0FA31B3984661D28">
lovers of their own &s;elves." II. Tim. iii. 2. And cannot en|dure what God has given for &s;ound doctrine. II. Tim. iv. 3. And &s;ometimes they "&s;hoot their arrows, even bitter words" again&s;t chri&s;tianity and turn Dei&s;ts. And &s;o make their fol|ly manife&s;t to all men. II. Tim. iii. 9. But God "will ren|der to every man according to his deeds." Rom. ii. 6.</P>
<P N="7">7. Then to hold the &s;alvation of all men, is no evidence of love either to God or man. It is no evidence of love to God, for love to God, always coincides with his written word. Therefore Chri&s;t &s;ays, "If ye love me, keep my command|ments." John xiv. 15. And "if any man love me, he will keep my words." John xiv. 23. Whereas the notion of &s;al|vation for all men, is not only no part of the word of God; but mo&s;t palpably incon&s;i&s;tent with it, as has been proved.</P>
<P>Nor doth this notion indicate love to man. For love to man never flatters them in &s;in, never leads into &s;nares in|dulgently; nor leaves them in evident danger. All which is true of encouragements of &s;alvation to any, in a way di|rectly contrary to the word of God. For the con&s;tant man|ner of the word of God, is to urge faith and holine&s;s, as the only &s;upport of a hope of &s;alvation, and to denounce dam|nation to all de&s;titute of the&s;e qualifications. Love &s;eeks the good, not the harm of its object. Faith and holine&s;s are the honor, as well as happine&s;s of their &s;ubject. The&s;e therefore are the fir&s;t de&s;ign of the Bible; and it gives a&s;|&s;urance to the &s;ubjects of them be they otherwi&s;e who, and what they may; that they &s;hall be happy forever. And there is no hope to any other; for "the wicked &s;hall be turned into hell, with all the nations that forget God." P&s;alm ix. 17.</P>
<P N="8">8. Then it is the part of inhuman cruelty to flatter men with the hopes of heaven, in a way utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with the determined coun&s;el of the God of heaven. And &s;o in a way which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily terminate in eternal mi&s;ery; from he nature of the ca&s;e, as well as from the word of God. For &s;in and guilt are the natural con&s;tituents of mi&s;ery. "Deceive not with thy lips," is an expre&s;s law of God. Prov. xxiv. 28. There is a word of doctrine by the &s;light and craftine&s;s of men, whereby they lie in wait to deceive. Eph. iv. 14. There can be no peace to &s;uch as take mea&s;ures to de&s;troy men. What peace had ZIMRI who &s;lew his ma&s;ter?</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="017812_0054_0FA31B3A42B78A98">The author therefore begs the liberty of a few words in friendly freedom with the&s;e men, who &s;upport the doctrine of &s;alvation for all men.</P>
<P>Dear Sirs, You allow the Bible is the word of God; you make u&s;e of it as &s;uch; you allow its authority is well e&s;tabli&s;hed. How can you fall to &s;ee the importance of its analogy, i. e. the con&s;i&s;tency of one part with another? God is one; and his &s;y&s;tem is like him&s;elf. It is like the coat which Chri&s;t wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, without &s;eam, woven throughout. You mu&s;t have &s;ome difficulty to reconcile your views, with many parts of the &s;cripture. How much &s;afer would it be for you to &s;u&s;pect a &s;cheme of &s;entiments, of which you mu&s;t have the trouble of doubting whether it will be owned, or not, in the burning day? Than to run a pre&s;umptious ven|ture, of the final di&s;plea&s;ure of your judge, for perverting his word, and for teaching men &s;o. It is mo&s;t certain that they who love his word in its mo&s;t manife&s;tly con&s;i&s;tent &s;en&s;e, mu&s;t have peace, the peace of God which pa&s;&s;eth un|der&s;tanding. Their con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s mu&s;t happify them. But pre&s;umers in divine matters, cannot have the witne&s;s with|in them, that in uprightne&s;s and godly &s;incerity, they hold their religious conver&s;ation. It will not do, to run ri&s;ques in matters of eternity. When our hearts are &s;ound in God's &s;tatutes, they will feel ble&s;&s;edne&s;s. And God will love them who unfeignedly love his holy laws. God has cer|tainly communicated his mind to us in the &s;criptures as he thought be&s;t. Why are you not willing he &s;hould judge for you in that matter: Since you allow the divinity of the &s;y&s;tem? Our Saviour &s;ays, "if it were not &s;o, I would have told you." John xiv. 2. His kindne&s;s and wi&s;dom certain|ly concerted the whole &s;cheme of the Bible. Can you &s;up|po&s;e on &s;erious con&s;ideration, that if he really intended the &s;alvation of all men; he would not have told us &s;o, plain|ly enough? What could be his motive to conceal that mat|ter; when doubtle&s;s, if it was his mind, he could have made it quite indi&s;putable? He was certainly at liberty to &s;ay what he plea&s;ed about it. Why did he not &s;ay it, and &s;ay it always: that &s;o important a matter, might be out of all doubt? But you &s;ee he has not. Was he uncertain about the mind of God, in that affair, him&s;elf? Surely not. Why
<PB N="55" REF="017812_0055_0FA31B3B04651B58">
did he not &s;peak out then? And not leave us &s;o embarra&s;|&s;ed. Whereas he has given us one conci&s;e emphatical coun&s;el; which if duly attended to, would relieve us en|tirely, viz. John v. 39. "Search the &s;criptures they are they which te&s;tify of me." The word rendered <HI>&s;earch</HI> is <HI>ereunate</HI>; its theme is rendered by <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or</HI>; plea&s;e to admit a few words from the noted Mr. PERKINS on the import of this word. Leigh's Crit. Sac. in Verb. He &s;ays, "the word is Meta|phorical, taken from &s;uch as &s;earch in mines, for &s;ilver and gold. They will dig deep, they will break the &s;everal clods of earth to pieces, to find the golden o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e. Thus mu&s;t we deal with the &s;cripture. Search as we would for gold, or &s;ome precious thing, which we would fain find." Prov. ii. 4. "Search. i. e. &s;hake and lift them, as the word &s;igni|fies. Search narrowly, till the true force and meaning, of every &s;entence; yea of every word and &s;yllable, nay of e|very letter and iota therein, is known and under&s;tood; com|pare place with place, the &s;cope of one place, with the &s;cope of another. Things going before, with what comes after, yea compare word with word, letter with letter; and &s;o &s;earch it throughly." Thus he. And is not divine coun|&s;el worth this pain? Is not our own information, peace, and eternal intere&s;t worth it? Would not all this labour be well repaid, if by that mean, we got evidence of the mind of God? Well, he has &s;aid "then &s;hall we know, when we follow on to know the Lord." Ho&s;. vi. 3. And doubtle&s;s giving good heed to the&s;e coun&s;els, would prevent much darkne&s;s and trouble; and &s;ecure us from many dangerous &s;entiments and practices. Be&s;ides, you are &s;en&s;ible, my friends; that you are &s;omewhat unhappy, not only by the di&s;&s;ention of many from you; but for want of &s;ome more clear and convincing &s;cripture light, in your favor. And becau&s;e you are &s;en&s;ible there is &s;ome appearance of evi|dence again&s;t you in the Bible. Now what if through im|perfection, or &s;omething; for you know you are not infal|lible: it &s;hould appear at the la&s;t day, that you was utter|ly mi&s;taken; for God will have his own way, for all you, or me? And it is certainly rea&s;onable to call it in que&s;tion. If &s;o, he will probably &s;ay, &s;omething like this; I told you, on the whole plainly enough; my people in generations be|fore you, under&s;tood it well. But you precipitately made

And now &s;ee the crouds yonder, who were made &s;ecure in &s;in by your doctrine; plea&s;ing them&s;elves that all would be &s;aved, and &s;o they were &s;afe.
