<HEAD>MEMOIRS OF THE LATE <HI>Rev. Mr. JAMES HERVEY,</HI> M. A. RECTOR OF WESTON-FAVELL, IN NORTH-AM<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">TONSHIRE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Reverend Mr. James Hervey was born on Friday the 26th of Fe|bruary, 1713-14, at Harding&s;tone, a vil|lage about a mile from Northampton; his mother taught him to read, and kept him at home till he was &s;even years old, when he was &s;ent as a day &s;cholar to the free grammar &s;chool at Northampton; there he continued under the tuition of a Mr. Clarke, ma&s;ter of the &s;chool, and vicar of St. Se|pulchre's in that pari&s;h, till he was &s;even|teen, learning the Latin and Greek languag|es, in which he would have made a much earlier progre&s;s, had he not been kept back by his ma&s;ter, who (out of a blind pater|nal
<PB N="14" REF="030558_0011_0FE7CA3D0E23BC58">affection and partiality) would &s;uffer none of his &s;cholars to learn fa&s;ter than his own &s;on.</P>
<P>In the year 1731 he was &s;ent by his fa|ther to the univer&s;ity of Oxford, and enter|od a Fellow of Lincoln College, where he re&s;ided &s;even years, and took his degree of Batchelor of Arts <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Hervey took his degree of Ma&s;ter of arts at Cam|bridge in 1752 and entered at Clarehall.</NOTE>; during his continuance here, he made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Dr. Keil's Anatomy, Dr. Derham's Phy&s;ico and A&s;|tro-Theology, and Spectacle de la Nature, tran&s;lated by Mr. Humphrey's, which la&s;t work he read with peculiar plea&s;ure; nor was he le&s;s delighted with the Rev. Mr. Spence's E&s;&s;ay on Pope's Ody&s;&s;ey, to which he often acknowledged him&s;elf greatly in|debted for his improvement in &s;tile and compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>He entered into holy orders as &s;oon as his age and the cannons of the church would allow, and became curate to his father, who was then po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the living of We&s;ton-Favell and Collingtree, near Northamp|ton; in the year 1738, he went by invita|tion to Stoke Abbey, the &s;eat of his valua|ble friend, Paul Orchard, E&s;q. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This gentleman was the father of Paul Orchard, E&s;q. for whom Mr. Hervey &s;tood &s;pon&s;or, and to whom he dedicated the &s;econd volume of his Meditations.</NOTE> here he
<PB N="15" REF="030558_0012_0FE7CA3E98E31800">continued above two years, greatly e&s;teem|ed and re&s;pected.</P>
<P>In the year 1740 he undertook the cura|cy of Biddeford, fourteen miles from Stoke Abbey; here he had a large congregation, though the income, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of friends, did not exceed &s;ixty pounds a year <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This &s;um, though hardly &s;ufficient to maintain him, he enjoyed with thankfulne&s;s, and was univer&s;ally beloved for hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> piety, humility, and diligent di&s;charge of his duty.</NOTE>; in this place, and very probably about this time, he planned his ingenious meditations; the fir&s;t volume of which was publi&s;hed in February, 1745-6, and the &s;econd in De|cember, 1747, which have been &s;o well re|ceived by the public, that the twenty-fir&s;t edition of them appeared la&s;t year.</P>
<P>About the year 1743 he returned from Biddeford to We&s;ton-Favell, leaving behind him many di&s;con&s;olate friends <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The rector dying, and the new one di&s;mi&s;&s;ing Mr. Her|vey from the curacy (though again&s;t the con&s;ent of all the pa|ri&s;honers, who would have maintained him at their own ex|pence) was the occa&s;ion of his leaving Biddeford.</NOTE>; and conti|nued curate to his &s;ather till June 1750, at which time, being greatly impaired in health occa&s;ioned by his con&s;tant attention to his duty <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">This, if it may be &s;tiled a fault, few, if any of our clergy|men in the pre&s;ent day, can be charged with.</NOTE>, he removed to London to try what
<PB N="16" REF="030558_0013_0FE7CA45247782A0">effect a change of air and relaxation of mind would have upon him: here he &s;taid from June, 1750, till about May, 1752, in which time he had a very &s;evere and dangerous &s;it of illne&s;s; being recovered, and his father dying in this year, he returned to We&s;ton-Favell, and &s;ucceeded him in that and the living of Collingtree, worth about one hun|dred and eighty pounds a year.</P>
<P>In November following he puoli&s;hed, in a letter to a lady of quality, his remarks on Lord Bollingbroke's letters on the &s;tudy and u&s;e of hi&s;tory, &s;o far as they relate to the hi&s;tory of the Old Te&s;tament, and e&s;pe|cially to the ca&s;e of Noah denouncing a cur&s;e upon Canaan; the next year he pub|li&s;hed, for the benefit of a poor &s;ick child, a &s;ermon which he preached at the vi&s;itati|on of the Archdeacon of Northampton, un|der the title of "The Cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, the Chri&s;tian's glory;" a few months afterwards he wrote a recommendatory preface to Burnham's pious memorials.</P>
<P>In 1755 he publi&s;hed his Theron and A&s;|pa&s;io, or dialogues and letters on the mo&s;t important and intere&s;ting &s;ubjects, which met with great approbation from the un|prejudiced and di&s;cerning, excepting tho&s;e who differed in religious &s;entiments from Mr. Hervey, concerning the imputed righ|teou&s;ne&s;s
<PB N="17" REF="030558_0014_0FE7CA46B21A9960">of Chri&s;t, of which the&s;e dia|logues principally treat; e&s;pecially the Re|verend Mr. John We&s;ley, Sandeman, and a few others <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Rev. Mr. John We&s;ley, Sandeman, and &s;everal other per&s;ons, publi&s;hed letters in an&s;wer, or rather oppo&s;ition to Mr. Hervey's Theron and A&s;pa&s;io, &s;ome little time after the publica|tion of the latter; endeavouring to prove Mr. Hervey's &s;enti|ments erroneous and un&s;criptural, which Mr. Hervey together with &s;everal friends and e&s;pou&s;ers of his tenets an&s;wered. <HI>(See a De&s;ence of Theren and A&s;pa&s;io, printed for C. Dilly in the Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|try</HI>)</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In Augu&s;t 1757, Mr. Hervey publi&s;hed three &s;ermons which he had preached on public fa&s;t-days, to which have been &s;ince added, his vi&s;itation &s;ermon preached in 1753, his po&s;thumous &s;ermon on <Q>the mi|ni&s;try of Reconciliation,</Q> and his <Q>Con|&s;iderations on the prevailing cu&s;tom or fa|&s;hion of vi&s;iting on Sundays;</Q> all which evidently manife&s;ted his genuine piety, and earne&s;t de&s;ire to promote the cau&s;e and in|tere&s;t of his great Lord and Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>In this year al&s;o, he publi&s;hed a new edi|tion of his favorite author, Mr. Jenk's Me|ditations, in two volumes, with a &s;trong re|commendatory preface, &s;hewing the u&s;e and excellency of them; but his conititution be|ing weak, and his illne&s;s (which was of the con&s;umptive kind, under which he had la|boured for &s;everal months, with &s;ingular pa|tience
<PB N="18" REF="030558_0015_0FE7CA4B49FED298">and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion) increa&s;ing on him a|bout October, 1758, gave great rea&s;on to fear his u&s;efulne&s;s would &s;oon be terminated, as it proved; for on the 2d of December following, in the evening, after praying with his family, he &s;eemed to be arre&s;ted by the &s;troke of death, &s;o that it was with difficul|ty his &s;i&s;ter and &s;ervant got him up &s;tairs to his own room: from this time, growing wor&s;e every day, he became &s;en&s;ible that his end was near. He had now frequent and violent fits of the cramp, which gave him great pain, and a he&s;tic cough, which was &s;o bad at night, that he could &s;eldom lie in bed till four o'clock in the morning, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Hervey, when in health, u&s;ually got up about &s;ix in the morning in winter, and much earlier in &s;ummer.</NOTE> and oblig|ed him often to get up at two.</P>
<P>On the 15th of this month he complain|ed of a pain in his &s;ide, for which he was blooded, at his own de&s;ire, though again&s;t the con&s;ent of his worthy friend and phy&s;i|cian Dr. Stonhou&s;e; who apprehen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d him too weak to bear it. When the &s;urgeon came, he could &s;carcely perceive any pul&s;a|tion, and therefore took away only four oun|ces of blood, intimating to tho&s;e around, that the ca&s;e was de&s;perate.</P>
<P>The Rev. Mr. Abraham Maddocks, his
<PB N="19" REF="030558_0016_0FE7CA4D63E1CA80">curate, being with him in the afternoon, Mr. Hervey &s;poke to him in very &s;trong and pathetic terms of his a&s;&s;urance of faith, and of the love of God in Chri&s;t. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e were his expre&s;&s;ions, <Q>O what and how much has Chri&s;t done for me, and how little have I done for &s;o loving a Saviour! If I preached even once a week, it was at la&s;t a bur|den to me; I have not vi&s;ited the people of my pari&s;h as I ought to have done, and thus have preached as it were from hou&s;e to hou&s;e; I have not taken every opportunity of &s;peak|ing for Chri&s;t.</Q> The&s;e expre&s;&s;ions were accompanied with fears, which, le&s;t they &s;hould be mi&s;interpreted, as they had been conver&s;ing of his approaching end, and his a&s;&s;urance of faith, he proceeded thus:&mdash;<Q>Don't think that I am afraid to die; I a&s;&s;ure you I am not. I know what my Saviour has done for me, and I want to be gone; but I wonder and lament to think of the love of Chri&s;t, in doing &s;o much for me, and how little I have done for him.</Q>
&mdash;In another conver&s;ation, di&s;cour&s;ing likewi&s;e of his ap|proaching di&s;&s;olution (which he always did with the utmo&s;t calmne&s;s and &s;erenity,) and of the little which we know of God's word, he &s;aid, <Q>How many precious texts are there, big with the mo&s;t rich truths of Chri&s;t, which we cannot comprehend, which we know nothing of; and of tho&s;e we do know, how few do we remember? A good textuary is a good divine, and that is the armour, the word of God is the &s;word. Tho&s;e texts are the weapons which I mu&s;t u&s;e, when that &s;ubtle &s;pirit that arch-adver&s;ary of mankind, comes to tempt and &s;ift me in my la&s;t conflict. Surely I had need be well provided with the&s;e weapons; I had need have my qui|ver full of them, to an&s;wer Satan with texts out of the word of God when he a&s;&s;aults me.</Q></NOTE>On the nineteenth the pains of his body abated, and he grew drow&s;y and lethargic; the next day Dr. Stonhou&s;e came to &s;ee him, and decla|red, in his opinion, Mr. Hervey could not live above four days longer. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The Doctor happening, on this vi&s;it, to &s;peak of the many con&s;olations through Chri&s;t, which a good man enjoys in the pro&s;pect of death; and di&s;cour&s;ing on the emptine&s;s of worldly honour to an immortal, and the unprofitablene&s;s of riches to the ungodly Mr. Hervey replied, <Q>True, Doctor, true; the only valuable trea&s;ures are in heaven; what would it avail me now, to be archbi&s;hop of Canterbury. Di&s;ea&s;e would &s;hew no re|&s;pect to my mitre. It is godline&s;s and not grandeur that will avail me hereafter. The go&s;pel is offered to me, a poor coun|try par&s;on, the &s;ame as it is to his Grace. Chri&s;t makes no difference between us. Oh! why then do mini&s;ters thus ne|glect the charge of &s;o kind a Saviour; fawn upon the great, and hunt after worldly preferments with &s;o much eagerne&s;s, to the di&s;grace of our orders? The&s;e, the&s;e are the things, Doctor, and not our poverty or ob&s;curity which render the clergy &s;o ju&s;tly contemptible to the worldlings. No wonder the &s;ervice of our church, grieved I am to &s;ay it, is become &s;uch a formal lifele&s;s thing, &s;ince it is, alas! too generally exe|cuted by per&s;ons dead to godline&s;s in all their conver&s;ation; who&s;e indifferent religion and worldly minded behaviour pro|claim the little regard they pay to the doctrines of the Lord who bought them.</Q></NOTE></P>

<P>The day before his death, Mr. Hervey went a few &s;teps acro&s;s his room, but find|ing his &s;trength &s;ailing him, he &s;unk, rather than fell down, his fall being broken by his &s;i&s;ter, who ob&s;erving his weakne&s;s ran and caught him; but he fainted away, and was to all human appearance dead, it being a con&s;iderable time before any pul&s;e could be perceived.</P>
<P>When he came to him&s;elf, and his bro|ther, Mr. William Hervey, who was come from London to vi&s;it him, &s;aid, we were afraid you was gone; he an&s;wered, <Q>I wi&s;h I had.</Q> And well he might wi&s;h &s;o, con&s;idering his painful and melancholy con|dition; for his &s;trength was exhau&s;ted, his
<PB N="21" REF="030558_0018_0FE7CA55A2F2EA28">body extremely emaciated, and his bones &s;o &s;ore that he could not bear any one to touch him hardly, when it was nece&s;&s;ary to move him; yet in the mid&s;t of his &s;uf|ferings, he was ever prai&s;ing God, for his mercies <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He never received a bit of lemon to moi&s;ten his mouth, without thanking God for his goodne&s;s, in creating &s;o many helps and refre&s;hments to a &s;ick decaying body.</NOTE>, and for granting him patience <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">A few years before he died, when Mr. Hervey was at his brother's hou&s;e in London, he had a &s;evere fever, in which he had &s;everal bli&s;ters; on this occa&s;ion Mr. William Hervey writ|ing to one of his intimate friends &s;ays, <Q>My brother is indeed an example of patience; he has not &s;poke one &s;ingle word of peevi&s;hne&s;s during his whole illne&s;s.</Q></NOTE></P>
<P>On the 25th (Chri&s;tmas day) on which he died, Mr. Maddocks paying him a morn|ing vi&s;it, Mr. Hervey lift his head and opened his eyes, as he fat in his ea&s;y chair (for he could not lie down) to &s;ee who it was, and &s;aid, "Sir, I cannot talk with you now."</P>
<P>He complained much all the day of a great inward con&s;lict, which he had, lay|ing his hand upon his brea&s;t, and &s;aying, <Q>O! you know not how great a conflict I have.</Q> During this time he almo&s;t con|&s;tantly lift his eyes towards heaven, with his hands cla&s;ped together in praying form, and &s;aid two or three times,&mdash;<Q>When this great conflict is over, then&mdash;</Q> but &s;aid

Mr. Hervey &s;trong|ly and affectionately urged on him the im|portance and care of his everla&s;ting con|cerns, as here is no abiding place; and in|treated him not to be over-charged with the cares of this life, but to attend to the one thing needful.</P>
<Q><L>"Which done, the poore&s;t can no wants endure,</L>
<L>"And which not done, the riche&s;t mu&s;t be poor. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Hervey was very fond of, and u&s;ed frequently to re|peat the&s;e lines with a peculiar empha&s;is.</NOTE>"</L></Q>
<BIBL>POPE.</BIBL>
<P>The doctor &s;eeing the great difficulty and pain with which he &s;poke (for he was al|mo&s;t &s;uffocated with phlegm and frequent vomitings) and finding by his pul&s;e, that the pangs of death were then coming on; de&s;ired that he would &s;pare him&s;elf: "No," &s;aid he, <Q>Doctor, no; you tell me I have but a few moments to live, O! let me &s;pend them in adoring our great Re|deemer.</Q> He then repeated the 26th ver&s;e of the lxxiii P&s;alm; <Q>Though my fle&s;h and my heart fail me, yet God is the &s;trength of my heart and my porti|on for ever.</Q></P>
<P>A little while after this he expatiated in
<PB N="23" REF="030558_0020_0FE7CA5CF920CD38">a mo&s;t &s;triking manner on the 1&s;t of Co|rinthians, chap. iii. ver. 22, 23. <Q>All things are yours, life and death;&mdash;for ye are Chri&s;t's.</Q> "Here," &s;ays he, <Q>is the trea&s;ure of a Chri&s;tian. Death is reckoned among this inventory, and a noble trea&s;ure it is. How thankful am I for death, as it is the pa&s;&s;age through which I pa&s;s to the Lord and Giver of eternal life; and as it frees me from all this mi&s;ery, you now &s;ee me endure, and which I am willing to endure as long as God thinks fit; for I know he will by and by, in his own good time, di&s;mi&s;s me from the body. The&s;e light afflicti|ons are but for a moment, and then comes an eternal weight of glory. Oh welcome, welcome death! thou maye&s;t well be reckoned among the trea&s;ures of the Chri&s;tian&mdash;To live is Chri&s;t, but to die is gain <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Philippians, i. 21.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>Here he pau&s;ed a little, and then with great &s;erenity and &s;weetne&s;s in his counte|nance, repeated tho&s;e words: <Q>Lord, now lette&s;t thou thy &s;ervant depart in peace, according to thy mo&s;t holy and comfort|able words, for mine eyes have &s;een thy precious &s;alvation <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Luke ii. 29, 30.</NOTE>.</Q> <Q>Here, Doctor, is my cordial: what are all the cordials
<PB N="24" REF="030558_0021_0FE7CA62B6164C58">given to &s;upport the dying in compari|&s;on of that, which ari&s;es from the pro|mi&s;es of &s;alvation by Chri&s;t? this, this &s;upports me.</Q>&mdash;About three o'clock he &s;aid, <Q>the great conflict is over, now all is done.</Q> After which he &s;carce &s;poke any words intelligibly, except now and then, "precious &s;alvation."</P>
<P>During the la&s;t hour he &s;aid nothing, but leaned his head again&s;t the &s;ide of his ea&s;y chair, and in this po&s;ture, without a &s;igh, groan, or &s;truggle, &s;hut his eyes eternally on this world, and died in the Lord, be|tween four and five o'clock in the afternoon of Chri&s;tmas day, 1758, and in the forty-fifth year of his age.</P>
<P>When his body was conveyed to the &s;ilent chambers of the grave, it was cover|ed by his own expre&s;s de&s;ire with the poor's pall, and he was buried under the commu|nion table in the chancel of We&s;ton-Favell church, on Friday, December 28th, in the pre&s;ence of a numerous congregation, full of regret for the lo&s;s of &s;o excellent a pa&s;|tor: his funeral indeed was a mo&s;t awful and very affecting &s;ight. Mr. Maddocks, his curate, who buried him, was him&s;elf in tears;&mdash;&s;ome were wringing their hands, others &s;obbing; many were &s;ilently weep|ing,
<PB N="25" REF="030558_0022_0FE7CA6449FC4640">but all were inwardly and &s;incerely grieved, as their looks &s;ufficiently te&s;tified.</P>
<P>It may truly be &s;aid of him, that few lives have ever been more heavenly:&mdash;few deaths have ever been more triumphant.&mdash; He died in the Lord, and is now at re&s;t, where even the wicked cea&s;e from trou|bling: his name is recorded in the annals of eternity, and the honours conferred on him by Chri&s;t, will for ever continue blooming and incorruptible in the world of glory.</P>
<P>His character, both in his public and private capacity, was of the mo&s;t exem|plary kind.</P>
<P>As a mini&s;ter he performed all the du|ties of that office with the greate&s;t &s;trict|ne&s;s. &mdash;In the pulpit he was earne&s;t and fervent, and &s;hewed that he felt the effi|cacy of what he preached. Nor did he think it &s;ufficient to preach on Sabbaths only, but &s;et up a weekly lecture eve|ry Wedne&s;day evening at We&s;ton-Favell church. The la&s;t two or three years of his life he could &s;carce do any thing more than preach once on the Sabbath, when people from many miles around flocked to hear him. His Wedne&s;day evening lecture at &s;even, he di&s;continued for the la&s;t year. He had not been able for &s;ome time to
<PB N="26" REF="030558_0023_0FE7CA6A02FC1578">preach at Collingtree, or to vi&s;it his pa|ri&s;hioners at their own hou&s;es, as his cu&s;|tom had been; but he encouraged them to come to him, and to conver&s;e freely up|on the &s;ubjects relating to their eternal in|tere&s;ts, and on &s;uch occa&s;ions he would &s;peak with a force and propriety peculiar to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>He always preached without notes, ex|cept on &s;ome very particular occa&s;ions; and his method was judicious, clear, and not encumbered with too many &s;ubdivi&s;i|ons. His weakne&s;s rendering him for &s;e|veral months before his death incapable of &s;peaking to his congregation as u&s;ual, he &s;hortened his di&s;cour&s;es, and took a mo&s;t u&s;eful method of inculcating his in&s;tructi|ons; for after he had expounded his text, and divided his &s;ermon into two heads, (rarely into more, and never exceeding three) he would &s;peak brie&s;ly, and at the conclu|&s;ion of each head en&s;orce what he had &s;aid, by a pertinent text of &s;cripture, de&s;iring his congregation (which was generally very numerous) to turn to their bibles, and dou|ble down the text. "Now", added he, <Q>my dear brethren, if you forget my &s;er|mon, you cannot forget God's word in this text, unle&s;s you wilfully throw your bibles a&s;ide. Shew the&s;e to your chil|dren, or the ab&s;ent part of your family
<PB N="27" REF="030558_0024_0FE7CA6B8E286F78">when you return home.</Q>&mdash;Then he gave a &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">riking exhortation, at the end of it another text for them to double down, &s;o that he had always three texts; in order to their finding of which, he pau&s;ed in the pulpit two or three minutes.</P>
<P>He endeavoured as much as po&s;&s;ible to dive&s;t him&s;elf in his public di&s;cour&s;es of his u&s;ual elegance of &s;tile, and to adapt his lan|guage to the lowe&s;t capacity. In this he followed the example of Luther, who in his table talk &s;ays, <Q>If in my preaching I were to pay a regard to Philip Melancthon, and other learned divines, then I &s;hould do lit|tle good. I preach in the plaine&s;t man|ner to the illiterate, and that gives con|tent to all.</Q></P>
<P>His method of catechi&s;ing children in church, and of &s;peaking to them in private, was very engaging and u&s;eful. He would a&s;k not only &s;uch que&s;tions as were &s;uitable to the words of the catechi&s;m, but al&s;o &s;uch as would &s;trike at the capital vices of his pa|ri&s;hioners, yet without giving per&s;onal of|fence.</P>
<P>Some of his pari&s;hioners having lain in bed on the Sabbath morning longer than he approved, and others having been bu&s;y in foddering their cattle when he was coming
<PB N="28" REF="030558_0025_0FE7CA715FD33F50">to church, and &s;everal having frequented the alehou&s;e, he thus catechi&s;ed one of the chil|dren before the congregation:&mdash;Repeat me the fourth commandment. Now, little man, do you under&s;tand the meaning of this com|mandment? Yes &s;ir.&mdash;Then if you do, you will be able to an&s;wer me the&s;e que&s;ti|ons. &mdash;Do they keep holy the Sabbath-day who lie in bed till eight or nine o'clock in the morning in&s;tead of ri&s;ing to &s;ay their prayers and read the Bible? No &s;ir.&mdash;Do tho&s;e keep the Sabbath who fodder their cattle when other people are going to church? No &s;ir.&mdash;Does God Almighty ble&s;s &s;uch people as go to alehou&s;es, and do not mind the in&s;tructions of their mini&s;ter? No &s;ir?&mdash;Do not tho&s;e that love God read the bible to their &s;amilies, particularly on Sabbath-day evening, and have prayers eve|ry morning and night in their hou&s;es? Yes &s;ir.</P>
<P>He u&s;ually breakfa&s;ted at nine, after hav|ing called his family together, and required each of his &s;ervants to repeat by heart the text which he had explained the preceding evening, and then he would recapitulate his expo&s;ition; by which method both his text and commentary were imprinted on their memories: after this he had prayers.</P>
<P>In the afternoon when he was called down
<PB N="29" REF="030558_0026_0FE7CA72ECA22D90">to tea, he u&s;ually brought his Hebrew Bible or Greek Te&s;tament with him, and would &s;peak either upon one or more ver&s;es, as occa&s;ion offered; and in the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on he would now and then drink tea, when his health would permit him, with &s;ome of his mo&s;t &s;erious pari&s;hioners; and then five or &s;ix of the neighbours were invited; and Mr. Hervey's conver&s;ation was remarkably im|proving, as he had a happy talent at &s;piritu|alizing almo&s;t every incident, and was natu|rally of a mo&s;t obliging and cheerful di&s;po&s;i|tion.</P>
<P>In the exerci&s;e of his charity, he cho&s;e to clothe the poor rather than to give them money: and he would get &s;ome judicious per&s;on to buy linen, coar&s;e cloth, &s;tockings, &s;hoes, &amp;c. for them at the be&s;t hand: al|ledging that the poor could not purcha&s;e on &s;uch good terms what they wanted at the lit|tle &s;hops, and with &s;mall &s;ums of money. "I am, &s;aid he, God's &s;teward for the poor, and I mu&s;t hu&s;band the little pittance I have to be&s;tow upon them, and make it go as far as po&s;&s;ible." But when money would be really &s;erviceable to a family, as to a prudent hou&s;e-keeper, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by &s;ickne&s; or mi&s;|fortunes, he would give five or more guineas at a time; taking care that it &s;hould not be known whence the money came. He was particularly de&s;irous of getting the advice of
<PB N="30" REF="030558_0027_0FE7CA78A6D02C28">a phy&s;ician (or at lea&s;t of &s;ome judicious a|pothecary) for the &s;ick poor; and was ever ready to procure them the very be&s;t medi|cines. He would frequently petition &s;uch phy&s;icians of his acquaintance in different parts of the kingdom, as he apprehended to be charitably di&s;po&s;ed, to give their advice occa&s;ionally when they rode through a town, to &s;uch poor creatures, as the clergyman of the place, or &s;ome &s;ub&s;tantial inhabitant, &s;hould recommend, as real objects of com|pa&s;&s;ion. He greatly di&s;approved of the clergy's attempting to give medicine to their pari&s;hioners; as he thought it impo&s;&s;ible for them to do it with the requi&s;ite judgment. "Let my brethren," he would &s;ay "give them wine, bread, or beer, and get good &s;poon-meats made for them; but medicines are of too important a nature to be given in|di&s;criminately." He ob&s;erved that by his own method the &s;ick poor had the very be&s;t medicines, as the phy&s;ician &s;aw them him&s;elf, and bought them very cheap; becau&s;e the apothecary, knowing they were for charita|ble u&s;es, charged the phy&s;ician no more than prime co&s;t, with &s;ome little allowance mere|ly for his trouble in compounding them; and as the phy&s;ician knew what di&s;ea&s;es were curable, there was no wa&s;te of medi|cine in fruitle&s;s attempts to cure ca&s;es, which, though actually incurable, per&s;ons of le&s;s judgment could not pronounce to be &s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="030558_0028_0FE7CA7A34D5B220">
He gave away a great number of good books, with &s;uitable in&s;tructions for their u&s;e, and e&s;pecially Bibles. In the blank leaf he frequently wrote &s;omething &s;triking, or el&s;e &s;tuck in a printed paper, relating to the promi&s;es of God in and through Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>His income was but &s;mall, and it may be wondered how he managed it &s;o well, as to have &s;uch large &s;ums to &s;pare for cha|ritable u&s;es. He &s;old the copy of his Me|ditations, after it had pa&s;&s;ed through &s;eve|ral editions; which &s;ale of the copy, and the profits of the former impre&s;&s;ions, a|mounted to about &pound;.700, all which he gave away in charity. He made of it a bank for the poor. "This," &s;aid he, <Q>I have devoted to God, I will on no account apply it to any worldly u&s;es: I write not for profit or for fame, but to &s;erve the cau&s;e of God; and as he has ble&s;&s;ed my attempt, I think my&s;elf bound to re|lieve the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of my fellow creatures with the profit that comes from this quarter.</Q> He has likewi&s;e left all the future profits of his works to &s;ome of the charitable u&s;es above &s;pecified.</P>
<P>In any expence relating to him&s;elf, he was extremely frugal, that he might be li|beral to others; and it was always his de|&s;ire
<PB N="32" REF="030558_0029_0FE7CA8000EF9408">to die ju&s;t even with the world. <Q>I will be my own executor,</Q> &s;aid he. And as he died on Chri&s;tmas day, his fund ex|pired almo&s;t with his life. What little re|mained, he de&s;ired might be given in warm clothing to the poor in that &s;evere &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>To the in&s;tances of his charity we may properly add an incident which affords a very &s;trong proof, not only of the benevo|lence of his heart, but of his regard to practical religion, and to the doing of eve|ry good work within his power.</P>
<P>A day or two before his death, when he was reduced to &s;uch extreme weakne&s;s as to be unable to read, and could with diffi|culty &s;peak, a little account being &s;ettled with him by a friend, on the balance of which he received eighteen &s;hillings, look|ing on the money with great indifference, he expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to this effect, "I would gladly di&s;po&s;e of this &s;mall &s;um in &s;uch a manner as may do the mo&s;t good; it is the only act which I now am, and probably the la&s;t that I &s;hall be able to per&s;orm. Give your&s;elf the trouble of looking among&s;t the&s;e books, and you will find Mr. Rich|ard's pamphlet, at the latter end of which are, I remember, &s;ome hints concerning the means of promoting religion in our&s;elves and others, which (even with &s;ome additi|ons
<PB N="33" REF="030558_0030_0FE7CA818CC02518">and improvements, which you might ea&s;ily make) will not fill more than a &s;heet of paper; and if &s;tuck up or framed, might be particularly u&s;eful in that form; let then &s;uch a number of them be printed and giv|en away as this money will admit of." His orders were properly executed, and the evi|dences of &s;uch an angelic temper were equally matter of edification and comfort to his friends, as this charitable legacy (if we may &s;o call it) will be to all who receive and rightly u&s;e it.</P>
<P>This incident, it is to be hoped, will be candidly con&s;idered by tho&s;e who draw &s;uch inferences from his favourite doctrine, and &s;trong expre&s;&s;ions of the all-&s;ufficient righ|teou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, as his whole life did in the mo&s;t exemplary manner confute. No man had ever a greater di&s;regard for money, which he e&s;teemed unworthy of his notice, upon any other account than as it furni&s;h|ed him with the means of doing good. Sure|ly we may here borrow the &s;entiment and expre&s;&s;ion of our celebrated poet, and ju&s;t|ly conclude, that,
<Q>"He felt his ruling pa&s;&s;ion &s;trong in death."</Q></P>
<P>In learning he was inferior to few. Greek was almo&s;t as familiar to him as his native language. He was a great ma&s;ter of the
<PB N="34" REF="030558_0031_0FE7CA873B326758">cla&s;&s;ics; and in the younger part of his life had written &s;ome ver&s;es, which &s;hewed no contemptible genius for poetry. He had a critical knowledge of the Hebrew tongue, and delighted in it.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to his private capacity, he was never known to be in a pa&s;&s;ion. No worldly concerns (though he &s;ometimes met with very trying ones) ever effected him. His humility rendered him invulne|rable. When he was mi&s;repre&s;ented and calumniated, he would &s;ay, "Our enemies are &s;ometimes our be&s;t friends, and tell us truths; and then we &s;hould amend our faults, and be thankful for &s;uch informati|on; and if what they &s;ay be not true, and only &s;poke through malice, then &s;uch per|&s;ons are to be con&s;idered as di&s;ea&s;ed in their minds, and we ought to pray for them. They are to be pitied," &s;ays he, "and I might as ju&s;tly be angry with a man that is di&s;ea&s;ed in his body."

<P>FROM the foregoing account of Mr. Hervey, it evidently appears he was a truly good man in life, as well as by <HI>profe&s;|&s;ion</HI>; indeed I do not remember ever to have read, or conver&s;ed with any one concerning him, but what joined in acknowledging his title to the character and appellation of <HI>a real Chri&s;tian.</HI></P>
<P>Tho&s;e who differed from him in religious &s;entiments, could not but acknowledge that he wrote as became a man of true piety; and greatly e&s;teemed him for that candour,

<P>"A more diligent, di&s;tingui&s;hed and &s;uc|ce&s;sful labourer in the church of Chri&s;t, has perhaps &s;eldom appeared; and in few characters was there ever a more happy conjunction of the gentleman, the &s;cholar, and the Chri&s;tian. The upright heart, the deep humility, under all his attainments, the warme&s;t love to mankind in endeavours to promote their be&s;t intere&s;ts, the mo&s;t zea|lous attachments to truth, the noble&s;t de|fence, as well as the daily practice of evan|gelical holine&s;s, the utmo&s;t &s;erenity of mind under the mo&s;t grievous afflictions, and a perfect re&s;ignation to the will of his hea|venly Father, are a few of the outlines of his character, and ju&s;tly repre&s;ent him to have been a burning and &s;hining light to the world.

<P>Facing the entrance lay a &s;pacious gra&s;&s;y walk, terminated by an octangular ba&s;on, with a curious <HI>Jet d' Eau</HI> playing in the cen|tre.

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q>Train up a child in the way he &s;hould go, and when he is old he will not depart from it. <HI>Proverbs, xxii. 6.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT has long been a prevailing report, that, among per&s;ons of education and di&s;tinction, true religon is very rare. This, I would hope, is an invidious rumour, rather than a true repre&s;entation of the ca&s;e. May it not be an attifice of the grand enemy? calculated to bring the be&s;t and noble&s;t of cau&s;es into di&s;repute: as though politene&s;s and piety were incon&s;i&s;tent: as though grace and good-breeding were irreconcileable.&mdash; Is then the faith of Chri&s;t quite fatal to refin|ed

<P><PB N="207" REF="030558_0204_0FE7CCF20248BF50">
I my&s;elf have known various per&s;ons, ad|mired for their accompli&s;hed behaviour, and revered for their exalted &s;tation, who have thought it their highe&s;t honour to be &s;ervants of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. My excellent friend Camillus, at who&s;e hou&s;e I now re|&s;ide, is one of the number. I cannot refrain from giving a portrait of Camillus; or rather of a few of his mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hing features: for, to paint him in full proportion, as he daily appears, in all the mild, the benign maje&s;ty of dome&s;tic authority, parental go|vernment, and Chri&s;tian zeal&mdash;To do this, would require a much abler hand than mine.</P>
<P>Camillus, not long ago, entertained in his hou&s;e a young clergyman, who was always treated with a re&s;pect &s;uitable to the dignity of his office, and the piety of his behaviour. I having larely pre&s;ented the worthy eccle&s;i|a&s;tic to a living, and always requiring re|&s;idence on the benefice, he is now de&s;titute of a chaplain. Remembering, however, that all Chri&s;tians are &s;piritual prie&s;ts; he thinks it no di&s;honour to have an imme|diate and per&s;onal audience with the King of Heaven; not acting at all out of character to repe&s;ent the wants of his hou&s;hold, with his own mouth, at the throne of grace.</P>
<P>Before &s;upper is introduced, the evening
<PB N="208" REF="030558_0205_0FE7CCF7B7914BC8">incen&s;e a&s;cends. This rather than a later hour, is pitched upon, that the little congre|gation may join in the &s;acred &s;ervice, with a lively devotion. After a plentiful meal, when the limbs are weary, people, even though kneeling, and in the pre&s;ence of God, are more inclined to nod, than to pour out their &s;ouls; are very apt to mi&s;take the cu|&s;hion for a pillow.&mdash;No &s;ervant is allowed to be ab&s;ent, one only excepted, who&s;e pre&s;ence in the kitchen is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. Ac|quainted with their ma&s;ter's re&s;olution, they are careful, &s;o to manage their affairs, and di&s;patch their bu&s;ine&s;s, that no unavoidable ob&s;tacle may intervene to detain them from the &s;tated wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>When all are a&s;&s;embled, without either tumultuous di&s;order in their approach, or a &s;lovenly negligence in their apparel, a chap|ter is read. Camillus makes the choice.&mdash; He imagines it not &s;o u&s;eful for his family, who&s;e momories are weak, and their capaci|ties &s;canty, to read the le&s;&s;on for the day.&mdash; He has, therefore, &s;elected &s;ome of the mo&s;t in&s;tructive and animating portions of &s;crip|ture; and judges it advi&s;eable to peru&s;e the&s;e again and again, rather than to go regularly through the whole in&s;pired writings.&mdash;The &s;ervants take it by turns to read, which im|proves them in the practice, and keeps them awake. If any of them di&s;covers a di&s;po&s;i|
<PB N="209" REF="030558_0206_0FE7CCF947CA9548">of &s;leep, to him the office is &s;ure to be a&s;&s;igned.</P>
<P>When the chapter is fini&s;hed, Camillus &s;ingles out &s;ome one ver&s;e, of very weighty and edifying import, which, for the &s;pace of five or &s;ix minutes, he explains, applies, and affectionately urges upon their con&s;ciences. This done, with great &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and pro|found reverence, he offers up evening pray|ers. His prayers con&s;i&s;ts of &s;hort &s;entences, and the whole is performed in a little time. Every part is pronounced with that deliber|ate &s;lowne&s;s and &s;olemn accent, which com|mand attention and create awe. He makes a very perceivable pau&s;e at the clo&s;e of each petition that every one may have lei&s;ure to add, in &s;ilence, a hearty amen; and to recol|lect the merits of that ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer, which render every thank&s;giving acceptable, and every &s;upplication &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>In the morning, before breakfa&s;t, the wor|&s;hip of the living God is renewed. At this juncture Camillus omits the chapter, but re|quires one of his dome&s;tics to repeat the ver&s;e on which he enlarged the proceeding night. None knows which &s;hall be called to this ta&s;k, therefore every one is obilged to be properly prepared. He throws the &s;ub|&s;tance of his exhortation into a few &s;caren|ing and intere&s;ting que&s;tions, which he ad|dre&s;&s;es
<PB N="210" REF="030558_0207_0FE7CCFEF6201440">to one of his children or &s;ervants&mdash; for, in this pre&s;pect, no difference is made.&mdash; All are equally enjoined to remember. Some times he encourages tho&s;e who&s;e an&s;wers &s;hew that they have given diligent heed to his in&s;tructions. Sometimes he puts on an air of &s;everity, mixed with tenderne&s;s, and re|proves the notoricu&s;ly negligent. Always he re-inculcates the principal points, charg|ing them to retain the doctrines in their me|mory, and revolve them in their thoughts, while they are pur&s;uing their re&s;pective bu&s;i|ne&s;s &mdash;The&s;e doctrines are the &s;eed of faith, the root of godline&s;s. Unle&s;s the&s;e be lod|ged in the mind, and operate on the heart, he never expects to have his dome&s;tics com|mence true believers, or real Chri&s;tians. No more than the hu&s;bandman can rea&s;onably expect a crop in harve&s;t without &s;owing his field, or the flori&s;t promi&s;e him&s;elf a blow of tulips, without planting his parterre.</P>
<P>I have given a glimp&s;e of Camillus at the head of his family; let me now &s;hew my fa|vourite in another attitude.&mdash;Camillus is convinced that no tru&s;t is of &s;uperior or of equal importance to the tuitionary cultivati|on of an immortal &s;oul. As providence has ble&s;&s;ed him with two fine daughters, their pre&s;ent and future happine&s;s is the reigning object of his care. He has no intere&s;t &s;o much at heart as to give them a truly refined education, &s;uch as may render them an orna|ment

<P>Camillus never could per&s;uade him&s;elf to admire the maxims of prudence &s;aid to be gathered from the extravagant rant of our tragedies; and le&s;s is his e&s;teem for tho&s;e mode&s;t di&s;po&s;itions, which people pretend to imbibe from the lucious gallantries of comedy; for which rea&s;on he has no impati|ent de&s;ire to &s;ecure for Mi&s;s Meti&s;&s;a and Mi&s;s Serena a place in the front box.&mdash;Howe|ver, as we are apt immoderately to covet what is ab&s;olutely forbidden, he has him&s;elf attended them, once or twice, to the thea|trical entertainments and public diver&s;ions; thinking it much the &s;afe&s;t method, that their curio&s;ity &s;hould be gratified under his own in&s;pection and hoping to make them &s;en&s;ible how much they endanger their vir|tue, who too often frequent them; how &s;hamefully they deba&s;e their affections, who are pa&s;&s;ionately fond of them; and what mere phantoms they follow, who &s;eek for &s;atisfaction in &s;uch delu&s;ory delights.</P>

They will tell you the peculiar commodi|ties which each climate produces; whence comes the tea that furni&s;hes their breakfa&s;t, and whence the &s;ugar that renders it pala|table: what mountains &s;upply them with wines, and what i&s;lands &s;end them their &s;pices; in what groves the &s;ilk-worms &s;pin the materials for their cloaths, and what mines &s;upply them with the dimonds that &s;parkle in their earrings.&mdash;A &s;creen covered with a &s;et of coloured maps, and a cu&s;tom of referring from the public papers to tho&s;e beautiful draughts, has rendered the acqui|&s;ition of this knowledge a diver&s;ion rather than a ta&s;k, has enticed them into a valuable branch of &s;cience, under the inviting di&s;gui&s;e of amu&s;ement.

You would have been delight|ed to ob&s;erve the behaviour of our little land|lady on this occa&s;ion; the engaging conde|&s;cen&s;ion with which &s;he addre&s;&s;ed the hone&s;t ru&s;tic; the tender good-nature with which &s;he enquired after his dame and the family at home; the ready dexterity with which &s;he wrote and &s;ub&s;cribed a proper receipt; and, above all, her amiable genero&s;ity in return|ing half a crown to buy a copy-book for his elde&s;t &s;on, who he &s;aid, "was ju&s;t going in|to joining hand, but the feared would never come to &s;pell or write half &s;o well as her la|dy&s;hip."</P>
<P>Though Camillus is careful to ground them betimes in the rules of oeconomy, he is equally careful to cultivate a &s;pirit of di&s;creet beneficence. A few days ago, when my friend and his lady were abroad, Mi&s;s Meti&s;&s;a was informed of a poor woman in the pari&s;h, ju&s;t brought to bed, after a long and hard labour; who, being unhappily married to a &s;ot of a fellow, was, at a time when the choice&s;t com|forts
<PB N="216" REF="030558_0213_0FE7CD1485777D88">were &s;carcely &s;ufficient, de&s;titute of the meane&s;t conveniences. Upon hearing the calamitous ca&s;e, &s;he immediately di&s;|patched a &s;ervant with a crown from her weekly &s;tock; part to buy for the afflicted creature &s;ome pre&s;ent accomodations, and part to defray the expences at &s;uch a juncture unavoidable; but gave a &s;trict charge, that the whole &s;hould be employed for the re|lief of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed mother and her helple&s;s infant, none of it fingered or enjoyed by the worthle&s;s drone her hu&s;band. When Ca|millus returned, he was &s;o plea&s;ed with this &s;ea&s;onable and well judged charity, that, be|&s;ides his commendation and care&s;&s;es, he far|ther rewarded our con&s;iderate and matron like benefactre&s;s, by making her a pre&s;ent of Clari&s;&s;a; for he always contrives to make what tends to their improvement, the mat|ter of their reward. If they have commit|ted a fault, they are forbid the priveledge of u&s;ing their maps. If they have behaved in a becoming manner, their recompence is, not a peice of money, or a paper of &s;weet|meats, but &s;ome new in&s;truction on the globe, &s;ome new le&s;&s;on on the harp&s;ichord, which may at once delight and improve them.</P>
<P>To prevent a haughty carriage, and to worm out all inordinate &s;elf-love, he teaches them to con&s;ider their neighbours as mem|bers of the &s;ame univer&s;al family, and chil|dren
<PB N="217" REF="030558_0214_0FE7CD16DB47EAD0">of the &s;ame Almighty Father.

One afternoon, when he was going to treat them with an orange, he bid each of them bring a fine toy, lately received for a pre&s;ent.

<PB N="218" REF="030558_0215_0FE7CD1C1543D130">bauble. But, if it is the de&s;ire of your hearts and the endeavour of your lives, to be exten|&s;ively u&s;eful, you will gain, and what is bet|ter, you will de&s;erve re&s;pect; your names will be precious, and your memories ble&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>With equal watchfulne&s;s he di&s;counte|nances all tho&s;e acts of petulant barbarity, which children are &s;o apt to exerci&s;e on the reptile creation. He will allow no court of inqui&s;ition to be erected within his hou&s;e; no, not upon the mo&s;t de&s;picable, or even the noxious animals. The very nui&s;ances that are endued with life, he thinks &s;hould be di&s;patched, not with a lingering butchery but with a merciful expedition. To rend in pieces a poor fly, and fea&s;t their eyes with the mangled limbs, &s;hivering and con|vul&s;ed in the pangs of death; to impale a wretched infect on the needle or bodkin; and, what is &s;till more &s;hocking, to take plea&s;ure in hearing its pa&s;&s;ionate moan, and &s;eeing its agonizing &s;truggles: &s;uch practices he ab&s;olutely forbids, as in&s;ufferable viola|tions of nature's law. Such as tend to ex|tingui&s;h the &s;oft emotions of pity, and inure the mind to a habit of inhumanity.&mdash;He often informs his lovely pupils, that every living creature is &s;en&s;ible of pain; that none can be abu&s;ed in this cruel manner, without &s;uffering very exqui&s;ite mitery. To turn their torments into pa&s;time, and make &s;port

<P>He propo&s;es to give them a ta&s;te of na|tural philo&s;ophy, and to accomodate them with the be&s;t micro&s;copes; that the u&s;e of <HI>the&s;e</HI> in&s;truments, and a &s;pice of <HI>that</HI> know|ledge, may in&s;pire them with an early ad|miration of nature's works, and with the deepe&s;t veneration of nature's almighty Author. Camillus has no de&s;ign to fin|i&s;h a couple of &s;emale philo&s;ophers, or to divert their attention from tho&s;e dome&s;tic arts, which are the true&s;t accompli&s;hments of the &s;ex; yet neither would he have his daughters debarred from that rational and exalted delight, which is to be found in con|templating the curio&s;ities of the great Crea|tor's cabinet. Why may they not, with|out departing from their <HI>own,</HI> or encroach|ing on the <HI>ma&s;culine</HI> character, why may they not be acquainted with the accurately nice &s;tructure of an animal; or with the proce&s;s and effects of vegetation? why may they not learn the admirable operations of the air, or the wonderfnl properties of the water? have &s;ome general notion of the im|men&s;e magnitudes, the prodigious di&s;tances, and the &s;till more amazing revolutions of the heavenly orbs? he apprehends it very

<P>The micro&s;cope, whenever they are in|clined to amu&s;e them&s;elves, will &s;hew them a pro&s;u&s;ion of &s;plendid ornaments, in &s;ome of the mo&s;t common and contemptible ob|jects.

<P>It is for want of &s;uch truly elegant and &s;a|tisfactory amu&s;ements, that &s;o many ladies of the fir&s;t di&s;tinction, and &s;ine&s;t genius, have no employ for their delicate capacities; but lo&s;e their happine&s;s in &s;lights of caprice, or fits of the vapour; lo&s;e their time in the mo&s;t

<P>Above all, Camillus is mo&s;t earne&s;tly de&s;irous to have his tender charge ground|ed in the principles, and actuated with the &s;pirit of Chri&s;tianity. No &s;cheme, he is thoroughly per&s;uaded, was ever &s;o wi&s;e|ly calculated to &s;weeten their tempers, to exalt their affections, and form them to fe|licity, either in this world, or another. It is therefore his daily endeavour, by the mo&s;t ea&s;y and endearing methods of in&s;truction, to fill their minds with the knowledge of tho&s;e heavenly doctrines, and win their hearts to the love of that invaluable book in which they are delineated.&mdash;He longs to have a &s;en&s;e of God Almighty's goodne&s;s impre&s;&s;ed on their &s;ouls, From this &s;ource, under the influences of the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ncti&s;ying Spirit, he would derive all the graces and all the duties of godline&s;s. With this view he &s;peaks of the divine Maje&s;ty, not only as &s;upereminently great, but as mo&s;t tran&s;cen|dently po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every delightful, every charming excellence.

<P>Nothing is more di&s;plea&s;ing to Camillus than the fond flatteries which their injudici|ous admirers be&s;tow on their &s;hape and com|plexion, the gracefulne&s;s of their carriage, and the vivacity of their wit.

<P>In &s;hort, the point he chiefly labours, is to work in their hearts a deep, an abiding &s;en&s;e, that God is their &s;upreme, their only good; that the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us is the rock of their hopes, and the fountain of their &s;alvati|on: that all their dependence for acquiring the beauties of holine&s;s, and ta&s;ting the joys of the &s;ublime&s;t virtue, is to be placed on the Holy Gho&s;t the comforter.&mdash;Amid&s;t all the&s;e efforts of his own, he never fails to to plead that precious promi&s;e of our un|changeable Jehovah; <HI>I will pour my &s;pirit upon thy &s;eed, and my ble&s;&s;ing upon thy offspring; and they &s;hall grow up</HI> in knowledge and grace, <HI>as willows by the water-co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">s.</HI></P>
<P>A lady of brilliant parts, but no very ex|traordinary piety, told Camillus, that he would &s;poil the pretty dears; would extin|gui&s;h that decent pride, and fondne&s;s for plea&s;ure, which are &s;hining qualifications in
