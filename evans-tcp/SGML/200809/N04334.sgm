<BIBL>I. TIM. iv. 16.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>Take heed unto thy &s;elf, and unto thy Doctrine; and continue in them: For in doing this, thou &s;halt &s;ave both thy &s;elf, and them that hear thee.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THEY are the Words of PAUL to TIMOTHY, <HI>his own Son in the Faith:</HI> And they are di|rected to him, not in his <HI>private</HI> Capacity as a <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> but an <HI>Officer</HI> in the <HI>Church</HI> of GOD; one whom JESUS CHRIST the LORD <HI>had counted faithful, putting him into the Mini&s;try.</HI> And they were, no doubt, intended for the In&s;truction and Admonition of all others, in all after Ages, to who&s;e <HI>Tru&s;t, the glorious Go&s;pel of the ble&s;&s;ed GOD, &s;hould be committed.</HI></P>
<P>And two Things are ob&s;ervable in them.</P>
<P>I. A <HI>&s;ummary Repre&s;entation of the Duty of Mini&s;ters. Take heed unto thy &s;elf, and unto thy Doctrine; continue in them.</HI></P>
<P>II. A <HI>&s;pecial Motive</HI> inforcing the Duty. <HI>For in doing this, thou &s;halt &s;ave both thy &s;elf, and them that hear thee.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="005358_0004_10182233A4AFC8E0">
Accordingly, the&s;e are the <HI>general Heads</HI> we &s;hall di&s;tinctly &s;peak to, and then fini&s;h with an <HI>Application</HI> proper to the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Day.</P>
<P>I. The fir&s;t Thing to employ our Thoughts from the Text is, the <HI>De&s;cription</HI> it gives of the <HI>Duty</HI> of <HI>Mi|ni&s;ters;</HI> &s;ummarily comprehending the three following Particulars. (1.) Their <HI>taking heed to them&s;elves.</HI> (2.) To their <HI>Doctrine.</HI> (3.) Their <HI>continuing in the&s;e Things.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Article in the <HI>Duty</HI> of <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> is, their <HI>taking heed to them&s;elves,</HI> i. e. their <HI>Minds,</HI> that they be furni&s;h'd, both with <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Gifts;</HI> and their <HI>Behaviour,</HI> that it be befitting tho&s;e, who are cloathed with the <HI>&s;acred Office.</HI> Here it may be di&s;tinctly &s;aid,</P>
<P N="1">1. If <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> would <HI>take heed to them&s;elves,</HI> they mu&s;t look to their <HI>Minds,</HI> that they be furni&s;h'd both with <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Gifts.</HI></P>
<P>They mu&s;t expre&s;s a &s;utable Care, that their <HI>Minds</HI> be furni&s;h'd with <HI>Grace.</HI> Or, in other Words, they mu&s;t &s;ee to it that they be <HI>inwardly</HI> Men of <HI>Religion; Partakers of the Divine Nature;</HI> Subjects of <HI>Faith</HI> in JESUS CHRIST, that Faith which &s;hall <HI>purify their Hearts, purge their Con|&s;ciences from dead Works,</HI> &amp; di&s;po&s;e them to an <HI>Acquie&s;|cence</HI> in the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> Method of Salvation: Nor can they otherwi&s;e be in Favour with GOD here, or have Admi&s;|&s;ion into his Kingdom hereafter. For the Way to hea|ven is <HI>one.</HI> 'Tis the &s;ame both for Mini&s;ters and People. 'Tis not meerly our being Preachers to others, that will avail to our Salvation. We mu&s;t be <HI>Men in CHRIST,</HI> ju&s;tified in his Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;anctified by his SPI|RIT; or nothing will prevent our being doom'd, at the great and la&s;t Day, to a Departure from CHRIST among the Workers of Iniquity. Our fir&s;t and chief Care there|fore &s;hould be, to experience in our own Hearts the Truths we preach to others; to be <HI>our&s;elves</HI> the <HI>regene|rate</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="005358_0005_101822354F3762C0">
Men, the <HI>new Creatures,</HI> the <HI>&s;ound Believers,</HI> we urge others to be: Nor would any Thing more happily tend to render our Mini&s;try &s;erviceable to the great and good Ends of our being intru&s;ted with it.</P>
<P>Though I would not be under&s;tood by this to &s;ugge&s;t, as if Mini&s;ters <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be endowed with <HI>&s;aving Grace,</HI> or no good Effect would follow upon their Admini&s;trations in CHRIST'S Name. I know, the <HI>In&s;trumentality</HI> of <HI>uncon|verted</HI> Mini&s;ters, in the Bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Regeneration,</HI> has, in the&s;e Days, been compared to <HI>that</HI> of a <HI>naturally dead Man in begetting Children.</HI> But this Way of repre&s;ent|ing the Matter is evidently founded on gro&s;s Ignorance of the unavoidable State of the <HI>vi&s;ible Kingdom of GOD.</HI> There is no &s;uch Thing as <HI>certainly</HI> &s;ecuring the Church of CHRIST from the Mini&s;trations of Men, not knowing the Grace of GOD in Truth. Neither <HI>People</HI> who call Men to the Work of the Mini&s;try, nor <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> who &s;eparate them to it, can look into their Hearts: Nor can they, either of them, make a Judgment of their <HI>State</HI> by any Thing but what is <HI>outward</HI> and <HI>vi&s;ible.</HI> And notwith|&s;tanding the mo&s;t &s;pecious <HI>outward</HI> Appearance, whether in Word or Deed, their Hearts may be leaven'd with <HI>Hypocri&s;y:</HI> Nor can it be <HI>known</HI> of any Mini&s;ter, on the Earth, that he is the Man <HI>inwardly,</HI> he profe&s;&s;es to be <HI>outwardly.</HI> I &s;peak not this to in&s;inuate a Su&s;picion of Mini&s;ters, as tho' they were <HI>Hypocrites.</HI> GOD forbid I &s;hould be an Encourager of &s;uch <HI>Uncharitablene&s;s,</HI> or, in this Way, lead any into an ill Opinion of them, to the Hurt of their Reputation and U&s;efulne&s;s! But what I aim at is to &s;how, that there is no knowing the <HI>inward real</HI> State of <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> any more than People; and that, after the clo&s;e&s;t Adherence to <HI>Scripture-rule</HI> in judging of them, we may be deceived, taking them for <HI>converted</HI> when they are not. And can it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that <HI>&s;anc|tifying Grace</HI> &s;hould be <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> to a <HI>regular</HI> or <HI>valid</HI> Ad|mini&s;tration of Go&s;pel-Ordinances, when 'tis the <HI>&s;ole Prerogative</HI> of the great GOD, to <HI>know</HI> the Per&s;ons that
<PB N="8" REF="005358_0006_10182237251ABFB0">
are endowed with it, and the <HI>appropriate</HI> Work of the SON of GOD, at the final Judgment, to declare who they are? Is it po&s;&s;ible <HI>that</HI> &s;hould be <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> to the <HI>Character</HI> or <HI>Succe&s;s</HI> of Mini&s;ters, in regard of which there is no Church on Earth but may be impo&s;ed on? And if Go&s;pel-Ordinances will be <HI>effectual</HI> to Salvation, <HI>only</HI> as admini&s;tred by <HI>converted</HI> Mini&s;ters, who&s;e Admi|ni&s;tration of them mu&s;t be attended on? And the Re&s;o|lution of this Que&s;tion is the more nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e, for all any Thing that we know, or indeed can know, unle&s;s by <HI>immediate Revelation from GOD,</HI> the Mini&s;ters we mo&s;t admire, and have the highe&s;t Opinion of, as eminent|ly <HI>&s;anctified</HI> Men, may be no other than <HI>whited Sepul|chres, beautiful without; but within, full of dead Men's Bones, and all Rottenne&s;s and Uncleanne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>This confining the <HI>Succe&s;s</HI> of Go&s;pel-Ordinances to the <HI>inward unknown Sanctity</HI> of the Admini&s;trators is therefore unrea&s;onable and antichri&s;tian; yea, pur&s;ued in its ju&s;t Con&s;equences, it will totally de&s;troy the U&s;e, both of <HI>Ordinances</HI> and <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> to di&s;pen&s;e them. And however &s;ome may be very fond of a Notion car|rying in it &s;o much &s;eeming Piety, and zealous in pro|pagating it to the Di&s;turbance of the Churches, and fo|menting Divi&s;ions in them, they herein depart, both from the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> and the <HI>Principles</HI> of the famous <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter A&s;&s;embly of Divines,</HI> as well as the <HI>Faith</HI> of the <HI>Forefathers</HI> of this Country, one expre&s;s Article in who&s;e Confe&s;&s;ion, con&s;ented to by their <HI>Elders</HI> and <HI>Me&s;|&s;engers,</HI> convened at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> May 12. 1660, is in the&s;e Words, <Q>The grace which is exhibited in or by the Sacraments, rightly u&s;ed, is not conferred by any Power in them: Neither doth the <HI>efficacy</HI> of a Sa|crament depend upon the <HI>Piety,</HI> or <HI>Intention</HI> of him that doth admini&s;ter it: but upon the <HI>Work of the</HI> SPIRIT, and the <HI>Word of In&s;titution,</HI> which contains, together with a Precept authori&s;ing the U&s;e thereof, a <HI>Promi&s;e</HI> of <HI>Benefit</HI> to <HI>worthy</HI> Receivers.</Q> But to go on,</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="005358_0007_1018223C58624F40">
<HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> &s;hould not only take Care that their Minds be furni&s;h'd with Grace, but with <HI>Gifts</HI> al&s;o. It may rea&s;onably be &s;uppos'd, that their <HI>natural Gifts,</HI> their <HI>mental</HI> Capacities, are above the common level: O|therwi&s;e, they certainly judged ill in de&s;iring the Of|fice of <HI>Over&s;eers</HI> in the Church of GOD; and it was ill-judged in <HI>People</HI> to call them to the Work of the Mini&s;try, and &s;till more &s;o in the Pa&s;tors of the Chur|ches who &s;eparated them to it. But it is not enough that they are endow'd with good <HI>natural</HI> Powers. The&s;e mu&s;t be well cultivated and enriched by <HI>Medita|tion</HI> and <HI>Study.</HI> In this Way, under the Influence of the ble&s;&s;ed SPIRIT, they &s;hould take Pains, that they may acquire all <HI>nece&s;&s;ary Gifts</HI> for the U&s;e of Edificati|on; Gifts for <HI>praying,</HI> and <HI>preaching,</HI> and admini&s;tring the <HI>Sacraments</HI> and <HI>Cen&s;ures</HI> of the Kingdom of CHRIST: Nor &s;hould they content them&s;elves meerly with an A|bility to do the&s;e Duties of their Office; but endea|vour after a Capacity and Readine&s;s to perform them in an agreeable Manner, &s;o as to engage the Attention, and command the E&s;teem and Veneration of their Hearers. E&s;pecially &s;hould Mini&s;ters take Care, that their <HI>preaching</HI> be &s;uch as may di&s;cover them to be Men of Knowledge and Under&s;tanding, and not Babes in Divine Things. It &s;hould appear from their Di&s;|cour&s;es, that they are able to in&s;truct the Ignorant, to re&s;olve the Doubting, to convince the Gain-&s;ayers, to awaken the Secure, to comfort the Broken-hearted; and, in a Word, that they have the Skill to adapt them&s;elves to the Ca&s;es of all Sorts of Per&s;ons, and to the various Occurrences, in divine Providence, which may be capable of being improved to the &s;piritual Ad|vantage of their People.</P>
<P>Some, perhaps, may expect to be furni&s;hed with the&s;e Qualifications for the Work of the Mini&s;try, in an <HI>extraordinary</HI> Way, without the diligent U&s;e of <HI>com|mon Means.</HI> But they herein mi&s;erably delude them|&s;elves. Even TIMOTHY was advi&s;ed by the in&s;pired
<PB N="10" REF="005358_0008_1018223DE5A14918">
PAUL, in my Context, <HI>not to neglect the Gift that was in him;</HI> but to make <HI>his profiting appear unto all, by giv|ing Attendance to Reading and Meditation.</HI> And it is in this Way, together with the U&s;e of <HI>Prayer,</HI> humbly depending on the Ble&s;&s;ing of Heaven, and in this Way <HI>only,</HI> that we may warrantably hope to acquire tho&s;e mini&s;terial Accompli&s;hments, which will be an Honor to our Profe&s;&s;ion, and render us eminently u&s;eful in the Places Divine Providence has fixed us. But,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Mini&s;ters,</HI> in taking heed to <HI>them&s;elves,</HI> &s;hould look to their <HI>Behaviour</HI> that it be befitting tho&s;e who are intru&s;ted with the Care of Souls. In Order whereto,</P>
<P>To be &s;ure, they mu&s;t not be Men of <HI>bad Lives.</HI> A <HI>vicious</HI> Mini&s;ter is one of the mo&s;t mi&s;becoming Creatures in all the World. A Teacher of others in all Godline&s;s and Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and yet prophane, un|clean, intemperate, unju&s;t, uncharitable; what a Re|proach is he to him&s;elf, and Scandal to the Profe&s;&s;ion? The Lives of &s;uch Mini&s;ters are a practical Contempt of Religion, whatever they may &s;ay in its Favour while they are <HI>preaching.</HI> The Ways of Piety, through their Means, are evil-&s;poken of, and the <HI>Son of GOD</HI> him|&s;elf reproached and bla&s;phemed. When others &s;ee the Preachers of Salvation living in tho&s;e Practices that are un&s;eemly in the Sight of GOD and Man, they are rea|dy to e&s;teem CHRIST <HI>a Mini&s;ter of Sin,</HI> and to reflect upon <HI>his Religion</HI> as allowing, or, at lea&s;t, not &s;uffici|ently di&s;countenancing Vice and Wickedne&s;s: Nor does any Thing more dreadfully prejudice Men again&s;t a religious Profe&s;&s;ion, and harden them in their Sins.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides not being vicious, <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> &s;hould be of <HI>a good Conver&s;ation in</HI> CHRIST. It is not enough that they keep them&s;elves innocent from great Tran&s;gre&s;&s;i|ons, that they are blamele&s;s, and without Rebuke, in the mid&s;t of a crooked and perver&s;e Generation; but they
<PB N="11" REF="005358_0009_10182241B22FD6E0">
mu&s;t expre&s;s a becoming Care to <HI>&s;hew them&s;elves Patterns of good Works; Examples</HI> to all they live among, <HI>in Word, in Conver&s;ation, in Faith, in Purity, in Charity.</HI> Such &s;hould be their Manner of Life as to be able to appeal to the People of their re&s;pective Charges, in the Language of the <HI>Apo&s;tles, Ye are Witne&s;&s;es, and GOD al&s;o, how holily, and ju&s;tly, and unblameably, we behaved our&s;elves among them that believe.</HI> This would exhibit a lovely Idea of Religion, and recommend it to the Choice and E&s;teem of the World, more than the be&s;t &s;tudied Sermons, while they &s;aw we paid little Regard to them our&s;elves.</P>
<P>But there are &s;ome <HI>&s;pecial</HI> In&s;tances of <HI>Behaviour,</HI> peculiarly befitting Mini&s;ters, and wherein they mu&s;t be <HI>exemplary,</HI> if they would take due heed to <HI>them|&s;elves.</HI> Thus,</P>
<P>They &s;hould behave with <HI>Humility;</HI> &s;etting before their View, the Example of the meek and lowly JESUS, their Ma&s;ter and Lord; who conde&s;cended to wa&s;h e|ven his Di&s;ciples Feet. They &s;hould not, becau&s;e they have the Advantage of &s;ome others in Point of <HI>Educati|ons, Gifts,</HI> and <HI>Station</HI> in the Church of GOD, grow big in their own Imagination, and treat tho&s;e below them with Neglect and Contempt. Nothing appears more un&s;eemly in tho&s;e who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s it is to <HI>preach up Hu|mility,</HI> than the Di&s;covery of a proud and haughty Spi|rit, a Temper to <HI>lord it over GOD's Heritage,</HI> and to carry it with Loftine&s;s, as though they might not be &s;poken to. But of all Pride in Mini&s;ters, none is &s;o odious as that which is <HI>&s;piritual.</HI> They never appear more di&s;agreeable, than while they are boa&s;ting of their own &s;uperior Sanctity, tru&s;ting in them&s;elves that they are righteous, and de&s;pi&s;ing others; e&s;pecially is this Vanity dete&s;table, when it &s;hows it&s;elf in Contempt of their <HI>Brethren</HI> in the <HI>Mini&s;try;</HI> when they are urged on by it to invade their Province, looking upon them|&s;elves as <HI>extraordinary</HI> Men, <HI>&s;pecial</HI> in&s;truments in the Con|ver&s;ion
<PB N="12" REF="005358_0010_10182244852E5310">
of Sinners&punc; while tho&s;e, into who&s;e Labours they enter, are e&s;teemed and treated by them (tho' perhaps much more valuable than them&s;elves in the Opinion of all &s;ober Judges) as poor carnal worthle&s;s Creatures, not fit to preach the Go&s;pel. How much better would it &s;ute the Character of tho&s;e who are the Mini&s;ters of the humble JESUS, if, with the great <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> they appeared to have an Opinion of them&s;elves as <HI>le&s;s than the lea&s;t of all Saints, and not meet to be called Mini&s;ters?</HI> If they preferred others in Love, e&s;teemed them better than them&s;elves, and treated them with a decent Re&s;pect? And they would &s;hine &s;till brighter, if, at all Times, they appear'd with an Air of Meek|ne&s;s and Conde&s;cen&s;ion, &s;hewing <HI>Humility</HI> to <HI>all,</HI> in their Speech, in their Carriage, in all the Exerci&s;es of their Office. This mode&s;t humble Deportment is <HI>graceful</HI> in <HI>any,</HI> but peculiarly recommending in Men of <HI>our Pro|fe&s;&s;ion.</HI> Scarce any Thing will rai&s;e us higher in the good Opinion of People; whereas, if we are lofty and proud, its much if we are reverenced by any but our &s;elves.</P>
<P>Mini&s;ters &s;hould behave al&s;o with <HI>Charity;</HI> di&s;cover|ing a Readine&s;s to all the Offices of Chri&s;tian Love and Kindne&s;s, both to Men's Souls and Bodies, their Character and U&s;efulne&s;s in the World: Nor &s;hould they confine the&s;e Exerci&s;es of their Good-will to their Friends and Acquaintance, tho&s;e who may think well of them and admire them. This would be to do no more than <HI>Publicans</HI> and <HI>Sinners.</HI> For they <HI>love tho&s;e that love them, &s;alute their Brethren,</HI> and treat their Friends with &s;ingu|lar Marks of Civility and Courte&s;ie. And &s;hall <HI>Chri&s;tian Mini&s;ters</HI> carry the Expre&s;&s;ions of their Charity no higher than this comes to? They ought to &s;hew their Benig|nity to Enemies, yea, the greate&s;t Enemies they have in the World; tho&s;e who mo&s;t injure and abu&s;e them. It &s;hould be vi&s;ible to all they Conver&s;e with, that they can put up Affronts, bear In&s;ults, forgive ill Treatment, yea, that they can <HI>do good to them that hate them,</HI> that
<PB N="13" REF="005358_0011_1018224616BB2EF0">
they can <HI>ble&s;s them that cur&s;e them,</HI> and <HI>pray for them that de&s;pitefully u&s;e and per&s;ecute them.</HI></P>
<P>And if they &s;hould exerci&s;e Charity in &s;uch high In|&s;tances, much more &s;hould they behave with Kindne&s;s to tho&s;e, who are no otherwi&s;e Enemies to them, than as they cannot think and &s;peak ju&s;t as they would have them. They &s;hould not <HI>judge</HI> &s;uch; they &s;hould not <HI>&s;et at nought</HI> &s;uch; for one is <HI>our Ma&s;ter in Heaven,</HI> and we <HI>mu&s;t all appear before the Judgment-&s;eat of</HI> CHRIST. They &s;hould not treat &s;uch with <HI>Bitterne&s;s,</HI> and <HI>Wrath,</HI> and <HI>Anger,</HI> and <HI>Clamour,</HI> and <HI>Evil-&s;peaking.</HI> This is not the <HI>Charity,</HI> any more than the Wi&s;dom, <HI>that is from above.</HI> The Charity of this Kind is <HI>peaceable, gentle, ea&s;y to be intreated, full of Mercy, and good Fruits, and without Partiality.</HI> It looks ill, e&s;pecially in <HI>Mini&s;ters,</HI> to call bad Names, to &s;it in Judgment upon their Fel|low-Chri&s;tians, and <HI>Fellow-Labourers</HI> in the Work of the Lord, to determine their State, and damn their Souls. It would be much more becoming, &s;hould they be <HI>Op|po&s;ers of the Truth, and taken in the Snare of the Devil, to in&s;truct them in Meekne&s;s.</HI> This might, through the Ble&s;&s;ing of GOD, bring them <HI>to Repentance, to the ac|knowledging of the Truth:</HI> But to <HI>rail</HI> at them will have no Tendency to enlighten their Minds, or alter their Judgments; though it may move their Re&s;entments, and fill them with Indignation.</P>
<P>In like Manner, Mini&s;ters &s;hould behave with <HI>Steadi|ne&s;s;</HI> making it apparent, that they are of <HI>fixt</HI> Princi|ples, and a <HI>uniform</HI> Conduct.

<P>In fine, Mini&s;ters &s;hould behave with <HI>Activity</HI> and <HI>Di|ligence.

We have a great deal of Work to do, as we are called to watch for the Souls of others, as well as our own; a great deal to do, not only in our <HI>Clo&s;ets</HI> and <HI>Studies,</HI> but in our <HI>private Applications,</HI> e&s;pe|cially to the <HI>Sick,</HI> tho&s;e that are <HI>gone a&s;tray,</HI> and tho&s;e who may be under <HI>&s;piritual Doubts</HI> and <HI>Troubles;</HI> and in our <HI>public</HI> Performances.

the Weak and Ignorant; but 'tis perfectly ta&s;tele&s;s to the Wi&s;e and Judicious, who, on this Account, will ju&s;tly conceive a low Opinion of us. How much more would it redound to our Honour, if we &s;o performed the Duties of our Station, as that it &s;hould be apparent to all, that our Heart was in our Bu&s;ine&s;s, that it &s;wallowed up our whole Time, and employed all our Tho'ts and Powers?

<P N="2">2. <HI>Second</HI> Branch of the Duty of Mini&s;ters, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> their <HI>taking heed to their Doctrine.</HI> And they mu&s;t take heed to it, that it be <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> in Oppo&s;ition to that which is the Re&s;ult of <HI>meer Rea&s;on;</HI> that it be <HI>&s;ound,</HI> in Oppo&s;iti|on to that which is <HI>corrupt;</HI> that it be <HI>important,</HI> in Op|po&s;ition to that which is <HI>trifling;</HI> and, in fine, that it be <HI>real,</HI> in Oppo&s;ition to that which is <HI>imaginary.</HI> We &s;hall be di&s;tinct and particular here. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. Mini&s;ters &s;hould take heed to their <HI>Doctrine,</HI> that it be <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> and not <HI>meerly rational.</HI></P>
<P>I would not, by this, be under&s;tood to find Fault with a <HI>rational</HI> Way of preaching. This was <HI>Paul'</HI>s <HI>Manner,</HI> that eminent Pattern of good preaching. Hence that Remark in his Story, Acts 17. 2. <HI>And</HI> Paul, <HI>as</HI> HIS MAN|NER WAS, <HI>went in unto them, and three Sabbath-Days</HI> REASONED <HI>with them out of the Scriptures.</HI> And the like ob&s;ervable Remark we have, in the next Chapter v. 4. <HI>And he</HI> REASONED <HI>in the Synagogue every Sabbath, and per&s;uaded the Jews, and the Greeks.</HI> And 'tis a Way of preaching that ought not to be &s;poken again&s;t. 'Tis the Way in which Men, who are <HI>rea&s;onable</HI> Creatures, ought to be addre&s;t to: Nor are they treated as Men, if all pro|per Care is not taken to inform their Judgments, and fill their Minds with the Knowledge of GOD's Will in all, &s;piritual Wi&s;dom and Under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>Neither would I be under&s;tood to &s;ugge&s;t, as if <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> had nothing to do in Matters of <HI>Revelation.</HI> So far is
<PB N="17" REF="005358_0015_10182253B66A5BE0">
this from the Truth, that without <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> we could never know the <HI>Meaning</HI> of a Revelation from GOD, or prove it to be one. And 'tis the peculiar Glory of the great and main Points of <HI>revealed</HI> Religion, that they are per|fectly con&s;i&s;tent with <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> tho' they could not have been inve&s;tigated by it: Nor does a Preacher do more Honor to <HI>Revelation,</HI> than while he di&s;cour&s;es upon the &s;everal Articles of it in a Way of <HI>Rea&s;oning</HI> and <HI>Argu|ment;</HI> repre&s;enting them worthy of GOD, and fit to be embraced by Men, though they &s;hould, &s;ome of them, be beyond human Comprehen&s;ion. And indeed <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> are no &s;uch Enemies as &s;ome may be ready to imagine. There is no Doctrine of <HI>Faith,</HI> but it per|fectly accords with the Principles of <HI>true Rea&s;on:</HI> Nor otherwi&s;e might it be received as an Article of <HI>Faith.</HI> We &s;hould never therefore oppo&s;e <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Rea&s;on;</HI> but rather con&s;ider them as Helps and Supports to each other; for &s;o they really are: Nor can there be <HI>Faith</HI> without <HI>Rea&s;on.</HI> To be &s;ure, it would gro&s;ly reflect upon <HI>Faith,</HI> if in Order to our being <HI>Believers,</HI> we mu&s;t renounce our <HI>Rea&s;on;</HI> for this would be to put off our Character as <HI>Men.</HI></P>
<P>But though <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> may, and ought to be employed by <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> in <HI>preaching,</HI> yet the <HI>Doctrine</HI> they preach &s;hould not be the Re&s;ult of <HI>meer human Rea&s;on.</HI> It would be highly incongruous, and ju&s;tly offen&s;ive, in a Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel, to di&s;cour&s;e to his Hearers, as though he had no Knowledge of, or Regard to, the Re|velation GOD has made of him&s;elf by his SON JESUS CHRIST. He &s;hould ever appear to be a <HI>Mini&s;ter</HI> of CHRIST by the <HI>Doctrine</HI> he preaches. This &s;hould be truly <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> as being fetch'd from the <HI>Go&s;pel.</HI> His preaching &s;hould not be in <HI>Words of Man's Wi&s;dom,</HI> but the <HI>Truth as it is in</HI> JESUS. He may properly enough, upon &s;ome Occa&s;ions, &s;peak of tho&s;e Things, which might have been known, by the due Exerci&s;e of <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> without <HI>Revelation;</HI> but he &s;hould not confine him&s;elf, in treating even upon the&s;e Things, to <HI>meer Rea&s;on;</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="005358_0016_10182256C6B573F8">
but &s;hould make U&s;e of the Light that is reflected on them from the <HI>Scripture,</HI> and take Care to con&s;ider them in the Reference they bear to CHRIST. Nor &s;hould he be a&s;hamed to in&s;i&s;t much in his Preaching, upon the <HI>My&s;teries</HI> which were <HI>hid from Ages and Generations,</HI> but have been <HI>made manife&s;t in the&s;e la&s;t Days,</HI> by the appear|ing of the SON of GOD in our Nature.

With PHILIP, he &s;hould <HI>preach the Things concerning the King|dom of GOD, and the Name of</HI> JESUS CHHIST: Yea, with the Apo&s;tle PAUL, he &s;hould <HI>determine not to know any Thing</HI> among his People, <HI>&s;ave</HI> JESUS CHRIST, <HI>and him crucified.</HI> And the more of CHRIST, not his <HI>meer Name,</HI> but the <HI>Spirit</HI> and <HI>Genius</HI> of <HI>his Religion,</HI> he di&s;covers in his Preaching, the more worthy will he be of the Cha|racter of an able Mini&s;ter of the New-Te&s;tament.</P>
<P N="2">2. Mini&s;ters &s;hould take heed to their <HI>Doctrine,</HI> that it be <HI>&s;ound,</HI> in Oppo&s;ition to that which is <HI>fal&s;e</HI> and <HI>erro|neous.</HI> It &s;hould be the <HI>pure, uncorrupted Word</HI> of GOD.

of their People <HI>in Verity; Nouri&s;hers</HI> of them <HI>in Faith and good Doctrine.</HI> They &s;hould deliver nothing but the Truth, and &s;hould do it, as much as may be, without the Mixture of any Thing <HI>erroneous:</HI> And they &s;hould be particularly cautious upon this Head, at a Time, when People <HI>will not endure &s;ound Doctrine, but, after their own Lu&s;ts, heap to them&s;elves Teachers, having itch|ing Ears.</HI></P>
<P>Would the Time permit, I might here properly take Occa&s;ion to enumerate &s;ome of tho&s;e <HI>Errors,</HI> which, if Mini&s;ters &s;hould countenance in their Preaching, they would not <HI>take heed to their Doctrine,</HI> that it be <HI>&s;ound.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e <HI>Errors</HI> is, that which makes <HI>A&s;&s;u|rance</HI> e&s;&s;ential to a Man's being a true Believer in CHRIST. The <HI>Bible</HI> knows of no &s;uch Doctrine as this. It tea|ches, it is true, that A&s;&s;urance is attainable; that it is the Duty of Chri&s;tians to give Diligence to make their Calling and Election &s;ure; and that it is a bad Sign when Men are ea&s;y and contented, while uncertain whe|ther they are intere&s;ted in the &s;aving Mercy of GOD, through the LORD JESUS CHRIST. But it no where &s;ays, that a Man cannot be a <HI>real</HI> Chri&s;tian, if under Doubts and Difficulties re&s;pecting his <HI>&s;piritual</HI> State: So far from it, that it expre&s;ly declares a Man may truly <HI>fear and obey GOD,</HI> and yet <HI>walk in Darkne&s;s;</HI> Yea, in Darkne&s;s to &s;o great a Degree as to <HI>&s;ee no Light;</HI> I&s;ai. 50. 10. It is therefore a corrupting the Truth to tell People, that <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>A&s;&s;urance</HI> are <HI>in&s;eparably connected,</HI> and that there cannot be the former without the latter. And tho&s;e, who deliver &s;uch Doctrine as this, ju&s;tly <HI>offend the Generation of GOD's Children,</HI> who, in all Ages, have experienced the Rever&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>That</HI> al&s;o is an <HI>Error</HI> which makes the <HI>Knowledge</HI> of the <HI>Time</HI> and <HI>Manner</HI> of Conver&s;ion nece&s;&s;ary to the Thing it &s;elf. This is a Doctrine the <HI>Scripture</HI> is an in|tire Stranger to: Nor will it accord with the Experience
<PB N="20" REF="005358_0018_1018225D18A36F20">
of a great many as good Chri&s;tians as any we know of in the World. Conver&s;ion, it is true, is &s;ometimes ef|fected in a Manner &s;o ob&s;ervable, that the <HI>Time.</HI> and <HI>Circum&s;tances,</HI> may be particularly pointed out: But 'tis not always thus, nor, it may be, mo&s;t frequently. There is a va&s;t Variety in the Dealing of GOD, with different Per&s;ons, in bringing them into a State of Grace, both as to <HI>Time</HI> and <HI>Manner,</HI> as well as <HI>Degree,</HI> yea, and eve|ry other <HI>Circum&s;tance</HI> relative thereto. So that if &s;ome can tell <HI>when</HI> and <HI>how</HI> they were converted, it is no Ar|gument others mu&s;t be able to do the like, tho' equally in a good State. A <HI>real, thorow</HI> Conver&s;ion from Sin to GOD in CHRIST, is <HI>nece&s;&s;ary;</HI> and to affirm it to be &s;o is <HI>&s;ound</HI> Doctrine: but to &s;ay that we can't be con|verted, unle&s;s we know the <HI>preci&s;e Time</HI> when this Change was wrought, is <HI>corrupt</HI> and <HI>fal&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>In like Manner, 'tis gro&s;ly <HI>erroneous</HI> to pretend, as if <HI>unregenerate</HI> Men ought not to <HI>pray;</HI> and there needs no other Proof of it than only this, that GOD has plainly commanded them to <HI>pray.</HI> Tho&s;e Per&s;ons are certainly <HI>unregenerate,</HI> who want a <HI>new Heart to be given to them,</HI> and a <HI>new &s;pirit to be put within them;</HI> and yet, that is the Language of GOD to Per&s;ons of <HI>this Character,</HI> and in Order to their Obtainment of a <HI>new Heart,</HI> and a <HI>new Spirit,</HI> Ezek. 36. 37. <HI>I will for this be enquired of by the Hou&s;e of I&s;rael, to do it for them.</HI> And what if <HI>unconverted</HI> Men cannot pray in the &s;ame <HI>gracious</HI> Man|ner with tho&s;e, who have been <HI>transformed by the renew|ing of the</HI> HOLY GHOST? Did not GOD know this before the Appointment of Prayer: And han't he, not|with&s;tanding, revealed it as his <HI>Mind</HI> that <HI>they</HI> &s;hould pray? Yea, that they &s;hould attend this Duty, as an <HI>In&s;titution</HI> of his, in the U&s;e of which they may humbly hope for <HI>converting</HI> Grace? For any therefore to in&s;inuate, as if <HI>unconverted</HI> Men would not do well to lay open their di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Ca&s;e before the Father of Mercies, by Prayer and Supplication, with Confe&s;&s;ion, is not only, in Rea|lity of Con&s;equence, to arraign the <HI>Wi&s;dom of GOD's

<P>In fine, for I mu&s;t not &s;tay to multiply Particulars 'Tis an <HI>Error,</HI> and a very <HI>dangerous</HI> one too, &s;o to mi&s;|take the <HI>U&s;e</HI> and <HI>De&s;ign</HI> of the <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s of</HI> CHRIST, as to &s;uppo&s;e it takes away <HI>all Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of any <HI>Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s of our own.</HI> Some, not having a clear and di&s;|tinct Notion of the Go&s;pel <HI>U&s;e</HI> and <HI>De&s;ign</HI> of CHRIST'S <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> and of <HI>our own,</HI> have &s;poken of the&s;e Things &s;o as to reflect Di&s;honor on CHRIST, while they might intend to exalt him. The U&s;e of <HI>our own Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> in the <HI>Go&s;pel-plan</HI> is not to entitle us to Salvation, there is no <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of it for this; nor is it &s;ufficient to an&s;wer &s;uch a Purpo&s;e. When we have done our be&s;t, we are unprofitable Servanrs, as having fallen &s;hort of our Duty: And therefore it cannot be by any <HI>Works of Righteou&s;ne&s;s which we have done,</HI> that we are <HI>ju&s;tified</HI> and <HI>&s;aved;</HI> but for the Sake of CHRIST, in Con|&s;ideration of what he <HI>did</HI> and <HI>&s;uffered,</HI> when he &s;tood in the Place of Sinners. This therefore is the <HI>U&s;e</HI> of the <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s of</HI> CHRIST: 'Tis our <HI>Title</HI> to Heaven, <HI>that</HI> on the Account of which we are intere&s;ted in the Mer|cy of GOD to eternal Life.

<P>Some, perhaps, may think this a needle&s;s Caution: But if they do, it is becau&s;e they are ignorant of the World, yea, and of their <HI>Bibles</HI> too.

Hence that Pa&s;&s;age directed to the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Nation, Jer. 23. 16. <HI>Thus &s;aith the</HI> LORD <HI>of Ho&s;ts, hearken not unto the Words of the Prophets that prophe&s;ie unto you: they make you vain; they &s;peak a Vi&s;ion of their own Heart, and not out of the Mouth of the</HI> LORD.

Mini&s;ters then &s;hould <HI>take heed to their Doctrine,</HI> that it be the <HI>real</HI> Truth of GOD, and not dare utter any Thing, as coming from him, but what they can prove does &s;o.

It is by the Ordinance of preaching, that it plea&s;es GOD to &s;ave them that believe. This is the wi&s;e Appoint|ment of Heaven to bring about this Purpo&s;e of Divine Mercy.

Who planteth a Vineyard, and eateth not of the Fruit thereof? Or, who feedeth a Flock, and eateth not of the Milk of the Flock? Say I the&s;e Things as a Man? Or &s;aith not the Law the &s;ame al&s;o? And you will, doubtle&s;s, find your Account in well &s;upporting your <HI>Pa&s;tor.</HI> He will, by this Means, be able to make better Provi&s;ion for your Souls. And what <HI>&s;aith the</HI> LORD <HI>of Ho&s;ts? Prove me now herewith, if I will not pour you out a Ble&s;&s;ing.</HI>&mdash;And as you have &s;elected him from others to be your <HI>Pa&s;tor,</HI> let him have the Preference in your Affecti|ons. Don't &s;uffer any <HI>wandring Stranger</HI> to alienate your Hearts from him: This, in the End, will be unprofitable for you: But cheri&s;h an inward real Regard to him. Honour him in the LORD, and e&s;|teem him very highly for his Work's Sake.&mdash;Don't be &s;hy to make him acquainted with your <HI>&s;piritual</HI> Trials and Difficulties. Don't go to <HI>others</HI> to the Neglect, or rather Contempt of him; as though he

had not Skill in &s;uch Matters, or would not lay him|&s;elf out, in all proper Ways, to &s;ute and &s;erve you. This has been a Fault too common in the&s;e Times: And it has too much tended to <HI>that glorying in Men,</HI> which an in&s;pir'd <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> has cautioned again&s;t.&mdash;Don't be offended, if he deals plainly and faithfully with you; telling you of your Sins, and reproving you for them. He would be greatly wanting in his Duty, if he &s;hould &s;uffer Sin upon you. He is di|rected of GOD to <HI>reprove</HI> and <HI>rebuke,</HI> as well as ex|hort, with all Long &s;uffering.&mdash;Don't think it &s;trange if you &s;hould di&s;cern in him Frailties and Imperfections. This is no more than may be expected, con&s;idering he is a <HI>Man of like Pa&s;&s;ions with your&s;elves.</HI> You &s;hould therefore cover his Infirmities with the Mantle of Charity, and ever be in a Di&s;po&s;ition, not to aggra|vate his Failings, but to make all kind Allowances, exerci&s;ing Love and Candour towards him.&mdash;And let me <HI>be&s;eech you, Brethren, for the LORD JESUS CHRIST's Sake, and for the Love of the SPIRIT, to &s;trive in your Prayers to GOD for him.</HI> Make Mention of him without cea&s;ing in your <HI>Families</HI> and <HI>Clo&s;ets,</HI> that he may be a rich Ble&s;&s;ing to <HI>your &s;elves,</HI> and to <HI>your Children.</HI>&mdash;Above all, let your profit|ing, under his Mini&s;try, appear to all around you. Think it not enough, that the Go&s;pel by him is preached to you. This <HI>alone</HI> won't be &s;ufficient. It mu&s;t have its <HI>proper Influence,</HI> both on your <HI>Hearts</HI> and <HI>Lives;</HI> on your <HI>Hearts,</HI> conforming them to the <HI>Image</HI> of the ble&s;&s;ed GOD, and his Son JESUS CHRIST; and on your <HI>Lives,</HI> making them &s;uch, in all Sobriety, Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and Godline&s;s, as the Go&s;pel requires: In order thereto, let your Minds be open to In&s;truction.&mdash;Be ready to embrace the Truth in the Love of it.&mdash;Receive the Word with Meekne&s;s and Faith, and be ever willing to yield Obedience to it: So will you <HI>honour</HI> your <HI>Profe&s;&s;ion,</HI> and be the <HI>Glory</HI> of your <HI>Pa&s;tor;</HI> his

<HI>Joy</HI> here, and <HI>Crown</HI> in the <HI>Day</HI> of the <HI>Manife&s;|tation</HI> of the SON of GOD.</P>
<P>I cannot break off without lamenting the unhap|py Di&s;&s;en&s;ion there has been in this Town, where|by the Redeemer has been di&s;honored, Religion wounded, and Satan gratified. Who have been the blameable Cau&s;es, is not for me to &s;ay; nor what might have prevented it.&mdash;We heartily wi&s;h a Ble&s;&s;ing out of the Hou&s;e of the LORD to the <HI>other Church</HI> and <HI>Pa&s;tor. Grace, Mercy, and Peace, be mul|tiplied to them from the GOD and FATHER of our LORD JESUS CHRIST!</HI> And wherein any, on either Part, have &s;aid, or done any Thing ami&s;s, the good LORD pardon them for his Mercies Sake in JESUS CHRIST!</P>
<P>And may the <HI>GOD of Love and Peace</HI> unite <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> and <HI>Churches</HI> in this Day of Contention! And may we all finally have Admi&s;&s;ion granted to us into that coming Kingdom of GOD, where no Offence &s;hall be given, or taken; where there &s;hall be no Variance or Strife, but Love and Charity in Perfection forever! Till which ble&s;&s;ed Time, let us encourage our &s;elves to hope for the Fulfillment of that <HI>Prayer</HI> of our SAVIOUR for the Profe&s;&s;ors of his Religion, John 17. 21. <HI>That they all may be</HI> ONE, AS THOU FATHER ART IN ME, AND I IN THEE; <HI>that they al&s;o may be</HI> ONE IN US: <HI>That the World may believe that thou ha&s;t &s;ent me.</HI></P>
