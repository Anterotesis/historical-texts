<HEAD><HI>DOCTRINE.</HI> THERE are Vain Thoughts in the Hearts of Sinners which are Great Hindrances of their being Saved.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Vain Thoughts</HI> here intended, are the common cau&s;e of vain confidence, carnal &s;ecuri|ty and fal&s;e hopes, which prove the ruin of Mul|titudes under the Go&s;pel. A de&s;ire of Happine&s;s is natural to every Man. Neverthele&s;s, the gene|rality of Chri&s;tians do finally mi&s;s of Happine&s;s. And if we make diligent &s;earch we &s;hall find that &s;ome <HI>Vain Thought,</HI> or other, is the great cau&s;e thereof. Their <HI>Vain Thoughts</HI> do fru&s;trate and de|feat their de&s;ires, and render them altogether in|effectual to Salvation. It may then be exceeding u&s;eful to point out the&s;e <HI>Vain Thoughts</HI> and &s;how how greatly they do hinder our Salvation; and al&s;o di&s;cover the Vanity of them, that &s;o we may no longer &s;uffer them to lodge in our hearts. The heart of Man is &s;o great a deep, &s;o deceitful and de&s;perately Wicked that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to enu|merate all tho&s;e <HI>Vain Thoughts</HI> which dwell therein. Yet from the Word of GOD (which gives the cleare&s;t di&s;covery of Man's heart, and in &s;o doing evidences its Divine Original) we may come to the Knowledge of a great many of the&s;e <HI>Vain Thoughts.</HI> I &s;hall &s;et &s;ome of them before you under the&s;e following Heads, with all po&s;&s;ible plainne&s;s.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>THERE are Vain Thoughts in the hearts of Sinners</HI> concerning <HI>GOD, which are great hindran|ces of their being Saved.</HI> Sinners oftentimes form &s;uch vain Conceptions of GOD in their Minds as

prove ruinous to their Souls. They imagine GOD to be &s;uch a one as He really is not. And the&s;e fal&s;e imaginations do greatly tend to their De&s;truction. To In&s;tance here,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>IT is a Vain Thought, That GOD is ignoran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of any of the Sins of Men.</HI> Such a Thought as thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> there is oftentimes in the Hearts of Sinners.

He is not only there; but al&s;o every where el&s;e, &s;o as that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to find any place from whence GOD is excluded, P&s;al. 139.7, 8, 9. <HI>Whither &s;hall I free from thy pre&s;ence? If I a&s;cend up into Heaven, thou art there; if I make my bed in Hell, behold thou art there. If I take the Wings of the Morning, and dwell in the uttermo&s;t parts of the Sea; even there &s;hall thy hand lead me, and thy Right hand &s;hall hold me.</HI> Let us go where we will, GOD is there; and therefore the mo&s;t &s;e|cret place cannot conceal us from GOD. Jer. 23.24. <HI>Can any Man hide him&s;elf in &s;ecret places, that I &s;hall not &s;ee him? &s;aith the Lord. Do I n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Heaven and Earth? &s;aith the Lord</HI> What can an Omnipre&s;ent GOD be a Stranger to? What Sin can be hid from Him.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>GOD is One of Infinite Under&s;tanding, and there|fore knows every thing.</HI> The Under&s;tanding of GOD has no bounds of Perfection; but is Infinitely Perfect, P&s;al. 147.5. <HI>His Under&s;tanding is Infinite.</HI> There are no limits can be &s;et to it. And con|&s;equently there can be nothing excluded from His Knowledge. If there were any thing which GOD did not know, His Knowledge would be imperfect, and defective and finite. 'Tis certain then that GOD knows all things that are done by Men He &s;ees and knows what ever they do in the darke&s;t rece&s;&s;es and retirements. P&s;al 139.11, 12. <HI>If I &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y &s;urely the darkne&s;s &s;hall cover me, even the Night &s;hall be light about me.

<PB N="6" REF="002302_0005_0FDB1C84A7AA82B0">
are yet perfectly known by the Great GOD. 1 King. 8.39. <HI>For thou, even thou only, knowe&s;t the hearts of all the Children of Men.</HI> There is not &s;o much as a <HI>Thought</HI> in the heart, but GOD know|eth it. P&s;al. 139.2. <HI>Thou under&s;tandest my thought afar off.</HI> In &s;hort, <HI>All the ways of Man are before the eyes of the Lord; and he pondereth all his goings,</HI> Prov. 5.21, Job 34.21. <HI>There is no Creature that is not manife&s;t in his &s;ight; but all things are naked, and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do,</HI> Heb. 4.13. What Sin then is it that GOD does not know?</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>GOD will Judge the World in Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> mu&s;t know all the Sins of Men.</HI> GOD has appointed a Day wherein He will Judge all Men: And the Judge of the whole Earth will in that Day do Right, Gen. 18.25. <HI>He will then render to every man according to his deeds,</HI> Rom. 2.6. The Reward &s;hall be according to what the na|ture and quality of their works have been. 2 Cor. 5.10. <HI>For we mu&s;t all appear before the Judgment &s;eat of Christ, that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.</HI> Tho&s;e that have done well, &s;hall be well-rewarded, and tho&s;e that have done ill, &s;hall be ill-rewarded, and both of them proportionable to the good or evil they have done. Now GOD cannot thus exactly recompence Men, unle&s;s He have a full, perfect and di&s;tinct knowledge of their Deeds. As &s;ure then as GOD is a ju&s;t Judge, &s;o &s;ure is it that He knows all the Sins of Men, even tho&s;e that are the mo&s;t &s;ecret: And accordingly we are informed that GOD in the la&s;t and great Day, will &s;et the Sins of Men in order before their eyes. Eccl. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> 14. <HI>God &s;hall bring every work
<PB N="7" REF="002302_0005_0FDB1C84A7AA82B0">
into Judgment, with every &s;ecret thing, whether it be good or evil.</HI> In that Day the mo&s;t concealed ini|quities of Men &s;hall be laid open to the view of the whole World. 1 Cor. 4.5. <HI>Therefore Judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who will bring to light the hidden things of darkne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>FROM the&s;e things then it is evident, That the thought of GOD's being ignorant of any of the Sins of Men, is a <HI>Vain Thought</HI>; a Thought that has no Truth in it; no real foundation for it, and that will deceive us if we promi&s;e our &s;elves any advantage from it. Well then, let not &s;uch a <HI>Vain Thought</HI> as this lodge is our hearts; but let us keep up the contrary Thought in our hearts. Let us for ever keep it in the imagination of the Thought of our hearts, that GOD &s;eeth all our ways, and counteth all our &s;teps. That His eyes are in every place beholding the Evil and the Good. That if we do evil at any time, in the mo&s;t retired Apartment, yet we do it in the &s;ight of GOD. Such a Thought at this lodging in our hearts, would be a Thought of exceeding great Service and Advantage to us. This would help to make us watchful and circum&s;pect; to pre|vent a great many Sins which we may be tempted unto. The &s;etting the Lord always before us, is one of the greate&s;t pre&s;ervatives from Sin, e&s;pecially from &s;ecret Sins: It is al&s;o a good Sign of an heart that is upright with GOD; for none but &s;uch have GOD much in their eye. So much for the fir&s;t <HI>Vain thought</HI> concerning GOD.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>IT is a</HI> Vain Thought. <HI>That GOD is &s;o Mer|ciful as not to destroy Men for their Sins.</HI> Sometimes
<PB N="8" REF="002302_0006_0FDB1C894BD56370">
Men have in their hearts &s;uch a Thought con|cerning GOD as this is: They imagine Him to be &s;uch a merciful GOD as they would have Him to be; a GOD all made op of Mercy, that wont take vengeance for Sin. Are not Per&s;ons &s;ometimes heard to &s;ay? <HI>That GOD is more Merci|ful than to damn His Creatures.</HI> And is there not the &s;ame &s;ecret imagination in the hearts of multi|tudes of Sinners? They take up &s;uch a motion of Divine Mercy, as if it would &s;uffer none to Peri&s;h in a mi&s;erable De&s;truction. They magni|fy and extol the Mercy of GOD; and &s;et it forth to them&s;elves as a perfection that will infallibly &s;ecure them from Damnation. When they would flatter them&s;elves, then they cry up the Infinite|ne&s;s of Divine Mercy. Now &s;uch a thought as this is a great hindrance of Mens being Saved. This tends to make them go on &s;ecurely in Sin, and be fearle&s;s of Damnation: This makes them to think that they may lead wicked lives, and yet that all &s;hall be well at the la&s;t: That Mer|cy will prevent their Damnation, and &s;ecure their Salvation. This thought is a <HI>Vain Thought</HI>; a thought which won't an&s;wer our expectations nor afford us that &s;afety which we promi&s;e to our&s;elves.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>THE Vanity of this Thought may be &s;ees under the&s;e following Heads,</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. <HI>IT is granted that GOD is a mo&s;t merciful GOD.</HI> Thus far the Thought of Sinners is Right; and it is their Duty to entertain &s;uch a thought of GOD in their hearts. We are to believe that GOD is <HI>abundant in Mercy,</HI> for &s;o He hath revealed Him&s;elf unto us to be. P&s;al 86.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. <HI>Thou, O
<PB N="9" REF="002302_0006_0FDB1C894BD56370">
Lord, art a God full of compa&s;&s;ion and gracious, long-&s;uffering ann plentious in Mercy.</HI> This Attribute of Divine Mercy lay hid in GOD until after the A|po&s;tacy of Men. Then GOD gave a Glorious di&s;covery of it in the Fir&s;t Promi&s;e of the Seed of the Woman. And afterwards GOD more ful|ly and di&s;tinctly revealed the exceeding greatne&s;s of His Mercy, <HI>Exod.</HI> 34.6, 7. The Glory of it &s;hines forth throughout the Holy Scriptures, where|in in it is declared to be Infinite and Incomprehen|&s;ible. We cannot then form in our Minds <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oo great an Idea of it, nor entertain too High &amp; Ho|nourable Thoughts of it. 'Tis a vile reflection upon the Mercy of GOD, to have low and mean Conceptions of it. This is one thing which makes the Sin of De&s;pair to be &s;o great a Sin. It di&s;be|lieves the Infinitene&s;s of Divine Mercy, looking upon Sin greater than can be forgiven. As if the Sin of Man Exceeded the Mercy of GOD.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>THO' GOD be mo&s;t Merciful, yet He is &s;o only to the Repenting Sinner.</HI> Sinners in general are not the Objects of Divine Mercy. GOD does not &s;hew Mercy to all Sinners; but only to &s;uch to whom He has promi&s;ed to &s;hew Mercy. Now GOD's Promi&s;es of Mercy are made only to Pe|nitent Sinners. Prov. 28.13. <HI>Who&s;o confe&s;&s;eth and for&s;aketh Sin, &s;hall find Mercy.</HI> I&s;a. 55.7. <HI>Let the wicked for&s;ake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him return to the Lord, and be will have Mercy upon him.</HI> Repentance is made the con|dition of finding Mercy, and obtaining Forgivene&s;s. If Sinners perform this condition, they may be confident of Mercy; but if they fail of Repent|ing, they will a&s;&s;uredly mi&s;s of Mercy. Pardon|ing

<P N="3">3. <HI>DIVINE Mercy will be &s;o far from &s;aving im|penitent Sinners, as tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t will make their Damnation the greater.</HI> Tho' Sinners promi&s;e them&s;elves that GOD's Mercy will be for them, yet they will find it will be again&s;t them; it will be &s;o far from &s;tanding up for them as a Friend, that it will be turned to be their Enemy. It will be &s;o far from exempting them from Puni&s;hment, that it will bring upon them the fore&s;t of Puni&s;hments. This will be evident if we con&s;ider this one thing, <HI>viz</HI> While Sinners continue in Sin, thinking that Divine Mercy will &s;ave them notwith&s;tanding, they are Guilty of the vile&s;t abu&s;e of the Mercy of GOD: For hereby they make the Mercy of GOD an Encouragement to Sin; and look upon it as that which will afford them protection in their wicked ways. Now is not this a mo&s;t hor|rid Reflection upon the Mercy of GOD, to &s;up|po&s;e that it will &s;hield Men from Ju&s;tice, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> they per&s;i&s;t in wickedne&s;s?

<HEAD>THUS much for the <HI>Vain Thoughts</HI> of Sinners concerning GOD.</HEAD>
<P N="2">2. <HI>THERE are</HI> Vain Thoughts <HI>in the hearts of Sinners concerning the</HI> Providence of GOD, <HI>which are great hindrances of their being Saved.</HI> GOD who made all things, does exerci&s;e a Providence over them all. He unholds, governs and di&s;po&s;es of all Creatures. Now Sinners, tho' they may not deny the Providence of GOD; yet they entertain <HI>Vain Thoughts</HI> concerning &s;ome acts of Divine Pro|vidence, which do much hinder and endanger their Salvation. I &s;hall here In&s;tance only in two of them.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>IT is a Vain Thought, That becau&s;e GOD in His Providence, exerci&s;es Patience towards Sinners, there|fore He will never puni&s;h them for their Sins.</HI> It is the u&s;ual way of GOD to be patient towards Sinners: He does not pre&s;ently puni&s;h them; nay, oftentimes &s;uffers them to go a long time unpuni&s;hed. He not only exerci&s;es Forbearance towards them, but al&s;o long-&s;uffering, <HI>Rom.</HI> 2.4. Now, Sinners hereupon are apt to think that they &s;hall always go unpuni&s;hed. They inter|pret the Patience of GOD as an evidence of per|petual impunity. Becau&s;e GOD &s;u&s;pends the in|fliction of Puni&s;hment, they conclude He will totally exempt them from Puni&s;hment. Yea, They are apt to think, that He is not offended at their Sins; but rather likes well enough of them, as they do them&s;elves. P&s;al. 50.21. <HI>The&s;e things <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;t the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> done&punc; and I kept &s;ilence. i.e.</HI> I was provi|dentially

Divine Patience yields no ground for &s;uch an imagination. The Vanity of this Thought may be &s;een from what follows.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>THE primary Intention of GOD in everla&s;ting Patience towards Sinners, is that they might Repent&punc;</HI> While GOD is Patient, He expects that Sinner<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;hould prove them&s;elves Penitent.

If He be&s;tows upon them Riches and Honours, and Health beyond what He does to others, they &s;uppo&s;e them&s;elves to be the peculiar favourites of GOD. Surely, think they, If GOD had not a &s;ingular favour for us, He would not &s;o &s;mile upon us in His Providence. Such a Thought as this is a great Hindrance to Men's Salvation; for it tends to make Men &s;ecure in Sin, and &s;o re&s;t &s;atisfyed with their pre&s;ent Spi|ritual Condition, tho' it be not good.

and &s;o does not exact perfect Obedience from them, in their own Per&s;ons, as the condition of Eternal Life.

They are called upon to lead Holy, Righteous, Sober Lives; to be full of Good Works. Now, nothing is Holy, Ju&s;t and Good, but what is conformed to the Holy, Ju&s;t and Good Law of GOD. The Law then is a Rule to them which they &s;hould be careful to ob&s;erve in all things.

<P N="4">4. <HI>IT is a</HI> Vain Thought, <HI>That Repentance is no Go&s;pel Duty.</HI> This is the mo&s;t Vain and wor&s;t Thought of all, and yet a Thought by &s;ome entertained; they call Repentance a Legal Duty, and the Preaching of it Legal Preaching, they think that a Child of GOD ought not to be troubled for his Sins; and that it does not be|come a Go&s;pel-Spirit to grieve and &s;orrow for Mi&s;carriages. They &s;ay, that GOD beholds no Iniquity in <HI>Jacob,</HI> takes no notice of them, as having from Eternity Pardoned them; and there|fore they ought not to Mourn for them: Thus &s;peaks the abominable Antinomian. Such a Thought as this is mo&s;t pernicious, as it makes Men &s;ecure and quiet in Sin and Impenitency. The Vanity of this Thought is &s;o obvious as that little needs be &s;aid to Evidence it.</P>
<P>Yet,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>NOTHING is more clearly revealed in the Go&s;pel to be a Duty, than that of Repentance.</HI> 'Tis altogether needle&s;s to produce the Multiplied Commands to Repent. It may &s;uffice only to &s;ay that Repentance was con&s;tantly pre&s;&s;ed by Je&s;us Chri&s;t the Author of the Go&s;pel In His Publick Mini&s;try he made it one of the chief Sub|jects

which He in&s;i&s;ted upon, as being that which He was e&s;pecially &s;ent to call Sinners unto, Math. 9.13. <HI>I am not come to call the Righ|teous but Sinners to Repentance</HI>: And it is Recor|ded of Him, that this was His Practice; Mat. 4.17. <HI>At that time Je&s;us began to Preach and to &s;ay, Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.</HI> Mark 1.14, 15. <HI>Je&s;us came into Galilee, Preaching the Go&s;pel of the Kingdom of God, &s;aying, Repent ye, and believe the Go&s;pel.</HI> Now &s;urely Je&s;us Chri&s;t was a Go&s;pel Preacher, and Preached Repentance as an Evangelical Duty; and not only did He thus Him&s;elf; but likewi&s;e Commanded His Apo&s;tle to Preach the &s;ame Doctrine of Repen|tance, Luke 24.46, 47. <HI>He &s;aid unto them, &mdash; That Repentance and Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins &s;hould be Prea|ched in his name, among all Nations.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THUS much for the Fifth &s;ort of <HI>Vain Thoughts,</HI> viz. tho&s;e concerning <HI>Repentance.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="6">6. <HI>THERE are</HI> Vain Thoughts <HI>in the Hearts of Sinners concerning</HI> Obedience, <HI>which are great Hindrances of their being Saved.</HI> Sinners do many times take up wrong notions of true Obedience. They think they do indeed Obey GOD, when they do not; and thus falling &s;hort in their Obedience, they do mi&s;s of Salvation. Some of their <HI>Vain Thoughts</HI> in this Ca&s;e may be mentioned.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>IT is a</HI> Vain Thought, <HI>That Partial Obedience to the Commandments of GOD is true Obedience.</HI> If Men Obey GOD in &s;ome things, in many things, they think they Obey Him acceptably, though they don't Obey Him in all things. Thus Men &s;ometimes are &s;eemingly careful and exact in ob&s;erving the Duties of the Fir&s;t Table of the Law; they &s;eem to be very Religious towards GOD, in performing tho&s;e Duties of Wor&s;hip which He requires of them. They Pray to GOD in their Families, they Pray al&s;o in Secret, they frequent the Publick Wor|&s;hip and Ordinances of GOD, and are &s;eemingly Devout therein: And now they think they are Dutiful and Obedient Chri&s;tians, though it may be all this while they neglect the Duties of the Second Table of the Law: They are not Ju&s;t and Hone&s;t in their Dealings, they are not Charitable and Beneficent, they are not Cha&s;te and Sober.</P>
<P>AGAIN, On the other hand, Men are &s;ome|times &s;trict Ob&s;ervers of the Second Table o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

The Vanity of this Thought thus appears,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>GOD requires of Men Univer&s;al Obedience <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> His Commandments.</HI> He does not allow Men <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> di&s;pen&s;e with any of His Commands, but en|joins the Ob&s;ervation of them all, without Ex|ception.

Our Obedience ought to be as exten&s;ive as the Law of GOD, reaching to every part of it Every Duty required mu&s;t be practi&s;ed, and no one of them willingly Omitted. Unle&s;s there be &s;uch a Care to keep all the Commandment of GOD, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">our Obedience is un&s;ound.</P>

For there is no regard to the Authority of GOD in &s;uch Obe|dience. Things are to be done for this rea&s;on becau&s;e GOD Commands them: P&s;al. 119.4, 5. <HI>Thou ha&s;t commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently. O that my ways were directed to keep thy &s;tatutes</HI>! The Authority of GOD &s;hould be the ground of our Obedience; but now &s;uch as are par|tial in their Obedience, have no re&s;pect to the Authority of GOD: If that were their Mo|tive to keep any of the Commandments of GOD, it would move them to keep all His Command|ments; for the Authority of GOD is alike un&s;tamped on all the Commandments. Such then are Guilty of Contempt of the Divine Au|thority.
<PB N="66" REF="002302_0035_0FDB1CD05D96C4A0">
Again, in partial Obedience there is no Exerci&s;e of Love to GOD: Our Obedience ought to flow from a Principle of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ove to GOD. And when it does &s;o, is will make us &s;tudy to do all GOD's Will, 1 Joh. 5.3. <HI>For this is the Love of God, that we keep his Commandments; and his Commandments are not grievous.</HI> None of the Commands of GOD are grievous or di&s;ta&s;tefull to one that truly Loves GOD: He likes then all, and endeavours to keep them all.

<P>FROM the&s;e things it appears that Partial Obedience is not right and acceptable Obedience. Let us not then vainly think that it is true O|bedience: But on the other hand, let us think that Integrity or Univer&s;ality is e&s;&s;ential to E|vangelical Obedience: And accordingly let <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;hew our &s;elves Cordial Friends to Chri&s;t, by doing what&s;oever He has Commanded us.

<P N="1">1 <HI>IT is a</HI> Vain Thought, <HI>That meer extend Obedience is true Obedience.</HI> Some Men think, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> they do outwardly conform to the Law of GOD, they Obey it &s;ufficiently and acceptably.
<PB N="67" REF="002302_0035_0FDB1CD05D96C4A0">
Thus the Phari&s;ees e&s;teemed them&s;elves very &s;trict ob&s;ervers of the Law of GOD, when they only kept it Externally, doing no more than the outward Duties of Religion.

But this is a <HI>Vain Thought,</HI> as thus appears,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>GOD requires inward Obedience of Men, and that Principally.</HI> The Law of GOD is a Spiri|tual Law, Rom. 7.14. <HI>The Law is Spiritual.</HI> It is given as a Law to the Soul and Spirit of a Man. It reaches all the Faculties of the Soul, all the Affections of the Heart, and the Actings of them, requiring their Conformity thereunto. The Law of GOD is to be kept with our Spirits, as well as with our Bodies. GOD calls for the Heart and Spirit in His Service, Joh. 4.23, 24. <HI>The true Wor&s;hippers &s;hall Wor&s;hip the Father in Spirit and in Truth; for the Father &s;eeketh &s;uch to Wor&s;hip him.

exact in what they do. If their inward Thoughts, De&s;ires, Aims and Ends are not regulated by the Holy Law of GOD, they do not rightly obey GOD, though their Speeches and outward Actions be never &s;o Conformed to the Law of GOD. Out&s;ide Obedience, is the lea&s;t part of Obedience: Spiritual Obedience is the chief.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>OUTWARD Obedience without Inward, it exceeding di&s;plea&s;ing to GOD.</HI> So far is GOD from taking up &s;atisfied therewith, as that H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> abhorrs it.

'Tis His Blood which pacifies GOD, and turns away His Anger from us, and re|conciles us to GOD; Rom. 5.10. <HI>When we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the Death of his Son.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>OUR own Obedience cannot Merit Eternal Life for us, and therefore cannot Justify us before GOD.</HI> Ju&s;tification includes in it a Right to Eternal Life; 'tis therefore called, <HI>Ju&s;tification unto Life,</HI> Rom. 5.18.

<P N="7">7. <HI>THERE are</HI> Vain Thoughts <HI>in the hearts of Sinners concerning</HI> Faith, <HI>which are great Hin|drances of their being Saved.</HI> True Faith is e&s;|&s;ential to Salvation.

They re&s;ted in a naked A&s;&s;ent to the Go&s;pel Reve|lation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Such as the&s;e the A|po&s;tle <HI>James</HI> does particularly write again&s;t in his Epi&s;tle. And as there was then, &s;o there are &s;till many who think, that if they give Credit to the Doctrines of the Go&s;pel, they are &s;uch Believers as have the Promi&s;e of Salvation made to them: And hence 'tis that many reckon upon being Saved, becau&s;e they belong to that Body of Chri&s;tians, whom they &s;uppo&s;e to be mo&s;t Orthodox and &s;ound in the Faith: But this is a <HI>Vain Thought</HI> as will appear from two things.</P>

He that Loveth not our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t will be accur&s;ed; 1 Cor. 16.22. If Men therefore are deceived about their Love to Chri&s;t, and think they do really Love Him, when indeed they do not, they are in great danger of Peri&s;h|ing Eternally. Now it is a common thing for Men to profe&s;s Love to Chri&s;t, when as in Truth they are far from Loving Him aright: They have wrong Thoughts, mi&s;taken Notions concerning true Love to Chri&s;t, which prove <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tal to them in the I&s;&s;ue.

Their Love to it is not wholly taken away, but there are &s;ome remains of affection to Sin in them, and will be &s;o as long as they are in this World. Yet however, this Love to Sin is di&s;allowed and lamented. It is a grief and trouble to them to find in their Hearts any workings of good|will towards Sin, any tendencies unto delight in Sin. The&s;e relicks of Love to Sin, are the

lead and burden of their Souls; and being &s;o, they are con&s;i&s;tent with &s;incere Love to Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>BUT now, When Love to any Sin is al|lowed, cheri&s;hed and willingly entertained in the heart, there is no &s;incere Love to Chri&s;t in that heart Yet many may think, that Chri&s;t may be their Beloved, though they harbour &s;ome Beloved Lu&s;t in their Bo&s;oms. They think they may have a friend&s;hip for Chri&s;t, and a friend&s;hip for &s;ome Sin too.

<PB N="87" REF="002302_0045_0FDB1CEFE26FB838">
the taking that delight in it as formerly they did. Such is their Con&s;ternation through the Apprehen&s;ion of their danger of Peri&s;hing under the Wrath of GOD, that they do bewail their pa&s;t Sins, wi&s;h they had not committed them, are concerned about obtaining the Pardon of them, and have &s;ome Purpo&s;es of turning from them. Now when Sinners are under &s;uch a Convincing Sen&s;e of the Evil of their Sins and their Danger of Damnation, and are there|by brought to a Confe&s;&s;ion of their Sin and &s;ome Humiliation for it, they are ready to conclude them&s;elves really Converted; becau&s;e they are brought out of a State of &s;en&s;ele&s;s Security in Sin, they think they are brought into a State of Grace; but this may be a <HI>Vain Thought.</HI></P>

And does not frequent Experience te&s;tify, that awakened Sin|ners <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eturn to their former State of wretched Security in Sin? Their Convictions die away, their troubles for Sin are &s;oon over, their Fears and Concern about their Spiritual and Eternal Condition are at an end, and they grow more ea&s;y and quiet in Sin, than ever they were before: They do not cheri&s;h but quench the good Motions of the Holy Spirit upon their Souls, whereupon he cea&s;es to &s;trive with them, and &s;o they come to loo&s;e all &s;en&s;e and feeling <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f the Evil of Sin.</P>

Life. The Word here Tran&s;lated to <HI>Strive,</HI> &s;ignifies the putting forth all our Might and Strength, as the <HI>Combatants</HI> were won't to do, when they fought for a Prize: And &s;o it plainly intimates, that we mu&s;t give all Diligence to obtain Salvation. Thus al&s;o we have the Apo&s;tle giving that Exhortation to Chri&s;tians, Phil. 2.12. <HI>Work out your own Salvation with fear and trem|bling.</HI> We mu&s;t not give way to &s;loth and negligence, but be diligent in the u&s;e of all means conducing to our Salvation; and that with a &s;ollicitous Concern le&s;t we &s;hould mi&s;t of Salvation through a failure in our Duty. In the Bu&s;ine&s;s of our Eternal Salvation we mu&s;t not be &s;lothful, but fervent, &s;erious and vigo|rous. What&s;oever our hands find to do in this matter, we are to do it with all our might, <HI>Eccl.</HI> 9.10. The Go&s;pel is full of &s;uch calls to Di|ligence, Labour and Watchfulne&s;s in order to Salvation. Now the&s;e calls do mo&s;t evi|dently te&s;tify unto us, that 'tis no ea&s;y thing to be &s;aved. Were the obtaining Salvation a matter of no great Difficulty, all the&s;e Com|mands requiring our utmo&s;t Diligence, would be needle&s;s and impertinent.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>THE Oppo&s;ition in the way of Salvation is very great.</HI> There are a great many Adver&s;aries that labour to prevent our Salvation. There are <HI>Lu&s;ts within us, which war again&s;t our &s;ouls,</HI> 1 Pet. 2.11. The&s;e Lu&s;ts do all that they can to hinder the Salvation, and to procure the De&s;truction of our Souls. They ob&s;truct us in doing tho&s;e Duties which tend to the Salvation of our Souls, and they &s;ollicit us to the Com|mitting
<PB N="95" REF="002302_0049_0FDB1CFB4CDF0370">
tho&s;e Sins which tend to the ruin of our Souls. Indwelling Sin is an active Princi|ple, never idle, but always working more or le&s;s. And all its actings are con&s;tantly again&s;t the good and welfare of our Souls. Again, there is Satan who is a re&s;tle&s;s oppo&s;er of our Salvation; 1 Pet. 5.8. <HI>Your Adver&s;ary the Devil, as a roaring Lion, walketh about &s;eeking whom he may devour.</HI> His con&s;tant work and bu&s;ine&s;s is to tempt Men to Sin and &s;o to bring De&s;tructi|on upon them. He watches all Opportunities and takes hold of all Advantages to make them Sinful and Mi&s;erable. Again, There is the World which is full of Snares and Temptations. The <HI>Men of this World</HI> by their evil Coun&s;els and Examples, by their promi&s;es and threatnings, do much endanger our Salvation. The <HI>Things al&s;o of this World,</HI> thro' the inordinate Appetites in us after them, do very much oppo&s;e our Salvation. Our hearts are apt to be too much taken with them, too much &s;et upon them, to the neglect of GOD and our Souls: Yea, we are too apt to abu&s;e them by exce&s;s to the &s;atisfying our Lu&s;ts, and &s;o to the de&s;troying our Souls. There is then a great deal of Oppo&s;ition both from within and without which we meet with in the way to Salvation. The adver&s;aries are many, and potent, and skilfull to De&s;troy. It is not then an ea&s;y matter to with&s;tand all this oppo&s;ition, and to break thro' it unto Sal|vation. We mu&s;t daily Watch and Pray, and have our eve to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that His Grace may be &s;ufficient for us, or we &s;hall a&s;&s;uredly Peri&s;h by the hands of our Enemies.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="96" REF="002302_0050_0FDB1CFCC6419FA0">3. <HI>THE Duties required in order Salvation are exceeding Difficult.</HI> Indeed, <HI>The Commands of Chri&s;t are not in them&s;elves grievous,</HI> 1 Joh. 5.3. <HI>But his yoke is ea&s;y,</HI> Matth. 11.28. Chri&s;t's Com|mands in their own Nature are Ea&s;y, Plea&s;ant and Delightful; and as far as Per&s;ons are re|newed and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Holy Spirit, they do in &s;ome mea&s;ure experimentally find them &s;o: Yet however, thro' the Corruption of our Na|ture, Obedience to the Commands of Chri&s;t is become impo&s;&s;ible to unregenerate Per&s;ons, and difficult to the Regenerate in &s;ome degree, and e&s;pecially at &s;ome times. There are &s;ome Duties &s;o contrary, and cro&s;s to the Corrupt Inclina|tions of Nature, that they cannot readily be performed without much watchfulne&s;s over our own Spirits, and very much a&s;&s;i&s;tance from our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t: Of this nature, are tho&s;e Duties required. Math. 5.44. <HI>Love your enemies, ble&s;s them that cur&s;e you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which de&s;pitefully u&s;e you, and per&s;ecute you.</HI> 'Tis no ea&s;y thing for Men who are &s;ubject to &s;inful Pa&s;&s;ions and Infirmi|ties to do the&s;e things. Nor is it an ea&s;y thing to be content with every Condition, to give Thanks in every thing, to tru&s;t in GOD at all times, to deny our &s;elves, and take up our Cro&s;s and follow Chri&s;t. The&s;e are things which we cannot do without &s;pecial and abundant A&s;&s;i&s;tance from GOD our Saviour, <HI>Phil.</HI> 4.13.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>DUTIES of Obedience though difficult mu&s;t be per&s;evered in to the end.</HI> 'Tis not enough that we Obey GOD for a time, but we mu&s;t Obey Him always, in order to Salvation. Per&s;eve|rance
<PB N="97" REF="002302_0050_0FDB1CFCC6419FA0">
is a condition of Salvation; Math. 10.22. <HI>He that endureth to the end &s;hall be &s;aved.</HI> Rev. 1 10. <HI>Be thou faithful unto Death, and I will give thee a Crown of Life.</HI> There mu&s;t be a <HI>Patient continuance in well doing,</HI> in order to Eternal Life, <HI>Rom.</HI> 2.7. Such as Apo&s;tatize from their Pro|fe&s;&s;ion and Practice of Religion will Peri&s;h; Heb. 10.38 39. <HI>If any man draw back, my &s;oul &s;hall have no plea&s;ure in him, but we are not of them who draw back unto perdition.</HI> It is then nece&s;&s;ary unto Salvation, that we abide con&s;tant in the Service of GOD. Now it is no ea&s;y thing to bold on, and hold out to the end, in the way of GOD's Commandments, notwith&s;tanding all the Diffi|culties and Oppo&s;itions we meet withal. Let us not then entertain &s;uch a <HI>Vain Thought,</HI> that 'tis an ea&s;y thing to be Saved. But on the o|ther hand, let us look upon it as an exceeding difficult thing, and unto Man an impo&s;&s;ible thing to be Saved. Nothing &s;hort of Al|mighty Power can bring us into a &s;tate of Salvation; and nothing but the Mighty Power of GOD can pre&s;erve us in that E&s;tate, and bring us to the Con&s;ummation of it, in the Kingdom of Heaven. Nor may we expect that GOD will exert His Power unto our Sal|vation, unle&s;s we are diligent in the u&s;e of appointed Means. Let us not then &s;it &s;till and do nothing, as if the attainment of Salvation were a matter of greate&s;t Facility: But let us humbly wait on GOD in His own appointed way, being in&s;tant in Prayer to GOD Day and Night, following Him from one Ordinance to another, then may we hope, that GOD will meet us and Ble&s;s us, and &s;hew us His Salvation.</P>

</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>DIRECTIONS follow.</HEAD>
<P>Direct 1. <HI>LET us be jealous of our own hearts.</HI> Self-Jealou&s;y is a good preventive of Delu&s;ion. Our hearts are naturally <HI>Deceitful above all things,</HI> Jer. 17.9. If we be not exceeding watchful we &s;hall ea&s;ily be deceived by them: They are apt to flatter us, and to &s;ugge&s;t to us, that all is and &s;hall be well with us, when it is far from being &s;o. Thus it was with the Church of <HI>Laodicea,</HI> Rev. 3.17. <HI>Thou &s;aye&s;t, I am rich and increa&s;ed with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowe&s;t not that thou art wretched, and mi&s;erable, and poor, and blind, and naked.</HI> Our Deceiving hearts incline us to take up too favourable an opinion of our &s;elves, and to think our &s;tate and ways good, when they are not &s;o. It is therefore great folly to tru&s;t to the judgment of our own hearts, without an impartial and thorow Examination of the grounds it goes upon; Prov. 28.26. <HI>He that tru&s;teth in his own heart is a fool.</HI> It is our Wi&s;dom not to be too Credulous, when our hearts &s;peak well of the Thoughts we entertain, and the practices we allow our &s;elves in&punc; There will be more of Wi&s;dom, and le&s;s of Danger, to &s;u&s;pect our own hearts, than to be ha&s;ty in believing them: There can be no harm in being afraid le&s;t we &s;hould be de|ceived by them. We are more apt to err on the hand of Indulgence than of Severity; and there is more danger in &s;elf-Confidence, than &s;elf-Jealou&s;y: If we are jealous of our &s;elves, it
<PB N="107" REF="002302_0055_0FDB1D05A22D9688">
will only make us more concerned to be better, which will be no inconvenience to us. But if we are &s;elf-confident, we are in dan|ger of being Secure without due concern to amend what may be ami&s;s. Let us then put the &s;ame que&s;tion to our &s;elves, as was once put by <HI>Jehu,</HI> 2 King. 10.15. <HI>Is thy heart right</HI>? Let us enquire whether our hearts be right in the judgment they pa&s;s upon the No|tions which we e&s;pou&s;e, and the ways we walk in. He that is thus inqui&s;itive, is in an hopeful way not to be Deceived by <HI>Vain Thoughts.</HI></P>
<P>Direct. 2. <HI>LET us Labour to get a well-in|formed judgment. Vain Thoughts</HI> proceed ordina|rily from an erroneous Mind, Eph. 4.17, 18. <HI>Walk not as other Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind, having the under&s;tanding darkned.</HI> Rom. 1.21. <HI>They became vain in their imaginations, and their fooli&s;h heart was darkned.</HI> Vain Ima|ginations concerning GOD, and other things, proceed from blindne&s;s of Mind. We &s;hould therefore labour to get our Minds inlightned with the light of Truth. This will &s;erve to rectify our Thoughts, and prevent <HI>Vain Thoughts.</HI> To this end we mu&s;t Study the Scriptures which are a Light to di&s;cover to us the way of Truth and Error. If we Con|&s;ult tho&s;e Holy Oracles of GOD, they will inform us what Thoughts are <HI>Right</HI> and what are <HI>Vain.</HI> If then we would not be left to call Good Evil, and Evil Good, let us be Conver&s;ant with the Word of GOD, which is
<PB N="108" REF="002302_0056_0FDB11981AB7DFD0">
the only Rule whereby to know Good or Evil. Under&s;tanding in GOD's Precepts, will di&s;|cover to us <HI>Every fal&s;e way,</HI> P&s;al. 119.104. As ever then we de&s;ire not to be Deceived, let us acquaint our &s;elves with the unerring Word of GOD; and let us bring every Thought which we entertain to that Word, and thereby try whether it be a <HI>Vain Thought</HI> or not. If we Diligently and Con&s;cientiou&s;ly thus do, with a de&s;ire to come to the Knowledge of Truth and Duty, we may hope that we &s;hall not be left to the deceiving power of <HI>Vain Thoughts.</HI></P>
<P>Direct. 3. <HI>BE earne&s;t in Prayer to GOD.</HI> Un|to &s;elf-jealou&s;y and diligent &s;earching the Scrip|tures, we mu&s;t add fervent Prayer to GOD: This is a Duty in all Ca&s;es u&s;eful and nece&s;|&s;ary, but e&s;pecially in tho&s;e Ca&s;es which d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|mons immediately re&s;pect the Eternal &s;afety of our Souls; and &s;uch is the Ca&s;e before us.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>AND here three things we &s;hould earne&s;tly beg of GOD in Prayer. <HI>Viz.</HI></HEAD>

<P N="2">2. <HI>THAT GOD would graciou&s;ly deliver us from the deceiving Power of tho&s;e</HI> Vain Thoughts <HI>that may be in us.</HI> Though our <HI>Vain Thoughts</HI> &s;hould be di&s;covered to us; yet unle&s;s GOD put forth His Mighty Power, we &s;hall &s;till be deceived by them. <HI>John</HI> the Bapti&s;t di&s;cove|red to the carnal Jews the Vanity of their Ima|gination, that their Relation to <HI>Abraham</HI> as their Father, would &s;ecure them from De&s;truc|tion, Math. 3.9. <HI>And think not to &s;ay within your lives, we have Abraham to our Father.</HI> Yet not|with&s;tanding they remained under the Pow|er of this Vain Imagination. Nothing &s;hort of the mighty working of the Spirit of GOD can ca&s;t down the Vain Imaginations that are in us. We &s;hould therefore cry to GOD, that no &s;inful Thought may have Dominion over us, and that we may not be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to hold fa&s;t Deceit.</P>

If he now apply'd him&s;elf to a wrong Object, he went out of the World Guilty of Idolatry, and con&s;equently Peri&s;hed for ever: but this Man, who was <HI>Full of Faith and of the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> knew Je&s;us Chri&s;t to be the proper Object of Religious Wor&s;hip.

<P>THIS was the great Concern of Holy <HI>Ste|phen,</HI> who herein &s;hows what ought to be the Concern of every Man.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Under &s;everal Propo&s;itions this Doctrine may be &s;poken to.</HEAD>
<P>Prop. 1. <HI>THERE is a Spirit in Man which is a di&s;tinct Being from his Body.</HI> Man con&s;i&s;ts of two parts, a Spirit and a Body which are di&s;|tinct Sub&s;tances, and of a va&s;tly different Na|ture. Man is not all Body, but is principally Spirit. This is his Chief and mo&s;t Excellent Part: Though what and how Excellent it is, we do not our &s;elves perfectly know. The Body of Man is indeed, a mo&s;t wonderful and excel|lent Work of GOD; P&s;al. 139.14. <HI>I will prai&s;e thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.</HI> The frame and con&s;titution of the Body is truly mar|vellous. The Spirit of Man however is a far
<PB N="114" REF="002302_0059_0FDB1D0A20AD18D8">
more Glorious and Excellent Being than the Body. The Spirit of Man, has &s;uch a power of Thinking, as to be able in a Moment to ex|tend it's Thought beyond the utmo&s;t bounds of the whole Creation. It has &s;uch a power of Under&s;tanding, as to be able to di&s;cern between Truth and Error, Good and Evil. It has &s;uch a power of Election, as to be capable under|&s;tandingly to choo&s;e GOD for its la&s;t end and chief Good. It has &s;uch va&s;t and large De&s;ires, which all Created Good is not &s;uffici|ent fully to Satisfy. In &s;hort, it is a Being of far more worth and excellency than the whole World, Math. 16.26. <HI>What is a Man profited if he &s;hall gain the whole world, and lo&s;s his own Soul? Or what &s;hall a man give in exchange for his Soul?</HI></P>
<P>Prop. 2. <HI>THE Spirit of a Man remains after the Death of his Body.</HI> As for the Body that is Mor|tal and mu&s;t Die; &s;o has GOD Ordained, and &s;o it &s;hall be, Heb. 9.27. <HI>It is appointed unto men once to die.</HI> Death pa&s;&s;es upon all Men by the unalterable appointment of GOD; and at Death the Body peri&s;hes, turning to rottenne&s;s and du&s;t: But as for the Spirit of a Man that remains entire after the Di&s;&s;olution of the Body. The Spirit does not Peri&s;h with the Body, as Men may Athei&s;tically imagine.</P>
<P>Here,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>IT remains as to its E&s;&s;ence.</HI> For it is not capable of Di&s;&s;olution into any pre-exi&s;tent Prin|ciples as the Body is; and that becau&s;e it is formed immediately out of nothing. And tho' it be in the Power of GOD to annihilate it, or turn it into nothing again, yet He will not
<PB N="115" REF="002302_0059_0FDB1D0A20AD18D8">
thus do. He has plainly revealed it to us, that the Soul is of an immortal Nature, that it dies not with the Body, but &s;urvives it and exi&s;ts after Death, (which will be evinced under the following Propo&s;itions.)</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>IT remains as to it's Faculties and the Exer|ci&s;e of them.</HI> The Under&s;tanding, Will and Af|fections do &s;till continue and perform their pro|per Operations. The Spirit of a Man after Death does not cea&s;e to act its Rational Powers; but undoubtedly exerci&s;es them more vigorou&s;ly than ever. At Death it is freed from tho&s;e clogs and ob&s;tructions, which it often met with from the Body; and &s;o has nothing to hinder its exerting its Powers to the utmo&s;t. The way and man|ner of its acting is to us as yet unknown; yet this &s;hould not make us in the lea&s;t to que&s;tion the Truth of it; for we do not know the way of our Spirit's acting while it is in the Body: Who can comprehend the manner of the Souls acting by the &s;everal Organs of the Body? And yet we make not the lea&s;t doubt concerning the reality of its Actings. Why then &s;hould we di&s;believe the Activity of the Soul after Death, becau&s;e we cannot conceive the manner of its Operations? But that it Lives and Acts after Death, and is a Subject of Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s or Mi&s;ery will be hereafter &s;hown.</P>
<P N="3">Prop. 3. <HI>AFTER Death the Spirit of a Man remains not with the Body, but is &s;eparated from it.</HI> It does not abide in the Body, nor is it pre&s;ent with the Body, but departs from the Body; Gen. 35.18. <HI>And it came pa&s;s as her &s;oul was in
<PB N="116" REF="002302_0060_0FDB1D0EB7DEDF28">
departing; for &s;he died.</HI> 1 King. 17.21. <HI>Let this Childs &s;oul come into him again.</HI> It was then gone out of him. Death di&s;&s;olves the Union between Soul and Body, upon which the Soul immediately departs away from the Body. Hence after Death the Spirit is &s;aid to be ab&s;ent from the Body, 2 Cor. 5.8. <HI>We are willing rather to be ab&s;ent from the body i. e.</HI> as to our Spirits. After Death there is a real local di&s;tance between the Soul and Body, though how great a di&s;tance we know not in particular, only in general, they are as far di&s;tant from each other, as Heaven or Hell, the receptacles of Men's Spirits are from the Grave.</P>
<P>Prop. 4. <HI>THE Spirit of a Man upon its &s;epa|ration from the Body, goes to Je&s;us Chri&s;t as its Judge.</HI> The Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the Great Judge of all Men; all Judgment is committed unto Him. The la&s;t Judgment of Men and Angels will be managed by Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and &s;o is the particular Judgment of Men as to their Spirits immediately upon Death, their Spirits do then go to GOD their Judge, Eccl. 12.7. <HI>Then &s;hall the du&s;t return to the earth as it was, and the &s;pirit &s;hall return to God who gave it.</HI> The Spirits of Men do not all go to Heaven to appear in the immediate Pre&s;ence of the human nature of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for nothing unclean enters there|unto: But they go to Chri&s;t as GOD who is every where, and &s;o can manife&s;t him&s;elf in any Place what&s;oever. Tho' in what Place or after what manner He will thus manife&s;t Him|&s;elf, is unknown to us. But this we know that Je&s;us Chri&s;t has all Power in Heaven and Earth, power over all Fle&s;h, and power to Judge and
<PB N="117" REF="002302_0060_0FDB1D0EB7DEDF28">
Di&s;po&s;e of the &s;eparate Spirits of Men, Rev. 1.18. <HI>I am he that liveth, and was dean; and be|hold, I am alive for evermore, Amen, and have the Keys of Hell and Death.</HI> He has the Keys of Hell or the Invi&s;ible World: He has power to di&s;|po&s;e of the Spirits of Men when they pa&s;s out of this vi&s;ible, into the other invi&s;ible World.</P>
<P>Prop. 5. <HI>WHEN the Spirit of a Man goes to Chri&s;t after Death, it is received or rejected by Him.</HI> One or the other is what befalls the Soul of every Man, according to the State in which he dies.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>IF a Man die in a State of Sin, his Spirit is rejected by Chri&s;t the Righteous Judge.</HI> The Son of GOD Judges it, Condemns it, Bani&s;hes it from His Pre&s;ence, and ca&s;ts it into Hell. How this particular Judgment is managed, and how long it is in Tran&s;acting, we cannot &s;ay: But that Judgment pa&s;&s;es upon the &s;eparate Soul of a Sinner, and that the Judicial Sentence is exe|cuted upon it in its rejection from Chri&s;t into the place of Puni&s;hment, is mo&s;t evident from the Scriptures of Truth. Thus it is &s;aid con|cerning the World of ungodly Men who Peri&s;hed in the Blood, that <HI>their &s;pirits are in the infernal Pri&s;on,</HI> 1 Pet. 3.19. And it is &s;aid concerning the People of <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah,</HI> that they are actually <HI>Suffering the vengeance of Eternal Fire,</HI> Jude 7. Which can be under&s;tood only of their Spirits, for their Bodies were con&s;umed in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ire which turned the Cities into A&s;hes. Thus it is al&s;o &s;aid of the Wicked rich Man that when he died <HI>he went to Hell and was in Torments,</HI> Luk. 16.23. Which cannot be meant of his
<PB N="118" REF="002302_0061_0FDB1D10DA74C038">
Body for that was buried in a Grave. It was therefore his Soul which was tormented in the Flames of Hell; and though this be but a Pa|rable yet with the Scope it as clearly repre&s;ents to us the Mi&s;ery of &s;eperate &s;inful Souls, as if it were a real Hy&s;tory, and a&s;&s;erted it in the mo&s;t plain words. Again, We read concern|ing Treacherous <HI>Judas,</HI> that when he died, <HI>he went to his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> place,</HI> Acts 1.25. This place that he went to cannot mean the Grave, for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hat is not <HI>Judas</HI>'s own and proper place, but the common place of all Men good and bad, <HI>J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">b</HI> 30.23. It was therefore a place which of <HI>&s;pecial right</HI> belonged to him, as a Betrayer of the Lord of Glory, and this can be no other than Hell the place of Torments. And con|&s;equently he went to this place at Death, only as to his Spirit; his mi&s;erable Corps remain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> upon the Earth as a Spectacle of Horror, while his perfidious Spirit was Suffering the Ven|geance of GOD in the place of Devils.</P>
<P>THUS it appears from the Word of GOD, that the departed Spirits of ungodly Men are &s;eperated from Chri&s;t and &s;ent to Hell. And be&s;ides the Word of GOD, are there not many Providential Demon&s;trations of this Truth, in tho&s;e dreadful Angui&s;hes which &s;eize the Souls of Convinced Sinners, when they &s;ee the Day of their Death approaching?

<P N="1">1. <HI>THE Spirit of a Believer when received by Chri&s;t at Death enjoys</HI> immediate <HI>Communion with Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> While the Spirit of a Believer dwells here in the Body it is at a di&s;tance from the Lord Chri&s;t, but when it departs from the Body it goes into the immediate Per&s;onal Pre&s;ence of the Lord; 2 Cor. 5.6, 8. <HI>While we are at home in the body, we are ab&s;ent from the Lord.

Only this we are a&s;&s;ured of in ge|neral, that Glorified Spirits on their part, do immediately Exerci&s;e all their Powers and Graces upon Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in Contemplating, Loving, Wor&s;hipping and Serving of Him; Rev. 22.3, 4.

Furthermore, what &s;weet and Divine Con|ferences may pa&s;s between Chri&s;t and the Church Triumphant, we cannot &s;ay.

Chri&s;t now <HI>Comes into their &s;ouls, and &s;ups with them, and they with him,</HI> Rev. 3.20. They enjoy &s;ome manife&s;tations of Chri&s;t to them, but not full.

There the Saints Love Chri&s;t with all their Heart, with all their Soul, with all their Mind, and with all their Might. Their Love goes out to Chri&s;t in its full Strength, and all their Graces are acted on Him in the highe&s;t degree.

The con&s;tant ri&s;ings and workings of Corruption in them, do always in &s;ome mea&s;ure disturb their free Con|ver&s;e with Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Such is the remaining vanity and un&s;teadine&s;s of the mind, that it often wanders from Chri&s;t in the Duties of Com|munion. The be&s;t of GOD's Servants do &s;adly experience how difficult a thing it is to keep their Hearts engaged in clo&s;e Communion with Chri&s;t, and how apt are they to &s;tart a|&s;ide from Him in Holy Duties. Again, &s;ome|times Holy Men do fall into &s;uch Sins which provoke Chri&s;t greatly to withdraw from them, and which do very much e&s;trange their Hearts from Chri&s;t.

<P><HI>THAT Men are &s;o unconcerned about having their Spirits received by Chri&s;t at Death.</HI> Alas! how little is it the Concern of Men, that their Immortal Spirits may in a Dying Hour be re|ceived into the Redeemers Arms! How many are there that very &s;eldom, if ever, do enter|tain &s;erious Thoughts of Death! in&s;tead hereof they put the Thoughts of Death far away from them. They think of <HI>Living,</HI> but not of <HI>Dying.</HI> They are concerned how they &s;hall <HI>Live,</HI> but un|concerned how they &s;hall <HI>Dye.</HI> They are daily taking thought for the <HI>Body,</HI> what they &s;hall eat, what they &s;hall drink, and what they &s;hall put on; but all this while take no thought about their <HI>Souls,</HI> as to what &s;hall be done for them, or what &s;hall become of them. How do Men Live as if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> had no Souls in them, or as if they were not worth the minding, or as if it
<PB N="137" REF="002302_0070_0FDB1D28269B1650">
were an indifferent thing who had them after Death! How a&s;toni&s;hing is it that Men &s;hould thus Live under the Go&s;pel which &s;o clearly brings Life and immortality to light! How &s;trange and unaccountable is it, that Men pro|fe&s;&s;ing Belief of the immortality of their Souls, and of their pa&s;&s;ing into a State of Eternal Ble&s;|&s;edne&s;s or Mi&s;ery immediately after Death, &s;hould yet be &s;o unconcerned for them; Men believe that they mu&s;t certainly and &s;hortly Die, and it may be very &s;peedily. They believe that after Death comes the Judgment in which their Souls &s;hall be acquitted or condemned, recei|ved into Heaven or ca&s;t down into Hell by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the great Judge. They Believe the&s;e things, they &s;ay, and yet are very little con|cerned whether their Souls at Death be received or rejected by Chri&s;t, whether they go to Hea|ven or to Hell. How amazing is &s;uch &s;tupidity and negligence? O let us take heed that we be not found of this number of &s;ecure and &s;otti&s;h Creatures, who neglect to make due Provi&s;ion for the future welfare of their Spirits. If we are carele&s;s in this matter, how lightly &s;oever we now account of it, we &s;hall hereafter bitterly bewail it. We &s;hall Mourn at the la&s;t, but with a fruitle&s;s Mourning, which will be an Aggravation of our Sorrow. Undoubtedly, When the Souls of Sinners after Death appear before the Tribunal of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, they are &s;en&s;ible of their Sin and Folly in the neglect of them&s;elves. Undoubtedly, they expre&s;s a Grief &amp; Repentance for tho&s;e neglects. Undoubtedly, they wi&s;h for, and de&s;ire either a return to this World to Reform their neglects, or a Reception
