<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Chri&s;tian Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>WHAT</HI> is here Emitted in the Sub&s;equent Pages, was never Preach'd to be Printed, but only to be Succeeded with Pray|ers, for an Impre&s;&s;ion upon the Hearts of the Hearers: and Publi&s;hed to Gratify &s;uch Pious well Affected Per&s;ons, who having received &s;ome fruit &amp; benefit thereby them&s;elves; were willing to be at Expences in Publi&s;hing what is here pre&s;ented, with a &s;ingle aim at the Profit of their Neighbours: and that the Seed &s;own might yet produce more Fruit, to the Glory of God.</P>
<P>The Author would have been very well Sa|tisfyed &amp; Contented, if the En&s;uing Sheets had been lodg'd in &s;ilence, with the Re&s;t of his U&s;e|le&s;s Manu&s;cripts, as being &s;en&s;ible, that what is Expo&s;ed to Publick View (tho' the be&s;t Ends be aimed at) is Expo&s;ed to the Cavils

and Cen&s;ures of &s;uch, who Read only to Pa&s;s their Verdict upon the Worth or Weakne&s;s of the Author; rather than for any Edification or Profit.</P>
<P>But &s;ince (thro' Grace) the Seed hath fallen upon &s;ome Good Ground, &amp; Pro&s;pered; as it doth abundantly Compen&s;ate the Barrenne&s;s of the other Sorts of Soil; So it doth arm again&s;t the Reflections of tho&s;e, who are wont to Redi|cule the Fooli&s;hne&s;s of Preaching: Remembring al&s;o the Obligations I lye under to a kind Peo|ple, whom I have Served in the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t upwards of Thirty Years; and who may ju&s;tly Challenge any of my Poor Labours, for their Rewards.</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e Grounds, what hath been Publick|ly delivered, could not Rea&s;onably be denied a farther Publication; E&s;pecially the Subject In&s;i&s;ted on (tho' weakly managed by the Author) yet it is of the greate&s;t Importance in the&s;e Latter, Declining, Apo&s;tatizing Days; wherein (as our Saviour hath foretold, <HI>Luk. 18.8.) That Faith &s;hall &s;carce be found on Earth;</HI> and wherein mo&s;t are &s;o be&s;otted to the Earth, that they are mi&s;erably bewilder'd in their way to Heaven: Ignorance, Athei&s;m, Errour &amp; Epi|curi&s;m be&s;ot the World: Millions are born

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>OUR Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the Great Prophet of his Church; and the Apo&s;tle &amp; high Prie&s;t of our Profe&s;&s;ion, was wont to reveal the My&s;teries
<PB N="2" REF="001527_0007_0FB39DC8B495B350">
of the Kingdom of Heaven in Parables; and in Parables to utter things, that have been kept Secret from the Foundation of the World. Great truths were thus Parabolically Delivered, Enigmatical and hard to be under|&s;tood &amp; di&s;cerned; a &s;ingular judgment upon Go&s;pel-De&s;pi&s;ers for their Contumacious In|fidelity; Lea&s;t at any time, they &s;hould &s;ee with their Eyes&punc; &amp; hear with their Ears; under&s;tand with their-Hearts; and &s;hould be Converted &amp; Healed; Our Saviour there|fore &s;pake to them in Parables; <HI>&amp; without a Parable Spake He not unto them,</HI> Matt. 13.15. <HI>But who is wi&s;e &s;hall under&s;tand the&s;e things; Prudent, and he &s;hall know them.</HI> The&s;e My&s;teries (tho' My&s;tically Revealed) the true Followers &amp; Di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t &s;hall be in&s;tructed in them.</P>
<P>Our Saviour (in the Chapter, wherein you find our Text) ob&s;erving the Infidelity and Unfruitfulne&s;s of great Numbers of his Hearers &amp; Followers; He puts forth a Pa|rable admirably adapted to the Purpo&s;e; to &s;et forth the various Efficacy of the Word (the Seed of Faith) upon four &s;everal Sorts of Hearers, <HI>viz.</HI> By the Parable of the <HI>Sower,</HI> and the <HI>Seed,</HI> that fell upon four &s;everal Sorts
<PB N="3" REF="001527_0008_0FB39DCA37D66730">
of the Ground; the <HI>High Way,</HI> the <HI>Stony Ground,</HI> the <HI>Thorny Ground,</HI> &amp; the <HI>Good Ground.</HI></P>
<P>The Parable is (1) Propounded <HI>v.</HI> 5, 6, 7, 8. (2) Expounded in our Text &amp; Context.</P>
<P>In our Text, under the Parable of the Seed that fell on Stony Places (or on the Rock) our Saviour Detecting a Sort of Hearers, upon whom the Word (the Seed of Faith) falling, it had two notable Effects. (1) Mo|ving the Affections [<HI>When they Hear they Re|ceive the Word with joy.</HI>] (2) Operating Faith. [<HI>Which for a while Believe.</HI>] The Seed of the Word, Received with Joy, Produced this Fruit. [<HI>Faith</HI>] Which Fruit is De&s;cribed three ways in our Text.</P>
<P N="1">1. From its Sprouting &amp; Springing: It Sprang from a Sudden Pang &amp; Fla&s;h of Joy in Hearing.</P>
<P N="2">2. From its La&s;ting &amp; Continuing: they Believe for a while, &amp; indeed it was but for a While: it was not long &amp; la&s;ting.</P>
<P N="3">3. From its Wa&s;ting and Withering, Occa|&s;ioned by the Scorching Sun of Temptation. [<HI>In the Time of Temptation they fall away.</HI>] So <HI>Mat.</HI> 13.6. <HI>When the Sun was up, they were Scorch|ed</HI>: and the Rea&s;on is Render'd; <HI>Becau&s;e they had in Root, they withered away.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="001527_0009_0FB39DCBB0ECA0B0">So in our Text [The&s;e have no Root; <HI>Which for a while Believe,</HI> &amp;c.] Their Faith was not well bottom'd, well Rooted, but like the Seed, that fell on the Rock, where po&s;&s;i|bly there was &s;ome Earth, on the Top of the Rock; or Work'd into the Roots of the Rock: but no depth of Earth: Hence the Roots being Shallow, when the Sun aro&s;e, the moi&s;ture was &s;oon dried up; and the Sprouting &s;oon turned to Withering.</P>
<P>So it was with the Seed of Faith, that fell upon the&s;e Hearers; there was &s;ome &s;hallow Earth, but the Rock at the Bottom; the Heart Unbroken, Unhumbled, Un&s;ubdued; hence the Seed had &s;ome Sprouting but took no Rooting: Their fla&s;hy affections, in Hear|ing the Word, had no Principles, to maintain them; therefore came to nothing. The Root of the matter was not in them: they wanted depth of Earth: The Plough had not gone deep enough; and therefore, tho' the Earth were good and the Seed good; yet not be|ing well covered, it mi&s;carries: <HI>Exoriuntur &s;ed Exuruntur</HI>: the Roots are burnt up, like the Wicked, Job 18.16. <HI>His Roots are Dri|ed up beneath; and above his Bud is cut off.</HI></P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee what becomes of the Faith of
<PB N="5" REF="001527_0010_0FB39DCFF6903F18">
the Stony Ground Hearers: they had a Faith; but not being well Bottom'd &amp; Rooted, it was not Sound &amp; Saving: they fell away &amp; mi&s;&s;ed of Heaven, in the Height of their Hopes, not|with&s;tanding their Faith.</P>
<P>Admi&s;t the many Truths, that are Deduci|ble from this Text, we are to take notice of this one; from tho&s;e Words, [<HI>Who for a while Believe; and in time of Temptation fall away.</HI>]</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD><HI>DOCTRINE.</HI> There is a Believing, or a Faith which many that Sit under the Hearing of the Word Preached, may attain unto, that is not Sound and Effectually Saving; or notwith|&s;tanding which, Per&s;ons may fall away and Mi&s;carry in Point of Salvation.</HEAD>
<P>There is a believing or a Faith which ma|ny attain unto, thro' a Delight in Hearing the Word Preached; who yet mi&s;carry in Point of Salvation: So it was with the Stony Ground, they Heard the Word with Delight; they Re|ceived it with joy; which Produced a Faith [the Genuine Fruit of Hearing the Word, <HI>For Faith comes by Hearing,</HI> Rom. 1.16.]
<PB N="6" REF="001527_0011_0FB39DD0F2E5CCE8">
And when Faith Springs from Delight in Hear|ing the Word; Such per&s;ons are ready to think them&s;elves in a &s;ure and &s;afe E&s;tate; and that their Faith is well bottom'd, they bid fair for Heaven: But even &s;uch may be De|ceived and mi&s;carry in the great Point of Sal|vation, for want of laying a good Foundati|on; there being nothing of the Work of Hu|miliation: they never went to the Bottom, to break the Rock at the Heart: Saving Faith hath Humiliation laid for its Foundati|on, When Faith ari&s;eth only from a Fla&s;h of Delight in Hearing the Word, it is but a Counterfeit and not La&s;ting. Many Apo|&s;tates have had many meltings &amp; much Sud|dain &s;trong joy: So had tho&s;e Stony Ground Hearers; but it amounted not to Saving Faith. They had &s;ome flight Knowledge of Chri&s;t, their affections were &s;tirred; their under&s;tandings were gilded over with a Com|mon kind of Supernatural Light, (<HI>Heb.</HI> 6.4.) but not to a Tran&s;mentation. They were Ele|vated in Hearing the Word; and had &s;ome A&s;cen&s;ions upwards, in their Affections; but were like Meteors hanging a while in the air, not having &s;trength enough to a&s;cend to the upper Region: Hence they &s;oon vani&s;h:
<PB N="7" REF="001527_0012_0FB39DD273FC1718">
their Faith fails and comes to nothing.</P>
<P>The Word [<HI>The Seed of Faith</HI>] in the Pa|rable, falls upon four Sorts of Ground; but it takes Rooting in but One. The Good Seed, if not ca&s;t into the Good Ground, it yields no Harve&s;t. The Word [<HI>The Seed of Faith</HI>] it mi&s;carry's in mo&s;t: It is trampled upon by the High Way Hearers; and the Devil Ca&s;hiers it: the Devil comes and picks the Word out of their Hearts; le&s;t they &s;hould Believe &amp; be Saved, <HI>v.</HI> 12. The Seed of Faith in others &s;oon withered and &s;corch'd up; as in the Stony Ground: Faith in others is chocked &amp; &s;tifled; as in the Thorny Ground; Eminently with tho&s;e three Chokers, the Cares, &amp; Riches &amp; Plea&s;ures of the World.</P>
<P>The Seed of Faith Pro&s;pers only in the Good Ground: there, tho' &s;mall and as a Grain of Mu&s;tard-feed, it grows and flouri&s;h|eth to Life Eternal.</P>
<P>It had &s;ome fair Beginnings in the Stony Ground and Thorny Ground; there were &s;ome motions, &s;ome meltings &amp; &s;ome Good Affections, &s;ome Breathings in Prayer; and Delight in Ordinances; as in Hearing the Word, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Here were fair Beginnings! So it is with many. Oh! &s;ee how far a man
<PB N="8" REF="001527_0013_0FB39DD3F511FBB8">
may go; and yet be never the near after all. The Stony and the Thorny Ground were nearer to the nature of the Good Ground, than that of the High Way; and yet no Fruit of Faith: they fell Short of Heaven. They had &s;ome &s;proutings of Faith, a &s;ort of Faith; but yet far &s;hort of Saving: they attained to a Faith but yet (our Text tells us,) <HI>They fell away,</HI> and mi&s;&s;ed of Salvation.</P>
<P>It is not Every Faith, that is Saving: there are many that attain to a Faith; but yet ne|ver obtain the End of their Faith. It is a mo&s;t certain Truth, That there are many Be|lievers that &s;hall never be Saved; for all Faith in the Name of Chri&s;t is not &s;ound &amp; &s;aving. It is true, it is granted, that Faith or Believing is the Go&s;pel Condition of Salvation, <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.16.36. <HI>Act.</HI> 16.31. <HI>Mark.</HI> 16.16. <HI>He that Be|lieveth &s;hall be Saved, but he that Believeth not &s;hall be Damned.</HI> Faith &amp; Salvation are in&s;eparably Connected; and without Faith there is no Salvation. This is the Hinge of our Salvation: Here is the Condition of Life under the new Covenant: The Covenant of Grace is, <HI>Believe</HI> &amp; <HI>Live; Believe</HI> &amp; be <HI>Saved.</HI> Faith is the Condition; but then you had need look to your Faith, that it be of the
<PB N="9" REF="001527_0014_0FB39DD5BB61B8A0">
Right Stamp: a Faith of the Operation of God; for Every Believing is not Saving: there are many that Believe &amp; are Damned; as well as others that Believe and are Saved. Great Numbers Pretend to Faith; &amp; Hold up a Head of Profe&s;&s;ion; but there are ma|ny Profe&s;&s;ors that are no Believers; and ma|ny Believers, that have not Faith; and ma|ny, that have Faith, that mi&s;s of Heaven.</P>
<P>Many there are of Great Profe&s;&s;ion, that Live and Dye in &s;trong Delu&s;ion; &amp; mi&s;s of Heaven in the Height of their Hopes; being mi&s;taken, as to the Foundation of their Faith. There are many in Hell, that have had a Pre&s;umptuous Confidence that they &s;hould get to Heaven: <HI>Prae&s;umendo Sperant &amp; Sperando Pereunt</HI>: Many Damned, that have been Per&s;waded, they &s;hould be Saved: there are many, that go believing to Hell; their Eyes never opened till &s;hot into the other World.</P>
<P>Many grow bold in an Ignorant Sotti&s;h Conceit of their good E&s;tate, becau&s;e of &s;ome good affections; &amp; becau&s;e they have &s;ome &s;lighter Experiences, tho' un&s;ound: &s;ome ta&s;te of the good Word of God and a Faith, that hath &s;prung from a Delight in Hearing the
<PB N="10" REF="001527_0015_0FB39DD6F146C6D0">
Word: they have Received the Word with joy; as the &s;tony Ground; which for a while Believe; and yet mi&s;carry at la&s;t and mi&s;s of Heaven; their Faith being not the Faith of Gods Elect; as wanting its true Object, and a Good Foundation, having no Root; and therefore cannot &s;tand in the Day of Tryal, again&s;t the Burning Tempe&s;t &amp; Floods of the Wrath of God to come: tho&s;e &s;corch|ings will wither up their &s;hallow Roots.</P>
<P>But for a more methodical Proceeding, in the management of the Truth in Hand briefly.</P>

<P N="5">V. I &s;hall briefly lay down, <HI>The Signs of an un&s;ound; and the Nature of a Sound and Saving Faith: which may lead on to &s;ome &s;uitable Application.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>For Confirmation</HI>; The Scriptures of
<PB N="11" REF="001527_0016_0FB39DD9727EAE78">
Truth tell us, that there are many Believers, <HI>That &s;hall never be Saved</HI>: Our Text produceth an in&s;tance in the &s;tony Ground Hearers, they were called <HI>Believers</HI>: they had a Faith, yet that their Faith was not Sound and Saving; as appears from the la&s;t Clau&s;e of the ver&s;e, [<HI>In time of Temptation they fell away.</HI>] There is a Believing, that doth not put the Subjects into a &s;tate of Salvation: many may be Be|lievers on the Name of Chri&s;t; and yet not true and effectual Believers; as many Be|lieved, when they &s;aw the Miracles which he did; and yet were &s;hort of Saving Faith, <HI>Joh.</HI> 2.23: Men may believe on Chri&s;t with &s;ome kind of Faith; &amp; yet never be Accepted and Entertained by Chri&s;t with his Peculiar Love; and Con&s;equently never Saved.</P>
<P>All Faith in the Name of Chri&s;t is not &s;ound and &s;aving: this truth is confirmed al&s;o from other Scriptures: We read, <HI>Joh.</HI> 12.42, 43. <HI>Among the chief rulers many Believed on him; but becau&s;e of the Phari&s;ees, they did not confe&s;s him; for they loved the prai&s;e of men, more than the prai&s;e of God</HI>; and therefore Chri&s;t tells them, <HI>Joh.</HI> 5.44 That &s;uch a Believing could be no true Faith. [<HI>How can ye Believe, that receive honour, one of another&punc;</HI>] See, <HI>Acts</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="001527_0017_0FB39DDBAED44030">
4.4, 32. We read there of a great Multitude, that are called <HI>Believers,</HI> to the number of about five Thou&s;and; but yet there were in that croud of Believers, &s;undry that were un|&s;ound; as appears by the &s;pecial in&s;tance of <HI>Ananias</HI> &amp; <HI>Saphira, Chap.</HI> 5. So, <HI>Act.</HI> 8.13.

See, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.19. <HI>Holding Faith and a good Con&s;cience, which &s;ome having put away, concer|ning Faith have made &s;hipwrack</HI>; and therefore they were Bottoms, laden with &s;ome kind of Faith: they had of that ware in their ve&s;&s;els; how el&s;e could they make &s;hipwrack of it: So, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.5.

<P N="2">II. We may Enquire, <HI>What Sorts of Belie|vers tho&s;e are that mi&s;carry in Point of Salva|tion</HI>; that do Believe, but not Effectually.</P>

<P>Indeed tho&s;e in the Text went farther than thus; for they did not only &s;eem, Pretend and Counterfeit a Believing; but had &s;ome real Common work upon them: But yet tho&s;e others are in a large &s;en&s;e called Belie|vers, that do make an Outward Profe&s;&s;ion, as many do for fa&s;hions &s;ake; out of Cu&s;tom; Example of others; to plea&s;e men; to be well &s;poken of, to gain Credit, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> tho' they have no Love to God, nor his ways, in their Souls.

So men go in the croud (as they from Egypt) the&s;e, in a large &s;en&s;e, are called Believers, who &s;eem before men to Believe, when all this while, there is no truth of Grace in their Hearts. There is a

great deal of &s;eemingne&s;s in the World; and Every Grace hath its Counterfeit; and tho&s;e that have no Grace, can for a while Look and Live like Saints.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another &s;ort of Per&s;ons, who pretend to Faith; but fall &s;hort, are tho&s;e, <HI>That have &s;ome Impre&s;&s;ions upon their Minds &amp; Hearts, and do really believe</HI> (and not only &s;eem to do &s;o) <HI>with &s;ome kind of Faith, which yet is not Saving and Effectual</HI>: there is &s;omething, that looks like true Faith: they have &s;ome kind of work wrought upon them; it is not a meer outward <HI>Seeming</HI>; they have &s;ome kind of actings in their Minds and Hearts towards Chri&s;t; &s;ome &s;tirrings of Affections.

<P N="1">1. <HI>Men may take up a Profe&s;&s;ion of the Truth; and not only &s;eemingly, but Really</HI>: they may do as others do; be carried in the &s;tream and croud of Profe&s;&s;ors, in the Place, where they are; attend Ordinances; take up the Name of God &amp; Chri&s;t, into their Mouths; &s;eem to be Religious, <HI>Jam.</HI> 1.26.

at lea&s;t in a general Way</HI>; both know the Heads and Truths of Religion; and al|&s;o Believe them; Believe that Chri&s;t is the Son of God &amp; Saviour of the World. Men may believe the great Truths concerning his Per&s;on, Natures, Offices, Benefits; The My&s;tery of his Incarnation, His Birth, Cruci|fixion, Death, Burial, Re&s;urrection, A&s;cen&s;ion, Se&s;&s;ion at the Right Hand of God, &amp; Inter|ce&s;&s;ion there, His coming to Judgment; the Re&s;urrection of the Body, &amp; the Life Ever|la&s;ting. <HI>In a word</HI>; a man may know all the Heads &amp; Points &amp; Principles of Religion; and Believe all the Articles of the Chri&s;tian Creed; and yet mi&s;carry in Point of Salvati|on, for want of Effectual Saving Faith.</P>
<P>A man may believe, that Chri&s;t is the Sa|viour; and yet fall &s;hort of Saving Faith; not having a di&s;tinct under&s;tanding of the way of clo&s;ing with Chri&s;t in his Offices, as the object of Faith: So they, <HI>Joh.</HI> 6.12.

<PB N="16" REF="001527_0021_0FB39DE177945138">
that he was indeed the Me&s;&s;iah, that was to come; and therefore they believed on his Name: tho' they did not take up his Name aright. There was a common work of Grace upon their Hearts: there was a general work of Conver&s;ion wrought in them; but not Saving Faith: But hence they cry out; <HI>This is of a Truth the Prophet that &s;hould come</HI>; and &s;o; <HI>Joh</HI> 7.31. <HI>And many of the People Be|lieved on him, &amp; &s;aid, when Chri&s;t cometh will he do more Miracles than the&s;e which this Man hath done.</HI> The&s;e you &s;ee, had a Faith; and what they did under&s;tand of Chri&s;t &amp; of his Doctrine, they did believe it to be true. And thus there are many, that do A&s;&s;ent to the Fundamental Truths of the Go&s;pel: they believe what the Scriptures &s;ay concerning Chri&s;t, &amp; the way of Salvation by Faith in him; but yet fall &s;hort of Saving Faith&punc;</P>

<P N="3">III. We may Enquire, <HI>What Sorts of Faith &s;uch attain unto</HI>?</P>
<P>This may be ea&s;ily gathered from the &s;orts of Believers, that pretend to a Faith; but it is not Sound and Saving. There are two Sorts of Faith, that are not Saving, <HI>viz.</HI> an <HI>Hi&s;torical,</HI> &amp; a <HI>Temporary</HI> Faith.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>An Hi&s;torical Faith.</HI> Many, yea mo&s;t, that live under the Sound of the Go&s;pel, may attain to this; and do content &amp; quiet their Hearts with a bare, Notional Know|ledge &amp; A&s;&s;ent to the Doctrine of the Go&s;pel: On this Sandy Bottom mo&s;t Profe&s;&s;ors Build their Hopes for Heaven; and claim their Pri|viledges among the be&s;t of Saints on Earth; even to Eat and Drink in Chri&s;ts Pre&s;ence. Indeed without knowledge the Mind cannot be good; and the Hi&s;tory and Knowledge
<PB N="19" REF="001527_0024_0FB39DE79534C5A0">
of Go&s;pel Truths is nece&s;&s;ary and leading on to a Saving Faith. See, <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.14. <HI>How &s;hall they Believe on him, of whom they have not Heard</HI>? Yet a bare Hi&s;torical Faith will Scarce Di&s;tingui&s;h the Faith of Men from the Faith of Devils, <HI>Jam.</HI> 2.19. <HI>Thou Be|lieve&s;t there is One God; Thou doe&s;t well; The Devils al&s;o Believe and Tremble.</HI> They Believe there is a God and they Tremble at his Wrath: their Hearts ake and Tremble within them. They Believe, that Chri&s;t is the Son of God and the Saviour of Men: See the Confe&s;&s;ion of their Faith, in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed Gerge&s;ene, <HI>Matt.</HI> 8.29. <HI>What have we to do with thee, Je&s;us, Thou Son of God: art thou come to Torment us before our Time?</HI> The De|vils Believe and Tremble; but how many among us, wor&s;e than Devils in this Re&s;pect, that Believe, but never Tremble at the Wrath of God; and at the Wrath of the Lamb; a Generation of Gods Wrath; who are warned, but never awakened to flee from the Wrath to come, <HI>Matt,</HI> 3.7. They Be|lieve the Judgment, and Know the Terrour of the Lord; they have an Hi&s;torical Faith, but more Regardle&s;s than Devils; They Be|lieve the <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> of Go&s;pel Truths revealed;
<PB N="20" REF="001527_0025_0FB39DE9082E0E20">
but are Strangers to the <HI>My&s;tery</HI> of Godline&s;s: The Hi&s;tory of the Great Truths of the Go&s;pel, Relating to the object of Saving Faith, may be attained by Reading, In&s;tructi|on, by acquaintance with the Holy Scrip|tures opened and applied in the ordinary Di&s;pen&s;ations of the Mini&s;try; but the My|&s;teries of tho&s;e Go&s;pel Truths can never be di&s;cerned, without Supernatural and Saving Illuminations of the Spirit working Faith in the Soul. A man may have his natural un|der&s;tanding informed in the Doctrinal Truths, nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation; but his Mind blinded by Satan, lea&s;t the Light of the Glorious Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, which is the Image of God, &s;hould &s;hine into him, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.4. A bare Hi&s;torical Faith is, when the Mind only gives a&s;&s;ent to the Truth, without any work up|on the Heart; this is a Sort of Faith, but far from Saving.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>There is a Temporary (or rather an In|effectual) Faith.</HI> When there is &s;ome work on the Heart; but not thorough and &s;olid: So the Stony Ground in our Text, and o|thers that we read of, that were Chri&s;ts Followers; they not only Believed the Doctrine of Chri&s;t, &s;o far as they knew of
<PB N="21" REF="001527_0026_0FB39DEA7479EDF0">
it, but al&s;o their Hearts were Affected: they Heard the word with joy: they did not meer|ly di&s;&s;emble; but they had their Hearts awed and affected with the Maje&s;ty and Power of Chri&s;ts Doctrine and Miracles: So that for a while, they Believed: they had a Tempo|rary Faith, now this Temporary Faith, where there is &s;ome kind of lighter work upon the Heart, which is not thorough, it may Expre&s;s it &s;elf &s;undry Ways, (as we find in the Scrip|tures) <HI>viz.</HI> From hence, from this Tempora|ry Faith, there may be,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>A Forwardne&s;s in men to give up their Names to Chri&s;t,</HI> to become his Followers and Profe&s;&s;ed Di&s;ciples; to Enrol their Names in that little Flock and Company, that are for Heaven, <HI>Matt.</HI> 8.19. <HI>Ma&s;ter</HI> (&s;aid that Scribe) <HI>I will follow thee, whither&s;oever thou goe&s;t, Luk.</HI> 9.61, 62.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>There may be a ta&s;te of the Sweetne&s;s of the Things of Chri&s;t, of his Word, Grace, Be|nefits and Heavenly Priviledges,</HI> Heb. 6.4&mdash;6. Having a ta&s;te of the Gift of Faith; they may al&s;o have a Tran&s;itory and Lighter Partici|pation of the Sweetne&s;s of the Word and Joys of Heaven, by &s;ome Hopes and Pangs of Tran&s;porting Affection: as Balaam had,

<HI>Numb.</HI> 23.10 <HI>Who can Count the Du&s;t of Ja|cob and the Number of the fourth Part of I|&s;rael? Let me dye the Death of the Righteous, and let my la&s;t End be like his.</HI> So the Sto|ny Ground, in the Text, Joy in Hearing the Word and the affecting things therein.</P>
<P>And &s;o, on the other &s;ide, there may be Tears and Terrours in the apprehen&s;ions of Wrath; as in <HI>Felix</HI> and <HI>Ahab</HI> and <HI>Judas</HI>: The Affections may be &s;tirred; and yet the Rock, the &s;tone in the Heart never broken; the Will and Affection never throughly bro|ken and transformed; the Con&s;cience never purged; and the Heart never took off from all other things to cleave to Chri&s;t alone.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>There may be a Doing of &s;everal Emi|nent Services for Chri&s;t</HI>; for which they may have much applau&s;e from men and be lifted up in the Mouths of others, <HI>Matt.</HI> 7.22. They may be Mini&s;ters admired in their Preach|ing, Preach well, and they may be In|&s;trumental in their Places, and by their Gifts, to do much Good: God may &s;o Sanctify a mans Gifts, as to make them Profitable to others; and yet not unto the Salvation of his own Soul.</P>

They were but for the Pre&s;ent overpowred and a&s;toni&s;hed by the Maje&s;ty, appear|ing in Chri&s;t, and in his Word: So <HI>Matt.</HI> 7.28, 29. <HI>And it came to Pa&s;s, when Je&s;us had Ended the&s;e Sayings, the People were a&s;toni&s;hd at his Doctrine; for he taught them, as one having Authority and not as the Scribes.</HI> They were &s;trangely tran&s;ported and rap'd with an Exta&s;y of admiration and amaze|ment, at his Doctrine; for he taught them, as having authority: but how many Heard Chri&s;t at that Time, who in Hearing did not Hear: yet all this that we have been &s;peaking of falls &s;hort, becau&s;e the whole Heart is not Divorced from all things el&s;e, &amp; turned to God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us. There is no Effectual Change in the Soul; but the Rock is unbroken the thorn un&s;tubbed up: Men Sow among Thorns; and hence the Fruit is choaked. And thus we have Di&s;covered,
<PB N="24" REF="001527_0029_0FB39DF080E8C5D8">
what Sorts of Faith are not Saving and Effectual.</P>
<P N="4">IV. <HI>We may Enquire into the Flaws and Defects of Faith: whence it Proves Ineffectual and Un&s;ound</HI>?</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>When the Object of Faith is not Rightly under&s;tood and di&s;cerned.</HI> This Defect is &s;uch a Flaw, as Renders the Faith of &s;uch of none Effect: and here many mi&s;s it in Point of Salvation: thus it was with many in the Go&s;pel, that followed Chri&s;t and did indeed Believe, that he was the Me&s;&s;iah; they want|ed a right under&s;tanding of Chri&s;t the Ob|ject of Faith, whom they were to clo&s;e with|all: So they, <HI>Joh.</HI> 6.14.15. They dream|ed of a Temporal Kingdom and a Temporal Advantage and Pomp, to come by the Me&s;&s;i|ah, which was the Common Errour of the Iews at that Time: They Embraced him, as a Worker of Miracles, by whom his Follow|ers might have Glory and Honour, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But they did not under&s;tand the Spiritual Office of Chri&s;t; nor did they look at the Spiritu|al Ble&s;&s;ings to be had by him: They Mi&s;took the Per&s;on, they Believed on; or at lea&s;t were not duly Informed concerning him out of the Word; and &s;o were not well Ground|ed
<PB N="25" REF="001527_0030_0FB39DF2413F9868">
either in the Knowledge of the Object, or the Word of Faith. The&s;e Defects and Flaws Spoil'd all: Their Faith was not right|ly &s;et upon the True Object.</P>
<P N="2">2. A Second Flaw and Defect in Faith, that makes it un&s;ound and ineffectual, is <HI>The want of an Inward Spiritual Work of Humi|liation and Regeneration.</HI> When Per&s;ons are &s;trangers to Inward Regenerating Grace and change of Heart; then they are &s;trangers to Saving Faith. Whatever other Qualificati|ons and Excellencies they may Pretend to, Relating to the Knowledge of the Object of Faith, Eminency of Gifts, Parts, Place or whatever; yet without Inward Regenerating Grace, wrought by the Spirit, cau&s;ing a Change of Heart; no Saving Faith. We have an In&s;tance of this in Nicodemus, <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.1&mdash;10. He was a man in Place, a Phari&s;ee, a Ruler of the Jews, One that was a Follower of Chri&s;t, an admirer of him: <HI>Rabbi</HI> (&s;aith he) <HI>We know that thou art a Teacher, Sent from God. v.</HI> 2. He had a Re&s;pect for Chri&s;t; and hence Chri&s;t falls upon him with that, in the fir&s;t Place, <HI>v.</HI> 3. <HI>Except a man be born again, he cannot &s;ee the Kingdom of God,</HI> i. e. Thou art taken with the Miracles; and give&s;t me
<PB N="26" REF="001527_0031_0FB39DF370CAC8A0">
Honourable Titles; and ha&s;t &s;ome Good general Affections; yea but thou wante&s;t &s;till a Work of Regeneration, a new Birth, a Change of Heart and State, a Spiritual Work of Grace Soaking into the whole Heart, and making the Frame thereof new: without this thou can&s;t never come to Heaven. Do not think, that a General Hi&s;torical Faith or &s;ome general Good Affections will &s;erve without Regeneration: And hence al&s;o &s;uch want the Preparatory work of Sound Humi|liation, in order to Saving Faith. Such have not the Fallow Ground broken up; nor are they Broken off from their Sins and Selves: they yet remain like the Stony Ground: the rock at the Bottom remains &s;till.</P>
<P N="3">3. A Third Flaw and Defect, rendering Faith Ineffectual, is, <HI>Not coming up to the Go&s;pel Terms of Effectual Faith.</HI> Not comply|ing with the Go&s;pel Conditions of clo&s;ing with Chri&s;t; Renouncing and For&s;aking all other things, and Following Chri&s;t with the Cro&s;s on our Backs; not getting over the Stumbling-Blocks of the World, <HI>viz.</HI> Worldly Honours, Plea&s;ures, Profits; So as to part with all for Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>This was the fault Chri&s;t found with many
<PB N="27" REF="001527_0032_0FB39DF68B933220">
Followers of him, and &s;eeming Believers on him: Thus <HI>Nicodemus came by night,</HI> for fear of the Jews, and as a&s;hamed to be Known to Own Chri&s;t: He was not got over the Blocks of Carnal Fear and Worldly Honour: So they, <HI>Joh.</HI> 12.42, 43. <HI>Among the Chief Ru|lers, many Believed on him; but did not con|fe&s;s him, lea&s;t they &s;hould be Put out of the Synagogue: for they loved the Prai&s;e of men more than the Prai&s;e of God.</HI></P>
<P>The Terms of Saving Faith propounded are to for&s;ake <HI>All</HI> to Follow Chri&s;t, to Re|nounce Sin, Self, &amp; World, <HI>Matt.</HI> 14.26, 27, 33. The Stony Ground in the Text, fell away in Time of Temptation. The Faith of mo&s;t can hardly comply with Go&s;pel Propo&s;als: the Terms Propo&s;ed are not agreeable to their Di&s;po&s;itions and Affections: Hence&punc; their Faith fails them: In the Hour of Temptati|on they fall away.</P>
<P N="4">4. A Fourth Defect and Flaw in Faith a|ri&s;eth from the <HI>Fal&s;ene&s;s and Hypocri&s;y of the Heart.</HI> Men Believe; but not with the whole Heart. This God calls for, <HI>The Heart</HI>: and this is a mark of true Faith, <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.10. <HI>For with the Heart man Believeth unto Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s</HI>: Upon this Flaw and Defect we may
<PB N="28" REF="001527_0033_0FB39DF8099041E8">
ground the main Rea&s;on for the confirmation of the Doctrine, <HI>viz.</HI> Why there is a Belie|ving that is not Saving; and &s;o, Why there are many Believers that &s;hall never be Saved.</P>
<P><HI>Becau&s;e God accepts of no Faith as Saving, but only that, which is with all the Heart.</HI> That which carries the whole Soul with it; that whereby a Man doth embrace whole Chri&s;t, according to the Terms of the Go&s;pel, with an whole Heart; that, that infers a change of Heart, that carries with it a New Heart, and a New Spirit. But now there may be &s;ome kind of Believing, and yet not come thus far.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Becau&s;e of the Deceitfulne&s;s of the Heart.</HI> There is &s;uch cunning and guile in the Heart, that it will <HI>&s;eem</HI> to Do &s;ome things; <HI>&s;eem</HI> to Believe, and yet not believe indeed; act a part upon the Stage of Profe&s;&s;ion; and yet hide and keep its Sin: yea not only deceiv|ing others, but a Man's Self, by its fair pre|tences and partial comings off.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Becau&s;e of the &s;trong and deep-rooted En|mity of the Heart again&s;t God and Chri&s;t, which is not over-come and &s;ubdued by lighter Impre&s;&s;i|ons</HI>: Nor when there is &s;ome Temporary good Affection towards Chri&s;t. The heart
<PB N="29" REF="001527_0034_0FB39DF97730D090">
may yield a little, and yet not be changed from its enmity and oppo&s;ition to all that is Holy.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Becau&s;e of the Inability of Nature to put forth the Supernatural act of Faith, without the Mighty Power of the Spirit, to cau&s;e it &s;o to do.</HI> It is above the Power of Nature, (yea tho' a&s;&s;i&s;ted with the common workings, lighter impre&s;&s;ions, &s;trivings and motions of the Spi|rit) to put forth &s;uch an act as Saving Faith is: Joh. 6.65. <HI>No man can come unto me, Except it were given unto him of my Father.</HI></P>
<P N="5">V. <HI>We now Proceed to lay down the Signs of an Un&s;ound, and the Nature of Sound and Saving Faith.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. An Un&s;ound Faith may be Di&s;covered by the&s;e Signs; which may have &s;ome re|ference to what hath been Premi&s;ed.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That Faith is Unfound, that is without Previous Humiliation.</HI> A &s;udden Faith and Joy, without Humiliation, without breaking of the heart <HI>for,</HI> and <HI>from</HI> Sin: Such was the Faith of the Stony Ground in our Text; it had no depth: the Rock at the bottom was never broken and di&s;&s;olved. Con&s;ider, if thy Faith hath been but a &s;uddain pang of
<PB N="30" REF="001527_0035_0FB39DFB06665DE0">
Affection in Hearing the Word, without Con|viction, &s;ight and &s;en&s;e of Sin and Wrath, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Such &s;light Faith is not to be re&s;ted in. When a Man on the &s;uddain, hearing of the Riches and Glory of Chri&s;t, is taken therewith; but never was Convinced of Sin; never &s;aw him|&s;elf in a peri&s;hing condition; never &s;tung with the fiery Serpent; never lo&s;t, poor, mi|&s;erable, blind, naked in thine own feeling, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Why this is a &s;hallow Faith, which a little heat of the Sun will wither away. Till a Man &s;ee Sin, as the greate&s;t Evil; he will never prize Chri&s;t, as the greate&s;t good.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That Faith is Un&s;ound, that doth not bring a Man to an ab&s;olute, pre&s;ent, preremptory con|&s;ent to take Chri&s;t, and give up him&s;elf wholly to Chri&s;t upon his own Terms.</HI> So it is with ma|ny; Chri&s;t makes his Motion, requires their Hearts, bids them renounce all other Lovers, and imbrace Him alone for ever; but when the Heart gives him good Words, and yet puts him off, and &s;aith, <HI>I will hereafter,</HI> at &s;uch a Time, <HI>I will con&s;ider of it</HI>; and &s;o continues Parlying &amp; Bartering with Chri&s;t; but comes not to an ab&s;olute Marriage con&s;ent, to part with all, and clo&s;e with him; this is a di&s;co|very of an Un&s;ound Heart. Why if there be
<PB N="31" REF="001527_0036_0FB39DFEF29BFE60">
not &s;uch a Faith as reacheth the proper Work of Faith, <HI>i. e.</HI> The ab&s;olute Taking and Re|ceiving Chri&s;t on his own Terms; then true|ly is here no effectual Faith, <HI>Luke</HI> 9.61. The Un&s;ound heart hath &s;till &s;ome-what to do, be|fore it will Follow Chri&s;t: it never comes to a pre&s;ent clo&s;ing with him.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>That Faith is not &s;ound, which is not &s;ee upon the Per&s;on of Chri&s;t, upon Chri&s;t Him&s;elf.</HI> To run away with the Word and Promi&s;e, and to mi&s;s of Chri&s;t him&s;elf, is a broken Faith, which will deceive. Saving Faith doth not only clo&s;e with a Truth or Propo&s;ition, but with a Per&s;on. Many, when they hear of the Word, the Promi&s;e, (viz. <HI>He that con|fe&s;&s;eth &amp; for&s;aketh, &s;hall find Mercy. He that hungers and thir&s;ts after Righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;hall be filled. He that Mourns is Ble&s;&s;ed,</HI> &amp;c.) Why they apply the Promi&s;e to them&s;elves, and be|lieve the Truth of it, and &s;o have Peace: Here they re&s;t, and here is all their Faith but to believe on Chri&s;t, and Match and Clo&s;e with the Per&s;on of Chri&s;t, this they are great Strangers to.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>That Believing that a Man has found Ea&s;y, which he could do and attain of him&s;elf, by his own Strength, that is Un&s;ound.</HI> Right
<PB N="32" REF="001527_0037_0FB39E0040C1AA20">
Faith is not of our &s;elves, <HI>Eph.</HI> 2.4. The Lord makes the Soul, on whom he works effectually, to feel that it is not of Him&s;elf, it is not in his own Power to Believe; it is a Supernatural Work (as we have heard.) If a Mans Faith be bred by Fle&s;h and Blood; by his own Will and Strength, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it is a ba&s;e, ba&s;tard Faith, and not begotten of the right Father, and therefore &s;hall never po&s;&s;e&s;s the Inheritance. If there hath not been a Super|natural Hand and Power on thy Heart, thou art in a State of Nature to this day.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>That Faith that doth not Separate and Di|vide a Man from every known Sin, and &s;et him upon a Warfare againct all Sin what&s;oever; that Faith is not Sound.</HI> Faith &s;o &s;eparate, I mean, as to make a Man willing to part with Sin, &amp; de&s;irous to improve all means again&s;t it.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>That Faith that is Barren &amp; Unfruitful, is an Un&s;ound Faith</HI>; that brings not forth Fruits of Grace and New Obedience in the Life, and Conver&s;ation.

all good Works; when there is no Working by Love. That is a fal&s;e Faith that is with|out Works, <HI>Jam.</HI> 2.14. 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.8, 9. And know for a certainty, that the Faith that never <HI>Sanctifies</HI> thee, will never <HI>Save</HI> thee in the Day of Je&s;us.</P>
<P N="2">2. The next Branch to be Enquired into&punc; is, <HI>The Nature of Sound &amp; Saving Faith.</HI> And I intend here, only &s;ome brief hints, both Negatively and Affirmatively; to &s;hew both what it is not, and what it is.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Negatively</HI>: Which may lead us to a right under&s;tanding of it, and the Premi&s;&s;es may be helpful herein.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Saving Faith is not a bare Knowledge of, or A&s;&s;ent to the Truth of the Scriptures</HI>; to believe the things that are written in the Law and Go&s;pel: tho' this mu&s;t be, but this is not Saving Faith, <HI>James</HI> 2.19. Neither is it the Truth of the Scripture only in general, but Chri&s;t Je&s;us, the Per&s;on of Chri&s;t, that is the Object of Saving, Ju&s;tifying Faith.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Neither is it the bare Believing of Chri&s;t, or of the Truth about the Doctrine of the Go&s;pel.</HI> Tho' this is nece&s;&s;ary; Rom. 10.14. <HI>How &s;hall they call on him, in whom they have not Believed? And how &s;hall they Believe in him
<PB N="34" REF="001527_0039_0FB39E036063DAD8">
of whom they have not heard?</HI> &amp;c. There cannot be believing <HI>on</HI> Chri&s;t, without Be|lieving <HI>of</HI> Him, without Knowledge and A&s;|&s;ent to the Truth concerning his Per&s;on, Offi|ces, Offers and Benefits. There mu&s;t be in all Adult Believers a competent Under&s;tand|ing of the&s;e Things, and A&s;&s;ent to them; this is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. True Faith is an Affiance grounded upon Knowledge: An un|known Chri&s;t cannot be Believed on, as, <HI>Act.</HI> 17.23. <HI>Paul</HI> found an Altar at <HI>Athens</HI> with this Super&s;cription: [<HI>To the Unknown God,</HI>] <HI>whom therefore</HI> (&s;aith he) <HI>ye ignorantly Wor|&s;hip.</HI> But this is not enough; to believe Chri&s;t and to believe on Chri&s;t are &s;everal things; the former is but the act of the Mind, the latter of the Will al&s;o, <HI>Joh.</HI> 5.40.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Nor is it an A&s;&s;urance or Settled per&s;wa|&s;ion of a Mans Intere&s;t in Chri&s;t, and of the Lords Everla&s;ting Love to him in Chri&s;t.</HI> Tho' this being rightly grounded is a Precious, &s;weet and comfortable thing; and true Faith ought to grow up to this. It is fearful Security for any to be at re&s;t without A&s;&s;urance; but yet this A&s;&s;urance is not the proper act of Saving, Ju&s;tifying Faith; but follows it, as pre&s;up|po&s;ing it: for there mu&s;t be Intere&s;t in Chri&s;t,
<PB N="35" REF="001527_0040_0FB39E06B4D60BF8">
in order of Nature, before there can be A&s;|&s;urance of it; and there mu&s;t be Saving Faith, before Intere&s;t, 1 <HI>Job.</HI> 5.13. <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.1. <HI>There|fore, being ju&s;tified by Faith, we have Peace with God, through our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>But,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Affirmatively.</HI> To &s;peak Po&s;itively, What this &s;ound and effectual Faith is, that is the condition, upon which Salvation is Pro|mi&s;ed in the Go&s;pel. Not to enter into any large or full Di&s;cour&s;e. In Sum, you may take up this De&s;cription of it.</P>
<P>De&s;cirp. <HI>Saving Faith is a Saving Grace of the Spirit, whereby we Receive and Re&s;t upon Chri&s;t Je&s;us, for Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Life.</HI></P>
<P>Or more fully.</P>
<P>Effectual Faith or Believing, Is when a Soul, feeling its Sinful and Peri&s;hing condi|tion, receiveth Chri&s;t, as he is freely offered in the Go&s;pel, re&s;teth on him, as an Al&s;uffi|cient Saviour for Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Life.</P>
<P>This &s;ets forth the Nature of Saving Faith, whereby an humbled Sinner, being per&s;waded of, and a&s;&s;enting to the Truth of the Go&s;pel, and Chri&s;t revealed therein; he doth heartily embrace and re&s;t on Him for Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Salvation. But the Nature of Saving
<PB N="36" REF="001527_0041_0FB39E090511F558">
Faith may be more familiarly &s;et forth, by the e&s;&s;ential requi&s;ites comprized in the De|&s;cription.</P>
<P>There are four e&s;&s;ential requi&s;ites, that go to the con&s;titution of Saving Faith. There mu&s;t be, (1) An humbling &s;ight and &s;en&s;e of Sin, and Mi&s;ery by Sin. (2) A &s;ight of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, revealed and freely offered in the Go&s;pel. (3) An embracing and receiving Chri&s;t thus offered. (4) A re&s;ting and re|lying upon him for Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Life.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>There mu&s;t be an Humbling &s;ight &amp; &s;en&s;e of Sin.</HI> This Humiliation (or &s;en&s;iblene&s;s of Sin) whether you call it a part of Faith, taken largely; or a preparation for Faith, taken &s;trictly: to be &s;ure it is a nece&s;&s;ary re|qui&s;ite unto Believing. It is the humble Pub|lican that comes to Chri&s;t for Mercy in ear|ne&s;t, <HI>Luk.</HI> 18.13, 14. Faith &amp; flying to Chri&s;t, the City of Refuge, is but a Notion to the &s;e|cure and unhumbled. In believing there is, <HI>A flying for Refuge and Help to Chri&s;t</HI>; and implies &s;en&s;e of evil and danger. There is an hearty embracing of a Remedy, that pre&s;up|po&s;eth hearty &s;en&s;e of a di&s;ea&s;e. It was the bitten I&s;raelite that looked to the brazen Ser|pent. It is the &s;tung and wounded Sinner,
<PB N="37" REF="001527_0042_0FB39E0A05B4EC18">
that will look in earne&s;t to Chri&s;t Je&s;us, <HI>Mat.</HI> 9.12, 13. <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 61.1, 2, 3. There mu&s;t be a clo&s;ing with a Saviour from Sin, as <HI>Precious,</HI> 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.7. That implies, that Sin is appre|hended to be bitter: The Soul mu&s;t be ap|prehen&s;ive, that it is Peri&s;hing; thy Peri&s;hing condition mu&s;t be felt: there mu&s;t be a &s;en&s;e and feeling thereof; as the fami&s;hing man feels what it is to be hungry: the man that is in danger of his Life, feels what it is to cry out for help: the &s;ick man feels what it is to need and prize the Phy&s;ician. Oh! was thy heart ever wounded for Sin and made &s;ick of it? Did the Lord ever awaken thee by his Word, not only to Dream of a Natural E&s;tate; but to &s;ee it; to &s;ee thy &s;elf a dead man, un|der the Power and Guilt of Sin, under the &s;trength of the cur&s;e, <HI>Rom.</HI> 7.9. Has the Spi|rit convinced thee of Sin? That is the fir&s;t &s;tep in order to the Working of Saving Faith, <HI>Job.</HI> 16.9.</P>
<P N="2">2. A Second requi&s;ite of Saving Faith, is, <HI>The &s;ight of the Object, a &s;ight of Je&s;us Chri&s;t revealed and freely offered and held forth in the Go&s;pel.</HI> And this revelation and offer, it mu&s;t be entertained with an under&s;tanding &amp; a&s;&s;en|ting to the Truths revealed. There is in
<PB N="38" REF="001527_0043_0FB39E0B73A223C0">
Faith (or goes to the making up of Faith) <HI>Knowledge, A&s;&s;ent,</HI> and <HI>Affiance</HI>; the former of the&s;e cannot be without the revelation of the object; and the two latter cannot be without the former. There mu&s;t be a revelation of a Chri&s;t, and a &s;ight of Chri&s;t in the under&s;tand|ing, in order to the clo&s;ing with him by the Will: Joh. 6.40. <HI>This is the Will of him that &s;ent me. Every one that &s;eeth the Son and be|lieveth on him, may have everla&s;ting Life</HI>: &mdash; and this &s;ight is both by Knowledge and Un|der&s;tanding of the doctrine of Chri&s;t, and by a&s;&s;ent thereunto, or being per&s;waded of the truth thereof, which precedes embracing, <HI>Heb.</HI> 11.13. <HI>Joh.</HI> 20.31.</P>
<P>Make not a light matter of the revelation and offer of Chri&s;t in the Go&s;pel: it is e&s;&s;en|tially requi&s;ite to Saving Faith. In the day of Grace when the Spirit, by its powerful o|perations, works Saving Faith in the Soul; it doth it by opening the eyes of the under&s;tand|ing, to &s;ee Chri&s;t revealed and freely offered in the Go&s;pel, and letting in the &s;weetne&s;s and &s;avour of it to the Heart and Will; <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.17. <HI>&amp;</HI> 1.16, 17. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.18. It is po&s;&s;i|ble indeed that a man may have the revela|tion of Chri&s;t in the Go&s;pel, and &s;ome real
<PB N="39" REF="001527_0044_0FB39E0CFA797798">
&s;ight of the things of Chri&s;t; and yet not &s;a|vingly embrace them; as in tho&s;e that are en|lightned, and yet fall away, <HI>Heb.</HI> 6.4. <HI>&amp;</HI> 10.26. And tho&s;e, in our text, <HI>Who for a while Believe.</HI> There is &s;ome revelation, &s;ome light, &s;ome knowledge; but ordinarily and u&s;ually men that live in unbelief, they are Defective in knowledge of what is revealed in the Go&s;|pel, concerning the object of Faith; or at lea&s;t in a&s;&s;ent to what is revealed; e&s;pecially this latter; but Chri&s;t, as an All-&s;ufficient Sa|viour, with his Redemption, Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Benefits, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> revealed in the Go&s;pel and free|ly offered and held forth; is the ground of our Believing or clo&s;ing with him by Faith.</P>
<P N="3">3. A third e&s;&s;ential requi&s;ite of Saving Faith, is, <HI>The Souls embracing and receiving Chri&s;t, thus revealed and offered, even the Per&s;on of Chri&s;t, Chri&s;t him&s;elf.</HI> God holds forth his Son, and the Soul takes him; that is Faith, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.17. Faith it is the Souls embracing,&mdash; receiving, re&s;ting relying on, tru&s;ting in Chri&s;t, as re|vealed and offered in the Go&s;pel. This ex|pre&s;&s;eth that <HI>Fiducia</HI> or Affiance, which is the main or mo&s;t formal act and nature of Saving Faith. The&s;e terms expre&s;s the formal and fiducial act of Faith, re&s;ting on Chri&s;t or tru&s;t|ing
<PB N="40" REF="001527_0045_0FB39E0FF4CEB510">
in him; this is the formal nature of Faith: hence it is not only to believe Chri&s;t; but to believe on Chri&s;t: hence believing is oft ex|pounded by tru&s;ting (as, <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.12. <HI>Matt.</HI> 12.21.) and that imports the&s;e three actings of Faith.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>A rolling and ca&s;ting our &s;elves upon Chri&s;t, having no other bottom to &s;tand on, and &s;eeing with him a Rock able to bear us, and Arms open to receive us.</HI> Now we throw our &s;elves &amp; our whole weight upon him, and fall into his Arms, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 37.7. <HI>&amp;</HI> 55.22 <HI>Ca&s;t thy burthen upon the Lord, and he &s;hall &s;u&s;tain thee.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>A &s;taying, hanging, leaning, depending upon him,</HI> I&s;ai. 50.10. <HI>Who is among you, that walketh in darkne&s;s and hath no light; let him tru&s;t in the Name of the Lord, &amp; &s;tay upon his God.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>An Acquie&s;cence in Chri&s;t</HI>; a re&s;ting of the heart in him (as well as on him) as be|lieving that he is al&s;o able (as well as faithful) to be and do that which we depend upon him for. And now being come to the Rock of Ages &amp; built upon it; having committed our &s;elves to Chri&s;t, embracing him, and relying on him; now we re&s;t there, as in One, in whom there is good enough to &s;atisfy us, and power e|nough to help us and &s;ave us; and who is
<PB N="41" REF="001527_0046_0FB39E1233060EB8">
faithful to fulfill what he hath promi&s;ed. The &s;oul &s;eeth him able enough to &s;u&s;tain him, a rock and bottom &s;trong enough to bear him: he &s;ees his arms long enough to reach, &s;trong enough to hold him; ready enough to embrace him: hence he ca&s;ts and throws him&s;elf there|into, and &s;eeing no help nor hope in him&s;elf; no ability at all to &s;ave &amp; deliver; and &s;eeing Chri&s;t able, mighty, faithful, willing to help, every way All-&s;ufficient: hence the Soul finds in him an everla&s;ting foundation; a rock fit to &s;tay on; hence it lets all other hopes and &s;tays go; and re&s;ts and tru&s;ts here for ever.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Faith is a re&s;ting and relying on Chri&s;t for righteou&s;ne&s;s and life</HI>; for righteou&s;ne&s;s unto ju&s;tification, <HI>Rom,</HI> 5.17. <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 45.24. <HI>In the Lord have I righteou&s;ne&s;s and &s;trength.</HI> We do not only want power from Chri&s;t to help us; but righteou&s;ne&s;s to be the matter of our Ju&s;tification; the foundation and ground of our whole Salvation; for that is the inlet of Life eternal. In acting of Faith the Soul comes in &s;pecial to Chri&s;t for Righteou&s;ne&s;s: Rom. 10.4, 10. <HI>For Chri&s;t is the End of the Law for righteou&s;ne&s;s, to every one that believ|eth.</HI> And Faith looks to Chri&s;t, as for impu|ted Righteou&s;ne&s;s unto Ju&s;tification; &s;o al&s;o
<PB N="42" REF="001527_0047_0FB39E13B2EF0060">
for inherent Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Life in Sancti|fication: And hence Faith is a relying on Chri&s;t for Life; Spiritual Life began in the Grace of Sanctification here, and compleated in the perfection of Glory hereafter.</P>
<P>Thus you have the e&s;&s;ential requi&s;ites of Saving Faith, &s;etting forth the formal Nature of it, which few attain unto. The truth is, Mo&s;t Profe&s;&s;ors content them&s;elves with a fal&s;e Ineffectual Faith, like the Temporaries in the Text, <HI>Who for a while believe, and in Time of Temptation fall away</HI>: Or as others, who at la&s;t mi&s;s of Heaven in the height of their hopes, being mi&s;taken as to the grounds of their Faith not well rooted. It is not every Faith, that is Saving; nor every Believer that &s;hall be Saved; nor every one that Crys, <HI>Lord, Lord, that &s;hall enter into the Kingdom.</HI> The Way through Faith to Salvation is a difficult Way to hit, and dangerous to mi&s;s; and Mul|titudes mi&s;carry, even many of tho&s;e that are Believers, who &s;hall never be Saved.</P>

Thou art ready to drop into Hell every moment: Devils are Preying upon thy Soul: The Shackles of Sins and Lu&s;ts, the Chains of Darkne&s;s, the Bolts &amp; Irons of a Blind Mind &amp; Hard Heart are upon them. Thou art &s;inking in the Seas of the Wrath of God; and at pre&s;ent thou ha&s;t no hold of any thing, that can Save thee: &s;o

that thy Pre&s;ent &s;tate is Doleful, and not to be Re&s;ted in.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Thou knowe&s;t not whether thou &s;halt have much, or any time more to attain Saving Faith in.</HI> Thy pre&s;ent &s;tate is certainly Mi&s;erable; but thy future time to e&s;cape it, is Uncertain. Oh! The &s;topping of time Ears to Day, may be thy Undoing for ever. Thou lotte&s;t upon more time; but rememember, Luk. 12.20. <HI>Thou Fool, this Night &s;hall thy Soul be required of thee.</HI> And remember the Advice of our Sa|viour, Ver. 40. <HI>Be ye therefore Ready; for the Son of Man cometh at an Hour when ye think not.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Remember Faith is not in thine own Power, Eph.</HI> 2.8. It mu&s;t be the Operation of the Mighty God: Father, Son, and Holy Gho&s;t mu&s;t come into thy Soul, and put forth an Al|mighty Power there, if ever &s;aving Faith be wrought in thee: And thou that receive&s;t this Grace in vain now; how can&s;t thou expect, that he &s;hould do any &s;uch thing for thee here|after?</P>

E&s;tranged, and Satan hath the more Hold of thee. But thus &s;ee the Mi&s;ery and Danger of a &s;tate of Unbelief.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>See the Sin and Sinfulne&s;s of &s;uch a &s;tate.</HI> Un&s;peakable is the Sin, that the Unbeliever lies under: All Sin lives and reigns, where Unbelief lives and reigns; for now the Cur&s;e reigns in its &s;trength, and &s;in hath dominion, <HI>Rom.</HI> 6.14. A man is in his &s;ins &s;till, if not in Chri&s;t by Faith. Faith flies to a Saviour for deliverance from &s;in; but Unbelief de&s;pi&s;eth a Saviour, and chu&s;eth to live in &s;in. Unbe|lief in its own Nature, is an exceeding great &s;in: A de&s;pi&s;ing of God, when he tenders the greate&s;t Gift of his Love, his only Begotten Son; when he offers Him&s;elf and his Grace upon the &s;weete&s;t and ea&s;ie&s;t Terms. Oh! This &s;in of Unbelief, it is a Damning &s;in. And if we Enquire, <HI>Who they are, that are guilty here; and in a &s;tate of Unbelief:</HI> For we &s;ee all men have not Faith. Briefly to &s;ingle out &s;uch.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>They that have no Acquaintance with Chri&s;t, but are utter Strangers to him; either gro&s;ly Ig|norant, or utterly Negligent of Him.</HI> Where there is Faith, it brings the Soul acquainted with Chri&s;t: but there are, that live under the
<PB N="67" REF="001527_0072_0FB39EBC81F7F3B8">
Means and Mini&s;try of the Word, that are utter &s;trangers to Chri&s;t, as to any di&s;tinct Knowledge of him. Chri&s;t is but a general Name, an empty Sound in their Ears: The&s;e are in their Unbelief: <HI>The god of this world having blinded the minds of them that Believe not,</HI> 2 Cor. 4.4.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>They who&s;e Hearts were never yet Broken &amp; Humbled.</HI> Faith grows in a contrite Soul; and not upon a Rock. The &s;tony Ground, where the Heart is an unbroken Stone, and hath no depth of &s;oft Earth, it will not bear the good Grain of effectual &s;aving Faith. And how many Rocks are there, that were never Broken; hearts of Stone, never turned to Fle&s;h: to whom Sin was never bitter, nor Wrath terrible, nor Chri&s;t &s;weet.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>They that allow them&s;elves in any known Sin,</HI> 2 Tim. 2.19. They that have &s;ound &amp; &s;aving Faith, do faithfully maintain a War again&s;t Sin, as Sin; and &s;o again&s;t <HI>All Sin.</HI> It is o|therwi&s;e with the Unbeliever, he knows there is &s;ome &s;weet &s;in, &s;ome &s;ecret &s;in that he &s;pares and loves and will not for&s;ake. To go on boldly, carele&s;ly and impenitently in any Known Sin, is incon&s;i&s;tent with effectual Faith in Chri&s;t, and with that Regeneration
