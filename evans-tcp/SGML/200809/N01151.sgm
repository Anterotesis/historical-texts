<P>CHRIST JESUS in this Sermon upon the Mount, having given ma|ny Divine Rules &amp; Coun&s;els, doth here in the clo&s;e of that Di&s;cour&s;e, give an account of two &s;orts of Hearers that were pre&s;ent: The fir&s;t &s;ort he commends, He compares <HI>them to a wi&s;e man that built his hou&s;e upon a Rock,</HI> v. 24, 25.

to the Word, but do not live according|ly; they li&s;ten to Temptation, and do not what they are Commanded; they forbear not what they are forbidden: They plea&s;e their Curio&s;ity by hearing; they give them&s;elves a diver&s;ion from their Labours, they fill their Heads with Knowledge, they get E&s;timation, but they do not put what they hear in practi&s;e; there be few but do &s;ome things, but the&s;e don't yield Univer&s;al Obedience to Chri&s;t. (2.) The cen|&s;ure that he pa&s;&s;es upon them, he re&s;embles them to <HI>a Fooli&s;h man that builds his hou&s;e upon the Sand.</HI> They act imprudently for them&s;elves, they are like a man that builds his hou&s;e upon a movea+ble foundation, which will not &s;tand when the Torrent comes, and the Winds blow: So the&s;e men build their hopes for Heaven, upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> foundation that will fail them.</P>

are built upon grounds that will utterly fail them. Hopes of Salvation are no evidence that men are in a good condition; men had need examine the foundation of their Hope. It would be well for &s;ome Profe&s;&s;ors, if their hopes were converted into fears: They meerly cheat them&s;elves by nouri&s;hing &s;uch hopes. Some Profe&s;&s;ors are much put to it to get and keep an Hope for Salvation, and when they have got it, it is good for nothing: Many Profe&s;&s;ors are carele&s;s and pre&s;umptuous, and take up with &s;uch hopes as will utterly deceive them: <HI>Job</HI> 8.13, 14. <HI>The Hypocrites hope &s;hall peri&s;h, who&s;e hope &s;hall be cut off, and who&s;e tru&s;t &s;hall be a Spiders web.</HI> Job. 27.8. <HI>What is the hope of the Hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God &s;hall take away his Soul?</HI> Rev. 3.17. <HI>Thou &s;aye&s;t thou art rich and increa&s;ed in goods and ha&s;t need of nothing, and knowe&s;t not that thou art wretched and mi&s;erable, and poor &amp; blind and naked.</HI></P>
<P>Here I &s;hall an&s;wer two Enquiries.</P>

&s;everal mi&s;takes about mens believing in Chri&s;t: &s;ome men take that for believing, which is not believing. Some men take encouragement from their own Righteou&s;ne&s;s to tru&s;t in Chri&s;t, and they call that Faith: but men may know that they do believe. Faith in Chri&s;t is a thing that may clearly be di&s;cerned and under&s;tood; faith is &s;ometimes very vi&s;ible: and when it is &s;een, men may a&s;&s;uredly gather, that God will be&s;tow eternal Life upon them: they have no rea&s;on to be afraid though they have a great many Infirmities: but they may conclude upon the Pardon of their Sins, &amp; everla&s;ting Life. Faith is like the Sword of <HI>Saul,</HI> &amp; Bow of <HI>Jonathan,</HI> it never fails of bringing men to Salvation: 1 Pet. 1.9. <HI>Receiving the end of your Faith even the Sal|vation of your Souls:</HI> Rom. 15.13. <HI>The God of hope fill you with all joy &amp; peace in believing.</HI></P>

The mi&s;take of &s;ome others does ari&s;e from Ignorance of the Working of their own hearts. They have a right notion of the nature of faith, but they do not di&s;cern their own hearts: they think, they come to Chri&s;t upon the meer en|couragement of his Righteou&s;ne&s;s; but indeed they take only part of their encouragement from thence; the fir&s;t ground of their encourage|ment is their own Sorrow, their de&s;ires, their love to the People of God: yet they take in the Plea of the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t. This makes the Apo&s;tle &s;peak as he doth: Rom. 11.6. <HI>If it be of Grace, it is no more of works, otherwi&s;e Grace is no more Grace; but if it be of works, it is no more Grace, otherwi&s;e work is no more work.</HI></P>

Now they are more accurate in &s;earching them&s;elves, they cannot &s;atisfy them|&s;elves with &s;mall appearances, and &s;lender grounds of comfort; and &s;ometimes they plain|ly di&s;cern that their hopes were delu&s;ions, that they have mi&s;erably cheated them&s;elves, that their Religion has been nothing el&s;e but For|mality. I have heard a dying Profe&s;&s;or bitterly bewail the want of Sincerity. Then men will con&s;ider more thorowly after what manner they have lived.

If carnal men go out of the World with great hopes, their hopes will vani&s;h in a Moment; when they are dead, their hopes will be as the giving up of the gho&s;t.

<HEAD>Here con&s;ider two things.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. <HI>You may deceive men, but not</HI> GOD. Men that have not a &s;park of Grace in their hearts may carry it &s;o, that men may take them for very holy men: They talk Religiou&s;ly, ab&s;tain from vicious cour&s;es, have an orderly and religious

Conver&s;ation, and &s;o they may pa&s;s currently among men for Godly men; and live Twenty or Thirty years in good Reputation: Men do not di&s;cern what their ends be, what their Spi|rit is, nor tho&s;e Secret practi&s;es that they are guilty of. Men may have blemi&s;hes on their bodies, and others know nothing of them: Men may be very poor and others not know it: So men may be Spiritually blind &amp; dead, and others be ignorant of it: but there is no hiding of the thing from God; the hearts of men are un|der his eye; God has a Window into every mans heart: Men may cheat other men; but they cannot cheat God. Men don't know the thoughts of Gods heart any further than he reveals them, but God knows their hearts; neither the Spirituality of the Soul, nor the darkne&s;s of the Night; nor the fal&s;e &s;hews that men make, can be a cover to hide the heart from God: all thoughts, de&s;ires, purpo&s;es and ends are open unto God: God &s;eeth not as man &s;eeth: Jer. 17.10. <HI>I the Lord &s;earch the heart and try the reins, to render to every man ac|cording to his works&punc;</HI> though the heart is very deceitful, yet it is not &s;o deceitful as to deceive GOD.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>You may deceive your &s;elves, but not</HI> GOD. Many Per&s;ons have deceived them&s;elves: Men often take that for Silver that is not Silver, and

that for Grace which is not: the difference is narrow between true Faith and common Faith, between &s;aving Love and common affection, between Godly &s;orrow and legal &s;orrow, be|tween Godly zeal and common zeal. Some|times men do not &s;earch accurately, &s;ometimes their common affections work &s;o high, that they carry a mighty re&s;emblance of Grace; and men are naturally inclined to have a fa|vourable Opinion of them&s;elves, and pronounce a Sentence of ju&s;tification on them&s;elves, with|out &s;ufficient grounds: Men are acquitted in the Court of Con&s;cience, without &s;ufficient cau&s;e: but they cannot deceive God, He &s;ees thorow all &s;hews and pretences, and can di&s;tin|gui&s;h between the &s;ub&s;tance and the &s;hadow&punc; God is better acquainted with men, than men are with them&s;elves: P&s;al. 139.2. <HI>Thou under|&s;tande&s;t my thought afar off.</HI></P>

<P><HI>That you don't build your hopes upon a &s;andy foun|dation.</HI> He is <HI>a fooli&s;h man that builds his hou&s;e upon the Sand,</HI> Mat. 7.26.

If the de&s;ign of men be Salvation, the&s;e hopes will be an hindrance to them, it is better a great deal to be without hopes, than to have hopes built upon the Sand.

</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="application">
<HEAD>I &s;hall apply this Warning particularly.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. <HI>To Ignorant Profe&s;&s;ors.</HI> When Ignorant Per&s;ons have a ca&s;e depending in the Law, it is an ea&s;y thing for a crafty Fellow to make them believe that their ca&s;e is good: So Satan has great advantage on Ignorant Profe&s;&s;ors; blind men may ea&s;ily be led into the ditch. Some men be Ignorant which be certain &s;igns, and which be uncertain; they are likely to de|pend upon tho&s;e that are uncertain. Some men cannot tell wherein the Nature of true Faith doth lye, neither are they able to di&s;tin|gui&s;h common from Saving Grace; &s;uch are in great danger to be impo&s;ed on; Ignorant men are in the next preparation to be deceived: The darkne&s;s of the mind expo&s;es them; it is ea&s;y to <HI>deceive the &s;imple,</HI> Rom. 16.18. Men

that do not know Silver, may ea&s;ily be cheated about it. Men that are ignorant of the Law, are not fit to be Judges. Ignorance makes men bold to continue in dangerous ways. It is &s;trange that knowing Per&s;ons &s;hould continue in dangerous ways, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.9. but 'tis not &s;trange to &s;ee Ignorant People continue in &s;uch wayes.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>To &s;uch as have not had a di&s;tinct work of Conver&s;ion.</HI> Some men have had a very accu|rate and di&s;tinct work of Conver&s;ion, they have been plainly led along from &s;tep to &s;tep, and have been clearly brought home to CHRIST: but there be &s;ome others with whom the ca&s;e is otherwi&s;e, they pretend to be Saints, but they give a mi&s;erable account of their Conver|&s;ion: Some of them may be Converted, but many of them are not: ordinarily if men be Converted they know more about it: for Con|&s;cience is a great ob&s;erver of mens behaviour, and &s;uch men are in great hazard to build up|on the Sand: It is po&s;&s;ible for them to attain to a certainty: Joh. 9.25. <HI>One thing I know, that whereas I was blind, now I &s;ee.</HI> But many &s;uch Per&s;ons do deceive them&s;elves, their arguments for a Converted condition are far &s;hort of a demon&s;tration.</P>
