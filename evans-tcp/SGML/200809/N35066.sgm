<P>TO the benign and God loving Reader or Hear|er who might &s;ee this, and to you my dear Friends, wi&s;hing from my heart, that each who &s;hould read this, to give ear to it with an impartial heart and mind it. This Treati&s;e, which I have drawn in my &s;implene&s;s, treating in the fir&s;t place of the written Word of GOD, again&s;t all tho&s;e, who reject the old and new Te&s;tament, or do not con|fe&s;s it to be the word of the Almighty, which was received and confe&s;&s;ed from all ages, by all holy men and children of God, to be the true and everla&s;ting Word; which word as our Saviour &s;ays, will judge us in the la&s;t day.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friends and Readers,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>LOVING you with a divine love, I wi&s;h you and me and to all mankind, that the eternal creator and pre&s;erver of all things, may pour out his fatherly &s;pirit over us all, that we poor &s;heep who go a&s;tray in the wilderne&s;s of this world, may be led and guided by him, to the excellent pa&s;ture of his word, and to be fed with the true bread of life, that our &s;ouls may live. But perceiving from your Publications, that you Quakers, (for con&s;cience|&s;ake, or your con&s;ciences being &s;o delicate) do not confe&s;s the books of the written word, to be the word of God. Therefore, I would give you to un|der&s;tand by this my &s;imple epi&s;tle, &s;ince I confe&s;s it to be the true word of God; as I hope to &s;hew by the divine grace, be&s;eeching each and every one of my readers, that they might read this with an impar|tial heart, and to weigh it on the balance of the word of God, and on the te&s;timony of the Prophets, Je|&s;us Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles, who have made us known the will of the Almighty, whether it is incon&s;i&s;tent with holy writ. Hear and under&s;tand, you who think your con&s;ciences to be &s;o tender, that you would not take the written word, which you call the holy Writ, for the word of God. Therefore dear friends give ear, what the man of faith Mo&s;es has &s;poken from the mouth of the Almighty, who has made heaven and earth, and all that is in it, when he begins thus:&mdash;<HI>In the beginning</HI> God <HI>created the heaven and earth. And the earth was without form, and void; and darkne&s;s was upon the face of the deep: <PB N="5" REF="045885_0005_10207B01D136DC40">and the &s;pirit of</HI> God <HI>moved upon the face of the waters,</HI> Gene&s;is 1, 1. 2. Here my dear friends you may hear, and God &s;aid, ah! dear-bought &s;ouls, what was it that the Almighty &s;aid? He the eternal crea|tor and builder of all things, has &s;aid, "Let there be light:" and there was light; from whom came the written and conceiving word, mu&s;t we poor creatures not all confe&s;s with Mo&s;es, that it was &s;pok|en by the Almighty, as king David confe&s;&s;es in his XXXIII. <HI>P&s;alm,</HI> 6 ver&s;e. <HI>By the word of the Lord was the heavens made: and all the ho&s;t of them by the breath of his mouth.</HI> Hear farther, what the creator of all things has &s;poken, "Let there be a firmament in the mid&s;t of the waters, and let it divide the wa|ters from the waters," who&s;e word was it, that came from the eternal creator, whereby he has made all things? I hope we mu&s;t confe&s;s with all &s;aints, that it is the eternal word of the Almighty, which was before the creation in the creator and in the godhead, and which at his time, by the &s;ame divine and &s;pok|en word came from the father of lights, it is the everla&s;ting e&s;&s;ential word of God, whereby every thing that is in heaven and on earth, in the &s;ea and under the earth was created and made; therefore con|tinue reading, in the &s;aid fir&s;t chapter, and I am &s;ure you will find by the grace of God, that it was utter|ed and &s;poken by the mouth of the Lord, &s;o that it could not be called otherwi&s;e, at the time it was not written yet, as the word of God. But &s;ince his will and his divine word which he has &s;poken, &s;hould be known unto man, he has laid open his council will and his &s;poken word and commandments unto mankind, &s;ince he has endowed man, above all other created beings with an immortal &s;oul, there|&s;ore <PB N="6" REF="045885_0006_10207AC10BEFA230">he has revealed him his will and law. Now tell me dear friends, was it not the Almighty, who &s;poke the words, &s;aying, <HI>Of every tree of the garden thou maye&s;t freely eat; But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou &s;halt not ear of it: for in the day thou eate&s;t thereof, thou &s;halt &s;urely die.</HI> Was it not &s;poken by the Almighty? O! without doubt, it was the word and commandment, which our fir&s;t parents have tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed, through deceit of the &s;er|pent, and Adam and his po&s;terity fell thereby into eternal mi&s;ery, death and damnation. So that God has found means and has given Adam the promi&s;e, on which Adam with all &s;aints has put his hope and tru&s;t, well knowing that what God promi&s;es, he will and can bring about, being a God of truth and without fal&s;hood. Con&s;ider farther what God &s;aid to Noah, and the Lord &s;aid, <HI>My &s;pirit &s;hall not always &s;trive with man, for that he al&s;o is fle&s;h.</HI> And God &s;aid unto Abraham, <HI>Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's hou&s;e, unto a land that I will &s;hew thee.</HI> Here we can &s;ee, how the Lord God has &s;poken with Adam, Noah and Abraham. Who would be &s;o daring and bold as to &s;ay, that it was not the Lord who &s;poke it; except that the Lord has revealed them his word by means of the angels, or by dreams, or by his divine voice as with Adam, or that the Almighty has made them known his word and will, by his everla&s;ting &s;pirit. Ah! dear children, if the Almighty manife&s;ts him|&s;elf in and within us in &s;uch a manner, and reveals us his word, would it not be ab&s;urd to tell him in face, that it was not his word, would we not be guilty like Adam. The Lord having manife&s;ted him|&s;elf before the law was given, as was &s;hewn with <PB N="7" REF="045885_0007_10207B036DC3A708">Adam and the family of Seth, with Noah, Abraham and Lot, and with many others, &s;o they have receiv|ed it as the true and perfect word from the mouth of the Almighty, and have put their hope and tru&s;t therein and were contented, well knowing, that what he promi&s;es, he can and will bring it about. But &s;ince the law was given us by means of the angels, and made known by Mo&s;es in his writings, and it being &s;prung from the Almighty and given to man by angels. Therefore give ear what the Lord him|&s;elf &s;aid about his word: <HI>Hear, O I&s;rael, the Lord our God is one Lord. And thou &s;halt love the Lord thy God, with all thine heart, and with all thy &s;oul, and with all thy might; and the&s;e words which I com|mand thee this day, &s;hall be in thine heart.</HI> Here we may &s;ee what the true man Mo&s;es te&s;tifies of the word of God, how &s;trongly he indicates it to his people, when he &s;aid, "And the Lord &s;pake with you in the mount, out of the mid&s;t of fire, you have heard his voice, and he revealed you his Covenant, which he commanded you to keep, even the ten command|ments, and he wrote them on two tables of &s;tone." Since the Lord has let hear his voice, to his people on mount Horeb, and has brought his word before their ears, and has wrote it him&s;elf, how &s;hould we poor mortals be &s;o daring, to bend and &s;tretch it, or to &s;ay becau&s;e it was wrote, that it is not the word of the Lord, it being brought to us, from God's own mouth, and he him&s;elf has made it manife&s;t, by Mo&s;es and by all his holy Prophets, as he &s;ays: <HI>I will rai&s;e them a Prophet, from among their brethren, like unto thee, and will put my words in his mouth, and he &s;hall &s;peak unto them, all that I &s;hall command him. And it &s;hall come to pa&s;s that who&s;oever will not <PB N="8" REF="045885_0008_10207AC295A86F00">hearken unto my words, which he &s;hall &s;peak in my Name, I will require it of him.</HI> Hear farther how the true &s;ervant Samuel, in his fir&s;t book the 15 chap|ter, calls it the word of the Lord, when he &s;aid. <HI>Now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the Lord,</HI> when he commanded Saul to de&s;troy Amalek; but Saul tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the word of the Lord: then came the word of the Lord unto Samuel &s;aying, It repenteth me, that I have &s;et up Saul to be king: But Samuel rebuked Saul for it and told him, "that rebellion is a &s;in of witchcraft, and &s;tubbornne&s;s as iniquity and idolatry. Becau&s;e thou ha&s;t rejected the word of the Lord, he hath al&s;o rejected thee." Who dare &s;ay without injuring his con&s;cience, that the citations from holy writ abovementioned, which Mo&s;es, God Almighty him&s;elf, Samuel, Abraham and all men of God have le&s;t us, that they have not confe&s;&s;ed it to be, the everla&s;ting word of God; as the Prophet Jeremiah in his 2 Chapter &s;aid: <HI>Hear ye the Word of the Lord,</HI> and in his 7 chapter the Lord commandeth him, to &s;tand in the gate of the Lord's hou&s;e, and to proclaim there this word, and &s;ay, <HI>Hear the word of the Lord, all ye of Judah,</HI> and in his 16 chapter, <HI>the word of the Lord came al&s;o unto me.</HI> This &s;hews clear, how this man of God has &s;poken it as the word of God, al&s;o Ezekiel, in his 6, 7, 12, 13 and 15 chapter, there you will find it confe&s;&s;ed for the true word of God. The Prophet Daniel in his 9th chapter, the 9, 10, 11 and 12 ver&s;e, as we may read in the &s;aid 12th ver&s;e, te&s;tifies it to be the &s;ame, and he hath confirmed his words which he &s;pake again&s;t us; al&s;o Ho&s;ea, the fir&s;t chapter, <HI>and this is the word of the Lord,</HI> likewi&s;e in his 4th chapter; Joel the 1&s;t. chapter, <HI>the word of <PB N="9" REF="045885_0009_10207B06470DDCC8">the Lord came to Joel.</HI> Amos in his fifth chapter, <HI>Hear ye this word, which I take up again&s;t you, O hou&s;e of I&s;rael.</HI> Jonah the 1&s;t. chapter 1&s;t. ver&s;e, now the word of the Lord came unto Jonah, &s;aying, Micah fir&s;t chapter, 1&s;t. ver&s;e, <HI>the word of the Lord came to me:</HI> again Zephaniah it is called the word of the LORD, and Zachariah 1&s;t. chapter, 1 ver&s;e, <HI>the word of the Lord came unto me;</HI> and Sirach &s;aid, <HI>the word of the mo&s;t high, is the fountain of Wi&s;dom, and the everla&s;ting commandment is their &s;ource, and a wi&s;e man puts his plea&s;ure to learn the word of God, ble&s;&s;ed is he that &s;earcheth the word of God, and teach|es it.</HI></P>
<P>I have cited above many pa&s;&s;ages from the old te&s;|tament, how they have all confe&s;&s;ed it to be the word of God; but as &s;ome may &s;tand up, and might &s;ay, that it was the word of the &s;pirit, &s;ince they had &s;poken it, by the holy Gho&s;t, as St. <HI>Peter</HI> &s;aith, <HI>that no prophecy of the &s;cripture is of any private in|terpretation. For the prophecy came not in old times, by the will of man: but holy men of God &s;pake, as they were moved by the holy Gho&s;t.</HI> Therefore it is my real opinion, that they have &s;poken it by the holy Gho&s;t, and it being manife&s;ted from time to time by the &s;pirit of God, &s;o it is indi&s;putable, &s;ince God and his &s;pirit are one in the Godhead; or as our Saviour faith in his word, <HI>God is a &s;pirit: and they that wor&s;hip him, mu&s;t wor&s;hip him in &s;pirit and in truth.</HI> Therefore I tru&s;t entirely in the Almighty, that he has not deceived the&s;e dear in&s;truments, in not having filled and moved them by his eternal &s;pi|rit in &s;uch a manner, that they broke out in &s;o many places: "hear the word of the Lord," and have preached it &s;o manyfold to the di&s;obedient people. <PB N="10" REF="045885_0010_10207AC573A74440">Therefore I &s;hall put the que&s;tion to each and every &s;en&s;ible man, who&s;e word they have &s;et forth, &s;ince they have &s;poken nothing, as what the Almighty has revealed them, by his eternal &s;pirit. You will con|fe&s;s undoubtedly, that if it was &s;poken out or from God or by his eternal &s;pirit, that it is the everla&s;t|ing e&s;&s;ential word of God, which the&s;e holy men have written, and God him&s;elf. So that this word has received the high name of the holy Writ. Holy &s;ince it &s;prung from the Almighty him&s;elf, and was &s;et forth by the holy Gho&s;t, from the mouth of the Prophets and Apo&s;tles. WRIT, it being written and &s;et down by &s;o many faithful men of God, &s;o that it may be termed <HI>the holy Writ.</HI> Dear friends, where|as you teach and confe&s;s, that the written word of God, is not the word of God, but only the holy writ and the word of the &s;pirit, which manife&s;ts it|&s;elf in our &s;ouls, that it is the quickening word. Therefore, my dear children! I mu&s;t bring this que&s;tion home to all and every one of you, who&s;e word it is, that you preach, when the &s;ame &s;pirit of the eternal father, moves, pre&s;&s;es and drives you, and makes your tongues fiery, &s;o that you by the pre&s;&s;ing power of the &s;pirit of God, teach, &s;peak and manife&s;t unto all men, the word and will of God? as Mo&s;es and the Almighty, and all Prophets and Saints have preached, by the eternal &s;pirit of God, and have it all from time to time, confe&s;&s;ed and &s;po|ken as the word of God, as I have &s;hewn heretofore by many quotations from &s;cripture; I could cite more pa&s;&s;ages, but to prevent much writings, I &s;hall refer the benign Reader to their own publications, there they will find enough. Such a great number of children of God, having taken it, in &s;o many places for the <PB N="11" REF="045885_0011_10207B0973031500">word of the Lord; I mu&s;t ask you once more, who&s;e word it is, that nothing is &s;poken with you, as what the holy &s;pirit &s;ays; will you &s;ay, it is not the word of the Lord, that you preach, I mu&s;t tell you that you err, and dare &s;ay with the Prophet, <HI>How do ye &s;ay, we are wi&s;e, and the law of the Lord is with us? Lo, certainly in vain made he it; the pen of the Scribes is in vain. The wi&s;e men are a&s;hamed, they are di&s;mayed and taken: lo, they have rejected the word of the Lord; and what wi&s;dom is in them?</HI> or as he farther &s;aith, by the mouth of the Prophet; <HI>he that hath my word, let &s;peak my word faithfully: What is the chaff to the wheat?</HI> &s;aith the Lord, <HI>Is not my word like as fire?</HI> &s;aith the Lord; <HI>and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces; but if they had &s;tood in my coun&s;el, and had cau&s;ed my people to hear my words, then they &s;hould have turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings.</HI> But if you will &s;ay, that it is the word and will of God you preach or reveal, I mu&s;t tell, that it is impo&s;&s;ible that the Spirit of God, or God him&s;elf &s;hould have erred &s;o far, as to think him&s;elf too clean, ju&s;t and good, to call it the word of God, which the Almigh|ty from all ages has &s;poken by his Spirit; this is con|trary to all &s;cripture of the old and new te&s;tament. Our Saviour had greatly mi&s;taken him&s;elf, when he &s;aith, <HI>They have Mo&s;es and the prophets, let them hear them,</HI> and again, <HI>till heaven and earth pa&s;s, one jot or one tittle, &s;hall in nowi&s;e pa&s;s from the law;</HI> and the Lord &s;aith, <HI>Ye &s;hall not add unto the word which I com|mand you, neither &s;hall ye dimini&s;h ought from it.</HI> I have quoted many pa&s;&s;ages from the old te&s;tament, how the Lord God him&s;elf has &s;poken by his Spirit through the holy prophets, and has &s;tiled it his word, <PB N="12" REF="045885_0012_10207AC9A493BD30">or his will, law and commandment. There you may &s;ee my dear friends, with what excellent name the word of God was &s;tyled before it was written; therefore I &s;hall quote you &s;ome te&s;timonies from the new te&s;tament, where our Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t him|&s;elf teaches, when he called us unto repentance and to believe in the go&s;pel: this word of the go&s;pel is the good tidings of the Almighty father, which no patriarch, nor prophet or other &s;aint could bring us, but it has co&s;t the word of the Almighty, whereby he made all things, the eternal word of God, which was from eternity with the father and in God. Yea, it required that God him&s;elf came, when the time was accompli&s;hed, into fle&s;h, to take away the enmi|ty and to announce unto all men the&s;e good tidings, of which Adam under the law and all prophets have prophe&s;ied in &s;o many places; but none of them could bring us this perfect good tiding, but it requi|red the man from the tribe of Judah, who has brought us the &s;ame by his free grace, from the high throne of his divine maje&s;ty. On this good tiding of the divine grace have hoped all good children of God. But whereas you (for con&s;cience-&s;ake) deny the writ|ten word and the everla&s;ting peace of God, the go&s;|pel time, which was brought to us by no mortal man, but the &s;on or the word of the almighty Fa|ther, has brought it to us from heaven, as his father's word and will. This go&s;pel-word of the almighty Creator, my dear friends, was with the godhead, which was manife&s;ted as well under the law as by all prophets, as a ray of the divine light, till the Son of God as the perfect lawgiver, has preached the go&s;|pel of the peace, and has called it in many places the word of God, as we may read, <HI>If a man love me, <PB N="13" REF="045885_0013_10207B0AF8A290D0">he will keep my words: verily, verily, I &s;ay unto you, he that heareth my word, and believeth on him that &s;ent me, hath everla&s;ting life.</HI> Here you will &s;ee my dear friends, how our Saviour repeats verily, <HI>he that heareth my word;</HI> but whole word, ah! undoubt|edly the go&s;pel-word, which he has brought from heaven, but the Godhead dwelling perfectly in him, he &s;aith farther, <HI>and believeth on him that &s;ent me.</HI> There my dear friends we may &s;ee, how he called his doctrine his word; &s;ince the father dwelleth in him, &s;o the heavenly father has &s;poken out or through his dear child, which is and was his word. This go&s;|pel-word is flown from the Father through the mouth of Chri&s;t; <HI>and in this word &s;aith our Saviour, &s;hall we believe, that we might live thereby.</HI> And again he &s;aith, <HI>My doctrine is not mine, but his that &s;ent me;</HI> he teaches moreover, <HI>If any man will do his will, he &s;hall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I &s;peak of my&s;elf. I am not come to judge, but the word that I have &s;poken, the &s;ame &s;hall judge him, in the la&s;t day. Verily, verily I &s;ay unto you, if a man keep my &s;aying, he &s;hall never &s;ee death. If a man love me, he will keep my words, and my father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him. He that loveth me not, keepeth not my &s;ayings: and the word which you hear, is not mine, but the father's which &s;ent me: if they have kept my &s;aying, they will keep yours al&s;o.</HI> There my dear friends you &s;ee, how Chri&s;t, the &s;on of the living God, who was with God and in God, by whom all things were made, the fountain of all, the king and ruler of the univer&s;e, the high and eter|nal God, was not a&s;hamed, nor thought it below his dignity, to call his doctrine his word, and this <PB N="14" REF="045885_0014_10207ACC7ADB90E0">in &s;o many places, and has given the word he has &s;poken, divine honor, that he &s;hould not judge, but the word, that he has &s;poken. Therefore I confe&s;s it al&s;o, with Je&s;us Chri&s;t, with the Almighty, with Mo&s;es, with all prophets and children of God, that it is the law, word and commandment of the mo&s;t high God, which all true children of God, were bound to keep, without adding or dimini&s;hing it. Therefore I mu&s;t ask each and every one of you who&s;e word and commandment it was, that Adam tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ed, without doubt the word of the eternal cre|ator which he pronounced: <HI>For in the day that thou eate&s;t thereof, thou &s;halt &s;urely die.</HI> Who&s;e word was it that the children of I&s;rael have tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed, that they all fell in the wilderne&s;s. Tell me who&s;e word it was, that the Almighty &s;poke on mount Si|nai, and which he has written on two tables of &s;tone, was it not the commandment and word of the Almigh|ty? which he has given them by Mo&s;es, that they might know and under&s;tand, how they &s;hould &s;erve the Al|mighty, and in this law he has commanded them, <HI>If you will &s;et a king over you, in the land where I &s;hall bring thee, the book of the law &s;hall be with him, and he &s;hall read therein all the days of his life, and that he turn not a&s;ide from the commandment, to the right hand or to the left.</HI> Dear friends, it was this commandment that Ahab aud all I&s;rael have &s;et a&s;ide and wor&s;hipped the idols. Who&s;e word and com|mandment was it that Saul has tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed? Was it not the word and commandment of the mo&s;t High, given him by Samuel? Who&s;e commandment was it, that Mana&s;&s;eh and his people have tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed when they &s;acrificed their children to the devils, and adored all ho&s;ts of heaven? and have rejected the will <PB N="15" REF="045885_0015_10207B0CC2D97248">of the Almighty, the book of the law, which was given through Mo&s;es from the mouth of the Almigh|ty. Was it not the commandment of God that Je|robeam and I&s;rael broke, when he made two calves of gold, that the man of God, through the word of the Lord, prophe&s;ied again&s;t him and the altar in Bethel? Who&s;e word was it, that the man of God has tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed, when the fal&s;e prophet per&s;uadeth him to turn back with him, and did eat bread in his hou&s;e, and drank water? Has not David &s;inned again&s;t the word of God by in&s;tigation of Satan, when he out of pride got the people numbered, he has al|&s;o tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the word of the Lord, when he com|mitted adultery with the wife of Uriah, and got him &s;lain by the &s;word of the Ammonites? Who&s;e word was it, which Nathan &s;aid unto David, was it Na|than's word or the Lord's? O! certainly it was the word of the Lord. Therefore look and read the holy prophets through, and there you will find, that they have been always a di&s;obedient hou&s;e or people, and how the Almighty, &s;o many times and in &s;o many places, has called, threatned and warned them by his prophets; that they might return from their wicked|ne&s;s, and commandeth them to keep his law &s;trictly; which prophecies, God the Almighty father, in &s;o many and various places, calls, pronounces and pro|fe&s;&s;es him&s;elf to be his word, that if we only &s;hould read it, we would be &s;ufficiently convinced, that the law and the prophets are nothing le&s;s, as the word, will and commandment of God, manife&s;ted from time to time unto mankind, and &s;et down in writing by the&s;e good men, and for rea&s;on they were written, &s;tyled the writ. From the&s;e rea&s;ons I &s;ay that tho&s;e people err greatly, who do not confe&s;s it <PB N="16" REF="045885_0016_10207ACF5B4ED070">to be the word of the Lord, but take it only for the holy writ, and your confe&s;&s;ing, that men being mi&s;|led by it, you decline to call the written word, the word of God. Therefore I mu&s;t put this que&s;tion home to you, By what was Adam and Eve deceived, were they beguiled by the word of the Almighty fa|ther or by the &s;ubtlety of the &s;erpent? Dear friends, by what came Cain, to the atrocious crime of kill|ing his brother Abel? has the everla&s;ting word of God brought him to this act? I think not, but his own revengeful, wrathful, irreconcilable heart, which was not lighted by the word of God, but of hell; hear how the divine Maje&s;ty has warned and addre&s;&s;ed him: <HI>Cain why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen? If thou doe&s;t well, &s;halt thou not be accepted? and if thou doe&s;t not well, &s;in lieth at the door. And unto thee &s;hall be his de&s;ire, and thou &s;halt rule over him.</HI> What was it, that has made the Antideluvians &s;o wicked, was it the word of the Lord, which the mo&s;t High &s;aid unto Noah, <HI>My &s;pirit &s;hall not always &s;trive with man, for that he is al&s;o fle&s;h: yet his days &s;hall be an hundred and twenty years,</HI> or his numerous admonitions or the ark be built. Have the&s;e divine manife&s;tations of the everla&s;ting word of God corrected the&s;e people, I think not, but the cur&s;ed disbelieve, (which is the &s;ource of all ungodline&s;s) blended their hearts, that they could not believe the correcting word of God, but lived in their lu&s;ts and &s;atanical de&s;ires, little minding the word of the Lord, nor his various ad|monitions, in which he foretold them God's puni&s;h|ment, nor the ark, which &s;hould be a &s;ign to them of God's correcting hand. Is there any per&s;on that could &s;hew, that the rebellious children of I&s;rael, who <PB N="17" REF="045885_0017_10207B11064B7B10">fell a &s;acrifice in the wilderne&s;s, that they were de|luded by the commandment and word of God. I think in my opinion, that who&s;oever will &s;hun his con&s;cience mu&s;t confe&s;s, that they through their lu&s;ts of fle&s;h and devili&s;h de&s;ires, have always rebelled again&s;t the word of God. What made Ahab and Iezebel and all I&s;rael, tran&s;gre&s;s the law and word of the Almighty? I &s;hould think the fal&s;e prophets and prie&s;t of the high places, and not the word of the Lord. Ah! how well would it have been for Ahab, if he had taken to heart the word of God, which was told by the man of God Micah. Was Mana&s;&s;eh &s;educed by the law of the Lord, that he and all I&s;rael lived af|ter the abominations of the heathens and wor&s;hipped all the ho&s;t of heaven, and &s;erved them? Tell me dear friends, have they wrought wickedne&s;s by the word or commandment of God, in which the Lord in va|rious places of the old te&s;tament, calls, admoni&s;hes and warns, that they &s;hould &s;erve no other Gods but him? After my opinon dear friends, all them that have tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the law, word and commandment of God under the old te&s;tament, have not done it by the word of God, but by their own wickedne&s;s, lu&s;ts of fle&s;h and bad de&s;ires, they fell from the law of God and did after the abominations of the heathens, and thereby provoked the Lord to anger. Tell me who&s;e book of the law it was, that Hilkiah found in the hou&s;e or temple of the Lord, which book Shaphan read before king Jo&s;iah; who hearing the words of the book, rent his clothes. Who&s;e words were they, that the king grew terrified at? I think not at the word of Mo&s;es, but the word and commandment of the Almighty was tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed by Mana&s;&s;eh, by Amon and all I&s;rael, &s;o that they by their wickedne&s;s have <PB N="18" REF="045885_0018_10207AD0E2F58620">provoked the anger of God. Read all the books of the prophets, wherein the will of God is manife&s;ted, there you will find by the grace of God, that the rebel|lious children, were not &s;educed by the word of the Lord, but by in&s;tigation of Satan. It might be put the que&s;tion, whether the children of men in our days, are made to &s;in by the word of God? I think not, but as the apo&s;tle Paul &s;aid, <HI>becau&s;e they receiv|ed not the love of the truth, that they might be &s;aved: And for this cau&s;e, God &s;hall &s;end them &s;trong delu&s;i|ons, that they believe a lie;</HI> and whereas our own fle&s;h and blood is always rebellious and di&s;obedient to the word of the Lord, and bent to do evil, &s;eeks and de&s;ires nothing, but the things and plea&s;ures of this world, and as long as we &s;top our ears before the menacing word of the Almighty, and not let us lead by the &s;pirit of grace and the go&s;pel which Je&s;us Chri&s;t brought from heaven; Ah! as long as we &s;top our ears before the menacing word, and not accept the gladful tidings of the go&s;pel, ah! it is not the law nor the go&s;pel that makes us &s;in; but it mu&s;t be the Son of God him&s;elf that &s;educes poor mortals, &s;ince it was him that brought us his go&s;pel, and has confirmed it with &s;o many &s;igns and wonders: &s;o that we cannot &s;ee Je&s;us after the fle&s;h, but after the &s;pi|rit, that is, if we let us led by the eternal &s;pirit of God, he will lead us in all truth; God being the truth, and cannot tell a fal&s;hood after Paul, it mu&s;t be his word without contradiction, and what he has &s;poken mu&s;t be the truth, which all children of God have accepted as the &s;ame, not as a literal but as a &s;piritual word: And if we will look with &s;piri|tual eyes into the written word of God, there we can|not &s;ee Je&s;us after the fle&s;h, but after the &s;pirit, we <PB N="19" REF="045885_0019_10207B1555E1D650">can &s;ee his image, how he came into this world and how he has opened by his virtues, light, life and ex|ample, the door to the kingdom of grace and to eternal life. Ah! who only believes, that his word is truth, he can &s;ee him, as they have &s;een him &s;e|venteen hundred and ninety years ago, with all his &s;igns and wonders. But finding in various places of holy writ, e&s;pecially in the prophets, how he was a &s;tumbling block, whereon the two hou&s;es were of|fended; I mu&s;t ask each one of you, &s;ince men, when he was on earth, grew only wor&s;e, &s;tumbled at him and fell, was the Son of the Almighty, the cau&s;e of it? who as St. John &s;aid, <HI>was the word, and the word was with God, and the word was God.</HI> Should any body dare to &s;tep forward, again&s;t the te&s;timony of St, John and others, who witne&s;s of him, that he was the word, and &s;ay, that he was not the word of God, becau&s;e men grew only wor&s;er by him? as old Simeon &s;aid of him, <HI>that he was &s;et for the fall and ri&s;ing again of many in I&s;rael; and for a &s;ign which &s;hall be &s;poken again&s;t;</HI> Ah! dear friends whom or at what have the children of men &s;poken again&s;t or were offended at, at him or at his doctrine or word? I think not at his word, which he preached to men, but as they &s;ay them&s;elves, <HI>that they do not &s;tone him for his good works, but for his bla&s;phemy, being a man and making him&s;elf a God;</HI> Here my dear friends here you may &s;ee, that they were not offended at his being a man, ah! they could have bore and tolerate him, if it had not been for his divine doctrine and word, which came from God, and was &s;poken by the eternal Son of God. See dear friends, at this very &s;ame word of God, which the Son of God has revealed, whereby he has manife&s;ted his divine image, <PB N="20" REF="045885_0020_10207AD3E01A98F0">light and brightne&s;s, the image of his godhead, his father's everla&s;ting will and coun&s;el, being with God from eternity; which go&s;pel doctrine, has &s;pread &s;uch divine light and brightne&s;s and has expre&s;&s;ed the image of Je&s;us in &s;uch a per&s;picuous and perfect a man|ner, that it &s;hone into darkne&s;s, but darkne&s;s have not comprehended it, for their works were bad. But &s;ince the light of life, that is the word of God, has &s;hone &s;o clear, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that it not on|ly reprimanded wicked &s;inners, but the thoughts of the heart al&s;o, <HI>why think you &s;o evil in your hearts?</HI> Ah! they were not deluded by the meek go&s;pel of Je|&s;us Chri&s;t, but by their own fle&s;h and blood and thro' deceit of Satan and by his hypocri&s;y, whereby he thinks to cloke his devili&s;h doctrine under the figure of an angel, and pretending to be a teacher of the go&s;|pel, he does as he did our fir&s;t parents, and has done &s;ince and at all ages, when he pretended truth for his fal&s;hoods. Ah! therefore, dear friends, don't be deceived, as if men were made to &s;in by God's holy word; Ah! by no means friends, but we poor crea|tures are deluded, by our own lu&s;ts and de&s;ires, which dwell in our fle&s;h, and by &s;ubtlety of the Devil; this each &s;en&s;ible man will confe&s;s. For this rea&s;on I mu&s;t ask you, perceiving from your writings, that you take the word of the Spirit, for the word of God, which I do likewi&s;e; whether the holy Gho&s;t, who is the true teacher and expounder, of the many gifts of God, may reveal unto us another law, word, doc|trine or go&s;pel, than the Son of God or God him&s;elf has made manife&s;t unto us? I think not! or the Son of God mu&s;t have erred, when he &s;aid, <HI>he &s;hall take it of mine, and &s;hall &s;hew it unto you,</HI> and again: <HI>But the comforter, which is the holy Gho&s;t, whom the fa|ther <PB N="21" REF="045885_0021_10207B18890795A0">will &s;end in my name, he &s;hall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance. what&s;oever I have &s;aid unto you.</HI> St. Paul would have been mi&s;|taken al&s;o, when he &s;aid, <HI>if any man preach any other go&s;pel unto you, than that ye have received, let him be accur&s;ed, and the go&s;pel which was preached of me, is not after man. For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Je|&s;us Chri&s;t; for I have not &s;hunned to declare unto you all the coun&s;el of God.</HI> See al&s;o in St. John where he &s;aith: <HI>if there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your hou&s;e.</HI> And St. Peter &s;aith: <HI>we have al&s;o a more &s;ure word of pro|phecy; whereunto ye do well, that ye take heed, as un|to a light that &s;hineth in a dark place;</HI> and St. John again: <HI>who&s;oever tran&s;gre&s;&s;eth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Chri&s;t, hath not God:</HI> and St. Paul, <HI>and if any man obey not my word by this epi&s;tle, note that man, and have no company with him.</HI> The written word being then &s;o well atte&s;ted, and its doctrine by a number of witne&s;&s;es and of our Saviour him&s;elf, declared for his word, which he has confirmed by his precious blood, and of which St. Paul &s;aith, <HI>How &s;hall we e&s;cape, if we neglect &s;o great &s;alvation,</HI> which at the fir&s;t began, to be &s;poken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him. I have told you in the foregoing my meaning and be|lief of the written word of God, and have &s;hewn you from the old and new te&s;tament, how all &s;aints and children of God, have confe&s;&s;ed it, to be the word of the Lord. And if the contrary can be proved to me, and the te&s;timonies of all the&s;e witne&s;&s;es I have quoted, annihilated; but not through philo&s;ophical &s;ubtlety, but by the immediate te&s;timonies of holy <PB N="22" REF="045885_0022_10207ADB12D4A9D8">writ, that they have erred or wrote fal&s;ely; then I will confe&s;s and &s;ay, that I am mi&s;taken, for taking the written word, for the word of God. But O my God! I tru&s;t in thee, that thou wilt not a&s;hame us poor creatures, in this re&s;pect, with thy child Je&s;us and all holy prophets, apo&s;tles and &s;o many thou|&s;ands of &s;aints, who have all received it as thy word. Therefore I mu&s;t be&s;eech you, to take up this my epi&s;tle in love, and take it in con&s;ideration without partiality, and not to &s;ee on the &s;imple &s;tyle, but look to the ground. I &s;hall quit here and refer the reader to the holy bible, there he will find more ground, if he &s;earches with an upright heart. I re|commend you to the word of grace, wi&s;hing that God will lead and enlighten me and you, with his everla&s;t|ing Spirit through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, Amen.

<HEAD>OF THE CHRISTIAN BAPTISM.</HEAD>
<P>I CONFESS al&s;o dear friends! a chri&s;tian Bapti&s;m of the faithful children of God, which is to be admini&s;tered with water, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Gho&s;t, which bap|ti&s;m is a reception into the church and congregation of &s;aints; which bapti&s;m ought to be admini&s;tered un|to all men, who &s;tand in their fir&s;t birth, and ought not to be called a chri&s;tian bapti&s;m, if it is knowing|ly admini&s;tred unto unconverted, &s;ince the go&s;pel doctrine of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, is not literal but &s;piritual, as he him&s;elf &s;aith, <HI>the word which I have &s;poken is &s;pi|rit and is life.</HI> It being then &s;piritual, it requires al|&s;o &s;piritual and regenerated men, who&s;e hearts were changed by the word of truth, and became new crea|tures, that were brought from &s;in, to the virtue of Chri&s;t, from death to life and from darkne&s;s to the light of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who &s;trive to crucify their fle&s;h and to mortify and to &s;ubdue their lu&s;ts. All &s;uch has St. John the bapti&s;t baptized and not wick|ed &s;inners, but has told them <HI>to repent, that they might bring forth fruits meet for repentance.</HI> See! the&s;e has St. John baptized, and all &s;uch has Je&s;us Chri&s;t commanded to baptize, when he &s;aith, <HI>All power is given unto me, in heaven and on earth. Go ye there|fore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Gho&s;t; teaching them to ob&s;erve all things what&s;oever I have <PB N="24" REF="045885_0024_10207ADC9964A7F8">commanded you;</HI> and again: <HI>go ye into all the world, and preach the go&s;pel to every creature. He that be|lieveth, and is baptized, &s;hall be &s;aved; but he that believeth not, &s;hall be damned.</HI> This injunction the di&s;ciples or apo&s;tles, received as the commandment of their Lord and ma&s;ter: But the Lord &s;aying by Jeremiah, <HI>Behold the days come, that I will make a new covenant with the hou&s;e of I&s;rael, and with the hou&s;e of Judah. Not according to the covenant I made with their fathers; but this &s;hall be the covenant, that I will make with the hou&s;e of I&s;rael; after tho&s;e days,</HI> &s;aith the Lord, <HI>I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they &s;hall be my people. And they &s;hall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his bro|ther, &s;aying, know the Lord; for they &s;hall all know me, from the lea&s;t of them, unto the greate&s;t.</HI> The go&s;pel word or new te&s;tament, which our Saviour has revealed, being &s;piritual, it is out of the power of the natural man to comprehend it, therefore the di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t were not able at fir&s;t, to compre|hend it perfectly, being yet earthly minded, therefore our Saviour told them, <HI>that they could not bear it now; But the holy Gho&s;t, whom the father will &s;end in my name, he &s;hall teach you all things, and bring all things, to your remembrance, what&s;oever I have &s;aid unto you.</HI> Therefore the di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t were yet wholly unable to propagate the economy of the go&s;|pel, the holy &s;pirit not re&s;ting perfectly upon them; for this rea&s;on their Lord and ma&s;ter commanded them, <HI>not to depart from Jeru&s;alem, but wait for the promi&s;e of the father,</HI> to this commandment they were obedient, waiting in prayer day and night, till the day of Penteco&s;t, when they were filled with the holy <PB N="25" REF="045885_0025_10207B1A10946A50">Gho&s;t, &s;o that their tongues, were like as of fire, and then they began after their Lord and ma&s;ter's com|mandment to teach and to baptize, and in admini|&s;tring of the &s;ame they have continued, not by the literal word of the law, but by the word of the Spi|rit, of which the Spirit of God is the right teacher and interpreter, and in this order they have continu|ed, as we can find in &s;o many places, in the Acts of the apo&s;tles. Therefore the prophecies of the pro|phets are accompli&s;hed, that they will teach no more one another, but they will all be teached of the Lord; the di&s;ciples having not teached, but the Spirit has &s;poken through them, and have e&s;tabli&s;hed, the eco|nomy of the go&s;pel, as bapti&s;m and the Lord's &s;up|per, and the wa&s;hing of feet, likewi&s;e excommuni|cation and forbearing. All the&s;e ordinances I con|fe&s;s not to be derived from the Jewi&s;h law, but to be evangelical and chri&s;tian ordinances of God. You dear friends! confe&s;&s;ing in your writings, that bap|ti&s;m, belongs not to the economy of the go&s;pel, but being derived from the law. Therefore I mu&s;t a&s;k you dear friends, to prove to me by the law; where bapti&s;m has begun under the law, has it not taken its ri&s;e, with John the bapti&s;t? had John his bapti&s;m from the law? I think not, but by the divine com|mandment, or this great prophet, has mi&s;informed us, when he &s;aid, <HI>but he that &s;ent me to baptize with water, the &s;ame &s;aid unto me, upon whom thou &s;halt &s;ee, the Spirit de&s;cending and remaining on him.</HI> Our Saviour al&s;o que&s;tioned the Phari&s;ees, <HI>whether the bapti&s;m of John was from heaven or of men?</HI> Why did not the &s;cribes and Phari&s;ees an&s;wer it was from the law, they had not need to be in fear of being &s;to|ned by the people, but they could not, bapti&s;m not <PB N="26" REF="045885_0026_10207AE0C6570818">being founded in the law. John being a forerunner and preacher of repentance, he baptized with the bapti&s;m of repentance, which is the entrance into the new covenant; thus he had the commandment from God, and Je&s;us Chri&s;t being not come, to do his will, but the will of his Father, therefore he got him|&s;elf baptized by John, in obedience to God, telling him, <HI>for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Wherein con&s;i&s;teth the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, that he got him&s;elf baptized by John, what u&s;e could he derive from water, being the Son of God, perfect, ju&s;t and good? Tell me dear friends, wherein could the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t be, in the water or in the word of God, which commanded John to baptize? In my opinion in both, in the fir&s;t place, the righte|ou&s;ne&s;s of God pre&s;&s;ing on the word, and being obe|dient to his father, righteou&s;ne&s;s is fulfilled. And water was only a &s;ign, proof, or outward ceremony or work, whereby the obedience of Chri&s;t, was con|firmed and e&s;tabli&s;hed. There you may &s;ee, where|in the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t con&s;i&s;ted, in his bap|ti&s;m with water, or only in his obedience. Your teaching that Chri&s;t has not commanded the outward bapti&s;m with water, but only the bapti&s;m with the Spirit; has he not told them after his re&s;urrection, <HI>to go teaching all nations, and to baptize them who be|lieves?</HI> To this commandment the apo&s;tles were o|bedient, as we find, when St. Peter on the day of Penteco&s;t, preaching to them, that they were prick|ed in their hearts, that they cried out, <HI>men and bre|thren, what &s;hall we do, to be &s;aved?</HI> Then Peter &s;aid unto them, <HI>repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins, and ye &s;hall receive the gift of the holy Gho&s;t.</HI> Dear <PB N="27" REF="045885_0027_10207B1D9451A130">friends, here you may &s;ee, how they have baptized them with water, and after bapti&s;m promi&s;ed them the gift of the holy Gho&s;t; we find that Philip has teached and baptized in Samaria, and that after bap|ti&s;m, Peter and John prayed over them and laid their hands on them, that they might receive the holy Gho&s;t. Philip has al&s;o baptized the eunuch, tell me what has he teached the Ethiopian, that he wanted to be baptized, when they came unto a certain water? Likewi&s;e St. Peter with Cornelius, when the holy Gho&s;t fell on them, before they were baptized with water; why has Peter commandeth them, to be bap|tized with water afterwards? Do you think that this dear in&s;trument, who was full of the holy Gho&s;t, was not &s;en&s;ible of the word of God? I think not, but being a clear commandment of the go&s;pel. We can find al&s;o, how St. Paul was baptized by Ananias, likewi&s;e, how Paul has baptized the keeper of the pri&s;on with all his hou&s;e, when he believed in God; al&s;o the &s;eller of purple, and the di&s;ciples, unto which he &s;aid, <HI>have ye received the holy Gho&s;t &s;ince ye be|lieved? and they &s;aid unto him, we have not &s;o much as heard whether there be any holy Gho&s;t, and who were baptized with the bapti&s;m of John.</HI> The bapti&s;m of John, being the bapti&s;m of repentance, which refers man unto Chri&s;t, therefore has St. Paul baptized them on the name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, then they receiv|ed the holy Gho&s;t and &s;poke with tongues. Many more te&s;timonies could be produced, how they ad|mini&s;tred the outward ceremony of the bapti&s;m with water unto them. It being dear friends! your in|tention to break through the outward bapti&s;m with water, I mu&s;t ask you, an&s;wer me from holy writ, where our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, has given his di&s;ciples <PB N="28" REF="045885_0028_10207AE256702FB8">or apo&s;tles, the power, or commandeth them, to baptize men, with the holy Gho&s;t? Does not our Lord him&s;elf exclaim, in many places by the pro|phets, <HI>that in the la&s;t days, he would pour out, his Spirit upon all fle&s;h;</HI> and John the bapti&s;t &s;aid, <HI>I in|deed baptize you with water unto repentance, but he that cometh after me, he &s;hall baptize you with the ho|ly Gho&s;t, and with fire.</HI> Take notice dear friends, what our Saviour him&s;elf &s;aid: <HI>it is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart I will &s;end him unto you; and when he is come, he will reprove the world of &s;in.</HI> Lo! dear friends from the&s;e quotati|ons of the old and new te&s;tament, and you will find, that the&s;e bapti&s;m of the Spirit. was commandeth unto no man, or much le&s;s, that we poor mortals, could communicate one another the gift of the Spi|rit, but it is a divine hidden wi&s;dom of God, and power of the almighty Father, which &s;pirit of grace, he gives to all his children, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, &s;o that he comes upon each of them, who is become a new creature and regenerated, humbling him&s;elf with a low and contrite heart, in obedience to Chri&s;t, that is, his word, which he has &s;poken and revealed, in all humility before the throne of grace, ardently pray|ing day and night, for the &s;pirit of grace, to be cloth|ed with power, and to lighten the fire of his divine love in the heart. The bapti&s;m of the &s;pirit is there|fore a free gift and effu&s;ion of the Almighty, which we poor ereatures, can attain in no other way, than by a contrite heart and continual prayer. On this &s;pirit of grace were the di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t waiting at Jeru&s;alem, till they received the &s;pirit of grace, and by their continual prayers they have obtained the <PB N="29" REF="045885_0029_10207B21C089D910">promi&s;e of the father, and thus the &s;pirit of grace, is to be obtained in no other way, as I have &s;hewn heretofore, I &s;hall ask you, an&s;wer me, has St. Pe|ter baptized the house of Cornelius, with the holy Gho&s;t, or was it an heavenly divine &s;ecret bapti&s;m of the Spirit, unknowing to Peter? &s;o that he was a&s;toni&s;hed, that the holy Gho&s;t (mind) fell on the Gentiles. Tell me have St. Peter and John baptized the di&s;ciples of Samaria with the holy Gho&s;t, or was it done by him, who John the bapti&s;t has &s;hewn? I think it was done by him, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Peter and John's ar|dent prayer: hear, what Peter &s;aid, <HI>that by him which they had denied and killed, the Spirit had been poured out,</HI> and quotes from the prophet Joel, <HI>that this were the days, promi&s;ed by God, in which he would pour out, his Spirit upon all fle&s;h.</HI> Tell me has Ananias, baptized Paul with water or with the holy Gho&s;t? I think with water, and Paul turning him&s;elf unto repentance and received the word and will of God, with an open heart, God has given him, his Spirit by his free grace. Tell me has Paul the apo&s;tle baptized the twelve, only with the holy Gho&s;t, and not with water? Ah no! but with wa|ter, and afterwards the holy Gho&s;t fell on them, that they &s;poke with tongues. From this it is clear and evident, that Chri&s;t, has not commanded his di&s;ci|ples, or given them power, to make u&s;e of the bap|ti&s;m of the Spirit, but has told them to preach the go&s;pel, and who&s;oever believes in the &s;ame, and re|pents in humble obedience, him they &s;hould baptize; and who was baptized already, but believes not the go&s;pel, &s;hall be damned. Here dear friends! we may &s;ee, how it is not the bapti&s;m of the Spirit, which our Saviour commanded his di&s;ciples; for it <PB N="30" REF="045885_0030_10207AE3DC9830C0">may not be obtained by any men, except he is a true child of God. God knowing and &s;earching the hearts of men, we cannot deceive him, with hypo|cri&s;y: but poor mortals as we are, we may be de|ceived, as we may &s;ee, how Philip was deceived by Simon; when Peter and John came, laying their hands on the di&s;ciples and praying over them, they received the holy Gho&s;t; there the heart of Simon revealed him&s;elf, when he offered them money, to give him power that on whom&s;oever he layed hands, he might receive the holy Gho&s;t. But Peter &s;aid un|to him, <HI>thy money peri&s;h with thee, becau&s;e thou ha&s;t thought that the gift of God, may be purcha&s;ed with money; thou ha&s;t neither part nor lat, in this matter.</HI> Here we may &s;ee, that to be &s;aved, con&s;i&s;t not in bapti&s;m, but in the word, being commanded in it; as Abraham, when he received the command to &s;a|crifice his &s;on I&s;aac, he being obedient unto God, which was held him for his righteou&s;ne&s;s. The &s;a|crificing of his &s;on, being a te&s;timony, proof or &s;eal of his obedience, whereby his faith was confirmed. It is the &s;ame with the outward bapti&s;m with water, &s;ince it was expre&s;sly commandeth, therefore all faithful children of God, become new creatures, by obedience and the word of truth; our Saviour &s;ay|ing, <HI>If a man love me, he will keep my words; if you love me, keep my commandments;</HI> for this rea&s;on they believing firmly, that who&s;oever tran&s;gre&s;&s;es, has no God. But &s;ince you &s;ay and will take it for a &s;trong argument, when the apo&s;tle &s;aid, <HI>that there is one Lord, one faith, one bapti&s;m,</HI> from this you will infer, that there is only the bapti&s;m of the Spi|rit, and you will of cour&s;e deny any other bapti&s;m, though our Saviour him&s;elf &s;aith: <HI>that he mu&s;t be <PB N="31" REF="045885_0031_10207B2494EFECA0">baptized with a bapti&s;m,</HI> and again he &s;aid to his di|&s;ciples, <HI>are ye able to be baptized with the bapti&s;m, that I am baptized with? ye &s;hall indeed be baptized, with the bapti&s;m that I am baptized with.</HI> Here we can &s;ee how Chri&s;t, &s;peaks of another bapti&s;m, where|with they mu&s;t be baptized; all children of God hav|ing participated in that bapti&s;m of &s;ufferance. Here we may &s;ee, how Chri&s;t &s;peaks not only of the bap|ti&s;m of the &s;pirit, but of three different bapti&s;ms, that is, of water, &s;pirit and &s;ufferance, and calls them all three bapti&s;ms. Therefore, if we look right|ly into the doctrine and meaning of the apo&s;tle, it may be well, that there is only one Lord, one faith and one bapti&s;m, that is, he being the only Lord and Ruler of the univer&s;e, and has manife&s;ted his go&s;pel word, and cau&s;ed it to be revealed and preached by his di&s;ciples and apo&s;tles, how it is the perfect will and commandment of the Almighty Father, which Je&s;us Chri&s;t brought from heaven. See dear friends for this rea&s;on, he is called one Lord by Paul, when he &s;aid further, that there is one faith, &s;o we cannot find more but one faith; this faith is not literal, as all men confe&s;s, when they &s;ay, that they believe in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, but deny his word, by their works and deeds. Ah dear friends! this is not the genuine quickening faith, but this faith has the quality, to make the heart good and upright before God, it is a gift and pre&s;ent of the Almighty, which we poor crea|tures cannot communicate one another, but is to be derived from the word of God, if it is preached in right a manner, there it receives faith, which quick|ening faith moves and pre&s;&s;es &s;inners, &s;o that they grow terrified, quit &s;in and live voluntarily in obe|dience to the word. This faith being accompanied <PB N="32" REF="045885_0032_10207AEAB5CA66A8">with the love or &s;pirit of God, and our Saviour &s;ays, <HI>that he leads into all truth,</HI> and love being from God, it leads al&s;o to the keeping of the commandment of God, as our Saviour &s;ays, <HI>if you love me you will keep my commandments,</HI> and John teaches: <HI>he that &s;aid, he loves God, and keeps not his commandments, is a liar.</HI> Since true quickening faith, bids &s;o &s;trict|ly the keeping of the word, and the &s;pirit leads unto truth, and love to obedience and keeping of the com|mandments of God. And whereas the apo&s;tles were clothed with the &s;ame &s;pirit, faith and love, &s;o this &s;pirit, faith and love have driven, moved and made their tongues fiery, that they in the fir&s;t place, after the commandment of their Lord and ma&s;ter, begun to teach, and then to baptize with water, in the name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins, in the name of the Father, and of the Son and of the holy Gho&s;t, as they received the commandment from Je|&s;us. See here, in what light, Paul called Je&s;us one Lord, he having given unto men, his commandments and interdictions, and there being only one faith who accompanied with &s;pirit and love, brings to obe|dience, therefore it is &s;piritual, through the word of God, &s;pirit, faith and love; I &s;ay once more &s;pi|ritual, &s;ince every thing was teached and performed by the &s;pirit of God, according to what the apo&s;tle &s;aid, <HI>that we were all baptized through one Spirit to one body,</HI> and as he calls it in another place, <HI>the wa&s;h|ing of regeneration.</HI> But it is not to be under&s;tood, that bapti&s;m, is the regeneration, but I would only prove, how bapti&s;m is nece&s;&s;ary unto regenerated, as a proof and &s;eal, that they were regenerated, or el&s;e circumci&s;ion mu&s;t have been the covenant him|&s;elf; but circumci&s;ion was only an addition to the <PB N="33" REF="045885_0033_10207B261BB1CC48">covenant, as a proof of obedience: So it is with bap|ti&s;m, for St. Paul &s;aid, <HI>that they were clean&s;ed with the wa&s;hing of water by the word;</HI> Ah! dear friends it is not to be under&s;tood, that they were clean&s;ed by the wa&s;hing of water, but by the word, being obedient unto God; as our Saviour &s;aith, <HI>ye are clean, by the word, that I have &s;poken unto you.</HI> We can read likewi&s;e how St. Peter repre&s;ents bapti&s;m after Noah, when the ark was a preparing, wherein few that is eight &s;ouls were &s;aved by water. The like figure whereunto, even bapti&s;m, doth al&s;o now &s;ave us (not the putting away the filth of the fle&s;h, but the an&s;wer of a good con&s;cience towards God.) To under&s;tand this right we mu&s;t take Noah as a figure on Chri&s;t and the ark as his word, and the entrance of Noah the congregation of God; therefore was No|ah called a preacher of righteou&s;ne&s;s, and thus he has prepared the ark by the commandment of God, for him&s;elf and his hou&s;e, therefore the ark was prepared by the word of the Lord and at the &s;ame time repent|ance preached. Thus Chri&s;t as the true preacher of righteou&s;ne&s;s, came into this world, and prepared the ark of the new covenant by the command of his heavenly father, for his children and people and has preached repentance. It was al&s;o with Noah, when he received the divine command, to enter into the ark he and his hou&s;e, he paid obedience unto it, Thus Chri&s;t when the ark of the new te&s;tament was prepa|red, entered into it, and has confirmed and &s;ealed the new covenant by his precious and innocent blood, in obedience to the will of his father. So as the fa|mily of Noah entered it after him obediently, al&s;o the oeconomy of Chri&s;t enters, through obedience and repentance into the ark of the new covenant, and <PB N="34" REF="045885_0034_10207AEC420C23B0">as the waters of the flood ro&s;e and all fle&s;h peri&s;hed, but the water bearing the ark, that Noah and his fa|mily were &s;aved by the water. But it is not quite to be under&s;tood, that they were &s;aved by the water only, Peter calling it a type on bapti&s;m. There|fore the pre&s;ervation of Noah and his family, con|&s;i&s;ted not in the water, but e&s;pecially in obedience, he believing God and preparing the ark by faith; So it is with the bapti&s;m of water, it being commanded in the unalterable will of God, therefore all faithful, will not reject it, but pay obedience, with living faith, unto the word of God, accepting the bapti&s;m with water, &s;o as time and occa&s;ion occurs, for St. Peter &s;aid, <HI>that even bapti&s;m, doth al&s;o now &s;ave us,</HI> (not the putting away of the filth of the fle&s;h, but the an&s;wer of a good con&s;cience towards God.) Here we may &s;ee how explicitly Peter &s;peaks of bapti&s;m, for the &s;ake of our &s;alvation, how nece&s;&s;ary it is to be &s;aved, our &s;alvation con&s;i&s;ting altogether in Chri&s;t and in keeping of his commandments; faith without works being dead, and it being told in the go&s;pel|word, to make u&s;e of this bapti&s;m with water, and who&s;oever is become a new creature and regenerated, keeping all and every thing pre&s;cribed in the go&s;pel, and would refu&s;e the bapti&s;m with water, if he could have it in a chri&s;tian manner, but would reject it, from &s;piritual pride or negligence or &s;elf-conceited righteou&s;ne&s;s, the &s;ame &s;hall know, that he &s;lights the will of God, for our Saviour &s;ays, <HI>that who&s;o|ever tran&s;gre&s;&s;es one, is guilty of the whole.</HI> We find al&s;o, that the &s;elfthoughts of men are of no avail; for Saul erred greatly in tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the word of the Lord, and acting after his own thoughts; what avail had the man of God, in going to Bethel, to <PB N="35" REF="045885_0035_10205705F56F7568">prophe&s;y, when he tran&s;gre&s;&s;eth the word of the Lord, that the lion devoureth him? Therefore St. Peter calls bapti&s;m a &s;aving, faith and obedience be|ing made perfect thereby; he &s;ays al&s;o, "that it does not put away the filth of the fle&s;h, but the an|&s;wer of a good con&s;cience towards God; Water is al&s;o not able to clean&s;e us, but our hearts mu&s;t be clean&s;ed by the word and blood of Chri&s;t, if we pro|&s;trate our&s;elves in humility and true repentance before him, crying for mercy, he then forgives us our &s;ins, out of his free grace, when faith, &s;pirit and love are united together. In this obedience, all true chil|dren of God went and got them&s;elves baptized in the name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, yielding them&s;elves into the communion of &s;aints, renouncing the Devil, deny|ing their own fle&s;h and blood, giving over their own will and devoting them&s;elves wholly, to their hu&s;|band and bridegroom Je&s;us Chri&s;t. And this is the covenant, which all children of God mu&s;t enter into with their God and bridegroom. Water therefore is not the covenant, but a te&s;timony of the covenant and of the true obedience; we find al&s;o, that the apo&s;tles have kept this rule, for St. Paul repeats it, to the Romans that if they &s;hould have been loath, and exhorts them, that they &s;hould know, that &s;o many of them as were baptized into Je&s;us Chri&s;t, were baptized into his death, and tells them, that like as Chri&s;t was rai&s;ed up from the dead, by the glory of the father, even &s;o they al&s;o &s;hould walk in newne&s;s of life: And he admoni&s;hes the Galatians, they hav|ing left the faith and depended upon the law, he &s;hews them again to the new covenant, which they had accepted, when he &s;aid, <HI>whether they did not know, that as many of them as have been baptized in|to <PB N="36" REF="045885_0036_10207AEF4CEFA540">Chri&s;t, have put on Chri&s;t,</HI> he &s;ays, <HI>There is nei|ther Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI> But it is not to be under&s;tood, that they be|came one by the water, but by the quickening faith, &s;pirit and the love of God, who wroughts always their fruit and brings unto obedience, and the water being only the fruit and proof of obedience, where|by faith is confirmed. We find al&s;o how the apo|&s;tle exhorts the Hebrews, <HI>for when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be the fir&s;t principles of the oracles of God, and are become &s;uch as have need of milk, and not of &s;trong meat.</HI> Therefore he &s;ays, <HI>leaving the princi|ples of the doctrine of Chri&s;t, let us go on unto perfec|tion, not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of &s;aith towards God, of the doctrine of bapti&s;m, and of laying on of hands, and of re&s;urrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.</HI> See here how the apo&s;tle exhorteth the faithful, how they have need, that one teach them again, but to continue in the doctrine, he will leave it, and go on unto perfection; &s;o that we can &s;ee, that all epi&s;tles, which the apo&s;tles have wrote, were directed to con|gregations, which they had edified before by the go&s;|pel, exhorting them always, to be &s;tedfa&s;t, in what they had accepted. St. Luke has related us the whole oeconomy of the go&s;pel, that we may &s;ee, how the apo&s;tles have e&s;tabli&s;hed it, by the &s;pirit and word of God. Therefore I acknowledge all in&s;titutions of God, which are outwardly performed in the con|gregation of &s;aints, that they are right and unexcep|tionable, as al&s;o the breaking of the bread, and I acknowledge likewi&s;e, that they are not derived from <PB N="37" REF="045885_0037_10207B2E71D9BBE8">the Jews, but appertain unto the oeconomy of Chri&s;t, &s;ince he has in&s;tituted them him&s;elf, and has com|manded that they &s;hould be exerci&s;ed. But your doctrine &s;aying, that all the&s;e in&s;titutions were brought to their end under the new covenant, and that the apo&s;tles found it expedient to continue them any farther, being derived from the law of Mo&s;es, I mu&s;t ask you, what &s;hall be the rea&s;on, when St. Paul writes to the Hebrews, that he will leave the the principles of the doctrine of Chri&s;t. Was Paul's intention to leave all, the doctrine, and all what he has mentioned there? I think not, or el&s;e he would have continued in in&s;tructing them. But hear! he will leave the principles of the doctrine of Chri&s;t on|ly with them, who were in&s;tructed many times there|in, and received the bapti&s;m already, with them it would have been unnece&s;&s;ary, he having found them remi&s;s therein. Or it is becau&s;e St. Paul had &s;aid <HI>that he had not been &s;ent to baptize, but to preach the go&s;pel;</HI> if he was not &s;ent to baptize, why did he baptize neverthele&s;s? for he &s;ays that he baptized &s;ome among&s;t them. But this is no proof, that he thought bapti&s;m to be unnece&s;&s;ary, for he tells them moreover, <HI>that he hath planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the increa&s;e,</HI> he &s;aid this, about their di&s;ten&s;ions and divi&s;ions among&s;t them, he appre|hending, that they might &s;ay, <HI>he having baptized in his name.</HI> I &s;hall leave it here and refer the cordial reader to the holy Bible, and if it can be proved other|wi&s;e to me from the &s;ame, I am ready to take advice, and if I &s;hould be called up, to give more ground, I am willing in my &s;implene&s;s, to give it after the admonition of St. Peter. But if you acknowledge it to be right, then give the honour unto God, and <PB N="38" REF="045885_0038_10207AF22AE80628">not unto men. I recommend you my dear friends, with me, to the powerful word of his Grace, that he may comfort your hearts and &s;tabli&s;h you in every good word and work, and lead us and every one to the pa&s;ture of his word, and to the right under&s;tand|ing of God, this I wi&s;h you and me, and unto all men, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t Amen.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Of the peaceable Kingdom of</HI> CHRIST.</HEAD>
<P>I MUST add one &s;hort que&s;tion or admonition to you my dear friends! Perceiving in the go&s;pel word and the books of the Prophets, that our Savi|our Je&s;us Chri&s;t, is a peaceable King, and reigns a peaceable kingdom, as the prophet &s;aith: <HI>For unto us a child is born, unto us a &s;on is given: and the go|vernment &s;hall be upon his &s;houlder, and his name &s;halt be called, Wonderful, Coun&s;ellor, the mighty God, the everla&s;ting Father, the Prince of Peace.</HI> He &s;ays moreover, <HI>that they will turn their &s;words into plough|&s;hears and their &s;pears into pruning-hooks, and they &s;hall know of no wars; the wolf al&s;o &s;hall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard &s;hall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion, and the fatling toge|ther, and a little child &s;hall lead them. And the cow and the bear &s;hall feed, their young ones &s;hall lie down together: and the lion &s;hall eat &s;traw like the ox. And the &s;uckling child &s;hall play on the hole of the a&s;p, and the weaned child &s;hall put his hand on the cocka|trice's den. They &s;hall not hurt nor de&s;troy in all my ho|ly mountain.</HI> Many more pa&s;&s;ages could be quoted from the books of the Prophets of this peaceable king Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and of his peaceable kingdom and church, how he will e&s;tabli&s;h right on earth and the i&s;les &s;hall wait for his law. This king of kings in com|ing into this world, was not born in a royal palace, but a &s;table mu&s;t be his inn, he was al&s;o always per&s;ecut|ed, bani&s;hed, hated and mocked at from his youth, and came at la&s;t to the ignominious death on the cro&s;s as a cur&s;e and expiatory &s;acrifice for all the world. But <PB N="40" REF="045885_0040_10207AF3B25256E8">&s;ince we can find in no place, that he even &s;ought revenge, or revenged him&s;elf, but he teaches us, that it was &s;aid by them in old times, "an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, and thou &s;halt love thy neigh|bour, and hate thine enemy;" the Son of the Al|mighty tells us the contrary, &s;aying, <HI>but I &s;ay unto you, that ye re&s;i&s;t not evil: but who&s;oever &s;hall &s;mite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other al&s;o, and love your enemies, ble&s;s them that cur&s;e you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which di&s;pite|fully u&s;e you, and per&s;ecute you; and if any man will &s;ue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak al&s;o.</HI> Je&s;us Chri&s;t having gone before us, in this doctrine, life and example, and has com|manded us, to follow his &s;aid example and has deni|ed all revenge and re&s;i&s;tance, which he has &s;hewn and manife&s;ted in his go&s;pel doctrine and kingdom of grace, and has told us to bear all afflictions where|with he vi&s;its us, and not to revenge our&s;elves, but leave vengeance unto him. You &s;aying in your pub|lications, that all revenge was forbidden under the new covenant, which I confe&s;s al&s;o: I mu&s;t put this que&s;tion to you, where war, is more and earne&s;tly forbidden as going to law, re&s;i&s;t force by force and to be elected into offices; and if we for the go&s;pel and Chri&s;t's &s;ake, cannot hold any office, how &s;hould we be capable, to elect others into offices, does not Je&s;us &s;ay, "that his kingdom was not from this world, and that he would appoint unto us a king|dom, as his father hath appointed unto him." You denying totally all warfare, but make u&s;e of going to law, by re&s;i&s;ting force by force, almo&s;t as much and more as people of other denominations. I mu&s;t ask you once more, where the one is more forbid|den <PB N="41" REF="045885_0041_10207B3185240658">than the other. I confe&s;s al&s;o that there are two kingdoms, Chri&s;t &s;aying, that his kingdom was not from this world. There we find, that the kingdom of Chri&s;t is different from the kingdoms of this world, as he &s;aith to his di&s;ciples, "the kings of the Gen|tiles exerci&s;e lord&s;hip over them; and they that ex|erci&s;e authority upon them are called benefactors. But ye &s;hall not be &s;o: but that is greate&s;t among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief as he that doth &s;erve." And again when the revenge of the law took place with his di&s;cipies, that they &s;aid unto him, <HI>wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and con&s;ume them, even as Elias did?</HI> Our Saviour rebuked them and &s;aid, <HI>ye know not what manner of &s;pirit ye are of.</HI> There we can &s;ee how Chri&s;t has commanded his di&s;ciples, to keep peace: when he &s;aid, <HI>Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, I give unto you. By this &s;hall all men know, that ye are my di&s;ciples, if ye have love one to another. Great|er love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his brethren.</HI> Since it is clear and mani|fe&s;t, that the kingdom of Chri&s;t is a peaceable king|dom, but men being bad from nature, with&s;tanding the peace of the Almighty and will not &s;ubmit them|&s;elves under the &s;cepter of his word. Therefore all men who will not &s;ubmit under the &s;cepter of the Almighty, they mu&s;t &s;ubmit them&s;elves under the &s;cepter of the kings and princes of this world, which were ordained of God the king of kings and lord of lords, to reign the kingdom of this world. There|fore all and every one &s;tands under the obligation to pay allegiance and obedience unto them, and to a|void, all rebellion or con&s;piracy, that might be plot|ed <PB N="42" REF="045885_0042_10207AF7ED5116E8">again&s;t them; but not for the &s;ake of kings or princes, but for God's &s;ake, they being ordained of God to their admini&s;trations; children of God and regenerated, and who have followed the &s;pirit of God and have voluntarily &s;ubmitted them&s;elves un|der the &s;cepter of his word, have no further obliga|tion to be obedient unto them as in &s;o far, as their law are not contrary to the word of God, for it is ju&s;t and right to obey God more, then unto men. This peace being offered unto all men, and unto all without exception, repentance was preached through Chri&s;t, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> in the go&s;pel word, therefore no man <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">, be he Jew, Gentile or Turk, or of what <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">, nation or denomination he may be, be they <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> or of a mean de&s;cent, rich or poor, king or prince, they were all called unto repentance, for God is no re&s;pecter of per&s;ons: Unto all was al|&s;o given, one and the &s;ame law and word, for he does not care the power of the mighty, nor is he a&s;hamed, of the lowne&s;s of the poor; Therefore who&s;oever repents, pro&s;trating him&s;elf with a con|trite heart, before the maje&s;ty of the Almighty in humility and &s;ubmitting him&s;elf, in true regenerati|on, quits &s;in, and goes out of every thing, that is again&s;t God and his word, he may be who he will, the &s;ame will obtain this free grace. <HI>Who&s;oever comes unto me, I will in no wi&s;e reject him, and come unto me, all ye that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you re&s;t,</HI> for the foundation of God &s;tand|eth &s;ure, having this &s;eal, "The Lord knoweth them, that are his. And let every one, that nameth the name of Chri&s;t, depart from iniquity." As to your addre&s;&s;es, which you &s;end to kings and princes, I can at this time &s;ee no other motive in it, as that <PB N="43" REF="045885_0043_10207B338C3C56E8">they are meant to flatter with, and to obtain applau&s;e and honour before the world. I bid you farewell dear friends, and the God of peace will ble&s;s our hearts. To him be prai&s;e, honour and power, now and evermore, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
