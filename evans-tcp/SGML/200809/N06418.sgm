<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>FRIENDLY READER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MAY it be remembered that when <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> that eminent and faithful Servant of the Lord, even the Mediator of the fir&s;t Covenant, having been, by divine Commi&s;&s;ion and A&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;ignally and &s;ucce&s;sfully in&s;trumental in delivering poor &s;ighing and groaning <HI>I&s;rael</HI> out of the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Bondage, and was now bringing them on their Way towards the Land of Promi&s;e, flowing with Milk and Honey, being right &s;en&s;ible how liable People are (if not truly watchful) who have been very humble while in Adver&s;ity and Affliction, to become carele&s;s and forgetful of the Lord and his Succour in their foregoing Trials, when Pro&s;|perity &s;miles upon them, gave them the following timely Precautions and &s;ea&s;onable Charges, worthy of their and our due Ob&s;ervation and Notice, &s;ay|ing, <HI>Hear,</HI> O I&s;rael, <HI>the Lord our God is one Lord. And thou &s;halt love the Lord thy God with all thine Heart, and with all thy Soul, and with all thy Might. And the&s;e Words which I com|mand thee this Day &s;hall be in thine Heart.
<PB N="iv" REF="008146_0003_102E3BA88DA49590">
And thou &s;halt teach them diligently unto thy Children, and &s;halt talk of them when thou &s;it|te&s;t in thine Hou&s;e, and when thou walke&s;t by the Way, and when thou lie&s;t down, and when thou ri&s;e&s;t up. And thou &s;halt bind them for a Sign upon thine Hand, and they &s;hall be as Frontlets between thine Eyes. And thou &s;halt write them upon the Po&s;ts of thy Hou&s;e, and on thy Gates. And it &s;hall be when the Lord thy God &s;hall have brought thee into the Land which he &s;ware unto thy Fathers, to</HI> Abraham, <HI>to</HI> I&s;aac, <HI>and to</HI> Jacob, <HI>to give thee great and goodly Cities which thou builded&s;t not, and Hou&s;es full of all good Things which thou filled&s;t not, and Wells digged which thou dig|ged&s;t not, Vineyards and Olive-Trees which thou planted&s;t not; when thou &s;halt have eaten and be full, then beware le&s;t thou forget the Lord, which brought thee forth out of the Land of</HI> Egypt, <HI>from the Hou&s;e of Bondage.</HI> Deut. <HI>vi. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.</HI></P>
<P>But alas; though <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> during the Life of <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> and of the Elders that overlived <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> were pre&s;erved in &s;ome good Degree within the Bounds of good Order and Moderation, yet too many of the &s;ucceeding Generation took undue Liberties, and <HI>Je&s;hurun,</HI> waxed fat, and kicked. Have not we ju&s;t Cau&s;e to fear, that this is too much the Ca&s;e with many of the Profe&s;&s;ors of the ble&s;&s;ed Truth in the&s;e Days, wherein &s;o great a Calm and Quiet, I &s;ay, in &s;o gracious a Tole|ration as is now mercifully enjoyed by us?</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="008146_0004_102E3BAA2A0B0408">We have now a large &s;ucceeding Generation coming up in our Society, but too few of them growing up in the real Work of Regeneration, and Obedience to the holy Spirit, their profe&s;&s;ed Principle, whence divers undue Liberties in <HI>Speech, Habit,</HI> and <HI>Deportment,</HI> quite incon&s;i&s;tent with our &s;aid Principle, are run into. Some are &s;eemingly &s;oaring aloft as into the <HI>Air,</HI> as though they were above the Reproofs and Teachings of the meek Spi|rit of humble <HI>Je&s;us;</HI> others are grovelling as in the <HI>Earth,</HI> and they are hiding their Talents, tho' perhaps wrapped up in a Napkin of &s;eeming or moral Righteou&s;ne&s;s: Others &s;eem neither to be on the Wing in the <HI>airy Regions,</HI> nor yet choaked with gaping and gra&s;ping after the <HI>Earth,</HI> but wrapped up, and, as it were, lulled in that carele&s;s State of Indolence and ba&s;e Neutrality, &s;omewhat like the Inhabitants of <HI>Lai&s;h,</HI> and the &s;ecure <HI>Zido|nians,</HI> as if they were not accountable Creatures for any Steward&s;hips, either in Temporals or Spi|rituals: Others, again, are in the other Extream, pur&s;uing the World as if it were their <HI>&s;ummum Bonum,</HI> or chiefe&s;t Good, launching out into Mul|tiplicity of Bu&s;ine&s;s, as a Hor&s;e into the Battle; mean while neglecting their re&s;pective &s;piritual Talents, and con&s;equently the greate&s;t and far mo&s;t important Bu&s;ine&s;s of their Day and Gene|ration, and for want of minding the Directions of the great <HI>PILOT,</HI> even the Spirit of Truth they profe&s;s, they are often driven into, and (as I may &s;ay) mi&s;erably &s;hipwrecked upon, that &s;candalous Rock of <HI>In&s;olvency;</HI> and although &s;ome of our great, bu&s;tling, exten&s;ive Trade&s;men may not,
<PB N="vi" REF="008146_0005_102E3BADBAB59250">
perhaps, as to their outward Affairs, mi&s;carry, yes, alas! they are often &s;o much involved and taken up with the Hurries, Projects and Cares about Things of this Life, that they prove lamentably deficient in tho&s;e mo&s;t material and weighty Parti|culars, viz. <HI>In working out their own Salvation with Fear and Trembling, and in glorifying God in their re&s;pective Services in the Church, and in their own Families.</HI> Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e la&s;t Ob&s;ervations, there are, I hope, &s;ome, though too few, exten&s;ive Trade&s;men, who are very care|ful that their Hearts may have Room in them for the <HI>pure Religion and undefiled before God and the Father,</HI> and that the Temple may not be un|&s;uitably crowded with <HI>Money-Changers</HI> and their <HI>Tables;</HI> but that their Hearts (though &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;arily bu&s;y in Commerce) may be pre&s;erved really a <HI>Hou&s;e of Prayer.</HI> The&s;e religious Trade&s;|men are truly worthy of double Honour, remarkable for their prudent and <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Conduct and For|titude, not &s;uffering <HI>Mammon</HI> to be their Ma&s;ter, but keeping him in his Place, at a proper Di&s;|tance, as their Servant; &s;o they are in a Capacity to &s;erve God, their Lord and Ma&s;ter, and chiefe&s;t Sovereign, and al&s;o his Church and People in their re&s;pective Places. This Kind of honourable Trade&s;|men, being above all other Things concerned to improve their Talents of Grace, dare not ea&s;ily omit attending their religious Meetings, either on the Fir&s;t-days, or other Days of the Week; yea, &s;ome have even <HI>&s;hut up their Shops</HI> during the Meeting-time on the Week-days, le&s;t their Shops <HI>&s;hould have &s;hut them up,</HI> and debarred them
<PB N="vii" REF="008146_0006_102E3BB0A34E6420">
from the Enjoyment of Chri&s;t's Company with the two or three met in his Name: May not we account the&s;e like faithful <HI>Abraham,</HI> who &s;aid to his Ser|vants, upon a weighty Occa&s;ion, <HI>Abide ye here, and I and the Lad will go yonder and wor&s;hip, and come again to you.</HI> When this Sort of highly valuable Trade&s;men are occa&s;ionally called Abroad, and are riding their Circuits among their Chap|men, they endeavour, I believe, to get to as many Meetings, even on the Week-days, as they well can: The&s;e have good Ground to hope for and expect the Ble&s;&s;ing of kind Providence to attend their hone&s;t Endeavours.</P>
<P>We have al&s;o Ground to fear, that too many under our Name keep and frequent <HI>un&s;uitable Company,</HI> taking more Plea&s;ure in the Society of <HI>Wine-bibbers,</HI> at the Tavern or Alehou&s;e, than with the two or three at the Meeting, waiting for the Ap|pearing of ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Je&s;us.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, another afflicting &s;orrowful Di&s;order, and, I fear, a growing Evil, in the&s;e Times of Liberty and Ea&s;e from Per&s;ecution, is <HI>Mixt-Marriages,</HI> which generally u&s;her confu&s;ion, Trou|ble and Perplexity into Families and the Society, much grieving, and almo&s;t (if not quite) breaking the Hearts of good Parents, &s;o that many anxious Fathers and Mothers, ob&s;erving with Sorrow the wide Cour&s;es which many are taking, do, in Effect, frequently revolve in their pen&s;ive Hearts that mournful Query of &s;olicitous <HI>Rebekah</HI> of old, &mdash;

<HI>If my Child or Children do as &s;uch and &s;uch have done, what good &s;hall my Life do me!</HI></P>
<P>Again, 'tis much to be feared there are &s;ome (I wi&s;h I had Ground to &s;ay there are none) guilty of that ab&s;olute and ab&s;urd Contradiction of profe&s;&s;ing the peaceable Spirit of meek <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> the King of <HI>Salem,</HI> and the Prince of Peace, and at the &s;ame time are <HI>litigious</HI> and <HI>contentious Per&s;ons,</HI> &s;eem|ing to delight in <HI>Strife,</HI> and &s;triving for <HI>Ma&s;tery,</HI> either in the Church, or among Neighbours, or, it may be, &s;ometimes both. &mdash; The Eyes of the People have long been, and &s;till are, upon us, and con&s;idering the Extent of our high Profe&s;&s;ion, have, and do make, their Remarks upon us, and can quickly ob&s;erve when our Conduct is con&s;i&s;tent with our profe&s;&s;ed Principles, and when repugnant thereto, either in <HI>Habit, Speech</HI> or <HI>Deportment.</HI> Have not &s;ome been ready to make the following Ob&s;erva|tions? Such an one is an <HI>hone&s;t primitive Quaker,</HI> his or her Dre&s;s, Addre&s;s, and whole Conduct, agree to what he or &s;he profe&s;&s;eth. But &s;uch and &s;uch are <HI>modern, fa&s;hionable Quakers,</HI> they pro|fe&s;s the <HI>Spirit,</HI> yet it is plain they live after the <HI>Fle&s;h;</HI> &s;o they are but <HI>Nominal Quakers.</HI></P>
<P>Now ina&s;much as the Continuance of the above mentioned Errors (and all others) are owing to, and cau&s;ed by, Mens &s;lighting and di&s;regarding the &s;piritual Appearance and refining Work of Chri&s;t in their Hearts, who is now come in Spirit to put an End to Sin, and to fini&s;h Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, to make Reconciliation, to bring in everla&s;ting Righteou&s;ne&s;s;

and ina&s;much as he hath promi&s;ed his ble&s;&s;ed Pre|&s;ence to tho&s;e who, though very few in Number, meet in his Name, I have in much good Will wrote the following Lines for the Encouragement of the Faithful and Diligent, and for the rou&s;ing, if po&s;&s;i|ble, the Remi&s;s and Negligent, to that highly nece&s;&s;ary and profitable Duty of rightly attending religious Meetings, where he hath promi&s;ed to <HI>be in the Mid&s;t of &s;uch Meeters:</HI> So that Mens <HI>neglect|ing</HI> being the Cau&s;e of the&s;e their continued Di&s;|orders (as Chri&s;t &s;aid, &mdash; <HI>While Men &s;lept, an Enemy did Mi&s;chief in the Field</HI>) this being di&s;continued, and a vigilant Diligence being u&s;ed in the Room thereof, that evil Cau&s;e being thus taken away, the evil Effects thereof might con&s;equently cea&s;e.</P>
<P>But in ca&s;e, after the&s;e my hone&s;t Endeavours and Labours of Love, I &s;hould be blamed for making the following Remarks, or producing particular In&s;tances of the bad Effects commonly attending the for&s;aking of religious Meetings, as though I expo&s;ed the Weak|ne&s;s &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in our Society; I a&s;&s;ure thee, <HI>friendly Reader,</HI> I am far from upbraiding any of my Friends with their Failures, but in good Will to the Cau&s;e, and the Souls of all, I found my&s;elf en|gaged to write &s;omething on the&s;e <HI>Neglects</HI> and <HI>Di&s;|orders,</HI> and the pernicious Con&s;equences thereof, which long before I penned the&s;e Lines, were too noto|rious, being plainly expo&s;ed by the very Per&s;ons them&s;elves, found in the Errors &s;poken of here, and in the &s;ub&s;equent Lines; &s;o that the Remarks made, and the In&s;tances produced of the Deficiencies

of any of the Profe&s;&s;ors of Truth, proceed not from <HI>ill Will,</HI> or were hidden Things heretofore, and now brought to Light, but alas! have long been con|&s;picuous and noted by many.

<Q>And thencefor|ward, per&s;evering under an awful Regard to that gracious Hand that had &s;o vi&s;ited him, he grew in Grace and the &s;aving Knowledge of God; who being of poor and low Cir|cum&s;tances, as to Things of this Life, was oblig'd to labour hard for his Bread, and, being a Taylor by Trade, was often obliged to work at other Peoples Hou&s;es, yet could not be ea&s;y to omit Week-day Meetings, but laying a&s;ide his Work, was engag'd to walk often a pretty Way to Week-day Meetings; yet &s;uch was his Diligence and Indu&s;try be|fore and after the &s;aid Meetings, that tho&s;e he work'd for de&s;ir'd no Allowance or Abate|ment for the Time &s;pent on Account of the &s;aid Meetings. Some Time after this he married a young Woman convinc'd of the Truth a little while before. Now the Storms of Per&s;ecution ro&s;e high, and having now and then a Meeting in his Hou&s;e (being him&s;elf in the mini&s;terial Capacity) they cheerfully &s;uffer'd the Spoiling of their Goods for Truth's Sake, and were &s;tripp'd very bare as to Temporals, having two &s;mall Children, and his Wife with Child of the third; yet keeping faithful, according to the be&s;t of their Knowledge and Ability, and con&s;equently not daring to be remi&s;s or indifferent in that im|portant Duty of attending religious Meetings, they were ble&s;&s;ed every Way, and their little Oil and Meal were thereby render'd capable
