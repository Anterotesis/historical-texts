<HEAD>THE Doctrine of Univer&s;al Salvation Examined and Refuted.</HEAD>
<P>SOLOMON, after a va&s;t and exten&s;ive &s;earch into the nature of things, &s;ays, <HI>lo, this only have I found, that God made man upright; but they have &s;ought out many inven|tions.</HI> How many he could not tell, nor any other man. Had the inhabitants of New-England been told, ten years ago, that &s;aid doctrine would &s;oon be preached up, and have an exten&s;ive &s;pread among them, who could have believed it? Yet this is now become a notorious fact, by the following means: Mr. John Murray, from England, having preached for &s;ome time in places &s;outh of New-York, came from thence into New-England in the fall of the year 1772; and has preached in the&s;e parts to the pre&s;ent time. For a while he concealed his de&s;ign under many good words and fair &s;peeches; and when he began plain|ly to preach general &s;alvation, his greate&s;t admirers rather wi&s;hed than believed the doctrine to be true. At length they procured the re-printing of a pamphlet from London, in 1779, which was privately di&s;per&s;ed in the country, and has intangled many &s;ouls. Since which Mr. Elhanan Winche&s;ter, who was born near Bo&s;ton, and, by his itinerations from thence to South-Carolina, had obtained an exten&s;ive fame for being a power|ful and &s;ucce&s;sful preacher of the go&s;pel, has fallen in with &s;aid doctrine, under another form, which has cau&s;ed its in|fluence to extend much farther than it had before. And its advocates now glory in it as unan&s;werable, becau&s;e a di&s;tinct an&s;wer thereto has not appeared among us. A &s;ight of this, and not hearing that any others were engaged therein, has con|&s;trained me to offer my mite in the affair; hoping that it may encourage and excite others to &s;tep forward in the cau&s;e of truth to better purpo&s;e.</P>

<Q>UNION: Or, a Treati&s;e of the Con&s;anguinity and Affinity between Chri&s;t and his Church. By James
<PB N="4" REF="017464_0004_0FA12169EFF20858">
Relly.</Q>
UNION is the life of the univer&s;e, and to act again&s;t it is an infinite evil; but though his title is &s;o impor|tant, yet if the treati&s;e &s;hould be found to contain a &s;cene of di&s;union and confu&s;ion, all lovers of truth and peace will &s;ee cau&s;e to reject it. Whether it be &s;o or not, we are now to en|quire. The rule he pre&s;cribes for us to go by is thus expre&s;&s;ed: Says he,
<Q>if mankind have any true notion of ju&s;tice and equity, though but in the &s;malle&s;t degree, then what is contrary to <HI>this,</HI> is much <HI>more &s;o</HI> to God, who&s;e ju&s;tice and truth is infinite, pure and eternal.</Q>
<HI>Preface,</HI> p. 9.
<Q>This &s;imple voice of nature differs from revelation only as the le&s;|&s;er light which rules the night, differs from the greater which rules the day. If it is po&s;&s;ible tho&s;e our ideas of the divine perfections &s;hould be wrong, then have we <HI>no rule,</HI> whereby to di&s;cern between good and evil.</Q>
<HI>Book,</HI> p. 45. If he meant that, like the moon, we are always to receive light from the &s;un, and to let the &s;ame &s;hine before others, in word and practice, Je&s;us has inculcated this duty upon us in a clear manner. But to imagine that our ideas of the divine perfec|tions may not be entirely wrong, or that, if they were &s;o, we &s;hould have <HI>no rule</HI> left to correct and direct us, is a mo&s;t dan|gerous delu&s;ion. Mat. vi. 23. 1 John ii. 4&mdash;11, and iii. 20, 21. Jude 10. All men of &s;en&s;e know, that <HI>written laws and contracts,</HI> which &s;hall be their own interpreters, are very ne|ce&s;&s;ary in the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice; and that a <HI>di&s;cretionary</HI> power ought not to be allowed to the be&s;t of judges, without great caution and circum&s;pection. And if <HI>a gift doth blind the eyes of the wi&s;e, and pervert the words of the righteous,</HI> how can debtors and criminals be &s;uitable judges in their own cau&s;es? And the&s;e are the ca&s;es before us.</P>
<P>Prote&s;tants, as this author ob&s;erves, generally hold,
<Q>that man, being a debtor and tran&s;gre&s;&s;or, and unable to &s;ave him&s;elf, Je&s;us Chri&s;t became his <HI>&s;urety,</HI> under an engage|ment to pay his debts, and to bear his puni&s;hment; the <HI>equi|ty</HI> of which is generally re&s;olved into the <HI>&s;overeignty</HI> of God, or accounted for from the willingne&s;s of Chri&s;t (as an inde|pendent DIVINE PERSON) to &s;uffer in the &s;inner's &s;tead.</Q>
<HI>Preface,</HI> p. 9. The&s;e ideas Relly rejects,
<Q>1. Becau&s;e (&s;ays he) contrary to truth, which declareth that every man &s;hall die for his own &s;in. 2. It is contrary to <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> to afflict the innocent: To puni&s;h and de&s;troy him is <HI>cruelty</HI> and <HI>inju&s;tice.</HI></Q>
<HI>Book,</HI> p. 3.4. To confirm the&s;e &s;trange a&s;&s;ertions, he &s;ays,
<Q>I know not of any human laws, which admit of &s;urety&s;hip in capital offences; and &s;in is not only a debt, for which
<PB N="5" REF="017464_0005_0FA1216AAFC2CE80">
&s;urety&s;hip is &s;ometimes admitted, but a tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, a crime, capital in the highe&s;t &s;en&s;e, only atoned for by the &s;hedding of blood; by the death, yea, by the eternal death of the &s;inner; which ju&s;tice mu&s;t inflict, before it can be properly &s;atisfied; nor can it po&s;&s;ibly admit of a &s;urety here.</Q>
P. 5. Truth is here held in unrighteou&s;ne&s;s to a mo&s;t &s;ur|prizing degree! The nature of &s;in, and its ju&s;t de&s;ert, are well expre&s;&s;ed; but how daring is it for a guilty criminal to a&s;&s;ert, that JEHOVAH cannot po&s;&s;ibly admit of a &s;urety here! Did he never read, that <HI>Je&s;us was made a</HI> SURETY? <HI>Wherefore he is able al&s;o to &s;ave them to the uttermo&s;t, that come unto God by him, &s;eeing he ever liveth to make interce&s;&s;ion for them.</HI> Heb. vii. 23, 25. If men &s;hould admit of &s;ureties in capital ca&s;es, a double injury would en&s;ue; namely, the lo&s;s of an innocent per&s;on out of the community, and the continuance of a guilty one therein, who would be likely to do more mi&s;chief him&s;elf, and al&s;o to encourage the like in others; which are &s;ufficient rea|&s;ons why they do not admit of &s;ureties in &s;uch ca&s;es. But infinite wi&s;dom has cau&s;ed mercy and truth, righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace, &s;o to meet in Je&s;us, who had power to lay down his life, and power to take it again (John x. 18.) that no lo&s;s is &s;u&s;tain|ed to the community; while the evil of &s;in appears greater in his &s;ufferings, than it could have done in the eternal damnation of all the human race. O! how gloriou&s;ly does a true fight of him relieve the guilty polluted criminal, rai&s;ing his &s;oul up to union and grateful obedience, while it demon&s;trates that &s;in cannot go unpuni&s;hed, &s;ince it could not e&s;cape the vengeance of the Father, when found upon his darling Son! But how far was our opponent from &s;uch views, union, or obedience?</P>
<P>Becau&s;e Adam was created with the whole of human nature in him, and after Eve was formed &s;he became one fle&s;h with him, called by one name, and under one law, Relly &s;ays,
<Q>&s;imilar with this, the church exi&s;ted in Chri&s;t; <HI>according as he hath cho&s;en us in him, before the foundation of the world,</HI> having this purpo&s;e and grace given us in him, before the world began. The man and woman, under this con&s;idera|tion, had but one name: He called <HI>their name Adam.</HI> So Chri&s;t and his church in this union bear one name; both are called the Lord our righteou&s;ne&s;s. He, Jer. xxiii. 6; &s;he, Jer. xxxiii. 16: We the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God in him. 2 Cor. v. 21. The Lord God covenanting with Adam, as the head of the earthly creation, as having the woman in him&s;elf, drew a <HI>figure</HI> of his covenant with Chri&s;t, as having the church exi&s;ting in him, he as the head engaging for his
<PB N="6" REF="017464_0006_0FA1216B7010CF40">
members; as the hu&s;band for his wife, as the king for his &s;ubjects, as the root for its branches,</Q>
&amp;c. P. 11, 12.</P>
<P>How &s;urprizing is this! Union in nature, prior to choice, and union by choice and free contracts, are as di&s;tinct things as any in the world; yet here they are <HI>confounded</HI> together, and his whole &s;cheme is built upon this <HI>confu&s;ion.</HI> The original of all union is the SACRED THREE, who are eternally one in nature, prior to any idea of choice, and ever freely act accord|ing to that nature. In &s;ix days he created the heavens and the earth, and all things therein, <HI>by the word of his power.</HI> Of the earth it is well &s;aid, that,
<Q>ever &s;ince the week of creative wonders, God hath ordered all the&s;e creatures to fill the world with inhabitants of their own kind; and they have obeyed him in a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of almo&s;t &s;ix thou&s;and years. And it is evident, that he has kept a re&s;erve of <HI>&s;overeignty</HI> to him&s;elf, and has di&s;played the en&s;igns of it in &s;ome im|portant hours. Nature is the art of God, and it mu&s;t for|ever be unrivalled by the &s;ons of men. <HI>Yet man can produce a man.</HI> Admirable effect, but artle&s;s cau&s;e! A poor, li|mited, inferior agent! The plant and the brute in this mat|ter are his rivals, and his equals too. The human parent and the parent-bird form their own images with equal &s;kill, and are confined each to his work.&mdash;Let the athei&s;t then exert his utmo&s;t &s;tretch of under&s;tanding, let him try the force of all his mechanical powers, to compo&s;e the wing of a butterfly, or the meane&s;t feather of a &s;parrow; let him labour and &s;weat, and faint, and acknowledge his own weakne&s;s; then let him turn his eye, look at tho&s;e wondrous compo&s;ures, his &s;on or his little daughter; and when their infant tongues &s;hall enquire of him, and &s;ay, <HI>father, who made us?</HI> let him not dare to a&s;&s;ume the honor of that work to him&s;elf, but teach the young creatures that <HI>there is a God,</HI> and fall down on his face, and repent and wor&s;hip <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wa<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ts's Philo&s;ophical E&s;&s;ay</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>The man I am an&s;wering was very far from &s;uch di&s;tinct views or di&s;po&s;itions; for having quoted 1 Cor. xi. 11, and 1 Tim. ii. 14, he &s;ays of Adam and Eve,
<Q>his union unto her made it equitable for the cur&s;e and condemnation of her folly to fall upon him; and that <HI>without</HI> the con&s;ideration of <HI>his con&s;ent</HI> and compliance with her. In like manner, Chri&s;t the hu&s;band <HI>was not deceived</HI>; but his wife, the church, being deceived, was in the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. Yet as the union was &s;uch, that Chri&s;t was not without the church, nor the
<PB N="7" REF="017464_0007_0FA1216C2ECDD3A8">
church without him <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Had the creature a real exi&s;tence from eternity!</NOTE>, <HI>at any time,</HI> it was equitable for her cur&s;e and condemnation to fall upon him.</Q>
P. 13. To which I an&s;wer, that to pretend that after Eve was formed &s;he became one fle&s;h with Adam, without mutual choice, is un|&s;criptural and irrational; and it is more &s;o, to imagine that her &s;in could have become his without his con&s;ent; and to de|clare, that our &s;in and its cur&s;e could have fallen upon Chri&s;t, without his free choice, is &s;uch an ab&s;urdity and &s;uch bla&s;phe|my as will forever want a name! A man cannot be made <HI>one fle&s;h</HI> with a harlot without his con&s;ent; but he that is joined to the Lord is <HI>one &s;pirit.</HI> 1 Cor. ii. 16, 17. And though men commit <HI>adultery,</HI> yet Chri&s;t never will. No &s;oul can ever be married to him, till it is delivered from pre-engagements. Naturally we are all <HI>wedded</HI> to <HI>do and live,</HI> as much as ever a wife was to an hu&s;band; but we mu&s;t become dead to that, and that to us, in order to be married to Chri&s;t. The conceit of &s;ome life in us, at lea&s;t to make an hone&s;t cry for mercy in di&s;tre&s;s, is never given up, till the holy Spirit demon&s;trates to the &s;oul, that the <HI>law is holy, and the commandment holy, and ju&s;t, and good</HI>; and that in us there is <HI>no good thing.</HI> In this way <HI>&s;in revives, and we die.</HI> By the body of Chri&s;t, <HI>that al&s;o becomes dead wherein we were held.</HI> Viewing how he bear our &s;ins in his own body on the tree, our imaginary life expires; and the proce&s;s again&s;t us is al&s;o at an end; &s;ince Chri&s;t is <HI>the end of the law for righteou&s;ne&s;s, to every one that believeth.</HI> Thus we become dead to the law by the body of Chri&s;t, that we &s;hould be married to him who was rai&s;ed from the dead, that we &s;hould bring forth fruit unto God; we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held, that we &s;hould &s;erve in <HI>newne&s;s of &s;pirit, and not in the oldne&s;s of the letter.</HI> Rom. vii. 1&mdash;12, and x. 4. The oldne&s;s of the letter gives no en|couragement to come to God, without holine&s;s and obedience in our&s;elves; the newne&s;s of the &s;pirit teacheth &s;ouls to come through Je&s;us, for pardon, clean&s;ing and &s;trength to live to him. According to the oldne&s;s of the letter, every defect in us lays a bar in the way of coming; but by the newne&s;s of the &s;pirit, every &s;in and every enemy are &s;o many rea&s;ons to move us to <HI>come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy; and find grace to help in time of need.</HI> Heb. iv. 16.</P>
<P>The powers of thinking and choo&s;ing are e&s;&s;ential to the na|ture of all immortal &s;pirits; without which no idea can be form|ed of their exi&s;tence; therefore two &s;pirits cannot po&s;&s;ibly be|come one without choice; and 'tis but a <HI>filthy dream</HI> for any to
<PB N="8" REF="017464_0008_0FA1216CF07F4C68">
entertain &s;uch a notion. Yet Relly &s;ays;
<Q>man being the ve&s;|&s;el marred between the potter's hands, was not rejected, but here was made another and better ve&s;&s;el; where the nature, once &s;poiled by &s;in, was born into the world pure and &s;potle&s;s, and called the Son of God.</Q>
P. 27.
<Q>As the head was never without the body, nor the body without the head, in the Lord, the body hath always been, by union with the head, entitled unto all the ble&s;&s;ings, honors, and glories thereof. If it is not true until our believing, and by means thereof, then doth believing make that a truth which was not a truth, and faith creates its own object, and then embraces it. This looks like the heathen idolatry, fir&s;t making their gods, and then tru&s;ting in them.</Q>
P. 35. This is a darling topic with him; but I am quite willing to meet him, and to try the matter out fairly upon his own ground; in order whereto we mu&s;t remember the difference there is betwixt faith and hope. Hope is fixed upon promi&s;ed ble&s;&s;ings; but faith regards all revealed truth, be the &s;ame de&s;irable or terrible to us. The creation, &s;upport, government, and final di&s;&s;olution of this world, by the <HI>word of God,</HI> are all objects of faith; as al&s;o are everla&s;ting puni&s;hments to the wicked, and eternal life to the righteous. But of this the <HI>&s;coffers</HI> of the&s;e la&s;t days are <HI>willingly ignorant.</HI> Heb. i. 3, and xi. 1&mdash;6. 2 Pet. ii. 3&mdash;7. Becau&s;e the word go&s;pel &s;ignifies good news, they imagine that none preach it, but &s;uch as prophecy <HI>&s;mooth things,</HI> and cry, <HI>peace, peace,</HI> to car|nal men. I&s;ai. xxx. 8&mdash;11. Jer. viii. 11. The latter part of the pamphlet before us turns entirely upon this point; the de|ceit whereof is ea&s;ily di&s;covered.</P>
<P>For to hear of the heaven &s;erpent was very good news to the poi&s;oned I&s;raelites, and &s;o was the city of refuge to the man&s;lay|er; as pardon al&s;o was to criminals <HI>ju&s;tly condemned,</HI> and free forgivene&s;s to debtors who had <HI>nothing to pay.</HI> But, according to the above rea&s;oning, they mu&s;t have been told, that health was as really theirs before they looked as afterwards, or el&s;e looking made the object they looked to! John iii. 14, 15. Safety is as truly yours before you fly as afterwards, or el&s;e fleeing to the city, makes the city you fly to, which had no exi&s;t|ence before! Heb. vi. 18. Pardon and forgivene&s;s were as really yours before you received them as &s;ince, or el&s;e giving in to the equity of the indictment and the accounts, and receiving a di&s;charge therefrom, created the whole affair, which had no exi&s;tence before! P&s;alm li. 3&mdash;8. Luke vii. 41, 42. Yet, &s;peaking of Adam and his po&s;terity, Relly &s;ays,
<Q>his &s;in, its cur&s;e and fruit, was theirs, before they felt it, knew it, or ever
<PB N="9" REF="017464_0009_0FA1216DAEE956A0">
were con&s;cious of exi&s;tence. Thus, by one man's di&s;obedi|ence, many were made &s;inners. In like manner, Chri&s;t's righteou&s;ne&s;s is upon all his &s;eed, by his <HI>&s;ingle act,</HI> before they had any capacity of obeying, after the &s;imilitude of his obedi|ence, or of a&s;&s;enting to what he did, or &s;uffered: This mani|fe&s;ts &s;uch an union to him, &s;uch an inclu&s;ion of the whole &s;eed in him, as renders his condition theirs, in every &s;tate which he pa&s;&s;es through&mdash;<HI>For as in Adam all die, even &s;o in Chri&s;t &s;hall all be made alive.</HI></Q>
P. 14.</P>
<P>The words of the text contradict the po&s;ition he would prove by it. For it &s;peaks of our concern in Adam's &s;in as a <HI>pa&s;t event,</HI> but of life by Chri&s;t as what <HI>&s;hall be</HI> hereafter. And in Rom. v. 12&mdash;20, while the &s;acred writer declares a likene&s;s be|tween our two public heads in &s;ome things, he repeatedly a&s;&s;erts an unlikene&s;s in others. What they each did as public heads, belongs to all their &s;eed; but as to what they did, and the way how it comes to their &s;eed, there is an infinite di&s;parity betwixt them. By <HI>one offence</HI> Adam brought us all into a &s;tate of revolt from God, &s;o that as we come into the world we all love the creature more than the Creator, love &s;elf above him, till we are born again, and death comes upon us by <HI>law</HI> as a ju&s;t <HI>debt</HI>; but <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> and abundance of <HI>grace</HI> are <HI>received</HI> as a <HI>free gift.</HI> As &s;oon as Adam fell, he cea&s;ed to be our covenant head, &s;o that we are not an&s;werable for any of his after &s;ins, any more than for the &s;ins of other men that we allow of; but Chri&s;t is the unchangeable &s;urety of all his cho&s;en, and is able to &s;ave them to the uttermo&s;t. From a &s;tate of union and communion with God, and lord&s;hip over the earth, Adam by <HI>one act</HI> ru&s;hed into rebellion and mi&s;ery; but by freely a&s;&s;uming our nature, and taking our law-place, Je&s;us &s;aves from the dreadful guilt and power of <HI>many offences.</HI> By one act a fire might be kindled, enough to lay a city in ruins, and a little infection might &s;pread the plague through a kingdom; but how great mu&s;t the work be to &s;top the conflagration or contagion, and to re&s;tore health and pro&s;perity again? Therefore it is &s;trictly true, that <HI>where &s;in abounded, grace</HI> DID MUCH MORE <HI>abound.</HI> The word <HI>as,</HI> in 1 Cor. xv. 22, plainly points to the two heads, and the influ|ence that proceeds therefrom. <HI>As</HI> by Adam's &s;in a corrupt na|ture is communicated to his po&s;terity, which cau&s;es the di&s;&s;olu|tion of our bodies; <HI>even</HI> &s;o is the gift of righteou&s;ne&s;s, a new nature, and the re&s;urrection of the body, communicated by Chri&s;t to his &s;eed. <HI>For &s;ince by man came death, by man came al&s;o the re&s;urrection of the dead.</HI> And let it never be forgotten, that death comes upon all as our <HI>ju&s;t wages</HI>; but eternal life as
<PB N="10" REF="017464_0010_0FA1216E6F284400">
a <HI>free gift.</HI> Rom. vi. 23. No two ideas are more di&s;tinct, nor more ea&s;ily under&s;tood by common people. All the ble&s;&s;ings of &s;alvation were provided by covenant in Chri&s;t, before the world began; but the only way for any to enjoy them, is by receiving them freely by faith.</P>
<P>Upon this Relly &s;ays,
<Q>believe and thou &s;halt be &s;aved, is certainly &s;imilar unto, <HI>do this and live</HI>; man, in him&s;elf, being as capable of doing the one as the other.</Q>
P. 42. I am &s;en&s;ible that many would have it &s;o; but they can never accompli&s;h their de&s;ire, till they can make wages and a free gift to be the &s;ame thing; nor till partaking freely of a rich fea&s;t, can be the &s;ame as working hard to earn it. Neither can the plea of inability excu&s;e tho&s;e who <HI>make light</HI> of the go&s;pel call, till their natural faculties of hearing, &s;eeing and ta&s;ting, are gone, in&s;tead of being fixed upon objects oppo&s;ite to what they &s;hould be. Mat. xiii. 15, and xxii. 1&mdash;12. Luke xiv. 16&mdash;24. Natural inability often excu&s;es from blame; but moral inability is the very &s;oul of iniquity. The cau&s;e why we cannot love God &s;upremely, is becau&s;e we love the creature above him, which is the e&s;&s;ence of idolatry; and the rea&s;on why we cannot believe his truth, is becau&s;e it reproves our evil deeds, the works of darkne&s;s, which we <HI>love rather than light.</HI> Hence moral impotency to love God, and to believe the record he has given of his Son, is <HI>the condemnation</HI> which all unbelievers are under; and his <HI>wrath abideth on them</HI>; from which nothing but a <HI>receiving his te&s;timony,</HI> and <HI>&s;etting to their &s;eal that he is true,</HI> can deliver any &s;oul. John iii. 18&mdash;21, 34&mdash;36. Our per&s;onal intere&s;t is not the direct object of faith, but the con&s;equence and privilege which is received by believ|ing, as looking is the way of enjoying the light, and looking to the object that Mo&s;es &s;et up by divine direction, was the way whereby the poi&s;on of the fiery &s;erpents was expelled. If any who were bitten refu&s;ed to look to that object, the poi&s;on killed them, while the nature and efficacy of the remedy was as good to tho&s;e who looked, as if none had refu&s;ed it.</P>
<P>Material bodies are dark things, and are often made u&s;e of to &s;hut out the light, by &s;uch as hate it, and love darkne&s;s rather than light. And is not this the labour of the writer I am an|&s;wering? The head, &s;ays he, was never without the body in the Lord; as if the creature was co-exi&s;tent with the Son of God! David &s;ays, <HI>Thine eyes did &s;ee my &s;ub&s;tance, yet being</HI> IMPER|FECT, <HI>and in thy book all my members were written, which in continuance</HI> WERE <HI>fa&s;hioned, when as yet there was</HI> NONE OF THEM.

<Q>unto the right under&s;tanding of the &s;criptures, it is nece&s;&s;ary to know, that they con&s;i&s;t of two parts, <HI>letter</HI> and <HI>&s;pirit,</HI> or <HI>law</HI> and <HI>go&s;pel.</HI></Q>

And thus di&s;tingui&s;hing them in the &s;criptures, we appeal from the law unto the go&s;pel; our authority for &s;o doing is founded on what follows; what&s;oever the law &s;aith, it &s;aith unto them that are under it: But Je&s;us was made of a woman, made under the law, therefore the law &s;peaks to him, and commands him to perfect obedience. But, the law can only cur&s;e the &s;inner: God &s;ent his Son in the likene&s;s of &s;inful fle&s;h, he was made &s;in for us, Chri&s;t hath delivered us from the cur&s;e of the law, being made a cur&s;e for us: The equity of which proceeding, appears from the union &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ing between Chri&s;t and the church, of which I have &s;uffi|ciently &s;poken. Nor dare we read any one threatening in the &s;criptures, again&s;t the &s;inner and ungodly, <HI>unto our&s;elves,</HI> out of him, becau&s;e we <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heb. xii. 20.</NOTE> <HI>cannot endure it.</HI></Q>
P. 40. And &s;peaking of the &s;word of the &s;pirit, he &s;ays,
<Q>Je&s;us, &s;heathing it in his own heart's blood, the divine glutinating power thereof hath rendered it impo&s;&s;ible to draw it again to ano|ther execution: God is ju&s;t and true, and will not; men or devils cannot.</Q>

P. 48.</P>
<P>This is the object of his wor&s;hip, the faith he has eagerly embraced; but the difference between his god and the God of I&s;rael, is very great. For the God of I&s;rael connected his pre|cepts and promi&s;es together, and called it <HI>pre&s;umption,</HI> and <HI>tempting</HI> of him, to expect the latter without regarding the for|mer. And when the <HI>god of this world</HI> came to <HI>tempt</HI> our Saviour, he made ju&s;t &s;uch a di&s;tinction in the &s;criptures as this writer does; but he had <HI>nothing in Je&s;us</HI> that could <HI>reconcile</HI> him to &s;uch an object of wor&s;hip.

P. 4. If &s;o, then Chri&s;t could not have <HI>&s;uffered for &s;ins, the ju&s;t for the unju&s;t, that he might bring us to God.</HI> 1 Pet. iii. 18. Therefore, 2, the faith of the go&s;pel moves the believer to take all the &s;hame to him|&s;elf, and ever to give all the glory of his &s;alvation to God, in practice as well as pretence. But while Relly pretends to do &s;o, he in reality would have people <HI>crucify to them&s;elves the Son of God afre&s;h, and put him to an open &s;hame.</HI> For if ju&s;tice can|not puni&s;h the innocent, he would have people treat Je&s;us as a guilty per&s;on from day to day, &s;ince he teaches them, as I have proved, to turn all the precepts, threatenings and cur&s;es of &s;cripture upon him. And, under pretence of a&s;cribing great honor to Je&s;us, Relly mentions Noah, Lot, Abraham, Sarah, Mo&s;es, David, Solomon, and Job, who are honorably &s;poken of in &s;cripture, while &s;till their imperfections are expo&s;ed; and &s;ays thereon,
<Q>tho&s;e men were all types of Je&s;us, their cha|racters figurative of his.</Q>
P. 53. But le&s;t he &s;hould be ac|cu&s;ed from hence of making their virtues no more than figures, he &s;ays,
<Q>tho&s;e per&s;ons were really what the &s;criptures &s;ay they were, that is, righteous, faithful, meek, holy, wi&s;e, patient, &amp;c. without any exception; they were &s;o in Chri&s;t.</Q>
P. 54. That is, as they were imperfect, they were types of Chri&s;t; but at the &s;ame time they were really perfect in him! I challenge all Relly's admirers to make any better &s;en&s;e of his words than this if they can; which is &s;o oppo&s;ite to the truth that no prie&s;t in I&s;rael, who had any blemi&s;h in his birth or per|&s;on,

Luke xii. 42. But Relly, through his whole treati&s;e, takes pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture which are peculiar to the &s;aints, or the church of God which he hath cho&s;en out of the world, and applies them to all the human race without di&s;tinction; and his main &s;trength lies in this <HI>confu&s;ion,</HI> together with an appearance of oppo&s;ing many dangerous errors. And &s;ays he,
<Q>where people are taught to di&s;tingui&s;h between &s;aints and &s;inners, and to think them&s;elves holier than their neighbours, it is not &s;trange that they u&s;e them ill.&mdash;And to talk of <HI>practice,</HI> without keeping the <HI>whole law,</HI> is &s;uch a deception, where &s;cripture authority is admitted, yea or even what rea&s;on &s;ugge&s;ts of the nature of the divine Being, as cannot be accounted for, but by the pride, bewitchery and madne&s;s, which we are naturally involved in.</Q>
<HI>Pre|face,</HI> p. 13.</P>
<P>But one &s;hort que&s;tion may turn the&s;e characters back upon him who ca&s;t them out; which is this; are &s;ouls reconciled to God as his &s;ubjects, or not? While he remains the Sovereign of the Univer&s;e, no rational &s;oul can ever think, &s;peak, or act con|trary to his holy law, without contracting guilt to it&s;elf; which can only be removed by the atonement of Chri&s;t, applied by the Holy Spirit; who calls us daily to pray, <HI>forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.</HI> But Relly &s;ays,
<Q>we claim no good out of him, nor <HI>will</HI> we acknowledge the evil, fora&s;much as in him we <HI>have been purged.</HI></Q>
P. 53. This may well remind us of them who <HI>&s;peak evil of the things which they know not; but what they know naturally as brute bea&s;ts; in tho&s;e things they cor|rupt them&s;elves.</HI> Jude 10. Oxen know their owners, and not only come daily to their ma&s;ters for food, but al&s;o do them great &s;ervice; and &s;ome will come many rods at a call or mo|tion, and put their necks under the yoke. A loud reproof to our di&s;obedient &s;ouls. I&s;ai. i. 3, 4. Jer. xxxi. 18&mdash;20. The la&s;t of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages plainly opens the way of <HI>repentance,</HI> and how mercy is received and enjoyed. Again it is &s;aid, <HI>he that believeth not God, hath made him a liar, becau&s;e he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son. And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life; and this life is in his Son.</HI> 1 John v. 10, 11.
<Q>From whence it is plain (&s;ays Relly) that he who believeth not, hath eternal life given him in the Son of
<PB N="19" REF="017464_0019_0FA124632DF2D910">
God, as fully as him who believeth; el&s;e it doth not appear how he could make God a liar, by not believing; nor how the unbeliever can be <HI>cen&s;ured</HI> for not believing what was not true.</Q>
P. 67. His whole &s;cheme turns upon this point; therefore let the following things be carefully ob&s;erved. 1. That all our righteou&s;ne&s;s and &s;trength is <HI>in the Son; and he that hath the Son, hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God, hath not life.</HI> 2. He who hath it, <HI>receives it</HI> by faith as a <HI>free gift.</HI> 3. <HI>There are three that bear witne&s;s in earth, the &s;pirit, the water, and the blood:&mdash;And he that believeth on the Son of God, hath the witne&s;s</HI> IN HIMSELF. 1 John v. 8&mdash;12. Where then is the proof that Relly would draw from hence? Is not he a liar, in a&s;&s;erting that eternal life is <HI>as fully</HI> given to the unbe|liever, as to the believer! Sin is the wor&s;t of poi&s;on, and can only be expelled by looking to the antetype of the brazen &s;er|pent; and it is the &s;pirit only that enables any to look thereto; and no other water could remove filth, or blood remove guilt, like the <HI>change</HI> which is now wrought in the believer. 2 Cor. iii. 14&mdash;18. And <HI>the &s;pirit it&s;elf beareth witne&s;s with our &s;pirit that we are the children of God.</HI> But how came any to be &s;o? An&s;wer, <HI>ye were the &s;ervants of &s;in; but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.</HI> Rom. vi. 17, and viii. 16. Such are the only per&s;ons that Paul &s;peaks to when he &s;ays, <HI>reckon ye your&s;elves to be dead indeed unto &s;in.</HI> Rom. vi. 11. Which words Relly applies to &s;uch as have a full con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the "life and love of &s;in" in them&s;elves, p. 49, while he declares tho&s;e to be the di&s;ciples of the fal&s;e Chri&s;t, who &s;ay,
<Q>I am converted, I believe, I bear the fruits of the &s;pirit, I have the marks of grace in me.</Q>
P. 56. That many &s;peak &s;o, who have not the truth in them, is readily granted; and al&s;o that great mode&s;ty and caution are called for in &s;uch affairs. Yet God him&s;elf warns men again&s;t glory|ing in their wi&s;dom, might, or riches; and requires his chil|dren to <HI>glory in this, that they under&s;tand and know him.</HI> Jer. ix. 23, 24. 1 Cor. i. 31.</P>
<P>Relly would be thought to be exceeding evangelical, and for that end he expo&s;es many dark legal things in others; and yet he was &s;o oppo&s;ite to the go&s;pel way of &s;alvation, as to declare that God could not love any, but &s;uch as

<HEAD>An An&s;wer to Mr. Winche&s;ter.</HEAD>
<P>In March, 1781, we were &s;urprized with a report, that Mr. Elhanan Winche&s;ter, who went from hence the autumn pre|ceding, had fallen in with Murray's doctrine. This report he contradicted in letters to &s;ome of his friends, which held many in &s;u&s;pen&s;e about the matter, till he publi&s;hed a pamphlet upon it at Philadelphia in September. I &s;oon had a glance of it, but no opportunity deliberately to peru&s;e it till February, after which was the fir&s;t &s;ight I had of Relly's treati&s;e. By compar|ing them together, an e&s;&s;ential difference appears betwixt them, though tending to much the &s;ame end; for Relly builds upon an imaginary union with Je&s;us, but Winche&s;ter upon the bene|volent nature of the Deity. Relly declares &s;in to be an infinite evil, de&s;erving of infinite puni&s;hment; but Winche&s;ter treats it as a natural, and not a moral evil; as a calamity rather than a crime. Relly holds that &s;alvation is already compleat in Chri&s;t, &s;o as to exempt men from all future puni&s;hment; but Winche&s;|ter denies the need of Chri&s;t's blood to appea&s;e any wrath in the Deity, and holds it as a medicine to purge away di&s;orders in nature, which are &s;o great as to require the &s;ufferings of many ages before all will be removed. Relly rather takes it for grant|ed that all men are in Chri&s;t, than attempting any fair proof of it; but Winche&s;ter &s;tates plain arguments upon it, and an&s;wers objections. Relly's &s;cheme did not permit him to &s;peak of &s;al|vation for devils; but Winche&s;ter's points thereto. Relly glo|ries in his performance as a new di&s;covery, of which he had not &s;een the like; but Winche&s;ter makes no &s;uch pretence, it being a collection out of my&s;tic writers; and indeed it is in nature the

&s;ame with the <HI>philo&s;ophy and vain deceit</HI> of the &s;econd and third centuries, which brought on the antichri&s;tian apo&s;tacy.</P>
<P>Origen, in the third century, went a &s;tep further therein than any in our land have yet done, as I have heard of.
<Q>En|chanted by the charms of the Platonic philo&s;ophy, he &s;et it up as the te&s;t of all religion.</Q>
Said he,
<Q>the &s;ource of many evils lies in adhering to the carnal or <HI>external</HI> part of &s;cripture. Tho&s;e who do &s;o, &s;hall not attain to the kingdom of God. Let us, therefore, &s;eek after the <HI>&s;pirit</HI> and &s;ub|&s;tantial fruit of the word, which are <HI>hidden and my&s;terious.</HI> The &s;criptures are of little u&s;e to tho&s;e who under&s;tand them as they are <HI>written.</HI></Q>
One of the errors that this carried him into was to &s;ay,
<Q>that the torments of the damned will have an end; and that as Chri&s;t has been crucified in this world to &s;ave mankind, he is to be crucified in the next to &s;ave the devils<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mo&s;heim's Eccl. Hi&s;t. vol. <HI>1.</HI> p. <HI>219, 223, 476.</HI> Dublin edition.</NOTE>.</Q>
From this &s;ource came the doctrine of monke|ry, purgatory, prayers for the dead, and all the re&s;t of the corruptions and tyrannies of Rome. Well therefore did the apo&s;tle &s;ay, to the cha&s;te &s;pou&s;e of Chri&s;t, <HI>I fear le&s;t by any means, as the &s;erpent beguiled Eve through his &s;ubtilty, &s;o your minds &s;hould be corrupted from the &s;implicity that is in Chri&s;t.</HI> 2 Cor. xi. 3. To admit of a <HI>duplicity</HI> of meanings in his word, which cannot be learned from what is <HI>written,</HI> by comparing one place with another, <HI>&s;piritual things with &s;piritual,</HI> rai&s;es &s;uch <HI>mi&s;ts</HI> and <HI>clouds</HI> in the minds of men, as intercept between them and the light of truth. And when any are re&s;olved to proceed in that way, di&s;putes with them are as vain as it would be to di&s;pute with <HI>clouds carried about of winds,</HI> or with <HI>raging waves of the &s;ea, foaming out their own &s;hame.</HI> 1 Cor. ii. 13, 14. Jude 12, 13. It is al&s;o forbidden, becau&s;e it <HI>genders &s;trifes; and the &s;ervant of the Lord mu&s;t not &s;trive, but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient, in meekne&s;s in&s;tructing tho&s;e that oppo&s;e them&s;elves,</HI> &amp;c. 2 Tim. ii. 23&mdash;26. No won|der then that an in&s;pired apo&s;tle cried, <HI>who is &s;ufficient for the&s;e things!</HI> May all our eyes be to heaven for direction, while we attempt &s;omething of this nature.</P>
<P><HI>Ye &s;hall not &s;urely die,</HI> &s;aid the &s;erpent to our mother Eve: Which the Bapti&s;t church in Philadelphia publi&s;hed as an ob|jection again&s;t Mr. Winche&s;ter's &s;cheme, four months before his pamphlet came out.

P. 54. This is a proper key, to open the nature of the my&s;tic &s;cheme.

And for men to a&s;&s;ume &s;uch a power one over another, is very odious and pernicious; and why? becau&s;e darkne&s;s and corruption prevail mo&s;t terribly in fallen nature. Fury, wrath and anger, make mo&s;t horrid work in the world; and the ruling powers of the earth have often acted more like bea&s;ts than men, for the&s;e fifteen hundred years;

yea, like the wor&s;t &s;ort of bea&s;ts; leopards, bears, and lions. Rev. xiii. 2. And who can think of attributing any thing of like nature unto God! Our feeble minds &s;hrink away, and would rather believe almo&s;t any thing el&s;e, than to entertain &s;uch thoughts within us. How can a Being of infinite goodne&s;s and love make any creature, who &s;hall be mi&s;erable without end? How can any, who receive great favours from the mediation and merits of Chri&s;t, be eternally lo&s;t? And how can it be ju&s;t with God to damn men forever for not believing his go&s;pel, when Adam in innocency could have no idea of atonement for the guilty, or clean&s;ing for the filthy? Rather than an&s;wer either of the&s;e que&s;tions in the affirmative, men will rack their invention, and &s;train their thinking powers to &s;uch a degree, that, like our &s;training our &s;ight by looking upon the &s;un, we cannot &s;ee the plaine&s;t objects. This is often the ca&s;e with my&s;tic writers, and is very con&s;picuous in Mr. Winche&s;ter. And, while he has broken him&s;elf again&s;t the rock mo&s;t terribly, many &s;erious per&s;ons feel a trembling about the matter, not knowing what will be the con&s;equence.</P>
<P>Having read his text, which is Gen. iii. 15, he &s;ays,
<Q>the&s;e words contain the fir&s;t opening of the glorious go&s;pel day to poor lo&s;t man.&mdash;In order to have proper ideas of the glorious Deity, we mu&s;t con&s;ider him as a Being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of infinite wi&s;dom, power, and goodne&s;s.</Q>
But immediately goes on to deny that fury, wrath, or anger, could ever dwell in him; for, &s;ays he,
<Q>wherever fury is found, &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, envy and pride; are joined therewith: The&s;e are the four elements of hell, or fallen nature, and mutually generate each other.</Q>
P. 3. All this is in one page, at his beginning. But as we mu&s;t look cautiou&s;ly towards the &s;un, if we would enjoy its light and benefits, in&s;tead of being &s;o ha&s;ty in determining what is not in God, let us look a little into our&s;elves. Is it po&s;&s;ible for a man to love his wife, children or friends, with|out hating the wretch that would murder them? And is it po&s;&s;ible for any &s;oul to love truth and goodne&s;s, without hating deceit and cruelty? And are not love and hatred acts of will? And when we are enabled to accompli&s;h any work we engage in, are we not plea&s;ed with it? Yea, and if the work be right, is it not right to be plea&s;ed with it? And, if wicked wretches oppo&s;e what is right, is it not right to hate &s;uch oppo&s;ition? How then could a man read tho&s;e words of God, <HI>I will put en|mity,</HI> and then go on and a&s;&s;ert four times over in his &s;ermon, that there was nothing arbitrary, that is, nothing of <HI>will or plea&s;ure</HI> in the whole affair! Adam's trial was not arbitrary, the threatening was not arbitrary, the remedy was not arbitrary,
<PB N="26" REF="017464_0026_0FA1246933EA19A0">
and puni&s;hment upon &s;inners is not arbitrary! Immediately after the la&s;t of the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions, he &s;ays,
<Q>Oh, would they con&s;ider that the &s;cripture never repre&s;ents the atonement of Chri&s;t, as intended to quench or put out a wrath that was ri&s;en in the Deity; but to break the power of death in us, and to overcome the wrath of fallen nature; to rai&s;e a new life in our &s;ouls, and to bring both fallen nature and creatures back into their fir&s;t &s;tate of purity and perfection.</Q>
To confirm which he &s;ays,
<Q>it was evident when our Saviour died, that his blood had a phy&s;ical power over nature, by the effects it produced, in cau&s;ing the earth to &s;hake, the rocks to rend, and the graves to open.</Q>
P. 16. Before this he had mentioned our Saviour's warning again&s;t deceivers, who cried, lo, here, or lo, there. Luke xvii. 20, 21. Upon which Winche&s;ter &s;ays,
<Q>here Chri&s;t him&s;elf called the Pha|ri&s;ees to behold, that the kingdom of God was <HI>within them</HI>; and if within tho&s;e, who are el&s;ewhere called &s;erpents and vipers, and threatened with the damnation of hell, then cer|tainly in all mankind. This divine &s;eed is the only begin|ning and po&s;&s;ibility of a new life; and unle&s;s the means of grace can reach that hidden &s;park, they can do us no good. And it is al&s;o certain, that unle&s;s there was a &s;eed hidden in our &s;ouls, capable of being rai&s;ed up by the power and at|traction of Chri&s;t, nothing from without could take any effect upon us, or rai&s;e up the <HI>divine life in us,</HI> any more than the &s;un, air and water, of this world, could cau&s;e a flint to vegetate like a corn of wheat, or any other &s;eed.</Q>
P. 8, 9. He is &s;o far from denying that God has a will, that he &s;ays he
<Q>continually manife&s;ts a will of infinite goodne&s;s towards all his creatures, according to their various circum|&s;tances; &s;eeking their recovery and compleat re&s;toration.</Q>
P. 3. Without which he &s;ays,
<Q>the good news which Chri&s;t commanded to be preached to every creature is mockery, in&s;ult, and in&s;incerity.</Q>
P. 17.</P>
<P>Here is a lively &s;pecimen of my&s;tic philo&s;ophy, and my&s;tic di|vinity. And it has two things in it, that are very charming to many. One is, that it is calculated to guard again&s;t thinking that either God or man act with bad de&s;igns towards each other. The other is, that it rai&s;es a hope that they will all be reconciled, and come into perfect agreement and happine&s;s at la&s;t; notwith|&s;tanding very bad things have <HI>inevitably</HI> interrupted their peace, and made dreadful works between them, which are not likely to be all removed for many ages to come. If &s;o great a good can be obtained, who would not exert all his powers to promote it, and to guard again&s;t things that contradict it, and would ob|&s;truct

it? As I take it, the&s;e are the principal cau&s;es for the prevalence of that &s;y&s;tem in the world, for &s;o long a time, and to &s;o great a degree; and al&s;o why tho&s;e who appear again&s;t it are called noi&s;y curs, and by many other hard names. But when men have done their be&s;t, and done their wor&s;t, one great difficulty has &s;till lain in their way, which they never could re|move, and it is not likely that they ever will. And that is, that God has &s;aid, <HI>I will put enmity between the two &s;eeds</HI>; and there it remains, in &s;uch a fixed manner, that the labours of near &s;ix thou&s;and years have not removed it, nor brought the two parties a whit nearer together than they were when the war began. Neither is it within my power to believe, that the enmity will ever be removed to eternity. And I think that Paul was of the &s;ame mind. Rom. ix. 13&mdash;23. And it ap|pears that the &s;ame objections were then made again&s;t his doc|trine, as are often made in this day; which all centre to this point, <HI>why doth he yet find fault? for who hath ever re&s;i&s;ted his will?</HI> If he doth his will and plea&s;ure through the univer&s;e, and is not obliged to give us any better rea&s;on therefor than be|cau&s;e <HI>&s;o it &s;eemed good in his &s;ight,</HI> Mat. xi. 26, then why does he find fault with any for acting as they plea&s;e? Since the&s;e things have perplexed the greate&s;t minds, and puzzled the greate&s;t capacities upon earth, it certainly becomes &s;o poor a creature as the writer is to proceed with great reverence and caution.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place I take notice, that the arguments upon this &s;ublime &s;ubject are generally from the le&s;s <HI>again&s;t</HI> the greater; but that there have been a few in every age, who have argued from the le&s;s <HI>to</HI> the greater; and the latter appears the prefera|ble way to me, e&s;pecially when I &s;ee what approbation my Saviour gave to it. When he was per&s;onally upon earth, a Roman captain had a &s;ervant that was dear to him, who was taken &s;ick; therefore the captain &s;ent to Je&s;us for his help, which he was ready to grant; upon information whereof the captain &s;ent again, &s;aying, <HI>Lord, trouble not thy&s;elf, for I am not worthy that thou &s;houlde&s;t enter under my roof. Wherefore nei|ther thought I my&s;elf worthy to came unto thee: But &s;ay in a word, and my &s;ervant &s;hall be healed. For I al&s;o am a man &s;et under authority, having under me &s;oldiers, and I &s;ay unto one, go, and he goeth; and to another, come, and he cometh; and to my &s;ervant, do this, and he doth it.</HI> Luke vii. 6&mdash;8. Now it appears to me that the captain, like other rational men, received the thinking rea&s;oning faculty in a natural way; but I am per&s;uaded that he had not &s;o much as the <HI>&s;eed</HI> of <HI>this</HI> way of rea&s;oning, till it was <HI>given him from above.</HI> And the foregoing treati&s;e of Mr. Relly
<PB N="28" REF="017464_0028_0FA1246AB19DA518">
confirms this &s;entiment; &s;ince, as has been ob&s;erved, after all his high notions of union, he denies the po&s;&s;ibility of God's loving any but &s;uch as he &s;aw <HI>worthy</HI> of it. If &s;o, the Roman captain could not have been highly commended by Je&s;us, for twice over denying that him&s;elf was <HI>worthy</HI> of God's free fa|vours. And I remember that a per&s;on of good credit in old times &s;aid, <HI>O Lord, I know that the way of man is not</HI> IN HIM|SELF. Jer. x. 23. And that another, by good authority, called the &s;inner to <HI>for&s;ake his way and thoughts,</HI> and to <HI>turn to</HI> HIM, who&s;e <HI>thoughts</HI> and <HI>ways</HI> are as <HI>high above ours,</HI> as the heavens are above the earth. I&s;ai. lv. 7&mdash;9. And, if I mi&s;take not, the very nature of faith carries us off from &s;elf, to the truth of another; from tru&s;ting in an arm of fle&s;h, to tru&s;t wholly in the Lord. And per&s;ons of a contrary character <HI>&s;ee not when good cometh.</HI> Jer. xvii. 5, 6.</P>
<P>This was the ca&s;e with the Phari&s;ees. Though they were at the head of the only church of God then in the world, yet they were ready to li&s;ten to the lo, here, or lo, there, of deceivers, at the time when the promi&s;ed Me&s;&s;iah was <HI>within them</HI>; or in the <HI>mid&s;t of them,</HI> as others render the words. He was then within that church, perfectly obeying all the laws which God had given to it, and fulfilling the prophecies concerning him. By his <HI>kingly power</HI> he daily cau&s;ed the blind to &s;ee, the lame to walk, lepers to become clean, the deaf to hear, the dead to live, and the poor to have the go&s;pel preached to them. All which gave <HI>offence</HI> to tho&s;e who imagined that they had an <HI>inhe|rent power</HI> to walk to the temple, to clean&s;e them&s;elves, to hear and live. Mat. xi. 3&mdash;19. If the &s;eed &s;poken of in the fir&s;t promi&s;e of &s;alvation, meant any intellectual power in every man, no rea&s;on can be given for its being called the <HI>&s;eed of the woman,</HI> the weaker ve&s;&s;el. But when we &s;ee Je&s;us, who was born of a virgin, without the knowledge of man, the words appear full of important meaning. To prepare his way in I&s;rael, <HI>all fle&s;h was cried down as fading-gra&s;s</HI>; yea, as <HI>le&s;s than nothing, and vanity,</HI> before him. And Peter a&s;&s;ures us, that &s;ouls are <HI>born again of this &s;eed.</HI> I&s;ai. xl. 6&mdash;17. 1 Pet. i. 23&mdash;25.

<P N="1">1. How can it be, that a God of infinite love &s;hould give exi&s;tence to any creatures who &s;hall be mi&s;erable without end? If any a&s;k this que&s;tion without due fear and reverence, let them turn and con&s;ider how they can an&s;wer God's que&s;tions to them. I&s;ai. xl. 12&mdash;28. Rom. ix. 20&mdash;23. The command is, <HI>let all things be done decently and in order</HI>; but this word has often been perverted, to promote the greate&s;t di&s;orders upon earth. Gla&s;s is the be&s;t medium we have to let light into our dwellings, and fire will penetrate into rocks, and break them to pieces. Therefore the&s;e metaphors are made u&s;e of to repre|&s;ent the excellency of the word of God. 2 Cor. iii. 18, and iv. 2&mdash;4. Jer. xxiii. 29. When the earth intercepts between us and the &s;un, it is dark in our windows, as well as el&s;e|where. And &s;uch is the effect, when human inventions, or any earthly object, gets between our &s;ouls and the Son of righteou&s;ne&s;s. The number of the bea&s;t is the <HI>number of a man</HI>; and John &s;aw <HI>as it were</HI> a &s;ea of gla&s;s mingled with fire; and tho&s;e who had gotten a compleat victory over that number &s;tand|ing thereon, <HI>having the harps of God.</HI> And they &s;ing the &s;ong of Mo&s;es, lawgiver to I&s;rael, and the &s;ong of the Lamb, who is our lawgiver, judge, and king. Rev. xiii. 18, and xv. 2, 3. I&s;ai. xxxiii. 22. <HI>As it were,</HI> plainly &s;hews that the words are to be taken in a figurative &s;en&s;e; but the my&s;tics take them <HI>literally,</HI> for the <HI>matter</HI> that angels and men were made out of&punc; This <HI>confounding</HI> of matter and mind together, is no little part of <HI>my&s;tery Babylon.</HI> Though a &s;till more horrid part is, their <HI>confounding</HI> of creatures with their Creator! Fire, light, and animal &s;pirits, are all objects of &s;en&s;e: Yet the my&s;tics a&s;&s;ert, that they are <HI>images</HI> of the Triune God. P. 4.

the mid&s;t of the fire; take heed therefore le&s;t ye corrupt your&s;elves.</HI> Deut. iv. 15, 16. Yet men, even to this day, are bewitched with &s;uch corruptions. The conceit that <HI>divine wi&s;dom</HI> was Adam's fir&s;t wife, and that meats and a woman were afterwards given him to &s;atisfy his <HI>lu&s;ts,</HI> and to prevent wor&s;e evils, car|ried many gloomy heads, in ea&s;tern climes, away from human &s;ociety, and the duties thereof, into &s;olitary places, in &s;earch after that wi&s;dom. By degrees this was improved into nun|neries, celibacy of the clergy, and their arbitrary prohibition of meats&mdash;Canons which were often di&s;pen&s;ed with for mo|ney; and meats and women were allowed of, to prevent wor&s;e evils. Thus <HI>many departed from the faith, giving heed to &s;educing &s;pirits, and doctrines of devils; &s;peaking lies in hypocri&s;y, having their con&s;cience feared with a hot iron: Forbidding to marry, and commanding to ab&s;tain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thank&s;giving of them who believe and know the truth.</HI> 1 Tim. iv. 1&mdash;3.</P>
<P>A &s;pirit can think, &s;peak and act; and the actions or works of God are evidently intended by his <HI>back parts,</HI> which are plainly &s;een by believers, though no man can <HI>&s;ee his face and live.</HI> Exod. xxxiii. 20&mdash;23. When a creature's thoughts, words and actions, exactly agree together, he exhibits the brighte&s;t image of God that we know of; but to talk one thing, while they think and act the rever&s;e, is preci&s;ely the image of the devil. A notable in&s;tance hereof appears in a company from Europe, with a woman at their head, who began openly two years ago to propagate the above <HI>doctrine of devils</HI> in the county of Albany, with great <HI>power, &s;igns, and lying wonders.</HI> 2 The&s;&s;. ii. 7&mdash;12. They prevailed &s;o far thereby la&s;t &s;ummer, as to make their head-quarters at Harvard, in Worce&s;ter county, at a hou&s;e where Shadrach Ireland had been at the head of a like delu&s;ion for many years before. The doctrine, both of Balaam and Jezebel, was to draw people into &s;en|&s;uality, and wor&s;hip objects of &s;en&s;e. <HI>To &s;educe my &s;ervants,</HI> &s;ays Je&s;us, <HI>to commit fornication, and to eat things &s;acrificed unto idols.</HI> Rev. ii. 14&mdash;20. The rea&s;on why God has &s;o exactly de&s;cribed the&s;e, and all other events, in his word, even from the beginning of time, is this, &s;ays he, <HI>becau&s;e I knew thee that thou wa&s;t ob&s;tinate, and thy neck an iron &s;inew, and thy brow bra&s;s.

And it is a mean piece of di&s;hone&s;ty for any to &s;teal a finer dre&s;s than this for human wi&s;dom, from the divine oracles, and then to u&s;e the &s;ame again&s;t the infallible in&s;piration of the book they took it from. The&s;e things being premi&s;ed, I come to offer a direct an&s;wer to the above que&s;tion.</P>
<P>As the powers of thinking and choice are e&s;&s;ential to all im|mortal &s;pirits, they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily de&s;ire the knowledge and enjoyment of the be&s;t good; and as all finite knowledge is bound|ed by certain limits, they would ever be liable to err, if they had not &s;ome &s;ufficient guard again&s;t it. And the be&s;t guard which we can conceive of, is to have the infinite excellency of all God's perfections di&s;played before us in the cleare&s;t light, &s;o as fully to demon&s;trate, that every de&s;irable good is to be en|joyed in the way of obedience; and that di&s;obedience to him is infinitely hateful and dreadful. The more deeply the&s;e ideas are fixed, and the &s;tronger the per&s;ua&s;ion is that he cannot err. and that all his requirements are holy, ju&s;t and good, the more earne&s;t will be the de&s;ire to know and do his will continually. Mutual e&s;teem and confidence con&s;titute the &s;trength and happi|ne&s;s of any community. Delu&s;ion has often done much this way; but what di&s;cord and re&s;entment has en&s;ued, when the deceit has been detected! Who then can tell how &s;trong the bond of peace is, where a full a&s;&s;urance is granted of eternal &s;ecurity again&s;t any &s;uch thing! As I take it, all the &s;acred volume, and every event that has ever happened in the univer&s;e, have been ordered &s;o by infinite wi&s;dom, as forever to fix the&s;e ideas in every believing mind, and the endle&s;s torments of the wicked an&s;wer the &s;ame end; and rea&s;on mo&s;t &s;urely teaches, that none could de&s;ire to break God's laws, or to neglect his grace, if they did not imagine to get &s;ome good, or to avoid &s;ome pre&s;ent evil, by &s;o doing.</P>
<P N="2">2. Since Adam in innocency could have no idea of atonement for the guilty, or clean&s;ing for the filthy, how can his fallen children be ju&s;tly damned for not believing the go&s;pel? An&s;wer, divine revelation was the only means whereby Adam knew that he ought not to eat of the forbidden tree; and nothing is more contrary to the law of &s;upreme love to God, than a di&s;belief of his te&s;timony. And in every nation where his go&s;pel has come, he has given &s;ufficient witne&s;&s;es of its verity; and if we receive the witne&s;s of men, the witne&s;s of God is infinitely greater. His witne&s;&s;es, it is true, have long prophe&s;ied in &s;ackcloth; that is, men and devils have ca&s;t a di&s;agreeable covering over them; but I tru&s;t the time is ha&s;tening, when it &s;hall be taken entirely off. Permit me therefore to make a little attempt towards &s;o

de&s;irable an end. Though many pretend that the doctrine of the Trinity is &s;uch as we can have no intelligible ideas of; yet believers know the contrary. For, take away the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of time, and the mode wherein earthly relations commence, which have no place in the Deity, and we may ea&s;ily conceive of a Father and Son perfectly equal in capacity and excellency, with &s;uch an onene&s;s in nature, and peculiarity of relation, as no others have; and al&s;o that they have their breath or &s;pirit by which they act. And when the Jews pretended that Je&s;us had but one witne&s;s, which is not a &s;ufficient proof in law, he an|&s;wered them, by appealing to the <HI>works</HI> done by him and his Father, which demon&s;trated his divine mi&s;&s;ion; and which were done for this end, <HI>that all men &s;hould honor the Son,</HI> EVEN <HI>as they honor the Father.</HI> John v. 17&mdash;37. Tho&s;e works were all effected by the Holy Spirit, which I take to be the rea&s;on why tho&s;e who, again&s;t light, with a de&s;piteful mind, a&s;cribed his <HI>good works</HI> to a <HI>bad cau&s;e,</HI> could never have forgivene&s;s, neither in this world nor in the world to come. Mat. xii. 24&mdash;32. Heb. x. 29, which, by the way, is a mo&s;t explicit te&s;timony again&s;t the conceit of univer&s;al &s;alvation.</P>
<P>Witne&s;&s;es are to prove points that are di&s;puted; and ever &s;ince the &s;erpent beguiled Eve, the greate&s;t conte&s;t has been upon the&s;e two points, viz. whether all that God &s;ays is <HI>true?</HI> or if true, how it can be <HI>equal?</HI> Now the cleare&s;t light which has ever been held up in this dark world about the&s;e matters, has been in and by the church of God, repre&s;ented in the old te&s;tament by one candle&s;tick, and in the new te&s;tament by two. The twelve patriarchs con&s;tituted the fir&s;t, and the twelve apo&s;tles the other; and both incorporated together &s;eem to be intended by the twenty-four elders; as the four bea&s;ts or living creatures mean their mini&s;ters in the four quarters of the earth. This united candle&s;tick &s;tands upon the holy writings; and the apo&s;tles appear to be put fir&s;t, becau&s;e they explain the pro|phets; which order appears both in the fir&s;t building of the Chri&s;tian church, and al&s;o in her triumph over my&s;tery Baby|lon. Ep. ii. 20. Rev. xviii. 20. The veil that Babylon has drawn over the nations, has been principally by darkening the truth with old te&s;tament figures, in&s;tead of explaining them by new te&s;tament light. That none can &s;ee Chri&s;ts kingdom without regeneration, and that no &s;triving about who &s;hall be greate&s;t can be allowed of therein, are two of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential articles in his kingdom. Every thing therefore of a contrary nature, which any have called religion, has been a veil and covering over the nations, to &s;hut out the light of truth. The Father's love is as free as water, and as beneficial too; and the

obedience and blood of the Son demon&s;trate that it flows to men in a way of perfect <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>equity</HI>; and it is the Holy Gho&s;t that di&s;covers and communicates the&s;e infinite ble&s;&s;ings; the&s;e I take to be intended by the three witne&s;&s;es in 1 John v. 8. And the works of the Father and the Son, wrought by the Holy Gho&s;t, I believe are intended by the two witne&s;&s;es, and the <HI>golden oil,</HI> which they empty into the church <HI>out of them&s;elves.</HI> For it is <HI>not by might, nor by power, but by</HI> MY SPIRIT, <HI>&s;aith the Lord of ho&s;ts.</HI> Zech. iv. 3&mdash;14. Rev. xi. 3&mdash;19. And every unbeliever <HI>&s;trives</HI> again&s;t, and <HI>re&s;i&s;ts</HI> this &s;pirit; for which therefore the finally impenitent will ju&s;tly be damned. Gen. vi. 3. Acts vii. 51. For, &s;ays God, <HI>they hold fa&s;t deceit, they refu&s;e to return. Through deceit they refu&s;e to know me.</HI> Jer. viii. 5, and ix. 6. They love darkne&s;s rather than light.

This is a text that Mr. Winche&s;ter lays &s;tre&s;s upon. P. 32. But let him remember that the &s;ame word is u&s;ed in the pro|phetic &s;ong of Mo&s;es, concerning &s;ome who did not e&s;cape divine <HI>vengeance,</HI> which Paul applies to &s;uch as &s;in <HI>wilfully</HI> and <HI>&s;pitefully,</HI> af|ter receiving the <HI>knowledge of the truth,</HI> &amp;c.

Jude 5. Indeed what good is there in this lower world which does not come by the mediation and merits of Chri&s;t? By &s;in every favour was forfeited, and he is the <HI>Saviour of all men, e&s;pecially of tho&s;e that believe.</HI> 1 Tim. iv. 10. The rock which all I&s;rael drank of was Chri&s;t. 1 Cor. x. 4, 5.

Which words were perverted by antichri&s;t, to prove the doctrine of purgatory, and are now brought to prove general &s;alvation. But Chri&s;t a&s;&s;ures us, that if any one is not recon|ciled before he be <HI>ca&s;t into pri&s;on,</HI> he &s;hall <HI>by no means come out thence, till he has paid the uttermo&s;t farthing.</HI> Mat. v. 25, 26. <HI>Com|mon</HI> &s;alvations to all, as well as <HI>&s;pecial</HI> ones to believers, are all from Chri&s;t; and to conceit that the former are to be looked for el&s;e|where, has ruined multitudes. We are warned again&s;t <HI>oppo&s;ition of &s;cience, fal&s;ely &s;o called.</HI> The conceit, that &s;cience for time, and &s;cience for eternity, are oppo&s;ite things, is a mo&s;t fatal delu&s;ion. 1 Tim. iv. 7&mdash;9, and vi. 1&mdash;21. Do not err, my beloved brethren, every good gift comes from the Father of lights. Jam. i. 16, 17, and iv. 13&mdash;17.

Job i. 10, 12, and xlii. 10&mdash;12. Luke viii. 32&mdash;39. What fools then are all they who yield to deceit and cruelty (which is wor&s;hip|ping the devil) to obtain any earthly good! In the &s;econd and third centuries he prevailed with Chri&s;tian teachers to adopt it as a max|im, that it was a virtue to <HI>deceive and lie</HI> for a good end. And in the fourth century Con&s;tantine was drawn into this &s;cheme; when they added, that it was a virtue to inflict <HI>temporal penalties, and cor|poral tortures,</HI> for the &s;ame end. And this veil has been &s;pread over the nations ever &s;ince. Indeed it would have &s;poiled the de|&s;ign, to have proclaimed it to all the people. Much pains were taken to keep it as a &s;ecret, betwixt civil and religious officers. But the terrible &s;hakings that have lately taken place, in earthly &s;tates, and religious communities, have di&s;covered this deceit, and cau&s;ed mens hearts to fail them. For if a man may lie for a good end, he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be the judge of that end; therefore when it is perceived that he acts upon &s;uch a principle, others never know when to believe him, nor how to tru&s;t him. And what di&s;tre&s;s does this now cau&s;e through the world! This leads me to a glo|rious promi&s;e, which Mr. Winche&s;ter builds much upon, in his arguments again&s;t us, viz. <HI>death &s;hall be &s;wallowed up in victory.</HI></P>
<P>God being the fountain of life, the fir&s;t &s;en&s;e of the word death is lo&s;s of union and communion with him. Three points are mo&s;t &s;trongly a&s;&s;erted of his character, which are, that it is <HI>impo&s;&s;ible</HI> for him to <HI>lie,</HI> to <HI>deny him&s;elf,</HI> or to <HI>entice</HI> any into &s;in. 2 Tim. ii. 13. Heb. vi. 18. James i. 13. Every thing that happens of this nature proceeds from fallen angels, and fallen men, who are much alike. The &s;econd &s;en&s;e of the word death is the di&s;&s;olution of our bo|dies, including the means of it, as di&s;orders in our&s;elves, and vio|lence from others. <HI>Murder</HI> and <HI>lying</HI> form the character of the devil and his children. John viii. 44. And the infliction of ju&s;t puni&s;h|ment therefor, compleats the full &s;en&s;e of tho&s;e dreadful terms, <HI>death</HI> and <HI>hell,</HI> as they are u&s;ed in &s;cripture. And the indulgence of known deceit and cruelty appears to be the covenant with death, and agreement with hell, that &s;cornful men in power have often imagined to &s;ecure them&s;elves by. Such have frequently treated the warnings of truth with <HI>mockery</HI>; and thereby the <HI>bands</HI> of many have been <HI>made &s;trong.</HI> They rea&s;on thus, <HI>is not the Lord among us? none evil can come upon us.</HI> From a negative propo&s;ition they form a po&s;itive conclu&s;ion. For any &s;oul to profe&s;s that Chri&s;t is <HI>in him,</HI> and that he has the <HI>witne&s;s of it in him&s;elf,</HI> this they cannot endure, and why? becau&s;e, if that be nece&s;&s;ary and attainable, I am con|demned without it, and in neglect of it. Self-defence, therefore, moves them to oppo&s;e &s;uch things, and to &s;ay, <HI>when the overflowing &s;courge &s;hall pa&s;s through, it &s;hall not come unto us.</HI> But God has promi&s;ed to e&s;tabli&s;h the mountain of <HI>his hou&s;e above</HI> all &s;uch pow|ers, and to make a glorious fea&s;t there. Even a fea&s;t which &s;hall cau&s;e many nations to <HI>flow</HI> thereto, as freely as the waters ever

ran; with this language, <HI>come and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the hou&s;e of the God of Jacob, and he will teach us of</HI> HIS <HI>ways, and we will walk in</HI> HIS <HI>paths.</HI> The effect whereof will be the turning of &s;words into in&s;truments of agriculture, and bringing wars to an end. The <HI>covering</HI> and <HI>veil</HI> over the nations &s;hall be de&s;troyed, and <HI>death &s;wallowed up in victory.</HI> 1 John ii. 21, and iii. 14. Prov. viii. 36. I&s;ai. xxv. 6, 7, and xxviii. 14&mdash;22. Micah iii. 11, and iv. 1&mdash;5. The only lawful u&s;e of the &s;word before is to defend the injured again&s;t tho&s;e who would <HI>hurt or de&s;troy.</HI> I&s;ai. xi. 9, 10. Rom. xiii. 1&mdash;10. To the redeemed death will then be entirely &s;wallowed up; their enemies all be di&s;armed and &s;ubdued, and their &s;orrows turned into joy. Mal. iv. 1&mdash;3. 1 Cor. xv. 54&mdash;58. But at the &s;ame time God will lay judgment to the line, and righteou&s;ne&s;s to the plummet, in &s;uch a manner, that impeni|tent &s;corners will have neither <HI>covering</HI> nor <HI>re&s;t</HI>; but a perpetual <HI>vexation, only to under&s;tand the report.</HI> Which <HI>report</HI> plainly intends the go&s;pel that they rejected. I&s;ai. liii. 1. Rom. x. 16. <HI>Victory</HI> and <HI>triumph</HI> mean honor and joy to the victors; but when were the words ever u&s;ed, either for the annihilation or for the happi|ne&s;s of all enemies? Can &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of tho&s;e terms be found in language? If not, it is arbitrary with a witne&s;s to impo&s;e &s;uch a &s;en&s;e upon the word of God. See 2 Cor. ii. 14&mdash;17. Col. ii. 15. P&s;alm xlvii. 1&mdash;3, and lxviii. 18. If I&s;ai. xxviii. 14&mdash;22, be com|pared with Mat. vii. 24&mdash;27, it appears, that while believers who hear Chri&s;t's <HI>&s;ayings, and do them,</HI> will enjoy eternal &s;ecurity, all that are of the oppo&s;ite character will be overthrown by the &s;torm.</P>
<P>The mi&s;ery of fallen men lies greatly in this; they fir&s;t &s;et up the idol in their heart, and then come to enquire of God. This was the error of Balaam. But if we were willing to learn of Je&s;us, and to do his &s;ayings; to take all our ideas from the word of truth, and to act accordingly, how happy &s;hould we be? Chri&s;t calls us <HI>this day to work,</HI> as much as ever Mo&s;es did; but the latter &s;tipu|lates the price for it; the other promi&s;es the &s;oul that it &s;hall <HI>receive what is right,</HI> he being the judge. Debt is a reward promi&s;ed for a certain &s;ervice; and which may be claimed when the &s;ervice is performed, whatever difference there may be in value betwixt the &s;ervice and the reward. God, as the moral Governor of the world, never fails to pay all his debts; that is, to reward every one for any &s;ervice that is in any &s;en&s;e good; but man would claim more, and, like Cain, are often filled with wrath, becau&s;e others are accepted and they not. But in the great day he will &s;top every mouth with this que&s;tion; <HI>Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil, becau&s;e I am good?</HI> Mat. xx. 1&mdash;16. All the conte&s;t turns upon that point. To name &s;uch a thing as his <HI>cho&s;en,</HI> or his <HI>elect,</HI> as intending a certain number of the human race that he will &s;ave, while he inflicts de&s;erved puni&s;hment upon the re&s;t, this many cannot endure; and why? becau&s;e if his will,

his choice, mu&s;t determine the whole matter, it is infinitely dan|gerous for me to &s;et up my will again&s;t him. And it is al&s;o certain from hence, that if I do &s;o, I cannot po&s;&s;ibly &s;ucceed; and when I am entirely defeated, it will lie wholly with him whether he will &s;hew me any mercy or not. Dreadful thought! Who can bear it! Any thing mu&s;t be li&s;tened to rather than this. In July, 1780, I heard Mr. Winche&s;ter preach in Bo&s;ton, from Rom. x. 4; when he &s;pake again&s;t univer&s;al &s;alvation, and ob&s;erved, that if men ran to &s;uch horrid extravagances as they did, in times when it was not di&s;puted but that &s;uch as died in &s;in would have endle&s;s mi&s;ery, what would they do if they were taught that every one &s;hould finally be &s;aved? Among the many objections that he has now attempted to an&s;wer, I think he has pa&s;&s;ed this over in &s;ilence, which is no clear proof that he thought it could be an&s;wered. But if God is continually &s;eeking to make every creature happy, why does he not do it? If ob&s;tructions thereto have aro&s;e that he did not fore&s;ee, where was his wi&s;dom? If he fore&s;aw them, and could not prevent them, where was his power? And if he could have prevented them, and did not, where was his goodne&s;s? A fair an&s;wer to the&s;e que&s;|tions will &s;ettle the whole controver&s;y.</P>
<P>A clear right to property, and a good right to govern, are two very plain ideas. And it is al&s;o well known, that property cannot be holden, nor government maintained, without &s;ome token of acknowledgment is paid, by the tenant and the &s;ubject. For this token from Adam, God re&s;erved but one tree to him&s;elf; therefore by eating of it man rebelled again&s;t heaven, and &s;eized upon the earth for his own. And when God had u&s;ed &s;uch other methods as he plea&s;ed, he &s;ent his only begotten Son, to demand his due; but the tenants &s;aid, <HI>this is the heir, come let us kill him, and let us &s;eize on his inheritance.</HI> Mat. xxi. 38. And the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition of rob|bery and violence is vi&s;ible through the world to this day. And now it is openly declared, that God did not act arbitrarily in tho&s;e affairs. If he could have had his own will and plea&s;ure, he would never have put man to &s;uch a trial; and does not arbitrarily inflict puni&s;hment upon him, poor creature, now he has fallen, and has got into &s;uch a terrible labyrinth! However, he intends yet to deliver him before he quits his pur&s;uit, though it will be "ages of ages before the work is perfected!" If this does not di&s;cover an infinite malignity in &s;in, what can it be!</P>
<P>We mu&s;t deny that there is an infinite dignity in the per&s;on of Je&s;us, or el&s;e allow that there was an infinite merit in his death. And to deny his right to be&s;tow the fruits thereof upon whom he plea&s;eth, would be to deny him that right to property, which is claimed by every freeman upon earth. To &s;ay that he owes us tho&s;e fruits, is the height of madne&s;s! And he declares to all what will be the i&s;&s;ue of the conte&s;t, with tho&s;e who &s;ay, <HI>we will not have this man to reign over us.</HI> Luke xix. 14&mdash;27. Let all wake up then,
<PB N="37" REF="017464_0037_0FA124722FAF2F10">
and &s;ee where we are! The whole di&s;pute that we have been upon is about the extent of promi&s;ed &s;alvation. Who has promi&s;ed any &s;uch thing? An&s;wer, all the promi&s;es of God are in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, yea, and in him amen, to the glory of God, by his church. Did why prince ever i&s;&s;ue a proclamation of grace to rebels, without any re&s;trictions? And was it ever thought among men, that it was in|con&s;i&s;tent with ju&s;tice, truth or mercy, to give exact de&s;criptions of &s;ome particular characters of rebels, and to except &s;uch out of the general act of grace? and was it ever called mockery, in&s;ult, and in&s;incerity, to call all the re&s;t to come in, with a free promi&s;e of pardon and life, if they came in by the certain time that was &s;ee? Is not ju&s;tice and truth as much concerned in vindicating the rights and honor of government, by exemplary puni&s;hment upon the con|temners thereof, as in &s;hewing mercy to penitents? And can there be any dependence made upon what Chri&s;t has &s;aid, if he has not except|ed &s;ome &s;ort of &s;inners out of his go&s;pel proclamation? yea, and declared that &s;uch will have a much &s;orer puni&s;hment than &s;inners again&s;t the light of nature, or the law of Mo&s;es? Luke x. 11&mdash;16. Heb. vi. 6, and x. 28, 29, and xii. 25, 26. No pardon was ever promi&s;ed to men who <HI>pre&s;umptuou&s;ly</HI> and <HI>de&s;pitefully</HI> acted again&s;t the light. Num. xv. 27&mdash;31. P&s;alm xix. 13. Mat. xii. 31, 32. And the cau&s;e why Paul obtained mercy was his &s;inning <HI>ignorantly,</HI> and not <HI>pre&s;umptuou&s;ly.</HI> 1 Tim. i. 13. Now it has been proved, that to expect and claim promi&s;ed ble&s;&s;ings, in a way of di&s;regard to his precepts, is pre&s;umption, and tempting of God. Concerning &s;uch, he &s;wore that they &s;hould not enter into his re&s;t. A chief leader in this way &s;aid to Mo&s;es and Aaron, <HI>all the congregation are holy, every one of them; wherefore then lift you up your&s;elves?</HI> But the command to the people was, <HI>depart from the tents of the&s;e wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs.</HI> Num. xvi. 3&mdash;26. Which things are recorded for a warning to all. Jude 11.</P>
<P>Fury in men often operates unrea&s;onably; of this there is nothing in God. And his debates with his vineyard are in exact <HI>mea&s;ure,</HI> and to <HI>purge away &s;in.</HI> But <HI>withered boughs</HI> will be ca&s;t into the <HI>fire; for it is a people of no under&s;tanding; therefore he that made them will not have mercy on them; and he that formed them will &s;hew them no fa|vour.</HI> I&s;ai. xxvii. 4&mdash;11. This appears to be the only place in the bible where fury is &s;aid not to be in God; while the word is ap|plied to his righteous vengeance upon the wicked near fifty times therein. And though Winche&s;ter has referred us to above &s;ixty places, to prove that the words everla&s;ting, forever, &amp;c. are u&s;ed in a limited &s;en&s;e, p. 37, 38, yet all but two of them are in the old te&s;tament, when they were under &s;hadows which were to end, while the &s;ub&s;tances they typified were to continue. And his two proofs out of the new te&s;tament are the&s;e, viz. Paul &s;peake to Philemon of receiving his &s;ervant forever. But how? not now as a &s;ervant, But as a beloved brother; and will that relation ever end? Again, in
<PB N="38" REF="017464_0038_0FA12473F7EB8958">
Rev. xiv. 6. the word everla&s;ting is evidently connected with the word go&s;pel, and not with the preaching it upon earth; and is not the go&s;pel of an endle&s;s nature? The&s;e are his only proofs from the new te&s;tament, to limit the &s;en&s;e of tho&s;e words. And his party are forced to confe&s;s that the duration of mi&s;ery, and the continu|ance of happine&s;s, are both expre&s;&s;ed by the &s;ame Greek word in Mat. xxv. 46. And if the words u&s;ed in Rev. xx. 10, to expre&s;s the continuance of puni&s;hment in the <HI>burning lake,</HI> do not mean endle&s;s duration, Dr. Doddrige &s;ays, it is hard to &s;ay what words can do it. And by &s;uffering &s;inners, in various ways, to exert them&s;elves as far as creature power can po&s;&s;ibly go, how will their defeat and confu&s;ion demon&s;trate the folly of not following divine direction entirely! And while their defeat, confu&s;ion and mi&s;ery, are ever vi&s;ible to the ble&s;&s;ed, what reverence, e&s;teem, joy, and prai&s;e to their God and Saviour, will it ever excite in redeemed &s;ouls! And angels will join their &s;ong. I&s;ai. lxvi. 24. Luke xiii. 27&mdash;29. Rev. xiv. 10, and xix. 1&mdash;6.</P>
<P>In a word, if any one of the human race is finally lo&s;t, the &s;cheme we oppo&s;e mu&s;t be fal&s;e. And he who cannot err &s;ays of one of them, <HI>good were it for that man if he had never been born.</HI> The way Winche&s;ter takes here, is to prove that Job and Jeremiah wi&s;hed that they had not been born, who&s;e &s;ufferings were light and &s;hort to what Judas's will be. P. 42, 43. But will he lift up his head, and argue again, that becau&s;e good men were mi&s;taken, that there|fore Chri&s;t was al&s;o! In the next page he mentions what Solomon &s;ays, about an extraordinary long life, and large family, to a wicked man; and that an untimely birth would be better than his. Eccl. vi. 3&mdash;6. From whence he argues, that Chri&s;t's meaning was, that if Judas had died in the womb, it would have been good for him; that then
<Q>he would have been at re&s;t, where the wicked cea&s;e from troubling, and where the weary are at re&s;t.</Q>
But as certainly as the Bible is true, all things do <HI>work together for the good</HI> of all the objects of <HI>God's love.</HI> Rom. viii. 28. Therefore if Judas had been an object of that love, it would have been good for him to have been born, and to go through all that he did; as it real|ly was for Job and Jeremiah, though they once thought otherwi&s;e. Till a fair an&s;wer can be given to this argument, I think it need|le&s;s to follow my opponent any further. And &s;hall clo&s;e with naming a few plain &s;cripture rules of decency and go&s;pel order, with &s;ome motives to enforce them.</P>

Chri&s;t is head of all principality and power, and the church is compleat in him; and every &s;oul who truly receives him, re|ceives him as &s;uch; and is commanded to walk in Chri&s;t <HI>as he received him, as he has been taught.</HI> Therefore we are required, not to let men or angels intrude their commands or judgments be|twixt the believer and his glorious head. Gal. 1.8, 9. Col. ii. 6&mdash;23.</P>
<P N="2">2. In admi&s;&s;ion of members, let every church be careful that
<PB N="39" REF="017464_0039_0FA12474722134C8">
they receive none but &s;uch as give a per&s;onal credible profe&s;&s;ion of a &s;aving union to Chri&s;t by faith. Luke vi. 45. John i. 12&mdash;14. Acts ii. 47. Rom. x. 10.</P>
<P N="3">3. Let all teachers endeavour to u&s;e &s;ound &s;peech, which cannot be condemned; words ea&s;y to be under&s;tood, and which give a di&s;|tinct and certain &s;ound; and be as willing that others &s;hould judge, as they are to &s;peak. 1 Cor. xiv. 7&mdash;40. Titus ii. 7, 8.</P>
<P N="4">4. In public communities, let men ever have the lead and govern|ment; &s;o that when women are heard, and all due regard is paid to them in their places, it may be done in &s;uch a manner, that it &s;hall &s;till be evident that they are not heads and governors of public a&s;&s;emblies, but under covert. Luke ii. 38. 1 Cor. xi. 3&mdash;16, xiv. 34, 35. 1 Tim. ii. 11, 12.</P>
<P N="5">5. Exclude all &s;triving about who &s;hall be the greate&s;t, and by love &s;erve one another. Let due e&s;teem and a&s;&s;i&s;tance be given to offi|cers in their places; while all are &s;ubject one to another, and be cloath|ed with humility: For God re&s;i&s;teth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble. Luke ix. 46&mdash;50. Heb. xiii. 7, 17. 1 Pet. v. 1&mdash;5.</P>
<P N="6">6. Let all be upon their guard again&s;t teachers who are fond of addre&s;&s;ing the pa&s;&s;ions, and putting animal nature into motion, without enlightening the under&s;tanding, convincing the con&s;cience, and e&s;tabli&s;hing the judgment. Jer. iii. 15. Acts xxv. 18. 2 Cor. iv. 2. Eph. iv. 14&mdash;16. Heb. xiii. 9.</P>
<P N="7">7. Be not &s;lothful in bu&s;ine&s;s, but fervent in &s;pirit, &s;erving the Lord; and indulge not the di&s;po&s;ition of eating any man's bread for naught. Rom. xii. 2 The&s;&s;. iii. 6&mdash;12.</P>
<P>With regard to this la&s;t rule, two great extremes have long &s;erved to uphold each other. Mini&s;ters who have been &s;upported by tax and compul&s;ion have frequently eat other men's bread for naught. Seeing of which has carried many into the oppo&s;ite extreme. Some have gone &s;o far as to elect pa&s;tors, and to partake of the fruit of their labours from year to year, without thinking them&s;elves under obligation to &s;upport them in their work, or to reward them there|for. Neither honor nor con&s;cience would have permitted either party to act as they have done, if it had not been in religious affairs. When believers view the glory and <HI>authority</HI> of their Lord and Saviour, it moves them mo&s;t <HI>freely</HI> and faithfully to attend to the duties of their &s;tation, be they in office or out of it, in church or &s;tate. They <HI>choo&s;e the things that plea&s;e him</HI>; and to fill up their places with duty and u&s;efulne&s;s is their greate&s;t concern; knowing that &s;uch labour cannot be in vain in the Lord. But violence has &s;o long been connected with <HI>authority,</HI> on one hand, and licen|tiou&s;ne&s;s with the word <HI>freedom</HI> on the other, that it is not an ea&s;y matter to &s;eparate them in the minds of men. But what wor&s;hip mu&s;t it be, that can influence any to lay &s;uch a claim to the goods or labours of others, as truth and equity between man and man will not give! Much light in the&s;e things is already granted in our land,
<PB N="40" REF="017464_0040_0FA124752E8E9828">
and it is hoped that a greater reformation is before us. To promote which, the following con&s;iderations may be &s;erviceable.</P>
<P N="1">1. Only by pride cometh contention, and the love of money is the root of all evil. Prov. xiii. 10. 1 Tim. vi. 10. Which evi|dently are imaginations that we can do better for our&s;elves, than God would do for us, if we were entirely directed by him; and that we have a better right to power and property, than our neighbours have. But how great is this delu&s;ion! When &s;ouls are reconciled to God, and act in union and communion with him, their greate&s;t trials and afflictions work together for their everla&s;ting good. Whereas each man who regards &s;elf above God, all that he gets in that way increa&s;es his mi&s;ery: For the more he has got of a &s;eparate intere&s;t of his own, the more he has to take care of and defend, both again&s;t God and man; a woful ta&s;k indeed! The great events of a &s;even years war now hold up a &s;triking demon&s;tration of this truth to all the world.</P>
<P N="2">2. Self-condemnation of all things is the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite to happi|ne&s;s. And though men have various ways to blind or bribe their con&s;ciences now, in violating the golden rule, yet the day is ha&s;ten|ing that will remove all &s;uch coverings forever. It will then be &s;aid, to &s;uch as die in their &s;ins, <HI>remember that thou in thy life-time received&s;t thy good things; but now&mdash;a great gulf is fixed. How much &s;he hath glorified her&s;elf, and lived deliciou&s;ly, &s;o much torment and &s;or|row give her.</HI> Luke xvi. 25, 26. Rev. xviii. 7. And never will they be again able either to conceal their &s;hame, or to be in&s;en&s;ible of their guilt. In vain do &s;ome pretend that the rich man had a good &s;eed within him, becau&s;e he was &s;o earne&s;t that his brethren might not come to that place of torment; which, they &s;ay, is con|trary to the temper of devils. For the devils are deceived, as well as men; and pray as earne&s;tly as they again&s;t torment, when in their immediate view. Luke viii. 28&mdash;31. And it is as vain to argue, that there cannot be different degrees of puni&s;hment, if hell-torments are without end.</P>
<P N="3">3. Every &s;oul now is either a &s;lave to &s;in, or a &s;ervant of righ|teou&s;ne&s;s; either under the <HI>bondage of corruption,</HI> or in the <HI>liberty of God's children,</HI> in a greater or le&s;s degree. Rom. vi. 16, and viii. 9&mdash;21. Our pre&s;ent as well as eternal welfare is therefore what immediately concerns this pre&s;ent argument. The more we can ob|tain of victory over corruption, and of real conformity to the will of God, the happier we are here. Great peace have all they who love his law, and nothing &s;hall offend them; but they who walk after their own lu&s;ts, are <HI>murmurers</HI> and <HI>complainers.</HI> Jude 16. Could it therefore be po&s;&s;ible, that the torments of the damned would have an end, yet we are certainly as &s;afe as our opponents; but, on the other hand, what a ri&s;k do they run in their way! If rea&s;on can be heard, it will make every one in earne&s;t to know and live to GOD.</P>
