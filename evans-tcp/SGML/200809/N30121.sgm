<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_THE Nature and End of all Civil Government is <HI>Salus Populi,</HI> and altho Civil Government in different Empires, Kingdoms, Republicks and Provinces, appear in different modes and &s;hapes, yet the true end and de&s;ign of all their E&s;tabli&s;hments are one and the &s;ame, <HI>i. e. Salus Populi.</HI></P>
<P>For which end under the Engli&s;h OEconomy Judges and Juries are appointed: To Hear, Try, and finally to do impartial Ju&s;tice to all Per&s;ons what&s;oever: and may all Judges who &s;hall fail in their Duty through Bribery or De&s;ign meet with a ju&s;t Puni&s;hment, not inferior to what befel tho&s;e unhappy Wretches (once the happy Favourites of &s;ome of our greate&s;t Kings) who are Hung up in Terrorem (as by the following Sheets will appear) that others may hear and fear and do no more &s;o wickedly, le&s;t an equal if not a wor&s;e Puni&s;hment be Executed upon them.</P>
<P>It's very <HI>Terrible</HI> when <HI>LION</HI>-like Judges appear upon <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Benches, who neglect the <HI>Law</HI> and act generally by the Power of their own <HI>Will.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Con&s;titution</HI> mu&s;t certainly when it &s;o happens (and &s;uch Judges Male Admini&s;tration pa&s;s with Impunity) be in the utmo&s;t Danger; it's therefore thought nothing would be more acceptable to the Publick than <HI>The Triumphs of Ju&s;tice over Unju&s;t Judges;</HI> and as it is for the Information of all, &s;o it is hop'd, it will be a Warning to all, e&s;pecially Civil Officers; for which purpo&s;e the di&s;mal Narrative of the deadly Cata&s;trophy of &s;o many <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Judges is Reprinted.</P>

<HEAD>THE Triumphs of Ju&s;tice OVER <HI>Vnju&s;t Iudges, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HI></HEAD>
<P>_UNDOUBTEDLY there may be, becau&s;e there has been too often in the World; &s;uch a thing, &s;uch a &s;in, &s;uch a mi&s;chief, as <HI>Cor|ruption of Judges,</HI> that is, when by means of Pecuniary, or other Bribes, or (which is all out as bad) Threatnings, Promi&s;es of Reward, Malice, Revenge, hopes of greater, or fears of being turned out of pre&s;ent Preferments, or any other ill motive; They that are appointed and Sworn to Admini&s;ter <HI>equal</HI> and <HI>impartial</HI> Right and Ju&s;tice, are wrap'd a&s;ide, or <HI>Bias'd</HI> to <HI>&s;erve a Turn, or Wreck</HI> a <HI>private Grudge,</HI> or to <HI>free the Guilty,</HI> or <HI>condemn the Innocent;</HI> or to lean rather to the one &s;ide, than to the other; or wilfully to declare that to be <HI>Law,</HI> which they cannot but know is not &s;o; or to adjudge puni&s;hments <HI>di&s;proportionate</HI> to the Crimes that appear before them, or any the like <HI>ba&s;e illegal</HI> practi&s;es.</P>
<P>How odious this Vice is, to <HI>God and Man,</HI> as being equally de&s;tructive to Religion, and Humane Society; and how &s;everely it has been heretofore puni&s;hed, by both, may appear by The En&s;uing Examples.</P>
<P N="1">1. As to God, who is <HI>Capitalis Ju&s;titiarius Caeli &amp; Terrae,</HI> the Grand never|erring Ju&s;titiary of all the World. His Sacred Word prohibits nothing more po&s;itively nor complain of any thing lowder, or with more repeated importu|nities. <HI>Thou &s;halt not re&s;t the judgment of the poor in his cau&s;e; Thou &s;halt take no gift, for a gift blindeth the eye of the wi&s;e, and perverteth the words of the Righteous,</HI> Exod. 23.6. and 8. ver. <HI>Thou &s;halt not re&s;t judgment; thou &s;halt not re|&s;pect per&s;ons, neither take a gift,</HI> &amp;c. Deut. 16.19. Woe <HI>unto them that ju&s;tifie the wicked for reward, and taketh away the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the righteous from him,</HI> I&s;a. 5.23. <HI>A wicked man taketh a gift out of the bo&s;ome</HI> ('tis done you &s;ee <HI>&s;lyly,</HI> and in the <HI>dark) to pervert the ways of judgment,</HI> Prov. 17.23 <HI>Woe unto <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e
<PB N="2" REF="040005_0006_1015BDEA14422458">
who turn judgment into wormwood, and leave off righteou&s;ne&s;s in the earth,</HI> Amos 5.7 <HI>The good man is peri&s;hed out of the earth, and there is none upright among&s;t men; They all lye in wait for blood; they hunt every man his brother as with a net, that they may do evil with both hands earne&s;tly. The Prince asketh, and the Judge gapeth for a reward; and the great man uttereth his mi&s;chievous de|&s;ire, &s;o they wrap it up: the be&s;t of them is as a briar, the mo&s;t upright is &s;harper than a thorn hedg,</HI> &amp;c. Mic. 7.2, 3, &amp; 4 ver. with many of the like Texts.</P>
<P N="2">2. As corrupt Judges are thus obnoxious to the <HI>Cur&s;e of God,</HI> &s;o hath his Divine Providence not &s;eldome Executed it upon them even in this world by the hands of <HI>men.</HI> Nor indeed is there any thing that can render <HI>Kings</HI> (Gods Vicegerents) more <HI>Glorious,</HI> or better e&s;tabli&s;h any <HI>&s;tate,</HI> than to keep the Current of <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> clear and unfullied; and exemplarily to puni&s;h their Subordinate <HI>Mini&s;ters,</HI> and e&s;pecially <HI>Judges</HI> that &s;hall pre&s;ume to <HI>impoi&s;on</HI> that Sacred <HI>Fountain.</HI></P>
<P>Several Heathen Princes are Renowned for this whole&s;om &s;everity. 'Tis &s;aid of <HI>Alexander Severus</HI> the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperor, that he had &s;uch an aver&s;ion and abhorrence of unju&s;t Judges, that at the very &s;ight of them he would vomit <HI>Choler,</HI> and was ready with his fingers to <HI>pluck out their eyes. Theatrum Hi&s;toricum, f.</HI> 546.</P>
<P>The Mighty Monarch <HI>Camby&s;es,</HI> King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> finding that one <HI>Si&s;amnes</HI> his <HI>Chief Ju&s;tice (Proe&s;es</HI> our Author calls him in <HI>Latin</HI>) had receiv'd a <HI>Bribe,</HI> and for the &s;ame pronounced an unju&s;t Sentence, forthwith cau&s;ed him to be Executed, and curiou&s;ly flead, and with his skin cover'd the <HI>Common Seat</HI> of Ju&s;tice, and Con&s;tituted <HI>Otanes</HI> (the &s;aid <HI>Si&s;amnes</HI>'s own Son) Judge in his Room; That &s;o beholding daily tho&s;e <HI>Reliques</HI> of his ju&s;tly-puni&s;ht Father; It might &s;erve as a <HI>Memento</HI> to him to act more uprightly. <HI>Chronicon Carionis. l.</HI> 2. <HI>p.</HI> 19.</P>
<P>But not to &s;earch &s;o far off, our own Nation affords us (perhaps) the mo&s;t notable and numerous Examples of <HI>Royal Ju&s;tice</HI> in this kind of any in the world. For we find it Recorded in that Antient Law-Book, Entituled, The <HI>Mirrour</HI> of <HI>Ju&s;tices</HI> (mo&s;t of which is &s;aid to be Compiled before the <HI>Conque&s;t,</HI> and Augmented by the Learned <HI>Andrew Horn</HI> in the Reign of K. <HI>Edward</HI> the 1&s;t. and which is often Cited by the Famous Lord <HI>Coke,</HI> and to this day continues in good Repute among&s;t Lawyers) That King <HI>Alfred,</HI> a Renowned <HI>Saxon</HI> Prince, who Governed this Realm about the Year of our Lord 900. did in one years &s;pace bring to Condign puni&s;hment, <HI>no fewer than four and forty of his Ju&s;tices,</HI> (&s;o the Law Terms tho&s;e we call Judges; and this was long before, either Ju&s;tices of the Peace E&s;tabli&s;ht, or the Courts fixed at <HI>We&s;tmin|&s;ter:</HI> But Ju&s;tice was in tho&s;e days Admini&s;tred in the Country, in Neigh|bouring Courts, which yet (as appears by the nature of the offences alledged again&s;t them) had <HI>jus vitae &amp; necis, power of life and death,</HI> and &s;o may pro|perly be called Judges) who&s;e Names and particular Crimes here follow in the words of that worthy Author, <HI>p.</HI> 296, of the <HI>French,</HI> and <HI>p.</HI> 239 of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Edition.</P>

We for the avoiding of the&s;e, and the like Dangers; well Weigh|ing with our &s;elf, that where the Good, and Safety of the Kingdom in general is concern'd, and the whole Kingdom in Danger, there the Charge, and De|fence ought to be Borne by all the Realm in general, did for the preventing &s;o publick a Mi&s;chief, re&s;olve with our &s;elf, to have a Royal Navy prepared, that might be of Force and Power (with Almighty GOD's Ble&s;&s;ing and A&s;|&s;i&s;tance) to Protect, and Defend this our Realm, and our Subjects therein, from all &s;uch Perils and Dangers: And for that purpo&s;e, we I&s;&s;ued forth Writs under our great Seal of <HI>England,</HI> Directed to all our Sheriffs of our &s;everal Counties of <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>Wales;</HI> Commanding thereby all our &s;aid Subjects in every City, Town, and Village, to provide &s;uch a Number of Ships well-furni&s;ht, as might &s;erve for this Royal Purpo&s;e; and which might be done with the greate&s;t Equality that could be. In performance whereof, though generally throughout all the Counties of this our Realm, we have found in our Subjects, great Chearfulne&s;s, and Alacrity; which we Graciou&s;ly Interpret as a Te&s;ti|mony, as well of their Dutiful Affection to us, and our Service, as of the Re|&s;pect they have to the Publick, which well becometh every good Subject. Neverthele&s;s, finding that &s;ome few happily out of Ignorance, what the Laws and Cu&s;toms of this Realm are, or out of a de&s;ire to be ea&s;ed in their Particu|lars, how General &s;oever their Charge be, or ought to be, have not yet Paid, and Contributed to their &s;everal Rates, and Se&s;sments that were &s;et upon them. And fore&s;eeing in our Princely Wi&s;dom, divers Suits and Actions, are not un|like to be Commenced, and Pro&s;ecuted in our &s;everal Courts at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter:</HI> We de&s;irous to avoid &s;uch Inconveniencies, and out of our Princely Love, and Affection to all our People, being willing to prevent &s;uch Errors as any of our Loving Subjects may happen to run into; have thought fit, in a Ca&s;e of this Nature, to Advi&s;e with our Judges, who we doubt not are well Studied, and Informed in the Rights of our Sovereignty; and becau&s;e the Tryals of our &s;everal Courts, by the Formalities in Pleading, will require a long Protraction, We have thought fit by this Letter directed to you All, to require your Judg|ments in the <HI>Ca&s;e,</HI> as it is &s;et down in the Inclo&s;ed Paper; which will not only gain Time, but al&s;o be of more Authority to over-rule any Prejudicate Opinions of others in the Point.</P>

<P>This being a <HI>Great</HI> and <HI>General Ca&s;e,</HI> the Barons of the <HI>Exchequer,</HI> de&s;ired the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the re&s;t of the <HI>Judges,</HI> who did Joyn accordingly.

<P><HI>Quod &s;eperalia Brevia predicta, &amp; Retorn' eorundem, ac Schedul' praedict' ei&s;dem An|nex' ac materia in ei&s;dem content' &s;ufficient' in Lege Exi&s;i' ad praefat</HI> Johannen Hampden <HI>de predictis viginti &s;olidis &s;uper ip&s;um informa, &amp; ex cau&s;a praedictae A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ae onerand. Ideo con&s;ideratum e&s;t per eo&s;dem Barones quod praedictus</HI> Johannes Hampden <HI>de ei&s;dem viginti &s;olidis oneretur, &amp; inde &s;atisfaciat: That the &s;aid &s;everal Writs and Returns thereof, and the Schedules thereunto annex't, and the Matter in the &s;ame contained, are &s;ufficient in Law to Charge the &s;aid</HI> John Hampden <HI>with the Twenty Shillings upon him, in the Form, and by Vertue of the A&s;&s;e&s;sment afore|&s;aid impo&s;ed. Therefore, it is con&s;idered by the &s;aid Barons, That the &s;aid</HI> John Hampden <HI>&s;hall be Charged, and &s;hall &s;atisfy the &s;ame.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Judgment</HI> was impo&s;ed, as &s;uch an <HI>Infallible Determination</HI> of the Law in this Ca&s;e, that no further Di&s;pute would be allow'd thereof to any others; in&s;omuch, that a Per&s;on of Honour, having a Ca&s;e depending in the <HI>King</HI>'s-<HI>Bench,</HI> was denyed any Argument or Debate, concerning the <HI>Right</HI> of <HI>Ship-Money,</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="040005_0024_1015BEE97AE4ACE8">
for no other Rea&s;on, but that it had been by the former <HI>Judgment,</HI> de|cided already in the <HI>Exchequer.</HI></P>
<P>It may perhaps be &s;aid: <HI>This Impo&s;ition of</HI> Ship Money <HI>was</HI> &s;mall <HI>and</HI> incon|&s;iderable; <HI>Mr.</HI> Hampden, <HI>a Gentleman of a fair E&s;tate, was A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed but</HI> Twen|ty Shillings: <HI>And, Why &s;hould any Body &s;cruple &s;uch a petty Bu&s;ine&s;s, when the</HI> King <HI>Commanded it? Was not the</HI> Redemy <HI>far wor&s;e than the</HI> Di&s;ea&s;e? <HI>Why &s;hould any Subject ex&s;pend a great deal of Money in Law, to avoid Payment of &s;o</HI> Trivial <HI>a Sum? Or, What Harm could accrue to the</HI> Publick, <HI>by the</HI> Judges <HI>allowing the</HI> King <HI>Power to Impo&s;e &s;uch an A&s;&s;e&s;sment, when it was for the De|fence of the Realm from</HI> Eminent <HI>and</HI> Imminent <HI>Danger, and he exerted that Power &s;o favourably,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>In <HI>An&s;wer</HI> to &s;uch <HI>Objections,</HI> it mu&s;t be &s;aid; That true it is, it was then only Mr. <HI>Hampden</HI>'s Ca&s;e; but the whole Nation, every individual Subject of <HI>England,</HI> was concern'd in it: nay, &s;o far concern'd, that all his E&s;tate and Li|berty was therein given up. The <HI>Que&s;tion</HI> was not <HI>Quantum,</HI> but <HI>Quo Jure</HI>? If Publick Danger might give the <HI>King</HI> Title to lay Impo&s;itions without a <HI>Parliament,</HI> and He alone were <HI>Judge</HI> of &s;uch Danger, When might it not be alledged? If <HI>Twenty Shillings</HI> were A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed on Mr. <HI>Hampden</HI> that Year, How did it appear, but <HI>Twenty Pounds</HI> might be required the next, and <HI>Two Thou|&s;and Pounds</HI> the Year following? And, What U&s;e, what Occa&s;ion would the <HI>Court</HI> have had for ever afterwards of a <HI>Parliament</HI>? But as to the <HI>Illegality</HI> of the&s;e <HI>Ship Writs,</HI> I refer the <HI>Reader</HI> to Judge <HI>Crook's Argument;</HI> where the &s;ame is Demon&s;trated to be again&s;t the <HI>Common Law,</HI> again&s;t divers <HI>Statutes,</HI> not to be maintain'd by any <HI>Prerogative,</HI> or Power Royal, unwarrantable by any former <HI>Precedents,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Let us &s;ee then, what were the <HI>Con&s;equences</HI> of the&s;e <HI>Extra judicial</HI> Opinions, and this <HI>Illegal</HI> Judgment of the <HI>Judges.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> As to the <HI>King:</HI> They thereby mi&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">led him (as much as in them lay) to Di&s;compo&s;e the Harmony of <HI>Government;</HI> to Entrench upon the <HI>Property</HI> of His Subjects; and (contrary to his Intentions) by Colour of Right, to vio|late the Laws, which, do doubt, that <HI>Good Prince</HI> meant to have pre&s;erv'd in|violable</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> As to the <HI>Subjects:</HI> They were not only hereby Injured, but their <HI>Affections Alienated</HI> from their Sovereign; which to occa&s;ion, is to doubt a very High (becau&s;e almo&s;t Irreparable) <HI>Trea&s;on.</HI></P>
<P>The Genuine Sen&s;e of the&s;e <HI>Re&s;olutions,</HI> being no le&s;s than this; That the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> as <HI>often</HI> as Him&s;elf plea&s;eth, may declare the Kingdom to be in Danger, and that &s;o often, His Maje&s;ty, for Prevention of &s;uch Dangers, may, by His Writ under the Great Seal of <HI>England,</HI> alter the <HI>Property</HI> of the Subjects Goods, without their Con&s;ent in <HI>Parliament;</HI> and that in <HI>&s;uch Propor|tions</HI> as His Maje&s;ty &s;hall think fit: And be&s;ides, may deprive them of the <HI>Liberty</HI> of their Per&s;ons, and that in &s;uch Manner as Him&s;elf &s;hall plea&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> As to the <HI>Judges</HI> them&s;elves: It prov'd de&s;ervedly <HI>Fatal;</HI> For no &s;ooner was a <HI>Parliament</HI> Call'd, but they were call'd to Account for the&s;e their Illegal Opinions and Judgment.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="040005_0025_1015BEEBC47D1BE0">And after a long Debate, on <HI>Monday</HI> the <HI>Seventh</HI> of <HI>December,</HI> 1640 the&s;e <HI>Four</HI> &s;everal <HI>Votes</HI> Pa&s;&s;ed upon them, without &s;o much as <HI>One Negative Voice</HI> to any of them, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t, <HI>THat the Charge impo&s;ed upon the Subjects, for the Providing and Fur|ni&s;hing of Ships; and the A&s;&s;e&s;sments for Rai&s;ing of Money for that pur|po&s;e, commonly called Ship-Money, are again&s;t the Laws of the Realm, the Sub|jects Right of Property, and contrary to former Re&s;olutions in Parliament, and to the Petition of Right.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>That the Extrajudicial Opinions of the Judges, Publi&s;hed in the</HI> Star-Chamber, <HI>and Inrolled in Courts as</HI> We&s;tmin&s;ter (<HI>before Recited) in the whole, and in every part of them are again&s;t the Laws of the Realm, the Right of Property, and the Liberty of the Subjects, and contrary to former Re&s;olutions in Parliament; and to the Petition of Right.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>That the writ to the Sheriff of</HI> Bucks <HI>(particularly Recited) and the other Writs, commonly called Ship-Writs; are again&s;t the Laws of the Realm, the Right of Property, and the Liberty of the Subjects, and contrary to former Re&s;o|lutions in Parliament, and to the Petition of Right.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly, <HI>That the Judgment in Mr.</HI> Hampden's <HI>Ca&s;e (as before Recited) in the matter and &s;ub&s;tance thereof; and in that it was conceived that Mr.</HI> Hampden <HI>was any way Chargeable, is again&s;t the Laws of the Realm, the Right of Property, the Liberty of the Subjects, and contrary to former Re&s;olutions in Parliament, and to the Petition of Right.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Votes</HI> being Tran&s;mitted by the <HI>Commons</HI> to the <HI>Hou&s;e of Lords;</HI> Their Lord&s;hips did Concur therein. And on <HI>Fryday</HI> the 26. of <HI>February,</HI> 1640. It was Ordered by the Lords <HI>Spiritual</HI> and <HI>Temporal,</HI> in the High <HI>Court of Par|liament,</HI> A&s;&s;embled; That the <HI>Lord Keeper,</HI> or <HI>Ma&s;ter of the Rolls,</HI> the <HI>Two</HI> Lord <HI>Chief Ju&s;tices,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Chief Baron;</HI> and likewi&s;e the <HI>Chief Clerk of the Star-Chamber,</HI> &s;hould bring into the Upper <HI>Hou&s;e of Parliament,</HI> the <HI>Re|cords</HI> of the Judgment again&s;t Mr. <HI>Hampden,</HI> concerning <HI>Ship-Money,</HI> in each of tho&s;e &s;everal Courts, and that a <HI>Vacat</HI> thereof &s;hould be made.

<P>And &s;oon after, &s;everal of the before-named Judges were <HI>Impeached</HI> for the &s;ame in <HI>Parliament:</HI> And not daring to &s;tand the <HI>Shock,</HI> &s;ome of them, as the Lord <HI>Chief Ju&s;tice Finch,</HI> Fled beyond the Seas; and <HI>others</HI> Ab&s;conded. And &s;oon after, came on the Unnatural <HI>Civil Wars,</HI> &s;o De&s;tructive to <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Kingdom;</HI> which, though no way Ju&s;tifiable, yet it cannot be denied; but they were not a little <HI>Occa&s;ion'd,</HI> and the Animo&s;ities of the People, blown into an

<P>However, after &s;o many di&s;mal Experiences, and fair Warnings, and the Mi|raculous <HI>Re&s;tauration</HI> of His pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, our Gracious Soveraign (whom <HI>God</HI> long Pre&s;erve) a <HI>Prince</HI> of Incomparable Lenity, and Good-natur'd be|yond Example; it might be hoped, that none, Preferr'd to the <HI>Publick Seats of Ju&s;tice,</HI> dur&s;t to have Acted &s;o contrary to His Royal Inclinations, as to violate tho&s;e <HI>Laws,</HI> which He Him&s;elf has <HI>Sworn</HI> to Maintain, and Intru&s;ted them to <HI>Admini&s;ter:</HI> Yet &s;o Ba&s;e and Extravagant are &s;ome, as even to abu&s;e the Favours of the <HI>Be&s;t of Princes,</HI> and pufft up with Preferment, will take no Admonition from the Falls of their <HI>Head-&s;trong</HI> Predece&s;&s;ors; but &s;till pre&s;ume to fully tho&s;e <HI>Ermins,</HI> (the <HI>Emblems</HI> of <HI>Innocency</HI> and <HI>Integrity</HI>) which they wear, and adventure on the &s;ame De&s;tructive Precipices.</P>
<P>You have heard, how heinou&s;ly our Prudent Ance&s;tors re&s;ented the Viola|tion of their <HI>Liberties,</HI> (though by an Act) in Tryals of the Free-born People of <HI>England</HI> WITHOUT JURIES. Next to which, is the <HI>Ruffling, Hectoring,</HI> and <HI>Over-awing</HI> of <HI>Juries:</HI> For, What real Difference is there, betwixt allowing no <HI>Juries</HI> at all, and <HI>Menacing</HI> them into a Compliance (contrary to <HI>Law,</HI> and their own <HI>Con&s;ciences</HI>) with the Corrupt Humours, and Time-&s;erving Intere&s;ts of ill Judges? Of this Crime, the Lord <HI>Chief Ju&s;tice Keeling,</HI> about the Year 1666.

<P>This well contrived, nece&s;&s;ary <HI>Oath,</HI> pre&s;cribed by the Prudence of our Fore-Fathers, would bear a large <HI>Comment;</HI> but we mu&s;t ha&s;ten, and &s;hall only remark:</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That they Swear, <HI>Well and Truly</HI> (that is, <HI>Uprightly,</HI> and according to <HI>Law) to Serve the</HI> King, <HI>and his People.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> That they &s;hall do <HI>Equal Right, and Execution of Law, to all the</HI> King's <HI>Subjects, Rich and Poor;</HI> (that is, without <HI>Partiality, Favour, Malice,</HI> &amp;c.) <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> is Pictured <HI>Blind</HI> in re&s;pect of the <HI>Subject,</HI> not the <HI>Object:</HI> She has a <HI>Ballance,</HI> not to weigh <HI>Gold,</HI> but the <HI>Crime:</HI> She has regard to <HI>Offences,</HI> not <HI>Per&s;ons.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> That if any <HI>Letters from the King</HI> (unduly obtain'd, for &s;o all &s;uch are &s;uppo&s;ed to be) &s;hall be brought to them, <HI>contrary to Law,</HI> they are not to

regard them; much le&s;s are they to value any <HI>Verbal</HI> Commands, or little <HI>Ras|kally In&s;inuations</HI> of any <HI>Court Favourites,</HI> hu&s;&s;ing <HI>Grandeos,</HI> or &s;mall <HI>Minions</HI> of State.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> That by this their <HI>Oath, Judges</HI> are to proceed according to <HI>Law;</HI> their Bu&s;ine&s;s is <HI>Jus Dicere,</HI> to Declare and Admini&s;ter the Laws E&s;tabli&s;h'd; not <HI>Jus Dare,</HI> to Impo&s;e their own Whim&s;ical, Arbitrary, <HI>Peevi&s;h,</HI> or Self-de|&s;igning Opinions, for <HI>Law;</HI> or to U&s;urp a <HI>Legi&s;lative</HI> Power, &s;o as deliver that to be Law, which in truth is not &s;o. And if they &s;hall pre&s;ume to offend here|in, they are <HI>Exemplarily</HI> to be puni&s;hed: For &s;ince 'tis a known <HI>Maxim</HI> of Law, <HI>Ignorantia Juris non excu&s;at, That Ignorance of the Law &s;hall ex|cu&s;e no Man;</HI> (The Rea&s;on of which, is, becau&s;e every Man a &s;uppo&s;ed to be <HI>Privy,</HI> and con&s;enting to all our Laws, by his <HI>Repre&s;entatives</HI> in <HI>Par|liament.)</HI> How much le&s;s are <HI>Judges</HI> (who&s;e <HI>Profe&s;&s;ion</HI> and <HI>Office</HI> it is to Under&s;tand the Law; and therefore, mu&s;t take Notice of it, at their <HI>Peril</HI>) to be Indulg'd? Under what Character will they plead Excu&s;e? Are they Per&s;ons of known <HI>Learning,</HI> and &s;trong <HI>Natural Parts,</HI> great <HI>Reading,</HI> exqui&s;ite <HI>Eloquence, &amp;c</HI>? All this but <HI>aggravates</HI> their Fault, that they &s;hould abu&s;e &s;uch good Gifts, to the Di&s;honour of the <HI>King</HI> that Commi&s;&s;ions them, and Prejudice of His <HI>People</HI> that expected more exact Dealings from &s;uch E|minent Accompli&s;hments. Will they &s;helter them&s;elves under the before-mentioned <HI>Plea</HI> of <HI>Ignorance</HI>? This is already &s;hewn to be an Invalid Alle|gation; and be&s;ides, 'tis a Reflection on that <HI>Royal Power</HI> that Preferr'd them: And, What infinite Mi&s;chiefs (of which there is no Particular <HI>Complaint</HI> or <HI>Information</HI>) may the Subjects &s;uffer in their <HI>Lives,</HI> and <HI>Fortunes,</HI> under &s;uch <HI>Ignorance,</HI> which is always attended with Equal <HI>Pre&s;umption</HI>? Or, <HI>la&s;tly,</HI> Sup|po&s;e it &s;hould be offered in their Favour, That for &s;ome time, at fir&s;t, they were <HI>Upright,</HI> and have had the Reputation of Prudence and Integrity, in all Ca&s;es, except <HI>&s;uch</HI> and <HI>&s;uch:</HI> for which NOW they are que&s;tioned: To this it may be fitly An&s;wer'd, (as he of <HI>Lacedemon</HI> &s;aid of the <HI>Athenians</HI>) If they carryed them&s;elves <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll,</HI> when Time was, and now <HI>Ill,</HI> they de&s;erve a <HI>Double</HI> Puni&s;hment; becau&s;e they are not <HI>Good,</HI> as they <HI>were:</HI> and becau&s;e they are <HI>Evil,</HI> as they <HI>were not.</HI> The <HI>Judges,</HI> 'tis true, are declared in the <HI>Parliament-Roll</HI> of the 11 <HI>R.</HI> 2. to be <HI>Executors</HI> of the <HI>Statutes,</HI> Judgments, and Ordinances of <HI>Parliament:</HI> But they mu&s;t not make them&s;elves the <HI>Executioners</HI> of them too, by endeavouring the De&s;truction of the Fundamentals of our <HI>Laws</HI> and <HI>Liberties.</HI> The <HI>Law</HI> is the <HI>Temple,</HI> the <HI>Sanctuary,</HI> whither the Subject is to run for Shelter and Defence: But if the Judges, <HI>Sacerdotes Ju&s;titiae,</HI> tho&s;e <HI>Prie&s;ts of Ju&s;tice,</HI> &s;hall, like tho&s;e of <HI>Delphos,</HI> utter <HI>Fal&s;e, Ambiguous,</HI> and <HI>Time-Serving Oracles,</HI> Where is the Comfort of the Poor <HI>Votaries</HI>?

<P>In the Reign of King <HI>H.</HI> 4 His Son and Heir apparent (then a <HI>Wild Youth,</HI> but afterwards as Solid, and Renowned a King, as mo&s;t that have &s;way'd the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Scepter) hearing that one of his Companions was Arraigned for Felony before the Lord Chief Ju&s;tice of <HI>England</HI> (I am &s;orry my narrow Reading has not brought me acquainted with his Honourable Name) came to the Bar, and offered to take away the <HI>Pri&s;oner</HI> by force; but being with&s;tood by the &s;aid Chief Ju&s;tice, &s;tepped to him, and <HI>Struck</HI> him over the Face; whereat the Judge nothing daunted, ro&s;e up, and with a <HI>Gravity</HI> becoming his Dignity, told him, That he did not this Affront to <HI>Him,</HI> but to the King his <HI>Father,</HI> in who&s;e Place he &s;ate; and therefore, forthwith Committed him to Pri&s;on. The Prince <HI>Over-aw'd</HI> with the Maje&s;ty of the <HI>Sage Judge</HI>'s Expre&s;&s;ions, calmly Suffered him&s;elf to be carried away by an ordinary <HI>Tip-Staff;</HI> which being told the King, He not a little Rejoyced, both that he had a <HI>Judge</HI> of &s;uch Coura|gious Integrity; and a <HI>Son</HI> of &s;uch Submi&s;&s;ive Obedience to his Laws, <HI>Vide Baker fol.</HI> 163.</P>
<P>The Famous Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> having required a <HI>Charge</HI> upon divers of Her Subjects, by particular Letters from the Lords of Her Council, of &s;everal <HI>Sums</HI> of Money, for pre&s;ent Aid towards Her Wars in <HI>Ireland;</HI> hearing that one of Her <HI>Judges,</HI> viz, Mr. Ju&s;tice <HI>Walme&s;ley,</HI> being conven'd before the &s;aid Lords, for Non Payment thereof, thereby Di&s;couraging others; had An&s;wered, That it was <HI>Contrary to Law</HI> that the &s;ame &s;hould be Impo&s;ed, there being an Expre&s;s <HI>Statute</HI> again&s;t it; which He being a <HI>Judge,</HI> was bound by his Oath, to &s;ignifie to Her Maje&s;ty, he being (as much as in him lay) a Con&s;ervator of the <HI>Queens Oath</HI> in that behalf; Her Maje&s;ty was much Offended, that any &s;uch Impo&s;ition had been pretended to, and Commanded that it &s;hould be &s;topped from further <HI>Gathering;</HI> and to &s;uch as had paid it, their Money, by Her expre&s;s Order, was <HI>Re&s;tored. Judge Crooks Argument</HI> in <HI>Hampden's Ca&s;e,</HI> p. 57.</P>
<P>In the 29th. of the &s;ame Queen, Her Maje&s;ty having Erected a New-Office in the <HI>Common Pleas,</HI> for making of <HI>Super&s;edeas</HI> on <HI>Exigents,</HI> She Grants it to one <HI>Cavendi&s;h</HI> Her Servant; &s;ends to have him admitted, but the Judges delay the doing thereof, On this Rea&s;on, becau&s;e the <HI>Prothonotaries,</HI> and <HI>Philizers</HI> Claimed the making tho&s;e Writs. The Queen &s;ends a <HI>Sharp</HI> Letter, and Com|mands them forthwith to Admit him: Then She &s;ends a more po&s;itive Com|mand, requiring the Rea&s;on of their <HI>Contempt</HI> and Di&s;obedience. The Judges return the beforementioned Rea&s;on to the Lord <HI>Keeper,</HI> and Earl of <HI>Leice&s;ter</HI>
<PB N="27" REF="040005_0031_1015BEFCCD010678">
(no mean Man in tho&s;e Days) upon which, the Queen &s;ends a <HI>Fourth Pe|remptory</HI> Me&s;&s;age for their Admitting him, with this Rea&s;on: That if the o|thers were put out, they were <HI>Rich,</HI> and Able Men, and that Her Courts of Ju&s;tice were <HI>Open,</HI> where they might Demand their Right; for this was not to debar them <HI>Therefrom,</HI> but only to put them to their <HI>Action.</HI> The <HI>Hone&s;t Judges</HI> returned this An&s;wer, That the Queen had taken Her <HI>Oath,</HI> for the due Execution of Ju&s;tice <HI>According to Law,</HI> and they did not doubt, but when Her Maje&s;ty was Informed it was again&s;t the Law, She would Act therein as be|came her. For their own parts, they had taken an <HI>Oath</HI> to <HI>God,</HI> to <HI>Her,</HI> and the COMMON-WEALTH; And if they &s;hould do it without <HI>Proce&s;s</HI> of Law before them, and only upon Her Command put the others out of Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, though the Right remained to them, it were a Breach of their <HI>Oath;</HI> and there|fore, if the Fear of <HI>God</HI> were not Sufficient, they told Her the Puni&s;hment, that was Inflicted upon their <HI>Predece&s;&s;ors</HI> for Breach of their Oaths (citing <HI>Thorpe,</HI> &amp;c) might be a &s;ufficient <HI>Warning</HI> to them: Whereupon the Queen hearing the&s;e Rea&s;ons, was Satisfied; and the &s;aid Judges heard no more of this Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>To De&s;cend nearer our own Times, we cannot omit that grand Example of <HI>Uprightne&s;s,</HI> the ever Famous Sir <HI>Matthew Hale,</HI> late Lord Chief Ju&s;tice of the King's-Bench; a <HI>Miracle</HI> for all other parts of <HI>Polite</HI> and <HI>Serious</HI> Learning, as well as profound knowledge in the <HI>Laws</HI> of <HI>England.</HI> Of whom I &s;hall yet, not offer any particular <HI>In&s;tances,</HI> &s;ince his whole Life was one continued Thread of <HI>Sincere, and Under&s;tanding Ju&s;tice:</HI> For as ea&s;ily you might have ju&s;tled the <HI>Sun</HI> out of the <HI>Ecliptick,</HI> as to have warp'd him from his con&s;tant Road of <HI>In|tegrity.</HI> An exact <HI>Standard</HI> whereby <HI>Future Princes</HI> may mea&s;ure the Quali|fications of their <HI>Judges;</HI> for though he were a mo&s;t <HI>Loyal,</HI> and Zealous Servant to the <HI>Crown;</HI> yet he was &s;o far from being ever <HI>Impeached</HI> by the <HI>Repre&s;en|tative Body</HI> of the Nation, that no one <HI>Single</HI> Per&s;on (no not of tho&s;e that were <HI>Ca&s;t</HI> before him) were ever heard to complain of his Conduct.</P>
<P>And if any <HI>Latter</HI> Judges have been di&s;mis'd by fal&s;e Tales of Sycophant <HI>Whi&s;perers,</HI> or for oppo&s;ing ba&s;e <HI>Illegal Arbitrary Intere&s;ts;</HI> as they have the Invaluable Satisfaction of a good <HI>Con&s;cience</HI> for their Comfort; &s;o they may be a&s;&s;ured, they &s;till appear more Glorious in the Eyes of all good <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men at pre&s;ent, and will be Recorded more Venerable to Po&s;terity, than any <HI>Robes</HI> or Preferment, &s;ullied with <HI>Bribery, Flattery,</HI> or <HI>Treacherous</HI> Compli|ances, could render them.</P>
<P>However, we hope the <HI>Various Examples,</HI> we have here Enumerated from Authentick <HI>Records,</HI> and <HI>Hi&s;tories,</HI> may be &s;ufficient to Deter future <HI>Judges</HI> from Ill Cour&s;es; and &s;atisfie all the World, both in the <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> of the Parlia|ments late Proceedings in this Ca&s;e, and the <HI>Rea&s;onablene&s;s</HI> of their <HI>Vote</HI> and intended <HI>Bill,</HI> That <HI>Judges</HI> henceforth &s;hould hold their Places, and Salaries, not <HI>Ad Placitum,</HI> but <HI>Quam Diu &s;e bene ge&s;&s;erint.</HI> Which was the principal Aim of the&s;e Papers. <HI>Fiat Ju&s;titia.</HI></P>
