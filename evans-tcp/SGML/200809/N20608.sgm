<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>READER, you have now before you, &s;ome account of the Life and Death of one, who&s;e eminent piety entitled her to, and obtained her the e&s;teem of all the real lovers of virtue in the circle of her acquaintance.</P>
<P>Had her character as a Chri&s;tian in <HI>life,</HI> and the circum&s;tances attending her <HI>death,</HI> been as uni|ver&s;ally known as they were worthy of admira|tion, it would have precluded the nece&s;&s;ity of this publication; but as this was not the ca&s;e, it was thought by &s;ome of her religious acquaintance, that <HI>a &s;hort account</HI> thereof, &s;ent into the world, might be of real &s;ervice to the enlightened, but too thoughtle&s;s and &s;ecure inhabitants of Ame|rica.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="027054_0005_0FD37FDE60302C60">But in the execution of this a con&s;iderable dif|ficulty has ari&s;en: no minute being made of her expre&s;&s;ions and behavior 'till immediately after her death, many pa&s;&s;ages, (though highly inter|e&s;ting) are obliged to be omitted, on account of their being &s;o imperfectly remembered by tho&s;e who were pre&s;ent when &s;uch occurrences hap|pened, that they could not again repeat them with &s;uch per&s;picuity and accuracy as the nature of the ca&s;e required.</P>
<P>Of the reality of the following account, there are a number of living witne&s;&s;es; who moreover feel a plea&s;ure in declaring, that &s;uch an in&s;tance of triumphant <HI>faith</HI> and patient <HI>re&s;ignation,</HI> they never before &s;aw in all their lives.</P>
<P>One remarkable in&s;tance of her entire re&s;igna|tion is contained in the following circum&s;tance; which being omitted in the following account, will be the more acceptable here.&mdash;One of her brothers (Bennett Maxey) being an itenerant mini&s;ter in the Methodi&s;t Epi&s;copal Church, was travelling and preaching the Go&s;pel at a con&s;ider|able di&s;tance from home.</P>
<P>It is extremely natural for tho&s;e who are leav|ing the world to wi&s;h to &s;ee their friends, and e&s;pe|cially tho&s;e whom they peculiarly e&s;teem. But when &s;he was a&s;ked, whether &s;he would have him &s;ent for, &s;he &s;aid &s;he wi&s;hed to &s;ee him; but as he
<PB N="vii" REF="027054_0006_0FD37FDFCB838280">
was engaged in his Ma&s;ter's work, &s;he did not wi&s;h to hinder him; but reque&s;ted them to tell him to redeem time, and try to meet her in Hea|ven. And no doubt but the hope &s;he had that they &s;hould meet again at the re&s;urrection of the ju&s;t, enabled her to give up all hope of &s;eeing him again in time. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Her brother, on receiving an account of her death, writes in the following words; which being &s;trongly expre&s;&s;ive of their love and union, and of the impre&s;&s;i|on made on his mind by her pious exhortations to re|deem time, &amp;c. are here tran&s;cribed.
<Q>When I left my <HI>dear &s;i&s;ter</HI> I was in great hopes I &s;hould have &s;een her again in time, but am di&s;appointed; and there|fore think I will take her good advice, and redeem all the time I can.&mdash;Time is precious, and my poor heart is too backward to redeem time; but God being my helper, I feel more than ever re&s;olved to do his ble&s;&s;ed will.&mdash;When I think of the love and union there were between us, I hardly know how to give her up. The pain of parting is great; but I expect the joy will be greater if ever we meet again. So I find a re&s;ignation to the will of God.</Q></NOTE></P>
<P>The reader will ob&s;erve, in the cour&s;e of the following pages, a very remarkable circum&s;tance She had labored for &s;ome time under a mo&s;t pow|erful temptation; but was at length wonderfully and &s;trangely delivered by a remarkable dream; in which a &s;mall ticket appeared to be providen|tially conveyed to her, containing the&s;e words of the apo&s;tle John&mdash;"Beloved, now are we the &s;ons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we &s;hall
<PB N="viii" REF="027054_0007_0FD37FE1FA890028">
be; but we know that when he &s;hall appear, we &s;hall be like him, for we &s;hall &s;ee him as he is." The&s;e words proved &s;uch a &s;ource of comfort to her both at the time and afterwards, that &s;he de|&s;ired and reque&s;ted that they might be made the &s;ubject of her funeral di&s;cour&s;e. She had at the &s;ame time, &s;uch ju&s;t conceptions of the <HI>value</HI> of <HI>time,</HI> that &s;he al&s;o reque&s;ted a &s;ermon on that &s;ub|ject might be preached to tho&s;e that &s;hould at|tend her funeral. Accordingly at the time ap|pointed, two eminent mini&s;ters of God's word, (whom &s;he her&s;elf had nominated Mr. James O'Kelly, and Mr. Philip Gatch) &s;olemnized her funeral, in the pre&s;ence of a va&s;t concour&s;e of people. The one of them preached from the words &s;he had cho&s;en; and the other from Rev. x. 5, 6.
<Q>And the angel which I &s;aw &s;tand up|on the &s;ea, and upon the earth, lifted up his hand to Heaven, and &s;ware by him that liveth for ever and ever, that there &s;hould be time no longer.</Q></P>
<P>The attentive multitude behaved with great &s;e|riou&s;ne&s;s and &s;olemnity. But when her &s;ilent re|mains were con&s;igned to its mother du&s;t, there to re&s;t till the trumpet awakes the dead;&mdash;then in an e&s;pecial manner, the peculiar &s;olemnity of the &s;cene exceeded de&s;cription.</P>

<HEAD>A Short Account OF THE <HI>LIFE AND DEATH</HI> OF THEODOSIA MAXEY.</HEAD>
<P>THEODOSIA MAXEY, the daughter of John and Mary-Anne Maxey, was born in Powhatan County, in the State of Vir|ginia, on the thirteenth day of June, in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and &s;ixty-&s;ix. She was remarkable from her very infancy, for her uncommon obedience to her parents, and becom|ing deportment to the re&s;t of the family; and on all occa&s;ions, manife&s;ted a mild, gentle, and peace|able di&s;po&s;ition. But as &s;he grew up to maturity, (as it commonly happens) the corruptions of na|ture grew al&s;o. And although &s;he was ever pre|&s;erved from tho&s;e wicked practices that are com|mon to youth, yet the cu&s;toms and vanities of the
<PB N="12" REF="027054_0010_0FD37FE737D63C38">
world, &s;o far led her heart a&s;tray from God, as to make her carele&s;s and indifferent about the &s;alva|tion of her &s;oul. It is, however, but ju&s;tice to ob&s;erve, that very few, while in an unregenerate &s;tate, pre&s;erve a character &s;o amiable, and a life &s;o free from vice.</P>
<P>For &s;ome time &s;he did not appear to have had any other awakenings, than tho&s;e of an enlightened con&s;cience; nor any other convictions, than tho&s;e which nece&s;&s;arily ari&s;e from the enlightening beams of "That true light which lighteneth every man that cometh into the world"&mdash;&s;o that there appeared nothing remarkable in her religi|ous exerci&s;es, till about the 18th year of her age.</P>
<P>About the year 1775, &s;he began to hear the Methodi&s;ts preach. Edward Dromgoole, Jo&s;eph Hartley, Philip Gatch, and others who &s;ucceeded them, preached the Go&s;pel through tho&s;e parts, with con&s;iderable &s;ucce&s;s. Her parents were &s;ome of the fir&s;t that were converted to God in that neighbourhood. Their hou&s;e was opened for the reception of Methodi&s;t preaching, where it has been regularly continued ever &s;ince. This circum&s;tance tended greatly to increa&s;e her oppor|tunities of in&s;truction; for be&s;ide hearing frequent|ly the word of God in public, &s;he had al&s;o the ad|vantage
<PB N="13" REF="027054_0011_0FD37FE8B3B7E610">
of being much in the company of tho&s;e worthy characters who preached it, and of hear|ing their private in&s;tructions: a priviledge for which many will have cau&s;e eternally to ble&s;s God.</P>
<P>Nothing however, of a religious nature, &s;eems to have made any la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ion on her mind, till about the beginning of the year 1785. It was then that Mr. <HI>J. Major,</HI> after preaching at her father's, earne&s;tly intreated her to "try and &s;ave her &s;oul;" and after &s;ome other plain and pointed conver&s;ation took his leave of her with &s;aying, "If you peri&s;h your blood will be upon your own head." The&s;e words (which carried convictions with them) appeared to be &s;poken with great &s;implicity and godly &s;incerity: and a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of their truth with a fear of their being dreadfully verified, deeply affected her, and created &s;uch an alarm in her con&s;cience, that thence forward &s;he could not re&s;t till the Lord &s;pake peace to her &s;oul.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of the convictions &s;he now re|ceived, her mind became very re&s;ile&s;s and unea&s;y. A firm per&s;ua&s;ion that &s;he was a &s;inner again&s;t God;&mdash;An awful apprehen&s;ion of his ju&s;t di&s;plea|&s;ure; and a hope that there was yet mercy for
<PB N="14" REF="027054_0012_0FD37FEAF0C4D530">
her, fixed in her a determination to take the preacher's advice, and try to &s;ave her &s;oul.</P>
<P>We do not intend to give a particular account of the whole progre&s;s of her convictions from this time. There were &s;ome circum&s;tances, however, which had a powerful tendency to deepen and increa&s;e tho&s;e convictions; a brief account of which, will, we tru&s;t, be plea&s;ing, in&s;tructive, and entertaining to the reader.</P>
<P>Religion, about this time, was at a very low ebb. Many of tho&s;e who embraced it, &s;ome years before, were now called from this to a better world.&mdash;The preaching of the Go&s;pel had appa|rently very little effect:&mdash;The then ri&s;ing gene|ration were thoughtle&s;s and prophane;&mdash;and though many attended the preaching of the word, yet the &s;eed &s;own fell mo&s;tly by the <HI>way &s;ide,</HI> and but few brought forth fruit to perfection, and adorned the profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity. Such was the State of things, when God, jealous for his own Glory, was plea&s;ed to revive his work in the following manner.</P>
<P>Eli&s;ha Maxey (a brother of Theodo&s;ia) in the month of <HI>June</HI> 1785, was powerfully awakened and converted to God. He was one evening
<PB N="15" REF="027054_0013_0FD37FEC79FDAC30">
importuned by his father to pray in the family: for a few moments he he&s;itated; but ca&s;ting his care on God, he began the fir&s;t public prayer he ever offered to a throne of grace. He had utte|red but few words, when the Spirit and power of God, was di&s;played in a very extraordinary manner. Deep convictions &s;eized &s;everal of the family, who till then had remained carele&s;s and unconcerned; but were now con&s;trained to cry out aloud for mercy. <HI>Theodo&s;ia</HI> was then pre&s;ent, and &s;unk to the floor under the powerful opera|tions of the &s;pirit of God. Her &s;trong cries and tears, plainly di&s;covered the agonies of her wounded &s;oul; and her convictions from that time appeared to be greatly deepened.</P>
<P>That a gracious work was now begun, and hap|pily going on, in Mr. Maxey's family, was now very evident. Seriou&s;ne&s;s and &s;olemnity marked their countenances, while &s;ighs and groans fre|quently bur&s;t from their di&s;con&s;olate hearts; and the very breathing of their &s;ouls appeared to be after God; and, "What &s;hall I do to be &s;aved?" was the important que&s;tion. As they were thus earne&s;tly inquiring the way to Zion, <HI>Eli&s;ha</HI> (the young man above mentioned) did all in his pow|er to point them to Chri&s;t, as being both able and willing to &s;ave; and his labours are not in
<PB N="16" REF="027054_0014_0FD37FEDFA945A68">
vain. <HI>Prayer-meetings</HI> were in&s;tituted, and the work began to &s;pread far and wide like fire among dry &s;tubble. Numbers attended the prayer meet|ings: preaching al&s;o was wonderfully ble&s;t: con|victions were frequent, deep, and la&s;ting; and it was not uncommon to &s;ee &s;everal &s;ouls converted at a common prayer-meeting. The work &s;oon &s;pread into other neighbourhoods and counties, yea into di&s;tant parts; till at length great part of the &s;tate &s;eemed to catch the &s;acred flame, &s;o that hun|dreds in a &s;hort time were brought to enjoy the favour and love of God.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From this beginning the work &s;oon after &s;pread through Virginia and the &s;outhern &s;tates, like a migh|ty torrent bearing down all before it.&mdash;When we re|flect bow this work began &mdash;the in&s;truments employ|ed in carrying it on,&mdash;and its progre&s;s in &s;pite of all oppo&s;ition &mdash;we are con&s;trained to &s;ay "This was the Lords doing and it is marvellous in our eyes.</NOTE></P>
<P>But the great and good effect, which the&s;e things had on Mr. Maxey's family, (and Theodo|&s;ia in particular) is what principally demands our ob&s;ervations at pre&s;ent. She continued for &s;ome time truly and heartily engaged with God. Her &s;ighs, tears and &s;ecret groans, were an inconte&s;ti|ble proof that &s;he was hungering and thir&s;ting after righteou&s;ne&s;s: but unbelief kept her from laying hold on the promi&s;e. In this di&s;tre&s;&s;ed
<PB N="17" REF="027054_0015_0FD37FEFC704A950">
&s;tate, &s;he went mourning from day to day, without comfort, without peace, and &s;ometimes almo&s;t without hope!</P>
<P>But God who wounds with an intent to heal, dropt a cordial into her bitter cup. Her mind was deeply impre&s;&s;ed with tho&s;e encouraging, and &s;oul refre&s;hing words of our Lord, (Matt. xi. 28.) "Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you re&s;t." The&s;e words gave her &s;ome ea&s;e of mind, and were the ground of a hope, that God would in his own good time, give her the re&s;t &s;he &s;o greatly de|&s;ired.</P>
<P>During this her great di&s;tre&s;s, &s;he &s;pent much of her time in private retirement, &s;earching the &s;criptures and wre&s;tling with God in prayer. Having on a certain time retired into a private room for tho&s;e purpo&s;es, &s;he chanced to read the pa&s;&s;age above mentioned. After pondering for &s;ome time on the words, &s;he withdrew, leaving the book open at the place. Ju&s;t about that time Mr. D&mdash; had an appointment to preach at her father's; and having occa&s;ion to go into the &s;ame room, found the book in the po&s;ture &s;he had left it. On looking therein he was at once &s;truck with a view of the words, and a &s;en&s;e of their
<PB N="18" REF="027054_0016_0FD37FF4C78EFB78">
importance; and after a few minutes' meditation therein, made them the &s;ubject of his di&s;cour&s;e that day in public. The word was applied to her heart, her hopes were &s;trengthened, her de&s;ires increa&s;ed, and &s;he appeared more re&s;olutely deter|mined to per&s;evere in &s;eeking the fulfilment of the promi&s;e to her &s;oul.</P>
<P>But finding at length, that notwith&s;tanding all her endeavours, her prayers, tears &amp;c. &s;he (like one of old) was nothing mended, but rather grew wor&s;e, &s;he determined to add <HI>fa&s;ting</HI> to the other means of grace. This &s;he found recom|mended both by precept and example in Scrip|ture; and by tho&s;e now whom &s;he had rea&s;on to believe were the real children and lovers of God. Hoping therefore to find &s;ome relief from this, &s;he entered upon it without delay: But &s;he &s;oon found this was not the help &s;he needed. At length after making every &s;hift, and u&s;ing every means in her power, &s;he became fully convinced,
<Q><L>"The blood of Chri&s;t mu&s;t &s;till remain,</L>
<L>"Sufficient and alone."</L></Q></P>
<P>In&s;tead therefore of getting relieved of her bur|den, it &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">d daily to increa&s;e. Being thus beaten out of all dependence on means, &s;he was at la&s;t experimentally taught the important le&s;&s;on
<PB N="19" REF="027054_0017_0FD37FF6AD12BA10">
&s;he had been &s;o long &s;triving to learn; and gi|ving up every plea, came to Chri&s;t, as "a weary, heavy laden &s;inner." She had long labored as in midnight darkne&s;s, and drank the wormwood and the gall: her &s;ins for &s;ome time had pre&s;&s;ed heavily upon her; but now unbelief, like a moun|tain &s;eemed to cru&s;h her down: In this di&s;tre&s;s and bitterne&s;s of &s;oul &s;he attended the prayer meeting,
<Q><L>"Burden'd with a world of grief,</L>
<L>"Burden'd with a &s;inful load,</L>
<L>"Burden'd with this unbelief,</L>
<L>"Burden'd with the wrath of GOD."</L></Q>
But her extremity was God's opportunity. At this prayer meeting &s;he was enabled to act faith; the chains and fetters of unbelief dropped off, and her &s;oul bur&s;t into the liberty of the chidren of God: Her &s;orrow and di&s;tre&s;s vani&s;hed in a mo|ment, and joy and peace took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her heart. Her mouth was filled with prai&s;es, and her tongue loo&s;ed to tell what God had done for her &s;oul. Old things were done away, and all things became new, and a new &s;ong put into her mouth, even prai&s;e to God.</P>
<P>Indeed the prai&s;es of God were now her daily employ, and &s;he never appeared happier than when engaged in this heavenly exerci&s;e. She
<PB N="20" REF="027054_0018_0FD37FF979D688A8">
frequently &s;ang with tran&s;port the following words,
<Q><L>"Now I'll &s;ing of Je&s;u's merit,</L>
<L>"Tell the world of his dear name;</L>
<L>"That if any want his Spirit,</L>
<L>"Je&s;us is the very &s;ame;</L>
<L>"He that a&s;keth &s;oon receiveth;</L>
<L>"He that &s;eeks is &s;ure to find;</L>
<L>"Come&mdash;for who&s;oe'er believeth,</L>
<L>"He will never ca&s;t behind."</L></Q></P>
<P>In this happy frame &s;he continued for &s;ome+time, a living witne&s;s that "God has power on earth to forgive &s;in." And the happine&s;s &s;he found in religion during this period, appeared too great for words to de&s;cribe: &s;he &s;eems to have con&s;oled her&s;elf with the plea&s;ing (though delu|&s;ive hope, that her enemies were all de&s;troyed, and &s;he &s;hould learn war no more. But experi|ence &s;oon taught her otherwi&s;e, and the corrup|tions of nature with the temptations of the Devil, convinced her of her mi&s;take. Evil tempers and di&s;po&s;itions, the remains of the carnal mind, be|gan to &s;truggle for the a&s;cendency, and &s;he found her&s;elf &s;urrounded with enemies before &s;he was aware! By con&s;ulting her experience, &s;he found this was not a &s;tate of re&s;t, but of war and con|flict; and that &s;he con&s;equently needed the whole
<PB N="21" REF="027054_0019_0FD37FFAB1E0AD40">
armour of God; otherwi&s;e her enemies would prevail, and her latter end be wor&s;e than the beginning. While the&s;e con&s;iderations taught her the nece&s;&s;ity of a deeper work of grace, a conviction that it was her privilege, &s;et her to &s;eek|ing it. She found great encouragement from the&s;e, and the like portions of Scripture&mdash;"His name &s;hall be called Je&s;us, for he &s;hall &s;ave his people <HI>from</HI> their &s;ins:"&mdash;"that he was mani|fe&s;ted to <HI>de&s;troy the works of the Devil:</HI>" that he has promi&s;ed to "&s;anctify his people <HI>wholly,</HI> body and &s;oul and &s;pirit; and to pre&s;erve them <HI>blame|e&s;s</HI> unto life eternal:&mdash;and above all&mdash;"that he al&s;o is <HI>faithful</HI> who has promi&s;ed, who al&s;o <HI>will do it.</HI>" And as &s;he &s;ought the Lord for the pardon of her &s;ins, &s;o &s;he did for a de&s;truction of the car|nal mind with all her heart.</P>
<P>From Augu&s;t, 1785, till the 5th day of April, 1786, &s;he earne&s;tly and per&s;everingly &s;ought the Lord for this ble&s;&s;ing. Then it was that her prayers were heard and an&s;wered in a very ex|traordinary manner, before a number of witne&s;&s;|es; &s;ome of whom to the pre&s;ent day, retain a lively remembrance of that &s;olemn &s;cene. The &s;ervent agonizing manner in which &s;he wre&s;tled
<PB N="22" REF="027054_0020_0FD37FFC3B97F758">

Her mortal part, at length, unequal to the ta&s;k, &s;unk under the conflict, and remained for &s;ome time almo&s;t motionle&s;s; but the a&s;piring &s;oul would take no denial; till at length, like Jacob, &s;he became a prevailer. In a word, &s;uch an in&s;tance of active, per&s;evering and prevailing faith, we may venture to &s;ay is rarely to be met with.</P>
<P>From this time forward, &s;he appeared to dwell as in the &s;uburbs of Heaven, and lived a witne&s;s that even here, "the blood of Chri&s;t clean&s;eth from all &s;in." Her conduct and deportment was truly becoming the Chri&s;tian character, and the &s;ervice of God was her delight. She cheerfully &s;ubmitted to difficulties, cro&s;&s;es and di&s;appoint|ments, in order to attend the wor&s;hip of God, and the mini&s;try of his word: and &s;he u&s;ed to ex|pre&s;s her wonder and a&s;toni&s;hment that &s;o many who had an opportunity of hearing the word of God, would neverthele&s;s continue carele&s;s at home, and &s;pend that precious time in vanity that they might have &s;pent in the &s;ervice of God. This was far from being the ca&s;e with her, for &s;he would neglect no opportunity, but at all times appeared de&s;irous to wait on God in the u&s;e of all

<P>About two years before her departure, the &s;ymptoms of a con&s;umption were fir&s;t di&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters">rable. A dry tickling cough, the wearing away of the fle&s;h, a quick pul&s;e, &s;hortne&s;s of breath, &amp;c. &s;eemed to portend her approaching di&s;&s;olution. As her bo|dy weakened, and the di&s;order increa&s;ed, her &s;oul ripened apace, for the eternal reward. Relying on the word of him who has promi&s;ed, that "All things &s;hall work together for good to them that love God;" She did not appear to dread her ap|proaching change, but re&s;igned her&s;elf into the hands of God: and when &s;he was a&s;ked, if &s;he dreaded death? would reply, "I have a hope be|yond the grave!"</P>
<P>After a variety of means had been u&s;ed to check the di&s;order without the de&s;ired effect; &s;he was advi&s;ed about Augu&s;t 1792, to u&s;e the waters of a mineral &s;pring.

<P>While &s;he continued to u&s;e the waters above mentioned, &s;he thought &s;he found relief; but on her return home &s;he grew wor&s;e, and was confi|ned &s;oon after mo&s;tly to her bed.

<P>During the fall and beginning of winter, her di&s;order gained ground very fa&s;t, and her body weakened accordingly; in con&s;equence of which &s;he could &s;it up but little: Her cough al&s;o was very trouble&s;ome, and con&s;iderably di&s;turbed her re&s;t; but in&s;tead of murmuring at any of the di&s;|pen&s;ations of Providence, &s;he bore all her &s;uffer|ings with a chri&s;tian-like patience, and entire re|&s;ignation to the Divine will.</P>

<P>Friday, 22. She appeared to labour &s;till un|der the &s;ame di&s;tre&s;s. One a&s;ked her if &s;he was afraid of death? She replied, "I think at times I am not &s;o fearful of it as I ought to be."&mdash;From this it appears that her mind was in &s;ome degree beclouded, &s;o that &s;he dur&s;t not con&s;ider her&s;elf entitled to the great and precious promi&s;es made to the children of God. But he who permits the trial of his people, can, when it plea&s;es him, wonderfully and &s;trangely deliver them: An in|&s;tance of this we have <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> before us.

But the re&s;t</Q>
&s;aid &s;he "I cannot remember." She de&s;ired her brother to take the &s;criptures and &s;earch, and &s;ee of he could find &s;uch a pa&s;&s;age there. He pre&s;ently found it in 1 John iii. 2. The whole pa&s;&s;age is as followeth,

The words when read to her, &s;eemed to remove her fears; &s;he again took courage. Indeed it appears as if this was a &s;ingular providence of God to communicate comfort to this afflicted &s;aint, in this hour of dark|ne&s;s and di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Saturday 23. She &s;aid
<Q>Mamma, can you give me up?</Q>
Her mother &s;aid, "Yes my child, if it is the will of God!" She then a&s;ked for her father and put the &s;ame que&s;tion to him. She &s;aid,

She exhorted him to redeem time; "Precious time!" &s;aid &s;he; and de&s;ired him to tell her brothers to redeem time, and meet her in glory, for &s;he did not think he &s;hould &s;tay here long.</P>

She exhorted the children to be dutiful to their parents; and above all to try and &s;ave their &s;ouls.

<P>Monday, 25. Was nearly as the day be|fore.</P>
<P>Tue&s;day 26. She complained a little of her mouth and throat, which were very &s;ore.

<P>Wedne&s;day 27. The enemy of &s;ouls again thru&s;t &s;ore at her. She was now tempted to think &s;he had offended God by impatience; and &s;o powerful was this temptation that it de&s;troyed her peace, and brought her to the border of de&s;|pair. To one of her brothers who vi&s;ited her in this di&s;tre&s;s, &s;he &s;aid, "Brother, I have waded

through deep waters &s;ince I &s;aw you, and &s;till I fear I have not been enough re&s;igned to the will of God." He told her this was the travail of a chri&s;tian, and encouraged her to look to God for deliverance. He in&s;tanced the ca&s;e of David, who, when the waves and the billows went over him, cried out, "Why art thou ca&s;t down, O my &s;oul, and why art thou di&s;quieted within me? Hope thou in God for I &s;hall yet prai&s;e him." But &s;he could take no comfort from this, for the cloud &s;till hovered over her mind. In the even|ing many people came and offered their &s;ervice to &s;it up. She thanked them and &s;aid, "I hope the Lord will reward you for your kindne&s;s." And then intreated them in the mo&s;t endearing and affectionate manner to &s;eek the &s;alvation of their &s;ouls; "For if I &s;hould mi&s;s of heaven (&s;aid &s;he) I want you to get there." From this it appears that &s;he was not yet freed from the temp|tation above mentioned. Her great re&s;ignation when &s;o violently attacked by the devil is peculi|arly ob&s;ervable: For, when a&s;ked by one which &s;he would chu&s;e, life or death, &s;he &s;aid "I will chu&s;e neither; the will of the Lord be done."</P>

<P>About 12 or 1 o'clock the cloud was di&s;pelled, the darkne&s;s di&s;per&s;ed, her fears and doubts re|moved, and heavenly light re&s;tored. The &s;pirit of the Lord came upon her, his glory &s;hone round her, and heaven &s;prang up in her &s;oul. Her mourning was now turned into joy, her hea|vine&s;s into happine&s;s and her &s;orrow to &s;ongs of prai&s;e. She began to exhort the family, encou+raging and per&s;uading them to pre&s;s on, and &s;ecure their eternal happine&s;s. She told them of the goodne&s;s of God; and the more &s;he &s;pake of his goodne&s;s, the more of it &s;eemed poured down into her &s;oul, till all her powers &s;eemed lo&s;t in wonder, love and prai&s;e.</P>

Then turning to &s;ome of the neighbours who were pre&s;ent, intreated them to meet her in glory, and then bid them all an affectionate fare|well.</P>
<P>She then lay &s;till a while: but the nearer &s;he approached the heavenly Jeru&s;alem, the more lively and clear her views were, of the glory of the place. New di&s;coveries, and &s;till more glo|rious pro&s;pects, &s;eemed to open to her view; and her triumphant &s;oul appeared to want nothing but wings: Indeed &s;he &s;eemed in&s;en&s;ible of her great weakne&s;s, and with a &s;trength of voice that was truly a&s;ton&s;hing, cried out, "Je&s;us is come,

She would extend her arms and &s;ay, "The door of mercy is yet open! Come, come for yet there is room! and the Lord is willing to &s;ave your &s;ouls." Thus &s;he continued for a con&s;iderable length of time, rejoicing&mdash;prai&s;ing God&mdash;and exhorting the people.

She continued happy all the af|ternoon, but her bodily &s;trength failed; and &s;he lay &s;till calmly re&s;igned, and cheerfully &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to her fate.</P>

<P><PB N="39" REF="027054_0037_0FD38025995A5F28">Whoever con&s;iders the above words attentive|ly, cannot but ob&s;erve how peculiarly applicable they were. They appear to be the language of a &s;oul &s;tanding on the border of eternity, looking over the narrow &s;ea, death; and viewing, by faith, the glories of the place, of which the earthly Canaan was only a type. She appeared earne&s;tly to de&s;ire to drop the clay tenement, and and to be with Chri&s;t, which is far better.</P>
<P>After they had done &s;inging the hymn, &s;he continued rejoicing and talking of God's good|ne&s;s for &s;ome time, then dropped into a doze, and &s;lept calmly for about one hour; &s;he then awoke with a &s;hortne&s;s of breath, and frequent|ly &s;aid "Lord have Mercy on me." When a&s;k|ed what &s;he wanted, &s;he would &s;ay, "re&s;t." The pangs of death were now &s;trong upon her, but &s;he would frequently &s;ay,
<Q><L>"My &s;uffering time will &s;oon be o'er,</L>
<L>"When I &s;hall &s;igh and weep no more."</L></Q></P>
<P>Being a&s;ked by Mr. G&mdash;, how &s;he was? replied, "Happy in God, and entirely re&s;igned to his will." What a comfort it is, (&s;aid one) to have &s;uch an a&s;&s;urance! She &s;aid "Wonderful!, Wonderful!" One taking her leave of her &s;aid
<PB N="40" REF="027054_0038_0FD38026634ACE28">
"God ble&s;s you my child; if I never &s;ee you more on earth, I will try to meet you in heaven." She &s;aid "where parting will be no more," and &s;oon after &s;lept in Je&s;us, and her &s;pirit went to re&s;t, in the 27th year of her age.</P>
<P>Thus lived, and thus died that humble and de|vout follower of her Lord, a remarkable in&s;tance of faith and patience. But&mdash;O reader thou al|&s;o mu&s;t die! This dreadful debt thou mu&s;t &s;ure|ly pay! Art thou prepared, or art thou yet a &s;inner? Re&s;olve this que&s;tion before it is too late. Dreadful! horribly dreadful will it be to die without real religion! The many hard &s;trug|gles this young woman encountered will clearly evince, that death is no trifling thing! Then to prevent a mi&s;erable death, take her advice,&mdash; follow her example,&mdash;and &s;eek God with all your heart; So &s;hall you die the death of the righteous, and your la&s;t end &s;hall be like her's.</P>
