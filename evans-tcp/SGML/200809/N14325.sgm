<HEAD>A TESTIMONY from our Monthly Meeting at Wainfleet, in the County of Lincoln, concerning our decea&s;ed Friend WILLIAM RECKITT.</HEAD>
<P>THIS our worthy friend was born in the year 1706, within the compa&s;s of Gain&s;borough month|ly meeting, of parents profe&s;&s;ing truth, who died when he was young. His friends put him apprentice to a weaver belonging to the &s;ame monthly meeting, with whom we believe he &s;erved his time faithfully, and then came to live near Partney Mills, within the compa&s;s of our monthly meeting. After &s;ome time, about the year 1742, it plea&s;ed the Lord to call him into the work of the mini&s;try: his appearance from the fir&s;t was in the life and wi&s;dom of Truth, which nearly united him to his friends. Soon after he removed to Wainfleet particular meeting; and &s;ome time after he vi&s;ited friends in
<PB N="iv" REF="018146_0004_0FA56106388C8448">
the We&s;t of England, and Wales, &amp;c, and at different times many other coun|ties; al&s;o Ireland once with our friend Samuel Stott. He was twice in America: the fir&s;t time he &s;et forward in the year 1756, and, it being in the time of war, was taken pri&s;oner into France, and con|fined about &s;ix months, which he bore with Chri&s;tian fortitude (as &s;ome of us have heard him &s;ay) and got well home to his family in the beginning of the year 1757, where he &s;laid about four weeks, and then again &s;et forward for his intended vi&s;it. He afterward found a weighty concern to vi&s;it his friends in &s;ome part of America again; all which vi&s;its, by &s;undry accounts received, were much to friends &s;atisfaction, as well as his own: and indeed it may be truly &s;aid, he was deep in the mini&s;try, and power|ful in prayer, his te&s;timony found, and edifying, which rendered him very near, and valuable to many. He was grave in conver&s;ation, yet innocently cheerful among&s;t his friends; an affectionate hu&s;|band, and a tender parent. We think it needle&s;s to enlarge concerning him, as he was well known to many friends; only we may, with &s;incerity of heart, &s;ay, his removal is much regretted in general. In
<PB N="v" REF="018146_0005_0FA561071F120290">
the latter end of 1768, he had drawings in his mind to vi&s;it London, and parts adjacent; in which he told &s;ome of his near friends, he thought it might be the la&s;t time.</P>
<P>He returned home in the fir&s;t month, in the year 1769, but poorly in health, and continued &s;o; but mo&s;tly attended his own meeting, where he had &s;everal weighty te&s;timonies (which had more than u&s;ual influence over the hearers, leaving la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ions on their minds) as well as at times in private conver&s;ation, wherein he &s;ignified he was willing to leave all the&s;e tran&s;itory and fading en|joyments, whenever it might plea&s;e the Lord to call him from works to rewards.</P>
<P>His illne&s;s was very &s;hort; he was ta|ken with a fit of the ague the day before his departure, and next morning, about four o'clock, exchanged this life, we make no doubt, for a better, the &s;ixth of the fourth month 1769, and was buried the 9th of the &s;ame in friends burying ground at Wainfleet, after a &s;olemn meeting, where a living te&s;timony was borne to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e truth, and to the &s;atisfaction of many pre&s;ent.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>OUR late worthy friend WILLIAM RECKITT, who&s;e journal follows, was one whom the Lord was plea&s;ed to prepare for his &s;ervice; and having in a good degree experienced the work of righteou&s;ne&s;s to be peace, he was engag|ed, under the influence of divine love, to call to others to come, ta&s;te, and &s;ee that the Lord is good.</P>
<P>His life and conver&s;ation were inno|cent, and con&s;i&s;tent with his profe&s;&s;ion, and, in the exerci&s;e of his mini&s;try, he was attended with that love which &s;eeks the good of all.</P>
<P>As the following journal commences only with his voyage to America, a &s;hort account of him, of the work of truth on his mind, and of his &s;ervices before he embarked for America, &s;eems not im|proper.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="018146_0008_0FA561092A24D950">He was born at Lea, near Gain&s;borough, in Lincoln&s;hire, about the year 1706, of parents profe&s;&s;ing truth; his mother died when he was young, and his father being through infirmities rendered incapable of &s;upporting his children, he was bound by friends at nine years of age, until he ar|rived at twenty-one, as an apprentice to a weaver; which proved a laborious &s;er|vitude, his ma&s;ter being in low circum|&s;tances. In the cour&s;e of his &s;ervice his ma&s;ter let him out to harve&s;t work, in which employment his indu&s;try gained him the confidence of the farmer that employed him, who thought it unnece&s;|&s;ary to look alter him, &s;aying, <Q>William was a faithful &s;ervant;</Q> as he was to his ma&s;ter to the end of his apprentice&s;hip. During which time he was reached by a divine vi&s;itation, through the mini&s;try of a friend on a religious vi&s;it, whole te&s;ti|mony (as he has been heard to relate) clearly an&s;wered the witne&s;s of truth in his own heart, and fully confirmed him, that the principles of friends were con&s;o|nant with the Holy Scriptures; and he then thought there would be none &s;o void of under&s;tanding, as not to be convinced by the &s;ame powerful declaration of the true Chri&s;tian faith. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> left a la&s;ting im|pre&s;&s;ion on his mind; an hunger and

thir&s;t after righteou&s;ne&s;s were begotten in his &s;oul; and by a diligent attention to the dicta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es thereof, he experienced pre|&s;ervation from the many temptations, which unguarded youth are expo&s;ed to. About the eighteenth year of his age, the death of an only &s;i&s;ter, a virtuous young woman, who had been particularly kind to him, nearly affected him; and an only brother, by giving way to the vanities of the world, was drawn a&s;ide, and left the &s;ociety. The&s;e events impre&s;&s;ed his mind with deep &s;orrow and humiliation; but feeling the pre&s;erving hand of divine goodne&s;s manife&s;ted for his &s;upport, he was engaged to live near thereto, by which he was mercifully pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>Soon after the expiration of his appren|tice&s;hip, he removed into the compa&s;s of Wainfleet monthly meeting in Lincoln|&s;hire, where he followed the bu&s;ine&s;s of a weaver, and increa&s;ed in the e&s;teem of of his friends; being a man who labour|ed to be in reality what he profe&s;&s;ed. In the year 1731, he entered into the mar|riage &s;tate with Ellin Maw, a &s;ober and virtuous young woman, who was an af|fectionate wife to him, and tender mother to their children: he &s;urvived her, &s;he

dying during his ab&s;ence on his &s;econd vi&s;it to America.</P>
<P>About the thirty-&s;ixth year of his age, he fir&s;t appeared in the mini&s;try to the &s;atisfaction of friends, and laboured di|ligently in his own and &s;ome neighbouring meetings for the advancement of truth; and after &s;ome time, in company with Robert Kin&s;ley, he vi&s;ited the churches in E&s;&s;ex; and about the latter end of 1745, in company with the &s;ame friend, al&s;o vi&s;ited the city of London; and his &s;ervice in this vi&s;it is &s;till remembered by &s;ome with brotherly regard and affection.</P>
<P>In 1746, he vi&s;ited the We&s;t of En|gland, and part of Wales; and in 1752, in company with Samuel Stott of Ed|mund&s;bury, he vi&s;ited Ireland, to his own and friends comfort and &s;atisfaction, and returned home with peace of mind. In 1756, he vi&s;ited York&s;hire; &s;oon after which, in the cour&s;e of his religious la|bours, he found him&s;elf engaged to vi&s;it the churches in the American plantations, the en&s;uing account whereof will be&s;t inform the reader of his prog<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;s therein.</P>

<PB N="xi" REF="018146_0011_0FA5610E9F9C4900">
concerning this our decea&s;ed friend; but to &s;hew the reader, that &s;uch as believe in, and live near to, the divine principle of truth in their own hearts, convey an evidence to the minds of tho&s;e who be|hold them: for he being taken in his pa&s;|&s;age by a privateer (England being then at war with France) and carried into Mor|laix, was there detained in a painful &s;tate of captivity, yet was pre&s;erved in great quietne&s;s and re&s;ignation, to the admira|tion of &s;ome of the French inhabitants; one of whom, in a letter to a per&s;on re|&s;iding in London, mentioned his innoffen|&s;ive lamb-like behaviour, in terms of great re&s;pect, and when he was removed to Carhaix, recommended him to a per|&s;on of account, a member of the parlia|ment of Brittany, who likewi&s;e te&s;tified his regard to him. The kindne&s;s he re|ceived from the&s;e per&s;ons moderated his captivity, though he had many exerci&s;es there, which often brought him very low; yet, he found &s;upport and pre&s;ervation, as he acknowledged in his letters, in one of which, after having noted how he had been helped, and expre&s;&s;ing his care for his future pre&s;ervation, he &s;ays: <Q>My fears have all been concerning my&s;elf, for &s;urely I never &s;aw more of my own weakne&s;s, it hath indeed been a &s;earch|ing

time to me; and yet it &s;prings in my heart to &s;ay, If the Lord hath any delight in me, he will bring me &s;afe through all; he knows the integrity of my heart: I did not &s;et out in a for|ward &s;pirit, but in his coun&s;el, and in it at this time I &s;tand; he knows be&s;t what will be mo&s;t for his own honour. And as to what will become of this earthly tabernacle, it &s;eems to be the lea&s;t of my care, &s;o that I may fini&s;h my cour&s;e with joy.</Q></P>
<P>After being detained about five months, he was relea&s;ed through the kindne&s;s of a per&s;on in England, who, having receiv|ed very favourable impre&s;&s;ions of him through the French merchant before mentioned, recommended him to the &s;ecretary of the &s;ick and wounded office (they having the care of &s;uch as were pri&s;oners,) and after a &s;hort &s;tay at home, finding the engagement remain, he re|turned to London, attended the yearly meeting, and, with the concurrence of friends, proceeded on his voyage, of which the following is his own relation.</P>

<P>HAVING parted with &s;everal friends who accompanied me to Grave&s;end, the fifteenth of the tenth month 1756, I went on board the &s;hip Lydia, Jo&s;eph Riddell ma&s;ter. We had three pa&s;&s;engers be&s;ides my&s;elf, who &s;eemed to be very &s;ober men, and carried them&s;elves very loving to me, as likewi&s;e did all our common men; though I often reproved them for &s;wearing, and their
<PB N="14" REF="018146_0014_0FA561123602D3F8">
bad language to one another. The 20th we came into the Downs, but the wind not being fair, we lay there till the 22d, when the wind coming more favourable, we weighed anchor.</P>
<P>It may not be ami&s;s to mention the great exerci&s;e and weight that re&s;ted upon my &s;pirit while we lay here, I then not &s;eeing the cau&s;e of it. When I looked forward, I could &s;ee little further than the Land's End, and I cried in my mind that we might be carried, or driven to Ireland; for then I thought I &s;hould get &s;afe to my journey's end: but not &s;eeing it would be &s;o then, I only de&s;ired we might put into Plymouth, which I men|tioned to the captain, and he told me, he thought he would. But the wind com|ing fair, and a &s;trong gale, he was will|ing to make the be&s;t of it. We out&s;ail|ed two &s;hips which came from the Downs with us, one a privateer called the St. Olive, from London; the other a Gui|neaman. The 24th, about ten in the morning, we came abrea&s;t of Plymouth, with a very fine wind. In the evening, as I &s;at in the cabin, &s;omething opened in my mind concerning my own pre&s;er|vation, which I thought &s;omewhat &s;trange; but &s;oon &s;aw a cau&s;e for it. For about eight o'clock next morning,
<PB N="15" REF="018146_0015_0FA56112F519AC78">
the mate came down and told his ma&s;ter, there was a French &s;now ju&s;t a&s;tern of us, which, to our &s;orrow, was too true, for &s;he was then within reach of us with her guns. I thought it was a great neglect of our ma&s;ter, and the &s;ailors, that they did not keep a &s;trict look-out; for they acknowledged, if they had but had a few hours more, they &s;hould not have been taken. But then it was too late, they could not get their &s;ails all properly bent, as they would have done, if due precau|tion had been taken. The &s;hot coming over us, I was afraid for our men.</P>
<P>During the little time we were cha&s;ed, the chief care our captain &s;eemed to take, was to &s;ave what he had, &s;o he kept pret|ty much in the cabin, till his men called very earne&s;tly for him to come upon deck. Then he ordered them to &s;trike, and in a little time the Frenchmen came and board+ed us with great fury. I was in the cabin, and &s;tood &s;till, &s;ome of them looking at me very &s;our and fierce, but like &s;o many hungry animals, they fell to hunting and &s;earching for what they could find, till they dur&s;t not &s;tay much longer. One of them coming to me, in a fawning manner, &s;aid, Sir, I de&s;ire you would give me your money, and watch, and I will give you them again. I told him I
<PB N="16" REF="018146_0016_0FA56113E6881708">
had not much, and did not chu&s;e to part with it. But he growing very earne&s;t to have it, I turned my&s;elf about, and took three guineas out of my pur&s;e, two of which I carried on &s;hore, and gave him the remainder. He looked at it, and &s;eemed not &s;atisfied; but the officers be|ing in ha&s;te to get us all into the boat, I was had upon deck. When I looked at the &s;ea, I thought it &s;eemed as though I &s;hould not e&s;cape with my life; therefore re&s;olved to &s;tay on board our ve&s;&s;el, if I might, and went down again into the cabin; but in a little time was fetched out, and commanded to get into the boat. The fear of death was then taken away, and I was re&s;olved to do the be&s;t I could to get in. One of our &s;ailors handed me a rope, but it was &s;o &s;hort, I was forced to let go, not knowing whe|ther I &s;hould fall into the &s;ea, or boat; for the &s;ea ran very high, and two of our men were lo&s;t during the &s;hort time I had been below. They were getting into the boat when I was &s;eized with fear, and I &s;aw it was not groundle&s;s; for had I then proceeded to get in, I &s;hould in all pro|bability have been drowned. For as &s;oon as I had turned my back to go down into the cabin, the gunwale of the &s;hip took the boat &s;ide, and had like to have &s;unk
<PB N="17" REF="018146_0017_0FA561146DD27418">
her, and the two poor men were ca&s;t out, the lo&s;s of whom &s;orrowfully affected my mind; and the imminent danger I had been in, with a &s;en&s;e of the Lord's good|ne&s;s and mercy in pre&s;erving me at that time, brought me very low, in humble thankfulne&s;s for &s;o great a deliverance, looking upon it as a mark of his tender care and fatherly regard for &s;o poor a creature as I am.</P>
<P>When we came up to the French &s;hip, our men a&s;&s;i&s;ted me in getting on board, and led me through a crowd of &s;uch creatures, as I thought were more like brutes than men; but they offered me no violence. When I came into the cabin, I was placed behind a large che&s;t of arms, which was their table; where I &s;at for &s;everal hours, very &s;till, and laboured to get to &s;uch a right and true compo&s;ure of mind, that I might be enabled to un|dergo, with patience, what was then befallen me.</P>
<P>The hurry about the booty being pretty much over, towards night they came to &s;ettle in the cabin; and &s;eeing me take little notice of what they either &s;aid or did, they looked earne&s;tly at me, and a&s;ked our captain who I was. He told <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hem I was a Quaker mini&s;ter, and in|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">d for Penn&s;ylvania. They made
<PB N="18" REF="018146_0018_0FA561152DDA3090">
many fine &s;peeches, and told me, I was welcome to any thing they had, and would have me call for what I wanted. When meat came to table, they invited me to eat; but I told them I was not for eating, my appetite being quite gone. When they thought it was time for us to go to bed, I was had down into the hold, which was &s;o clo&s;e, and the hammocks hung &s;o near to one another, I was forc|ed to creep on my hands and knees, till I came to that I was to lodge in. The young man that conducted me was one of the officers, and I un&s;ter&s;tood he put me in his own hammock. As he was making it fit, I thought he &s;eemed to do it with a very good will; but the place being &s;trait, and I lying in all my clothes, made it hard work for me to get in. How|ever, he &s;taid and helped me what he could, till I was &s;ettled in my new lodg|ing. A few hours after I had plenty of company. As they crept under me they lifted me up, and when they were all plac|ed in their re&s;pective lodgings, I perceiv|ed &s;ome lay upon the boards under me. However, the clo&s;ene&s;s of the place, and the di&s;agreeable &s;mell, with a fear which then &s;eized my mind, that the&s;e crea|tures would do me &s;ome mi&s;chief, had like to have quite over&s;et me, &s;o that I
<PB N="19" REF="018146_0019_0FA561160C367AE8">
was nigh fainting away, and ready to query, whether I &s;hould live till morning. In this great &s;trait the Lord appeared for my help. I &s;en&s;ibly felt &s;trength admini|&s;tered, and it aro&s;e in my mind, that tho&s;e I was afraid of would not hurt me. I believed it was the truth, and in a little time, being much wearied, I fell into a &s;ound &s;leep till morning. When I came upon deck, our poor men came to me, and complained of their hard lodgings, and what was wor&s;e, the thoughts of a clo&s;e impri&s;onment when they &s;hould come on &s;hore. It made me &s;orrowful to hear their complaints, for they had heard the pri&s;oners fared very poorly. I &s;pake as comfortably as I could, and ex|horted them to live in the fear of the Lord. This day we came up with a ve&s;|&s;el bound for Plymouth, taken from the French by one of our &s;hips of war. The French &s;oon brought her too, boarded her, and brought all the men to us but one. The two officers were had into the cabin where we were. The captain being a man of very &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions, to be taken pri&s;oner was almo&s;t more than he could bear: When they were &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e down, I &s;aw he was almo&s;t overcome with grief, which I a little wondered at. After &s;ome time I went and &s;at by him, and &s;aid I would
<PB N="20" REF="018146_0020_0FA56116AA1BD8A0">
not have him too much ca&s;t down; trou|ble and di&s;appointment happened to all men, and this was what &s;uch men as he might rea&s;onably expect. He &s;aid no|thing as I remember, but &s;oon went out, and after a while came again with a Frenchman along with him, who could &s;peak Engli&s;h, and pretended great friend&s;hip to me, and reque&s;ted that I would go along with him and the captain into a private place, for he was de&s;irous to have &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e with me. It did not &s;eem to &s;uit my inclination, but through their much importuning me, I went. When we were &s;ettled, the En|gli&s;hman told me, he had been attended with misfortunes even from his childhood, and thought he had been in a fair way of making his fortune, but he had met with this di&s;appointment, which was like to be a great lo&s;s to him. He then began to talk about religion, and expre&s;&s;ed a great de&s;ire in his heart to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ve in the fear of the Lord. He &s;poke highly of the ceremo|nies u&s;ed among&s;t them, mentioning bap|ti&s;m with water, and bread and wine, which they call the &s;acrament.

<P>I was much favoured with &s;tillne&s;s, and a &s;weet compo&s;ure of mind, which to my great comfort, I found did &s;trengthen and fortify me again&s;t the a&s;&s;aults of the enemy, which I met with both inwardly and outwardly. When I looked at my pre&s;ent &s;ituation, and what was likely to be the con&s;equence, fearing I might be a &s;tumbling-block in the way of many, and bring di&s;honour to Truth, I was much ca&s;t down, and did often cry, <Q>Lord, if I had been worthy, thou would&s;t have pre&s;erved me out of the hands of &s;uch unrea&s;onable men.</Q> But the good Shepherd of I&s;rael did ca&s;t his man|tle of love over me and &s;tilled my cry|ing, &s;o that I was in a good degree made willing to &s;ubmit to what he &s;hould &s;ee meet to &s;uffer to come upon me. Whil&s;t I was here, &s;ervent and &s;trong de&s;ires were in my heart for tho&s;e I had left be|hind me, in many places, that they might be pre&s;erved in the fear of the Lord. As to outward food, I eat very little &s;everal days. Many &s;aid, I &s;hould be &s;ick, and often intreated me to eat; but I did not eat much, till I found I could take it both with freedom of mind, and a good appetite, which had been quite gone.

The Frehchmen, as I frequently walked upon deck among&s;t them, were become milder, and never offered to do me any harm, except one at the fir&s;t, and he was prevented from hurting me. I al&s;o &s;at, and walked often upon quarter deck, the officers all looking on me with a plea&s;ant countenance, except the captain, who, I &s;uppo&s;e, took offence at my not conform|ing to them when they went to prayers, which was twice a day,</P>
<P>One evening, as we were &s;itting in the cabin, a young Frenchman a&s;ked the man of war's captain before mentioned (pointing at me) concerning our princi|ples. He told him, we were a &s;trange people; we both di&s;owned bapti&s;m and the Lord's &s;upper. The Frenchman looked at me with di&s;dain, and then be|gan to &s;peak much in behalf of both, laying great &s;tre&s;s, e&s;pecially upon the latter; for he &s;eemed a very zealous young man far their way. Then both joining, they came to a conclu&s;ion, that tho&s;e who were not in the practice of them, could not be &s;aved. Their di&s;|cour&s;e was in Latin, and though I am not a Latin &s;cholar, I under&s;tood &s;o much, that I gathered the purport of their di&s;|cour&s;e.

the people called Quakers to that man. He a&s;ked in what? I told him, I under&s;tood he had been telling him we di&s;owned bapti&s;m, and the &s;up|per. He &s;aid, he under&s;tood by me, that we did not own the &s;acraments. I told him, there was no &s;uch word made u&s;e of in &s;cripture, that I knew of; but bapti&s;m and the &s;upper were, and we owned and believed both to be e&s;&s;ential to &s;alvation. My mind was then opened concerning bapti&s;m, in the &s;everal pa&s;|&s;ages of &s;cripture, which &s;trengthen and confirm it, that the bapti&s;m, which is &s;aving, mu&s;t needs be &s;piritual; and if &s;o, then no need of water: for the apo&s;tle &s;aith, <Q>One Lord, one faith, one bap|ti&s;m,</Q> Eph. iv. 5. and that them&s;elves owned water to be but an outward and vi&s;ible &s;ign of an inward and &s;piritual grace. I was led on, till I came to that la&s;t &s;upper or pa&s;&s;over, which our Lord did partake of with his di&s;ciples; and told them what our Lord then &s;aid to his di&s;ciples, was, <Q>As often as ye do this, do it in remembrance of me, to &s;hew forth my death until I come.</Q> This was no commandment to perpetuate that outward &s;upper, or pa&s;&s;over; that being a Jewi&s;h ordinance, which he then had nigh fini&s;hed, when he nailed the hand|writing
<PB N="24" REF="018146_0024_0FA5611E730A2D68">
of ordinances to his cro&s;s. But I told them, they might &s;ee in the Reve|lations of John, what he &s;aid concerning his coming, where he faith, <Q>Behold I &s;tand at the door, and knock; and if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and &s;up with him, and he with me.</Q> Rev. iii. 20. It is this &s;upper and coming we own, and in our mea&s;ure partake of; for this was the communion of the &s;aints. Seve|ral texts of &s;cripture opening in my mind to confirm that bapti&s;m and &s;upper, which are &s;aving, to be &s;piritual; and as bodily exerci&s;e profiteth little, &s;o that which is only outward and elementary, could not profit the &s;oul. They heard me very pa|tiently, and did not make any objections. Being pretty ea&s;y, I left them to have their di&s;cour&s;e to them&s;elves, that the officer might have opportunity to inform the man what I had &s;aid.</P>
<P>Now our confinement at &s;ea was nigh over, but as we came nigh in with the &s;hore, we were cha&s;ed by an Engli&s;h man of war, who came fa&s;t up with us, and gave our men great expectations of being relea&s;ed; and indeed the Frenchmen ex|pected no other than to be taken. Every man prepared him&s;elf for removing, and was in great fear; but we were &s;o near

the rocks, the man of war dur&s;t follow us no farther, only gave us one &s;hot, which came over us, and then &s;heered off. The great expectation our men were in of being retaken being di&s;appointed, made them more &s;orrowful than before; but it did not much affect me, for I was now more reconciled in my mind, to bear with patience what the Lord &s;hould &s;ee meet to try me with. I had &s;trongly de|&s;ired before not to go to France, but in a few hours we came into a &s;mall harbour, with a fort at the entrance, and in it one &s;hip of war. We did not land till next morning. This night I met with &s;ome|thing that was very unplea&s;ant to me, for the captain going on &s;hore, and the men thinking all &s;ecure, when night came on, mo&s;t of them went to re&s;t; but the man of war's captain, and &s;ome of his men, as it afterwards appeared, had con&s;ulted about cutting the ve&s;&s;el out of the harbour. We had more liberty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i|ven this night than we had before. The two man of war's men, our captain, and my&s;elf, were ordered to lie in the cabin. Riddel had lain in it before, but now he was to lie in the captain's hammock, being a favourite, and I in his bed; but he not accepting of it, I got in. This I per|ceived gave great offence, therefore, to

prevent further trouble, I &s;oon quitted it, and &s;at me down by the man of war's captain, who had got to writing</P>
<P>I had by this time contracted &s;uch an intimacy with him, that I could make bold to &s;ee what he was writing, without giving him any offence; and when I came to &s;ee what he was writing, and found it was only to &s;pend time&punc; it gave me &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s, for it then began to be late. I did not &s;uddenly &s;ay any thing to him, but took notice of his motions and looks, and &s;aw his countenance was very much di&s;compo&s;ed. All began now to be very &s;till. None were up in the cabin but him and my&s;elf, and the young French|man before-mentioned, who kept guard, and he had no weapon in his hand. I a&s;ked the captain if he was not for bed. He &s;aid, he could not go to bed. I then told him, I would not have him think of making any attempts to take the ve&s;&s;el out of the harbour. He &s;aid, he &s;hould make no difficulty of it, if he had any body to &s;tand by him. I &s;ignified, I thought it could not be done without much blood-&s;hedding, if at all; and I &s;hould be very &s;orry to &s;ee any thing of that kind, though my liberty was as dear to me as any of theirs. He &s;aid, I need not be afraid; no body would hurt me.

I told him, that was more than he knew; for as I had been with them all the even|ing, they would think I had a hand in the plot, and &s;o I might lo&s;e my life un|de&s;ervedly.</P>
<P>I laid before him all the difficulties I was capable of, as that of lying under the fort, and their man of war a little di&s;tance off, with a very rocky harbour to get out of; all which &s;eemed to have but little effect on him. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o I thought it was be&s;t to con&s;ult my own &s;afety; for if there was a &s;kirmi&s;h, I &s;hould, if I &s;taid there, be in the mid&s;t of it. So I went down to my old lodgings; but could find no re&s;t for my body, my mind being very unea|&s;y. I therefore crept out again, all being &s;till in the &s;hip, and but few upon deck. I went into the cabin, where I found them as I left them; but having a little more courage than before, I told the captain I was re&s;olved to hinder any di&s;turbance, if I could; adding he &s;urely was not in his right &s;en&s;es to think of any &s;uch thing, as his men, I &s;uppo&s;ed, knew nothing of it. He &s;aid I was mi&s;taken, for he had told one or two of them in the evening, and they would acquaint all the re&s;t, and he could have them all up in a few minutes.</P>

I therefore &s;at me down clo&s;e by him, with an intent to lay hold of him if he offered to take up a weapon, which was very nigh at hand. Great &s;trugglings were in his mind, as he him&s;elf afterwards confe&s;&s;ed. He often was ju&s;t upon the point; but the Lord, in his great mercy, did interpo&s;e, and my mind began to be calm and &s;till, and all fear was taken away.

&s;hip, which was &s;o narrow, I could only lie upon my &s;ide: there being nothing better in the cabin that I could find. But my mind being ea&s;y, after the pain it had been in, I fell a&s;leep. It was a very cold night, and the partition of our cabin was but canva&s;s. When I awaked I was &s;tiff, but I did not take cold. The Lord was plea&s;ed to pre&s;erve me, though I often &s;aid in my mind, I did not think my&s;elf worthy, and more e&s;pecially be|cau&s;e he had &s;uffered this great exerci&s;e to come upon me; which, I &s;everal times was made &s;en&s;ible, would have been a light matter with him to have hindered, if he had &s;een meet. I often cried to him in the &s;ecret of my heart, that if there was any iniquity lodging in me, he would be plea&s;ed to take it away; and if this my going was not con&s;i&s;tent with his will, that he would be plea&s;ed to &s;hew me how, and wherein I had mi&s;&s;ed my way; that I might not bring a reproach upon the Truth, and a trouble and exerci&s;e upon his people. It was not long we had to &s;tay among&s;t this &s;ort of company, for by that time the &s;un was up, the captain, with &s;everal more &s;uch as him&s;elf, came aboard; al&s;o two of their friars in their odd &s;ort of dre&s;s; I &s;uppo&s;e to &s;ee what they could get in the &s;cramble.</P>

<P>We were on board eleven days, and then were landed near a town called Ro&s;cone. When we came to it, many people were gathered to &s;ee us, among&s;t whom was a mixture of black coats: two of them came to me, and one tak|ing hold of my &s;leeve, a&s;ked me, as I &s;uppo&s;ed, what religion I was of, and whether I could &s;peak Latin.

prie&s;ts, there came a man to me, who &s;eemed to be of &s;ome con&s;iderable ac|count in the world, and &s;aid, he was &s;orry to &s;ee me there; but it was the for|tune of war He wi&s;hed me &s;afe in England again. He went to one of his acquaintance who lived in the town, and after &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e, he came and invited me and Riddel, with the other two, to his hou&s;e, and &s;et before us &s;uch as they had, and de&s;ired us to eat and drink. There was al&s;o a woman in the hou&s;e, much concerned about our having to walk to Morlaix that night, which was twelve miles, and &s;ent to hire hor&s;es, but none were to be had. She therefore gave &s;trict charge to the &s;oldiers that conducted us, to hire hor&s;es at the next place, and &s;he would pay the charge. I wi&s;h many may follow her example in being kind to &s;trangers; for what &s;he did I thought was of great &s;ervice to me. The &s;oldiers hired hor&s;es for four of us when we came to the next town, which was four miles. This town was pretty large, and there were many &s;pectators. That they might have a full view of us, the &s;oldiers had us into a convenient place, and &s;tood round us at a little di&s;tance. The people gathered &s;o thick, they could &s;carce &s;tand one by another; and in this po&s;ture they

kept us about half an hour. Then they had us to an inn, where we were put in|to a large chamber, and meat and drink were &s;et before us. But before we were well &s;at down, &s;everal men and women of the upper rank came in; the rabble &s;tayed mo&s;tly below.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t we were at meat, &s;ome of them turned up my coat laps, and examined what my clothes were made of as well as they could, and commended them for being good.

Several gay women &s;at behind the table, where they had op|portunity to look at me as much as they plea&s;ed. They were very light and airy, which I &s;hewed &s;ome di&s;like to, and told them I had heard the French u&s;ed good manners, and knew how to behave well; but it could not be &s;aid &s;o of them, for it was not good manners to come into our room without leave, and when they were in, not to behave &s;oberly and well. I &s;oon perceived I had an interpreter, for &s;ome among them under&s;tood Engli&s;h, and informed the re&s;t; upon which they left the room, and it was &s;oon pretty clear.

a book, out of which he &s;aid he taught his children, and as he read, &s;ome of our people were &s;o weak as to commend it, which made him more eager. I do not remember that I either an&s;wered any of his que&s;tions, or made any objections to what he &s;aid; but when he told me, he intended to bring &s;ome of my bre|thren to &s;ee me, meaning the prie&s;ts, for he &s;aid they would like to have &s;ome di&s;|cour&s;e with me; I told him he need not bring any there upon my account, for I did not want any of their company: &s;o that was put an end to, for they never came to me while I &s;taid in Morlaix.

This man and his wi&s;e took great offence at my hat being in its place, as likewi&s;e did the commi&s;&s;ary at Ro&s;cone, who was an old man, and ill of the gout, upon his bed. But &s;everal capital people of the town being pre&s;ent, he was much di&s;|plea&s;ed, becau&s;e I did not give them that honour which was none of their due. When I had given in my name, I &s;oon quitted the room This commi&s;&s;ary was a young man, and &s;everal were in the room with him I had not a&s;ked any body to be bail for me, for I was ea&s;y, and the thoughts of the pri&s;on did not terrify me, though we had heard a very di&s;mal account of it; however Forney, whom I mentioned before, after he had called Riddel a&s;ide, and a&s;ked him con|cerning me&punc; ventured to be bail for me. I &s;taid a little while in the room after our people were withdrawn, and looked at the great man as he &s;at in his chair, and thought his countenance was &s;omewhat milder, and he &s;pake pretty kindly to me when we parted.

<P>Forney, who had pa&s;&s;ed his word for me, being agent, had my papers and letters, which I found he did not chu&s;e to part with, except my certificate and letter of credit, and another paper or two, which he did not think worth while to keep. I perceived he was a &s;elfi&s;h man, for after he under&s;tood my little money that I &s;hould want was not to come through his hands, he came to me, and with an unplea&s;ant tone told me, he would not &s;tand bound for me any longer. I &s;aid, I did not intend to give him any offence in employing another to do my bu&s;ine&s;s: viz. Charles Serman&s;on, a merchant, who was of great &s;ervice to me afterwards, when I came to be ac|quainted with him. When he heard Forney would not be bound for me any longer, he &s;aid, he would be bound for me, as freely as he would for his own brother. So I was &s;till kept out of pri|&s;on.

Then after a pretty long pau&s;e, he &s;aid, now I have &s;ome clo&s;e que&s;tions to a&s;k you, but you mu&s;t, not be angry. I was &s;ilent, not knowing how I &s;hould come off. He then a&s;ked me, whether I was a mini&s;ter? I &s;aid, I did not chu&s;e to be put under that de|nomination, He &s;aid, what then? I told him, my bu&s;ine&s;s, when at home, was to look after and &s;eed cattle, and &s;uch in our country were called graziers. He a&s;ked me what I was going to do in Penn&s;ylvania? I &s;aid, to vi&s;it my friends.

Whether I knew any body there? I &s;aid I was acquainted with but a few. Whether I was &s;ent by the Quakers? I told him, I was not; though I had their approbation therein.

<P>About this time I &s;uffered much in my &s;pirit; the rea&s;on is be&s;t known to the Lord.

from evil, and falling into temptation. Though &s;uch company as I had was very unplea&s;ant to me, and I thought my&s;elf unfit for conver&s;ation; yet, when by hone&s;t inquirers, I was a&s;ked que&s;tions concerning our faith and principles, I was helped, in the openings of Truth, to give them an an&s;wer concerning the hope that was in me: &s;criptures freely opening, and all things brought to my remembrance, &s;ufficient to put to &s;ilence, and &s;top the mouths of gain&s;ayers.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t I &s;taid in Morlaix, Charles Serman&s;on (before mentioned) who often invited me to his hou&s;e, one evening, as we were in di&s;cour&s;e, a&s;ked me, why I went abroad in &s;uch trouble&s;ome times? I told him, I believed it to be my duty; for nothing el&s;e would have induced me to leave all that were near to me in this world, as wife and children, but a &s;en&s;e of duty to God, and obedience to what I believed he required of me; for as to outward gain or advantage, I had no|thing of that in my view, for &s;uch as have freely received, mu&s;t freely give.</P>

When &s;he under<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tood I had left a wife and children

behind me, &s;he &s;aid that could not be con&s;i&s;tent with the will of God. I &s;ig|nified, &s;he did not con&s;ider Chri&s;t faith, <Q>He that loveth father or mother, wife or children, hou&s;es or lands, more than me, is not worthy of me.</Q> I took the liberty to reprove her hu&s;band, for taking the great and &s;acred name in vain, which I &s;uppo&s;e made &s;ome altera|tion in his countenance. She then a&s;ked him what I &s;aid. When he told her, &s;he &s;aid, I had done well, for that was his great weakne&s;s, and &s;he hoped he would take notice of it. I &s;aid, by turning our minds to the light of Chri&s;t in our hearts, which reproveth for &s;in, as we came to yield obedience to it, we &s;hould be help|ed to overcome our weakne&s;&s;es.

I have nothing to boa&s;t of, and by Grace I am &s;aved out of many temptations of the world; yet was a man of like pa&s;&s;ions, and liable to ma|ny weakne&s;&s;es, as they were; and was no longer &s;afe than whil&s;t I kept upon my watch. My mind was opened to point out to them the way of &s;alvation, &s;crip|ture being brought to confirm the &s;uffi|ciency, work, and operation of the Grace of God, upon the hearts of the children

of men; with the &s;aving help there is in it, as it is yielded obedience unto. It was a &s;ea&s;onable opportunity. Finding freedom, I let him &s;ee the certificate I had from my friends. When he had read it, he &s;aid, he liked it very well. I told him &s;omething of the good order we had among&s;t us, which he &s;eemed to approve well of; but &s;aid, he could but admire that I &s;hould take &s;o much pains, without any view of outward advantage.

<P>Perceiving that what had already pa&s;|&s;ed had &s;ome good effect, for the man was very loving, and his under&s;tanding mea&s;urably opened, to di&s;tingui&s;h be|tween the true and fal&s;e mini&s;ters, I took my leave for that time, and went to my quarters, which were at a tavern, where I was for &s;everal days, and had much company of divers &s;orts.

I told him, the weapons of the primitive Believers were not carnal, but &s;piritual, and mighty, through faith, to the pulling down &s;in, and the &s;trong holds of Satan; and &s;uch as ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> now come under the peaceable government of the great King of Kings (who &s;aid, if his kingdom had been of this world, then his &s;ervants would have fought) cannot fight with carnal weapons, though there &s;hould &s;eem as great a nece&s;&s;ity, as there was when our Lord was like to be delivered to the Jews. I had to open &s;e|veral pa&s;&s;ages of Scripture, which &s;et forth the peaceable government of Chri&s;t, who came not to de&s;troy men's lives, but to &s;ave them; and that it was not the lamb's nature to tear and devour, but the wolf's. This opportunity was &s;ea|&s;onable, the people were very &s;till and attentive.

<P>After &s;ome time. I was, with &s;ome others who were pri&s;oners at large, ordered into the country about thirty miles, to a town called Carh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ix. Charles Serman&s;on &s;upplied me with what money I wanted,

and al&s;o recommended me to a friend of his there, one John Grace, a coun&s;ellor at law, who, during my &s;tay, &s;hewed &s;everal tokens of his regard and hearty friend&s;hip, after he and I came to be ac|quainted; though I may &s;ay with &s;afety, I never &s;ought his, nor any other's fa|vour, by any indirect means, or in a way Truth did not admit of. When I went to his hou&s;e, it was in the evening, and he taking the letter with his hat off, made a bow, but I not returning it as he expected, he with an earned look, and &s;omewhat of an unplea&s;ant tone, &s;aid, I might go to the tavern, and he would come to me in the morning. He did &s;o, and told me, as I had been recommended to his care by his good friend Charles Serman&s;on, he would do the be&s;t he could in providing me a private lodging; and any other &s;ervice he could do me, which lay in his power, &s;hould not be wanting. I told him, I was obliged to him, and was glad to find him, and &s;ome others of his countrymen, &s;o well di&s;|po&s;ed as to be kind to &s;trangers; and as I as a &s;tranger, and al&s;o a pri&s;oner, I &s;hould be glad of his a&s;&s;i&s;tance.

duty. Then we walked into the town, where he provided me a chamber, and I had every thing found me that was nece&s;&s;ary. My new landlord took great notice of my behaviour, and, I &s;uppo&s;e, at fir&s;t did not know how to behave him|&s;elf towards me, that I might not be offended; for being poor, he was glad of a little money. He could &s;peak no En|gli&s;h, and I but little French, &s;o we could have no conver&s;ation; but he told one of the Engli&s;hmen, who &s;poke French, that I did him good, though he could not under&s;tand me. He was a peruke-maker by trade, and when he had left work in the evenings, he and his wife would come and &s;it with me a con&s;iderable time in &s;ilence; which was not di&s;agreeable to me: for &s;ometimes, I believe, we were favoured with good, when we &s;at in &s;ilence. His wife was a religious woman, and of a &s;olid &s;ober behaviour, &s;o far as I ever &s;aw. I &s;taid in their hou&s;e three months, and then took lodgings in another place; three young men in like circum&s;tances with my &s;elf, de&s;iring very much to be with me, and they not having room for us all, I left them. As the young men behaved well, their company was agreeable; two of them being friends &s;ons, though they did

As the&s;e things affected and made &s;ome im|pre&s;&s;ions upon my mind, I made a few remarks.</P>
<P>John Grace, the coun&s;ellor, after a little while, became very loving, and had me often to his hou&s;e, it not being far from my lodgings, and I found my&s;elf very free to conver&s;e with him, and told him in freedom at one time, if he had any thing in his mind to a&s;k concerning our &s;ociety or principles, I would have him be quite free, for I &s;hould be willing to an&s;wer hone&s;tly according to the be&s;t of my under&s;tanding. He &s;aid, he un|der&s;tood we did not bapti&s;e with water.

&s;oul. The &s;ame apo&s;tle &s;aid,<Q>He was not &s;ent to bapti&s;e, (he there mu&s;t be under&s;tood with water) but to preach the go&s;pel, which is the power that bapti&s;eth into the one Spirit.</Q> He further &s;aith concerning him&s;elf, that he was not aw hit behind the chiefe&s;t of the apo&s;tles; yet he thanks God, he had bapti&s;ed no more than the few he recites, which he would not have done, if bap|ti&s;m with water had been the one bap|ti&s;m e&s;&s;ential to &s;alvation. He &s;aid, he thought there our ought to be &s;omething done to children by the mini&s;ter, to initi|ate them into the church. I &s;aid, as to our not being in the practi&s;e of &s;prink|ling children with water, or &s;igning them with the &s;ign of the cro&s;s, as it was not &s;criptural, we could not be ju&s;tly blamed for being in the di&s;u&s;e of it. He then &s;aid, if he at fir&s;t had put on the prie&s;t's gown, in&s;tead of that he then wore, he &s;hould have thought it his bu&s;ine&s;s to have &s;earched more into the Scriptures.

and as for him, he was but a hearer and if they deceived him, it would be the wor&s;e for them&s;elves; they could not de|ceive God. I &s;aid, it was true, they could not; but as the &s;alvation of the &s;oul is a thing of &s;o great moment, we &s;hould not have our dependence upon others, and as to teachers, we might know them by their fruits; for, accord|ing to Chri&s;t's own words, <Q>men do not gather grapes of thorns, nor figs of thi&s;tles.</Q> He further &s;aith to his mini&s;ters, <Q>freely you have received, freely give.</Q> As to tho&s;e of polluted lips.

I &s;aid, it was great pity any &s;hould be deprived of the benefit of the Scriptures, for all ought to have liberty to try all things, that they may hold fa&s;t that which is good; for it is dangerous pinning their faith upon other men's &s;leeves: <Q>if the blind lead the blind, they will both fall into the ditch.</Q> He then &s;aid, he &s;hould be glad to read &s;ome of our authors, which I gave him

I &s;aid, the one bapti&s;m, which we believe to be &s;aving and e&s;&s;en|tial to &s;alvation, is &s;piritual, that of fire and the Holy Gho&s;t; and as to little chil|dren, they are heirs of the kingdom of heaven without water, or the help of any mortal man. I told him, I had heard he &s;aid &s;omething again&s;t me, but I came in good will to pay him a friendly vi&s;it, for I had a mind to &s;peak with him my&s;elf. He then took me by the hand, &s;aying, he would not do me any hurt, but all the &s;ervice that lay in his power. I took my leave of him with thankfulne&s;s; that truth had thus far prevailed, and the young man was well &s;atisfied; for he was &s;omewhat in fear before we went, having heard what the commi&s;&s;ary had &s;aid concerning me.

<P>Charles Serman&s;on, whil&s;t I was here, wrote me &s;everal kind letters; and mine, which I wrote to England, he took care to &s;end to his corre&s;pondent in London; by whom al&s;o my letters from home were &s;afely conveyed to me, which made my confinement much the ea&s;ier. as I could often hear from my wife and family, and they from me.

The fourth of the week, accompanied by another friend, had two meetings at Mount Holly, both to pretty good &s;atis|faction: we lodged at Jo&s;iah Fo&s;ter's. Fifth day we had a meeting at a &s;chool-hou&s;e, which was large, and though it held long, the people were very quiet: we lodged at William Smith's. Sixth day we had a meeting at Old Spring|field; fir&s;t day at Mansfield. It was a large meeting, but the minds of the peo|ple hankering much after words, the &s;pring of life, that had run through me, being in a great mea&s;ure &s;topt, a cloud
<PB N="56" REF="018146_0056_0FA561417387BA08">
came and covered my tabernacle. I &s;aw it was &s;afe&s;t to &s;tand &s;till. We lodged at Peter Harvey's, a kind and &s;teady friend.</P>
<P>Next day, the &s;econd of the week, and tenth of the month, we had a meet|ing at a &s;chool-hou&s;e in the neighbour|hood, which was &s;mall, but in &s;ome de|gree &s;atisfactory: we lodged at William Smith's: had a meeting at Upper Spring|field on third day; at Freehold on fourth; Cro&s;wick's on fifth; Bordentown on &s;ixth; and Trenton on fir&s;t day: we lodged here at William Morris's. From thence to Stony Brook, and had a meet|ing on the &s;econd day of the week, and 17th of the month. We lodged at James Clark's. In this place they had been hurt, and &s;cattered in their minds; as al&s;o in &s;everal other places, where there had been a &s;triving, and a dividing &s;pirit got in. From thence we went to Robins's meeting on third day, which was not &s;o &s;atisfactory as could have been de&s;ired; &s;ome being re&s;tle&s;s, the meeting holding long.</P>
<P>We went from thence to Squan, and had a meeting there on fifth day among&s;t a company of poor dark people Then to Shrew&s;bury the twenty-&s;econd of the tenth month, where was a meeting for mini&s;ters and elders. The meeting on
<PB N="57" REF="018146_0057_0FA56142691522B8">
fir&s;t day was very large, and, con&s;idering the great numbers of people of all ranks, was quiet. Second day it was a good &s;olid meeting, Truth prevailing over all: prai&s;es be given to the Great Name for ever. The Son of Righteou&s;ne&s;s did ari&s;e with healing in his wings, and my &s;oul was delivered, as out of the pit; for I had been ready to de&s;pair, and thought I &s;hould have been overcome by the enemy. Great horror and darkne&s;s was over my under&s;tanding for a time; but the Lord did &s;end his light, and his truth, and cau&s;ed it to &s;hine upon my tabernacle; and I had to declare of his mercy and goodne&s;s towards the children of men, and to invite them to come and &s;ee for them&s;elves, what great things the Lord will do for them that tru&s;t in him. This great meeting ended well, and I was truly thankful to the great Ma&s;ter of our a&s;&s;emblies. We lodged at Jo&s;eph Wardel's, a worthy friend.</P>
<P>On third day we came back to Cro&s;|wicks, and lodged at Thomas Middle|ton's. Next day to widow Andrews's, where my companion was taken ill. Here I left him, after &s;taying one night, and went to Haddonfield with I&s;aac An|drews, and lodged at his hou&s;e one night, and &s;o to Philadelphia, where I &s;taid till
<PB N="58" REF="018146_0058_0FA56143492E6EF0">
their quarterly meeting. We had &s;everal comfortable opportunities together. John Hunt and Chri&s;topher Wil&s;on from En|gland were here, and had good &s;ervice. I &s;taid about Philadelphia, attending meet|ings as they came in cour&s;e, both for wor&s;hip and di&s;cipline, until the fifteenth of the eleventh month, when I &s;et out towards the &s;outhern provinces, Tho|mas Lightfoot accompanying me. We went to Che&s;ter, and were at their youth's quarterly meeting, which was a time to be remembered by many of us.</P>
<P>We vi&s;ited the meetings through Che&s;ter county, till we came to Notting|ham, and were at the monthly meeting, John Hunt al&s;o being there. It was a &s;uffering time to me, I being &s;en&s;ible ma|ny were wor&s;hipping only in the outward court, who&s;e dwelling was in the form without the power, &s;uch cau&s;e &s;uffering to the true &s;eed. I &s;taid meeting with them on fir&s;t day, and was led to &s;peak clo&s;ely to &s;everal &s;tates, and left them pretty ea&s;y in my own mind. I lodged at John Churchman's, and had a meeting at We&s;t-Nottingham on third day; at Little Britain on fourth day, here &s;everal Pre&s;byterians came in, with their prie&s;t, who took down in writing what I &s;aid; though I perceived not that he was wri|ting,
<PB N="59" REF="018146_0059_0FA56143EB892C10">
till I had nigh done &s;peaking. When I &s;at down, mo&s;t of them went out, but he &s;taid; and, after a &s;hort &s;pace, I had to &s;ay, <Q>The time &s;hall come, when the dead &s;hall hear the voice of the Son of God (or they that are dead in forms;) and they that hear and obey &s;hall live; and that Chri&s;t is the re&s;urrection, and the life, and he that liveth and believeth in him, though he is dead, yet &s;hall he live.</Q> I did not enlarge much upon it; but the meeting broke up in a good degree of life, and the prie&s;t went off with his company. Friends thought there was no danger of any ill coming of it, but I was afraid, left Truth &s;hould &s;uffer.</P>
<P>I rode that evening after meeting to William Downing's, who had a large family, with whom we had a good oppor|tunity. Thence we came to Sad&s;bury, where I had a meeting, and in the open|ings of truth, had clo&s;ely to &s;peak to the &s;tates of many. From thence I went to Lampiter, where I had two mee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ings; and &s;o to Lanca&s;ter, and had a meeting with the few friends that lived there. We lodged at I&s;aac Whitelock's; and after having a meeting at James Wright's, we cro&s;&s;ed the river Su&s;quehannah, and went to York, where a few friends dwelt,
<PB N="60" REF="018146_0060_0FA56144A4B310B8">
and had a meeting among them. We quartered at Nathan Hu&s;&s;ey's.</P>
<P>Our next meeting was at Newberry; it was &s;ilent, but to my &s;atisfaction. We pa&s;&s;ed through Warrington, but had no meetings it being the youth's quarterly meeting, at Huntington, where we had an edifying time together. We had al&s;o meetings at Moynallan, John Evans's, Pipe-Creek, Bu&s;h-Creek, and Monoque|&s;y. Then cro&s;&s;ing Potomack, we came into Virginia, to Fairfax; where we had a meeting on the &s;econd day of the week, and twelfth of the twelfth month. It was a good meeting, Truth having the dominion: magnified be the great name of I&s;rael's God, and that for evermore! We lodged at Mary Janey's, a di&s;creet orderly woman, who had &s;everal &s;ober well-inclined children. From hence we went to Goo&s;e Creek, and had a meet|ing on third day: it was well. On fourth day we had a meeting at David Pole's, &s;everal friends accompanying us. I had a travail in &s;pirit, that Truth might not lo&s;e ground; finding a &s;pirit of ea&s;e had greatly prevailed in many of the pro|fe&s;&s;ors of Truth, to the &s;orrow of the hone&s;t hearted. We left David Pole's hou&s;e on fifth day, and rode over the Blue Ridge, or Blue Mountains, where
<PB N="61" REF="018146_0061_0FA561452D12ECD8">
the Indians had done much mi&s;chief, by burning hou&s;es, killing, de&s;troying, and carrying many people away captives; but friends had not hitherto been hurt: yet &s;everal had left their plantations, and fled back again over the Blue Mountains, where the lands had been rightly pur|cha&s;ed of the Indians.</P>
<P>Things &s;eemed dreadful, and &s;everal hearts ready to fail. We proceeded on our journey, and came within &s;ix miles of Winche&s;ter, where the Engli&s;h had a fort. On &s;ixth day we had a meeting at Hopewell, which was an open time. I found my mind much engaged for the poor &s;uffering people, but had to tell them, their greate&s;t enemies were tho&s;e of their own hou&s;es. The meeting end|ed well. We lodged at Jo&s;eph Lupton's, an ancient friend, who with his wife were very loving to us. The Indians had killed and carried away &s;everal within a few miles of their habitation; yet they did not &s;eem much afraid; for they &s;aid, they did not &s;o much as pull in their &s;neek-&s;tring of the door when they went to bed, and had neither lock nor bar. We had a meeting at Crooked-run on fir&s;t day, the eighteenth of the twelfth month. It was a good meeting, the
<PB N="62" REF="018146_0062_0FA56145ECD4C2C8">
Lord favouring with his living pre&s;ence. Glory be to his great Name for ever!</P>
<P>On &s;econd day we &s;et forward through the woods, and over the hills and rocks, cro&s;&s;ing &s;everal large creeks. We came in the evening to a man's hou&s;e, called Mo&s;es Mackoy, and had a meeting there next day. They were an un&s;ettled peo|ple, yet a&s;&s;ented to Truth; but were not fully convinced in their minds, concern|ing the &s;ufficiency of it, having an eye to outward &s;hadows: I left them in good will. On fourth day we rode about thir|ty miles to Smith's Creek, where we had a meeting on fifth day, at the hou&s;e of William Caroll. It was &s;ilent, though they had &s;ent notice &s;everal miles, and many came. I told them, though I had nothing to communicate by way of preaching, or declaration, yet I found freedom to have another opportunity at a proper time and place: which I had next day at the hou&s;e of John Mills, about ten miles off, &s;omewhat on our way. The meeting was to good &s;atisfaction. The Indians had killed and taken away people within two or three miles of this place, not many weeks before; but the Lord pre&s;erved us in our journey Thank&s;|giving and prai&s;e be to him, and that for ever!</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="018146_0063_0FA56146AA7AE0C0">Seventh day we &s;et out towards the &s;outh parts, and lodged that night at the foot of the Blue Mountains, at a friendly man's hou&s;e, having two friends to con|duct us. Next day, being the fir&s;t of the week, we cro&s;&s;ed the mountains, and towards evening came to Dougla&s;s's, and had a meeting with the family. The twenty-&s;eventh, and third of the week, we had a meeting at Camp Creek. It was a pretty open meeting, though the &s;en&s;e of good is almo&s;t lo&s;t among&s;t them in that place, and their &s;tates much to be lamented. We lodged at Charles Mo|man's. Next day we rode fifteen miles, and lodged at Francis Clark's, and had a meeting at Fork Creek. Many people came, and &s;at with great attention, and the meeting was &s;olid.</P>
<P>From thence we went to Jenito, where we had a meeting, and many people came, but it being &s;ilent, they &s;eemed di&s;&s;atisfied. As I had nothing to &s;ay, I was glad I could be made willing to be what the Lord &s;aw meet to allot me. We lodged at Jane Watkins's, a widow woman, She received us kindly, and had &s;everal loving and well-inclined chil|dren. We had a meeting at Cedar Creek on &s;eventh day, the thirty-fir&s;t of the twelfth month 1757. It was a &s;atisfacto|ry
<PB N="64" REF="018146_0064_0FA56147A461A110">
and good meeting. Truth had the dominion, prai&s;es be to the great Giver of every good and perfect gift!&mdash;I lodged at William Stanley's.</P>
<P>From thence we went to Caroline, where the meeting was on fir&s;t day, the fir&s;t of the fir&s;t month 1758. It was a large and good meeting. The &s;tates of the people were &s;o &s;poken to, that through the Lord's goodne&s;s and conde|&s;cen&s;ion, I hope may tend to his honour, and to the help of his poor creatures. We lodged at Morner Chigles's, and al&s;o at John Chigles's, one night. Next meeting we were at the Swamp. It &s;eemed to me, as I travelled along through the&s;e parts, true religion was much want|ing among many of the profe&s;&s;ors of it. I lodged at William John&s;on's. The next meeting was at the Black Creek. It was a good time to me, and hope al&s;o to &s;ome others: prai&s;es be to the great Name! I lodged at an old man's hou&s;e that night. On the &s;eventh of the week, and &s;eventh of the month, the meeting was at White Oak Swamp, being month|ly meeting, and then rode to Curls, and lodged at John Plea&s;ant's, a very kind friend. We were at their meeting on fir&s;t day. The third of the week, and tenth of the month, had a meeting at Wion
<PB N="65" REF="018146_0065_0FA5614AF40E7A20">
Oak, fourteen miles from Curls, which was &s;atisfactory. We lodged at John Crew's, and on fourth day came back to John Plea&s;ant's. On fifth day we rode to Robert Langley's nigh Peter&s;|burgh, and on &s;ixth day had a meeting at the hou&s;e of a friend called Butter.</P>
<P>It was an acceptable time to &s;ome.</P>
<P>After meeting we went to Robert Langley's, where we were kindly enter|tained. On fir&s;t day we were at Patti&s;on's meeting, which was a low time with me; yet truth in &s;ome good degree did pre|vail. On &s;econd day we came to Bur|leigh, and lodged at John Honeycut's, and had a meeting at Burleigh on third day, which was to &s;ome acceptable. We lodged at Wike Honeycut's, and were at the monthly meeting at Surry-black Wa|ter, where we had good &s;ervice for Truth. They being in the mixture, &s;uffered peo|ple of other &s;ocieties to &s;it with them in their meetings of bu&s;ine&s;s. I was griev|ed, and could not be ea&s;y till I had de&s;ired them to withdraw, that did not make profe&s;&s;ion with us, both from the men's, and women's meeting. I had to recom|mend to the onene&s;s is and &s;implicity Truth led into, and to keep their meetings <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or di&s;cipline, in that wi&s;dom, power, and authority that they were at fir&s;t &s;et up in;
<PB N="66" REF="018146_0066_0FA5614C58B925B8">
that they might not join with the world's &s;pirit, but keep them&s;elves &s;eparate, and in the wi&s;dom and power of God, keep the authority, and bear rule over tho&s;e that were got into the mixture, and were for having tho&s;e that did not profe&s;s with us to &s;it with them, when they tran&s;acted the affairs of the church. For &s;ome that profe&s;&s;ed Truth had encouraged this prac|tice, which tended to weaken the hands of the hone&s;t-hearted, they not having found that liberty and freedom to &s;peak &s;o clo&s;ely to their brethren, as need re|quired. Jo&s;eph could not u&s;e that free|dom, and unbo&s;om him&s;elf to his bre|thren, in &s;uch a manner as the ca&s;e re|quired, till the Egyptians were gone out. I was glad I was there, for Truth had the dominion in the end. We lodged at An&s;elm Baly's. I vi&s;ited all the little handfuls &s;cattered up and down in the&s;e parts, and often had &s;ervice in families. I met with Samuel Spavold, who like|wi&s;e was much engaged in the &s;ervice of Truth. His labour of love in the work of the go&s;pel was indeed great in this part of the world; tho&s;e of other &s;ocie|ties being much reached by his mini&s;try. We were truly glad to &s;ee each other; for as iron &s;harpeneth iron, &s;o doth a man the countenance of his friend. We
<PB N="67" REF="018146_0067_0FA5614E325FC080">
had &s;everal comfortable and confirming &s;ea&s;ons together, e&s;pecially at the quar|terly meeting held at Black Creek for that part of Virginia; many friends from divers places being there. I was glad to &s;ee them, but what made us more glad, and brought us nearer to one another, was, becau&s;e the Lord favoured us with his pre&s;ence, and filled our hearts with his pure love.</P>
<P>Having nigh vi&s;ited all the meetings in this province, was taking my leave of many of them in time, &s;o far as I could &s;ee them. Taking a few meetings in my way, in company with Samuel Spavold, I proceeded towards North Carolina, but left him to vi&s;it &s;ome meetings he had not been at. I went to Pinywoods, nigh Per|quimon's River, in North Carolina; and had a meeting at Pinywoods the ninth of the &s;econd month. It was large, and at|tended with the over&s;hadowings of divine goodne&s;s. To me it was an edifying &s;trengthening time, as I tru&s;t it was to many more. We took up our quarters at Thomas Newby's: the next day we had a meeting at Wells, which was the &s;ixth of the week. On &s;eventh day we were at the Old Neck; and on fir&s;t day at Little River. This meeting was very large, there being a con&s;iderable body of
<PB N="68" REF="018146_0068_0FA5614F39C42D70">
friends in this part; and people of other &s;ocieties attend friends meetings when there are &s;trangers, I was helped through tho&s;e large a&s;&s;emblies far beyond my ex|pectation. I thought my&s;elf &s;o unfit, weak, and unworthy, that I was almo&s;t ca&s;t down in my mind before I came there; but prai&s;es and thank&s;givings to him that helped me, I left them rejoicing in a &s;en&s;e of the Lord's goodne&s;s and mercy to my &s;oul. I lodged two nights at Thomas Nichol&s;on's, who mo&s;tly fa|voured me with his company whil&s;t I was among&s;t them. Here my companion Thomas Lightfoot left me, and returned to Philadelphia. The la&s;t meeting I was at here, was appointed or Samuel Spa|vold. At Pinywoods we had a &s;olid op|portunity together, many minds being truly bowed to the root of life in them|&s;elves, and finding my&s;elf clear, may truly &s;ay, I parted with a remnant in pure love, and the unity of the one &s;pirit.</P>
<P>I then &s;et forward towards a wilder|ne&s;s country, where the inhabitants were very thin two young men accompany|ing me Our fir&s;t meeting after we left Perquimons, was at John Coupeland's. There were but few friends, but people of other &s;ocieties came in, who had no|tice;
<PB N="69" REF="018146_0069_0FA5614FDBFF7330">
among&s;t whom was an officer in the army. He came to our quarters in the morning, and rode about &s;ix miles on the road towards the meeting, then turned off, and &s;aid he would go and fetch his wife. He al&s;o brought with him a com|pany of young people, who were learn|ing to dance at his hou&s;e, which I did not know till the meeting was over, and then he came and told me, he had invit|ed them to come to the meeting, and al&s;o their ma&s;ter, but he would not come. I &s;aid, it was &s;o far well, but it was a pity he &s;hould encourage &s;uch vanity, as to keep a dancing-&s;chool at his hou&s;e. He excu&s;ed it, &s;aying, the man owed him money, and he knew not how otherways to get it, but by letting him teach his family. I &s;ignified, he had better lo&s;e it, than have his family taught that which would be unprofitable to them; for there was a woe pronounced again&s;t &s;uch as did chant to the &s;ound of the viol, and invented to them&s;elves in&s;truments of mu&s;ick, like David. He &s;aid, it was the truth that they had heard &s;poken to-day, but acknowledged they did not walk an|&s;werable to it. I &s;aid, it was their own fault; for if they would take heed to the teachings of Truth in them&s;elves it would lead them into all truth, and con&s;equently
<PB N="70" REF="018146_0070_0FA56150CB34F908">
out of all error, and every bye-path and way that lead to de&s;truction</P>
<P>After we had refre&s;hed our&s;elves, we pa&s;&s;ed his hou&s;e, and he &s;eeing us, came and invited us in, &s;aying, he had enter|tainment for us, and &s;hould be glad of our company, and we &s;hould have a room to our&s;elves I acknowledged his kind|ne&s;s, but as time would not permit, we mu&s;t proceed on our journey. We took our leave of him, and I thought he was &s;o reached, as to be mea&s;ureably con|vinced of the &s;ufficiency of the ble&s;&s;ed Truth; though his appearance, and like|wi&s;e his mind being lofty, he was not willing to &s;ubmit to the low appearance of it.</P>
<P>Our next meeting was at Thomas Knox's, a man lately convinced: it was in a good degree &s;atisfactory. We had very difficult roads, through great &s;wamps and acro&s;s many creeks, all through the woods: and in many places but little path to be &s;een. We came to Fort-River, where there is a meeting &s;ettled, of &s;uch as had been lately convinced. Many came to meeting, which was held at Henry Horn's. Some of them were un|&s;ettled in their minds, not being founded upon the &s;ure rock; but &s;uch as &s;eek &s;hall find, and they that dig deep enough
<PB N="71" REF="018146_0071_0FA5615134A8C238">
will come to the &s;ure foundation, that the righteous have built upon in all ages of the world. Henry Horn and been a teacher among the Bapti&s;ts. He &s;eem|ed to be a &s;teady well-di&s;po&s;ed man, and had a few words in meetings. After I left his hou&s;e, I had a meeting at Jo&s;eph Pitman's, who, with &s;everal others, was under convincement. It was an edifying &s;ea&s;on, many being &s;en&s;ibly touched with the love of Truth. I &s;taid with them one night, and then went to a &s;mall meeting nigh a place called Nues&punc; It was two days journey, a very difficult road to find, and none of our companions had been there before.</P>
<P>After this meeting, we went to Core Sound, an inlet of the &s;ea. We had ninety miles to ride, and were altogether unacquainted with the way, having rivers, and many &s;wamps to cro&s;s. The two young men were &s;till my companions, Jo&s;hua Fletcher, and Francis Nixon, who were very &s;erviceable to me through this almo&s;t uninhabited part of the world. We got to Henry Stanton's in the night, who took us in, and entertained us very kindly. When we had &s;taid two days, had a meeting, and re&s;ted ou&s;elves, we &s;et forward towards the next meeting among friends, which was o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e hundred
<PB N="72" REF="018146_0072_0FA56151EBCF1A68">
and fifty miles. But in our way we had two meetings among people of other &s;ocieties. I had &s;till no guide but the young men, who knew no more of the way than my&s;elf. But &s;uch as are u&s;ed to the woods can find the way through them much better than &s;uch as are not.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t meeting we had after we left Core-Sound, was at Permeanus Hauton's, who gave us an invitation to his hou&s;e, and &s;ent to give notice to his neighbours, though &s;ome lived &s;everal miles di&s;tant. We got to his hou&s;e about the time the meeting was appointed, where we found &s;eats placed, and every thing in &s;uch con|venient order for a meeting, as I thought I had &s;eldom &s;een. His rooms being little, he had placed &s;eats in his court|yard, and under the windows, that I believe a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l could &s;it and hear without the lea&s;t troubling one another; and indeed I thought his labour and good inclination were ble&s;&s;ed, for a &s;olid time it was, and I found openne&s;s to declare the Truth among&s;t them&punc; I would that all our friends, upon the like occa&s;ion, would take this man for their example, in being diligent to invite their neighbours, and to make room and accommodate them in the be&s;t manner they are capable of. It

certainly hath a good favour, and is often attended with a ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>A &s;teady friend, who had been a member among the Pre&s;byterians, told me, that the care and pains that &s;ome friends took to invite him, and &s;ome others, was one moving cau&s;e towards his convincement. He &s;aid, he once told a young man, who had frequently invited him to our meetings when &s;trangers came, that as he, nor any of his friends came to their meetings, he thought he would go no more. The young man an&s;wered very calmly, &s;aying. We mu&s;t not come to you, but we want you to come to us. "This," &s;aid he, <Q>with the diligence friends had u&s;ed without view of outward gain, affect|ed my mind, that I concluded, it mu&s;t be the love of God in their hearts, that induced them to call and invite us to come to them.</Q> This I mention more particularly, becau&s;e I have &s;een &s;ome that profe&s;s truth (to my grief) very deficient in this re&s;pect.

both in body and mind; hard things being made ea&s;y, and rough and untrod|den paths being made &s;mooth to my mind. We had a meeting al&s;o at George Cowper's, who&s;e wife was educated among friends. We &s;taid one night at Wilmington, the capital town in North Carolina; but it being their general court time, and the privateers having brought in prizes, the people's minds were in great commotions, &s;o that I could find no room nor freedom to have a meeting, though &s;everal called Quakers lived there, but held no meeting, except when &s;tran|gers came.</P>
<P>We cro&s;&s;ed a branch of Cape-Fear River, and landed upon a great &s;wamp, which was very rotten, and dangerous, by rea&s;on of the overflowing of the river; but the two young men, and a negro, whom we hired to help us, carrying boards from one place to another for the hor&s;es to tread upon, in time, and with much difficulty, we got well over. We then came again into the woods, where little path was to be &s;een; it likewi&s;e being rainy dark weather, we could not tell which way to go, but rode many miles, hoping we might be &s;teering right; and ju&s;t at the clo&s;e of the evening, be|fore it was quite dark, we came to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|tle

However, we were contented with &s;uch as we found, and thankful we fared &s;o well. We were in our direct road for the place we intended, which was Car|ver's-Creek, where we got next day, the &s;ixth of the week, and tenth of the third month. Here was a &s;mall gathering of friends. We &s;taid their fir&s;t day meeting over, and then went to Dan's-Creek, where we found another gathering of &s;uch as call them&s;elves friends, but had been much hurt, and &s;cattered in their minds from the true &s;hepherd, by an enemy that had &s;own tares.</P>
<P>Here I parted with my two good com|panions, who had travelled with me more than five hundred miles. Being nearly united together, we parted in true love. This I mention, becau&s;e the Lord loves a cheerful giver, and tho&s;e did, I thought, what they did, with great freedom and cheerfulne&s;s, not begrudging a little time, nor a little outward &s;ub&s;tance, for the &s;ake of the good cau&s;e of Truth. Tho&s;e will not lo&s;e their reward, for it is helping forward the work, as that of opening a door, and kindling a fire, is doing part

I had another companion, pro|videntially, I thought, provided here for me.</P>
<P>William Ferril, a public friend, hav|ing heard of my being in the country, had got him&s;elf ready again&s;t I came, and had freedom in the truth to travel with me, till I &s;hould fall in with another &s;uitable companion; which made my travels through tho&s;e lonely places much the ea&s;ier. When we left his hou&s;e, we &s;et our faces towards South-Carolina, having but one meeting of friends to take in the way, which was &s;ettled upon a ri|ver called Pee-Dee, about an hundred miles from the &s;aid friend's hou&s;e. This we accompli&s;hed in about two days. In the night we lodged in the woods. The few friends were truly glad to &s;ee us, they being &s;eldom vi&s;ited. We had comfort|able and refre&s;hing &s;ea&s;ons together, the Lord owning and favouring with his good pre&s;ence, &s;trengthened not only the inward, but the outward man al&s;o. Here I was &s;en&s;ibly affected with &s;uch a &s;eal and evidence of peace in my own mind,

that I was fully pur&s;uaded, I was in the way of my duty: it made me go on again very cheerfully.

There is now, as well as formerly, a little remnant, that, with my &s;oul, can &s;et their &s;eals to the truth of this; and can &s;ay unto him, We have lacked nothing, Lord!</P>
<P>Francis Clark, with whom we had quartered, bore us company one day and night in the woods. We thought &s;ome|times, we travelled near &s;ixty miles in a day; for when we had to lodge in the woods, we ro&s;e early, and lay down late. Our friend Clark returned home, leaving us to &s;hift for our&s;elves; but my compa|nion, having &s;ome knowledge of the way, &s;teered, I believe, a pretty &s;traight cour&s;e. When night came, we pitched our tent in a valley, where there was &s;ome gra&s;s, and a little brook of water. So when we had eaten &s;uch as our bags af|forded, and given our hor&s;es provender, and taken care of them, with what little we had, we lay our&s;elves down, and &s;lept

very &s;ound and comfortably, being wea|ried with riding.</P>
<P>Next morning we were &s;tirring by the time it was well light, and &s;oon being ready, mounted our hor&s;es; and it was well we did &s;o, for there came &s;uch a rain that day, that it rai&s;ed the creeks and rivers &s;o high, that if we had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ot got over them that night, we might have been &s;topped for &s;ome days. We travelled <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">il<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> late in the night, and coming to a hou&s;e, de&s;ired we might have lodgings; but the ma&s;ter of it told us, we could not. We a&s;ked him, how far it was to another hou&s;e, He &s;aid, it was but a mile, but there was a deep creek in the way, and he would not go with us, if we would give him a great deal of money. I then very earne&s;tly de&s;ired, that he would let us &s;tay in his hou&s;e all night, and we would pay him for his trouble, and for what we had; for we had rode almo&s;t all the day in the rain, and it was a very cold rainy night. He told us, he would not let us &s;tay there, and &s;o left us &s;tanding without his gate. But a young man &s;tanding by, &s;eeing and hearing what had pa&s;&s;ed, took pity on us, and &s;aid, though it was dangerous cro&s;&s;ing the waters, he would take his hor&s;e, and go with us which he did, and we got w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> rough,

But, bad as it was, I was glad and thankful we had not to lie out all night in the rain. I re&s;ted well, and in the morning was well both in body and mind.</P>
<P>The fourth of the week we got to the Wateree, where &s;everal friends from Ire|land had been &s;ettled about &s;ix or &s;even years. We had a meeting with them, and then, with S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters"> Milhou&s;e and my companion, I &s;et out <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">owards Charles|town. This took us mo&s;t of three days, it being one hundred and thirty miles. When we came there, we found but few &s;teady friends, yet we had &s;ome good opportunities togeth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r; &s;everal of the town's people al&s;o coming in. I tru&s;t our vi&s;it was of &s;ervice, and tended to edifi|cation, and &s;trengthening the two or three that dwell in that remote part of the world. However, I thought I &s;hould not be ea&s;y without paying them a vi&s;it, though I had to ride &s;o far on purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>When I felt my&s;elf clear, I returned with my friends to the Wateree, and was with them at their fir&s;t day meeting, and meeting for bu&s;ine&s;s. We had good op|portunities

likewi&s;e in their &s;everal fami|lies, which I thought would not ea&s;ily be forgotten. Then taking our leave of them in go&s;pel-love, in which we had paid them that vi&s;it, we returned to Pee-Dee, Samuel Milhou&s;e &s;till accompanying us. The friends there, though their cir|cum&s;tances in the world were but low, treated us very kindly. Their love to truth, and diligence in attending meet|ings, are worthy of notice; for they had nigh one hundred miles to go to the monthly meeting they belonged to, and I was informed very &s;eldom mi&s;&s;ed at|tending it.</P>
<P>Here my companion and I parted, he returning home, and I, with Francis Clark, went towards Cane-Creek. His company was &s;o agreeable, that time did not &s;eem long. When night came, we took up our lodgings in the woods, and got next day to a place called Deep-River, there being &s;everal families newly &s;ettled there, but they had not yet built a meet|ing-hou&s;e. We had a meeting at a friend's hou&s;e, and then proceeded to Cane-Creek, where there is a large body of friends gathered thither in a few years from the &s;everal provinces. They told me they had not been &s;ettled there above ten years, but had found occa&s;ion to build
<PB N="81" REF="018146_0081_0FA5615BB13248B8">
five meeting-hou&s;es, and then wanted one or two more. I had good and &s;ea&s;onable opportunities among them, being freely opened in the love of the go&s;pel, to de|clare the truth.</P>
<P>When I found my&s;elf ea&s;y to leave them, having had divers meetings, at Eno, and &s;everal other places, which, for brevity &s;ake, I forbear to mention; I with Jeremiah Pickitt then &s;et out to|wards Virginia, having nigh two hun|dred miles to travel, and had but one meeting in the way. We got to Robert Langley's on fir&s;t day evening, where I &s;taid to re&s;t and refre&s;h my&s;elf, after &s;o long and tedious a journey. I then pa&s;&s;|ed to Curls, and travelled through Vir|ginia, having vi&s;ited mo&s;t of the meet|ings before, and came into Maryland. I was at their yearly meeting held at We&s;t-River. It was very large, and in the &s;everal &s;ittings thereof over&s;hadowed with the wing of divine power, which tended to nouri&s;h the good part, and to the gathering and &s;ettling the minds of many upon the &s;ure foundation, and kept down that &s;pirit which would divide in Jacob, and &s;catter in I&s;rael.</P>
<P>We parted on fourth day in great love, &s;ome of us being nearly united in &s;pirit. For though many, by balking their te&s;ti|mony
<PB N="82" REF="018146_0082_0FA5615D30555E08">
again&s;t that antichri&s;tian yoke of tithes, and trading in negroes, have cau&s;ed the way of Truth to be evil &s;poken of; yet I was &s;en&s;ible that the regard of heaven was towards them, and the mer|ciful hand was &s;till &s;tretched out, even towards the unfaithful, and back&s;liders, that they might be gathered. I had a travel and exerci&s;e upon my &s;pirit for the cau&s;e of Truth, and that the great ble&s;&s;ed and everla&s;ting Name, which I with ma|ny more make a profe&s;&s;ion of, might not be di&s;honoured: the faithful are indeed as &s;takes in Sion, but they are but as one of a family, or two of a tribe.</P>
<P>I then took the meetings in my way to Penn&s;ylvania, as Elk-Ridge, Patap&s;co, and Patap&s;co-Fore&s;t, Little-Falls, Gun|powder, and &s;o to Deer-Creek, where our worthy friends John Churchman and his wife met me. We cro&s;&s;ed the river Su&s;quehannah into Penn&s;ylvania, and &s;o to their hou&s;e. Having had many pre|cious meetings in this journey, and well cleared my&s;elf of tho&s;e provinces, I was ea&s;y in my &s;pirit, and much comforted in the Lord, that he had been plea&s;ed thus far to help me through. I tarried one night at John Churchman's; and next day, being the &s;eventh of the week, was at New-Garden monthly meeting; on
<PB N="83" REF="018146_0083_0FA5615DED8A0520">
fir&s;t day at London-Grove, where there is a large gathering of friends. It was a good opportunity, truth favouring us, we were comforted together in the Lord. On the &s;econd day, the twenty-ninth of the fifth month, I got to Philadelphia, having in this journey travelled upwards of two thou&s;and eight hundred miles.</P>
<P>After my return from the &s;outhern provinces, I &s;taid &s;ome weeks vi&s;iting meetings, and &s;ome friends families, in and about Philadelphia; and was al&s;o in the Jer&s;eys vi&s;iting &s;everal meetings, and attended their quarterly meeting at Salem, which held three days for wor&s;hip and di&s;cipline. It was an edifying time, things being conducted in a degree of the pure wi&s;dom, and the over&s;hadowing of divine power was witne&s;&s;ed by many. Then, having duly waited for the moving and putting forth of the good Shepherd, who &s;aid, <Q>I put forth my &s;heep, and go be|fore them,</Q> I thought I felt a draft, and not only &s;o, but likewi&s;e true liber|ty, to vi&s;it New-England, which I had not done before. If I had, I &s;hould have proceeded, in order to &s;horten my jour|ney, for it was again&s;t mine own inclina|tion to &s;tay &s;o long in and about one place. Therefore I &s;et out the twenty-&s;ixth
<PB N="84" REF="018146_0084_0FA5615EAA665EC0">
of the &s;eventh month, I&s;aac Green|leaf accompanying me.</P>
<P>My fir&s;t &s;tep was to Wright's Town, where was held a general meeting for the county of Bucks. Then we cro&s;&s;ed Delaware into New-Jer&s;ey, and took meetings in our way to New-York, then to Flu&s;hing upon Long-I&s;land, and were at their monthly meeting. Then cro&s;&s;ing the Bay went to their quarterly meeting at Purcha&s;e. After this, we took &s;everal meetings, as they fell in our way towards Rhode-i&s;land. I then had Robert Willis for my companion, (a friend from the Jer&s;eys,) who had drawings in his mind that way. Many people came to our meetings in tho&s;e parts, which are not clo&s;ely joined in outward fellow&s;hip with us; yet are under the operation of the good hand, and in degree convinced of our principles. This, I thought, made our meetings more lively, and the &s;pring of the go&s;pel to flow more plentifully, to the watering the thir&s;ty ground.</P>
<P>When we had vi&s;ited the meetings hereabouts, and taken our leave of friends, we travelled through Connecticut govern|ment, having but one or two meetings in the way. The Pre&s;byterians, who formerly in tho&s;e parts were very rigid and bitter again&s;t friends, are now become
<PB N="85" REF="018146_0085_0FA5615F682DD3E0">
more loving, and treated us very kindly. I had great drawings of the Father's love towards them, believing his &s;ecret hand was at work to bring them from the barren mountains of their lifele&s;s pro|fe&s;&s;ion, to &s;erve the living God in new|ne&s;s of life. We came to Leice&s;ter, where there is a little handful that go under our name. We had a meeting with them on fir&s;t day, the twentieth of the eighth month. We were refre&s;hed together, being &s;trengthened in the God of our &s;alvation. Then we had a meet|ing at Bolton, about thirty miles from thence, where we met with Samuel Spa|vold, in his return towards Penn&s;ylvania, he having vi&s;ited mo&s;t of the meetings in New-England. We had a good &s;ea&s;on together. Then &s;aluting one another in that unity and fellow&s;hip which brethren and fellow-labourers ought to dwell in, we parted; and my companion and I went to Uxbridge, and had a meeting. Then to Mendam, where we tarried all night at Mo&s;es Aldrige's, and had a meeting next day; &s;o on to Wain&s;ockit, where we had a meeting. The weather being very hot, many people were nigh fainting; but prai&s;es be to the great Name, the meeting concluded well.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="018146_0086_0FA5616057950878">On fir&s;t day we were at Providence yearly meeting, which is only for wor&s;hip. It was very large, and tended to the ga|thering and &s;taying people's minds on Chri&s;t, the chief corner &s;tone, and rock of ages; for Truth had the dominion, and the Lord's power was felt. We had our outward entertainment at Stephen Hopkins's, then Governor of Rhode-I&s;land. He and his wife treated us with hearty kindne&s;s. We had meetings at Cran&s;ton, Warwick, and Ea&s;t-Green|wich, then upon Conanicut-I&s;land. We then cro&s;&s;ed the river, and came to New|port; and attended both their meetings on fir&s;t day, which were large; a great number re&s;iding thereabouts, who go un|der our name. But, with &s;orrow of heart may it be &s;aid, in the time of ea&s;e and plenty, many have taken their flight.</P>
<P>We left Newport on third day, and had a meeting at Port&s;mouth, in which we had good &s;ervice for Truth. Then cro&s;&s;ing the Bay, had a meeting at Free|town upon the main, in which we were favoured with the openings of Truth, and left them in peace. I took notice of a negro man, who was with us at &s;everal meetings, and by his own indu&s;try, with the help of &s;ome friends, had purcha&s;ed his freedom, that he might attend meet|ings;
<PB N="87" REF="018146_0087_0FA561630900D328">
having, for &s;ome time, been con|vinced of the ble&s;&s;ed Truth, which he much prized, and told me, as he had been obedient to the operation of it, which worketh by love, he found him|&s;elf engaged in his mind to exhort his fellow-creatures to come to the good prin|ciple in them&s;elves; that they, by yield|ing obedience, might know a being &s;aved by it; or to that effect. This I could not gain&s;ay, nor di&s;courage; but de&s;ired him to be faithful to the manife&s;tation of Truth in his own heart, and the mea&s;ure of Grace he had received. We parted in love and good will, being brethren of one Father.</P>
<P>Our next meeting was at Little Cran&s;|ton, after which I parte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> with &s;everal friends, in the unity of the one Spirit, which had brought us into nearne&s;s and fellow&s;hip with each other; they return|ing to their places of abode, and I with my companion, and a young man who accompanied us &s;everal weeks, &s;till kept forward. I was enabled to labour through the&s;e parts beyond all outward expectati|on; for though the meetings were large, by rea&s;on of great comings in of other people, I found that gracious promi&s;e fulfilled; <Q>As the day is, &s;o &s;hall thy &s;trength be.</Q> We were at Accoake&s;et.
<PB N="88" REF="018146_0088_0FA56165C0C5CCB8">
New-Town, and Dartmouth or Aponi|gan&s;et, and had a meeting at each place. The la&s;t meeting, I thought, did not con&s;i&s;t of le&s;s than eight hundred people. We had at Cu&s;hnett, Roche&s;ter, Taun|ton, and Freetown, many living and good opportunities to declare Truth in the free extendings of Go&s;pel-love; al&s;o at Swan|&s;ey, on a fir&s;t day, had a &s;atisfactory op|portunity. Whil&s;t we were vi&s;iting tho&s;e places, we took up our quarters at Paul O&s;bourn's, who often accompanied us from one meeting to another, his heart being free and open towards his friends, and to &s;erve Truth.</P>
<P>Having well cleared our&s;elves, we went tow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rds the yearly meetings at Bo&s;ton, Lynn, and Salem, the twenty-&s;econd of the ninth month. They began at Bo&s;ton. I do not remember I had &s;een &s;o much &s;tillne&s;s and gravity in &s;o great an a&s;&s;em|bly, as I ob&s;erved there. It con&s;i&s;ted of people of different per&s;ua&s;ions. We have great cau&s;e to bow, in humble thank|fulne&s;s, to the God of all our mercies, that he hath been plea&s;ed to make way for his people, to enjoy their religious meetings without the lea&s;t mole&s;tation, in this and many other places, where our worthy friends formerly &s;uffered &s;ore per|&s;ecution, by long impri&s;onment, griev|ous

whippings, &s;poiling of goods, and &s;ome of them laid down their lives for the te&s;timony of a good con&s;cience: and though our God be a gracious, merciful, and long-&s;uffering God, yet he will take vengeance on all the workers of iniquity, and the day of his wrath will break forth like a con&s;uming fire, in a time when it is not looked for. As he &s;aid, &s;o he will do; "For," &s;aid he, <Q>I am a jealous God, vi&s;iting the &s;ins of the fathers upon the children, unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me; and &s;hewing mercy unto thou|&s;ands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.</Q> So it is plain the Lord is equal in all his ways: for, concerning tho&s;e that are the offspring of that hard-hearted, wicked, and perver&s;e generation, that per&s;ecuted and &s;hed the blood of the innocent &s;ervants of the Lord, if they do but turn to him with their whole hearts, &s;o as to love him, and keep his commandments, they will &s;urely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">d mercy: but, if they continue in a &s;tate of rebellion, and hardne&s;s of heart, and &s;in again&s;t his light and good &s;pirit in their hearts, as did their fore-fathers, he will vi&s;it them with his judgments for their iniquities; and for the &s;ins which they and their fore-fathers have commit|ted,

he will pour forth the cup of his in|dignation without mixture.</P>
<P>After tho&s;e yearly meetings, we, with &s;everal friends, went towards the yearly meeting at Dover, and Cachecy, taking &s;everal meetings in the way, as at Ip&s;|wich, where no friends lived; but we got leave to have a meeting in their court|hou&s;e. It was di&s;turbed by a man &s;tand|ing up, when I was in te&s;timony who &s;aid, that I &s;truck at the foundation of their principles. He was a very hot man, and held the doctrine of ab&s;olute prede&s;|tination. I told him, Truth &s;truck at the un&s;ound foundation; but, as he was in heat and anger, not fit to di&s;pute about religious matters, he &s;at down, and a wo|man &s;harply reproved him for his rude behaviour, &s;he being grieved that the meeting &s;hould be di&s;turbed; for it was in a good frame. Several of the people, I believe, were a&s;hamed of his conduct. After a little &s;ilence, a friend &s;tood up, and had a good opportunity. Then I had to clear my&s;elf of what was upon my mind, and the people being &s;till and at|tentive, the meeting concluded well. The man who had oppo&s;ed me &s;hrunk away, and I &s;aw him no more, though I looked for him, and in coolne&s;s thought to have had a little further di&s;cour&s;e with

him. That night we went to Newberry, where we had a meeting, much to my comfort and &s;atisfaction. We had meet|ings al&s;o at Ame&s;bury, Hampton, and Dover. Friends had been &s;orely wound|ed and &s;cattered in their minds hereaway, by an un&s;table &s;pirit. Tho&s;e yearly ga|therings were large, and I hope tended to the honour of Truth. We went next to Barwick, and had &s;everal meetings there; travelled through the woods to Ca&s;co, where we had an opportunity with friends, and &s;uch as attend their meet|ings.</P>
<P>We cro&s;&s;ed the Bay to Small Point, and in our return had a meeting upon a neck of land called Meryconeague. The meeting at Small Point was the northermo&s;t &s;ettlement of friends upon the continent. We returned by Bo&s;ton, having &s;everal meetings in our way; and from thence to Pembroke, Sandwich, Yarmouth upon Cape Cod, Suckane&s;&s;it, Wood's Hole, and thence took pa&s;&s;age to Nantucket. We &s;taid upon that i&s;land about a week, vi&s;iting friends in their families, and had &s;everal public meetings with them.

becau&s;e I thought the root of bitterne&s;s was not removed, though I was com|forted in &s;everal meetings among them with the &s;hedding abroad of divine favour, which &s;trengthened me in the di&s;charge of my duty; and indeed there is a living remnant &s;till among them, which I cha|ritably hoped would be pre&s;erved in the innocency and &s;implicity of the un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hang|able Truth. Several Indians were there, natives of the i&s;land. I had a de&s;ire to have a meeting among them, and ac|quainted them with it, which they freely con&s;ented to; and at the time appointed their prie&s;t was waiting for us, with his meeting-hou&s;e doors open, and &s;aid, he would have me go up into the place where he u&s;ed to preach. I told him, I cho&s;e to fit below with my friends. I had a living open time among them, to &s;et forth the nece&s;&s;ity there was for them to turn their minds to the grace of God in their own hearts, a mea&s;ure whereof they, as well as others, had received, according to the apo&s;tle's doctrine; which, if they gave good heed unto, and yielded obe|dience, according to the manife&s;tation thereof, would bring &s;alvation. The meeting ended in prayer and prai&s;es to Almighty God for his great mercy and loving-kindne&s;s to mankind, in &s;ending
<PB N="93" REF="018146_0093_0FA5616AB5555200">
his Son to be a light to enlighten the Gentiles, and for his &s;alvation to the ends of the earth. Solidity appeared in their countenances, and they behaved with &s;obriety, very becoming the occa&s;ion of our a&s;&s;embling together. I &s;hould be glad there was more of it to be &s;een. among tho&s;e that profe&s;s Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>We parted with them in the love of the Go&s;pel, which I felt in my heart to|wards them. The wind coming fair&punc; we took our leave of friends, and went on board a ve&s;&s;el, a friend named William Hu&s;&s;ey being ma&s;ter. In the evening of the &s;ame day we landed upon an i&s;land called Marthas Vineyard. We quartered at a man's hou&s;e that called him&s;elf by our name, and I thought he had &s;ome zeal for Truth, and the promotion of it; for after he under&s;tood we had a de&s;ire to have a meeting, he ha&s;tened and cal|led in his neighbours, and a &s;olid good time we had together.</P>
<P>The next morning, being favoured with a fair wind, we cro&s;&s;ed the Sound to Dartmouth, and landed nigh the meet|ing-hou&s;e, where we met with &s;everal friends, who had attended the quarterly meeting. The meeting ended that day, we had a confirming &s;weet opportunity together, in waiting upon the Lord be|fore
<PB N="94" REF="018146_0094_0FA5616B692416D8">
we parted with them, and tho&s;e that came from Nantucket. Next day we got to Freetown and in the evening had a good opportunity at the hou&s;e of Abra|ham Barker with the friends that lived thereabouts. To this meeting came the negro man I mentioned before. He told me he had been vi&s;iting; &s;ome of his own colour, and was returning to Newport, where he lived; but in his way he &s;aid, he thought he mu&s;t go by Abraham Bar|ker's, though out of his way, not know|ing we were come from Nantucket. When he &s;aw us, he &s;eemed to be almo&s;t overcome with joy, and was of &s;ervice to us; for we wanted to &s;end &s;omebody over the Bay, either that night, or early next morning, to appoint a meeting for us at Port&s;mouth upon the i&s;land; and none readier and more willing than poor Cae&s;ar; for he was &s;tirring &s;o &s;oon in the morning, that he gave full notice up and down the i&s;land. So we had a large ga|thering collected in due time, though the time to give notice in was &s;o &s;hort, and &s;ea&s;onable advice was handed forth. From thence we went to Newport with our friend Thomas Richard&s;on, with whom we had lodged when there before, and were at their monthly meeting; we &s;taid with them al&s;o on fir&s;t day. Our
<PB N="95" REF="018146_0095_0FA5616C386A3708">
meetings were richly favoured with the free extendings of divine power and wi&s;|dom; &s;o that I was truly thankful I had been helped to get through the various difficult paths I had to tread in this un|&s;table part of the world.</P>
<P>On &s;econd day we left Newport, and cro&s;&s;ed the river to Conannicut I&s;land, where a meeting was appointed for us; wherein we were well refre&s;hed together, and the conclu&s;ion was in prayer and &s;up|plication for each other's growth, pre&s;er|vation, and e&s;tabli&s;hment in the ble&s;&s;ed Truth. We here parted with &s;ome friends of Rhode-I&s;land, under a &s;en&s;e of divine favour, and in the uniting love of the Go&s;pel, which had cau&s;ed us to be near one unto another. Then cro&s;&s;ing the river upon the main land, we had meetings at Kingwood, Peries, Richmond, and Hopkinton, and &s;o pa&s;&s;ed through Naragan&s;et, till we came to We&s;terby Lower, the la&s;t meeting in tho&s;e parts we had to vi&s;it. We took our leave of tho&s;e friends that accompanied us in great good will; then travelled through the lower part of Connecticut government, cro&s;&s;ing many rivers, and the weather extreme cold. It was hard for me to bear; but prai&s;es be to the great Name, I was pre|&s;erved
<PB N="96" REF="018146_0096_0FA5616D1EF504B0">
in health, and my natural &s;trength did not at all fail.</P>
<P>When we had travelled hard about three days, we came again among friends; and on &s;ixth day had a meeting at Ino|marance. It was to me a good time; for the bread that refre&s;heth the hungry &s;oul was broken. We then cro&s;&s;ed over to Long-I&s;land, and were at the meeting at Flu&s;hing on fir&s;t day, the twentieth of the eleventh month. On third day we had a meeting at Cow-neck; on fourth day at We&s;tbury. Lukewarmne&s;s and indifference had much prevailed in many places among the profe&s;&s;ors of Truth. I had often to bear my te&s;timony for the ble&s;&s;ed Truth again&s;t earthly-mindedne&s;s, and all the deceitful and fal&s;e coverings of the fle&s;h, which had been the cau&s;e of it. I returned back to Flu&s;hing, in order to be at their quarterly meeting, which began on &s;eventh day for mini&s;ters and elders. It was attended with a degree of divine favour, to the comforting of our &s;ouls. Tho&s;e meetings were mea&s;urably ble&s;&s;ed with the pre&s;ence of the great and good Ma&s;ter of our a&s;&s;emblies, and his voice was heard by &s;ome, to &s;peak as ne|ver man &s;pake; and we had to conclude in humble &s;upplication to him for his help, and the continuation of his mercy, in
<PB N="97" REF="018146_0097_0FA5616EAB121F80">
vi&s;iting and turning the hearts of his peo|ple to him&s;elf. I then vi&s;ited the meet|ings upon the i&s;land, which I had not yet been at, and had meetings at Rockway, and again at We&s;tbury monthly meeting, where I was clo&s;ely exerci&s;ed on Truth's account; but was helped to clear my&s;elf of what lay upon my mind, and came away ea&s;y.</P>
<P>I then went to Bethphage, and had meetings al&s;o at Sickatauge and Oy&s;ter|bay, where there had been a large meet|ing, but now much declined; yet we had a large meeting, accompanied with Divine Power, to my great comfort. On fir&s;t day I was at Jericho. The meet|ing con&s;i&s;ted of &s;everal hundreds of people, who heard the Truth declared with great attention, the power of it be|ing over all, to the prai&s;e of I&s;rael's God. Pa&s;&s;ing through New-York, I &s;taid their meeting; then cro&s;&s;ed over by way of Staten-I&s;land, to Rahway in Ea&s;t-Jer&s;ey, where I had a meeting with friends, and &s;ome others, that came in, to the edifi|cation and comfort of &s;everal, my&s;elf in particular; being therein &s;trengthened and encouraged to go forward in the fu|ture &s;ervice I might be engaged in. We lodged at Jo&s;eph Shotwell's, and on &s;ixth day had a meeting at Plainfield. It was
<PB N="98" REF="018146_0098_0FA56070EC330488">
but &s;mall, by rea&s;on of &s;hort notice, yet favoured with the over&s;hadowings of di|vine favour; for which our &s;ouls were inwardly bowed to the Father of all our mercies.</P>
<P>I rode to Whitpiny on &s;eventh day to the quarterly meeting, which began on fir&s;t day. It was a good &s;atisfactory time with us. I &s;taid there on &s;econd day, and was at the preparative meeting, which was &s;atisfactory, divers things being opened and delivered in the pure wi&s;dom concerning the things of God, and the good order e&s;tabli&s;hed in his church. I had &s;ome good &s;ea&s;onable opportunities in &s;ome friends families; and on third day had a meeting at Rahway appoint|ed for tho&s;e of other &s;ocieties; which was to good &s;atisfaction. On fourth day we went to the Great Meadows, where we had a meeting with the friends there, among&s;t whom is a living remnant. We were made to rejoice together, in a true &s;en&s;e of the &s;hedding abroad of Divine Love in our hearts. On fifth day I went to Kingwood monthly meeting. I had &s;ome &s;ervice there for Truth, in recom|mending to the good order of the Go&s;|pel in each branch of our Chri&s;tian di&s;|cipline; which I ob&s;erved to be much wanting among them. On &s;ixth day I
<PB N="99" REF="018146_0099_0FA56071DB72C390">
had a meeting at Amwell, at the hou&s;e of Ger&s;hom Motts. It was an open time, Truth in a good degree prevailing. On fir&s;t day had a meeting at Cro&s;wick's; a clo&s;e &s;earching t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e it was, many &s;tates being opened in the love of the Go&s;pel. On &s;econd day I was at a meeting at Free|hold, in which I was largely opened in the free extendings of divine favour. On third day, the nineteenth of the twelfth month, I had a meeting at Upper-Spring|field. I was led to the &s;tates of the peo|ple in a clo&s;e manner, and the meeting ended well. On fourth day I had a meet|ing at Old-Springfield. It was an edify|ing and good meeting, Truth having the dominion, to the prai&s;e of I&s;rael's God. On fifth day I went to Little Egg-Har|bour, and had a meeting there next day, in which I was enabled to clear my&s;elf in a good degree, and came away ea&s;y.</P>
<P>We cro&s;&s;ed the river in the evening to Great Egg-Harbour. The weather being very cold, and having much ice, our journey was attended with &s;ome dif|ficulty; but we got well over the river, though in the night, to Great Egg-Har|bour, and lodged at Robert Smith's, an ancient friend, who, with his wife, en|tertained us very kindly. We had a meeting there on &s;eventh day, held at a
<PB N="100" REF="018146_0100_0FA560726B4911E8">
friend's hou&s;e, by rea&s;on of the extreme cold &s;ea&s;on. We had a &s;olemn comfort|able time together, and after meeting rode to the other meeting, along the Bay &s;hore, towards Cape-May, which was on fir&s;t day, the twenty-fourth of the twelfth month 1758. It was a clo&s;e exerci&s;ing time with me. The fro&s;t was &s;o &s;harp, we could not cro&s;s the Bay to Cape-May, but were obliged to ride round to a bridge, where we cro&s;&s;ed the river; which was about forty miles out of the way, and being &s;trangers to the road, we met with much difficulty through the woods, and there was no beaten path to be &s;een for &s;ome miles. I &s;aw that the friend, who pretended to be our guide, was going wrong, and told him, if we took that cour&s;e, it would lead us much out of the way; for I was very unea&s;y, Upon which he took out his compa&s;s, and finding it &s;o, altered his cour&s;e to that which I thought lay towards the road. I then found my mind quite ea&s;y, and &s;aid, I thought we &s;hould &s;oon find it, which &s;o happened. I &s;aid not much to the friends, but was thankful to the Lord, to find he was plea&s;ed to draw my mind towards the way we wanted to go.</P>
<P>Night coming on, with much rain, we lodged at a tavern, and next morning got
<PB N="101" REF="018146_0101_0FA56075C6732750">
to William Town&s;end's, where we had two meetings to pretty good &s;atisfaction. On &s;eventh day we rode about forty miles to John Reeves at Greenwich, were at the meeting on fir&s;t day, the thirty-fir&s;t of the twelfth month, and had good &s;ervice for Truth. In that place there is a promi&s;ing appearance, among the youth, of the pro&s;perity of Truth. Second day, the fir&s;t of the fir&s;t month, we had a meet|ing at Alloway's Creek, which was at|tended with good; I being helped be|yond my own expectation. On third day I had a meeting at the head of Alloway's Creek, where I was led to &s;everal &s;tates in a clo&s;e manner, and came away much refre&s;hed in the Lord: prai&s;es be to his great Name for evermore! I had a meet|ing at Salem on fourth day, there being a marriage, and the new wine was hand|ed forth, which made &s;everal rejoice un|der a &s;eme of divine favour communicat|ed unto our &s;ouls. On fifth day I had a meeting at Pile's Grove. It was large, &s;everal of other &s;ocieties being there, I was opened in the free extendings of Go&s;pel love to their &s;ouls. It was a good time to many, magnified be the God of our &s;alvation! On &s;ixth day I had a meet|ing at Woodbury, which was a &s;olid good time.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="018146_0102_0FA56077215BB028">The &s;ixth of the fir&s;t month I went to Haddonfield, and lodged at the widow Ea&s;taugh's, where I was very kindly en|tertained. On fir&s;t day I went to Eve&s;|ham meeting, where I had been before, and had &s;ervice for Truth in the love of the Go&s;pel. Haddonfield monthly meet|ing being on &s;econd day, I &s;taid there, and had an exerci&s;e on my mind for the honour, promotion, and pro&s;perity of the ble&s;&s;ed Truth, and that all might act in the wi&s;dom, power, and life, and might know &s;elf kept down by the power. I rejoiced I was at this meeting, Truth fa|vouring, and the Lord's power being over all. I was made thankful in my heart to the great Author from whence all our ble&s;&s;ings flow.</P>
<P>I want to Philadelphia on third day, but finding my mind drawn towards the Ea&s;tern &s;hore of Maryland, I &s;et out again on fifth day, the eleventh of the fir&s;t month, and reached Wilmington that night. I lodged at William Shipley's, when at Wilmington, and having &s;een his wife Elizabeth, when in Old England, in the &s;ervice of Truth, the remembrance of which had often been revived upon my mind, as believing her to be a mother in I&s;rael, and a &s;anctified ve&s;&s;el fitted for the ma&s;ter's u&s;e, I could not but rejoice to &s;ee

her again, and find her alive in the Truth, now in her declining years. Our next meeting was at the head of Sa&s;&s;afra&s;s. It was a hard time with me the fore part of the meeting; yet I came away well &s;atisfied, Truth favouring towards the conclu&s;ion, to the honour and prai&s;e of I&s;rael's God. After meeting I went home with Jo&s;hua Van&s;ant's, where I lodged.</P>
<P>The next meeting was at Cecil. I was was exceeding poor and low, and deeply exerci&s;ed in my mind, but was helped over all, and beyond all thought and ex|pection of my own; for I think, I may &s;ay in &s;incerity, I had no tru&s;t nor confi|dence, &s;ave in the Lord alone, who hi|therto hath been my rock, and my &s;trong tower, my &s;ure helper in every needful time. May I, with all mine, put our tru&s;t in him, hath often been the earne&s;t prayer and &s;upplication of my &s;oul. I had a meeting at Queen Ann's, which ended well, the Lord's power being felt among us, to our comfort. I lodged at &mdash; Furner's, where we had a meet|ing with the family, and &s;everal others who came in&punc; I hope it might tend in &s;ome degree to &s;tir up the carele&s;s, and warn the unfaithful. The twenty-fir&s;t of the fir&s;t month I had a meeting at Tuck|ahoa.
<PB N="104" REF="018146_0104_0FA5607868A66EE0">
It was &s;mall, but attended with good, the Lord favouring us with his pre&s;ence, according to his gracious pro|mi&s;e.</P>
<P>On fir&s;t day I cro&s;&s;ed Choptank-River over to Mar&s;hy Creek, and was at their meeting. I was much comforted, and had peace in the di&s;charge of what I be|lieved to be my duty; though I travelled in great fear, and much weakne&s;s at times. I was at Choptank meeting on &s;econd day, which was &s;ilent; yet I came away ea&s;y, with &s;weetne&s;s upon my mind, having been &s;trenthened in my &s;ilent wait|ing. I had a meeting on third day at the Third-Haven, where I was &s;en&s;ibly af|fected with the &s;tates of tho&s;e that were not willing to take up the cro&s;s to their corrupt wills and inclinations; and had to bear te&s;timony again&s;t unfaithfulne&s;s, di&s;obedience, truth-breakers, and &s;uch as brought di&s;honour upon the Truth, and our holy profe&s;&s;ion. I felt the love of the Go&s;pel flow freely, even towards the back&s;liders; and in it warning them, I came away &s;weetly comforted in my &s;pirit. Fourth day I went to the Bay &s;ide, where we had a meeting on fifth day, with a few lukewarm profe&s;&s;ors. I had to exhort them to more diligence in keeping up their meetings, and waiting therein, that

they might know the renewing of &s;trength in the Lord, and be enabled to wor&s;hip him (as he is a Spirit) in Spirit and in Truth. On &s;eventh day I was at the quarterly meeting of mini&s;ters and elders at Third Haven, where I had &s;ome &s;er|vice for Truth. On fir&s;t day I was again at Tuckahoa meeting, Truth favouring, in the love of the Go&s;pel, many divine truths were opened to the edification and comfort of our &s;ouls; and ended in hum|ble &s;upplication and prayer to Almighty God for his help, &s;trength, and pre&s;erva|tion in the way of truth and righteou&s;|ne&s;s. On third day I was at Third-Ha|ven, at the quarterly meeting, where &s;e|veral friends had good &s;ervice for the Truth, in the love of which we were comforted together in the Lord, and helped to bear te&s;timony again&s;t tho&s;e things which are crept in by rea&s;on of unfaithfulne&s;s among the profe&s;&s;ors of Truth. On fourth day, the thirty-fir&s;t of the fir&s;t month, I, with &s;everal friends, went towards Lewis-Town. On &s;ixth day had a meeting at Cold-Spring, where is a poor company of indifferent luke|warm profe&s;&s;ors. On &s;eventh day I had a meeting at Motherkiln, which was pretty large, and attended with the

<P>I was at Little-Creek on fir&s;t day, where we were comforted together in the Lord. Here is a promi&s;ing pro|&s;pect among the young people of the pro&s;perity of Truth. I was at Duck-Creek meeting on &s;econd day, which was &s;mall, yet a living open time to &s;e|veral. Thence I pa&s;&s;ed to George's Creek, where I had a meeting; and &s;o to Wilmington, where I met with Samuel Spavold, who embarked for England on fifth day, the eighth of the &s;econd month 1759. I &s;taid the monthly meeting, which was that day, in which I was large|ly opened to the &s;tates of &s;everal, things being much out of order, by rea&s;on of a difference which had happened among them. I came away I thought clear, and ea&s;y in my mind.

On fir&s;t day I was at Kennet, and had large openings to the people, in the free extendings of the line of Truth's way. On &s;econd day was again at Concord quarterly meeting for wor&s;hip and di&s;cipline, in which Truth's te&s;timony went forth again&s;t di&s;|orderly

gain&s;ayers, and libertine &s;pirits. I had a word of comfort and con&s;olation al&s;o to the weak feeble mourners in Zion. Things clo&s;ed well, and we parted re|fre&s;hed in the Lord. On third day I was at a meeting at Providence, held for young people chiefly; it was to good &s;atisfaction, and ended well. On fourth day, the fourteenth of the &s;econd month, I had a meeting at Birmingham. I felt the Lord was with us, helping and mak|ing way by his own power; prai&s;es be to his great Name for ever!</P>
<P>After meeting, we cro&s;&s;ed the river called Brandywine, and went to my kind friend William Harvey's, where I was kindly entertained. On fifth day, the fifteenth of the &s;econd month, I had a meeting at Center, in New ca&s;tle county. I was glad and thankful in my mind, to feel my&s;elf fully given up to what the good hand was plea&s;ed to give forth, ei|ther to &s;peak, or be &s;ilent. On &s;ixth day I had a meeting at Hocke&s;&s;on, which was pretty large, and in degree favoured; yet could not &s;ay I rejoiced, for in that place I felt the &s;eed &s;uffered, as well as in many other places, where my lot hath been ca&s;t of late; e&s;pecially among the elders, and tho&s;e that &s;hould be the fore|mo&s;t rank in religion.

We had al&s;o a comfortable and confirming time together on third day, at our farewell meeting, which being a fre&s;h &s;eal of the Father's love, and continued regard for his church and people, in uniting and making us to rejoice together in him, it will remain, I hope, upon many minds, with gratitude to the great Giver of every good gift.</P>

Hence I went to We&s;t-Caln, and lodged at George Singular's, and was at the meeting on fourth day, the twenty-fir&s;t of the &s;econd month.

I was much exerci&s;ed to recommend to an in|ward waiting, which by many profe&s;&s;ors is much neglected. Our next meeting was at Exeter. On fifth day we had a meeting at Reading, and afterward went to Maiden-Creek. At Reading our meet|ing was in the town-hou&s;e, or court|hou&s;e, where &s;everal &s;oldiers came, and many of the town's people, who behaved very &s;oberly; the good power of Truth coming over all, and prevailing, many minds were humbled and brought low. It was a good time, e&s;pecially to &s;ome of the &s;oldiers, who were reached by the invi&s;ible power of Truth. The meeting ended in prai&s;es and thankfulne&s;s to the Almighty, for his un&s;peakable favours; who is over all, worthy for evermore!</P>
<P>After meeting we went to Maiden-Creek, where we had a meeting on &s;ixth day. It was large, and to tolerable good &s;atisfaction. We lodged at Mo&s;es Star's. On fir&s;t day we had a meeting at the Great Swamp. It was a living &s;atisfactory time to &s;everal; and, in general, an edi|fying &s;ea&s;on.

<P>Here is a large body of people in this province of Penn&s;ylvania, the elders of which are too much in the outward court, which is only trodden by the Gentiles, or &s;uch as are in the &s;pirit of the world; yet a young and ri&s;ing generation is here, as well as in &s;everal other places where my lot hath been ca&s;t, &s;ince I came into this land, whom the Lord hath vi&s;ited by his power and good Spirit in their hearts, which, as they take good heed in yield|ing obedience to, and bring all things into the obedience of Chri&s;t, will crucify all their inordinate de&s;ires, evil thoughts, and imaginations, and enable them to bring forth the fruits of the Spirit, which are love, joy, peace, gentlene&s;s, meek|ne&s;s, long-&s;uffering, and goodne&s;s: again&s;t the&s;e there is no law.

<P>I was at Wright's Town on fourth day. It was an exerci&s;ing and low time with me, but I tru&s;t Truth did not &s;uffer on my account. On fifth day I was at Make|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">d. It was a living and precious time with us in the meeting, Truth's power prevailing to the dividing the word aright.

I had a meeting at the Falls on &s;ixth day, to &s;olid &s;atisfaction; and afterwards rode to Bri&s;tol, and had a meeting on &s;eventh day, the 10th of the third month. I was glad Truth in &s;ome good degree had the dominion. I &s;taid the meeting on fir&s;t day, the eleventh of the third month.

This was a good time to us; the Lord's power was over all, to the prai&s;e of his own great Name!</P>
<P>On &s;econd day I had a meeting at Abington, in which I was favoured with the openings of Truth, in the &s;pring of the Go&s;pel, to the exhorting all to faith|fulne&s;s, even the rebellious, and gain|&s;ayers; that they might come to know &s;alvation to their &s;ouls through Chri&s;t. My next meeting was at Hor&s;ham, which was large; in which Truth favouring, it was made a precious time to many, as I then felt. On fourth day I had a meeting at Gwynedd or North-Wales, where there is a pretty large body of friends; the fight of whom, in many places, and the &s;en&s;e of divine favour &s;till extended towards them, was cau&s;e of hun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> thankfulne&s;s. On fifth day, the fifteenth of the third month, I got to Philadelphia, having in this vi&s;it been ab&s;ent from thence about nine weeks. I made my home, whil&s;t there, with the widow Rachel Pemberton and her &s;on John, worthy friends; &s;he a mother in I&s;rael, and a great care-taker of the poor &s;ervants who have been &s;ent, not only in opening the door, and kin|dling the fire, but in mini&s;tring every thing that &s;he thought might be a help

<P>The thirty-fir&s;t of the third month I left Philadelphia again, in order to vi&s;it a few meetings in Che&s;ter county which I had not yet been at. On fir&s;t day I was at Providence meeting, which was a good and &s;atisfactory opportunity, the &s;tate of things much opened, and our minds in a good degree humbled, under a lively &s;en&s;e of divine favour. I was at Concord on &s;econd day. John Churchman al&s;o being there, was very helpful to &s;ettle the minds of &s;ome, who had gone into jangling about &s;ome things which had happened among them. This being their monthly meeting, we left them to appear|ance in a pretty quiet frame of mind, and things ended well. After meeting I rode towards Haverford, and on third day was at Haverford meeting, which was well. On fourth day I was at Darby meeting. It was an exerci&s;ing time to me, things being much out of order, &s;ome differing in their judgment concern|ing what was, and what was not, con|&s;i&s;tent

<P>On fifth day, the fifth of the fourth month, I was at Springfield. It was a large good &s;ea&s;onable opportunity to ma|ny. On &s;ixth day I was at Newtown meeting; in which Truth's way was largely opened, and livingly &s;et forth in the power of it, to the humbling, and &s;olid &s;atisfaction of many: a day to be remembered by the &s;en&s;ible. After meeting I went to George Miller's, where I had been before; a very kind friend. On fir&s;t day I was at Middletown meet|ing. It was a large gathering, and Truth had the dominion over all; though many dry profe&s;&s;ors were li&s;tening and longing after words, which &s;ometimes hath cau&s;ed the living &s;tream to be withheld for a &s;ea|&s;on; yet the great goodne&s;s and conde|&s;cen&s;ion of a merciful God is wonderful, in that he is plea&s;ed to cau&s;e the living &s;tream of the go&s;pel mini&s;try to i&s;&s;ue and break forth in a wonderful manner, to

<P>I had an evening meeting at the &s;chool-hou&s;e; it al&s;o was an opportunity of good to our &s;ouls, which were refre&s;hed toge|ther in the Lord. I&s;aac Greenleaf of Philadelphia being with me, on &s;econd day, we were at Go&s;hen meeting, which was attended with good; Truth in &s;ome good degree favouring. We lodged at Aaron A&s;hbridge's, and on third day had a meeting at Bradford. We were much hindered in our way by the waters being much out, and a friend was in great dan|ger of being carried away, but was pre|&s;erved. We got to meeting, though friends had been gathered an hour, or more. It proved a good &s;ea&s;on; the Lord had companion on us, and cau&s;ed his Go&s;pel rain to de&s;cend on the thir&s;ty ground, to the refre&s;hing of that which was of his own right hand planting, and al&s;o to the placing judgment upon the un|righteous part, and all the fruits thereof. I came away thankful in my &s;pirit to the Lord, for his great goodne&s;s to his poor people; becau&s;e I &s;aw his mercy and lov|ing-kindne&s;s endure for ever.</P>
<P>On fourth day we had a meeting at the Great Valley, in which I perceived

After meeting we went to a friend's hou&s;e, with whom Margaret Ellis abides, and were at Radnor meet|ing on fifth day, the twelfth of the fourth month; in which, though I was attend|ed with much weakne&s;s, I thought I had &s;ome &s;ervice for Truth. On &s;ixth day I had a meeting at Merrion, which was not an unprofitable &s;ea&s;on, I tru&s;t, to &s;everal. I returned that day to Philadelphia, and on &s;eventh day, with John Pemberton, I rode to Plymouth, and was at that meet|ing. On fir&s;t and &s;econd day at New-Providence. On third day returned again to Philadelphia, with &s;ome degree of &s;a|tisfaction, and attended their week-day meeting, there being a marriage.

in cour&s;e, and al&s;o paid &s;everal religious vi&s;its to families, as I fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd my mind drawn in the movings of Truth: in all which &s;ervice, though but &s;mall in com|pari&s;on of &s;ome others, I found my &s;pirit favoured with &s;weetne&s;s, and a degree of peace. Whil&s;t I waited here, &s;uppo&s;ing my &s;ervice to be mo&s;tly over upon the continent, having paid a general vi&s;it, I unexpectedly, and pretty &s;uddenly, felt a &s;trong draught towards Barbadoes, or the We&s;t-India I&s;lands. I acquainted friends therewith, and made &s;ome e&s;&s;ay for a pa&s;&s;age, yet &s;aw not my way quite clear; but in waiting felt my way open towards the Jer&s;eys, and on the twelfth of the fifth month I, with John Pem|berton, went to Mount-Holly, and was at the two-weeks meeting on fir&s;t day: and on &s;econd day at More's-Town, where a meeting was appointed for two friends, who were on their way towards Salem yearly meeting, where I was al&s;o with them. On third day John Pemberton left me at Ancocas, which meeting was in a good degree &s;atisfactory, and al&s;o to the honour of Truth, the edification of the Lord's people, and the prai&s;e of his great Name! On third day evening I came to my worthy and well-e&s;teemed friend Elizabeth Ea&s;taugh's, where I

lodged. On fourth day I was at a meet|ing at Haddonfield; on fifth day at Wood|bury; &s;ixth day at Solomon Lippincot's; &s;eventh day at Piles-Grove. All the&s;e meetings, I thought, had a good tenden|cy to the edification of the churches, and ended well. Thank&s;giving and prai&s;e be to him that lives and abides for ever|more!</P>
<P>The nineteenth of the fifth month 1759, the yearly meeting for wor&s;hip at Salem began, where we were much comforted together, in the enjoyment of divine goodne&s;s. The free extendings of the Go&s;pel-&s;pring flowed plentifully, to the watering the heritage of God; the &s;en&s;e whereof bowed many with humble reve|rence, in prai&s;es to his great and everla&s;t|ing Name, who is worthy for ever! The twenty-fifth we had a meeting at Eve&s;|ham, and went next day to Mount-Holly, where al&s;o we had a meeting; on &s;eventh day to Cro&s;wicks, where their quarterly meeting began for mini&s;ters and elders. On fir&s;t day I was at Bordentown in the fore part of the day, and at Tren<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on in the evening; at which meetings we were mea&s;urably comforted. On &s;econd day I was at Cro&s;wicks again, at the meetings for wor&s;hip and di&s;cipline, wherein Truth favoured us in a good degree. On third
<PB N="121" REF="018146_0121_0FA560892E694190">
day the meeting was very large, and I was deeply engaged for the honour of Truth's cau&s;e, there being a loo&s;e liber|tine &s;pirit among&s;t &s;ome who go under the name of friends, yet never came under the yoke of Chri&s;t, to know the deeds of the body to be mortified; but live at ea&s;e in the gratification of their heart's lu&s;ts, and cau&s;e the way of Truth to be evil &s;poken of. My concern was chiefly to &s;uch as live at ea&s;e in Zion, and to the back&s;liders in I&s;rael, yet I had a word of comfort to the mourners in Zion, and the heavy-hearted in Jeru&s;alem, that they might hold on their way. I was glad of &s;o &s;ea&s;onable an opportunity, wherein I was led to &s;peak &s;o clo&s;ely to the &s;tates of many, in true Go&s;pel-love, which was as a &s;eal of divine favour.</P>
<P>Upon our taking leave of each other, we committed one another to the Lord, and parted in great love, and true Go&s;|pel-fellow&s;hip. I then cro&s;&s;ed Delaware at the Falls, in order to &s;ee my friends once more in Bucks county, where there is a large body, and got to my worthy friend John Scarborough's on fourth day, with whom I had travelled &s;everal weeks both in the Jer&s;eys and Maryland. I had great &s;atisfaction in his company, he be|ing a man of a good under&s;tanding, a

tender &s;pirit, and very &s;erviceable in the church. The quarterly meeting for mi|ni&s;ters and elders began at Buckingham on fourth day, the thirtieth of the fifth month, which I attended, and al&s;o on fifth day a meeting for wor&s;hip and di&s;|cipline, and I thought different &s;entiments were getting in among&s;t them. It great care is not taken to keep to Truth's teachings, and the une<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ring guidance of it, which will &s;ubdue and keep down all unruly &s;pirits, there will be great trouble and unea&s;ine&s;s, if not &s;eparation, in many places: for I &s;aw an evil &s;pirit of di&s;&s;en|tion was got into the church, and in the ways of its workings, it appeared in di|vers &s;hapes, in order to draw after it the hearts of the &s;imple, and &s;uch as, like it&s;elf, are un&s;table; for it is an un&s;table &s;pirit, and by this it may be known, and &s;uch as are led into its ways, and own its workings. For they will be re&s;tle&s;s, not ea&s;y, under the cro&s;s; but will ca&s;t off the yoke of Chri&s;t, and go from his teachings, meekne&s;s, and humility, into a haughty proud &s;pirit&punc; which is rough, full of hatred and envy, de&s;pi&s;eth coun&s;el, and will not bear reproof. This &s;pirit, I thought, I perceived working in the my|&s;tery of iniquity; but its time is not yet fully come to bring forth its mon&s;trous

birth. The Lord's mercy is very great to his people, for this &s;eed of the &s;erpent hath hitherto been cru&s;hed, and put by, in its puttings forth; and the true &s;eed, though through hard labour and travail, hath been brought forth into dominion, to the prai&s;e of I&s;rael's God.</P>
<P>This quarterly meeting con&s;i&s;ted of &s;everal hundreds, mo&s;tly a young genera|tion. The gracious extendings of divine goodne&s;s was felt, and Truth's power did prevail over all the powers and &s;pirits of darkne&s;s. I was glad I was here, and my &s;pirit did rejoice in the Lord, the God of my &s;alvation. After meeting on &s;ixth day I went home with Samuel Wil&s;on. On fir&s;t day I was at Plum&s;tead meeting, which was attended with good, the power of Truth prevailing. In the evening I was at a meeting nigh Buckingham, at a &s;chool-hou&s;e. It was a large gathering, and we were much comforted and refre&s;h|ed together in the Lord. I was at their monthly meeting at Buckingham on &s;e|cond day, the fourth of the &s;ixth month, in which, through the prevalence and owning of Truth, which came over the minds of the people, things were carried on well, both in the time of divine wor|&s;hip, and in tran&s;acting of the affairs of the church; for the power of Truth kept

<P>After this meeting was over, I went to Wright's-Town monthly meeting, which was next day. In this meeting I had hard labour and exerci&s;e; yet things ended well, I came away &s;atisfied, and thankful in my heart to the Lord, for hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> un&s;peakable mercies. The Falls monthly meeting being on fourth day, I was there al&s;o, had &s;ome &s;ervice for Truth, and parted with &s;everal friends in much love and tenderne&s;s, we not expect|ing to &s;ee each other again in mutability. On fifth day I was at Middletown month|ly meeting, in which I was drawn forth, in the living &s;prin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the Go&s;pel, both in the men's and women's meeting. Then feeling my &s;pirit ea&s;y and clear, I left them in love, and the unity of the

one &s;pirit, which had united us together in a near manner.</P>
<P>On fir&s;t day I was again at North-Wales, and had good &s;atisfaction at their two meetings. On &s;econd day I return|ed again to Philadelphia, having been about a month from the town. On third day, the twelfth of the &s;ixth month, I was at the Bank meeting, in which we were comforted together, it being an edifying &s;ea&s;on to many. I &s;taid in and about Philadelphia about four weeks, vi|&s;iting &s;ome families, and attending meet|ings as they came in cour&s;e, though, in meetings, I had little to &s;ay, being &s;hut up, and much bound in my &s;pirit to keep &s;ilence in that city. The cau&s;e is be&s;t known to the great over&s;eer of his people, who can do with them as &s;eemeth to him good: and I &s;aw it was good for his &s;er|vants to be re&s;igned and contented with all the openings and &s;huttings of his hand; with the various di&s;pen&s;ations he is plea&s;|ed to lead through, that there may not be any confu&s;ion throughout the camp of God's I&s;rael. I could not but rejoice, in thankfulne&s;s of heart, that I was quite &s;ilent, and &s;till in my &s;pirit; being made &s;en&s;ible it was the Lord's own doings, and indeed it is marvellous in our eyes, that he who is the captain of our &s;alva|tion,

&s;hould call for &s;uch a ce&s;&s;ation of arms, for a &s;ea&s;on, that his &s;oldiers might take a little re&s;t under his royal pavilion and canopy of pure love.</P>
<P>I was at Darby week-day meeting the fourth of the week; on fifth day at Che&s;ter week-day meeting; and on &s;ixth day at Chiche&s;ter, where a meeting was appointed for me; which was large, and accompanied with the free extendings of divine mercy to our &s;oul's refre&s;hment. On &s;eventh day I was at London-Grove monthly meeting and al&s;o at their meet|ing on fir&s;t day. It was a contriting and bowing time with many, and we parted in the true unity, fellow&s;hip, and heart-tendering love of the Go&s;pel of Peace. On &s;econd day I was at Concord monthly meeting, which was a hard, laborious, exerci&s;ing &s;ea&s;on, both in time of wor|&s;hip and di&s;cipline; things being much out of Go&s;pel order, by rea&s;on of &s;trife and di&s;cord, as oppo&s;ite to the pure and peaceable government of the church of Chri&s;t, as darkne&s;s is to light. The evil &s;pirit was kept down in a good degree, and that which was out of order much helped by the power of Truth.</P>
<P>The tenth of the &s;eventh month 1759, I got to Philadelphia; the eighteenth, &s;everal friends accompanying me, we
<PB N="127" REF="018146_0127_0FA56090268534C0">
went to Che&s;ter, and the nineteenth on board a ve&s;&s;el, which was bound for Bar|badoes. Sometime after we were got to &s;ea, I was clo&s;ely exerci&s;ed in my mind, which brought me very low, in humble &s;upplication before the Lord, that he would be plea&s;ed to enable me to go through what&s;oever he, in the cour&s;e of his infinite wi&s;dom, might &s;uffer to come upon me, whether for a trial of my faith, or any other of his wi&s;e and good ends. For I could appeal to him in great &s;inceri|ty, it was in obedience to his requirings, that I had undertaken that voyage; and not in my own will. This was indeed with me as a time of renewing of my covenant, and coming under a clo&s;e en|gagement, that if he would but be with me, to deliver and pre&s;erve me in the way that I had to go, &s;o that I might return again to his hou&s;e in true peace; then he &s;hould be my God, and I would &s;erve him. May I therefore, with all the Lord's &s;er|vants every where, not only make cove|nants, when under clo&s;e and deep exer|ci&s;e of &s;oul; but, Oh! let us be concern|ed &s;trictly to ob&s;erve and keep them; for I am a living witne&s;s for him, that he is a covenant-keeping God with his people.</P>

nearly united in the clo&s;e&s;t ties of nature, were brought nigh to me in &s;pirit (though far &s;eparated in body) with &s;trong de&s;ires and fervent &s;upplications, that they might be pre&s;erved in the Truth, and that the Lord, in his infinite mercy, would be plea&s;ed to vi&s;it their &s;ouls with a fre&s;h vi|&s;itation of his pure love. The churches al&s;o of the Lord (e&s;pecially tho&s;e people I had &s;o lately vi&s;ited, and had at times been &s;o clo&s;ely engaged for, in the love of the Father) were &s;pread before me in the neare&s;t manner, with fervent prayer, that they might abide in his love, &s;tand in his coun&s;el, and live in his holy fear; that &s;o we might &s;till be a people to his prai&s;e, and bring honour to his great and holy Name, and the profe&s;&s;ion we are making of the ble&s;&s;ed Truth; that the ble&s;&s;ings which he hath re&s;erved, and laid up in &s;tore, might not be withheld, but plentifully &s;howered down upon his heritage.</P>
<P>My mind now was much ea&s;ed, and that which had been as a load upon my &s;pirit was taken away, and I was freely re&s;igned to the will of God. At that time, if I rightly knew my own heart, the fear of death was al&s;o removed, and, I tru&s;t, the occa&s;ion of it, which is &s;in; for I did not find that my con&s;cience con|demned
<PB N="129" REF="018146_0129_0FA56092935EC168">
me, though I well know, I have nothing to tru&s;t in but divine mercy, through my dear Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in whom, and by whom, all our &s;ins are taken away, and we are redeem|ed unto God, and that by his mo&s;t pre|cious blood. It is by him we al&s;o have acce&s;s to the Father, his &s;pirit bearing witne&s;s with our &s;pirits, that we are his children, often crying, Abba, Father, through the eternal Spirit, which helpeth our infirmities, and maketh interce&s;&s;ion for us; enabling us to a&s;k aright, and pray in an acceptable manner.</P>
<P>I may not omit remarking at this time, when the French were nigh taking us, my &s;pirit was &s;o at liberty, and over them, and all the powers of darkne&s;s in the Lord, that I did not &s;ee it would be &s;o; and having had great freedom and liberty in my mind to go in this &s;ame ve&s;&s;el, could not reflect upon my&s;elf for mi&s;&s;ing of it in any re&s;pect, except it was in making mention of it &s;ometimes too free|ly, which it is likely &s;ome might lay hold of, and that not to their own advantage. When we were taken, the Frenchmen (con&s;idering all their views are for plun|der) did not u&s;e me ill. They took my little money, &s;ome of my linen, and part of my other wearing apparel; but my

bed and che&s;t, with many other nece&s;&s;a|ries, they let me keep; which was of great &s;ervice to me afterwards. For I was now in a part of the world where I was a &s;tranger, and no money of my own left; yet I do not remember I either murmured or repined at what had befal|len me; or that any di&s;tru&s;tful thoughts ro&s;e in my heart, &s;o as to trouble and oppre&s;s my &s;pirit; which I e&s;teemed as one of the mo&s;t &s;ingular favours among&s;t the many I have received from the great and merciful hand.</P>
<P>The privateer belonging to Martinico, we landed at a town called St. Peter's&punc; great part of which was laid in a&s;hes about two weeks after we were &s;et at at liberty, as I was afterwards informed. We were all had to pri&s;on; but our captain, my|&s;elf, the mate, and a pa&s;&s;enger, were put into a little room, which opened into the pri&s;on-yard. I think it was about twelve feet &s;quare, and we upwards of twenty (if I remember right) to lie in it. Before we left the place, my fellow-pri&s;oners be|haved courteou&s;ly and civilly, none of them offering me any abu&s;e, though I had often to reprove, and exhort them to amend their lives. It was extreme hot weather, and our yard, where we had liberty to walk, as well as our lodging
<PB N="131" REF="018146_0131_0FA56093834D0C08">
room, was expo&s;ed to the &s;un mo&s;t of the day. They let me have my bed in the night next to the door and window for the benefit of the air, which was an advantage; but, alas! I had a great di&s;|advantage along with it, for the tub in which we ea&s;ed our&s;elves, &s;tood very nigh me, and the wa&s;h and filth of the court-yard came through a hole in the wall, very nigh the window where I lay, &s;o that oft in the night I was nigh fainting with &s;tink, which the heat of the wea|ther made very nau&s;eous. The bread allowed us was pretty good, but almo&s;t every kind of victuals was loath&s;ome to my &s;tomach in this &s;tinking unwhole&s;ome place. There were &s;alt beef and pork for tho&s;e that could eat them; but it be|ing neither &s;oaked, nor half boiled, I perceived there was but little of it eaten by any. My chief living, whil&s;t there, was bread and water, &s;ometimes a little cof|fee, but that was &s;eldom, for we could not always get it boiled. Oatmeal mixed in water was what I often drank, it &s;erving al&s;o for food. The water they let the pri&s;oners have, I believe, is very unwhol|&s;ome, it being taken up below, where the negroes wa&s;h their clothes, and al&s;o where the filth of the town is ca&s;t in. Mo&s;t of the pri&s;oners, I perceived, were
<PB N="132" REF="018146_0132_0FA5609463276B90">
troubled with a lax; and I had not been there above two or three days, before I was taken with it; which, with the ex|treme heat, and unwhol&s;omene&s;s of the place, brought me &s;o low and weak, that it was hard work for me to walk about a little in the pri&s;on-yard; but I &s;trove, and was helped indeed beyond my own ex|pectation; for after we were &s;et at liberty from the pri&s;on, we were &s;ix days on board the ve&s;&s;el that &s;et us upon the En|gli&s;h i&s;land, in which time I think I &s;uf|fered more hard&s;hip than whil&s;t I was in pri&s;on; for being very weak, and the weather &s;till hot, clo&s;e, and &s;ultry, I could not abide in the cabin among the people, but was forced to lie upon the deck, where I could get air, though I was expo&s;ed to the night-dews, and gu&s;ts of rain, which we &s;ometimes had; all which tended to increa&s;e my di&s;order. The French captain gave me the liberty of the cabin, and &s;hewed me kindne&s;s in other re&s;pects. We were becalmed un|der the i&s;land of Guadaloupe, and came to an anchor in a cove, where we took in fre&s;h water; but I went not on &s;hore. I was informed there was a great mortality among the Engli&s;h &s;oldiers; and many others, who went about bu&s;ine&s;s, were taken off very &s;uddenly at this place.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="018146_0133_0FA56094F858F8F8">The &s;eventh of the ninth month they landed us at the i&s;land called St. Chri&s;to|pher's, where I found &s;ome kind friendly people; though the generality were very gay, light, and airy. After I had been there a little time, my di&s;order abating, I began to gather &s;trength, &s;o as to walk about; and I found a few here, who had &s;ome knowledge of friends, and their principles, by rea&s;on of their education. One Jo&s;hua Law&s;on, a &s;ail-maker by trade, a man of good report among his neighbours, was willing I &s;hould have meetings at his hou&s;e, he having a large room very &s;uitable for that purpo&s;e. So I had &s;everal meetings, the town's people coming pretty generally, and &s;everal were reached, I believe, by the heart-&s;earching power of Truth, which opened unto them their &s;tates and conditions, e&s;pecial|ly &s;ome of the younger &s;ort, who were tender, and very de&s;irous to have meet|ings. But, alas! their eye and expecta|tion began to be &s;o upon the poor weak in&s;trument that I queried in my own mind, whether I &s;hould have any more meetings with them; for that &s;pirit, which hungers after words, &s;ometimes &s;huts up the &s;pring of the true mini&s;try; or it is withheld for a time on that account.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="018146_0134_0FA56095B07CDF50">However, now about, it revived in my mind, that I had felt a draught of the Father's love towards the i&s;land of Nevis, when we &s;ailed pa&s;t it, in our pa&s;&s;age from Martinico; though I was told by one that knew the place (&s;uch was the conduct of many of the inhabitants) there were little hopes of getting a meeting, or being received there; but that did not di&s;courage me, I finding &s;omething in my mind that removed that ob&s;tacle out of the way. Therefore I, with Caleb Copeland, a young man from North America, took boat, and in a few hours arrived at Charles-town, the chief place on the i&s;land. We took up our quarters at a tavern. The day following, being their general court, many of their inha|bitants came to town, and the place where we were being nigh the court-hou&s;e, and the grand jury doing their bu&s;ine&s;s, and dining there, drew a pretty deal of company. Mo&s;t of them, at their fir&s;t &s;eeing me, &s;eemed as though they could hardly be &s;atisfied with gazing; but I endeavoured to keep my eye to the Lord, who&s;e pre&s;ence I felt to be nigh me in a good degree, to keep me &s;till and quiet. So they had their full view of me, till their curio&s;ity was pretty well &s;atisfied. They offered no other incivility,
<PB N="135" REF="018146_0135_0FA560966A71E7E0">
than fleering, I&s;hmael like. However, the grand jury, either out of kindne&s;s, or further to &s;atisfy their curio&s;ity, &s;ent us an invitation to dine with them; but it being late before they went to dinner, our landlady ordered ours &s;ooner. I did not find any thing in my mind again&s;t eating with them; though many of them be a light, vain, airy people, and their company not de&s;irable to a &s;olid mind.</P>
<P>They &s;ent a me&s;&s;enger for us when they &s;at down, by whom I &s;ent word we had dined. But they &s;ent again, &s;o I went in, and told them we took their in|vitation kindly, but we had dined, and therefore de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed from &s;it|ting down with them. They did not &s;eem &s;o light and airy now, as they did before; but &s;aid, they &s;hould have been glad to have had our company. I ob&s;erved, they are very much in the cu&s;tom of drinking of healths, as well as in u&s;ing many other vain compliments, which I had to &s;hew my di&s;like to, not only by not u&s;ing them, but in letting them al&s;o know they were again&s;t our principles, and the apo&s;tle's advice to the believers, where he &s;aith, <Q>Be not conformable to this world; but be ye transformed, by the renewing of your minds.</Q> I much de&s;ire my children may take notice of the&s;e little
<PB N="136" REF="018146_0136_0FA560973B1C4748">
remarks, and put in practice that excel|lent advice of the apo&s;tle, not to be con|formable to the world's language, vain cu&s;toms, and fa&s;hions, which deface that beautiful image and likene&s;s man was fir&s;t created in: for every thing was good that God made, and had an excellency and beauty in it; man, the greate&s;t of all, as long as he keepeth his commandments; but he lo&s;es that likene&s;s and image of innocency, by hearkening to the voice of the &s;erpent, who is called the prince of the power of the air, that now bears rule in the hearts of the children of di&s;|obedience. I would therefore, my dear children, that you may come to know a being transformed by the renewings of the grace and good &s;pirit of Truth, upon your minds and under&s;tandings, into the nature, image, and innocency of the children of God, and &s;tand in it, by keeping his commandments; for herein is man's perfection.</P>
<P>A meeting had been propo&s;ed to be held in the court-hou&s;e, &s;everal &s;eeming to forward it, e&s;pecially an old prie&s;t, who be&s;tirred him&s;elf pretty much; which I thought &s;omewhat &s;trange. When it was nigh time for the meeting, he went along with me to the court-hou&s;e, where the ju&s;tices and &s;everal others had dined,
<PB N="137" REF="018146_0137_0FA56097E8B5A950">
and had not yet broke up; but that was more than I knew before I went in. However, the prie&s;t told them there was a gentleman, as he was plea&s;ed to call me, wanted to give them a &s;ermon, and reque&s;ted that they would give liberty of the hall for a meeting to be held; but one whom they called their chief judge &s;tarted up in a heat, and &s;aid they had not done: and be&s;ides, they wanted no &s;ermons; as for his part, he never loved to hear one in his life. A vulgar and un&s;avoury expre&s;&s;ion to come out of the month of one in his &s;tation; and it made me, that I could hardly tell what to &s;ay about having a meeting that night, only as &s;everal of the people from divers parts of the i&s;land were there, it &s;eemed a very &s;uitable opportunity. However, the old prie&s;t was not at all di&s;couraged with the repul&s;e he had met with; he being re&s;olved I &s;hould have a meeting, went over to the tavern where we lodged, and got the liberty of a chamber, and then came and told me there was a con|venient room, and &s;everal already wait|ing. I went, and found every thing in good order for a meeting, except the people's minds: I was al&s;o in great po|verty, but I think quiet and much re&s;ign|ed. I &s;at in &s;ilence a con&s;iderable &s;pace,
<PB N="138" REF="018146_0138_0FA5609C3A1552E0">
in which time they were very re&s;tle&s;s, and rude in their behaviour, &s;uch as I had &s;eldom &s;een or heard before: at length I had &s;omething ro&s;e in my mind to &s;ay, which reached, I believe, the witne&s;s of Truth in them; for they be|came very quiet and &s;till, and &s;at like another &s;ort of people; and many after meeting confe&s;&s;ed to the Truth of what had been &s;poken.</P>
<P>I had another meeting at that place, and many came. It was a &s;olemn bap|tizing time. The Lord's power had the dominion over all the rough and unruly &s;pirits: prai&s;es be to his all powerful name for ever! There &s;tood <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a man at the clo&s;e of this meeting, and &s;aid, he hoped what had been delivered would have a good effect; for it was very &s;uita|ble advice. More he &s;aid, which is not needful to pen; and I thought it was in a good degree of &s;incerity. Then turn|ing to me, he gave me a friendly invita|tion to his hou&s;e. I told him I took it Kindly, and &s;hould come it opportunity would &s;erve. The company being pretty much gone, he entered into a little di&s;|cour&s;e with me, and told me, he him&s;elf was al&s;o a fellow labourer in the Lord; but he had as little the look of a prie&s;t, as any I had ever &s;een, us I thought.
<PB N="139" REF="018146_0139_0FA5609D2BDAAF40">
He told me al&s;o, he perceived that we had the advantage of them, in that we did not tie our&s;elves up to one text of &s;crip|ture, as they did, and &s;o could &s;peak to the &s;everal &s;tates of the people; for he &s;aid, it could not be &s;uppo&s;ed that one remedy could be &s;uitable to every di&s;ea&s;e. I made &s;ome remarks on his ju&s;t ob&s;erva|tion, with &s;omething concerning the true mini&s;try, the operation of the &s;pirit, and that it was not to be limited; again&s;t which he made no objection, but freely a&s;&s;ented to the Truth. We parted in a kind and friendly manner. I found he was a man of good under&s;tanding, bore a very good character among the people, and was well beloved.</P>
<P>This evening, after he was gone, there came a me&s;&s;enger from one Burnet, a man of note in the i&s;land, to de&s;ire me to pay him a vi&s;it before I left the place; which I did the next morning. He re|ceived us very re&s;pectfully, without mak|ing much ceremony. He a&s;ked me &s;ome que&s;tions concerning my travels and u&s;age among&s;t the French, which I gave him &s;ome account of. He did not &s;eem to want to enter into any di&s;cour&s;e about religious matters, but de&s;ired I would &s;tay longer with them upon the i&s;land; for he &s;aid there were &s;everal who were
<PB N="140" REF="018146_0140_0FA5609E0014DBD8">
the de&s;cendants of Quakers, and un|doubtedly would be glad to &s;ee me. But that did not at all induce me to &s;tay, I finding my&s;elf pretty ea&s;y to leave them; hoping the Lord in his own time will &s;end his &s;ervants and faithful labourers into not only this i&s;land, but many others in this part of the world, where the Go&s;pel rain hath not been &s;o plentifully be&s;towed. Oh, Old England, and North America! Though the&s;e people are too much in the churli&s;h dog's nature, yet many of them would be glad to partake of the crumbs that fall from your tables. Your dainty full &s;tomachs have often loathed the honey-comb, and their poor &s;ouls are wandering about upon the bar|ren mountains of a lifele&s;s profe&s;&s;ion, &s;eeking the living among&s;t the dead. May we therefore, that have received the knowledge of the Truth, and been &s;o often watered, be faithful, and bring forth fruits, an&s;werable to the ble&s;&s;ings received! Then will the Lord, I am fully per&s;uaded, &s;end forth from among&s;t us &s;uch as &s;hall I ring them to Chri&s;t the good Shepherd and ford of true re&s;t and peace.</P>
<P>But to return. After I had &s;taid as long as time would permit, and was tak|ing my leave of the man, he put a parcel
<PB N="141" REF="018146_0141_0FA5609F0F679698">
of money into my hand, which I return|ed, and told him that we did not receive any money for preaching. He &s;aid, we could not travel without expences, and I had been taken by the French, and had &s;uffered &s;ome lo&s;s, and as he gave it me freely, I might receive it. I told him, I was not then in nece&s;ity, therefore was not free to take it: but acknowledged it was his good will, and &s;o took my leave of him. After I had been a little time at our inn, we under&s;tood he had &s;ent his &s;ervant to the landlady, to charge her to take nothing of us, for he would pay all our expences; but it was already paid; and I &s;aw it to be highly expedient for us, to remove all cau&s;e from them that might take occa&s;ion, that the mini&s;try might not be ju&s;tly blamed. I left them in a lov|ing good di&s;po&s;ition of mind towards friends, and am fully per&s;uaded there are hungerings begotten in the hearts of &s;ome of them after the true bread.</P>
<P>Afrer I returned to the i&s;land called St Chri&s;topher's, where I had taken lodgings, not knowing how long I might &s;tay, I was not ea&s;y to omit having meet|ings, e&s;peciaily on fir&s;t days. Several people coming out of the country&punc; I had freedom to &s;it with them, mo&s;t of them behaving in a becoming and &s;olid manner.
<PB N="142" REF="018146_0142_0FA560A06B3727F8">
Truth &s;sometimes favoured us in time of &s;ilence; and though I had thought I &s;hould have been &s;hut up, I found the &s;pring of the Go&s;pel was &s;till opened towards the people, at times, in the free extendings of God's love. And it came into my mind, in the opening of Truth, that the Lord hath a &s;eed &s;own in tho&s;e i&s;lands, which lies under the clods of the earth; but its ri&s;ing and coming into do|minion mu&s;t be left to his time; he being able to dethrone antichri&s;t, bring down his kingdom, with all his &s;trong holds, and in the room thereof, to e&s;tabli&s;h his own everla&s;ting righteou&s;ne&s;s; that &s;o in the very place where it was &s;aid, they are no people, there &s;hall they be called the children of the living God.</P>
<P>I found &s;ome of them de&s;irous that I would vi&s;it them in their families, which I complied with, as I found freedom; often having to &s;et before them their un|chri&s;tian practice, in keeping their fel|low creatures in &s;lavery for term of life, and the cruelty they u&s;ed towards them, which exceeded all that I had ever &s;een before; and it rai&s;ed &s;uch a ju&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">digna|tion in my heart, that I u&s;ed gre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t free|dom of &s;peech &s;ometimes in conver&s;ation.

&s;ome good tendency, either to &s;ilence, or bring &s;ome acknowledgment from them, that the practice was unchri&s;tian, and not to be ju&s;tified; that they had no right to plead for keeping them, but that of force, and they were a daily plague, and cau&s;ed them to run into a great deal of &s;in. Thus I have heard &s;ome of them complain, wi&s;hing they had never had them, or had &s;ome other way to get their bread. So we may perceive the Lord is ri&s;ing, by his pure witne&s;s, in judgment in the hearts of tho&s;e negro-keepers, &s;hewing them the practice is evil, and they cannot ju&s;tify it, becau&s;e the light condemns it, and maketh it manife&s;t to them to be evil. I tarried at this place longer than I expected; but hope it was not time &s;pent altogether unprofitably. And although I have been hindered from going to the place, I at fir&s;t &s;et out for, I have had evident tokens of God's love and fatherly care over me, in the various &s;teps I have had to tread; yet notwith&s;tandiug this evidence of di|vine approbation, I have not been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">|&s;ible, that mouths would be opened not only again&s;t me, in &s;aying I was wrong led, or under a deception, but al&s;o again&s;t the Truth; for the Truth hath many ene|mies, and none greater and readier to

<P>However, whil&s;t I tarried here, I often enquired for a pa&s;&s;age to the winward i&s;lands, that &s;uch occa&s;ion might be taken away, and I be clear of the blood of all men. I thought by way of Antigua might be proper; but when I made &s;ome attempts towards it, I was always &s;topped in my mind, not being free to leave the place where I was. But when I had tar|ried &s;ome time longer, and had divers good opportunities among the people, I felt my&s;elf quite ea&s;y to leave the i&s;land; and not only &s;o, but likewi&s;e a &s;trong de&s;ire to be gone; al&s;o that view, and tho&s;e drawings I had before, to vi&s;it the other i&s;lands, were entirely removed, and I was ea&s;y to return in a ve&s;&s;el which was then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> for Philadelphia. Therefore, taking leave of tho&s;e I was pretty nearly acquainted with in Ba&s;&s;eterre, the chief town on the i&s;land, I went by land to Sandy Point, where the ve&s;&s;el lay to take in part of her cargo. Here I had a meet|ing with the town's people the day before we &s;et &s;ail, which was the &s;econd of the

<P>Whil&s;t I tarried in tho&s;e i&s;lands, there was a great mortality among the people, bur it did not bring that awfulne&s;s and humility upon their minds, which it ought to have done; and therefore the divine hand undoubtedly will be &s;tretehed out &s;till. The captain and men behaved very civilly to me in this pa&s;&s;age. I had &s;eve|ral meetings with the &s;hip's company, which had &s;ome good effect, I believe, upon the &s;eamen. We arrived at Phila|delphia the twenty-ninth of the eleventh month, where I was very kindly received by my friends, who had, I believe, near|ly &s;ympathized with me in my late exer|ci&s;es. I &s;taid in the city a little more than two weeks, except a &s;hort vi&s;it to Wilmington friends. A conferrence was held with the Indians whil&s;t I tarried here, which I was at; and Daniel Stan|ton and my&s;elf, with a few other friends, had a meeting with them at Philadelphia in the &s;tate-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>After &s;ome time of waiting in &s;ilence, I had &s;omething to &s;ay, and one I&s;aac Still, an Indian, who could &s;peak En|gli&s;h, delivered the &s;ub&s;tance of what I &s;aid in the Indian language. He appear|ed

tender and well &s;atisfied, being a &s;en&s;ible &s;ober young man. Tedeu&s;cung, and &s;everal of the Delaware chiefs were pre&s;ent, and a few of the Jer&s;ey Indians. They were &s;olid, attentive, and behaved in a becoming manner. The meeting ended in humble prayer and &s;upplication to Almighty God. My &s;tay being but &s;hort here, after I returned from the We&s;t-Indies, I endeavoured to take my leave of friends in as general a manner as time would permit, and the &s;ixteenth of the twelfth month 1759, being the fir&s;t of the week, after a good and &s;atis|factory &s;ea&s;on with friends at Pine-&s;treet meeting-hou&s;e, I took my farewell of them in the uniting love and pure fellow|&s;hip of the Go&s;pel of peace.</P>
<P>I went on board the &s;hip Carolina, at the wharf; the ma&s;ter's name was James Friend, a kind, courteous man. We had a very difficult pa&s;&s;age, by rea|&s;on of high winds, and a leaky ve&s;&s;el; yet, through the mercy and goodne&s;s of kind Providence, we arrived &s;afe at Lon|don the twenty-ninth of the fir&s;t month 1760, where I &s;taid but a few days be|fore I took leave of friends there, and returned home to my dear wife and chil|dren, who, in my ab&s;ence, with all that

<P>IT having plea&s;ed divine providence, to remove from us by death our worthy friend James Gough, we feel our minds impre&s;&s;ed to give forth the following te&s;|timony concerning him.</P>
<P>By authentic accounts we find he was born at Kendal in We&s;tmoreland in the year 1712. And, in his young years, was made &s;en&s;ible of an inward monitor to reprove his propen&s;ity to evil, and convince him of the error of his ways, which made, at times, profitable impre&s;|&s;ions on his mind for a &s;ea&s;on; b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, through the in&s;tability of youth, the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions proved not deep enough to be la&s;ting, till about the twenty-fir&s;t year of his age, when he removed from the North of England to Bri&s;tol, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> plea&s;ed divine goodne&s;s to favour him with a fre&s;h and prevailing vi&s;itation of his love, whereby he was made willing to give up, in &s;elf-denial and circum&s;pection of life, to yield obedience to his requiring<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, who in his fatherly loving-kindne&s;s had thus vi&s;ited his &s;oul: and, by the gradual ope|ration
<PB N="xv" REF="018146_0177_0FA560C3B1C086C8">
of the divine power therein, he experienced a growth in the work of &s;anctification, and was thereby formed into a ve&s;&s;el prepared for the Ma&s;ter's u&s;e.</P>
<P>About the year 1738, he removed from Bri&s;tol, and &s;ettled in Cork, and &s;oon af|ter he came forth in a public te&s;timony, to the virtue and efficacy of that truth, which him&s;elf had experienced the be|neficial effects of, and growing in his gift, he became an able mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel, and an in&s;trument of &s;ervice in the church.</P>
<P>His fir&s;t journey, in the work of the mini&s;try, was in the year 1740, to the counties of Cumberland, We&s;tmoreland, Lanca&s;hire, and part of York&s;hire: His next to Lein&s;ter province: and in the &s;ummer 1743, he vi&s;ited the meetings of friends through the principality of Wales, and many parts of England; in the cour&s;e of which vi&s;it, he attended the yearly meeting of Wales, with tho&s;e of Bri&s;tol and London. Soon after his return he thought it his duty to remove into Lein&s;ter province, and fixed his re&s;idence in Mountmelick, where his &s;ervice became exten&s;ive, being in the center of a large body of friends. He almo&s;t con&s;tantly attended our province, quarterly and
<PB N="xvi" REF="018146_0178_0FA560C4406EA820">
national meetings, where he was often drawn forth in the pure &s;treams of go&s;|pel love, to the refre&s;hment, and edifica|tion of friends: In the year 1774, he &s;ettled in this city, where he was well re|ceived, and well beloved, his innocent life and conver&s;ation adorning his go&s;pel la|bours among&s;t us, being filled with love to mankind in general, and in particu|lar to the flock and family, with whom he was joined in religious fellow&s;hip.</P>
<P>He followed his occupation of &s;chool-ma&s;ter, for &s;ome time in this city, but, in his advanced years, not being &s;uffici|ently able to bear the fatigue and con|finement attendant on that employment, and being de&s;irous to be more at liberty for the exerci&s;e of his gift, he gave it up: and for the three la&s;t years of his being a member of this meeting, travelled much abroad in the different quarters of this nation, vi&s;iting the meetings, and, in many places, the families of friends, to &s;tir up the pure mind by way of remem|brance, and to provoke to love and good works.</P>
<P>And finally, being on a religious vi&s;it to friends in the province of Mun&s;ter, and having proceeded to the city of Cork,

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>FOR my own future benefit, and for theirs too into who&s;e hands it may fall, I am induced to commit to writing the following review of my days, now in the 66th year of my age: for &s;ince we are launched on the ocean of life, our principal care ought to be to &s;teer our cour&s;e through it to the port of re&s;t, and unmixed felicity, though it were through all kinds of hard&s;hip and &s;elf-denial; &s;ince, if we fail of this at la&s;t, it is then too late to amend it.</P>
<P>Could all the plea&s;ures and advantages of this life be attained and enjoyed per|fect and unmixed to it's period, even &s;o they would be no compen&s;ation for the lo&s;s of happine&s;s in a future and immortal &s;tate. But tho&s;e plea&s;ures and advan|tages never can he &s;o enjoyed by any one, unle&s;s his pa&s;&s;ions and inclinations are &s;ubject to the government of God, who alone ought to govern his creatures, and who di&s;covers his will, to the humble at|tentive mind.</P>
<P>Indeed the temporary enjoyers of the good things of this life, may &s;hew a face of plea&s;ure to ignorant &s;pectators, while they &s;eem to float, without interruption, in the mid&s;t of gratifications and amu&s;e|ments: yet a &s;ecret worm is often felt by
<PB N="xx" REF="018146_0182_0FA560C745C68018">
them, as it were gnawing at the latent root of their exaltation and grandeur.</P>
<P>It is the univer&s;al and impartial regard of Omnipotence, which rebukes them for letting loo&s;e the reigns of their lu&s;ts or eager inclinations, de&s;igning thereby their timely reformation for their everla&s;ting good.</P>
<P>It often oppo&s;es the ambitious and proud, in their career, with the unwel|come di&s;coveries, that they are roving in other pur&s;uits than tho&s;e that heaven de|&s;igned for them: and not applying their precious time and talents to the great and good purpo&s;e for which they were given. Sometimes it di&s;plays the beauties and be|nefits of rectitude, de&s;erted by them; and &s;ometimes the horror and &s;ad con&s;equence of per&s;i&s;ting in the neglect or viola|tion of duty, thus di&s;covered on the one hand, and counteracted by them on the other.</P>
<P>Hence too generally, di&s;liking the check to pre&s;ent ea&s;e and plea&s;ure, &s;uch as are intru&s;ted with the means of doing good, and helping others on their way, turn their attention from this omnipre&s;ent monitor, this faithful bo&s;om friend. They fly to tempting varieties, to &s;oothing de|ceptions, to amu&s;ing recreations; they bear their heads aloft among the envying multitudes, and &s;eek to drown his &s;alu|tary
<PB N="xxi" REF="018146_0183_0FA560CA16E15878">
admonitions in &s;plendor, noi&s;e, flut|ter, intemperance and di&s;&s;ipation.</P>
<P>Many &s;uch I have known, who are now gone to their long homes, whom in my younger years I envied.</P>
<P>I have been &s;o fooli&s;h as to transfer my envy from them, after they di&s;ap|peared, to their vain and &s;hort-lived &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors; many of whom are al&s;o gone, and &s;o will the re&s;t ere long. And then what follows tho&s;e that have left their heaven behind them, who a&s;&s;uming to them&s;elves the direction that was due to God, have refu&s;ed the reverence and obe|dience of his laws? Ah then the enviers and envied, like the blind led by the blind, fall into one aby&s;s. Unfit for the regions of pure love to God and each other, of perfect peace, of <HI>joy un&s;peakable and full of glory</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Peter</NOTE>, they are debarred from admi&s;&s;ion into them. Separated in the cour&s;e of ju&s;tice, plunged with the va&s;t and innumerable ho&s;ts of rebellious and execrable &s;pirits, all their bitterne&s;s, envy, re&s;entment, eager de&s;ires ungrati|fied, uncea&s;ing vexation and angui&s;h de|&s;cend with them, with infinite increa&s;e in an unbodied &s;tate.</P>
<P>A &s;en&s;ual earthly mind is too much vitiated to reli&s;h the pure joys, or to &s;uit
<PB N="xxii" REF="018146_0184_0FA560CB74B95C38">
the &s;ociety of the &s;pirits of the ju&s;t made perfect. Goodne&s;s is painful to the wick|ed, being &s;o contrary to the depravity of their nature. Heaven would be no hea|ven to them.</P>
<P>A change of heart is nece&s;&s;ary to be experienced by every man, from a &s;tate of nature to a &s;tate of grace; from earthly and &s;en&s;ual di&s;po&s;itions and af|fections, to holy and heavenly, in or|der to be fitted for the fruition of, as well as the admi&s;&s;ion into the kingdom of heaven. It is then the greate&s;t wi&s;|dom, while time and opportunity are af|forded, to u&s;e all diligence to attain that &s;tate of mind, whereby we may be pre|pared when all the tran&s;itory delights, amu&s;ements and de&s;irable objects of this world fail, to be received into everla&s;ting habitations: and how ought our hearts to be filled with thankfulne&s;s to God, who in his univer&s;al love to mankind, hath provided for them a phy&s;ician, able and willing to heal all nations, to create clean hearts, and renew right &s;pirits in all, who &s;ubmit to him, and follow his directions.</P>
<P>But in order to attain this de&s;irable &s;tate, we mu&s;t make a total &s;urrender of our&s;elves to the divine will revealed to us, in daily &s;elf denial and fidelity; per|&s;evering therein to the end of our days, ardent in de&s;ire to do good, and to be

conformed to the mind of our creator.</P>
<P>The le&s;s we look out unnece&s;&s;arily into the world, or covet its honours, favours, friend&s;hip and greatne&s;s, and the more we look to God with a &s;ingle eye, and covet his honour, favour, friend&s;hip and riches, the more &s;hall we expe|rience a growth in the very root, and in all the branches of the divine life, that we may be as a cha&s;te &s;pou&s;e to Chri&s;t in every de&s;ire and aim, in every motion of the mind, and its companion the body too, and &s;urely he ever merits it from us, even he who has graciou&s;ly vi&s;ited, and from day to day invited, and called us out of the &s;pirit and ways of the world, to join him&s;elf, in order to partake with him and his, of pure peace and joy in the pre&s;ent, and more infinitely in a future &s;tate. His call is <Q>Come out from among them, and be ye &s;eparate, touch no unclean thing, and I will receive you, and I will be a father to you,</Q> &amp;c.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. vi. 17, 18.</NOTE></P>
<P>By this call were our honourable pre|dece&s;&s;ors in the beginning, &s;eparated from the &s;pirit and ways of the world, and incited to refu&s;e touching the unclean thing or whatever &s;prang from an impure &s;ource, what per&s;ecution &s;oever that re|fu&s;al might co&s;t them, knowing that he

whom they obeyed and in whom they tru&s;ted, would carry them thro' all op|po&s;ition, which they experienced (to their un&s;peakable joy) to be fulfilled, and live|lily te&s;tified to the world, many of them, both living and dying.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e happy men and women left the Lord's vineyard (thro' their faithful la|bours with the divine ble&s;&s;ing upon them) well fenced and clean (having gathered out the &s;tones thereof) and abounding with the excellent fruits of the holy &s;pirit of Chri&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>MEMOIRS OF THE LIFE, OF <HI>JAMES GOUGH.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I WAS born at Kendal in We&s;tmore|land on the 27th of 12th month, 1712, and my parents John and Mary Gough, profe&s;&s;ing the Truth as held by the people called Quakers, I received my education in the &s;ame profe&s;&s;ion. My mother, who was an indu&s;trious, careful, well-minded woman, taught me to read; and when I was a little turned of five years of age I commenced a &s;cholar in friends' &s;chool in my native town, under the tuition of Thomas Rebanks, at which &s;chool I con|tinued till my fifteenth year. Having a
<PB N="2" REF="018146_0188_0FA560CEA9C50DE0">
good genius and a propen&s;ity to learning I attained with facility and readine&s;s the Latin and Greek languages; and my quick proficiency therein, (I being of little &s;tature for my age) excited admira|tion, procured me the fame of a great &s;cholar, va&s;tly magnified my little &s;tock of attainments; and al&s;o introduced me to the notice of &s;everal per&s;ons of eminence in the town, who would frequently que&s;|tion me in re&s;pect to my learning, and were generally plea&s;ed with my ready an&s;wers.</P>
<P>In particular a di&s;tingui&s;hed ju&s;tice of peace, with his wife, took a &s;ingular notice of me, admitting me (young as I was) to free conver&s;ation with them, and intro|ducing me at times into grand company which frequented their hou&s;e. The &s;aid ju&s;tice would &s;ay, that if my parents would give me up to him, he would &s;end me to the univer&s;ity to receive a proper education. This flattered my ambition, as it was what at that time I heartily wi&s;hed for.</P>
<P>By the&s;e means the &s;eeds of wild na|ture, the noxious weeds of pride and vain conceit (the produce of every &s;oil) re|ceived &s;trength and nouri&s;hment in my early minority, and &s;hot up high for my pre&s;ent childi&s;h age.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="018146_0189_0FA560CFB1F064B0">But in &s;ome &s;ort to counterbalance the&s;e incentives to pride and airy notions, I had the advantage of receiving my edu|cation in a place, in and about which there lived many worthy friends, who&s;e exemplary lives, and religious care and labours, often in my early years made good impre&s;&s;ions on my mind, which (though my own propen&s;ities &s;oon effaced them) left fixed upon my brea&s;t an ho|nourable e&s;teem for tho&s;e truly good men and women, with painful reflections under the &s;en&s;e of my own infidelity, and &s;ecret wi&s;hes for that happy condition, which, I really believed them to be e&s;tabli&s;hed in, by Chri&s;t their Redeemer and Sovereign.</P>
<P>My under&s;tanding was enlightened when very young, to &s;ee both my own defici|encies in duty, and tho&s;e of many others more advanced in years; and I thought, if I lived to be a man, their harms &s;hould be my warnings.</P>
<P>I remember a worthy mini&s;ter, Jo&s;eph Jordan from Virginia, having had the &s;mall-pox at a friend's hou&s;e in Kendal, and being rai&s;ed up again; at the fir&s;t meeting which he got to after it, was drawn out in &s;uch a moving manner in his mini&s;try, that the meeting in general &s;eemed to be impre&s;&s;ed with great tender|ne&s;s under it: and I then (though but
<PB N="4" REF="018146_0190_0FA560D02DCF8618">
very young) had a &s;hare therein. The de&s;irablene&s;s of living &s;o, as to obtain di|vine favour &s;eemed to be very clearly and &s;trongly &s;et before our view. And the op|portunity had &s;ome good effect upon my mind for a &s;hort &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>Here we may remark the advantage that accrues to religious &s;ociety and to meetings, where they are favoured with a number of faithful elders, living mini&s;ters, and &s;piritually-minded friends; men of truth, "fearing God and hating covet|ou&s;ne&s;s."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Exod. xviii. 21.</NOTE> The liveline&s;s of their &s;pirits; the clearne&s;s of their &s;ight, and the uni|formity of their conduct and conver&s;ation, qualify them to &s;hew the people how they &s;hould walk in the pur&s;uit of peace, both by precept and example; precepts drawn from the living &s;pring of experience, and examples formed by a watchful attention to the pointings and limitations of truth. I remember &s;ome who&s;e very countenances &s;eemed to command awe, and impre&s;s ob|&s;ervers with &s;erious con&s;ideration. As the &s;alt of the earth, &s;ea&s;oning tho&s;e among&s;t whom they walked, with a &s;en&s;e of the truth which lived and predominated in them; under the powerful influence there|of the&s;e kept up meetings both for wor|&s;hip
<PB N="5" REF="018146_0191_0FA560D0EFF79250">
and di&s;cipline, and were enabled thereby to keep things in good order, as them&s;elves were a good &s;avour in their allotments. On the other hand we may ob&s;erve that where the elders and active friends are not under this qualification; but under the form, are &s;uffering their hearts to go after their covetou&s;ne&s;s, &s;e|cretly departing from under the influence of this divine principle, the cau&s;e and prevalence of Truth too often decline among&s;t the different ranks of the people, <Q>as in the day when a &s;tandard bearer fainteth.</Q></P>
<P>My mother made it her maxim in h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> plan of education to accu&s;tom her chil|dren to u&s;eful employment, frugal fare, and to have our wills cro&s;&s;ed, in order hereby to render us better fitted to undergo any &s;uture hard&s;hips in life, that might be allotted to befal us. And I have rea|&s;on to think that her cares and endea|vours, with the examples and labours of good friends, were to me as "bread ca&s;t upon the waters,"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eccl. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">1.1</NOTE> which appeared after many days. In the intervals of &s;chool-hours &s;he would be for employing me in one u&s;eful occupation or other. This I thought a great hard&s;hip; and be|ing
<PB N="6" REF="018146_0192_0FA560D1E282BF50">
much mortified thereby, I exerted my wits to evade it, often feigning pretences of &s;chool-ta&s;ks and exerci&s;es, &s;et me by my ma&s;ter, and &s;uch like groundle&s;s ex|cu&s;es.</P>
<P>The great duty of education, to di&s;|charge it rightly, needs divine in&s;truction and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, as much as any duty in life, and therefore parents have need fervently to pray for it, and faithful|ly to follow it when received. Other|wi&s;e they may be in danger of falling &s;hort, and the deviations and mi&s;carriages of the children (at lea&s;t in part) may lie at their doors.</P>
<P>But if my mother might &s;eem to err on the one hand, viz. that of &s;everity, it is to be feared that the far greater number err on the other hand, viz. that of indul|gence and connivance: and that though the former be more painful for the pre&s;ent, yet the latter generally proves more per|nicious in its effects and future con&s;e|quences. I verily believe, I have enjoyed a better &s;tate of health, from being brought up in a hardy way, as my con&s;titution was but weak and tender.</P>
<P>Upon a review of my &s;tate at this age, my recollection repre&s;ents it as a compli|cation of ambition, envy, craft and de|ceit; but that even then, a divine moni|tor
<PB N="7" REF="018146_0193_0FA560D268128798">
was near me, to manife&s;t and reprove the corruption of my heart, and the evil of my ways. I was &s;en&s;ible of my mother's anxious care for my pre&s;ervation from evil, and attainment of good: but I eluded as much as I could, the confine|ment which &s;he thought conducive thereto, in keeping me under her own eye, and out of the way of corrupting com|pany. I loved liberty; I fought it with eagerne&s;s, frequently got it by craft, and abu&s;ed it to my hurt, as unexperi|enced young people are too apt to do.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate, I well remember, I was afraid and a&s;hamed to meet with good friends, &s;uch as I yet loved and honoured, being inwardly convicted from the con&s;ci|ou&s;ne&s;s of my own vile and unguarded conduct. Sometimes I received from &s;ome of them the reproof I de&s;erved; and &s;ome|times I thought their very &s;ilence rebuked me. At other times in their company the love and de&s;ire of goodne&s;s re-entered with a &s;trong force. But being withdrawn therefrom, temptation too often rein&s;tated vice in its wonted &s;eat in my heart, and in the direction of my conduct.</P>
<P>I ea&s;ily and clearly &s;aw the wide differ|ence betwixt good and bad company, and how much the former was preferable; yet the powerful allurements of the latter
<PB N="8" REF="018146_0194_0FA560D3376BCA38">
forcibly drew me into, and held me fa&s;t in a wretched captivity thereto, manife&s;tly contrary to my better judgment, which, I fear is the ca&s;e of many others.</P>
<P>There being a large body of friends in the county of We&s;tmoreland and the adjacent parts, our general meetings were many of them very largely attended; and as it was the care of the elders, and other friends concerned for the welfare of the youth, to encourage them very early to attend the meetings of di&s;cipline for their im|provement in virtue and &s;obriety; I at|tended many of the&s;e large meetings, but too frequently without reaping any &s;hare of the real benefit intended by them, or receiving any other impre&s;&s;ions than tho&s;e of vanity and airy ambition: &s;o that however &s;uch meetings were favoured with divine virtue and power, the di&s;&s;ipation and ab&s;ence of my fooli&s;h roving mind rendered it like the barren heath, not profiting by the fruitful &s;hower, or chear|ing beams of the &s;un.</P>
<P>And there is rea&s;on to fear, that this may be the ca&s;e of too many young peo|ple, who are plea&s;ed to go to the&s;e large meetings from other motives than tho&s;e of piety, who, forgetful of the intent and de&s;ign of them, indulge their corrupt in|clinations in very un&s;ea&s;onable gaiety and
<PB N="9" REF="018146_0195_0FA560D62B7296D0">
What the faithful labourers in the church endeavour to build up, the&s;e in their unguarded conduct pull down, and &s;ometimes bring reproach and di&s;|agreeable reflections on their religious profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Whereas had the&s;e meetings been con|&s;tantly beautified with an uniformity in the conduct of profe&s;&s;ors, con&s;i&s;tent with the divine principle of Truth and the doc|trines of its faithful mini&s;ters, they would have proved of much greater &s;ervice. For as the Truth is in it&s;elf un&s;potted, and its excellency unchangeable, the glory and dignity thereof would have &s;hined forth very amiably and attractively in the eyes of the nations, had not the mi&s;conduct of its profe&s;&s;ors too frequently and exten|&s;ively eclip&s;ed its genuine lu&s;tre; which merits the &s;olid con&s;ideration of all, who have been educated, or have joined in profe&s;&s;ion with us; both when they attend &s;uch meetings, and at all other times.</P>
<P>(1727.) Being arrived at my fifteenth year, my mother was anxious to have me put to &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s. Through her per&s;ua&s;ion my father in the cour&s;e of his travels, &s;poke to David Hall (the memoirs of who&s;e life are extant, and for whom my mother had an honourable e&s;teem) and agreed with him to take me
<PB N="10" REF="018146_0196_0FA55FA673950848">
as u&s;her to his &s;chool, de&s;iring no other terms for me but my board, and &s;uch in|&s;truction as he might &s;ee I yet needed: which gave my mother great &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>She accompanied me to his hou&s;e at Skipton in York&s;hire. And here I expe|rienced the advantage of the education &s;he had given me, for thereby I was pre|pared to &s;ubmit more willingly to conti|nual employ and hard&s;hip. And though many of the boys coming from full hou&s;es and plentiful tables, thought their fare here mean (as indeed the price for both boarding and tuition, was but eight pounds per annum) yet to me it was in general otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>There happened to be in the family at this time two youths, who&s;e ca&s;es or events in life, I think not improper to mention by way of caution: but their names I would wi&s;h to be buried in oblivion, un|le&s;s they may yet be favoured with repent|ance to &s;alvation.</P>
<P>The one was a lodger in the hou&s;e. He was a valuable pattern and very helpful in the family. I e&s;teemed him to be in a happy condition, and &s;till believe he was &s;o at that time. He had a few words in the mini&s;try and grew in his gift; but afterwards becoming exalted, and too fond of applau&s;e, he fell into the &s;nares
<PB N="11" REF="018146_0197_0FA55FA7308D0420">
of the grand enemy, and brought a re|proach on the Truth, and on the mini&s;try. What need hath he that &s;tandeth, or thinketh he &s;tandeth to take heed le&s;t lie fall!</P>
<P>The other was at that time an appren|tice to David Hall. He was afterwards a mini&s;ter well e&s;teemed among many friends; but alas! he al&s;o &s;hamefully fell. And what renders the ca&s;e of the&s;e my formerly well-beloved friends &s;till more melancholy, is, that though there is balm in Gilead, yet they and others, whom the enemy has thus wounded, and poi|&s;oned, will not turn to the phy&s;ician there, but rather endeavour to have their wounds deceitfully healed.</P>
<P>I remember to have heard one, who had ba&s;ely fallen in an unguarded hour, boa&s;t|ing a few years after, that he had been wa&s;hed in the bottom of Jordan, and had brought up &s;tones of memorial; and this in an affected mini&s;terial way, when it appeared not to be the ca&s;e to any but him&s;elf: but rather that the poor man was &s;till under the deception of the crafty enemy, willing to deceive him&s;elf, and wanting to deceive others, while he was at be&s;t but very &s;uperficially wa&s;hed from deep defilements. Judgment had not had its perfect work, though he was very
<PB N="12" REF="018146_0198_0FA55FA7F0515E98">
willing to think and to have it thought by others that it had. And to evade that awful con&s;ideration, that the mo&s;t pure and righteous God is jealous of his honour, and requires our going clean through all that humiliation, labour and patience, which his light in the con&s;cience di&s;covers to be nece&s;&s;ary for repairing the di&s;honour incurred. All palliations or &s;oftening ex|cu&s;es; all arts to conciliate human com|pa&s;&s;ion and favour, are but like fig-leaf coverings, through which the nakedne&s;s of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors is manife&s;t to &s;uch as are endued with true &s;ight, and like dawbing over de&s;tructive breaches with untempered mortar.&mdash;But enough of this digre&s;&s;i|on, wi&s;hing it may prove u&s;eful where needed.</P>
<P>(1728.) When I had &s;tayed in my &s;ervice at Skipton a little more than a year, my ma&s;ter gave me leave to return to Kendal to &s;ee my relations. He made me the bearer al&s;o of a letter to my fa|ther, wherein he &s;ignified, that con&s;idering my years, he approved of my qualificati|ons and conduct, and offered wages for my future &s;ervice. My mother took little notice of the offer; but was exceedingly rejoiced at the other part of the letter as giving her better hopes on my behalf than &s;he hitherto had.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="018146_0199_0FA55FA8AC6C0260">In the cour&s;e of the &s;ucceeding year, by agreement between my father and my ma&s;ter, I &s;pent three months with Richard Kennedy writing ma&s;ter in Liverpool, to improve my&s;elf in writing, and learn &s;ome branches of the mathematics. One &s;eventh day while here, I (having always a great propen&s;ity to &s;ee towns and places that were new to me) went to &s;ee the city of Che&s;ter, and lodged two nights at Peter Leadbetter's; in my return by Fa&s;tham Ferry, which is five miles athwart to Liverpool, an elderly gentlewoman hav|ing got &s;ome play-books in the boat, I of|fered to read for her: as I was reading, &s;ome hor&s;es in the boat grew unruly, which terrified her very much; &s;o that &s;he put by her play-books, and would no more (while we were in the boat) touch them her&s;elf, nor &s;uffer me to touch one of them.</P>
<P>Many remarkable pre&s;ervations I had in my younger days: but the mo&s;t re|markable was during this my re&s;idence at Liverpool which happened as follows. One fir&s;t day in the afternoon I went with &s;ome other boys a boating in the dock, which by means of flood-gates was kept &s;o full of water as to keep the &s;hips afloat, when the tide was out. We rowed &s;eve|ral times from one end of the dock to the
<PB N="14" REF="018146_0200_0FA55FA9A33686C0">
other At length &s;ome rude boys, that were &s;tronger than we took from us our oar, or oars, and this in all probability proved the means of our pre&s;ervation. For now we found our&s;elves obliged to work our way with our hands by the &s;hips to the upper end of the dock. Which ju&s;t as we reached, we heard a noi&s;e as of the loude&s;t thunder: climbing up from the boat unto the quay, we &s;oon found that the dock gates being grown old were broken down. The water ru&s;hing out in a rapid torrent, bore down all before it, over&s;etting and greatly damaging &s;everal ve&s;&s;els that lay near them. The frightful nearne&s;s of &s;uch a danger, and narrow e&s;cape from it &s;o affected my mind, as to invade my &s;leep that night, and repeat it|&s;elf again to my imagination with aggra|vations of horror.</P>
<P>At the expiration of my three months here, I went to Kendal yearly meeting, where my father, being ju&s;t arrived from a journey, in which he had made his way through Skipton, informed me that he had agreed with David Hall to bind me to him for four years longer; this was no agreeable intelligence to me, for although I honoured my worthy ma&s;ter, yet every thing el&s;e was not as I could wi&s;h it. I thought I could fore&s;ee much hard&s;hip to
<PB N="15" REF="018146_0201_0FA55FAA35504CD8">
be unavoidably my lot: yet as my father had &s;o agreed, I thought it my duty to comply. I endeavoured to put a good heart and face upon it, and &s;o entered upon my part. During the&s;e four years my ma&s;ter was frequently abroad at meetings. He did not often mi&s;s the quarterly meetings at York, and &s;ome|times attended the yearly meeting at London, and then the care of the &s;cho|lars in and out of &s;chool lay heavy on me.</P>
<P>Both before my coming to Skipton, and while I was there, I often had fre&s;h de&s;ires kindled in my heart after redemp|tion, I was &s;hewn clearly the nece&s;&s;ity of it, and the danger of delays in a mat|ter of &s;uch con&s;equence; &s;o that I left off playing for a time, thinking it great infatuation to &s;quander my precious hours in play, when in danger of my life, and that too for ever. But the mo&s;t particu|lar reach I had, was at a meeting in our &s;chool-hou&s;e under the baptizing mini&s;try of John Fothergill, whereby I was awaken|ed to vigilance for a &s;ea&s;on, ri&s;ing early, and carefully attending to every &s;tep in my bu&s;ine&s;s, and the duties of my &s;tation. But &s;oon, too &s;oon, the fervour of this &s;acred flame abated, and I gradually fell back, and became ju&s;t what I was before:
<PB N="16" REF="018146_0202_0FA55FAAF2A2E018">
yet I did not forget or wholly lo&s;e the &s;en&s;e of this day of my vi&s;itation; but often privately lamented my revolt, and I con|tinued &s;till to maintain a good character among&s;t friends.</P>
<P>I do not remember much more than what I have already intimated in general of the&s;e four years, &s;ave that one time, when my ma&s;ter was abroad, I thought my&s;elf hardly and unrea&s;onably u&s;ed, and thereupon conceived a de&s;ign to run away by night (it being moon-light:) but that kind Providence who&s;e fatherly care was over me, when I was too little careful for my own well-doing, with-held me. For when the time propo&s;ed for putting my de&s;ign in execution arrived, the pernicious con&s;equences of &s;uch a procedure, were &s;o clearly manife&s;ted to my mind, that I was di&s;couraged from the attempt; and therefore concluded patiently to endure what might be permitted to befal me, till the termination of the time contracted for, might bring me my relea&s;e in a reputable and con&s;cientious way.</P>
<P>Near the expiration of my time I writ to &s;ome of my friends, acquainting them, that I intended to try &s;ome new place, and received a letter from my good friend John Wil&s;on of Kendal, &s;ignifying that Alexander Ar&s;cott of Bri&s;tol wanted an
<PB N="17" REF="018146_0203_0FA55FAC4E274698">
u&s;her, and offered twenty pounds per ann. Which offer I readily embraced.</P>
<P>(1733.) So leaving Skipton, and the yearly meeting at Kendal approaching, I went thither, &s;taid a few days with my mother, and then &s;et forward for Bri&s;tol. In my way at Wolverhampton, &s;tanding at the door of the inn where I alighted, I &s;aw a crowd of people pa&s;&s;ing by, and heard it was a Quaker's funeral; where|upon I went to it, and our friend Jo&s;hua Toft (whom I do not remember to have &s;een before) attended it, and was rai&s;ed up in a large and living te&s;timony, where|by I was afre&s;h reached, and con&s;iderably tendered, and thence proceeded on my way, under revived impre&s;&s;ions of good upon my mind, to Worce&s;ter; there I met with William Bee&s;ly going to Bri&s;tol year|ly meeting, with whom I went in compa|ny to Glouce&s;ter, but my hor&s;e being tired I was forced to leave him behind, and walk the greate&s;t part of the remain|der of the way in my boots. In a few weeks after, that worthy mini&s;ter and elder John Richand&s;on of York&s;hire land|ed, in company with Robert Jordan from Penn&s;ylvania, who bought my hor&s;e for the &s;ame price it co&s;t me.</P>
<P>My good ma&s;ter Alexander Ar&s;cott was like a kind and tender father to me. He
<PB N="18" REF="018146_0204_0FA55FACE1482058">
was the elde&s;t &s;on of the par&s;on of South|molton in Devon&s;hire, and him&s;elf edu|cated at the univer&s;ity of Oxford, with intention to &s;it him for the &s;ame func|tion. But when he was ju&s;t ripe for preferment, and might have had a fair pro&s;pect that way, his father being well beloved and re&s;pected among the great men in that country; he turned his back on all pro&s;pects of this kind, being con|vinced of the ble&s;&s;ed truth. This was a great mortification to his father and mo|ther, who would both &s;it weeping by him in the bitterne&s;s of their hearts, as I have heard him relate. This, he added pierced him deeply, as he &s;incerely de&s;ired to be a dutiful &s;on to tender and indulgent parents. A cloud came over his under|&s;tanding, and the enemy in his own brea&s;t &s;ugge&s;ted that he was acting quite wrong. But as he humbled him&s;elf before the Mo&s;t High, imploring his direction, he received a fre&s;h &s;ight that he mu&s;t for&s;ake father and mother for Chri&s;t, and be faithful to the manife&s;tation of his will, through all events. His parents became afterwards better reconciled to his change, when he was &s;ettled in good bu&s;ine&s;s in Bri&s;tol, where he kept &s;chool for the chil|dren of friends and others, from that time till his decea&s;e, being about thirty-five
<PB N="19" REF="018146_0205_0FA55FB18AFE9340">
years, and proved helpful to the re&s;t of his father's family, in procuring them by his intere&s;t, places for getting a livelihood.</P>
<P>I came up to Bri&s;tol quite plain in my garb (as David Hall would not &s;uffer any other in his family) and it being the time of the yearly meeting, at a friend's hou&s;e I fell in company with &s;ome well-minded friends, one or more of whom ob&s;erved to me, that &s;undry young people had come up the &s;ame way from the north of England to the &s;outhern parts, parti|cularly to London and Bri&s;tol; yet after being there a while they ran into the fa&s;hions of tho&s;e places, till they even out|&s;tripped the native inhabitants.</P>

<P>And indeed my whole delight was in the company of Chri&s;t my dear Lord and ma&s;ter. I was directed by him to do all things well, and bear all things with meekne&s;s.

<P>I was affected with an awful impre&s;&s;ion on my fir&s;t embarking; it put me on con|&s;idering on what foundation I ventured my life upon the water. On that head

I was &s;oon favoured with inward &s;atisfac|tion, and re&s;ignation to divine Provi|dence.</P>
<P>The wind being unfavourable we had a very tedious pa&s;&s;age, being ten days on the water from Pill to the Cove of Cork. It was late at night when we landed at Cove, and next morning went up in a boat to Cork, where I lodged about two weeks at Jonas Devon&s;her's, (a friend of a large e&s;tate) his two &s;ons being under my tuition, and afterwards boarded in a friend's family till I married.</P>
<P>The meetings of friends in Ireland, and particularly in the province of Mun&s;ter, not lying &s;o contiguous as in many parts of England, could not &s;o conveniently be joined &s;everal together, to con&s;titute monthly or men's meetings of di&s;cipline for tran&s;acting the affairs of the church, but in the&s;e parts particularly, each par|ticular meeting was a men's meeting in it&s;elf, and &s;ome of the meetings both hereaway and in other parts, being great|ly reduced in number, it became the con|cern of friends in Ireland to recommend, to the larger meetings neare&s;t to them, the care of vi&s;iting the&s;e little meetings fre|quently, to in&s;pect their &s;tate, and help them by advice and coun&s;el as occa&s;ion might require. Two of the&s;e meetings,
<PB N="30" REF="018146_0216_0FA55FBCAA202E00">
viz. the&s;e of Bandon and Youghal were under the care of Cork men's meeting, which was regular and con&s;tant in ap|pointing vi&s;its to them at the &s;tated times.</P>
<P>I being now become a member of Cork men's meeting, (being recommended by certificate from Bri&s;tol) it fell to my lot in company with other friends to go upon a vi&s;it to the meeting of Youghal: here &s;eeing Mary the daughter of John and Martha Dobbs of &s;aid town, a plain and orderly young woman, I found my affections clo&s;ely engaged towards her, and having propo&s;ed to her parents my de&s;ire to addre&s;s her in order to marriage, and obtained their con&s;ent, after &s;ome time we were married there according to the good order u&s;ed in our &s;ociety.</P>
<P>The &s;aid John Dobbs her father being convinced of the truth, while he was a &s;tudent at the univer&s;ity of Oxford, was for his fidelity to conviction di&s;inherited by his father Richard Dobbs of Ca&s;tle. Dobbs near Carrickfergus <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of an e&s;|tate worth &s;everal hundreds per ann. be|ing his elde&s;t &s;on.</P>
<P>His father left it to a younger &s;on, who was to pay my father-in-law ten pounds per ann. out of it, which during the life|time of that &s;on was but indifferently paid, and by his prodigality the e&s;tate
<PB N="31" REF="018146_0217_0FA55FBD32170750">
was involved. But his &s;on Arthur Dobbs, late governor of North Carolina, &s;ucceed|ing to the inheritance thereof, voluntarily doubled the &s;aid annual &s;um, and paid it punctually. My father-in-law having &s;tu|died phy&s;ic at the college, practi&s;ed it with good &s;ucce&s;s, and great Chri&s;tian charity to the poor, &s;o as to &s;ave little from his income that way.</P>
<P>He had been the favourite of the fami|ly, but upon his joining in &s;ociety with friends, and giving up his whole heart to follow the di&s;coveries of the light of Chri&s;t in his own con&s;cience, he was treat|ed by his father with the utmo&s;t &s;everity as a rebel, and then ca&s;t out as an alien. So that he might well be &s;aid to have for|&s;aken for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, father and brethren, and &s;i&s;ters, and hou&s;es, and lands; and like faithful Abraham to have offered up to the Lord whatever was deare&s;t to him in this world, and to have tru&s;ted in God, which was doubtle&s;s counted to him for righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Being beloved by friends, he was urged by &s;ome to have recour&s;e to the law for the recovery of the family e&s;tate as his birthright, which he had done nothing to forfeit, and a&s;&s;i&s;tance offered him for do|ing it. Whereupon he was prevailed with at length to make a beginning; but
<PB N="32" REF="018146_0218_0FA55FC0DCBF6000">
not having that inward peace with Chri&s;t which he preferred before all the world, in the fir&s;t &s;tep of contention, he put a &s;top to all further proceedings, and rather cho&s;e to confide in God without it.</P>
<P>For a more particular account of him, &s;ee the collection of friends' &s;ufferings in folio, vol. 2, and doctor Ratty's Hi&s;tory of the Ri&s;e and Progre&s;s of Truth in Ire|land.

He died about &s;even or eight months after our marriage.</P>
<P>His wife Martha Dobbs was convinced of truth before their marriage, by the dy|ing expre&s;&s;ions of a handmaid of the Lord, viz. Deborah Sandham.

<P>Upon this duty being clearly pre&s;ented to me in this meeting, di&s;couragements and ob&s;tacles poured into my mind in abundance, &s;uch as that if I &s;hould de|liver
<PB N="38" REF="018146_0224_0FA55FC6D8DE45A0">
the words impre&s;t, I &s;hould then be expo&s;ed to much &s;peculation, and become the immediate &s;ubject of conver&s;ation among &s;uch as love to catch and propa|gate matter of amu&s;ement; that perhaps the like duty might never be required of me again, and in that ca&s;e I &s;hould be likely to be remarked, and talked of for many years, as one who had begun and not gone on. In&s;tances occurred of &s;uch as had preached among&s;t us for a time, and had either dropped it and fallen away, or had on one account or another, in|curred a public and general di&s;like or di&s;grace, and that therefore it might be &s;afer and better for me to re&s;t quiet with good wi&s;hes for the people, and to exhort in a more private way, as I might have opportunity, and a fre&s;h concern on my mind. The&s;e grounds of he&s;itation de|tained me till a friend kneeled down to conclude the meeting in prayer.</P>
<P>I then &s;aw clearly that if the meeting &s;hould break up without my uttering the exhortation, which was fixed with &s;o much weight upon my mind, I &s;hould unavoidably incur the &s;tings of con&s;cious guilt, and the crime of di&s;obedience.</P>
<P>Therefore not attending to the friend's public prayer, my mind was earne&s;tly and clo&s;ely exerci&s;ed in mental &s;upplica|tion

to the Almighty, that he would abi|litate me to be faithful. I had a hard &s;truggle and conflict on this occa&s;ion: but at length the power of divine faith prevailed, to the &s;hutting out and putting to &s;ilence all manner of di&s;couraging ap|prehen&s;ions. And when the prayer was ended I dur&s;t not &s;it down, fearing I &s;hould not have power to ri&s;e again in time; but turning about to the meeting, and &s;eeing &s;ome of the people &s;taring me in the face, &s;uch was my weakne&s;s, that I rai&s;ed up my hat, and holding it before my face, I &s;poke the words, which had lain with weight on my mind and &s;at down. A flood of divine joy poured into my heart, and filled it all the day: I went in this frame of mind into &s;everal friends' fami|lies, and my heart being &s;till melted with divine love, the tears of joy and thank|fulne&s;s &s;lowed down my cheeks, which &s;ome ignorantly mi&s;took for trouble of mind, &s;aying one to another, <HI>they pitied me.</HI></P>
<P>It was indeed a memorable day to me: for I &s;eemed to my&s;elf to be rai&s;ed above the &s;ordid and &s;inful inhabitants of this world, and to be admitted a partner of the ble&s;&s;ed &s;ociety of &s;aints and angels, and &s;pirits of ju&s;t men made perfect

through entire obedience rendered to their God.</P>
<P>I had a full a&s;&s;urance in my&s;elf that if then &s;udden death &s;hould &s;eize me, I &s;hould immediately go to that ble&s;&s;ed &s;ociety, to live in a holy and happy communion with them for ever, to adore that God and Sovereign, who had &s;o in|finitely favoured us. And this is the very nature of that truly excellent religion, which our dear Redeemer came to ble&s;s mankind with.</P>
<P>I might give &s;ome &s;mall account of &s;er|vices, and good effects, ari&s;ing from my thus obeying the divine manife&s;tation; but accounts of that kind I leave to tho&s;e, who have &s;teered more &s;teadily than I have done, and think it more proper for me to look to the other &s;ide of my ca&s;e, and that with &s;hame and confu&s;ion of heart, mixed with humble admiration of divine Goodne&s;s, which has hitherto in|deed been great, and ble&s;t me with a few heavenly and good days, wherein I &s;hould not have been afraid of death, or of the awful and tremendous judgment which is to follow it. Oh! that I may (through faithfulne&s;s on my part) attain the like again, and that my la&s;t day may be my be&s;t day!

the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t, which teaches divine wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>Being of an active natural di&s;po&s;ition, it became a cro&s;s to me to be &s;ilent, when it was be&s;t to be &s;o. And &s;ometimes after I &s;tood up I continued too long, till the te&s;timony as to the life of it, flattened and grew tedious to the hearers. I want|ed too to imitate &s;ome others, who, I thought, preached finely. Thus the ene|my of man's happine&s;s continually &s;eeks to tempt every cla&s;s in the church mili|tant. As the eye is kept &s;ingle to the holy Head, and the body full of light, in the light he is di&s;covered in all his ap|proaches and transformations; but I was not con&s;tantly enough on my guard again&s;t his &s;tratagems, and therefore was &s;ometimes &s;educed even to think I did well, when I was zealous, though not ac|cording to true knowledge, nor to the honour of the great name of Chri&s;t our Lord: for he is mo&s;t honoured by the &s;ubjection of &s;elf; and by divine love, coupled with humility and patience.</P>
<P>Among the many good in&s;titutions which the di&s;coveries of cele&s;tial wi&s;dom have e&s;tabli&s;hed in our &s;ociety, that of faithful elders appointed to watch over the flock, and over the mini&s;try, has been found to be very u&s;eful. And though the

love of &s;elf-honour made me &s;ometimes bear hardly the reproof of a friend; yet I have afterwards, as in the cool of the day, di&s;cerned the expediency of it, and been induced to de&s;ire to be more careful in future, and to be willing to receive advice, as well as to give it.</P>
<P>O ye, whom Chri&s;t calls into the work of the mini&s;try, or any other office, give up your lives to him and it, both to do and to &s;uffer what he may order or per|mit: for the ve&s;&s;els of the Lord's hou&s;e are to be of <HI>beaten</HI> gold. Every &s;on whom he loves he rebukes and cha&s;tens. Then ever receive with a good mind the coun&s;el or the reproof of a friend.</P>
<P>If others revile and taunt in bitterne&s;s and wrath; in haughtine&s;s and in&s;ult, as whoever will live godlily in Chri&s;t Je&s;us mu&s;t &s;uffer per&s;ecution; yet all things will work together for good to them that &s;teadily abide under Chri&s;t's government. &mdash;Our nature having in it much dro&s;s, and by long habit contracting an encrea&s;e of it, cannot be refined from it, but by fiery trials, nor have its evil humours purged out, but by drinking the bitter cup.&mdash;Applau&s;e plea&s;es the creature, but greatly endangers it. Suffering in &s;pirit, though more painful, is more &s;afe.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="018146_0231_0FA55FCEE0951080">O then ye! who have rightly begun, and favourably advanced in the work of truth or of the mini&s;try, look well to your &s;tanding, and guard again&s;t the transformations of your unwearied enemy.</P>
<P>When we fir&s;t began, our &s;ingle view and de&s;ire was to obtain divine approba|tion, and that peace of &s;oul, which re|&s;ults from it; to die to our&s;elves and all the world; to know no man after the fle&s;h, nor be known by them; but only to know the Lord, and to walk and act under his immediate notice and ap|proving favour.&mdash;But afterwards there hath mingled herewith, the de&s;ire of hu|man notice, of popular applau&s;e, of world|ly advantages and indulgences.</P>
<P>Thus too many mini&s;ters, as well as others, who have given up their names to follow the Lamb, have &s;lipped into a mixed &s;tate. In them the &s;pring once pure, hath become muddy, and the &s;acred fervour hath dwindled. Though they have retained the form of godline&s;s, yet its conquering power and fortitude have gradually died away, and left them as weak, and unable to re&s;i&s;t temptations, as tho&s;e who have never a&s;&s;umed that form.</P>
<P>This hath been the ca&s;e of too many dry worldlings and &s;en&s;uali&s;ts in our &s;o|ciety,
<PB N="46" REF="018146_0232_0FA55FCEF195D900">
who, far from helping the cau&s;e, which they profe&s;t a value for, have greatly hurt it, and given a handle to libertines to make both it and them, the &s;ubject of their deri&s;ion.</P>
<P>When the humble regard and love of God &s;ingly pre&s;ided in my heart, then I have been di&s;po&s;ed to receive the advice or the rebuke of a friend in the love in which it was given, and to bear with Chri&s;tian meekne&s;s, the taunts and in&s;ults of in&s;en&s;ible hearts and unguarded lips undi&s;turbed thereby: but when I have &s;lid off this foundation, then they have di&s;|compo&s;ed my mind, and agitated it with &s;elfi&s;h and unea&s;y re&s;entments.</P>
<P>I have not &s;o often met with this kind of returns to my mini&s;try, as applau&s;e, which indeed is an intoxicating and per|nicious cup for any to drink without great fear. It ferments the &s;pirits with a fal&s;e alacrity; elevates the mind with &s;elf-con|ceit, and an imagined &s;uperiority to others, leads into an evil emulation, and even to &s;light tho&s;e who are in a much better &s;tate, by dwelling in the valley of hu|mility, &s;ubject to Chri&s;t the beloved of their &s;ouls.</P>
<P>How hard for the creature not to be plea&s;ed with prai&s;e, and to offer it to him, to whom alone it is due! or after being at

any time &s;ignally honoured, to return like Mordecai di&s;mounted, &s;tripped of the royal robes, and to &s;it in a &s;ilent, abject condition at the king's gate, waiting on him in poverty of &s;pirit.</P>
<P>As applau&s;e is dangerous, &s;o the affec|tions of the people, if not kept under proper government, both by the mini&s;ter and his hearers, have a &s;nare in them, as indeed hath every object of our &s;en&s;es, without maintaining an inward watchful|ne&s;s; the&s;e things not being the proper mark or prize of a mini&s;ter or a chri&s;tian. It is ba&s;e to play the harlot with corrupt &s;elf, and deck it with the Lord's jewels. For if we take the&s;e rewards of our la|bours, we are in danger of lo&s;ing that which he gives to the faithful, which is the one true and durable reward.</P>
<P>The &s;pirit of the go&s;pel directs us, to &s;ubmit our&s;elves, or give way, one to another, to be aba&s;ed, and prefer others; the &s;trong to take the weak by the hand, and all to imitate the holy pattern of Chri&s;t, who was meek and lowly in heart, and &s;tooped to wa&s;h the feet even of his di&s;ciples and &s;ervants.</P>
<P>It was he by his &s;pirit, that not only rai&s;ed up a living mini&s;try in our &s;ociety, but by the &s;ame &s;pirit animated our faith|ful predece&s;&s;ors to e&s;tabli&s;h a &s;alutary

di&s;cipline therein, upon the &s;ame founda|tion; and rai&s;ed up and gifted men and women for valuable &s;ervices, conducing to the edification and &s;trengthening of one another in piety. Often have I &s;at in meetings of di&s;cipline greatly humbled, tendered and revived in my &s;pirit, with fre&s;h re&s;olution to renew diligence in my journey heaven-ward.</P>
<P>One branch of this di&s;cipline, viz. the in&s;titution of meetings of mini&s;ters and elders, I highly regarded. For when we have (in a &s;en&s;e of our entire inability without his help) pro&s;trated our&s;elves to|gether before the mo&s;t high God, he hath graciou&s;ly vouch&s;afed to open the living &s;prings of coun&s;el, &s;uitable to the &s;everal &s;tates and &s;tations pre&s;ent, tending to &s;tir up to diligence and devotedne&s;s in his &s;ervice, and pointing out livelily in the opening of go&s;pel light, the &s;nares and dangers waylaying the &s;piritual traveller in his journey.</P>
<P>Often have the&s;e meetings, when we have been thus prepared for them, ce|mented us together in an humble engage|ment of &s;oul toward God. Tender love hath abounded, which hath made us dear one to another, as children of one fa|mily, and fellow-labourers in the highe&s;t and be&s;t cau&s;e. Chri&s;t our Lord has
<PB N="49" REF="018146_0235_0FA55FD36CEC5DC0">
favoured us with his pre&s;ence, and &s;o|vereign power, and made us partakers together of his heart-tendering goodne&s;s, and of a near communion, and divine fellow&s;hip with him through his &s;pirit, and with each other therein, to the re|newing our ardent concern for the ho|nour of his name, and the promotion of his truth.</P>
<P>But when this preparation hath been wanting, and inattention and ab&s;ence of mind have taken place, then we have been barren as the dry heath; and like the earth, covered with darkne&s;s, without form and void, when the &s;pirit of the Lord moved not on the face of the waters. Both the immediate and in&s;trumental &s;prings of lively and clear coun&s;el and con&s;olation have been clo&s;ed up, and the edification and watering of the flock with|held. This hath cau&s;ed living zeal, and even the attendance of them to decay, and to yield to temporal affairs and temptati|ons, to the hurt and lo&s;s of many.</P>
<P>May the&s;e con&s;iderations move both mini&s;ters and elders more particularly, to &s;eek after the preparations requi&s;ite for their a&s;&s;embling in the name and power of Chri&s;t, and under a renewed concern for their individual pre&s;ervation, as well as for that of their brethren and &s;i&s;ters,
<PB N="50" REF="018146_0236_0FA55FD5DAA99B78">
that they may thereby be comfortably en|livened, and enliven one another to all goodne&s;s, as men and women redeemed from the world, and fellow-citizens of the New Jeru&s;alem. Then, of great and va|luable benefit indeed, would the&s;e &s;olemn meetings be, as heretofore, when faithful labourers in the Lord's &s;ervice, dignified, adorned and upheld them.</P>
<P>When I had re&s;ided about three years in Ireland, my brother John, whom I left in the &s;ervice of Thomas Bennett, at Pick wick, Wilts, as noticed before, being de&s;irous to fix his re&s;idence in the &s;ame nation at lea&s;t with me, at the expi|ration of his fourth year there, re&s;igned his place of u&s;her to that &s;chool, in order to remove to Ireland, and going fir&s;t to &s;ee our mother (and relations) at Kendal, &s;he concluded to accompany him in order to pay us a vi&s;it of a few weeks, and about the middle of the &s;ummer 1740, they both arrived at Cork. After about five weeks abode with us, my mother in|clined to return home; and I having a concern on my mind to vi&s;it my native country in the &s;ervice of Truth, and my brother's arrival opening the way to &s;et me at liberty; he willingly taking charge of my &s;chool in my ab&s;ence, I concluded to accompany my mother in her return:

<P>In the cour&s;e of this journey I was fa|voured with the company and counte|nance of &s;undry friends, whom in my younger years I had held in e&s;timation, by rea&s;on of the good impre&s;&s;ions I re|ceived from their exemplary lives and labours, as before noted in its place. My quondam ma&s;ter, David Hall, treated me with affectionate re&s;pect; he had buried his former wife, who was my mi&s;tre&s;s, and married again. He and his wife accom|panied me to a meeting at Airton. I lodged at Thomas Ander&s;on's, a friend in the mini&s;try, who vi&s;ited Ireland in compa|ny with David Hall; he was blind, but exceeding plea&s;ant and chearful.

<P>In his young years (having been edu|cated in the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion or church of England &s;o called) he had conceived a very contemptible opinion of the people called Quakers and their principles, and at a public hou&s;e or inn, falling in com|pany with &s;ome others of like &s;entiments, this people became the &s;ubject of their di&s;cour&s;e; and as they were expre&s;&s;ing their &s;entiments of contempt and di&s;like of them pretty freely, a per&s;on of &s;ome note, who had been an officer under Oliver Cromwell, came into the room and over-hearing their di&s;cour&s;e, ob&s;erved to them in &s;ub&s;tance, <Q>That he upprehended their prejudice towards this people aro&s;e from their want of knowing them: for my part (continued lie I entertain

After the battle of Dunbar, as I was riding in Scotland at the head of my troop, I ob&s;erved at &s;ome di&s;tance from the road, a crowd of people, and one higher than the re&s;t; upon which I &s;ent one of my men to &s;ee, and bring me word what was the meaning of this gathering and &s;eeing him ride up and &s;tay there, without re|turning according to my order, I &s;ent a &s;econd, who &s;tayed in like manner, and then I determined to go my&s;elf. When I came thither, I found it was James Naylor preaching to the people; but with &s;uch power and reaching energy, as I had not till then been wit|ne&s;s of. I could not help &s;taying a lit|tle, although I was afraid to &s;tay; for I was made a Quaker, being forced to tremble at the &s;ight of my&s;elf. I was &s;truck with more terror by the preaching of James Naylor, than I was at the battle of Dunbar, when we

had nothing el&s;e to expect, but to fall a prey to the &s;words of our enemies, without being able to help our&s;elves. I clearly &s;aw the cro&s;s to be &s;ubmitted to, &s;o I dur&s;t &s;tay no longer, but got off, and carried condemnation for it in my own brea&s;t. The people there, in the clear and powerful opening of their &s;tates, cried out again&s;t them&s;elves, imploring mercy, a thorough change, and the whole work of &s;alvation to be effected in them. Ever &s;ince I have thought my&s;elf obliged to acknowledge on their behalf, as I have now done.</Q></P>
<P>This, James Wil&s;on &s;aid, proved the fir&s;t &s;tep towards his convincement of our principles, inclining him to go to our meetings, which before he had an aver&s;ion to the thoughts of, from the prejudice above hinted. In tho&s;e days the meetings of friends were more eminently favoured with divine power, as they lived more devoted to Chri&s;t; and con&s;equently more abounding with his love flowing in their hearts.</P>
<P>I was ready to think that I&s;aac Alexan|der had been in&s;trumental to his con|vincement. I find it recorded in the third volume of the <HI>dying Sayings,</HI> that &s;aid I&s;aac died at his hou&s;e. Of him he gave me the following account, that <Q>being

in him&s;elf an illiterate ru&s;tick, &s;oon after his convincement, he appeared in the mini&s;try lively and powerful. A neighbour of his, having heard of his becoming a preacher, could not tell-how &s;ufficiently to expre&s;s his admira|tion; he made it the &s;ubject of his di&s;|cour&s;e from place to place, deriding him who had no learning for pre&s;uming to preach, and the people for &s;uffering him.</Q></P>
<P><Q>This man attended the funeral or that great and good woman, Ann Camm. The meeting proved an ex|ceeding enlightening, tendering oppor|tunity: and even this derider was con|trited and humbled therein. I&s;aac Alexander was eminently rai&s;ed up in his gift, to &s;et forth the goodne&s;s, and the ju&s;tice of God: the glory of Truth, the happine&s;s of obeying it, and the la&s;ting infelicity of neglecting and re|belling again&s;t it. The man was &s;o thoroughly penetrated with a clear &s;ight of his own ca&s;e, that after I&s;aac had done, he &s;tood up in that very a&s;&s;embly; acknowledged the crime he had been guilty of, and begged the prayers of all good Chri&s;tians, that it might be for|given him.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="018146_0245_0FA55FDD2A7BA7F8">I mo&s;tly fini&s;hed my &s;ervice in England in this journey, with the quarterly meet|ing for Lanca&s;hire, at Lanca&s;ter, and that for We&s;tmoreland, at Kendal, held in &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion. At the former, I met with Abra|ham Fuller, of Dublin, who had accom|panied Mo&s;es Aldridge from New-Eng|land, in his religious vi&s;it to friends in Scotland, and was now, as well as my&s;elf on his return home; our meeting being quite unexpected, was a very plea&s;ing &s;ur|prize to us both; e&s;pecially, as we were like to be companions to Dublin. Here al&s;o, I met with Samuel Fothergill, then young in the mini&s;try; but even then ap|pearing with that &s;olemnity, brightne&s;s, and go&s;pel authority, as gave friends live|ly hopes of his proving, as he did, through the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;tages of his life, a bright and &s;hining light, a ve&s;&s;el of honour in|deed, of eminent &s;ervice in the church of Chri&s;t.

<P>From Lanca&s;ter we went directly to the quarterly meeting at Kendal, which was al&s;o a good meeting, and the begin|ning

of the &s;ucceeding week, we proceed|ed to Whitehaven, in order to take &s;hip|ping for Dublin, where we arrived on &s;eventh day following, and I lodged at Jo&s;eph Gill's. I attended the meetings there the next day, and heavenly help being near, I was furni&s;hed with ability and matter, to mini&s;ter to the general &s;a|tisfaction and edification of friends, and the ea&s;e of my own mind. And my be|ing at that time quite a &s;tranger to mo&s;t friends in that city, and coming quite un|expected, occa&s;ioned pretty much enquiry among them.</P>
<P>From Dublin I proceeded toward Lime|rick, by Mountmelick, Mountrath, and Kilconinmore, where John A&s;hton was then living, a valuable good man, little inferior to mo&s;t I have known in my e&s;timation. Although not eminent for great and &s;hining parts; yet he was a &s;hining light in the country where he re|&s;ided, in love and good works; a man of great humility, and &s;ervour of &s;oul for the promotion of piety; much beloved and e&s;teemed of his neighbours and friends.</P>
<P>When I came to the good old man's hou&s;e, (being now near eighty years of age) he was very much indi&s;po&s;ed; and it being about the middle of the eighth

month O. S. or October, and the friends in that part being late with &s;ome part of their harve&s;t, he propo&s;ed notwith&s;tand|ing his infirmity, to accompany me to Limerick: a great day's journey for him when he was well, as the roads were then: and his relations, apprehending it too ha|zardous for him to undertake under his pre&s;ent indi&s;po&s;ition, endeavoured to di&s;|&s;uade him from it: which made me de&s;i|rous that he might not &s;uffer in his health, nor meet with any di&s;&s;atisfaction of mind.</P>
<P>It proved a fine day. He grew much bet|ter, and his conver&s;ation was very edifying. Our friends at Limerick rejoiced greatly to &s;ee him, being the la&s;t time of his be|ing there. Next day being fir&s;t day, we had two comfortable meetings there. On &s;econd day morning at parting, he told me "He was well paid for coming." He was well and hearty the winter following, and the next &s;pring &s;et forward towards the half-year's meeting at Dublin, but having reached Birr, he found him&s;elf unable to go further, returned home, and after a &s;hort illne&s;s departed this life, leaving behind him a general te&s;timony all round the country on his behalf, as of one who had eminently &s;erved God, loved
<PB N="62" REF="018146_0248_0FA55FE51B48DD00">
mankind, and was greatly beloved by al|mo&s;t every one that knew him.</P>
<P>He and his wife were both convinced at one meeting at Birr, through the pow|erful mini&s;try of that able and eminent mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel, Thomas Wil&s;on. Coming out of that meeting, they &s;aid to each other, <Q>The way of everla&s;ting happine&s;s had been clearly laid down before them, and they were re&s;olved to walk in it, come life or come death.</Q></P>
<P>Not long after, John was thrown into pri&s;on for his chri&s;tian te&s;timony again&s;t the oppre&s;&s;ive and antichri&s;tian yoke of tithes; here, being u&s;ed to work without doors, he was at a lo&s;s how to employ his time; but &s;oon learned to make gartering and laces.</P>
<P>When at liberty, he with his wife, con|&s;tantly twice a week attended the meeting at Birr, generally walking on foot thither, being about &s;even Engli&s;h miles and very bad road, wading through a river in the way both going and returning. In winter in cro&s;&s;ing this river they &s;ometimes had the ice to break; and John &s;aid he had wept to &s;ee the blood on his wife's legs in coming through it. In tho&s;e days truth was precious to its profe&s;&s;ors, who al&s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it, and no difficulties or dangers, could prevent them from getting to their
<PB N="63" REF="018146_0249_0FA55FE56DC22068">
religious meetings, to enjoy the renewings of divine love and life, with their bre|thren.</P>
<P>This good man al&s;o took great pains to get travelling friends to appoint meetings at his hou&s;e; and then to acquaint peo|ple thereof &s;everal miles round, travelling for that purpo&s;e by night, as well as by day, in the winter &s;ea&s;on, and in &s;evere weather, and underwent much reproach for this labour and diligence of his.</P>
<P>Yet he was ble&s;t in it, both inwardly and outwardly, many came to the meet|ings at his hou&s;e, &s;everal were convinced of the truth, and in proce&s;s of time a meeting was &s;ettled there, and grew larger than that of Birr, out of which it had &s;prung.</P>
<P>He was at the time of his joining our &s;ociety but in low circum&s;tances: but through indu&s;try and the ble&s;&s;ing of hea|ven he grew rich, and did abundance of good, being &s;ingularly ho&s;pitable, liberal, and charitable.</P>
<P>At the above&s;aid meeting at Birr, thro' the mini&s;try of Thomas Wil&s;on, there was al&s;o convinced his wife's daughter Mary, the wife of James Sheppard. This was a great mortification to her hu&s;band, who tried various means to reclaim her. At length a noted preacher being to
<PB N="64" REF="018146_0250_0FA55FE652EAD988">
preach at the wor&s;hip-hou&s;e he frequent|ed, he propo&s;ed to his wife, that if &s;he would go with him to hear him, he would go with her next Sunday (as he called it) to the meeting at Birr, to which propo&s;al &s;he a&s;&s;ented. She went accord|ingly, and heard fine words and elo|quence: but that was not what her &s;oul wanted.</P>
<P>Next fir&s;t-day pur&s;uant to his engage|ment he went with her to Birr. It proved to be a &s;ilent meeting there: yet thro' the reverent attendance of the &s;ouls of tho&s;e pre&s;ent upon Chri&s;t the be&s;t mini&s;ter, they were favoured together with his life-giv|ing pre&s;ence, with the &s;en&s;e of which, the &s;aid James was reached, and tendered in|to contrition in the &s;ight of the &s;elf-deny|ing path ca&s;t up to peace with God. Hereupon, what he little expected at his going to that meeting, he immediately joined in &s;ociety with friends, and became a &s;erviceable man in his &s;tation.</P>
<P>After parting with John A&s;hton, I pro|ceeded toward Cork, and reached it next morning before meeting.</P>
<P>Soon after I vi&s;ited &s;ome parts of Lein|&s;ter province. After my return I &s;pared my brother, at the reque&s;t of Benjamin Wil&s;on near Edenderry, to be tutor to his children, and tho&s;e of a neighbouring

friend. When he had been there about a year and a half, I writ to him to pre|pare (after duly apprizing his employers) to return to Cork, having a de&s;ire for once, while I had an opportunity (of his &s;upplying my place) to be at the Welch, Bri&s;tol, and London yearly meetings, and though the family was loth to part with him, yet as I wanted him on this account, he di&s;engaged him&s;elf and returned to Cork, in due time for me to proceed on the &s;ervice before me.</P>
<P>Accordingly in the beginning of the fir&s;t month, O. S. (now called the third) I embarked on a &s;ixth day morning at Cork: On &s;eventh day at night by fa|vour of the light-hou&s;es we got into Mil|ford-haven. On fir&s;t-day morning I walk|ed to Haverford-we&s;t, where I met with Abraham Fuller of Dublin, whom I con|&s;ulted how I &s;hould &s;teer my cour&s;e to North-Wales, as I under&s;tood here, that the Welch yearly-meeting was to be about a month from this time in this neighbourhood, viz, at Tenby in Pein|broke&s;hire.</P>
<P>Abraham advi&s;ed me to order my cour&s;e &s;o, as to be at John Goodwin's on a fir&s;t-day, becau&s;e there was generally a large re&s;ort of people there on that day, and gave me his directions how to

accompli&s;h it, which I was plea&s;ed with, having heard before of that good old man, and having a de&s;ire to be then at his hou&s;e.</P>
<P>On third day after meeting I left Ha|verford-we&s;t, had a meeting next day at Carmarthen: on fifth day morning went to John Bowen's at Penplace, expecting to have a meeting there, but he being gone to their monthly meeting at John Reece's at Penbark, I followed him thi|ther, where I found a con&s;iderable num|ber met: After I had &s;et down, old John Reece &s;tood up and preached to us in Welch. On &s;ixth day I went to the wi|dow Evans's at Llandewy-brevy, in Cardi|gan&s;hire, and expected next day to reach John Goodwin's, at E&s;cargogh in Mon|mouth&s;hire.</P>
<P>Next morning the friend who was to have been my guide came into my cham|ber long before day, when I was about getting up, having an earne&s;t de&s;ire to reach John Goodwin's that day. He in|formed me <Q>I could not go thither that day without running the ri&s;que of my life, as it &s;howed very hard, and it was a mountainous road.</Q> I pre&s;ently got up, and found my&s;elf obliged to &s;tay there, to the no &s;mall di&s;appointment of my de&s;ire.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="018146_0253_0FA55FE8720D9558">I then went to their ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">et-town cal|led Tregarron, and there had two meet|ings that day, the latter of which was large. Next day being fir&s;t day, hearing of a prie&s;t called Daniel Rowland, who&s;e pari&s;h wor&s;hip-hou&s;e was at Llangeithow, three miles beyond Llandewy-brevy, who was much flocked after by many people, even from other pari&s;hes, thither I went accompanied by three friends. When we arrived we found the hou&s;e full, and ma|ny at the out&s;ide, who &s;eemed to li&s;ten to the preacher with attention, who was preaching in Welch. I de&s;ired a young man to endeavour to get in to the Par&s;on, and acquaint him that an Engli&s;hman without, wanted to &s;peak to him, which I &s;uppo&s;e he did. For when he had ended his &s;ermon the congregation broke up, and he came out one of the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>I went to meet him and told him, <Q>I had found my mind drawn in chri&s;tian love to vi&s;it him and his congregation, and therefore de&s;ired then the oppor|tunity to deliver to him and them what was on my mind.</Q> After &s;ome enquiries he &s;aid <Q>It was not convenient then, as he had him&s;elf preached largely to the people.</Q> Finding my&s;elf clear of him, I got upon a pretty high tomb|&s;tone, and the people generally drew near,
<PB N="68" REF="018146_0254_0FA55FE92B3AC1D8">
being a very large multitude. The op|portunity was greatly favoured, I being engaged to invite the people to Chri&s;t the free teacher, and of him to receive wine and milk (&s;trength and nouri&s;h|ment to their &s;ouls) without money and without price: tho' the people &s;tood clo&s;e crowded, there &s;eemed to be as great a &s;tillne&s;s, as if &s;carce any were there. After I had ended what at that time flowed thro' my heart to them, I &s;tood a little with my mind reverently and thankfully affected. At length I looked round to &s;ee on which &s;ide I might mo&s;t ea&s;ily retire. Some of the people near, who perceived it, de&s;ired that <Q>I would pray for them before I left them.</Q> I an&s;wered that <Q>I did indeed pray for them, but as for doing it vo|cally, I dur&s;t not, unle&s;s it appeared at that time to be my duty &s;o to do.</Q> They a&s;ked then <Q>Whither I intended to go next,</Q> I told them <Q>To Llambeter (about five miles off) where I intended to have a meeting that afternoon.</Q> Thither many of them went.</P>
<P>When I had got a little way on the road, I was overtaken by one, who look|ed like a gentleman, on hor&s;eback, with his wife riding behind a man on another hor&s;e, he told me <Q>He had come out of
<PB N="69" REF="018146_0255_0FA55FE9EBFF3AB8">
Carmarthen&s;hire fourteen miles over the hills to hear Daniel Rowland, a&s;k|ing if I &s;hould come into that county, that if I did he would meet me any where in it, if he could know the time and place; but would be better plea&s;ed if I could come and lodge a night with him,</Q> which I afterward did.</P>
<P>As I advanced a little further, a certain woman not of our profe&s;&s;ion, invited me and friends with me to dine, and gave us the be&s;t entertainment in her power. She expre&s;&s;ed with &s;olidity, <Q>She had not under&s;tood one word I had &s;aid; but had felt that which had done her heart good, as a friend interpreted her words to me.</Q></P>
<P>Many people flocking to Llambeter, the meeting was held in the &s;treet. After it I parted with the people in mutual af|fection, and returned to Llandewy brevy in company with friends and others. I was at this time much overcome with the Lord's goodne&s;s, and thankful for the afore&s;aid di&s;appointment of my de&s;ire, as believing it to be in the ordering of be&s;t wi&s;dom, for the &s;ervice of the day, being filled with a comfortable hope, I was in my proper place, which cau&s;ed the tears to run down my cheeks, mo&s;t of the way I had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ride.</P>

<P><PB N="75" REF="018146_0261_0FA55FF23B088898">Having parted with John Goodwin, I went to Shrew&s;bury, Colebrooke-dale, Bewdley, Worce&s;ter, Birmingham, Co|ventry, Warwick, Eve&s;ham; then back by Worce&s;ter to Bromyard, Hereford, Amely and into Radnor&s;hire in Wales, to Brinfloyd and Talcot. To this la&s;t place came Mary Rickaby of York&s;hire from Llandewy-brevy, much tired; but after a little re&s;t and refre&s;hment, &s;he had an edifying opportunity in the family; and from hence &s;he, with Miriam Bowen, and her uncle Edward Jones accompa|nied me to the Welch yearly meeting, as did al&s;o John Young from Leomin&s;ter, who met me at Hereford for that purpo&s;e, and was an acceptable companion.</P>
<P>Next morning we &s;et out from Talcot about five o'clock and got to Nathaniel Anthony's a little after meeting time, a meeting having been appointed before-hand there, to begin at five in the even|ing. After meeting John Young and I went to lodge with that couple, who had before invited menear Llangeithow, where we met with a kind and cordial reception, and found them fervent in de&s;ire after godline&s;s. Next morning we met Mary Rickaby, and &s;undry other friends at John Bowen's. Thence went to an evening
<PB N="76" REF="018146_0262_0FA55FF2F7913C28">
meeting at Carmarthen, which was large. Next day being &s;eventh day, we went to John Lewis's hou&s;e in the country; on fir&s;t day with him to the meeting at Red|&s;tone, and in the afternoon were at a large meeting at Haverford-we&s;t: And front hence on third day we went to the yearly meeting at Tenby.</P>
<P>After the yearly meeting, I went by Swanzey and Trevereeg to Pontipoole, being accompanied by good old Evan Evans. Thence by Shernuton and Ro&s;s to Glouce&s;ter, and from thence round by Oxford&s;hire, Berk&s;hire and Wilt&s;hire to Bri&s;tol yearly meeting; and from thence by Bath, Bradford, Shaft&s;bury, Poole, Ringwood and Southampton and the I&s;le of Wight, to that of London.</P>
<P>At Shaft&s;bury the meeting had been pretty much dropped for &s;everal years, there being none of our profe&s;&s;ion left, but an old friend a tanner and his two &s;i&s;ters: but at this time &s;everal were in part convinced, and thereupon the meet|ing revived. I was there on a fir&s;t day, and had three meetings which were large. The &s;econd day I &s;pent in vi&s;iting families, and in the evening had a conclu&s;ive meet|ing with friends, and tho&s;e newly convin|ced. It was a &s;atisfactory time; and one man's wife who had been in great grief,

pa&s;&s;ion and bitterne&s;s, on account of her hu&s;band's joining in our profe&s;&s;ion, was her&s;elf gained and joined him and friends; and another woman likewi&s;e joined us at the &s;ame time: yet the fervency which was then felt, proved but of &s;hort dura|tion with &s;everal of them. However the meeting hath continued, a new meeting-hou&s;e was built there &s;ince that time, and the quarterly meeting of the county of Dor&s;et is &s;ometimes held there.</P>
<P>On my return from the I&s;le of Wight, Thomas Whitehead and Philip Eliot met me at Port&s;mouth and accompanied me thence to London, with young Abel Hollis of the I&s;le of Wight, who was then hope|ful, next day being the fourth of the week we came to Alton; after meeting there on fifth day we came to an evening meet|ing at Godalmin. Sixth day morning were at a meeting at Guilford. After meeting, being joined by Samuel Bownas and Jeremiah Waring, we came to E&s;her, and next morning to London to the year|ly meeting.</P>
<P>In this journey Samuel Bownas was particularly kind and fatherly to me. We were together at Gracious-&s;treet meeting on fir&s;t day morning, which was a good meeting, and wherein I was favoured in a good degree.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="018146_0264_0FA55FF46CBBF720">Thomas Whitehead and Philip Eliot accompanied me after the yearly meeting was over to a meeting at Hertford. From Hertford I went to Hitchin, Jordan's, High-wiccomb, &amp;c. was at the quarterly-meeting at Okeham for the counties of Leice&s;ter and Rutland, and at tho&s;e at Lincoln, York, Lanca&s;ter and Kendal.</P>
<P>At this yearly meeting were no repre|&s;entatives from Ireland, but Abraham Fuller and I. John Pim of Edenderry and his brother Jo&s;hua Pim of Mount|rath came as far as Coventry: and there the &s;aid Jo&s;hua, a valuable friend and elder, was vi&s;ited with a di&s;temper, which for a time &s;eemed dangerous. He reco|vered, but not till &s;ome time after the yearly meeting was over.</P>
<P>The like afterwards happened to ano|ther good friend and elder Jo&s;eph Wil|liams of Randal's Mills, who reached Lon|don, and was there by indi&s;po&s;ition pre|vented from getting out to any meeting, &s;uch trials being &s;ometimes permitted for the proving and exerci&s;ing the &s;aith and patience of the Lord's &s;ervants.</P>
<P>In this journey I often travelled hard, and had two meetings a day wherever I could. It took me about five months. At Lincoln quarterly meeting friends lodg|ed
<PB N="79" REF="018146_0265_0FA55FF54C2CD240">
at inns: I don't remember that I knew one friend there, but John Scott from Leeds, and May Drummond. It being now about mid&s;ummer, the pub|lic meeting began at twelve o'clock, their men's meeting about two, and ended be|fore four. In tho&s;e two meetings I had been &s;hut up. I met with an elderly friend and a&s;ked him, how friends &s;pent the re&s;i|due of the long evening, he an&s;wered <Q>In conver&s;ing together or taking a walk or the like.</Q> I told him <Q>I thought it was a pity, con&s;idering the large num|ber of young people come together from &s;undry parts of the county, that I thought the end would be better an|&s;wered, by &s;ome religious opportunity, or meeting, that might tend to edifi|cation, and be of benefit to &s;ome at lea&s;t.</Q> He replied <Q>They u&s;ed to have evening meetings; but being on one hand much infe&s;ted with rude people, and on the other too often weakly conducted, they proved di&s;&s;atisfactory; and for the&s;e rea&s;ons friends had thought it be&s;t to di&s;continue them.</Q></P>
<P>Hereupon we were called in to dinner; but I had little appetite: after dinner I was called out. Some of the elders had drawn together, and upon my coming to them, &s;ignified if I had a concern for an
<PB N="80" REF="018146_0266_0FA55FF5E9C5C578">
evening meeting, that they were willing to appoint one to begin at the &s;ixth hour. I was afraid yet dur&s;t not refu&s;e the pro|po&s;al, &s;o upon my a&s;&s;enting, the meeting was appointed, it was much crowded, and the life and power of truth was in domi|nion, which ea&s;ed my mind of its burden and filled it with thankfulne&s;s.</P>
<P>From hence John Scott, May Drum|mond and I, came together with divers other friends to a meeting at Gain&s;bo|rough, and on the fir&s;t day after, were at the general meeting at Warn&s;worth, where we met with Jo&s;eph Storr. From thence John Scott and I came together to the monthly meeting at Leeds, where we met with our valuable ancient friend William Slater. From Leeds I went in company with William Hird and his wife to the monthly meeting at Knare&s;borough, at which was John Fothergill, and from thence to the quarterly meeting at York, to which came in particular John Richard|&s;on, expected by few, having been thought to be near death for &s;ome time before, but being recovered a little, tho' &s;till very feeble in body, but &s;trong in faith, and warm in love to God and the brethren, in a journey of three days, which he had u&s;ed to accompli&s;h in one or le&s;s, he
<PB N="81" REF="018146_0267_0FA55FF967E6E3B8">
reached this city, to have one more &s;o|lemn opportunity with his friends at this meeting.</P>
<P>In the meeting of mini&s;ters the good old man was enlarged in much weighty and pertinent coun&s;el in the clear opening of Go&s;pel light, but the public meetings were much hurt by raw and forward pub|lic appearances.</P>
<P>From York I came with Mary Slater to Skipton, and from thence was accompa|nied by John Binns to a general meeting at Cro&s;habooth, where I met with Samuel Fothergill, Margaret Birtwhi&s;tle (after+wards married to Jonathan Rain) and Sarah Routh, who afterwards married William Taylor: next day in company with the two la&s;t to the quarterly meet|ing at Lanca&s;ter.</P>
<P>Here in the meeting of mini&s;ters Mar|garet Birtwhi&s;tle appeared livelily and very &s;uitably: but a young man and one elder than he, by their public appear|ances hurt the meeting.</P>
<P>When I reached Whitehaven, I there met Su&s;anna Morris and Elizabeth Mor|gan of Penn&s;ylvania ju&s;t landed from Dub|lin having vi&s;ited Ireland. Su&s;anna Morris was a good old woman and a &s;ound mini&s;|ter, who&s;e faith was remarkably tried; hav|ing twice &s;uffered &s;hipwreck on the coa&s;t
<PB N="82" REF="018146_0268_0FA55FFAEB6AF998">
of Ireland and once (as I have heard) on the we&s;tern coa&s;t of Europe; yet was pre|&s;erved by that power and providence on which &s;he relied, and her faith not weak|ened thereby.</P>
<P>One time it happened in the north of Ireland, and the other time off Dungarvan, when, (as I have been credibly inform|ed) after hanging &s;ome hours in the &s;hip's &s;hrouds, apparently in imminent danger of being &s;wept away by the waves every minute, and the &s;torm continuing &s;o vio|lent that no boatmen dur&s;t venture out to their relief, a popi&s;h prie&s;t was made the in&s;trument of her pre&s;ervation, who by his influence and authority rou&s;ed &s;ome of the inhabitants, at the ri&s;que of their lives to attempt the relief of her and others, which they providentially effected, and brought her and Jo&s;eph Taylor par|ticularly, &s;afe a&s;hore.</P>
<P>When I landed from Whitehaven at Dublin, I there received a letter from my brother, informing me that their next province meeting was to be at Limerick next fir&s;t day. Garret Ha&s;ten accom|panying me, we le&s;t Dublin on fourth day morning and came that evening to Samuel Neale's at Chri&s;tian's town, and were next day at the week-day meeting at Rathangan, and after meeting went to
<PB N="83" REF="018146_0269_0FA55FFC4F793650">
John Ridgeway's at Ballycarrol; next day we reached Ro&s;crea, and Limerick, the day following. At this province meeting I was prevailed on to &s;tay and join in a vi&s;it to friends' families, towards which &s;ervice Garret had before expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome concern on his mind. We were accom|panied by Jo&s;hua Beale of Cork, John Philips, George Pea&s;e and William Rich|ard&s;on of Limerick. It proved a memo|rable &s;ea&s;on: The pure influence of truth having prevaled in the preceeding pro|vince meeting, had &s;o prepared friends' minds, that we found in general great openne&s;s and in &s;ome families &s;carce a dry eye. No hardne&s;s, that I remember, ap|peared, except in one family: and the head of that family, being an eager pur|&s;uer of the world, in &s;ome time after failed con&s;iderably in debt. From thence I came &s;traight home to Cork.</P>
<P>On the whole of this long journey, and my third with a certificate, I have this ob&s;ervation to make. In my two fir&s;t journeys being much among tender reli|gious friends, my labour was ea&s;y and edifying, and I often had great con&s;ola|tion, and divine &s;atisfaction among them: but in this la&s;t, coming to many places that were poor and flat, as to the life of religion, and where other things more pre|vailed,
<PB N="84" REF="018146_0270_0FA55FFCFA518120">
I often had &s;uffering &s;ea&s;ons, and came off but poorly.</P>
<P>In the next &s;ummer after my return, I removed from Cork (leaving my &s;aid bro|ther John Gough there in my place) into Lein&s;ter province, and &s;ettled near Mount|melick.</P>
<P>I have good rea&s;on to believe that I followed right direction, and the gracious call of divine goodne&s;s, in this removal, on divers accounts, as in the good hand of God, the author of all good, it prov|ed a ble&s;&s;ing both to my wife and my&s;elf. There lived hereaway at that time divers valuable &s;piritually-minded friends, thro' who&s;e tender regard, coun&s;el and help we gained fre&s;h good, and to whom we felt great nearne&s;s of heart, and dear affec|tion, in the pure love of the one eternal &s;pirit.</P>
<P>Here I tried &s;omething of the linen-bu&s;ine&s;s, but found my&s;elf &s;o unfit for dealing with the common people, that I &s;aw (notwith&s;tanding the kind a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome friends) I was not like to gain any thing by following this bu&s;ine&s;s. And as I had little el&s;e at pre&s;ent for a liveli|hood, it &s;ometimes &s;pread a dejection over my mind. Such di&s;pen&s;ations are hum|bling, deeply exerci&s;ing our faith and pa|tience, and proving our foundation and
<PB N="85" REF="018146_0271_0FA55FFD6BDF1440">
our confidence in divine protection, and reliance on heavenly help. They are what we generally call trials; and &s;o they are: but when we con&s;ider that the earth is the Lord's and the fulne&s;s thereof, and that the cattle of a thou&s;and hills are his; are not his favours trials as well as his cha&s;ti&s;ements? Affluence appears to me a trial as well as di&s;couraging outward pro&s;pects; but a trial of a different nature, that is of our fidelity as &s;tewards of the mercies of God, to whom we are all to be accountable for the di&s;charge of the tru&s;t he hath inve&s;ted us with, that we con&s;ume them not upon our lu&s;ts, as if that was our own, which was given us to do good with, and be helpful to others who may &s;tand in need; and as the &s;un&s;hine of pro&s;perity is apt to li&s;t men up too high into a &s;tate of incon&s;ideratene&s;s and di&s;&s;ipation, I have thought it as a trial, whereby we are un|der greater danger and temptation: and have a greater cro&s;s to take up to be what we ought to be, than in humbler &s;tations. It has not fallen to my lot to be much proved with trials of this kind, and I am led to believe that divine wi&s;dom, who or|ders all things well, knew be&s;t what was be&s;t for me. For when pro&s;pects of things were plea&s;ing I was too prone to be too much elevated, and therefore needed to
<PB N="86" REF="018146_0272_0FA55FFE32F428B0">
be brought and kept low: but in the mid&s;t of my di&s;couragement, a door of hope often opened to me, from the inter|nal evidence and per&s;ua&s;ion of my being in my right place, and of faith that all things would work together for good, if we were pre&s;erved thro' all to love and fear the Lord, and &s;o I humbly tru&s;t it proved. For my wife under the like di&s;|couragement being brought low in her mind, it proved in the hand of God a good &s;tep to her to the more certain en|joyment of his ble&s;&s;ed pre&s;ence, and the comforts of his good &s;pirit: She meeting with the like precious vi&s;itation here, as I had done before in Bri&s;tol, which made us partakers together, of the &s;weet &s;en&s;e of the gracious regard of him that is above all, and clo&s;ely linked us together in true unity, and deep thankfulne&s;s, which often rai&s;ed in us (to our un&s;peakable joy) the cheering hope of a dwelling-place, with the &s;anctified of the Lord in the regions of bli&s;s. May I never forget &s;uch &s;ea&s;ons of unmerited mercy and goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>In the &s;pring of the next year, my mind was again drawn to vi&s;it &s;ome parts of Cumberland and We&s;tmoreland. John Pim of Lackah and his wife offered me their elde&s;t &s;on Mo&s;es for a companion, which I accepted. We met at his brother-in-law
<PB N="87" REF="018146_0273_0FA55FFEEC1D7CD0">
Samuel Neale's at Chri&s;tian's town. Thence we went next day &s;ome miles out of our way to &s;ee our dear friend Mary Pei&s;ly being at that time in affliction.</P>
<P>She had been a gay young woman, but in the youthful years of her gaiety, &s;he was favoured with a powerful and prevail|ing vi&s;itation of divine love, and giving up faithfully to the heavenly vi&s;ion, &s;he became a ve&s;&s;el of honour in the ma&s;ter's hou&s;e, receiving a gift in the mini&s;try, and being reverently, watchfully and live|lily exerci&s;ed therein to the edification of friends where her lot was ca&s;t. She was indeed an u&s;eful member and a &s;hining ornament to the church.</P>
<P>I am ready to conclude, that none in out day, from the time of this the effec|tual vi&s;itation of Chri&s;t to her &s;oul, ad|hered with more &s;teadine&s;s to his guidance, through a variety of probations. She was mo&s;t part of her time a member of the &s;ame monthly meeting with my&s;elf. Of|ten were we together in public meetings; often on family vi&s;its.</P>
<P>She vi&s;ited friends in England, Ireland and North America pretty generally; and &s;oon after her return from her la&s;t journey married our friend Samuel Neale, and in a few days after departed this life. I at|tended both at her marriage and her fu|neral,
<PB N="88" REF="018146_0274_0FA55FFFE9C23F20">
and am &s;atisfied that &s;he is gone to enjoy for ever the reward of a well-&s;pent life, very much devoted to the &s;ervice of God, and the promotion of truth upon earth.</P>
<P>After this vi&s;it of friend&s;hip, we got to Dublin on &s;eventh day evening, and there on enquiry I was informed at &s;everal pla|ces, that the whole fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">et of Whitehaven &s;hips had gone off that day; but in my return from the quay (accompanied by my kind landlord Thomas Strangman) met a man, who told us there was one prevented from getting off. So I &s;tayed the two meetings in Dublin the next day, and had a &s;atisfactory time with my dear friends there. After dinner on &s;econd day we embarked, and on third day about noon landed at Whitehaven. That afternoon I went to John Harris's, and next morn|ing &s;et off with him and his wife, a va|luable mini&s;ter, to the quarterly meeting at Carli&s;le.</P>
<P>One thing appeared to me plea&s;ingly remarkable at that time. By rea&s;on of wet weather, people there were backward at their country work, and then very bu&s;y, yet &s;everal of the men, put for|ward their wives to go to the quarterly meeting, as they intended them&s;elves to the northern yearly meeting to be at Ken|dal
<PB N="89" REF="018146_0275_0FA56001565F2088">
about two weeks from that time. We were that day pretty many in company, but more women than men, tho' both the roads and the weather were but indiffer|ent. Hence I concluded that no other motive, but that of religious de&s;ire drew them from home. It affected my mind, and made me hope for a good meet|ing. The widow of our worthy friend Robert Atkin&s;on, then about eighty years of age, with two other elderly women walked on foot eight miles to it.</P>
<P>On fifth day the quarterly meeting be|gan, and on &s;ixth day ended, and was a large and good meeting. On &s;eventh day I reached Kendal, and vi&s;ited meetings thereaway till the yearly meeting; and after it &s;pent a few days thereabout, took leave of my poor mother, and never &s;aw either the place of my nativity or her any more. She lived only about two or three years after this, and was favoured in her latter days with peace and quiet; which was mercifully continued to her la&s;t end.</P>
<P>This journey began well, like all my others; but, alas! it did not &s;o continue and end, for want of my &s;teadily adhering to the all-wi&s;e guide in my whole conduct. Yet I received in&s;truction from it, and learned to exerci&s;e more care in &s;ome
<PB N="90" REF="018146_0276_0FA56001ED43DC30">
things, wherein I &s;aw I had mi&s;&s;ed my way.</P>
<P>I embarked at Whitehaven for Dublin; but we were driven to the north, and put into Carlingford about fifty miles from Dublin. The pa&s;&s;engers were three men and three women, and this being a poor place, we could only get two mean wretched hor&s;es, on which we helped the women by turns to Dundalk about eight or ten miles. From Dundalk we hired three hor&s;es, which carried double well to Drogheda where we lodged. Here were no hor&s;es to be met with. So meeting with a return chai&s;e I agreed for the three women to go in it, and my&s;elf &s;etting for|ward on foot in company with one of the pa&s;&s;engers, I arrived in Dublin in good time, and was at the half year's meeting there which was a &s;atisfactory &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>Still &s;eeing little or no pro&s;pect of get|ting any thing by the linen-bu&s;ine&s;s, one morning Thomas Boake &s;choolma&s;ter of Mountmelick came to acquaint me, that the doctor had told him he mu&s;t qui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the &s;chool or lo&s;e his life (being then in a bad &s;tate of health,) and to advi&s;e with me and others thereupon. He &s;oon quitted it, and I &s;ucceeded him, in a &s;chool poor indeed, as I found it, at my fir&s;t entering upon it; for except a few friends who&s;e children <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="91" REF="018146_0277_0FA5600304B85BD8">
had, who duly paid me, mo&s;t of the re&s;t put me off with promi&s;es, few of which were ever performed; &s;o that a dull pro&s;|pect &s;till threatened, and looking back in my mind to both Bri&s;tol and Cork, I thought it a &s;trange condition to which I was now reduced: yet hope in the Lord &s;ometime &s;upported and cheered my mind; and it was not long till things began to wear a better face; for fir&s;t &s;ome friends of Dublin, and afterwards others from other parts &s;ent their &s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s to board with us, till we had above twenty boys board|ed in our hou&s;e, for whom we were well and duly paid.</P>
<P>About ten years after our marriage, my wife was delivered of a &s;on, whom we named John, and in a few days after, &s;he departed this life. For about two years before her decea&s;e &s;he had been engaged a little in the work of the mini&s;try; but her principal &s;ervice was in friends' fami|lies and in the women's meetings (in which her &s;ervice was much mi&s;&s;ed, when &s;he was removed.) She died in a &s;weet frame of mind, and in near unity with good friends.</P>
<P>My brother had married at Youghal a relation of my wife's, upon who&s;e death, he and his wi&s;e came into my hou&s;e at my de&s;ire, and in the winter following
<PB N="92" REF="018146_0278_0FA560038DABF448">
I vi&s;ited Ul&s;ter province pretty fully and thoroughly, being at &s;undry meetings twice over; in this journey I was favoured with the company of old Robert Richard|&s;on many miles, and to many meetings, in &s;evere weather, and he about eighty-four years of age.</P>
<P>I had a particular concern to have a meeting in the town of Belfa&s;t: I con|&s;ulted Robert upon it; but he did not en|courage it, not one of our profe&s;&s;ion liv|ing in that town: He &s;aid he had been at &s;undry meetings there&punc; but few of them proved to &s;atisfaction. So I left the mat|ter for &s;ome days; but the concern fol|lowed me &s;till. And it opened in my mind, that if I would have the bread of life to my &s;oul, I mu&s;t go to the place ap|pointed for me to receive it, viz. to Belfa&s;t.</P>
<P>I thereupon con&s;ulted &s;undry other friends, all of whom approved of it. Up|on application the town hall was obtained for it, and fitted up with &s;eats of deal-boards. Sundry friends attended from the meetings of Ballinderry, Li&s;burn, Hill&s;|borough, and Newtown, particularly from Li&s;burn &s;everal friends accompanied me, and old Robert could not be ea&s;y without coming along in the rear of the company; he &s;at next to me on the ju&s;tices' bench.</P>
<P>The magi&s;trates were &s;o favourable, as to order the con&s;tables to &s;tand at the door

to keep out the rabble: The inhabitants of the town of upper rank with their wives and children came to it in a decent &s;olid manner.</P>
<P>I had had a great weight and fear on my mind re&s;pecting the undertaking; but pro|ceeding on the foundation hinted above; a &s;teady hope and reverent dependence on the Almighty &s;tayed my mind, and I thought my friends felt for me, and felt unity of heart with me. The meeting was eminently favoured with the clear light of the go&s;pel, and the &s;weet &s;en&s;e and enjoyment of divine life and good|ne&s;s. After the meeting, Robert in a ten|der thankful frame of mind expre&s;&s;ed his &s;atisfaction, as did divers other friends.

<P>After this I had meetings of the like kind at Dungannon, Moira, and Legi|curry or Rich-hill, all of them open, and comfortable. And indeed in this vi&s;it to Ul&s;ter province, I was favoured often with the &s;upporting evidence of my being under right direction.

<P><PB N="94" REF="018146_0280_0FA56008A8DECC90">I was accompanied in this journey ma|ny miles and to many meetings by my e&s;teemed friend Thomas Greer, who&s;e company was truly acceptable; al&s;o by my dear friend Su&s;anna Hatton to &s;uch meetings as &s;he could get out convenietly to attend.</P>
<P>Sometime after I al&s;o vi&s;ited Mun&s;ter province, accompanied by my friend John Pim of Lackah.</P>
<P>About this time the Methodi&s;ts had got &s;ome footing in &s;undry parts of Ireland, and in Mountmelick in particular: John Curtis, a friend of Bri&s;tol, who had been one of them about a year, having been afterwards convinced of our principles, and received a gift of the mini&s;try, came over upon a religious vi&s;it to friends in Ireland, among&s;t whom his &s;ervice was very acceptable.</P>
<P>I was with him at a large meeting in the court hou&s;e in Athy, another in the a&s;&s;embly-room at Athlone, and at &s;everal others which were very large. He ap|peared in inwardne&s;s of mind to attend upon his gift, and follow its leading; and concluded his &s;ervice in Ireland with an epi&s;tle to friends whom he had vi&s;ited, which the national meeting ordered to be printed.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="018146_0281_0FA56008BAB743E8">I mention this by rea&s;on of what fol|lows.</P>
<P>One afternoon John We&s;ley made his fir&s;t entrance into Mountmelick, attended by a large company on hor&s;eback of tho&s;e who joined him in &s;ociety. As &s;everal of their mini&s;ters had been here before, &s;ome of whom had invited me to come, and bring my family, to hear them preach the go&s;pel, I had not as yet found freedom to go: but hearing that John We&s;ley was to preach that evening in the open market|place, I was not ea&s;y to avoid going. So I went, and &s;tanding at a friend's &s;hop-door, I heard him begin with the follow|ing preamble or introduction:</P>
<P><Q>Before I unfold to you the oracles of God I mu&s;t fir&s;t remove a &s;tumbling-block out of the way, which is this; I under&s;tand one John Curtis from Bri&s;|tol hath of late been travelling in the&s;e parts, and endeavouring to lay wa&s;te that good work, which it hath plea&s;ed God to carry on by our hands, giving out that he was formerly a Methodi&s;t and ac|quainted with me. Now he never was a Methodi&s;t to my knowledge, and I think he could not be one in or about Bri&s;tol without it: And as to any acquaintance with the &s;aid John Curtis, I &s;olemnly declare I never had any; only I remem|ber

being twice in his company occa|&s;ionally, about eight years ago. I hope no man will account me an offender for &s;peaking the truth. If George Fox were here he would embrace me for it.</Q></P>
<P>This was the &s;ub&s;tance of his introduc|tion in the &s;ame words, or very nearly the &s;ame, in which he delivered it, for I gave good attention to this part. Then he pro|ceeded to what he called unfolding the oracles of God, which I thought was &s;tamping the matter far too high.</P>
<P>That evening I got two friends to ac|company me to his lodging to &s;peak to him hereupon. At the fir&s;t mentioning of the &s;ubject he di&s;covered &s;ome warmth. <Q>I tell you John Curtis has done more harm in his journey thro' the&s;e parts, than ever he will do good as long as he lives. He has gone about &s;catter|ing poi&s;on.</Q> This high charge he un|dertook to prove thus: <Q>What poi&s;on is to the body, that bigotry is to the mind; but John Curtis has been indu&s;|trious to &s;ow bigotry, that is to &s;ow di&s;|affection in the hearts of chri&s;tians to|ward one another, barely on account of difference in opinion.</Q></P>
<P>To all this I replied to the following import <Q>I was an entire &s;tranger to John Curtis till he came into the&s;e parts,

&s;ince which I had made u&s;e of the op|portunity of contracting an acquain|tance with him, and being pretty much in his company, I have known him to be influenced with the univer&s;al love of God, and that he has endeavoured to propagate the &s;ame in others. This thou can&s;t never call &s;cattering poi&s;on; and if my account differ from thine, &s;o doth the foundation on which it is built.

<P><Q>I farther ob&s;erved to him that he ought to have duly regarded our Lord's directions not to judge, &amp;c.

<P>By the&s;e means chri&s;tian fortitude for &s;tanding &s;tedfa&s;t in a reverent &s;implicity and holy vigilance &s;oon retired; a &s;ilent dependance on Chri&s;t the true teacher was irk&s;ome, and that dependence which was due to him mi&s;placed on fallible men. The con&s;equence was a dwindling, a bla&s;t on the fir&s;t buddings of heavenly de&s;ires, a decay of the divine life: and many of them &s;oon returned, like the &s;ow that was wa&s;hed, to wallow in the mire and filth of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion again; and threw off the af|fectation, the in&s;ipid, and &s;urfeiting talk of religion; the form of godline&s;s, which

they had too much gloried in, for want of humbly abiding under the purifying pow|er thereof.</P>
<P>Sometime after this a vacancy falling out in the city of Dublin by the death of John Beetham friends' &s;choolma&s;ter there, and the return of George Routh (who had tried the place after him) to England, my brother being encouraged by friends there to take up the charge of that &s;chool, &s;eemed inclined thereto, and as the pro&s;|pect &s;eemed promi&s;ing, I freely a&s;&s;ented to his removal, altho' thereby I was left &s;ingly to undergo the labour and care of a large family of boarders, in which he and his wife had been u&s;eful a&s;&s;i&s;tants &s;ince the death of my wife. This induced me to think of marrying again, and accordingly I married Elizabeth Barnes, daughter of Thomas Barnes, of Waterford. About two weeks after our marriage we went to|gether to the &s;ummer half year's meeting in Dublin&punc; In our way thither we &s;pent the fir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> day among our friends at Tima|hoe, it being the la&s;t meeting there to ma|ny of them. For in a few days after, &s;eve|ral of their families came to Dublin to embark for North Carolina, to &s;ettle up|on my cou&s;in Arthur Dobbs's lands there, who was their landlord at Timahoe, and who upon my application, had offered to

me for life, and after it to my &s;on John and his heirs one thou&s;and acres of that land: Robert Millhou&s;e of Timahoe was to chu&s;e land, next to that, which him&s;elf &s;hould take, but the captain of the &s;hip in which they went, not being well ac|quainted with the coa&s;t, ran too far to the &s;outhward, landed them at Charle&s;town in South-Carolina, and thereupon they &s;ettled in that Province, &s;o I was di&s;ap|pointed in my expectation of getting the land taken up by him. Two other oppor|tunities afterwards pre&s;ented &s;ome proba|bility of getting them taken up; but by various accidents, my hopes were again di&s;appointed: may all di&s;appointments of this kind incite to a greater diligence in &s;eeking the one thing needful, that good part, which &s;hall never be taken away.</P>
<P>We re&s;ided about ten years after our marriage in Mountmelick; during which time an increa&s;ing private family, and the nece&s;&s;ary attendance of my hou&s;e and &s;chool, prevented my going any great journey, but I attended monthly, pro|vince, and national meetings generally, in which I was often favoured with my brethren, with the fre&s;h ari&s;ings of life, and the renewing of inward &s;trength.</P>
<P>My wife being of a very weakly and tender con&s;titution, I apprehended the fa|tigue

<P>Hereupon after &s;ome time, I threw up my &s;chool in Mountmelick, attended the fifth mo. national meeting at Dublin, after which I embarked there with three friends more, to attend the yearly meeting at Lon|don. We went aboard &s;hip on fifth day morn|ing, and landed at Park gate next morn|ing, and had an evening meeting at Liver|pool. On &s;eventh day went to Warrington: on fir&s;t day morning, to the general meeting at Franley in Che&s;hire. On &s;econd day we reached Birmingham; after meeting there on third day we went to Coventry. On fourth day after a meeting at Coventry, we reached Towce&s;ter, and London the next day. After the yearly meeting was over, I&s;aac Jack&s;on returned home; Jo&s;hua Wil&s;on &s;taid a little time among&s;t his re|lations; and Jo&s;eph Inman and I (accom|panied by our kind landlord John Elie <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of London) on third day came to an evening meeting at Reading, appointed to

Next morning Jo&s;eph Inman and I were at the monthly meeting at Newberry, and that evening at a &s;mall meeting at Marlborough; on fifth day we came to a meeting at Calne, and after it to John Fry's at Sutton-benjar. Next day after meeting there to Bath, and on &s;eventh day to Bri&s;tol, where we &s;tayed till &s;ixth day morning, when leav|ing Bri&s;tol, we cro&s;&s;ed the new pa&s;&s;age in|to Wales, that night came to Cardiff, and the next to Swanzey, were we &s;tayed over the fir&s;t day; and on a &s;econd day were at an evening meeting at Carmarthen.

We found her &s;pinning in her poor habitation, and &s;he &s;eemed rejoiced to &s;ee us, and as we had no guide, &s;he readily offered her&s;elf for a guide to John Goodwin's, which they called five miles: but it took us near three hours riding.</P>
<P>On fifth day after meeting at this anci|ent, worthy friend's hou&s;e, we went to his &s;on-in-law Humphry Owen's (on the &s;ea|&s;ide) who had married John's elde&s;t daugh|ter: On &s;ixth day after meeting, &s;aid Humphry accompanied us to his brother Lewis Owen's near Dolgelthy in Merion|eth&s;hire;

On &s;econd day morning about two o'clock our kind friend &s;aw us on board the packet-boat and then took leave of us. On third day in the evening we landed in Dublin, and next evening I got &s;afe home to my wife and children, in Mountmelick.</P>
<P>After my return I attended the quar|terly meeting for Mun&s;ter at Clonme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and that for Lein&s;ter at Enni&s;corthy, and then I got my large family ready for our removal, con&s;i&s;ting of my wife and her mother in her eightieth year, eight children, and a nur&s;e to the younge&s;t about eight months old. With the a&s;&s;i&s;|tance of &s;undry kind friends, particularly Thomas Strangman of Mountmelick, we all got well to Waterford, and from thence (after &s;taying about ten days with our friends there) to Bri&s;tol.</P>
<P>Now leaving Ireland, after having &s;o|journed there about twenty-four years, and received much affection and kindne&s;s from many friends there, of which I hope to retain the grateful remembrance as long as my memory &s;hall continue, let me re|view the &s;tate of our &s;ociety there, during that &s;pace of time.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="018146_0292_0FA560169588E0E0">At my fir&s;t going thither, there were yet living in mo&s;t parts of the nation, where meetings were &s;ettled, &s;ome of the good old &s;tock both mini&s;ters and elders, who loved God and mankind, and were e&s;teem|ed and beloved by them, being kind and open-hearted, as well as faithful and cir|cum&s;pect in all the branches of our chri&s;|tian te&s;timony, clo&s;ely uniting in tender love one with another, in &s;upporting it, and keeping things in good order in the church. Their pious care herein was like a fence about the flock, which kept them together in nearer unity and greater &s;afety: So that the young people in mo&s;t parts were generally trained up in innocence of manners, and in plainne&s;s of habit and &s;peech.</P>
<P>Some indeed, chiefly of the young men grown up, had for &s;ome time pa&s;t, refu&s;ed &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the good order e&s;tabli&s;hed; but I lived there long enough to &s;ee the unhappy con&s;equences thereof, both to them&s;elves, many of them, and to the body whereof they were members. What tho' their tables abounded with elegant di&s;hes, and variety of liquors: tho' they made a figure, and were envied or care&s;&s;ed for a time; yet mo&s;t of them were either cut &s;hort by death, or fell into di&s;grace.

<P>But tho' &s;ome of the&s;e were too big for the girdle of truth, to meet about them, or to be limited by the de&s;ires of their be&s;t friends; yet I found the di&s;cipline of the church better maintained, during my fir&s;t years in Cork, than before them in Bri&s;tol, tending to edification, brotherly comfort and love, and mutual encouragement in piety and virtue, with a joint de&s;ire and care to pre&s;erve an uniform regularity, and to revive and maintain a religious fervency toward God.</P>
<P>Some friends from the &s;everal parts attended their province meetings, which were held regularly once in &s;ix weeks, and circulated from one part to another, yet were mo&s;t frequently held in Cork.

<P>Their half year's meetings in Dublin were attended by &s;ome friends from mo&s;t parts of the nation. Here in their meet|ings for di&s;cipline, as well as for wor&s;hip, a zeal for the honour of God, and the good of the church pre&s;ided, and friends were ex|cited to keep all things in proper order in the church. The fir&s;t time I attended a half year's meeting was in the winter 1742, and it was indeed a lively good meeting, which I hope never to forget. After I removed from Cork to Mountmelick I attended the national, and provincial meetings for Lein|&s;ter pretty con&s;tantly, and often in them was affected with reverent gratitude to the Almighty, who by the di&s;coveries of the divine wi&s;dom in&s;tituted them for the &s;up|port and edification of the church, and in them frequently owned the gatherings of his people in his name, by the evident ma|nife&s;tation of his divine pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>In proce&s;s of time the&s;e worthy men and women, in who&s;e hearts the love of God

Of their &s;urvivors, on one hand, a con&s;iderable number retained the ancient plainne&s;s of language and ha|bit, and rigidly cen&s;orious of any deviation therefrom, valued them&s;elves thereupon, as if it were the only te&s;t and badge of di&s;ciple&s;hip, while their hearts were gone after their covetou&s;ne&s;s in eagerly pur|&s;uing, and &s;ordidly hoarding temporal wealth.

<P>Yet amid&s;t this inundation of negli|gence and revolt, there remain in mo&s;t places a number of &s;incere-hearted friends, a few worthy mini&s;ters and elders: but within the&s;e twenty years pa&s;t, there has been a great alteration for the wor&s;e.</P>

He, who had vi&s;ited my &s;oul, and called me into the mini&s;try, had given me a great place in the particular and near regard, affection and e&s;teem of friends in Ireland, where I had an open door, and was often much enlarged in go&s;pel love. Mo&s;tly attending the province meetings in Lein&s;ter, friends were rejoiced to &s;ee me, and apt to think me much mi&s;&s;ed, if at any time I did not get out to any of them. Whenever I did, I met &s;uch a welcome re|ception among&s;t friends (being often open|ed to their edification, and to our mutual

endearment to each other in the &s;weet &s;treams of divine life) and &s;uch ready at|tendance and kindne&s;s as were very plea|&s;ing to nature.</P>
<P>But coming from thence to Bri&s;tol, where I was now become a &s;tranger to many, and where they were full &s;ed as to vocal mini&s;try, I was here very much &s;hut up, and for a &s;ea&s;on &s;eemed to have lo&s;t the care&s;&s;es, cordial invitations, and that place I had among&s;t friends in Ireland; which, however, tho' (in my pre&s;ent trying cir|cum&s;tances) a &s;eemingly additional di&s;cou|ragement, was not an unprofitable di&s;pen|&s;ation: for tho' it was the great favour of the Almighty, whereby I was opened among my friends to their edification, and their hearts opened towards me; yet herein the enemy artfully laid his &s;nares, and too much and too often prevailed over my un|watchful &s;oul to my inward hurt. For what are all the care&s;&s;es of mankind? Of &s;mall value in them&s;elves, and often inju|rious to them whom they plea&s;e, convey|ing hidden poi&s;on to the unguarded mind; while that which alone will &s;tand us in real &s;tead, and be of infinite advantage, is to get and keep the favour of the Al|mighty: may I therefore want, and even reject, whatever would plea&s;e, and nou|ri&s;h,
<PB N="113" REF="018146_0299_0FA55F172ECB5AD8">
that &s;pirit, which ought to come un|der daily mortification!</P>
<P>The inward near unity, &s;ympathy, e&s;|teem and affection of friends and brethren is a very grateful and plea&s;ing enjoyment; but it may be proper and good for us to be tried and proved with being &s;tripped of every leaning &s;tock, but the only &s;ure foun|dation, that we may thereby be driven to have recour&s;e to it, and keep our only &s;afe habitation there. May this, after a life &s;o to&s;&s;ed up and down, as mine has been, at length become my ca&s;e on any terms! and if it be, it will be more than worth all I have yet &s;uffered, were it many times more: For all el&s;e will be &s;oon over; but this will never end.</P>

<P>THUS far my decea&s;ed brother proceeded in the narrative of the tran&s;actions of his own life; I find by the papers in my hand, that (as noted in the preface) he drew up a review thereof at &s;undry periods, and commenced the la&s;t in the 66th year of his age; which, it's propable, had he lived to fini&s;h it, would have exhibited, in a continued narration, the &s;ucceeding occurrences of his life to near the pre&s;ent time; but he proceeded only a little way in the la&s;t review: and the former in his 54th year terminates here; I condole with the reader the want of this continuation by that hand, which only could give it with tho&s;e intere&s;ting reflections, re&s;ulting from a recollection of the feelings attending the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive occur|rences of his life; this is an advantage that no other hand can &s;upply, as no other

cured him al&s;o an open door for the re|ception of his labour and &s;ervice therein.</P>
<P>During this interval, in the year 1769 he met with a clo&s;e trial in the death of his de&s;ervedly beloved &s;on John; a young man of amiable manners, and valuable qualities beyond mo&s;t of his years, being ble&s;&s;ed with a good natural di&s;po&s;ition, and good capacity, well improved in his mino|rity by a diligent application to u&s;eful learning, under the tuition of his father and preceptor; to whom the ea&s;y ta&s;k of in&s;tructing him, hi&s; a&s;&s;iduity, and ready proficiency conveyed &s;ecret joy, and plea|&s;ing hopes of future &s;atisfaction in a &s;on, who gave &s;uch promi&s;ing omens of making an u&s;eful and honourable member of reli|gious and civil &s;ociety. Nor were the&s;e hopes fru&s;trated in the advancing &s;tages of his &s;hort life. For as he grew up, being favoured with &s;olid religious impre&s;&s;ions, he fought after, and attained be&s;t wi&s;dom to a degree, in general, exceeding his age. in this his entrance on the &s;tage of life, a propriety and &s;teadine&s;s of department, that might adorn advanced years, attract|ed the notice and re&s;pectful regard of the be&s;t friends who had the opportunity or ob&s;erving, or being acquainted with him. By a con&s;cientious di&s;charge of every &s;o|cial and religious duty, as a dutiful &s;on,

as an affectionate brother, as an exem|plary pattern of plainne&s;s, &s;obriety and circum&s;pection of life, he gave evident in|dications, he was early acquainted with the grace and truth, which came by Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>I apprehend he was for a &s;ea&s;on an a&s;|&s;i&s;tant to his father in his &s;chool: but the weight of care, and exerci&s;ing embarra&s;&s;|ment of this occupation, with the pro&s;|pect of encrea&s;ing care, as the weight thereof &s;hould devolve more immediately on his &s;houlders, not &s;uiting the pre&s;ent temper of his mind, di&s;couraged him from continuing in that line of life: and there|fore meeting with an encouraging offer from a friend in London, to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in his bu&s;ine&s;s in the capacity of a clerk, he removed thither: and there he laid down the body in or about the 21&s;t year of his age (as I recollect) having in this &s;tation, as well as every other, conducted him&s;elf with fidelity, reputation and honour: In te&s;timony whereof I have an extract of a letter, from his employer, to his father, communicated in one from the latter of tenth month 26th, 1769, as follows, viz.</P>

writes For my own part I don't much expect his recovery, which is a great affliction to me on divers accounts: yet I hope to be re&s;igned to the will of pro|vidence, being well a&s;&s;ured if he be re|moved it will he to his eternal gain, altho' my very great lo&s;s as well as thine, and many others, by whom he is dearly beloved. Oh! that my life, and that of all that know him may be like his, that at our death we may &s;ay as he did to my wife; <HI>I have done all that had to do, and mu&s;t now go home.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Soon after he died ; and in my brother's next letter he writes me the following ac|count of his funeral. <Q>My &s;on's John's funeral was uncommonly remarkable. It was taken to the new meeting hou&s;e at Park in Southwalk. The meeting was exce&s;&s;ively crowded, and many without doors It was attended by &s;e|veral public friends, many friends from &s;everal meetings in the city, and ma|ny out of the country from the love they bore him: the opportunity by all accounts was eminently favoured, the &s;ervice thereof falling to the lot of our worthy well qualified friend, Samuel For<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hergill, to the tendering the hearts of many pre&s;ent.</Q></P>

<P>The&s;e &s;hort te&s;timonies to the memory of my decea&s;ed nephew, I thought pro|per to in&s;ert here; Fir&s;t, becau&s;e I am of opinion, had his father lived to continue his own account of the occurrences of his life &s;o far, he would not have omitted one, &s;o nearly affecting him; and it was my purpo&s;e to notice what I apprehend he would have done for edification, as far as I have materials. Secondly, I thought the delineation of &s;uch a character, might be of &s;ervice, to &s;ome of the youth of this generation, as an example for them to imitate; as an evidence that early piety may through divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, be attained, and that if we &s;eek it in &s;incerity, and

May the ri&s;ing youthhereby be incited, &s;o to number their days, as that they may apply their hearts unto wi&s;dom, in order to make timely preparation for their final change: and not &s;uffer them|&s;elves, to be &s;o far deluded, as to put off this nece&s;&s;ary work, to &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uture &s;tage of life, which they can have no a&s;&s;urance of attaining unto, rea&s;oning with them|&s;elves (thro' the &s;ugge&s;tions of the enemy) that gaiety, fe&s;tivity, and fle&s;hly liberties, being agreeable to their pre&s;ent age may be &s;afely indulged for a &s;ea&s;on, as they have much time to repent and grow &s;ober in; and that at &s;ome more advanced period, when gravity and &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s will be more &s;uitable to their years, they will then ap|ply

And then I am well convinced they would be weaned, not only from the lux|ury, di&s;&s;ipation, and gro&s;s enormities of the world, but from an affectation of, and conformity unto the vain amu&s;ements, manners and fa&s;hions thereof, which too many indulge them&s;elves in, to their hurt. Let them not &s;atisfy them&s;elves with an apprehen&s;ion, that they indulge only in

<P><Q>I have been now near four months clo&s;ely employed in vi&s;iting friends, thro' the four counties of Somer&s;et, Devon, Dor&s;et and Hants: and fat with friends at many of their monthly meet|ings, and the three quarterly meet|ings for Somer&s;et&s;hire, Dor&s;et&s;hire, and Hamp&s;hire, all which were large for the &s;ea&s;on of the year, and favoured by the ma&s;ter of our a&s;&s;emblies with that pow|er of love, which unites his true &s;er|vants every where in a holy concern for the honour of his name, and for the faithful &s;upport of that te&s;timony, he has called them to bear.</Q></P>

and ended well. I was thankful for having reached it. In the afternoon I was at Devon&s;hire-hou&s;e, the meeting was very large, and fre&s;h ability was given to treat with the youth and others, in the merciful opening of the pure &s;pring of the go&s;pel. Ye&s;terday I at|tended the &s;elect morning meeting, and in the afternoon the two weeks meeting.

I &s;hall be likely to be three or four weeks, in and about London, and when I am clear, I have the meetings of Berk&s;hire and Wilt&s;hire, to vi&s;it in my way home.

<P><Q>I have cau&s;e to be humbly thankful to the author of all our mercies, who hath been kind to me thro' my winter's travels, favouring me with good health, thro' all winds and weathers, and with a kind reception every where. At this city being entered into my proper la|bour and bu&s;ine&s;s, I have found that I could not retire hence, any &s;ooner than the day abovementioned, and I think I &s;hall not over&s;tay my time, but rather otherwi&s;e, having found an en|largement of heart beyond expectation, and having contributed to encrea&s;e the morning meeting of elders here, with a valuable addition thereto; tho' I found it hard labour thro' the diffidence and reluctance of &s;ome; yet the power and love of truth at length prevailed, to the &s;atisfaction and comfort of many good friends.</Q></P>
<P>I find accordingly that he got home on the 8th 3 mo. and in about a week after|ward took a turn to the quarterly meet|ing
<PB N="129" REF="018146_0315_0FA55F26D54962F8">
of Somer&s;et&s;hire at Gla&s;tonbury, and that for Wilt&s;hire at Devizes, and was at &s;ome other meetings in his way from one to the other.</P>
<P>The beginning of 4 mo. he left home on his intended vi&s;it to Ireland; he came to the quarterly meeting at Worce&s;ter, and thence by Birmingham, Coventry, Dud|ley and Stourbridge to Colebrook-dale, where he was at meetings at the New-dale and Old-dale, and vi&s;ited &s;undry families, accompanied by Daniel Ro&s;e.</P>
<P>From Colebrook-Dale, by Shrew&s;bury to Dolobran, where the meeting-hou&s;e was nearly full, the meeting began at 8 o'clock in the morning, and was very com|fortable. The next day he got to Llewin|dee to William Howel's, &s;on-in-law to the late worthy friend John Goodwin, (with whom John's widow was then living, being 83 years of age,) and had a meeting there, and from thence he went by Llaneedle&s;s to the Welch yearly meeting at Brecknock, which began on the 26th of 4th month: The meeting of mini&s;ters and elders, began, at 9 o'clock in the morning, and at three in the afternoon, a meeting of friends on|ly, and after it the men's meeting, which held till it was almo&s;t dark, and then ad|journed to the 7th hour next morning, when friends met again, and the, meeting
<PB N="130" REF="018146_0316_0FA55F29640F3768">
held till about nine. At ten the public meeting began in the Town-hall, was ex|ce&s;&s;ively crowded, and a &s;atisfactory meet|ing. This yearly meeting ended the 27th 4th month, and the half-year's meeting in Dublin was to begin the 1&s;t 5th mon. So he writes, <Q>William Howel and I came 41 miles after dinner, to Llaneedle&s;s, where on the 28th we had a large meet|ing in the town-hall or &s;e&s;&s;ion-room, beginning at 8 o'clock, which was much favoured. Margaret Jarman, and Mary Hunt, accompanied us from thence to E&s;cargoh, where we al&s;o had a me|morable opportunity, our hearts being much tendered together.</Q> On the 29th being &s;ixth day of the week, he &s;et off from Llewindee accompanied by Owen Owen &s;on of Humphrey Owen aforemen|tioned, and grand&s;on to John Goodwin, for Holy head, and that day, altho' they were detained &s;ome hours for the tide to fall, till they could cro&s;s a river in the way, and in cro&s;&s;ing which, they were for a good while up to the &s;addle &s;kirts, they reached Carnarvan, being fifty miles, that night, and Holyhead about eleven o'clock in the forenoon of &s;eventh day; went aboard the packet-boat, about two o'clock on fir&s;t day morning; but having little wind, did not get to Dublin till &s;e|cond

day evening being the &s;econd day of the 5th month and of the national meeting.</P>
<P>Of this journey in Ireland, he kept a brief diary; but not &s;o particular, as of the former thro' Wales, being only a &s;um|mary account of the meetings and places he was at each day, without any remarks on meetings, or occurrences to diver&s;ify the narration, and therefore I &s;hall be obliged to comprize the relation thereof, in a nar|row compa&s;s.</P>
<P>He vi&s;ited the meetings in cour&s;e; fir&s;t, by Edenderry, Rathangan and Ballitore, to the &s;ix weeks meeting at Carlow, and thence we&s;tward, to Ballimurry, and re|turned to the quarterly meeting at Eden|derry, in concert with his companion, Thomas Melhui&s;h. From thence they di|rected their cour&s;e towards the province of Mun&s;ter, by Tullamore, Birr and Kilco|ninmore to Limerick, and from thence thro' Mun&s;ter, fini&s;hing their vi&s;it to that province, at the province meeting at Wa|terford: thence thro' the county of Wex|ford, and &s;o into the county of Carlow, where Thomas Melhui&s;h and he &s;epara|ted, (at Ca&s;tledermot) Thomas's draft being to Ul&s;ter, and my brother's pre&s;ent concern, more to the adjacent parts of Lein&s;ter.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="018146_0318_0FA55F2AB1B85520">After parting with Thomas Melhui&s;h, he continued vi&s;iting friends in tho&s;e parts, till the province meeting of Wicklow, af|ter which, and &s;pending &s;ome days in Dublin, he went from thence to the pro|vince meeting for Ul&s;ter at Ballenderry, and returned pretty directly back to Dub|lin, without appointing any meeting in that province, and continued vi&s;iting meet|ings in different parts of Lein&s;ter province, chiefly till the en&s;uing quarterly meeting, which was held at Enni&s;corthy, and from thence proceeded directly to Waterford, to take &s;hipping for Bri&s;tol.</P>
<P>This vi&s;it took him up near four months, (for he embarked for Bri&s;tol, on or about the 24th 8 mo.) the greate&s;t part of which time &s;eems to have been employed in Lein|&s;ter province, having vi&s;ited mo&s;t parts thereof, at lea&s;t twice over.</P>
<P>Having as aforementioned, re&s;igned his &s;chool at Bri&s;tol, in order to be at liberty to di&s;charge what was pointed out to him as a duty: Now his &s;ervice being fini&s;hed, he was out of employment there, for the &s;upport of him&s;elf and family. The pro&s;|pect of this in his giving up to this &s;ervice mu&s;t, I imagine, have been a pretty clo&s;e trial of faith; as he could not at the time of his re&s;ignation have any apprehen&s;ion of the way which afterwards opened, for
<PB N="133" REF="018146_0319_0FA55F2B963C7D58">
their employment and &s;ub&s;i&s;tence: but knowing he was faithful who had called him into the &s;ervice, he was doubtle&s;s &s;trengthened to go forth in faith, and a humble dependence on him, whom he &s;er|ved for &s;upport, inwardly and outwardly; and in the due time, away opened for him to his &s;atisfaction. For by my removal from Dublin (where I had re&s;ided upwards of twenty-three years) to Li&s;burn, which hap|pened during his travels in this nation; the &s;chool there became vacant. Where|upon friends of Dublin made him propo|&s;als to undertake the care thereof; to which he agreed, and &s;oon after his return to Bri&s;tol, removed with his family to &s;et|tle in that city.</P>
<P>Where again the nece&s;&s;ary attendance of his &s;chool, confined him pretty much to the place of his re&s;idence, and parts ad|jacent; for the &s;pace of two or three years; till about the &s;ummer 1777, when his family being grown up, and mo&s;tly in a way to provide for them&s;elves; and his younge&s;t &s;on having gotten an agreeable place of apprentice&s;hip, he found his way open finally to relinqui&s;h the confining and exerci&s;ing occupation, of his &s;chool, in or|der to be more at liberty in the evening of his day, to accompli&s;h the remaining part of his day's work, again&s;t the termination

thereof: and from this time to his remo|val out of this life, he was much engaged to travel and labour among&s;t friends in the different quarters of this nation for the promotion of truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>And as he had not vi&s;ited Ul&s;ter pro|vince in his late vi&s;it to this nation; the di&s;charging of that debt was the principal &s;ervice pointed out to him, in the follow|ing manner, as he him&s;elf expre&s;&s;eth it in the introduction to his account of &s;aid vi&s;it.</P>
<P>Seventh mo. 1&s;t, 1777. A good friend from England lately told us, in a meet|ing, that our old copy books were &s;ullied, and too full of blots; that we &s;hould get new books to keep our accounts in, and keep them fair and clean, and I wi&s;hed with the Lord's a&s;&s;i&s;tance to do &s;o, viz. to have my heart and life made and kept clean.</P>
<P>I felt a longing de&s;ire to undergo a fre&s;h the "warning of regeneration,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Titus iii. 3.</NOTE>" in order to be favoured with <Q>the renewing of the Holy Gho&s;t.</Q> I thought that he who &s;aid to the blind man, <Q>Go wa&s;h in the pool of Siloam,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">John vii. 7.</NOTE></Q> &s;aid unto me, Go to the northern parts of Ireland, to vi&s;it what is left there of the profe&s;&s;ors of truth; and therewith infu&s;ed the new covenant, or

<P>Seventh mo. 18th. To-day we had a &s;ilent, but to me and &s;ome others I hope an edifying meeting, under the divine and &s;piritual mini&s;try of the great mini&s;ter of life and &s;alvation, who therein &s;et before me two &s;ervices, the one to procure &s;ome &s;ub&s;criptions for the relief of a poor fa|mily, which after meeting I &s;et about and &s;ucceeded in; the other my journey to the North, with a lively and fre&s;h encou|ragement thereto, under the con&s;ideration of the uncertainty of our time here, and that if my duty to God required me to be doing one thing in one place, and death &s;hould arre&s;t me doing &s;omething el&s;e in another place, how mi&s;erable would my &s;tate be! The covenant of my youth was now brought to my remembrance with a lively and affecting impre&s;&s;ion, in the lan|guage adopted by the prophet Jeremiah, &s;peaking in the name of the Lord, <Q>I re|member thee, the kindne&s;s of thy youth;

In the intervals of labour I loved to retire from all the world, to him my be&s;t friend, who was with me in my labour, in&s;tructing and helping me in it, and making hard things ea&s;y, &s;o that "I walked by faith, and not by &s;ight," my mind being in heaven, often overflowing with the effu&s;ion of his grace, and goodne&s;s. Under this enlivening recollection, an ar|dent de&s;ire was rekindled in my heart, to re|new my covenant, to return to my fir&s;t love; and do my fir&s;t works, in an unre&s;erved re&s;ignation, to do the will of God. And my heart was influenced with a wi&s;h, that our young people in general, might be induced to love religious retirement in or|der therein to become acquainted with the wonderful coun&s;ellor, who is mere readily met with therein, than in the crowds, commotions, and tumults of the world, and in their own experience prove, that <Q>It is good for a man that he bear the

<P>Eighth mo. 4th. I returned from vi&s;it|ing the families of Timahoe meeting, in company with Jo&s;eph Williams, wherein a divine vi&s;itation &s;eemed to be renewedly extended to them: It is much to be de|&s;ired, that they may duly embrace it, to come up in their duty, and to per&s;evere in well-doing, to the end of their days.</P>
<P>Such vi&s;its among our friends, under divine influence, are of &s;ervice, and wor|thy of being often performed, as tending to renew the bonds of friend&s;hip, in the truth; to provoke to love and good works, and as they are engaged &s;teadily to wait upon the Lord, frequently prove &s;ea&s;ons of renewing of &s;trength to the vi&s;itors, as well as vi&s;ited.</P>
<P>Two days after, viz. the 6th of 8 mo. he &s;et forward on his vi&s;it to friends of Ul&s;ter province, taking his way by the quarterly meeting for Lein&s;ter province, held at Moate; and after the conclu&s;ion thereof proceeded to Oldca&s;tle, Coothill and Ca&s;tle&s;hane, in each of which three

meetings he did not only labour among&s;t his friends in their public a&s;&s;emblies, but al&s;o vi&s;ited them in their &s;everal families&punc; From Ca&s;tle&s;hane, he cro&s;&s;ed over to Lur|gan, and was on fir&s;t day at the meeting there, it being their men's and women's meeting. At that meeting I met him, and it was to &s;ome an edifying &s;ea&s;on. From Lurgan, he went to Rathfriland, and vi&s;it|ed the families belonging to that meeting. From thence he came to Li&s;burn, and had a meeting there, next day at Hill&s;bo|rough. The three &s;ucceeding days were the quarterly meeting at Ballenderry, which he attended, and had acceptable &s;ervice therein. The following week, he took the meetings of Moyallen, Lurgan. Ballihagan, and Charlemount, in &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion, vi&s;ited &s;ome families, and was again at the meeting near Charlemount, on fir&s;t day following, which he ob&s;erves, was large like a province meeting. He conti|nued his cour&s;e, from thence, to Antrim quarter, and as the vi&s;iting of this quar|ter, was in a particular manner impre&s;&s;ed as a duty upon his mind, he vi&s;ited the meetings thereof, thoroughly, and all or mo&s;t of the families of friends thereaway. On the fir&s;t day, he was at Grange, of which he writ to a friend, <Q>We had a kind of general meeting at Grange

<P>He &s;pent about a week among friends, in this quarter. But (as I recollect) his vi&s;it both to &s;aid quarter in particular, and the province in general, was in &s;ome degree cut &s;hort, by the arrival of our friends Thomas Corbyn, John Town&s;end, and Jo&s;eph Roe, from London, John Storer from Nottingham, and James Backhou&s;e from the county of Durham, who came over in con&s;equence of an appointment of the yearly meeting of London, to vi&s;it the &s;undry meetings of di&s;cipline, in this nation. Which vi&s;it they entered upon at the men's and women's meeting, for that purpo&s;e, appointed at Li&s;burn the 10th day of 9 mo. this year, while my brother was engaged, in the neighbouring part of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ntrim quarter.

ea&s;y to accompany them to Antrim, and from thence to Lurgan; from whence they proceeded to Charlemount, to be at the men's and women's meeting there on fir&s;t day, and Ballihagan on &s;econd day. My brother &s;taying fir&s;t day morning meeting, at Lurgan, had al&s;o an evening meeting at Li&s;burn, appointed at the fifth hour, and next day at Newtown. Fourth day following, was with the Engli&s;h friends, at the men's and women's meet|ing at Lurgan, and next day came with them to that of Li&s;burn, held at Ballender|ry. The province meeting at Lurgan, &s;uc|ceeded by appointment, on &s;ixth, &s;eventh and fir&s;t days, over which he &s;tayed, and after that, and having a meeting at Rath|friland, in the market-hou&s;e, one more at Lurgan, and another at Moyallen, he re|turned to Dublin.</P>
<P>When he arrived at Dublin, he found Thomas Dob&s;on, (from near Carli&s;le, who had come over under a particular con|cern for that &s;ervice) engaged in a vi&s;it to friends' families in that city: upon his arrival, he joined him in the &s;ervice, and accompanied him to ninety families, he having vi&s;ited forty-&s;ix, before my bro|ther's return.</P>

Thus he was diligently engaged, mo&s;t part of his latter days, in almo&s;t a continued &s;eries of laborious &s;ervice in the church, either at home or abroad.</P>
<P>When we reflect upon the repeated vi|&s;its of this kind, which divers other friends from di&s;tant parts, as well as tho&s;e above|mentioned, from the fre&s;h and lively im|pre&s;&s;ions of duty, have been engaged in to friends, in the different quarters of this nation; leaving, or &s;ubmitting to be de|tained from every near connexion in life, to labour among&s;t us, in the work of the go&s;pel, not only in public, but from hou&s;e to hou&s;e; and often in the clear opening of our &s;tates, under the influ|ence of truth, even as from man to man, it &s;hould affect every con&s;iderate mind, with humbling &s;en&s;ations of thankfulne&s;s, to our beneficent Creator, for his unbound|ed loving-kindne&s;s, and mercy to us, as a people, under the view that altho' the profe&s;&s;ors of truth, many of them (one going to his farm, and another to his mer|chandize) have &s;lighted repeated calls,

<P>The next &s;ervice I find him engaged in, was a vi&s;it to the monthly meetings of Mountmelick, and Edenderry, in his letter to me dated 1&s;t month, 1780, he writes, <Q>In the very cold weather, which we have had, I vi&s;ited all the particu|lar meetings of Mountmelick and Eden|derry monthly meetings, and tho' I could not but lament the &s;tate of many

In his fir&s;t day's journey his guide dropped his &s;addle-bags, whereby being deprived of nece&s;&s;ary change of linen, &amp;c. for the journey before him, I was told it put him to a &s;tand whether to proceed or return home; and al&s;o upon &s;eriou&s;ly con|&s;idering the grounds he &s;et out on, and the validity of his commi&s;&s;ion; and upon con&s;ulting the oracle in his own brea&s;t, it was intimated to him, that he mu&s;t go forward, <HI>if his life went for it.</HI> And to the grounds, or motive of his journey, the fir&s;t meeting he had, was at Mount|melick, from whence he writ <Q>We had a good meeting here to day, which &s;eemed as a fre&s;h &s;eal to my commi&s;|&s;ion, and makes me &s;trongly de&s;ire I may be pre&s;erved, to attend &s;ingly to my duty, and faithfully di&s;charge it.</Q> From Mountmelick, he went by Ro&s;crea, Birr, and Kilconinmore, to Limerick to the province meeting for Mun&s;ter, which,
<PB N="148" REF="018146_0334_0FA55F3AE28E9690">
by the account he gave, was &s;aid to have been the large&s;t that was remembered in that place, many friends from Lein&s;ter attending it;&mdash;And further, <Q>The kind father and author of all our mercies, favours my mind with the &s;weet &s;en&s;e of his divine love, and a de&s;ire to fol|low and &s;erve him, who is a rich re|warder of all his faithful &s;ervants.</Q> Here being reque&s;ted by friends, to for|ward the family vi&s;it, he con&s;ented, there|in following the pointings of duty. On the fourth day, after the province meet|ing, in conjunction with divers friends of that province, he entered upon this exer|ci&s;ing &s;ervice; his &s;ucceeding labours in this and the following &s;ervice, may be be&s;t under&s;tood from extracts, from his own letters, written to his wife, during his be|ing engaged therein.</P>
<P>Limerick, 1&s;t 9th month, 1780.</P>
<P><Q>On fourth day, we began the family vi&s;it here, and that day, we had &s;ix &s;olemn opportunities; vi&s;iting &s;o many families, and ye&s;terday we followed the bu&s;ine&s;s clo&s;ely; having eight &s;olemn meetings, &s;ome of which held long, &s;o that it was near ten at night, when the la&s;t of them broke up. We hope that

two days more, will be &s;ufficient to fini&s;h the family vi&s;it here, &s;o after fir&s;t day, expect to be thoroughly clear of this part of Mun&s;ter, and on &s;econd day to proceed with the friends, who &s;tay with me here, to Cork. To look at the labour, in a &s;ervice of this kind, thro' &s;uch a very large increa&s;ing exten&s;ive meeting, as that of Cork, would appear very weighty, and almo&s;t terrifying, were it not for the earne&s;t, which the great and good ma&s;ter hath already given us: who hath led us along, in the &s;weet en|joyment of his own pure love, and there|in hath united our &s;pirits, and hath opened a door of utterance, to the reaching the witne&s;s, and tendering the hearts of many.</Q></P>

Under this di|vine favour, I have had a &s;trong de&s;ire, on the behalf of our children, that the great author of pure goodne&s;s, would incline their hearts more and more to their principal intere&s;t, and clothe their minds with the heavenly &s;en&s;e of his love, and with the humility becoming depending creatures, and enamour them with the beauty of truth, which will never wax old, that thro' its power, they might freely &s;acrifice to him, what he calls for; and not look after the temptations and vanities of the world; but have the eye &s;ingle to things infi|nitely more important, that therein they may be ble&s;&s;ed of the Lord, with his favour, which is better than all things el&s;e.</Q></P>

to divers families; particularly one young man, and his wife, who was not educated in our &s;ociety, but this day was reduced to tenderne&s;s, both &s;he and her hu&s;band.

<P>In his next letter, and the la&s;t he wrote, he gives an account of a current di&s;order, viz. the dy&s;entery, with which many had been &s;eized, and that it had followed him very clo&s;ely for &s;everal days. It &s;eems that, partly from re&s;erve, but chiefly, from a de&s;ire to accompli&s;h the remaining part of the &s;ervice before him, &s;o as to get through it in time, to return home, again&s;t the en&s;uing half-year's meeting; he &s;uffered this di&s;order to ga|ther &s;trength before he let it be known, to a degree of ob&s;tinacy, beyond the pow|er of medicine to remove: for although no care of attendance, or &s;uitable appli|cations, under the direction of &s;kilful phy|&s;icians were wanting, yet the&s;e proving in|effectual, he departed out of this tran&s;itory &s;tate of exi&s;tence, in much tranquillity of

mind, at the hou&s;e of his kind friend, Jo&s;eph Garratt, in Cork, on the 6th day of the 10th month 1780, and was buried in friend's burying ground, in the &s;uburbs of that city, the 9th of the &s;ame month, his funeral being largely attended by friends and many others, as I am inform|ed, by &s;ome friends from thence, one of whom writes, <Q>We had a &s;olemn oppor|tunity, the wing of ancient goodne&s;s being over the a&s;&s;embly, in the per|formance of the la&s;t office, due to the worthy decea&s;ed.</Q></P>
<P>Thus it plea&s;ed the divine Being, in who&s;e hands our lives are, to relea&s;e him from further labour, in the church mili|tant, and remove him from works to re|wards, leaving among his &s;urviving friends a good &s;avour; his removal being gene|rally regretted, and his memory greatly and exten&s;ively re&s;pected, by mo&s;t or all that knew him; being a man of meek|ne&s;s, humility and univer&s;al benevolence; kindly di&s;po&s;ed, and affectionate to his friends, and mankind in general, he in return, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed their affectionate regard and e&s;teem in a general way.</P>
<P>In his &s;pirit, he was pre&s;erved bright and living, thro' his conclu&s;ive labour, and to the la&s;t period of his life, by the accounts I received, from &s;ome of tho&s;e

who were &s;harers, and witne&s;&s;es thereof. My re&s;pected friend Samuel Neale, in &s;ympathy with our &s;orrow, for the lo&s;s of a near and ju&s;tly beloved relation, obliged me with an affecting epi&s;tle of condolence, in which he expre&s;&s;eth, <Q>It is needle&s;s to &s;ay, he is a great lo&s;s, in a &s;ociety ca|pacity he was fervent and devoted; his lamp was repleni&s;hed with oil, and it &s;hined as bright as ever in my judg|ment, he fini&s;hed his cour&s;e as a faith|ful &s;oldier; he fini&s;hed it, making war in righteou&s;ne&s;s. I was with him at Limerick, at our province meeting, and accompanied him, to the families there, pretty generally; he was like an overflowing &s;pring, and freely diffu&s;ed what he was made partaker of, among&s;t his friends and brethren, and all that came in his way. After which he came to our city, and the &s;ame &s;trength, zeal, and authority attended him, here in the public meeting, and more &s;elect opportunities I was at with him. He was at the labour, early and late, until forced to &s;ubmit to the encrea&s;ing infir|mity of body, I think he had fini&s;hed all to five families, when the great orderer of all things, gave him a relea&s;e from further militant labour in his church.

He was calm and compo&s;ed in his mind, &s;aid, <HI>he was re&s;igned to the divine will and was prepared for the event, relying on the mercy of God.</HI> He was certainly much favoured, by a divine qualifica|tion, and as the evening approached, his &s;un went down bright, which is the crown of all.</Q></P>
<P>And altho' he had his clo&s;e trials, and di&s;couraging pro&s;pects, in various &s;ea&s;ons of his life, as we may gather from the preceding pages, yet being through all enabled to &s;tay his mind on the Lord, he was pre&s;erved in peaceful re&s;ignation, and &s;afely brought through them all; and was favoured to enjoy the evening of his day, as to &s;ecular engagements, in &s;erenity, and calm repo&s;e, in a &s;tate of liberty to de|vote him&s;elf more fully, to the &s;ervice of truth, and to fulfil his mini&s;try to the edification of the churches in this nation: He lived to &s;ee his children well &s;ettled in marriage, to his full &s;atisfaction, or in a way to &s;upport them&s;elves reputably, if favoured with the divine ble&s;&s;ing upon their labours, and pre&s;erved in the fear of the Lord, which he de&s;ired for them, more than outward riches.

<P>Now the end of the&s;e publications, is not to extol the man, &s;o much as to re|commend righteou&s;ne&s;s to mankind, by pointing out the beneficial and happy effects thereof, in real life; and as the de&s;ire of happine&s;s, planted deep in our nature, is an univer&s;al affection of the

<P>UNDER a concern for the welfare of our religious &s;ociety, yet left in Ireland, I think it my duty, <Q>to &s;tir up the pure mind by way of remembrance.</Q></P>
<P N="1">I. In the fir&s;t place, I de&s;ire that none under our name, may be raw and igno|rant, at a lo&s;s, if a&s;ked what we profe&s;s, or what is our fundamental principle; but having the heart-felt experience there|of,
<PB N="158" REF="018146_0344_0FA55F4447455400">
"be ready always," (as a good apo&s;tle advi&s;es) "to give an an&s;wer," or a <Q>rea|&s;on of the hope that is in you, with meekne&s;s and fear.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Peter iii. 15.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>We profe&s;s to be a people called out of the corrupt &s;pirit, and cu&s;toms of the world, out of all evil words and works, to follow Chri&s;t, in a clo&s;e inward adhe|rence to the &s;ecret di&s;coveries, which he gives us of our duty; that as his faith|ful &s;ervants, we may enjoy his favour, both while here, and eternally hereafter.</P>
<P>And our fundamental principle is this, that as God has created us to be for ever happy, he hath be&s;towed his light, grace, or holy &s;pirit, to fit and prepare us for it. Hereby he teacheth us what to deny, and how to live, to attain this great and glo|rious end.</P>
<P>If we adhere to this divine gift, we &s;hall love him above all things, and other gifts and ble&s;&s;ings, as we ought to do. Parents will love their children in the Lord. Chil|dren will be an honour to their parents, by a well-guarded, and dutiful conduct. The young, and the aged, will be joined as brethren, in one good concern.</P>
<P>Thus would a holy harmony, be &s;een and felt, as formerly: And we, in that
<PB N="159" REF="018146_0345_0FA55F44EC1606A8">
peace, order and union, reverencing the Lord our God, &s;hould enjoy the &s;weet influences of his pre&s;ence, and the joy of his &s;alvation.</P>
<P>Why are we members of a &s;eparate &s;ociety, but to be more clo&s;ely connected with the divine &s;ource of all purity and goodne&s;s, walking in the light of the Lord, that it might &s;hine in our lives, as way-marks to neighbours and &s;ober enquirers, that they, being won by our good conver|&s;ation, may have cau&s;e to ble&s;s God on our behalf? Thus were many convinced of our principles, and drawn into our &s;o|ciety, even at the hazard or lo&s;s of all that was dear to them in the world.</P>
<P N="2">II. I think it nece&s;&s;ary, to enter upon &s;ome points more particularly, and to add &s;uch exhortations thereupon, as my pre|&s;ent concern may engage me to impart.</P>
<P><Q>Submit your&s;elves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's &s;ake:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Peter ii. 13.</NOTE></Q> actively, when not contrary to the law of God; pa&s;&s;ively, when it is oppo&s;ite thereto. This is conformable to the example of Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles, as well as of good men, in former ages, and of all the worthy mar|tyrs in later days.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="018146_0346_0FA55F45AB113CF0">The Jews complained of Chri&s;t, for tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing or breaking their laws: at la&s;t when Pontius Pilate &s;aid, repeatedly, "I find no fault in him," they an&s;wered, <Q>We have a law, and by our law he ought to die.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John xix. 4, 6, 7.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>From our fundamental principle, be|forementioned, proceeded our well-known principles, or te&s;timony for Chri&s;t our Lord, in its &s;undry branches, which it is our incumbent duty to bear, and to &s;hew forth to the world; as in the following in&s;tances.</P>
<P N="3">III. Our ble&s;&s;ed Lord commands us, "not to &s;wear at all." It is our duty firmly to obey his command, whenever we are tried herein, and rather to &s;uffer pa|tiently what human laws may inflict, than to take an oath, on any account what&s;oever. Thus Daniel and the three worthy Hebrews, cho&s;e rather to &s;acrifice their bodies to the lion's den, and to the fiery furnace, than to comply with the law of man, when it demanded a revolt from their duty, to their &s;upreme Sove|reign.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The law of man &s;ometimes re|quires <HI>wars and fightings,</HI> and actively to contribute thereto: but Chri&s;t com|mands us to love our enemies, and do to
<PB N="161" REF="018146_0347_0FA55F466BA07500">
all men nothing but what is good. As his profe&s;&s;ed &s;ubjects, we cannot therefore, actively contribute to military affairs. Our Lord &s;aid to Pilate, <Q>If my kingdom were of this world, then would my &s;er|vants fight.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John xviii. 36.</NOTE></Q> Again, whatever injuries or ill u&s;age we receive, we mu&s;t follow his pattern, not rendering reviling for re|viling, leaving vengeance to the Lord to whom it belongs. None among&s;t us, mu&s;t either fight, or do any violent action, tend|ing to provoke thereto. We mu&s;t tru&s;t in the Lord, and then he will di&s;cover the be&s;t means of helping and healing the evil in others, or animate us innocent|ly to bear our te&s;timony again&s;t it, where hearts are too hard to admit any offered help. In this ca&s;e our Lord a&s;&s;ures us, that great is our reward in heaven: for &s;uch u&s;age the righteous who were be|fore us, have met with.</P>
<P N="5">V. Our dear Lord commands his own mini&s;ters freely to give, as from him they freely receive; and he changeth not: a hireling man-made mini&s;try therefore, is none of his; nor can we join in &s;upport|ing it, as &s;uch. Tho' the law of man hath e&s;tabli&s;hed it, we ought to do as the apo&s;tles did, <Q>And to obey God rather
<PB N="162" REF="018146_0348_0FA55F478D736F88">
than man.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Acts v. 29.</NOTE></Q> The go&s;pel of Chri&s;t is free, not &s;ubject to worldly traffic. It can neither be bought nor &s;old. It is the pow|er of God to &s;alvation. It brings the &s;oul, which receives and &s;ubmits to it, into im|mortal union with the father of lights, by leavening it into his divine nature. That which &s;elfi&s;h prie&s;ts purcha&s;e and demand money for, is therefore not the go&s;pel; and their pretending it to be &s;o, is an art|ful impo&s;ition.</P>
<P>This with many other things of like kind, our ance&s;tors di&s;covered in the true light, and therefore (like holy Da|niel and his brethren) pa&s;&s;ively &s;ubmitted to the laws, which required the &s;upport of this impo&s;ition, and to the rigorous ex|ecution of tho&s;e laws. By their courage and con&s;tancy herein, they made the way &s;mooth and ea&s;y to us, our &s;ufferings being light, in compari&s;on of theirs. It was nothing but the love of God, that animated them cheerfully to &s;uffer great &s;poiling of goods, with long and hard im|pri&s;onments: &s;eparated from all that was near and dear to them in the world. It was in the &s;upport of their te&s;timony to the univer&s;ality of God's love to mankind, who invites them that are athir&s;t, and
<PB N="163" REF="018146_0349_0FA55F48250E9E38">
them that have no money, to come and buy wine and milk, without money and without price.</P>
<P>May their de&s;cendants and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, from generation to generation, come up after them, in the &s;ame noble cau&s;e. So would they mini&s;ter joy, to &s;uch as have no other intere&s;t in view, but the &s;piritual health and vigor of the body, and of every member therein. Some indeed of late years, have degenerated from that fidelity to God, which tho&s;e worthies ever firmly manife&s;ted. The&s;e throw down what their forefathers laboured to build up, and di&s;&s;olve that &s;piritual bond, which &s;hould unite us in faith and love. I ear|ne&s;tly de&s;ire they would draw near in &s;pi|rit to Chri&s;t, and to his militant church, to be a help to faithful friends. When any of you are tried with future demands on &s;uch accounts, I cannot but wi&s;h for you, as I look back to the worthies gone, that like them ye may &s;tand fa&s;t, in the freedom of the go&s;pel, without flinching, or any way evading our te&s;timony for it. I fully believe that your fidelity, in &s;uch trials, would be the means of giving you new life and &s;trength, for the zealous and upright di&s;charge of other chri&s;tian duties, and of making you both u&s;eful
<PB N="164" REF="018146_0350_0FA55F4C8CB167A8">
and honourable members, not only of civil, but al&s;o of religious &s;ociety.</P>
<P>As to that formal wor&s;hip, which is begun and carried on in the will of man, our faithful predece&s;&s;ors could have no unity with it, nor actively contribute to the &s;upport of the places or materials ap|propriated to &s;uch wor&s;hip.</P>
<P N="6">VI. On the other hand, they mo&s;t con|&s;cientiou&s;ly paid an active obedience to the laws, which enjoin the payment of cu&s;toms, duties, and exci&s;e, to the King and government; and were zealous, both by example and precept, to induce all to be careful and punctual therein, and not on any account to deal in goods &s;u&s;pect|ed to be clande&s;tinely imported, nor even to buy any of them, for their own private con&s;umption. So &s;hould we &s;till keep our&s;elves, entirely clear from this, and every other &s;ort of unrighteous gains or &s;avings.</P>
<P N="7">VII. The law of the land, &s;ets apart one day in &s;even, for religious retirement, and the wor&s;hip of God. This our fore|fathers approved of, and religiou&s;ly ob|&s;erved; tho' at the &s;ame time, they te&s;ti|fied that the Jewi&s;h &s;abbath is ended, by the coming of Chri&s;t; and that, there is no inherent holine&s;s, in any one day more than another. I have long had an ear|ne&s;t

Deny your&s;elves the liberty of walking abroad, at &s;uch time, or in &s;uch manner, as will not be of good example to the idle multitudes, who give the loo&s;e rein to licentious inclinations, on that day: but rather choo&s;e to have your families collected, for reading the holy &s;criptures, or what may make good im|pre&s;&s;ions on their minds, that when it &s;hall be &s;aid, <Q>Give an account of thy &s;teward&s;hip, for thou maye&s;t be no longer &s;teward,</Q> we then may be ready to give our accounts with joy, and receive the an&s;wer of <Q>Well done, good and faithful &s;ervant.

<P>It is apparent, that from hence the love of God in many waxeth cold. How they make light of religious duties! What a &s;lender attendance of week-day meetings for the wor&s;hip of God, as well as of tho&s;e which are held for an united care of the good of the body! So that it may now be &s;aid of many, as in &s;orrowful days formerly, <Q>The ways of Zion mourn, becau&s;e none come to her &s;olemn fea&s;ts.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lam. i. 4.</NOTE></Q> Again, what re&s;tle&s;sne&s;s in meetings, what outward indications of &s;pritual indolence, of ab&s;ent and wander|ing minds, of neglect of the awful duty of wor&s;hip, due from us to our great creator, what gazing about, or falling a&s;leep! Oh it is grievous, and tends to give &s;trangers a di&s;honourable idea concerning us, while we profe&s;s the pure &s;piritual wor|&s;hip of God, according to his own in&s;ti|tution; and while our dear Saviour hath a&s;&s;ured us, that where two or three are gathered together in his name, he is in the mid&s;t of them.

And &s;hall we not be brought to account for the&s;e things? And will not our account be heavier, in the reckoning day, than that of others, who have not been favoured in &s;o high a degree, nor &s;o much driven with, by the &s;pirit of the Lord, who declared to the old world, before its final ruin, <Q>My &s;pirit &s;hall not always &s;trive with man.</Q></P>
<P N="9">IX.

Thus were many a&s;hamed of Chri&s;t, and offended in him, for his plain and humble appearance, when in the body: but he declared that, he al&s;o would be a&s;hamed of them, or would deny them, before his father and his holy angels.</P>
<P>From the&s;e pernicious liberties, have proceeded mixt marriages, running out to

Many, by the&s;e traps and &s;nares of the common enemy, have been carried away into the wide world, and quite lo&s;t as to the dedication of their hearts and lives, to the love and fear of God: and but few have &s;tood in the gap, to prevent their thus running out: Few have joined in repairing the breaches, made by back|&s;liders, in that wall of defence, which the Lord by his power and &s;pirit, had erected about us.</P>
<P>In this general decline of the &s;ociety, there &s;eems to be great cau&s;e to fear the yet farther &s;preading of the&s;e harms, unle&s;s the Lord in mercy, turn the hearts of many, timely to him&s;elf, which we ar|dently pray for, knowing that, except the Lord build the hou&s;e, men labour but in vain: yet we mu&s;t do our duty; otherwi&s;e we &s;hall not be clear in his &s;ight: and he ordereth (now as he did formerly) line up|on line, and precept upon precept, in or|der that all may be timely warned, whe|ther they will hear or forbear!</P>
<P>I believe there are none joined in pro|fe&s;&s;ion with us, who deviate from our prin|ciple of &s;elf-denial, and plainne&s;s in habit

and &s;peech, who have not been &s;ecretly &s;hewed that it is wrong, that it is a com|pliance with the &s;pirit of the world, a re|fu&s;al of the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, a denial of him before men: but they li&s;ten to that voice, which beguiled Eve, which tells them that there is no harm in &s;uch deviations, or that they are &s;mall matters; tho' it is manife&s;t, that &s;uch &s;mall matters have opened the door gradually wider and wi|der, to the gro&s;s declen&s;ion which has over&s;pread. Tho' many are deceived and darkened by the enemy, to deem them &s;mall matters, yet they have great con&s;e|quences, as they tend to debar us of fu|ture happine&s;s, and to center us in ju&s;tly de&s;erved puni&s;hments, for di&s;obeying and di&s;regarding Chri&s;t, who leads into humi|lity and plainne&s;s, and preferring that ene|my who &s;educes into pride, and worldly conformity.</P>
<P>I often look with pity, on the victims to the vanities of the world, who fell their birthright for a me&s;s of pottage; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en de&s;iring that they may quit the pur&s;uit of &s;hadows, wi&s;ely to &s;eek, and happily po&s;&s;e&s;s the mo&s;t ine&s;timable, and enduring &s;ub&s;tance.

<P N="10">X. In regard to &s;uch as have not yet much departed from that plainne&s;s, (at lea&s;t in dre&s;s) in which they were edu|cated, &s;ome probably may not be under any &s;trong temptation, to run into the fooli&s;h fa&s;hions of a corrupt age. Yet the enemy &s;eeks to catch them in &s;ome other &s;nares: and perhaps &s;ome of the&s;e may be as ignorant, and as void of expe|rience of the divine principle we profe&s;s, as &s;ome of the more fa&s;hionable. Outward plainne&s;s, without inward humility, mercy, ju&s;tice and charity, is of very little worth. Except we follow after the&s;e virtues, ob|vious faults in temper and conduct, will appear, to di&s;cover our emptine&s;s, and to &s;erve &s;ome for an argument again&s;t plain|ne&s;s, or for a &s;ubject of ridicule; and do more harm to the cau&s;e of truth, than greater errors, in the conduct of open and profe&s;t libertines.</P>
<P>How grievou&s;ly di&s;appointing, are they who carry a right appearance, yet when tried are found to be in&s;ipid, and dead, as to the life of righteou&s;ne&s;s! Wherefore let none value them&s;elves on a plain out|&s;ide,

<P>Be not deceived: God is not mocked by fair appearances, or empty pretences: But &s;uch as every man &s;ows, he mu&s;t reap. If under the be&s;t appearance, or &s;tricte&s;t form, we &s;ow to the fle&s;h, we &s;hall only reap corruption, and the mi&s;erable fruits of hypocri&s;y, profe&s;&s;ing one thing and practi&s;ing another; when they who have &s;owed to the &s;pirit, &s;hall reap the happy fruits of their fidelity to God.</P>
<P>If we look over our &s;ociety in this na|tion, and take a view, both of them who are plain in dre&s;s, and who are otherwi&s;e, how many of both &s;orts, have their minds fa&s;t rooted in this pre&s;ent world, devoting all their talents to it, rejecting the coun|&s;el of Chri&s;t, who directs us <Q>to &s;eek fir&s;t the kingdom of God,</Q> or to live and act, under his government! Hence in &s;ome places, what poor lifele&s;s meetings! How little of the &s;acred fire of divine love burning! How little of the light of the glory of God &s;hining!

Thus have &s;ome meetings died away, and are lo&s;t; and others appear to be in a languid, &s;ick|ly condition, &s;eeming &s;carce likely to live long, except they timely apply to the great and good phy&s;ician, who is both able and willing to re&s;tore life, health, &s;oundne&s;s and vigor, to rai&s;e up and qua|lify <Q>Judges, as at the fir&s;t, and coun&s;el|lors as at the beginning.</Q> But for|merly, when in the body, in &s;ome places, he did none of his mighty works, by rea|&s;on of their unbelief: &s;o now, when his mini&s;ters vi&s;it &s;uch places, they find the go&s;pel has not a free cour&s;e; they can at be&s;t but feebly labour in &s;uch hard &s;pots.

<P>Great is the my&s;tery of iniquity, in which the &s;ubtle &s;erpent works in many, to their hurt or ruin, unawares to them, for want of their paying due regard and attention, to that grace of God, which would di&s;cover the hidden &s;nare, and pre|&s;erve from it. Hence a wrong &s;pirit

I often earne&s;tly de&s;ire, that ye who are of this kind, would do it, le&s;t ye be left to your own cour&s;es, in that broad way, which leads to de&s;truction, and <Q>the things which belong to your peace, be hid from your eyes.</Q></P>
<P N="11">XI. <Q>The Lord hath &s;hewed unto thee O man, what is good.</Q> But many have &s;uffered the good impre&s;&s;ions they have been favoured with, to be like the morning dew, which &s;oon pa&s;&s;eth away.

<P>What need have we then, to prize and pur&s;ue Chri&s;t's coun&s;el, <Q>to watch and pray,</Q> not to enter into the&s;e tempta|tions, to ab&s;tain from all appearance of evil, to avoid &s;uch company as deadly poi&s;on, as there can be no fellow&s;hip be|twixt light and darkne&s;s, or betwixt Chri&s;t

Formerly when the proud were counted happy, they who feared the Lord, &s;pake often one to ano|ther, and the Lord declared his approba|tion of the pious ardour, with which they mutually animated each other.

There are many we believe, or|derly and reputable, in their lives, who need to be more baptized into the ardent love of God, and dedication of heart to his cau&s;e, that they may not be like &s;loth|ful &s;ervants, at ea&s;e in Zion, and indulg|ing them&s;elves, in&s;tead of &s;erving the Lord. The harve&s;t is great, and needs more labourers, to fill up the vacant pla|ces of many removed from works to re|wards. What want of mini&s;ters, elders, of &s;uch whom the Holy Gho&s;t hath made over&s;eers, taking heed to them&s;elves, and to the flock, of helpers of one another in animating vi&s;its, both to families and

<P>A few yet are mercifully pre&s;erved, who for Zion's &s;ake cannot be at ea&s;e, but thro' all di&s;couragements hold on their way, knowing they &s;erve a good ma&s;ter, and re&s;olving thro' his grace, never to de&s;ert his &s;ervice, but to keep their places under his direction, and to hold fa&s;t the ble&s;&s;ed truth, in the love of it, to the end of their lives.

<P N="15">XV. When our Lord told his di&s;ciples, that one of them &s;hould betray him, the re&s;t heard it with concern, and enquired, <HI>Is it I?</HI> Many have contributed to the great declen&s;ion, and each of us &s;hould

We mu&s;t give up all our idols; el&s;e we are undone. Our own wills mu&s;t be &s;ubjected to the will of God. All our own wi&s;dom mu&s;t be laid at his feet. We mu&s;t deny our&s;elves, take up our cro&s;s daily, and follow him. There are no other terms on which life everla&s;ting is to be had. Our Lord informs us, that they who expect to gain it, by climbing up any other way, will be treated as thieves and robbers. Oh then, my dear friends, in every part of Ireland, I earne&s;tly de&s;ire that ye may buy the truth, whatever it co&s;t you, and &s;ell it not. Look upon all things be&s;ide, but as dro&s;s or dung, in compari&s;on of it. Let us hold fa&s;t the one thing needful, whatever el&s;e leave us or be taken from us.

O ye parents, who have many children, and not much of the world for them, don't be over anxious on that ac|count, or make it an excu&s;e, for non-at|tendance of religious duties. Con&s;ider that it may be wi&s;ely &s;o ordered, as the means of their pre&s;ervation; and if they follow Chri&s;t, it may prove of great ad|vantage to them, beyond what ye and they are aware of. A little &s;atisfies a hum|ble mind, as we brought nothing into the world, and can carry nothing out. They who obtain the favour of God, will nei|ther want any thing needful, nor covet any thing &s;uperfluous, but having food and raiment, therewith be content. Where|fore be anxious for them, only on this account, that they may lay hold on eter|nal life, and keep their hold of that; then they will be truly happy, but not without it, if they had ever &s;o much in the world. They are indeed ju&s;tly to be e&s;teemed, who having more, are thereby the more humbled, and more abounding in u&s;eful &s;ervices and good works.</P>

even true honour with God, is hu|mility; but pride goes before de&s;truction. Ye need not envy any one, however great in the world, if ye have the Lord on your &s;ide. United with your dear parents, in walking humbly with him, ye will have the enlarged view of your happy portion. Your &s;ervent gratitude, obedience, vigi|lance and firmne&s;s, will be crowned with the endearing pledges and encouraging foreta&s;tes, of endle&s;s bli&s;s. So will ye be well &s;atisfied with your lots in every condition, and find that godline&s;s coupled with di|vine contentment is the greate&s;t, and infi|nitely the mo&s;t valuable gain, being fitted by your ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer for life, death, judgment, and for that eternal joy, which is un&s;peakable and full of glory.</P>
<P>So will ye be alive to God, and of that number whom he pronounces ble&s;&s;ed, who hanger and thir&s;t after righteou&s;ne&s;s. So will ye carefully watch again&s;t every thing that is wrong, both in your&s;elves and others, and endeavour to &s;top it in its fir&s;t beginning: ye will love that which is good, and employ all your talents, with divine help, to promote it both by exam|ple and brotherly coun&s;el.</P>
<P>Then would meetings both for wor&s;hip and di&s;cipline be well attended; for com|ing to them under the preparation of

We &s;hould hereby be edified and built up together in the mo&s;t holy faith, and con|cerned to live in reverent love and &s;ub|jection to him out of meetings, faithfully maintaining our te&s;timony for Chri&s;t, our holy head in all its branches.</P>
<P>So &s;hould we be again, as formerly, a people of one heart and mind, baptized by one &s;pirit into one body: All the dark|ne&s;s of ignorance and inexperience, all the coldne&s;s of the worldly or carnal mind would be removed; and Zion's light would yet again go forth with brightne&s;s, and the &s;alvation of God be felt among&s;t us, as a lamp that burneth.</P>
<P>With &s;trong de&s;ires on the behalf of all, who, in this nation, join in the profe&s;|&s;ion of the ble&s;&s;ed truth, that they may thus experience the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, and be partakers of its &s;aving efficacy and la&s;ting peace, I remain your affectionate and well-wi&s;hing friend.</P>
