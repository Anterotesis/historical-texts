<P><HI>Who, after having exchanged their full powers, and patiently and carefully di&s;cu&s;&s;ed their re&s;pective intere&s;ts, have agreed to the following articles:</HI></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="038726_0003_1012C1B180224570"><HI>ARTICLE</HI> I. There &s;hall be a firm, inviolable and uni|ver&s;al peace, and true and &s;incere friend&s;hip, between the French Republic and the United States of America, as well between their countries, territories, cities and places, as between their citizens and inhabitants, without ex|ception of per&s;ons or places.</P>
<P N="2">II. The Mini&s;ters Plenipotentiary of the two parties, not being empowered at pre&s;ent to agree relative to the treaty of alliance of the 6th of February, 1778, to the treaty of friend&s;hip and commerce of the &s;ame date, and to the convention of the 14th of November, nor to the indemnities mutually due and claimed, the parties &s;hall further negotiate upon the&s;e points at a convenient time; and until they &s;hall be agreed upon the&s;e points, the &s;aid treaties and convention &s;hall have no effect, and the rela|tions of the two nations &s;hall be regulated as follows:</P>
<P N="3">III. The &s;hips belonging to the State taken on either &s;ide, or which may be taken before the exchange of ratifications, &s;hall be given up.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The properties captured and not yet definitively condemned, or which may be captured before the ex|change of ratifications, except contraband merchandi&s;e de&s;tined for an enemy's port, &s;hall be mutually re&s;tored upon the following proofs of property, viz.</P>
<P>On the one part, and on the other, the proofs of pro|perty relative to merchant ve&s;&s;els, armed or unarmed, &s;hall be a pa&s;&s;port in the following form:</P>
<Q><P>To all tho&s;e to whom the&s;e pre&s;ents &s;hall come, be it known, that power and permi&s;&s;ion has been given to &mdash;, Ma&s;ter or Com|mander of the ve&s;&s;el called the &mdash;, of the city of &mdash;, of the bur|den of &mdash; tons, or thereabouts, now lying in the port or harbour of &mdash;, and de&s;tined for &mdash;, laden with &mdash;, that after his &s;hip has been vi&s;ited, and before his departure, he &s;hall make oath, before officers authori&s;ed for that purpo&s;e, that the &s;aid &s;hip belongs to

one or more &s;ubjects of &mdash;, the execution of which form &s;hall be annexed to the&s;e pre&s;ents, in order that he may ob&s;erve and cau&s;e to be ob&s;erved by his crew the maritime ordinances and re|gulations, and give in a li&s;t &s;igned and atte&s;ted, containing the names and &s;urnames, places of birth and abode, of the per&s;ons compo&s;ing the crew of his &s;hip, and of all on board her, whom he &s;hall not receive on board without the knowledge and per|mi&s;&s;ion of the officers authori&s;ed for that purpo&s;e; and in every port and harbour where he &s;hall enter with his &s;hip, he &s;hall &s;hew the pre&s;ent permi&s;&s;ion to the proper officers, and make to them a faithful report of all that has pa&s;&s;ed during his voyage, and carry the colours, arms and flags of the French Republic or the United States, during his &s;aid voyage: In te&s;timony of which we have &s;igned the&s;e pre&s;ents, cau&s;ed them to be counter&s;igned by &mdash;, and thereunto put the &s;eal of our arms.</P>
<P>"Given at &mdash;, in the year of our Lord &mdash;.</P></Q>
<P>And this pa&s;&s;port &s;hall be &s;ufficient without any other document, notwith&s;tanding any regulation to the contrary.</P>
<P>It &s;hall not be nece&s;&s;ary to renew or revoke this pa&s;&s;port, whatever number of voyages the &s;aid &s;hip &s;hall have made, unle&s;s they &s;hall not have returned home within the &s;pace of a year.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the cargo, the proofs &s;hall be certifi|cates, containing an account what place the &s;hip has left, and where it is going to, &s;o that prohibited and contra|band merchandi&s;e may be di&s;tingui&s;hed by certificates, which certificates &s;hall have been made by the officers of the place from whence the &s;hip &s;hall have &s;et out, agree|able to the accu&s;tomed forms of the country. And if the&s;e pa&s;&s;ports or certificates, or both, &s;hall have been de&s;troyed by accident, or taken away by force, the want of them &s;hall be &s;upplied by every other proof of property admi&s;&s;ible according to the general u&s;age of nations.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="038726_0005_1012C1B498DC8C38">For other &s;hips be&s;ides merchant &s;hips, the proof &s;hall be the commi&s;&s;ions they bear. This article &s;hall take effect from the date of the &s;ignature of the pre&s;ent Con|vention; and if by the date of the &s;aid &s;ignature proper|ty &s;hall have been condemned contrary to the &s;pirit of the &s;aid Convention, and previous to the knowledge of this &s;tipulation, the property &s;o condemned &s;hall be re|&s;tored or paid for.</P>
<P N="5">V. The debts contracted by either of the two nations towards the individuals of each &s;hall be acquitted, or the payment &s;hall be in cour&s;e, as if there had been no mi&s;|under&s;tanding between the two &s;tates; but this clau&s;e &s;hall not extend to indemnities, claimed for captures or condemnations.</P>
<P N="6">VI. The trade between the two parties &s;hall be free; the &s;hips of the two nations, and their privateers, as well as their prizes, &s;hall be treated in their re&s;pective ports as tho&s;e of the mo&s;t favoured nation; and in general the two parties &s;hall enjoy in each other's ports, with re&s;pect to commerce and navigation, the &s;ame privileges as the mo&s;t favoured nations.</P>
<P N="7">VII. The citizens and inhabitants of the United States may di&s;po&s;e by will, donation, or otherwi&s;e, of their goods, moveable and immoveable property, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in the European territory of the French Republic; and the citizens of the French Republic &s;hall have the &s;ame pow|er with regard to the goods, moveable and immoveable property, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in the territory of the United States, in favour of &s;uch per&s;ons as they &s;hall think proper.&mdash; The citizens and inhabitants of one of the two States, who &s;hall be heirs of the goods, moveable or immoveable pro|perty &s;ituate in the other, may &s;ucceed <HI>ab inte&s;tat,</HI> without there being any nece&s;&s;ity for letters of neutrality, and without the effect of this &s;tipulation being conte&s;ted or
<PB N="6" REF="038726_0006_1012C1B624001850">
impeached under any pretence whatever; and the &s;aid heirs, whether by private right, or <HI>ab inte&s;tat,</HI> &s;hall be ex|empt from all right whatever of any one in either of the two nations. It is agreed, that this article &s;hall not de|rogate in any manner from the laws which are now in force, in either of the two nations, or which may be pro|mulgated hereafter again&s;t emigration; and al&s;o, that in ca&s;e the laws of either of the two &s;tates &s;hall limit to foreigners the exerci&s;e of the right of immoveable pro|perty, &s;uch immoveable property may be &s;old, or other|wi&s;e di&s;po&s;ed of, in favour of the inhabitants or citizens of the country where they &s;hall be &s;ituate; and it &s;hall be open to the other nation to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;imilar laws.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. To favour the commerce of both nations, it is agreed, that if war (which God forbid) &s;hould break out between the two nations, the merchants and other citi|zens, or re&s;pective inhabitants, &s;hall be allowed on both &s;ides &s;ix months after the declaration of war; during which period they &s;hall have time to retire, with their effects and moveables, which they may carry away, or &s;ell, as they &s;hall think proper, without the lea&s;t impediment; their effects, and &s;till le&s;s their per&s;ons, &s;hall not, during the period of &s;ix months, be &s;eized. On the contrary, they &s;hall have pa&s;&s;ports, which &s;hall be valid for the time nece&s;&s;ary to enable them to return home, and tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ports &s;hall be given for them&s;elves, as well as for their &s;hips and effects which they &s;hall de&s;ire to take or &s;end away. The&s;e pa&s;&s;ports &s;hall &s;erve as protections again&s;t all in&s;ults and all captures on the part of privateers, as well with regard to them&s;elves as their effects; and if within the term above mentioned there &s;hall have been committed by one of the parties, its citizens, or inhabi|tants, any wrong towards their per&s;ons or their property, they &s;hall have complete &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P N="9"><PB N="7" REF="038726_0007_1012C1B929AD2C98">IX. The debts due by individuals of one of the two nations to the individuals of the other &s;hall not, in ca&s;e of war or national di&s;pute, be &s;eque&s;tered or confi&s;cated, no more than the claims or funds which &s;hall be found in the public funds, or in the public or private banks.</P>
<P N="10">X. The two contracting parties may nominate for the protection of trade Commercial Agents, who &s;hall re&s;ide in France and the United States. Each of the parties may accept &s;uch place as it &s;hall judge proper, where the re&s;idence &s;hall be fixed. Before any agent can exer|ci&s;e his functions, he mu&s;t be accepted according to the received forms of the party to which he is &s;ent, and when he &s;hall be received and provided with his exequatur, he &s;hall enjoy the rights and prerogatives which are enjoyed by &s;imilar agents of the mo&s;t favoured nations.</P>
<P N="11">XI. The citizens of the French Republic &s;hall not pay, in any ports, harbours, roads, countries, i&s;lands, ci|ties and places of the United States, other or greater du|ties or impo&s;ts, of what nature &s;oever they may be, and whatever names they may have, than tho&s;e which the mo&s;t &s;avoured nations are, or &s;hall be bound to pay; and they &s;hall enjoy all rights, liberties, privileges, im|munities, and exemptions, relating to trade, navigation, and commerce, whether in pa&s;&s;ing from one part of the &s;aid &s;tates to another, or whether in going there or re|turning from &s;ome part to any part of the world, that the &s;aid nations enjoy, or &s;hall enjoy; and reciprocally the citizens of the United States &s;hall enjoy in the territory of the French Republic, in Europe, the &s;ame privileges, and immunities, as well for their goods as their per&s;ons, as for what concerns trade, navigation, and commerce.</P>
<P N="12">XII. The citizens of the two nations may conduct their ve&s;&s;els and their merchandi&s;es (always excepting &s;uch as are contraband) from any port to another belonging to
<PB N="8" REF="038726_0008_1012C1C0687400B8">
the enemy of the other nation. They may navigate and commerce with full liberty and &s;ecurity, with their &s;hips and merchandi&s;es, in the countries, ports, and places of the enemies of the two parties, or of the one or the other party, without ob&s;tacles or interruption, and not only pa&s;s directly from the places and ports of the enemy a|bovementioned to neutral ports and places, but from every place belonging to an enemy, whether it be or be not &s;ubject to the &s;ame juri&s;diction, unle&s;s tho&s;e places or ports &s;hall be really blockaded, be&s;ieged, or inve&s;ted.</P>
<P>And in ca&s;e, as it often happens, when ve&s;&s;els &s;hall be &s;ailing for places or ports belonging to an enemy, igno|rant that they are blockaded, be&s;ieged, or inve&s;ted, it is agreed that every &s;hip which &s;hall be found under &s;uch a predicament &s;hall be turned from that place or port without any part of its cargo being retained or confi&s;cat|ed (unle&s;s it &s;hall be contraband, or it &s;hall be proved that the &s;aid &s;hip, after having been informed of the blockade or inve&s;titure, attempted to enter the &s;ame port) but it &s;hall be allowed to go to any other port or place it &s;hall think proper. No &s;hip of either nation, entered in a port or place before it &s;hall have been really blockaded, be&s;ieged, or inve&s;ted by the other, &s;hall be prevented from going out with its cargo: If it &s;hall be there when the &s;aid place &s;hall &s;urrender, the &s;hip and cargo &s;hall not be confi&s;cated, but &s;ent away to the pro|prietors.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. To regulate what &s;hall be under&s;tood by con|traband warlike &s;tores, under this denomination &s;hall be compri&s;ed powder, &s;altpetre, petards, matches, balls, bullets, bombs, grenades, carca&s;&s;es, pikes, halberts, &s;words, belts, pi&s;tols, &s;cabbards, &s;addles, harne&s;s, cannon, mor|tars, with their carriages, and generally all arms and ammunitions of war and uten&s;ils for the u&s;e of troops.
<PB N="9" REF="038726_0009_1012C1C367942420">
All the above articles, whenever they &s;hall be de&s;tined for an enemy's port, are declared contraband, and ju&s;tly &s;ubject to confi&s;cation: but the &s;hip in which they &s;hall be laden, as well as the re&s;t of the cargo, &s;hall be con|&s;idered as free, and &s;hall in no manner be vitiated by the contraband merchandi&s;e, whether they belong to the &s;ame or different proprietors.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. It is &s;tipulated by the pre&s;ent treaty, that the free &s;hips &s;hall equally a&s;&s;ure the liberty of merchandi&s;e, and that all things &s;hall be deemed free, which are found on board &s;hips belonging to the citizens of one of the contracting parties, even though the &s;ame, or part of it, &s;hall belong to the enemies of one of the two; provided, neverthele&s;s, that contraband goods are always excepted. It is likewi&s;e agreed, that this &s;ame liberty &s;hall extend to per&s;ons who may be on board the free &s;hip, though they &s;hould be enemies of one of the two contracting parties, and they &s;hall not be taken from the &s;aid free &s;hips, un|le&s;s they are in a military capacity&punc; and actually in the &s;ervice of the enemy.</P>
<P N="15">XV. It is on the contrary agreed, that all property which &s;hall be put, by the re&s;pective citizens, on board &s;hips belonging to an enemy of either party, or their &s;ubjects, &s;hall be confi&s;cated without di&s;tinction of mer|chandi&s;e, prohibited or not prohibited, &s;o and in like man|ner as if it belonged to an enemy, with the exception al|ways of property and effects which &s;hall have been put on board the &s;aid &s;hips before the declaration of war, or even after the &s;aid declaration, if at the time of l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ding the party were ignorant of it; &s;o that the merchandi&s;es of citizens of the two parties, whether they be in the number of contraband or not, which as has been already &s;aid, &s;hall have been put on board a &s;hip belonging of an enemy before the war, or even after the &s;aid declaration
<PB N="10" REF="038726_0010_1012C1C4F2E09110">
of war, in ignorance of it, &s;hall not be in any manner &s;ubject to confi&s;cation, but &s;hall be faithfully and truly given up without delay to the owners claiming them, provided neverthele&s;s that they &s;hall not be permitted to carry into the enemies ports merchandi&s;e which &s;hall be contraband. The two contracting powers agree, that af|ter a term of two months has pa&s;&s;ed from the declaration, their re&s;pective citizens, in whatever part of the world they may be, &s;hall not be at liberty to plead the ignorance mentioned in this article.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. Merchant ve&s;&s;els belonging to citizens of either of the contracting powers, when they &s;hall have a mind to pa&s;s to the port of an enemy of the one or the other, and that their voyage as well as the nature of their cargo, &s;hall afford ju&s;t cau&s;e of &s;u&s;picion, the &s;aid &s;hip &s;hall be obliged to exhibit at high &s;ea, as well as in ports and roads, not only their pa&s;&s;ports, but further their certifi|cates, proving that the&s;e goods are not of the cla&s;s of contraband &s;pecified in the 13th article of the pre&s;ent convention.</P>
<P N="17">XVII. And in order to prevent captures on frivolous &s;u&s;picions, and the damage thus re&s;ulting, it is agreed, that when one of the two powers &s;hall be at war, and the other neutral, the ve&s;&s;els of the neutral party &s;hall be provided with pa&s;&s;port &s;imilar to tho&s;e &s;pecified in the 4th article, &s;o that it may thence appear that the parties belongs to a neutral party. The&s;e pa&s;&s;ports &s;hall be va|lid for any number of voyages whatever; but they &s;hall be renewed every year, if the &s;hip returns home within the &s;pace of a year. If the&s;e &s;hips are laden, they &s;hall be provided not only with the pa&s;&s;ports above-mentioned, but al&s;o with certificates of the de&s;cription of tho&s;e mentioned in the &s;ame article, &s;o that it may be known whether they have on board contraband goods. No other paper &s;hall be
<PB N="11" REF="038726_0011_1012C1C7EC65D070">
required, all u&s;ages and regulations to the contrary not|with&s;tanding; and if it &s;hould appear from the&s;e certi|ficates that there is not contraband merchandi&s;e on board, the &s;aid &s;hips &s;hall be left to pur&s;ue their de&s;tina|tion. If, on the contrary, it &s;hould appear from the&s;e certificates that the &s;aid &s;hips have contraband merchan|di&s;e on board, and the Commander offers to deliver them up, the offer &s;hall be accepted, and the &s;hip left at liberty to pro&s;ecute her voyage, unle&s;s the quantity of contra|band goods &s;hould be too great to admit of taking on board the &s;hip of war or crui&s;er; in this ca&s;e the &s;hip &s;hall be carried into port for the purpo&s;e of there deliver|ing the &s;aid goods.</P>
<P>Should a &s;hip be found without the pa&s;&s;ports or the cer|tificates above required, the bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hall be examined by competent judges or tribunals; and if it &s;hould appear from other documents or proofs, admi&s;&s;ible by the law of nations, that the &s;hip belongs to citizens of the neutral power, it &s;hall not be condemned, and it &s;hall be &s;et at liberty with its cargo, contraband goods excepted, and &s;hall have leave to pro&s;ecute its voyage.</P>
<P>Should the Captain named in the pa&s;&s;port, happen to die or be removed, and another &s;hall have been appoint|ed in his place, the &s;hip and cargo &s;hall be neverthele&s;s &s;ecure, and the pa&s;&s;port &s;hall remain in full force.</P>
<P N="18">XVIII. If the ve&s;&s;els belonging to citizens of the one nation or the other &s;hall be met along the coa&s;t, or on the high &s;eas, by any &s;hip of war or cruizer belonging to the other, to prevent all di&s;order, the &s;aid &s;hips or crui&s;ers &s;hall keep beyond the reach of cannon &s;hot, and &s;hall &s;end their boat on board the merchant ve&s;&s;el &s;o met with. They &s;hall not be allowed to &s;end on board more than two or three men to demand from the ma&s;ter or Captain of the &s;hip the exhibition of his pa&s;&s;port concerning the
<PB N="12" REF="038726_0012_1012C1CCAC1A0618">
property of &s;aid &s;hip, executed agreeable to the form pre&s;cribed in the 4th article, as al&s;o the certificates above mentioned relative to the cargo. It is expre&s;sly agreed that the neutral Captain &s;hall not be obliged to go on board the vi&s;iting &s;hip for the purpo&s;e of there &s;hewing the papers demanded, or for any other informa|tion whatever.</P>
<P N="19">XIX. It is expre&s;sly agreed by the parties, that the above &s;tipulations relative to the conduct to be ob&s;erv|ed at &s;ea by the crui&s;ers of the belligerent party towards the ve&s;&s;els of the neutral party &s;hall apply only to &s;hips &s;ailing without convoy; and in ca&s;e, when the &s;aid &s;hips &s;hall be convoyed, the intention of the parties being to ob|&s;erve all the re&s;pect due to the protection of the flag hoi&s;t|ed on board &s;hips of the &s;tate, no vi&s;it &s;hall be made. But the verbal declaration of the Commander of the e&s;cort, that the &s;hips under his convoy belong to the nation who&s;e flag he carries, and that they have not any thing contraband on board, &s;hall be taken by the re&s;pective crui&s;ers as amply &s;ufficient. The two parties bind them|&s;elves reciprocally not to admit under protection of their convoys any ve&s;&s;els carrying contraband merchandi&s;e de&s;tined for an enemy.</P>
<P N="20">XX. In ca&s;e when the &s;hips &s;hall be taken or &s;topt, under alledged grounds of their carrying any contra|band articles to the enemy, the captor &s;hall give a receipt of the &s;hip's papers which he &s;hall detain, which receipt &s;hall be &s;ubjoined to a declaratory li&s;t of the &s;aid papers. He &s;hall not be permitted to force open the hatches, coffers, che&s;ts, drawers, bales, &amp;c. found on board &s;hips, nor to carry off the &s;malle&s;t article of the effects, before the cargo has been di&s;embarked in pre&s;ence of the officers compe|tent to make an inventory of the &s;aid effects. They cannot in any manner be &s;old, exchanged, or alienated,
<PB N="13" REF="038726_0013_1012C1CFAC3D39D0">
unle&s;s, after a legal proce&s;s, the competent judge or judg|es have pa&s;&s;ed upon the &s;aid effects a &s;entence of confi&s;ca|tion (excepting always the &s;hip and the other objects that it contains.)</P>
<P N="21">XXI. In order that the ve&s;&s;el and the cargo may be watched with care, and in order to prevent mi&s;takes, it is decreed that the ma&s;ter, captain or &s;upercargo of the captured &s;hip cannot be taken from on board, either while the &s;hip is at &s;ea, after being taken, during the proceed|ings again&s;t it, its cargo, or any thing relative to it.</P>
<P>In ca&s;e of the &s;hip belonging to either party being taken, &s;eized, and retained for judgment, its officers, pa&s;|&s;engers and crews &s;hall be treated with humanity; they cannot be impri&s;oned nor robbed of their clothes or pocket money, not exceeding for the captain, &s;upercargo, and &s;econd, five hundred dollars each, and for the &s;ailors and pa&s;&s;engers, one hundred dollars each.</P>
<P N="22">XXII. It is moreover agreed on, that in every ca&s;e the tribunals appointed for prize cau&s;es in the countries whith|er the prizes &s;hall be taken, &s;hall alone be competent to try them; and every judgment which the tribunal of eith|er party pronounces again&s;t a &s;hip, or merchandi&s;e, or property reclaimed by the citizens of the other party, the &s;entence or decree &s;hall make mention of the rea&s;ons or motives which have determined this judgment, of which an authentic copy, as well as of all the proceed|ings relative to it, &s;hall, on their requi&s;ition, be deliver|ed without delay to the captain or agent of the &s;aid &s;hip, after paying the expences.</P>
<P N="23">XXIII. And finally, in order more effectually to pro|vide for the re&s;pective &s;ecurity of the citizens of the two contracting parties, and to prevent the injuries to be fear|ed from &s;hips of war or privateers of either party, all the commanders of &s;hips of war or privateers, and all the
<PB N="14" REF="038726_0014_1012C1D137D5D2C0">
citizens of both parties, &s;hall refrain from all violence again&s;t one another, and from every per&s;onal in&s;ult. If they act in a contrary manner they &s;hall be puni&s;hed, and bound over in their per&s;ons and properties to give &s;atis|faction and reparation for the damage, with intere&s;t, of whatever kind the &s;aid damage may be.</P>
<P>To this effect all the captains of privateers, before receiv|ing their commi&s;&s;ions, &s;hall become bound before a com|petent judge, to give &s;ecurity by two re&s;pon&s;ible cautions at lea&s;t, who &s;hall have no intere&s;t in the &s;aid privateer, and whom each, as well as the captain, &s;hall engage in|dividually for the &s;um of 7,000 dollars, or 36,820 francs, if the &s;aid ve&s;&s;els carry more than 150 &s;ailors or &s;oldiers, for the &s;um of 15,000 dollars, or 73,670 francs, which &s;hall &s;erve to repair the damage that the &s;aid privateers, their officers, or crews, or any of them, &s;hall have com|mitted during their crui&s;e contrary to the di&s;po&s;itions of the pre&s;ent convention, or to the laws and in&s;tructions which ought to be the rule of their conduct; be&s;ides this, the &s;aid commi&s;&s;ion &s;hall be revoked and annulled in every ca&s;e where an aggre&s;&s;ion has been committed.</P>
<P N="24">XXIV. When the &s;hips of war of the two contracting parties, or tho&s;e which their citizens &s;hall have armed, &s;hall be admitted with their prizes into the ports of either of the two parties, the &s;aid public or private ve&s;&s;els, as well as their prizes, &s;hall not be obliged to pay any duties, either to the officers of the place, or to the judges, or to any others. The &s;aid prizes entering in the harbours or ports of one of the two parties, &s;hall not be arre&s;ted or &s;eized, and the officers of the place &s;hall not take cogni|zance of the validity of the &s;aid prizes, which are to be &s;uffered to go out, and be conducted with full freedom and liberty to their ports, by the commi&s;&s;ions which the captains of the &s;aid ve&s;&s;els &s;hall be obliged to &s;hew. It is
<PB N="15" REF="038726_0015_1012C1D5AFE14F18">
always under&s;tood, that the &s;tipulations of this article &s;hall not extend beyond the privileges of the mo&s;t favoured nations.</P>
<P N="25">XXV. All foreign privateers having commi&s;&s;ions from a State or Prince at war with one or other nation cannot arm their ve&s;&s;els in the ports of either nation, or di&s;po&s;e of their prizes there, or in any manner exchange them.&mdash; They &s;hall not be allowed to buy provi&s;ions further than the nece&s;&s;ary quantity to gain the neare&s;t port of the State or Prince from whom they &s;hall have received their com|mi&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P N="26">XXVI. It is further agreed that neither of the two con|tracting parties &s;hall receive pirates in its ports, roads, or cities, and &s;hall not permit any of its inhabitants to re|ceive, protect, &s;upport or conceal them in any manner, but &s;hall deliver up to due puni&s;hment &s;uch of its inhabitants as &s;hall be guilty of the like acts or crimes: the &s;hips of tho&s;e pirates, as well as their effects and merchandize, &s;hall be &s;eized wherever they &s;hall be di&s;covered, and re&s;tored to their proprietors, agents or factors, duly authorized by them, after having proved their right before judges com|petent to decide re&s;pecting the property.</P>
<P>If the &s;aid effects have pa&s;&s;ed by &s;ale into other hands, and the purcha&s;ers were or might be informed, or have &s;u&s;pected, that the &s;aid effects were carried away by pirates, they &s;hall be equally re&s;tored.</P>
<P N="27">XXVII. Neither of the two nations &s;hall interfere in the fi&s;heries of the other upon its coa&s;ts, nor di&s;turb it in the exerci&s;e of the rights which it now has, or may acquire, on the coa&s;ts of Newfoundland, in the Gulf of St. Laurence, or el&s;ewhere on the coa&s;t of America, or the north of the United States; but the whale and &s;eal fi&s;hery &s;hall be free for the two nations in all parts of the world.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="038726_0016_1012C1D73B3D6F90">The Convention &s;hall be ratified on both &s;ide<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in due form, and the ratifications &s;hall be exchanged in the &s;pace of &s;ix months, or &s;ooner if it be po&s;&s;ible. In faith whereof the re&s;pective Plenipotentiaries have &s;igned the above articles as well in the French as in the Engli&s;h language, and have placed their &s;eals, declaring neverthele&s;s that the &s;ignature in two languages &s;hall not be cited as an example, and &s;hall not prejudice either of the two parties.</P>
