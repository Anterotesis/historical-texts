<OPENER><SALUTE>BRETHREN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have travel'd a great Way to &s;ee you, and to hold &s;ome Di&s;|cour&s;e with you. The People of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> have always been Friends to the <HI>Five Nations:</HI> They have punctually kept all their former Treaties with you. They expect, that you do not forget them, and therefore I am come to brighten the Chain between us. You &s;ent me Word, that you de&s;ired to &s;ee me, and I have ob|tained Leave of my Brother, the Governor of <HI>New-York,</HI> to renew at this Place our former Treaties with you; and I am glad he is pre&s;ent with us, to hear and ob&s;erve all that is &s;poken.</P>
<P>Some of your ancient Men can yet remember the fir&s;t Settlement of the Province of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> by <HI>William Penn:</HI> He was a good Man, and had a great Affection for all the <HI>Indians:</HI> He entred into Leagues of Friend&s;hip with them, and treated them as his Brethren; and he gave it in Charge to his Governors, whom he left in his Place, and to all his People, that they &s;hould continue to do the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Divers Great Men from the <HI>Five Nations</HI> have, on &s;everal Occa&s;ions, vi&s;ited us at <HI>Philadelphia</HI> and <HI>Cone&s;togoe.</HI> We were always glad to &s;ee them, and treated them kindly like Brethren. They made firm Leagues of Friend&s;hip with us, and frequently renew'd and &s;trengthned them. We became as one People, and hope always to continue &s;o; and as often as the <HI>Five Nations</HI> renew'd their Leagues with our great and good Friends the Governors of <HI>New-York,</HI> it &s;till united them more nearly to us, as being Subjects of one and the &s;ame Great KING.</P>
<P>La&s;t Summer the wi&s;e and good Man <HI>Ge&s;aont,</HI> with &s;ome others of your People, came, in the Name of all the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> to vi&s;it us at <HI>Cone&s;togoe</HI>&punc; We received them with Joy, and opened our Hearts to each other. He rejoyced to &s;ee us and our <HI>Indians</HI> live in &s;o much Love together. We then brightned the Chain, that it might be clear, &s;trong and la&s;ting as the Sun and Stars. But when we heard that <HI>Ge&s;aont</HI> died in <HI>Virginia,</HI> we were very &s;orry; yet I hope the <HI>Five Nations</HI> received my Words of Love and Friend&s;hip to their <HI>Sachims,</HI> and to all their People, with the Golden Medal and the Pre&s;ents then delivered.</P>
<P>It was then &s;tipulated and agreed between us, That we &s;hould all be as one People; That the <HI>Five Nations</HI> &s;hould not do an Injury to any
<PB N="4" REF="002343_0005_0FDBCC9AAF44EFD8">
of us more than to them&s;elves; and that we &s;hould not do an Injury to any of the <HI>Five Nations</HI> more than to our own People: Or, if any Per&s;on did &s;uch Injury, they &s;hould be puni&s;hed for it in the &s;ame Manner as if done to an <HI>Engli&s;hman.</HI></P>
<P>Since that Time a very unhappy Accident has fallen out, which gave us great Grief: La&s;t Winter we heard, that one of the <HI>Five Na|tions</HI> had lo&s;t his Life by Means of &s;ome of our People.</P>
<P>The very next Day after the News came to me at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> I &s;ent two of my Council to <HI>Cone&s;togoe,</HI> to enquire into the Matter and bring me the Truth. They &s;ound that the Quarrel aro&s;e about <HI>Rum,</HI> between a Brother of the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> who hunted near <HI>Potomack,</HI> and two of our Traders.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indian</HI> was angry, and went ha&s;tily and took his Gun to kill the <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI>; they, in Defence of them&s;elves, &s;eized the <HI>Indian,</HI> and in &s;truggling gave him &s;ome Blows, and left him. We heard, that our <HI>Indian</HI> Friend and Brother died the next Day.</P>
<P>The Men who did this were brought to <HI>Philadelphia</HI> and put in Pri&s;on; and they will be tried according to our Laws, in the &s;ame Manner as if they had kill'd an <HI>Engli&s;hman.</HI> And to prevent &s;uch Mi&s;chief for the Future, we have made a &s;evere Law again&s;t &s;elling <HI>Rum</HI> to the <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>Though this Misfortune gave us great Grief, yet we are per&s;waded that the Chief <HI>Sachims</HI> of the <HI>Five Nations</HI> are &s;o wi&s;e as to know, that &s;uch Accidents may happen without any ill De&s;ign among&s;t the neare&s;t Brethren. And by this they will &s;ee, how &s;trictly we keep our Leagues and Treaties, in puni&s;hing tho&s;e who &s;hall dare to offend and injure them, or any of their People.</P>
<P>I made ha&s;te to &s;end a Me&s;&s;age to the <HI>Five Nations</HI> by <HI>Satcheecho</HI> to expre&s;s our Sorrow, and I received their kind An&s;wer by the Return of the &s;ame Me&s;&s;enger. You received our Me&s;&s;age like true Brethren, de&s;iring us, to wipe away our Tears, and invited me to come and &s;ee you. Immediately I &s;ent <HI>Satcheecho</HI> back with this An&s;wer, <HI>That I would meet you at</HI> Albany, <HI>with my good Friends the Governors of</HI> New|York <HI>and</HI> Virginia; and I &s;ent &s;ome Tokens to your <HI>Sachims,</HI> which I hope they received, with a Mourning Gold Ring off my own Finger to <HI>Sakaunkauta.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Satcheecho</HI> returned &s;peedily, and &s;aid, <HI>You would be glad to &s;ee me at</HI> Albany; He al&s;o told me, You de&s;ired <HI>John Cartlidge</HI> might be relea&s;ed out of Pri&s;on, and the Injury done to your Kin&s;man might be forgot. But <HI>Satcheecho</HI> brought no Belt, nor any other Token to confirm his Words; and therefore I have brought him along with me, that you may know and tell me if he &s;poke Truth.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>You &s;ee I am come here with Four of my Council to vi&s;it you. I have left my Family and People, and have travel'd a great Way to take you by the Hand, to join Hearts, and to rejoyce in &s;eeing each other's Faces: For all Clouds and Darkne&s;s mu&s;t be done away, that the Flame of Love and Af<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ction may burn clear in our Brea&s;ts.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="002343_0006_0FDBCC9E748DD3B0">
I have brought the&s;e Goods with me to bind my Words, <HI>viz. Five Pieces</HI> of <HI>Strouds</HI> for Cloathing, <HI>Five Casks of Powder</HI> and <HI>Five Hundred Weight of Lead</HI> to encourage your Hunting, that you may grow rich and &s;trong. And I de&s;ire you may receive them as a Pledge of our firm Re&s;olutions to live in Perpetual Peace, and under the &s;tronge&s;t Ties of Friend&s;hip with the <HI>Five Nations</HI>; that you will ever remember us as your Brethren, and not &s;uffer your young Men, when they travel, to hurt any of our Inhabitants, no more than they would their own, or to kill their Cattle and Stock: And that this Vi&s;it, and the Cove|nant-Chain which is hereby brightned, may be recorded in everla&s;ting Remembrance, to be &s;ent down to your and our Children, and to our Children's Children, to la&s;t as long as the Mountains and Rivers, and the Sun and Moon &s;hall endure.</P>
<P>I al&s;o give you the&s;e two Pieces of <HI>Blankets,</HI> to wipe away and to dry up the Blood that has been &s;pilt, and to cover it &s;o as that it may never be &s;een or heard of any more.</P>
<P>I live at a great Di&s;tance from the Brethren, and perhaps may never &s;ee &s;o many of your grave ancient Men together again; I will there|fore, like a true Brother, leave with you my be&s;t Advice, for the Happine&s;s and Welfare of all your People: And as oft as you look upon tho&s;e two Belts remember,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two Belts &s;aid down</NOTE> that <HI>This One &s;ignifies the Strength which a wi&s;e Nation acquires and &s;ecures to its People by peaceable Councils; and encrea&s;ing the Number of its Friends:</HI> And this other Belt repre&s;ents to you <HI>A bold, firm, true Heart, that abhors Fal&s;hhood, but is ever faithful to its Friends, and punctually ob&s;erves what&s;oever it promi&s;es.</HI></P>

<P>I. YOU told us in your Propo&s;ition &s;ome Days ago, That you was come a great Way to &s;ee us of the <HI>Five Nations</HI>; We thank you for your Good Will to us, and are very glad to &s;ee you here in good Health: And we hope a good Under&s;tanding and Agreement will be made and concluded between us.</P>
<P>You told us al&s;o, That you are come to renew the Covenant-Chain that has been made between us &s;o long ago, even at the fir&s;t Setling the Province of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> and to brighten the Chain, and to re|move and do away any Spot of Ru&s;t that may be grown upon it &s;ince our la&s;t Meeting and Conference at <HI>Cone&s;togoe.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother Onas,</HI></P>
<P>II. You have told us, That at that Time you brighten'd the Covenant Chain between us, that it might be clear and la&s;ting as the Sun and Stars in Heaven: For which we thank you. And we being now all pre&s;ent, do, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn and publick Manner, renew the Covenant and brighten the Chain made between us. that the Lu&s;tre thereof may never be ob&s;cured by any Clouds or Dark|ne&s;s; but may &s;hine as clear and la&s;t as long as the Sun in the Firmament.</P>
<P><HI>Brother Onas,</HI></P>
<P>III. You have likewi&s;e told us, How <HI>William Penn,</HI> who was a good Man, did, at his fir&s;t Settlement of the Province of <HI>Penn&s;yl|vania,</HI> make Leagues of Friend&s;hip with the <HI>Indians,</HI> and treated them like Brethren; and that, like the &s;ame good Man, he left it in Charge to all his Governors who &s;hould &s;ucceed him, and to all the People of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> that they &s;hould always keep the Covenant and Treaties he had made with the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> and treat them with Love and Kindne&s;s. We acknowledge that his Governors and People have always kept the &s;ame hone&s;tly and truly to this Day: So we on our Part always have kept, and for ever &s;hall keep, firm Peace and Friend&s;hip, with a good Heart, to all the People of <HI>Penn|&s;ylvania.</HI> We thankfully receive and approve of all the Articles in your Propo&s;ition to us, and acknowledge them to be good and full of Love: We receive and approve of the &s;ame with our whole
<PB N="7" REF="002343_0008_0FDBCC8EE20DD988">
Hearts, becau&s;e we are not only made one People by the Covenant&punc; Chain, but we al&s;o are People united in One Head, One Body and One Heart, by the &s;tronge&s;t Ties of Love and Friend&s;hip.</P>
<P><HI>Brother Onas,</HI></P>
<P>IV. You de&s;ire there may be a perpetual Peace and Friend&s;hip between you and the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> and between your Children and our Children, and that the &s;ame may be kept as long as the Moun|tains and Rivers endure. All which we like well, and on our Part de&s;ire, that the Covenant and Union made with a clean and true Heart, between you and us, may la&s;t as long as the Sun and Moon &s;hall continue to give Light. And we will deliver this in Charge to our Children, that it may be kept in Remembrance with their Children, and Children's Children to the late&s;t Ages. And we de&s;ire, That the Peace and Tranquility that is now e&s;tabli&s;hed be|tween us, may be as clear as the Sun &s;hining in its Lu&s;tre, without any Cloud or Darkne&s;s, and that the &s;ame may continue for ever.</P>
<P><HI>Brother Onas,</HI></P>
<P>V. We have well con&s;ider'd all that you have &s;poken, and like it well, becau&s;e it is only the Renewing of former Leagues and Treaties, made between the Government of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> and Us of the <HI>Five Nations</HI>; which we always believed we were obliged to keep. And as to the Accident of one of our Friends being kill'd by &s;ome of your People, which has happen'd by Misfortune and again&s;t your Will, we &s;ay, That as we are all in Peace, we think it hard the Per&s;ons who kill'd our Friend and Brother &s;hould &s;uffer: And we do, in the Name of all the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> forgive the Offence, and de&s;ire you will likewi&s;e forgive it; and that the Men who did it may be relea&s;ed from Pri&s;on, and &s;et at Liberty to go whither they plea&s;e. And we &s;hall e&s;teem that as a Mark of Regard and Friend|&s;hip for the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> and as a farther Confirmation of this Treaty.</P>
<P><HI>Brother Onas,</HI></P>
<P>VI. We &s;ay farther, We are glad to hear the former Treaties we have made with <HI>William Penn</HI> repeated to us again, and renewed by you; and we e&s;teem and love you, as if you were <HI>William Penn</HI> Him&s;elf. We are glad you have wip'd away and cover'd the Blood of our dead Friend and Brother; and we de&s;ire the &s;ame may be forgot, &s;o as it may never be more mentioned or remembred.</P>
<P>It is needle&s;s for us to an&s;wer every Particular of your Propo&s;ition, becau&s;e we acknowledge the Whole to be good and acceptable to us; e&s;pecially your good Advice, which we will always remember: And in Te&s;timony thereof, and as a full Confirmation of our Agree|ment, Con&s;ent and Approbation of all that you have propo&s;ed, and we have here &s;aid and promi&s;ed, we lay down a few Beaver, Bear and dre&s;s'd Deer Skins: <HI>And &s;o concluded.</HI></P></Q>
<P>Then the Governor expre&s;s'd his Satisfaction with their An&s;wer; and gave them Thanks for their Good Will and Love to Him, and the People of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> then de&s;ired to know of the Governor, <HI>If the Men who were in Pri&s;on for Killing their Friend and Brother were di&s;charged?</HI> To which the Governor an&s;wered, That "they were let out upon Bail."
<PB N="8" REF="002343_0009_0FDBCCAC5312A8F0">
They then de&s;ired, That <HI>the Men might be di&s;charged:</HI> To which the Governor an&s;wered, That as &s;oon as he returned to <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> he would give &s;uch Orders in that Affair, as &s;hould fully An&s;wer the Reque&s;t of the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> in Order to confirm the Friend&s;hip that is &s;o happily renewed and e&s;tabli&s;hed by this Treaty.</P>

<P>The Chiefs of the <HI>Indians</HI> expre&s;s'd a great Affection for the Governor and the People of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania.</HI> And it appeared that <HI>Satcheechoe</HI> had faithfully di&s;charged his Tru&s;t in both the Me&s;&s;ages &s;ent by him.</P>
<P>When our Interpreters were coming away the Chiefs informed them, That they had &s;omething further to &s;ay to the Governor; upon which they were detained. The next Day, the 14th of <HI>September,</HI> the Governor received at his Chamber the Ten Chiefs of the Five Nations, being Two from each; together with Two others, &s;aid to be of the <HI>Tu&s;cororoes</HI>: And by the Interpretation of <HI>Lawrence Clae&s;e,</HI> Publick Interpreter for the <HI>Indians,</HI> in the Pre&s;ence of <HI>Philip Living&s;ton,</HI> Secretary for <HI>Indian</HI> Affairs at <HI>Albany,</HI> both whom our Governor de&s;ired to be pre&s;ent, they &s;poke as follows:</P>
<Q><P>Brother Onas,</P>
<P><HI>WE here now freely &s;urrender to you all tho&s;e Lands about</HI> Cone&s;togoe, <HI>which the</HI> Five Nations <HI>have claimed: And it is our De&s;ire that the &s;ame may be &s;etled with <HI>Chri&s;tians;</HI> in Token whereof we give this String of Wampum.</HI></P>
<P>Brother Onas, <HI>According to the be&s;t of our Under&s;tanding, we have renew'd at this Time with you all former Treaties between your People and us; we there|fore expect, that if any of our People come to trade at</HI> Philadelphia, <HI>you will order that they be received like Brethren, and have the Goods as cheap as po&s;&s;ible. So we wi&s;h you all Pro&s;perity and a good Journey Home.</HI></P>
<P>Now we are going to depart from one another, we your Brethren, the <HI>Sachims of the</HI> Five Nations, <HI>de&s;ire that you would give us &s;ome Provi&s;ions, to help us on our Journey.</HI> On which they gave 2 &s;mall Bundles of Beaver and dre&s;s'd Skins.</P></Q>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Brethren,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU know very well, that the Lands about <HI>Cone&s;togoe,</HI> upon the River <HI>Sa&s;quehannah,</HI> belong to your old Friend and kind Brother <HI>William Penn</HI>; neverthele&s;s I do here, in his Name, kindly accept of the Offer and Surrender which you have now made to me, becau&s;e it will put an End to all other Claims and Di&s;putes, if any &s;hould be made hereafter.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI> I under&s;tand, as you do, that we here at this Time renew'd all former Treaties between the <HI>Five Nations</HI> and <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI>; and con|&s;idering how well you are provided with Goods at <HI>Albany,</HI> I think <HI>Phila|delphia</HI> will be far out of your Way to trade; but as often as any of your People come to us in Love and Friend&s;hip, they &s;hall be treated like Brethren.</P>
<P>I am not able to provide for you here as if I were at Home; but I will order &s;ome Bread to be got for your particular U&s;e: And I heartily wi&s;h you well Home to your own Families.</P>
