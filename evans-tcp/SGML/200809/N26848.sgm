<BIBL>COLOSSIANS III. 11.</BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Obligation to love and obey GOD which ari&s;es from the perpetual depend|ence of men, <HI>as intelligent creatures,</HI> upon GOD, con&s;idered as their CREATOR, is the religion of nature. The relation formed by this de|pendence obliges them to be devoted to the &s;ervice and glory of him who made, pre&s;erves and governs them. In this religion GOD the CREATOR is all and in all.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="035738_0004_10064F41D04901A0">Revealed religion is that obligation to love and obey GOD, which re&s;ults from the total dependence of men, <HI>as &s;inners,</HI> upon GOD con&s;idered as their REDEEMER. The rela|tion produced by this dependence obliges them to be devoted to the &s;ervice and glory of him who has atoned for their &s;ins, and is become the LORD their Righteou&s;ne&s;s. In this reli|gion GOD the REDEEMER is all and in all.</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle adopts this very principle, and confirms it in the text by terms the mo&s;t com|prehen&s;ive and unequivocal.&mdash;"There is nei|ther Greek nor Jew, circumci&s;ion nor uncir|cumci&s;ion, barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but CHRIST is all and in all."</P>
<P>Believers are ri&s;en with CHRIST. They are therefore to place their affections upon things above&mdash;to mortify their members which are upon earth&mdash;to put off the old man&mdash;and put on the new.&mdash;From the&s;e duties, no exemption can be pleaded; for the omi&s;&s;ion of them, no excu&s;e admitted. The learned and the igno|rant, the civilized and the &s;avage, the Greek and the Jew, all who believe, without di&s;tinc|tion of nation, name or condition, are brought into the &s;ame relation to GOD, renewed into the &s;ame in age, and bound to univer&s;al obedi|ence and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> by the &s;ame principle&mdash;for CHRIST is all and in all.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="035738_0005_10064F435A433C70">The phra&s;e expre&s;&s;es in a &s;ummary manner every thing that can be predicated of the &s;ub|ject. It is applied in the pa&s;&s;age before us and in Ephe&s;. i. 23, to the divine REDEEMER, and in 1 Cor. xv. 28, to GOD in the mo&s;t exten&s;ive view, comprehending every relation he &s;u&s;tains to his intelligent creatures.</P>
<P>CHRIST <HI>is all,</HI> he is every thing e&s;&s;ential in the &s;alvation of &s;inners; he is this to all and <HI>in all,</HI> the happy objects of his love. There are no local or per&s;onal di&s;criminations. No exclu|&s;ive privileges or monopoly of benefits. "Nei|ther is there &s;alvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we mu&s;t be &s;aved." He is the &s;ame LORD, and his power and grace the &s;ame for all, and to all who call upon him.</P>
<P>The fulne&s;s of the REDEEMER is frequently inculcated, in &s;imilar comprehen&s;ive &s;entences. David &s;ays of him, "all my &s;prings are in thee"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. lxxxvii. 7.</NOTE>&mdash;"the LORD is my rock, and my fortre&s;s, and my deliverer, my GOD, my &s;trength"<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. xviii. 2.</NOTE>"the LORD is my light and my &s;alvation&mdash;the LORD is the &s;trength of my life."<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. xxvii. 1.</NOTE> Paul calls him "the captain of &s;alva|tion"<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Heb. ii. 10.</NOTE>&mdash;"the author and fini&s;her of our faith."<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Heb. xii. 2.</NOTE>

And the ble&s;&s;ed Saviour declares concerning him&s;elf, "I am Alpha and Omega&mdash;the begin|ning and the ending&mdash;the fir&s;t and the la&s;t."<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">Rev. i. 8, 17.</NOTE> The&s;e, and innumerable pa&s;&s;ages which a&s;cribe to him the glory of pardon and peace, of pre|&s;ent comfort and future happine&s;s, are &s;um|med up in the emphatical words of the text, CHRIST IS ALL AND IN ALL.</P>
<P>CHRIST is an official name. It re&s;pects the exalted offices the REDEEMER &s;u&s;tained, and the va&s;t work, which as GOD and man in one per&s;on he accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P>He mu&s;t be man, a perfect man, that the law may be obeyed and &s;atisfied, in the &s;ame nature which had &s;inned. He mu&s;t be GOD, the true GOD, becau&s;e no mere creature po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es a right to lay down his life and a&s;&s;ign his merits to others&mdash;becau&s;e, it requires infinite wi&s;dom, love and power, to procure for and ap|ply &s;alvation to the guilty and depraved&mdash;and becau&s;e, redemption con&s;titutes a new claim to an exclu&s;ive property in, and dominion over the redeemed. But the LORD will not give his glory or alienate his claim to another. "I looked," &s;aith he, "and there was none to help&mdash;therefore mine own arm brought &s;alva|tion."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;ai. lxiii. 5.</NOTE>&mdash;"I, even I am the LORD, and be&s;ides

<P>So much of the my&s;terious manner of the divine exi&s;tence is revealed; &s;o much of GOD the Father, of GOD the Son, and of GOD the Holy Gho&s;t, the one, the only living and true GOD, as &s;uffices, not to gratify un&s;anctified curio&s;ity, but to inform believers in what manner JEHOVAH can become their RE|DEEMER.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of the union between the divine nature of the Son of GOD and the hu|man nature which he a&s;&s;umed, his whole per|&s;on as GOD manife&s;ted in the fle&s;h, is de|&s;ignated by the name of CHRIST. The Apo&s;tle therefore, in the words before us, adopts and confirms the principle, that in revealed religion, GOD the REDEEMER is all and in all.</P>
<P>No &s;ubject can be more acceptable to tho&s;e who love the LORD JESUS CHRIST. None more &s;ea&s;onable when adver&s;aries openly bla&s;|pheme that &s;acred name. And none more &s;uitable to the character in which we now ap|pear in his hou&s;e and the work in which we profe&s;s to be engaged.&mdash;Father of lights, &s;ource of every good and every perfect gift, remove

the covering which hides thy glories from our view. Increa&s;e and &s;trengthen our faith to enter within the vail, that beholding with open face, we may be changed into the &s;ame image, from glory to glory!</P>
<P>CHRIST is all and in all. Every thing great, intere&s;ting and nece&s;&s;ary in &s;alvation is ju&s;tly predicated of him.&mdash;Of a propo&s;ition &s;o general, which comprehends the whole &s;y&s;tem, &s;preads over all the doctrines, and blends with every article of our creed, the details cannot po&s;&s;ibly be con&s;idered in the pre&s;ent hour. As a &s;ummary of fir&s;t principles, it mu&s;t &s;uffice to &s;hew, that CHRIST is all and in all,&mdash;in the &s;acred &s;criptures&mdash;in the religion of &s;inners&mdash; and in providence.</P>
<P N="1">I. In the &s;acred &s;criptures CHRIST is all and in all.</P>
<P>The <HI>Scriptures</HI> te&s;tify of CHRIST&mdash;in the law of Mo&s;es, in the Prophets, and in the P&s;alms, it is written concerning him, that he was to come, to &s;uffer, and to ri&s;e from the dead, and that repentance and remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins &s;hould be preached in his name among all na|tions.&mdash;In the Go&s;pels and Epi&s;tles the ac|compli&s;hment of the&s;e predictions is recorded, and the doctrines of his grace explained and confirmed.&mdash;The Acts of the Apo&s;tles exhibit
<PB N="9" REF="035738_0009_10064F4C77A289D8">
him in his maje&s;ty riding pro&s;perou&s;ly, &s;ending the rod of his &s;trength out of Zion, and ruling in the mid&s;t of his enemies.&mdash;The la&s;t book of the &s;acred canon is the Revelation of JESUS CHRIST, the LORD, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the ALMIGHTY. It foretels the pro&s;perous and adver&s;e &s;tate of his Church, the ri&s;e and de&s;truction of his ene|mies, and his complete and the final triumph. The volume opens with the promi&s;e of his fir&s;t appearance. It clo&s;es with an a&s;&s;urance of his &s;econd coming. The Scriptures are full of CHRIST.&mdash;Look at every part of the Sacred Word.</P>
<P>The HISTORICAL <HI>pa&s;&s;ages</HI> even of the Old Te&s;tament, refer to Him. The hi&s;tory of creation&mdash;the fall of man&mdash;the univer&s;al deluge &mdash;the call of Abraham&mdash;and the lives of the patriarchs. The &s;eries of events which re&s;pect that people, of whom as concerning the fle&s;h CHRIST came, and the mention of other na|tions with who&s;e fate that people was in &s;ome mea&s;ure connected, all point to the &s;ame ob|ject. They are all introduced, to demon&s;trate the nece&s;&s;ity of a Saviour, and di&s;cover the marvellous &s;teps by which providence gradu|ally prepared for the coming of MESSIAH.</P>
<P>The PROMISES are all in CHRIST, yea, and in him amen. In him they unite, for his
<PB N="10" REF="035738_0010_10064F4AEB657B58">
&s;ake they were made, and through him they become valid and &s;ure. What re&s;pects him|&s;elf is the principal promi&s;e. The repetition, explanation and confirmation of this, engro&s;s the chief attention of the &s;acred writers, and run, as golden threads, through every leaf of the in&s;pired volume.</P>
<P>The WORSHIP under the law was de&s;ign|ed to direct believers to the MESSIAH.&mdash;The municipal in&s;titutes of a nation in which the Church and State were united, mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be compri&s;ed in the &s;ame code with the eccle&s;i|a&s;tical, and ultimately refer to the &s;ame object. For his &s;ake the theocracy was formed. To &s;ecure the fulfilment of the promi&s;es re&s;pecting him, that people were &s;eparated and dwelt alone until Shiloh came. The moral law was e&s;pecially magnified by his active and pa&s;&s;ive obedience, and proved to be holy, ju&s;t and good. In the whole, he is intended. To him it is calculated to lead lo&s;t &s;inners. CHRIST is the end of the law.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gal. iii. 24.</NOTE></P>
<P>The DEVOTIONAL pa&s;&s;ages of Scripture all look to Him by whom alone &s;inners find acce&s;s to the Throne. It was faith in him as yet to come, which in&s;pired the &s;ong of the Old Te&s;|tament Saints, and tuned their harps to prai&s;e. It is faith in him who has come and wa&s;hed us
<PB N="11" REF="035738_0011_10064F4E73CCB630">
from our &s;ins in his own blood, that now rai&s;es the voice of rejoicing and &s;alvation in the ta|bernacles of the righteous.</P>
<P>The DOCTRINES in Scripture, like &s;o many bright lines within the &s;ame circle, unite in one glorious point. It is in the face of JESUS CHRIST that the light of the knowledge of the glory of GOD &s;hines mo&s;t illu&s;triou&s;ly. Bani&s;h CHRIST from the doctrines, and a &s;y&s;tem lu|minous, connected and &s;imple, becomes dark, perplexed and broken.</P>
<P>There are detached facts, individual doc|trines, moral precepts, which, in them&s;elves, are excellent, and independently on CHRIST or his glorious go&s;pel, cannot fail of claiming approbation and applau&s;e.&mdash;But it will be found, when viewed in their connection, that the&s;e facts are all combined with others which have an immediate re&s;pect to the Saviour&mdash; that the&s;e doctrines either appertain to the re|ligion of nature and are adopted of cour&s;e into the Chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem, or they form a part of other doctrines which directly relate to CHRIST. And that the&s;e moral precepts are calculated to convince of guilt and direct &s;inners to &s;eek an intere&s;t in his atonement; or they pre&s;cribe a rule of life, by which his people are to ex|pre&s;s their gratitude for &s;aving mercies.&mdash;They are all, it is confe&s;&s;ed, excellent in them&s;elves;
<PB N="12" REF="035738_0012_10064F536351DEC0">
but their highe&s;t excellence, their exten&s;ive and true meaning, can be di&s;cerned alone, by ob&s;erving the expre&s;s relation they bear to the divine REDEEMER.</P>
<P>There are in the Scriptures, "&s;ome things hard to be under&s;tood, which they that are un|learned and un&s;table wre&s;t unto their own de|&s;truction." (2 Pet. iii. 16.)&mdash;The prophecies, antecedent to their accompli&s;hment, mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be, in a great mea&s;ure, ob&s;cure.&mdash; The doctrines which re&s;pect the Holy Tri|nity&mdash;the Word made fle&s;h&mdash;the operation of the Spirit&mdash;the &s;overeignty of GOD, and a total dependence upon him, are too &s;ublime and my&s;terious to be fully comprehended by finite minds. And what relates to the depra|vity of human nature, with the in&s;eparable con&s;equences of guilt and &s;in, are directly op|po&s;ed to the pride and prejudices of men. The&s;e are &s;o many &s;ources of difficulty. The&s;e render &s;ome things hard to be under&s;tood, and &s;till harder to be cordially embraced. Yet, the&s;e notwith&s;tanding, all who are taught of GOD di&s;cover a per&s;picuity &s;ufficient to render them wi&s;e unto &s;alvation, and they delight to meditate upon the word. None cavil but the ignorant and profane. None but they com|plain, that clouds and darkne&s;s re&s;t upon the Scriptures.&mdash;Whatever it may be in regard to other matters, it is certainly beyond contra|diction
<PB N="13" REF="035738_0013_10064F5718A65168">
that in CHRIST the hi&s;tory of the Bible terminates&mdash;he is the &s;um of the pro|mi&s;es&mdash;the end of the law&mdash;the &s;pirit of the devotion, and the principal object to which the whole is uniformly directed. He was meant in the types, &s;hadowed forth in the rites, and expre&s;sly intended in all the &s;acri|fices. He is the &s;um, the &s;cope of the Old and of the New Te&s;tament. In the Sacred Scriptures CHRIST is all and in all&punc;</P>
<P>The man, therefore, who reads the Bible without finding the Saviour there, is blind. And the mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel who, to avoid offence, or recommend him&s;elf to the wicked, conceals the exalted REDEEMER, is a mad|man; e&s;pecially as,</P>
<P N="2">II. CHRIST is all and in all in the religion of &s;inners.</P>
<P>That religion which removes the fatal con|&s;equences of &s;in&mdash;permits the guilty and de|praved to wor&s;hip in an acceptable manner&mdash; re&s;tores to the favour and communion of GOD &mdash;admini&s;ters con&s;olation, and produces in the i&s;&s;ue, perfection and happine&s;s, that, and that alone, can be denominated the religion of &s;inners. Every thing &s;hort of this mu&s;t be inadequate to their exigencies, mu&s;t be in&s;uf|ficient for their &s;alvation.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="035738_0014_10064F54F012A018">The religion of nature is far from an&s;wering the&s;e exalted purpo&s;es.&mdash;From the definitions with which this di&s;cour&s;e was introduced, and &s;ome ob&s;ervations that have tran&s;iently occur|red, you may perhaps already anticipate what appertains to this part of the &s;ubject. It is however of too great importance to be &s;lightly treated. It draws a line of di&s;tinction, with which many are evidently unacquainted. And it &s;ugge&s;ts a principle, of all others the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential, in refuting the fal&s;e philo&s;ophy of infidelity.</P>
<P>No obligation, and con&s;equently no reli|gion, can exi&s;t without &s;ome RELATION to con&s;titute a ba&s;is or foundation upon which it re&s;ts. The foundation of the religion of nature is the <HI>relation</HI> which ari&s;es from the depend|ence of men con&s;idered as intelligent creatures, upon GOD as their CREATOR. This relation will not &s;uffice for &s;inners.</P>
<P>The religion of nature is univer&s;al and un|changeable. It pre&s;cribes perfect and perpe|tual obedience, as its only po&s;&s;ible condition; and it en&s;ures happine&s;s as long as a per&s;e|verance in &s;uch obedience is uninterruptedly maintained. But it contemplates no deviation from the divine law. It knows of no remedy for tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors. A &s;inner is a mon&s;ter un|known and unacknowledged in the religion of
<PB N="15" REF="035738_0015_10064F58AD7878F0">
nature. A Saviour is a gift infinitely beyond its province or prerogative.</P>
<P>Sin con&s;titutes a new character. It pro|duces e&s;&s;ential embarra&s;&s;ments. It requires help which nothing in the relation between creatures and their CREATOR, as &s;uch, can &s;ugge&s;t or &s;upply. The new character renders a <HI>new relation</HI> nece&s;&s;ary. There mu&s;t be a REDEEMER, or the evils produced by &s;in can never be removed. He alone who made them can redeem them, form the relation, and bring them into it.</P>
<P>The religion of nature is nece&s;&s;arily and for|ever binding upon all men as intelligent be|ings. The original obligation can never cea&s;e or abate. Nothing can infringe, nothing can de&s;troy it. The religion of nature, in this re|&s;pect, is as much the religion of men, after they become &s;inners, as it would have been had they continued holy and perfect; and yet by not providing happine&s;s, is e&s;&s;entially deficient in a mo&s;t important article.&mdash;If it obliges the &s;inner to obedience, while it condemns, and leaves him to all the direful con&s;equences of his tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion&mdash;if the <HI>relation</HI> upon which it is founded does not reach the new character&mdash; if the only <HI>condition</HI> it pre&s;cribes, of <HI>do this and live,</HI> cannot po&s;&s;ibly be complied with, and if the <HI>principle</HI> that inve&s;tigates this obligation,
<PB N="16" REF="035738_0016_10064F5D17F70E38">
is not competent to the di&s;covery of any other, that will obviate the complicated mi&s;eries pro|duced by &s;in, then the religion of nature can|not &s;ave, then it is not, and cannot be, the religion that will &s;uffice for &s;inners.</P>
<P>Two obligations, each demanding the whole heart, ari&s;ing from two di&s;tinct relations, would interfere and prove incon&s;i&s;tent, were they due to di&s;tinct Beings. No man can &s;erve two ma&s;ters.&mdash;But if both relations originate from the &s;ame &s;ource, and terminate in the &s;ame ob|ject; if he who is the CREATOR, be al&s;o the REDEEMER, no different intere&s;ts, no cla&s;hing of authority, no incon&s;i&s;tency can ari&s;e from the additional obligation. The duties may &s;weetly blend, and one harmonious, rational and divine &s;ervice be the ble&s;&s;ed re&s;ult.</P>
<P>All the&s;e defects are compen&s;ated, all the&s;e important ends obtained in revealed religion. This fully recognizes and cordially embraces, as of nece&s;&s;ity it ought, the religion of nature. But it does much more. It meets the new charac|ter. It reveals a new relation. It opens a new acce&s;s to GOD and happine&s;s. And in this, its e&s;&s;ential peculiarity con&s;i&s;ts.</P>
<P>Revealed religion con&s;iders men as &s;inners, and expre&s;sly treats with them as &s;uch. CHRIST came to call, not the righteous, but &s;inners to
<PB N="17" REF="035738_0017_10064F5EA4ADF808">
repentance. The whole need not a phy&s;ician, but the &s;ick. This is the religion which pro|fe&s;&s;edly provides a remedy again&s;t &s;in. The only religion that informs &s;inners what they mu&s;t do to be &s;aved. That procures accept|ance for their per&s;ons and &s;ervices&mdash;affords comfort in affliction&mdash;a&s;&s;uages the pangs of an accu&s;ing con&s;cience&mdash;promotes holine&s;s in heart and life&mdash;and opens a pro&s;pect of eternal re&s;t and glory. This therefore, with propriety, may be called THE RELIGION OF SINNERS.</P>
<P>Now, in this religion CHRIST is all and in all. With re&s;pect to the foundation upon which it is built&mdash;the benefits derived from it&mdash;and the duties to which it binds.</P>
<P>What is the language of the Prophets in regard to the FOUNDATION of that religion which can &s;ave &s;inners?

<P>The different &s;tages through which the Church mu&s;t pa&s;s, the progre&s;&s;ive manner in which all this will be obtained, are indi&s;puta|bly marked in the prophetic vi&s;ion which Da|niel interpreted.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Daniel ii. 34, 35, 44.</NOTE>&mdash;"A &s;tone was cut out without hands, which &s;mote the image&mdash;and the &s;tone which &s;mote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth&mdash;in the days of the&s;e kings &s;hall the GOD of hea|ven &s;et up a kingdom, which &s;hall never be de&s;troyed, and the kingdom &s;hall not be left to other people, but it &s;hall break in pieces and con&s;ume all the&s;e kingdoms, and it &s;hall &s;tand forever."</P>
<P>Let it &s;uffice to remark upon this celebrated prophecy: that the Church, the vi&s;ible king|dom of CHRIST in the world, is here exhibited as remaining for a &s;eries of ages,&mdash;&s;mall and circum&s;cribed in its limits&mdash;moveable and changing its place&mdash;&s;uffering and expo&s;ed to buffetings and in&s;ults. A &s;tate, very aptly de|&s;ignated by comparing it to a &s;tone. But a

<P>During the fir&s;t period, (by a learned expo|&s;itor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>JOSEPH MEDE.</HI>&mdash;Regnum lapidis&mdash;Regnum montis.</NOTE> called the kingdom of the &s;tone) the wicked have been permitted to exert their ut|mo&s;t efforts of malice and power again&s;t the anointed King of Zion. Enemies from with|out have a&s;&s;aulted the Church with violent per&s;ecutions; and an enemy within, more for|midable from his &s;ituation, has made deeper thru&s;ts, corrupted the truth, and worn out the &s;aints with cruel oppre&s;&s;ion. But, when the&s;e have wa&s;ted their &s;trength, and the gates of hell oppo&s;ed in vain; at the period fixed for the di&s;play of the Saviour's grace and glory in the world, his Church will &s;uddenly a&s;&s;ume a new form. Her mourning be turned into joy, her widow's weed exchanged for the garment of &s;alvation. The &s;tone will rapidly grow into a mountain. The kingdom of CHRIST literally fill the whole earth.&mdash;Thus it will be grateful|ly acknowledged that he admini&s;ters the go|vernment; it will then be &s;een with rapture, that his glory is the <HI>end;</HI> and mankind will hail the divine REDEEMER as al&s;o, all and in all in providence.</P>

An immortal &s;oul ca|pable of receiving the divine image, of know|ing, loving, and &s;erving GOD in con&s;ummate bli&s;s forever, is not a little thing. Millions of &s;uch are not beneath the notice and care of the Supreme.&mdash;Small and great are comparative terms. No part of the moral creation is in it|&s;elf incon&s;iderable. The harmony which mu&s;t &s;ub&s;i&s;t in the divine government, the connec|tion of &s;y&s;tems, the influence of worlds upon worlds, of every part of the va&s;t dominion of GOD upon the whole, of pre&s;ent tran&s;actions upon the ages of eternity, render it ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible for finite minds to e&s;timate what is &s;mall or great, or determine upon the que&s;tion of propriety and right.&mdash;If God de&s;igns to magnify his love and di&s;play the riches of his grace, in &s;aving even the lea&s;t, the younge&s;t of the family, it may be expected, that in the plan and accompli&s;hment, it will be worthy of him|&s;elf.

Nothing is too great for GOD. The ends hereby attained may not only reach the redeemed, but in their ble&s;|&s;ed con&s;equences extend to the whole creation, and produce mo&s;t glorious and &s;alutary effects to all eternity. Whatever it may be, his thoughts are not our thoughts, nor are our ways his ways. Far then from exclaiming, how can the&s;e things be? or rai&s;ing objections from the character and relative in&s;ignificance of man, it becomes us to believe and adore. The difficulty of reconciling &s;uch proceedings in the moral government to our views and expec|tations, &s;erves rather to enhance the value of this great &s;alvation, confirm its certainty, and prompt us with cheerfulne&s;s to &s;ubmit to the glorious go&s;pel of the LORD JESUS CHRIST.</P>

But the precepts are too &s;evere, the doctrines too humbling, and the Saviour too holy, to meet their un&s;anctified approba|tion. They hate the Author and wreak their malice upon his book. Had the Bible been only a republication of the religion of nature&punc; had no other relation but that of CREATOR been revealed, the &s;y&s;tem would have been more acceptable, the re&s;i&s;tance le&s;s &s;trenuous.

<P>Know, ye profane, ye infidels be warned, that to reject revealed religion is in the i&s;&s;ue to ca&s;t off al&s;o that of nature. He that hates GOD the REDEEMER cannot love GOD the CREATOR.

<P>The Prophet did as he was commanded. And what was the con&s;equence? <HI>As I pro|phe&s;ied,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>there was a noi&s;e, and behold a &s;haking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone. And when I beheld, lo, the &s;inews and the fle&s;h came up upon them, and the &s;kin covered them above.</HI></P>
<P>As yet, however, they were but dead bodies: for he adds, <HI>there was no breath in them.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="035738_0051_10064FAE17C45DA8">He then receives a &s;econd commi&s;&s;ion. <HI>Pro|phe&s;y unto the wind, prophe&s;y, &s;on of man, and &s;ay to the wind, Thus &s;aith the</HI> LORD GOD, <HI>Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon the&s;e &s;lain, that they may live.</HI></P>
<P>He did &s;o. <HI>I prophe&s;ied,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and &s;tood upon their feet, an exceeding great army.</HI></P>
<P>What an a&s;toni&s;hing &s;ight was this! A great multitude of dry bones, lying di&s;per&s;ed in an open valley, fir&s;t, put into motion; then, coming together, bone to his bone; the &s;inews and the fle&s;h afterwards coming up upon them; and the &s;kin covering them above; and, final|ly, becoming animated, ari&s;ing, and &s;tanding upon their feet an exceeding great army.</P>
<P>The primary object, to which this prophetic vi&s;ion referred, was, the recovery of the Jews from their captivity, in Babylon, and their re&s;toration to their own land. This is evident from the application, in the eleventh ver&s;e. <HI>Son of man, the&s;e bones are the whole hou&s;e of I&s;rael.</HI></P>
<P>They had been now &s;eventy years in capti|vity. Their pre&s;ent circum&s;tances were very unpromi&s;ing for a re&s;toration. Like the bones,
<PB N="52" REF="035738_0052_10064FAFA15DCB38">
in the valley of vi&s;ion, they were di&s;per&s;ed over the whole face of the country; and, like dry bones, they were hopele&s;s, heartle&s;s, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of none of the means of their recove|ry. Therefore, they &s;aid, <HI>Our bones are dried, and our hope is lo&s;t, we are cut off for our part.</HI></P>
<P>But the time de&s;tined in the divine purpo&s;e, and which had been predicted by the prophets, as the period of their captivity, was accom|pli&s;hed. The time of their deliverance was come. And by this prophetic repre&s;entation GOD would revive and &s;trengthen the faith and hope of his people. He would &s;hew them that though their &s;ituation was as unpromi&s;ing for a re&s;toration, as that a multitude of dry bones, di&s;per&s;ed in a valley, &s;hould live; yet, it &s;hould be effected: <HI>not by might, nor by power, but by my &s;pirit, &s;aith the</HI> LORD. <HI>There|fore prophe&s;y upon the&s;e dry bones, and &s;ay unto them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of the</HI> LORD.</P>
<P>What is here predicted, and emblematically repre&s;ented to the prophet was realized and accompli&s;hed when, upon the proclamation of Cyrus, who had been prophe&s;ied of, by name, for this expre&s;s purpo&s;e, upwards of one hun|dred and fifty years before, the Jews returned
<PB N="53" REF="035738_0053_10064FB2468674B8">
to their own land, and rebuilt their city and temple.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the primary intent of this prophetic repre&s;entation there are &s;everal other objects to which it may be ju&s;tly referred. Permit me now to direct your attention to the&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">I. This vi&s;ion may be con&s;idered as an emblematical repre&s;entation of the recovery of the &s;inner from a &s;tate of &s;piritual death, to &s;piritual life and happine&s;s, by the means of grace, and through the effectual operations of the Holy Spirit of GOD.</P>
<P>However &s;ome may boa&s;t of the dignity and powers of human nature; or, whatever its natural, intellectual, political or moral abilities may be; yet, how to perform &s;piritual actions, in a holy and &s;piritual manner, whil&s;t in his natural &s;tate, man findeth not. The powers of the &s;oul are not le&s;s deranged, nor its com|petency, for &s;piritual action, le&s;s de&s;troyed by &s;in, than tho&s;e of the body are by natural death. Univer&s;al experience confirms the truth of tho&s;e &s;cripture declarations; that every imagination of the thoughts of man's heart is only evil continually; that he is a&s;leep in &s;ecurity, and dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins; that the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of GOD, for they are fooli&s;hne&s;s unto him, neither
<PB N="54" REF="035738_0054_10064FB3F09E7CC8">
can he know them becau&s;e they are &s;piritually di&s;cerned; that the carnal mind is enmity again&s;t GOD: for it is not &s;ubject to the law of GOD, neither indeed can be; and that the exertion of the &s;ame Almighty Power which created the world, at fir&s;t, out of nothing, by which JESUS CHRIST was rai&s;ed from the dead, and by which our bodies &s;hall be rai&s;ed at the la&s;t day, is nece&s;&s;ary to quicken the &s;inner to a &s;piritual life, and to make him alive unto GOD.</P>
<P>If there are any of you who have not found this to be the ca&s;e, be a&s;&s;ured, you are yet &s;trangers to your condition. You know not the plagues of your own hearts; you are &s;tran|gers to the glorious perfections and character of GOD, and to the holine&s;s, &s;pirituality, ex|tent, and power of his law; you are yet with|out GOD, without CHRIST, and without hope in the world.</P>
<P>When, therefore, we preach the go&s;pel to &s;inners, and call upon them to repent, to be converted and to believe, we are in preci&s;ely &s;imilar circum&s;tances with the prophet when he prophe&s;ied, &s;aying, <HI>O ye dry bones, hear the word of the</HI> LORD. Did our &s;ucce&s;s depend on human probabilities, or the natural efficacy of even in&s;tituted means, never, until time
<PB N="55" REF="035738_0055_10064FB5876E8AC8">
&s;hould give place to eternity, would we con|vert one &s;oul.</P>
<P>But we know that it is the will of GOD the go&s;pel &s;hould be preached to every creature; and that we &s;hould per&s;uade men by all the terror of the LORD, and by all the allurements of his mercy and grace to be reconciled unto him. We know, that by the preaching of the word, and other gracious in&s;titutions GOD is, from time to time, adding to the Church &s;uch as &s;hall be &s;aved. We know that his power has been illu&s;triou&s;ly di&s;played in the conver|&s;ion of thou&s;ands and tens of thou&s;ands alrea|dy; that it is &s;till equally competent for accom|pli&s;hing the de&s;igns of his grace; and that his word &s;hall not return unto him void, but &s;hall accompli&s;h that which he plea&s;es, and pro&s;per in the thing whereto he &s;ends it. And how|ever unpromi&s;ing appearances may be, even though &s;inners &s;hould increa&s;e unto more un|godline&s;s under our mini&s;trations, &s;till there is ground of encouragement. <HI>Behold, the</HI> LORD's <HI>hand is not &s;hortened, that it cannot &s;ave: neither is his ear heavy, that it cannot hear. Therefore we both labour, and &s;uffer reproach, becau&s;e we tru&s;t in the living</HI> GOD <HI>who is the Saviour of all men, e&s;pecially of tho&s;e that believe.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. Another object to which this prophetic vi&s;ion may be referred is, the recovery of the
<PB N="56" REF="035738_0056_10064FB94B437410">
Church and people of GOD from a &s;tate of deadne&s;s, degeneracy and declen&s;ion, to a &s;tate of liveline&s;s, vigour, and &s;piritual pro&s;perity. Happy would it be, for the children and peo|ple of GOD, were they always progre&s;&s;ive in the divine life: going from &s;trength to &s;trength, reaching forth unto tho&s;e things which are be|fore, and pre&s;&s;ing towards the mark for the prize of the high calling of GOD in CHRIST JESUS. What high attainments in grace might they not reach! What abundant peace and con|&s;olation might they not enjoy! This, however, is not the ca&s;e. Through the influence of re|maining corruption, and the numerous tempta|tions to which they are expo&s;ed; by negligence in duty, and not duly improving that provi&s;ion of grace and &s;trength which is made for them in their glorious covenant head, they are liable to awful back&s;lidings and declen&s;ions. In the&s;e circum&s;tances, however, GOD will not leave his children. He has betrothed them unto him&s;elf in faithfulne&s;s and forever. They &s;hall not, ei|ther totally or finally depart from him; nor will he turn away from them to do them good. He will reclaim them by tender mercies, or the rod. Hence the commi&s;&s;ion to the prophet, <HI>Go and proclaim the&s;e words towards the north, and &s;ay, Return thou back&s;liding I&s;rael. Turn, O back&s;liding children, &s;aith the</HI> LORD, <HI>for I am married unto you.</HI> Hence al&s;o tho&s;e gra|cious declarations and promi&s;es, <HI>I will not cau&s;e
<PB N="57" REF="035738_0057_10064FBAD2822CA8">
mine anger to fall upon you. I will heal their back&s;liding, I will love them freely: for mine anger is turned away from him. Though ye have lain among the pots, yet &s;hall ye be as the wings of a dove covered with &s;ilver, and her feathers with yellow gold.</HI></P>
<P>What the people of GOD are liable to, indi|vidually, may, and often doth befal them in a collective capacity. The Church of GOD has often been confined to a comparatively &s;mall number. Through the abounding of iniquity, the love of the righteous may wax cold. There are times when the wi&s;e virgins &s;lumber and &s;leep with the fooli&s;h. There are &s;ea&s;ons al&s;o, when the powers of earth and hell are &s;o let loo&s;e and combined together again&s;t the Church as to threaten its entire de&s;truction.</P>
<P>But to whatever difficulties or dangers the cau&s;e and intere&s;t of the REDEEMER may be expo&s;ed in the world, they &s;hall &s;ucceed. <HI>Though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the mid&s;t of the &s;ea; Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains &s;hake with the &s;welling thereof.</HI> GOD <HI>is in the mid&s;t of her: &s;he &s;hall not be moved:</HI> GOD <HI>&s;hall help her, and that right early.</HI> GOD has founded his Church upon the Rock of ages, and the gates of hell &s;hall not prevail again&s;t it. <HI>When the enemy
<PB N="58" REF="035738_0058_10064FBC5E2EAF40">
&s;hall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the</HI> LORD <HI>&s;hall lift up a &s;tandard again&s;t him.</HI> The time, yea, the &s;et time to favour Zion will come. GOD will ha&s;ten it in his own good time. Though it tarry, wait for it. He will ari&s;e: his enemies &s;hall be &s;cattered; and he will have mercy upon Zion. He will appear in his glory, and build her up. He will beautify her with &s;alvation. He will cau&s;e her to look forth as the morning: fair as the moon, clear as the &s;un, and terrible as an army with ban|ners. The righteou&s;ne&s;s thereof &s;hall go forth as brightne&s;s, and the &s;alvation thereof as a lamp that burneth.</P>
<P>The Jews were once the peculiar people of GOD. He had cho&s;en them for him&s;elf, from among all the families of the earth. He had redeemed them from their Egyptian bondage. He had borne them as on the wings of an eagle, and guarded them as the apple of the eye. He had nouri&s;hed and brought them up as children. He had di&s;tingui&s;hed them by ble&s;&s;ings, both temporal and &s;piritual, above all the nations of the earth. But having been always a &s;tiff-necked and rebellious people; having often provoked the LORD to anger; and having, at length, completed the mea&s;ure of their iniquity by the crucifixion of the Son of GOD, the Prince of life and the Lord of glory, and the rejection of his go&s;pel, GOD ca&s;t them
<PB N="59" REF="035738_0059_10064FBE5B304420">
off. They were given over to a &s;pirit of blind|ne&s;s, impenitency, and unbelief. Their city and temple were de&s;troyed. They were di&s;|per&s;ed over the face of the whole earth; and remain to the pre&s;ent day a per&s;ecuted and de|&s;pi&s;ed people.</P>
<P>As, however, the rejection of the Jews was not total; &s;o, neither will it be final. GOD will yet remember them with covenant mercy. Though it is now near eighteen hundred years &s;ince their rejection and di&s;per&s;ion, they &s;till remain a di&s;tinct people, and &s;eparated from all others: an in&s;tance the like to which has never been known in the world; and a &s;trong pre&s;umptive evidence of GOD's &s;pecial gracious purpo&s;es re&s;pecting them. GOD has mercy in &s;tore for them, which &s;hall, in due time, be di&s;|played towards them, in rich abundance.</P>
<P>This prophetic vi&s;ion then may be ju&s;tly con&s;idered as emblematical, and predictive of their recovery. To me it appears probable, from the tenor of &s;cripture prophecy, that they will be re&s;tored again to their own land; and that, even in a literal &s;en&s;e, Jeru&s;alem &s;hall be|come a peaceable habitation.</P>
<P>Be this, however, as it may, certain it is, that the time is coming when that vail of ignorance and prejudice which has for &s;o many centuries
<PB N="60" REF="035738_0060_10064FC3CAD75848">
been upon their minds, &s;hall be rent; and when, as a people, they &s;hall be brought to know, and to confe&s;s that this JESUS, whom we wor&s;hip, whom they took, and with wicked hands crucified and &s;lew, on Mount Calvary, without the gates of Jeru&s;alem, is, indeed, the true and promi&s;ed MESSIAH: that in him there is a full accompli&s;hment of all the pre|dictions and promi&s;es re&s;pecting the &s;eed of the woman, contained in the Old Te&s;tament, and that he is the truth and &s;ub&s;tance of the whole ceremonial law. And if, as the Apo&s;tle argues, in the eleventh chapter of his epi&s;tle to the Romans, through their fall &s;alvation came to the Gentiles, and the diminution of them be the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulne&s;s? <HI>For if the ca&s;ting away of them be the reconciling of the world; what &s;hall the re|ceiving of them be, but life from the dead.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. This prophetic exhibition ju&s;tly admits of a particular application to the immediate oc|ca&s;ion of our pre&s;ent meeting. We are engaged in an attempt to propagate the go&s;pel among the Indian tribes upon our frontiers. Realize, for a moment, their &s;ituation, and the difficul|ties and di&s;couragements with which we have to contend. You will find them as unfit ma|terials, for the object contemplated, as the dry bones in the valley of vi&s;ion to con&s;titute an army of living men. Be&s;ides that depravity
<PB N="61" REF="035738_0061_10064FC556721BE8">
which is common to human nature; ignorant, uncivilized and &s;avage. Roaming abroad in que&s;t of their prey like the wild bea&s;ts of the fore&s;t. And, alas! that there is rea&s;on to add, corrupted, and their prejudices &s;trongly excited again&s;t Chri&s;tianity, by the &s;till greater depra|vity and wickedne&s;s of a large proportion of tho&s;e, from among our&s;elves, with whom they have had intercour&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Can the&s;e dry bones live?</HI> Can the&s;e &s;avages of the wilderne&s;s become Chri&s;tians? How &s;hall their roving minds be fixed? How &s;hall they be brought to realize and lay to heart their mi&s;ery and danger? How &s;hall they be brought to apprehend, and embrace the re|medy?</P>
<P><HI>O</HI> LORD GOD, <HI>thou knowe&s;t.</HI> We believe it our duty to make the attempt. We believe, and are fully per&s;uaded that thou art able to render it &s;ucce&s;sful. Whether thou wilt, or not, belongs not to us to determine. In the name of our GOD would we &s;et up our ban|ners. Confiding in thy purpo&s;es, power, and grace, would we pro&s;ecute this important un|dertaking. Ha&s;t thou not promi&s;ed to give unto JESUS, thy Son, the heathen for his in|heritance, and the uttermo&s;t parts of the earth for his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Ha&s;t thou not &s;aid, <HI>It is a light thing that thou &s;houlde&s;t be my &s;ervant to
<PB N="62" REF="035738_0062_10064FC701B67DE8">
rai&s;e up the tribes of Jacob, and to re&s;tore the pre&s;erved of I&s;rael&punc; I will al&s;o give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou maye&s;t be my &s;al|vation unto the end of the earth.</HI></P>
<P>Nor, my brethren, are we without con&s;idera|ble grounds of encouragement in our pre&s;ent undertaking. Several concurring circum&s;tances tend to excite our exertions, and to animate our hopes. Has not GOD promi&s;ed, <HI>The wil|derne&s;s, and the &s;olitary places &s;hall be glad for them: and the de&s;ert &s;hall rejoice, and blo&s;&s;om as the ro&s;e. It &s;hall blo&s;&s;om abundantly, and re|joice even with joy and &s;inging; the glory of Le|banon &s;hall be given unto it, the excellency of Carmel and Sharon: they &s;hall &s;ee the glory of the</HI> LORD, <HI>and the excellency of our</HI> GOD. <HI>The kings of Tar&s;hi&s;h and the I&s;les &s;hall bring pre|&s;ents; the kings of Sheba and Seba &s;hall offer gifts. Princes &s;hall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia &s;hall &s;oon &s;tretch out her hands unto</HI> GOD.</P>
<P>The&s;e promi&s;es are in them&s;elves, a &s;ufficient foundation for faith and hope, and for the mo&s;t vigorous exertions. But the providences of GOD, at pre&s;ent, in a particular manner, con|cur with his promi&s;es, and afford ground to hope that their accompli&s;hment draws nigh. Amid&s;t the tumults and confu&s;ions of war, a mi&s;&s;ionary &s;pirit has been poured out in the European world, e&s;pecially in Great-Britain.
<PB N="63" REF="035738_0063_10064FC88C751258">
Regardle&s;s of party names and di&s;tinctions, the friends to the great doctrines of grace have united, as with one heart, and formed &s;ocieties, in various parts, for propagating the go&s;pel among the heathen. Nine and twenty mi&s;&s;ion|aries, &s;ent out by the &s;ociety in London, in a ve&s;&s;el of their own, procured for the purpo&s;e, have arrived &s;afe in the I&s;lands of the South Sea. Six others, namely, two from the Lon|don, two from the Edinburgh, and two from the Gla&s;gow &s;ocieties have been &s;ent to Sierra Leone, in Africa. Be&s;ides tho&s;e which have been &s;ent, or are about to be &s;ent to the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Indies, and to other parts. Add to this that whil&s;t a general and vigorous exertion has been made for evangelizing the heathen, a remarkable zeal has di&s;covered it&s;elf, and extra|ordinary mea&s;ures have been adopted for pro|moting the intere&s;ts of religion at home&punc; by the e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;chools, and &s;ending out itinerant preachers to tho&s;e parts which were de&s;titute of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>Societies in&s;tituted upon the &s;ame principles, and with the &s;ame objects in view, have been formed in America. The &s;ociety, e&s;tabli&s;hed in this city, has procured, and &s;ent out one mi&s;&s;ionary. His de&s;tination is to the Chicka&s;aw Indians on the we&s;tern parts of the &s;tate of Georgia. Probably by this time he has nearly arrived at the end of his journey. He has gone
<PB N="64" REF="035738_0064_10064FCB4FCF3208">
forth under the mo&s;t promi&s;ing au&s;pices. Chri&s;|tian liberality has hitherto furni&s;hed us with pecuniary re&s;ources adequate to our exigencies; and &s;hould the undertaking &s;ucceed, we have no rea&s;on to doubt but that we &s;hall &s;till obtain a &s;ufficiency to &s;erve our purpo&s;es. Our great|e&s;t pre&s;ent want is, at lea&s;t, another mi&s;&s;ionary. May the LORD put it into the hearts of &s;ome to offer them&s;elves, who &s;hall be found quali|fied for the work, and who&s;e labours he will crown with abundant &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>In the IVth and la&s;t place. This prophetic vi&s;ion may be con&s;idered as a lively emblema|tical repre&s;entation of the re&s;urrection of the dead at the la&s;t day. The doctrine of a re&s;ur|rection was denied by the Sadducees, and ridi|culed by the heathen philo&s;ophers. But it has always been an object of faith and hope to the church and people of God. The difficulties which &s;tand in the way of a re&s;urrection are, in the eye of &s;en&s;e and rea&s;on, in&s;uperable. Hence, though the heathen philo&s;ophers had &s;ome apprehen&s;ions of the immortality of the &s;oul, yet they had no idea of the re&s;urrection of the body. Accordingly, when the apo&s;tle Paul, in his &s;peech at Athens, made mention of a re&s;urrection, <HI>&s;ome mocked, others &s;aid, we will hear thee again of this matter.</HI></P>
<P>Lift up your eyes upon the congregation of
<PB N="65" REF="035738_0065_10064FCDF21C56B0">
the dead. Are they not very many, and very dry? Survey the number of Adam's family who, &s;ince the fir&s;t commencement of time, have fallen under the &s;troke of the King of terrors, and become the prey of corruption and worms. What mu&s;t be the condition of tho&s;e who have now been in this &s;ituation for hun|dreds, nay, for thou&s;ands of years? What is become of the con&s;tituent parts of tho&s;e bodies which have, &s;o long &s;ince, returned to their native du&s;t? Some have been depo&s;ited in &s;epulchres, and become incorporated with their mother earth. Some have been con&s;umed by fire, and their a&s;hes &s;cattered by the winds to the four corners of the earth. Some have been ca&s;t into the &s;ea, and devoured by the fi&s;hes, or &s;unk down into the depths of the ocean, under the load of mighty waters. And &s;ome have become the prey of the fowls of the air, and of the bea&s;ts of the field. The rich and the poor, the honoured and the de&s;pi&s;ed, the learned and the illiterate, the ma&s;ter and the &s;ervant, the tyrant and the &s;lave, the king and the beggar, have, long &s;ince, been blended to|gether in one promi&s;cuous heap. <HI>Can the&s;e bones live?</HI> How &s;hall the&s;e particles be col|lected and again formed into tho&s;e bodies of which they were once con&s;tituent parts?</P>
<P>Rea&s;oning in the line of analogy, the fre|quent re&s;urrections which take place, both in
<PB N="66" REF="035738_0066_10064FCFF4FC8F58">
the animal and vegetable world, would &s;eem to afford &s;ome pre&s;umptive evidence of a re|&s;urrection of the human body. Any conclu|&s;ions, however, which could be drawn from the&s;e, would be extremely vague and uncertain. Ble&s;&s;ed be GOD we have a more &s;ure founda|tion on which our faith and hope of this im|portant article re&s;ts. Life and immortality have been brought to light by the go&s;pel. The certainty of a re&s;urrection re&s;ts upon two prin|ciples, namely, the purpo&s;e, and the power of GOD. To the&s;e two is it referred by our LORD in his reply to the Sadducees. <HI>Ye do err, not knowing the &s;criptures, nor the power of</HI> GOD; <HI>the &s;criptures,</HI> which declare that there &s;hall be a re&s;urrection; and <HI>the power of</HI> GOD, which is able to effect it.</P>
<P>That GOD is able to rai&s;e the dead cannot be que&s;tioned: for what cannot Omnipotence do? <HI>He calls tho&s;e things which are not, as though they were.</HI> He made all things, at fir&s;t, out of nothing. He is the former of the bodies, and the father of the &s;pirits of all fle&s;h. If then GOD made the human body out of the du&s;t of the earth, and breathed into it the breath of life, &s;o that man became a living &s;oul; tell me, ye infidels, is he not able to rai&s;e this body again from the du&s;t of the earth, and to re-e&s;tabli&s;h that union between it and the &s;oul which had been de&s;troyed by death?</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="035738_0067_10064FD18AEA8288">That GOD will rai&s;e the dead is evident from &s;cripture te&s;timony. I &s;hall re&s;t this on the three following pa&s;&s;ages. The fir&s;t you have Job xix. 25, 26 and 27. <HI>For I know that my</HI> REDEEMER <HI>liveth, and that he &s;hall &s;tand at the latter day upon the earth. And though, after my &s;kin, worms de&s;troy this body, yet in my fle&s;h &s;hall I &s;ee</HI> GOD. <HI>Whom I &s;hall &s;ee for my&s;elf, and mine eyes &s;hall behold, and not another, though my reins be con&s;umed within me.</HI> The &s;econd pa&s;&s;age you have, I&s;aiah xxvi. 19. <HI>Thy dead men &s;hall live, together with my dead body &s;hall they ari&s;e. Awake and &s;ing, ye that dwell in the du&s;t: for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth &s;hall ca&s;t out the dead.</HI> The third pa&s;&s;age, to which I referred, is in John v. 28 and 29. <HI>Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming in the which all that are in the grave &s;hall hear the voice of the Son of</HI> GOD. <HI>And &s;hall come forth, they that have done good, unto the re&s;urrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the re&s;urrection of damnation.</HI></P>
<P>Of this re&s;urrection that which was exhibited to the imagination of the Prophet was but a &s;mall repre&s;entation. O the noi&s;e and the &s;haking when atom &s;hall come together to his atom, and bone to his bone of all who &s;hall be numbered with the &s;ilent dead! How va&s;t the multitude, how crowded the throng, when the &s;ea &s;hall give up the dead which are in it, and
<PB N="68" REF="035738_0068_10064FD5ED823138">
death and hell &s;hall give up the dead which are in them; and the dead, &s;mall and great &s;hall &s;tand before GOD! There, my brethren, &s;hall you and I appear, though, probably, long before that period arrive, we &s;hall have gone the way of all fle&s;h, and our bodies have taken up their re&s;idence in the grave; the hou&s;e ap|pointed for all the living.</P>
<P>We can only, briefly, hint at the various things which pre&s;ent them&s;elves in the applica|tion of this &s;ubject. It addre&s;&s;es it&s;elf to per|&s;ons of every de&s;cription and character; and calls for their &s;pecial improvement.</P>
<P>Such as are the &s;ubjects of a new and divine life, may learn from hence the obligations which they are under to the mercy and grace of GOD. Once you were in a &s;tate of &s;piritual death, hopele&s;s and helple&s;s, as the dry bones in the valley of vi&s;ion. When a&s;leep in &s;ecurity, and dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins, GOD awakened you, and &s;aid unto you, live. Through the effectual operations of his &s;pirit and grace, you have pa&s;&s;ed from death unto life, and from the power of Satan to &s;erve the living GOD. Your lives are bid with CHRIST in GOD, and you are heirs of that eternal life which GOD, who cannot lie, hath promi&s;ed to tho&s;e that are his. You have abundant matter for the exerci&s;e of faith and hope, and many powerful excitements
<PB N="69" REF="035738_0069_10064FD774CAEC50">
to the duties of thank&s;giving and prai&s;e. GOD will never leave you, nor for&s;ake you. That grace which has been implanted in you &s;hall be perfected in glory, and, in due time, you &s;hall receive the end of your faith in the &s;alvation of your &s;ouls. Your fle&s;h al&s;o &s;hall re&s;t in hope, and you may cheerfully re&s;ign your bodies to death and the grave in the &s;ure and certain pro&s;pect of a glorious re&s;urrection to an im|mortal life.</P>
<P N="2">2. This &s;ubject &s;peaks encouragement to &s;uch as are, in any mea&s;ure, awakened to a &s;en&s;e of their mi&s;ery and danger, and are in|quiring what they &s;hall do to be &s;aved. GOD has cau&s;ed this noi&s;e and &s;haking. It is a token for good. This is a precious, and, O remem|ber, it is a perilous &s;ea&s;on. Take care to im|prove it. Your eternal all is at ri&s;k upon it. Re&s;i&s;t not the grace which may be exerted to|wards you. Provoke not the life-giving &s;pirit of GOD to depart from you. Ha&s;ten to the Saviour, and to the arms of mercy which are open to receive you. <HI>When thou heare&s;t the &s;ound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees, then be&s;tir thy&s;elf: for then &s;hall the</HI> LORD <HI>go out before thee to &s;mite thine enemies.</HI> But if this &s;ea&s;on is &s;uffered to pa&s;s unim|proved, the like of it may never return, and you may be left to complain, <HI>The harve&s;t is pa&s;t, the &s;ummer is ended, and we are not &s;aved.
<PB N="70" REF="035738_0070_10064FD901CF41C0">
Work out your own &s;alvation,</HI> then, <HI>with fear and trembling. For it is</HI> GOD <HI>which worketh in you, both to will and to do of his good plea&s;ure. Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon the&s;e &s;lain that they may live.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. What has been &s;aid affords encourage|ment to diligence in the u&s;e of tho&s;e means which GOD has in&s;tituted for the conver&s;ion and &s;alvation of &s;inners. When we con&s;ider the utterly ruined and helple&s;s &s;tate of the &s;inner in him&s;elf, and our in&s;ufficiency to do any thing effectual for his recovery, our hearts are ready to &s;ink under di&s;couragements, and our hands to hang down. And when we con|&s;ider the many fruitle&s;s attempts which have been made, we are ready to de&s;pond, and to de&s;i&s;t from any farther endeavours. But when we realize that GOD who has appointed the&s;e means both can, and will render them effectual for accompli&s;hing the de&s;igns of his grace we take hope, and are encouraged to renew our exertions. It becomes not us to cavil; but with the Prophet to obey. He knew not whe|ther the dry bones, to which he was command|ed to prophe&s;y, &s;hould live or not. This he knew depended entirely upon the purpo&s;e and power of GOD. But, in obedience to the di|vine command, he prophe&s;ied upon them, and called upon them to hear the word of the LORD. And as he prophe&s;ied, behold, there
<PB N="71" REF="035738_0071_10064FDADEB4CF30">
was a noi&s;e and a &s;haking; and as he prophe&s;ied they lived and &s;tood up. GOD has bound us to the u&s;e of the means; and, ble&s;&s;ed be his name, he will put an honour on his own in&s;ti|tutions. What was the me&s;&s;age which the Pro|phet was to deliver to the&s;e dry bones? It was, <HI>Behold, I will cau&s;e breath to enter into you, and ye &s;hall live.</HI> Let us never de&s;pair then, nor be di&s;couraged in the u&s;e of the means whil&s;t GOD is mighty to &s;ave.</P>
<P>Suffer me then, in the 4th place, in con|fidence of the power and grace of GOD, to render what may be &s;aid effectual, to call upon every &s;inner in this a&s;&s;embly to hear and obey the go&s;pel me&s;&s;age. <HI>Awake, thou that &s;leepe&s;t, and ari&s;e from the dead, and</HI> CHRIST <HI>&s;hall give thee light. What meane&s;t thou, O &s;leeper, ari&s;e, call upon thy</HI> GOD, <HI>if &s;o be that</HI> GOD <HI>will think upon</HI> thee <HI>that</HI> thou <HI>peri&s;h not. Repent, and be converted that your &s;ins may be blotted out. Believe in the</HI> LORD JESUS CHRIST, <HI>and thou &s;halt be &s;aved. Make you a new heart, and a new &s;pirit, for why will ye die.</HI> Let no diffi|culties nor di&s;couragements deter you from making the attempt, and per&s;i&s;ting in your ex|ertions until you &s;ucceed. Unle&s;s you &s;ucceed you are undone for ever. He who called La|zarus from the tomb, can equally call you from the death of &s;in to a life of holine&s;s. Behold! the grace of the REDEEMER is infinite, and
<PB N="72" REF="035738_0072_10064FDEB8998850">
it is freely tendered unto you. Behold! all the horrors of eternal death, on the one hand, to alarm and drive; and all the glory and joys of heaven, on the other, to allure and draw you. Up then, and be doing. Who knows what mercy and grace may be in &s;tore for you. <HI>Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no phy|&s;ician there?</HI> Yes; there is a Phy&s;ician, who is perfectly acquainted with every ca&s;e; and a Balm that is a &s;overeign remedy for every di&s;|ea&s;e. <HI>Why then is not the health of the daughter of my people re&s;tored?</HI> It is not owing to any want of power or grace, in the glorious RE|DEEMER, that any pine away, and die with their tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and their &s;ins upon them. <HI>As I live, &s;aith the</HI> LORD GOD, <HI>I have no plea|&s;ure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live.</HI> But it is owing to their own perver&s;ene&s;s and wilful ob&s;tinacy. They hold fa&s;t their iniquities and will not let them go. <HI>And ye will not come to me that ye might have life.</HI> Perhaps the poor &s;avage of the wilderne&s;s may welcome tho&s;e me&s;&s;ages of grace which you reject and de&s;pi&s;e. Perhaps, alarming and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing thought! perhaps, the di&s;tingui&s;hing ble&s;&s;ings and privileges of the go&s;pel may be taken away from tho&s;e who &s;o greatly undervalue, and mi&s;improve them, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="035738_0073_10064FE046CAB560">In the 5th and la&s;t place. I would improve what has been &s;aid by exhorting all to the mo&s;t vigorous exertions in promoting the cau&s;e and intere&s;t of the REDEEMER in the world. It is a glorious cau&s;e, and &s;hall finally prevail and triumph over all oppo&s;ition. Mo&s;t of you may contribute to its promotion in various ways: by your in&s;tructions, by your advice, by your contributions, and by your example. But there is one mo&s;t effectual way in which all may con|tribute: I mean, by their prayers. Let all then be excited to frequency, fervency and impor|tunity in this duty. Ye that fear the LORD, give him no re&s;t until he e&s;tabli&s;h Jeru&s;alem, and make her a name and a prai&s;e in the earth. Our LORD &s;pake the parable of the unju&s;t judge and the importunate widow to teach us that we ought always to pray, and not to faint. <HI>The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man, availeth much.</HI> GOD has promi&s;ed to do mar|vellous things in righteou&s;ne&s;s for his Church and people: But he has declared, I will yet be inquired of, by the hou&s;e of I&s;rael to do it for them. Were there many &s;tirred up to wre&s;tle with GOD in prayer, in behalf of his Church, there would be ground to hope that the &s;et time to favour Zion was come, and our eyes might yet &s;ee glorious days of the Son of man.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>REVEREND AND DEAR BROTHER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE character in which you &s;tand before this a&s;&s;embly is highly important, and pe|culiarly intere&s;ting, to all who regard the &s;ouls of men, and the pro&s;perity of the Redeemer's kingdom.&mdash;You &s;tand here as the fir&s;t me&s;&s;en|ger employed by the New-York Mi&s;&s;ionary Society, to carry the glad tidings of &s;alvation to the heathen on our borders, who are <HI>peri&s;hing for lack of knowledge.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="035738_0076_10064FE80D224630">You have the honour to be the fir&s;t in en|tering upon tho&s;e labours which the liberality of our Chri&s;tian brethren has enabled us to commence, and to which we hope others, pro|vided by the great Lord of the harve&s;t, will &s;oon follow you. Every pious heart within the&s;e walls feels a tender intere&s;t in your un|dertaking, and beats high with anxious hope for the re&s;ult of your mi&s;&s;ion!</P>
<P>You are entering upon a new and untried &s;cene of labour. Though you have been for &s;ome years clothed with the honourable cha|racter of an amba&s;&s;ador of Chri&s;t, you cannot but be &s;en&s;ible, that the field of mini&s;terial ex|ertion to which you are ha&s;tening, is widely different from that to which you have been hi|therto accu&s;tomed. You are going to a region which the joyful &s;ound of the go&s;pel has never yet reached&mdash;to a howling wilderne&s;s, where the arts of civilized life are almo&s;t unknown&mdash; to a people covered with the gloom of igno|rance, &s;uper&s;tition and barbari&s;m. You are about to take upon your&s;elf the mighty ta&s;k of proclaiming the good news of &s;alvation through a crucified Saviour, to tho&s;e who never heard of his name, and of carrying the light of the Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s to tho&s;e who are &s;itting in the region and &s;hadow of death. Who can tell the con&s;equences of this &s;olemn undertak|ing! Who can calculate how deeply the glory
<PB N="77" REF="035738_0077_10064FE995401810">
of God&mdash;the intere&s;t of the Redeemer's king|dom&mdash;and the &s;alvation of millions yet unborn, may be involved in this mi&s;&s;ion!</P>
<P>Permit me, therefore, my dear brother, be|fore we bid you adieu, permit me with all plainne&s;s and affection, in the name of the &s;o|ciety to which you are engaged, to offer you a few words of parting coun&s;el, and to commend you by prayer to the great Head of the Church.</P>
<P>And in the fir&s;t place, Let me entreat you to maintain an holy jealou&s;y, and an unremitted watchfulne&s;s over your own heart. This is of the utmo&s;t importance, whether you regard your comfort or your u&s;efulne&s;s. Irk&s;ome in|deed will the labours of the wilderne&s;s be, un|le&s;s you have grace in lively exerci&s;e&mdash;unle&s;s you are habitually animated by ardent love to Chri&s;t, and by a tender concern for precious and immortal &s;ouls. Nor can it be rea&s;onably expected, that the duties of your mi&s;&s;ion will be di&s;charged with &s;uch diligence and zeal, as to promi&s;e much &s;ucce&s;s, unle&s;s you are careful to keep alive in your own brea&s;t, a deep &s;en&s;e of the importance of the tru&s;t committed to you; and unle&s;s an holy ambition to advance your Ma&s;ter's kingdom, fire your bo&s;om, and daily &s;tir up the energies of your &s;oul. And here, let me remind you, dear Sir, that the circum&s;tance of your being far removed from your brethren

in the mini&s;try, and from the Chri&s;tian &s;ociety which you have hitherto enjoyed, will render peculiar attention to this point nece&s;&s;ary. You have been accu&s;tomed to the animating conver|&s;ation, and the con&s;oling intercour&s;e, of Chri&s;|tian friends: But in the di&s;tant region to which you are going, you will be in a great mea&s;ure cut off from the&s;e &s;ources of improvement and con&s;olation. The mo&s;t you can expect from the objects of your mi&s;&s;ion, will be the kind|ne&s;s of &s;avage barbari&s;m, and occa&s;ional mini|&s;trations to the wants of your body; you can expect to find no &s;piritual helpers among them &mdash;no gracious hearts that will an&s;wer to your own, as <HI>face an&s;wereth to face in a gla&s;s.</HI> In this &s;ituation it will be your intere&s;t and your duty to be more than ordinarily engaged in communing with God, and with your own heart&mdash;See that proper motives animate all your exertions, and direct all your labours &mdash;Guard equally again&s;t that &s;elfi&s;h ambition which may lead you a&s;tray, and that criminal &s;loth which will tempt you to &s;hrink from the toils of your important emba&s;&s;y. Make it your daily &s;tudy to live near to God, and to <HI>endure as &s;eeing him who is invi&s;ible. Watch and pray that you enter not into temptation.</HI> Seek after a continual increa&s;e of that <HI>precious faith</HI> which rai&s;es the &s;oul more and more above the vani|ties and the difficulties of this world&mdash;Study to grow in that holy love which <HI>hopeth all things,

believeth all things, and</HI> ENDURETH <HI>all things. Grow in grace, and in the knowledge of your Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> Thus may you expect to perform your arduous labours with comfort to your&s;elf, and with u&s;efulne&s;s to the &s;ouls of men.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd place, While you exerci&s;e a &s;olicitous care over your own heart, &s;tudy to deliver to the poor heathen the plain, genuine and unadorned go&s;pel of Chri&s;t. We charge you before God, that you <HI>know nothing among them, &s;ave Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and him crucified.</HI> Ne|ver &s;uffer your&s;elf to &s;ub&s;titute human devices for the &s;implicity of evangelical truth. Believe it, my brother, if ever you &s;ucceed in convert|ing the heathen from &s;in to holine&s;s, and from Satan to the living God, it mu&s;t be by the <HI>pure go&s;pel of the Saviour.</HI> This is the <HI>&s;harp two-edged &s;word, which pierceth even to the di|viding a&s;under of &s;oul and &s;pirit, and of the joints and marrow; and which di&s;cerneth the thoughts and intents of the heart.</HI> This is <HI>the weapon which is mighty through God to the pul|ling down of &s;trong holds, and which bringeth every thought into captivity to the obedience of Chri&s;t.</HI> Diligently endeavour, then, in your public preaching, and in your private confe|rences, to impre&s;s upon their rude minds, that <HI>all have &s;inned and come &s;hort of the glory of God&mdash;that by the works of the law no fle&s;h living
<PB N="80" REF="035738_0080_10064FF1C371C660">
can be ju&s;tified&mdash;that &s;inners are ju&s;tified, freely by God's grace, through the redemption that is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us</HI>&mdash;and that <HI>his blood clean&s;eth from all &s;in.</HI> Do not wa&s;te your time <HI>in doting about que&s;tions and &s;trifes of words;</HI> or in di&s;|cu&s;&s;ing the &s;ubtilties of polemic divinity. Do not imagine that you will be able to remove all the objections which the carnal mind may make to evangelical truth; and therefore do not dwell on the&s;e, but rather imitate the con|duct of the apo&s;tles, who in&s;i&s;t much on the fall and depravity of man; on the incarnation, the humiliation, the atonement, and the glory of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Endeavour often to give &s;im|ple and affecting recitals of his love, his &s;uf|ferings, his death, his re&s;urrection and his a&s;|cen&s;ion to glory; and the obligations we are under to the un&s;earchable riches of his grace. &mdash;Take every opportunity of impre&s;&s;ing the&s;e truths on their minds; deliver them with plain|ne&s;s, with pungency and with affection&mdash;<HI>not in the enticing words of man's wi&s;dom, but in de|mon&s;tration of the &s;pirit and of power.</HI>&mdash;And for this purpo&s;e, let the &s;criptures of truth be your daily &s;tudy, and the great &s;tandard of your preaching. This &s;acred volume contains at once your commi&s;&s;ion and your in&s;tructions&mdash; Keeping clo&s;e to this, as the rule of your mini|&s;try, and living near to the Lord Je&s;us, as the Captain of your &s;alvation, you may &s;afely tru&s;t him for the fruits of all your labours.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="035738_0081_10064FF3501E6378">Once more, Let your example among the heathen corre&s;pond with your preaching&mdash;let your conver&s;ation be a living comment on the pure go&s;pel, which you recommend to them&mdash; te&s;tify to them every day, that the religion which you preach has its proper effect on your own heart and life&mdash;and that you are by grace your&s;elf what you would per&s;uade them to be. If they &s;ee you violating tho&s;e precepts of up|rightne&s;s, temperance, purity and univer&s;al ho|line&s;s, which you will of cour&s;e deliver to them, it will di&s;grace your character and de&s;troy your u&s;efulne&s;s. An immoral mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel is every where an odious and a mi&s;chievous character; but an immoral <HI>mi&s;&s;ionary,</HI> an un|holy me&s;&s;enger of &s;alvation to the benighted heathen, is peculiarly odious, and is likely to be an hundred fold more mi&s;chievous: For while the uncultivated &s;avage is oftentimes &s;hrewd and di&s;cerning, and is &s;oon &s;hocked with the incon&s;i&s;tency of &s;uch a character, he is deprived of tho&s;e advantages, which, if en|joyed, might take away in &s;ome mea&s;ure the force of &s;uch fatal example&mdash;and thus he is left to all its de&s;tructive influence&mdash;and is hereby tempted to loathe and &s;hun a religion which has &s;uch profe&s;&s;ors. Be careful, then, to walk worthy of your high calling, in all lowline&s;s and meekne&s;s&mdash;letting <HI>your light &s;o &s;hine before the heathen, that they may &s;ee your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="035738_0082_10064FF4F4A4F590">And here I would, in an e&s;pecial manner, enjoin it upon you, to exhibit to the &s;avage tribes among whom you may labour, upon all occa&s;ions, that frank, open and di&s;intere&s;ted character, that is always impre&s;&s;ive, even on the minds of barbarians. Never give them cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect you of mercenary motives, or of hidden and di&s;ingenuous de&s;igns. All expe|rience proves that the moment any thing of this kind is di&s;covered, your influence will be at an end. Let your diligence, your zeal, your &s;elf-denial and mortification to the world, convince them, that you <HI>&s;eek not</HI> THEIRS, <HI>but</HI> THEM&mdash; that the governing end of all your labours is to promote their temporal and eternal happi|ne&s;s. Accommodate your&s;elf, as far as the purity of the go&s;pel will admit, to their cu&s;|toms and their prejudices&mdash;and let your apo&s;|tolic zeal be tempered with that apo&s;tolic pru|dence, which <HI>became all things to all men, that he might gain &s;ome. Be wi&s;e as a &s;erpent and harmle&s;s as a dove.</HI></P>
<P>In a word, my dear brother, you have every rea&s;on to expect that you will meet with many trials, and even formidable difficulties. You will have to contend with the perils of the wil|derne&s;s, and with the numerous inconveniencies of barbarous life. You will have to encounter the ob&s;tacles ari&s;ing from the ferocious temper, the roving di&s;po&s;ition, the &s;uper&s;titious preju|dices,

and the profound ignorance of the hea|then tribes, to which you are going. In ad|dition to the numerous di&s;couragements which ordinarily be&s;et the amba&s;&s;ador of Chri&s;t, you will have many peculiar to your &s;ituation as a mi&s;&s;ionary among the heathen. The&s;e are con|&s;iderations which, were there nothing to counter|balance them, would appal the &s;toute&s;t heart.</P>
<P><HI>But let none of the&s;e things move you.</HI> Re|member the divine commi&s;&s;ion, <HI>Go ye into all the world and preach the go&s;pel to every creature.</HI> And remember the gracious promi&s;e with which it was accompanied&mdash;"<HI>Lo I am with you alway even unto the end of the world.</HI>" Go in the name and in the &s;trength, therefore, of the mighty God of Jacob! <HI>Endure hardne&s;s as a good &s;oldier of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.

<HEAD>INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE DIRECTORS OF THE NEW-YORK MISSIONARY SOCIETY, TO THEIR MISSIONARIES among the INDIANS.</HEAD>
<P>IN this early &s;tage of the mi&s;&s;ion, very particular in&s;tructions cannot be expected. You will be furni&s;hed with them from time to time, according to the circum&s;tances which ari&s;e; and &s;omething mu&s;t ever be left to your own prudence. There are, however, certain in&s;tructions which will apply at all times and in all circum&s;tances, and by which you are, invariably, to guide your&s;elves. The&s;e re&s;pect chiefly, I. Your per&s;onal religion. II. The matter and manner of your teaching. III. Your outward deportment. IV. The formation of re|ligious a&s;&s;emblies, and the admini&s;tration of ordi|nances. V. The e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;chools for chil|dren. VI. Ob&s;ervations on the language and cu&s;toms of the Indians; and on the pro&s;pects of making &s;ettlements, and extending the go&s;pel among them.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>Your per&s;onal religion.</HI> No words can expre&s;s the importance of this, and urge it with &s;ufficient warmth. Your comfort and &s;ucce&s;s in your work depend upon it. Without it, the fine&s;t genius,
<PB N="86" REF="035738_0086_10064FFE495747F8">
the highe&s;t literary acquirements and the greate&s;t eloquence will be unavailing. By this we mean not only that your hope of an intere&s;t in the Saviour be well founded, but that you con&s;tantly &s;trive to maintain the power of religion in your hearts; that you live near to God; giving your&s;elves much to &s;olemn meditation and prayer. As you need in your difficult and perilous &s;ituation, uncommon love to God, zeal for his glory, and communications of divine wi&s;dom and &s;trength, &s;o you &s;hould habitual|ly &s;eek the&s;e, in the full a&s;&s;urance of faith that they will be afforded. Though what is called o&s;tentation in religion is to be avoided as vile, yet endeavour to live in &s;uch a manner as that tho&s;e who ob&s;erve you may believe you to be holy men, denied to your&s;elves, crucified to this world, and who&s;e conver&s;ation is in heaven.</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>The matter and manner of your teaching.</HI> As to the <HI>matter,</HI> let it be the great and peculiar doc|trines of divine revelation; &s;uch as the &s;in and mi&s;ery of man by the fall; the eternal coun&s;el of God, revealed in time, to &s;ave &s;inners by the &s;ub|&s;titution of his own Son; the incarnation, obedi|ence, &s;ufferings and death of the Son of God, in the room of &s;inners; his re&s;urrection, a&s;cen&s;ion, interce&s;&s;ion in heaven, and the final judgment; the application of the redemption of Chri&s;t by the Holy Spirit, and the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of his agen|cy to change the hearts of men, and bring them to holine&s;s and happine&s;s. The confe&s;&s;ion of faith contained in the con&s;titution of the Society, is to be the confe&s;&s;ion of your faith, and your teaching is to be conformable thereto. We believe that the&s;e doctrines are appointed by God, and found in ex|perience to be the only and effectual means of &s;a|vingly
<PB N="78" REF="035738_0078_10064FEB20E9B478">
impre&s;&s;ing the minds of men, reforming their lives, and turning them to holine&s;s.</P>
<P>We warn, yea, we charge you, our beloved brethren, again&s;t &s;etting up your own wi&s;dom; again&s;t preaching natural religion di&s;tinct from re|vealed; again&s;t founding moral conduct on any other principle than the grace of God. We enjoin you to declare, as your hearers are prepared to re|ceive it, <HI>the whole coun&s;el of God;</HI> and to remember in all your mini&s;trations, that <HI>Chri&s;t crucified is unto them which are called, the power of God, and the wi&s;dom of God.</HI> We would enforce what we &s;ay on this particular by quoting part of the in&s;tructions given to the Mi&s;&s;ionaries to the I&s;lands of the South-Sea.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Coun&s;els and in&s;tructions for the regulation of the Mi&s;&s;ion, by the Directors of the London Mi&s;&s;ionary So|ciety.</NOTE> "The bible, and the experience of the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful mi&s;&s;ions, a&s;&s;ure us, that the great doctrine of the Atonement mu&s;t be the chief cor|ner &s;tone. The glory and the humiliation of Je&s;us, and every thing relative to the deliverance from &s;in and death by him mu&s;t make the ground-work. A &s;imple recital of his love, the de&s;ign of his in|carnation, death, and re&s;urrection; the&s;e mu&s;t be the points, chiefly, repeatedly dwelt upon. The obligations of love and duty which we owe him, naturally connect them&s;elves with the&s;e views; to|gether with promi&s;es of his grace, through the agency of his own &s;pirit, to enable us to follow him in the regeneration. Affect not &s;ubtilties and deep points of controver&s;y, either among your&s;elves or with the natives. Wave as much as po&s;&s;ible what would lead to que&s;tions, rather than godly edifying.
<PB N="88" REF="035738_0088_1006500363B046B8">
Attempt not by arguments on the rea&s;onablene&s;s, or evidences of the Chri&s;tian religion, to di&s;play your own wi&s;dom; or &s;uppo&s;e you can an&s;wer and &s;ilence all their objections. Adhere to the &s;im|plicity which is in Chri&s;t, tru&s;ting to the power of the Holy Gho&s;t to take the things of Chri&s;t, and &s;hew them to their con&s;ciences with divine convic|tion and effectual energy."</P>
<P>As to the <HI>manner</HI> of your teaching, let it be &s;uch as is be&s;t adapted to the comprehen&s;ion of your hearers. It mu&s;t needs be, when to the untutored Indian, and when by an interpreter, very plain, in &s;hort &s;entences, and frequently interrupted; par|taking more of the nature of conver&s;ation, than of formal and continued di&s;cour&s;e. This will demand of you much conde&s;cen&s;ion, patience, and forbear|ance. You mu&s;t become children to adapt your|&s;elves to childi&s;h under&s;tandings, and patience mu&s;t have her perfect work, in bearing with ignorance, petulance, and &s;lowne&s;s of apprehen&s;ion. Do not de&s;pond when you &s;ee no immediate fruits of your labours, but wait in humble dependence on the Spirit of God to give efficacy to his word. As the reading of written di&s;cour&s;es will not be nece&s;&s;ary, &s;o we would advi&s;e again&s;t it. Great attention will be required in finding proper interpreters, and it will be de&s;irable, if practicable, that only tho&s;e be employed who are converts to the Chri&s;tian faith. You will take pains to acquire as &s;oon and as much as you can, a knowledge of the Indian language, that &s;o you may not be &s;ubjected to the inconvenience, and, perhaps to the un&s;kilfulne&s;s or unfaithfulne&s;s of interpreters.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="89" REF="035738_0089_1006500607F76208">III. <HI>Your outward deportment.</HI> This is a matter to which we wi&s;h you carefully to attend. You mu&s;t be grave, &s;ober, hone&s;t, cha&s;te, meek, and faithful to your word. The Indians are grave in tran&s;acting all their bu&s;ine&s;s, and they expect the &s;ame in others. They neither admire nor tru&s;t a light and trifling character. They are &s;aid to pay a &s;trict regard to truth. Be not you ha&s;ty in de|claring your intentions, and in making promi&s;es; but when made, let them be faithfully and punc|tually fulfilled. They exhibit on many occa&s;ions acutene&s;s and &s;agacity. They di&s;cern deviations from that natural law which is written in their hearts, and, if they find you defective, it will de|&s;troy their confidence, and prejudice them again&s;t the go&s;pel. The &s;tricte&s;t attention to the&s;e things is the more nece&s;&s;ary, on account of the intercour&s;e which has &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the nations of Indians and &s;ome white people, in which the latter have gro&s;sly deceived and cheated the former, committed crimes not even named among the heathen, and brought an unju&s;t reproach upon the Chri&s;tian pro|fe&s;&s;ion. If you can make the Indians &s;en&s;ible of the difference between nominal and real Chri&s;tians, and the impropriety of judging of Chri&s;tianity by the conduct of &s;ome who never felt its influence, who violate all its precepts, and who are ca&s;t out by real Chri&s;tians as unworthy of communion, a great point would be gained.</P>
<P>We farther in&s;truct you to ab&s;tain from all traffic, all buying and &s;elling of lands, all political di&s;|cu&s;&s;ions, and in one word, from every thing which might excite a &s;u&s;picion that your errand is for any other purpo&s;e, or that you have any other object in view, than, &s;ingly, their &s;piritual and eternal
<PB N="90" REF="035738_0090_10065007A2102760">
welfare. It is of the utmo&s;t importance that you adhere to this line of conduct, and thus impre&s;s the Indians with a conviction of your love to them being great, and not influenced by &s;elfi&s;h con&s;idera|tions. Impo&s;ed upon in times pa&s;t, and awakened by the novelty of your mi&s;&s;ion, they will pry into your motives, and diligently mark your actions. <HI>Put no &s;tumbling-block, or an occa&s;ion to fall in their way.</HI></P>
<P>By denying your&s;elves to &s;trong liquors, you may &s;ave your&s;elves both trouble and blame. It is well known how fond the Indians are of rum, and how pernicious it is to them. Should they &s;ee you in|dulge in the u&s;e, it will whet their de&s;ires, and they will plead your example.</P>
<P>The Mi&s;&s;ionaries of the United Brethren, u&s;ually called Moravians, have never been in the practice of making pre&s;ents to the Indians to gain their fa|vor and protection; nor are they to be encourag|ed to expect any from you. Be&s;ide that pre&s;ents would open the door for an expence which the funds of the Society will not admit, we had rather you &s;hould gain their favor by more &s;ub&s;tantial acts of kindne&s;s; and teach them that they owe di&s;|intere&s;tedne&s;s for your own, in foregoing every earthly advantage and comfort to bring them <HI>the un&s;earchable riches of Chri&s;t.</HI> The Society will make every exertion in their power to promote their knowledge of, and attention to agriculture and the arts of civilized life; but nothing is to be expect|ed for gewgaws and tin&s;el ornaments.</P>
<P>On whatever regards your external accommodation, we can only &s;ay, that it may be nece&s;&s;ary to con|form
<PB N="91" REF="035738_0091_1006500940A8AF98">
to the habits of living among the Indians, &s;o far as is lawful and decent; and, e&s;pecially, that you &s;ubmit to the coar&s;e&s;t fare and the harde&s;t lodging without di&s;&s;atisfaction and complaint. To expect the conveniences of civilized life, would be|tray a want of the mi&s;&s;ionary &s;pirit. The great Apo&s;tle of the Gentiles knew, <HI>both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to &s;uffer need;</HI> and his divine Ma&s;ter, the Lord and Saviour of us all, when he dwelt upon this earth, <HI>had not where to lay his head.</HI></P>
<P>Another thing of great moment in your conduct may be mentioned here, which is, that you &s;hun di&s;&s;en&s;ions among your&s;elves. While you are care|ful not to &s;peak of the divi&s;ions which &s;o &s;hame|fully prevail in the Chri&s;tian world, you &s;hould exhibit in your own &s;ociety true love and concord. Never differ about particular modes and ceremonies of wor&s;hip, or things not e&s;&s;ential; con&s;idering that your work is to win men to Chri&s;t, and not to make pro&s;elytes to any &s;ect or denomination whatever. In ca&s;e of your meeting with Mi&s;&s;ion|aries from other denominations, and of a different faith, you are to &s;hun public di&s;putation with them, and to pur&s;ue, with mildne&s;s, firmne&s;s, and &s;teadi|ne&s;s, your own &s;y&s;tem. The Mi&s;&s;ionaries of the United Brethren, particularly, are entitled to your e&s;teem and confidence, the Lord having honored them in their long and indefatigable labours. We think that a mutual confidence and corre&s;pondence might &s;ub&s;i&s;t; and that, without interfering, you &s;hould provoke each other <HI>unto love, and to good works</HI>&punc; We cannot better advi&s;e you on the &s;ubject of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> in the words of the excellent charge
<PB N="92" REF="035738_0092_1006500D99471D78">
addre&s;&s;ed to the Mi&s;&s;ionaries already mentioned.* "Let me advi&s;e you not only to guard again&s;t falling out by the way, (which God prevent!) and to love one another out of a pure heart fervently, but even let the poor ignorant natives <HI>take knowledge</HI> of you, that you do &s;o love one another, and that with the love of benevolence you are affectionately attached to <HI>them.</HI> Let them be con&s;trained to &s;ay, 'Behold how the&s;e new-comers love one another!' And again, in the words of the In&s;tructions; "Bear and forbear: holding the unity of the &s;pirit in the bond of peace. Satan's chief device will be to divide you. Form no parties, nor cabals; ever remember the words of the Lord: <HI>He</HI> is the great|e&s;t in his kingdom, who is the <HI>&s;ervant of all.</HI> We reque&s;t it &s;olemnly, we adjure you in the Great Ma&s;ter's name, <HI>Love one another out of a pure heart fervently.</HI> Your examples mu&s;t preach as powerful|ly as your words. But if ever bitter envyings and &s;trife ari&s;e, you will put an effectual bar to your own u&s;efulne&s;s, and defeat the great purpo&s;e of your mi&s;&s;ion. Let all your zeal, therefore, be re&s;erved for your work, and let no &s;elfi&s;h pa&s;&s;ions mingle with it, to corrupt the &s;implicity which is in Chri&s;t."</P>
<P N="4">IV. <HI>The formation of religious a&s;&s;emblies, and the admini&s;tration of ordinances.</HI> It will be proper to have &s;ixed places in the villages or mo&s;t populous di&s;tricts where to a&s;&s;emble, with the Indians who may attend, on the Lord's day, and occa&s;ionally on other days, for public wor&s;hip; and when circum|&s;tances admit, to con&s;titute regular congregations.
<PB N="93" REF="035738_0093_100646DBF165E790">
This &s;hould not, however prevent the itinerating from place to place, where acce&s;s can be had for preaching the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as a few Indians are brought to embrace the faith, are in&s;tructed in the great truths of reli|gion, and give good hope of &s;tedfa&s;tne&s;s in their profe&s;&s;ion, they are to be publicly initiated the church by bapti&s;m, and afterwards their children. As &s;oon al&s;o, as it appears to be for edification, the holy &s;upper of our Lord is to be admini&s;tered to all the baptized adults. We enjoin, at the &s;ame time, that none be admitted to the&s;e &s;eals of the cove|nant, without frequent conver&s;ation, and &s;ufficient &s;pace for trial. A ha&s;ty admi&s;&s;ion is injurious to the per&s;ons them&s;elves, and they may, by their apo&s;tacy, deeply wound the cau&s;e of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>When Indian women &s;eek in&s;truction in private, let one of the women of the mi&s;&s;ion be their teach|er; or, let the conver&s;ation be held in the pre&s;ence of their hu&s;bands, fathers, or others, &s;o as to avoid temptation, and the &s;malle&s;t cau&s;e of &s;u&s;picion to the Indians. We enjoin the utmo&s;t circum&s;pection in this matter.</P>
<P>Happy con&s;equences will en&s;ue from teaching the Indians the u&s;efulne&s;s and &s;acredne&s;s of the Lord's day, from teaching them the nature and du|ties of the married &s;tate, and, as frequently as po&s;&s;i|ble, &s;olemnizing it with exhortation and prayer.</P>
<P>As the &s;inging of p&s;alms is a nece&s;&s;ary and agree|able part of divine wor&s;hip, we recommend that it be introduced as &s;oon as convenient. It will be acceptable to the Indians, and as &s;uch you &s;hould
<PB N="94" REF="035738_0094_100650122895DCB0">
practice it in your private and public devotion, and teach it to them. The tunes which are adopted &s;hould be of the &s;imple&s;t, ea&s;ie&s;t, and grave&s;t kind.</P>
<P>Some of the Indians who give rea&s;onable evi|dence of their conver&s;ion, and are otherwi&s;e the be&s;t qualified, may be profitably employed as interpret|ers, in&s;tructors, or exhorters. Their knowledge of the language, di&s;po&s;itions and manners of their bre|thren, will give them a powerful advantage, and they will be an un&s;peakable &s;ecurity, &s;upport and comfort to you.</P>
<P N="5">V. <HI>The e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;chools for children.</HI> This will require your early and unintermitted attention. By in&s;tructing children, or rather <HI>youth,</HI> in the En|gli&s;h language, the way will be prepared for preach|ing the go&s;pel hereafter with &s;ucce&s;s, and there will be an opportunity of in&s;tilling &s;ound principles, and gradually gaining them over to civilization and religion. Were no other pre&s;ent advantage to offer than this, the next generation might &s;ee the mo&s;t exten&s;ive and beneficial effects. Wherever a &s;chool or &s;chools can be e&s;tabli&s;hed, it will be the duty of the per&s;ons employed to teach, diligently to attend to this bu&s;ine&s;s; and while the children are taught the mo&s;t common branches of learning, to teach them the principles of the Chri&s;tian religion, and to lead them, morning and evening, in prayer and &s;inging prai&s;es to God.</P>
<P N="6">VI. <HI>Ob&s;ervations on the language and cu&s;toms of the Indians, and on the pro&s;pects of making &s;ettlements, and extending the go&s;pel among them.</HI> Every thing which relates to the Indians, is an object not on|ly of curio&s;ity, but of real utility. By their lan|guage
<PB N="95" REF="035738_0095_10065013B31B38B0">
and cu&s;toms we are mo&s;t likely to arrive at their origin. A vocabulary of Engli&s;h words, pre|pared and already &s;ent out by a Gentleman engaged in inquiries of this kind, will be put into your hands, and you are de&s;ired to mark the Indian names for the&s;e things, that &s;o the number of lan|guages and the different dialects may be a&s;certained. The Directors will make inquiry as to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance which is to be expected from the tran&s;lations which have been made into &s;ome Indian languages of parts of the holy &s;criptures, and, if found &s;erviceable, means will be taken to &s;upply you with them.</P>
<P>On the &s;ubject of obtaining land, and forming a &s;ettlement among them, you are to be extremely cautious, as they di&s;cover jealou&s;y and oppo&s;ition. We advi&s;e that you do not &s;olicit it, but wait for the propo&s;al to come from them; and that you &s;how them that you are not actuated by ambition or ava|rice, and de&s;ire no farther footing or property among them than is nece&s;&s;ary in order to your &s;erving them in their mo&s;t valuable intere&s;ts. In this delicate affair, and one which may be attended <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> con&s;equences, we think it our duty <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> you, that no grant of land is to be accepted by any mi&s;&s;ion|ary for his per&s;onal emolument; that if any offer be made by the Indians, it &s;hall be &s;ent by you to the Directors of the Society, and accepted by them, if judged proper, for the general benefit of the mi&s;|&s;ion. Whenever a &s;ettlement is formed, it will be your duty to attend, at proper &s;ea&s;ons, to the cul|tivation of the land, and to the practice of me|chanic arts, in order to benefit the Indians, and a&s;&s;i&s;t in your own maintenance. Implements will be given you by the Society for this purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="035738_0096_1006501544BB78B8">You are carefully to remark what pro&s;pects ap|pear of propagating the go&s;pel among the nation you fir&s;t vi&s;it, and other nations around; what Mi&s;&s;ionaries are needed and might be u&s;efully em|ployed; and what things are nece&s;&s;ary to give &s;uc|ce&s;s and permanency to mi&s;&s;ions. The&s;e and every thing proper for the information of the Society, together with the copy of an exact journal which you mu&s;t keep of all your proceedings, you are to tran&s;mit to the Secretary once every &s;ix months, and oftener if occa&s;ion requires. We recommend that every per&s;on in the mi&s;&s;ion keep a particular diary of his own; that you unre&s;ervedly communi|cate to one another every material occurrence; and that you appoint one of your number to arrange a general diary of the whole, a copy of which is to be tran&s;mitted, and to conduct your corre&s;pondence.</P>
<P>Finally, be a&s;&s;ured, our beloved brethren in the Lord, that nothing in our power &s;hall be wanting to contribute to your &s;upport, your comfort, and your &s;ucce&s;s. Do not faint, or be di&s;couraged un|der the difficulties with which you may have to &s;truggle. <HI>Endure hardne&s;s as good &s;oldiers of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.

<HEAD>THE REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS.</HEAD>
<P>SOON after the la&s;t report, the Directors adopt|ed a plan for &s;ocial prayer which has been carried into execution, and it is believed, has been attended with beneficial effects. The &s;econd wed|ne&s;day in every month, meetings are held for this purpo&s;e in rotation, in all the churches of which the Mini&s;ters are members of the Society; and, though no contributions are urged, yet whatever are made, are applied for the benefit of the Society.</P>
<P>The Directors judged it to be their duty to begin a Mi&s;&s;ion as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, and accordingly they early appointed a committee to obtain Mi&s;&s;ionaries, and arrange what appeared nece&s;&s;ary on this head. The committee adverti&s;ed time after time with little apparent &s;ucce&s;s. Receiving, however, intimation
<PB N="98" REF="035738_0098_10065019C1A7D7E8">
from the Rev. Mr. Jo&s;eph Bullen, of Vermont, that he would be willing to accept an appointment as a Mi&s;&s;ionary, and being a&s;certained as to his cha|racter and qualifications, they recommended him; and the Directors agreed to employ him at the an|nual &s;alary of three hundred and &s;eventy-five dollars, and to defray his expences in travelling to the place of his de&s;tination. They agreed, at the &s;ame time, that it would be mo&s;t eligible to attempt the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of a Mi&s;&s;ion fir&s;t among the Chicka&s;aw Indians, a nation on the we&s;tern borders of the &s;tate of Georgia; and Mr. Bullen was reque&s;ted to come on without delay. They al&s;o advanced him part of his &s;alary to a&s;&s;i&s;t in his preparation, and reque&s;ted him to preach on a certain evening in one of the churches, on which occa&s;ion the Pre&s;ident of the Society was appointed to give him a charge as to the duties of his mi&s;&s;ion. The above reque&s;t was complied with on the 21&s;t of la&s;t month, when he preached, received a charge, and was &s;et apart to his work by &s;olemn prayer. The Directors &s;upplied him with a few books and articles which were deemed proper, and advanced him two hundred and fifty dollars to defray the expences incidental to his journey and mi&s;&s;ion. He left this city on the 26th of la&s;t month, accompanied by his &s;on, a lad of about &s;eventeen years of age, and who, it is &s;uppo&s;ed, will readily acquire the Indian language, and may be u&s;eful in teaching the Indian children; but he is not, at pre&s;ent, in the employ of the Di|rectors. Certain documents from the Government of the United States were cheerfully granted at Philadelphia to Mr. Bullen, and private directions and letters were given him by Gentlemen who kind|ly and warmly intere&s;ted them&s;elves in the bu&s;ine&s;s. The la&s;t account of him is from Lanca&s;ter in Penn|&s;ylvania
<PB N="99" REF="035738_0099_1006501B507CA848">
on the fir&s;t of this month, when he wrote that his journey had been &s;o far pro&s;perous, and that he had not been without evident tokens of the divine pre&s;ence.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Since this report was made, a letter has been received from Mr. Bullen, dated Knoxville, in the &s;tate of Tene&s;&s;ee, April 24th. He had arrived, through the goodne&s;s of Pro|vidence, thus far &s;afe; and he mentions that, according to his be&s;t information, he had to travel five hundred miles farther by land before he could reach the Chicka&s;aw towns. He mentions al&s;o, that the Cherokees who re&s;ide in the vicinity of the Tene&s;&s;ee are de&s;irous of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> Mi&s;&s;ionaries among them.</NOTE></P>
<P>The Directors farther report, that on the petition referred by the Society to them, from the Rev. Mr. John Sergeant, a Mi&s;&s;ionary to the Stockbridge In|dians, they have &s;ent for his relief one hundred dollars, and they have been happy to learn that the relief was uncommonly &s;ea&s;onable. They have al&s;o granted &s;ixty dollars for one year to Paul an Indian preacher who labours among the remains of the Shinnecock, Montack, and Poo&s;pettuck tribes in Su&s;&s;olk county, Long-I&s;land.</P>
<P>Letters have been received by the Secretary from the Gla&s;gow Mi&s;&s;ionary Society, and from the par|ticular Bapti&s;t Mi&s;&s;ionary Society in England, in an&s;wer to letters written to them.</P>
<P>The general In&s;tructions to Mi&s;&s;ionaries, the Ad|dre&s;s to the Chiefs and Indians of the Chicka&s;aw nations, and the Charge given to the fir&s;t Mi&s;&s;ion|ary, accompany this report.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="035738_0100_10065088DC917618">
The Society and its benevolent &s;upporters will &s;ee that the Directors have not been inattentive to the important tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them; but that they have pro&s;ecuted it, under the &s;miles of heaven, to a degree of &s;ucce&s;s. If the pro&s;pects of the Mi&s;&s;ion|ary already &s;ent &s;hould prove encouraging, it is in|tended to &s;trengthen him by others; nor are re|&s;ources to be de&s;paired of, in this glorious undertak|ing. Incon&s;iderable as the beginnings may &s;eem, no one can calculate their probable increa&s;e, and tendency to promote the kingdom of the divine Redeemer. He is King on the holy hill of Zion, and it is the irrever&s;ible decree of God the Father, to give to his Son <HI>the heathen for his inheritance, and the uttermo&s;t parts of the earth for his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</HI></P>

<P>The Society, at their annual meeting in Novem|ber la&s;t did little more than elect Officers and Di|rectors for the en&s;uing year. Such was the de|rangement occa&s;ioned by the mortal &s;ickne&s;s which had prevailed in the city, that they adjourned to meet on the 23d of April following, then to hear the &s;ermons, and to tran&s;act whatever bu&s;ine&s;s &s;eemed nece&s;&s;ary. Though the report of the Di|rectors contains &s;ome things which, &s;trictly, belong to the report to be made at the next annual meet|ing, yet it was judged be&s;t to give a &s;ummary ac|count of proceedings till the pre&s;ent time.</P>
<P>The Society having tran&s;acted their bu&s;ine&s;s with harmony and affection, with gratitude to God who had pro&s;pered them thus far, and with plea&s;ing
