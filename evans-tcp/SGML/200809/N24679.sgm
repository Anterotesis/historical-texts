<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THE</HI> following intere&s;ting work was originally read before the Royal Society of Agriculture at <HI>Lyons,</HI> of which the author was then Pre&s;ident; and &s;oon after that before the Royal Society of <HI>Pa|ris.</HI>&mdash;It was &s;o well received by tho&s;e learned bod|ies, that it &s;oon found its way to the pre&s;s, and has &s;ince been tran&s;lated and re-printed in <HI>London. M. LE POIVRE</HI>'s manner is ea&s;y and elegant&mdash;his ob&s;ervations &s;triking and judicious&mdash;his &s;entiments philanthropic and benevolent.&mdash;His principal aim appears to be to prove that the genuine happine&s;s of every nation depends upon the improvements of <HI>Agriculture;</HI> and that for this end the property of the indu&s;trious ought to be permanently &s;ecured by laws and modes of government that &s;hould be &s;ubject to no violation.</P>
<P>For the benefit of the <HI>American</HI> Farmers and Legi&s;lators it is now re-printed, in hopes that it may be an incitement to a proper mode of thinking on the &s;ubject of Agriculture, as well as to greater exertions and indu&s;try among the different ranks of people among&s;t us.</P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<P>EVERY people, however barbarous, have arts peculiar to them&s;elves. The diver&s;i|ty of climates, whil&s;t it varies the wants of man|kind, offers to their indu&s;try different produc|tions on which to exerci&s;e it. Every country, at a certain degree of di&s;tance, has fabrics &s;o &s;ingu|larly peculiar to it&s;elf, that they could not have been the fabrics of other regions: but agricul|ture, in every climate, is the univer&s;al art of mankind: from one extreme of the globe to the other, nations &s;till barbarous, as well as tho&s;e who&s;e ideas are civilized, procure to them&s;elves, at lea&s;t, a part of their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence by the culture of their fields; yet this art, however univer&s;al, is not every where equally flouri&s;hing.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="032696_0004_0FF429CC3647D020">It never fails to pro&s;per among wi&s;e nations, who know how to honor and encourage it;&mdash;it &s;upports it&s;elf but feebly among&s;t a people half poli&s;hed, who either prefer to it frivolous arts, or who, being &s;ufficiently enlightened perhaps to per|ceive its utility, are &s;till too much &s;laves to the prejudices of their ancient barbarity, to affran|chize and confer honors on tho&s;e who exerci&s;e it;&mdash;it langui&s;hes, and its influence is &s;carcely to be ob&s;erved among&s;t barbarians, who de&s;pi&s;e it. The &s;tate of agriculture has ever been the princi|pal object of my re&s;earches among the various people I have &s;een in the cour&s;e of my voyages. It is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for a traveller, who perhaps only pa&s;&s;es through a country, to make &s;uch re|marks as are nece&s;&s;ary to convey a ju&s;t idea of the government, police, and manners of the inhabit|ants. In &s;uch a ca&s;e, the criterion which be&s;t mar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s the internal &s;tate of a nation, is to ob&s;erve the public markets, and the face of the country. If the markets abound in provi&s;ions, if the fields are well cultivated, and covered with rich crops, then in general you may conclude that the coun|try is well peopled, that the inhabitants are civil|ized and happy, that their manners are poli&s;hed, and their government agreeable to the principles of rea&s;on.&mdash;You may then &s;ay to your&s;elf, I am among&s;t <HI>Men.</HI></P>
<P>When, on the contrary, I have arrived among&s;t a people, whom it was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;earch for amid&s;t fore&s;ts, who&s;e neglected lands were over|grown with brambles; when I have traver&s;ed
<PB N="7" REF="032696_0004_0FF429CC3647D020">
large tracts of uncultivated de&s;arts, and then at la&s;t &s;tumbled on a grubb'd-up wretchedly culti|vated field; when arrived at length at &s;ome can|ton, I have ob&s;erved nothing in the public mar|ket but a few &s;orry roots, I no longer he&s;itated to determine the inhabitants to be wretched &s;ava|ges, or groaning under the mo&s;t oppre&s;&s;ive &s;la|very.</P>
<P>I never remember a &s;ingle in&s;tance of being obliged to retract this fir&s;t idea, conceived &s;imply by in&s;pecting the &s;tate of agriculture among&s;t the various nations I have &s;een: the knowledge of various particulars, which a long re&s;idence among&s;t many of them has enabled me to acquire, has ever confirmed me in opinion, that a country poorly cultivated is always inhabited by men bar|barous or oppre&s;&s;ed, and that population there can never be con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>You will ob&s;erve by the detail I now offer you of my enquiries, that in every country agriculture depends ab&s;olutely on the laws, the manners, and even on the e&s;tabli&s;hed prejudices of the re&s;pective inhabitants. I &s;hall begin with ob&s;ervations on &s;ome parts of Africa.</P>

<HEAD>The We&s;tern Coa&s;ts of Africa.</HEAD>
<P>The i&s;lands and we&s;tern di&s;tricts of this part of the world which I have &s;een, are for the greater part uncultivated lands, inhabited by unhappy ne|groes. The&s;e wretched men, who have &s;o poor
<PB N="8" REF="032696_0005_0FF4310BE4FD1DC0">
an e&s;timation of them&s;elves as to &s;ell one anoth|er, never employ a thought on the cultivation of their lands. Satisfied to exi&s;t from day to day, under a climate where their wants are few, they cultivate ju&s;t as much as prevents their dying of hunger; they carele&s;sly &s;ow every year &s;ome maize, a very little rice, and plant, in &s;mall quan|tities, different kinds of potatoes, not of the na|ture of ours, though the culture is much the &s;ame; we know them by the name of <HI>yams.</HI> In gener|al their harve&s;ts are &s;o poor, that the Europeans, who re&s;ort to them for the purcha&s;e of &s;laves, are obliged to bring from Europe or America the pro|vi&s;ions nece&s;&s;ary for the maintenance of tho&s;e unfortunate creatures doomed to compo&s;e their cargoes.</P>
<P>The negroes, who inhabit the environs of the European colonies, give &s;omewhat more atten|tion to agriculture than the others;&mdash;they rear &s;locks; they cultivate rice in greater quantities; and in their gardens are found pul&s;e, of which the &s;eed has been brought from Europe; yet all they know of agriculture, they have learnt from the Europeans &s;ettled among&s;t them; their own ex|perience is extremely bounded; and I have nev|er been able to di&s;cover in their indu&s;try any proce&s;s which could in the lea&s;t improve our own.</P>
<P>From the river of Angola to Cape Negroe, and from thence till you approach the Cape of Good Hope, nothing is to be &s;een but &s;terile uncultivated

lands; the coa&s;ts are naked, and covered with barren &s;ands; and you are under the nece&s;&s;ity of travelling many leagues before yon can di&s;cover a palm-tree, or the &s;lighte&s;t verdure. The coun|try and its few inhabitants &s;eem to be &s;truck with one common cur&s;e. From the informations I have received touching the&s;e countries from the Italian mi&s;&s;ionaries, who, with an admirable zeal, have penetrated into the heart of the&s;e accur&s;ed re|gions, I learn likewi&s;e that agriculture is ju&s;t as languid in the interior parts as upon the coa&s;ts, al|though, in many places, the &s;oil appeared much more fruitful from its natural productions.</P>

<HEAD>The Cape of Good Hop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HEAD>
<P>The countries around the Cape were condemn|ed to the &s;ame &s;terility before the Dutch took po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of them; but &s;ince their e&s;tabli&s;hment on this point of Africa, the lands produce in abun|dance wheat and grain of every kind, wines of different qualities, and a con&s;iderable quantity of exellent fruits, collected from every quarter of the world: There you &s;ee exten&s;ive pa&s;tures covered with hor&s;es, black cattle, and &s;heep&mdash; the&s;e herds and flocks thrive exceedingly well. The abundance which this colony enjoys, com|pared to the barrenne&s;s of the &s;urrounding coun|tries, evidently demon&s;trates that the earth de|nies her favors only to the tyrant and the &s;lave; but becomes prodigal of her trea&s;ures, beyond the mo&s;t &s;anguine hope, &s;o &s;oon as &s;he is free, and cultivated by men of di&s;cernment, whom wi&s;e and invariable laws protect.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="032696_0006_0FF4310D69A28DD8">A number of Frenchmen, forced from their coun|try by the revocation of the edict of Nantz, have on this coa&s;t found a new e&s;tabli&s;hment, and with it, &s;ecurity, property, and liberty, the only true encouragers of agriculture, the only principles of abundance. They have enriched this adopted mother by their indu&s;try; they have there founded con&s;iderable colonies, &s;ome of which bear the name of that unhappy country which de|nied them the u&s;e of water and of fire, the re|membrance of which however they &s;till fondly cheri&s;h.</P>
<P>The colony of Little Rochelle &s;urpa&s;&s;es all the re&s;t, by the indu&s;try of the coloni&s;ts, and the fertil|ity of the lands which belong to it. The pa&s;tures are there compo&s;ed of a variety of gra&s;&s;es, natives of the country, together with &s;everal different &s;pecies of herbage, which compo&s;e our artificial meadows in Europe, &s;uch as trefoil, lucern, and faintfoin. The exotic plants, the &s;eeds of which have been imported by the Dutch, flouri&s;h there as the natural productions of the country. Tho&s;e &s;eeds are &s;own by an operation of the plough; they cut the gra&s;s only the fir&s;t year; the &s;econd they open the meadows to cattle, which live there at di&s;cretion, without any other attention than that of collecting them together every evening into a park enclo&s;ed with &s;trong and high palli|&s;ades, to &s;ecure them again&s;t the lions and tigers, with which this country abounds.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="032696_0006_0FF4310D69A28DD8">Some of the&s;e enclo&s;ures are watered only by the rains, although they generally endeavor to chu&s;e them in the neighborhood of &s;ome brook, where they dig commodious watering places. In all the&s;e pa&s;turages, they have an eye to groves of trees, where the herds and flocks may find &s;hel|ter again&s;t the inten&s;e heat of the &s;un; particu|larly in January, February and March, which in this part of the world are the mo&s;t &s;ultry months in the year.</P>
<P>The arable land is here labored as in Europe, &s;ometimes by hor&s;es, but oftener by oxen: the Dutch of this colony have by their indu&s;try cor|rected the natural &s;luggi&s;hne&s;s of the&s;e latter ani|mals, by exerci&s;ing them while young in a bri&s;k pace; in con&s;equence of which I have &s;een, at the Cape, carriages, drawn by teams of ten or a dozen yoke of oxen, go as expeditiou&s;ly as if drawn by hor&s;es.</P>
<P>The grains commonly &s;own at the Cape, are wheat, turkey corn, and rice; the&s;e generally produce an increa&s;e of fifty-fold. They culti|vate a variety off different kinds of pul&s;e, &s;uch as pea&s;e, common beans, and French beans. This pul&s;e makes a refre&s;hing provi&s;ion to the &s;hips touching at the Cape going or returning to In|dia.</P>
<P>A particular &s;pecies of this pul&s;e is much in re|que&s;t in India, to which they export a con&s;idera|ble quantity; it is there known by the name of
<PB N="12" REF="032696_0007_0FF4310EF2237AD0">
<HI>Cape-Pea&s;e:</HI> it is a kind of French bean which requires no prop; its grain is of the form of that bean, but larger and flatter; it ta&s;tes like our green peas, and pre&s;erves its fre&s;hne&s;s for a long time. I have this year attempted the culture of this plant, which promi&s;es &s;ucce&s;s. The climate at the Cape &s;eems to demand from the cultivator an attention which appears not &s;o nece&s;&s;ary in this country, and which would even perhaps be prejudicial to the productions of our lands.</P>
<P>The Cape however is expo&s;ed the greate&s;t part of the year to violent hurricanes, which blow generally from the north-ea&s;t. The&s;e winds are &s;o impetuous that they would beat down the fruits from the trees, and &s;weep to de&s;truction the la|bors of the farmer, had they not provided a bar|rier for the &s;ecurity of the harve&s;t. The Dutch coloni&s;ts have divided their lands into &s;mall fields, which they have &s;urrounded with high palli&s;ades of oaks and other trees, planted very clo&s;e to one another, &s;ome what re&s;embling a charmille, de|&s;igned for the ornament of a garden. The&s;e pal|li&s;ades they cut every year, as they grow; their height being commonly from twenty-five to thir|ty feet; every &s;eparate field, in con&s;equence, is enclo&s;ed like a chamber.</P>
<P>It is by this indu&s;try alone that the Dutch have rendered this colony not only the granary of all their &s;ettlements in the Ea&s;t-Indies, but the mo&s;t commodious place for ve&s;&s;els to touch at for re|fre&s;hments and provi&s;ions of all kinds.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="032696_0007_0FF4310EF2237AD0">When the Dutch began to form their vine|yards, they endeavored to procure plants from tho&s;e cantons which enjoyed the greate&s;t repu|tation for their wines; but after many fruitle&s;s attempts to produce, at the extremity of Africa, the vines of Burgundy and Champagne, they ap|plied to rearing the plants tran&s;ported from Spain, the Canaries, and the Levant, where the climate is more analagous to the Cape. At pre&s;ent the plants which are cultivated mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sfully, are tho&s;e of the Mu&s;cadel kind: the red Mu&s;cadel particularly, which they rear in a &s;mall di&s;trict called Con&s;tance, produces mo&s;t delicious wine; the Dutch Ea&s;t-India Company always &s;ecure this vintage, which they &s;end in pre&s;ents to the &s;over|eigns of Europe.</P>
<P>The vines at the Cape are cultivated without vine-props; the method of labour is much the &s;ame with that in France. The vineyards are &s;urrounded by a number of trees, upon which they entwine the &s;lips of the great Spani&s;h Mu&s;ca|dine, in form of e&s;paliers, very high, by which the vines are &s;heltered from the violence of the winds.</P>
<P>The &s;ame attention, at the Cape, is paid to gar|dening, as to the other branches of agriculture. You there find all the variety of European pul&s;e, greens, herbs, and roots, with the be&s;t of tho&s;e peculiar to other parts of the world. Indepen|dent of the gardens of the coloni&s;ts, which are kept in as fine order as any in Europe, the India
<PB N="14" REF="032696_0008_0FF431121B565638">
Company have cau&s;ed to lay out two or three gardens, exten&s;ive and magnificent, which they &s;upport with an expen&s;e worthy of a &s;overeign company.</P>
<P>Fifteen or twenty European gardeners, who&s;e abilities are approved before they are embarked, are employed in the cultivation of each of tho&s;e va&s;t gardens, under the direction of a principal gardener, who&s;e place is lucrative and honora|ble. It is in tho&s;e gardens, at the expen&s;e of the company, that all the experiments are made in every new &s;pecies of culture; and it is there that every private individual is provided gratis, with &s;uch plants and &s;eeds as he may have occa&s;ion for, together with the nece&s;&s;ary in&s;tructions for their cultivation. The&s;e gardens furni&s;h, in the great|e&s;t abundance, herbage and fruits of various kinds to the company's &s;hips.</P>
<P>Travellers cannot but with plea&s;ure and admi|ration ob&s;erve large enclo&s;ures con&s;ecrated to the &s;tudy and improvement of Botany, in which the mo&s;t rare and u&s;eful plants, from every quarter of the world, are arranged in the mo&s;t excellent order: the curious have the additional &s;atisfaction al&s;o of finding &s;kilful gardeners, who take plea|&s;ure in de&s;cribing and pointing out their virtues.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e beautiful gardens are terminated by large orchards, where are to be found all the fruits of Europe, together with &s;everal natives of Africa and A&s;ia. Nothing is more agreeable
<PB N="15" REF="032696_0008_0FF431121B565638">
than to &s;ee in different expo&s;itions, even in the &s;ame enclo&s;ure, the che&s;nut, the apple, and other trees, from the mo&s;t northern climates, together with the mu&s;cadine of the Indies, the camphres of Borneo, the palms, and a variety of other trees, which are natives of the torrid zone.</P>

<HEAD>MADAGASCAR.</HEAD>
<P>After doubling the Cape of Good Hope, you enter the Indian &s;ea, where you find the great I&s;l|and to Madaga&s;car: we are &s;till unacquainted with many places of this i&s;land, though the Portu|gue&s;e, Dutch, French, and other Europeans have had &s;ettlements, and frequented it, above two centuries. Tho&s;e parts which we know, are ve|ry fertile, and the inhabitants would in all proba|bility, cultivate them extremely well, were there a vent for their productions. They rear numer|ous herds of cattle and &s;heep; their pa&s;turages, &s;uch as nature has formed them, are rich: in ma|ny cantons are large tracts of tilled ground, cov|ered with gra&s;s of an extraordinary &s;ize, which grows to the height of five or &s;ix feet; the natives call it <HI>Fatak;</HI> it is excellent for nouri&s;hing and fattening their horned cattle, which are of the large&s;t &s;pecies, and differ in &s;hape from ours, par|ticularly by a large fle&s;hy protuberance on their neck.&mdash;Another gra&s;s, of a finer blade, &s;hoots &s;pontaneou&s;ly through the &s;ands on the &s;ea coa&s;t, which furni&s;hes food for the &s;heep: the&s;e are of the &s;ame &s;pecies with tho&s;e of Barbary, and differ from ours mo&s;t remarkably, by the mon&s;trous &s;ize
<PB N="16" REF="032696_0009_0FF4292DF5BC4190">
of their tails, which weigh in general from &s;ix to eight pounds.</P>
<P>The Madeca&s;&s;es or Malegaches (which is the name of the inhabitants of this i&s;land) cultivate &s;carce any other grain but rice: they &s;ow at the commencement of the rainy &s;ea&s;on; in con&s;e|quence of which they are not under the nece&s;&s;ity of watering their fields. In laboring their ground, they u&s;e no other in&s;trument but the pickaxe; they begin by grubbing up all the weeds; then five or &s;ix men, ranging them&s;elves in a line on the field, dig little holes as they pa&s;s along, into which the women or children, who follow, throw the grains of the rice, and then with their feet cover them with earth: a field &s;own in this man|ner produces an increa&s;e of above eighty or a hundred fold, which proves rather the extreme fertility of the &s;oil, than the goodne&s;s of the cul|tivation: badly under&s;tood as it may be, how|ever, the inhabitants of Madaga&s;car live in abun|dance. In no country in the world, that I have &s;een, are rice and other e&s;&s;ential provi&s;ions cheap|er than in this i&s;land. For a remnant of coar&s;e blue cloth, which may be worth perhaps twenty pence, the Madeca&s;&s;e gives two or three mea&s;ures of rice. The&s;e mea&s;ures are furni&s;hed by the Eu|ropeans, who never fail to enlarge them every year; yet the i&s;landers do not complain. The mea&s;ure is fir&s;t of all heaped; the buyer then, in virtue of an e&s;tabli&s;hed right for &s;ecuring good mea&s;ure, thru&s;ts his arm to the elbow in the rice, and with one &s;weep empties it almo&s;t entirely,
<PB N="17" REF="032696_0009_0FF4292DF5BC4190">
which the Madeca&s;&s;e has the patience a &s;econd time to repleni&s;h, without a murmur. This mea|&s;ure is called a <HI>Gamelle,</HI> which, thus filled, will hold about 160 pounds of pure rice.</P>
<P>There cannot be a doubt, but if our [the French] India Company, who alone are in po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of the trade with the natives of this i&s;land, would give proper encouragement to agriculture, it would in a &s;hort time make a rapid progre&s;s.&mdash; Our i&s;lands of Bourbon and France would here always find a certain re&s;ource again&s;t tho&s;e dearths which too frequently di&s;tre&s;s the latter of the&s;e i&s;lands. Our &s;quadrons bound for India, who put into the I&s;le of France for refre&s;hments, would there always find abundance of provi&s;ions brought from Madaga&s;car, and of con&s;equence would not be &s;ubjected to the nece&s;&s;ity of lo&s;ing their time at the Cape, or at Batavia, begging refre&s;hments from the Dutch, whil&s;t the enemies of France, as happened in the late war, are conquering their &s;ettlements, and de&s;troying their trade.</P>
<P>Wheat would grow in Madaga&s;car in the &s;ame abundance as rice: it was formerly cultivated &s;ucce&s;sfully in the &s;ettlement which we then po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed at the &s;outhern point of the i&s;land, called Fort Dauphin. Even at this day fine &s;talks of wheat are &s;till to be found there, produced from the &s;cattering grains of the ancient crops, which being blown about by the winds have annually, &s;ince our being drove from that &s;ettlement, &s;own of them&s;elves, and &s;prung up at random, among&s;t
<PB N="18" REF="032696_0010_0FF431139E6A58B0">
the native herbs of the country. The lands there are of inconceiveable fertility; the i&s;landers in|telligent and ingenious. In tho&s;e di&s;tricts where the Arabs have not penetrated, the &s;imple laws of nature are their guides; their manners the man|ners of the primitive ages. The&s;e laws, and the&s;e manners, are more favorable for agricul|ture, than all our &s;ublime &s;peculations, than all our mo&s;t applauded theories on the mo&s;t approv|ed practice; than all tho&s;e ineffectual means now employed to re-animate an art, which our man|ners teach us to regard with contempt, or treat with levity; and which is perpetually harra&s;&s;ed, perpetually oppre&s;&s;ed by innumerable abu&s;es, which derive their &s;ource from the very laws them&s;elves.</P>

<HEAD>The I&s;le of Bourbon.</HEAD>
<P>Almo&s;t 200 leagues ea&s;t of Madaga&s;car lie the two i&s;lands of Bourbon and France; the &s;oil of which is naturally as fertile as that of Madaga&s;|car, whil&s;t they enjoy a happier climate. Bour|bon has no port; it is of con&s;equence little fre|quented by the &s;hipping. The inhabitants have pre&s;erved their &s;implicity of manners, and aggri|culture is there in a flouri&s;hing &s;tate. The i&s;land produces wheat, rice, and maize, not only for its own con&s;umption, but even furni&s;hes a &s;mall &s;up|ply to the I&s;le of France: the culture there is the &s;ame as at Madaga&s;car. The horned cattle and &s;heep, which they have imported from that i&s;land, thrive here extremely well, e&s;pecially as they have

<P>The lands of this i&s;land are principally employ|ed in the culture of the coffee-tree. The fir&s;t plants of this &s;hrubby tree were brought from Mocha. It multiplies by its grains &s;owing &s;pon|taneou&s;ly; little attention is required; nothing more is nece&s;&s;ary than to grub up, three or four times during the fir&s;t year, the neighboring weeds, which would otherwi&s;e rob it of its proper nour|i&s;hment: the &s;econd year it grows without care; its branches, which extend horizontally along the &s;urface of the ground, by their &s;hade &s;tifle the growth of all &s;uch weeds, as might &s;hoot up within their circumference: at the end of eighteen months the coffee-tree begins to bear fruit, and in three years yields a plentiful crop. They plant the&s;e trees chequer-wi&s;e, at about the di&s;tance of &s;even feet from one another, and when they grow too tall, prune them to the height of perhaps two feet from the ground.</P>
<P>The coffee-tree demands a light &s;oil: it thrives better in &s;and almo&s;t pure, than in rich ground: they ob&s;erve in the i&s;le of Bourbon, that the&s;e trees yield annually, one with another, about a pound of coffee: this fruit comes to perfection, and is gathered in during dry weather, which gives it a great advantage over the We&s;t-india coffee, which never ripens nor is got-in but in the rainy &s;ea&s;ons. The coffee, after it is gather|ed

<HEAD>The I&s;le of France.</HEAD>
<P>This i&s;land po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es two excellent harbors, where all the &s;hipping of the French Company, employed in the commerce of China and the In|dies, touch for refre&s;hments; here al&s;o rendez|vous their armaments in times of war: this i&s;land is, of con&s;equence, not &s;o &s;olitary as Bourbon. The politics and manners of Europe have here more influence. The lands are as fertile as tho&s;e of Bourbon; rivulets, which are never dry, water it like a garden: notwith&s;tanding which, the harve&s;ts often fail, and &s;carcity is here almo&s;t perpetually felt.</P>
<P>Since the days of the celebrated M. de la Bourdonnois (who governed this i&s;land for ten or twelve years, and ought to be regarded, as the founder of the colony, for his introduction and patronage of agriculture) they have wandered in|ce&s;&s;antly from project to project, attempting the culture of almo&s;t every &s;pecies of plants, without properly pro&s;ecuting any one of them. The cof|fee, the cotton, the indigo, the &s;ugar-cane, the pear, the cinnamon, the mulberry, the tea, and the cocoa trees, have all been cultivated by ex|periments, but in &s;uch a &s;uperficial manner as
<PB N="21" REF="032696_0011_0FF4311524959DA8">
could never &s;ecure &s;ucce&s;s. Had they followed the &s;imple plan of the founder, which was to &s;e|cure bread, the i&s;land would at this day have been flouri&s;hing; abundance would then have reigned among&s;t the coloni&s;ts, and the &s;hipping never been di&s;appointed of the nece&s;&s;ary refre&s;h|ments and provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>The cultivation of grain, neverthele&s;s, though neglected and badly under&s;tood, is that which &s;uc|ceeds the be&s;t. Tho&s;e lands, which are &s;o em|ployed, yield annually a crop of wheat, and an|other of rice or Turkey-corn, without the inter|vention of one fallow year, and without the lea&s;t improvement, or any other mode of labor, than that which is practi&s;ed at Madaga&s;car.</P>
<P>The <HI>Maniac</HI> was fir&s;t introduced into this i&s;l|and by M. de la Bourdonnois: the culture of this plant was at fir&s;t attended with very great difficulty, but is now the principal re&s;ource of the coloni&s;ts for the nouri&s;hment of their &s;laves. As the culture of this root is here the &s;ame as in America, I &s;hall not repeat what has been relat|ed by a number of travellers.</P>
<P>They formerly brought from Madaga&s;car black cattle and &s;heep; but &s;ince they have di&s;covered that more advantage attends the tran&s;portation of &s;laves they have neglected the increa&s;e of their cattle, which the continual demands of the &s;hip|ping and the wants of the inhabitants at the &s;ame time daily dimini&s;h: Be&s;ides, they have never

hitherto formed any pa&s;tures; &s;uch as they have attempted having been laid out with &s;o little &s;kill, that they have not &s;ucceeded. The i&s;land produ|ces naturally, in different cantons, an excellent kind of gra&s;s, which grows to the height of five or &s;ix feet. This gra&s;s begins to appear above ground about the beginning of the rainy &s;ea&s;on; it performs all its vegetation during the three months, which this &s;ea&s;on la&s;ts: the inhabitants take advantage of this to pa&s;ture their herds, who fatien upon it amazingly; but the vegetation over, there remains nothing on the ground but a &s;traw too hard to afford nouri&s;hment to the cattle; and &s;oon after the fire, which is kindled here by a thou&s;and accidents, con&s;umes this &s;traw, and with it frequently part of the neighboring for|e&s;ts. During the remainder of the year, the herds wander about and langui&s;h among&s;t the woods.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t fault which has been committed in this i&s;land, and which has proved mo&s;t prejudicial to cultivation, is the method of clearing the woods from off the grounds by fire, without leav|ing groves and thickets at proper di&s;tances. The rains, in this i&s;land, conduce mo&s;t to the ameliora|tion of the grounds; but the clouds being &s;topt by the fore&s;ts, there the rains fall; whil&s;t the clear|ed lands are &s;carce watered by a &s;ingle drop: the fields, at the &s;ame time, being thus deprived of defence, are expo&s;ed to the violence of the winds, which often entirely de&s;troy the harve&s;ts.

<P>The conquerors, when they took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the country, appropriated to them&s;elves at the &s;ame time all the lands.

<P>If the grounds they propo&s;e watering, have neither rivulet nor fountain &s;ufficiently abundant, they dig a pit-well, on the brink of which they rai&s;e a pillar of near the &s;ame height as the depth of the well. At the &s;ummit of this pillar, which is forked, is an iron bar, which cro&s;&s;ing both divi|&s;ions horizontally, &s;upports a kind of &s;ee-&s;aw, to one end of which a ladder is &s;u&s;pended; the oth|er end of this &s;ee-&s;aw, projects from the top of the pillar about three feet, having a long pole fa&s;t|ened to it in a po&s;ition parallel with the pillar, at which hangs a large bucket of wood or copper: by the &s;ide of this machine is a large re&s;ervoir, built with bricks and clo&s;ely cemented, elevated above the level of the grounds they propo&s;e to water; the opening whence the waters are di&s;|charged being on that &s;ide which fronts the field.

As &s;oon as the re&s;er|voir is full, they open a kind of &s;luice; the inun|dation begins, and is kept con&s;tantly flowing by the operations of the&s;e two men, who &s;ometimes are thus employed whole days, the one a&s;cending and de&s;cending, the other throwing the bucket in|to the well, and emptying it when full.</P>

<HEAD>THE MALAIS.</HEAD>
<P>Beyond the kingdom of Siam is the penin&s;ula of Malacca; a country formerly well peopled, and, con&s;equently, well cultivated. This nation was once one of the greate&s;t powers, and made a very con&s;iderable figure on the theatre of A&s;ia. The &s;ea was covered with their &s;hips, and they carried on a mo&s;t exten&s;ive commerce. Their laws, however, were apparently very different from tho&s;e which &s;ub&s;i&s;t among them at pre&s;ent. From time to time they &s;ent out numbers of colo|nies, which, one after another, peopled the i&s;lands of Sumatra, Ja<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a, Borneo, the Celebes or Maca&s;|&s;or, the Moluccas, the Philippines, and tho&s;e innu|merable i&s;lands of the Archipelago, which bound A&s;ia on the ea&s;t, and which occupy an extent of &s;even hundred leagues, in longitude, from ea&s;t to we&s;t, by about &s;ix hundred of latitude, from north to &s;outh. The inhabitants of all the&s;e i&s;lands, tho&s;e at lea&s;t upon the coa&s;ts, are the &s;ame peo|ple; they &s;peak almo&s;t the &s;ame language, have the &s;ame laws, the &s;ame manners.&mdash;Is it not &s;omewhat &s;ingular, that this nation, who&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions are &s;o exten&s;ive, &s;hould &s;carce be known in Europe?&mdash;I &s;hall endeavor to give you an idea of
<PB N="38" REF="032696_0020_0FF4312CED4B65E0">
tho&s;e laws, and tho&s;e manners; you will, from thence, ea&s;ily judge of their agriculture.</P>
<P>Travellers, who make ob&s;ervations on the Malais, are a&s;toni&s;hed to find, in the centre of A&s;ia, under the &s;corching climate of the line, the laws, the manners, the cu&s;toms, and the prejudi|ces of the ancient inhabitants of the north of Eu|rope. The Malais are governed by feudal laws, that capricious &s;y&s;tem, conceived for the defence of the liberty of a few again&s;t the tyranny of one, whil&s;t the multitude is &s;ubjected to &s;lavery and oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>A chief who has the title of king, or &s;ultan, i&s;&s;ues his commands to his great va&s;&s;als, who obey when they think proper. The&s;e have inferior va&s;&s;als, who often act in the &s;ame manner with re|gard to them. A &s;mall part of the nation live independent, under the title of <HI>Oramoai,</HI> or <HI>noble,</HI> and &s;ell their &s;ervices to tho&s;e who pay them be&s;t; whil&s;t the body of the nation is com|po&s;ed of &s;laves, and live in perpetual &s;ervi|tude.</P>
<P>With the&s;e laws the Malais are re&s;tle&s;s, fond of navigation, war, plunder, emigrations, colo|nies, de&s;perate enterpri&s;es, adventures, and gal|lantry. They talk ince&s;&s;antly of their honor, and their bravery, whil&s;t they are univer&s;ally con&s;id|ered, by tho&s;e with whom they have intercour&s;e, as the mo&s;t treacherous, ferocious people on the face of the globe; and yet, which appeared to
<PB N="39" REF="032696_0020_0FF4312CED4B65E0">
me extremely &s;ingular, they &s;peak the &s;ofte&s;t lan|guage of A&s;ia. That which the Count de Forbin has &s;aid, in his memoirs, of the ferocity of the Maca&s;&s;ars, is exactly true, and is the reigning characteri&s;tic of the whole Malay nations. More attached to the ab&s;urd laws of their pretended honor, than to tho&s;e of ju&s;tice or humanity, you always ob&s;erve, that among&s;t them, the &s;trong oppre&s;s and de&s;troy the weak: their treaties of peace and friend&s;hip never &s;ub&s;i&s;ting beyond that &s;elf-intere&s;t which induced them to make them, they are almo&s;t always armed, and either at war among&s;t them&s;elves, or employed in pillaging their neighbors.</P>
<P>This ferocity, which the Malais qualify under the name of courage, is &s;o well known to the Eu|ropean companies, who have &s;ettlements in the Indies, that they have univer&s;ally agreed in pro|hibiting the captains of their &s;hips, who may put into the Maley I&s;lands, from taking on board any &s;eamen, of that nation, except in the greate&s;t di&s;|tre&s;s, and then, on no account, to exceed two or three.</P>
<P>It is nothing uncommon for a handful of the&s;e horrid &s;avages &s;uddenly to embark, attack a ve&s;|&s;el by &s;urpri&s;e, poignard, in hand, ma&s;&s;acre the people, and make them&s;elves ma&s;ters of her. Malay batteaus, with twenty-five or thirty men, have been known to board European &s;hips of thirty or forty guns, in order to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them, and murder with their poignards great
<PB N="40" REF="032696_0021_0FF429350BAF0EF0">
part of the crew. The Malay hi&s;tory is full of &s;uch enterpri&s;es, which mark the de&s;perate fero|city of the&s;e barbarians.</P>
<P>The Malais, who are not &s;laves, go always armed: they would think them&s;elves di&s;graced, if they went abroad without their poignards, which they call <HI>Crit.</HI> The indu&s;try of this nation even &s;urpa&s;&s;es it&s;elf, in the fabric of this de&s;truc|tive weapon.</P>
<P>As their lives are a perpetual round of agita|tion and tumult, they could never endure the long flowing habits, which prevail among&s;t the other A&s;iatics. The habits of the Malais are ex|actly adapted to their &s;hapes, and loaded with a multitude of buttons, which fa&s;ten them clo&s;e to their bodies in every part.&mdash;I relate the&s;e &s;eem|ingly trifling ob&s;ervations, in order to prove, that, in climates the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite, the &s;ame laws pro|duce &s;imilar manners, cu&s;toms, and prejudices. Their effect is the &s;ame too with re&s;pect to agri|culture.</P>
<P>The lands po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Malais are, in gen|eral, of a &s;uperior quality. Nature &s;eems to have taken plea&s;ure in there a&s;&s;embling her mo&s;t favorite productions. They have not only tho&s;e to be found in the territories of Siam, but a vari|ety of others peculiar to the&s;e i&s;lands. The coun|try is covered with odoriferous woods, &s;uch as the eagle or aloes wood, the &s;andal, and the ca&s;&s;ia odorata, a &s;pecies of cinnamon. You there breathe
<PB N="41" REF="032696_0021_0FF429350BAF0EF0">
an air impregnated with the odours of innumera|ble flowers of the greate&s;t fragrance, of which there is a perpetual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion the year round, the &s;weet flavour of which captivates the &s;oul, and in&s;pires the mo&s;t voluptuous &s;en&s;ations. No traveller, wandering over the plains of Malacca, but feels him&s;elf &s;trongly impelled to wi&s;h his re&s;idence fixed in a place &s;o luxuriant in allure|ments, where nature triumphs without the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of art.</P>
<P>The Malay i&s;lands produce various kinds of dying woods, particularly the <HI>Sapan,</HI> which is the &s;ame with the Bra&s;il wood. There are al&s;o a number of gold mines, which the inhabitants of Sumatra and Mallaca call <HI>Ophirs:</HI> &s;ome of which, tho&s;e e&s;pecially on the ea&s;tern coa&s;t, are richer than tho&s;e of Bra&s;il or Peru. There are likewi&s;e mines of fine copper, mixed with gold, which the inhabitants name <HI>Tombage.</HI> In the i&s;lands of Su|matra and Banea are mines of calin, or fine tin; and at Succadana, in the i&s;land of Borneo, is a mine of diamonds. Tho&s;e i&s;lands enjoy al&s;o ex|clu&s;ively, the rotin, the &s;agou, (or bread-palm-tree) the camphre, and other precious aromatics, which we know under the names of various &s;pice|ries.</P>
<P>The &s;ea too teems with abundance of excellent fi&s;h, together with ambergris, pearls, and tho&s;e de|licate birds ne&s;ts (&s;o much in reque&s;t in China) formed in the rocks with the &s;pawn of fi&s;hes, and the foam of the &s;ea, by a &s;pecies of &s;mall &s;ized

&s;wallow, peculiar to tho&s;e &s;eas: this is of &s;uch an exqui&s;ite &s;ub&s;tance and flavor, that the Chine&s;e long purcha&s;ed them for their weight in gold, and &s;till buy them at an exce&s;&s;ive price.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of all this luxuriance of nature, the Malay is mi&s;erable. The culture of the lands, abandoned to &s;laves, is fallen into con|tempt. The&s;e wretched laborers, dragged in|ce&s;&s;antly from their ru&s;tic employments by their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;tle&s;s ma&s;ters, who delight in war and maritime enterpri&s;es, have rarely time, and never re&s;olu|tion, to give the nece&s;&s;ary attention to the labor|ing of their grounds. Their lands, in general, remain uncultivated; and produce no kind of grain for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the inhabitants.</P>
<DIV4 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Sagou.</HEAD>
<P>The &s;agou-tree, in part, &s;upplies the defect of grain. This admirable tree is a pre&s;ent which bountiful nature has made to men incapable of labor. It requires no culture; it is a &s;pecies of the palm-tree, which grows naturally, in the woods, to the height of about twenty or thirty feet; its circumference being &s;ometimes from five to &s;ix. Its ligneous bark is about an inch in thickne&s;s, and covers a multitude of long fibres, which, be|ing interwoven one with another, envelope a ma&s;s of gummy kind of meal. As &s;oon as this tree is ripe, a whiti&s;h du&s;t, which tran&s;pires thro' the pores of the leaves, and adheres to their extremities, proclaims its maturity. The Malais then cut them
<PB N="43" REF="032696_0022_0FF4312E71CB9AB8">
down near the root, divide them into &s;everal &s;ec|tions, which they &s;plit into quarters: they then &s;coop out the ma&s;s of mealy &s;ub&s;tance, which is enveloped by and adheres to the fibres; they di|lute it in pure water, and then pa&s;s it through a &s;training bag of fine cloth, in order to &s;eparate it from the fibres. When this pa&s;te has lo&s;t part of its moi&s;ture by evaporation, the Malais throw it into a kind of earthen ve&s;&s;els, of different &s;hapes, where they allow it to dry and harden. This pa&s;te is whole&s;ome, nouri&s;hing food, and pre&s;erves for many years.</P>
<P>The Indians, in general, when they eat the &s;agou, u&s;e no other preparation than diluting it in water; but &s;ometimes they dre&s;s it after differ|ent manners: they have the art of &s;eparating the fine&s;t of the flour, and reducing it to little grains, &s;omewhat re&s;embling grains of rice. The &s;agou, thus prepared, is preferred to the other, for the aged and infirm; and is an excellent remedy for many complaints in the &s;tomach. When diluted either in cold or boiling water it forms a whiti&s;h jelly, very agreeable to the ta&s;te.</P>
<P>Though this &s;agou-bearing-palm grows natu|rally in the fore&s;ts, the Malay chiefs have formed con&s;iderable plantations of it, which con&s;titute one of their principal re&s;ources for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>They might have the fine&s;t orchards in the world, would they give them&s;elves the trouble to collect the various plants of tho&s;e excellent fruits
<PB N="44" REF="032696_0023_0FF429378AB58BF0">
which nature has &s;o liberally be&s;towed upon them: we find, however, none but a few &s;traggling trees planted at random around their hou&s;es, or di&s;|per&s;ed over their lands without &s;ymmetry or or|der.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of the great i&s;land of Java have &s;omewhat better ideas of agriculture, than the other Malais, &s;ince their &s;ubjection to the govern|ment of the Dutch. The&s;e &s;overeign merchants have taken advantage of the feudal &s;y&s;tem of the Malais, to reduce them under their yoke; art|fully weakening the regal power, by fomenting, at times, the rebellions of the great va&s;&s;als; and humbling the va&s;&s;als, in their turn, by &s;uccoring their princes, when drove to the brink of ruin.</P>
<P>The Javane&s;e begin to recover from that &s;tate of anarchy, the con&s;equence of their ancient laws now almo&s;t no longer remembered. They cultivate with &s;ucce&s;s, rice, coffee, indigo, and &s;ugar-cane. They rear, on the ea&s;tern coa&s;t of the i&s;land, and in the di&s;tricts of Madur and Solor, in the neighbor|hood, numerous herds of buffaloes, of a mon&s;trous &s;ize: their fle&s;h is excellent, and they are of infi|nite u&s;e in laboring the ground. They have like|wi&s;e numbers of horned cattle, the large&s;t and fine&s;t, perhaps, in the world. The common pa&s;|turage in this, and the re&s;t of the Malay i&s;lands, is the &s;ame gra&s;s I have mentioned under the arti|cle of the I&s;le of France, which the coloni&s;ts there almo&s;t entirely neglect.</P>

<HEAD>PART SECOND.</HEAD>
<P>I LAST year began to give you a &s;ketch of my inquiries into the &s;tate of agriculture among different nations of Africa and A&s;ia. I ob&s;erved that &s;carce a ve&s;tige of it could be traced among&s;t the &s;tupid, the indolent negroes, who inhabit the we&s;tern coa&s;ts of Africa; whil&s;t it flouri&s;hed, under the &s;hade of liberty, among&s;t the Holland|ers at the Cape of Good-Hope. I pointed out the happy abundance which reigned in the fertile i&s;land of Madaga&s;car, inhabited by a people gov|erned by the greate&s;t &s;implicity of manners, and un|acquainted with other laws than tho&s;e of nature. Whil&s;t I did ju&s;tice al&s;o to the &s;y&s;tem of cultivation that prevailed at the I&s;le of Bourbon, which hav|ing no po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t, and of con&s;equence little or no inter|cour&s;e with Europe, the coloni&s;ts have pre&s;erved an uncorrupted &s;y&s;tem of manners, ever favora|ble for agriculture, I was, at the &s;ame time, un|der the nece&s;&s;ity of acknowledging, that this art which requires per&s;everance and &s;implicity, was greatly neglected at the I&s;le of France, which, having two excellent ports, and being much fre|quented by European &s;hips, was more influenced by the incon&s;tant and volatile manners of our quarter of the world; and that, in con&s;equence, though the &s;oil, in point of fertility, was equal to

Madaga&s;car and Bourbon, their harve&s;ts general|ly failed, and an almo&s;t perpetual &s;carcity pre|vailed over the i&s;land.&mdash;I pa&s;&s;ed from thence to the great penin&s;ula of the Indies, where agricul|ture, however oppre&s;&s;ed by the barbarous laws of the Mogul conquerors, is &s;till honored and &s;up|ported by the religion, the manners, and the per|&s;everance of the conquered Malabars.&mdash;At Siam, under the happie&s;t climate, and ble&s;&s;ed with a &s;oil inferior in fertility to no country in the world, agriculture we have ob&s;erved deba&s;ed by the in|dignities of tyranny, and abandoned by a race of &s;laves, whom nothing can intere&s;t, after the lo&s;s of liberty.&mdash;I have repre&s;ented it almo&s;t in the &s;ame condition among&s;t the Malais, who inhabit immen&s;e dominions, and innumerable i&s;lands, where nature has di&s;tributed her choice&s;t trea|&s;ures, and lavi&s;hed her bounties with a profu&s;ion unknown to other regions. The de&s;tructive ge|nius of the feudal laws, which keep this people in a perpetual ferment, permits not their application to the culture of the fine&s;t &s;oil in the world. Nature alone does all. I am convinced that if the other nations of the earth, who have the mi&s;|fortune to be governed by the feudal &s;y&s;tem, in|habited a climate equally happy, and lands equally fertile with tho&s;e of the Malais, their agriculture would be equally neglected: nece&s;&s;ity alone could force the plough into their hands.</P>

With this view, having fir&s;t of all hired a number of labor|ers, &s;ome Chine&s;e, others from the neighboring nations, he, with great addre&s;s, in&s;inuated him|&s;elf into the favor of the mo&s;t powerful princes, who, for a certain &s;ub&s;idy, a&s;&s;igned him a guard for his protection.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of his voyage to Batavia, and the Phillippine I&s;lands, he borrowed from the Euro|peans their mo&s;t u&s;eful di&s;coveries and improve|ments, particularly the art of fortification and de|fence: with regard to internal police, he gave the preference to the Chine&s;e. The profits of his commerce &s;oon enabled him to rai&s;e ramparts, &s;ink ditches, and provide artillery. The&s;e preli|minary precautions &s;ecured him from a coup de main, and protected him from the enterpri&s;es of the &s;urrounding nations of barbarians.</P>
<P>He di&s;tributed the lands to his laborers, with|out the lea&s;t re&s;ervation of any of tho&s;e duties or taxes known by the names of &s;ervice or fines of alienation; duties which, by allowing no real pro|perty, become the mo&s;t fatal &s;courge to agricul|ture, and is an idea which revolts again&s;t the common &s;en&s;e of every wi&s;e nation.

<P>In forming a laboring and commercial people, he thought, that no laws ought to be framed, but

<P>The barbarians of the neighborhood, amazed to &s;ee abundance &s;o &s;uddenly &s;ucceed to &s;terility, flocked for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence to the magazines of Ponthi|amas; who&s;e dominions, at this day, are con&s;id|ered as the mo&s;t plentiful granary of that ea&s;tern part of A&s;ia; the Malais, the Cochin-chine&s;e, the Siame&s;e, who&s;e countries are naturally &s;o fertile, con&s;idering this little territory as the mo&s;t certain re&s;ource again&s;t famine.</P>

<HEAD>Culture of different Kinds of Rice in Cochin-China.</HEAD>
<P>The Cochin-chine&s;e cultivate &s;ix different kinds of rice: the <HI>Little Rice,</HI> the grain of which is &s;mall, oblong and tran&s;parent; this is by far the mo&s;t delicate; it is generally admini&s;tered to the &s;ick: the <HI>Great Long Rice</HI> is that who&s;e form is round: the <HI>Red Rice,</HI> &s;o called becau&s;e the grain is enveloped in a hu&s;k of a reddi&s;h color, which adheres &s;o clo&s;ely, that it requires a very uncom|mon operation to &s;eparate it. The&s;e three kinds are produced in the greate&s;t abundance, and form the principal &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the natives. They require water, it being nece&s;&s;ary to overflow the grounds where they are cultivated.</P>
<P>They rai&s;e al&s;o two other &s;orts of dry rice, which grow in dry &s;oils, and like our wheat, re|quire no other watering but what they receive from the clouds. One of the&s;e &s;pecies of rice has a grain as white as &s;now; when dre&s;&s;ed it is of a &s;limy vi&s;cous &s;ub&s;tance; they make of it different kinds of pa&s;te, &s;uch as vermicelli. Both the&s;e kinds form a con&s;iderable article in their com|merce to China. They cultivate them only on the mountains and ri&s;ing grounds, which they labor with the &s;pade. They &s;ow the&s;e grains as we do wheat, about the end of December or be|ginning of January, when the rainy &s;ea&s;on ends: they are not above three months in the ground and yield a plentiful crop.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="032696_0029_0FF4313D09D2A218">I am induced to believe, that the culture of this valuable grain would &s;ucceed extremely well in France. In the years 1749 and 1750, I often travelled over the mountains of Cochin-china, where this rice is cultivated; they are very high and the temperature of the air cold; in the month of January, 1750, I ob&s;erved that the rice was very green, and above three inches high, altho' the liquor in Reaumur's thermometer was only about four degrees above the freezing point.</P>
<P>I carried &s;ome quintals of this grain to the I&s;le of France, where it was &s;own with &s;ucce&s;s, and produced a greater crop than any other &s;pecies. The coloni&s;ts received my pre&s;ent with the great|e&s;t eagerne&s;s, as, exclu&s;ive of its &s;uperior increa&s;e, it has a finer ta&s;te, is attended with le&s;s trouble, there being no nece&s;&s;ity for overflowing the fields; and, as it ripens fifteen or twenty days &s;ooner than the other kinds, it can be reaped and &s;ecured before the hurricane &s;ea&s;on, which fre|quently makes dreadful havock with their latter harve&s;ts. The other kinds of rice, being of a &s;lower growth, require their grounds to be laid under water, after the manner of the natives of the Coromandel coa&s;t; but our coloni&s;ts pay &s;o little attention to agriculture, that they have never hitherto introduced it.</P>
<P>One might have imagined, that the advanta|ges flowing from the cultivation of dry rice, would have engaged the coloni&s;ts to attend to it with the greate&s;t care; and that, from the I&s;le of
<PB N="57" REF="032696_0029_0FF4313D09D2A218">
France, it might have been with ea&s;e introduced into Europe: but I have in vain endeavored to procure it from this i&s;land; tho&s;e to whom I have applied, have &s;ent me only common rice, which demands water and warmth. The culture of dry rice has, like every other &s;pecies of agricul|ture, been abandoned to the unexperienced igno|rance of &s;laves, who have mixed all the different kinds together, in &s;uch a manner, that the rice of Cochin-china being ripe long before the others, the grains have dropt from the ears before they were reaped, and the &s;pecies, in this manner, has been by degrees, entirely lo&s;t in that i&s;land. Would any traveller, whom bu&s;ine&s;s or curio&s;ity might lead to Cochin-china, &s;end over but a few pounds of this excellent grain, he would de&s;erve our warme&s;t acknowledgments.</P>
<P>The Cochin-chine&s;e cultivate the common rice nearly in the &s;ame manner with the Malabars on the Coromandel coa&s;t.&mdash;After having twice ploughed their ground, they &s;ow the rice in a lit|tle field which has been well labored with the &s;pade; the &s;urface of this little field they ju&s;t cover with water, to the height only of a few lines; and as &s;oon as the rice is about five or &s;ix inches high, they harrow over their large fields, and overflow them with water; then pulling up the rice-plants in the &s;eed-plots, tran&s;plant them into the&s;e grounds, thus prepared, in &s;mall par|cels of four or five &s;talks, about the di&s;tance of &s;ix inches the one from the other. Women and children are generally employed in this work.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="032696_0030_0FF4293E08626C60">The Cochin-chine&s;e have no machine for over|flowing their grounds, nor have they any occa|&s;ion: their plains, from one end of the kingdom to the other, are commanded by a chain of high mountains, plentifully &s;upplied with &s;prings and rivulets, which naturally overflow the grounds, according as their cour&s;e is directed.</P>
<P>They cultivate likewi&s;e different kinds of grain, &s;uch as the mahis millets of different &s;orts, &s;eve|ral &s;pecies of the French bean, potatoes, yams, and a variety of roots proper for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of men and animals. But the culture of mo&s;t im|portant advantage to them, next to the rice, is the &s;ugar-cane; and no country in A&s;ia produces it in greater abundance than Cochin-china.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Sugar-Canes.</HEAD>
<P>The &s;ugar-canes of this country are of two kinds; the fir&s;t grows thick and tall, the joints at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from one another, the color always green, the juice abundant, with very little of the &s;alt in it. This &s;pecies of cane is in general u&s;e for feeding and fattening of cattle; and experience teaches them, that no kind of food fattens &s;ooner or better the human &s;pecies, as well as animals, than this &s;ugar-cane, eat while green, and the &s;ugar which is extracted from it.</P>
<P>The &s;econd &s;pecies is &s;maller in every re&s;pect, with its joints approaching nearer together: when ripe it a&s;&s;umes a yellow color; and contains le&s;s water and more &s;alt than the other.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="032696_0030_0FF4293E08626C60">The Cochin-chine&s;e, when preparing the ground for the &s;ugar-cane, turn it up to the depth of two feet; this operation is performed with a plank. They then plant joints or eyes of the cane, three and three together, in a horizontal po&s;ition, in the &s;ame manner almo&s;t as they plant vines in &s;everal provinces of France. The&s;e &s;lips are planted chequer-wi&s;e about eighteen inches deep in the ground, di&s;tant &s;ix feet from one ano|ther; this operation they perform near the end of the rainy &s;ea&s;on, in order that the &s;lips may be &s;ufficiently watered, till &s;uch time as they have taken root. During the fir&s;t &s;ix months, they give them two dre&s;&s;ings with a kind of pick-axe, in order to de&s;troy the weeds, and pre&s;erve a moi|&s;ture about the roots of the canes, by heaping the earth around them.</P>
<P>Twelve, and &s;ometimes fourteen, months after the plantation, they gather the fir&s;t crop. By this time the canes, though planted at the di&s;tance of &s;ix feet, become &s;o bu&s;hy that it is impo&s;&s;ible to enter the field, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a hatch|et to clear your way.</P>
<P>The canes being cut, and tied up into bundles, are carried to the mills, in order to extract their juice. I &s;hall not here de&s;cribe the form of the&s;e machines, which re&s;emble in a great mea&s;ure tho&s;e of the We&s;t-Indies; in&s;tead of water, they em|ploy horned cattle or mules to &s;et in motion the two cylinders, between which the &s;ugar-canes are pre&s;|&s;ed.
<PB N="60" REF="032696_0031_0FF4313F6F28F7B0">
The&s;e engines have been de&s;cribed by num|bers of travellers.</P>
<P>The juice being extracted, they boil it &s;ome hours in large kettles, in order to evaporate part of its water: it is then tran&s;ported to the neigh|boring market, and &s;old in that condition. Here ends the indu&s;try and the profits of the Cochin-chine&s;e planter. The merchants purcha&s;e the juice, which re&s;embles pure water; they boil it again, throwing into the kettles &s;ome alkaline &s;ub&s;tance, &s;uch as the a&s;hes of the leaves of the mu&s;ia or bananier, and &s;hell-lime; they are ac|quainted with no other; the&s;e ingredients throw up a thick &s;cum, which the refiner carefully &s;kims off, the action of the alkali ha&s;tens the &s;eparation of the &s;alt from the water, and by the force of ebullition, reduces the juice of the cane to the con&s;i&s;tence of &s;yrup. As &s;oon as this &s;yrup be|gins to granulate, they decant it into a great earthen ve&s;&s;el, where they cool it about an hour; when a kind of cru&s;t, &s;till &s;oft, and of a yellowi&s;h color, appears on the &s;urface of the &s;yrup; they lo&s;e not a moment then to empty it into a ve&s;&s;el of a conic &s;hape, which they call a <HI>form.</HI> With|out this intermediate operation of cooling the &s;yrup, it would harden into a ma&s;s, and not being granulated, would con&s;equently want one e&s;&s;en|tial quality of &s;ugar.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;ugar-cones, or forms, in Cochin-china, are, like tho&s;e of our We&s;t-India colonies, of bak|ed earth, about three feet high, pierced at their
<PB N="61" REF="032696_0031_0FF4313F6F28F7B0">
narrow extremities, and contain in general about forty or fifty pounds of &s;ugar. The&s;e <HI>forms,</HI> when full, are placed on another earthen ve&s;&s;el, the mouth of which is proportioned to receive the narrow end of the cone, and mu&s;t be large enough to contain the coar&s;e &s;yrup, which di&s;tils from the &s;ugar, through &s;ome &s;traw which imperfectly &s;tops up the little opening in the bottom of the <HI>form.</HI></P>
<P>When they &s;uppo&s;e the &s;yrup has acquired the con&s;i&s;tence of &s;alt in every part of the cone, they then proceed to whiten and purify it. They di|lute in a trough a fine &s;ort of whiti&s;h clay, with &s;uch a quantity of water as, when thus prepared, prevents it from having too much con&s;i&s;tence; with a trowel they then lay it upon the &s;urface of the &s;ugar to the thickne&s;s of about two inches in the void &s;pace left at the top of the form by the conden&s;ing of the &s;ugar, after purging it&s;elf of the coar&s;er &s;yrup or mola&s;&s;es. The water con|tained in the clay penetrating by degrees into the ma&s;s, wa&s;hes it, and carries off in&s;en&s;ibly the re|maining &s;yrup, and every foreign particle that adheres mo&s;t clo&s;ely to the &s;ugar. When the clay hardens, they replace it with a fre&s;h quanti|ty, diluted as the fir&s;t: this operation, which la&s;ts about twelve or fifteen days, is the &s;ame here as in our We&s;t-India colonies. Some refin|ers of Cochin-china, however, have another method. In place of clay, tempered thus with wa|ter, they cut into &s;mall pieces the trunk of the mu|&s;a or bananier, which they place upon the &s;ugar:
<PB N="62" REF="032696_0032_0FF431425DA6DDB8">
the trunk of this tree is very watery; the water of a detergent quality; and di&s;tils from the fibres which envelope it, in very &s;mall drops. Tho&s;e who follow this method pretend, that the oper|ation is thereby rendered le&s;s tedious, and that the &s;ugar acquires a finer color.</P>
<P>The proce&s;s of the Cochin-chine&s;e, in refining their &s;ugar, goes no further: they are unac|quainted with the &s;toves in u&s;e in the We&s;t-Ind|ies. After having clayed their &s;ugars &s;ufficient|ly, they &s;ell them in the public markets, particu|larly to the Chine&s;e, and other &s;trangers, who are invited to their ports by the moderate price of this commodity, which is cheaper at Cochin-china than any where in India.</P>
<P>The white &s;ugar of the be&s;t quality is general|ly &s;old at the port of Fai&s;o, in exchange for oth|er merchandi&s;e, at the rate of three pia&s;ters (about fourteen &s;hillings) the Cochin-china quin|tal, which weighs from one hundred and fifty, to two hundred pounds French<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ninety-one pounds eight ounces French, make one hundred pounds Engli&s;h.</NOTE>. The trade in this commodity is immen&s;e. The Chine&s;e alone, who&s;e lands do not produce enough for their own con&s;umpt, purcha&s;e annually from Cochin-china above forty thou&s;and barrels, weighing about two thou&s;and pounds per barrel.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="032696_0032_0FF431425DA6DDB8">This country, it &s;hould be ob&s;erved, which produces this commodity in &s;uch abundance, and at &s;o low a price, being a new kingdom, ought to be con&s;idered, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, as a colony: it is worthy ob&s;ervation too, that the &s;ugar-cane is there cultivated by free men, and all the pro|ce&s;s of preparation and refining, the work of free hands. Compare then the price of the Cochin-chine&s;e production with the &s;ame commodity which is cultivated and prepared by the wretch|ed &s;laves of our European colonies, and judge if, to procure &s;ugar from our colonies, it was nece&s;|&s;ary to authori&s;e by law the &s;lavery of the unhap|py Africans tran&s;ported to America.

<P>They cultivate the cotton-tree, the mulberry, the pepper, the varni&s;h-tree, the date, the tea, the in|digo, and the &s;affron, together with a plant pecu|liar to the country, called <HI>T&s;ai,</HI> which being fer|mented like indigo, furni&s;hes in great plenty a flower of a green color, which, in dying, gives a durable tincture of a fine emerald color. This plant would undoubtedly be a mo&s;t valuable pre|&s;ent to our We&s;t-India colonies.</P>

in general are fallow, as population is not even &s;ufficiently con&s;iderable for the cultivation of all the plain grounds they have taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of in Camboya: the&s;e mountains produce, however, the eagle or aloes-wood, which is the mo&s;t pre|cious perfume in the world; the &s;apan-wood, the &s;ame with that of Bra&s;il; and the cinnamon, in &s;mall quantities indeed, but much &s;uperior in quality to that of Ceylon. The Chine&s;e pay three or four times more for it than for that which the Dutch import from that i&s;land. They have &s;ev|eral &s;orts likewi&s;e of admirable wood for joiner and cabinet-work, particularly the ro&s;e-wood; the tea-wood is excellent for building, and is pre|ferred to all others in the con&s;truction of the royal galleys, having every property that can be wi&s;hed for, either for beauty or &s;olidity. From their mountains al&s;o, and from the fore&s;ts with which they are covered, they procure ivory, mu&s;k, wax, iron and gold in great abundance. The&s;e moun|tains too are full of game, &s;uch as deer, antelopes, wild goats, peacocks; phea&s;ants, &amp;c. The chace is free to all, but dangerous from the number of tygers, elephants, rhinoceros, and other carnivo|rous and de&s;tructive animals, with which the for|e&s;ts abound.</P>
<P>The &s;ea, which wa&s;hes their coa&s;ts, as well as the rivers, are well &s;upplied with excellent fi&s;h. Every one has the liberty of fi&s;hing; and in this the Cochin-chine&s;e take great delight. I have already ob&s;erved, that they live chiefly on fi&s;h and rice.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="032696_0034_0FF42943D34E2B50">Their dome&s;tic animals are, the hor&s;e for the road, the buffalo for labor, and the cow, the hog, the goat, the goo&s;e, the duck, and hens of vari|ous kinds, for the table. The&s;e animals thrive extremely well, and are in great abundance. The king alone re&s;erves to him&s;elf the exclu&s;ive right of breeding elephants for the war; and this is a re&s;ervation which no man envies him. He main|tains generally four hundred of them; he could maintain four thou&s;and men at a much le&s;s ex|pen&s;e. The Cochin-chine&s;e have few good fruits; the pine-apple, and oranges of different kinds, are the be&s;t their country produces. They do not cultivate the vine, though it is one of the native productions of their lands. They are but indifferently provided with pul&s;e. In a word, their orchards and their gardens are very incon|&s;iderable. They attach them&s;elves to the more e&s;&s;ential branches of agriculture.</P>
<P>Although this art is not yet arrived at that de|gree of perfection in Cochin-china, to which it might be carried, with the advantage of &s;uch an excellent &s;oil, yet the manners of the people being very favorable, it flouri&s;hes greatly.</P>

curio&s;ity, but, at the &s;ame time, with great bene|volence. I have here remarked a cu&s;tom &s;ingu|lar indeed, but expre&s;&s;ive of their goodne&s;s of heart. A Cochin-chine&s;e traveller, who has not money &s;ufficient to defray his expen&s;es at an inn, enters the fir&s;t hou&s;e of the town or village he arrives at: no body inquires his bu&s;ine&s;s; he &s;peaks to none, but waits in &s;ilence the hour of dinner; &s;o &s;oon as the rice is &s;erved up, he mod|e&s;tly approaches, places him&s;elf at table along with the family, eats, drinks, and departs, with|out pronouncing a &s;ingle word, or any per&s;on's putting to him a &s;ingle que&s;tion: it was enough they &s;aw he was a man, a brother in di&s;tre&s;s; they a&s;ked no further information.</P>
<P>The &s;ix fir&s;t kings, founders of this monarchy, governed the nation as a father governs his family; they e&s;tabli&s;hed the laws of nature alone; they them&s;elves paid the fir&s;t obedience to them. Chiefs of an immen&s;e family of laborers, they gave the fir&s;t example of labor; they honored and encouraged agriculture, as the mo&s;t u&s;eful and honorable employment of mankind. They re|quired from their &s;ubjects only a &s;mall annual free-gift, to defray the expen&s;e of their defen&s;ive war again&s;t their Tonquine&s;e enemies.</P>
<P>This impo&s;ition was regulated, by way of poll|tax, with the greate&s;t equity. Every man, able to labor the ground, paid into the magi&s;trate, on account of the prince, a &s;mall &s;um proportioned to the &s;trength of his con&s;titution, and the vigor of

his arm; and nothing more. It was under their reign, that this nation multiplied &s;o &s;urpri&s;ingly, in con&s;equence of the plenty furni&s;hed by the cul|ture of their fields. Whil&s;t they reigned, the treaties entered into on the banks of the river, which &s;eparates Tonquin from Cochin-china, be|tween the chiefs of their family and tho&s;e who followed them in their retreat, were mo&s;t reli|giou&s;ly ob&s;erved. It is to this reciprocal fidelity that Cochin-china owes its pre&s;ent flouri&s;hing &s;tate with regard to power, population and agriculture. Their &s;ucce&s;&s;or, who now reigns, inherits their goodne&s;s of heart, but has the weakne&s;s to &s;uffer him&s;elf to be governed by his &s;laves. The&s;e have acquired the art of &s;eparating the intere&s;t of the prince from that of his people. They have in&s;pired him with the thir&s;t after per&s;onal riches. The va&s;t quantity of gold which they have dug from the mines, during this reign, has already proved detrimental to indu&s;try and agriculture. In the palace it has been productive of luxury and corruption, its never-failing attendants.</P>
<P>This prince has been in&s;en&s;ibly led to de&s;pi&s;e the &s;imple habitations of his ance&s;tors. He has built a &s;uperb palace, a league in circumference, &s;urrounded by a wall of brick, on the model of that of Pekin. Sixteen hundred pieces of cannon, mounted around the palace, announce to the peo|ple the approaching lo&s;s of their liberties and rights.</P>
<P>He found a nece&s;&s;ity too for a winter palace,
<PB N="69" REF="032696_0035_0FF43146E8EF9188">
a &s;ummer palace, and an autumn palace. The old taxes were by no means &s;ufficient to defray the&s;e expen&s;es; they were augmented; and new impo&s;itions devi&s;ed, which, being no longer vol|untary contributions, could not be levied but by force, and tyrannical oppre&s;&s;ion. His courtiers, who found their intere&s;t in the corruption of their prince, have given him the title of <HI>King of Hea|ven: Vous T&s;oi,</HI> hearing him&s;elf often &s;o &s;tiled, at length thought he might a&s;&s;ume it&mdash;"Why," addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf one day to me, "don't you come oftener to pay your court to the <HI>King of Heaven?</HI>"</P>
<P>The&s;e de&s;igning &s;ycophants, who guard every avenue to the royal ear, have had the addre&s;s to over-awe the ordinary admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice; and, taking advantage of exemption from pun|i&s;hment, have pillaged the laborers, and filled the provinces with oppre&s;&s;ion and di&s;tre&s;s.</P>

<P>In the mid&s;t of all this growing di&s;order, the prince, whole mind has been &s;urpri&s;ed by fawn|ing flatterers, and who alone is ignorant of the villany of tho&s;e around him, &s;till pre&s;erves a re|pect for the manners of his ance&s;tors; he does not indeed, like his forefathers, give an example

<P>I have &s;een him, at the commencement of the new year, pre&s;ide, with all the &s;implicity of his predece&s;&s;ors, at the general a&s;&s;embly of the nation, which is annually held on that day, in the open field, in order to renew the reciprocal oath for ob&s;ervation of the primordial contract, which e&s;tabli&s;hed him father of his people, at the &s;ame time that they inve&s;ted him alone with the pow|er, the noble&s;t indeed of all, of making his people happy.</P>
<P>When he &s;peaks of his &s;ubjects, he calls them &s;till by no other name than that of his children. I have &s;een him too a&s;&s;i&s;t, like a &s;imple individual, in the annual a&s;&s;embly of his family, according to the ancient u&s;age of the nation; an a&s;&s;embly where the mo&s;t aged always pre&s;ide, without re|gard to the dignities of tho&s;e of younger years.

<P>Corruption, it is true, has not yet infected the general body of the people; they &s;till pre&s;erve their primitive manners: it is hitherto confined to the palace, and the capital: its &s;ource, how|ever, is too elevated to prevent its poi&s;oned &s;treams from flowing to the plains. It is from the great that the corruption of a people ever de|rives its origin.</P>

<P>Upon the whole I conclude, from the general corruption which threatens the manners of the Cochin-chine&s;e, that agriculture is on the decline, and that whatever efforts they may make to &s;up|port it, it has now pa&s;&s;ed its meridian, and mu&s;t infallibly degenerate.</P>

<P>I now approach the period of my travels. De|parting from the coa&s;ts of Cochin-china, and di|recting my cour&s;e towards the north-ea&s;t, I pro|ceeded for China, which the Cochin-chine&s;e call,
<PB N="72" REF="032696_0037_0FF4314E1AAD6438">
with great re&s;pect, <HI>Nu&s;e d'ai Ming&mdash;the kingdom of the great Luminary.</HI> After &s;ome days naviga|tion, before there was any appearance of land, I perceived along the horizon a fore&s;t of ma&s;ts, and &s;oon after an innumerable multitude of boats, which covered the &s;urface of the water. The&s;e were thou&s;ands of fi&s;hermen, who&s;e indu&s;|try drew from the deeps &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for numbers. The land now began to ri&s;e to my view; I ad|vanced to the mouth of the river, &s;till amid&s;t crowds of fi&s;hers, throwing out their lines on eve|ry &s;ide. I entered the river of Canton; it is peo|pled like the land; its banks lined with &s;hips at anchor; a prodigious number of &s;mall craft are continually gliding along in every direction, &s;ome with &s;ails, others with oars, vani&s;hing often &s;ud|denly from the &s;ight, as they enter the number|le&s;s canals dug with amazing labor, acro&s;s exten|&s;ive plains, which they water and fertilize. Im|men&s;e fields, covered with all the glory of the harve&s;t, with &s;tately villages ri&s;ing to the eye on every &s;ide, adorn the remoter view, whil&s;t moun|tains, covered with verdure, cut into terra&s;&s;es, and &s;haped into amphitheatres, form the back ground of this noble land&s;cape.</P>
<P>I arrive at Canton, where new &s;ubjects for ad|miration ari&s;e; the noi&s;e, the motion, the croud augments; the water, as well as land, being eve|ry where covered with multitudes. A&s;toni&s;hed at the amazing appearance, I inquire into the num|bers of inhabitants of this city, and &s;uburbs; and after comparing different accounts, find that they
<PB N="73" REF="032696_0037_0FF4314E1AAD6438">
mu&s;t amount at lea&s;t to eight hundred thou&s;and &s;ouls. My &s;urpri&s;e, however, is greatly increa&s;|ed, when I learn, that to the northward of Can|ton, about five leagues up the river, is a village named <HI>Fachan,</HI> which contains a million of in|habitants, and that every part of this great em|pire, extending about &s;ix hundred leagues from north to &s;outh, and as much from ea&s;t to we&s;t, was peopled in the &s;ame proportion.</P>
<P>By what art can the earth produce &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for &s;uch numbers? do the Chine&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;s any &s;e|cret art of multiplying the grain and provi&s;ions nece&s;&s;ary for the nouri&s;hment of mankind? To &s;olve my doubts I traver&s;ed the fields, I introdu|ced my&s;elf among the laborers, who are in gener|al, ea&s;y, polite and affable, with &s;ome &s;hare of learning, and knowledge of the world. I exam|ine, and pur&s;ue them through all their operations, and ob&s;erve that their &s;ecret con&s;i&s;ts &s;imply in manuring their fields judiciou&s;ly, ploughing them to a con&s;iderable depth, &s;owing them in the pro|per &s;ea&s;on, turning to advantage every inch of ground which can produce the mo&s;t incon&s;idera|ble crop, and preferring to every other &s;pecies of culture that of grain, as by far the mo&s;t impor|tant.</P>
<P>This &s;y&s;tem of culture, the la&s;t article except|ed, appears to be the &s;ame that is recommended in all our be&s;t authors, ancient and modern, who have wrote on this &s;ubject; our common labor|ers are acquainted with it; but how much mu&s;t
<PB N="74" REF="032696_0038_0FF4314F9E3D8FD8">
our European farmers be &s;urpri&s;ed, when they are informed, that the Chine&s;e have no meadows, na|tural nor artificial, and have not the lea&s;t concep|tion of fallowing, never allowing their lands the &s;lighte&s;t repo&s;e.</P>
<P>The Chine&s;e laborer would con&s;ider meadows, of every denomination, as lands in a &s;tate of na|ture; they &s;ow their lands all with grain, and give the preference to &s;uch grounds as we gen|erally lay out in meadows, which, lying low, and being properly &s;ituated with re&s;pect to water, are con&s;equently by far the mo&s;t fertile. They affirm, that a field &s;own with grain, will yield as much &s;traw for the nouri&s;hment of cattle, as it would have produced of hay, be&s;ides the addi|tional advantage of the grain for the &s;u&s;tenance of man, of which they can &s;pare too, in plentiful &s;ea&s;ons, a &s;mall portion for the animal crea|tion.</P>
<P>Such is the &s;y&s;tem adhered to from one extrem|ity of their empire to the other, and confirmed by the experience of four thou&s;and years, among&s;t a people, of all the nations in the world, the mo&s;t attentive to their intere&s;t.</P>
<P>That which mu&s;t render this plan of agricul|ture the more inconceivable to Europeans, is the idea of their never allowing their lands to lie one &s;ea&s;on unlabored. Tho&s;e who for &s;ome years have endeavored, with &s;uch public-&s;pirited zeal, to re|animate among&s;t us this neglected art, have con&s;id|ered

<P>This &s;y&s;tem, which appears the mo&s;t plau&s;ible of any they have projected, and is received with the greate&s;t partiality by our farmers, is, never|thele&s;s, contradicted by the con&s;tant experience of the greate&s;t and the mo&s;t ancient land laboring nation in the world, who regard the practice of meadows, and fallowing grounds, as an abu&s;e, de&s;tructive of plenty and population, which are the only important objects of agriculture.</P>

Where any kind of labor can be performed, at a moderate price by men, it is a maxim with them never to employ animals. In con&s;equence of this, the banks of their canals, are cultivated al|mo&s;t to the water's edge; they lo&s;e not an inch of ground: their public roads re&s;emble our foot paths; their canals, however, are infinitely more u&s;eful than high ways: they convey fertility ev|ery where, and furni&s;h the people great part of their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence in fi&s;h.&mdash;There is no compari&s;on between the weight which can be tran&s;ported in a boat, and that which can be conveyed by any kind of land-carriage; no proportion between the expen&s;e.</P>

<P>On the fifteenth day of the fir&s;t moon, in every year, which generally corre&s;ponds to the begin|ning of March, the emperor in per&s;on performs the ceremony of opening the grounds.

<P>The emperor enters the field alone, pro&s;trates him&s;elf, and nine times &s;trikes his head again&s;t the ground, in adoration of <HI>Tien,</HI> the GOD of heaven; he pronounces, with a loud voice, a prayer ap|pointed by the tribunal of rites, invoking the ble&s;&s;ing of the Almighty Sovereign on his labor and on the labor of his people, who form his fam|ily;

he then, in quality of &s;overeign pontiff of the empire, &s;acrifices a bullock, which he offers up to heaven, as the &s;ource of every ble&s;&s;ing: whil&s;t they cut the victim in pieces, and place them on the altar, they bring to the emperor a plough, in which are yoked a pair of bullocks, magnificent|ly adorned. The emperor then, laying a&s;ide his royal robes, takes hold of the handle of the plough, and turns up &s;everal furrows the whole length of the field; then, with a complai&s;ant air, having delivered the plough to the mandarins, they &s;ucce&s;&s;ively follow his example, emulating one another in performing this honorable labor with the greate&s;t dexterity. The ceremony concludes with the di&s;tribution of money, and pieces of &s;tuff, among the laborers there pre&s;ent; the mo&s;t active of whom fini&s;h the remaining labor, in pre&s;ence of the emperor, with great agility and addre&s;s.</P>
