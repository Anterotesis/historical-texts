<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE author of the following letter, has been de&s;ired, by &s;ome of the followers of Mr. Fletcher, to &s;tate in writing his objections to that author's works. But to point out all the ab&s;ur|dities attending &s;uch a mixture of truth and fal&s;e|hood, would require much time and pains. The <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of the letter therefore has, as yet, at|tempted to expo&s;e but one contradiction attending that author's principles. But this, if it be a real contradiction, is &s;ufficient, 'tis pre&s;umed, to con|vince per&s;ons of &s;en&s;e and candor, that Mr. F&mdash;r's writings contain no con&s;i&s;tent &s;cheme of chri&s;tian doctrines.</P>
<P>This letter when fir&s;t written was by no means de&s;igned for the pre&s;s; but only as a letter to a private friend at his own reque&s;t. But as &s;ome to whom it was fir&s;t read, expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire to have it printed; and as it will in this way, be, not only better under&s;tood, but more exten&s;ive|ly read; and as Mr. F&mdash;r's works are rapidly &s;preading among us, and many are ha&s;tily em|bracing his doctrines, the letter is &s;ubmitted to public peru&s;al and examination.</P>
<P>Our able&s;t divines view Mr. F&mdash;r's works as beneath their notice. And tis true, that he is a very ab&s;urd and incon&s;i&s;tent writer. But it is equally true that his writings, being very agree|able to corrupt human nature, are doing much mi&s;chief in &s;ome parts of Long-I&s;land. It is highly nece&s;&s;ary therefore, that &s;ome body take a
<PB N="iv" REF="026710_0003_0FD16315CD260720">
little pains to expo&s;e &s;ome of his ab&s;urdities and incon&s;i&s;tences.</P>
<P>Some perhaps will object that the author of the letter is a young writer, ambitious to excel, and has therefore publi&s;hed this, with a view merely to di&s;play his abilities. That this is not the ca&s;e, he will not undertake to prove with his pen. He means to judge others by their fruits in general; and exctpes thus to be judged him&s;elf.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;e he has publi&s;hed this with no o|ther view than merely to di&s;play his abilities; what then? Will it certainly follow that Mr. F&mdash;r has not contradicted him&s;elf? Or will it certainly follow that the contradiction is too trifling to be worthy of notice?</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to the fir&s;t part of the objection, that the author of the letter is a young writer it may be ob&s;erved, that perhaps he will be found old enough to point out at lea&s;t one grand contra|diction attending Mr. F&mdash;r's principles: And perhaps more if the cau&s;e of religion &s;hould re|quire it. Be&s;ides, if from the following letter, it &s;hall appear that a young writer can point out &s;uch a contradiction of principles in that author's works, what may we not &s;uppo&s;e an old writer could do?</P>
<P>It will be further objected, perhaps, that this letter will offend the followers of Mr. F&mdash;r? If it &s;hould offend any of them, let the impartial judge whether &s;uch will not be offended princi|pally becau&s;e one of their errors of &s;entiment is
<PB N="v" REF="026710_0004_0FD16317AB742D10">
made manife&s;t to them&s;elves and others? And if this &s;hould be the ca&s;e, will they not have rea&s;on to doubt their own pious &s;incerity, in proportion as they may be offended? Let &s;uch read, John iii. 20 and 21. This letter will offend none, tis pre|&s;umed, but &s;uch as are much under the influence of prejudice. And if we mu&s;t not point out and expo&s;e errors for fear of offending &s;uch, all wri|ting and preaching to defend the truth, mu&s;t be laid a&s;ide.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU doubtle&s;s recollect that you lately de&s;ir|ed me to &s;tate to you in writing my objec|tions to Mr. Fletcher's &s;cheme. I beg then you would do me, and your&s;elf the kindne&s;s to read with impartiality, condor, care and attention the following pages:</P>
<P>You may ob&s;erve that this author is bitterly oppo&s;ed to all nece&s;&s;ity in moral matters. One important and e&s;&s;ential principle in his &s;cheme is this, That all ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity either of our do|ing moral evil, or of our being the &s;ubjects of moral evil, is ab&s;olutely incon&s;i&s;tent with our be|ing either blamable or puni&s;hable for &s;uch moral evil: Or in other words; That God cannot, con&s;i&s;tently with his perfections, blame or puni&s;h s for doing or being what we cannot avoid. I will cite &s;ome of his own a&s;&s;ertions to this effect.</P>
<P><Q>And that the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of all human actions is incompatible with a moral law and a day of judgement, is (&s;ays he) an axiom in every prejudiced mind.</Q>
Vol. iii. page 201.
<Q>And con&s;cience declares, that it is unju&s;t and
<PB N="8" REF="026710_0006_0FD1631A6E6643F0">
cruel to inflict fearful, eternal puni&s;hments upon beings that have only moved and acted by ab|&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity.</Q>
Vol. iii. page 206.
<Q>Ab&s;o|lute nece&s;&s;ity and a righteous judgement are ab&s;olutely incompatible.</Q>
Vol. iii. page 206.
<Q>If through the &s;aving grace of God which has appeared to all men, we were not again endu|ed with an awful power to chu&s;e life, and to be faithful, it would be as injudicious to puni&s;h or recompence mankind, as to whip a dead hor&s;e for not moving, damn fire for burning, or grant water an eternal reward for its flui|dity.</Q>
Vol. iii. page 91.
<Q>And when you in&s;inuate, that the lawgiver of the univer&s;e will &s;end all workers of iniquity to hell, for not doing what is lawful and right to &s;ave their &s;ouls alive, or for not avoiding &s;in, when he never gave them the lea&s;t power per&s;onally &s;o to do, you pour almo&s;t as much contempt upon his perfections, as if you &s;aid that he will one day rai&s;e all creeping in&s;ects to judge them ac|cording to their &s;teps, and to ca&s;t into a place of torment as many as did not move as &s;wift as a race hor&s;e.</Q>
Vol. iii. page 92.
<Q>But the &s;cheme which I oppo&s;e, in&s;tead of leaving men without excu&s;e, opens their mouths and fills them with the be&s;t apology in the world. Ab|&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity and complete impo&s;&s;ibility, cau&s;ed by another before we were born. An apology this which no candid per&s;on can ever object to.</Q>
Vol. iii. page 172.</P>
<P>Such you know, Sir, is his language through|out a con&s;iderable part of the third and fourth volumes. And the principle he advances in the places, I have here cited, is a principle upon
<PB N="9" REF="026710_0007_0FD1631BD04A1AE0">
which he lays great &s;tre&s;s, as every one mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible who has ever peru&s;ed this author. In|deed, almo&s;t or quite all his rea&s;oning again&s;t the ab&s;olute decrees of God, the &s;overeignty of grace and the like, is found upon this principle.</P>
<P>You &s;ee then that one important and e&s;&s;ential principle in his &s;cheme is, That all ab&s;olute nece&s;|&s;ity either of our doing moral evil, or of our be|ing the &s;ubjects of moral evil, is ab&s;olutely in|con&s;i&s;tent with our being either blamable or pu|ni&s;hable for &s;uch moral evil: Or, That God cannot, con&s;i&s;tently with his perfections, blame or pu|ni&s;h us for doing or being what we cannot avoid.</P>
<P>Now, Sir, I will endeavour to &s;how, from this author's own words, that another important and e&s;&s;ential part of his &s;cheme is founded upon a principle which is ab&s;olutely incon&s;i&s;tent with the above mentioned principle; and directly contra|dictory to it. The principle upon which this part of his &s;cheme is founded is the following one: That ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of our doing moral evil, or of our being the &s;ubjects of moral evil, is perfectly <HI>con&s;i&s;tent</HI> with our being both blamable and puni&s;hable for &s;uch moral evil: Or in other words; That God <HI>could,</HI> con&s;i&s;tently with his perfections blame and puni&s;h us for doing &s;uch moral evil as we could not avoid. And if I fully and clearly &s;how that one part of Mr F&mdash;r's &s;cheme is founded upon this la&s;t mentioned prin|ciple, I hope you will have candor enough to ac|knowledge that he has ab&s;olutely contradicted him&s;elf, and that one part of his &s;cheme is ab&s;o|lutely incon&s;i&s;tent with the other.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="026710_0008_0FD1631D8818B160">In the fir&s;t place then, he holds that the fall of Adam brought mankind into a &s;tate, in which they could, without a Saviour, have done nothing but moral evil. They mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have gone on in nothing but &s;in and wickedne&s;s. For he undertakes to vindicate what Mr. We&s;ley a&s;|&s;erted (viz.) The total fall of man, and that by nature man's will is only free to evil. See vol. i. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> 16 and 21. And Mr F&mdash;r expre&s;&s;ly &s;ays, that he agrees with Mr. Hill in this;
<Q>That the will of man, con&s;idered as fallen in Adam, and una&s;&s;i&s;ted by the grace of God, is <HI>only free to evil</HI>&mdash;free to live in the element of &s;in, as a &s;ea fi&s;h is only free to live in &s;alt water.</Q>
Vol. ii. page 210. And in another place.
<Q>without him (that is Chri&s;t) we have (&s;ays he) no|thing but helple&s;&s;ne&s;s; we can do nothing but &s;in.</Q>
Vol. ii. page 200. Again.
<Q>The lan|guage of a penitent &s;inner, is (&s;ays he) Lord, I pray and hear, I fa&s;t and receive, I give alms, and keep the Sabbath, but after all I am an umprofitable &s;ervant. I mu&s;t work out my own &s;alvation with fear and trembling, and yet without thee I can do nothing. I cannot change my heart. I cannot root up from my brea&s;t the de&s;ire of prai&s;e, the thir&s;t of plea|&s;ure, and the hankering after gold, vanity, beauty, or &s;en&s;ual gratifications which I conti|nually feel. Without thee I cannot force my &s;tubborn heart to repent, believe and love; to be meek and lowly, calm and devout. Lord deliver me from this body of death; Lord &s;ave or I peri&s;h.</Q>
Vol. iii. page 52. And in another place the author has the&s;e words.
<Q>I prote&s; in oppo&s;ition to Phari&s;aic pride, that we have
<PB N="11" REF="026710_0009_0FD1631ECC9C2640">
no power to do good works plea&s;ant and ac|ceptable to God, without the grace of God preventing us, that we may have a good will, and working with us when we have that good will.</Q>
Vol. iv. page 135. Once more.
<Q>From what has been ob&s;erved it follows (&s;ays he) that before any one can believe in the go&s;pel &s;en&s;e of the word, he mu&s;t be convinced of &s;in by the &s;pirit of God He mu&s;t feel him&s;elf a <HI>guil|ty, lo&s;t,</HI> and <HI>helple&s;s</HI> &s;inner, unable to recover the favour and image of God by his own &s;trength and righteou&s;ne&s;s.</Q>
Vol. iii. page 44.</P>
<P>Many more pa&s;&s;ages of the &s;ame import I could ea&s;ily cite from this author: But the&s;e I tru&s;t are &s;ufficient to &s;how he holds that the fall of Adam brought mankind into a &s;tate in which they could, without a Saviour, have done nothing but moral evil: That they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily and unavoidably have gone on in &s;in and wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd place, this author holds that mankind would have been blamable and puni&s;ha|ble for their nece&s;&s;ary and unavoidable &s;in and wickedne&s;s, had a Saviour never been provided, this appears from his expre&s;&s;ions which I have al|ready cited: Such as the&s;e;
<Q>The will of man con&s;iderered as fallen in Adam, and una&s;&s;i&s;ted by the grace of God, is only free to evil&mdash;free to live in the element of &s;in, as a &s;ea-fi&s;h is only free to live in &s;alt water.</Q>
<Q>Without him (that is Chri&s;t) we have nothing but helple&s;&s;|ne&s;s; we have nothing but &s;in,</Q>
&amp;c. By <HI>evil,</HI> and by <HI>&s;in</HI> and the like here, we are undoubtedly to under&s;tand that for which mankind are blama|ble and puni&s;hable; otherwi&s;e it cannot be <HI>moral evil</HI>: It cannot be <HI>&s;in.</HI> If then without Chri&s;t
<PB N="12" REF="026710_0010_0FD163204DC94FE8">
mankind have nothing but <HI>helple&s;&s;ne&s;s</HI>; nothing but <HI>&s;in,</HI> and their wills be free only to evil and the like, it follows that without a Saviour mankind would <HI>nece&s;&s;arily</HI> and <HI>unavoidably</HI> have been both blamable and puni&s;hable. They would have been, according to what Mr. F&mdash;r holds, under an <HI>ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of going on in &s;in, &s;o as to have been guilty, blamable, and puni&s;hable. And he evidently grants all this in &s;aying that a per&s;on before he believes in the go&s;pel,
<Q>Mu&s;t feel him&s;elf a <HI>guilty, lo&s;t,</HI> and <HI>helple&s;s</HI> &s;inner,</Q>
&amp;c.</P>
<P>But we need not re&s;t the matter here: For in other places he is very full and expre&s;s to the purpo&s;e. He holds that all mankind are, by na|ture and without Chri&s;t, under the fir&s;t covenant made with Adam. And he holds that it is impo&s;|&s;ible for any mere man &s;ince the fall to keep this covenant. At the &s;ame time he holds that all mankind, without Chri&s;t; are under the cur&s;e, children of wrath, and condemned for not keep|ing it.
<Q>This fir&s;t covenant (&s;ays he) we have all broken in our fir&s;t parents; for in Adam all died&mdash;By one man &s;in entered into the world, and death by &s;in, and &s;o death pa&s;&s;ed upon all men, for that all have &s;inned.; Rom. v. 12. We are then all born or conceived in &s;in; P&s;. li. 5. And con&s;equently we are by nature chil|dren of wrath; Eph. ii. 3. But this is not all: This root of original &s;in produces in every man many actual iniquities; whereby we imitate Adams rebellion, &s;o we make the guilt of it our own, and fa&s;ten the <HI>cur&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">tending that guilt, <HI>upon our own &s;ouls.</HI> Rom. vii. 25. There|fore, while we remain in our natural &s;tate, or to &s;peak more intelligibly, while we continue
<PB N="13" REF="026710_0011_0FD16321F5C52AD0">
in &s;in, guilt, and total impenitency, we not <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> trample the covenant of grace under foot, but we <HI>&s;tand upon the covenant of works</HI>; and con&s;equently lie under the dreadful cur&s;e, which is already denounced again&s;t every tran&s;gre&s;&s;or of the law</Q>
Gal. iii 10. Vol. iii. page 40.</P>
<P>Is this then the ca&s;e? Have we all broken the fir&s;t covenant in our fir&s;t parents! Have we all &s;inned in this way? And are we by nature chil|dren of wrath? And does this root of original &s;in produce in every man many actual iniquities, &s;o that we fa&s;ten the <HI>cur&s;e upon our own &s;ouls?</HI> And he under the dreadful cur&s;e which is already denounced again&s;t every tran&s;gre&s;&s;or of the law? Have we all then broken the fir&s;t covenant, and for breaking it are we thus, children of wrath and under the dreadful cur&s;e and the like? Would not all the po&s;terity of Adam then, have been blamable and puni&s;hable for their <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> and <HI>unavoidable</HI> &s;in and wickedne&s;s, had a Saviour never been provided? If Mr. F&mdash;r was now here, how would he avoid this con&s;equence? Does it not inevitably follow from his own premi&s;es? Surely he would not pretend that <HI>Chri&s;t has,</HI> by his coming, brought us under the fir&s;t covenant, and made us thus guilty, blamable and puni&s;hable for breaking it? If he &s;hould pretend this, he would contradict him&s;elf in another particular: For he holds that Chri&s;t came to free us from the fir&s;t covenant, and from the guilt, blame, and con|demnation which we have incurred by breaking it. See vol. iv. page 162. If then Chri&s;t had never come, all the po&s;terity of Adam would have been under an <HI>ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of being <HI>&s;in|ful
<PB N="14" REF="026710_0012_0FD16323D0B11A10">
guilty, blamable, puni&s;hable</HI>; and of being <HI>condemned</HI> for ever.</P>
<P>Equally full and expre&s;s to the purpo&s;e he is in another place.
<Q>Under the fir&s;t covenant, ab|&s;olute, un&s;inning, univer&s;al obedience in our own per&s;ons is (&s;ays he) required; and &s;uch obedience we, in our fallen &s;tate, <HI>can never perform.</HI></Q>
Vol. iii. page 43. But &s;urely God does not require more of us than he can ju&s;tly blame and puni&s;h us for not doing. It would be bla&s;phemy to &s;uppo&s;e that he does: For it would be nothing le&s;s than &s;uppo&s;ing him to require more than he ought to require or could ju&s;tly require. It follows then, that had a Saviour never been provided, God could ju&s;tly, and in fact would have blamed and puni&s;hed mankind for their <HI>ne|ce&s;&s;ary</HI> and <HI>unavoidable</HI> guilt, and wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P>Once more,
<Q>The &s;econd covenant or the go&s;pel is (he tells in another place) a di&s;|pen&s;ation of free grace and mercy to <HI>poor, lo&s;t, helple&s;s &s;inners,</HI> who &s;eeing and feeling them|&s;elves <HI>condemned</HI> by the law of innocence; and <HI>utterly unable</HI> to <HI>obtain ju&s;tification</HI> upon the terms of the <HI>fir&s;t covenant,</HI> come to Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</Q>
&amp;c. Vol. iii. page 42. Here then I a&s;k what would the&s;e have done if no Saviour had been pro|vided? Mu&s;t they not <HI>nece&s;&s;arily</HI> and <HI>unavoidably</HI> have been condemned by the law of innocence? And mu&s;t not this condemnation have <HI>nece&s;&s;arily</HI> and <HI>unavoidably</HI> come upon all the fallen race of Adam?</P>
<P>Again:
<Q>Total death, or a full departure of the Holy Spirit. This (&s;ays Mr. F&mdash;r) pa&s;&s;ed upon Adam <HI>and all mankind in him,</HI> when he lo&s;t God's moral image; fell into &s;elfi&s;h na|ture,
<PB N="15" REF="026710_0013_0FD16324CD3C61C8">
and was buried in &s;in, guilt, &s;hame and horror.</Q>
Vol. i. page 259. According to this author, therefore, &s;piritual death pa&s;&s;ed upon all mankind in Adam when he lo&s;t God's moral im|age. And thus judgement came upon all men to condemnation; &s;o that even infants mu&s;t be ju&s;ti|fied by Chri&s;t or be damned. We therefore find him &s;peaking of the ju&s;tification which pa&s;&s;es up|on infants, thus;
<Q>That which pa&s;&s;es upon all infants univer&s;ally, and is thus de&s;cribed by St. Paul; as by the offence of one judgement came upon <HI>all</HI> men to condemnation; even &s;o by the righteou&s;ne&s;s of one, the free gift came upon all men, unto ju&s;tification from original &s;in.</Q>
&amp;c. Vol. i. page 263. And in another place, &s;peaking re&s;pecting the four degrees of ju&s;tifica|tion, he has the&s;e words re&s;pecting that which pa&s;&s;es upon us in our infancy.
<Q>All the&s;e de|grees of ju&s;tification are equally merited by Chri&s;t. We do nothing in order to the fir&s;t, becau&s;e it finds us in a &s;tate of total death.</Q>
Vol. i. page 264.</P>
<P>But infants could not &s;tand in need of this ju&s;|tifitation by Chri&s;t if they were not <HI>guilty, bla|mable</HI> and <HI>puni&s;hable.</HI> It follows then that if Chri&s;t had never come and merited the&s;e degrees of ju&s;|tification, the very infants mu&s;t have been blama|ble, puni&s;hable and condemned. But could in|fants have prevented the offence of their fir&s;t pa|rent Adam? It will not be pretended It fol|lows then that, if a Saviour had never been pro|vided, all the po&s;terity of Adam, who might have died in their very <HI>infancy</HI> would have been under an <HI>ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of being, <HI>guilty, bla|mable</HI> and <HI>puni&s;hable.</HI> Nay, all &s;uch mu&s;t accord|ing
<PB N="16" REF="026710_0014_0FD163264D03A658">
to Mr. F&mdash;r, have nece&s;&s;arily been con|demned forever. This is going a great &s;tretch indeed. This author ought to blu&s;h at mention|tioning even the name of "Rigid calvini&s;ts." For I tru&s;t there are few who will equal <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> in ri|gidne&s;s with regard to this matter.</P>
<P>Does it not appear then that all the po&s;terity of Adam would, according to Mr. F&mdash;r, have been <HI>blamable</HI> and <HI>puni&s;hable</HI> for their <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> and <HI>unavoidable</HI> guilt, and wickedne&s;s? I could ea&s;ily produce many more of his a&s;&s;ertions of the &s;ame import. But the&s;e I tru&s;t are amply &s;uffici|ent to &s;how that, according to this author, God could ju&s;tly have blamed and puni&s;hed mankind for &s;uch &s;in, guilt and wickedne&s;s as they could not po&s;&s;ibly have avoided, in ca&s;e a Saviour had never been provided. All the po&s;terity of Adam would have been under an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of be|ing guilty, and con&s;equently of being condemned.</P>
<P>But how does all this agree with the fir&s;t men|tioned principle of his (viz.) that
<Q>Ab&s;olute ne|ce&s;&s;ity and a righteous judgement are ab&s;olute, incompatible,</Q>
and the like: Or which I take to be the &s;ame thing, that ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity either of our doing moral evil, or being the &s;ubjects of moral evil, is ab&s;olutely incon&s;i&s;tent with our being either blamable or puni&s;hable for &s;uch moral evil. If I can under&s;tand language here is an expre&s;s and manife&s;t contradiction in the&s;e two principles belonging to Mr. F&mdash;r's &s;cheme. And, Sir, how does he help him&s;elf out of this dilemma? How does he free his &s;cheme from this entanglement? Will you &s;ay he holds that God has provided a <HI>Saviour,</HI> and by him freed all the po&s;|terity of Adam from this ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of &s;in|ning,
<PB N="17" REF="026710_0015_0FD163282AC80AA8">
of being guilty, blamable and puni&s;hable, and of being condemned? I grant it. He does hold to this. We therefore find him expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf in the following manner:</P>
<P><Q>Every anti Calvini&s;t may, and I for one do believe, that in every man born into the world, and con&s;idered according to the fir&s;t covenant, <HI>original</HI> corruption, (nor Adam's tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion) <HI>de&s;erves God's wrath and damnation</HI> at the hands of an holy and righteous God, without dreaming that any man &s;hall ever be damned for it: See|ing that according to God's mercy and good|ne&s;s di&s;played in the &s;econd covenant. Chri&s;t the &s;econd Adam, is come to ta&s;te death for every man and to be a Saviour of all men; &s;o that for his &s;ake the free gift is come upon all men unto ju&s;tification of life.</Q>
Vol. ii. page 245.</P>
<P>It &s;eems then that <HI>original corruption</HI> in every man born into the world, and con&s;idered accord|ing to the fir&s;t covenant, <HI>de&s;erves,</HI> (according to this author's own words) God's wrath and dam|nation at the hands of an holy and righteous God. But is it po&s;&s;ible for Adam's po&s;terity to <HI>avoid o|riginal corruption?</HI> He does not pretend it. Why then may not the po&s;terity of Adam be, not only blamable and puni&s;hable, but damned for what they could not po&s;&s;ibly, avoid? Becau&s;e,
<Q>Chri&s;t the &s;econd Adam (&s;ays Mr. F&mdash;r) is come to ta&s;te death for every man, and to be a Saviour of all men; &s;o that for his &s;ake the free gift is come upon all men unto ju&s;tification of life</Q>
This is his &s;olution of the difficulty. Let us then pay particular attention to it. Let us carefully
<PB N="18" REF="026710_0016_0FD163294D93BD10">
examine this an&s;wer and &s;ee whether it is really helping the matter.</P>
<P>Here then let it be ob&s;erved, that Mr. F&mdash;r holds that the gift of a Saviour was a <HI>free gift</HI> as in the words ju&s;t cited from him. And you, Sir, know very well I tru&s;t, that he holds to the &s;ame throughout his writings. He holds that the gift of a Saviour was a <HI>free gift</HI> and <HI>wholly of free grace.</HI> He holds that the capacity which Chri&s;t has given all mankind to repent and chu&s;e life, and that the power which Chri&s;t has given all mankind to believe and repent; and that the day of &s;alvation, with a talent of living light, and rectified free agency and the like, are all of <HI>free grace.</HI> I could produce a great variety of his own a&s;&s;ertions to prove what I here a&s;&s;ert. But it is needle&s;s for no one, who has ever peru&s;ed this author, will, I pre&s;ume, pretend to deny that he holds all mankind have the&s;e favours of <HI>free grace.</HI></P>
<P>If then the gift of a Saviour be a <HI>free gift</HI> and <HI>wholly of free grace,</HI> it follows that God was un|der no <HI>obligations</HI> to give us Chri&s;t; nor any of the ble&s;&s;ings which flow to us through him. Con|&s;equently he might ju&s;tly have with-held the gift of a Saviour, and all the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings from mankind, and left them in their fallen condition. And then what would have been the condition of mankind? All the po&s;terity of Adam would have been un|der <HI>an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of being totally corrupt, and of going on in &s;in and wickedne&s;s. And they would, according to what Mr. F&mdash;r tells us, have de&s;erved God's wrath and damnation even for their <HI>original corruption.</HI> And &s;urely they
<PB N="19" REF="026710_0017_0FD1632ACD8DBA00">
would have de&s;erved as much as this for their ac|tual tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of the law of innocence.</P>
<P>Does this author then help the matter in this way? No per&s;on of &s;en&s;e and candor will &s;uppo&s;e it: For according to his own principles, God might ju&s;tly have <HI>with-held</HI> the gift of a Saviour and all free grace. And if &s;o, it follows that every man born into the <HI>world</HI> would have de|&s;erved God's wrath and damnation even for that <HI>original corruption</HI> which they <HI>could not po&s;&s;ibly have avoided; but mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily</HI> have had. And be&s;ides their original corruption they would have had many actual iniquities. And mo&s;t certainly the&s;e would have de&s;erved as much as their ori|ginal corruption.</P>
<P>But how does the&s;e things harmonize with this author's favorite principle, that,
<Q>Ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity and a righteous judgment are ab&s;olute|ly incompatible?</Q>
And how do they harmo|nize with the following a&s;&s;ertion of his:
<Q>If, through the &s;aving grace of God which has appeared to all men, we were not again endu|ed with an awful power to chu&s;e life, and to be faithful, it would be as in&s;idious to puni&s;h or recompen&s;e mankind, as to whip a dead hor&s;e for not moving, damn fire for burning, or grant water an eternal reward for its fluidity.</Q>
Let candor and common &s;en&s;e judge whether here be not a mo&s;t awful jaring of principles. Does not Mr. F&mdash;r hold to two principles which mu&s;t be at eternal war with each other?</P>
<P><Q>We oppo&s;e (&s;ays he) the doctrine of ab&s;o|lute nece&s;&s;ity, or the Calvinian mu&s;t as being in&s;eparable from Manichei&s;m; and we a&s;&s;ert that there is no <HI>needs mu&s;t</HI> in the eternal

death of any man; becau&s;e Chri&s;t im|parts a degree of temporary &s;alvation to all, with power to obey, and a promi&s;e to be&s;tow eternal &s;alvation upon all that will obey.</Q>
Vol. iv. page 88.</P>
<P>From what this author here &s;ays it &s;eems that the <HI>rea&s;on</HI> why there is no
<Q><HI>Needs mu&s;t</HI> in the eternal death of any man,</Q>
is the <HI>coming of Chri&s;t</HI> and imparting a degree of temporary &s;al|vation to all with power to obey and a promi&s;e to be&s;tow eternal &s;alvation upon all that will obey. This, as well as what he &s;ays otherwhere, implies that if Chri&s;t had never come, there <HI>would</HI> have been a "<HI>Needs mu&s;t</HI>" in the eternal death of &s;ome. It implies that there <HI>would</HI> have been a "<HI>Needs mu&s;t</HI>" in the eternal death of all Adam's po&s;terity. But as the gift of Chri&s;t was, as Mr. F&mdash;r allows, a <HI>free gift</HI> and of <HI>free grace,</HI> God was under no <HI>obligations</HI> to give us Chri&s;t, or to provide any Saviour for mankind. Con&s;e|quently he might <HI>ju&s;tly have with-held</HI> the gift of a Saviour, and left mankind with a <HI>needs mu&s;t</HI> in the eternal death of every one of Adam's po&s;ter|ity; and of all mankind after the &s;ail. Does not this author then oppo&s;e <HI>him&s;elf</HI> in oppo&s;ing the doctrine of Ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity?
<Q>We mu&s;t re|nounce the mi&s;takes of rigid Calvini&s;ts, (&s;ays he) or give up the doctrines of ju&s;tice.</Q>
It appears to me as though &s;ome of the followers of Mr. F&mdash;r mu&s;t renounce &s;ome of his mi&s;|takes, or give up the doctrine of <HI>perfection.</HI></P>
<P>In &s;hort; according to <HI>one part</HI> of this author's &s;cheme, the great nece&s;&s;ity of a Saviour to man|kind, ari&s;es from their being under an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of &s;inning, of being guilty, blamable,
<PB N="21" REF="026710_0019_0FD1632E064DEFF8">
peri&s;hable and condemned forever without one. So that not only the nece&s;&s;ity, but even the grace of the go&s;pel to Adam's po&s;terity, is founded up|on this <HI>very &s;uppo&s;ition</HI> that God might ju&s;tly have blamed and puni&s;hed his creatures, for doing that which they would have been under an ab&s;o|lute nece&s;&s;ity of doing; and for being what they would have been under an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of being. At the &s;ame time this writer has founded <HI>another important part</HI> of his &s;cheme upon the <HI>&s;uppo&s;ition</HI> or <HI>principle,</HI> That God cannot, and never could in any ca&s;e, con&s;i&s;tently with his per|fections, blame or puni&s;h his creatures for doing or being what they could not avoid.</P>
<P>Does then this author help the matter in the lea&s;t by &s;aying, that God has freely given to man|kind a Saviour, to free them from that ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of &s;inning, and of peri&s;hing <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> they would otherwi&s;e have been under? On the con|trary; Does he <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> make the matter wor&s;e? Does not the very gift of a Saviour &s;how that all the po&s;terity of Adam were in a <HI>lo&s;t, helple&s;s,</HI> and <HI>undone</HI> condition? Does not the gift of a Saviour prove that they <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> po&s;&s;ibly</HI> have avoided &s;in go <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> blame and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> without one?

that, in this way, he has, if po&s;&s;ible, entangled it the more.</P>
<P>And indeed he him&s;elf appears to have been in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;en&s;ible of the impo&s;&s;ibility of re|conciling his jaring principles in this way. We therefore find him quitting this ground, and hav|ing recour&s;e to another expedient. But let us follow him.</P>
<P><Q>And we a&s;&s;ert (&s;ays he in Vol. iv. page 38) that if God had not graciou&s;ly de&s;igned to re|place all mankind in a &s;tate of initial &s;alvation from &s;in and hell, according to the various di&s;|pen&s;ations of his redeeming grace, he would have puni&s;hed Adam's &s;in by a per&s;onal damna|tion. Nor would he have &s;uffered him to propagate his fallen race, unle&s;s the &s;econd Adam had extended the ble&s;&s;ings of redemption &s;o far as to &s;ave from eternal mi&s;ery all who die in their infancy; and to put all who live long enough to act as moral agents, in a capa|city of avoiding hell by working out their own eternal &s;alvation in the day of their temporary &s;alvation; a day this, which incon&s;i&s;tent Cal|vini&s;ts call the day of grace.</Q></P>
<P>Here is &s;omething extraordinary indeed for one who has boa&s;ted of his talents at rea&s;oning as Mr. F&mdash;r. Here we &s;ee him, &s;o far from &s;tanding his ground, that he is evidently giving way to this grand difficulty attendending his &s;cheme. He tells us that if a Saviour had not been provided, God would not have &s;uffered Adam to propagate his fallen race 'Tis as much as if he had &s;aid; God <HI>could</HI> con&s;i&s;tently with his perfections, have &s;uffered Adam to propagate his race in &s;uch a &s;tate that they might have been un|der
<PB N="23" REF="026710_0021_0FD16330D39A20A0">
an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of being &s;inful, guilty, blamable and ju&s;tly puni&s;hable, had a Saviour ne|ver been provided: But I do not believe he <HI>would</HI> have &s;uffered it. This is granting that God could ju&s;tly have blamed and puni&s;hed Adam's po&s;terity for doing that which they could not po&s;|&s;ibly have avoided; and for being &s;uch creatures as they would have been under an ab&s;olute nece&s;|&s;ity of being. But how does this agree with the following a&s;&s;ertion of his:
<Q>If, through the &s;a|ving grace of God which has appeared to all men, we were not again endued with an aw|ful power to chu&s;e life, and to be faithful, it would be as injudicious to puni&s;h or recom|pen&s;e mankind, as to whip a dead hor&s;e for not moving, damn fire for burning, grant water an eternal reward for its fluidity.</Q>
In &s;hort, how does this agree with a principle upon which he has founded an important part of his &s;cheme, (viz.) that "Ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity and a righteous judgment are ab&s;olutely incompatible?"</P>
<P>But perhaps, Sir, you will &s;ay that Mr. F&mdash;r's meaning here was not that God <HI>could,</HI> but that he <HI>could not,</HI> con&s;i&s;tently with his perfections, have &s;uffered Adam thus to propagate his fallen race without providing a Saviour? Then it comes to this, that God, as &s;oon as he &s;uffered Adam to propagate his fallen race, was under <HI>obligations</HI> to provide a Saviour for all his po&s;terity. But if &s;o, how was the gift of a Saviour to mankind a purely free and gracious gift? It certainly was not, according to this, wholly of a free grace to Adams po&s;terity</P>
<P>But as Mr. F&mdash;r holds that the gift of a Saviour was a free gift and a purely gracious gift
<PB N="24" REF="026710_0022_0FD163324C866FA8">
to all mankind; it follows that God might, con|&s;i&s;tently with his ju&s;tice and all his other attri|butes, have &s;uffered Adam to propagate his fallen race, without ever providing any Saviour for them. And then all the po&s;terity of Adam would have been left under the fir&s;t covenant: Accord|ing to which
<Q>An ab&s;olute, un&s;inning, univer&s;al obedience in our own per&s;ons is required; and &s;uch obedience, we in our fallen &s;tate, (&s;ays this author) can never perform.</Q>
Suppo&s;e then God had never provided a Saviour, what would have been our condition? We &s;hould, if what he <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> be true, have been required by the Deity to perform that in our own per&s;ons which we never could have performed: Nay, all the po&s;terity of Adam would have de&s;erved God's wrath and damnation even for their original corruption And this they could not po&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters"> have avoided, &s;ince it would have been brought upon them by their fir&s;t parent Adam. Would not all the po&s;terity of Adam then, have been upon Mr F&mdash;r's principles, ju&s;tly blamable, puni&s;hable and damnable for that which they could not po&s;&s;ibly have avoided? Let rea&s;on, candor and common &s;en&s;e judge. I once more then a&s;k with what appearance of con|&s;i&s;tency or propriety he could a&s;&s;ert thus.
<Q>If through the &s;aving grace of God which has ap|peared to all men, we were not <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> endued with an awful power to chu&s;e life, and to be faithful, it would be as injudicious to puni&s;h or recompen&s;e mankind, as to whip a dead hor&s;e for not moving, dam<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> fire for burning, or grant water an eternal reward for its flui|dity?</Q>
Or with what prop<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="5 letters"> could <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> a&s;&s;ert, that
<Q>Ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity and a righteous judg|ment
<PB N="25" REF="026710_0023_0FD16333CC5DA640">
are ab&s;olutely incompatable?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Thus, (&s;ays this writer, Vol. ii. page 245) by looking at our divine compa&s;s, the word of God, we <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> through the &s;traits of error, keeping at an equal di&s;tance from the rocks a|gain&s;t which Calvini&s;ts run on the right hand, and Pelagians on the left.</Q>
From Mr. F&mdash;r's &s;teerage through the &s;traits of error, one would &s;uppo&s;e he looked at his divine compa&s;s blindfold|ed: For he has made a very crooked path; and is in my humble opinion, taken up by a rock at la&s;t. And over this rock, I pre&s;ume, he will never run. Sir, do you not think, that this au|thor ought fir&s;t to have ca&s;t the beam out of his own eye, before he had undertaken to pull the mote out of other peoples eyes? That is; ought he not to have reconciled Mr. F&mdash;r with Mr. F&mdash;r, before he had undertaken to reconcile the Calvini&s;ts and Arminians by endeavoring to per&s;uade them to embrace his plan.</P>
<P>What has this author &s;aid to extricate him&s;elf from this dilemma? I can find nothing. From his having recour&s;e fir&s;t to one &s;olution of the difficulty and then to another, 'tis evident he felt his &s;cheme in di&s;tre&s;s. He did not fall into this grand incon&s;i&s;tency by mere inattention. He was nece&s;&s;arily and unavoidably driven to it, in ca&s;e he held the free grace of the go&s;pel and his favorite principle, that
<Q>Ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity and a righteous judgment are ab&s;olutely incompati|ble:</Q>
For if, in &s;upporting this principle, he had been con&s;i&s;tent with him&s;elf throughout his writings, he mu&s;t have &s;aid, at all times, that God could never, if a Saviour had not been
<PB N="26" REF="026710_0024_0FD163354E0C6B98">
provided, have required more of the po&s;terity of Adam, than they could have done. And if &s;o; they might have obtained righteou&s;ne&s;s by the law: For they could have done what they could. And, upon this principle, God could have required no more. And
<Q>If there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteou&s;ne&s;s. (&s;ays the Apo&s;tle) &s;hould have been by the law.</Q>
Gal. iii 21. And,
<Q>If righteou&s;ne&s;s come by the law, then Chri&s;t is dead in vain.</Q>
Gal. ii. 21. Thus to all Adam's po&s;terity Chri&s;t would have been dead in vain. This con&s;equence would have been mani|fe&s;t to the mo&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, if this author had been con&s;i&s;tent with him&s;elf with regard to his favorite principle: Nay more; he mu&s;t have expre&s;&s;ly contradicted his fir&s;t go&s;pel axiom that
<Q>All our &s;alvation is of God in Chri&s;t, and there|fore of grace.</Q>
Upon this principle, our &s;al|vation would not have been in Chri&s;t; and at the &s;ame time of grace: For all the po&s;terity of A|dam could have di&s;charged the whole of their du|ty without Chri&s;t. Con&s;equently, they could have obtained &s;alvation without Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>If, on the other hand, this author had univer|&s;ally granted moral nece&s;&s;ity to be con&s;i&s;tant with blame and puni&s;hment, prai&s;e and reward, then he would had little or no room left to object a|gain&s;t the ab&s;olute decrees of God, the &s;ove|reignty of grace and the like. His prejudices therefore again&s;t the truth led him to contradict him&s;elf; and adopt two principles, both of which are e&s;&s;ential to his &s;cheme, and yet at eternal war with each other. This then is your much boa&s;t|ed

of Mr. F&mdash;r with all his triumphing and parade of learning.</P>
<P>I have not attempted to point out but <HI>one</HI> con|tradiction in this author's works. And if any per&s;on will &s;how me that here is not a contradic|tion; then I will &s;how him a number of places in which he his in fact contradicted both him&s;elf and the &s;criptures. But I &s;uppo&s;e it would not trouble in the lea&s;t, tho&s;e who agree with Mr. F&mdash;r, if I were to point out a thou&s;and con|tradictions in his works. For

See vol. iii. page 241. No wonder then that this writer holds to oppo&s;ite doctrines in &s;upport|ing the go&s;pel. Indeed he is perfectly right if this be the ca&s;e: If there be oppo&s;ite doctrines in the go&s;pel he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily hold to oppo&s;ite doctrines, if he mean to &s;upport the go&s;pel. But Sir, what &s;ort of a go&s;pel is Mr. F&mdash;. endeavoring to &s;upport? He calls it <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s go&s;|pel.

<P>There are two general kinds of nece&s;&s;ity a<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> inability.

And we readily grant that &s;uch an <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">+ability and &s;uch a nece&s;&s;ity are ab&s;olutely incon+&s;i&s;tent with commands and prohibitions, prai<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> and blame, rewards and puni&s;hments.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="026710_0027_0FD1633A919CD5B8">The other kind of nece&s;&s;ity and inability is called <HI>moral</HI>; becau&s;e it has reference to the heart or will, which is the moral faculty. To illu&s;trate this, let us &s;uppo&s;e a per&s;on &s;hould be commanded to do an action which he could not do; not for want of bodily powers, under&s;tand|ing or any natural faculty, but wholly for want of a <HI>will</HI> or heart to do it. This per&s;on would be under a moral nece&s;&s;ity of not doing this ac|tion. His inability to do it would be wholly of the moral kind. Thus,
<Q>They that are in the fle&s;h (that is, in an unregenerate &s;tate) cannot plea&s;e God.</Q>
Rom. viii. 8. But why? Is it for want of bodily powers, or any natural facul|ty? No; but only for want of a will to plea&s;e him. Their inability, therefore, to plea&s;e God is wholly of the <HI>moral</HI> kind. And if God &s;hould give the&s;e per&s;ons a will to love him, &s;o as to plea&s;e him, and &s;hould maintain this will in them, they would be under a <HI>moral nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of loving and plea&s;ing God.</P>
<P>This <HI>moral</HI> kind of nece&s;&s;ity and inability may be as ab&s;olute as the <HI>natural.</HI> And in many re&s;|pects it re&s;embles the <HI>natural</HI> kind. But it is ve|ry different in its nature. For the mo&s;t <HI>ab&s;olute moral</HI> nece&s;&s;ity and inability are perfectly con&s;i&s;t|ent with commands and prohibitions, prai&s;e and blame, rewards and puni&s;hments: Whereas, <HI>na|tural</HI> nece&s;&s;ity and inability are ab&s;olutely incon|&s;i&s;tent with the&s;e things.</P>
<P>That ab&s;olute <HI>moral</HI> nece&s;&s;ity and inability are perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with prai&s;e and reward, ap|pears from the &s;tate of the Deity: For the &s;crip|ture expre&s;&s;ly declares that God cannot lie; and that the judge of all the earth cannot but do right.
<PB N="30" REF="026710_0028_0FD1633A97501808">
His will is perfectly holy. And he cannot have any other but a holy will. Con&s;equently, he is under an ab&s;olute <HI>moral</HI> nece&s;&s;ity of being holy. But no one, I pre&s;ume, will pretend to &s;ay that God is not worthy of prai&s;e and reward for his holine&s;s. It follows then that the mo&s;t ab&s;olute moral nece&s;&s;ity to do good, is perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with prai&s;e and reward. The &s;ame appears from a con&s;ideration of the &s;tate of holy men and an|gels in Heaven. And from the &s;ame con&s;idera|tion it appears that ab&s;olute moral nece&s;&s;ity to do good, and ab&s;olute moral inability to do evil, are con&s;i&s;tent with commands and prohibitions: For though &s;aints and angels in Heaven are under an ab&s;olute moral nece&s;&s;ity of being holy, and an ab&s;o|lute moral inability to do evil, yet they are all &s;ub|jects of commands and prohibitions. This is plain from the general tennor of &s;cripture.</P>
<P>That ab&s;olute moral nece&s;&s;ity to do good, &s;o as to per&s;evere in holine&s;s, is con&s;i&s;tent with prai&s;e and reward; commands and prohibitions, might be proved al&s;o from the &s;tate of tho&s;e who are regenerated. For, "Who&s;oever is born of God doth not commit &s;in; (&s;ays the apo&s;tle John) for his &s;eed remaineth in him: And he cannot &s;in be|cau&s;e he is born of God." But, Sir, if you will not allow this argument to be conclu&s;ive, you cannot deny but that I have mentioned &s;ome which are conclu&s;ive with regard to this matter.</P>
<P>Since then ab&s;olute <HI>moral</HI> nece&s;&s;ity to do <HI>good</HI> is perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with commands and prohi|bitions, prai&s;e and reward, why &s;hould not ab&s;o|lute <HI>moral</HI> nece&s;&s;ity to do <HI>evil,</HI> be con&s;i&s;tent with commands and prohibitions, blame and puni&s;h|ment? No rea&s;on I pre&s;ume can be given. But
<PB N="31" REF="026710_0029_0FD1633C0C9C0700">
there is no need of re&s;ting the matter here: For the arguments to prove this fact are various, and &s;uch as amount, I conceive to ab&s;olute demon&s;tra|tion. I will mention two or three; of which I de&s;ire particular notice may be taken.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place then. All, I pre&s;ume, will agree to the following propo&s;itions. God com|mands all mankind to render at all times univer&s;al obedience to the law we are under; to live and the entirely free from &s;in And he con&s;iders us blamable and puni&s;hable for every tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, however &s;mall. But for want of good hearts all mankind cannot thus render at all times, univer&s;al obedience. Notwith&s;tanding all Chri&s;t has done, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for all mankind to live and die mo|ral agents without tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the law they are under &s;ome time or other It follows then that ab&s;olute moral nece&s;&s;ity to do <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> is con&s;i&s;tent with commands, with blame and puni&s;hment. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> inevitably follows, if there be, or ever has been a &s;ingle individual of mankind thus under nece&s;&s;ity from an evil heart, of tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ing at any time, in any in&s;tance, the law he is or was under, whether that be the law of li|berty, the Mo&s;aic or Adamic law. Indeed, it is &s;o far from being the ca&s;e that <HI>all</HI> mankind can thus live and die without &s;inning, that <HI>no mere</HI> man &s;ince the la&s;t ever has been or ever will be <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> notwith&s;tanding all Chri&s;t has done, thus to render univer&s;al obedience from the time he be|came or &s;hall become a moral agent to the time of his death All, on account of evil <HI>hearts,</HI> do <HI>nece&s;&s;arily</HI> and <HI>unavoidably</HI> &s;in &s;ooner or later. This is a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> evident from &s;cripture. And it is what Mr. F&mdash;r him&s;elf allows in a great
<PB N="32" REF="026710_0030_0FD1633E1FB5E3B0">
variety of places, as every one mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible who has ever read his works. It appears then to a demon&s;tration that moral nece&s;&s;ity to do evil, and moral inability to do good, are perfectly con|&s;i&s;tent with commands and prohibitions, blame and puni&s;hment. The &s;ame appears from a con&s;ider|ation of the &s;tate of the devils and damned, and of tho&s;e who are given up to a reprobate mind: For they are all blamable and puni&s;hable, not on|ly for the &s;ins which brought them into that &s;tate, but al&s;o for tho&s;e which they now commit; and which they are under an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of committing. From a great variety of &s;uch argu|ments and from many expre&s;s pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture to this effect that, "They that are in the fle&s;h cannot plea&s;e God," and that many cannot, like the apo&s;tle, do the things that they would and ought to do; 'tis evident that ab&s;olute moral ne|ce&s;&s;ity to do evil, and ab&s;olute moral inability to do good, are perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with commands and prohibitions, blame and puni&s;hment. The &s;ame then we may &s;afely lay down as an eternal maxim of truth abundantly taught in the holy oricles of God</P>
<P>Now, Sir, if you will take this maxim; and make it your compa&s;s, as being a plain doctrine of &s;cripture, you will &s;teer clear of the rock up|on which Mr. F&mdash;r has &s;plit, and made &s;hip|wreck. And I pre&s;ume you can avoid it in no other way: For &s;uppo&s;e God had &s;uffered Adam to propagate his fallen race without ever provid|ing a Saviour for them. They would as Mr. F&mdash;r tells us, have had nothing but <HI>helple&s;&s;ne&s;s;</HI> nothing but <HI>&s;in.</HI> They mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have gone on in &s;in and wickedne&s;s. But this nece&s;&s;ity
<PB N="33" REF="026710_0031_0FD1633F0E2A5BA8">
would have been wholly of the <HI>moral</HI> kind; or &s;uch as would have proceeded from the <HI>&s;tate</HI> of their wills. And &s;uch a nece&s;&s;ity we have found to be perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with blame and puni&s;h|ment, and con&s;equently with a righteous judge|ment. Therefore, God could, con&s;i&s;tently with his perfections, have blamed and puni&s;hed the fal|len race of Adam, for their actual and per&s;onal wickedne&s;s; notwith&s;tanding they would have been under an ab&s;olute <HI>moral</HI> nece&s;&s;ity of com|mitting it. Allowing this to be the ca&s;e, we may clearly &s;ee how it is that, after the fall, righteou&s;|ne&s;s could not come by the law to any man. Con|&s;equently we may &s;ee the great nece&s;&s;ity of a Saviour, and al&s;o the grace there is in the gift of Chri&s;t as a redeemer.</P>
<P>From what I have here &s;aid, you may form &s;ome idea, Sir, of the great di&s;tinction which is made between <HI>natural</HI> nece&s;&s;ity and inability, and <HI>moral</HI> I have here but ju&s;t hinted to you the dif|ference. If you are di&s;po&s;ed to make further enquiery re&s;pecting this matter, I would refer you to what Pre&s;ident Edwards has &s;aid upon the &s;ubject in his piece on the human will. The whole of it is worthy of your clo&s;e attention. At the &s;ame time, by reading this book, and comparing the &s;ame with your favorite author's repre&s;enta|tion of it, you will &s;ee for your&s;elf one of Mr. F&mdash;r's gro&s;s mi&s;repre&s;entations. The mo&s;t charitable conclu&s;ion is that this writer had never read it.</P>
<P>From what I have here &s;uggected you may &s;ee al&s;o, if you act a candid part, where the fallacy lies of Mr. F&mdash;r's rea&s;oning again&s;t the Calvi|ni&s;tic
<PB N="34" REF="026710_0032_0FD163408C4501A8">
doctrines of the &s;overeignty of grace, the ab&s;olute decrees of God, regeneration, faith and repentance. The whole force of a great part of his arguments again&s;t the&s;e doctrines, depends upon the truth of this one propo&s;ition, That there is no difference between <HI>moral</HI> nece&s;&s;ity and inability, and <HI>natural,</HI> as to nature. In all his rea&s;onings, declamations, and addre&s;&s;es to the pa&s;&s;ions of mankind with regard to the&s;e things, he made a practice of comparing the nece&s;&s;ity and inability which ari&s;e from the &s;tate of the will or heart; to the nece&s;&s;ity and inability which ari&s;e from the &s;tate of the bodily powers or natural faculties. That this is in fact the ca&s;e every one mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible who has ever read this author's works.</P>
<P>But, Sir, where has Mr. F&mdash;r &s;hown that the&s;e two kinds of nece&s;&s;ity and inability are not thus different in their nature? He has not &s;o much as attempted it in any of his works whch I have read: Whereas this ought to have been one of his fir&s;t &s;teps. Since, therefore, he has taken no notice of this di&s;tinction between <HI>natural</HI> nece&s;&s;ity and <HI>moral,</HI> we who make it, and maintain that it is taken from &s;cripture, &s;hall, till it is &s;hown to be groundle&s;s, con&s;ider as vain and futile all his argu|ments, declamations, and addre&s;&s;es who&s;e whole force depend upon there being no &s;uch di&s;tinction in nature. The greater part of the learned world make this di&s;tinction. And I tru&s;t that the &s;crip|tures make it. And it is a di&s;tinction upon which much indeed depends. If, therefore, you would act a fair and candid part, never more u&s;e argu|ments who&s;e whole force depends upon there be|ing
<PB N="35" REF="026710_0033_0FD163420E4E8D48">
no &s;uch di&s;tinction; till you have &s;hown that it is groundle&s;s.</P>
<P>Finally, from what has been &s;aid, you may &s;ee al&s;o how difficult it is to form a con&s;i&s;tent &s;cheme of religion, or to reconcile the doctrines of &s;crip|ture with each other, without granting that <HI>mo|ral</HI> nece&s;&s;ity and <HI>moral</HI> inability are con&s;i&s;tent with commands and prohibitions, prai&s;e and blame, rewards and puni&s;hments. No writer ever la|boured harder perhaps to exclude all kinds of ne|ce&s;&s;ity and inability from his &s;cheme, than Mr. F&mdash;r has done. But with what &s;ucce&s;s, I leave for the candid, who may read what I have here written, to judge. For my own part I am fully and firmly of the opinion that the doctrines of &s;cripture can be reconciled with each other, in no other way than by allowing that <HI>moral</HI> ne|ce&s;&s;ity to do evil is con&s;i&s;tent with commands, with blame and puni&s;hment; and that <HI>moral</HI> nece&s;|&s;ity to do good is con&s;i&s;tent with commands, with prai&s;e and reward. But I profe&s;s to be one whole mind is open to conviction. And I hope that you will manife&s;t your&s;elf to be a &s;erious and can|did enquirer after divine truth. May He, then, who is the Wi&s;e Di&s;po&s;er of all events, lead to a &s;aving knowledge of the truth, you,</P>
