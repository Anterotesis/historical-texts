<P>WE find, <HI>v.</HI> 13. that when <HI>Paul</HI> had Preach'd at <HI>Berea,</HI> there came wicked Jews from <HI>The&s;|&s;alonica,</HI> and &s;o &s;tir'd up the People, that 'twas dange|rous for him to &s;tay any longer there. Where upon, leaving <HI>Silas</HI> and <HI>Timotheus</HI> behind him, <HI>Paul</HI> him&s;elf came to <HI>Athens, v.</HI> 14, 15.

<PB N="2" REF="002006_0003_0FBA802E557EBF20">thus left behind; <HI>His &s;pirit was stirred in him, when he &s;aw the City wholly given to Ido|latry.</HI> The City was wholly <HI>given to Idola|try,</HI> to the <HI>Wor&s;hipping of Idols;</HI> this was a gro&s;s, abominable Crime, highly provoking to GOD, and hurtful to their own Souls. And when the holy Apo&s;tle &s;aw, ob&s;erv'd, con&s;ider'd, this plain, this great and high|handed wickedne&s;s; then his <HI>Spirit,</HI> his Heart <HI>was &s;tirred in him.

<Q>We &s;hould have a quick, lively &s;en&s;e and di&s;like of, Zeal and Indignation again&s;t, the plain, known Sins of others.</Q>
<P>For the preventing of Mi&s;takes, it may be premi&s;ed.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Our first and chief re&s;entment &s;hould be again&s;t our own Sins.</HI> How odd and &s;trange would it look, to pluck at a <HI>Mote</HI> in our Brother's eye, and &s;uffer a <HI>Beam</HI> in our own? <HI>Mat.</HI> 7.3.&mdash;5. We &s;hall never duely abhor Sin in others, if we don't heartily hate and loath it in our &s;elves. Deepe&s;t Self aba&s;e|ment and holy &s;hame, well becomes us for our own Sins. The be&s;t of Saints have expre&s;s'd great Self aba&s;ement for Sin. <HI>Abraham</HI> call'd him&s;elf, <HI>Dust and A&s;hes,</HI> Gen. 18.27. <HI>Job</HI> &s;aid (Chap. 42.6.) <HI>I ab|hor my &s;elf, and repent in du&s;t and a&s;hes.</HI> The P&s;almi&s;t &s;aid, P&s;al. 73.22. <HI>So fooli&s;h was I, and ignorant; I was as a beast before thee.

The &s;trong|e&s;t, &s;harpe&s;t re&s;entments, &s;hould be again&s;t our own Sins. An univer&s;al abhorrence of Sin in our &s;elves, fits us the better to ap|pear again&s;t Sin in others.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>We &s;hould manifest Charity and For|bearance, towards Weak, Infirm Chri&s;tians.</HI> If we have good ground to believe, that they are Orthodox as to the Main Fundamen|tal Articles of Faith; that they mean well and hone&s;tly, con&s;cienciou&s;ly Indeavouring to avoid known Sin, and to practice the duties of Chri&s;tianity according to their be&s;t light; I &s;ay, as for &s;uch, we &s;hould love them, bear with them, <HI>Receive them tho' not to donbtful di&s;putations,</HI> Rom. 14.1. <HI>We then that are &s;trong, ought to bear the In|firmities of the weak, and not to plea&s;e our &s;elves,</HI> Rom. 15.1. This holy Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> who was &s;o zealous again&s;t plain, known, flagrant wickedne&s;s in others; was yet very tender and conde&s;cending to Weak, Infirm Chri&s;tians. <HI>To the weak, became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means &s;ave &s;ome,</HI> 1 Cor. 9.22. <HI>Bear ye one ano|thers burthens, and &s;o fulfill the law of Christ,</HI> Gal. 6.2.</P>
