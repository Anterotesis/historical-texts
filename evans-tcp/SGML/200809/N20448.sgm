<HEAD>NARRATIVE, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ON the 24th day of March, 1794, the brig Falmouth failed from Port Royal, Jamaica, beund to Belfa&s;t, in Ireland, to which place &s;he belonged. At the time &s;he failed, the following per&s;ons were on board &mdash;</P>
<P><HI>William Gordon,</HI> Ma&s;ter; <HI>Francis Turner,</HI> Mate; <HI>Henry Gihnote, John Doutbard, &mdash; Povd, &mdash; Carrol, Jo&s;eph York,</HI> (Mariners) <HI>William Wil|iams,</HI> a Cabin Boy; <HI>Jo&s;eph Porter,</HI> a pa&s;&s;enger;</P>
<P>Nothing material happened on the voyage, 'till two of the hands, Boyd and Carrol, were taken &s;ick. and died, apparently of a violent fever, the one immediately after the other.&mdash;During their illne&s;s, the Captain u&s;ed to enquire after their &s;ituation, and to look at them down the hatchway, and &s;end them frequently from the cabin both Soup and Coffee.</P>
<P>After the death of the&s;e men, which happened previous, to the 2d of May, there appeared an ap|parent difference in the conduct of the Captain, which &s;hewed it&s;elf in particular in&s;tances of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> treatment towards one another of the crew, whom he charged with an intention to poi&s;on him, and to run away with the ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>On the &s;econd of May, he took from the Mate a Quadrant, which he had given to him &s;oon af|ter their failing; and likewi&s;e took from him his books of Navigation; taking into his own hands the entire navigation of the ve&s;&s;el.</P>

Mr. Porter, the pa&s;&s;enger, was in an extreme ill &s;tate of health, and was &s;o feeble as to be con|fined to his bed, which was in the &s;tarboard &s;tate-|room. In this &s;ituation helay till the 24th of May, when the Mate being in the larboard &s;tate-room, and the Capt. and Mr. Porter's &s;ervant in the cabin, the Mate heard Capt. Corran in warm lan|guage, abu&s;ing Mr. Porter &s;wearing that he &s;hould not &s;tay any longer in the &s;tate-room, and ordering his Black Boy to go immediately and bring his ma&s;ter into the cabin. This the boy at|tempted; but finding him&s;elf unable to effect it; and Mr. Porter at the &s;ame time, begging for God's &s;ake, that he might be &s;uffered to lay where he was; the Capt. entered the &s;tate-room, and with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the black boy, took Mr. Porter, by force, out of his bed, and &s;upporting him, him&s;elf under one arm, und the Black Boy under the other, they brought him into the cabin he being unable to walk him&s;elf) and &s;at him down on a chair. The Captain then ordered the Black boy to bring out his ma&s;ters bed, and to make it up in the cabin, upon two che&s;ts belonging to Mr. Porter. This being done he compelled the black boy to lay his ma&s;ter on the bed, and then &s;ent for one of the top-gallant &s;tudding &s;ails, with which he made a &s;ort of a curtain to &s;urround the bed. After this tran&s;action, he ordered the black boy out of the cabin, and going upon deck, gave a general order, that neither the black boy, nor any other per&s;on, &s;hould come into the cabin without his leave, and that no per&s;on &s;hould con|cern him&s;elf with Mr. Porter, as he would take care of him him&s;elf.</P>

The 27th of May between 10 and 11 at night, the Capt. called Henry Gilmore, and ordered him to bring a light. When Gilmore came with the light, the Capt. gave him a drink of grog, and told him that he hoped he would be in his favor, and that he was not afraid of the law. Gilmore replied that he did not wi&s;h to be again&s;t him or any other per&s;on. The captain &s;oon after came upon deck, and de&s;ired that no per&s;on &s;hould be permitted to come into the cabin, without orders from him, that the watch then on deck, &s;hould give the &s;ame charge to the watch which was to &s;ucceed them. About a quarter pa&s;t 12 o'clock the whole crew were alarmed with the cries of Mr. Porter, exclaiming "Murder, Mur|der!!" Through a whole in the bulk head which parted the &s;teerage from the cabin, and by looking down the companion door into the cabin &s;everal of crew &s;aw captain Corran &s;triking at Mr. Porter as he lay in his bed, with a remarkable large and heavy cutla&s;s. After &s;triking him for &s;ome time, he de&s;i&s;ted for a &s;hort &s;pace, and coming up the companion ladder, began to abu&s;e Mr. Porter, damning him. and declaring he was not worth five pounds in the world. He then returned into the cabin again, and began to cut Mr. Porter as he had done before. Mr. Porter again cried out and begged the captain not to cut him &s;o, but to take a pi&s;tol and &s;hoot him. He damned him and &s;aid he would not &s;hoot him, but would cut him every half hour till day light. In a &s;hort time, Mr. Porter begged him to de&s;i&s;t, as he was dying; and it is &s;uppo&s;ed he expired about this time, as
<PB N="5" REF="026820_0005_0FD1D5C270CA72B0">
his cries were heard no more. Between one and twoo'clock, the captain came again upon deck, with a cutla&s;s in his hand, and &s;truck Mr. Porter's black boy, acro&s;s the &s;houlders, and bid him go down and dre&s;s his ma&s;ter's wounds. He al&s;o called for a light and went down with the boy into the cabin, and made &s;everal &s;trokes at Mr. Porter's body with the cutla&s;s, exclaiming, "What, damn you, are you a&s;leep?";</P>
<P>About day light the captain called John Douthard into the cabin, who on his entering it, found Mr. Porter with his knees on the cabin floor, and his face re&s;ting on the bed; apparent|ly lifele&s;s. Capt. Corran ordered him to take hold of Mr. Porter's legs, and lift him on the bed. While Douthard was in the act of doing this, he made &s;everal &s;trokes at the body over his head, which &s;o intimidated Douthard, that he dropped the body and ran upon deck, acquainting his companions that the captain had murdered their pa&s;&s;enger. At 4 o'clock the captain came upon deck, and ordered Douthard to go down in|to the cabin, and &s;ew Mr. Porter up in a blanket, and told him that Mr. Porter's &s;ervant &s;hould a&s;|&s;i&s;t him. Douthard refu&s;ing, he &s;eized him and compelled him to go down into the cabin. By the captain's order, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the boy, he laid Mr. Porter on one of his own blankets, &s;ewed him up in it, and tied a white handkerchief round his head. The body was mangled in a manner &s;hocking to humanity; there were large ga&s;hes about the hips, above a foot long and three or four inches deep, one car totally cut off, the
<PB N="6" REF="026820_0006_0FD1D5C413F7D100">
no&s;e almo&s;t cut through, the right eye forced out of the &s;ocket and hanging down the cheek &s;u&s;|pended by a bloody membrance; the arms had upwards of twenty wounds from one to three inches deep: The &s;heet was very bloody, and much clotted blood on the cabin floor. The corps was brought on deck, and laid upon a board in the gangway. From the companion door to the gangway, there was a con&s;iderable quantity of blood which had ran through the blanket as they were carrying the body along. While the corps was lying in the gangway, the captain came on deck, leaned over the quarter rail, covered his eyes with his hands, and appeared for &s;ome minutes much confu&s;ed. He was rou&s;ed from his reverie by John Douthard, who a&s;ked him if he &s;hould heave the decea&s;ed overboard. He &s;eemed &s;tarted by the que&s;tion&mdash;but bid them <HI>"away with him."</HI> The body was accordingly committed to the &s;ea; immediately after this he ordered the ve&s;&s;el to be kept away N. W. and &s;et|ting the &s;tudding &s;ails.</P>
<P>On the 29th of May the capt. &s;ent &s;everal me&s;|&s;ages to the mate, de&s;iring him to come upon deck, and declaring that he would not hurt him. The mate at length came on deck, and being afraid to go a&s;t. remained before the windla&s;s: capt. Corran ob&s;erving his &s;hyne&s;s, and that his <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> was perpetually on him, told him, <HI>he kept a dam<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters"> &s;harp look out.</HI> About noon, Henry Gilmore, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> had been &s;teering, was relieved from the helm, &amp; came forward where the mate was, who enquir|ed of him what cour&s;e they were &s;teering. He informed him N. W. On which the mate repli|ed,
<PB N="7" REF="026820_0007_0FD1D5C57B744A88">
that that cour&s;e would fetch no port in Europe, and that he was apprehen&s;ive that the captain had ill de&s;igns both on them and the ve&s;&s;el. The mate then con&s;ulted as in my of the crew as he conven|iently could, who agreed to take the fir&s;t oppor|tunity to &s;ecure the captain. About an hour af|terwards, the captain came on deck, and having walked to the tiller ropes, and turned round to proceed down the deck, Jo&s;eph York, who was then at the helm, &s;eized his arms behind, and &s;truggling with him, the re&s;t of the crew came to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, bound him, and brought him in|to the cabin, where they &s;ecured his hands with a pair of hand cuffs, which they found in his che&s;t.</P>
<P>Previous; to his impri&s;onment when he ordered the ve&s;&s;el to be &s;teered N. W. he informed the crew that they were near the Engli&s;h Channel: But on the 30th of May when the mate has got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Quadrant, and was enabled to take as ob&s;ervation, he found they were very near the attitude of this place, and in about half an hour after they &s;aw land; but a thick fog coming on, they were not able to make a harbour <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> four days afterwards often they. ca&s;e to anchor in Ro&s;e Bay, between La Have and Lunenburgh. On &s;earch|ing for the Books or navigation, after confining the Capt. they found that he had cut out of every book the table of the Sur's declination. Immediately on their arrival there, the more went on &s;hore, and made report to the magi&s;trates of the tran&s;action on <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> brig Falmouth, &mdash;The Capt. was carried on &s;hore, and the occupations of the people being taken, he was committed to pri&s;on and afterwarsd brought to Halifax, were the court of admiralty was a&s;&s;embled on Friday the 11th of July at the court house, for the trial of this un|fortunate man, for the murder of Jo&s;eph Porter, a gentleman who took pa&s;&s;age on board the brig Falmouth, at Port Royal, Jamaica.

On that day the trial commenced, and continued, by ad|joinment, till Tue&s;day, when the examination on the part of the crown being ended; the pri&s;oner was called upon by the court to make his defence: But declining to offer any thing in his defence: he was given recommitted, and the court adjourned to also o'clock on Wedne&s;day.</P>

After a &s;hort period the court was again opened, and the pri&s;oner brought to the bear, when his Excellency governer Westfourth, the pre&s;ident of the court, addre&s;&s;ed the pri&s;oner, and declared, that the court having deliberately con&s;idered all the evidence which had been &s;ubmittes to them, were mani|fe&s;tly of opinion that he was guilty of the murder of Jo&s;eph Porter. His Excellency then demanded of the pri&s;oner if he had any thing to args, why Ju&s;tice of death &s;hould not be pronounced upon him. After be&s;itating a few minutes he began as imperfect <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of the proceedings on board the brig Falmouth, from her &s;ailing from Jamaica, pa&s;&s;ing over the period upon the murder was committed, of which, however, be acclared be was not guilty Having nothing further to offer, be pro&s;&s;ced the lawful &s;entence of death upon him; and he was adjudged to be hanged on Monday the 21&s;t of July, between the hours of 10 and one o'clock, at point plea&s;ant, between the abbing and &s;erving of the tide.</P>
