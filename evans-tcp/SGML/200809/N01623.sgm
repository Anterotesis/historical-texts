<Q><BIBL>ISAIAH LVII. 2.</BIBL>
<P>He &s;hall enter into peace: they &s;hall re&s;t in their beds, each one walking in his uprightne&s;s.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN the beginning of this Chapter the Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> gives an account of the degeneracy and &s;tupidity of the Times wherein he lived. <HI>The righteous peri&s;heth, and no man layeth it to heart</HI>&mdash;They did not duly con&s;ider the operation of God's Hand in taking away the Righteous by Death, nor were they &s;uitably affected with it. They
<PB N="2" REF="001927_0003_0FBA1CFF26D479B8">did nor di&s;cern the &s;igns of the Times, nor would they ob&s;erve the warning which God gave them of approaching Calamities, in the removal of &s;uch as were Upright before God in their Ge|neration: <HI>None con&s;idering that the righ|teous is taken away from the evil to come.</HI></P>
<P>In the Second Ver&s;e wherein is our Text, the Prophet comforts the People of God from the con&s;ideration of the Peaceful End of the Upright, and of the Re&s;t which they enjoy after Death. <HI>He &s;hall enter into peace:</HI> or, he &s;hall go in peace; or as &s;ome read the Words, Peace &s;hall come; <HI>to wit,</HI> to him. They go in peace when they leave this trouble|&s;ome World; and their departed Spirits are refre&s;h'd and comforted in the Para|dice of God.</P>
<P><HI>They &s;hall re&s;t in their beds.</HI> As their Souls are taken to a place of perfect Peace; &s;o their Bodies are laid in the Grave where they &s;hall re&s;t 'till the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="7 letters">ction, when the &s;hadows of Death
<PB N="3" REF="001927_0004_0FBA1D0095AD02E0">&s;hall be turn'd into the light of the Morn|ing. Here's a &s;udden change of the number, which is not unu&s;ual in the Prophets. <HI>Each one walking in his upright|ne&s;s;</HI> or, that walketh uprightly, or in &s;traightne&s;s, making &s;traight paths in the way of God's Commandments, without declining to the right hand, or to the left. <HI>Before Him:</HI> So <HI>Arias Mon|tanus,</HI> and others read the Word: i. e. before <HI>God;</HI> as in His &s;ight, and &s;eeing Him who is Invi&s;ible.</P>
<P>In the Words we may ob&s;erve, 1. The Character and De&s;cription of the Chil|dren of God: They walk in Uprightne&s;s. While they live they walk with God in Sincerity, ordering their &s;teps according to the rules laid down in His Word. 2. We have the Privilege and Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of &s;uch a&s;&s;erted and de&s;cribed: <HI>He &s;hall enter into peace: They &s;hall re&s;t in their beds.</HI></P>

Here we may ob&s;erve, that this Word as u&s;ed in the Scriptures, is of much the &s;ame import with Perfection. Sincerity, Integrity. As it is here u&s;ed, it can't intend <HI>Sinle&s;s Per|fection,</HI> We read, Eccl. 7.29. <HI>God hath made man upright; but they have &s;ought out many inventions.</HI> The Word for Man is <HI>Adam.</HI> God made our fir&s;t Pa|rents <HI>right</HI> in &s;inle&s;s Perfection: But <HI>Adam</HI> &s;inn'd, and we in him. And &s;ince the Fall all are conceiv'd in &s;in, and go a&s;tray from the Womb. And there is no Man but hath the remains of this Original Corruption abiding in him. The Law which is the rule of Right be|tween God and Man, and an Eternal rule of Righteou&s;ne&s;s demands perfect Obedience, and threatens the Cur&s;e upon the lea&s;t defect. Gal. 3.10. <HI>Cur&s;ed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the Book of the Law to do them.</HI> And therefore the P&s;almi&s;t deprecates <HI>God's being &s;trict to mark ini|quity,</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="001927_0007_0FBA28AFF87E72B8">P&s;al. 143.2. The holie&s;t Men that ever lived had Sin remaining in them. <HI>Noah</HI> was a ju&s;t Man, and per|foot in his Generations, <HI>Gen.</HI> 6.9. And yet he was overtaken with the Sin of Drunkenne&s;s. <HI>Job</HI> was perfect and up|right: And yet he makes that confe&s;&s;ion, Job 9.20. <HI>If I ju&s;tify my &s;elf, mine own mouth &s;hall condemn me: if I &s;ay I am perfect, it &s;hall al&s;o prove me perver&s;e.</HI> How pa&s;&s;ionately doth the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> cry out, <HI>O wretched man that I am! who &s;hall deliver me from the body of this death?</HI> There was never any Man &s;ince the Fall, excepting the Man CHRIST JESUS, (who is GOD as well as Man) per&s;ectly free from Sin. Indeed God is &s;aid to &s;ee no iniquity in <HI>Jacob,</HI> or per|ver&s;ene&s;s in <HI>I&s;rael.</HI> The perfect Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t covers all the Sins of His People; God beholds no iniquity in them &s;o as to impute it. However, all want of conformity to, or tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the Law of God, is Sin, under the
<PB N="7" REF="001927_0008_0FBA28B1496E42C8">Covenant of <HI>Grace,</HI> as well as under the Covenant of <HI>Works:</HI> But here is the difference; the Sins of Believers do not expo&s;e them to the condemnation of the Law, and to the Sword of Vindictive Ju&s;tice; becau&s;e their Surety hath born their iniquities, &amp; made Reconciliation for them. The Children of God know but in part, and are &s;anctified but in part. Eccl. 7.20. <HI>There is not a ju&s;t man upon earth that doeth good and &s;inneth not.</HI> While they live in this World they &s;in daily, and therefore they live a life of Repentance and Godly Sorrow, and mu&s;t daily go to that <HI>Fountain which is &s;et open to the hou&s;e of David,&mdash;for &s;in and for uncleanne&s;s.</HI> The be&s;t Men upon Earth come &s;hort in every duty: None are able perfectly to keep the Com|mandments of God. Their hou&s;es of Clay mu&s;t be pulled down, before the lepro&s;y of Sin will be wholly taken a|way; and their Souls mu&s;t be &s;eparated from their Bodies by Death, before they
<PB N="8" REF="001927_0009_0FBA28B2E4020098">can attain the &s;potle&s;s purity of <HI>the &s;pi|rits of ju&s;t Men made perfect.</HI> The brighte&s;t Lights that ever &s;hone in the Church Militant have had their &s;pots.</P>
<P>But to &s;peak Po&s;itively.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Walking in uprightne&s;s pre&s;uppo&s;eth this, that the Dominion of &s;in is de&s;troyed in God's People, and the image of God, in all the Graces of the Spirit, is created in them.</HI> Every Child of God is renew'd in the whole Man, after His Image. All the Divine Laws mu&s;t be written on our hearts by the Finger of God, and we mu&s;t be &s;et right with God, or our ways can't be upright before Him. Every Man is by nature under the dominion of lu&s;t, and the way of &s;in is the way of his own heart. And therefore unle&s;s God <HI>create in us a clean heart, and renew within us a right &s;pirit;</HI> it is as much impo&s;&s;ible for us to walk in uprightne&s;s, as it is for the Dead to ari&s;e and walk. The motion of natural Bodies is according to their principle, and the laws impre&s;s'd
<PB N="9" REF="001927_0010_0FBA28B4DCF1F920">upon them. And thus the motions of the Soul in moral actions are according to the bia&s;s that is upon it. While our inclinations are <HI>corrupt,</HI> our ways will be <HI>unclean.</HI> While we are governed by the law in our members, we can't walk in uprightne&s;s. This doth therefore nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;e that the People of God <HI>are renewed in the &s;pirit of their minds;</HI> being deliver'd from the domi|nion of &s;in. Their Under&s;tandings are &s;avingly enlightened to &s;ee the path of Life; their Wills renew'd, &s;o that they chu&s;e the ways of God's Te&s;timonies: their Affections &s;anctified, and by them their Souls are forwarded in the way of God's Commandments. Thus every Power is re&s;cued from the bondage of <HI>Corruption;</HI> and <HI>Grace</HI> takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of every faculty. The image of God is engraven on the hearts of His Children in every line of it. There is an inte|grity and perfection of parts in the new Man: For of Chri&s;t's fulne&s;s they receive
<PB N="10" REF="001927_0011_0FBA28B6EBCF1A68">and Grace for Grace; tho' it be imper|fect as to degrees. And tho' every lu&s;t remains in &s;ome degree, yet there is no lu&s;t but what is ca&s;t down from it's u|&s;urped Throne. Every Child of God is born of the Spirit, and is denominated from his better part, a <HI>perfect and up|right Man.</HI> All old things are pa&s;s'd away, and all things are become new.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Walking in uprightne&s;s intends that we make the Word of God our Rule in our way, &amp; have a re&s;pect to all His Command|ments.</HI> The Upright endeavour that their obedience may be extended in &s;ome good mea&s;ure, in proportion to the breadth of God's Law; and none of God's Commands are grievous to them. They delight in the <HI>whole</HI> Law, and are obedient to every Precept in it; they make Con&s;cience not only of obeying tho&s;e Commands which immediately re|&s;pect God, but al&s;o of tho&s;e which re&s;pect their Neighbour. They neither &s;epa|rate the Tables of the Law, nor da&s;h them
<PB N="11" REF="001927_0012_0FBA28BB71A5DAA8">in pieces one again&s;t another. They do not pick &amp; chu&s;e, and &s;ay, The&s;e Com|mands we will do, tho&s;e we will leave undone; but earne&s;tly de&s;ire that their hearts may be directed to keep all God's Commandments. They allow not them&s;elves in the omi&s;&s;ion of any known duty. Secret as well as open duties bear the &s;tamp of the Divine Authority, and therefore are impartially regarded by them. The Children of God take His Word for a <HI>light to their feet, and a lamp to their path.</HI> In the Law of God our duty is marked out to us, and the way to Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s laid out before us; and therefore the Upright do take care to walk in the Law of the Lord, and dare not allow them&s;elves in pa&s;&s;ing o|ver the&s;e lines and bounds which their Lawgiver hath &s;et and de&s;cribed there|in. They make it their bu&s;ine&s;s to or|der their Conver&s;ation according to this Law of Liberty. They take the Word of God for their directory, and wor&s;hip
<PB N="12" REF="001927_0013_0FBA28BC89818860">Him according to His own In&s;titutions and Appointments. They labour to under&s;tand the Orders and Ordinances of God's Hou&s;e as revealed in His Word, and keep clo&s;e to them. In a Word, the <HI>Grace</HI> of God which hath appeared to them in the Go&s;pel, teaches them to live &s;oberly righteou&s;ly and godly in this pre&s;ent evil World.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Walking in uprightne&s;s intends that we hate every fal&s;e way.</HI> The upright do not allow them&s;elves to walk in any forbidden path, or to turn a&s;ide to the crooked ways of &s;in. There is no way of wickedne&s;s, tho' it &s;eem to be never &s;o plea&s;ant and gainful; but what they heartily de&s;ire to for&s;ake. They lay a&s;ide the &s;in that doth <HI>mo&s;t ea&s;ily be&s;et them,</HI> and thro' the Spirit they mortify the deeds of the Fle&s;h, even tho&s;e be|loved lu&s;ts, which their Con&s;titution, Employment, or Cover&s;ation might mo&s;t incline them to. P&s;al. 18.23. <HI>I was al&s;o upright before him: and I kept my &s;elf</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="001927_0014_0FBA28BE85EED450"><HI>from mine iniquity.</HI> They are cleans'd from <HI>&s;ecret faults,</HI> and kept back from <HI>pre&s;umptuous &s;ins,</HI> &s;o that they have not dominion over them.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Walking in uprightne&s;s intends that Believers do walk as being &s;en&s;ible that God's Eye is upon them, and as &s;eeing Him who is Invi&s;ible.</HI> We have already ob|&s;erved that &s;ome tran&s;late the Word, <HI>before Him.</HI> They order their Life and Conver&s;ation under a realizing view of the Pre&s;ence of God. They believe that truth, Prov. 15.3. <HI>The Eyes of the Lord are in every place beholding the evil and the good.</HI> And they act as of &s;incerity in the &s;ight of God. The <HI>Hypocrite</HI> is ready to &s;ay in his heart, <HI>Doth God know, can he judge through the dark cloud.</HI> But the Upright Man makes that con|fe&s;&s;ion of his Faith, P&s;al. 139.3. <HI>Thou compa&s;se&s;t my path, and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways.</HI> And this belief of the Omni&s;cience and Om|nipre&s;ence of GOD governs him in his
<PB N="14" REF="001927_0015_0FBA28C0A9456630">walk, and makes him take care to ap|prove him&s;elf to God, by having his Conver&s;ation <HI>in &s;implicity &amp; godly &s;ince|rity.</HI> The Children of God do live in Obedience to that command, Gen. 17.1. <HI>I am the Almighty God, walk before me, and he thou perject.</HI> They live and act under this apprehen&s;ion, that they are continually in the pre&s;ence of that God who is their Judge and Rewarder: And therefore they de&s;ire <HI>truth in the inward parts,</HI> and &s;ee to it that the inward tem|per and frame of their minds be agrea|ble to their outward profe&s;&s;ion. By Faith they &s;ee Him who is Invi&s;ible to &s;en&s;e. They are &s;en&s;ible that He &s;ees all their tho'ts afar off, and therefore walk cir|cum&s;pectly. They behold God in His Providential Di&s;pen&s;ations, wherein He pa&s;&s;eth before them; and they labour to keep their eyes fixed upon Him in all their ways, and to act as in His &s;ight. This is to walk in Uprightne&s;s; and &s;uch may appeal to God and &s;ay with
<PB N="15" REF="001927_0016_0FBA28C51A84C1E0"><HI>Hezekiah, Lord thou knowe&s;t that I have walked with an upright heart.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Walking in uprightne&s;s implies that we have upright Aims and Intentions in our Lives and Actions.</HI> Believers do make the Glory of God their chief and ultimate end. As far as we are &s;incere and upright we have a &s;ingle eye and pure aims; and labour to move in a direct and &s;traight line to|wards that glorious End, the advance|ment of God's Honour. In this re&s;pect, <HI>Their eyes look right on, and their eye-lids look &s;traight before them,</HI> as Prov. 4.25. The Upright &s;eek to promote God's Glory in all their ways: <HI>Whether they eat or drink, or whatever they do, they do all to the Glory of God.</HI> And endeavour to &s;ubordinate their inferiour intere&s;ts to this grand De&s;ign.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>It intends that they act thus in the whole cour&s;e of their Lives.</HI> A Man's way is that which he accu&s;toms him&s;elf to. Agreably, to walk in uprightne&s;s,
<PB N="16" REF="001927_0017_0FBA28C64F276118">is to be upright at all times, and under all circum&s;tances. Integrity and up|rightne&s;s do pre&s;erve God's People in all company, in all conditions of life, and in every affair they engage in. This is the way and manner of their life. They are upright in a con&s;tant and continued cour&s;e of actions. In the frame and tenour of their lives they are upright, exerci&s;ing them&s;elves in this, to <HI>keep a Con&s;cience void of offence both towards God and towards Men.</HI> Indeed the Upright Man may fall once and again. They do &s;ometimes go out of the way of God's Commandments; but then they do not <HI>walk</HI> in the coun&s;el of the ungod|ly, nor <HI>&s;tand</HI> in the way of &s;inners. Tho' they fall &s;even times, yet they ri&s;e again by Repentance, and return unto the Lord. The Upright are &s;teady and con&s;tant in walking in the path of God's Commandments; they per&s;evere in their duty till they fini&s;h their cour&s;e, and ob|tain the end of their Faith. P&s;al. 119.33.
<PB N="17" REF="001927_0018_0FBA28C7C96EEAC0"><HI>Teach me, O Lord, the way of thy &s;tatutes, and I &s;hall keep it unto the end.</HI> Thus we have briefly con&s;idered a few parti|culars, to illu&s;trate the Character which is here given of the Righteous, when it is &s;aid, That <HI>each one of them walketh in his uprightne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>PROP. II. <HI>It is their Happine&s;s that they &s;hall enter into Peace, and re&s;t in their Graves, as in Beds.</HI> We proceed now to con&s;ider the Privilege &amp; Ble&s;&s;ed|ne&s;s of the Upright.</P>
<P>In this World God's Providence to|wards the Righteous and Wicked is very promi&s;cuous, &s;o that no man knoweth love or hatred by all that is before them. Eccl. 9.2. <HI>All things come alike to all.</HI> There is one event to the righ|teous and to the wicked&mdash; Job 9.22. <HI>He de&s;troyeth the perfect and the wicked.</HI> The Upright mu&s;t die as well as the Sinner, and to an eye of &s;en&s;e, the Righteous peri&s;heth; But then, <HI>Precious
<PB N="18" REF="001927_0019_0FBA28CD1C3826D0">in the &s;ight of the Lord is the death of his Saints.</HI> When they go the way of all the Earth, they go in Peace. Every Upright Man is a Son of Peace. The Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t hath purcha&s;ed Peace for His People, and that in the mo&s;t comprehen&s;ive &s;en&s;e of the word, and He will be&s;tow it upon them. P&s;al. 84.11. <HI>For the Lord God is a &s;un and &s;hield: the Lord will give grace and glory: no good thing will he withold from them that walk uprightly.</HI> When our SAVIOUR was about to leave this World He bequeath'd Peace to His Di&s;ciples as a rich Legacy. Joh. 14.27. <HI>Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you,</HI>&mdash; The Lord Je|&s;us Chri&s;t is our Peace-maker. Col. 1.20.&mdash;<HI>Having made peace thro' the blood of his Cro&s;s&mdash;The cha&s;ti&s;ements of our Peace were upon Him.</HI> He who is the Fathers only begotten Son, in whom He is ever well plea&s;ed; was brui&s;ed and wounded for the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of His People, that God might with Ho|nour
<PB N="19" REF="001927_0020_0FBA28CF92088420">to all His Attributes, receive them into favour, and embrace them in the Arms of His Everla&s;ting Love. God hid His Face from Him for a time, when He uttered that &s;trong and vehement Cry, <HI>My God! My God! Why ha&s;t thou for&s;aken me?</HI> Now, this was that His People might enjoy the manife&s;tations of His Love, and walk up and down in the light of His Countenance.</P>
<P>And as our Lord Died to purcha&s;e this great and comprehen&s;ive Good for His People; &s;o He ever Lives to com|municate it to them. Now He is in Hea|ven, He doth not leave them Comfort|le&s;s; but comes unto them in the holy Influences and Con&s;olations of His Spi|rit, who is the Comforter. All Divine Peace is laid up in Him, He is the <HI>proton decticon,</HI> the fir&s;t Recipient; God hath anointed Him with the Oyl of gladne&s;s <HI>above his fellows,</HI> and from Him who is the Head this flows down to the Mem|bers of His My&s;tical Body, as the Oyl
<PB N="20" REF="001927_0021_0FBA28D0CEE5B498">that anointed the Head of <HI>Aaron</HI> ran down to the skirts of his Garments. In His light they &s;ee light. <HI>Being ju&s;tify'd by Faith they have Peace with God.</HI> Being deliver'd from the guilt and bondage of Sin, they have peace of Con&s;cience and joy in the Holy Gho&s;t; And thro' Chri&s;t become Heirs to the Inheritance of the Saints in Light. Thus I have endea|voured to &s;how the ground and founda|tion of that Peace which the Righteous do and &s;hall enjoy. I proceed to &s;peak more directly to the Propo&s;ition before us, in a few Particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Sometimes God gives unto the Upright abundance of peace, and more than ordinary tranquillity of mind towards the end of their lives; &s;o that they fini&s;h their cour&s;e with Joy.</HI> God re&s;erves the be&s;t Wine 'till la&s;t, and gives the Upright &s;trong and refre&s;hing Cordials when they lie upon a Death-Bed, and &s;tand in mo&s;t need of them. Thus it is &s;ometimes, and it may be many times, when thro' their weak|ne&s;&s;es,

<P>A Per&s;on of this Character, the Ho|nourable Major-General WINTHROP, was carried to his Sepulchre the la&s;t Week. He was de&s;cended of Honour|able Ance&s;tors, who were famous in their Generation, and their Names are de&s;ervedly precious in <HI>New-England.</HI></P>
<P>His Excellent Grand-Father
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The Honourable JOHN WINTHROP <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></NOTE> was One of tho&s;e Worthies who left a plea|&s;ant Land, and fair Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, that they might follow their Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t into this part of the New World, when it was an howling Wilderne&s;s; and enjoy Communion with Him in the purity of His Ordinances. He was a principal Founder of this Town, and of
<PB N="44" REF="001927_0045_0FBA2912DBA0B930">this Province, where he was for many Years Elected Governour, and Died while inve&s;ted with that Authority.</P>
<P>His Honourable Father <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">The Honourable JOHN WINTHROP <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></NOTE> was for &s;e|veral Years an A&s;&s;i&s;tant of this Colony, and afterwards the Governour of <HI>Con|necticut,</HI> for whom He procur'd the <HI>Charter</HI> under which They now enjoy their Precious and Valuable Privileges.</P>

<P>This Honourable Per&s;on was Him|&s;elf a Friend and Father to his Country, and had the Religion and Liberties of <HI>New-England</HI> much at heart, being a Lover of Truth and Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>He was a skilful Phy&s;ician, and ge|nerou&s;ly gave, not only his <HI>Advice,</HI> but al&s;o his <HI>Medicines</HI> for the healing of the Sick, which by the Ble&s;&s;ing of
<PB N="45" REF="001927_0046_0FBA291446C0FD18">God, were made &s;ucce&s;sful for the Re|covery of many. He was well skill'd in Philo&s;ophy: But above all, we have good rea&s;on to believe that he had learnt CHRIST, and that he now Sleeps in JESUS.</P>
<P>It is an honour to <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> that it was the Place of his Nativity.</P>
<P>By this repeated and awful Bereave|ment there is a great Gap made in our Hedge. May the Repairer of our Breaches rai&s;e up and qualify &s;uch from time to time as &s;hall make up our Hedge, and &s;tand in the Gap.</P>
